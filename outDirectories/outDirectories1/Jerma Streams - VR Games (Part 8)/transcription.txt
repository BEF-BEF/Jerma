[0.76s -> 10.71s]  Hey, I have to talk a little low today because I turned my compressor way up because I'm going
[10.71s -> 21.59s]  to be standing kind of far away. Oh wait, Robo? What? Is it a Robo? Hello? What does it sound like?
[21.59s -> 32.14s]  It sounds like Kylo Ren. Not supposed to. Does it sound like Kylo Ren? How's this?
[33.43s -> 42.94s]  This reverb? There shouldn't be any reverb. How about now? Is that better? Is that a little
[42.94s -> 55.29s]  bit better? No. How would there be reverb right now? There shouldn't be reverb. Why are you
[55.37s -> 66.36s]  in a gym pool room? Is it two mics? It shouldn't be. Oh, wait a minute. I need to be alive. Listen
[66.36s -> 74.60s]  to this. Let me see what this sounds like. It sounds like a gym pool room. All right, hold on.
[74.60s -> 83.77s]  Let me see if I can hear what you're talking about. Gym. All right. Well, let me explain
[83.77s -> 92.02s]  something for a second. I have reinstalled Windows. Okay. So last night I reinstalled Windows,
[92.02s -> 111.75s]  got VR to work. Is it a gymnasium? So I got VR to work. Oh, shit. Hold on. Hello? Okay, let me see.
[112.87s -> 117.27s]  That sounds much better. That sounds better. Okay, so what happened was,
[118.49s -> 127.42s]  uh, yeah, I was listening to it at the same time. Fucking gymnasium. Okay, so that's better.
[127.42s -> 130.78s]  So we sound fine. Okay, good. That means I can turn the compressor back up and
[131.34s -> 135.58s]  because I'm gonna be standing far away. All right, good. We're good. So let me tell you the story
[135.58s -> 142.63s]  before we go over. Vive is back in action. Yes, I have no idea what the fuck happened. I've
[142.63s -> 149.51s]  reinstalled Windows. I reinstalled every program and now my Vive works again. I uninstalled every
[149.51s -> 155.59s]  driver. I uninstalled every program. I've reinstalled my Bluetooth. Guys, I downloaded a program
[156.15s -> 162.23s]  called like Super Driver Booster and it updated like 115 drivers on my computer
[163.78s -> 168.34s]  and it didn't work. So I just reinstalled. No, it's not a virus. The thing actually worked.
[171.02s -> 177.96s]  Windows fucks up everything. I have no idea. So yeah, I know this. Spoilers. You can hear it.
[177.96s -> 182.98s]  Let me turn it off. We're getting back into VR. I told you it was gonna happen somewhere
[182.98s -> 189.96s]  at the end of September and look at me. Here we are. It's a legit virus my grandmother would
[189.96s -> 196.18s]  download. Well, your your favorite internet streamer downloaded it. I'm your favorite,
[196.18s -> 202.23s]  right? I have to be. Come on. It's October. Yeah. What happened to Far Cry 1? I'll tell you what
[202.23s -> 209.51s]  happened to Far Cry 1. I reinstalled Windows. It got VR to work. So I'm playing VR and like I don't
[209.51s -> 214.39s]  think I even want to play Far Cry 1. I remember that game. That's the game that's like impossible
[214.39s -> 218.71s]  even on easy and the enemies can shoot you from like 30 miles outside the map and through walls.
[219.35s -> 228.62s]  Well, I don't want to play that game. Yeah, I would turn that. That would be like a Ratatouille
[228.62s -> 235.05s]  stream and you know it. Far Cry 1 sucks to be honest. Yeah, I'll play it. You know what? I'll
[235.05s -> 241.80s]  play it. Everybody is waiting for me to play. Everybody's waiting for me to play Half-Life
[241.80s -> 248.14s]  Alyx, but I'm not going to do that today. It's been like more than a year since I've gone into
[248.14s -> 254.46s]  VR at all. So I'm going to ease into it. We're going to start Half-Life Alyx tomorrow. That's
[254.46s -> 261.45s]  the stream tomorrow. I'm going to warm up with some fucking Chikootery board today and then
[261.45s -> 269.61s]  tomorrow is Half-Life Alyx. Yeah, fair enough. Yeah, I've spent like a year. Everything's set
[269.61s -> 274.33s]  up. It's ready to go. I'm just stalling because all my VR streams are like three hours long. So
[274.33s -> 278.33s]  I have to stall for like at least 10 minutes to add some, you know, content to the beginning of
[278.33s -> 286.73s]  the stream. I'll just shake up my fucking drink. All right, let me lower this because now you can
[286.73s -> 296.36s]  hear me. Tell me if it gets bad because I will try to fix it. All right, let's go. So the first
[296.36s -> 305.86s]  game we're going to play. Move over here. We're going to play Vacation Simulator. We're just easing
[305.86s -> 316.18s]  into it. Wait, I didn't fucking even tweet. Shit. This is a Tuber game. It's an ease into VR game.
[316.18s -> 324.20s]  Guys, I just like last time I have like 40 VR games that I downloaded. It's Chubby Bunny. No,
[324.20s -> 332.79s]  it's not Chubby Bunny time. Not on VR. What are you crazy? Okay, I just started typing Chubby Bunny
[333.35s -> 339.98s]  into my tweet. Like that's the thing I'm doing today. Chubby Bunny, come on in. Like that's
[339.98s -> 352.28s]  going to take three hours. Okay, let's see. What do I do? Yeah, VR. How about VR is back? That's
[352.28s -> 358.02s]  man. That's kind of that's too desperate. Like VR is back. Please come watch. VR meat and cheese.
[358.02s -> 370.65s]  No, that's what the title is. VR. Who cares? VR. That's it. VR meat and cheese. Sucks. Whatever.
[374.86s -> 380.39s]  Dude, I'm fucking laughing right now. I don't even know why. All right.
[380.39s -> 388.84s]  Why does it always default to German 98? Every time I type in my Twitch password into my Twitch
[388.84s -> 395.10s]  stream, I get this thing where it's like, oh, it auto goes to a Twitch channel called German 98.
[395.10s -> 402.10s]  And I'm like, that's not me, dude. Okay. I think we stalled long enough. It's time to go.
[402.74s -> 412.54s]  You leaked the password. All right, we're gonna have to see if this works. Well, here we go.
[413.91s -> 423.56s]  There you are. See, look, it's virtual reality. And me. So we are going to get started here.
[424.12s -> 437.45s]  I know I have idea. This is my coffee. He's here. It's him. The Reddit shelf. Can I tell you how
[437.45s -> 444.06s]  concerned I am today about this? I am really concerned that I'm going to hit this. I think
[444.06s -> 450.30s]  I'm going to move my entire VR setup into another room and just feed long cables into the room.
[452.60s -> 459.82s]  I have less space, guys, than last time I did VR. I can't move from here. If I go like two feet
[459.82s -> 468.17s]  that way or like two feet that way, I'm putting a hole in the wall. He got bigger. Nice. Did you
[468.17s -> 479.32s]  notice? Flip it when he does. I bet the whole thing's coming down. Look at how fucking annoying
[479.32s -> 488.26s]  this is. This is annoying. Why do they make these? This is, it's got spikes on it. Like it hurts to
[488.26s -> 494.66s]  hold this. It's like a challenge holding this fucking Starbucks cup. I don't even know why
[494.66s -> 502.71s]  they make these. It's a weapon. All right. You ready? I've stalled long enough. I'm wearing
[502.71s -> 508.12s]  pants, right? Let me put my headphones in. Make sure, you guys can hear this, right?
[509.66s -> 513.10s]  I can see the chat. Don't worry. I have the toolkit thing set up. Covered the game reward.
[513.10s -> 524.82s]  You're not going to see it at all today. Don't worry. Too quiet? I'm too quiet? Oh no, the game
[524.82s -> 534.68s]  is too quiet. Okay. I'll fix that. Don't worry. That was a one guy moment. Did I get one guide?
[534.68s -> 549.45s]  All right. Here we go. Ready? I'm going in. Okay. Yes, I still have the ice cream cones. I don't have
[549.45s -> 558.17s]  the fucking knuckle controllers. I'm sorry. I can't even hear myself. Grab a vacation pass
[558.17s -> 566.76s]  off the table to get started. Okay. I'm going in. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. It hurt. I was,
[566.76s -> 572.71s]  it was been on the top of my head for too long. Hold on. Dude, imagine if I just like,
[574.31s -> 581.86s]  just fucking bald and the hair is all stuck up here. Just got a haircut for this very purpose.
[584.36s -> 599.45s]  Shit. I forgot to wipe the lenses. Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it. Hold on. Because once you go in
[599.45s -> 607.13s]  here, you can't come out for like 30 minutes. I'm in. All right. Wait, which side was left and
[607.13s -> 620.17s]  right? I don't remember. Can you see? What the fuck? Why isn't it on? Okay. There we go.
[620.81s -> 636.90s]  All right. I'm going in. I'm going in. I'm going to be in. I'm going in. I'm in. Vacation is
[636.90s -> 644.76s]  waiting human. Grab one of those passes. Where's my other hand? In. Where's my other hand?
[645.40s -> 656.58s]  I got two hands. Okay. Human one, human four, human five. Or the, yeah, I could see you. That's
[656.58s -> 664.81s]  me. Insert guest pass. Hello, human. Waiting for guest pass. Try to speak human five. Great.
[664.81s -> 679.75s]  Now put it in the slot and pull the lever. I'm getting plus twoed for that shit.
[681.54s -> 685.70s]  I'm getting plus twoed for crunk. That's bullshit.
[686.50s -> 694.84s]  How are you? Vacation. We should learn how to talk to bots. When you're close,
[694.84s -> 699.00s]  just wait to get a bot's attention. I don't even wear the wrist wraps. I'm a fucking rebel.
[699.88s -> 711.53s]  That's a bad idea. Put those on. Nintendo warned me about that. What the fuck? I'm putting them on.
[711.53s -> 717.16s]  I know. It's been a long time. Give me a minute. The only way to get a bot to talk. Shut up. Try it
[717.16s -> 727.03s]  now. Shut up. Great job. You really nailed the standard human greeting protocol. This is a warm
[727.11s -> 735.99s]  up. This is a warm up. See? I've got a red dot sight. Hey, I would not say anything fucking mean to me.
[738.23s -> 747.59s]  I wasn't listening to any of that.
[758.39s -> 761.83s]  Fuck. Somebody said, somebody called me a fucking loser. Somebody called me short.
[767.50s -> 779.64s]  Oh, fucking NAA. How much ammo do I have? What do you say? Come take the thing out of the, oh,
[779.64s -> 784.01s]  now I'm getting too close. Hold on. What do you say? Get into the bathroom so you can get
[784.01s -> 793.03s]  ready to vacation. Let's go. Every human starts as a blank slate. You can be the you you see in
[793.03s -> 801.43s]  yourself. You're gonna watch me in the bathroom? Where's the toilet? Do I piss into the sand
[801.43s -> 817.40s]  bathtub? This is uh, this, this, this isn't like your grandmother's house. This is to make you
[817.40s -> 835.21s]  not think that you've had or something. Good. All right. Now what? Oh shit. All right. Come on.
[837.34s -> 848.57s]  Okay. Now Jeremy, you're looking for 40 cents. What is this? Makeup? Oh, it's snow. It's skin.
[848.57s -> 863.91s]  Okay. Mr. Greens. I'm sorry. I'm acting like this is the first time I've ever put this on.
[863.99s -> 877.21s]  I'm sorry. It's been a year. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Go back, back, back, back, back, back,
[877.21s -> 884.17s]  back, back. I want to go back. No, I want to go back. I want to go back. I want to go back. I want
[884.17s -> 886.17s]  to go back. I want to go back. I want to go back. I want to go back. I want to go back. I want to be,
[886.17s -> 895.98s]  I want to be a Ninja Turtle. Thank you. Am I in a Don't Tell on mood today?
[896.70s -> 915.40s]  Ah, Leonardo. Any green? Dude, you know, you know what I'm thinking? Why, why, why have they not
[915.40s -> 921.93s]  given a Ninja Turtle a beard? I think that would like really, really do well with like the zoomers,
[921.93s -> 934.44s]  don't you think? Like, like a nice, like clean shaved beard. I don't care about any of this.
[935.16s -> 950.55s]  Would you wear glasses over your VR headset? I don't care. Oh, shit. I don't have, I don't
[950.55s -> 966.70s]  have any hair for that. Oh, that hurts. You guys ever, hey, do you guys ever do this? I do, I do
[966.70s -> 981.45s]  this. I go, everybody does that. Why? Cause it gets, I don't know, it gets a little irritated
[981.45s -> 987.51s]  there. I look, I've seen, I don't know where you are, but I've seen the photo. I've seen the photos
[987.51s -> 992.74s]  of my armpit hair and it kind of freaks me out. So yeah, I got to stay on top of it because people
[992.74s -> 998.50s]  will take like a small clip of me like with my arm up and they'll like zoom in on my fucking armpit
[998.50s -> 1006.26s]  hair. And the only thing that they say is hair, hair, look at hair, hair. And it's like, yeah,
[1006.26s -> 1013.85s]  yeah, yeah, we got hair. Okay. Oh God. What did I just hit? That's not real. I thought I knocked
[1013.85s -> 1017.45s]  something off the table. I thought I knocked something off of my table. That's just a fake
[1017.45s -> 1050.73s]  toothbrush. How do I do this? Oh shit. This is cool. Okay. Brush it up down there. Oh, you do drink
[1050.73s -> 1065.51s]  it. Don't do that. Why would you do that? Why did you drink toothpaste? Don't do this challenge
[1065.59s -> 1066.07s]  video. Okay.
[1079.66s -> 1087.29s]  All right. I think we're good. Can I leave the bathroom? Look crazy.

[1100.92s -> 1132.15s]  I lost an earbud. Hold on. All right. We're in the bath. These bath bombs. Oh, they are.
[1138.38s -> 1151.14s]  Are they bath bombs? Oh, that's dumb. It's rain. What? Oh, nice. Okay.
[1156.42s -> 1170.10s]  Shit. Be careful. Hey, oh, bubble bath. My favorite. Ah, is this even hot?
[1170.74s -> 1175.56s]  Where are the bubbles? This is fucking bullshit. This ain't Elmo bubble bath, the best one.
[1183.38s -> 1214.38s]  I'm going to hit something. Let's make a fucking fire. Okay. I ate it. All right. Oh, that's fun.
[1214.38s -> 1227.00s]  I'm done. Electronics in there. I can't help it. It's VR, dude. Nothing. It's not even real life.
[1227.00s -> 1246.95s]  It's VR. Oh, isn't there a video of a cat doing this under the faucet? Just sitting there and
[1246.95s -> 1263.75s]  just drinking cat like goes, it's like a funny cat video. That was cool. I got this long hair,

[1283.61s -> 1293.61s]  no, no, no. I can't have Twitch TV here. How about this? It's DJ time.
[1313.91s -> 1315.11s]  I forgot how much fun this was.
[1315.19s -> 1321.27s]  Here, take this one of a kind human back storage device. Wow, human, you look really tourist.
[1321.99s -> 1330.15s]  Feel free to continue exploring your suite. There better be a stack of red balls in there.
[1334.81s -> 1338.57s]  God, I like this one. This one's fun. Holy shit. This is a fun game. I like this one. I'm going to
[1338.57s -> 1349.77s]  stay in this one for a while. Kramer. You know what to do? Honky choco. Oh, diet doctor oil.
[1350.57s -> 1386.92s]  Hi, room. Is this somebody else's hotel room? It is. What am I? Don't make like a slam your
[1386.92s -> 1390.36s]  don't. Why would I make a slam your dick in the fridge joke? That's what I do that for.
[1391.08s -> 1395.85s]  I'm just I'm kind of unhinged right now, right? I shouldn't. I'm not going to do that.
[1397.02s -> 1406.74s]  Game's fucking terrible. Delete it. That didn't even break. I like it again. Hot drink pods,
[1406.74s -> 1431.53s]  lemon juice. Is VR so cool? All right. Lemon juice. Okay. Should I call Grover? Oops.
[1440.31s -> 1456.17s]  I just told him to go fuck himself in binary. All right. Where am I? Where am I in the room?
[1456.89s -> 1500.01s]  Blackjack on here. It's not even hard. Game's not even hard. I fucking win again.
[1501.19s -> 1515.05s]  Let's try the computer to go fuck himself in binary. All right. Let's go. This is an ego
[1515.05s -> 1532.01s]  stream. Bod watchers skip. It was the same joke. You can make the same joke within that was a one.
[1532.01s -> 1546.07s]  I guess one minute went by. This was my room. Let me know if you're ready to vacation and remember
[1546.07s -> 1557.74s]  waving is the best way to talk to bots. All right. Where do you guys want to go? Beach,
[1558.46s -> 1565.05s]  the forest or the mountain? No, I'm not. What? Are you ready to go human? You have to wave at me
[1565.05s -> 1570.54s]  if you want to talk in beach, beach, beach, beach, beach. All right. We'll go beach. How do I go?
[1571.34s -> 1579.85s]  Please only scan the hand that has the resort provided wristband for the resort scanner to
[1579.85s -> 1585.21s]  function. You must lateral hand movement also called waving is a convenient way. I need a
[1585.21s -> 1589.77s]  pass. We were ready to vacation, but it looks like all the destinations are closed right now.
[1591.05s -> 1597.42s]  What is this? This wasn't here earlier. Funny. You should ask the bureau of simulations requires
[1597.58s -> 1603.90s]  my goggles are getting steamy. Which you seem to have conveniently forgotten. Luckily,
[1603.90s -> 1612.26s]  I figured out a way to measure vacation, quantified memory management efficiency, but I should have
[1612.26s -> 1617.86s]  known here human take this wristband. It will be your key to unlock efficient. How many viewers
[1617.86s -> 1625.58s]  are here? Oh good. It's okay. There's 7,200 people here. Efficient. Now use it on that scanner over
[1625.58s -> 1635.22s]  there. Access denied. You don't have enough memories. Yes. You need memories to gain access
[1635.22s -> 1647.00s]  to different areas of the resort here. Try this. A memory of the time is how you vacation.
[1647.00s -> 1652.76s]  What did he just say to me? Can he just tell me to go fuck myself? It looks like your wristband
[1652.76s -> 1657.08s]  has enough memories for that scanner. Bring it back for the third time. Bring it back for a third
[1657.08s -> 1668.97s]  time. Accepted. When that vacation is open, you can visit any of our three destinations.
[1668.97s -> 1685.50s]  The beach is the most efficient place to start. Quiet. I want to play that way. Please select.
[1685.50s -> 1689.90s]  The beach is a great place to start your vacation. That's where I want to go. I want to go to the
[1689.90s -> 1700.38s]  beach. Oh, I had to like wave at it. Welcome to Vacation Beach. Humans came to the beach to
[1700.38s -> 1706.62s]  reconnect to the moment they evolved to walk on land. All right, move. I see you're finally
[1706.62s -> 1712.70s]  getting the hang of vacation. Make enough memories and you'll get access to more areas of Vacation
[1712.70s -> 1719.50s]  Island. Cosmo and Wanda, leave me the fuck alone. I'm happy we made it to the beach. The Bureau of
[1719.50s -> 1726.46s]  Simulations won't be... I wish I had no grandparents. Boom. They're gone. Didn't he do that in an
[1726.46s -> 1730.54s]  episode? But I know a way to track the moments you enjoy. And then like the apocalypse happened?
[1730.54s -> 1733.18s]  The camera in your backpack. It happened in one of those. Try it out. It happened, right?
[1738.57s -> 1745.69s]  Just tap the button on the camera to snap a photo. Oh, this is cool. Now this is vacation. Wait,
[1745.69s -> 1749.77s]  am I going to put the backpack? There are plenty of actual memories to be made on the beach.
[1749.77s -> 1756.01s]  But actually, I know that actually happened. Have fun vacationing your way, human.
[1756.01s -> 1763.83s]  Oh, you can do a selfie. We'll see you later. Why are all selfies all the way up like that?
[1763.83s -> 1770.79s]  How come there's no selfies like this? They're all always like that. Why? What does this do? I
[1770.79s -> 1778.02s]  don't understand. Why don't you just do this? I have to go like this? Why? It's too high.
[1778.82s -> 1782.98s]  Explain it to me. Because everybody's ugly and that looks good from up there.
[1783.94s -> 1803.53s]  Well, I guess you can go instead of like this and go see the difference. Yeah, that makes sense.
[1803.53s -> 1809.82s]  Oh, shit. I just took a picture of like my... Stop taking photos. I got it. Put it in the backpack.
[1810.62s -> 1833.30s]  Are you alive? I didn't... I dropped it a little. Oh, no, no. This guy needs some sunscreen. I had...
[1833.30s -> 1840.55s]  This is like GTA, guys. You have to punch the first person you see. How do I travel around?
[1840.55s -> 1868.01s]  Are you using that? Can I... Are you using this? Is this guy dead? Is he... Hey,
[1868.01s -> 1888.78s]  Marley, throw me the ball. Throw me the ball. I'm concerned about this guy. The sun is on,
[1888.78s -> 1903.10s]  the water is wet. Oh, yes. Pass me a ball and then it's game on. Hey, it's a handball.
[1903.10s -> 1908.30s]  Right now what? The rules are simple. Get the ball past me and I'll hand you a point.
[1908.38s -> 1919.22s]  Try to beat my high score, human. That's one. Where am I? Well, how close am I? I don't know
[1919.22s -> 1939.16s]  where I am. Watch this technique, ready? Fuck, never mind. That's it? With more training,
[1939.16s -> 1947.64s]  you can get that high score. Lost. Let's go. I gotta get a good one. Where am I? Perfect time
[1947.64s -> 1957.80s]  for sports. Hey there, human. Toss me something. Oh, it's all hands on and off. I wanna go to the
[1957.80s -> 1984.26s]  dive site next. This is so fun. Okay, give me a ball. I don't know where I am. The shelf. Is it
[1984.26s -> 2002.50s]  the red shelf? Is it okay? Is it all right? It's coming down. Oh, it's like a daria. No,
[2002.50s -> 2019.90s]  that would be this. I need another ball. Move forward. It's falling. That thing back to that
[2019.90s -> 2029.61s]  thing just rushes me. He's got low blood sugar. No, I don't. I've eaten. I'm fine.
[2031.78s -> 2042.62s]  Blood sugar. I need another ball. Burgers are up there. Fuck this game. Oh, yes.
[2042.62s -> 2057.26s]  Oh, what the fuck, dude? Oh, I can dig there. Maybe I'll get a fucking coin.
[2058.71s -> 2073.46s]  That was a plus two. Are you fucking serious? Are you guys kidding me? Are you serious? Really?
[2073.46s -> 2085.38s]  That's an Animal Crossing joke. You guys love that game. Really? Come on, dude. What do I do?
[2085.94s -> 2100.14s]  I just... Who eats a hamburger like this? This is like the police cut off the crust. Okay,
[2100.14s -> 2114.49s]  that was weird. All right. All right. What we got? Beach cheese. What are these? Tortillas?
[2115.21s -> 2117.13s]  I'm on there. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2117.93s -> 2128.12s]  I'm a human. I'm a tall box. I'm a super computer behind machine.
[2128.12s -> 2132.20s]  But I think I'm an animal in the head. Can you help me clear some of these requests?
[2135.86s -> 2155.27s]  Thank God we got it. Okay, well, I need a patty, right? A Minecraft cheese blocker.
[2156.62s -> 2190.87s]  All right. Can I break this down? Can I melt? I got to make my perfect burger. Fuck. Not too
[2190.87s -> 2197.13s]  much. A little bit more. All right. That looks good. No, just no gross ketchup. No gross mustard.
[2204.01s -> 2207.75s]  Come on. Give me that one. Oh shit. I touched it.
[2208.71s -> 2222.66s]  They have any vegetables? How come there's no vegetables?
[2228.14s -> 2263.00s]  This looks like a really shitty cake. Oh, wait a minute. There we go. Come on. Get on there.
[2268.07s -> 2286.41s]  Where's the lettuce? Hey, I'm taking this with me. Guys, it's made out of fondant. Don't worry.
[2299.96s -> 2311.72s]  These redeem at the front desk for 20 tokens. I want to make a hot dog.
[2322.68s -> 2338.44s]  Swiss cheese. That's the best. Let's want it. But you don't act like you guys don't do the same
[2338.44s -> 2353.29s]  thing. Wouldn't do this. Okay. Dog in there. Is it frozen? That's fucking rancid. People do that
[2353.29s -> 2381.58s]  shit, you know. Nice. All right. Good. Little bit of oil. Ketchup. Mustard. Ketchup. Bacon. Right?
[2381.58s -> 2400.84s]  Right. Ketchup. Mustard. Bacon. What's the rest of it? All right. Let's go. That was fun. Oh,
[2400.84s -> 2417.22s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What am I doing? What am I thinking? I'm such an idiot. Where's
[2417.22s -> 2434.34s]  my camera? Okay. Selfie. How am I going to get? Wait. Set it up like this. I got to get this on
[2434.34s -> 2451.51s]  Instagram. I am so glad you're here to help me out. Check out the requests. Ah, got it. Good.
[2452.47s -> 2466.02s]  All right. Get out of my way. It's all right. What is that over there? Nudge me? Sandcastle sandbox?
[2466.90s -> 2472.66s]  Welcome to the sandcastle station, human. You can design your own castle or try to follow the
[2472.66s -> 2480.74s]  blueprints. This is boring. No, I'm bored. Your minigame sucks. You should be more like the grill
[2480.74s -> 2489.37s]  guy up there. That's fun. Cool. And you have, by the way, you have the most expensive stand.
[2490.39s -> 2502.82s]  How many customers? Less than five? How many did the grill guy get up there? Like a hundred? Yeah,
[2502.82s -> 2515.21s]  well, you've got like an LCD screen too. Like this is rude. Missed so much. Missed 50 subs? Karen.
[2516.01s -> 2530.58s]  Minus two. Karen. I'm just, I'm not a Karen. No, I, guys, I have not walked up to the person filming
[2530.58s -> 2537.08s]  and went, what are you doing? What are you filming? Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And they bring up their
[2537.08s -> 2548.15s]  phone. How do you like that? Huh? I haven't done that yet. I haven't done that yet. Who gave the subs
[2551.98s -> 2562.17s]  yet? Was it? It was Freddy Dredd? Thanks, Freddy. Thank you for the 50 subs. Fucking crazy. That's
[2562.57s -> 2570.55s]  so much money. Thank you, Freddy. Hook was upside down. Just uh, hook was upside down.
[2570.55s -> 2575.83s]  I'm going to have a place of business here. Probably have at least a little bit of cleanliness.
[2577.29s -> 2586.38s]  Okay. That side there. Hi. Hello. Hi. Yes, I am a customer waiting to be served. Hey,
[2586.38s -> 2592.30s]  you're my first customer today. Yes. Let's make a memory together. Take a selfie and hand it to me
[2592.30s -> 2598.54s]  so I can frame this moment. And don't forget your camera hovers my human. It will let you strike a
[2598.54s -> 2603.98s]  sweet pose. The bottom right rainbow popsicle, when I press it, it sticks in a little bit.
[2604.94s -> 2609.82s]  I mean, I still got what I ordered. I still got the popsicle, but it sticks in and it's fucking
[2609.82s -> 2614.22s]  annoying. I bring me and my kids come in here all the time and one day they're probably going to get,
[2614.22s -> 2616.70s]  it's going to get stuck and it's going to get stuck too hard. They're not going to get it.
[2617.42s -> 2626.22s]  Oh, you're filming and you're filming. Oh, okay. Hello. Hello everybody. Yes. Filming me.
[2627.43s -> 2634.55s]  Good. Yeah. Good. Oh, well, what do you know? Now I can film you too. Okay. Smile, right?
[2634.55s -> 2655.45s]  Fucking asshole. Fix your fucking machine. I lost my Jaron. Oh, I can't. What happened to my other
[2655.45s -> 2661.91s]  earbud? All right. I want one of these. I'm getting strangled. I'm actually getting strangled right
[2661.91s -> 2667.94s]  now. Fucking vibe. I swear to God, I would, Hey, vibe. Yeah. Let me talk to the vibe manager.
[2668.66s -> 2672.63s]  And I said the earbuds like didn't just slip out every five seconds. You know,
[2672.63s -> 2677.83s]  one of these days it's going to get stuck in there and okay. Taking a selfie. Okay. Okay.
[2677.83s -> 2684.78s]  You enjoy vacation. I got it. Subject. You look amazing. You must be a model. Oh, thanks.
[2685.58s -> 2689.82s]  I want one of those. You're hurting for cash. You can find some sand dollars on the ground
[2689.90s -> 2701.54s]  and shallow water. I want it for free. Oh, no memories. Do you want to help me prove that
[2701.54s -> 2705.70s]  beach vacation has the best moments? Give me a wave and I can tell you more.
[2709.18s -> 2716.22s]  Dive site. The joy of vacation is uncovered with tangible progress. In this case, you need five
[2716.22s -> 2723.70s]  memories to progress to the dive site. I haven't made any memories. What the fuck have I been doing?
[2724.58s -> 2726.82s]  All I've been doing has been making memories.
[2733.59s -> 2748.18s]  What are you talking about? I have to give photos. Look, you're obviously the hands of this operation.
[2748.18s -> 2754.63s]  So can you put the photo on the sketch yourself? Do you want to help me prove that beach vacation
[2754.63s -> 2760.63s]  has the best? Tell me what to do. Give me a wave. How do I do this? Oh, hi there. Are you also on
[2760.63s -> 2767.03s]  vacation? So, well, I'm not here to make assumptions about what sketch you're capturing.
[2767.03s -> 2775.51s]  You're going to have to place your own photo. It's hard to watch his mind going like this.
[2776.47s -> 2783.27s]  Of my sibling bots, the beach is clearly the best vacation. Am I right? And I need your help to
[2783.27s -> 2789.91s]  prove it. If you could take some photos that match these sketches, I can show my siblings I had the
[2789.91s -> 2803.32s]  best vacation. What sketches? Grill. He wants a photo of a grill. What sketches is he talking
[2803.32s -> 2824.57s]  about? Yes. Yes. This looks very photo. Now can you place it on the sketch? Oh, I did it. Now my
[2824.57s -> 2832.41s]  siblings will see how much fun I'm having. By the way, human, you can replace any photo on the stand
[2832.41s -> 2839.29s]  as long as it matches the original sketch. He wants a picture of like a hamburger
[2839.37s -> 2864.26s]  or a hot dog. Does it matter? All right. Let's go get that right now. I wasn't on the grill.
[2864.82s -> 2876.70s]  What the fuck was that? Oh, I'm whole. I thought I was holding it still. They defrosted.
[2877.66s -> 2888.25s]  I don't know. What the hell is this shit? Why is there like an upside down pineapple upside down
[2888.25s -> 2904.23s]  cake? Let's develop these. All right. I got it. That's what he wanted, right? I'm coming.
[2920.15s -> 2926.47s]  The fun of beach vacation inspired you human. Take this memory. Oh shit.
[2930.33s -> 2932.97s]  I need, I need three more memories. Let's go get them. Let's go make them.
[2935.32s -> 2943.29s]  Okay. What kind of memory can I do with you? Sorry. I'm like a dog. All right. What is it? What
[2943.29s -> 2952.47s]  are you doing? Oh my, would you look around? There are so many beach, all of these tiny creatures,
[2952.47s -> 2957.03s]  which would be a kind human and fetch me three different types. They're very shy.
[2957.03s -> 2978.63s]  So move slowly. Creatures. Shoot him out of the air. What is this? It's a manicotti. Here,
[2978.63s -> 2996.49s]  I got found you a manicotti. I want to look at that later. There's a motha boy. Does the butterfly
[2996.49s -> 3010.28s]  come back? Oh my God. I found money. All right. There he is. I got to get that guy. This whole
[3010.28s -> 3013.40s]  time he was sitting there just going like, please don't fucking see me. Please don't fucking see me.
[3013.40s -> 3031.72s]  Please don't fucking see me. Got one. Is he all right? Get him. Help, help, help. Oh, I killed
[3031.72s -> 3062.71s]  him. I almost just fell backwards. How do I eat? Can I, how do I get these? Backpack. Hold on. Hey
[3062.71s -> 3070.82s]  little guy. I'm going to take you to safety. All right. What? How do I give this to her? And this
[3071.70s -> 3085.03s]  vibe headphones, man. Put him on the grill. No, I'm not going to grill him. That's fucked up.
[3085.75s -> 3093.32s]  I need the butterfly. All right. We have to, all right. I'm going to put you back.
[3094.12s -> 3098.04s]  I'm not going to cook him. Why would I do that? Here, sit on this little island.
[3129.26s -> 3153.00s]  He's okay. All right. Oh shit. No, I had to make the friends. Oh my God. Where's that camera?
[3153.80s -> 3157.64s]  Give me the camera. Give me it quickly. Holy shit. This is going to get me a lot of money on
[3157.64s -> 3181.16s]  National Geographic. Oh my God. Wait, I get it. Good. Take a picture of them on the grill. No,
[3181.16s -> 3195.22s]  fuck out of here. We are. How are we? I'm not grilling these two. Look at how cute they are.
[3195.22s -> 3230.28s]  I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that shit. No. What was the actual? Oh yeah. Got one.
[3230.60s -> 3234.60s]  Thank you, human. Two more butterflies will really make my screen.
[3250.47s -> 3258.76s]  Great. One more for my bug report. Okay. All right. One more. Where's the last one?
[3258.76s -> 3288.20s]  I see it right there. Thank you, human. And so my heart is filled and so is this bug report.
[3288.20s -> 3298.78s]  Let's bask in the memory like a butterfly in the sun. Beach bugs. Okay. I got money now.
[3299.50s -> 3305.99s]  All right. I got money. What do you want me to do? Hello, human. I'm still having fun in
[3305.99s -> 3321.98s]  this game. Do you like to do some yoga? What's all over here? Here, human. Please follow me
[3321.98s -> 3332.60s]  to achieve a state of optimal profiting. All right. Now we box. You seem to be out of alignment,
[3332.68s -> 3335.24s]  human. Don't forget to breathe.
[3348.86s -> 3365.64s]  Am I asking too many questions? Inhale. Positive. Exhale. Negative.
[3366.98s -> 3383.24s]  Why do I have to hold them like this? That is very yoga. This is not how you do this.
[3387.74s -> 3394.31s]  Find your inner home page. I don't. Give me my money. I don't want the money for this. I don't
[3394.31s -> 3399.75s]  care about anything. Can you smell your stomach? Your precision algorithm is almost accurate.
[3400.63s -> 3410.33s]  Great job, human. Keep following the optimization procedure. I'm here. I'm going to turn the AC
[3410.33s -> 3417.72s]  down. I might have to take a little quick break after the beach. Yes. Feel the energy going
[3417.72s -> 3430.02s]  through your body. I don't want to do this. I feel like I'm like a monkey. Visualize a calm,
[3430.02s -> 3437.46s]  rolling ocean like this one. So excellent job. I hope your data is no longer compressed.
[3438.10s -> 3444.58s]  Take this memory. It is the essence of your path to relaxation. That's three memories, right?
[3444.58s -> 3459.38s]  Where am I? How close might I be? I need two more memories. Fine. Fine. I'll do it.
[3461.72s -> 3466.01s]  Oh, what the fuck? All right. Let's go. Fine. I'll do it. I'll make a memory.
[3466.01s -> 3477.22s]  Judge me. Where am I? I think you need to take a closer look at the blueprints, human.
[3485.32s -> 3488.04s]  Oh, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Judge it.
[3488.44s -> 3494.76s]  The top is exactly what we're looking for. A front. Now we just need to make the rest match.
[3495.64s -> 3507.88s]  I feel like I'm doing the cup thing that they do in like the competitions where they go like,
[3511.86s -> 3552.97s]  how do people do that shit? Yup. Dodge, please. What? The sides are correct.
[3553.61s -> 3556.09s]  Haven't had a chance to look at the blueprint, human.
[3557.05s -> 3573.85s]  Off to a good start. Your front is correct. How about this? Now you just need to work on the rest.
[3582.52s -> 3629.46s]  This is the front. Right. I need a side. Am I doing wrong? Use the whole board. Turn on the
[3629.46s -> 3656.81s]  grill? Top right. Top right block. What's wrong with it? What's wrong with the top right? Fine.
[3656.81s -> 3679.02s]  Oh my god. He's pretending. His brain. Use the corners. Top right has a side.
[3679.02s -> 3685.74s]  What's going on? Top right. You can't be serious. Oh my god. He's insane.
[3686.38s -> 3697.93s]  Screamer. Fucking laugh. Different block. What? This is what you meant. I thought you meant like
[3697.93s -> 3708.25s]  this thing over here. I thought, okay. They didn't make it clear. You gotta say it top.
[3714.01s -> 3723.35s]  What are you talking about? That's correct. This is incorrect?
[3726.38s -> 3737.53s]  Oh, it's the left side? The left side has to be like that too. They didn't say that. They didn't
[3737.53s -> 3756.95s]  say that. Or shit. Oh god. Fucking damn it. Okay, this is, it's too up. So this front, it's like
[3756.95s -> 3774.04s]  this weird, it's got a thing on it. It's got a lip on it. This one has got, the right side looks
[3774.04s -> 3787.30s]  like this. Okay. And then this is that. And then this side is the front. That shit right there.
[3788.34s -> 3839.72s]  Right side. I know. I'm working on it. Okay. So front, three high. Okay. And right side.
[3842.28s -> 3852.02s]  What? What are you talking about? What's wrong with it? You graduated college? Yeah,
[3852.50s -> 3860.20s]  15 years ago. I haven't sat in a classroom in fucking 16 years. I've been eating cheeses
[3860.84s -> 3867.96s]  and drinking fucking cheese whiz and watching Netflix. I lost it all. I lost all of it. It was
[3867.96s -> 3891.90s]  16 years ago. Little bottom block is solid. I'll take a memory please.
[3891.90s -> 3906.01s]  Nope. Beginner. I'm not, I don't want to do that anymore. That's, that's annoying.
[3906.65s -> 3912.49s]  It's annoying. Yeah. Your game is annoying. You're annoying too. Annoying hat, annoying glasses,
[3912.49s -> 3918.81s]  annoying, annoying fucking wind fury from Hearthstone. What's the guy's name? What's
[3918.81s -> 3928.74s]  the guy's name? The wind fury guy. What's his name? No, no, no, no, no. He goes, that's what
[3928.74s -> 3934.84s]  they didn't say. That's what they didn't say. Like swatting insects. Like swatting insects.
[3934.84s -> 3946.95s]  That's what they didn't say. Alkazir. Alkazir. Alakir. Yes. Thank you. Somebody got it. Somebody
[3946.95s -> 3957.38s]  went to college in here. How many more do I need? Just one more, right? Oh, here we go. I need another
[3957.38s -> 3975.11s]  ball. Hearthstone college. No, when you attack with Alakir, he goes, that's what they didn't
[3975.11s -> 3979.11s]  say. That's what they didn't say. Cause you can go twice. You're never going to un-hear it.
[3980.49s -> 3983.13s]  That's what they did say. I'm telling you. What does he have to do?
[3989.62s -> 4009.50s]  I win. Oh.
[4016.73s -> 4037.46s]  Dive. I can dive now. When is the next iPad stream? Why the fuck do you want an iPad stream?
[4037.46s -> 4052.87s]  Oh, wait. I hope you like our machine serve vending product. Oh,
[4056.87s -> 4062.95s]  put it down. Oh, okay. I'm all right. That just like, that just triggered like a response from me.
[4068.25s -> 4077.35s]  What happened to my ears? Dude, biting like directly into a fucking ice cream like that
[4077.35s -> 4100.57s]  with like just, Oh, wait a minute. I hope you had an excellent time vending on vacation.
[4100.57s -> 4105.61s]  Humans use selfie as their primary method of communication. I'm that annoying guy with the
[4105.61s -> 4111.05s]  bottle of Sriracha that takes a bite and fucking puts a line down and takes a bite and puts a line
[4111.05s -> 4116.89s]  down and takes like, dude, fucking put it down, put it down. That stuff's gross. Don't do that.
[4116.89s -> 4127.21s]  Come on, man. Don't do that. Why are you that guy? Yes, I don't like Sriracha. I don't think it's
[4127.21s -> 4134.87s]  gross. I'll address you directly. I think Sriracha is gross. I think it just does. I think it just
[4134.87s -> 4143.00s]  tastes sour and like it smells to me. All right. Did I just lose like a thousand viewers? Maybe.
[4143.00s -> 4146.04s]  I don't know. I just personally don't like it. I know people that love it, but that's great.
[4147.96s -> 4154.54s]  I'm a Tabasco guy. I know I just made, okay. I just pissed off a lot of people. That's fine.
[4154.54s -> 4162.28s]  I'm a green Tabasco guy or a Tabasco reserve guy. Let me address you directly.
[4171.86s -> 4183.94s]  Oh my God. I'm so excited. Thanks. I had fun at the daycare.
[4187.24s -> 4188.04s]  Oh shit.
[4217.85s -> 4233.11s]  Enjoy your dive, human. Okay. Looking for 40 cents. Rehash. That's a fucking rehash.
[4233.11s -> 4259.35s]  Oh, that was pretty cool. Hey, get away. You're going to propel it out. Grab a lens?
[4260.63s -> 4272.44s]  Did you die by eating these? You die. You can die if you eat this, right? Aren't there like
[4272.44s -> 4275.96s]  four chefs in all of the world that can actually make it so you don't die if you eat that? Why
[4275.96s -> 4280.76s]  would you want to eat that? Come down here to see the sunken ship, but I'm more interested in
[4280.76s -> 4289.19s]  marine life. Poisonous. But there are aquatic creatures down here unlike anything. These photos
[4289.19s -> 4296.06s]  of the more unique citizens of the sea. So I may add them to my collection. Hello photo lens.
[4296.78s -> 4314.66s]  I'm fucking realistic. I'll take these to my backpack. I'm sorry guys. Anything that has
[4314.66s -> 4321.02s]  like a, like an 8% chance to kill me if I eat it. Uh, you know, it doesn't have that,
[4321.02s -> 4325.98s]  a toaster strudel. Just eat it. Well, why, why try to like hurt yourself to like eat like a rare
[4325.98s -> 4358.06s]  fish? I should probably move around. Fish eye lens. Oh, cool. All right, let's move.
[4358.06s -> 4366.42s]  Oh, the hole. Do not disturb. Please be nice.
[4405.54s -> 4438.42s]  That was the end of Yoshi, Nintendo 64. I will take the applause now. It's fucking up.
[4442.20s -> 4519.03s]  What's the chopsticks? Hit detection sucks. Whoa. Shut up. Oh, I can get the picture of the, uh,
[4519.11s -> 4531.53s]  I can picture the, the, the, I don't know, the, uh, the ink octopus thing. Ink, um,
[4531.53s -> 4546.65s]  octopus. Giant King. Oh, I love shit like the guys. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen,
[4546.65s -> 4555.27s]  listen, listen to me. The room as a VR game. If you don't think that I'm going to play that
[4555.99s -> 4567.96s]  all fucking day, one of these days of room VR, I cannot wait. I can't fucking wait. All right.
[4567.96s -> 4603.32s]  How do I open it? It's a minfo. Oh wait, there's other keys here. All right. I got three keys.
[4622.87s -> 4627.83s]  The AC is on right now. It's blowing right on my head. Holy shit. This feels phenomenal.
[4641.19s -> 4659.38s]  Long John Silver really, uh, didn't spend very much time on that one.
[4659.38s -> 4683.88s]  This looks the way that a hundred gecks sounds. Oh, I want that. Oh wait, I have,
[4683.88s -> 4698.02s]  I can get memories. Watch this. Oh no, no, no. I want the backpack. Stay there. Stay there. Okay.
[4698.02s -> 4711.11s]  Hold on. How do I take, how do you take the picture? How do I make it do a timer?
[4729.54s -> 4773.53s]  Is it on? It kind of feels normal. I didn't get a memory for this. No, no, no, no, no. I wasn't
[4773.53s -> 4783.80s]  done down there. Oh no. He doesn't have a show. Wait, pirate. Oh, being fishermen. Stack them.
[4783.80s -> 4793.67s]  All right. I want to go. I'm wait. How long have I been in here for? I need to come out for a second.
[4793.67s -> 4803.62s]  Don't I? I need to take like a break. Don't I? I've been, I've been in there for an hour and 20
[4803.62s -> 4832.70s]  minutes. Holy shit. I haven't had a ton of fun. Wait, is it, how do I look? Do I have the lines?
[4832.70s -> 4846.92s]  Okay. I don't really have the lines. This is fucking fun. I forgot how fun this was. All right.
[4846.92s -> 4863.38s]  Let's do a hair check. This looks, this looks deliberately styled like this. It does not,
[4863.38s -> 4877.19s]  it looks better than before. TikTok hair. Oh, I think I lost my audio. Hold on. What is TikTok
[4877.19s -> 4906.66s]  hair supposed to mean? Hold on. E-boy. What the fuck is an E-boy? Ew. Wait, there's so much sweat
[4906.66s -> 4923.51s]  in here. Did the audio get dropped? How come I can't hear anything anymore? Can't hear anything.
[4923.51s -> 4931.34s]  We're in. Are we in? Good though. Yeah, we're good. All right. Let me put these back in and then
[4932.22s -> 4934.94s]  the headphones back in. Yeah, I wasn't getting audio when the headphones were in either.
[4937.38s -> 4946.58s]  Right. Oh, there we go. Mine is too gross. Wait, is it a joke if I have like a sweaty body?
[4946.58s -> 4950.66s]  Why? Do you think I just dumped water on myself and walked in here like, hey, look at, I'm so
[4950.66s -> 4968.92s]  gross. Isn't that a funny thing? Okay, here we go. Let's go. I'm ready to continue my vacation.
[4971.18s -> 4975.26s]  By the way, this, this one is way more fun than the first one. The first one was not even that
[4975.26s -> 4991.27s]  fun. This one's 10 times better. All right. I want to go back here. Why is that rude? That's
[4991.75s -> 5010.78s]  not rude. That's me being real. All right. What else could I, wait, what's this? I won. I got it.
[5014.58s -> 5039.14s]  Come on, I gotta get the one up. Come on. Come on, do it. Come on, I gotta get 10 likes.
[5039.14s -> 5060.33s]  There's nothing else for me to do down here. Okay, let's go. Let's do a new vacation.
[5060.89s -> 5066.15s]  I have a very new vacation. What was the other one? Somebody said, people said go to the forest.
[5066.79s -> 5080.94s]  Look, the puffer fish and me in VR. I think I probably actually could if I really wanted to.
[5081.50s -> 5087.56s]  I think I could probably do it. It would take me a minute. All right, new vacation.
[5092.39s -> 5095.91s]  All right, forest or I don't, I don't even know the forest or mountain.
[5095.91s -> 5100.39s]  The metrics are concerning. I came here to help, but I'm not seeing the upward trend. I was
[5100.39s -> 5108.71s]  expecting. I know it looks bad, but he has Funko pops. Well, if the metrics cross zero,
[5108.71s -> 5113.67s]  the Bureau of Simulation automatically shut down the vacation simulator. Oh,
[5113.67s -> 5123.62s]  we're still far away from zero. Which one? Human. I set up this board to help you visualize your
[5123.62s -> 5129.98s]  memory progress. This is going to help you optimize your vacation. All right, we're going
[5129.98s -> 5142.31s]  mountain. Welcome to snow. The only way you're going to reach peak performance is by collecting
[5142.31s -> 5147.35s]  more memories. Human. Remember, we don't need to be so focused on the goal. We can still have a
[5147.35s -> 5153.03s]  ton of fun getting there. Let me play. There is so much to do. I can't wait for you to see the
[5153.67s -> 5157.83s]  great idea. Oh, the overlook. Okay. Even more memories up there. Oh,
[5159.11s -> 5167.93s]  an even more space seat on jet blue. I already don't want to do this one.
[5169.14s -> 5176.02s]  I already don't want to do this. I know what it is. Yeah. You can shape this ice to your artistic
[5176.02s -> 5184.26s]  vision. The sculpture is already there. It's up to you to chip it out according to this blueprint.
[5185.50s -> 5192.22s]  All right. I actually, this one's cool. Right. The front row.
[5197.02s -> 5229.32s]  Right side is one. Let's start here. This is the right side. Okay. One front row has four. Four.
[5229.32s -> 5267.08s]  Right. Okay. Right side is one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four,
[5267.08s -> 5281.61s]  and then one, two. Okay. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One,
[5281.61s -> 5313.83s]  two, three, four. Four. Your creativity shows no boundaries, human. It's a great start. There are
[5313.83s -> 5320.39s]  many more opportunities to show your skills. All right. Keep going. Right side. All right. Front.
[5320.63s -> 5338.54s]  Oh, no. Bye. Thank you. Puzzle maker. Insert photo. Oh, we get to make up.
[5339.26s -> 5350.89s]  Oh my god. This is perfect. Do the edges first.
[5356.54s -> 5373.37s]  Oh, oh my god. Puzzles. Right. Okay. Come on, man. How do I get them back? All right. We're
[5373.37s -> 5432.78s]  going to do the edges first. Oh, fuck. It's upside down. Um, I look at this. How do I restart it?
[5432.78s -> 5438.25s]  I hope you love putting all the right pieces together as much as I do. Let me do.
[5447.24s -> 5479.74s]  All right. Don't put it. We're going to start with face. Okay. That's good, right? Okay, man.
[5479.74s -> 5488.73s]  Relax. What? I'm actually pretty relaxed right now. Oh, because I said fucker. I'm not allowed
[5488.73s -> 5512.31s]  to swear. How does that look wrong? All right. That's like the chest hair. That's like a chest
[5512.31s -> 5564.79s]  kind of. Okay. Okay. What's the rest of the face? Relax. Relax. Where is it? There. Got it. Part of
[5564.79s -> 5584.04s]  the relax. We'll need a couple more pieces of the face. Nice. I'm getting there. Part of relax.
[5585.37s -> 5593.14s]  Part of face and relax. Switch it around, please. Are you puzzled, human? Good. If you want a new
[5593.14s -> 5610.82s]  puzzle, just put a picture in that machine. That's the other way. It's wrong. Stop doing that.
[5623.78s -> 5679.67s]  Know where it goes. Come on, dude. It's hard to see. Smooth brain. It's not smooth brain.
[5683.67s -> 5690.63s]  It's kind of blurry for me. You guys have the high definition view. I have the low definition
[5690.63s -> 5706.98s]  view. I got both eyes at low depth. You got one eye at high depth. Oh, cool. This looks fun.
[5707.94s -> 5713.14s]  This is my dream game. This is a bunch of random things that take like 20 seconds to do and then
[5713.14s -> 5736.30s]  you just move on to the next thing. Hatch item here. Pirate hat pattern. This is like electricity.
[5746.22s -> 5759.70s]  That was dumb. That one's not even fun. Oh, we got another funny food machine. Oh, my goodness.
[5759.70s -> 5765.35s]  This is the best. When it has a funny food machine, it's the best. Okay. What do I want to do?
[5770.23s -> 5777.11s]  Human, some bots have requests for very specific orders. I'm operating on a higher level than
[5777.11s -> 5783.83s]  simple input output, so I'm just not going to do that. If you want to help, the next order
[5783.83s -> 5791.03s]  is over on the board. Or don't. It's not your job. It doesn't tell me what it is. It won't be my job
[5791.11s -> 5821.74s]  either. Hey, what it is? It just says question mark. Apple mayonnaise pie. It's done.
[5823.82s -> 5827.82s]  It looks pretty good. Looks kind of accurate, actually. Let's test it.
[5830.74s -> 5838.98s]  Paper mache. Wait, that was the order book. That was the ingredients book. I think I...
[5839.54s -> 5852.41s]  Can I get another one? Children's game. Oh, dude, look at this. Oh, don't drop it. That's
[5852.41s -> 5873.02s]  in the beginning of that movie. Oh, with Orson Welles. Honey thermal paste. I don't... I'm going
[5873.02s -> 5882.68s]  to make an apple pie. I'm going to serve it to somebody, I guess. Not a tomato, right? Apple,
[5886.49s -> 5908.01s]  cream. Won't be needing that. Say cream and apple. Okay, got... Now, where's my tray?
[5915.02s -> 5924.14s]  Apple and cream. I'm just making every order at Starbucks. Yeah, I'll take like a spit of coffee
[5924.14s -> 5928.46s]  and then a bunch of like sugar, cream, milk, flavoring, caramel sauce and chocolate syrup
[5928.46s -> 5963.43s]  and raspberry sauce. Okay. What do I do with it? Do I have like a... I don't... I'm a hands-off
[5963.43s -> 5969.85s]  partner in this kitchen. You have hands. So by definition, you should deliver the bot's order.
[5969.85s -> 5978.01s]  Oh, he ordered it. Okay. Hey, I got your order. Who ordered the easy cheese in between... Whatever
[5978.01s -> 5984.01s]  it is. Oh, I'll get that for you, sir. It looks like you dropped it. Oh, let me... I'll fix that
[5984.01s -> 6012.58s]  for you right away. Don't worry. I'm working on it. Okay. Here it is. What are you doing in here?
[6012.58s -> 6020.89s]  It's pretty good. Whatever. I don't think we're going to be able to warm the console up by hands.
[6020.89s -> 6026.66s]  Have you ever found something like that? Ice is nice in winter. Ice is also nice in drinks.
[6026.66s -> 6032.42s]  Ice skis are not nice. Oh, yes. Snow is great. I love snow so very much. Oh, avalanche. These are
[6032.42s -> 6039.70s]  poems. Okay. Skiing. Skiing is so rad. Wooshing on the snow so fast. Wish I had feet, though.
[6040.92s -> 6051.75s]  Ice again. It's cold and it's wet. If only I had some salt. Oh, no. My book froze. What is poems?
[6051.75s -> 6078.15s]  Yeah. Eat. Oh, no. Hurry. Okay. Take it out. Take it out. Take it out. Take it out. I want it. One
[6078.15s -> 6119.46s]  second. One second. One second. Oh. Come here. Come on. Wasn't he a pie? You know, what do I do?
[6119.46s -> 6131.11s]  He needs water. He needs water. He needs water. Water. Water. Water. Water. Oh, God. I'll save
[6131.11s -> 6147.24s]  you. I need water. I need water. I need water right now. Everybody got water? He needs water.
[6147.24s -> 6158.34s]  Wait. Wait a minute. No, I don't have any mayonnaise. Wait a minute. He's drinking to it.
[6159.46s -> 6187.91s]  I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I lost my earbud. Don't worry, little guy. I got you.
[6191.85s -> 6198.71s]  Red. Wait. He liked it. He liked it. Oh, yeah. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. I brought it back to life.
[6198.71s -> 6206.38s]  Okay. Wait. Ice tea. He probably likes it. This is water, right? Okay. This is water. This counts as
[6206.38s -> 6227.38s]  water. I wonder if I can get bigger. What the hell is going on? Yeah, he's... Wait, he'll give me some
[6227.38s -> 6273.10s]  soy milk. Eat as much as you want. Are you good? I don't know where I am in the room. I don't know
[6273.10s -> 6275.66s]  where I am in the room. I don't know where I am in the room. I don't know where I am in the room.
[6275.66s -> 6297.94s]  Did he just kiss me? What? This is fucking stupid. Is he upside down? I don't even know
[6297.94s -> 6303.50s]  which way is upside down or not. Well, I was supposed to make a cake or something.
[6303.50s -> 6313.11s]  What do I do with him? He's just eating the... Okay. You'll be fine in there. Just eat.
[6313.83s -> 6338.52s]  You want cheese and shit too? You want meat? Oh. How do I make a fucking cake?
[6339.32s -> 6363.99s]  Oh, flour, eggs. Yeah, but I don't have a bowl. Wait, what am I supposed to make it in a mug?
[6365.27s -> 6408.90s]  I need a tray. One egg. Oh, it's a quiche. I actually don't have a tray though. Where's he?
[6408.98s -> 6427.35s]  For me? Thank you. Got it. Got it. Where's the other guy? Okay. You mountain bot with a guy
[6427.35s -> 6432.23s]  with the shades wants something from the... I've got to hand it to you, human. Actually, you've
[6432.23s -> 6437.59s]  got to hand it to bot. All right. Fucking squash. As in the order. Make it snappy. A, I don't know.
[6437.59s -> 6452.42s]  Broccoli, lemon juice, carrot, eggs. A little bit of cheese. A couple of eggs. YouTube video.
[6452.42s -> 6457.06s]  We're making a YouTuber video. This is what we call a YouTuber special, guys.
[6457.86s -> 6492.07s]  This is the YouTuber special. Think about your wacky fucking gross stuff. Wait, where is he?
[6493.43s -> 6506.68s]  Nice hot beverage for the mountain guy. Where's he up there? Hey, bottoms up. For me? I'll take it.
[6507.56s -> 6533.10s]  Come on. I can't. Oh, no. I'll get these off. Aquafizz. This machine will accept any official
[6533.10s -> 6542.07s]  snowflakes. I think I've seen some lying around in the mountain. Okay. Me and my friend are going to
[6542.07s -> 6550.90s]  do this. Fine. Put you in the backpack. Oh shit. He can go on the... Nice. All right. Cool.
[6551.62s -> 6561.13s]  Humble snow bot. Whatever. I don't care. What is this? Do not throw snow. What was that? What was
[6561.13s -> 6636.81s]  that? Oh. What are you doing? Doing a thing you're saying not to do. God damn it. Give it to me. I
[6636.81s -> 6690.92s]  want to do one cool thing. Fuck you, game. I fucking... Hey.
[6699.48s -> 6730.79s]  Here. You should probably take this memory too. That guy. Oh my God. Why can I hit this guy?
[6731.75s -> 6754.62s]  I went right through his body. Give me the fucking memory.
[6755.26s -> 6774.76s]  Or it's time for bed. It's not time for bed. What memories do I have? I still got to figure
[6774.76s -> 6780.44s]  out this thing. Wow. Congratulations. I'm too busy working on a soon to be award winning screenplay
[6780.44s -> 6787.56s]  to care. But there are more orders if that's your thing. Oh. How many is that?
[6788.36s -> 6801.03s]  I got to... I know what to do. I need a hot drink. I need a hot drink so I can put it on. Yeah. I
[6801.03s -> 6830.38s]  got it. Right? Okay. Hot drink. Thermal paste. Let's go. See how hot this is?
[6830.38s -> 6846.25s]  That was exhilarating. I am ready to vent for many minutes. Oh look. But I think it's going to be
[6846.25s -> 6851.85s]  worth your time. Yes. I haven't had a grip since anyone came by the hot tub and I couldn't motivate
[6851.85s -> 6857.29s]  myself to turn the heat back on. I've always been a social bot but I guess nobody wants to chat.
[6857.29s -> 6863.13s]  Thanks again for starting the heat back up. Bubbles? Sometimes you gotta get in and fix a problem,
[6863.13s -> 6866.89s]  you know? Get this out of here. I don't want this. The other day I found a bunch of dust and
[6866.89s -> 6872.97s]  fragments. I wasn't really sure what to do. But my buddy swears that a can of compressed air is the
[6872.97s -> 6878.01s]  way to go. I wasn't really sure what to do. What the fuck did I just happen? What happened? What
[6878.01s -> 6882.65s]  happened to this? So I just shook it in as deep as I could go and waved it around for a while.
[6883.21s -> 6889.61s]  I think it ended up blasting my processor fan with the air. But the straw definitely
[6889.61s -> 6895.61s]  knocked some dust out. Don't think that was a good idea. Electrocute this person. Stop it. Stop talking.
[6895.61s -> 6903.13s]  Yeah. Maybe not. Speaking of batteries. Why am I even in a hot tub? I could blow a circuit or
[6903.13s -> 6909.08s]  something. And I'm not exactly. I guess the tub has probably done a better job cleaning my vents
[6909.08s -> 6914.76s]  than the dust remover. Get in there! Nothing like a good soap to get all the gunky bits out.
[6916.44s -> 6920.92s]  Speaking of gunky bits. I saw efficiency bot hovering around here a while ago.
[6920.92s -> 6926.47s]  That broke some of the wrong way. Said something about bad metrics in my area. Not allowing you to
[6926.47s -> 6933.19s]  tell a human. I checked all my areas and I didn't find any metrics, good or bad. Do you know anything
[6933.19s -> 6938.71s]  about metrics, human? Did I get my memory from you? Very annoying. Yeah, me neither. I'm rarely asked
[6938.71s -> 6942.95s]  to measure anything besides when barista bot asked me to stay at least 10 feet away.
[6943.59s -> 6948.87s]  That's a pretty weird metric, given that a foot is an imperial unit and not a metric one. If they'd
[6948.87s -> 6954.31s]  ask me to stay three meters away, I think it would have been more concise. Not sure why they asked me
[6954.31s -> 6961.99s]  to stay away. It's not like I'm leaving this hot tub anytime soon. Like, um, oh yeah, cool. Catch you later, muleman.
[6961.99s -> 6967.82s]  Spit of coffee. How many memories do I have? Can I go to the overlook?
[6969.77s -> 7011.42s]  Let's go. Enough, right? You need to pay close attention to the sketches.
[7011.42s -> 7018.76s]  This photo isn't what I need. Carrot. Oh, he needs a carrot, a hat, and glasses.
[7039.53s -> 7068.79s]  No, don't eat it. Refresh. Give him like a big banana nose. He needs a hat too.
[7069.35s -> 7077.74s]  Okay, we're gonna give him like eyes. Here comes a penis joke.
[7078.70s -> 7090.55s]  Hey, do you think I'm gonna put the banana like where his dick is supposed to be?
[7091.11s -> 7099.05s]  Is that what you think I'm gonna do? Why else would you take the banana? Right? Okay, yeah, yeah,
[7099.05s -> 7105.13s]  do some detective work. Sure, sure, fine. Why else, why else would this guy take the banana?
[7106.01s -> 7112.17s]  Is there any other reason for that? I mean, very obviously it doesn't go there. So why would he
[7112.17s -> 7116.18s]  pick it? What does he think he's gonna do? You think you're gonna get like content by like putting
[7116.18s -> 7128.79s]  a banana dick on this guy? Let's find out. If you can't, you can't. Okay, let's go. Or content.
[7133.22s -> 7139.22s]  That's like, okay, anytime that you would go around your neighborhood and they would be
[7140.10s -> 7145.54s]  like a snowman, how many times did you guys go back like a couple hours later and the
[7145.54s -> 7150.02s]  nose was down there and the two eyes were down there too? How many times? Be honest with me.
[7150.82s -> 7163.40s]  Like it happened to every single time. What do you mean never? Are you serious? You've never
[7163.40s -> 7176.01s]  like seen somebody like move it? Did you ever do that? I didn't do it. 50s memories.
[7176.89s -> 7185.18s]  Oh, the only difference here is the snow is not wicked fucking dirty. You build a snowman like
[7185.18s -> 7192.97s]  this, there's dirt and mud and it kind of smells. It like stinks. And it's like, you don't even want
[7192.97s -> 7201.77s]  to touch it. You gotta wash your hands if you touch it. Yeah. And then, you know, like, okay,
[7201.77s -> 7206.65s]  you ever like take a piece of the snowman, it's like dirty, like head or like dirty gross, like
[7206.65s -> 7212.97s]  snow and you eat it and you just taste dirt. I know for a fact that a ton of you guys have done that
[7212.97s -> 7218.15s]  when you were a little kid. You didn't go like this when the snowman was built. You didn't go,
[7222.07s -> 7228.30s]  crunchy sand dirt, like dance sand and dirt. You know, you didn't think that was like funny
[7228.30s -> 7235.62s]  when you were a little kid. I don't believe any of you. I really don't. I don't believe a single
[7235.62s -> 7248.15s]  one of you. All right. So he needs a hat. You have mine. That's it. And glasses. Get a photo.
[7248.15s -> 7278.46s]  Perfect. Wait, his hands. Hey, hypers. And what was the other one? Just a selfie, right? Selfie
[7278.46s -> 7298.95s]  with what? With mittens on. Oh, mittens. He's a great thing about the mountains, human.
[7299.03s -> 7310.70s]  You can't get two minutes to get a selfie and then we can go to the overlook and Pokemon sound.
[7310.70s -> 7320.62s]  I heard a Pokemon sound. I can't. My voice is a little gone. Okay. Top of the morning to you,
[7320.62s -> 7327.42s]  human. This is the coolest you can get on vacation island. So settle in and get your chill on.
[7333.14s -> 7337.06s]  Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack. Why is everybody saying Jack?
[7340.46s -> 7361.30s]  Who's where? That was Jacksepticeye? What? What was it? Hey, human. Have you heard the legend of
[7361.30s -> 7367.22s]  abominable snow bot? It is said to be an elusive bot that roams these very mountains.
[7367.94s -> 7373.30s]  The few people who claim to have seen it say that it is very shy but has a special fondness for
[7373.30s -> 7385.98s]  music. I thought I saw it once. Jackson. Jackson's a good dude. What are you talking about? Wait, no,
[7385.98s -> 7407.40s]  no, no. Go back, back, back, back. I got it. That was a bad impression. Was it? That was, I just,
[7408.44s -> 7422.74s]  was it a bad impression? He's got so much energy. It was good. I thought it was all right.
[7424.02s -> 7426.78s]  I mean, there's only one Jacksepticeye. It can't be me.
[7428.94s -> 7434.22s]  Way to rock that classic winter look, human. Yeah, tell somebody to do an impression of me.
[7434.54s -> 7441.26s]  Fantastic start to proving my role as the unique sibling. I've got a unique voice. You can't do me.
[7461.64s -> 7464.28s]  Leave me the fuck alone. I don't want to talk to any of you.
[7465.08s -> 7474.28s]  I want to go to the overlook is what I want to do. Vacation bot tells me
[7474.28s -> 7480.52s]  gondolas were the human's most efficient way to climb mountains. Enjoy. Yay. Great job, human.
[7480.52s -> 7485.32s]  We're on our way to see the rest of the mountain. Get on this gondola and throw that switch.
[7486.12s -> 7499.54s]  VR games suck, lol. Oh, no, they don't. They're fucking fun.
[7506.98s -> 7512.38s]  Oh, I just leave. Welcome to the overlook, human.
[7512.94s -> 7519.42s]  We're really high up, but the sun is even higher. Just remember, it's about the journey.
[7519.98s -> 7529.11s]  What do I want? Okay, we've got vanilla, mint chocolate chip, chocolate, strawberry fruit,
[7529.83s -> 7541.85s]  orange cream, vanilla bean, rocky road. No. You know, I'm going to do three scoops.
[7542.41s -> 7592.71s]  How do I turn the stream off? How do I turn the stream off right now? Wow, there's a maximum.
[7593.51s -> 7615.96s]  There's a maximum. All right, let's go. What is that? Ronald McDonald's skis.
[7615.96s -> 7622.63s]  Oops, I just punched everybody in the face.
[7633.66s -> 7634.94s]  Avoid the obstacles.
[7660.36s -> 7673.75s]  Thousand points. One thousand.
[7735.24s -> 7742.12s]  But now I can. Get it? It was you. A score like that deserves a pack.
[7742.12s -> 7745.32s]  All right, let's go to the other. One more place to go to. And then this whole stream
[7745.32s -> 7760.28s]  has been vacation simulator. Why? I can't stop. You're addicted to this.
[7761.24s -> 7773.42s]  What about the memory? Ladder to the peak. What the fuck just happened? Current height?
[7774.94s -> 7777.82s]  Distance. First memory. I don't get it. Is this like Tetris?
[7803.90s -> 7814.71s]  Rock climbing. Oh, I thought it was like Tetris. It sounds like you had quite the climb.
[7814.71s -> 7817.83s]  It would have been much more efficient if we had just installed an elevator.
[7817.83s -> 7820.47s]  It's not really an accomplishment if you just skip to the end.
[7821.11s -> 7823.83s]  Anyway, no peak is complete until you fly your flag.
[7823.83s -> 7825.91s]  Oh, the flag. Go ahead and turn that tank
[7825.91s -> 7836.34s]  to raise up the flagpole. Is that testament to human achievement?
[7836.34s -> 7840.14s]  Up high. All right, what is it? What's our flag?
[7841.02s -> 7855.19s]  Hey there. Okay, we did it. Now what?
[7855.19s -> 7860.49s]  Now what? We did it. We climbed the highest peak on Vacation Island
[7860.49s -> 7865.45s]  and flew the flag to prove it. This is so much more exhilarating than a memory.
[7865.45s -> 7869.93s]  This doesn't make any sense. By all accounts, the human is doing great at vacation.
[7869.93s -> 7876.73s]  Why are the metrics getting worse? No, that can't be. This vacation is going so well.
[7877.37s -> 7879.93s]  Experiences are abstract, but metrics aren't.
[7879.93s -> 7883.69s]  The Bureau of Simulations could shut us down if the numbers drop low enough.
[7883.69s -> 7886.97s]  I'm going to spend a few cycles figuring out what's happening.
[7886.97s -> 7890.81s]  Is it going to turn into like a scary game? Well, I guess Efficiency Bot is busy crunching
[7890.81s -> 7894.65s]  the numbers. We'll wait here for them to come back so we can talk.
[7894.65s -> 7897.13s]  You can use that path to get back to Mountain Shop, human.
[7897.13s -> 7918.33s]  It's Aurora Borealis. We're going to achieve it at this time of day.
[7918.33s -> 7923.13s]  All right, we got Forest. This is lore here, but I'm on vacation. I don't care.
[7924.25s -> 7927.13s]  I don't want to be burdened with the lore when I'm trying to relax.
[7933.53s -> 7935.53s]  Painting? There's painting up there.
[7944.09s -> 7948.73s]  Next game, President Sleeper. Hold on, I like this.
[7948.73s -> 7952.73s]  We're just vacationing your way. We'll lead you to it.
[7952.73s -> 7954.81s]  I love the little mini games. They're so much fun.
[7959.21s -> 8002.01s]  Holy shit, this is cool. Look at that back. Oh, a photo. Oh, wow. Look at you. Why don't we?
[8002.01s -> 8042.95s]  Hey, that's fun. Wait, it's you want it to be. You want green at the top and the whole.
[8042.95s -> 8068.34s]  This is green. I'm going to say one, two, three. Oh, fuck. Wrong.
[8068.34s -> 8073.34s]  Oh, hello there, human. Would you like to discover the digital canvas with me?
[8075.02s -> 8077.74s]  I'd like you to paint me a little painting. That's what I'm doing.
[8077.74s -> 8079.34s]  Anything your heart desires.
[8080.22s -> 8122.73s]  I'm painting the thing that you want. Pink, orange. This is so relaxing.
[8131.22s -> 8148.49s]  Light blue. Painting is fucking stupid. Why would you want this? OK, then this blue,
[8150.15s -> 8213.74s]  right? Then yellow. Come on, get it. OK, now yellow. That's it. That's not what he wanted.
[8213.74s -> 8226.82s]  He wanted this is a happy color palette. Fantastic, human. I feel the energy of this
[8226.82s -> 8233.06s]  work. It truly represents narcolepsy. I could have just given him like a line across the
[8233.06s -> 8237.14s]  canvas. The bots on the board would love to commission you to make them a painting.
[8238.26s -> 8252.71s]  OK, sure. I know exactly what I'm going to paint. Let's see if I get it. See if I get it from
[8252.71s -> 8294.46s]  memory. Let's see if I get it from memory. I'm not going to look. Hey, that's one. There he is.
[8294.46s -> 8353.91s]  Backpack. OK, now, um, fireman. Hey, fireman. Let's do fireman.
[8353.91s -> 8401.51s]  Oh, his eyes are a little closer. No, it's not, right? All right. All right. Let's do one more.
[8401.51s -> 8432.39s]  OK, I'll try. I'll do the rat. I'll do the rat face. I'll do the mucker rat. Hey, what? Oh, shit.
[8463.75s -> 8561.61s]  What else? Oh, it's the ear. Right. I fucked a zero. Here, you can have that one. It looks
[8561.61s -> 8566.25s]  like you could enrich the lives of some other bots with your art. Why don't you give this one
[8566.25s -> 8569.69s]  to one of the bots on this board? Oh, wait, I could do that. I'll do a gerbil heart too.
[8570.65s -> 8658.15s]  It goes off screen. OK, and then let's go. I got a photo for you. Hey, have a fireman.
[8658.15s -> 8662.79s]  That's going to be worth some money some day. Thank you, human. Now I can finally teach my bots.
[8662.79s -> 8667.99s]  Denial. I bet that bot Moss has more for you to do. Be sure to say hi for me.
[8668.71s -> 8677.02s]  Oh, what's going on in this tent? OK, we got smores. Hey, hey, let me directly address you.
[8677.10s -> 8701.40s]  Where am I? Of course, this is going to be sick. Hey, and you do, where's the, how do you turn this
[8701.40s -> 8709.80s]  on? Wow, a real campfire. Look at that. Let me know when you're ready for a spooky story. No, no, no,
[8709.80s -> 8712.28s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is wrong.
[8712.92s -> 8722.57s]  This is wrong. That's all right. This is how you make a smore, guys. Don't tell anyone. This is the
[8722.57s -> 8726.17s]  actually correct way to do this. If you do it another way, it's wrong.
[8729.86s -> 8737.91s]  Chocolate, double chocolate. Very important. Get the other graham cracker ready. Have your
[8738.87s -> 8742.71s]  thing with the marshmallow on it. Roast the marshmallow. Don't put, don't do anything with
[8742.71s -> 8756.94s]  this. Slowly. OK, there you go. Grab this shit. Squeeze it right there. Pull it back. Squish,
[8757.58s -> 8764.78s]  squish, squish, squish. The chocolate's going to be still solid, but it'll be melty and tender.
[8764.78s -> 8767.50s]  It's not going to ooze all over you. You're going to go, much better.
[8768.54s -> 8773.74s]  This scared me and made me drop this shit. A long time ago in a simulated forest, just like this one,
[8773.74s -> 8783.50s]  a bot family set up camp. Well, Kidbot heard a scraping noise coming from outside the campground.
[8783.58s -> 8788.06s]  The family went to investigate. What are these, what are these, like, textureless sausages?
[8789.10s -> 8799.18s]  As parent bot looked closer, it suddenly latched onto this screen, and you, excuse me, Maria.
[8799.18s -> 8805.42s]  Audio processor. It's so dry. A human. Would you mind giving me a nice hot cup of liquid?
[8819.96s -> 8824.20s]  I'm like, I'm like 10 years old. I'm older than you, and I shouldn't be acting that way.
[8824.84s -> 8854.76s]  100%. What I want. Oh, we can make tea. My niece does this. Every little kid has a little fake kid
[8854.76s -> 8862.12s]  guitar, and they just stand there and go, no, no, no, no. That's what I'm doing. This is my niece.
[8863.00s -> 8906.66s]  It's prop island. I did it. I filled them all up. We got honey. Hot sauce. Hope it's Tabasco.
[8906.74s -> 8920.31s]  Cool. Oh, cool. This is props. Oh, look at these props. Hey, human. Camping sucks.
[8920.87s -> 8926.55s]  My super dorky family is full, so he's made food for everything. I eat it raw. But what if you did
[8926.55s -> 8932.01s]  it and I took all the credit, eh? It would just be like a group project. Game of Thrones actress?
[8934.82s -> 8955.40s]  Camping sucks. Poodle? Wait. Prank? Why is that pranks? Cucumber coolant?
[8956.84s -> 8975.93s]  Food rehydrator. What are these? Oh, they're just little LEDs. Okay. What the fuck?
[8985.99s -> 8995.72s]  This is Play-Doh. All right, here you go. Let's be your kid. Hey, you want this? I made you a
[8995.72s -> 9006.30s]  Prado. I don't like it. I don't want to do anymore camera stuff. Garden. I can garden.
[9011.93s -> 9016.41s]  Maybe you should put something on my patented shrubifier. Then you can make some simple
[9016.41s -> 9046.60s]  topiary. Your garden is really starting to blossom. But any fact, you can plant anything
[9046.60s -> 9052.57s]  in the ground and watch it grow. I know because I tried. You could make it a shrub though.
[9074.97s -> 9086.95s]  I'm just having fun. I don't even know what's happening. All right, don't grow too much.
[9089.18s -> 9094.22s]  Your garden looks wonderful, human. Did I get a memory? It's gaming with carbon-based life
[9094.22s -> 9098.30s]  forms. Oh, you know, so you can shrink it. Use a memory of your horticultural demonstration.
[9104.18s -> 9115.03s]  Okay, so now what? Feel free to swing by and enter your garden anytime.
[9115.67s -> 9119.35s]  It's fertile ground. Look at that guy. Oh, wait, is this a horn?
[9119.75s -> 9137.50s]  Okay, cool. One more place to go. And then I'm going to play a different game,
[9140.04s -> 9154.58s]  like fishing, fishing, fucking finally. Hey, remember the banana for the day? Remember that?
[9155.22s -> 9172.04s]  I think the fish change color. Oh, we need green. Fish change color when you give them food.
[9172.84s -> 9189.56s]  Oh, I think they eat each other. That looks about right. Oh, here's some ancient fishing advice.
[9192.76s -> 9196.58s]  Hey, you just stole that out of my hand. It's like a seagull.
[9197.94s -> 9220.78s]  Ready? All right. Hey, this almost works, but it's not the right color.
[9221.42s -> 9231.69s]  Wow, that's yellow. Yellow trout. Oh, coin. I'll take that one. Ah, we've got you now, dick.
[9232.33s -> 9240.17s]  I need that banana back. Give me that banana. Blue salmon.
[9242.65s -> 9252.12s]  Am I eating this? All right, I'm going to catch a salmon.
[9252.68s -> 9260.02s]  To catch the right type of fish before we can give you credit.
[9260.02s -> 9269.62s]  A fish of all typecasts. So you have to find the right type of fish before we can give you credit.
[9272.22s -> 9283.00s]  Herder riding? What? Come here, you little fuck. Catfish. Salmon.
[9289.24s -> 9296.52s]  There's no better feeling in the world than finding what you're looking for yourself quietly.
[9296.52s -> 9301.29s]  Wow. There may be plenty of fish in the river, but I'm going to permanently
[9301.29s -> 9311.06s]  commit these to my memory storage. Thank you. That was fun. Is there anything else to do here?
[9311.86s -> 9321.61s]  I'm going to get all the memories. I'm over it. Oh, wait. Arm for coins. I think I did everything.
[9321.61s -> 9330.46s]  Wait. Welcome to the welcome center. Well, come on in. This is too big.
[9331.42s -> 9336.66s]  And this machine will accept any official wood chips.
[9336.66s -> 9339.54s]  I really want. I think I've seen some lying around in the forest.
[9339.54s -> 9347.24s]  In the fart one, right? How do you blow it up?
[9347.24s -> 9361.24s]  Please, you grabbed my acorn bar and slingshot. Just pull back the string to fling.
[9361.96s -> 9362.68s]  Give me a wave.
[9364.68s -> 9367.32s]  Most fun thing of the whole game. You waited to the very end. Show it to me.
[9368.52s -> 9381.29s]  This is so much fun. You beat Bart Simpson.
[9387.18s -> 9400.30s]  You take this currency. All right. New game.
[9401.02s -> 9403.90s]  I'm going to go piss, though, and I'm going to get some water.
[9403.90s -> 9407.03s]  We'll play another one. This was fucking fun. I really like this.
[9412.15s -> 9424.38s]  That back up on. But finally, he's all right. Let's move on.
[9425.10s -> 9428.73s]  I'll be right back. Just going to get something to drink and go pee.
[9637.48s -> 9656.31s]  OK, we're going to do next. I have a shitload of games. Half Life Alex.
[9656.31s -> 9665.66s]  No, we're doing that tomorrow. I've only probably got another hour or so in me in VR.
[9665.66s -> 9674.94s]  Let's see. What can we do? Half Life Alex is tomorrow.
[9674.94s -> 9679.16s]  I really want to start Half Life Alex and just do that.
[9679.16s -> 9691.34s]  OK, close this. OK, we got. I'm going to throw out some things here.
[9691.34s -> 9703.35s]  Let's see. I got Tap House VR. The room is going to be so much fun.
[9703.35s -> 9711.59s]  I got a bunch of scary shit, too. Bone Works 2. That'll be probably soon.
[9714.38s -> 9718.26s]  Pistol Whip. Oh, I want to try Pistol Whip.
[9718.26s -> 9725.45s]  I was told this game is really crazy. All right. Pistol Whip it is.
[9725.45s -> 9732.30s]  Let's get it open. Is this putting a command prompt?
[9736.94s -> 9740.54s]  Scary game? Yeah, I'll do. We'll do a whole night of scary shit on VR.
[9740.54s -> 9752.42s]  Ratatouille VR. That was a lot of fun, though. That was just chilling.
[9752.98s -> 9755.46s]  I played that for three hours. I can't fucking believe that.
[9756.97s -> 9764.17s]  When's Chubby Bunny? I don't know. I have to go get marshmallows.
[9764.17s -> 9771.32s]  So Pistol Whip, from my understanding, is a game where you have to VR shoot enemies to the beat.
[9771.32s -> 9777.03s]  I think it's pretty flashy, too. So I think I'm going to give a warning here.
[9777.03s -> 9780.79s]  It's probably an epileptic warning at the beginning of this game.
[9780.79s -> 9795.86s]  This is not a porn game. I've played it. It's a totally... It's an epileptic warning.
[9795.86s -> 9799.45s]  All right. Well, let's be real. It's probably going to be really...
[9799.45s -> 9802.95s]  Especially in VR, too. But I heard it was really fun.
[9802.95s -> 9807.80s]  I got a lot of recommendations from VR Josh. So he's given me some pretty good ones.
[9807.80s -> 9814.68s]  So many VR games have come out over the last year and a half since I last played.
[9814.68s -> 9820.15s]  All right. Why is it taking so long? Performing first time setup with a command prompt open.
[9820.15s -> 9821.91s]  Like, why do I... What is this?
[9821.91s -> 9828.26s]  I've never played a Steam game that had a blank command prompt three times in a row.
[9828.26s -> 9834.46s]  We good? All right. Here we go.
[9834.46s -> 9836.30s]  Hopefully, this is not loud. I'm going to turn it down.
[9836.30s -> 9840.82s]  Pistol Whip.
[9840.82s -> 9856.97s]  You hear it? Okay. All right. I think we're good. I think I'm ready.
[9856.97s -> 9870.39s]  Let's move this back over. Hello? Hi there. I'm going to go back in.
[9870.95s -> 9874.18s]  You might be able to turn down the flashiness in the settings. Really?
[9878.71s -> 9884.95s]  He's going in. Not yet. I'm going in in about 15 seconds.
[9885.59s -> 9893.29s]  Start. Training. I probably should do the training, right?
[9895.35s -> 9902.47s]  Keyboard mode. Dude's actually handsome.
[9908.28s -> 9910.52s]  All right. This is a good... I think this is a good spot to start.
[9911.46s -> 9913.62s]  And like here. Like right here. This is pretty good.
[9914.34s -> 9919.80s]  Although I always like drift over to be out of frame like half the time. So...
[9926.60s -> 9932.18s]  Uh, all right. Get the right headphone, please.
[9932.90s -> 9939.02s]  New modifiers. Vengeance and disorder.
[9946.71s -> 9960.79s]  Oh, shit. He are Ratatouille waiting room.
[9960.79s -> 9963.83s]  No, I didn't mean to shoot. All right. Now I got a real red dot.
[9966.12s -> 9974.74s]  Who's going to say Ratatouille waiting room? I can't get him.
[9977.78s -> 9982.66s]  All right. How do we do it? Training. Put on your straps.
[9982.66s -> 9987.48s]  Oh, shit. Shoot enemy. Dodge bullets.
[9994.28s -> 10000.74s]  Aim down to reload. Losing armor.
[10002.70s -> 10006.34s]  Powered. Shoot enemies. Repair armor.
[10015.05s -> 10023.72s]  Dodge. Duck. Dodge. Punch.
[10024.28s -> 10029.59s]  All right. I got to put this on. This game's sick.
[10029.59s -> 10032.23s]  Holy shit. This is a ton of fun. This is awesome.
[10032.79s -> 10038.33s]  I can't wait to play this. Modifiers. Player options. Game options.
[10039.13s -> 10041.13s]  Scenes. Let's go right into one.
[10045.99s -> 10057.99s]  Oh, I get the big one. I think this is the kind of gun that I would use.
[10057.99s -> 10066.92s]  Like the James Bond movie. You just go... Oh my God.
[10066.92s -> 10068.84s]  No, not the Deagle. The Deagle's the meme gun.
[10069.80s -> 10073.50s]  It's really loud. Where are you?
[10073.50s -> 10078.66s]  It's not really loud. I can see it.
[10079.22s -> 10081.80s]  All right. I'm taking the little baby gun. Customize.
[10082.74s -> 10089.22s]  Dude, what? Minecraft. Minecraft Creeper gun.
[10095.99s -> 10101.67s]  Oh, this is the sound. Ooh.
[10102.71s -> 10116.22s]  What do you think? I think I like five and four.
[10117.26s -> 10133.11s]  Five. Three's pretty good, too. I like five.
[10133.67s -> 10145.16s]  Minecraft. Gone. Founder's collection.
[10145.96s -> 10152.36s]  Ooh. Oh. Oh, this is John Wick.
[10153.00s -> 10162.98s]  All right. I'm going with this. I didn't go Ember's Another Day.
[10163.54s -> 10167.43s]  How about just the first one? How about Death?
[10184.26s -> 10232.98s]  Oh. The dragon. Oh, I love it.
[10233.62s -> 10309.10s]  Oh, shit. I lost hearing.
[10309.10s -> 10349.02s]  I'm losing my hearing. I can't. I can't.
[10349.02s -> 10383.42s]  I'm only hearing one ear. Oh my God.
[10383.42s -> 10390.06s]  He's reload Randy. He reloaded Randy.
[10391.35s -> 10395.90s]  Holy shit. My underwear. Oh, there's a song.
[10396.54s -> 10415.88s]  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. Oh.
[10424.66s -> 10429.46s]  I think I'm back against the reddit shelf.
[10439.85s -> 10441.13s]  Where should I move? Where should I move?
[10441.69s -> 10452.23s]  Come on. I need this other hearing.
[10453.59s -> 10465.19s]  Fucking stupid ass thing, man. Look at this shit.
[10469.88s -> 10471.64s]  I'm going to put these in until they hurt.
[10472.79s -> 10478.52s]  Come on. Get in there and fucking stay in there.
[10479.43s -> 10486.76s]  Ugh. Dude, I can't even fucking aim.
[10486.76s -> 10489.16s]  If I go for this way, I'm going to smash the bottom.
[10489.16s -> 10491.32s]  If I go this way, it's a fucking reddit shelf.
[10491.96s -> 10568.49s]  Come on. Bang, bang, bang, bang.
[10574.71s -> 10575.90s]  I can't hear anything.
[10614.39s -> 10615.91s]  Oh, I hit my head on the ceiling.
[10642.65s -> 10689.46s]  Oh, God. Come on.
[10689.46s -> 10691.06s]  Better this time. Better this time.
[10691.06s -> 10748.34s]  Come on, Wick. Okay. All right.
[10748.34s -> 10751.13s]  How much health do I have? How much health do I have?
[10757.82s -> 10814.15s]  All right. Yes.
[10814.15s -> 10819.48s]  He's going to need what? I got the baby.
[10820.28s -> 10822.92s]  I got a B. I got a B.
[10822.92s -> 10830.25s]  He's going to need another two months off.
[10830.25s -> 10848.12s]  All right. Let's do the gun. Bolden gun.
[10848.92s -> 10856.65s]  Let's try. God fucking dammit. I feel like a warehouse.
[10856.65s -> 10863.69s]  All right. Let's go.
[10863.69s -> 10871.75s]  All right. How about revelations?
[10872.47s -> 10891.10s]  Let's go.
[10891.10s -> 10893.74s]  Tuber music. My hands are so sweaty.
[10894.54s -> 10914.57s]  The speed is fast.
[10940.23s -> 10941.80s]  What songs are?
[10942.92s -> 10959.14s]  I'm like doing a K-pop song. Dance.
[10987.22s -> 10990.10s]  That's not how you should come out of VR.
[10997.72s -> 11001.08s]  That's not the best way to get removes from VR.
[11001.64s -> 11004.65s]  Somebody just pulled my scalp off.
[11004.65s -> 11006.25s]  I feel like I was just in a Scooby Doo movie
[11006.25s -> 11007.85s]  and they just revealed me as the villain.
[11015.56s -> 11016.28s]  I think we're okay.
[11021.99s -> 11024.07s]  Like I was doing like a K-pop dance
[11024.07s -> 11026.23s]  and I like lost my wig on stage.
[11028.22s -> 11029.42s]  It's not broken. It's fine.
[11030.86s -> 11031.26s]  It's fine.
[11031.90s -> 11035.66s]  That's because I stepped on the cord.
[11035.66s -> 11036.62s]  It pulled back.
[11038.55s -> 11040.09s]  Did you at least get to see it?
[11040.81s -> 11042.73s]  Did you get to see the thing fly off?
[11042.73s -> 11043.37s]  I hope so.
[11050.20s -> 11051.32s]  It doesn't help.
[11051.32s -> 11053.48s]  My head is... Look at how sweaty I am.
[11054.12s -> 11056.04s]  This is the sweatiest I've ever been in my life.
[11056.04s -> 11058.20s]  Of course it's going to be greased up and be able to fly off.
[11059.40s -> 11064.10s]  This game is a lot of fun too.
[11064.10s -> 11066.41s]  Shit. Watch the clip.
[11067.05s -> 11084.55s]  I'm like doing a K-pop song. Dance.
[11105.46s -> 11107.38s]  Dude, it looks like it wasn't even on.
[11107.38s -> 11110.18s]  It looks like it was just barely on my fucking face.
[11110.90s -> 11113.54s]  It was attached tight as hell.
[11136.22s -> 11144.12s]  Okay, I'm going to get back into the game.
[11150.20s -> 11150.92s]  Show the clip.
[11150.92s -> 11151.48s]  Hold on.
[11151.48s -> 11154.33s]  Let me see if I can get it on screen.
[11154.33s -> 11155.37s]  No, we'll do it later.
[11155.37s -> 11156.01s]  I'm almost like...
[11156.97s -> 11161.03s]  I can't fucking believe this is happening.
[11161.03s -> 11161.75s]  Do normal?
[11166.74s -> 11168.66s]  Pressing the eject button in VR.
[11170.44s -> 11171.56s]  Okay, that's like...
[11171.56s -> 11172.60s]  Press that button.
[11172.60s -> 11173.32s]  Mom's home.
[11173.32s -> 11175.72s]  You haven't finished your homework yet and you're in VR
[11175.72s -> 11178.52s]  and you got to fucking open up like a word pad real quick
[11178.52s -> 11179.64s]  and write a bunch of bullshit.
[11181.70s -> 11182.58s]  Alright, let's get back in.
[11183.22s -> 11189.58s]  I was doing really well there too.
[11189.58s -> 11191.42s]  I was doing really good.
[11191.42s -> 11203.88s]  There's no way.
[11205.00s -> 11211.51s]  Oh, look.
[11212.15s -> 11212.89s]  I died.
[11213.45s -> 11219.27s]  Destroying VR headset to farm plus twos.
[11219.91s -> 11221.46s]  Click the link, please.
[11221.46s -> 11222.58s]  Omega lul.
[11222.58s -> 11223.22s]  Okay, hold on.
[11223.94s -> 11226.04s]  How do I have hair in my mouth?
[11231.88s -> 11233.16s]  Okay, this is fucking funny.
[11239.29s -> 11244.17s]  This looks like if you woke somebody up out of a deep sleep
[11244.97s -> 11249.22s]  instantly, they were sleeping and you just shook them hard
[11249.22s -> 11251.22s]  and said, dude, wake the fuck up.
[11251.22s -> 11272.09s]  Look at the hair being pulled back too.
[11275.66s -> 11276.86s]  Like a sleepwalker.
[11278.12s -> 11279.40s]  Oh my god, the sleepwalker.
[11279.40s -> 11281.08s]  He's like holding a gun in his dream.
[11281.08s -> 11282.68s]  What the fuck is going on over there?
[11286.39s -> 11287.35s]  Alright, speaking of...
[11287.35s -> 11289.51s]  I got to like increase the brightness on this fucking thing.
[11290.07s -> 11297.48s]  This looks like shit.
[11298.20s -> 11299.64s]  Why am I like in a shadow?
[11299.64s -> 11300.20s]  Oh, there we go.
[11300.20s -> 11300.76s]  No, I'm not.
[11300.76s -> 11303.19s]  I still need to brighten it up.
[11305.86s -> 11306.26s]  Dying.
[11308.17s -> 11309.29s]  Okay, there we go.
[11309.29s -> 11316.10s]  Okay, let's try this again.
[11316.66s -> 11324.33s]  You fell asleep with your bike helmet on?
[11325.54s -> 11327.14s]  Stay away from the Reddit collection.
[11327.14s -> 11330.50s]  Yeah, that was a lot going on in that last fucking 20 minutes.
[11331.06s -> 11339.46s]  Funko alert?
[11339.46s -> 11339.94s]  What's wrong?
[11340.58s -> 11344.68s]  There's a gif now?
[11346.50s -> 11347.30s]  It's alright.
[11347.30s -> 11348.50s]  Alright, I got to be ready for this
[11348.50s -> 11349.62s]  because this is going to rip the fuck out.
[11349.62s -> 11351.14s]  No more like K-pop dancing.
[11351.14s -> 11351.78s]  That would be nice.
[11352.50s -> 11358.46s]  Check the gif.
[11359.62s -> 11361.22s]  Show gif, show gif, show gif.
[11374.25s -> 11380.66s]  This thing, this strap doesn't work, man.
[11380.66s -> 11381.93s]  I'm telling you.
[11381.93s -> 11408.12s]  Let's see the whole thing.
[11408.12s -> 11410.28s]  Well, hopefully there's nothing actually wrong with this
[11410.28s -> 11412.92s]  because that fell from like six feet high.
[11412.92s -> 11417.54s]  It's wet in here.
[11417.54s -> 11426.20s]  Hey, everyone was like, dude, just get an index.
[11426.20s -> 11427.24s]  The index is way better.
[11427.24s -> 11429.48s]  Well, I don't need to do that now.
[11430.20s -> 11432.70s]  Alright, I'm back.
[11433.26s -> 11434.14s]  This game is so much fun.
[11434.14s -> 11434.78s]  I'm going to relax.
[11434.78s -> 11436.22s]  I'm getting just too into it.
[11436.22s -> 11439.85s]  What the fuck did I just do?
[11440.33s -> 11444.06s]  No, get this off.
[11444.06s -> 11444.86s]  What button did I press?
[11445.42s -> 11447.62s]  How do I turn this off?
[11448.18s -> 11450.47s]  How do I turn this off?
[11451.11s -> 11454.94s]  I'm going to lose all my hair in the front of my fucking head.
[11454.94s -> 11455.42s]  I know it.
[11456.14s -> 11459.34s]  I'm going to lose all my fucking hair.
[11460.63s -> 11461.19s]  Inevitable.
[11463.05s -> 11464.65s]  Okay, return to game.
[11466.50s -> 11467.94s]  Okay, you guys can hear it, right?
[11467.94s -> 11469.22s]  I didn't like unplug any cords.
[11470.41s -> 11471.29s]  Get this behind us.
[11472.01s -> 11473.75s]  I say us, I mean me.
[11475.85s -> 11476.81s]  Okay, you still there?
[11477.53s -> 11480.55s]  Still there?
[11481.35s -> 11482.23s]  You are.
[11482.23s -> 11483.03s]  Alright.
[11483.03s -> 11487.30s]  Am I in a good spot?
[11487.86s -> 11494.71s]  I'm not going to move.
[11495.43s -> 11501.10s]  I'm going to do it like Doom.
[11565.06s -> 11612.66s]  Go.
[11612.66s -> 11613.86s]  Yeah, you fucking asshole.
[11614.98s -> 11623.75s]  That was loud.
[11623.75s -> 11625.42s]  I just screamed.
[11625.42s -> 11626.46s]  I need a different gun.
[11627.26s -> 11627.90s]  I don't want this song.
[11627.90s -> 11639.78s]  I don't like this song.
[11639.78s -> 11640.10s]  Boom.
[11641.77s -> 11642.09s]  Kick.
[11645.40s -> 11646.76s]  Yes, fucking dead man.
[11647.48s -> 11654.17s]  Two gun mode?
[11654.17s -> 11654.73s]  What?
[11654.73s -> 11725.88s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[11725.88s -> 11726.76s]  Oh shit.
[11726.76s -> 11728.60s]  Make sure you play this to father gas going.
[11729.40s -> 11815.93s]  Win?
[11815.93s -> 11816.57s]  Yo.
[11816.57s -> 11819.05s]  Uh, yo.
[11819.05s -> 11822.86s]  The 99% on beat accuracy.
[11822.86s -> 11828.81s]  Can I do two?
[11829.37s -> 11834.10s]  A laser gun?
[11837.11s -> 11837.83s]  Super soaker?
[11838.63s -> 11841.83s]  Merry Christmas?
[11842.87s -> 11845.38s]  I'll do a Merry Christmas gun.
[11845.94s -> 11851.61s]  Kind of like a candy cane.
[11852.65s -> 11857.16s]  What else we got?
[11859.32s -> 11859.72s]  Aptics.
[11860.52s -> 11874.41s]  Turn on dual weld?
[11876.49s -> 11877.53s]  Dual weld?
[11877.53s -> 11878.17s]  How do I do that?
[11882.26s -> 11884.10s]  I'm wearing like a club right now.
[11884.10s -> 11885.14s]  I have things in my ears.
[11885.86s -> 11886.90s]  Modifiers.
[11886.90s -> 11893.08s]  Wait, how do I get there?
[11900.62s -> 11901.10s]  Welders?
[11902.46s -> 11904.46s]  No fail dead eye.
[11907.51s -> 11908.07s]  Scavenger?
[11911.02s -> 11911.74s]  Oh shit.
[11914.23s -> 11914.95s]  Oh man.
[11915.75s -> 11920.07s]  Hey, hat's on, right?
[11922.57s -> 11923.61s]  I'm going to get these little ones.
[11924.65s -> 11929.90s]  Run on spot welding?
[11929.90s -> 11930.62s]  I don't know what that means.
[11932.41s -> 11933.29s]  All right, let's go.
[11933.29s -> 11933.93s]  On hard.
[11933.93s -> 11935.05s]  This is fucking hard, boy.
[11999.67s -> 12000.17s]  Bang.
[12049.48s -> 12050.04s]  No.
[12050.04s -> 12051.27s]  Oh, that's hard.
[12051.99s -> 12053.43s]  Holy shit.
[12053.43s -> 12064.22s]  We're going back to normal, boys and girls.
[12064.78s -> 12101.96s]  Let's go.
[12101.96s -> 12137.96s]  Oh shit.
[12167.10s -> 12167.98s]  Sloppy.
[12167.98s -> 12168.48s]  Sloppy.
[12169.50s -> 12170.00s]  Sloppy.
[12170.62s -> 12171.18s]  Sloppy.
[12171.18s -> 12171.68s]  Sloppy.
[12172.06s -> 12173.58s]  The house is on fire at The Sims.
[12174.46s -> 12233.67s]  Oh my god.
[12260.28s -> 12282.66s]  I feel something behind me.
[12298.52s -> 12299.64s]  Oh my god.
[12306.31s -> 12306.87s]  Eh.
[12306.87s -> 12316.28s]  I'm doing over 4550 for the best person in the fuck.
[12316.28s -> 12316.84s]  I'm tired.
[12317.56s -> 12329.18s]  All right, I'm going to do one more.
[12333.30s -> 12344.44s]  Damn.
[12344.44s -> 12353.50s]  Okay, that's good.
[12357.48s -> 12358.20s]  Holy shit.
[12366.28s -> 12366.84s]  Big bits?
[12368.02s -> 12369.62s]  250 fucking dollars.
[12369.62s -> 12370.98s]  Who gave 250 bucks?
[12371.62s -> 12375.86s]  Listen, I like this one's easy, right?
[12376.42s -> 12391.06s]  What's the beat?
[12392.10s -> 12409.42s]  This way.
[12414.66s -> 12469.94s]  Fuck you.
[12469.94s -> 12482.52s]  All right, I'm going to do it sitting down.
[12483.08s -> 12532.12s]  Not even stand up and reload.
[12533.00s -> 12909.90s]  Hold on.
[12909.90s -> 12913.66s]  Have I been doing VR in like tiny bri-ball brain mode?
[12913.66s -> 12920.22s]  Average is 64.
[12920.22s -> 12921.34s]  Oh, then I'm good.
[12921.34s -> 12930.04s]  Yeah, I had it on 64.
[12930.04s -> 12930.60s]  Yeah, I'm good.
[12931.16s -> 12933.69s]  And use your phone to measure it.
[12934.25s -> 12939.74s]  I think I'm done.
[12940.30s -> 12941.98s]  I don't think I can do anymore.
[12941.98s -> 12945.38s]  Has it been like four hours?
[12945.94s -> 12947.38s]  I really wanted to get to four.
[12948.60s -> 12950.20s]  I really want to get to four hours.
[12950.84s -> 12959.27s]  He's weak.
[12960.30s -> 12961.02s]  Yeah.
[12961.02s -> 12961.58s]  Yeah, I am.
[12965.93s -> 12967.45s]  Yeah, I'm going to call it.
[12967.45s -> 12968.65s]  I'm going back tomorrow.
[12968.65s -> 12970.09s]  We're going to do Half-Life Alex tomorrow.
[12970.09s -> 12971.37s]  I feel like there's not going to be a whole lot of
[12972.33s -> 12974.33s]  diving around like a psychopath
[12974.33s -> 12976.73s]  and dancing to music for an hour straight.
[12976.73s -> 12980.20s]  That was a ton of fun though.
[12980.20s -> 12981.80s]  I forgot how much fun this fucking really was.
[12982.52s -> 12985.74s]  Oh dear goodness.
[12985.74s -> 12986.22s]  I need to tell you.
[12986.22s -> 12988.22s]  I'm going to hop in the shower as soon as this is over.
[12991.30s -> 12992.74s]  It looks like I already did take a shower.
[12993.46s -> 12995.06s]  It looks like I just got out of the shower.
[12996.38s -> 12997.34s]  Doesn't it?
[12997.34s -> 12999.53s]  Looks like I just got out.
[12999.53s -> 13003.96s]  Holy shit.
[13003.96s -> 13004.68s]  Yeah, I know, man.
[13005.32s -> 13006.39s]  I know, man.
[13006.39s -> 13006.87s]  Seriously.
[13010.58s -> 13011.54s]  You jelled?
[13011.54s -> 13012.02s]  I'm wet.
[13012.02s -> 13013.62s]  Yeah, I'm actually physically wet.
[13016.86s -> 13017.26s]  All right.
[13017.98s -> 13022.23s]  I do want to say Foxymuffin gave $250 fucking dollars.
[13022.97s -> 13023.69s]  That's insane.
[13024.65s -> 13026.33s]  Longtime fan decided to actually support you.
[13026.33s -> 13026.65s]  Keep it up.
[13026.65s -> 13028.57s]  That's 25,000 bits.
[13028.57s -> 13029.85s]  That's too much money.
[13029.85s -> 13032.01s]  I'll take it though.
[13032.01s -> 13034.01s]  I mean, that's unnecessary, but I'll take it.
[13034.01s -> 13036.17s]  That's a lot of money.
[13036.17s -> 13037.77s]  Thank you for the $250.
[13037.77s -> 13038.41s]  Holy shit.
[13038.97s -> 13041.18s]  Goiki gave $50.
[13041.18s -> 13043.26s]  Draw my fursona in VR when I play Tilt Brush.
[13043.26s -> 13044.46s]  Remind me, I will.
[13044.46s -> 13045.67s]  Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[13045.67s -> 13048.63s]  Freddy Dredd gave 50 community subs and Lovely...
[13048.63s -> 13053.34s]  What if I just went boom and passed out?
[13054.38s -> 13055.98s]  Lovely and Jubbly gave $50 too.
[13055.98s -> 13056.94s]  My heart is broken.
[13056.94s -> 13058.30s]  No far cry.
[13058.30s -> 13061.94s]  Probably not.
[13061.94s -> 13065.54s]  That game is fucking hard and broken and annoying.
[13065.54s -> 13070.84s]  It was fun in 2004.
[13070.84s -> 13071.16s]  Maybe.
[13072.28s -> 13072.92s]  He lied.
[13074.04s -> 13074.68s]  Yeah, I know.
[13074.68s -> 13075.24s]  That's what I do.
[13076.97s -> 13077.85s]  All right, guys.
[13077.85s -> 13078.65s]  I will see you later.
[13078.65s -> 13080.41s]  We're going to run the credits.
[13080.41s -> 13082.73s]  And I'm going to just get up and fucking go in the shower.
[13082.73s -> 13086.26s]  I'm dying.
[13086.26s -> 13087.54s]  Here come all the subs from today.
[13087.94s -> 13089.29s]  Thank you, everybody.
[13093.03s -> 13093.67s]  Really appreciate it.
[13093.67s -> 13095.75s]  This channel has tons and tons of subs.
[13095.75s -> 13098.31s]  You guys continue to support this channel with tons of money.
[13098.87s -> 13100.15s]  Hopefully, I spent it well.
[13100.15s -> 13100.95s]  I'll try to.
[13101.67s -> 13103.24s]  Thanks a lot, though.
[13103.24s -> 13106.66s]  Seriously.
[13106.66s -> 13107.54s]  VR is a ton of fun.
[13107.54s -> 13109.70s]  You'll see Half-Life Alex will be tomorrow.
[13109.70s -> 13113.05s]  I just kind of wanted to get used to VR again
[13113.05s -> 13118.66s]  before I jumped right into the best VR game that's ever been made.
[13118.66s -> 13121.91s]  So tomorrow should be pretty solid.
[13121.91s -> 13128.46s]  Thanks again, everybody.
[13128.46s -> 13130.44s]  Same time tomorrow?
[13130.44s -> 13132.87s]  Yeah, we'll probably start around 2 p.m. tomorrow.
[13132.87s -> 13133.59s]  Pacific.
[13133.59s -> 13135.38s]  I was going to start around 1,
[13135.38s -> 13137.46s]  but I had to go do an errand.
[13137.46s -> 13138.50s]  I had to run out of the house.
[13138.50s -> 13147.10s]  Make sure your PC can actually run Half-Life Alex.
[13147.10s -> 13147.82s]  Wait, what?
[13147.82s -> 13152.18s]  What do you mean?
[13152.18s -> 13153.14s]  Add good graphics.
[13153.14s -> 13155.70s]  Wait, is it really taxing on the computer?
[13158.04s -> 13159.32s]  Will a 1080 work?
[13159.32s -> 13165.53s]  That should be fine.
[13168.39s -> 13173.85s]  1080 is fine.
[13173.85s -> 13174.17s]  Okay.
[13174.17s -> 13174.89s]  Yes, idiot.
[13174.89s -> 13175.61s]  It's in VR.
[13176.73s -> 13177.85s]  Why did you call me an idiot?
[13178.49s -> 13180.09s]  I'm not the one that said it wasn't going to work.
[13182.25s -> 13183.45s]  Why am I the idiot?
[13183.45s -> 13184.97s]  I was just reacting to what they said.
[13186.17s -> 13194.98s]  I use 1080 at max graphics,
[13194.98s -> 13200.14s]  but streaming also bogs up the system.
[13200.14s -> 13201.02s]  Well, I just won't run it.
[13201.02s -> 13208.33s]  I won't do max graphics.
[13208.33s -> 13209.69s]  Thanks, everybody.
[13209.69s -> 13212.65s]  I am going to run away right now and just go into the shower.
[13215.70s -> 13216.58s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[13216.58s -> 13218.26s]  Probably same time for Half-Life Alex,
[13218.26s -> 13220.18s]  unless it can't run on my computer.
[13220.18s -> 13225.24s]  Take care of yourselves, guys.
[13225.88s -> 13230.70s]  Have a great rest of your day or night, depending on where you are.
[13230.70s -> 13289.85s]  I'll see you tomorrow.
