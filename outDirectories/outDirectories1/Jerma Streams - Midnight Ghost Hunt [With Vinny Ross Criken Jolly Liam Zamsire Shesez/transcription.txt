[1.27s -> 11.24s]  Oh hello, how are you? Alright, currently in the middle of a game. We've got a big thing going
[11.24s -> 21.03s]  on here today, but real quick before we get started. Really quickly. Hold on, I'm hearing
[21.03s -> 27.03s]  two things in my ear at the same time. We're doing Midnight Ghost Hunt with a huge group.
[27.59s -> 32.98s]  Let me go over and do this real quick though. I know Shito is supposed to be on camera. Let's
[32.98s -> 53.10s]  go ahead and do that real quick. One sec. Okay, so here you go. Here we go. You guys ready?
[67.80s -> 77.30s]  It doesn't have batteries.
[82.44s -> 86.76s]  Alright, I ate it. Alright, we're gonna play it again. I don't know why there's no batteries
[86.76s -> 92.50s]  every time. Alright, I gotta get into the game. Welcome everybody. We're playing. There's no facecam
[92.50s -> 107.83s]  today. Turn it off. Alright, here we go. I'm currently live right now. I just want to let
[107.83s -> 122.01s]  everybody know that there is a live audience watching you right now. Hi. Okay, so we...
[122.01s -> 127.38s]  What's the... Oh, I'm not talking to them. Why am I doing zero damage? I have to hold the button
[127.38s -> 135.16s]  down. What? I will kill you. Can somebody give like a quick 15 second like how this game works?
[137.26s -> 145.45s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This proximity, I can hear you. I have to find out where you are.
[145.45s -> 157.66s]  Where are you? Stunning. I have no idea what's going on. Oh, I tabbed out and I died, I think.
[158.46s -> 170.97s]  What do you mean no audio? There's audio. You can hear that. How do you guys not hear that? Turn it up.
[170.97s -> 182.76s]  I gotta hit you, dude. What was that? You can hear that just fine. Can you hear me right now?
[183.48s -> 188.52s]  I can hear you, yeah. Okay, okay, cool. I think I died. You guys can resuscitate me if you guys
[188.52s -> 193.24s]  get the defibrillator thing. Sorry, yeah, I got distracted by several ghosts running around.
[193.24s -> 200.92s]  Yeah, I alt tab to start capture and... You got murdered? I got murdered. Okay, I got you.
[200.92s -> 208.31s]  This game is fun. Yeah, I'm liking it so far. All right. Oh, you're all screwed. Killer plant behind
[208.31s -> 218.97s]  you. Holy shit. Oh, I'm back. I got guy behind, guy behind. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm knocked
[218.97s -> 224.17s]  out. Neither do I. Am I shooting teammates? What's happening?
[243.51s -> 247.27s]  I don't have time, Ross. I'm sorry. No, you're all good, man. Okay, are we good?
[247.67s -> 257.43s]  Yeah. Good try. That's better. Okay, all right. That was a cool little warmup.
[257.43s -> 263.06s]  It's all right. Yeah. Now I understand how the game works. All right, so we got Vinny,
[263.06s -> 268.34s]  we got Criken, we got Ross, we got other people. I'm gonna end this lobby, hop back into the call,
[268.34s -> 275.77s]  we'll get started, and then we'll hop into a new one. Sounds good. Okay, sounds good. All right,
[275.77s -> 279.37s]  so that was the warmup. We're just gonna be doing a little introduction here. This is not Elden Ring.
[279.37s -> 291.02s]  No, it's not. Okay, so we had to jump into a little lobby. Remember, you're streaming. Oh,
[291.02s -> 297.05s]  yeah. Oh, I want to go over quickly. Really quickly. Uh, quick before I have to get in the
[297.05s -> 305.11s]  server. Oh, right. So tomorrow, the idea was I was gonna do DOS games tomorrow. We're changing that.
[306.55s -> 312.60s]  Wrestling Empire got a huge update, and we're gonna play it. I want a little bit more time
[312.60s -> 319.53s]  to curate the DOS stuff. We'll do DOS this weekend. Wrestling Empire tomorrow. There apparently was
[319.53s -> 324.33s]  an unbelievably hilarious update. I have to play it, so that's what we're doing tomorrow.
[324.33s -> 333.13s]  Are we using the same, uh, let me just confirm. Same code? So this game is kind of like Prop Hunt,
[333.13s -> 340.17s]  but it's like Left 4 Dead and Prop Hunt combined. Seems like fun. I did the tutorial. We're just
[340.17s -> 349.75s]  trying to do audio testing to make sure it works. This game sucks. I have eight minutes in the game.
[349.75s -> 355.37s]  Can we relax for a second, please? Can we just relax for a moment, please?
[355.37s -> 358.49s]  And you've seen, you've seen like us audio testing.
[365.90s -> 378.52s]  Okay, let me check. Is this the same code? I think we're doing a different code.
[378.52s -> 386.39s]  Why are you so tense? I'm good. This game is worse than Elden Ring. Well, not every game can be Elden
[386.39s -> 397.91s]  Ring. I'm sorry. Got a new code. Yeah, I, this is, I was gonna just wait to stream tomorrow,
[399.88s -> 405.80s]  but yeah, we're here. Good to see, uh, this group again. Vinny, Kraikin, these guys. It's been a
[405.80s -> 411.91s]  long time since I played with Kraikin. Or Vinny. Or Ross. It's been a while. All right, here we go.
[417.78s -> 422.30s]  I like how the game actually has like a lobby system though. So we don't have to have like
[422.30s -> 431.86s]  10 people at each other on Steam, which can always kind of be a pain in the ass.
[431.86s -> 441.13s]  Did that work? It worked. Okay. All right. You guys ready? How come you're so tense?
[441.21s -> 450.28s]  I'm a tense person. I went in for a massage like the other day and the person could not need.
[450.28s -> 455.19s]  They couldn't. It was like a brick. They were like, all right, that's like funny. Take off
[455.19s -> 459.51s]  like the cement jacket. And I was like, what are you talking about? My mic is off? What?
[459.51s -> 466.84s]  No, we're good. I just want to make sure that the lobby code's not here. It's not. All right. I can,
[466.84s -> 474.20s]  I can put it up. Can you hear me? I feel like that's been the whole stream so far for like the
[474.20s -> 481.21s]  first 10 minutes. It's like, Hey dude, can you hear me? Can you hear me? All right. So I'm on
[481.21s -> 485.61s]  the hunter team. The, our goal is to hunt the ghosts, just like prop hunt. People can hide in
[485.61s -> 499.74s]  chairs and, and curtains and all that shit. He's too tense. No, I'm, I'm, I'm a very tense person.
[499.74s -> 513.93s]  You're my favorite. Thank you. This seems fun. It does seem fun. Let's try it. I'm waiting for
[513.93s -> 522.26s]  players. So it looks like this, what do we got on this team? Vinnie, Liam, she says, I'm sorry.
[522.26s -> 529.53s]  Cricut. All right. So we're all right. This is a good team. This is a good team. Let's just start
[529.53s -> 536.71s]  doing yoga. No, yo yoga freaks me out because I get, I get even more tense in yoga because I
[536.71s -> 546.92s]  know I can't do the moves and I, it's embarrassing. It's like, Oh, put your leg over here and put your
[546.92s -> 550.28s]  head over this way and like raise your arm and leg up. And I can't do it. And I just ended up sitting
[550.28s -> 559.90s]  on the, on the pad like this until the next move. I just like, I don't want to do it. I can do the
[559.90s -> 567.96s]  really easy ones. Why would I even pay to do yoga with like a yoga instructor? If there's three moves
[567.96s -> 575.21s]  that I can do, I could just do those here and save whatever X amount of dollars it is to go
[575.21s -> 585.29s]  to yoga. You're inflexible. Well, yeah. The last like two or three years, you know, spamming
[585.29s -> 595.88s]  resident sleepers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. So I want to use, I don't have
[595.88s -> 603.72s]  any money, so it doesn't matter. Vacuum. Once a ghost is dead, you suck them up. I'll just start.
[603.72s -> 607.91s]  I'm just going to go with whatever I need. All right. Let's do it. All right. What do you say?
[608.47s -> 615.30s]  We say guys, there's nobody here. Oh, hello. Ready to catch some ghost. Hi team. We're,
[615.30s -> 624.49s]  I think we're only doing C. Sorry. This is Q. Yeah. Oh, you too. You can do load out and then
[624.49s -> 636.06s]  you come in. Yeah. Is that DMCA? I'm scared. Oh, was that? No, no, no. I don't think this is
[636.06s -> 641.75s]  DMCA. I'm sure it's fine. No, yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Okay. Audio jungle. It is?
[642.79s -> 653.94s]  No, I'm just messing around. This reminds me of the DMC five van. What is going on? Yeah. Then
[653.94s -> 660.02s]  where is the beeping? Uh, no, not. Oh, so drama. Do you remember the beeping when we last hunted
[660.02s -> 666.74s]  ghosts? I do. What did you figure out what it was? Yeah, it was a, it's a faulty headset that I ended
[666.74s -> 674.06s]  up EQing out. It's a long story, but it is, but you actually had a broken headset. My VR headset
[674.06s -> 679.42s]  was broken and came with bleeps. That was, that's weird that it did. You would, you're echoing now.
[679.42s -> 686.97s]  That was weird. In proximity. We're all like, I think it's ambiance. Every time you turn your
[686.97s -> 691.85s]  head, I stopped being able to hear you well. Like it's just, that's, we have to face each other
[691.85s -> 698.17s]  when we talk. Yeah, we have to face each other. Look at me in the eye. Does anyone of you spin
[698.17s -> 705.64s]  while holding down a note? We have to make eye contact. All right, let's do this. Let, let us,
[705.64s -> 713.19s]  let us hunt well. We have to be so close. Let us hunt fiercely. Yeah. All right. It's the rep.
[713.19s -> 723.59s]  Use, uh, remember your buddy system. It's the Tyrannosaurus. It's the deer. So wait, is there a,
[723.59s -> 728.63s]  should we not shoot anything? Should we, is there a downfall to do that? There doesn't seem to be a
[728.63s -> 733.91s]  penalty to, you know, we can, we can hit whatever we want. Like I'm going to hit Jupiter right now
[733.91s -> 745.67s]  because fuck Jupiter. There might be a planet. Is there a ghost in here? There's definitely a ghost.
[745.67s -> 754.18s]  If you are a ghost, say hi. Uh, guys, I don't think they're fucking in here. I was doing,
[754.18s -> 768.84s]  I was doing global. We agreed. We're going to do only global to start. And if it sucks,
[768.84s -> 772.76s]  we don't do it anymore. Oh, okay. I get you. I've been doing proximity the whole time.
[774.38s -> 778.62s]  Okay. Let's, yeah. Well, I'm sorry. Yes. Proximity we'll be doing. Yes. I think it's more fun.
[778.62s -> 786.26s]  That's in a weird space. That's in a weird place right there. Oh, where'd he go? Where'd he go?
[786.58s -> 792.90s]  What was it? What was it? I don't know, but it was, it was this thing. He's gone.
[793.70s -> 798.18s]  There's another duck. Yo, I just like duck. No. Whoa. Whoa. Did I not have shot the duck?
[798.82s -> 809.34s]  What happened? Was that, was it a ghost? I think that's a glitch, but okay. That's a video game
[809.34s -> 822.46s]  ghost technically. Yeah. This, I can't wait to be the ghost. Oh shit. Uh, uh, I'm going to go down a
[822.46s -> 831.59s]  ground floor. Oh, I think Vinny. Where are they? I think they're reading in this room.
[832.15s -> 837.30s]  Oh, that's right. We have a, uh, a reader. I forgot about that. How do you pull up the reader?
[839.40s -> 843.72s]  Uh, you gotta have it in your inventory and it's pressing number two on the, oh shit. Okay.
[846.66s -> 851.94s]  Oh, I thought that was just a bug. Oh, what was it? Oh, there's somebody right here. It was,
[852.02s -> 860.82s]  it was fucking Ross. Ross ghost. What? What? Why is he standing still? I got a vacuum here.
[861.62s -> 871.50s]  Okay. Great. Nice. Why would you just stand in there? Did he DC? I think he's, he didn't know.
[871.50s -> 878.07s]  I heard him though. See, since we're all doing, uh, proximity, Oh God. Yeah. Proximity is global.
[878.07s -> 883.59s]  So if, since we're all present, we give each other's positions away. Oh, it's kind of fun though.
[884.71s -> 885.91s]  Yeah. You guys see any,
[887.99s -> 896.44s]  Whoa, any ghosts around? I'm just friendly space, man.
[900.06s -> 905.50s]  That's a personal jelly. I was so focused on the reader that I didn't know you guys
[905.50s -> 908.30s]  were shooting a space, man. It's literally one minute to midnight. What's that mean?
[909.02s -> 914.84s]  What's that mean? Uh, at midnight? They can kill us at midnight. All right.
[916.40s -> 923.14s]  Into a vacuum can come back and still kill us, but they're weakened. I got a defib so I can oh well
[923.14s -> 925.14s]  I shouldn't have said that because then they'll single me out
[925.74s -> 927.86s]  Does anyone need help? I have a health kit. I
[929.08s -> 940.20s]  Think I think we're pretty good. There's only what two more. I'm going up. Oh, yeah. Oh you're one of these pots, okay?
[943.56s -> 945.56s]  That's what I would do
[945.60s -> 954.99s]  Really? I would have gone to one of those pots. So in 17 seconds, they're gonna attack us
[955.51s -> 961.71s]  Don't they build up a negative attribute if they stay still?
[964.38s -> 971.14s]  Yeah, Jerma, they build up ectoplasm and then they become more
[972.26s -> 974.70s]  Easily discoverable. All right, they still yeah
[975.18s -> 980.74s]  We we should probably stick actually maybe not stick together because then they'll kill us easier in group. Oh, yeah, we should
[981.74s -> 985.32s]  Oh my god, that was fast
[986.67s -> 989.71s]  Why is this what is the mammoth? Oh
[991.69s -> 996.36s]  My god
[996.40s -> 999.54s]  Nice good
[1000.86s -> 1003.22s]  There is
[1005.78s -> 1008.08s]  Jolly
[1008.08s -> 1022.74s]  God damn it plant. I can't we kill this I
[1025.40s -> 1035.56s]  Got him we do it. Yeah, it's just one. It's one left criken now one one. Yes, right
[1036.20s -> 1038.20s]  Right here plant plant plant
[1038.40s -> 1043.07s]  photo synthesize this oh
[1045.27s -> 1046.63s]  Yeah
[1046.63s -> 1054.52s]  Sorry, I'm good. I just got a way too excited. I'm so I'm out my parts beating. Oh look at us. So cool
[1055.32s -> 1057.68s]  Yeah, why oh man that's we look like
[1058.32s -> 1059.76s]  bootleg pyro
[1059.76s -> 1064.86s]  Like it's like a flash mob. Imagine being that excited
[1065.46s -> 1071.06s]  That excited over like the totally care about in this cheap pop ripoff. I leveled up
[1071.62s -> 1074.12s]  You suck is the first game relax
[1074.46s -> 1079.57s]  All right. Um, let's keep this team one more time and then we'll find out how to shuffle
[1080.37s -> 1084.19s]  Sure. Also remember when you're a ghost if you need to leave
[1084.71s -> 1095.99s]  That was very important info that we did not just get that was sounded important. All right, what do we got phantom?
[1097.20s -> 1100.36s]  Spirit I think I like this one this one
[1101.08s -> 1102.88s]  chill
[1102.88s -> 1104.88s]  See hunters through walls, sir
[1104.92s -> 1109.26s]  Okay, cool. What should I go? What should I go in?
[1109.82s -> 1119.29s]  Rock it out. Yep. I guess for this one probably shouldn't use the
[1120.09s -> 1134.38s]  What's the place where this wouldn't be? I have to build a scene. Yeah, I got to build a scene
[1134.38s -> 1137.65s]  How do I get out? How do I get out of here?
[1158.66s -> 1164.40s]  The proximity chat is so fucking low. I can barely hear you dude. It's it's yeah, it's very far
[1164.92s -> 1171.20s]  Like it's like impossible to hear you. So but yeah, I'm gonna I'm using that too
[1171.28s -> 1179.11s]  We all just gonna be the animals over here wait, I shouldn't say that out loud fuck no
[1179.11s -> 1184.24s]  I think you're okay cuz you're using the team speak. Am I I'm holding Q. Yeah, Q is team speak
[1185.60s -> 1193.84s]  All right. Listen, I'm gonna corrupt these pigs. Oh my god. I'm so stupid. I walked right into their base
[1193.90s -> 1197.42s]  Should we both be sitting here at the same time Liam? Maybe I should move should I move?
[1198.38s -> 1204.18s]  No, maybe I should move. I don't know. I'm smaller. I'm smaller. I'm smaller. I don't know, but you're a bigger talk
[1204.30s -> 1210.12s]  I'll move I'll move common courtesy. Okay, be careful. Be careful. I'm so concerned
[1211.75s -> 1217.27s]  All right. I've corrupted the pigs. So now if the hunters like attack them, they'll get like damaged
[1217.27s -> 1226.47s]  I don't belong where I'm building up. Okay. Oh, what's the deal with the generator? Do we do anything with that?
[1226.71s -> 1230.77s]  That's where the hunters resupply
[1233.20s -> 1237.29s]  Okay shit
[1237.45s -> 1249.61s]  Down I
[1249.61s -> 1255.22s]  Wish I could fucking say anything hold R. Yeah, I know you can or you can orient yourself, right?
[1255.46s -> 1261.68s]  But I need to move don't I when do they come out? Oh
[1266.36s -> 1269.25s]  Here we go. I gotta clear the
[1269.85s -> 1276.04s]  When do they come out? When do they actually start to come out? They they're they've been out. They just haven't been anywhere around here
[1276.04s -> 1280.85s]  Yeah, Oh
[1280.85s -> 1283.63s]  Scared this shit out of me. Just just role-playing
[1284.17s -> 1301.14s]  That scared the shit out of me too. Why am I so jumpy right now? Are they I don't like this
[1301.62s -> 1312.00s]  Should I go on the plant? I feel like I could hide that. Why am I a gigantic target?
[1312.48s -> 1321.38s]  Hey, oh that oh, okay. Good. Just make sure that was you. Yeah, I'm just
[1322.14s -> 1327.57s]  Role-playing as a duck right now. What happens if you get to red ectoplasm? Oh
[1330.61s -> 1335.33s]  Red ectoplasm means that their instruments can detect you very easily. So you got to like
[1335.85s -> 1340.13s]  Jump out of like jump around or jump out into different crops
[1352.92s -> 1356.40s]  Oh, that's a ghost that's a ghost right here right here
[1363.44s -> 1364.60s]  I
[1364.60s -> 1370.13s]  Don't get it. I don't I don't know what happened back. I don't get it
[1370.13s -> 1374.45s]  I don't know the head spectral or I don't know the spectrum. Are you bullshit? Did you get sucked up?
[1374.45s -> 1378.73s]  I got sucked up. No, you got sucked up. I had the ectoplasm. Okay
[1378.73s -> 1385.18s]  All right, if you survive, you can come back if we survived. All right, cool. Cool. Cool. I
[1385.82s -> 1393.15s]  Didn't understand the ectoplasm. Oh my god. My corruption is detonated. I would have stayed put
[1394.15s -> 1398.35s]  And I'd they're all downstairs wait you wait
[1403.54s -> 1409.50s]  Like blocking their way crash I was on the but I was at the bottom of the staircase Oh long way
[1409.50s -> 1411.50s]  Well, I'm walking their exit
[1411.74s -> 1415.94s]  Chasing me, but I'm back now. I freaked out cuz it was had a red ectoplasm. Whatever
[1417.02s -> 1422.54s]  If they come upstairs, let me know I can like just jump downstairs. This is kind of fun, though
[1422.70s -> 1428.20s]  I'm just trying to clear my ectoplasm, but I don't see them near you
[1428.64s -> 1434.35s]  She says I walked into him. I'm an idiot
[1435.81s -> 1438.37s]  Germa is in the same room as you but yeah, they they don't yeah
[1438.61s -> 1443.69s]  So what I can go look that is that cheating you you can you can cut fuck with them a little bit right now
[1443.69s -> 1448.81s]  Germa you're dead, but you have an ability. I think you can freeze them a little they're coming up to you any coal
[1449.45s -> 1453.50s]  Yeah, you'll never they'll never know if you want. I'll never know. I'll never know
[1453.50s -> 1456.22s]  She's got him
[1459.02s -> 1466.81s]  Children is it really down to me again? Oh jeez not yet. Oh my god
[1471.28s -> 1474.68s]  Don't worry guys, they're not gonna kill me in nine minutes. Oh, we good
[1475.28s -> 1480.17s]  Now we come back and we gotta kill her. I will be dead in three seconds
[1480.93s -> 1482.93s]  Suck him harder
[1514.26s -> 1517.90s]  All right nice job mammoth tusk wins
[1522.54s -> 1528.50s]  Three ghosts destroyed three hunters knocked out. Well nice work. I'm starting to get it
[1532.84s -> 1535.04s]  Okay, cool. All right, great. Yeah. No, yeah
[1537.48s -> 1542.12s]  Hopefully I think we get a new map now and I think maybe it'll scramble the teams if not we can do a
[1542.68s -> 1544.99s]  You will scramble. Yeah, whatever
[1545.07s -> 1549.85s]  Whatever works true true after whatever you got absolutely carried
[1550.37s -> 1555.19s]  Stop rocking back and forth. You look old. I'm rocking. Wait, what do you mean like this?
[1555.85s -> 1557.85s]  That's it. I don't know. It's just fun to do
[1557.89s -> 1564.57s]  All right, let me see this other stuff here. I have 1600 credit
[1567.72s -> 1578.15s]  All it replaces that I think I'll try it I want to try this thing and
[1579.87s -> 1581.87s]  Giving us the same team teams
[1581.95s -> 1586.48s]  Well, you want you want to do like three or four matches in a row at the same teams and then three or four
[1586.48s -> 1588.48s]  You know, I'm saying change it back to three or four or something
[1588.64s -> 1590.64s]  Okay. Yeah, that sounds good
[1590.84s -> 1593.84s]  I'm down for whatever this one
[1593.88s -> 1602.52s]  German, what's your chin exercise routine? Look up at the sky like this and you want to put your
[1603.28s -> 1607.00s]  like this and one two three
[1609.44s -> 1611.44s]  I'm gonna assume this is a DMCA
[1613.60s -> 1615.56s]  You go up with your job
[1615.56s -> 1618.36s]  No, also another one. Another good one is
[1619.40s -> 1625.20s]  Is that even real though? It probably sounds close enough to another song to get DMC aid
[1625.80s -> 1630.27s]  So that can happen. I mean I have like
[1630.63s -> 1636.87s]  6,000 or so videos on my full sauce channel and every day something new is getting claimed that that makes zero sense
[1637.59s -> 1639.96s]  Yeah, it's it's it's kind of crazy
[1640.64s -> 1643.85s]  Dude, I had crickets. I played the sound effect of crickets
[1643.85s -> 1648.85s]  Not like because I made a bad joke and the crickets got claimed. It's the funny face guy
[1650.05s -> 1661.16s]  That's unreal. Yeah. All right. So now that we who dared to claim that probably cricket
[1665.57s -> 1667.77s]  It was criken on behalf of crickets
[1669.25s -> 1673.37s]  All right, the ghost meter is actually pretty I would say like required
[1673.93s -> 1679.40s]  Yeah, I would yeah as long as what does anybody have a
[1680.16s -> 1684.80s]  Vacuum, I think we need at least one person with a vacuum, right? Oh, okay. I've defected
[1686.32s -> 1690.08s]  Just just look at all with your exercise. How hard are you doing that?
[1690.08s -> 1693.36s]  I got a ghost over here guys just warm up on me if you want to kill it
[1693.36s -> 1698.72s]  I'm making like a just don't don't let on that. You know, the ghost is there. Okay, never mind. What are you talking about? I
[1699.52s -> 1704.22s]  Didn't say yeah one into your room to the other while you like put your chin out
[1704.22s -> 1718.40s]  I said literally go like this. So technically the game is on right now and then we are like looking for them right now
[1718.40s -> 1723.44s]  It's not like a like a minute. Yeah. Yeah, this is as soon as the hunters join in it's on. Okay, cool
[1723.44s -> 1732.11s]  I'm on Ross's tail right now. He's a box. Oh, where'd he go was?
[1733.30s -> 1741.56s]  Now I see I'm so close picked up something over here over here picked up something over here. Okay, I have my ghost rail
[1741.56s -> 1746.28s]  Oh, yeah, there's there we got some activity in this room. Yeah, there is activity. There is activity. Oh
[1755.11s -> 1758.30s]  No idea what I'm doing. Hey ghosts
[1761.04s -> 1777.34s]  A little bit of activity over here. Wait, there's somebody in this room. Never mind up, dude
[1778.02s -> 1787.03s]  Got him in the room. He's a box. He's a studio stereo equipment box on it. Okay
[1791.23s -> 1795.55s]  Wait, what where do you go? What do you go? He's too quickly. What happened? Where'd he go?
[1798.04s -> 1813.08s]  Where did he go? Where'd he go? I don't know where he is, but he's here
[1813.68s -> 1815.68s]  This thing is so slow to shoot
[1815.92s -> 1823.30s]  Yeah, I thought I'd like the machine gun thing, but I don't
[1823.82s -> 1831.45s]  Well, I gotta go to resupply. Hold on. This thing is poop. Can I go up the ladder?
[1831.97s -> 1841.94s]  There's somebody literally right here the lantern
[1858.04s -> 1864.10s]  I'm not getting any readings. No, I think we got we just absolutely we got been had we got played big-time
[1868.44s -> 1876.68s]  Here I
[1877.28s -> 1880.64s]  Think I think he escaped
[1880.68s -> 1884.52s]  Damn it. Oh, he's right here. He's like he's literally in this room
[1884.52s -> 1889.84s]  He has to be the rate of the mark. The market is nothing market. It's not like a stock. It's going wild right now
[1891.52s -> 1913.70s]  What oh god right here somebody right here right here has to be right here
[1917.51s -> 1919.51s]  Good call good call
[1923.03s -> 1927.27s]  Jolly jolly, do we all have the melee weapon? Does anybody have a gun?
[1930.23s -> 1932.23s]  Damage
[1933.92s -> 1935.92s]  Shotgun I've ever charged
[1936.24s -> 1937.77s]  Gotcha
[1937.77s -> 1947.08s]  There's a fake me running around is that I it's dead now. Oh, it's midnight. Well, here we go right here
[1948.20s -> 1950.92s]  Criken is a pot our father who art in heaven
[1951.92s -> 1953.76s]  hallowed be thy name
[1953.76s -> 1955.76s]  Thy kingdom come will be done
[1956.60s -> 1959.16s]  heaven oh
[1960.94s -> 1962.94s]  God god
[1963.50s -> 1966.46s]  Dude, I'd love to revive you guys, but uh
[1967.70s -> 1973.62s]  Okay, this is in Christ. We have failed that melee weapon sucks
[1974.34s -> 1976.66s]  Yeah, yeah, I'm not using that anymore
[1977.34s -> 1980.26s]  So many of these weapons are like kind of
[1980.86s -> 1982.22s]  truce
[1982.22s -> 1986.21s]  Half of us are using the the little like a light stick
[1986.81s -> 2001.48s]  Need to level up arcane. I feel like yeah, it's like the combine weapon from half-life to it kind of is you know
[2001.92s -> 2014.32s]  Who's still alive? I am I'm just booking it. I'm just trying to like outlast. I guess I don't know what to do
[2014.32s -> 2018.40s]  I'm literally watching me when I asked that question for some reason. I thought that you were
[2019.04s -> 2028.20s]  Don't know why I thought it was a ghost. I thought we were ghosts for one second. Oh my god. Oh my god
[2029.00s -> 2034.28s]  Is this working out? They're just chasing you. I think I mean it's working, but there's
[2034.80s -> 2036.00s]  Yeah
[2036.00s -> 2039.55s]  I'm gonna play the wrestling game tomorrow. Should I just take the L?
[2040.59s -> 2044.59s]  You can do whatever you think is correct my brother and Geist
[2045.68s -> 2047.92s]  Perform an accelerated back off through the theater
[2048.44s -> 2052.16s]  Book it to the next QPU
[2052.20s -> 2058.70s]  Yeah, I will but what is that? This is what you see in Mario said in Mario 64
[2059.66s -> 2064.82s]  QPUs are positional universes fucking so that we need to talk about parallel universes
[2065.66s -> 2071.15s]  Why can they not get you does anybody do they have them a move? They're just running behind
[2072.27s -> 2075.40s]  Yeah, all right ghost moves, right?
[2081.54s -> 2088.32s]  Yeah, go team chair
[2089.68s -> 2096.60s]  The chair when oh my god ghost after this next round when the next map is about to happen
[2096.60s -> 2100.52s]  I'm gonna exit and we can all join a new lobby and we'll go into new teams
[2101.08s -> 2110.47s]  All right, I get it. I like I want to hide more now that I understand how it works. Nice straw. Sorry. I'm a very loud
[2110.99s -> 2117.27s]  No, but you're okay. No, you're good. It's a straw. Is there a problem with straws?
[2117.91s -> 2128.10s]  Buddy, why is your steam profile picture alone in the dark? I don't know. I haven't changed it since like
[2128.90s -> 2133.02s]  2013 or something. I don't know. Okay. This is important
[2134.73s -> 2142.86s]  Remotely charge up objects looks like a ghost charging up. I'm gonna try that. Are we playing this game?
[2142.86s -> 2150.60s]  Are we backing out? Yeah, we're doing this one. Yeah when it changes to the next map all ghosts
[2150.60s -> 2158.28s]  But then I'll make a new server random sound I found the ability that lets you create false radar readings. That'll be good
[2158.68s -> 2160.92s]  That's probably what was happening with us that whole time
[2161.48s -> 2162.80s]  Yeah
[2162.80s -> 2164.80s]  Apparently you can throw your voice
[2164.80s -> 2169.18s]  All you have to do is aim hold left shift and press C and talk
[2169.18s -> 2175.33s]  So like somebody's throw my voice like she says tell me if you can hear me in proximity
[2175.89s -> 2181.12s]  Okay, I did
[2182.44s -> 2188.96s]  Something really small. Yeah, I'm really far away from you. I just threw my voice to you. Yes. Oh, that's cool
[2188.96s -> 2193.75s]  I think I'm gonna go sit. I think I'm gonna go sit in one of those chairs
[2194.27s -> 2207.34s]  You do that. They'll never know if we find more buckets we can put them in chairs. This is too obvious
[2207.34s -> 2213.28s]  I don't think they're gonna look over here. Who's the piano? Can you just jump?
[2214.94s -> 2230.60s]  Yeah, you can fuck do your piano the Mario 64 piano I need to lean forward like the other ones are
[2230.80s -> 2239.28s]  That was probably a terrible idea. I don't know. I did that scan occasion. I didn't get it. I got the defense
[2239.28s -> 2243.10s]  Oh, no, did not about the scanner. No
[2244.46s -> 2246.46s]  They didn't get the scanner
[2260.86s -> 2262.86s]  They're far away I'm gonna go this way
[2262.86s -> 2267.72s]  I mean ghost hunters. I'm a ghost, of course. I'm gonna go this way
[2268.60s -> 2277.18s]  Something so humorous about German Tokyo drifting through the door there
[2279.26s -> 2308.28s]  Chair, oh man, okay. I get I can fake them out
[2308.84s -> 2323.34s]  Stop moving. I have to look at the ectoplasm buildup. I have to move I can revive
[2325.06s -> 2334.59s]  They're teabagging my shards
[2334.83s -> 2346.83s]  They're all in the first floor. Nope. There's one up top basically. Oh, yeah one just walked by Vinny
[2347.11s -> 2351.59s]  Oh
[2355.08s -> 2357.08s]  I'm watching this from up here
[2357.20s -> 2378.82s]  I'm trying to clear the buildup. Wow. Wow. I cannot believe that just happened. What happened? Oh, I just missed it
[2379.22s -> 2384.22s]  Why would there be a ladder here? It was already looking for Vinny and Vinny just kind of booked it over the balcony
[2384.22s -> 2390.02s]  Oh great. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I had like a gamer moment. I can't believe it. Well, not that kind of one
[2390.02s -> 2393.06s]  But I'm gonna save that for you so you can get a third-person perspective
[2393.66s -> 2399.99s]  Do you guys remember Iced for GameCube I do remember Geist that's what this is multiplayer Geist
[2402.04s -> 2404.88s]  It was on what happened recently Geist. Oh
[2407.61s -> 2417.30s]  Great show and yeah, I haven't been able to forget about it since playing this. Yeah. Oh man that game was okay
[2419.46s -> 2421.46s]  The very okay is game
[2431.41s -> 2433.41s]  I'm like a trampoline
[2434.85s -> 2439.65s]  I don't understand. It's too stressful. It's too stressful
[2463.68s -> 2469.68s]  I can't do it. I can't fucking do this. That's too stressful. This is too stressful. It's I'll I can't it's too stressed
[2469.68s -> 2473.76s]  I'm gonna lose it. Nice, you know, I don't I don't get it. I don't it's like I freak out
[2473.76s -> 2483.02s]  I think they can see me at all fucking sides. I think it's like too stressful
[2483.74s -> 2489.98s]  Yes, Vinny keep distracting. Oh, I don't know. I feel like they can see me
[2490.42s -> 2498.66s]  I'm just gonna keep jumping as a cat. Are you lying bagging my ghost corpse?
[2498.66s -> 2511.89s]  I think they'll laugh. So I think they lagged out now. Are they lagging or just tea bagging aggressively?
[2516.65s -> 2518.65s]  It's time
[2527.50s -> 2538.50s]  I'm a couch. It's time for you to pay
[2539.02s -> 2543.11s]  Yeah, I probably I should I shouldn't like
[2543.59s -> 2549.95s]  Yeeted myself down the stairs, but I don't know. I love to play these games. I don't know what like what it looks like
[2559.78s -> 2576.34s]  Fuck no
[2576.34s -> 2578.34s]  I'm trying I'm trying to hit him
[2579.02s -> 2581.42s]  We can if you yeah. Yeah, there you go
[2582.48s -> 2606.46s]  Good just various objects. Yeah like that. Good job. Oh
[2614.20s -> 2631.85s]  Come here
[2632.49s -> 2635.82s]  I
[2636.74s -> 2639.69s]  Almost got it. I'm trying
[2642.64s -> 2649.04s]  Ghosts if you want more speed you have to possess an object and right-click hold it and then you can like start
[2649.40s -> 2651.12s]  What are you doing?
[2651.12s -> 2655.28s]  Did you just like suck the ectoplasm out of that corpse? Yes
[2656.22s -> 2662.28s]  That's normal
[2662.40s -> 2667.54s]  Got it. I wish I would have seen that kill. Yeah
[2667.94s -> 2672.29s]  Yeah
[2672.89s -> 2674.89s]  Team chair, all right
[2675.81s -> 2682.01s]  Let's see how well you do teams with 12 minutes in a game in a genre that you've never played before
[2682.25s -> 2688.57s]  In a space that you've never been in before in a area that you've never seen before
[2689.33s -> 2695.27s]  You understand that I'm trying. Okay, relax. Relax. Everything's fine
[2695.71s -> 2715.60s]  Use a fee. No, I'm just kidding. I don't know. I never played prop on ever
[2715.60s -> 2721.21s]  I know this has been around for like alright, this is like I've never played a game
[2721.21s -> 2734.42s]  This is like never playing a game of Call of Duty in your whole life. Hey, I just I just solidified that game right there
[2734.42s -> 2744.71s]  I got the last kill. I think I did pretty good
[2745.27s -> 2752.18s]  Never played TF2 pro. No, I was always like a super contrarian and
[2752.66s -> 2757.06s]  Didn't want to play prop on because it was so popular that I was like, nah, it's not me. I'm not playing that
[2757.50s -> 2773.12s]  It's a popular thing I got a new code I was very much aware of his existence
[2773.96s -> 2780.58s]  You're a hipster. Yeah, you say that that's fine
[2780.98s -> 2791.95s]  You're in your right to say that is the guy who played Elden Ring 15 times in a row
[2791.95s -> 2800.96s]  What does that have to do with anything? Wait, I think maybe I did I play you a video of TF2 prop hunt. I'm pretty sure
[2803.83s -> 2811.90s]  Yeah, but like I don't it was like that was like eight years ago. I played it once I
[2813.69s -> 2820.01s]  Yeah, sorry, I forgot that I played TF2 prop hunt like nine years ago one time
[2822.27s -> 2824.07s]  What do you say?
[2824.07s -> 2826.47s]  How am I supposed? I don't know. I don't remember
[2827.23s -> 2837.54s]  You tell me what you had for breakfast two weeks ago. I bet you would you ever okay?
[2837.54s -> 2839.54s]  What did you have for breakfast on?
[2840.14s -> 2842.14s]  April 2nd
[2842.98s -> 2849.62s]  2022 what did you eat for breakfast? Do you fucking even know? No, you can
[2850.02s -> 2857.60s]  Dude, it was nine like eight or nine years ago, and I probably dude. It was I probably forgot it immediately after it happened
[2858.44s -> 2865.98s]  That's so funny, but what's a different game? This is completely different
[2866.58s -> 2868.95s]  Who knew how team can you hear me?
[2869.23s -> 2873.46s]  Are we on the same piece?
[2873.46s -> 2879.06s]  Yeah, it looks like only one person difference. We just we have Jolly now. We traded for Jolly
[2880.32s -> 2882.89s]  No, it's really not
[2882.89s -> 2888.17s]  It's weird because seriously, I can't find a way to randomize or change teams
[2888.49s -> 2891.01s]  Between people it seems like that just isn't an option
[2894.05s -> 2902.99s]  Hey, what did you guys have for breakfast nine years ago nine years ago to the day bacon egg and cheese almost guaranteed guaranteed
[2904.13s -> 2906.78s]  almost
[2906.78s -> 2909.38s]  Currently going back and forth with chat about a few things
[2911.62s -> 2913.62s]  Okay, sorry that took me off guard
[2916.47s -> 2929.20s]  Probably honey nut Cheerios, I mean lately this not that this is in any way relevant to the question that Jerma had asked
[2929.36s -> 2931.79s]  but lately
[2931.79s -> 2937.39s]  It's been bagel Vinny just shot Jerma's bit to bits. Did I ruin your bit Jerma? No ever?
[2937.39s -> 2942.43s]  Okay, so everyone's everyone's yelling at me over here because they're like, how do you not know how to play prop hunt?
[2942.43s -> 2948.11s]  And I was like, dude, I've never played prop on right somebody pulled out. We watch somebody pulled out an old video from like
[2948.87s -> 2950.97s]  2013 I was gonna say
[2951.47s -> 2955.73s]  Yeah, I don't know. I don't think they did laying. I don't remember playing prop hunt
[2955.73s -> 2958.21s]  So I'm like, what'd you have for breakfast two weeks ago on April 2nd?
[2958.97s -> 2964.40s]  Also crying bit if you play game
[2970.62s -> 2974.38s]  Wait the match already started he saw it he saw it
[2975.58s -> 2979.04s]  Does anyone have a vacuum? Yeah
[2982.36s -> 2986.94s]  So all me I just randomly shot a duck, okay guys
[2986.94s -> 2993.54s]  I just randomly shot that duck because I thought it would be funny and it was cracking dude shoot fucking everything
[2993.78s -> 2997.34s]  There's no downside wrecking. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, there isn't
[2998.14s -> 3004.40s]  Which makes no sense because usually there's like a risk reward
[3005.32s -> 3007.32s]  Yeah
[3007.68s -> 3012.40s]  Breakfast nine years ago and suddenly criken is dead. I feel a chill
[3012.98s -> 3014.70s]  We've got a ghost here where I am
[3014.70s -> 3019.06s]  What do you guys have you guys played like a game like that? You don't remember playing from like ten years ago
[3019.78s -> 3022.15s]  Do you know what I played last night?
[3023.35s -> 3025.51s]  Thank you. Wait, what do you found him?
[3026.23s -> 3028.23s]  Treasure chest
[3028.23s -> 3034.45s]  Like that you don't remember playing ten years ago, but you have played it. Yeah, we're saying oh
[3036.49s -> 3039.63s]  Probably any Call of Duty game from then you know how many steam games
[3039.63s -> 3043.63s]  I probably have downloaded that that I've played like maybe 30 minutes of and went well
[3043.63s -> 3050.69s]  I don't this game sucks and then never played it again and forgot. I ever bought it guys criken is haunting me
[3051.33s -> 3054.80s]  Hmm. It's probably because you shot a duck
[3055.42s -> 3061.51s]  Sorry, criken. I thought it would be funny to shoot the duck. I'm sorry. How is this happening?
[3062.39s -> 3066.41s]  And this is well, because I'm just looking for objects that are slightly out of place
[3066.77s -> 3072.06s]  I'm playing the video game, you know in a reading
[3072.58s -> 3075.84s]  That's a lot. I didn't mean that to sound so sassy. I apologize
[3076.48s -> 3083.10s]  Dare you not talk about breakfast that you ate something right here. Look man. All I'm saying is
[3083.70s -> 3085.59s]  Well Germans getting a lot of shit for this
[3085.59s -> 3091.95s]  I literally have played mods that I've got that I played like two months. I feel like them again
[3092.95s -> 3099.62s]  I don't know that doesn't make your shit inexcusable jammer. Come on. I mean, I've played a mod of
[3100.38s -> 3104.90s]  I played prop hunt nine years ago, and I don't remember playing it
[3105.18s -> 3112.78s]  How do you but do you not remember the craze on YouTube where oh, yeah, really? Everybody played it. Oh, absolutely
[3112.78s -> 3114.78s]  I just don't remember being a part of the craze
[3115.14s -> 3120.14s]  But like surely, you know a bit of this from osmosis like absolutely
[3120.62s -> 3128.61s]  To be fair though this this is this is a lot a little more prop hunty than usual prop hunt
[3129.05s -> 3136.04s]  It's actually not not to correct you but it's less prop hunt than prop hunt. Okay
[3139.00s -> 3152.29s]  There's nothing in the boat, okay, there's nothing I just I love that he's literally being a pirate in the boat
[3152.77s -> 3154.77s]  He was taunting me before
[3154.93s -> 3160.28s]  Now are there skeleton ghosts? Are we doing squid ghosts? What do we got?
[3161.64s -> 3164.66s]  I just watched what's the Caribbean?
[3165.66s -> 3168.09s]  squid ghosts
[3169.21s -> 3179.04s]  Watch the first two why can't squids have ghosts Charlie? What is this? Well, I mean they can but I don't think they'd be particularly cerebral I
[3179.68s -> 3185.93s]  Don't think there's much going on in a squid bat brain other than eat food eat food shit eat food eat
[3185.93s -> 3190.53s]  They're very smart. They're very smart animals cephalopods man mental. I
[3191.09s -> 3194.07s]  Thought that was octopuses. I don't know any better
[3194.47s -> 3201.51s]  Don't make me feel guilty for eating squid. I love just making stuff up it. Yep. So am I but
[3202.27s -> 3209.62s]  You know, he's chilling any readings at all down here somebody something down here. I found him. I found a piece of box. Oh
[3210.14s -> 3212.14s]  shit, okay, oh
[3212.26s -> 3214.50s]  Yeah, he's something else. He's literally in this room
[3215.22s -> 3220.86s]  The salt water is corroding your suit
[3221.50s -> 3222.62s]  What?
[3222.62s -> 3224.62s]  Where the fuck is he?
[3224.74s -> 3228.40s]  He's has to be right here somewhere like literally right here
[3228.96s -> 3237.50s]  Yeah, we got strong readings down here. All right, we're about to get fucked. So stick together run
[3238.74s -> 3253.23s]  He just fucking murdered him. Oh my god. Oh, he's so low. I'm knocked out
[3258.71s -> 3262.83s]  Squids are able to count solve problems recognize patterns and communicate
[3263.51s -> 3266.64s]  Dude squids can play video games
[3267.28s -> 3275.97s]  You think squids got kind of fell out of an alien spaceship driving across the earth and fell in the ocean
[3275.97s -> 3277.85s]  Just kind of kept going. I
[3277.85s -> 3281.94s]  Mean that that sounds like a good enough theory for me
[3282.78s -> 3284.26s]  being
[3284.26s -> 3286.26s]  non biology
[3288.50s -> 3290.90s]  Fuck oh, that's all of my health. I have six
[3291.46s -> 3299.82s]  You're so low, but I have faith you got this dude. I believe in you. No, just just just yeah, buddy
[3299.82s -> 3302.82s]  So how was Pirates of the Caribbean one in two?
[3303.82s -> 3306.78s]  Very good, and I will tell you this to comfort you as you die
[3306.78s -> 3309.86s]  But I will say that I like to maybe a little bit better than one
[3310.82s -> 3317.54s]  Really? Maybe a little bit just because I like the squids. They were pretty cool incredibly incredibly relevant point
[3317.54s -> 3320.54s]  I've seen all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. I don't remember any of them
[3324.62s -> 3328.75s]  Okay, I'm cursed the black pearl is kind of a classic to me, but I
[3329.39s -> 3333.35s]  Thought dead man's chest was a little too long for its own good. I
[3334.47s -> 3339.47s]  Just got called out for having shit taste for liking the sequel like a little bit better than the first one
[3339.79s -> 3345.27s]  You I mean you could look at it like that. I mean, I mean you could Vinnie, but you're wrong. I
[3346.51s -> 3349.83s]  You know incorrect opinions are basically what I live for
[3350.67s -> 3356.75s]  There are four parts of the Caribbean movies, right? Oh shit. I'm about to fire like seven
[3360.80s -> 3366.24s]  That range was so all over the place. Oh, no, there are seven. No, there are five there are four
[3366.84s -> 3369.21s]  That feels like there are seven
[3372.29s -> 3374.29s]  Attention off to the third
[3374.33s -> 3380.52s]  That's what I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna watch the third one. I'm just gonna stop
[3381.00s -> 3383.06s]  Yeah, that was the last one that for Binsky
[3383.64s -> 3389.60s]  Directed then he went to do a Rango if you haven't seen that as a great movie. I've heard about that one. It's animated movie
[3389.96s -> 3397.08s]  Yeah, I didn't I think I've only seen two. I don't actually won the Oscar. There's so much fucking media nowadays like this so much
[3397.08s -> 3402.26s]  There's not there's only so much as one thing in our brains to be able to remember all this fucking media
[3402.30s -> 3405.94s]  Think of all the video games all the movies all the breakfasts you've had
[3406.54s -> 3414.84s]  Gemma, I just want to say I'm going from agreeing with you to maybe he has early onset Alzheimer's really real quick here
[3416.70s -> 3418.70s]  That's usually me
[3419.75s -> 3424.91s]  Like who remembers what they ate for breakfast who remembers what they did yesterday. I don't remember what I was playing yesterday
[3425.59s -> 3427.79s]  Who remembers movie? I don't remember movies
[3428.63s -> 3434.31s]  Yeah, but I mean, okay. I remember what I did yesterday, but not like eight years ago
[3436.43s -> 3439.63s]  Surviving their cheese. I was so I was one minute away
[3440.63s -> 3444.11s]  I've played so much Eldon ring in the past like I
[3445.78s -> 3453.78s]  Wanted to hear his take I wanted to hear the Eldon ring take you're getting I'm getting eviscerated, right?
[3454.54s -> 3461.11s]  Okay, I want to try it that good again
[3461.11s -> 3467.78s]  Yeah, I'm gonna try that point again is I've been playing so much Eldon ring that there's a good chance in a year
[3467.78s -> 3471.66s]  I'm not gonna remember more than the fact there were some dudes that look like foreskin
[3472.06s -> 3479.67s]  I've got that it's it's it's a huge game. There's so much to see it's just so much. There's just too much I
[3480.19s -> 3485.19s]  Can't wait for like two years from now when everybody decides to replay it at the exact same time
[3485.79s -> 3488.64s]  Yeah, what DLC you mean?
[3489.16s -> 3501.79s]  Yeah, pretty much so even though we're not playing Eldon ring right now, but any what are your builds? What's everybody's builds?
[3501.79s -> 3505.69s]  What did they run through the game? I've been doing a bunch of different things
[3505.69s -> 3509.97s]  But I do a little bit of int magic and mostly decks and like so I'm using
[3510.01s -> 3511.13s]  I
[3511.13s -> 3518.72s]  Do play blades based but bested this guy's bested for his build
[3519.00s -> 3526.69s]  All right, we just we're just gonna try all sitting in the exact same spot, huh? Oh, we're all here
[3526.69s -> 3532.60s]  Oh, yeah work good plan. No, I'm not over here. Yeah, I got a good spot. It's actually really good
[3533.08s -> 3536.66s]  Cuz I'm gonna corrupt these these crates
[3537.86s -> 3551.93s]  What does that do? I mean it crops them. I guess I got a really good plan here. So I'm just shaking off the ectoplasm
[3552.81s -> 3573.18s]  The good call I forgot about that you can press B to ding apparently the ding you can yeah, you can I think we I
[3573.46s -> 3590.52s]  Wonder if the enemy team can hear that and it like stops ectoplasm build up. Oh, that's cool. Yes
[3592.66s -> 3597.62s]  Remember to throw your voice that shift and then
[3600.56s -> 3604.21s]  Yeah
[3605.77s -> 3610.63s]  By the way, they can totally hear you going
[3611.55s -> 3613.55s]  As you're jumping up and down. Oh
[3614.51s -> 3622.33s]  Aided that does make noise. I will just have to be light-footed then. I mean, I'm a I'm a treasure chest, but
[3622.85s -> 3631.20s]  It'll work. Just ding ring the bell smash the link
[3631.88s -> 3635.08s]  subscribe
[3653.52s -> 3657.96s]  If you do 25 taunts in one game you get an achievement right here right here
[3658.60s -> 3663.98s]  My team I see him. Oh, yeah
[3664.42s -> 3666.42s]  Bouncing a crate. Oh, I can't go that way
[3667.14s -> 3670.88s]  Run German German was the one that ended up getting chased first
[3671.52s -> 3674.42s]  Yeah, and we're being complete assholes and dingy
[3678.78s -> 3681.38s]  Good harpoon. Yeah, now we got him
[3689.82s -> 3692.90s]  lads here the oh
[3696.44s -> 3699.42s]  Yeah, what button is that?
[3699.42s -> 3708.83s]  What would you would you press? I left my mark and so did Kurt Cobain
[3708.99s -> 3712.15s]  I wish I could how do I I don't want to certainly did
[3713.97s -> 3721.23s]  Here's I lost him by the way. Oh nice. Here's the problem with putting your spray paint paint down is that
[3721.67s -> 3730.59s]  It's not it's not prop. It's not prop what it's not proper because it's not like work
[3730.83s -> 3735.26s]  You know, we're giving away that we're props. You know what? Yes. Yes
[3736.14s -> 3742.57s]  Dinging in the jumping before which was totally inconspicuous. I think yeah, I think that was alright
[3742.97s -> 3745.66s]  I'm back. I just had to place my spray over there
[3746.22s -> 3753.42s]  Let me spray on the wall walk in the fucking door. By the way, hold on big brain move. Oh, no little brain move
[3754.14s -> 3788.96s]  spot
[3788.96s -> 3800.45s]  Why am I still alive?
[3800.45s -> 3803.30s]  You've been digging
[3803.30s -> 3809.07s]  Very well. Did you like my dings? It's a good round good round
[3809.07s -> 3818.50s]  I don't know how to respond to that. This is a really good round so far. Yeah
[3820.34s -> 3822.34s]  surprisingly good like I
[3825.37s -> 3832.01s]  Want to say it's not us it's them because I'm currently dinging repeatedly and the spray is right behind my head
[3832.09s -> 3834.09s]  They just don't seem to care nice
[3836.03s -> 3839.47s]  There they did there if they die, they probably had it coming
[3840.15s -> 3848.88s]  Kind of heartless, but correct. Why am I dying? What's going on?
[3850.50s -> 3856.01s]  already dead the
[3857.41s -> 3864.00s]  The seeing the hunters through the walls perk is fucking broke as shit. Where are they? I
[3864.64s -> 3872.83s]  Didn't know that was a perk. I thought that was a passive for everybody. Yeah, that that perk is in a book
[3874.62s -> 3881.61s]  We got a location on them. They're all hiding behind the at the back of the ship here the this part
[3885.61s -> 3887.05s]  Third
[3887.05s -> 3889.05s]  That also the I killed one
[3889.57s -> 3899.34s]  nice job
[3900.02s -> 3904.26s]  Salt damages ghosts. Yeah, that's some
[3904.90s -> 3909.38s]  Some I guess the boat phasmophobia. I
[3911.41s -> 3933.42s]  Don't see anyone in the boat, but on me back me the boat. We need a pence of them. Yep. Found one found one
[3934.04s -> 3939.95s]  Go to a gas can German German gas can get him. Oh damn German
[3940.55s -> 3950.01s]  Hold on damn dude. That was next round savage brain that consume its work
[3953.60s -> 3955.89s]  Only one left
[3955.89s -> 3963.92s]  So it just kind of becomes reverse hide-and-seek at the ends it kind of does yeah
[3971.60s -> 3973.88s]  Who's left is a crank? Yeah
[3975.75s -> 3976.97s]  criken
[3976.97s -> 3978.59s]  Where are you?
[3978.59s -> 3990.15s]  Probably like crouching behind something over here. I'm definitely getting that perk. Let's see through all as one
[3990.65s -> 3993.91s]  It's very he's on the top of the ship everybody
[3994.67s -> 3998.97s]  He's like I'm one of the masts. Oh my god. If I just looked up I would have seen him fucking hell
[3998.97s -> 4006.98s]  I'm an idiot. I almost made it demand your blood
[4009.76s -> 4015.81s]  Ouch still up top. Nope right here
[4018.77s -> 4026.26s]  Nice job. Good. Good. Good. Good game. This is souped-up prop on kind of is yeah
[4026.96s -> 4032.49s]  Box do you want to change up teams ready? We're gonna keep going
[4033.21s -> 4036.03s]  What do you think? I don't know. It's up to you guys
[4040.05s -> 4044.37s]  You want to shuffle again, I think it's it depends on who gets in first is the
[4045.57s -> 4047.25s]  First team I think
[4047.25s -> 4050.10s]  Okay, so let's shuffle. I'll exit this
[4050.98s -> 4061.09s]  Okay, that's fun. That's cool. That was your best game yet. Yeah, I mean I'm starting to figure it out
[4061.09s -> 4068.97s]  I definitely want that see people through Wallace thing cuz that's ridiculous. I'll put it on
[4068.97s -> 4082.61s]  I like to smash it into people you can throw your voice with shift plus C
[4083.01s -> 4089.51s]  Is that a perk or can I just can I just do that? It looks sweaty. I don't think so
[4089.93s -> 4100.95s]  I'm a little flush for some reason. I don't know why let's get in I
[4101.67s -> 4114.70s]  Want to take a good look at those perks kind of like the huntsman it kind of is yeah
[4115.34s -> 4119.75s]  Alright, let's do some loadout stuff
[4119.79s -> 4124.65s]  Alright ghost loadout this one here
[4125.25s -> 4129.90s]  See hunters through walls. Okay, I can I can unlock it. I definitely want that
[4130.50s -> 4135.35s]  Even before midnight that seems like why would you pick anything else?
[4138.09s -> 4144.09s]  Telekinesis is so good. I was able to live through that whole thing. I tricked the whole team for like a full minute
[4147.10s -> 4148.44s]  deadly
[4148.44s -> 4151.85s]  ghostly mist
[4151.85s -> 4157.10s]  Corruptor that's not bad either
[4157.58s -> 4173.75s]  Someone's a fake ghost. Oh shit. I didn't get to look. I don't know about these though
[4174.47s -> 4179.23s]  Flamethrower I mean hi Kraken. We're finally on the same team, which is nice
[4179.23s -> 4185.38s]  Oh, I don't know. I wish it was easier to like customize the teams. But
[4186.06s -> 4191.32s]  anyway, sorry about the duck incident incident
[4193.19s -> 4195.43s]  Apologize to me man. I would have done the same. I
[4196.43s -> 4200.19s]  Saw a duck I got excited man. I don't know. I just sometimes I
[4200.99s -> 4204.91s]  That was where the duck spawned though. Like I didn't even move it. I was like, this is perfect
[4204.91s -> 4207.35s]  He just fucking shot me immediately just went right in
[4208.03s -> 4215.52s]  Is the sniper any good? I probably not. Oh
[4217.09s -> 4223.97s]  You know, you know snipe a fucking box, man. That's true. They like make new songs for
[4224.81s -> 4227.29s]  like this game
[4227.29s -> 4231.64s]  Or did they like go to?
[4231.80s -> 4237.94s]  Yeah, is it is it new songs zero this might be a new song. Yeah, I haven't heard this one before must be new
[4238.98s -> 4248.78s]  This is a good one. Do you like it? It's our solo is fantastic
[4249.78s -> 4260.12s]  It's very very generic David Gilmore Pink Floyd waterlands music. It seems like adequate small talk on the way to a haunted mansion
[4261.66s -> 4268.33s]  We've been to this one yet. No. Oh, yeah. We have I think we you know what we did a practice
[4269.73s -> 4272.53s]  What?
[4273.49s -> 4275.79s]  What happened
[4276.39s -> 4279.21s]  sensitivity is way too high
[4281.09s -> 4297.47s]  Ghosts just hanging out in this it's better if you guys see a ghost, you know, I got a ghost
[4297.47s -> 4302.87s]  Where did I move that with my body? It's probably a glizzy. Yeah. Okay. All right. Hear me. I
[4303.51s -> 4307.67s]  Hate the word glizzy, but I can't stop saying it someone glizzy someone just dinged
[4308.83s -> 4311.05s]  What's the definition of the glizzy? Hello? It's Ross
[4311.95s -> 4317.29s]  A glizzy is apparently slang for a hot dog and I have no idea why this happened
[4317.77s -> 4319.77s]  Is that a New York thing or I
[4321.72s -> 4325.52s]  Think it was in I've explained this and this has come up on my stream like five days in a row
[4325.68s -> 4331.88s]  Like five streams in a row, but it apparently started as slang for a Glock in prison in like Florida
[4331.88s -> 4333.88s]  And then somehow it became slang for a hot dog
[4334.24s -> 4340.93s]  Really?

[4475.56s -> 4487.19s]  In the fire. I didn't bring my ghost detecting instrument. I should get that. I think something was just in front of me
[4487.71s -> 4503.68s]  Did I miss it? It's just where the fuck is this person?
[4504.32s -> 4511.62s]  I'm getting a candle. There's a candle on the table. There's a candle
[4518.50s -> 4526.23s]  Candles it was a candle on the table. Oh, I don't know where they went. I know I don't know. I have no idea. I don't

[4567.57s -> 4573.24s]  He was like table with sheet on it. Yeah, I was on the table
[4574.24s -> 4579.44s]  Myself yeah two seconds and then I realized yeah, two of those kills were just because you're in the lobby stuck
[4579.44s -> 4581.44s]  I don't know. How do we not?
[4581.72s -> 4588.42s]  Randomly spray you or hit you when you were on the table. It was hilarious. Honestly, I was watching you just walk over him
[4588.94s -> 4590.50s]  That's crazy
[4590.50s -> 4596.26s]  All right leveled up. I want to unlock new skin. So I don't look like
[4598.89s -> 4601.25s]  Candle was body blocking you
[4601.77s -> 4607.15s]  Have you seen arcane? What are your thoughts on the show? I think it's on the first episode
[4607.83s -> 4613.37s]  The only thing I remember from arcane was oh
[4615.03s -> 4616.95s]  the misery
[4616.95s -> 4618.95s]  Every single person is my enemy
[4619.63s -> 4622.60s]  That's all it's the only thing I know. I don't know anything else
[4626.88s -> 4632.71s]  And the song goes oh
[4635.33s -> 4638.17s]  Imagine dragons that they they have that formula down. They have that
[4638.77s -> 4645.68s]  Salt circle blocks your pet. Oh
[4645.92s -> 4646.90s]  That's good
[4646.90s -> 4657.25s]  And dude, by the way when that song comes on when I saw that intro like a warmth raises over my body
[4657.25s -> 4660.81s]  Like I'm like, it's like it's not chills, but it's like a yes. Here we go. I
[4662.36s -> 4678.37s]  Don't like this spot at all. By the way, I can what are you? You're the door
[4693.32s -> 4714.22s]  I've even moved the thing. Oh what I even moved. Ah, whatever skill issue. I was too busy like doing like

[4731.30s -> 4734.54s]  Radioactive every single person is my enemy
[4735.22s -> 4754.25s]  What's that stop? I have imagined dragons on right now
[4757.70s -> 4763.54s]  Well, I don't care. I'm not one of those banned elitist, right? I'm not gonna be like well, I

[4769.73s -> 4774.76s]  I hope you do. I don't I don't listen to music. I don't really listen to it too much
[4774.80s -> 4780.64s]  I listen to like the guerrillas albums on repeat the Lost Odyssey soundtrack on repeat
[4782.26s -> 4786.27s]  Full metal alchemist intro and outro brotherhood
[4787.21s -> 4789.01s]  Maybe like a dozen times a week
[4789.01s -> 4797.50s]  I used to be able to recite the entire attack on Titan season 2 intro until I was like I probably should stop doing this
[4797.50s -> 4820.28s]  Cuz the YouTube algorithms gonna like I think I'm like a fucking weirdo. What was that sound? I cannot hear him
[4822.68s -> 4829.10s]  Are you making fun of imagine dragons? I just told you I didn't I'm just saying like that. Those are the two songs
[4829.10s -> 4836.59s]  I know I thought I didn't make I just said that music if you have different music tastes. There's nothing wrong with it
[4836.59s -> 4843.96s]  I don't care. Okay, I feel to say people used to give me shit about liking the Venom movie. Okay, look
[4843.96s -> 4847.49s]  I you know, I do let me tell you something about why the Venom movie
[4847.49s -> 4850.93s]  I don't I don't care if you don't like the Venom it's working cracking. I thought it was funny
[4850.93s -> 4855.13s]  I thought it was just like absurd. It was awful, but it was great at the same time. Who cares
[4855.29s -> 4871.43s]  Who doesn't matter?
[4871.43s -> 4876.63s]  Nowhere in that whole thing. Did I say I hate him? We're gonna avoid the clip
[4877.56s -> 4880.88s]  Nowhere during that entire segment. Did I say the words?
[4880.88s -> 4891.46s]  I never said this hate never said this imagine dragons never said it. All I said was I just I didn't say anything
[4891.46s -> 4892.74s]  I just went oh
[4892.74s -> 4894.74s]  I'm not gonna say it again
[4894.74s -> 4904.28s]  Oh
[4910.85s -> 4914.73s]  I'm not kidding man. I really thought something's wrong with my computer. I thought something was wrong
[4930.95s -> 4935.31s]  I thought there's something in this drink. I was like what happened? What did I just take?
[4935.79s -> 4942.28s]  It's like why the drugs in my drink what's going on I was like what the fuck
[4943.00s -> 4947.60s]  Feels like the screen is wavy too. I'm just like, what's it the macho?

[4968.72s -> 4977.20s]  you know
[4977.24s -> 4983.04s]  The ghost hunt was really about the friends we made I died it wasn't so much about the actual ghost hunting
[4983.04s -> 4987.97s]  I was I was gone on the first probably five seconds
[5013.32s -> 5036.31s]  This thing's too big I'd like to dub this genre of game prop hunt with consequences. Oh

[6191.04s -> 6198.18s]  I'm happy I got Jerma to hear I got to hear Jerma do a Walter White impression
[6205.38s -> 6209.86s]  It's really easy just do Harrison Ford but say Jesse
[6212.40s -> 6215.34s]  Chewy, I mean Jesse
[6216.58s -> 6223.05s]  You got it. That was perfect
[6226.09s -> 6229.10s]  Think once for yes and none for no
[6232.18s -> 6246.24s]  Was moving is your name rubber Ross? All right, never mind. It's not Ross
[6249.08s -> 6252.65s]  Hulk says
[6253.33s -> 6255.70s]  There's somebody in the ballroom area
[6258.22s -> 6260.86s]  Okay, what the fuck I don't know
[6264.09s -> 6277.58s]  Percussion it's like oh like there's someone in the in the dance hall. Oh, he scared me
[6292.16s -> 6295.24s]  I'm trying to shoot him with the ice pellets. Well, we're all bad at this
[6295.40s -> 6297.61s]  I
[6297.61s -> 6304.34s]  Got science lab. There is a weird teleporter in here though. Oh, it's a bouncy pad
[6304.94s -> 6326.74s]  I'll see him. Yeah, she says your shit. Your shaggy voice is like unreal. Thank you. Here. Let me try one more time
[6327.06s -> 6331.29s]  Like swing scoop like we're at the prom
[6332.15s -> 6334.15s]  That's pretty good
[6342.74s -> 6345.26s]  Scrappy do and get banned. It's probably apologize
[6348.78s -> 6353.14s]  Yeah, you get banned from the server and which unfortunately it's in their rules now
[6353.74s -> 6355.74s]  Somebody's in here. Somebody's a chair or something. I
[6363.96s -> 6368.03s]  Think we have a ghost in the punch bowl. Oh, I hope we do
[6368.55s -> 6372.42s]  That's not the real cry
[6372.46s -> 6375.27s]  What what no
[6375.67s -> 6384.64s]  That was fake Kraken. I got to the first layer. Hold on
[6391.82s -> 6398.31s]  Thankfully, it's right. Oh, no a bomb in the lasagna. I am 100% being a toilet
[6398.31s -> 6404.56s]  Yeah, that wasn't Kraken that was Kraken. There's no way I'm not gonna be a toilet next room
[6404.72s -> 6411.93s]  There's no activity here at all zero zero Roger Roger
[6411.93s -> 6431.02s]  I mean my icon is Nirvana. So there's a song from Nirvana called school. Anyone know that song? Yeah. Yeah
[6431.22s -> 6434.13s]  That's this right now. So true
[6435.01s -> 6446.37s]  Interesting and I get some friends to come out of the stage, please. Oh, no, I couldn't find me squid game. Look an idiot
[6446.93s -> 6454.65s]  He's gonna be an idiot in squid game. He's a guitar guitar guitar guitar if you're
[6460.18s -> 6469.86s]  All we're gonna die. Have we tried in here?
[6470.46s -> 6473.38s]  Dude, I am such a okay. I cannot use this next time
[6473.38s -> 6476.60s]  I'm just staring at the meter and not looking at what it's pointing at
[6481.42s -> 6492.58s]  We got a ding and I I don't even trash he was trash it was Liam he was trash
[6500.38s -> 6511.81s]  Oh my god, Lois, I thought you know
[6513.17s -> 6515.69s]  Was jolly. Yeah, I just got sucks to
[6517.09s -> 6520.86s]  Damn it. Are there any weapons that are good besides the first one? I
[6523.26s -> 6525.26s]  Haven't found I haven't found one yet
[6525.54s -> 6528.54s]  Dang Liam, I thought it was jolly dinging the whole time
[6529.86s -> 6536.27s]  No, yeah, I was I was a trash can in the hallway. Well, you figured it out. Yeah, he's a shotgun
[6536.67s -> 6542.81s]  Yeah, I was and then I was a drum kit before then you walked by me a lot. I think also
[6543.39s -> 6545.82s]  my
[6545.82s -> 6549.34s]  Lads for tonight. My goal is for us to see every map at least once
[6549.34s -> 6555.80s]  So I think we I think we only have one more after this to be fit. Okay, this is probably a bad idea
[6555.80s -> 6558.04s]  But let's see what happens
[6558.84s -> 6570.29s]  Whatever people think I'm like a cringy annoying loser. Anyways, I'm going for it. This one's better
[6570.29s -> 6578.26s]  I like this actually way more I put shove hunter. Yeah to be fair someone was saying
[6579.02s -> 6582.84s]  Probably the other team
[6583.20s -> 6586.14s]  You guys don't all at the same time do a Peter Griffin impression that the kind of three
[6586.64s -> 6591.31s]  Yeah, let's do it. I think so. I think it's worth it. What are we saying? I'd love to see
[6591.65s -> 6596.09s]  Yeah, we're gonna say the same thing too. Yeah the exact same thing. Okay. What is it?
[6598.50s -> 6601.26s]  This reminds me of the time that I went to the school dance Lois
[6601.74s -> 6604.35s]  Yeah, you ready?
[6604.35s -> 6609.37s]  Yeah, and one two three this reminds me
[6614.01s -> 6621.10s]  Feel like I'm the weak link there guys, I gotta be honest. I couldn't tell because it was just a cacophony of Peters
[6622.25s -> 6627.93s]  That's like we all we all so badly wanted to make the same joke and we did it at the same time
[6627.93s -> 6632.16s]  I mean you told us yeah, but like but that's like it
[6632.44s -> 6638.08s]  Like out of context though like we all so badly wanted to make the Peter Griffin reference at the school dance
[6638.48s -> 6641.14s]  And all happen to say the same exact line
[6641.96s -> 6645.90s]  It's a very memorable quote. We could probably get Ross and his
[6646.94s -> 6653.62s]  To no don't be a guitar. That's so obvious animate it fucked. But yeah, I'm sure he would love to do that
[6654.06s -> 6660.46s]  Wait, I had not moved. I was too busy focusing on Peter Griffin
[6660.46s -> 6665.14s]  I'm the mic in the middle of the dance floor. It's not a good place to be
[6665.18s -> 6666.18s]  I mean
[6666.18s -> 6673.66s]  But the but you are an important tool of the dance without you. How would we hear the vocals? Yeah, whenever they come close
[6673.66s -> 6680.78s]  I'm gonna say um, Peter Griffin line. Okay. Remember you can throw your voice
[6681.06s -> 6685.30s]  I'm gonna throw it right behind them. They're gonna turn around and then I'll run
[6685.30s -> 6688.22s]  Yeah, how far can you throw it just as far as you can see?
[6688.82s -> 6693.08s]  Yeah, it's a little pinpoint when you do it. You hold control and see
[6693.94s -> 6699.49s]  So it's control and see what was that cool noise. It's not like Chewbacca
[6701.33s -> 6706.19s]  I hate that noise
[6720.91s -> 6726.22s]  Fucking scary
[6735.82s -> 6737.82s]  What you think of a bowl of Cheetos
[6756.94s -> 6805.23s]  Screw damn I'm a big man. Yeah, this is ghost Peter Griffin. Yeah, I'm staying right here you Stewie
[6805.55s -> 6823.73s]  You're not throwing it shift and see look. I can see it over there. That's what I'm doing the whole time
[6823.73s -> 6839.16s]  Look, you can see the indicator just see as I'm doing we're doing the whole time. This is now just spooky family guy
[6839.26s -> 6845.67s]  I'm over here. I'm over here here here. I'm over here here here
[6870.66s -> 6894.60s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[6896.85s -> 6900.21s]  I feel like I have the best hiding spot. Like I haven't seen anybody come over here
[6901.73s -> 6905.57s]  They all just like hanging out in the uh, the actual dance hall. No, no, no, no, no
[6931.41s -> 6933.49s]  Snake have you ever heard of the diaper chief?
[6946.85s -> 6948.85s]  I need to live I need to live
[6951.41s -> 6962.66s]  Come on you can't come on you fucking consumerists
[6973.01s -> 6974.86s]  C4
[6974.86s -> 6977.95s]  I got insta killed
[6977.95s -> 6982.14s]  I got one
[6982.14s -> 6984.38s]  Uh, it's just me. I forgot you can attack fuck
[6986.74s -> 6988.74s]  Why is it consumerists? I don't know
[6991.52s -> 6994.88s]  It's crazy to me. You can survive the entire round and then die in one hit
[6995.60s -> 6997.60s]  Yeah
[6999.76s -> 7005.04s]  I gotta I gotta remember to actually attack with right click. I've been trying i've been headshotting people with the furniture
[7006.48s -> 7008.48s]  I got
[7009.12s -> 7012.64s]  Yeah, and also in some ways less risky because you're going fast
[7019.42s -> 7021.60s]  Diaper chief stop it
[7022.00s -> 7024.86s]  How do you get that pose?
[7024.86s -> 7027.30s]  It's an emote
[7027.46s -> 7029.46s]  I don't know. It's a it's a victory pose
[7029.78s -> 7036.98s]  I don't know almost killed me with the sheer forces and launch. That was pretty cool. Yeah, you had 10 health left, right?
[7037.86s -> 7042.50s]  Let us exit the server and do one more map perhaps with one more change of team
[7042.98s -> 7047.70s]  All right, should we should we change the join order? Because that seems to be what the uh teams are
[7047.70s -> 7050.82s]  Yeah, let's try that. We can organize it we can like decide who goes
[7050.82s -> 7053.60s]  What?
[7053.60s -> 7057.34s]  consumerist
[7057.34s -> 7060.62s]  I don't know. We're like in all these objects like basketballs and like
[7062.22s -> 7064.62s]  Like keyboards and like computers. I don't know
[7065.10s -> 7070.08s]  I figured it'd be like what the fuck is he talking about? Like they're running around chasing this ghost who is a chair
[7070.64s -> 7072.64s]  And he's like you fucking consumerist. It's like
[7073.20s -> 7076.27s]  What are you talking about? What does that have to do with anything?
[7086.80s -> 7088.56s]  You're an object
[7088.56s -> 7090.56s]  Yeah, I know i'm like a piano
[7090.80s -> 7093.81s]  He's so high
[7094.05s -> 7107.47s]  You keep talking in team chat
[7107.47s -> 7110.03s]  Oh, that was the time that I played golf
[7111.30s -> 7117.06s]  This is fun. This is fun
[7117.06s -> 7121.06s]  Yeah, I was throwing my voice. I was throwing it all I that that was a really good round during the hiding phase
[7121.86s -> 7136.69s]  I think we're gonna wait till a couple people join so the teams are more scrambled
[7137.33s -> 7142.26s]  I think he's actually high. I'm I'm not i'm just having a good time
[7156.02s -> 7158.02s]  Don't ever bet on germa's team. We've won a few
[7159.06s -> 7175.15s]  All right, i'm gonna join now and joining. Oh that lobby doesn't exist
[7175.87s -> 7185.92s]  What are the animes that you've watched? I like the kind of mainstream ones attack on titan full metal alchemist

[7193.60s -> 7195.20s]  Jujutsu kaisen
[7195.20s -> 7208.96s]  Although I don't think it finished that one. I've not seen jojo. No, that's pretty much it though
[7209.92s -> 7213.18s]  I've seen berserk a long time ago
[7213.18s -> 7215.18s]  What about mog? I don't think it's an anime

[7247.02s -> 7253.73s]  I've seen the final scene of evangelion. That's it though. Maybe I randomly like on adult swim if it used to play
[7254.37s -> 7259.63s]  Okay, here we go
[7259.63s -> 7264.83s]  Please watch mob psycho. I don't have like a plan. I don't really have plan of like watching certain animes or whatever
[7268.86s -> 7278.40s]  Um, I just kind of catch them if I you know, feel like it one day. What about one piece?
[7279.49s -> 7282.05s]  Um, I okay this is probably gonna piss a lot of people off

[7309.62s -> 7311.46s]  Yeah, whatever one goes
[7311.46s -> 7313.46s]  Give it up. Give it up. Give it up. Give it up
[7314.83s -> 7318.19s]  Here's how the story goes. It's no doubt from the treasure in the grand line
[7318.19s -> 7323.63s]  It's no doubt. We don't want to be king. I'd be king of the island. He wants to be king. Yeah

[7381.31s -> 7387.78s]  I keep forgetting you're not 20
[7390.19s -> 7392.99s]  That means you watched the four kids one in your 20s

[7399.55s -> 7403.15s]  and like I'd catch the intro and be like, oh, okay, this is a show I guess and then like

[7512.32s -> 7514.32s]  And see what the fuck was on tv
[7515.52s -> 7517.52s]  They have a footstep thing. I didn't open an app
[7517.92s -> 7522.16s]  I didn't open an application and just pick any tv show i've ever wanted to watch and watch it
[7522.16s -> 7526.08s]  No, we had to we had to scroll we had to scroll through our tv stations. Peter hates it
[7526.80s -> 7530.96s]  I mean, I guess we did kind of that makes no sense though. We don't even use our feet
[7532.48s -> 7538.38s]  That's true
[7538.38s -> 7542.22s]  Yeah, those of you guys that remember going to the tv guide channel
[7542.70s -> 7549.74s]  And watching the scroll the like one mile per hour scroll go steps go steps waiting to see what the fuck was on cartoon network

[7598.22s -> 7606.66s]  I don't know why this matters. Um, I who cares but apparently literally all it was was just for me to figure out
[7606.74s -> 7608.74s]  When reruns of the simpsons were on
[7609.22s -> 7612.90s]  Wow, literally the most interesting conversation i've had all night jama, so don't worry about it

[7674.48s -> 7678.64s]  I may have taken there. Oh shit
[7681.92s -> 7693.38s]  Oops, can I I have a ability but I can't area talk for some reason. Yeah. Yo, yeah, yo
[7694.10s -> 7696.90s]  I'm sorry
[7696.90s -> 7701.95s]  Hello hunters. Can you hear me?
[7704.29s -> 7706.37s]  Give it up luffy
[7706.45s -> 7712.30s]  Give it up solo
[7712.30s -> 7718.53s]  Give it up. Give it up. Give it up. Give it up. Here's how the story goes
[7718.53s -> 7737.62s]  It's no doubt with the treasure in the grand line. It's no doubt. I'll be king of the pirates. I'm gonna be king
[7742.93s -> 7744.77s]  I'm throwing it over there
[7744.77s -> 7750.27s]  I gotta get out of here though
[7750.27s -> 7753.31s]  Fell for it. You fell for it. You fell for it. You fell for it. You fell for it. You fell for it
[7753.63s -> 7763.79s]  I got a good spot
[7763.79s -> 7765.17s]  They learned
[7765.17s -> 7767.25s]  No, I hit them with a door. I saw that
[7769.30s -> 7774.91s]  And then they may have they may have become wise at that point. All right jerma, it's on you
[7775.23s -> 7786.99s]  I'll see what I can do. I'm going for it. Oh, never mind. We can all kill them now. Yeah, let's go for a quick kill
[7797.58s -> 7801.26s]  Jesus
[7801.26s -> 7802.46s]  No
[7802.46s -> 7807.31s]  Let's drop. Oh, no
[7807.31s -> 7808.83s]  Good game. Good game. Good game
[7808.83s -> 7816.43s]  Kraken I watched as a ghost objected you in the back of the skull
[7817.46s -> 7819.54s]  It was why did none of you attack the door?
[7820.42s -> 7822.82s]  Like I was hitting people with the door
[7824.45s -> 7826.61s]  I don't know. Sometimes they're useful
[7827.41s -> 7832.14s]  Well, I randomly like I just hit the voice chat button and I ask a stupid question don't let the door hit you
[7833.02s -> 7835.90s]  Breakfast let's do a peter griffin impression. It's like i'm like a
[7836.86s -> 7838.38s]  on the way out
[7838.38s -> 7840.38s]  Yeah, I was gonna say that as well
[7841.42s -> 7846.05s]  I'll be king of the pirates. I want to be king
[7848.56s -> 7859.92s]  I like that loadout. It's fun. Actually. No, I don't give me this regular weapon. All right, let's do it. Let's take them up
[7862.59s -> 7867.15s]  That was a good strategy. Hey, uh, hey jerma watch the floor
[7867.71s -> 7871.76s]  What's going on?
[7871.76s -> 7874.16s]  I'm spraying the floor. Oh, that's a spray show
[7875.41s -> 7877.82s]  Yeah
[7877.82s -> 7879.82s]  You use the z key
[7879.82s -> 7884.80s]  What is this? Is it spray your steam like avatar?
[7885.76s -> 7886.64s]  Yeah
[7886.64s -> 7889.84s]  That's what's aiming at the roof. It's just oh, yeah the roof
[7890.56s -> 7892.56s]  Oh, that's not bad. Okay
[7895.74s -> 7897.74s]  Alone in the dark
[7905.23s -> 7908.91s]  This is fun. I like how you had the basic strategy of just kill them fast and we did it
[7909.31s -> 7912.35s]  Yeah, just just just swarm. I think the swarm actually makes more sense
[7912.51s -> 7916.83s]  Just everybody can come out of their uh furniture and just go right click right click like let's just swarm them
[7919.54s -> 7921.94s]  Jerma, we're we're we're hunting the ghosts this round
[7922.88s -> 7924.88s]  Oh, yeah, but I mean when we are when we're ghosts
[7925.74s -> 7926.54s]  Oh, yeah, okay
[7926.54s -> 7929.74s]  But I mean we also die like crazy when people swarm as humans too
[7929.74s -> 7932.78s]  It's I think when your ghosts you're supposed to catch them
[7932.86s -> 7936.54s]  You're still supposed to catch them by surprise because if you're getting close you just fucking wreck them
[7938.26s -> 7941.14s]  Yeah, just like 50 damage a swing. That's kind of insane. Yeah
[7943.95s -> 7950.59s]  By the way, uh, if you have c4 use it in the final end like end round and it just eviscerates them it insta kills them
[7951.39s -> 7967.74s]  I wish we could throw our voices as the um humans. I think there's something up here
[7969.46s -> 7972.35s]  Oh, where are you at upstairs? It's it's like orange
[7973.23s -> 7977.09s]  Oh, okay jolly over by you gotcha. I'm coming to you
[7980.62s -> 7982.62s]  Got him in somebody back nice
[7986.14s -> 7988.42s]  I'll go get one
[7988.42s -> 7990.42s]  We only really need one person with a vacuum
[7990.82s -> 7994.50s]  And someone's got it. Yeah. Yeah, I got it. I'm like, okay cool luigi right now
[7995.30s -> 7998.10s]  All right. We got luigi upstairs seems pretty clear
[7998.82s -> 8006.98s]  For the moment for the time being we just did that he's a fan check it
[8013.31s -> 8014.03s]  Who was doing that?
[8014.03s -> 8017.71s]  It was like who was talking one of the ghost team like you shut the fuck up when you said he was a fan
[8017.87s -> 8019.87s]  I thought you were making fun of fans
[8021.95s -> 8027.57s]  Well, now he's a wheelchair like I don't want to make fun of wheelchairs and now he's dead do it do it
[8028.37s -> 8030.69s]  No longer a fan of yours. No, I don't think I will
[8031.49s -> 8033.73s]  Whoever on the ghost team is talking right now. You need to shut the fuck up
[8046.53s -> 8059.54s]  Someone someone's up. Somebody's up here. Ah, it's going crazy. You have the radar too jerma. I do. Yeah
[8060.42s -> 8065.82s]  All right. I see it too. I guess you just yeah, you're supposed to start shooting stuff. I guess I don't know
[8068.22s -> 8069.82s]  I would be the bathtub
[8069.82s -> 8072.56s]  It was me
[8081.78s -> 8085.62s]  This is like the reverse of that black mace of it there's something in somebody's in here
[8087.06s -> 8089.06s]  Oh, I think I found him. Yeah
[8089.38s -> 8090.74s]  There we go
[8093.74s -> 8096.77s]  I got the vacuum
[8096.77s -> 8103.78s]  Okay, I actually don't have the vacuum. I don't have a vacuum either apparently i'll get it. Oh, sorry. I was distracted
[8104.54s -> 8107.20s]  Should I guard this here?
[8107.20s -> 8125.30s]  Yeah, that'd probably be a good idea. All right, we're good. Awesome. You guys got any activity over there? I'm going back over here
[8131.49s -> 8133.26s]  Yeah, yeah
[8133.26s -> 8138.02s]  Okay, come on gwen really. Yeah, come on gwen. Where are you?
[8139.52s -> 8143.52s]  Okay, find anything jerma. I think there's somebody up here. It's going crazy right here
[8143.92s -> 8151.01s]  I tried the doors
[8151.90s -> 8153.58s]  Yeah the doors
[8153.58s -> 8166.61s]  Could be below. Yeah, I could be below. This is going crazy meat is going crazy. Okay
[8168.00s -> 8172.56s]  Oh, there's a whole basement. You should shoot guys a couple more times. No, where's it at?
[8174.16s -> 8175.60s]  In the basement
[8175.60s -> 8177.60s]  Ah, shoot, I should have known
[8179.39s -> 8181.39s]  Sorry, i'm not good with directions
[8186.51s -> 8187.95s]  Maybe it is the basement
[8187.95s -> 8197.30s]  Whoever's on the ghost team right now like just talking needs to shut the fuck up 49 seconds. He's talking about
[8199.10s -> 8204.93s]  Like don't think i'm annoying or anything like that
[8210.14s -> 8216.48s]  Imagine being like that pissed. It's like whoever on the ghost team
[8229.52s -> 8234.80s]  Where are you? I how can you be so clear but so far away at the same time? I don't understand
[8235.52s -> 8239.68s]  I don't understand. How could you be so clear?
[8240.00s -> 8250.26s]  Is that a real person? All right, watch out in the hallway bench
[8251.30s -> 8253.30s]  Now there's one uh in the hallway, dude
[8254.30s -> 8255.74s]  He just went down
[8255.74s -> 8266.78s]  He's a little fucking
[8266.78s -> 8268.78s]  Damn it. I didn't get out the door in time
[8269.68s -> 8271.68s]  Oh, he was a frying pan
[8276.29s -> 8277.89s]  He was so small
[8277.89s -> 8288.80s]  Hey, what was on the ghost team? Just shut the fuck up right now. Nice duck. Where'd you get a duck?
[8289.68s -> 8291.68s]  You got a duck what? That's a great duck there
[8291.76s -> 8294.19s]  Yeah, I got to duck him up. He's a fridge
[8294.19s -> 8298.78s]  I like the fridge
[8298.78s -> 8300.46s]  It didn't do me no good
[8300.46s -> 8302.06s]  Well, i'm just imagining
[8302.06s -> 8306.14s]  Being on the ghost team and hearing in the distance kind of footsteps and being like, you know
[8306.38s -> 8308.38s]  What was on the ghost team doing the fuck up?
[8309.39s -> 8311.73s]  It's just like wow
[8311.73s -> 8317.57s]  Psycho like real life if you lads would like we can do one more if not, I have no problem with calling it here
[8318.21s -> 8320.69s]  I'm down with whatever i'm having fun. I'm having a lot of this is great
[8322.32s -> 8333.90s]  Yeah, I can go another
[8339.76s -> 8344.93s]  All right, let me this is this is gonna be a good one here. I think I wanted to copy that sounds fun
[8351.73s -> 8353.73s]  Oh back at the museum level
[8354.37s -> 8357.73s]  I feel like the museum is hard for the ghost because everything's so
[8358.29s -> 8364.48s]  in such proximity
[8364.48s -> 8366.48s]  Jerm i have an idea follow me i'm behind you
[8366.96s -> 8371.33s]  Okay on it. So
[8371.33s -> 8372.77s]  These two birds
[8372.77s -> 8374.37s]  That's actually perfect
[8374.37s -> 8377.25s]  I knocked yours over. I'm sorry
[8377.25s -> 8382.30s]  Are we gonna make sure they are perfectly aligned?
[8390.86s -> 8392.94s]  Beak somebody said beak to beep
[8393.66s -> 8395.90s]  Wait, I shouldn't have said that
[8395.90s -> 8403.15s]  Oh, they can't hear us right now. Now if we're too close, it's too it's obvious
[8403.79s -> 8409.12s]  So if i'm in here and I do the um
[8409.76s -> 8412.61s]  genuinely
[8412.61s -> 8417.65s]  That like possess you do the pretend to be another person on their team. Do I have to be out of the
[8418.67s -> 8446.37s]  Object to do it. I think you'll automatically leave the object when you hit it. Oh god. Here they come if we could do something wacky
[8450.58s -> 8453.62s]  We could hold right click and aim at the same person and try to instantly kill them
[8456.82s -> 8460.64s]  Okay, right here. Someone's gonna come investigate in a second
[8485.82s -> 8492.10s]  For fuck's sake
[8492.10s -> 8494.10s]  Didn't work. I'm sorry. It didn't work
[8495.31s -> 8499.71s]  That's okay. It was a solid plan. They moved right at the last second and we couldn't get it
[8500.27s -> 8503.65s]  We're still alive though. So that's good
[8503.65s -> 8504.69s]  Yeah
[8504.69s -> 8525.09s]  Just like walking around
[8541.66s -> 8543.66s]  Oh shit we're blocking each other
[8552.98s -> 8555.18s]  Do it
[8555.18s -> 8557.18s]  Do it do it
[8571.46s -> 8573.46s]  Oh, no, please
[8573.70s -> 8627.78s]  Oh my god, I forgot that you guys hear that. Holy shit. I'm so sorry. I forgot that you're hearing that on the stream
[8628.40s -> 8631.52s]  I'm like just fucking with him like oh, he's definitely not the pig. I don't ever know
[8632.30s -> 8636.38s]  I i'm trying to do pig noises over there. So they think like oh he's pretending to be the pig
[8636.54s -> 8642.46s]  You know what I mean? Yeah, but you guys will hear it. I don't want to fuck with you guys
[8643.02s -> 8678.91s]  You good? Oh
[8680.50s -> 8682.18s]  Looks like bugleberry
[8682.18s -> 8687.04s]  But we still have up just one two
[8687.71s -> 8697.06s]  Two. Yeah, they got all four. All right, it's gonna be tough. I stayed in one spot the entire game. Did you really?
[8698.34s -> 8700.82s]  It was a cup of a brontosaurus dead
[8706.43s -> 8714.27s]  By the way, the shunt ability after you're dead is really powerful and i'm playing fucking soccer with the sun right now
[8715.23s -> 8717.39s]  Oh us pigs love to roll around in mud
[8719.78s -> 8721.78s]  Us pigs love rolling around in mud
[8734.11s -> 8742.37s]  Back here ow squeeze his hog
[8750.94s -> 8753.42s]  Oh, all right, we got it. We got it. We got it. Get him
[8760.59s -> 8762.59s]  I'm not gonna squeeze
[8763.31s -> 8764.91s]  It's very cramped in here
[8764.91s -> 8770.03s]  There's one thing that people hate. It's why I can't believe we lost like pig squealing noises. Nobody likes it
[8770.03s -> 8772.59s]  They hate it people. It's like dude. Don't like I hate that sound
[8773.15s -> 8777.57s]  That's a good game
[8777.57s -> 8780.29s]  Alone and alone in the dark illumination therma
[8781.94s -> 8785.94s]  Um, i've had the same profile picture for like at least five years or so
[8787.22s -> 8792.50s]  Okay, fair enough mine's probably since 2007 so I get you I kind of have this burned in my brain
[8793.22s -> 8796.26s]  Of hiding in team fortress. Oh, they can't hear me anymore
[8797.90s -> 8802.46s]  Uh, you'd change your profile picture and my name would be like fucking like inspector gadget
[8802.86s -> 8814.66s]  So people wouldn't know it was me. I gotta I could explain that i'm gonna ask you gemma why gas can
[8815.62s -> 8817.62s]  Okay, I I can give a really good explanation
[8818.02s -> 8823.12s]  so back in the day I used to make team fortress 2 videos, right and
[8823.92s -> 8826.40s]  I would if I was if I was germa
[8826.88s -> 8831.52s]  Like germa 985 in a team fortress 2 game with like a germa profile picture or something
[8832.16s -> 8838.16s]  People would see it and people would stand at the spawn and like high five and the whole game sometimes would get all messed up
[8838.80s -> 8840.56s]  So what I started doing
[8840.56s -> 8847.28s]  Is just starting making my name something completely different every single day and changing my avatar to something different every single day
[8847.92s -> 8849.92s]  So I could just nobody would even know it was me
[8851.52s -> 8857.12s]  Gemma i'm gonna be real. I was in the menu like the ready menu for 90% of that conversation
[8857.12s -> 8859.60s]  So I joined in until like the last two seconds of it
[8862.02s -> 8863.62s]  All right tldr
[8863.62s -> 8864.90s]  tldr
[8864.90s -> 8870.10s]  Uh back in team fortress 2 I used to hide so people wouldn't know it was me playing so like I could be I could get
[8870.10s -> 8875.54s]  Like a real gameplay that wasn't like five pocket medics and like five people outside the spawn trying to high five me
[8877.07s -> 8878.91s]  You got right pirate spy
[8878.91s -> 8884.21s]  Yeah, I I used to watch you gemma. I still watch you
[8884.69s -> 8886.21s]  Oh cool
[8886.21s -> 8887.33s]  That's cool
[8887.33s -> 8889.65s]  I'm watching you trying to act like a normal person
[8890.43s -> 8893.76s]  Fucking hilarious. Hey, I
[8894.70s -> 8899.82s]  I wake up in the morning like everybody else. I brush my teeth once a week
[8900.54s -> 8901.58s]  I
[8901.58s -> 8903.66s]  Wear pants sometimes maybe once a week
[8904.38s -> 8908.94s]  I'm a normal person just like okay. At what point do you clean up the blood of your last night's victim?
[8911.89s -> 8913.25s]  Yes
[8913.25s -> 8916.21s]  All right. Now I know I let you know. I know you watch now
[8916.21s -> 8918.21s]  I know you watch the channel speaks volumes
[8920.69s -> 8930.46s]  Now i'm good. Now. I know you watch uh, we got a jolly imposter over here, by the way
[8932.67s -> 8935.23s]  Hey, come here. Come here. What do you what do you want to go the word?
[8936.06s -> 8938.06s]  Do you do you want to go upstairs? What do you think they should be?
[8938.96s -> 8942.24s]  Wait, that's the real person. What? Hey, what's the emote button?
[8943.20s -> 8948.00s]  Post to fake people. Wait, how is that the real there was two jollies on the screen? Did I follow the wrong one?
[8949.09s -> 8951.01s]  It's v
[8951.01s -> 8955.94s]  Peace offering
[8955.94s -> 8960.34s]  Wait, why are there two me? Okay, somebody's fucking pretending to be me. I followed the wrong one
[8960.34s -> 8962.02s]  I thought you were the fake one
[8962.02s -> 8964.02s]  Geez, that's not me
[8968.66s -> 8973.30s]  Over here
[8973.30s -> 8987.50s]  My dick, bro
[8987.50s -> 8993.01s]  That's weird
[8993.01s -> 8997.46s]  No activity over here
[8997.46s -> 8998.50s]  creepy
[8998.50s -> 9017.09s]  I'm not getting i'm not getting any activity at all. Here we go. Somebody over here. No, they're moving. They're on the move
[9023.98s -> 9029.74s]  um
[9029.74s -> 9031.74s]  That's is this somebody here
[9035.22s -> 9036.66s]  He was the duck
[9036.66s -> 9038.66s]  Of course, he's the fucking duck
[9040.61s -> 9044.85s]  That spy is not one of us that heavy is a spy that sniper is a heavy that heavy
[9044.85s -> 9049.81s]  He's not one of us that one of us is you I made that joke like 10 years ago. God was it good
[9059.58s -> 9061.58s]  Listen, you didn't know I was the duck
[9061.98s -> 9063.98s]  You you had no idea
[9066.78s -> 9070.86s]  At this point you do the duck so often that like you aren't the duck now, you know what I mean?
[9073.52s -> 9077.44s]  I see the strats
[9077.44s -> 9080.48s]  Yeah
[9080.48s -> 9081.76s]  Uh
[9081.76s -> 9088.67s]  Did you find anything?
[9088.67s -> 9092.59s]  I am not getting anything
[9092.59s -> 9094.11s]  Just keep shooting
[9094.11s -> 9099.50s]  There's a little bit up in the run away a little bit in this room, but it keeps going up and down
[9101.22s -> 9105.78s]  It'll go down if they're taunting or jumping or moving in any way really?
[9105.78s -> 9108.34s]  Okay, so they so they can just move backwards and forwards
[9108.34s -> 9115.23s]  There's a ectoplasm meter on your right hand side when you're a ghost. I mean that fills up you become more
[9116.03s -> 9117.87s]  aware
[9117.87s -> 9121.95s]  Yeah, they can see you easier. So as long as you keep that low, he's totally one of these ducks
[9122.67s -> 9130.59s]  Are they all ducks? I could see that as a strap. I wanted to be all spacemen. The spacemen are fucking creepy
[9132.19s -> 9134.19s]  It's actually probably a really stupid spots
[9134.51s -> 9137.87s]  Just to be all be the same item and just be in the same room and spread out
[9137.95s -> 9140.94s]  Be like why would they ever do that?
[9140.94s -> 9146.06s]  Also, there's a little orc with the headphones on that nobody's ever been and I feel like that's a missed opportunity
[9147.02s -> 9149.10s]  In here in here trash can in here on me
[9151.70s -> 9153.46s]  trash can
[9153.46s -> 9154.50s]  plant

[9191.01s -> 9199.42s]  What the fuck rambert kite them don't stand still
[9200.14s -> 9202.14s]  I couldn't even fuck I got stuck on the stairs
[9202.78s -> 9206.38s]  I had my body was immediately died. Well, yeah. Okay. Good. Cool
[9207.10s -> 9211.90s]  I swear to god. I got stuck on the staircase. I couldn't move. I couldn't walk forward. No pressure. No pressure like I was
[9212.94s -> 9214.94s]  Pretend you're playing doom eternal
[9215.10s -> 9217.42s]  I said it just you call of duty zombies it
[9218.14s -> 9221.23s]  Yeah
[9221.23s -> 9223.23s]  Yeah, what was that like?
[9227.15s -> 9236.34s]  Chili
[9236.34s -> 9244.53s]  Somebody said don't come back to boston
[9246.05s -> 9248.37s]  I'm not allowed back in my in my hometown

[9257.58s -> 9262.86s]  Like i'm gonna make a big announcement like boston i'm coming back i'm here what like i'm but i'm not annoying
[9263.50s -> 9265.50s]  Oh god, everyone's after you
[9266.77s -> 9269.25s]  You've changed I am the last one left
[9270.13s -> 9272.13s]  Would make sense. Yes
[9272.53s -> 9277.17s]  You're near the supply center if you can get there and kill yourself. No, that's that's bullshit
[9278.42s -> 9280.26s]  that's not a chance, but
[9280.26s -> 9282.26s]  Oh, they're they're on you. Oh god
[9285.58s -> 9288.38s]  That is so scary. Oh good try
[9289.50s -> 9292.18s]  That was scary
[9292.18s -> 9296.69s]  Nice. Nice. Nice. That was spooky. I love the bear
[9298.59s -> 9301.92s]  bear and astronaut there
[9302.32s -> 9306.53s]  All right, i'm gonna head back into discord and unmute and just thank everybody
[9307.33s -> 9309.01s]  Cool sounds good
[9309.01s -> 9310.53s]  Sounds good. Okay
[9310.53s -> 9318.26s]  I've unmuted
[9318.26s -> 9323.22s]  You know what that was pretty good for a bootleg prop hunt on tmachel. Yeah, it was fun. No, that was a lot of fun
[9324.80s -> 9326.66s]  Yeah
[9326.66s -> 9331.78s]  Uh, I think it could use a little bit of work in some spots and the balancing is weird
[9331.86s -> 9335.78s]  but and also the positional voice chat's like a little too low, but
[9336.98s -> 9338.98s]  Yeah, it was great. I enjoyed it
[9339.55s -> 9343.25s]  Yeah, I think that some of the weapons maybe need some uh tuning
[9344.46s -> 9348.06s]  But I think it was overall it was overall a solid experience. That's a lot of fun
[9349.20s -> 9352.08s]  Jerma, I I use a assault shotgun in real life
[9352.64s -> 9354.64s]  To defend against mosquitoes
[9355.28s -> 9358.16s]  And and they're expecting me to use that against ghosts
[9359.54s -> 9360.98s]  I mean it worked
[9360.98s -> 9364.10s]  I had well, I added the extended mag for my shotgun
[9364.18s -> 9367.54s]  So it had two barrels with three shots and that was just amusing the whole time
[9368.02s -> 9372.50s]  It also killed ghost pretty well too if you remember it's certainly my favorite gun. No, that was that was fun
[9373.90s -> 9380.37s]  Cool. Well, I appreciate everybody joining. Um, hey, let's do let's do this again. Let's do this again sometime. Absolutely

[9766.46s -> 9779.44s]  There's no batteries, but this is what that's what she'd have would have sounded like I pressed the buttons to play
[9779.44s -> 9783.66s]  It was just very soft because the Shido is out of batteries, but you can still very soft
[9783.66s -> 9804.42s]  You just couldn't hear it daily Shito. Okay, so who's still live from that group?
