[2.42s -> 13.02s]  Hey, what's up? Hey, what's up? How you doing? Hey Jerma, good to see you. I'm a whole day,
[13.02s -> 20.01s]  a whole day early. I tend to be doing, I don't know what's going on with the schedule, man.
[20.01s -> 29.22s]  I really don't understand. I mean, I don't have a schedule. The sus has been so wrong. It's,
[29.22s -> 38.54s]  I show up a day early or a day late. If the sus says like four o'clock on a Tuesday,
[39.34s -> 46.06s]  I might just be, that means Monday at eight o'clock Pacific or Thursday at two o'clock
[46.06s -> 54.07s]  Pacific. The sus has been just so all over the place. But yeah, we're gonna, we're streaming
[54.07s -> 63.10s]  right now. Just briefly go over what's going on before I hop on a call. First of all, hi.
[64.41s -> 72.33s]  Second of all, gonna be playing Risk tonight. That's right. The board game Risk online
[73.13s -> 79.74s]  with other streamers. I believe so far, I believe we have, it's me Ludwig, Connery's pants
[80.38s -> 87.00s]  and critical so far. That might be it. That sounds like pretty pog group by the way.
[91.50s -> 101.22s]  And then we're going to play DOS. Oh, that's the plan. Let me jump in this call. So I'm,
[101.22s -> 108.04s]  I don't really play Risk that often, but I'm pretty good. Risk with a resident sleeper face.
[109.46s -> 113.54s]  No, no, you can't resident sleeper Risk until six hours has gone by
[113.54s -> 120.49s]  and everyone wants to go home. Gentlemen, how are we? If they said to me and I don't eat,
[121.05s -> 127.70s]  I cannot hear anything. What happened? Why can I not hear anything?
[129.08s -> 147.93s]  My audio is fucked up, man. Hold on. Oh, my headphones are unplugged. I'm going to go,
[147.93s -> 167.51s]  I'm going to hire a pro audio technician. What is going on with this audio? Oh shit. I think I
[167.51s -> 183.59s]  have like a DOS game open. I think a DOS games open. That's what's going on. Hold on. Okay,
[183.59s -> 191.62s]  we're good. All right, we're good. If he has smoothies and stuff for nutrients, then maybe.
[192.98s -> 196.02s]  But like no calories at all. You just don't, you don't make that.
[199.88s -> 203.88s]  I don't, I don't know how much he weighs. Like there's a couple of people that have done
[203.88s -> 207.72s]  no eating for like a year, but they were extremely obese and were fine,
[207.80s -> 215.00s]  but they supplemented nutrients. But Mr. Beast isn't like super out of shape or anything like
[215.00s -> 219.32s]  that. So I just don't see him being able to pull that off. We got a good crew. This is a really
[219.32s -> 223.56s]  good crew. I'm excited. Yeah. German, what's the longest you could go without eating four Big Macs
[223.56s -> 228.92s]  in a row? A lot without eating four Big Macs in a row. We'll just do normal McDonald's order,
[228.92s -> 236.92s]  I guess. I mean, I get McDonald's maybe once every 10 days. I'd say probably, I'd say 11 days.
[241.91s -> 247.35s]  Uh, gamers, does everyone have risk? Is it risk global domination? The free one? Yeah,
[247.35s -> 254.07s]  that's the one. Okay. I'm downloading though. Um, I love it. I don't know why you're so quiet.
[254.79s -> 261.82s]  Oh, am I? I sometimes this problem. Oh, let me, is this better? Oh, there you go. Turn myself up a
[261.82s -> 270.25s]  bit. I can hear him. I don't have a cloud lifter. That's why I thought that, uh, the music playing
[270.25s -> 276.38s]  right now was, I'm doing DOS games after this. I thought that I had DOS games open in the
[276.38s -> 280.30s]  background because the song is playing and I realistically thought it was like a midi DOS game
[280.30s -> 288.86s]  music. It is, what is it? What else is it? It's in something else, but it is, it is a terrible,
[288.86s -> 298.65s]  but also amazing song. Is that like, what was the last time anybody here played risk?
[299.29s -> 304.09s]  I've never played risk. You've never played it? Really? I've never played it. I had
[304.33s -> 309.29s]  old risk game on the PlayStation one when I was like eight, but all I did was mash a couple
[309.29s -> 316.73s]  buttons every now and then and gave up. I guess it's pretty, it's pretty self-explanatory, right?
[316.73s -> 321.46s]  You just roll dice at each other. Yeah. I didn't even know they were nice in the game. So this is
[321.46s -> 328.28s]  going to be real wild for me. I think they're like, uh, power-ups. Is this classic risk or is
[328.28s -> 347.22s]  there like, can you do wacky shit? Don't know. Well, I got don't know. Well, I got don't know.
[347.22s -> 355.74s]  Well, that's all right. He's busy. He's busy. He's setting up stuff. I know nothing about this game.
[355.74s -> 365.78s]  All right. Let me explain very briefly. It's a map of the world. We get to place troops. For instance,
[365.78s -> 369.46s]  I'm not going to say this on, uh, on camera in front of them, but I'll say it on camera in front
[369.46s -> 376.84s]  of you. Australia. If you hold Australia, you get to at least watch your friends destroy each other
[376.84s -> 381.40s]  and hang out for like an hour and just sip like a Coke. That's what I used to do. I would just take,
[381.40s -> 386.04s]  I would have Australia and that, uh, that like southeastern region, which could, you could only
[386.04s -> 391.14s]  attack from one place and I would just drink like two Cokes and be able to at least participate for
[391.14s -> 396.06s]  a while. So that's kind of what I'm going to try to do. Uh, but yeah, it's, it's, it's country that
[396.06s -> 402.12s]  you claim. I'm in game. I'm ready to ride. I think there's like a, probably a code we're going to use.
[402.12s -> 411.21s]  Right. I imagine. True. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I went to get headphones. How the fuck are you guys?
[411.21s -> 415.94s]  It's good to see you guys. I'm doing great. They're doing great, man. Hope you're, you're doing well.
[415.94s -> 424.09s]  Yeah. It's been great. This game is loud. What is your strategy? What are you, what are you guys
[424.09s -> 431.16s]  thinking of strategy? Cause I have one. I've never, well, that's no, I played this game one time, uh,
[431.16s -> 438.04s]  on the eighth grade field trip on the way, on the bus on the way to DC. Um, that was it.
[438.04s -> 443.08s]  So none of the three of you, it turns out, I haven't played this game much at all. I actually
[443.08s -> 447.34s]  have some experience. I just played this all the time. Really? I did. I mean, I can't say I'm very
[447.34s -> 452.70s]  good, but I understand the basic kind of what's going on. I've played a good amount of this game,
[452.70s -> 459.42s]  but the reason I asked you three in specific is because usually the way it goes is alliances form
[459.42s -> 464.94s]  and bitter rival restart. But I picked the three people who could, I think I could never get mad
[464.94s -> 472.42s]  at ever in hopes that, uh, it will lead me to a combination. I was really sweet of you, sir.
[472.42s -> 477.86s]  Also the three least experienced players I know, which just was coincidental. Yeah, no, that's fair.
[477.86s -> 487.32s]  Let's see how you feel at the end of this three dice. They just gave me it. I take this incredibly
[487.32s -> 492.60s]  seriously and I got, I'm sorry. If you guys, I say like talk a bunch of shit and call you names and
[492.60s -> 500.84s]  stuff. I don't mean it. Oh, it's fine. That's what makes it fun. Do you think you come in and make
[500.84s -> 508.60s]  it like a funny name? I'm excited. I haven't played this in a long time. All right. So for rules,
[508.60s -> 513.72s]  I'm going to turn off manual placement. It'll automatically place all of the, uh, the things
[513.72s -> 519.58s]  for us. The basic way risk works is we will evenly divide at the start of the territory.
[519.58s -> 524.36s]  That means I can't pick them where you land and then you have to like move your forces around.
[524.36s -> 531.82s]  It'll make sense when we're in it. Random is hard because random just put you, you could be anywhere.
[531.82s -> 538.78s]  I think the worst part about risk though is placing ships and soldiers for like an hour.
[538.78s -> 546.55s]  Yeah, it does. It can take a while. Yeah. Uh, we know how to join yet. Uh, yeah. I'm getting a code
[546.55s -> 552.10s]  for you guys right now. Are we going to have to get this off the screen for a sec? I think I can
[552.10s -> 558.66s]  just invite you guys. Good old Ludwig is online. Yeah. Are you able to, are you offline Connor?
[561.14s -> 572.55s]  All right. I invited Connor invites. Do I even have you on steam? I have to pray because we did
[572.55s -> 578.07s]  that whole thing where he played like 18 games. He used five tokens to join. Oh wait, here it is.
[578.07s -> 583.59s]  Here it is. I used five of them. I bought the game. Should I not have bought this game? It was free.
[583.91s -> 586.87s]  Yeah. But like I didn't, they said there was a timer for the amount of times you could play
[586.87s -> 590.95s]  or something. I don't know. Oh yeah. I think it's like a freemium model. I sent the code by the way
[590.95s -> 596.15s]  in the chat so you guys could join up that. I think I joined. Yeah. You're in Connor. You're in.
[597.67s -> 602.39s]  I can't show my screen just yet. So no one sees the color. They, they tripped me up on that one.
[602.39s -> 606.39s]  It said, do you want a tutorial? I said, no. Then it said, do you accept our terms? I said, no,
[606.39s -> 612.70s]  no, I'm kind of fucked. That was it. That was a big move from them. I'm not going to lie.
[612.70s -> 615.74s]  You don't accept the privacy terms. So like, you just can't play.
[617.06s -> 621.34s]  No one knows I'm lying when I say accept. I believe we're all in.
[622.22s -> 634.49s]  Are we good to go? Yeah. Preparing for battle. Let's do it. Okay. Are you as pan-germa? That's me.
[634.49s -> 642.47s]  Is that like a family? Uh, no, I, I, dude, when I split, okay, when I split team fortress too,
[642.47s -> 646.23s]  I used to have to hide my name because if people saw that it was me playing, they would just like
[646.23s -> 648.95s]  five pocket medics would be on me and that eight snipers would join the other team.
[650.34s -> 656.10s]  This is a messy map. Well, now they're going to know your gas can. Where am I?
[656.10s -> 659.30s]  Colors are on the right. So it's probably best for a camera to be on the left.
[659.30s -> 666.58s]  Okay. Okay. Middle ish is both good. I'm red. Let's make it smaller. Do I need to do something?
[666.58s -> 670.02s]  Yeah. So the timers at the top of the screen, Connor, that's your turn timer. You can see it
[670.02s -> 674.18s]  moving right now at the start of a turn, you have some troops you can place. So you have to click
[674.18s -> 680.82s]  on a blue territory and add troops to that territory. So you, yeah, you, you just bulked
[680.82s -> 688.02s]  up Eastern U S in Shenzhen. Now you can attack, which pretty straightforward. Well, usually you
[688.02s -> 692.98s]  want to attack anything with a lower number than your number adjacent to it. Oh, that makes sense.
[692.98s -> 700.09s]  So like, maybe you could attack Mexico. I can't attack Mexico. Let me do that. You could invade
[700.09s -> 704.31s]  the rest of Russia with your Russian. I can only, Oh, I see. I see how to do it. But yeah,
[704.31s -> 710.50s]  I'll take Mexico. You have to have at least, you have to have at least three, you have to leave
[710.50s -> 717.08s]  at least one person on a country. Right. That's how it works. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I should
[717.08s -> 721.24s]  have done that. Yeah. So it's a dice roll, right? And so you just sometimes lose the dice roll.
[721.24s -> 726.22s]  And that's how it determines if you win or lose the battle. Oh, I really want Venezuela though.
[726.22s -> 731.82s]  You could attack it again. And then I, no, you could use Peru. Be careful here.
[734.86s -> 739.51s]  There it is getting too thin though. Somebody can just go on great turn. That was a great turn.
[739.51s -> 743.91s]  And now the final move you get to do is you get to move pieces to a final area.
[743.91s -> 747.67s]  So if you want it to like stack one area to be really strong, you could like,
[747.67s -> 753.46s]  I got the Venezuela card. You, you do get cards when you conquer a territory and then you can
[753.46s -> 758.58s]  use those cards and cash them in for big troop bonuses. Ooh, this is going to be hard because
[758.58s -> 766.25s]  I, uh, this is Ludwig. Oh, we'll take over my home of Australia. I'm so mad that you
[766.25s -> 772.38s]  decided to do that. That's exactly what I was going to do. What? Yeah. You're not green. Are
[772.38s -> 778.06s]  you? I am green. And now I can't, I can't even, I might as well just leave. I didn't know. I didn't
[778.06s -> 785.21s]  know. Only I knew. Uh, let me, oh, this is tough now actually. What do I do? We're going to Africa.
[785.21s -> 793.11s]  Do this. I can definitely claim this completely. Do we want to attack the Philippine islands?
[793.11s -> 796.95s]  Wait, so why did you want to play with us? I feel like you don't, you said you can't ever be mad at
[796.95s -> 801.35s]  us, right? You're just going to feel bad whenever you attack us now? No, I feel great about that.
[801.35s -> 807.03s]  I feel bad losing. Oh yeah. That's the worst feeling. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I got an
[807.03s -> 814.14s]  Argentina card. So if you hold a continent, you get extra placement in the fortify round, right?
[814.14s -> 818.94s]  Yeah. I believe they'll tell you if you get the whole continent, but like if you get all of South
[818.94s -> 825.02s]  America, uh, or all of Africa, all of us, any of those, you get it like a bonus. Okay. What,
[825.02s -> 831.03s]  what is the green, the right of the bottom of South America? What is that? That country? I have zero
[831.03s -> 837.46s]  clue. They just made one up. Yeah. What is that? What is that? It's a Mauritius islands. It's
[837.46s -> 843.40s]  Atlanta, the Falkland islands is what it's called. Hmm. Falkland. Oh, you can choose how much dice
[843.40s -> 848.04s]  you want to roll. Right. Okay. That's Atlantis. Yeah. You could, you could lower the amount.
[849.08s -> 858.57s]  Hang tight, Egypt. Oh, we got no leader. If I've ever heard one. No, now nobody, nobody go anywhere.
[859.29s -> 865.32s]  Cause this is, this is, this is a border here. If you enter Europe, there will be repercussions.
[865.32s -> 872.09s]  I'm trying to just, I'm trying to stay here in this, uh, in Africa. I'm trying to, I,
[872.09s -> 876.63s]  I'm going to tell you right now. I'm going to, we're here. I'm coming for you. No, you don't want,
[876.63s -> 882.82s]  you don't want to fuck with Congo. I'll tell you right now. We're strong. Oh, shit though. I have,
[882.82s -> 894.58s]  who's blue? That's Connor. That's me. I can only roll two. Oh yeah. Connor. Yes. All right. You
[894.58s -> 898.73s]  want to give me, uh, you want to give me Africa and I'll leave you alone in South America? Yeah.
[898.73s -> 905.24s]  Yeah. You can have it. Okay. Alliance. Okay. So do I like, do I need to do something like just,
[905.24s -> 915.74s]  just leave next room? Oh, okay. All right. I'm going to be aggressive. Wait, what? How do I?
[915.74s -> 922.57s]  Thank you. Wait, what are you confused on? You have to click the country you want. Somebody said,
[922.57s -> 933.75s]  I'm glad Jerma finally made some friends. Fucking plenty of friends. We're in the top,
[933.75s -> 940.20s]  Charlie. Your third through. Okay. I love you. I'm like a seven year old. That's like going to
[940.20s -> 945.10s]  school for the first time. Maxing out that to seven and then taking like,
[945.10s -> 948.46s]  you know, Northern Russia is a good idea, but you got to go fast. You're losing time here.
[948.46s -> 955.18s]  All right. I'm, I'm taking America. Oh, I didn't want to do. Oh, whoa. I feel threatened up there.
[955.18s -> 961.08s]  All right. You got to go next to the bottom. All right. And then you attack. Okay. I'm coming.
[961.64s -> 972.70s]  Lovely lady Liberty. The Canadians need to calm down. I own that weird. Whatever that is one
[972.70s -> 979.11s]  country. What is this country is you got to hit attack Charlie. I got one quickest one,
[979.11s -> 988.57s]  although it's less measured. I think I'm getting it. It's Greenland to be too. Let's go. Hey,
[990.31s -> 996.60s]  this is not Greenland. So wait, if you have one, can you like net, you can never fight like two,
[996.60s -> 1002.36s]  right? Yes. One can never fight because they have to stay home. So then you roll for like,
[1002.36s -> 1008.87s]  what's the brand them aspect? Like when like I picked somebody to like fight your two troops,
[1008.87s -> 1015.29s]  we both get two dice. And if your die rolls are higher, you win. But if mine are higher or to
[1015.29s -> 1019.05s]  draw, I win. So I think there's an attacker's advantage. Maybe it's a defender's advantage.
[1019.05s -> 1025.03s]  You have, and you have to move at least three troops. If you attack with three dice.
[1025.03s -> 1029.59s]  Yeah, I'm going to give Ukraine four troops because I stand with Ukraine.
[1029.59s -> 1036.55s]  So the strategy is if you roll with one die against somebody with one, you won't,
[1036.55s -> 1041.66s]  you won't have to take all your troops. It's defenders advantage. I lied. Sorry. Excuse me.
[1041.66s -> 1048.50s]  So wait, the German, what did you want me to do? I'm okay. I'm willing to let you have whatever
[1048.50s -> 1054.97s]  that green spot over there is. Oh, the Falklands. Yeah. You take that. But I want to get out of here.
[1054.97s -> 1060.76s]  Attack it. All right. Well, what you could do is you could attack. Who's red? Is that a Madagascar?
[1060.76s -> 1065.13s]  You could, you could help me out there and get knocked that down a little. I think you should go
[1065.13s -> 1068.81s]  for bottom left Connor. Cause then you get all of South Africa or America and you get a bonus.
[1068.81s -> 1072.18s]  So you should attack the Falkland islands, but you have to go quick. Your turn's almost over.
[1073.46s -> 1079.54s]  Okay. And then move all your troops. So then German will, will come in. You see how it's
[1079.54s -> 1085.56s]  like blue outlined, like it's a YouTube thumbnail. Yeah. Buggers came out of my
[1085.56s -> 1096.34s]  nose and you said that. I don't know why. Oh, okay. All right. All right. So my whole turn is done.
[1096.34s -> 1108.62s]  Oh, I should not have done this. Let's just keep it simple. Let's just send three.
[1108.62s -> 1116.17s]  The Kiwis are too strong. Told you. Wow. Yep. I'm sending two. Not enough. You need a whole army.
[1119.70s -> 1124.58s]  And I will not attack you in South America, Connor. Cause I appreciate our alliance that
[1124.58s -> 1129.11s]  we have forming here. There's no one, no way New Zealand could just go all the way over there.
[1129.11s -> 1132.23s]  All right. I don't appreciate the, uh, the diplomacy with this other, uh, this other
[1132.23s -> 1138.68s]  general here. I mean, you can't, you can't get me to try it. You couldn't even get over here.
[1138.68s -> 1142.68s]  Okay, Connor. Now your, your boats would sink. Okay. Since you threatened us,
[1142.68s -> 1147.48s]  we've just said your boats would say, well, to prove that our boats wouldn't sink. I came
[1147.48s -> 1153.86s]  and attacked. That's not cool. I'm just trying to show you that if you give me a little lip,
[1153.86s -> 1157.86s]  then I will attack. I dare you Auckland. See what happens. They're crazy down there.
[1158.84s -> 1164.49s]  You didn't even heard of them. I refuse to be goaded. It's perfect. Uh, all right. Let's
[1164.49s -> 1172.04s]  fortify. Let's fortify up. Uh, and let's, let's actually, let's bring them back home. Huh?
[1172.04s -> 1178.44s]  Oh, wow. So if you see in the, in the middle of the left, by the way, you get these cards.
[1178.44s -> 1183.18s]  And if they're all three, the same or all three different, you get a different bonus. It says it
[1183.18s -> 1189.66s]  on the right. You can cash them in. All right. I'm going, I, I gotta, I gotta get, uh, I gotta get,
[1189.66s -> 1195.58s]  this is Madagascar. I'm going for it. No, I need, I've gotta take, I've gotta have Africa.
[1195.58s -> 1201.34s]  I need those points. Charlie, you win this. Don't even be worried. Oh, yeah, I do. Let's go baby.
[1201.34s -> 1209.88s]  No, I'm, I hold on. I don't want to count. Not enough. All right. Come on. One,
[1209.88s -> 1219.40s]  one, one, one, one, one, one, one. Let's go. I thought you did two for a second. All right. Okay.
[1220.04s -> 1234.02s]  So now I got to be careful because you love it. You're orange, right? I am. Hmm. He's not a nice
[1234.02s -> 1241.06s]  guy. I am a nice guy. I replied to diplomacy very well. The people of Argentina disagree.
[1242.18s -> 1255.10s]  People of Argentina can suck it. Whoa. I didn't know I had such a presence up there in, um,
[1255.10s -> 1269.37s]  in North America. I've been also ignoring all my troops up North. I feel good. Oh man. Oh,
[1269.53s -> 1273.53s]  how does that? I'm coming in again. I don't really know what I'm doing, but this feels good.
[1274.33s -> 1277.61s]  You're not doing bad. It's a one B two here though. It's kind of a risky fight. Oh, I didn't mean to
[1277.61s -> 1281.13s]  do that. Why is it? How do I back out when that? All right. I'm just going to keep swinging on
[1281.13s -> 1287.38s]  everything. I've gone mad. I like how you thought about asking and then just sit and screw it. I'll
[1287.38s -> 1293.35s]  just fight everything. Eastern us. I'm doing it live. Charlie. I will, I will stay here with,
[1293.35s -> 1299.59s]  uh, with Iceland and it'd be a barrier for you. Yeah. I wouldn't attack here, Charlie,
[1299.59s -> 1302.95s]  because you're going to lose a lot of troops. You might want to fortify them and bring them
[1302.95s -> 1308.42s]  South and try to attack the Mexican border. That sounds like something an enemy would say.
[1308.42s -> 1316.26s]  Oh, I had it or Charlie. I had, yeah, I had to end. I see. I didn't have a choice. I'm willing
[1316.26s -> 1322.49s]  to be kind of a shield here for you to make it so nobody can come in. I, how do I fortify? I don't
[1322.49s -> 1327.75s]  click on the place you want to bring troops to and then geography. All right. So do I use my
[1327.75s -> 1333.59s]  cards right now? You can decide your cards. I think you have to have three and they have to be
[1333.59s -> 1339.82s]  matching. And I would tell you right now, don't tell everybody if you have a match because we
[1339.82s -> 1344.70s]  people will know that you're about to drop cards to get troops. I see. Yeah. I don't have any
[1344.70s -> 1353.13s]  matches. I believe it's one of the same three or one of each, right? I have like zero matches.
[1353.13s -> 1362.60s]  Oh, you, oh, there we go. I'll do that. Oh, going for the whole us here. Huh? Oh, I lost.
[1362.60s -> 1371.62s]  Well, that sucks. East coast. Just fight strong. We're fine. Everything's fine. Charlie. It's
[1371.62s -> 1375.94s]  looking rough. I think you might have to focus on, uh, on Europe, but no Ludwig. How did you get
[1375.94s -> 1383.13s]  this many troops already? They were fine. Europe hasn't been attacked once and I'm very sad in
[1383.13s -> 1390.09s]  Australia. I said your borders are weak in the chat and that guy, please get him in my chat too.
[1390.09s -> 1395.64s]  I don't want to hear that. Get him out of everywhere. Bottom here. He doesn't have a
[1395.64s -> 1403.70s]  YouTube totally fortify over. Oh, can I fortify the ones? Uh, cause you can't leave. Cause if
[1403.70s -> 1408.34s]  they left, then you, the territory would be open. Oh, I'm like moving people adjacent. Okay. Now
[1408.34s -> 1412.66s]  I get it. Yeah. Fortifying is basically moving troops from one section adjacent to another
[1412.66s -> 1420.46s]  section. Oh shit. We move many numbers to small numbers. Cool. I did it. Is there a report feature
[1420.46s -> 1427.40s]  in this game? What would you be reporting? Who's reporting? I mean, if you click on people's avatars,
[1427.40s -> 1432.84s]  you can like make an Alliance, uh, like report this user. Is that what that is? Oh yeah. Yeah.
[1432.84s -> 1439.80s]  Presumably if they're acting, uh, awry, I guess we'll watch out a little bit. Give me some
[1439.80s -> 1445.67s]  reports later. Come from Argentina again. You do, you're doing the exact same thing I want to do.
[1445.67s -> 1449.67s]  This is like the guarantee that you can hang out with your friends for an hour and like
[1449.67s -> 1454.14s]  watch them just destroy each other. Well, you just drink like a Coke and then eventually when
[1454.14s -> 1457.74s]  everybody gives up, you're fine because like you, you at least got to hang out with your friends
[1457.74s -> 1464.31s]  for a little while. I have a nice iced coffee here. Um, Charlie, what do you want to do in Europe
[1464.31s -> 1471.54s]  here? Glad I held onto that one till I was on the call. I am a big Scandinavia fan. I'm sorry.
[1471.54s -> 1477.50s]  Big Scandinavia fan. I love that for you. Wait. Yeah. Charlie, what if I, what if I give you a
[1477.50s -> 1484.14s]  proposition here? Wait, I messed it up. I didn't click the wrong one. Let me help you get.
[1488.12s -> 1491.00s]  Hear me out. Hear me out. Hear me out. I'm going to show you, look up North.
[1492.04s -> 1497.40s]  We're going to get real, real thin soon. We're going to spread real thin and you can have this
[1497.40s -> 1503.18s]  whole territory and then maybe you just back out of Asia. You see how like these are all ones you,
[1503.18s -> 1510.09s]  I give you a free rain to kill all these troops. Oh, that's very generous. Yeah. You know,
[1510.09s -> 1516.54s]  I just figured it'd be nice. And, uh, and then I get Europe, you get Asia. It's simple deal.
[1518.46s -> 1523.02s]  Let me, let me marinate on it. I'll talk to my board of board of generals. I have fortunate.
[1523.02s -> 1528.14s]  I unfortunately have some bad news to everybody over in North America. Listen, there was a mistake.
[1528.78s -> 1535.13s]  Our alliance was very short-lived. So we've got, I I'm about to potentially have eight troops up
[1535.13s -> 1539.11s]  here and I'm about to come all the way through North America and I would like to be, uh, talked
[1539.11s -> 1546.50s]  down by the way. Uh, please don't do that. I, what if you didn't, uh, the only reason our alliance
[1546.50s -> 1550.98s]  ended was because I thought that your character model was Ludwig. Cause I thought he looked the
[1550.98s -> 1556.50s]  most like Ludwig. That's fair. That's not, that's hurtful to me is I don't think it's fair.
[1556.50s -> 1572.78s]  Are you just fortifying no tax? I don't know. I'm trying to wow. Holy shit. Made a strong enemy
[1572.78s -> 1580.65s]  today. You took Australia. I told you that before the call started, I talked, I typed a DM in
[1580.65s -> 1584.17s]  discord. Hey dude, I don't really know what I'm doing to like, can I have Australia? And you're
[1584.17s -> 1588.65s]  like, yeah, that's cool, bro. And then you just took it. So like, I'm going to attack. I thought
[1588.65s -> 1591.61s]  Africa would be good enough for you. I saw, I'm sorry. I thought, I thought that would be good
[1591.61s -> 1598.26s]  enough. I didn't think you also needed Australia. Clearly you have some British roots here. Never,
[1598.26s -> 1611.22s]  never satisfied. Huh? Didn't you pee on food earlier? I peed and then eat food. Someone did
[1611.22s -> 1618.12s]  say you peed on my food earlier and I was confused why you would do that. There's a lot of people
[1618.12s -> 1625.00s]  really confused right now. All right, Charlie, you're going for America. Oh, you got seven. Oh
[1625.00s -> 1629.34s]  damn. You might be able to clean the whole continent up. Yeah. It's looking good for me.
[1629.34s -> 1634.62s]  I think you can move south and eliminate Connors troops and I'll eliminate Jerma in Greenland for
[1634.62s -> 1640.73s]  you. Don't do that. Well, you, you, you can say you, I'm going to try to, you can't say it's
[1640.73s -> 1645.85s]  guaranteed. We hold strong here in the Western United States. No, this is where I do my best
[1645.85s -> 1655.10s]  work. I'm very patriotic over there. This is a perky 50, 50 chance to go. I feel good about my
[1655.10s -> 1664.06s]  odds here. 50, 50 baby. Oh, so why did I like lose? And I was like three against one. Like I lost
[1664.06s -> 1671.96s]  repeatedly with three against one, but he didn't, he, he didn't lose once. Yeah. He's kind of crazy
[1671.96s -> 1676.60s]  with it. So it's always better to fortify your troops at entry points, which there's a lot of
[1676.60s -> 1679.56s]  in the U S but it's mostly Greenland and you don't have to worry about that. Cause I'm taking care
[1679.56s -> 1687.91s]  of it. I can only, oh, I see it's only adjacent ones. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Okay. I'm going
[1687.91s -> 1695.40s]  to roll the dice. Ludwig. It's not how it works. There we go. All right, Connor, I'll figure this
[1695.40s -> 1717.93s]  out. Don't count me out. Connor. Wouldn't it make more sense to get the south first? You just got
[1717.93s -> 1725.53s]  to trust me here. What a shitty leader this is. I'll make it alive with you. Like, what am I in
[1725.53s -> 1738.60s]  the fucking fourth grade? Like you can't, yeah. I don't know why, uh, I keep doing the thing where
[1738.60s -> 1742.04s]  I put my hand out and when you go to shake it, I like put my hand up and put it over my hair.
[1742.68s -> 1750.12s]  I don't know why I keep doing this to you. It's all right. It happens. What is Earl? I'm taking
[1750.12s -> 1764.58s]  Earl. Uh, I can only move people there apparently. Oh wait, what I wanted to do. You got to break up
[1764.58s -> 1769.54s]  Australia. That's just, just free to troops every time. Okay. You're sitting with Africa
[1769.54s -> 1776.89s]  and you're saying I like, I have a smaller continent. There's like five borders here on
[1776.89s -> 1782.22s]  Africa. You have one that can be attacked. When I tell you I am sitting on an infantry,
[1782.22s -> 1789.10s]  cavalry and artillery, I mean it with the utmost sincerity. Oh, all right. Let's,
[1789.10s -> 1793.42s]  oh, I didn't get the fortify. I see. I see. Now I get it. Let's do this.
[1805.34s -> 1811.43s]  Guys, we might need to, uh, I need to unite here, uh, because look at, look at this is kind of
[1811.43s -> 1816.36s]  getting a little ridiculous. Don't you think? Yeah, it's getting a little scary. I mean, he's,
[1816.36s -> 1823.19s]  he's coming in here. Greenland. Yeah. Yeah. Not worried about him though. Not worried about him.
[1823.19s -> 1829.37s]  He's, he's coming for you, Charlie. Like this is not, he, oh yeah, he is slanderous. Charlie,
[1829.37s -> 1835.45s]  when I am attacking Alaska, I do it with the absolute plan of leaving it for you. All right.
[1835.45s -> 1842.52s]  I'm not even, I'm not even interested anymore. Okay. Fuck. Yeah. Uh, and I'm just going to
[1842.52s -> 1850.97s]  fortify some troops right over. Maybe here's good. It's a good section. I think it is. And
[1851.05s -> 1857.46s]  I insist you get the rest of America here, Charlie. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's the play.
[1857.46s -> 1864.78s]  Can you have your men just stand down? I could do it next turn. Not this turn. Okay. Hey, Ludwig.
[1871.77s -> 1883.83s]  There's no one French. We never surrender. It's our thing. Well, where are all your troops though?
[1883.83s -> 1892.10s]  Oh shit. Tell them German. Where'd they, where'd they go? Thanks. The recent pretty thin there.
[1893.48s -> 1897.48s]  Looking pretty thin. I am looking a little thin, but guess what? I'm not going to let you sit here
[1897.48s -> 1902.60s]  with 11 troops sitting here on the coast. It's not going to happen. You thought I was going to,
[1902.60s -> 1908.44s]  no, they're, they're tourists. We're just passing through the Mediterranean.
[1911.27s -> 1918.95s]  That's a threat. Oh, it very much should be taken that way. Uh, the troops in India,
[1918.95s -> 1926.86s]  there's more of a pacifist nation that happened to have nukes or you understand, uh,
[1927.02s -> 1932.66s]  fellas. He, he's trying to just amass like 30 troops in Europe so then he can just go out
[1932.66s -> 1941.51s]  and just get everybody. This is his plan. I resent this. I took, I got, I got in the way there.
[1941.51s -> 1948.97s]  That's what happened. Charlie. I would throw some troops, take down any, any of my ports.
[1948.97s -> 1954.81s]  They're all for you. You want Greenland or Alaska and the Southern border seems to be the most
[1954.81s -> 1964.23s]  attack and liar. He's a liar. I'm taking the Southern border here. Um, who do I want to
[1964.23s -> 1970.95s]  fight though? He's been like a bully and like a bad guy. I'm an owl. I'm moving my troops out.
[1970.95s -> 1975.94s]  Yeah, no. Yeah. He's given me an, a, we've already formed the Alliance. I think maybe,
[1975.94s -> 1982.70s]  uh, let me just make some moves over here. I'm kind of just being like a annoying notification
[1982.70s -> 1989.53s]  on Connor's phone at this point, but you could get the area in the top, right? That where I am
[1989.53s -> 1995.21s]  because then you'd have the border that connects to the U S. How do I? Oh, you're right. You're
[1995.21s -> 2002.55s]  right. The one that connects to Alaska. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good place. All right. Now
[2002.55s -> 2010.36s]  just hang out and hold on a lot. You get, I think five each turn, right? Yeah. America's juice. I
[2010.36s -> 2022.90s]  think it's one of the biggest outside of Asia, which is impossible to hold. Well, canner,
[2022.90s -> 2031.06s]  canner, a lot of troops in Europe, canner. Oh my God. I could literally. Oh, are you considering
[2031.30s -> 2034.90s]  the whole time was joke? Like, like I've been, I know pinging you out a lot of times, but like
[2036.10s -> 2053.62s]  I've sent you a request. I got this guys. I got a big plan here. I'd recommend. Okay. Fair enough.
[2053.62s -> 2067.32s]  Do you want a recommendation here? Oh, not going for New Zealand. Wait, did you a little too late?
[2068.54s -> 2082.60s]  And I like, I like this guys. Oh no, not Perth though. Huh? Leave Perth alone. How do I go back?
[2082.60s -> 2098.52s]  Uh, you can't unless you're fortify. Oh, they're coming. Charlie. Fortify. Uh, how do I do this?
[2101.64s -> 2105.24s]  The turns are short. Where do I want to go? Yeah. Well, they're 120 seconds. I don't want
[2105.24s -> 2111.85s]  to make it because yeah. Yeah. We're just slow. I mean, I, it's pretty thin though, right? I could
[2111.85s -> 2117.85s]  like just kind of get 10 troops instantly. If I wanted, I could go through Europe. Let's do,
[2117.85s -> 2123.70s]  let's do a play here. I could go down here. Uh huh. Like through here. Oh, two troops. Uh huh.
[2123.70s -> 2128.62s]  Two more. This is so vulnerable though. Like I can't just leave witnessing the plan here.
[2128.62s -> 2139.75s]  It's all right. It's all right. Okay. Well now you're in a lot of trouble because you,
[2139.75s -> 2144.47s]  that plan now you attacked. We're by the way, uh, Connor and I are working together.
[2147.35s -> 2154.41s]  So strong troops down there, Connor. Yeah. They're really energized after we did Argentina.
[2154.41s -> 2159.32s]  Those are the Argentinians that they moved over there. Okay. That's right. It's right. Next turn.
[2159.32s -> 2164.95s]  We're going to go sicko mode. Me and Charlie are going to go crazy. Yeah. That's when we're
[2164.95s -> 2169.90s]  going to get wild. Charlie, check the bottom left to make sure those cards, you might have a,
[2170.62s -> 2174.78s]  yeah, I might have a little something, something to the tank, you know, something to some really
[2174.78s -> 2187.96s]  take out someone else. Let's go. Holy shit. Okay. I'm getting this back. First of all,
[2188.98s -> 2193.46s]  you know what? I now respect you for that. Honestly, I got it as more of a motivation for
[2193.46s -> 2198.58s]  you than anything. I could see that. And by the way, you could request an Alliance if you wanted
[2198.58s -> 2203.83s]  to. I wouldn't mind. Cause I feel like South America is an enemy of both of us. I'm going to
[2203.83s -> 2208.95s]  need a confirmation on that, by the way. We're like, I mean, like I'm just still going. I haven't
[2208.95s -> 2215.51s]  seen a notification on my screen yet. Notification is sent. Notification is sent. Avoid Iceland.
[2215.51s -> 2226.25s]  Okay. Let me, let me think. Oh, okay. Um, I will accept this Alliance. If you can do the first
[2226.33s -> 2236.26s]  one sentence of the four kids, uh, one piece intro, the original intro, the four kids version.
[2236.26s -> 2240.26s]  And I have to sing it. You have to sing it. Just the first, just the first part. I'll,
[2240.26s -> 2244.79s]  that's all I'm looking for. I promise. There was a man named Joel Goldie Roger,
[2244.79s -> 2249.61s]  who was the king of pirates. He was wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
[2249.61s -> 2254.17s]  That's it. These were his final. That's enough. No, no Alliance. What do you mean?
[2254.17s -> 2260.97s]  That's abuse of power. It's abuse of power. I was, I love it. I'm sorry. Honestly,
[2260.97s -> 2265.61s]  I was looking for a yoyo yoyo, but yeah, I didn't get it. That's what the first line then.
[2265.61s -> 2278.49s]  I didn't get what I wanted. It's like the seventh line, like the seventh. I would've
[2278.49s -> 2284.58s]  guy-o-yai-o'd like all day chat. I would've been one of the biggest guy-o-yai-o'ers. Charlie,
[2284.58s -> 2291.40s]  it's your turn. You're, you're, I'm thinking, I'm thinking he actually did the intro.
[2291.48s -> 2297.37s]  The, the, the, all right. I might have to give him another chance. Give it up, give it up.
[2297.37s -> 2318.60s]  What are you heading? He's not attacking anybody. He's been like a nice guy.
[2319.86s -> 2324.42s]  Consolidation. I like that. You could move the three and the four in Europe, or you could move
[2324.42s -> 2333.32s]  the two in America to add to the one, to the five, four, I mean. So it's five? Yeah. Like the,
[2333.32s -> 2340.14s]  the Montreal Mandy's to the California Gary's. Why does it go back? Wait, how do I make it at
[2340.14s -> 2348.90s]  five? I can't move them down. Really? Yeah. Well, that's not, well. That's not bad. So,
[2349.94s -> 2354.10s]  I mean, you guys with the more than three cards, uh, doesn't the amount of troops go up
[2354.66s -> 2360.54s]  each time somebody's not aggressive. It's fixed. Oh, okay. It's fixed. Connor. It seems like you're
[2360.54s -> 2368.50s]  adding a lot of troops around me. Yeah, I am. Ganner. Why? Ganner knew Argentinians are pissed,
[2368.50s -> 2374.26s]  man. I told you. I'm surprised that the guy with the guy from the Yonkis Blinky gift would have a
[2374.26s -> 2384.50s]  Twitch channel. Some of more because we defended our homeland. They're just really upset. There's
[2384.50s -> 2403.19s]  a, that's the one that goes, I've seen it. Consider this. That's right. Wow. Wow. Now you're just
[2403.19s -> 2409.51s]  fighting a fight. We're just going all over. I'm actually kind of getting scared of Connor.
[2410.39s -> 2415.27s]  You've made a grave mistake today. This might be where I turn. This is the heel turn on Connor. I
[2415.27s -> 2432.39s]  think I'm figuring out how to play this game. Um, yeah. Game of Thrones. Connor here. Should I do
[2432.39s -> 2446.31s]  this or should I wait? Let's do it. Let's do it. Only six. I thought it was 10. No, I, I'm holding
[2446.31s -> 2456.92s]  those other 10. Oh, okay. I see for like a later arrangement of sorts. Oh, there's a lot of troop
[2456.92s -> 2467.70s]  movement down there. Easy win. Easy win. They're fighting hard. You've pissed them off. They're
[2467.78s -> 2476.10s]  quite upset. What is going on? You're getting destroyed. That was quite the war. All right.
[2476.10s -> 2508.78s]  Well, all right, man. Well fought. Okay. I should have. You should have what? I, uh, I'm talking
[2508.78s -> 2526.58s]  about, um, thank you for the members. Thank you for the prime. You don't have that. Whoa. Not cool.
[2526.58s -> 2534.65s]  Whoa. Wait, that's my ally. Oh, wait a minute. I want to rethink your allies here. Whoa.
[2535.93s -> 2546.15s]  A bit blood hungry. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I've misclicked. You've misclicked three territories.
[2546.15s -> 2556.06s]  I decide I need new glasses. I think that's the problem. Yeah. But you really need glasses
[2556.06s -> 2565.58s]  if you think you're going to beat me in Greenland or Iceland. Okay. Um, I'm just trying to, uh,
[2566.46s -> 2570.30s]  Connor, sorry. What happened was I forgot to tell you, I was going to send you, uh, you know,
[2570.30s -> 2575.42s]  documents about it that we both signed, um, about how I was going to come through Europe.
[2575.98s -> 2580.22s]  I just did the, uh, the FedEx must have not. I got it there in time. Oh, okay. Yeah. I mean,
[2580.22s -> 2584.97s]  the people would have like appreciated like a little warning. Yeah. Kind of feels to me,
[2584.97s -> 2589.53s]  Connor, from like an outsider's perspective, who's totally unbiased in a journalist in degree
[2589.53s -> 2597.93s]  and nature that he was attacking you and lying. I mean, uh, that would be pretty crazy. Yeah.
[2598.33s -> 2604.92s]  Okay. Honestly, look at the border that you and I have here in, um, South America and Africa.
[2604.92s -> 2608.28s]  I could have just gone, why would I could have gone that way and broke up your points and stuff.
[2608.28s -> 2616.17s]  I just was trying to claim the territory here. I don't understand it. Connor, you come through
[2616.17s -> 2622.44s]  Asia. I, that's all right. I'll let you, uh, that's fine with me. Oh, okay. Really? Yeah.
[2622.44s -> 2631.13s]  Then why did you refortify India to, to the middle East? I will Western us. Let's calm down.
[2631.13s -> 2636.41s]  I would know. Don't bring them all over. Oh, Charlie. No. All the alliances are gone. It seems
[2636.41s -> 2642.12s]  Charlie brought them all over. I would fortify and bring them back. Yeah. I have no, I have
[2642.12s -> 2648.46s]  absolutely no defense against that by the way. 10. No, no, no, no, no. Oh yeah. This is the dream.
[2648.46s -> 2654.82s]  He caught me red fucking handed and I like just didn't talk. So we moving on. I win that. What's
[2654.82s -> 2661.85s]  cool. That's right. It's not over. It's not over. Oh, that's a slaughter. Keep going. All right.
[2661.85s -> 2668.01s]  One more. You're kind of, you're losing every round. There we go. I secret strat is you break
[2668.01s -> 2673.10s]  into their first border so they don't get their bonus. That's bigger. And I like that. Don't go
[2673.10s -> 2682.33s]  down there. Don't go down there. You're out of time. No. Oh, wait. Oh, I see. Oh no. Oh no, Charlie.
[2684.22s -> 2689.85s]  Since you didn't break in, he can't use the three troops that are just big chilling in Peru.
[2689.85s -> 2703.40s]  True. Actually kind of genius of you in a way. Oh God. Wow. That's big. Hmm. He's the reset
[2703.40s -> 2709.96s]  catfish. We're pulling for you by the way, over here in Australia. I appreciate the brothers
[2709.96s -> 2716.73s]  overseas. What is it? I don't know what I'm doing. You're losing. You're losing. Charlie,
[2716.73s -> 2721.61s]  you kind of had a bad draw too. You started like half in Canada, half in Asia. It was kind of a
[2721.61s -> 2726.49s]  hard draw. Yeah. I was saying I got a really bad start, but I've also never played the game. So I
[2726.49s -> 2732.41s]  didn't really do anything right either. I mean, what I'm witnessing is absolute soldiers. Yeah.
[2732.41s -> 2736.89s]  These are warriors here with a pure heart. Fighting the tyranny of oppression. Thanks.
[2746.36s -> 2764.02s]  Um, no. What a mistake. I look over at the camera sometimes and I'm just like,
[2764.02s -> 2769.48s]  I think the Grinch I'm going to do here. Oh, you're going to attack the Argentinians again.
[2769.48s -> 2774.73s]  Yes. Yeah. I bet that will come back to bite you. They're going to piss them off. You're going to
[2774.73s -> 2783.34s]  cross the ocean here. Oh, now they're, now they're living. This is very bad play. You're barely
[2783.34s -> 2786.38s]  going to hold the territory. There's going to be like insurrections everywhere. That's what I say
[2786.38s -> 2790.79s]  to them. I want to talk about bad plays. Check this out. Occupy the whole thing. Check this out.
[2790.79s -> 2807.58s]  Germany eats pants. That's not us. Come on. Nope. Not going to happen. You see what's right next
[2807.58s -> 2813.10s]  to you though. Do you see the big one? Oh, that's right there. That's about to just just steam roll
[2813.10s -> 2825.30s]  all the way through Europe here. I don't, I think that may have been a mistake. No, you're, you're
[2825.30s -> 2836.30s]  dumb. Oh, I could not have been a better car. There's no way we just got that card.
[2836.30s -> 2840.70s]  There's no way we just got that car. Oh guys. I just checked my car. Did you guys see this
[2840.70s -> 2847.64s]  card that I got? Okay. You got one card total. You guys see this card that I'm holding?
[2847.64s -> 2851.64s]  This card is insane. Oh my God. I want to know we hold strong in Portugal.
[2853.05s -> 2858.22s]  We hold strong in the UK. Oh no, this whole thing's coming down, man. I'm sorry.
[2862.33s -> 2873.82s]  We don't budge from Iceland. Are you attacking Connor? Uh, no, don't attack that. That's like,
[2873.82s -> 2877.10s]  I didn't even know. I'm going to be honest. I had nuclear five guys up there. I just learned that.
[2878.46s -> 2882.86s]  I had not seen them the whole game. Okay. Well, I'm going to attack them because they're,
[2882.86s -> 2887.93s]  they're cool. I think. Okay. I'm not going to get the bonus if that exists though.
[2887.93s -> 2893.70s]  So we can like, we'll figure something out. I'll like move them. Okay. All right. Okay. That sounds
[2893.70s -> 2899.27s]  good to me. All right. We all miss click German. That's the thing. Greenland is, is North America,
[2899.27s -> 2903.59s]  right? Technically like it's where, where is it? It's in North America. It's not part of it.
[2903.59s -> 2906.15s]  Well, I'm going to make it so you can't fortify this. Cause I know you're going to turn cards
[2906.15s -> 2909.99s]  in and put like, I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that. Absolutely. What are you going to do?
[2909.99s -> 2915.22s]  So I'm going to go back here. Oh, I get the bonus. If I hold a continent and I'm going to make,
[2915.22s -> 2918.82s]  you have to have the really kind of hard and annoying decision of needing to potentially
[2918.82s -> 2925.53s]  go through Charlie to get over here, which you're not going to do that. Because you guys have an
[2925.53s -> 2935.34s]  Alliance, right? Made a big mistake. Huge history. History will remember your errors.
[2935.34s -> 2944.76s]  Hawaii would never attack the Western United States. Well, I think they're reclaiming it.
[2944.76s -> 2951.14s]  If you want to bail on America and go Asia, Charlie, I wouldn't blame you.
[2951.14s -> 2960.46s]  All right. Well, might as well just hit Japan cause fuck it. Cause your U S is looking thin and
[2960.46s -> 2970.15s]  there's, there's a lot of territories in Asia to win here. Asia is pretty spread out, pretty thin,
[2970.15s -> 2983.53s]  huh? And Europe and Africa. Oh shit. That's all me. I think I'll take care of the Southern
[2983.53s -> 2987.93s]  part of China. If you want to go for the Northern part right now. No, no, no, no, no. Yeah, no
[2987.93s -> 2993.24s]  fortifying. I think it's also good. Why can't I take, oh my God, why can't I take troops from
[2993.24s -> 3002.42s]  there and put them in Japan? Um, it should be able to leave just one wherever you want to,
[3002.42s -> 3022.95s]  if they're connected, that's weird. I just do not understand what's happening. It's called the new
[3022.95s -> 3029.11s]  Argentinians. I don't understand though, like what I'm looking at. Why am I losing? Cause you're
[3029.11s -> 3036.02s]  rolling dice. And if the dice number is lower, I thought it was higher though. Mine were higher
[3036.02s -> 3040.50s]  than those. And there's one like joker die that looks lower, but what is blitz? What does that
[3040.50s -> 3045.54s]  mean? People are saying use blitz. It's like an attack that's just happening right now rolls for
[3045.54s -> 3053.16s]  you automatically. I love it. And instead of don't understand what's happening right now. Oh, okay.
[3053.88s -> 3062.46s]  But it sends all your troops. So it can be devastating if you lose. Oh, okay. I see it's
[3062.46s -> 3073.43s]  just auto attacking. Yeah. Good job. Hey, we're holding up over there. Okay. All right. I just
[3073.43s -> 3078.71s]  need one good card. I don't know why Connor's head hunting me so hard in this one. I don't know. I
[3078.71s -> 3088.31s]  don't get how this works. I just got a clicking or whatever it lets me click on. Uh, I ran out of
[3088.31s -> 3092.79s]  time. I know exactly what he's going to do. He's going to try to come from, he's going to New
[3092.79s -> 3097.27s]  Zealand over. No, I know he's going to do that. I was trying to figure out how to like fortify it.
[3097.27s -> 3104.87s]  I couldn't, I was clicking on the wrong thing. I think my plan is a little deeper than you
[3104.87s -> 3126.02s]  might expect. Okay. What are we doing? You're leaving that. Don't do it. Don't do it. Come on.
[3126.02s -> 3130.86s]  You're not going to make it across. No, no, you're not going to make it across.
[3131.67s -> 3150.18s]  Hmm. Don't do it. Stop right here. Got it. This is perfect. Perfect. I told you not to
[3150.18s -> 3156.76s]  fuck with them. I'm falling apart. Yes. Oh, it's huge though. Oh, next turn. Next turn boys.
[3157.80s -> 3171.86s]  My God, he got, if I could, if I could have, okay. All right. Okay. The good, okay. We've got an idea
[3171.86s -> 3182.63s]  as well. Ludwig, you're actually in a lot of trouble right now. You made a big mistake.
[3182.63s -> 3189.88s]  Huge. I don't know. I don't think so. You don't know how high I can fly. I've seen that movie.
[3189.88s -> 3197.51s]  Hey Charlie, I'm going to let you have Asia if you just say Ludwig sucks. Oh my God. I can't,
[3197.51s -> 3202.07s]  I can't do that. You'll have, you'll have to just take Asia from me. I could never betray an ally.
[3202.87s -> 3211.27s]  You can just have it though. You're not, you're not going to continue. You're not going to,
[3211.27s -> 3224.04s]  it's a mistake to keep going. One more and it's over for you. Whoa. Geez. I'm, I'm just saying
[3224.04s -> 3229.03s]  Ludwig has almost nothing on the board at this point besides Australia down here. So I mean,
[3229.03s -> 3232.55s]  like somebody could literally just swoop in. I mean, like Charlie, I know you have an alliance
[3232.55s -> 3239.03s]  here, but from Japan, if you fortify that you've got a pretty good idea here. I think that's true.
[3239.03s -> 3244.89s]  Well, I'm in a good position strategically. I also control all the anime exports. That's true. We
[3244.89s -> 3250.42s]  have been long time partners in buying a lot of anime up for me. Okay. It's been bye bye bye.
[3250.42s -> 3254.74s]  The trade is heavily in your favor. I wouldn't get rid of me as a partner. Oh no, I completely
[3254.74s -> 3264.97s]  agree. It's been an invaluable partnership. Hey German. Yeah. Did this, this five guys up there
[3264.97s -> 3290.12s]  that would give you Europe. Can I move them to a, to Greenland? Absolutely. We said you're,
[3290.20s -> 3295.26s]  you're fucked. You're all ones. What is it? Look at everybody else though. Like I, I,
[3295.26s -> 3299.42s]  if I get to keep some of these, I'll get a lot of, I'll get a lot of current strongest nation.
[3299.42s -> 3308.52s]  Yep. I'm locking Japan down. There's actually a lot of ways you can go from Japan too. So you,
[3308.52s -> 3318.34s]  that's like a pretty central area. Yeah. It does get Australia, Asia, and us. Yeah. Noticing a lot
[3318.34s -> 3325.72s]  of green on this map fellas. We want to talk about that Connor. Uh, I mean, yeah, he's my ally. He's
[3325.72s -> 3337.96s]  like, cool. What if we make an ally ship? I'll consider my, my words. I feel like I don't think
[3337.96s -> 3345.08s]  so. I haven't even told you what my plan is. What's your plan? You just lost all your troops in that
[3345.08s -> 3351.94s]  fight. They're like, they just really, they just wanted to like show you. I felt like they were
[3351.94s -> 3361.58s]  pissed. Connor, leave me Alberta. No matter what. Oh, thank God. Connor, you gotta, you gotta ask
[3361.58s -> 3367.35s]  for his crunchy roll. Uh, login info. It's cruncher. Oh yeah. What's your country? Oh,
[3370.58s -> 3380.78s]  the price is too heavy. Devastating. Is it here on just Kyra? All right. Uh, this is going to be
[3380.78s -> 3397.50s]  tough for everyone with the record show. I tried dude's got five territories. Well, it's funny
[3397.50s -> 3402.86s]  because I was attacking you. So I feel good about that. Me and Connor are, yeah, he did that.
[3402.86s -> 3420.06s]  Imperialist of you. Is it, oh, is it my turn? Yeah. Oh yeah. And then go ahead and put them in
[3420.06s -> 3431.72s]  New Zealand. I dare you. I dare you to attack Argentina. I dare you. You want, you want to the
[3431.72s -> 3460.58s]  South East back dad or for two, two troops a turn. Okay. You can have it. Psych. Oh, okay. I just did
[3460.58s -> 3471.29s]  like a concerned face in my web. Gotcha. Gotcha. Oh, that's good for me. It's good for me. I can't
[3471.37s -> 3477.19s]  make it to Cape town. It's spreading myself too thin. Plus the more green around me, the worse
[3477.19s -> 3490.94s]  things go more money, more problems. You know what I mean? All right. Uh, Connor, I need to, I need
[3490.94s -> 3498.60s]  this. I need your, yeah. Take the one up there. The little one guy. I don't want to put too much.
[3498.60s -> 3508.23s]  Okay. I gotta hurry up. Yeah. I was giving you the one guy. No, no, no, no, no. What are you doing?
[3510.39s -> 3519.93s]  Times ticking here. Africa. Okay. Please. I don't, I don't want you just steam rolling in here.
[3520.65s -> 3530.62s]  The Falklands will never fall. You just gave them another fun. He's all of Europe and Africa.
[3530.62s -> 3538.86s]  How many, how many is that per turn? Um, it's, it's plus eight. He gets plus eight from that.
[3541.96s -> 3550.98s]  Oh my God. Oh my God. I'm looking at the troop output right now. Connor 18, me 22, Charlie 17,
[3550.98s -> 3559.06s]  Jerma 34. He's got as many as Charlie and Connor combined. How do, uh, how do you finish the game?
[3559.06s -> 3566.04s]  Uh, you don't, you own the world. Somebody has to win. Oh, Charlie. I understand now. I thought
[3566.04s -> 3571.03s]  there was like a turn thing. All it takes is, is yeah, this is where it starts. This is where it
[3571.03s -> 3577.86s]  starts to get kind of, this is where I come as a problem. Big man. I'll take care of South America.
[3577.86s -> 3583.32s]  Okay. I'm going to grab Alaska from you. Yeah, please, please. That's perfect. You got to go
[3583.32s -> 3587.85s]  quick though. You got to go quick. It's perfect. You're fine over here.
[3590.17s -> 3595.93s]  I am. What the use the blitz function. This is, this is, is this not blitz? You're doing
[3595.93s -> 3601.74s]  the individual dice. You got to go right. Oh, bring it back. Bring it back. Oh no. The time
[3602.68s -> 3608.76s]  Charlie, the time. I'm, I'm coming out. What the US time. I'm out. Fortify, fortify. You're good.
[3608.76s -> 3614.12s]  Just for the time. I'm out. Next turn. I don't understand what's happening. You could bring
[3614.12s -> 3621.86s]  him over to Asia. Honestly. It's not a bad idea. Ditch the US. Uh, too late. I got four troops.
[3621.86s -> 3639.45s]  You watch out. Oh no, he just uses cards. Yeah. I used the cards. Um, well then the scariest part
[3639.45s -> 3648.74s]  is Jeremiah's five cards. You should not be scared. That was the most terrifying thing you've ever said.
[3648.74s -> 3655.21s]  You should have heard your tone right there. Was it scary? Yeah. Oh, it's like a horror movie.
[3655.21s -> 3665.62s]  You're like, you should not be scared. You know, I've never won a game of risk in my whole life.
[3667.85s -> 3672.25s]  Really? Never. Cause the way you're playing Connor for a fool right now
[3672.25s -> 3679.75s]  makes me double check that. Where did you get that from? Are you kidding me?
[3681.58s -> 3687.21s]  You have him as your, as he gave you Falkland islands. He has no territory of two. It's been
[3687.21s -> 3694.18s]  the worst partnership in the history of partnerships. I've seen worse. Well, no, I, I, South America,
[3694.18s -> 3699.00s]  Connor's held South America for like the whole entire game. I haven't gone over there.
[3699.00s -> 3708.04s]  We've been trading stuff here with honor. Western us. All right. I have to make this move
[3708.04s -> 3715.85s]  for the betterment of my people. That's a little cringe. Everybody's cringing at you. Like all the
[3715.85s -> 3721.64s]  viewers actually it's kind of ridiculous. Yeah. Well, everybody's like looking at you funny right
[3721.64s -> 3726.33s]  now. They're not doing that. Okay. It's getting really weird looks. I mean, I don't feel like
[3726.33s -> 3732.73s]  that's the, I hope that's not the case. I just got to text my mom. Let's say Ludwig is cringe.
[3733.45s -> 3740.10s]  I feel like your mom was saying that. Send that message. I mean, she's not, she's not,
[3740.10s -> 3748.28s]  she's wrong. I mean, first of all, I, I think so. Happy Easter. Have a good Easter. I agree.
[3748.28s -> 3753.16s]  And then they're like, they're like tongue hanging out crazy. They like the face, right?
[3753.72s -> 3759.19s]  You don't use emojis like that with your mom. What you use the tongue out, crazy face emoji
[3759.19s -> 3769.11s]  in a casual conversation to your mom. It's kind of like a silly emoji. I feel like that one's fine.
[3769.11s -> 3774.68s]  It's like that. A ha ha X D. I've seen my mom use that emoji. You know, the one,
[3774.68s -> 3784.15s]  do I have to post it in chat? Jeremy, it's your turn. You said the emote before.
[3784.15s -> 3789.38s]  Hold on. I got, oh, you don't, that's you wasting time here. I just wanted to see it by the way.
[3795.38s -> 3798.26s]  I'm not fucking around. No, we win this fight. We win this fight. No, you don't.
[3800.66s -> 3806.68s]  Yes. They did pretty good there. Very well fought group.
[3808.12s -> 3815.27s]  For Jakarta fight blast.
[3816.79s -> 3821.40s]  Thanks for not breaking the Alliance, man. The people there appreciate it.
[3824.76s -> 3832.97s]  It was huge. It was huge. We can stomp Connor out of the Americas.
[3833.53s -> 3840.95s]  Yeah, that's the plan. But I've also got good strats. Oh, I love this Japan to all Mike,
[3840.95s -> 3846.79s]  the wrap around Alaska. Oh, the door reach around. We're gonna be all right. Hey,
[3846.79s -> 3851.74s]  oh, everything's fine. Are you assured me you assured me that you were going to be able to
[3851.74s -> 3858.17s]  handle North America? No, I said I'd be able to handle Argentina. And then that didn't work
[3858.17s -> 3866.31s]  very long. I said, actually, I said the Falklands. And to be fair, they're still there. They are.
[3866.31s -> 3874.18s]  They are actually still there. Oh, this is actually kind of bad. You left Mexico.
[3874.18s -> 3878.34s]  Wait, how do I go? Wait, I can't go back. No, you can only get the like when you were traveling
[3878.34s -> 3883.62s]  north, you had to have left troops in eastern US. Oh, what the fuck? It's OK. It's OK. I'll
[3883.62s -> 3888.33s]  sweep through. I'll sweep through. I'll finish the job. I'll finish the job. Chin up, King.
[3888.33s -> 3893.21s]  It was a great fight. My Argentinian troops will will will demolish him.
[3893.21s -> 3910.06s]  He will only have Asia as his frontier. I'm lucky. You got cards. All right. All right.
[3910.06s -> 3937.32s]  There we go. There we go. There we go. This really decides the how the game is going to play out
[3937.32s -> 3953.43s]  here. However this goes. It's an error. It's an error. Oh, an absolute wonder. Oh, yes. Oh,
[3953.43s -> 3958.97s]  that's bad. Oh, you shouldn't fight this honor. You shouldn't fight this.
[3958.97s -> 3963.61s]  Oh, what if like I did? I don't know. These are some rabid warriors out here.
[3963.61s -> 3976.62s]  I don't know what they're capable of. I don't know why I feel like you're eating with your
[3976.62s -> 3984.73s]  hands right now. Like you're eating like chicken with your hands. You get one giant turkey leg
[3984.73s -> 3988.33s]  that they serve at Disneyland. I just have it here. You're just like sitting there eating like
[3988.33s -> 3991.93s]  chicken wings. You got like barbecue sauce all over your hands. Is that is that accurate or
[3991.93s -> 3996.79s]  I'm not even holding the bone. That's the worst part. I'm just holding the meat part of it.
[3996.79s -> 4007.24s]  Um, Gemma, Gemma, Gemma, you have made several errors today. You're probably aware of that,
[4007.24s -> 4018.78s]  though. Someone said Ludwig is 100% a Disney adult. Not not a Disney adult. I just happened
[4018.78s -> 4028.60s]  to go to Disney a lot. Man. Whoa, chill. Oh, leave him alone, man. Charlie, I leave you the
[4028.60s -> 4036.87s]  rest of North America to take care of. All right. That was too far that you're going to go three
[4036.87s -> 4041.77s]  v three. No, you're not. That would be weird. That was too far. I don't even need to as a
[4041.77s -> 4047.19s]  thing about it. That was a little cringe is what people are saying. You check my phone.
[4048.39s -> 4055.29s]  Don't check your phone again. It's a mess from Dad. No, it's not. What do you say? I can't get
[4055.29s -> 4060.23s]  into my email. I need help getting back into my email account. I don't fucking know. But like,
[4060.23s -> 4065.11s]  okay, just regular. That's not bad. That's not bad. My dad said Ludwig is cringe. That's not
[4066.34s -> 4072.73s]  at the exact same time he happened to message you said coincidentally in the exact same minute
[4072.73s -> 4078.09s]  that German father takes a German coincidence. I mean, things happen. It's an awfully large
[4078.09s -> 4083.29s]  coincidence. You don't dare. All right. I'm here. You don't dare do this. German. There's a prime
[4083.29s -> 4091.54s]  Keebler. Hey, German. How about an alliance? Hey, okay. Hey, what's going on here? What is it?
[4091.54s -> 4098.36s]  What is it? Connor failed you in the southern front. I can hold South America and leave you
[4098.36s -> 4105.32s]  Africa. I will also heed Europe to you. I won't interrupt you. Leave me some don't believe his
[4105.32s -> 4109.48s]  lies. I'm not even gonna listen at all. I mean, this is just like the tone of your voice was like,
[4109.48s -> 4115.16s]  I'm doing I'm making this up. Yeah, I heard the tone of your voice was I'm making this up.
[4115.16s -> 4120.81s]  I will literally sing any song you want. If you don't go any further. I would actually take that
[4120.81s -> 4123.45s]  deal. That's firework, firework, firework right now.
[4139.93s -> 4148.68s]  All right. Thank you. Welcome. All right. I'm satisfied.
[4149.64s -> 4158.47s]  What is it? Do you have a pepe pains on YouTube? Oh, yeah, we got that. Yeah, I'm seeing mostly
[4158.47s -> 4162.07s]  feel strong. Man's over here, though. What do you bring it up? People are there's a lot of pepe
[4162.07s -> 4166.55s]  pains. Right, right, right, right. Next time he's gonna have to drink a glass of milk when he does
[4166.55s -> 4180.57s]  the two at the same time. Otherwise, I'm invading. Hey, Charlie, what about an alliance? Charlie,
[4180.57s -> 4185.78s]  you got to get rid of that five. Yeah, you could you could attack on both six fronts, though.
[4185.78s -> 4191.30s]  Like you could pepper him down with the Alberta troops. Finish him off with the with the Montreal
[4191.30s -> 4196.66s]  there. They'll stand strong. I'm going in. Oh, no, they're good. You win this. They're strong
[4196.66s -> 4204.89s]  boys. They're strong. That's us. Oh, really? I can't stand strong, Mexico. The only thing you
[4204.89s -> 4210.82s]  can do is leave nothing but Mexico. Honor, I'm gonna have to eat you. You're gonna have to what
[4210.82s -> 4215.43s]  I'm gonna have to eat you. I think I'm gonna have to eat you. You might have to, but I think
[4215.67s -> 4220.39s]  I'll be okay. I think so. It depends. It really depends what's going on here, because if somebody
[4220.39s -> 4228.49s]  kills you, they get your cards. Well, I don't have any good cards. I mean, look, if I if I consume you,
[4228.49s -> 4233.13s]  I might get a match and then I could take them both on. How are you even like handling this
[4233.13s -> 4240.71s]  negotiation? You said ooh to him eating you. Yeah. I mean, we lost the Falklands. We're kind of like
[4240.71s -> 4246.15s]  low morale. I mean, you could do if you get something to do in Asia here, maybe. But I'm afraid
[4246.15s -> 4250.71s]  that Charlie's gonna eat you and then you get Charlie's gonna get your cards. All right. That's
[4250.71s -> 4256.25s]  fair. What do you mean? This is for he's eating you and you're saying that's fair. Well, the Falkland,
[4256.25s -> 4262.57s]  we lost the Falklands, man. You lost his will to fight. This is Stockholm syndrome. You lost to
[4262.57s -> 4272.06s]  German and now you're saying it's fair that he eats you. I miss them. Japan, let's go. I hate you.
[4272.06s -> 4279.34s]  Honor, I'm gonna have to eat you. I don't like Japan, guys. All right, guys, I'm gonna fortify
[4279.34s -> 4287.58s]  here. Can I just like, can I like get like a boat and like move all of Asia to Mexico?
[4288.78s -> 4293.48s]  Just get everybody out somewhere. There's the boat card. I think you actually might be okay.
[4293.48s -> 4307.18s]  You actually might be okay. If you go down to like two territories though, Connor, I might have to
[4307.18s -> 4323.80s]  eat you. No, that's fair. Yes! All right, but you lost a lot. You lost a ton. I don't even want to
[4323.80s -> 4329.10s]  hear your words. The people of the southeast hate you, Ludwig, and you think you're a terrible leader.
[4329.18s -> 4333.32s]  You just killed like all of them. You know, nobody even in Australia fucking even watches
[4333.32s -> 4346.81s]  your stream. Like, they watch my stream. No, many Australians enjoy content. I just think it's
[4346.81s -> 4361.05s]  bullshit. They don't even have TikTok there. Okay, all right. This is so ugly. There's so many ways
[4361.05s -> 4368.33s]  I can get. I've got to go for this. If I can get this done, then I can get it done. I'm gonna try.
[4374.34s -> 4392.28s]  Yeah, there it goes. I've got to go for it. Nice. Oh, defend the Mexican border.
[4392.28s -> 4402.90s]  If you attack, I return. You're gonna attack anyways. Hang strong, Americans. I don't know
[4402.90s -> 4410.95s]  if I want to do this though. If you push America, that is my ally. Oh, I think I could get the game
[4410.95s -> 4421.06s]  now. When I kept fighting, I kept losing everybody. You kept just having one person in a whole area
[4421.06s -> 4426.10s]  and you'd have a huge area with one troop max. I thought people wouldn't feel threatened. They'd
[4426.10s -> 4438.01s]  be like, oh, there's just one guy there. Can I trust you to handle Greenland, Charlie? I don't
[4438.01s -> 4444.33s]  know if I can take Greenland just yet. I think I'm going to just need to grab Mexico first.
[4444.33s -> 4451.51s]  All right, grab Mexico and amass troops. I will distract Jerma. How are you going to do that?
[4451.51s -> 4472.38s]  You have some kind of plan. I trust the one guy there. Imagine this one dude beats six troops.
[4472.38s -> 4486.84s]  All right. Wow, he fought valiantly. Jesus. He did a good job. He died with honor. Oh, I have a
[4486.84s -> 4494.63s]  plan chat and it is, it's merciless actually. Honor, you have an opportunity to, here is,
[4494.63s -> 4498.65s]  here's the play. I'm going to tell you what the play is or do you want it back and forth here?
[4498.65s -> 4508.34s]  Let me play. If you go after Charlie right now and thin him out, I could eat him. That's true.
[4508.34s -> 4515.69s]  All right. I could go across North America, get those cards and I could get your cards too.
[4515.77s -> 4522.94s]  It's good. It's not good. His plan always involves killing you and you keep saying it's good.
[4522.94s -> 4540.62s]  That's diplomacy. We lost our will. You're like a robot. Hang strong Hawaii. Yeah, go team.
[4541.94s -> 4546.42s]  I'm just being real. Okay. If Connor had the territories that I have, I would be saying,
[4546.42s -> 4552.41s]  I'd be like, look, come get the cards from me and go on and our alliance can go on to victory.
[4552.41s -> 4556.76s]  It won't even give me an option to fortify. There's nothing to fortify. It's all a bunch
[4556.76s -> 4563.48s]  of one guy. Connor, it's been a pleasure playing with you. You're not going to knock me out this
[4563.48s -> 4571.94s]  turn. Everybody would be like, that's cringe Ludwig if you did that. Oh, that's a lot though.
[4574.74s -> 4582.92s]  28 guys. That's not cool. Don't do it. He's got to go. He's got to do all of this. He's
[4582.92s -> 4586.10s]  going to spread out. So you're going to know it's not going to happen. You got to like leave me
[4586.10s -> 4594.06s]  Hawaii. I don't, you never deserved Hawaii. You got to leave me like, uh, what is this?
[4599.85s -> 4610.23s]  You got to leave that one. You got this guys. All right. That was kind of cringe.
[4610.23s -> 4633.06s]  A lot of people are cringing. Wait, I believe the lime. Wait, I don't even have an avatar.
[4633.06s -> 4640.94s]  I thought the question mark was like mechanic. I don't even have a guy. It's your cards. I'll
[4640.94s -> 4646.62s]  send gas can of fun requests on my way out. Wait, it made me leave the game. Wait, it kicked you
[4646.62s -> 4651.88s]  out of the game. I think, I think you should be able to spectate now unless I probably just
[4651.88s -> 4658.76s]  clicked the wrong thing. I can just hear him on discord if you want. You guys ready for this one?
[4658.76s -> 4668.36s]  What's your big plan? My big plan is this. No, Charlie. Jesus Christ. I'm sorry, Charlie. I
[4669.56s -> 4673.08s]  have to go this way. Just about to save America. I'm really torn up about it,
[4673.08s -> 4682.98s]  Jerma. Oh God. Are you sub king? Even in death, he thinks a soldier is king. Oh, petty, petty.
[4682.98s -> 4688.84s]  It is. It's very petty, but I don't want you to get the bonus for this. Oh, grow up. Also Peru.
[4688.84s -> 4700.30s]  What is that for? What are you doing? Just to fuck with you. I regret that. Yes. Yes. We still have
[4700.30s -> 4714.39s]  a chance. I want to make sure I don't do this wrong. You, what if you defend this? I'd laugh
[4714.39s -> 4729.45s]  so hard. You might actually might come on boys for lovely lady liberty. Hey, can you give me like
[4729.45s -> 4738.30s]  500 subs? Expand upon that idea. It's like a joke. No, it doesn't sound great. I feel like after your
[4738.30s -> 4743.03s]  dad called me cringe too. I feel like no, he's like, he doesn't know what twitch is. He doesn't get it.
[4743.03s -> 4750.14s]  Jerma, you made a big mistake. I get to come back. Jerma, you made a big mistake. Wait, what happened?
[4750.14s -> 4753.10s]  What happened? What happened? What happened? What's going on? You ran out of time. What do you mean
[4753.10s -> 4759.86s]  run out of time? Where should I go? Where should I go? Charlie should fortify one area as much as
[4759.86s -> 4766.42s]  possible. Yep. And, and it shouldn't be, it should be an area. Leave, leave Western US. I'm going to
[4766.42s -> 4770.82s]  adopt that and I'm going to attack his 10 troop. You should try to attack his 11 if you can. If you
[4770.82s -> 4775.14s]  can't escape to South America, I will give you refuge there. Yeah. I think I'm just going to
[4775.14s -> 4782.63s]  head to South America. Head to South America. I'll protect you. All right. Thank you. Here I come.
[4782.63s -> 4787.67s]  Or you can fight 11 and 11. I'm flabbergasted right now. I don't, would this help you Ludd?
[4787.67s -> 4792.15s]  If I did 11 and 11. It would help me vanquish the rest of him. Yeah. Cause I'll take the 10 on.
[4792.15s -> 4797.21s]  I can't, it's impossible. I was winning. We stay in fight. All right. I'm not a bitch.
[4797.21s -> 4805.85s]  This is for you Ludd. We stay in fight. Our alliance. Okay. All right. Okay. All right.
[4807.37s -> 4812.49s]  It's not that bad. It's not that bad. It was a good fight. It's, it was, it, this is winnable.
[4813.13s -> 4818.49s]  Yeah. So now you just need to protect, uh, Mexico for me, which I will, which I will.
[4818.49s -> 4823.10s]  Mother fucker is going to, he's going to eat you, Charlie. And he's going to get all your cards.
[4823.10s -> 4827.26s]  No, he just, he's going to go up to the Western United States. He's going to,
[4827.26s -> 4831.42s]  he's going to strike you from there. I can't believe I ran out of time.
[4831.42s -> 4849.14s]  That was some very sad art. We go here. Ooh. Why is there a hard stone timer on risk? It takes a
[4849.14s -> 4853.62s]  minute to figure out where you're going to go. First of all, I agree. We're getting, we're getting
[4853.62s -> 4858.02s]  roped, our stone roped in the game. Game would have looked a lot different if I had more time.
[4858.02s -> 4868.79s]  Fuck. All right. Charlie. Just leave me Mexico. It's all I need. That's such, I fucking have that
[4868.79s -> 4876.15s]  win. I've win that. That's so fucking stupid. Charlie, if I let you live, he's going to kill you
[4876.15s -> 4881.88s]  and win the game. You don't know that. You don't know that Ludd. Charlie. I don't have any cards
[4881.88s -> 4885.72s]  by the way. I use them on my last turn. I will not kill you. I will not kill you.
[4886.76s -> 4894.17s]  I've been in this spot, Charlie. I will do everything. You had value. I have nothing for
[4894.17s -> 4901.66s]  you. I have nothing for you. I will protect you. I'm going to come through here and I will not,
[4901.66s -> 4908.62s]  I promise I will not consume that one area that you have. All I need is Mexico. I did,
[4908.62s -> 4911.50s]  I didn't, I didn't kill you, Charlie. I left you alive as you can see.
[4911.98s -> 4915.85s]  Thank you. Charlie, I'm leaving you alive. Oh, thank you.
[4917.53s -> 4930.20s]  Like so desperately. Okay. I have this timer. What's your plan, wise guy? You are not leaving
[4930.20s -> 4937.00s]  him alive. You're lying. Holy shit. You lie. You're not allowed to lie in war.
[4937.00s -> 4940.52s]  It's one of the war crimes. The major one. Yeah. That's a Geneva convention.
[4941.96s -> 4944.52s]  Charlie's going to kill you. He's going to kill you. No, he's not. He wouldn't.
[4945.08s -> 4949.40s]  So he's be lining towards you with heat, but he's going to stop. It's like, it's like when
[4949.40s -> 4953.00s]  Godzilla was destroying the city, but then they all held hands and he's like, all right,
[4953.00s -> 4971.45s]  I'm done here. No, you're not thinking about man of my word. Oh my God. Thank you.
[4972.84s -> 4977.18s]  We in New Mexico, in Mexico. Thank you. Might as well be New Mexico at this point.
[4977.18s -> 4989.05s]  It's been shifted around so much. All right. So I just want to make sure that we're aware that I,
[4989.69s -> 4994.81s]  I left you alive. I could have taken your cards. That's right. That's right. I won't forget. Well,
[4994.81s -> 4998.65s]  let's not forget about who left you alive in the first place. I, I border surrounding you.
[4998.65s -> 5002.81s]  We've had an alliance for years now. I know we've been tight for a long time.
[5002.81s -> 5007.24s]  He was whining about that though. He was like, Oh, but Charlie, like, I don't know. He's going
[5007.24s -> 5011.32s]  to go up there next term. That was what he said. You remember that? I do remember that.
[5012.04s -> 5015.96s]  We're just happy existing out here. Honestly, we're just happy. We're just happy to be here.
[5015.96s -> 5021.10s]  By the way, if you attack, uh, Charlie here, Ludwig, that's a declaration of war
[5021.10s -> 5039.80s]  across everywhere else for me. Is that right? It's only two of the,
[5039.80s -> 5044.04s]  we'd be the only two remaining. Of course it would be, we'd be declaring war on each other.
[5045.72s -> 5052.26s]  Ludwig, you play this game like a nerd. You just got to put everybody in one spot.
[5052.26s -> 5057.58s]  I don't think that's what you got to do necessarily. How cool guys play it.
[5057.58s -> 5064.47s]  Are you cool guys? Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. Yeah. Thanks for completing the gift con or
[5064.47s -> 5101.90s]  five steps challenge super. Really? No, you don't. Okay. Whoa. Holy shit.
[5101.90s -> 5105.66s]  Wait, how did they move that way? They, they can go across any territories
[5105.66s -> 5114.90s]  that connect. And so they went all the way across through, uh, Madagascar or, uh, New Zealand.
[5114.90s -> 5123.43s]  So, but I couldn't move people on a boat from the North of Asia to Mexico. Okay. Sure. That's fine.
[5123.43s -> 5130.36s]  No, you're not chairman. You wouldn't. I'm trying. I'm thinking you're thinking
[5130.36s -> 5135.40s]  about killing a Mexican army. No, he's not. That's not going across his mind. He's looking at,
[5135.40s -> 5139.80s]  he's, he's looking at going for you. I went through Hawaii. I'm just concerned.
[5139.80s -> 5143.16s]  He's thinking about six, six in Hawaii. I don't think he's thinking about that.
[5143.16s -> 5146.04s]  Well, I'm concerned about Hawaii because you have a, you can just walk right in.
[5147.75s -> 5151.91s]  Exactly. Hawaii is a big threat. Hawaii is pretty threatening.
[5153.54s -> 5160.73s]  Why are you? Are you going to be kidding me? Are you kidding me? I lost seven troops and you lost two.
[5163.05s -> 5169.26s]  Unbelievable. Okay. Don't worry. We in Mexico won't forget that.
[5170.06s -> 5174.22s]  Charlie, I want, what I want you to do is I want you to attack me. So you get a card,
[5174.22s -> 5178.38s]  but then you might get a turn in the next round and then you might be able to clean this up
[5178.38s -> 5182.50s]  because he's going to kill me next turn. I think. Okay. All right. Come up through North America.
[5183.14s -> 5191.45s]  All right. I'll, I'll swing through. What are you doing? No, no, no. I'm not. I don't want to.
[5192.25s -> 5197.77s]  Oh my God. That was scary. Oh my God. Mexico was on high alert right there.
[5197.77s -> 5202.57s]  People of Mexico are freaking out. All right. I'm coming. So I, I, what do you,
[5202.57s -> 5204.89s]  what do you need me to take from you? The Western United States,
[5205.85s -> 5209.45s]  whatever you can get here to be able to fortify. Cause he's going to come for both of us right now.
[5209.53s -> 5213.93s]  I'm not coming for Charlie. He's making it in us against. I'm not against you, Charlie. I've done
[5213.93s -> 5219.90s]  nothing to protect you since day one. So what do I need to get a card? You need to get one
[5219.90s -> 5223.82s]  area. It doesn't matter what area, any area at all. Winning it gives you a question.
[5223.82s -> 5227.22s]  Okay. I'm just going to take this one for the card then. And I'm going to
[5227.22s -> 5234.07s]  bring all of my boys back to Mexico. I can't do that. I see. Okay. Now you can't,
[5234.07s -> 5240.12s]  if you end the attack and then you do fortify, I think. Right. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nice.
[5240.68s -> 5245.90s]  Big strat, big strat. Then you've got an opportunity after this.
[5247.10s -> 5250.54s]  Little guy's cheat engine and I'm watching his screen. He's like seeing different numbers.
[5250.54s -> 5260.82s]  It's the overlay. Show your task manager right now. 36. Oh boy. This is bad.
[5260.82s -> 5270.97s]  The Congo will hold strong. It's just got Asia. Asia is what? Eight.
[5271.61s -> 5279.42s]  As we can't let Lederich win. He's like, not cool guys.
[5282.34s -> 5284.98s]  Mexico will be the last place standing. Mark my words.
[5285.78s -> 5289.74s]  That's my dream. My dream is that I don't get all the areas. I get
[5289.74s -> 5293.48s]  all of them except for Mexico. A perfect world.
[5293.48s -> 5297.82s]  And then you have a car turn in and you just wipe out everything, Charlie.
[5297.82s -> 5314.76s]  I do. I did get a card out of that. I wonder if you have it.
[5314.76s -> 5320.90s]  Ludwig, are you trying to kill me this turn? What? No.
[5320.90s -> 5324.98s]  South Africa hold. You're going to do it. I think you're going to kill me this turn.
[5326.94s -> 5328.78s]  Sure, ma. He's going to be okay.
[5329.58s -> 5335.58s]  You got that five down south that it's a little too strong at the moment, but your time will come.
[5335.58s -> 5341.14s]  Wipe me out. Leave me that one. Yeah. Leave me the one.
[5342.98s -> 5353.56s]  You have a few here. Well, let him give a bunch of ones on the map.
[5353.56s -> 5366.07s]  Looks really stupid. That was noble.
[5371.32s -> 5378.46s]  I'm going to try to block him from coming this way. All right.
[5378.46s -> 5383.61s]  Do you have a turn in? I missed it by one, but don't we have heart.
[5383.61s -> 5386.25s]  We have heart here. I'm okay.
[5386.25s -> 5393.93s]  If you can kill me, you probably should because you can take a, he can take a South America.
[5393.93s -> 5400.74s]  Oh my God. I can take South America and it's my, it's the only thing I can do here.
[5400.74s -> 5406.30s]  Oh my God. I'm abandoning Mexico. I'm coming.
[5407.62s -> 5409.22s]  It's in the back for Charlie.
[5409.22s -> 5411.30s]  No, I can't. I can't.
[5411.30s -> 5413.46s]  Charlie, you attack me here and it's done.
[5413.46s -> 5416.98s]  But you're going to kill me anyway. You don't really, you don't care about Mexico.
[5418.98s -> 5421.69s]  But if you come for me, I'm coming for you.
[5421.69s -> 5424.92s]  I have no choice. I'm coming. I'm fleeing.
[5426.62s -> 5429.50s]  It's not just going to be the Mexicans. It is.
[5429.50s -> 5433.24s]  It'll be the Western Californians, the Nova Scotians.
[5435.80s -> 5437.24s]  I'm going to get everyone, Charlie.
[5438.60s -> 5439.56s]  That's okay. That's okay.
[5440.44s -> 5444.04s]  I'm the psycho though, right? From the beginning. Remember I was the one.
[5458.36s -> 5460.28s]  I drew Exodia.
[5460.28s -> 5461.56s]  30 of them.
[5461.56s -> 5469.11s]  I'm telling you, I'm going to be the last guy here over in Canada with a stick in my hand.
[5469.11s -> 5469.91s]  Final words, Charlie?
[5471.05s -> 5472.25s]  Mexico won't fall.
[5474.06s -> 5474.70s]  Let's find out.
[5478.39s -> 5483.30s]  Oh, no, no one's even like trying to fight.
[5484.62s -> 5487.02s]  Just wait, watch Mexico. It's going to go from 18 to 10.
[5487.74s -> 5491.40s]  It's going to be such a noble battle.
[5491.40s -> 5492.52s]  Let's go Mexico.
[5496.04s -> 5498.50s]  Hey, they got their one. They did their part.
[5499.46s -> 5500.50s]  It's been a pleasure, Charlie.
[5501.30s -> 5502.34s]  We don't know it's over yet.
[5503.22s -> 5505.14s]  Oh, the Western. No.
[5512.06s -> 5513.42s]  That's so many cards.
[5513.42s -> 5518.68s]  Yeah, this is bad.
[5518.68s -> 5519.40s]  Oh, please.
[5519.40s -> 5520.04s]  That's cringe.
[5523.56s -> 5524.28s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[5524.28s -> 5526.76s]  It just sent me back to the main menu.
[5526.76s -> 5527.88s]  Yeah, that happened to me too.
[5527.88s -> 5529.24s]  A little bit streaming in a distant.
[5536.36s -> 5537.72s]  I can just pull up this stream.
[5537.72s -> 5539.00s]  I won't be able to put this on screen.
[5543.00s -> 5544.04s]  Oh, you want to do it?
[5545.54s -> 5546.74s]  You're going to leave that?
[5546.74s -> 5548.42s]  Just you're going to leave Canada there?
[5549.06s -> 5550.02s]  That's cringe, Ludwig.
[5551.77s -> 5554.47s]  Give you one turn.
[5554.47s -> 5558.81s]  All right.
[5558.81s -> 5564.09s]  Like the four of us are just going to run at you with like pots and pans and sticks and rocks.
[5564.81s -> 5565.29s]  Here we go.
[5568.28s -> 5569.40s]  A bunch of polar bears.
[5570.46s -> 5570.94s]  Let's go.
[5574.09s -> 5574.59s]  Ow.
[5575.61s -> 5578.70s]  Well, we got nowhere to go.
[5578.70s -> 5579.20s]  GG.
[5579.74s -> 5580.24s]  GG.
[5580.78s -> 5587.37s]  People saying this is so humiliating.
[5589.19s -> 5589.83s]  No, it's not.
[5591.91s -> 5594.39s]  This is exactly why I invited all three of them to play.
[5595.90s -> 5597.82s]  At least that was a gross test of results.
[5606.39s -> 5607.67s]  I can't believe I ran out of time.
[5608.39s -> 5608.89s]  GG.
[5609.35s -> 5611.11s]  Yeah, the running out of time was it, right?
[5611.11s -> 5612.95s]  You definitely win if you don't.
[5612.95s -> 5614.09s]  I don't know if I would have won.
[5614.65s -> 5616.65s]  If you betray Charlie and kill him, you win for sure.
[5617.90s -> 5618.70s]  I was hoping.
[5618.70s -> 5620.38s]  You don't really win with that.
[5624.60s -> 5628.42s]  Your friend invites everybody to play their favorite game and he just kicks everybody's ass.
[5628.42s -> 5629.70s]  And then like everybody's like,
[5630.42s -> 5632.42s]  we're around, but he's having a great time.
[5632.42s -> 5635.74s]  And so we're just happy to be here.
[5635.74s -> 5636.14s]  Yeah.
[5636.14s -> 5637.66s]  Yeah, that's kind of what I'm going for.
[5639.59s -> 5641.11s]  Do you guys want to do another one?
[5641.11s -> 5643.21s]  That's just the US.
[5643.21s -> 5643.93s]  I'm down.
[5643.93s -> 5645.61s]  Yes, just the US.
[5645.61s -> 5647.05s]  Yeah, it's just the US.
[5647.05s -> 5648.17s]  Why is this clickering?
[5648.17s -> 5650.01s]  It breaks it up by states though.
[5650.01s -> 5650.65s]  Oh, okay.
[5652.06s -> 5656.18s]  And I'll increase our turn timer is actually 90 seconds to 120.
[5656.18s -> 5659.69s]  Do you want to try manual placement for this one?
[5659.69s -> 5661.13s]  Let's do it for the United States one.
[5661.13s -> 5662.17s]  That should shouldn't be that.
[5662.17s -> 5662.67s]  Yeah.
[5665.18s -> 5666.54s]  Is progressive card bonus better?
[5666.54s -> 5669.10s]  You were mentioning that that is what you usually play.
[5669.10s -> 5675.48s]  Games end a lot quicker because it goes from like three to like six all the way up to 30.
[5675.48s -> 5676.04s]  I think.
[5676.04s -> 5677.96s]  Are you making a new game?
[5677.96s -> 5678.60s]  Yeah.
[5678.60s -> 5680.70s]  Should I do fog of war?
[5680.70s -> 5681.98s]  It seems kind of interesting.
[5681.98s -> 5683.30s]  Oh, that work.
[5683.30s -> 5686.98s]  It limits a visibility of territories to only the ones around you.
[5686.98s -> 5688.66s]  So you don't know who owns what else.
[5688.66s -> 5689.54s]  That sounds awesome.
[5690.95s -> 5693.83s]  I will do progressive fog of war on and manual placement.
[5693.83s -> 5695.03s]  We're going to get crazy here.
[5695.03s -> 5699.74s]  Oh, I got to fix my steam real quick.
[5699.74s -> 5700.22s]  Oh, yeah.
[5700.22s -> 5701.26s]  Yeah, please do.
[5701.26s -> 5702.62s]  Please make sure that should work.
[5703.18s -> 5705.50s]  I'm going to put the code in our group chat.
[5705.50s -> 5706.66s]  Very good.
[5706.66s -> 5713.27s]  I just spent five tokens to join.
[5713.27s -> 5717.16s]  Jeremy, you don't really read your chat and listen to them a lot, right?
[5717.16s -> 5717.90s]  It depends.
[5717.90s -> 5718.86s]  Yeah, I like that.
[5718.86s -> 5719.90s]  I do sometimes.
[5719.90s -> 5720.30s]  Why?
[5720.30s -> 5721.10s]  Oh, okay.
[5721.10s -> 5725.02s]  Well, I just open it up and I see people saying like, oh, I'm instantly go Ludwig,
[5725.02s -> 5727.96s]  you know, but like passes in the past.
[5727.96s -> 5729.64s]  No, I mean, I were saying that.
[5729.64s -> 5733.51s]  It's a new game.
[5733.51s -> 5735.43s]  Guys, let's keep the letter gate to minimum, guys.
[5735.43s -> 5736.15s]  He's a cool guy.
[5738.17s -> 5740.71s]  You farming bat chests or actual sympathy here?
[5740.71s -> 5741.11s]  I don't know.
[5741.11s -> 5741.43s]  Guy.
[5742.97s -> 5745.53s]  No, stop saying that about Ludwig.
[5745.53s -> 5746.25s]  I love Ludwig.
[5746.25s -> 5747.13s]  I'm saying that.
[5749.00s -> 5750.12s]  I can't repeat that.
[5750.12s -> 5753.08s]  I didn't leak the code stuff.
[5753.08s -> 5761.10s]  I hecking love Ludwig.
[5764.41s -> 5765.61s]  I can hear the bat chest.
[5765.61s -> 5766.73s]  I don't even need to.
[5766.73s -> 5768.33s]  You don't gotta say it at that point.
[5768.33s -> 5774.81s]  Ludwig, can you do the gift Connor 500 subs challenge?
[5774.81s -> 5775.61s]  I don't.
[5775.61s -> 5777.13s]  It's like a trend.
[5777.13s -> 5778.57s]  I guess I don't know how it works.
[5778.57s -> 5779.21s]  Like a trend.
[5779.21s -> 5780.57s]  A lot of people are doing it.
[5780.57s -> 5783.42s]  Who are like some other people like just for influence?
[5783.42s -> 5788.15s]  Like Mr. Beast.
[5788.15s -> 5788.95s]  I did it.
[5788.95s -> 5790.17s]  You like Mr. B.
[5790.17s -> 5790.81s]  Jerma did it.
[5790.81s -> 5791.37s]  Jerma did it.
[5791.37s -> 5792.09s]  Mr. Beast did it.
[5792.09s -> 5793.21s]  And you talk Mr. Wait, wait, wait.
[5793.21s -> 5793.61s]  I'm sorry.
[5793.61s -> 5794.01s]  Let's not.
[5794.01s -> 5794.81s]  Psycho did it.
[5794.81s -> 5796.17s]  Psycho, but you did this.
[5796.17s -> 5796.89s]  I did it already.
[5796.89s -> 5797.77s]  You did it.
[5797.77s -> 5799.13s]  How does the challenge work?
[5799.13s -> 5803.46s]  You just give Connor 500 subs to Connerage fans.
[5803.46s -> 5805.38s]  That's it.
[5805.38s -> 5807.78s]  You can also like do like the gift Connor 5 subs challenge.
[5807.78s -> 5812.46s]  Like if you like don't have that much money, you just like be a part of something.
[5812.46s -> 5815.03s]  You know what?

[5817.56s -> 5821.62s]  Gift Connor 5.
[5821.62s -> 5824.26s]  I mean, if like it depends on like your yearly like net income though.
[5824.26s -> 5827.82s]  Like if you like you gave one sub.
[5827.82s -> 5829.02s]  Challenge accepted, Connor.
[5829.02s -> 5829.66s]  Did you see it?
[5829.66s -> 5831.02s]  One sub is not a challenge.
[5831.02s -> 5832.22s]  Five dollars.
[5832.22s -> 5837.64s]  Give Connor five dollars challenge.
[5837.64s -> 5839.32s]  Everybody's saying Ludwig's cringe.
[5839.32s -> 5839.64s]  Okay.
[5839.64s -> 5841.16s]  That doesn't feel nice after.
[5841.24s -> 5842.76s]  Usually you say, hey, thanks for the gift itself.
[5842.76s -> 5843.16s]  Ludwig.
[5843.16s -> 5843.96s]  I really appreciate it.
[5844.52s -> 5846.92s]  I owe my chat like 150 community subs.
[5846.92s -> 5849.80s]  I kept my all my cards, all my PayPal.
[5849.80s -> 5851.16s]  Everything gets declined from Twitch.
[5851.16s -> 5851.32s]  Now.
[5851.32s -> 5852.44s]  I don't know why.
[5852.44s -> 5853.00s]  Yeah, they get it.
[5853.00s -> 5854.04s]  It does happen to me a lot.
[5854.04s -> 5856.04s]  Grumpy Grim did the five sub challenge.
[5856.04s -> 5857.96s]  Well, Grumpy Grim is more money than you, Ludwig.
[5857.96s -> 5859.80s]  I had to get a new credit card just to do that.
[5859.80s -> 5861.26s]  Are you serious?
[5861.26s -> 5861.50s]  Yeah.
[5861.50s -> 5861.74s]  Yeah.
[5861.74s -> 5863.02s]  Because it kept getting declined.
[5863.02s -> 5868.65s]  And so I have like I got a there's a specific it's actually kind of insane,
[5868.65s -> 5873.13s]  but there's a specific bank that gives you a credit limit based off your followers.
[5873.13s -> 5874.49s]  Very dystopian.
[5875.64s -> 5876.36s]  Oh, yeah.
[5876.36s -> 5877.48s]  Very dystopian.
[5877.48s -> 5878.60s]  That's my bank.
[5878.60s -> 5880.28s]  It's a little bit give me the biggest.
[5880.28s -> 5886.87s]  Yeah, because I had a thousand dollar credit limit before them.
[5886.87s -> 5887.83s]  Wait, hold on.
[5887.83s -> 5896.06s]  Does that mean that you have like how much how many millions of followers do you have?
[5896.06s -> 5896.70s]  Wow.
[5896.70s -> 5902.58s]  Like, oh, like like one on Twitter.
[5902.58s -> 5904.66s]  You don't get it's not like a dollar a follower.
[5904.66s -> 5905.38s]  Oh, shit.
[5905.38s -> 5907.06s]  I was going to say what?
[5907.94s -> 5911.38s]  No, it's just the credit limit is based off those numbers.
[5911.38s -> 5912.66s]  They have some algorithm.
[5912.66s -> 5919.16s]  Oh, so they increase it if you have a more substantial of a following.
[5919.16s -> 5919.48s]  Really?
[5920.82s -> 5921.38s]  Yeah.
[5921.38s -> 5922.58s]  Yeah, they did that for me.
[5922.58s -> 5926.34s]  And like they gave me like a credit limit way over like anything that I'd ever need.
[5926.34s -> 5928.10s]  Like, it was just ridiculous.
[5928.10s -> 5929.94s]  And then I definitely don't get anywhere near that.
[5929.94s -> 5931.30s]  So now they text me like weekly.
[5931.30s -> 5933.22s]  They're like, you were bumping up your limit today.
[5933.22s -> 5934.02s]  Like, go for it.
[5934.02s -> 5934.74s]  Have at it.
[5934.74s -> 5935.70s]  Maybe have some fun.
[5935.70s -> 5938.04s]  And I would never do it.
[5938.04s -> 5939.72s]  What is your trail?
[5939.72s -> 5940.44s]  I'm going to stop streaming.
[5940.44s -> 5944.26s]  Maybe a little help, too.
[5944.26s -> 5946.02s]  This happened with Elden Ring, too.
[5946.02s -> 5948.58s]  I don't I don't know what's going on.
[5949.34s -> 5951.66s]  It's just steam games like are flickering.
[5952.22s -> 5952.46s]  Yeah.
[5952.46s -> 5953.66s]  No, that's an understatement.
[5953.66s -> 5955.50s]  Like it's a full strobe.
[5955.50s -> 5957.10s]  Like you can't see it on stream.
[5957.10s -> 5958.78s]  It's just on my monitor.
[5958.78s -> 5964.73s]  And is it just the game or like, could you play through OBS?
[5966.34s -> 5970.02s]  Like I could play through the OBS, but it's just the game.
[5970.02s -> 5972.42s]  I guess you can't play through OBS because you have to click on the game.
[5972.42s -> 5973.98s]  I didn't think about that.
[5973.98s -> 5974.62s]  Oh, true.
[5978.01s -> 5980.73s]  You guys like Elden Ring PVP stuff?
[5980.73s -> 5981.88s]  Oh, yeah.
[5981.88s -> 5982.92s]  You messaged me about that, Jeremy.
[5982.92s -> 5984.12s]  I still have to set that up.
[5984.12s -> 5986.44s]  Yeah, because I have confirmed.
[5986.44s -> 5989.16s]  I think it could work.
[5989.16s -> 5991.64s]  I think Elden Ring PVP always looks great.
[5991.64s -> 5995.53s]  You know who really wanted to do that actually was Saikuno.
[5995.53s -> 5996.68s]  Really?
[5996.68s -> 5999.16s]  You really wanted to do it because they did something somewhat similar to you.
[6000.46s -> 6000.94s]  Because I don't know.
[6000.94s -> 6002.14s]  Do you know the streamer me young?
[6002.94s -> 6008.14s]  Yeah, she played Elden Ring like you play Pokemon where she would throw out her
[6008.14s -> 6012.39s]  her Pokemon Saikuno and toast and they would fight the boss and she would run away.
[6012.39s -> 6015.43s]  Yeah, that's like exactly the kind of thing that I want to do.
[6015.91s -> 6020.31s]  I want to do a night where we get a bunch of streamers that pick champions from their
[6020.31s -> 6023.43s]  community and we throw them out.
[6023.43s -> 6029.05s]  They have to fight in a PVP setting and we get up to maybe three to five champions from
[6029.05s -> 6033.53s]  the community and we are essentially trialed by combating each other.
[6033.53s -> 6034.89s]  Yeah, I think that's a great idea.
[6034.89s -> 6035.85s]  I like that idea.
[6035.85s -> 6036.97s]  That's cool.
[6036.97s -> 6041.02s]  I think the only thing that's...
[6041.02s -> 6042.46s]  I guess, no, it should be easy enough.
[6042.46s -> 6045.50s]  I was going to say making sure you summon the right person,
[6045.50s -> 6047.34s]  but you can just read the name and confirm it.
[6047.34s -> 6048.54s]  You have to confirm it beforehand, right?
[6049.34s -> 6057.38s]  Where it gets weird is so you can summon two gold cooperators and one invader.
[6057.38s -> 6061.22s]  So if we had more than four or five streamers, it would...
[6061.22s -> 6066.50s]  There'd have to be multiple games going on because if only four people can be in a game,
[6067.30s -> 6071.69s]  the two people that are going against each other, so like two streamers,
[6071.69s -> 6077.59s]  one streamer would summon as a gold sign the other streamer and then summon that streamer's
[6078.15s -> 6083.59s]  person as another gold sign and then they would have to summon an invader that was on their team.
[6083.59s -> 6087.13s]  It's very, very confusing, but I think it would work.
[6087.13s -> 6092.79s]  Yeah, it sounds harder to do with many people.
[6092.79s -> 6094.63s]  Like if you had a group of eight doing it or something.
[6094.63s -> 6096.20s]  Yeah.
[6096.20s -> 6098.92s]  Because only two streamers could get their fighters in at once.
[6098.92s -> 6101.00s]  I feel like the setup will be the most...
[6101.00s -> 6102.04s]  Maybe it's possible.
[6102.04s -> 6103.32s]  Or one gold, two red.
[6104.04s -> 6112.62s]  The setup would be a little weird, but it would theoretically function correctly.
[6112.62s -> 6117.34s]  I've got at least two or three people in mind that I know would be great competitors.
[6117.34s -> 6118.70s]  You have like warriors already?
[6118.70s -> 6119.34s]  Oh, yeah.
[6119.34s -> 6123.13s]  I'll have to run my own event to get my own warriors.
[6123.13s -> 6126.97s]  Yeah, I was going to say whoever wanted to do it, you'd have to have at least,
[6126.97s -> 6132.18s]  you know, try to get whatever the number we decide, like three to five champions.
[6132.18s -> 6135.62s]  So they'd probably have to be people that...
[6135.62s -> 6137.43s]  Because I don't...
[6137.43s -> 6139.67s]  I don't know, what do you draw the line of,
[6139.67s -> 6143.59s]  oh, I'm going to get like an Elden Ring PvP guy to come in and just wipe the floor.
[6144.70s -> 6147.34s]  I think everyone should understand and keep it fun, you know?
[6147.34s -> 6147.82s]  Yeah.
[6147.82s -> 6150.87s]  A barf drinker absolutely is one of them.
[6150.87s -> 6151.67s]  I've got to try.
[6152.23s -> 6157.29s]  Honestly, after that stream ended, I was like, hey, do we know who that is?
[6157.29s -> 6163.45s]  Because I really want them on my team.
[6163.45s -> 6165.99s]  Connor, you think you can do this challenge?
[6165.99s -> 6169.75s]  Could you eat this in 90 minutes for $3,500?
[6169.75s -> 6170.79s]  Challenge destroyed.
[6172.25s -> 6173.37s]  What does that look like?
[6173.37s -> 6177.54s]  A couple large fries, four Big Macs, was that 20 nuggets?
[6177.54s -> 6178.82s]  40 nuggets, I think.
[6178.82s -> 6181.22s]  40 nuggets and four Cokes.
[6181.78s -> 6182.82s]  Yeah, three medium Cokes.
[6182.82s -> 6183.86s]  90 minutes?
[6183.86s -> 6184.98s]  Probably not, honestly.
[6184.98s -> 6186.02s]  I don't think I can do that.
[6186.02s -> 6189.86s]  Yeah, we're trying to track down the real barf drinker.
[6189.86s -> 6192.58s]  It's going to be like, all right, it's going to be hard.
[6192.58s -> 6196.10s]  Because now, now, like somebody just said,
[6196.10s -> 6203.05s]  a thousand of you just went to Ranalla and changed your name to barf drinker.
[6203.05s -> 6203.77s]  We'll figure it out.
[6203.77s -> 6205.53s]  If we do it, it's just a fun idea.
[6205.53s -> 6205.93s]  We'll see.
[6207.26s -> 6209.18s]  How I never spend near the limit.
[6209.18s -> 6211.66s]  My last text from them was the beginning of the year.
[6211.66s -> 6214.54s]  They said we're starting off the year with a challenge.
[6214.54s -> 6218.62s]  They said spend $5,000 by next weekend to unlock a surprise.
[6218.62s -> 6220.30s]  And I never responded.
[6220.30s -> 6222.36s]  Wait, so what is your credit limit with them?
[6222.36s -> 6224.06s]  What?
[6224.06s -> 6224.70s]  Say it again.
[6224.70s -> 6226.55s]  How high is your credit limit high with them?
[6226.55s -> 6227.91s]  Like much higher than the other stuff?
[6227.91s -> 6228.47s]  Yeah.
[6228.47s -> 6231.13s]  My credit limit, I have two credit cards.
[6231.13s -> 6234.95s]  For my credit card, it's $1,000.
[6234.95s -> 6238.07s]  And for this credit card, it's $100,000.
[6238.07s -> 6239.03s]  Give me one second.
[6239.03s -> 6239.67s]  I'll be right back.
[6239.67s -> 6241.67s]  Sarian, this is really tough.
[6241.67s -> 6242.47s]  You're getting big, man.
[6242.47s -> 6242.97s]  All right.
[6243.51s -> 6244.23s]  Give me one second.
[6244.23s -> 6245.13s]  Yeah.
[6245.13s -> 6249.90s]  Yeah, that's with the social follower credit limit bank.
[6249.90s -> 6252.15s]  I would be kind of scared of that in a way.
[6254.22s -> 6254.94s]  $100,000?
[6255.98s -> 6256.46s]  To fear.
[6257.02s -> 6261.18s]  If you need to purchase a $20,000 statue of Jackie Chan, perhaps.
[6261.18s -> 6261.82s]  That's true.
[6261.82s -> 6263.22s]  Just put it on the card.
[6263.22s -> 6268.76s]  That's crazy.
[6268.76s -> 6270.79s]  But I can only use it for business stuff.
[6270.79s -> 6277.85s]  I can't like take my card to Trader Joe's.
[6279.29s -> 6282.65s]  $100,000 credit limit at Trader Joe's.
[6282.65s -> 6287.05s]  Like, yeah, I guess I'll take every tiki masala you have in the store.
[6287.05s -> 6292.22s]  It's like a Mr. Beast title.
[6292.22s -> 6294.36s]  That is kind of like a Mr. Beast title.
[6294.36s -> 6296.44s]  How long do you think you could go without eating food, Jerma?
[6299.13s -> 6299.85s]  Until I die?
[6300.73s -> 6301.61s]  No, no, honest.
[6301.61s -> 6302.73s]  Like without dying.
[6302.73s -> 6305.37s]  Like right now, if it was like a challenge,
[6305.37s -> 6309.29s]  you had to go as long as you possibly could before you cracked.
[6309.29s -> 6310.41s]  How long do you think that would go?
[6314.20s -> 6315.62s]  Probably 24 hours.
[6315.62s -> 6317.70s]  And then you'd crack?
[6317.70s -> 6319.06s]  I'd crack after a day.
[6319.06s -> 6321.86s]  I'd crack it like probably 22 to 24 hours.
[6321.86s -> 6323.42s]  I think so.
[6323.42s -> 6327.02s]  Ludwig, I'm telling you, my hunger strikeathon is going to break the internet, man.
[6327.02s -> 6328.94s]  People are going to be tuning in from all over.
[6330.60s -> 6333.32s]  I need to get Connor a thousand subs so he eats.
[6333.32s -> 6334.44s]  And then like I do it.
[6334.44s -> 6336.68s]  I think it's a bad idea.
[6336.68s -> 6339.56s]  People would be like, this guy's got to eat food and they'd be subbing.
[6339.56s -> 6342.22s]  But don't you think people might say,
[6343.03s -> 6348.55s]  Connor, you are exploiting your viewers by threatening to go starve yourself to death.
[6348.55s -> 6349.59s]  That's why they're giving it.
[6350.31s -> 6350.87s]  It's not a threat.
[6350.87s -> 6351.51s]  It's going to happen.
[6351.51s -> 6352.47s]  It's a plot.
[6354.55s -> 6356.79s]  If I don't get the sub goal, I'm just not going to eat.
[6356.79s -> 6357.83s]  That's worse.
[6357.83s -> 6358.95s]  I would say that's worse.
[6358.95s -> 6361.51s]  I can't get his head stuck in the french fry box.
[6363.51s -> 6366.55s]  If I don't get these subs, I'm just not going to eat.
[6366.55s -> 6367.54s]  Wait, get off.
[6370.90s -> 6371.54s]  Okay, sorry.
[6371.54s -> 6373.54s]  Yeah, no, I'm not going to eat food unless I get the sub goal.
[6376.26s -> 6379.06s]  How many people are just going to go to that and just be like,
[6379.06s -> 6380.97s]  I'm just kind of out of here.
[6381.37s -> 6386.66s]  Well, the hope is that people would show up and be on the same team as me.
[6386.66s -> 6392.50s]  If they band together and don't pay, would you really not eat for days?
[6392.50s -> 6393.78s]  Hold on.
[6393.78s -> 6395.38s]  I don't need to just see bumper.
[6395.38s -> 6397.30s]  I could not go more than one day.
[6397.30s -> 6398.42s]  12 hours would be hard.
[6398.42s -> 6400.58s]  More than 24 hours would be impossible, I think.
[6401.38s -> 6402.82s]  This is a great picture bumper, by the way.
[6403.54s -> 6407.78s]  He was like jumping around the table trying to get this thing off.
[6408.50s -> 6410.04s]  Would you get into the french fries?
[6410.60s -> 6411.10s]  Yeah.
[6413.16s -> 6417.14s]  Jerm, I mention it because Mr. Beast called me today
[6417.14s -> 6420.26s]  and he wants to do a video where he doesn't eat for an extended period,
[6420.26s -> 6422.34s]  but like a month's worth of time.
[6422.34s -> 6424.52s]  A month in a row of not eating.
[6424.52s -> 6425.32s]  Yeah, yeah.
[6425.32s -> 6427.40s]  I think you die in seven days.
[6427.40s -> 6429.80s]  Like, don't you die in like four days?
[6430.52s -> 6432.36s]  I think I thought you could go like a month.
[6432.36s -> 6433.96s]  Yeah, I thought it was like three days for water.
[6435.80s -> 6436.68s]  30 for food.
[6436.68s -> 6437.24s]  That's water.
[6437.24s -> 6439.80s]  Okay, yeah, water is seven days.
[6439.80s -> 6443.24s]  But I think it's like also you probably need a bit of training for 30 days.
[6443.24s -> 6444.28s]  Like, I don't think you.
[6444.28s -> 6446.28s]  What about like vitamins or nutrients?
[6446.28s -> 6447.64s]  No, any nutrients at all?
[6447.64s -> 6450.70s]  Like, I imagine it's no calories,
[6450.70s -> 6454.04s]  but probably like, you know, a Flintstones gummy vitamin.
[6454.04s -> 6455.59s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[6455.59s -> 6456.79s]  I don't know if I would do that.
[6456.79s -> 6459.03s]  So if you guys want to find out how long it can go,
[6459.03s -> 6461.51s]  tune into the hunger strikeathon after like a month
[6461.51s -> 6465.11s]  when the sub goal gets to like 10k for like food and eating.
[6465.11s -> 6468.57s]  It's based on your body fat.
[6468.57s -> 6469.94s]  Oh, yeah.
[6469.94s -> 6471.22s]  Yeah, that's what Charlie was saying.
[6471.22s -> 6474.58s]  You probably feel awful after.
[6474.58s -> 6475.14s]  I don't know.
[6475.14s -> 6478.58s]  I can't even imagine doing that for more than even a couple of days.
[6478.58s -> 6478.98s]  I don't know.
[6478.98s -> 6480.34s]  I feel like they're terrible.
[6481.54s -> 6482.82s]  Yeah, he wanted to do it with people.
[6482.82s -> 6487.24s]  So he asked me, but I don't think I'd make it more than a week.
[6487.24s -> 6489.82s]  But I think like a week I could do.
[6489.82s -> 6493.42s]  What about like organ damage?
[6495.05s -> 6495.69s]  Oh, yeah.
[6495.69s -> 6496.49s]  No, that's part of it.
[6496.49s -> 6502.47s]  I think although my aunt did this where she didn't eat for.
[6502.47s -> 6503.75s]  I think it was like three days.
[6503.75s -> 6506.86s]  She fasted, which I don't think is that uncommon.
[6506.86s -> 6509.82s]  And and it's cool because it resets your palate.
[6509.82s -> 6511.26s]  And then you get a baby's palate.
[6511.26s -> 6516.62s]  She hated coffee and alcohol and smoking, even though she did all those before.
[6517.18s -> 6519.02s]  And she just liked what she did as a kid.
[6522.62s -> 6525.90s]  Like fasting is, you know, something people do.
[6525.90s -> 6533.08s]  But like a month straight of not eating anything full month.
[6533.08s -> 6540.87s]  Yeah, three to seven days, I think, isn't that rare in the fasting world, right?
[6540.87s -> 6541.27s]  I know.
[6541.27s -> 6543.19s]  I know absolutely nothing about fasting.
[6543.27s -> 6550.44s]  I just know that that you cannot survive more than like a month without food.
[6550.44s -> 6558.49s]  My mom used to do 48 hours every year or so.
[6558.49s -> 6562.04s]  What point does I don't even I'm trying to even think what would even happen
[6562.04s -> 6563.96s]  after like three weeks straight.
[6563.96s -> 6565.40s]  You'd have to have some form of nutrients.
[6565.40s -> 6565.80s]  You have to.
[6566.86s -> 6570.38s]  Yeah, I think you have to have like maybe you do.
[6570.38s -> 6570.94s]  You know what?
[6571.58s -> 6574.66s]  I don't know if it's those IV fluid drips.
[6574.66s -> 6579.50s]  We're just going to do like an IV bag every few days.
[6579.50s -> 6580.86s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6582.07s -> 6584.87s]  Like the ones influencers use after crazy parties.
[6584.87s -> 6586.07s]  At what point is it just sad?
[6586.07s -> 6588.66s]  You're just watching Mr. Beast like in pain.
[6588.66s -> 6590.74s]  He's like, oh, guys, I got the IV today.
[6592.47s -> 6596.23s]  I think I think what they keep it light by having Carl Jacobs come in
[6596.23s -> 6599.03s]  with a big old like McDonald's order.
[6599.03s -> 6601.13s]  Then he eats in front of him.
[6601.13s -> 6605.11s]  And then they go, oh, Carl, oh, Carl, thanks.
[6605.91s -> 6606.95s]  I don't know about all that.
[6606.95s -> 6609.35s]  I don't know if I would not be able to do that.
[6609.35s -> 6613.90s]  I was like, oh, even just like doing the IV bag for nutrients thing.
[6613.98s -> 6616.47s]  I kind of would rather just eat like a banana.
[6618.97s -> 6620.09s]  Well, yeah, obviously.
[6620.09s -> 6620.33s]  Yeah.
[6622.04s -> 6622.36s]  Oh, yeah.
[6622.36s -> 6623.16s]  Here we're going to do an IV.
[6623.16s -> 6625.88s]  We're going to do like just like a vitamin and nutrient IV.
[6625.88s -> 6628.44s]  I can I just have like a coconut water instead.
[6628.44s -> 6629.96s]  Like I think that's I would rather have that.
[6630.94s -> 6635.70s]  Can I just have food with nutrition?
[6635.70s -> 6637.46s]  Boys, I don't want to hold you up any longer.
[6637.46s -> 6638.50s]  You can just play without me.
[6638.50s -> 6639.70s]  I cannot fix this.
[6639.70s -> 6641.62s]  I've tried literally fucking everything.
[6641.62s -> 6644.23s]  It is just not not working.
[6644.23s -> 6645.19s]  Uh, all right.
[6645.19s -> 6648.55s]  You want to try restarting or you just want to call it?
[6648.55s -> 6651.35s]  Uh, I can try restart.
[6651.35s -> 6654.31s]  I don't see why that would fix it, but I can give it a try.
[6654.31s -> 6656.73s]  You'll turn it off and turn it on again.
[6656.73s -> 6657.61s]  We can chill for a little bit.
[6657.61s -> 6658.25s]  So it's all good.
[6658.25s -> 6658.73s]  Run it.
[6658.73s -> 6662.09s]  I linked you guys a type racer if you guys want to get a little crazy here.
[6662.82s -> 6664.18s]  Not very good at this.
[6664.18s -> 6668.06s]  Charlie, you could also just play through OBS for now.
[6668.06s -> 6670.33s]  Well, I'd still need to click into the game.
[6670.33s -> 6673.70s]  Oh, that's true.
[6673.70s -> 6676.87s]  Uh, we can try that.
[6676.87s -> 6678.63s]  I can try just playing through OBS.
[6678.63s -> 6684.23s]  Let me try one last thing with the refresh rate, even though I know that won't fix it.
[6684.23s -> 6685.59s]  The dude that just keeps spamming.
[6690.17s -> 6695.02s]  Guy in my chat says he he fasts two weeks every three months and you have to drink water,
[6695.02s -> 6699.50s]  take vitamins and have salt and it only works if you have stored fat.
[6699.50s -> 6704.46s]  I got enough medical problems, man.
[6704.46s -> 6708.14s]  I don't I don't think I'd want to like cause another one somehow.
[6708.14s -> 6710.82s]  Who am I in with?
[6710.82s -> 6711.46s]  Is this Connor?
[6711.46s -> 6711.94s]  It's me.
[6712.74s -> 6713.30s]  All right, Connor.
[6713.30s -> 6714.94s]  You quick?
[6714.94s -> 6715.34s]  Yeah.
[6715.34s -> 6716.14s]  Well, I don't know.
[6716.14s -> 6726.63s]  Actually, no, I'm not quick.
[6726.63s -> 6735.08s]  Yes, that's also I would also want to be careful of like we need doctors,
[6735.16s -> 6742.81s]  like medical staff kind of nutritionist be like kind of really, really advising that
[6742.81s -> 6752.89s]  like I would be scared to do that personally.
[6752.89s -> 6753.77s]  You need professionals.
[6755.67s -> 6757.67s]  No doctor would say to do that.
[6757.67s -> 6762.28s]  I love the background menu music.
[6762.28s -> 6763.00s]  Yeah.
[6763.00s -> 6768.68s]  Yeah, I've never I've never fasted or anything.
[6769.32s -> 6772.20s]  Well, okay, that's not necessarily true.
[6773.19s -> 6781.21s]  I have done a small fast because I was trying to see and by small, I mean like not even
[6781.21s -> 6786.23s]  a full day, like one day because back when I was having all the medical problems in like
[6786.23s -> 6791.67s]  my chest and back and shit, it was like I'm going to just eliminate literally everything
[6791.67s -> 6793.75s]  and just drink fucking water and see what happens.
[6794.63s -> 6801.46s]  And I started to slowly introduce foods and stuff to see if it was something I was eating,
[6801.46s -> 6802.82s]  something that was causing a problem like that.
[6802.82s -> 6803.06s]  Right.
[6804.12s -> 6806.84s]  But never I never did it for any other reason.
[6806.84s -> 6812.22s]  That was literally like not even 24 hours.
[6812.30s -> 6817.90s]  It was like to start an elimination diet, essentially to slowly put in foods and spices
[6817.90s -> 6819.50s]  and is it a food additive?
[6819.50s -> 6820.86s]  Is it like gluten?
[6820.86s -> 6822.46s]  I was trying to figure that out.
[6822.46s -> 6826.98s]  Ah, Gandhi.
[6826.98s -> 6827.62s]  All right.
[6827.62s -> 6828.82s]  I'm fucking back.
[6828.82s -> 6829.99s]  Good to go.
[6829.99s -> 6830.79s]  I'm ready.
[6830.79s -> 6831.83s]  Oh, put it up.
[6831.83s -> 6832.15s]  All right.
[6832.15s -> 6833.75s]  So this is America.
[6833.75s -> 6836.87s]  It's going to start out a little differently because we're going to be placing our troops.
[6837.83s -> 6843.02s]  So just try to make it pretty speedy here because this can take a long time if not.
[6843.02s -> 6844.94s]  But once it's your turn, you could just place one trip.
[6844.94s -> 6845.72s]  I'm ready.
[6846.20s -> 6846.76s]  Okay.
[6846.76s -> 6847.40s]  Okay.
[6847.40s -> 6850.92s]  So what's the card thing that's different?
[6850.92s -> 6851.96s]  It's progressive.
[6851.96s -> 6852.76s]  I don't know, Jeremy.
[6852.76s -> 6854.44s]  Do you know how you might be able to explain it better?
[6854.44s -> 6858.76s]  So if you turn your cards in, it's the first person to turn it in and gets the worst one
[6858.76s -> 6862.74s]  because it's only going to be like three troops.
[6862.74s -> 6864.18s]  Oh, so it always gets higher.
[6864.18s -> 6868.26s]  Every time somebody turns it in, it goes a little bit higher.
[6868.26s -> 6869.62s]  Uh, okay.
[6869.62s -> 6872.90s]  I will claim Ohio.
[6872.90s -> 6874.26s]  I'll take Florida.
[6874.26s -> 6876.71s]  Okay.
[6876.71s -> 6884.01s]  I was going to take Georgia, but if Charlie's going to take Florida, I'll take Texas.
[6884.01s -> 6887.22s]  Oh, it's fog of war.
[6887.22s -> 6887.94s]  So I can't see.
[6887.94s -> 6889.06s]  We shouldn't be saying this out loud.
[6889.06s -> 6889.86s]  I forgot about this.
[6889.86s -> 6891.94s]  Oh, you can't see.
[6891.94s -> 6894.34s]  That was the whole point of fog of war.
[6894.34s -> 6900.74s]  I'm just going to use this like a places that I always want to like have wanted to travel to.
[6900.74s -> 6901.62s]  That sounds fun.
[6901.62s -> 6903.05s]  So we placed 30.
[6903.05s -> 6905.38s]  So we have to do 30 of these turns, right?
[6905.38s -> 6905.70s]  Yes.
[6906.82s -> 6907.78s]  Are there only 30 states?
[6907.78s -> 6909.46s]  No, there should be all 50 here, no?
[6909.46s -> 6910.74s]  No, but we have 30 troops.
[6910.74s -> 6913.45s]  I think you're going to fortify after we pick enough.
[6913.45s -> 6913.85s]  Yeah.
[6913.85s -> 6914.41s]  Yeah.
[6914.41s -> 6916.89s]  So you don't stack them, I believe.
[6916.89s -> 6924.92s]  You always have to pick new territories.
[6924.92s -> 6927.00s]  Oh, has nobody clicked that?
[6927.00s -> 6935.35s]  That's weird.
[6936.47s -> 6940.15s]  I'm closing my eyes and just picking territories at random.
[6940.15s -> 6944.28s]  I'm insulted that they've like combined some states.
[6944.28s -> 6956.84s]  Oh, interesting.
[6956.84s -> 6959.24s]  I can't even see who got the territory.
[6959.24s -> 6961.38s]  Oh, it's a secret.
[6961.38s -> 6964.68s]  It is a secret.
[6964.68s -> 6966.28s]  Secret secrets are no fun.
[6966.28s -> 6972.62s]  New Hampshire's not too small.
[6972.62s -> 6973.74s]  It's an important state.
[6973.74s -> 6982.68s]  I have a plan.
[6982.68s -> 6983.32s]  Don't worry.
[6983.32s -> 6987.59s]  Will they know that this is a plan?
[6987.59s -> 6988.39s]  There is a plan.
[6988.39s -> 7015.05s]  Oh, quick turns.
[7015.05s -> 7015.69s]  Hi.
[7015.69s -> 7018.60s]  And how does this work?
[7018.60s -> 7022.20s]  Because I feel like there's no way that some of you have not clicked on this.
[7022.20s -> 7028.55s]  I have no idea.
[7028.55s -> 7029.75s]  I'm curious what you're referencing, yeah.
[7031.22s -> 7031.78s]  We'll see soon.
[7031.78s -> 7032.90s]  We'll see soon.
[7032.90s -> 7045.99s]  I feel like if there's a question mark when I clicked, then it's probably like someone took it, right?
[7045.99s -> 7046.55s]  Yeah.
[7046.55s -> 7049.58s]  I'm just shocked that this is shocking.
[7049.58s -> 7062.79s]  What version of the US map is this?
[7063.91s -> 7067.11s]  You should be able to see the black outlines, and those are the territories in this one.
[7069.80s -> 7074.36s]  Yeah, what's going on over here in this big hole?
[7076.28s -> 7079.16s]  I think it's just like the Rocky Mountains.
[7079.16s -> 7081.00s]  Is that just the mountains?
[7081.00s -> 7086.28s]  I think they did it so like Colorado wouldn't be in such a shit spot because it'd be connected
[7086.28s -> 7088.04s]  by like seven states or something.
[7088.04s -> 7088.68s]  Oh, okay.
[7089.64s -> 7092.52s]  They marked up like the whole spot where the Unabomber was hiding too.
[7094.87s -> 7095.59s]  Yeah, that too.
[7095.59s -> 7096.31s]  Don't go there.
[7118.71s -> 7119.43s]  That works for me.
[7120.07s -> 7123.06s]  I'm gonna have a shit state at the end.
[7123.70s -> 7141.40s]  All right, all right.
[7141.40s -> 7142.60s]  This is where I think we fortify.
[7143.74s -> 7145.18s]  It is fortify phase, yeah.
[7145.18s -> 7165.46s]  I feel like this is gonna be very, very hard for whoever decided to go in the middle.
[7170.34s -> 7171.30s]  No, why would that be?
[7173.43s -> 7175.59s]  You're surrounded at all times.
[7175.59s -> 7176.39s]  Is this me?
[7176.39s -> 7177.91s]  A very good spot, I think.
[7177.91s -> 7178.55s]  This is red.
[7180.22s -> 7181.82s]  You have 19 troops you have to place.
[7181.82s -> 7183.74s]  Is it making you do all of them at once?
[7183.74s -> 7186.86s]  Charlie, are you placing things or no?
[7186.86s -> 7188.06s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm placing them.
[7188.06s -> 7188.54s]  Okay, okay.
[7188.54s -> 7189.82s]  It's making you do all of them?
[7189.82s -> 7190.22s]  Yeah.
[7190.22s -> 7191.42s]  Oh, oh, we go in order.
[7192.54s -> 7192.86s]  Oh my god.
[7192.86s -> 7194.30s]  I think it's just you right now.
[7194.30s -> 7195.90s]  I think you have to do all of them.
[7195.90s -> 7196.22s]  Okay.
[7197.19s -> 7199.19s]  This is the presidential race.
[7201.48s -> 7202.28s]  Okay, there you go.
[7202.28s -> 7202.68s]  Sorry.
[7203.32s -> 7205.21s]  They can take everything that's not this.
[7207.56s -> 7210.12s]  Feels like he was saying the south there.
[7216.95s -> 7217.99s]  Electoral map.
[7218.79s -> 7219.99s]  We'll see who becomes president.
[7220.63s -> 7228.87s]  It's all Jeb.
[7229.59s -> 7232.65s]  I see.
[7232.65s -> 7240.68s]  Somebody said DOS died for this?
[7240.68s -> 7243.56s]  DOS did not die for this because after this we're playing DOS.
[7243.56s -> 7244.28s]  I'm doing it tonight.
[7246.14s -> 7263.14s]  All right, all right.
[7269.53s -> 7270.49s]  Oh my jeez.
[7273.69s -> 7275.53s]  He hates Europe.
[7275.53s -> 7279.69s]  Dude, in like two or three hours it's gonna be EU stream anyways.
[7279.69s -> 7291.29s]  Okay, all right.
[7291.29s -> 7293.37s]  Now we see a bit of the map here.
[7293.37s -> 7293.53s]  Why?
[7293.53s -> 7294.81s]  Why do we see so much of the map?
[7294.81s -> 7296.10s]  What do you mean?
[7296.74s -> 7297.38s]  It started.
[7297.38s -> 7300.22s]  How come some of these are fog of ward though?
[7300.22s -> 7302.22s]  You can only see adjacent areas.
[7302.22s -> 7303.98s]  Oh, okay, I get it, I get it.
[7304.54s -> 7305.02s]  Yeah.
[7305.02s -> 7309.54s]  Okay.
[7309.54s -> 7311.46s]  Whoa, whoa, chill man.
[7311.46s -> 7316.95s]  I mean it's very, it's obvious what I have to do here.
[7316.95s -> 7317.91s]  Let's chill out man.
[7317.91s -> 7319.03s]  Let's not go anywhere.
[7319.03s -> 7319.75s]  Jeremy, you're green?
[7320.31s -> 7321.83s]  Yeah, I don't think there are any alliances here.
[7321.83s -> 7323.03s]  I think this is the only one.
[7323.03s -> 7324.07s]  We got one per place.
[7324.95s -> 7325.43s]  Fresh game.
[7325.43s -> 7326.15s]  It's a brand new game.
[7326.15s -> 7327.11s]  This is a new day.
[7327.99s -> 7329.80s]  New day, new dawn, new battles.
[7332.34s -> 7332.74s]  Who's right?
[7332.74s -> 7334.42s]  Oh, you're gonna regret that.
[7336.44s -> 7339.48s]  I like listening because I can't see anything.
[7340.36s -> 7343.69s]  It was actually way worse as a stream experience but funnier.
[7343.69s -> 7345.45s]  Oh, you guys can't see anything?
[7348.65s -> 7350.97s]  I have not seen a thing happen.
[7350.97s -> 7356.50s]  I was adjacent to it so I could see it.
[7356.50s -> 7357.14s]  Don't do it.
[7360.95s -> 7361.45s]  Okay.
[7362.09s -> 7365.54s]  A little fortification happening.
[7365.54s -> 7366.42s]  I love that.
[7366.42s -> 7366.82s]  There is.
[7368.30s -> 7369.74s]  Charlie, I've sent you an alliance.
[7369.74s -> 7370.22s]  Have you seen it?
[7370.86s -> 7371.50s]  Oh, I see it.
[7371.50s -> 7372.38s]  Yes, yes, yes.
[7372.38s -> 7372.94s]  Oh, all right.
[7372.94s -> 7374.46s]  Well, hey, Gascan.
[7376.14s -> 7379.26s]  Alliances, but it's just one country.
[7383.56s -> 7386.84s]  When I'm allied, I get to see all the new map.
[7386.84s -> 7388.36s]  Oh, shit.
[7388.36s -> 7388.84s]  Let's go.
[7389.64s -> 7392.12s]  Yeah, Gascan, you're gonna want to be my friend here, man.
[7392.12s -> 7392.92s]  You want to see the map.
[7394.25s -> 7396.73s]  That's actually pretty advantageous.
[7396.73s -> 7399.02s]  Did you just take Boston?
[7399.02s -> 7399.58s]  No.
[7399.58s -> 7401.82s]  That's fucking bullshit, dude.
[7401.82s -> 7402.22s]  All right, kid.
[7402.22s -> 7403.42s]  Listen, that's fucking stupid.
[7404.86s -> 7406.15s]  All right, fucking listen, kid.
[7406.95s -> 7409.11s]  I'll see you outside any donkeys anytime.
[7409.11s -> 7409.91s]  Oh, shut the fuck up.
[7409.91s -> 7411.59s]  You bring a pack of cigarettes and I'll fucking see you there.
[7412.23s -> 7417.14s]  You're frightening it away.
[7417.78s -> 7420.17s]  Oh, good expansion.
[7420.17s -> 7421.29s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[7429.42s -> 7432.76s]  I kind of feel like I can just go here.
[7438.58s -> 7439.38s]  Mm hmm.
[7441.27s -> 7456.89s]  By the way, if you see the X-Men, the graph bar on the left,
[7456.89s -> 7458.09s]  they're toggles.
[7458.09s -> 7458.73s]  Whoa.
[7458.73s -> 7460.25s]  And you can click them for more info,
[7461.90s -> 7464.30s]  like how many points every section gets you.
[7464.30s -> 7464.94s]  Oh, okay.
[7465.74s -> 7467.42s]  Like New England only gets you one point here.
[7467.42s -> 7468.22s]  It's kind of shit.
[7468.22s -> 7469.91s]  But the best one's the Heartland.
[7473.42s -> 7475.00s]  Oh, how is it?
[7475.00s -> 7477.48s]  Why is Nevada in the Rocky Mountains?
[7477.48s -> 7478.44s]  Oh, chill, guys.
[7481.50s -> 7483.50s]  No, it has mountains.
[7483.50s -> 7484.46s]  Is it in the real world?
[7484.46s -> 7485.34s]  What is it in the real world?
[7486.06s -> 7488.30s]  It's Southwest, considered, right?
[7489.02s -> 7492.28s]  I guess it is, right?
[7492.28s -> 7493.32s]  You know, like near Arizona.
[7495.78s -> 7497.38s]  We have an alliance, right, Lud?
[7497.38s -> 7500.26s]  Oh, it's one of the strongest alliances that have ever been formed.
[7500.26s -> 7502.10s]  Okay, then yeah, I'm gonna.
[7502.10s -> 7502.98s]  I haven't broken it off.
[7502.98s -> 7504.10s]  I have no dreams of it.
[7504.10s -> 7504.60s]  All right.
[7506.10s -> 7514.10s]  All right, so yeah, I would say we should really take the Heartland here.
[7514.10s -> 7515.06s]  Yeah, that's a good call.
[7522.18s -> 7524.90s]  You've just made a powerful enemy with Nebraska.
[7526.68s -> 7527.72s]  No, they're chill.
[7527.72s -> 7528.44s]  They like us.
[7528.44s -> 7529.16s]  We're like boys.
[7529.16s -> 7531.88s]  We were one of the finest governments they ever elected.
[7531.88s -> 7533.96s]  Actually, our office was very well liked.
[7542.20s -> 7545.90s]  Jeremy, I'm gonna let you go across Oklahoma and Arkansas, I think.
[7546.78s -> 7551.82s]  I think the plan is you should probably take that.
[7551.82s -> 7554.06s]  And, you know, let's take it to DMC.
[7554.06s -> 7557.43s]  How did you just steamroll Louisiana like that?
[7557.43s -> 7560.47s]  It was four to five and you only lost one troop.
[7560.47s -> 7561.83s]  That's the power of Texas.
[7561.83s -> 7562.63s]  What the fuck?
[7563.35s -> 7566.36s]  You only did only lose one that was fucked up.
[7579.98s -> 7581.66s]  It's a really interesting election map.
[7584.60s -> 7585.80s]  It was a weird year.
[7585.80s -> 7587.48s]  This is an interesting presidential year.
[7595.38s -> 7597.06s]  Just let me keep the Heartland.
[7597.06s -> 7600.57s]  Yeah, this is big.
[7601.77s -> 7602.73s]  This is either God.
[7604.18s -> 7606.34s]  This is a very bad move or it's a very good move.
[7606.34s -> 7609.46s]  It depends on how the how Arkansas does here.
[7609.46s -> 7611.38s]  Whoa, it looks like we're just rolling over.
[7614.46s -> 7616.06s]  Jesus Christ.
[7616.06s -> 7616.94s]  That was decent.
[7616.94s -> 7617.34s]  You went even.
[7617.34s -> 7618.22s]  That was pretty good.
[7618.22s -> 7623.74s]  Yeah, I wouldn't encroach on my territory here, Jerma.
[7623.74s -> 7632.82s]  Um, yeah, that's probably gonna do.
[7632.82s -> 7634.34s]  There's just a king in the Midwest.
[7634.34s -> 7634.90s]  What the heck?
[7634.90s -> 7637.30s]  Yeah, it's established that.
[7638.18s -> 7640.28s]  How did you get 15?
[7640.28s -> 7640.52s]  What?
[7641.56s -> 7643.40s]  I have three territories.
[7644.36s -> 7645.24s]  That's cringe.
[7645.24s -> 7646.44s]  That's everything that's cringe.
[7648.73s -> 7650.01s]  You're still on that?
[7650.01s -> 7650.33s]  Yep.
[7650.33s -> 7654.25s]  They're all like getting that immediately when you said that you have that much territory.
[7659.74s -> 7661.38s]  Cringe.
[7661.38s -> 7661.62s]  All right.
[7661.62s -> 7662.42s]  This is good for me.
[7662.42s -> 7663.06s]  I need to win this.
[7664.98s -> 7665.70s]  Oh, fuck.
[7665.70s -> 7666.87s]  Yeah.
[7666.87s -> 7667.83s]  All right.
[7667.83s -> 7675.19s]  That's all I want to do here actually.
[7675.19s -> 7675.51s]  Shit.
[7676.07s -> 7678.52s]  Just like keep Arkansas fortified.
[7678.52s -> 7681.53s]  I think like they've been through a lot.
[7681.53s -> 7689.29s]  I think it would be fruits me to kill Oklahoma.
[7690.62s -> 7693.02s]  You can probably take this whole region here.
[7693.02s -> 7695.58s]  Oh, I'm not trying to spread too thin though.
[7695.58s -> 7698.14s]  Whoa, don't do it a lot of way.
[7698.14s -> 7700.54s]  I leave the south for you, Charlie.
[7700.54s -> 7700.94s]  Okay.
[7700.94s -> 7702.06s]  Yeah, I'll come through the south.
[7706.58s -> 7707.86s]  I'm just Union Jack here.
[7707.86s -> 7709.46s]  I don't believe in manifest destiny.
[7710.26s -> 7710.90s]  Oh, okay.
[7714.68s -> 7715.56s]  All right.
[7715.56s -> 7719.45s]  I'm coming down with it.
[7720.25s -> 7726.44s]  Won't be two.
[7726.44s -> 7727.00s]  You win this.
[7729.96s -> 7730.92s]  I think you just fortify.
[7730.92s -> 7731.64s]  I don't think you.
[7731.64s -> 7732.52s]  I don't know.
[7732.52s -> 7735.48s]  Louisiana, they get wild down there.
[7735.48s -> 7736.20s]  Get wild.
[7736.20s -> 7736.76s]  Get wild.
[7736.76s -> 7737.88s]  They get a little wacky.
[7737.88s -> 7738.28s]  I might.
[7738.84s -> 7739.64s]  I might.
[7739.64s -> 7741.90s]  Do your special move and purchase.
[7741.90s -> 7742.46s]  Go team.
[7744.10s -> 7745.94s]  No, Texas is a little too scary.
[7745.94s -> 7747.46s]  How do I call off an attack?
[7747.46s -> 7749.22s]  I had a zero percent chance of winning.
[7749.22s -> 7750.98s]  So zero.
[7750.98s -> 7752.42s]  Yeah, it was actually zero.
[7752.42s -> 7753.54s]  It was 2v2 though, right?
[7753.54s -> 7754.10s]  Wouldn't know.
[7754.10s -> 7754.98s]  It was 1v2.
[7754.98s -> 7757.38s]  I said everybody wants to be your fucking enemy.
[7757.38s -> 7758.42s]  Nasty with it.
[7758.42s -> 7759.06s]  Oh, the misery.
[7759.06s -> 7760.26s]  Texas, they don't forget.
[7763.32s -> 7764.12s]  Oh, wow.
[7764.12s -> 7765.40s]  I didn't realize.
[7765.40s -> 7771.13s]  Is that Alabama on the left, right?
[7771.13s -> 7773.05s]  You can only be attacked from Louisiana.
[7773.05s -> 7774.09s]  That's actually pretty good for you.
[7774.65s -> 7776.76s]  Oh, yeah.
[7776.76s -> 7777.48s]  Yeah, you actually can.
[7779.32s -> 7781.26s]  I don't really know what I do here.
[7785.66s -> 7787.58s]  Hey, I'll cede to you the Midwest.
[7788.14s -> 7789.62s]  Or I guess not the Midwest.
[7789.62s -> 7790.66s]  The heartland, I should say.
[7791.46s -> 7792.82s]  Yeah, I'd like to keep the heartland.
[7793.46s -> 7795.19s]  I'm just kind of happy there.
[7795.75s -> 7800.52s]  So you can send those six around to wrangle up.
[7800.52s -> 7807.48s]  I freely cede both Nebraska and Arkansas.
[7807.48s -> 7808.68s]  We appreciate that a lot.
[7809.48s -> 7811.98s]  What state is this, Chad?
[7813.02s -> 7815.51s]  Is this even a real state?
[7815.51s -> 7817.35s]  This gets weird though, real quick,
[7817.35s -> 7821.75s]  because Connor, I have to go through you to attack anybody.
[7822.23s -> 7824.23s]  Well, you can go through Oklahoma and Arkansas.
[7824.23s -> 7826.87s]  I can, but if you claim that, then you get.
[7826.87s -> 7827.75s]  No, I don't want it, though.
[7830.07s -> 7835.83s]  No, I don't get anybody because I need New Mexico and Arizona, too.
[7835.83s -> 7838.87s]  Well, then let me try to surround you from the left and bottom.
[7838.87s -> 7840.71s]  So then they can only come at you from one side.
[7843.50s -> 7847.59s]  Yeah, I gave you Oklahoma and Arkansas last time.
[7847.59s -> 7848.23s]  I didn't care for this.
[7848.23s -> 7849.43s]  It's a little concerning down here.
[7849.43s -> 7849.83s]  That's all.
[7850.90s -> 7851.62s]  Yeah, I got you.
[7854.92s -> 7856.28s]  I'm going to end my attack here, I think.
[7857.00s -> 7860.02s]  Everybody's in good spirits.
[7860.02s -> 7864.28s]  I got to move troops down here.
[7871.48s -> 7878.49s]  Everybody's pals, the unions together.
[7878.49s -> 7882.78s]  All right, I got to come through here.
[7883.42s -> 7890.46s]  It's all right.
[7890.46s -> 7900.34s]  Hi, bumper.
[7900.34s -> 7902.30s]  I'm just trying to figure out what the...
[7902.30s -> 7906.41s]  This is going to get ugly.
[7906.41s -> 7908.17s]  This is actually really ugly already.
[7911.19s -> 7912.07s]  Scary situation.
[7912.79s -> 7914.94s]  We're just in a tough spot.
[7914.94s -> 7917.00s]  We don't have any of the east.
[7918.41s -> 7920.09s]  Oof, oof, big reinforcements there.
[7923.42s -> 7924.46s]  Oh my God.
[7926.28s -> 7928.60s]  Yeah, Ludwig was cheating.
[7928.60s -> 7930.92s]  Okay, let's do this.
[7931.56s -> 7932.92s]  Actually, no, let's do...
[7932.92s -> 7933.48s]  You know what?
[7935.62s -> 7937.13s]  You know what?
[7937.13s -> 7939.45s]  I think I do like Arkansas.
[7939.45s -> 7941.69s]  Let's do an even fight.
[7941.69s -> 7946.28s]  Ludwig, you should give up a whole territory to make it interesting.
[7946.28s -> 7948.20s]  Let's do an even fight here, Jerma.
[7948.20s -> 7948.92s]  Okay.
[7948.92s -> 7950.04s]  You're coming into a...
[7951.72s -> 7953.96s]  Oh, Jesus.
[7953.96s -> 7955.48s]  Big, very big.
[7957.74s -> 7966.10s]  Just because I'm bitter, I've taken Minnesota.
[7966.10s -> 7966.58s]  What the fuck?
[7966.58s -> 7967.30s]  What did I do?
[7967.78s -> 7969.22s]  I'm bitter.
[7969.22s -> 7969.78s]  What did I do?
[7970.34s -> 7971.22s]  It was bitterness.
[7972.02s -> 7972.98s]  What were you bitter about?
[7973.70s -> 7975.30s]  Losing against Jerma.
[7976.79s -> 7977.75s]  I'm not Jerma.
[7977.75s -> 7979.51s]  It's like pick on someone your own size.
[7979.51s -> 7982.55s]  Because I lost to Jerma, so I was like, okay, I need a win now.
[7986.60s -> 7987.88s]  I was going to try to fight him again.
[7987.88s -> 7989.00s]  I'm really scared of...
[7989.72s -> 7992.62s]  Charlie, you're just steam rolling through the whole south here.
[7993.50s -> 7997.34s]  Yeah, I didn't get any good cards.
[7997.34s -> 7999.26s]  I like when he says, yeah, as he adds troops.
[8003.58s -> 8004.86s]  I'm coming through Texas.
[8004.86s -> 8006.94s]  These guys fucked me in the ass earlier.
[8006.94s -> 8008.14s]  I want revenge.
[8008.14s -> 8009.34s]  They'll hold us strong.
[8009.34s -> 8009.90s]  Oh, baby.
[8009.90s -> 8011.10s]  They didn't at all.
[8011.10s -> 8013.72s]  They folded.
[8013.72s -> 8014.60s]  All right.
[8014.60s -> 8015.74s]  This is bad.
[8016.46s -> 8018.76s]  We're in a tough spot.
[8018.76s -> 8019.40s]  Yeah, we are.
[8020.12s -> 8024.28s]  It might be in our best interest to not work with each other
[8024.28s -> 8026.60s]  and instead get different allies and break them up.
[8026.60s -> 8029.64s]  You might have to turn around and get rid of me for my cards.
[8029.64s -> 8031.45s]  Depends on what he does here.
[8032.49s -> 8034.01s]  Okay, I think...
[8034.01s -> 8036.41s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[8036.41s -> 8039.21s]  Hey, Charlie or Ludwig, any of you guys want to be my pal
[8039.21s -> 8040.65s]  instead of like one or the other?
[8040.65s -> 8042.17s]  If you get Arizona, you get the whole territory.
[8042.17s -> 8044.25s]  Yeah, yeah, I think I'm going to have to do that.
[8044.25s -> 8045.53s]  Let's play it safe.
[8045.53s -> 8048.28s]  I'm going to grab that.
[8048.28s -> 8049.30s]  Shit.
[8049.30s -> 8053.72s]  Oh, a lot of ones on the west coast, huh?
[8053.72s -> 8056.90s]  Thankfully, it's so kind of isolated
[8056.90s -> 8060.34s]  that you have to go through everybody to get over here.
[8060.34s -> 8063.32s]  Yeah, you do have to stretch then.
[8068.66s -> 8073.34s]  Uh-oh, what's my play here?
[8073.34s -> 8073.90s]  All right.
[8074.54s -> 8075.90s]  I don't know.
[8076.70s -> 8079.42s]  The heartland is just not much of a heartland at this point.
[8080.87s -> 8084.95s]  What does he got up in Michigan and this area?
[8084.95s -> 8086.31s]  Minnesota is three.
[8086.31s -> 8087.19s]  It looks like...
[8087.19s -> 8088.63s]  I can't even see Michigan.
[8088.63s -> 8090.63s]  Illinois has got 11 right there.
[8090.63s -> 8092.97s]  I think it's Illinois.
[8092.97s -> 8093.29s]  Can you...
[8093.29s -> 8093.93s]  Yeah, it's Illinois.
[8093.93s -> 8094.97s]  Oh, you're not...
[8094.97s -> 8095.85s]  There's no border there.
[8095.85s -> 8096.49s]  You can't go...
[8096.49s -> 8097.29s]  You'd have to go up.
[8098.33s -> 8100.09s]  You got to go through Minnesota.
[8100.09s -> 8102.95s]  He's probably got nothing in this area.
[8103.59s -> 8106.95s]  This whole area up here with Indiana, no way.
[8106.95s -> 8109.11s]  He's got nine in Wisconsin, actually.
[8109.11s -> 8109.91s]  Oh, my God.
[8110.79s -> 8111.83s]  Oh, that's bad.
[8111.99s -> 8114.55s]  Just like, you know, it's not really cool.
[8114.55s -> 8117.13s]  It's because we're big Rogers fans over here.
[8117.13s -> 8121.72s]  I thought you were doing a thing where you knew we couldn't see.
[8121.72s -> 8122.52s]  So you just...
[8122.52s -> 8123.16s]  Oh, look, here's...
[8123.16s -> 8124.04s]  I got 11 troops.
[8124.04s -> 8125.08s]  I got 20 troops right here.
[8125.08s -> 8126.76s]  And then you got all ones.
[8126.76s -> 8129.40s]  I think what's better is you can't see and then you go in
[8129.40s -> 8131.08s]  and there's a shit ton of troops.
[8131.80s -> 8133.16s]  And you want to like alliance?
[8134.90s -> 8136.98s]  Just leave me the heartland, you know?
[8136.98s -> 8139.14s]  It sounds like it's just an alliance.
[8139.14s -> 8142.52s]  Then it'd just be stomping out Germa.
[8142.52s -> 8144.44s]  Well, I think Germa's all right.
[8144.44s -> 8147.24s]  Honestly, you guys can make whatever alliances you want,
[8147.24s -> 8149.80s]  but keep in mind, you're going to have to attack each other
[8149.80s -> 8150.60s]  to get over here.
[8150.60s -> 8154.63s]  So you're going to have to figure that out.
[8154.63s -> 8157.19s]  I think Charlie goes by south and I go by north.
[8157.19s -> 8158.39s]  Yeah, that might be the play.
[8160.89s -> 8162.65s]  The cards are about to become a big factor.
[8162.65s -> 8163.37s]  Maybe, like, don't.
[8163.37s -> 8164.65s]  Especially because they're progressive.
[8164.65s -> 8167.59s]  Maybe, like, don't do that.
[8167.59s -> 8169.19s]  Okay, Germa, I think I'm just going to have to
[8169.19s -> 8171.46s]  step into your territory a little bit.
[8171.46s -> 8172.79s]  Excuse me?
[8172.79s -> 8175.56s]  I think I'm going to have to step into your territory a little bit.
[8175.56s -> 8176.84s]  I'm a little scared.
[8176.84s -> 8179.48s]  I kind of want to, like, spread out a little bit.
[8180.81s -> 8183.53s]  Connor, what do you think about the Rocky Mountains?
[8183.53s -> 8185.45s]  You've always been, like, a Rocky Mountain guy to me.
[8185.45s -> 8189.56s]  I've never been there, but I do get that vibe, yeah.
[8189.56s -> 8190.52s]  You're there now.
[8190.52s -> 8191.64s]  Is it nice?
[8191.64s -> 8193.34s]  A lot of people have said that about me.
[8193.34s -> 8196.62s]  Lud, would you give me Arkansas over there
[8196.62s -> 8201.74s]  if I helped you collapse in on, like, the Nebraska, Minnesota area?
[8201.74s -> 8202.86s]  I'll do you one better.
[8202.86s -> 8204.14s]  I'll move out of Arkansas.
[8204.14s -> 8205.02s]  Oh, that's even better.
[8205.02s -> 8207.02s]  Fuck yeah.
[8207.02s -> 8208.70s]  Guys, you got to leave me alone.
[8208.70s -> 8214.36s]  Hey, well, Germa, I still consider this alliance on.
[8214.36s -> 8216.33s]  Like, I just needed to move.
[8216.33s -> 8217.85s]  Yeah, that's true.
[8217.85s -> 8218.58s]  It's true.
[8220.36s -> 8221.16s]  I'm just scared.
[8221.16s -> 8222.52s]  I'll see what I can do down here.
[8222.52s -> 8226.71s]  Let's go.
[8226.71s -> 8228.23s]  Oh, Jesus.
[8228.23s -> 8229.59s]  Germa, no, don't do this.
[8230.23s -> 8231.11s]  What the fuck?
[8231.11s -> 8233.67s]  Why do none of my troops fight?
[8233.67s -> 8234.17s]  Fuck.
[8234.55s -> 8235.43s]  Thank God.
[8235.43s -> 8237.27s]  Finally, someone with some balls here.
[8237.27s -> 8238.31s]  Thanks, New Mexico.
[8238.31s -> 8240.23s]  That second push was bold.
[8240.23s -> 8243.72s]  They didn't do anything.
[8243.72s -> 8246.28s]  I mean, Charlie and I are not prosperous for a civil war.
[8246.28s -> 8248.04s]  We're very allied right now.
[8248.04s -> 8249.24s]  Yeah, no, this is tight.
[8250.20s -> 8254.60s]  Germa, you could accept the request ticket if you want to see where this thing's off.
[8254.60s -> 8256.20s]  Right.
[8256.20s -> 8257.24s]  It's back on.
[8257.24s -> 8257.96s]  We're friends.
[8257.96s -> 8261.64s]  We're friends again.
[8261.64s -> 8262.66s]  Canter.
[8262.66s -> 8265.30s]  You're beginning 15 every round.
[8265.30s -> 8267.98s]  This is over.
[8267.98s -> 8272.30s]  Honestly, we should all just collaborate to get rid of Ludwig because he's got 50 troops.
[8272.30s -> 8274.54s]  Charlie, Charlie, consider it.
[8274.54s -> 8276.14s]  Charlie, I think you should actually consider it.
[8276.14s -> 8280.49s]  Ludwig is literally stomping everybody because he's three territories.
[8280.49s -> 8281.21s]  Yeah, that's true.
[8281.21s -> 8283.29s]  But I can't survive on my own.
[8283.29s -> 8284.17s]  I have to suckle his bosom.
[8284.17s -> 8285.69s]  This is what happened last game, though.
[8285.69s -> 8289.29s]  And then, like, you can survive, though, because we'll be on your side.
[8289.29s -> 8290.60s]  I don't know.
[8290.60s -> 8291.56s]  He's scary.
[8291.56s -> 8294.20s]  This guy is very strong part of the country.
[8294.20s -> 8295.80s]  Charlie, you wouldn't betray me, right?
[8295.80s -> 8296.44s]  No, I wouldn't.
[8296.44s -> 8298.26s]  I couldn't.
[8298.26s -> 8304.90s]  What happens when it's just down to you two and he's got 50 troops on the board and you've got Texas?
[8304.90s -> 8306.02s]  Cringe.
[8306.02s -> 8306.90s]  He's going to come for you.
[8306.90s -> 8307.70s]  He's going to end it.
[8308.66s -> 8310.98s]  Now he has the heartland, too, which is worth plus five.
[8310.98s -> 8313.02s]  This is bad.
[8313.02s -> 8317.10s]  Then it's just all a matter of, you know, we did our best down here in the south.
[8317.10s -> 8329.19s]  At least I still have, wow, I have Wyoming and Montana.
[8329.19s -> 8334.34s]  You sounded so excited about that.
[8334.90s -> 8341.42s]  I think that's like the smallest segment of the population.
[8341.42s -> 8343.98s]  I have like eight guys, like eight people.
[8343.98s -> 8347.99s]  You just reacted the same way as if you had found in the fridge you're really hungry
[8347.99s -> 8351.03s]  and it's like taco leftovers from six days ago.
[8351.67s -> 8352.79s]  That's all that I have left.
[8352.79s -> 8356.47s]  And it's just like, yeah, I like got those tacos that I didn't eat.
[8357.19s -> 8359.35s]  I got to be excited about something in the world.
[8359.35s -> 8367.13s]  All right.
[8367.13s -> 8367.45s]  All right.
[8367.45s -> 8368.09s]  We're doing great.
[8368.09s -> 8368.81s]  We're doing great.
[8370.10s -> 8371.83s]  I have three.
[8371.83s -> 8375.03s]  You can live another day if you just go east.
[8375.03s -> 8375.75s]  I was living.
[8376.92s -> 8380.70s]  My hope was right that I was going to get three cards and I just turned them in.
[8380.70s -> 8382.14s]  But the problem is none of my cards match.
[8382.14s -> 8386.73s]  So now I have three cards and three soldiers.
[8386.73s -> 8392.44s]  So you have the card turning was three.
[8392.44s -> 8395.22s]  I don't have anything to use.
[8397.75s -> 8399.90s]  But there we go.
[8399.90s -> 8400.14s]  Sure.
[8400.14s -> 8401.42s]  Let me just take Kansas back.
[8404.81s -> 8407.16s]  Let's take that.
[8410.54s -> 8412.22s]  March across the nevermind.
[8412.22s -> 8415.34s]  I used to like I used to like Ludwig.
[8415.34s -> 8418.01s]  But for some reason, this game makes me hate him.
[8418.01s -> 8418.65s]  The burning.
[8418.65s -> 8420.17s]  Yes, I agree.
[8420.17s -> 8421.61s]  You're reading a chat message.
[8421.61s -> 8422.65s]  You just got a new hater.
[8422.65s -> 8425.13s]  Apparently from a lot of people been signing up.
[8425.13s -> 8427.93s]  Hey, wait, is this a chat message or are you saying that's chat message?
[8427.93s -> 8429.13s]  That is a chat message.
[8429.13s -> 8430.33s]  Somebody's very upset about this.
[8431.53s -> 8433.53s]  Hey, they're up in arms all over.
[8433.53s -> 8434.09s]  Actually.
[8434.09s -> 8434.33s]  All right.
[8434.33s -> 8438.57s]  I feel like I just made good alliances in great war tactics.
[8438.57s -> 8439.85s]  So they used to like Ludwig.
[8439.85s -> 8441.05s]  Now I only like a truck.
[8441.05s -> 8441.29s]  Yeah.
[8441.29s -> 8442.17s]  Now I feel that moon.
[8449.16s -> 8450.44s]  Honestly, we've got to do something.
[8450.44s -> 8451.16s]  We've got to do something.
[8451.16s -> 8451.32s]  Yeah.
[8451.32s -> 8452.36s]  We got to make a big move.
[8452.36s -> 8453.16s]  We've got to make a move.
[8453.16s -> 8453.72s]  We have to.
[8456.73s -> 8457.53s]  That's all right.
[8457.53s -> 8458.01s]  It's good.
[8458.01s -> 8459.13s]  I'm just trying to break him up.
[8459.13s -> 8459.69s]  That's it.
[8459.69s -> 8460.49s]  That's all I'm trying to do.
[8460.49s -> 8460.73s]  Yeah.
[8461.29s -> 8463.98s]  I might as well miss soda.
[8463.98s -> 8464.70s]  Maybe that's just one.
[8464.70s -> 8466.17s]  Right.
[8466.17s -> 8466.89s]  Don't fight that.
[8470.33s -> 8471.29s]  Holy shit.
[8471.29s -> 8472.65s]  Everybody has to go after Ludwig.
[8472.65s -> 8473.93s]  Otherwise, it's over for everybody.
[8473.93s -> 8475.37s]  Carly, you got to switch up.
[8476.33s -> 8478.33s]  I see what's on his board, by the way.
[8478.33s -> 8480.09s]  If I did try, I couldn't win.
[8481.05s -> 8482.17s]  No one can win anyways.
[8483.13s -> 8484.57s]  I'm playing for second boys.
[8487.27s -> 8490.95s]  I have a mast of an army on Massachusetts.
[8490.95s -> 8491.59s]  Yeah.
[8491.59s -> 8493.27s]  He put the troops in deep.
[8493.99s -> 8497.43s]  If I see one teabag, they're losing their shit.
[8497.43s -> 8502.79s]  If you go for whatever state that is, Kansas and Colorado,
[8502.79s -> 8504.15s]  we're going to burn all the farmland.
[8504.15s -> 8505.75s]  You're going to get like nothing out of it.
[8505.75s -> 8508.10s]  You're going to burn the crops.
[8508.10s -> 8509.06s]  Everything's gone.
[8509.06s -> 8511.38s]  It's going to be unusable.
[8511.38s -> 8511.78s]  Whatever.
[8511.78s -> 8512.50s]  I'm fine over here.
[8512.50s -> 8517.62s]  Like 45% of the whole US economy is over here in California anyways.
[8518.18s -> 8518.66s]  I'm fine.
[8519.38s -> 8522.34s]  If I was my own country, I'd be the seventh richest country in the world.
[8526.28s -> 8527.56s]  It is you're fortifying right now.
[8527.56s -> 8529.00s]  You fortified something over there.
[8529.00s -> 8530.12s]  Oh, shit.
[8530.12s -> 8530.44s]  I'm sorry.
[8530.44s -> 8531.16s]  I didn't know it was my turn.
[8532.12s -> 8534.34s]  There's not much for us to fortify.
[8534.34s -> 8535.30s]  No, there's not much.
[8535.30s -> 8535.86s]  Sorry about that.
[8539.62s -> 8542.74s]  Carly, neither of us are attacking you because we know how this ends, right?
[8543.22s -> 8544.02s]  You're the only hope.
[8545.22s -> 8546.58s]  I don't think you guys understand.
[8546.58s -> 8551.35s]  There's just, we're running them thin as much as we can.
[8551.91s -> 8555.06s]  Hey, leave Montana.
[8555.78s -> 8556.98s]  Make it interesting.
[8556.98s -> 8561.91s]  Wait, actually leave Montana though.
[8561.91s -> 8563.27s]  It'd be like cringe if you took it.
[8563.27s -> 8565.05s]  Because then I'm out of the game.
[8565.05s -> 8565.69s]  That was cringe.
[8573.66s -> 8576.30s]  I think this is a little manifest destiny here.
[8576.94s -> 8578.46s]  Sorry, I'm offline.
[8578.46s -> 8579.50s]  The alliance is over.
[8579.50s -> 8580.06s]  That's what it just said.
[8580.06s -> 8580.70s]  Holy shit.
[8582.78s -> 8583.74s]  This is insane.
[8584.54s -> 8587.83s]  I want to see this board because I'm very curious.
[8589.03s -> 8589.99s]  It's insane.
[8589.99s -> 8590.79s]  I can see it now.
[8593.59s -> 8594.63s]  You're German.
[8594.63s -> 8595.67s]  I made an alliance with you.
[8595.67s -> 8596.55s]  Do you accept that you can see?
[8597.11s -> 8602.97s]  You got 13 over in that?
[8602.97s -> 8603.37s]  Yeah, that.
[8603.37s -> 8603.77s]  Okay.
[8603.77s -> 8604.01s]  Yeah.
[8604.89s -> 8607.19s]  I made that like analogy of like your friend
[8607.19s -> 8610.31s]  who invites you over just to kick your ass in the game earlier.
[8610.31s -> 8611.67s]  You got to let me spend one more.
[8614.33s -> 8614.73s]  All right.
[8615.45s -> 8615.93s]  I'll leave one.
[8618.02s -> 8619.38s]  You don't want to fuck with this out.
[8619.38s -> 8621.13s]  I'll tell you right now.
[8621.53s -> 8623.13s]  We get rowdy down here.
[8623.13s -> 8623.85s]  You left Germany.
[8623.85s -> 8624.73s]  You didn't leave me.
[8624.73s -> 8626.17s]  Charlie, I'm coming.
[8626.17s -> 8626.73s]  I'm coming.
[8626.73s -> 8628.41s]  Yeah, he did leave me and he didn't leave you.
[8628.41s -> 8630.90s]  I did leave him.
[8630.90s -> 8633.85s]  But just as an insurance policy.
[8633.85s -> 8635.37s]  What a fucked up weird election map.
[8635.37s -> 8637.61s]  Yeah, I was like the one independent party
[8637.61s -> 8640.89s]  that spent every cent that I own in one state.
[8644.28s -> 8645.56s]  I think I can win here.
[8645.56s -> 8649.48s]  I went to every single county in the entire state
[8650.81s -> 8652.57s]  and shook every single person's hand
[8652.57s -> 8655.13s]  to make sure that I got this one mistake.
[8656.76s -> 8658.20s]  This is so stupid.
[8660.90s -> 8663.30s]  You made a big mistake leaving Florida alive.
[8665.18s -> 8665.90s]  All right.
[8666.76s -> 8667.56s]  All right, gentlemen.
[8667.56s -> 8668.12s]  What you got?
[8671.22s -> 8672.34s]  I'm fucking coming.
[8674.38s -> 8675.10s]  Oh, my God.
[8675.74s -> 8676.54s]  Yeah.
[8676.54s -> 8678.54s]  Oh, Florida Gambit.
[8678.54s -> 8680.30s]  Hey, hey, come get me.
[8680.30s -> 8680.86s]  Come kill me.
[8680.86s -> 8681.74s]  Come kill me and take my cards.
[8681.74s -> 8683.40s]  I'm coming.
[8683.40s -> 8684.52s]  I'm working my way over.
[8684.52s -> 8685.64s]  That's actually genius.
[8685.64s -> 8686.52s]  You get those cards.
[8686.52s -> 8687.32s]  You get my cards.
[8687.32s -> 8695.03s]  You'll have to go through New Mexico.
[8695.03s -> 8696.63s]  Oh, I can't attack Arkansas from here.
[8696.63s -> 8696.87s]  OK.
[8698.17s -> 8699.53s]  Louisiana it is.
[8699.53s -> 8700.49s]  I hope you get a turn in.
[8701.29s -> 8701.93s]  We're coming in.
[8701.93s -> 8702.49s]  We're coming in.
[8702.49s -> 8702.89s]  I'm coming.
[8704.01s -> 8704.89s]  I'm coming.
[8704.89s -> 8706.49s]  Hold strong, New Mexico.
[8706.49s -> 8709.69s]  We go Oklahoma and then go to Colorado, I think.
[8709.69s -> 8710.49s]  No, no, you just go.
[8711.61s -> 8712.17s]  I can make it.
[8712.17s -> 8712.65s]  I can make it.
[8712.65s -> 8713.53s]  I can make it.
[8713.53s -> 8713.93s]  Turn in.
[8713.93s -> 8714.33s]  Come on.
[8714.33s -> 8715.69s]  You go around.
[8715.69s -> 8716.49s]  Come on.
[8716.49s -> 8717.37s]  We're strong.
[8717.37s -> 8718.73s]  Hold strong, German army.
[8718.73s -> 8719.53s]  We're squirming.
[8720.49s -> 8721.37s]  Yes.
[8721.37s -> 8722.01s]  There it is.
[8722.01s -> 8722.41s]  Turn in.
[8722.41s -> 8723.05s]  OK.
[8723.05s -> 8723.77s]  All right.
[8725.62s -> 8726.58s]  It was a mutual agreement.
[8727.30s -> 8727.62s]  Oh, shit.
[8727.62s -> 8728.58s]  I can't watch anymore.
[8729.48s -> 8731.24s]  No, you have to click spectate on the bottom left.
[8731.80s -> 8732.36s]  Yep.
[8732.36s -> 8732.84s]  Are you good?
[8733.64s -> 8739.50s]  There's no reason to push any.
[8739.50s -> 8740.38s]  Move one guy.
[8740.94s -> 8742.17s]  I wish I got you.
[8742.17s -> 8743.29s]  I wish I got you to turn in.
[8745.02s -> 8745.90s]  Oh, put him back.
[8745.90s -> 8746.46s]  What the fuck?
[8746.46s -> 8746.78s]  What?
[8746.78s -> 8747.50s]  Oh, God.
[8747.50s -> 8748.06s]  That's fine.
[8748.78s -> 8750.14s]  He's got 20.
[8750.14s -> 8750.46s]  What?
[8751.53s -> 8752.97s]  New Mexico is pretty strong.
[8753.96s -> 8754.76s]  Oh, my God.
[8757.69s -> 8759.85s]  I'm pushing you all the way back to Florida.
[8760.33s -> 8763.37s]  No, not if New Mexico has anything to say about it.
[8765.83s -> 8767.43s]  I'm doing the thing Connor said.
[8768.07s -> 8768.79s]  Stand strong.
[8777.26s -> 8778.86s]  The first game, I was hype on it.
[8778.86s -> 8781.70s]  This one, I'm sad.
[8781.70s -> 8784.10s]  You won't get through Florida this easily.
[8784.10s -> 8784.34s]  All right.
[8784.34s -> 8785.38s]  I'll give you one more turn.
[8785.38s -> 8789.59s]  Yeah, I was going to say, you got to do the like the gentleman rules,
[8789.59s -> 8792.15s]  which is like you guys are playing baseball game with a friend.
[8792.15s -> 8796.15s]  And it's like, oh, hey, just throw the ball like into the outfield one time.
[8796.15s -> 8799.59s]  I got to go on first base and then you try to score like running all the way home.
[8799.67s -> 8801.91s]  Do you guys ever do that?
[8801.91s -> 8802.55s]  I didn't do that.
[8802.55s -> 8805.11s]  But I never play baseball with my friends ever.
[8805.11s -> 8807.11s]  Yeah, I understand what you're saying, at least.
[8807.11s -> 8809.91s]  But I also like a lot of friends that play baseball in like a group, right?
[8809.91s -> 8815.19s]  I mean, yeah, throw the ball into the outfield.
[8815.19s -> 8821.66s]  And then like, I'm going to run around and go home.
[8821.66s -> 8822.39s]  Yeah.
[8822.39s -> 8823.99s]  Like, just commit an error.
[8823.99s -> 8829.45s]  Oh, wait, it's my turn.
[8829.45s -> 8830.65s]  Oh, this is sad.
[8830.65s -> 8834.34s]  You're age is showing.
[8834.34s -> 8835.77s]  Go Florida.
[8835.77s -> 8836.49s]  All right.
[8836.49s -> 8837.77s]  This is our last stand.
[8837.77s -> 8839.29s]  Come on.
[8839.29s -> 8840.73s]  It's coming for Georgia.
[8840.73s -> 8841.69s]  I'm on first base.
[8841.69s -> 8842.89s]  We're down by two runs.
[8843.61s -> 8844.81s]  Guy at the plate is up.
[8844.81s -> 8845.85s]  He like bunts.
[8846.98s -> 8848.34s]  Roll the ball in the outfield.
[8848.34s -> 8849.14s]  Give us a chance.
[8849.14s -> 8849.94s]  Come on, gentleman's rules.
[8849.94s -> 8851.62s]  I have a 0% win on all fronts.
[8852.50s -> 8858.66s]  Stats have been wrong before.
[8858.66s -> 8859.22s]  Yep.
[8859.22s -> 8859.78s]  I'm coming.
[8860.82s -> 8861.62s]  Wait a second.
[8864.55s -> 8864.95s]  Oh my God.
[8864.95s -> 8865.67s]  The last guy.
[8870.15s -> 8870.39s]  There it is.
[8870.39s -> 8874.07s]  All right, that Fortify there.
[8877.70s -> 8879.78s]  I just put the strongest soldier we had there.
[8879.78s -> 8880.98s]  Master Chief's in Florida.
[8883.67s -> 8885.03s]  61.
[8889.61s -> 8898.72s]  I think me and Charlie's alliance is a little too strong at the start. I didn't get shit out of the South
[8898.72s -> 8902.26s]  I think the game there's so much strategy to literally picking where you're going
[8903.98s -> 8907.24s]  Like at the start. Yeah, no, no people were just kind of we're just clicking
[8907.76s -> 8911.60s]  There was like there was like a real method to it that we should probably figure out
[8911.60s -> 8916.63s]  It's a little bit of a strategy where you want your want your boys to be fog of war makes it harder to
[8917.25s -> 8923.39s]  Yeah, I actually think that's why I was able to run throughs because I had an alliance with Charlie and I could see all the
[8923.61s -> 8929.55s]  Map. Mm-hmm cuz our alliance missing gas can't have friend request
[8930.73s -> 8939.40s]  You guys don't want to play a third one. Do you okay for whatever? I'm down if we like have like a setting
[8939.96s -> 8944.70s]  Maybe do better settings on that. There is a map called
[8946.86s -> 8955.63s]  Castle and it's just one castle and you own different sections of the castle cool
[8958.85s -> 8962.04s]  Interesting or this one's also kind of interesting
[8965.50s -> 8978.78s]  E by land. All right, we'll do one free by so wait, it was manual placement good or bad
[8981.94s -> 8986.62s]  It's okay. I mean auto makes it go faster. Yeah, it was definitely faster
[8987.46s -> 8994.81s]  Okay, let's do auto was fog of war good. I know strong opinion for me
[8996.33s -> 8999.18s]  Thanks a prime Zach. I'll keep it off
[8999.86s -> 9002.39s]  and then
[9002.39s -> 9012.54s]  Progressive card bonus. I'll keep on. All right code is in chat. We'll make this the finale
[9013.10s -> 9020.37s]  That's good playing MDOS games. I thought my fucking computer blue-screened like that
[9020.37s -> 9023.81s]  This thing just took up the whole screen and this one line of text. I was like my computer
[9023.81s -> 9033.61s]  I was about to say sorry. I gotta go do one second. All right, there's the code. I want to show anybody
[9035.94s -> 9040.14s]  Where do I use it?
[9040.42s -> 9049.32s]  Were you where you have every time? No, I can't let you personally hold on. I invited you person
[9049.32s -> 9063.49s]  What do I go to profile? Oh, here it is. Come on. Hold on. No, don't leave. What the heck did not mean to leave the game
[9063.49s -> 9088.18s]  I'm sorry. Yeah, can you send me another one? Okay, uh
[9090.46s -> 9093.66s]  The invite. Yeah, it says already sense
[9094.90s -> 9105.74s]  Hold on I can join and five tokens there. All right, let's go. I bought an alien guy. All right
[9106.38s -> 9108.87s]  All right, totally random. It's just a
[9109.55s -> 9114.64s]  Byland is a bunch of islands bunch of islands
[9115.44s -> 9119.41s]  Island. Yeah. Yeah, like the streamer. Is it like a
[9120.90s -> 9124.03s]  Collaboration I don't think so, but that'd be crazy
[9124.23s -> 9127.07s]  Oh my little alien guy was so cool
[9127.55s -> 9137.28s]  Okay, so it's Ludwig and then Charlie with the same colors. That's good. I'm glad that's been yeah the whole time
[9137.62s -> 9147.78s]  Yeah, and then Connor and then German. There's just like normal rules or what's weird. The only thing that's weird is it is
[9149.14s -> 9151.46s]  weird islands and
[9153.42s -> 9160.37s]  Progressive cards. Yeah, I don't know this map. Yeah, I don't either to be honest
[9160.61s -> 9162.91s]  But I do think I want
[9163.43s -> 9169.46s]  This I gotta go pee real quick. I'll be right back. My turns like three turns anyways. Yeah, you got time
[9169.46s -> 9177.63s]  Oh, I want to control barbecue. I also realized we were playing with kind of a cringe rule
[9179.83s -> 9185.36s]  It wasn't true random dice rolls. Yeah, you know, no
[9188.18s -> 9192.77s]  That was great
[9192.77s -> 9204.55s]  I knew those dice weren't random. I knew something was in them
[9206.33s -> 9241.68s]  They were they were weighted a little trouble a foot big man. It's you
[9242.62s -> 9246.14s]  Yeah, I'm thinking I'm trying to figure out the best plan of attack for me here
[9246.30s -> 9251.70s]  Wait, the names of these lands are all literally like Spanish youtubers. Wait, are they? Yeah
[9252.02s -> 9257.59s]  Dude, I think this might just be a map. He by actually made ours like Ludwig land
[9257.59s -> 9283.78s]  I want that did he buy get his own map in this game chat. I feel like I'm already losing
[9283.94s -> 9287.18s]  Did he earn like say?
[9288.02s -> 9296.15s]  Wow, yeah, that's what that's what balanced dice remove or random dice remove I should say I am back
[9297.12s -> 9307.34s]  Technically one soldier could be an army of a hundred. Why would they call any by land make sense?
[9307.54s -> 9315.22s]  Did you get something like the steam workshop? No, I just had it. I don't know. I've never played it before
[9315.22s -> 9319.86s]  It was just in my maps. I didn't have to like download it. I think he just did a partnership with the game
[9319.86s -> 9329.59s]  Oh, that's pretty Connor saying all the all the the the map names are just different youtubers all the different islands
[9329.59s -> 9340.10s]  Well, they are yeah different Spanish youtubers. Are they apparently it's like barbecue if you hit the the
[9341.45s -> 9346.57s]  Graph in the top on the left bar, and then you hit the globe icon. It'll show you them all
[9346.57s -> 9348.57s]  Oh, okay. I was gonna say there's like a
[9348.69s -> 9353.85s]  Industrial pier tech plant industrial cargo is like those interesting names like no
[9355.05s -> 9373.82s]  Yeah, he goes by block a go team. Don't spread yourself too thin Connor fortify. Yeah
[9374.10s -> 9386.31s]  I have no idea where I'm gonna go here. It is an interesting map. Mmm
[9386.47s -> 9390.30s]  Oh, they're all
[9390.30s -> 9396.87s]  Way, it's not what I meant to do at all. All right, you have actually a great start at the top that two four four
[9396.99s -> 9406.30s]  Do I don't know if you missed this but the the dice are true random now through random
[9406.30s -> 9414.42s]  Yeah before it was balanced. It was the saddest fucking thing. I threw four against one and lost. Oh god
[9414.90s -> 9424.25s]  Yeah, okay. Well, I mean I guess I could just
[9426.29s -> 9428.29s]  Blue has no idea what they're doing
[9440.33s -> 9445.17s]  My god the restaurants up there from me are very strong, you know, you don't
[9445.57s -> 9447.33s]  Chefs, I think it is actually game
[9447.33s -> 9454.77s]  I think true random you don't want to do blitz because you could just know is your entire army in one fell click
[9454.77s -> 9456.45s]  Oh my god
[9456.45s -> 9458.45s]  Lost like everybody. I think I
[9459.17s -> 9461.45s]  I just lost you did not lose the game
[9461.45s -> 9465.41s]  You have look at you got the guy in the bottom aisle with the three three two because you could do the same thing in
[9465.41s -> 9468.65s]  Return as well, right? That's yeah, that's true. Oh, that's so demoralizing
[9471.37s -> 9474.77s]  Those are the strongest chefs in the seven seas don't feel bad
[9476.13s -> 9481.02s]  Yeah, it's like some one-piece chef. Well, let's see. All right. Well, it could work in the reverse then couldn't it?
[9487.01s -> 9489.61s]  My boys are too strong in this one
[9490.33s -> 9499.48s]  Well, I'm going to end there because I'm very concerned about having no. Oh god. Okay, good game. All right
[9500.64s -> 9502.64s]  We're going over here
[9503.12s -> 9504.72s]  Hey, Charlie
[9504.72s -> 9509.80s]  Yeah, listen, I'm thinking an alliance. All right. I like I think red is cool
[9509.80s -> 9516.96s]  I'm trying to take on during the bottom, right? Mm-hmm. Maybe how is he already got plus nine
[9517.88s -> 9520.92s]  everybody Ludwig just every time just
[9521.52s -> 9526.76s]  Gets in an area and just starts building massive stacks so early
[9526.80s -> 9530.20s]  We got to get rid of this now and I'm gonna bring it up to the board
[9530.76s -> 9532.86s]  Blue you're blue
[9532.86s -> 9534.42s]  Okay, guys
[9534.42s -> 9541.59s]  We should we should get rid of Ludwig because he's already building like I'm also open to that
[9541.59s -> 9544.19s]  I'm open to like three versus one. Yeah, we can you can
[9546.39s -> 9551.43s]  Hey, I'm very much open to that. Hey relax everybody. Come on. Hey, come on
[9551.43s -> 9555.47s]  It's been an overwhelming cry out from the audience today that yellow has been cringe
[9555.47s -> 9560.55s]  Did you I think you are the audience who's been saying that we cannot let him get to?
[9561.11s -> 9567.66s]  Almost three four wins in a row. No way. I agree. It would be impressive though. You'd let's kill them
[9567.66s -> 9571.15s]  You'd almost be like wow great job Ludwig. It would be impressive
[9571.15s -> 9580.83s]  But it's been a pleasure watching you succeed so so much. Yeah, no
[9581.35s -> 9584.44s]  See one of these where those dice
[9585.30s -> 9591.00s]  Which is happy let's go on
[9591.20s -> 9593.60s]  What happened there? You didn't lose any troops on that fight
[9594.48s -> 9599.63s]  Alien dice Ludwig doesn't a alien us that I thought you're gonna give like a new avatar
[9599.79s -> 9606.20s]  Yeah, alien guys look weird they're hard to differentiate they have like they have weights in them
[9606.20s -> 9628.99s]  Okay, let's how much is the that prison area up there giving you a turn
[9629.87s -> 9631.87s]  So if you click on the left
[9631.91s -> 9638.41s]  Bars, and then you click the globe. It'll show you. Oh, okay. There's it's plus four. Yeah, it's the smallest on the map
[9638.65s -> 9642.55s]  Although I don't think the map is very balanced like honors should be giving way more than six
[9642.81s -> 9649.61s]  I'm gonna take the bottom left here, but I get five is crazy after that
[9649.61s -> 9651.61s]  I think we
[9652.29s -> 9660.94s]  Yeah, they're all you so I'm not gonna do blitz. Yeah, I think blitz is a mistake. I was I was normal rolling
[9660.94s -> 9668.85s]  Yes, he's gonna go like two one. Well. I mean it's always better to do three because you just have better. Wow, I'm going blitz
[9668.85s -> 9678.98s]  I mean you immediately won so fair enough perfect win again
[9681.47s -> 9689.59s]  And we will not attack each other Charlie you still need the little boat up there to get the bonus for that area
[9691.02s -> 9696.10s]  The the one I'm on yeah the five and the one on the left so my one at the bottom there
[9696.10s -> 9698.86s]  Oh, what? Oh, yeah, that's not good
[9698.90s -> 9699.38s]  Yeah
[9699.38s -> 9703.18s]  If you so Charlie if you click on the three the bar graph on the left and then you click the globe
[9703.46s -> 9706.26s]  And make it yellow a little it'll show you the outline of everything. Oh
[9707.02s -> 9721.13s]  Okay, I see unlucky unlucky didn't know that. Thanks a bit skip. What is your turn Ludwig? Okay?
[9721.13s -> 9727.06s]  I know exactly what you're doing. Wait. What do you think I'm doing? Talk to me. You're going
[9727.06s -> 9731.26s]  I mean, you're gonna you're gonna take it by right right? Yeah, very obviously
[9731.78s -> 9735.42s]  And then you're gonna go from there. You're gonna I think you're gonna go up
[9735.42s -> 9738.14s]  I don't think you're gonna go down this to way too much going on down here
[9738.14s -> 9740.22s]  You're gonna go up you're gonna wrap around try to go to the top, right?
[9740.22s -> 9748.55s]  You can try to secure the top, right and then you'll have any flanks. Can I be honest with you Jerma?
[9748.67s -> 9756.55s]  Hmm, you sound like a crazy person right now. I I am happy and content with just my two aisles
[9756.87s -> 9763.48s]  You buy an elo one, that's it for me. He's going top, right?
[9763.48s -> 9766.40s]  So we need to do everything in our power to prevent that from happening
[9769.04s -> 9770.64s]  Slander is almost
[9770.64s -> 9780.92s]  Back. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Jesus. That's right. What just happened. No, I was just taking the bottom, right?
[9783.54s -> 9786.94s]  Ludwig, how do you have your hand into every one of these things?
[9787.14s -> 9789.12s]  I
[9789.12s -> 9793.85s]  Look at the draw. I guess I don't know to claim the territories
[9794.09s -> 9799.94s]  You have all these all the boats your presence on every boat. I do have a lot of boat presence
[9800.06s -> 9803.76s]  Yeah, I like to say mobile. I guess I'm kind of a pirate at heart
[9803.76s -> 9807.86s]  I'm like you ever see the show one piece one of my favorite shows. I think it's why yeah
[9807.86s -> 9811.43s]  It's a great show you caught up on that. There's no way right?
[9811.43s -> 9822.15s]  Oh, I've seen like three episodes total 15 years ago. That's all you need and you gave it the rating great show
[9822.39s -> 9831.32s]  Yeah, German trusting you in top, right? Yeah. Oh, yeah, everybody's friends. Everybody's pals. Yeah, I would say you should probably take it
[9831.32s -> 9834.97s]  Yeah, maybe at some point
[9836.73s -> 9839.98s]  Charlie I'm gonna leave that. There's no revenue there alone
[9841.00s -> 9845.56s]  Okay, is it you guys are all talking amongst each other and kind of like it will listen
[9845.56s -> 9850.18s]  We're gonna have to start planning ahead here. Yeah, this is getting scary. It's ugly. What do you what do you do?
[9850.18s -> 9854.48s]  You want it to you with me Jerma?
[9854.48s -> 9862.46s]  Real really interesting. Yeah, like you mean it. I don't know if that's super beneficial though
[9862.58s -> 9867.98s]  I don't think it's beneficial for you. All right now, Drew. No, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
[9868.58s -> 9872.06s]  No, I'm sticking German German German German German. No, I'm sorry
[9872.06s -> 9876.06s]  We need to get him out of here and then we see what's left. You're not attacking Ibai
[9876.06s -> 9883.81s]  Are you um, I'm considering some my options that would be foolish. Well, I mean you got I've got a time limit here
[9883.81s -> 9892.59s]  So talk to me. What are your terms don't attack you by I don't attack any other territory except for you by are you gonna attack?
[9892.63s -> 9896.81s]  Charlie or or Connor? No, we're gonna attack us. I'm only taking the one
[9898.81s -> 9904.21s]  Think about it makes sense your one piece on the boat take everything I have over there by the way to and
[9904.53s -> 9907.13s]  Worriedly be I don't even care about those lawyers. I hate him
[9907.13s -> 9914.56s]  It's one of those can't live with him can't live without him say you can take those two honestly
[9914.56s -> 9921.37s]  I think I don't want to I'm kind of afraid because that's you you're spread out it too thin. Yeah
[9921.37s -> 9927.94s]  No, I think that's there. What do we get out of there? He'll get hold my man to stand out
[9927.94s -> 9929.94s]  He'll get it he'll get it by but that's all right
[9934.37s -> 9944.05s]  Forget about somebody troops. It's ridiculous. Hmm. I'm trying to think of a strategy we could pull off here
[9944.05s -> 9951.95s]  I'm just in the process Charlie Charlie. I have an idea. What's the idea hit me? This involves all of us
[9951.95s -> 9954.91s]  Okay, Charlie on the top there you have five, right? Yeah
[9954.91s -> 9959.75s]  Yeah, you could move one of those up to that port at the top left. That is one of Jerma's
[9959.75s -> 9964.15s]  Oh, yeah, and then you can go all the way around and fight little bit at the back
[9964.27s -> 9969.17s]  Yeah, it's gonna be a 4v4 or at least we at least we have like a border there
[9969.47s -> 9973.82s]  Oh that boy. Yeah, that is a that's a massive
[9974.58s -> 9990.89s]  Vulnerability right there. You're not attacking. No, I wouldn't dream of it. He's got so much man. He's got so much already
[9990.89s -> 9999.30s]  I might go for that that risky maneuver the old back door reach around
[10000.46s -> 10003.02s]  Guys hey
[10003.54s -> 10005.82s]  You know coming in. Oh my god
[10008.18s -> 10013.91s]  Charlie you know how I left you in the bottom left here. I have 11 guys. I didn't even touch you
[10014.23s -> 10018.43s]  Yeah, but you that's cuz you knew how strong the hearts were of those sailors. I'm coming in
[10019.11s -> 10021.11s]  the prison holds
[10023.35s -> 10025.35s]  Scary the prison junction holds
[10028.07s -> 10034.56s]  He's got the 11 right there that he can move up, but he cannot attack you with that 11 right now
[10034.88s -> 10039.32s]  You would have to fortify first don't get block C. No, come on
[10041.50s -> 10044.42s]  You might just want to leave him there and just see how he plays it
[10044.62s -> 10055.26s]  Yeah, I don't think there's any reason to take this whole thing and stay low what color I am green currently
[10055.34s -> 10060.35s]  Yeah, should I even bother getting block A and B?
[10062.68s -> 10067.92s]  I think you consider block a or B. I think I think you stay right there just because
[10068.62s -> 10074.34s]  You go down to the right you yeah, I can't take block C. I know that for sure
[10074.34s -> 10076.90s]  I just I was wondering if it was worth for block a and B
[10076.90s -> 10080.38s]  But probably not all right if he's gonna fortify up here hit he'll do it
[10080.70s -> 10083.98s]  So even if you take one of them, he'll do the other one
[10084.26s -> 10095.78s]  Yeah, true true true, and I know he can hear us right now, but you know what who cares hey you guys talking about one games
[10096.66s -> 10105.26s]  He's gonna attack from if I I don't I think he he's trying to get this boat
[10105.54s -> 10127.28s]  He wants to be able to have this attack front from the boat. That's where his reserves are gone. It is we win these
[10128.02s -> 10133.05s]  That's big. That was big. Yeah, we needed that we needed that really bad
[10133.81s -> 10136.01s]  Okay
[10136.01s -> 10143.75s]  We need this. That's big. No, it's not we lost. Oh, that's
[10144.99s -> 10150.19s]  That's all right. No, there's an opportunity cuz I I can put some troops up there and I could get rid of it
[10150.47s -> 10159.88s]  You a you're getting rid of my loading dock. Yeah, I mean come on. It's a loading dock these men need jobs
[10160.84s -> 10166.52s]  That's a vulnerability that gives you an opportunity to come in you could put you could put 15 troops there and just wipe us all
[10166.64s -> 10173.43s]  Right their families term. Oh, all right. Yeah. Well Charlie's an ally. Yeah, I'm gonna
[10174.03s -> 10183.69s]  You're just a little something, you know, all right
[10183.97s -> 10196.92s]  Should I I gotta at least put one here to get rid of the loading dock. I win this fight
[10196.92s -> 10199.88s]  I want you to know you're not winning. It won't be one against my loading dock soldiers
[10199.88s -> 10202.48s]  You're not and then I've got to get rid of them
[10202.48s -> 10212.06s]  I gotta load up some these are blue-collar men. You think a processing plant workers beating me start
[10212.06s -> 10214.06s]  Let's do the one. I know I need to do first here
[10215.98s -> 10224.12s]  Good nice good win. Very good. Very good. All right, we're out. Oh my god
[10234.20s -> 10238.24s]  I just hope we I just say, you know, I'm optimistic. Oh man, that's huge. I
[10239.73s -> 10244.53s]  Love that. That's huge. It's early. You won't like fortify up there though. You don't even want it
[10244.57s -> 10254.96s]  Can I even bring can I bring anybody up there I can yeah, you can bring those boys I need to get
[10255.76s -> 10257.76s]  We can't just let him steamroll this
[10259.15s -> 10271.64s]  We're you awfully dumb of Ludwig to like even try to take the top right because he's to worry about the top left
[10271.88s -> 10276.20s]  And the bottom left. Yeah, we've got him on his heels. Yeah, Charlie
[10276.20s -> 10282.60s]  You might be able to take if I next turn if I push from where oh from the three
[10283.36s -> 10288.74s]  If I push from the restaurant, oh, yeah, that'd be huge
[10289.26s -> 10294.94s]  That's uh, well now he's afraid that's how we know. He's terrified. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. They were in his head
[10295.86s -> 10304.10s]  That's what we wanted him to do. Watch these soldiers hold for us at the prison junction for my city. Oh
[10306.29s -> 10313.55s]  Boys, please god. Yes. Oh good fight. Hey, they're trying. They're trying. He lost a little bit there
[10313.75s -> 10317.33s]  He did he lost a little casualty. I did take a casualty
[10321.96s -> 10328.58s]  I
[10328.58s -> 10332.74s]  Hear that like the yellow nation like that. They don't really like want to fight like they're like tired of war
[10332.74s -> 10337.97s]  I don't want to like go back over there about my people. Yeah
[10341.95s -> 10345.75s]  Oh my god, you just got absolutely annihilated by my filter
[10348.03s -> 10349.53s]  It was a
[10349.53s -> 10355.19s]  92 percent chance. Yeah, we don't believe in numbers over here in Filter Bay. It's huge
[10356.19s -> 10359.01s]  actually huge and
[10359.09s -> 10365.49s]  92 percent chance. Yeah, it means nothing to us drain. I'm just I'm just here. I'm just coming in
[10365.49s -> 10371.09s]  I'm just coming in. How about that? How about that? Oh, wow, how about that baby? Oh, baby? This might be it for me boys. I
[10372.09s -> 10381.66s]  Really needed to stop them out there. That's tough. That's tough. Maybe I should just kept you loving. Okay
[10381.66s -> 10385.06s]  I don't love that. Hey, come on my three hold though. Imagine
[10385.54s -> 10392.22s]  Imagine block see they won't do it. How do I fight with any motivation? How do I know they're all conscripts?
[10392.70s -> 10400.15s]  You attack first and then you place troops after okay
[10402.59s -> 10413.52s]  No, yeah. All right. Do we want to take a bye from him? What's worth more?
[10414.32s -> 10416.00s]  advice worth more
[10416.00s -> 10426.24s]  Okay, but be crazy is you get damage on both so then he has no bonus. Just question me out
[10426.24s -> 10431.20s]  Oh, I sent all my troops. That's okay. That's okay. There's question me out boys. Oh
[10432.44s -> 10434.44s]  It's over for me
[10435.35s -> 10441.14s]  We've learned that we're working together now sounds like you're in the middle of a really great stretch
[10444.22s -> 10456.38s]  My backside pushed in by you three not to stress you out
[10457.10s -> 10464.96s]  You guys seem betray someone now. I am in no position for a betrayal. I don't own any territory
[10464.96s -> 10474.34s]  I own no territory. I have to sit this out for a while as well and I'm gonna make the I'm gonna I'm gonna
[10475.07s -> 10479.13s]  Charlie and Connor I'm gonna be like, yeah, I don't know man. I don't know any territory territory
[10479.13s -> 10482.96s]  So I'm not the one to you should attack and I've no oh
[10486.92s -> 10488.44s]  Harley
[10488.44s -> 10494.10s]  Why did you get ten troops? Oh, you have all the bots my gamer. I wasn't gonna say anything about it
[10494.10s -> 10499.58s]  I thought that that timer sound I thought Ludwig was you like really excited hitting your knee on your desk
[10501.10s -> 10504.05s]  Just cuz like he messed up there. No, no
[10504.05s -> 10508.45s]  I just thought the whole time you were like bump bump bump bump bump bump like using your knee like to hit because your
[10508.97s -> 10513.03s]  Discord indicator would pop up and I thought you making that sound
[10513.29s -> 10523.27s]  Yeah, like I thought he was going like like tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap under his desk
[10523.49s -> 10527.76s]  Like really like excited there it is
[10528.48s -> 10537.91s]  Brave the loading dock the blitz incident. Well, it was remember the blitz incident boys. Yeah, I mean you I'll roll over here for you
[10545.25s -> 10547.33s]  The order didn't make it down to the troops
[10549.85s -> 10555.10s]  Yeah, yeah, oh well, that's huge
[10556.10s -> 10558.27s]  I
[10561.81s -> 10567.50s]  Don't know this I guess move one of those guys
[10569.27s -> 10579.89s]  Don't have enough for that. Okay, and Ludwig intercepted the letter along the way what I can do here is
[10581.10s -> 10582.82s]  Charlie I can weaken
[10582.82s -> 10585.84s]  If I oh, yeah, good idea
[10586.12s -> 10596.38s]  so then you'd be able to easily take it by and then I would kind of settle up at a
[10597.02s -> 10599.02s]  Cristini Crist Cristini
[10599.94s -> 10604.22s]  Okay. Yeah, so that's a very tranquil space. Yeah, so I'll do what I can here
[10605.62s -> 10609.36s]  Because they're like adding letters. Oh
[10611.17s -> 10617.99s]  Excellent work. It's a perfect fight. My men didn't even hold a chance the warehouse holds. I don't even try. Okay
[10617.99s -> 10622.68s]  They also fell immediately. Okay. All right. So now you can handle this
[10623.48s -> 10626.44s]  Potentially down here. I don't know what he's gonna do with troops, but he can't put very many
[10627.56s -> 10629.24s]  He's in a tough spot right now
[10629.24s -> 10639.16s]  I've got it. I got it pretty locked down except for her bottom left. We're a little weak down there. I'm gonna just sit back here
[10639.60s -> 10643.30s]  All right
[10643.30s -> 10650.12s]  Let's do this first. Let's do this
[10651.38s -> 10659.67s]  Second, let's think this is important to do you're throwing your points in the trash
[10660.27s -> 10664.20s]  Yeah, I mean I look I don't own territory
[10664.28s -> 10669.48s]  They do I have to play nice for a while and then I'll settle up here build up some troops and then I can make a
[10669.52s -> 10670.28s]  move
[10670.28s -> 10672.08s]  Can't make a move right now
[10672.08s -> 10676.20s]  You don't want a repeat of what happened down there at filter Bailey. I'm telling you right now
[10676.96s -> 10689.96s]  I'm agreeing with you. Those filter boy filter Bay boys are built different. You might want to just avoid them entirely
[10690.60s -> 10706.29s]  Make three subs in it's not about the points. It's about sending a message
[10706.29s -> 10722.38s]  I think I just have to stop here. I don't give the opportunity to keep going
[10723.14s -> 10727.49s]  You think you're funny?
[10727.61s -> 10738.00s]  Somebody in chat said that I was just reading I am the actor they were the writer. I'm yeah, that's filter Bay
[10744.47s -> 10746.47s]  You can really make something happen here
[10747.43s -> 10749.31s]  Yeah, so
[10749.31s -> 10751.31s]  Maybe just locked down
[10751.51s -> 10767.54s]  E by so let's give like that. That's a lot. They get from them. That is a lot kill them
[10768.63s -> 10770.63s]  You're a little too excited here
[10771.19s -> 10780.90s]  Charlie check your DMS
[10780.90s -> 10786.34s]  DMS you like to distract me is that what's going on? No, just see on your screen. There should be something there. Oh
[10787.50s -> 10790.14s]  Little alliance he's trying to pull all the alliances back
[10790.98s -> 10797.08s]  Last to get your a last to game check this out. You see that message. Oh, that was very positive. Um
[10797.80s -> 10799.88s]  Where should I put the last troops? Where should I put the last troops?
[10801.66s -> 10803.66s]  You're gonna want to fort
[10805.09s -> 10814.56s]  Um, I wouldn't don't listen to him tell us he's gonna do you guys gonna have an alliance and he's gonna build a bunch
[10814.56s -> 10817.52s]  Of troops and then it's gonna be like, oh look Ludwig won again
[10817.52s -> 10823.42s]  He like conquered the whole entire place it up for that the fourth time in a row. I guess I have a question for you
[10823.42s -> 10826.14s]  Charlie, have you been having fun? Oh, yeah
[10826.14s -> 10834.96s]  I mean, so does it seem that bad if Ludwig wins again, you know, like well Ludwig winning has been kind of fun
[10835.36s -> 10837.72s]  That's what I'm saying if it's been fun
[10837.72s -> 10840.20s]  I have had a fun time
[10840.20s -> 10849.33s]  You know what you seem and I like this is gonna come off of like a little aggressive
[10849.45s -> 10854.45s]  But you seem perfect for you by like that's your place. I don't even want to have a piece of it
[10854.77s -> 10863.59s]  He's he's switching up. It's trust them guys. So you honor you care for them troops. Yeah, this is the bottom, right?
[10863.59s -> 10871.64s]  I think I'm gonna take top right bottom right gives six alone. Yeah, I think I'm gonna take the top right here
[10884.14s -> 10890.04s]  Be like a nice guy about it though, like I'm being like cordial everybody like I take from I'm in some yeah
[10890.04s -> 10894.84s]  I have united all of you in one simple goal of vanquishing me
[10895.04s -> 10903.80s]  But if I'm looking at the map right now Charlie and Connor just dwarfing you Jerma. Yeah, but that's okay
[10903.80s -> 10909.92s]  I I've been I'm getting a territory here next turn. Yeah, we're like pals. Are you cool about it? Yeah
[10910.92s -> 10912.92s]  be going from
[10913.08s -> 10918.64s]  Christine's work. Oh, we can't okay. Are you really getting that? I don't know if you're getting it. Okay
[10919.00s -> 10923.74s]  That's a luck. I guess game work. I mean, I don't hear any terms from you
[10923.74s -> 10930.98s]  I I'm not saying any terms because I don't feel like I'm the one who's gonna lose first. I think you are interesting
[10930.98s -> 10947.14s]  That's huge. You need to come to me in this spot. It's huge. Yeah fucking huge man. You have to have cars or something, right?
[10953.32s -> 10961.12s]  Troops it's pretty big. It's pretty big. All right. I uh, I'm gonna grab

[10968.68s -> 10972.88s]  Oh, I'm fine. Wait, what do you I wasn't listening? What was that? I'm going for Christina knee
[10973.28s -> 10981.20s]  He says that Christina knee and then oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, you're cool. Don't take any bye not e-buy, but
[10986.00s -> 10988.44s]  Bit of a loose character
[10994.85s -> 11000.60s]  Smooth beautiful. I'm very sorry. I did not want to do that. But trying to have some troops, you know
[11001.16s -> 11007.14s]  Hold on. But wait, wait, wait, wait
[11007.14s -> 11017.09s]  I'm just making sure there wasn't any orange down here that I missed you're looking at. I'm not looking you're peeping
[11017.81s -> 11019.57s]  It's okay to pee
[11019.57s -> 11021.57s]  Alright now I can I actually get some troops?
[11022.37s -> 11030.80s]  Yeah, guys, this is where I just build troops
[11030.80s -> 11037.42s]  I put like 60 people here eventually just sleeping in the back and then I've run over everybody in the last five minutes
[11037.42s -> 11040.78s]  I'm gonna have like a hundred troops under one spot the fight on Tank Bay. Oh
[11041.76s -> 11045.16s]  My god, but they're all gonna fight each other. I'm gonna be sitting right here
[11045.24s -> 11046.90s]  It's a bad start
[11046.90s -> 11048.52s]  We trade one for one
[11048.52s -> 11051.28s]  Round two. Come on Tank Bay Tank Bay. Oh, let's go
[11052.28s -> 11057.80s]  That's right. They don't want to be back under your rule. Come on. Thank baby. Oh, yes
[11059.24s -> 11061.24s]  We went to here. Good. Damn it. Come on
[11062.44s -> 11064.20s]  Damn

[11072.33s -> 11076.18s]  All right, that's all right. They fought pretty well. They lost way too much there
[11080.76s -> 11082.76s]  You're gonna know where to go. Yeah, you're gonna go
[11085.67s -> 11087.75s]  Don't worry about what's going on over here. I just want you to know
[11089.01s -> 11095.68s]  Next turn I i'm about to go sicko mode really that scares me. I don't like him saying that
[11096.40s -> 11098.80s]  It's gonna be crazy. I said he said that it was bad for us
[11102.48s -> 11105.28s]  It'll be like something taught in history books. It'll be like the sicko mode war
[11108.45s -> 11112.53s]  One of the quotes would be like that was huge from a fallen commander. What are we gonna do?
[11113.25s -> 11117.25s]  Uh with this the bottom one this one here this uh, we're lib
[11118.95s -> 11120.95s]  We have to somebody's got to claim that
[11122.23s -> 11125.83s]  Um, those are points that are not being used big man big man
[11127.91s -> 11129.38s]  Um
[11129.38s -> 11135.35s]  Jerma, i'll uh, i'll cede it to you in exchange for a unbreakable alliance big man. You're not you're not coming in
[11135.43s -> 11137.43s]  You got to just hold the borders
[11137.67s -> 11147.65s]  Yeah, no, i'm not coming in it is but what if I was I think it would be bad for you. But what if I
[11148.69s -> 11151.49s]  But what if I was I I I would
[11152.50s -> 11156.74s]  Highly recommend what is the not cringe alliance think do I crash in
[11159.70s -> 11162.34s]  Oh, let's let's confer with the cringe alliance for a second
[11162.90s -> 11164.34s]  um
[11164.34s -> 11166.34s]  I think you I think you could do it
[11166.50s -> 11169.59s]  But just be be crazy. It'd be a wild move
[11170.71s -> 11175.59s]  On his next turn he might sweep down here and take out uh and take out barbecue
[11176.23s -> 11181.19s]  He does have three cards to combine you tell what do you want me to do boys? I'll do you tell me
[11181.59s -> 11183.67s]  I think hold yeah, that's a good idea jerma
[11184.31s -> 11186.31s]  Well, he wants you to like that
[11188.39s -> 11190.39s]  Actually kind of do sound like that you're right
[11190.95s -> 11194.95s]  Probably not this turn. I'm just i'm just gonna hold for this one. Actually, I think jerma's right
[11195.11s -> 11199.97s]  It's a good idea jerma actually speaking some facts today. No, don't catch me. I said a dunkin donuts
[11202.37s -> 11209.40s]  Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. I haven't been a dunkin donuts in like four years. All right hogging the airways here jerma
[11209.40s -> 11217.17s]  Come on, please one alliance. Whoa connor seems a little hungry
[11218.02s -> 11220.58s]  No, no, i'm just taking the top right. That's what we all agreed on
[11221.06s -> 11225.54s]  What's that five doing down there you attacking you're just gonna protect my voters cringe alliance
[11225.86s -> 11230.90s]  I guess yeah, it seems like you're attacking riven. Oh, do I need to use these do I have to use my cards now?
[11231.22s -> 11237.38s]  Yellow could kind of get a little wacky on the top left or top right over there kind of crash into that back
[11237.46s -> 11243.94s]  Yep, that backbone over at prison and I can't because then I will get absolutely demolished and back ranked by ebi
[11244.82s -> 11249.41s]  Uh, what oh, I guess I have to do this
[11251.11s -> 11253.11s]  I have to use these. Oh, yeah
[11253.75s -> 11255.75s]  Five cards max five cards. Okay
[11257.33s -> 11260.93s]  Oh my god, connor. You have such a big attack coming up. I can feel it in my bones. Holy shit
[11261.09s -> 11263.81s]  It's okay. I'm not listen. We're all guys. It's all we're all boys
[11264.13s -> 11271.57s]  We're just keeping it together here just some fortifications a couple of guys fortifying a lot of fortifications almost
[11272.29s -> 11276.13s]  Hold connor looks by the way impenetrable right now. No, no, no
[11276.45s -> 11279.73s]  Don't let this don't let this snake influence you
[11280.31s -> 11281.75s]  I i'm, hey
[11281.75s -> 11289.09s]  I'm sitting here and i'm seeing who's gonna write the history books and his name's connorese pants germination will be forgotten fast
[11290.85s -> 11297.99s]  Don't listen to him. Don't listen to him attributed tons to science and history and culture. You're not attacking here connor. Are you no?
[11298.23s -> 11314.28s]  No, we're just keeping everybody. We're just hanging out everybody's friends everybody's pals. Yeah, don't be fooled by this nonsense. He's got 16 troops
[11314.92s -> 11317.96s]  That's more than I have
[11317.96s -> 11323.20s]  There we go. We're bumping their legs here
[11323.52s -> 11337.83s]  I think somebody has to take this bottom one. Are we okay that I can i'm taking um, yeah
[11339.03s -> 11357.48s]  Really be worse. Okay. Let's make sure this confirmed before I go for it. Oh shit. I did this wrong
[11361.99s -> 11363.99s]  Oh, I lost a lot. Um
[11364.71s -> 11366.71s]  All right. I accidentally did not it's okay
[11367.43s -> 11370.21s]  That's fine. It's fine
[11370.21s -> 11372.21s]  No, it's it's fine
[11376.85s -> 11388.31s]  It's a big scary number 12
[11390.87s -> 11392.87s]  Oh my god, whoa
[11396.21s -> 11398.21s]  You don't want to come through filter bay
[11399.14s -> 11403.14s]  They don't like you they don't appreciate you. It's not going bad for me so far
[11418.00s -> 11423.86s]  No, dos was not murdered after this. I think this is the last game. I'm gonna play some dos after this
[11424.50s -> 11431.01s]  It's only 10 o'clock. It's not late. I think I
[11432.53s -> 11447.48s]  Might have to
[11447.48s -> 11452.40s]  Where are you going?
[11452.40s -> 11456.48s]  Let him if you attack that don't do it. I'm not even thinking about that connor
[11456.64s -> 11464.47s]  I think it's kind of fucked up. We're doing the charlie right now is one of my eyes a little this is a little
[11464.55s -> 11466.55s]  Fuck, it's a little messed up
[11471.11s -> 11473.11s]  That car turning was ridiculous
[11473.35s -> 11475.43s]  None of us are liking that. We're all like allies
[11477.36s -> 11482.32s]  Are you fucking kidding me? I made that mistake. Yes. Oh, it still worked out for you
[11483.67s -> 11485.91s]  um
[11485.91s -> 11494.36s]  Very spread out though
[11494.68s -> 11500.63s]  You could have said I had to move exact thing that he just did
[11502.34s -> 11503.56s]  Huh?
[11503.56s -> 11507.40s]  Now we can do the same exact thing and I could just march through your back line
[11507.96s -> 11510.36s]  Yeah, no, I I i'm seeding
[11510.92s -> 11512.84s]  Elo huan. Oh, yeah
[11512.84s -> 11515.27s]  Okay
[11515.27s -> 11519.51s]  I have moved to the bottom left. I feel uncomfortable in cito huan and elo huan
[11519.51s -> 11522.95s]  I think you guys have done a bad job of controlling connor and I think his top right
[11524.39s -> 11529.01s]  Somebody said the psycho play is to immediately right now turn and take this right side from charlie
[11530.24s -> 11532.24s]  Oh, and uh, that's a bad idea
[11533.12s -> 11535.12s]  charlie then immediately gets
[11535.68s -> 11538.32s]  These I mean, he's got 24 troops over here. I'm toast
[11539.33s -> 11543.78s]  I need to wait another few turns before I make any decisions. I want you to know that
[11544.42s -> 11546.66s]  That's but yeah, that's fine. I still I need this though
[11551.04s -> 11553.20s]  I'm marching. I'm marching. That's all you
[11553.92s -> 11559.24s]  Oh, this is good for me. Your troops are gonna be spread here
[11560.20s -> 11565.68s]  You're gonna have like three and a b and c. Oh, it's gonna be ugly
[11568.85s -> 11573.89s]  We can how do I stop that from happening? You can't you gotta have at least three when you leave a territory
[11573.89s -> 11579.75s]  It's weird. You can't do just one after you get something unless you bring them all trail you
[11581.14s -> 11583.14s]  This dm connor that area
[11583.46s -> 11585.14s]  That's super weird
[11585.14s -> 11590.58s]  Yeah, I think it is intentional. I can't there can be no desire. I'm orange thing until ludwig is gone
[11590.74s -> 11593.62s]  Don't you understand because if I betray charlie right now
[11594.02s -> 11597.62s]  Ludwig's still there charlie good around we're gonna be like I needed it. Oh look
[11598.82s -> 11603.94s]  See what happened you see what happened? He'll scream and and then the two of them will will kill me and connor
[11604.58s -> 11606.66s]  I'm telling you right now. That's exactly how it's gonna play out
[11607.67s -> 11611.91s]  That's exactly what will happen. I have to be careful
[11619.24s -> 11620.12s]  Oh
[11620.12s -> 11622.12s]  back to back hard
[11622.20s -> 11627.00s]  Wow, he's rolling like you gotta be careful. I think you can take him out here. That's what i'm you gotta be careful
[11627.80s -> 11629.80s]  Oh shit, i'm thinking
[11631.48s -> 11634.44s]  Yeah, that's what i'm thinking. I think we closed this one out from him
[11634.84s -> 11639.40s]  I think you're closing this one out as a whole connor to be clear. I don't oh my god
[11639.80s -> 11645.32s]  I think connor runs rampant. We're gonna keep the march going. It's a gg situation for all of us here
[11645.32s -> 11647.32s]  I want you guys to know no
[11647.88s -> 11649.88s]  Oh
[11657.72s -> 11661.56s]  They were like in the new we don't like blue and barbecue so we say it's a phrase
[11662.12s -> 11666.04s]  They do say that. Oh my god. Why can't I oh you made a mistake you skipped silo b
[11667.16s -> 11673.49s]  It's a blunder. This is stupid. He skipped silo b. What an error doesn't make any sense
[11674.28s -> 11676.45s]  I know I didn't oh no
[11676.53s -> 11679.41s]  Well, no, because you have to go back and now you have to leave three troops because you went back
[11679.65s -> 11686.77s]  You're still okay though. No, it's over. You're not getting all of me. I want you to know you've left me alive
[11687.01s -> 11691.89s]  Which will be your downfall. That's all right. At least I kept my my allies alive
[11693.81s -> 11700.76s]  And that that fight over there at barbecue was one for the history books inspirational, huh? How about that?
[11701.32s -> 11711.27s]  They fought hard. They really did and ottoman died when you think about it at the end of the day. There's no country for
[11714.31s -> 11716.47s]  Uh, there's a timer isn't there? Oh
[11717.27s -> 11722.08s]  That's right through bay for you. Not even close
[11722.80s -> 11727.04s]  Oh, I ran out of time
[11727.04s -> 11729.04s]  Okay
[11729.20s -> 11735.92s]  I just have germa. Can I make a deal with you? It depends. Uh, yeah, you
[11736.48s -> 11741.99s]  Hear me out first. Uh-huh. I'm getting to that stage where ludwig is pretty much on the ropes
[11742.55s -> 11746.71s]  He's got really nothing here. He's got he's got this little bit. It's pretty desperate
[11747.43s -> 11752.31s]  He has one card so he's got nothing so he's probably gonna be one of you guys will take that card
[11752.95s -> 11757.17s]  He's got nothing germa. He's got nothing essentially what i'm gonna have to say is i'll just
[11758.21s -> 11761.65s]  I'll take these two down here. I'll take whirlybee now
[11762.53s -> 11764.13s]  You guys can finish
[11764.13s -> 11766.45s]  One of you will finish him off and get his one card
[11767.27s -> 11770.55s]  I will chill here in the middle until we find out our next course of action
[11771.43s -> 11773.43s]  Which will be we'll figure that out when we get there
[11774.31s -> 11776.31s]  Mmm, cool. Okay. I like that
[11776.31s -> 11777.11s]  I don't
[11777.11s -> 11781.35s]  Thank you. Can I chime in? I don't like that. So what would what would you suggest?
[11782.23s -> 11784.23s]  I would suggest you
[11784.64s -> 11787.52s]  Not only get yourself a little bit of whirlybee
[11788.40s -> 11789.60s]  invade
[11789.60s -> 11790.80s]  also
[11790.80s -> 11797.19s]  Revan and under weaken them all. All right, this is your time to dominate just get one on each
[11797.51s -> 11803.28s]  They don't need the bonus. You're running out of daylight. By the way, you gotta you gotta roll. Oh
[11805.92s -> 11811.38s]  Jeremy you gotta take a that part in uh, at least two there and just give that to you
[11811.62s -> 11816.04s]  Yeah, i'll take that for now. We have that bonus take that for now and then
[11816.84s -> 11819.40s]  I was relocating your troops. I put them on city pier yesterday
[11820.85s -> 11822.85s]  Whoa?
[11824.20s -> 11826.58s]  Ayo

[11845.40s -> 11851.94s]  Big man, you want some of that land bag load? I mean
[11855.73s -> 11865.06s]  Big man charlie. I don't know where he is charlie. No, did he go to the bathroom?
[11867.70s -> 11869.70s]  He didn't see any of that
[11870.18s -> 11874.42s]  Okay, nobody say anything don't say anything. Uh, just tell him i'm gonna tell him my cat walked across the keyboard big man
[11874.50s -> 11878.26s]  Big man, I need to arrange an alliance with you. Oh, what the fuck just happened
[11878.66s -> 11883.22s]  Germa invaded your land and is threatening to take the rest of it. I need safe harbor
[11884.37s -> 11889.59s]  Can you provide me with safe harbor? Why why did germa attack? He literally just attacked
[11890.79s -> 11893.11s]  Because connor is dominating and he wants to win
[11894.56s -> 11899.86s]  He's actually a snake. He's actually asking you. Will you provide me safe harbor? He's whispering lies
[11900.26s -> 11902.90s]  I'm asking for for just oh, I had to
[11903.46s -> 11909.70s]  Charlie I had to attack here because he is his plan is he's gonna try to wrap around
[11910.10s -> 11913.06s]  To try to kill you at a one here where my aid is right now
[11914.56s -> 11918.24s]  But you talk about I needed I needed to fortify this section in the top left because he has six
[11918.32s -> 11921.60s]  He's gonna come through he's gonna try to he was gonna say you're worried about my six
[11922.16s -> 11927.28s]  My six charlie use the thing. I want to take prison junction and I want you to save me from
[11928.14s -> 11933.91s]  Demolition and misery. I went to tinkle. I didn't see what actually happened. I don't know what kind of
[11934.53s -> 11940.95s]  Diplomatic snakery was done here. Oh my god. Nothing on my end. Nothing on my end. I pray, okay
[11940.95s -> 11947.12s]  You know what charlie? I am hiding on block a still attacking by the way. I told you i'm not attacking
[11947.20s -> 11949.20s]  I'm trying to find safe passage
[11949.76s -> 11951.60s]  Fuck
[11951.60s -> 11956.16s]  You can choose to stomp me out like a god damn piece of meat
[11957.17s -> 11959.17s]  Look, he's even he's blocking your troop movements, man
[11959.41s -> 11962.84s]  No, i'm not i'm block a i'm block a block. It doesn't block anything. That's the thing about
[11963.88s -> 11969.84s]  12 up to the top left. He can't get him over there charlie. You are on threat of extinction
[11969.84s -> 11972.56s]  I don't know what to do. I am not i'm not going to attack
[11973.20s -> 11974.40s]  Any more goodbye?
[11974.40s -> 11978.80s]  That was the whole purpose was to get here to make it so you couldn't go over here because there was one troop here
[11979.04s -> 11981.04s]  i'm coming up into
[11981.36s -> 11984.64s]  Take back exactly exactly take it back. Take it back. Bye
[11985.20s -> 11989.44s]  I will I will get out of it. Bye. I mean 39 troops is a lot. Don't stop anybody
[11989.76s -> 11993.60s]  All right, you could take a little bit of christianini. I'm thinking i'm thinking
[11994.00s -> 11997.76s]  I think I think you have to invade a bit of christianini. He's a mad man
[11998.56s -> 12001.36s]  You could also go south too a little bit of south action wouldn't hurt you
[12001.76s -> 12005.36s]  You know fighting that eight would be bad because that's a lot to lose potentially
[12005.92s -> 12009.92s]  I fought eight one time in barbecue and it was a mistake you you win this eight you win
[12010.64s -> 12014.00s]  You sure do but you also get two cards if you get rid of lugwig right now
[12014.64s -> 12019.57s]  But remember the alamo
[12021.56s -> 12023.56s]  I know what I know what I need to do
[12023.80s -> 12027.64s]  Don't forget what happened in mexico. He's making a huge play here. I I know what I have to do
[12028.28s -> 12031.80s]  You're running out of time. You're running out of daylight. You got a getty by land before the end of this turn
[12034.53s -> 12036.53s]  Holy holy shit, man. That was huge
[12037.17s -> 12041.49s]  You also should invade whirly b. You shouldn't kill me. You have to get a by land. I have

[12084.37s -> 12089.81s]  Connor is gonna run over some cities. Connor's gonna take over all of charlie's board at this point
[12090.52s -> 12094.20s]  No, you have to finish let off first. I equalized it
[12097.09s -> 12102.44s]  Connor you should go from the south and just chew through testing testing. Is this low?
[12103.48s -> 12109.84s]  It's it's this is such a throw. It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. Yeah, I just found this discord call. I don't know how I got here
[12111.78s -> 12116.34s]  I just found this discord call. I don't know how I'm taking let out. You can see how it's so political, huh?

[12156.05s -> 12160.29s]  Where is it? I don't know how I got in this discord call, but I somebody help. I got the wrong uh server ID
[12160.29s -> 12162.29s]  I think the fuck is that?
[12166.95s -> 12168.95s]  Yeah, i'm trying to find it
[12169.35s -> 12176.71s]  Right now who's talking why is it not on the thing? Um, someone typed in chat jerma's worst joke coming up
[12178.87s -> 12183.75s]  I already did it and it was the worst joke because nobody reacted to it. Oh, you're wasting my turn
[12186.15s -> 12187.43s]  Oh, yes
[12187.43s -> 12188.71s]  Wait, hold on
[12188.71s -> 12193.24s]  That's letting me in my head. He's wasting my turn. Who's screen sharing me? I need one screen share
[12193.81s -> 12197.84s]  He was trying to bait me man. Can anybody hear me?
[12199.59s -> 12201.76s]  Charlie yep
[12209.84s -> 12214.16s]  No, you baited me what do you I just I'm out of the game. What do you want for me?
[12216.88s -> 12219.52s]  I won't let me screen share the game. It's not an application
[12221.49s -> 12225.65s]  Guys, I think I got in the wrong discord call. I don't know how I got in here. I got the wrong server ID
[12225.65s -> 12228.37s]  I don't know what's happening. Somebody can troubleshoot with me jerry's screen
[12229.01s -> 12233.09s]  Guys, I think I got in the wrong call. I don't know how I got in here. I got the wrong server ID
[12233.17s -> 12239.65s]  I don't know what's happening. Somebody can troubleshoot with me do the whole thing share the whole thing. Don't be shy
[12240.45s -> 12242.45s]  Yeah, are you oh you screen sharing? Yeah, okay
[12245.14s -> 12249.22s]  So if i'm gonna have to go I think guys, I think I got the wrong discord call
[12249.30s -> 12251.30s]  I don't know how I got in here. I got the wrong server ID
[12251.30s -> 12254.18s]  I don't know what's happening. Somebody can troubleshoot with me. I think I have to go up here
[12254.74s -> 12258.02s]  Who is that guy? What a weird guy. That's because weird
[12258.90s -> 12262.80s]  Is that somebody in the call who's that sounds like an absolute loony for sure
[12275.48s -> 12280.76s]  Oh, we didn't even put up a fight. I didn't have time to strategize last time. I was too busy trying to figure out a screen share
[12283.12s -> 12285.12s]  Oh my god, we're not even fighting anymore
[12287.89s -> 12293.89s]  This this can't be anything except for what happened right? I was I thought charlie was gonna be it was gonna be me and him
[12295.40s -> 12297.40s]  Jerm was having a crazy rally right now
[12298.04s -> 12303.32s]  Charlie lost charlie lost almost all his army trying to kill me. That's true. I did you made a mistake
[12303.88s -> 12308.98s]  I think I gotta stay like this. I don't think I can do anything else
[12313.54s -> 12315.62s]  It's been on for hours now
[12316.82s -> 12326.58s]  I I forgot your old voice
[12326.58s -> 12331.22s]  Connor's troop count is outrageous. I mean the good thing is he thoroughly messed up trying to kill me off
[12331.78s -> 12337.32s]  charlie, I think your uh best bet here is to uh, it's so embarrassing because
[12338.04s -> 12341.96s]  You know, I was I don't think you can beat me. I was gonna be on I don't think you can fight those really
[12342.28s -> 12346.68s]  Like I was just talking like that. I don't think so either. I think if you if you uh
[12347.48s -> 12349.25s]  protect e by land
[12349.25s -> 12351.73s]  Specifically the bottom left to be by land. That's your best bet
[12351.81s -> 12354.53s]  It's supposed to be like a guy is just talking and i'm talking
[12355.25s -> 12357.25s]  Take it down with me. You know what i'm saying? No
[12358.37s -> 12361.01s]  You're because you can band together and fight as the weird guy
[12361.01s -> 12364.45s]  Jermy won't attack you because he knows you are his ticket to winning. What the fuck have I done?
[12365.17s -> 12370.36s]  I don't know. I don't know. I mean look i've got I got five cards
[12372.23s -> 12377.59s]  Yeah, he could he could pull out something crazy. He has to cash out 20 troops next turn and if i'm telling you
[12377.91s -> 12380.08s]  Whoever wants to come for me
[12380.08s -> 12383.84s]  I think if you go bottom left to be by land, that's square next to the boat
[12386.39s -> 12390.31s]  Here's the thing. I've seen me throw these before like I haven't said this game's done
[12394.68s -> 12400.60s]  Everyone's making good points. I'm not listening to them. Let's ride. Oh, oh no madness. Oh
[12404.20s -> 12409.25s]  It was an error god damn it how many more charlie go to the right go to the right side
[12409.65s -> 12411.65s]  Ah
[12412.61s -> 12424.93s]  He's more greeds than man. All right. That's all right. All right stretched thin like a pizza
[12425.09s -> 12433.35s]  I take everything with me. I would be careful though. This is coming up there. There was actually
[12434.60s -> 12438.34s]  Jerma could die
[12438.34s -> 12444.34s]  Well, at least I said connor could kill jerma connor could win this turn actually
[12446.00s -> 12449.36s]  You have a lot of faith in me. No, no, because you also have the cards in the bottom left connor
[12450.55s -> 12452.61s]  Oh, I do
[12452.61s -> 12454.61s]  I should not have told you that
[12454.77s -> 12460.71s]  They were placating me so bad too like the oh who's that weird guy what will kill you is your indecisiveness
[12461.57s -> 12462.85s]  That's true
[12462.85s -> 12472.15s]  Oh my god, 25 troops. Well, it's a lot of troops. That'll never be enough to break us
[12475.43s -> 12480.31s]  I mean it is enough. I don't think he's quick enough to break you. That's another great laugh
[12480.39s -> 12484.15s]  I guess like I mean, I don't know. I guess we'll just like kind of placate that he's doing this thing
[12484.95s -> 12486.95s]  We're trying to put troops down but you know, whatever
[12487.59s -> 12490.39s]  Oh, it'll be sad if jerma dies before being able to cash in those cards
[12490.87s -> 12493.43s]  I'm just i'm not even i'm not kill i'm just taking up here, you know
[12493.99s -> 12498.63s]  I mean you could i'm if you do you're gonna get five cards, which is a guarantee whoever
[12499.51s -> 12502.39s]  Kills me gets the last hit is guaranteed to win the game
[12503.43s -> 12512.37s]  Yeah, because you immediately get to re-up you get to repop for another 20 30 troops probably just keep it moving
[12512.93s -> 12515.65s]  Yeah, you're gonna have to go all the way here keep the guys going
[12516.37s -> 12524.66s]  Here we go
[12524.66s -> 12531.00s]  Uh, here we go. These guys are gonna come over here speed. That's the problem. Here we go
[12531.81s -> 12533.81s]  All right, guys, we're just gonna keep moving around
[12535.46s -> 12537.70s]  That's one bad blitz. This is it. That's it
[12538.26s -> 12540.26s]  That's it. I'm so sorry, man
[12541.12s -> 12544.24s]  You're a good ally, you know, I think I think like the new country that's like the whole world
[12544.24s -> 12546.24s]  I think it's gonna be like really good for like the people
[12546.24s -> 12549.92s]  Hey, i'm i'm really glad that you got the cards though because we've had an alliance the whole time
[12550.48s -> 12554.96s]  Yeah, for sure. Well, you've all to be clear. You've all had an alliance the whole time to kill me
[12555.89s -> 12562.29s]  Yeah, it was pretty poetic it was like in code geass where the world united against lelouch. Yeah, it was actually like that
[12562.85s -> 12565.17s]  Except it wasn't an honorable thing that I was doing
[12565.81s -> 12567.25s]  Oh, I see
[12567.25s -> 12576.00s]  It was more like a sad like a sad thing. Everyone hated me. It was like world war two timers moving real quick
[12576.88s -> 12579.76s]  Yeah, you're gonna have to finish me now or never at all
[12581.20s -> 12584.08s]  Clicking oh we took 10
[12584.88s -> 12587.12s]  That was a huge huge win at tech plant
[12587.68s -> 12590.08s]  Problem is connor doesn't care about his men. He'll throw them into harm's way
[12590.48s -> 12595.44s]  It's all right. They're fighting for like the good of the republic kind of does I have three cards myself, actually
[12596.16s -> 12600.72s]  I hope they're correct and not like misaligned. No, they're not correct
[12601.44s -> 12603.44s]  But they're there. Oh my god
[12603.76s -> 12611.46s]  Let me get over there. You don't have cards for you charlie. He's got three. He left you
[12611.46s -> 12613.46s]  Oh my god
[12615.78s -> 12619.38s]  I can shift some things around. Oh my god
[12622.66s -> 12634.74s]  I got the wrong uh surfer idea. I think I don't know where to put them. Oh, okay bumper connor's cat can sense something's wrong
[12634.98s -> 12642.66s]  Yeah, he's just I didn't I muted I did that for you guys that that is saying speed is of the utmost importance
[12642.74s -> 12647.78s]  You are not showing that off today. This is gonna be
[12648.98s -> 12650.98s]  I can't believe that just happened. Wow
[12651.06s -> 12657.06s]  Yikes, did he lose a lot? He lost about like 15 men. Well, it's one troop. They fought hard there, man
[12657.46s -> 12659.46s]  They love their country ghosts of kiev
[12660.34s -> 12664.24s]  I'm biting my lip so hard
[12664.32s -> 12669.28s]  You're not going through this. Are you? No, you gotta stop. You gotta stop. No, no, no, no. I'm just taking this boat
[12670.24s -> 12674.40s]  Why would you take the boat? Oh, you let yourself open. Oh, no. Oh, don't no
[12675.12s -> 12677.12s]  He's playing like me
[12678.08s -> 12680.16s]  A little foolishly and ghoulishly you're correct
[12681.12s -> 12685.91s]  We're fine for it, but the problem is you have one card
[12686.47s -> 12693.27s]  And connor has my biggest concern is invading and then somehow misaligning the invasion to where there's just a whole
[12693.67s -> 12701.14s]  Yeah, like those 15 troops you can't access interesting gonna get you guys banned from everybody's channel running. I like our odds here
[12701.22s -> 12712.72s]  What are you doing? Don't don't be fucking weirdo. I don't even know what I do. You'll you'll never find us
[12712.80s -> 12714.80s]  I've spread us all over the continent
[12715.22s -> 12718.34s]  It's gonna take one of you guys just has to go and do it in one shot
[12718.42s -> 12721.38s]  That's the only way it's gonna work. I think yeah, that's the only way
[12721.78s -> 12726.94s]  Oh bumper. I still can't believe what happened over there at fucking barbecue
[12735.68s -> 12744.98s]  Oh, yeah, you could edit that 15 there you gotta do it in one go. Uh, where'd I put everybody?
[12745.06s -> 12750.50s]  There we go. You'll never get me in one go. I actually agree. Did you troubleshoot that guy's discord?
[12750.66s -> 12755.86s]  I mean we tried we're fighting so hard too quickly. Yes, they took three. They took three three for one. Oh
[12756.82s -> 12761.70s]  The full camera just glitched 47. It's actually attacking me. The whole game doesn't want to see me win
[12762.42s -> 12763.70s]  No
[12763.70s -> 12770.53s]  They're rolling you right now charlie filter bay is gonna stand strong. They always do carrier aft
[12771.65s -> 12779.80s]  Seems like a good spot. Shit. Uh, he's not winning this turn. He can't there's no way there's no way not with filter bay
[12779.96s -> 12783.22s]  There's no way. Oh and he leaves five and landing for no reason
[12784.10s -> 12788.20s]  Because I don't know how this game works
[12788.20s -> 12791.32s]  Uh, there we go strategically avoiding filter bay
[12796.16s -> 12798.16s]  I can't even attack that one
[12799.84s -> 12810.92s]  Oh my god, he found his 47 troops. Oh my oh my god, dude
[12812.74s -> 12814.34s]  You're gonna regret this
[12814.34s -> 12820.63s]  There's a lot of people just spread out. You do have like five men per island. Oh my god, dude
[12820.63s -> 12822.92s]  What the heck happened?
[12822.92s -> 12828.36s]  Dude, I think you're the wrong discord. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god, dude
[12828.36s -> 12833.46s]  What the heck happened man filter bay's lost the lost the will jesus christ
[12834.66s -> 12836.66s]  They're so tired of fighting at this point
[12837.30s -> 12842.10s]  They have only known war way too many leadership. I'm not i'm not doing it again
[12842.10s -> 12846.98s]  I probably you live one more turn here charlie. Yep, and i'm gonna make the most of it
[12846.98s -> 12849.94s]  I got three troops and i'm getting the fuck out
[12850.18s -> 12856.63s]  But I think I can win this if you just snake around and wait till you get a car turned
[12856.63s -> 12860.05s]  And he might not be able to catch you. Yeah, I think that's the play. Yeah
[12863.75s -> 12875.94s]  He just has so many troops and they're all over they are you know what you're right well
[12877.14s -> 12881.46s]  Somebody said wrong discord, dude. Fuck it. Haha
[12881.70s -> 12883.70s]  Like the cringe face
[12886.10s -> 12892.80s]  I might shift things. I'm not pressing the button to do that again. So i'm just letting you know, I promise
[12893.44s -> 12896.96s]  It's done. No, I know you
[12897.04s -> 12899.52s]  Ludwig you were saying that because you're like he's that's gonna get him going
[12899.52s -> 12903.76s]  He's gonna press the sound word thing. I forgot to attack that one. No me
[12904.96s -> 12906.96s]  42 troops
[12907.52s -> 12909.75s]  It's not enough
[12909.75s -> 12912.63s]  A lot of guys there. He looks like it's enough charlie
[12913.27s -> 12918.09s]  Watch i've i've strategically positioned us on the optimal battlefield
[12919.73s -> 12926.10s]  You know what? I think he didn't do enough here. I think industrial cargo lives 18 is not enough
[12928.02s -> 12930.02s]  This game is so
[12932.66s -> 12934.66s]  How do you how did he make it
[12935.22s -> 12939.86s]  Cargo he they live. All right, dude. I got into your call. Like what are you talking about?
[12940.74s -> 12947.14s]  How are you supposed to possibly do that? Oh you fool you'll never beat us here another mistake
[12947.62s -> 12955.49s]  Charlie just anyway on the disposal cargo. All right. I need these guys to die. Oh my god
[12955.81s -> 12961.59s]  Wait, this is so dumb. Why can I move them charlie charlie? You could make it to a car turn
[12962.47s -> 12967.70s]  I'm so close to it. All right. Oh, he's figured out how to fortify
[12968.76s -> 12970.76s]  No, wait, that's it. I can't move over
[12973.52s -> 12974.96s]  We're making a run for it
[12975.04s -> 12981.36s]  I'm gonna try and take refuge in the middle of this embarrassing joke. Uh arc here somebody's goes
[12981.44s -> 12985.92s]  Hey, dude, you playing stanley parable. Uh deluxe your boys are lacking resolve. Yeah

[13027.41s -> 13032.79s]  Underestimating connor. It's okay. Oh you think disposal cargo with anything less than 50
[13033.35s -> 13037.35s]  I believe listen, there's a lot of resolve on this on the blue side
[13038.15s -> 13042.23s]  Oh kristen edie lives. Oh, it's one and done every time
[13042.63s -> 13044.90s]  Oh

[13170.31s -> 13173.99s]  We do i'm not high. I'm not i don't get high on stream. I haven't got high on stream in like a year and a half
[13175.64s -> 13179.83s]  We okay, we do dos right now
[13180.39s -> 13185.84s]  For like a couple hours two three hours or we come back tomorrow
[13186.40s -> 13188.80s]  Do dos tomorrow at a normal time?
[13190.23s -> 13202.77s]  Everything we get a poll
[13202.77s -> 13205.17s]  I will be playing dos longer tomorrow
[13205.89s -> 13209.67s]  Or we can go hard tonight and I stream till like one or two o'clock in the morning
[13212.68s -> 13217.81s]  But that then that means there is no stream tomorrow if I stream to like two three a.m pacific
[13217.81s -> 13222.37s]  I'm probably i'm not going to stream tomorrow tomorrow. Is it better?
[13222.93s -> 13229.51s]  I've seen a lot of tomorrows do both
[13238.66s -> 13244.18s]  Normal time by the way would be four o'clock pacific. That was fun, though
[13246.80s -> 13250.48s]  I'm really enjoying the kind of just jump in a game with a bunch of just buds
[13255.89s -> 13265.01s]  Conor rating a fellow ally is the right and i'm probably about to send you somewhere else
[13267.16s -> 13276.13s]  You're all about to go somewhere else because we're uh, the poll looks like it's unanimous that tomorrow is when i'm gonna stream
[13279.81s -> 13288.58s]  Is uh is charlie still streaming? Yeah, we'll do tomorrow. We'll start. What does do tomorrow four o'clock?
[13288.74s -> 13295.78s]  We'll do some dos
[13295.78s -> 13299.62s]  Yeah, it's probably better. Anyways, instead of like keeping everybody up till like two o'clock in the morning
[13299.62s -> 13304.39s]  We'll just start tomorrow at four pacific. Yeah, that's better. That's the plan
[13307.12s -> 13312.07s]  Uh, yeah, well, thanks the raid conor. Uh, obviously a lot of fun to play with you as always
[13313.00s -> 13315.00s]  So i'll just send you guys immediately here
[13315.38s -> 13332.18s]  Uh to is ludwig still streaming too. We'll see you off for the night charlie's still on. All right

[13337.41s -> 13346.71s]  Thanks for watching. See you tomorrow. Good night. Goodbye. That was risk
[13347.48s -> 13348.44s]  I didn't play dos
[13348.44s -> 13357.68s]  It has been what says that in the uh tweet and potentially even in the title if ludwig's still streaming then some of you run over
[13357.68s -> 13361.70s]  There I will I will officially be slash rating
[13361.86s -> 13370.40s]  Uh charlie very very fun didn't win but you know, hey, okay
[13370.48s -> 13374.56s]  I did. Okay, I think it's more about the journey than it is about the destination. Come on
[13386.05s -> 13388.05s]  I got a lot of dos games a lot
[13391.86s -> 13394.10s]  One would say too many so it's actually kind of good
[13397.33s -> 13400.29s]  It's good that we're not doing this tonight because I might stay up till like 3 a.m
[13405.59s -> 13412.62s]  All right. I'll see you guys later. Good night. Goodbye. Take care of yourselves. See you tomorrow
