[1.02s -> 7.43s]  What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? Wow, German985 is playing my favorite game,
[7.43s -> 15.43s]  Watch Dogs Allegiance. Oh, I can't believe it's out now. It's only $59.99, $99.99, or $119. Why was
[15.43s -> 29.40s]  there? What's $119? I don't understand. Is this a $120 edition of this game? What do you get?
[30.36s -> 51.67s]  Hold on, I gotta move my mic. It's low from the auto stream. What do you get with a $120 edition?
[53.19s -> 60.62s]  A little figurine that's made out of plywood? What do you get? Tell me. Remember your $1080 is
[60.62s -> 67.35s]  not going to be powerful enough. No, it is. I'm good. I can turn the graphics down if I have to.
[67.99s -> 83.91s]  It's for skins? Oh, I'm going to be fine. $1080 is fine. Yeah, that's fine. We had 10 community subs
[83.91s -> 94.47s]  from Aggression Cow. Thank you, Aggression Cow, for the 10 community subs. $1080 Andy. That's me.
[95.45s -> 107.48s]  I just used the $1080. That's what I do. Make sure you're on DX11. Oh, I just opened the game.
[107.48s -> 116.25s]  Is that? I don't think I even have DX12. I think I'm going to be fine. So yeah, this is Watch Dogs
[116.25s -> 124.92s]  Legion. I know it's shocking. I know a lot of you guys are just choking on your grapes or whatever
[124.92s -> 133.58s]  you're eating right now. Yes, I'm playing a game that came out today. A new game that came out today.
[134.74s -> 144.71s]  Weird. That shit don't happen. Why am I playing this? Well, go over the German 985 checklist,
[144.71s -> 153.27s]  please. Okay. Punch people on sidewalk. That's a box that's checked. Drive a car. That's a box
[153.27s -> 162.42s]  that's checked. Open world. That's a box that's checked. And I can play as old people. That's a
[162.42s -> 167.70s]  bonus secret menu that you didn't even know about. That box is now checked. And I know, look, I'm
[167.70s -> 171.14s]  already going to give you my impression of this game. I haven't played it, but I feel like this
[171.14s -> 177.61s]  is just going to be when I used to play GTA 4 with the pedestrian mod that you could play as
[177.61s -> 187.45s]  any pedestrian. I feel like it's going to be the same game. I'm going in with an open mind though.
[192.23s -> 197.75s]  He's going through his daily checklist. It's just a shitty version of that. No, it's the GTA 4
[197.75s -> 207.37s]  pedestrian mod, but somebody modded in phones like hacking phones. And it looks beautiful on a GTX
[207.37s -> 221.53s]  1080, I'll tell you. That's a sponsor. It's not a sponsor. All right, let's just go. I'm going to
[221.53s -> 226.39s]  stall. I don't have to put a VR headset on. We can just go. There's also something interesting
[226.39s -> 234.57s]  this game has, which, why don't we take a look? This game has permadeath, and I'm assuming that
[234.57s -> 244.74s]  you can have a bunch of people that are playing in your group, and if they die, they're dead forever.
[244.74s -> 254.55s]  I'm going to put, why not? My justification of playing on normal is to have permadeath on.
[254.55s -> 260.41s]  I'm not playing on hard. No, we're playing normal with permadeath. That's your, that's the
[260.41s -> 273.51s]  compromise here. Please play the game, Mr. Streamer Man. I am. Are you ready? Are you guys ready for
[273.51s -> 281.54s]  Watch Dogs Legion? It's gonna be a 10 minute stream. Why, you think I'm gonna not like the
[281.54s -> 289.91s]  game that much? Why do I look like, I sound like, I look loud. Am I, am I really loud?
[291.86s -> 304.79s]  I look very loud. No? I look loud. All right, let's go. Do you want to start the game with
[304.79s -> 310.02s]  these settings? Permadeath is on. Permadeath mode can be turned off in the options. Yeah, I'm good.
[310.02s -> 319.24s]  Let's go. Hacking computers. Files. I'm checking, I'm checking on it. I'm checking on it. Yeah,
[319.24s -> 323.37s]  just give me a minute. I'm checking on it. Yeah, what these people don't know is it takes like
[323.37s -> 328.23s]  three months to hack into like some bank account. Oh, you want to get into bank account? Yeah,
[328.23s -> 335.02s]  let me check on that right now. I got it. Pre-recorded hacking sequences.
[348.55s -> 355.69s]  All that music, art and multiculturalism and the world's oldest underground, the tube,
[355.69s -> 363.61s]  the class of cities really top shelf stuff. Raving rabbits. To tear it all down.
[364.81s -> 370.98s]  Wait, did it say it was 12, London's 12,000 years old? How is that possible when the earth is only
[370.98s -> 390.31s]  like 3000 years old? What, what are you talking, what do you mean? A light bulb just went like
[391.70s -> 398.98s]  and broke in my head. Wait, what? Ow. Thoughts. Ow. Critical thinking hurts.
[401.14s -> 421.37s]  Is that me? Oh, cool. All right. Ubisoft presents not raving rabbits. Resident sleeper. I'm in.
[422.01s -> 424.89s]  I'm in. I told you. I'm in. Me too.
[431.13s -> 435.05s]  That's rich, Bagley. The government would sooner arrest us for trying to help,
[435.05s -> 439.37s]  but actually do something useful. This one on our own. Carefully, Dalton.
[440.09s -> 443.93s]  Actually, are you detecting a little worry in Sabine's voice? Brilliant. Asking the
[443.93s -> 450.49s]  computer about feelings. This explains so much. Shut it, you two, and get to work. There she is.
[452.41s -> 456.49s]  This game is going to suck. Well, you can't say that yet. We haven't even walked around.
[456.49s -> 463.75s]  Let's check that 1080. Okay. Hey, guys, 1080 seems to be holding up pretty well.
[464.55s -> 474.26s]  C to crouch. Okay. Press F near an unaware enemy to perform a takedown. If I hit Q,
[475.22s -> 484.07s]  I vibrate his phone and I can punch him right in the fucking face. Nice. That'll definitely
[484.07s -> 488.23s]  hurt your hand. Your hand probably broke in four places. I hate that bullshit. It's so stupid. If
[488.23s -> 493.43s]  you punch somebody in the face, your hand breaks. Why doesn't it cut to this guy in a fucking
[493.43s -> 502.28s]  hospital bed for a week? Investigate the threat to parliament. That's a weak hand.
[503.72s -> 513.54s]  If they don't shoot me, I won't shoot them. How's that? Weak bones? All right. Operation
[513.54s -> 522.30s]  Westminster. Okay, that's vault. Is there a hitman thing where I can see through walls?
[523.26s -> 527.53s]  Isn't it permadeath on? If I die with the main characters, does the game just end?
[532.17s -> 539.82s]  Detective vision. Wait, sneak. Hold on a locked door to reveal the link to the closed circuit
[539.82s -> 547.93s]  terminal to unlock the door. All right, be careful. There's people over here. Okay. Oh,
[547.93s -> 559.42s]  just like in Half-Life. Hijack. Use to hijack camera and scout the area. Hijack. Nice. Cool.
[559.42s -> 569.93s]  Press Q when aiming at an explosive device to use the arm trap hack. Okay, that's been armed. What
[569.93s -> 581.70s]  is it? Wait, no. Arm this one. Wait, what? It didn't say explode. It just said arm. It's really
[581.70s -> 589.46s]  cool to see that they still think this mechanic is cool like eight years later. Okay, let's go.
[596.63s -> 600.15s]  Wait, no, don't walk over there. This is going to explode if I go over there. It's permadeath. I
[600.15s -> 611.13s]  can't die. All right, sneak. Wait, arm trap. Now when he walks into that, he's going to explode.
[611.13s -> 627.50s]  Is he? Why is all this stuff so dangerous? Why? Why is every single thing we have
[627.50s -> 636.94s]  surrounding us able to explode? Wait, wait, wait. There's two people here. All right, arm this.
[636.94s -> 641.82s]  Watch. Hey, guys, watch this. I'm a hacker. I'm going to make the soda machine explode when the
[641.82s -> 665.06s]  guy walks towards it. Am I not? I mean, what are you doing? Deadsec as fuck. All right, turn off the
[665.06s -> 668.74s]  power. We've got loads of Deadsec gear down here. And why don't you suppose that is?
[669.38s -> 674.94s]  What? How did they get their hands on it? I don't know. Oh, hack. Or someone wants to make it look
[674.94s -> 682.70s]  like Deadsec was here. Shit. What happened? Oh. All right, they think. Oh, I got, by the way,
[682.70s -> 687.98s]  one really important thing about this story. I don't care. I never did care. I don't give a shit
[687.98s -> 691.82s]  about anything they're talking about. I played an hour of Watch Dogs 1 and like two hours of
[691.82s -> 694.38s]  Watch Dogs 2. I don't care about anything they're saying. I have no idea what's happening.
[694.86s -> 707.38s]  Is that bad that I just played for like three hours total? Is that bad? Does it matter? Oh,
[707.38s -> 717.48s]  wait. It's OK. I'll get a TLDR. What happens? I only played Watch Dogs enough to like drive
[717.48s -> 722.28s]  over somebody on the sidewalk, hack a traffic light and have a car crash happen. And then I went,
[722.28s -> 731.19s]  yeah, I stopped playing. Distract. Wait, where's there a fuck me? The entire place is rigged to
[731.19s -> 746.07s]  blow. It is? It covered near a wall. I got one right here. AI doesn't swear.
[748.23s -> 759.30s]  Why would you program AI to swear? All right, we got to reach the House of Commons. I'm just
[759.30s -> 764.76s]  going to walk around. Oh, fuck. What do I do? I got to distract this guy. All right. Distract.
[766.62s -> 777.86s]  What? I don't have enough power to hack. OK, I have enough power to go into a webcam and look
[777.86s -> 780.90s]  at somebody, but not enough to like hack their phone. All right, I get it. Let's just walk.
[782.02s -> 790.01s]  You're out of hacking mana. The AI is probably stupid. It's stupid. Look.
[790.01s -> 813.24s]  Look. I'm good. This guy's chasing you like a baton. Unavailable under pursuit? What? I'm
[813.24s -> 832.34s]  good. I'm just hiding in the trash. They can't see me. Unavailable. Where's my? All right, so go.
[832.34s -> 839.70s]  Move on. Yeah, I know. The 100 foot radius in a circle around you is clear. You might
[839.70s -> 849.90s]  want to check somewhere else. Oh, no, I know what they're doing. They will. Oh, OK. No, I'm good.
[849.90s -> 854.46s]  It's all right. I just screamed. They were just pretending to check and going over the microphone
[854.46s -> 863.38s]  over the radio like tell the supervisor like, yeah, it was just make believe. Oh, what do I do?
[864.90s -> 872.31s]  Looks I'm going to have to hack into this. Oh, come on. What about hacking? Why can I hack the
[872.31s -> 886.34s]  door? This guy dies in the House of Commons in like five minutes. Whoever these men in black
[886.34s -> 890.90s]  are, they've got blast bollocks to set up in the center of government. I get it. I know. I know.
[890.90s -> 893.86s]  I'm going to die in like two minutes. And that's what it's like. Oh, you think this is the main
[893.86s -> 898.06s]  character would have been like kind of a cool reveal if they just didn't spend the last like
[898.06s -> 902.66s]  full year talking about how cool it was to play as every character in the world.
[902.66s -> 914.66s]  All right. Reach the detonator. All right. Well, that was unnecessary, but it's OK.
[915.22s -> 926.97s]  This is a minigame. What do I have to do? Oh, it's a cut scene. And it's definitely live.
[926.97s -> 931.05s]  Bagley, I'm going to need some help with this. Yes, you are. But sadly, I'm locked out.
[931.05s -> 940.74s]  Well, we don't have a chance. Bagley. Wait, wait. His name is Bagley. You're full of surprises.
[942.87s -> 953.90s]  Be quick about it. Not like in portal. I mean, oh, yeah, me too. Bombs have just armed themselves.
[953.90s -> 958.06s]  Well, that may complicate matters. All right. Hey, those of you that are playing
[958.06s -> 964.38s]  the drinking game, that's three times vaporizing. So fair warning. Expect this to draw some attention
[964.38s -> 973.93s]  your way, Dalton. Oh, I'm cancer. Company at our back door. Dalton, we've got some heat here.
[973.93s -> 978.09s]  Emma, why? What? How long is this going to take Bagley? Depends how often you interrupt me with
[978.09s -> 984.81s]  questions. All right, everyone faces on guns out faces on. Oh, I can't wait to put I'm going to
[984.81s -> 997.13s]  pick my favorite mask. All right. I can pick a mask. No, no, no. You're not supposed to save me.
[998.09s -> 1009.98s]  You're supposed to save her. They're on me. I'll try and hold them off.
[1009.98s -> 1019.66s]  Okay. Survive the ambush. Oh, shit. Oh, sorry. I didn't do it. Am I supposed to kill these guys?
[1040.71s -> 1054.54s]  Okay. So I have to what do I do? Okay. Um, it's still on. This is slow mo effect.
[1056.09s -> 1069.08s]  Well, this is a really long slow mo. Turn off the computer. I have to do this. This sucks. Why? What
[1069.08s -> 1091.99s]  the hell happened? Press Control Alt Delete. Oh, I'm it. I'm it. Oh, I got booted. I got booted.
[1091.99s -> 1101.77s]  I can't believe I have to control. I have to put hard reset this. Watch Dogs Legion end task.
[1101.77s -> 1115.00s]  Give me a fucking break. Where's that going to pop up? Where's that? What's that going to do?
[1115.00s -> 1118.92s]  Watch Dogs Legion. All right, let's go. That better be an auto save right there.
[1126.57s -> 1143.08s]  This is so stupid. Oh, well. Now I can't even open the game. Is it opening? Hello? It says the
[1143.08s -> 1165.48s]  game is running. I ended the task. You just got bogged. What is going on? Open. 10 minute stream.
[1165.48s -> 1170.20s]  No, no, it's opening. It's just taking a wicked long time. I have all the new driver. I need a
[1170.20s -> 1183.42s]  computer. I can't like pretend to play these new AAA games. All right. It only took two minutes
[1183.42s -> 1189.98s]  to open. This is what it felt like when you used to have a regular HDD and you turn on windows and
[1189.98s -> 1194.92s]  it would take like seven minutes before you got to your desktop. Fuck. I need a new computer.
[1194.92s -> 1207.61s]  All right. Here we go. Big bits. Oh shit. There are big bits. All right. This is from tapeworm
[1207.61s -> 1216.76s]  corn dog. Holy shit. That's disgusting. Thanks for the that's a hundred bucks. 10,000 bits from
[1216.76s -> 1222.42s]  tapeworm corn dog. And they say, thanks for fucking showing everybody my cool username.
[1222.42s -> 1228.86s]  Actually, that's not even my username. My username is Royale coming my way. I don't know.
[1231.80s -> 1235.56s]  Anyways, they say, hi Jerma. Love you and chat. Been watching for like eight years and today's
[1235.56s -> 1239.40s]  my 19th birthday. Happy fucking birthday. Wanted to give it a little back and say thanks for being
[1239.40s -> 1245.80s]  the master of comedy. I won't be here for long because I exclusively watch VODs. All right. Also,
[1245.80s -> 1257.82s]  can we get some Jerma disgusts for my username? Yeah, I gave you a huge one. Oh fuck. I completely
[1258.46s -> 1263.83s]  blew my cover here. I turned it on for a minute to make sure that the 1080 could handle it.
[1268.49s -> 1273.90s]  Here we are. No, seriously, tapeworm. That's a ton of money. Thanks for the fucking hundred bucks.
[1278.36s -> 1283.00s]  It still couldn't handle it. I swear to God, if it crashes again, I'm going to be very upset.
[1283.00s -> 1293.14s]  But the game didn't even crash. We still get an audio. Oh, lower this. All right. I'm going to
[1293.14s -> 1299.37s]  lower the settings. That's not a bad idea. Lower the graphics settings. Oh, great. And I get to be
[1299.37s -> 1309.37s]  the last person that loads up in League. Everyone has to sit there and fucking watch. Like, holy shit.
[1309.37s -> 1319.96s]  Oh my God. Don't even fucking tell me. What a town. History around every corner. God damn it. All
[1319.96s -> 1327.21s]  right. Hold on. Turn the graphics down. Video. All right. Yeah. FPS limit. Field of view. I can't
[1327.21s -> 1335.46s]  turn that up. Quality. All right. Graphics quality. High. Geometry. High. Environment. High. Texture
[1335.54s -> 1342.10s]  medium. Filtering. You can't even tell a difference. OK. Look it. This is like going
[1342.10s -> 1347.38s]  to the eye doctor and you have no idea which one looks better. It doesn't even matter.
[1348.10s -> 1355.06s]  Low. Shadows. OK. These actually look better. No, they don't. Those look terrible. It looks like
[1355.06s -> 1366.31s]  there's a giant spiderweb over New York. Oh, London. Wherever we are. Headlight shadow. Reflections.
[1366.31s -> 1375.02s]  But somebody point out the difference. Turn them off. Who cares? Motion blur. Get out of here.
[1375.02s -> 1379.66s]  Depth of field. Get out of here. Ambient occlusion. Nobody wants that. Everyone turns it
[1379.66s -> 1384.12s]  off. That's the first thing everybody does when they open up any video game. They turn this off.
[1384.12s -> 1392.42s]  Uh, subsurface scattering. I feel like this is just a made up word that they can just have
[1392.42s -> 1398.60s]  a toggle here. What is it doing? It's scattering the subsurface? It looks all right. I guess it
[1398.60s -> 1407.70s]  looks OK. Ray Tracer. I don't have that. I can't do that. Temporal upscaling. All right. I'm good.
[1407.78s -> 1426.89s]  Let's go. Dude. Oh, you know, playing a game at launch. Launch bugs. Launch like problems.
[1426.89s -> 1435.02s]  It's OK. Whatever, man. This is what happens. Playing at launch. By the way, it is refreshing.
[1435.02s -> 1446.15s]  It's just taking a while. Veto it. No, I can't. Are we serious? No, not yet. Go play 3DS. I'm not
[1446.15s -> 1459.50s]  playing 3DS. I have to play one AAA game a year. I'm allowed to. OK, here we go. I'm in. Veto.
[1459.50s -> 1465.22s]  I'm not vetoing. Let's go. We're here. I have. I've lowered the graphics. I'm ready. I'm just
[1465.22s -> 1468.42s]  going to speed run this part. I'm running. I'm just going to run through this part because I
[1468.42s -> 1475.30s]  don't care. You're not vetoing. We are. Yeah, but don't you understand? I have like I have the
[1475.30s -> 1484.01s]  voting power of like a million of you. I just say we're going and that's what we do. That's a
[1484.01s -> 1500.92s]  dictator. I mean, aren't all streams like dictatorships? No, yes. You're a tyrant.
[1501.56s -> 1513.19s]  OK, here we go. Welcome to Watch Dogs. I'm your host, Jerma. And thank you. And thank you to
[1513.19s -> 1528.31s]  Ubisoft for making such a cool game. And thank you. Big thanks. Thank you. No, no, this is not
[1528.31s -> 1539.69s]  sponsored. I just said thank you for making a cool game. Go. All right, I'm in. I'm in. I'm in. I'm
[1539.69s -> 1546.71s]  in. Let's go. For real, I'm in. It's time to move. Go. Speed run. I'm not stopping for anything.
[1549.58s -> 1557.99s]  Wait, why did I just Medusa that guy? What happened? If they don't shoot me, I won't shoot them.
[1557.99s -> 1571.02s]  How's that? I just think spit in that guy's face. Let's go. Oh, look, I don't know. What do I do?
[1579.27s -> 1583.43s]  That hurt you more than it hurt me. I feel like I just had a football in my hand.
[1586.04s -> 1602.50s]  What the fuck was that Metal Gear Solid bullshit? Good. Turn it on. I've got loads of dead set gear
[1602.50s -> 1609.06s]  down here. I don't care. Leave me alone. Who are these men in black anyway? Nothing identifying.
[1609.06s -> 1633.48s]  I suspect that's by design. Disrupt. All right, we're good. We're on pace. Okay.
[1637.46s -> 1638.82s]  The entire place is rigged to blow.
[1643.08s -> 1648.60s]  RDX nitrogen. Enough to level parliament. Analyze. Wait, I didn't do this last time. Let me do this
[1648.60s -> 1652.84s]  first. But there's a device streaming a fuck load of encrypted data from the floor above you.
[1652.84s -> 1658.44s]  Fuck. Yeah, that fits the bill on my way. Is that not the detonator? No, but it's a transmitter
[1658.44s -> 1662.84s]  sending a signal to a device on the floor above us. Safe to assume that would be the detonator
[1662.84s -> 1671.16s]  we're looking for. Stage dead set propaganda all around the bombs. This is not how you're
[1671.16s -> 1674.92s]  supposed to play. This is going to blow up parliament and hang it on us. Not if you get
[1674.92s -> 1693.75s]  to that detonator first. Did you see me? What? No, don't him. Okay, we're good. I did it. It only took
[1693.75s -> 1705.27s]  me three seconds. He should have tried to open it, picked up his phone, held it over to it,
[1705.27s -> 1708.31s]  and it didn't work. And he should have looked right at the camera and gone like, oh, man.
[1710.42s -> 1724.25s]  Yep. Okay, here we go. Save the game. I can't. It's just it's permanently auto saving. All right,
[1724.25s -> 1731.06s]  I'm going to arm a trap. Let's make sure this doesn't hurt us. Arm trap. Interact. Here we go.
[1731.06s -> 1740.04s]  It's time to shoot. Headshot. Don't. I'm not going to shoot the guy the same way. All right,
[1740.04s -> 1760.73s]  here we go. Ready? All right, your way out. Let's go. Why is the guy screaming?
[1765.94s -> 1797.67s]  We're good. Three. That's three. Three. Oh, X. Oh, you can. Look at this. 53%. Flashbang.
[1798.63s -> 1805.88s]  Flashbang. How do I throw it? Oh, I think it's a recharge.
[1807.64s -> 1823.30s]  Why do I feel like I'm playing Left 4 Dead right now? This is payday. Get on. Get on? What?
[1825.30s -> 1835.37s]  No crash. We're good. Deactivate. Sick.
[1835.85s -> 1839.29s]  On the left, one of them is the receiver. You need to pull the controller wire.
[1839.93s -> 1847.40s]  Are you fucking kidding me? No, I'm fucking not. No fucking. Fuck. Which one is this? Fuck. Now,
[1847.40s -> 1851.24s]  don't. Dalton, don't. Fuck. Don't pull that one. Oh, fuck.
[1858.30s -> 1864.10s]  See, that wasn't so bad, was it? Why'd they all mask up? They didn't even go anywhere.
[1865.30s -> 1872.01s]  What was that for? Everybody mask up. We're just gonna stay here. Well, what the fuck am I looking
[1872.01s -> 1876.81s]  at?
[1893.70s -> 1894.50s]  Should I go get a bomb?
[1894.50s -> 1905.96s]  Oh, they knew where our hideout was. It was a mall.
[1908.52s -> 1918.95s]  Fuck. It was a mall. It was probably me. To the roof. Wait, pick up ammo?
[1925.29s -> 1928.49s]  We're being raided? Oh, well, Sabine, sing the raid song.
[1930.17s -> 1937.99s]  I need him for the transmit. Let's press V to scan the area and reveal cameras to hack.
[1939.51s -> 1945.35s]  Okay, I'll do it the old-fashioned way. Wipe him. Yes, wipe me. Do it, Sabine,
[1945.35s -> 1949.03s]  and get the hell out of there. Okay. Fuck. Hack. Download that. Whatever it is.
[1949.75s -> 1959.02s]  Okay. Hack, he's down. You're on your own. Hack, whatever this is, too. What is this?
[1959.90s -> 1970.42s]  What are we doing? I promise. Okay. Am I in somebody's iPad? Or did I get it?
[1971.30s -> 1981.08s]  I got the code, right? Yeah, I downloaded the code. Hey, hey! What happened? I didn't do
[1981.08s -> 1993.13s]  anything. No, no, no. Get down. All right, you stun him and then you shoot him in the head.
[1994.41s -> 2001.85s]  Why is that person... That person's like super... What was it? Marshall in World of Warcraft
[2002.57s -> 2007.06s]  battleground arena thing? I tried. I forgot what it was. I'm sorry.
[2009.46s -> 2016.25s]  Why can I not shoot him? Why is that guy so special?
[2016.97s -> 2038.54s]  Why was that guy special? E, toxicity for encroaching 500 percent. Where are you?
[2039.10s -> 2057.13s]  Come on. Defuse. What are all these bombs look like underneath your sink?
[2057.77s -> 2082.54s]  Have you ever noticed that? Like plumbing in there. There's not even wires. Who is it?
[2083.02s -> 2087.45s]  What the fuck are you? Oh, you still think you're here to save London?
[2088.09s -> 2093.21s]  I'm afraid that's not going to happen. You're here to help us with some important work.
[2093.21s -> 2096.41s]  Important work? Fire! Oh, drones!
[2097.61s -> 2105.29s]  Exactly. To save the world. You do know Londoners have died before. The plague,
[2105.29s -> 2111.21s]  the great fire, the blitz. There's not much fun. But destruction is always the cure.
[2111.85s -> 2117.85s]  And it begins today. Zero day. Did anybody else see this? Did anybody else see this big
[2117.85s -> 2124.17s]  projection of Obi-Wan talking? This is like the Emperor. This is like a 10 million decibel
[2124.17s -> 2137.96s]  megawatt speaker. It's time for a hard reset. Oh my god. No! Told you he was dead.
[2137.96s -> 2151.67s]  A series of explosions devastated three sites in London. Authorities are asking residents to remain
[2151.67s -> 2158.07s]  in their homes as the situation continues to develop. I loved that character. I loved that
[2158.07s -> 2163.51s]  character. Warners gathered for a series of candle-like vigils that brought closure to
[2163.51s -> 2167.75s]  thousands of families and indeed to an entire city. You didn't have a chance.
[2167.75s -> 2173.51s]  London is now laser focused. They attend Downing Street where Nigel Cass, CEO of
[2173.51s -> 2178.95s]  private military company Albion, received a mandate to secure London. Cass has vowed to
[2178.95s -> 2184.31s]  hunt down DedSec. I don't know what's going on. I probably should have played the first two games.
[2199.43s -> 2205.51s]  That's not like John Oliver? Oh wait. No, it wouldn't be John Oliver. He didn't go,
[2205.51s -> 2209.91s]  I don't think I say that Mr Turfill. I don't want you to do it and I don't think that you're very smart.
[2237.90s -> 2245.90s]  So where do we come in here?
[2258.70s -> 2262.06s]  What is DedSec bad or is DedSec good?
[2262.46s -> 2273.42s]  Willing to expound those theories on camera. Hey attention, were you a follower?
[2278.95s -> 2289.80s]  I'm falling for fake news. Wait, but the TV told me that DedSec was not very good.
[2291.72s -> 2303.74s]  Oh shit, the fake news is working on me. Who am I? Am I the spider?
[2304.30s -> 2311.78s]  Waters and we've been discussing the hacktivist now alleged terrorist group DedSec on this week's
[2311.78s -> 2318.50s]  Buccaneer radio. I have Colin calling in. Colin what's your take? Now I'll be the same to start.
[2318.50s -> 2325.08s]  We should have round up DedSec and thrown them in jail. Now I say they should all be locked up.
[2325.08s -> 2330.81s]  Find it awfully convenient that they've been fingered as the attackers but we've seen no proof.
[2330.81s -> 2337.90s]  Say the line. I'd say you have to look at their history of non-violent action.
[2337.90s -> 2340.30s]  I thought they just said up there, blame the data center.
[2340.30s -> 2345.34s]  The hospital in the past few months and DedSec ever has. I smell a scapegoat.
[2345.34s -> 2349.05s]  Now what do we do? How do I shoot lasers?
[2349.05s -> 2354.02s]  You're absolutely right Claire. The government's just framing DedSec because they want to make
[2354.02s -> 2362.84s]  it seem like they have no clue who was behind the bombings. Put that on their side.
[2362.84s -> 2368.09s]  Who better to depend on? Angie, I have you next. What do you make of all this?
[2370.49s -> 2372.17s]  I like swallow the last word.
[2372.17s -> 2380.07s]  I couldn't even go into the, because I was swallowing.
[2380.07s -> 2401.03s]  Do you feel safe for using a pseudonym? Everyone should. Why make it easier for them to track you?
[2401.03s -> 2403.27s]  And now we've seen what they're capable of.
[2403.27s -> 2403.99s]  What am I doing?
[2405.75s -> 2411.27s]  Hold on. Do you mean the government? Are you suggesting the government was responsible for
[2411.27s -> 2412.23s]  the bombings?
[2412.23s -> 2431.72s]  Fuck. How is it doing that? Why is it just doing that? It's crashed again. Why is it crashing?
[2435.22s -> 2438.90s]  No, I haven't even been able to get into, I need to get into a car first.
[2438.90s -> 2443.54s]  You don't veto an open world car game without driving the car first.
[2443.54s -> 2455.30s]  What if I take down a little bit more graphic quality? Put it on medium.
[2457.46s -> 2461.54s]  You drove the car. That's not a car. That was an animal.
[2461.54s -> 2467.18s]  Did you update your drivers? I did like a week ago.
[2467.82s -> 2471.90s]  What is there like a Watch Dogs Legion launch drivers?
[2472.06s -> 2482.02s]  That better not be. Man, that always is.
[2482.02s -> 2485.54s]  That better not be. I have a 1080. They don't even make drivers for me anymore.
[2485.54s -> 2489.90s]  They don't care about me. They don't want to make drivers for me
[2489.90s -> 2493.18s]  because they don't want me to have a, they want me to get the new one.
[2493.18s -> 2499.70s]  All right. If it crashes again, I'm going to update my drivers.
[2499.70s -> 2513.42s]  What does it say? The crashes that some players are experiencing are due to Windows problems?
[2513.42s -> 2515.26s]  It's caused by outdated Windows.
[2516.49s -> 2520.66s]  What? What would that have to fucking do with anything?
[2520.66s -> 2529.46s]  Dude, is he still alive in this playthrough? He better not be.
[2537.48s -> 2548.55s]  Windows user detected. Hold on.
[2548.55s -> 2558.25s]  You see it? If I swear to God off this guy, play a silly game.
[2558.25s -> 2561.74s]  What is silly game? What does that even mean? Silly game.
[2563.54s -> 2565.38s]  This is a silly game.
[2565.38s -> 2573.26s]  Crashes are due to outdated. Guys, I did a full fresh install of Windows 10
[2573.26s -> 2575.42s]  like two weeks ago, three weeks ago.
[2575.42s -> 2578.78s]  This is all brand new operating system as of like two weeks ago.
[2579.67s -> 2581.43s]  All fresh, complete updates.
[2581.51s -> 2585.91s]  I need to assemble a team, but I can't reboot DedSec alone.
[2585.91s -> 2589.27s]  What's going on? Let me break into London CTOS and see
[2589.27s -> 2591.51s]  who's available. Did I skip a whole thing?
[2595.48s -> 2598.52s]  Oh, okay. Go, go, go, go, go. All right. Get in there.
[2598.52s -> 2602.84s]  Alleged terrorist group, DedSec on this week's Buccaneer Radio.
[2602.84s -> 2608.18s]  What's your take? We've been saying from the start
[2608.18s -> 2611.85s]  we should have ran up DedSec and thrown him in jail.
[2611.85s -> 2616.25s]  What were your graphic settings again? You don't find it awfully convenient.
[2616.25s -> 2618.25s]  I don't even want to listen to that. I already know.
[2619.82s -> 2622.94s]  I can't even, I can't hit escape. We have to do this first.
[2627.30s -> 2630.42s]  Say the line. What would it be doing?
[2630.42s -> 2639.51s]  Outdated Windows. Why do I feel like that's like weird corporate speak
[2639.51s -> 2642.07s]  for holy shit, let's get a day two patch out.
[2644.28s -> 2647.40s]  All right, Windows may be outdated, I think.
[2656.63s -> 2660.31s]  Check to see if your monitor is plugged in.
[2661.11s -> 2663.51s]  Get the patch, get the fucking patch ready by tomorrow, motherfucker.
[2663.83s -> 2667.75s]  Check to see if your cable, if you plugged in your cable recently,
[2667.75s -> 2668.63s]  like your power cable.
[2675.18s -> 2682.28s]  Access the CTOS data clusters. Reinstall Windows again.
[2687.03s -> 2689.43s]  What's the graphics card recommended graphics card for this?
[2690.07s -> 2706.01s]  It's probably like a 780, 1070. All right, sick. Hack it.
[2708.44s -> 2711.93s]  I hacked. I don't know.
[2711.93s -> 2722.82s]  Is this a Green Goblin's Tower? What did I just do?
[2722.82s -> 2723.86s]  Searching for contacts.
[2724.97s -> 2727.37s]  Shit, situation is worse than I thought.
[2728.89s -> 2729.53s]  Are they all dead?
[2729.53s -> 2736.84s]  There's a candidate. Looks like your dead sex best hope.
[2736.84s -> 2738.36s]  Select your first operative.
[2746.79s -> 2751.19s]  6G data plan, fast downloads. Wait, hold on.
[2754.52s -> 2761.26s]  Animator has a crowbar. Wrench, heavy, melee weapon.
[2763.82s -> 2769.48s]  Really fast downloads. I think I like Lindsay Cullen.
[2769.48s -> 2771.16s]  Runs hacker forum on the dark web.
[2773.64s -> 2776.28s]  Yeah, so he runs a hacker forum on the dark web.
[2776.28s -> 2787.14s]  Therefore, he wears a bright purple LED vest and glasses that have emotes on them.
[2787.14s -> 2790.58s]  Nancy recently purchased a $200,000 sports car.
[2790.58s -> 2793.38s]  Personal sports vehicle. Oh shit, that's kind of cool.
[2798.15s -> 2804.63s]  Motorcycle. Okay, but I feel like everybody clicked this because it said internet celebrity.
[2807.56s -> 2810.66s]  Nancy Drew. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. We're not done.
[2811.56s -> 2812.84s]  It's podcaster. Ugh.
[2820.57s -> 2823.13s]  Grates fake coupons. Dancer.
[2823.85s -> 2826.95s]  That's okay. Oh wait, hold on.
[2826.95s -> 2831.78s]  What about the old guy that used to sell snake oil back in like the 1800s?
[2831.78s -> 2841.74s]  Has a private phone line to the police commissioner.
[2841.74s -> 2851.42s]  What? Wrote five star review of the Earl's Fortune Pub.
[2851.42s -> 2854.30s]  That's not really that big. That's not like a big thing.
[2855.18s -> 2856.14s]  That's not a big deal.
[2858.62s -> 2861.02s]  Has private phone line to the police commissioner.
[2861.02s -> 2863.77s]  Wrote a Yelp review once.
[2863.77s -> 2867.64s]  Why would you... I don't want... What?
[2867.64s -> 2872.95s]  Board game designer. I thought it was like he gets a free VR.
[2872.95s -> 2876.47s]  SV? Oh shit!
[2879.51s -> 2880.39s]  Salary. All right.
[2881.45s -> 2891.32s]  I mean, I think it's going to be Nancy. Nancy, the sports car.
[2891.32s -> 2892.52s]  Wait, we didn't see the end.
[2893.38s -> 2895.38s]  Oh, this guy's a smuggler.
[2897.16s -> 2900.52s]  No. No. I'm Nancy.
[2900.52s -> 2905.34s]  Nancy Schramm. She's got an awesome car.
[2905.34s -> 2913.13s]  All right, Nancy, let's go.
[2913.13s -> 2917.70s]  Welcome to the Resi... Resistance. Residence.
[2917.70s -> 2920.34s]  Nancy Schramm will be the first member of your DedSec team.
[2920.34s -> 2922.50s]  Continue growing your team by recruiting new members.
[2927.16s -> 2932.57s]  I was just...
[2934.38s -> 2937.83s]  Okay, this guy's a Satanist.
[2937.83s -> 2939.48s]  I'm not a Satanist.
[2942.68s -> 2945.32s]  What's with this little blue sedan? Where's my sports car?
[2945.88s -> 2955.78s]  The game is fucking loud.
[2959.61s -> 2960.65s]  Okay, here we go.
[2964.44s -> 2966.12s]  Hold on. This game is loud as shit.
[2966.12s -> 2967.56s]  Turn it down. There we go.
[2969.56s -> 2971.24s]  Okay, locate the safe house entrance.
[2972.20s -> 2975.32s]  Press... What the hell is that?
[2975.32s -> 2976.84s]  What is that button? What is this way, that way?
[2976.84s -> 2978.44s]  What is this way, that way? What button is that?
[2979.08s -> 2982.20s]  Tab? It's a waypoint.
[2982.20s -> 2985.82s]  Okay, what a waypoint.
[2985.82s -> 2995.22s]  Okay, let's go. Locate the safe house.
[2995.22s -> 3000.31s]  All right, that's a handbrake.
[3000.87s -> 3003.83s]  Brake, drive, toggle music, change music, auto drive.
[3003.83s -> 3004.95s]  Wait, there's an auto drive?
[3019.46s -> 3020.98s]  This looks like shit.
[3022.23s -> 3024.31s]  This looks like Nintendo 64.
[3029.74s -> 3031.90s]  Why does it look like Nintendo 64?
[3032.78s -> 3035.59s]  Is this the wrong way? It don't matter.
[3035.59s -> 3038.39s]  There's no... There's no police in this game, is there?
[3039.03s -> 3061.29s]  Don't move!
[3066.55s -> 3067.35s]  Watch dogs.
[3067.91s -> 3071.22s]  They don't even care? No, apparently not.
[3071.22s -> 3076.54s]  Where's this GPS taking me?
[3076.54s -> 3089.00s]  Where is this GPS taking me?
[3089.00s -> 3097.35s]  What is happening?
[3097.35s -> 3102.14s]  I'm supposed to follow the blue arrow, right?
[3114.33s -> 3115.61s]  Wrong side of the road.
[3115.61s -> 3117.29s]  Oh, that's right. We're in...
[3117.29s -> 3118.57s]  We're not in America.
[3118.57s -> 3123.03s]  Well, that's going to be horrible.
[3123.03s -> 3123.91s]  Hack this guy.
[3123.91s -> 3129.86s]  I can... Wait, I can drive his car?
[3129.86s -> 3136.57s]  Wait. Oh, that's too bad.
[3136.57s -> 3137.61s]  All right, let's go.
[3137.61s -> 3140.39s]  Oh, I found it. It's right here.
[3140.39s -> 3148.07s]  I don't have a high enough hacker level?
[3148.07s -> 3149.35s]  Oh, that's not cool.
[3149.35s -> 3150.63s]  All right, get out here.
[3150.63s -> 3160.70s]  All right, I made it.
[3160.70s -> 3161.98s]  Oh, you blood don'ts.
[3169.74s -> 3170.54s]  Manual override.
[3175.98s -> 3177.42s]  Okay, access point.
[3177.42s -> 3180.06s]  Use to rotate the nodes.
[3180.06s -> 3181.66s]  Complete the circuit to solve the puzzle.
[3185.27s -> 3185.91s]  Rotate the...
[3186.55s -> 3188.15s]  What is going on in 2020
[3188.15s -> 3189.75s]  with these fucking rotate puzzles?
[3194.57s -> 3197.21s]  This is very, very, very, very, very much
[3197.21s -> 3202.82s]  the exact same thing that we did in Alex.
[3202.82s -> 3205.06s]  Okay, you're going to have to manual override it
[3205.06s -> 3205.78s]  to the painting.
[3208.63s -> 3209.67s]  All right, that's unlocked.
[3210.74s -> 3212.58s]  That's unlocked. That's good.
[3212.58s -> 3213.54s]  Now I have to go like this.
[3213.54s -> 3214.34s]  Unlock this one.
[3215.06s -> 3217.29s]  Open that fucking door.
[3226.20s -> 3231.27s]  Radiator. Open the radiator?
[3231.27s -> 3233.03s]  Oh, this is our secret hideout.
[3233.03s -> 3243.46s]  Oh, we're up the safe house.
[3243.46s -> 3245.30s]  Right, because I'm the only operative ever
[3245.54s -> 3246.50s]  that exists.
[3246.50s -> 3247.14s]  It's just me.
[3252.09s -> 3254.84s]  All right, let's boot it back up.
[3262.33s -> 3263.05s]  You drove the car.
[3263.05s -> 3264.01s]  Now you can stop playing.
[3272.78s -> 3273.28s]  Stop.
[3275.26s -> 3277.26s]  My name is Nancy Schwab.
[3280.06s -> 3280.78s]  I'm with Sabine.
[3280.78s -> 3281.98s]  Who the hell do you think you are?
[3291.74s -> 3301.18s]  Who says that?
[3301.18s -> 3302.54s]  What cartoon character says that?
[3303.10s -> 3305.10s]  What power that you could possibly imagine?
[3305.98s -> 3312.60s]  Oh, what's this?
[3319.06s -> 3320.82s]  That's how you make a 100-hour game, by the way.
[3321.38s -> 3321.78s]  Not me.
[3322.34s -> 3324.10s]  I'll be done in about 12 hours.
[3324.66s -> 3334.86s]  Probably less than that.
[3334.86s -> 3336.86s]  All right, I activated Bagley's servers.
[3338.62s -> 3348.46s]  What about the mask?
[3355.66s -> 3356.30s]  Oh, there's a mask.
[3358.30s -> 3358.86s]  Wait, loot?
[3360.78s -> 3361.98s]  Wait, can I drop loot?
[3362.86s -> 3364.38s]  Doesn't Ubisoft do stuff like that?
[3364.38s -> 3366.30s]  Can I drop a box on the stream?
[3370.54s -> 3371.10s]  Can I do that?
[3378.54s -> 3379.90s]  All right, let's contact Sabine.
[3379.90s -> 3380.46s]  Mask.
[3380.46s -> 3381.58s]  Oh, I got a pig mask.
[3382.22s -> 3386.55s]  Where's my, do I have an inventory?
[3387.19s -> 3391.05s]  Where's inventory?
[3391.05s -> 3397.88s]  It's Saw.
[3402.30s -> 3404.14s]  Make some pig noises for that mask.
[3404.14s -> 3406.84s]  Okay, this is for you.
[3406.84s -> 3407.80s]  I don't even know who said that, but sure.
[3419.21s -> 3420.41s]  Is your memory intact?
[3420.41s -> 3421.45s]  Not even slightly.
[3421.45s -> 3424.01s]  The last record I have is of our HQ being raided.
[3424.01s -> 3426.49s]  My only lead is a group known as Zero Day.
[3426.49s -> 3427.21s]  Ring any bells?
[3431.21s -> 3432.01s]  Don't blame me.
[3432.01s -> 3433.37s]  Blame the person that told me to do that.
[3435.06s -> 3436.18s]  That was pretty good, though, wasn't it?
[3436.18s -> 3437.50s]  Just one chance.
[3437.50s -> 3439.42s]  They just gunned everyone down.
[3439.42s -> 3440.97s]  My god.
[3440.97s -> 3441.85s]  How'd you survive?
[3443.10s -> 3445.02s]  I managed to escape through the sewers to Camden.
[3445.02s -> 3445.66s]  That's pretty good.
[3445.66s -> 3446.06s]  What's wrong with it?
[3446.06s -> 3447.34s]  A contact snuck up with me out of the city,
[3447.34s -> 3449.34s]  and I've been hiding out in the north since.
[3449.34s -> 3449.90s]  Prudent.
[3449.90s -> 3452.30s]  Your profile is read flagged as a high-priority target
[3452.30s -> 3453.74s]  in the city's surveillance system.
[3453.74s -> 3455.42s]  Even a partial recognition here would have you
[3455.42s -> 3456.86s]  hunted down and shot on sight.
[3457.66s -> 3460.14s]  There aren't many DedSec fans in London these days.
[3461.26s -> 3462.62s]  Look, I want to help.
[3462.62s -> 3463.26s]  I do.
[3463.26s -> 3466.30s]  But joining up with you now verges on suicidal.
[3466.30s -> 3468.70s]  Listen, if anyone knows anything about risks, it's me.
[3469.50s -> 3471.50s]  I lost everything and everyone.
[3472.38s -> 3473.67s]  But it comes down to this.
[3475.24s -> 3476.84s]  London is in a death spiral.
[3478.01s -> 3479.77s]  And if DedSec can't pull it out,
[3479.77s -> 3481.37s]  trust me, no one can.
[3482.17s -> 3483.29s]  Actually moving so much?
[3483.29s -> 3484.97s]  City needs a resistance.
[3484.97s -> 3487.85s]  Yeah, I mean, it is kind of like a puppeteer.
[3488.49s -> 3490.57s]  It's like moving the head around every word
[3490.57s -> 3493.05s]  to make sure you over-enunciate everything.
[3493.05s -> 3493.85s]  Fine.
[3493.85s -> 3495.53s]  That's how puppeteers do it.
[3495.53s -> 3496.97s]  Excellent.
[3496.97s -> 3498.57s]  New user registered.
[3498.57s -> 3500.25s]  Welcome to DedSec.
[3500.25s -> 3501.05s]  I'm not going to skip this.
[3502.90s -> 3505.78s]  Guys, I'm allowed to play one, like,
[3505.78s -> 3508.50s]  six out of ten AAA release a year, okay?
[3508.50s -> 3510.66s]  Now, it would be irresponsible of us to release you
[3510.66s -> 3512.42s]  naked and mewling into the wild.
[3512.42s -> 3513.94s]  You'll find equipment around the safe house
[3513.94s -> 3516.02s]  that are essential items in your DedSec kit.
[3516.02s -> 3516.82s]  Pick a better one.
[3516.82s -> 3520.42s]  I just came out fucking two hours ago.
[3520.42s -> 3521.78s]  It just released.
[3521.78s -> 3522.26s]  I don't know.
[3522.90s -> 3529.02s]  Tech points can be found throughout London
[3529.02s -> 3530.38s]  using the purchase tech upgrades.
[3530.94s -> 3532.14s]  Gadgets and weapons.
[3532.14s -> 3532.78s]  Cool.
[3532.78s -> 3537.29s]  Equipping tech to change an operative's weapon
[3537.29s -> 3539.69s]  or gadget use the edit function in the team menu.
[3540.68s -> 3541.00s]  Nice.
[3541.64s -> 3543.18s]  Spend tech points.
[3544.65s -> 3546.73s]  Ooh, tech points.
[3547.78s -> 3548.26s]  What's this?
[3548.98s -> 3551.10s]  I got ten tech points.
[3551.10s -> 3553.90s]  Chase drones can be hijacked.
[3553.90s -> 3556.06s]  AR camouflage to render that we're invisible
[3556.06s -> 3558.09s]  and break line of sight.
[3558.09s -> 3559.38s]  Cool.
[3559.38s -> 3563.94s]  This is an LTL-68P DedSec pistol.
[3565.98s -> 3568.06s]  These look like Team Fortress weapons.
[3568.06s -> 3573.75s]  Ooh, infiltrator spider bot.
[3573.75s -> 3575.38s]  A stealth-based spider bot
[3575.38s -> 3579.27s]  capable of performing non-lethal takedowns.
[3579.27s -> 3580.15s]  Chat.
[3580.15s -> 3581.27s]  Should we get that one, chat?
[3583.02s -> 3583.98s]  Yeah, sure.
[3583.98s -> 3590.22s]  All right, data.
[3590.22s -> 3591.10s]  Cool.
[3591.10s -> 3591.67s]  All right.
[3592.31s -> 3594.41s]  Edit operative.
[3594.41s -> 3597.24s]  All right, you have a pistol.
[3598.12s -> 3598.68s]  That works.
[3599.40s -> 3600.52s]  You've got a nice car.
[3601.16s -> 3603.48s]  And we're going to give you the spider robot.
[3603.48s -> 3605.02s]  Where is this?
[3605.02s -> 3606.06s]  The ultimate sports car.
[3606.06s -> 3606.70s]  Speedy and sleek.
[3606.70s -> 3608.78s]  It will never be mistaken for another car.
[3608.78s -> 3610.14s]  Oh, I can change the paint job.
[3610.62s -> 3612.41s]  Is this an Ubisoft box?
[3612.41s -> 3614.39s]  This is not an Ubisoft box, right?
[3615.78s -> 3616.82s]  Is this an Ubisoft box?
[3617.46s -> 3626.65s]  Really?
[3626.65s -> 3629.53s]  I can only buy gray and black.
[3630.17s -> 3631.93s]  I can't do like blue.
[3631.93s -> 3634.52s]  Whatever.
[3634.52s -> 3636.97s]  It's in-game.
[3636.97s -> 3637.37s]  Oh, okay.
[3637.37s -> 3640.73s]  A sophisticated system for hiding your identity from facial recognition tech.
[3640.73s -> 3645.93s]  It's called a mask.
[3645.93s -> 3646.97s]  Hold on a second.
[3646.97s -> 3647.93s]  Hold on.
[3647.93s -> 3653.50s]  Hold on a minute.
[3653.50s -> 3653.74s]  Hold on.
[3653.74s -> 3662.20s]  Everyone relax.
[3662.20s -> 3663.72s]  Yes, everybody relax.
[3663.72s -> 3670.04s]  All right, we don't have to shut the computer off.
[3670.04s -> 3671.58s]  We're here.
[3671.58s -> 3673.66s]  Perhaps we can talk about updating your wardrobe.
[3673.66s -> 3674.06s]  I mean, literally.
[3674.06s -> 3674.46s]  All right, nice.
[3674.46s -> 3678.25s]  Come on.
[3678.25s -> 3679.69s]  Buy a new PC, you fucker.
[3681.14s -> 3682.74s]  Look, all the new shit came out.
[3682.74s -> 3684.26s]  Like the 3090s.
[3684.26s -> 3687.14s]  The new AMD risen shit.
[3687.14s -> 3688.42s]  I got to get those.
[3688.42s -> 3689.78s]  What, you want me to buy?
[3689.78s -> 3691.06s]  If I'm going to buy like a new computer,
[3691.06s -> 3692.58s]  I want to buy like old hardware.
[3692.58s -> 3693.86s]  I want to get the new shit.
[3693.86s -> 3695.51s]  It's got to be available.
[3695.51s -> 3700.23s]  No, this is too many ubi bucks.
[3705.69s -> 3708.57s]  No, this is too many ubi bucks.
[3708.57s -> 3709.29s]  Facewear.
[3709.29s -> 3710.01s]  Okay.
[3710.01s -> 3713.98s]  This one's fine.
[3715.99s -> 3716.63s]  Okay, hat.
[3717.27s -> 3721.11s]  Okay, just turn into a completely different person.
[3724.60s -> 3725.72s]  All right, I want this one.
[3725.72s -> 3726.60s]  Sure, I'll take it.
[3730.81s -> 3734.39s]  Glasses.
[3734.39s -> 3734.71s]  Bag.
[3738.01s -> 3740.41s]  This is GTA 4 graphics.
[3741.05s -> 3743.05s]  It does kind of look like GTA 4.
[3745.35s -> 3748.39s]  It really does look like GTA 4.
[3749.91s -> 3755.70s]  Oh, why?
[3755.70s -> 3757.14s]  This 1080 is not even that bad.
[3765.72s -> 3766.92s]  Every setting on low.
[3766.92s -> 3767.88s]  No, I don't have...
[3767.88s -> 3769.64s]  The 1080 is not even a bad graphics card.
[3769.64s -> 3771.08s]  It's not even like four years old.
[3778.68s -> 3779.56s]  Okay, I just...
[3779.56s -> 3780.84s]  I think I just killed that person.
[3782.54s -> 3783.02s]  What happened?
[3784.87s -> 3785.43s]  Guard break.
[3788.22s -> 3788.78s]  Guard break.
[3789.34s -> 3791.80s]  Yes, nice one.
[3791.80s -> 3799.11s]  Oh my god.
[3799.11s -> 3801.11s]  Put on gloves or something, guys.
[3802.39s -> 3805.11s]  Use like fucking rock-em-boppers,
[3805.11s -> 3806.79s]  whatever it's called, sock-em-boppers.
[3809.53s -> 3810.57s]  Holy shit.
[3810.57s -> 3812.17s]  Why are you hitting each other for real?
[3812.17s -> 3812.81s]  The face.
[3825.45s -> 3826.57s]  Just the hay bakers.
[3828.78s -> 3829.74s]  Oh my god.
[3832.57s -> 3833.05s]  Throw punch.
[3833.69s -> 3835.06s]  Guard break.
[3841.59s -> 3842.47s]  Finisher.
[3842.47s -> 3848.18s]  Now, thanks for the training.
[3848.18s -> 3858.52s]  This person is really hurt.
[3859.16s -> 3866.07s]  That's where you're going to take the commercial break?
[3866.07s -> 3870.34s]  Okay, let's leave the safe house.
[3873.05s -> 3874.49s]  Right, gear in order.
[3874.49s -> 3875.85s]  No enough not to punch yourself in the face.
[3875.85s -> 3878.09s]  I've got a pistol.
[3878.09s -> 3878.81s]  Brilliant.
[3878.81s -> 3881.46s]  I'm working at mine zero day and ruin their day,
[3881.46s -> 3883.70s]  but I need someone with actual legs to do the leg work.
[3883.70s -> 3885.38s]  The 1080 came out in 2016.
[3886.18s -> 3887.14s]  It's not even that long ago.
[3887.14s -> 3888.50s]  If we want to change the perception
[3888.50s -> 3890.58s]  that we're a bunch of violent thugs,
[3890.58s -> 3893.56s]  let you be the judge of how best to handle yourself.
[3893.56s -> 3896.76s]  But remember, you represent Deadset now.
[3897.66s -> 3900.41s]  Yes, it is four years old.
[3900.41s -> 3901.13s]  It's not old.
[3901.93s -> 3903.21s]  Like if your work's just fine.
[3910.54s -> 3911.82s]  Start recruitment.
[3913.22s -> 3914.74s]  All right, Sabine, what's our plan?
[3914.74s -> 3917.94s]  Wait, I recruit this drunk guy?
[3921.54s -> 3922.90s]  Why can I only recruit this guy?
[3924.68s -> 3927.24s]  And all our cowering just makes it easier to step on.
[3929.74s -> 3930.54s]  Only old people.
[3930.54s -> 3931.10s]  I just want to look.
[3931.10s -> 3931.66s]  I just want to see.
[3931.66s -> 3933.98s]  You look like the sort who might want to take back their city.
[3933.98s -> 3936.14s]  Are you Deadset?
[3936.14s -> 3938.54s]  If you are, I need help with something.
[3938.54s -> 3940.78s]  If I was, I certainly wouldn't say so.
[3941.42s -> 3942.70s]  Now, what's the situation?
[3943.34s -> 3945.18s]  These Kelly maggots.
[3945.18s -> 3946.38s]  Zoomer haircut.
[3946.38s -> 3948.70s]  They burned down my cousin's dry cleaning shop
[3948.70s -> 3950.70s]  because he said no to pain protection.
[3952.70s -> 3953.90s]  How dreadful.
[3953.90s -> 3955.74s]  I know who it was that set the fire.
[3955.74s -> 3956.46s]  But the cops...
[3956.46s -> 3957.90s]  You're wearing a Dedsec hat.
[3957.90s -> 3959.18s]  The police won't help you, darling.
[3959.90s -> 3960.78s]  But we will.
[3960.78s -> 3961.26s]  Yeah, I am.
[3961.26s -> 3964.22s]  Rest assured, these gangsters will be put away.
[3966.22s -> 3967.98s]  That's not very sneaky.
[3971.40s -> 3973.56s]  All right, so we got a new recruit member.
[3974.20s -> 3976.36s]  All right.
[3976.36s -> 3977.56s]  Dedsec, chapter started.
[3977.56s -> 3978.44s]  Squad goals.
[3978.44s -> 3979.72s]  Potential recruit right here.
[3995.10s -> 3996.54s]  Is he still a recruit?
[3998.86s -> 3999.74s]  Okay, he's still...
[4000.86s -> 4003.34s]  We're just having a little bit of fun, I guess.
[4006.14s -> 4009.18s]  Injured and hospitalized by operative Nancy Schramm.
[4009.82s -> 4012.22s]  Well, who cares about that guy anyway?
[4012.22s -> 4012.94s]  He's dead.
[4013.82s -> 4015.72s]  What about you?
[4016.44s -> 4019.85s]  You want to join us?
[4019.85s -> 4022.25s]  You look like someone who might want to fight for London.
[4022.25s -> 4024.73s]  You look like somebody that was AI-generated.
[4042.49s -> 4043.45s]  Oh, I like this guy way better.
[4043.45s -> 4044.41s]  He's a crypto guy.
[4056.62s -> 4059.10s]  I don't know why.
[4059.10s -> 4060.86s]  I thought he was holding a grenade for a second.
[4060.86s -> 4062.38s]  I was like, this guy's fucking crazy.
[4063.86s -> 4064.66s]  Okay.
[4064.66s -> 4066.66s]  Recruit Justin Johansson.
[4068.92s -> 4069.56s]  Let's do it.
[4070.20s -> 4070.84s]  So let's go.
[4071.64s -> 4072.28s]  What do I have to do?
[4073.00s -> 4077.02s]  Okay.
[4077.02s -> 4080.30s]  Justin Johansson is sympathetic to Dedsec and might be willing to join up.
[4080.30s -> 4081.58s]  Talk to them to learn more.
[4088.33s -> 4088.97s]  Shoot him.
[4088.97s -> 4090.33s]  I'm not going to shoot that guy.
[4094.10s -> 4094.58s]  Why am I?
[4094.58s -> 4094.82s]  What is it?
[4094.82s -> 4095.94s]  What is this weird helmet?
[4096.90s -> 4097.54s]  Where's my car?
[4098.26s -> 4103.22s]  There's nobody even in this car.
[4103.78s -> 4105.38s]  Why was this car just sitting here?
[4105.38s -> 4106.10s]  What?
[4106.10s -> 4111.91s]  I need a waypoint.
[4111.91s -> 4116.62s]  It's like 100 million years away.
[4117.26s -> 4118.44s]  All right.
[4118.44s -> 4118.84s]  Let's move.
[4119.40s -> 4129.48s]  I want that.
[4129.48s -> 4131.08s]  But no, it's like a piece of delivery thing.
[4131.08s -> 4131.56s]  I don't want that.
[4134.31s -> 4135.19s]  GTA 3.
[4136.63s -> 4137.67s]  It's not very good.
[4137.67s -> 4137.99s]  It isn't.
[4138.63s -> 4139.50s]  But it's okay.
[4146.50s -> 4146.82s]  Yep.
[4148.01s -> 4148.25s]  Yep.
[4155.93s -> 4157.37s]  It's so ugly.
[4157.37s -> 4158.33s]  It's okay.
[4158.33s -> 4158.97s]  It's okay.
[4159.93s -> 4162.01s]  Wait.
[4162.97s -> 4163.53s]  Recruit.
[4171.72s -> 4171.96s]  Okay.
[4172.52s -> 4174.36s]  So I have this watchdog stream.
[4175.00s -> 4177.24s]  Anybody else's watchdog stream look like shit?
[4177.88s -> 4180.41s]  Is this like a game thing or is this a computer thing?
[4180.97s -> 4191.10s]  It's both.
[4191.96s -> 4192.28s]  Oops.
[4198.20s -> 4200.60s]  An invisible man was just in the road
[4200.60s -> 4203.08s]  and just grabbed me by the back of my collar.
[4203.72s -> 4208.49s]  Who is?
[4208.49s -> 4213.14s]  This person is doing graffiti.
[4216.70s -> 4217.50s]  Bye.
[4217.50s -> 4226.81s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[4226.81s -> 4229.86s]  Why would you do that?
[4230.58s -> 4231.70s]  What were you thinking?
[4233.06s -> 4233.94s]  What are you doing?
[4234.90s -> 4236.34s]  What a fucking idiot.
[4240.73s -> 4241.93s]  Hack the world.
[4246.09s -> 4246.49s]  Okay.
[4247.37s -> 4247.93s]  Let's go.
[4250.71s -> 4253.59s]  I caved in that lady's chest.
[4257.77s -> 4258.17s]  Okay.
[4278.47s -> 4279.43s]  I need to take a second.
[4281.11s -> 4282.07s]  Holy shit.
[4282.07s -> 4283.83s]  People just walk in front of your car.
[4284.39s -> 4286.15s]  Oh, this is a play ball.
[4287.56s -> 4289.24s]  Hit the inputs in time to hit the ball.
[4289.88s -> 4293.05s]  What is this?
[4293.05s -> 4296.01s]  According to an official post on Ubisoft 4,
[4296.01s -> 4297.61s]  a watchdog's legion bug was detected
[4297.61s -> 4300.01s]  which would cause performance issues on the game.
[4300.01s -> 4300.97s]  While releasing the hotfix,
[4300.97s -> 4302.25s]  the developer wrote in the post,
[4302.25s -> 4304.33s]  we're developing a hotfix to address the performance issues
[4304.33s -> 4306.65s]  we're seeing on PS4, Xbox, and PC.
[4306.65s -> 4309.43s]  The hotfix has been deployed on PS4 and Xbox.
[4309.43s -> 4311.43s]  PC gamers are left away today as the dev...
[4311.43s -> 4316.34s]  Yeah.
[4316.34s -> 4316.98s]  Okay.
[4316.98s -> 4318.66s]  Hit the inputs in time...
[4318.66s -> 4319.94s]  My whole body hurts.
[4319.94s -> 4320.34s]  Hold on.
[4321.37s -> 4321.93s]  Ahem.
[4321.93s -> 4325.69s]  Hit the inputs in time to hit the ball.
[4325.69s -> 4326.41s]  Okay.
[4326.41s -> 4328.42s]  Get a number of perfect hits to do tricks.
[4328.98s -> 4330.01s]  Let's go.
[4330.65s -> 4334.42s]  Okay.
[4334.42s -> 4335.14s]  Let's go.
[4335.14s -> 4335.62s]  A, L.
[4336.42s -> 4342.34s]  I did it again.
[4357.34s -> 4357.90s]  Wrong move!
[4357.90s -> 4358.70s]  What are you talking about?
[4359.90s -> 4360.30s]  Do it again.
[4362.07s -> 4363.35s]  In heels, yeah.
[4363.35s -> 4363.59s]  What?
[4363.59s -> 4364.87s]  That's a different key.
[4369.14s -> 4369.54s]  What the...
[4369.54s -> 4371.06s]  These are different keys.
[4371.06s -> 4372.26s]  A, S, and K, and L.
[4392.46s -> 4395.26s]  I mean, that's...
[4395.26s -> 4395.66s]  Whatever.
[4396.78s -> 4396.94s]  Wait.
[4396.94s -> 4397.50s]  What am I doing?
[4398.14s -> 4403.86s]  Oh, I gotta go in here.
[4417.78s -> 4418.42s]  Hack.
[4418.42s -> 4419.05s]  All right.
[4419.05s -> 4419.53s]  I hacked it.
[4420.09s -> 4427.35s]  Okay.
[4427.35s -> 4429.59s]  We have to steal the crypto.
[4429.59s -> 4440.90s]  Wait, these are bad guys?
[4440.90s -> 4441.62s]  That guy's a gun.
[4448.38s -> 4448.62s]  Wait.
[4448.62s -> 4449.10s]  Hold on.
[4449.10s -> 4450.22s]  I don't want to kill this guy.
[4450.78s -> 4456.66s]  What's going on?
[4457.40s -> 4458.12s]  Oh, shit.
[4458.12s -> 4458.36s]  Okay.
[4458.36s -> 4459.72s]  I steal the crypto key.
[4460.28s -> 4464.74s]  All right.
[4464.74s -> 4465.14s]  It's down there.
[4465.14s -> 4482.70s]  I got it.
[4482.70s -> 4482.94s]  Wait.
[4482.94s -> 4484.42s]  There's permadeath.
[4484.42s -> 4485.46s]  There's actually permadeath.
[4485.46s -> 4486.02s]  There's permadeath.
[4486.02s -> 4486.98s]  There's permadeath.
[4486.98s -> 4491.30s]  Hack the drone.
[4491.30s -> 4491.78s]  Hack the drone.
[4496.70s -> 4496.94s]  What?
[4496.94s -> 4498.06s]  This gun didn't even do anything.
[4498.78s -> 4499.86s]  Get back in the car.
[4500.66s -> 4507.19s]  Okay.
[4507.19s -> 4509.03s]  So this is like a gang hideout.
[4509.03s -> 4510.41s]  Evaded.
[4510.41s -> 4511.45s]  Do you need a minute?
[4511.45s -> 4513.61s]  Ready when you are, my little robot friend.
[4513.61s -> 4519.66s]  Why are people screaming?
[4519.66s -> 4523.78s]  I just heard somebody go...
[4524.74s -> 4531.88s]  What's going on?
[4531.88s -> 4533.32s]  Why was we freaking out?
[4533.32s -> 4541.77s]  Can't climb this?
[4541.77s -> 4542.33s]  Okay.
[4542.33s -> 4548.89s]  All right.
[4548.89s -> 4550.01s]  Let's sneak in here.
[4550.01s -> 4551.61s]  I gotta recruit this guy.
[4551.61s -> 4561.61s]  I have to.
[4561.61s -> 4561.93s]  Okay.
[4561.93s -> 4562.57s]  I gotta go up here.
[4562.57s -> 4562.73s]  All right.
[4562.73s -> 4562.97s]  I'm gonna...
[4562.97s -> 4563.29s]  Let's do it.
[4563.29s -> 4563.85s]  Let's do it for real.
[4563.85s -> 4564.41s]  For real.
[4564.41s -> 4567.35s]  Let's take the hacker spider over there.
[4567.35s -> 4567.91s]  All right.
[4567.91s -> 4570.70s]  All right.
[4570.70s -> 4572.22s]  I'm gonna deploy hacker spider.
[4572.22s -> 4581.80s]  So I can do a stealth...
[4581.80s -> 4582.04s]  Wait.
[4582.04s -> 4583.00s]  What's V, right?
[4583.00s -> 4583.24s]  Okay.
[4583.24s -> 4583.56s]  Hold on.
[4583.56s -> 4584.44s]  What do we got?
[4584.44s -> 4586.10s]  We got...
[4586.10s -> 4587.30s]  Oh, there's a drone right there.
[4587.30s -> 4587.94s]  All right.
[4587.94s -> 4589.70s]  It's like a Pokemon fight here.
[4589.70s -> 4592.26s]  Can I hack that?
[4598.50s -> 4598.90s]  Disable.
[4599.46s -> 4600.26s]  I can't disable it.
[4607.42s -> 4607.90s]  Oh, wait.
[4607.90s -> 4608.78s]  I got a camera right there.
[4609.34s -> 4609.66s]  All right.
[4609.66s -> 4610.30s]  Hack that camera.
[4611.03s -> 4612.63s]  I'll use this camera to hack that thing.
[4613.35s -> 4614.15s]  Hack it.
[4614.15s -> 4616.10s]  Goodbye.
[4616.10s -> 4616.50s]  See ya.
[4617.14s -> 4620.63s]  Wait.
[4620.63s -> 4621.35s]  What?
[4621.35s -> 4625.54s]  No.
[4625.54s -> 4626.34s]  What happened to the spider?
[4628.25s -> 4628.81s]  Oh, shit.
[4628.81s -> 4629.29s]  This is bad.
[4629.93s -> 4641.54s]  All right.
[4641.54s -> 4642.18s]  I just gotta go...
[4642.18s -> 4642.66s]  Okay.
[4642.66s -> 4644.18s]  Let's distract.
[4644.18s -> 4644.98s]  Okay.
[4644.98s -> 4649.22s]  I'm gonna drive this car.
[4649.22s -> 4649.94s]  Wait.
[4649.94s -> 4652.81s]  He's gonna walk into it.
[4652.81s -> 4654.25s]  I can make it go backwards?
[4654.25s -> 4654.49s]  All right.
[4654.49s -> 4654.89s]  I'm gonna make it...
[4654.89s -> 4655.21s]  I'm gonna drive...
[4655.21s -> 4656.62s]  I'm gonna run him over.
[4656.62s -> 4656.94s]  Say it.
[4656.94s -> 4657.18s]  All right.
[4657.18s -> 4657.74s]  Enemy.
[4657.74s -> 4660.65s]  All right.
[4660.65s -> 4661.77s]  Just move over there.
[4661.77s -> 4662.89s]  And here we go.
[4662.89s -> 4663.53s]  Ready?
[4663.53s -> 4671.21s]  Go get it.
[4671.21s -> 4678.04s]  Hack that.
[4678.04s -> 4678.44s]  What is it?
[4678.44s -> 4678.84s]  A book?
[4678.84s -> 4680.12s]  How do you hack a book?
[4680.12s -> 4687.77s]  Oh, shit.
[4687.77s -> 4688.17s]  Oh, shit.
[4688.17s -> 4688.49s]  Oh, shit.
[4688.49s -> 4688.89s]  Oh, shit.
[4688.89s -> 4689.13s]  Oh, shit.
[4689.13s -> 4689.53s]  Oh, shit.
[4689.53s -> 4689.85s]  Oh, shit.
[4689.85s -> 4690.73s]  Oh, shit.
[4690.73s -> 4693.88s]  Turn him off.
[4693.88s -> 4694.44s]  Disable him.
[4695.08s -> 4696.41s]  Disable him.
[4707.78s -> 4708.42s]  What?
[4708.42s -> 4711.72s]  I have a car in my backpack?
[4711.72s -> 4720.58s]  What the fuck?
[4740.54s -> 4741.82s]  What the fuck?
[4741.82s -> 4747.32s]  Here are the frames.
[4747.88s -> 4748.76s]  Don't blame me.
[4748.76s -> 4750.20s]  Blame Ubisoft.
[4750.20s -> 4752.46s]  They're the ones that have a hot fix coming out.
[4752.46s -> 4753.98s]  A game came out, but it's not ready.
[4754.22s -> 4754.62s]  Who cares?
[4754.62s -> 4755.42s]  Put it out anyways.
[4758.22s -> 4760.38s]  Those fucking idiots on PC.
[4761.58s -> 4763.90s]  See you in a week when it actually works.
[4763.90s -> 4775.11s]  I'm getting in here.
[4787.58s -> 4788.30s]  This is too hard.
[4788.30s -> 4805.06s]  There's too much shit in here that I have to deal with.
[4805.06s -> 4805.78s]  The two drones...
[4805.78s -> 4807.14s]  There's like four drones here.
[4807.14s -> 4809.56s]  I'm not supposed to be over here right now.
[4809.56s -> 4810.92s]  There's no way I'm supposed to be over here.
[4810.92s -> 4812.78s]  This shit...
[4812.78s -> 4814.54s]  There's like four drones.
[4814.54s -> 4822.63s]  Wait.
[4822.63s -> 4823.67s]  This is my bike.
[4823.67s -> 4830.78s]  Steal the van?
[4834.33s -> 4834.73s]  Go get it.
[4836.06s -> 4838.68s]  Go get it.
[4838.68s -> 4840.36s]  What the fuck, man?
[4840.36s -> 4842.90s]  Go.
[4844.89s -> 4845.93s]  Go get the van.
[4845.93s -> 4854.41s]  It's right there.
[4854.41s -> 4855.29s]  This gun doesn't...
[4862.87s -> 4863.51s]  No shit.
[4871.74s -> 4871.98s]  Go.
[4873.03s -> 4873.51s]  Go.
[4873.51s -> 4874.15s]  What are you doing?
[4874.15s -> 4875.03s]  Why is toggle on?
[4875.03s -> 4876.71s]  That was the worst decision I've made all day.
[4884.25s -> 4884.97s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[4884.97s -> 4885.61s]  Get out of the way.
[4887.53s -> 4888.57s]  How do I get the fuck out of here?
[4888.57s -> 4888.81s]  Okay.
[4889.69s -> 4890.09s]  Hack it.
[4901.98s -> 4910.50s]  Drive the van to the drop point.
[4910.50s -> 4910.90s]  You got it.
[4911.54s -> 4923.27s]  It's one kilometer away.
[4925.56s -> 4927.64s]  Why can you just make people drive?
[4929.48s -> 4929.88s]  All right.
[4929.88s -> 4931.24s]  Where's the drop zone?
[4931.24s -> 4933.26s]  Oh, this is the first actual mission.
[4935.35s -> 4936.31s]  You fucking idiots.
[4947.75s -> 4949.27s]  Here's the thing I remember about Watch Dogs.
[4949.83s -> 4951.99s]  I remember it was kind of fun to like
[4951.99s -> 4956.70s]  make the thing in the ground go up four or five times.
[4958.84s -> 4960.12s]  And then it was just like...
[4960.12s -> 4963.48s]  You just spam Q wherever you're driving.
[4963.48s -> 4965.08s]  That's all I remember.
[4965.08s -> 4965.80s]  It's just going like this.
[4966.60s -> 4970.94s]  Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q.
[4971.90s -> 4973.18s]  Oh, the hydrogen exploded.
[4982.89s -> 4983.77s]  Two FPS?
[4983.77s -> 4984.89s]  It's not going two FPS.
[4991.53s -> 4992.33s]  It is?
[4992.33s -> 4992.89s]  No, it's not.
[4993.53s -> 5010.86s]  It's 30.
[5010.86s -> 5011.26s]  Yeah.
[5011.26s -> 5014.14s]  I mean, 30 in 2020 looks like two.
[5014.14s -> 5023.72s]  All right.
[5023.72s -> 5025.80s]  We recruited the AI-generated person.
[5026.44s -> 5027.16s]  Wow.
[5027.16s -> 5027.48s]  Okay.
[5028.28s -> 5028.68s]  Whoa.
[5031.72s -> 5032.04s]  What?
[5033.61s -> 5034.49s]  You live in the van to...
[5035.21s -> 5036.01s]  What the...
[5036.01s -> 5036.81s]  What's this gas?
[5040.58s -> 5041.78s]  What the fuck is happening?
[5047.40s -> 5050.20s]  Survive until the transfer completes.
[5052.04s -> 5053.96s]  I just double tapped that guy.
[5053.96s -> 5055.64s]  That guy got hit twice in the air.
[5063.08s -> 5063.88s]  Dude, why?
[5064.76s -> 5065.88s]  Should I just drive away?
[5079.70s -> 5080.74s]  Hack everything.
[5080.74s -> 5081.94s]  I don't even know what I just did.
[5086.89s -> 5087.45s]  Reload.
[5090.47s -> 5092.79s]  Are you sure this isn't Far Cry 5?
[5093.51s -> 5094.95s]  It's the same damn company.
[5095.59s -> 5099.80s]  All right.
[5099.80s -> 5100.52s]  Nine seconds.
[5101.24s -> 5104.44s]  All right.
[5104.44s -> 5105.24s]  Nine seconds.
[5105.48s -> 5106.12s]  Four seconds.
[5106.60s -> 5108.68s]  Three, two, one.
[5108.68s -> 5109.64s]  Transfer completed.
[5112.58s -> 5113.06s]  Did I win?
[5116.92s -> 5117.40s]  Okay.
[5117.40s -> 5118.28s]  Get to safety.
[5118.84s -> 5119.40s]  Oh, fuck.
[5119.40s -> 5120.04s]  Get to safety.
[5128.38s -> 5130.62s]  I feel like this mission was very, very hard.
[5131.69s -> 5134.57s]  Am I insane for thinking that this is like ridiculous?
[5136.47s -> 5137.27s]  Oh my god.
[5145.19s -> 5146.79s]  Why would I do that to myself?
[5147.91s -> 5149.75s]  Bitcoins in critical condition?
[5150.39s -> 5154.33s]  I did it.
[5160.06s -> 5161.30s]  Get.
[5161.30s -> 5164.04s]  Get.
[5164.04s -> 5164.84s]  I recruited.
[5166.50s -> 5167.54s]  Ha, I found you.
[5170.95s -> 5171.99s]  They did find me.
[5173.66s -> 5174.14s]  Give me this.
[5179.91s -> 5190.65s]  Did the game save after that?
[5190.65s -> 5193.37s]  Please tell me the game saved after that.
[5193.37s -> 5194.17s]  Oh my god.
[5194.17s -> 5195.21s]  Thank goodness.
[5195.21s -> 5195.77s]  Point the way.
[5198.82s -> 5199.54s]  Fuck is this?
[5202.50s -> 5204.18s]  A random fight on this?
[5204.18s -> 5205.14s]  Did I get invaded?
[5215.42s -> 5216.78s]  Adversary neutralized.
[5218.54s -> 5220.38s]  What the fuck is happening in this game?
[5220.94s -> 5225.53s]  Give me this pizza vehicle.
[5229.46s -> 5229.86s]  Thank you.
[5230.50s -> 5237.66s]  I...
[5237.66s -> 5238.22s]  Give me...
[5238.22s -> 5239.34s]  Give me the vehicle.
[5239.34s -> 5240.14s]  Give me the vehicle.
[5240.70s -> 5241.58s]  Give me the vehicle.
[5248.58s -> 5250.50s]  Okay, now I've got a new recruit.
[5251.06s -> 5260.46s]  Am I supposed to be the good guy?
[5260.46s -> 5262.86s]  I have no idea what the fuck is going on, guys.
[5262.86s -> 5264.41s]  Can I recruit this person?
[5264.41s -> 5264.97s]  How can you tell?
[5265.53s -> 5274.76s]  Recruit Ruth.
[5276.70s -> 5281.50s]  Hey, Ruth.
[5281.50s -> 5283.19s]  I got a mission for you.
[5283.19s -> 5286.97s]  Come here.
[5292.63s -> 5293.51s]  Recruit Andy.
[5293.51s -> 5294.31s]  Dermapress 4.
[5300.79s -> 5301.91s]  Don't stop recruiting.
[5301.91s -> 5302.47s]  Do a mission.
[5303.91s -> 5304.31s]  I...
[5320.23s -> 5321.83s]  What is with all the drones?
[5322.95s -> 5323.91s]  They're everywhere.
[5326.63s -> 5327.51s]  Why won't he blink?
[5330.47s -> 5333.88s]  All right, I'll help you.
[5336.12s -> 5338.68s]  Can I say, hey, get on the back?
[5341.48s -> 5342.76s]  All right, I'm gonna do the mission.
[5342.76s -> 5343.56s]  I will.
[5343.56s -> 5345.80s]  Can I say, get on the back?
[5346.44s -> 5347.96s]  Press 4.
[5348.76s -> 5349.40s]  I pressed 4.
[5349.96s -> 5353.50s]  All right, I'm gonna do the real mission.
[5354.14s -> 5355.24s]  I'll go to music.
[5355.80s -> 5357.24s]  No, I turned off music.
[5357.24s -> 5358.44s]  It's probably copyright shit.
[5358.44s -> 5359.80s]  I gotta be careful with that.
[5359.80s -> 5370.33s]  Press 4 when you're off the bike.
[5373.45s -> 5373.77s]  4.
[5375.11s -> 5375.59s]  I pressed it.
[5375.59s -> 5376.55s]  Didn't do anything.
[5376.55s -> 5378.65s]  There's mail here or something.
[5378.65s -> 5379.69s]  What is this?
[5379.69s -> 5380.09s]  Deliver.
[5381.93s -> 5385.61s]  Operatives can take parcels from any pickup box and deliver them to the specific donation.
[5386.54s -> 5388.94s]  I don't know how that word came out.
[5388.94s -> 5394.17s]  Parcels can have up to three properties each with its own difficulty.
[5394.17s -> 5394.65s]  This is just...
[5394.65s -> 5394.89s]  All right.
[5394.89s -> 5396.01s]  No, that's boring.
[5396.01s -> 5397.19s]  Give me the real shit.
[5398.31s -> 5399.27s]  No, I don't want to.
[5399.27s -> 5399.83s]  Give me the real shit.
[5405.99s -> 5407.75s]  Why can't you just take armored tanks?
[5409.75s -> 5410.25s]  What?
[5412.15s -> 5413.75s]  Why am I able just to do this?
[5414.49s -> 5415.69s]  If the key's in the ignition...
[5418.92s -> 5421.51s]  What is this?
[5433.61s -> 5434.25s]  Wait, I can...
[5434.25s -> 5435.37s]  Let's turn on auto drive.
[5439.91s -> 5440.95s]  Why is it on driving?
[5441.51s -> 5446.38s]  Am I in trouble?
[5446.94s -> 5457.05s]  Auto drive stops for cars.
[5458.33s -> 5459.05s]  Oh, well.
[5459.77s -> 5462.36s]  Get away from me.
[5469.51s -> 5470.07s]  Don't play...
[5470.07s -> 5470.79s]  I didn't do anything wrong.
[5470.79s -> 5471.27s]  Don't blame me.
[5471.27s -> 5472.15s]  It's a fucking computer.
[5472.95s -> 5474.54s]  Look, I'm not...
[5474.54s -> 5475.98s]  My hands aren't even on the wheel.
[5475.98s -> 5477.26s]  My hands are not even touching the wheel.
[5477.82s -> 5480.86s]  The cop is also on auto drive.
[5482.81s -> 5484.41s]  All right, I'm gonna get in here to this mission.
[5484.97s -> 5486.57s]  I'm gonna lose this guy first.
[5494.66s -> 5495.46s]  You murdered somebody?
[5495.46s -> 5496.58s]  I did not murder anybody.
[5497.14s -> 5498.84s]  All right.
[5499.64s -> 5500.36s]  You know what?
[5501.08s -> 5510.28s]  Good luck getting through that.
[5520.25s -> 5520.57s]  Whoa!
[5528.30s -> 5529.74s]  How do they not see us doing this?
[5530.30s -> 5532.63s]  Get over here.
[5538.50s -> 5538.74s]  Fuck!
[5539.86s -> 5542.30s]  What, did you just throw a bottle?
[5542.94s -> 5549.96s]  I fucking play Dark Souls a lot.
[5550.52s -> 5572.79s]  Like that.
[5572.79s -> 5573.75s]  They didn't even look in here.
[5573.75s -> 5575.75s]  They just heard people getting the shit kicked out of them.
[5580.73s -> 5581.69s]  Sash over.
[5581.69s -> 5582.97s]  Nobody fucking here.
[5582.97s -> 5585.85s]  Is that a gun?
[5586.17s -> 5586.41s]  What?
[5594.89s -> 5595.77s]  Fortnite.
[5595.77s -> 5597.75s]  How do I get the car?
[5599.86s -> 5601.86s]  Okay, so we got to investigate this over here.
[5601.86s -> 5603.00s]  Pick this up.
[5604.12s -> 5605.16s]  Where is this?
[5605.16s -> 5610.02s]  Is it inside the building?
[5614.79s -> 5615.75s]  Press 4.
[5615.75s -> 5616.39s]  I will.
[5616.39s -> 5620.94s]  Okay, I just stole money out of that.
[5620.94s -> 5622.22s]  I unlocked that.
[5622.22s -> 5622.94s]  Let's go in here.
[5623.50s -> 5625.86s]  Oh shit, that's a bad guy.
[5627.06s -> 5638.58s]  Shoot him in the head?
[5638.58s -> 5650.18s]  Both of them?
[5650.18s -> 5650.74s]  Scream.
[5656.22s -> 5660.23s]  Okay, so I need to get up top.
[5660.23s -> 5661.67s]  Investigate their replacement.
[5661.67s -> 5673.64s]  Did I miss something in here?
[5673.64s -> 5678.42s]  This isn't your mission.
[5678.42s -> 5680.10s]  I mean, it's something very obviously.
[5680.10s -> 5681.30s]  What's the green thing up there?
[5681.30s -> 5683.54s]  Something's blinking.
[5683.54s -> 5685.19s]  I can't literally go up.
[5685.75s -> 5697.54s]  Doesn't that green thing mean there's something in here?
[5697.54s -> 5698.58s]  Oh shit, look at this.
[5699.70s -> 5700.66s]  Give me that.
[5700.66s -> 5701.48s]  How do I get that?
[5701.48s -> 5702.44s]  It's in the vent?
[5702.44s -> 5709.26s]  Oh damn, look at this right here.
[5709.26s -> 5715.32s]  Spider.
[5715.32s -> 5721.72s]  Spider.
[5721.72s -> 5725.67s]  Spider?
[5725.67s -> 5727.05s]  Why can I not use the spider?
[5727.05s -> 5727.53s]  Free.
[5727.53s -> 5733.22s]  That's going to be a shitload of money, isn't it?
[5733.22s -> 5735.42s]  Say the line.
[5735.42s -> 5735.98s]  Giant.
[5735.98s -> 5738.55s]  Why do you want me to say that?
[5738.55s -> 5739.67s]  That's such an old meme.
[5739.67s -> 5740.63s]  We're over it, aren't we?
[5740.63s -> 5751.48s]  All right, we're banging left.
[5751.48s -> 5754.15s]  And then there's going to be a package in here.
[5754.15s -> 5754.63s]  Look at it.
[5754.63s -> 5759.13s]  Pick it up.
[5759.13s -> 5759.93s]  Oh, that's tech.
[5759.93s -> 5761.69s]  Oh shit, that's 10 tech points.
[5761.69s -> 5763.34s]  Feign excitement.
[5763.34s -> 5763.98s]  Feign excitement.
[5763.98s -> 5764.70s]  Feign excitement.
[5764.70s -> 5765.26s]  What the fuck?
[5765.26s -> 5765.74s]  I...
[5765.74s -> 5766.38s]  Hey, chat.
[5766.94s -> 5768.06s]  We got 10 tech points.
[5768.06s -> 5768.78s]  Feign excitement.
[5769.83s -> 5770.23s]  Got it.
[5770.79s -> 5774.07s]  All right, leave the spider in there.
[5774.63s -> 5782.31s]  All right, press 4.
[5782.95s -> 5787.48s]  So this is not a mission?
[5788.47s -> 5789.35s]  Why is it all...
[5789.35s -> 5791.03s]  I mean, why is it yellow?
[5791.03s -> 5799.43s]  Okay, tech points.
[5799.43s -> 5802.18s]  Where's my car?
[5802.18s -> 5805.13s]  It's restricted though.
[5805.13s -> 5809.27s]  Does it get delivered to me or no?
[5809.27s -> 5813.72s]  Is that it on the minimap over there?
[5813.72s -> 5821.54s]  Is this it?
[5822.26s -> 5824.02s]  Holy shit, this thing's fucking crazy.
[5824.66s -> 5825.22s]  Is this mine?
[5825.94s -> 5826.89s]  This is my car.
[5829.67s -> 5829.99s]  Wow.
[5830.55s -> 5834.94s]  Now get in.
[5835.58s -> 5839.62s]  You picked colorblind mode.
[5840.18s -> 5853.91s]  Oh, I think I did.
[5853.91s -> 5854.55s]  Menu.
[5854.55s -> 5856.14s]  I did.
[5856.14s -> 5857.26s]  Yeah, I did.
[5857.26s -> 5859.51s]  Okay.
[5859.51s -> 5863.67s]  When I was setting it up, I was like, oh, that looks better.
[5863.67s -> 5864.95s]  Okay, that's better.
[5864.95s -> 5866.31s]  All right, that makes more sense now.
[5866.31s -> 5870.55s]  Okay, well, look, the mission marker is gold.
[5871.35s -> 5873.03s]  And I'm in a gold area.
[5873.03s -> 5873.51s]  Whatever.
[5874.15s -> 5882.90s]  All right, let's pump this.
[5882.90s -> 5886.95s]  Let's do it.
[5895.37s -> 5897.66s]  Glory.
[5897.66s -> 5899.34s]  Oh, I'm so glad we picked this lady.
[5899.34s -> 5908.70s]  Her car is sick.
[5908.70s -> 5909.42s]  Untracked mission.
[5909.42s -> 5911.34s]  Acquire Albion operations data.
[5911.34s -> 5912.14s]  No, fuck that.
[5914.31s -> 5915.75s]  Two FPS driving.
[5919.19s -> 5919.75s]  Come on, guys.
[5919.75s -> 5924.07s]  You don't like this demonstration of iPad metal hardware?
[5924.07s -> 5926.07s]  Metal graphics processing unit?
[5927.02s -> 5929.50s]  It's like eight frames a second, but it sure looks pretty good.
[5930.14s -> 5933.16s]  Or an iPad.
[5944.76s -> 5946.60s]  Spider-Man 2 graphics.
[5946.60s -> 5947.80s]  Spider-Man 2 graphics.
[5947.80s -> 5949.00s]  Spider-Man 2 graphics.
[5962.94s -> 5971.62s]  Is he just trying to make this look bad?
[5971.62s -> 5974.22s]  I don't think I have to do that.
[5974.22s -> 5974.86s]  I think it just is.
[5989.34s -> 5989.98s]  All right, this is it.
[5989.98s -> 5993.02s]  Investigate the replacement of Ruth Sen.
[5993.02s -> 5999.85s]  And aside from some heavily armed security guards, it's basically a ghost town.
[6000.57s -> 6001.85s]  Isn't that interesting?
[6001.85s -> 6002.33s]  Okay, let's go.
[6002.33s -> 6003.93s]  I don't think this replacement is also-
[6003.93s -> 6004.97s]  GTA IV.
[6004.97s -> 6006.49s]  Look around and see if you can figure out where-
[6006.49s -> 6008.62s]  Put it on the lowest setting.
[6008.62s -> 6009.58s]  It's not going to do anything.
[6010.63s -> 6012.07s]  We know that's not going to do anything.
[6013.42s -> 6014.94s]  Let me pee and figure out what I want to do.
[6016.44s -> 6019.53s]  I'll- I'll- I'm going to pee.
[6125.13s -> 6126.89s]  All right, let's try this again.
[6140.95s -> 6142.95s]  Grandma, please, you didn't update your drivers for the game
[6142.95s -> 6144.23s]  and are on the worst possible settings.
[6144.23s -> 6146.87s]  And you get annoyed at how bad it looks and how low the FPS is.
[6146.87s -> 6155.18s]  I'm going to update my drivers right now.
[6155.18s -> 6157.10s]  I'm going to update my driver stream.
[6157.10s -> 6160.25s]  Here we go.
[6160.25s -> 6161.93s]  No, but you guys told me about the hotfix.
[6161.93s -> 6164.65s]  Ubisoft is making a hotfix because the game runs like shit.
[6164.65s -> 6176.12s]  Update your drivers, man.
[6176.12s -> 6180.02s]  What is this copypasta?
[6180.02s -> 6183.22s]  You know, hey, anytime you update drivers, don't you find it really sad
[6183.22s -> 6187.38s]  when the default page that it lands on is the new cool one?
[6187.38s -> 6190.76s]  And you have to go down three drop-down menus and scroll?
[6191.48s -> 6192.20s]  Oh, fuck.
[6192.20s -> 6194.62s]  GeForce 10 series.
[6194.70s -> 6195.82s]  Oh, man.
[6196.38s -> 6200.97s]  All right, here we go.
[6200.97s -> 6202.89s]  Update my- the stream's probably going to crash.
[6202.89s -> 6203.61s]  Whatever, I'll be back.
[6211.83s -> 6212.55s]  Fuck the mods.
[6212.55s -> 6213.27s]  Why are you saying that?
[6216.50s -> 6219.24s]  Well, how come- why is everybody bullying you?
[6219.24s -> 6219.80s]  It's all right.
[6221.64s -> 6222.60s]  They don't mean it.
[6222.60s -> 6225.86s]  That's what I tell myself every time I lie down and go to sleep.
[6225.86s -> 6226.74s]  They don't mean it.
[6226.74s -> 6227.46s]  They don't mean it.
[6227.46s -> 6228.10s]  They don't mean it.
[6228.10s -> 6232.89s]  They don't mean it.
[6232.89s -> 6237.53s]  And then I refresh the page and I see like tons of toxic comments.
[6237.53s -> 6238.68s]  I'm kidding.
[6238.68s -> 6239.56s]  I really don't.
[6239.56s -> 6242.04s]  All right, here we go.
[6242.60s -> 6244.44s]  It's time to update my graphics drivers.
[6245.00s -> 6248.74s]  Are you guys ready for this?
[6248.74s -> 6250.10s]  Fucking POG moment.
[6250.10s -> 6250.66s]  Here it comes.
[6255.62s -> 6256.98s]  Oh, here it comes.
[6261.69s -> 6264.65s]  If the stream turns off, I will be back in 10 seconds.
[6264.65s -> 6274.71s]  I don't think it will, though.
[6274.71s -> 6275.51s]  Driver stream?
[6275.51s -> 6276.39s]  Oh, yeah.
[6276.39s -> 6279.45s]  I was here.
[6281.08s -> 6284.33s]  I was here for the driver stream.
[6284.89s -> 6294.62s]  I was here- I was against my will.
[6294.62s -> 6295.34s]  What?
[6295.34s -> 6303.94s]  Why- what are you doing here?
[6303.94s -> 6304.58s]  Here we go.
[6304.58s -> 6305.30s]  All right.
[6305.30s -> 6306.58s]  Nvidia graphics driver.
[6307.22s -> 6308.66s]  Agree and continue.
[6308.66s -> 6309.86s]  Don't ban me.
[6309.86s -> 6311.38s]  Don't- don't delete my stream.
[6311.38s -> 6312.74s]  I'm coming back if it does.
[6312.74s -> 6314.26s]  I'll be right back if the stream turns off.
[6314.26s -> 6314.98s]  I promise.
[6314.98s -> 6320.22s]  This is the game ready driver.
[6320.22s -> 6321.02s]  I'm ready.
[6321.02s -> 6325.82s]  I got a six pack of Mountain Dew.
[6326.38s -> 6332.39s]  I'm ready to play Legion at the highest caliber 1080p graphics.
[6332.39s -> 6344.39s]  Oh, I got what?
[6344.39s -> 6349.50s]  Wake me when it's- when it's over.
[6349.50s -> 6349.98s]  I will.
[6349.98s -> 6350.86s]  I'll scream.
[6350.86s -> 6351.26s]  Oh, yeah.
[6351.26s -> 6352.46s]  I'm going to yell right in the microphone.
[6352.46s -> 6353.02s]  I won't.
[6353.02s -> 6355.50s]  All right.
[6355.50s -> 6356.86s]  It's installing right now.
[6356.86s -> 6357.26s]  Come on.
[6357.26s -> 6357.66s]  Let's go.
[6358.46s -> 6362.76s]  Vod Watchers.
[6362.76s -> 6363.96s]  Skip five minutes.
[6363.96s -> 6365.40s]  Actually, that's a pretty good point.
[6365.40s -> 6365.96s]  Yeah.
[6365.96s -> 6367.48s]  Hey, Vod Watchers.
[6367.48s -> 6369.32s]  Just skip like two or three minutes.
[6369.32s -> 6372.28s]  Oh, hey, Vod Watchers.
[6372.36s -> 6374.84s]  Open up the next Vod that exists.
[6374.84s -> 6379.21s]  Because that's- well, it might happen.
[6381.56s -> 6382.60s]  See you in episode two.
[6382.60s -> 6383.64s]  Stream two.
[6383.64s -> 6387.43s]  Is it doing anything?
[6387.43s -> 6404.39s]  Why is it taking so long?
[6404.39s -> 6406.28s]  Hello?
[6406.28s -> 6408.68s]  Everything- everything went- everything just went black.
[6408.68s -> 6412.22s]  Am I still live?
[6412.22s -> 6412.94s]  I don't know.
[6412.94s -> 6414.90s]  I have no idea.
[6414.90s -> 6415.46s]  I might be.
[6420.62s -> 6421.98s]  Hey, I'm still live.
[6421.98s -> 6422.30s]  We're good.
[6422.30s -> 6424.47s]  I didn't have to turn the stream off.
[6424.47s -> 6425.43s]  It has been installed.
[6425.43s -> 6426.63s]  We're ready to go.
[6426.63s -> 6426.95s]  All right.
[6426.95s -> 6427.35s]  Let's go.
[6427.35s -> 6427.67s]  Let's go.
[6427.67s -> 6428.07s]  Let's go.
[6428.07s -> 6428.39s]  Let's go.
[6428.39s -> 6428.71s]  Let's go.
[6428.71s -> 6429.11s]  Let's go.
[6429.11s -> 6429.43s]  Let's go.
[6429.43s -> 6429.83s]  Let's go.
[6429.83s -> 6432.94s]  You guys hyped Watch Dogs Legion?
[6432.94s -> 6439.64s]  Let's go.
[6439.64s -> 6444.70s]  Here it comes.
[6444.70s -> 6445.34s]  Fuck, dude.
[6445.34s -> 6446.54s]  I'm so excited for this game.
[6447.10s -> 6452.76s]  You have no idea.
[6452.76s -> 6453.08s]  Hold on.
[6453.08s -> 6455.48s]  My Epic Games launcher doesn't work anymore.
[6455.48s -> 6465.94s]  Here we go.
[6465.94s -> 6475.24s]  I implore you to give this game a chance.
[6475.24s -> 6477.48s]  I know you're being a haha funny YouTuber by killing everyone
[6477.48s -> 6479.00s]  and complaining about corporate Ubisoft,
[6479.00s -> 6480.28s]  which I completely understand.
[6480.28s -> 6482.04s]  Please at least play through the first few tutorial missions
[6482.04s -> 6484.76s]  and see how social- how the social mechanics of this game are set up.
[6484.76s -> 6486.84s]  And that- it's actually a lot like the Nemesis system.
[6486.84s -> 6493.19s]  You know, the thing that you in chat absolutely loved.
[6493.19s -> 6494.47s]  I implore you.
[6494.47s -> 6497.26s]  Well, I'm- I'm not- I'm still going.
[6497.26s -> 6497.98s]  I'm still streaming.
[6497.98s -> 6499.26s]  I'm just waiting for the game to work.
[6508.98s -> 6510.58s]  Here it comes.
[6510.58s -> 6512.26s]  I promise this time it is coming.
[6512.26s -> 6517.21s]  Is that a coffee pasta or is that somebody's actual real opinion?
[6517.21s -> 6529.34s]  I'm going for it.
[6529.34s -> 6534.74s]  I'm gonna.
[6534.74s -> 6535.38s]  All right.
[6535.38s -> 6537.70s]  Stream starts now.
[6537.70s -> 6545.14s]  You heard the system booting.
[6545.14s -> 6545.62s]  There it is.
[6546.82s -> 6550.90s]  We have nude- we have the brand new today graphics drivers.
[6550.90s -> 6579.32s]  Why is everyone saying nude?
[6579.32s -> 6581.16s]  Continue.
[6581.16s -> 6585.74s]  Show it to me.
[6585.74s -> 6587.03s]  Loading screen.
[6587.03s -> 6587.59s]  Menu.
[6587.59s -> 6588.31s]  Loading screen.
[6589.18s -> 6590.30s]  60 FPS.
[6590.30s -> 6590.86s]  Incoming.
[6608.04s -> 6610.57s]  This is- this is not internet.
[6610.57s -> 6616.17s]  Oh, come on.
[6616.98s -> 6620.10s]  Did I download graphics drivers and they like fucking corrupted my system?
[6629.05s -> 6633.29s]  I'm gonna- I'm gonna put- I'm gonna load this thing up like they shoot the clay discs.
[6633.29s -> 6638.15s]  I'm just gonna pull.
[6638.15s -> 6640.46s]  I'm gonna shoot with a rocket launcher.
[6640.46s -> 6649.30s]  You downloaded the wrong drivers?
[6649.30s -> 6650.18s]  No, I didn't.
[6650.18s -> 6652.18s]  It's taking so much longer.
[6652.18s -> 6658.46s]  It's taking like three times as long.
[6658.46s -> 6659.02s]  Fuck.
[6659.02s -> 6666.79s]  Is it updating?
[6666.79s -> 6671.16s]  No, it's going.
[6671.16s -> 6672.68s]  It's- we're just gonna leave it alone.
[6672.68s -> 6689.02s]  You need to restart the computer.
[6689.02s -> 6690.54s]  Oh, God.
[6690.54s -> 6697.38s]  I just saw it tick.
[6697.38s -> 6705.83s]  Hold on.
[6705.91s -> 6713.90s]  We- is it- we in?
[6713.90s -> 6716.78s]  I'm gonna give this 30 seconds that I'm restarting my fucking computer.
[6716.78s -> 6718.73s]  Pain in the ass.
[6718.73s -> 6736.71s]  And you guys wonder why like consoles sell so well.
[6736.71s -> 6737.59s]  It is moving though.
[6737.59s -> 6746.66s]  It is.
[6746.66s -> 6749.62s]  And- and everybody else like curious to see what happens when it gets to the end.
[6749.62s -> 6759.16s]  Use the talk shit and it's done.
[6759.16s -> 6760.33s]  Yes.
[6760.33s -> 6760.81s]  We're in.
[6760.81s -> 6763.70s]  How did everything go under?
[6763.70s -> 6765.14s]  Some fresh meat.
[6765.14s -> 6765.86s]  Ready?
[6765.86s -> 6777.59s]  What the fuck happened to that guy?
[6777.59s -> 6778.57s]  All right.
[6778.57s -> 6779.93s]  Game ready driver.
[6779.93s -> 6783.78s]  What's going on over here?
[6790.17s -> 6794.89s]  Uh, this lady.
[6794.89s -> 6796.89s]  That's a lot.
[6796.89s -> 6812.39s]  How many times are you gonna do this?
[6812.39s -> 6816.23s]  Got him.
[6816.23s -> 6817.11s]  Now go, run!
[6817.11s -> 6840.17s]  All right, I'm good.
[6840.17s -> 6842.36s]  Pad frame rate.
[6842.36s -> 6846.17s]  Oh, the FPS is so bad.
[6846.17s -> 6855.59s]  It is so bad.
[6855.59s -> 6858.63s]  Lower all the- they're already pretty fucking low, man.
[6858.63s -> 6879.27s]  I can't- they don't even let you put it on low.
[6879.27s -> 6887.85s]  Why is that on?
[6887.85s -> 6888.25s]  Fuck it.
[6888.25s -> 6891.38s]  We're going- we're going 2001.
[6891.38s -> 6894.98s]  Full screen mode?
[6894.98s -> 6900.65s]  Are you telling me that's the bullshit that's gonna be a problem?
[6900.65s -> 6902.86s]  Better not be.
[6902.86s -> 6924.02s]  This better not be the fucking problem.
[6924.02s -> 6931.88s]  They're actually running better.
[6931.88s -> 6933.16s]  Use DirectX 11?
[6933.96s -> 6940.52s]  Trouble- trouble to shoot the streamer's video game so it doesn't look like GTA 3 The Stream.
[6946.49s -> 6947.85s]  Put it on DX 11?
[6947.85s -> 6948.97s]  How do I do that, though?
[6948.97s -> 6950.65s]  How do I put it on DirectX 11?
[6955.90s -> 6956.94s]  I don't know how to do that.
[6959.10s -> 6961.18s]  I'm not gonna lower the resolution.
[6965.99s -> 6966.95s]  Is it in the options?
[6966.95s -> 6967.51s]  Options?
[6967.51s -> 6970.47s]  Is it in video?
[6970.47s -> 6972.47s]  GTX 1080.
[6972.47s -> 6977.98s]  It's in the video settings.
[6977.98s -> 6979.69s]  Field of view.
[6979.69s -> 6981.05s]  F- monitor refresh rate.
[6981.05s -> 6981.85s]  Resolution.
[6981.85s -> 6985.82s]  Where do you see that?
[6987.53s -> 6989.37s]  Look, I got plenty of VRAM.
[6989.37s -> 6993.91s]  DirectX 11.
[6993.91s -> 6995.59s]  Oh god fucking damn it.
[7021.69s -> 7024.31s]  So, how was your day today?
[7024.31s -> 7028.70s]  Worst stream 2020.
[7028.70s -> 7030.38s]  Contender incoming.
[7030.38s -> 7032.84s]  I'll be your host for the evening.
[7032.84s -> 7035.98s]  Streamer left.
[7035.98s -> 7042.38s]  He walked out after he had to restart his game 15 times and went to crash twice in the tutorial.
[7042.38s -> 7047.74s]  He had to download game-ready Legion drivers.
[7047.74s -> 7050.14s]  He since has gone out of the room.
[7050.14s -> 7055.62s]  I'll be playing now.
[7055.62s -> 7060.95s]  I'm a better streamer.
[7060.95s -> 7062.31s]  Restart your fucking computer.
[7063.75s -> 7065.59s]  If I restart the computer, the stream goes off.
[7066.39s -> 7069.67s]  I need like a stream battery that keeps the stream turned on.
[7069.67s -> 7078.34s]  Let's go.
[7078.34s -> 7079.22s]  DX 11.
[7079.22s -> 7080.10s]  Not DX 12.
[7080.10s -> 7080.82s]  That's the bad one.
[7080.82s -> 7081.54s]  That's the one that sucks.
[7081.54s -> 7083.22s]  That's the one that causes problems for every PC.
[7083.22s -> 7084.18s]  I remember that.
[7084.18s -> 7097.10s]  You're number five in the Watch Dogs category.
[7097.10s -> 7097.90s]  Fuck.
[7097.90s -> 7102.86s]  Look at how lightning quick that just loaded.
[7102.86s -> 7104.06s]  Did you see that?
[7104.06s -> 7106.42s]  This is the fastest I've ever seen a loading screen start.
[7106.42s -> 7137.37s]  Remember, do you have an SSD?
[7137.37s -> 7138.97s]  Yes, I have three of them.
[7139.05s -> 7142.41s]  All right.
[7142.41s -> 7146.81s]  My computer might be a few years old, but it's not like I have hard drives in here.
[7146.81s -> 7150.60s]  He's fuming right now.
[7150.60s -> 7156.79s]  Actually, that's kind of entertaining in a way for me.
[7156.79s -> 7158.07s]  DX 11 Andy.
[7158.07s -> 7167.67s]  You're the second highest English-speaking Watch Dogs streamer.
[7167.67s -> 7168.87s]  Who's the first?
[7168.87s -> 7170.07s]  Why can't I be number one?
[7188.65s -> 7190.33s]  Mechanical Drive Matthew.
[7190.89s -> 7191.45s]  Stop.
[7191.45s -> 7191.85s]  All right.
[7191.85s -> 7192.41s]  This is it.
[7192.41s -> 7194.09s]  I'm getting in here and I'm playing.
[7194.09s -> 7198.01s]  And if not, I'll hold the power button off on my fucking computer.
[7198.01s -> 7199.53s]  I swear to God, if it's still fucked up.
[7199.53s -> 7201.77s]  And I'm going to turn it back on to turn and come back in five minutes.
[7201.77s -> 7218.66s]  You can't be number one because the other guy's not doing a troubleshooting stream.
[7218.66s -> 7219.06s]  Shit.
[7219.06s -> 7220.18s]  I need a better computer.
[7220.18s -> 7221.86s]  I need a better computer.
[7221.86s -> 7223.72s]  I gotta get a better computer now.
[7241.27s -> 7242.39s]  Oh, shit.
[7242.39s -> 7246.04s]  And I think it just needed a few minutes to load.
[7246.04s -> 7249.51s]  Dude, this looks fine.
[7249.51s -> 7255.26s]  This looks pretty.
[7255.26s -> 7256.06s]  This looks okay.
[7256.06s -> 7259.98s]  This looks all right.
[7259.98s -> 7260.30s]  Wait.
[7260.30s -> 7261.10s]  Why is it?
[7261.10s -> 7262.06s]  What is it doing that?
[7262.06s -> 7265.22s]  No, no, no.
[7265.22s -> 7265.54s]  Trust me.
[7265.54s -> 7265.86s]  Trust me.
[7265.86s -> 7266.26s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7266.26s -> 7269.02s]  Wait for it to refresh a little bit.
[7269.02s -> 7270.63s]  Bingo.
[7270.63s -> 7271.35s]  Bingo.
[7271.35s -> 7272.39s]  We got 60 FPS.
[7272.39s -> 7272.79s]  Let's go.
[7280.82s -> 7283.66s]  Fuck.
[7283.66s -> 7284.62s]  What happened?
[7287.75s -> 7289.11s]  Skipped frames detected.
[7289.11s -> 7289.83s]  What's doing this?
[7289.83s -> 7290.55s]  Why is it doing this?
[7290.55s -> 7291.27s]  What's going on?
[7300.57s -> 7301.13s]  I'll be back.
[7301.13s -> 7302.09s]  Give me five minutes.
[7302.09s -> 7302.97s]  Fucking turn the computer.
[7302.97s -> 7303.85s]  I'm just turning the computer off.
[7303.85s -> 7304.89s]  I'm not even going to turn the stream off.
[7304.89s -> 7306.25s]  I'm just turning off the computer.
[7306.25s -> 7307.13s]  I'm restarting.
[7307.13s -> 7309.05s]  I can't even restart my computer.
[7309.05s -> 7310.33s]  The Windows button doesn't even work.
[7310.33s -> 7314.81s]  I'm back into...
[7314.81s -> 7317.56s]  I'm just hitting the power button.
[7317.56s -> 7318.68s]  I'll be back in two minutes.
[7319.64s -> 7321.56s]  Come back and watch my watchdog streams.
[7321.56s -> 7322.36s]  I'm number two.
[7322.36s -> 7323.00s]  God damn it.
[7323.00s -> 7324.60s]  I'm going to be number one.
[7324.60s -> 7326.20s]  Hey, hey, hey.
[7326.20s -> 7326.60s]  I'm here.
[7326.60s -> 7327.32s]  I'm here.
[7327.32s -> 7327.80s]  Number two.
[7327.80s -> 7328.20s]  Come on.
[7328.20s -> 7330.20s]  I'm the number two guy right here.
[7330.20s -> 7331.50s]  Hey, I'm back.
[7331.50s -> 7331.74s]  I'm back.
[7331.74s -> 7332.06s]  I'm back.
[7332.06s -> 7332.38s]  OK.
[7332.38s -> 7333.50s]  I restarted the stream.
[7333.50s -> 7334.95s]  I restarted.
[7334.95s -> 7336.71s]  Watchdog's Legion is now starting.
[7336.71s -> 7338.46s]  Here we go.
[7338.46s -> 7339.18s]  It's coming.
[7339.18s -> 7341.32s]  Somebody said, wow,
[7341.32s -> 7342.60s]  Shroud's stream looks great.
[7343.40s -> 7344.04s]  I'm sure it does.
[7344.04s -> 7345.32s]  I'm sure it looks fantastic.
[7345.32s -> 7346.68s]  I'm sure it looks really good.
[7346.68s -> 7347.16s]  But mine...
[7348.12s -> 7349.56s]  I'm going to get a better computer soon
[7349.56s -> 7350.76s]  and then it'll be better.
[7350.76s -> 7365.91s]  I left for an hour.
[7365.91s -> 7366.63s]  What have I missed?
[7369.21s -> 7370.01s]  Not a whole lot.
[7370.97s -> 7374.09s]  Not a whole lot.
[7374.09s -> 7374.57s]  All right.
[7375.37s -> 7376.81s]  Watchdog's Legion.
[7376.81s -> 7377.45s]  Here we go.
[7377.45s -> 7381.02s]  I'm going to get that 3090.
[7381.02s -> 7382.06s]  I'm going to get like a...
[7382.06s -> 7385.10s]  I'm going to get like a 35-core PC.
[7385.10s -> 7386.54s]  A 3090.
[7386.54s -> 7388.70s]  Two of them.
[7388.70s -> 7389.82s]  I'm going to have to have
[7389.82s -> 7392.78s]  a dedicated energy account
[7392.78s -> 7393.66s]  just for this computer.
[7393.66s -> 7394.62s]  I swear to God.
[7394.62s -> 7396.18s]  You lost 2,000 viewers.
[7396.18s -> 7396.50s]  Sorry.
[7396.50s -> 7397.94s]  They'll be back in like 10 minutes.
[7397.94s -> 7406.84s]  OK.
[7406.84s -> 7408.20s]  We have restarted.
[7409.14s -> 7411.94s]  I have dropped my stream settings
[7411.94s -> 7414.34s]  to be able to handle this.
[7414.34s -> 7416.50s]  The game has been restarted.
[7416.50s -> 7417.22s]  I'm ready.
[7417.22s -> 7418.58s]  It's in DirectX 11.
[7422.26s -> 7423.30s]  I have the new driver.
[7423.30s -> 7425.46s]  I'm ready to play Watchdog's Legion
[7425.46s -> 7426.58s]  on launch day.
[7426.58s -> 7429.22s]  We're on V-Sync, you idiot.
[7431.74s -> 7432.86s]  Isn't turning on V-Sync
[7432.86s -> 7435.18s]  the same thing as like saying Voldemort?
[7436.06s -> 7437.58s]  I thought all gamers on PC
[7437.58s -> 7438.70s]  weren't allowed to do that.
[7438.70s -> 7442.18s]  Here we go.
[7442.18s -> 7443.06s]  Let's take a look.
[7443.06s -> 7443.38s]  OK.
[7445.35s -> 7451.02s]  Continue.
[7451.02s -> 7451.26s]  Wait.
[7451.26s -> 7451.82s]  I'll do it.
[7451.82s -> 7452.06s]  OK.
[7452.06s -> 7452.78s]  Let me do that first.
[7454.92s -> 7455.40s]  Video.
[7456.52s -> 7458.50s]  Full screen.
[7458.50s -> 7458.98s]  V-Sync.
[7459.94s -> 7460.34s]  Normal.
[7461.35s -> 7461.91s]  I guess.
[7461.91s -> 7462.31s]  OK.
[7462.31s -> 7462.71s]  Normal.
[7465.50s -> 7465.90s]  Here we go.
[7467.40s -> 7467.88s]  Campaign.
[7468.44s -> 7469.32s]  Continue.
[7469.32s -> 7470.15s]  Let's go.
[7499.64s -> 7499.88s]  Hey.
[7503.91s -> 7504.47s]  All right.
[7508.94s -> 7510.22s]  It looks just as bad
[7510.22s -> 7517.82s]  as it did 20 minutes ago.
[7517.82s -> 7519.74s]  Dude, why is it doing this?
[7520.30s -> 7532.28s]  Wait, are we good?
[7532.28s -> 7532.52s]  No.
[7538.74s -> 7541.22s]  My computer can't handle Watchdog's Legion.
[7541.22s -> 7542.02s]  I can't.
[7542.02s -> 7543.40s]  I just can't do it.
[7543.40s -> 7545.24s]  My CPU can't run it.
[7545.24s -> 7546.68s]  I can't run it.
[7546.68s -> 7550.49s]  I can run it on DX12.
[7558.15s -> 7558.71s]  No.
[7558.71s -> 7560.55s]  I don't want to do this again.
[7561.11s -> 7561.99s]  DX12.
[7561.99s -> 7562.71s]  And I'm going to put like
[7562.71s -> 7564.47s]  the geometry on high.
[7564.47s -> 7572.58s]  Don't restart yet.
[7572.58s -> 7572.90s]  Hold on.
[7574.87s -> 7576.39s]  Resolution is 1080.
[7576.39s -> 7586.23s]  It's the PC patch, not your PC.
[7586.23s -> 7587.19s]  What the fuck?
[7587.19s -> 7589.82s]  Go to 720.
[7589.82s -> 7590.78s]  No, that's too ugly.
[7590.78s -> 7591.50s]  I can't.
[7591.50s -> 7594.57s]  Turn off V-Sync.
[7594.57s -> 7594.81s]  All right.
[7594.81s -> 7595.77s]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[7595.77s -> 7598.92s]  I'm going to go back to DX Revert.
[7598.92s -> 7601.40s]  Let's go back to DX12.
[7601.40s -> 7603.18s]  I'm going to put the geometry.
[7603.18s -> 7603.98s]  I'm going to keep this here.
[7605.22s -> 7605.54s]  Everything.
[7606.74s -> 7610.26s]  We're going to put some load on the GPU.
[7612.87s -> 7613.59s]  Major load.
[7613.59s -> 7615.83s]  No, I don't want major load on the CPU.
[7615.83s -> 7620.26s]  Why does my CPU suck?
[7623.22s -> 7628.22s]  My CPU doesn't even suck, though.
[7628.38s -> 7631.34s]  I have a 6-core, like 6,800.
[7637.34s -> 7638.14s]  If this don't work,
[7638.14s -> 7639.26s]  if this still looks like shit,
[7639.26s -> 7640.70s]  then I'm just going to do tier lists
[7640.70s -> 7642.22s]  for like two or three hours.
[7642.22s -> 7644.23s]  Get them ready.
[7644.23s -> 7645.51s]  Get your favorite tier lists ready
[7645.51s -> 7646.87s]  because Watch Dogs Legion
[7646.87s -> 7648.79s]  fucking throw it into the trash.
[7648.79s -> 7671.53s]  Here we go.
[7671.53s -> 7673.29s]  Six cores, not enough in 2020.
[7673.29s -> 7674.41s]  That's plenty of cores.
[7674.41s -> 7675.45s]  That's a lot of cores.
[7675.45s -> 7676.81s]  I just got $50 for like
[7676.81s -> 7678.49s]  the worst stream I've done all month.
[7678.49s -> 7684.33s]  It's from Phylactery Lich.
[7684.33s -> 7686.15s]  Thank you, Phylactery.
[7686.15s -> 7687.67s]  5,000 bits.
[7687.67s -> 7689.50s]  Remember, please buy a new computer.
[7689.50s -> 7690.54s]  I'm begging you.
[7690.54s -> 7691.98s]  Yeah, I am.
[7692.46s -> 7695.38s]  I just was waiting until like 3090s
[7695.38s -> 7697.06s]  and 3080s were back in stock
[7697.06s -> 7699.94s]  and the new Risen processors just dropped.
[7699.94s -> 7701.78s]  This shit's happening like this weekend.
[7701.78s -> 7702.66s]  Like I'm this day.
[7702.66s -> 7708.73s]  I'm going to get a supercomputer.
[7708.73s -> 7710.25s]  I'm coming back to Watch Dogs Legion
[7710.25s -> 7711.05s]  when I get this new computer
[7711.05s -> 7712.25s]  and we're going to put everything on Ultra
[7712.25s -> 7712.89s]  and I'm just going to run around
[7712.89s -> 7714.25s]  and just punch people and laugh
[7714.25s -> 7715.77s]  and say, see where we are.
[7715.77s -> 7716.89s]  All right, let's try it.
[7716.89s -> 7718.23s]  Get your tier lists ready
[7718.23s -> 7720.39s]  because I'm about to fucking have a meltdown.
[7720.39s -> 7736.31s]  What about AI Dungeon?
[7736.31s -> 7737.27s]  Well, maybe.
[7737.27s -> 7755.05s]  You made your, uh, put,
[7755.05s -> 7755.93s]  went down to 70.
[7756.81s -> 7761.29s]  Just try and stop me.
[7761.29s -> 7762.25s]  Okay. Well, it runs.
[7764.71s -> 7766.39s]  It runs, but not very good.
[7771.13s -> 7773.05s]  I fucking swear to God.
[7773.05s -> 7775.94s]  Dude, this ain't my computer.
[7775.94s -> 7777.06s]  This ain't my computer.
[7777.06s -> 7777.62s]  It's not.
[7777.62s -> 7778.34s]  This is no way.
[7778.34s -> 7779.22s]  That's not my computer.
[7779.22s -> 7780.50s]  This is fucking dumb game.
[7781.70s -> 7783.78s]  There's no fucking way this is my PC.
[7794.17s -> 7795.53s]  He's in denial.
[7795.53s -> 7796.65s]  No, it can't be.
[7798.47s -> 7800.47s]  No, other streamers are good.
[7800.47s -> 7801.03s]  But why?
[7801.03s -> 7802.47s]  Why am I not good?
[7802.47s -> 7803.67s]  Why am I not good?
[7804.23s -> 7805.86s]  What the heck?
[7805.86s -> 7807.22s]  It's not fair.
[7807.22s -> 7808.74s]  I was supposed to be number two.
[7808.74s -> 7809.94s]  I was the number two guy.
[7809.94s -> 7810.74s]  He was supposed to be me.
[7811.46s -> 7817.22s]  Put it on XP compatibility mode.
[7821.46s -> 7821.78s]  Fuck.
[7822.50s -> 7823.94s]  It was supposed to be me, you know?
[7823.94s -> 7824.98s]  I was supposed to be that guy.
[7824.98s -> 7826.98s]  I was supposed to be the number two spot.
[7826.98s -> 7828.81s]  I was going to be able to look over
[7828.81s -> 7830.25s]  and see like Shroud right there
[7830.25s -> 7832.97s]  and be like, Shroud, Pog.
[7832.97s -> 7834.41s]  This stream looks so good too.
[7834.41s -> 7836.57s]  And I need like a good stream like his.
[7836.57s -> 7836.89s]  All right.
[7837.45s -> 7840.90s]  I'm doing this one more time.
[7840.90s -> 7850.76s]  I have to try one more time.
[7850.76s -> 7851.72s]  Why? Why?
[7851.72s -> 7853.72s]  Because it's called, I've, okay.
[7853.80s -> 7859.21s]  I lost $99,999.
[7859.21s -> 7865.19s]  I have $1 left and I'm putting it on black.
[7865.19s -> 7867.03s]  And if it hits, then I get $2.
[7868.09s -> 7880.54s]  And at least I got a victory out of this.
[7880.54s -> 7881.58s]  You're in denial.
[7881.58s -> 7882.14s]  I know.
[7882.14s -> 7883.10s]  That's okay though.
[7883.10s -> 7886.15s]  But okay, here's the really wacky thing, okay?
[7886.95s -> 7890.87s]  My CPU usage right now is like 19%.
[7890.87s -> 7892.84s]  What the hell's happening?
[7893.90s -> 7897.21s]  This is not like putting a bottleneck on my computer.
[7897.21s -> 7898.25s]  This is wacky shit.
[7898.25s -> 7900.25s]  My CPU is at 22% right now.
[7900.33s -> 7903.59s]  This is wacky shit.
[7903.59s -> 7904.55s]  Don't you think?
[7904.55s -> 7914.12s]  I want to see what it is.
[7920.86s -> 7921.90s]  It's zany.
[7921.90s -> 7923.10s]  Oh, Twitch staff is here.
[7923.10s -> 7924.46s]  I'm going to be on good behavior.
[7933.58s -> 7934.86s]  If you use liquid, what?
[7935.42s -> 7938.20s]  Open up a benchmark.
[7938.20s -> 7946.54s]  It's because you have a pirated copy of the game.
[7949.10s -> 7950.22s]  That's what I was doing.
[7951.70s -> 7955.14s]  You guys know how many like subs this channel has
[7955.14s -> 7957.62s]  and I'm pirating Watch Dogs Legion.
[7960.30s -> 7961.58s]  I don't want to risk too much.
[7975.02s -> 7975.42s]  Okay.
[7975.42s -> 7976.38s]  Nobody move.
[7976.86s -> 7977.50s]  I'm not going to move.
[7982.92s -> 7983.24s]  Okay.
[7984.87s -> 7986.47s]  By the way, view count rising.
[7987.35s -> 7989.27s]  View count rising.
[7989.27s -> 7989.83s]  Bye.
[7989.83s -> 7990.79s]  Everybody stop buying.
[7991.35s -> 7992.31s]  Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.
[7994.30s -> 8004.97s]  View count fucking skyrocketing.
[8004.97s -> 8005.29s]  All right.
[8005.29s -> 8005.77s]  I can play.
[8007.61s -> 8007.85s]  All right.
[8007.85s -> 8008.09s]  We're good.
[8008.09s -> 8008.41s]  We're good.
[8008.41s -> 8008.73s]  We're good.
[8008.73s -> 8009.45s]  We're good.
[8009.45s -> 8009.85s]  Let's go.
[8023.10s -> 8024.14s]  It works, right?
[8024.14s -> 8025.10s]  We got decent frames.
[8033.08s -> 8034.12s]  We got decent frames.
[8034.12s -> 8036.28s]  It just looks like dog shit.
[8036.92s -> 8043.88s]  Employer.
[8043.88s -> 8046.20s]  And aside from some heavily armed security guards,
[8046.20s -> 8047.64s]  it's basically a ghost town.
[8047.64s -> 8049.56s]  Decent frames, but at what cost?
[8049.56s -> 8049.80s]  All right.
[8049.80s -> 8050.20s]  We're good.
[8050.20s -> 8050.36s]  We're good.
[8050.36s -> 8050.68s]  We're good.
[8050.68s -> 8050.84s]  Let's go.
[8050.84s -> 8051.32s]  Let's go.
[8051.32s -> 8051.72s]  I'm ready.
[8051.72s -> 8052.12s]  I'm playing.
[8057.83s -> 8058.55s]  Okay.
[8058.55s -> 8059.43s]  Restricted area.
[8059.43s -> 8060.47s]  Investigate the replacement.
[8061.03s -> 8067.14s]  Take a look at security cameras.
[8067.14s -> 8068.26s]  Time to hack the world.
[8069.45s -> 8070.25s]  Hack the world.
[8071.05s -> 8072.89s]  Only if you have a graphics card
[8072.89s -> 8076.33s]  that's at least in the 2000 generation of Nvidia.
[8076.33s -> 8078.49s]  You got anything less than that?
[8078.49s -> 8080.17s]  You don't get to hack the world.
[8080.17s -> 8083.61s]  Well, you do, but you get to kind of slowly get to hack the world.
[8084.25s -> 8088.73s]  Pretty bad frames.
[8094.94s -> 8095.58s]  Huge bits.
[8096.14s -> 8099.50s]  Hey, Master Fleet, thanks for the $50 for the PC fund.
[8100.54s -> 8100.94s]  Don't worry.
[8100.94s -> 8101.66s]  I'm going to get one.
[8108.23s -> 8109.11s]  I'm going to take this guy down.
[8109.75s -> 8113.61s]  Thank you for the $50 of this insane amount of money.
[8114.25s -> 8115.77s]  Can I kick this thing when it's on the ground?
[8116.41s -> 8120.95s]  Who the fuck is this?
[8133.13s -> 8135.21s]  You know when you just get taken out of a groove
[8135.21s -> 8139.13s]  because you spent the last 40 minutes trying to get the game to run?
[8139.69s -> 8151.00s]  What the hell was that?
[8151.00s -> 8151.56s]  Nice trip.
[8152.12s -> 8162.50s]  I fucking hate the drones.
[8162.50s -> 8163.46s]  The drones are stupid.
[8163.46s -> 8164.58s]  What a dumb thing to have in the game.
[8185.30s -> 8185.86s]  Sit down!
[8186.58s -> 8187.30s]  You too.
[8187.30s -> 8188.50s]  Who—this is like a CEO.
[8188.50s -> 8189.30s]  Who the fuck is this?
[8189.30s -> 8200.18s]  I don't know, battery power?
[8202.73s -> 8206.41s]  Dude, I haven't even done the first mission of the game.
[8206.41s -> 8206.97s]  I'm realizing.
[8206.97s -> 8209.69s]  This is just like hard mode secondary shit.
[8209.69s -> 8211.37s]  I need to do the actual mission.
[8214.38s -> 8215.26s]  What the fuck?
[8218.07s -> 8219.19s]  I can't even do this!
[8225.00s -> 8226.04s]  Get out of my face.
[8226.04s -> 8238.62s]  You fuckin' tin can?
[8238.62s -> 8239.86s]  High disadvantage, what?
[8239.86s -> 8241.78s]  Wait, open that back up.
[8241.78s -> 8246.42s]  Open that back up.
[8246.42s -> 8251.15s]  Go, go, go, get it, get it.
[8251.15s -> 8253.39s]  Who needs advanced hacking when you have
[8253.39s -> 8260.84s]  idiots that open doors for free?
[8260.84s -> 8276.17s]  God damn it.
[8276.17s -> 8280.26s]  I'm good.
[8280.26s -> 8283.63s]  Like that, where are they?
[8283.63s -> 8286.78s]  You can do your corporate espionage from there.
[8286.78s -> 8295.38s]  Oh my god, there's a person here.
[8295.38s -> 8306.75s]  Shoot him, what?
[8306.75s -> 8312.03s]  What's that, what's that, what's it on me?
[8312.03s -> 8313.03s]  Hey, what's that on your phone?
[8313.03s -> 8323.70s]  Somebody just sent you a funny meme on the internet.
[8323.70s -> 8333.35s]  Okay, get out of here.
[8333.35s -> 8337.93s]  Hack it, hack this, hack this thing.
[8337.93s -> 8339.53s]  Hack it, is it just me, is it just me?
[8339.53s -> 8340.73s]  Fuck, what?
[8340.73s -> 8354.56s]  Download, all right, downloading it, 5%.
[8354.56s -> 8366.54s]  Oh, look at that view count, skyrocketing.
[8366.54s -> 8367.78s]  What's wrong with this?
[8367.78s -> 8370.42s]  Oh, this thing is sad, this is sad.
[8373.59s -> 8375.27s]  I had to put it out of its misery.
[8375.27s -> 8386.66s]  It was flying around.
[8386.66s -> 8390.94s]  I did it, okay.
[8390.94s -> 8405.43s]  Uh-oh, I don't think, I can't leave.
[8405.43s -> 8413.51s]  Wait, wait, wait, I'm good, I got it.
[8413.51s -> 8434.30s]  Thank god I can do it from inside.
[8434.34s -> 8436.38s]  Oh, we're out.
[8436.38s -> 8437.54s]  See, this game's not bad.
[8437.54s -> 8439.74s]  Look at this, this is a fun, cool thing I just did.
[8439.74s -> 8448.44s]  What do we have?
[8448.44s -> 8453.67s]  It could maybe replace a few million humans at most.
[8453.67s -> 8455.97s]  I suppose from your perspective, that's a lot.
[8455.97s -> 8457.25s]  If you like, we can go destroy it
[8457.25s -> 8459.65s]  before it puts anyone else out of work.
[8459.65s -> 8462.29s]  Very good, forward me the coordinates.
[8462.29s -> 8465.48s]  All right, I got it, we're good.
[8465.48s -> 8467.82s]  Now, okay, now I'm gonna do a mission.
[8467.82s -> 8469.00s]  Let's go do a real mission,
[8469.00s -> 8471.80s]  not one of these fake missions, a real one.
[8471.80s -> 8481.38s]  Here we go, recruit Seth Den, that's not a real mission.
[8481.38s -> 8485.82s]  Here it is, track this, please.
[8485.82s -> 8486.66s]  What are my skill points?
[8486.66s -> 8489.48s]  Hell yeah, let's go.
[8489.48s -> 8491.82s]  Here's my team.
[8491.82s -> 8493.98s]  What does he got?
[8493.98s -> 8499.78s]  New operative, I can, oh, I can switch to this operative.
[8499.78s -> 8509.85s]  This guy dead?
[8509.85s -> 8516.25s]  All right, I'm good for now.
[8516.25s -> 8541.86s]  You beat his ass and now he wants to be on the team.
[8541.86s -> 8549.06s]  What is this, hold on, there's tech points in here.
[8549.06s -> 8555.57s]  Let's see, oh, wait, recruitment.
[8555.57s -> 8569.59s]  No, no, no, no more recruitments.
[8569.59s -> 8572.59s]  Can I get on stage?
[8572.59s -> 8590.84s]  Oh, free money, this, this.
[8590.84s -> 8595.39s]  Oops, okay, what am I doing?
[8595.39s -> 8596.51s]  Okay, mission.
[8596.51s -> 8603.73s]  Sir, I'm gonna need you to pull over that car, please.
[8603.73s -> 8611.59s]  Somebody, what?
[8611.59s -> 8613.99s]  This thing zips, holy shit, look at this thing.
[8621.14s -> 8624.59s]  All right, raise it.
[8624.59s -> 8638.00s]  What do you mean checkpoint?
[8638.00s -> 8640.26s]  All right, I'll be on operations data.
[8640.26s -> 8642.46s]  I'll be in propaganda, let's do mission one.
[8656.59s -> 8668.76s]  Now this is pod racing.
[8668.76s -> 8672.63s]  In here, all right, get me out of this.
[8672.63s -> 8675.66s]  Sneak into this place.
[8675.66s -> 8677.68s]  You just taking a picture of me?
[8677.68s -> 8680.37s]  Taking photos of me?
[8680.37s -> 8682.69s]  All right, this is restricted.
[8682.69s -> 8686.48s]  Get operations data and get the propaganda.
[8686.48s -> 8688.86s]  Restricted areas are dangerous.
[8688.86s -> 8691.89s]  Press V to scan the area to reveal scouting opportunities.
[8691.89s -> 8695.58s]  I'm glad I got this tutorial now.
[8695.58s -> 8696.98s]  Captains will call for reinforcements
[8696.98s -> 8701.61s]  if they detect you, eliminate them before they do.
[8701.61s -> 8703.65s]  Ammos, drones, traps, got it.
[8703.65s -> 8705.77s]  Albion have established an operational base
[8705.77s -> 8707.25s]  in the Royal Court of Justice.
[8707.25s -> 8708.09s]  Up there.
[8708.09s -> 8709.73s]  First they take over the justice system,
[8709.73s -> 8710.63s]  then they move in.
[8710.63s -> 8712.49s]  So much for rule of law.
[8712.49s -> 8713.93s]  Exactly.
[8713.93s -> 8714.77s]  Should I download some?
[8714.77s -> 8716.45s]  There's information here about how Albion
[8716.45s -> 8719.45s]  are targeting dissenters, the who and the why.
[8719.45s -> 8720.97s]  I love this PS2 game.
[8720.97s -> 8723.97s]  Me too, it's very fun.
[8724.77s -> 8725.61s]  All right, what is that?
[8725.61s -> 8729.00s]  Is that a GTX 3090?
[8729.00s -> 8733.94s]  Is somebody talking to me?
[8733.94s -> 8734.86s]  All right, I definitely have to do that.
[8734.86s -> 8739.46s]  Let's go up there.
[8739.46s -> 8742.01s]  Can I do anything with this?
[8742.01s -> 8743.01s]  Can't download that from here.
[8743.01s -> 8747.91s]  I can't fuck with this from here.
[8747.91s -> 8749.77s]  Oh, I can do that.
[8749.77s -> 8759.83s]  Hi Jack, this is a mouse trap?
[8759.83s -> 8761.60s]  What else you got?
[8761.60s -> 8763.32s]  Got him.
[8763.32s -> 8764.14s]  Only one guy left.
[8764.14s -> 8772.71s]  Anybody else in here?
[8772.71s -> 8774.20s]  This guy.
[8774.20s -> 8777.97s]  Got him.
[8777.97s -> 8778.79s]  Okay.
[8778.79s -> 8779.93s]  I think we're clear.
[8779.93s -> 8782.46s]  I can go in now, right?
[8782.46s -> 8783.30s]  I don't see anybody else.
[8783.30s -> 8784.30s]  All right, there's a guy here.
[8784.30s -> 8785.14s]  All right, wait, hold on.
[8785.14s -> 8797.69s]  Distract you, go in.
[8797.69s -> 8800.05s]  There ain't nobody else, right?
[8800.81s -> 8801.65s]  All right, there's the power source.
[8801.65s -> 8805.23s]  We're gonna turn the power on.
[8805.23s -> 8812.76s]  Everybody's dead, I'm fine.
[8812.76s -> 8814.80s]  Play Batman Arkham Asylum.
[8814.80s -> 8816.84s]  I beat that game on the hardest difficulty five times
[8816.84s -> 8817.98s]  and I was like 20.
[8817.98s -> 8820.91s]  No.
[8820.91s -> 8836.51s]  And if you believe that, then you're a sucker.
[8836.51s -> 8838.78s]  Shit!
[8838.78s -> 8841.59s]  You take two headshots?
[8841.59s -> 8842.43s]  Nobody, right?
[8842.43s -> 8845.62s]  Wait, I got it, it's fine.
[8845.62s -> 8853.19s]  Get that data.
[8853.19s -> 8859.30s]  Put your head up.
[8859.30s -> 8864.28s]  See, first mission done, I got it.
[8864.28s -> 8868.28s]  That was a challenge?
[8868.28s -> 8871.80s]  What, that was a challenge mode?
[8871.80s -> 8873.73s]  No, I wanted to do the mission.
[8873.73s -> 8875.21s]  Bagley, what do we have?
[8875.21s -> 8877.97s]  A list of what Aldian consider high value targets
[8877.97s -> 8880.81s]  that are threats to the peaceful running of London.
[8880.81s -> 8881.65s]  See here?
[8881.65s -> 8882.47s]  A journalist.
[8882.47s -> 8884.61s]  And this one runs a community shelter.
[8884.61s -> 8885.45s]  Good God.
[8885.45s -> 8889.00s]  What are we gonna do?
[8889.00s -> 8890.28s]  Okay.
[8890.28s -> 8891.72s]  This is across the whole city.
[8900.66s -> 8901.98s]  This is still the tutorial.
[8902.18s -> 8903.02s]  Oh.
[8909.26s -> 8910.18s]  Gadgets are useful.
[8910.18s -> 8912.67s]  I'm sure they are.
[8915.71s -> 8916.55s]  Gamers.
[8920.64s -> 8922.44s]  Oh, this is one of those games that runs good
[8922.44s -> 8924.12s]  when it becomes dusk.
[8924.12s -> 8925.04s]  It's one of those games.
[8925.04s -> 8927.46s]  Cool.
[8927.46s -> 8943.12s]  Press four.
[8943.12s -> 8945.68s]  There's essays in chat?
[8945.68s -> 8946.52s]  What are they saying?
[8946.52s -> 8947.56s]  Are they talking about me?
[8947.56s -> 8951.14s]  Are they making fun of me?
[8951.14s -> 8952.38s]  It really is GTA four.
[8952.38s -> 8957.16s]  This is not good.
[8957.16s -> 8964.13s]  It's actually like kind of worse than GTA four.
[8964.13s -> 8966.25s]  I need a new computer so bad.
[8966.25s -> 8967.65s]  It's not even funny anymore.
[8967.65s -> 8970.44s]  Like it was funny like two weeks ago.
[8970.44s -> 8981.72s]  Now it's like, get a new computer.
[8981.72s -> 8982.96s]  Saints Row three.
[8982.96s -> 8989.97s]  You know, I was gonna play Saints Row two like last week.
[8989.97s -> 8996.16s]  This runs bad on a 3090.
[8996.16s -> 8997.84s]  Why do I feel like that's the norm?
[9001.64s -> 9002.92s]  I've lost control of the car.
[9002.92s -> 9018.68s]  Okay.
[9018.68s -> 9019.76s]  All right.
[9019.76s -> 9025.27s]  In here, we have to disrupt the propaganda.
[9025.27s -> 9026.25s]  This is not restricted.
[9026.25s -> 9028.37s]  This is ATM.
[9029.21s -> 9030.05s]  Oh shit.
[9030.05s -> 9033.34s]  I just ATM money.
[9033.34s -> 9046.47s]  I'm not supposed to take it all.
[9046.47s -> 9054.59s]  Can I go in here?
[9054.59s -> 9057.92s]  I don't fuck with a gamer.
[9057.92s -> 9060.72s]  That's what I said.
[9060.72s -> 9064.48s]  Those Albian pricks putting their ugly stamp on everything.
[9064.48s -> 9066.28s]  It makes me sick just looking at it.
[9066.28s -> 9067.12s]  You're in good hands.
[9067.12s -> 9069.08s]  It looks to be that much less once you're done here.
[9069.08s -> 9072.00s]  Let's give Camden a break from these eyesores.
[9072.00s -> 9073.08s]  On it.
[9073.08s -> 9076.44s]  All right, so I've changed the...
[9076.44s -> 9077.48s]  So we're gonna hack the thing
[9077.48s -> 9086.48s]  to make it look like it's ugly or something?
[9086.48s -> 9087.92s]  Propaganda.
[9087.92s -> 9089.24s]  Propaganda.
[9089.32s -> 9091.74s]  We have to disrupt the propaganda.
[9091.74s -> 9092.98s]  I didn't even hit you.
[9092.98s -> 9094.22s]  I didn't hit you, you're fine.
[9094.22s -> 9095.70s]  I didn't even hit you.
[9095.70s -> 9097.58s]  You did not get hit by that bike.
[9097.58s -> 9102.25s]  By the way, how do you feel about the government?
[9102.25s -> 9103.40s]  Get up.
[9103.40s -> 9106.52s]  I need to recruit you.
[9106.52s -> 9117.20s]  Nevermind.
[9117.20s -> 9118.04s]  This is it.
[9118.04s -> 9119.44s]  If you hijack that scissor lift,
[9119.44s -> 9121.16s]  you could use it to access the rooftop.
[9121.16s -> 9129.32s]  Okay, hijack.
[9129.32s -> 9137.81s]  Wait, don't I need to be in it first?
[9137.81s -> 9140.08s]  Get in it first.
[9140.08s -> 9141.56s]  Okay, let's go.
[9141.56s -> 9148.96s]  Hijack.
[9148.96s -> 9157.12s]  And how excited are you guys for Watch Dogs 3?
[9157.16s -> 9159.32s]  Wait, I'm not gonna be able to get back in this.
[9159.32s -> 9168.82s]  Who cares?
[9168.82s -> 9171.95s]  Ooh, tech.
[9171.95s -> 9172.79s]  He hates it.
[9172.79s -> 9175.44s]  No, I don't.
[9175.44s -> 9182.68s]  I don't hate it.
[9182.68s -> 9183.52s]  Furu.
[9183.52s -> 9185.16s]  No, don't say Furu.
[9185.16s -> 9191.07s]  Don't say Furu, they're watching.
[9191.07s -> 9197.82s]  What's that puke?
[9197.82s -> 9201.51s]  Can I go inside of this?
[9201.51s -> 9203.99s]  No, sorry, Nancy, you can't do that.
[9203.99s -> 9217.44s]  Nobody can do that.
[9217.44s -> 9219.75s]  All right, turn it off.
[9219.75s -> 9221.35s]  Congratulations, you've done the first mission
[9221.35s -> 9227.24s]  of Watch Dogs.
[9227.24s -> 9234.40s]  We shall never surrender.
[9234.40s -> 9240.34s]  Hey, it was me.
[9240.34s -> 9241.16s]  All right, I did it.
[9241.16s -> 9245.06s]  So now what?
[9245.74s -> 9246.82s]  I'll get people's attention.
[9246.82s -> 9249.54s]  Let them know someone is standing up to Albion.
[9249.54s -> 9252.42s]  Light the spark that they can stand up to.
[9252.42s -> 9255.62s]  If nothing else, it'll relieve their eye strain.
[9255.62s -> 9256.46s]  Where's my car?
[9256.46s -> 9258.69s]  There it is.
[9258.69s -> 9259.51s]  Mission started.
[9259.51s -> 9260.57s]  Clarion call.
[9263.84s -> 9265.96s]  We're already seeing results from what you've done.
[9265.96s -> 9267.04s]  That list we found.
[9267.04s -> 9267.88s]  Taxi.
[9267.88s -> 9270.56s]  News journalist in Camden who's been investigating Albion.
[9270.56s -> 9273.04s]  We reached out and he's got information that can help us.
[9273.04s -> 9274.08s]  Why is it drive?
[9275.44s -> 9276.28s]  Forward me the call.
[9276.28s -> 9278.26s]  What's wrong with this thing?
[9278.26s -> 9284.86s]  It's running over a box?
[9284.86s -> 9288.80s]  Oh, come on.
[9288.80s -> 9292.12s]  All right, goodbye, it was fun.
[9292.12s -> 9300.79s]  Meet with the dead second foreman.
[9300.79s -> 9302.65s]  I can do that.
[9302.65s -> 9303.49s]  What the shit now?
[9303.49s -> 9313.34s]  Why is this up?
[9313.34s -> 9316.11s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[9316.11s -> 9317.43s]  Yo, that car looks sick.
[9317.43s -> 9320.71s]  Yeah, it does.
[9320.71s -> 9322.19s]  This does kind of look like Batman, doesn't it?
[9322.19s -> 9330.07s]  Yeah, now that you say that, I can see it.
[9330.07s -> 9341.23s]  Okay, meet with the informant.
[9341.23s -> 9342.55s]  Don't run him over, don't run him over,
[9342.55s -> 9344.95s]  don't run him over, don't run him over.
[9344.95s -> 9346.46s]  Who's this guy?
[9346.46s -> 9349.27s]  Neil Brown stole Albion weapon schematics.
[9349.27s -> 9350.51s]  He knows how to summon drones
[9350.51s -> 9355.85s]  and he's got extra faction damage.
[9355.85s -> 9362.69s]  All right, he's a summoner?
[9362.69s -> 9366.09s]  A little birdie told me you needed help.
[9366.09s -> 9367.53s]  Even more money came in.
[9367.53s -> 9368.85s]  You can't believe someone else is.
[9368.85s -> 9369.69s]  Thought I was alive, right?
[9369.69s -> 9370.53s]  Holy shit, guys.
[9370.53s -> 9372.61s]  You're not doing much, just putting the word out, are you?
[9372.61s -> 9374.21s]  Devil X gave $50.
[9374.21s -> 9375.66s]  Someone has to, don't they?
[9375.66s -> 9378.10s]  I have Insomnia gave $50, back to back.
[9378.10s -> 9379.58s]  Almost got Clip finding this.
[9379.58s -> 9381.46s]  All of Albion's operational data for the entire system.
[9381.46s -> 9383.98s]  Actually good computer fund, and here's some money,
[9383.98s -> 9385.54s]  seed money for a better laptop
[9385.54s -> 9387.58s]  because you're playing on one, clearly.
[9387.62s -> 9389.46s]  You'll get no argument from me.
[9389.46s -> 9390.70s]  Here's a sample.
[9390.70s -> 9393.26s]  Albion's closed King's Cross for the public, right?
[9393.26s -> 9394.38s]  What people don't know is that-
[9394.38s -> 9395.22s]  It's gonna happen.
[9395.22s -> 9397.42s]  It's their logistic center, materials.
[9397.42s -> 9398.82s]  Dude, when I build this new computer.
[9398.82s -> 9400.50s]  A lot of it runs through there.
[9400.50s -> 9403.02s]  We're gonna do a super benchmark stream.
[9403.02s -> 9404.18s]  Put it out of commission
[9404.18s -> 9406.50s]  and you'll severely hamstring Albion's operations
[9406.50s -> 9407.34s]  here in Camden.
[9407.34s -> 9408.74s]  Hell, everywhere.
[9408.74s -> 9413.89s]  Then that's our move.
[9413.89s -> 9418.07s]  I'm gonna run this thing through the absolute, through hell.
[9418.07s -> 9432.17s]  Okay, no, don't kill him.
[9433.09s -> 9435.25s]  I've just seen a car drive out.
[9435.25s -> 9439.73s]  Like somebody finally got the car in the mall out.
[9439.73s -> 9448.24s]  Oh my God, he got the car out of the mall.
[9448.24s -> 9449.88s]  You bastard, I can't believe somebody
[9449.88s -> 9458.03s]  actually was able to do that.
[9458.03s -> 9460.31s]  And then one of the representatives from the mall is like,
[9460.31s -> 9463.15s]  well, I mean, this kind of was the point.
[9463.15s -> 9464.23s]  We left the keys in there.
[9464.23s -> 9468.18s]  We were just waiting for somebody to drive out of the,
[9468.18s -> 9472.62s]  out of the JCPenney.
[9472.62s -> 9479.39s]  It's just a free car.
[9479.39s -> 9482.09s]  I just went in a circle.
[9482.09s -> 9483.77s]  Holy shit.
[9483.77s -> 9484.61s]  What did I just run over?
[9484.61s -> 9485.45s]  What did I just run over?
[9485.45s -> 9486.81s]  What did I just run over?
[9486.81s -> 9487.65s]  What'd I hit?
[9494.90s -> 9496.90s]  That was a camp.
[9496.90s -> 9497.90s]  Jesus Christ.
[9505.65s -> 9506.49s]  Jesus.
[9515.46s -> 9517.70s]  Okay, we can get a drone.
[9517.70s -> 9523.00s]  Hijack a news drone.
[9523.00s -> 9524.78s]  Okay.
[9524.78s -> 9525.62s]  Hijack.
[9527.82s -> 9529.46s]  Up, down, flash.
[9531.34s -> 9532.86s]  Find the information generator.
[9537.47s -> 9539.55s]  I'll go spotlight, turn that off.
[9539.55s -> 9540.39s]  Oh, hey.
[9540.39s -> 9542.19s]  Oh shit, drone fight.
[9542.19s -> 9547.74s]  Drone fight.
[9547.74s -> 9555.15s]  Okay, out of here.
[9555.15s -> 9556.39s]  Photograph the generator.
[9556.39s -> 9565.59s]  What happened?
[9565.59s -> 9570.87s]  Just use cover.
[9570.87s -> 9571.87s]  All right, there's the schematics.
[9571.87s -> 9574.01s]  Photograph it.
[9574.01s -> 9578.22s]  How many do I need?
[9578.22s -> 9579.42s]  F.
[9583.30s -> 9593.33s]  Okay, download the detonation code.
[9593.33s -> 9594.17s]  Fuck.
[9594.33s -> 9603.15s]  Okay, just wave.
[9603.15s -> 9609.97s]  Fuck, wave.
[9609.97s -> 9612.26s]  Got it.
[9612.26s -> 9623.66s]  Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, hack.
[9623.66s -> 9628.26s]  47%, 50%, 55%, 60%.
[9628.26s -> 9637.62s]  We almost loaded the game.
[9637.62s -> 9638.46s]  Hack faster.
[9638.46s -> 9639.54s]  I'm going as fast as I can.
[9639.54s -> 9640.38s]  That's it.
[9640.38s -> 9641.58s]  Use the code on the generator
[9641.58s -> 9643.38s]  and I can trigger a power surge.
[9643.38s -> 9644.54s]  All right, go back to the generator.
[9644.54s -> 9651.25s]  Stack King's cross offline and the rail system too.
[9651.25s -> 9653.73s]  Is this exhilarating?
[9653.73s -> 9654.97s]  Is it?
[9654.97s -> 9664.57s]  Wait, should I go flash this guy in the face?
[9664.57s -> 9667.82s]  Did I leave?
[9667.82s -> 9677.70s]  Oh shit, it exploded.
[9677.70s -> 9690.37s]  That was you, oh.
[9690.37s -> 9693.37s]  We got a gold mine of information out of St. Pancras.
[9693.37s -> 9696.93s]  Albion convoys, informants, gear, you name it.
[9696.93s -> 9699.45s]  Everything we need to ignite the people of London,
[9699.45s -> 9701.21s]  like we did in Camden.
[9701.21s -> 9702.73s]  Derail Albion's operations
[9702.73s -> 9706.69s]  and give the people a reason to rise up borough by borough.
[9706.69s -> 9708.29s]  The more we do that,
[9708.29s -> 9710.41s]  the more we'll get allies flocking to the courts.
[9710.41s -> 9711.29s]  City of London.
[9711.29s -> 9714.21s]  We'll show London that DedSec is here for them.
[9714.21s -> 9716.33s]  London was mine?
[9716.33s -> 9721.30s]  What do you mean?
[9721.30s -> 9723.02s]  That was off the chain, mate.
[9723.02s -> 9726.08s]  I knew DedSec weren't the bad guys Albion was saying.
[9726.08s -> 9727.96s]  London was fine.
[9727.96s -> 9728.80s]  Thanks.
[9728.80s -> 9729.64s]  Thanks.
[9729.64s -> 9730.48s]  Now that you've shown the borough
[9730.48s -> 9732.56s]  what DedSec is really all about,
[9732.56s -> 9734.12s]  there are gonna be folks wanting to join up.
[9734.12s -> 9736.76s]  A lot of people have been looking for a way to fight back.
[9736.76s -> 9739.52s]  Let me have the title of my stream make sense, finally.
[9739.52s -> 9741.18s]  I'll contact you very soon.
[9741.18s -> 9742.78s]  I happen to know they're champion at the bit.
[9742.78s -> 9745.33s]  At this point, I think we'll take all cover.
[9745.33s -> 9753.46s]  DedSec needs people.
[9753.46s -> 9757.84s]  Spray, what, what is this, around my hair?
[9757.84s -> 9759.48s]  DedSec support complete borough activities
[9759.48s -> 9761.40s]  to increase DedSec support.
[9761.40s -> 9762.68s]  You get tech points.
[9762.68s -> 9763.88s]  Skilled recruits have abilities
[9763.88s -> 9766.85s]  or weapons that are valuable to DedSec.
[9766.85s -> 9768.13s]  When a borough becomes defiant,
[9768.13s -> 9770.57s]  a skilled recruit will be added to the team.
[9770.57s -> 9771.41s]  You got it.
[9771.41s -> 9772.29s]  All right, let's go find an old lady
[9772.29s -> 9779.58s]  and ask her if she wants to join.
[9779.58s -> 9780.42s]  Wait, what?
[9780.42s -> 9785.70s]  Who did I recruit?
[9785.70s -> 9787.06s]  Game doesn't normally look this bad.
[9787.06s -> 9788.22s]  Well, it only, it does when you put it
[9788.22s -> 9790.40s]  on the lowest settings
[9790.40s -> 9791.80s]  because it's the only way you can play it.
[9791.80s -> 9793.36s]  There's a lot of potential in you.
[9793.36s -> 9795.50s]  I trust you won't disappoint.
[9795.50s -> 9798.42s]  I must say, I'm rather looking forward to the experience.
[9798.42s -> 9800.58s]  Let's go hunt some baddies.
[9801.50s -> 9813.02s]  Recruit a kid.
[9813.02s -> 9814.10s]  Me, you're still alive.
[9814.10s -> 9815.30s]  I also have been a tenner.
[9815.30s -> 9816.14s]  Not only that.
[9816.14s -> 9817.78s]  Every time we switch,
[9817.78s -> 9819.34s]  the last person has to die.
[9819.34s -> 9821.32s]  So now I spy with a vertical eye.
[9821.32s -> 9824.74s]  We're just jumping hosts.
[9824.74s -> 9825.74s]  What is it?
[9825.74s -> 9828.94s]  The Signals Intelligence Response Service or SIRS
[9828.94s -> 9830.66s]  or the Earl Grey Gestapo
[9830.66s -> 9832.14s]  have developed a surveillance technology
[9832.14s -> 9834.02s]  called AR reconstruction.
[9834.02s -> 9836.70s]  It's the leading edge of privacy rights violation
[9836.70s -> 9837.98s]  and thus it could be very useful
[9837.98s -> 9839.74s]  in our attempts to find Zero Day.
[9840.58s -> 9843.78s]  It's just a symbiont.
[9843.78s -> 9847.90s]  I don't like this human sheath anymore.
[9847.90s -> 9849.30s]  All right, we need to find an old lady.
[9849.30s -> 9850.58s]  Old lady.
[9850.58s -> 9851.42s]  Nope.
[9851.42s -> 9852.42s]  Whoa.
[9852.42s -> 9853.70s]  It just barely touched.
[9853.70s -> 9857.06s]  Yeah.
[9857.06s -> 9860.98s]  You're all right, we're fine.
[9860.98s -> 9870.86s]  Old lady, old lady, old lady.
[9870.86s -> 9872.15s]  Old lady.
[9872.15s -> 9873.49s]  Nope.
[9873.49s -> 9874.31s]  Old lady.
[9874.31s -> 9883.58s]  Nope.
[9883.58s -> 9890.57s]  We'll find the queen.
[9890.57s -> 9891.41s]  Or whatever.
[9891.41s -> 9902.90s]  We're a new operative now.
[9902.90s -> 9908.40s]  I'm just keeping my eye out for old ladies.
[9908.40s -> 9909.64s]  Just auto drive and look around.
[9909.64s -> 9914.35s]  Auto drive now enabled.
[9914.35s -> 9920.55s]  All right.
[9921.35s -> 9922.43s]  Nope, don't see any.
[9922.43s -> 9925.88s]  Nope.
[9925.88s -> 9928.25s]  Looking for old ladies.
[9928.25s -> 9934.58s]  The older the better.
[9934.58s -> 9940.73s]  Old.
[9940.73s -> 9942.05s]  Oh, I saw the gameplay trailer.
[9942.05s -> 9947.15s]  I want to do it.
[9947.15s -> 9958.25s]  I want to see the gameplay trailer.
[9958.25s -> 9973.30s]  There's no old people in London?
[9973.30s -> 9974.22s]  It's a rare spawn.
[9974.22s -> 9977.73s]  An old lady's a rare spawn?
[9977.73s -> 9985.40s]  No.
[9985.40s -> 9986.88s]  Auto drive now disabled.
[9986.88s -> 9987.72s]  Nope.
[9987.72s -> 9990.78s]  I thought that was an old man.
[9990.78s -> 9999.96s]  Keep your eyes open.
[9999.96s -> 10001.53s]  Hello?
[10001.53s -> 10003.16s]  Excuse me.
[10003.16s -> 10006.45s]  I have a proposition for you.
[10006.45s -> 10010.14s]  I'm from...
[10010.14s -> 10011.74s]  Nah, I thought you were old.
[10011.74s -> 10012.58s]  Nevermind.
[10012.58s -> 10022.83s]  I thought you were somebody else.
[10022.83s -> 10025.42s]  Not old enough.
[10025.42s -> 10026.26s]  Excuse me.
[10026.26s -> 10028.74s]  Jesus, come on, dude.
[10028.74s -> 10047.26s]  Get out of the way.
[10047.26s -> 10057.90s]  I'm slowly going over to the new mission too, by the way.
[10057.90s -> 10060.96s]  Old.
[10060.96s -> 10064.66s]  Instruction worker.
[10064.66s -> 10070.87s]  No, where are the old ladies?
[10070.87s -> 10071.91s]  All right.
[10071.91s -> 10072.75s]  I'm here.
[10072.75s -> 10074.75s]  In theory, the AR reconstruction
[10074.75s -> 10077.27s]  should allow me to use various sources of surveillance data
[10077.27s -> 10078.99s]  to rebuild past events.
[10078.99s -> 10079.83s]  Access a data...
[10079.83s -> 10080.67s]  AR tech.
[10080.67s -> 10081.87s]  ...scrape all the metadata for...
[10081.87s -> 10085.36s]  Can I get in this way?
[10085.36s -> 10087.00s]  No, I gotta go the other way.
[10087.00s -> 10095.22s]  Around the other side.
[10095.22s -> 10096.06s]  Casino.
[10096.06s -> 10100.76s]  Go to the casino.
[10100.76s -> 10113.40s]  Is there a casino in this game?
[10113.40s -> 10117.59s]  You old?
[10117.59s -> 10119.25s]  Excuse me, Emma.
[10119.25s -> 10127.14s]  I'd like to offer you a contract.
[10127.14s -> 10128.27s]  How are you?
[10128.27s -> 10129.87s]  How do you feel about the world right now?
[10129.87s -> 10133.30s]  Don't you feel like that you would want to become part of
[10133.30s -> 10137.99s]  something more?
[10137.99s -> 10141.33s]  Emma, I'd like to recruit you.
[10141.33s -> 10142.93s]  We have things to talk about.
[10142.93s -> 10144.97s]  Don't you think you want to be part of something more,
[10144.97s -> 10146.89s]  something bigger than yourself?
[10146.89s -> 10148.89s]  She's an activist who's been trying to gather intel
[10148.89s -> 10151.17s]  on Albion personnel movements through the city.
[10151.17s -> 10153.37s]  Looks like she wants to stay one step ahead of the goons.
[10153.37s -> 10154.37s]  Okay.
[10154.37s -> 10156.01s]  That is smart, yeah.
[10156.01s -> 10156.85s]  Let's help her.
[10156.85s -> 10158.29s]  Could turn into a nice little asset.
[10158.29s -> 10159.13s]  You're gonna...
[10159.13s -> 10159.97s]  A Ponzi scheme?
[10159.97s -> 10164.97s]  Look, you just have to sell 400 lipsticks and eye powders
[10167.13s -> 10169.53s]  every week and you'll make $40.
[10169.53s -> 10177.88s]  I'm telling you, it's the opportunity of a lifetime.
[10177.88s -> 10182.99s]  Okay, steal an Albion armored vehicle.
[10182.99s -> 10189.82s]  You got it.
[10189.82s -> 10191.34s]  Any armored vehicle, right?
[10191.34s -> 10201.57s]  Doesn't matter where.
[10201.57s -> 10204.74s]  You're blind, am I?
[10211.24s -> 10212.52s]  Fucking cartoon.
[10212.52s -> 10214.08s]  Tom and Jerry cartoon.
[10214.08s -> 10222.29s]  Can I play a game normally for once?
[10222.29s -> 10223.21s]  Oh, here's one.
[10230.04s -> 10231.08s]  Grandma, I got one.
[10236.92s -> 10237.76s]  I got it.
[10242.34s -> 10245.42s]  All of a sudden, a little tornado is gonna come pick me up
[10245.42s -> 10248.10s]  and I'm gonna get three tubes to pick to skip
[10248.10s -> 10264.90s]  a third of each portion of this game.
[10264.90s -> 10269.10s]  That's some deep reference right there.
[10269.14s -> 10272.26s]  And I feel bad for those who don't understand it.
[10272.26s -> 10282.60s]  That's a deep reference.
[10282.60s -> 10288.82s]  Wrong way.
[10288.82s -> 10291.86s]  It's not deep, it sucked.
[10291.86s -> 10296.64s]  But you just got yourself a timeout.
[10296.64s -> 10298.53s]  Next stream.
[10298.53s -> 10302.39s]  I'll remember your name.
[10302.39s -> 10304.71s]  Next stream, you're getting timed out.
[10304.71s -> 10305.55s]  You know what?
[10305.55s -> 10315.90s]  Who cares, run over.
[10315.90s -> 10316.74s]  I've got places to be.
[10316.74s -> 10321.90s]  I have an old lady to recruit.
[10321.90s -> 10338.67s]  Oh my goodness, thank God you weren't on that other bench.
[10338.67s -> 10348.82s]  Get Grandma, I'm getting her.
[10348.82s -> 10356.73s]  Distraction.
[10356.73s -> 10357.57s]  Yes, you have.
[10357.57s -> 10365.50s]  I'm safe.
[10365.50s -> 10380.27s]  This is so far away.
[10380.31s -> 10383.34s]  It's a very long drive.
[10383.34s -> 10386.36s]  I think that person's still under my car.
[10386.36s -> 10397.92s]  Are they?
[10397.92s -> 10406.13s]  NA driving in EU.
[10406.13s -> 10419.42s]  Is that gonna explode?
[10419.42s -> 10422.06s]  American streamer, he's on the wrong side of the road.
[10422.06s -> 10429.80s]  American streamer, yeah, that's me.
[10429.80s -> 10432.12s]  All right, it's time to play as old lady
[10432.12s -> 10433.16s]  for the rest of the game
[10433.16s -> 10438.38s]  and I don't even care if it's the worst.
[10440.38s -> 10441.22s]  Awesome.
[10442.66s -> 10447.85s]  Okay, here we go.
[10447.85s -> 10461.26s]  Hey, where are you?
[10461.26s -> 10462.10s]  Talk to Emma.
[10470.42s -> 10479.86s]  Emma, I've returned your car.
[10479.86s -> 10489.15s]  It's just, yes, finally.
[10493.55s -> 10495.55s]  Excellent, didn't they talk like this?
[10495.55s -> 10497.75s]  Aiming often leaves something to be desired
[10497.75s -> 10499.31s]  but the hard drive in that vehicle
[10499.31s -> 10501.79s]  should more than suit your purposes.
[10501.79s -> 10503.35s]  You bet your ass.
[10503.35s -> 10506.27s]  Armed with this, I'll be able to dance circles
[10506.27s -> 10508.15s]  around those Albion thugs
[10508.15s -> 10511.03s]  and shove a boot up their backsides.
[10511.03s -> 10514.43s]  If you need anything at all, I'm at your service.
[10514.43s -> 10515.27s]  Hey, how about now?
[10515.27s -> 10518.11s]  DedSec could always use more people.
[10518.11s -> 10519.23s]  Interested?
[10519.23s -> 10524.09s]  Right, count me in.
[10524.09s -> 10527.45s]  iPad graphics, fucking come on.
[10527.45s -> 10530.15s]  All right, recruit complete. Recruit Emma Tan.
[10531.31s -> 10532.71s]  Here we go. Team.
[10533.70s -> 10534.50s]  There's Emma.
[10534.90s -> 10535.90s]  Swap to Emma.
[10547.10s -> 10548.20s]  Isn't Emma right here?
[10555.24s -> 10556.64s]  Welcome to DedSec, darling.
[10556.94s -> 10558.44s]  We are just thrilled to have you.
[10559.30s -> 10560.00s]  Brilliant.
[10560.20s -> 10562.40s]  I'm not ready to go to pasture yet.
[10562.70s -> 10563.90s]  Let's get to it.
[10564.38s -> 10564.98s]  Yeah.
[10581.62s -> 10583.22s]  How do I, uh, wait, wait, wait.
[10586.40s -> 10587.30s]  The new host.
[10588.84s -> 10590.84s]  She has a wrench. How do I use the wrench?
[10593.70s -> 10594.50s]  It's equipped. Okay.
[10601.65s -> 10602.45s]  New host.
[10603.87s -> 10606.27s]  Holy shit, she's so slow.
[10609.05s -> 10611.15s]  There's no way I'm going to be able to do this.
[10612.86s -> 10613.76s]  Slug.
[10614.26s -> 10615.66s]  And she can steal keys?
[10621.10s -> 10623.90s]  It's all right. All right, let's go. Investigate the AR tech.
[10624.50s -> 10627.70s]  No, let's continue to grow our elderly population.
[10640.38s -> 10640.88s]  Old.
[10645.96s -> 10646.46s]  Old!
[10660.31s -> 10661.11s]  Okay, let's go.
[10665.71s -> 10666.71s]  How do I, okay, recruit.
[10674.80s -> 10676.10s]  What does it, what does it say? What's the bio?
[10677.41s -> 10680.31s]  Uh, doesn't like view, doesn't like me?
[10684.63s -> 10685.33s]  View the bio?
[10685.77s -> 10690.67s]  Has been owed 80 quid by a DedSec member since 2021.
[10691.59s -> 10692.69s]  Doesn't like DedSec.
[10695.02s -> 10696.22s]  Age 55.
[10697.50s -> 10698.30s]  Oh shit.
[10698.80s -> 10699.30s]  Never mind.
[10712.77s -> 10714.17s]  Wait, it said feet?
[10724.42s -> 10725.22s]  Old!
[10725.32s -> 10726.82s]  All right, I'll do a mission with the old lady.
[10727.02s -> 10727.52s]  Let's go.
[10734.08s -> 10735.08s]  The AR tech.
[10736.66s -> 10738.46s]  You are so stupid.
[10739.55s -> 10740.25s]  Oh my God!
[10742.15s -> 10742.55s]  I'm okay.
[10746.75s -> 10747.45s]  Oh, no.
[10747.75s -> 10760.24s]  No, not old.
[10760.34s -> 10764.82s]  Holy shit, this is a million miles away.
[10766.83s -> 10768.43s]  This is so far away. Can I fast travel?
[10772.49s -> 10773.79s]  Fast travel, where's a fast travel?
[10776.03s -> 10776.33s]  Here we go.
[10786.79s -> 10787.89s]  Recruit more old people.
[10787.89s -> 10788.39s]  I'm gonna.
[10801.09s -> 10802.69s]  Don't you think we need new clothes for this person?
[10809.88s -> 10811.08s]  Okay, outerwear.
[10812.97s -> 10814.67s]  Is there like bathrobe or something?
[10819.14s -> 10820.84s]  Oh, this is too, this is too cool.
[10820.84s -> 10821.64s]  This is cool.
[10821.64s -> 10822.44s]  I don't want cool.
[10822.94s -> 10823.74s]  I want casual.
[10830.49s -> 10831.19s]  All right, that's all right.
[10833.90s -> 10834.50s]  Not cool.
[10839.75s -> 10840.25s]  Glasses.
[10840.25s -> 10840.75s]  Yeah, all right.
[10840.75s -> 10841.55s]  We need glasses.
[10846.70s -> 10847.30s]  What about legs?
[10850.02s -> 10851.02s]  Drop legwear.
[10851.32s -> 10853.22s]  No, it's all this, this is dumb.
[10853.22s -> 10853.82s]  I don't want this.
[10860.76s -> 10864.15s]  Uh, we need, we got innerwear.
[10870.13s -> 10871.03s]  Oh, this is stupid.
[10875.98s -> 10876.68s]  What about outerwear?
[10881.64s -> 10882.94s]  Okay, this character sucks.
[10890.88s -> 10891.68s]  What about bag?
[10892.64s -> 10893.54s]  A little backpack?
[10897.79s -> 10898.39s]  All right, that's good.
[10902.02s -> 10903.32s]  Zoomer boomer.
[10906.04s -> 10909.24s]  No, yeah, this isn't every one of those movies where
[10909.44s -> 10910.74s]  the 15 year old
[10910.94s -> 10913.04s]  switches brains with like the 50 year old.
[10915.18s -> 10916.78s]  And then as the
[10917.08s -> 10918.78s]  13 year old 50 year old,
[10918.78s -> 10919.78s]  they dress like this.
[10924.73s -> 10927.23s]  And then they use some crazy teen lingo
[10927.23s -> 10928.23s]  when they're ordering a coffee
[10928.23s -> 10929.33s]  and everybody looks around they're like
[10929.63s -> 10931.13s]  yeah, I'll take a double shot of that
[10931.23s -> 10932.33s]  and it's gonna be lit.
[10933.06s -> 10933.76s]  And everyone around is like
[10933.76s -> 10935.36s]  what the old lady said that?
[10935.56s -> 10936.66s]  That's strange.
[10952.85s -> 10954.89s]  Wait, isn't this the same guy?
[10964.32s -> 10965.92s]  It's the same people from last time.
[10966.02s -> 10966.92s]  Wait, play darts.
[10969.06s -> 10970.06s]  That's not what I wanted to do.
[10971.59s -> 10972.89s]  That's not what I wanted to do.
[10973.09s -> 10982.00s]  Let's play darts.
[10982.30s -> 10983.40s]  Take the mask off.
[10986.77s -> 10988.27s]  I collect, I didn't mean to click.
[10990.76s -> 10991.66s]  Let's play darts.
[10995.56s -> 10996.86s]  I have no idea how to play darts
[10996.86s -> 10998.46s]  and I don't even care to read this.
[11001.75s -> 11002.75s]  I'll just get into the middle.
[11008.90s -> 11009.90s]  Aim, throw.
[11023.14s -> 11023.84s]  Fuck this.
[11038.94s -> 11040.34s]  People are pissing their pants?
[11043.54s -> 11044.64s]  That's a double bull.
[11062.78s -> 11063.48s]  Are they saying that
[11064.08s -> 11065.68s]  I have a gun?
[11105.71s -> 11107.41s]  I just have a gun in my hand.
[11109.32s -> 11117.58s]  I just want to play darts.
[11122.66s -> 11123.26s]  I win.
[11126.17s -> 11126.77s]  Gun.
[11127.31s -> 11128.51s]  Look out, gun.
[11129.46s -> 11130.76s]  She's got a gun.
[11147.41s -> 11148.01s]  What was that?
[11148.01s -> 11149.61s]  Was that Nathan Drake over there?
[11150.31s -> 11151.61s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[11163.18s -> 11164.48s]  This guy keeps pissing his pants.
[11182.91s -> 11184.21s]  Okay, get me the fuck out of here.
[11186.64s -> 11187.64s]  Who's talking shit?
[11205.85s -> 11206.65s]  Hard mode, I win.
[11207.51s -> 11207.91s]  All right.
[11208.11s -> 11210.56s]  So now let's go do this mission.
[11220.64s -> 11221.44s]  Where's the gambling?
[11221.44s -> 11222.64s]  I don't think there's gambling in this game.
[11225.67s -> 11226.67s]  That was pretty sick.
[11232.49s -> 11234.29s]  Realistic old lady driving.
[11235.72s -> 11236.52s]  No, it's not.
[11239.94s -> 11240.54s]  Now it is.
[11255.74s -> 11256.94s]  That's a broken back.
[11257.34s -> 11258.24s]  Holy shit.
[11258.24s -> 11259.14s]  That was horrible.
[11259.83s -> 11260.53s]  She's fine.
[11260.53s -> 11261.23s]  She's all right.
[11262.06s -> 11263.86s]  She's still got a little bit of spunk.
[11271.82s -> 11272.42s]  What are you doing?
[11273.72s -> 11274.72s]  No, what are you doing?
[11275.02s -> 11275.62s]  Get on the bike.
[11277.98s -> 11278.68s]  She's confused.
[11278.78s -> 11286.10s]  Shattered hip.
[11294.62s -> 11295.42s]  My stomach.
[11298.93s -> 11300.43s]  I can't stop thinking about the darts.
[11304.30s -> 11306.60s]  These are GTA 3 tier jokes.
[11307.91s -> 11309.91s]  I mean, is it a joke or am I just...
[11310.41s -> 11311.71s]  Is this game just fucking...
[11317.94s -> 11319.74s]  I was looking at the chat.
[11320.14s -> 11320.64s]  Fuck.
[11324.64s -> 11326.14s]  Red dead all over again.
[11328.73s -> 11329.43s]  What are you doing?
[11336.64s -> 11337.74s]  What the fuck?
[11340.23s -> 11341.03s]  Get off.
[11354.82s -> 11356.32s]  City's fighting back.
[11372.90s -> 11373.30s]  Wait.
[11373.30s -> 11375.00s]  Oh, I'm getting super deja vu.
[11375.00s -> 11375.40s]  This is...
[11376.50s -> 11378.10s]  I was here already with a different person.
[11387.97s -> 11389.07s]  Okay, let's go in here.
[11390.87s -> 11391.17s]  All right.
[11391.17s -> 11392.07s]  Rainy's ready to go.
[11398.82s -> 11400.72s]  Investigate the AR tech.
[11411.06s -> 11412.56s]  Security lasers will alert guards.
[11412.56s -> 11413.76s]  Disable them by hacking them.
[11421.91s -> 11422.11s]  All right.
[11422.11s -> 11422.41s]  What about...
[11422.41s -> 11422.71s]  How do I...
[11422.71s -> 11423.51s]  I need to hack them.
[11424.88s -> 11425.48s]  Is there a camera?
[11433.13s -> 11433.43s]  All right.
[11433.63s -> 11434.23s]  Mask on.
[11440.50s -> 11441.20s]  Power this shit up.
[11447.28s -> 11447.58s]  Now what?
[11448.79s -> 11451.49s]  Launch AR reconstruction test.
[11453.79s -> 11454.99s]  How the fuck do I do that?
[11459.82s -> 11460.72s]  Wait, is this a trap door?
[11460.72s -> 11462.02s]  Can I like trap somebody in there?

[11497.86s -> 11498.26s]  Cool.
[11502.56s -> 11503.46s]  Ethereal.
[11503.86s -> 11505.06s]  And strange.
[11505.56s -> 11506.96s]  Nobody suspects the old lady.
[11514.96s -> 11515.96s]  Old diaper.

[11535.20s -> 11537.00s]  Today we're playing a game that I...
[11537.30s -> 11539.20s]  I'm so glad you raided now
[11539.20s -> 11540.50s]  and not like three hours ago

[11545.00s -> 11545.30s]  I...
[11545.40s -> 11545.80s]  By the way,
[11545.80s -> 11547.30s]  I might have made this really clear to everybody.
[11548.20s -> 11548.60s]  My game...
[11548.60s -> 11549.40s]  My computer sucks
[11549.40s -> 11551.10s]  and I can't run this fucking shitty game.
[11551.20s -> 11551.50s]  Why?
[11551.50s -> 11552.40s]  The game's not shitty.
[11552.40s -> 11552.90s]  Maybe it is.
[11556.82s -> 11559.02s]  This is a fucking huge raid by the way.

[11573.58s -> 11574.38s]  He's got it going on.
[11574.38s -> 11574.88s]  Trust me.
[11582.14s -> 11583.04s]  Freudian slip.
[11583.04s -> 11583.34s]  All right.
[11583.34s -> 11585.24s]  Let me get back to what I was doing.
[11586.14s -> 11586.84s]  Oh, by the way,
[11586.84s -> 11588.84s]  I know that Ludwig says he could beat me in a fight.
[11591.14s -> 11591.54s]  It depends.

[11677.86s -> 11678.66s]  Can I pick up that shotgun?
[11682.65s -> 11683.15s]  Give me the shotgun.
[11686.64s -> 11687.34s]  I just have to leave.
[11693.92s -> 11695.32s]  Minus 10k, Andy.
[11696.84s -> 11697.84s]  That's what happens on...
[11697.84s -> 11698.74s]  Hey, it's all right.
[11700.44s -> 11701.04s]  No, seriously.
[11701.04s -> 11701.94s]  Thanks to the raid though, Ludwig.
[11705.28s -> 11706.18s]  What do I have to do?
[11708.38s -> 11710.08s]  You didn't sing the raid song.
[11710.08s -> 11710.58s]  Fuck.
[11716.78s -> 11718.98s]  Wait, am I getting locked out of what I want to do?

[13162.16s -> 13176.58s]  It's just been paint. I paint my clothes on
[13177.10s -> 13183.24s]  It was an old SNL skit from
[13183.80s -> 13186.70s]  25 years ago about shirt in a can
[13187.32s -> 13188.76s]  It's pretty funny
[13188.76s -> 13194.01s]  They have somebody sprays it on him
[13194.01s -> 13198.31s]  It's like a shirt in a can and they spray it all over the body and the guy starts going it's burning my skin
[13198.83s -> 13201.71s]  And I thought it was really funny

[13254.71s -> 13276.82s]  I know whatever NA aim NA 25 FPS aim. I'm losing DPI on every move
[13297.24s -> 13301.08s]  This was better when it didn't work and when you were having trouble

[13481.88s -> 13484.40s]  Did we get a random person because I didn't recruit enough people
[13488.36s -> 13491.60s]  They took out dead sex once and it's a good bet. They'll try again
[13491.60s -> 13495.40s]  I believe they were responsible for the bombings and the construction worker. Okay

[14057.01s -> 14073.65s]  That's not how it works. Doesn't it read the lines on the road with like I'm near me like a scanner

[14296.94s -> 14310.58s]  Why did I have to pick her up and I just go in here on the source. Okay, I found it
[14310.98s -> 14326.00s]  Source of the power. This is a damaged spider-bot leg. What the fuck? Are you serious guys?
[14329.26s -> 14334.60s]  No indication yet who belongs to good god, it's been torn asunder
[14335.32s -> 14337.49s]  What is it doing here?
[14337.65s -> 14343.25s]  Difficult to say but with an AR reconstruction, we may be able to see what happened to it and if it relates to the attack
[14343.73s -> 14345.73s]  70% of people want to see you play a different game
[14346.49s -> 14350.49s]  I'll make sure you show up to the screen tomorrow. We're playing the little hope me and it's Alex

[14740.43s -> 14761.31s]  Let's do a tier list. All right, we'll do one tier list. What do you got?
[14761.43s -> 14784.24s]  Maybe maybe more than one German meltdown stream tier list. Wait. All right, I'll do this one. Hold on. What else we got
