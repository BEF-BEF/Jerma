[0.31s -> 15.27s]  Hello there ladies and gentlemen, it's Grandpa here. I took over the Minecraft series for
[15.27s -> 23.35s]  Jerma. So let's, um, I've never played this game before. I have no idea what I'm doing
[23.35s -> 27.29s]  so like you're gonna have to give me like a couple seconds to figure out what the fuck
[27.29s -> 35.30s]  is going on here. Okay, I got some slime balls, got some rotten fleshy to play with. So what
[35.30s -> 43.94s]  are you doing this game? What do I have to do here? So I have decided I'm going to build a farm.
[44.58s -> 57.34s]  So let's corral these fucking cows. Come here cows. Okay. That's not how you sing that song.
[57.34s -> 64.90s]  Okay, so you stay here. Get the fuck, get over there. I need to make a place where these cows
[65.83s -> 80.94s]  hold on a second. Do I have anything? Yes, I do. Okay, so let's make a farm. I'm gonna corral these
[80.94s -> 91.27s]  cattle and make them do my bidding. Okay, come on. We know you want to see the outside world,
[91.27s -> 97.61s]  but that's just not gonna happen. Get the fuck over here. Get over there. Get over here. Come
[97.61s -> 106.09s]  here. You're in big trouble. Your name is Bessie, by the way. You know what? Um, I'm just gonna
[106.09s -> 111.88s]  fucking kill you. Oh, hey, boys. How you doing? Nothing just happened over there. Just me and
[111.88s -> 119.56s]  Bessie. We're having a talk about her recent school studies. And okay, so get in the get in
[119.56s -> 127.11s]  the tank over here, George. That's your name. Your name is George. George, get in the tank.
[129.58s -> 136.04s]  Hey, Mortimer. Mortimer, look over there for a second. Fucking stupid cow. Okay, looks like,
[136.04s -> 141.72s]  hey, Mortimer. You okay? We're good here. I got you all set up. I got, uh, uh, George just had to
[141.72s -> 147.05s]  go to the bathroom, so that's why he left. You know what, Steve? You can have your own little
[147.05s -> 156.74s]  pen over here because you're like a, you're a nice cow. Shit. Sand. Okay, Steve, this is your little
[156.74s -> 166.10s]  pen here. Got nothing to worry about. Okay, so that's your pen, Steve. What the fuck? This
[166.10s -> 174.31s]  game looks like it's made out of Legos. What the hell is this? Like, look at this. This is beautiful.
[175.11s -> 185.21s]  This is a beautiful game. Why didn't I play this before? Look at how magical this is. Everything is
[185.21s -> 193.94s]  so vast and amazing. I want to go look at that over there. Hold on. Wait, I, I didn't know you
[193.94s -> 205.03s]  can fucking die in this game. You can die. I didn't, oh, I, hold on. So where's, where's all my stuff?
[206.97s -> 215.67s]  Oh, you piece of shit. Um, so what do you guys want to do? No, I don't, I don't want to go to the
[215.67s -> 224.73s]  playground. I want to go to see the new mountaintop. What do you want? No, no, I don't care about your
[224.73s -> 234.79s]  stupid door to door salesman thing. Get out of here. What are you looking at? So somebody told me
[235.43s -> 241.18s]  that Jeremy usually sings a song when he plays this game. So I'm going to try my hand at that.
[241.18s -> 246.81s]  Let's see if I'm a good singer like he is. I guess I could, I could talk about the bugs that
[246.81s -> 250.89s]  are in the water right now. There's a ton of bugs in here. Okay, so let's get a beat going.
[252.86s -> 269.70s]  The bugs look so stupid and they stink.
[272.26s -> 279.46s]  And then we go to the bug water fountain and I drink and then I fucking puke because bug water
[280.42s -> 290.55s]  tastes not very good. Oh, look at this. It's an underwater cave. This is beautiful. I wonder
[290.55s -> 296.86s]  if I could make it. What was that? What the hell was that? Oh my God, it's a spider. I fucking hate
[296.86s -> 311.18s]  spiders. Get the fuck away from me. I hate spiders. Oh, oh, that was intense. So see you later,
[311.18s -> 319.66s]  everybody. I literally have to go to the doctor so I can't stick around anymore.
[319.66s -> 323.58s]  This game's kind of fun though. I would like to play this maybe never again because I'm not that
[323.58s -> 330.84s]  good at it. I'm terrible, but I have to go to the doctor so you look at my colon. So see you later,
[330.84s -> 334.36s]  everybody. Have a wonderful day. Bye.
