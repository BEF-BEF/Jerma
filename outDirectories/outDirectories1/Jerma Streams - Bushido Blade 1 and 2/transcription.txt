[1.08s -> 13.45s]  So I wasn't going to start streaming for like another couple minutes, but I just, my brain went into autopilot and I tweeted that the stream was live and then I went, oh fuck, oh, oh, oh, and I just pressed live.
[13.45s -> 18.65s]  I wasn't planning on it. I just did it early. I did the tweet first.
[18.65s -> 30.23s]  And look, I know, I know, but just link your Twitter to Twitch and it'll just do a tweet. I don't want the robots taking over my accounts. Sorry.
[30.23s -> 47.11s]  I don't want any, I don't want any, then it like goes into your Twitter and it like reads your tweets and sends them to Bezos. Where do you think they go?
[47.11s -> 68.95s]  What do you think his toilet reading material is? Anyways, the app is not letting me see the screen. My tweets. Yeah, just mine.
[68.95s -> 79.40s]  Anyways, we're going to play. Hey, first of all, hi, welcome. We're going to play Bushido Blade. I think I'm saying that right.
[79.40s -> 86.83s]  Bushido Blade and maybe Bushido Blade 2. It depends on if I can even get past the second enemy in this game.
[86.83s -> 97.87s]  This is a classic. This is an old favorite of a lot of people. This game is different from some of the other games you may have played.
[97.87s -> 105.30s]  At least it's kind of a fighting game, but it's different because if you get hit once, you die.
[105.30s -> 111.99s]  And if you hit somebody else, they die in one hit, typically.
[111.99s -> 124.17s]  So that with that in mind, is this the first or second one is the first one, but I also have the second one right next to me.
[124.17s -> 131.98s]  And I know I've been told because I played this game when I was 12 or something of 13.
[131.98s -> 138.61s]  And I just didn't get it. And I hated it. I think I've rented it. And I was like, this game sucks. This is stupid.
[138.61s -> 142.85s]  I don't like this because you just die in one hit and I had no idea what was going on.
[142.85s -> 153.06s]  But now as an adult, I understand that what's going on. So I'll be ready.
[153.06s -> 163.43s]  But to jump on the thing I was just saying, this game, the second one is apparently just a better version of the first game, but I got them both.
[163.43s -> 171.11s]  That's what I've been told. Anyways, welcome. Hope everyone's having a good day.
[171.11s -> 182.03s]  I'm still trying to figure out. So as of tomorrow, I'm probably going to do. I don't know. I have to get ready to leave.
[182.03s -> 187.40s]  I have to leave. If you weren't here last night, the Halloween stream is not happening in Vegas.
[187.40s -> 193.97s]  I'm going on location for that special stream. Should be a lot of fun.
[193.97s -> 200.27s]  So if there is a stream tomorrow, it's going to be short, like probably less than a few hours.
[200.27s -> 207.10s]  Oh, you just nailed it right there. That one one guy. Jackbox done.
[207.10s -> 212.53s]  Jackbox tomorrow for like two, three hours, four hours. Done. Easy. Perfect.
[212.53s -> 219.38s]  And that just shit just came out. Yeah. Yes, I did it.
[219.38s -> 233.35s]  Anyways, here we go. Classic video games. Just shoot a blade. I'm ready to attempt. Here we go.
[233.35s -> 239.42s]  There are other modes in this game, but I don't. I mean, I'm just saying just baptism by fire.
[239.42s -> 245.90s]  What do you think? I'm just going to go POV mode.
[245.90s -> 249.90s]  Well, we could. We have to do the POV mode after I figure out what the hell I'm doing.
[249.90s -> 268.70s]  OK, so. All right, I'm going to do this. I think I'm going to be this guy.
[268.70s -> 278.66s]  What weapon do I want to use? Tana. I don't even know what any of these are.
[278.66s -> 282.09s]  Is it? OK, wait, broadsword. That sounds pretty good.
[282.09s -> 288.22s]  Broad sword. Minecraft sword. Yeah. Hammer.
[288.22s -> 295.78s]  OK, I'll do the hammer. Is this the fucking hardest thing to use?
[295.78s -> 298.78s]  That's not even. What is this thing? It's a sword. I'm holding it by the blade.
[298.78s -> 307.52s]  There's no subtitles. Pay attention.
[307.52s -> 312.82s]  This is really a secret society of assassins called Kagei.
[312.82s -> 320.12s]  Everyone who knew was sworn to secrecy.
[320.12s -> 328.12s]  One person broke the code of silence and escaped into the ruins of a deserted castle
[328.12s -> 334.58s]  in search of the only way out through the castle tower.
[334.58s -> 341.49s]  I should have picked the broadsword.
[342.49s -> 345.49s]  We actually do get subtitles.
[354.66s -> 365.22s]  OK, it's time for me. It's kind of like a fighting game, but it's not really a fighting game, but it is.
[365.22s -> 369.22s]  It just is. All right, here we go. How do you play?
[370.22s -> 375.46s]  Wait, he got hit. You mirror hammer. I didn't hit him?
[380.46s -> 384.46s]  Dude, the hammer sucks. All right, hit him in the head.
[386.46s -> 387.46s]  Got him.
[391.14s -> 394.14s]  All right, I did it. I got him in the head like three times.
[394.14s -> 397.96s]  This is supposed to be one hit kill. What am I doing?
[405.46s -> 408.66s]  You crushed his face in.
[411.10s -> 413.10s]  Oh, shit. OK, round two.
[414.10s -> 415.10s]  Fight.
[415.10s -> 419.10s]  OK, so Serpa looks like a... You have a blade.
[419.10s -> 424.10s]  This is not even a sledgehammer. This is a stick with two bells on it.
[426.34s -> 428.34s]  She hit me with the flat end.
[428.34s -> 432.34s]  Oh, she hit me with the flat end. I'm fine. Oh, shit.
[437.97s -> 440.97s]  Oh, my God. That's pretty brutal, actually.
[440.97s -> 443.85s]  Sledgehammer is actually pretty good.
[446.85s -> 456.64s]  So is this still level one? It's a war hammer. Aren't war hammers shorter?
[456.64s -> 458.64s]  All right, no message.
[462.80s -> 465.80s]  No, no, don't do it. I'm bleeding out of the leg.
[469.17s -> 473.17s]  Oh, God. Oh, God, please. Don't do it.
[473.17s -> 477.01s]  Head. Hit in the head.
[480.38s -> 484.38s]  Come on, I'm just going to crush head.
[485.82s -> 487.82s]  OK, L1 is one.
[487.82s -> 494.30s]  All right, I'm going to do a running circle.
[494.30s -> 496.30s]  Oh, I would have had it.
[498.30s -> 499.92s]  No!
[502.80s -> 507.90s]  A lot of coward. I'm just being tactical.
[507.90s -> 510.90s]  Oh, damn it. Why am I not dying?
[510.90s -> 513.90s]  What? Are they using practice swords?
[518.39s -> 519.39s]  I'm dead.
[529.10s -> 530.10s]  Continue.
[532.30s -> 534.30s]  Easy mode. No, this is on hard.
[534.30s -> 538.54s]  OK, is there a block? Triangle is like a quick one.
[540.17s -> 542.17s]  OK, square is a little parry.
[545.35s -> 548.04s]  All right, I get it.
[552.37s -> 555.25s]  Yeah, square is like a...
[556.25s -> 558.62s]  Yeah, I got you.
[562.95s -> 569.61s]  I could both find legs.
[572.78s -> 575.78s]  I got really banged up legs.
[575.78s -> 583.18s]  Yeah, one hit weapon master. All right, here we go.
[586.00s -> 588.00s]  I got to get a good parry.
[594.04s -> 596.04s]  You can hit stuff.
[597.04s -> 599.98s]  I tried to run.
[600.98s -> 607.42s]  If you did that in a real fight, that would be really embarrassing.
[607.42s -> 609.42s]  Do I just keep all my scars?
[610.42s -> 614.42s]  Yeah, I'm like, oh, I don't think I can use my left arm.
[628.71s -> 631.71s]  What? He killed me. Yeah, he did.
[637.75s -> 641.76s]  Damn it. How many continues do I get?
[641.76s -> 643.76s]  OK, this is the hard boss.
[643.76s -> 647.22s]  Trying to give him a chance.
[654.46s -> 656.46s]  Get out of here. Got him.
[661.34s -> 666.34s]  No honor. Yeah, I know. That's the equivalent of punching the guy before the bell, but whatever.
[673.87s -> 676.94s]  Now what?
[676.94s -> 678.94s]  Where am I going?
[683.66s -> 686.74s]  I'm not controlling this.
[686.74s -> 690.17s]  What? All right, we're going down to the sewer.
[696.18s -> 698.18s]  Let's have a clean fight. Sure.
[704.75s -> 709.85s]  Got him. Double tap him. Get out of my way.
[709.85s -> 713.34s]  By the way, you might not be noticing the nuance there.
[713.34s -> 717.29s]  That was a parry block into a double tap.
[721.29s -> 723.29s]  Like I said, this weapon sucks.
[730.72s -> 744.66s]  Did I win? I win.
[752.55s -> 759.54s]  I remember this game. Why was this game so hard when I was younger?
[759.54s -> 762.54s]  I don't think I beat the first person.
[762.54s -> 772.59s]  All right, new character. POV mode.
[772.59s -> 779.31s]  I have to play honorably. OK, fine.
[779.31s -> 781.31s]  I do want to use... I want to use...
[781.31s -> 784.31s]  I'm going to use a small thing like this thing.
[784.31s -> 786.31s]  Actually, this is going to be hard.
[786.31s -> 790.31s]  All right, you can use the long sword. That's fine.
[790.31s -> 793.31s]  How much did I pay for this?
[793.31s -> 795.31s]  I don't think it was very much.
[795.31s -> 797.31s]  What's an arena?
[800.58s -> 802.58s]  Be honorable. Stop killing.
[802.58s -> 804.58s]  You have to kill...
[804.58s -> 814.48s]  Are you kidding me? This is actually pretty cool.
[814.48s -> 822.61s]  I can't even... Oh, I have to block. Get up!
[822.61s -> 824.61s]  Did I lose? I'm dead.
[829.64s -> 833.78s]  It's different in VR. It's harder in VR.
[833.78s -> 841.20s]  All right, I'll get him here.
[841.20s -> 850.12s]  No, wait. It's a short sword, right?
[850.12s -> 852.12s]  What?
[852.12s -> 861.40s]  He fell down.
[861.40s -> 864.79s]  I was trying to hold for his head.
[865.79s -> 868.67s]  It looks like a Roblox game.
[868.67s -> 872.94s]  Continue? Why am I continuing for you?
[872.94s -> 874.94s]  What?
[882.37s -> 884.86s]  Got him instantly.
[884.86s -> 886.86s]  Wait, he's...
[886.86s -> 888.86s]  I got to see that in slow motion.
[888.86s -> 891.62s]  Watch this. Bang.
[891.62s -> 894.50s]  Nice try.
[894.50s -> 899.08s]  Go back to story mode and play honorably.
[899.08s -> 903.08s]  Well, I need to not continue for the computer.
[903.08s -> 905.38s]  All right, fine. I'm going to do...
[905.38s -> 907.38s]  Maybe the sled chamber was easy mode.
[907.38s -> 917.03s]  What's the hard weapon?
[918.66s -> 924.93s]  Fists.
[924.93s -> 926.93s]  You can't use fists.
[926.93s -> 931.98s]  No weapon.
[931.98s -> 933.98s]  Fist. I can't select zero weapon.
[933.98s -> 935.98s]  How about just...
[935.98s -> 942.00s]  How about just long sword?
[942.00s -> 948.45s]  Or katana.
[948.45s -> 951.45s]  None means I eject a disc from the tray.
[951.45s -> 954.90s]  Google how to be honorable.
[954.90s -> 956.90s]  What?
[956.90s -> 962.22s]  Are you guys making this up?
[962.22s -> 972.90s]  Hold on a minute. This is real?
[972.90s -> 974.90s]  Hold on. Did I just go through and just kill everybody?
[974.90s -> 982.65s]  And I wasn't supposed to do that.
[982.65s -> 985.46s]  Oh. I just...
[985.46s -> 988.54s]  I don't know. It is real.
[988.54s -> 990.54s]  Okay, hold on.
[990.54s -> 992.54s]  Fight with honor.
[1008.78s -> 1010.78s]  Don't be careless.
[1010.78s -> 1012.78s]  How do I fight honorably? Honor the code.
[1019.78s -> 1021.78s]  Don't strike opponents in the back.
[1021.78s -> 1023.78s]  Don't throw dust at people.
[1023.78s -> 1025.78s]  Don't strike opponents while they're lying down
[1025.78s -> 1028.78s]  or attack opponents before the start of the fight.
[1028.78s -> 1030.78s]  Which I did every time.
[1030.78s -> 1033.95s]  If any of these dishonorable acts take place,
[1033.95s -> 1036.95s]  the story will end in the middle of the playthrough.
[1036.95s -> 1038.95s]  The screen will display a message
[1038.95s -> 1040.95s]  and berate the player for his cowardly act.
[1040.95s -> 1043.58s]  What?
[1043.58s -> 1050.17s]  So what can I not do?
[1050.17s -> 1052.17s]  No stabbing in the back.
[1052.17s -> 1054.41s]  Don't throw dust and don't...
[1054.41s -> 1056.41s]  I don't attack while they're lying...
[1056.41s -> 1058.41s]  Alright. I got it.
[1058.41s -> 1063.53s]  Don't hit them while they're down.
[1063.53s -> 1065.53s]  Am I trying to win?
[1065.53s -> 1071.80s]  What am I trying to do here?
[1076.17s -> 1078.47s]  Fight with honor.
[1081.29s -> 1085.75s]  Be honorable.
[1087.75s -> 1089.75s]  Is stabbing in the back a win?
[1089.75s -> 1092.18s]  In terms of a deserted castle,
[1092.18s -> 1094.18s]  in search of the only way out...
[1094.18s -> 1096.18s]  I'll do it.
[1096.18s -> 1098.18s]  ...to the castle tower.
[1098.18s -> 1100.18s]  One hit is actually dishonorable.
[1100.18s -> 1102.18s]  Maybe this is why I didn't understand it.
[1102.18s -> 1104.18s]  I still don't understand it as an adult.
[1104.18s -> 1106.18s]  I returned this game to Blockbuster.
[1112.18s -> 1114.18s]  Okay. So I'm just going to stand
[1114.18s -> 1116.18s]  if somebody falls down.
[1116.18s -> 1118.18s]  But what if they trip?
[1118.18s -> 1121.00s]  I didn't know there was a dust throw button in the game.
[1121.00s -> 1123.00s]  I'm probably going to accidentally do it
[1123.00s -> 1125.00s]  and ruin the playthrough.
[1125.00s -> 1129.22s]  I don't even know the move set for this thing.
[1129.22s -> 1131.22s]  I should have done hammer.
[1131.22s -> 1133.22s]  Alright. Here we go.
[1133.22s -> 1135.22s]  Don't attack.
[1135.22s -> 1137.22s]  We're ready.
[1157.88s -> 1159.88s]  Come on.
[1159.88s -> 1161.88s]  I can't just run in there and stab.
[1161.88s -> 1163.88s]  It's not so easy now, is it?
[1163.88s -> 1165.88s]  Oh. Come on.
[1165.88s -> 1167.88s]  I like it.
[1173.11s -> 1175.11s]  Was that dishonorable?
[1175.11s -> 1177.11s]  You're doing a backflip? That's showing off.
[1181.50s -> 1188.39s]  The block.
[1188.39s -> 1196.58s]  What? You did a backflip and I did a backflip
[1196.58s -> 1198.58s]  and then you slit my throat.
[1198.58s -> 1200.58s]  Can't win with honor.
[1200.58s -> 1202.58s]  Yes, I can.
[1202.58s -> 1204.58s]  Shit. Kill me. Kill me. I didn't mean to do that.
[1204.58s -> 1207.66s]  Kill me.
[1207.66s -> 1217.96s]  You need to kill everyone without dying.
[1217.96s -> 1219.96s]  That's not going to happen.
[1222.39s -> 1224.39s]  Okay. Here we go.
[1224.39s -> 1226.39s]  I don't like this weapon.
[1228.39s -> 1230.39s]  Give me a fucking break.
[1230.39s -> 1232.39s]  This weapon sucks.
[1232.39s -> 1234.39s]  I need my hammer back.
[1237.78s -> 1239.78s]  This is probably the weapon I picked when I was 12.
[1239.78s -> 1241.78s]  And I was like, this is stupid.
[1244.60s -> 1252.01s]  Can't play without the...
[1252.01s -> 1254.01s]  My inputs didn't...
[1254.01s -> 1256.01s]  I'm not going to make a complaint about inputs.
[1256.01s -> 1258.01s]  Nope. That's an automatic
[1258.01s -> 1260.01s]  you suck moment.
[1260.01s -> 1262.01s]  My inputs weren't even... Oh, you said the word
[1262.01s -> 1264.01s]  inputs. Automatic.
[1264.01s -> 1266.01s]  I don't listen to the next three words.
[1272.09s -> 1274.65s]  That wasn't an instant kill, but yours is.
[1276.89s -> 1280.54s]  Input equals dishonorable.
[1282.54s -> 1284.54s]  I don't like this move set either.
[1284.54s -> 1286.54s]  Somehow I died.
[1286.54s -> 1288.54s]  Somehow I think I killed myself with the sword.
[1288.54s -> 1290.97s]  How?
[1290.97s -> 1292.97s]  What?
[1292.97s -> 1295.14s]  The fuck? I can't do it.
[1295.14s -> 1297.14s]  Honorable. No, I can't do it.
[1297.14s -> 1299.14s]  No, I can't do it with this weapon. This weapon sucks.
[1301.14s -> 1303.14s]  That's not going to kill?
[1303.14s -> 1306.98s]  Easy. Is running dishonorable?
[1306.98s -> 1316.78s]  I didn't run technically.
[1316.78s -> 1321.00s]  How would... I stabbed you in the fucking face.
[1323.00s -> 1325.00s]  Okay.
[1325.00s -> 1327.56s]  Don't stab me in the face.
[1327.56s -> 1334.02s]  Don't stab me in the back.
[1334.02s -> 1338.89s]  Dishonorable.
[1338.89s -> 1340.89s]  That wasn't the back. Okay, I hit you three times.
[1345.05s -> 1348.25s]  That wasn't the back.
[1348.25s -> 1350.25s]  I hit her three times with the same sword
[1350.25s -> 1352.25s]  that she's using, and I died with
[1352.25s -> 1354.74s]  one hit.
[1354.74s -> 1356.74s]  What kind of bullshit, dishonorable
[1356.74s -> 1358.74s]  bullshit is that?
[1361.05s -> 1363.86s]  Get out of here.
[1363.86s -> 1365.86s]  What'd I do?
[1365.86s -> 1368.23s]  That wasn't dishonorable, right?
[1368.23s -> 1372.46s]  Just use a different weapon.
[1372.46s -> 1374.46s]  Yeah, but I've already beat the first boss.
[1384.17s -> 1386.17s]  A skilled opponent can insta-kill
[1386.17s -> 1388.17s]  without... Did you pay attention?
[1388.17s -> 1390.17s]  The title of my stream is
[1390.17s -> 1392.17s]  you can one-hit in this game.
[1392.17s -> 1396.01s]  What?
[1399.19s -> 1404.30s]  I tried to do the backflip.
[1406.30s -> 1409.24s]  No, it's not hammer time. Actually, I want to do the training.
[1409.24s -> 1411.24s]  Hold on.
[1414.12s -> 1417.32s]  Okay, R1 is a different stance.
[1419.32s -> 1421.69s]  I actually like this stance.
[1423.86s -> 1426.87s]  Nice block.
[1426.87s -> 1432.44s]  Got it.
[1434.81s -> 1436.81s]  I got right into the intestines.
[1436.81s -> 1441.29s]  That dishonorable stance.
[1447.75s -> 1455.11s]  There's no such thing. I like that stance.
[1457.80s -> 1459.98s]  Okay, here we go.
[1459.98s -> 1461.98s]  You're not going to get anywhere just by
[1461.98s -> 1463.98s]  the ball spinning.
[1466.34s -> 1469.74s]  Got a little stab there.
[1469.74s -> 1476.26s]  Bang.
[1476.26s -> 1479.59s]  I didn't even...
[1479.59s -> 1482.73s]  I didn't need to try. That was really easy.
[1490.10s -> 1492.10s]  I don't... Five of shit.
[1492.10s -> 1494.10s]  Don't... Is he going to make that... You going to make that thing now?
[1500.10s -> 1502.73s]  Okay.
[1502.73s -> 1505.29s]  Change stance.
[1505.29s -> 1507.46s]  Good block.
[1509.46s -> 1511.46s]  What happens now?
[1514.02s -> 1519.66s]  Is it like a race?
[1519.66s -> 1521.66s]  Who hit the ground first? Oh, come on.
[1526.76s -> 1528.76s]  No, kill me. I didn't even swing.
[1530.76s -> 1532.76s]  You're hitting me when I'm on the ground.
[1532.76s -> 1534.76s]  Holy shit.
[1534.76s -> 1536.76s]  That was really
[1536.76s -> 1538.76s]  dishonorable.
[1538.76s -> 1540.76s]  Oh my god.
[1540.76s -> 1542.76s]  That's like
[1542.76s -> 1544.76s]  dialed to 11.
[1544.76s -> 1548.60s]  I thought you said not to hit
[1548.60s -> 1550.60s]  people on the ground. What do you mean you can do that?
[1550.60s -> 1552.78s]  No, you can't.
[1557.58s -> 1559.58s]  Oh, shit.
[1559.58s -> 1561.58s]  What came out of me?
[1566.50s -> 1569.00s]  How did I drop? Did I drop like
[1569.00s -> 1571.88s]  loot?
[1573.88s -> 1581.50s]  Okay.
[1581.50s -> 1584.12s]  I've been honorable so far.
[1584.12s -> 1586.94s]  We're going to jump down in the
[1586.94s -> 1588.94s]  sewer.
[1588.94s -> 1591.88s]  Take me the long way. I'm going to just jump in.
[1591.88s -> 1598.86s]  This is the sewer of honor.
[1600.86s -> 1603.22s]  Okay.
[1605.22s -> 1607.22s]  Oh, shit. Let me get out.
[1607.22s -> 1609.22s]  Aw, where's the honor?
[1609.22s -> 1611.22s]  My legs are broken.
[1611.22s -> 1613.22s]  Is this honorable?
[1620.23s -> 1625.03s]  Step on his fingers.
[1625.03s -> 1627.03s]  Shit.
[1632.98s -> 1635.35s]  Get up.
[1635.35s -> 1637.35s]  Oh, dishonorable.
[1637.35s -> 1639.35s]  You punk.
[1639.35s -> 1641.35s]  No, get away from me.
[1641.35s -> 1645.56s]  No, let me get up.
[1645.56s -> 1649.02s]  There's no honor in what you're doing.
[1653.62s -> 1660.22s]  Get away.
[1660.22s -> 1662.22s]  Get away from me.
[1662.22s -> 1668.47s]  Get away.
[1668.47s -> 1670.47s]  This is not even...
[1676.68s -> 1678.68s]  I'm just
[1678.68s -> 1680.68s]  sick of my shit at that point.
[1680.68s -> 1682.68s]  I think I did some dishonorable things.
[1684.68s -> 1686.68s]  Prepare.
[1686.68s -> 1688.68s]  I'm prepared.
[1688.68s -> 1690.68s]  Let's end this.
[1690.68s -> 1692.68s]  He's wearing body armor.
[1694.68s -> 1696.68s]  How much health do you...
[1696.68s -> 1698.68s]  What the fuck?
[1698.68s -> 1700.68s]  Should I not have done that if you stabbed
[1700.68s -> 1702.68s]  when they're dead?
[1704.68s -> 1709.10s]  Is that all right?
[1709.10s -> 1711.10s]  Is that okay?
[1718.55s -> 1720.55s]  I really hope that's not
[1720.55s -> 1727.72s]  a problem.
[1729.72s -> 1731.72s]  This looks like a gun.
[1731.72s -> 1733.72s]  Wait.
[1733.72s -> 1735.72s]  A gun?
[1735.72s -> 1737.72s]  Why do you have a gun?
[1739.72s -> 1745.99s]  Play honorably.
[1745.99s -> 1747.99s]  Shoot gun at somebody.
[1747.99s -> 1750.36s]  Are you kidding me?
[1752.36s -> 1754.36s]  Can I block it like a Jedi?
[1754.36s -> 1756.36s]  What?
[1774.01s -> 1776.01s]  God damn it.
[1783.51s -> 1785.51s]  Is this God?
[1785.51s -> 1787.51s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[1792.20s -> 1794.20s]  I can't block the bullets.
[1794.20s -> 1796.20s]  Is it dishonorable?
[1796.20s -> 1798.20s]  I can't attack before he gets his text out.
[1798.20s -> 1800.20s]  I can't attack before he gets his text out
[1800.20s -> 1802.20s]  and I can't move.
[1806.20s -> 1808.20s]  Prepare.
[1808.20s -> 1811.91s]  Prepare.
[1811.91s -> 1816.50s]  Prepare.
[1821.45s -> 1823.45s]  Take it easy.
[1823.45s -> 1825.45s]  Don't die.
[1825.45s -> 1828.26s]  Don't die.
[1828.26s -> 1830.26s]  Take it easy.
[1830.26s -> 1832.26s]  Don't die.
[1832.26s -> 1834.26s]  Don't die.
[1834.26s -> 1839.46s]  I just, I know I've listened to somebody in the chat, but I'm running at the guy with the gun.
[1845.46s -> 1846.02s]  See you later.
[1851.90s -> 1855.78s]  Okay, does the next person have an assault rifle or something?
[1869.70s -> 1872.55s]  He fight a tank. Now that would be funny.
[1874.55s -> 1888.17s]  Easy. He's got a, he has the Darth Maul thing. I don't know what they're called. Yes, I know. It's a called actually something, but it's not as known by Darth Maul.
[1904.44s -> 1906.36s]  It's too long. It's too long.
[1911.02s -> 1914.62s]  Get over here. Oh no, don't, don't hit him.
[1924.47s -> 1926.47s]  That's how you, I don't know. That's how you did that.
[1938.89s -> 1941.69s]  The back, not the back. Walk this. God damn it.
[1945.94s -> 1952.66s]  That's not a bad idea.
[1962.57s -> 1964.89s]  He got a little coffee. I might be his downfall.
[1969.05s -> 1980.57s]  Who's after this guy?
[1982.87s -> 1984.87s]  All right, I'll get it now. Here we go.
[1989.56s -> 1991.56s]  Block him.
[1998.22s -> 2002.25s]  Come on, I'm in that combo.
[2002.25s -> 2006.92s]  Whoa, what was, damn it.
[2006.92s -> 2012.87s]  Side step the lance. I was trying for it right there.
[2021.00s -> 2026.38s]  Now that I,
[2033.34s -> 2036.86s]  Jesus God.
[2036.86s -> 2040.86s]  All right, now that I've had some time to see different weapons and action,
[2040.86s -> 2042.86s]  and this is, this is an accurate accurate,
[2043.66s -> 2048.86s]  um, the, the lance is, that's the best weapon that's ever been invented in hand-to-hand combat.
[2048.86s -> 2050.86s]  You can just stand like 10 feet away.
[2050.86s -> 2052.86s]  It's not great, isn't it?
[2052.86s -> 2055.42s]  Isn't it like the best weapon ever?
[2059.64s -> 2061.64s]  Got it.
[2061.64s -> 2063.64s]  He's not, I thought he wasn't dead.
[2065.64s -> 2067.64s]  He was doing what I was doing, making jokes out of this whole thing.
[2067.64s -> 2069.64s]  Running around in circles.
[2074.44s -> 2079.35s]  Where did I go?
[2079.35s -> 2081.35s]  Did I, I just jumped out of frame?
[2089.75s -> 2091.75s]  Oh.
[2091.75s -> 2093.75s]  Oh shit, that was actually pretty bad.
[2093.75s -> 2095.75s]  That was scary.
[2101.66s -> 2104.86s]  Fucking spammer.
[2106.86s -> 2108.86s]  Here we go.
[2111.83s -> 2115.10s]  Block.
[2118.04s -> 2120.04s]  Oh shit.
[2120.04s -> 2124.97s]  Oh, damn it.
[2124.97s -> 2127.59s]  Switched.
[2133.34s -> 2135.34s]  The burger boy technique.
[2135.34s -> 2137.34s]  It's not a bad technique.
[2144.95s -> 2146.95s]  Oh, don't. I was trying not to stab him in the back.
[2146.95s -> 2150.22s]  Cause that's dishonorable.
[2152.22s -> 2154.22s]  Lifted up her left arm to dodge that somehow.
[2154.22s -> 2160.68s]  I'm going to go for a dab.
[2160.68s -> 2163.75s]  Holy shit.
[2165.75s -> 2173.62s]  Once they get cocky, that's when we go in.
[2175.62s -> 2177.62s]  I'm going to try to go for the other side.
[2177.62s -> 2182.68s]  Right here.
[2191.82s -> 2196.36s]  Shit.
[2196.36s -> 2199.86s]  We're getting into this though.
[2199.86s -> 2201.86s]  Counter attack.
[2201.86s -> 2203.86s]  We're getting into this though.
[2203.86s -> 2205.86s]  Counter attack.
[2205.86s -> 2207.86s]  After you block, you can't do anything for a second.
[2212.23s -> 2219.00s]  Okay, you get like a spin super move.
[2222.07s -> 2224.95s]  Where did you get that from?
[2224.95s -> 2226.95s]  I don't have one of those.
[2229.26s -> 2231.75s]  Helicopter attack.
[2233.75s -> 2236.63s]  Zangief.
[2236.63s -> 2238.63s]  Yeah.
[2246.81s -> 2251.80s]  This is not my kind of weapon.
[2251.80s -> 2253.80s]  It's like you're giving me a weapon.
[2253.80s -> 2255.80s]  I'll try.
[2257.80s -> 2260.81s]  I'm not changing stances.
[2260.81s -> 2262.81s]  I feel like that's bad right now.
[2268.57s -> 2270.57s]  Can you skip the replays? I can, but don't you guys want to see?
[2270.57s -> 2273.00s]  Yeah, after this I want to learn some actual techniques.
[2275.56s -> 2277.56s]  So let's see if I can complete the game without knowing anything.
[2281.74s -> 2285.70s]  How is your sword sharper than mine?
[2285.70s -> 2290.38s]  Are the directional inputs? Probably.
[2290.38s -> 2292.38s]  Because it looks like, hold on, let me see.
[2292.38s -> 2294.38s]  If I go down and like forward and...
[2298.74s -> 2303.35s]  I wasn't even looking at the screen.
[2303.35s -> 2305.35s]  I was looking at my controller.
[2311.37s -> 2313.37s]  I was like, wait, down and...
[2316.95s -> 2323.74s]  That's the secret.
[2323.74s -> 2325.74s]  Hahaha.
[2325.74s -> 2327.74s]  No.
[2329.74s -> 2331.74s]  I could have just ran and just slashed.
[2337.74s -> 2339.74s]  Right in his stomach.
[2346.42s -> 2348.42s]  He was like, please.
[2348.42s -> 2350.42s]  Please poke my stomach.
[2350.42s -> 2354.76s]  I did it.
[2356.76s -> 2358.76s]  Full motion video cutscene.
[2376.17s -> 2379.94s]  Wait, what are you talking about?
[2399.34s -> 2406.30s]  I have to go.
[2406.30s -> 2408.79s]  Now I'm all alone.
[2466.97s -> 2468.97s]  We're going to go into training.
[2468.97s -> 2470.97s]  Just curious, because I need to learn this for the next game.
[2470.97s -> 2472.97s]  And I have to pick a weapon that I care about.
[2474.97s -> 2485.93s]  Also, some maps you have to exit the map in a specific area mid-fight, really.
[2487.93s -> 2491.00s]  Going quality build, something like that.
[2497.59s -> 2499.59s]  Okay, so let's see.
[2499.59s -> 2501.59s]  So, circle.
[2503.59s -> 2505.59s]  You can do double dare.
[2505.59s -> 2507.59s]  What if I go like down and...
[2509.59s -> 2511.59s]  What if I go backwards?
[2511.59s -> 2513.59s]  Forward circle.
[2513.59s -> 2515.59s]  Forward circle.
[2517.59s -> 2519.59s]  So there's a double tap there.
[2519.59s -> 2521.59s]  X has...
[2521.59s -> 2523.59s]  Forward and X.
[2523.59s -> 2525.59s]  Down and X.
[2525.59s -> 2527.59s]  Back, X.
[2527.59s -> 2529.59s]  Up, X.
[2529.59s -> 2531.59s]  Forward, X.
[2531.59s -> 2533.59s]  Double tap, back, X.
[2533.59s -> 2538.73s]  I have to beat a hundred enemies in slash mode without dying to unlock the guy with the gun.
[2543.03s -> 2545.03s]  I wonder if, like, how about triangle, like circle?
[2545.03s -> 2547.03s]  Like circle, triangle.
[2553.72s -> 2555.72s]  Because that's locked.
[2555.72s -> 2557.72s]  Clearly.
[2560.54s -> 2565.19s]  Tap.
[2565.19s -> 2567.19s]  I mean, yeah, some of these don't tap.
[2567.19s -> 2571.69s]  I actually like holding like this.
[2575.69s -> 2577.69s]  Baseball stance, yeah.
[2577.69s -> 2579.69s]  You are really slow.
[2585.00s -> 2589.30s]  I'm trying to do those, like you guys say, directional and like a fucking...
[2589.30s -> 2595.19s]  Like, lower stance with R2, I think.
[2597.19s -> 2601.19s]  Oh shit, yeah, you can do high, mid, and low.
[2603.19s -> 2605.56s]  Damn, okay.
[2605.56s -> 2607.99s]  That's good to know.
[2612.98s -> 2616.06s]  Game is too loud.
[2616.06s -> 2618.49s]  I can't hear you.
[2618.49s -> 2620.49s]  Alright, sorry, I didn't know.
[2620.49s -> 2623.24s]  This is the first time music's been in the game.
[2623.24s -> 2625.24s]  Alright, how do I get out of this?
[2625.24s -> 2629.21s]  How do I get out of...
[2631.45s -> 2633.45s]  Check the game manual?
[2633.45s -> 2637.45s]  Yeah, I would have to go online for that because this did not come in the manual.
[2637.45s -> 2639.45s]  Alright, kill me, so I want to go to the slash mode.
[2642.45s -> 2646.99s]  Start, select, yeah, that's what I've been doing.
[2650.99s -> 2653.49s]  How about...
[2653.49s -> 2655.49s]  Start, select.
[2655.49s -> 2657.98s]  Select, start.
[2657.98s -> 2659.98s]  Start, select, and shoulder buttons.
[2664.08s -> 2668.02s]  Holy shit, you do have to press everything at the same time.
[2668.02s -> 2670.02s]  Okay.
[2670.02s -> 2672.02s]  Movie.
[2672.02s -> 2674.02s]  What is slash mode?
[2674.02s -> 2683.05s]  Let's see what that does.
[2685.25s -> 2688.13s]  Mikado.
[2688.13s -> 2690.13s]  I guess we have to do the katana.
[2690.13s -> 2693.58s]  I guess I can't pick.
[2693.58s -> 2695.58s]  Eat slash mode on hard without continuing.
[2695.58s -> 2698.34s]  Let's see how impossible that is.
[2698.34s -> 2700.34s]  We want cheats, we want cheats.
[2708.98s -> 2710.98s]  On it doesn't matter here.
[2710.98s -> 2713.22s]  I just think steamroller.
[2716.16s -> 2718.53s]  Alright, bring this down.
[2718.53s -> 2722.56s]  Bring this sword down, there we go.
[2722.56s -> 2724.56s]  Ooh, that's a good, I like that.
[2725.56s -> 2728.06s]  Okay, a hundred of these?
[2728.06s -> 2732.15s]  I mean, they are pretty dumb.
[2735.10s -> 2738.98s]  Although...
[2738.98s -> 2743.72s]  I actually don't like this weapon.
[2743.72s -> 2746.54s]  But I have to use it.
[2750.17s -> 2757.14s]  Okay.
[2757.14s -> 2759.14s]  Nope, he's alive.
[2759.14s -> 2762.92s]  Good.
[2762.92s -> 2764.92s]  We're going to try that technique a hundred times.
[2764.92s -> 2773.16s]  Don't kill me.
[2773.16s -> 2775.16s]  Alright, I broke his arm.
[2776.16s -> 2779.62s]  Good.
[2779.62s -> 2781.62s]  Okay, I think I can do this.
[2781.62s -> 2783.62s]  Holy shit, he must...
[2783.62s -> 2785.62s]  Thank god.
[2785.62s -> 2791.44s]  Don't block, don't kill me.
[2799.01s -> 2801.63s]  Did I just headbop him?
[2811.49s -> 2815.46s]  No, they get harder.
[2815.46s -> 2817.46s]  Oh boy.
[2817.46s -> 2819.46s]  Good thing I blocked that.
[2819.46s -> 2821.46s]  Oh, I'm dead. I got to nine.
[2823.02s -> 2828.50s]  You have to do that a hundred times, holy shit.
[2828.50s -> 2830.50s]  Wow.
[2830.50s -> 2833.25s]  It's just a gauntlet mode.
[2833.25s -> 2835.25s]  And you have to get to a hundred.
[2835.25s -> 2837.25s]  I can imagine getting to 99.
[2839.94s -> 2841.94s]  And hating myself.
[2841.94s -> 2844.62s]  Because I'm about to be lost.
[2849.98s -> 2851.98s]  Give him one more try.
[2857.12s -> 2861.34s]  We both did the same thing.
[2862.34s -> 2865.72s]  What is honor?
[2865.72s -> 2867.72s]  I don't need honor.
[2867.72s -> 2870.09s]  I'll go...
[2870.09s -> 2874.99s]  I'm just helping this guy tumble backwards over and over again.
[2874.99s -> 2877.99s]  How many more times do I have to do this?
[2877.99s -> 2895.99s]  I just did the thing that you do at the arcade when you're really mad that you lost and you don't have any coins left.
[2895.99s -> 2897.99s]  You just get to fucking zero.
[2897.99s -> 2899.99s]  No one else is going to have fun.
[2899.99s -> 2906.26s]  Let me see.
[2906.26s -> 2908.26s]  Bushido blade combos.
[2908.26s -> 2912.81s]  The mall to spam.
[2912.81s -> 2915.11s]  Here we go.
[2915.11s -> 2919.02s]  Move list.
[2919.02s -> 2921.02s]  I'm just curious.
[2921.02s -> 2923.51s]  General moves.
[2923.51s -> 2925.51s]  Square.
[2925.51s -> 2927.51s]  Square R2 is roll backwards.
[2927.51s -> 2931.75s]  Forward R2 is kneel pickup weapon.
[2931.75s -> 2934.38s]  Throw dirt.
[2934.38s -> 2936.38s]  There's a jump.
[2936.38s -> 2938.38s]  Forward R2 and then R1 is jump.
[2938.38s -> 2943.24s]  Hold on. You can do this too?
[2943.24s -> 2947.85s]  What happens if you do this?
[2947.85s -> 2949.85s]  Do a 100% dirt throw run.
[2949.85s -> 2965.27s]  Just use cheat codes.
[2965.27s -> 2969.94s]  Can I use the gun guy?
[2977.69s -> 2979.69s]  4.5 kilogram sword.
[2979.69s -> 2982.31s]  Throwing dirt is BM but it's lots of fun.
[2984.31s -> 2986.31s]  Let me try this.
[2986.31s -> 2988.31s]  And then we'll move on to Bushido blade 2.
[2988.31s -> 2990.31s]  Because Bushido blade 2 is just Bushido blade 1 but better.
[2990.31s -> 2992.31s]  With more stuff.
[2992.31s -> 2994.87s]  The gun guy is only available in two player mode.
[2994.87s -> 2996.87s]  Oh shit. Well...
[3000.71s -> 3002.71s]  Uh oh. That's not true.
[3002.71s -> 3004.71s]  Is it not true?
[3004.71s -> 3006.71s]  Oh shit.
[3006.71s -> 3008.71s]  It's literally worse.
[3008.71s -> 3011.66s]  It's worse.
[3013.66s -> 3017.69s]  I think it's worse.
[3017.69s -> 3019.69s]  Don't play 2.
[3019.69s -> 3021.69s]  I already bought it.
[3021.69s -> 3023.69s]  I'm not going to not play it.
[3028.28s -> 3030.52s]  It's right here.
[3030.52s -> 3032.89s]  What do you want me to do?
[3032.89s -> 3035.83s]  Recycle it?
[3044.09s -> 3049.40s]  Let's see.
[3049.40s -> 3051.40s]  Stop. I'm trying to boost dishonorable too.
[3051.40s -> 3053.40s]  Forward R2 R2.
[3058.25s -> 3061.00s]  Forward plus R2 and then R2.
[3064.65s -> 3066.65s]  Let's try it again.
[3069.40s -> 3071.83s]  Oh. There it was.
[3071.83s -> 3075.91s]  Kind of. Forward R2.
[3075.91s -> 3082.12s]  Uh. It's not working.
[3082.12s -> 3084.12s]  Forward R2 R2.
[3084.12s -> 3086.12s]  Forward R2 R2.
[3086.12s -> 3088.12s]  Forward R2.
[3088.12s -> 3090.12s]  It looks like he kneels down for a second.
[3090.12s -> 3098.87s]  Forward R2.
[3100.87s -> 3102.87s]  And then R2 is throw dirt.
[3102.87s -> 3105.75s]  Because forward R2 is kneel.
[3105.75s -> 3107.75s]  So when I kneel down I should...
[3107.75s -> 3109.75s]  Some moves are weapon dependent.
[3109.75s -> 3112.82s]  Oh shit.
[3112.82s -> 3115.90s]  This is one of the general moves.
[3115.90s -> 3118.39s]  Don't hit your opponent
[3118.39s -> 3120.39s]  when they're lying on the ground.
[3120.39s -> 3122.39s]  No whacking your opponent in the back.
[3122.39s -> 3124.39s]  Don't slice your opponent when they're climbing a wall.
[3124.39s -> 3126.39s]  No beheading your opponent before they are ready.
[3126.39s -> 3128.39s]  What do you mean beheading your opponent before they're ready?
[3128.39s -> 3130.70s]  No blinding your opponent by throwing something at them.
[3130.70s -> 3132.70s]  Dirt and snow etc.
[3132.70s -> 3141.96s]  Oh here we go. Hissou moves.
[3141.96s -> 3143.96s]  Looking for the rip here. There it is.
[3143.96s -> 3146.33s]  Okay. Triangle
[3146.33s -> 3148.33s]  from high stance.
[3148.33s -> 3153.26s]  Is this a high stance? What am I doing?
[3153.26s -> 3155.75s]  It looks like I'm juggling.
[3155.75s -> 3158.12s]  Okay.
[3158.12s -> 3161.13s]  Slash. So.
[3161.13s -> 3163.13s]  Here we go.
[3163.13s -> 3168.70s]  Circle circle.
[3168.70s -> 3170.70s]  X. Okay.
[3170.70s -> 3172.70s]  Middle stance. Let's just check it out. I need to learn this stuff.
[3172.70s -> 3176.86s]  Alright. Now let's get a big one.
[3176.86s -> 3181.27s]  Oooh.
[3181.27s -> 3183.69s]  Here we go.
[3183.69s -> 3186.18s]  Let's try it.
[3186.18s -> 3192.74s]  Nice.
[3192.74s -> 3194.74s]  Go back to the thing.
[3194.74s -> 3196.74s]  I already beat the thing. I can't throw that twice.
[3196.74s -> 3200.90s]  The last four hours of that game
[3200.90s -> 3202.90s]  was dog shit.
[3202.90s -> 3204.90s]  I don't want to do that again.
[3204.90s -> 3215.02s]  Play the game again
[3215.02s -> 3217.02s]  but do it backwards.
[3217.02s -> 3219.02s]  What do you mean put the controller backwards?
[3219.02s -> 3221.02s]  No.
[3221.02s -> 3223.02s]  Alright. Pursuit of Blade 2 is going in in just a minute.
[3223.02s -> 3225.77s]  I gotta have the...
[3225.77s -> 3228.01s]  Alright. Hold on.
[3228.01s -> 3230.01s]  Forward X. Circle. Triangle.
[3230.01s -> 3232.63s]  I'm gonna try this.
[3232.63s -> 3235.45s]  Forward X. Triangle. Triple slash.
[3241.78s -> 3247.16s]  Ah.
[3247.16s -> 3249.16s]  It's gonna be the same game but worse.
[3249.16s -> 3256.18s]  Will it?
[3256.18s -> 3258.62s]  Alright. It's going in.
[3258.62s -> 3261.43s]  I'm taking the bandaid off.
[3261.43s -> 3264.31s]  Let me try to do this one thing.
[3264.31s -> 3266.31s]  Am I in the wrong stance?
[3266.31s -> 3269.77s]  Yeah, I am.
[3271.77s -> 3276.25s]  Alright. Fuck it.
[3276.25s -> 3282.84s]  Take the second disc and snap it.
[3282.84s -> 3287.38s]  Alright.
[3287.38s -> 3289.38s]  I'm gonna be really upset with you guys if Pursuit of Blade 2
[3289.38s -> 3291.38s]  is much better.
[3291.38s -> 3293.69s]  If this game is really, really fun
[3293.69s -> 3295.69s]  and I love it, I'm gonna be upset.
[3295.69s -> 3297.69s]  Because you guys tried to get me to like
[3297.69s -> 3307.74s]  break it. It's actually
[3307.74s -> 3309.74s]  awful? No.
[3309.74s -> 3311.74s]  It can't be. The first one is fun
[3311.74s -> 3313.74s]  and interesting and cool. How would the second one be worse?
[3313.74s -> 3317.64s]  I guess this...
[3317.64s -> 3319.64s]  Yeah. Hold on. That's true. The sequel could be
[3319.64s -> 3325.85s]  always worse.
[3325.85s -> 3331.42s]  We're gonna try it though. Is it not
[3331.42s -> 3346.97s]  registered? There it is. People talking shit
[3346.97s -> 3348.97s]  about Dark Souls 2 are people who can't
[3348.97s -> 3350.97s]  beat Dark Souls without shields or sorcery.
[3350.97s -> 3355.05s]  What?
[3355.05s -> 3359.78s]  What does this have to do with anything?
[3359.78s -> 3363.75s]  It has nothing to do with what we're doing.
[3363.75s -> 3365.75s]  Just had to
[3365.75s -> 3375.42s]  get it off his chest.
[3375.42s -> 3377.42s]  The one guys are on a roll tonight.
[3377.42s -> 3384.33s]  Yeah, they are.
[3384.33s -> 3388.17s]  Oh, it's an example of a worse sequel.
[3388.17s -> 3403.21s]  I see where you're going. Is this the only
[3403.21s -> 3405.21s]  thing I'm gonna be doing tonight?
[3405.21s -> 3413.02s]  Probably not.
[3413.02s -> 3415.02s]  Because I can imagine this is probably gonna be like another
[3415.02s -> 3419.24s]  hour or so for this game.
[3419.24s -> 3421.24s]  And I do have Siren, but
[3421.24s -> 3423.24s]  should I start Siren after this?
[3423.24s -> 3425.24s]  That might be a mistake
[3425.24s -> 3427.24s]  because it's a long game.
[3427.24s -> 3429.24s]  And I'm gonna disappear as of tomorrow.
[3429.24s -> 3441.27s]  Dead Rising?
[3441.27s -> 3443.27s]  No, no. I wanna...
[3443.27s -> 3445.27s]  No, I can't. No.
[3445.27s -> 3447.27s]  That's gonna be a string of at least
[3447.27s -> 3449.27s]  a couple of streams in a row.
[3449.27s -> 3456.31s]  You just disappeared for
[3456.31s -> 3458.31s]  a week. Well, this is to set up the Halloween stream.
[3458.31s -> 3461.32s]  Because I'm traveling for the Halloween
[3461.32s -> 3463.32s]  stream. If you didn't know, I'm going to the East Coast to do it.
[3463.32s -> 3479.90s]  Am I gonna play horror games
[3479.90s -> 3481.90s]  after Halloween? Probably not.
[3481.90s -> 3484.84s]  There are like one or two that I'd
[3484.84s -> 3486.84s]  like to do, but we've done
[3486.84s -> 3488.84s]  a lot of scare games.
[3488.84s -> 3493.13s]  Horror Thanksgiving.
[3493.13s -> 3504.89s]  Oh, okay.
[3504.89s -> 3506.89s]  I was gonna say I can't read this.
[3506.89s -> 3519.42s]  Alright, hold on.
[3519.42s -> 3521.42s]  Master your weapon. Let's do this.
[3521.42s -> 3528.71s]  Practice. Train with the ninja.
[3528.71s -> 3530.71s]  Adjust the ninja's fighting pattern by pressing...
[3530.71s -> 3532.71s]  Okay. Yeah.
[3532.71s -> 3539.88s]  There's a lot of secret characters in
[3539.88s -> 3541.88s]  this one.
[3541.88s -> 3550.50s]  I wanna be...
[3550.50s -> 3555.69s]  I guess I'll be you.
[3555.69s -> 3561.90s]  Spear? I'm doing spear.
[3561.90s -> 3566.89s]  Oh, and you can do Tatana, whatever.
[3566.89s -> 3574.95s]  The longer, the better. That's right.
[3574.95s -> 3584.68s]  Frontal attacks.
[3584.68s -> 3587.30s]  Off, off, off. Okay.
[3587.30s -> 3590.25s]  So.
[3590.25s -> 3594.54s]  Holy shit, this thing is huge.
[3594.54s -> 3596.54s]  Alright, so square has changed the
[3596.54s -> 3599.42s]  stance of this one.
[3599.42s -> 3601.91s]  Alright.
[3601.91s -> 3603.91s]  I feel like I don't have to do anything with this.
[3603.91s -> 3606.52s]  Do a swipe.
[3606.52s -> 3608.52s]  Oh, wow.
[3608.52s -> 3610.52s]  Okay, so X.
[3610.52s -> 3612.52s]  I can go bang, bang, bang.
[3614.52s -> 3617.34s]  Is there no blood in this one?
[3617.34s -> 3624.89s]  The stage doesn't look finished.
[3624.89s -> 3626.89s]  It's just a training stage.
[3626.89s -> 3630.15s]  This is lame. No blood.
[3630.15s -> 3633.03s]  Hold on.
[3633.03s -> 3635.03s]  Since there's no longer a parry button,
[3635.03s -> 3637.03s]  in Bushido Blade II,
[3637.03s -> 3639.03s]  you must learn to use the attack buttons to parry.
[3639.03s -> 3642.23s]  Oh.
[3642.23s -> 3644.23s]  Is this why everyone doesn't like it?
[3644.23s -> 3646.66s]  When the opponent attacks
[3646.66s -> 3648.66s]  with X, hit O
[3648.66s -> 3650.66s]  just before the attack. When the opponent
[3650.66s -> 3652.66s]  attacks with circle, hit X to counter.
[3652.66s -> 3655.61s]  Okay.
[3655.61s -> 3657.61s]  Well, that's good to know that there's no parry.
[3657.61s -> 3659.61s]  Like, a parry button.
[3661.61s -> 3663.61s]  God, I love spears.
[3663.61s -> 3665.85s]  No blood. No blood.
[3665.85s -> 3668.86s]  No blood.
[3668.86s -> 3670.86s]  There's an actual dedicated jump button, though.
[3677.78s -> 3683.03s]  Alright, that's pretty cool.
[3683.03s -> 3685.34s]  Oh, that's sick.
[3685.34s -> 3687.77s]  Oh, yeah. Oh, two is
[3687.77s -> 3689.77s]  way better than one.
[3694.26s -> 3696.70s]  Alright, I think I can do it.
[3696.70s -> 3699.37s]  But there's the whole other thing called rebound attacks.
[3699.37s -> 3708.12s]  When an attack hits the opponent's weapon,
[3708.12s -> 3711.19s]  a pink flash will appear.
[3711.19s -> 3713.19s]  When this happens, both the attacker and the defender
[3713.19s -> 3715.82s]  can follow up with a rebound attack.
[3715.82s -> 3717.82s]  So if you're attacking and this happens,
[3717.82s -> 3719.82s]  you press circle.
[3719.82s -> 3721.82s]  Okay.
[3721.82s -> 3724.82s]  Okay.
[3724.82s -> 3726.82s]  When this happens, you press circle.
[3726.82s -> 3729.06s]  If you're defending,
[3729.06s -> 3731.06s]  if I'm hit, it's X.
[3731.06s -> 3733.06s]  There it is.
[3736.31s -> 3738.31s]  Where am I reading this?
[3738.31s -> 3740.31s]  In the game's online
[3740.31s -> 3742.31s]  manual.
[3747.35s -> 3749.35s]  That's cheating. I'm reading the game's
[3749.35s -> 3751.66s]  manual. Alright, weapon clash.
[3751.66s -> 3753.66s]  When two attacks meet, a weapon clash will occur.
[3753.66s -> 3755.66s]  A weapon clash has three phases.
[3755.66s -> 3759.42s]  Yay.
[3759.42s -> 3761.42s]  Neutral, advantage, and overpowering.
[3761.42s -> 3763.42s]  In any phase, is this just a spam button?
[3763.42s -> 3765.42s]  Like, press it as fast as you can?
[3765.42s -> 3767.42s]  In any phase, either player
[3767.42s -> 3769.42s]  must hit the attack buttons more quickly than the
[3769.42s -> 3771.42s]  other in any order to gain the advantage.
[3771.42s -> 3773.42s]  I win. I will never lose
[3773.42s -> 3776.94s]  one of those. Okay.
[3776.94s -> 3779.94s]  So now,
[3779.94s -> 3783.27s]  what's this thing called?
[3783.27s -> 3785.27s]  It's not called the spear.
[3785.27s -> 3787.27s]  Oh, there it is.
[3787.27s -> 3789.51s]  Okay.
[3789.51s -> 3792.52s]  I'm ready.
[3792.52s -> 3804.86s]  Top menu.
[3804.86s -> 3806.86s]  Story mode. Here we go.
[3806.86s -> 3808.86s]  You can do POV story mode. That's kind of insane.
[3817.03s -> 3820.68s]  Insane.
[3824.68s -> 3827.05s]  800 years ago.
[3827.05s -> 3829.05s]  100 years ago.
[3838.34s -> 3840.34s]  It's kind of hard to read.
[3842.34s -> 3847.78s]  Was honor in this game too?
[3849.78s -> 3851.78s]  How does honor work in this one?
[3867.42s -> 3869.42s]  There's nothing on
[3869.42s -> 3871.42s]  Bushida Blade 2's honor system.
[3876.33s -> 3878.33s]  There is no honor in Bushida Blade 2.
[3881.19s -> 3883.19s]  Why would they do that?
[3894.30s -> 3896.30s]  You actually cannot fight honorably or you lose.
[3903.35s -> 3905.35s]  Cave on the left.
[3912.17s -> 3921.64s]  Okay.
[3921.64s -> 3923.64s]  So, I'm going to just do the same
[3923.64s -> 3928.95s]  thing?
[3928.95s -> 3936.95s]  I think I have a good understanding of what's going on.
[3936.95s -> 3942.97s]  I'm on Tutorial Island.
[3945.27s -> 3947.27s]  Moisac.
[3957.93s -> 3959.93s]  Who's talking to you?
[3963.00s -> 3971.18s]  What?
[3971.18s -> 3973.18s]  I'm speaking from above in the
[3973.18s -> 3975.18s]  rafters.
[3975.18s -> 3977.18s]  I could just come down and meet you.
[3977.18s -> 3979.67s]  But, holy shit,
[3979.67s -> 3981.67s]  worse than one.
[3981.67s -> 3983.67s]  Look at that fucking fake virtual fighter
[3983.67s -> 3986.10s]  blood.
[3986.10s -> 3992.74s]  How do you do that?
[3992.74s -> 3998.57s]  He'll never win one of those.
[3998.57s -> 4000.57s]  It'll never happen.
[4009.51s -> 4011.51s]  Right in the head.
[4011.51s -> 4013.51s]  Oh, what?
[4013.51s -> 4015.51s]  That was right in the head.
[4025.03s -> 4027.03s]  You probably shouldn't have
[4027.03s -> 4029.03s]  did that, but it's okay.
[4029.03s -> 4031.91s]  How many times do I have to do this
[4031.91s -> 4036.26s]  to prove myself?
[4036.26s -> 4038.57s]  I'm going in with
[4038.57s -> 4040.57s]  the slide thing.
[4040.57s -> 4043.64s]  Nice.
[4043.64s -> 4045.64s]  Can I?
[4052.01s -> 4054.01s]  Alright.
[4066.06s -> 4068.06s]  By the way, Dad, can we get some furniture
[4068.06s -> 4070.06s]  in the living room? The echo is
[4070.06s -> 4072.06s]  really, really fucking strong.
[4081.38s -> 4085.03s]  Instantly got him.
[4085.03s -> 4087.78s]  Wait, we're going again?
[4087.78s -> 4090.41s]  You'll never win.
[4100.60s -> 4102.95s]  Oops.
[4102.95s -> 4104.95s]  He broke my arm, but it doesn't matter.
[4104.95s -> 4106.95s]  I can do this with one hand.
[4106.95s -> 4108.95s]  Oh shit, one handed.
[4108.95s -> 4110.95s]  Right in the face. Just let him walk into it.
[4110.95s -> 4112.95s]  He'll walk into it.
[4115.13s -> 4117.13s]  Spare is the best weapon.
[4129.40s -> 4135.40s]  Okay, for a second,
[4135.40s -> 4137.40s]  I thought he was standing up.
[4137.40s -> 4144.06s]  I was like, oh, my arm is still broken.
[4148.02s -> 4150.02s]  That was a smart play.
[4156.30s -> 4159.43s]  See ya.
[4159.43s -> 4161.43s]  I'll never understand that stance.
[4161.43s -> 4163.43s]  The stance we're both doing.
[4167.53s -> 4169.53s]  Why hold your hands up?
[4169.53s -> 4171.53s]  The vital organs are like in your armpits.
[4171.53s -> 4173.53s]  If you get slashed in the armpits...
[4183.45s -> 4185.45s]  What?
[4190.39s -> 4192.39s]  Oh.
[4192.39s -> 4194.39s]  Good to see ya again.
[4196.39s -> 4199.02s]  I do doubt ya.
[4199.02s -> 4202.73s]  Not gonna pull a gun out on me, are ya?
[4202.73s -> 4208.10s]  He's like...
[4208.10s -> 4213.35s]  He's dressed.
[4213.35s -> 4215.35s]  Wait.
[4215.35s -> 4217.35s]  It's me now.
[4217.35s -> 4220.60s]  What if I just lose?
[4220.60s -> 4222.60s]  Oh, you suck. You're not fast enough.
[4235.06s -> 4239.27s]  Oops.
[4239.27s -> 4241.27s]  I was...
[4244.02s -> 4246.02s]  Is he dying?
[4249.80s -> 4256.14s]  That's fucking funny.
[4256.14s -> 4258.14s]  All right, hold on.
[4258.14s -> 4260.70s]  There's a different ending, I think.
[4260.70s -> 4264.28s]  Why did I give him the spear?
[4264.28s -> 4266.28s]  I didn't know how to use this shit.
[4268.71s -> 4270.71s]  Here, let me see that weapon.
[4270.71s -> 4272.89s]  I have no idea how to use.
[4272.89s -> 4274.89s]  It can't be that hard.
[4274.89s -> 4276.89s]  He's just sticking with the end that's sharp.
[4276.89s -> 4283.59s]  Why would you charge a guy with a spear like that?
[4283.59s -> 4285.59s]  Mistake.
[4285.59s -> 4288.34s]  Too flashy.
[4288.34s -> 4291.93s]  Too flashy.
[4291.93s -> 4293.93s]  Just go back to basics.
[4295.93s -> 4300.14s]  Spears are seriously the best weapon.
[4300.14s -> 4303.40s]  Oh, shit.
[4303.40s -> 4306.28s]  What happens if I die?
[4306.28s -> 4308.28s]  We're good.
[4308.28s -> 4314.02s]  Already broke my fucking arm.
[4321.18s -> 4324.95s]  Cross it.
[4324.95s -> 4326.95s]  There it is.
[4326.95s -> 4328.95s]  Dumb.
[4328.95s -> 4334.18s]  I didn't even do anything. He just ran into it.
[4334.18s -> 4336.68s]  Same thing.
[4336.68s -> 4338.68s]  I'm like a spike trap on the wall.
[4338.68s -> 4340.68s]  Sorry.
[4340.68s -> 4346.42s]  As long as I'm here, you won't be going any further.
[4346.42s -> 4348.42s]  Okay.
[4348.42s -> 4351.75s]  Why are we fighting in a...
[4351.75s -> 4353.75s]  Oh, hold on.
[4353.75s -> 4355.75s]  Why are we in a parking garage?
[4355.75s -> 4357.75s]  I'm just realizing this right now.
[4357.75s -> 4359.75s]  Weren't we like 800 years ago?
[4359.75s -> 4361.75s]  Wait.
[4361.75s -> 4363.75s]  This is 800 years ago.
[4363.75s -> 4366.31s]  What?
[4366.31s -> 4369.19s]  What?
[4369.19s -> 4376.81s]  I can't even...
[4376.81s -> 4378.81s]  Okay, let's go.
[4378.81s -> 4381.24s]  You gotta start back here.
[4381.24s -> 4383.24s]  Right there.
[4385.24s -> 4387.24s]  Boom.
[4387.24s -> 4389.24s]  Triple combo.
[4389.24s -> 4392.50s]  They're LARPing in a parking lot.
[4400.82s -> 4411.90s]  That guy's just died.
[4411.90s -> 4413.90s]  Live action roll.
[4413.90s -> 4416.90s]  They actually added a person with
[4416.90s -> 4418.90s]  an assault rifle.
[4423.83s -> 4427.10s]  Okay.
[4427.10s -> 4429.10s]  Parking garage's assault rifle.
[4433.26s -> 4435.26s]  She blocked my sword with the gun.
[4435.26s -> 4437.26s]  And then shot me.
[4437.26s -> 4441.54s]  Of course.
[4447.86s -> 4455.14s]  Kill, kill, kill, kill.
[4455.14s -> 4457.14s]  Kill, kill, kill.
[4457.14s -> 4459.14s]  Kill.
[4459.14s -> 4461.14s]  She was missing me at point blank.
[4461.14s -> 4463.14s]  Get her.
[4463.14s -> 4467.18s]  Oh my god, she's so bad.
[4467.18s -> 4469.18s]  Kill her.
[4491.29s -> 4498.89s]  Ugh.
[4498.89s -> 4503.11s]  The eye died.
[4503.11s -> 4507.53s]  The eye died.
[4507.53s -> 4509.53s]  Stewie grimace.
[4514.22s -> 4516.22s]  Ha ha ha.
[4516.22s -> 4518.22s]  This sounds like
[4518.22s -> 4520.22s]  me. I was gonna say
[4520.22s -> 4522.22s]  I do this voice a lot for
[4522.22s -> 4524.22s]  Nuke.
[4524.22s -> 4526.22s]  I do this voice a lot.
[4526.22s -> 4528.22s]  It's coming to me. Fist punch.
[4528.22s -> 4530.22s]  I do this one all the time.
[4530.22s -> 4534.18s]  Can you really handle a sword?
[4534.18s -> 4536.18s]  No.
[4536.18s -> 4541.69s]  That's why I use a spear.
[4541.69s -> 4546.55s]  Die.
[4546.55s -> 4548.55s]  Let's do a whirlwind attack.
[4548.55s -> 4550.98s]  Ooh, got him right in the
[4550.98s -> 4552.98s]  toe.
[4552.98s -> 4554.98s]  He doesn't have honor anymore.
[4558.98s -> 4561.67s]  Bring it up.
[4561.67s -> 4565.06s]  Let him walk into it.
[4565.06s -> 4567.06s]  Bingo.
[4571.69s -> 4577.58s]  You giddy.
[4577.58s -> 4579.58s]  A sword made for the sole purpose
[4579.58s -> 4584.57s]  of revenge.
[4584.57s -> 4592.95s]  It sounds like Michael Jackson.
[4592.95s -> 4594.95s]  Pretty good.
[4594.95s -> 4596.95s]  You've made it this far without losing your breath.
[4596.95s -> 4600.89s]  Oh, Utamaro.
[4600.89s -> 4603.06s]  I mean like, exactly.
[4603.06s -> 4605.06s]  Damn.
[4605.06s -> 4607.06s]  You've outdone me again.
[4607.06s -> 4610.31s]  This is nothing.
[4610.31s -> 4612.31s]  Besides, it's not
[4612.31s -> 4616.22s]  over yet.
[4616.22s -> 4618.22s]  Yeah, undoubtedly.
[4618.22s -> 4620.22s]  Unless we sever the enemy's bloodline, we won't reach
[4620.22s -> 4622.22s]  our true goal. Where's your weapon?
[4622.22s -> 4624.22s]  Vengeance to settle this prolonged
[4624.22s -> 4626.97s]  hatred? Revenge
[4626.97s -> 4628.97s]  is nothing to do with me, but I suppose
[4628.97s -> 4631.14s]  it can't be helped.
[4631.14s -> 4633.14s]  Well, I suppose I'll
[4633.14s -> 4635.14s]  help you. You can pay me back
[4635.14s -> 4637.14s]  later. Hear me?
[4637.14s -> 4648.28s]  I'll go on ahead.
[4648.28s -> 4653.53s]  Okay.
[4653.53s -> 4655.53s]  This is called the Tartar Shrine
[4655.53s -> 4657.53s]  path. Wait, what?
[4659.96s -> 4661.96s]  Why does he keep changing characters on me?
[4661.96s -> 4664.52s]  Wait, what?
[4664.52s -> 4666.82s]  Bring it down.
[4666.82s -> 4669.64s]  Bring it straight in.
[4674.33s -> 4676.33s]  Oh, that guy got
[4676.33s -> 4679.21s]  fucking destroyed.
[4683.45s -> 4685.45s]  Oh, what happened to your arm?
[4685.45s -> 4687.45s]  You okay?
[4687.45s -> 4691.22s]  Something wrong?
[4691.22s -> 4693.22s]  Oh, got it.
[4693.22s -> 4696.81s]  Again, we go. Okay. Let's go down.
[4705.18s -> 4707.18s]  Oof.
[4707.18s -> 4709.67s]  I felt that one.
[4709.67s -> 4713.13s]  I've been looking for a good challenge.
[4713.13s -> 4715.13s]  Oh, yeah.
[4715.13s -> 4717.13s]  I've been looking for a good challenge.
[4717.13s -> 4719.13s]  Oh, yeah.
[4719.13s -> 4721.13s]  I've been looking for a good challenge.
[4721.13s -> 4728.17s]  I've been looking for a good challenge.
[4728.17s -> 4730.17s]  I've been looking for a good challenge.
[4730.17s -> 4732.34s]  Oh, yeah.
[4732.34s -> 4734.34s]  I'm only Matsumushi and I'm just passing through the area.
[4734.34s -> 4736.34s]  Why are you holding onto your hair?
[4736.34s -> 4738.65s]  I might not be worth your effort.
[4738.65s -> 4740.65s]  That's what I do. I do that. I get it.
[4740.65s -> 4743.46s]  Down you go!
[4743.46s -> 4745.46s]  Take that!
[4745.46s -> 4747.46s]  Take that!
[4747.46s -> 4749.46s]  Take that!
[4749.46s -> 4755.74s]  Take that!
[4755.74s -> 4758.74s]  Take that!
[4758.74s -> 4760.74s]  Take that!
[4760.74s -> 4762.74s]  Take that!
[4762.74s -> 4765.18s]  Low. Can I do it low?
[4765.18s -> 4768.06s]  Okay. Sweet.
[4768.06s -> 4770.06s]  Take that!
[4770.06s -> 4773.11s]  Take that!
[4773.11s -> 4775.42s]  Die! Take that!
[4775.42s -> 4777.42s]  Come on, you can do better than that.
[4777.42s -> 4779.42s]  Got it. One more.
[4779.42s -> 4782.47s]  Down you go!
[4782.47s -> 4784.47s]  Take that!
[4784.47s -> 4786.47s]  Take that!
[4786.47s -> 4788.47s]  Die! Take that!
[4788.47s -> 4793.27s]  I'll leave the rest up to you.
[4793.27s -> 4796.47s]  So, alright.
[4796.47s -> 4806.52s]  I go back to me?
[4806.52s -> 4809.34s]  No, me.
[4809.34s -> 4812.73s]  That was a good damage hit.
[4812.73s -> 4815.66s]  That was a good damage hit.
[4815.66s -> 4819.22s]  Do it again.
[4819.22s -> 4822.04s]  Do it again.
[4822.04s -> 4824.04s]  Swing it down.
[4824.04s -> 4826.04s]  Swing it down.
[4826.04s -> 4828.60s]  And...
[4828.60s -> 4830.97s]  Oh!
[4830.97s -> 4833.27s]  His arm.
[4833.27s -> 4835.27s]  I love that combo.
[4835.27s -> 4837.27s]  I love that combo.
[4837.27s -> 4839.83s]  What?
[4839.83s -> 4842.97s]  What?
[4842.97s -> 4848.14s]  What?
[4848.14s -> 4850.70s]  What?
[4850.70s -> 4852.70s]  Oops.
[4852.70s -> 4854.70s]  Don't.
[4854.70s -> 4859.11s]  Don't.
[4859.11s -> 4863.51s]  Don't.
[4863.51s -> 4865.51s]  I do like the fact that they give you these little...
[4865.51s -> 4868.01s]  Hold on. Let me just instant one of those.
[4868.01s -> 4871.26s]  Hmm.
[4871.26s -> 4873.26s]  Hmm.
[4873.26s -> 4876.20s]  Hmm.
[4876.20s -> 4878.20s]  There's a little, like, fist bash at the end of that.
[4878.20s -> 4880.20s]  Oh.
[4880.20s -> 4884.04s]  Oh.
[4884.04s -> 4886.60s]  Bring it down.
[4886.60s -> 4888.60s]  I like the down.
[4888.60s -> 4890.60s]  Gives you the opportunity to get killed.
[4890.60s -> 4892.60s]  Because you get too greedy and do the same thing.
[4892.60s -> 4898.55s]  Hmm.
[4898.55s -> 4901.48s]  Already broken arm.
[4901.48s -> 4903.48s]  Already broken arm.
[4903.48s -> 4905.48s]  Already.
[4905.48s -> 4908.17s]  Right in the chest.
[4908.17s -> 4910.54s]  Right in the chest.
[4910.54s -> 4916.09s]  Get it!
[4916.09s -> 4919.35s]  Get it! Come on!
[4919.35s -> 4921.35s]  No!
[4921.35s -> 4924.15s]  They're getting smarter.
[4924.15s -> 4928.76s]  Hmm.
[4928.76s -> 4930.76s]  Why am I killing these people? I really have no idea.
[4943.83s -> 4946.20s]  What the fuck?
[4946.20s -> 4950.04s]  What's that weapon?
[4950.04s -> 4952.41s]  Hold on. Your weapon's cooler than mine.
[4952.41s -> 4954.41s]  You got, like, the ten cards in the iPad game
[4954.41s -> 4956.41s]  that are my weapon and then I pay, like, four dollars
[4956.41s -> 4958.41s]  and it upgrades into that one.
[4958.41s -> 4960.58s]  I want that one.
[4960.58s -> 4963.72s]  Hmm.
[4963.72s -> 4972.07s]  Hmm.
[4972.07s -> 4974.70s]  Ooh, that would've been a great counter.
[4974.70s -> 4976.70s]  So would that.
[4976.70s -> 4986.66s]  You could've chose it in the beginning.
[4986.66s -> 4989.22s]  I stick with what I have.
[4989.22s -> 4991.22s]  Oh my god.
[4991.22s -> 4993.53s]  She just took out my whole entire thing.
[4993.53s -> 4995.53s]  Zorax, whatever it's called.
[4995.53s -> 4999.05s]  No, that's an ant.
[4999.05s -> 5001.05s]  That's like an ant's body.
[5001.05s -> 5003.05s]  The thing in your throat.
[5003.05s -> 5010.25s]  Hmm.
[5010.25s -> 5013.13s]  You're long, too.
[5013.13s -> 5015.13s]  So it's fair. I don't like this.
[5015.13s -> 5018.01s]  The larynx. There it is.
[5020.01s -> 5022.01s]  Oh, I tried to do, like, the scoop
[5022.01s -> 5024.01s]  but I couldn't get you with it.
[5024.01s -> 5027.40s]  I'm too slow.
[5027.40s -> 5036.02s]  Right in the middle.
[5036.02s -> 5038.46s]  What are you doing?
[5038.46s -> 5040.46s]  Excuse me.
[5040.46s -> 5043.45s]  What?
[5043.45s -> 5046.14s]  That was fucking stupid.
[5046.14s -> 5048.14s]  You would cut your hands up so much.
[5048.14s -> 5050.14s]  Alright, let's end this.
[5050.14s -> 5058.33s]  You got too cocky.
[5058.33s -> 5062.42s]  The end is near.
[5066.52s -> 5074.52s]  Always without the weapon, too.
[5074.52s -> 5077.34s]  You just find a new one.
[5077.34s -> 5079.96s]  I suggest you give up.
[5079.96s -> 5081.96s]  The Naru Kagami have protected the Kagami lineage
[5081.96s -> 5083.96s]  for a very long time.
[5083.96s -> 5085.96s]  I cannot allow you to make an end of it.
[5085.96s -> 5095.30s]  Okay.
[5101.43s -> 5103.43s]  Uh, I guess what?
[5103.43s -> 5105.43s]  The guy has magic powers.
[5111.43s -> 5113.43s]  Okay.
[5125.08s -> 5127.08s]  Okay.
[5127.08s -> 5129.77s]  I think I have to counter him.
[5132.07s -> 5134.07s]  Yeah, I have to counter him.
[5138.82s -> 5140.82s]  Alright, I have to wait until he attacks
[5140.82s -> 5142.82s]  and then counter him.
[5144.82s -> 5148.98s]  How the fuck do I do this?
[5148.98s -> 5151.22s]  Why would I see that little flash?
[5151.22s -> 5153.66s]  I gotta counter it.
[5153.66s -> 5155.66s]  So, like, wham.
[5155.66s -> 5157.66s]  And...
[5157.66s -> 5159.66s]  counter.
[5163.24s -> 5165.54s]  Maybe he'll run out of mana.
[5184.68s -> 5186.68s]  Damn it.
[5186.68s -> 5189.94s]  He's running out of mana.
[5189.94s -> 5191.94s]  His teleport gets shorter and shorter.
[5191.94s -> 5194.25s]  For real?
[5203.53s -> 5205.53s]  He's probably in, like, a false insecure...
[5205.53s -> 5207.53s]  Alright. That was a pretty cool move,
[5207.53s -> 5212.97s]  but...
[5216.28s -> 5219.08s]  How did that not hit him?
[5219.08s -> 5221.77s]  Fuck.
[5221.77s -> 5226.50s]  It looks the same. Yeah.
[5226.50s -> 5228.50s]  No, I'm gonna have to counter
[5228.50s -> 5230.50s]  or something.
[5230.50s -> 5232.50s]  Like that, but...
[5246.71s -> 5248.71s]  How's that for magic powers?
[5248.71s -> 5250.71s]  Oh!
[5250.71s -> 5252.71s]  Damn it.
[5252.71s -> 5254.71s]  Come on. How did I miss him?
[5254.71s -> 5268.34s]  I, like, grazed his ear.
[5268.34s -> 5271.61s]  He blocked it on the ground.
[5276.60s -> 5278.60s]  He's blocking them on the ground.
[5278.60s -> 5281.61s]  How are you doing that?
[5281.61s -> 5283.61s]  Alright, low.
[5293.69s -> 5303.22s]  Get over here.
[5306.59s -> 5308.59s]  That was... I parried and countered.
[5308.59s -> 5310.59s]  What happened?
[5320.69s -> 5322.69s]  This is a nice boss theme.
[5322.69s -> 5326.02s]  Yeah.
[5326.02s -> 5328.64s]  The crickets and the owl
[5328.64s -> 5332.10s]  stand perfectly still.
[5339.71s -> 5341.71s]  Why would I do that?
[5346.92s -> 5350.82s]  Alright, I'm gonna try to block.
[5350.82s -> 5354.47s]  Okay, he swings. I'm gonna swing with circle.
[5354.47s -> 5357.86s]  And then hit X.
[5359.86s -> 5361.86s]  No, it was...
[5361.86s -> 5363.86s]  That was X.
[5367.38s -> 5369.38s]  Only attack when the owls hoot.
[5371.38s -> 5379.83s]  Do something!
[5379.83s -> 5381.83s]  Please! Do anything!
[5386.34s -> 5388.52s]  I mean, he's...
[5388.52s -> 5390.52s]  He's almost like he's too far away to counter.
[5392.52s -> 5394.82s]  I like... Hold on.
[5396.82s -> 5398.82s]  I like the... Hold on.
[5398.82s -> 5400.82s]  Let me try this again. He's on the ground.
[5400.82s -> 5402.82s]  I just have to, like, sweep the ground.
[5411.61s -> 5413.61s]  I googled it.
[5413.61s -> 5415.61s]  You need to hit him enough times so he teleports next to you, then...
[5415.61s -> 5421.94s]  What?
[5421.94s -> 5423.94s]  Hit him enough times until he teleports next to you?
[5423.94s -> 5425.94s]  And then stab him?
[5431.91s -> 5435.30s]  Okay, hold on.
[5439.30s -> 5441.30s]  Is he getting closer?
[5443.30s -> 5445.30s]  Did I hit him or did he hit me?
[5445.30s -> 5447.30s]  I can't tell.
[5455.30s -> 5458.06s]  Oh, come on.
[5458.06s -> 5460.06s]  Come on.
[5460.06s -> 5463.26s]  Come on.
[5465.26s -> 5467.26s]  He's definitely not getting closer.
[5467.26s -> 5469.26s]  Are we sure?
[5472.57s -> 5474.57s]  I need to, like, this one.
[5474.57s -> 5476.81s]  Because then I can just go, stab, run.
[5480.81s -> 5482.81s]  Kick him.
[5482.81s -> 5484.81s]  How do you kick?
[5484.81s -> 5487.43s]  Google says he gets closer.
[5487.43s -> 5489.43s]  If you get stuck on this, you can play the first one again.
[5489.43s -> 5491.61s]  What? Kick.
[5493.61s -> 5496.79s]  What's the kick?
[5496.79s -> 5498.79s]  This jump. What if I jump?
[5503.48s -> 5505.48s]  You have to hit him until he teleports
[5505.48s -> 5507.48s]  next to you, then kill him there.
[5507.48s -> 5509.48s]  So, yeah, I was doing it right.
[5509.48s -> 5511.48s]  He definitely is getting closer.
[5511.48s -> 5513.48s]  There's no way he's not.
[5513.48s -> 5515.48s]  Yeah, he is.
[5522.84s -> 5524.84s]  He is.
[5524.84s -> 5526.84s]  He is.
[5526.84s -> 5528.84s]  There he is.
[5528.84s -> 5530.84s]  Don't you fucking
[5530.84s -> 5532.84s]  dare.
[5532.84s -> 5534.84s]  Okay, now?
[5536.84s -> 5538.84s]  Don't fucking die.
[5545.21s -> 5547.21s]  God damn it, he did kill
[5547.21s -> 5549.21s]  my god.
[5560.07s -> 5562.07s]  You're a real pain in the ass, do you know that?
[5576.95s -> 5585.14s]  Don't you dare.
[5585.14s -> 5587.14s]  Alright, that's a good one. That's a good one.
[5587.14s -> 5589.14s]  I like this one. It's more defense.
[5597.29s -> 5599.29s]  Don't do the third
[5599.29s -> 5601.29s]  attack. It's not worth it.
[5601.29s -> 5603.85s]  Alright, I countered
[5603.85s -> 5605.85s]  and parried and he went further away.
[5608.73s -> 5610.73s]  No, please, please, please, please.
[5610.73s -> 5612.73s]  No, stop it.
[5612.73s -> 5614.73s]  He keeps, like, sidestepping me.
[5617.29s -> 5622.15s]  Why is he getting further away?
[5629.13s -> 5631.13s]  Oh, shit, he's right behind me.
[5634.20s -> 5636.20s]  You...
[5636.20s -> 5641.19s]  Oh, come on.
[5643.19s -> 5645.19s]  Oh, come on.
[5650.81s -> 5656.06s]  So you have to do that until he is
[5656.06s -> 5658.06s]  actually right next to your body.
[5660.06s -> 5662.06s]  Is this the boss of the game?
[5676.17s -> 5678.17s]  Swing the spear instead of poking him.
[5678.17s -> 5680.17s]  But look at how vulnerable I am.
[5686.55s -> 5688.73s]  This is stupid.
[5708.34s -> 5710.34s]  Oh my fucking god.
[5710.34s -> 5713.35s]  Just throw sand at him?
[5726.02s -> 5728.02s]  Alright, here we go, come on.
[5728.02s -> 5730.02s]  Okay, cool.
[5730.02s -> 5732.02s]  Fun.
[5732.02s -> 5734.33s]  Great.
[5738.33s -> 5740.50s]  Okay, fun.
[5740.50s -> 5742.50s]  This is fun.
[5742.50s -> 5744.50s]  Oh my god, okay, he can't be doing it
[5744.50s -> 5746.50s]  that many more times, right?
[5754.87s -> 5756.87s]  Fuck, you don't...
[5758.87s -> 5760.87s]  Die!
[5760.87s -> 5762.87s]  Oh my fucking god.
[5764.87s -> 5766.87s]  Jesus Christ.
[5768.87s -> 5771.11s]  Oh, he...
[5773.99s -> 5779.10s]  Have I actually hit him once?
[5779.10s -> 5787.48s]  No, because you have to hit him
[5787.48s -> 5789.48s]  until apparently he teleports
[5789.48s -> 5791.48s]  directly next to your body.
[5793.48s -> 5795.48s]  Because he has to be kneeling like that.
[5795.48s -> 5797.48s]  Because he has to be kneeling like that.
[5797.48s -> 5799.48s]  And that's the only time he can be hit.
[5803.98s -> 5805.98s]  But he can hit me once.
[5807.98s -> 5809.98s]  I have to hit him like 20 times.
[5812.47s -> 5814.47s]  Can I put him in a corner?
[5814.47s -> 5818.31s]  No, because he teleports behind me.
[5818.31s -> 5820.31s]  I'm just going to do this and see what happens.
[5820.31s -> 5822.31s]  I'm just going to keep doing this.
[5822.31s -> 5824.31s]  Just do it the exact same way every time.
[5824.31s -> 5826.31s]  Just do it the exact same way every time.
[5834.31s -> 5836.31s]  I'm close.
[5839.13s -> 5841.13s]  But he goes behind you!
[5847.13s -> 5849.13s]  Oh my god.
[5849.13s -> 5851.13s]  Goddamn.
[5856.33s -> 5860.55s]  Do with my eyes closed.
[5860.55s -> 5878.39s]  Okay.
[5878.39s -> 5882.49s]  Why? What?
[5882.49s -> 5885.62s]  Why is it doing that?
[5885.62s -> 5887.62s]  Oh, it's because my webcam's not plugged in.
[5887.62s -> 5889.62s]  So it's taking the last
[5889.62s -> 5896.28s]  frame that it captured.
[5898.71s -> 5903.83s]  Alright, hold on.
[5903.83s -> 5905.83s]  Can I even plug this in? No, I can't.
[5905.83s -> 5909.48s]  Because I have to unplug.
[5909.48s -> 5912.49s]  Do I have too many USBs plugged in?
[5912.49s -> 5914.49s]  Actually, yes, I can.
[5914.49s -> 5917.05s]  I can. I have to unplug my mouse.
[5917.05s -> 5924.78s]  Okay.
[5924.78s -> 5926.78s]  I have too many USBs plugged in and they're all incredibly useful.
[5926.78s -> 5938.34s]  Shit.
[5938.34s -> 5941.80s]  Okay. I just tried to use my mouse.
[5941.80s -> 5956.76s]  That's not going to work. Did it work?
[5956.76s -> 5959.19s]  No, I need my mouse. Hold on.
[5959.19s -> 5965.66s]  I don't have any other emote
[5965.66s -> 5967.66s]  slots. USB
[5967.66s -> 5969.66s]  slots. I don't have
[5969.66s -> 5971.66s]  any other USB slots in my fucking
[5971.66s -> 5973.66s]  whole computer. Yes, I do.
[5973.66s -> 5981.34s]  Why is the Razer app
[5981.34s -> 5983.51s]  opening right now? No, I'm not going
[5983.51s -> 5985.51s]  to install your fucking garbage software.
[5985.51s -> 5994.09s]  Get out of here. Hey!
[5994.09s -> 6001.51s]  Look how red I am now.
[6001.51s -> 6005.86s]  It's the same shirt.
[6005.86s -> 6008.30s]  Yeah, because it's the same day.
[6008.30s -> 6010.30s]  It's the same day.
[6010.30s -> 6012.30s]  It's been like probably an hour
[6012.30s -> 6014.30s]  and 45 minutes since that image was
[6014.30s -> 6019.67s]  captured. Is it desync?
[6019.67s -> 6023.24s]  Oh, kids. Alright.
[6023.24s -> 6025.74s]  I'll turn off the desync. There's no
[6025.74s -> 6030.09s]  desync, you liars. Oh, no, there
[6030.09s -> 6032.84s]  is actually. You guys are not lying.
[6032.84s -> 6037.50s]  Hold on. Sorry to
[6037.50s -> 6039.50s]  really fly off the handle on that one.
[6039.50s -> 6042.06s]  Okay. Now
[6042.06s -> 6045.00s]  I'll do it with my eyes closed.
[6045.00s -> 6047.94s]  This is not going to even work. Why am I doing this?
[6047.94s -> 6058.62s]  Okay, ready?
[6074.92s -> 6077.74s]  Why did I
[6077.74s -> 6079.74s]  just, I heard like five moves.
[6087.74s -> 6089.74s]  Why am I alive?
[6110.33s -> 6113.72s]  I'll sidestep that.
[6113.72s -> 6115.72s]  This is the best way to do this.
[6115.72s -> 6117.72s]  It is.
[6117.72s -> 6119.72s]  It is. Just get away.
[6119.72s -> 6121.72s]  Only attack if you know you have an opening to do this.
[6130.57s -> 6132.57s]  It's getting closer.
[6132.57s -> 6134.57s]  Here it comes.
[6134.57s -> 6136.57s]  Shit. It's okay.
[6136.57s -> 6138.57s]  Run.
[6138.57s -> 6140.57s]  Do it again.
[6140.57s -> 6142.87s]  Run. Do it again.
[6146.01s -> 6148.01s]  Oh! Oh! Oh!
[6148.01s -> 6150.01s]  Don't!
[6150.01s -> 6152.01s]  Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't!
[6152.01s -> 6155.08s]  Run! Run!
[6155.08s -> 6157.08s]  Don't, please.
[6159.90s -> 6165.19s]  His armor's broken.
[6189.59s -> 6193.56s]  I didn't even look at him.
[6196.31s -> 6198.31s]  Oh my god.
[6198.31s -> 6200.31s]  I got it.
[6200.31s -> 6207.40s]  What does he have?
[6207.40s -> 6210.34s]  Ow, my chest.
[6210.34s -> 6212.34s]  What does that mean? I know what it means.
[6212.34s -> 6215.16s]  What does he have? Lego hair?
[6223.80s -> 6230.71s]  That's not it. There's more.
[6230.71s -> 6233.40s]  The other one.
[6233.40s -> 6236.15s]  You have come.
[6236.15s -> 6238.58s]  By orders of Shinto, I have come to kill you.
[6238.58s -> 6243.69s]  Yes.
[6243.69s -> 6245.69s]  It is the mission of your clan.
[6245.69s -> 6247.69s]  To take my life with your Yugiiri.
[6247.69s -> 6249.69s]  To end our existence.
[6254.30s -> 6256.30s]  It was 800 years ago that our ancestors,
[6256.30s -> 6258.30s]  the Kagami family,
[6258.30s -> 6260.30s]  destroyed the Suede family
[6260.30s -> 6267.83s]  and destroyed them.
[6267.83s -> 6269.83s]  There is only one way to have your revenge.
[6269.83s -> 6271.83s]  And lay this feud to rest.
[6273.83s -> 6275.83s]  I don't have to let go here.
[6275.83s -> 6279.22s]  Go ahead.
[6279.22s -> 6281.22s]  Take my life.
[6281.22s -> 6283.22s]  For I am the descendant of the Kagami.
[6283.22s -> 6289.69s]  Do it. Are you going to do it or what are you doing?
[6289.69s -> 6301.59s]  I want to get this right.
[6301.59s -> 6303.59s]  I want like a full on
[6303.59s -> 6305.59s]  baseball swing.
[6310.84s -> 6313.40s]  Wait. Try this way?
[6316.41s -> 6318.41s]  There it is. Alright. Ready? So it's one,
[6318.41s -> 6320.41s]  two, three.
[6320.41s -> 6323.10s]  Just practicing.
[6323.10s -> 6325.10s]  One, two.
[6325.10s -> 6328.49s]  Whatever. What do you mean it's fate?
[6328.49s -> 6330.49s]  This endless, vigilant protection
[6330.49s -> 6332.49s]  so meaningless
[6332.49s -> 6334.49s]  of the blood of the Kagami family.
[6334.49s -> 6337.75s]  It can end now.
[6337.75s -> 6339.75s]  With my death.
[6339.75s -> 6342.44s]  And everything.
[6342.44s -> 6344.44s]  Do you guys really give a shit about
[6344.44s -> 6346.44s]  the bad end of
[6346.44s -> 6348.44s]  Bushido Blade 2?
[6348.44s -> 6355.35s]  The people of Kagami fought for the Kagami family.
[6355.35s -> 6358.36s]  And the people of
[6358.36s -> 6360.36s]  Suei fought for the Suei family.
[6360.36s -> 6362.36s]  You can run out the door.
[6362.36s -> 6364.36s]  I'll do it next time when I do this again.
[6364.36s -> 6366.36s]  Oh wait no I have to fight the teleporting guy again.
[6366.36s -> 6368.36s]  No that's not fun.
[6368.36s -> 6370.36s]  There should be no shame or regret.
[6370.36s -> 6374.84s]  As one of the Kagami family
[6374.84s -> 6376.84s]  was it not your destiny to fight
[6376.84s -> 6379.27s]  until the very end?
[6379.27s -> 6381.27s]  Sword. To fight in order to protect
[6381.27s -> 6383.70s]  something. In the end
[6383.70s -> 6386.20s]  that may have actually saved you.
[6386.20s -> 6390.49s]  How unfortunate.
[6390.49s -> 6392.49s]  Watch the blade.
[6392.49s -> 6394.49s]  You're going to step on a rake and it's going to hit you in the face.
[6394.49s -> 6407.86s]  Alright how do I do
[6407.86s -> 6419.62s]  the assault rifle?
[6419.62s -> 6426.09s]  Battle? How do I
[6426.09s -> 6428.09s]  unlock assault rifle in this game?
[6434.49s -> 6438.52s]  You change the game first.
[6438.52s -> 6440.52s]  No not yet.
[6449.86s -> 6452.55s]  Let's go with
[6452.55s -> 6454.55s]  not broadsword. We did big and slow.
[6454.55s -> 6456.55s]  I want small and usable.
[6456.55s -> 6459.11s]  Not longsword.
[6459.11s -> 6461.35s]  It's an adachi.
[6461.35s -> 6467.30s]  Small streamer.
[6467.30s -> 6472.02s]  Get that person out of here.
[6472.02s -> 6474.52s]  I'm going to do this quick.
[6474.52s -> 6480.66s]  My hair has not moved.
[6480.66s -> 6483.35s]  Alright let me get this done real quick.
[6493.05s -> 6495.05s]  Just wild swings.
[6495.05s -> 6497.42s]  We're just trying to
[6497.42s -> 6499.66s]  die like that one.
[6501.66s -> 6503.66s]  Okay good. Keep going.
[6508.79s -> 6510.79s]  That was a nice counter.
[6510.79s -> 6512.79s]  That was kind of cool but not cool enough.
[6514.79s -> 6516.79s]  Okay.
[6516.79s -> 6518.79s]  That's the hair from the last time his frame
[6518.79s -> 6520.79s]  was captured.
[6520.79s -> 6522.79s]  Alright now you got me looking over at the chat
[6522.79s -> 6524.79s]  room about my
[6524.79s -> 6526.79s]  Lego body. Whatever it is.
[6526.79s -> 6528.79s]  Why do I have two
[6528.79s -> 6530.79s]  headphones in? I don't need them for this game.
[6530.79s -> 6532.79s]  Because I need to be able to hear you guys.
[6539.75s -> 6542.89s]  Get it.
[6542.89s -> 6544.89s]  Bring it over this way.
[6544.89s -> 6546.89s]  Cross.
[6548.89s -> 6550.89s]  Got it.
[6550.89s -> 6578.15s]  This is not accurate.
[6578.15s -> 6580.15s]  This is not accurate.
[6580.15s -> 6647.66s]  Hold on.
[6647.66s -> 6666.41s]  That's fine. God damn it.
[6666.41s -> 6680.81s]  How the fuck would you even know
[6680.81s -> 6682.81s]  what that is? How would you even know?
[6682.81s -> 6701.11s]  It's mirrored so it's hard for me to do this.
[6701.11s -> 6744.50s]  It's exactly the fucking same.
[6744.50s -> 6746.50s]  It looks nice.
[6774.60s -> 6776.60s]  Oh look. He's got the same fucking
[6776.60s -> 6778.60s]  Lego hair.
[6778.60s -> 6780.60s]  Doesn't he? Same hair.
[6783.34s -> 6785.70s]  Oh look at that.
[6807.69s -> 6816.52s]  Yeah fucking guess what?
[6816.52s -> 6818.52s]  Lego hair
[6818.52s -> 6820.52s]  looks pretty damn good.
[6820.52s -> 6822.52s]  It's nice and smooth and
[6822.52s -> 6824.52s]  it's styled. I'm going to kill this guy. How many lands? Watch this.
[6824.52s -> 6826.52s]  One, two, three.
[6826.52s -> 6828.52s]  Lie.
[6828.52s -> 6830.70s]  German lied about Minecraft VR.
[6830.70s -> 6832.70s]  German lied about Minecraft VR.
[6832.70s -> 6834.70s]  Right?
[6834.70s -> 6836.70s]  German's hair looks like
[6836.70s -> 6840.15s]  Minecraft VR.
[6840.15s -> 6847.26s]  Oh!
[6847.26s -> 6852.25s]  He did the thing I wanted to do.
[6858.97s -> 6862.30s]  I'm not even paying attention.
[6862.30s -> 6864.30s]  I'm supposed to be learning combos.
[6866.73s -> 6868.73s]  One, let's see.
[6868.73s -> 6870.73s]  One.
[6870.73s -> 6872.90s]  One.
[6872.90s -> 6874.90s]  One, two.
[6874.90s -> 6877.27s]  One, two.
[6877.27s -> 6879.27s]  There's a two combo.
[6879.27s -> 6882.41s]  I played the first
[6882.41s -> 6884.41s]  game. I already did.
[6884.41s -> 6886.41s]  I already beat the first game. Honorably, by
[6886.41s -> 6888.41s]  the way.
[6898.92s -> 6900.92s]  Alright, I'm just being, I'm running and
[6900.92s -> 6902.92s]  being violent. I need to like
[6902.92s -> 6904.92s]  control my emotions.
[6908.31s -> 6910.31s]  I thought I had it.
[6910.31s -> 6916.84s]  There it is.
[6916.84s -> 6918.84s]  I'm not clicking any world Lego
[6918.84s -> 6920.84s]  links.
[6924.84s -> 6942.17s]  That's not even it.
[6948.17s -> 6950.17s]  Why is there a
[6950.17s -> 6952.17s]  green screened image
[6952.17s -> 6954.17s]  of a balding Lego character template?
[6954.17s -> 6956.17s]  Why?
[6956.17s -> 6958.17s]  What is this for?
[6958.17s -> 6967.06s]  What is the application of this
[6967.06s -> 6969.62s]  image?
[6982.31s -> 6989.16s]  Wait a minute. No, that's just, that's gonna put
[6989.16s -> 6991.85s]  me in there.
[7006.57s -> 7039.10s]  Oh my god, it's trying to key out my green teeth.
[7039.10s -> 7041.10s]  No, it's not. Okay, I thought I had green ass teeth
[7041.10s -> 7043.59s]  right there for a second.
[7043.59s -> 7047.59s]  No, I don't have, look, I don't have green teeth.
[7047.59s -> 7050.28s]  Wait, I'm a new character.
[7052.28s -> 7054.28s]  I don't, I'm done.
[7054.28s -> 7062.14s]  This just looks like my hair's up in a bun.
[7062.14s -> 7068.41s]  Alright, let's see.
[7068.41s -> 7074.04s]  My hair's up in a bun.
[7074.04s -> 7076.04s]  Alright, let's key out
[7076.04s -> 7082.30s]  green.
[7082.30s -> 7087.48s]  That doesn't do anything.
[7087.48s -> 7089.48s]  Okay, I thought I didn't grab it.
[7089.48s -> 7103.29s]  Oh, fuck.
[7103.29s -> 7105.29s]  I actually like this. This is kind of fun.
[7105.29s -> 7107.29s]  The trees come down.
[7110.54s -> 7115.34s]  That's, okay,
[7115.34s -> 7117.34s]  that's very clearly.
[7117.34s -> 7119.34s]  Alright, well to do this correctly,
[7119.34s -> 7121.77s]  give me a second.
[7121.77s -> 7123.77s]  I'm gonna do this correctly.
[7123.77s -> 7130.81s]  Let's see this correctly done.
[7130.81s -> 7141.18s]  It would actually be more like this.
[7141.18s -> 7156.09s]  Because they have these like square heads.
[7156.09s -> 7170.68s]  Not that way.
[7170.68s -> 7182.58s]  Wrong image.
[7182.58s -> 7184.58s]  It looks like I'm wearing a fucking old like 1930s
[7184.58s -> 7187.34s]  football helmet.
[7187.34s -> 7236.92s]  This is not correct. There you go, I'm done.
[7236.92s -> 7241.53s]  Don't say I never did anything for you.
[7241.53s -> 7243.53s]  Oh, do this one too.
[7243.53s -> 7253.51s]  I'm trying to play Bushido Blade 2.
[7253.51s -> 7262.47s]  Fuck this game.
[7262.47s -> 7264.47s]  This is not, is this like, I don't know,
[7264.47s -> 7269.91s]  what is this? Is this supposed to be like a beard?
[7269.91s -> 7275.66s]  No, it's like a, what is this?
[7275.66s -> 7290.62s]  Where's the image?
[7290.62s -> 7292.62s]  There's a bald cap on it.
[7292.62s -> 7305.74s]  Okay, hold on. This is gonna be hard to do
[7305.74s -> 7308.94s]  because of this color. I have to key out this color.
[7308.94s -> 7310.94s]  This is stupid.
[7310.94s -> 7312.94s]  It's not even the same color as my like skin tone.
[7312.94s -> 7321.05s]  Hold on.
[7321.05s -> 7324.70s]  It's closing in on him.
[7324.70s -> 7327.00s]  Alright, I'm gonna add another key.
[7327.00s -> 7332.94s]  Okay.
[7332.94s -> 7335.50s]  And it's gonna be this color. Not green.
[7335.50s -> 7347.13s]  Custom color.
[7347.13s -> 7349.13s]  Okay, it's this.
[7349.13s -> 7351.13s]  Where's my grab, my little grabber thing?
[7351.13s -> 7353.56s]  I need to put it over there on there.
[7353.56s -> 7355.93s]  I don't think I can.
[7355.93s -> 7361.43s]  Hold on, here we go.
[7361.43s -> 7363.43s]  Nope, not that. Wrong one.
[7363.43s -> 7365.43s]  This one? It's like that one.
[7365.43s -> 7372.09s]  Okay, let's see what happens.
[7372.09s -> 7377.45s]  Is that too similar?
[7377.45s -> 7379.45s]  Oh hey, oh well.
[7379.45s -> 7399.93s]  What, somebody made a cutout?
[7399.93s -> 7403.13s]  What's happening right now?
[7403.13s -> 7412.98s]  What is going on?
[7412.98s -> 7414.98s]  I don't have Photoshop open right here.
[7414.98s -> 7416.98s]  I mean, I've got like a stream going.
[7416.98s -> 7418.98s]  I've got stream labs. I've got my game.
[7418.98s -> 7420.98s]  I'm not like, oh let me open up Photoshop.
[7420.98s -> 7422.98s]  Over here.
[7422.98s -> 7424.98s]  That looks like, yeah, let me use the pen tool.
[7424.98s -> 7428.18s]  Open paint?
[7428.18s -> 7430.18s]  I can't open paint. I'm at, I'm 600 milliseconds behind.
[7430.18s -> 7435.56s]  This game sucks.
[7435.56s -> 7437.56s]  I didn't say it.
[7437.56s -> 7439.56s]  In fact, I didn't because this one was, I actually had fun with this one.
[7439.56s -> 7445.06s]  Why is this one all dirty?
[7445.06s -> 7449.80s]  Why?
[7449.80s -> 7464.01s]  This just looks like I'm wearing a hat.
[7464.01s -> 7476.74s]  Okay, I want to change
[7476.74s -> 7482.30s]  wait, color correction.
[7482.30s -> 7514.36s]  It just looks like
[7514.36s -> 7516.36s]  I have a fucking giant white head
[7516.36s -> 7518.36s]  as a fucking skull.
[7518.36s -> 7523.03s]  What if I just like
[7523.03s -> 7527.30s]  Like that, this is not,
[7527.30s -> 7529.30s]  this is just a cyst.
[7529.30s -> 7548.76s]  Good, did everybody get their screenshots?
[7548.76s -> 7556.42s]  Now make an angry face.
[7556.42s -> 7558.42s]  I'm like held hostage right now.
[7558.42s -> 7562.46s]  Okay.
[7562.46s -> 7566.10s]  Okay, okay, alright, alright, alright.
[7566.10s -> 7607.43s]  I'm trying to match this.
[7607.43s -> 7614.34s]  There you go, that's all you're getting. Good night.
[7614.34s -> 7616.65s]  Dr. Phil.
[7616.65s -> 7619.85s]  Dr. Phil.
[7630.07s -> 7634.23s]  I think the game broke.
[7634.23s -> 7636.23s]  What happened?
[7636.23s -> 7638.23s]  Hold on, did I die so many times
[7638.23s -> 7640.23s]  with this character that his plot armor
[7640.23s -> 7642.41s]  melted?
[7642.41s -> 7644.41s]  I died like 15 times.
[7654.42s -> 7658.46s]  Siren, siren, siren.
[7658.46s -> 7660.46s]  Hold on.
[7660.46s -> 7662.46s]  I like this game.
[7662.46s -> 7665.59s]  Alright, you're going to get a choice.
[7665.59s -> 7668.22s]  You're going to get a choice.
[7668.22s -> 7670.78s]  No, you're not. I lied.
[7670.78s -> 7677.37s]  You're not getting a choice.
[7682.50s -> 7684.50s]  Why would I ever play Daze Bomb?
[7684.50s -> 7688.07s]  Because it air shot you.
[7692.68s -> 7696.84s]  Come on, Joe.
[7700.22s -> 7703.29s]  Come on, that was it.
[7703.29s -> 7706.10s]  I don't even know how you got there.
[7714.28s -> 7717.10s]  Okay, that is the run that you do
[7717.10s -> 7722.02s]  when you drop a glass
[7722.02s -> 7724.02s]  and it shatters in the kitchen
[7724.02s -> 7726.02s]  and you don't know what to do. That is the
[7726.02s -> 7728.02s]  I have to go get mom run.
[7733.46s -> 7735.46s]  Another gun.
[7737.46s -> 7743.66s]  Dude, we shot in the air?
[7745.66s -> 7748.65s]  How do you block that? What are you made out of?
[7748.65s -> 7750.65s]  Metal?
[7750.65s -> 7752.89s]  Do you have metal shins?
[7757.75s -> 7765.29s]  Oh shit.
[7765.29s -> 7769.38s]  Sleep well?
[7769.38s -> 7772.20s]  Do you reload?
[7776.34s -> 7780.18s]  What is this
[7780.18s -> 7782.18s]  laugh?
[7784.74s -> 7786.74s]  Why are you doing an Elmer Fudd laugh?
[7786.74s -> 7794.47s]  Reload.
[7799.70s -> 7801.70s]  And you blo- I didn't.
[7816.74s -> 7819.56s]  Dreamcast sucks.
[7819.56s -> 7821.56s]  Laughing by himself.
[7826.04s -> 7832.62s]  Favorite
[7832.62s -> 7834.62s]  chat comment of the last
[7834.62s -> 7836.62s]  three years.
[7839.43s -> 7842.95s]  Come on, climb up. You climb up.
[7842.95s -> 7844.95s]  You climb up because
[7844.95s -> 7846.95s]  you're getting destroyed. I'm going to hit you. I don't even
[7846.95s -> 7849.13s]  care. Fucking honor?
[7849.13s -> 7851.82s]  Nope. Yeah, I'm going to
[7851.82s -> 7853.82s]  cut your damn fingers off.
[7853.82s -> 7870.78s]  Come on, get up here.
[7879.78s -> 7888.49s]  My doctor is going to be so mad
[7888.49s -> 7890.79s]  at me. I keep
[7890.79s -> 7892.79s]  hurting myself.
[7892.79s -> 7906.28s]  Okay.
[7906.28s -> 7908.58s]  Don't
[7908.58s -> 7911.66s]  go that way.
[7911.66s -> 7915.75s]  That's so
[7915.75s -> 7917.75s]  funny.
[7917.75s -> 7921.64s]  What's going on?
[7921.64s -> 7924.01s]  Where am I?
[7924.01s -> 7926.31s]  What am I doing?
[7926.31s -> 7928.55s]  Alright.
[7928.55s -> 7932.58s]  Alright.
[7932.58s -> 7935.14s]  Here comes the
[7935.14s -> 7937.64s]  fall jokes.
[7937.64s -> 7939.64s]  Press R2
[7939.64s -> 7942.01s]  and then hit circle.
[7942.01s -> 7945.46s]  Alright.
[7945.46s -> 7947.46s]  To be fair though, I did not realize
[7947.46s -> 7949.46s]  what was going on until like I was by
[7949.46s -> 7951.46s]  the rock. Could I-
[7951.46s -> 7953.46s]  Okay, once I got to about right here
[7953.46s -> 7955.46s]  I may have been able to stop
[7955.46s -> 7957.46s]  but even if I turned around quickly right here
[7957.46s -> 7959.77s]  I don't think I would have done it.
[7966.07s -> 7968.07s]  Sorry, R2-
[7968.07s -> 7970.07s]  Wait, R2 and then circle?
[7970.07s -> 7973.90s]  Dude, shit.
[7973.90s -> 7975.90s]  You say I throw knives, that's not a knife.
[7975.90s -> 7977.90s]  That's a full sword.
[7981.22s -> 7987.61s]  Alright, give me that back.
[7989.61s -> 7993.05s]  Can I pick it up?
[7993.05s -> 7995.05s]  I don't-
[7995.05s -> 7999.40s]  I can't pick this up.
[7999.40s -> 8004.63s]  Dude, you just die already.
[8006.63s -> 8009.06s]  How does that not kill you?
[8009.06s -> 8011.06s]  Okay.
[8011.06s -> 8015.16s]  There it is.
[8021.75s -> 8023.75s]  Oh, I can't throw it because
[8023.75s -> 8025.75s]  I don't have a hand to throw it with.
[8033.82s -> 8035.82s]  This damn sucks. Flee, shred it.
[8042.60s -> 8045.10s]  Hahaha.
[8045.10s -> 8047.10s]  I win. I'm not gonna shred
[8047.10s -> 8049.98s]  this. You can shred
[8049.98s -> 8051.98s]  the Guy Fieri game because it was $4.
[8051.98s -> 8053.98s]  Bushido Blade 2 was like $30
[8053.98s -> 8056.22s]  or $40.
[8056.22s -> 8058.22s]  This is like a rare game. You don't shred
[8058.22s -> 8077.66s]  this one.
[8077.66s -> 8083.72s]  Back it up. There it is. It's pretty
[8083.72s -> 8085.72s]  incredible.
[8090.39s -> 8092.39s]  Please drop her off the cliff.
[8092.39s -> 8099.75s]  Why do I want that to happen?
[8099.75s -> 8101.75s]  Yeah, I mean, it's a pretty- it's a pretty good image.
[8101.75s -> 8103.75s]  I will tell you. That's a pretty good image.
[8103.75s -> 8108.17s]  What a twist.
[8108.17s -> 8111.43s]  It means you're-
[8111.43s -> 8114.82s]  you're that person's brother.
[8114.82s -> 8116.82s]  That's your- you came from
[8116.82s -> 8118.82s]  the same parents.
[8129.03s -> 8132.94s]  In fact,
[8132.94s -> 8135.24s]  you aren't carrying it at all.
[8135.24s -> 8137.24s]  Seems to be glued
[8137.24s -> 8139.24s]  to the tops of your fingers.
[8139.24s -> 8141.24s]  That wasn't that loud.
[8146.50s -> 8149.32s]  Okay, so
[8149.32s -> 8151.32s]  do I have a choice here?
[8151.32s -> 8153.69s]  Oh, no, I-
[8153.69s -> 8156.76s]  Ooh, I like this.
[8156.76s -> 8159.06s]  Ooh, I like that.
[8159.06s -> 8164.23s]  I like the spin.
[8164.23s -> 8166.23s]  I like that.
[8166.23s -> 8173.77s]  I like that.
[8173.77s -> 8178.17s]  I like that.
[8178.17s -> 8181.18s]  I like that.
[8181.18s -> 8183.18s]  I like that.
[8183.18s -> 8185.42s]  I like the spin.
[8185.42s -> 8187.42s]  Oh, he's dead.
[8187.42s -> 8189.42s]  No, stay away from that character. They're not a longer part of the game.
[8205.27s -> 8207.27s]  And, by the way,
[8207.27s -> 8209.27s]  they died to a default enemy.
[8209.27s -> 8211.96s]  They died to the default
[8211.96s -> 8213.96s]  regular, just enemy.
[8213.96s -> 8219.59s]  That's- that's sad.
[8223.90s -> 8226.33s]  Hey.
[8233.61s -> 8236.54s]  Oh,
[8236.54s -> 8238.54s]  I was trying to bury it in his head.
[8242.54s -> 8244.54s]  There it is.
[8249.53s -> 8251.53s]  Ooh.
[8251.53s -> 8253.53s]  Damn it.
[8253.53s -> 8255.96s]  What the fuck was that?
[8260.68s -> 8264.33s]  Damn it.
[8264.33s -> 8266.82s]  He blocked it twice.
[8266.82s -> 8268.82s]  We cut the shit?
[8268.82s -> 8271.51s]  All right.
[8271.51s -> 8277.27s]  His arm is broken.
[8277.27s -> 8279.27s]  All right, I'm looking over at the chat
[8279.27s -> 8281.27s]  and I see more purple text
[8281.27s -> 8284.28s]  than white text.
[8284.28s -> 8287.42s]  And it also doesn't help that this link
[8287.42s -> 8289.42s]  is like a Google image link
[8289.42s -> 8292.17s]  that's like- what the fuck
[8292.17s -> 8294.60s]  just happened?
[8294.60s -> 8311.88s]  Who shot me with a gun off screen?
[8311.88s -> 8314.12s]  All right, I want to stab. I want to get some of this.
[8314.12s -> 8316.12s]  I mean, that's a pretty cool follow-up,
[8316.12s -> 8318.12s]  but the thing never works.
[8318.12s -> 8326.41s]  Let's go
[8326.41s -> 8328.41s]  back this way.
[8328.41s -> 8330.90s]  Got it.
[8330.90s -> 8332.90s]  It's a virus link. It's a Discord link.
[8341.66s -> 8343.90s]  That's the same thing.
[8343.90s -> 8347.35s]  Oh, that's me from before.
[8347.35s -> 8349.35s]  Now I have to kill me.
[8355.93s -> 8359.64s]  Ooh, this is so dumb.
[8359.64s -> 8361.64s]  What does it even do?
[8363.64s -> 8365.64s]  It just makes me vulnerable to getting hit in the-
[8365.64s -> 8367.64s]  it just makes me vulnerable to getting hit in the face.
[8367.64s -> 8376.47s]  And I didn't get it.
[8378.65s -> 8383.83s]  Same move.
[8383.83s -> 8385.83s]  Same ideas.
[8385.83s -> 8394.90s]  Ooh, that would've been nice.
[8394.90s -> 8396.90s]  So that-
[8404.20s -> 8409.37s]  Shit.
[8409.37s -> 8411.37s]  Joopstorm, attention.
[8411.37s -> 8413.37s]  Joopstorm, chat is bored.
[8413.37s -> 8415.37s]  Joopstorm, attention. Joopstorm, chat is bored.
[8424.14s -> 8427.27s]  What is this?
[8427.27s -> 8429.27s]  What, is this the school bus
[8429.27s -> 8431.83s]  back from the field trip?
[8431.83s -> 8433.83s]  Am I the bus driver?
[8433.83s -> 8436.33s]  Can I look back
[8436.33s -> 8438.33s]  and everyone's just like, Joopstorm,
[8438.33s -> 8440.33s]  Joopstorm, Joopstorm. And I'm like,
[8440.33s -> 8445.51s]  God damn it, kid.
[8445.51s -> 8447.51s]  I'm trying to drive.
[8447.51s -> 8454.62s]  I know- I know
[8454.62s -> 8456.62s]  everybody was really excited
[8456.62s -> 8458.62s]  going to the old English village.
[8458.62s -> 8462.52s]  But relax.
[8465.19s -> 8476.65s]  Was I bleeding on my stomach?
[8485.21s -> 8487.21s]  For a second I thought the audio was off the whole screen.
[8487.21s -> 8494.06s]  Go to the McDonald's
[8494.06s -> 8496.06s]  drive-through
[8496.06s -> 8498.94s]  with a school bus.
[8498.94s -> 8500.94s]  That would be the most fucking
[8500.94s -> 8502.94s]  ridiculous thing.
[8502.94s -> 8504.94s]  Imagine seeing a school bus
[8504.94s -> 8506.94s]  in front of you at the- like the Burger King.
[8506.94s -> 8508.94s]  You'd be like,
[8508.94s -> 8510.94s]  nope, I'm gonna go somewhere
[8510.94s -> 8521.11s]  else.
[8529.24s -> 8531.74s]  Just stop.
[8531.74s -> 8533.74s]  Somebody's like, can we play something else
[8533.74s -> 8535.74s]  besides Bushido
[8535.74s -> 8538.04s]  Butthole 2?
[8538.04s -> 8540.04s]  Excuse me.
[8540.04s -> 8542.04s]  This is a fucking- this is a classic
[8542.04s -> 8544.04s]  game that is very
[8544.04s -> 8546.04s]  very- it paved the way for a lot of stuff.
[8546.04s -> 8548.04s]  And it's fun. I'm playing
[8548.04s -> 8554.12s]  it. What?
[8554.12s -> 8563.40s]  I just did that to him to look cool
[8563.40s -> 8567.69s]  because he looked cool.
[8567.69s -> 8570.70s]  R2 then jump.
[8570.70s -> 8573.83s]  Holy shit, that was cool. What?
[8573.83s -> 8576.71s]  What?
[8576.71s -> 8578.71s]  A sword came out of it.
[8578.71s -> 8580.71s]  Why does a sword
[8580.71s -> 8583.66s]  come out?
[8583.66s -> 8589.22s]  If the game
[8589.22s -> 8591.22s]  is so good, why did they only make two?
[8591.22s -> 8593.22s]  Okay, why did they only make two
[8593.22s -> 8596.87s]  Parappas?
[8596.87s -> 8601.61s]  Why are there only two Paper Marios?
[8601.61s -> 8607.16s]  Why are there
[8607.16s -> 8609.16s]  only two Corona games?
[8609.16s -> 8616.12s]  God damn it, I lost
[8616.12s -> 8618.62s]  again.
[8618.62s -> 8620.62s]  Why are there only two Team Fortresses?
[8620.62s -> 8622.62s]  Why are there only two Half-Lives?
[8627.72s -> 8629.72s]  In fact, if a game has
[8629.72s -> 8631.72s]  more than three or four iterations,
[8631.72s -> 8633.72s]  it's usually a shitty
[8633.72s -> 8635.72s]  game franchise.
[8635.72s -> 8637.72s]  You ever think about that one?
[8637.72s -> 8639.72s]  6,000 IQ chat room?
[8647.14s -> 8653.42s]  Look at that thing.
[8653.42s -> 8655.42s]  That thing's awesome. What's that called?
[8655.42s -> 8658.36s]  That's like the Moonlit Greatsword.
[8658.36s -> 8660.36s]  That thing is so cool. What's that called?
[8666.36s -> 8668.66s]  I ain't gonna let you do that shit.
[8670.66s -> 8674.25s]  That would've been good.
[8674.25s -> 8676.25s]  His arm's fucked up. No.
[8676.25s -> 8678.49s]  I can't believe it.
[8678.49s -> 8684.76s]  It's called Big Sword.
[8684.76s -> 8686.76s]  Guys, I'm only doing this to get to the end
[8686.76s -> 8688.76s]  so I can kill the lady again.
[8688.76s -> 8690.76s]  And everyone can go.
[8690.76s -> 8692.76s]  The D.
[8692.76s -> 8694.76s]  The D face.
[8706.02s -> 8708.02s]  Got it.
[8708.02s -> 8710.02s]  Down. Down.
[8710.02s -> 8712.46s]  Down. Down.
[8714.46s -> 8716.46s]  Oh, the spin.
[8723.80s -> 8726.17s]  Wait.
[8726.17s -> 8729.18s]  Is it teleporting person?
[8729.18s -> 8731.86s]  Uh-oh, it's teleporter.
[8743.58s -> 8745.58s]  Nope.
[8748.14s -> 8750.14s]  Wait, it is.
[8752.14s -> 8755.27s]  Wait, is it?
[8755.27s -> 8757.27s]  Is it new? Is it new guy?
[8757.27s -> 8759.70s]  It is. Thank God.
[8776.58s -> 8784.26s]  Oh, he's got
[8784.26s -> 8786.26s]  an armor gimmick.
[8786.26s -> 8790.09s]  He just bounced
[8790.09s -> 8792.09s]  it off his chest like it was nothing.
[8805.38s -> 8816.46s]  Countering it every time.
[8816.46s -> 8855.80s]  Out of level.
[8875.51s -> 8877.51s]  Fuck.
[8877.51s -> 8879.51s]  I'm trying to hit him in the back.
[8879.51s -> 8883.74s]  Damn it.
[8893.19s -> 8895.19s]  He has like this thing on his back.
[8895.19s -> 8897.19s]  Is that like a spot to hit?
[8905.10s -> 8907.27s]  Okay, I can't hit him.
[8907.27s -> 8910.79s]  He's running after me.
[8910.79s -> 8913.93s]  Burrito? What?
[8918.14s -> 8920.14s]  Strike his back. I'm trying!
[8920.14s -> 8922.31s]  It didn't even get me.
[8922.31s -> 8933.30s]  It didn't work.
[8933.30s -> 8942.70s]  He doesn't know where I am.
[8942.70s -> 8947.30s]  I did it. I got him.
[8947.30s -> 8950.49s]  He was even looking over his
[8950.49s -> 8952.49s]  shoulder like he was backing out of a parking spot.
[8952.49s -> 8954.49s]  Like he was turned looking
[8954.49s -> 8956.49s]  straight back.
[8965.50s -> 8967.50s]  Wait, son?
[8967.50s -> 8969.50s]  Brother? What does that mean?
[8969.50s -> 8982.66s]  I'm your
[8982.66s -> 8984.66s]  father. I'm your
[8984.66s -> 8986.66s]  brother. I'm your sister.
[8986.66s -> 8990.74s]  Sister.
[8990.74s -> 8992.74s]  The most basic of all twists.
[8992.74s -> 8994.74s]  Just three in a row.
[9027.05s -> 9033.06s]  That hasn't been confirmed yet, so you know.
[9042.39s -> 9044.39s]  Okay.
[9044.39s -> 9048.92s]  Okay.
[9048.92s -> 9057.37s]  Guys.
[9057.37s -> 9066.38s]  I have to do it again.
[9066.38s -> 9070.47s]  With another character.
[9070.47s -> 9072.90s]  I have to.
[9072.90s -> 9082.23s]  It's gonna not take-
[9082.23s -> 9084.23s]  I'm gonna do a very good weapon.
[9084.23s -> 9091.53s]  Explain why.
[9091.53s -> 9097.22s]  I don't know.
[9097.22s -> 9104.12s]  I don't know.
[9104.12s -> 9106.12s]  Wait, we didn't even do
[9106.12s -> 9108.12s]  VR mode.
[9108.12s -> 9110.12s]  That's god. We haven't even done VR mode.
[9110.12s -> 9113.38s]  Stop.
[9113.38s -> 9116.84s]  Stop.
[9116.84s -> 9119.34s]  That's enough.
[9119.34s -> 9123.05s]  We've been in the drive-thru for hours.
[9123.05s -> 9136.49s]  Everybody wants me to move to Siren.
[9136.49s -> 9138.49s]  And I can't wait to see
[9138.49s -> 9140.49s]  all the people that say
[9140.49s -> 9142.49s]  go back to Bushido Blade.
[9142.49s -> 9144.86s]  Oh, it's gonna be-
[9144.86s -> 9147.42s]  It's gonna be rich.
[9147.42s -> 9157.21s]  Alright. Just one boss.
[9157.21s -> 9160.66s]  As you.
[9160.66s -> 9162.66s]  And I'm gonna use-
[9162.66s -> 9164.66s]  Hold on. Don't worry. We're almost done.
[9164.66s -> 9166.66s]  We're almost done. Don't worry.
[9166.66s -> 9168.66s]  Broad-sword. We're almost done.
[9168.66s -> 9183.51s]  And then we'll play
[9183.51s -> 9187.54s]  Siren.
[9187.54s -> 9189.78s]  Well, this is awful.
[9189.78s -> 9191.78s]  Why would they put a wireframe here?
[9194.02s -> 9196.02s]  Of all the things that
[9196.02s -> 9198.02s]  don't deserve a punch-out-style
[9198.02s -> 9200.02s]  wireframe.
[9200.02s -> 9202.84s]  It's this game.
[9205.14s -> 9207.14s]  What information
[9207.14s -> 9209.14s]  are they conveying to me?
[9212.84s -> 9215.34s]  I don't know if that's my body,
[9215.34s -> 9217.34s]  my stomach, or-
[9223.35s -> 9233.90s]  Let's go.
[9233.90s -> 9235.90s]  Okay. My final take
[9235.90s -> 9238.07s]  on the Bushido series.
[9238.07s -> 9240.07s]  That's pretty cool. It was great.
[9240.07s -> 9242.94s]  It's a fun game.
[9242.94s -> 9244.94s]  Especially when you play- when you played this game
[9244.94s -> 9246.94s]  in two-player.
[9246.94s -> 9248.94s]  It was really, really, really fun. Because it
[9248.94s -> 9250.94s]  was so easy for someone to die.
[9250.94s -> 9254.12s]  It was great.
