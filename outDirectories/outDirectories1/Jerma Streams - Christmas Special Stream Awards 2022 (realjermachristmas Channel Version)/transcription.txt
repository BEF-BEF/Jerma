[466.87s -> 1454.06s]  Hello! Hi, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Germa 985 Holiday Christmas Special.
[1454.06s -> 1459.06s]  And the award show. I'm Germa, how are you? How's everybody doing?
[1459.06s -> 1465.06s]  Ooh, sorry, it's a little chilly. Oh, it's snowing out there.
[1465.06s -> 1468.30s]  I have a few things to talk about before we get started.
[1468.30s -> 1473.23s]  Thank you for joining me on this beautiful holiday afternoon.
[1473.23s -> 1477.23s]  Over here is a schedule. Everything you need to see today is right here.
[1477.23s -> 1485.23s]  Awards are happening, by the way. Medius categories ever. 27 categories this year.
[1485.23s -> 1488.23s]  There's a lot. I hope you're ready.
[1488.23s -> 1493.23s]  Oh, not only that, we've got also the elf puzzle room. What is the elf puzzle room? Who knows?
[1493.23s -> 1495.23s]  You'll find out very soon.
[1495.23s -> 1498.41s]  Do I see holiday cheer in the chat yet, please?
[1498.41s -> 1501.71s]  There is a schedule, of course there is.
[1501.71s -> 1504.71s]  Can I see some people Christmas, please?
[1504.71s -> 1509.08s]  I need to see it. I'm not going to go any further.
[1509.08s -> 1517.15s]  Okay, so also, Bugleberry is in the building. Can we get some applause for Bugleberry?
[1517.15s -> 1520.78s]  Yes. Thank you, thank you.
[1520.78s -> 1523.78s]  Going to be making a nice, delicious holiday turkey.
[1523.78s -> 1526.78s]  From what I've been told, I don't know. We'll see what he comes up with.
[1526.78s -> 1529.78s]  But also, what's under the tree here?
[1529.78s -> 1534.08s]  I'm going to be opening a lot of these presents. Remember we did that a few years ago?
[1534.08s -> 1536.08s]  They're under here now.
[1536.08s -> 1538.32s]  It's going to be so nice. It's going to be...
[1538.32s -> 1542.32s]  Wait, what's in this one? Hold on.
[1542.32s -> 1544.32s]  I didn't peek, I promise.
[1544.32s -> 1546.32s]  Oh, I think that might be an Xbox.
[1546.32s -> 1550.32s]  It could be an Xbox. I don't know. We'll see, we'll see.
[1550.32s -> 1555.32s]  But anyways, before we get started, how do you do a holiday show?
[1555.32s -> 1561.32s]  Without, of course, an intro. Without a musical intro, perhaps.
[1561.32s -> 1566.32s]  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, round of applause, Top Shelf Vocal.
[1566.32s -> 1573.04s]  Yeah, absolutely. Thank you so much for coming.
[1573.04s -> 1575.04s]  Really appreciate everybody here.
[1575.04s -> 1581.04s]  And from hearing you practice earlier, sounds like you're going to do a little bit of jingle bells, from what I understand.
[1581.04s -> 1583.04s]  Yes, sir.
[1583.04s -> 1588.03s]  And I'll also be joining you as well, as a choir together.
[1588.03s -> 1589.03s]  Are you guys ready?
[1589.03s -> 1590.03s]  Okay.
[1590.03s -> 1591.03s]  Is that okay?
[1591.03s -> 1592.03s]  Of course it is.
[1592.03s -> 1599.92s]  Hey, before we start, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year. Let's get started.
[1599.92s -> 1607.74s]  Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh.
[1607.74s -> 1611.74s]  All the wheels we go, laughing all the way.
[1611.74s -> 1612.74s]  Ha!
[1612.74s -> 2097.53s]  Bells on bobtail.
[2097.53s -> 2101.41s]  Just refresh the screen, then. I don't understand.
[2101.41s -> 2105.42s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[2105.42s -> 2109.42s]  I mean, just refresh. Is the internet problem? We lost the internet. Is that what happened?
[2109.42s -> 2112.74s]  So just get it back.
[2112.74s -> 2115.98s]  Can you connect to another Twitch server?
[2115.98s -> 2122.34s]  There's a guy on the channel right now.
[2122.34s -> 2126.93s]  What do you mean there's a guy on the channel right now? What guy?
[2126.93s -> 2128.93s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[2128.93s -> 2131.93s]  Production in my ear right now. Tell me what's happening. Because I don't understand.
[2131.93s -> 2133.93s]  The stream got hacked?
[2133.93s -> 2135.93s]  My stream got hacked?
[2135.93s -> 2145.38s]  What?
[2145.38s -> 2151.03s]  Should we do a different channel or what? What the fuck is going on?
[2151.03s -> 2158.97s]  Shut the fuck up!
[2158.97s -> 2161.97s]  Don't talk to me. Don't make eye contact with me.
[2161.97s -> 2168.69s]  You know what? Hold on. Show me what's going on.
[2168.69s -> 2170.69s]  What's happening in here?
[2170.69s -> 2172.69s]  Remember, there's a data breach right here.
[2172.69s -> 2176.12s]  Well, someone accessed our stream key.
[2176.12s -> 2179.30s]  How expensive were you two, right?
[2179.30s -> 2182.30s]  I see his name here. This is my channel right here.
[2182.30s -> 2183.30s]  That's right.
[2183.30s -> 2185.30s]  And what happened?
[2185.30s -> 2187.30s]  It looks like there was a breach in the firewall.
[2187.30s -> 2190.30s]  Oh, it looks like there was a breach in the firewall.
[2190.30s -> 2193.30s]  What's your hourly rate, by the way?
[2193.30s -> 2195.30s]  Yeah, don't want to say that, by the way.
[2195.30s -> 2198.30s]  So you both have masters in technology. You can't fucking figure this out?
[2198.30s -> 2200.30s]  Rewrite the source code. Go for it.
[2200.30s -> 2203.30s]  Prescribe that source code over here. What he said.
[2203.30s -> 2207.98s]  Do you understand how much money this cost? Do you understand how much time I spent doing this?
[2207.98s -> 2208.98s]  Yes, sir.
[2208.98s -> 2211.35s]  Where's Offbrand?
[2211.35s -> 2215.35s]  Where the fuck is Ludwig? Where's Atrioc? Where the fuck are they?
[2215.35s -> 2217.91s]  A copy for Mr. Albertson.
[2217.91s -> 2219.91s]  Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
[2219.91s -> 2222.91s]  Hey, buddy. How are you? Fucking snake, motherfucker.
[2222.91s -> 2224.91s]  Who leaked my stream key?
[2224.91s -> 2226.91s]  I don't know. What's going on? What's going on?
[2226.91s -> 2228.91s]  Somebody is live on my channel right now.
[2228.91s -> 2232.91s]  And I'm sorry, but it's making me very upset. And you need to figure out how it happened.
[2232.91s -> 2234.91s]  We'll figure it out. Germo, we'll figure it out.
[2234.91s -> 2238.91s]  If this is a problem, by the way, we are done.
[2238.91s -> 2243.98s]  You and I are never talking ever again. By the way, this was made wrong.
[2243.98s -> 2244.98s]  Germo, dude.
[2244.98s -> 2246.98s]  Don, I don't want to talk to you. Go clean that up.
[2246.98s -> 2259.53s]  Shut up.
[2259.53s -> 2263.53s]  Hey, okay. So what the fuck the heck is going on here?
[2263.53s -> 2267.53s]  Hey, so are we live? Are we live on a different channel?
[2267.53s -> 2269.77s]  Okay. All right.
[2269.77s -> 2273.77s]  So what's happening here is this is the Elf Puzzle Room, by the way.
[2273.77s -> 2275.77s]  Elf Puzzle Room.
[2275.77s -> 2281.63s]  I don't know if we're even live yet. I don't know if we've even started yet.
[2281.63s -> 2283.63s]  But if we can get the energy in the room, we can get higher.
[2283.63s -> 2287.63s]  Yay. So we have a puzzle here that people are going to be doing in this room.
[2287.63s -> 2289.63s]  And it's going to be...
[2289.63s -> 2295.07s]  Stand up.
[2295.07s -> 2298.38s]  Get out. Get out.
[2298.38s -> 2301.64s]  I'm sorry. I don't want to be a dick about this.
[2301.64s -> 2305.64s]  But you were told in the contract when you signed it to shut the fuck up when I came in the room.
[2305.64s -> 2306.64s]  And that's fine.
[2306.64s -> 2309.64s]  So we've got this 10,000-piece puzzle.
[2309.64s -> 2310.64s]  We are actually live. Good.
[2310.64s -> 2314.64s]  So we've got this 10,000-piece puzzle, and it's going to be done over the course of the evening.
[2314.64s -> 2316.64s]  This is awesome. Hooray.
[2316.64s -> 2320.64s]  So you can get started here with this, and you can go for it.
[2320.64s -> 2324.64s]  And hey, don't you think we should have a little bit of snow?
[2324.64s -> 2325.64s]  Yeah.
[2325.64s -> 2328.93s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[2328.93s -> 2330.93s]  All right. So let's get it started here.
[2330.93s -> 2333.93s]  Hey, snow! Snow! Snow! Snow! Snow! Snow! Snow!
[2345.50s -> 2346.80s]  Ow.
[2346.80s -> 2348.80s]  What the fuck did I have, Dad?
[2348.80s -> 2591.82s]  So we confirmed that the other channel, my channel is not working.
[2591.82s -> 2595.15s]  You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[2595.15s -> 2605.26s]  I'm sorry, everybody, that this is happening.
[2605.26s -> 2611.59s]  I just want to say that it's, you know, you've got to do what you've got to do.
[2611.59s -> 2613.59s]  And we're doing this now.
[2613.59s -> 2616.59s]  And it's time for us to just...
[2616.59s -> 2620.59s]  Can somebody please get rid of the ASCII art in the chat that I see over here?
[2620.59s -> 2626.75s]  All I see is ASCII art. I just saw Forsen like a thousand times.
[2626.75s -> 2628.93s]  What do you mean, like, come on, Forsen.
[2628.93s -> 2632.17s]  But there's a lot. We need to clean that up a little, I think.
[2632.17s -> 2636.17s]  While we're here, we're live, we're good, hi, how are you?
[2636.17s -> 2640.17s]  Can we potentially get some people to, say, clap maybe in the back?
[2640.17s -> 2643.17s]  Maybe just pretend like we're doing something good?
[2643.17s -> 2648.67s]  Stop spamming the ASCII art!
[2648.67s -> 2654.69s]  I've got an award show to do.
[2654.69s -> 2660.70s]  Regardless of where we are, regardless of whose channel we're on,
[2660.70s -> 2663.70s]  there, we have awards to do, and we have a lot of them.
[2663.70s -> 2665.70s]  So we have to get started.
[2665.70s -> 2668.19s]  I don't know what's going on over on the other channel.
[2668.19s -> 2670.19s]  I don't know what happened, but we're working on it.
[2670.19s -> 2672.19s]  We've got engineers that are incredibly skilled.
[2672.19s -> 2675.19s]  But we're going to have to do the awards over here.
[2675.19s -> 2680.01s]  So, we'll start. I've got to compose myself a little.
[2680.01s -> 2682.01s]  I've got cocoa over here.
[2682.01s -> 2686.01s]  And it was so freshly brewed and everything just got ruined.
[2686.01s -> 2689.01s]  It's okay. Is it all right?
[2689.01s -> 2692.01s]  Well, what is he even doing on the other channel while we just do this?
[2692.01s -> 2698.98s]  What's he doing on the other channel?
[2698.98s -> 2700.98s]  What is he playing? Is he playing a game?
[2700.98s -> 2704.25s]  Dude, you got no mods.
[2704.25s -> 2706.25s]  Do you think I thought of that?
[2706.25s -> 2708.25s]  Do you think that I thought of that?
[2708.25s -> 2711.25s]  Before the channel got compromised and we're on a different channel.
[2711.25s -> 2714.25s]  Do you think I thought of that? Are you stupid?
[2715.25s -> 2719.58s]  Don't get mad at people in chat. There's no reason to.
[2719.58s -> 2723.58s]  I'm going to do my awards show the way that I'm supposed to.
[2723.58s -> 2725.58s]  27 categories.
[2725.58s -> 2727.94s]  And we're going to get started here.
[2727.94s -> 2729.94s]  So, let's just relax. Can we reset?
[2729.94s -> 2731.94s]  Let's reset.
[2731.94s -> 2737.08s]  The first category is best bro.
[2737.08s -> 2739.08s]  And what is best bro?
[2739.08s -> 2743.08s]  Best bro is when I said, I don't know why this is even a category,
[2743.08s -> 2747.08s]  but it's when I said bro a handful of times.
[2747.08s -> 2750.08s]  So it should be fun to see what those nominees are.
[2750.08s -> 2753.08s]  Here are your nominees for best bro of the year.
[2753.08s -> 2762.66s]  There's one place I didn't go.
[2762.66s -> 2764.66s]  I need to go to the magic school.
[2764.66s -> 2767.16s]  Where's the magic school?
[2767.16s -> 2771.86s]  Bro, where's the magic school?
[2771.86s -> 2772.86s]  No more of this.
[2772.86s -> 2776.86s]  Bro, this is the thing you attached a trailer to a truck.
[2776.86s -> 2780.35s]  That's not a woodcutter.
[2780.35s -> 2782.35s]  What do you mean look at it?
[2782.35s -> 2785.68s]  I'm not looking at it.
[2785.68s -> 2791.92s]  Bro, fellas, ladies and gentlemen, that is not a woodcutter.
[2791.92s -> 2793.92s]  I'm pressing the buttons.
[2793.92s -> 2796.67s]  What the fuck?
[2796.67s -> 2798.67s]  I'm pressing down.
[2798.67s -> 2801.67s]  It just fucking hits a wall and freezes, bro.
[2801.67s -> 2804.94s]  Bro, relax.
[2804.94s -> 2806.94s]  Bro, where am I supposed to put this?
[2806.94s -> 2808.94s]  Why is this even a category by the way?
[2808.94s -> 2811.24s]  Bro.
[2811.24s -> 2813.74s]  This is at the last second.
[2813.74s -> 2817.83s]  What a stupid category.
[2817.83s -> 2819.83s]  Give me a break, man.
[2819.83s -> 2820.83s]  Are you kidding me?
[2820.83s -> 2822.83s]  Melaton is a rhythm game that requires precise timing.
[2822.83s -> 2824.83s]  For a dreamy experience, make sure your sound is on
[2824.83s -> 2829.10s]  and avoid using Bluetooth audio.
[2829.10s -> 2830.66s]  Bro.
[2830.66s -> 2833.94s]  Bro.
[2833.94s -> 2840.11s]  Bro.
[2840.11s -> 2842.11s]  Bro?
[2842.11s -> 2844.11s]  Honestly, man, when somebody asks you,
[2844.11s -> 2848.11s]  when somebody says, hey, dude, do you know there's a dodge in the game?
[2848.11s -> 2850.11s]  Bro.
[2850.11s -> 2852.48s]  Yes.
[2852.48s -> 2858.94s]  Oh.
[2858.94s -> 2860.94s]  You, bro.
[2860.94s -> 2865.10s]  What the fuck?
[2865.10s -> 2866.60s]  Oh.
[2866.60s -> 2870.76s]  Okay, bro.
[2870.76s -> 2872.76s]  What are you fucking doing?
[2872.76s -> 2876.09s]  What the fuck are you talking about, bro?
[2876.09s -> 2878.09s]  I was hitting X on the right spot.
[2878.09s -> 2880.09s]  This is making me really mad.
[2880.09s -> 2884.09s]  Bro, House Flipper is my number one most played game on stream.
[2884.09s -> 2886.09s]  You don't think I know what I'm supposed...
[2886.09s -> 2888.09s]  I'm just trying to do the missions quickly
[2888.09s -> 2890.09s]  to be able to buy the house.
[2890.09s -> 2892.09s]  Bro.
[2892.09s -> 2894.90s]  Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, slow down.
[2894.90s -> 2898.36s]  I just need to hit you with this.
[2898.36s -> 2904.70s]  I got it.
[2904.70s -> 2906.70s]  Somebody in the chat said,
[2906.70s -> 2908.70s]  I just saw it, somebody in the chat said,
[2908.70s -> 2911.70s]  hey, bro, can you play Call of Duty, bro?
[2911.70s -> 2914.46s]  Right now, are you going to say that?
[2914.46s -> 2917.40s]  Right now?
[2917.40s -> 2923.40s]  Anyways, your winner for best bro of the year is...
[2923.40s -> 2929.93s]  Let me get into it.
[2929.93s -> 2931.93s]  I don't even know which one this is.
[2931.93s -> 2936.81s]  Bro, are you kidding me with 26% of the vote?
[2936.81s -> 2941.81s]  And did you know there's a dodge in this game for 24%?
[2941.81s -> 2944.37s]  And then bro, it's not a woodcutter with 13.
[2944.37s -> 2946.37s]  So bro, are you kidding me?
[2946.37s -> 2948.37s]  I don't even know which one that is.
[2948.37s -> 2951.70s]  But there you go, best bro.
[2951.70s -> 2953.70s]  We're going to do another one.
[2953.70s -> 2955.70s]  This is worst beater,
[2955.70s -> 2959.70s]  which also was actually supposed to be taken off the list.
[2959.70s -> 2962.70s]  But I left it on accidentally
[2962.70s -> 2964.70s]  and realized that it was still part of the categories
[2964.70s -> 2966.70s]  before we removed it.
[2966.70s -> 2969.64s]  So we're going to keep it in.
[2969.64s -> 2981.58s]  So let's go ahead and see the nominees for worst beater.
[2981.58s -> 2983.58s]  Over here, here, here.
[2983.58s -> 2989.54s]  Over here, here, here.
[2989.54s -> 2993.50s]  He's doing a joke.
[2993.50s -> 2996.51s]  Beater, beater.
[2996.51s -> 2998.51s]  Beater.
[2998.51s -> 3001.26s]  I love it.
[3001.26s -> 3003.89s]  It was the chap.
[3003.89s -> 3005.89s]  It was the chap took beater.
[3005.89s -> 3007.89s]  We need a wow factor here.
[3007.89s -> 3009.89s]  Okay.
[3009.89s -> 3012.51s]  I'm going to bring it.
[3012.51s -> 3014.51s]  I wanted myself to be a dancer.
[3014.51s -> 3016.51s]  A dancer?
[3016.51s -> 3018.51s]  A dancer, something of a dancer myself.
[3018.51s -> 3021.90s]  That's a beater?
[3021.90s -> 3023.90s]  That is a beater.
[3023.90s -> 3025.90s]  Rats, rats.
[3025.90s -> 3028.34s]  We're the rats.
[3028.34s -> 3032.42s]  Peter.
[3032.42s -> 3034.42s]  It's your birthday today.
[3034.42s -> 3037.36s]  Cake and ice cream is on its way.
[3037.36s -> 3039.86s]  Peter.
[3039.86s -> 3044.22s]  You've been such a good boy this year.
[3044.22s -> 3046.22s]  Stop saying Peter
[3046.22s -> 3048.22s]  and help me with this fucking video game.
[3048.22s -> 3050.22s]  Stop.
[3050.22s -> 3052.22s]  It's half of the chat.
[3052.22s -> 3054.22s]  All I see is butt cracking beater.
[3054.22s -> 3056.22s]  Help me.
[3056.22s -> 3060.19s]  What did he say?
[3060.19s -> 3062.19s]  Wait, what did you say, Peter?
[3062.19s -> 3068.19s]  Peter?
[3068.19s -> 3072.16s]  I'm sorry, that's all I heard.
[3072.16s -> 3074.16s]  Hey, Peter.
[3074.16s -> 3076.16s]  There, old paly.
[3076.16s -> 3078.16s]  It's time for an old fashioned handshake.
[3078.16s -> 3081.28s]  The last supper.
[3081.28s -> 3083.28s]  Yeah, remember when Jesus
[3083.28s -> 3085.28s]  gave a hot tamale to Peter
[3085.28s -> 3087.78s]  and he didn't like it.
[3087.78s -> 3089.78s]  He almost puked.
[3089.78s -> 3091.78s]  Hello again, Peter.
[3091.78s -> 3093.78s]  It's me.
[3093.78s -> 3096.59s]  So.
[3096.59s -> 3099.47s]  I knew we were friends for a reason, Cricket.
[3099.47s -> 3101.47s]  Yeah.
[3101.47s -> 3103.47s]  We do joe.
[3103.47s -> 3105.47s]  We do gourmet.
[3105.47s -> 3107.47s]  We can do just about everything.
[3107.47s -> 3109.47s]  Where the hell is the medicate?
[3109.47s -> 3111.47s]  Are you reading?
[3111.47s -> 3113.47s]  Any amount of voices you can do?
[3113.47s -> 3115.47s]  Worst category of the entire,
[3115.47s -> 3122.45s]  the worst of the entire night.
[3122.45s -> 3124.45s]  I don't know.
[3124.45s -> 3126.45s]  People had to really search for that one.
[3126.45s -> 3128.45s]  There's no way you even knew.
[3128.45s -> 3130.45s]  Maybe some of you saved those clips from earlier.
[3130.45s -> 3132.45s]  But ladies and gentlemen,
[3132.45s -> 3134.45s]  your winner
[3134.45s -> 3136.45s]  for worst beer of the year
[3136.45s -> 3138.45s]  is, I actually don't know this,
[3138.45s -> 3140.45s]  so this is going to be news to me too.
[3140.45s -> 3143.58s]  You've been such a good boy, Peter.
[3143.58s -> 3145.58s]  And then ghost Peter.
[3145.58s -> 3147.89s]  And then infomercial Peter.
[3147.89s -> 3149.89s]  And then infomercial Peter.
[3149.89s -> 3151.89s]  By the way, you've been such a good boy, Peter,
[3151.89s -> 3153.89s]  with 24.7% of the vote.
[3153.89s -> 3155.89s]  So that's cool.
[3155.89s -> 3157.89s]  Very interesting stuff.
[3157.89s -> 3159.89s]  Moving right along.
[3159.89s -> 3162.70s]  Look at this one.
[3162.70s -> 3164.70s]  We're getting through the real shit
[3164.70s -> 3166.70s]  categories first.
[3166.70s -> 3168.70s]  Let me be really clear with you.
[3168.70s -> 3170.70s]  So we're going through the shit categories first.
[3170.70s -> 3172.70s]  As the engineers are still working on the channel.
[3172.70s -> 3175.33s]  Best ooo
[3175.33s -> 3177.33s]  and I'll give one to you right now.
[3177.33s -> 3179.76s]  So here it is.
[3181.76s -> 3183.76s]  I apparently do that quite often.
[3183.76s -> 3185.76s]  I don't know how often because
[3185.76s -> 3187.76s]  why am I opening it now? We haven't even seen the nominees.
[3187.76s -> 3190.70s]  Why would I do that without you seeing
[3190.70s -> 3193.33s]  the nominees first?
[3193.33s -> 3195.33s]  Anyways, here are your nominees for
[3195.33s -> 3197.33s]  worst, no, it's best ooo
[3197.33s -> 3199.33s]  of the year.
[3199.33s -> 3208.91s]  That was a good one too.
[3208.91s -> 3214.40s]  Oh,
[3214.40s -> 3216.90s]  oh,
[3216.90s -> 3220.03s]  hmm.
[3220.03s -> 3222.59s]  Is that a mask?
[3222.59s -> 3225.28s]  Or does he actually have two heads?
[3225.28s -> 3227.28s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh,
[3227.28s -> 3229.28s]  oh, oh, oh, oh,
[3229.28s -> 3231.28s]  oh, oh, oh, we got it.
[3231.28s -> 3233.28s]  All right. Hello.
[3233.28s -> 3235.71s]  I'm here. I'm here
[3235.71s -> 3237.71s]  to get a rust repair kit.
[3237.71s -> 3240.85s]  Oh, oh,
[3240.85s -> 3247.94s]  oh, oh,
[3247.94s -> 3251.14s]  oh, oh,
[3251.14s -> 3255.68s]  oh,
[3255.68s -> 3258.88s]  oh,
[3258.88s -> 3260.88s]  can I stand actually for a spell
[3260.88s -> 3262.88s]  because if it is, I want to know what it is.
[3262.88s -> 3266.66s]  Mud, oh,
[3266.66s -> 3268.66s]  oh,
[3268.66s -> 3270.66s]  I like this game. This is a fun game.
[3270.66s -> 3277.76s]  Oh,
[3277.76s -> 3279.76s]  oh,
[3279.76s -> 3282.32s]  oh, I didn't even need to, whatever.
[3282.32s -> 3284.88s]  Oh,
[3284.88s -> 3289.04s]  oh, get ready to nominate
[3289.04s -> 3297.04s]  that one. So all bad.
[3297.04s -> 3301.14s]  You know, before I
[3301.14s -> 3303.44s]  open this, I want to say I didn't
[3303.44s -> 3305.44s]  think that there was even enough to
[3305.44s -> 3307.44s]  vote for this year. I think I said
[3307.44s -> 3309.44s]  that a few weeks ago.
[3309.44s -> 3311.44s]  I was like, there's no way that I did this
[3311.44s -> 3313.44s]  this many times, but apparently I did
[3313.44s -> 3315.87s]  it a thousand times.
[3315.87s -> 3317.87s]  We'll see who wins. Ladies and gentlemen, your winner
[3317.87s -> 3319.87s]  for worst ooh ooh ooh
[3319.87s -> 3321.87s]  of the year is
[3321.87s -> 3325.33s]  with
[3325.33s -> 3327.33s]  35.8 percent of the vote.
[3327.33s -> 3329.33s]  We got it from
[3329.33s -> 3331.33s]  Sorcery. And then
[3331.33s -> 3333.33s]  get ready to nominate this one for 23 percent
[3333.33s -> 3335.33s]  and then Sorcery spell excitement.
[3335.33s -> 3337.33s]  I mean, I said it
[3337.33s -> 3339.33s]  like five times in a row. It was like,
[3339.33s -> 3341.33s]  ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[3341.33s -> 3343.33s]  If you don't, by the way, there's probably people that have no idea what the hell that is.
[3343.33s -> 3345.33s]  So that is a
[3345.33s -> 3347.33s]  sound effect file from the
[3347.33s -> 3349.33s]  Simpsons arcade game. The first
[3349.33s -> 3351.33s]  boss of the game does that every time you hit him three or four
[3351.33s -> 3353.33s]  times. So if you, understanding
[3353.33s -> 3355.33s]  what that actually is from, it's
[3355.33s -> 3357.33s]  from that game.
[3357.33s -> 3359.63s]  And by the way,
[3359.63s -> 3361.63s]  speaking of shit categories,
[3361.63s -> 3363.63s]  by the way, I did talk to production
[3363.63s -> 3365.63s]  earlier about, man, this category
[3365.63s -> 3367.63s]  takes way too long. This is going to take
[3367.63s -> 3369.63s]  far too long. I don't even want to, I was
[3369.63s -> 3371.63s]  going to remove it last second.
[3371.63s -> 3373.63s]  I was going to say, let's not do it
[3373.63s -> 3375.63s]  because it's worst cat puke.
[3375.63s -> 3377.63s]  There's like 40, there's like 20 or 30
[3377.63s -> 3379.63s]  nominees. It's like an eight
[3379.63s -> 3381.63s]  minute video. So are you ready to watch eight
[3381.63s -> 3383.63s]  minutes or so? Is everybody cat puking?
[3387.07s -> 3389.07s]  Alright, I guess so.
[3389.07s -> 3392.34s]  There are no mods.
[3392.34s -> 3394.90s]  There are mods.
[3394.90s -> 3396.90s]  We modded random fucking people.
[3396.90s -> 3398.90s]  So people say this
[3398.90s -> 3400.90s]  is the best category. We'll find out.
[3400.90s -> 3402.90s]  Ladies and gentlemen, here are your
[3402.90s -> 3404.90s]  nominees for worst cat
[3404.90s -> 3413.66s]  puke of the year.
[3428.42s -> 3430.42s]  And then I move away
[3430.42s -> 3432.42s]  that they don't like.
[3432.42s -> 3437.47s]  And I start to
[3437.47s -> 3439.47s]  fucking pass out and shit. Like, I don't know, they
[3439.47s -> 3441.47s]  freak me out. That would be so scary.
[3441.47s -> 3444.67s]  If you're just in like a pitch
[3444.67s -> 3447.23s]  black area
[3447.23s -> 3452.61s]  and all you hear is this.
[3452.61s -> 3457.22s]  Oh, what?
[3457.22s -> 3459.22s]  Let me try that brew.
[3459.22s -> 3461.97s]  You can just
[3461.97s -> 3464.14s]  hear the crunch of
[3464.14s -> 3467.92s]  the bread.
[3467.92s -> 3469.92s]  Do you need a handsaw to cut through a piece of
[3469.92s -> 3474.85s]  fucking bread?
[3474.85s -> 3476.85s]  We're going to narrow this down to three.
[3476.85s -> 3478.85s]  To be clear, you can't decide 15
[3478.85s -> 3480.85s]  wins.
[3480.85s -> 3482.85s]  The penultimate round is here. Let's see
[3482.85s -> 3484.85s]  god damn things.
[3484.85s -> 3489.26s]  Oh,
[3489.26s -> 3495.34s]  nice. Holy shit, I was on camera. You got
[3495.34s -> 3497.34s]  to see what it looked like. I mean, you don't
[3497.34s -> 3499.34s]  you know, I'm not talking about like you like
[3499.34s -> 3501.34s]  no, you
[3501.34s -> 3503.34s]  pick it up and you like
[3503.34s -> 3505.34s]  fold it up and
[3505.34s -> 3511.30s]  you eat it.
[3511.30s -> 3513.30s]  I don't know. That was fucked up. I was having problems.
[3513.30s -> 3515.30s]  My internet's fine.
[3515.30s -> 3518.37s]  It must be maintenance.
[3520.37s -> 3522.61s]  Natural peanut butter with the oil
[3522.61s -> 3524.61s]  that settles and you have to
[3524.61s -> 3526.61s]  mix it up a little bit or I'm
[3526.61s -> 3528.61s]  telling you, man, sometimes I just scoop in there and I get
[3528.61s -> 3530.61s]  a bunch of the top layer oil and a little bit
[3530.61s -> 3532.61s]  of the top layer of peanut butter.
[3532.61s -> 3534.61s]  I eat it. It's delicious.
[3534.61s -> 3536.61s]  You're drinking the oil. I'm not
[3536.61s -> 3538.61s]  I don't
[3538.61s -> 3540.61s]  tip it up and like
[3540.61s -> 3542.61s]  no, I'm talking to you. It's like a little
[3542.61s -> 3544.61s]  test. It's a little tasting like
[3544.61s -> 3546.61s]  that's it, man.
[3546.61s -> 3552.88s]  I need the inspiration.
[3552.88s -> 3555.31s]  What's the point of this?
[3555.31s -> 3559.28s]  Oh, thank god.
[3569.71s -> 3574.90s]  There's too many of these.
[3574.90s -> 3576.90s]  Way too many of these.
[3576.90s -> 3578.90s]  I can eyeball that. I'm really good
[3578.90s -> 3580.90s]  with that.
[3580.90s -> 3582.90s]  Sorry.
[3582.90s -> 3584.90s]  Pumpkins just broke me.
[3584.90s -> 3598.83s]  Cappies.
[3598.83s -> 3600.83s]  There are way too many of those.
[3600.83s -> 3603.01s]  I lost count. How many were
[3603.01s -> 3605.01s]  there actually? How many nominees were there?
[3605.01s -> 3610.83s]  Twenty?
[3610.83s -> 3612.83s]  Why would I?
[3612.83s -> 3614.83s]  Alright, that's never coming back.
[3614.83s -> 3616.83s]  Here you go. Here's the last time you'll ever hear
[3616.83s -> 3623.62s]  that sound. It's very cold.
[3623.62s -> 3626.50s]  It's supposed to be hot cocoa
[3626.50s -> 3628.80s]  in my hot cocoa poetry power.
[3628.80s -> 3630.80s]  Okay, so the winner, who cares?
[3630.80s -> 3632.80s]  Does anybody give a shit about this?
[3632.80s -> 3634.80s]  Who actually cares? Pre-recorded
[3634.80s -> 3637.74s]  Andy.
[3637.74s -> 3641.33s]  What do you say?
[3643.70s -> 3645.70s]  There are 27 categories.
[3645.70s -> 3651.39s]  Ladies and gentlemen, your winner
[3651.39s -> 3653.76s]  for worst cat puke
[3653.76s -> 3656.00s]  is...
[3656.00s -> 3659.46s]  What do you think? Actual cat puke
[3659.46s -> 3661.46s]  at 14.4%.
[3661.46s -> 3663.46s]  I probably saw that one coming.
[3663.46s -> 3665.46s]  Pitch black
[3665.46s -> 3667.46s]  cat puke at 14.
[3667.46s -> 3669.46s]  It was very close.
[3669.46s -> 3671.46s]  And then eating eggs
[3671.46s -> 3673.46s]  with 9.8%. By the way,
[3673.46s -> 3675.46s]  I think two or three years running now,
[3675.46s -> 3677.46s]  this is the most skipped category.
[3677.46s -> 3679.46s]  Almost 20% of you
[3679.46s -> 3681.46s]  that took this poll just skipped it.
[3681.46s -> 3685.81s]  What's going on?
[3685.81s -> 3690.08s]  What's that? The hacker is ahead
[3690.08s -> 3692.08s]  of you. I don't understand what that
[3692.08s -> 3696.56s]  means. What's going on back
[3696.56s -> 3700.72s]  here? Why is that happening?
[3700.72s -> 3702.72s]  Can you put it back to the snow? I want people to think
[3702.72s -> 3704.72s]  I'm in an actual place with snow.
[3704.72s -> 3709.71s]  Hold on. Hey, hey, hey!
[3709.71s -> 3712.58s]  You too.
[3712.58s -> 3714.58s]  What's going on with my backdrop?
[3714.58s -> 3716.58s]  Your backdrop
[3716.58s -> 3718.58s]  is supposed to be snow, and there's like
[3718.58s -> 3720.58s]  meme shit on it.
[3720.58s -> 3722.82s]  Are you going to try something?
[3722.82s -> 3726.34s]  This usually works. Well, whatever it is,
[3726.34s -> 3728.83s]  it didn't work. You know what?
[3728.83s -> 3730.83s]  Why don't we mess with him back?
[3730.83s -> 3733.07s]  Why don't we send something that's really going to mess this stuff up?
[3733.07s -> 3735.07s]  Hello!
[3735.07s -> 3737.07s]  Stop talking!
[3737.07s -> 3739.07s]  Who the fuck are you? Who am I? Who are you?
[3739.07s -> 3741.07s]  What are you doing on my stream?
[3741.07s -> 3743.07s]  What do you mean, your stream?
[3743.07s -> 3745.07s]  This is my Christmas special. What are you doing here?
[3745.07s -> 3747.07s]  Is this the guy? Is this the fucking guy
[3747.07s -> 3749.07s]  right here?
[3749.07s -> 3751.07s]  Hey, bro! What's up?
[3751.07s -> 3753.07s]  Hey, bro!
[3753.07s -> 3755.07s]  Did you just hack it?
[3755.07s -> 3757.07s]  Oh, he's a hacker! Wow!
[3757.07s -> 3759.07s]  He's so skilled. He's so
[3759.07s -> 3761.07s]  talented. It's the extinguisher.
[3761.07s -> 3763.07s]  Wait, what?
[3763.07s -> 3765.07s]  You will call me by my name.
[3765.07s -> 3767.07s]  The extinguisher.
[3767.07s -> 3769.07s]  Your name is the extinguisher?
[3769.07s -> 3771.07s]  That's right.
[3771.07s -> 3773.07s]  Did you get that name from like the fifth grade?
[3773.07s -> 3775.07s]  What a terrible name.
[3775.07s -> 3777.07s]  It was sixth grade.
[3777.07s -> 3779.07s]  The extinguisher. Okay, extinguisher.
[3779.07s -> 3781.07s]  How are you? How are things?
[3781.07s -> 3783.07s]  Why? What are you doing?
[3783.07s -> 3785.07s]  What is your goal here?
[3785.07s -> 3787.07s]  Oh, my goal?
[3787.07s -> 3789.07s]  My goal is to get you to apologize for all the things
[3789.07s -> 3791.07s]  you haven't accomplished.
[3791.07s -> 3793.07s]  I've accomplished tons of stuff. We've got Dollhouse.
[3793.07s -> 3795.07s]  What about the hundred gifted subs?
[3797.31s -> 3799.31s]  Hundred gifted subs.
[3799.31s -> 3801.31s]  What do you mean?
[3801.31s -> 3803.31s]  What about you not playing Yakuza?
[3803.31s -> 3805.31s]  I thought you were going to play that one.
[3805.31s -> 3807.31s]  Yeah, I'm going to.
[3807.31s -> 3809.31s]  I didn't play Yakuza. That's why you hacked the stream.
[3809.31s -> 3811.31s]  At two billion dollars of debt,
[3811.31s -> 3813.31s]  what are you? The government?
[3813.31s -> 3815.31s]  That's, all right. Well, first of all,
[3815.31s -> 3817.31s]  there's a couple things. Let me rebuttal.
[3817.31s -> 3819.31s]  After I rebuttal, maybe you'll give the channel back.
[3819.31s -> 3821.31s]  Maybe when you play Glover,
[3821.31s -> 3823.31s]  I'll give the channel back.
[3823.31s -> 3825.31s]  I played Glover! That game sucked!
[3825.31s -> 3827.31s]  What do you mean, play Glover? Is that what you're really on about here?
[3827.31s -> 3829.31s]  And the chat loves it.
[3829.31s -> 3831.31s]  All right. Well, I kind of don't give a shit
[3831.31s -> 3833.31s]  about anything that you're saying right now,
[3833.31s -> 3835.31s]  because number one, I did try
[3835.31s -> 3837.31s]  to give the community subs a hundred.
[3837.31s -> 3839.31s]  My credit card got declined like five times.
[3839.31s -> 3841.31s]  I did try. My credit card got declined like five times.
[3841.31s -> 3843.31s]  That's literally what you sound like.
[3843.31s -> 3845.31s]  Did you get his fucking area yet?
[3847.49s -> 3849.49s]  You're never going to find me, Jerma.
[3849.49s -> 3851.49s]  So what the hell?
[3851.49s -> 3853.49s]  You just come in to taunt us? Is that what you're doing?
[3853.49s -> 3855.79s]  Is that the fun you're going to have here?
[3855.79s -> 3857.79s]  What are you doing? Yeah, that's why I'm here.
[3857.79s -> 3859.79s]  Thank you. And I'm here to
[3859.79s -> 3861.79s]  give the people what they want.
[3861.79s -> 3863.79s]  Yeah. And what is that again?
[3863.79s -> 3865.79s]  You're just hacking the channel? That's funny.
[3865.79s -> 3867.79s]  That's funny. Everyone's laughing about it.
[3867.79s -> 3869.79s]  I'm sure it's fun. Look at them.
[3869.79s -> 3871.79s]  Look at them in the chat. Okay, well, thank you.
[3871.79s -> 3873.79s]  I appreciate hearing from you. Now, can you please leave me alone?
[3873.79s -> 3875.79s]  Should I have to do? Leave me the fuck alone.
[3875.79s -> 3877.79s]  Wow. No?
[3877.79s -> 3880.54s]  Yeah, great respond.
[3880.54s -> 3882.54s]  No. That's the answer?
[3882.54s -> 3884.54s]  No. Okay.
[3884.54s -> 3886.54s]  Well, you know what?
[3886.54s -> 3888.54s]  What do you got? What do you got?
[3888.54s -> 3890.54s]  Why don't we send him something fucked up?
[3890.54s -> 3892.54s]  How does that sound? Do you guys have a connection?
[3892.54s -> 3894.54s]  Do you have a connection? What if I do this?
[3894.54s -> 3896.54s]  Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean? What?
[3896.54s -> 3898.54s]  What if I do this? Huh? Stop doing that.
[3898.54s -> 3900.91s]  Ah. That's funny.
[3900.91s -> 3902.91s]  That's so fun, is it? That is great.
[3902.91s -> 3904.91s]  I saw the IP address. Was that an IP?
[3904.91s -> 3906.91s]  Yeah, try that on for size.
[3906.91s -> 3908.91s]  Get that shit off.
[3908.91s -> 3910.91s]  Look at your face. It's so angry.
[3910.91s -> 3912.91s]  You're such an asshole.
[3912.91s -> 3914.91s]  You have a connection, right? Send something back.
[3914.91s -> 3916.91s]  Go ahead. Send something back, guys.
[3916.91s -> 3918.91s]  Eat shit, you hacker!
[3918.91s -> 3920.91s]  It's the extinguisher.
[3920.91s -> 3922.91s]  You will learn my name by the end of the stream.
[3924.91s -> 3926.91s]  Follow me, old chum.
[3926.91s -> 3928.91s]  I'm not a gnome.
[3928.91s -> 3930.91s]  I'm not a gnoblin.
[3930.91s -> 3932.91s]  Did you do that? Yeah.
[3932.91s -> 3934.91s]  I'm a gnome. What year is it?
[3934.91s -> 3936.91s]  Can you be gnome?
[3936.91s -> 3938.91s]  I want to tell me what year it is.
[3938.91s -> 3940.91s]  You're gonna gnome the guy?
[3940.91s -> 3942.91s]  That's so fucking stupid.
[3942.91s -> 3944.91s]  You're gonna gnome me on a live stream
[3944.91s -> 3946.91s]  with over 20,000 people?
[3946.91s -> 3948.91s]  That's so 2017.
[3948.91s -> 3950.91s]  I don't...
[3950.91s -> 3952.91s]  Why would you gnome somebody?
[3952.91s -> 3954.91s]  That's all you can do back...
[3954.91s -> 3957.15s]  Get his
[3957.15s -> 3959.15s]  location and send
[3959.15s -> 3961.15s]  something else. Get us back
[3961.15s -> 3963.15s]  access for the love of God.
[3963.15s -> 3966.10s]  Give me a fucking break, dude.
[3966.10s -> 3969.04s]  You send a gnome
[3969.04s -> 3971.04s]  over there. You know how bad that
[3971.04s -> 3974.37s]  makes me look? We got
[3974.37s -> 3976.37s]  CatboyGerma. We got the Suski.
[3976.37s -> 3978.37s]  He even turned off...
[3978.37s -> 3980.37s]  We can't even turn this back to normal.
[3980.37s -> 3982.54s]  What a disaster.
[3982.54s -> 3984.54s]  Anyways,
[3984.54s -> 3986.54s]  I may have made a few of these,
[3986.54s -> 3989.10s]  but...
[3989.10s -> 3992.18s]  You know, let's just get right into it.
[3992.18s -> 3994.18s]  Everybody's waiting for this category,
[3994.18s -> 3996.18s]  and it's a good one, so let's take our time with it.
[3996.18s -> 3998.18s]  Ladies and gentlemen, here are the nominees
[3998.18s -> 4000.18s]  for worst face
[4000.18s -> 4002.18s]  of the year.
[4002.18s -> 4006.02s]  Fucking gnome the guy.
[4006.02s -> 4014.46s]  Unbelievable.
[4014.46s -> 4017.09s]  Now listen here, Batman.
[4017.09s -> 4019.09s]  I think that's what's gonna happen.
[4019.09s -> 4024.72s]  Turn the webcam on.
[4024.72s -> 4040.21s]  I can see the music!
[4040.21s -> 4043.66s]  That was such an ugly face. I hate that one.
[4043.66s -> 4046.10s]  You look very handsome today.
[4046.10s -> 4049.81s]  Thanks.
[4049.81s -> 4058.51s]  This is bullshit again.
[4058.51s -> 4062.03s]  He didn't do that before!
[4062.03s -> 4066.70s]  Don't go
[4066.70s -> 4068.70s]  4-2 back,
[4068.70s -> 4070.70s]  because you're flipping spawns.
[4070.70s -> 4072.70s]  Yeah.
[4072.70s -> 4074.70s]  Just contain mid control, and just hold them out and spawn.
[4074.70s -> 4076.70s]  We should be fine.
[4084.90s -> 4089.50s]  Wow!
[4097.82s -> 4099.82s]  That wasn't even a real fight.
[4099.82s -> 4101.82s]  You can see every inch of my face, too.
[4101.82s -> 4103.82s]  I don't like this.
[4103.82s -> 4106.00s]  I hate this.
[4106.00s -> 4108.43s]  Oh!
[4108.43s -> 4110.43s]  Holy shit, people are so ugly with light, aren't they?
[4112.43s -> 4114.67s]  See? This is me.
[4114.67s -> 4117.49s]  This is my face.
[4135.98s -> 4137.98s]  Do you honestly think I don't know the horse has a dodge
[4137.98s -> 4140.54s]  65 hours into the game?
[4140.54s -> 4150.14s]  I thought she was doing another move.
[4150.14s -> 4152.14s]  I thought that was the big sweeping one.
[4152.14s -> 4154.14s]  Oh my god.
[4154.14s -> 4156.14s]  Fuck this fight.
[4156.14s -> 4158.14s]  Fuck this game. Return it.
[4158.14s -> 4160.14s]  I don't have 100 hours in it, but I'm returning it.
[4160.14s -> 4162.14s]  I'm going up to the counter with these eyes like this.
[4162.14s -> 4164.14s]  The fucking GameStop that I got this piece of shit from.
[4164.14s -> 4166.14s]  They're gonna be like,
[4166.14s -> 4168.14s]  Hey, I would like to make a return, please.
[4170.77s -> 4172.77s]  More games for your wax face.
[4176.40s -> 4185.10s]  Find me a path I can go.
[4185.10s -> 4187.10s]  Find me one path.
[4187.10s -> 4203.28s]  That was weird.
[4207.28s -> 4209.28s]  Abbott's a holy man.
[4209.28s -> 4211.28s]  Okay.
[4215.28s -> 4217.28s]  I wonder where I go from here, though.
[4217.28s -> 4219.28s]  If I had to keep it all in,
[4219.28s -> 4221.28s]  After like an hour, I'd be like this.
[4221.28s -> 4223.28s]  It would be insane.
[4223.28s -> 4227.38s]  I would explode.
[4227.38s -> 4230.45s]  Okay.
[4230.45s -> 4240.11s]  Put that in here.
[4240.11s -> 4245.87s]  I'm just going up the stairs.
[4245.87s -> 4251.44s]  I don't give a shit if he hears me.
[4251.44s -> 4255.41s]  I thought he was downstairs.
[4258.29s -> 4270.69s]  In a circle.
[4270.69s -> 4274.53s]  That was the chicken.
[4274.53s -> 4276.53s]  That was the fucking rooster.
[4276.53s -> 4278.53s]  That was a rooster.
[4278.53s -> 4280.53s]  That was actually a rooster.
[4280.53s -> 4282.53s]  Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[4282.53s -> 4296.86s]  Fuck you.
[4296.86s -> 4300.77s]  Come on.
[4300.77s -> 4302.77s]  Is there an O-Rick?
[4302.77s -> 4306.22s]  Was that an O-Rick
[4306.22s -> 4308.22s]  at the end? What was that?
[4308.22s -> 4312.64s]  O-Rick.
[4312.64s -> 4314.64s]  Yeah, I have a tendency to make faces.
[4314.64s -> 4316.64s]  But, you know,
[4316.64s -> 4318.64s]  whatever. It is what it is.
[4318.64s -> 4320.64s]  This is going to be news
[4320.64s -> 4322.64s]  to me because we don't know.
[4322.64s -> 4324.88s]  Ladies and gentlemen, the winner
[4324.88s -> 4326.88s]  of the worst face of the
[4326.88s -> 4328.88s]  year. It was pretty close.
[4328.88s -> 4331.70s]  You look very handsome
[4331.70s -> 4333.70s]  today. At 16.8%
[4333.70s -> 4335.70s]  of the vote.
[4335.70s -> 4337.70s]  Germa cheesed is a little bit further after that
[4337.70s -> 4339.70s]  at 11.4%.
[4339.70s -> 4341.70s]  And then smushed sleeping face.
[4341.70s -> 4343.70s]  Which, if you had asked me, I thought
[4343.70s -> 4345.94s]  would have been number one.
[4345.94s -> 4347.94s]  So you look very handsome today.
[4347.94s -> 4349.94s]  This one.
[4349.94s -> 4351.94s]  That one there. I do that apparently frequently.
[4351.94s -> 4353.94s]  But, yeah.
[4353.94s -> 4359.18s]  You look very handsome today.
[4359.18s -> 4361.18s]  It's this one.
[4361.18s -> 4363.18s]  That's fine.
[4363.18s -> 4365.18s]  You can't nominate this stream
[4365.18s -> 4367.18s]  because it's literally
[4367.18s -> 4369.18s]  the day we're doing this.
[4369.18s -> 4371.18s]  We're going to do best accident now.
[4371.18s -> 4373.49s]  Rick!
[4373.49s -> 4376.24s]  Best accident is when something goes
[4376.24s -> 4378.24s]  wrong during a stream
[4378.24s -> 4380.24s]  and we need to figure out how
[4380.24s -> 4382.24s]  to fix it. So that's where we
[4382.24s -> 4384.24s]  are now. This is
[4384.24s -> 4386.24s]  the sixth category. Still plenty.
[4386.24s -> 4388.24s]  Still plenty to do today.
[4388.24s -> 4390.24s]  So, ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees
[4390.24s -> 4392.24s]  for best accident of the year.
[4392.24s -> 4401.58s]  Blue Bunny
[4401.58s -> 4403.58s]  makes the best grocery store ice cream.
[4403.58s -> 4405.58s]  Without a doubt. It's by a mile.
[4405.58s -> 4409.68s]  Here. Blue Bunny.
[4409.68s -> 4412.05s]  Chocolate. Chocolate ice cream. It's fluffy.
[4412.05s -> 4425.36s]  It's pillowy.
[4440.21s -> 4443.73s]  Don't do it down there.
[4443.73s -> 4445.73s]  Don't do it down there. Don't do it down here.
[4445.73s -> 4447.73s]  Don't do that down here.
[4447.73s -> 4449.97s]  You do not want this
[4449.97s -> 4451.97s]  down here.
[4451.97s -> 4453.97s]  It's time to fight some crime.
[4453.97s -> 4457.10s]  Made some adjustments to my suit.
[4457.10s -> 4460.05s]  I feel like it's a little more appropriate.
[4460.05s -> 4465.10s]  Let's go.
[4465.10s -> 4473.87s]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[4473.87s -> 4478.54s]  What are you?
[4478.54s -> 4483.46s]  Those!
[4483.46s -> 4486.08s]  No, I'm doing the thing. I'm doing the thing that
[4486.08s -> 4488.08s]  fucking meme.
[4488.08s -> 4490.08s]  I'm not grunting.
[4490.08s -> 4492.08s]  What sex noises are you talking about?
[4492.08s -> 4494.08s]  I've been silent the whole time.
[4494.08s -> 4500.48s]  I've been silent the whole time.
[4500.48s -> 4502.72s]  What are you talking about?
[4502.72s -> 4515.52s]  I've been silent the whole time.
[4515.52s -> 4517.52s]  What?
[4517.52s -> 4521.04s]  What the fuck?
[4521.04s -> 4527.87s]  Security camera.
[4527.87s -> 4535.74s]  What the fuck?
[4535.74s -> 4537.74s]  Why is it going so high?
[4537.74s -> 4539.74s]  Here's your glove.
[4539.74s -> 4542.88s]  It fits perfectly.
[4542.88s -> 4545.18s]  As you see.
[4545.18s -> 4547.18s]  It fits perfectly.
[4547.18s -> 4549.18s]  I promise. I promise I didn't
[4549.18s -> 4551.42s]  sit on it.
[4551.42s -> 4553.86s]  I'm going to do this.
[4553.86s -> 4555.86s]  And get really mad.
[4555.86s -> 4557.86s]  And get very upset that I sat on it.
[4557.86s -> 4560.22s]  Rebna?
[4560.22s -> 4563.74s]  Kalidna.
[4563.74s -> 4565.74s]  We need to know and I'm going to reload it.
[4574.10s -> 4576.10s]  Okay, that's enough of that.
[4576.10s -> 4578.10s]  That's enough of that one. That's it.
[4578.10s -> 4580.10s]  We're not doing that one again.
[4580.10s -> 4582.10s]  We're not doing that one ever again.
[4582.10s -> 4584.10s]  It's good, yeah.
[4584.10s -> 4587.10s]  And I was talking about a little recipe that I had.
[4587.10s -> 4589.10s]  If you don't know what hamburger, this is what it looks like.
[4589.10s -> 4593.25s]  It doesn't look like that.
[4593.25s -> 4595.25s]  It doesn't look like that. It looks like this.
[4595.25s -> 4606.37s]  Whip cream?
[4606.37s -> 4608.37s]  I have to wait an all week to do this one.
[4608.37s -> 4611.76s]  Alright, get in there.
[4611.76s -> 4615.60s]  I don't think I made it.
[4615.60s -> 4617.60s]  I'm assuming it missed.
[4617.60s -> 4619.60s]  I can't tell.
[4619.60s -> 4621.60s]  Do not flip the cart.
[4621.60s -> 4623.60s]  Under any circumstance. Don't do it.
[4623.60s -> 4625.60s]  It's not funny. It's not a joke.
[4625.60s -> 4627.78s]  It would be annoying
[4627.78s -> 4629.78s]  because you just wasted like 35
[4629.78s -> 4631.95s]  minutes cutting wood.
[4631.95s -> 4634.26s]  Jeremy, I know you think you're
[4634.26s -> 4636.43s]  quite the Canadian,
[4636.43s -> 4638.93s]  but this is not the time to do that.
[4638.93s -> 4644.62s]  Let's go. And a lot of people are going to think
[4644.62s -> 4646.62s]  that that was on purpose, but it was not.
[4646.62s -> 4648.99s]  And I...
[4648.99s -> 4650.99s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.
[4650.99s -> 4657.58s]  I'm going to quit the game.
[4657.58s -> 4661.68s]  I make a lot of mistakes.
[4661.68s -> 4663.68s]  I see the spam in the chat.
[4663.68s -> 4665.68s]  We're working on it.
[4665.68s -> 4668.24s]  Just relax.
[4668.24s -> 4671.12s]  We're working on it.
[4671.12s -> 4673.12s]  That's up a lot. It seems to be a theme
[4673.12s -> 4675.12s]  on the channel, doesn't it?
[4675.12s -> 4677.12s]  Let's see. Ladies and gentlemen, the winner
[4677.12s -> 4679.12s]  of Best Accident is...
[4679.12s -> 4683.54s]  Let's find out.
[4683.54s -> 4687.12s]  I mean, you
[4687.12s -> 4689.12s]  could have guessed this was going to be the one.
[4689.12s -> 4692.32s]  The mask falls off Spider-Man
[4692.32s -> 4694.32s]  at 15.6% of the vote.
[4694.32s -> 4696.75s]  Nice job, Spider-Man.
[4696.75s -> 4698.75s]  You get to see the outline of my
[4698.75s -> 4700.75s]  dick if you zoomed in.
[4700.75s -> 4702.75s]  I mean, don't do
[4702.75s -> 4704.75s]  that, but if you can see the outline of my
[4704.75s -> 4706.75s]  dick, whatever, that's fine.
[4706.75s -> 4708.75s]  My favorite ice cream, let's take a look at
[4708.75s -> 4710.75s]  11.8%,
[4710.75s -> 4713.12s]  which that's sad, because I really
[4713.12s -> 4715.12s]  do think that that is the... I think that is the
[4715.12s -> 4719.02s]  best ice cream. That's so
[4719.02s -> 4721.02s]  fucking stupid. I was so disappointed.
[4721.02s -> 4723.02s]  And then Booty Smash at 11%,
[4723.02s -> 4725.02s]  it took up...
[4725.02s -> 4727.02s]  This is pretty even.
[4727.02s -> 4729.20s]  It looks like
[4729.20s -> 4731.20s]  everything after Booty Smash
[4731.20s -> 4733.20s]  was within 1%.
[4733.20s -> 4735.20s]  So everything below that
[4735.20s -> 4737.20s]  was just within
[4737.20s -> 4739.20s]  1% of each other, so...
[4739.20s -> 4741.20s]  Make sure I'm not going to see my
[4741.20s -> 4743.20s]  dick on this stream. Okay.
[4743.20s -> 4745.20s]  Don't want to do that.
[4745.20s -> 4747.20s]  Alright, after this, we're going to take a quick
[4747.20s -> 4749.20s]  break after this, because I'm going to try to get back
[4749.20s -> 4751.20s]  on the goddamn channel.
[4751.20s -> 4753.20s]  We're going to go dark for a second,
[4753.20s -> 4755.20s]  but this is best overdone Boston
[4755.20s -> 4757.20s]  moment, if you don't know what that is.
[4757.20s -> 4759.20s]  So best overdone Boston moment, I'll give you an
[4759.20s -> 4767.71s]  example. This fucking cookie
[4767.71s -> 4770.27s]  sucks, dude. Where'd you get these fucking cookies?
[4770.27s -> 4774.11s]  In the fucking toilet?
[4774.11s -> 4776.80s]  Where'd you find this? In a fucking dumpster?
[4776.80s -> 4778.80s]  New category this year, by the way.
[4778.80s -> 4780.80s]  This is a new category.
[4780.80s -> 4782.80s]  So here are your nominees
[4782.80s -> 4784.80s]  for best overdone Boston
[4784.80s -> 4787.49s]  moment. Don't show
[4787.49s -> 4796.32s]  my dick on camera.
[4796.32s -> 4798.32s]  I know I got what he was coming to him, man. Don't worry.
[4798.32s -> 4800.32s]  I got plenty left for you, you fucking idiot.
[4800.32s -> 4802.69s]  Okay, good.
[4802.69s -> 4805.76s]  Ultimate destruction!
[4805.76s -> 4807.76s]  Yes!
[4807.76s -> 4809.76s]  It's a stupid fucking dumb fucking stupid fucking game. Fucking game's fucking stupid.
[4809.76s -> 4811.76s]  Yeah, that's fucking stupid.
[4811.76s -> 4813.76s]  Yeah!
[4813.76s -> 4815.76s]  I hate this fucking category.
[4819.34s -> 4821.34s]  Your Boston's showing.
[4821.34s -> 4823.34s]  Three, two, one.
[4823.34s -> 4825.34s]  Happy fucking New Year!
[4825.34s -> 4827.65s]  And a
[4827.65s -> 4829.65s]  dear
[4829.65s -> 4831.65s]  and a
[4831.65s -> 4833.65s]  dear old Lang Syne.
[4833.65s -> 4836.40s]  And
[4836.40s -> 4838.40s]  all the Red
[4838.40s -> 4840.40s]  Sox players
[4840.40s -> 4842.40s]  should fucking
[4842.40s -> 4844.40s]  get paid more than the
[4844.40s -> 4846.40s]  Yankees do.
[4846.40s -> 4849.15s]  And all
[4849.15s -> 4851.15s]  the patriots
[4851.15s -> 4853.15s]  who cares about Tom Brady.
[4853.15s -> 4855.15s]  He's a fucking loser.
[4855.15s -> 4857.15s]  I don't even fucking
[4857.15s -> 4859.78s]  care.
[4859.78s -> 4861.78s]  And all
[4861.78s -> 4863.78s]  the revolution
[4863.78s -> 4865.78s]  soccer team and the Bruins.
[4865.78s -> 4867.78s]  And fuck you
[4867.78s -> 4869.78s]  for fucking talking shit to me about my
[4869.78s -> 4871.78s]  mother behind my back that one time that year.
[4871.78s -> 4873.78s]  And I fucking never forgot.
[4873.78s -> 4876.46s]  Do you still consider
[4876.46s -> 4878.46s]  yourself a Bostonian?
[4878.46s -> 4880.46s]  Of course I do, kid. Did you just take Boston?
[4880.46s -> 4882.83s]  No.
[4882.83s -> 4884.83s]  That's fucking bullshit, dude.
[4884.83s -> 4886.83s]  Alright, kid, listen, that's fucking stupid.
[4886.83s -> 4888.83s]  Alright, fucking listen, kid.
[4888.83s -> 4890.83s]  I'll see you outside any
[4890.83s -> 4892.83s]  donkeys anytime. Oh, shut the fuck up.
[4892.83s -> 4894.83s]  You bring a pack of cigarettes and I'll fucking see you there.
[4894.83s -> 4896.83s]  Hey, hey, hey.
[4896.83s -> 4899.52s]  Hey. What are those
[4899.52s -> 4901.52s]  brown slacks called?
[4901.52s -> 4903.52s]  Oh, they're called cockies.
[4903.52s -> 4905.76s]  How do you drive your car?
[4905.76s -> 4907.76s]  Oh, with fucking cockies.
[4909.76s -> 4911.76s]  Jeremy, you're spending so much fucking time with these ants.
[4911.76s -> 4914.45s]  I mean, there's other shit to do with them.
[4914.45s -> 4916.45s]  You're spending a lot of time with these fucking ants.
[4916.45s -> 4918.45s]  I can't believe I did this this much.
[4918.45s -> 4920.45s]  You've been outside a lot.
[4920.45s -> 4922.45s]  You're just like digging around looking for fucking ants.
[4922.45s -> 4924.45s]  I don't know what is
[4924.45s -> 4926.45s]  getting a little concerned about you.
[4926.45s -> 4928.45s]  I love how I've turned
[4928.45s -> 4930.45s]  you guys like the Boston accent
[4930.45s -> 4932.45s]  guy into things that
[4932.45s -> 4934.45s]  like I'm allowed to kind of come out of
[4934.45s -> 4936.45s]  my like I can just say whatever I want
[4936.45s -> 4938.45s]  as that voice, that character.
[4938.45s -> 4940.45s]  And it's universally despised
[4940.45s -> 4942.45s]  anything I say. I don't know why it has to be like
[4942.45s -> 4944.45s]  the Boston guy with the cigarette
[4944.45s -> 4946.45s]  outside of a CVS.
[4946.45s -> 4948.45s]  I don't know why it has to be that guy.
[4948.45s -> 4952.35s]  I wish they were
[4952.35s -> 4954.35s]  fucking two drive-throughs, three drive-through windows
[4954.35s -> 4956.35s]  instead of one at like every restaurant.
[4956.35s -> 4959.49s]  Alright, dude, like
[4959.49s -> 4963.82s]  Okay. This fucking game
[4963.82s -> 4968.56s]  is fucking stupid.
[4968.56s -> 4971.95s]  Where does it want me to go?
[4971.95s -> 4973.95s]  Chad, do you fucking, what was it?
[4973.95s -> 4978.62s]  This game is for fucking kids. I don't give a fuck.
[4978.62s -> 4982.21s]  I'm playing a fucking kids game.
[4982.21s -> 4984.21s]  And you guys are fucking shit in the fucking chat.
[4984.21s -> 4986.96s]  Yeah, okay.
[4986.96s -> 4989.78s]  Pickle nose, pickle nose.
[4989.78s -> 4992.34s]  Fucking say that?
[4992.34s -> 4994.51s]  Pickle nose?
[4994.51s -> 4996.51s]  Fuck up.
[4996.51s -> 5000.48s]  What's up, dude?
[5000.48s -> 5002.48s]  That armor is pretty fucking cool. That's pretty sick armor.
[5002.48s -> 5004.48s]  I can't take this anymore.
[5004.48s -> 5006.48s]  I mean, I got magic defense
[5006.48s -> 5008.48s]  on it, though, pretty fucking low.
[5008.48s -> 5010.48s]  With just two more minutes.
[5010.48s -> 5012.48s]  My tail light does stuff like that, too, but magic is pretty low on it, right?
[5012.48s -> 5014.48s]  Alright, fuck. Alright, kid.
[5014.48s -> 5016.48s]  Alright, I'll fucking see you later.
[5016.48s -> 5020.51s]  Hey, mom, I said hi.
[5020.51s -> 5022.51s]  I don't know, not in like a weird, you know what I mean?
[5022.51s -> 5024.51s]  That was like supposed to be respectful.
[5024.51s -> 5026.51s]  That was not supposed to be mean.
[5026.51s -> 5031.76s]  I weren't ready for the fucking rain of stars.
[5031.76s -> 5033.76s]  Hey.
[5033.76s -> 5035.76s]  What about, you know, fucking starlight, kid?
[5035.76s -> 5037.76s]  Oh, fucking starlight.
[5037.76s -> 5039.76s]  I fucking hate this.
[5039.76s -> 5041.76s]  I'm annoying.
[5041.76s -> 5043.76s]  How do we cut this category off quick?
[5043.76s -> 5045.76s]  I'm farming for souls, so I don't want to die at the boss.
[5045.76s -> 5047.76s]  The boss is probably going to be hard.
[5047.76s -> 5049.76s]  Oh, you're causing
[5049.76s -> 5052.26s]  from Boston.
[5052.26s -> 5054.26s]  It's a fucking lager. You don't know what a lager is, dude?
[5054.26s -> 5056.26s]  I'm your causing.
[5056.26s -> 5058.69s]  I wasn't looking.
[5058.69s -> 5060.69s]  Oh, so I was back in Massachusetts, right?
[5060.69s -> 5062.69s]  Because I'm saying it's going to be the wedding stuff.
[5062.69s -> 5065.18s]  And I could tell I was back in
[5065.18s -> 5067.18s]  Massachusetts. It's been a while.
[5067.18s -> 5069.18s]  I was driving.
[5069.18s -> 5071.18s]  And I just hear
[5071.18s -> 5073.18s]  I'm just sitting there and I pull up through a red light.
[5073.18s -> 5075.18s]  And I just hear out the window.
[5075.18s -> 5077.18s]  You fucking
[5077.18s -> 5079.18s]  douchebag.
[5079.18s -> 5081.18s]  Somebody was just screaming at somebody.
[5081.18s -> 5083.18s]  They do just kind of stand here. They're all fucking
[5083.18s -> 5085.62s]  terrible. Hey, what's
[5085.62s -> 5087.62s]  in the telescope? What are you looking at, Maz?
[5087.62s -> 5089.62s]  Look at that.
[5089.62s -> 5091.62s]  Oh, look at this artwork.
[5091.62s -> 5093.62s]  Look at this artwork.
[5093.62s -> 5095.62s]  Why is it snowing?
[5095.62s -> 5097.62s]  That fucking foxy comes out of there.
[5097.62s -> 5099.86s]  I heard this.
[5099.86s -> 5101.86s]  My fucking son played this one.
[5101.86s -> 5103.86s]  Fucking foxy comes out of there and sprints down the fucking hallway.
[5103.86s -> 5105.86s]  It was fucked up.
[5105.86s -> 5107.86s]  They walk down halls and stuff. They fucking walk down the hall.
[5107.86s -> 5109.86s]  I played it before.
[5109.86s -> 5111.86s]  Wait.
[5111.86s -> 5115.57s]  Oh, shit. There it is.
[5115.57s -> 5118.64s]  Okay.
[5118.64s -> 5120.64s]  I'll fucking drop this guy if he fucking comes in my...
[5120.64s -> 5122.64s]  If he comes over to the door, I'm going to fucking drop him.
[5122.64s -> 5124.64s]  Apparently, I have a catchphrase
[5124.64s -> 5126.64s]  between me and my girlfriend that I don't even realize I have it.
[5126.64s -> 5128.88s]  And apparently, I say
[5128.88s -> 5130.88s]  like, oh, fucking like, gollick.
[5130.88s -> 5132.88s]  Gollick, kid. Oh, yeah, give me some fucking
[5132.88s -> 5134.88s]  gollick, dude. For no reason,
[5134.88s -> 5136.88s]  apparently. And I'm like, no, there has to be a reason
[5136.88s -> 5138.88s]  of why I'm saying like, oh, fucking gollick.
[5138.88s -> 5140.88s]  I just do like a Boston accent
[5140.88s -> 5142.88s]  joke. And I say gollick.
[5142.88s -> 5151.20s]  Okay. So,
[5151.20s -> 5153.20s]  the winner for...
[5153.20s -> 5155.20s]  Is it best or worst? That's the question I have.
[5155.20s -> 5157.20s]  It's best
[5157.20s -> 5159.20s]  overdone Boston moment.
[5159.20s -> 5161.20s]  Not worst overdone Boston moment.
[5161.20s -> 5165.23s]  People saying Maz. Maz
[5165.23s -> 5167.23s]  is the one. I don't know. I actually...
[5167.23s -> 5169.23s]  Let's find out. Ladies and gentlemen,
[5169.23s -> 5171.23s]  the winner of the
[5171.23s -> 5173.23s]  worst overdone Boston
[5173.23s -> 5175.23s]  moment.
[5175.23s -> 5179.71s]  Really?
[5179.71s -> 5181.71s]  It's the gollick catchphrase
[5181.71s -> 5183.71s]  story at 22.2%
[5183.71s -> 5185.71s]  of the vote.
[5185.71s -> 5188.21s]  Gollick catchphrase.
[5188.21s -> 5190.21s]  Me explaining that I have a catchphrase.
[5190.21s -> 5192.21s]  And then the Tom Brady
[5192.21s -> 5194.21s]  New Year's Eve song
[5194.21s -> 5196.21s]  at 11...
[5196.21s -> 5198.21s]  Okay. 11.8%
[5198.21s -> 5200.21s]  for the New Year's Eve song.
[5200.21s -> 5202.21s]  And then the Boston guy plays
[5202.21s -> 5204.21s]  Five Nights at Freddy's
[5204.21s -> 5206.21s]  at 10%.
[5206.21s -> 5208.21s]  Also, keep this in mind, that was the second
[5208.21s -> 5210.21s]  most skipped category.
[5210.21s -> 5212.21s]  Under cat puke.
[5212.21s -> 5214.21s]  Nobody gave a shit
[5214.21s -> 5216.21s]  about that one. I don't
[5216.21s -> 5218.21s]  blame them. I really don't.
[5218.21s -> 5220.21s]  It's funny just how many things people did skip.
[5220.21s -> 5222.64s]  People probably went to this list
[5222.64s -> 5224.64s]  and saw... I ain't taking all 27
[5224.64s -> 5226.64s]  of these.
[5226.64s -> 5228.64s]  No, I'm skipping this, we're skipping this, we're skipping this.
[5228.64s -> 5230.64s]  This is the second most skipped category,
[5230.64s -> 5232.64s]  which makes sense.
[5232.64s -> 5234.64s]  Why don't we check in with the elves?
[5234.64s -> 5236.64s]  How are the elves doing on the puzzle?
[5236.64s -> 5239.07s]  Can we go take a look? How are they?
[5239.07s -> 5242.08s]  Elves, how are you?
[5242.08s -> 5244.32s]  They haven't done
[5244.32s -> 5247.33s]  anything.
[5247.33s -> 5249.33s]  It just looks like you've poured a box
[5249.33s -> 5251.33s]  of fruity pebbles on the ground.
[5251.33s -> 5253.33s]  There's nothing even there.
[5253.33s -> 5258.13s]  Let's stay
[5258.13s -> 5261.65s]  with them for a few minutes.
[5261.65s -> 5463.50s]  I gotta go pee. Hey, who cares
[5463.50s -> 5465.50s]  if they get your channel hacked on Christmas time?
[5465.50s -> 5467.50s]  Right? Who cares?
[5467.50s -> 5469.50s]  Welcome back, everybody. Welcome to
[5469.50s -> 5471.50s]  the awards show.
[5471.50s -> 5473.50s]  Christmas special. Yes!
[5473.50s -> 5475.50s]  Come on!
[5475.50s -> 5477.87s]  Where is it if there's somebody playing Call of Duty
[5477.87s -> 5479.87s]  on my channel right now?
[5479.87s -> 5481.87s]  Fuck them, right?
[5481.87s -> 5483.87s]  We're gonna have fun over here.
[5483.87s -> 5485.87s]  What about the elves? What's wrong with
[5485.87s -> 5488.43s]  the elves?
[5488.43s -> 5490.43s]  It doesn't look like they just poured, like I said, a box of
[5490.43s -> 5492.43s]  cereal on the ground. They haven't made any progress
[5492.43s -> 5494.43s]  at all. Absolutely
[5494.43s -> 5499.17s]  zero progress.
[5499.17s -> 5501.17s]  Okay, so
[5501.17s -> 5503.47s]  how does it look today?
[5503.47s -> 5506.61s]  How does it look? We're doing that one now.
[5506.61s -> 5509.36s]  This is the
[5509.36s -> 5511.36s]  eighth category of the night.
[5511.36s -> 5514.94s]  Hey, how's that for you?
[5514.94s -> 5517.87s]  How's that look? This is worst
[5517.87s -> 5519.87s]  hair, not today, but, you know,
[5519.87s -> 5521.87s]  I've had some bad hair.
[5521.87s -> 5523.87s]  Most of these are from VR,
[5523.87s -> 5525.87s]  which is kind of unfair, if I'm honest.
[5525.87s -> 5528.56s]  I just heard the production
[5528.56s -> 5530.56s]  go, don't open that!
[5530.56s -> 5532.56s]  Alright, so ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees
[5532.56s -> 5534.56s]  for worst hair of the year.
[5534.56s -> 5544.42s]  Can we please
[5544.42s -> 5558.03s]  get a zoinks? Fine.
[5558.03s -> 5560.34s]  Zoinks, Scoob!
[5560.34s -> 5562.34s]  I fucking banned that person. I actually banned that person
[5562.34s -> 5564.34s]  for like an hour, because they just made me do that
[5564.34s -> 5566.34s]  and I fucking hated it.
[5566.34s -> 5573.38s]  Want a hair check? Sure. Hold on
[5573.38s -> 5584.24s]  one sec. How are we?
[5584.24s -> 5589.30s]  I think it's because
[5589.30s -> 5591.30s]  I like went to
[5591.30s -> 5593.30s]  my hair has a weird growing pattern.
[5593.30s -> 5595.30s]  Is it that bad? Alright, it is bad.
[5595.30s -> 5597.30s]  But listen, my
[5597.30s -> 5599.30s]  hair is a lot thinner here.
[5599.30s -> 5601.30s]  Look at how much thicker my hair is here.
[5601.30s -> 5603.30s]  Do you see?
[5603.30s -> 5605.30s]  It's really, I have really thick hair
[5605.30s -> 5607.30s]  here, and really thin hair
[5607.30s -> 5609.30s]  here. I didn't shave this.
[5609.30s -> 5614.48s]  You know what, I don't even care, just fuck the whole thing up.
[5614.48s -> 5627.71s]  What is going on?
[5627.71s -> 5629.71s]  I do look like a big
[5629.71s -> 5631.71s]  kid. What's happening right now?
[5631.71s -> 5633.71s]  I look like a big kid.
[5633.71s -> 5635.71s]  What's going on?
[5635.71s -> 5638.02s]  He's balding? I mean
[5638.02s -> 5640.02s]  yeah. Not really though.
[5640.02s -> 5642.02s]  I'm 36. Not really.
[5642.02s -> 5644.02s]  You dream you look like this
[5644.02s -> 5646.02s]  when you're 36. He's right.
[5646.02s -> 5648.02s]  You dream, keep dreaming you'll look as good as I do
[5648.02s -> 5650.02s]  right now. He's right. Listen to him.
[5650.02s -> 5652.02s]  Can they hear me? Keep dreaming.
[5652.02s -> 5654.70s]  Wait, let me say that again when it looks better.
[5654.70s -> 5657.07s]  You're not going to get away
[5657.07s -> 5659.31s]  with that.
[5659.31s -> 5665.70s]  They probably heard that.
[5665.70s -> 5669.86s]  It's really great.
[5669.86s -> 5671.86s]  I don't know why. This thing was expensive too.
[5671.86s -> 5673.86s]  What if I go like up this way?
[5673.86s -> 5688.62s]  We're trying a new hairstyle.
[5688.62s -> 5690.62s]  This is just Donald Trump's hair.
[5690.62s -> 5692.86s]  On my head.
[5692.86s -> 5695.62s]  My hair looks like
[5695.62s -> 5697.62s]  it came out of the oven and it's
[5697.62s -> 5700.88s]  done. This looks like
[5700.88s -> 5705.23s]  cooked hair. My hair
[5705.23s -> 5707.23s]  looks different. It's done now. It's ready.
[5707.23s -> 5709.23s]  I wanted to stream today.
[5709.23s -> 5711.79s]  Why do your sideburns look like
[5711.79s -> 5714.35s]  pubes?
[5714.35s -> 5718.64s]  I haven't seen this video.
[5718.64s -> 5725.02s]  Dude I
[5725.02s -> 5727.02s]  don't know. I haven't had a haircut
[5727.02s -> 5729.02s]  yet. Oh man.
[5729.02s -> 5731.90s]  He looks off.
[5731.90s -> 5734.46s]  Maybe you think it's because of this?
[5734.46s -> 5736.46s]  Do you think it has anything to do with
[5736.46s -> 5738.46s]  whatever this is right now?
[5738.46s -> 5740.46s]  Do you think it has anything to do with how off I look
[5740.46s -> 5742.70s]  today? I wonder if you think it
[5742.70s -> 5751.09s]  has anything to do with this?
[5751.09s -> 5754.86s]  Pube hair. Okay.
[5754.86s -> 5758.32s]  Look. Before I open this.
[5758.32s -> 5760.88s]  I'm 37.
[5760.88s -> 5763.70s]  You get older. Your hair gets a little
[5763.70s -> 5765.70s]  scraggly. It gets a little weird. But
[5765.70s -> 5767.70s]  it's still there. I still have
[5767.70s -> 5769.70s]  it all. I know people that
[5769.70s -> 5771.70s]  are way younger than me.
[5771.70s -> 5773.70s]  And some that are way older than me.
[5773.70s -> 5775.70s]  That do not have this.
[5775.70s -> 5777.70s]  Oh look at your hairline. Look at that.
[5777.70s -> 5779.70s]  Oh wow. Oh yeah. You'll see.
[5779.70s -> 5781.70s]  When you're almost 40 you come talk to me. How does that
[5781.70s -> 5783.70s]  sound? When you're almost 40 you come talk to me.
[5783.70s -> 5785.70s]  The winner.
[5785.70s -> 5787.70s]  Of worst hair.
[5787.70s -> 5789.70s]  Of the year is.
[5792.90s -> 5795.52s]  It was close.
[5795.52s -> 5797.52s]  22.1%
[5797.52s -> 5799.52s]  of the vote. What do you think it was?
[5799.52s -> 5801.95s]  Chad, what do you think?
[5801.95s -> 5809.23s]  Let me see. Off Andy?
[5809.23s -> 5811.23s]  Off? He looks off? No.
[5811.23s -> 5814.75s]  Not even close. The winner is
[5814.75s -> 5816.75s]  pubesideburns at 22%
[5816.75s -> 5818.75s]  of that. Okay.
[5818.75s -> 5820.75s]  Greasy cooked hair at
[5820.75s -> 5822.75s]  19%. And then
[5822.75s -> 5824.75s]  shaggy hair gets a
[5824.75s -> 5826.75s]  chat member banned
[5826.75s -> 5828.75s]  at 11.7% of the vote.
[5828.75s -> 5830.75s]  So pubesideburns.
[5830.75s -> 5832.75s]  Pubesideburns wins.
[5832.75s -> 5834.75s]  Alright. The next one.
[5834.75s -> 5836.75s]  How does this sound?
[5836.75s -> 5838.99s]  Let's get to best dancing.
[5838.99s -> 5841.23s]  Which there were some
[5841.23s -> 5843.23s]  I did a lot of good dancing this year.
[5843.23s -> 5845.23s]  I'm going to open it but I'm not going to look at it yet.
[5845.23s -> 5847.23s]  I'm not going to look at it yet.
[5847.23s -> 5849.23s]  I just want to get it ready. So you don't
[5849.23s -> 5851.73s]  hear the sound effects.
[5851.73s -> 5853.73s]  At best dancing, I know I've hit the
[5853.73s -> 5855.73s]  Luddy a few good times this year.
[5855.73s -> 5857.73s]  I know I did the orangutan, which
[5857.73s -> 5859.73s]  didn't even get nominated. So what the heck's going on
[5859.73s -> 5861.73s]  there, guys? Thanks a lot.
[5861.73s -> 5863.73s]  That's my dance. The orangutan.
[5863.73s -> 5865.73s]  Doesn't even get nominated.
[5865.73s -> 5869.06s]  The hacker wants to
[5869.06s -> 5872.58s]  1v1 you.
[5872.58s -> 5874.58s]  I don't know what that means.
[5874.58s -> 5876.58s]  We'll figure that out when we get back.
[5876.58s -> 5878.58s]  But here are your nominees for best dancing of the
[5878.58s -> 5880.58s]  year. Here are your nominees.
[5880.58s -> 5889.28s]  Right now.
[5889.28s -> 5891.28s]  Somebody said hit the Luddy. All right. How do you do it?
[5900.74s -> 5902.74s]  How's that?
[5902.74s -> 5904.74s]  I'm an actor. I act
[5904.74s -> 5912.10s]  for a living.
[5912.10s -> 5914.10s]  Can you fucking trick that?
[5914.10s -> 5926.51s]  Go for it.
[5926.51s -> 5932.45s]  It's all right.
[5932.45s -> 5957.86s]  Feed him to the lions.
[5957.86s -> 5961.12s]  Yeah, feed him.
[5961.12s -> 5963.12s]  Feed him to the lions. Don't you think?
[5963.12s -> 5971.89s]  I don't know how to twerk.
[5971.89s -> 5975.15s]  You can't resident sleep for this, can you?
[5975.15s -> 5978.22s]  Fucking jokers.
[5978.22s -> 5993.50s]  Tay, can you twerk? Yeah.
[5993.50s -> 5995.50s]  You think you can beat me? I know I can beat you.
[5995.50s -> 5997.50s]  I don't know what I'm going to beat you at. Oh, you know you can beat me.
[5997.50s -> 5999.50s]  Go ahead and cue the music.
[5999.50s -> 6001.50s]  Good luck.
[6001.50s -> 6004.64s]  Weird monopoly man.
[6004.64s -> 6010.91s]  Swedish monopoly man.
[6010.91s -> 6012.91s]  What is planned?
[6012.91s -> 6017.84s]  You guys synchronized this?
[6017.84s -> 6019.84s]  How are you doing it so well saved?
[6019.84s -> 6021.84s]  Nobody beats me at my own game. This is incredible.
[6023.84s -> 6025.84s]  These moves.
[6025.84s -> 6027.84s]  New German.
[6027.84s -> 6029.84s]  New German.
[6029.84s -> 6031.84s]  New German.
[6031.84s -> 6033.84s]  Here we go.
[6033.84s -> 6035.84s]  He had moves the whole time.
[6035.84s -> 6037.84s]  One handed.
[6037.84s -> 6039.84s]  New German.
[6039.84s -> 6041.84s]  Did you do the goofy
[6041.84s -> 6045.94s]  goober dance?
[6045.94s -> 6047.94s]  If it's not Char, then it's me.
[6047.94s -> 6049.94s]  Then vote for me next time.
[6049.94s -> 6051.94s]  Exactly.
[6051.94s -> 6053.94s]  Don't vote for me.
[6053.94s -> 6055.94s]  I didn't do anything.
[6055.94s -> 6057.94s]  But you did.
[6057.94s -> 6064.21s]  So your winner
[6064.21s -> 6066.21s]  for best dancing
[6066.21s -> 6070.62s]  is
[6070.62s -> 6076.94s]  So you think you can beat
[6076.94s -> 6078.94s]  me at 21%
[6078.94s -> 6080.94s]  of the vote? Very close.
[6080.94s -> 6083.12s]  Hit the Luddie
[6083.12s -> 6085.12s]  was 20.2%.
[6085.12s -> 6087.12s]  It was literally 1% difference.
[6087.12s -> 6089.74s]  And then twerking king
[6089.74s -> 6091.74s]  was 17%. But hit the Luddie
[6091.74s -> 6093.74s]  and think you can beat me.
[6093.74s -> 6095.74s]  Very close.
[6095.74s -> 6097.74s]  I was on stage. I had a whole suit on.
[6097.74s -> 6099.74s]  Come on.
[6099.74s -> 6101.74s]  This next category, we're going to get right through this.
[6101.74s -> 6103.74s]  I have 1v1.
[6103.74s -> 6105.74s]  I don't know what the fuck he's talking about.
[6105.74s -> 6107.74s]  I wish
[6107.74s -> 6109.74s]  I knew. I have no idea what he wants.
[6109.74s -> 6111.74s]  He's got ownership of that channel
[6111.74s -> 6113.74s]  right now.
[6113.74s -> 6115.74s]  Don't think about it too much.
[6115.74s -> 6117.74s]  Easy.
[6117.74s -> 6119.74s]  During the break I calm down a little bit.
[6119.74s -> 6121.74s]  But it's kind of hard to.
[6121.74s -> 6123.74s]  So this is
[6123.74s -> 6125.74s]  best auto moment.
[6125.74s -> 6127.74s]  And best auto moment is a great
[6127.74s -> 6129.74s]  category considering that I think every
[6129.74s -> 6131.74s]  single nominee on this list
[6131.74s -> 6133.74s]  were the only times auto was shown on screen.
[6133.74s -> 6135.74s]  I think it's five times
[6135.74s -> 6137.74s]  or six times over the year. So there's six
[6137.74s -> 6139.74s]  nominees. And here they are.
[6139.74s -> 6141.74s]  For best auto moment.
[6141.74s -> 6154.72s]  Auto.
[6154.72s -> 6159.78s]  You seem like we've had turkey now.
[6159.78s -> 6164.19s]  He was very sleepy.
[6164.19s -> 6168.91s]  Are you tired? Maybe it's a good idea
[6168.91s -> 6170.91s]  to just turn the VPN on. And have it just kind of
[6170.91s -> 6172.91s]  go somewhere else and have the traffic
[6172.91s -> 6182.70s]  come in a circle.
[6182.70s -> 6185.26s]  He knows there's a treat. He's right here.
[6185.26s -> 6187.57s]  God, he needs to lose some weight.
[6187.57s -> 6189.87s]  Say hello, Akio.
[6189.87s -> 6192.30s]  He's so chunky.
[6192.30s -> 6194.86s]  He needs to lose at least
[6194.86s -> 6197.17s]  a pound or two.
[6197.17s -> 6203.95s]  He's very chunky.
[6203.95s -> 6206.58s]  He's snoring.
[6206.58s -> 6208.58s]  He's doing that like
[6208.58s -> 6210.94s]  He's like dreaming and snoring at the same time.
[6210.94s -> 6216.26s]  Yes, he has two beds.
[6216.26s -> 6218.26s]  He's like Snoopy. He doesn't like that one.
[6218.26s -> 6220.94s]  How do I really feel?
[6220.94s -> 6223.25s]  He's a C.
[6223.25s -> 6226.37s]  He went from F to C.
[6226.37s -> 6231.17s]  There's a little too buttery at the end.
[6231.17s -> 6233.41s]  Oh, it's over Cantaloupe for sure.
[6233.41s -> 6235.41s]  It's over Pepsi for sure.
[6235.41s -> 6239.31s]  The same stream.
[6239.31s -> 6246.67s]  It's just in the corner.
[6246.67s -> 6256.21s]  I mean, they all win.
[6256.21s -> 6258.21s]  It's every single one wins.
[6258.21s -> 6260.21s]  There's no winner for best auto
[6260.21s -> 6262.21s]  moment. It's just anytime he's on
[6262.21s -> 6264.38s]  camera, it's fun.
[6264.38s -> 6266.38s]  It's best. Do we need to even
[6266.38s -> 6268.38s]  declare a winner? Can they all win?
[6268.38s -> 6270.38s]  They all win, I think.
[6270.38s -> 6272.38s]  But wow.
[6272.38s -> 6274.38s]  Whoa, actually, this is crazy.
[6274.38s -> 6276.38s]  Best auto moment of the year is
[6276.38s -> 6279.20s]  at 48%
[6279.20s -> 6281.20s]  of the vote.
[6281.20s -> 6283.20s]  Sleepy auto in
[6283.20s -> 6285.63s]  Jerma's arms. And then at
[6285.63s -> 6287.63s]  19% snoring in the cheaper
[6287.63s -> 6289.63s]  bed. And then 11%
[6289.63s -> 6291.63s]  is auto is a little chunky.
[6291.63s -> 6293.63s]  It always gets chunky.
[6293.63s -> 6295.63s]  What? Who is talking in my ear?
[6295.63s -> 6297.63s]  Who's what?
[6297.63s -> 6299.87s]  Hello, Jerma.
[6299.87s -> 6301.87s]  What's up, dude? I've got
[6301.87s -> 6303.87s]  a proposal for you.
[6303.87s -> 6305.87s]  I've already heard about it. People have been coming
[6305.87s -> 6307.87s]  over here. How's your stream
[6307.87s -> 6309.87s]  going, by the way? My stream?
[6309.87s -> 6311.87s]  Yeah. How's your stream going? It's going
[6311.87s -> 6314.11s]  great. It's going great.
[6314.11s -> 6316.11s]  How's the Call of Duty
[6316.11s -> 6318.11s]  campaign? How's that going?
[6318.11s -> 6320.11s]  You get through the first part yet? People love it.
[6320.11s -> 6322.11s]  I'm on the second level.
[6322.11s -> 6324.11s]  It's, it's, I'm quite good.
[6324.11s -> 6326.11s]  People are asking for hot tips
[6326.11s -> 6328.11s]  and I've been giving them out.
[6328.11s -> 6330.11s]  Okay. So, and what
[6330.11s -> 6332.11s]  can I do for you? I've heard this, oh, there's a 1v1
[6332.11s -> 6334.11s]  scenario that we're going to do. Yes, well, do you want
[6334.11s -> 6336.11s]  your stream back or not? I'm feeling Christmasy.
[6336.11s -> 6338.11s]  Yep.
[6338.11s -> 6340.11s]  I'm feeling, I'm feeling in the
[6340.11s -> 6342.48s]  mood. And you're feeling
[6342.48s -> 6344.48s]  in the mood for what, exactly? You want a 1v1
[6344.48s -> 6346.48s]  me and Call of Duty and I destroy you and I get
[6346.48s -> 6348.48s]  the channel back. Is that what it is? That's right.
[6348.48s -> 6350.48s]  That's your proposal? That's the proposal.
[6350.48s -> 6352.48s]  Yes.
[6352.48s -> 6354.48s]  So, let me, let me, let me just like make sure I break this down
[6354.48s -> 6356.48s]  completely. If I
[6356.48s -> 6358.48s]  beat you in a 1v1 in Call of Duty.
[6358.48s -> 6360.48s]  That's right. You will give me
[6360.48s -> 6362.48s]  the channel back. That's right.
[6362.48s -> 6364.48s]  No bullshit. I've set up the
[6364.48s -> 6366.48s]  lobby and everything. First to five,
[6366.48s -> 6368.48s]  best of three. First to five, best of three.
[6368.48s -> 6370.48s]  And you're not messing around or anything. This is for real.
[6370.48s -> 6372.48s]  Oh, no, no. I wouldn't lie to you,
[6372.48s -> 6374.48s]  Jerma. Is he lying? I don't lie.
[6374.48s -> 6376.48s]  You lie.
[6376.48s -> 6378.48s]  Do you, do you have me over, do, do, do,
[6378.48s -> 6380.48s]  do you get the information from him?
[6380.48s -> 6384.90s]  You should have it. Do you have it?
[6384.90s -> 6386.90s]  Yeah. Well, I, so, so if I win, I get the
[6386.90s -> 6388.90s]  channel back. If you win,
[6388.90s -> 6390.90s]  you get the channel back. Let's fucking go. Let's go
[6390.90s -> 6392.90s]  then. Let's go. I, I need
[6392.90s -> 6394.90s]  some, I need some support back here, please.
[6394.90s -> 6396.90s]  What do you need?
[6396.90s -> 6398.90s]  I need, excuse me,
[6398.90s -> 6400.90s]  I need a little bit of support here.
[6400.90s -> 6402.90s]  I don't know anything about Call of Duty. Time to focus up.
[6402.90s -> 6404.90s]  Thanks, thanks. Time to focus up. Look alive. Open your mouth.
[6404.90s -> 6406.90s]  Open your mouth. What is this, a team?
[6406.90s -> 6408.90s]  What are we,
[6408.90s -> 6410.90s]  boxing? Focus up. You're supposed to do it
[6410.90s -> 6412.90s]  very gently. We've done bro versus bro.
[6412.90s -> 6414.90s]  We know you're not the best gamer. You're going to have to focus.
[6414.90s -> 6416.90s]  Stop, stop, stop. Boxer dropped out. We need this.
[6416.90s -> 6418.90s]  Listen, listen to me. We need this. Quiet.
[6418.90s -> 6420.90s]  Quiet.
[6420.90s -> 6422.90s]  What's the loadout, what's the best loadout
[6422.90s -> 6424.90s]  in Call of Duty Modern Warfare? Can you get him off the fucking screen
[6424.90s -> 6426.90s]  before I puke? What is that?
[6426.90s -> 6428.90s]  Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. I think your play
[6428.90s -> 6430.90s]  style's a run and gun. Did you just put make-up
[6430.90s -> 6432.90s]  on me? What, submachine gun? What did you just do?
[6432.90s -> 6434.90s]  War paint. Did you just put war paint on?
[6434.90s -> 6436.90s]  War paint. This is going to be off for the rest of the
[6436.90s -> 6438.90s]  day now. What the hell?
[6438.90s -> 6440.90s]  You're ready. Just believe in yourself.
[6440.90s -> 6442.90s]  What's worse, having paint on your face
[6442.90s -> 6444.90s]  for the rest of the day or having him on your channel for the rest of the day?
[6444.90s -> 6446.90s]  Think about that. Come on.
[6446.90s -> 6448.90s]  Do or die. Hey, are you a fan
[6448.90s -> 6451.78s]  of Lugwig? Variety
[6451.78s -> 6453.78s]  streamer. Do you know Lugwig at all?
[6453.78s -> 6455.78s]  Hello? Do you know Atreyok at all?
[6455.78s -> 6457.78s]  Oh, you're talking to me. I'm sorry,
[6457.78s -> 6459.78s]  I'm setting up the game for you because you don't know how to play.
[6459.78s -> 6461.78s]  Alright, alright, alright. It's time.
[6461.78s -> 6463.78s]  Am I ready?
[6463.78s -> 6465.78s]  1 v 1, I get the channel back.
[6465.78s -> 6467.78s]  Alright, so first to five.
[6467.78s -> 6469.78s]  I'll put a ten minute limit on it. Can I get everybody
[6469.78s -> 6471.78s]  in here, please? I need
[6471.78s -> 6473.78s]  support, I need to be taught how to do this shit.
[6473.78s -> 6475.78s]  Tighten up, tighten up.
[6477.78s -> 6479.78s]  What's your class? What's your class?
[6479.78s -> 6481.78s]  I don't know what class means, Lugwig. Submachine gun.
[6481.78s -> 6483.78s]  Long, light machine gun.
[6483.78s -> 6485.78s]  Machine gun. I don't know what
[6485.78s -> 6487.78s]  any of this means.
[6487.78s -> 6489.78s]  Am I in the lobby?
[6489.78s -> 6491.78s]  Just focus, don't worry about it yet.
[6491.78s -> 6493.78s]  Why is Lugwig going to buy stuff in the stores?
[6493.78s -> 6495.78s]  He's buying things. How do I get this off?
[6495.78s -> 6497.78s]  This is going to be on all day. Look, it comes off easy.
[6497.78s -> 6502.64s]  It'll come off, it'll come off.
[6502.64s -> 6504.64s]  Did I get an invite?
[6504.64s -> 6506.64s]  Why are you buying the skin?
[6506.64s -> 6508.64s]  I was buying the bundle.
[6508.64s -> 6510.64s]  Who the fuck are you?
[6510.64s -> 6512.64s]  I'm the engineer. Oh, you were sitting here, sorry.
[6512.64s -> 6514.64s]  Extinguisher, that's gotta be...
[6514.64s -> 6516.64s]  Come on, come on, come on.
[6518.64s -> 6520.64s]  Can somebody get me a snack, please?
[6520.64s -> 6522.64s]  Alright.
[6522.64s -> 6524.64s]  Snacks!
[6524.64s -> 6526.64s]  Snacks! Snacks!
[6526.64s -> 6528.64s]  Snacks! Snacks! Snacks!
[6528.64s -> 6530.64s]  I don't want that.
[6530.64s -> 6532.64s]  I don't want that either.
[6532.64s -> 6534.64s]  You want me to chew it up?
[6534.64s -> 6536.64s]  I can chew it up for you.
[6536.64s -> 6538.64s]  Do you need water?
[6538.64s -> 6540.64s]  Okay, Jeremy, you get yourself a little juice box.
[6540.64s -> 6542.64s]  You get yourself some face paint.
[6542.64s -> 6544.64s]  Alright, go, go, go!
[6544.64s -> 6546.64s]  Everyone, I want to start a chant.
[6546.64s -> 6548.64s]  Are you ready?
[6548.64s -> 6550.64s]  Let's get this motherfucker!
[6550.64s -> 6552.64s]  Let's get this motherfucker!
[6552.64s -> 6554.64s]  Let's get this motherfucker!
[6554.64s -> 6556.64s]  Let's get this motherfucker!
[6556.64s -> 6558.64s]  Let's get this motherfucker!
[6558.64s -> 6564.27s]  Are you sure you're ready, Jeremy?
[6564.27s -> 6566.27s]  Go.
[6566.27s -> 6568.27s]  Your whole existence is on the line right now.
[6568.27s -> 6570.27s]  This engineer was on Facebook
[6570.27s -> 6572.27s]  for like the last probably hour.
[6572.27s -> 6574.27s]  Who have you been writing to on here?
[6574.27s -> 6576.27s]  Still one of the most popular websites in Europe
[6576.27s -> 6578.27s]  for like social media.
[6578.27s -> 6580.27s]  Alright, you ready? Let's go.
[6580.27s -> 6582.27s]  Let's go, extinguisher.
[6582.27s -> 6584.27s]  You're the extinguisher?
[6584.27s -> 6586.27s]  What is this? Nutri-grain bar?
[6586.27s -> 6588.27s]  What is this thing?
[6588.27s -> 6591.79s]  Fuel.
[6591.79s -> 6594.67s]  No.
[6594.67s -> 6596.67s]  Where are you running to, my friend?
[6596.67s -> 6599.23s]  Okay.
[6599.23s -> 6601.23s]  It's just waiting for host. Are you the host?
[6601.23s -> 6603.23s]  Yes, I'm the host.
[6603.23s -> 6605.23s]  You have to make the call.
[6605.23s -> 6607.23s]  Oh, I gotta send you another invite
[6607.23s -> 6609.23s]  because you don't know how to play.
[6609.23s -> 6611.23s]  I'm in the lobby right now, extinguisher!
[6611.23s -> 6613.23s]  Will you booty me?
[6613.23s -> 6615.23s]  You know what?
[6615.23s -> 6617.23s]  You start the back out of the lobby, invite him.
[6617.23s -> 6619.23s]  What the fuck? Invite him, fight on your turf.
[6619.23s -> 6621.23s]  And fight on my turf?
[6621.23s -> 6623.23s]  I'll play on your turf.
[6623.23s -> 6625.66s]  It doesn't matter the turf.
[6625.66s -> 6627.66s]  Not a lot of friends going on here.
[6627.66s -> 6629.66s]  Right there, that's him.
[6629.66s -> 6631.66s]  Where do I go from here? Join game?
[6631.66s -> 6633.66s]  Yeah, sure, join his game, fuck it.
[6633.66s -> 6635.66s]  Hey, what do you think about that? Are we ready?
[6635.66s -> 6637.66s]  I just backed out of the game.
[6637.66s -> 6639.66s]  Who are these people?
[6639.66s -> 6641.66s]  Get out of that lobby!
[6641.66s -> 6643.66s]  Who are these people?
[6643.66s -> 6645.66s]  Invite him, invite him.
[6645.66s -> 6647.66s]  I see, I see, I'm joining your lobby.
[6647.66s -> 6649.66s]  Yeah, but I think he's in a lobby with a bunch of people.
[6649.66s -> 6651.66s]  Let's go!
[6651.66s -> 6653.66s]  Here we go.
[6653.66s -> 6655.66s]  Come on, Jarrah.
[6655.66s -> 6657.66s]  There's people in here.
[6657.66s -> 6659.66s]  Who are these people?
[6659.66s -> 6661.66s]  I think he's just in a regular lobby, he's in a free-for-all.
[6661.66s -> 6663.66s]  He's in a private lobby.
[6663.66s -> 6665.66s]  Who's in a private lobby?
[6665.66s -> 6667.66s]  How are the random people?
[6667.66s -> 6669.66s]  How do these people get in the lobby?
[6669.66s -> 6671.66s]  Moist bagel.
[6671.66s -> 6673.66s]  A friend-wisher doesn't even know how these people get in.
[6673.66s -> 6675.66s]  A friend request?
[6675.66s -> 6677.66s]  No, we're not doing that.
[6677.66s -> 6679.66s]  I need somebody from production to help me.
[6679.66s -> 6681.66s]  Oh god, it's going.
[6681.66s -> 6683.66s]  Let's see.
[6683.66s -> 6685.66s]  What happened?
[6685.66s -> 6687.66s]  You gotta set up a private body, maybe a customized one.
[6687.66s -> 6689.66s]  Invite him to your party.
[6689.66s -> 6691.66s]  It says you're in the main menu.
[6691.66s -> 6693.66s]  You're supposed to be a hacker.
[6693.66s -> 6695.66s]  And a free-for-all.
[6695.66s -> 6697.66s]  He's good at hacking, not Call of Duty.
[6697.66s -> 6699.66s]  Invite him to the party here.
[6699.66s -> 6701.66s]  It was one of you two.
[6701.66s -> 6703.66s]  I sent you in a DM.
[6703.66s -> 6705.66s]  I don't know who we did.
[6705.66s -> 6707.66s]  You are the one who's supposed to give it to production.
[6707.66s -> 6709.66s]  Let me tell you right now, don't ever ask me for a stream key in a DM.
[6709.66s -> 6711.66s]  That's actually stupid.
[6711.66s -> 6713.66s]  And I don't know why I listen to you.
[6713.66s -> 6715.66s]  Well, that's true.
[6715.66s -> 6717.66s]  It goes two ways.
[6717.66s -> 6719.66s]  We love it.
[6719.66s -> 6721.66s]  We love you.
[6721.66s -> 6723.66s]  Good news, he's in our lobby.
[6723.66s -> 6725.66s]  Good news.
[6725.66s -> 6727.66s]  Good news, everyone.
[6727.66s -> 6729.66s]  Let's win this, Turma.
[6729.66s -> 6731.66s]  I am still just thinking about how much I want to strangle you.
[6731.66s -> 6733.66s]  Right.
[6733.66s -> 6735.66s]  Well, okay.
[6735.66s -> 6737.66s]  You don't mean that.
[6737.66s -> 6739.66s]  We're trying to get a private match.
[6739.66s -> 6741.66s]  Multiplayer, create private match.
[6741.66s -> 6743.66s]  Can they answer this one question?
[6743.66s -> 6745.66s]  Classic.
[6745.66s -> 6747.66s]  He wants to ask you guys a question.
[6747.66s -> 6749.66s]  Is his face as red as his hair right now?
[6749.66s -> 6751.66s]  What's a good one? Knockout?
[6751.66s -> 6753.66s]  We want to go free-for-all.
[6753.66s -> 6755.66s]  Free-for-all.
[6755.66s -> 6757.66s]  Finally.
[6757.66s -> 6759.66s]  I mean, the hacker, seriously, I thought you could set this whole thing up.
[6759.66s -> 6761.66s]  Locked.
[6761.66s -> 6763.66s]  You've got a whole team of people.
[6763.66s -> 6765.66s]  Yeah, where's yours, by the way?
[6765.66s -> 6767.66s]  Where are all your team of friends?
[6767.66s -> 6769.66s]  Our friendship, our Christmas.
[6769.66s -> 6771.66s]  Right here.
[6771.66s -> 6773.66s]  Are we going?
[6773.66s -> 6775.66s]  Focus up, focus up, focus up.
[6775.66s -> 6777.66s]  More water, more water.
[6777.66s -> 6779.66s]  You keep spilling.
[6779.66s -> 6781.66s]  You keep aiming wrong.
[6781.66s -> 6783.66s]  Is this a good loadout?
[6783.66s -> 6785.66s]  Yeah, it's a submachine gun.
[6785.66s -> 6787.66s]  It's a run-and-gun, run-and-gun.
[6787.66s -> 6789.66s]  Keep on your toes.
[6789.66s -> 6791.66s]  Headshots or what?
[6791.66s -> 6793.66s]  You're not wearing a headset.
[6793.66s -> 6795.66s]  Headshots or what?
[6795.66s -> 6797.66s]  Hit him in the body.
[6797.66s -> 6799.66s]  Yeah, let's go.
[6799.66s -> 6801.66s]  What are you doing?
[6801.66s -> 6803.66s]  It's fine, it's fine.
[6803.66s -> 6805.66s]  Come on, Jermall, let's go.
[6805.66s -> 6807.66s]  We need the channel back.
[6807.66s -> 6809.66s]  Tighten up, tighten up.
[6809.66s -> 6811.66s]  We got PepsiCo on the phone.
[6811.66s -> 6813.66s]  We got everybody screaming at us.
[6813.66s -> 6815.66s]  There we go, that's one, Jermma.
[6815.66s -> 6817.66s]  Yeah, I can count.
[6817.66s -> 6819.66s]  Aiming a little low.
[6819.66s -> 6821.66s]  Where are you?
[6821.66s -> 6823.66s]  Keep the energy on him.
[6823.66s -> 6825.66s]  Are you camping?
[6825.66s -> 6827.66s]  He can hear you.
[6827.66s -> 6829.66s]  Because I need my fucking channel.
[6829.66s -> 6831.66s]  It's just Lane.
[6831.66s -> 6833.66s]  Are you Lane?
[6833.66s -> 6835.66s]  Now he can hear us and you fuck it up.
[6835.66s -> 6837.66s]  I see you, Jermma.
[6837.66s -> 6839.66s]  I see you.
[6839.66s -> 6841.66s]  This is really cool.
[6841.66s -> 6843.66s]  I'm not on his side.
[6843.66s -> 6847.76s]  Come on, come on.
[6847.76s -> 6850.45s]  He's made things interesting.
[6850.45s -> 6852.45s]  Focus, focus.
[6852.45s -> 6854.45s]  He's made things interesting.
[6854.45s -> 6856.45s]  Iron, but get steel, baby.
[6856.45s -> 6858.45s]  I've always said that.
[6858.45s -> 6860.45s]  Your butt looks nice in those pants.
[6860.45s -> 6862.45s]  I don't know that thing.
[6862.45s -> 6864.45s]  Is this a bad idea?
[6864.45s -> 6866.45s]  You're lying down in the middle of the same spot.
[6866.45s -> 6868.45s]  There's a lot of openings.
[6868.45s -> 6870.45s]  There's a lot of openings.
[6870.45s -> 6872.45s]  Reduce the amount of entries he could see.
[6872.45s -> 6874.45s]  This might fuck him up.
[6881.63s -> 6883.63s]  Thank you so much, Ludwig.
[6883.63s -> 6885.63s]  Are you going to lay down the whole time?
[6885.63s -> 6887.63s]  I'm not going to lay down the whole time.
[6887.63s -> 6889.63s]  Let's go ahead and pound it right there.
[6889.63s -> 6891.63s]  You're not going to lay down again?
[6891.63s -> 6893.63s]  No, not anymore.
[6893.63s -> 6895.63s]  Running gun. Head shot.
[6895.63s -> 6899.92s]  Walk around a corner.
[6899.92s -> 6901.92s]  Go around a corner?
[6901.92s -> 6903.92s]  Look at you.
[6903.92s -> 6905.92s]  I don't know where the hell he is.
[6905.92s -> 6907.92s]  You have to go around corners safely.
[6907.92s -> 6909.92s]  Ludwig, I don't think you understand
[6909.92s -> 6911.92s]  that this guy's on my channel right now.
[6911.92s -> 6913.92s]  You don't understand if you fucking lose this game
[6913.92s -> 6915.92s]  you don't get your channel back.
[6915.92s -> 6919.92s]  I'm thinking of calling the channel The Extinguisher.
[6919.92s -> 6923.92s]  Twitch is not going to let you change my name to The Extinguisher.
[6923.92s -> 6925.92s]  I'm going to change it to The Extinguisher 986.
[6925.92s -> 6927.92s]  He's actually pulling a lot of numbers.
[6927.92s -> 6929.92s]  I've actually seen his viewership.
[6929.92s -> 6931.92s]  It went up since you were off.
[6931.92s -> 6933.92s]  How many viewers does he have on that channel?
[6933.92s -> 6935.92s]  He's got like 50,000.
[6935.92s -> 6937.92s]  400 million.
[6937.92s -> 6939.92s]  How many people are actually on that channel?
[6939.92s -> 6941.92s]  He's like a 30, 40K.
[6941.92s -> 6943.92s]  He's big. I actually asked if he was through an operating room.
[6945.92s -> 6950.46s]  That's it.
[6950.46s -> 6952.46s]  It's the first of five.
[6952.46s -> 6954.46s]  You're hitting me a little hard.
[6954.46s -> 6956.46s]  It is a flaw you have.
[6956.46s -> 6958.46s]  He does it a lot.
[6958.46s -> 6960.46s]  Wow.
[6960.46s -> 6962.46s]  First of five kills.
[6962.46s -> 6964.46s]  Two rounds. Three rounds.
[6964.46s -> 6966.46s]  Tighten up. Two more kills.
[6966.46s -> 6968.46s]  Maybe reload.
[6968.46s -> 6970.46s]  What?
[6970.46s -> 6972.46s]  I thought I automatically did that.
[6972.46s -> 6974.46s]  You're still not reloaded.
[6974.46s -> 6976.46s]  What are you talking about?
[6976.46s -> 6978.46s]  I pressed R.
[6978.46s -> 6980.46s]  What are you doing?
[6980.46s -> 6982.46s]  I'm stuck.
[6982.46s -> 6984.96s]  Okay.
[6984.96s -> 6988.29s]  Hey Hacker.
[6988.29s -> 6990.29s]  Hey Extinguisher.
[6990.29s -> 6992.29s]  Are you playing with a controller?
[6994.29s -> 6996.29s]  Uh.
[6996.29s -> 7000.26s]  He's playing with a controller.
[7012.26s -> 7014.26s]  Don't do this when you're talking shit.
[7018.26s -> 7020.26s]  It's first of five.
[7020.26s -> 7022.26s]  Three to three.
[7022.26s -> 7024.26s]  Drop arm.
[7024.26s -> 7026.26s]  You know where he is.
[7026.26s -> 7028.26s]  What are you doing?
[7028.26s -> 7030.26s]  This thing sucks.
[7030.26s -> 7032.26s]  What are you doing on top of that car?
[7032.26s -> 7034.26s]  Tighten up.
[7034.26s -> 7036.26s]  Everybody quiet in the room.
[7049.23s -> 7051.66s]  Shit. I don't want to press the button.
[7051.66s -> 7054.42s]  Get away from the bus, Jerma.
[7054.42s -> 7056.42s]  What? Don't go near the bus?
[7056.42s -> 7058.42s]  Stay away from the bus.
[7058.42s -> 7060.59s]  I'm walking around the bus.
[7060.59s -> 7062.59s]  I should hide under the bus to be able to find
[7062.59s -> 7064.59s]  when he walks by, right?
[7064.59s -> 7066.59s]  You're doing it though.
[7066.59s -> 7068.59s]  You're doing it no matter what we say.
[7068.59s -> 7070.59s]  It doesn't matter.
[7070.59s -> 7072.59s]  Man, if he came from behind
[7072.59s -> 7074.59s]  the bus right now.
[7074.59s -> 7076.59s]  He would kill you.
[7076.59s -> 7078.59s]  Extinguisher.
[7078.59s -> 7081.02s]  Let's bring it home.
[7085.02s -> 7087.02s]  That went down my entire body.
[7087.02s -> 7089.02s]  I need one more kill.
[7089.02s -> 7091.02s]  That's it.
[7091.02s -> 7093.02s]  One more for the channel.
[7093.02s -> 7095.02s]  One more. Come on, baby.
[7095.02s -> 7097.02s]  Are you nervous, Extinguisher?
[7097.02s -> 7099.02s]  The extinguisher is coming for me.
[7099.02s -> 7101.02s]  Is that what you're saying?
[7101.02s -> 7103.02s]  The extinguisher is...
[7103.02s -> 7105.02s]  Oh.
[7105.02s -> 7108.29s]  You fucking idiot.
[7108.29s -> 7110.29s]  Oh.
[7110.29s -> 7113.55s]  Oh.
[7113.55s -> 7115.55s]  Look at that.
[7115.55s -> 7117.55s]  That's your channel.
[7117.55s -> 7119.55s]  That's your channel.
[7119.55s -> 7121.55s]  Best of three. It's not over yet.
[7121.55s -> 7123.55s]  It's actually my channel now, isn't it?
[7123.55s -> 7125.55s]  Oh.
[7125.55s -> 7127.55s]  Yeah, best of three.
[7127.55s -> 7129.55s]  You want two more chances?
[7129.55s -> 7131.55s]  Best of three? You said best of three.
[7131.55s -> 7133.55s]  I did say best of three. I'll give you best of three.
[7133.55s -> 7135.55s]  You said best out of three.
[7135.55s -> 7137.55s]  I did.
[7137.55s -> 7139.55s]  Are you nervous?
[7139.55s -> 7141.55s]  Look at your friends. Your friends are all
[7141.55s -> 7143.55s]  hands on faces.
[7143.55s -> 7145.55s]  They don't look like the Beach Boys anymore.
[7145.55s -> 7147.55s]  They look like the Beach Bums.
[7147.55s -> 7149.55s]  Look at them.
[7149.55s -> 7151.55s]  Go, go, go, go.
[7151.55s -> 7153.55s]  I'm ready. I'm ready.
[7153.55s -> 7156.18s]  I don't know what to do.
[7156.18s -> 7158.18s]  Go, go.
[7158.18s -> 7160.18s]  Wait, wait, wait. Back in.
[7160.18s -> 7162.18s]  You can do this.
[7162.18s -> 7164.18s]  I cannot hear anything you guys are saying, by the way.
[7164.18s -> 7166.18s]  These are noise-canceling headphones.
[7166.18s -> 7168.18s]  Look at him bring behind you.
[7168.18s -> 7170.18s]  They're worried.
[7170.18s -> 7172.18s]  I know.
[7172.18s -> 7174.18s]  Is this a good loadout?
[7174.18s -> 7176.18s]  Yeah. Good.
[7176.18s -> 7178.18s]  You think this is good? Okay.
[7178.18s -> 7180.18s]  Keep it up.
[7180.18s -> 7182.18s]  We could hit him up.
[7182.18s -> 7184.18s]  I think we could
[7184.18s -> 7186.18s]  sign him.
[7186.18s -> 7188.18s]  He's got charisma.
[7188.18s -> 7190.18s]  He's charming.
[7190.18s -> 7192.18s]  I'm walking this way.
[7192.18s -> 7194.18s]  What I like about him is he seems
[7194.18s -> 7196.18s]  like he'll stand by what he promises.
[7196.18s -> 7198.18s]  And I think that's
[7198.18s -> 7200.18s]  what a sponsor wants.
[7200.18s -> 7202.18s]  You got it, baby.
[7202.18s -> 7204.18s]  Keep it up.
[7204.18s -> 7206.18s]  What was that?
[7206.18s -> 7208.18s]  I thought you gave him the finger.
[7208.18s -> 7210.18s]  Hey, Extinguisher.
[7210.18s -> 7212.93s]  Deal with this one, bud.
[7212.93s -> 7215.94s]  Extinguisher.
[7215.94s -> 7218.50s]  Well, I like that you're calling me
[7218.50s -> 7220.50s]  Extinguisher.
[7220.50s -> 7222.50s]  Well, I don't know your name. It's the only thing you said.
[7222.50s -> 7225.18s]  You know my name.
[7225.18s -> 7227.18s]  You drained my bank account, too?
[7227.18s -> 7229.55s]  That would be nice.
[7229.55s -> 7232.05s]  Although I've heard you're $2 billion in debt.
[7232.05s -> 7234.05s]  That's fucking bullshit.
[7234.05s -> 7236.05s]  He's got host advantage, probably.
[7236.05s -> 7239.38s]  By the way,
[7239.38s -> 7242.58s]  I can hear every single thing
[7242.58s -> 7245.07s]  you guys say.
[7245.07s -> 7248.66s]  Let's go, Jerma!
[7248.66s -> 7250.66s]  Let's go, Big J!
[7250.66s -> 7252.66s]  Jerma!
[7252.66s -> 7256.18s]  Jerma!
[7256.18s -> 7258.18s]  Jerma!
[7258.18s -> 7260.42s]  Jerma!
[7260.42s -> 7262.42s]  Jerma!
[7262.42s -> 7264.42s]  Jerma!
[7264.42s -> 7266.42s]  You know, he lost someone.
[7266.42s -> 7268.42s]  You fell down.
[7268.42s -> 7270.42s]  I gotta tell you, I love shooting you
[7270.42s -> 7272.42s]  in your cute little butt.
[7272.42s -> 7274.42s]  First to five, you got it, baby.
[7274.42s -> 7276.42s]  Yeah, you are a fucking cod player, aren't you?
[7276.42s -> 7278.42s]  Press Q.
[7278.42s -> 7280.42s]  Q?
[7280.42s -> 7282.42s]  What's that?
[7282.42s -> 7284.42s]  What the hell is...
[7284.42s -> 7286.42s]  Ludwig, what the hell is that?
[7286.42s -> 7291.09s]  E?
[7291.09s -> 7293.71s]  Is this a grenade?
[7293.71s -> 7295.71s]  I think so.
[7295.71s -> 7297.71s]  You think so?
[7297.71s -> 7299.71s]  I don't know.
[7299.71s -> 7301.71s]  I just saw the bottom right.
[7301.71s -> 7303.71s]  But the icon doesn't look like a grenade.
[7303.71s -> 7305.71s]  It could be like a molotov.
[7305.71s -> 7307.71s]  Shh, I hear him!
[7307.71s -> 7316.74s]  Come into the room in the back,
[7316.74s -> 7318.74s]  near the car.
[7318.74s -> 7320.74s]  Hey, Extinguisher, if you come into the room with a guy
[7320.74s -> 7322.98s]  pointing a gun at the camera...
[7322.98s -> 7327.07s]  Son of a goddamn...
[7327.07s -> 7329.07s]  I need to get one kill!
[7331.07s -> 7333.07s]  Come on, come on, come on!
[7333.07s -> 7335.07s]  Come on, baby!
[7335.07s -> 7337.07s]  Are your palms sweaty?
[7337.07s -> 7339.07s]  No, they're actually very dry.
[7339.07s -> 7341.07s]  Thanks for asking, though.
[7341.07s -> 7343.95s]  Is it because you smudged the war paint,
[7343.95s -> 7345.95s]  do you think?
[7345.95s -> 7347.95s]  Could I reapply?
[7347.95s -> 7349.95s]  Get this, put it over there,
[7349.95s -> 7351.95s]  and don't do it again.
[7351.95s -> 7353.95s]  I'm getting fucking forward.
[7353.95s -> 7355.95s]  Come back.
[7355.95s -> 7357.95s]  Come back, season!
[7357.95s -> 7359.95s]  Holiday spirit.
[7359.95s -> 7361.95s]  That's what we need right now.
[7361.95s -> 7363.95s]  Stop touching me,
[7363.95s -> 7365.95s]  so I can focus.
[7365.95s -> 7369.22s]  I am fun!
[7369.22s -> 7371.22s]  I am fun!
[7371.22s -> 7373.22s]  This is so fun!
[7373.22s -> 7377.95s]  Oh, German.
[7377.95s -> 7379.95s]  Oh, German.
[7379.95s -> 7381.95s]  How does it kill from here, right?
[7381.95s -> 7383.95s]  German.
[7383.95s -> 7385.95s]  German.
[7385.95s -> 7387.95s]  Oh.
[7387.95s -> 7390.64s]  Oh.
[7390.64s -> 7392.64s]  Reasonable.
[7392.64s -> 7394.64s]  Welcome to my channel!
[7394.64s -> 7398.64s]  The Extinguisher 986.
[7398.64s -> 7400.64s]  Go to break, just go to the elves.
[7400.64s -> 7402.64s]  Go to the elves.
[7402.64s -> 7665.60s]  What a disaster.
[7665.60s -> 7667.60s]  Do a fun holiday show,
[7667.60s -> 7670.16s]  and at least we still have
[7670.16s -> 7672.16s]  some other stuff to do, but
[7672.16s -> 7674.98s]  it's just so frustrating
[7674.98s -> 7676.98s]  knowing that I'm sitting up there trying to
[7676.98s -> 7678.98s]  just keep it together and do the awards,
[7678.98s -> 7682.18s]  and this extinguisher,
[7682.18s -> 7684.18s]  I kind of don't know what to do.
[7684.18s -> 7686.86s]  I could have been doing more awards if I needed to,
[7686.86s -> 7689.30s]  but it's just so fucking annoying.
[7689.30s -> 7691.30s]  I'm sorry, everybody, that you're supposed to be like,
[7691.30s -> 7694.11s]  Merry Christmas, happy holidays.
[7694.11s -> 7697.82s]  What is that?
[7697.82s -> 7699.82s]  No, no, he can't do it.
[7699.82s -> 7702.13s]  No, no, no, stop that, stop that.
[7702.13s -> 7704.13s]  Can you get me into it? Pump me in, pump me in.
[7704.13s -> 7706.13s]  Does he know?
[7706.13s -> 7709.33s]  I don't think he knows.
[7709.33s -> 7715.07s]  Oh, God.
[7715.07s -> 7717.07s]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
[7717.07s -> 7719.07s]  to Bugleberry's cooking segment.
[7719.07s -> 7721.07s]  Bugleberry, you can't, can you hear me?
[7721.07s -> 7723.07s]  What?
[7723.07s -> 7725.07s]  You can't do the segment right now.
[7725.07s -> 7727.07s]  We've got a situation here.
[7727.07s -> 7729.07s]  What are you talking about?
[7729.07s -> 7731.07s]  The channel got fucking compromised.
[7731.07s -> 7733.07s]  No, no, no, I'm going to do my cooking segment,
[7733.07s -> 7735.07s]  but what are you talking about?
[7735.07s -> 7737.07s]  I'm so sorry, dude, but
[7737.07s -> 7739.07s]  everything's, we're going crazy here.
[7739.07s -> 7741.07s]  That's not fair, that's not fair.
[7741.07s -> 7743.07s]  You told me, very specifically.
[7743.07s -> 7745.07s]  I know.
[7745.07s -> 7747.07s]  You said, oh, Bugleberry,
[7747.07s -> 7749.07s]  you can have one segment this year.
[7749.07s -> 7751.07s]  Oh, okay, you can do whatever you want.
[7751.07s -> 7753.07s]  This is my one segment, and you're going to take this from me?
[7753.07s -> 7755.07s]  I don't...
[7755.07s -> 7757.07s]  Why, exactly?
[7757.07s -> 7759.07s]  I don't want to, but the channel was hacked,
[7759.07s -> 7761.07s]  and we need your help right now.
[7761.07s -> 7763.07s]  Maybe if you could make some stuff happen,
[7763.07s -> 7765.07s]  you could cast a spell on his computer or something like that.
[7765.07s -> 7767.07s]  Maybe... What did you do?
[7767.07s -> 7769.07s]  I didn't do anything. What did you do?
[7769.07s -> 7771.07s]  I didn't do anything. What website were you on?
[7771.07s -> 7773.07s]  Let's look at your history.
[7773.07s -> 7775.07s]  Oh, what are you going to do?
[7775.07s -> 7777.07s]  Oh, a pornographic website, perhaps?
[7777.07s -> 7779.07s]  No. Is that what you did?
[7779.07s -> 7781.07s]  No.
[7781.07s -> 7783.07s]  I've been here for like four days, Bugleberry, please.
[7783.07s -> 7785.07s]  What do you want me to do?
[7785.07s -> 7787.07s]  Just help.
[7787.07s -> 7789.95s]  I don't have anything here.
[7789.95s -> 7791.95s]  I don't have anything here.
[7791.95s -> 7793.95s]  I don't have any tools.
[7793.95s -> 7795.95s]  I don't have any of my spellbooks.
[7795.95s -> 7797.95s]  I came to make a holiday dinner.
[7797.95s -> 7799.95s]  Yes, I know.
[7799.95s -> 7801.95s]  You told me to leave all of my things at home.
[7801.95s -> 7803.95s]  You said, don't bring the spellbook.
[7803.95s -> 7805.95s]  You don't need it.
[7805.95s -> 7807.95s]  So it's not here. So what do you want me to do?
[7807.95s -> 7809.95s]  You're improvised.
[7809.95s -> 7811.95s]  Maybe you do... Can you do anything?
[7811.95s -> 7813.95s]  Maybe cast a spell?
[7813.95s -> 7815.95s]  I don't know what you can bring...
[7815.95s -> 7817.95s]  Bugleberry, can you please come on the show and make a turkey?
[7818.95s -> 7820.95s]  I'm sorry, dude.
[7820.95s -> 7822.95s]  I'm so sorry.
[7822.95s -> 7824.95s]  I don't have anything but time to try again.
[7824.95s -> 7826.95s]  I told you, yeah, we can make a turkey, but...
[7826.95s -> 7828.95s]  What is this for? Is this what you call a hacker?
[7828.95s -> 7830.95s]  Yes.
[7830.95s -> 7832.95s]  The channel has been compromised.
[7832.95s -> 7834.95s]  A hacker hacked the channel.
[7834.95s -> 7836.95s]  If you could do anything you can to help...
[7836.95s -> 7838.95s]  Engineers are useless, by the way.
[7838.95s -> 7840.95s]  I'm sorry, but you are.
[7840.95s -> 7843.75s]  What are you doing?
[7843.75s -> 7845.75s]  I'm going to do what I can, gentlemen.
[7845.75s -> 7847.75s]  Just hold on, hold tight.
[7847.75s -> 7849.75s]  Dude, you have no idea what this means.
[7849.75s -> 7859.66s]  I'll make it up to you, I promise.
[7859.66s -> 7861.96s]  What are you doing?
[7861.96s -> 7863.96s]  That's ketchup, Bugleberry.
[7867.22s -> 7870.68s]  What is he doing?
[7870.68s -> 7872.68s]  Cool, cool, cool.
[7872.68s -> 7875.18s]  I don't know what that is, but...
[7875.18s -> 7877.18s]  Everybody, I need you to stand back.
[7877.18s -> 7879.18s]  And that is production.
[7879.18s -> 7881.18s]  Stand back. Everybody watching, please be careful.
[7881.18s -> 7883.18s]  I don't know what could happen here.
[7883.18s -> 7885.18s]  I'm not entirely sure.
[7885.18s -> 7888.44s]  What are you going to do?
[7888.44s -> 7890.44s]  Don't do anything too weird, though.
[7890.44s -> 7893.62s]  Oh, my God.
[7893.62s -> 7896.57s]  Don't do anything too weird.
[7896.57s -> 7899.38s]  You all right?
[7899.38s -> 7905.93s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[7905.93s -> 7908.81s]  That's connected to the toilet.
[7908.81s -> 7910.81s]  That's not connected to anything.
[7910.81s -> 7912.81s]  Oh, God.
[7912.81s -> 7914.81s]  Can you feel it? Can anybody feel it?
[7914.81s -> 7917.24s]  I can. Tell them.
[7917.24s -> 7919.54s]  What?
[7919.54s -> 7921.54s]  You need to hold on to something.
[7921.54s -> 7923.54s]  All right, I'm holding on.
[7923.54s -> 7925.54s]  Oh, yes.
[7925.54s -> 7927.54s]  What is that? What is going on?
[7927.54s -> 7933.24s]  There we go.
[7933.24s -> 7936.50s]  What the fuck?
[7936.50s -> 7940.33s]  Hello.
[7940.33s -> 7942.57s]  Jesus.
[7942.57s -> 7944.57s]  No.
[7944.57s -> 7947.64s]  Put that down.
[7947.64s -> 7949.64s]  This is a sacrificial circle, Gerber.
[7949.64s -> 7951.82s]  Precisely what you wanted.
[7951.82s -> 7953.82s]  No.
[7953.82s -> 7956.57s]  What are you willing to give up?
[7956.57s -> 7958.57s]  I'm willing to hear it.
[7958.57s -> 7960.57s]  I'm nothing. I don't want to do anything.
[7960.57s -> 7962.57s]  Good shot.
[7962.57s -> 7964.57s]  Bugleberry, you could do something else, maybe.
[7964.57s -> 7966.94s]  Do something else.
[7966.94s -> 7968.94s]  What are you talking about?
[7968.94s -> 7970.94s]  Do something else. I don't want to do that.
[7970.94s -> 7972.94s]  Don't put the spell back in.
[7972.94s -> 7974.94s]  The spell is here now.
[7974.94s -> 7976.94s]  We need to sacrifice something that you care about very much.
[7976.94s -> 7978.94s]  Dude.
[7978.94s -> 7980.94s]  How about the presents under the tree?
[7980.94s -> 7982.94s]  No.
[7982.94s -> 7984.94s]  We will sacrifice something else.
[7984.94s -> 7988.94s]  Does a crew member have something that we can put in?
[7988.94s -> 7990.94s]  We're not going to sacrifice.
[7990.94s -> 7992.94s]  That's not happening.
[7992.94s -> 7994.94s]  It has to be something that you care about, Gerber.
[7994.94s -> 7996.94s]  Not something that anybody else does.
[7996.94s -> 7998.94s]  Let's go get those presents.
[7998.94s -> 8000.94s]  No.
[8000.94s -> 8002.94s]  Don't touch those presents.
[8002.94s -> 8004.94s]  It's the only way, Gerber.
[8004.94s -> 8006.94s]  Don't touch those presents. Those are my presents.
[8006.94s -> 8008.94s]  Do not touch them.
[8008.94s -> 8010.94s]  Get out of here.
[8010.94s -> 8012.94s]  No.
[8012.94s -> 8014.94s]  Please leave a couple.
[8014.94s -> 8016.94s]  This is my present.
[8016.94s -> 8018.94s]  Bugleberry, come on.
[8018.94s -> 8020.94s]  There's got to be something else you can do besides this.
[8020.94s -> 8022.94s]  Don't listen.
[8022.94s -> 8024.94s]  Don't listen to him.
[8024.94s -> 8028.01s]  Wait. Is he still there?
[8028.01s -> 8030.01s]  Bugleberry, wait. Stop.
[8030.01s -> 8032.01s]  Stop.
[8032.01s -> 8034.25s]  Can you hear me?
[8034.25s -> 8036.25s]  What the fuck, dude?
[8036.25s -> 8038.25s]  Those are mine.
[8038.25s -> 8041.13s]  I don't even know what's in those.
[8041.13s -> 8043.13s]  Pump me into him. Is he still there?
[8043.13s -> 8045.13s]  Bugleberry, can you hear me?
[8045.13s -> 8047.13s]  Don't touch.
[8047.13s -> 8049.37s]  Please leave a couple, please.
[8049.37s -> 8051.37s]  Oh, my God.
[8051.37s -> 8053.37s]  These are heavy.
[8053.37s -> 8055.37s]  I don't want to do this.
[8055.37s -> 8059.38s]  I don't want to do this.
[8059.38s -> 8061.88s]  I don't want to do this.
[8061.88s -> 8063.88s]  Anything else, please.
[8063.88s -> 8065.88s]  Anything else.
[8065.88s -> 8068.44s]  Gerber, there's no going back like I already said.
[8070.81s -> 8072.81s]  Oh, this is a new iPhone.
[8072.81s -> 8074.81s]  They get bigger every year.
[8074.81s -> 8076.81s]  Is it an iPhone?
[8076.81s -> 8078.81s]  Jesus.
[8078.81s -> 8081.56s]  Can you hear the screams?
[8081.56s -> 8083.56s]  I can. What's this one?
[8083.56s -> 8085.56s]  Oh, sounds like an Xbox.
[8085.56s -> 8087.56s]  Xbox.
[8087.56s -> 8089.56s]  Does it look like an Xbox?
[8089.56s -> 8091.56s]  That's my Xbox.
[8091.56s -> 8093.56s]  Maybe it's not.
[8093.56s -> 8095.56s]  Bugleberry, don't put that one in, maybe it's an Xbox.
[8095.56s -> 8099.45s]  Jesus.
[8101.45s -> 8103.45s]  That was juicy.
[8103.45s -> 8106.01s]  Oh, my God.
[8106.01s -> 8108.01s]  This one. Oh, a new sweater.
[8108.01s -> 8110.01s]  Is this possibly a sweater?
[8110.01s -> 8112.01s]  Is this possibly a sweater?
[8112.01s -> 8114.01s]  Oh, what size are you, Gerber?
[8114.01s -> 8116.01s]  Maybe I could wear it.
[8116.01s -> 8118.01s]  I'm a medium.
[8118.01s -> 8120.01s]  I'm going in. I'm going in there.
[8120.01s -> 8122.01s]  I'm going in.
[8122.01s -> 8124.01s]  Let me in.
[8126.01s -> 8128.01s]  Come on. Get off of me.
[8128.01s -> 8130.01s]  He must stick with it.
[8130.01s -> 8132.01s]  This is a double.
[8132.01s -> 8134.01s]  This is a DVD.
[8134.01s -> 8136.01s]  Two-part DVD.
[8136.01s -> 8138.01s]  Oh, no, this might be Final Fantasy VII
[8138.01s -> 8140.01s]  for the PlayStation 1, his favorite game.
[8140.01s -> 8142.01s]  That game sucks. I don't care.
[8142.01s -> 8144.01s]  Put that one in.
[8144.01s -> 8146.01s]  Put that one in. I don't care.
[8146.01s -> 8148.01s]  That's probably the only one I don't care about.
[8148.01s -> 8150.01s]  What's this? What's this one?
[8150.01s -> 8152.01s]  This one's making noise, Gerber.
[8152.01s -> 8154.01s]  What's in it?
[8154.01s -> 8156.01s]  You don't want me to put it in?
[8156.01s -> 8158.01s]  Don't put it in. Don't put that one in.
[8158.01s -> 8160.01s]  Leave me one present, Bugleberry, please.
[8160.01s -> 8162.01s]  One present.
[8162.01s -> 8164.01s]  Thank you. Thank God I get one.
[8164.01s -> 8167.53s]  Jesus.
[8170.98s -> 8173.48s]  How are you doing over there, Gerber?
[8173.48s -> 8175.48s]  I have no idea. I just feel sick.
[8175.48s -> 8177.48s]  I don't know.
[8177.48s -> 8179.91s]  What should I be feeling?
[8179.91s -> 8182.41s]  What are you doing?
[8186.50s -> 8192.39s]  That's two points, Gerber. Two points.
[8192.39s -> 8194.39s]  Two points, yeah. Bugleberry, I feel fucking sick.
[8196.39s -> 8198.39s]  Let's see. I don't even know what it was.
[8198.39s -> 8200.39s]  What was it?
[8200.39s -> 8202.39s]  Bugleberry, something's wrong.
[8202.39s -> 8205.34s]  How do you feel?
[8205.34s -> 8210.52s]  What the fuck was that?
[8210.52s -> 8212.52s]  Bugleberry, stop.
[8212.52s -> 8214.52s]  Stop. Stop it right. Please stop.
[8214.52s -> 8216.52s]  Oh, boy.
[8216.52s -> 8218.52s]  Hey.
[8218.52s -> 8220.95s]  I don't even know what's happening.
[8223.32s -> 8226.20s]  My chest hurts.
[8226.20s -> 8228.20s]  My chest hurts.
[8228.20s -> 8230.20s]  Is it even doing anything?
[8230.20s -> 8232.20s]  I don't think it's doing anything.
[8234.20s -> 8237.59s]  I don't think it's working.
[8237.59s -> 8240.09s]  Can you feel it, Gerber?
[8240.09s -> 8242.09s]  Can you feel it?
[8242.09s -> 8244.09s]  I don't know. I don't think so. Maybe.
[8244.09s -> 8247.66s]  What?
[8247.66s -> 8249.66s]  Nothing's happening.
[8249.66s -> 8251.96s]  What do you mean it's not enough?
[8251.96s -> 8253.96s]  I don't think it's happening.
[8253.96s -> 8255.96s]  I didn't get the channel half.
[8255.96s -> 8257.96s]  Now did I?
[8257.96s -> 8259.96s]  No.
[8259.96s -> 8261.96s]  You know what? Fine. You want power.
[8261.96s -> 8268.49s]  You want magical listeners.
[8268.49s -> 8270.49s]  I'll give it to you.
[8270.49s -> 8272.66s]  Stop.
[8272.66s -> 8274.66s]  Hello. Hello.
[8274.66s -> 8276.66s]  What's this?
[8276.66s -> 8278.66s]  A new box of chocolates.
[8278.66s -> 8280.66s]  Whatever it is, it doesn't matter.
[8280.66s -> 8282.66s]  Oh.
[8282.66s -> 8284.66s]  Oh.
[8284.66s -> 8286.66s]  Oh.
[8286.66s -> 8288.66s]  Don't ask me for anything ever again.
[8288.66s -> 8290.66s]  And by the way, if you invite somebody to a party
[8290.66s -> 8292.66s]  and you tell them to do something,
[8292.66s -> 8294.66s]  make sure it's what you actually say
[8294.66s -> 8296.66s]  and not this whole crap.
[8296.66s -> 8298.66s]  I don't want to swear, but I just...
[8298.66s -> 8300.66s]  Dude, easy on the language, please.
[8300.66s -> 8302.66s]  No, no.
[8302.66s -> 8304.66s]  I don't want to go home.
[8304.66s -> 8306.66s]  Oh, boy.
[8306.66s -> 8308.66s]  Oh, boy.
[8308.66s -> 8317.69s]  What the fuck just happened?
[8317.69s -> 8320.50s]  What happened?
[8320.50s -> 8322.94s]  What's going on?
[8322.94s -> 8326.33s]  Hey.
[8326.33s -> 8328.33s]  It's you.
[8328.33s -> 8330.33s]  It's you.
[8330.33s -> 8332.33s]  It's you, motherfucker. I see you now.
[8332.33s -> 8334.33s]  I see you.
[8334.33s -> 8336.33s]  I see you.
[8336.33s -> 8338.33s]  What do I do about this?
[8338.33s -> 8340.33s]  What do I do?
[8340.33s -> 8342.33s]  Oh, now you're scared?
[8342.33s -> 8344.33s]  That's why I had a magician.
[8344.33s -> 8346.33s]  I know a guy. You know hacking.
[8346.33s -> 8348.33s]  I got dark magic, motherfucker,
[8348.33s -> 8350.33s]  and I come for you now.
[8350.33s -> 8354.30s]  What did you do?
[8354.30s -> 8356.86s]  What is that?
[8356.86s -> 8358.86s]  I know we don't really know each other
[8358.86s -> 8360.86s]  and this is really strange.
[8360.86s -> 8362.86s]  It's really weird, everything going on,
[8362.86s -> 8364.86s]  but is your room cold right now?
[8364.86s -> 8366.86s]  It's very cold.
[8366.86s -> 8368.86s]  My nips are...
[8368.86s -> 8371.67s]  Do you have a heater here?
[8371.67s -> 8373.67s]  Yes.
[8373.67s -> 8375.67s]  I have something down here.
[8375.67s -> 8377.67s]  I don't know what this is. It's a swirling thing.
[8377.67s -> 8379.67s]  Do you have one of those in your room, dude?
[8379.67s -> 8381.67s]  Yeah, yes.
[8381.67s -> 8383.67s]  Okay.
[8383.67s -> 8385.67s]  I'll be honest.
[8385.67s -> 8387.85s]  This is kind of freaking me out.
[8387.85s -> 8389.85s]  Hopefully Bugleberry's okay.
[8389.85s -> 8391.85s]  Do we call someone?
[8391.85s -> 8393.85s]  I don't know. Hold on.
[8393.85s -> 8395.85s]  I put my hand in here.
[8395.85s -> 8397.85s]  What the...
[8397.85s -> 8400.92s]  Was that you?
[8400.92s -> 8402.92s]  Was that you?
[8402.92s -> 8404.92s]  Was that you?
[8404.92s -> 8406.92s]  I don't know.
[8406.92s -> 8408.92s]  Did it feel like someone slapped your hand?
[8408.92s -> 8410.92s]  It felt like somebody slapped my hand.
[8410.92s -> 8412.92s]  Did you touch me?
[8412.92s -> 8415.42s]  That was me.
[8415.42s -> 8417.42s]  You motherfucker!
[8417.42s -> 8419.42s]  How does that feel, huh?
[8419.42s -> 8421.42s]  Does that feel weird?
[8421.42s -> 8423.42s]  Does that feel weird?
[8423.42s -> 8427.19s]  God damn it!
[8427.19s -> 8429.94s]  You don't choke me!
[8429.94s -> 8431.94s]  All right, man. You want to fuck around?
[8431.94s -> 8433.94s]  How does this sound?
[8433.94s -> 8435.94s]  Don't you...
[8435.94s -> 8437.94s]  I'm going to kick you in the goddamn face.
[8437.94s -> 8439.94s]  How does that sound?
[8439.94s -> 8442.63s]  Let go!
[8442.63s -> 8444.63s]  Let go!
[8444.63s -> 8446.63s]  Let go!
[8446.63s -> 8448.63s]  Put it back!
[8448.63s -> 8452.15s]  What is wrong with you?
[8452.15s -> 8454.46s]  Those were nice kids, by the way.
[8454.46s -> 8456.46s]  Yeah, they are nice shoes.
[8456.46s -> 8458.46s]  I'm glad you like them. You know what?
[8458.46s -> 8461.14s]  Look at you.
[8461.14s -> 8463.14s]  My camera's all twisted.
[8463.14s -> 8465.14s]  How do you feel about this, you piece of shit?
[8465.14s -> 8467.14s]  It's a piece of wood.
[8467.14s -> 8469.14s]  Yeah, it's a piece of wood. It'll knock your fucking teeth out.
[8469.14s -> 8471.14s]  What are you going to do with a piece of wood?
[8471.14s -> 8473.14s]  I'm coming in there and I'm going to...
[8473.14s -> 8475.14s]  I'm going to knock your head off!
[8475.14s -> 8477.14s]  Hold it right there, boys.
[8477.14s -> 8479.14s]  Santa!
[8479.14s -> 8481.14s]  This has got to stop.
[8481.14s -> 8483.14s]  This is not
[8483.14s -> 8485.14s]  the Christmas spirit.
[8485.14s -> 8487.38s]  What?
[8487.38s -> 8489.38s]  Santa!
[8489.38s -> 8491.38s]  Santa!
[8491.38s -> 8493.38s]  Young man, get over here.
[8493.38s -> 8495.38s]  What do you mean?
[8495.38s -> 8497.56s]  There's a Santa here?
[8497.56s -> 8499.56s]  I mean, that's kind of funny.
[8499.56s -> 8503.02s]  There was nobody here before.
[8503.02s -> 8505.02s]  Put that stick down.
[8505.02s -> 8507.02s]  What?
[8507.02s -> 8509.02s]  I remember the last time you used that stick.
[8509.02s -> 8511.02s]  It's real.
[8511.02s -> 8513.02s]  It's him. It's really him.
[8513.02s -> 8515.02s]  That's a real Santa. That's a real Santa.
[8515.02s -> 8517.02s]  Dude, bro. This is a real Santa, I think.
[8517.02s -> 8519.02s]  We cannot have any more of this.
[8519.02s -> 8521.02s]  You're ruining Christmas with your dark magic
[8521.02s -> 8523.02s]  and your foul mouth.
[8523.02s -> 8525.02s]  I'm...
[8525.02s -> 8527.02s]  I don't know what to say, but...
[8527.02s -> 8529.02s]  I mean, the magic was...
[8529.02s -> 8531.02s]  was not with me. I hired somebody to come
[8531.02s -> 8533.02s]  and hang out. I don't know what to say.
[8533.02s -> 8535.02s]  Well, my magic-ometer
[8535.02s -> 8537.02s]  sensed it all the way from the North Pole
[8537.02s -> 8539.02s]  that something was not right in this place.
[8539.02s -> 8541.02s]  And I've come to set the
[8541.02s -> 8543.02s]  Christmas spirit right again.
[8543.02s -> 8545.02s]  Okay. Okay.
[8545.02s -> 8547.02s]  But that's going to require change
[8547.02s -> 8549.02s]  for both of your parts.
[8549.02s -> 8551.26s]  Okay.
[8551.26s -> 8553.26s]  What do you mean? What do you want us to do?
[8553.26s -> 8555.26s]  I want you to reconcile
[8555.26s -> 8557.26s]  as brothers.
[8557.26s -> 8559.26s]  I want an apology from both of you.
[8559.26s -> 8561.26s]  And we're going to start with
[8561.26s -> 8563.26s]  Extinguisher.
[8563.26s -> 8565.26s]  With me, Santa?
[8565.26s -> 8567.26s]  Yes. You get the chance to go first
[8567.26s -> 8569.26s]  to be nice
[8569.26s -> 8571.50s]  and to apologize to this little boy.
[8571.50s -> 8573.50s]  I'm out of my ground, man.
[8573.50s -> 8576.68s]  Well, when you put it like that...
[8576.68s -> 8578.68s]  I'm sorry, Jerma,
[8578.68s -> 8580.68s]  for hacking your stream
[8580.68s -> 8582.68s]  and playing the best game of Call of Duty
[8582.68s -> 8584.68s]  that I've ever put on board.
[8584.68s -> 8586.68s]  Yeah.
[8586.68s -> 8589.24s]  My bad.
[8589.24s -> 8591.42s]  Anything else?
[8591.42s -> 8594.04s]  You're not. I really do like
[8594.04s -> 8596.04s]  your butt cheeks.
[8596.04s -> 8598.04s]  There's no place for that here,
[8598.04s -> 8601.50s]  Extinguisher. Thank you.
[8601.50s -> 8603.50s]  This is a compliment, Santa, but
[8603.50s -> 8605.50s]  you're right. Well, I...
[8605.50s -> 8607.50s]  I mean, Santa...
[8607.50s -> 8609.50s]  He hacked my... He hacked my channel
[8609.50s -> 8611.50s]  and he tried to...
[8611.50s -> 8613.50s]  He wiped out my bank account
[8613.50s -> 8615.50s]  and he hacked the channel and I ruined
[8615.50s -> 8617.50s]  my Christmas show and it was really kind of annoying.
[8617.50s -> 8619.50s]  Selfishness
[8619.50s -> 8621.50s]  doesn't sound like an apology.
[8621.50s -> 8623.99s]  No, it's not.
[8623.99s -> 8625.99s]  Extinguisher, I am sorry
[8625.99s -> 8627.99s]  that I
[8627.99s -> 8629.99s]  called you a dork. I said that your
[8629.99s -> 8631.99s]  hacking abilities weren't very good. I mean,
[8631.99s -> 8633.99s]  you seem like kind of a nice guy.
[8633.99s -> 8635.99s]  And then you seem like pretty cool.
[8635.99s -> 8637.99s]  So, I'm sorry.
[8637.99s -> 8639.99s]  Really? Yeah.
[8639.99s -> 8641.99s]  Is that sincere, young man?
[8641.99s -> 8644.17s]  Yeah.
[8644.17s -> 8646.17s]  And that's... I also maybe want to say sorry
[8646.17s -> 8648.17s]  to the crew. I think I was a little
[8648.17s -> 8650.17s]  mean earlier. I've just been under
[8650.17s -> 8652.17s]  a lot of stress. And...
[8652.17s -> 8654.17s]  Stress? Stress.
[8654.17s -> 8656.17s]  And who else do you need to apologize to?
[8658.17s -> 8660.34s]  Maybe my mother, because she
[8660.34s -> 8662.34s]  thought I was going to be a doctor and I ended up being a clown
[8662.34s -> 8664.34s]  on the internet. But, I mean, still doing pretty well.
[8664.34s -> 8666.34s]  And sorry, mom.
[8666.34s -> 8668.34s]  I think that covers it.
[8668.34s -> 8670.34s]  Anyone else?
[8670.34s -> 8675.14s]  Jerma.
[8675.14s -> 8677.14s]  Oh, right. The two by four.
[8677.14s -> 8679.14s]  I'm sorry, Santa.
[8679.14s -> 8681.14s]  For... I didn't...
[8681.14s -> 8683.14s]  I didn't know. How am I supposed to know when I...
[8683.14s -> 8685.14s]  Excuses. But how am I supposed to know
[8685.14s -> 8687.14s]  that it was you? I didn't
[8687.14s -> 8689.14s]  mean to get you with that. I'm sorry.
[8689.14s -> 8691.14s]  Spit it out. I'm very sorry to
[8691.14s -> 8693.14s]  everybody. Okay. Well, that's
[8693.14s -> 8695.14s]  what I like to hear.
[8695.14s -> 8697.14s]  And Santa likes when you
[8697.14s -> 8699.14s]  make nice. Thank you.
[8699.14s -> 8701.14s]  This is very big. You're welcome.
[8701.14s -> 8703.14s]  I have a big candy cane.
[8703.14s -> 8705.14s]  And now, now that we have
[8705.14s -> 8707.14s]  reconciliation here,
[8707.14s -> 8709.14s]  I can finally grant
[8709.14s -> 8711.14s]  you your Christmas wishes.
[8711.14s -> 8713.38s]  You've been so
[8713.38s -> 8715.38s]  nice, extinguisher.
[8715.38s -> 8717.38s]  What would you like for Christmas?
[8717.38s -> 8719.38s]  Dude!
[8719.38s -> 8721.38s]  You got a Christmas wish, dude! What are you going to do?
[8721.38s -> 8723.38s]  Oh...
[8723.38s -> 8725.38s]  Oh, I got it.
[8725.38s -> 8727.56s]  Can you please,
[8727.56s -> 8729.56s]  please make me silver in League
[8729.56s -> 8731.56s]  of Legends?
[8731.56s -> 8733.56s]  It's about
[8733.56s -> 8735.56s]  time you got out of bronze. Yeah.
[8737.56s -> 8740.44s]  Did you get it? There you go.
[8740.44s -> 8742.44s]  I'm silver!
[8742.44s -> 8744.44s]  Thanks, Santa!
[8744.44s -> 8746.44s]  You're welcome, little boy.
[8746.44s -> 8748.44s]  It worked? Do you actually silver?
[8748.44s -> 8750.44s]  Yeah. Dude, that's sick.
[8750.44s -> 8752.44s]  So sick. Wow.
[8752.44s -> 8754.44s]  And now for you,
[8754.44s -> 8756.44s]  Jeremo. Money.
[8756.44s -> 8758.44s]  Oh, that's a good one. Greed. Ten million
[8758.44s -> 8760.44s]  at least.
[8760.44s -> 8762.44s]  Try again.
[8762.44s -> 8764.68s]  I wish
[8764.68s -> 8767.30s]  for the things to
[8767.30s -> 8769.30s]  kind of go back to normal. The way
[8769.30s -> 8771.30s]  they were before extinguisher
[8771.30s -> 8773.30s]  came on and hacked. I'd like
[8773.30s -> 8775.30s]  to do the rest of my awards
[8775.30s -> 8777.30s]  and just chill and have a good time.
[8777.30s -> 8779.30s]  The way things should have been, had you been nice.
[8779.30s -> 8781.93s]  That's true.
[8781.93s -> 8783.93s]  Ho, ho, ho! You're right. Santa can
[8783.93s -> 8787.32s]  do that.
[8787.32s -> 8789.32s]  Whoa!
[8789.32s -> 8791.32s]  Did it work? How do you feel?
[8791.32s -> 8793.32s]  I feel great!
[8793.32s -> 8795.32s]  Do you? It's all jiggly inside.
[8795.32s -> 8797.32s]  Hey, how about this?
[8797.32s -> 8799.32s]  I'll take you to lunch.
[8799.32s -> 8801.32s]  What? I've got at least ten
[8801.32s -> 8803.32s]  minutes on Friday if you want to hang out.
[8803.32s -> 8805.32s]  I've got fifteen minutes on Friday.
[8805.32s -> 8807.32s]  Wow.
[8807.32s -> 8809.32s]  I've got an hour on Friday.
[8809.32s -> 8811.32s]  Minimum.
[8811.32s -> 8813.32s]  That calls for a real sit down restaurant.
[8813.32s -> 8815.32s]  Do you like Ruby Tuesdays?
[8815.32s -> 8817.32s]  Yeah! Let's do it!
[8817.32s -> 8819.32s]  Alright! You and me are going to go!
[8819.32s -> 8821.32s]  It's good to see you
[8821.32s -> 8823.32s]  playing nice together again.
[8823.32s -> 8825.32s]  Thank you. Thank you.
[8825.32s -> 8827.32s]  Thank you! Bye bye!
[8827.32s -> 8829.32s]  Santa, thank you so much!
[8829.32s -> 8831.32s]  That was unbelievable!
[8831.32s -> 8833.32s]  Bye everyone! The power
[8833.32s -> 8835.32s]  of Christmas.
[8835.32s -> 8837.32s]  And the right magic. Not that dark stuff.
[8837.32s -> 8839.32s]  You can never go back to that again.
[8839.32s -> 8841.32s]  Well, I think Bugleberry might be dead.
[8841.32s -> 8843.32s]  Or he's gone. I have no idea
[8843.32s -> 8845.32s]  where he is, but
[8845.32s -> 8847.32s]  we might not see him for a long time.
[8847.32s -> 8849.32s]  And remember, the mouth speaks
[8849.32s -> 8851.32s]  out of that which fills the heart.
[8851.32s -> 8853.32s]  That's true.
[8853.32s -> 8855.32s]  So keep changing that.
[8855.32s -> 8857.32s]  And to all the community out there,
[8857.32s -> 8859.32s]  I want to remind you
[8859.32s -> 8861.32s]  that this is the season for giving
[8861.32s -> 8863.32s]  and forgiving.
[8863.32s -> 8865.32s]  And a Merry Christmas
[8865.32s -> 8867.32s]  to all!
[8867.32s -> 8869.32s]  Thank you, Santa!
[8869.32s -> 8871.32s]  Seriously!
[8871.32s -> 8873.82s]  And Extinguisher, I'm serious.
[8873.82s -> 8875.82s]  We should go hang out. I'm sorry.
[8875.82s -> 8877.82s]  It is the spirit for giving.
[8877.82s -> 8879.82s]  It is the spirit for reconciliation
[8879.82s -> 8881.82s]  and hanging out and having a good time.
[8881.82s -> 8884.95s]  Holy fucking shit!
[8884.95s -> 8886.95s]  What a disaster.
[8886.95s -> 8889.45s]  What was that?
[8889.45s -> 8891.45s]  I meant to say, Merry Christmas to all
[8891.45s -> 8893.45s]  and to all have a very
[8893.45s -> 8895.45s]  good evening and to all
[8895.45s -> 8897.45s]  good night and Merry Christmas to you.
[8897.45s -> 8899.45s]  And to all a good night!
[8903.62s -> 8911.05s]  Wow. Are we on the channel?
[8911.05s -> 8913.05s]  Are we on my channel now?
[8913.05s -> 8919.05s]  Are we good?
[8919.05s -> 8921.05s]  I'm so sorry, ladies and gentlemen,
[8921.05s -> 8923.05s]  but sometimes it takes the spirit of Christmas.
[8923.05s -> 8925.05s]  Sometimes it takes Santa Claus
[8925.05s -> 8927.05s]  to come out and right the wrongs.
[8927.05s -> 8929.54s]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are not
[8929.54s -> 8931.85s]  done. We are now
[8931.85s -> 8933.85s]  on the channel. We have control.
[8933.85s -> 8935.85s]  We're in fact just getting started.
[8935.85s -> 8937.85s]  So let's go into our
[8937.85s -> 8939.85s]  next category. This is
[8939.85s -> 8941.85s]  category number 11, by the way.
[8941.85s -> 8943.85s]  There are a lot more to do.
[8943.85s -> 8945.85s]  So, this is
[8945.85s -> 8947.85s]  Best Rant, and there's some
[8947.85s -> 8949.85s]  spillage here, and I'm gonna need
[8949.85s -> 8951.85s]  production
[8951.85s -> 8953.85s]  to maybe help me
[8953.85s -> 8955.85s]  eventually after this category.
[8955.85s -> 8957.85s]  Right? I'm not gonna say
[8957.85s -> 8959.85s]  any bad words. I'm not gonna yell
[8959.85s -> 8961.85s]  at anybody. Production,
[8961.85s -> 8963.85s]  I spilled some cocoa earlier
[8963.85s -> 8965.85s]  and
[8965.85s -> 8967.85s]  I may need a little bit of help
[8967.85s -> 8969.85s]  to clean it up. How's that sound?
[8969.85s -> 8971.85s]  There we are.
[8971.85s -> 8973.85s]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let's do this category.
[8973.85s -> 8975.85s]  This is Best Rant of the Year.
[8975.85s -> 8977.85s]  Here are your nominees. Thank you, Santa,
[8977.85s -> 8979.85s]  for fixing everything.
[8979.85s -> 8989.96s]  I get exhausted.
[8989.96s -> 8991.96s]  My brain goes like, alright, man,
[8991.96s -> 8993.96s]  that's enough. No humans are supposed to be doing this.
[8993.96s -> 8996.46s]  You know what fucking humans are supposed
[8996.46s -> 8998.46s]  to be doing? Humans are supposed to be
[8998.46s -> 9000.46s]  fucking picking up like a wheelbarrow
[9000.46s -> 9002.46s]  full of like logs
[9002.46s -> 9004.46s]  and just like slowly walking with it
[9004.46s -> 9006.46s]  and delivering those logs to the
[9006.46s -> 9008.46s]  community. And then like those logs
[9008.46s -> 9010.46s]  are used to build houses. And then there's also
[9010.46s -> 9012.46s]  like a baker and like a butcher
[9012.46s -> 9014.46s]  and humans aren't supposed to be
[9014.46s -> 9016.46s]  doing what we're doing right now. Humans aren't
[9016.46s -> 9018.46s]  supposed to be doing this. Guys, when
[9018.46s -> 9020.46s]  Ben Franklin was writing up the goddamn
[9020.46s -> 9022.46s]  fucking Declaration of Independence,
[9022.46s -> 9024.46s]  there was no guggity guggity in there.
[9024.46s -> 9026.46s]  There was no, oh yeah, we also need to make
[9026.46s -> 9028.46s]  sure to leave some room for guggity
[9028.46s -> 9030.46s]  guggity guggity guggity guggity.
[9030.46s -> 9032.46s]  There's no room for that, Ben.
[9032.46s -> 9034.46s]  Goat cheese is so gross.
[9034.46s -> 9036.46s]  Goat cheese is fucking vile.
[9036.46s -> 9038.46s]  Honest to God, I feel like everybody that eats
[9038.46s -> 9040.46s]  people pretend to like goat cheese.
[9040.46s -> 9042.46s]  You pretend to like it.
[9042.46s -> 9044.46s]  I'm so serious. I will die on this hill.
[9044.46s -> 9046.46s]  Goat cheese does not,
[9046.46s -> 9048.46s]  it tastes like dirt. Goat cheese is this
[9048.46s -> 9050.46s]  immediate, immediate
[9050.46s -> 9052.46s]  like
[9052.46s -> 9054.46s]  flavor.
[9054.46s -> 9056.46s]  It's like right when it touches your lip.
[9056.46s -> 9058.46s]  It's just like, oh, what's on this?
[9058.46s -> 9060.46s]  Goat cheese!
[9060.46s -> 9062.46s]  It's immediately, oh, goat cheese,
[9062.46s -> 9064.46s]  bro, I love it.
[9064.46s -> 9066.46s]  Oh, dude,
[9066.46s -> 9068.46s]  I'll eat a ton of it on a cracker. Of course
[9068.46s -> 9070.46s]  I will.
[9070.46s -> 9072.46s]  Yeah, right. What if
[9072.46s -> 9074.46s]  aliens don't have anything? Aliens
[9074.46s -> 9076.46s]  could just be like, oh, wow, you have
[9076.46s -> 9078.46s]  this thing over here that
[9078.46s -> 9080.46s]  keeps your food from spoiling?
[9080.46s -> 9082.76s]  Oh, on our planet,
[9082.76s -> 9084.76s]  fructose,
[9084.76s -> 9086.76s]  we have,
[9086.76s -> 9088.76s]  we got stuff.
[9088.76s -> 9090.76s]  What's that over there?
[9090.76s -> 9092.76s]  Wait, oh, it's a calendar.
[9092.76s -> 9094.76s]  What's that? You keep track of days?
[9094.76s -> 9096.76s]  Who knows, guys? The fact that you
[9096.76s -> 9098.76s]  can have sounds come out of your mouth
[9098.76s -> 9100.76s]  might be the most absurd thing that they've
[9100.76s -> 9102.76s]  ever heard. Hi, Mr. Alien.
[9102.76s -> 9104.76s]  How are you?
[9104.76s -> 9106.76s]  And their heads are going to
[9106.76s -> 9108.76s]  explode.
[9108.76s -> 9110.76s]  Exactly what I told you was going to happen. What?
[9110.76s -> 9113.96s]  What is this?
[9113.96s -> 9116.90s]  What is this?
[9116.90s -> 9118.90s]  Why does this exist? This is magic
[9118.90s -> 9120.90s]  powers.
[9120.90s -> 9122.90s]  The game's fucking easy.
[9122.90s -> 9124.90s]  It's not even a hard game. Instant kill moves are stupid.
[9124.90s -> 9126.90s]  Delete them. Patch them out of the game. Instant kill
[9126.90s -> 9128.90s]  moves are fucking stupid. Delete them from the game. Instant kill moves, you should
[9128.90s -> 9130.90s]  never have to put those in the game. They're fucking stupid.
[9130.90s -> 9132.90s]  Nobody likes them. Nobody, not one person likes them.
[9132.90s -> 9134.90s]  Your health is just too low. He doesn't have any instant kill moves.
[9134.90s -> 9136.90s]  Okay.
[9136.90s -> 9138.90s]  If I, if I chop
[9138.90s -> 9140.90s]  you up in a meat grinder, and the
[9140.90s -> 9142.90s]  only thing that comes out that's left of you is your eyeball,
[9142.90s -> 9145.40s]  you're
[9145.40s -> 9147.40s]  you're probably dead.
[9147.40s -> 9149.40s]  You're probably going to
[9149.40s -> 9151.40s]  not you, I'm just saying, like
[9151.40s -> 9153.40s]  I'm not going to put you into a meat grinder.
[9153.40s -> 9155.40s]  I'm not going to put you
[9155.40s -> 9157.40s]  into a meat grinder.
[9157.40s -> 9159.40s]  Okay, we're going to take humans out of this.
[9159.40s -> 9161.40s]  If Alien Glob
[9161.40s -> 9163.40s]  GlobGlobGlobGlob1
[9163.40s -> 9165.58s]  fucking shoots a
[9165.58s -> 9167.58s]  disintegrating ray at Alien
[9167.58s -> 9169.58s]  GlobGlobGlobGlob2
[9169.58s -> 9171.82s]  if there's only fucking teeth
[9171.82s -> 9173.82s]  left, it's, it's fucking
[9173.82s -> 9175.82s]  you're dead. You're dead.
[9175.82s -> 9177.82s]  I've run my dishwasher
[9177.82s -> 9180.31s]  because otherwise it'll get
[9180.31s -> 9182.74s]  gross. I've
[9182.74s -> 9185.11s]  washed by hand.
[9185.11s -> 9187.11s]  I don't like that idea of taking, oh yeah
[9187.11s -> 9189.11s]  there's like a bunch of fucking like saucer
[9189.11s -> 9191.11s]  and like mess on my plate
[9191.11s -> 9193.11s]  just stick it in here and turn the water on.
[9193.11s -> 9195.93s]  No. I don't like the dishwasher. I don't like it.
[9195.93s -> 9197.93s]  And you know why I also don't like the dishwasher?
[9197.93s -> 9200.17s]  All the people question marking me right now.
[9200.17s -> 9202.17s]  So you enjoy
[9202.17s -> 9204.17s]  putting like your dishes in this thing
[9204.17s -> 9206.17s]  and then like for like
[9206.17s -> 9208.17s]  at least one to two fucking
[9208.17s -> 9210.17s]  hours, you hear
[9215.29s -> 9218.74s]  it's fucking obnoxious.
[9218.74s -> 9220.74s]  It's obnoxious. And it lasts for
[9220.74s -> 9222.74s]  an hour. An hour. Two
[9222.74s -> 9224.74s]  fucking hours of this.
[9224.74s -> 9226.74s]  Twenty-three.
[9228.74s -> 9230.74s]  Isn't that a scary number? I like that number. Twenty-three?
[9230.74s -> 9232.74s]  Hold on.
[9232.74s -> 9234.74s]  Scary thriller Jim Carrey
[9234.74s -> 9236.74s]  movie, the number twenty-three
[9236.74s -> 9238.74s]  is not based on
[9238.74s -> 9240.74s]  any actual real like folklore.
[9240.74s -> 9242.74s]  I am not fucking around.
[9242.74s -> 9244.74s]  I'm telling you the absolute honest to god truth.
[9244.74s -> 9246.74s]  I've been afraid of that number since I've heard that movie
[9246.74s -> 9248.74s]  and stuff. I don't know how old was I?
[9248.74s -> 9250.74s]  When did that movie come out?
[9250.74s -> 9252.74s]  Like twenty fucking years ago?
[9252.74s -> 9254.74s]  How old was I? I was probably like
[9254.74s -> 9256.74s]  I don't know. I don't know how old I
[9256.74s -> 9258.74s]  was. I probably was very influenced.
[9258.74s -> 9260.74s]  You were twenty-three.
[9260.74s -> 9265.86s]  What? Two divided by
[9265.86s -> 9267.86s]  three is six six six. That's what
[9267.86s -> 9269.86s]  I'm saying. What do you mean question marks?
[9269.86s -> 9272.30s]  Yeah. It's
[9272.30s -> 9274.30s]  actually biblically accurate scary
[9274.30s -> 9276.30s]  number. I don't want
[9276.30s -> 9279.43s]  the afterlife to be like this. Every
[9279.43s -> 9281.43s]  time people think of the afterlife. Oh heaven.
[9281.43s -> 9283.43s]  Oh my god. I'm moving on. They're
[9283.43s -> 9285.43s]  floating as a specter.
[9285.43s -> 9288.06s]  Oh wow. Look
[9288.06s -> 9290.06s]  at it. So Elizabeth's mist everywhere. Everything's
[9290.06s -> 9292.06s]  misty and you're floating. No
[9292.06s -> 9294.06s]  I don't want it to be like this. I don't want to meet
[9294.06s -> 9296.06s]  the caveman ancestor.
[9296.06s -> 9298.42s]  They're all going to be there.
[9298.42s -> 9301.62s]  I think we all think of like oh
[9301.62s -> 9303.62s]  grandpa and grandpa
[9303.62s -> 9305.86s]  and like Uga
[9305.86s -> 9307.86s]  and Uga
[9307.86s -> 9309.86s]  Uga is going to be there.
[9309.86s -> 9311.86s]  I don't want to go to hell either because guess what?
[9311.86s -> 9314.30s]  You know there's going to be somebody there
[9314.30s -> 9316.30s]  that's going to be like yeah yeah
[9316.30s -> 9318.30s]  it's fine. Everything
[9318.30s -> 9320.30s]  man. I'm glad to be down here. It's like
[9320.30s -> 9322.30s]  I don't want to be with the one
[9322.30s -> 9324.30s]  distant great great great uncle
[9324.30s -> 9326.30s]  that went to hell and hang out with him every
[9326.30s -> 9328.30s]  day. Oh that's going to be fun.
[9328.30s -> 9330.30s]  Guys
[9330.30s -> 9332.86s]  why is there why is there not
[9332.86s -> 9335.10s]  an option?
[9335.10s -> 9337.10s]  Should I even do this? I feel like everyone's waiting
[9337.10s -> 9339.10s]  for me to do this. Okay I'll do it
[9339.10s -> 9341.10s]  in one sentence instead of like
[9341.10s -> 9343.10s]  25 sentences.
[9343.10s -> 9345.10s]  So we're going to do that in one sentence
[9345.10s -> 9347.10s]  instead of doing a 25 sentence explanation of what I
[9347.10s -> 9349.10s]  mean by this. There is no add
[9349.10s -> 9351.10s]  to cart option when you're trying to buy
[9351.10s -> 9353.10s]  shit on Origin
[9353.10s -> 9355.10s]  for the Sims. There's like a hundred things
[9355.10s -> 9357.10s]  to buy individually.
[9357.10s -> 9359.10s]  I got texted by my bank
[9359.10s -> 9361.10s]  hey we've declined purchases. There's like all these
[9361.10s -> 9363.10s]  fraudulent purchases going through the EA
[9363.10s -> 9365.10s]  store. Like no that's me.
[9365.10s -> 9367.10s]  That's me and it's dumb.
[9367.10s -> 9369.10s]  You have to go through the checkout process on each
[9369.10s -> 9371.10s]  individual. Oh
[9371.10s -> 9373.10s]  one sentence. Shit.
[9373.10s -> 9375.10s]  I'm sorry.
[9375.10s -> 9384.44s]  I tend to go off the
[9384.44s -> 9387.00s]  reels and that's not
[9387.00s -> 9389.00s]  I don't know. I just I get on a
[9389.00s -> 9391.00s]  topic and I just don't stop.
[9391.00s -> 9393.00s]  And people clip it and then they send it
[9393.00s -> 9395.00s]  away. So ladies and
[9395.00s -> 9397.37s]  gentlemen your winner
[9397.37s -> 9399.37s]  for the best rant
[9399.37s -> 9401.37s]  of 2022
[9401.37s -> 9407.19s]  is
[9407.19s -> 9410.20s]  it wasn't even close.
[9410.20s -> 9412.20s]  At 54.7 percent
[9412.20s -> 9414.20s]  55 percent
[9414.20s -> 9416.20s]  is the meat grinder.
[9416.20s -> 9418.38s]  The meat grinder and then
[9418.38s -> 9420.38s]  humans are not supposed to be doing this at 17.6
[9420.38s -> 9422.38s]  alien panic
[9422.38s -> 9424.38s]  at 9.1.
[9424.38s -> 9426.62s]  It wasn't even close.
[9426.62s -> 9429.75s]  Look at the meat. Okay.
[9429.75s -> 9431.75s]  Let me defend myself.
[9431.75s -> 9433.75s]  The meat grinder category
[9433.75s -> 9435.75s]  the meat grinder rant was
[9435.75s -> 9438.44s]  one person
[9438.44s -> 9440.44s]  said something and I was pretending
[9440.44s -> 9442.44s]  like they were
[9442.44s -> 9444.44s]  it's a made up person. Right?
[9444.44s -> 9446.44s]  This person doesn't exist. When I
[9446.44s -> 9448.44s]  say you I'm talking about
[9448.44s -> 9450.44s]  you in general. Not you
[9450.44s -> 9452.44s]  watching right now. You in general.
[9452.44s -> 9454.44s]  You in general.
[9454.44s -> 9456.44s]  It's not. Oh I'm going to put
[9456.44s -> 9458.44s]  you in a meat. No I'm not
[9458.44s -> 9460.44s]  people going to clip that too. So I'm just going to stop
[9460.44s -> 9462.44s]  talking.
[9462.44s -> 9464.74s]  When I say you I mean just you in general
[9464.74s -> 9466.74s]  just you. Oh you know
[9466.74s -> 9468.74s]  if I put you into a meat grinder I'm
[9468.74s -> 9470.74s]  not saying you individual. You get it. You
[9470.74s -> 9473.11s]  understand. Moving right along
[9473.11s -> 9475.86s]  now here come the juicy
[9475.86s -> 9479.06s]  ones. These are the juicy
[9479.06s -> 9481.50s]  ones. There's so many categories left
[9481.50s -> 9484.38s]  we just get started. I tend
[9484.38s -> 9486.55s]  to do impressions and
[9486.55s -> 9488.55s]  some of them are very good
[9488.55s -> 9490.55s]  some of them are very bad. I think some of my impressions are
[9490.55s -> 9492.55s]  good. Although people would tell
[9492.55s -> 9494.55s]  me to do your impressions your impressions are terrible.
[9494.55s -> 9496.55s]  So we'll start with
[9496.55s -> 9498.55s]  the best we'll go to the worst after. This
[9498.55s -> 9500.55s]  is the best impressions.
[9500.55s -> 9503.05s]  I think I did a pretty
[9503.05s -> 9505.93s]  good job this year. This category
[9505.93s -> 9507.93s]  I mean people are doing that emote and I can see it.
[9507.93s -> 9509.93s]  The like blah blah blah blah blah my head is bobbing
[9509.93s -> 9511.93s]  around. Whatever.
[9511.93s -> 9513.93s]  You guys know what I mean when I say that shit though
[9513.93s -> 9515.97s]  All right, you have to.
[9515.97s -> 9518.53s]  I told Santa I wouldn't swear.
[9518.53s -> 9521.70s]  So I'm gonna say, what the shoot.
[9521.70s -> 9526.78s]  So here are your nominees for best impression of the year.
[9526.78s -> 9533.54s]  These are the good ones.
[9533.54s -> 9534.86s]  At least I hope they are.
[9534.86s -> 9537.86s]  Now, make haste to the tower and defeat the evil wizards.
[9540.62s -> 9541.70s]  Mermaid man.
[9543.22s -> 9544.38s]  Evil wizards.
[9544.38s -> 9545.46s]  Evil wizards.
[9547.14s -> 9552.14s]  No, we need to get into the boat and go get them, SpongeBob.
[9554.58s -> 9557.22s]  What are you doing, you old moron?
[9557.22s -> 9562.22s]  I am trying to do what it is a superhero must be doing.
[9563.78s -> 9565.18s]  Getting to the bank.
[9566.14s -> 9570.06s]  And who could forget getting it off there?
[9570.06s -> 9576.15s]  The all-knowing, there he is.
[9576.15s -> 9581.14s]  You drink?
[9581.14s -> 9585.45s]  The orange-blue chieftain of the Badlands.
[9585.45s -> 9589.99s]  The ever-knowing gold man.
[9589.99s -> 9593.54s]  The disgusting dung eater.
[9593.54s -> 9598.54s]  And of course, there's Sir Gideon up there.
[9598.54s -> 9601.82s]  The all-knowing, what's happening, my friend?
[9601.82s -> 9603.70s]  I would have voted for that one.
[9603.70s -> 9608.70s]  Meat, potatoes, and lettuce and fucking gravy.
[9613.39s -> 9618.37s]  Spinach and radishes.
[9618.37s -> 9621.50s]  And I'm alive and I'm human.
[9621.50s -> 9624.18s]  I like to eat, too.
[9624.18s -> 9626.02s]  And I like to have children.
[9626.02s -> 9628.38s]  I'm here and I'm coming.
[9628.38s -> 9631.45s]  I'm here and I'm coming.
[9631.45s -> 9633.41s]  It's like, oh, Perry the Paratapus,
[9633.41s -> 9636.09s]  I'm going to take over the entire world, Perry.
[9636.09s -> 9637.29s]  No, it's me, Dolphins.
[9637.29s -> 9638.65s]  But that was actually really, really good
[9638.65s -> 9639.97s]  and I would say that was probably the best one
[9639.97s -> 9641.65s]  you've heard anybody do.
[9641.65s -> 9644.25s]  Not showing anything under arrest.
[9644.25s -> 9647.70s]  I'm underwater?
[9647.70s -> 9652.70s]  Gentlemen, this is tobacco receive manifest.
[9653.54s -> 9654.38s]  Ever.
[9654.38s -> 9656.70s]  Look at that headlock there, see?
[9656.70s -> 9658.38s]  That chap over there joined.
[9658.38s -> 9662.06s]  Or by pay us this, is the local got me on the penis.
[9662.06s -> 9662.90s]  Before.
[9662.90s -> 9663.86s]  That's one voice.
[9663.86s -> 9665.70s]  Who's a pretty bird?
[9668.67s -> 9676.44s]  Who's a pretty bird?
[9676.44s -> 9678.20s]  Who wants a kiss?
[9678.20s -> 9679.52s]  Who wants a kiss?
[9681.24s -> 9682.44s]  Tom Scott.
[9682.44s -> 9683.96s]  This water is electrified.
[9684.96s -> 9688.50s]  It will kill you if you stand within five feet of it.
[9688.50s -> 9695.42s]  Meow, meow, oh, Bowser.
[9695.42s -> 9696.46s]  Ah, annoying.
[9696.46s -> 9701.56s]  Oh, boys and girls, it's a me, Mario.
[9701.56s -> 9703.50s]  Let me tell you something.
[9703.50s -> 9708.50s]  If somebody want to tell you to take drugs, always say no.
[9708.70s -> 9712.98s]  You see, Luigi tried to drink and do drugs one time
[9712.98s -> 9714.50s]  and I said, no.
[9714.50s -> 9715.74s]  And he said, Mario.
[9715.74s -> 9717.46s]  And I said, no.
[9718.22s -> 9719.78s]  Fucking God damn it.
[9727.30s -> 9731.22s]  And that's the bottom line, because Stone Cold said so.
[9731.22s -> 9732.54s]  Pretty good.
[9732.54s -> 9734.10s]  They're eating her.
[9734.10s -> 9736.95s]  And then they're going to eat me.
[9736.95s -> 9741.31s]  Oh my God.
[9741.31s -> 9744.55s]  Please, can you do a quick Seinfeld routine
[9744.55s -> 9749.36s]  about the word vast?
[9749.36s -> 9750.20s]  What even is vast?
[9750.20s -> 9751.04s]  What's that supposed to mean?
[9751.04s -> 9752.32s]  Vast.
[9752.32s -> 9753.32s]  Just say big.
[9753.32s -> 9754.56s]  Just say large.
[9754.56s -> 9757.46s]  Say big.
[9757.46s -> 9758.94s]  Why do we need names for so,
[9758.94s -> 9760.46s]  why do we have so many names to describe
[9760.46s -> 9761.98s]  what is effectively big?
[9769.04s -> 9774.65s]  I mean, if you want my vote, I'm voting for Alex Jones.
[9774.65s -> 9775.73s]  I don't think anybody does it.
[9775.73s -> 9777.33s]  Alex Jones, like, I can't.
[9777.33s -> 9780.20s]  I just, I gotta be really honest.
[9780.20s -> 9784.56s]  Find me somebody that can do that as good as I can.
[9784.56s -> 9786.16s]  People usually, you know, they go like this.
[9786.16s -> 9787.32s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[9787.32s -> 9790.31s]  Find me somebody that can do that better than me.
[9790.31s -> 9791.95s]  I don't think you can.
[9791.95s -> 9795.30s]  That's my vote, that's what I voted for.
[9796.10s -> 9799.52s]  But your winner of the best impression of the year is,
[9803.50s -> 9806.74s]  of course, it's Alpenny the Platypus, Doof and Schmertz.
[9806.74s -> 9809.86s]  With 30% of the vote, that's a high one,
[9809.86s -> 9812.44s]  then Alex Jones right behind it.
[9812.44s -> 9815.12s]  16.8, not right behind it, pretty far.
[9816.40s -> 9818.76s]  Doof and Schmertz, Alex Jones, Doof and Schmertz.
[9818.76s -> 9820.12s]  It's a hard word to say.
[9820.12s -> 9825.12s]  And then democracy manifests subtitles at 12.3%.
[9827.84s -> 9830.73s]  Doof and Schmertz takes it.
[9830.77s -> 9832.01s]  I think I can do a pretty good job.
[9832.01s -> 9837.89s]  And now, obviously, I do a lot of these every year.
[9839.44s -> 9842.68s]  And we're not just gonna talk about the good ones.
[9842.68s -> 9845.24s]  We're gonna talk about the bad ones.
[9845.24s -> 9848.98s]  This is the worst impression of the year.
[9848.98s -> 9852.38s]  I don't agree with some of these.
[9852.38s -> 9853.70s]  Let's be real.
[9853.70s -> 9855.62s]  I don't agree with some of these.
[9855.62s -> 9858.42s]  Some of these are a little, I don't like that character,
[9858.42s -> 9860.02s]  so I'm just gonna nominate it.
[9860.02s -> 9862.63s]  That's not how this works.
[9862.63s -> 9865.27s]  But just like the bad ones, they're also good ones,
[9865.27s -> 9867.14s]  and what you just saw.
[9867.14s -> 9868.38s]  Here are your nominees
[9868.38s -> 9870.58s]  for the worst impression of the entire year.
[9879.32s -> 9880.76s]  Did you do Jack Sparrow?
[9880.76s -> 9882.12s]  I don't know what that sounds like.
[9882.12s -> 9884.16s]  Fuck, I'm done.
[9884.16s -> 9885.12s]  But my career is over.
[9885.12s -> 9886.28s]  I'm ending my career.
[9886.28s -> 9887.36s]  It's over today.
[9887.36s -> 9889.74s]  Okay, so I got a letter.
[9889.74s -> 9892.34s]  Jerry, when you read this letter,
[9892.34s -> 9894.94s]  I will already be on the other side of the world.
[9894.94s -> 9896.38s]  I'm sorry about that.
[9896.38s -> 9899.02s]  I'm sorry that I'm not the father you wanted me to be.
[9899.02s -> 9900.82s]  The rest is up to you.
[9900.82s -> 9903.30s]  Do your best and live a wonderful life.
[9903.30s -> 9904.26s]  You always will.
[9906.34s -> 9907.90s]  That's the worst George I've ever heard.
[9907.90s -> 9908.74s]  It's really not.
[9908.74s -> 9909.74s]  That's what I mean.
[9909.74s -> 9911.74s]  It's Gilbert Coffrey.
[9911.74s -> 9915.18s]  Hey, when I'm told I've been looking forward
[9915.18s -> 9917.50s]  to this for quite a long time.
[9917.50s -> 9920.22s]  Alpha's more popular than ever in the Mushroom Kingdom.
[9920.22s -> 9922.34s]  Wasn't that tourney yesterday incredible?
[9924.21s -> 9926.37s]  But if we want to keep the sport interesting,
[9926.37s -> 9928.17s]  we need some green players, you see.
[9929.99s -> 9932.91s]  Man, just show me folks who can hit the green.
[9932.91s -> 9934.23s]  Oh, whoa, wait.
[9934.23s -> 9935.07s]  That's not even that bad.
[9935.07s -> 9935.91s]  It really isn't. That's crazy.
[9935.91s -> 9938.07s]  That's all I had to do was like just clear my throat.
[9938.07s -> 9944.13s]  We need some fresh faces on the leaderboard.
[9944.13s -> 9945.97s]  Okay.
[9945.97s -> 9949.70s]  That was bad. That was a really bad.
[9949.70s -> 9952.26s]  I don't know if that was Toad or,
[9952.26s -> 9953.26s]  I don't know what game that was from,
[9953.26s -> 9954.66s]  but it was a bad impression.
[9956.54s -> 9961.54s]  Ooh, Skywalker, I must say, are you, are you?
[9961.90s -> 9963.34s]  Is that bad?
[9963.34s -> 9965.70s]  It really was one word elongated.
[9965.70s -> 9966.54s]  Wow.
[9968.54s -> 9970.66s]  You sound like the sweetest chef.
[9970.66s -> 9972.02s]  You have a Bobby Hill impression?
[9972.02s -> 9972.86s]  I'll try.
[9973.86s -> 9975.62s]  Yeah.
[9975.62s -> 9977.14s]  Hey, Dad, I'm sorry.
[9977.14s -> 9979.42s]  I can't, but I tried.
[9979.42s -> 9983.16s]  What does Cookie Monster sound like?
[9983.16s -> 9984.84s]  It's like, what does it sound like?
[9984.84s -> 9985.76s]  It's kind of like.
[9991.90s -> 9993.54s]  Cookies.
[9993.54s -> 9995.10s]  I love cookies, right?
[9995.10s -> 9996.22s]  Something like that.
[9996.22s -> 9997.06s]  Let me try it.
[9997.06s -> 10001.30s]  Let me go all in with it and see what happens.
[10001.30s -> 10003.46s]  This cookie is delicious.
[10003.46s -> 10004.86s]  I love cookies.
[10004.86s -> 10005.70s]  Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
[10005.70s -> 10006.66s]  There's the heavy from TF2.
[10006.66s -> 10007.70s]  Oh, yes, cookies.
[10007.70s -> 10009.74s]  That's not, that's not really, really not that good.
[10009.74s -> 10012.46s]  But I mean, it's, how do you even do it?
[10012.46s -> 10014.28s]  Let me try to do a dog.
[10014.28s -> 10017.68s]  Oh, Morty, we gotta be careful.
[10017.68s -> 10019.69s]  Put that back in there and we're gonna go back,
[10019.69s -> 10020.89s]  back in time to shave.
[10020.89s -> 10021.93s]  Actually, it is different.
[10021.93s -> 10026.60s]  Morty, Morty, we gotta be careful.
[10026.60s -> 10027.76s]  Guys, I've never seen all these movies.
[10027.76s -> 10028.64s]  I've never seen them.
[10028.64s -> 10029.96s]  I just know, I know Christopher Lloyd,
[10029.96s -> 10034.10s]  Christopher Lloyd, right?
[10034.10s -> 10035.54s]  His name's Morty, not Marty.
[10035.54s -> 10037.38s]  Marty, not, what?
[10037.38s -> 10038.90s]  Oh, I just dropped everything.
[10038.90s -> 10040.66s]  Do a Taz impression.
[10040.66s -> 10043.93s]  No, no, no, sponsor stream.
[10043.93s -> 10045.41s]  Ah, whatever, why not?
[10058.94s -> 10062.31s]  I was just about, okay, that Taz,
[10062.31s -> 10064.79s]  Taz Mania was just about to do that.
[10064.79s -> 10066.47s]  Somebody like hitman style,
[10066.47s -> 10071.59s]  like put a fucking piano wire on his neck.
[10071.67s -> 10074.46s]  Patrick?
[10074.46s -> 10077.95s]  Hey, SpongeBob, it's me, Patrick.
[10077.95s -> 10081.39s]  Oh yeah, SpongeBob, let's go have an adventure.
[10081.39s -> 10082.83s]  What was wrong with this one?
[10082.83s -> 10083.91s]  Does that sound like him, kind of?
[10083.91s -> 10084.75s]  Yeah, it does.
[10084.75s -> 10085.59s]  Why was it on here?
[10088.34s -> 10089.74s]  Enjoy yourself.
[10089.74s -> 10090.58s]  No.
[10091.76s -> 10093.96s]  It's this wide, strange world.
[10094.84s -> 10098.12s]  This realm has a way of getting right in the end.
[10098.12s -> 10098.96s]  What?
[10100.80s -> 10102.32s]  Okay, this one sucks.
[10102.32s -> 10103.28s]  This one sucks.
[10103.28s -> 10104.12s]  I like it.
[10104.12s -> 10104.96s]  This is bad.
[10105.56s -> 10108.40s]  I will be expecting many great things from you.
[10109.72s -> 10114.72s]  It will get hotter in ways you might not be able to imagine.
[10115.16s -> 10116.52s]  Geez, this one's the worst.
[10116.52s -> 10118.98s]  Does this win?
[10118.98s -> 10120.34s]  Voice is bad, voice is bad.
[10120.34s -> 10121.58s]  Shitty voice, worst voice.
[10121.58s -> 10122.42s]  Does that win?
[10128.66s -> 10131.83s]  You want my vote, it's that one.
[10131.83s -> 10136.98s]  Look, okay, you have to, I am live.
[10136.98s -> 10139.38s]  I don't know how many hours a year,
[10139.38s -> 10141.54s]  but if I'm gonna do an impression,
[10141.54s -> 10144.54s]  sometimes you get shitty ones, sometimes you get duds.
[10144.54s -> 10146.30s]  I don't think the George was bad.
[10147.99s -> 10150.63s]  Why that George Costanza was so bad, Jerry.
[10150.63s -> 10151.63s]  How?
[10151.63s -> 10154.39s]  Why would that be nominated that many times?
[10154.39s -> 10157.48s]  I think that one was fine.
[10157.48s -> 10159.24s]  Why was that so bad?
[10159.24s -> 10161.56s]  Question marks, that sucked.
[10161.56s -> 10162.92s]  Was it that bad?
[10162.92s -> 10163.84s]  I don't think it was.
[10163.84s -> 10166.98s]  I think you're mistaken here.
[10166.98s -> 10167.82s]  They were all bad.
[10167.82s -> 10168.90s]  The frog one definitely won.
[10168.90s -> 10170.02s]  If it didn't, then there's something wrong
[10170.02s -> 10171.26s]  with this community.
[10171.26s -> 10173.90s]  Ladies and gentlemen, your winner of Worst Impression
[10174.54s -> 10178.34s]  of the entire year is, what the fuck?
[10179.22s -> 10182.06s]  It's not even in the top three.
[10182.06s -> 10187.04s]  Toad was 23.2% of the vote.
[10187.04s -> 10189.84s]  And then Jack Sparrow at 18.9,
[10189.84s -> 10195.66s]  and then Patrick Starr at 10.9%, one, two, and three.
[10195.98s -> 10198.94s]  What?
[10198.94s -> 10200.42s]  That frog was so bad.
[10200.42s -> 10204.93s]  How was that not at like 80% of the vote?
[10204.93s -> 10210.41s]  All right, time for the meaty categories.
[10210.41s -> 10213.75s]  These are the ones that are full of flavor.
[10213.75s -> 10215.75s]  I'm gonna take my time with these because I,
[10215.75s -> 10218.69s]  this is my ego stroke here.
[10218.69s -> 10224.38s]  It's time for an ego stroke until this one, but you know.
[10224.42s -> 10227.86s]  This next category is one that hits very deep to me,
[10227.86s -> 10230.42s]  and probably to those of you watching.
[10230.42s -> 10232.78s]  This is for the best joke
[10232.78s -> 10235.42s]  taking more than five minutes to set up.
[10235.42s -> 10238.62s]  And what that means is that anything that took
[10238.62s -> 10242.34s]  at least a few minutes to get rolling, okay?
[10242.74s -> 10244.86s]  At least a few minutes to get rolling.
[10244.86s -> 10246.74s]  So there were a lot of nominees,
[10246.74s -> 10249.78s]  a lot of good ones that I think, and you're swearing.
[10249.78s -> 10252.50s]  Santa is already across the globe right now.
[10252.50s -> 10255.98s]  He's a very busy person, so it'll be a very busy man.
[10255.98s -> 10259.76s]  Ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees
[10259.76s -> 10262.08s]  for the best joke of the year
[10262.08s -> 10266.32s]  taking more than five minutes to set up.
[10266.32s -> 10272.25s]  Toad wasn't even bad, stop.
[10272.25s -> 10274.29s]  I think that would add some atmosphere
[10274.29s -> 10276.49s]  if like after every major kind of area,
[10276.49s -> 10278.13s]  and every puzzle was like music played,
[10278.13s -> 10279.41s]  and you just heard.
[10279.41s -> 10281.29s]  Scorn.
[10281.29s -> 10282.73s]  Have a kind of cool leg.
[10282.73s -> 10283.77s]  Jesus.
[10283.77s -> 10286.21s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[10286.21s -> 10287.65s]  Scorn.
[10287.65s -> 10289.45s]  Blood.
[10289.45s -> 10291.09s]  Lots of fucking blood.
[10291.09s -> 10292.33s]  Lots of blood.
[10292.33s -> 10293.97s]  That's a lot of blood.
[10293.97s -> 10295.91s]  Scorn.
[10295.91s -> 10298.64s]  I have to be better at fucking acting.
[10298.64s -> 10302.41s]  True.
[10302.41s -> 10303.25s]  Scorn.
[10305.14s -> 10313.10s]  I'm sorry, I can't do it.
[10313.10s -> 10315.95s]  Scorn.
[10315.95s -> 10317.95s]  I look like a different person.
[10317.95s -> 10320.15s]  Leave it on so the Twitch thumbnail gets it.
[10321.26s -> 10322.30s]  All right, fine.
[10322.30s -> 10323.94s]  Make this the thumbnail.
[10323.94s -> 10328.54s]  No, dude, I...
[10328.54s -> 10329.66s]  It's so fucked up.
[10329.66s -> 10331.54s]  This is fucking insane.
[10331.54s -> 10333.54s]  I think we're going a little too far.
[10333.54s -> 10334.86s]  I think we're going too far.
[10334.86s -> 10336.50s]  Okay, are you ready for the culmination
[10336.50s -> 10339.42s]  of what is the thumbnail right now?
[10339.42s -> 10341.66s]  Here you go.
[10341.66s -> 10347.38s]  Welcome to hell.
[10347.38s -> 10348.38s]  Now listen, buster.
[10350.58s -> 10352.79s]  Once we get down here,
[10352.79s -> 10354.71s]  I'm gonna make sure that we take care of this
[10354.71s -> 10357.20s]  as soon as possible.
[10357.20s -> 10360.48s]  Now, I don't get that move at all.
[10360.52s -> 10363.60s]  That move is absolutely unbelievable.
[10363.60s -> 10365.56s]  It's one of those moves that you can't do anything about.
[10365.56s -> 10368.08s]  And I'm telling you, yeah.
[10368.08s -> 10370.82s]  But you know what else ridiculous is that?
[10370.82s -> 10371.66s]  Playing soon.
[10371.66s -> 10375.03s]  They're gonna be like, I can fly eventually too.
[10375.03s -> 10377.51s]  How many fucking moves do you get before you...
[10377.51s -> 10378.51s]  I'm sorry about that, folks,
[10378.51s -> 10379.95s]  but what I meant to say was,
[10379.95s -> 10381.39s]  how many moves do you get to do in a row
[10381.39s -> 10383.95s]  before gosh darn it, you...
[10383.95s -> 10385.55s]  How many moves do you get to do gosh darn it
[10385.55s -> 10387.39s]  before fucking wrong thing?
[10387.39s -> 10388.51s]  Wrong thing.
[10388.51s -> 10391.32s]  All right, here we go.
[10391.32s -> 10392.28s]  I made the medic.
[10392.28s -> 10393.24s]  I'm good to go.
[10404.08s -> 10406.08s]  Do I need to be killing these people?
[10418.44s -> 10419.48s]  I'm not eating bugs.
[10419.48s -> 10423.76s]  I wouldn't eat bugs if my mother asked me to.
[10423.76s -> 10425.12s]  What about a doctor?
[10425.12s -> 10428.54s]  I don't know, what does the doctor look like?
[10428.54s -> 10433.54s]  Is he six feet tall, 200, lean cut?
[10434.50s -> 10435.34s]  What does he look like?
[10435.34s -> 10438.30s]  And he's so fit, he just got done cycling
[10438.30s -> 10441.34s]  and he's got cycling shorts on and a lab coat.
[10441.82s -> 10443.90s]  Stop sharing your fantasy.
[10445.98s -> 10449.62s]  Just got done with a quick bike ride.
[10449.62s -> 10452.78s]  Kickstand, comes in, just like sweat,
[10452.78s -> 10454.38s]  just glistening off his forehead.
[10456.18s -> 10458.64s]  So, what brings you in today?
[10458.64s -> 10460.28s]  And I'm like, oh wow, look at that,
[10460.28s -> 10463.20s]  crazy, that's why you got that, what a head of hair.
[10463.20s -> 10471.38s]  Yeah, haven't had a headache, by the way, in a long time.
[10471.38s -> 10476.37s]  Different music.
[10476.37s -> 10479.22s]  You wanna eat some bugs?
[10479.22s -> 10480.58s]  We're watching you in a bar, German,
[10480.62s -> 10482.77s]  you wanna do something wacky?
[10482.77s -> 10485.88s]  I like this one.
[10485.88s -> 10490.41s]  Hey, this one goes out to all y'all in the bar.
[10490.41s -> 10498.10s]  Hey, three, two, one, let's go.
[10498.10s -> 10500.81s]  Mm, green tea.
[10500.81s -> 10503.13s]  They can't even hear me.
[10503.13s -> 10504.41s]  Should I try to communicate?
[10504.41s -> 10508.82s]  Hey, you, wait, look.
[10508.82s -> 10512.09s]  Hey, everybody, hey.
[10512.09s -> 10514.41s]  I was on screen at a bar, for those back there
[10514.41s -> 10515.81s]  that don't know what's going on.
[10517.66s -> 10520.93s]  I was typing and shit.
[10520.93s -> 10522.41s]  Yeah!
[10522.41s -> 10526.84s]  What about a Twitch moment badge for longest stream?
[10526.84s -> 10528.08s]  Wait, can I do that?
[10528.08s -> 10531.16s]  You were here for the longest stream
[10531.16s -> 10533.28s]  I've ever done on this channel.
[10533.28s -> 10538.67s]  13 hours, 19 minutes, and 41 seconds.
[10538.67s -> 10539.95s]  Ain't ever gonna happen again.
[10539.95s -> 10541.03s]  Should I do another moment?
[10541.03s -> 10542.03s]  It's not, ever.
[10546.91s -> 10548.99s]  Like the 200 people that just left?
[10548.99s -> 10550.03s]  You fucked up.
[10550.03s -> 10554.19s]  13 hours, 27 minutes, and six seconds.
[10554.19s -> 10556.71s]  I think that deserves a quick bite of pizza.
[10559.10s -> 10562.17s]  Hey, man, I can't believe you made it.
[10562.17s -> 10563.01s]  Was I on drugs?
[10563.01s -> 10563.85s]  Like, what was I doing here?
[10563.85s -> 10567.25s]  13 hours, 36 minutes, and 52 seconds.
[10567.25s -> 10568.57s]  God, man, I can't believe.
[10568.57s -> 10569.41s]  You were here.
[10569.41s -> 10579.19s]  Don't ever call the sus guy at 3 a.m.
[10579.19s -> 10580.11s]  Hey, dude, can you speak up?
[10580.11s -> 10582.74s]  I'm in a construction site.
[10582.74s -> 10584.10s]  I would vote for this one.
[10584.10s -> 10584.94s]  I love this one.
[10589.32s -> 10590.16s]  Okay, hold on.
[10595.48s -> 10597.46s]  Why would you even go live?
[10597.46s -> 10598.42s]  Just wait till tomorrow.
[10598.98s -> 10599.82s]  Like, who cares?
[10599.82s -> 10623.06s]  Fucking keep your stream off.
[10623.06s -> 10623.90s]  Okay.
[10626.93s -> 10629.01s]  What the fuck?
[10629.01s -> 10630.89s]  What am I supposed to do?
[10630.89s -> 10632.97s]  Guys, what does that mean?
[10632.97s -> 10636.66s]  Whoa, a guy.
[10636.66s -> 10637.50s]  Hold on, watch out.
[10637.50s -> 10641.94s]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[10641.94s -> 10643.34s]  I gotta get this kill.
[10643.34s -> 10645.82s]  Gotta get this kill, gotta get this kill.
[10645.82s -> 10647.58s]  Oh, I died.
[10649.65s -> 10650.65s]  Shoot.
[10650.65s -> 10651.49s]  What if I just like,
[10651.49s -> 10652.93s]  ready to fall asleep on stream?
[10653.77s -> 10657.61s]  All right, I'm gonna pretend to fall asleep on stream.
[10657.61s -> 10659.45s]  I think this is in both categories, by the way.
[10659.45s -> 10660.85s]  Dude, wicked fucking tired.
[10660.85s -> 10662.65s]  Like, had a long day.
[10662.65s -> 10663.69s]  I hope it wins both.
[10665.01s -> 10667.13s]  And then you're woken up by the jump scare.
[10667.13s -> 10670.77s]  It might be a good idea to make sure
[10670.77s -> 10673.84s]  everyone's in a proper place.
[10673.84s -> 10680.38s]  Interestingly enough, you guys made it really awesome.
[10680.38s -> 10686.35s]  Fuck.
[10686.35s -> 10688.43s]  Yeah, yeah.
[10688.43s -> 10690.07s]  So, speaking of which.
[10690.07s -> 10690.91s]  Such a bad payoff.
[10690.91s -> 10691.87s]  I am a new man.
[10691.87s -> 10694.11s]  I'm here to do something that I said
[10694.27s -> 10697.79s]  I would never do, and that's to play Destiny 2.
[10697.79s -> 10698.63s]  I love this part where he says the doctor.
[10698.63s -> 10700.59s]  I know, I said I'd never do it.
[10700.59s -> 10701.59s]  But here we are.
[10701.59s -> 10702.55s]  Shpee.
[10704.33s -> 10705.65s]  That's the Shpee Ship.
[10706.57s -> 10709.09s]  We're taking the Shpee Ship to war.
[10709.09s -> 10712.77s]  You're, you're, you took everything from me,
[10712.77s -> 10715.29s]  even though it's really actually not that bad of a character.
[10715.29s -> 10718.17s]  And I'm gonna, I'm gonna haunt you for the rest of your life.
[10718.17s -> 10720.05s]  You better run, and you better never,
[10720.05s -> 10721.33s]  you better never look back.
[10721.33s -> 10722.73s]  Is this Scooby-Doo Van?
[10723.57s -> 10726.69s]  Is this the mystery machine?
[10737.16s -> 10738.16s]  It's too dark.
[10763.14s -> 10767.76s]  Well, that was quite a year.
[10767.76s -> 10772.76s]  Those are your top jokes voted by you, nominated by you.
[10774.14s -> 10774.98s]  Let's find out.
[10774.98s -> 10776.94s]  Sorry, I just punched you.
[10776.94s -> 10778.90s]  Can I get some of this off my face too?
[10778.90s -> 10781.05s]  This is gonna be permanent.
[10781.05s -> 10781.89s]  I just did it again.
[10781.89s -> 10785.18s]  What the hell am I doing?
[10785.18s -> 10788.42s]  Ladies and gentlemen, the best joke of the year.
[10788.42s -> 10791.46s]  Taking more than five minutes to set up is,
[10793.60s -> 10797.74s]  oh, it's an upset.
[10797.74s -> 10799.54s]  It's an upset.
[10799.54s -> 10803.08s]  This is an upset.
[10803.08s -> 10808.08s]  With 25% of the vote, 25%, the ultimate thumbnail.
[10812.11s -> 10814.27s]  The huge thumbnail wins.
[10814.27s -> 10819.96s]  And then scorn, far away at 12.6% of the vote, far away.
[10822.31s -> 10824.55s]  And then sleeping to five nights at Freddy's
[10824.55s -> 10827.25s]  with 10% of the vote.
[10827.25s -> 10828.25s]  That's kind of an upset.
[10828.25s -> 10831.66s]  I thought that scorn, all the scorners in the chat here,
[10831.66s -> 10835.46s]  probably gonna be pretty upset about that.
[10835.46s -> 10836.90s]  Well, we did the good one.
[10838.64s -> 10840.24s]  So why don't we do the bad one?
[10841.90s -> 10844.66s]  If you think that I nail it every time, you're wrong.
[10846.84s -> 10850.46s]  I have a tendency to, there's a couple of duds every year.
[10850.46s -> 10853.70s]  A couple of duds, not every joke is funny.
[10853.70s -> 10855.26s]  I don't expect them to be.
[10855.26s -> 10856.46s]  But how do you know if something's gonna be funny
[10856.46s -> 10858.76s]  if you don't do it?
[10858.80s -> 10861.04s]  Ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees
[10861.04s -> 10864.00s]  for the worst joke of the year.
[10864.00s -> 10865.52s]  Taking five minutes to set up.
[10874.18s -> 10875.02s]  What if I just like,
[10875.02s -> 10876.66s]  pretended to fall asleep on stream?
[10876.66s -> 10879.34s]  That's right, there it is.
[10879.34s -> 10881.10s]  All right, I'm gonna pretend to fall asleep on stream.
[10881.10s -> 10882.62s]  I'm gonna put a text on the bottom that says like,
[10882.62s -> 10884.38s]  dude, wicked fucking tired.
[10884.38s -> 10885.42s]  Like, had a long day.
[10888.53s -> 10890.53s]  And then you're woken up by the jump scare.
[10890.53s -> 10894.74s]  It might be a good one,
[10894.74s -> 10903.90s]  but it's probably great to get interestingly enough.
[10903.90s -> 10909.85s]  Fuck.
[10909.85s -> 10911.27s]  Yeah.
[10912.15s -> 10913.67s]  I don't know how I got in this Discord call,
[10913.67s -> 10914.79s]  but I need somebody to help.
[10914.79s -> 10917.51s]  I got the wrong server ID, I think.
[10917.51s -> 10919.03s]  I don't know how I got in this Discord call,
[10919.03s -> 10920.15s]  but I need somebody to help.
[10920.15s -> 10922.15s]  I got the wrong server ID, I think.
[10923.71s -> 10924.55s]  Did you click spectate?
[10924.55s -> 10925.39s]  It's on the bottom left.
[10925.39s -> 10926.83s]  No, I clicked a goddamn arrow.
[10926.83s -> 10927.67s]  Where is it?
[10927.67s -> 10929.75s]  I don't know how I got in this Discord call,
[10929.75s -> 10930.87s]  but I need somebody to help.
[10930.87s -> 10932.87s]  I got the wrong server ID, I think.
[10932.87s -> 10934.27s]  What the fuck is that?
[10934.27s -> 10935.67s]  I'm gonna have to go, I think.
[10935.67s -> 10937.75s]  Guys, I think I got in the wrong Discord call.
[10937.75s -> 10938.71s]  I don't know how I got in here.
[10938.71s -> 10939.79s]  I got the wrong server ID.
[10939.79s -> 10940.63s]  I don't know what's happening.
[10940.63s -> 10941.67s]  If somebody can troubleshoot with me,
[10941.71s -> 10943.39s]  I think I have to go up here.
[10943.39s -> 10944.23s]  Who is that guy?
[10944.23s -> 10945.07s]  Who is that guy?
[10945.07s -> 10945.91s]  What a weird guy.
[10945.91s -> 10946.75s]  This guy's weird.
[10946.75s -> 10947.59s]  A lunatic.
[10947.59s -> 10948.43s]  Was that somebody in the call?
[10948.43s -> 10949.27s]  Who was that?
[10949.27s -> 10951.83s]  Oh shit, I didn't know it was still on.
[10951.83s -> 10954.07s]  It's been on for hours now.
[10955.11s -> 10956.87s]  I forgot your old voice.
[10956.87s -> 10958.95s]  Can we ban Iron Giant?
[10958.95s -> 10960.46s]  No.
[10960.46s -> 10963.94s]  All right.
[10963.94s -> 10967.27s]  Well, all right, we just need to figure out
[10967.27s -> 10968.11s]  a solution to our problem.
[10968.11s -> 10970.43s]  I don't fucking care if we lost, I'm doing the joke.
[10970.43s -> 10971.75s]  Yeah.
[10971.75s -> 10974.07s]  What's up, Jack?
[10974.07s -> 10974.91s]  That was pretty good.
[10974.91s -> 10976.55s]  That was phenomenal, Jerma.
[10977.43s -> 10980.11s]  Oh, just one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit.
[10980.11s -> 10980.95s]  He's dead.
[10980.95s -> 10982.03s]  Okay, we're good, good, good, good, good.
[10982.03s -> 10982.87s]  Goddamn.
[10982.87s -> 10983.71s]  Woo.
[10983.71s -> 10984.55s]  Hey, what up?
[10984.55s -> 10985.39s]  How's it going?
[10985.39s -> 10986.23s]  What's up, Doc?
[10986.23s -> 10987.07s]  What's up, Doc?
[10987.07s -> 10988.67s]  I just bit my tongue in half.
[10988.67s -> 10989.79s]  We're in costume.
[10989.79s -> 10993.11s]  I'm Mercy from the Overwatch 2.
[10993.11s -> 10994.27s]  And who's that?
[10994.27s -> 10995.23s]  And hey, how are you?
[10995.23s -> 10996.19s]  It's me, Deadpool.
[10996.19s -> 10997.15s]  It's nice to see everybody.
[10997.15s -> 10998.91s]  Oh my God, it's so good to have you here.
[10998.91s -> 11000.35s]  Yeah, special guest here.
[11000.35s -> 11001.47s]  So where do we start?
[11001.47s -> 11002.31s]  I don't know, man.
[11002.31s -> 11003.15s]  I just showed up.
[11003.15s -> 11003.99s]  I just got the call.
[11003.99s -> 11004.83s]  Yeah.
[11004.83s -> 11005.67s]  They were like, hey man,
[11006.23s -> 11007.07s]  on Charlie's show.
[11007.07s -> 11008.11s]  I'm like, I love that guy.
[11008.11s -> 11010.73s]  Of course I'm going to be on that show.
[11010.73s -> 11012.53s]  I knocked out that motherfucker in the parking lot,
[11012.53s -> 11013.37s]  by the way.
[11013.37s -> 11014.21s]  He looked at me weird.
[11014.21s -> 11015.77s]  No, that sounds exactly what he deserved.
[11015.77s -> 11017.55s]  I'm like, I got to him.
[11017.55s -> 11018.67s]  Show him your high kick.
[11018.67s -> 11019.55s]  Yeah.
[11019.55s -> 11025.81s]  I went like this.
[11025.81s -> 11027.73s]  Hey kids.
[11027.73s -> 11032.82s]  Soda.
[11032.82s -> 11034.22s]  This sucked so bad.
[11034.22s -> 11035.22s]  Nobody move.
[11035.22s -> 11036.06s]  It's starting to lag.
[11036.06s -> 11037.86s]  It's starting to lag out.
[11037.86s -> 11040.42s]  I actually can't, I'm starting to get sick, I think.
[11040.42s -> 11042.06s]  I'm going to get sick.
[11042.06s -> 11043.78s]  I'm at like 20 frames a second.
[11045.14s -> 11047.98s]  Oh God, it's getting sick.
[11047.98s -> 11049.02s]  Here we go.
[11052.04s -> 11053.16s]  Soda said embarrassing.
[11053.16s -> 11054.08s]  Oh shit.
[11054.08s -> 11055.40s]  Oh shit, this is bad.
[11055.40s -> 11056.24s]  Actually be careful.
[11056.24s -> 11057.80s]  This might actually be flashing lights and stuff.
[11057.80s -> 11058.64s]  I'm not kidding.
[11058.64s -> 11066.63s]  Half these awards are embarrassing.
[11066.63s -> 11067.47s]  Okay, here you go.
[11067.47s -> 11070.02s]  You ready?
[11070.02s -> 11086.90s]  It's time for the latest episode of Breaking Bad.
[11086.90s -> 11088.30s]  This is fucking stupid.
[11088.30s -> 11090.26s]  That was so bad.
[11090.26s -> 11092.22s]  This is fucking dumb, man.
[11092.22s -> 11093.66s]  This is dumb.
[11093.66s -> 11096.42s]  If Jerma reads this, he has to do a pushup on stream.
[11113.46s -> 11124.79s]  Oh fuck.
[11124.79s -> 11133.06s]  Oh fuck.
[11133.06s -> 11138.28s]  I would have voted for Five Nights at Freddy's.
[11138.28s -> 11142.19s]  That's what I would have voted for.
[11142.19s -> 11144.63s]  But some of those I don't think deserve to be there.
[11144.63s -> 11146.52s]  I really don't.
[11146.52s -> 11148.28s]  Breaking Bad was just, I don't know.
[11148.28s -> 11150.08s]  I was just reaching at that point
[11150.08s -> 11152.36s]  because we were on the high of Scooby-Doo.
[11152.36s -> 11153.92s]  What's new, Scooby-Doo?
[11153.92s -> 11156.84s]  Coming after you, gonna find that.
[11156.84s -> 11158.36s]  And it's like, wow, this is so much fun.
[11158.36s -> 11159.20s]  I'm having so much fun.
[11159.20s -> 11160.44s]  Oh, what are the TV shows?
[11160.44s -> 11163.48s]  What are the television shows can we do, right?
[11163.48s -> 11165.00s]  Eh, I was reaching on the high.
[11167.09s -> 11168.97s]  Ladies and gentlemen, your winner
[11168.97s -> 11172.13s]  for worst joke of the entire year.
[11172.13s -> 11176.25s]  The worst joke of the year is
[11176.25s -> 11182.26s]  with 32% of the vote, someone got in the Discord.
[11185.94s -> 11187.86s]  Someone got in the Discord and it wasn't me.
[11187.86s -> 11190.18s]  Oh, someone's in the Discord.
[11190.18s -> 11193.10s]  Sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's was 22%,
[11193.10s -> 11194.18s]  but hold on a minute.
[11195.26s -> 11198.26s]  So number two is Sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's.
[11198.26s -> 11201.86s]  Number three on best of the year
[11201.86s -> 11204.83s]  was Sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's.
[11204.83s -> 11208.37s]  So it was top three on here and top three on here.
[11208.37s -> 11211.14s]  You guys need to make up your mind.
[11211.14s -> 11217.10s]  And then doing pushups was 16.8%.
[11217.10s -> 11220.31s]  I would have voted for that one, probably.
[11220.31s -> 11222.67s]  The Breaking Bad one was pretty awful,
[11222.67s -> 11226.03s]  but you know, I'm not looking forward
[11226.03s -> 11232.98s]  to these next couple of categories.
[11232.98s -> 11235.38s]  These videos are probably 10 minutes long.
[11235.42s -> 11237.98s]  Something about the worst and best noise categories
[11237.98s -> 11242.71s]  this year, I mean, the mods went through it.
[11242.71s -> 11244.07s]  Me and Holly went through it.
[11244.99s -> 11247.48s]  We had to narrow this down.
[11247.48s -> 11250.86s]  Best and worst noise of the year,
[11250.86s -> 11254.58s]  there were 60 nominees until we really had
[11254.58s -> 11256.06s]  to get rid of some.
[11256.06s -> 11259.30s]  I think we brought it down to like 25 in each category.
[11259.30s -> 11262.82s]  So strap in, turn your volume down
[11262.82s -> 11265.02s]  because here are your nominees
[11265.06s -> 11271.98s]  for best noise of the year.
[11271.98s -> 11276.69s]  Or turn your volume up if that's what you care about.
[11276.69s -> 11277.73s]  Jesus.
[11277.73s -> 11280.17s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[11280.17s -> 11283.14s]  Score.
[11283.14s -> 11287.36s]  No!
[11287.36s -> 11291.65s]  One thing I can hold, I can hold the Wilma for.
[11291.65s -> 11307.94s]  Wilma!
[11307.94s -> 11309.22s]  Fucking long, dude.
[11310.02s -> 11312.02s]  I tried to walk over to my water in VR.
[11312.02s -> 11313.22s]  Hold on, no, that's not how that works.
[11313.22s -> 11314.38s]  Oh, I got a drink too.
[11314.38s -> 11319.22s]  That's pretty sus.
[11319.22s -> 11322.10s]  There was a cricket outside last night.
[11322.10s -> 11322.94s]  I swear to God.
[11323.78s -> 11324.62s]  I always wanted to record it,
[11324.62s -> 11326.02s]  like just get audio recorded
[11326.02s -> 11328.06s]  because this thing was so loud
[11328.06s -> 11331.14s]  and it was going super speed.
[11331.14s -> 11334.82s]  It wasn't, brr, brr, brr, brr.
[11334.82s -> 11337.98s]  This guy was looking for somebody.
[11337.98s -> 11344.17s]  It was like, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.
[11344.17s -> 11345.01s]  Just like, what is it?
[11345.01s -> 11346.01s]  It was a hurt.
[11346.01s -> 11346.85s]  It was like static.
[11346.85s -> 11348.05s]  I couldn't stand it.
[11348.05s -> 11350.29s]  You know what sound that makes too.
[11350.29s -> 11351.13s]  It's like.
[11354.69s -> 11355.53s]  You just like that
[11355.53s -> 11357.13s]  because it sounds like the teacher noise.
[11357.13s -> 11357.97s]  Whee!
[11359.99s -> 11361.27s]  I can put it over my head.
[11361.27s -> 11365.07s]  Moving an amount of water from one room to another.
[11365.07s -> 11365.99s]  And go like this.
[11370.82s -> 11371.94s]  Should I do this?
[11371.94s -> 11372.94s]  Okay, I'll do it.
[11378.02s -> 11379.78s]  No, I just heard that in my head.
[11379.78s -> 11380.62s]  That hurt.
[11387.96s -> 11390.48s]  I heard somebody laugh off camera.
[11390.48s -> 11393.76s]  This is the Tasmanian devil in the electric chair.
[11393.76s -> 11394.60s]  Okay.
[11395.16s -> 11396.92s]  This doesn't sound right at all.
[11396.92s -> 11399.48s]  And let's do a scream test.
[11399.48s -> 11400.32s]  Wee!
[11400.32s -> 11401.16s]  Wee!
[11401.16s -> 11402.00s]  Wee!
[11402.88s -> 11404.00s]  Fixed it.
[11404.00s -> 11409.84s]  How can we look plastic today?
[11409.84s -> 11411.76s]  I mean, I don't feel plastic.
[11420.20s -> 11421.04s]  Two, two, one up.
[11421.04s -> 11422.88s]  That was pretty good.
[11441.38s -> 11442.38s]  Fuck.
[11442.38s -> 11443.22s]  Oh no.
[11443.22s -> 11444.06s]  It's one of those.
[11444.10s -> 11447.74s]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[11447.74s -> 11450.30s]  You're wearing red because you're the imposter.
[11450.30s -> 11451.14s]  Yes.
[11460.74s -> 11462.10s]  When I'm lying in my death bed
[11462.10s -> 11463.62s]  and I'm connected to like, you know what?
[11463.62s -> 11464.78s]  I'm like 90 or something.
[11464.78s -> 11466.62s]  Like a hundred.
[11466.62s -> 11468.14s]  And everyone's like gathered around the bed
[11468.14s -> 11469.62s]  and everyone's like, oh, let's just say goodbye
[11469.62s -> 11471.22s]  to grandpa, right?
[11471.22s -> 11473.22s]  You bet your ass that I'm gonna be like.
[11481.16s -> 11482.00s]  You bet your fucking ass
[11482.00s -> 11483.84s]  that's the last thing I'm leaving you with.
[11485.78s -> 11487.90s]  Give me, give me, give me, give me.
[11510.10s -> 11518.35s]  This is sucking me up.
[11518.35s -> 11522.86s]  How many people are here right now on the channel?
[11522.86s -> 11525.48s]  Do I have a number?
[11525.48s -> 11526.88s]  65.
[11526.88s -> 11529.79s]  There's 65,000 people here.
[11529.79s -> 11534.83s]  And you just got subjected to that.
[11534.83s -> 11539.58s]  So, should I apologize, or should we wait?
[11540.52s -> 11544.16s]  Should we wait for this one?
[11544.16s -> 11546.32s]  I'm gonna hold my apologies till this one.
[11548.29s -> 11551.93s]  Ladies and gentlemen, the, oh, I may have ripped it.
[11551.93s -> 11556.67s]  The winner for best noise of the entire year.
[11557.57s -> 11559.91s]  Was it ever gonna be close?
[11559.91s -> 11562.47s]  Let's spam it in the chat.
[11562.47s -> 11564.13s]  You know what it is, spam it.
[11565.41s -> 11567.27s]  I'll do it if you spam it.
[11567.27s -> 11568.67s]  I'll do it if you spam it.
[11570.21s -> 11579.40s]  Mm-hmm, scorn.
[11579.40s -> 11584.40s]  With 39% of the vote, scorn absolutely killed it.
[11587.07s -> 11589.99s]  Gimme, gimme, gimme was only 15.
[11589.99s -> 11592.41s]  Scorn absolutely dominated this category.
[11593.31s -> 11597.23s]  And then, are you the imposter was three.
[11597.23s -> 11599.63s]  So, scorn, a scorn sweep right there.
[11599.63s -> 11601.43s]  40% of the vote almost.
[11601.43s -> 11606.43s]  39.7% actually, which is, that's a lot.
[11606.79s -> 11609.99s]  So, to the almost 60, 70,000 people that are here right now,
[11609.99s -> 11613.07s]  I apologize for this next category.
[11613.07s -> 11614.73s]  I apologize in advance.
[11614.73s -> 11616.75s]  I said a lot of sorrys already,
[11616.75s -> 11618.87s]  but it's time for another one.
[11618.87s -> 11622.25s]  I'm sorry about this category.
[11622.25s -> 11625.11s]  Most nominees, I think, total.
[11625.11s -> 11627.51s]  That had to get dwindled down,
[11627.51s -> 11631.23s]  but we have a best noise, we have a worst noise.
[11631.23s -> 11634.51s]  They could just be the same category.
[11634.51s -> 11638.71s]  I should just do a thing where it's just noise of the year,
[11638.71s -> 11640.79s]  because why even have two categories?
[11641.71s -> 11645.69s]  Here are your nominees for worst noise of the year.
[11667.17s -> 11668.29s]  It's just, you know what I mean?
[11668.29s -> 11674.84s]  It's just the, it doesn't even lather up either.
[11674.84s -> 11684.32s]  I'm so, that was bad.
[11684.32s -> 11690.19s]  You've seen me do it, like a hundred times.
[11690.19s -> 11691.65s]  You can't dodge them all.
[11692.49s -> 11701.80s]  He's like, he's turning.
[11701.80s -> 11703.56s]  Oh shit, he's turning.
[11703.56s -> 11705.40s]  He just growled at him.
[11705.40s -> 11708.52s]  Wrong game, wrong game from software, wrong game.
[11744.96s -> 11746.16s]  Like some people eat a lobster,
[11746.16s -> 11747.32s]  like it's literally the last thing
[11747.32s -> 11749.72s]  they're ever gonna eat in their entire life.
[11749.72s -> 11750.56s]  And they like,
[11753.61s -> 11755.17s]  what's in here?
[11755.17s -> 11759.82s]  And it's just like, God damn it, what are you doing?
[11759.82s -> 11765.24s]  Oh, there's some still in there.
[11765.24s -> 11767.60s]  And I just, I don't like it, I don't like it.
[11767.60s -> 11768.80s]  I don't like it at all.
[11768.80s -> 11769.64s]  It's revolting.
[11769.64s -> 11770.48s]  It's absolutely fucking revolting.
[11770.48s -> 11772.12s]  How about you fucking relax?
[11774.77s -> 11778.01s]  Young Madduck, apprentice to Hunwit, the dream chanter,
[11778.01s -> 11780.17s]  removes his instrument from its case.
[11780.17s -> 11783.25s]  His features, composed, take on a startling dignity.
[11786.28s -> 11788.60s]  Let's hear it.
[11795.14s -> 11795.98s]  Oh!
[11803.74s -> 11807.42s]  What, this is on here twice?
[11807.42s -> 11809.26s]  How many times was this nominated?
[11815.72s -> 11818.28s]  Can I just say this is the worst moment of the whole year?
[11818.28s -> 11819.12s]  I can say that, right?
[11819.12s -> 11821.98s]  It's my channel.
[11821.98s -> 11826.62s]  Wait, it's from the ghost.
[11826.62s -> 11827.46s]  That's it?
[11827.46s -> 11834.82s]  It goes like, I just threw one of those nerf,
[11834.82s -> 11837.18s]  you know those nerfs, whistlers?
[11837.18s -> 11838.02s]  The thing that like,
[11838.02s -> 11839.98s]  Brett Favre was in the commercial and he threw it like,
[11840.46s -> 11841.62s]  I can throw this a hundred yards.
[11841.62s -> 11842.46s]  And it goes.
[11844.54s -> 11845.82s]  I just threw one of those.
[11849.39s -> 11853.60s]  I know what this is for.
[11853.60s -> 11855.00s]  We're all the way over here.
[11858.12s -> 11858.96s]  So.
[11858.96s -> 11859.80s]  What's wrong with you?
[11859.80s -> 11860.64s]  What's wrong with you?
[11860.64s -> 11865.04s]  My baby, my baby, I only chose.
[11865.04s -> 11866.88s]  Hold on.
[11866.88s -> 11868.30s]  No.
[11868.30s -> 11869.14s]  Oh.
[11870.14s -> 11871.46s]  I'm sorry, I'm really in production.
[11871.46s -> 11873.10s]  Probably fucking just cringed.
[11878.74s -> 11879.58s]  Did you guys hear that?
[11879.58s -> 11887.40s]  What the fuck was that?
[11887.40s -> 11890.88s]  There is recency bias, I think, on this one.
[11890.88s -> 11893.95s]  We have some recency bias, I think.
[11893.95s -> 11894.79s]  I don't think,
[11894.79s -> 11897.39s]  I can literally see it through the paper, by the way.
[11899.80s -> 11900.64s]  I peeked.
[11903.42s -> 11904.26s]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[11904.26s -> 11905.86s]  the worst noise of the entire year,
[11905.86s -> 11909.92s]  recency bias, come on.
[11909.92s -> 11914.46s]  The multi versus squeal at 20% of the vote,
[11914.46s -> 11916.81s]  not that bad.
[11916.81s -> 11920.55s]  Growls at chat with 18.8.
[11920.63s -> 11923.19s]  And I don't even, I don't know what this one is.
[11924.19s -> 11927.03s]  Suck, snort, wheeze, cackle.
[11927.91s -> 11930.36s]  Do we even know, what is that one?
[11930.36s -> 11932.60s]  Suck, snort, wheeze, cackle.
[11932.60s -> 11934.84s]  I was trying to watch, but I couldn't even,
[11934.84s -> 11936.28s]  I don't know what that one is.
[11937.56s -> 11938.40s]  Very good to know.
[11940.31s -> 11943.25s]  A third most skipped category.
[11943.25s -> 11948.25s]  13% of you that took the test did not take this one.
[11948.33s -> 11949.77s]  You're like, fuck it, I don't wanna hear that.
[11949.77s -> 11951.43s]  I don't care.
[11951.43s -> 11954.11s]  Which makes sense considering there's so many categories.
[11954.11s -> 11957.43s]  And okay, but multi versus squeal.
[11957.43s -> 11959.07s]  Hey, multi versus is a great game.
[11959.07s -> 11960.47s]  You should try it.
[11960.47s -> 11961.31s]  You know what?
[11961.31s -> 11963.76s]  Can we check in with the puzzle room?
[11963.76s -> 11964.76s]  Let's take a look at the puzzle room.
[11964.76s -> 11966.92s]  How's the puzzle, the puzzler's doing?
[11969.18s -> 11974.18s]  No one's doing anything.
[11976.90s -> 11979.86s]  Have they not done any of the puzzle?
[11981.25s -> 11984.16s]  Zero, hold on.
[11984.20s -> 11986.60s]  There's only one person doing it.
[11986.60s -> 11987.60s]  I'm going in there.
[11989.00s -> 11992.76s]  There's only one, they're all just like eating sandwiches.
[11992.76s -> 11994.08s]  I need to see the progress.
[11994.08s -> 11995.92s]  Oh, God.
[12005.89s -> 12014.04s]  I'm not gonna be angry.
[12014.04s -> 12014.88s]  Hi everybody.
[12019.93s -> 12023.13s]  It seems as if there is,
[12023.13s -> 12026.53s]  it looks like you've blocked out some areas.
[12028.29s -> 12029.53s]  Can you get this?
[12031.09s -> 12032.25s]  Where's the camera?
[12032.29s -> 12034.49s]  Can you see this over here?
[12035.41s -> 12039.97s]  They have one edge of one of the corners.
[12041.57s -> 12043.77s]  What have you been doing in here?
[12043.77s -> 12044.61s]  What's going on?
[12044.61s -> 12045.43s]  What are you doing here?
[12045.43s -> 12046.27s]  What is this?
[12046.27s -> 12047.49s]  You playing cards?
[12047.49s -> 12053.26s]  Yeah.
[12053.26s -> 12056.79s]  Excuse me.
[12056.79s -> 12061.20s]  What?
[12061.20s -> 12064.95s]  Santa said to be nicer.
[12064.95s -> 12076.51s]  So if you could please finish one section.
[12077.43s -> 12079.59s]  This was a lot of money.
[12079.59s -> 12080.91s]  This cost a lot of money.
[12080.91s -> 12082.59s]  You heard Ludwig and you heard H. Rucker.
[12082.59s -> 12084.87s]  By the way, where the fuck are they?
[12084.87s -> 12086.47s]  Sorry if it's worth.
[12086.47s -> 12089.48s]  You know what?
[12089.48s -> 12093.44s]  They're drinking and they're drinking too.
[12093.44s -> 12094.40s]  You know what?
[12094.40s -> 12095.68s]  Deal me.
[12095.68s -> 12098.00s]  You want to go?
[12098.00s -> 12100.00s]  Blackjack, you and me.
[12100.00s -> 12100.84s]  Who wants to go?
[12100.84s -> 12102.16s]  You and me?
[12102.16s -> 12103.24s]  Blackjack.
[12103.24s -> 12105.09s]  I'll be the dealer.
[12105.09s -> 12106.33s]  Where are the cards?
[12106.33s -> 12107.57s]  Let's go Blackjack.
[12108.09s -> 12110.49s]  What are these comically huge cards?
[12112.30s -> 12115.18s]  Hey, by the way, is this the Ace of Clubs?
[12115.18s -> 12116.02s]  Nope.
[12116.02s -> 12118.34s]  That would have been fucking insane if it was.
[12118.34s -> 12119.18s]  You want to go Blackjack?
[12119.18s -> 12120.42s]  Ready?
[12120.42s -> 12121.66s]  You want to play Blackjack?
[12124.36s -> 12125.56s]  Why did you write this?
[12127.44s -> 12128.96s]  You wanted to see that movie?
[12129.92s -> 12130.76s]  In here.
[12133.87s -> 12136.67s]  You just wanted to see Avatar 2 The Way of Water.
[12136.71s -> 12139.95s]  We don't pay us enough to go watch it ourselves.
[12139.95s -> 12141.15s]  What does this one say?
[12142.51s -> 12146.03s]  Send hot cups of, that's a funny joke.
[12146.03s -> 12147.23s]  What does this one say?
[12148.35s -> 12149.59s]  My name is Danny Elfman.
[12149.59s -> 12150.67s]  Please hurry.
[12152.27s -> 12153.67s]  I actually don't get it.
[12153.67s -> 12155.71s]  Do it for Puzzle Girl.
[12155.71s -> 12156.83s]  Who's Puzzle Girl?
[12157.83s -> 12159.60s]  You.
[12159.60s -> 12161.56s]  What are we doing exactly?
[12162.60s -> 12163.44s]  Do it.
[12165.00s -> 12165.92s]  Okay.
[12165.92s -> 12166.76s]  You ready?
[12168.12s -> 12170.97s]  Everybody here is being, by the way,
[12170.97s -> 12172.77s]  everybody here is being paid.
[12172.77s -> 12175.05s]  Just want to make sure everyone understands that.
[12175.05s -> 12175.89s]  How much you bet?
[12176.89s -> 12179.29s]  Yeah, I don't want the bank to take care of you.
[12179.29s -> 12180.85s]  It's like 600 bucks.
[12190.78s -> 12192.90s]  Right there is eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[12192.90s -> 12194.46s]  That's 14.
[12194.46s -> 12195.30s]  What are you going to do?
[12195.30s -> 12198.10s]  Versus a, by the way, can you see this?
[12198.10s -> 12199.14s]  I got a 10 showing here.
[12199.14s -> 12200.94s]  What are you going to do?
[12200.94s -> 12202.70s]  You're going to hit.
[12202.70s -> 12204.90s]  That is eight, five, 10.
[12204.90s -> 12205.94s]  That's 18.
[12205.94s -> 12207.06s]  You're going to stay?
[12207.06s -> 12207.90s]  Staying.
[12207.90s -> 12209.64s]  Okay.
[12209.64s -> 12214.96s]  Don't look.
[12214.96s -> 12215.80s]  17.
[12227.69s -> 12228.53s]  Stop!
[12230.42s -> 12231.66s]  Give me that.
[12231.66s -> 12232.58s]  Give me that toy.
[12232.58s -> 12233.66s]  Don't give it to him.
[12233.66s -> 12235.54s]  Give me, Santa, if you're watching,
[12235.54s -> 12237.14s]  I'm just being funny.
[12237.14s -> 12237.98s]  Give me that toy.
[12242.98s -> 12245.30s]  I've made sure to not.
[12245.30s -> 12249.78s]  Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.
[12250.82s -> 12255.54s]  35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60.
[12255.54s -> 12256.74s]  You just made $60.
[12258.38s -> 12271.75s]  Woo!
[12271.75s -> 12272.83s]  Gonna do another category.
[12272.83s -> 12273.67s]  Excuse me.
[12273.67s -> 12274.99s]  Merry Christmas!
[12274.99s -> 12280.78s]  Merry Christmas!
[12280.78s -> 12281.62s]  What do you mean you can't do?
[12281.62s -> 12284.10s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12284.10s -> 12285.90s]  Can't do math?
[12285.90s -> 12286.74s]  What happened?
[12287.82s -> 12288.94s]  I can't do math.
[12288.94s -> 12291.04s]  What happened?
[12291.04s -> 12291.88s]  Did I get it?
[12291.88s -> 12292.72s]  Wait.
[12292.72s -> 12293.56s]  Count those cards.
[12293.56s -> 12296.80s]  Wait, hold on a second.
[12296.80s -> 12298.00s]  This is 17.
[12298.00s -> 12298.84s]  That's 10.
[12298.84s -> 12299.68s]  18.
[12299.68s -> 12302.07s]  What are you talking about?
[12302.07s -> 12303.47s]  She won.
[12303.47s -> 12304.35s]  What do you mean you can't count?
[12304.35s -> 12305.75s]  That's literally 18 versus seven.
[12305.75s -> 12307.59s]  What are you talking about?
[12308.43s -> 12310.83s]  I'm a man of my word, so guess what?
[12310.83s -> 12315.83s]  All the elves in this area, you're going to split $60.
[12317.99s -> 12325.28s]  Woo!
[12325.28s -> 12328.36s]  Elves, elves, elves, elves, elves, elves, elves, elves, elves.
[12328.36s -> 12329.44s]  13 elves.
[12329.44s -> 12332.48s]  Ladies and gentlemen, 13 elves divided,
[12332.48s -> 12334.52s]  60 divided by 13 is?
[12334.52s -> 12336.08s]  $100.
[12336.08s -> 12339.08s]  Yeah!
[12339.08s -> 12340.24s]  Each.
[12340.24s -> 12342.21s]  It's like two bucks each.
[12342.21s -> 12343.37s]  Hey, how about this?
[12344.41s -> 12345.97s]  We'll double your pay.
[12352.71s -> 12356.80s]  How much they were getting paid in the end is good.
[12356.80s -> 12357.76s]  Whatever.
[12357.76s -> 12360.76s]  I mean, they were paid to do a puzzle
[12360.76s -> 12362.72s]  and they didn't do it.
[12362.72s -> 12363.56s]  Let me make sure.
[12363.56s -> 12365.20s]  Let me be very clear.
[12365.20s -> 12366.04s]  They were paid.
[12366.04s -> 12370.15s]  They were all, those people were paid to be here.
[12370.15s -> 12374.20s]  They were all paid to be here to do a puzzle.
[12374.20s -> 12377.46s]  How much income is that worth?
[12377.46s -> 12378.50s]  I'll double their pay.
[12378.50s -> 12379.42s]  Fine.
[12379.42s -> 12382.68s]  Yeah.
[12382.68s -> 12383.52s]  How about this?
[12383.52s -> 12385.45s]  Hey elves, can you hear me?
[12385.45s -> 12388.92s]  Elves, you can hear me, right?
[12388.92s -> 12390.64s]  How about this?
[12390.64s -> 12393.68s]  You get one section done.
[12393.68s -> 12396.20s]  And I mean, even a border.
[12397.52s -> 12400.56s]  And I'll quadruple your pay.
[12400.56s -> 12404.85s]  I wonder if they'll do it.
[12404.85s -> 12407.83s]  I will five times your pay.
[12407.83s -> 12409.51s]  Get a border done.
[12412.25s -> 12414.09s]  100 each?
[12414.09s -> 12416.21s]  Look, now they're all standing.
[12416.21s -> 12417.53s]  Now they're all ready to go.
[12417.53s -> 12419.29s]  They're like, holy shit, let's go.
[12424.64s -> 12426.36s]  They were all sitting before.
[12427.74s -> 12430.70s]  Now, hey, can we give it up for the elves?
[12431.54s -> 12433.51s]  In the chat, give it up for the elves.
[12433.51s -> 12435.75s]  You know, hey, hey, hey, you know what?
[12435.75s -> 12440.40s]  Hey, hey, let's five times their pay for fucking no reason.
[12440.40s -> 12442.24s]  How does that sound?
[12442.24s -> 12443.08s]  I'll do it.
[12443.08s -> 12447.22s]  Easy.
[12447.22s -> 12448.72s]  Do the puzzle.
[12448.72s -> 12450.16s]  That's what you're here for.
[12450.16s -> 12452.44s]  And I may have almost hit somebody in the face
[12452.44s -> 12454.60s]  with that turkey that I threw.
[12455.60s -> 12458.08s]  All right, we're at the next category.
[12458.08s -> 12462.24s]  This is best one guy moment.
[12462.24s -> 12465.20s]  One guy, there's a lot of people here.
[12465.72s -> 12467.64s]  I imagine some of you don't know what the hell this means.
[12467.64s -> 12472.64s]  A one guy is when somebody kind of derails the stream.
[12474.72s -> 12477.88s]  I will see it, I will comment on it,
[12477.88s -> 12481.44s]  and it changes the outcome of the rest of the day.
[12481.44s -> 12483.24s]  It's not just, oh, yeah, yeah, I read a comment.
[12483.24s -> 12484.24s]  No, no, no, no.
[12484.24s -> 12486.72s]  A one guy moment is you've changed
[12486.72s -> 12489.08s]  the course of history completely.
[12492.07s -> 12504.80s]  Here are your nominees for best one guy moment of the year.
[12505.20s -> 12506.72s]  I'm not gonna encourage this behavior,
[12506.72s -> 12508.60s]  but I'm gonna tell you something right now.
[12508.60s -> 12510.72s]  Don't fucking, this is not to be encouraged,
[12510.72s -> 12512.84s]  but it was just like, what the fuck, man?
[12513.96s -> 12516.56s]  Somebody asked what the baseball stream is.
[12516.56s -> 12517.48s]  And I said, whatever.
[12517.48s -> 12519.32s]  And then like, it's been like five minutes.
[12519.32s -> 12520.84s]  It's been like at least five minutes.
[12520.84s -> 12522.76s]  Somebody like added that person, I think,
[12522.76s -> 12525.04s]  and said he's gonna shove an entire baseball
[12525.04s -> 12527.00s]  up his ass on the stream.
[12527.00s -> 12530.08s]  This person's name too, yeah, what the fuck?
[12530.08s -> 12534.16s]  Their name was Ball Fondler, okay?
[12534.24s -> 12535.08s]  Okay.
[12535.08s -> 12536.80s]  Remember, you're on the website.
[12536.80s -> 12538.16s]  For collecting all of them.
[12538.16s -> 12539.00s]  What?
[12539.00s -> 12540.40s]  I don't want to stifle the intrinsic-
[12540.40s -> 12542.08s]  You're on the QR code?
[12542.08s -> 12542.92s]  What?
[12542.92s -> 12549.08s]  It's taking this friend of thumbnails.
[12549.08s -> 12551.04s]  Is it there?
[12551.04s -> 12552.89s]  All right.
[12552.89s -> 12555.68s]  What?
[12555.68s -> 12558.22s]  All right, now put the tarantula in my mouth.
[12558.22s -> 12559.90s]  Put the tarantula in my mouth.
[12559.90s -> 12561.70s]  I'm gonna be like shocked that it's in there.
[12561.70s -> 12562.54s]  You know what I mean?
[12562.54s -> 12565.86s]  Like.
[12565.86s -> 12568.44s]  I keep pulling.
[12571.20s -> 12574.12s]  The dev, the dev is even sick of this joke.
[12574.96s -> 12575.80s]  The dev is like, all right, it's kind of funny,
[12575.80s -> 12577.64s]  but like fucking hurry up.
[12577.64s -> 12579.72s]  I mean, we have to summon the person
[12579.72s -> 12582.40s]  that's called Barf Drinker, okay?
[12582.40s -> 12583.24s]  And then that's it.
[12583.24s -> 12585.20s]  Oh my God, I'm gonna get BM'd, aren't I?
[12588.62s -> 12594.80s]  It's so stupid.
[12594.80s -> 12596.64s]  He's throwing rocks at me.
[12596.64s -> 12597.48s]  All right.
[12597.48s -> 12599.52s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[12600.56s -> 12602.04s]  No, no, no.
[12602.04s -> 12608.88s]  I'm not gonna let this happen.
[12608.88s -> 12609.88s]  Oh my God, I'm dead.
[12609.88s -> 12611.24s]  I can't believe this.
[12611.24s -> 12612.64s]  We're watching you in a bar, Jerma.
[12612.64s -> 12614.58s]  Do something wacky.
[12614.58s -> 12617.85s]  Hey.
[12617.89s -> 12622.42s]  Hey, this one goes out to all y'all in the bar.
[12622.42s -> 12630.09s]  Hey, three, two, one, let's go.
[12630.09s -> 12632.82s]  Mm, green tea.
[12632.82s -> 12635.14s]  They can't even hear me.
[12635.14s -> 12636.38s]  Should I try to communicate?
[12636.38s -> 12640.81s]  Hey, you, wait, look.
[12640.81s -> 12645.41s]  Hey, everybody, hey.
[12645.41s -> 12652.96s]  One, two, three.
[12652.96s -> 12654.59s]  Yeah.
[12654.59s -> 12655.83s]  Oh, I wanna show this too.
[12655.83s -> 12657.26s]  Hold on.
[12657.26s -> 12659.86s]  Somebody actually made this.
[12659.86s -> 12664.38s]  These are really romantic candles.
[12664.42s -> 12669.67s]  No, it probably stinks up here.
[12669.67s -> 12672.31s]  I, gosh, I filled the room with red candles
[12672.31s -> 12675.58s]  like you wanted.
[12675.58s -> 12679.67s]  Gary, you fucking idiot.
[12679.67s -> 12683.07s]  Did you have to get the red cinnamon apple candle
[12683.07s -> 12685.27s]  from Yankee Candle and put it in every room?
[12687.58s -> 12690.81s]  Somebody said just eat a handful.
[12690.81s -> 12692.21s]  That'd be so fucked up.
[12692.21s -> 12693.21s]  You'd probably have like,
[12693.21s -> 12696.45s]  you'd probably have like a fucking like mental breakdown.
[12697.57s -> 12698.93s]  It's not designed for that.
[12698.93s -> 12700.17s]  Eat a handful.
[12700.49s -> 12704.05s]  It'd be fucking disgusting.
[12704.05s -> 12705.96s]  I'm kind of curious.
[12705.96s -> 12719.06s]  I'm curious, let's go.
[12719.06s -> 12720.90s]  It tastes like hamburger meat.
[12720.90s -> 12722.34s]  It tastes like hamburger meat.
[12723.50s -> 12725.42s]  Do you want Mario drug PSA?
[12732.71s -> 12735.11s]  Hoo, b-ah-hoo, b-ah-hoo.
[12735.11s -> 12738.58s]  Whoa.
[12738.58s -> 12740.43s]  Hi, ladies and gentlemen.
[12740.43s -> 12742.82s]  I'm Super Mario.
[12742.82s -> 12743.94s]  We've made a lot of jokes here today.
[12743.94s -> 12745.46s]  We've had a lot of fun.
[12745.46s -> 12747.76s]  And I'm an actor.
[12747.76s -> 12749.04s]  But let me just be the first to tell you that,
[12749.04s -> 12750.36s]  you know, it's not fun.
[12750.48s -> 12756.06s]  What is not totally b-ah-hoo, drugs and alcohol.
[12756.06s -> 12757.30s]  This is by somebody in the community.
[12757.30s -> 12759.38s]  Are they comfortable with me sharing their name?
[12759.38s -> 12762.22s]  I don't want to share their name if they're not comfortable.
[12762.22s -> 12765.22s]  Ah, but anyways, they discovered a new way
[12765.22s -> 12767.42s]  of isolating viruses that kill
[12767.42s -> 12770.27s]  antibiotic resistant bacteria.
[12770.27s -> 12773.82s]  Somebody in this community.
[12773.82s -> 12776.02s]  And the first one I discovered using this method,
[12776.02s -> 12778.66s]  I named after germa.
[12778.66s -> 12781.10s]  This is apparently it fucking working.
[12781.42s -> 12786.14s]  Against bacteria, antibiotic bacteria resistant shit.
[12786.14s -> 12787.86s]  That's me in there.
[12787.86s -> 12790.78s]  That's me taking care of that.
[12790.78s -> 12792.18s]  I'm in there and I'm getting all of those
[12792.18s -> 12794.38s]  fucking molecules and I'm destroying them.
[12794.38s -> 12795.66s]  Make a sandwich with wood.
[12795.66s -> 12806.08s]  Make a wood sandwich.
[12808.78s -> 12811.14s]  I can't, I can't.
[12811.14s -> 12818.37s]  Submit this.
[12818.37s -> 12819.57s]  Play for now.
[12819.57s -> 12823.76s]  Okay.
[12823.76s -> 12824.96s]  Fucking quit the goddamn game.
[12824.96s -> 12830.03s]  I exited the fucking game.
[12830.03s -> 12833.84s]  What the fuck is happening?
[12833.84s -> 12848.30s]  If Jerma reads this, he has to do a pushup on stream.
[12848.30s -> 12852.25s]  One, two, three, seven.
[12863.86s -> 12864.94s]  Oh, fuck.
[12864.94s -> 12866.22s]  Oh, fuck.
[12866.22s -> 12870.34s]  The ring light around your neck.
[12870.34s -> 12874.14s]  If I put the ring light around my neck,
[12874.14s -> 12875.42s]  it could actually fit.
[12876.94s -> 12878.46s]  That would be fucking stupid.
[12878.46s -> 12882.42s]  Wait a minute.
[12890.96s -> 12892.36s]  Nice swag, thanks.
[12893.32s -> 12897.95s]  I was told that if I spin a hundred times at $10,
[12897.95s -> 12900.92s]  starting with a thousand dollars on this slot machine,
[12900.92s -> 12903.84s]  that I will be able to get to 10,000 plus dollars.
[12903.84s -> 12905.28s]  There's a person in chat here who is putting
[12905.28s -> 12910.15s]  their stream chat life here.
[12910.15s -> 12911.43s]  They're going to be banned from the channel
[12911.43s -> 12913.95s]  if it doesn't work or they're gonna get VIP'd if it does.
[12913.95s -> 12919.73s]  Three, four, five.
[12919.73s -> 12923.08s]  Oh my God.
[12923.08s -> 12925.32s]  I'm so sorry.
[12925.32s -> 12927.46s]  Hello.
[12927.50s -> 12928.66s]  Yeah, and guess what?
[12928.66s -> 12930.02s]  You can hear me, huh?
[12930.02s -> 12931.74s]  You can hear me pretty well.
[12931.74s -> 12935.73s]  Not like it was before.
[12935.73s -> 12937.41s]  What the fuck, dude?
[12937.41s -> 12939.67s]  I'm not gonna drink a, hold on.
[12939.67s -> 12942.00s]  All right, hold on.
[12942.00s -> 12942.84s]  Let's tweet that.
[12942.84s -> 12943.92s]  How long is this fucking?
[12943.92s -> 12946.32s]  Yeah, so hopefully it sounds all right.
[12946.32s -> 12948.04s]  These things are pretty cool.
[12948.04s -> 12949.60s]  These things, let me try a scream test.
[12949.60s -> 12951.88s]  Can I try, can I try, hold on.
[12951.88s -> 12952.72s]  Can I scream?
[12952.72s -> 12953.56s]  Can I scream in your ears?
[12953.56s -> 12955.68s]  I'm gonna scream in your ears.
[12955.68s -> 12959.11s]  They should fucking remove geometry from school.
[12959.11s -> 12960.55s]  Teach people how to do their taxes.
[12960.55s -> 12964.70s]  I got some soft locked?
[12964.70s -> 12965.54s]  How?
[12965.54s -> 12966.38s]  No, I'm not.
[12966.38s -> 12968.98s]  Someone tell Jerma I can tell them how to fix their save.
[12968.98s -> 12969.82s]  How do I do it?
[12969.82s -> 12970.74s]  How do I do it?
[12970.74s -> 12972.06s]  How do I do it?
[12972.06s -> 12973.26s]  That's so funny.
[12973.26s -> 12974.34s]  How do I fix my save?
[12974.34s -> 12977.30s]  Try X560Y330.
[12977.30s -> 12978.14s]  New tweet.
[12978.14s -> 12978.98s]  No, wait.
[12978.98s -> 12981.20s]  Z330.
[12981.20s -> 12984.46s]  Oh, Dev, looks like you're having a little bit of trouble
[12984.46s -> 12987.22s]  with geometry, aren't you?
[12987.22s -> 12988.90s]  Looks like the Dev is having a little bit of trouble
[12988.90s -> 12989.74s]  with geometry.
[12990.98s -> 12994.22s]  Dev, when was the last time you were in fucking high school?
[12994.22s -> 12995.38s]  When was I?
[12995.38s -> 12997.54s]  I am gonna get so validated right now.
[12997.54s -> 13001.07s]  I suck at math.
[13001.07s -> 13001.95s]  I suck at math.
[13001.95s -> 13002.95s]  I am in my 30s.
[13002.95s -> 13004.91s]  I haven't had to do this for years.
[13004.91s -> 13005.91s]  Go look at the tweet right now.
[13005.91s -> 13007.71s]  I'm gonna fucking, I'm framing this.
[13007.71s -> 13010.71s]  I'm literally going to frame that tweet from Dusk Dev.
[13013.23s -> 13015.99s]  No, I don't want, all right.
[13015.99s -> 13018.71s]  Can I just delete all the weapons besides the shotgun
[13018.71s -> 13021.51s]  and the, I don't wanna like, oh, right, right, right.
[13021.51s -> 13022.51s]  Yes.
[13022.51s -> 13023.47s]  Oh, sorry, that was loud.
[13023.47s -> 13025.83s]  Unequip all of your weapons.
[13025.83s -> 13027.67s]  That is definitely the way.
[13029.43s -> 13032.87s]  Yes, unequip all of your weapons.
[13032.87s -> 13034.67s]  That is definitely the way.
[13034.67s -> 13037.23s]  As the voice actor for this fight, making fun of me.
[13038.63s -> 13040.61s]  Bro, that looked like Battle Chess.
[13043.50s -> 13044.74s]  You can turn me back on.
[13052.65s -> 13055.66s]  Battle Chess.
[13055.66s -> 13057.18s]  Oh, that's, oh my God.
[13057.18s -> 13060.38s]  You just ruined Dark Souls 2 for me forever.
[13060.38s -> 13063.62s]  You just ruined Dark, I can't even play this again.
[13063.62s -> 13065.10s]  Andy funny voices.
[13065.10s -> 13067.08s]  You said that wrong.
[13067.72s -> 13068.56s]  Andy funny voices.
[13068.56s -> 13070.60s]  No, no, no, no, no, excuse me, I gotta correct you.
[13070.60s -> 13072.92s]  That's funny voice Andy.
[13072.92s -> 13075.10s]  Andy funny voices.
[13075.10s -> 13076.90s]  Andy funny voice, I love that.
[13076.90s -> 13078.74s]  That's my favorite comment of the week.
[13078.74s -> 13082.58s]  That's so, I love that wording.
[13082.58s -> 13084.42s]  Time that person up for five seconds.
[13084.42s -> 13088.42s]  If you lose, you have to get one of the gyros from Arby's.
[13088.42s -> 13090.26s]  I love this, this was so fun.
[13090.26s -> 13091.10s]  This was so fun.
[13091.10s -> 13092.80s]  Grossest fast food item.
[13092.80s -> 13094.62s]  You know what's crazy?
[13094.62s -> 13096.86s]  I don't want to eat fucking Arby's.
[13096.86s -> 13098.84s]  I don't want that at all.
[13099.76s -> 13100.60s]  I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[13100.60s -> 13105.18s]  I'm going to be silent now.
[13105.18s -> 13106.82s]  Oh shit.
[13106.82s -> 13108.78s]  Oh no, I don't want to go to Arby's.
[13108.78s -> 13114.60s]  I did it.
[13114.60s -> 13116.86s]  Sorry, Arby's fans.
[13116.86s -> 13118.22s]  Not tonight.
[13118.22s -> 13120.40s]  Causing havoc on the highway.
[13120.40s -> 13129.64s]  We're on break core for this.
[13129.64s -> 13131.68s]  Restart, restart the mission.
[13131.68s -> 13133.52s]  Restart the mission.
[13133.52s -> 13135.12s]  This is fucking with my head.
[13135.12s -> 13136.40s]  This is fucking with my head.
[13136.40s -> 13138.60s]  Imagine if the police were listening to this.
[13149.51s -> 13151.23s]  It's too fucked up.
[13151.23s -> 13158.48s]  It's too fucked up.
[13158.48s -> 13164.36s]  So there are a lot of funny people in this community.
[13164.36s -> 13165.68s]  I've known this for a long time.

[13360.55s -> 13363.63s]  I went like, I went reverse cross,

[13402.48s -> 13403.60s]  I'm just going up the stairs,
[13403.60s -> 13405.28s]  I don't give a shit if he hears me.
[13409.75s -> 13411.28s]  Oh!
[13413.28s -> 13414.64s]  I thought he was downstairs.
[13416.36s -> 13419.24s]  Oh my God, that was the worst thing ever.
[13419.24s -> 13421.04s]  That was probably the worst thing ever.
[13432.13s -> 13434.49s]  Ah!
[13434.49s -> 13435.33s]  In a circle.
[13438.36s -> 13441.64s]  That was the chicken, that was the fucking rooster.
[13441.64s -> 13444.04s]  That was a rooster, that was actually a rooster.
[13444.04s -> 13446.08s]  I don't know what that means, but whatever.
[13447.89s -> 13449.57s]  Jesus Christ, dude.
[13452.46s -> 13454.12s]  Where is he?
[13454.12s -> 13455.28s]  Whoa!
[13455.28s -> 13458.04s]  Oh, the fucking thing, the drape.
[13458.04s -> 13460.96s]  I thought like a tentacle came down and grabbed me.
[13463.86s -> 13465.22s]  What the fuck, dude, why?
[13465.22s -> 13468.14s]  Now I'm like, I'm all cracked out now.
[13468.14s -> 13470.99s]  Holy shit.

[13472.31s -> 13473.90s]  Ah!
[13473.90s -> 13474.90s]  It's like a monster.
[13483.00s -> 13486.05s]  It's just sound effects, it's not even, nothing here.
[13486.05s -> 13491.14s]  There's nothing here.
[13491.14s -> 13492.14s]  Oh my God, it's a bat.
[13492.14s -> 13500.96s]  Hey!
[13503.68s -> 13505.28s]  I got a frying pan.
[13505.28s -> 13506.68s]  Oh shit.
[13506.68s -> 13508.36s]  I have what's it called, flash.
[13508.36s -> 13509.36s]  I could throw it at everyone.
[13509.36s -> 13511.32s]  I've got six minis.
[13511.32s -> 13512.16s]  Oh!
[13512.16s -> 13515.00s]  Run, I'm sorry, I don't know how to skip this run.
[13515.04s -> 13516.84s]  I don't know, I went in the dumpster.
[13516.84s -> 13517.68s]  It's okay.
[13519.68s -> 13521.12s]  I thought you were getting killed.
[13521.12s -> 13522.24s]  No, I thought I was dead, dude.
[13522.24s -> 13523.08s]  I was like, what the fuck?
[13523.08s -> 13524.04s]  Somebody like sniped me.
[13524.04s -> 13524.96s]  It was terrifying.
[13528.99s -> 13535.44s]  Oh!
[13557.17s -> 13560.41s]  That would be a fucked up start to Mickey Mouse's clubhouse.
[13572.67s -> 13578.25s]  Where do I go from here?
[13578.25s -> 13583.60s]  Okay, turn it off.
[13583.60s -> 13588.62s]  Turn that off, close it up.
[13588.62s -> 13597.57s]  What?
[13603.00s -> 13605.12s]  I'm wearing the same sweater too.
[13606.04s -> 13607.52s]  I have the same clothes on.
[13610.43s -> 13611.83s]  Relax, holy shit, dude.
[13611.83s -> 13612.99s]  Are you kidding me?
[13612.99s -> 13615.12s]  This is not even scary.
[13615.12s -> 13616.00s]  Did I just fake that?
[13616.00s -> 13617.36s]  No, I really didn't, I swear to God,
[13617.36s -> 13618.72s]  but like that was way over,
[13618.72s -> 13620.76s]  I haven't played a scary game in a long time.
[13632.18s -> 13634.66s]  Oh my God, how am I alive?
[13634.66s -> 13637.46s]  I am absolutely, I was like, what are you pointing at?
[13647.40s -> 13648.24s]  It's a cliff.
[13656.00s -> 13660.93s]  What?
[13660.93s -> 13661.77s]  Jesus.
[13666.29s -> 13668.25s]  I just shot down my computer.
[13668.25s -> 13670.01s]  I think I shot my computer.
[13670.01s -> 13678.04s]  I think I shot my computer down.
[13678.04s -> 13681.76s]  Wow, a lot of scares this year.
[13681.76s -> 13684.88s]  A lot of scares.
[13684.88s -> 13686.76s]  I wanna know what you guys picked.

[13690.95s -> 13691.91s]  Yeah.

[13728.70s -> 13731.94s]  The cutoff of the awards was right
[13731.94s -> 13734.42s]  at that puppet combo stream last year.
[13734.42s -> 13738.94s]  So, honestly, I think a couple of years came off my life
[13738.94s -> 13740.58s]  after that.
[13740.58s -> 13744.19s]  I felt awful after that stream.
[13744.19s -> 13747.11s]  I think I remember talking about it later,
[13747.11s -> 13750.17s]  being like, I feel bad, I feel awful.
[13750.17s -> 13752.33s]  I have a headache, my chest hurts.
[13752.33s -> 13755.36s]  It actually felt terrible after that.
[13755.36s -> 13759.56s]  Anyways, we are getting to the final seven awards.
[13759.56s -> 13761.60s]  This is getting juicy.

[13764.88s -> 13769.52s]  Time to get to the big ones.
[13769.52s -> 13774.76s]  Now, every year, I like to sing some songs.

[13820.30s -> 13823.90s]  When the road looks rubberhead
[13823.94s -> 13828.66s]  And you're miles and miles from your nice, warm bed.
[13829.92s -> 13833.60s]  You just remember what your old pal said.
[13833.60s -> 13836.96s]  But you got a friend in me.

[13879.56s -> 13881.88s]  Oh, the misery.
[13881.88s -> 13884.08s]  Every single person is my enemy.
[13885.28s -> 13886.52s]  That's all. That's the only thing I know.
[13886.52s -> 13893.28s]  I don't know anything else.
[13893.28s -> 13895.76s]  You gotta find that mystery.
[13895.76s -> 13897.60s]  And this is Scooby Doo.
[13897.60s -> 13899.24s]  Coming after you.
[13899.24s -> 13901.36s]  Fuck the Scooby Doo.
[13901.36s -> 13902.84s]  This is the fucking new Zoomer shit.
[13902.84s -> 13904.48s]  This is not what I want.
[13905.44s -> 13909.55s]  To the streets.
[13909.55s -> 13911.67s]  You got me up the cigarette.
[13911.67s -> 13913.67s]  Is that sceptre on my feet?
[13914.79s -> 13916.99s]  You need to find a reason.
[13916.99s -> 13919.47s]  Reason things went wrong.
[13919.47s -> 13923.67s]  Got to find a reason why my money's all gone.
[13923.67s -> 13924.51s]  Oh!
[13927.08s -> 13929.40s]  I could still get high.
[13929.40s -> 13933.92s]  And I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot.
[13934.88s -> 13937.16s]  Not this one.
[13937.16s -> 13938.00s]  Hope not.
[13959.36s -> 13961.76s]  Scared.
[13961.76s -> 13964.97s]  That's what you want.

[13974.32s -> 13975.16s]  What are you doing now?
[13975.16s -> 13977.18s]  You're supposed to be scared.
[13977.18s -> 13980.46s]  John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.
[13980.46s -> 13983.50s]  His name is my name too.
[13983.50s -> 13984.34s]  That's bad.
[13984.34s -> 13986.98s]  Whenever we go out, we always shout.
[13986.98s -> 13990.02s]  Here comes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.
[13990.02s -> 13990.86s]  Why is this?
[13991.38s -> 13992.78s]  Get in the bathroom quick.
[13992.78s -> 13993.62s]  This is terrible.
[13993.62s -> 13994.50s]  Chat a la la bye.
[13997.38s -> 13998.46s]  Little baby, I don't see a burn.
[13998.46s -> 13999.58s]  I'm going to buy you a mugging burn.
[13999.58s -> 14000.74s]  If that mugging bird don't sing,
[14000.74s -> 14001.82s]  I'm going to buy you an iron ring.
[14001.82s -> 14002.98s]  If that diamond ring don't shine,
[14002.98s -> 14008.93s]  I'm going to buy you a glass of wine.
[14008.93s -> 14011.29s]  When you get old enough, over 21.
[14011.29s -> 14014.48s]  We're getting apples and bananas remix.
[14014.48s -> 14016.00s]  Are you talking about like the...
[14016.00s -> 14020.76s]  I want to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas.

[14021.88s -> 14025.68s]  I like to eat, eat, eat, eight percent banana.
[14027.24s -> 14030.48s]  And feel like I belong.

[14037.53s -> 14041.03s]  I'll be there someday.
[14041.03s -> 14044.15s]  If I can be strong,
[14044.15s -> 14047.55s]  I know every mile

[14056.44s -> 14068.70s]  to feel like I belong.
[14068.70s -> 14071.44s]  Well, I liked that last one.
[14071.44s -> 14073.28s]  That was pretty good.
[14073.28s -> 14075.36s]  Well, we'll see what you think.

[14116.11s -> 14118.87s]  all the Hatsune Miku fans, po-pi-po.
[14118.87s -> 14120.55s]  And then Hercules, go the distance,
[14120.55s -> 14122.51s]  which was actually the good one.
[14122.51s -> 14124.39s]  That was the good one.
[14124.39s -> 14128.59s]  At 9.85%, good job, by the way, good job.
[14128.63s -> 14130.03s]  There you go.
[14130.03s -> 14133.27s]  But now, I do wanna do something very special.
[14134.35s -> 14136.07s]  We saw them earlier,
[14136.07s -> 14138.71s]  didn't really get a chance to show off
[14138.71s -> 14140.51s]  what they could actually do.
[14140.51s -> 14142.87s]  Feel like it's a good place to do it though.
[14142.87s -> 14147.03s]  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back into the studio,
[14147.03s -> 14155.08s]  Top Shelf Vocal, couple of actual good songs here.
[14155.08s -> 14158.32s]  And I'm gonna get outta here because I shouldn't be here.
[14158.32s -> 14160.52s]  Santa did tell me to be better.
[14160.52s -> 14162.96s]  Top Shelf Vocal, ladies and gentlemen,
[14162.96s -> 14172.51s]  with a couple of songs.
[14172.51s -> 14177.11s]  Joy to the world, the Lord is come.
[14177.11s -> 14181.67s]  Let earth receive her King.
[14181.67s -> 14186.23s]  Let every heart prepare Him room.
[14186.23s -> 14188.39s]  And heaven and nature sing.
[14188.39s -> 14190.59s]  And heaven and nature sing.
[14190.59s -> 14195.23s]  And heaven and nature sing.
[14195.23s -> 14199.43s]  Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns.
[14199.43s -> 14203.79s]  Let men their songs employ.
[14203.79s -> 14208.27s]  Rock fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains.
[14208.27s -> 14210.43s]  Repeat the sounding joy.
[14210.43s -> 14212.63s]  Repeat the sounding joy.
[14212.63s -> 14217.31s]  Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.
[14217.31s -> 14221.55s]  He rules the world with truth and grace.
[14221.55s -> 14225.84s]  And makes the nations prove
[14225.84s -> 14230.28s]  the glories of His righteousness.
[14230.28s -> 14232.48s]  And wonders of His love.
[14232.48s -> 14234.72s]  And wonders of His love.
[14234.72s -> 14241.44s]  And wonders, wonders of His love.
[14241.44s -> 14246.67s]  Thank you.
[14246.67s -> 14252.30s]  Thank you so much for bringing some joy to the world.
[14252.30s -> 14253.86s]  We're gonna slow it down just a little bit
[14253.86s -> 14268.40s]  because tonight we want to bring in a holy night.
[14268.44s -> 14277.31s]  Oh, the stars are brightly shining.
[14277.31s -> 14286.29s]  It is the night of our dear Savior's birth.
[14286.29s -> 14295.05s]  Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
[14295.05s -> 14303.81s]  Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
[14303.89s -> 14311.77s]  A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices.
[14311.77s -> 14319.68s]  For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
[14319.68s -> 14327.28s]  Fall on your knees.
[14327.32s -> 14335.12s]  Oh, hear the angel voices.
[14335.12s -> 14342.49s]  Oh, night divine.
[14342.49s -> 14350.60s]  Oh, when Christ was born.
[14350.60s -> 14355.28s]  Oh, night.
[14355.28s -> 14361.89s]  Oh, holy night.
[14361.89s -> 14368.01s]  Oh, night divine.
[14368.01s -> 14373.69s]  Thank you all so much.
[14373.69s -> 14374.21s]  Thank you.
[14374.21s -> 14374.97s]  Yeah.
[14374.97s -> 14376.33s]  Happy holidays to all.
[14376.33s -> 14376.89s]  Thank you.
[14376.89s -> 14377.81s]  Yeah, thank you for having us.
[14377.81s -> 14378.65s]  Thank you for having us.
[14378.65s -> 14379.41s]  Appreciate it.
[14379.41s -> 14381.57s]  That was absolutely unbelievable.
[14381.57s -> 14382.09s]  Thank you.
[14382.09s -> 14382.73s]  Thank you.
[14382.73s -> 14386.41s]  You all out here to actually do a song.
[14386.41s -> 14389.89s]  So with that, now don't listen.
[14389.89s -> 14392.29s]  I want you guys to don't listen to this.
[14392.29s -> 14395.53s]  We're going to go to the next category, which is maybe
[14395.53s -> 14397.57s]  the worst singing of the year.
[14397.57s -> 14399.73s]  Maybe I sing.
[14399.73s -> 14400.37s]  You've heard me.
[14400.37s -> 14402.09s]  I've sung before a few times.
[14402.09s -> 14403.17s]  Yeah, a couple of times.
[14403.17s -> 14404.41s]  Yeah.
[14404.41s -> 14408.57s]  Here are your nominees for the worst singing of the year,
[14408.57s -> 14411.05s]  right after that great performance.
[14411.05s -> 14415.62s]  You guys killed it.
[14415.62s -> 14424.76s]  That was fucking amazing.
[14424.76s -> 14429.20s]  Somebody said, Bjork?
[14429.20s -> 14431.00s]  What do you mean, Bjork?
[14431.00s -> 14432.80s]  I don't sound like Bjork.
[14432.80s -> 14433.88s]  What do you mean?
[14433.88s -> 14436.76s]  All I think is sing.
[14436.76s -> 14439.77s]  We're shouting in the wind.
[14439.77s -> 14444.92s]  And then somebody says, Bjork.
[14444.92s -> 14448.50s]  And I'm like, ugh.
[14448.50s -> 14456.25s]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[14456.25s -> 14460.88s]  Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.
[14460.88s -> 14462.72s]  Take a punch to the face.
[14462.72s -> 14472.32s]  We're all good friends, and we all get together sometimes.
[14472.32s -> 14475.08s]  When you're feeling down and you're feeling out of luck
[14475.08s -> 14479.36s]  and out of change, we will work together and we will help.
[14479.36s -> 14480.36s]  I'm sorry.
[14480.36s -> 14481.68s]  That's what I expected.
[14481.68s -> 14482.68s]  That's what I expected.
[14482.68s -> 14484.20s]  I expected that.
[14484.20s -> 14486.16s]  She's such a misfit.
[14486.16s -> 14487.44s]  Always ready to fight.
[14487.48s -> 14491.16s]  She's got a super beam, and she's raising high
[14491.16s -> 14495.49s]  if you believe you're strong.
[14495.49s -> 14497.05s]  Do you know the whole song?
[14497.05s -> 14497.89s]  I don't know.
[14497.89s -> 14499.93s]  I heard like a minute of it.
[14499.93s -> 14506.53s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[14506.53s -> 14509.96s]  Sing a good night song for Boba.
[14509.96s -> 14516.54s]  Boba, the kitty, have a good rest.
[14516.54s -> 14520.30s]  See you in the morning.
[14520.30s -> 14525.63s]  Boba, such a good kitty.
[14525.63s -> 14528.83s]  See you in the morning.
[14528.83s -> 14531.59s]  Good morning, good morning, good morning to you all.
[14531.59s -> 14534.60s]  Good morning, good morning.
[14534.60s -> 14537.38s]  I'm going to take a fall.
[14537.38s -> 14540.58s]  It's such a wonderful world we live in, in this nice street.
[14540.58s -> 14541.42s]  We're almost there.
[14541.42s -> 14544.00s]  Here we are.
[14544.00s -> 14545.44s]  Oh, they're missing me.
[14545.44s -> 14551.83s]  Every, every, my, every single person is my enemy.
[14551.83s -> 14553.31s]  Here it goes, here it goes.
[14553.31s -> 14555.95s]  We go from Nashville to Norway,
[14555.95s -> 14562.07s]  to Zimbabwe, Chicago, Czechoslovakia, and back.
[14562.07s -> 14565.91s]  But she'll be like...
[14565.91s -> 14569.36s]  Fucking god damn it.
[14569.36s -> 14572.08s]  The weather outside is bright.
[14572.08s -> 14572.80s]  What's wrong with this?
[14572.80s -> 14576.84s]  I got fire, solar light.
[14576.84s -> 14580.08s]  Since we know place.
[14580.08s -> 14581.34s]  Hold on.
[14581.34s -> 14583.06s]  Since we know place.
[14583.06s -> 14583.86s]  I'll get it.
[14583.86s -> 14585.35s]  Shut up.
[14585.35s -> 14588.35s]  Since we know place to go.
[14588.35s -> 14591.79s]  Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
[14591.79s -> 14593.15s]  Use that part.
[14593.15s -> 14593.79s]  What was wrong with that?
[14593.79s -> 14597.29s]  That was fine.
[14597.29s -> 14600.98s]  You've got a friend in me.
[14600.98s -> 14603.57s]  Got a friend in me.
[14603.57s -> 14605.27s]  Two people.
[14605.27s -> 14608.43s]  Having one of a life and I have...
[14608.43s -> 14611.55s]  That's it, right?
[14611.55s -> 14613.27s]  All right, I'm going to count you guys in, OK?
[14613.27s -> 14615.51s]  Three, two, one, go.
[14615.51s -> 14619.11s]  She sang over the hills.
[14619.11s -> 14623.27s]  It instantly voice jammered me.
[14623.27s -> 14624.31s]  Take your headphones out.
[14624.31s -> 14625.67s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[14625.67s -> 14626.31s]  Sorry, sorry.
[14626.31s -> 14627.47s]  Take out your headphones.
[14627.47s -> 14627.87s]  OK.
[14627.87s -> 14628.91s]  Ready?
[14628.91s -> 14630.99s]  Three, two, one.
[14630.99s -> 14632.87s]  She sang over the hills.
[14632.87s -> 14636.15s]  Peaks are shy, but sure dawn.
[14636.15s -> 14639.95s]  And sure as the sun rise, I'll someday be gone.
[14639.95s -> 14645.27s]  But recall me, my love, and our joy may live on.
[14645.27s -> 14650.55s]  And you do, and you do, and you do.
[14650.55s -> 14651.31s]  That's a howl at the end.
[14651.31s -> 14662.44s]  There has to be a howl at the end.
[14662.44s -> 14666.54s]  Some of those weren't that bad.
[14666.54s -> 14667.98s]  I mean, cringe.
[14667.98s -> 14670.14s]  Is it like a most cringe category?
[14670.14s -> 14673.43s]  Maybe, no?
[14673.43s -> 14681.27s]  I have to top the shelf vocal, I know.
[14681.27s -> 14684.56s]  These were close.
[14684.56s -> 14687.65s]  It was pretty much every single nominee.
[14687.65s -> 14694.69s]  15.5, 14.4, 13.9, 13, 12.
[14694.69s -> 14695.57s]  It's all of them.
[14695.57s -> 14697.63s]  You couldn't choose.
[14697.63s -> 14702.24s]  But if you had to, with 15.5% of the vote, it's Björk.
[14702.24s -> 14704.04s]  Björk wins.
[14704.04s -> 14710.27s]  And then right underneath that 14.4% was Beatbox O,
[14710.27s -> 14711.91s]  The Misery.
[14711.91s -> 14720.21s]  And then 13.9% was the Splatoon 3 laughing song.
[14720.21s -> 14724.73s]  I mean, the Björk.
[14724.73s -> 14726.61s]  That stream, I would have nominated
[14726.61s -> 14728.83s]  for worst stream of the year.
[14728.87s -> 14730.64s]  Is it in there?
[14730.64s -> 14732.68s]  It might be.
[14732.68s -> 14735.12s]  All right, let's count the categories.
[14735.12s -> 14738.84s]  We've got one, two, three, four, five.
[14738.84s -> 14740.96s]  We've got, what, five or six categories remaining?
[14740.96s -> 14742.91s]  These are the huge ones.
[14742.91s -> 14745.83s]  These are the major, massive categories.
[14748.17s -> 14749.87s]  Are you ready?
[14749.87s -> 14751.19s]  How you guys feel?
[14751.19s -> 14752.83s]  You guys in the Christmas spirit?
[14752.83s -> 14755.56s]  Holiday spirit?
[14755.56s -> 14757.28s]  Yeah?
[14757.28s -> 14759.10s]  Can you please do a Björk?
[14759.10s -> 14762.93s]  Yeah.
[14762.93s -> 14768.70s]  I should shine more than fire.
[14768.70s -> 14770.76s]  Pretty good.
[14770.76s -> 14772.93s]  Pretty good.
[14772.93s -> 14775.84s]  I tried.
[14775.84s -> 14778.52s]  Björk is a very talented singer, by the way.
[14778.52s -> 14781.16s]  More talented than I will ever be.
[14781.16s -> 14782.98s]  Times 100.
[14782.98s -> 14784.18s]  Just make that clear.
[14784.18s -> 14786.02s]  I have nothing on Björk.
[14786.02s -> 14792.08s]  Zero.
[14792.08s -> 14794.43s]  What's that say?
[14794.43s -> 14798.24s]  That is best gamer moment of the year.
[14798.24s -> 14799.92s]  Did I do good in a game?
[14799.92s -> 14803.70s]  Did I play Call of Duty versus a hacker?
[14803.70s -> 14805.94s]  Who may have been cheating, we don't know.
[14807.71s -> 14811.39s]  See him for lunch or dinner on Friday.
[14811.39s -> 14815.28s]  Extinguisher, if you still hear me.
[14815.28s -> 14817.84s]  I like extra lettuce on my hamburgers.
[14817.84s -> 14820.20s]  I like crunch.
[14820.20s -> 14822.16s]  Best gamer moment of the year incoming.
[14822.16s -> 14826.12s]  These are the moments that I actually did very well.
[14826.12s -> 14827.36s]  Not this one.
[14827.36s -> 14828.40s]  Don't look at that one yet.
[14828.40s -> 14829.80s]  It's not time for that one.
[14829.80s -> 14831.40s]  We're gonna put that down
[14831.40s -> 14832.84s]  and we're gonna show you the nominees
[14832.84s -> 14836.88s]  for best gaming moment of the year.
[14836.88s -> 14840.00s]  This is when I did well.
[14840.00s -> 14841.20s]  Here are your nominees.
[14843.91s -> 14845.63s]  Somebody's probably actually insane.
[14845.63s -> 14850.14s]  Banned that person for an hour.
[14850.14s -> 14851.74s]  And then like, you bet like a little bit there.
[14851.74s -> 14853.78s]  And then maybe I'd be like, you know,
[14853.78s -> 14856.74s]  what's 50 more?
[14856.74s -> 14857.58s]  You know what I mean?
[14857.58s -> 14859.18s]  It's a nominal amount.
[14859.18s -> 14860.26s]  It's a nominal amount.
[14860.26s -> 14861.50s]  Somebody said Elmo.
[14862.50s -> 14863.86s]  What does that mean?
[14863.86s -> 14869.34s]  Oh, Jerma, you absolute idiot.
[14869.34s -> 14870.34s]  Am I stupid?
[14870.34s -> 14877.62s]  Cause I just won the game.
[14877.62s -> 14880.08s]  That's a three of a kind.
[14880.08s -> 14881.24s]  You just got shocked.
[14891.28s -> 14892.32s]  Were you here?
[14892.32s -> 14893.88s]  Were you in the room?
[14893.88s -> 14895.98s]  Were you in the fucking room?
[14895.98s -> 14897.58s]  I got a bet for you.
[14897.58s -> 14900.38s]  And I complete my own mini golf course
[14900.38s -> 14903.52s]  in less than 20 strokes.
[14903.52s -> 14908.72s]  Six and seven.
[14908.72s -> 14910.96s]  Here comes seven.
[14910.96s -> 14912.48s]  Motherfuckers, you didn't think
[14912.48s -> 14918.68s]  I was gonna skip the whole goddamn course?
[14918.68s -> 14919.52s]  Yes.
[14926.15s -> 14927.79s]  You all lose.
[14927.79s -> 14929.79s]  You all lose.
[14929.79s -> 14931.87s]  Never bet against me again.
[14932.79s -> 14933.79s]  What's happening?
[14933.79s -> 14934.63s]  Am I winning?
[14936.64s -> 14937.84s]  Am I beating them?
[14937.84s -> 14938.72s]  I don't know.
[14948.88s -> 14952.99s]  Did I win?
[14952.99s -> 14957.89s]  Why won't he fight me?
[14957.89s -> 14960.98s]  Hurry up, run.
[14960.98s -> 14961.82s]  God damn it.
[14961.82s -> 14965.64s]  I knew it was a problem.
[14965.64s -> 14967.24s]  I have to be off to this guy
[14967.24s -> 14968.80s]  before he rings the alarm.
[14973.05s -> 14973.89s]  Come on.
[14978.49s -> 14986.04s]  Why is he so much faster than me?
[14986.04s -> 14998.14s]  I got him.
[14998.14s -> 15006.23s]  I beat him.
[15006.23s -> 15008.87s]  It's a pretty good moments.
[15008.87s -> 15010.67s]  That game is so hard.
[15010.67s -> 15013.24s]  They made it too hard.
[15013.24s -> 15016.32s]  Ultra kill devs if you're watching.
[15016.32s -> 15019.08s]  Your game is too hard.
[15019.08s -> 15020.92s]  Hardest game at Walmart.
[15020.92s -> 15024.16s]  It's not even at Walmart.
[15024.16s -> 15026.16s]  No, that's an old callback.
[15026.16s -> 15028.44s]  The game's hard, just to let you know.
[15028.44s -> 15029.48s]  Anyways, ladies and gentlemen,
[15029.48s -> 15033.12s]  the winner of best gamer moment of the year is,
[15036.69s -> 15039.78s]  this was huge.
[15039.78s -> 15043.10s]  44.6%.
[15043.10s -> 15046.06s]  Almost 45% of the vote.
[15046.06s -> 15048.66s]  The ultimate poker bluff versus Ludwig.
[15049.50s -> 15050.34s]  Wins.
[15051.68s -> 15053.28s]  Come on.
[15053.28s -> 15054.96s]  Took all his money.
[15054.96s -> 15055.84s]  He's here somewhere.
[15055.84s -> 15057.12s]  He's back there somewhere.
[15057.12s -> 15057.96s]  Sorry, Ludwig.
[15059.10s -> 15060.38s]  Beat you in poker.
[15060.38s -> 15061.98s]  It's my game.
[15061.98s -> 15063.18s]  And then after the first try,
[15063.18s -> 15067.96s]  Cuphead DLC boss at what, 14.8%?
[15067.96s -> 15069.88s]  That's not even close.
[15069.88s -> 15073.92s]  And then beating Ulcerated Tree Spirit early.
[15073.92s -> 15075.64s]  But that was, what's so impressive?
[15075.64s -> 15077.80s]  You beat the Tree Spirit, who cares?
[15077.80s -> 15080.00s]  That was like 30 levels too early.
[15080.64s -> 15082.40s]  I accidentally walked into that boss.
[15082.40s -> 15086.52s]  So that's pretty impressive, I think.
[15086.52s -> 15088.16s]  So there you go.
[15088.16s -> 15091.88s]  Weirdly enough, the mini golf course
[15091.88s -> 15093.72s]  was fourth or fifth place.
[15093.72s -> 15097.00s]  People thought the Ludwig bluff was way better.
[15097.00s -> 15102.37s]  And just like the good, there's also the bad.
[15102.37s -> 15104.25s]  I don't remember these nominees,
[15104.25s -> 15108.21s]  but they were way more than best.
[15108.21s -> 15110.05s]  I think they were, we had to narrow it down
[15110.05s -> 15110.89s]  because I think they were like,
[15110.89s -> 15112.21s]  oh wow, cool, Jeremy,
[15112.21s -> 15115.37s]  he got like seven nominees for best gamer moment
[15115.37s -> 15118.37s]  and 70 for worst gamer moment.
[15118.37s -> 15120.65s]  So we really had to narrow this down.
[15120.65s -> 15122.65s]  Honestly, I don't even know what's on this list.
[15122.65s -> 15123.89s]  I haven't seen it.
[15123.89s -> 15126.89s]  I just knew we did a few passes on it because we had to.
[15127.89s -> 15130.85s]  So here are your nominees for just like best gamer moment.
[15130.85s -> 15134.01s]  Here is the worst gamer moment of the entire year.
[15134.01s -> 15140.21s]  Worst gamer moment.
[15140.21s -> 15142.53s]  This is a nine minute category, by the way,
[15142.53s -> 15143.37s]  so strap in.
[15143.37s -> 15144.73s]  Hand fire tornado.
[15144.73s -> 15146.09s]  Jesus.
[15146.09s -> 15150.66s]  Give fire to the tornado.
[15150.66s -> 15153.54s]  Bro, there ain't no tornado on the screen.
[15153.54s -> 15158.52s]  Hand the fire to the tornado, but do it quietly.
[15158.52s -> 15161.35s]  Orc Minecraft fire.
[15161.35s -> 15165.83s]  Me, me build dirt house and burn it.

[15224.59s -> 15225.71s]  I'm fucking dead.
[15240.71s -> 15242.51s]  It's going to be a lot of damage.
[15242.51s -> 15243.35s]  Yeah, it's going to be a lot.
[15243.35s -> 15244.19s]  I mean, we can try.
[15244.19s -> 15245.95s]  It might as well, right?
[15245.95s -> 15252.96s]  Yeah, you can back out whenever it's looking rough.
[15252.96s -> 15253.80s]  We get fire down at this point.
[15253.80s -> 15255.12s]  Oh, fuck.

[17803.36s -> 17808.72s]  holy shit people are so ugly look at all right oh german you look real handsome today you sure
[17808.72s -> 17821.71s]  about that oh no he killed that guy what oh my god i'm so confused right now
[17826.62s -> 17831.12s]  i told you it was real hey let's do the rest of this with my fucking eyes closed don't make a
[17831.12s -> 17842.20s]  joke stop oh my god what am i doing if i chop you up in a meat grinder and the only thing that
[17842.20s -> 17851.15s]  comes out that's left of you is your eyeball you're you're probably dead now i don't get that move
[17851.15s -> 17856.35s]  at all that move is absolutely unbelievable it's one of those moves that you can't do anything
[17856.35s -> 17861.95s]  about and i'm telling you yeah but you know what else is as ridiculous as that yeah like we're
[17861.95s -> 17873.42s]  gonna get playing soon they're gonna be like i can fly eventually too so those are your nominees
[17874.06s -> 17879.42s]  for best stream or stream series of the year i feel like there are a lot of good ones i feel
[17879.42s -> 17885.88s]  like there was a lot of fun this year i say that every year but i do mean it and let's see i just
[17885.88s -> 17892.84s]  start crying on camera right i'm gonna start i'm gonna cry it's gonna happen just wait all right
[17892.84s -> 17899.72s]  ladies and gentlemen the what you have decided was the best stream or stream series of the year
[17901.90s -> 17909.66s]  oh the misery no uh elden ring at 27.2 percent and let me tell you it makes sense considering i
[17909.66s -> 17915.07s]  streamed that game for almost two straight months there was a high chance it was going
[17915.07s -> 17921.77s]  to be elden ring because it was a third of every stream i did this year and also game of the year
[17921.77s -> 17930.89s]  by the way uh elden ring at 27.2 underneath that is infomercial react andy gonna have to do more
[17930.89s -> 17937.61s]  of those react andy streams because uh okay and then breath i didn't even beat breath of the wild
[17937.61s -> 17943.44s]  yet but uh breath of wild number three by the way this is second most least skipped category
[17944.16s -> 17949.04s]  so people wanted to vote for this but elden ring obviously elden ring swept everything swept the
[17949.04s -> 17955.36s]  game awards swept my awards right so obviously it's gonna win and it was so fun those some of
[17955.36s -> 17962.84s]  the i honestly those some of the funnest streams i had i think ever on the channel that game just
[17962.84s -> 17971.60s]  had so many fun moments once in a generation you get it all right ladies and gentlemen it is time
[17972.72s -> 17978.08s]  we are approaching the final category which it's a small category but it's fun to do
[17978.88s -> 17985.84s]  the last category of the evening is best overall stream event there was only about four or five
[17985.84s -> 17993.92s]  this year um i love doing events i think they're fun get people together have a good time this is
[17993.92s -> 18000.16s]  an event can't vote for this though but hey maybe you can next year hey maybe jot it down for your
[18000.16s -> 18006.80s]  best event of the year the uh germa 95 uh holiday christmas stream but yeah this is gonna be it this
[18006.80s -> 18012.40s]  is the last category of the evening is what you thought the best stream of the year was that was
[18012.40s -> 18026.88s]  a event stream we did non-event here is event here are your nominees most least so what i've
[18026.88s -> 18034.97s]  decided to do is over the last few months we've scoured the country trying to find who i think
[18035.85s -> 18045.50s]  could potentially be able to replace me and a little bit of great and another one here
[18047.42s -> 18053.42s]  all right then we got a little might be a little too much pull back on the speed pull back
