[0.44s -> 12.63s]  Hey, how you doing everybody? Welcome to another day. I streamed yesterday but I had to
[13.51s -> 17.99s]  kind of take a little short there. Cut it a little short because I wasn't feeling well and I have a
[17.99s -> 25.77s]  cough. It's a deep cough. It's inside my body. Like it would be coming from somewhere else.
[26.57s -> 32.57s]  Outside. It's an outside cough. It hasn't gotten better. It's actually gotten a little worse.
[34.60s -> 41.21s]  And that's the unfortunate thing. I woke up this morning. I was a little slow.
[42.09s -> 50.12s]  I'm a little fatigued. But I don't give a shit because Sekiro came up. I've been waiting for
[50.12s -> 55.24s]  this game for a long time. So I don't care how bad I'm going to be coughing. I'm going to be mutant.
[56.90s -> 63.51s]  I'm playing this fucking game now because come on. What am I going to do? I'll wait like a few days.
[64.23s -> 77.99s]  No, no, no. Yeah, there's mucus but it's fine. The Drake no, no, no face.
[81.08s -> 87.34s]  But yeah, we're going to start Sekiro. I'm going in completely blind like we did Dark Souls 3.
[89.30s -> 93.77s]  We'll see how we do. I've heard it's a lot different. I've heard that the game
[93.77s -> 103.38s]  should not be played even remotely like a Dark Souls game. It emphasizes blocking and parries,
[103.38s -> 115.00s]  not dodge rolling. So I'm looking forward to this. Early boy. Yeah, we're a little, we are.
[115.72s -> 120.98s]  And I wasn't feeling great and I didn't want to just see, let it progress even more over the
[120.98s -> 133.19s]  next three or four hours. I took some DayQuil. Go back to bed. No, I'm staying right here.
[133.99s -> 140.57s]  It's Christmas morning for somebody that likes the game company from Software. Christmas only
[140.57s -> 148.47s]  comes once every four years with this company. When was Dark Souls 3? 2015, 2016, 17, 18, 19.
[148.47s -> 169.21s]  So Christmas comes once every three years. Thanks for the early stream. Yeah. How long
[169.21s -> 173.59s]  do you think I'm going to be streaming today? I don't know. It really depends on a couple of
[173.59s -> 183.21s]  factors. It depends on first of all how physically do I feel and if I get stuck on the tutorial boss
[183.21s -> 189.03s]  for the first like four hours. I don't know. I've been playing it since release and it might be
[189.11s -> 198.81s]  too hard. That's what I keep hearing. I keep hearing the game is too hard. I'm, I can't wait.
[199.61s -> 214.73s]  Your immune system is compromised because you're a vegan. Uh, I had a chicken sandwich last night
[216.79s -> 226.41s]  just for the record, you know. And there it is. God, I'm so excited for this. I wish I felt better.
[226.41s -> 230.81s]  I wish I physically didn't feel so fucking awful, but it doesn't matter. Everything's going to be
[230.81s -> 234.65s]  fine. I'm going to get the video game placebo effect and I'm going to start feeling way better
[234.65s -> 246.62s]  in about 10 seconds. This is Sekiro. Shadows die twice. Not like you haven't seen this intro
[246.62s -> 255.78s]  like 50 times. I'm one of like 16,000 people streaming this game right now. I was actually
[255.78s -> 259.06s]  going to type, we're talking to the pre-stream chat. I was going to title this stream in all
[259.06s -> 265.78s]  capitals. Please click mine. Don't scroll down. Click mine. I played Dark Souls. I actually played
[265.78s -> 279.13s]  Dark Souls. It's going to be in all caps. I actually changed. I went in here and I changed.
[279.53s -> 283.85s]  I'm curious as to how this is going to play out because for two reasons, right? I got an Xbox One
[283.85s -> 292.82s]  controller plugged in and I don't like the bumpers on the Xbox controller. So what I did is I changed
[292.82s -> 299.74s]  attack to right trigger and prosthetic tool to right bumper and guard to left trigger. I wonder
[299.74s -> 311.37s]  if that's going to be bad or not. I'm actually considering making attack X. I'm thinking about
[319.69s -> 323.05s]  you can use PS4 controllers. Yeah, but I heard there was issues with it.
[324.01s -> 327.69s]  And the button prompts screw me up too because the button prompts don't change to PS4.
[328.25s -> 335.14s]  Yeah, we'll try. I'm just going to play like this and see how it is. If I need to change it,
[335.14s -> 341.64s]  I'll change it, right? I'm stalling. I know that that top right. Did you see that auto save top
[341.64s -> 348.55s]  right thing? It's been so long since I've seen that. Set it to English. Yeah, it's on English
[348.55s -> 357.82s]  already. All right, here we go. It's been so long since I've played a software, a piece of software
[357.82s -> 368.17s]  developed by From Software. Blood on, subtitles on, HUD. This is all fine. This audio I think is at a
[368.17s -> 377.50s]  decent level. Software from From Software, yes. The game is meant to be played in Japanese.
[378.60s -> 385.30s]  We'll just go back and forth. Every like five minutes I'll switch it.
[385.30s -> 387.22s]  All right, cutscene. Here comes the opening cutscene.
[387.22s -> 404.28s]  In the closing years of the Sengoku era, Japan was consumed by perpetual conflict.
[404.28s -> 426.78s]  Takes place in Japan. The fires of war raged on, spreading deep.
[426.78s -> 452.07s]  Oh, nice shot. Was that bad or good? It has a germa hair. I gotta get comfortable.
[453.35s -> 461.08s]  This game is supposed to be the hardest game ever made. What is the hardest game?
[461.08s -> 462.52s]  Oh my god, shut up. No, no, not you, me.
[478.12s -> 489.37s]  We did it. Master swordsman Isshin Ashina staged a bloody coup and wrested control of the land.
[508.94s -> 520.86s]  What the what? What's the matter, stray? Nothing left to lose. Well, don't grab it by that.
[521.90s -> 529.00s]  Don't you understand? You gotta hand somebody a pair of scissors the other way and hand them
[529.64s -> 534.15s]  handle side, not blade side. From the battlefield, betraying relentlessly.
[534.15s -> 538.95s]  It's like kindergarten safety 101. Went on to become a master shinobi.
[538.95s -> 553.94s]  Was never for the shinobi. As your father, my master is as of today.
[558.41s -> 562.92s]  Defend him with your life. If he's taken, bring him back.
[568.58s -> 581.29s]  I'm sweating right now. I really am. I'm disgusting. I don't know if that's because
[581.29s -> 585.45s]  I might have a fever. I don't know. I'm going to say it's because I'm really excited for
[585.45s -> 593.40s]  Sekiro. Shadow's done twice. After Isshin's coup, the Ashina clan was on the brink of collapse.
[596.57s -> 604.49s]  And the shinobi, known as Wolf, had lost everything. Both the man who took him in
[605.29s -> 617.93s]  and the boy he had sworn to protect. Is that engine? Is that from? So I haven't seen any
[617.93s -> 623.35s]  gameplay. I've been pretty good about keeping away from it. I've seen like maybe I saw I think I saw
[623.35s -> 627.83s]  like the original teaser trailer, but not any. Hey, there's 10 straight minutes of gameplay.
[628.79s -> 634.31s]  This could be a strategy game or a puzzle game and I wouldn't even know.
[636.55s -> 658.55s]  Shinobi. Every minute is at least as hard as pinwheel. Good luck. Okay. That's good to know.
[659.11s -> 679.11s]  Thanks for the tip. Nice. All right. Here we go. Let's begin. Let's check the movement first.
[679.11s -> 697.82s]  That's really important. Is that the? Oh, it's the dodge roll. Nice. Yeah, everyone said the game was
[697.82s -> 708.01s]  way harder, but the funny thing is, is this is like, this is 400 dodge frames. Is it? Where's the
[708.01s -> 715.58s]  dodge? All right. No, don't miss anything. Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to pay close attention.
[716.14s -> 723.48s]  Portamental letter. A letter thrown into a well. Kuro's wolf. Your destiny awaits you at the moon
[723.48s -> 730.12s]  view tower. Escape from the well and find the tower bathed in moonlight. Moonlit greatsword
[730.12s -> 735.08s]  will be at the base. Even without a blade, you can reach it, stay silent, stay vigilant.
[735.08s -> 748.95s]  So escape the well. Okay. First that you can swim in this game. I didn't just fall straight through
[748.95s -> 761.32s]  into the, out of the map. Interesting. Uh, that's new. So I could go this way or that way. Can I
[761.40s -> 776.98s]  dive? I wonder if there's a dive button. What's over here? I got to turn the lights off in my room.
[776.98s -> 789.13s]  That's important. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm in the menu now. Hold on. Now it's, it's one, it's one
[789.13s -> 796.74s]  third in the afternoon, but the lights are coming off. This game has actual menus, apparently. There
[796.74s -> 803.02s]  we go. Now I can see a little better. The equipment menu allows you to change your currently equipped
[803.02s -> 808.73s]  quick items. There are five slots available to equip and switch out quick items as needed, right?
[808.73s -> 815.69s]  Okay. So it's just like Dark Souls. You have this, these are your inventory slots or equipment slots.
[817.59s -> 822.55s]  Interesting. All right. Unseen aid, vitality, attack power. We only got, we only got two stats
[822.55s -> 829.32s]  in this whole game. Vitality and attack power. Items currently in possession can be viewed
[829.32s -> 836.58s]  through the inventory menu. Okay. So this is my items. There's the idle. Let's see. I'm going to
[836.58s -> 846.31s]  read. Okay. Let's see. No, no, no. Don't touch that. A small palm-sized wooden Buddha can be
[846.31s -> 852.15s]  used repeatedly held by the wolf. Ever since he was saved by his father, its corners are rounded
[852.15s -> 857.35s]  with use. This Buddha is used to return home. It will return the user to the last visited sculptor's
[857.35s -> 865.18s]  idol or dilapidated temple. And I can use this as many times as I want. So this is a homeward bone
[866.26s -> 884.23s]  with an infinite value. Really unlimited bone. Yeah. Okay. All right. So, um, am I missing
[884.23s -> 898.36s]  something over here? Did you wall jump? No, nothing here. Maybe there's something like over here
[898.36s -> 906.02s]  eventually. Is this just like Mario 64? It was made by the, uh, I think the same exact developer
[909.21s -> 914.70s]  from Nintendo. I was, I know that was not funny, but you know, look, I'm sick today.
[916.73s -> 921.45s]  That is really cool though. And you keep just having a jump in general that I don't have to
[921.45s -> 931.08s]  be sprinting and then press like the left thumbstick in. What? Okay. Yeah. Well, that's
[931.08s -> 939.69s]  jump in air near to do a wall jump. Don't even tell me that you can even feel like Spider-Man
[939.69s -> 948.89s]  in this game. No. I mean, yeah, kind of. Oh, I just want to go so slow. If I'm sorry, if you thought
[948.89s -> 952.09s]  this is going to be like a fast playthrough of a guy like, yeah, let me just get to like the first
[952.09s -> 959.03s]  boss now. No, no, no. I just, I want to look at everything. I want to experience the game very
[959.03s -> 968.39s]  slowly. What if I just died? Thank God there's no fall damage. Otherwise that would have been death
[968.39s -> 980.66s]  number one. I need a weapon. Also another thing that I need to change. I need to change the,
[982.28s -> 986.12s]  no, maybe not. I'll get used to it. All right. We can go backwards or we can go.
[990.79s -> 994.95s]  All right. I got to like relax. I haven't even played the game yet. Let's go this way first.
[994.95s -> 1008.09s]  No. Holy shit. Tug wall. You toggle it. Okay. I can go the other way. This is a shimmy.
[1012.78s -> 1017.37s]  You can peek around a corner. All right. Well, there's an enemy right there.
[1020.79s -> 1029.24s]  Stealth. Stealth. Advance without being seen by crouching in bushes or moving under floors.
[1031.21s -> 1036.01s]  You do not have a sword at the moment. You stealth to avoid enemies and head to the moon view tower.
[1036.81s -> 1042.17s]  You are about to be seen. Warning markers appear above enemy's heads. Oh man. This is a stealth
[1042.17s -> 1063.22s]  game. So, okay. Crouch. Well, you can see me. I'm in a bush. Okay. Let's just keep going.
[1064.68s -> 1071.67s]  Let's hang off the ledge. This feels like I shouldn't be able to do this.
[1079.03s -> 1095.67s]  Drop down. No, that's gonna kill me. Just let's go through the corn. Underfloor. Wolf can slip
[1095.67s -> 1107.53s]  into tight spaces such as beneath floors when crouched. You can go beneath floors. Like under
[1107.53s -> 1114.04s]  there. Okay. But what if I'm missing items? There's probably like an item I can go get over here.
[1114.04s -> 1145.22s]  Did I just do it? Oh, let me see. Because that's... Is there something else I can do?
[1148.30s -> 1152.54s]  No, I mean that's clearly going under the floor, but is there anything else I can do?
[1153.42s -> 1160.98s]  There's so many hidden fucking things in this game. No, I'm just gonna go.
[1166.09s -> 1189.32s]  I tried to do the infinite eye frame dodge. Died in the... Well, I'm just... I'm so conservative
[1189.32s -> 1196.34s]  of missing something. I'm just gonna go. Yeah, I'm just gonna go. Look, there's like an item over
[1196.34s -> 1208.36s]  there. I might go back. Am I never... Wait, am I never gonna be able to come back here again? Are
[1208.36s -> 1226.49s]  you sure? I figure this might have been a different way to go, but maybe not. There's nothing here.
[1226.49s -> 1254.15s]  All right, that's... I'm gonna call that strike one. The check is three strikes today. That was one
[1254.15s -> 1266.73s]  guy. No, I'm just gonna go. I'm just so happy that I get to play this right now. Under tight spaces.
[1267.29s -> 1277.74s]  That death doesn't count. All right, I got the eave drop there. Spider webs. Let's just go. So,
[1277.74s -> 1285.14s]  I'm assuming that's the tower, right? How much can I move without actually being seen, I wonder?
[1285.14s -> 1305.40s]  It's yellow and then it turns red, right? What about over here? No. Let's listen. Hole in the wall.
[1305.40s -> 1319.19s]  I mean, really. But you're not Sekiro. I'm Sekiro. I can do it easily. All right, so now...
[1320.15s -> 1328.86s]  Well, they got two... Oh, they face... Can I go down here? Can I just drop down there? I mean,
[1328.86s -> 1347.98s]  obviously, I have to go down there. I wonder how sensitive their hearing is. That's beautiful.
[1349.13s -> 1358.49s]  Oh, imagine living there. Jeremy never played a video game in his life. Elbertson. No, I just
[1358.49s -> 1362.49s]  don't know. In some stealth games, it's very sensitive. Their hearing or how close you get.
[1363.21s -> 1368.38s]  All right, I can jump this. I would have been very embarrassed if I died right there.
[1371.74s -> 1390.12s]  Uh, jump and in the air to ledge hang. Jump ledge hang. Is there a sprint? Okay, hold on.
[1390.12s -> 1394.81s]  There's a hole in the wall up here. Oh, there it is. Nothing else. What about a guy up there?
[1396.02s -> 1412.63s]  I don't see nothing. What about down here? No items. Oh, what does that mean? Not sturdy?
[1413.19s -> 1423.14s]  There's the hole facing the cliff. All right, I think we found our first character of the game.
[1423.78s -> 1444.95s]  Is this gonna alert enemies or something? No. First boss. Hey, no spoilers. That's strike two.
[1447.43s -> 1477.75s]  Even if it's incorrect. He just fucking flops me. Oh, that's a sword. Okay, I thought it was a pipe.
[1478.39s -> 1487.96s]  My shinobi, in accordance with the bond of lord and retainer,
[1489.98s -> 1497.78s]  you will I hereby welcome you to Sakura. Thanks for dying in the tutorial. But I was exploring
[1497.78s -> 1512.92s]  the controls. That doesn't count. As you command. The Kusa Bimaru, a katana given by Kuro, the divine
[1512.92s -> 1523.08s]  heir and heirloom of the Hirata family. A cadet branch descended from Ashino. Once thought lost,
[1523.08s -> 1528.92s]  it has found its way back into the hands of the wolf. The name Kusa Bimaru beseeches a shinobi's
[1528.92s -> 1534.76s]  role is to kill, but even a shinobi must not forget mercy. A mantra of the blade itself may manifest.
[1536.82s -> 1545.98s]  All right, weapon. All right, so this is the hub world. This is where I level up with my souls.
[1547.66s -> 1553.42s]  Loyal wolf, I see you are wounded. I have something that may help. Do you get it?
[1558.54s -> 1565.19s]  Okay, healing gourd. A gourd filled with vitality restoring medicine. Restoring, resting refills
[1565.19s -> 1571.99s]  the gourd. Okay. Made by an apprentice of the extraordinary Dr. Dogen. Though it is strange
[1571.99s -> 1576.63s]  that the gourd's medicinal waters refill automatically. The seeds within may hold the
[1576.63s -> 1581.27s]  secret to how it works. I could turn my mouse upside down because it's gonna keep doing that.
[1581.27s -> 1587.38s]  I'm gonna like put it on my desk and like upside down. Okay, so I have a estus kind of.
[1595.45s -> 1597.13s]  I'm not gonna change the audio to Spanish.
[1601.69s -> 1602.57s]  We got an escort mission.
[1608.65s -> 1616.17s]  I ask you to find that secret passage. Once you find it, signal me with a read whistle.
[1616.17s -> 1620.81s]  You got one of those? Like you used to long ago. I will join you as soon as I hear it.
[1622.63s -> 1626.15s]  All right, healing, using quick. You can cycle through various quick items to
[1626.15s -> 1630.63s]  and use each according to the situation, right? If you've taken damage, you can recover vitality
[1630.63s -> 1635.35s]  with the healing gourd. So use quick item and then cycle. Wait, so the use item is now up.
[1635.35s -> 1655.27s]  Oh, okay. I gotta actually put it on here though. Oh boy. I gotta change that. Yeah,
[1655.27s -> 1664.73s]  that's gonna screw with me the whole game. Let's go into binding here. So let's see.
[1666.94s -> 1677.43s]  Action is, this is action. There's a lot of, okay, use item. X is Y bound to anything?
[1678.65s -> 1683.10s]  Cycle prosthetic tool. Shit. I might have to get used to that.
[1683.90s -> 1692.23s]  Because drinking like the Estes is always that face button, whether it's square or X to me.
[1701.64s -> 1708.86s]  Somebody said rebind Y to up. Because that's a cycle prosthetic tool that's probably better
[1708.86s -> 1715.11s]  than Y, I would think. Use item, I'm going to say X and then action and collect loot, I'm going to
[1715.11s -> 1732.74s]  do Y. Because I will never ever get used to that. My muscle memory, my brain has different bindings
[1732.74s -> 1738.18s]  because of it. Yeah, but it doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. Hitting X to heal is
[1738.18s -> 1744.70s]  something I will never be able to not do. So then Y is now my interaction button, which that's fine.
[1744.70s -> 1752.65s]  That's getting the car in GTA, right? That's interact. I can do that. There's a secret passage
[1752.65s -> 1757.69s]  beneath the moat bridge that can take us out of the castle. Find the secret passage beneath the
[1757.69s -> 1763.61s]  moat bridge so that we may escape Ashina Castle. When you've reached it, give the signal. I'll come
[1764.25s -> 1767.21s]  as soon as I hear a good whistle. So let's, how do I refill the gourd?
[1768.41s -> 1779.75s]  Didn't tell me that one. Smartass. All right, let's go upstairs. Nice physics. Look at that. Item.
[1781.61s -> 1786.49s]  Pellet. Medicinal pellets that slowly restore vitality. A secret treatment passed down for
[1786.49s -> 1790.65s]  generations in these lands. Records say it has been used in battle since times long gone
[1791.21s -> 1798.01s]  and lent to the famed resilience of Ashina warriors. A pill case full of these pellets would also serve
[1798.01s -> 1809.77s]  as a battle charm. Oops, I just broke it. Okay. One pellet. Is this a chest? Let me look at that
[1809.77s -> 1831.45s]  again. So pellet. Slowly restore vitality. Vitality is a stat. Huh. Okay. So, but vitality is not
[1831.45s -> 1849.03s]  health. No, it is health. Okay. All right. Okay. I'm thinking too hard about it. Well, I'm just
[1849.03s -> 1855.21s]  basing every, all my knowledge on from software. I thought maybe it was something to help with,
[1856.09s -> 1865.98s]  like a status effect or something. All right, let's go. And here we go. I just, I just opened
[1865.98s -> 1871.51s]  up the gates to Yharnam. Posture and death blows. A shinobi aims to break an opponent's posture.
[1872.07s -> 1878.94s]  Attacking an enemy is one way to achieve this. When an enemy's posture breaks, he is vulnerable
[1878.94s -> 1885.91s]  to a shinobi death blow. So right trigger is, I mapped it to that. Right trigger after breaking
[1885.91s -> 1891.19s]  posture is a death blow. So that's kind of like a, a, like a parry into a death blow or a
[1891.75s -> 1898.76s]  visceral attack would be more towards Bloodborne, I would say. So breaking an opponent's posture.
[1902.36s -> 1906.68s]  Here we go. First enemy. Is there a two-handed or is it, is it only one-handed? How does this work?
[1910.52s -> 1917.03s]  Let's see what happens. Do I have a dodge? Okay. Oh, I got two people at the same time. Let's just,
[1917.03s -> 1936.09s]  let's go. Let's go. Oh yeah. That's posture, right? Okay. Oh, I see. That's a different bar.
[1938.26s -> 1950.54s]  It's a separate bar underneath the health. Whoa. All right. Well, uh, okay. So there's two,
[1950.54s -> 1953.98s]  there's a health bar and then a posture bar. Does stamina exist anymore?
[1954.86s -> 1975.16s]  Wait a minute. There's no stamina. Holy shit. That changes everything. Let me go take, uh,
[1975.16s -> 1991.05s]  nothing else over there, right? Wow. All right. That's so cool. Oh my God. Yes. All right. Let's
[1991.05s -> 2000.14s]  go. Come here. Wait. Sometimes relentless attack is not enough to break an enemy's posture.
[2000.86s -> 2006.22s]  Deflecting enemy attacks is another way to damage their posture. A master shinobi uses
[2006.22s -> 2013.06s]  a combination of deflect and attack to achieve swift victory. Left trigger the moment an attack
[2013.06s -> 2019.78s]  lands is deflect. Let's give it a try. Let me see what it looks like. Okay.
[2022.55s -> 2028.95s]  There it is. So then you go immediately into it. So it's not as much a parry as it is. Okay.
[2031.82s -> 2039.66s]  I get it. So you get to treat it as a, that actually, that feels really good actually.
[2040.38s -> 2048.97s]  That feels fucking great. I'm not going to lie. All right. Two guys that way. Let's go up here.
[2049.61s -> 2062.36s]  Anything hidden? No, that's just where I came from. I guess I think I have to go that way.
[2064.26s -> 2068.34s]  Lock on. Yeah. By locking on targets. Yeah. While locked in, you can change with, uh, R.
[2069.22s -> 2072.42s]  It's much easier to attack and deflect and perform other combat actions with people that are in
[2072.42s -> 2085.37s]  front of you. All right. I guess I'm just going to go in that door. Let's see if I can get some
[2085.37s -> 2095.05s]  perfect lock ons here. Perfect parries. That's so what is that? I got one of those bars too.
[2096.01s -> 2113.50s]  Perfect lock on. So I, this is on PC. PC with an Xbox one controller. Is there a sprint?
[2118.17s -> 2139.46s]  One. Oh, you can instantly kill people. You just insta kill. Oh, where is he? This is leader,
[2139.46s -> 2147.16s]  leader. What? This is a boss already? A counter slash can be performed immediately after
[2147.16s -> 2151.08s]  deflecting. Yeah. That's what I was doing. This allows you to deal posture damage without giving
[2151.08s -> 2174.01s]  the enemy time to recover. Counter slash. So it is just sword play, huh? Let's see if I can.
[2174.01s -> 2191.98s]  He's got a big long swing. So that's his posture up there. Some powerful opponents require multiple
[2191.98s -> 2197.46s]  death blows to be killed. The number of death blows required to kill an enemy is shown by the
[2197.46s -> 2206.20s]  red circular markers above their vitality bar. So you got to do a death blow to kill bosses. You got
[2206.20s -> 2238.58s]  it. Ooh, that hurt. Watch my posture. That hurt. Back it up, back it up, back it up. I don't want
[2238.58s -> 2257.56s]  to break. Whoa. My posture just got increased by a shit load right there. So if I hold down block,
[2257.56s -> 2273.88s]  my posture goes back to normal. Okay. Whoa. Oh, he's going to break my posture. Shit. Okay.
[2274.76s -> 2293.48s]  Who's going to break first? You. Oh no. Oh no. He's almost broken. Oh, don't treat it like Dark
[2293.48s -> 2326.95s]  Souls. Oh no. Wow. That's a, that's different. That's very different. So, all right. If your
[2326.95s -> 2339.10s]  posture breaks, then you can die, but you could break their posture as well. All right. I'm,
[2339.10s -> 2357.86s]  I'm starting to understand how this works. Well, I'm already right there. Is there stagger? I want
[2357.86s -> 2372.25s]  to help pick up a stagger. But I don't lose posture when I attack. Okay. There is a stagger.
[2374.52s -> 2379.56s]  All right. I see. I kick because you can do that little block at any time. I'm, I'm using it as,
[2380.44s -> 2386.23s]  I got to remove the Dark Souls from my brain because a parry in Dark Souls takes a few seconds.
[2386.23s -> 2417.88s]  You know what I mean? Do it again. Am I dead? What? I'm going down again. Okay. I'm starting
[2417.88s -> 2426.68s]  to figure out what I'm doing here. So once he gets to that red area, you got to hit him
[2426.68s -> 2434.84s]  another couple of times. So here's another pellet. Okay. Interesting, interesting, interesting stuff.
[2437.06s -> 2447.82s]  I'm not going to heal yet. Wait, what else is over here? You're going to say that 20 times an hour
[2447.82s -> 2452.46s]  for the next three days. You know, it's, I'm starting to figure it out. You know,
[2453.50s -> 2457.74s]  we've got first boss done. You know, I'm starting to figure it out. Interesting. The mechanics are
[2457.74s -> 2462.94s]  pretty cool. I'm just starting to figure out like kind of how that works. Three bosses down.
[2463.82s -> 2471.48s]  Cool mechanic, but I, I'm not sure I completely understand it yet. It's very fun though. 45
[2471.48s -> 2476.79s]  minutes from completing the game. Yeah. I think I'm really comfortable getting comfortable now,
[2476.79s -> 2488.20s]  maybe on a second play through. I feel like I can do something here. No, it's yeah. You're,
[2488.20s -> 2495.69s]  it's offense and defense at the same time, which is something that you're not used to. Ash gripped
[2495.69s -> 2503.69s]  into a hardened clump, throw it at an enemy to temporarily distract them. The snow falls thick
[2503.69s -> 2511.64s]  and thus the hearth runs thick with ash. So you can throw dust in somebody's eyes. All right.
[2511.64s -> 2527.50s]  Unless we got here this down. Should I go in? Oops. What about the doors that were just over here?
[2529.08s -> 2538.44s]  Let me go in the doors. Can I open this or can it not be opened? Like, oh, it doesn't. Here we go.
[2539.40s -> 2547.51s]  Cannot open from this side. You know what that means. That means fall down here and
[2547.51s -> 2554.79s]  no, it doesn't. I almost did that. You almost just left. All right. I'm going to go up there
[2554.79s -> 2564.98s]  actually under the bridge, right? That's the bridge. Let's see what's over this way.
[2566.84s -> 2582.23s]  Should I be still thing in air near wall, wall jump, and then hang on ledge? Yeah. What's that?
[2582.23s -> 2603.64s]  Oh, I can each run with it. It's guarded now. What's that thing? What is this little weirdo
[2603.64s -> 2617.40s]  that's just sitting here digging? Uh, this is an, it's an enemy. What do I do about this?
[2618.12s -> 2642.17s]  What the fuck? Okay. Near edge. Um, who was that? I don't know who that person even was
[2642.17s -> 2661.02s]  or why they were here. It's the egg. Is this going to kill me? Oh, an item. Look. Oh, look at that.
[2661.02s -> 2672.22s]  What is it? Pellets. I should probably put these on the heart bar and the ash here too. So pellets
[2672.22s -> 2682.25s]  heal. All right. Oh, you got more rocks. Let me just take a gander across the way and make sure
[2682.25s -> 2691.48s]  I didn't miss anything. I mean this shit over there, but fuck it. Let's just go the way we're
[2691.48s -> 2708.30s]  going. Uh, any enemies? There's going to be something down here, right? Like right here.
[2710.04s -> 2724.04s]  No. What is this? Nothing. This appears to be at the escape route called the divine air with the
[2724.04s -> 2727.00s]  no, I found it. Okay. Hold on. No, no, no, no, not yet. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2728.60s -> 2732.20s]  Is there something else I can grab or do? Is this death? If I fall down this?
[2736.36s -> 2755.85s]  Hold on. You can't grab that. All right. Well, can I, hopefully I can grab this again. I need,
[2755.85s -> 2768.44s]  I need to know. Oh, it's not water. What the fuck is that? Okay. It's just a lizard.
[2773.43s -> 2776.39s]  Oh my God. That wasn't even, I don't even know if that was hostile.
[2777.35s -> 2793.69s]  I don't even know if that enemy was hostile. I'm sorry. I'm coughing. Anything else?
[2793.69s -> 2804.41s]  Yeah. I don't think I, I don't, I don't need to be doing that, but I'm going to, I don't want to just
[2805.58s -> 2809.26s]  blow through that part. Let me look up here. I feel like it's probably another pellet or something.
[2810.94s -> 2839.16s]  Maybe, maybe not. No, no, I can go here. Nothing else, right? No, not really. Just want to look.
[2839.88s -> 2864.81s]  No, I think we're good. I think we're good to go. Nothing else over here. That much of a fall might
[2864.81s -> 2881.05s]  kill you though. Still in the canyon. Oh, I'm taking my sweet ass time. You better believe it.
[2881.05s -> 2895.14s]  Although I might have to go all the way around again. Yeah. Well, at least I got to see the
[2895.14s -> 2908.18s]  lizard, right? You're supposed to ride the geckos. I don't know if I believe that, but
[2915.14s -> 2924.04s]  jumping around is really fun though. Here leads us to this ledge, which can I make a jump from here?
[2924.92s -> 2929.40s]  Oh my God. What just happened? All right. Well, that's, that's actually a really good thing
[2929.40s -> 2934.04s]  because I was almost just drinking that Estus because I pressed, my brain was pressing X.
[2935.29s -> 2952.71s]  Instead of Y. Okay, let's go. I should be able to get them from here. That looks good. Although,
[2953.43s -> 2970.79s]  what about over there? Oh shit, hold on. I think I, a shit load of money just came in.
[2971.43s -> 2978.33s]  We just gave 50 fucking dollars. Let me see what was. Oh, my mouse is up here, right?
[2979.29s -> 2990.23s]  Ow. Uh, Katz Beanie, thanks for 50 bucks. Thank you so much, Katz Beanie. 5000 bits.
[2991.22s -> 2994.42s]  There's a lot I would like to say to you, Jerm, but I just keep it, Jerma short.
[2995.14s -> 2998.50s]  I love your VR streams and your Dark Souls streams. I'm always happy to watch you stream
[2998.50s -> 3006.63s]  and thank you for being yourself. Uh, that's, that's really fucking kind of you. If you like
[3006.63s -> 3010.15s]  the Dark Souls streams, then you probably like this one too, because this is by the same company.
[3010.87s -> 3016.66s]  Thank you for your extreme generosity. You have 50 dollars. It means a lot.
[3017.46s -> 3034.94s]  Much love to you. Thanks for sticking around. 5000 bits. There's nothing I can do here. That
[3034.94s -> 3056.89s]  was Katz Beanie, by the way. All right. Blow the whistle. Are we in E mode only? What's going on
[3056.89s -> 3062.36s]  with chat today? Is it because it's Sekiro? People just lose their minds over a game like this?
[3062.36s -> 3079.46s]  You found it. Now, let us leave this place. Yes, my lord. To think that this is the only way
[3079.46s -> 3089.54s]  to run from the faded bloodline is the answer. No, is, are we in escort quest?
[3091.26s -> 3097.88s]  Escort quest territory. Get the mouse off the screen. There we go. All right.
[3100.76s -> 3101.24s]  Run away.
[3106.44s -> 3107.24s]  I didn't even mean to do that. I'm sorry.
[3116.84s -> 3122.17s]  All right. If I walked back out there, it was like jumping up on walls again. Hey,
[3122.17s -> 3130.82s]  let me just check the verticality of the game. See how it is. All right. That looks cool.
[3133.18s -> 3158.70s]  Where's the note that says welcome? Get good, right? Last we stood together was your uncle's
[3158.70s -> 3177.35s]  funeral. Lord Genichiro. Genichiro. I'll just hand the sword. Hey, you take this. You try.
[3177.99s -> 3198.86s]  It's like we have two lives. You can't beat him. I'll give it a go. Oh boy. One v one.
[3200.94s -> 3205.72s]  Is it going to have a huge boss bar underneath at the bottom? I hope so.
[3208.76s -> 3213.32s]  Uh, not necessarily. Oh God. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I didn't heal
[3213.32s -> 3223.05s]  yet. I didn't heal. I need to heal first. All right. Let's do it. So let's tap, tap.
[3225.91s -> 3245.74s]  What the hell was that? That little like, what the fuck does that mean? I am so confused.
[3246.38s -> 3264.54s]  I gotta back up. What the fuck? Why am I getting like a Batman indicator?
[3274.06s -> 3279.34s]  What the? Oh, I think, oh, that's supposed to happen.
[3282.79s -> 3295.83s]  That's how you become Sekiro. He turns and he says to the kid, it should have been you.
[3297.08s -> 3308.46s]  Is that all the Shinobi? The divine air will be coming with me. You were supposed to go first.
[3309.26s -> 3321.88s]  I would have seen the Batman indicators and then I would have fucking ran.
[3322.52s -> 3339.72s]  We're about to see, this is the E3 teaser. I thought he was doing that to his leg.
[3340.20s -> 3366.30s]  Oh, pale blood, you say? No matter. Just think it all and be a bad dream.
[3367.26s -> 3393.80s]  Don't mind the beeps. I'm just going to mute. Looks like death is not your fate just yet.
[3408.10s -> 3415.27s]  All right. The Shinobi prosthetic, the artificial arm of a Shinobi passed down by the sculptor,
[3416.07s -> 3419.19s]  a replica of a human arm fitted with a variety of mechanisms,
[3419.27s -> 3422.87s]  apparently designed with a modification in mind, with modification in mind.
[3423.69s -> 3427.53s]  Well, if there is a number of cuts and is stained thick with blood and oil,
[3427.53s -> 3433.38s]  it has been impeccably maintained. Interesting. Okay.
[3435.86s -> 3444.95s]  What do you call yourself? The eyes of a wolf who has failed in his duties.
[3445.75s -> 3449.51s]  Or so it seems to me. That is not your concern.
[3450.65s -> 3454.25s]  Spoken like a true Shinobi. This dude is huge.
[3460.28s -> 3463.40s]  Dialogue options of how you got here. Ask about your new arm. How'd you get here?
[3463.40s -> 3467.72s]  What am I here? All I did was drag you here.
[3467.72s -> 3475.42s]  Didn't even know if I was dragging a corpse. Go get eaten, vile dogs.
[3475.42s -> 3482.46s]  When was I asleep? Some time has passed since I found you.
[3482.46s -> 3485.50s]  I see. However, your master,
[3485.66s -> 3491.02s]  yet lives. He's being held prisoner in Ashina Castle.
[3491.02s -> 3494.70s]  They will soon make use of his bloodline. I wonder if this is the hub.
[3494.70s -> 3499.10s]  Looking at you, I'm sure you appreciate the value it has.
[3500.22s -> 3505.70s]  Okay. Ask about your bloodline. What did you mean when you said they'll
[3505.70s -> 3509.86s]  make use of his bloodline? I don't know much about him,
[3509.86s -> 3516.18s]  except the dragon's heritage. There's a special kind of blood by that name,
[3516.18s -> 3520.18s]  and that blood runs through your master's veins.
[3520.18s -> 3523.38s]  Of the Divine Heir? Someone's after him.
[3523.38s -> 3527.22s]  Might be that the strange things happening to your body
[3527.22s -> 3531.54s]  have something to do with that. All right.
[3531.54s -> 3535.40s]  Might as well ask. What did you do to me?
[3535.40s -> 3541.40s]  That is what I call the Shinobi Prosthetic. A fitting fang for a one-armed wolf.
[3541.40s -> 3544.20s]  You're getting to where I have where I reached. Gonna beat the game myself.
[3544.28s -> 3549.16s]  See you later, Teramo. See you later, Pat. Enjoy the game.
[3549.16s -> 3554.17s]  It seems really fucking cool.
[3554.17s -> 3558.79s]  Any Shinobi tools. Shinobi tools.
[3558.79s -> 3564.71s]  I see this device. You catch on quick.
[3564.71s -> 3567.83s]  So this is kind of like a blacksmith. If you give me Shinobi tools,
[3567.83s -> 3575.80s]  I'll find a way to Shinobi Prosthetic. I appreciate its worth.
[3575.80s -> 3584.84s]  I've said too much. Go now. You're quite the strange one.
[3584.84s -> 3587.88s]  Huge amount of money just came in again.
[3587.88s -> 3589.88s]  Other peculiar visitors have come to this temple.
[3589.88s -> 3591.88s]  Oh, let me just get to the end of the sequence.
[3591.88s -> 3593.88s]  There's one in the clearing to the right of the gate,
[3593.88s -> 3595.88s]  leading off the temple grounds.
[3595.88s -> 3597.88s]  Two strangers in strange circumstances.
[3597.88s -> 3599.88s]  To the right of the gate, okay.
[3599.88s -> 3603.66s]  You too might get alarmed.
[3603.66s -> 3606.28s]  All right, so I got the Shinobi Prosthetic.
[3606.28s -> 3608.52s]  Hold on one sec.
[3608.52s -> 3610.52s]  I don't know why this keeps doing this.
[3610.52s -> 3612.52s]  There we go. That's better.
[3616.62s -> 3618.62s]  Juno Upsetto gave $50.
[3618.62s -> 3621.05s]  Thank you so much Juno Upsetto.
[3621.05s -> 3628.38s]  Two very, very large monetary contributions back to back here within 10 minutes.
[3628.38s -> 3632.38s]  So, that's a fucking lot. Thanks guys.
[3632.38s -> 3637.19s]  Juno, you say, you say, I've been under the weather recently.
[3637.19s -> 3639.19s]  Guess it couldn't help to spread a bit of positivity.
[3639.19s -> 3641.82s]  Love you guys. Jerma Heart.
[3641.82s -> 3643.82s]  Hell yeah, thank you. Sorry you're not feeling well.
[3643.82s -> 3645.82s]  Neither am I.
[3645.82s -> 3647.82s]  Unfortunately, I don't know why it seems whenever I get sick
[3648.54s -> 3650.54s]  or you guys get sick, I get sick too. It's weird.
[3650.54s -> 3653.93s]  But, welcome to the hub world.
[3653.93s -> 3655.93s]  This is probably what this is.
[3655.93s -> 3657.93s]  I'd be surprised if it wasn't.
[3657.93s -> 3660.62s]  On Sculptor's Idol.
[3660.62s -> 3666.57s]  Commune. Commune with Sculptor's Idol.
[3666.57s -> 3670.57s]  Sculptor's Idol serve as a checkpoint and can be found throughout the area.
[3670.57s -> 3673.83s]  It's like a bonfire.
[3673.83s -> 3675.83s]  Completely replenish vitality and restore one's
[3675.83s -> 3677.83s]  one use of resurrection.
[3677.83s -> 3683.16s]  One use of, additionally quick items and spirit emblems in storage
[3683.88s -> 3686.06s]  would be added to your current inventory.
[3686.06s -> 3688.06s]  With some exceptions, resting will also revive defeated enemies.
[3688.06s -> 3692.52s]  Uh, okay.
[3692.52s -> 3694.52s]  So, I get, I get, I get, I get.
[3694.52s -> 3697.14s]  Resurrection. Unseen aid.
[3697.14s -> 3704.12s]  30%.
[3704.12s -> 3708.14s]  My, my god.
[3708.14s -> 3710.14s]  Shadows die twice. Yeah, that makes sense.
[3710.14s -> 3713.78s]  Uh, um, what, what have you done?
[3713.78s -> 3717.78s]  Die, die 335.
[3717.78s -> 3719.78s]  That's 225.
[3719.78s -> 3726.82s]  That is an uncountable amount of damage.
[3727.54s -> 3729.54s]  That is an uncountable amount of money.
[3729.54s -> 3731.54s]  Thank you for the 225 bucks.
[3731.54s -> 3735.54s]  They say, don't know what to say, but here, laughing my ass off, take it.
[3738.15s -> 3740.46s]  Okay.
[3740.46s -> 3746.09s]  I guess I'll take it.
[3746.09s -> 3748.78s]  That's a fucking ridiculous amount of money, die.
[3748.78s -> 3751.08s]  Thank you.
[3751.08s -> 3753.26s]  Holy shit.
[3753.26s -> 3755.26s]  Streamer can't count to 225.
[3755.26s -> 3757.26s]  Well, I can, but that's uncountable.
[3757.26s -> 3763.51s]  Another NPC coming in here.
[3763.51s -> 3765.69s]  Jesus.
[3767.69s -> 3769.69s]  No, it isn't. It's uncountable.
[3774.91s -> 3776.91s]  But thank you, die.
[3776.91s -> 3778.91s]  My god.
[3778.91s -> 3780.91s]  That's fucking insane.
[3792.42s -> 3794.42s]  Okay, so what does she do?
[3795.14s -> 3797.14s]  Oh.
[3805.14s -> 3808.72s]  You got any more of them?
[3808.72s -> 3815.15s]  Is it weird that anytime somebody says that I'm a doctor, I don't believe them.
[3815.15s -> 3818.42s]  I just got, trust me, I'm a doctored.
[3828.42s -> 3832.42s]  The medicinal waters in this gourd spring forth on their own.
[3832.42s -> 3837.42s]  Even after being emptied, you will find it full again after a short rest.
[3837.42s -> 3839.42s]  Yes.
[3839.42s -> 3841.42s]  Is there a way to improve it?
[3841.42s -> 3843.42s]  Bring me gourd seeds.
[3843.42s -> 3845.42s]  Gourd seeds?
[3845.42s -> 3847.42s]  Yes, medicinal waters grow from gourd seeds.
[3847.42s -> 3852.42s]  Adding new seeds will increase the volume of these medicinal waters.
[3852.42s -> 3854.42s]  If you find any, bring them to me.
[3855.14s -> 3857.89s]  Alright.
[3857.89s -> 3859.89s]  Okay, do I have one?
[3859.89s -> 3863.86s]  Oh, I don't have any.
[3863.86s -> 3865.86s]  Hold on, what else do you got?
[3865.86s -> 3868.42s]  I'm glad you've come. I'd like to make a request.
[3868.42s -> 3870.66s]  Request?
[3870.66s -> 3872.66s]  Please show me your face.
[3872.66s -> 3876.82s]  What?
[3876.82s -> 3878.82s]  This white mark.
[3878.82s -> 3880.82s]  Is it a birthmark?
[3880.82s -> 3882.82s]  No.
[3882.82s -> 3884.82s]  That's a correct reaction.
[3884.82s -> 3886.82s]  What?
[3887.54s -> 3893.84s]  I have to show my face again.
[3901.84s -> 3904.02s]  Okay, anything else?
[3908.86s -> 3910.86s]  Receive the dragon's heritage.
[3915.16s -> 3917.34s]  Hmm.
[3917.34s -> 3919.34s]  Hmm.
[3921.26s -> 3924.39s]  Oh, yes.
[3924.39s -> 3929.38s]  Okay, just making sure there's nothing else?
[3929.38s -> 3932.56s]  Yes, right. That don't do anything funny.
[3932.56s -> 3934.56s]  Yeah, I won't.
[3934.56s -> 3940.30s]  Alright, so we've got our place of rest right here.
[3940.30s -> 3943.30s]  And then we can go this way, or we can go that way.
[3943.30s -> 3946.30s]  Now, the question is, which way is correct?
[3946.30s -> 3950.40s]  Grappling hook.
[3950.40s -> 3955.40s]  The shinobi prosthetic grappling hook allows access to normally unreachable places and a chance to take the high ground.
[3957.45s -> 3961.45s]  Nearby grapple points are designated with a circular symbol.
[3961.45s -> 3964.45s]  When this symbol turns green, the grapple point is within reach.
[3964.45s -> 3970.78s]  And I've got a left bumper.
[3970.78s -> 3972.78s]  That's so cool. Hold on.
[3972.78s -> 3977.65s]  Let's just take a look.
[3977.65s -> 3989.92s]  Might as well try it.
[3989.92s -> 3991.92s]  Well, that's awesome. Can I do it?
[3991.92s -> 3994.35s]  Does it have to have an indicator there, or can I just do it whenever?
[3994.35s -> 3996.35s]  I guess I can just do it.
[3996.35s -> 3998.35s]  Okay, this is Ashina Outskirts.
[3998.35s -> 4005.82s]  I wonder if this is where I need to be.
[4005.82s -> 4007.82s]  Maybe.
[4008.54s -> 4013.22s]  Sculptor's Idol travel.
[4013.22s -> 4017.22s]  You can now instantly travel between Sculptor's Idols that have already been communed with.
[4017.22s -> 4020.65s]  Travel can be accessed via the Sculptor's Idol travel menu.
[4020.65s -> 4026.86s]  So, any of them.
[4026.86s -> 4028.86s]  So, okay, that's good.
[4028.86s -> 4030.86s]  This goes to important places.
[4030.86s -> 4034.16s]  So this is the, yeah, Outskirts.
[4034.16s -> 4036.59s]  There's the dilapidated temple.
[4036.59s -> 4039.59s]  This is the temple, and the Outskirts is really all I have.
[4039.59s -> 4042.83s]  I love how important places is here.
[4042.83s -> 4044.83s]  Alright, so we've got a bonfire.
[4045.92s -> 4048.67s]  Let us...let's just go.
[4048.67s -> 4055.89s]  Can I grapple that?
[4055.89s -> 4060.82s]  What about down there?
[4060.82s -> 4062.82s]  Can I make that? If I jump and grapple, am I gonna die?
[4062.82s -> 4065.94s]  I need to test.
[4065.94s -> 4071.25s]  Should I test it?
[4071.25s -> 4082.06s]  No, you can't! You can't, Spider-Man!
[4082.06s -> 4091.41s]  It was worth a try.
[4091.41s -> 4093.71s]  I didn't die, though, somehow.
[4093.71s -> 4095.71s]  There's definitely something I can do over there.
[4095.71s -> 4097.71s]  But, for the sake of progress, let's just see what happens.
[4097.71s -> 4102.26s]  Go this way.
[4102.26s -> 4104.26s]  Uh, I can go to the building here.
[4104.26s -> 4106.82s]  This is too much freedom!
[4107.54s -> 4110.08s]  Oh, I could just go that way.
[4110.08s -> 4112.08s]  What about this guy?
[4112.08s -> 4114.08s]  Stealth deathblow.
[4114.08s -> 4116.08s]  You can perform stealth deathblows on opponents unaware of your presence.
[4116.08s -> 4120.94s]  So you can Batman people.
[4120.94s -> 4124.94s]  So the plunging deathblow is one of these performed when leaping at an unaware enemy from the high ground.
[4124.94s -> 4126.94s]  So you jump and then swing.
[4126.94s -> 4128.94s]  Once you are locked on.
[4128.94s -> 4130.94s]  Let's try it.
[4130.94s -> 4136.77s]  Awesome.
[4136.77s -> 4139.07s]  And then there's loot. Enemies drop loot such as items and money.
[4139.07s -> 4141.07s]  Multiple enemies can be looted at once.
[4141.07s -> 4143.07s]  Really.
[4143.07s -> 4145.57s]  And from a distance away.
[4145.57s -> 4147.57s]  Items found in the world are different than loot in that they must be approached to be picked up.
[4147.57s -> 4149.57s]  Press and hold Y to acquire loot.
[4149.57s -> 4151.57s]  Press Y near world item to pick up.
[4151.57s -> 4153.57s]  So there's just like a money grabber.
[4153.57s -> 4156.90s]  Interesting.
[4156.90s -> 4158.90s]  Some pellets.
[4158.90s -> 4162.91s]  And you can only have three of these, alright?
[4162.91s -> 4165.15s]  Alright, what about down here?
[4165.15s -> 4168.86s]  Let's go...
[4168.86s -> 4171.55s]  Nothing.
[4171.55s -> 4173.55s]  I'm gonna go across that bridge, though.
[4173.55s -> 4178.66s]  Can I make that jump?
[4178.66s -> 4180.66s]  Come on. I can grab that from here.
[4180.66s -> 4182.66s]  Really?
[4182.66s -> 4190.53s]  Come on.
[4190.53s -> 4194.56s]  You can go up, down, around.
[4194.56s -> 4196.56s]  One could get lost simply just doing basic tasks right now.
[4196.56s -> 4207.38s]  Ceramic shard.
[4207.38s -> 4210.51s]  A piece of pottery that breaks with a satisfying crack.
[4210.51s -> 4212.51s]  Throw it at an enemy to draw their attention.
[4212.51s -> 4214.51s]  I feel like for the stealth portion of this game, some of this stuff is gonna be fairly important.
[4214.51s -> 4219.44s]  And why would they give that to me right now?
[4219.44s -> 4221.44s]  Okay.
[4221.44s -> 4224.32s]  I was gonna say.
[4224.32s -> 4226.32s]  Wait a minute.
[4226.32s -> 4228.32s]  Can I just do this?
[4228.32s -> 4230.82s]  Can I just do this?
[4230.82s -> 4238.35s]  Fuck.
[4238.35s -> 4240.35s]  I'm trying to jump down.
[4240.35s -> 4242.72s]  You know what I was trying to do.
[4242.72s -> 4245.28s]  He jumped backwards.
[4245.28s -> 4250.14s]  What a pro.
[4250.14s -> 4252.96s]  Alright, let's go.
[4252.96s -> 4259.81s]  Fuck this, man.
[4259.81s -> 4261.81s]  Just go up here and drop down on somebody.
[4261.81s -> 4272.82s]  Whoa!
[4272.82s -> 4277.68s]  You are just flurrying right now.
[4277.68s -> 4279.92s]  I wanna get that guy from jumping down.
[4279.92s -> 4281.92s]  Wait. Grab the items. Very important.
[4281.92s -> 4284.61s]  It's a huge jump when you jump off of one of those ledges.
[4284.61s -> 4286.61s]  You launch.
[4286.61s -> 4290.38s]  You launch.
[4290.38s -> 4292.88s]  Let's get this guy.
[4292.88s -> 4301.90s]  So this is a currency.
[4301.90s -> 4304.46s]  Odd.
[4304.46s -> 4306.46s]  There is some sort of currency thing.
[4306.46s -> 4313.10s]  What?
[4313.10s -> 4317.58s]  Okay. I thought I was gonna fall.
[4317.58s -> 4319.82s]  Alright.
[4319.82s -> 4321.82s]  Oh my god, guys.
[4321.82s -> 4323.82s]  Oh my god.
[4325.82s -> 4329.73s]  This is so much money.
[4329.73s -> 4331.73s]  Oh fuck, there's a guy right here.
[4331.73s -> 4335.38s]  Can I stealth kill him?
[4335.38s -> 4339.15s]  Can anybody see this?
[4339.15s -> 4341.63s]  No. Alright, hold on.
[4341.63s -> 4343.63s]  GuyDude
[4343.63s -> 4345.63s]  GuyDudeSM
[4345.63s -> 4348.19s]  or GuyDudesm
[4348.19s -> 4350.56s]  just gave a $250
[4350.56s -> 4352.56s]  on top of the $225
[4352.56s -> 4354.86s]  that Dai gave earlier.
[4354.86s -> 4357.68s]  Oh my god, guys.
[4357.68s -> 4359.68s]  Thank you, Guy. GuyDude.
[4359.68s -> 4361.68s]  Hey there. Not much to say. Just want to donate to probably the only streamer
[4361.68s -> 4363.68s]  or YouTuber I watch nowadays.
[4363.68s -> 4365.68s]  Thanks for being a big inspiration.
[4365.68s -> 4369.46s]  UWU.
[4369.46s -> 4371.46s]  I don't even know how much money that was.
[4371.46s -> 4373.46s]  It's uncountable. Anything over $225?
[4373.46s -> 4376.91s]  But holy shit, guys. Seriously.
[4376.91s -> 4378.91s]  Thank you, GuyDude, for the $250 fucking dollars.
[4378.91s -> 4382.88s]  What an insane amount of money
[4382.88s -> 4384.88s]  to receive in one second.
[4384.88s -> 4388.08s]  My goodness.
[4388.08s -> 4393.82s]  Hold on.
[4393.82s -> 4395.82s]  I only have $225 fingers.
[4395.82s -> 4397.82s]  Alright, what about this guy? Is that a...
[4397.82s -> 4400.75s]  What if I just surprise this dude?
[4400.75s -> 4404.40s]  Ready? Watch this.
[4404.40s -> 4412.53s]  Oh, he has a gun.
[4412.53s -> 4415.54s]  Bullets and...
[4415.54s -> 4417.54s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Who's here?
[4417.54s -> 4419.97s]  AshGryptant? Yeah, I know what that is.
[4419.97s -> 4421.97s]  I can deflect bullets,
[4421.97s -> 4423.97s]  but more importantly...
[4423.97s -> 4435.34s]  That was actually kind of scary.
[4435.34s -> 4438.74s]  There's an item over here that I missed.
[4438.74s -> 4441.04s]  So how do you deflect a bullet?
[4441.04s -> 4448.40s]  Ungo Sugar.
[4448.40s -> 4450.40s]  Sugar candy made in Sun Phao temple.
[4450.40s -> 4452.40s]  Sustaining Ungo's blessing.
[4452.40s -> 4454.40s]  Temporarily reduces vitality damage
[4454.40s -> 4456.40s]  taken from physical attacks.
[4456.40s -> 4458.40s]  Bite the candy
[4458.40s -> 4460.40s]  and take the Ungo stance
[4460.40s -> 4464.40s]  to impart its inhuman benediction.
[4464.40s -> 4466.70s]  By doing so, you endure the excess karma
[4466.70s -> 4468.70s]  of man from the spirits within.
[4468.70s -> 4470.70s]  They spread this candy across Ashina
[4470.70s -> 4472.70s]  so it's like a defense candy.
[4472.70s -> 4474.70s]  I wonder how long it lasts for.
[4474.70s -> 4481.36s]  I've got so many items.
[4481.36s -> 4483.73s]  I wanted to take a look up here.
[4483.73s -> 4489.87s]  Let's get up there.
[4489.87s -> 4493.71s]  And up this way.
[4493.71s -> 4501.07s]  You can just climb on houses.
[4501.07s -> 4503.07s]  Ah, I see an item.
[4503.07s -> 4505.44s]  Item that I missed over here.
[4505.44s -> 4512.93s]  More sugar.
[4512.93s -> 4519.06s]  Cool, alright, let's go.
[4519.06s -> 4521.81s]  You can, Spider-Man.
[4521.81s -> 4523.81s]  You just have to be close enough.
[4523.81s -> 4534.11s]  Oops, that's not death, right?
[4534.11s -> 4541.22s]  No, it's not.
[4541.22s -> 4544.74s]  Can I get up there?
[4544.74s -> 4550.43s]  Is there anything on top of this house?
[4550.43s -> 4552.43s]  Don't fall.
[4552.43s -> 4560.10s]  That's not another
[4560.10s -> 4562.10s]  50 plus dollar donation, right?
[4562.10s -> 4565.17s]  There's not much else I can do up here.
[4565.17s -> 4567.17s]  It is.
[4567.17s -> 4569.73s]  The Reno just gave 50 dollars too.
[4569.73s -> 4571.73s]  I'm going to stop playing because I'm a bad gamer
[4571.73s -> 4573.73s]  and was starting to rage.
[4573.73s -> 4575.73s]  Can't wait to watch this happen to you.
[4575.73s -> 4577.73s]  Anyway, I'm enjoying the stream thus far.
[4577.73s -> 4581.25s]  Good luck. Thank you so much, Reno.
[4581.25s -> 4583.25s]  I am ready to
[4583.25s -> 4585.25s]  get absolutely fucking shit on.
[4585.25s -> 4588.96s]  But I'm taking my time.
[4588.96s -> 4590.96s]  I don't want to just blow through it.
[4590.96s -> 4593.26s]  I really appreciate
[4593.26s -> 4598.58s]  the 50 dollars
[4598.58s -> 4600.58s]  on top of all the other money that has come in.
[4600.58s -> 4603.65s]  You guys are too much.
[4603.65s -> 4605.65s]  Alright, dog. This is a soul staple.
[4605.65s -> 4613.26s]  Now I'm going to deal with the dog.
[4613.26s -> 4615.26s]  Let's deal with the dog like this.
[4615.26s -> 4617.89s]  Oh fuck.
[4617.89s -> 4620.19s]  He's dead?
[4620.19s -> 4624.53s]  Oh shit.
[4624.53s -> 4626.53s]  The dog
[4626.53s -> 4628.53s]  I killed the dog in one hit.
[4628.53s -> 4642.27s]  Is that a checkpoint?
[4642.27s -> 4647.82s]  Wow.
[4647.82s -> 4650.06s]  Alright, cool.
[4650.06s -> 4655.04s]  Dog down.
[4655.04s -> 4657.04s]  Why can I grab that? I'm getting the checkpoint first.
[4657.04s -> 4659.54s]  Bonfire found.
[4659.54s -> 4665.94s]  Sculptor's idol found.
[4665.94s -> 4671.06s]  Crest.
[4671.06s -> 4673.06s]  Travel.
[4673.06s -> 4675.06s]  Can you travel to every single one?
[4675.06s -> 4677.06s]  Yeah, you can.
[4677.06s -> 4683.52s]  So this is the gate path.
[4683.52s -> 4686.59s]  Let's get the idol.
[4686.59s -> 4688.59s]  Another ceramic shard. Who's this?
[4688.59s -> 4691.02s]  It's a dog.
[4691.02s -> 4693.02s]  Oh right, right, right.
[4693.02s -> 4695.02s]  I respawned the enemies.
[4695.02s -> 4697.02s]  Oh shit.
[4697.02s -> 4699.02s]  I'm forgetting the most important mechanic
[4699.02s -> 4701.02s]  in any of these games?
[4701.02s -> 4703.39s]  Really?
[4703.39s -> 4705.39s]  Of all the things to screw up.
[4705.39s -> 4707.39s]  Oh my god.
[4707.39s -> 4713.02s]  What an idiot.
[4713.02s -> 4723.58s]  Hmm. Let me think.
[4723.58s -> 4725.58s]  Name two things that happen in every
[4725.58s -> 4728.08s]  souls game.
[4728.08s -> 4730.08s]  You die and enemies respawn.
[4730.08s -> 4735.78s]  Oh. I'm not going to make that mistake again.
[4735.78s -> 4745.57s]  Dogs can't even get up here.
[4745.57s -> 4755.30s]  Who cares? Who's this?
[4755.30s -> 4757.30s]  Uhhhh.
[4757.30s -> 4761.26s]  A mechanical device made by
[4761.26s -> 4763.26s]  the mechanical genius Dogen.
[4763.26s -> 4765.26s]  Can be fit into the shinobi prosthetic
[4765.26s -> 4767.26s]  to become a working tool.
[4767.26s -> 4770.08s]  I know exactly what I'm doing.
[4770.08s -> 4772.08s]  As well as palm sides, a surprising number of
[4772.08s -> 4774.08s]  shuriken can fit into the shuriken wheel.
[4774.08s -> 4776.08s]  As the edges were designed for stacking,
[4776.08s -> 4778.08s]  find example of what can be achieved
[4778.08s -> 4780.08s]  when one matches mechanical finesse with a shinobi's
[4780.08s -> 4782.08s]  talent. So I got a
[4782.08s -> 4786.18s]  part. They can't be used on their own
[4786.18s -> 4788.18s]  by giving them to the sculptor. They can be
[4788.18s -> 4790.18s]  fitted into the prosthetic. You can quickly return
[4790.18s -> 4792.18s]  to the sculptor via travel from a sculptor's idol
[4792.18s -> 4794.18s]  or use the homeward bone.
[4794.18s -> 4797.10s]  Interesting.
[4797.10s -> 4799.47s]  Let's just go put it in now.
[4799.47s -> 4801.47s]  I feel like I need to do that now. I have an upgrade
[4801.47s -> 4803.47s]  mechanic. Might as well
[4803.47s -> 4810.19s]  use it.
[4810.19s -> 4812.37s]  Get up there.
[4812.37s -> 4814.37s]  Get up on top. Thank you.
[4814.37s -> 4823.90s]  Fucking consumerism.
[4823.90s -> 4831.12s]  What?
[4831.12s -> 4834.96s]  I got something for you. Fucking consumerism.
[4834.96s -> 4836.96s]  I don't even know where that came from. Why did I
[4836.96s -> 4838.96s]  read that?
[4846.96s -> 4848.96s]  I don't know why I read that.
[4871.47s -> 4873.90s]  Seems you know this prosthetic
[4873.90s -> 4875.90s]  very well.
[4875.90s -> 4877.90s]  It used to be mine.
[4879.90s -> 4881.90s]  The more demonic my sculptures
[4881.90s -> 4883.90s]  will become, give it here.
[4883.90s -> 4885.90s]  I'll fit that tool
[4885.90s -> 4892.18s]  for you.
[4892.18s -> 4895.25s]  Fit new tool.
[4895.25s -> 4897.25s]  There's a little menu here.
[4897.25s -> 4900.26s]  Regular shinobi tools found in the world
[4900.26s -> 4902.26s]  can be specifically adapted to the shinobi
[4902.26s -> 4904.26s]  prosthetic with the fit prosthetic
[4904.26s -> 4908.42s]  tool.
[4908.42s -> 4910.91s]  So loaded
[4910.91s -> 4913.22s]  shuriken.
[4913.22s -> 4916.02s]  Polish
[4916.02s -> 4918.02s]  costs spirit embers.
[4918.02s -> 4921.60s]  Spirit embers?
[4921.60s -> 4924.74s]  Pull a shuriken loaded into the wheel
[4924.74s -> 4926.74s]  and launch at a target in a single flowing
[4926.74s -> 4928.74s]  motion. The swiftly thrown shuriken
[4928.74s -> 4930.74s]  damages enemy vitality and posture.
[4930.74s -> 4932.74s]  Particularly against those with a tendency
[4932.74s -> 4934.74s]  to take to the air.
[4934.74s -> 4943.50s]  Alright. Loaded shuriken.
[4943.50s -> 4949.71s]  Okay. So is
[4949.71s -> 4951.71s]  that on there?
[4961.71s -> 4964.08s]  Another fifty bucks.
[4964.08s -> 4966.51s]  Fifty dollars from
[4966.51s -> 4968.51s]  Koopa Troopa.
[4968.51s -> 4973.50s]  Hey Jerma, I thought this was the right time to donate
[4973.50s -> 4975.50s]  to. You have offered me and my brother so much
[4975.50s -> 4977.50s]  entertainment. I thought it was time to give back.
[4977.50s -> 4979.50s]  Thanks for everything and enjoy the game.
[4979.50s -> 4982.77s]  Thank you so much for the fifty
[4982.77s -> 4990.77s]  dollars. Happy you
[4990.77s -> 4992.77s]  and your brother can enjoy
[4992.77s -> 4994.77s]  the streams and videos and stuff. Thank you so much.
[4994.77s -> 4997.01s]  Seriously.
[4997.01s -> 5002.06s]  Big money today. I know. Apparently.
[5002.06s -> 5006.16s]  Prosthetic tool. Prosthetic tools
[5006.16s -> 5008.16s]  are shinobi tools adapted for use. There should be prosthetics.
[5008.16s -> 5010.40s]  I have a shuriken now.
[5010.40s -> 5012.40s]  So equipment menu and then using
[5012.40s -> 5014.40s]  them is spirit emblems.
[5014.40s -> 5018.88s]  So a prosthetic tool is right bumper.
[5018.88s -> 5024.94s]  Let's see here.
[5024.94s -> 5027.38s]  So I have prosthetic
[5027.38s -> 5029.38s]  tool slots. There are three slots available.
[5029.38s -> 5032.51s]  On the equipment selection
[5032.51s -> 5034.51s]  screen the controls can be viewed through Y.
[5034.51s -> 5038.53s]  Okay.
[5038.53s -> 5041.02s]  So I have the loaded shuriken
[5041.02s -> 5043.02s]  and that's all I can do now.
[5043.02s -> 5045.65s]  So that should be right bumper
[5045.65s -> 5047.65s]  is how to use this.
[5047.65s -> 5050.70s]  What is this?
[5050.70s -> 5052.70s]  You see the kind-faced Buddha there?
[5052.70s -> 5055.76s]  That isn't one of mine.
[5055.76s -> 5057.76s]  It was carved by the true
[5057.76s -> 5059.76s]  sculptor. The true sculptor.
[5059.76s -> 5061.76s]  A man must confront what is inside
[5061.76s -> 5063.76s]  of him. It can probably
[5063.76s -> 5065.76s]  be of help. Confront what
[5065.76s -> 5067.76s]  is inside him? Anger.
[5067.76s -> 5069.76s]  Sadness. Or perhaps
[5069.76s -> 5071.76s]  old memories of times
[5071.76s -> 5077.57s]  long gone.
[5077.57s -> 5080.90s]  I wonder if we can do something with this.
[5080.90s -> 5083.65s]  Spiral. So now
[5083.65s -> 5085.65s]  I guess it's time
[5085.65s -> 5089.23s]  spirit emblems
[5089.23s -> 5091.23s]  are required
[5091.23s -> 5093.23s]  to activate prosthetic tools and are consumed
[5093.23s -> 5095.23s]  each time these abilities are used.
[5095.23s -> 5097.47s]  They can be obtained from defeated
[5097.47s -> 5099.47s]  enemies in the world and purchased from
[5099.47s -> 5101.47s]  sculptor's idols.
[5101.47s -> 5103.47s]  If you pass near them they will find their way to you.
[5103.47s -> 5105.97s]  Interesting.
[5105.97s -> 5116.02s]  I wonder if this is
[5116.02s -> 5118.02s]  Derma's crying right now. What?
[5118.02s -> 5123.84s]  So you can only use this twice.
[5123.84s -> 5131.70s]  Before you have to redo it.
[5131.70s -> 5134.58s]  Interesting. Purchase spirit
[5134.58s -> 5136.94s]  emblems.
[5136.94s -> 5138.94s]  Two out of fifteen.
[5138.94s -> 5140.94s]  How much do they cost? Ten bucks?
[5140.94s -> 5146.62s]  What? Shit.
[5146.62s -> 5153.73s]  I don't even know how this works. I wonder if I should
[5153.73s -> 5158.72s]  buy a couple of these?
[5158.72s -> 5162.11s]  Not yet. Prayer bead.
[5162.11s -> 5164.11s]  What is the unseen aid?
[5164.11s -> 5166.11s]  Thirty percent. I have no idea
[5166.11s -> 5170.02s]  what it means. Let's just keep going. I've got no idea
[5170.02s -> 5175.52s]  what's going on. I just got
[5175.52s -> 5177.52s]  two thousand dollars. Don't be so stingy.
[5177.52s -> 5182.58s]  Oh yeah. That's just fucking
[5182.58s -> 5190.38s]  consumerism. Wait.
[5190.38s -> 5192.82s]  I can get up there. Oops. Oops.
[5192.82s -> 5194.82s]  Oops. Oops.
[5194.82s -> 5196.82s]  No. No. Can't stay
[5196.82s -> 5198.82s]  up there.
[5198.82s -> 5200.82s]  I just Mario jumped on his head.
[5200.82s -> 5202.82s]  No. Go up here.
[5202.82s -> 5208.11s]  Alright. We're fine.
[5208.11s -> 5210.11s]  Fucking consumerism.
[5210.11s -> 5221.04s]  They'll forget about me in a second.
[5221.04s -> 5224.24s]  Can I grab that?
[5224.24s -> 5226.24s]  They don't know I'm here, right?
[5226.24s -> 5231.55s]  Is there like an aggro range or something?
[5231.55s -> 5234.62s]  There's a giant
[5234.62s -> 5236.62s]  turkey. What? Why? Wait. Hold on a minute.
[5236.62s -> 5238.62s]  There's an enemy chickens?
[5238.62s -> 5240.62s]  Giant chickens?
[5240.62s -> 5245.36s]  No.
[5245.36s -> 5247.36s]  Why are there huge chickens?
[5247.36s -> 5249.36s]  And why did I
[5249.36s -> 5251.36s]  just murder it for no reason?
[5251.36s -> 5257.36s]  That's
[5257.36s -> 5259.36s]  so dumb. I love it.
[5259.36s -> 5262.18s]  Alright. We're just circling back around.
[5262.18s -> 5265.25s]  That's the best enemy
[5265.25s -> 5267.25s]  in any Souls game, I think.
[5267.25s -> 5269.25s]  Personally speaking here.
[5269.25s -> 5274.50s]  I'm so glad there are giant chickens.
[5274.50s -> 5283.82s]  Look at that. Let's go over there.
[5283.82s -> 5285.82s]  This isn't a Souls game. I know. I know. I know. I know.
[5285.82s -> 5288.45s]  Alright.
[5288.45s -> 5290.45s]  Guy right there. That is a
[5290.45s -> 5292.45s]  super bad guy. So I need to be
[5292.45s -> 5294.75s]  prepared. So let's go like
[5294.75s -> 5300.64s]  this. Let's wrap around.
[5300.64s -> 5303.20s]  Does he see me? Can he see
[5303.20s -> 5305.76s]  me? There's an item over here.
[5305.76s -> 5309.86s]  Watch out for that super bad guy.
[5309.86s -> 5312.03s]  Okay. Still hidden.
[5312.03s -> 5317.60s]  It's full of ash.
[5317.60s -> 5319.60s]  Oh. He sees me.
[5319.60s -> 5322.35s]  Alright. This is the first time we're going to get to see this.
[5322.35s -> 5324.35s]  Some enemies use unguardable
[5324.35s -> 5326.35s]  perilous attacks,
[5326.35s -> 5328.35s]  signified with a danger symbol.
[5328.35s -> 5331.94s]  When these occur, watch carefully
[5331.94s -> 5333.94s]  and try to respond properly as each
[5333.94s -> 5335.94s]  type requires a specific response.
[5335.94s -> 5343.62s]  As thrust
[5343.62s -> 5347.07s]  deflect,
[5347.07s -> 5349.07s]  jump, or
[5349.07s -> 5354.32s]  a grab.
[5354.32s -> 5356.32s]  What do they mean by sweep? So sweeping
[5356.32s -> 5358.32s]  attack. I'm assuming from left to right.
[5358.32s -> 5360.32s]  Thrust is straightforward.
[5360.32s -> 5362.32s]  Grab is a grab. Okay.
[5362.32s -> 5364.32s]  Let me just take him and figure this out.
[5364.32s -> 5366.32s]  Sweep is jump.
[5366.32s -> 5368.62s]  Like that?
[5368.62s -> 5370.62s]  That's what that means, right? Let me see.
[5370.62s -> 5374.72s]  Oops-a-daisy.
[5374.72s -> 5377.73s]  Alright. I get it.
[5377.73s -> 5383.04s]  That's sweep.
[5383.04s -> 5391.49s]  What the hell does
[5391.49s -> 5394.37s]  that mean though?
[5394.37s -> 5402.11s]  So you can interrupt it though too.
[5402.11s -> 5405.25s]  I think.
[5405.25s -> 5408.70s]  What about my... Should I use my
[5408.70s -> 5424.26s]  weapon thing?
[5424.26s -> 5431.36s]  Let's see. Don't even let him do it.
[5431.36s -> 5434.82s]  Don't even let him do it. Oh shit.
[5434.82s -> 5438.21s]  Oh fuck. No, no, no, no.
[5438.21s -> 5440.21s]  Okay. That symbol right there fucked me
[5440.21s -> 5451.01s]  up. Jesus.
[5451.01s -> 5453.01s]  Safety roll.
[5453.01s -> 5455.01s]  Alright. So I thought I had...
[5455.01s -> 5457.70s]  To stay down after being...
[5457.70s -> 5459.70s]  To stay down after being knocked to the ground
[5459.70s -> 5461.70s]  surely means death. Safety roll can be used to quickly
[5461.70s -> 5463.70s]  recover from being knocked down or posture
[5463.70s -> 5466.51s]  broken.
[5466.51s -> 5468.51s]  A will be a safety roll.
[5468.51s -> 5494.86s]  So what it was...
[5494.86s -> 5496.86s]  I'm trying to remember the controls for that.
[5496.86s -> 5500.58s]  Oh wow.
[5500.58s -> 5502.58s]  That was a fucking weird move.
[5502.58s -> 5506.03s]  Oh shit. I'm in trouble.
[5506.03s -> 5508.72s]  I'm dead. What the hell was that?
[5508.72s -> 5515.18s]  He did this little like...
[5515.18s -> 5517.18s]  He did a little tiny kick.
[5517.18s -> 5526.51s]  Wait.
[5526.51s -> 5528.51s]  Die or resurrect? Why do I have...
[5528.51s -> 5532.78s]  What?
[5532.78s -> 5534.78s]  Hold on. Why do I have a fucking arcade
[5534.78s -> 5536.78s]  continue screen? Should I come back?
[5536.78s -> 5541.50s]  Resurrect.
[5541.50s -> 5543.50s]  I get to die two times. That's the title of the game.
[5543.50s -> 5547.98s]  What?
[5547.98s -> 5549.98s]  The Divine Heir's Blood grants the ability to return
[5549.98s -> 5551.98s]  from the dead using Resurrective Power.
[5551.98s -> 5555.25s]  One charge is always
[5555.25s -> 5557.25s]  restored by resting at a Sculptor's
[5557.25s -> 5559.25s]  Idol, killing enemies restoring
[5559.25s -> 5561.42s]  additional charges.
[5561.42s -> 5563.42s]  Resurrection becomes unusable immediately
[5563.42s -> 5565.42s]  after using it for killing enemies will make it available
[5565.42s -> 5570.22s]  again. Alright.
[5570.22s -> 5572.66s]  So when you kill
[5572.66s -> 5574.66s]  people you get to charge your
[5574.66s -> 5576.66s]  comeback to life bar.
[5576.66s -> 5580.69s]  Shadows die twice.
[5580.69s -> 5582.69s]  If sometimes. If they've killed enough people.
[5582.69s -> 5585.06s]  Okay. Let's go.
[5585.06s -> 5587.62s]  That's a different move.
[5587.62s -> 5589.62s]  Oh my god. I'm gonna die again. Do I get...
[5589.62s -> 5591.62s]  Do shadows refill my health thing?
[5591.62s -> 5615.66s]  That's a grab.
[5615.66s -> 5617.66s]  Right. Okay. Grab is different.
[5617.66s -> 5623.49s]  Holy shit.
[5623.49s -> 5631.62s]  Back it up. Jesus Christ!
[5631.62s -> 5634.24s]  I'm almost out of posture.
[5634.24s -> 5644.34s]  I had it too.
[5644.34s -> 5646.34s]  I'm dead. I'm dead. Safety roll. Safety roll.
[5646.34s -> 5661.70s]  Oh fuck man!
[5661.70s -> 5663.70s]  When he swings that... You gotta...
[5663.70s -> 5667.84s]  Fuck!
[5667.84s -> 5669.84s]  So you don't want to take that many hits.
[5669.84s -> 5676.11s]  I gotta get back to my full posture
[5676.11s -> 5682.32s]  again.
[5682.32s -> 5684.32s]  Oh fuck. I'm dead.
[5684.32s -> 5692.83s]  Oh boy.
[5692.83s -> 5695.26s]  Shadows die
[5695.26s -> 5698.72s]  thrice. Alright.
[5698.72s -> 5704.74s]  Let's see what happens here. Experience
[5704.74s -> 5706.74s]  toward the next skill point
[5706.74s -> 5708.74s]  and current Sen in hand are
[5708.74s -> 5711.10s]  halved upon death.
[5711.10s -> 5714.50s]  Sends them money. Everything lost is
[5714.50s -> 5716.74s]  gone for good.
[5716.74s -> 5718.74s]  There are no known means to escape this
[5718.74s -> 5720.74s]  loss. However, through the grace of the gods
[5720.74s -> 5722.74s]  or Buddha it may not be impossible.
[5722.74s -> 5729.31s]  So wait a minute.
[5729.31s -> 5731.55s]  When you die
[5731.55s -> 5734.05s]  you lose half of everything.
[5734.05s -> 5736.05s]  And there is no go back and pick up
[5736.05s -> 5741.23s]  your money.
[5741.23s -> 5748.85s]  Oh shit. Really?
[5748.85s -> 5750.85s]  Wow. 44!
[5750.85s -> 5752.85s]  Oh!
[5752.85s -> 5754.85s]  No!
[5754.85s -> 5757.15s]  You lose forever!
[5757.15s -> 5762.96s]  Give me...
[5762.96s -> 5764.96s]  Just don't die. Apparently
[5764.96s -> 5766.96s]  I have no more pellets. Alright.
[5766.96s -> 5770.29s]  Let's get back over there.
[5770.29s -> 5772.98s]  Now that I've...
[5772.98s -> 5776.37s]  Scripted. Scripted death.
[5776.37s -> 5778.37s]  Is the chicken back? Just don't aggro the chicken.
[5778.37s -> 5781.18s]  Let's do this again.
[5781.18s -> 5783.18s]  Wait a second. Alright. Shadows only die
[5783.18s -> 5785.36s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Get up there.
[5785.36s -> 5787.36s]  No. Nevermind. Let's go. Let's go. Fuck it. I'm ready.
[5787.36s -> 5812.05s]  Watch that
[5812.05s -> 5814.05s]  fucking sword.
[5814.05s -> 5817.63s]  Who broke?
[5817.63s -> 5819.63s]  Me or him? Oh come on. What?
[5819.63s -> 5821.87s]  He's so close.
[5821.87s -> 5828.78s]  Let's go.
[5828.78s -> 5858.40s]  Ugh.
[5858.40s -> 5864.99s]  Fuck me. You're not doing that. Break him!
[5864.99s -> 5866.99s]  Break him! Alright. See you later.
[5866.99s -> 5874.74s]  A loose prayer bead. Offering
[5874.74s -> 5876.74s]  four of them in a sculptor's idol will increase
[5876.74s -> 5878.74s]  maximum vitality and posture.
[5878.74s -> 5881.42s]  Apparently the wolf has
[5881.42s -> 5883.42s]  one bead. Oh. That's leveling up.
[5883.42s -> 5887.39s]  Gotta see.
[5887.39s -> 5892.96s]  Do you reckon he practices these noises
[5892.96s -> 5894.96s]  in front of the bathroom mirror?
[5894.96s -> 5899.70s]  Like what?
[5899.70s -> 5902.51s]  So a seed from the healing waters
[5902.51s -> 5904.51s]  give to Emma to increase the maximum
[5904.51s -> 5906.51s]  uses of the healing board.
[5906.51s -> 5909.63s]  Right. There it is.
[5909.63s -> 5911.63s]  I hope you can't
[5911.63s -> 5914.77s]  lose these, right? I would
[5914.77s -> 5917.71s]  hope not. It would be pretty bad if you could.
[5917.71s -> 5922.26s]  But anyways, let's take a look
[5922.26s -> 5926.67s]  up here. Make sure I don't miss anything.
[5926.67s -> 5932.56s]  Doesn't look like I missed anything.
[5932.56s -> 5935.25s]  Yes I did. Shadows
[5935.25s -> 5937.25s]  check both ways.
[5937.25s -> 5939.25s]  AKA twice before crossing the street.
[5939.25s -> 5951.26s]  The pellet though. Alright.
[5951.26s -> 5954.26s]  Well, that guy's not gonna respawn.
[5954.26s -> 5956.26s]  He's like a super enemy. I'm gonna go back.
[5956.26s -> 5965.54s]  Good one, somebody said.
[5965.54s -> 5970.08s]  I actually left. See? Good.
[5970.08s -> 5972.58s]  The enhanced physical attributes option
[5972.58s -> 5974.58s]  has been unlocked in the sculptor's idol menu.
[5974.58s -> 5976.58s]  You can spend four prayer
[5976.58s -> 5978.58s]  beads to create a prayer necklace
[5978.58s -> 5980.58s]  which will permanently increase
[5980.58s -> 5982.58s]  your vitality and posture.
[5982.58s -> 5986.67s]  I need four.
[5986.67s -> 5989.30s]  Well, let's just go get
[5989.30s -> 5993.14s]  our gourd
[5993.14s -> 5999.60s]  upgraded.
[5999.60s -> 6004.27s]  So, what do those bar...
[6004.27s -> 6007.98s]  What does the thing in the lower left?
[6007.98s -> 6009.98s]  See that pizza pie with the hat
[6009.98s -> 6011.98s]  with the pizza slice taken out of it?
[6011.98s -> 6013.98s]  What is that timer?
[6023.36s -> 6025.36s]  It's your resurrection pizza, okay.
[6037.65s -> 6061.95s]  Of course.
[6061.95s -> 6063.95s]  It's a FromSoftware game, of course.
[6063.95s -> 6065.95s]  If they give you the option to just die,
[6065.95s -> 6067.95s]  there's some reason why you shouldn't resurrect.
[6067.95s -> 6076.13s]  Right? Okay, here.
[6082.03s -> 6084.03s]  If you could just resurrect,
[6084.03s -> 6086.03s]  there wouldn't be a
[6086.03s -> 6088.03s]  like, battlefield-style
[6088.03s -> 6091.81s]  just die button.
[6091.81s -> 6114.45s]  Okay, cool.
[6114.45s -> 6116.45s]  So, I have a question.
[6116.45s -> 6118.45s]  So, when you die,
[6118.45s -> 6120.45s]  right, does it matter
[6120.45s -> 6122.45s]  if you resurrect or not, do you still
[6122.45s -> 6124.45s]  lose half of all your shit no matter
[6124.45s -> 6126.45s]  what, or does the resurrection
[6126.45s -> 6128.45s]  stop the halving
[6128.45s -> 6131.14s]  of your stuff?
[6131.14s -> 6134.34s]  No. You don't lose shit
[6134.34s -> 6136.34s]  when you... Okay, so there's two sides
[6136.34s -> 6138.58s]  there. There's definitely gonna be
[6138.58s -> 6140.58s]  some kind of penalty for resurrecting.
[6140.58s -> 6142.58s]  But the penalty for not resurrecting is losing half
[6142.58s -> 6146.78s]  your shit. Okay.
[6146.78s -> 6149.47s]  I didn't... Hold on. I didn't
[6149.47s -> 6151.47s]  go this way at all. What is over here?
[6151.47s -> 6155.81s]  This is
[6155.81s -> 6157.81s]  an NPC that I haven't even talked to.
[6165.04s -> 6169.78s]  Your name? Won't tell me.
[6169.78s -> 6171.78s]  But you do have the look of a skilled
[6171.78s -> 6173.78s]  shinobi. A shinobi.
[6173.78s -> 6176.59s]  Or perhaps.
[6176.59s -> 6178.59s]  Sir, please heed
[6178.59s -> 6180.59s]  my humble request. Face me
[6180.59s -> 6183.15s]  in battle.
[6183.15s -> 6185.15s]  I wasn't
[6185.15s -> 6191.42s]  ready for that.
[6191.42s -> 6193.42s]  Wait a minute, this is like a from
[6193.42s -> 6195.42s]  software game. Should I let this guy kill me?
[6195.42s -> 6199.39s]  Should I not have done that to this guy?
[6199.39s -> 6206.29s]  Oh.
[6206.29s -> 6214.93s]  Is that it? Are we friends now?
[6214.93s -> 6219.79s]  Do I get to have your house?
[6250.85s -> 6252.85s]  He's... Not wrong.
[6255.66s -> 6257.66s]  He's kind of morbid, but okay.
[6257.66s -> 6259.66s]  Yeah.
[6259.66s -> 6264.46s]  I guess.
[6264.46s -> 6266.90s]  He's just bored.
[6269.26s -> 6271.26s]  Let's do it again.
[6273.26s -> 6281.50s]  Training.
[6281.50s -> 6283.50s]  Practice the basics of evasion.
[6283.50s -> 6285.50s]  Practice the basics of attacking.
[6285.50s -> 6289.09s]  What's the flex?
[6289.09s -> 6291.65s]  This is cool.
[6291.65s -> 6297.47s]  Sometimes relentless attack is not enough.
[6297.47s -> 6299.47s]  You have deflecting enemies' attacks, damages their posture.
[6299.47s -> 6303.06s]  Do three death blows.
[6315.97s -> 6317.97s]  I'm dead. I'm back.
[6328.27s -> 6330.27s]  I will.
[6335.76s -> 6338.96s]  I didn't even know you could do this.
[6338.96s -> 6340.96s]  Hold on. You can.
[6340.96s -> 6343.97s]  So there is a hold down
[6343.97s -> 6346.34s]  in charge. Alright.
[6346.34s -> 6348.34s]  Basics of attacking.
[6348.34s -> 6350.34s]  I stand as your opponent.
[6350.34s -> 6355.65s]  An enemy with broken
[6355.65s -> 6357.65s]  posture is vulnerable
[6357.65s -> 6359.65s]  to three death blows.
[6359.65s -> 6361.65s]  Yes, yes, yes.
[6361.65s -> 6374.37s]  Kid. Kid.
[6374.37s -> 6379.22s]  I wonder if eventually
[6379.22s -> 6381.22s]  I can get... I'm probably going to get some posture breaking
[6381.22s -> 6383.22s]  stuff.
[6383.22s -> 6385.22s]  Right. I'm going to get a
[6385.22s -> 6387.22s]  thing that costs 10
[6387.22s -> 6389.22s]  emblems to use and it's going to break like
[6389.22s -> 6391.22s]  50% posture or something. Alright. Step dodge.
[6391.22s -> 6393.22s]  We didn't really even learn this.
[6393.22s -> 6395.22s]  I stand as your opponent.
[6395.22s -> 6400.40s]  It allows you to avoid attacks. Dodging won't compromise
[6400.40s -> 6402.40s]  enemy posture but may help
[6402.40s -> 6404.40s]  avoid damage.
[6404.40s -> 6406.40s]  Evade enemy attacks and then attack and
[6406.40s -> 6408.40s]  perform three death blows.
[6408.40s -> 6417.23s]  Yes, I will.
[6417.23s -> 6419.23s]  I like how the animation of the death blow can happen
[6419.23s -> 6421.23s]  in front or behind. It's cool.
[6428.83s -> 6444.05s]  Kid. Kid.
[6444.05s -> 6448.08s]  Spend the whole stream killing this
[6448.08s -> 6450.08s]  one guy. So you can
[6450.08s -> 6452.51s]  feel good.
[6452.51s -> 6454.94s]  I think it's about time we tried
[6454.94s -> 6456.94s]  something closer to a real fight.
[6456.94s -> 6459.95s]  Come at me with the intent to kill.
[6459.95s -> 6461.95s]  No better way to prepare
[6461.95s -> 6465.02s]  for the real thing. What's wrong?
[6465.02s -> 6467.02s]  Why do you go to such lengths?
[6467.02s -> 6469.02s]  Half to pass the time.
[6469.02s -> 6471.02s]  And the other half... Expert training.
[6471.02s -> 6473.02s]  I want to loosen that
[6473.02s -> 6475.02s]  furrowed brow of yours.
[6475.02s -> 6477.71s]  Alright. Enough talk.
[6477.71s -> 6479.71s]  Sorry. Let's begin.
[6479.71s -> 6482.53s]  Free combat is now available.
[6482.53s -> 6485.28s]  Begin free combat. Fundamentals.
[6485.28s -> 6487.28s]  Now. Let's begin.
[6487.28s -> 6489.71s]  Yes.
[6489.71s -> 6491.71s]  You got more?
[6491.71s -> 6493.71s]  Practice what you've learned. Sure thing.
[6493.71s -> 6503.31s]  Fine. I'll just break you.
[6503.31s -> 6506.90s]  I'll break you.
[6506.90s -> 6515.65s]  Again.
[6515.65s -> 6517.65s]  So when they go for a grab
[6517.65s -> 6527.76s]  they don't get attacked. New training
[6527.76s -> 6532.61s]  is available. What?
[6532.61s -> 6536.19s]  Counter...
[6536.19s -> 6538.94s]  This is a...
[6538.94s -> 6541.12s]  This is going to be a
[6541.12s -> 6543.12s]  consecutive deflection.
[6543.12s -> 6547.73s]  I stand as your opponent.
[6547.73s -> 6550.03s]  Okay. Deflecting once
[6550.03s -> 6552.03s]  doesn't always mean an enemy will stop attacking.
[6552.03s -> 6554.03s]  Consecutive attacks can be countered with
[6554.03s -> 6556.03s]  consecutive deflections. Which can
[6556.03s -> 6558.03s]  greatly damage enemy posture.
[6558.03s -> 6560.03s]  Deflect all enemy attacks.
[6560.03s -> 6562.03s]  And before three death blows.
[6562.03s -> 6565.23s]  Let's see what happens here.
[6565.23s -> 6569.58s]  Three, four...
[6569.58s -> 6571.58s]  You gotta get it though. You gotta time it.
[6571.58s -> 6573.58s]  So it's...
[6573.58s -> 6579.66s]  That's going to be so hard
[6579.66s -> 6587.22s]  later on.
[6587.22s -> 6590.93s]  Imagine some of the bosses later on
[6590.93s -> 6592.93s]  that you're going to have to do that like ten times
[6592.93s -> 6596.13s]  in a row. Alright. Vitality
[6596.13s -> 6598.13s]  and posture.
[6598.13s -> 6600.13s]  You might as well just practice now.
[6600.13s -> 6605.06s]  The lower one's vitality the slower their posture
[6605.06s -> 6607.06s]  recovery is. This is good to know.
[6607.06s -> 6609.06s]  For enemies with seemingly unbreakable
[6609.06s -> 6611.06s]  posture use techniques such as
[6611.06s -> 6613.06s]  dodge.
[6613.06s -> 6615.06s]  Counterattack reduces their vitality.
[6615.06s -> 6617.06s]  Making their posture easier to break.
[6617.06s -> 6619.06s]  Ah.
[6619.06s -> 6621.55s]  Okay.
[6621.55s -> 6624.05s]  So...
[6624.05s -> 6626.05s]  Alright. This is very important
[6626.05s -> 6630.02s]  information. So
[6630.02s -> 6632.02s]  if somebody has high health
[6632.02s -> 6634.02s]  you're not going to ever be able to break
[6634.02s -> 6636.02s]  their posture if they're hard to break through.
[6636.02s -> 6638.02s]  So you have to get their health
[6638.02s -> 6640.45s]  down by dodging
[6640.45s -> 6642.45s]  or by hurting them. Not by
[6642.45s -> 6644.45s]  going blow to blow with the sword.
[6644.45s -> 6646.82s]  To a point where you can bring down
[6646.82s -> 6649.31s]  their posture. I would have
[6649.31s -> 6651.31s]  been raging at
[6651.31s -> 6653.31s]  this later on.
[6653.31s -> 6655.31s]  Why does this guy have such high posture?
[6655.31s -> 6657.31s]  Game's fucking broken.
[6657.31s -> 6670.75s]  So it's good that I did this.
[6670.75s -> 6674.14s]  So they recover posture slowly.
[6674.14s -> 6676.14s]  Oh that's so much better.
[6676.14s -> 6678.14s]  Yeah look at that.
[6678.14s -> 6682.69s]  You can just swing it on like once or twice.
[6682.69s -> 6686.34s]  Yeah.
[6686.34s -> 6688.34s]  That is a huge piece of information
[6688.34s -> 6697.81s]  that you need to know.
[6697.81s -> 6704.58s]  How bad it is. I'm glad I figured this out.
[6704.58s -> 6710.27s]  Alright let's come back to the
[6710.27s -> 6712.27s]  back out here please. I don't want to
[6712.27s -> 6719.57s]  phase out.
[6719.57s -> 6729.87s]  I did not see this tutorial.
[6729.87s -> 6732.69s]  This guy's actually fairly easy just to
[6732.69s -> 6735.89s]  walk by and never see.
[6735.89s -> 6737.89s]  It doesn't lower their posture, only their posture regeneration.
[6737.89s -> 6739.89s]  Yeah but that's still a big deal though.
[6739.89s -> 6742.96s]  I'm going to do it all. Countering
[6742.96s -> 6744.96s]  thrust attacks.
[6744.96s -> 6748.35s]  You can kill through vitality
[6748.35s -> 6750.35s]  as well as long as you can hit them
[6750.35s -> 6752.35s]  I guess somewhere in their back or a place where they can't
[6752.35s -> 6755.98s]  block.
[6755.98s -> 6757.98s]  Thrust attacks cannot be guarded
[6757.98s -> 6759.98s]  but they can be countered by deflecting
[6759.98s -> 6761.98s]  or step dodging to the side.
[6761.98s -> 6764.86s]  Okay I was kind of panicking when I saw this before.
[6764.86s -> 6767.17s]  So if you do a side
[6767.17s -> 6769.34s]  dodge you can counter.
[6769.34s -> 6773.12s]  Or if you deflect.
[6773.12s -> 6775.62s]  Or do a step dodge.
[6775.62s -> 6777.92s]  Alright so there you go. So before I thought you had to
[6777.92s -> 6779.92s]  Okay.
[6779.92s -> 6785.62s]  You can also block it too.
[6785.62s -> 6787.62s]  It's the right time that is.
[6787.62s -> 6794.72s]  You've got to be perfect. I'm not certain
[6794.72s -> 6796.72s]  I'm confident in being able to deflect
[6796.72s -> 6798.72s]  that especially if it goes right for you
[6798.72s -> 6800.72s]  and you can't block it.
[6800.72s -> 6805.82s]  Maybe.
[6805.82s -> 6807.82s]  What happens if this guy kills you?
[6807.82s -> 6810.26s]  You take his place.
[6810.26s -> 6814.22s]  This is important. Sweep attacks.
[6816.22s -> 6821.41s]  Sweep attacks cannot be guarded
[6821.41s -> 6823.41s]  or deflected. They must be jumped over
[6823.41s -> 6825.41s]  to be avoided.
[6825.41s -> 6827.41s]  Jump kicking an enemy during sweep attacks
[6827.41s -> 6829.41s]  deals heavy posture
[6829.41s -> 6831.41s]  damage. Perfect.
[6831.41s -> 6833.41s]  Often leading directly to a
[6833.41s -> 6836.67s]  death blow. Also great to know.
[6836.67s -> 6838.67s]  So jump in mid-air near the enemy
[6838.67s -> 6840.67s]  jump kick and it does a ton of posture damage.
[6840.67s -> 6843.94s]  Let's take a look.
[6843.94s -> 6848.10s]  Oh it's no. Alright
[6848.10s -> 6850.10s]  hold on a minute. It's just A twice.
[6850.10s -> 6854.24s]  Right.
[6854.24s -> 6857.12s]  Holy shit.
[6857.12s -> 6859.12s]  If I knew that before.
[6859.12s -> 6863.86s]  That last boss
[6863.86s -> 6865.86s]  that little mini boss that I fought.
[6865.86s -> 6867.86s]  That general. I would have killed him in probably
[6867.86s -> 6869.86s]  15 seconds.
[6869.86s -> 6884.43s]  Again.
[6884.43s -> 6886.43s]  How far? Okay you've got to be
[6886.43s -> 6888.43s]  close though. You can't do
[6888.43s -> 6892.91s]  it from that far away.
[6892.91s -> 6905.10s]  Again.
[6905.10s -> 6907.10s]  So the easiest way
[6907.10s -> 6909.10s]  to remember that is sweep is
[6909.10s -> 6912.11s]  AA. Thrust is
[6912.11s -> 6914.11s]  dodge or deflect.
[6914.11s -> 6916.48s]  And grab is dodge.
[6916.48s -> 6920.30s]  Let's do it again. Free combat.
[6924.06s -> 6935.63s]  What do you got? Back up this way.
[6935.63s -> 6938.90s]  Come on.
[6938.90s -> 6940.90s]  You're too far away. Oh
[6940.90s -> 6942.90s]  okay. I've got to get that right.
[6942.90s -> 6946.03s]  Ooh. It's hard to tell
[6946.03s -> 6948.03s]  sometimes. Ooh.
[6948.03s -> 6951.62s]  Thrust. Thrust is deflect
[6951.62s -> 6953.62s]  or dodge. You know what? I'm going to do dodge.
[6953.62s -> 6955.62s]  If I see that and I know it's a thrust
[6955.62s -> 6967.01s]  I'm going to dodge.
[6967.01s -> 6970.72s]  Yeah the sword comes up to the
[6970.72s -> 6972.72s]  head.
[6976.72s -> 6978.90s]  Oh easier on me.
[6980.90s -> 6982.90s]  Apologize.
[6982.90s -> 6984.90s]  I'm so sorry
[6984.90s -> 6986.90s]  sir. I don't mean to kill you.
[6986.90s -> 6989.52s]  I've killed him like 12 times.
[6989.52s -> 6991.52s]  Give thanks or apologize. I feel like this is important.
[6991.52s -> 6995.74s]  Maybe I'm going to say sorry.
[6995.74s -> 6999.84s]  Give thanks or apologize.
[6999.84s -> 7001.84s]  Give thanks or apologize. One false
[7001.84s -> 7005.49s]  move and this could go wrong.
[7011.01s -> 7013.95s]  Apologize. Bloodthirsty
[7013.95s -> 7015.95s]  streamer.
[7021.95s -> 7023.95s]  What?
[7027.95s -> 7031.73s]  Okay.
[7031.73s -> 7033.73s]  So
[7033.73s -> 7035.73s]  that's the training. What about talking?
[7039.73s -> 7041.73s]  What is that? From left?
[7041.73s -> 7043.73s]  A from laugh?
[7043.73s -> 7045.73s]  Yep.
[7050.10s -> 7053.68s]  It's in every game. Wait.
[7053.68s -> 7055.68s]  Something interesting in the box?
[7055.68s -> 7059.97s]  What's in the box? Items that become
[7059.97s -> 7061.97s]  unavailable elsewhere end up in the offering box.
[7061.97s -> 7065.10s]  When the box is
[7065.10s -> 7067.10s]  illuminated it means an item has found its way inside.
[7067.10s -> 7069.10s]  Items can be obtained by inspecting the box
[7069.10s -> 7072.43s]  and offering money.
[7072.43s -> 7076.51s]  The box is empty. Okay.
[7076.51s -> 7080.16s]  First P?
[7080.16s -> 7082.16s]  I think it's time for the first P
[7082.16s -> 7084.78s]  of the day.
[7084.78s -> 7086.78s]  Two hours. Two hours per P.
[7086.78s -> 7089.41s]  See you in like two minutes.
[7249.70s -> 7257.06s]  Who the fuck would sub to German?
[7257.06s -> 7260.77s]  You? You're subbed.
[7260.77s -> 7262.77s]  There's $50
[7262.77s -> 7264.77s]  from a minute, two minutes ago.
[7264.77s -> 7268.42s]  Toshiro.tv just gave $50.
[7268.42s -> 7271.42s]  You guys are showering me with fucking
[7271.42s -> 7274.05s]  money tonight. Holy shit.
[7274.05s -> 7276.74s]  Thank you. How do you feel knowing you
[7276.74s -> 7278.74s]  can hurricane Rana in From Software
[7278.74s -> 7281.81s]  games? Very satisfying
[7281.81s -> 7289.49s]  to do these moves.
[7289.49s -> 7291.73s]  A green shower.
[7291.73s -> 7293.73s]  Seriously, I don't even know
[7293.73s -> 7297.63s]  what to say. Thank you everybody.
[7297.63s -> 7300.19s]  This is an absolute shitload of money.
[7300.19s -> 7303.26s]  Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[7303.26s -> 7305.26s]  That's all I can say.
[7305.26s -> 7309.42s]  I can't believe it.
[7309.42s -> 7311.66s]  Let's hope you're enjoying the stream.
[7311.66s -> 7317.36s]  Speaking of the stream. Do you ever go to bed soaking
[7317.36s -> 7319.86s]  wet? Oh.
[7319.86s -> 7321.86s]  Do you ever go to bed soaking wet? I do not.
[7321.86s -> 7323.86s]  I do not go to bed soaking wet.
[7323.86s -> 7327.18s]  Cool. So we learned some tactics, some
[7327.18s -> 7329.18s]  techniques. Things that are good to know.
[7329.18s -> 7331.81s]  Let's continue the
[7331.81s -> 7336.10s]  journey. Didn't I get a better
[7336.10s -> 7338.59s]  healing gourd? Healing gourd.
[7338.59s -> 7343.71s]  There we go. Purchase
[7343.71s -> 7345.71s]  travel enhance. I don't have it.
[7345.71s -> 7347.71s]  Can I lose these prayer beads?
[7347.71s -> 7350.59s]  I'm scared I'm going to lose the prayer beads.
[7350.59s -> 7356.35s]  Turn on the Japanese
[7356.35s -> 7358.35s]  dialogue for a cutscene or two.
[7358.35s -> 7361.87s]  Alright. After
[7361.87s -> 7372.75s]  I beat
[7372.75s -> 7374.75s]  the first boss. I'll do it.
[7374.75s -> 7376.75s]  Which will be in like 15 minutes. I'm fucking being
[7376.75s -> 7381.04s]  the first try.
[7381.04s -> 7383.04s]  Back to it. This is where the
[7383.04s -> 7385.04s]  we just sit right here. This guy doesn't respawn.
[7385.04s -> 7387.54s]  I don't think.
[7387.54s -> 7392.02s]  Progress.
[7392.02s -> 7399.63s]  Why do you cough then mute the mic?
[7399.63s -> 7401.63s]  Well, because it's hard to
[7401.63s -> 7403.63s]  suppress a cough and I have to reach forward
[7403.63s -> 7406.19s]  and press button
[7406.19s -> 7408.19s]  here on my stream deck.
[7408.19s -> 7410.19s]  So what happens is I end up getting like
[7410.19s -> 7412.19s]  a quarter of it out before I have to press this button
[7412.19s -> 7414.19s]  here to mute. So it's hard to
[7414.19s -> 7416.19s]  sometimes predict it's
[7416.19s -> 7418.19s]  going to happen. Mute and then do it. I've done it
[7418.19s -> 7420.19s]  you probably heard a few
[7420.19s -> 7422.19s]  times it just go dead silent because I caught it early.
[7422.19s -> 7426.74s]  I am trying to
[7426.74s -> 7428.74s]  squelch that though.
[7428.74s -> 7430.74s]  I do apologize if it's annoying.
[7430.74s -> 7436.74s]  Okay.
[7436.74s -> 7438.74s]  Trees. Look at all these places to jump to.
[7438.74s -> 7440.74s]  All right. What we got? One guy.
[7440.74s -> 7443.17s]  Crows. We're going to go
[7443.17s -> 7445.66s]  crow route. Maybe.
[7445.66s -> 7448.67s]  I'm not quite close enough to that.
[7448.67s -> 7456.35s]  I can go this way.
[7456.35s -> 7460.64s]  I have to see what's going on with
[7460.64s -> 7467.92s]  these crows.
[7467.92s -> 7469.92s]  Light coin purse. Before it's filled with
[7469.92s -> 7471.92s]  a small amount of sen it can be used to acquire
[7471.92s -> 7473.92s]  the sen inside. Has a somewhat
[7473.92s -> 7475.92s]  satisfying weight to it.
[7475.92s -> 7486.08s]  I'm not opening that.
[7486.08s -> 7488.08s]  Oh my god.
[7488.08s -> 7490.08s]  Oh.
[7490.08s -> 7492.08s]  I was trying to jump.
[7492.08s -> 7496.43s]  Somebody has a gun.
[7496.43s -> 7498.93s]  Who has the gun? That's
[7498.93s -> 7508.59s]  guy. Boy there's a lot of people here.
[7508.59s -> 7510.59s]  Which one has the gun?
[7519.02s -> 7521.33s]  I'm not even locked onto him.
[7521.33s -> 7523.33s]  That guy. No. I think he doesn't
[7523.33s -> 7530.62s]  have a gun. Shit.
[7530.62s -> 7534.34s]  Oh my
[7534.34s -> 7538.30s]  god. There's too many people.
[7538.30s -> 7544.13s]  Actually too many people.
[7544.13s -> 7546.37s]  Aggro the whole entire
[7546.37s -> 7548.37s]  fucking city.
[7548.37s -> 7556.82s]  So unlike other
[7556.82s -> 7558.82s]  From Software games. No I was just
[7558.82s -> 7560.82s]  locked onto that guy.
[7560.82s -> 7563.25s]  It's actually really hard to fight more than one
[7563.25s -> 7567.79s]  person at a time. Before you could kind of
[7567.79s -> 7569.79s]  just get like a big weapon and just swing it in a circle
[7569.79s -> 7571.79s]  and kill five people. Oh my god.
[7571.79s -> 7573.79s]  Somebody just gave 20 community subs.
[7573.79s -> 7594.51s]  Come here. No wrong guy.
[7594.51s -> 7596.51s]  I wanted to lock onto the guy in front of me.
[7596.51s -> 7599.20s]  Why the hell would I want to lock onto the guy
[7599.20s -> 7605.79s]  behind him? I can't see
[7605.79s -> 7611.87s]  shit. Oh fuck I'm dead.
[7615.07s -> 7623.33s]  Come on. Swing. Come on.
[7623.33s -> 7625.70s]  Swing.
[7625.70s -> 7639.97s]  There's still somebody with a gun.
[7639.97s -> 7641.97s]  Alright. Who gave the 20 community subs?
[7641.97s -> 7646.83s]  Seriously. I
[7646.83s -> 7650.67s]  missed it. Those gift subs
[7650.67s -> 7652.67s]  just crashed the app on my
[7652.67s -> 7654.67s]  phone. It's Bob.
[7654.67s -> 7656.67s]  It's Bob time.
[7656.67s -> 7662.29s]  Thank you Bob. And thank
[7662.29s -> 7665.74s]  you for your time. Alright.
[7665.74s -> 7668.80s]  I gotta get up. I'm killing this
[7668.80s -> 7673.28s]  guy. Can I like stealth
[7673.28s -> 7678.46s]  grab him or something?
[7678.46s -> 7680.46s]  I guess. I guess so.
[7680.46s -> 7683.02s]  That whizzed right by my head.
[7683.02s -> 7685.02s]  I'm just gonna take it.
[7685.02s -> 7691.22s]  Cause it...
[7691.22s -> 7693.22s]  Oh what?
[7693.22s -> 7695.22s]  I didn't. No.
[7695.22s -> 7697.22s]  I was trying to. I was gonna
[7697.22s -> 7699.22s]  block it. I couldn't even see him.
[7699.22s -> 7706.94s]  Should I resurrect?
[7706.94s -> 7708.94s]  Oh I don't know what this means. I don't know
[7708.94s -> 7710.94s]  how bad this is. No I'm just dying.
[7710.94s -> 7715.23s]  This is gonna be bad for me to resurrect this
[7715.23s -> 7717.23s]  many times in the beginning of the game.
[7717.23s -> 7724.98s]  I'm so scared to resurrect.
[7724.98s -> 7734.13s]  Alright. Well this time I don't want
[7734.13s -> 7736.43s]  to aggro the entire
[7736.43s -> 7741.55s]  camp. Death is worse.
[7741.55s -> 7743.98s]  I don't know
[7743.98s -> 7750.06s]  that yet. I still have the coin
[7750.06s -> 7752.06s]  purse. So I'm good. Alright.
[7752.06s -> 7754.06s]  Let's jump down here in stealth.
[7754.06s -> 7765.58s]  I don't think it's a penalty for resurrecting.
[7765.58s -> 7771.28s]  Where's the
[7771.28s -> 7773.28s]  guy with the shoot you in the head
[7773.28s -> 7777.44s]  sniper rifle?
[7777.44s -> 7779.44s]  There's an item over there. He's right there.
[7779.44s -> 7781.44s]  Alright. I'm gonna wrap around. This is what I'm gonna do.
[7781.44s -> 7784.38s]  Go on over there. I'm gonna jump on the
[7784.38s -> 7787.01s]  tree. Can they see me
[7787.01s -> 7789.70s]  on top of them? Do they have the ability
[7789.70s -> 7793.60s]  to look up in the air?
[7793.60s -> 7796.29s]  Let's eavesdrop.
[7802.10s -> 7812.45s]  I want that item down here.
[7816.75s -> 7825.78s]  What? Where was my
[7825.78s -> 7827.78s]  Well can't you do a stealth takedown?
[7827.78s -> 7829.78s]  I thought it was a stealth
[7829.78s -> 7831.78s]  takedown. Huh?
[7848.08s -> 7851.92s]  Alright. It's just a fucking vase.
[7851.92s -> 7855.63s]  I thought if you jumped off of the
[7855.63s -> 7857.63s]  of a perch you could
[7857.63s -> 7862.50s]  do a apparently
[7862.50s -> 7864.50s]  not. Alright. Well that's good to know.
[7864.50s -> 7868.40s]  So I'm gonna go. Let's just keep
[7868.40s -> 7870.40s]  wait there's a guy right there. Three
[7870.40s -> 7874.56s]  people there. There's the whole
[7874.56s -> 7876.93s]  camp. I can take that guy out.
[7876.93s -> 7879.42s]  And nobody over here right?
[7879.42s -> 7887.74s]  Holy shit this guy's
[7887.74s -> 7892.03s]  huge. Alright.
[7892.03s -> 7904.77s]  No don't do that. I had to get
[7904.77s -> 7909.63s]  the big dude with the mallard. Only one
[7909.63s -> 7912.06s]  guy saw that. This guy.
[7912.06s -> 7920.43s]  Okay.
[7920.43s -> 7924.00s]  There's an item in here too. I'm being
[7924.00s -> 7926.00s]  followed.
[7948.08s -> 7952.88s]  I don't got time to fucking care about this right now
[7952.88s -> 7954.88s]  but you can get more
[7954.88s -> 7956.88s]  items. Ooh. What's this?
[7956.88s -> 7959.12s]  Ooh. Ooh.
[7959.12s -> 7961.12s]  I don't know. Who saw me?
[7961.12s -> 7963.12s]  Who has a gun shooting at me? It's that person.
[7963.12s -> 7972.51s]  Reloading. That was a really
[7972.51s -> 7974.51s]  quick reload by the way.
[7974.51s -> 7990.05s]  Just take them all out.
[7990.05s -> 8004.94s]  I got too greedy there.
[8004.94s -> 8006.94s]  Just drink. I don't want to do that again.
[8006.94s -> 8014.30s]  What? How did I not deflect that?
[8014.30s -> 8016.30s]  You're making me look bad.
[8016.30s -> 8020.08s]  I almost cleared the whole
[8020.08s -> 8025.07s]  area. I feel like I should use some of this shit.
[8025.07s -> 8032.30s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[8032.30s -> 8034.30s]  There's a lot to look at here.
[8034.30s -> 8040.00s]  Don't fall off that.
[8040.00s -> 8043.01s]  Why would you let me go over there?
[8043.01s -> 8049.79s]  Don't want to miss anything
[8049.79s -> 8051.79s]  like something over here. Right?
[8051.79s -> 8057.47s]  No. Why are you
[8057.47s -> 8060.16s]  here? Why are you making me
[8060.16s -> 8062.16s]  think there's something over there?
[8062.16s -> 8065.62s]  Typical from. See what I mean?
[8065.62s -> 8071.36s]  Is that an enemy?
[8071.36s -> 8076.54s]  I think it's an NPC.
[8076.54s -> 8080.06s]  It is an NPC but who is this?
[8080.06s -> 8092.74s]  It's just a chicken.
[8092.74s -> 8094.74s]  Chicken.
[8096.74s -> 8107.41s]  Alright, we're fine.
[8107.41s -> 8109.41s]  I am going to sneak in here though.
[8109.41s -> 8113.57s]  Look at this free shit.
[8113.57s -> 8115.94s]  Coin purse.
[8115.94s -> 8119.52s]  Coin purse.
[8119.52s -> 8121.52s]  Coin purse.
[8121.52s -> 8126.32s]  Nice. Now the question is
[8126.32s -> 8128.32s]  is the person up top an NPC?
[8128.32s -> 8135.68s]  And are they going to get startled if I jump up here?
[8135.68s -> 8137.68s]  Let's just see what happens.
[8137.68s -> 8139.68s]  They have a marker over them so
[8139.68s -> 8143.33s]  I'm going to assume you're friendly.
[8143.33s -> 8147.17s]  For now.
[8154.34s -> 8158.50s]  Have you seen...
[8158.50s -> 8160.50s]  I'm not your son.
[8160.50s -> 8164.19s]  Sorry.
[8164.19s -> 8166.19s]  She reminds me of one of those bloodborne enemies that has the lanterns.
[8166.19s -> 8169.90s]  Or what if I just pretend I'm
[8169.90s -> 8176.24s]  the son?
[8176.24s -> 8178.24s]  If I don't say anything to her.
[8178.24s -> 8180.24s]  She thinks I'm her kid.
[8180.24s -> 8182.24s]  If I talk it
[8182.24s -> 8184.24s]  takes it all down away.
[8184.24s -> 8186.24s]  Oh.
[8188.24s -> 8190.24s]  Got it.
[8224.58s -> 8226.58s]  Okay.
[8226.58s -> 8228.58s]  Anything else?
[8228.58s -> 8230.75s]  Huh.
[8230.75s -> 8232.75s]  Alright.
[8232.75s -> 8240.10s]  Sprint push off cliff.
[8240.10s -> 8242.10s]  I can talk to that person too.
[8242.10s -> 8247.41s]  What do you have to say?
[8247.41s -> 8255.54s]  Uh...
[8255.54s -> 8265.76s]  I can...
[8265.76s -> 8268.26s]  What if I say nothing?
[8268.26s -> 8271.07s]  Am I just going to be silent
[8271.07s -> 8273.07s]  protagonist in this stream?
[8273.07s -> 8275.07s]  I feel like I should say something.
[8275.07s -> 8278.08s]  Yes.
[8278.08s -> 8282.67s]  Do you have any prayer beads?
[8282.67s -> 8286.51s]  Oh.
[8286.51s -> 8288.51s]  This is the son.
[8318.39s -> 8323.18s]  Okay.
[8333.86s -> 8335.86s]  So should I offer it?
[8335.86s -> 8338.74s]  Probably should go back.
[8338.74s -> 8340.74s]  Offer it to Buddha, come back, and then...
[8340.74s -> 8342.74s]  Yeah, but I need another checkpoint though.
[8342.74s -> 8344.74s]  That was hell getting through that.
[8344.74s -> 8346.74s]  That was such a pain in the ass.
[8346.74s -> 8350.07s]  There's so many enemies here.
[8350.07s -> 8352.07s]  Where's the illusory wall to give me
[8352.07s -> 8357.00s]  a new bonfire?
[8357.00s -> 8366.98s]  There might be one right here.
[8366.98s -> 8373.00s]  Of course, right when I walk down here.
[8373.00s -> 8375.00s]  I can go up, but...
[8375.00s -> 8379.35s]  Is there like a...
[8379.35s -> 8381.91s]  Can I do that?
[8381.91s -> 8391.77s]  How do you do that?
[8391.77s -> 8394.52s]  Oh, the ceramics. Right, right, right.
[8394.52s -> 8402.84s]  That's how you do...
[8402.84s -> 8405.14s]  That's a big guy.
[8405.14s -> 8409.11s]  That guy has a bed post.
[8409.11s -> 8411.93s]  Watch out for the giant guy with the bed post.
[8411.93s -> 8414.42s]  No, I cannot whistle. I don't know how.
[8414.42s -> 8416.42s]  I'm going to throw a ceramic over here.
[8416.42s -> 8418.42s]  I might as well use them.
[8418.42s -> 8420.42s]  You don't see the other zeros.
[8420.42s -> 8429.77s]  Alright, so...
[8429.77s -> 8440.95s]  What's the range on that?
[8440.95s -> 8450.49s]  What's the range on that?
[8450.49s -> 8453.30s]  I'm just going to pull him. Fuck it.
[8453.30s -> 8455.30s]  The guy with the bed post. That's a cannon.
[8455.30s -> 8457.30s]  That's a mortar.
[8457.30s -> 8461.27s]  Now the guy with the mortar knows I exist.
[8461.27s -> 8463.27s]  Wonderful.
[8463.27s -> 8471.91s]  That's just fantastic.
[8471.91s -> 8474.28s]  That's fantastic.
[8474.28s -> 8479.21s]  He doesn't see me over here, right?
[8479.21s -> 8481.38s]  Yes, he doesn't.
[8481.38s -> 8484.78s]  He doesn't.
[8484.78s -> 8486.78s]  Alright, we've got to move.
[8486.78s -> 8493.24s]  I've got to plan.
[8493.24s -> 8498.81s]  Maybe he'll stop. I'll take this.
[8498.81s -> 8504.12s]  Sugar, more sugar.
[8504.12s -> 8506.12s]  The high Senpu priest
[8506.12s -> 8508.12s]  gave this candy to a band of short
[8508.12s -> 8510.12s]  but adept assassins.
[8510.12s -> 8512.12s]  Suppresses sound and presence for a time
[8512.12s -> 8515.19s]  making the user harder to detect.
[8515.19s -> 8517.19s]  So it's a stealth candy.
[8517.19s -> 8519.19s]  Bite the candy and take the
[8519.19s -> 8521.19s]  gachin stance to impart
[8521.19s -> 8523.19s]  its inhuman benediction.
[8523.19s -> 8525.19s]  Once hired guards, now extensions of the monks
[8525.19s -> 8527.19s]  will in their quest for undeath. So it's a stealth candy.
[8530.33s -> 8534.42s]  Apparently somebody can see me over here.
[8534.42s -> 8539.54s]  I don't know who. Who can see me?
[8539.54s -> 8543.18s]  I don't know.
[8543.18s -> 8550.14s]  Let's go.
[8550.14s -> 8552.31s]  I almost just fell off.
[8552.31s -> 8554.49s]  I'm going to grab that tree.
[8554.49s -> 8556.49s]  It's not safe. Please.
[8556.49s -> 8561.16s]  Okay, we're fine. I wonder if he gave up
[8561.16s -> 8576.46s]  shooting. I can sneak behind
[8576.46s -> 8581.13s]  him. Nobody else over here, right?
[8581.13s -> 8583.13s]  I'm going for it. He's not stupid
[8583.13s -> 8585.13s]  enough to turn around and just fire the cannon at my face, right?
[8585.13s -> 8594.98s]  Black gunpowder.
[8594.98s -> 8597.35s]  Material used in alchemical
[8597.35s -> 8599.35s]  prosthetic tool upgrades, including those
[8599.35s -> 8601.35s]  of an explosive and occultic nature.
[8601.35s -> 8603.35s]  Even the most mundane form
[8603.35s -> 8605.35s]  of gunpowder has a wide variety of applications.
[8605.35s -> 8611.75s]  So
[8611.75s -> 8614.18s]  gunpowder. Let's go ahead and take
[8614.18s -> 8616.18s]  out the two people in the front door.
[8616.18s -> 8618.18s]  You know, like LOL.
[8621.37s -> 8623.37s]  What you meant to say is just
[8623.37s -> 8625.93s]  fucking do that and do it again.
[8625.93s -> 8640.63s]  Nice.
[8640.63s -> 8642.63s]  How many healing? I don't have any healing left.
[8642.63s -> 8644.81s]  I just have pellets, which is
[8644.81s -> 8648.84s]  bad. Oh, whoa.
[8648.84s -> 8650.84s]  Wait a minute. What's that? Look at all that.
[8650.84s -> 8652.84s]  Look at all that shit.
[8652.84s -> 8655.98s]  I got to get over there.
[8655.98s -> 8660.82s]  How do I get there? Can I? Come on.
[8660.82s -> 8666.58s]  Is it the first cookie bug in the game?
[8666.58s -> 8668.82s]  No. A cookie bug's even
[8668.82s -> 8675.80s]  in this game. I don't think there are
[8675.80s -> 8677.80s]  those bugs are even in this game.
[8677.80s -> 8684.20s]  Possession balloon.
[8684.20s -> 8686.20s]  A people balloon filled with fountainhead water
[8686.20s -> 8688.20s]  with the blessing of fortune.
[8688.20s -> 8690.20s]  If one pops this vibrant green balloon,
[8690.20s -> 8692.20s]  those as water flashes
[8692.20s -> 8694.20s]  will have a higher chance of obtaining items.
[8694.20s -> 8696.20s]  So it's like magic find.
[8696.20s -> 8701.06s]  Magic find.
[8701.06s -> 8703.24s]  Two magic find balloons.
[8703.24s -> 8711.18s]  Another item over here.
[8711.18s -> 8725.05s]  Any more? Iron.
[8725.05s -> 8727.48s]  Basic reinforcement.
[8727.48s -> 8729.91s]  Maybe this is
[8729.91s -> 8731.91s]  like the shards, possibly.
[8731.91s -> 8734.09s]  I don't even know
[8734.09s -> 8736.09s]  what the hell I'm going right now.
[8736.09s -> 8739.86s]  What did I do?
[8739.86s -> 8741.86s]  Where did I end up? I'm going all
[8741.86s -> 8744.55s]  the way around the mountain.
[8744.55s -> 8747.24s]  I guess we're going to
[8747.24s -> 8763.18s]  keep going this way. Whoa.
[8763.18s -> 8765.18s]  Can those rocks fall? Is there a
[8765.18s -> 8769.46s]  better place for me to go from here?
[8769.46s -> 8784.31s]  Can I hug this wall? Please.
[8784.31s -> 8801.83s]  I hate when it does
[8801.83s -> 8803.83s]  that. I keep thinking I'm going to fall off.
[8803.83s -> 8808.63s]  Absolutely gorgeous.
[8808.63s -> 8810.63s]  It's a gorgeous game. Gorgeous.
[8810.63s -> 8816.63s]  Uh...
[8819.19s -> 8821.88s]  Spider-Man? Maybe a
[8821.88s -> 8824.25s]  Spider-Man scenario? I'm going to try!
[8824.25s -> 8826.49s]  Oh!
[8826.49s -> 8829.11s]  That could have been bad.
[8829.11s -> 8831.99s]  I would have lost half my HP.
[8831.99s -> 8842.87s]  It seems
[8842.87s -> 8844.87s]  so much bigger
[8844.87s -> 8847.50s]  than any of their previous games.
[8847.50s -> 8851.21s]  It's open. It's huge.
[8851.21s -> 8853.21s]  There's a lot to explore. It's almost overwhelming.
[8853.21s -> 8855.21s]  Because of how big this is.
[8855.21s -> 8857.83s]  And how much you can see.
[8857.83s -> 8859.83s]  There's a lot of people over here, so hold on.
[8859.83s -> 8861.83s]  Oh! Give me, give me, give me!
[8861.83s -> 8866.89s]  Thank God.
[8866.89s -> 8875.40s]  It's all the vertical movement. Yeah.
[8875.40s -> 8878.28s]  There's a lot of it. Alright, let me go back
[8878.28s -> 8881.48s]  to the town and
[8881.48s -> 8883.48s]  see what he has to say about this bell
[8883.48s -> 8890.20s]  thing. Great Canadian
[8890.20s -> 8892.20s]  Fuck Club. Ten community subs.
[8892.20s -> 8894.63s]  Back at it again. With the
[8894.63s -> 8896.63s]  major community subs.
[8896.63s -> 8898.63s]  Thank you so much, Great Canadian.
[8898.63s -> 8904.65s]  Let's find out what we can do with this.
[8904.65s -> 8908.49s]  What is it? Seems to be
[8908.49s -> 8910.49s]  your battle sense has returned.
[8910.49s -> 8912.49s]  You're more like a shinobi
[8912.49s -> 8914.49s]  than before. If
[8914.49s -> 8916.92s]  only a little. Take this.
[8916.92s -> 8919.86s]  A book of secrets
[8919.86s -> 8921.86s]  that details a variety of techniques
[8921.86s -> 8923.86s]  grants the ability to learn
[8923.86s -> 8925.86s]  shinobi style skills.
[8925.86s -> 8928.42s]  Within this text are the
[8928.42s -> 8930.42s]  innermost secrets of the shinobi arts.
[8930.42s -> 8932.42s]  Such as attacks performed in the air
[8932.42s -> 8934.42s]  and hiding one's body to avoid
[8934.42s -> 8936.42s]  detection.
[8936.42s -> 8938.42s]  What is it? What?
[8938.42s -> 8940.42s]  Shinobi techniques
[8940.42s -> 8942.42s]  recorded within are fighting techniques
[8942.42s -> 8944.42s]  that cannot be performed
[8944.42s -> 8948.07s]  by samurai.
[8948.07s -> 8950.07s]  Whether you make use of them or not
[8950.07s -> 8952.07s]  is up to you. Shinobi
[8952.07s -> 8954.07s]  aren't the only ones with their
[8954.07s -> 8956.07s]  own fighting techniques.
[8956.07s -> 8958.89s]  So now
[8958.89s -> 8961.58s]  skills. Owning
[8961.58s -> 8963.58s]  an esoteric text of a combat style
[8963.58s -> 8965.58s]  will allow its skills to be acquired in the
[8965.58s -> 8967.58s]  sculptor's idle skill menu.
[8967.58s -> 8969.88s]  Each enemy defeated provides skill
[8969.88s -> 8971.88s]  experience. Skill points are acquired
[8971.88s -> 8973.88s]  once enough
[8973.88s -> 8975.88s]  experience is gained which can be spent
[8975.88s -> 8977.88s]  to unlock skills. Some skills can
[8977.88s -> 8979.88s]  also be learned by obtaining items or defeating
[8979.88s -> 8982.44s]  enemies.
[8982.44s -> 8984.44s]  So there actually is just a level up bar in the game.
[8984.44s -> 8986.44s]  Harmony Accord thanks to the five community
[8986.44s -> 8991.03s]  subs. Thank you.
[8991.03s -> 8993.46s]  Subs rolling in.
[8993.46s -> 8995.46s]  This is the...
[8995.46s -> 8999.05s]  Is this the...
[8999.05s -> 9001.05s]  What the hell is he telling me?
[9005.05s -> 9007.42s]  I've seen you.
[9033.53s -> 9035.53s]  Do I have any new tools? I have gunpowder? No.
[9035.53s -> 9044.34s]  All right.
[9044.34s -> 9046.34s]  So this is Prey.
[9046.34s -> 9056.89s]  What does this do?
[9056.89s -> 9058.89s]  Close your eyes.
[9058.89s -> 9060.89s]  Hear the bell speak to you.
[9060.89s -> 9063.51s]  DLC area?
[9063.51s -> 9077.40s]  Someone just said sorta.
[9077.40s -> 9079.40s]  The bell's chime
[9079.40s -> 9081.40s]  will stir your
[9081.40s -> 9087.34s]  thoughts. Waken
[9087.34s -> 9089.34s]  from their slumber.
[9089.34s -> 9095.29s]  Day one
[9095.29s -> 9098.87s]  DLC. Three years
[9098.87s -> 9104.95s]  ago.
[9104.95s -> 9111.03s]  So wait am I...
[9111.03s -> 9113.03s]  I'm in like a dream world? Dream
[9113.03s -> 9115.03s]  world.
[9115.03s -> 9121.88s]  Yeah. New
[9121.88s -> 9125.34s]  skills.
[9125.34s -> 9127.34s]  Oh boy there's a skill tree.
[9127.34s -> 9129.83s]  Spend skill points
[9129.83s -> 9131.83s]  in the skill menu. New combat styles can be
[9131.83s -> 9133.83s]  learned through obtaining texts for each
[9133.83s -> 9136.39s]  style.
[9136.39s -> 9138.39s]  There are three types. Combat
[9138.39s -> 9140.39s]  arts, shinobi martial arts,
[9140.39s -> 9142.95s]  and latent skills.
[9142.95s -> 9144.95s]  Combat arts must be equipped to be used
[9144.95s -> 9146.95s]  in combat. Shinobi martial arts and latent skills are always
[9146.95s -> 9148.95s]  in effect upon being acquired.
[9148.95s -> 9153.50s]  So this is a
[9153.50s -> 9155.50s]  combat art. Whirlwind slash.
[9155.50s -> 9164.39s]  So this is available. This is not
[9164.39s -> 9168.42s]  available. Counter thrust
[9168.42s -> 9170.79s]  attacks. This is all. I guess
[9170.79s -> 9175.14s]  I'm just gonna do this.
[9175.14s -> 9179.69s]  Why wouldn't I just get this right now?
[9179.69s -> 9184.17s]  Whirlwind slash. But do I only get
[9184.17s -> 9186.17s]  a certain amount of these books?
[9186.17s -> 9192.31s]  Or points or something.
[9192.31s -> 9194.31s]  Enables one to counter enemy thrust attacks by
[9194.31s -> 9196.31s]  stomping down on an enemy's weapon.
[9196.31s -> 9198.68s]  Nearly impossible to perceive the speed
[9198.68s -> 9200.68s]  of a thrust, but not for the sharp eyes of
[9200.68s -> 9204.20s]  a shinobi.
[9204.20s -> 9208.74s]  Okay. I'm just gonna
[9208.74s -> 9212.65s]  get the first one. So how do I do
[9212.65s -> 9214.65s]  that? Maybe I can go back to the training guy?
[9214.65s -> 9222.20s]  I like the idea of hitting multiple
[9222.20s -> 9229.69s]  people. Okay combat arts are special
[9229.69s -> 9231.69s]  attack skills based on the strengths of the fighting
[9231.69s -> 9233.69s]  style they belong to. They
[9233.69s -> 9235.69s]  must be equipped in the equipment menu.
[9235.69s -> 9238.76s]  And can be learned
[9238.76s -> 9240.76s]  through the skill menu or found in special texts.
[9240.76s -> 9243.13s]  So left trigger
[9243.13s -> 9245.13s]  while holding. Right trigger while holding
[9245.13s -> 9247.13s]  left trigger is the
[9247.13s -> 9251.54s]  combat art. Let's go put it on.
[9251.54s -> 9255.00s]  You can only have one on at a time.
[9255.00s -> 9257.94s]  Oh there it is. Okay.
[9257.94s -> 9262.36s]  So it's
[9262.36s -> 9265.56s]  just both at the same time.
[9265.56s -> 9269.85s]  Alright so you can hold it. Just
[9269.85s -> 9271.85s]  hold it and bang. It doesn't
[9271.85s -> 9273.85s]  cost anything.
[9273.85s -> 9275.85s]  That's a pretty cool move though. That's actually
[9275.85s -> 9277.85s]  fantastic. I'm gonna love that. I'm gonna
[9277.85s -> 9281.50s]  love it. Somebody said play conquer
[9281.50s -> 9284.44s]  is bad for a day.
[9284.44s -> 9289.24s]  No.
[9289.24s -> 9291.24s]  Like right now?
[9291.24s -> 9293.24s]  I don't think that's gonna happen.
[9293.24s -> 9300.65s]  Hirata Estate.
[9300.65s -> 9302.65s]  I feel like I probably shouldn't be
[9302.65s -> 9304.65s]  here right now. But for the sake
[9304.65s -> 9306.65s]  of just seeing what's here I'm gonna go over here.
[9306.65s -> 9324.23s]  Can I go up? No. Guy
[9324.23s -> 9326.23s]  right there. I gotta try my
[9326.23s -> 9333.85s]  new move on somebody.
[9333.85s -> 9335.85s]  Oh this is somebody. I don't even know how it works.
[9335.85s -> 9338.66s]  I'm just starting to barely
[9338.66s -> 9340.66s]  understand the mechanics of the game.
[9340.66s -> 9351.03s]  Sorry. Alright. Anybody
[9351.03s -> 9353.03s]  over there? I could probably sneak up on
[9353.03s -> 9357.38s]  this dude. Well I'm not gonna sneak up
[9357.38s -> 9359.38s]  on that guy.
[9359.38s -> 9363.91s]  Should have paid more attention.
[9363.91s -> 9365.91s]  Dowsing Powder. Treating burns.
[9365.91s -> 9370.07s]  Reduces burn damage
[9370.07s -> 9372.07s]  and
[9372.07s -> 9374.07s]  you put it all over here and it makes you not
[9374.07s -> 9376.95s]  be burned. Let's go.
[9376.95s -> 9384.57s]  What a dude. Alright.
[9384.57s -> 9390.58s]  Nice job.
[9390.58s -> 9394.49s]  I'll give you credit. You did try to burn it.
[9394.49s -> 9398.26s]  Wait!
[9398.26s -> 9400.26s]  No it's not. Oh my god.
[9400.26s -> 9408.07s]  My whole body hurts.
[9408.07s -> 9410.07s]  Thank god you can't die by going in the water
[9410.07s -> 9412.95s]  in this game. I'm pressing A instead
[9412.95s -> 9414.95s]  of Y to pick shit up. Look at this thing.
[9414.95s -> 9420.33s]  I don't
[9420.33s -> 9422.33s]  know. Look at how big this turtle's
[9422.33s -> 9424.33s]  neck is. No that's not alive.
[9424.33s -> 9426.33s]  I thought that turtle was alive.
[9426.33s -> 9428.33s]  I was gonna say that is a fucked up looking
[9428.33s -> 9441.64s]  turtle. Can I...I can't...
[9441.64s -> 9451.48s]  Tre...Treasure Carp
[9451.48s -> 9455.26s]  Scale. Wait this is the
[9455.26s -> 9457.26s]  cookie bug. This is the new
[9457.26s -> 9459.26s]  bug from...Alright.
[9459.26s -> 9470.07s]  Bring it to somebody who knows what they're doing
[9470.07s -> 9472.07s]  and you can...Alright that's cool.
[9472.07s -> 9474.07s]  So it's a cookie fish now.
[9474.07s -> 9482.44s]  Look at that. Wouldn't even come over here
[9482.44s -> 9484.44s]  if it wasn't for the cookie fish.
[9484.44s -> 9490.95s]  Another one. Nice.
[9490.95s -> 9492.95s]  How far can you go? Is there an invisible wall?
[9492.95s -> 9498.95s]  Yeah.
[9498.95s -> 9510.02s]  Look at the other side. I don't think I can make it up there.
[9510.02s -> 9514.12s]  You can't grab that ledge? Yes
[9514.12s -> 9516.12s]  you can. You can't.
[9516.12s -> 9529.48s]  What are you dumb? Did I miss anything
[9529.48s -> 9535.56s]  over here? There's more shit over there though.
[9535.56s -> 9538.82s]  What are you dumb?
[9538.82s -> 9544.76s]  Let me get down here first.
[9544.76s -> 9546.76s]  There's like pirate boats over here with items.
[9546.76s -> 9549.00s]  Huh? Who?
[9549.00s -> 9551.00s]  Oh. You. Alright fine. Come down here.
[9551.00s -> 9555.35s]  Okay. Two seconds. Are you gonna come over here
[9555.35s -> 9557.35s]  or...You're not gonna aggro everyone
[9557.35s -> 9560.36s]  by doing this right? That'd be really
[9560.36s -> 9562.36s]  bad. Please don't.
[9562.36s -> 9573.61s]  You lost me. Good. That's a big
[9573.61s -> 9577.96s]  animal. Regular dog?
[9577.96s -> 9581.42s]  Just regular dog.
[9581.42s -> 9585.37s]  This guy's still finding
[9585.37s -> 9590.94s]  me. There's no fashion
[9590.94s -> 9592.94s]  Sekiro. Well that's
[9592.94s -> 9596.26s]  unfortunate. I'm one of these
[9599.27s -> 9606.38s]  magic find items.
[9606.38s -> 9614.25s]  I'm intrigued to go check over here.
[9614.25s -> 9621.67s]  Can I get up there? No? Could you
[9621.67s -> 9623.67s]  effectively just go all the way around and skip the whole thing?
[9623.67s -> 9632.95s]  Another coin purse.
[9632.95s -> 9634.95s]  Ooh! Secret fish.
[9634.95s -> 9646.90s]  No! No!
[9646.90s -> 9648.90s]  That was brutal. Who just? Was the fish just talking
[9648.90s -> 9665.46s]  to me?
[9665.46s -> 9669.75s]  Why? What?
[9669.75s -> 9678.07s]  Oh creepy.
[9678.07s -> 9683.43s]  Purchase items with scales.
[9683.43s -> 9687.02s]  Mask fragment.
[9687.02s -> 9690.47s]  Withered red
[9690.47s -> 9693.48s]  gourd.
[9693.48s -> 9695.48s]  Curved withered red gourd filled with medicinal water.
[9695.48s -> 9697.48s]  The gourd's medicine refills upon
[9697.48s -> 9700.30s]  rest. Reduces burn
[9700.30s -> 9702.30s]  buildup and slightly increases burn resistance.
[9702.30s -> 9704.30s]  It cannot heal the burn status
[9704.30s -> 9710.68s]  of its
[9710.68s -> 9714.71s]  divine grass. So this is a full
[9714.71s -> 9722.07s]  heal. So
[9722.07s -> 9728.02s]  this is a consumable though.
[9728.02s -> 9730.02s]  It's a scale to eat this and it's gone.
[9730.02s -> 9737.19s]  The original must have been broken
[9737.19s -> 9739.19s]  into several pieces and this fragment appears to be
[9739.19s -> 9741.19s]  the right side of the mask.
[9741.19s -> 9747.59s]  So this is a combat art floating passage.
[9747.59s -> 9749.96s]  Unleash attacks in a flowing
[9749.96s -> 9751.96s]  dance-like form, overwhelming enemies
[9751.96s -> 9754.52s]  in a furor of
[9754.52s -> 9762.39s]  graceful aggression.
[9762.39s -> 9769.37s]  What does the mask do? No idea.
[9769.37s -> 9771.37s]  Bring me some scales next time.
[9771.37s -> 9773.37s]  No Wikipedia to help us.
[9773.37s -> 9776.95s]  We just gotta play.
[9776.95s -> 9782.84s]  That's really cool though. What a cool character.
[9782.84s -> 9789.05s]  Uh, fish?
[9789.05s -> 9793.46s]  What was it? I just got
[9793.46s -> 9797.11s]  What was it? Did I lose my opportunity?
[9797.11s -> 9809.38s]  I gotta get out of the water.
[9809.38s -> 9811.38s]  Who is aggroing to me?
[9811.38s -> 9822.84s]  Let's get up here.
[9822.84s -> 9829.56s]  No I can't.
[9829.56s -> 9832.82s]  There it is. There it is.
[9832.82s -> 9837.30s]  Come here. Come on.
[9837.30s -> 9840.70s]  No. Damn it.
[9840.70s -> 9844.09s]  I gotta get up here and just wait.
[9844.09s -> 9852.46s]  Come on.
[9852.46s -> 9856.36s]  I need to kill you. You gotta come on.
[9856.36s -> 9861.22s]  Fishing quest. I know.
[9861.22s -> 9872.34s]  Really. There it is.
[9872.34s -> 9876.76s]  He's not at the surface though. I think he used to
[9876.76s -> 9878.76s]  actually pop up because I can't really hit him.
[9878.76s -> 9887.66s]  Drive the shuriken.
[9887.66s -> 9889.66s]  That's a good idea.
[9889.66s -> 9898.49s]  Because he's deep down there.
[9898.49s -> 9901.11s]  It just makes him go
[9901.11s -> 9909.75s]  real fast. I might just have to watch him
[9909.75s -> 9913.27s]  wait until he gets up. Hopefully he comes
[9913.27s -> 9918.20s]  back. It seems like he'll have to come
[9918.20s -> 9920.20s]  up a little higher to the surface.
[9920.20s -> 9935.03s]  Back? Just wait.
[9935.03s -> 9940.26s]  He gets a little closer.
[9940.26s -> 9942.26s]  I'm gonna leap out and smash him.
[9942.26s -> 9954.86s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[9954.86s -> 9958.63s]  Wait.
[9958.63s -> 9970.84s]  Come on. Just scream and charge him.
[9970.84s -> 9974.36s]  That's not gonna work.
[9974.36s -> 9976.73s]  Come to London. I've always wanted to
[9976.73s -> 9981.02s]  go to Europe. I'm not sure he's gonna get up.
[9981.02s -> 9987.98s]  He's gonna be right here.
[9987.98s -> 9989.98s]  Here we go. Here we go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9989.98s -> 9993.05s]  Fuck no. What?
[9993.05s -> 9997.66s]  How do I swing down?
[9997.66s -> 10005.78s]  I couldn't get it.
[10005.78s -> 10007.78s]  It's almost like I see him
[10007.78s -> 10009.78s]  slashing this way. I don't think you can
[10009.78s -> 10014.26s]  do that. Is there a way I can
[10014.26s -> 10016.57s]  swing down?
[10016.57s -> 10019.56s]  Maybe like that.
[10019.56s -> 10022.38s]  I hit the rod.
[10022.38s -> 10027.11s]  I don't buy that. Let me try doing that
[10027.11s -> 10035.75s]  combat art too. Come on.
[10035.75s -> 10037.75s]  I have to catch this fish. It's gonna drive me crazy.
[10037.75s -> 10039.75s]  There he is. Alright.
[10039.75s -> 10048.65s]  I'm gonna do the combat art too. I can't even see him.
[10048.65s -> 10050.65s]  I might have to just wait a little longer.
[10050.65s -> 10056.92s]  Just wait even longer.
[10056.92s -> 10058.92s]  He goes by here. He starts to come up a little bit.
[10058.92s -> 10067.50s]  This is just a fishing stream.
[10067.50s -> 10069.50s]  At the moment, yeah.
[10071.80s -> 10075.90s]  Alright. This is what happened last time.
[10075.90s -> 10079.80s]  He came up a little.
[10079.80s -> 10082.23s]  I saw it at him. Everybody just don't move.
[10082.23s -> 10093.10s]  Where'd he go?
[10093.10s -> 10101.46s]  Where'd he go? What?
[10101.46s -> 10103.46s]  Oh shit. How did he go by me?
[10103.46s -> 10108.90s]  Shallow water.
[10108.90s -> 10113.37s]  Fuck it. I'm going for it.
[10113.37s -> 10115.86s]  Got him. Nice.
[10115.86s -> 10118.49s]  Alright. Cool. I feel
[10118.49s -> 10120.49s]  complete.
[10120.49s -> 10126.31s]  Shut up, Oscar.
[10126.31s -> 10130.34s]  There might be another one.
[10130.34s -> 10135.53s]  Might as well check, right?
[10135.53s -> 10144.23s]  I can't see anymore.
[10144.23s -> 10152.98s]  There was one under here.
[10152.98s -> 10154.98s]  I'm gonna get the great rod. There is no great rod.
[10154.98s -> 10159.66s]  Just the great rod.
[10159.66s -> 10163.30s]  That's a lot of dogs up there.
[10163.30s -> 10165.30s]  I think I'm gonna just pull this guy.
[10165.30s -> 10167.30s]  No. How am I gonna effectively do this?
[10167.30s -> 10170.63s]  I gotta go around.
[10170.63s -> 10175.18s]  I just got three dogs with me.
[10175.18s -> 10178.63s]  Have I thought about visiting Singapore?
[10178.63s -> 10180.63s]  I wanna go everywhere.
[10180.63s -> 10182.63s]  But I wanna turn like 40 first.
[10182.63s -> 10184.81s]  You know? I wanna be one of those boomers
[10184.81s -> 10186.81s]  that just travels the world when he's like 45.
[10186.81s -> 10201.02s]  The guy with the three dogs
[10201.02s -> 10203.02s]  is right up here.
[10203.02s -> 10208.58s]  Maybe fighting's not the answer sometimes.
[10208.58s -> 10218.18s]  I can't grab that from here.
[10218.18s -> 10221.38s]  Okay. Here's the plan. Ready?
[10221.38s -> 10224.07s]  I'm gonna go in. I'm gonna do the weapon art
[10224.07s -> 10226.07s]  to all the dogs at the same time.
[10226.07s -> 10242.58s]  Nobody sees me yet. Perfect.
[10242.58s -> 10245.14s]  Oh shit.
[10245.14s -> 10247.14s]  That's the burn meter.
[10247.14s -> 10249.32s]  He got me with the burn. Really?
[10249.32s -> 10251.32s]  I'm burning now.
[10251.32s -> 10253.32s]  Fuck. Yeah.
[10253.32s -> 10255.32s]  I touched every...
[10255.32s -> 10257.32s]  Oh. I'm so mad about that.
[10257.32s -> 10263.34s]  Yeah. Resistance gauge.
[10263.34s -> 10265.34s]  There are two items which suppress the gauge
[10265.34s -> 10267.34s]  and cure, and I'm on fire.
[10267.34s -> 10270.92s]  I don't think I can get rid of this
[10270.92s -> 10272.92s]  until... How long does this last?
[10272.92s -> 10275.86s]  I dodged into every single one of those
[10275.86s -> 10278.10s]  somehow. It's definitely not that bad.
[10278.10s -> 10286.30s]  Enemies doused in oil easily set alight
[10286.30s -> 10288.30s]  causing them to take additional vitality
[10288.30s -> 10290.30s]  even from fire attacks.
[10290.30s -> 10292.92s]  Oil and they burn.
[10292.92s -> 10296.94s]  You got it.
[10296.94s -> 10299.43s]  Now, let me just get rid of this guy too.
[10299.43s -> 10311.85s]  I love games where stomping and dropping
[10311.85s -> 10313.85s]  actually works. Yeah.
[10313.85s -> 10316.15s]  And then it's pretty cool.
[10316.15s -> 10330.22s]  Nothing else.
[10330.22s -> 10332.22s]  I completely forgot this is almost a secondary
[10332.22s -> 10336.95s]  area that I don't have to be in right now.
[10336.95s -> 10338.95s]  My brain...
[10338.95s -> 10340.95s]  This is the next part of the game in my brain.
[10340.95s -> 10344.47s]  Why did I press down? Maybe it is.
[10344.47s -> 10359.00s]  Let's take a rest.
[10359.00s -> 10368.66s]  I'm good. 59 out of 15.
[10368.66s -> 10371.22s]  More ceramic shards.
[10371.22s -> 10374.23s]  Alright.
[10376.23s -> 10378.23s]  Is he screaming to let
[10378.23s -> 10380.23s]  everybody in or... That's a big
[10380.23s -> 10382.23s]  yell, right? Okay. Well, whatever.
[10382.23s -> 10384.79s]  Just come over here.
[10384.79s -> 10387.16s]  Is he opening the door? That door just
[10387.16s -> 10401.05s]  can't open. They just know that something's
[10401.05s -> 10403.05s]  going on over here. They can't do anything about it though.
[10403.05s -> 10406.74s]  I'm fine with that. Alright. Let's get out.
[10406.74s -> 10414.30s]  Alright. Any enemies down here?
[10414.30s -> 10418.70s]  No. Let's just check.
[10418.70s -> 10425.21s]  Ladder. Wall.
[10425.21s -> 10430.33s]  Just an item on a tree.
[10430.33s -> 10432.33s]  Ooh, thanks. I don't even know what it was.
[10432.33s -> 10444.54s]  What the hell was it?
[10444.54s -> 10446.54s]  You are so infected.
[10446.54s -> 10450.25s]  What? You mean me in real
[10450.25s -> 10452.25s]  life? I would agree with you. Something's wrong with me.
[10452.25s -> 10454.68s]  There's more sugar.
[10454.68s -> 10457.75s]  So this is... You take less damage.
[10457.75s -> 10459.75s]  This is just the damaged candy.
[10459.75s -> 10462.18s]  Three... Okay. It's in storage.
[10462.18s -> 10465.06s]  I need to save those
[10465.06s -> 10467.06s]  for bosses. I'm not taking those during regular
[10467.06s -> 10477.30s]  encounters. You want me to jump?
[10477.30s -> 10484.66s]  The only point of entry is up
[10484.66s -> 10487.67s]  here. So...
[10487.67s -> 10490.55s]  Remember I can go that way.
[10490.55s -> 10494.57s]  Ooh.
[10494.57s -> 10497.45s]  Let's be easy. Let's be easy.
[10497.45s -> 10502.70s]  Easy. Easy. Can I e-drop?
[10502.70s -> 10507.22s]  These guys talk to each other?
[10507.22s -> 10509.59s]  Who's more dangerous? I don't know.
[10509.59s -> 10522.01s]  Guy with the bow. Somebody's
[10522.01s -> 10532.63s]  looking at me. I left my favorite
[10532.63s -> 10534.63s]  YouTuber streamer.
[10534.63s -> 10537.19s]  I think it's streamer now.
[10537.19s -> 10542.23s]  Almost exclusively.
[10542.23s -> 10546.84s]  Doesn't open from this side. For now.
[10546.84s -> 10549.98s]  Streamtuber.
[10549.98s -> 10553.67s]  Um... Three.
[10553.67s -> 10557.32s]  Guy with the burn. That looks like
[10557.32s -> 10559.32s]  a shortcut. I wonder...
[10559.32s -> 10564.76s]  Let's go up this way.
[10564.76s -> 10567.19s]  Can I climb there?
[10567.19s -> 10569.62s]  I'll go down this way. Let's go.
[10569.62s -> 10572.76s]  Watch this. Ready? This is gonna be
[10572.76s -> 10585.93s]  so cool. Nevermind. More
[10585.93s -> 10591.37s]  sugar. Boosts attack power.
[10591.37s -> 10594.50s]  So this is a...
[10594.50s -> 10596.50s]  The fighting... The red sugar
[10596.50s -> 10599.26s]  is the fight sugar.
[10599.26s -> 10605.59s]  Wait. What's that? Three people.
[10605.59s -> 10607.59s]  Ah. Easy.
[10607.59s -> 10610.90s]  Climb up there. Come on. Give me a
[10610.90s -> 10616.92s]  point of access. Got no
[10616.92s -> 10622.04s]  access right there to climb? Come
[10622.04s -> 10624.22s]  on. How? There's gotta be
[10624.22s -> 10629.40s]  something I can jump up to. Not even the
[10629.40s -> 10631.83s]  tree? You're killing me.
[10631.83s -> 10645.78s]  I don't know what I'm doing right now,
[10645.78s -> 10647.78s]  but it's stupid, whatever it is.
[10647.78s -> 10659.80s]  I was just trying to
[10659.80s -> 10668.82s]  find a place to grapple.
[10668.82s -> 10670.82s]  I can't get on this house.
[10670.82s -> 10672.82s]  I thought I could. Alright, let's just talk.
[10672.82s -> 10675.45s]  Because you just gotta go in.
[10675.45s -> 10691.11s]  Watch out for this guy.
[10698.60s -> 10701.16s]  You're almost broken. That's great.
[10701.16s -> 10704.87s]  That was a Smash Brothers sound effect?
[10704.87s -> 10708.26s]  I don't even know what you're
[10708.26s -> 10713.75s]  talking about.
[10713.75s -> 10719.38s]  Some pellets. Good.
[10719.38s -> 10725.00s]  That'll help. They were dogs
[10725.00s -> 10736.26s]  though. Thought I could get over
[10736.26s -> 10738.26s]  there. Thought I could be cheeky about that.
[10738.26s -> 10750.23s]  Whoa!
[10750.23s -> 10752.73s]  I'm stuck on something there.
[10752.73s -> 10754.97s]  Did that guy just say waza?
[10754.97s -> 10756.97s]  Like the old Budweiser commercial?
[10756.97s -> 10771.37s]  Ooh! That hurts.
[10771.37s -> 10773.80s]  Alright.
[10773.80s -> 10775.80s]  Oh no, no, no.
[10775.80s -> 10788.15s]  Bad. Very bad.
[10788.15s -> 10791.93s]  Relax. This guy with a
[10791.93s -> 10799.99s]  bow and arrow or something over here.
[10799.99s -> 10801.99s]  I gotta go. I'm back on top of the house, please.
[10801.99s -> 10804.30s]  Actually, maybe not.
[10804.30s -> 10807.05s]  That's probably bad. I don't know.
[10807.05s -> 10809.05s]  I need to get the item in here.
[10809.05s -> 10811.05s]  Oh, come on.
[10811.05s -> 10825.77s]  With this accuracy.
[10825.77s -> 10828.65s]  I'm talking on the roof. Alright.
[10828.65s -> 10830.95s]  Fuck this guy.
[10830.95s -> 10856.68s]  Where are you locking on, game?
[10856.68s -> 10861.61s]  Holy shit,
[10861.61s -> 10873.83s]  a lot of people. Easy.
[10877.03s -> 10879.98s]  Fuck.
[10879.98s -> 10881.98s]  Just trying to do the art.
[10888.86s -> 10893.98s]  Ah!
[10893.98s -> 10900.25s]  Damn it, I didn't time it right.
[10900.25s -> 10902.25s]  That guy was shit-faced.
[10902.25s -> 10907.99s]  Yeah, he was pretty drunk.
[10907.99s -> 10910.36s]  Although, I'm kind of hurting for
[10910.36s -> 10918.66s]  health here.
[10918.66s -> 10925.13s]  Just one more guy, I think.
[10925.13s -> 10931.40s]  I feel bad for that guy.
[10931.40s -> 10933.40s]  But still, sometimes you gotta...
[10933.40s -> 10937.94s]  I hear another dog somewhere.
[10937.94s -> 10943.00s]  Burn powder.
[10943.00s -> 10947.14s]  In this room? No.
[10947.14s -> 10954.36s]  Okay, there we go. Pellet.
[10954.36s -> 10956.60s]  More items. Couple here.
[10956.60s -> 10958.90s]  This is the money pellet.
[10958.90s -> 10960.90s]  Flame barrel.
[10960.90s -> 10962.90s]  An iron barrel that spews fire?
[10962.90s -> 10964.90s]  Ooh! A new prosthetic.
[10964.90s -> 10968.49s]  It's difficult to control
[10968.49s -> 10970.49s]  the rage-filled red eyes
[10970.49s -> 10972.49s]  with the power of man alone.
[10972.49s -> 10974.49s]  A fire-based weapon could be a means of resisting them.
[10974.49s -> 10976.49s]  They're said to fear fire
[10976.49s -> 10983.02s]  above all else.
[10983.02s -> 10986.28s]  Well, I now have a new
[10986.28s -> 10993.83s]  toy to play with. I'm gonna heal.
[10993.83s -> 11001.26s]  There's another item over here.
[11001.26s -> 11005.99s]  I haven't used this once.
[11005.99s -> 11008.42s]  Just see what it does.
[11008.42s -> 11010.42s]  Every time I play one of these games, I just never use
[11010.42s -> 11012.42s]  the items that they give me.
[11012.42s -> 11014.42s]  And I end up with a thousand of them in my inventory.
[11014.42s -> 11021.32s]  Keep going.
[11021.32s -> 11025.22s]  Let's see what it does.
[11025.22s -> 11027.78s]  Looks like a distractor. That's actually
[11027.78s -> 11030.02s]  really good.
[11030.02s -> 11043.58s]  Phenomenal, actually.
[11043.58s -> 11047.74s]  Oh.
[11047.74s -> 11050.30s]  Worthless bastards.
[11050.30s -> 11052.30s]  Hello.
[11052.30s -> 11054.73s]  You are...
[11054.73s -> 11056.97s]  a shinobi, if...
[11056.97s -> 11058.97s]  if I have mistaken.
[11058.97s -> 11060.97s]  Take the shinobi axe
[11060.97s -> 11063.59s]  from the temple
[11063.59s -> 11066.73s]  and split it into
[11066.73s -> 11068.73s]  skulls wide open.
[11068.73s -> 11071.48s]  Please.
[11071.48s -> 11075.58s]  For a second, I thought you said, like, hug him.
[11075.58s -> 11077.88s]  Oh, okay.
[11077.88s -> 11079.88s]  Sorry that you died.
[11079.88s -> 11092.47s]  See anything?
[11092.47s -> 11096.38s]  Will he see me if I pop out here?
[11096.38s -> 11098.68s]  What is that?
[11098.68s -> 11103.67s]  Oh, he's trolling.
[11110.68s -> 11113.37s]  Alright, so something going on in there.
[11117.37s -> 11128.44s]  I'm gonna kill these guys.
[11128.44s -> 11130.44s]  There's more stuff over here, too.
[11130.44s -> 11132.44s]  There's an NPC over there. Alright, wait.
[11132.44s -> 11135.13s]  Let me get the... there's an item this way.
[11135.13s -> 11140.06s]  Let me just get up there.
[11140.06s -> 11147.35s]  Pick it up. Whatever it is.
[11147.35s -> 11155.48s]  Chicken. Another sugar.
[11155.48s -> 11158.62s]  So this reduces posture damage
[11158.62s -> 11162.14s]  taken. There's a lot of these candies.
[11169.62s -> 11171.62s]  Ah, hey, look at that.
[11171.62s -> 11173.80s]  I did it. I opened up
[11173.80s -> 11178.54s]  the shortcut. Remember this?
[11178.54s -> 11191.72s]  I remember.
[11191.72s -> 11195.37s]  Let's go
[11195.37s -> 11197.37s]  refill our stuff.
[11197.37s -> 11205.86s]  I also kind of want to...
[11205.86s -> 11207.86s]  I want to go see what this new toy
[11207.86s -> 11218.79s]  is. New toy?
[11218.79s -> 11225.64s]  Yeah.
[11256.57s -> 11259.45s]  That's how you go lucid, man.
[11259.45s -> 11262.26s]  Hey, next time you're in that
[11262.26s -> 11264.26s]  zone, look in a mirror
[11264.26s -> 11266.50s]  to get even more lucid.
[11266.50s -> 11268.50s]  Flip a couple of light switches. Look at a clock.
[11268.50s -> 11270.50s]  You'll get deeper into lucidity.
[11270.50s -> 11278.44s]  Actually, by the way, don't ever look at a mirror
[11278.44s -> 11280.44s]  if you're in a dream. It's terrifying.
[11280.44s -> 11282.44s]  You look like the Scream monster.
[11282.44s -> 11284.44s]  The guy from Scream with the Scream mask on.
[11284.44s -> 11286.44s]  It's horrible. Your brain doesn't
[11286.44s -> 11288.44s]  understand how to decipher
[11288.44s -> 11290.44s]  a mirror if you're in a dream. Try it.
[11290.44s -> 11292.44s]  If you want to be scared.
[11292.44s -> 11297.18s]  Alright, deals fire,
[11297.18s -> 11299.18s]  damage to enemies in a short range blast
[11299.18s -> 11302.12s]  while burning.
[11302.12s -> 11305.19s]  So let's create it.
[11305.19s -> 11313.32s]  I can have three of these, right? You've never seen
[11313.32s -> 11315.32s]  a mirror in your dream? I'm telling you, if you want
[11315.32s -> 11317.32s]  to scare the shit out of yourself,
[11317.32s -> 11319.69s]  if you ever find yourself lucid
[11319.69s -> 11321.69s]  in a dream, go look in a mirror.
[11321.69s -> 11325.72s]  You will probably immediately wake up
[11325.72s -> 11330.46s]  because it's going to be a horror movie.
[11330.46s -> 11332.46s]  Okay, let's see.
[11332.46s -> 11335.85s]  Let's equip it. So this
[11335.85s -> 11337.85s]  costs three spirit emblems.
[11337.85s -> 11339.85s]  Whoa.
[11339.85s -> 11344.31s]  That's cool.
[11344.31s -> 11351.86s]  I kind of want to just try it. It's a cool way to switch.
[11351.86s -> 11357.86s]  Alright.
[11357.86s -> 11366.68s]  Back to it. Let's rest up.
[11366.68s -> 11370.33s]  Thermal lucid.
[11370.33s -> 11373.83s]  No.
[11373.83s -> 11375.83s]  What about skills? Okay, I can do...
[11375.83s -> 11379.80s]  Wait a minute. Mid-air
[11379.80s -> 11382.30s]  deflection. Allows one to
[11382.30s -> 11384.30s]  guard against or deflect enemy attacks
[11384.30s -> 11386.30s]  in mid-air.
[11386.30s -> 11391.48s]  That sounds pretty great. What's this one?
[11391.48s -> 11395.51s]  A Shinobi's Karma
[11395.51s -> 11400.57s]  body. Max spirit
[11400.57s -> 11404.22s]  emblems. Interesting.
[11404.22s -> 11407.67s]  What about down here? Let me look at what some
[11407.67s -> 11410.36s]  of these do. That's cool.
[11410.36s -> 11414.78s]  Run and slide. Allows one to
[11414.78s -> 11416.78s]  slide into a crouch position while
[11416.78s -> 11418.78s]  sprinting. Sprint through an
[11418.78s -> 11420.78s]  area and slide into cover or otherwise out
[11420.78s -> 11422.78s]  of view. Easily deceives
[11422.78s -> 11426.68s]  an enemy's eyes. Reduces an enemy's
[11426.68s -> 11428.68s]  ability to perceive those who are in stealth.
[11428.68s -> 11432.39s]  I kind of like being able to deflect
[11432.39s -> 11434.82s]  in the air.
[11434.82s -> 11436.82s]  But I'm going to hold on.
[11436.82s -> 11447.19s]  Not yet.
[11447.19s -> 11449.37s]  Am I still in Anor Londo?
[11449.37s -> 11451.37s]  I don't know how you could classify
[11451.37s -> 11457.96s]  this area. You could classify
[11457.96s -> 11459.96s]  this area as...I'm not sure.
[11459.96s -> 11464.82s]  I'm going to try this move though.
[11464.82s -> 11467.64s]  Ready? Let's see what that
[11467.64s -> 11469.64s]  does. Short range, right?
[11469.64s -> 11476.30s]  So it's kind of just like a blast.
[11476.30s -> 11482.36s]  Pretty long line there too.
[11486.84s -> 11493.82s]  You've got to be
[11493.82s -> 11495.82s]  real close. That's...
[11495.82s -> 11497.82s]  It's a dodge. And then
[11497.82s -> 11499.82s]  from the dodge you've got to be ready to go
[11499.82s -> 11508.58s]  and get hit.
[11508.58s -> 11510.95s]  Alright, let's skip this.
[11510.95s -> 11512.95s]  He tried to backstep. Yeah, I did.
[11512.95s -> 11517.24s]  You're right. Alright, he's going to go through the door.
[11517.24s -> 11519.24s]  That's now open.
[11519.24s -> 11521.24s]  I can just probably sneak around here, right?
[11521.24s -> 11525.14s]  Don't need to fight anything.
[11525.14s -> 11527.64s]  There's your pyromancy. Yeah.
[11527.64s -> 11531.61s]  Pretty much. I can't get there from here.
[11531.61s -> 11535.96s]  Come on.
[11535.96s -> 11537.96s]  Come on. It's right there.
[11537.96s -> 11539.96s]  I can't reach the roof here.
[11539.96s -> 11541.96s]  What are you thinking?
[11541.96s -> 11545.54s]  Wait. Yes I can.
[11545.54s -> 11549.19s]  Game doesn't suck.
[11549.19s -> 11556.86s]  What do you know? We
[11556.86s -> 11563.83s]  carry on. Alright, there was an
[11563.83s -> 11566.84s]  NPC.
[11566.84s -> 11570.30s]  There's a chicken. Well, I'm
[11570.30s -> 11572.30s]  going to go over here.
[11572.30s -> 11592.65s]  I bumped into everything in his house.
[11592.65s -> 11595.21s]  He's just kind of standing there going
[11595.21s -> 11597.21s]  well, you know, somebody
[11597.21s -> 11599.21s]  fucked up my house. Destroyed all
[11599.21s -> 11601.21s]  my stuff.
[11601.21s -> 11606.44s]  Sucks. I don't even know
[11606.44s -> 11618.09s]  what the hell he's looking at.
[11618.09s -> 11620.33s]  Way! Way!
[11620.33s -> 11628.84s]  Way!
[11628.84s -> 11630.84s]  Wait, you can come this way?
[11639.99s -> 11641.99s]  Somehow, instinctively, for no reason
[11641.99s -> 11643.99s]  started to try to attack with R1.
[11643.99s -> 11647.38s]  Which
[11647.38s -> 11649.38s]  that's a long time.
[11649.38s -> 11651.88s]  You are
[11651.88s -> 11653.88s]  hard to parry.
[11653.88s -> 11657.34s]  Jesus.
[11664.89s -> 11667.06s]  Oh my
[11667.06s -> 11669.06s]  Lord. Where? God. Come on.
[11681.77s -> 11693.03s]  Fuck me. I feel like trapped in the corner
[11693.03s -> 11695.03s]  over here. With two different elevations.
[11695.03s -> 11697.03s]  You know what I mean? Like boom, boom.
[11697.03s -> 11700.17s]  Oh, fuck off, game.
[11700.17s -> 11727.24s]  He's PG.
[11727.24s -> 11739.51s]  No, not right now.
[11739.51s -> 11742.33s]  What's in here? Ooh, a secret.
[11742.33s -> 11747.82s]  There's the axe.
[11747.82s -> 11749.82s]  Fuck off, game. Means game sucks.
[11749.82s -> 11752.38s]  No. It means fuck off
[11752.38s -> 11754.62s]  for that moment. I found the axe.
[11754.62s -> 11757.75s]  It's another tool. Less for cutting
[11757.75s -> 11759.75s]  and more for breaking things with its weight.
[11759.75s -> 11761.75s]  Once the favorite weapon of a shinobi, known as
[11761.75s -> 11763.75s]  the bounding monkey
[11763.75s -> 11765.75s]  of the sunken valley, he was lost along with his left
[11765.75s -> 11770.17s]  arm. Okay, so
[11770.17s -> 11772.86s]  there's another two tools here.
[11772.86s -> 11779.32s]  That's pretty cool. Wasn't there
[11779.32s -> 11781.32s]  somebody just walking over here looking at this?
[11781.32s -> 11784.01s]  It was an NPC.
[11784.01s -> 11788.79s]  Maybe not. Well, let's get rid of the
[11788.79s -> 11801.08s]  chicken. If I die to this chicken, I swear
[11801.08s -> 11807.54s]  to god.
[11807.54s -> 11810.10s]  You killed my brothers!
[11810.10s -> 11812.10s]  Don't make jokes here because I actually could die.
[11812.10s -> 11814.65s]  Oh, no.
[11814.65s -> 11816.65s]  So god damn it, please.
[11816.65s -> 11818.65s]  Please not the chicken. Please.
[11818.65s -> 11836.42s]  There's another one in there.
[11836.42s -> 11843.34s]  That's king chicken.
[11843.34s -> 11847.75s]  Do they live in this house?
[11847.75s -> 11849.75s]  Stop! You violated the law!
[11849.75s -> 11853.66s]  Can I stealth kill this chicken?
[11853.66s -> 11858.90s]  Come on,
[11858.90s -> 11860.90s]  let me stealth kill him.
[11860.90s -> 11871.34s]  No! Something has to be in this
[11871.34s -> 11878.12s]  house. Why would this be here?
[11878.12s -> 11882.41s]  There's nothing in the chicken house.
[11882.41s -> 11888.34s]  Really? Yes, there is.
[11888.34s -> 11901.02s]  More sugar. What about the people
[11901.02s -> 11903.02s]  that were back here?
[11903.02s -> 11907.50s]  I think they're still here. Yeah, see?
[11907.50s -> 11909.50s]  Okay. So this is the way to go
[11909.50s -> 11911.50s]  to progress. It's just straight through.
[11911.50s -> 11913.93s]  I cleaned up everything.
[11913.93s -> 11915.93s]  Now, speaking of cleaning,
[11915.93s -> 11918.10s]  let's clean up some
[11918.10s -> 11920.47s]  braid matter off
[11920.47s -> 11925.08s]  of our sword.
[11925.08s -> 11949.98s]  What is that lit up for?
[11949.98s -> 11951.98s]  Amnesium?
[11951.98s -> 11957.02s]  He's not bad.
[11957.02s -> 11960.60s]  He's highly skilled.
[11960.60s -> 11962.60s]  Just let me do one more taken.
[11962.60s -> 11964.60s]  Just one more, I swear. That'll be it.
[11964.60s -> 11969.85s]  We can put it in
[11969.85s -> 11971.85s]  feudal Japan.
[11971.85s -> 11973.85s]  Please write the script. Please.
[11973.85s -> 11981.38s]  Yes.
[11989.10s -> 11991.10s]  We've got a blood-borne window NPC.
[11996.04s -> 11999.88s]  Trader. Hey.
[11999.88s -> 12002.38s]  You. You're the young master
[12002.38s -> 12004.38s]  Shinobi. Yes.
[12004.38s -> 12007.19s]  What good are you? Wait.
[12007.19s -> 12009.19s]  Tell me you didn't leave. The timing of their
[12009.19s -> 12011.43s]  attack was perfect. Yes.
[12011.43s -> 12016.23s]  I hope. I would love if
[12016.23s -> 12018.23s]  you heard like...
[12018.23s -> 12020.86s]  And then it made like the soul collection
[12020.86s -> 12027.06s]  noise that like...
[12027.06s -> 12029.06s]  I hope you die
[12029.06s -> 12033.22s]  twice. I hope
[12033.22s -> 12035.22s]  you die twice.
[12035.22s -> 12039.96s]  Well,
[12039.96s -> 12041.96s]  let's see what's going on
[12041.96s -> 12046.55s]  over here.
[12069.69s -> 12072.82s]  Okay.
[12072.82s -> 12074.82s]  Okay.
[12081.64s -> 12084.58s]  Okay.
[12092.04s -> 12094.04s]  May the force be with you.
[12094.04s -> 12098.07s]  You as well. So everyone's kind of just
[12098.07s -> 12105.62s]  locked away right now.
[12105.62s -> 12107.62s]  And may the force be with you. And also with you.
[12107.62s -> 12110.31s]  Can I open the door?
[12110.31s -> 12112.31s]  Will that alert the horde? Oh, wait.
[12112.31s -> 12114.31s]  Right. They're just standing out there.
[12114.31s -> 12116.68s]  You can just hear me.
[12116.68s -> 12118.68s]  I think I heard something behind this door.
[12118.68s -> 12121.37s]  Maybe.
[12121.37s -> 12127.70s]  All right. Let's go for a drop-down kill.
[12127.70s -> 12130.97s]  Get the big guy
[12130.97s -> 12132.97s]  first, I'd say.
[12132.97s -> 12134.97s]  Yeah. Big guy first.
[12134.97s -> 12152.74s]  Hiya! Hiya!
[12152.74s -> 12154.74s]  I can't do that with the cold.
[12154.74s -> 12165.56s]  I was doing fucks.
[12165.56s -> 12167.93s]  I'm gonna say it this way.
[12167.93s -> 12169.93s]  No. You just gotta... No.
[12169.93s -> 12174.26s]  No. No. No.
[12174.26s -> 12178.10s]  Come on. Just one at a time.
[12178.10s -> 12182.46s]  Let me just throw... I'm gonna... Come here.
[12182.46s -> 12187.37s]  On the back. Bring it on.
[12196.20s -> 12198.20s]  Can you deflect that?
[12198.20s -> 12201.27s]  I haven't even attempted to.
[12201.27s -> 12215.93s]  It does burn you though.
[12215.93s -> 12217.93s]  This dude's got a shield.
[12217.93s -> 12221.38s]  How do you break shields?
[12221.38s -> 12227.14s]  Come on down the stairs.
[12227.14s -> 12229.90s]  One shield at a time.
[12229.90s -> 12235.13s]  Please.
[12235.13s -> 12240.31s]  You're so slow.
[12240.31s -> 12242.31s]  You're so slow!
[12242.31s -> 12244.31s]  Get down here! What an idiot.
[12244.31s -> 12251.91s]  He's almost broken.
[12251.91s -> 12256.52s]  Just... Really?
[12256.52s -> 12262.79s]  Fine. Fuck it.
[12262.79s -> 12270.49s]  Oh my God!
[12270.49s -> 12297.24s]  Why do you have so much reach?
[12297.24s -> 12299.80s]  What am I supposed to do against this guy?
[12299.80s -> 12305.93s]  Um... Dodge around him?
[12305.93s -> 12307.93s]  And hit him in the back, probably?
[12307.93s -> 12310.55s]  Deflect and then break it eventually?
[12310.55s -> 12314.26s]  What is this idiot?
[12314.26s -> 12316.89s]  I think I just got hurt by stepping on a piece of metal.
[12316.89s -> 12318.89s]  It's a big thrust.
[12318.89s -> 12325.91s]  Push.
[12325.91s -> 12331.10s]  That hurts a lot.
[12331.10s -> 12333.10s]  I feel like there's a way easier way to do this.
[12333.10s -> 12335.10s]  Yeah, I just gotta wait till they go...
[12335.10s -> 12340.98s]  Get out of the way.
[12340.98s -> 12343.48s]  Come on. Do something.
[12343.48s -> 12353.66s]  One of you do something.
[12353.66s -> 12360.50s]  Before I go mad.
[12360.50s -> 12376.89s]  Of course it does!
[12376.89s -> 12378.89s]  Hey, let's do a puppet show for him!
[12378.89s -> 12380.89s]  Fuck you!
[12380.89s -> 12387.80s]  He killed me again. I swear to fucking God.
[12387.80s -> 12400.09s]  Ugh!
[12400.09s -> 12402.09s]  Burn!
[12402.09s -> 12404.09s]  Use jump.
[12404.09s -> 12413.62s]  He blocks it.
[12413.62s -> 12419.13s]  Ow!
[12419.13s -> 12421.56s]  What the fuck?
[12421.56s -> 12424.44s]  What?
[12424.44s -> 12437.93s]  Unseen aid.
[12437.93s -> 12443.11s]  I have to use the axe that I just got.
[12443.11s -> 12445.11s]  I'm getting a break.
[12445.11s -> 12456.14s]  Half of skill, experience, and scent are lost upon death, but there is a way to avoid this on rare occasions.
[12456.14s -> 12461.66s]  Through the unseen aid of gods and Buddha, one may be spared this loss.
[12461.66s -> 12465.96s]  The chances of receiving unseen aid can be seen in the pause menu.
[12465.96s -> 12472.70s]  So I have to go get the dumb axe to break the shield.
[12472.70s -> 12474.70s]  Otherwise they just do a puppet show for five minutes.
[12474.70s -> 12477.19s]  So wait a minute.
[12477.19s -> 12483.02s]  Okay, acquired skills, right?
[12483.02s -> 12495.24s]  Unseen aid. So there's a 30% chance that when you die twice, you get to come back without losing anything.
[12495.24s -> 12497.24s]  So I didn't lose anything.
[12497.24s -> 12499.24s]  Alright.
[12499.24s -> 12504.23s]  Let me go put on the mandatory item.
[12504.23s -> 12506.23s]  He just lost a lot of respect.
[12506.23s -> 12516.86s]  Don't call him Pinshield.
[12516.86s -> 12518.86s]  Look, how was I supposed to...
[12518.86s -> 12520.86s]  I gotta like put this axe on.
[12520.86s -> 12524.62s]  One strike and easily turn a wooden shield into splinters.
[12524.62s -> 12526.62s]  Ugh.
[12526.62s -> 12528.62s]  That's such dog shit.
[12528.62s -> 12537.38s]  What?
[12537.38s -> 12542.14s]  A book of secrets that details a variety of techniques for use with Shinobi prosthetic.
[12542.14s -> 12545.14s]  Grants the ability to learn prosthetic skills.
[12545.14s -> 12547.14s]  You can also use it as a weapon.
[12547.14s -> 12550.20s]  You can also use it as a weapon.
[12550.20s -> 12554.42s]  You can also use it as a weapon.
[12554.42s -> 12556.42s]  A variety of techniques for use with Shinobi prosthetic.
[12556.42s -> 12564.87s]  Grants the ability to learn prosthetic style skills.
[12589.40s -> 12591.40s]  Okay.
[12591.40s -> 12603.58s]  um thanks for everything i mean wait wait don't just skip it so it's too emblem to do it big
[12603.58s -> 12616.87s]  strike breaks shields very cool let's get it on there i'm ready i'm ready to go and fight the enemy
[12617.51s -> 12632.63s]  but first let's see i have two points there's another skeletonry prosthetic arts
[12633.51s -> 12638.34s]  i should have a martial art that allows one to perform a forward dashing sword slice after
[12638.34s -> 12643.46s]  using a certain prosthetic tools allowing one to close distance on enemies instantly
[12646.02s -> 12658.54s]  oh so you can throw a shuriken and then dive in that sounds really great actually uses the grappling
[12658.54s -> 12663.10s]  hook to launch oneself add an enemy and use that momentum to perform a rolling sword attack
[12665.13s -> 12678.44s]  oh that sounds actually really fun i mean that's the ability to grapple into and do the spider-man
[12678.44s -> 12699.69s]  move to people i'm doing it what does that open up here nightjar slash
[12702.02s -> 12705.38s]  spinning leap attack that can quickly close or create distance from foes
[12706.18s -> 12714.68s]  use the weight of the massive shuriken to add force to the blow so you just leap forward what's
[12714.68s -> 12722.92s]  this one of course the healing effects of recovery items that's almost necessary in these games
[12731.03s -> 12765.74s]  oh okay i'm ready necessary yeah all right let's go skip this bullshit get to the shield guys
[12768.28s -> 12801.43s]  break their shields break their necks doesn't matter to me bring it on do something what okay

[12875.78s -> 12887.72s]  through it you know let's just take a look i'm here the goal is not to get to the end as fast
[12887.72s -> 12892.60s]  as possible the goal is to enjoy the experience so let's just see if there's anything over here
[12893.24s -> 12916.82s]  there is what was that oh scale no that's just an angry fish no scale the mad fish
[12918.98s -> 12969.46s]  there's a tree here though what would this be here for um i there's somebody in here can i eavesdrop
[12969.46s -> 12981.80s]  on this person come on come on i'm right here really are you just weirdly pushed against the
[12981.80s -> 12991.67s]  wall where i can't do this if anyone's gonna get out they're only going to use this cave
[12991.67s -> 13010.98s]  don't let a single racket this cave this is the way to get out i don't love this guy brand
[13016.55s -> 13024.92s]  i didn't know there were this many people only two people were talking oh this is bad news now
[13025.80s -> 13041.51s]  oh it's so slow
[13043.91s -> 13053.38s]  guy with the bow gotta go now that's so important
[13062.33s -> 13067.29s]  it's so hard to time that in a game that's a thousand miles per hour in fighting
[13068.25s -> 13101.26s]  watching the guy slowly swing his fucking stick at you these two left
[13101.26s -> 13143.93s]  my god it's like he comes he's in slow motion where am i going all right there's like there's
[13143.93s -> 13152.52s]  a wizard down here why is there a wizard over here i don't know what to do about this should
[13152.52s -> 13180.09s]  i fight uh fight the wizard uh the thrust holy shit i'm gonna die wow
[13180.09s -> 13188.44s]  oh
[13203.69s -> 13222.17s]  holy shit this guy's insane did i just get a scripted wizard death
[13225.05s -> 13257.53s]  your death is not your fate just yet you died twice game over
[13261.94s -> 13268.68s]  wrought essence somewhere a pained cough rings out continuously the man who coughs
[13268.68s -> 13275.08s]  zealously sculpt statues of buddha to avoid being consumed by the building flames owning
[13275.08s -> 13285.99s]  this item reduces one's chance of receiving unseen aid wrought essence timid mane so wait they're
[13285.99s -> 13295.88s]  like dying or one with the power of the dragon's heritage dies the more a sickness known as dragon
[13295.88s -> 13302.04s]  rot spreads through the world if one known to the wolf is coughing and wheezing it's likely they are
[13302.04s -> 13307.72s]  afflicted with dragon rot the more wrought essence wolf has the lower the chance of receiving unseen
[13307.72s -> 13325.66s]  aid okay what's wrong dragon rot the stagnation overflows spreads the disease that leads eventually
[13325.66s -> 13336.46s]  death what you don't need to worry about me i'm not normal you see the more that i die the more
[13337.42s -> 13349.37s]  ask him about the rest i got so shit on by that guy he just attacked so many times in a row
[13350.09s -> 13361.67s]  have you seen the sculptor lately yes he's all i know is what dogan told me long ago
[13361.67s -> 13368.39s]  that the dragon's heritage can bestow the power of resurrection however it is not any ordinary
[13368.39s -> 13374.79s]  it kills everybody else needs to stagnation which will eventually reach a point where it
[13374.79s -> 13383.29s]  overflow this causes those who do not have the power to become sick a disease known as dragon
[13383.29s -> 13391.13s]  rot he knew much about it but even so he was so there is a penalty for using a cure forgive me
[13391.13s -> 13399.45s]  is there a way to treat this dragon rot i do not know it must be stopped i am unsure
[13399.45s -> 13405.69s]  for dying but the first step is to look through my mentor's research and see if i can discover
[13405.69s -> 13415.21s]  a way thank you just don't die easy i'm gonna lose i'm gonna have zero dollars by the end of
[13415.21s -> 13430.30s]  this playthrough i bet you anything i bet you i have five cents when this is all said and done
[13430.30s -> 13433.66s]  all right i feel like i probably shouldn't i need to go down and fight the wizard again
[13433.66s -> 13482.20s]  i mean how am i gonna just not have that happen uh shit try it again i have dragon rot let's keep
[13482.20s -> 13511.19s]  moving nice knowing you same two idiots okay back where i was before i'm gonna get embarrassed
[13511.19s -> 13532.07s]  again here um all right hold on grab this should i go that way i feel like i'm i have to get my
[13532.07s -> 13539.34s]  revenge even if it means killing every single person in the town by dragon rot i'm gonna die
[13539.34s -> 13556.78s]  like 30 times here i have to get my revenge on this guy i don't even know where the hell that was
[13558.66s -> 13575.86s]  where the fuck was that remember was down here yeah no it wasn't no yeah it was okay
[13576.98s -> 13588.18s]  all right all right all right this time don't fuck it all up forget about see i came in here
[13588.18s -> 13597.43s]  with a bunch of issues stealth kill this guy and then go get the wizard who can see me that makes
[13597.43s -> 13604.31s]  no who is even looking at me hey yeah you're trying to tell me the fish down there is is
[13604.31s -> 13633.90s]  seeing me right now the fish yeah let's go i wonder what's the wizard vulnerable to oh my god what
[13633.90s -> 13652.97s]  am i doing what this there's too many fucking people here what was are you serious how was
[13652.97s -> 13657.45s]  i ever gonna do that i don't even know where i'm going right now i'm so lost where we even was that
[13659.83s -> 13683.22s]  executive wall jump where why am i doing this hello um am i supposed to be here
[13685.93s -> 13719.35s]  okay i don't know where this is because i got another sculptor's idol uh any items that i can
[13719.35s -> 13735.91s]  get the fire looks beautiful that's too busy paying attention to how wonderful looking your game world
[13735.91s -> 13759.00s]  was from software and you put an archer right next to me that's a lot of people oh my nice eagle
[13759.00s -> 13766.52s]  eye of course the guy with the fucking eagle eye really he has no line of sight on me he can't see
[13766.52s -> 13780.01s]  me and he's just shooting the wall that's unbelievable they shoot so much faster too
[13781.29s -> 13791.27s]  now i'm fucked oh i'm fucked here fighting more than one enemy in this game
[13792.23s -> 13803.16s]  there's like no way good luck what i got predicted i got predicted
[13805.69s -> 13811.30s]  holy shit oh my fucking god
[13828.20s -> 13834.92s]  come on why i i didn't know it was gonna happen you don't even have like one second of immunity
[13835.88s -> 13847.86s]  you don't have like a half second of immunity all right i can have a different approach to this
[13847.86s -> 13863.45s]  because this seems almost almost undoable you're gonna have to pick people up one by one you can't
[13863.45s -> 13871.50s]  you can't just walk up there no way give me my other tools i'm gonna have to do a pole here
[13872.30s -> 13897.75s]  i could do one or two at a time i need more than that that's an uh-uh let's go
[13898.31s -> 13915.99s]  if it didn't matter jesus i didn't see you
[13921.35s -> 13924.47s]  and i knew he's gonna shoot at me too
[13942.36s -> 13971.11s]  you fuck you all right so far so good watch out for hawkeye don't i have to grapple move to
[13984.63s -> 14012.42s]  music stop which means i'm safe almost not completely almost born that's burn powder
[14012.42s -> 14016.18s]  there's a lot of fire here something tells me i'm probably gonna need to use this
[14016.98s -> 14033.50s]  i gotta get my inventory ready is that maybe just go through the house almost incompatible
[14034.14s -> 14048.44s]  divine confetti made for driving away apparitions the paper is made ceremoniously
[14048.44s -> 14058.26s]  whereby pulp is spread thin using water from the exalted fountain head so this is to be able to hit
[14058.26s -> 14070.62s]  ghosts why is there you swing through this wall the whole the game's getting a full letter grade
[14070.62s -> 14108.78s]  downgrade anymore i see something oh that's just more of that okay no more enemies there's a bunch
[14108.78s -> 14119.45s]  of shit illusory wall i didn't clear everything over here though i'm gonna get spotted by something
[14120.25s -> 14149.75s]  maybe not it's down here nothing uh is there more i guess i can go this way
[14150.55s -> 14162.63s]  i don't know there's even more of these idiots over here well i'm gonna have to start pulling
[14162.63s -> 14186.52s]  people is sakiro the bad guy or the good guy he's an anti-hero he could be anything no no no calm
[14186.52s -> 14207.00s]  down i bumped into a fucking piece of plastic let's get a pirate here
[14207.88s -> 14224.84s]  i figured these guys out you just gotta get that lunge and insta-kill them i i'm not opening one of
[14224.84s -> 14258.30s]  those coin sacks try me until i'm gonna until i need them um who's drunk who's drunk joe's with
[14258.30s -> 14280.71s]  a drunkard i think i may have bumped out an economy um i well he certainly is drunk yeah
[14281.83s -> 14286.47s]  he certainly had a fuse to drink do i have to fight everybody in here
[14288.01s -> 14303.61s]  uh is he gonna do we all fight i'm confused right now it what is he doing is he stuck
[14304.57s -> 14314.22s]  so this is not a scenario where uh joe's who the drunkard comes out and kills everybody
[14314.22s -> 14331.53s]  and invites him that i miss that did i miss a cut scene i may have missed cuts i find him in the
[14331.53s -> 14343.24s]  hallway um this is bad this is very bad uh are you sure i don't get a like gun in this game
[14344.04s -> 14355.00s]  because that's how i would see completing this well got to deal with it right
[14367.86s -> 14404.41s]  as long as he stays stuck on stairs and shit i can care less who's next just me and you um all
[14404.41s -> 14413.61s]  right let's see what you got what moves do you got you got an acid spit he spits it two times
[14414.57s -> 14421.88s]  that lingers for a while too so this guy can be anti-poison that doesn't really hurt him
[14422.12s -> 14439.90s]  so wow that's a push okay he drinks i'm almost dead that was uh i could have gone a little better
[14441.18s -> 14466.57s]  shit i don't even know how i even happened i he like got stuck in the wall and then i had to
[14466.57s -> 14486.92s]  fight like six people i thought i was like if i ran into the middle it was gonna do like a
[14487.56s -> 14495.38s]  cut scene or something apparently not let me just see how that is supposed to work
[14496.02s -> 14522.63s]  yeah under a potential normal circumstance hold on so i'm realizing right now this whole this area
[14522.63s -> 14529.91s]  sucks can i just run by these guys or do i have to deal with this every time
[14530.87s -> 14539.88s]  like this gotta be a way i can jump over that again i can just run
[14540.76s -> 14546.57s]  how am i supposed to deal with this part and it's just kind of stealth to take out everybody
[14555.13s -> 14570.23s]  what oh hi hi there you want really come on i'm talking to an npc
[14571.35s -> 14599.13s]  i'm gonna kill the npc accidentally this is oh my god can i i just want to hear what the fuck
[14599.13s -> 14612.10s]  this guy has to say let me explain i want one of you guys to go to med school become a doctor
[14612.18s -> 14617.62s]  and explain how i was not locked onto that guy what happened go be a scientist go do game go
[14617.62s -> 14621.06s]  do like 50 years of game development and then figure out what just happened right there
[14621.62s -> 14647.27s]  are you gonna fund it my controller has low battery my controller doesn't have low battery
[14648.15s -> 14655.67s]  it's plugged into the wall or whatever into the computer it doesn't have low battery who's
[14655.67s -> 14700.36s]  fighting me oh my god fuck this area i'm gonna come back and
[14701.08s -> 14705.00s]  fucking slit this guy's throat when i'm like 15 levels higher no fuck this place
[14705.00s -> 14719.38s]  this place sucks there was another way i could go it's just they just just throw up like fucking
[14719.38s -> 14725.21s]  20 enemies in a fire zone and then a big fat guy comes out and drinks no i need i want to hear
[14725.21s -> 14745.56s]  what that guy has to say i want to listen i want to hear the npc can i get over there through this
[14745.56s -> 14755.08s]  way i have to be able to right i swear to god if this is one of those scenarios where i have to go
[14755.08s -> 14761.10s]  get like another weapon art thing and i just fucking i throw like a grenade at him or something
[14761.10s -> 14784.44s]  and he instantly dies i'm gonna be upset i don't think i can jump over that okay where is he let's
[14784.44s -> 14791.08s]  listen to this guy let's get away from these people hide wait just deflect where are they
[14791.08s -> 14794.20s]  they're gonna come over here and yeah there they are he's gonna shoot me through the bush
[14794.20s -> 14818.14s]  it's just one guy and he still has his sights on that's fine just talk to me so i can figure out
[14819.18s -> 14823.18s]  what i need to do here there's definitely something to do i have to like pull a lever
[14823.74s -> 14832.14s]  and a big log is gonna come crashing down from a tree that's right i can't move when you're in a
[14832.14s -> 14838.98s]  conversation with an npc they've made five of these games you can move when talking to people what
[14869.94s -> 14875.54s]  is to protect me yeah you can do something about it please never forgive me should i fail
[14876.98s -> 14885.18s]  i found the secret i found the way i found the way i found the way to do it all right we fight
[14885.18s -> 14889.90s]  together me and this guy i knew there was something weird going on but why didn't he uh
[14890.46s -> 14894.14s]  i hope he doesn't get his ass kicked wait wait wait wait wait can he just beat him for me
[14895.58s -> 14904.23s]  no no no no no he's gonna die i i wasn't prepared for this he's gonna get it like three
[14904.23s -> 14916.63s]  times and die what is the lock on doing why is the lock on this is i i don't like this lock on
[14916.63s -> 14927.22s]  very much i'm gonna be completely honest here it like keeps taking itself off of people he's dead
[14930.55s -> 14939.24s]  are you kidding me this is on by default no it's not oh fuck off game
[14954.63s -> 14957.59s]  kill all the minions then recruit the guy i didn't even know that's what it did
[14957.59s -> 15013.54s]  oh god that voice is gonna kill me he doesn't have fire i don't have any healing left or anything
[15013.54s -> 15019.05s]  either all right so i i know i have a basic understanding of how to fight
[15022.58s -> 15027.70s]  i'm gonna clear the people that are over here and then recruit them and then fight
[15028.74s -> 15039.22s]  be lucky that you can give one hit on see if i can
[15041.64s -> 15059.16s]  kill this dude i'm trying well that's a grab i somehow got
[15061.24s -> 15071.75s]  me poison spit i wonder if fire will work here even if i get a good dodge
[15074.22s -> 15104.68s]  do you want to grab oh you gotta just dodge those here we go i can pause the game all right let me see
[15105.48s -> 15112.87s]  get all this shit out of here i don't even i can't even yeah i have a healing pellet
[15114.01s -> 15128.39s]  um all right oil oil and then burn them maybe i wonder i'm gonna try covering with oil and burn
[15128.39s -> 15148.17s]  him what he doesn't drink he's coming in oil can i do anything oh it kind of does
[15153.50s -> 15179.86s]  man this oh yeah i try to ignite his alcohol breath maybe um i have this like sinking feeling
[15179.86s -> 15187.40s]  that i'm not supposed to be in this area i don't know how true that is i have a feeling i skipped
[15187.40s -> 15191.88s]  too much and i'm way over my head pretty sure because there was like two areas that i
[15192.60s -> 15208.39s]  i feel like i shouldn't be here right now i'm gonna give this one last try before going back
[15213.82s -> 15220.58s]  something about this just feels harder than it should feel at least in regards to like how many
[15220.58s -> 15236.01s]  enemies are here how many healing gourds i have i don't like to heal this is so many people here
[15236.01s -> 15239.29s]  it almost i don't feel like these people should even be here this place is burning what are you
[15239.29s -> 15255.80s]  doing here this this like ramped up to a thousand let me see if i can just clear this
[15272.28s -> 15274.06s]  i forget it every time
[15278.46s -> 15290.70s]  let me burn ah fuck this area uh no no no i'm fighting five six people at the same time
[15290.70s -> 15301.62s]  not right now i'm going to be on fucking zone no thanks uh where was it over here right
[15301.62s -> 15318.26s]  i'm gonna come back when i have like another attack power i was gonna bang my head against
[15318.26s -> 15327.86s]  the ceiling because i'm so damn tall all right there was a couple of places that was over here
[15327.86s -> 15333.62s]  right because i remember being like oh i got this and i went back and i that whole area was me
[15333.62s -> 15342.04s]  dropping the bell so this is where i was going progressing kind of normally through the game
[15364.97s -> 15372.23s]  oh okay i'm all right
[15376.54s -> 15392.79s]  oh funny and money you see this you hear about that i got only one pellet though like i can just
[15392.79s -> 15439.77s]  see me hello not broken your guard yet how is that possible i hear the loud sound take his health

[15466.06s -> 15476.70s]  chained ogre he's tied up to her grab attacks cannot be deflected there's no way to avoid
[15476.70s -> 15482.47s]  taking serious damage once grab enemy grab attacks can be evaded with a well-timed step
[15482.47s -> 15485.83s]  dodge even the strongest attacks are useless if they don't make contact
[15486.63s -> 15499.69s]  oh that was the exact same animation and energy as okay i'm gonna stop talking because i can't do
[15499.69s -> 15507.34s]  it and speak at the same time especially the blacksmith and dark souls one all right now i'll be
[15507.34s -> 15528.87s]  quiet i'm dead instantly this is insane insane what that's not a dodge that's not a time oh my you
[15528.87s -> 15547.29s]  got to be kidding me that's not dodge i don't think i even want to attempt to dodge that i'm

[15639.98s -> 15649.38s]  everybody should i just keep from i feel like i shouldn't be fucking resurrecting just to die again
[15650.34s -> 15675.69s]  wealth wrong button that's so quick i'm dead
[15691.85s -> 15698.89s]  he has like two different lunges he has a really like quick one that's the power bomb
[15698.89s -> 15711.24s]  and then he has a longer one which is the instant kill okay so let's try this again clear the trash
[15711.56s -> 15712.04s]  here
[15714.44s -> 15727.26s]  there's one more guy he's like up here can i get up there from over here
[15732.87s -> 15736.39s]  of course you can't fucking get it unless you start the encounter
[15741.61s -> 15750.71s]  don't get too overzealous here
[15758.09s -> 15811.75s]  grab again do it away don't believe me get this bolt motherfucker out of here no get greedy
[15816.12s -> 15841.91s]  for the burn again you gotta wait for the grab you gotta watch it elbow drop
[15853.64s -> 15871.91s]  i was just gonna drop it off the fucking ledge
[15879.10s -> 15886.70s]  why does he have elbow drops wwe ogre he's like the rock did they chain him up and like
[15886.70s -> 15892.78s]  fucking clockwork orange's eyes in front of like the attitude arrow all right got prayer beads a
[15892.78s -> 15912.34s]  loose prayer bead offering for them will increase okay two beads okay new medicine rank they wanted
[15912.34s -> 15919.53s]  to learn such techniques to be gravely injured time and time again by worthy opponents nice
[15921.29s -> 15927.96s]  i did it that was fun i didn't even have to complain that much about that fight
[15928.52s -> 15933.96s]  i did it was this guy up here that was the problem it was this guy the random guy standing up here
[15941.45s -> 15946.41s]  that was cool all right is that a boss or is it a how do i even know if it's a real boss
[15947.13s -> 15963.59s]  because we can go up there and nothing else right why does that just end up being a standard enemy
[15964.23s -> 15970.28s]  that would be so disheartening that's five community gifted subs from germa lied about
[15970.28s -> 15980.97s]  minecraft vr what a liar thank you uh nightjar monocular bamboo tube used to see distant objects
[15981.69s -> 15985.61s]  well shinobi already have good vision looking through this tube with one eye enables one to see
[15985.61s -> 15995.14s]  even further okay so this is the binoculars that no one ever uses i swear one day in one of these
[15995.70s -> 16001.93s]  from software games you know they oh wow i can't believe they're finding secrets in dark souls one
[16002.73s -> 16008.54s]  10 years later wow yeah that's interesting this is going to be something nobody puts the binoculars
[16008.54s -> 16013.90s]  on nobody uses them from software has probably something hidden in a skybox with the but you
[16013.90s -> 16021.91s]  can only see if you have the binoculars equipped the game like knows you have them on finally
[16021.91s -> 16026.15s]  another gourd seed i knew there was something going on in that last area like it was a secret
[16026.15s -> 16034.63s]  special little other area i had two flasks that place just felt way over my head and it was
[16040.34s -> 16061.29s]  anything else can't open that oh i see um uh this is like look uh i'm not doing this yet
[16069.34s -> 16082.90s]  i'm gonna like spend points and stuff hit 87 dollars i had like a thousand 20 minutes ago
[16086.06s -> 16098.30s]  uh do i have let me see three skill points maximum spirit emblems or three points i wonder if i
[16098.30s -> 16110.65s]  should hold off with this i wonder if i should wait one more point and get the better heal
[16113.93s -> 16116.42s]  or if i should do something else
[16136.30s -> 16142.68s]  i'm gonna have most of them eventually anyways but i think i'm gonna hold off for this one
[16143.24s -> 16186.52s]  i just don't know i just don't know maybe this uh uh this yeah i don't have any of these yet
[16186.52s -> 16202.90s]  counter thrust attacks by stomping down let me see do i need to put it on or is it just available now
[16203.54s -> 16218.46s]  i think it's just i just know it right passively right there's something about this game that makes
[16218.46s -> 16227.27s]  it distinctly more frustrating than other from soft games uh i think it's just not being used to
[16228.15s -> 16236.02s]  how the game is not supposed to play like dark souls it's the same engine it's the same inventory
[16236.02s -> 16242.87s]  slots the same ui technically right but you really are not supposed to play this like dark souls and
[16242.87s -> 16247.35s]  that is frustrating not because it's frustrating like oh i can't believe i want to play dark souls
[16247.35s -> 16252.74s]  4 but because you're just so used to playing all these games in such a fashion that
[16253.70s -> 16260.87s]  now you don't not anymore and your brain and your body kind of run into each other
[16266.12s -> 16275.72s]  but it's great i think it's great so far uh forget about these guys get me under
[16280.15s -> 16303.72s]  all right so oops that's the antagonist of the game uh cutscene no wait i'm not i have to fight
[16303.72s -> 16314.10s]  this guy this is the guy i fought in the first section is he just gonna all right um no it's
[16314.10s -> 16321.59s]  just it's just fight guy no this wait a minute people are shooting bows and arrows and shit
[16322.31s -> 16342.15s]  i'm not ready for this man he's got a lot of these things who's the other guy shooting
[16342.15s -> 16361.66s]  bow where is he where is he i didn't block that what how did you not block that
[16379.21s -> 16384.78s]  well now i know get everything i know there's no cutscenes that trigger why
[16387.42s -> 16391.02s]  all right you got a guy standing in a big open zone it's like okay like this is something's
[16391.02s -> 16402.26s]  gonna happen here nope aggro the whole time i gotta stop doing that because it's not a boss
[16403.54s -> 16405.86s]  i thought it was the guy from the beginning of the game
[16412.70s -> 16428.60s]  when you get in a situation like this you just die it's almost it's almost impossible to come
[16428.60s -> 16435.96s]  back from this with like five people chasing you might as well just die twice just do the title of
[16435.96s -> 16454.23s]  the game just bone out yeah like no reason especially considering that it's the game
[16454.23s -> 16467.96s]  pauses why wouldn't i just leave oh my god and we get to learn the hard way that
[16468.92s -> 16489.18s]  that takes almost twice as long as it does in dark souls okay good cool so we're gonna wrap around
[16492.04s -> 16508.36s]  wrap around and stealth kill a few people and then fight the guy in the middle just like this
[16508.92s -> 16551.38s]  where do they are what else do i got come here i just if you do that you're gonna
[16551.38s -> 16564.33s]  shatter every bone in your wrist you have to give me another arm um yeah can i
[16565.45s -> 16579.99s]  i just want to sneak around but that guy's is looking this uh nice stealth well this
[16580.95s -> 16587.56s]  and now here we go again hey play the fucking benny hill music here's 15
[16587.56s -> 16633.77s]  fucking people chasing you reset all right again so what's over here can i do something over this
[16633.77s -> 16641.14s]  way i feel like this guy's always taking a look to the left so i'm you just i can't even go that
[16641.14s -> 16686.55s]  way so let's try this way nope are they all connected to the same computer
[16699.11s -> 16706.58s]  yes they are actually yeah i mean i mean like but they communicate with this thing called son
[16707.38s -> 16723.24s]  well then you have to go to the left so the question is how do i get this guy to turn
[16723.24s -> 16729.98s]  fuck around because it's obvious it's obvious right that i have to go this way i can't go
[16729.98s -> 16734.30s]  over there everybody sees you and then the entire game aggro's to you so let's let's try this way
[16736.65s -> 16746.09s]  no guy walks guy walking this way right now he's ready to come over here um how do i pull this guy
[16746.09s -> 16766.38s]  without pulling the whole entire game it's got to be over here like this he doesn't walk all
[16766.38s -> 16772.98s]  the way up here does he what path is this he just comes to the very top of the stairs
[16776.38s -> 16779.10s]  don't tell me you just stand there you turn around eventually right thank you
[16791.58s -> 16800.07s]  that leaves this guy who i wonder okay let me just throw this out here does he not hear that
[16801.03s -> 16846.57s]  um i mean this i guess i just go get him everybody saw here we go but even the guy from down here
[16851.61s -> 16863.38s]  this guy with the frying pan maybe i should kill frying pan guy first
[16864.92s -> 16885.45s]  this is enough weeds to hide me probably not still get line of sight oh god what do i do
[16887.37s -> 16891.53s]  what um okay i'm gonna i'll take it i don't know where i am but i'll take it
[16892.55s -> 16902.46s]  that confetti again what was this turn back if you value your life you can't behead the headless
[16902.46s -> 16918.07s]  our swords and pikes did nothing so this is a new zone i'm not done with this one yet though
[16918.07s -> 16934.39s]  not yet as if i can go around there's an opportunity this is an opportunity to
[16934.39s -> 16947.35s]  catch this guy without anybody else maybe i think i can pull this guy and just be me and him i don't
[16947.35s -> 16968.47s]  see anybody else let's go here we go not far enough all right the question i had is
[16969.43s -> 17033.78s]  i got and he didn't see me first he's literally looking at me i don't oh my god oh that's a jump
[17033.78s -> 17092.02s]  that's a jump okay he does that slap he broke my guard easy no wow oh what oh why that was
[17092.02s -> 17135.14s]  like a quarter of a second move oh what was that oh i thought i was dead i just wow
[17136.10s -> 17158.95s]  oh holy shit now i gotta do all that dog shit again the whole courtyard with the guy the frying
[17158.95s -> 17179.05s]  pan i gotta kill that guy first he's frightening but he's gonna start playing the music the second
[17179.05s -> 17182.81s]  i step out here it's like gonna be like ready watch this i'm gonna stay i'm gonna go for frying
[17182.81s -> 17193.64s]  pan man first and then it's gonna go everyone's gonna be fighting me ready here we go it already
[17193.64s -> 17232.10s]  happened it's very much only go so far it only goes a short distance in front of you where is this
[17236.12s -> 17250.23s]  how did you even get there should i even ask
[17251.96s -> 17280.95s]  good game must be bullshit there he is let's go oh no no no no no no no no i want to fight
[17280.95s -> 17317.06s]  him alone not like with three people move and move is oh there's this like dickhead friend that
[17317.06s -> 17333.85s]  came running i have to get away from this it's not possible to fight two or three people at the same
[17333.85s -> 17356.18s]  time you gotta like a running hide or something i'm gonna go upgrade i have a seed no that's not
[17356.18s -> 17402.01s]  the right way it's this way let's create three heals undying samurai training oh uh i'm gonna
[17402.01s -> 17409.53s]  do that why are you guys talking shit about the vaude what's we why are you making fun of the vaude
[17410.17s -> 17421.80s]  you may use me to hone your staircase let's see how this works i should know we can perceive
[17421.80s -> 17424.52s]  incoming thrust attacks encounter them by stepping on the enemy blade
[17425.16s -> 17441.46s]  there's a powerful if risky move that deals more posture damage but how do you dodge in a direction
[17442.42s -> 17464.81s]  that's actually really good face me again it's a chat thing i wouldn't understand well that's good
[17464.81s -> 17471.14s]  to know so it's just a standard dog whatever you like if you have techniques thank you what about
[17471.14s -> 17490.39s]  in here anything unhip what do you mean unhip who's the lady oh no are they like dying here
[17490.39s -> 17497.34s]  together what are you doing hmm oh i didn't realize you were here the sculptor has been
[17497.34s -> 17504.55s]  coughing blood i took a sample of this blood for my dragon rod research a sample of his blood
[17504.55s -> 17510.47s]  yes blood that he's coughed up the color of the blood itself appears to be tainted
[17511.11s -> 17518.92s]  tainted blood but sculptor's blood alone isn't enough to reach any conclusion is there anything
[17518.92s -> 17526.12s]  i can do yes bring me samples of blood coughed up by others that suffer from the dragon rod
[17526.12s -> 17531.64s]  if i have more i'll be able to learn more about the disease if i come across anyone
[17531.64s -> 17548.20s]  afflicted by the dragon rod i'll ask them thank you three heels and i don't think i don't think
[17548.20s -> 17563.13s]  i have any more skills i can do right not at the moment no no well midair deflection or run and slide
[17568.18s -> 17605.38s]  i'll hold on to it quick give me some of your blood so i can use it so what about that door
[17606.02s -> 17631.18s]  can i just open the door hold on it's important uh where what was that where is that door i don't
[17631.18s -> 17644.20s]  even know what to do here i really don't it's gonna wait for this guy i want maybe i can stealth
[17644.20s -> 17677.22s]  kill that guy eventually i don't know i do appreciate the stealth kill but it i don't
[17677.22s -> 17702.66s]  like how loud it is if you i feel like everyone's hearing that the big like chime sound um okay those
[17702.66s -> 17710.97s]  two guys with shields or they just props i kind of i don't know what do you do when you have a
[17710.97s -> 17716.94s]  shield that big you just kind of sit on the ground and rest on it right well these guys be able to
[17716.94s -> 17742.04s]  see me this guy's freaking me out all right so there's that guy over there can i get on top
[17742.04s -> 17753.32s]  of the roof this is not that is a roof right there but what's the next step did everybody hear
[17753.32s -> 17769.93s]  that he's the guy with the pan he's gonna he's gonna start smacking the pan then everyone's
[17769.93s -> 17805.46s]  right here there's a big guy there he is he's a guy with a musket over here i had to let him do it
[17805.46s -> 17809.22s]  for a little while longer because that's the only thing he does he doesn't know how to do anything
[17809.22s -> 17814.97s]  else i mean i just wanted to make sure that he at least got some enjoyment of the last few seconds
[17815.53s -> 17833.14s]  okay i believe that's everybody where's big guy there he is now can i get the drop on him
[17834.10s -> 17843.62s]  with a stealth jump thing because he comes back to here right he's gonna come walk and he's gonna
[17843.62s -> 17856.55s]  turn around um i don't know if i can at least not from here i could try to just backstab him but
[17857.27s -> 17862.63s]  i feel like he's he'll probably hear me i'll try i'll give it a go i'll give it a go on this next
[17862.63s -> 17907.14s]  turn here just do that every time oh that sucked he's gonna get all of his posture back now
[17923.70s -> 17947.16s]  ah no don't do that shit oh my goodness gracious that's a new move i'm gonna die again
[17947.16s -> 17988.49s]  i had it going too i'm gonna kill him i think but it's gonna be real fucking messy well i have three
[17989.29s -> 18008.34s]  all it took was me uh making everybody sick again at least that guy's dead you know what this game
[18008.34s -> 18019.74s]  reminds me of metal gear rising it's like a more punishing version of metal gear rising in a way
[18019.74s -> 18028.31s]  that parry feels like metal gear rise it's like a slowed down version of trying to block with that
[18028.31s -> 18051.40s]  so all right so how do i cross this bridge doesn't look like i can grab it from here
[18052.62s -> 18063.08s]  uh well i think i found it what
[18066.31s -> 18093.78s]  no i'm gonna sneak attack you if i died by that lizard very embarrassing i need one more bead
[18095.14s -> 18110.04s]  i'm assuming memory is when you do those other areas oh that one hurt that one hurt okay
[18113.91s -> 18117.00s]  all right here you go you ready for the my impressions of the game first impressions
[18117.88s -> 18125.90s]  is hard as shit yeah i feel like the learning curve is way steeper than their previous games
[18127.30s -> 18137.82s]  but i feel like killing even basic enemies feels like you did something in the game i would say
[18138.46s -> 18153.24s]  it's definitely really really really good there is a sense of accomplishment for killing guy with
[18153.24s -> 18166.20s]  sword in his hand what is going on because yeah they can kill you just as easily what's that
[18166.20s -> 18194.31s]  earthquake is there gonna be an avalanche don't tell me there's an avalanche mid yeah i know how
[18194.31s -> 18204.15s]  to do that well not yet not yet wait wait wait wait wait wait there's probably something over here
[18204.79s -> 18230.46s]  there'll be something cool it just don't die don't die don't die don't die don't die good what it's
[18230.46s -> 18236.70s]  a turtle what is that it's a snake it's is it a turtle they's those turtles with the huge heads
[18236.78s -> 18255.35s]  remember those things oh god i know oh that's big that's a big snake do i have to fight this snake
[18262.86s -> 18270.46s]  uh okay it's like it's like mario no no no no no not like mario i i mean uh does the thing in
[18270.46s -> 18288.66s]  mario 64 we have to walk on it it's like it's a moving uh yes it's not gonna hurt me i have
[18288.66s -> 18304.97s]  to actually walk on this just like in mario here we go oh shit okay i'm alive did i miss something
[18304.97s -> 18320.30s]  i think i may have missed something maybe he's just here for fun i get to come back
[18321.10s -> 18337.38s]  his shadows died three times in my case uh but there's an item right there god damn it hold on
[18337.94s -> 18361.46s]  can i get back over here is he just in the cave i don't even know where i ended up where is he
[18362.18s -> 18380.76s]  oh i don't know where he is he's gonna make it down here i don't think he can this sucks
[18380.76s -> 18412.04s]  oh wait what okay so snake looks for you don't go near snake avoid snake died to pin snake
[18414.14s -> 18419.06s]  you guys are gonna be on that all night huh you guys gonna be on the pin snake thing
[18419.78s -> 18428.86s]  well now i can at least there's no items or anything so
[18429.42s -> 18438.18s]  i thought i could maybe just make the jump and not have to go here
[18438.98s -> 18453.05s]  all right that leaves this watch out snake just get across he can't go over that way
[18462.10s -> 18469.74s]  right now from in here i have to hide from the snake oh he's right here already though
[18469.74s -> 18497.24s]  where am i it's all misty and shit um is he's gonna do that again
[18499.08s -> 18509.85s]  fucking god damn it man god damn it no get why can i even go this way

[20413.82s -> 20426.86s]  shit oh yeah he did moves around so fast i i still am trying to wrap my brain around
[20427.50s -> 20434.68s]  when to resurrect and when not to resurrect don't tell me i'm doing this very wrong
[20461.90s -> 20479.08s]  just don't res unless you legit think you can kill him yeah let me try it again can i step on
[20479.08s -> 20499.56s]  the spear i don't think so i don't i don't get a prompt for it what's your name again

[20658.68s -> 20689.32s]  no i don't think so goodbye fuck off yeah shinobi execution memory
[20691.88s -> 20695.64s]  the battle memory of an extraordinary foe lingering in the mind of the wolf
[20697.72s -> 20701.80s]  commune with the sculptor's idol and confront memories of battle to permanently increase
[20701.80s -> 20712.74s]  attack power keeper of ashina castle gate mechanical barrel a mechanical metal barrel
[20712.74s -> 20718.31s]  that can be given to the sculptor to enable prosthetic tool upgrades it's perfectly inside
[20718.31s -> 20739.58s]  the wrist okay so after almost six hours of playing i started to realize that you don't
[20739.58s -> 20755.51s]  have to just parry every attack that's why i beat him there not really it helped it does help but
[20755.51s -> 20767.99s]  you don't have to i was under the impression that that was you had to do that it makes you look cool
[20767.99s -> 20782.39s]  yeah it does you can just block and then parry parry block swing swing block and you can dodge
[20782.39s -> 20788.65s]  it i'm i was trying to go a little too fast with it in regards to perfect parry perfect
[20788.65s -> 20799.58s]  parry perfect parry swing swing swing swing you don't have to do that okay so i have
[20800.22s -> 20816.70s]  prosthetic tool upgrades yeah yeah yeah upgraded tools can be created now i should okay that's
[20816.70s -> 20842.07s]  another level up cool is there anything else here that i can do i think i'm good here unless
[20842.07s -> 20868.55s]  i can get up there which i don't think i can wait what's in there might as well the enhance
[20868.55s -> 20873.19s]  attack power option has been unlocked you can now consume battle memories to increase your attack
[20873.19s -> 20879.85s]  power causing you to deal more vitality and posture damage with your attacks but wait a minute
[20881.77s -> 20906.34s]  should can i put this in the buddha and should i not use this yet let me see what is it attack
[20906.34s -> 20916.84s]  power one let's just do it battle memory of an extraordinary foe although distant
[20917.40s -> 20923.78s]  recollection of such a memory provided sustenance for the wolf onewa once led a group of infamous
[20923.78s -> 20929.14s]  bandits but was defeated by ishin who was so captivated by his show of strength that he took
[20929.14s -> 20936.58s]  him in as an ashini warrior onewa would later go on to become gen nichi row ashina's most trusted
[20936.58s -> 20953.05s]  retainer attack power has been enhanced yeah why is that memory one out of one weirdly enough okay
[20953.77s -> 20973.37s]  let me go back to the temple give this upgraded thing so you can't hold on to more than one
[20980.26s -> 20987.93s]  it's a mechanism that can serve as the very core of the prosthetic
[20988.01s -> 20994.89s]  pendant here fit it to the arm what difference does the barrel make with a versatile base such
[20994.89s -> 21004.26s]  as this i can use various purifying agents to further all agents purifying agents of materials
[21006.10s -> 21020.70s]  gunpowder scrap metal things like gunpowder and scrap do have a lot of those things i don't have
[21020.70s -> 21034.02s]  any more tools do i no but i do have upgrade materials and sen can be spent to create upgraded
[21034.02s -> 21040.79s]  versions of tools you must own the base tool and also complete any prerequisite upgrades
[21043.11s -> 21060.02s]  okay so we've got unknown tool look at this spring loaded axe unknown shuriken it's like
[21060.02s -> 21082.74s]  monster hunter spring load flame vent i can't do any of these yet very cool okay that i already did
[21090.54s -> 21107.83s]  so now now i'm gonna try to go back and do fat guy i have no money unless there's some hold on
[21107.83s -> 21125.42s]  let me see the castle gate is there something else i missed here yeah it didn't open this door
[21126.14s -> 21138.18s]  why is sub only on uh people are kind of going crazy in the first like hour or two of the stream
[21139.06s -> 21145.05s]  so i figured maybe we should chill it out for a little while so we're just gonna keep going
[21145.05s -> 21178.07s]  progress oh right give me the days i wish sub only mode was on all the time things are
[21178.07s -> 21184.15s]  chilling i could read messages um i mean it has i think it has a time and like a place for it
[21185.19s -> 21202.60s]  something like this is not really uh brand new from software game i think you know warrants
[21202.68s -> 21206.62s]  maybe it being on for the sake of you know somebody's
[21207.34s -> 21215.10s]  vaccinating like crazy or saying spoilers or stuff like that you know it's kind of it's by
[21215.10s -> 21239.66s]  design right all right let's get let me see i guess we're gonna go this way spoilers anything
[21239.66s -> 21258.95s]  else up here i want to get over there uh can i nope that's just not gonna happen is it
[21259.67s -> 21281.18s]  i'm gonna have to go on the roof from here that's more like it more attack power candy can only hold
[21281.18s -> 21313.78s]  so much of it what really i mean i think i jumped into it i that's not fair i just got kaizo blocked
[21313.78s -> 21319.90s]  well i'm kind of being sloppy now yeah look at how look at how just sloppy i'm being i used
[21320.94s -> 21327.02s]  five thousand percent of my brain power on that last boss i'm dead i i'm just gonna die i don't
[21327.02s -> 21365.48s]  want to use the resurrect okay let's try this again so let's take a look at this before i just

[21458.58s -> 21482.01s]  i can't even tell when they're attacking really just die again uh it's possible we're getting
[21482.01s -> 21501.77s]  close to gamer fatigue it's very possible yeah when you make mistakes like that like literally i
[21502.49s -> 21509.22s]  it's like a cinder block in my brain right now let me go back here for a second
[21509.78s -> 21521.83s]  okay that was a car on top of another car there's no way that wasn't just a triple decker car and

[22386.52s -> 22402.39s]  there's one here he's facing this direction there's one that's the point of emote
[22403.83s -> 22419.35s]  yes i know black gunpowder good get off me get off me get off me
[22423.29s -> 22425.21s]  is it weird that i want somebody to do that to me
[22427.13s -> 22444.02s]  it's like looney tunes he broke every bone in my back all right how many more
[22444.02s -> 22459.78s]  is there another one did it say how many there were last seen around the castle gate
[22463.19s -> 22495.05s]  oops i think that's it unless it's somewhat here which i don't see there's only three i think
[22495.05s -> 22515.22s]  let's see what he says is this guy just gonna give me kill quests imagine finding out your
[22515.22s -> 22520.18s]  neighbor is not only a streamer but is obsessed with you and has an emote dedicated to you because
[22520.18s -> 22549.26s]  you drive loud apart from my arm machinist style skills it's a whole nother treat
[22554.78s -> 22563.51s]  it's our school of fighting no hard and fast movie just win your battles that alone is the
[22563.51s -> 22570.94s]  most important rule of the ashen style i hope it can be of assistance with your rat hunt and most
[22570.94s -> 22581.29s]  of all your own battles you get to fight about the ways of the ashina yeah it's our school of
[22581.29s -> 22587.54s]  fighting you just win your just win that alone somebody mentioned this was chat earlier
[22589.13s -> 22594.04s]  they're uh they were completely correct they were absolutely right okay here's uh
[22596.65s -> 22617.29s]  ashina i guess i have to be sitting down it's not a big deal you just win well okay
[22619.06s -> 22642.97s]  i wonder if i'm good enough to attempt fat guy again i'm gonna try ashina delivers a heavy one
[22642.97s -> 22649.77s]  hit overhead strike high posture damage and also recovers one's own posture with a strong forward
[22649.77s -> 22660.15s]  step single-minded mastery is the heart of the ashina style strength so just one big huge heavy
[22660.15s -> 22683.54s]  swing i gotta pick something and stick with it uh well here's your replayability that people
[22683.54s -> 22689.94s]  were concerned about i don't know if you can get all these maybe you can only do one of these trees
[22689.94s -> 22703.45s]  and maybe some of the other ones i don't know but this to me looks like replayability but
[22704.01s -> 22724.62s]  i'm going to end of the stream no no i'm trying to decide on what i want to do with my points
[22725.42s -> 22733.24s]  should i try this should i just do this all the way okay there's a slash and then there's a power
[22733.24s -> 22756.26s]  up power up there's all power ups this is the parry do something and but i got i'm gonna take
[22756.26s -> 22760.98s]  my time i want to make sure it's what i want to do i'm not just gonna go as fast as i can or hurry
[22760.98s -> 22772.50s]  up so when you just deflect it increases damage done to their posture from all sources that's
[22772.50s -> 22785.21s]  great so this is this is deflect every move let's put this up and see what it looks like
[22785.93s -> 22810.57s]  that takes a while ha ha wow that's it's gonna be hard to do it's worth a shot let's go try to
[22810.57s -> 22822.42s]  fight the the drunk guy i'm gonna be slow i'm gonna clear it out this is where we want to be
[22828.71s -> 22837.94s]  after this i'm probably gonna take a break and we're gonna start tomorrow probably early again
[22837.94s -> 22849.82s]  tomorrow i've leveled up twice well at once technically right let's just see if i can do
[22849.82s -> 22865.72s]  this shit does this go oh right okay and then i'm not going let me let me let me uh work backwards
[22880.76s -> 22884.28s]  and i say that because i want to fight the wizard he's the real boss of the night for me
[22884.84s -> 22930.49s]  i can't really tell what that was but no matter the boss was the friends we made along the way
[22931.05s -> 22963.56s]  i mean yeah okay clear now where was the wizard asshole so there was a way to go down
[22964.20s -> 22973.42s]  i panicked around here and i just started sprinting in random directions there's a
[22973.42s -> 22991.03s]  cave that was the cave i just came down though where is that guy here okay it was down here
[22992.26s -> 23019.54s]  all right let's go me versus the wizard i'm ready fuck i was waiting okay so that was a sweep
[23040.04s -> 23059.96s]  is there more than one wizard yeah there is it's a bunch of them they're just a regular enemy what
[23059.96s -> 23067.93s]  didn't block it no i blocked it fuck you what you got you can't block thrusts
[23080.82s -> 23093.00s]  no so many mechanics that need to memorize fuck dodge parry jump rock paper scissor
[23094.17s -> 23118.87s]  i have to go down there i don't know where the fuck i am right now i killed the first spear guy
[23126.15s -> 23130.39s]  now i have to do all this shit you know what i don't care i'm just gonna run by these fucking
[23130.39s -> 23136.57s]  people i'm just gonna run by the first wizard i want i'm supposed to see what's down here
[23137.13s -> 23157.50s]  i don't want to fight 10 15 people what's even down here that really just happened get it get it
[23157.50s -> 23203.03s]  get it get it okay that's it i got it i did it no oh my god just the the back and forth with the
[23203.03s -> 23209.19s]  fucking the dash the fucking it's just you have to just fucking muscle memory memorize it and it
[23209.19s -> 23231.42s]  takes a long time no that's wrong but i'm still gonna kill him like i had a ton of money on him
[23231.98s -> 23243.96s]  thank god i did this just my brain has trouble when that little indicator pops up it's almost
[23243.96s -> 23247.08s]  like i meant it's it's like playing batman right you're waiting for that to happen
[23247.64s -> 23252.60s]  but also on top of waiting for that to happen you need to like play the game too because think
[23252.60s -> 23259.82s]  about when batman you can just wait for that to pop up and just press y and be fine and be done
[23259.82s -> 23265.26s]  you gotta like be aware of everything going on and wait for the batman signal and it's one of three
[23265.26s -> 23275.22s]  different batman potential counters this game really makes you feel like batman i'm dead here
[23275.22s -> 23307.16s]  i got a bone out of here just don't let this guy kill me in the bone up it's a slow guy he's gonna
[23307.16s -> 23315.62s]  end it he's gonna end it isn't he isn't he no he's not don't do i don't have any pellets
[23317.69s -> 23332.90s]  no we don't throw that just distracted him all right bone out oh shit he's gonna end the stream
[23339.51s -> 23367.66s]  okay i'm not done yet all the way to the bottom okay okay
[23375.61s -> 23388.15s]  that leaves me with there's two ways for me to go right now i want to try i want to try to do
[23388.15s -> 23399.85s]  the drunk guy just once and then i'm going to rage turn off the stream don't ask me why i
[23399.85s -> 23420.07s]  boned all the way out here i'm dying of dragon rod yeah i know very very appropriate thing to
[23420.07s -> 23429.06s]  be suffering from right now right all right let's do this let's just go through wait a minute wait
[23429.06s -> 23438.82s]  wait wait wait don't i have a seed didn't i buy a seed did i already use it i did i use that seed
[23438.82s -> 23461.61s]  that i bought i don't remember using it maybe i did you piece of crap you piece of crap seriously
[23461.61s -> 23492.76s]  i didn't use it did i wouldn't it be in my inventory no i gotta go use this and should i
[23492.76s -> 23510.90s]  heal everybody's rod or should i wait till they're just barely dead and then resurrect the houses on
[23510.90s -> 23533.27s]  fire well let's heal is this healing them no that's the wrong thing what do i i gotta give to the
[23533.27s -> 23545.83s]  his buddha wrong thing you do actually do it at the bonfire oh i thought it said like he had
[23545.91s -> 23574.71s]  used it at his like buddha thing did he just he just didn't use it hopefully this is not a mistake
[23584.22s -> 23589.10s]  offer okay restore the power of light to those who have been drained of it by offering this drop to
[23589.10s -> 23601.93s]  the sculptor's idol with the recovery charm in hand still don't understand it appears as though
[23601.93s -> 23611.74s]  your body come and see me i will so i need i need the recovery charm all right these are all things
[23611.74s -> 23630.02s]  to consider for tomorrow but i want to just try to fight this guy and give one solid attempt
[23638.71s -> 23644.06s]  then i've got to go i'm gonna cry i'm gonna get some food i wanted to go a little bit longer
[23644.06s -> 23655.64s]  because i still want to play but of course of course i get cursed with getting sick the day
[23656.36s -> 23661.00s]  before one of the biggest releases of the year and not only that one of the most anticipated
[23661.00s -> 23668.25s]  releases for me that i wanted to play i just slid on that just stop being sick i wish it were
[23668.25s -> 23685.48s]  that easy this part like my goodness because ever you have to get rid of these guys otherwise they'll

[23699.82s -> 23709.80s]  across the whole lake we've done it like three times it happens every time can you stealth not
[23709.80s -> 23725.93s]  here it's a big open field you can run past them well every time i run past them they just run
[23725.93s -> 23734.52s]  across the lake and i get hit by they like four or five people come from behind it's happened the
[23734.52s -> 23753.62s]  last three times we tried it yeah i on the roof you can run by them on the roof but there's always
[23753.62s -> 23778.62s]  a few that aggro i'm just gonna kill them all and i want no variables maybe through the building
[23778.62s -> 23790.46s]  here to the right maybe you can walk through the building like on top and then around okay
[23791.02s -> 23804.44s]  uh i have two heels there shouldn't be anybody left let's go try to do this i'm gonna really
[23804.44s -> 23815.78s]  seriously attempt it let's go talk to this guy maybe should i can i pull these guys first i wonder

[24058.94s -> 24075.82s]  so close the double i tried to dodge the double tap oh no i have to do all this bullshit again
[24079.62s -> 24086.79s]  slapping ass cheeks and anger god i've never concentrated more in a game than like that
[24089.50s -> 24101.19s]  i had it too so close it's definitely doable but fuck man that was i was like two hits away
[24102.39s -> 24108.33s]  just that string is so strange it's like champion gundyr that's what it reminds me of
[24109.13s -> 24133.78s]  when champion gundyr does that little like pain in the ass all right come on and see what i mean
[24133.78s -> 24144.22s]  though that that motherfucker right there is not gonna stop that guy is he's gonna bow he's gonna

[24293.75s -> 24325.69s]  just kill me i'm gonna kill this guy before it's through the stream it's gonna happen i know it is
[24325.69s -> 24336.79s]  it doesn't mean it's not frustrating as hell trying to kill this guy i'm gonna do it it's
[24336.79s -> 24354.79s]  gonna happen eventually i know it okay if i go up there without him then i aggro everybody
[24354.79s -> 24370.26s]  especially even the drunk guy so i have to take him with me you got to this part in two hours
[24370.98s -> 24391.08s]  well so did i but i went and did two other bosses and came back here i think it's time i don't even
[24391.08s -> 24410.23s]  care i'm going for it i'm using these things so this is attack power i feel like i'm just gonna
[24410.23s -> 24441.35s]  use this like right now go hey you really i got this dumb aggro right now actually probably for
[24441.35s -> 24469.66s]  the best is he should i don't think he'll die to these guys really he might all right easy i don't
[24469.66s -> 24491.46s]  know why i did that but i decided to do it for some reason he's gonna die here i don't know
[24491.46s -> 24534.82s]  anymore even killed him thought he was done not enough go drink get it get it oh my god there's
[24534.82s -> 24571.98s]  so much breaking up my posture oh it hurts back up back up back up back up no not the palm

[24641.54s -> 24661.08s]  for getting one too drunk too quick okay yes oh that was rough and that's just like the third
[24661.08s -> 24669.82s]  mini boss there's been one real boss and then two or three mini bosses and man they're pretty rough

[25609.61s -> 25628.10s]  it's a sweep that's a sweep he's a sweeper i think a side dodge is better than uh he baseball swung
[25628.10s -> 25644.44s]  up my lord that's heavy he caught me in the air i was actually pretty good on his part
[25645.16s -> 25676.71s]  yeah i don't think i should try to parry that just dodge forehead guys with the bows are really

[25806.92s -> 25816.82s]  the hidden temple in the errata estate given by the owl you inconsiderate fuck
[25818.44s -> 25837.70s]  uh hold on this one's been building for a while the very back of the estate i know where it is
[25837.70s -> 25841.54s]  too the lord is absolute defended with your life if he is taken bring him back at any cost
[25848.41s -> 25856.87s]  no one ever told me to not put utensils in the microwave i was trying to heat him up to make it
[25856.87s -> 25900.41s]  so when i ate my soup it was nice and warm i'm not laughing at that wait why did the fire get worse
[25901.59s -> 25917.21s]  uh somebody talked about do how they do that without the ice cream you use you put you warm
[25917.21s -> 25923.05s]  up your utensils so you can eat ice cream easier it's like that's genius but what the fuck
[25924.33s -> 25931.50s]  so you what you put warm water like under the sink i've never even thought about that sometimes
[25931.50s -> 25936.86s]  i let the ice cream just sit on the counter for like three hours because it's too cold to eat
[25937.66s -> 25945.80s]  and i never thought for a second just to take a spoon and like put hot water on it well you
[25945.80s -> 25952.04s]  just chisel out and eat little ice cream chips and then you get sick of it you throw it that hurts
[25954.28s -> 25969.26s]  where do i need to go sneak i'm just boning out of here get to my left and follow the cliff
[25969.90s -> 25989.54s]  who's left my left or your left there might be an item or two that i missed
[25989.54s -> 26001.48s]  from here might as well just do it yeah it's possible jump down there because we're gonna
[26001.48s -> 26010.44s]  miss like the weird jumping from like monopoly house to monopoly house right that's cool that's
[26010.44s -> 26032.74s]  cool yeah ah that's cool all right here we are uh i can bone out of here just want to see if there's
[26032.74s -> 26046.23s]  anything that i missed on the left when did i stop taking the stream seriously i'm i'm still taking
[26046.23s -> 26064.42s]  it seriously all right here we go it's gonna is there anything i can i have nine hundred and
[26064.42s -> 26072.22s]  sixty four dollars i think i'm gonna where's the guy that i can buy stuff from somewhere in here
[26072.22s -> 26082.42s]  right no where are they you're like up here i got money and if this is a major boss that i'm going
[26082.42s -> 26098.84s]  to lose to over and over again i might as well use this money okay so is it up this way i know
[26098.92s -> 26122.36s]  there was a couple of npcs if here no this is progressing further what about this way maybe
[26125.45s -> 26146.68s]  possibly because this goes up into the rat guy and then over here yeah hi i do want to purchase
[26146.68s -> 26158.65s]  something yes i do i'm gonna get the firecrackers it's just another thing to try uh maybe i should
[26158.65s -> 26166.50s]  just buy a bunch of this stuff why would you purchase a coin i guess maybe just um yeah you
[26166.50s -> 26177.66s]  know what let's do it let's do it because i understand why you do that it's to store the
[26177.66s -> 26187.72s]  money so you don't lose it that makes sense what else would you use a coin pouch for in case you
[26187.72s -> 26239.00s]  die yeah that's cool interesting way to do it okay i'm ready god i just love video games okay take
[26239.00s -> 26268.87s]  those seeds use the key what's behind door number one oh boy that's a cutscene
[26301.94s -> 26338.84s]  is the real magician yes it looks like an actual wizard battle yeah good luck good luck you look
[26338.84s -> 26349.64s]  like a shoe i was gonna untie you and you'll be done uh vitality and posture yeah the lower
[26349.64s -> 26354.44s]  one's vitality the slower their posture recovers that's right posture gauges color gets redder as
[26354.44s -> 26362.46s]  recovery rate slows fast posture recovery ideally you gotta bring i gotta bring your health down
[26366.22s -> 26396.36s]  okay why lady butterfly why ah i don't know what that move does i'm assuming it's when she does
[26396.36s -> 26416.02s]  that like big dun dun like that well was that a grab i can't even tell i'm dead game over uh i
[26417.51s -> 26435.54s]  i'm not gonna resurrect until i have a better idea what the hell's going on no reason not to
[26435.54s -> 26454.84s]  well it's on a timer right it's not i thought when you what what about the pie she's just waiting
[26454.84s -> 26461.30s]  for me listen so that once she goes in the air it's a grab so you just have to dodge it
[26462.42s -> 26493.48s]  what is that is that does that count as a thrust dear god i have no idea damn it's hard to really
[26493.48s -> 26569.88s]  get around okay not bad back it up yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah die get out of my way
[26569.88s -> 26577.72s]  wait a minute the snap peas snap see snap peas should i even do this should i another attempt
[26577.72s -> 26591.29s]  so wait ah she's oh no but i don't have i need more healing i don't want to use one of these
[26591.29s -> 26600.97s]  items i know snap peas now but where i only have six of them where am i what do i get more of them
[26601.53s -> 26614.34s]  you know i'm saying i'm not gonna use them until i have a good attempt
[26633.18s -> 26642.66s]  why i have no reason not to respond i feel like this ain't gonna help me here
[26646.42s -> 26660.94s]  you can revive once the second one is on the timer okay i see start again i'm not gonna use the
[26660.94s -> 26696.68s]  those pellets either let's try let's go i'm hold on i'm all tangled up here really that sucks
[26696.68s -> 26735.70s]  that's a waste of an attempt right here get out of the way i'm out of posture eat this
[26735.70s -> 26746.15s]  that's actually not a bad move to do that it's so hard to avoid that fucking move you gotta wait
[26746.15s -> 26767.90s]  till the last possible millisecond kind of like spend some money to make that guy never come back
[26768.62s -> 26780.57s]  thankfully this is right here all right let's see you think i'm gonna die 200 times
[26781.29s -> 26805.50s]  no i think that's the first time i've seen that move what the fuck man oh my god give me even like
[26806.30s -> 26844.55s]  a second oh even one second one fucking second i didn't even get a chance i'll give you point
[26844.55s -> 26849.27s]  five seconds i'm gonna get i i'm gonna give us a few attempts somebody else is like dying from
[26849.27s -> 26880.65s]  fucking cough rot speak of which there it is this boss is really easy just make sure you don't get
[26880.65s -> 26913.69s]  hit and hit her if i can jump down all right easy ease it ease that's a that's a sweep
[26914.33s -> 26947.08s]  it was a sweep it's hell it goes on my healing she's already like backed up started out all
[26947.08s -> 26967.78s]  right and then uh you know what i think i'm gonna do i think i'm just gonna instead of healing just
[26967.78s -> 26992.74s]  die and then use all the heels she just blocked it really well i mean not heal at all go as long
[26992.74s -> 27043.38s]  as i can and die and then use my heels she's just very unpredictable that didn't come on now don't
[27043.38s -> 27093.11s]  do this to me breaking my rule it's a sweep on the ground pretty much every time gotcha don't let you
[27093.11s -> 27139.02s]  recover okay phase two let's just use them i'm gonna see what it does oh just eliminates them
[27139.50s -> 27158.79s]  okay i know it doesn't i what does that do that's kind of okay is that a sweep i can't tell
[27160.18s -> 27186.92s]  of course this asshole it's always a sweep on the ground it seems dude these little magical
[27186.92s -> 27251.82s]  fucking orbs watch out for those magics no god damn it that move oh fuck that move
[27255.32s -> 27277.51s]  that move sucks such ass oh fuck off what a load of dog shit perfect fucking dodges with like
[27277.51s -> 27324.63s]  no iframes oh fuck off each shit that's bullshit okay what the fuck give me a fucking break
[27324.63s -> 27349.27s]  no i didn't throw my controller i put it on the table slightly angrily i'm stuck on the
[27349.27s -> 27370.30s]  all right bites controller in half that was definitely the attempt to probably do it and
[27370.94s -> 27380.23s]  is it three phases i wouldn't be surprised you know it's like funny about these games especially
[27380.23s -> 27386.31s]  this game especially about squirrel i you know i probably could it's probably easier to win the
[27386.31s -> 27399.66s]  lottery than it is to beat these bosses you know what i mean i bet you okay in the time it takes
[27399.66s -> 27404.14s]  for me to beat this boss i could probably buy like a scratch ticket every like 20 minutes
[27405.70s -> 27425.53s]  and like win 50 bucks all right this is a dead run let me start over
[27443.64s -> 27449.30s]  every death is an hour of minecraft no i really i you know what i really need to do i really do
[27449.30s -> 27455.51s]  need to get out of here because if anybody knows anything about muscle memory and playing games
[27455.51s -> 27462.42s]  like this you gotta have like 24 hours for your brain to even know what it's doing see i haven't
[27462.42s -> 27468.18s]  like saved my game in my brain yet everything i've learned so far is not here until i do until i go
[27468.18s -> 27526.84s]  to sleep in skyrim no it's a sweep you have to get more uh no i wasn't close enough
[27528.73s -> 27540.49s]  are you almost at the health pool or i can actually hurt you i thought it was another dash
[27541.69s -> 27564.50s]  i thought it was gonna be a spin oh i can't get out i'm stuck oh my fucking god guys i can't move
[27564.50s -> 27571.59s]  like if i fell in my well it's in my house i don't know i don't know somebody is a rope
[27571.59s -> 27577.19s]  because i fell all the way down i pee into this fucking thing just throw the rope down here i'm
[27577.19s -> 27609.02s]  trying to climb out it's only like it's only like 60 feet i have to i'm gonna take a break

[27679.45s -> 27685.18s]  this this is so difficult for me to do right now if you if you walked in here with like gasoline
[27685.18s -> 27690.14s]  right and you were like jeremy uh you better hurry up and beat this the whole house is gonna burn
[27692.55s -> 27713.83s]  you can just walk around and like i didn't know where i was going with that one
[27714.55s -> 27722.47s]  this is pure insanity what i was trying to say was in the time it took for somebody to like pour
[27722.55s -> 27729.86s]  gasoline all over my house give me 10 warnings and then start it in the corner i'd still be here
[27729.86s -> 27741.32s]  like in fucking an hour and a half not even that you could just make you could make like a small
[27741.32s -> 27748.46s]  little like wood tp downstairs and sit there and blow on it while i'm up here screaming
[27749.42s -> 27774.90s]  you can steal everything in the house uh this is actually the last time that i'm gonna get out of

[28151.26s -> 28157.99s]  really do that is when they go in the air they throw the thing wait how long has this been on
[28157.99s -> 28165.13s]  for how long has that been on for did you not see that attempt how what is the last thing you saw
[28168.06s -> 28178.38s]  no fucking way okay just okay good i was gonna say that was a really good attempt
[28179.02s -> 28189.85s]  oh this game is so hard it's like next level now i see what people are talking about
[28190.57s -> 28195.88s]  i was like no it's not like what do you mean it's like the hardest game that they've ever made
[28196.60s -> 28204.23s]  everybody says that no this is fucking brutal it's it's fun though because it just fucking
[28204.23s -> 28269.98s]  it's something i i might have to restart again that was a good exchange you just fucking embarrassed
[28269.98s -> 28301.19s]  me on my stream the only person that embarrasses me on my stream is me come here come here come here
[28301.19s -> 28379.13s]  group up group up group up not this time not this time elsa oh and we can finally call it quits
[28391.32s -> 28402.42s]  fucking frozen shoe bitch do i it's too hard please don't burn my house down with gasoline
[28402.42s -> 28424.79s]  that was really fun okay droplet pale pink crystal residue known to form when an immortal
[28424.79s -> 28431.75s]  oath fails to step okay i'm gonna talk about this for a second those you've that you guys
[28431.75s -> 28437.67s]  that have seen the cinematic masterpiece and written down book masterpiece that is
[28438.31s -> 28445.82s]  the harry potter universe okay you know that scene when dumbledore the most the strongest
[28445.82s -> 28451.34s]  character in the entire universe right he drinks that he tells harry to do it he's gonna drink
[28451.34s -> 28458.76s]  that potion and he's like i can't i can't do it please no please i know no the strongest guy in
[28458.76s -> 28469.05s]  the whole world and he says let make sure that i do the whole thing right it's really hard and
[28469.05s -> 28473.29s]  he tells her like throughout the course and he's like i'm not doing it i'm not doing it i'm getting
[28473.29s -> 28485.10s]  it away from me but they do it and then spoiler alert i was gonna say that something else but
[28492.02s -> 28496.90s]  point is i was saying those things i was going no i can't do it i'm not gonna do it i'm done
[28496.90s -> 28502.92s]  i'm going home but all i just had to drink the rest of the potion and i'm now i'm fine
[28510.58s -> 28517.22s]  it's too much for me no it's too hard i gotta go i'm leaving how is that a bad analogy
[28517.22s -> 28535.59s]  dumbledore drinks the potion and he says he can and you took your hands off the
[28535.59s -> 28553.78s]  controller and this is what happens died to cutscene wheel okay
[28584.49s -> 28590.09s]  the potion actually like was the potion was killing dumbledore
[28591.34s -> 28608.78s]  no he was fine look i just missed him i just missed a major major storyline cutscene because
[28608.78s -> 28616.18s]  somebody questioned my dumbledore analogy i'm furious right now i am fucking furious what
[28616.18s -> 28647.11s]  just happened nothing here put this in firecracker blinds foes and inflicts posture damage on beast
[28647.11s -> 28654.01s]  type 70s i can't even it's time to go that is such a perfect opportunity for me to tell you that's
[28654.01s -> 28666.60s]  i'll see you tomorrow that wouldn't even words that was just phonetically pronouncing sounds
[28666.60s -> 28679.10s]  where i thought the spaces needed to be for the text that was on the screen all right so what do
[28679.10s -> 28684.01s]  you think about sakiro where would you put it in the oh we're gonna call it something different
[28684.01s -> 28702.92s]  now the the sakiro is born the the the the the the souls the souls kiro born games i don't know
[28702.92s -> 28712.17s]  it's really hard to say i i do think it is probably so first time playthrough i think is
[28712.17s -> 28721.14s]  the hardest i'm trying to remember dark souls 3 dark souls 1 bloodborne try remember the first
[28721.14s -> 28725.75s]  10 hours or so in the game i think it's the hardest first 10 hours of any of the games
[28727.86s -> 28731.78s]  now that who knows if that's going to keep being the case whether or not you know when i have my
[28731.78s -> 28738.30s]  save point when i wake up tomorrow my muscle memory and all that it it's fantastic though
[28738.54s -> 28752.60s]  it's everything and more that snake was just 10 out of 10 it's great to get your ass kicked by
[28752.60s -> 28761.42s]  a game that's really really hard but i'm gonna that's just exactly at eight hours here i will
[28761.42s -> 28777.40s]  see you i'm not even gonna move from this spot well i am but the character is not so tomorrow
[28777.40s -> 28782.55s]  uh i'm just gonna whenever i get up and get going we're gonna go again i'm not gonna play
[28782.55s -> 28789.13s]  without what are you talking about when have i ever done a from software game on stream
[28789.77s -> 28802.15s]  and didn't finish it no wait i'm gonna try to get through the whole thing dark souls 2 i didn't
[28802.15s -> 28809.37s]  know but dark souls 2 was i already beat dark souls 2 twice before that stream even started
[28809.37s -> 28813.99s]  demon souls i beat all the demon souls on stream all dark souls 1 all dark souls 3
[28813.99s -> 28824.36s]  we have no evidence of that i can show you steam achievements that would count long story short
[28824.36s -> 28834.41s]  i'm gonna give this a yes out of all right my final rating will have to come later
[28843.37s -> 28847.45s]  definitely two thumbs up if you are on the fence oh i'm not so sure they went a different direction
[28847.45s -> 28857.43s]  it's great if you like smashing your face against a wall over and over again and eventually putting
[28857.43s -> 28862.87s]  on both pants and tightening up your belt i'm achieving great victory in a hard video game
[28862.87s -> 28874.36s]  absolutely it's fantastic so uh let's actually put on the outro screen hopefully by tomorrow
[28874.36s -> 28878.44s]  this cough will be gone or at least diminished to a point where you won't even know what's happening
[28878.84s -> 28887.34s]  okay and we are going to go back to the bits i'm actually going to pee though first because it looks
[28887.34s -> 28893.69s]  like we got probably like about 30 30 40 minutes of bits shouldn't take us too long but i will be
[28893.69s -> 29027.54s]  right back i'm just gonna pee see you guys in a second oh i thought i muted me passing stones

[30109.56s -> 30112.68s]  you can find somebody to hang out there somebody that can
[30117.40s -> 30130.62s]  chill with you we should make it called i don't think that's a good idea it's a very bad idea
[30133.46s -> 30137.38s]  but take care of yourself i wish you the best thank you so much for the 250
[30140.92s -> 30149.64s]  like-minded indeed we all eat an equal amount of glue now i eat way more i eat the most

[30157.93s -> 30163.05s]  of an eternity where the only thing you can perceive is germa defoe in front of you you
[30163.05s -> 30168.49s]  cannot hear smell feel or taste anything just stare at germa defoe eternally with no perception
[30168.49s -> 30177.86s]  of anything else i don't think it matters what image it is any image would be terrible that could
[30177.86s -> 30185.93s]  be it could be a a puppy and after 200 millennia you'd be like get this fucking dog out of my face
[30187.69s -> 30191.53s]  it would start to morph you ever look in a mirror for long enough at yourself
[30192.57s -> 30197.45s]  if you just stare at yourself in a mirror for five minutes your eyes and your like teeth start to
[30197.45s -> 30206.25s]  morph imagine looking at yourself in a mirror 60 years straight thousand years straight don't
[30206.25s -> 30227.72s]  ever do that during a dream though are you high no just sick honey chain thanks with three bucks

[30231.96s -> 30241.03s]  we said super seal 250 i can see why you wouldn't want to but don't be afraid to turn on sub only
[30241.03s -> 30254.17s]  mode more often i like how chill it is more than the others yeah it i think it works sometimes
[30256.42s -> 30262.10s]  but i like having chat go crazy sometimes i like having chat react instantly and be able to look
[30262.10s -> 30273.72s]  over there and see something instantly from everybody right sub only mode all the time is
[30273.80s -> 30284.60s]  it's like paying to chat right and sometimes when there's i guess more than two three four five
[30284.60s -> 30289.96s]  thousand people who are chatting at the same time it can be necessary especially if stuff
[30289.96s -> 30295.80s]  starts to get out of hand or there's a big argument or a bunch of spam or something it's a good way to
[30295.80s -> 30309.93s]  kind of calm it down the low delay is amazing remember how it was before something would happen
[30311.27s -> 30316.55s]  and i would look over to the chat and it would take 10 to 15 seconds for me to see anything there
[30317.27s -> 30330.84s]  how did we manage before i don't even know but this is time and place for it like we said
[30331.40s -> 30339.30s]  talked about it already it might maybe it'll stay on for secure maybe maybe after another
[30339.30s -> 30344.95s]  six hours or so maybe i won't need it anymore we'll see it's not something i do all the time

[30933.13s -> 30951.06s]  that's pretty much it that's i that's essentially the entire story we also had garfield the monday
[30951.06s -> 30956.34s]  killer 250 here comes gar flock with a new garfo graph you're getting that pokemon sword and shield
[30956.34s -> 30961.94s]  game geronimo i know you don't give a hoot about pokemon but i always wanted to see a germa pokemon
[30961.94s -> 30967.14s]  team you don't care about competitive stuff so i'd it'd make for a fun team rather than the best
[30967.14s -> 30972.42s]  team lots of pokemon playthroughs have teams that look too similar but germ would do us right it
[30972.42s -> 30976.50s]  also gives a lot of new germa rubble characters it'd be more interesting than you are than you
[30976.50s -> 30981.62s]  think it'd be more interesting than you playing garfield's cart well i'll tell you i'll tell you
[30981.62s -> 30990.38s]  the team already it's uh the hypno what hip hip no what's it whatever his name is hypno top
[30992.10s -> 31009.91s]  um who's the what's the dirty rock the dirty rock guy geodude okay so hypno top geodude and
[31012.74s -> 31023.40s]  the weird like little mole bird that comes out of the ground this is like the little
[31025.22s -> 31039.00s]  yeah diglin yeah that's the team the mole bird is like a little mole a little gopher
[31039.00s -> 31045.13s]  but it's got a bird face there you go that's the dream team hey tingy thanks to the 250 for every
[31045.13s -> 31048.57s]  death in sicario you have to buy one lottery scratcher and dedicate an entire stream to
[31048.57s -> 31062.46s]  scratching them okay i'm serious okay that sounds fun sure was there a death counter tonight
[31071.11s -> 31078.39s]  and then and then and then whatever is one on the lottery tickets whatever's one on the scratch
[31078.39s -> 31092.84s]  tickets right whatever it is that goes back into community subs i'm into that that sounds fun
[31092.84s -> 31106.98s]  it's gonna be zero is gambling on stream terms of service i don't know i don't know
[31108.09s -> 31117.26s]  i don't think so if it's legal right don't people play like blackjack on twitch can i
[31117.26s -> 31125.03s]  like scratch like 45 scratch tickets gambling is a category right i i guys i live in las vegas
[31125.03s -> 31142.31s]  it's definitely legal here me streaming doing scratch shots and i look if you want to be
[31142.31s -> 31146.39s]  completely and totally like oh you don't like tell it like the gambling thing you don't want
[31146.39s -> 31150.15s]  to like make it look like fun no no i'm gonna write on the screen like do not fucking ever buy
[31150.15s -> 31156.15s]  these i'm gonna write like the word mistake 12 times it's gonna be around the screen while we do
[31156.15s -> 31166.92s]  it it was i think that'll be fine i'll double check to make sure that would be like okay with
[31166.92s -> 31177.38s]  twitch so yeah we'll see what should it be for every death should it be a dollar or like five
[31177.38s -> 31187.43s]  dollars because one dollar scratch offs don't win shit they have the worst probability five
[31187.43s -> 31192.31s]  dollars is a pretty good medium i think oh that's gonna be expensive though i have to be careful
[31192.95s -> 31214.94s]  if i die a hundred times like 125 to 150 times i died like 10 times just to the butterfly lady
[31218.47s -> 31222.79s]  we're at 15 it's got it's more i think it's more than 15 deaths today only at least 10 of them
[31223.59s -> 31229.85s]  only 10 were in the last 40 minutes you tell me i only died five times over the course of that
[31229.85s -> 31240.73s]  first seven hours in a way i probably died at least five to six to ten more times probably like 25
[31241.29s -> 31253.29s]  yeah yeah not resurrects we're going true deaths actual you get the ending not resurrect game over
[31254.01s -> 31263.45s]  we'll see how it turns out that's a fun idea though thank you tingy uh that was a great idea
[31271.08s -> 31276.63s]  it might have to be one dollar scratch tickets because if i died more than a hundred times
[31277.43s -> 31284.34s]  i don't know fuck it whatever you know what i mean that would be fun let me do a little bit of
[31284.34s -> 31288.98s]  research on that but thank you germa lied about minecraft vr he didn't but thanks to 250 i know

[31852.81s -> 31858.23s]  fast food gets a lot of bad rap but sometimes you just want to just drive down the street
[31859.03s -> 31864.87s]  and just pull up hit the brakes and get a bag of gross food and then you and you sit down you
[31864.87s -> 31869.03s]  eat it and you're like all right that was great just don't do it every day do it like once every
[31869.03s -> 31874.71s]  couple weeks or something and just enjoy it it's not gonna kill you you eating four cheesy gordita
[31874.71s -> 31881.26s]  crunches that's very bad for you but it's not if you do that like once a month or once every
[31881.26s -> 31896.02s]  couple months four is too much too i don't have that's no problem there just eat in and out
[31896.98s -> 31905.16s]  no in and out is i would say at least two or three rungs down the list behind shake shack
[31905.80s -> 31923.75s]  that's just i'm sorry i'm speaking with factual data in and out still good but i would if i could
[31923.75s -> 31932.74s]  get a shake shack burger is that i would get it over in and out every time shake shack's not as
[31932.74s -> 31954.98s]  good as five guys uh no i think it is i still think it is i still think it is i've eaten five
[31954.98s -> 31972.46s]  guys a lot i've had it a bunch of times you're on the west coast now oh yeah i'm in las vegas
[31974.07s -> 31978.87s]  this is in and out it's fucking everywhere out on the west coast here i've had it since being here
[31979.59s -> 31987.99s]  it's just like it's it's all right i don't know i i people this is worse than saying
[31989.99s -> 31995.83s]  i i'm gonna say this and people are gonna be really mad this is like saying witcher three is
[31995.83s -> 32007.13s]  not game of the year what am i about to say and that's in and out tastes the same to me
[32008.82s -> 32024.20s]  as a wendy's dave single i would kind of just rather go to wendy's because at least at wendy's
[32025.16s -> 32036.58s]  i can get their spicy chicken nugget get the fuck off my coast re i'm not on a coast actually
[32037.22s -> 32050.76s]  i'm landlocked i'm landlocked baby no coast here here i officially hate germa
[32054.63s -> 32061.67s]  but in and out is good look if we all liked the same things but i told you the squidward argument
[32061.67s -> 32068.31s]  already you want to eat canned bread and everybody loves the same place everybody eats the same food
[32068.31s -> 32078.86s]  everybody no i don't want to live in the squidward town what fast food mascot is the best
[32079.66s -> 32085.18s]  definitely definitely the king until they like killed him or something they got rid of him i
[32085.18s -> 32092.57s]  don't know why the scary king commercials were great where he was just like staring at people
[32092.57s -> 32098.15s]  and stuff it was like just so odd they still they still haven't i haven't seen him in a commercial
[32098.15s -> 32108.22s]  a long time yeah they killed him off in an episode one of the commercials and one of the
[32108.22s -> 32111.90s]  commercials he took like an arrow to the neck or something it was crazy he was wild you guys
[32111.90s -> 32113.26s]  remember don't remember that controversy
[32129.91s -> 32138.44s]  uh ronald mcdonald i feel like they just buried all these fast food cereal characters i haven't
[32138.44s -> 32145.42s]  when was the last ronald mcdonald commercial no they don't do that anymore guys every fast food
[32145.42s -> 32157.48s]  commercial is just two cool hip young people oh let me steal a fry oh delicious there's no
[32157.48s -> 32163.38s]  fucked up weird cartoon characters anymore the hamburger that doesn't get punched in the face
[32166.07s -> 32174.23s]  they tried here you go ready fast food commercials now are chilies and fridays commercials from 10
[32174.23s -> 32181.85s]  years ago look at all these people having like a great time they're sitting around dining in at
[32181.85s -> 32188.57s]  mcdonald's look at they're all smiling clinking glasses taking a big sip out of their drink nobody
[32188.57s -> 32201.30s]  gives a fuck no bring us our weird demented twisted cartoon characters they're all switch
[32201.30s -> 32222.78s]  commercials now and frankly i think it's bullshit what psycho goes to burger king to have a good
[32222.78s -> 32230.71s]  time i never noticed that they killed off a lot of the cartoon mascots till now yeah they did
[32238.02s -> 32242.26s]  uh you can say you can say what you want about kfc but at least kfc still has the
[32242.26s -> 32250.90s]  kernel in these commercials it's finger looking good my five dollar fill-up box is worth uh it's
[32250.90s -> 32264.18s]  waiting gold they still do that kfc sucks no it doesn't well then i'll level with you here
[32265.48s -> 32272.04s]  every other kfc sucks because sometimes you go to kfc and get a five star quality crispy delicious
[32272.52s -> 32279.48s]  uh perfect meal and then you go to the one down the street and it's like a lunch lady put pig
[32279.48s -> 32288.01s]  slop on your plate there is no in between kfc is either terrible terrible zero out of zero out of
[32288.01s -> 32296.12s]  five or perfect if they were more consistent i would eat there more often but they're just not
[32302.90s -> 32308.25s]  Popeyes is a lot better i've actually never had Popeyes i gotta change that
[32311.45s -> 32327.32s]  yeah i've never had it do they have Popeyes in vegas i don't know i think so order it right now
[32328.04s -> 32336.46s]  it's based off of the popular cartoon character of the same name
[32337.34s -> 32352.14s]  well wouldn't they serve spinach there Popeye didn't eat chicken he ate spinach it wasn't like
[32355.18s -> 32358.12s]  biting into like a big crispy chicken leg no he squeezed the
[32359.08s -> 32361.98s]  he squeezed the can as hard as he could and it shot out of the top
[32365.45s -> 32369.53s]  that marketing worked by the way i used to want to eat spinach so bad because
[32369.53s -> 32375.18s]  it looked so good when he ate it i was i didn't eat vegetables i hated them
[32375.74s -> 32379.98s]  it was very difficult for my parents to give me food that wasn't captain crunch
[32380.70s -> 32387.26s]  or like mac and cheese and a hot dog but holy shit that like propaganda campaign that they ran
[32387.26s -> 32399.32s]  for spinach worked on me bugs bunny eating carrots it worked i wanted carrots too am i
[32399.32s -> 32409.08s]  gonna go to pax east i am not i am currently not in the area i am on the west land walk

[32563.90s -> 32573.66s]  around the cup in your mouth if the answer is yes that is the same texture the same consistency
[32573.66s -> 32584.33s]  and the same mouth feel as the skin on a potato wedge i ruined it for you disgusting right you'll

[32778.68s -> 32784.92s]  since the change it's been somewhere between like 30 like 40 plus minutes rather than like
[32784.92s -> 32790.76s]  two to three hours sometimes you know well i that's an over exaggeration it never took like three
[32790.76s -> 32799.70s]  hours but it's definitely taken about an hour off the time at the end so the last few streams have
[32799.70s -> 32805.56s]  been about 30 minutes two hours has happened three hours maybe maybe it's only happened once
[32808.14s -> 32811.74s]  yeah it's only like 10 30 here in vegas i started really early i started at like one
