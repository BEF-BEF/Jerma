[4.02s -> 9.11s]  Hey, how's it going? I see that my title has changed.
[9.11s -> 13.03s]  Um, it's supposed to be Breath of the Wild,
[13.03s -> 17.43s]  Chill Zone, and I'm a little, a little irritated
[17.43s -> 21.91s]  that it was changed without my knowledge. I'm just a little
[21.91s -> 29.08s]  a little irritated about that. It was lame.
[29.08s -> 33.46s]  It's way funnier. Uh, no, you don't, no, you don't get it.
[33.46s -> 40.23s]  Nobody else is allowed to be funnier than me on my stream. Let's know how it
[40.23s -> 50.54s]  works. Ego Andy. Nobody said true.
[50.54s -> 55.78s]  Wow, I thought I was gonna see some trues. Okay,
[55.78s -> 59.46s]  uh, so let me give you a little bit of uh, what's gonna happen here today.
[59.46s -> 63.77s]  This is gonna be kind of a shorter stream. I
[63.77s -> 72.44s]  kind of feel like my head hurts and it's, I know why. I slept wrong.
[72.44s -> 75.88s]  I feel fine, but you know when you sleep wrong
[75.88s -> 80.28s]  and you know you slept wrong and you wake up and you're like, shit,
[80.92s -> 85.70s]  I kind of, if I don't go back to bed, then it's gonna be bad. It's gonna be worse,
[85.70s -> 90.58s]  right? And then you go back to bed and you sleep for another hour or two and
[90.58s -> 96.92s]  you wake up and you're way worse. I hate that. That's what
[96.92s -> 105.00s]  happened today. So, um, still gonna do the same plan
[105.00s -> 108.65s]  and maybe all the, maybe the horror game last night.
[108.65s -> 111.05s]  Maybe I had like a nightmare or something. I don't know. I mean, I may have had a
[111.05s -> 116.54s]  nightmare. But that, whatever. But yeah, here's what
[116.54s -> 119.74s]  we're gonna do. We're gonna do Breath of the Wild for like an hour or two.
[119.74s -> 124.38s]  And then we're gonna move to Gotham Knights uh, for the last couple of hours.
[124.38s -> 127.50s]  So the stream's probably gonna be like four hours,
[127.50s -> 132.06s]  maybe. I got some stuff I want to do later tonight and tomorrow I've got,
[132.06s -> 139.82s]  uh, I want to make sure I'm alert. So this will be probably like a four hour stream.
[139.82s -> 143.10s]  Uh, this will be the end of the Gotham Knights sponsored
[143.10s -> 151.03s]  content. I mean they, WB has just been, has been so good to this fucking channel.
[151.11s -> 155.27s]  I, like, that's all I can really say. They really have been.
[155.27s -> 160.07s]  Um, so if, if you guys want to like thank somebody, like it would,
[160.07s -> 163.27s]  WB has been one of the biggest contributors.
[163.27s -> 166.95s]  Uh, one of the biggest supporters of this stream in the last six plus months.
[166.95s -> 179.62s]  So, um, that's uh, they've been on point. It's been great. But that's not right now.
[179.62s -> 184.47s]  Right now we're gonna play Breath of the Wild and then later
[184.47s -> 188.23s]  in a couple of hours or so we're gonna do Breath of the Wild Gotham Knights.
[190.02s -> 193.22s]  I, I'm telling you I'm gonna be like chill today but I say that every time
[194.10s -> 206.95s]  and it never happens. So we'll see. Take a sip of this.
[209.24s -> 214.84s]  Ah, every time I say I'm gonna relax today, I end up, it ends up being the most like unhinged
[214.84s -> 218.44s]  stream of the week. So you know what? It's gonna be an insane day today.
[220.10s -> 223.30s]  It's gonna be so fucked up today. I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be loud,
[223.30s -> 226.26s]  I'm gonna be screaming, I'm gonna be making jokes. It's gonna be insane.
[226.26s -> 234.18s]  Just so you know. And here we are.
[234.18s -> 246.50s]  Uh, what was the last thing that I did? I'm trying to think. Where in the map are we?
[246.50s -> 250.73s]  Oh, right. I upgraded gear. Oh, no, no, no. I went through that weird maze thing
[250.73s -> 257.61s]  that everybody was mad at me about. Yeah, I brute forced the lost woods.
[257.61s -> 262.04s]  Well, I, I, excuse me, uh, you know, you think I need?
[262.84s -> 265.32s]  They're like, oh, I didn't know like the exact route.
[265.32s -> 271.54s]  No, I just put my chest out and fucking walk forward and I make it.
[271.54s -> 276.54s]  There's a raid? Oh, there is a raid. Oh, there is a raid.
[276.54s -> 281.13s]  There's like three raids. What is it? This is like a coordinated raid.
[283.24s -> 285.88s]  There's like three people raid me at the same time.
[285.88s -> 292.78s]  You look like a greasy today. I told, I was gonna scream, I was gonna say,
[292.78s -> 295.83s]  shut up to you. But I'm supposed to be chill today.
[295.83s -> 301.91s]  Uh, Jack Manifold, Slimesicle, and Oofs at the same exact time.
[301.91s -> 305.88s]  Just came in with like 3,000 people or something. I'm like, hi, guys.
[305.88s -> 310.50s]  Hey, everybody. What's up? Thanks for the raids.
[310.50s -> 313.06s]  All right, cool. Is triple raid song?
[313.06s -> 321.38s]  No, I'm supposed to be chilling out today. Oh.
[321.38s -> 325.06s]  Now, see, that was bad too. That was bad because I didn't give my all
[325.06s -> 328.42s]  because I have a headache today. And this is, this is your fault for making me do that.
[328.42s -> 330.74s]  You told me to do that. It's your fault. That was bad.
[330.74s -> 334.41s]  All right, we're gonna play Breath of the Wild.
[334.41s -> 337.61s]  Uh, welcome, everybody. Thanks for the raids. Hope you had good streams.
[337.61s -> 344.44s]  And, uh, I'm sorry. I, I can't, fuck, I can't press the button to turn the camera off.
[344.44s -> 347.40s]  That's like disconnected because I was trying to fix my camera from last night.
[347.40s -> 350.73s]  It's like glitching stuff. I still have no idea why that's happening.
[350.73s -> 357.80s]  All right, it's time to look over at the chat and have somebody tell me where I need to go next.
[357.80s -> 374.14s]  Because it's been about two weeks since I've opened the game. Just do it your way.
[379.45s -> 399.02s]  Okay, I'm going to go find a shrine. I'm going to do it my way.
[399.02s -> 409.08s]  Do the, do what's the Luddie? Do the Luddie?
[409.08s -> 415.26s]  Yes. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hit the Luddie, hit the Luddie.
[415.26s -> 419.06s]  Wait, is that the, is that the Ludwig dance? Is that like the this thing?
[419.06s -> 428.81s]  I don't know how to do it. And I feel like I don't have like real pants on, so I can't stand up.
[428.81s -> 435.08s]  It's like you go whim, whim, whim. Data tutorial, ask him.
[435.08s -> 438.84s]  I don't have real pants on. Well, like I do, but they're like, there's a big hole in the middle.
[443.72s -> 450.07s]  That sounded fucked up. Um, listen, it's because the button doesn't work.
[450.07s -> 455.66s]  Oh yeah, we're going to move on. I'll do the, I'll do the Luddie.
[455.66s -> 460.39s]  Just not now. I'll do, I'll try the Luddie. I have to study it for a little bit though.
[460.39s -> 468.44s]  I'll try it next stream. Uh, I need a shrine.
[468.44s -> 475.88s]  There's a tower over there. Should I just go to the tower? Why not, right?
[475.88s -> 483.30s]  I'm just going to go activate that tower. Let's go. I forget what P is.
[483.30s -> 495.78s]  Shrine is done over there. Yeah, I'm going for that tower straight ahead.
[495.78s -> 502.63s]  Wait, hold on a minute. Isn't Calamity Ganon over here? I have to be careful.
[502.63s -> 506.74s]  Oh, what's the toothpaste story? You're right. I forgot to tell you.
[506.74s -> 510.76s]  Okay. So I was trying to, I'm multitasking, right?
[510.76s -> 514.76s]  So I'm brushing my teeth and like walking around getting the stream kind of ready.
[515.56s -> 518.04s]  Uh, cause it was like, oh, brushing your teeth takes like a few minutes
[518.76s -> 533.10s]  and hold on a second. Pretty sick. Yeah. I think that deserves applause. I think.
[533.82s -> 543.48s]  Oh, nice. All right. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you for that.
[544.12s -> 549.56s]  What about you? But you know, does that cover both of you?
[551.34s -> 555.45s]  All right. That covers both of you. Does that cover, wait, do you have something?
[556.57s -> 563.42s]  That covers both of you. Mr. Green.
[565.02s -> 570.54s]  I'm not, how is that extortion? I just asked. I was like, is that covering both of you?
[572.39s -> 579.19s]  That's like, ah, that's kind of fucked up. I get like a gift and I pointed the,
[579.19s -> 583.82s]  does that cover both of you? Oh shit. That means you want two things.
[588.17s -> 590.97s]  All right. Anyways, the toothpaste story. So I'm walking around. I don't even know.
[590.97s -> 593.53s]  I forget where I was walking. Whatever. I'm going this way now.
[595.30s -> 601.29s]  So I'm walking around brushing my teeth and I was, I, my switch wasn't plugged in.
[602.74s -> 607.78s]  So I'm like, shit, where's the cord to the switch? And I'm, I don't know.
[607.78s -> 611.62s]  I'm kind of a monster of ultimate extreme convenience.
[612.50s -> 625.86s]  So I have a, I have an iPad that uses the USB-C right on the switch. And if I don't know where
[626.58s -> 630.26s]  that cord is, I will just rip it out of the back of the switch and plug it next to my bed.
[631.86s -> 641.19s]  It's just because it's just a USB-C power cable. So that's there. And hold on a second. I'm getting
[641.19s -> 651.27s]  speech jammed. So I'm trying to tell a story. Shut up. Yeah. Look over your head. It's fine.
[658.25s -> 663.24s]  I probably shouldn't be using this weapon, right? No, it's fine. This thing's good.
[667.06s -> 674.50s]  Just pause it. I'm right here. I'll be fine. Okay. That's fine. So anyways,
[675.70s -> 678.98s]  these skeletons are the most annoying enemy in the game, by the way, just running.
[679.54s -> 687.02s]  All right. So anyways, start from the beginning. I'll start from the beginning.
[687.02s -> 703.83s]  You don't really need to know, but Troy, where is it?
[712.82s -> 729.54s]  Is it up top? It's below me. I think. Where is it? No, it's down here. Yep. Nice. All right. Cool.
[730.26s -> 735.56s]  Let me heal before. Actually, we'll see what it is. All right. So anyways,
[737.59s -> 740.47s]  I'm walking around brushing my teeth. I'm trying to do two things at once. And I'm like, fuck,
[740.47s -> 744.39s]  I need my switch cord because I need it's plugged into the, where the bed is. So I pull it up from
[744.39s -> 749.03s]  the wall. And as I'm walking, remember the toothbrush with a bunch of foaming toothpastes
[749.03s -> 755.03s]  in my mouth. So I'm like, let me get it out of the back. And I go and I pull it out and I walk
[755.19s -> 760.55s]  and I start to pull the cord and it's a long cord. And there's a cup of water next to the,
[760.55s -> 764.07s]  where the bed is, you know, I want a cup of water so I can sip on it while I, before I sleep and
[764.07s -> 769.51s]  stuff, when I wake up, whatever. So the cord kind of wrapped around the water and pulled it down.
[771.08s -> 777.35s]  And I went like this. I went like, Oh, like, cause I don't obviously don't want to spill shit. And I
[777.35s -> 791.96s]  inhaled like a whole mouthful of fucking toothpaste and it still hurts. There's the whole story. You
[791.96s -> 811.50s]  deserved it. Yeah. Don't rush. Oh, it's too late to bet on this. I think combat trial. Oh,
[818.71s -> 827.27s]  I have a lot of good weapons though, but I'm scared. I want to use them all. This is just a,
[827.27s -> 834.95s]  all right. This is a full recovery and hearts. I do defense, maybe I'm just going to go super
[834.95s -> 851.22s]  hard. All right, here we go. Or there's another raid. Oh, there is another raid. I'm just getting
[852.18s -> 861.22s]  everybody's channel. Holy shit. Uh, RT, RT game. What's up, man? Thanks for the raid.
[862.50s -> 875.35s]  Welcome everybody. Currently playing breath of the wild. Uh, probably shouldn't use this weapon.
[875.35s -> 884.70s]  This thing's very heavy. It's all right. Did you, I didn't tweet the stream out. Oh shit. Yeah,
[884.70s -> 906.26s]  I'll tweet this remote. There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. What? Don't hurt me.
[906.34s -> 913.45s]  All right. What should I, what should I use? Probably the, uh, no, I don't, I want to save
[913.45s -> 924.95s]  that or the battle X. Yeah, I get two of these. Come on. What do you got? I got stuck on the
[924.95s -> 954.26s]  fucking wall. How come I'm not locked on? I guess I am. What just happened? I'm all right. So bad.
[954.26s -> 958.95s]  It's supposed to be an emote only mode. Turn it off. I don't want to see people write that.
[958.95s -> 976.18s]  That was awful reaction speed, by the way. That is another raid. How many people have,
[976.18s -> 985.99s]  is this like a joke on Twitch today? That's repster. What's up? Oh, right. I forgot what
[985.99s -> 1020.55s]  to do about this. That'd be something good at this. All right. Go ahead. Do the. Yeah.
[1022.07s -> 1051.19s]  Shoot your bow in the air. What is it doing? Oh shit. Right. You have to, you have to just
[1051.19s -> 1101.38s]  sprint, right? What the fuck? Why did that take so long from do that? Nice. Nice. Okay. I forgot
[1101.38s -> 1106.50s]  what the thing on the bottom right was. Um, until two seconds ago, I thought that was my gas tank
[1106.50s -> 1115.38s]  for some reason. I was like, Oh, I'm full. Like, Oh my, I need gas or something. I don't know
[1115.38s -> 1136.46s]  what's in here. Frost spear attack when the blade glows blue to chill the air and freeze your foe.
[1136.46s -> 1150.79s]  Yeah, bro. I have to shut up. Seriously. Um, tweet, tweet the stream. I don't even know.
[1150.79s -> 1153.91s]  My phone's not even up here. I don't even know where I have no idea. My phone even is.
[1155.11s -> 1161.42s]  It's not even up here. I tweet this. I will in a minute. I'll go take a pre break in like two
[1161.42s -> 1174.82s]  minutes. What should I get rid of? I don't think I can get rid of anything. Maybe the guardian
[1174.82s -> 1188.09s]  spear is this thing. This thing kind of sucks, doesn't it? Yeah. Guardian spear is meh. Yeah.
[1188.17s -> 1200.86s]  I'll use this instead. All right. So now I can think this should be enough to upgrade.
[1200.86s -> 1214.58s]  You have Jojo's bizarre adventure here. Um, all right. Is that a good thing? Jojo's bizarre
[1214.58s -> 1233.77s]  adventure here. Is this just like a swoop? He's talking about like a swoop. I got four of these
[1233.77s -> 1256.86s]  now. Should I do? I'm going to health, health, health. All right. I'm streaming. Right. I forgot.
[1256.86s -> 1262.23s]  I thought I was just sitting in the chair. All right. Let's go. Uh, I need to go to one of those,
[1262.23s -> 1274.22s]  uh, spirit places. Where's the nearest one? Although where's the guardian here? There was
[1274.22s -> 1283.74s]  that lizard guardian. Should I do the lizard? Should I try the lizard guardian that's behind
[1283.74s -> 1296.31s]  you? I think I was right about to do the lizard, uh, temple, right? What was that? Somebody just
[1296.31s -> 1327.00s]  went like, what was that? Where's my mask? There's a Korok nearby. Okay. Well, where is it? Up there
[1327.00s -> 1351.45s]  in the stump. Probably in the stump. No help. Nothing. Oh, it is in the stump. All right.
[1357.21s -> 1365.62s]  Nice. You got all these bat wings and don't miss the bat man. Gotham night stream coming up in
[1365.62s -> 1392.22s]  about an hour and a half or maybe an hour or so. Do I have something that can break this? Smash it.
[1392.46s -> 1410.87s]  Yes. Link. Stop climbing and smash it. Let go. This game is a 10 out of 10 for all of you.
[1411.43s -> 1430.06s]  This game is like a 9.9.8 now for me. Yeah. I mean, seriously, it was like a 10 out of 10.
[1430.70s -> 1446.12s]  Just went down to a 9.999990. It's definitely at the top, right? It just started raining right
[1446.12s -> 1468.94s]  when I get to this point. I'm trying to come up the tree. Can I just jump? I think I can just jump,
[1468.94s -> 1506.74s]  right? The climbing gear on 9.9 is bigger than 9.10. You, uh, I'm a bit first. It's raining
[1506.74s -> 1514.57s]  really hard. Cut the tree down. Is that what will that work? Why would I want to do that?
[1515.66s -> 1524.86s]  Yeah. Nine. I know. Okay. I said 9.999999999990. That's higher than 9.1111. Yeah, I know.
[1525.50s -> 1544.42s]  The rain is almost over. We just have to wait five minutes. Just campfire and then sleep.
[1547.86s -> 1553.46s]  I think that just sitting here for another 30 seconds will be fine. Climb the side of
[1553.46s -> 1560.38s]  the stump instead. Is this not getting hit by the rain? I mean, it is, but maybe I can just leap up
[1560.38s -> 1585.26s]  here. Do the tweet while you wait. I got it right here. I'm going to tweet. I'm going to
[1585.26s -> 1618.02s]  tweet while I wait. I'll be right back. Be right back. I'm going to tweet. Oh my goodness. Holly
[1618.02s -> 1623.18s]  is so cute. Can I just tell you that? So I just walked, I was like, oh, I'm going to go find my
[1623.18s -> 1630.57s]  phone. I walked over and I noticed that my phone was on the ground, like in front of, like with,
[1631.21s -> 1637.67s]  she slid it under the door. For a second I was like, why is my phone on the ground? Oh, that's
[1637.67s -> 1650.07s]  right. That's okay. That was really sweet. Okay. All right. What's a good tweet? Breath of, well,
[1650.07s -> 1663.74s]  I'm only going to be for Breath of the Wild for like an hour and 10 minutes. That's actually kind
[1663.74s -> 1671.82s]  of a funny, there's not another raid, right? No. Somebody just said that. I actually think that's
[1671.82s -> 1692.18s]  kind of funny. Breath of the Wild for an hour and 10 minutes. That's so stupid. That's a banger tweet.
[1692.18s -> 1705.58s]  It kind of is. There we go. All right. Now everyone's going to know I'm live and take a
[1705.58s -> 1732.76s]  look in that amount of time. We're good. I can get my seed here. I did it first. I have four of these
[1732.76s -> 1741.98s]  now. I know you can't see it, but I have four. It's not enough. I don't think. Cool. All right.
[1741.98s -> 1759.61s]  So that's good. Let me go examine stuff. Where the hero's sword? Do I have to,
[1759.61s -> 1763.80s]  should I just go back and do this? No, right. I need to have, right, right. I need to have a
[1763.80s -> 1770.89s]  certain amount of HP to even attempt it. I'm going to go back here. Let's get another good view
[1771.69s -> 1775.90s]  of the kind of the world around us from what tower? This tower here.
[1780.30s -> 1787.59s]  You need 13 hearts. What's the, what do you mean? The top Twitter reply. LOL.
[1790.22s -> 1808.54s]  Who's like the Joker? Let's see. This tweet sucks. All right. Guys, I don't use Twitter.
[1808.54s -> 1820.28s]  I don't use anything. Okay. So what else should I do in the next like hour or so?
[1825.61s -> 1836.33s]  It's an eye headache too. It's like right here. Do the tower. Oh, right. I was going to go to
[1836.33s -> 1846.94s]  that tower. That's right. There's three more shrines in this area. Really? In the forest?
[1846.94s -> 1860.97s]  Like this way? Shrines are my favorite part of this whole game. So I go over here. I don't see any
[1870.25s -> 1878.06s]  inside the forest. They're inside the forest. Just teleport inside. I was just seeing if I
[1878.06s -> 1898.09s]  could get a good view. I kind of have a bad time to get transported somewhere. Talk to the Koroks.
[1898.09s -> 1905.19s]  Do you pretend to read comments out in chat? Um, I think what happens and I've seen people
[1905.19s -> 1909.11s]  be like, what are you talking about? I think as the chat moves fast and I only have a brief
[1909.11s -> 1915.03s]  second to kind of go like this, I will see, I think a lot of streamers do this too.
[1915.03s -> 1923.29s]  Where you will see like, let's say the sentence has 10 words in it. I'll see like word one,
[1923.29s -> 1927.61s]  word four, five, six, and word eight. And I kind of have to be like, all right,
[1927.61s -> 1935.27s]  I'm going to fill in the blank. Does that answer your question? Sometimes I can see the whole thing
[1935.91s -> 1940.36s]  depending how fast the chat is moving. All right. So I got to talk to the Koroks,
[1942.62s -> 1945.18s]  which they're in like the village I'm imagining, right?
[1946.86s -> 1962.31s]  They're like down in here. There's one here. Where's like the proper village village where
[1962.31s -> 1984.36s]  they're all hanging out and there's like shops and stuff. Oh, it's you. All right. I have seeds.
[1984.36s -> 1989.54s]  All right. How much is it? What should I get? Another weapon stash? It's three for another
[1989.54s -> 1996.01s]  weapon. I have four. I feel like I'm always low on weapons. I always feel like I need more weapons
[1997.29s -> 2002.20s]  or bow. I'm doing weapons. I'm always throwing stuff away.
[2006.52s -> 2014.01s]  Fields are fine. Just dodge forehead. You know what I mean?
[2015.66s -> 2028.81s]  I don't think I have enough to do anything. Go into the tree now.
[2035.10s -> 2050.71s]  Um, wait, who's that? Oh, you could it be your Mr. Hero. Mr. Hero is here. The mushroom on my
[2050.71s -> 2058.18s]  head suddenly sprouted today, so I knew something was up. It was a prediction that you'd come,
[2058.18s -> 2063.94s]  I think. Us Koroks all got together and prepared some trials just for you, Mr. Hero.
[2064.66s -> 2069.14s]  If you pass the very tough trials we prepared, pulling out the master sword would be a piece of
[2069.14s -> 2075.99s]  cake. Probably. Among the trials is an extra tough one designed by me, the elder of Korok Forest.
[2076.55s -> 2085.32s]  So will you test your mettle in the Korok trials? I'll do it. You're gonna get conned eventually if
[2085.32s -> 2088.52s]  you just keep doing what everybody asks you to. Anyways, where was I? Oh yeah, the Korok trials.
[2089.08s -> 2092.12s]  Long story short, you need to visit all the shrines in Korok Forest so that you can be
[2092.12s -> 2099.38s]  considered a real grown-up. Trial one in the southwest forest. Trial of second sight. Trial
[2099.38s -> 2106.39s]  two in the northwest forest. The lost pilgrimage. Trial three. I would say the worst of the three
[2106.39s -> 2111.86s]  movies. The test of wood. That does sound like the worst of them, by the way. That sounds like the
[2111.86s -> 2119.56s]  shittiest movie out of them all. You can overcome the Korok trials. Oh, and here comes Star Wars.
[2120.28s -> 2138.02s]  Episode eight. A test of wood. The other two were way cooler sounding. Okay, so I just have to go
[2138.02s -> 2145.29s]  find them. What about you? It's Mr. Hero. Yay, Mr. Hero came to visit us in the forest. What
[2145.29s -> 2151.35s]  took you so long? Peek's thought of a trial that will make Mr. Hero stronger. You won't have to
[2151.35s -> 2166.41s]  fight and it's not scary. Thermofans that are in their mid-40s are plus twoing that. I would have.
[2166.41s -> 2172.92s]  You'll need to be extra careful so I want to see a Bloopy. It's a blue glowy hoppy thing that glows
[2172.92s -> 2179.22s]  in the dark just about Peek's size. I just really want to see a Bloopy even if it's just a picture
[2179.22s -> 2189.24s]  of one. All right, I'll take a picture of a Bloopy. What's a Bloopy? I knew you were a nice guy, Mr.
[2189.24s -> 2201.40s]  Hero. Thanks for listening to Peek's requests. It's a little blue bunny. Oh, okay. Well, he just
[2201.40s -> 2208.02s]  explained it while I was asking you. I looked over, missed the part where he said what it was
[2208.02s -> 2226.09s]  because I was asking you guys. Okay, cool. Anybody else have anything in here? I have plenty of food.
[2226.65s -> 2234.41s]  Oh, Mr. Hero, welcome to the great Deku Tree's navel. Made a bed out of leaves just for you,
[2234.41s -> 2239.85s]  Mr. Hero. Take as long as you like with yawns and disease. Um, I have full health, I don't really
[2239.85s -> 2245.78s]  get it. You look like a million rupees. Yeah, I would have guessed that a Bloopy was a blue
[2245.78s -> 2259.56s]  rupee. That's what I thought it was. Sleep, sleep, sleep in the bed, sleep. Why is everybody saying
[2259.56s -> 2272.07s]  sad? Mr. Hero. That just reminds me of Otto. I always say Mr. and then whatever Otto currently
[2272.07s -> 2282.89s]  is doing. Oh, here you go, Mr. Treat. I looked, missed a good boy. Oh, Mr. Hungry, right? It's
[2282.89s -> 2293.16s]  just he's Mr. whatever he's currently doing. Okay, here's the shop. Mr. Otto. All right, what do you
[2293.16s -> 2310.12s]  have? Okay. Can we get a running gag for the rest of the stream? You mean you want me to do like Mr.
[2310.12s -> 2318.25s]  Otto stuff for the rest of the stream? All right, where are these shrines? One was north west. Talk?
[2318.89s -> 2327.48s]  To what? Ah, if you hope to extract the sword, you'll need to summon a hero's strength.
[2328.70s -> 2341.70s]  Let us see how brightly your life force burns. The wise mystical tree. Okay, so I have to go
[2342.84s -> 2352.07s]  north west. So it's imagining it's probably here. Can I just go here? The other one was south
[2352.07s -> 2370.23s]  something south. I have to select the quest. I don't want to. Oh, this one. Where is it?
[2372.22s -> 2392.47s]  There it is. Oh, very cool. Is anybody okay? I hate to say this because this is like a really cool
[2392.47s -> 2399.93s]  thing. But when I see this sword, I don't think that looks powerful. I think that looks like it's
[2399.93s -> 2406.86s]  on the shelf at Walmart. Like that exact thing is on the shelf at Target. And it's like it's
[2406.86s -> 2413.30s]  just like, look, it's a toy at Target. And I just go, it looks cool. But that thing's made out of
[2413.30s -> 2424.62s]  foam to me. Oh my god, I must hold my setup down. It's a cool and it sucks because that's
[2424.62s -> 2437.94s]  like a really cool design, but it's turned into a full foam toy for me. Yeah, I've contemplated
[2437.94s -> 2443.66s]  buying it. Any times I've walked by that toy, I made not making the entire story up just to make
[2443.66s -> 2450.68s]  it very clear. How many times I've walked by that sword at Target and gone, you know,
[2452.04s -> 2455.64s]  that might look pretty good on my shelf. And then everybody in the audience is laughing.
[2455.64s -> 2461.96s]  Like I'm a comedian. You know what I mean? Like, and I go like this. Look at the microphone. Like,
[2467.42s -> 2476.34s]  you what? Why are you clout chasing actual liar? Well, no, it's not entirely inaccurate.
[2476.34s -> 2491.62s]  Keep going and not get lost in the mist. Oh shit. I this is okay. Don't worry. I've got a cryptic
[2491.62s -> 2497.46s]  little hint for you. Hungry trees will show you the way spy their iron to win the day.
[2497.72s -> 2521.24s]  Didn't make that sound cool. Okay. So where do I go? I'm kidding. I'm not doing that again.
[2521.24s -> 2528.60s]  I'm kidding. Everyone just freaked out. They're like, no, dude, don't do that again.
[2530.07s -> 2540.30s]  Okay. The trees have iron. They like the way you'll make your way out of here. Link any day,
[2541.91s -> 2550.63s]  check the ground, check the air. What does that actually mean though? They have like iron deposits
[2550.63s -> 2572.98s]  on the ones that I can go walk over to or something. I just see somebody sitting. It's like a school
[2572.98s -> 2577.85s]  play to me. I just see somebody sitting like the person that plays the piano the whole time.
[2577.85s -> 2582.49s]  You know, it's like that older like lady usually is playing the piano and right now there's a scene
[2582.49s -> 2591.00s]  going on and she's sitting down in that little pit. It's like, like, and the kids are all up
[2591.00s -> 2599.96s]  there doing their scene. I don't think anybody realizes like how unbelievably talented and how
[2599.96s -> 2607.59s]  much stress that fucking job was. And I think a lot of them were just doing it for free. Oh, hey,
[2607.59s -> 2611.35s]  you need to know literally all the music. You need to know every single song you needed. You need to
[2611.35s -> 2616.79s]  be the cue for every single fucking actor. And by the way, you're going to an entire audience
[2616.79s -> 2622.62s]  of people watching you play the piano and you are the quarterback of the entire show. What?
[2622.62s -> 2632.20s]  That seems like you're the only, you're the sole musician of the entire play. Oh, there we go.
[2633.96s -> 2660.74s]  Iron leads the way. No iron there. You know what else is crazy about those musicians?
[2662.41s -> 2667.21s]  Those kids would just fuck up all the time and the timing would change in the song
[2667.94s -> 2674.55s]  in real time to change the song. So it matched what the kid was fucking singing.
[2675.19s -> 2687.35s]  Do you understand how unbelievable that is? That's unbelievable. The song would change mid song and
[2687.35s -> 2691.35s]  they would fix, fix, fix it. And I'm doing a different tempo, the same song, different tempo
[2691.35s -> 2732.36s]  to match your singing. Okay. Well, there's another one iron. No, no iron. No. Oh my God. I didn't
[2732.36s -> 2740.71s]  want to do that. I was trying to zoom the camera in. I went the wrong way. Just find the iron in
[2740.71s -> 2765.75s]  the trees. This one here is the iron in this one. What are you doing here? It's supposed to be like
[2765.75s -> 2792.84s]  a magical forest. Wait, you want to shoot that? Yeah, no. Do I have to break it? I tried to swing
[2792.84s -> 2819.64s]  at it. Iron lights the way. It's the only way. Find your way through the forest. With luck,
[2819.64s -> 2831.02s]  you won't act like a tourist. What was the poem? Yes. Yes. Yes. I don't know what that means.
[2832.82s -> 2843.90s]  Go through them. Wait, that one has iron. Which one? The other one has iron in its mouth.
[2844.54s -> 2881.64s]  I don't see anything else with iron. Like from here, this one. Okay. Iron camera, camera, camera,
[2881.64s -> 2905.85s]  camera. Okay. Take a picture of it. Oh, and then I can track where the iron is in the mobs.
[2906.81s -> 2918.54s]  Look at that. I get it. Then I can set it to the tracker. I get it. Okay. Let's do it. Start over.
[2920.62s -> 2939.37s]  Yeah, that's fine. Start over. Okay. So first one's over here. Let's get the camera out and
[2948.33s -> 2962.92s]  no. Gatorade. Yeah. Lightning. Yeah. Shoot it with a lightning arrow.
[2965.58s -> 2969.02s]  I don't even have a lightning arrow. I don't even have shock arrows.
[2985.30s -> 2991.48s]  Lightning picture. Picture of a lightning. Take a picture of the lightning. Football. Football.
[2991.48s -> 2996.94s]  Football. He scored. Take a picture of the lightning. Blah, blah, blah. Fool. Fool. You're
[2996.94s -> 3001.50s]  a fool. Put your arm in the air. It's this way, right? Because he's pointing this way.
[3005.96s -> 3029.40s]  Here's another one. Where are you pointing? Orc. Am I going to do this for like the whole time
[3029.40s -> 3047.35s]  before I play Gotham Knights? One of the mods just tell me where to go. All right. Just translate
[3047.35s -> 3056.89s]  one of the hieroglyphics. What do they mean by this? Just translate one of them. The ref does
[3056.89s -> 3065.14s]  not mean football. I'll tell you that much. Yeah. I mean, it's not that Legend of Zelda
[3065.14s -> 3089.56s]  presents Madden 2025. It's the shape. All right. Well, I'm not helping you anymore.
[3089.56s -> 3114.82s]  Piece of shit. Hey. Hey. Hey. Okay. Lightning. Arms up. Do I have to get struck by lightning?
[3114.82s -> 3117.06s]  Do I have to stand on top and like have lightning strike or something?
[3124.20s -> 3129.61s]  Did I just fucking softlock myself? No. All right. Picture. Picture. Picture. Up, up, up, up, up.
[3141.67s -> 3162.18s]  No, no. Octopus arm. Lightning. What shape are the arms making? Yeah. All right. Let me defend
[3162.18s -> 3217.45s]  myself. I need to defend myself. I forgot that the magnet power was in the game. What is going on?
[3217.45s -> 3232.44s]  It won't come out of the mouth. It was making a sound. Okay. Down, up, down, left. Why does it
[3232.44s -> 3251.70s]  say like put it down? I can't. You're almost there, dude. Take a picture of it. When it's
[3251.70s -> 3261.27s]  push, pull up, down, take a picture of it. It doesn't make any sense. Remember the poem.
[3261.27s -> 3269.21s]  I don't remember the poem. Let me ask the guy again. I can dodge a fucking battleaxe. I can't
[3269.21s -> 3275.05s]  wait. I cannot wait until everyone's like, oh, you know, I'm not going to like say he's like,
[3275.05s -> 3279.77s]  you know, I'm fucking stupid anymore. Cause like that stream was crazy. Like, holy shit.
[3280.76s -> 3291.58s]  Hungry trees will show you the way. Spy their iron to win the day. Do I just have to hold it
[3291.58s -> 3322.81s]  and walk away? Spy their iron. So where's the next one? Cause I'm currently permanently banned
[3322.81s -> 3331.94s]  the person that told him to go back into the woods. Shit. Yeah, I did. Like two of you said
[3331.94s -> 3337.06s]  to go do these. You're the reason why I looked over and I was like, yeah. All right. All right.
[3337.06s -> 3351.69s]  Illuminati eyeball. Illuminati eye. The Illuminati. I don't know. Eyeball. Lightning in the eye.
[3352.57s -> 3359.93s]  Illuminati eye. Lightning eye. Lightning in the eye. Shoot the eye with lightning. I don't have,
[3359.93s -> 3373.98s]  I don't have any shock arrows. Magnet eye. Magnet eye. Magnetize the eye. Magnet on the eye.
[3374.71s -> 3378.55s]  Why did I come in here? I'm going to leave. I'm going to leave. I'm going to go to the shrine.
[3379.11s -> 3389.45s]  I can't get stuck here for like an hour. Magnetize the eye. Magnet eye. Magnet eye.
[3389.45s -> 3394.17s]  Magnet eye. Magnet on the eye. I'm not getting stuck here for an hour.
[3394.89s -> 3400.18s]  I would, this is like the street you come back to and you just like melt on the couch and you
[3400.18s -> 3405.64s]  just don't care that like no one can watch you do this for an hour. Take a picture of the magnet
[3411.38s -> 3422.46s]  frame. Magnet frame. Magnet then picture. But how do I even activate that?
[3440.68s -> 3471.48s]  Magnet. What am I looking for? So magnet and then eye. Look. Magnet and look. Magnet then look. Eye.
[3472.36s -> 3483.22s]  Magnet. Look. Magnet then look at the eye. Magnet then look. All right. I'm magnet,
[3483.22s -> 3499.72s]  I'm magneting right now and I'm looking and nothing's happening. Don't magnet the iron
[3499.72s -> 3523.70s]  because it'll show up in the, don't mag, just magnetize and walk around.
[3523.70s -> 3537.72s]  Don't, I threw that. I didn't want to. All right. Where's the one from here then?
[3543.67s -> 3563.50s]  I just heard Ollie laugh. I heard it. I just heard it. I overthink everything.
[3564.06s -> 3574.76s]  Really? I always do this. I play chess when the game's playing checkers. I do it every time. I
[3574.76s -> 3581.34s]  seriously do. The last time I was here, it was like, oh, I need to find the song and go to the
[3581.34s -> 3586.14s]  beat and turn my back backwards to the song and go backwards. It's like, no, dude, the flame is just
[3586.14s -> 3605.29s]  pointing in the direction you're supposed to walk. It was so simple. Okay. But where the hell is the
[3605.29s -> 3665.21s]  other one? There's one right here. There it is. There it is. Yeah. Get over there. Edit your tweet
[3665.29s -> 3672.57s]  stuck in the Kokiri forest for an hour and 10 minutes. I need to, I hate these enemies.
[3672.57s -> 3682.25s]  They're so annoying. Skeleton enemies in every game are so stupid. They're like, you killed it,
[3682.25s -> 3688.97s]  but you didn't. It's growing back to life. No, just die. Just let it be. Skeletons always do this.
[3689.77s -> 3697.14s]  We need some variety in the skeleton enemies that we face in these games. They can't all be this.
[3697.94s -> 3704.79s]  What have I happened to the skeletal mage, by the way, like just like casting like
[3704.79s -> 3708.71s]  fucking fireballs and stuff. What happened? We haven't seen that since like Diablo two.
[3708.71s -> 3723.00s]  There's a rusty shield. Feed me the age shield guarded by monsters. Eternal. My brother will
[3723.00s -> 3778.33s]  repay you in kind. I have to shut up. Okay. So that chest, where'd that chest go? That's it.
[3779.96s -> 3795.82s]  One Amber, one Amber for doing this. Is there a leaf anywhere? Do I have anything? Can I just
[3795.82s -> 3801.72s]  like swing this and now it needs to be a leaf. I don't have a leaf. I just swim over there.
[3806.01s -> 3840.15s]  Oh, this one. Use the ice. Yeah, but I want to, when do I ever get to do this? Please place my
[3840.15s -> 3896.15s]  chest in my mouth. The shield eaters brothers stole it from me. Okay. And what does that do for us?
[3900.33s -> 3922.42s]  Oh hell yeah. That's sick. That's sick. Let's get a big fish.
[3933.26s -> 3944.97s]  Do bets. Um, you can get it done quickly. Yeah, do it. Place your bets. Will I do this in
[3944.97s -> 3967.06s]  seven minutes or less? Seven minutes or less? No bets. We do no bets. Just go. No, this one's
[3967.06s -> 3994.22s]  just free. Wait. Oh, you mean like actually free? Oh, you're still betting. Who is betting against
[3994.22s -> 4013.59s]  this? 25. Oh guys. Um, 32 million versus versus how many? 37, 38 million versus 900,000.
[4014.15s -> 4028.02s]  Interesting. We'll be back in 10 minutes. Take a quick break. Can you imagine? Yeah, that was fun.
[4031.16s -> 4045.67s]  Giant ancient core. These are important. I've been told that was a pretty cool shrine.
[4045.67s -> 4052.97s]  The staircase going up was a little challenging trying to get like one, two, three, four, five,
[4052.97s -> 4059.69s]  you know, one foot in front of the other. It was kind of a challenge. Now getting back down is
[4059.69s -> 4062.81s]  another story though, because that's going to be a little harder. It's a little steeper.
[4073.80s -> 4080.62s]  You're a scammer. I'm not a scammer. That was it. It will be a scam for me to keep that
[4080.62s -> 4100.76s]  hole in place. So now I can just walk around. I'm going to go to the other ones. Yeah,
[4100.76s -> 4121.19s]  bring me to the entrance. Ooh, the Luddy. Nice armpits. I burn so much fuel. I don't think
[4121.19s -> 4134.86s]  people just don't get this. I burn so much fuel inside. There's not a heart in here.
[4135.42s -> 4139.74s]  There is this like engine just with like, just like smoke and steam.
[4143.26s -> 4164.31s]  I'm just like an engine that's constantly burning fluid and like fuel. I run so hot.
[4164.31s -> 4180.87s]  I really am like a lizard. It's not a brain in there either. Apparently. Wow. You motherfucker.
[4189.21s -> 4197.82s]  Whoa. That was, wow, that was rough. That was rough. I'll take that one. I just underhanded you
[4197.82s -> 4211.46s]  of a fucking Nerf ball. Okay. Test of wood. You need to equip the Korok weapon set. Sure.
[4212.34s -> 4217.66s]  You have to keep the sword, bow and shield equipped the whole time. If they break or you
[4217.66s -> 4248.47s]  unequip them. I thought he said you die. I'm sorry. Oh my God. That didn't break in the face.
[4249.64s -> 4259.32s]  I didn't think, I thought it was just going to phase through them. I'm so sad.
[4260.86s -> 4271.66s]  I'm so sad. I didn't want to do that. My goodness. Okay. I have enough for, oh my God.
[4272.38s -> 4280.22s]  I have enough for a shield. What about bow? I got to drop a bow, I think.
[4283.22s -> 4312.22s]  Knight's bow probably. Yeah, I'll drop this. I've been using it. I feel so bad. Drop the frinic.
[4312.22s -> 4318.50s]  Last time I wanted to drop the frinic, everyone was like, don't do it. Don't do it. It's like one
[4318.50s -> 4324.78s]  of the best bows in the game. It's been sitting there the whole time. Go reach the shrine, but
[4324.78s -> 4332.18s]  nothing can break. By the way, I just want to say, I'm really sorry to you. I'm trying to apologize
[4332.18s -> 4352.07s]  to him. I'm really sorry that I threw that at you. Okay. We're cool. Do I need to fight anything?
[4352.07s -> 4389.05s]  Why don't I just run? I don't have to fight anything. Just make it to the shrine. What happened?
[4389.05s -> 4396.01s]  I have to stay in the fence. Oh, I jumped. That's why. All right. Well, I'm going to do this.
[4396.01s -> 4441.21s]  I went out of bounds. Okay. I get it. That's fine. Okay. Stay in the fence. Does this
[4441.21s -> 4467.61s]  count as staying in the fence right here? Does this count? That was scary. I can jump over this,
[4467.61s -> 4506.95s]  right? I have to break these. Wait, don't unequip. How do I? I don't want to shoot this. Whatever.
[4506.95s -> 4557.90s]  Okay. This way. What the hell was that? I should probably heal. What? Just run? Why would you tell
[4557.90s -> 4567.93s]  me to do that right now? What? Just run? Just run into the quicksand. Dude, what are you doing?
[4567.93s -> 4574.81s]  Just run. Run. Just run. So I just run. You didn't say just run in the parentheses bracket.
[4574.81s -> 4579.77s]  Watch out for the quicksand. You said run in all capitals. Run. Run. So I did what you said.
[4580.49s -> 4588.46s]  Jeremy, I'm really high. Have you ever seen your side profile? I feel like you would look like a
[4588.54s -> 4605.58s]  moon. What do you think? Dude, just run. Hurry up. What are you doing? Stop stalling.
[4605.58s -> 4615.43s]  Run. Just run. Okay. I'm just going to. I would have said if I was in the chat,
[4616.47s -> 4624.92s]  dude, run, but watch out ahead. It's a cautionary quicksand here. So how am I supposed to get
[4624.92s -> 4633.43s]  through this? I want to make ice. All right. Well, I have to kill some of these things.
[4649.00s -> 4658.54s]  Hmm. What should I eat? How about just like, yeah, I don't need whatever. I'll eat a roasted bass
[4660.31s -> 4673.93s]  and an egg. No, that's enough. Not here. I mean, the chili fish skewer seems pretty good.
[4677.16s -> 4687.64s]  Dude, watch out. Somebody say Wellington. Did you bring that back? Did somebody bring back the
[4687.64s -> 4720.73s]  Wellington? Everyone hated that. I have to heal these things. This is so annoying. All right. Nice.
[4720.73s -> 4736.70s]  We're good. I freaked out. I'm fine. Oh, you can have three. I thought you could only have
[4736.70s -> 4752.55s]  two up at one time. Did that upgrade? I thought it was only two. It was three. It's always been
[4752.55s -> 4761.48s]  three. Oh, I'm going to take another Tylenol. God damn it. All right. No, I'm going to relax now.
[4761.48s -> 4784.10s]  I'm going to chill. Like I said, I was going to. I was trying to. No. I was like, what happened?
[4784.74s -> 4790.18s]  I was trying to throw. I was trying to drop the stupid twig that I had equipped.
[4790.18s -> 4794.01s]  I wasn't trying to unequip it. I was just trying to get rid of it. I should have just dropped it
[4794.01s -> 4818.47s]  in my oven. Whatever. I got. You relaxed way too hard. Jeremy, you need to run, but be cautious
[4818.47s -> 4823.51s]  where there is quicksand ahead. If you don't already know, quicksand is a dangerous and can quickly
[4823.51s -> 4827.43s]  engulf link and potentially give you a game over. I hope this information is found useful in your
[4827.43s -> 4831.59s]  playthrough of the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. Thanks. That's what I'm talking about.
[4836.09s -> 4841.77s]  No, I, I'm going to drop that in the inventory. That counts, right?
[4841.77s -> 4885.35s]  Jeremy, you should eat a slice of epic bacon. All right. Drop this stupid thing. Drop that.
[4885.35s -> 4908.09s]  What else do I don't want that is just clogging up my inventory like a huge turd? Why did you say
[4908.09s -> 4923.08s]  that? I don't know. I have a headache today. It's fucking fucked up and gross. I don't care.
[4923.96s -> 4960.36s]  I just don't. Oh shit. It didn't jump when I hit the button. It didn't jump when I hit the button.
[4960.36s -> 4965.72s]  It didn't jump when I hit the button. I, I hit, I swear to God, sometimes I will hit jump and the
[4965.72s -> 4979.48s]  input will just not process because I'm on the wrong frame. Oh, it's like I hit the jump button
[4979.48s -> 4983.96s]  and it's like a frame that isn't done being rendered. So it's like, no, you didn't.
[4988.74s -> 5012.12s]  Actually, that is not a bad strategy though. Get past this quick. Um, wait, do I have defense?
[5012.84s -> 5034.87s]  Yeah, I'm going to do the defense boost. Let's do speed instead. All right. Where's the fire guy?
[5060.84s -> 5069.43s]  I promise you that like no human runs off an edge and doesn't press jump. I, I promise you,
[5069.43s -> 5075.88s]  I promise you I'm hitting the jump button. I, I'm what I'm telling you. That's what's happening.
[5077.59s -> 5082.23s]  Like no human is like, oh, I'm going to put that there. I'm just going to walk off the edge.
[5082.23s -> 5101.18s]  No, you, I'm going to jump. No, we're doing it my way. You fucking idiot.
[5102.46s -> 5106.22s]  It's just Mr. Bean episode. Every time I play breath of the wild, apparently
[5107.02s -> 5135.70s]  it's literally an episode of Mr. Bean. I said I'm Mr. Bean. I'm going, I don't care. What are you
[5135.70s -> 5157.10s]  linking me? Change the armor. I, okay. I am self flustered. You have no idea. I'm like, somebody,
[5157.10s -> 5161.18s]  I looked over here and somebody linked me like a big bird walking around on the stage and I,
[5161.18s -> 5166.86s]  I'm fucking flustered as hell. Somebody looking at the airplane window or something. I don't know
[5166.86s -> 5183.54s]  what's going on over here. Did you, did you do Botox? No, I'm going to do it my way today.
[5183.54s -> 5213.46s]  Why do I want to change my armor? It's not that hard. No, it's not. I'm just distracted.
[5213.46s -> 5223.32s]  Let's get this up with better defense. Yeah. Okay. We're doing this my way.
[5251.51s -> 5273.26s]  I need arrows. I have no arrows. I do now. Like, what can I take? Hey, oh, arrow. Okay.
[5273.26s -> 5294.49s]  I actually would rather attack these guys. That's exactly what I needed.
[5332.87s -> 5339.86s]  I need to buy arrows. Oh no, I don't. I am fucking furious. I already. Yeah. Okay. Here's the
[5339.86s -> 5345.93s]  problem. I already beat this shit, but then I went into my inventory and scrolled to a different item
[5345.93s -> 5350.41s]  in the game went, ah, ah, ah, you can't do that here. Ah, ah, ah. I wasn't trying to equip it. I
[5350.41s -> 5401.85s]  was just trying to throw it away. I don't want my head hurts. What I don't care if this fucking
[5401.85s -> 5430.84s]  thing breaks. I'm not embarrassing myself for another 10 minutes. Get up there. Do you have
[5430.84s -> 5475.59s]  any arrows up here? Swing the sword. I beat the last boss in Sekiro in like less than three hours.
[5475.59s -> 5490.62s]  I don't care what anybody says. Okay. So there's nothing else shooting at me. There's nothing
[5490.62s -> 5499.05s]  else attacking me. Right. We're good. I'm to go and I can dodge a battle X in real life.
[5511.19s -> 5528.65s]  I can't just launch it back at him and kill him. You go down too quickly. Don't you dare.
[5533.46s -> 5548.46s]  The person's not even shooting at me. Okay. I'm going to block you. Good. Okay. Oh shit,
[5548.46s -> 5557.80s]  it's going to break. Stop doing the Mario. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everybody. I'm so sorry.
[5557.80s -> 5561.80s]  I'm so sorry. Just doing the Mario thing where you jump because you make the jump,
[5561.80s -> 5565.80s]  but then you freak out and you jump backwards and then you freak out and jump forwards.
[5565.80s -> 5579.78s]  I did the Mario thing. You know what I mean? When you jump, you do a hard jump in Mario and
[5579.78s -> 5583.62s]  you don't have the confidence that you made it. So you freak out and press the button again,
[5584.84s -> 5588.52s]  which makes you jump a second time. And then you are overcompensating going backwards.
[5588.52s -> 5597.80s]  You know what I'm talking about. I did the Mario. The game is not respawning the enemies.
[5597.80s -> 5603.18s]  I think I broke the actual game. I'm getting, yeah. No, nothing's respawning.
[5611.22s -> 5614.18s]  I'm just going to shoot you. I don't care how far away this is. I don't care what kind of
[5614.18s -> 5620.54s]  fucking arrow type it is. You have to die. You too over there. I'm not going to get embarrassed
[5620.54s -> 5640.17s]  again. Go ahead. Do it. Get up. Why are you all of a sudden? You don't want to get up now?
[5641.74s -> 5675.51s]  Good. Where are you?
[5700.84s -> 5720.79s]  Right there. I don't care how expensive these things are. It's worth it. There are a couple,
[5720.79s -> 5725.24s]  look at there in the ground over here. See it? I can see them right there. There's one here and
[5725.24s -> 5734.33s]  there's one here. How come I can't kill them? Oh, those are just twigs. I'm fine. What's this for?
[5735.53s -> 5743.51s]  Did I just walk it up? Let's see. What's going on here?
[5745.19s -> 5769.78s]  Ow. I just feel like I'm so nuts for this, but I don't care. I could have just made the jump,
[5769.78s -> 5783.94s]  right? No, I don't care. If I skip it, is it going to be mad at me? Is it going to be pissed
[5783.94s -> 5800.68s]  off if I do this? I'm not going to get disqualified if I do this, right? I made it. Oh my God. Thank
[5800.68s -> 5808.66s]  goodness. I can finally. Oh my God. That was so, it should not have been like that. It just
[5808.66s -> 5823.69s]  shouldn't have been like that. It shouldn't have been like that. I don't ever want to do that again.
[5823.69s -> 5847.35s]  In fact, I want to delete that from my memory. It was fine. I got one more trial. What was the
[5847.35s -> 5879.13s]  last one? Yeah, I think these are reward only shrines. Yeah, I have this would be number six
[5879.13s -> 5888.90s]  for orbs. Did you drop the game to a nine point eight? No, it's still a nine. Well,
[5888.90s -> 5907.26s]  it's a nine something so far. It's a nine something. It's definitely higher than nine point
[5907.26s -> 5918.30s]  one. It's definitely lower than a nine point nine. You guys remember when I gave the outer wilds an
[5918.30s -> 5937.08s]  eight point nine and everybody said I and everyone hated me for like a week. All right, let's go back
[5937.08s -> 5964.70s]  to the beginning and look how long that took. Just teleport out. I just did. All right. The
[5964.70s -> 5983.43s]  final trial of what's the name of this village? Oh, what is it? Mr. Hero. Hey, are you the hero?
[5983.43s -> 5988.86s]  Could it be? Welcome to Korok Forest. You're much cooler looking than I thought you'd be. Hey,
[5988.86s -> 5993.77s]  thank you. Would be sure you're up to the task. I prepared a trial. What do you think? Will you
[5993.77s -> 6000.01s]  accept my trial? Yes. Show me a rod with the power of ice, please. You can wave this rod
[6000.01s -> 6003.61s]  to freeze monsters in their tracks. Ice wizrobes love to. Oh, I have one of those.
[6004.33s -> 6022.55s]  I have one of those. Look what I got. It's not what he wants. This is an ice rod, isn't it?
[6023.35s -> 6029.16s]  This doesn't count. Is it? Oh, it's the it's the wand. OK, not like it's OK. I thought it had to
[6029.16s -> 6050.65s]  just be like an ice weapon. Let's do the final trial. The little one thing. OK, cool. This game
[6050.65s -> 6057.58s]  is so fun, though. You know what? OK, I'm going to make a I'm going to make an Elden Ring comparison
[6057.58s -> 6060.62s]  because that's what I'm going to do. So I don't want to block your ears right now. Go for it.
[6061.50s -> 6067.54s]  But I like how in Breath of the Wild, there's just a bunch of random shit to do,
[6068.89s -> 6073.69s]  just a bunch of random shit everywhere. And it's not stupid shit.
[6074.49s -> 6079.05s]  There's a lot of big open world games. They they say we got all this stuff to do, right?
[6080.44s -> 6085.80s]  This is like handcrafted stuff to do. Like this is here, right? This is here.
[6086.95s -> 6099.88s]  So they like made this completely unique to this area. It's great. I feel the same way about the
[6099.88s -> 6104.62s]  Elden Ring was the same way where every every single spot, all the missions and all the quest
[6104.62s -> 6109.72s]  felt like somebody's like handmade it. It wasn't just like, oh, we have this thing we can put here
[6109.72s -> 6112.44s]  and this thing we can put here. It was like, oh, no, you're making this area. You're going
[6112.44s -> 6123.56s]  to hand make this area. What's wrong? I told you to stop scaring me. What's what's going on?
[6123.56s -> 6137.64s]  I have to go back. Oh, OK. I'm ready for the trial. Yes, I am. My little Oki just now set
[6137.64s -> 6142.20s]  off to do the trial. Normally I'd go along, too, but Oki insisted on going alone. I'd let
[6142.20s -> 6146.98s]  Oki go. But well, I'm just getting worried. Would you please follow Oki without being seen?
[6146.98s -> 6154.86s]  I want to make sure nothing happens. He's right there. Look over there. So just make sure nothing
[6154.86s -> 6170.94s]  bad happens. This is an escort quest and don't get seen. What are you talking about?
[6171.74s -> 6201.70s]  All right. I have to crouch. I have to crouch. All right. Go on. Do what you're going to do.
[6202.34s -> 6236.41s]  I need like a GTA mission line above his head. When it fills up, I lose. Shit. Where to go?
[6253.03s -> 6322.04s]  Where to go? Where to go? Oh, there you are. Don't I have a stealth thing? Speed, speed. Where's
[6322.04s -> 6370.44s]  stealth? The purple one? Let's eat this. What are you coming over here? Don't look over here.
[6378.30s -> 6382.70s]  You know, escort quests I think could do with a little bit of kind of reimagining.
[6382.70s -> 6388.12s]  How much more fun would this be if it was like, oh, yeah, by the way, he's really reckless.
[6388.12s -> 6393.00s]  And instead of just the walk behind the person, it was they were sprinting through and aggroing
[6393.00s -> 6410.22s]  the entire forest. Like they just aggro everything and it's just chaos. Do you guys
[6411.02s -> 6416.95s]  Warcraft reference? Here it comes. Remember in Warcraft, you do the escort quest and you'd get
[6416.95s -> 6422.87s]  attacked by like five people and the escort would sprint way out of the way to fight.
[6423.43s -> 6427.11s]  And then after the big fight was done, they would run all the way back to where they were
[6427.11s -> 6440.04s]  currently walking from. Hey, they would walk, run all the way back to where they were walking from
[6440.04s -> 6448.17s]  and then start slowly going again. Like the game did not, their AI did not allow them to go further
[6448.81s -> 6460.04s]  unless they were walking the exact path they had to walk. What are you doing? What are you doing?
[6460.60s -> 6488.15s]  Get out of the fucking way. What happened? Hey, what's going on?
[6492.63s -> 6526.92s]  Don't do this to me now. I'm in the middle of something. What are we doing right now?
[6526.92s -> 6568.30s]  It's just a shadow. I'm not fucking around. I don't care if it's too long. Are you turning around?
[6568.30s -> 6571.96s]  What are you doing? Are you walking forward? I can't tell. You're just a blob.
[6596.01s -> 6628.39s]  Don't walk into the fire. Okay. Where'd he go? Where'd he go? Where is he? Where'd he go?
[6628.39s -> 6634.55s]  Where is he? I don't see him. I don't. Where'd he go? I actually don't know where he is.
[6634.55s -> 6638.52s]  Where is he? I don't see him at all. I don't see him. I don't see him. Where is he? Where is he?
[6638.52s -> 6646.47s]  I actually, I'm serious. I don't know where he is. Which way? Which way? Which way? I don't. I can't.
[6646.47s -> 6662.92s]  I'm serious. Where is he? Right? I didn't see where he went. Oh, there he is. I got it. I got it.
[6662.92s -> 6682.26s]  Thank God. All right. Something weird happened here. I made it. Yep, you did.
[6683.93s -> 6708.34s]  Are we good? Can I go and talk to him now? You did it. Nice job. Guess what, Mr. Hero? I did the
[6708.34s -> 6713.50s]  trial by myself. Aren't I brave? You're probably here for the shrine. The great Deku Tree said
[6713.50s -> 6717.26s]  that the monk's blessing is waiting in the shrine ahead. Why don't you go take a look?
[6717.26s -> 6742.57s]  Nice job. You did it. Nice work. You did the trial. I did it. Nice. All right. I did all the forest
[6742.57s -> 6762.44s]  or at least the shrine stuff. Do I get anything for doing all of it? Do you imagine a bomb
[6763.08s -> 6772.38s]  is going, like an explosion goes off next to you? Like, oh, what was that? I didn't have to,
[6772.38s -> 6785.02s]  I just shot an arrow. Ancient core. Cool. Yeah. So what's the, is there a, you did all three trials.
[6785.02s -> 6808.28s]  Do I get anything? Go upgrade your stasis. Is that from the village? Looks like you have plastic
[6808.28s -> 6821.83s]  surgery. I don't know. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? I love how you say this guy, but you've
[6821.83s -> 6828.90s]  been a sub for like three months at least. You know who I am. You know what, you, you're, you're
[6828.90s -> 6843.66s]  here and you, you're here. Hey dude, this guy, you know who I am. You were hanging out here.
[6843.66s -> 6864.26s]  All right, let's turn it in. Celebrity meltdown. Welcome back to celebrity meltdown. Funnyman
[6864.26s -> 6873.82s]  streamer German985 had a little bit of a problem in the lost forest in Breath of the Wild. Could
[6873.82s -> 6881.48s]  not quite figure out that trial. Our sources say that after the stream ended, Mr. Albertson actually
[6881.48s -> 6891.90s]  took a bite out of his drywall and then had to go to the dentist shortly after. All right, what do
[6891.90s -> 6903.53s]  I get? It's only a matter of time before you're able to pull the master sword. Hurry up and show
[6903.53s -> 6908.15s]  us what you got. Ah, I know that look. You want me to give you something since you visited all the
[6908.15s -> 6914.12s]  places, don't you? Yes, I have no choice. I'll give you my treasured item. Big hearty truffle times
[6914.12s -> 6935.34s]  three. Okay. This is like the, this is no omega truffle. Cool. That was fun. I want to go, I need
[6935.34s -> 6944.10s]  to upgrade my health. Is there one of those trying things in this town? I'm going to have to go back
[6944.10s -> 6957.06s]  to the village in the tree. This one inside because I have enough to do. I'll do health.
[6957.06s -> 6978.63s]  They did stamina twice. Where is it? Where is it? Sleep in the bed. Oh, okay. I want to do a heart
[6978.63s -> 7004.70s]  container. Thank you. Cool. Now somebody said you can say I can upgrade the stasis. Where do I do
[7004.70s -> 7011.45s]  that? Have you finished the game? No, not even close. I don't think I'm even at the halfway point.
[7011.45s -> 7022.86s]  I have one guardian down. I'm about to do the second guardian in the lab. That was, where was
[7022.86s -> 7054.17s]  that? Where's that lab? I feel like it was up. Wasn't it up? It's in the bottom. Oh, okay. Still
[7054.17s -> 7077.91s]  think I can't dodge a battle axe after hearing that. All right. Let's go. All right. In here.
[7077.99s -> 7092.31s]  Let's talk to you. Good morning. Did you bring me any ancient materials? Yes. Which rune do you want
[7092.31s -> 7134.90s]  to power up? Stasis. Three ancient cores. Yes. Thank you. Charging your phone. I like this little
[7134.90s -> 7145.70s]  iPad. I like it. Powered up stasis rune can now time stop evil creatures. The stored energy will
[7145.70s -> 7151.98s]  act upon the object when the flow of time. Wait, you can, I can freeze people now? That seems kind
[7151.98s -> 7167.83s]  of good. It seems really good. What's this? Perhaps you already went and powered them all up.
[7168.57s -> 7172.57s]  Suppose your Sheikah slate and your legendary swordsmanship have, we have nothing to fear.
[7173.21s -> 7193.06s]  Nothing at all. Calamity Ganon. All right. So I think I'm going to take a little BRB here.
[7193.94s -> 7201.10s]  There's our couple of hours of Breath of the Wild. Going to move on to, let's hear it. I want
[7201.66s -> 7208.30s]  everyone to say all capitals. What are we moving on to? All capitals. All capitals. Pump everybody
[7208.30s -> 7220.58s]  up. Pump everybody up in the chat. All right. I'm going to be right back. I'm going to pee.
[7220.58s -> 7226.74s]  I have to set up some stuff. We're going to play Gotham Knights. Sponsored. This is the last stream
[7226.74s -> 7232.46s]  of Gotham Knights you'll see that's sponsored for the culmination of the last three days.
[7234.47s -> 7239.19s]  Yeah. Probably play, I did, I do want this to be kind of a shorter stream. I have stuff I need to
[7239.19s -> 7246.55s]  do and I don't want my eyeball to blow out of my right side of my head. So I'll tell you what we're
[7246.55s -> 7257.78s]  going to do after Gotham Knights. What's today? So I will not be live for the next few days.
[7260.97s -> 7278.20s]  The next time you will see me live, we'll be on. This is interesting. Probably I will be live for
[7278.20s -> 7286.63s]  a short stream on the 21st. I'm still streaming. I'll be back on the 25th in the afternoon.
[7288.41s -> 7290.81s]  I'll give you one second. I'll be right back. We're going to play Gotham Knights for a couple
[7290.81s -> 7299.74s]  of hours and I might do some co-op too. Cause then I think WB I think wanted to show the co-op.
[7300.89s -> 7308.15s]  So we'll see. I'm going to take a break. I'll be right back. No one cares about your eyeball.
[7308.15s -> 7315.72s]  I care about my eyeball. I don't want it to break. But yeah, once, um, once I'm back, uh,
[7315.72s -> 7321.08s]  in the last kind of this last kind of area of October, like the 29th, 30th and 31st,
[7321.08s -> 7328.10s]  we're going to do a ton of Halloween shit. So be right back. Give me two, three minutes.
