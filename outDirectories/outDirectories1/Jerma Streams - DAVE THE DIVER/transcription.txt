[19.26s -> 37.66s]  What is going on? How are you doing? Too early? It's a little early. You ever like make a sound
[37.66s -> 41.58s]  and you get caught on your own words? And it makes a sound you've never made before?
[42.38s -> 51.70s]  That is what just happened. Can I refill my coffee? Of course I can. Give me two seconds.
[51.70s -> 225.10s]  Okay, I'm back. Hello. Sorry, it took me so long. I had to sprint really, really fast.
[227.72s -> 235.61s]  Yeah, but the coffee that I have in the fridge, it's like, um, oof. It's like maybe like two or
[235.61s -> 250.58s]  three minute run from here. That would suck. Can I just say, when you think about like big houses
[250.58s -> 259.98s]  or like big places. Oh yeah, 17,000 square foot house. I would never want to live in one of those.
[261.03s -> 285.06s]  Ever. I would think that there were ghosts in every room. No way. Then why do you? Dude, if you
[285.06s -> 290.28s]  have them, if you have room for a bowling alley in your house, I don't want to live there.
[299.54s -> 306.14s]  I appreciate smaller spaces. I think you can do way more with a smaller space. I don't like big
[306.14s -> 315.40s]  spaces. I lose shit. You know, how many times I pace around the living room, just like under my
[315.40s -> 323.40s]  breath going like, where the fuck are they? How is it fucking possible to lose, to lose my wallet
[323.40s -> 329.59s]  again? How is it even possible? I'll pace around. I'll go into the bathroom. Was it in here?
[330.47s -> 338.33s]  It's not even possible. And then, you know, end up finding it in the couch,
[339.56s -> 348.54s]  but imagine that times like 10. It would be so awful. I would have to have 10 or 20 wallets.
[349.18s -> 355.99s]  I'd have to have like 10 phones just in every room. It's a skill issue. Oh, that's wow. Yeah,
[355.99s -> 375.99s]  it is. Absolutely. I love this. Have you, have you been to Greek chicken? They got a new location.
[375.99s -> 391.11s]  Food slaps. I'll check it out if it's up. See, I'm always into new food. Stop bragging about
[391.11s -> 397.11s]  your phones and wallets. I don't have 10 phones in 10 wallets. I'm saying if I lived in a big,
[397.11s -> 403.34s]  huge house, I would need to have like five or 10 different wallets. No, I would have,
[403.34s -> 410.66s]  I would have a landline. I'd have a landline that I know where the phone is at all times.
[410.66s -> 417.10s]  I don't need to think about it. I don't need to. I know I want a landline. So many of us that have
[417.10s -> 427.59s]  so many problems remembering where our phone is. I want to bring the landline back. Anyways,
[427.59s -> 436.30s]  let's talk. We got a few things to go over here. The first one is what we're doing today. Dave,
[436.30s -> 441.91s]  the diver is in 1.0. It's been on the list for a long time. Sorry about the milk voice.
[442.87s -> 453.66s]  Ah, trying to get rid of it with some coffee. So game is really good. I have heard it's very good.
[453.66s -> 457.38s]  I've been told this is right up my alley. I've been told, Jeremy, you got to try this out. You
[457.38s -> 465.06s]  got to check it out. And yeah, it's in 1.0 now. So why not? Let's give it a go. Second important
[465.06s -> 471.11s]  thing is this stream is only going to be for about maybe just about three hours because we're going
[471.11s -> 479.05s]  to raid Connor's stream, Sea Dog. Connor is doing a charity stream today, a charity auction stream,
[480.62s -> 491.38s]  which I have a couple of bundles in. There are two bundles. There is a raffle bundle,
[492.25s -> 500.90s]  and then there is an auction bundle. So you'll have to bear with me here while I explain what
[500.90s -> 508.49s]  they are. The first one, the raffle item, which the Grotto Beast Twitter, obviously I already
[508.49s -> 513.38s]  talked about this, but if you want, but I can give you more details. The raffle item is four
[514.26s -> 523.48s]  of the OG archaeology stream cards, and I believe they're all holographic.
[523.48s -> 534.28s]  So if you remember the archaeology stream, the fake packs that I opened, four of those cards
[535.02s -> 541.78s]  are going to be in this charity raffle. Also, there's going to be a copy of the map.
[541.78s -> 554.73s]  Remember the map prop? They were fake. Yeah, Holly made a ton of those cards here,
[554.73s -> 560.89s]  so we picked out the ones that kind of looked the best, felt the best out of all the ones that were
[560.89s -> 569.42s]  made for the original stream, and each one is from each individual artist, the four original team
[569.42s -> 577.35s]  of the original stream. It's a pretty cool item, but you also get the map too. So that prop map,
[577.35s -> 580.79s]  maybe the one with the grandpa, like, oh, he left me the map, and it was all burnt.
[580.79s -> 585.53s]  We made a copy of that map just in case something happened to the original one,
[586.17s -> 591.35s]  and I've had that here for a couple of years, so you get that too. That's part of the bundle.
[593.05s -> 597.77s]  And it's a raffle too, so this is not the auction item. I know a lot of people were saying like,
[597.77s -> 604.01s]  oh shit, okay, some germamite's going to come in and drop tons of money, and I'm not going to
[604.01s -> 617.34s]  have a chance at all. Well, the raffle is for you then. The auction is two Grotto Beasts
[617.34s -> 626.28s]  holographic test sheets. So they're holographic print sheets that the printer sent us to approve
[626.92s -> 633.86s]  the second print, and I signed both of them. And it's really interesting because the two sheets
[633.86s -> 643.27s]  that are in this auction, their holographics don't exist in the real game. It's a different
[643.27s -> 650.84s]  holographic type that is on these because they were tests, so they don't exist in the regular
[650.84s -> 659.80s]  game. There's also a postcard that we sent to friends and family, so holographic postcard as
[659.80s -> 673.27s]  well. They're holographic testies. They're uncut. Yes, they are uncut sheets. Are you going to auction
[673.27s -> 689.45s]  the ass baseball? Uh, no. That's for me. But those are two different bundles. One's a raffle,
[689.45s -> 695.37s]  one's an auction, and we did it that way because I wanted more people to participate. I wanted
[695.37s -> 701.61s]  more people to see it and be able to, you know, throw, you know, less than five, ten bucks at
[702.41s -> 706.57s]  an item and potentially get it rather than an auction that could go up into the hundreds,
[706.57s -> 711.93s]  if not maybe the thousands. I have no idea what's going to happen, but I think a lot of money is
[711.93s -> 716.17s]  going to get raised. There's a lot of really cool items. Tons of streamers and YouTubers have given
[716.17s -> 728.15s]  stuff, so we'll rate it in a few hours. You sound constipated. I know, I've got my like voice and
[728.15s -> 734.38s]  throat and body. Everything's a little jumbled today, the last few days I'd say. I'm kind of
[734.38s -> 741.08s]  jumbled and having stomach intestinal problems too. I'm all jumbled up. I'll be all right,
[741.08s -> 753.19s]  though. Don't worry. Let's get a little bit more coffee in me. I'll be good. Did he say testicles?
[756.41s -> 768.26s]  It's not a testicle problem, okay? Oh my god. All right, you guys ready to play Dave the Diva?
[770.97s -> 783.66s]  Let's play it. I'm interested. Hey, what's on the agenda today? You're gonna play this one game,
[783.66s -> 789.83s]  you're gonna be playing anything else after? Just this for probably two and a half hours or so,
[789.83s -> 794.55s]  and then I'm gonna dump you all on Connor's stream. I think the, I think one of the items,
[794.55s -> 802.28s]  I think the raffle item, I think is happening pretty early. So, I would, you know, he's stalling?
[802.84s -> 810.86s]  I mean, yeah, very importantly. I'm gonna give you guys some info. Can you shout out my cat? Hey,
[811.58s -> 817.90s]  Mr. Fuzzy! Thanks for watching the stream. You didn't say where your cat's name was,
[817.90s -> 824.06s]  so I just assumed what it was. All right, let's go. This is gonna chill out. I'm gonna play Dave
[824.06s -> 837.26s]  the Diva and then we'll continue. It's Mr. Fuzzy, Mr. Fuzzle, what is it? I didn't see it.
[837.26s -> 848.25s]  That's a valid assumption. Yeah, I think it was. What's the charity? The charity,
[848.81s -> 858.55s]  hold on. Yeah, there's, shit, hold on. Let me, hold on. Give me a second. It's the Immune
[858.55s -> 868.87s]  Deficiency Foundation. Hold on, I gotta write something. Immune Deficiency Foundation. No,
[868.87s -> 881.91s]  I knew what it was. I just, I have to talk to somebody. Give me one second. How do you raffle?
[881.91s -> 904.49s]  Hold on, give me one second. Okay, you don't want a notification, but I can't even talk today. You
[904.49s -> 908.81s]  know when a notification pops up in your phone and it just kind of ruins your entire train of
[908.81s -> 918.47s]  thought? That's what just happened. That doesn't happen to anybody. He had to take a bong rip.
[924.60s -> 935.16s]  That does not happen to anybody else. Come on. All right, let's go. I get distracted incredibly
[935.16s -> 961.05s]  easily. We know. Facecam? No, not today. Not right now. I feel terrible. You know what I mean? Like,
[961.05s -> 966.63s]  this is, this is not facecam days. The last like four or five days, I'd say. These are very much
[966.63s -> 988.55s]  anti-facecam days. Well, terrible is the wrong word. Terrible would imply that I, you know,
[988.55s -> 1002.86s]  I'd feel, I just feel like, ugh. That's the best way to describe it. What about the classic no-cam
[1002.86s -> 1019.19s]  germa era? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Okay, I don't know very much about this game. I just
[1019.19s -> 1028.01s]  know that I wanted to play it. Is this a roguelike? Is this a trinket collector? Is this a, you fight
[1028.01s -> 1052.36s]  stuff? It's a granny-like. I doubt this is a granny-like. What's the last granny-like that
[1052.36s -> 1073.70s]  came out? Hello Neighbor? It's, I don't, Hello Neighbor came out like seven years ago. This has
[1073.70s -> 1087.94s]  definitely been one since then. Oh, Dave, you got here quickly. Hello? Oh, there we go. Well, I was
[1087.94s -> 1094.55s]  told to hurry here. I was on vacation, you know. So where's the sushi at? Don't rush yourself. Have
[1094.55s -> 1101.61s]  a look around. Look at this giant blue hole. I've never seen anything like this. It's not just the
[1101.61s -> 1106.49s]  size. Every time you enter the giant blue hole, the terrain and ecology changes, which means
[1106.97s -> 1113.34s]  this could be an incredible business opportunity. What kind of business? Well, we can discuss that
[1113.34s -> 1118.07s]  later. I heard you took a break from diving. How about warming up? I'll guide you from here. Go
[1118.07s -> 1129.11s]  ahead and go in. I don't have a good feeling about this. Okay. A sushi bar. Try moving with,
[1129.99s -> 1136.47s]  oh, which one is, what is that? I have X, Y, A, and B. Is it a bumper? Left bumper?
[1136.47s -> 1153.05s]  A shitload of you just screamed at the screen. I'm just relaxed. Okay. That was a test. That was a
[1153.05s -> 1170.39s]  test to see how patient you really are. And a lot of you aren't. Move to the marked area. So this is
[1170.39s -> 1192.33s]  like a boost. How's the volume? Good? Okay. The dive knife. Use the dive knife. Ooh, smooth and quick.
[1192.33s -> 1196.92s]  Finally, you haven't forgotten how to use the harpoon, have you? Harpoon? Well, I haven't used
[1196.92s -> 1202.34s]  one in a long time. I came first. It looks like you need some practice. Try the harpoon to catch,
[1202.34s -> 1208.62s]  let's say, three fish. Got a huge announcement, by the way. I have an unbelievably massive
[1208.62s -> 1213.72s]  announcement, and I waited until this many people were here to tell you it. Massive announcement.
[1214.46s -> 1226.55s]  Unbelievably massive. Ladies and gentlemen, the first ever House Flipper Invitational,
[1226.55s -> 1237.96s]  where a bunch of streamers make a house and I have to grade it, is officially on Monday.
[1237.96s -> 1250.15s]  Monday at 4 o'clock Pacific. Time might change, but Monday the 3rd is the House Flipper Invitational.
[1250.15s -> 1255.27s]  Well, that's what I'm calling it. There's no official, nothing official with House Flipper,
[1255.27s -> 1266.07s]  but I think that's going to be a ton of fun. Whoa. Aim with A and press right trigger to fire. Oh,
[1266.07s -> 1278.71s]  I get it. That's sick. I will announce who is going to be in it, probably on Twitter and on
[1278.71s -> 1281.83s]  Discord and everything, and they'll probably talk about it too, but so far I've been reaching
[1281.83s -> 1289.61s]  out to people. So far we've got, we've got a good group so far. And just in case anything comes up
[1289.61s -> 1297.03s]  and the kind of roster changes, I'll wait like another day or two. But yeah, we got some good,
[1297.03s -> 1305.48s]  good people coming up. It's going to be a lot of fun. I'll have different grading criteria.
[1305.48s -> 1314.18s]  Everybody gets, and here, this is actually, here, hear me out. Is 60 minutes, if everybody starts at
[1314.18s -> 1320.74s]  the same time, is his ass has no plan. I got a whole document written. I have 60 minutes.
[1320.74s -> 1324.81s]  Everybody starts at the same time and everybody's graded on five different criteria.
[1324.81s -> 1333.18s]  Do you think 60 minutes is enough time? You're stuttering today. Yeah, I know. I'm a stuttering
[1333.18s -> 1337.50s]  guy. I'm usually like that. And when I don't feel that great, it's like amplified. So you're going
[1337.50s -> 1345.38s]  to get like triple the stutters today. Is 90 better? I feel like 90 was what it was originally,
[1345.38s -> 1351.54s]  but I'm kind of afraid to have it be 90. I feel like 90 might be a little too long.
[1352.42s -> 1360.60s]  The last time when me and Ludwig did this for the bro versus bro, it was 40 minutes and it felt like
[1360.60s -> 1366.60s]  it was okay. It was all right, but I would have liked a little bit more time, but not that much
[1366.60s -> 1378.54s]  more. 75 split the difference. We'll see. But it's somewhere, somewhere between 60 and 90 minutes
[1378.54s -> 1392.10s]  is what it will be. Yeah. Everyone's going to start with the same house and everyone starts at
[1392.10s -> 1396.52s]  the same time. It's going to be like a chopped on food network scenario where it's like, hands up,
[1396.52s -> 1407.08s]  everybody stop. Okay. I got to read this. Hold on. 75 is good. I think we start with 60 and then we
[1407.08s -> 1415.40s]  can add time if we want to. We can do like a, let's veto everything and add 15 minutes, depending.
[1416.04s -> 1421.16s]  Who knows? It could get to a point where we get to 55 minutes or like 45 minutes and everybody's
[1421.16s -> 1429.43s]  just done. Like, oh, okay. Cause I want it to be pressure. They're going to be graded on creativity,
[1430.44s -> 1436.97s]  complexity, cleanliness, structural integrity, philosophy. I've got a whole five point system
[1442.78s -> 1450.33s]  and they have to take me through a tour of the house one by one. Philosophy. Yeah. Oh, by the
[1450.33s -> 1455.62s]  way, and chats grade on, and there's going to be a weighted scale. I put a lot of thought into this.
[1455.62s -> 1461.22s]  I tell you, I've got, I got a whole document with all my things in it. Yeah. Chat will get a grade.
[1467.35s -> 1478.79s]  When are you going to do a twerking competition? All right. Yeah. That's a, that's coming up on
[1478.79s -> 1485.99s]  Monday. Now it's possible that some things need to be changed. This is, you know, I'm going to,
[1485.99s -> 1492.12s]  I'm leaving it up in the air, but July 3rd is the date. Gotta make sure to get everybody at the same
[1492.12s -> 1496.36s]  time. A lot of people have different schedules, trying to get a bunch of people to do it at the
[1496.36s -> 1504.94s]  same time. So I'll give you more info this coming weekend. So just get the ingredients.
[1506.49s -> 1510.17s]  You got it. So I can eat as much sushi as I want. Yeah, sure. You have to pay though.
[1510.73s -> 1532.92s]  Let's check it out. Go sushi. His ass is not reading. Well, I'm reading some of it.
[1539.59s -> 1546.06s]  Okay, let's go. It's already finished. You, you're the fisherman Cobra was talking about.
[1546.06s -> 1549.85s]  Well, I'm more of a diver than a fisherman. All right. Anyway, it's nice to meet you. I'm
[1549.85s -> 1556.65s]  Bansho. So you like sushi? Sure do. Tuna belly, eel, sirloin, oh boy, just think about it makes
[1556.65s -> 1563.82s]  my mind water. Just as mediocre as I expected. Sushi is a food that combines the soul of sea
[1563.82s -> 1568.81s]  and land. It symbolizes mother nature herself. Most people, however, have only tasted more
[1568.81s -> 1574.33s]  accessible fish, just like you. How empty a life is one that ends without ever tasting the beauty
[1574.33s -> 1578.94s]  mother nature can offer. My calling is to bring the taste of mother nature to every...
[1579.74s -> 1599.27s]  What's wrong with those choices? What's wrong with tuna? An earthquake. The interior is really quite
[1599.27s -> 1605.19s]  a mess. Looks like we're gonna have to delay the opening. You know what? Spend all my money
[1605.19s -> 1608.71s]  getting this restaurant ready. I'll have to recover the repair costs though doing business.
[1609.59s -> 1615.06s]  In this state? Well, ha ha ha ha. In the end, the importance of a restaurant is the taste.
[1615.62s -> 1619.64s]  First we need ingredients. Did you bring anything? Well, I have something I just caught.
[1622.15s -> 1626.94s]  Only three fish. This won't be nearly enough to serve the guests. Please go and catch seven
[1626.94s -> 1639.93s]  more fish. The restaurant's gonna be open only in the evening. Okay. What? It's the chef's duty
[1639.93s -> 1644.73s]  to prepare the best possible food with meticulous precision, just as a warrior sharpens his sword
[1644.73s -> 1650.79s]  on a whetstone. You need to get me the best quality ingredients during the day. I can do that.
[1654.30s -> 1663.30s]  People are so mad. Why? Because of my blah ha ha ha? I think every blah ha ha ha that I do,
[1663.30s -> 1673.05s]  I lose like 50 followers. I have to be careful. How many followers do I have? How many times can
[1673.05s -> 1680.49s]  I do blah ha ha and lose 50 people a day before I lose all these followers? I wonder how long
[1680.49s -> 1689.56s]  it would take. It's probably gonna take a while. I'll be all right. I've been seeing
[1689.56s -> 1693.72s]  Banshee so enthusiastic since the incident. Oops, maybe I shouldn't have brought that up.
[1693.72s -> 1701.67s]  Well, anyways, we need more ingredients. Go catch seven fish. Followers plummeting.
[1702.76s -> 1712.23s]  No, no, my followers, my followers. Okay. Make a hundred gold and catch fish. Let's do it.
[1712.23s -> 1720.74s]  You go deeper than your current equipment allows. Your oxygen will flash red and will
[1720.74s -> 1731.80s]  deplete quickly. Okay. Catch fish. Make money. I got it. Does it matter what fish I get?
[1731.80s -> 1752.52s]  This one pyramid butterfly fish. Do I, does the quality go down if I use the harpoon?
[1752.52s -> 1759.42s]  Kind of like a Red Dead Redemption situation. Like am I messing up the quality? No. Okay.
[1759.98s -> 1782.36s]  Nah. All right. Good. Oh, look at these ones. What's that? I can't pick it up. Really?
[1782.36s -> 1807.32s]  Do I need a better harpoon? Oh, you just have to tap it. Okay. You need to weaken them if
[1807.32s -> 1817.42s]  their HP is too high. Okay. So do I, do I have to go up or will it kind of be like,
[1817.42s -> 1821.10s]  Hey, your oxygen is low. It's time to end the day. Or do I have to physically go all the way up
[1821.10s -> 1834.82s]  physically with the character? What is that? Ooh. Okay. The O2 just is the timer. You do not have
[1834.82s -> 1856.07s]  to go up. Okay. So I get to increase time by seeing those on the ground. Got it. I'm gonna
[1856.07s -> 1885.05s]  just only go for these ones. Two times with the harpoon. What's in the pot? Potion? Soy sauce.
[1885.05s -> 1900.97s]  New. Do I have to make recipes or something? What about the giant eel? Can I die? Okay. I
[1900.97s -> 1924.63s]  think I can die. So that's a bad idea. That thing looks rare. Running out of air. Warning. Give me
[1924.63s -> 1930.68s]  this first. All right. Go. Do I have to go up? I thought you guys said I didn't have to go up.
[1930.68s -> 1958.82s]  You said I didn't have to go up. Did one guy do that? Do you still need oxygen? I definitely
[1958.82s -> 1975.72s]  made 100. Prepare sushi ingredients. Ooh. Okay. Biggest fish was that one. Two stars. Cooking
[1975.72s -> 1982.55s]  ingredients? Fish. Two fish tank. Do I have to wrap up your day and get things ready at the
[1982.55s -> 1989.37s]  sushi place? Okay. You can only dive once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Get the
[1989.37s -> 1995.88s]  ingredients ready before the dinner hours start. Isn't it like 10 o'clock at night? What time is
[1995.88s -> 2014.15s]  it? It's late. How about you let me play this game? We'll just go get it. It's on steam right now.
[2014.15s -> 2031.37s]  Okay. Bring ingredients back. Okay. You can check your fish, crops, sauces, and all the other
[2031.37s -> 2035.94s]  materials you have. For now, that's all you need to know. Come back later for more information.
[2035.94s -> 2050.70s]  I have to make a menu? New recipes need to be added to the menu before they can be sold to
[2050.70s -> 2056.58s]  customers. There's a sushi recipe for the fish you acquired earlier, so try registering that
[2056.58s -> 2071.06s]  to the menu. What do we got? Clown fish sushi. What's the most expensive one? Four? Ten? This
[2071.06s -> 2084.94s]  one's ten. Add three. E-clown sushi. Setting ingredients to auto-supply will make things a
[2084.94s -> 2091.32s]  bit more convenient. Let me repeat. Only food on the menu can be sold. If you run out of ingredients,
[2091.32s -> 2100.73s]  you'll have to replace items on the menu or refill the ingredients. You can enhance the flavor with
[2100.73s -> 2115.88s]  the soy sauce. Okay. Just put the most expensive ones on. This one's, this one's nine. I can put
[2115.88s -> 2129.70s]  12 on here. Okay. Spill the whole menu out. Six and then four. Prawns are high. All right. That's
[2129.70s -> 2140.15s]  good, right? Give me a cup of green tea. Have you poured green tea before? No, only soft drinks.
[2140.15s -> 2162.84s]  You only had soda? Is this like Diner Dash? Do I have to do a Diner Dash game? Pour the right amount.
[2162.84s -> 2182.66s]  It kept going. It's good it was the tutorial because that kept pouring. I'm not doing it.
[2182.66s -> 2191.69s]  Wait until the cooking is done. Is there a sprint? Come over to where I am. Take the food.
[2191.69s -> 2214.49s]  Take up the food. You can dash when serving food. Can I drop it? What the hell? The food can't be
[2214.49s -> 2220.84s]  reused with throw it out. It's such a waste. We never reuse food. We do not put food made for
[2220.84s -> 2235.08s]  guests on the table twice. And I just eat it? Don't forget to press Y after filling the menu
[2235.08s -> 2252.78s]  for business to begin. All right. Open the business. What can I get you? Green tea? We got it.
[2252.78s -> 2272.54s]  That's pretty good. All right. What do you want? Who ordered first? I don't remember. I'm already
[2272.54s -> 2294.25s]  out of stamina. Does somebody's leave unhappy? I can only go as fast as he can cook. Anybody need
[2294.25s -> 2313.43s]  tea? Does anybody need any tea? I have to clean. You ordered first, but whatever. This is what
[2313.43s -> 2322.65s]  I'm talking about. Yep. I have negative $52. Wait, what? Oh, right, right, right. Okay. I was going
[2322.65s -> 2350.09s]  to say, what did I do? My service so bad that I have to pay. Not quite there, but in its debt.
[2350.09s -> 2364.41s]  It's debt. All right. $77. So I got to get some better stuff. This game's cool. I like this game.
[2364.41s -> 2378.94s]  You're a bit clumsy, but not bad for a first day. Try a little harder next time. Okay. He likes it.
[2378.94s -> 2398.87s]  What are you doing? All right. This game keeps changing the game that I think it is
[2398.95s -> 2415.05s]  every 10 minutes. There are gigantic monsters. There's a lot to this game, to be honest. Yeah,
[2415.05s -> 2426.70s]  this looks cool. Are you the man who's been diving around here? I think so. I was expecting a more
[2426.70s -> 2433.54s]  professional looking guy. I can hear you. In any case, can you do something for me? Can you tell
[2433.54s -> 2439.06s]  me who you are first? I'm Ellie. I study biology at the local graduate school. I've come out to
[2439.06s -> 2444.66s]  investigate after reports of anomalies in the area. Satisfied? Okay. So what do you want?
[2445.30s -> 2454.41s]  I'd like to study the ecology of this blue hole. Get me some agar and red starfish. I don't think
[2454.41s -> 2461.53s]  it's a good idea to ask for just one of each, so get me two. Your tone makes me want to refuse.
[2462.54s -> 2474.30s]  Got a reward. If you don't want it, that's fine. Reward? This is a side quest I'm imagining, right?
[2474.30s -> 2499.66s]  Okay. Phone. Wait, he's on the boat. A waste of phone fees. Talk to me in person. Throw the
[2499.66s -> 2519.06s]  phone into the ocean. All right. That's, that's cool. Let's go. I get it now. Call them again.
[2521.48s -> 2541.06s]  You definitely don't get it. I, of course I do. Watch. I want to pick up ingredients. All right.
[2541.06s -> 2547.24s]  Only good fish. I don't want, like, look at this is, it's not gonna wow anybody at the restaurant.
[2551.24s -> 2556.12s]  Underwater scooter? Allows you to move quickly underwater. Can't be used once the battery runs
[2556.12s -> 2570.49s]  out. 10 second of battery use? Oh, so it's a, it's a boost. He thinks the big fish equal best fish.
[2570.49s -> 2596.10s]  Early on, I would say that's probably accurate. Sword? Ooh. Does this thing have durability?
[2596.10s -> 2611.43s]  Blue tang? Rainbow rice? Rassy? Ras? What was it? You're wasting oxygen. How do you think
[2611.43s -> 2620.47s]  Peter Griffin would feel about this game? Uh, I'm sorry. Peter Griffin wouldn't play this game.
[2620.47s -> 2627.19s]  Peter Griffin would do a callback reference to when he was the main character of this game.
[2627.19s -> 2635.13s]  You've got your family guy wrong. Oh, it hurts. I don't think sea urchin is gonna be picked up
[2635.13s -> 2649.40s]  with these gloves. Really? He's so mad. I, I'm not picking that up yet. I don't need it yet.
[2649.40s -> 2700.15s]  Ooh, look at these ones. I need those. These are gonna be so expensive. He is seething with rage.
[2700.15s -> 2709.61s]  What's that big one right there? Okay. That, that attacked me. If you exceed your weight limit,
[2709.61s -> 2714.15s]  you will slow down. If you exceed an even higher amount, you won't be able to carry anymore.
[2714.15s -> 2737.62s]  Organize? Overburdened? Uh, what's the shittiest thing I have? This thing's pretty awful,
[2737.62s -> 2746.94s]  but it's the one I just got. Take off. It's the, your oxygen mask. Uh, this thing's like,
[2746.94s -> 2774.36s]  eh, this is just seaweed. Okay. These are two stars. I'm almost there. I, should I go up now?
[2774.36s -> 2796.18s]  9.7, 9.1. Okay. Well, I have to go up. Nice math. I'm learning. I just, I just learned.
[2796.18s -> 2815.26s]  Skulls indicate poison. Let me go back up. I have a full inventory. You're playing it wrong.
[2815.26s -> 2829.54s]  It's the second dive. I got a, I got a trigger fish. Those things are worth millions of
[2829.54s -> 2848.46s]  decimal points. I did notice that the fish in the blue hole have an odd violent streak. Something
[2848.46s -> 2853.26s]  puts them on edge. Speaking of which, why don't you also take a gun in addition to the harpoon?
[2853.66s -> 2866.20s]  A gun. My friend who's knowledgeable about guns. Who's the goofy guy? I'm Dave. I thought divers
[2866.20s -> 2872.44s]  were athletic and muscular. You seem to defy my prior knowledge. People who live in glass houses.
[2872.44s -> 2879.64s]  Oh yeah, that's right. So what's this about? I'd like to get straight to the point. I've begun a
[2879.64s -> 2886.57s]  very interesting business. This guy laughs a lot. And now I'm in need of some weapons. Duff, I need
[2886.57s -> 2892.01s]  your help. Hmm. Season two of The Straw Stella just ended anyway. I'll give you a listen. I
[2892.01s -> 2898.09s]  discovered a fascinating giant blue hole. The terrain and ecology inside, it changes every
[2898.09s -> 2903.64s]  time you go inside. Any equipment found inside breaks down when brought out. I'd like you to
[2903.64s -> 2915.66s]  make us a weapon that can be used inside. Anything that's not made from materials found in the blue
[2915.66s -> 2922.46s]  hole will continue to break down. So it'd be especially true of guns, precision parts. So
[2922.46s -> 2926.70s]  we'll have to get the materials from overseas. I thought that just said from overseas. I was like,
[2926.70s -> 2940.71s]  what? Okay. I need one rope and one scrap iron. You heard him right, Dave. Enter the blue hole and
[2940.71s -> 2948.71s]  bring back rope and scrap iron. If you run out of oxygen midway, you'll only be able to make it
[2948.71s -> 2967.26s]  back with one item. So that's the penalty. Okay. Um, I have to, I have to get rid of stuff. Can I
[2967.26s -> 2970.86s]  store the fish that I have right now? Or should I just bring them over to the menu? Cause I can
[2970.86s -> 2980.65s]  die again. You already did. Oh, so I can go back now. You already did that. Your inventory is auto.
[2980.65s -> 2996.60s]  Okay. I'll go back down. I need rope, iron, sunflower update. We're getting some really good
[2996.68s -> 3003.38s]  pictures. They just started opening as of two or three days ago. The last three or four days,
[3003.38s -> 3012.25s]  I want to say. We have a Hydra. This thing was really healthy and was really, it was fed very
[3012.25s -> 3020.06s]  well apparently. This sunflower, the big one has like eight heads. It's going to be crazy looking.
[3020.06s -> 3028.23s]  All right. Can I pick this up? Starfish. All right. There's that. I need two of those.
[3030.22s -> 3051.00s]  Ow. What? I need a scrap of iron. This is wood. All right. Don't use too much oxygen. I don't know.
[3051.00s -> 3075.74s]  Why is this depth blinking? The depth thing is blinking. Why? I'm too deep. Am I? Am I actually
[3075.74s -> 3089.88s]  too deep? But there's rope down here and wood. All right. I need one more. Where's my, um,
[3089.88s -> 3105.91s]  quest log? I need one more. All right. Go up, go up, go up. I need oxygen. I gotta get out of here.
[3109.83s -> 3116.50s]  Hurry up and get out of here. Shit. I thought I was going to die much quicker than that.
[3116.50s -> 3131.58s]  You have the harpoon. I do have the harpoon. You're right. Basic underwater rifle. Download
[3131.58s -> 3163.14s]  Duff's weapon shop. Only 42 megabytes. What the hell is going on? There was a missed opportunity
[3163.14s -> 3170.31s]  there. I feel like this is the character that would say exquisite. This is exquisite, right?
[3170.31s -> 3187.77s]  So this replaces the harpoon, I'm going to imagine. I can open a weapon chest.
[3192.63s -> 3206.42s]  Blueprints. So if I make it with a blueprint, they won't break down underwater.
[3206.42s -> 3211.90s]  Nice. I hope that when you're 50, you look back at what you said and cringe.
[3212.63s -> 3218.31s]  Ball fondler. Why are there like three of you now? I just read another, I've read a ball fondler
[3218.31s -> 3223.19s]  comment 10, 20 minutes ago. It was a different, it was a different account. Why are there like five
[3223.19s -> 3235.42s]  of you? I'm so confused. It's not the same person. It's a different account. These are fake accounts.
[3235.42s -> 3243.75s]  We'll just ban them all. Do we just ban any type? If you, if your name has ball fondler in it,
[3243.75s -> 3252.17s]  like you're just gone. It's just like, just not allowed on this stream. That's funny.
[3253.77s -> 3267.66s]  Everyone but the OG gets banned. That's funny. Somebody said, stop giving attention to these
[3267.66s -> 3277.80s]  people. Yeah. You know what? That's also right. That's also a correct statement too. Okay.
[3277.80s -> 3295.67s]  You can craft weapons now. All right. Wrap up the day and let's go. Yeah. Let's go do it.
[3295.67s -> 3310.30s]  Ban the false fondlers. I did nothing good, sir. Yeah. Yeah. That's debatable. That's debatable,
[3310.30s -> 3321.62s]  but no. Okay. All right. Who with a high taste score will increase customer satisfaction. He's
[3321.62s -> 3331.30s]  innocent. All right. Let me check the menu. What can I do? Level one. I can enhance it. Hold on.
[3331.30s -> 3342.78s]  What's the most expensive thing I have Mediterranean parrot fish and I can make it better with what do
[3342.78s -> 3351.50s]  I have? How do I make it better? Do I have to pay? But I have to give fish to make it better. What
[3351.50s -> 3369.59s]  am I losing by doing this? I'm losing three fish VIP ball fondler. So you know who the real one is.
[3369.59s -> 3373.99s]  I don't want to VIP ball fondler. I feel like that would all of a sudden ball fondler would
[3373.99s -> 3382.20s]  have like a massive ego trip. I think. No, that's not happening. I think we would get ball fondler
[3382.20s -> 3390.50s]  being like, do you know who I am type of scenarios? We're not having that here. It says Mr. Ego.
[3390.50s -> 3412.66s]  This is my channel. This is my stream. It says Mr. Ego. That's so funny. Do you have any idea
[3412.66s -> 3425.22s]  who he is? Yeah. I know who he is. This one can be enhanced. All right. I only have one of these.
[3425.22s -> 3446.62s]  So let's do the expensive items first. I only have one. These are, these are all right. Wait,
[3446.62s -> 3463.00s]  is this going to kill somebody? You guys said this was poisonous. Whatever. You only have four
[3463.00s -> 3471.50s]  sushi for sale. Well, I'm just trying to get to a hundred bucks. I'll be all right. Green tea. I
[3471.50s -> 3491.32s]  got you right here. Almost perfect for. Oh yeah. Okay. Now I know that that's the fake one. That's
[3491.32s -> 3496.84s]  okay. Now I know that's the fake one. A ball fondler account just said, Hey, give me 20 bucks.
[3496.84s -> 3513.75s]  All right. That's now I know you're absolutely not the real one. Somebody said, I want 20 bucks too.
[3517.80s -> 3558.22s]  Oh man. Yeah. Please be careful. Me too. Me too. I wanted to don't get tricked by any fake ball
[3558.22s -> 3563.72s]  fondler accounts, please. Or even from the real one. Don't you know what I'm saying? Like just be
[3563.72s -> 3594.44s]  diligent. 55. He tricked you into a six month of one guy, but it was all right. You can't deny
[3594.52s -> 3603.34s]  that the original ball fondler arc was not really funny. You can't deny that. It was.
[3603.34s -> 3622.12s]  Nobody can deny that. Okay. So we did the repair. I'm Dr. Bacon. I'm an archaeologist who studies
[3622.12s -> 3627.48s]  the sea people civilization, the sea people. I'll explain it to you. Aren't you lucky to have an
[3627.48s -> 3651.91s]  expert like me tell you about it? Okay. They worshiped fish and had gills allowing them to
[3651.91s -> 3655.75s]  live underwater. They live in the depths, allowing them to flourish without any concern for invasions
[3655.75s -> 3660.41s]  by other civilizations. The sudden changes to the sea bottom brought about their abrupt downfall.
[3660.97s -> 3668.94s]  About all there is. Everyone thinks it's a myth and nothing more, of course. The proof that they
[3668.94s -> 3679.53s]  were real was found right in the vicinity of this place. An amazing find. A lot of people want me
[3679.53s -> 3685.05s]  to do a lot of different things here. Okay. My assistant closely analyzed an artifact found
[3685.05s -> 3690.70s]  nearby and found that it is from no known civilization. It's dated to around 1500 years
[3690.70s -> 3697.32s]  ago as well. There were no civilizations in these parts back then. That's interesting. What business
[3697.32s -> 3703.26s]  do you have with me? Well, you see, my assistant's cryptocurrency investments didn't pan out and he
[3703.26s -> 3709.43s]  won't be around for a good while. That's why I'd like you to help me. My assistant told me that
[3709.43s -> 3716.10s]  the artifact was found 70 meters or so below the surface. Please go take a look. We're busy with the
[3716.10s -> 3721.88s]  sushi bar. I don't think we can. Sorry to interrupt the conversation. I'm Cobra. I work with Dave.
[3722.44s -> 3728.44s]  Of course we should help you. We'll gladly do so. What? We don't have time for this.
[3728.44s -> 3733.10s]  Swim around. Look for artifacts. Think about it. If an underwater civilization is discovered,
[3733.10s -> 3739.94s]  countless people will flock here. Bancho sushi will be bursting at the seams. What was that?
[3739.94s -> 3745.38s]  You have a point. All right, I'll help. Isn't that lucky? Of course. I won't be asking you to work
[3745.38s -> 3751.34s]  for free. I'll upgrade the diving suit you're wearing for free. With an enhanced diving suit,
[3751.34s -> 3756.95s]  you'll be able to venture deeper. This is essential for exploration. These days,
[3756.95s -> 3762.23s]  even such things can be handled by an app. Technological advancements are amazing, eh?
[3762.87s -> 3766.02s]  Let's first install the iDiver app on the phone before we proceed.
[3767.14s -> 3783.10s]  Okay, so you can upgrade. I love upgrades. I have a question for the chat. I love upgrades.
[3784.06s -> 3792.22s]  If there's a game where the oxygen tank is level one and you can get it to level 20,
[3795.06s -> 3804.38s]  what is the best one that I have not played? That's not a question. You had needed to wait
[3804.38s -> 3814.81s]  for two or three sentences to come up. What is like an unbelievable upgrade game? People say in
[3814.81s -> 3822.33s]  Subnautica. Really? I feel like I played Subnautica. Is that like an upgrade game? I love upgrades,
[3822.73s -> 3842.36s]  just to start timing these people up permanently for one minute. Upgrades! Upgrades! You all love
[3842.36s -> 3849.08s]  upgrades. These games sell like crazy and it's because you like to see the number go a little
[3849.08s -> 3868.44s]  higher every few minutes. I still need that starfish. Stardew Valley. Yeah, Stardew Valley. I've
[3868.44s -> 3886.70s]  played it a lot though. What's this one? Uh, idle games? Yeah, I've played a lot of them.
[3886.70s -> 3897.69s]  Factorio. I feel like I'm not smart enough to play Factorio. Factorio to me just kind of seemed
[3898.65s -> 3909.86s]  this is a lot of information that I don't know. Graveyard Keeper has a lot. I'm dumb as bricks
[3909.86s -> 3923.77s]  and it's fun. Maybe I'll check it out. The game you are playing right now, dude. All right,
[3923.77s -> 3933.99s]  I'm into it. Hey guys, give me like a good game that has a bunch of upgrades and it's like really
[3933.99s -> 3940.09s]  fun. It's like tons of stuff to do and good things to collect. Yeah, I think I don't think
[3940.09s -> 3945.10s]  I'll play this game again. What I'm playing right now. Yeah, I'm maybe like I'll try it like later.
[3945.82s -> 3955.96s]  It's like it's this one. All right, wait, what did I just get? Basic rifle, triple axle. This is worse
[3955.96s -> 3973.98s]  than what I have on. Metroid. Oh, sorry. I've been sitting here silently. So how does it work? Oh,
[3973.98s -> 4002.17s]  it's a gun. So wait, do I just, how much are these worth? If I, yeah, yeah, yeah. It is like Red Dead,
[4002.17s -> 4026.55s]  isn't it? This is definitely like Red Dead. I can destroy the meat, right? 100%. I need one of those
[4026.55s -> 4041.02s]  tanks. What's this? Ammo box. Orange juice just went up my nose. Stop making me laugh. Wait, you
[4041.02s -> 4072.15s]  just, you just distracted me and got me. You know, hold on. I'm gonna die. Swimming fat. I can't get
[4072.15s -> 4092.10s]  the pot right now. Try Ilona. You actually brought them back. I guess I expected too little of you.
[4092.10s -> 4100.89s]  This should do for now. Here's a reward. $70. Five olive oils and five soy sauce.
[4109.00s -> 4117.62s]  Animal Crossing is that game. Yeah, I have a really shit take that all of you are going to be mad
[4117.62s -> 4126.34s]  about, but I just, I have a lot of trouble getting into Animal Crossing because every time I've ever
[4126.34s -> 4133.46s]  played Animal, I play it at like two o'clock in the morning every single time and it works on real time.
[4134.34s -> 4138.90s]  So when I'm lying in bed, it's like, oh yeah, let me check on Animal Crossing. It's like 2 a.m.
[4138.90s -> 4145.70s]  every day. It's just like, I can't really even do anything. And then it's like, well, just change
[4145.70s -> 4151.22s]  the clock on your Wii or on your Switch. And it's like, I don't want to, I don't want to do that.
[4152.02s -> 4157.22s]  I don't want to go into my settings and change the clock a day forward, go back out of the menu,
[4157.22s -> 4165.02s]  go back into the game, reset the game and no, that is the solution. But then I forget about that and
[4165.02s -> 4181.86s]  it'll be like December, not time traveling. I would love an Animal Crossing, like Animal Crossing,
[4181.86s -> 4188.28s]  I would love an Animal Crossing colon game. Do you know what I mean? Like Animal Crossing colon,
[4188.28s -> 4195.11s]  let's get to it. And it's just, there's no time stuff. It's just, it's not like a main
[4195.11s -> 4204.36s]  Animal Crossing game. You know what I'm saying? Animal Crossing colon, up and at them. And that,
[4204.36s -> 4207.88s]  they call it that. And it has the colon because it's a different game.
[4211.98s -> 4216.30s]  You guys don't know, you guys make fun of me for grammar. You guys don't, I'm a colon, semi-colon,
[4216.30s -> 4232.54s]  colon. Okay. You can decorate. That's cool. Animal Crossing colon, New Horizons.
[4235.69s -> 4242.02s]  They all have colons, don't they? Do they all have colons? Is it Animal Crossing colon?
[4243.80s -> 4247.48s]  What are they all? They have to be, right? Animal Crossing colon,
[4248.92s -> 4253.16s]  new leaf or something, right? Animal Crossing colon, New Horizons, Animal Crossing colon.
[4257.77s -> 4277.29s]  It's okay. That shows you how much I've played those games. When was the last time that they,
[4278.17s -> 4292.14s]  have they ever numbered Animal Crossing? No. Social media app? No, that would be silly.
[4298.66s -> 4306.17s]  I love the theory of Animal Crossing. It's a wonderful theory, but for me, I'm just so,
[4306.17s -> 4312.97s]  I play every game on my own time, not on stream after like 12 o'clock every day, midnight.
[4317.22s -> 4324.01s]  And then I'll look up stuff about, oh yeah, well, as long as you play
[4324.57s -> 4331.37s]  at 9 AM, this bug exists. And it's like, I, the first thing I do at 9 AM, I'm going to forget,
[4331.37s -> 4335.30s]  I'm not going to wake up and play Animal Crossing. I'm going to forget about that.
[4343.74s -> 4351.42s]  Ever since the Zoom beanies stream, I get mid-roll ads. Uh, you shouldn't be. I mean,
[4351.42s -> 4358.22s]  I'm not running them. Oh wait, hold on a second. Oh shit. I think you did probably get caught in the,
[4358.94s -> 4368.97s]  I did run an ad when I was like fucking with everybody. Um, apologize about that. Yeah.
[4369.53s -> 4374.41s]  It's possible that you joined right. And that right when I was doing that stupid, like,
[4374.41s -> 4380.62s]  please play ad joke thing. Cause I think that's when I did that. But if that's not the case,
[4380.62s -> 4389.08s]  then I don't know. I'm not running them here. Hey, more customers will visit new foods would
[4389.08s -> 4419.08s]  be unlocked. 65, 65. I'll keep the one I have. All right. Now I got to go into the app and post
[4419.08s -> 4435.58s]  about the restaurant. I got to give it a like. Oh, I can do this. Rank up followers. I need 10
[4435.58s -> 4467.62s]  followers. Should I just go through and like everything? Let's get the menu gone. I don't
[4467.62s -> 4476.87s]  know how to use social media. I just don't do it. I know how to use it, but I just don't.
[4483.21s -> 4491.58s]  I got three mid roll ads on the next best stream and one on this. I don't know what they're doing.
[4494.82s -> 4500.76s]  Yeah. I'm I'll look in my dashboard and make sure I, cause I'm unless that's like automatically
[4500.76s -> 4524.20s]  happening. It shouldn't be. All right. Menu 20 bucks, 20 bucks. I got two of these now open.
[4524.20s -> 4532.84s]  What is this ingredients? Oh, I can sell these just as they are. That's cool.
[4536.98s -> 4551.43s]  Oh, cause you open at night. Should I sell some of this? Might as well. Just the stuff I'm not
[4551.43s -> 4567.91s]  using. I'm not going to sell the condiments or anything though. Stop, stop, stop, stop,
[4568.47s -> 4586.97s]  stop. Don't sell. Don't sell. Don't sell. That actually a bad idea. Okay. Do you like the beach?
[4586.97s -> 4590.01s]  I do. I haven't been in a long time though, cause obviously where I live.
[4598.62s -> 4606.79s]  I'm going to try to go down deep. I'm not picking up any boxes or anything. It's all a beach where
[4606.79s -> 4650.86s]  you live. Well, I mean, beach implies water. There is no water. Dolphin. Follow it. I'm not going to
[4650.86s -> 4679.16s]  shoot the dolphin with the harpoon for relax. A pink dolphin is caught in the net. You guys have
[4679.16s -> 4709.58s]  money. That's the noise I was waiting for that. I was waiting for that. A gift. Pearl. All right.
[4709.58s -> 4726.81s]  I got to go down to 70 meters. Wait, this is a, this is better. Yeah. Cause they don't, it doesn't
[4726.81s -> 4733.75s]  mess up the meter or anything. All right. Let's try that. Let me see. Oh, that's a great job.
[4733.75s -> 4753.90s]  All right. Pick it up. How do I pick it up? There we go. Oh, this is a three star. I wonder,
[4753.90s -> 4773.54s]  is this fish expensive? Underwater scooter. That's actually good to have right now. All right. I'm
[4773.54s -> 4784.71s]  going to just try to go fast to the bottom. You need to get to 70. Uh, I have to go back up.
[4784.71s -> 4818.47s]  Escape pod, escape pod. Let me get these fish here. Really drowning. I have 25. I'm all right
[4818.47s -> 4832.79s]  for now. This is an escape pod. Wait, this is not an escape pod. Okay. All right. All right. Right.
[4832.79s -> 4859.24s]  Right. All right. I could have stayed down there a little longer. Okay. It's already evening. I feel
[4859.32s -> 4868.65s]  stiff. All right. I have a lot of materials. Play Assassin's Creed Black Flag. I made a video on
[4868.65s -> 4879.91s]  Assassin's Creed Black Flag like seven years ago. I don't know how good the video is, but I made it.
[4879.91s -> 4895.82s]  I don't really remember. It got an update. This is a food critic. This place is getting
[4895.82s -> 4902.18s]  popular on cook stuff. The name gave me pause, but to think it's really your place. New food
[4902.18s -> 4907.75s]  using ever-before-seen ingredients. Can't taste this anywhere else. Did they mention me too?
[4908.57s -> 4915.30s]  No, not really. Brings you all the way here. Want to check out the restaurant. Looks like
[4915.30s -> 4921.45s]  you're still the same. Okay. You refused to listen to me last time in a similar fashion,
[4921.45s -> 4929.06s]  and that's what got you booted from the hotel. Talking about that again. It's the customer's
[4929.06s -> 4936.31s]  fault for judging the food without even trying it. Who was the shit character from the Black Flag
[4936.31s -> 4950.62s]  video that ended up in the rumble? I, wait, you're pulling out a memory here. I don't know. Those of
[4950.62s -> 4957.11s]  that don't know, there was a tradition on this channel on YouTube and on Twitch up until pretty
[4957.11s -> 4963.85s]  recently where I would, over the course of a year, every character that was kind of meaningful
[4964.49s -> 4970.09s]  in any game or any kind of joke, they would all fight in a rumble at the end of the year.
[4974.14s -> 4980.68s]  And sometimes those characters, it'd be like 20, 30, 40 of them sometimes. And it was like,
[4980.68s -> 4987.05s]  I always wanted a lot. So it's like, wait, who can I even, who could I even have pull from? What
[4987.05s -> 4992.09s]  game did I play this last year? And sometimes you had to dig pretty deep. And that's how you get
[4992.09s -> 4996.89s]  like the random captain from Assassin's Creed Black Flag. It's like, oh, I guess that guy,
[4996.89s -> 5001.86s]  like somebody thought that guy was funny for a minute. So sometimes you have to really dig deep,
[5001.86s -> 5014.95s]  find characters for the rumble, but they're always fun. Every serpent. Yeah, that was the,
[5014.95s -> 5022.12s]  that was the filler arc for the rumble, I think was all seven serpents from,
[5024.55s -> 5030.18s]  when sorcery, when I first did sorcery, half of the entire roster of the rumble was sorcery
[5030.18s -> 5036.76s]  characters. So many, I think it was a half the rumble and then all the planets. Yeah,
[5036.76s -> 5044.04s]  I had to dig deep on that one. You're just not going to do them ever again.
[5045.40s -> 5054.17s]  No, I think what happened was the games got kind of like, like the 2K games,
[5054.17s -> 5060.49s]  it had like this crazy creation suite back in like the early 2010s into the mid 2010s.
[5060.49s -> 5069.51s]  And then it just kind of became less like goofy and more kind of simulation based. And it's just
[5069.51s -> 5074.79s]  like, okay. And then after a while, you kind of you've done it enough times, you kind of the same
[5074.79s -> 5078.95s]  joke, start repeating over and over again. It's like, all right, that was fun. It needs to be
[5078.95s -> 5093.72s]  fresh for me to want to do it again, I think. What about the live rumble? Yeah, that's, that's been
[5093.72s -> 5101.70s]  floating around for a long time. It has been floating around for years at this point, besides
[5101.70s -> 5109.29s]  the one that I did on YouTube. I'll find a way to make it fresh. And the, the wrestling,
[5109.29s -> 5122.65s]  wrestling empire was sort of just like fun to play and mess around in. Okay, please get me a
[5122.65s -> 5145.86s]  white tip reef shark head and olive oil. Shark? Okay, get a shark head and need a gun. I already
[5145.86s -> 5157.46s]  have one, don't I? Sometimes special customers with a backstory will hear of the sushi bar and
[5157.46s -> 5167.16s]  visit. Learn dishes that the customers want through research and serve them to the customers, okay.
[5167.16s -> 5185.54s]  You can now research new recipes. Use the artisan's flame. Artisan's flame research.
[5186.10s -> 5195.03s]  The head of a white reef shark that's been deep fried whole. I only have eight of these.
[5205.82s -> 5238.95s]  53. Geez, okay. What's the menu look like? Looks pretty good. What can I get here today? I don't
[5238.95s -> 5247.11s]  have a shark head. Didn't you just watch us talk about how I don't have that? I thought you were
[5247.11s -> 5279.82s]  a vegan furry. I'm leaving. Perfect four, watch this. Perfect four, watch this. Vegan furry.
[5280.38s -> 5285.29s]  What was that again? I misread what somebody wrote in the chat. I don't remember.
[5285.29s -> 5309.91s]  I'd like to come again. Nice. Somebody said very funny. Ah, that's what it was. Very funny. Yeah,
[5309.91s -> 5314.63s]  I got kind of like all twisted up about it. I was like, what are you talking about? Like,
[5314.63s -> 5318.30s]  what the fuck are you talking about? Why are you saying that to me? And they were just giving me
[5318.30s -> 5354.26s]  a compliment. How do I misread it so much? Chat moves really fast, okay. There's a new post?
[5354.82s -> 5364.36s]  Should I make a post? I don't know. Do I really? I don't want to be the guy that likes every single
[5364.36s -> 5374.17s]  post from everyone, right? Or do I? You know why I don't like to be that guy? Why I don't want to
[5374.17s -> 5380.04s]  be that guy? Because if you don't do it, if I didn't, like let's say Glenn came in and I didn't do
[5380.04s -> 5383.88s]  it to Glenn. Like I just didn't do it one day, but I did it for everyone else. That kind of makes me
[5383.88s -> 5391.86s]  look like a shithead, doesn't it? Like, oh, why didn't they like my post? I saw you liked Luna's
[5391.86s -> 5403.38s]  post and CCJY's post and Rose Pink post, but you didn't, you didn't like mine. That's overthinking
[5403.38s -> 5413.30s]  it. I don't think so. Overthinking social media. Social media is a fucked up place. What do you
[5413.30s -> 5428.46s]  mean overthinking social media? Wait, do these people? All right, let's just call Dr. Bacon.
[5428.46s -> 5452.42s]  Do you have the mini game app? Where's the mini game app? What? I don't have any games. Wait,
[5452.42s -> 5465.10s]  where is my? Oh, there it is. Okay. I definitely want this. Cargo box. I think that's what I want
[5465.10s -> 5486.33s]  first. Upgrades, upgrades. I'd love upgrades. Dr. Bacon is my goat. What would you do if the
[5486.33s -> 5501.45s]  internet disappeared? Find something else to fucking do. I need to go down to 70 meters. I
[5501.45s -> 5516.68s]  keep not doing this. Goofy hammer? Rubber toy hammer. It doesn't do much damage, but
[5516.68s -> 5532.57s]  sometimes I put him to sleep. Whoa. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[5532.57s -> 5537.90s]  Leave me the fuck alone. I need to pick this thing up. What's going on? You piece of shit.
[5537.90s -> 5552.42s]  I cannot believe what just happened. Leave me alone. What do you mean? No. What? I can't pick
[5552.42s -> 5574.73s]  it up. Gold or something. What is this? Dinosaur bones? All right. I'm almost at 70. There's
[5574.73s -> 5620.71s]  oxygen right here. Holy shit. I got lead. Should I be touching this? Okay. We're good. All right.
[5620.71s -> 5654.94s]  I got to go down to 70 and look for artifacts. This might be one right here. Text in my mother
[5654.94s -> 5662.74s]  and I'm done. All right. I'm ready to go. What was that just now? To go back to the boat. What?
[5670.52s -> 5679.26s]  Is that? He thinks he's a funny guy. Well, I need to get rid of it. Should I attack this? I have a
[5679.26s -> 5739.94s]  gun. There's some weird animals in the ocean. I got to get some ingredients. What's that? What's
[5739.94s -> 5751.40s]  that? All right. I got to go now. Get the big one. I can't. I need like a submarine or something.
[5765.77s -> 5791.43s]  You can just kill the big one. What's your Twitch? Twitch.tv slash. So what do I unlock for this?
[5791.43s -> 5799.78s]  Okay. I'll be in touch. Can you link your Twitch? I don't know how to do that though.
[5800.10s -> 5814.33s]  I think there's like a way to copy text and paste it. Magic. All right. I think I have enough.
[5819.83s -> 5831.75s]  New character. Hopity hop. You do know a lot about this giant blue hole. Okay.
[5832.87s -> 5842.14s]  Is the best place to collect? Marinka? Marinka. Trading cards. Marinka.
[5846.78s -> 5850.14s]  Uteristic trading cards that utilize an AI recognition system that automatically
[5850.14s -> 5857.80s]  corresponds to fish in real life. Never heard of it. You seem quite behind. Let me help you
[5857.80s -> 5864.68s]  install the app. Do this. Do this. Do this. Done. Done. All right. All right. You don't really need
[5864.68s -> 5868.84s]  to do anything special. Just catch a new fish and you'll get a card. Check the cards every now and
[5868.84s -> 5876.14s]  then on the app and you're done. Okay. You don't want to be saying the name. I understand. I'll
[5876.14s -> 5894.09s]  try it out. I'm Sato. All right. Cool. Marine cards. Fancy your cards for catching higher grade fish.
[5894.09s -> 5908.94s]  I got a lot of money. I'm going to upgrade the gun because look at how much more damage that is.
[5908.94s -> 5939.08s]  It's ridiculous. I used all my money but it was worth it. I love upgrades. I really do. So what's
[5939.08s -> 5952.31s]  an expensive fish of these? I guess I could just look. I should just get as many as I can really.
[5952.31s -> 5972.65s]  What about a seahorse? I don't want to kill the seahorse. Is that weird? Oh I can't even.
[5972.65s -> 6011.96s]  There we go. These are expensive. Iron. These red fish they have a lot of utilization. Damn it.
[6011.96s -> 6041.94s]  Damn it. I'm playing with a controller so that's my excuse. Oxygen capsule. That's helpful.
[6048.39s -> 6065.10s]  Lightning harpoon. Harpoon tip charged with high voltage. Chain damage. Does that not work? Whoa
[6065.10s -> 6090.84s]  what's happening? Whoa. This must be shocking things around. Oh hold on. I'm running out of uh
[6090.84s -> 6122.78s]  I gotta go up. Will I keep this oxygen capsule till later if I can make it all the way up? What
[6122.78s -> 6148.34s]  do I have to get rid of? I don't want rope. This thing is I mean it's all right. It weighs a lot.
[6148.42s -> 6189.78s]  Eh whatever. What if you sneeze underwater like this? Excuse me. Yes it was real. I should make
[6189.78s -> 6220.14s]  some good money. This dude just sneezed for attention. That's a wild sentence. That is an
[6220.14s -> 6248.74s]  insane sentence. Level three. Let's upgrade. Pretty much upgrade everything. Upgrade again.
[6248.74s -> 6300.94s]  Upgrade everything. What is omega lull? It means happy birthday. It's usually somebody's birthday.
[6300.94s -> 6314.15s]  They're saying happy birthday too. A lot of birthdays today. You really had to dig for that
[6314.15s -> 6327.37s]  one. It's a um it means uh it means uh happy birthday. See there would be a cut there. This
[6327.37s -> 6339.51s]  is live. We're live. It would be like what's omega lull? Well happy birthday. He just didn't get the
[6339.51s -> 6387.56s]  audio cut and that's all right. That tea is chunky. Yeah it is. Lean quick. How's the progress on the
[6387.56s -> 6420.46s]  video you're making? Steady. Steady. We got new food. Kitchen staff. Is this video 10 years in
[6420.46s -> 6437.03s]  the making? Not really. When it comes out you'll know but we'll do a premiere. I made a lot more
[6437.03s -> 6449.19s]  money today. Can you do an impression of German985? I could try. I don't know him that well but let me
[6449.19s -> 6458.54s]  see. Hey I mean what about the aliens? Just aliens? How do we even tell the aliens that we're people?
[6458.54s -> 6470.07s]  How can we possibly describe electricity to the aliens? He kind of talks like that doesn't he?
[6470.07s -> 6481.94s]  That's not bad. He's not really close. I don't fucking know the guy. You're acting like I know
[6481.94s -> 6489.21s]  this guy. One off the cuff message from chat and I'm just trying to... I don't know this person.
[6490.94s -> 6511.24s]  Oh I got a radar. Your voice wasn't nasally enough? Nasally? Do I have a nasally voice? No I don't do
[6511.24s -> 6521.27s]  I? My voice is not nasally. Nasally. You mean nasally like this? Like that? Like this? I don't
[6521.27s -> 6545.19s]  have a nasally voice. How do we tell him? Let's test the radar. His voice is way milkier than that.
[6546.89s -> 6574.98s]  I know. I agree. He doesn't have... he didn't do the velvety buttery voice that he had. Buttery. I don't
[6574.98s -> 6585.40s]  like when voices are described as buttery. He's like stop. He's got a smooth buttery voice. Butter?
[6585.40s -> 6591.66s]  I only want it on fucking toast. Stop. Everywhere else. Unless it's like for you know obviously
[6591.66s -> 6622.57s]  just don't make butter a description for talking is what I mean. Oh the dolphin again. Again? Pirates
[6622.57s -> 6635.77s]  must have captured it illegally. Somebody just shot me with a gun. Who just shot me? Some people
[6635.77s -> 6677.66s]  are shooting at me. They'll shoot back. What's up bro? Oh I can't. Fuck you. Fuck you. What did you
[6677.66s -> 6699.85s]  say? Morgan Freeman voice. I wish I could have it on repeat. It's always the same thing.
[6704.25s -> 6710.33s]  I could probably speak dolphin. If you put me with some dolphins and I was just like
[6712.95s -> 6722.94s]  I would get viciously fucking murdered and it would rip out my eyes and eat all my organs and shit.
[6722.94s -> 6752.52s]  Gold bar. That's pretty huge. I want to find something new. This is kind of new. Have I had
[6752.52s -> 6780.09s]  a pinkfish before? A sea goldie. Can you make a real dolphin noise? Blueprint. Nice. That's a big
[6780.09s -> 6792.60s]  deal. I need to get a shark. How deep do I have to go for a shark? Nice. All right find a shark.
[6792.60s -> 6832.63s]  That's not a shark is it? No. That's a salmon. These things have a lot of health. Hey salmon
[6833.19s -> 6862.47s]  mackerel. Don't bite me. I thought it was gonna bite me. Well now I want that. Give me this. Indeed
[6862.47s -> 6876.50s]  this is my award-winning restaurant. My accolades. All right I gotta go up. Not before I pick up this
[6876.50s -> 6900.73s]  though. Why is he doing the pac-man confused thing from the pac-man game? Look. Look. I can't drop
[6900.73s -> 6946.10s]  anything. I just gotta go. Dave is going to die. Dave is gonna be fine. You're in the ocean?
[6946.10s -> 6960.50s]  Pirates? Sharks usually are near the surface. I'll check it out after this. What is that pac-man
[6960.50s -> 6966.02s]  game called? That's right. Pac-man like the new adventures or something right? Super Nintendo is
[6966.02s -> 6978.04s]  a side scrolling game. It was bizarre. It's a game where you had to tell pac-man to go you had to
[6978.04s -> 6986.33s]  control him with voice commands from a narrator and he was just sort of this weird childlike wonder
[6986.33s -> 6994.60s]  where he would walk around just look at stuff and he would get really distracted. Be like pac-man go
[6994.60s -> 7000.04s]  right and he would just be like and he would just go look at a butterfly. It was a really bizarre
[7000.04s -> 7006.09s]  game. I made a video on it but maybe one day I would stream it because it's so strange. I feel
[7006.09s -> 7026.31s]  like everyone needs to see it. Okay looking for a shark. I have a gun. Check the right side is what
[7026.31s -> 7054.33s]  people were saying. I couldn't swim down to what the radar is pointing me to. Uh that's way better.
[7054.33s -> 7078.46s]  It was from your what the fuck series. Pretty good one. It's copper? Okay cool. These are heavy
[7078.46s -> 7110.34s]  though. I don't want it. All right where's this shark? Olive oil. How long can you hold your breath?
[7110.34s -> 7130.04s]  Um probably not as short as you think. Two seconds. I mean I don't really care to try.
[7130.04s -> 7146.42s]  What's the average? What's the average? Average you know adult male that whatever what's like the
[7146.42s -> 7170.74s]  average? 30 you know let's say 35 year old. One to two minutes. This thing looks kind of this
[7170.74s -> 7182.78s]  thing's glowing isn't it? 30 to 90 seconds. There's a difference to me of holding my breath underwater
[7182.78s -> 7189.53s]  versus holding my breath just sitting here. I feel like I can hold it for much longer in
[7190.09s -> 7200.73s]  water. Does that make sense? Is there any scientific reason for that? All right I went
[7200.73s -> 7218.22s]  all the way right. I don't see a shark. That's an actual thing. I'm gonna pick this up and then go
[7218.22s -> 7238.57s]  down. Although I do want these sell for a lot. The hell just happened? Underwater you're not absorbing
[7238.57s -> 7255.10s]  any oxygen through the skin. That's not correct. I don't think that's correct. Why did I think
[7255.10s -> 7289.74s]  that was real for one second? Shock shock shock. This is mine. All right I gotta get up. I guess I
[7289.74s -> 7300.94s]  could get some of these. Hold on. I'm just going right up here anyways. What about the jellyfish?
[7300.94s -> 7324.22s]  That's one star. I didn't use a gun. Plenty of factors like pressure movement and exertion
[7324.22s -> 7327.66s]  and energy. Free diving or other types of swimming. Also depending on the amount of
[7327.66s -> 7335.96s]  oxygen percentages you take in. Hey just got here. Can you please tell me to fuck off? Thanks in
[7335.96s -> 7364.66s]  advance. Get the fuck out of here. I like the sniper rifle. We got a good menu tonight. This
[7364.66s -> 7411.99s]  is gonna be good. I bet I could do 60 seconds. Salt grilled. Oh this is a good one. 48 coins.
[7411.99s -> 7433.34s]  Let's do them all. Those things are so easy to get to. Okay so what can I do now? What do we got?
[7433.34s -> 7439.70s]  This one. This one is going on the menu because that's what the food critic wants.
[7443.51s -> 7473.06s]  I'm not gonna upgrade it. Okay salt. Where did I get salt? From the ocean? I calculated based on
[7473.06s -> 7477.46s]  your height and body weight and other factors. It is impossible for you to hold your breath for
[7477.46s -> 7489.48s]  60 seconds. You're smart chatter. You are tapping into insecurities of mine. Prove without me doing
[7489.48s -> 7495.70s]  it. That I can't do that. So like I calculated based on your height and like your weight and
[7495.70s -> 7501.93s]  everything. Oh you must have calculated it. All right bro. I'll prove you wrong. I know it's a
[7501.93s -> 7518.17s]  very good attempt. A really good attempt because you think oh well fuck you. I'm gonna go on full
[7518.17s -> 7539.24s]  cam and hold my breath till I turn fucking purple. Like no I'm not gonna do that. Yeah I don't think
[7539.24s -> 7545.13s]  I would have very much fun holding my breath as long as I could. No I'm just like playing Dave
[7545.13s -> 7550.60s]  the Diver you know. I'm just kind of hanging out. I don't think I want to hold my breath.
[7550.60s -> 7579.86s]  There's a lot of people here. Disgusting as usual. Apparently not disgusting. Yeah don't hold your
[7579.86s -> 7588.06s]  breath. Breathe. Don't be an idiot. Don't be stupid. All right I'm gonna hold my breath as long. Don't
[7588.06s -> 7609.59s]  do that. Don't be stupid. She really likes it. It is lovely. The book of five rings states that one
[7609.59s -> 7623.32s]  should look at the essence of something instead of its appearance. Okay you pass. Just pretend
[7623.32s -> 7634.68s]  you're holding your breath. How would chat even know? We mean go on cam and take a big
[7636.20s -> 7639.48s]  and puff my cheeks out but I'm just breathing through my nose the whole time.
[7640.28s -> 7654.49s]  I have a counter going in the corner. I'm just being like
[7657.54s -> 7672.57s]  like trying to communicate every such dog shit. How long can I hold my breath? Take a phone call
[7677.98s -> 7683.02s]  and do the thing where it's like yeah sorry man. I really gotta go. I gotta go. I'm doing
[7683.02s -> 7696.46s]  a thing on stream. I gotta go. Then puff the cheeks out again. Just do it without a face cam.
[7696.46s -> 7699.66s]  All right you guys ready? Time me. How long can I hold my breath for? You ready?
[7710.70s -> 7713.66s]  Oh that had to be like a minute. How long was that?
[7716.60s -> 7727.27s]  Jeez. How long was that? 10 seconds. That's gotta be a record.
[7729.59s -> 7741.99s]  You just take a screenshot of your face with your cheeks puffed out and closing your nose
[7741.99s -> 7750.47s]  with a timer going like hey I'm doing it right now. How long can I hold my breath? I'm still
[7750.47s -> 7759.62s]  talking over the stream. That doesn't make any sense. I am going for and right going for world
[7759.62s -> 7776.04s]  record. Play in silence. Oh I really wish I had clothing on. I wish I had a shirt on right now
[7776.92s -> 7785.69s]  and I am fucking gross. I oh man I have to like I haven't I like feel kind of like shit too.
[7785.69s -> 7795.69s]  Like this is not the day. All right save this. I promise I will do this on the next stream. Wait
[7795.69s -> 7801.50s]  the next stream is going to be the house flipper invitational joke thing. Maybe I'll just do it on
[7801.50s -> 7808.74s]  there and just everyone will think I'm a weirdo. We already have a screenshot. Wait why do you
[7808.74s -> 7823.13s]  all I hate this picture though. Okay anyone else? It's this one could do it. This image does not
[7823.13s -> 7838.70s]  convey I'm holding my breath. This is I'm holding in laughter. Oh that thing was so funny but I
[7838.70s -> 7845.62s]  can't laugh because then I'll lose. No that's not holding my breath. That's you laugh you lose.
[7846.26s -> 7900.23s]  I like this one. This one's so stupid. How long can I hold my breath for? I can't. I can't. It's
[7900.23s -> 7911.51s]  not even close. I am wicked red and this one is fucked. Okay this is definitely the one.
[7920.31s -> 7973.74s]  This is absolutely the one. Okay so then no hold on. Okay I need it needs to be a timer. Hold on
[7973.74s -> 8003.67s]  hold on a second. Let me get a timer. Okay stopwatch. Well no no not it needs to be yeah like
[8003.67s -> 8033.53s]  this. This is okay I like it though. Okay hold on. Is this one? No not that one. There it is. We got
[8033.53s -> 8054.07s]  to prepare this. It's very important. Okay I'm just cropping it so you can see it better.
[8054.07s -> 8102.01s]  All right you ready? All right I'm going for it. See how long I can do it for.
[8217.82s -> 8231.11s]  What's up? Yeah I'm in the middle of streaming. Yeah I'll call you in like a couple hours. All
[8231.11s -> 8272.28s]  right dude. All right yeah I'm streaming. Bye bye. Time what's that? 241 come on. And a phone call
[8272.28s -> 8296.46s]  in the middle. Yeah that was funny. That's literally nothing. That's a lot if I were to actually
[8296.46s -> 8300.70s]  do it. Don't try that at home by the way. You can actually hurt yourself doing that. Don't fuck
[8300.70s -> 8306.18s]  around. It's a funny bit but don't fuck around. It's actually kind of dangerous to do that to
[8306.18s -> 8322.86s]  yourself. All right I need it. Whoa it's all right. Okay mom. I just want to make sure people
[8322.86s -> 8338.63s]  understand that. Okay if that makes me mom then that makes me mom. But I'm gonna say it. Okay
[8338.63s -> 8350.89s]  mom. Look at it and all this is all ruined now. No it's the most expensive thing on the menu.
[8350.89s -> 8356.81s]  Oh but it's right here. It's right here. No no I just it's like when somebody's like towing
[8356.81s -> 8368.66s]  your car and you like walk out you're just like I'm fucking right here. God damn it. Who even
[8368.66s -> 8384.12s]  ordered this? Who ordered this? Why did he make this? Oh my god. It's because we did a little
[8384.12s -> 8392.87s]  routine. I had it up the whole time. There was a little routine we did. All right you can't say
[8392.87s -> 8398.23s]  that that's oh he's so bad. He's so bad. I literally stopped in the middle of that to do a I'm going
[8398.23s -> 8419.40s]  for the breath world record joke. Can I guess where this is from? This is this is from WarioWare
[8419.40s -> 8436.10s]  isn't it? This is a I'm mad at WarioWare face. Is that wrong? Rhythm heaven. Yep okay same kind
[8436.10s -> 8459.78s]  of genre. Yeah same genre. You were holding your breath the whole Wario stream. Nah you really are
[8459.78s -> 8473.62s]  impossible. Blue shells and brown shells. I can't understand your underlying anatomy in this picture.
[8473.70s -> 8490.66s]  What is your neck doing? Um well like we can examine it if you want. So that's that's my chin.
[8490.66s -> 8500.82s]  It's not my neck. This is where my face kind of ends but there's more face. That is really strange
[8500.82s -> 8512.89s]  looking isn't it? This is my chin. That's the bottom of my chin. See I have created a second
[8512.89s -> 8520.17s]  face on top of my face. That's gotta be worth something right? That's gotta be worth something.
[8520.17s -> 8545.50s]  Like a turtle going back into its shell. I might just do air twice. Oh I need 400. I'll save the
[8545.50s -> 8559.19s]  rest or can be crafted. Should I make this? Jerma you're wilding in the morning. I see why you
[8559.19s -> 8567.06s]  stream later. I feel like I've been pretty chilled out and kind of low key this stream. What do you
[8567.06s -> 8575.72s]  mean? I think I've been like kind of relaxing this whole time. This is a this is a little more
[8575.72s -> 8583.18s]  toned uh like dialed down like toned down. Should I make this? I already have one don't I?
[8583.82s -> 8596.78s]  You ever gonna go back to Final Fantasy 16? I want to but I think I'm gonna um think I'm just gonna
[8596.78s -> 8610.47s]  stream it. I'm gonna play it on my own time. Stream it on my own time? I don't know. Should
[8610.47s -> 8633.08s]  I have crafted that? I will. I was looking forward to it. I haven't completely ruled it out. Just
[8633.88s -> 8638.81s]  not uh there's like just other things that for instance the next time I'm streaming is
[8638.81s -> 8652.66s]  Monday and that's the house flipper invitational stream. So it would have to be after that. Oh a
[8652.66s -> 8656.76s]  lot of people weren't here. I could talk about it again. Actually let me go over a few really
[8656.76s -> 8661.72s]  important things because I think a lot of people trickled in over the last hour or two. Um in like
[8661.72s -> 8671.51s]  30 minutes or so we are going to raid uh Sea Dog Connor's stream. Connor is doing a charity auction
[8671.51s -> 8683.10s]  stream today and I have two different bundles in the event. Two Grotto Beast themed items bundles.
[8683.10s -> 8694.07s]  One of them's a raffle. One of them's an auction. That is where you are going. It's all benefiting
[8694.07s -> 8704.31s]  the Immune Deficiency Foundation. It's a lot of items. I'm not the only one. There is I believe
[8704.31s -> 8710.18s]  dozens and dozens and dozens of items from different streamers and youtubers that are going
[8710.18s -> 8720.18s]  up for auction and raffle. And I think the raffle my raffle my item I think is going to be pretty
[8720.18s -> 8733.05s]  early in the show. So make sure you go check that out. It's not the face mold. I told you no one's
[8733.05s -> 8741.13s]  getting that. In fact I I might just destroy it. It's really possible that I just destroy it because
[8741.13s -> 8747.90s]  it's like nobody can have this. It's just too just far too powerful of an object. I might just crush
[8747.98s -> 8760.82s]  it. You know what I mean? Like I know but that can't exist. But that's what's happening today.
[8762.81s -> 8771.91s]  Go support that stream regardless if there's items of mine that are in it. If you got some time
[8771.91s -> 8782.78s]  please support it. Also on Monday July 3rd we're doing a house flipper invitational
[8782.78s -> 8791.34s]  joke. It is not like actually officially endorsed by anything. Um just me and I got rewards for this.
[8795.93s -> 8801.05s]  Uh yeah so I'm gonna I'm trying to get like somewhere between five and ten streamers. I've
[8801.05s -> 8811.00s]  already reached out to a bunch of people already. We're gonna do a house flipper flip off where
[8811.00s -> 8815.48s]  everybody gets about 60 to 90 minutes. Everyone starts at the same time and everyone starts at
[8815.48s -> 8824.76s]  the same house. And then it's pencils down give me a tour now of your house. And I'm going to be
[8824.76s -> 8831.86s]  grading them on creativity, complexity, philosophy, theming, structural integrity, cleanliness. I have
[8831.86s -> 8851.90s]  an entire system and there is the object I need right there. Explain philosophy. Your design
[8851.90s -> 8870.44s]  philosophy. This is my grading system okay. You make your own grading system. Yeah there's a few
[8870.44s -> 8878.20s]  more people I'm going to reach out to this weekend. Tonight and tomorrow. I think it's going to be a
[8878.20s -> 8885.72s]  really fun time. I think it's going to be just jokey fun. Not going to be too serious. Just to
[8885.72s -> 8902.70s]  have some fun. What are you going to stream on your end? Dave the Diva. Now I'll probably
[8902.78s -> 8910.49s]  hang out in house flipper and sort of make my own maybe. Or just kind of be chilling out painting
[8910.49s -> 8935.72s]  walls. Yeah I am those of you that know me and those that have been you know invited or will
[8935.72s -> 8944.62s]  be invited. Why can I not catch this? There's a specific criteria that you should probably be
[8944.62s -> 8949.75s]  following. I'm not going to tell you how to make your house or anything but I cannot catch this
[8953.02s -> 8969.37s]  long time. I'm still contemplating if I want theming right. I give like a couple of words.
[8969.37s -> 8972.41s]  Let's just say I'm not going to use these because I don't want to you know this is not a leak.
[8972.41s -> 8978.94s]  Well let's just say that it was like okay and you're here at your house and your words are
[8979.66s -> 8989.61s]  sunshine dog food and pickles. What does that mean? You tell me. You tell me what that means.
[8989.61s -> 9009.67s]  That's a leak. No it's not. I'm not going to use those. I need one more blue shell and we're good
[9009.67s -> 9036.18s]  but I don't think I can get it. What brand of dog food did you have for breakfast today?
[9042.65s -> 9055.75s]  I actually had a coffee and that was it as of right now. I want to go deeper. No more this you
[9055.75s -> 9063.58s]  know like 50 meters candy. I want to go down to like 150. That's not breakfast dude eat something.
[9063.58s -> 9068.20s]  I usually do. I usually do. I usually do. I'll be all right don't worry. It's been like two hours
[9068.20s -> 9080.31s]  three hours. I usually will have some kefir. If you're a long time viewer of this channel you know
[9080.31s -> 9094.94s]  that kefir is a drink that I very much enjoy. He's always loved kefir. Of course I have. A very
[9094.94s -> 9103.06s]  great thing to consume. Good for you. Doesn't have any really like bullshit in it for your digestive
[9103.06s -> 9120.15s]  track. I need that now. You ever have peach flavored? I like blueberry kefir myself. Too
[9120.15s -> 9133.91s]  much kefir will cause kidney stones. Uh you're not you're not gonna be one of those people that's
[9133.91s -> 9139.70s]  like hey you know that if you eat too many apples it gives you you know fucking diarrhea. I'm not
[9139.70s -> 9146.49s]  gonna eat 10 apples. You said you love apples. I do like apples. Well but you you you must eat
[9146.49s -> 9152.04s]  three every day. I don't. Well why'd you say that then? You don't love apples then. I do.
[9152.04s -> 9191.19s]  Well then you must eat 10 a day. I don't. Do you think I can take them? That hurt a lot. God damn
[9191.19s -> 9216.06s]  it. Oh he's gonna cut me with it. Oh shit. What? Oh my god I have to get out of here right now.
[9217.10s -> 9229.29s]  Just eat this. Eat it. Eat it quick. We're good. You're back here. The wuss running away and that's
[9229.29s -> 9251.74s]  I got a shark meat but I love kefir. Oh you do? Improve it then. Drink a whole kefir right now.
[9251.74s -> 9258.02s]  It's really good. I promise. Does it actually give you kidney stones? Is that person full shit?
[9258.02s -> 9279.13s]  Bullshit. It has to be. It's yogurt. It's yogurt adjacent. It's a yogurt cousin. It's not.
[9279.13s -> 9298.39s]  It's yogurt. Research level gained. Eco watcher. Mission based app made to protect the environment.
[9299.03s -> 9302.15s]  You get points for completing missions on the app and get rewards for reaching certain levels.
[9306.10s -> 9318.66s]  This was for points on the app not for a paper. Oh dear. Dude kefir is a treatment for kidney stones.
[9319.22s -> 9324.98s]  There's a lot of just misinformation in this chat right now. I need a verified source. It can't just
[9324.98s -> 9342.28s]  be like fucking like Greg. Kefir kidney stones. I need to see what's going on here. It's good.
[9342.28s -> 9347.05s]  It's good for you. Don't listen to anybody. It literally helps with that. It helps with that.
[9354.66s -> 9369.06s]  WebMD Wilson. I don't know. Do you trust like bill from the subway or WebMD? I don't know. Which one
[9369.06s -> 9384.06s]  of those do you choose? Kefir is good for you and will help alleviate some gut bacteria issues
[9384.06s -> 9389.90s]  and is good for you and can help break up potential kidney stones. Hey that shit gives you kidney
[9389.90s -> 9400.26s]  stones. Don't listen to that fucking idiot. That's a liar. I would trust a real doctor and not a
[9400.26s -> 9408.06s]  website but you can't make an appointment to the doctor. Call the doctor. You can't call the doctor
[9408.06s -> 9411.82s]  and say hey doctor hi I'd like to have an appointment. Okay what are you coming in for?
[9411.82s -> 9418.15s]  Well you see um I just want to ask you a question. What do you okay you you're having any symptoms?
[9418.15s -> 9424.71s]  No I don't have any symptoms. What are you doing here? Well you see um do kefir cause kidney stones?
[9427.06s -> 9433.62s]  No. Okay you feel okay? I feel great. Okay bye. That's not how you don't you can't make it a
[9433.62s -> 9444.62s]  you don't go to like urgent care to ask that question. That's what your primary care doctor
[9444.62s -> 9449.50s]  is for. Yeah when you have like a an appointment like a physical yeah go ahead ask it but to make
[9449.50s -> 9456.90s]  an appointment specifically to ask the doctor if like eating watermelon will give you gas.
[9456.90s -> 9471.02s]  It's like I this this that's I don't think that's like a symptom. Getting a little scared of your
[9471.02s -> 9485.19s]  kefir consumption levels hmm. The whom on the end of that is my favorite. Okay we need another
[9485.19s -> 9514.18s]  staff member. Kitchen or dining area probably dining area. Training to consider. This is a
[9514.18s -> 9518.10s]  lot deeper than I thought this was a game where you swim around and collect fish. This is much
[9518.10s -> 9538.49s]  deeper than I thought it was going to be. I like it 150 to train. Yeah let's do it. Not too much
[9538.49s -> 9549.21s]  and not too little. Yeah do you guys honestly think the guy who has said Ben Franklin's name
[9549.21s -> 9556.04s]  probably more than every twitch streamer on this website combined ever you think is gonna
[9556.04s -> 9578.76s]  argue for like over consuming something. Oh I got 10 of these. He's in hell that's fine he's in hell
[9578.76s -> 9605.29s]  whatever whatever I what do you want to say. This dude takes advice from hell dwellers. A hell
[9605.29s -> 9617.67s]  dweller that's an interesting term. Hell dweller. All right this thing is look at the money I'm
[9617.67s -> 9642.01s]  gonna get from this. I gotta stop picking these up they're not worth anything anymore. I like the
[9642.01s -> 9647.78s]  way your earlobes stick out. Have a great stream. Hey thanks. First time chatter first thing you
[9647.78s -> 9654.31s]  ever said. Actually thank you. That's a good that's a compliment. Usually the first time chatters
[9654.31s -> 9660.76s]  say hey are you that guy that did X. Are you are you that guy that did this. I'm not even playing
[9660.76s -> 9667.08s]  the fucking game anymore. Like you see what's going on. Are you the sus guy. Are you the guy
[9667.08s -> 9684.30s]  that did X. You guys did Y. Right like are you that guy. I hate that guy. Somebody where's the
[9684.30s -> 9690.25s]  I should have put the person in the kitchen because I I don't know there's not enough food
[9690.25s -> 9718.20s]  to go around. There's not enough food to go around. He can't cook it fast enough. By the way don't I
[9718.20s -> 9728.36s]  have a staff member. What is going on. Where are they. Thank you. Thank you. Actually nice job.
[9731.05s -> 9756.54s]  Staff is asking for a raise. I have to return to that game one one day. It's been long enough I
[9756.54s -> 9764.57s]  think. I'm afraid to play Casino Inc because I feel like that's it's like the peak of my entire
[9764.65s -> 9774.33s]  Twitch career was how much fun I had in that game and I'm scared that I'll go back and taint it.
[9774.33s -> 9778.49s]  It almost lives as this perfect memory in my brain that I kind of don't want to mess with it.
[9789.67s -> 9799.45s]  Management app which works on your smartphone. Sounds handy.
[9802.82s -> 9828.33s]  Management app. All these apps. I think we're doing pretty good. Can never be replicated again. The
[9828.33s -> 9832.25s]  fire happening after waiting for it was the best build up and payoff that can never be replicated.
[9832.25s -> 9841.90s]  Yeah yeah at some point you know when you're doing a sequel you're just kind of grasping for that how
[9841.90s -> 9848.02s]  much fun you had and the sequel is just kind of like it was okay. We kind of remembered some of
[9848.02s -> 9858.90s]  the funny things. It's kind of funny because that's like my worst enemy is not wanting to do things
[9858.90s -> 9868.90s]  more than once. A lot of the shows and like events and stuff that you've seen I was just like no I
[9868.90s -> 9872.79s]  don't want to do this again like I want to do something else and it's kind of a detriment
[9872.79s -> 9879.32s]  because it's like well would you ever want to do like six or ten episodes of that and I'm just like
[9879.32s -> 9894.30s]  no not really and it's kind of a detriment sometimes. Can I get this now? That was sad.
[9894.30s -> 9903.43s]  That was really sad. I just shot this fish in the fucking head. That was like sad. That was kind of
[9903.43s -> 9922.38s]  sad. Am I poisoned? All right I'm going down deeper. I get bored incredibly easily
[9923.19s -> 9929.26s]  so and plus I don't know I feel like there's other ideas I like and I want to do. I feel like each
[9929.26s -> 9938.95s]  thing that I do is fun to have it live sort of in a little bubble on its own. It's typically how I
[9938.95s -> 9987.34s]  feel and this thing is aggressive. Do not please don't. Barracuda. I want a squid. I don't think
[9987.34s -> 10002.01s]  I've even found one of these yet. Yeah is Connor's stream live right now or is it starting soon?
[10002.01s -> 10013.86s]  10 minutes? Yeah. Again if you don't know what's going on in 10 minutes I'm going to dump you all
[10013.86s -> 10021.35s]  over on SeaDog on Connor's channel. There's a whole big charity auction stream going on today.
[10021.35s -> 10028.81s]  I have a couple of items that are included. One bundle is for the auction. One bundle is for a
[10028.81s -> 10045.16s]  raffle. So I believe they're doing my raffle bundle pretty early I think on the uh in the show. All
[10045.16s -> 10064.20s]  right last one and I'm gonna go. I feel like this game is for Marvel nerds? Marvel nerds? What do
[10064.20s -> 10073.02s]  you mean why are you truing that? Marvel nerds? I think it's just a fun game about diving in the
[10073.02s -> 10090.33s]  ocean and collecting fish and stuff. Where are you getting that from? Activate? These are mines.
[10090.33s -> 10102.86s]  All right I actually I gotta go up. I might be in trouble. Is this the ceiling? Hurry hurry hurry.
[10102.86s -> 10153.78s]  It's kind of rude. Like what? It just exploded. That's like I'm fine. I mean dude what are you
[10153.78s -> 10172.06s]  doing? What are you doing? I'm fine. I have a escape pod right there. Before you raid Connor
[10172.06s -> 10187.74s]  can you just get a DMCA strike? What is stop? All right I think they're about to start. Is the
[10187.74s -> 10195.83s]  countdown still there? Let me check. 10 minutes? 5 minutes? Is there enough to do one um one uh
[10195.83s -> 10204.62s]  restaurant evening? Six minutes? Oh let's let's yeah let's get you over there. I don't want to
[10204.62s -> 10214.09s]  be late. You need to do one stream that deserves a sequel is a kill the meme stream. I talked about
[10214.09s -> 10226.38s]  that six months ago. All right guys go say hello to Connor. A couple of grotto beast related items
[10226.94s -> 10240.38s]  bundles are available for raffle and for auction. Please go support it. We'll see you again. Let me
[10240.38s -> 10251.86s]  just get this set up. Yeah everything supports the immune deficiency foundation so go hang out. I'm
[10251.86s -> 10260.55s]  very curious how some of these items do especially the auction ones. Yeah I'll see you guys on Monday
[10260.55s -> 10267.77s]  house flipper competition with a bunch of streamers. Should be a good time. I'll be in offline chat
[10268.73s -> 10274.17s]  probably on Sunday night giving some more details or just show up on Monday 4 o'clock pacific.
[10274.73s -> 10300.70s]  Sounds good. All right see you later. Take care. Have a great night. Ta ta for now. We can do this
[10300.70s -> 10313.59s]  for now. Thanks for hanging out. Thanks for watching. Let's go. I'm very curious what happens
[10313.59s -> 10331.40s]  to these items. See you Monday. This music is fine for the outro. In the event that everything gets
[10331.40s -> 10349.93s]  cut off. Call your mother. Call your father too. This is nice isn't it? Yeah that was nice. See you
[10349.93s -> 10361.64s]  later bro. Drink some water. That goes for you too. Yeah sorry I've been a little messed up the last
[10361.64s -> 10373.05s]  week but it's okay. I'll be goodbye Monday. And don't trust me I'm fine. It's just some minor
[10373.05s -> 10393.66s]  annoyances. I'm good. See you later. Goodbye. Yeah it's stomach related if you're curious. I'm good.
[10393.66s -> 10397.38s]  Intestinal. I'm good. See you later.
