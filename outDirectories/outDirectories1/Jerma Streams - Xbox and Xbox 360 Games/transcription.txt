[2.68s -> 28.14s]  Oh, that was bad. Wait, hold on. That's okay. That's the first time I've, oh, I've spoken. Like, used my vocal cords in at least, I don't know, like 30 minutes. 30 or 40 minutes ago, I went, oh, auto, auto.
[28.14s -> 35.34s]  And I got ready. I haven't used them. Saliva has been down there.
[35.34s -> 60.22s]  Hello, happy Saturday. How's your weekend? Mine's doing pretty good. You guys ready for this weekend edition of the German 985 television program? Today, we've got an exciting program. This week, we're going to play Xbox games. Some original, some Xbox 360.
[60.22s -> 78.06s]  And let me just right off the bat tell you that yes, yes, we're going to play, I don't even want to say it. We're going to play, yes, we're going to play Sneak King, okay? Everybody relax.
[78.06s -> 91.86s]  I couldn't even say it. I was, I was like, my like voice trembled from like how dumb this is. Like how stupid and shitty this game is. We're going to play Sneak King.
[92.86s -> 105.26s]  Like I'm a fucking toddler, like hiding behind the couch that's very visible and you can see where they go.
[105.26s -> 109.44s]  Yeah, you ready? Yeah, you're never going to be able to find me.
[109.44s -> 115.44s]  They fucking run away and you see them. You see exactly where they go and then they jump out. You don't even have to find them.
[115.44s -> 123.44s]  You get within a 15 feet circle around where they are and they just jump out and they go, ah!
[123.44s -> 134.98s]  Like yes, okay, you're very excited, I can tell. We're going to start with an Xbox 360 game. I don't know how good this is going to be, by the way.
[134.98s -> 142.75s]  By the way, that the rule does stand on this stream, the general rule. You don't know what the general rule is.
[144.82s -> 154.78s]  We have 30 minutes to play each one of these. After 30 minutes, we decide if we're going to spend six hours. I don't know how it works.
[154.78s -> 169.47s]  It's going to be great. That's a lot of gifts. That is a lot of gifts. That's 20. Oh, my throat is fucked today.
[169.47s -> 184.50s]  What's going on? I don't know why this happens to me.
[184.50s -> 193.67s]  Anybody else feel like this? I have a like four hour window every single day where my voice is normal.
[193.67s -> 199.74s]  After like four o'clock in the afternoon, it starts to get really kind of like tired.
[199.74s -> 206.74s]  And from four in the afternoon till one a.m. before I go to bed, it's like, oh man, like it's getting a little tired talking.
[206.74s -> 212.74s]  I wake up in the morning and my voice is like this. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[212.74s -> 218.43s]  And it slowly gets normal for like three hours. Why does it do this? What's wrong with me?
[218.43s -> 226.13s]  I thought it was messed up for yelling for 20 minutes. Well, I didn't yell.
[226.13s -> 234.08s]  Maybe I'm just screaming in my sleep or something. Like screaming every night and I don't even know.
[234.08s -> 251.82s]  Talking to yourself. Smoker lungs. I don't smoke cigarettes. I don't even smoke weed. I don't do it. I don't inhale smoke.
[251.82s -> 259.15s]  That's not a lie. It's not. I don't smoke weed. I already went over this. I don't smoke weed.
[259.15s -> 265.15s]  I eat it in small quantities, controlled so I know exactly what I'm getting.
[265.15s -> 274.82s]  I need to tell you all that again. I haven't caught a stream live in ages. Well, welcome.
[274.82s -> 286.73s]  You're going to notice. I swear to God. So because we're on a once a week schedule, the like three to four hour stream is gone.
[286.73s -> 292.85s]  I'm going to sit here as long as I'm comfortable. That could be five hours. That could be eight.
[292.85s -> 300.73s]  I don't know. But something you're going to notice over in real time here, you're going to find that for our window.
[300.73s -> 307.06s]  It's not right now. It's going to be in like 45 minutes to an hour. You'll get I want someone to catch it.
[307.06s -> 319.41s]  Anyways, the first game we're going to play is the first Templar for Xbox 360. I don't this game.
[319.41s -> 323.41s]  I don't know anything about it. This is a guy with a shield on the front and he has a sword.
[325.42s -> 332.07s]  And already nobody likes it. I haven't even played it yet.
[332.07s -> 339.74s]  What was I going to say? Somebody had a question. What was I just going to say? I have no idea.
[339.74s -> 348.36s]  This game is bad. Really? You don't even know what this is. You don't know what this is.
[348.36s -> 358.64s]  This looks like a PC like flip. Wait, what do you mean? I didn't catch the whole thing.
[358.64s -> 363.93s]  Did you say this looks like a Unity flip? Is that what you said?
[363.93s -> 371.58s]  Well, this would be one of the original Unity flips. This game came out before Unity I think even existed.
[371.58s -> 377.90s]  I need to check the sound. I didn't get a chance to do that. Let's go. Ready?
[377.90s -> 385.95s]  One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.
[385.95s -> 392.61s]  Is it good? Perfect. All right. Here we go.
[392.61s -> 396.19s]  No game sound. I'm looking at it right now. I can see it.
[396.19s -> 401.67s]  What the hell was I going to say? There was something important that I had to say.
[401.67s -> 406.55s]  Cabbagehead PhD gave 25 community subs. I was in the middle of saying that. Thank you.
[406.55s -> 410.92s]  What was I going to say? One, two, three. One, two, three.
[410.92s -> 422.63s]  It should be instant when you hear it. I'm not going to play on casual. Maybe I should.
[422.63s -> 425.63s]  I'm not playing on hard. Normal. Subtitles, sure. Why not?
[425.63s -> 429.13s]  Brightness. Adjust the slider until the middle square is just barely visible.
[429.13s -> 440.05s]  Does anybody play like this? I feel like there's tons of people that just turn the thing all the way up because I can see better.
[440.05s -> 446.04s]  We're just going to go here. I hate not being able to see shit in games. It's annoying.
[446.04s -> 453.62s]  Are you ready? Are you ready for the captivating story of the first temple? That was whatever.
[453.62s -> 470.58s]  You have to wait 30 minutes. You can't just say next. We haven't even seen the intro.
[470.58s -> 473.14s]  Sit down.
[500.68s -> 505.68s]  Everyone is waiting for Sneak King. What if I just fucked with you all and I had this game custom made?
[505.68s -> 508.68s]  And it zooms into the king on the throne and it's the Burger King.
[508.68s -> 512.68s]  See, that's how you don't even know what the fuck you're going to get here. So sit down.
[525.20s -> 543.84s]  Did I play this game? This guy just woke up. I know what it's like.
[549.34s -> 555.95s]  Let's catch up with this guy in like four hours. He probably sounds like this.
[559.90s -> 562.90s]  Is this the human starting zone in Warcraft?
[569.34s -> 573.70s]  Can you hear that? Oh my god.
[575.70s -> 579.70s]  It sounds like I'm changing inking my printer over here.
[583.16s -> 592.78s]  The toughness skill grants orbs. You can't hear that?
[592.78s -> 602.13s]  Cyprus. 1291. Oh, it is a unity flip. You're right.
[602.13s -> 609.67s]  This looks like a machinima. This looks like a very well-made machinima.
[616.29s -> 629.19s]  Wait, somebody killed all these people? Why are they ready to...
[638.65s -> 642.65s]  Why would you close your hands together? Alright, X's attack.
[644.91s -> 649.05s]  Nice. This is the best machinima I've ever seen.
[654.30s -> 656.30s]  Who's talking? Me? Okay.
[656.30s -> 660.30s]  Well, this game is not going to be very fun. This is going to be gone in a half an hour, I guarantee it.
[660.30s -> 664.69s]  Playing in a machinima. What, you don't remember that?
[664.69s -> 669.27s]  If you didn't feel like setting all the characters up and stuff,
[669.27s -> 675.27s]  you would go from a cinematic view to just take the HUD away and start fucking slashing at each other and stuff.
[675.27s -> 680.77s]  And you would use that, because how much of a pain in the ass would that be to actually set all that up?
[680.77s -> 698.50s]  Alright, what do I need to do? Is there a sprint? What do I have to do? Just leave?
[698.50s -> 710.94s]  Castle of Griffinstein 2. Oh, here we go. Alright.
[710.94s -> 714.94s]  You can block enemy attacks by holding down right trigger to block an attack coming from a different direction.
[714.94s -> 717.94s]  Tilt L in that direction while holding RT down.
[717.94s -> 733.77s]  Alright, that's a block. I just need like a young, like 12 year old voice to narrate what's going on right now.
[733.77s -> 735.77s]  And then it would be a real machinima.
[735.77s -> 743.02s]  Alright, block. With a really puffy mic.
[743.02s -> 749.14s]  What I mean by puffy mic, I mean that every time you say the word, any word with P or T in it,
[749.14s -> 752.41s]  it sounds like your eardrums are blowing up.
[752.41s -> 757.78s]  For example, I'm going to give you a warning here. This is going to be horrible.
[757.78s -> 776.41s]  Okay, so please, please take me to your general so I can push him over the edge.
[776.41s -> 780.72s]  That's what it was like. That's still kind of what it's like. I'm sorry, this is probably loud.
[780.72s -> 786.60s]  All the golden arrow on your minimap to your main objective. The minimap is located in the upper left corner of your screen.
[786.60s -> 793.64s]  Alright, let's go. Put a filter on? Maybe I will eventually.
[793.64s -> 809.28s]  This game is so ugly, but like I'm still interested. I'm not giving up yet.
[809.28s -> 812.46s]  I'm not next game. Wait a minute, just give me a minute.
[812.46s -> 817.46s]  Let me just do it like the fucking 12 year old does a machinima joke and then we'll move on to Sneak King, I guarantee it.
[817.46s -> 831.22s]  Play a Lego game? The dots, orange dots on your minimap represent healing items.
[831.22s -> 838.98s]  They can take food or fresh water. Lego Lord of the Rings?
[838.98s -> 843.93s]  I think a lot of people don't know what one of the next games could be.
[843.93s -> 848.70s]  And yes, I did make sure they were all backwards compatible.
[853.46s -> 859.86s]  It has to be, like this game is going to be fun, right?
[864.62s -> 865.62s]  Wilhelm screams.
[865.62s -> 872.80s]  Yo, I got an achievement playing the game and not doing anything.
[872.80s -> 881.62s]  Holy shit, wow, like what you're witnessing right now is like the achievement bubble of 2011 or 2008.
[881.62s -> 886.34s]  Everything was an achievement. Nothing was a real achievement.
[886.34s -> 896.89s]  Challenges, beating the game on hard or something or doing something really crazy, some real achievement.
[896.89s -> 899.89s]  Nope. Achievement bubble, 2009.
[899.89s -> 904.34s]  You drank a potion for the first time. 100 points.
[904.34s -> 909.62s]  And then it crashed. Hard. We don't care about him anymore.
[921.78s -> 924.70s]  I'm not listening to any of this.
[931.05s -> 937.82s]  I miss my beloved Xbox. A lot of 360s play most Xbox games.
[944.22s -> 947.59s]  What's my gamer score? I don't know. Not that high.
[955.29s -> 962.34s]  I know these are the rules of the order. Game score is minus two. Open your dashboard?
[966.34s -> 976.97s]  How do I see it? It's not just like right here? Left?
[976.97s -> 983.45s]  Hold on, I don't want you to see, what if like my credit card comes up or something? Hold on.
[983.45s -> 989.29s]  I don't want you to see that. I don't want you guys to see my credit card info.
[989.29s -> 993.38s]  But wait, no, no, but I even care.
[993.38s -> 999.99s]  The last credit card I put into this is from like probably like four years ago or something.
[999.99s -> 1007.33s]  Do I really care? Alright, I got 3,800 points. Is that good?
[1007.33s -> 1012.66s]  3,825. What was considered a huge gamer score?
[1012.66s -> 1018.94s]  Well, let me put it this way. What was a braggable gamer score?
[1018.94s -> 1033.20s]  200k? 20k plus? 50k plus? Damn.
[1033.20s -> 1038.66s]  Well, cool. Let's continue with the story.
[1038.66s -> 1044.54s]  Oh, the 25 subs from Cabbagehead. Thank you, Cabbagehead, for the insane subs.
[1046.72s -> 1050.48s]  50 community subs.
[1057.69s -> 1063.96s]  Alright, it's time for a prediction. Is there a mod here that can do predictions?
[1063.96s -> 1072.53s]  Will the guy on my left in the next cutscene do the like, I'm gonna give you a beatdown with his hands like this?
[1072.53s -> 1081.31s]  Like he was doing, he did twice. Will he do it a third time in the next cutscene?
[1081.31s -> 1083.31s]  Hit it up there. Let's see it. I want to see.
[1083.31s -> 1095.32s]  Ah, you can't even kill NPCs in this game. Game's not even any good. Alright, let's go.
[1095.32s -> 1099.99s]  That's easy money.
[1109.88s -> 1115.24s]  Alright, let's see. Are they any good?
[1117.24s -> 1120.93s]  Oh my god. That's another 25 subs.
[1120.93s -> 1128.14s]  Alright, will he do it?
[1129.14s -> 1136.82s]  The Xbox fucking sucks. Actually, the Xbox was fantastic.
[1136.82s -> 1139.19s]  The original Xbox was insane.
[1139.19s -> 1145.08s]  The Xbox 360, on the other hand, melted in your house all the time.
[1145.08s -> 1152.11s]  Do people remember that shit? I think a lot of the younger crowd here might not understand.
[1152.11s -> 1164.07s]  The Xbox 360, there was just a random, like, probably 20% chance that it would brick itself and die and melt inside.
[1164.07s -> 1168.08s]  That was not, oh wow, that's crazy.
[1168.08s -> 1176.95s]  Imagine if the PS5 just fucking melted inside. Like 30% of them. Wrap it up in a towel.
[1176.95s -> 1179.95s]  Yeah, and remember the videos of the people opening up the heat sink?
[1179.95s -> 1184.32s]  Like turning on an Xbox and opening the heat sink up and dropping like an egg in there?
[1184.32s -> 1187.88s]  And just cooking the egg instantly and it was like made like a fucking souffle?
[1187.88s -> 1192.40s]  I remember that video. That's fucking crazy.
[1192.40s -> 1196.93s]  Alright, what do I want? How much? I have 1000 XP.
[1196.93s -> 1199.55s]  Alright, am I gonna go...
[1199.55s -> 1203.62s]  The third attack in this combo can knock down enemies or break their shields.
[1203.62s -> 1208.02s]  It's boring. I like that one. That's a cleave.
[1208.02s -> 1211.15s]  Grants an additional zeal orb. Don't care what that is.
[1211.15s -> 1214.97s]  We're not gonna get far enough into the game to know what that is or care about it.
[1214.97s -> 1227.39s]  Yeah, this one. Alright, let's go. Are they orcs?
[1227.39s -> 1234.30s]  Well, how come we don't have a horse? Why don't we have a horse?
[1234.30s -> 1236.30s]  Didn't people ride horses?
[1236.30s -> 1244.30s]  Fucking everyone's just walking around. Enemy archers can deal severe damage from a distance.
[1244.30s -> 1247.67s]  If you see a targeting mark near you, try to move away from it.
[1247.67s -> 1249.67s]  Hold LT down and tilt L in the desired direction.
[1249.67s -> 1256.11s]  Hold LT down. Oh, alright. This is dodge.
[1256.11s -> 1263.98s]  This game reminds me of something.
[1263.98s -> 1265.98s]  Do you guys remember the Viking game?
[1265.98s -> 1274.43s]  Viking. No, there is a mobile game that's like this.
[1274.43s -> 1276.43s]  What's this fucking mobile game?
[1276.43s -> 1279.25s]  There's a mobile game that's this exact game.
[1279.25s -> 1282.25s]  I played it for like two straight days and then I was like, I'll never play it.
[1282.25s -> 1286.28s]  It's a game where you only fight guys like this in an arena.
[1286.28s -> 1288.28s]  Not Infinity Blade. No, it's something else.
[1288.28s -> 1297.42s]  No, not Clash of Clans.
[1297.42s -> 1300.42s]  Blood and Glory. That's definitely it. You are absolutely correct.
[1300.42s -> 1309.18s]  How did you get that? You're right.
[1309.18s -> 1315.29s]  Blood and Glory. Yeah, it's a mobile game.
[1315.29s -> 1323.48s]  Usually I would be really happy if mobile games have caught up.
[1323.48s -> 1330.48s]  Because remember back in 2012, 2013, 2014, having a 3D game on your phone was a huge deal.
[1330.48s -> 1338.49s]  So if phones are able to make games that look like this now, that's a really huge, awesome technological achievement.
[1338.49s -> 1340.49s]  It really is.
[1340.49s -> 1346.49s]  But they also progressed. Instead of it being like mobile games that are just ten years behind permanently,
[1346.49s -> 1352.30s]  they were making their own mobile like core engine shit.
[1352.30s -> 1357.30s]  And it's like paying five dollars to not have to wait ten minutes to play the next level and shit.
[1357.30s -> 1362.61s]  If mobile games just didn't ever do that, I think they would have like been, well they are huge.
[1362.61s -> 1368.61s]  And they're huge because it just preys on like gambling and fucking people's like need to not adapt to impatience and shit.
[1368.61s -> 1376.26s]  But what I mean is if it just stayed like this, if it was just ten years behind, that would be awesome.
[1376.26s -> 1384.05s]  Where am I going? They make the most money.
[1384.05s -> 1387.05s]  I know it's like it's just an obscene market. I know.
[1387.05s -> 1401.90s]  But if they just made games on it with the technology and not just at the same time developed the like vampire parasite neck bite that is all mobile gaming mechanics,
[1401.90s -> 1404.53s]  I think they would have, I would have liked it a lot more.
[1404.53s -> 1408.73s]  Brutal Templar Strike, a powerful version of the Templar Strike.
[1408.73s -> 1412.12s]  Who cares? Is there a jump?
[1412.12s -> 1421.40s]  There are some mobile games that are actually really fun too.
[1428.74s -> 1431.01s]  Alright.
[1431.01s -> 1434.02s]  XXX breaks shields.
[1434.02s -> 1436.83s]  Okay, so it's been 25 minutes.
[1436.83s -> 1450.77s]  I have five minutes to do something interesting or we're going to have to move on because this is just like a really, you know what this makes me want to play?
[1450.77s -> 1456.66s]  This makes me want to play Shadow of War.
[1456.66s -> 1458.66s]  I mean, what do you mean not enough?
[1458.66s -> 1461.56s]  We need a cut scene.
[1461.56s -> 1462.56s]  Oh shit, that's right.
[1462.56s -> 1464.56s]  I was about to just exit the game.
[1464.56s -> 1467.89s]  I forgot about the stupid prediction.
[1467.89s -> 1472.07s]  We do need a cut scene.
[1472.07s -> 1473.07s]  That's right.
[1473.07s -> 1478.07s]  After the next cut scene, maybe we'll get out of here and we'll put out a sneak king because I'm going to play that for 20 minutes.
[1478.07s -> 1479.07s]  You know it.
[1479.07s -> 1483.42s]  And then, holy shit, I got a big one for you.
[1483.42s -> 1485.42s]  I got a lot of Xbox and Xbox 360 games.
[1485.42s -> 1491.10s]  Why is that so hard?
[1491.10s -> 1492.10s]  Why was it?
[1492.10s -> 1494.68s]  Who's?
[1494.68s -> 1495.68s]  Is this talking?
[1495.68s -> 1497.68s]  Who's talking to me?
[1497.68s -> 1501.78s]  Why does this guy have a Batman voice?
[1501.78s -> 1505.62s]  That's just Batman.
[1505.62s -> 1512.42s]  Alright.
[1512.42s -> 1513.42s]  Brutal Templar Strike.
[1513.42s -> 1519.50s]  I don't have enough mana.
[1519.50s -> 1520.74s]  This is stupid.
[1520.74s -> 1525.25s]  Jeremy, you have to play Halo.
[1525.25s -> 1527.25s]  I'm not going to play Halo.
[1527.25s -> 1531.15s]  I don't like Halo.
[1531.15s -> 1532.15s]  Alright.
[1532.15s -> 1534.15s]  Can we give that a rest finally forever?
[1534.15s -> 1536.15s]  I don't like the game Halo.
[1536.15s -> 1537.15s]  I don't like the game.
[1537.15s -> 1539.42s]  I'm sorry.
[1539.42s -> 1541.42s]  I know everyone's going to be really mad at me.
[1541.42s -> 1543.42s]  I don't like Halo.
[1543.42s -> 1544.42s]  It's just a...
[1544.42s -> 1545.42s]  I don't like it.
[1545.42s -> 1547.42s]  It's not that I hate it.
[1547.42s -> 1551.45s]  I just don't enjoy playing it.
[1551.45s -> 1555.45s]  And when you have met with the prospective here of...
[1555.45s -> 1558.69s]  There's like five Halo games.
[1558.69s -> 1560.86s]  And everyone expects you to play them.
[1560.86s -> 1566.58s]  I'm going to die.
[1566.58s -> 1568.58s]  You got your Halo stream when me and Joel played it.
[1568.58s -> 1571.74s]  And then that was it.
[1571.74s -> 1573.74s]  It's never happening again.
[1573.74s -> 1575.56s]  Will you just kill him?
[1575.56s -> 1579.34s]  It's based gamer cringe.
[1579.34s -> 1583.46s]  Look.
[1583.46s -> 1584.46s]  I know Halo.
[1584.46s -> 1586.46s]  There's a big bunch of fans.
[1586.46s -> 1588.46s]  It's got a lot of support.
[1588.46s -> 1593.34s]  It's considered a very, very good shooter.
[1593.34s -> 1595.22s]  I know.
[1595.22s -> 1597.22s]  But we don't all have to like the same things.
[1597.22s -> 1599.53s]  Your journey ends here.
[1599.53s -> 1605.26s]  No opponent's going to make special, more devastating attacks.
[1605.26s -> 1606.26s]  The Super X.
[1606.26s -> 1607.89s]  Yes, we do.
[1607.89s -> 1608.89s]  No, we don't.
[1608.89s -> 1613.43s]  Look, if everybody liked the same things,
[1613.43s -> 1616.43s]  and you wouldn't be able to go watch a movie, love it,
[1616.43s -> 1621.43s]  and then go hate read the 30% Rotten Tomatoes critic article
[1621.43s -> 1622.43s]  about the movie.
[1622.43s -> 1625.31s]  You wouldn't be able to do that anymore.
[1625.31s -> 1629.43s]  All right.
[1629.43s -> 1630.43s]  Watch these icons try to block or dodge.
[1630.43s -> 1631.43s]  You got it.
[1631.43s -> 1636.00s]  No cut scene.
[1636.00s -> 1637.00s]  No, not yet.
[1637.00s -> 1639.75s]  Where's this mercenary leader?
[1639.75s -> 1643.59s]  Is this the leader?
[1643.59s -> 1651.38s]  So this is the leader.
[1651.38s -> 1655.16s]  Here come more of my boys.
[1655.16s -> 1656.16s]  Oh, shit.
[1656.16s -> 1657.16s]  Here they are.
[1657.16s -> 1658.16s]  Here they are, the boys.
[1658.16s -> 1662.92s]  Uh-oh.
[1662.92s -> 1663.92s]  I'm going to die.
[1663.92s -> 1666.22s]  Where is there a drink fountain?
[1666.22s -> 1669.06s]  It's the boys.
[1669.06s -> 1671.06s]  Isn't that from Warhammer?
[1671.06s -> 1677.42s]  Boston.
[1677.42s -> 1678.42s]  Oh, my God.
[1678.42s -> 1679.42s]  Kill him.
[1679.42s -> 1681.73s]  Reload has been knocked out?
[1681.73s -> 1684.50s]  What do you mean, reload?
[1684.50s -> 1685.50s]  Go to the knocked out character
[1685.50s -> 1687.50s]  and perform the revive action to help them.
[1687.50s -> 1689.68s]  If you don't help your fallen teammate in time,
[1689.68s -> 1690.68s]  you will lose the game.
[1690.68s -> 1691.68s]  What?
[1691.68s -> 1699.62s]  How the fuck am I supposed to revive him?
[1699.62s -> 1706.27s]  I can't revive him.
[1706.27s -> 1710.99s]  Not enough zeal?
[1710.99s -> 1711.99s]  Did I get him?
[1711.99s -> 1714.13s]  Look at this fucking bubble.
[1714.13s -> 1726.42s]  Are you kidding me?
[1726.42s -> 1727.42s]  Ah!
[1727.42s -> 1731.86s]  What?
[1731.86s -> 1732.86s]  Cutscene?
[1732.86s -> 1735.86s]  Oh, cutscene!
[1735.86s -> 1745.11s]  I said open it, you fucking psycho!
[1751.05s -> 1753.05s]  That door sucks.
[1753.05s -> 1756.63s]  You could lean a vacuum against that door
[1756.63s -> 1757.63s]  and it would fall over.
[1757.63s -> 1758.63s]  Really?
[1763.09s -> 1764.09s]  He's going to do it.
[1773.57s -> 1774.57s]  Ah!
[1780.35s -> 1781.35s]  He did it!
[1781.35s -> 1782.59s]  Yes!
[1784.96s -> 1787.96s]  How could you bet against one of his four animations?
[1787.96s -> 1788.96s]  How dare you?
[1788.96s -> 1789.96s]  What are you thinking?
[1802.33s -> 1803.33s]  Why the seagulls?
[1814.63s -> 1817.63s]  Is somebody like 15 feet to the right of us?
[1817.63s -> 1821.63s]  Who has like a burger basket from the boardwalk at the beach?
[1821.63s -> 1824.63s]  And there's just seagulls just fucking attacking this guy.
[1824.63s -> 1825.63s]  Get away from me!
[1825.63s -> 1827.63s]  No, these are my french fries!
[1827.63s -> 1828.63s]  Ow!
[1829.63s -> 1830.63s]  No!
[1830.63s -> 1834.06s]  Honey, honey, get him off me!
[1835.69s -> 1838.69s]  He like throws the basket of food to get away and run,
[1838.69s -> 1839.69s]  otherwise he's just going to get murdered.
[1839.69s -> 1848.14s]  Why are we coming back here?
[1850.14s -> 1853.32s]  Oh, it's been 30 minutes.
[1856.39s -> 1858.39s]  Honey, save yourself!
[1861.89s -> 1863.89s]  Honey, get the kids!
[1870.84s -> 1871.84s]  Next game?
[1871.84s -> 1873.84s]  No, not yet.
[1873.84s -> 1882.48s]  Wait, we have a new area.
[1883.48s -> 1884.48s]  No, not yet.
[1884.48s -> 1885.48s]  Just give me a minute.
[1890.78s -> 1894.78s]  Congratulations, 16 million.
[1894.78s -> 1897.78s]  Going across to 1700 people.
[1897.78s -> 1901.11s]  You guys can't hear that.
[1901.11s -> 1902.11s]  Really?
[1902.11s -> 1903.11s]  Are you sure?
[1903.11s -> 1908.83s]  Finish this game.
[1908.83s -> 1909.83s]  I'm not going to...
[1909.83s -> 1910.83s]  No.
[1910.83s -> 1920.15s]  By the way, I also had the Burger King bumper cars game.
[1920.15s -> 1922.15s]  But I think I threw it in the trash accidentally.
[1922.15s -> 1924.15s]  I actually think I threw it away.
[1924.15s -> 1925.15s]  I don't know, I can't find it.
[1925.15s -> 1928.15s]  Find and slay the beast.
[1929.15s -> 1931.15s]  We have to see who the beast is, right?
[1931.15s -> 1934.03s]  Kill the beast.
[1934.03s -> 1935.03s]  Yes.
[1935.03s -> 1936.03s]  No, I'm sorry, we're not going anywhere.
[1936.03s -> 1937.03s]  Not yet.
[1944.71s -> 1945.71s]  No, guys, don't worry.
[1945.71s -> 1947.71s]  I'm not like a three to four hour Andy anymore.
[1947.71s -> 1950.71s]  Like, I'm doing once a week streams.
[1950.71s -> 1951.71s]  I'm here.
[1951.71s -> 1952.71s]  We've got time.
[1952.71s -> 1953.71s]  Don't worry.
[1966.98s -> 1967.98s]  What, the racing one?
[1967.98s -> 1970.16s]  I thought I had two or three of them.
[1971.16s -> 1979.80s]  Oh, and that was a bird noise.
[1991.24s -> 1992.24s]  Did he fall off?
[1992.24s -> 2005.82s]  I don't know.
[2005.82s -> 2006.82s]  They seem to be done.
[2006.82s -> 2010.94s]  They've ran out.
[2010.94s -> 2011.94s]  They ran...
[2011.94s -> 2014.90s]  Look out!
[2017.72s -> 2019.72s]  They used all their arrows in one volley.
[2019.72s -> 2023.94s]  I once got hit right in the head with an arrow.
[2023.94s -> 2024.94s]  Don't you?
[2024.94s -> 2025.94s]  Won't this make it worth it?
[2025.94s -> 2027.94s]  It'll make everything worth it, won't it?
[2027.94s -> 2030.70s]  If an arrow goes through his neck
[2030.70s -> 2032.70s]  and gives him Frankenstein bolts,
[2032.70s -> 2033.70s]  this will be worth it.
[2033.70s -> 2034.70s]  Ow!
[2034.70s -> 2035.70s]  Fuck, it hit me.
[2036.70s -> 2039.15s]  Come on.
[2039.15s -> 2041.15s]  Please, just hit this guy in the neck with an arrow.
[2041.15s -> 2042.15s]  That's all I want.
[2042.15s -> 2044.15s]  I got to try to stand right next to him
[2044.15s -> 2045.15s]  so it can't hit me.
[2045.15s -> 2057.08s]  God damn it!
[2057.08s -> 2058.08s]  No, hit him!
[2058.08s -> 2060.08s]  He's in the fucking way.
[2060.08s -> 2061.08s]  Why are they hitting me first?
[2061.08s -> 2063.08s]  He's standing in front of me.
[2063.08s -> 2072.38s]  Shoot him.
[2072.38s -> 2075.16s]  You...
[2078.41s -> 2080.84s]  They keep hitting us in the chest.
[2080.84s -> 2081.84s]  Fuck, I missed it.
[2081.84s -> 2082.84s]  Did we see it?
[2083.84s -> 2090.20s]  What's this?
[2090.20s -> 2091.20s]  Eat berries?
[2091.20s -> 2092.20s]  You don't eat random berries?
[2092.20s -> 2093.20s]  You don't know where they...
[2093.20s -> 2099.28s]  All right, can you imagine being one of these archers
[2099.28s -> 2103.28s]  and you've watched four arrows connect through this guy's chest
[2103.28s -> 2105.28s]  and stomach and stuff and he's still running up here?
[2105.28s -> 2107.54s]  Dogs.
[2107.54s -> 2109.54s]  Why are dogs just unfriendly?
[2114.77s -> 2116.07s]  Help me!
[2117.07s -> 2121.51s]  Wait, what?
[2122.51s -> 2124.78s]  Why is he dead?
[2125.78s -> 2131.37s]  They're not dead.
[2131.37s -> 2132.37s]  That's like...
[2132.37s -> 2133.37s]  They're playing dead.
[2138.64s -> 2147.34s]  A chest by an open fire.
[2147.34s -> 2148.34s]  Brutal frenzy boon.
[2148.34s -> 2149.34s]  Until the end of this chapter,
[2149.34s -> 2151.34s]  Roland has been granted brutal frenzy,
[2151.34s -> 2153.34s]  a powerful version of the frenzy skill.
[2153.34s -> 2155.34s]  Frenzy gives Roland a damage boost.
[2155.34s -> 2159.42s]  This is the shittiest chest I've ever seen in a video game.
[2159.42s -> 2162.78s]  You're telling me that inside of these chests
[2162.78s -> 2168.36s]  are motivational notes?
[2168.36s -> 2172.97s]  Who's the fucking asshole that did that?
[2172.97s -> 2173.97s]  There's no gold pieces,
[2173.97s -> 2176.97s]  potions, armor, jewels.
[2176.97s -> 2178.98s]  No.
[2178.98s -> 2180.98s]  It's motivational poetry.
[2182.54s -> 2192.52s]  They're fortune cookie chests.
[2194.72s -> 2199.22s]  Well, at least spin the paper around
[2199.22s -> 2201.22s]  and see what your lucky numbers are.
[2204.47s -> 2205.47s]  Wait, these are villagers?
[2205.47s -> 2208.18s]  Well, he's...
[2209.18s -> 2210.18s]  What?
[2211.87s -> 2212.87s]  I mean, judgmental.
[2214.82s -> 2215.82s]  Where are my coins?
[2219.72s -> 2224.16s]  I think he didn't bet on that.
[2238.22s -> 2239.22s]  That guy's way closer to his microphone
[2239.22s -> 2241.22s]  than everybody else in the whole game.
[2247.05s -> 2249.67s]  I'm staying right here.
[2249.67s -> 2252.04s]  No one will make me leave my home.
[2252.04s -> 2253.04s]  Okay.
[2253.04s -> 2262.62s]  Those are the Frosty King.
[2262.62s -> 2263.62s]  Are there choices?
[2263.62s -> 2265.62s]  All right, are there choices?
[2265.62s -> 2268.44s]  There are no choices in this game.
[2268.44s -> 2269.44s]  Too bad.
[2269.44s -> 2275.54s]  Next game?
[2275.54s -> 2278.54s]  I'm not going next game until we beat the beast.
[2278.54s -> 2279.54s]  Whoever the beast is,
[2279.54s -> 2282.54s]  and it's supposed to be this big giant mythical creature,
[2282.54s -> 2286.54s]  but it's gonna be just kind of a big guy with a flail.
[2286.54s -> 2288.98s]  That's who the beast is, in quotes.
[2295.78s -> 2299.78s]  $50,000 says I could do more trivia than you.
[2299.78s -> 2303.56s]  $100,000.
[2304.56s -> 2307.56s]  $90,000 says I'm faster than you.
[2307.56s -> 2315.14s]  Oh, yeah, beast?
[2315.14s -> 2317.14s]  I graduated from Yale.
[2317.14s -> 2318.14s]  Bring it on.
[2318.14s -> 2320.82s]  And they get every question wrong.
[2320.82s -> 2325.43s]  I don't want to kill these dogs.
[2325.43s -> 2331.34s]  I felt like I was alive for a second.
[2331.34s -> 2332.34s]  I thought, okay.
[2332.34s -> 2334.65s]  There's a skeleton in here.
[2334.65s -> 2348.30s]  Let me do the talking.
[2348.30s -> 2349.30s]  Don't give up, skeleton.
[2351.30s -> 2355.62s]  Read sign.
[2355.62s -> 2357.24s]  Oh, it's gonna be like,
[2357.24s -> 2358.24s]  this is my chest.
[2358.24s -> 2359.24s]  Please don't steal.
[2359.24s -> 2370.40s]  Here we go.
[2370.40s -> 2372.28s]  Here comes drama.
[2372.28s -> 2375.03s]  Welcome, Templars.
[2375.03s -> 2377.34s]  Have you seen the beast?
[2377.34s -> 2378.34s]  Is it near?
[2378.34s -> 2379.70s]  No, we haven't.
[2379.70s -> 2382.07s]  No, we are looking for it.
[2382.07s -> 2384.26s]  You're mad.
[2384.26s -> 2386.26s]  We're glad you're safe and sound here.
[2386.26s -> 2387.26s]  I like this game.
[2387.26s -> 2389.26s]  We can take care of ourselves.
[2389.26s -> 2391.56s]  Your swords, I can see.
[2391.56s -> 2392.56s]  Why are there so many animals in here?
[2392.56s -> 2394.80s]  Take them and save me.
[2394.80s -> 2396.80s]  The beast slaughters anyone in sight.
[2396.80s -> 2397.80s]  No, no, no.
[2397.80s -> 2399.80s]  That's, excuse me.
[2399.80s -> 2403.80s]  That's like go-to bed relaxation sounds.
[2403.80s -> 2406.58s]  I'm waiting for the,
[2406.58s -> 2408.58s]  where do they start playing the ocean one?
[2408.58s -> 2410.58s]  With a light thunderstorm.
[2419.87s -> 2420.87s]  He's here.
[2427.38s -> 2429.38s]  Wait, let me skip to the chase here.
[2429.38s -> 2431.38s]  How many legs does the beast have?
[2432.38s -> 2433.38s]  Two.
[2433.38s -> 2434.38s]  He has two legs.
[2434.38s -> 2436.38s]  He has two legs.
[2436.38s -> 2438.38s]  He doesn't want you to come over.
[2438.38s -> 2439.38s]  He does not want you to come fight him.
[2439.38s -> 2441.56s]  And he does not care.
[2441.56s -> 2442.56s]  Mr. Pirate.
[2442.56s -> 2445.59s]  It's going to be a person.
[2445.59s -> 2446.59s]  It's not going to be an animal.
[2452.40s -> 2453.40s]  It's not going to,
[2453.40s -> 2454.40s]  it's going to be a human with a flail.
[2454.40s -> 2455.40s]  It's going to, oh wow.
[2455.40s -> 2456.40s]  It's a beast.
[2456.40s -> 2458.40s]  We've seen this movie 5,000 times.
[2458.40s -> 2461.86s]  Crack the beast to its lair.
[2461.86s -> 2464.25s]  Look around.
[2464.25s -> 2471.12s]  Oh, what's in here?
[2471.12s -> 2472.12s]  Jewels?
[2474.19s -> 2475.19s]  You have found a health burn.
[2475.19s -> 2477.19s]  You'll have one additional health orb
[2477.19s -> 2478.19s]  until the end of this level.
[2478.19s -> 2480.88s]  It's because you say it doesn't mean it's real.
[2480.88s -> 2490.50s]  It's a guy.
[2490.50s -> 2491.50s]  That's a guy.
[2494.70s -> 2502.91s]  I hope they use that.
[2502.91s -> 2503.91s]  Please use it.
[2503.91s -> 2509.02s]  It's my favorite sound.
[2509.02s -> 2517.94s]  Someone is in trouble.
[2517.94s -> 2519.94s]  This guy's going to be 12 stone.
[2519.94s -> 2524.61s]  Hey, here comes the guy.
[2524.61s -> 2526.30s]  All right.
[2526.30s -> 2527.30s]  Prediction time.
[2527.30s -> 2528.30s]  Let's let's have you guys spend a little bit,
[2528.30s -> 2529.30s]  a little bit of money.
[2529.30s -> 2533.11s]  Is the beast an animal?
[2533.11s -> 2534.11s]  Yes or no.
[2534.11s -> 2539.62s]  Is the beast an animal or monster?
[2539.62s -> 2541.62s]  Like, is, well, how about it?
[2541.62s -> 2542.62s]  Let me fix this.
[2542.62s -> 2544.62s]  Is the beast humanoid?
[2544.62s -> 2547.62s]  Like a human or like a human creature?
[2547.62s -> 2550.07s]  Is it like a bear?
[2550.07s -> 2551.82s]  Is the beast a bear?
[2551.82s -> 2553.19s]  Is that better?
[2553.19s -> 2555.50s]  How do I word this the best
[2555.50s -> 2557.50s]  so the semantics people don't get mad at me?
[2557.50s -> 2565.30s]  Is the beast a guy?
[2565.30s -> 2567.95s]  Humanoid or beast?
[2567.95s -> 2568.95s]  All right.
[2568.95s -> 2569.95s]  That's a good one.
[2569.95s -> 2570.95s]  Is it?
[2570.95s -> 2576.42s]  No, no, no.
[2576.42s -> 2577.42s]  It has to be yes or no.
[2577.42s -> 2578.42s]  Does it have more than two legs?
[2578.42s -> 2579.66s]  Okay.
[2579.66s -> 2580.83s]  That's good.
[2580.83s -> 2581.83s]  Bipedal.
[2581.83s -> 2582.83s]  That's the one.
[2582.83s -> 2583.83s]  Is the?
[2583.83s -> 2584.83s]  No, because it could be like a stand up bear
[2584.83s -> 2586.83s]  like walking around with like hands.
[2586.83s -> 2588.65s]  No, no, no.
[2588.65s -> 2589.65s]  More than two legs is not.
[2589.65s -> 2590.65s]  I don't think that's fair.
[2590.65s -> 2595.00s]  Humanoid is the beast humanoid?
[2595.00s -> 2596.00s]  Done.
[2596.00s -> 2597.00s]  That's what it is.
[2597.00s -> 2606.18s]  It's human.
[2606.18s -> 2608.18s]  Humanoid is subjective.
[2608.18s -> 2609.18s]  All right.
[2609.18s -> 2611.18s]  Is the beast human?
[2611.18s -> 2613.54s]  Yes or no?
[2613.54s -> 2615.54s]  Why are we complicating this?
[2615.54s -> 2617.78s]  You guys just stand to lose a shitload of money.
[2617.78s -> 2621.46s]  Does it matter?
[2621.46s -> 2623.46s]  Does the beast have feathers?
[2623.46s -> 2626.91s]  This is a big bird.
[2626.91s -> 2632.61s]  Being a human is subjective.
[2632.61s -> 2636.41s]  Please.
[2636.41s -> 2638.29s]  All right.
[2638.29s -> 2639.29s]  Is the beast human?
[2639.29s -> 2641.55s]  Is the beast human?
[2641.55s -> 2642.55s]  Yes or no?
[2642.55s -> 2644.11s]  I like that.
[2644.11s -> 2645.11s]  Wait.
[2645.11s -> 2646.11s]  I don't want to give away any spoilers.
[2646.11s -> 2648.67s]  Because that guy next to me could be like,
[2648.67s -> 2652.67s]  Oh, yeah, that sounds just like the wolves in my town.
[2652.67s -> 2660.89s]  Is the beast human?
[2660.89s -> 2673.88s]  Does the beast come from?
[2673.88s -> 2676.18s]  What do you mean by human?
[2676.18s -> 2677.18s]  All right.
[2677.18s -> 2685.27s]  Here we go.
[2685.27s -> 2689.65s]  It's too quiet.
[2689.65s -> 2693.60s]  Does the beast feel?
[2693.60s -> 2694.60s]  Oh, the beast slayer.
[2694.60s -> 2695.60s]  Okay.
[2695.60s -> 2696.60s]  This is like a castle.
[2696.60s -> 2700.21s]  Ambush the beast here.
[2700.21s -> 2701.21s]  Yeah.
[2701.21s -> 2702.21s]  We're going to jump out.
[2702.21s -> 2703.21s]  It's going to be a guy holding firewood.
[2703.21s -> 2704.38s]  Walking back.
[2704.38s -> 2706.38s]  Walking back with a big axe or something.
[2706.38s -> 2708.38s]  He's going to be a big guy, right?
[2708.38s -> 2710.56s]  He's going to be holding firewood.
[2710.56s -> 2712.56s]  Walking slowly with the firewood.
[2712.56s -> 2714.86s]  And we're going to realize it's a human.
[2714.86s -> 2715.86s]  That's what's going to happen.
[2715.86s -> 2722.52s]  That's like a big guy.
[2722.52s -> 2725.08s]  Is that a guy?
[2725.08s -> 2727.08s]  That's a big guy, right?
[2727.08s -> 2730.34s]  That's just a huge guy.
[2730.34s -> 2731.78s]  What is it?
[2731.78s -> 2735.19s]  Is it a guy?
[2735.19s -> 2737.88s]  That's just a guy.
[2737.88s -> 2742.36s]  It's just a big huge...
[2746.07s -> 2750.17s]  Wait, don't close the prediction yet.
[2750.17s -> 2751.17s]  We don't know.
[2751.17s -> 2753.75s]  We can't tell yet.
[2753.75s -> 2755.75s]  I don't know if it's a human or not.
[2755.75s -> 2761.28s]  Not human.
[2761.28s -> 2762.28s]  But it could be.
[2762.28s -> 2763.28s]  What if it is?
[2763.28s -> 2764.28s]  We don't know.
[2764.28s -> 2765.28s]  You don't know that yet.
[2765.28s -> 2771.19s]  Just wait till he talks.
[2771.19s -> 2772.19s]  It's a troll.
[2772.19s -> 2773.19s]  We don't know what it is yet.
[2773.19s -> 2774.19s]  We don't know.
[2774.19s -> 2775.19s]  It's just the beast right now.
[2775.19s -> 2777.19s]  We're going to bring him down to like 10% health.
[2777.19s -> 2781.43s]  And we're going to get like a fucking Psycho Mantis monologue.
[2781.43s -> 2782.43s]  Just wait.
[2782.43s -> 2796.38s]  I didn't even knock him down.
[2796.38s -> 2798.71s]  That was him.
[2798.71s -> 2803.66s]  Fuck off, mate.
[2803.66s -> 2809.74s]  How could you hate dogs?
[2809.74s -> 2818.58s]  See, who's dead?
[2821.80s -> 2822.80s]  What?
[2822.80s -> 2823.80s]  Pump?
[2823.80s -> 2824.80s]  Why does that say...
[2824.80s -> 2826.98s]  What do you mean, pump?
[2826.98s -> 2827.98s]  I can't revive him.
[2827.98s -> 2828.98s]  Hurry!
[2828.98s -> 2830.34s]  I need to revive him!
[2830.34s -> 2832.34s]  How do I build up my meter?
[2832.34s -> 2839.17s]  Oh my god, he stomped on me.
[2839.17s -> 2840.17s]  Revive him!
[2840.17s -> 2842.17s]  I need to revive that guy.
[2842.17s -> 2844.17s]  He's going to die.
[2844.17s -> 2849.10s]  How do I build my meter?
[2849.10s -> 2851.10s]  Get the fuck off of me!
[2851.10s -> 2860.38s]  Oh my god, he's going to die.
[2860.38s -> 2870.77s]  How much time do I have before he is dead?
[2870.77s -> 2871.77s]  Wait, what?
[2871.77s -> 2876.31s]  Where are we restarting from?
[2883.31s -> 2884.31s]  He's human.
[2884.31s -> 2885.31s]  I don't know!
[2886.31s -> 2887.31s]  Wait, what do you mean?
[2887.31s -> 2890.58s]  Do I have to start all the way back here?
[2890.58s -> 2891.58s]  No, we don't.
[2891.58s -> 2894.29s]  He's a troll.
[2894.29s -> 2896.29s]  I need to beat him so we can confirm that.
[2896.29s -> 2897.29s]  Let's go.
[2898.29s -> 2899.29s]  He's a pretty one.
[2899.29s -> 2900.29s]  The beast.
[2900.29s -> 2902.29s]  This could be just a guy.
[2902.29s -> 2905.49s]  It's very possible this is a guy.
[2905.49s -> 2908.88s]  Like the witch!
[2908.88s -> 2910.88s]  The witch in the woods turned me into this.
[2910.88s -> 2912.88s]  I didn't want to be like this, fellas.
[2912.88s -> 2931.82s]  It was the witch and her dark heart.
[2931.82s -> 2933.83s]  He's stuck.
[2933.83s -> 2934.83s]  Watch out for the dogs.
[2934.83s -> 2936.33s]  You good?
[2936.33s -> 2939.78s]  Can I block?
[2939.78s -> 2944.86s]  Watch out!
[2944.86s -> 2945.86s]  Watch out!
[2945.86s -> 2946.86s]  Watch out!
[2946.86s -> 2955.77s]  Watch out!
[2955.77s -> 2956.77s]  Watch out!
[2956.77s -> 2957.77s]  Watch out!
[2957.77s -> 2959.07s]  Watch out!
[2959.07s -> 2960.07s]  Watch out!
[2960.07s -> 2969.95s]  Get up!
[2969.95s -> 2970.95s]  He's angry.
[2970.95s -> 2972.38s]  Uh oh.
[2972.38s -> 2973.38s]  Ah, you mammoth.
[2973.38s -> 2983.28s]  He didn't say die, troll.
[2983.28s -> 2984.28s]  Oh my god, he's going to die.
[2984.28s -> 2986.10s]  Can I revive him?
[2986.10s -> 2989.91s]  Come on, I got to revive him and go southbound.
[2989.91s -> 2992.28s]  Give me a break.
[2992.28s -> 2996.91s]  Not enough.
[2996.91s -> 2997.91s]  I have a full one.
[2997.91s -> 3007.69s]  Watch out for the dogs.
[3007.69s -> 3011.94s]  He's stuck.
[3011.94s -> 3012.94s]  Get him.
[3012.94s -> 3020.32s]  He's stuck.
[3020.32s -> 3022.07s]  Knocked down.
[3022.07s -> 3023.38s]  Okay, here we go.
[3023.38s -> 3024.38s]  This is it.
[3024.38s -> 3027.92s]  All right, who is he?
[3027.92s -> 3029.92s]  He's like the butcher in the town.
[3029.92s -> 3038.41s]  He's like the barber or something.
[3038.41s -> 3044.00s]  But what is it?
[3044.00s -> 3051.55s]  No way.
[3051.55s -> 3052.55s]  He did it.
[3052.55s -> 3054.55s]  That's canon in the game.
[3054.55s -> 3056.55s]  He's human.
[3056.55s -> 3057.55s]  He's human.
[3057.55s -> 3058.55s]  He didn't say troll.
[3058.55s -> 3059.55s]  He didn't say ogre.
[3059.55s -> 3060.55s]  He said human.
[3060.55s -> 3066.38s]  Game over.
[3066.38s -> 3070.38s]  Oh man, that's unfortunate that he said human.
[3070.38s -> 3077.45s]  Can I go in?
[3077.45s -> 3078.45s]  It is blocked.
[3078.45s -> 3083.46s]  I'm broke.
[3083.46s -> 3087.15s]  He was making all those kinds of like troll noises too.
[3087.15s -> 3091.15s]  I'm so sorry everybody, but it was confirmed in game that he was a human.
[3091.15s -> 3095.14s]  Game sucks.
[3095.14s -> 3096.14s]  Next game.
[3096.14s -> 3097.14s]  Now.
[3097.14s -> 3104.46s]  Look, you can be mad and annoyed.
[3104.46s -> 3110.11s]  Hold on.
[3110.11s -> 3113.08s]  Not yet.
[3113.08s -> 3115.08s]  I don't have my fill of this game yet.
[3115.08s -> 3118.88s]  Oh Jesus.
[3118.88s -> 3123.40s]  He just got crushed.
[3123.40s -> 3130.61s]  That was a really weird cut.
[3130.61s -> 3133.81s]  That was anime intro cut.
[3133.81s -> 3139.21s]  That was right before the breakdown.
[3139.21s -> 3142.21s]  That's when it's like...
[3142.21s -> 3144.64s]  And it cuts to like the next part.
[3144.64s -> 3147.82s]  Where like this shows like the animated fighting and stuff.
[3147.82s -> 3158.76s]  Why do you hate us so much?
[3158.76s -> 3162.76s]  I'm enjoying my video game called Templars.
[3162.76s -> 3166.54s]  I don't even know what it's called.
[3166.54s -> 3169.03s]  Melting in my seat watching this.
[3169.03s -> 3170.03s]  You're fine.
[3170.03s -> 3171.03s]  You're fine.
[3171.03s -> 3172.03s]  Turn the AC on.
[3172.03s -> 3174.46s]  Put a fan in your room.
[3174.46s -> 3175.46s]  I don't know.
[3175.46s -> 3177.98s]  You're going to be fine.
[3177.98s -> 3178.98s]  Ow.
[3178.98s -> 3181.18s]  What?
[3181.18s -> 3200.84s]  Oh.
[3200.84s -> 3201.84s]  I got you.
[3201.84s -> 3206.64s]  Watch out for this one, dude.
[3206.64s -> 3207.64s]  Careful.
[3207.64s -> 3212.34s]  Uh oh.
[3212.34s -> 3218.06s]  Dogs.
[3218.06s -> 3219.06s]  That sounded like a sneeze.
[3219.06s -> 3229.51s]  Didn't work.
[3229.51s -> 3230.51s]  What?
[3230.51s -> 3237.21s]  Hey, are these dogs human or not?
[3237.21s -> 3243.25s]  More dogs.
[3243.25s -> 3248.07s]  Oh my god.
[3248.07s -> 3250.07s]  I hate this part.
[3250.07s -> 3256.22s]  Get them off me.
[3256.22s -> 3258.22s]  The next chapter I'm done.
[3258.22s -> 3259.22s]  I don't know.
[3259.22s -> 3262.18s]  I'm having fun.
[3262.18s -> 3263.18s]  Where's your clues?
[3263.18s -> 3272.08s]  Something may be hidden nearby.
[3272.08s -> 3273.08s]  Keep your eyes open.
[3273.08s -> 3274.08s]  Something may be hidden.
[3274.08s -> 3275.08s]  Oh no.
[3275.08s -> 3277.26s]  I have to find the hidden chest.
[3277.26s -> 3279.69s]  Please stop playing this game.
[3279.69s -> 3283.46s]  I beg you.
[3283.46s -> 3284.46s]  Begging me?
[3284.46s -> 3286.46s]  You're begging me to stop playing?
[3286.46s -> 3287.46s]  I'm sorry.
[3287.46s -> 3292.69s]  There are no negotiations right now.
[3292.69s -> 3294.69s]  There is no such thing as a negotiation right now.
[3294.69s -> 3299.44s]  We've crossed the 30 minute mark, which means I'll be here for six hours.
[3299.44s -> 3301.44s]  That's how this game works.
[3301.44s -> 3302.44s]  Just kidding.
[3302.44s -> 3304.81s]  Don't take that seriously, please.
[3304.81s -> 3306.81s]  If you do, then I don't know what to tell you.
[3306.81s -> 3311.71s]  I don't know what I can do to tell you.
[3311.71s -> 3315.66s]  This is where we're going to find out who the bad guy of the game is.
[3315.66s -> 3318.90s]  We're going to find out who the beast was, right?
[3318.90s -> 3323.65s]  He was cursed by a witch, by a warlock,
[3323.65s -> 3329.91s]  and they're cursing people in the town, turning them into humans, monsters.
[3329.91s -> 3334.78s]  And stand a chance against the beast.
[3334.78s -> 3341.11s]  Your monsters stand a chance against our swords.
[3341.11s -> 3346.78s]  I'm not going to complete the game.
[3346.78s -> 3349.78s]  I have to play Sneak King for at least 20 minutes.
[3349.78s -> 3353.78s]  Listen, our holy sword, will you take it?
[3353.78s -> 3357.54s]  You don't have to repay us.
[3357.54s -> 3362.02s]  100% platinum.
[3362.02s -> 3364.02s]  Trying to pawn off a rusty blade.
[3364.02s -> 3369.38s]  Oh, she said it.
[3369.38s -> 3372.26s]  No one's seen him ever since.
[3372.26s -> 3374.82s]  Let's see.
[3374.82s -> 3380.13s]  That voice, I love this voice.
[3380.13s -> 3382.94s]  He sounds like somebody.
[3382.94s -> 3388.73s]  Disney character.
[3388.73s -> 3396.22s]  Oh, go to the outfit screen.
[3396.22s -> 3397.22s]  Employ uniform.
[3397.22s -> 3401.82s]  Commander arms.
[3401.82s -> 3404.82s]  Collect all pieces to unlock the weapon.
[3404.82s -> 3414.00s]  Why even have this?
[3414.00s -> 3416.00s]  There are 50 gifted subs.
[3416.00s -> 3421.18s]  Holy shit, from Zyxia.
[3421.18s -> 3425.49s]  We have 50 immunity subs.
[3429.11s -> 3439.89s]  Do I have to fight them?
[3439.89s -> 3445.63s]  I don't even have to fight them.
[3445.63s -> 3446.63s]  Can I leave?
[3446.63s -> 3461.12s]  Well, I think I messed everything up here.
[3461.12s -> 3462.12s]  Say something funny.
[3462.12s -> 3464.77s]  All right.
[3464.77s -> 3466.77s]  I just switched characters.
[3466.77s -> 3471.12s]  I switched characters to revive.
[3471.12s -> 3472.12s]  What?
[3472.12s -> 3481.02s]  All right, so I have to revive him now.
[3501.00s -> 3506.61s]  Isn't the one-eyed man, isn't that Bigfoot?
[3506.61s -> 3508.61s]  The person doesn't exist.
[3517.42s -> 3519.42s]  Why use that there?
[3519.42s -> 3525.42s]  Why put that there of all the places?
[3525.42s -> 3528.42s]  It was such a weird place to put that.
[3541.33s -> 3542.33s]  Spugleberry.
[3542.33s -> 3544.33s]  Oh, excuse me.
[3559.40s -> 3563.90s]  Here it comes.
[3563.90s -> 3571.13s]  This audio seems...
[3571.13s -> 3576.86s]  They're all talking from weird directions.
[3589.02s -> 3594.55s]  So loud.
[3604.75s -> 3606.76s]  Sound mixing.
[3606.76s -> 3608.76s]  Yeah, the sound mixing is very bad.
[3615.76s -> 3617.19s]  So loud.
[3634.94s -> 3635.94s]  No.
[3635.94s -> 3641.54s]  Before, I would have been doing it three or four hours ago.
[3648.14s -> 3651.72s]  Speak to Brother Lorenzo.
[3651.72s -> 3652.72s]  Wait, one of you guys, Brother Lorenzo?
[3652.72s -> 3653.72s]  No.
[3653.72s -> 3654.72s]  I'm almost done.
[3654.72s -> 3657.37s]  I promise.
[3657.37s -> 3658.37s]  There really is Geralt.
[3658.37s -> 3666.99s]  That's who it was.
[3666.99s -> 3667.99s]  Oh, hurry up.
[3667.99s -> 3671.98s]  Where's Lorenzo?
[3671.98s -> 3675.08s]  Don't touch that.
[3675.08s -> 3676.08s]  Don't touch stuff.
[3684.32s -> 3688.69s]  I'm not going to sit here and listen to a thousand years of lore.
[3688.69s -> 3691.66s]  Where's the sermon?
[3691.66s -> 3696.14s]  This is very mediocre.
[3696.14s -> 3698.70s]  Well, when did this come out?
[3698.70s -> 3702.45s]  I'm going to say 2008.
[3702.45s -> 3703.45s]  2009?
[3703.45s -> 3708.48s]  Thousand and...
[3708.48s -> 3711.30s]  Thousand and...
[3711.30s -> 3713.88s]  Where's the thing?
[3713.88s -> 3714.88s]  It doesn't say what year.
[3714.88s -> 3715.88s]  What year did this come out?
[3715.88s -> 3717.88s]  I can't see it on the back of the box.
[3717.88s -> 3718.88s]  2001?
[3718.88s -> 3719.88s]  No, it's not.
[3719.88s -> 3721.89s]  2011.
[3721.89s -> 3722.89s]  Yeah, there it is.
[3722.89s -> 3724.89s]  That's ten years old.
[3724.89s -> 3728.92s]  Which is the greatest sin?
[3728.92s -> 3734.29s]  To torture a man's body, to save his soul, or to stand idle?
[3734.29s -> 3737.28s]  Devil consumes him.
[3737.28s -> 3741.28s]  If you, the righteous, do not oppose the devil...
[3741.28s -> 3743.29s]  How old is Skyrim?
[3743.29s -> 3745.29s]  ...evil still lives.
[3745.29s -> 3749.46s]  But now the Inquisition stands against it.
[3749.46s -> 3753.09s]  I can see the purifying flames...
[3753.09s -> 3754.09s]  Watch that cuff.
[3754.09s -> 3755.09s]  Watch that cuff.
[3755.09s -> 3758.09s]  ...I can see a future free of the devil.
[3758.09s -> 3759.84s]  Same year?
[3759.84s -> 3760.84s]  The same year?
[3760.84s -> 3768.44s]  Bless you all.
[3768.44s -> 3770.44s]  Bioshock came out before this?
[3770.44s -> 3776.33s]  I don't know why I did that.
[3776.33s -> 3780.02s]  What brings you here, Templar Brothers?
[3780.02s -> 3782.32s]  Slade the Beast.
[3782.32s -> 3783.32s]  Slade the Beast.
[3783.32s -> 3787.40s]  Praise the Lord.
[3787.40s -> 3789.90s]  Your deed will be well remembered, Inquisition.
[3789.90s -> 3797.19s]  Please 100% play through Sneak King rather than one more minute of this.
[3797.19s -> 3798.19s]  Alright, fine.
[3798.19s -> 3799.19s]  We've lost an hour.
[3799.19s -> 3801.19s]  I got what I wanted out of this.
[3801.19s -> 3802.19s]  I thought it was fun.
[3802.19s -> 3804.19s]  But it's time to put in...
[3804.19s -> 3805.19s]  The Inquisition.
[3805.19s -> 3806.19s]  Sneak King.
[3809.26s -> 3810.70s]  I thought it was fun.
[3810.70s -> 3812.83s]  Wait.
[3812.83s -> 3815.83s]  Follow Brother Lorenzo to find out more information about Marie's location.
[3815.83s -> 3816.83s]  Approach with caution.
[3816.83s -> 3818.83s]  Because getting too close will make him suspicious.
[3818.83s -> 3822.83s]  But don't fall too far behind or you'll lose him along with all the hopes of finding Marie.
[3824.20s -> 3827.82s]  Oh, it's a fucking escort quest.
[3831.88s -> 3839.97s]  We can't fail it.
[3841.97s -> 3847.10s]  It really is an Assassin's Creed walk behind the guy mission.
[3847.10s -> 3850.07s]  Stop, please.
[3850.07s -> 3851.07s]  But wait.
[3851.07s -> 3852.07s]  I need to see what happens.
[3862.08s -> 3863.08s]  Alright, fine.
[3863.08s -> 3864.08s]  Fine, fine, fine, fine.
[3864.08s -> 3870.12s]  I'll stop.
[3870.12s -> 3871.12s]  Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[3871.12s -> 3874.30s]  I just want to see what happens if he gets really annoyed.
[3874.30s -> 3879.84s]  Like, if I click on him enough times, is he going to do a funny response?
[3879.84s -> 3881.84s]  Or he makes like a fart noise and goes like,
[3881.84s -> 3882.84s]  Oh, sorry.
[3882.84s -> 3883.84s]  That was me.
[3883.84s -> 3884.84s]  Stop.
[3884.84s -> 3885.84s]  Stop it.
[3885.84s -> 3886.84s]  Get out of here.
[3886.84s -> 3887.84s]  Leave me alone.
[3887.84s -> 3888.84s]  You're annoying.
[3888.84s -> 3889.84s]  Hello?
[3889.84s -> 3890.84s]  Can I help you?
[3890.84s -> 3891.84s]  Praise God.
[3891.84s -> 3904.34s]  Alright.
[3904.34s -> 3905.34s]  Alright, alright, alright.
[3905.34s -> 3906.34s]  Okay, okay, okay.
[3906.34s -> 3907.34s]  Okay.
[3907.34s -> 3912.10s]  Listen, you're hearing the, you heard the case open.
[3912.10s -> 3914.98s]  This is the Sneak King CD.
[3914.98s -> 3915.98s]  It's about to go in.
[3915.98s -> 3922.21s]  Here we go.
[3922.21s -> 3926.26s]  Is this synced up?
[3926.26s -> 3927.26s]  Is the audio synced up?
[3927.26s -> 3928.26s]  I didn't really get a chance to see that.
[3928.26s -> 3930.78s]  Don't lie to me.
[3930.78s -> 3931.78s]  I want to make sure it looks good.
[3931.78s -> 3944.03s]  We'll fix it.
[3944.03s -> 3945.27s]  Is it?
[3945.27s -> 3946.27s]  Is it bad?
[3946.27s -> 3950.39s]  Tested it earlier.
[3950.39s -> 3953.39s]  Yeah, but people just say go because they don't want to wait like five minutes.
[3953.39s -> 3963.59s]  Alright.
[3963.59s -> 3964.59s]  When did this game come out?
[3964.59s -> 3969.01s]  You know, I know this game has been a meme.
[3969.01s -> 3973.18s]  It was a meme when it came out, but I never played it.
[3973.18s -> 3978.15s]  I don't, I have no idea what this game, I know you like sneak around in like trash cans
[3978.15s -> 3979.15s]  and stuff.
[3979.15s -> 3981.03s]  2006.
[3981.03s -> 3986.73s]  This is terrifying.
[3986.73s -> 3991.81s]  Remove the context of the Burger King.
[3991.81s -> 3995.81s]  This is a guy in a Burger King costume coming to kill everyone in this house.
[3995.81s -> 3998.20s]  You know what I mean?
[3998.20s -> 3999.20s]  Like it's just a costume.
[3999.20s -> 4019.86s]  How long is this intro?
[4019.86s -> 4028.86s]  Sneak King.
[4028.86s -> 4036.22s]  This is on FMV, right?
[4036.22s -> 4038.22s]  Display view cones.
[4038.22s -> 4040.22s]  Play in the sneaking suit.
[4040.22s -> 4043.30s]  Okay.
[4043.30s -> 4044.30s]  How to play.
[4044.30s -> 4045.86s]  Move.
[4045.86s -> 4046.86s]  This is first person mode.
[4046.86s -> 4047.86s]  Move camera.
[4047.86s -> 4048.86s]  Change zoom.
[4048.86s -> 4049.86s]  Surprise.
[4049.86s -> 4051.30s]  Flourish.
[4051.30s -> 4053.79s]  Hide and cancel and run.
[4053.79s -> 4056.74s]  Wait, this is 12 pages?
[4056.74s -> 4059.74s]  Use the stick to make the King sneak around.
[4059.74s -> 4060.74s]  Move the camera with R.
[4060.74s -> 4062.91s]  If controller settings have been switched.
[4062.91s -> 4064.15s]  Yeah, whatever.
[4064.15s -> 4066.15s]  In a challenge, hold the right trigger to run.
[4066.15s -> 4067.15s]  Just go.
[4067.15s -> 4068.15s]  Yeah, who cares?
[4068.15s -> 4074.53s]  Each time you deliver food, your chain count goes up.
[4074.53s -> 4076.53s]  This multiplies any score you earn.
[4076.53s -> 4078.53s]  If anyone spots you, you'll lose it all.
[4078.53s -> 4081.53s]  This will be extra sneaky when your chain count gets high.
[4081.53s -> 4085.62s]  Burger gear solid.
[4085.62s -> 4088.83s]  Burger.
[4088.83s -> 4090.01s]  Burger.
[4090.01s -> 4091.01s]  Burger.
[4091.01s -> 4092.44s]  Hey, then!
[4092.44s -> 4096.28s]  Thanks for the 10 community subs, yeah?
[4096.28s -> 4102.55s]  Missions zero and a 20.
[4102.55s -> 4104.55s]  Do I have to deliver food to people?
[4104.55s -> 4110.14s]  Sawmill challenge.
[4110.14s -> 4114.45s]  It's morning and you've got enormous omelet sandwiches to give away.
[4114.45s -> 4117.45s]  Make three deliveries to the hungry folks in the sawmill.
[4117.45s -> 4119.45s]  Consider this breakfast mission accomplished.
[4119.45s -> 4122.45s]  Press the A button to deliver food, but try not to be seen.
[4122.45s -> 4138.66s]  How am I supposed to deliver food to people if I can't be seen?
[4138.66s -> 4139.66s]  I can't deliver food.
[4141.29s -> 4144.29s]  I'm like fucking Fortnite taunting this guy.
[4144.29s -> 4146.29s]  How do I deliver food to him?
[4146.29s -> 4147.29s]  Delivery zero.
[4147.29s -> 4153.37s]  How do I deliver food?
[4153.37s -> 4168.88s]  Where's the gun?
[4168.88s -> 4174.77s]  How do I deliver food to people?
[4174.77s -> 4179.44s]  Oh, that person wants a hamburger.
[4179.44s -> 4184.78s]  Okay, that person.
[4184.78s -> 4185.78s]  Just give them food.
[4185.78s -> 4193.65s]  Why do I have to do this?
[4193.65s -> 4195.65s]  If people ordered food, why wouldn't they just want it?
[4195.65s -> 4206.91s]  Was this game free?
[4206.91s -> 4213.89s]  All right, so sneak up behind everybody.
[4213.89s -> 4219.06s]  And then surprise them with a delicious six-out-of-ten whopper,
[4219.06s -> 4220.06s]  because that's what it is.
[4220.06s -> 4233.08s]  Sawmill.
[4233.08s -> 4235.08s]  Oh, wait, I can interact with this.
[4239.43s -> 4241.43s]  His head just gets fucking sliced off.
[4241.43s -> 4244.61s]  I just jumped into the sawmill.
[4244.61s -> 4249.75s]  Wait.
[4249.75s -> 4251.75s]  Come on, somebody come over here.
[4251.75s -> 4262.61s]  You don't feed everybody, only the ones who want burgers.
[4262.61s -> 4275.28s]  Oh, are they just people on the minimap?
[4275.28s -> 4278.99s]  I don't know why I just asked if it was fall damage.
[4278.99s -> 4279.99s]  I was about to say, is there fall damage?
[4279.99s -> 4281.99s]  This person wants a burger, right?
[4281.99s -> 4291.26s]  Oh, somebody wants one over here.
[4291.26s -> 4292.26s]  I see it on the minimap.
[4292.26s -> 4295.78s]  I have to find the person that wants one on the minimap
[4295.78s -> 4312.14s]  and then go sneak to them.
[4312.14s -> 4313.14s]  That guy doesn't want it anymore.
[4313.14s -> 4314.14s]  God damn it.
[4314.14s -> 4315.14s]  All right, I get it.
[4315.14s -> 4316.14s]  I get it.
[4316.14s -> 4318.14s]  Everyone told me to skip the tutorial.
[4318.14s -> 4329.87s]  Flourish.
[4329.87s -> 4336.72s]  Okay, is that one?
[4336.72s -> 4338.72s]  I want to, like, hide in the saw machine and scare somebody.
[4338.72s -> 4341.72s]  Why would you scare, like, a sawmill employee?
[4341.72s -> 4346.11s]  That seems like the dumbest thing you could possibly do.
[4346.11s -> 4354.84s]  New missions have been unlocked.
[4354.84s -> 4355.84s]  Okay, well, I get it.
[4355.84s -> 4362.14s]  Let's see.
[4362.14s -> 4363.14s]  Doesn't matter.
[4363.14s -> 4364.14s]  All right, let's keep going.
[4364.14s -> 4366.66s]  Now what?
[4366.66s -> 4370.54s]  Wait, did I not get a good enough score?
[4370.54s -> 4373.71s]  This morning you got into rank C.
[4373.71s -> 4374.71s]  No, decline.
[4374.71s -> 4380.28s]  Handing over hash browns is enough.
[4380.28s -> 4381.28s]  You've got style.
[4381.28s -> 4382.28s]  Why not use it to deliver a serving of hash browns
[4382.28s -> 4383.28s]  with the flourish?
[4383.28s -> 4385.61s]  Okay.
[4385.61s -> 4397.98s]  I did it.
[4397.98s -> 4407.31s]  Wait, is this one map?
[4407.31s -> 4408.31s]  Is it just one map?
[4408.31s -> 4413.41s]  This game had to, this game came free
[4413.41s -> 4416.35s]  in Burger King Happy Meals or whatever they were.
[4416.35s -> 4420.36s]  A true Sneaking would never keep the buttery goodness
[4420.36s -> 4423.36s]  of those croissant witches to himself.
[4423.36s -> 4425.36s]  He delivered these to three hungry citizens
[4425.36s -> 4429.50s]  as fast as possible, and he'd do it in style
[4429.50s -> 4431.50s]  without touching any blue vision zones.
[4431.50s -> 4439.79s]  I thought there were arrows coming out of his, like, crotch,
[4439.79s -> 4441.79s]  like somebody shot him twice with arrows.
[4441.79s -> 4443.79s]  I was like, who fucking gutted this guy with arrows?
[4443.79s -> 4450.26s]  All right, who's hungry?
[4450.26s -> 4453.16s]  This game was four bucks.
[4453.16s -> 4454.16s]  Did they, where did they sell it?
[4454.16s -> 4456.16s]  Did they sell it at Burger King?
[4456.16s -> 4459.74s]  How could you, where did you buy this game?
[4459.74s -> 4464.86s]  Oh, look at me.
[4464.86s -> 4467.90s]  You did?
[4467.90s -> 4473.87s]  I can't get spotted.
[4473.87s -> 4478.22s]  Somebody's hungry over here.
[4478.22s -> 4484.90s]  Is that guy still hungry?
[4484.90s -> 4487.10s]  That person's hungry.
[4487.10s -> 4493.70s]  What happened?
[4493.70s -> 4502.23s]  Oh shit, they're coming this way.
[4502.23s -> 4503.73s]  I need to, I need to dump a body in here.
[4503.73s -> 4505.73s]  Wait, won't they just see me?
[4505.73s -> 4509.89s]  Wouldn't you just see this person?
[4509.89s -> 4519.70s]  Everyone's so hungry.
[4519.70s -> 4521.70s]  I'm not doing my job.
[4521.70s -> 4534.49s]  Over here, come on.
[4534.49s -> 4536.75s]  Watch out.
[4536.75s -> 4537.75s]  Get away, go away, go away.
[4537.75s -> 4538.75s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[4538.75s -> 4540.75s]  come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here,
[4540.75s -> 4550.03s]  come here, come here, come here come, come here, come here, come on
[4550.03s -> 4551.03s]  Please play the next game.
[4551.03s -> 4553.10s]  The next game is going to,
[4553.10s -> 4558.74s]  It's gonna I'm gonna half I'm gonna tell you guys the next game is gonna be very very hard to get me away from
[4559.02s -> 4561.81s]  The next game is gonna be impossible for us to move on
[4562.15s -> 4566.00s]  I'm actually probably gonna play it last cuz I'm terrified that I'm gonna stay there forever
[4566.48s -> 4583.10s]  And I get this person this person coming around the side here. Is there a time limit? I think there is no not too human
[4583.10s -> 4585.10s]  But holy shit, I should get it
[4585.46s -> 4597.28s]  Right here. Oh fuck. Oh
[4598.32s -> 4599.34s]  fuck
[4599.34s -> 4629.56s]  New missions have been unlocked. I told me this is bad too human is free since they can't legally sell it anymore
[4630.32s -> 4631.74s]  What?
[4631.74s -> 4649.52s]  They can't legally sell it free flourishes without being seen kind of curious if there's anything else in this game. Let's do this fast
[4650.00s -> 4662.93s]  The unreal engine lawsuit thing only they don't nobody sells it. Anyways, you'd be buying it secondhand no matter what you did
[4662.93s -> 4680.50s]  I got to cut this tree down. It's gonna kill that would hurt somebody you're gonna hurt someone
[4680.94s -> 4688.22s]  The person this person passed out from like being hungry
[4691.04s -> 4693.04s]  Walked on their body
[4702.70s -> 4704.70s]  People just dropping like flies
[4705.22s -> 4734.63s]  Not good enough. Why wait till everyone passes out? I just beat it
[4734.63s -> 4740.76s]  Oh was that when that one quote was not a quote wouldn't be quote, but that was quote not good enough
[4741.42s -> 4756.56s]  Sneak king. I think there's more than one location. I switched the goblin commander or are we are we done with this?
[4756.56s -> 4769.15s]  What do you think? That's what's next? I'm breaking the rule here
[4769.15s -> 4771.15s]  This has not been 30 minutes. It's been 20
[4771.75s -> 4786.70s]  deliver double the jolts by not only surprising some lucky sawmill worker with a stimulating cup of BK Joe coffee
[4787.16s -> 4789.72s]  But doing it from within a hiding place. Oh
[4790.87s -> 4793.47s]  Wow, next game, please. No, I
[4794.15s -> 4796.15s]  Got to deliver some BK Joe
[4796.55s -> 4811.43s]  Get away from me. His head is so big
[4811.95s -> 4823.86s]  Alright, here comes somebody I interest you in a cup of BK Joe. Just sit here until somebody's there. This game sucks next game
[4824.26s -> 4829.96s]  Just so wait a minute. I need to scare somebody into drinking coffee
[4830.60s -> 4839.13s]  This person's coming who human is a hundred percent free on Xbox live. Is it really I?
[4841.16s -> 4846.32s]  Maybe I should get it. Would you guys want to watch to human you you will for maybe like an hour?
[4846.92s -> 4856.33s]  All right. This is not a good place to be
[4859.69s -> 4861.21s]  Sneak King
[4861.21s -> 4873.42s]  Should I hide in the outhouse? I want to see other games. Yeah, I know me too
[4873.42s -> 4877.17s]  I feel like we're gonna play Goblin Commander for a while
[4877.73s -> 4884.00s]  Let's get this out of our system. So nobody tells me Ben begs me to go back to play Sneak King
[4884.52s -> 4899.28s]  Have this guy right here. No, they're gonna pass out before I get a chance. Come on. This is stupid a
[4906.56s -> 4910.10s]  Sneak King
[4910.10s -> 4916.51s]  Dropping like flies. Yeah, are you supposed to hide and do this if this happens?
[4917.15s -> 4926.40s]  Goblin come Goblin commander is an RTS. What it does not look like an RTS. It looks like a
[4927.12s -> 4936.67s]  Game you have a bunch of goblins go do things for you. No one's even come over here
[4936.71s -> 4937.83s]  This is stupid
[4937.83s -> 4944.94s]  Yes, this is Sneak King
[4944.94s -> 4952.68s]  Everybody remembers this very fondly for being hilarious and crazy and zany and comedy and memes
[4953.32s -> 4955.10s]  As you see
[4955.10s -> 4957.60s]  This is what this is it. This is it
[4958.04s -> 4962.81s]  It's not like that funny. It's not that like crazy and rare. It's just stupid
[4963.41s -> 4968.60s]  So all the people that you've heard talk about like, oh my god
[4968.60s -> 4971.20s]  Oh my god, what type of Burger King did this thing? Oh my god
[4971.20s -> 4976.00s]  Listen where they made an Xbox game where you snuck around as a king and gave him like frappuccinos and stuff
[4976.04s -> 4981.34s]  It was so ridiculous. It was the funniest ad campaign ever. Oh, this was dumb. This game sucks
[4981.88s -> 4987.15s]  Like this is what it was. This is what they were. This is what they were talking about
[4987.51s -> 5000.87s]  Wait, who said that?
[5000.91s -> 5001.95s]  I don't know
[5001.95s -> 5005.91s]  We're making up a straw man to knock it down and can make what and be you know
[5005.91s -> 5010.31s]  Annoyed at a person that might not even exist. Welcome to the world. Welcome to 2021
[5010.83s -> 5025.70s]  I'm very angry at a theoretical person
[5026.34s -> 5040.40s]  This person could exist. I don't know. Maybe I like the previous game
[5040.48s -> 5044.80s]  I need to just do this, but if I don't beat the first level then I'll never hear the end of it
[5045.32s -> 5056.24s]  You're turning into Andy. No, no, you're turning into goofy. What did I come with me? Goofy? What do you mean?
[5056.68s -> 5065.33s]  Takes an hour to beat the first level
[5065.97s -> 5077.04s]  No, what? Okay. Well, this is the only time I'm ever gonna play this. I didn't get it when Burger King put it out
[5077.04s -> 5079.04s]  I didn't play it now. I
[5079.64s -> 5084.92s]  Don't want to miss out on the fun. I don't want to have to remember
[5085.64s -> 5090.64s]  This game ever again. I don't want to slow down. Don't do it. Don't get into that
[5091.16s -> 5102.84s]  How am I supposed to do this? Where can I hide till I get somebody? No, there's only one person that walks in the path of a
[5103.64s -> 5105.08s]  What about over here?
[5105.08s -> 5114.42s]  Finish this game for 200 million off the debt. That's not worth it to me because sure
[5114.42s -> 5117.46s]  I could finish the game and get 200 million off the debt, but
[5118.98s -> 5124.30s]  You will that this is gonna get nominated for worst stream if I play sneaking for like another four hours
[5125.02s -> 5137.00s]  This will be nominated for worst stream of the year. So like what am I gonna do? That's not enough. There we go. It already is
[5139.02s -> 5140.35s]  Oh
[5140.35s -> 5143.39s]  We say funny things we think we say things that are funny, don't we?
[5144.03s -> 5165.90s]  Look at how funny the funny things we say are right. We do a little trolling here
[5168.50s -> 5171.38s]  Just me the streamer and my like army of trolls
[5175.10s -> 5179.36s]  Seething. All right. I'm done. I don't want to play this anymore. This game's not good
[5179.92s -> 5184.80s]  Hey, you're just a man. All right, we're gonna make up a bunch of people in a room
[5184.96s -> 5187.32s]  We're gonna make them up because that's what we're doing right now
[5187.80s -> 5191.12s]  See like I just see like five or six people sitting around on a couch
[5191.80s -> 5199.84s]  They all have big large Burger King drinks like big like super size like 40 ounce drinks fountain drinks
[5200.48s -> 5203.52s]  And this is like they've already eaten the Burger King food
[5204.16s -> 5207.05s]  they're just laughing hysterically and like
[5207.29s -> 5213.23s]  This crack is like six or seven people on this couch and every time you jump out and do like the dance you hear like
[5216.69s -> 5218.69s]  And then like
[5219.05s -> 5224.81s]  They're all at the end of their drinks because they've drank almost a large fucking coke all of them and they all think it's so funny
[5224.81s -> 5231.88s]  I just keep seeing them laughing at this and it's making me angry
[5232.52s -> 5237.72s]  At a bridge
[5237.72s -> 5251.66s]  Here's your chance to elevate your sneaking to an art form worthy of that of robe and crown
[5251.86s -> 5257.06s]  Live for five of these enormous omelette sandwiches without being seen or hurt really pushing the omelette sandwich
[5257.50s -> 5260.91s]  Which may be the grossest thing on the whole menu? So
[5261.92s -> 5266.04s]  They that omelette sandwich omelette sandwich omelette sandwich. It's terrible
[5266.04s -> 5267.20s]  It's the worst thing on the menu
[5267.20s -> 5275.27s]  They must have had a stockpile of like 600 million of these that they had to really get rid of these were terrible
[5275.69s -> 5280.88s]  What was the what was I don't even know what the thing was?
[5281.40s -> 5286.49s]  This would be a good game if it was an RPG. Oh
[5287.01s -> 5296.21s]  I'm a headache. I don't know the Kings got like a big migraines like not based anti-corporation streamer
[5302.57s -> 5313.58s]  Anti-corporation yeah, you guys can trust me. You guys can trust me. I'm an anti-corporation streamer. Trust me
[5314.42s -> 5316.56s]  How does it make see me what?
[5316.56s -> 5336.27s]  based corporate pill
[5336.91s -> 5345.37s]  How does that even mean trying to figure out that means? All right, I need to do this. I'm stuck in this stupid game
[5346.17s -> 5353.71s]  Everybody laughs. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. All right. It's time to make everybody that comes to the channel
[5353.71s -> 5362.76s]  That's new. I think this is like the worst like fucking cringe community ever. Okay, we have you have to play along
[5362.76s -> 5366.12s]  We have to make it so any time I do the king dance
[5366.12s -> 5369.56s]  We all laugh really hard and we didn't like just do you don't have to laugh that hard
[5369.84s -> 5371.96s]  Don't give don't make it that obvious
[5371.96s -> 5377.42s]  Just do omega lows make sure it's like all omega lows and then we'll go back to normal, right?
[5377.74s -> 5380.60s]  Like we have to be like, oh my god, I love that dance
[5380.60s -> 5382.60s]  We don't do it like five or six times in a row
[5382.76s -> 5392.36s]  Okay, we have to make people think that we think this is really funny then they never come back. Are you ready?
[5392.88s -> 5395.16s]  Don't do it now. You'd fucking it up stuff
[5395.72s -> 5398.51s]  No, you do it reusing the joke
[5399.03s -> 5404.87s]  It's not reusing a joke. It's I love this routine. Okay, I'm gonna do this routine whenever I'm able to I
[5406.48s -> 5412.00s]  Love the like get ten people to think that this whole community is fucking crazy
[5414.48s -> 5418.20s]  Stop doing it. You're doing it wrong. Just wait. Come on. You guys are way better than this
[5418.72s -> 5425.68s]  Just wait. Yeah, like just wait
[5426.52s -> 5433.48s]  We already are it no, but like they don't they don't know that right away
[5433.48s -> 5438.24s]  It takes about a year being here in this community before you figure out. Holy shit. We're all like nuts. I
[5438.84s -> 5443.37s]  Don't want them to have to wait that long
[5443.73s -> 5451.00s]  Is this like links house? Where am I?
[5455.09s -> 5458.05s]  Imagine if I just grab this guy by the shirt and pull him off like hitman
[5458.89s -> 5467.71s]  Stop no, it don't I I'm you have to wait till I get into character. I'm not in character yet. You're blowing it
[5468.23s -> 5470.60s]  It's only when I do the dance and then that's it
[5470.84s -> 5478.08s]  Just wait till I do the day it's when I do the the arm up dance
[5478.08s -> 5483.84s]  Everyone has to do it and then stop let's kick this lady. I here we go. Go go go go go go go go go go one
[5483.84s -> 5485.12s]  two three, oh
[5485.12s -> 5488.81s]  my god
[5488.81s -> 5494.11s]  Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. I
[5494.51s -> 5496.83s]  Completely forgot about this game. Oh no
[5497.03s -> 5499.62s]  Oh
[5499.62s -> 5500.74s]  crap
[5500.74s -> 5506.85s]  Got me and my buddies would sit on the couch right when this came out. It was so much fun
[5506.85s -> 5510.24s]  I remember we would just sit on the couch. It was like five or six of us
[5510.24s -> 5512.92s]  But we would just laugh at this shit. The king is so funny
[5514.57s -> 5516.57s]  It's so funny
[5516.77s -> 5525.00s]  What should I do? Should I hide like in the leaves? I wonder if I can I get somebody like this? What the heck was that? Oh
[5528.50s -> 5536.66s]  Somebody's coming somebody's coming. So he's coming. It's so funny. What happened to that guy?
[5540.94s -> 5544.34s]  Like I get like you're seriously barely could say that I know it's coming too
[5544.98s -> 5551.71s]  This is so classic. I love it. This is like classic 90s comedy
[5552.21s -> 5555.60s]  Okay, here we go. It's gonna happen again
[5556.00s -> 5571.98s]  Look at that stupid dance. I love those two. That's like my favorite item. This is the omelet. Here comes a two in a row
[5580.74s -> 5584.82s]  That's two in a row but that seriously is like probably my favorite sandwich
[5585.18s -> 5593.52s]  I wish I would bring that back bring back the omelet sandwich. Everybody loved it. It's been at least me and my friends did
[5594.28s -> 5599.16s]  We would order it me like me and like four or five us we'd go to the drive-thru and it'd be like hey
[5599.36s -> 5602.00s]  Bros, what are we getting and at the same time?
[5602.00s -> 5607.50s]  We would all kind of side eye each other and then after like three or four seconds, we'd go omelet sandwich and we'd pull in
[5608.32s -> 5616.68s]  So funny, I love it. I'm gonna go this way. Oh
[5621.40s -> 5624.72s]  Nothing nothing beat that. Is everybody alright? Hopefully everyone gets up soon
[5625.24s -> 5633.49s]  Those are the days I did really was back in like the mid 90s like late 90s mid 90s
[5633.49s -> 5637.05s]  I wanted like the drive-thru with like your buddies and stuff. I
[5638.93s -> 5642.07s]  Missed that like yeah, you can't do that shit anymore. I mean
[5642.65s -> 5650.19s]  Like only only in like 1998 did you could you go to like a drive-thru like a Burger King drive-thru McDonald's drive-thru?
[5650.19s -> 5652.57s]  You can't like did nobody just keep you don't do that
[5653.27s -> 5655.27s]  They only did that back in like the 90s
[5655.79s -> 5659.50s]  How much better the toys were too?
[5659.54s -> 5664.40s]  It was so much better than they are now
[5664.68s -> 5676.11s]  We would trade I remember when I was younger. This is probably I don't know maybe like three or four years ago
[5676.79s -> 5679.87s]  Friends of ours that we would get the Happy Meals and stuff and we would look at each other
[5679.87s -> 5684.59s]  We'd side eye each other and be like who's trading who and sometimes we would get the same things
[5684.59s -> 5689.92s]  Like let's say it was like a Hot Wheels thing two of us three of us would get the same car
[5690.44s -> 5694.92s]  It'd be like oh shit RNG. We would all start laughing
[5694.92s -> 5698.42s]  Oh
[5703.20s -> 5704.96s]  It's so funny I
[5704.96s -> 5710.06s]  Should I should dress up as the king in my next dream and do that dance?
[5710.62s -> 5715.77s]  And like present you guys like a sandwich. I don't have to do two more. Oh
[5719.50s -> 5721.50s]  So hungry got it. Can I get two in a row?
[5722.38s -> 5732.43s]  That's my favorite part right there. He does like the knees
[5733.05s -> 5737.72s]  I'm sad that we're not gonna be able to see it again
[5738.52s -> 5741.44s]  After this mission and I get this guy. Oh
[5741.96s -> 5743.16s]  Oh
[5743.16s -> 5761.93s]  Crap I run. Oh, I just missed it. This game is hilarious
[5761.93s -> 5766.06s]  I know and people forgot about it people forgot this existed
[5766.54s -> 5769.76s]  I'm the only one that remembers me and my friends on the couch
[5770.20s -> 5775.56s]  This is the only people that know this exists. No one else does only us only my four friends
[5776.00s -> 5794.80s]  Sitting on the couch with our large cokes. I did it. I can't do it anymore. It's too much for me
[5794.88s -> 5804.18s]  Stop I have to stop stop doing this that was going on for a while too

[5822.95s -> 5827.52s]  Game. Oh my god. What a classic. That was so convincing
[5828.12s -> 5845.12s]  No, it wasn't at all. Actually, it was just it was so unconvincing that maybe it was convincing game books
[5846.28s -> 5849.19s]  HD it was concerning
[5849.51s -> 5860.56s]  All right. Hold on sometimes surprise and sneak ability on enough at those times

[5916.67s -> 5921.07s]  Now that was a real like that was a real joke that you would have heard
[5921.83s -> 5929.64s]  During that routine two minutes ago. I'm stuck in that routine. I think
[5942.82s -> 5946.18s]  Waiting to see I'm waiting to look over and see everybody laughing

[5976.76s -> 5996.98s]  I'm not a psychopath. Is that what you're talking about? There's no I frames there
[5996.98s -> 6012.99s]  So if you get stuck there when you get out somebody's next to you, you're gonna get caught. I got it. All right, I'm done

[6039.92s -> 6045.40s]  That's why I'm waiting to play that one last because I feel like if I play that one right now like I'll get stuck playing it
[6045.84s -> 6054.90s]  Guaranteed so you think sneak King will be?
[6055.50s -> 6062.49s]  Well, okay. So do you guys think burger King will still be a company in 50 years or a hundred years?
[6062.49s -> 6073.02s]  I think about that sometimes if you think about like the games that not the games that the companies in the places now
[6073.62s -> 6077.98s]  They're probably not gonna exist in a hundred plus years. I don't think so
[6080.19s -> 6091.63s]  Doesn't three. Oh my god, it'll be the only thing left to eat
[6098.94s -> 6100.46s]  Goblin commander

[7383.23s -> 7390.51s]  In the game. It was really fun like gold by smashing them where the boulders
[7397.76s -> 7399.84s]  No games aren't good. Only old games are good

[7487.87s -> 7492.50s]  Ratchet and clank. Yeah

[7655.28s -> 7657.60s]  I actually don't really like mac and cheese
[7658.16s -> 7659.76s]  But wait, I don't know
[7659.76s -> 7666.00s]  Mac and cheese is not mac and cheese. It's mac and cheese like this. It's like mac n
[7666.78s -> 7672.30s]  Apostrophe cheese, but I don't really eat it dungeons and dragons don't really like that
[7672.38s -> 7678.02s]  I'm not a big fan of that game simpsons hit and run don't no that doesn't that's that's not accurate

[7682.58s -> 7687.44s]  Is like a thing happening a hit and run is like it's an action

[7735.65s -> 7752.21s]  That game's not fun. I played it because we're we had a timer tim and eric. Oh shit. There you go
[7753.42s -> 7760.54s]  Yeah, that's right. But wait a minute tim and eric the title of that show
[7761.20s -> 7768.77s]  Was tim and eric awesome show great job. It wasn't the show was not called tim and eric. It was tim and eric
[7769.25s -> 7776.06s]  Awesome show great job wallace and grommet. I didn't really watch it. I didn't really care for it
[7776.30s -> 7780.06s]  I thought it was like cool, but I didn't watch it because it was two characters with an and in the middle
[7782.56s -> 7787.04s]  Sex and the city. No. Yeah, didn't watch that fucking show either didn't care about it at all

[7799.58s -> 7801.58s]  And stimpy it was ren
[7802.12s -> 7810.29s]  Ampersand stimpy completely different. I would watch that show a thousand times. It's not rick ampersand morty
[7810.37s -> 7824.40s]  It's rick and morty don't want to watch it. That like actually is weird how that's true for me
[7824.64s -> 7830.59s]  If it was if it was jack ampersand dexter, I might like care. Why is that weird?
[7830.59s -> 7841.66s]  That's weird. Why do I do that ed ed and eddie?
[7841.82s -> 7845.87s]  I didn't I did not watch that much of that show. I think I watched like two episodes
[7846.19s -> 7855.12s]  All right
[7855.12s -> 7857.60s]  I need to make new people because I lost everybody
[7857.76s -> 7866.16s]  Problems like the rock throw that are not available appear in cages to unlock a cage like the desire goblin using left
[7866.16s -> 7876.10s]  I'm seeing presented to one two, three, four five
[7877.58s -> 7884.46s]  Okay, plenty of miners. Let's go. All right. I got ten units now hate conjunctions and english grammar
[7884.70s -> 7906.54s]  I mean, I it's just a weird thing rocket and ratchet ampersand clank. Don't do the same thing. I just did please
[7906.54s -> 7908.54s]  What are you doing? Please? Don't do that. What am I doing?
[7909.18s -> 7918.18s]  run away
[7918.18s -> 7925.33s]  Alvin and hubs. Oh shit soul fountains provide souls to the clan of its owner
[7925.73s -> 7929.73s]  Capture a soul fountain dispatch all enemies in the immediate area position your clan next to it for a time
[7929.97s -> 7932.66s]  When capture the souls that are released will turn from red to blue
[7933.22s -> 7945.71s]  Okay, so are they gonna get it? They're lying to everyone. I'm really not though character's name and character's name
[7946.11s -> 7961.73s]  It's just it was like a turn off for me all through my life. We get it destroy the blade worms
[7961.81s -> 7965.34s]  How am I gonna do that? I have to actually go kill those things
[7969.87s -> 7974.35s]  Dunk and donuts dunking and don't it's not dunking and donuts. It's dunking donuts
[7975.50s -> 7983.73s]  Like you're dunking your donut in the coffee dunk in donuts not dunk and donuts world and warcraft
[7983.89s -> 7994.06s]  No, that's wrong too bill and ted i've never seen that for i've never seen that movie start to finish ever
[8001.09s -> 8003.81s]  Hall of titans we must enlist a stone ogre to help with our work
[8003.97s -> 8012.32s]  I can have souls to enter the hall of titans and buy a stone
[8013.76s -> 8019.44s]  Ogre, how much do I need all of?
[8020.16s -> 8025.58s]  I have to do it. I'm only gonna do this one more time. I promise
[8030.66s -> 8033.25s]  No, i'm not gonna do it
[8033.25s -> 8039.06s]  Each clan will have one titan and one turret associated with it available in the hall of titans to buy a titan
[8039.55s -> 8042.19s]  Select the desired unit using the left thumb stick
[8043.01s -> 8049.49s]  When doing so the unit stats will be displayed at the bottom right of the screen cool. Yeah, they cost resources
[8049.49s -> 8053.81s]  We all know that all right. I have a ogre
[8061.23s -> 8069.38s]  Attack and titan stewie and brian. It's not the name of his show. That's the name of two characters
[8071.90s -> 8080.29s]  Lord and the rings. Okay, would it be as popular as a series if it was called lord and the rings?
[8081.23s -> 8091.92s]  I don't think so. All right, we're gonna go break this clear the debris and collect 125 gold
[8094.34s -> 8098.08s]  That still dramatically makes sense by the way lord and the rings
[8098.48s -> 8111.68s]  What about what about germa and stir that wasn't the name of our youtube channel?
[8113.34s -> 8115.34s]  We just played a lot of stuff together
[8123.73s -> 8125.25s]  Let's see. That's a lot of money
[8125.25s -> 8134.59s]  light and magic harry potter and the philosopher's stone
[8135.07s -> 8137.12s]  No, i'm sorry
[8137.12s -> 8141.60s]  the name of that the name of that series is not harry potter and ron weasley
[8142.62s -> 8143.50s]  and

[8167.15s -> 8171.63s]  I don't want to read any more of these. I told you my theory and it's that's it

[8315.78s -> 8331.28s]  Derma and sucks. Yeah star wars would have sucked. Nobody would have gone to the theater if it was called
[8331.84s -> 8333.84s]  luke and darth vader
[8334.16s -> 8336.16s]  You none of you would have seen the movie
[8337.86s -> 8357.74s]  No one would have seen the movie. I'm telling you. I don't think those critters will be showing their thorny hides around here anytime soon
[8358.67s -> 8377.17s]  Great job gay and silent bob never watched it. I've not seen that movie
[8385.82s -> 8387.26s]  What the
[8387.26s -> 8388.70s]  natarse
[8388.70s -> 8390.14s]  great frocks
[8390.64s -> 8392.48s]  It's gonna be another titan
[8392.48s -> 8399.55s]  I hope and then I can do my armin voice at least another three times before I have to retire it forever because everybody hates it
[8416.11s -> 8420.38s]  What's next rescue the three trapped workers, let's go
[8422.88s -> 8426.00s]  This game is actually really fun. I could see what people would play this a lot
[8427.10s -> 8431.66s]  But we're about to be done in like the next I don't know. Yeah, 30 20 minutes 30 minutes. I don't know
[8431.66s -> 8433.66s]  I'm still enjoying it. I think it's cool
[8444.46s -> 8446.46s]  King in the hill it's king of the hill
[8447.87s -> 8449.87s]  Suicide seen many episodes of that show
[8453.10s -> 8455.10s]  Yeah, can I eat the big plant?
[8457.55s -> 8466.24s]  Nice. All right, we got one
[8466.24s -> 8470.29s]  alvin and the chipmunks
[8470.29s -> 8472.29s]  Yes, and that that is one of the most
[8473.01s -> 8474.19s]  awful
[8474.19s -> 8481.62s]  Franchises ever all the new mood like you are you trying to tell me to go see alvin and the chipmunks and you're even that's not
[8481.62s -> 8486.37s]  Even right you have it wrong again. It's not alvin and theodore
[8487.09s -> 8490.05s]  Or alvin and simon it's alvin and the chipmunks
[8491.46s -> 8495.06s]  But that doesn't we didn't have to talk about that because that whole franchise is dog shit
[8495.22s -> 8505.62s]  We don't even need to talk about it that right off the bat. It's just a non watch
[8506.18s -> 8521.02s]  How much off the deck for you to get an alvin and the chipmunks tattoo?
[8526.19s -> 8530.99s]  It would take okay, i'll be honest with you i'm gonna be very honest with you. Let me be honest fine
[8531.31s -> 8534.83s]  Here's how what that would take for me to get an alvin and the chipmunks tattoo
[8535.15s -> 8538.91s]  And we're talking the 3d alvin and the chipmunks, which is way worse
[8539.86s -> 8544.26s]  The like alvin and the chipmunks from like the fucking 40s or whatever it was like the 60s
[8544.26s -> 8546.02s]  I don't even know when they first came out
[8546.02s -> 8551.54s]  That old style. Okay, cool. It's like i'd be like getting snap crackle pop tattooed on you
[8551.70s -> 8555.86s]  It's like, oh, all right. Well, it's kind of weird but like oh, whatever. It's like old. I guess it's like an old thing
[8556.34s -> 8558.73s]  getting the 3d
[8558.73s -> 8564.03s]  Reimagination of those characters tattooed on my body. It would it would cost a million dollars
[8564.67s -> 8567.31s]  I would need one million dollars taxed
[8568.21s -> 8572.85s]  Taxed one million not one million one million taxed already
[8573.25s -> 8575.81s]  So that would be like 1.4 million 1.5 million
[8578.51s -> 8584.38s]  It has to be taxed
[8584.38s -> 8592.51s]  That's what it would take deal. Okay. No, no deal. I'm not agreeing to it
[8594.16s -> 8599.20s]  A face tattoo of it. No, I would no not happening. There's no amount of money that would make me get a face tattoo
[8600.38s -> 8610.66s]  No amount set up a crowdfunding. We'll get it to 1.4 million. No, you will not that's a fucking absolute not it would never happen
[8611.14s -> 8619.38s]  That would never happen. It would never happen. I am so convinced that that would never hit 1.4 million
[8626.69s -> 8630.21s]  It has to go on my back like on my lower back
[8631.25s -> 8632.45s]  No way
[8632.45s -> 8634.45s]  No fucking way
[8642.18s -> 8646.42s]  That's not even worth one point what's not even worth one million taxed by the way
[8646.50s -> 8652.62s]  Right
[8653.50s -> 8658.66s]  And it would have to be that image that's on all the posters
[8659.38s -> 8663.90s]  Where you got like theodore on the left arms crossed leaning back
[8664.70s -> 8670.94s]  Simon on the right arms crossed leaning back and alvin in the middle arms crossed leaning back with sunglasses on
[8672.70s -> 8679.62s]  3d the 3d characters. That's I would need 1.4 million dollars to do that
[8687.58s -> 8692.32s]  What about waldo simbromet
[8693.28s -> 8696.99s]  That probably wouldn't be a million. I don't think I would need a million for that. They're like cool
[8698.85s -> 8700.61s]  That's like classic
[8700.61s -> 8707.25s]  Characters alvin and chipmunk are classic characters, but they're classic like money grab characters like they're like the smurfs
[8716.21s -> 8719.65s]  They brought back all these new franchises to try to like make them for kids
[8720.29s -> 8722.72s]  These are
[8723.60s -> 8727.28s]  Wallace and grommet is timeless. You don't need to like remake wallace and grommet to
[8727.92s -> 8730.24s]  Cater to like a 10 year old right now
[8731.20s -> 8732.72s]  You just make another wallace and grommet
[8732.72s -> 8735.92s]  You don't have to like remake then redesign them and bring the back for kids now
[8736.32s -> 8740.40s]  No, you just make another wallace and grommet. It's a timeless character. I would do that for fucking probably. I don't know
[8741.78s -> 8743.30s]  In that same spot
[8743.30s -> 8763.60s]  I have that 500k taxed. It's a stone crusher clan try also grab it holds up way more than it should
[8764.24s -> 8770.76s]  Why it's it's that's cool. It's really cool. It's claymation. First of all, it's really well done claymation
[8771.46s -> 8777.10s]  The characters are funny. It's like an old like man and his funny dog and they go eat like cheese from the moon and stuff
[8777.10s -> 8779.87s]  It's like that's timeless
[8779.87s -> 8785.15s]  Going to the moon to try the the planet's surface because you think it's cheese
[8785.79s -> 8788.03s]  And watching him spread it on the cracker and eat it
[8789.06s -> 8796.34s]  I wanted to eat it so bad when I was younger watching him take that gray chunk of that cheese moon shit and
[8796.82s -> 8800.10s]  Biting it. Oh my god. I wanted it so bad. I wanted to eat that so bad
[8800.42s -> 8808.34s]  I don't have that reaction when I watch alvin and the chipmunks
[8811.36s -> 8821.02s]  Lost at sea whatever the new movie was. I don't know. I want better uh better moves
[8821.74s -> 8830.66s]  Same and I don't even like cheese. Yeah, all right. What am I doing? Make contact with the hellfire clan
[8835.54s -> 8839.74s]  Chip wrecked the name of the movie was chip wrecked
[8843.07s -> 8851.28s]  That might be worse than putting two characters with and in the middle. In fact, it's absolutely it is. I need resources
[8856.66s -> 8862.10s]  Hellfire clan attacking they really they're they're rallying around the soul fountain after that soul
[8864.82s -> 8870.26s]  I need the tattoo fundraiser link
[8871.38s -> 8874.40s]  That's not how this works
[8874.40s -> 8882.72s]  It's not you guys make a fundraiser. No, it would be I would have to have an official an official account an official kickstarter campaign
[8883.04s -> 8888.02s]  Or official campaign onto my account name to do it
[8889.34s -> 8893.18s]  You know if somebody makes an account if somebody links you i'm gonna make this really clear
[8893.42s -> 8895.42s]  If someone links you an image
[8895.42s -> 8902.94s]  Not an image if somebody links you a link to a like fund page of me getting a alvin and the chipmunks ass tattoo
[8903.50s -> 8908.46s]  Whatever it was. It's not real. It's only real when I tell you it's mine
[8908.86s -> 8910.86s]  Do do not give any money to anybody
[8911.18s -> 8914.06s]  Don't give any money to anything
[8914.06s -> 8919.18s]  Only if I tell you it's my link and I link it and i'm the one that links it don't do that
[8920.03s -> 8929.49s]  Someone's gonna steal your money don't fuck around there's nothing to do with me and I am completely denouncing all of that
[8929.73s -> 8939.12s]  Don't do that. Don't fucking do it. I know one of you might think about it. I'll be furious if you do and I'd really mean that
[8941.54s -> 8947.22s]  I truly mean that if I do it you'll know
[8948.53s -> 8952.19s]  I'll have an official link in the channel. You'll know because I'll talk about it
[8952.19s -> 8960.75s]  I will say here is the link for the 1.4 million dollars to get a the alvin and chipmunks 3d
[8961.15s -> 8968.91s]  Ass tattoo or back tattoo here it is. You will only know that from me
[8975.42s -> 8979.66s]  I have to spend this much time on this. Do I have to really spend this much time here?
[8980.16s -> 8982.75s]  Why'd I have to spend this much time?
[8982.75s -> 8987.68s]  saying this
[8995.90s -> 9002.40s]  Huge omega lulls today, you're gonna sober up tomorrow and regret this bit
[9003.68s -> 9005.68s]  Fucking fine. I'm drinking water
[9006.40s -> 9008.40s]  Hellfire clans seek blood
[9010.08s -> 9013.36s]  I didn't agree to anything. I just told you if that ever were to happen
[9013.68s -> 9016.24s]  It would be coming from me and I have not agreed to that yet
[9016.72s -> 9030.94s]  All right, we gotta find the encampment. All right. I got a group here
[9032.59s -> 9035.55s]  Yet, I don't know him. I don't know what i'm gonna do
[9045.82s -> 9049.09s]  He's zonked get him
[9049.09s -> 9052.74s]  Okay, I find that I could find their lumber camp
[9053.06s -> 9061.44s]  And take it over
[9061.44s -> 9065.02s]  And then this game is actually pretty fun
[9066.08s -> 9068.56s]  Could you play this online with somebody if you could that's really cool
[9069.28s -> 9072.61s]  When he files for bankruptcy, he'll be back
[9073.58s -> 9075.10s]  To do that
[9075.10s -> 9079.74s]  Yeah, by the way, what's the um, how long do I have to do this? Like if let's say i'm retired
[9080.83s -> 9082.53s]  completely
[9082.53s -> 9084.53s]  Like five ten years go by
[9085.55s -> 9087.55s]  And like i'm like 50
[9088.42s -> 9090.26s]  i'm like 60
[9090.26s -> 9094.66s]  Can I come on twitter and say hey guys i'm opening up the uh,
[9095.22s -> 9099.94s]  The kickstarter for the alvin and the chipmunks 3d, uh back lower back tattoo
[9100.50s -> 9103.74s]  Please contribute here. Is that would you guys still do it?
[9105.81s -> 9109.73s]  No, what would happen realistically is that would get like two retweets
[9110.61s -> 9114.45s]  And like four likes on that tweet and there would be no replies
[9115.09s -> 9119.25s]  And no one would pay for and no one would do you guys aren't even they're not gonna be like on twitter anymore
[9119.49s -> 9127.90s]  It would be just a weird desperate attempt for me to like come back and just take money from people. It'd be weird
[9135.50s -> 9140.05s]  Get a time splitters tattoo
[9140.05s -> 9141.17s]  I don't
[9141.17s -> 9143.09s]  I'm not I don't have any tattoos
[9143.09s -> 9149.39s]  I told you guys the tattoo that I was gonna get a long time ago when I never did it and i'm kind of glad
[9149.47s -> 9150.67s]  I didn't
[9150.67s -> 9152.67s]  I was gonna get the venom symbol
[9153.31s -> 9154.41s]  on my
[9154.41s -> 9161.22s]  Shoulder and I swear to god something happens to your brain when you when you get like jacked
[9161.87s -> 9169.39s]  Like I was fucking huge. I was like 160 170 pounds and i'm like five eight. I was I was a inflated
[9169.95s -> 9173.39s]  Swole fucking massive person. I was huge and I was always lifting
[9173.79s -> 9177.39s]  I was really in shape when you get like that. It does something to your brain
[9178.46s -> 9183.74s]  I'm gonna get like the spider-man tattoo. I'm i'm spider-man like I really thought that I was like spider-man
[9184.22s -> 9186.86s]  Yeah, this is like what spider-man looks like i'm spider-man
[9187.18s -> 9190.88s]  I'm gonna get the venom tattoo because I've like looked like venom
[9192.00s -> 9192.72s]  I don't know what it does
[9192.72s -> 9197.04s]  It does something into like inside the chemistry in your brain and it makes you like think you're a superhero or something
[9197.52s -> 9201.94s]  So I was gonna get the venom symbol
[9202.18s -> 9208.98s]  Across the shoulder and like down around the back and around my arm and it would have looked sick
[9209.62s -> 9212.02s]  With like my shirt off like just jacked in the mirror
[9212.02s -> 9217.18s]  It would be this like like those lines and i'd be like fuck. Yeah, i'd be at the beach
[9217.97s -> 9223.33s]  It'd be like wow look at that. That guy's that guy's jacked and he has a venom tattoo that guy's venom
[9223.81s -> 9227.44s]  But I didn't want to be venom. I wanted to be I wanted to be venom suit spider-man
[9229.46s -> 9236.45s]  I didn't want to be venom. I wanted to be spider-man with the venom suit on but i'm glad I didn't
[9240.34s -> 9244.98s]  Because I've turned to the kind of i've gotten a little frumpy and that part of my brain turned off
[9246.32s -> 9248.32s]  I'm no longer like jacked spider-man
[9248.88s -> 9252.78s]  And i'd be like, oh shit, I have like I have like the superhero tattoo now
[9253.34s -> 9255.28s]  Maybe I wouldn't have stopped
[9255.28s -> 9258.64s]  Maybe that would have been enough motivation for me to not to like to get just to keep going to the gym
[9258.88s -> 9268.91s]  Maybe I fucked up maybe having the venom tattoo on the shoulder was what needed to be there
[9269.15s -> 9286.38s]  So I would continue to be spider-man in the venom suit. Oh, well, that's like getting a marijuana leaf tattooed on you
[9286.86s -> 9292.05s]  Because you like weed
[9292.05s -> 9294.05s]  Well
[9298.70s -> 9300.70s]  But why does anybody get a tattoo
[9301.02s -> 9303.50s]  Like what does anybody get like a tattoo like that?
[9304.45s -> 9307.73s]  It's because like you I don't know. It's like cool or it means something, right?
[9316.56s -> 9320.82s]  We tattoo for two million. That's not that's like not that big of a deal
[9329.70s -> 9332.98s]  You know a long time ago burger boy was gonna get wario tattooed on his ass
[9334.88s -> 9336.88s]  shooting a fireball like
[9336.96s -> 9338.96s]  To it like towards his like butt
[9339.20s -> 9342.38s]  I think that didn't happen
[9342.38s -> 9353.52s]  It would have been yeah, it would have been glorious
[9354.06s -> 9355.66s]  But that's the kind of tattoo that's like, okay
[9355.66s -> 9357.90s]  That's like funny and like wow about like an interesting
[9358.30s -> 9360.62s]  What an interesting person you may have you must have been right?
[9360.62s -> 9363.82s]  Like what a what a crazy cool fun life you may have had right?
[9364.46s -> 9368.06s]  Getting like the spider-man tattoo on your shoulder is like i'm jacked
[9372.27s -> 9373.79s]  In my brain at least
[9373.79s -> 9376.29s]  How much for a twitch tv tattoo?
[9376.53s -> 9383.20s]  What do you mean like the twitch like the whatever the glitchy the icon?
[9384.00s -> 9393.76s]  I'd rather get alvin than chipmunks. I would rather get alvin and the chipmunks for free
[9394.56s -> 9408.78s]  On the lower back then get a twitch.tv glitch tattoo for money. I don't know
[9410.32s -> 9412.32s]  I don't know something about that just sits weird to me
[9412.56s -> 9418.51s]  I don't know why like I just feel like I feel like that's a kind of
[9419.31s -> 9421.84s]  Oh, I beat it
[9421.84s -> 9423.84s]  Where would it be and how big does it have to be?
[9425.46s -> 9427.46s]  That the twitch glitch tattoo
[9427.94s -> 9429.78s]  How big does that have to be?
[9429.78s -> 9433.02s]  Because if it was small
[9433.02s -> 9437.52s]  Like if it was like a emote sized or something that would be kind of cute like get that like on like your
[9438.08s -> 9440.88s]  Like your wrist or something or on like your forearm like that's cute
[9440.96s -> 9450.99s]  I don't I don't have a problem with that. How big does it have to be huge?
[9453.12s -> 9460.69s]  No, I don't think i'd want to do it on your forehead. No
[9461.25s -> 9474.22s]  I wouldn't get any tattoo on my forehead. What happened? Oh head b oops
[9479.38s -> 9481.66s]  Oink oink boom
[9481.66s -> 9489.87s]  On your cheek
[9489.87s -> 9492.19s]  On your bald spot. I don't have a bald spot
[9497.57s -> 9500.13s]  Inner lip. Oh, no, I don't think so. No, thanks
[9506.70s -> 9512.14s]  Which url
[9513.66s -> 9515.58s]  No, I don't want that because that's not gonna be
[9517.50s -> 9521.58s]  That's a weird advertisement for something that's not gonna not gonna exist anymore mentally
[9528.83s -> 9531.58s]  Why don't you do that?
[9533.50s -> 9536.70s]  QR code tattoo and it links to rick roll
[9539.66s -> 9541.47s]  can't wait to
[9541.47s -> 9543.47s]  Do that a thousand times
[9543.55s -> 9547.52s]  All right. So now
[9547.52s -> 9549.52s]  Investigate the hellfire gunpowder factory
[9551.10s -> 9554.30s]  Not yet. I want one of these guys 140
[9555.10s -> 9556.30s]  All right
[9556.30s -> 9557.42s]  I'm gonna
[9557.42s -> 9559.81s]  I own this factory, right? Yeah
[9559.81s -> 9569.30s]  Oh, that's new
[9569.30s -> 9574.02s]  Medium melee. All right. That's good. That's a good group tons of health
[9574.58s -> 9585.25s]  Now let's go find it. What about a rat tattoo? Uh, that would be fun. I wouldn't be opposed to that
[9592.86s -> 9594.86s]  That's that does it for me. I think that's cool
[9601.44s -> 9613.17s]  What just happened I was laughing about chipwrecked can these guys eat?
[9618.86s -> 9628.05s]  I'm gonna get i'm gonna get i'm gonna get jack and dexter tattooed on my back
[9628.69s -> 9633.18s]  He's gonna be holding the chicken gun
[9633.82s -> 9651.42s]  This is the chainsaw sounds because I need more people. Hold on keep fighting
[9652.06s -> 9660.06s]  Everybody died
[9660.06s -> 9662.06s]  Oh, it's because the factory blew up
[9662.30s -> 9668.42s]  Homer simpson. Yes, i'll get okay homer simpson
[9669.70s -> 9673.50s]  Holding the pink donut standing straight up heels on the ground
[9673.74s -> 9678.86s]  Just standing in just a regular position with his arm up pink donut has a single bite out of it
[9679.73s -> 9681.97s]  Frosting side is facing the camera
[9681.97s -> 9696.59s]  And he has a little wad chew kind of in his mouth side of his mouth. That's pretty epic. Yeah
[9699.63s -> 9701.63s]  also the great tattoo and you're
[9706.22s -> 9710.72s]  My god like that's the kind of tattoo
[9711.60s -> 9718.11s]  That you just get up one day and you're like what the fuck is going on with my life?
[9718.19s -> 9720.27s]  What's happening to my what's going on?
[9724.43s -> 9726.86s]  right
[9726.86s -> 9741.02s]  Investigate the gunpowder factory. Okay, let's go back to sneak king
[9741.02s -> 9742.62s]  We're gonna move on to the next game
[9742.62s -> 9745.02s]  And the next game is gonna lock me there for a long time
[9745.10s -> 9750.22s]  And I think half of you are gonna be very excited and the other half are gonna be very pissed off that it's I even
[9750.38s -> 9753.28s]  Picked it in the first place
[9753.28s -> 9755.28s]  I guarantee
[9756.06s -> 9761.52s]  100 guarantee this game will be played for at least a full hour. I guarantee it
[9764.19s -> 9769.68s]  It's guaranteed
[9769.68s -> 9772.32s]  Somebody's still fighting back here. Wait. Hey, that's mine. Give me that
[9774.86s -> 9776.38s]  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa
[9776.38s -> 9784.46s]  Can't see anything. It's not skylanders
[9785.02s -> 9793.63s]  Don't you guys feel like skylanders was like five years a little too early?
[9799.34s -> 9808.06s]  Just barely I still have that right? I think so don't have it
[9811.88s -> 9821.36s]  140 almost can get the uh the ogre like if they had just waited for technology to get just a little bit better even
[9822.08s -> 9826.37s]  It probably would have been a thousand times more popular than it is now, but then it was
[9826.85s -> 9836.78s]  We'll give me that
[9836.78s -> 9839.66s]  It's you have to claim sponsorship money. That's what we're gonna watch
[9841.42s -> 9846.88s]  Um, no, all right, bring on the big guy
[9851.09s -> 9856.64s]  I'm not fucking around anymore. Let's go
[9856.64s -> 9863.02s]  Game part of it sucked. I didn't play skylanders. I just knew what it was
[9863.74s -> 9866.06s]  I was like, oh, that's kind of interesting how that works
[9866.78s -> 9874.99s]  I can just eat people
[9874.99s -> 9879.02s]  Why play as any other character?
[9879.02s -> 9889.73s]  This is so much better
[9889.73s -> 9894.53s]  I lose health for eating these guys now
[9894.53s -> 9897.02s]  All right, you stay here and claim this
[9897.02s -> 9898.78s]  Can he claim this by himself?
[9900.90s -> 9907.95s]  Later levels get really hard to make kids spend money kind of weird to hear
[9911.01s -> 9912.13s]  Oh shit
[9912.13s -> 9924.70s]  All right, go get him. They dead wait. No, no, no, no, no, no, don't do this. I gotta get more troops
[9925.42s -> 9939.20s]  Upgrade their gear. What am I doing? Yeah, look at that. Now we're gonna take it over. When is the next game?
[9940.16s -> 9945.44s]  Um after my first break which will be in precisely after this level
[9946.24s -> 9951.04s]  I'm gonna go pee and come back and we're gonna move to the next game. The next game is gonna be wow
[9953.50s -> 9954.88s]  Really wonder
[9954.88s -> 9956.56s]  What the response will be?
[9956.56s -> 9961.47s]  Oh what they're already going over there shit. Hurry up
[9968.02s -> 9971.54s]  Eat eat them both. They'll take it over
[9971.94s -> 9977.14s]  This game's pretty fun. I could see how this would be really popular
[9977.78s -> 9984.86s]  I'm coming. I don't fit here
[9990.10s -> 9991.54s]  Wow, let's go
[9991.54s -> 9995.50s]  It's not world of warcraft. It's not an mmo
[9995.82s -> 10000.85s]  He's what you think I wouldn't you think I would do that to you right now?
[10003.34s -> 10007.42s]  Unlike the one stream you get a week. You think i'm gonna play world of warcraft for like two hours
[10008.06s -> 10014.66s]  All right, where's this gunpowder place?
[10020.82s -> 10024.50s]  Okay, I will make somebody i'm gonna make sure i'm gonna make everybody really really calm here
[10025.06s -> 10030.43s]  It's not league of legends. If you think it's league of legends and you're like goddamn it. It's probably league
[10030.83s -> 10034.35s]  He's gonna do a stupid joke where he plays league. He's like, oh once a week and he plays league
[10035.15s -> 10037.15s]  If league of legends shows up on this stream
[10039.34s -> 10044.46s]  I will get the alvin and the chipmunks 3d ass tattoo for free like immediately the next day
[10046.48s -> 10048.48s]  If you see league of legends
[10048.48s -> 10050.40s]  Show up on this stream
[10050.40s -> 10052.40s]  And what I mean by that is me
[10052.90s -> 10054.74s]  Playing league of legends
[10054.74s -> 10058.74s]  I'm playing it sitting there and oh, yeah league of legends. Cool. This is fun
[10058.74s -> 10062.34s]  I'm playing the game me streaming it not opening a video
[10063.12s -> 10069.76s]  Not talking about it. I mean physically sitting here playing league of legends on my twitch tv
[10069.76s -> 10074.78s]  Okay, here I am playing the game me if that happens
[10075.58s -> 10079.82s]  I will get the alvin and the chipmunks ass tattoo the next day. Now. Why is it always ass? It's like back
[10079.98s -> 10084.66s]  I keep saying ass
[10094.46s -> 10098.77s]  An ass tattoo perhaps there is another way
[10105.46s -> 10112.24s]  We still have not forgotten about three stooges in fortnight. It's gonna happen. It doesn't I could take a I could take five more years
[10112.32s -> 10123.09s]  It's gonna happen

[13465.31s -> 13467.15s]  Oh, no
[13467.15s -> 13472.59s]  What's the actual odds to get a royal flush? Isn't it like one in a hundred trillion? It's like impossible, isn't it?

[13587.69s -> 13589.69s]  It's there for entertainment value
[13591.69s -> 13594.81s]  When you go into a casino any money that is in your pocket
[13595.85s -> 13604.20s]  Is not coming back with you. That's how you should look at it. You are there to entertain yourself and maybe a group of friends
[13605.61s -> 13608.57s]  That's it
[13608.57s -> 13612.01s]  Whatever is in your pocket. You should assume right off the bat is not going to come home
[13613.04s -> 13621.80s]  At all. This is where the big plays happen right here. That's 18 bingo right off the bat done

[13626.46s -> 13627.66s]  There it is
[13627.66s -> 13632.94s]  This is where it begins
[13632.94s -> 13638.06s]  If you suck

[13690.52s -> 13699.53s]  This guy's not even trying to hide his cheating what do you mean hide?

[13727.64s -> 13730.36s]  Can I go back and get more money from the guy at the cashier?
[13734.46s -> 13737.74s]  Are you having fun?
[13737.74s -> 13739.74s]  Kind of because this is not real
[13739.98s -> 13743.10s]  And it's I guess it'd be kind of could be fun if it's not real

[14434.04s -> 14439.56s]  That you could bet ten dollars and it takes like four minutes five minutes to have whatever the outcome happens. It's very slow
[14440.20s -> 14445.08s]  The objective of the tournament is to be the player with the highest bank roll after the designated number of games
[14445.72s -> 14450.84s]  The winner receives four thousand dollars in the victory count stores winning a low level tournament bonus prize

[14457.45s -> 14460.49s]  You always do right? You always do the the the right in the middle here
[14461.13s -> 14470.92s]  You got to get the inside the corners put put 50 bucks here
[14471.64s -> 14481.56s]  I'm going to go down here 50 bucks down here as well. This is it bingo. I'm ready. You always get the corners
[14482.91s -> 14484.67s]  I forget what numbers they were
[14484.67s -> 14488.00s]  It will in the 20s
[14488.00s -> 14492.35s]  There it is. That's it, right?
[14493.00s -> 14494.52s]  Oh shit
[14494.52s -> 14500.59s]  It's okay 30 spins
[14502.14s -> 14504.38s]  I'm keeping the same ones
[14504.38s -> 14506.62s]  Don't move another thing in roulette. Don't move
[14511.95s -> 14513.31s]  precisely why
[14513.31s -> 14516.03s]  I wasn't wait. Oh, i'm in 22 23 24
[14518.67s -> 14520.83s]  Don't move
[14520.83s -> 14523.79s]  32 33 35 36 20 we're looking for 30s
[14531.71s -> 14538.76s]  Don't move exactly. That's why you don't fucking move. That's not wait 32
[14542.12s -> 14549.55s]  Don't move just don't bet any money bet one dollar
[14550.84s -> 14552.12s]  Wait, could I?
[14552.12s -> 14555.66s]  There it is
[14555.66s -> 14557.98s]  What the fuck are you talking about? What?
[14562.67s -> 14565.55s]  Just don't bet I have to now i'm down 400
[14566.67s -> 14569.55s]  Don't move. It's gonna hit it just has to hit once and i'm up
[14576.36s -> 14580.51s]  Oh, fuck you
[14580.51s -> 14582.33s]  I'm not moving
[14582.33s -> 14589.18s]  Because the second I take it off, it's gonna hit one of these eight numbers. This guy's fucking incompetent
[14589.66s -> 14593.34s]  It's a game where you spin a marble around and random person wins
[14595.68s -> 14600.56s]  There is no skill in roulette. It's just throwing a dice in the air. What do you mean?
[14606.09s -> 14610.09s]  I mean, I know maybe you sit there and rub your belly before each spin, but that doesn't do anything
[14610.73s -> 14618.97s]  That's the one right there bingo
[14627.60s -> 14633.55s]  Do it 28
[14641.29s -> 14643.66s]  That's it
[14643.66s -> 14645.10s]  Why?
[14645.10s -> 14658.09s]  You gotta start looking for people that remember you
[14662.80s -> 14665.04s]  Look jeremy at the casino
[14666.40s -> 14668.40s]  I hope they remember you
[14678.97s -> 14680.97s]  Give me the minus two as I deserve it
[14680.97s -> 14699.31s]  Oh my god, what happens if you have no more money? Do I just leave the table? Don't move he says
[14700.56s -> 14702.56s]  That usually works. Look it hits like
[14702.96s -> 14704.96s]  Whatever. I won't do that again
[14708.43s -> 14715.42s]  Blackjack tournament, let's go. Why not just go to a real casino because this is not real money
[14716.14s -> 14718.03s]  This is just make-believe
[14718.03s -> 14722.67s]  You want me to go to a casino and just drop like five grand and just lose. I don't why would I do that?
[14723.87s -> 14725.87s]  All right highest bank roll
[14725.95s -> 14735.13s]  I need to win one hand here and then play one dollar a hand
[14739.72s -> 14743.80s]  Come on, I said to win one hand. All right, that's it. Now i'm gonna play one dollar for the rest of the game
[14756.75s -> 14759.28s]  One dollar I don't want to clean that
[14760.40s -> 14762.40s]  Okay, i'm gonna win the tournament now
[14768.91s -> 14773.58s]  This is four grand by the way
[14773.58s -> 14778.30s]  Honestly, you know, I gotta try I gotta try to screw over the person next to me. They're looking for what are they looking for?
[14778.86s -> 14781.42s]  I can play 45 hands
[14782.22s -> 14786.30s]  So if I take another card, I could just completely screw Evelyn over
[14789.23s -> 14792.59s]  But that's what you needed
[14792.59s -> 14797.71s]  Yeah, you lose I win
[14797.71s -> 14802.41s]  Again, uh people take a look around you go big first
[14804.16s -> 14807.28s]  I got blackjack with a dollar. It doesn't whatever I just have to survive
[14810.80s -> 14812.80s]  Kimberly's coming up here with a thousand two
[14818.20s -> 14820.20s]  You need to bet two dollars. No, I don't not yet
[14824.27s -> 14827.47s]  Where were these hands when I was playing 40 minutes ago?
[14828.35s -> 14834.97s]  Why?
[14834.97s -> 14836.97s]  Okay, i'm still in the lead
[14846.19s -> 14848.91s]  Oh, no, they're cowards. They're not gonna bet more than a dog. Wait
[14849.71s -> 14851.71s]  You double down over there. I hope she loses
[14852.35s -> 14857.74s]  Come on. Okay. It's all right
[14857.74s -> 14865.23s]  What's Kimberly doing three dollars?
[14867.72s -> 14869.72s]  Oh my god, what the fuck?
[14872.86s -> 14878.75s]  Yeah, there's a guy in the security window right now like mr. Green just currently betting one dollar instead of 250 dollars a hand
[14880.12s -> 14884.36s]  Yeah, just starting to let him win. So then he starts that something gets cocky and puts a hundred dollars on the table
[14884.98s -> 14891.54s]  assholes
[14891.54s -> 14893.88s]  1015 oh, that's she just bet five bucks
[14896.27s -> 14906.40s]  I still think she's gonna lose
[14906.40s -> 14912.97s]  But I took all the cards from her
[14912.97s -> 14916.09s]  By the way, the the profits are going right to burger gym. Hope you guys know that
[14916.73s -> 14920.70s]  Because i'm guaranteed to win this
[14922.64s -> 14924.64s]  21 shit, she's climbing
[14925.69s -> 14927.13s]  I don't like that
[14927.13s -> 14929.13s]  Is that 1018?
[14929.45s -> 14933.45s]  I think I might no I can't I have to just play the statistics that she's not gonna bet more
[14935.44s -> 14945.69s]  She's going four dollars now. Can I with like attrition here? Can I win this? Can I keep doing this?
[14950.11s -> 14952.06s]  I'm good
[14952.06s -> 14954.06s]  At two bucks. No, no way
[14955.16s -> 14957.16s]  I have 20 more hands of one dollar
[14964.54s -> 14966.54s]  Jerma read books or just chat
[14967.10s -> 14970.48s]  Probably just chat at this point
[14970.48s -> 14975.95s]  Hit again
[14975.95s -> 14978.25s]  Shit
[14978.25s -> 14980.25s]  Bet five. No, why would I bet five?
[14981.32s -> 14984.28s]  I don't have to increase my bet until kimberly gets up to
[14985.47s -> 14986.65s]  like
[14986.65s -> 14988.65s]  1030 1040
[14993.02s -> 14994.54s]  Why would I do that?
[14994.54s -> 14998.83s]  She's gonna lose and she did one dollar. She's trying to do the same thing. She's trying to bait me
[15004.19s -> 15007.15s]  Okay, all right, we know i'm the little we're almost halfway there
[15010.94s -> 15013.74s]  All right, how kimberly do let go five bucks lose it
[15017.02s -> 15017.98s]  She has
[15018.04s -> 15025.84s]  17 versus five fuck. Uh-oh
[15027.47s -> 15029.47s]  Slowly, she is closing the gap
[15031.07s -> 15034.59s]  At 250 to throw her off. No if I lose it's over
[15039.66s -> 15041.66s]  16 versus five she's got okay
[15042.80s -> 15044.80s]  Oh shit. Okay. She has 13
[15045.84s -> 15050.36s]  This is a hand all of us are gonna win. Oh shit. All right. I got what do I do?
[15051.48s -> 15053.16s]  I have to bet 10 bucks
[15053.16s -> 15057.90s]  What do I do? She's climbing. No, I don't have to do that yet. Stick with the strategy
[15060.19s -> 15062.19s]  I have to stay with the strategy. I'll be fine
[15067.34s -> 15071.02s]  Sorry, I gained a little bit of ground there. She lost two. I lost one
[15071.66s -> 15088.94s]  Bet all your money to throw off her rhythm. Oh, I don't have to do it yet
[15089.50s -> 15094.75s]  Go back to sneak jim
[15095.50s -> 15097.50s]  Are you combining two games you've seen today?
[15099.60s -> 15101.52s]  That was a four dollar bet
[15101.52s -> 15103.20s]  Oh, she's in trouble
[15103.20s -> 15105.20s]  She's gonna lose that four dollar bet
[15107.66s -> 15109.21s]  Hey
[15109.21s -> 15110.81s]  Yes. All right. We're good
[15110.81s -> 15117.85s]  If you win an all-in you're gonna win the tournament
[15118.49s -> 15118.65s]  Yeah
[15118.65s -> 15123.13s]  But if I just slowly burn one dollar a hand and she slowly burns like two dollars every other hand
[15123.13s -> 15124.25s]  I'm gonna win
[15124.25s -> 15127.28s]  She's gonna lose right there
[15127.28s -> 15129.12s]  Yeah, she she's fucked
[15129.12s -> 15132.59s]  That's four dollar lose. Oh, it's all right. Whatever
[15133.47s -> 15141.61s]  Can you please at least try to play as mr. Green's mr. Green has?
[15142.23s -> 15144.49s]  A hundred thousand dollars at least on the table
[15145.21s -> 15146.65s]  I'm not there yet
[15146.65s -> 15152.64s]  Shit. All right. Everybody lost
[15152.64s -> 15162.30s]  only like 11 hands
[15162.30s -> 15165.50s]  This should be a minimum bet because being able to do one dollar
[15165.50s -> 15168.22s]  I just bet 50 bucks the first hand and i'm just gonna coast to victory
[15172.12s -> 15173.88s]  Yeah, that's sealed right there I think
[15173.88s -> 15181.76s]  At 50 now. No
[15183.10s -> 15185.34s]  I don't have to bet 50 dollars. There's no reason to
[15195.39s -> 15198.03s]  That's fine. All right. Here we go. This is a lot to win
[15199.13s -> 15201.68s]  $4,000
[15201.68s -> 15204.56s]  Do a 150 dollar hand right now or i'm gonna resident sleeper
[15206.40s -> 15207.84s]  Go for it. I don't care
[15207.84s -> 15211.02s]  I'm not losing this tournament. I've been here for so long
[15214.67s -> 15218.19s]  No, i'm about to win four thousand dollars then I take that to burger gym
[15220.43s -> 15222.43s]  And we're gonna do huge bets
[15226.81s -> 15228.81s]  We're fine. All right, it's it's sealed
[15229.05s -> 15231.61s]  As long as she doesn't win like another five or ten dollar hand
[15238.07s -> 15244.32s]  standing
[15244.32s -> 15246.49s]  Okay, only six more hands
[15249.69s -> 15254.75s]  Playing smart is pog. Don't listen to them. I have blown more fake money on this stream
[15255.47s -> 15258.11s]  Doing dumb things like that, but it's a guaranteed victory
[15258.83s -> 15266.70s]  i'm taking the sure thing
[15266.70s -> 15269.50s]  I feel like michelle's gonna turn to me take the glasses off and go like
[15271.40s -> 15279.21s]  Like a big tongue's gonna come out let's split these let's split fives for fun
[15287.29s -> 15289.29s]  Yeah, two dollars
[15291.77s -> 15293.77s]  Michelle's uh getting desperate

[15403.48s -> 15417.47s]  You won the thousand dollar blackjack tournament to win the counselor as a bonus prize. You must play and win another tournament to win the prize
[15418.19s -> 15429.29s]  That was for a thousand dollars. I thought that was four thousand. Wasn't it four thousand?

[15470.17s -> 15471.39s]  that's
[15471.39s -> 15473.07s]  What's 10 coins?
[15473.07s -> 15477.13s]  Okay, this is stupid, but it could get us a huge payout
[15480.27s -> 15490.24s]  Oh

[15535.74s -> 15543.48s]  Sympathy money. What was that for?
[15543.56s -> 15544.44s]  uh
[15544.44s -> 15550.40s]  That's gonna be all right. That's
[15550.40s -> 15553.72s]  I think okay. I stand alive
[15553.72s -> 15560.56s]  You're a low iq slot streamer if you play slots your low iq
[15568.27s -> 15570.27s]  Shit, hold on. Wait
[15570.75s -> 15586.92s]  Hey, how's that for never mind?
[15586.92s -> 15592.00s]  Ah, that's it. Come on
[15592.88s -> 15594.88s]  Low iq slots river
[15595.98s -> 15599.90s]  What do you mean low iq it takes that much more iq to fucking
[15600.70s -> 15610.70s]  Sit at a roulette table
[15610.70s -> 15614.67s]  Come on do something
[15614.67s -> 15616.35s]  Oh
[15616.35s -> 15618.43s]  My god, that would have been insane
[15619.15s -> 15623.10s]  Let this be a lesson. Don't ever go to the casino. Go you you know
[15623.10s -> 15625.26s]  Go to i'm not gonna tell you not to go to the casino, right?
[15626.06s -> 15629.18s]  If you want to go to the casino and just spend some money to hang out with your friends, that's fine
[15629.42s -> 15632.38s]  But like this shit is just you're gonna lose money in the long term always
[15633.10s -> 15637.82s]  You're never gonna win a substantial amount of money and doesn't matter how many people they put as a cardboard cutout
[15638.14s -> 15640.38s]  Holding like a fucking eleven hundred dollar check
[15641.44s -> 15646.32s]  Look how much carol wine at the slot that that's not that's not that's not gonna do anything
[15646.80s -> 15648.32s]  You're not gonna win that
[15648.32s -> 15657.26s]  You're gonna sit here like I am you're gonna burn through a thousand dollars and you're not gonna be the person with a check in their hand
[15659.55s -> 15671.02s]  It's a lesson
[15671.02s -> 15678.41s]  But my grandmother won i'm a net positive from casinos
[15680.00s -> 15681.90s]  That's really good
[15681.90s -> 15683.34s]  Try to keep it that way
[15683.34s -> 15690.32s]  We just need another big hit so I can go back to burger gym
[15696.14s -> 15698.14s]  2k not 1k
[15698.30s -> 15700.30s]  And what you fixed it
[15700.86s -> 15702.54s]  My point still stands
[15702.54s -> 15705.04s]  Give me that way don't ever go back
[15707.37s -> 15710.73s]  Come on don't I've this is two thousand dollars in king of um

[16068.16s -> 16070.24s]  I want to should I do less numbers?
[16070.96s -> 16080.70s]  How many numbers should I do max for the most amount of profit?
[16084.75s -> 16088.11s]  Four numbers do one number. That sounds terrible
[16088.67s -> 16091.87s]  All right, we're gonna do 35 because that's how old I am
[16092.35s -> 16098.75s]  And this is how old i'm gonna be
[16099.15s -> 16109.61s]  this year
[16109.61s -> 16131.18s]  It won. All right. There's one. There's another one. There's i'm getting one credit for this
[16137.44s -> 16143.18s]  This sucks
[16143.18s -> 16145.18s]  one credit for each
[16145.26s -> 16153.66s]  You gotta do at least three. All right, we're gonna do all the corners
[16157.72s -> 16161.44s]  right in the middle and then
[16162.28s -> 16181.71s]  These two and these two all right go. All right, that's
[16182.19s -> 16196.44s]  I don't understand why that what's happening too much. I would rather play burger gym and
[16197.08s -> 16209.88s]  Cry he's playing this to the stream ends. That's not true. I'm just enjoying myself. All right. There we go
[16210.28s -> 16213.66s]  Come on, give me like a four. All right
[16215.28s -> 16217.28s]  Okay, I mean that's horrible
[16217.44s -> 16234.01s]  How would you ever play this game? Nobody enjoys themselves at a casino stop lying. That's not true if you win like five thousand dollars
[16234.73s -> 16242.25s]  And then you take a hundred dollars out and you play one dollar bets everywhere you leave with four thousand nine hundred and ninety dollars
[16243.37s -> 16260.12s]  Free car poker sucks, but i'm gonna play it. Please play the playstation connect wizard game to this. I would prefer that too
[16264.76s -> 16266.10s]  All right, let's do
[16266.10s -> 16267.88s]  25 in the ante
[16267.88s -> 16272.68s]  Let's go ahead and make the best handicap with three cards
[16273.40s -> 16279.10s]  Looking for a flush
[16279.10s -> 16285.93s]  I'm gonna bet on this one. There it is. All right, not bad. It's I got the high card
[16286.65s -> 16289.53s]  You guys don't understand how this works
[16289.53s -> 16295.69s]  I have king so I get the high card. I win everyone plays against the dealer. I hate this game, but i'm gonna play it
[16296.70s -> 16299.34s]  If I do if I put money on pair plus by the way
[16301.50s -> 16305.42s]  If I put money on pair plus if I get a pair or above that
[16306.97s -> 16310.17s]  I make a little bit of money a lot of money. Actually, let's go for a big one
[16310.81s -> 16325.18s]  Give me a pair. It's not a pair. I'm out. I have to fold if this hand sucks
[16325.82s -> 16335.69s]  And I would have lost
[16335.69s -> 16337.21s]  You're a moron
[16337.21s -> 16343.13s]  He's playing pair plus omega lol. I know it's a sucker bet, but whatever sometimes suckers win a lot of money
[16348.81s -> 16351.07s]  shit
[16351.07s -> 16353.23s]  Xbox sucks. The xbox is one of the best systems
[16355.63s -> 16359.21s]  oh
[16359.21s -> 16367.04s]  Three cards suck go all in I just gotta get one decent uh pair plus hand. It's not a pair plus
[16369.02s -> 16372.30s]  But i'm gonna play because I have a king and it's just a high card
[16373.10s -> 16379.26s]  Yep
[16379.26s -> 16381.56s]  This time we're gonna go even higher
[16381.56s -> 16383.80s]  What do you think? All right, i'm looking for a big pair plus
[16384.44s -> 16386.52s]  Wow, that's bad stupid idea
[16387.16s -> 16392.51s]  I'll do 70 bucks. Let's go pairs
[16393.39s -> 16396.44s]  Give me a pair
[16396.44s -> 16401.20s]  uh
[16401.20s -> 16403.20s]  I have to have to yeah, i'm gonna stay in
[16405.88s -> 16407.88s]  All right. I'm all right. I only lost 45 dollars
[16408.44s -> 16413.00s]  Get more omega low. I this is all I got i'm not going back to the stupid cashier
[16416.86s -> 16417.90s]  pair
[16417.90s -> 16423.23s]  What I lost
[16423.23s -> 16432.92s]  Then I said be funny ban that person for life
[16433.88s -> 16445.69s]  permanently
[16445.69s -> 16446.73s]  Damn it
[16446.73s -> 16448.73s]  I would have that would have been a flush
[16450.94s -> 16460.32s]  All right, just it's a queen. I get a lee i'm only leasing whatever give me something better than a pair
[16462.27s -> 16467.39s]  Give me something better than this so I can prove to everybody here that this is like not a sucker's bet every single time
[16468.03s -> 16471.23s]  See, why do you get the pairs?
[16471.23s -> 16480.51s]  For a second. I thought that said I was broke
[16480.75s -> 16488.75s]  But that person's name is brook old again air plus low iq. That's fine. But
[16489.47s -> 16494.19s]  Somebody's gonna come over to this table. They're gonna put 100 on pair plus and they're gonna win 15 000
[16496.00s -> 16498.00s]  Like me like me
[16498.08s -> 16503.12s]  Like me right now like me like me like this guy right here like me
[16504.16s -> 16505.76s]  I just won
[16505.76s -> 16508.96s]  120 that's nothing. That's that's uh, this is a sucker's bet
[16518.28s -> 16519.88s]  It's only two to one
[16519.88s -> 16521.40s]  Well, that was bad
[16521.40s -> 16530.67s]  It is a sucker's bet
[16532.11s -> 16534.73s]  Yeah, let's show you a sucker
[16539.52s -> 16549.18s]  How's that for a fucking sucker bet? Oh, I thought it was gonna be a straight. I thought it was gonna be a straight
[16552.94s -> 16556.56s]  Do it again
[16556.56s -> 16559.28s]  Come on. This is the i'm then i'm gonna leave it. I'm gonna play a different game
[16562.81s -> 16582.20s]  Oh my god. Sorry
[16592.24s -> 16594.24s]  My brain's turning into soup
[16594.24s -> 16599.42s]  Well, go get some crackers
[16599.42s -> 16622.65s]  I exit the game what just happened. He's trying to exit the table. Why do I have a thousand dollars?
[16634.30s -> 16636.46s]  Oh, I didn't save the game in like an hour and a half
[16644.89s -> 16648.06s]  Oops
[16648.06s -> 16650.70s]  Oh, we got that big. Hey, remember we got that big hit from
[16651.34s -> 16652.38s]  uh
[16652.38s -> 16654.30s]  chicago
[16654.30s -> 16663.93s]  Royale whatever it is
[16663.93s -> 16673.69s]  No value. Okay. I'm just gonna play like five dollar hands and then go into the pair plus and put as much as I can
[16674.25s -> 16694.72s]  Play this all night. I don't think I want to I don't want to play this all night
[16694.72s -> 16697.44s]  This game is not as fun as like vegas steaks was
[16698.00s -> 16710.44s]  It's not a pair plus
[16710.44s -> 16713.58s]  I'm gonna throw up because of this
[16714.46s -> 16717.10s]  Why did I not play that hand? I would have won at least five dollars back
[16717.18s -> 16720.38s]  Does it really matter if I want to win five dollars back at this point? Not really
[16729.28s -> 16751.40s]  All right. I'm getting a new game. We're gonna play into the game here. It's been two hours. Yeah, I had fun. It's been fun
[16754.80s -> 16756.56s]  You had a flush what?
[16756.56s -> 16760.84s]  Wait, I had a I actually had a flush
[16762.11s -> 16767.87s]  Wait, that would have been probably like three or four thousand dollars at least if I would have been like 10 grand. Really?
[16769.45s -> 16779.79s]  I had the flush
[16779.79s -> 16787.23s]  I wasn't even paying attention you streamed this for two hours. I don't think it was that long
[16796.48s -> 16810.81s]  It was not that long it was not burger gym is back. This is exhausting
[16813.72s -> 16815.56s]  We're not like doing sit-ups
[16815.56s -> 16817.56s]  I'm just playing in the casino game
[16838.94s -> 16840.54s]  Oh, there it is
[16840.54s -> 16851.79s]  There it is
[16851.79s -> 16854.35s]  Burger gym for three hours. No, i'm done after this
[16856.24s -> 16861.56s]  All right, that's it. What this is the last spin and then that's it and then one more after that
[16867.88s -> 16871.69s]  All right next game
[16871.69s -> 16879.76s]  God damn it. All right. I'm gonna pee i'll come back. We'll play another game
[16881.18s -> 16882.97s]  xbox
[16882.97s -> 16886.65s]  Night continues
[16886.65s -> 17016.33s]  We're back. Okay. This is another game that i'm not sure
[17017.55s -> 17021.31s]  How good this is gonna be but I saw the I kind of just saw the title
[17022.81s -> 17026.41s]  And I had to try it. I had to play it. I had to buy it
[17028.59s -> 17030.67s]  And that game what i'm referring to obviously
[17031.63s -> 17034.91s]  Is dyno topia the sunstone odyssey for xbox?
[17035.63s -> 17050.16s]  I wonder uh, let's see how this is
[17051.85s -> 17054.97s]  Dino topia, let's say safely. Look at it. It looks a little
[17055.77s -> 17057.85s]  A little broken in the middle there, but that's okay
[17059.02s -> 17061.02s]  apprentice master
[17061.02s -> 17068.36s]  apprentice
[17068.36s -> 17070.12s]  I know doi doi doi
[17070.12s -> 17074.33s]  I had a vhs of this show. Wait, this is a tv show
[17075.13s -> 17086.89s]  Holy shit
[17087.37s -> 17089.61s]  Hold on. Wait a second. Did that just go?
[17104.22s -> 17105.58s]  Billy west
[17105.58s -> 17115.08s]  That t-rex I swear to god that was like
[17116.99s -> 17118.59s]  I need to hear a clip of that
[17118.59s -> 17121.02s]  I'm not in control of the character
[17121.02s -> 17129.56s]  What was the point of showing that they couldn't just say get up. We gotta go
[17133.95s -> 17138.48s]  They show that
[17138.48s -> 17140.48s]  Here it is. Let's go inside
[17141.92s -> 17143.52s]  Follow your brother
[17143.52s -> 17144.64s]  jacob
[17144.64s -> 17147.13s]  Move in the direction you wish to go
[17147.45s -> 17149.29s]  Press b to jump
[17149.29s -> 17156.76s]  Okay, do I have attacks?
[17156.76s -> 17160.60s]  Ah, the gemini twins have been expecting you
[17161.16s -> 17168.12s]  Drake this is castor bollocks. He was a friend of dad's he taught me how to fight and I brought you here
[17168.36s -> 17174.60s]  So he can teach you the stick. It's good to meet you. Mr. Pollock's. I was so sad to hear about your father
[17175.55s -> 17179.79s]  Jonas was a good friend of mine. It's shrek. Thanks for your concern. Mr. Pollock
[17179.79s -> 17185.47s]  This stupid island's been nothing but trouble since we were how are we gonna find a t-rex with a broomstick?
[17186.03s -> 17188.33s]  It doesn't seem very good
[17190.17s -> 17194.41s]  Just because some blind dinosaur lets him ride around on her
[17195.32s -> 17199.48s]  You know, he was doing her a favor as much as she was doing for him
[17200.20s -> 17204.46s]  And then he felt like we owed dinotopia some big debt of gratitude
[17205.72s -> 17208.68s]  I'm not buying it. You know, there's more to it than that
[17209.24s -> 17211.24s]  Everything is happening so fast. Yeah
[17218.76s -> 17224.44s]  It's hard for her 24th birthday with the root that keeps these dinotopians alive for so long
[17225.00s -> 17227.00s]  He shouldn't have been out there by himself
[17227.16s -> 17230.52s]  But it was just an unfortunate accident looks like a typewriter
[17231.24s -> 17237.24s]  That has fucked up teeth whatever they're called. Sorry. It's my dad. That's no accident
[17237.88s -> 17241.72s]  Is what is he saying? He wants a dinosaur is gonna be tried for murder
[17242.76s -> 17249.00s]  You may have animals to defend dinotopia not to destroy it. Whatever i'll do what I want
[17249.88s -> 17252.36s]  I'll do it. Wait, i'll do it. I won't
[17253.00s -> 17264.28s]  Agree to train you because you've just faced a very traumatic event in your dinosaurs committed to murder
[17265.00s -> 17269.39s]  I hope they talk god. I hope they talk to teach you. This is why I ask you
[17269.87s -> 17275.44s]  Please be cautious with the skills that I teach i've already gone over most of this with jacob
[17276.24s -> 17282.24s]  So let's get my favorite tv show jacob and drake drake and jacob staff of yours
[17282.56s -> 17287.72s]  I'm also giving you a sunstone counterweight to place on the other end of your staff
[17289.40s -> 17293.40s]  This particular mallet head come on that was at least a plus on one very strong
[17293.64s -> 17300.49s]  But three sages who live throughout dinotopia who are former guardians of the island
[17300.73s -> 17304.33s]  They are far too old now to defend much of anything
[17305.21s -> 17307.21s]  If you ever meet any of them
[17307.53s -> 17311.05s]  I'm sure with some persuasion they'd give you other mallet heads
[17311.77s -> 17318.57s]  Who may find other smaller sons drake and for sand jacob? Yeah, that's right sunstones when placed into a mallet
[17321.53s -> 17326.25s]  Each collected sunstone will add to a pool of energy displayed in the upper left corner with the blue bar
[17326.89s -> 17330.41s]  This sunstone energy can be used for sunstone powers when you receive them
[17331.13s -> 17339.56s]  It is important that you are always aware of threats around you move in the direction you want to orient the camera
[17340.28s -> 17345.08s]  Press to reorient camera first. What is that a chocolate chip? What is that?
[17345.96s -> 17350.76s]  Let us go over a few basic attacks approach the training dummy and attack it
[17352.65s -> 17354.65s]  What's with that neck?
[17356.57s -> 17365.60s]  The super nerd neck that's it
[17372.22s -> 17374.22s]  Can't wait to beat the dinosaurs with this move
[17382.59s -> 17388.11s]  Okay, interact. Hey, thanks for teaching me. You didn't teach me anything if you target an enemy before you attack
[17389.13s -> 17393.61s]  Focus your movements on that. He made a training dummy and just said hey just do whatever you want to
[17394.17s -> 17395.85s]  Swing at it, I guess
[17395.85s -> 17399.56s]  This is not you're not teaching me anything
[17401.45s -> 17403.69s]  Hold to select closest next target
[17406.70s -> 17412.25s]  Hold to untarget return. Wait, hold on
[17413.31s -> 17415.31s]  You touch it and it targets
[17415.63s -> 17418.19s]  Hold to un okay. You tap it to go to another target
[17418.83s -> 17420.51s]  Hold to untarget
[17420.51s -> 17426.75s]  Okay, I got it. Hold down target a dummy and throw a hobby pepper
[17432.03s -> 17433.72s]  What?
[17433.72s -> 17435.96s]  He didn't even teach me that i'm learning on my own
[17441.21s -> 17446.04s]  Be careful when you use hobby peppers
[17446.44s -> 17452.00s]  Usually they'll blind an opponent though. Sometimes all they'll do is make them angry
[17452.56s -> 17457.36s]  The dino topia mini series is free and legal to watch on youtube right now. I do not believe that I
[17458.00s -> 17462.16s]  Just because something is free does not mean I have the rights to broadcast it
[17463.52s -> 17470.76s]  Acts will grow stronger who receive instructions for other attacks from messenger birds. I send out
[17475.42s -> 17480.54s]  Let's go. I've got to get going now zane and the other outsiders are waiting for me
[17481.02s -> 17484.54s]  Are you sure I can't persuade you to join that robin atkins downs?
[17485.98s -> 17487.58s]  I think it is
[17487.58s -> 17489.58s]  It is it is it is
[17490.38s -> 17495.79s]  Is it no way you noodle head get the same things. That's him. It's him. It's him
[17499.55s -> 17504.83s]  I still think it's a mistake for you to run off and join those thugs. Well, I am that's him
[17504.99s -> 17507.47s]  And if I were you I'd be careful
[17507.71s -> 17513.79s]  The outsiders might just have something planned that's coming your way. I think that after I think that actually is him
[17516.67s -> 17523.79s]  Is it listen drake be careful things could get hairy these are some pretty ruthless guys, let's see
[17524.27s -> 17526.19s]  I think it's him
[17526.19s -> 17529.58s]  Thanks for your concern video games. I can take care of myself
[17530.22s -> 17533.66s]  You should be careful too though. Is it him? I don't trust those ones come up
[17534.30s -> 17540.30s]  We might not see eye to eye on this dyno topia my brother when it's gone still care about you thanks
[17540.78s -> 17546.94s]  Goodbye. Well, thanks for your help. Mr. Pollock's. I should probably get going too. Oh welcome drake
[17547.98s -> 17553.66s]  I need to find that. This is him look up miss oxbridge. She is a wise old dyno topia
[17553.74s -> 17555.74s]  I think may have another
[17556.86s -> 17562.78s]  Bollock use your help with one last thing. I know topia. Where is it? He's placed my favorite glass
[17563.02s -> 17566.78s]  What the fuck it's not him in the cave if you find them for me
[17567.26s -> 17572.70s]  I will give you some hobie peppers to take with you. I understand if you need to get going though
[17573.26s -> 17575.10s]  shit
[17575.10s -> 17577.74s]  Pastor pollock's has lost his marbles help him find them what?
[17578.54s -> 17581.74s]  The hell is that you did that?
[17586.96s -> 17597.31s]  Okay, what the hell do I have to do?
[17597.31s -> 17599.31s]  I forget what am I doing kill the bird?
[17599.71s -> 17614.81s]  I'm trying I promise
[17620.00s -> 17622.00s]  He lost his marbles like in his house
[17632.01s -> 17634.17s]  Find miss oxbridge at the town center
[17634.97s -> 17636.97s]  Find the glass rocks
[17642.35s -> 17646.40s]  What?
[17646.40s -> 17650.60s]  Okay, wait while targeted pulled to dodge in a direction
[17651.32s -> 17655.00s]  Hold x to block. What is this? Why is there why is there a dinosaur in his house?
[17668.24s -> 17671.50s]  This is actually kind of cool. I like this
[17671.50s -> 17673.10s]  I get experience for that
[17673.10s -> 17676.91s]  This game's kind of fun. I like it. I can't wait to fight a t-rex
[17686.32s -> 17689.93s]  Stop hurting him. Is this his pet or something?
[17690.49s -> 17695.16s]  I have no idea where i'm supposed to go
[17695.16s -> 17704.64s]  I'm just gonna go back down go to the town center. This looks like um, what looks like this big darn asses
[17705.28s -> 17709.69s]  It was mr. Bollocks's dog
[17709.69s -> 17716.99s]  All right, i'm gonna leave
[17716.99s -> 17718.76s]  Let's go to the town center
[17718.76s -> 17727.28s]  You've not completed all quests on this level
[17730.20s -> 17732.20s]  What the fuck are you talking about? What?
[17743.69s -> 17745.69s]  Where's this guy's marbles?
[17750.17s -> 17761.42s]  Find his marbles
[17761.42s -> 17765.50s]  Is there sprint?
[17765.50s -> 17767.50s]  Are they in a chest or something?
[17767.74s -> 17772.60s]  You can leave without doing the quests. Can I?
[17773.24s -> 17779.26s]  Holy shit, that was a huge jump
[17783.44s -> 17786.48s]  I know it's a figure of speech, but why would it want me to stay here?
[17787.04s -> 17797.60s]  Nobody played this game. Nobody knows
[17798.32s -> 17810.30s]  Okay
[17810.30s -> 17816.00s]  Now what?
[17816.00s -> 17820.03s]  I'm miss oxbridge
[17820.03s -> 17822.35s]  Are these bad? Wait, are these bad? Are these?
[17822.99s -> 17827.00s]  Dinosaurs talk?
[17827.00s -> 17827.96s]  What?
[17827.96s -> 17836.17s]  That t-rex what that t-rex did go
[17840.56s -> 17842.56s]  I knew something was weird about the way he roared
[17847.24s -> 17852.12s]  Hi there. I wonder if you could help out a fellow dinotopia. I'm having a big party tonight
[17852.46s -> 17854.46s]  And I thought some apple pies would be nice to have
[17854.94s -> 17858.30s]  My friends are donating the apples and have placed them throughout town
[17858.78s -> 17862.38s]  But I've got to get my house cleaned and don't have the time so weird more
[17862.62s -> 17866.38s]  Would you be so kind as to get to collect all the apples baskets?
[17866.62s -> 17869.34s]  I'll trade you some of my hobby peppers for the apples
[17873.00s -> 17875.00s]  Okay, I see one right here
[17877.66s -> 17879.66s]  That wasn't his dog was that this
[17879.98s -> 17881.58s]  There's like friend
[17881.58s -> 17883.66s]  Or it's like
[17883.66s -> 17885.90s]  Significant other or something. I don't know. Uh, this is um
[17886.62s -> 17894.78s]  I don't know they could talk
[17894.78s -> 17896.30s]  This is neighbor
[17896.30s -> 17899.31s]  What's the look this little kid here?
[17899.55s -> 17904.12s]  You can't talk to the kid
[17904.12s -> 17906.12s]  This looks so strange
[17906.12s -> 17920.76s]  Where you go? Oh, there he is
[17922.88s -> 17927.05s]  skip
[17927.05s -> 17929.05s]  Dinotopia. Oh, hold on. What do you have?
[17929.37s -> 17934.84s]  Haven't found all my apples yet. I'm working on it
[17940.65s -> 17943.05s]  Breathe deep young drake gemini
[17943.93s -> 17946.17s]  Seek peace. Are you miss oxbridge?
[17946.81s -> 17953.05s]  Why yes, I will get the apples. I promise my friend castor pollock sent word that he has trained you in the use of a weapon
[17953.53s -> 17956.73s]  You must be cautious with a weapon after all
[17957.21s -> 17960.49s]  The code of dinotopia states that weapons are enemies
[17961.13s -> 17965.53s]  Even to their own the dumbest thing i've ever heard if you are to use this weapon responsibly
[17966.17s -> 17972.25s]  You must wield it as a guardian of dinotopia. You should only use it to help those in need
[17972.89s -> 17975.69s]  And never in a hateful manner. Tell me
[17976.57s -> 17979.55s]  Why do you seek to be a guardian of dinotopia?
[17981.90s -> 17984.46s]  Well, it's not like i'm really seeking it out
[17985.26s -> 17987.66s]  My father deeply loved dinotopia
[17988.30s -> 17993.66s]  Before he passed on he made my brother and me promise to defend dinotopia. It's like a
[17994.22s -> 18000.54s]  My brother's like a mallet. It's a broomstick with a fucking shoehorn on the end faced with life in this land all alone
[18001.42s -> 18008.38s]  The only thing i've ever really cared about is my family. No, all i've got left of it is the promise that I made to my father
[18008.86s -> 18010.38s]  So
[18010.38s -> 18015.98s]  Perhaps in time you may realize your family can extend beyond your relatives
[18016.62s -> 18020.70s]  One thing is for sure young drake. You are not alone
[18021.66s -> 18027.18s]  If you will face the perils of dinotopia's defense, you will need to become stronger
[18027.74s -> 18032.38s]  One thing you must understand is that the entirety of one's strength
[18033.10s -> 18037.58s]  Comes from a balance of one's mind body and spirit
[18038.46s -> 18044.46s]  In my you want the lore I defended dinotopia really I used a stone mallet to defeat
[18044.62s -> 18051.18s]  All those that sought to harm this wonderful land something about the way that their brains would squish mallet for what seems like
[18051.42s -> 18058.06s]  And their skull and brain matter would explode just did it for me within a strong box on a distant platform
[18058.54s -> 18061.02s]  As an exercise to strengthen your mind
[18061.74s -> 18068.14s]  If you can figure out how to get to this strong box and then return to me with the artifact
[18068.86s -> 18071.02s]  I will reward you with the mallet head
[18071.98s -> 18074.43s]  Okay
[18074.43s -> 18076.43s]  Oh, I just there's a jumping quest
[18076.59s -> 18079.76s]  Where is that?
[18079.76s -> 18080.80s]  Over here
[18080.80s -> 18083.74s]  I got the apples for that guy, too
[18083.74s -> 18093.88s]  Can't do it. Don't worry
[18093.88s -> 18095.72s]  smash a dino's brain
[18095.72s -> 18103.12s]  What is it back here?
[18103.12s -> 18105.20s]  Oh shit, it's another dinosaur doesn't talk to
[18112.12s -> 18113.00s]  What?
[18113.00s -> 18122.41s]  Was that just imagining him talking?
[18124.28s -> 18126.28s]  Well, i'm really going crazy
[18133.77s -> 18135.61s]  Apples, all right three four
[18135.61s -> 18138.43s]  He didn't talk dude. What are you talking about?
[18139.71s -> 18142.65s]  I'm the crazy one
[18142.65s -> 18144.41s]  Where's this thing to jump to?
[18144.41s -> 18155.98s]  This game's amazing
[18155.98s -> 18157.98s]  I'm i'm here for a while
[18158.06s -> 18168.00s]  I'm not giving up on this
[18168.00s -> 18173.76s]  Where is this thing to do?
[18173.76s -> 18175.76s]  Game's incredible. All right, i'm gonna play it
[18177.48s -> 18180.68s]  Just would oh it's up there. Okay, it's up. How do I get up there?
[18181.56s -> 18189.77s]  Help me. How do I get up there?
[18189.77s -> 18199.10s]  How do I get up there?
[18199.10s -> 18201.21s]  Can I go up even higher?
[18201.21s -> 18204.78s]  Who's your destination?
[18204.78s -> 18206.78s]  Uh treetop manor
[18206.94s -> 18228.33s]  A completely different area
[18228.33s -> 18230.65s]  It is but I don't think I could go anywhere in the last area
[18238.75s -> 18244.88s]  Why can't they talk?
[18246.32s -> 18247.36s]  Is this it?
[18247.36s -> 18251.36s]  Does it look like it was down? I mean it was up from where I was
[18252.16s -> 18259.87s]  I have no idea
[18259.87s -> 18265.28s]  This way
[18265.28s -> 18269.44s]  It was a prompt and you missed the area
[18270.32s -> 18276.81s]  Go back to the other
[18276.81s -> 18278.33s]  Go back to the other woman
[18278.33s -> 18280.75s]  Come on
[18280.75s -> 18286.76s]  Oh, come on. Really?
[18286.76s -> 18294.64s]  Do I just go back to that other area?
[18295.44s -> 18302.28s]  Is it in that that just same zone?
[18303.24s -> 18319.98s]  I mean, i'll be honest every single thing looks identical. There's no math. I have no idea where I am
[18328.14s -> 18330.38s]  I don't even know what that place was called town center
[18337.16s -> 18340.59s]  Yeah, I look right over here
[18340.59s -> 18342.59s]  Like not do anything about that
[18342.67s -> 18352.40s]  Oh, what the fuck is that?
[18352.56s -> 18357.42s]  Oh my god. All right. Here it is. So I have to jump to that
[18358.06s -> 18362.09s]  How am I supposed to jump to that?
[18362.09s -> 18375.12s]  That's really difficult to do this sucked. All right break these
[18380.86s -> 18386.84s]  Oh, i'm really glad I did that because it would have taken me a very long time. It just fell off the edge
[18387.40s -> 18395.61s]  I i'm fine. I'm good. Give me the weapon
[18399.18s -> 18403.80s]  Turn the statue and then I need one more thing of apples. I would like this
[18410.96s -> 18419.39s]  Apples good job young drake
[18419.95s -> 18424.75s]  You have proven to me that you are worthy of receiving this stone man in 30 minutes
[18424.91s -> 18427.79s]  I am not stopping until I fight at least five dinosaurs
[18428.75s -> 18436.40s]  Which mallet heads?
[18436.40s -> 18438.50s]  Um everybody get down. I thought it was a pterodactyl
[18446.97s -> 18448.97s]  But all animals talk in this world, right?
[18449.60s -> 18454.51s]  Oh my you'd better get to the hatchery hopefully the matriarch is all right
[18455.15s -> 18456.83s]  Remember drake
[18456.83s -> 18459.79s]  Only please this is not dyno topia. This is cringe topia
[18460.99s -> 18463.55s]  To help those in danger of being harmed
[18464.19s -> 18466.75s]  and never ever out of hatred
[18467.71s -> 18470.20s]  What would the difference be if I were to?
[18470.60s -> 18472.68s]  Punch someone in the face right now out of hatred
[18473.32s -> 18475.60s]  Does that change things?
[18475.60s -> 18480.16s]  Like if I were to punch you in the face right now because I hate you does that make it different because I didn't use a weapon
[18480.88s -> 18492.40s]  Travel between areas of the forest outpost using gondolas like the one you arrived in go to the hatchery
[18492.96s -> 18502.14s]  All right. I need apples. It's moral points
[18502.78s -> 18507.16s]  Is it really?
[18507.16s -> 18509.16s]  All right. I need this other guy's apples. Where are they?
[18518.89s -> 18521.21s]  Where's the final bushel of apples?
[18525.45s -> 18527.21s]  this is actually a
[18527.21s -> 18529.53s]  Good and evil system. That's pretty funny actually
[18530.25s -> 18544.72s]  To the right of these fucking apples
[18545.60s -> 18553.53s]  This is a book tv show tie-in game
[18554.17s -> 18565.32s]  Go back up
[18565.32s -> 18568.60s]  All right, I don't think there's another bushel of apples on this floor
[18569.48s -> 18585.34s]  This is not where the hell are they it's right there
[18591.16s -> 18607.02s]  It's not right here right here. All right. What do I get for doing this?
[18607.58s -> 18620.06s]  Great. You've got the hobie peppers now and get these peeled and into the pies
[18621.82s -> 18623.82s]  All right, so I got hobie peppers now let's go
[18624.54s -> 18626.06s]  to the hatchery
[18626.06s -> 18629.82s]  And rescue the dinos in trouble. I don't know
[18630.54s -> 18640.35s]  Is that what I'm supposed to do?
[18640.35s -> 18643.15s]  You're not wearing any pants. I think I believe i'm wearing pants
[18645.56s -> 18653.15s]  What's that exit?
[18653.15s -> 18655.15s]  Fuck close the get down
[18655.23s -> 18657.07s]  Where's the how do I get out of here?
[18657.07s -> 18673.20s]  Okay, here we go hatchery exit
[18673.20s -> 18675.95s]  The hatchery is under attack
[18675.95s -> 18689.53s]  It doesn't look like anybody's really
[18689.53s -> 18693.76s]  That concerned about whatever's happening. I'm not seeing any very much panic
[18694.32s -> 18707.26s]  Have you done fable two yet? I have not done fable two. I don't play I played i've beaten that game like three times
[18708.70s -> 18713.69s]  But not on stream
[18713.69s -> 18715.39s]  next game
[18715.47s -> 18720.35s]  Well, I mean it depends it depends if this is if this continues to be a snooze fest i'm gonna move on
[18728.92s -> 18735.05s]  Okay, let's go. Yeah, I want to see at least a dinosaur or two
[18735.69s -> 18746.27s]  Fable two would be awesome. That's you know, what? That's a really good idea
[18747.07s -> 18757.58s]  Get fable two on the list. I will play through fable two defend the hatchery
[18758.22s -> 18776.38s]  We've got so many games on the list already
[18776.38s -> 18783.44s]  Is this all right? Come on. Let's go. Okay. I feel like this is empty. It's like am I in the
[18784.57s -> 18788.25s]  Like the dev game the dev kit whatever it is like why is it nothing here
[18798.20s -> 18801.18s]  Fable sucks fable three sucks
[18802.38s -> 18807.76s]  Right from what I remember
[18810.48s -> 18812.08s]  Who am I fighting here
[18812.08s -> 18818.17s]  Who's the bad guy?
[18818.17s -> 18820.65s]  In this scenario, am I am I fighting the humans?
[18821.29s -> 18834.09s]  This dinosaur is the is the one getting attacked
[18842.99s -> 18845.55s]  This really is just like dumpy fable with dinosaurs
[18846.91s -> 18849.23s]  But not even fable. This is way worse than fable
[18852.65s -> 18857.55s]  Thank you for helping me if you had gotten here any later, this is so boring
[18861.69s -> 18863.69s]  But there's so much potential
[18868.38s -> 18873.72s]  Get away
[18873.72s -> 18877.80s]  There's so much potential here. Look at it. It's so it's right here in front of us
[18878.76s -> 18880.12s]  We can taste it
[18880.12s -> 18886.09s]  What's wrong with fable three?
[18886.09s -> 18888.97s]  Um fable three is you like open chests to make decisions
[18889.61s -> 18890.97s]  It's stupid
[18891.05s -> 18895.69s]  You go to like the the weird world where you like have to make decisions by using a currency
[18896.33s -> 18898.33s]  I hated that it was stupid
[18902.99s -> 18907.47s]  Unlock like the next like thing to try the next decision to make with like a fucking chest currency thing
[18907.71s -> 18909.95s]  The game is dumb. It was this dumb currency thing. I hated it
[18913.04s -> 18917.20s]  Make sure you got like followers to open the chests. No, I want to just like decide if i'm gonna execute the guy
[18918.22s -> 18919.26s]  Or not
[18919.26s -> 18921.26s]  Give me that decision. I just want to make that decision
[18922.75s -> 18925.47s]  Do I steal the bread or do I not steal the bread make it simple for me?
[18938.33s -> 18941.15s]  Your memory is terrible. I don't think it is that's yeah, then fable
[18949.04s -> 18951.04s]  I thought it was jar jar things
[18967.20s -> 18970.24s]  If you bring me three of these bright blue plants
[18970.40s -> 18974.24s]  I'll give you some information about a sunstone. I don't want to play anymore
[18978.43s -> 18981.31s]  I'm done next game next one. I don't want to play this one anymore
[18981.95s -> 18988.41s]  Wait, this guy's a hostel
[18988.41s -> 19004.67s]  It's a cave man. Yeah, I guess
[19005.15s -> 19012.66s]  That dinosaur looks like my school superintendent
[19017.24s -> 19021.72s]  Huh?
[19021.72s -> 19024.84s]  What are you talking about? How what are you even talking about?
[19025.80s -> 19031.37s]  Especially just want to play fable two
[19034.00s -> 19036.00s]  Should I yay? Should I?
[19036.67s -> 19038.67s]  Can I play should I start fable two?
[19038.91s -> 19047.56s]  Should I play fable two next week and just like beat it like play through it over the weekend?
[19051.08s -> 19053.32s]  Okay, but hold on though. It is fable
[19054.12s -> 19059.80s]  Is my brain remembering is that game actually good and fun and interesting and shit? Like I don't remember
[19060.28s -> 19063.93s]  I think it is right
[19064.09s -> 19077.45s]  There's a game called dyno topia and you just fight
[19078.55s -> 19080.55s]  defias bandits with shields
[19084.08s -> 19085.60s]  I fall down
[19085.60s -> 19096.78s]  What do I have superpowers?
[19097.74s -> 19103.58s]  You said you beat fable two like three times I did like 10 years ago. I don't remember anything about the game
[19104.99s -> 19106.99s]  All I remember is this one specific line
[19107.39s -> 19111.12s]  It'll be as normal as the sound of your own heartbeat
[19111.92s -> 19115.92s]  I don't know what the context is. I don't know where the character is. I just remember that line
[19116.08s -> 19118.08s]  I don't know what that means, but I know it's in the game
[19123.45s -> 19125.45s]  play fable three
[19126.33s -> 19144.54s]  Whoa, that's cool play gothic. I have gothic three. I think I have all the gothic games installed right now
[19146.32s -> 19148.80s]  I keep adding shit to lists and then I never play them
[19155.26s -> 19159.26s]  I have so many games that you're just gonna see trickled in over like months and years of time
[19160.06s -> 19162.52s]  Sometimes I forget I even bought them or installed them
[19163.24s -> 19167.08s]  And then it takes somebody to remind me like oh, hey, dude play gothic and i'm like, oh, yeah
[19167.24s -> 19170.04s]  I have fucking every gothic installed right now. I have all of them
[19171.36s -> 19173.36s]  All right, god doesn't play that
[19183.16s -> 19186.68s]  Three is shit. Yeah, I would play two before I play three. I talk to the
[19188.36s -> 19191.69s]  I can't talk to the one source
[19191.69s -> 19199.50s]  Please god do not play sneak king
[19200.54s -> 19202.54s]  I already did and everybody hated it. Yeah, I did too
[19205.95s -> 19207.95s]  Oh, I need to play nba street as well
[19208.99s -> 19210.27s]  nba street
[19210.27s -> 19213.13s]  I think one of my favorite games on xbox 360 and xbox
[19218.08s -> 19219.84s]  Oh fuck. I need to play that
[19219.84s -> 19228.99s]  I'm a street is probably the best game
[19229.31s -> 19237.26s]  That's a sports game. Let's make that clear and the nba street franchise
[19237.74s -> 19243.74s]  Was the best sports franchise that and slugfest and they just decided to stop making them because for some stupid ass reason
[19244.62s -> 19252.94s]  Every video game company decided that simulations and realistic take me seriously video games were what everybody I apparently cared about and nobody does
[19255.32s -> 19259.72s]  Where are the crazy fucking slugfest games? Where's where's nfl blitz?
[19260.60s -> 19265.72s]  Why I don't want to play madden. I want to play blitz. I don't want to play mlb the show
[19266.04s -> 19271.40s]  I want to play slugfest. I don't want to fucking play nba 2k. I want to play nba street
[19272.12s -> 19274.12s]  Why did they stop making these games?
[19276.48s -> 19278.89s]  They stopped making them
[19278.89s -> 19286.09s]  We have like a full two generations of consoles of new technology and new engines. That would be so much fun with these games
[19288.59s -> 19290.59s]  How would you stop making nfl blitz?
[19296.38s -> 19301.50s]  Dude nba street, it's not like oh, they wouldn't be popular. They're not popular. They weren't that popular. You're misremembering things
[19301.98s -> 19303.98s]  NBA street was so popular
[19304.78s -> 19309.66s]  It was one of the most fun arcade games ever. It was so good
[19310.38s -> 19313.90s]  I want to make like another one
[19316.06s -> 19321.18s]  And they've they've done a go nba jam. Yeah, remember when we like ported that to fucking iphones
[19321.66s -> 19323.82s]  No, no, no, give me another one. Give me a new one
[19324.38s -> 19326.70s]  That you didn't just like make it in flash
[19328.57s -> 19333.93s]  Hey guys, remember nba jam. Oh, you're gonna love this one. The only difference is we made it in flash this time
[19334.49s -> 19338.78s]  Well, you know, I don't like come on. You mean give me a real one
[19339.58s -> 19350.41s]  Please stop hogging the xbox. Your brother wants to play halo
[19351.28s -> 19354.16s]  Fuck halo
[19354.16s -> 19356.16s]  The matriarch is ill
[19356.32s -> 19357.84s]  Just look at her
[19357.84s -> 19359.84s]  You have to find the antidote drake
[19360.56s -> 19366.96s]  Relax just jesus with the spear has the antidote in a diamond shaped vial. It's blue
[19367.60s -> 19373.28s]  Get it and bring it back quickly to our beloved matriarch. I have no idea what's happening in this world
[19374.08s -> 19377.72s]  Oh, what is the matriarch?
[19377.98s -> 19380.22s]  You have to look for the leader drake
[19380.70s -> 19385.58s]  Hurry the matriarch is what did we miss a very important piece of history in this world?
[19386.54s -> 19398.38s]  Please get it
[19398.38s -> 19400.38s]  Yeah, and why is it?
[19400.72s -> 19402.80s]  Uh, I don't even get me going on this bullshit
[19404.35s -> 19406.93s]  I ever everyone wanted to take their game so seriously
[19407.71s -> 19414.24s]  No, no, no, we can't have anything like funny or fun or interesting or like not realistic in our like wrestling game
[19414.32s -> 19416.00s]  It's got to be a fucking
[19416.00s -> 19420.40s]  Guy with underwear on simulation where you like simulate wrestling and it's real
[19422.40s -> 19424.40s]  No, no, no, you have to go for a first down
[19425.36s -> 19428.18s]  Touchdown got it real. This is a real simulation
[19431.05s -> 19435.69s]  Give me the fucked up shit again. It was stuff was so fucked up. You could just do whatever you wanted
[19435.69s -> 19438.08s]  It was so much more fun
[19438.08s -> 19442.80s]  I don't want to pretend i'm playing a game of football. I want to drop kick somebody in the head
[19443.36s -> 19445.76s]  while they're running for a touchdown and then I want them to like
[19446.64s -> 19448.64s]  Just roundhouse kick me in the stomach
[19449.20s -> 19453.76s]  And have a fumble happen and then we both have to fist fight to get the ball. That's fucking fun
[19454.32s -> 19457.76s]  I don't want to sit there and play a fake pretend game of football
[19458.40s -> 19471.28s]  And everyone's saying blood bowl but blood bowl isn't blood bowl like a turn-based strategy game. It's not what i'm looking for
[19478.60s -> 19480.04s]  I want an nba street
[19480.04s -> 19482.68s]  You could do these crazy moves where the ball went under your leg
[19482.68s -> 19483.48s]  They went behind your back
[19483.48s -> 19486.84s]  You did like a backflip and then you did a huge slam dunk before you slam dunked
[19487.08s -> 19489.24s]  Right before the ball went in the net you passed it to your teammate
[19489.40s -> 19493.00s]  You were in the air then he goes in the air you pass it back to the guy that goes into the air
[19493.16s -> 19496.12s]  And he did two front flip slam dunks and it was like four million points
[19497.36s -> 19500.00s]  I loved it. It was like uh, tony hawke. It was like tony hawke with sports
[19500.80s -> 19504.38s]  Where am I? What am I doing?
[19504.38s -> 19517.16s]  How do I get over there? You're ranting
[19518.16s -> 19521.84s]  Yeah, I know I am because like what have they done?
[19523.04s -> 19525.04s]  To sports video games
[19525.12s -> 19534.97s]  I was supposed to switch games. Oh, right, right, right
[19535.45s -> 19545.04s]  What I just do
[19545.04s -> 19547.04s]  I want a wrestling game and you know, I'm
[19547.36s -> 19549.92s]  I want a wrestling game where the rules can be crazy
[19551.00s -> 19554.92s]  Like I want the ring to be covered in ice and just have ai fight each other and see what they do
[19556.35s -> 19558.83s]  You know, how fun would that be it'd be fun just to do that
[19568.11s -> 19572.91s]  And then you got wwe and wwe the last wwe 2k game was so fucking awful
[19573.23s -> 19575.95s]  That they stopped making it for like two years because they were like, holy shit
[19575.95s -> 19577.95s]  We gotta like try to make this even remotely good
[19579.23s -> 19580.83s]  I hope they do
[19580.83s -> 19587.04s]  I hope they go back
[19587.04s -> 19590.48s]  And do it the old the way that it was done like six or seven years ago
[19597.69s -> 19603.13s]  And that's not boomer. This is not like oh the way things are used to be I'm talking about like five years ago
[19603.21s -> 19606.75s]  Not like 20. We're talking like five or six years ago
[19616.43s -> 19618.43s]  This game is awful
[19623.55s -> 19625.55s]  Like i'm talking like 2014
[19625.69s -> 19628.24s]  2013
[19628.24s -> 19632.56s]  How long ago was that it was like seven years ago, but whatever you get it. It's not that long ago. It's within 10 years
[19633.28s -> 19642.52s]  Why are you still playing it?
[19642.52s -> 19645.96s]  Well, because it's I don't know. It's a it's a means to deliver my rant to you
[19646.52s -> 19648.84s]  It's not a means to deliver a gameplay video
[19649.40s -> 19653.76s]  Well, what am I putting in next? Let me see watch this shitty
[19653.76s -> 19657.68s]  Cussing outside or drug you and drake here retrieve the antidote
[19658.32s -> 19660.80s]  I am very grateful to you drake
[19661.52s -> 19663.68s]  I know it is not much but
[19664.40s -> 19668.26s]  Except these gauntlets as a small sign of my appreciation
[19669.28s -> 19672.10s]  They will help protect your hands and forearms
[19673.12s -> 19675.12s]  I hate to be a bother
[19675.20s -> 19680.32s]  But if you are on your way back to the forest i would appreciate it
[19680.40s -> 19687.46s]  If you could bring this eggshell extract to the herbalist there, I am sure she will reward you for its delivery
[19696.97s -> 19700.03s]  Deliver the eggshell extract to the herbalist at the forest outpost
[19701.05s -> 19704.41s]  Well, I have to play this because otherwise, what am I ever gonna play this again?
[19705.37s -> 19707.37s]  There's no reason to I have it
[19707.61s -> 19712.14s]  This game's terrible. We thought there was gonna be a t-rex and shit and it's not it's just like
[19713.56s -> 19715.56s]  Talking animals the game
[19716.28s -> 19719.26s]  All right. Here we go
[19719.26s -> 19723.58s]  Uh turns out I did not throw it in the trash. I have it right here
[19724.22s -> 19726.40s]  And if there's ever gonna be like an xbox
[19727.12s -> 19729.12s]  dog shit grab bag night
[19729.36s -> 19731.36s]  This is the time to do this
[19731.87s -> 19733.55s]  So let's put it in
[19733.55s -> 19760.67s]  It's halo 2
[19768.43s -> 19788.97s]  Come on load
[19788.97s -> 19794.57s]  It's the other one the one that I thought I threw in the trash turns out it's right here
[19809.24s -> 19810.92s]  single player
[19810.92s -> 19812.60s]  Great character
[19812.60s -> 19820.09s]  Aren't you the king have it your way customize your character
[19820.73s -> 19825.50s]  Like am I I go ahead pickles and relish and mustard to my character like on the shirt
[19826.06s -> 19847.28s]  Okay, select character. How is this customizing? I'll be brett
[19848.36s -> 19852.22s]  hair hat helmet
[19852.22s -> 19865.12s]  You really want to save what this is not this is just just I don't why even put this in
[19865.76s -> 19874.08s]  I need to make like a lettuce tomato
[19875.56s -> 19887.87s]  Like pickles it's the joker your name for your character
[19890.04s -> 19891.16s]  I don't
[19891.16s -> 19898.33s]  Didn't you already have a name?
[19898.39s -> 19916.43s]  Arthur no, I don't care about this. I'm gonna play this for 15 minutes. Why I know I don't need to make him
[19916.99s -> 19927.96s]  I've done a name him. You're gonna forget about him tomorrow. You made jeff hardy. He does look like jeff hardy
[19939.52s -> 19941.52s]  Are you so i'm not angry what are you talking about?
[19953.48s -> 19956.36s]  I can't believe you said this is gonna be halo 2
[19967.37s -> 19969.37s]  Uh rides rides
[19972.11s -> 19975.45s]  Garage, all right. My car is gonna be green one
[19976.89s -> 19982.99s]  And then rides the broiler the deep king's court. All right, we're gonna go to king's court
[19984.11s -> 19989.34s]  You'll probably guess the way this is played to hit the puck into your opponent's goal
[19989.82s -> 19992.22s]  Wait, this did they make rocket league before rocket league?
[19992.94s -> 19996.97s]  This would be wild if this is what this is
[19997.13s -> 20020.73s]  This is rocket league chicken
[20023.64s -> 20026.68s]  I didn't even take a character. What who am I what team am I on?
[20027.40s -> 20036.43s]  I'm on red team. I just won
[20038.52s -> 20040.36s]  You're always the king
[20040.36s -> 20043.32s]  Well, what's the point of customizing a character if I always have to play as the king?
[20048.78s -> 20050.86s]  This looks like the floor of a public bathroom. I'll just tell you
[20056.14s -> 20062.43s]  What do you mean own goal
[20062.43s -> 20065.63s]  You can choose the characters. I don't care to choose the characters

[20099.08s -> 20101.08s]  I got one more. I want to play tonight
[20101.16s -> 20108.28s]  And this one could be really good and I mean very like incredible it's possible we'll see I have high hopes for the final game

[21440.59s -> 21447.45s]  I'm going curveball dropping out of the zone. Oops breaking ball called. I have a turbo meter. How do I use it?
[21448.25s -> 21455.32s]  Throw a perfect game for a billion off the debt. I don't think I could throw a perfect game
[21455.80s -> 21462.91s]  I think it's possible. I'll try i'll try it. Can I get that as a deal? I'll try
[21464.75s -> 21467.71s]  Oh my god. No, no, I want to use that. I don't want to use that. How do I take that off?
[21469.31s -> 21479.34s]  How do I take off the turbo mode deal? All right, i'm gonna really try what what's the counter?
[21479.98s -> 21482.62s]  Three and two. All right, i'm gonna throw a change up right out here
[21487.72s -> 21491.55s]  That's not a perfect game fielder is automatically selected for you
[21492.28s -> 21494.84s]  Run him towards the ball and he will make the catch if he is close enough
[21497.08s -> 21498.94s]  Did you choose a base?
[21498.94s -> 21500.94s]  All right, how about a no hitter? How about a no hitter?
[21502.84s -> 21508.62s]  Because yeah, that's not a perfect game right perfect game. Well, I actually know it is throw the ball base press the action. Yeah
[21516.99s -> 21524.56s]  No one has to no one can make it to first base. Okay, wait, I thought the hot light
[21524.64s -> 21530.88s]  I've been pitching it in their hot zones. We go
[21532.24s -> 21534.24s]  Doers don't understand baseball
[21535.64s -> 21539.88s]  Dude, why don't do this shit? You're right. You want to get us to be interested in sports again?
[21541.05s -> 21542.57s]  They gotta like get
[21542.57s -> 21549.16s]  Yep, well just hold off. I'm working on it. Okay, i'm working on it
[21549.40s -> 21560.68s]  I'm working on it. It was supposed to be there a year ago. I'm working on it. Just wait right here
[21563.52s -> 21567.87s]  perfect pitch
[21567.87s -> 21572.51s]  Last august I was supposed to do a stream and just wait. All right, i'm fucking working on it
[21572.59s -> 21574.59s]  It's gonna be it's gonna be my favorite stream ever
[21575.48s -> 21578.20s]  It will be the my most favorite thing i've ever done
[21579.53s -> 21587.10s]  On youtube twitch doesn't matter. It'll be my favorite thing i've ever done strike three sit down
[21587.66s -> 21596.73s]  I got here. Perfect game is intact
[21596.73s -> 21600.19s]  All right time to get time to win
[21600.27s -> 21602.27s]  sponge ball
[21602.43s -> 21604.43s]  Great approach in the play, okay hit the ball
[21606.59s -> 21610.35s]  Aim your hit into the field and do a contact swing for a good chance at a hit
[21610.75s -> 21612.75s]  Allowing hits will cause the pitcher's effectiveness to decrease
[21613.31s -> 21616.68s]  All right. Well, how do we do a power swing?
[21620.62s -> 21625.18s]  Direct your runner towards the base that you want to go to use the base radar to see where you are
[21625.50s -> 21627.50s]  So, okay left stick aim towards the base you want to go to
[21628.62s -> 21630.22s]  That's a double
[21630.22s -> 21633.61s]  No, it's not no, it's not stay back
[21635.29s -> 21637.47s]  What's the power swing
[21637.95s -> 21639.23s]  Who's this
[21639.23s -> 21644.57s]  Okay, first thing i was like what cartoon character is this guy?
[21647.05s -> 21652.89s]  Aim your hit into the field and execute a bunt bunting moves your bad. I'm not sacrificing bunting. Why would I do that?
[21655.38s -> 21657.38s]  sacrifice bunt
[21658.33s -> 21659.21s]  Up there
[21659.21s -> 21661.21s]  That's the he just I just hit into a double play shit
[21665.90s -> 21669.98s]  Go go. What are you doing? What if you run the second base run the second base?
[21678.25s -> 21681.05s]  Wait isn't I've only been this happy in clothes once
[21681.05s -> 21687.52s]  All right power swing seems you're gonna hit a home run right now over the monster
[21691.10s -> 21696.38s]  Okay, left bumper is move all your runners the next position. Yes, that's what I want get down it. Everybody go
[21706.40s -> 21714.60s]  All right, here's a random person steal you have to first initiate a lead-off. Okay, who should I steal with?
[21717.76s -> 21721.92s]  It's a hit and run get in
[21723.90s -> 21725.90s]  Timpy is here. Why is Timpy so big?
[21728.16s -> 21732.24s]  For a second. I did not know who this was. I was like who is this weird ant character
[21736.80s -> 21738.40s]  shit
[21738.40s -> 21741.60s]  How weak is uh is ren?
[21743.55s -> 21745.55s]  Timmy get up why is Timmy sleeping?
[21762.83s -> 21770.06s]  Shit it's all right. This really does look like a gta mod
[21770.06s -> 21774.99s]  What
[21785.06s -> 21790.00s]  I can't get over. Okay, perfect game. Come on. I gotta throw a perfect game
[21797.09s -> 21802.61s]  All the time it would take to do this it would take so much time to make a gta mod like this
[21802.61s -> 21805.81s]  And why would you do this?
[21810.14s -> 21812.14s]  Oh, I need to build my meter
[21819.01s -> 21821.01s]  Who the fuck is the pitcher?
[21821.89s -> 21824.05s]  That's powdered toast man
[21825.15s -> 21829.38s]  Let's strike out
[21839.50s -> 21842.94s]  The pitcher is spongebob. Why would you think that?
[21854.02s -> 21862.43s]  All right, I gotta settle down I need to get a perfect game. Oh shit. He just turbo mode
[21862.99s -> 21865.39s]  Uh-oh. I'm I'm counter turboing
[21867.49s -> 21869.49s]  Eat shit motherfucker
[21871.23s -> 21875.89s]  Yes
[21875.89s -> 21877.89s]  Uh-oh david ortiz
[21880.16s -> 21883.60s]  Oh, I was gonna say why don't I get david ortiz? He's gonna hit a home run
[21889.41s -> 21891.41s]  Stay away from david ortiz
[21893.63s -> 21895.49s]  Oh, no
[21895.49s -> 21896.85s]  It's a foul ball
[21896.85s -> 21899.60s]  It's i'm good. It's a foul ball
[21899.84s -> 21909.95s]  only one in one
[21909.95s -> 21911.63s]  Curveball in the dirt. Let's go
[21911.63s -> 21916.34s]  Come on swing at that david ortiz had so much trouble hitting curveballs down
[21919.78s -> 21922.14s]  again

[21925.02s -> 21927.02s]  Come on swing at it
[21929.30s -> 21930.74s]  Oh, i'm in trouble
[21930.74s -> 21942.67s]  I'm good. If you feel I can't make the catch switch to the fielder with the next best chances left trigger
[21943.62s -> 21945.62s]  Oh gas
[21945.78s -> 21947.86s]  And everyone told me did not put gas on team
[21948.74s -> 21950.98s]  You see how fast that she just threw that ball
[21953.22s -> 21957.94s]  Oh get gas off the team who's gas who omega low, okay you who and now
[21960.24s -> 21962.24s]  What's this shit?

[22044.99s -> 22052.40s]  How's part of tostman doing?
[22055.71s -> 22059.81s]  Can I warm somebody up part of tostman for s knight?

[22063.41s -> 22070.18s]  No, it has to stay as it has to it has to stay
[22071.62s -> 22073.62s]  As part of toastman, otherwise, it's not a perfect game

[22089.02s -> 22093.82s]  Change up down change up down and away. It's the longest you have to wait for a pitch got it
[22097.04s -> 22099.04s]  I'm safe
[22099.68s -> 22108.70s]  I can't throw a ball when he's in turbo mode. All right two strikes
[22109.18s -> 22113.92s]  Are you getting this from curveball in the dirt? It's gonna fucking swing and miss
[22115.44s -> 22117.74s]  I'm not gonna chase that low

[22163.25s -> 22165.55s]  Of course, it was patrick that did it
[22171.02s -> 22174.06s]  You lost to patrick, you're not adding debt. What do you mean?
[22181.04s -> 22184.24s]  He's lying touch me so bad. He's making errors in the field
[22185.04s -> 22187.28s]  Her bow hit activated. Oh, no. Okay. Um

[22213.63s -> 22216.19s]  Inside for a strike
[22217.31s -> 22222.91s]  Okay, keep in mind the flying they used two of their turbos on the flying dutchman and he's gonna swing and miss right now
[22225.41s -> 22226.85s]  absolutely pathetic
[22226.85s -> 22228.85s]  What a waste of two meters

[22281.33s -> 22287.92s]  To try to get to that ball
[22287.92s -> 22291.70s]  Why did you do that?
[22291.70s -> 22295.54s]  There was someone you could have caught that normally you didn't have to jump across the whole game
[22297.15s -> 22299.55s]  This reminds me of the movie angels in the outfield
[22303.50s -> 22308.37s]  All right. It's all right
[22308.37s -> 22318.22s]  That happens in angels in the outfield advance the third. It's all right. All right. I gotta go on third

[22338.82s -> 22341.76s]  Looks like an ant
[22356.77s -> 22359.49s]  I can't believe I didn't get a shutout. That sucks
[22360.13s -> 22363.73s]  Look at all these perfect pitches perfect two-seam fastballs. Nobody can keep up with me
[22364.37s -> 22373.49s]  Let's go change up change up right down the middle let's fucking just let's fuck with them
[22374.13s -> 22381.07s]  Cut out still in yeah, perfect. Yeah, that's what I mean. Perfect game is off
[22384.69s -> 22386.69s]  This is so fun
[22387.81s -> 22394.05s]  So fun and then and then that no simulation. It's not real doesn't have to be real. It's just fun
[22402.56s -> 22411.10s]  Split-fingered out of the way mario super sluggers is better
[22411.82s -> 22416.14s]  They're all good
[22416.14s -> 22418.14s]  You know how much shit you talk with your friends when you play these games
[22421.07s -> 22425.55s]  I got more invested and it was so dead serious and so invested
[22426.19s -> 22428.83s]  Playing these cartoon baseball games against friends on the couch
[22429.84s -> 22442.88s]  Than anything else than any real baseball game. Let's get back to the game mario super strikers makes me livid
[22443.52s -> 22449.41s]  directory here it is
[22449.41s -> 22451.01s]  right to
[22451.01s -> 22452.93s]  mario strikers on the gamecube
[22452.93s -> 22458.06s]  That game is awesome
[22458.06s -> 22461.97s]  Paint it right on the edge
[22463.17s -> 22468.98s]  I almost have a full meter if I get a full meter is a guaranteed home run
[22469.62s -> 22475.66s]  That's what i'm waiting for
[22475.66s -> 22483.57s]  Character every time I see him it makes me angry tapping in for the second time. All right. Yes. Here we go

[22545.22s -> 22554.54s]  There's only one more inning kind of fun
[22561.22s -> 22566.46s]  Oh, they're so bad
[22567.34s -> 22568.70s]  A little bunk
[22568.70s -> 22570.70s]  All right sponge ball put it in the seat
[22578.46s -> 22580.46s]  Come on. That was right down the middle. It was not too late
[22581.34s -> 22585.46s]  That's down the line

[22647.34s -> 22659.44s]  You have to pick a different team
[22659.44s -> 22661.52s]  Or is it just random like a random pool of the characters?
[22668.67s -> 22675.79s]  Here he is patrick
[22675.79s -> 22677.15s]  only reason

[22917.44s -> 22924.54s]  All right, here we go

[22939.52s -> 22941.52s]  It's 90 this thing goes up to 95

[23109.48s -> 23111.48s]  If you don't know who alex rodriguez is
[23113.84s -> 23116.00s]  Then we are not in the same generation
[23118.28s -> 23121.48s]  At all i'm probably like i'm probably like 15 plus years older than you
[23121.96s -> 23125.27s]  Which is weird to think about that in it. It's very strange
[23132.48s -> 23140.32s]  I want to unlock the areal monsters who watches sports anymore. I mean I don't

[23148.60s -> 23160.50s]  I got stimpy this time. Maybe he's got a lot of power
[23162.10s -> 23166.08s]  Nobody can hit this ball. Why is larry the lobster that color?
[23169.01s -> 23176.37s]  Was it red kill bill
[23179.01s -> 23181.91s]  Zero zero zero, this is what a boring game of baseball

[23247.88s -> 23251.32s]  Of puppies in the game, but fairly odd parents aren't I think they are
[23252.04s -> 23263.57s]  I think that's just the yeah. Why is larry the lobster looks ridiculous. That looks really just awful
[23264.45s -> 23269.54s]  It looks like a whoopee cushion
[23269.54s -> 23278.37s]  Oh you want to do that? That's fine
[23278.37s -> 23281.83s]  I'll get it right down the middle for you. Look

[23304.36s -> 23308.22s]  Ladder open it. I think yaks the best picture
[23314.10s -> 23319.33s]  Says it's a ball in tip drag up
[23321.17s -> 23326.26s]  Nobody can keep up with this. I want to check out the tournament after this
[23326.34s -> 23333.99s]  I want to see if I can unlock people
[23333.99s -> 23337.89s]  The yak is juicing
[23338.13s -> 23341.49s]  Yeah, so wouldn't probably every single person you've seen on the screen so far
[23342.76s -> 23343.88s]  real people

[23348.36s -> 23350.36s]  for like 2006
[23351.04s -> 23353.76s]  Almost every single baseball player was on some kind of drug
[23355.72s -> 23358.94s]  like 1998 to like 2005 2007
[23362.13s -> 23364.13s]  Oh, he looks so weird
[23376.37s -> 23380.53s]  Finally some action

[23408.53s -> 23416.28s]  back to back
[23416.69s -> 23418.05s]  Take that back

[23531.92s -> 23533.92s]  Settle down. What the fuck is wrong with me?
[23536.16s -> 23538.32s]  This player is over one on the day
[23546.18s -> 23548.18s]  Chill out venom
[23551.25s -> 23554.92s]  Uh, that one hurt that one hurt
[23568.42s -> 23574.24s]  You're a psycho you like fanboy chum chum. I know I didn't hate that show
[23576.26s -> 23586.18s]  I kind of did but I didn't like the john travolta character. I thought was just annoying
[23587.12s -> 23589.36s]  Yeah, the guy who's talking like this he was like a bully
[23590.32s -> 23592.32s]  He was like, you gotta get away from me
[23592.56s -> 23594.56s]  That was really bad john travolta
[23594.80s -> 23596.32s]  whatever
[23596.32s -> 23605.22s]  But that's it. I don't like that character. He was the best. No, it was it was I don't know. I don't like him
[23605.70s -> 23609.67s]  I like chum chum
[23609.67s -> 23611.67s]  Chum chum, I love chum chum's voice
[23619.32s -> 23621.43s]  This show is trash
[23621.43s -> 23627.83s]  That's how I feel internally what you just said about how what you just said
[23636.82s -> 23638.82s]  Down the line. All right, go go go go. That's at least two
[23641.40s -> 23645.54s]  That wasn't
[23645.54s -> 23648.34s]  Remember was a 27 year old man when chum chum first aired

[23692.32s -> 23694.32s]  It was like a cute character
[23694.32s -> 23698.00s]  It's like a little like oh, he's cute. They like they like frosty freezies
[23698.88s -> 23702.40s]  I didn't buy chum chum merchandise. I thought the show was like cute
[23707.20s -> 23714.08s]  I saw like four episodes total. I was sick with the flu one day. Sorry
[23729.73s -> 23734.42s]  Unforgivable
[23734.42s -> 23737.86s]  Don't do that. I'll just do it too. Let's go for a challenge here up and in
[23748.32s -> 23751.20s]  This is it I win the game after this

[23760.28s -> 23762.28s]  That's not for you old man
[23787.73s -> 23789.33s]  It's a perfect game
[23789.33s -> 23791.33s]  Um, I think it is what?
[23791.89s -> 23800.98s]  There was no bet
[23800.98s -> 23802.98s]  Shit, why didn't I not do it for this game?
[23809.92s -> 23811.92s]  Play it on hard. Okay

[23843.22s -> 23845.30s]  Just all right, this one's for all the marbles guys
[23846.02s -> 23857.78s]  Okay, this is not all-star we're doing nine innings if I win this game
[23858.50s -> 23860.95s]  I get 500 million off the debt
[23861.75s -> 23865.94s]  If I lose this game
[23865.94s -> 23867.70s]  500 million gets added
[23867.70s -> 23874.42s]  This is it. This is this is a big one
[23874.42s -> 23888.16s]  Okay home team

[23898.74s -> 23902.28s]  You know just to make it fair versus like the comeback kids
[23902.60s -> 23905.59s]  Come back kids pick your starting pitcher
[23906.31s -> 23915.67s]  Okay, as is pitch in this game pick your first basement
[23921.67s -> 23923.67s]  All right first baseman's gotta be
[23923.83s -> 23929.19s]  I think i'm gonna take patrick
[23929.43s -> 23933.59s]  Your second face
[23933.59s -> 23935.17s]  Hmm
[23935.17s -> 23939.52s]  Chum chum
[23939.52s -> 23941.46s]  I gotta go with what I want
[23941.46s -> 23945.70s]  Third basement, I would pick danny phantom, but I don't that's I don't like that show

[23951.62s -> 23953.22s]  sandy
[23953.22s -> 23965.22s]  Sandy
[23965.22s -> 23966.90s]  No, no
[23966.90s -> 23968.18s]  No arm
[23968.18s -> 23970.66s]  Get third base gotta be somebody with a strong arm. It's gotta be sandy
[23972.37s -> 23981.62s]  Pick your shortstop. I'm ready. This is it. This is the team
[23982.34s -> 23986.23s]  This is the team for me to win this and we're gonna play
[23987.19s -> 23989.43s]  at
[23989.43s -> 23993.20s]  Danny phantom arena
[23993.76s -> 24009.00s]  This is a lot riding on here and this this is an all-star difficulty. We've got nine innings
[24014.08s -> 24016.08s]  Now i'm no longer playing for fun
[24021.33s -> 24026.47s]  All right sponge bob I should have picked sponge bob that was a mistake all right gas has a cutter
[24031.67s -> 24033.03s]  Oh my god
[24033.03s -> 24035.27s]  Gas is even cooler. She throws submarine
[24037.30s -> 24039.54s]  Even cooler. She throws submarine
[24040.18s -> 24046.63s]  And look at the ghost trail
[24046.63s -> 24048.96s]  sinker
[24048.96s -> 24051.28s]  Hey steady diet of sinkers means ground balls all game
[24058.45s -> 24059.73s]  All right, that's two
[24059.73s -> 24064.40s]  Steady diet of sinkers low
[24064.56s -> 24068.71s]  Ground balls all game
[24068.71s -> 24075.24s]  Shit full count
[24082.23s -> 24086.61s]  Victory screwball, you know, you know what a screwball is
[24087.01s -> 24089.92s]  Screwball is a curve ball that goes the other way
[24090.56s -> 24093.92s]  And you have to spin the baseball the other way you have to move your wrist
[24094.32s -> 24097.20s]  You have to flick your wrist to the left if you're a right-handed pitcher
[24098.16s -> 24102.88s]  If you throw a screwball, you just fuck up your elbow. Everybody's ever thrown a screwball has tons of problems
[24103.89s -> 24108.13s]  Because you do with a curve ball you come down and you spin kind of you the ball you spin
[24108.29s -> 24110.29s]  You're to the right side if you're a right-handed pitcher
[24111.01s -> 24114.37s]  You have to flick your wrist like left while you throw as hard as you can
[24114.93s -> 24119.33s]  To have the ball go the other direction a screwball is a curve ball that goes the other way
[24121.24s -> 24123.67s]  It breaks the other way
[24123.91s -> 24128.84s]  It literally fucks up your whole body
[24128.84s -> 24135.89s]  I think there's only like five people in major league baseball that's ever actually thrown a screwball because it's guaranteed to break you
[24142.79s -> 24144.79s]  I don't care about baseball lore
[24145.52s -> 24147.04s]  Oh danny phantom
[24147.04s -> 24152.45s]  Rolled at his head
[24152.45s -> 24154.50s]  Come on computer
[24154.50s -> 24156.50s]  Computer is not one in this game
[24158.45s -> 24160.85s]  Focus I have money on the line. I what about me?
[24161.57s -> 24174.56s]  I got ice stand to want to win this too. Let's get back to the action cutter up and in in the strike zone
[24181.43s -> 24184.69s]  Patrick don't power
[24191.44s -> 24193.44s]  We all have money on the line
[24194.84s -> 24197.41s]  m cannon
[24197.41s -> 24202.93s]  Oh part of toast man is so hard. It's a 70 mile per hour curve ball and it arcs from 12 to six
[24204.44s -> 24211.44s]  Oh, he's so good
[24211.44s -> 24213.44s]  Oh, it's so hard to hit that
[24215.46s -> 24216.42s]  Really?
[24216.42s -> 24220.12s]  Let's go
[24220.12s -> 24223.06s]  No
[24223.70s -> 24226.07s]  That's fine
[24231.16s -> 24243.09s]  The part of toast man's so good, why did I not pick part of toast man? Stop swinging at balls
[24245.33s -> 24254.00s]  That's like being in the corner of boxer and going. Hey, stop getting punched in the face. It's not as easy as you think it is
[24263.67s -> 24274.77s]  It's fine. It's fine. How did you bet on me? You bet on me because i'm gonna win
[24275.81s -> 24288.45s]  How do you dive? How do you dive? How do you dive? I don't know, but I got it
[24293.80s -> 24306.15s]  Oh god, he's so good. He's probably the best character
[24317.56s -> 24319.73s]  It's all right, how do you die?
[24320.37s -> 24326.05s]  I didn't I have to know how to dive
[24326.05s -> 24328.74s]  batting running pitching
[24329.46s -> 24345.06s]  Fielding turbo turbo defense feeling we just dive. I mean, there's definitely a dive. We've seen people do it
[24345.38s -> 24361.40s]  People have done it. We've seen people does it automatic. Is it a it's a button
[24362.44s -> 24368.07s]  Oh, it's action. Okay
[24368.07s -> 24373.08s]  I person person on first we got it. How many else one out?
[24374.36s -> 24378.45s]  Going for a double play writer
[24380.93s -> 24386.90s]  Double play way behind it
[24397.60s -> 24405.14s]  Split it down and in ground ball that pitch is taken counts two and two
[24406.26s -> 24407.54s]  Oh no
[24407.54s -> 24409.91s]  Um, oh shit somebody on base
[24417.25s -> 24422.78s]  Yes, I can't hit anything that was huge
[24425.16s -> 24433.64s]  That was one of the biggest plays the whole game I can do this still okay two outs
[24433.64s -> 24435.32s]  I don't have to worry about a ground ball
[24435.32s -> 24437.72s]  Take a chase
[24437.72s -> 24440.53s]  What do you say? What am I talking to?
[24453.36s -> 24456.48s]  All right, rand's gonna strike out right here, you're gonna leave a man on
[24461.76s -> 24463.76s]  What that's right on the corner that's
[24464.16s -> 24474.34s]  What the fuck is going on? I hate american sports
[24476.55s -> 24479.19s]  What? I mean, this is nicktoons baseball
[24479.91s -> 24487.40s]  It's a little different
[24489.01s -> 24494.68s]  All right, here's all you need to know about american baseball get out
[24496.32s -> 24499.44s]  Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go slide
[24500.63s -> 24503.51s]  All right. Here we go. This is it. Yeah, nice hit
[24504.31s -> 24507.11s]  Uh pitcher throws ball batter tries to hit ball
[24507.99s -> 24510.23s]  If you catch ball in air batter sit down
[24510.95s -> 24513.83s]  If ball on ground and batter not make two base
[24514.47s -> 24516.84s]  Well, let me hit a fucking home run real quick
[24524.29s -> 24528.63s]  On second i'm not gonna swing at a turbo pitch
[24529.43s -> 24532.84s]  now
[24532.84s -> 24534.84s]  Oh, that could be that's a run
[24535.75s -> 24537.75s]  Come on. You're so slow. Why are you so slow?
[24539.38s -> 24540.82s]  Get the third
[24540.82s -> 24542.40s]  Oh
[24542.40s -> 24545.86s]  Yes in the lead
[24551.44s -> 24555.80s]  How much power do you got? Oh my god, this is huge. This would be it
[24558.71s -> 24563.91s]  Get in there. That's another run. Imagine imagine betting a go to what are you doing?
[24564.55s -> 24568.42s]  What the fuck happened?
[24568.42s -> 24572.26s]  What just happened?
[24572.66s -> 24574.66s]  Why do they go back?
[24584.79s -> 24587.27s]  No, okay, all right, all right, all right, all right, it's it's going out one out
[24587.83s -> 24593.27s]  It's a ball. Don't swing it balls, right?
[24597.17s -> 24599.17s]  Oh, that's so slow. Good thing. I touched it
[24603.88s -> 24605.94s]  No
[24605.94s -> 24608.31s]  Relax, it's fine
[24608.31s -> 24610.55s]  Why did I panic turbo? That was stupid
[24616.39s -> 24625.65s]  Okay
[24625.65s -> 24631.46s]  What are you talking about? I want where's the replay?
[24633.40s -> 24641.57s]  Don't think that has anything to do with the game. I want to see the replay. How did I get?
[24641.89s -> 24647.99s]  Are we there yet? Nobody tagged me. What are you getting this from? Okay. Why does this person have full power in everything?
[24648.15s -> 24652.31s]  They're not even in nicktoon
[24652.31s -> 24654.95s]  Painting the corners there. That's a strike
[24655.43s -> 24666.37s]  All is smashed to deep center, right?
[24667.75s -> 24671.99s]  It's two to one who is that person? Why do they have full power in everything?
[24678.85s -> 24682.05s]  What is going on with this? What is this? What is this?
[24683.16s -> 24694.55s]  full everything
[24695.19s -> 24697.19s]  That's so unfair
[24699.03s -> 24711.36s]  All right, fine. I'm not gonna let it get to me up and in we miss let's get back to the action
[24714.80s -> 24717.52s]  How come they have that that's the two or three people in a row?
[24723.56s -> 24725.56s]  Ha ha ha burritos
[24735.83s -> 24737.83s]  Take a spongebob
[24738.79s -> 24743.73s]  A spongebob is even spongebob has a ton of wait a minute
[24745.06s -> 24759.64s]  I think gaz is tired
[24759.64s -> 24763.62s]  Gaz is tired. All right, we're gonna switch it. Uh, yeah. No, wait a minute
[24768.98s -> 24770.98s]  Is that accurate? It's only this third inning
[24771.46s -> 24778.45s]  There's no time to pretend. No, look at the stars down there. Spongebob has like two extra stars
[24779.67s -> 24784.08s]  Why look at the stars?
[24787.65s -> 24795.09s]  It's because it's on all-star difficulty. Oh, is that what it is?
[24796.80s -> 24803.24s]  Painting the corners there. That's a strike. Well, I don't know. It's the first time I've played on all-star
[24810.45s -> 24815.89s]  This is like insane
[24815.89s -> 24817.89s]  Yeah
[24821.12s -> 24823.60s]  I would use the power up right now, but i'm not gonna I don't have faith
[24824.24s -> 24842.29s]  You're not gonna hit shit
[24842.29s -> 24844.29s]  That was a great pitch too
[24844.53s -> 24845.73s]  down
[24845.73s -> 24847.57s]  Perfect throw cutter
[24847.57s -> 24854.13s]  Look at how bad danny phantom's tv show is even on all-star mode
[24854.69s -> 24872.61s]  look at those stats on the edge people like
[24873.75s -> 24876.28s]  Danny phantom
[24876.28s -> 24878.28s]  I thought danny phantom. I thought people didn't like this show
[24879.32s -> 24885.91s]  How's that a ball?
[24885.91s -> 24887.91s]  Maybe you could use a little rest girl
[24888.47s -> 24890.71s]  Oh my god, how are these balls don't walk anybody?
[24906.58s -> 24909.62s]  Yes, what?
[24909.62s -> 24911.62s]  No, do you know where I put that?
[24912.90s -> 24919.43s]  Oh, come on. All right. I got it's two outs. Just get him. Just hit just get it out
[24923.91s -> 24927.35s]  It's a classic. It's as classic as spider-man dude. All right
[24929.48s -> 24931.48s]  What the fuck did you just do got a third?
[24940.37s -> 24943.97s]  Why what just happened?
[24943.97s -> 24948.37s]  How did you miss that? Oh now it goes the yak. Oh, this is horrible. This is not good
[24948.85s -> 24955.24s]  Someone can get that right
[24955.24s -> 24960.52s]  No
[24960.52s -> 24962.76s]  What the fuck? All right. I gotta lock in next next
[24964.05s -> 24966.93s]  What the hell? How do you hit that ball? It was the dirt
[24970.05s -> 24972.96s]  Please
[24972.96s -> 24977.92s]  It's all right the gates. We're in the third inning everybody sit down and relax patrick's coming up right now
[24981.40s -> 24987.03s]  I swung so late
[24987.03s -> 24988.87s]  Fuck he's throwing so fast
[24988.87s -> 24995.51s]  All right, patrick get us back in the game
[24995.51s -> 24998.90s]  single
[24999.80s -> 25009.60s]  My points my points, it's five to two. It's not like 40 to zero. He didn't get it. He didn't get it
[25010.66s -> 25022.42s]  slide
[25022.42s -> 25024.90s]  No, don't hit do a double play you motherfucker
[25025.62s -> 25030.53s]  Oh shit
[25031.17s -> 25033.17s]  No, all right, everything's fine
[25034.13s -> 25037.33s]  It's the fourth inning. I got a lot. It's a lot of baseball left to play. All right
[25043.72s -> 25062.80s]  Let's get back to the game over the first almost didn't get him get him out of first base
[25069.04s -> 25074.66s]  Yeah
[25094.82s -> 25101.34s]  I'm all right. That was just an emotion that just burst it out of me. Oh my god. It's all falling apart
[25112.53s -> 25115.03s]  Shut up you fucking little weirdo
[25123.51s -> 25126.07s]  Why did you throw it into the stands?
[25127.59s -> 25130.95s]  I have to get a strikeout right now or it's our admin in a lot of trouble
[25144.85s -> 25150.93s]  Shit i'm okay. I i'm may as well be playing sakiro right now. I need to fucking relax
[25161.52s -> 25168.47s]  Yeah, this is gonna she's gonna come out of the game she's too tired
[25179.59s -> 25185.48s]  She's too tired i gotta bring somebody in
[25186.69s -> 25206.53s]  God damn it. I'm just building his meter up. That's right. That's stupid air horn. That's stupid air horn
[25217.97s -> 25224.80s]  Fucking air horn strike out. All right, let's get back to business here
[25233.04s -> 25235.04s]  It's all right, let him waste his meter
[25245.76s -> 25252.60s]  It's all right
[25253.41s -> 25262.21s]  Ah foul ball stay alive. I didn't want to swing. I I wanted to check swing. I tried to check swing
[25262.77s -> 25264.77s]  I tried to check swing and it didn't work
[25274.58s -> 25285.72s]  I hate this. Oh my god. It's part of torspin's impossible to play against he's so good
[25293.76s -> 25295.76s]  All right, come on talk
[25308.95s -> 25312.15s]  You see how insane it is to determine if that's a ball is that a strike or not
[25327.16s -> 25329.16s]  Don't worry. I got this
[25329.24s -> 25338.71s]  Oh my god. Damn it
[25339.20s -> 25344.96s]  Playing against all star back with like difficulty just means they all get like extra stars
[25345.44s -> 25350.00s]  The game's not harder. They just have a fucking 100% more stats than I do
[25363.67s -> 25365.97s]  What happened? No, don't restart the game
[25365.97s -> 25367.97s]  I want to take I gotta take gas out
[25369.36s -> 25371.36s]  Yeah, we're switching gas for e drives
[25374.72s -> 25384.87s]  Oh my god, he sucks, but at least he's fresh
[25385.27s -> 25412.77s]  Now it's one and one that's low and away two and one all right, it's only the fifth inning i'm fine
[25414.61s -> 25416.61s]  I just got to get some contact hits
[25416.93s -> 25420.28s]  It's this fucking character. They have on this team. This guy's in
[25421.40s -> 25425.73s]  This guy's insane. Look at that hot zone
[25426.47s -> 25427.51s]  really
[25427.51s -> 25440.42s]  Swing and a miss strike one
[25441.30s -> 25446.12s]  Outside corner, this is where we get make him greedy. We throw a fastball up and in just out of the zone
[25446.12s -> 25452.28s]  He's gonna freak out. He's just playing that ball exploded. He hit it so hard. Okay. Well new plan
[25465.51s -> 25476.76s]  Two and two swing at it everybody's head and we'll drop in the outfield he's done
[25486.07s -> 25491.51s]  Yeah, okay this guy sucks
[25494.63s -> 25500.79s]  CPU crew it was the bullshit when I threw the ball into the outfield that was when I just went into a total meltdown
[25503.30s -> 25506.90s]  Gas turned around. I went to go pick the guy off and she just threw the ball into the sands
[25507.06s -> 25509.06s]  Like what was that all about?
[25516.50s -> 25525.57s]  It's stepping up player on second two away rent. I don't think rent swings the bat by the way
[25526.55s -> 25535.84s]  I don't think i've seen him swing the bat. I'm screaming. I have homework to do fuck. Okay. He doesn't have a lot of power though
[25536.64s -> 25538.72s]  I kind of uh, what do I should I?
[25545.40s -> 25549.04s]  It's ren. We're fine
[25559.06s -> 25563.62s]  Come on i'm just giving him free meter because they don't swing the goddamn bat
[25578.96s -> 25582.53s]  Okay, I need to get a couple people on base
[25583.78s -> 25587.88s]  I'm not swinging. You gotta pull it that goes across the whole zone
[25593.75s -> 25614.26s]  Take it it's in there. It's not fair. Stop with it
[25616.42s -> 25620.18s]  Stop I feel like i'm watching a donald trump meme video
[25627.65s -> 25632.42s]  That's right down the middle stay at first stay at first
[25638.50s -> 25642.02s]  All right patrick's coming up i'm gonna get a home run right here bang first pitch home run
[25649.99s -> 25670.58s]  I got it back in the game seven to four game ain't over. All right now take him out bench him
[25674.63s -> 25685.01s]  Game's not over. No, it's not not even close breaking ball. I'm not swinging till I get a strike
[25687.78s -> 25690.98s]  That was the okay fine. You want to play that just throw it. I don't care
[25691.86s -> 25694.74s]  action put into these ranking pitches
[25695.78s -> 25705.76s]  Dude burn all your meter. I don't care. You won't have it next inning. It has to throw a strike. Oh my god
[25706.72s -> 25717.73s]  It's in jeff is a mess jeff is a big fat mistake
[25720.61s -> 25723.97s]  I hate that to get that off. I don't want to hear that. I'm gonna keep thinking of those videos
[25734.56s -> 25737.60s]  Oh my god, it was right down the middle. I thought it was going out to the right side of the zone
[25740.96s -> 25742.96s]  Oh my god. All right, it's okay
[25746.53s -> 25754.42s]  Can't wait this little I can't pick another pitcher
[25762.23s -> 25767.24s]  Um, all right, your power is pretty shitty. I'm going curveball down and then he's gonna miss
[25769.72s -> 25771.16s]  Shit, of course
[25771.16s -> 25775.64s]  I got fucking powdered toast man throwing these like monster curveballs that when I do this, I can't hit it
[25778.21s -> 25789.28s]  Uh, that sucks
[25790.08s -> 25806.39s]  I gotta get I gotta get three guys on base and hit grand slam. That's an easy chum chum
[25806.39s -> 25807.59s]  That's an easy play
[25807.59s -> 25815.72s]  You should have picked a better pitcher than who omega lol. No, I should have picked the yak. What was I thinking?
[25816.44s -> 25818.84s]  What was I thinking? I should pick the yak
[25822.05s -> 25827.86s]  I just used my whole meter of what happened was my meters all gone
[25829.78s -> 25836.10s]  What happened wait that uses the whole meter what happened? I'm wait, why is the meter gone? I was saving that
[25838.71s -> 25842.79s]  Turbo uses the actual turbo, but I didn't know that
[25850.28s -> 25852.28s]  I thought that was how to get a dive
[25853.24s -> 25855.24s]  If you hit a home run
[25865.20s -> 25872.02s]  The computer has so much ridiculous stats on all star mode. It's just what the fuck it it is not even possible
[25875.28s -> 25878.26s]  It's not i'm not coming back from this bullshit is impossible
[25891.06s -> 25893.06s]  I'm not quitting. I'm not quitting
[25894.66s -> 25907.96s]  I picked a shit team. I'm doubling down after this i'm picking the the dream team
[25914.40s -> 25935.36s]  From the corner right here
[25935.84s -> 25937.84s]  Oh my god
[25947.11s -> 25952.24s]  All right, can I quit and just take the 500 million? What the fuck dude?
[25953.54s -> 25955.54s]  Why?
[25956.10s -> 25958.10s]  These I can't even
[25962.74s -> 25965.22s]  This is this is absolute blowout now
[25967.14s -> 25970.82s]  Yeah, and why do they hit a home run every fucking single at bat?
[25972.05s -> 25974.29s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[25978.98s -> 25981.28s]  This one is over three on the day
[25987.36s -> 25994.00s]  Oh shit, that's fucking stupid. Oh even ren from ren and goddamn stimpy is gonna hit a home run
[25994.72s -> 25997.92s]  So is he gonna go around the whole thing?
[26015.81s -> 26017.81s]  Hey, there's still plenty of baseball left. Don't worry
[26024.93s -> 26035.88s]  Fuck this is a close game. It's 15 to 4
[26039.97s -> 26043.49s]  What happened why is everybody have to hit home run every at bat
[26044.21s -> 26048.55s]  Is it because this picture I brought this picture and he sucks. What happened?
[26063.32s -> 26066.92s]  Why I it's not over yet I could still come back and win this
[26068.76s -> 26073.80s]  Okay, that's how you get the fucking that's how you get the juices flowing again catch like that. Let's go
[26074.44s -> 26075.64s]  Here it comes
[26075.64s -> 26079.65s]  Don't swing take a strike
[26084.40s -> 26086.48s]  That shit goes 67 miles per hour
[26088.24s -> 26095.75s]  This bitch is just so slow. This bitch is just so slow. You can't it's impossible
[26105.57s -> 26109.49s]  I gotta I gotta pick powder toast man. If i'm gonna double down. I gotta pick powder toast man first
[26110.05s -> 26113.83s]  This guy goes from like 95 to 65
[26119.38s -> 26121.38s]  Still got thrown out. No, he didn't. Okay, i'm good
[26127.14s -> 26130.53s]  Finally, he's out of the game
[26133.09s -> 26142.16s]  I quit i'll take the loss. I lose that's 500 million. I'm literally just calling the team back
[26146.58s -> 26156.39s]  Call the team back slaughter rule games over probably nothing. This is for a billion. I'm going to the boppers
[26160.47s -> 26175.25s]  I gotta get powder toast man off. I'm going i'm going yak
[26177.06s -> 26179.06s]  Yak pitcher don't take powder toast man

[26184.98s -> 26186.82s]  Of this goddamn list
[26186.82s -> 26189.06s]  Bunch box pitching. All right
[26189.76s -> 26200.85s]  Locked in my two favorite players. Toph was good. We're going tough
[26202.88s -> 26203.76s]  No
[26203.76s -> 26205.76s]  No, i've refused to pick. I don't want dandy phantom
[26213.46s -> 26217.04s]  Pick your third basement
[26217.20s -> 26219.09s]  dandy
[26219.09s -> 26227.16s]  Stop getting a wild card in there flying dutchman. Let's go
[26230.39s -> 26235.24s]  Stadium
[26235.24s -> 26237.24s]  I'm going for a total wild card here
[26237.32s -> 26243.48s]  This is for a billion added or a billion off and i'm not i'm done after this. This is the real one
[26244.12s -> 26249.38s]  Let's get this one started. Here's patrick star
[26250.18s -> 26255.54s]  The patrick is here strike one good start
[26263.00s -> 26265.16s]  Really good start now. We slow it down go out of the strike zone
[26270.79s -> 26279.45s]  That's a strike. Let's get back to the game. That's on the corner
[26279.45s -> 26287.64s]  There
[26297.27s -> 26299.11s]  Yak is unbelievable
[26299.11s -> 26313.74s]  Nobody can hit this
[26313.74s -> 26315.59s]  97 miles per hour
[26315.59s -> 26317.59s]  I gotta get a strike out. Let's do slider
[26317.67s -> 26320.31s]  I'm gonna do split fastball down where he likes it
[26320.95s -> 26323.70s]  And entice him to swing in this
[26325.96s -> 26328.20s]  He just got these pure this massive brain
[26330.41s -> 26339.76s]  What the hell is this? I thought that was olive oil for a second from pup eye. I was like, that's not nickelodeon
[26356.97s -> 26361.64s]  Is one and one
[26361.88s -> 26363.00s]  again
[26363.00s -> 26366.12s]  Can't hit the fast stuff. We're going to split it down out of the strike zone swinging a mess
[26368.76s -> 26374.78s]  Oh it injured can they get injured
[26379.40s -> 26385.34s]  All right, you can't you they're gonna get a hit sorry is it this two outs it's fine
[26406.50s -> 26410.02s]  There it is sandy cheeks, what a fucking what happened did I get him? Okay. Yeah, I got him
[26411.16s -> 26414.04s]  That was a beautiful play by sandy that's why you have sandy at third base every time
[26418.36s -> 26423.61s]  Out of toast may lead us off with a nice single
[26424.86s -> 26426.86s]  No, don't go for two. Don't be stupid
[26432.92s -> 26434.92s]  This guy has terrible stats
[26442.42s -> 26445.62s]  Don't throw no double play no double play. Thank god
[26446.42s -> 26456.10s]  Spongebob, it's kind of hard to get the rainbow trail. It's really important. It's kind of hard to see
[26460.39s -> 26462.39s]  Oh my god, it's hard to see his pitch
[26472.46s -> 26475.26s]  Take it
[26475.26s -> 26480.17s]  100 miles per hour way behind
[26481.77s -> 26486.18s]  97 it's in there
[26495.86s -> 26504.04s]  Earth's pitch is a strike. I was spongebob throwing faster than the yak
[26515.64s -> 26521.00s]  Get it in sorry turn double play i'm gonna go with sinking sinking balls down the middle of zone
[26522.52s -> 26527.08s]  It's coming up. All right, we're gonna do split finger. Yeah, turn this double play. This guy sucks
[26527.64s -> 26531.10s]  Not even a nicktoon get out of here
[26531.10s -> 26540.33s]  Not even a nicktoon
[26540.33s -> 26543.37s]  It's that one. There it is. There it is. Nice job tough
[26547.24s -> 26551.72s]  Danny phantom's fast go for two go for second base. Don't try to get a double play
[26552.12s -> 26563.48s]  Can we get a girl out of here? Like how do I just remove girl from the game?
[26568.26s -> 26571.02s]  All right. Now I can play around a little bit here
[26571.02s -> 26573.02s]  Going right down here with a split
[26577.14s -> 26579.14s]  No
[26587.75s -> 26589.75s]  That was so close
[26595.06s -> 26600.25s]  Okay
[26601.80s -> 26610.18s]  I gotta get a strike out
[26610.18s -> 26612.34s]  Not gonna let you fuck with me on that one, buddy
[26613.54s -> 26628.62s]  Split her out of the zone swinging this one. All right. All right, whatever
[26659.96s -> 26682.49s]  What the fuck hold on I wait, oh my god, that was so stupid
[26684.25s -> 26690.06s]  Who's the catcher? Oh my god, that sucks
[26693.48s -> 26700.31s]  What the fuck it's cartoon baseball. Yeah, nobody punched it. Nobody attacked me, buddy
[26703.40s -> 26705.70s]  Okay, I have to uh
[26706.18s -> 26709.13s]  I need to relax
[26709.13s -> 26711.78s]  I gotta relax
[26711.78s -> 26714.65s]  That was so stupid
[26714.73s -> 26725.61s]  That motherfucker is out for the inside corner strike three. Come on don't do it
[26746.06s -> 26747.90s]  Patrick
[26747.90s -> 26767.58s]  That's a strike
[26767.58s -> 26776.98s]  Oh, okay strike two up and in fastball. Perfect throw. Let's go bingo. Oh, all right. It's only one run. I'm fine
[26777.54s -> 26784.50s]  Stepping in for the first time today. I'll swing to get a strike. That's what we did in little league
[26788.60s -> 26790.98s]  Wait a minute
[26790.98s -> 26792.50s]  Did you see that?
[26792.50s -> 26795.78s]  If you throw in their hot zone you get turbo if they if they miss
[26796.58s -> 26801.78s]  Did you see that shit?
[26801.78s -> 26805.29s]  Don't risk it
[26814.68s -> 26820.07s]  All right, that's it just I want to advance the runner flying dutchman
[26820.87s -> 26825.02s]  This is it
[26826.06s -> 26828.22s]  That's right down the middle that's a home no, it's not stay back
[26828.86s -> 26845.50s]  Stepping in don't swing. Oh my god. Oh my goodness
[26847.18s -> 26853.10s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me I swung at the perfect time
[26859.30s -> 26862.58s]  Oh my god, it goes fucking 60 miles per hour
[26865.88s -> 26870.28s]  High game dutchman down. What are you doing?
[26871.48s -> 26876.52s]  Why would you run for third? I didn't tell you to do that. You didn't even slide you fucking ghost imbecile
[26877.74s -> 26882.14s]  What an idiot. I didn't tell him to do that and he didn't even slide. I was smashing a
[26905.53s -> 26918.90s]  I get turbo for that
[26929.46s -> 26937.98s]  It's all right is he even trying it's a one-to-one game on i'm playing in the hardest difficulty. What are you talking about?
[26954.02s -> 26956.65s]  All right, well no, uh, they have some way to turn down play
[26957.61s -> 26959.61s]  Okay, we're gonna go double play time
[26968.60s -> 26970.60s]  Ignoring the runner
[27003.18s -> 27005.74s]  That's a strike it's right in the zone, what are you talking about?
[27012.46s -> 27015.10s]  I cannot let them do that. No way
[27022.28s -> 27023.56s]  Fuck you
[27023.56s -> 27029.19s]  No, he's gonna get meter
[27033.61s -> 27045.42s]  Powder toast man, you suck. How come like spongebob will jump 40 feet in the air and catch that ball
[27048.41s -> 27050.41s]  They dive across the whole game
[27050.57s -> 27056.84s]  He just did a daria. Oh, whoops. Why does he not launch across the whole game?
[27057.96s -> 27059.96s]  Like the spongebob guy does
[27067.46s -> 27069.46s]  Um
[27072.90s -> 27075.94s]  I can't believe it. Why does it have to keep happening?
[27077.93s -> 27087.08s]  It's not fair
[27087.08s -> 27091.56s]  Okay after like the for their third inning they just start hitting every single ball
[27104.31s -> 27118.15s]  It ain't over yet. Don't let it get out of control. Let's get back to the action
[27124.42s -> 27126.84s]  Okay, here we go I need base runners
[27132.94s -> 27136.58s]  I'm not swinging until I get a strike
[27137.22s -> 27139.22s]  That's turbo times three
[27139.22s -> 27145.13s]  Let him walk me in four pitches. Oh my god. I knew what I was doing too. Why would you swing?
[27152.06s -> 27154.06s]  I was about to scream in the microphone
[27158.65s -> 27172.44s]  Come on fill up that meter. I need it. How's that a foul ball? I was just perfect
[27177.05s -> 27181.34s]  Give me something to hit
[27183.58s -> 27190.70s]  The visitors have their work look at that little rinky dink bullshit hit
[27191.50s -> 27198.38s]  That was terrible
[27198.38s -> 27200.38s]  Oh foul ball. Come on
[27205.90s -> 27208.46s]  I gotta string something together. I gotta get people on base
[27228.78s -> 27231.10s]  Four runs is okay. I can deal with four runs
[27232.31s -> 27237.34s]  Should be an easy play and right one two three inning one two three one two three one two three
[27237.82s -> 27244.92s]  I got it. I'm good
[27251.26s -> 27253.26s]  That's a strike give me a break
[27254.22s -> 27256.62s]  I gotta fill up that meter and i'll spring together five hits
[27257.50s -> 27267.40s]  All right, come on
[27269.88s -> 27274.30s]  I thought that was a home run. I was like no way
[27277.48s -> 27282.36s]  Here comes the pitch taken for a ball. You know, the computer is stupid
[27282.68s -> 27304.12s]  Nobody takes that if i'm playing against another person they're swinging. It was scary, but I got it
[27305.24s -> 27307.32s]  I got three meters right now
[27309.43s -> 27311.11s]  down by four runs
[27311.11s -> 27313.19s]  We just don't just let him throw it don't even swing
[27315.06s -> 27318.66s]  But i'm wasted I got almost four of these damn things don't swing
[27319.96s -> 27322.68s]  Second pitch taken for ball two do not swing till I get a strike
[27326.62s -> 27328.62s]  Don't do it
[27328.62s -> 27330.88s]  Don't swing under any circumstance
[27343.29s -> 27347.66s]  All right, I got somebody on base and I have four charges let's go
[27351.43s -> 27354.79s]  Oh my god, if you hit into a double play, I will scream. Thank god
[27357.32s -> 27374.71s]  All right, don't swing till I get a strike that's down the line. All right. All right. All right, dude. Here we go
[27375.75s -> 27378.15s]  I can get to what I can make it a one run game
[27379.24s -> 27381.24s]  flying dutchman
[27383.61s -> 27392.70s]  Or just the one run game five to four. I got this I can do this
[27393.34s -> 27396.22s]  I still got meter too
[27398.15s -> 27409.27s]  Yes, all right. We're back in this i'll swing till I get a strike. I need base runners again
[27411.75s -> 27414.02s]  That's okay
[27414.02s -> 27416.38s]  I'm about to take the lead
[27416.38s -> 27418.38s]  I gotta get it done, right?
[27419.54s -> 27421.54s]  I don't even know who the fuck you are, but you're hitting a home run
[27423.88s -> 27431.56s]  I win six. I just took the lead
[27432.20s -> 27434.20s]  Six four six five. Let's go
[27442.49s -> 27444.49s]  Yeah, sponge bobby
[27444.73s -> 27447.05s]  And powder toast man coming up his contacts the best in the whole game
[27447.85s -> 27454.58s]  Don't swing
[27454.58s -> 27456.58s]  That's gonna be a tricky play no matter who you are
[27457.14s -> 27462.42s]  whatever
[27466.81s -> 27470.81s]  That sounded way more powerful than it was all right, we made some good progress here
[27473.43s -> 27482.17s]  It is don't blow it matters one for two. It's the outside corner
[27484.02s -> 27492.41s]  Stay strong. I'm I am I think I got this I just have to play smart already in the hole strike three
[27511.37s -> 27516.74s]  Sorry
[27527.56s -> 27530.18s]  Stupid air horn
[27536.68s -> 27547.03s]  Zim is there in time and has a base hit get upset computer down. Let's get back. I want to throw the third
[27547.03s -> 27550.95s]  Look, he's halfway down the baseline. I want I want to throw a third base
[27552.41s -> 27554.41s]  What why can't I throw the third base?
[27554.57s -> 27559.08s]  Look at him. I can't throw the third base
[27572.78s -> 27574.78s]  Like where's my I can't throw the race
[27586.95s -> 27588.95s]  Oh god, thank goodness
[27598.07s -> 27600.07s]  Yes double play sit down
[27602.63s -> 27623.11s]  Oh shit
[27623.51s -> 27625.51s]  Are you perfect in a row I have to
[27631.10s -> 27636.14s]  That's good enough for me. All right, this is it. That's what i'm pitching out of a jam. That's what I like to say
[27636.46s -> 27651.54s]  It's not a ball
[27661.02s -> 27668.46s]  Strike him up right here. This is it same place up and in challenge him. That's a strike
[27675.99s -> 27688.12s]  I have i'm going for it. I have to I need to secure the strikeout. That was a strategic place to do that
[27690.25s -> 27692.25s]  He gets a base hit. It's high game
[27692.57s -> 27698.58s]  This hitter is old for two don't say that
[27701.88s -> 27703.88s]  66 mile per hour goddamn changeup
[27710.86s -> 27717.59s]  Let's get back to the action. All right, he's gonna throw two balls in a row. I think good
[27728.44s -> 27731.88s]  Oh they they wha hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, what is
[27732.52s -> 27735.64s]  Excuse me. Who's this random guy that has all
[27736.84s -> 27738.12s]  Everything is maxed
[27738.12s -> 27739.88s]  Who the fuck is this person?
[27739.88s -> 27751.56s]  What let's get back to the game. Whatever
[27752.71s -> 27755.35s]  Are you serious? All right, I just gotta I almost have a meter
[27759.98s -> 27762.94s]  Oh my god the arc on that curve
[27767.64s -> 27771.53s]  mvp right here
[27771.53s -> 27777.42s]  That's a comfortable lead
[27777.42s -> 27783.26s]  Okay, I can't lose. I got they they scored like 15 runs in one inning. I have to be very careful
[27785.66s -> 27795.83s]  Don't get confident
[27801.43s -> 27804.89s]  Don't just hold off
[27804.89s -> 27806.97s]  All right, just let him throw it out and throw it in the dirt. I don't care
[27807.69s -> 27809.94s]  What a waste of turbo
[27809.94s -> 27812.95s]  Must be all-star just take the next pitch
[27813.51s -> 27819.03s]  Whatever. That's all right
[27819.03s -> 27821.03s]  Holy shit, that's so slow
[27821.66s -> 27824.63s]  It's so slow
[27824.63s -> 27826.63s]  flying dutchman
[27833.91s -> 27835.91s]  Wow
[27836.39s -> 27838.07s]  Are you kidding me
[27838.07s -> 27841.03s]  That's huge if I take a couple of balls, I might get another home run
[27847.42s -> 27848.70s]  Give me a meter
[27848.70s -> 27850.70s]  Come on throw another ball out of the dirt
[27853.29s -> 27855.29s]  All right. All right. All right. All right
[27856.39s -> 27859.03s]  Oh, fuck you. That was out of the strike zone. Whatever
[27865.56s -> 27868.46s]  It's I don't get that call
[27876.18s -> 27877.30s]  Okay
[27877.30s -> 27879.70s]  I think I gotta pull out. Uh, I think I gotta pull them
[27880.50s -> 27892.36s]  Oh shit. He actually missed he actually missed
[27907.08s -> 27909.08s]  Get that ball
[27909.40s -> 27912.54s]  That's okay
[27912.54s -> 27916.82s]  We're going home if it's a ground ball
[27917.64s -> 27920.97s]  Keep that in mind
[27920.97s -> 27939.38s]  Ground ball we go home
[27939.38s -> 27944.02s]  Flying dutchman, what in the name of god did you just do that for?
[27944.90s -> 27948.02s]  It was in front of you it's right in front of you
[27960.66s -> 27971.22s]  Oh my god swing that get up
[27975.10s -> 27983.26s]  Okay, we're good everything's fine he's got to come out next inning he cannot pitch in the seventh inning
[27998.87s -> 28000.87s]  There it is. All right, strike him out
[28013.22s -> 28015.22s]  I think I gotta pull him
[28016.10s -> 28019.06s]  I gotta pull him. I think one more batter
[28022.31s -> 28024.31s]  No
[28062.97s -> 28065.05s]  Oh my god, this pitcher sucks
[28065.77s -> 28071.53s]  So much they're gonna hit every single ball. They're gonna hit every single ball
[28072.41s -> 28077.55s]  He's terrible. I don't get six stars in every single category
[28079.42s -> 28083.18s]  I don't how are you supposed to do a nine inning game at nicktoons mlb versus all-star team?
[28083.82s -> 28088.90s]  He doesn't come in with five stars in every category
[28099.10s -> 28101.66s]  Easy play dutchman. Come on. All right, that's it
[28102.86s -> 28105.26s]  I can do this
[28105.26s -> 28108.70s]  I can do this. All right, here we go. He look this pitch is better than sponge bob
[28109.34s -> 28116.23s]  The fuck is this fair?
[28124.38s -> 28128.79s]  You

[28463.77s -> 28465.77s]  And then apparently tagged the guy out at third base
[28471.30s -> 28478.60s]  It hit the runner. No, she caught it. She caught the dumb

[29320.78s -> 29325.02s]  And listen to my voice going like this. How what how could you be so stupid?
[29325.26s -> 29328.46s]  Why can't why can you only switch one pitcher in nine innings?

[30542.78s -> 30544.78s]  Bottom of the third nobody out
[30549.05s -> 30552.82s]  Cooled by the breaking ball one

[30655.46s -> 30657.70s]  10 billion to the debt 10
[30683.61s -> 30685.95s]  If I win everything from tonight is erased
[30750.98s -> 30756.98s]  No
[30775.59s -> 30791.91s]  Hate this game. How do you miss that pitch? I took one fucking perfectly through it. It's impossible to fucking play this
[30798.62s -> 30800.62s]  But waste your meter you fucking idiot
