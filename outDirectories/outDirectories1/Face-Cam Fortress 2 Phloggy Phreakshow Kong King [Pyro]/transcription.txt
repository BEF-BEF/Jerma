[0.31s -> 14.26s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, Saturday's edition,
[14.26s -> 19.58s]  for people on the point right now. We're gonna take care of that right now. Oh, did that
[19.58s -> 26.45s]  hit anybody? Apparently not. Come on, get lit. Playing as the Pyro with the Scorch Shot,
[26.45s -> 32.21s]  as you can see on the screen, the Flowgestinator, Flowgeistinator, however you want to pronounce
[32.21s -> 38.31s]  that freaky weapon, and the Neon Annihilator, trying to get a little interesting setup going
[38.31s -> 43.70s]  here. Whoa, whoa, whoa, lag. What the hell was that? Trying to get an interesting setup.
[43.70s -> 52.65s]  I'll explain it in a second once I have a second here. Oh, come here. Oh, oh, oh, flug.
[52.65s -> 61.42s]  Oh, where are they? Where are they? Where are these rat bastards? Oh, sneak attack, baby.
[61.42s -> 76.26s]  Oh, boy. Maybe not. Oh, crits. Oh, hey, how you doing? Oh, my God, it's chaos. This is
[76.26s -> 89.83s]  absolute chaos. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Dude, dude, this is chaos. I just killed like nine
[89.83s -> 100.76s]  people. Okay, so let me... Oh, heal me, please. Let me try and explain what I was trying to
[100.76s -> 108.41s]  say in the very beginning. Oh, my God. This weapon is such a goofy weapon. I always forget.
[109.35s -> 121.66s]  Come here. Oh, get... Well, that was absolutely insane. Let's do this. So what I wanted to talk
[121.66s -> 128.54s]  about in this video has to do with the scorch shot and the flow-gistinator. Whoa, I just like
[128.54s -> 132.54s]  freaked myself out right there. It has to do with the combination of these two items and how they
[132.54s -> 137.83s]  can be very, very good when used together. Now, that can be said about the detonator as well,
[137.83s -> 142.87s]  but I feel like with the detonator, you do more damage, but you still have to detonate it.
[142.87s -> 148.89s]  And I'm one of those people that I like all the stuff done for me. So it's detonating it by itself
[148.89s -> 152.49s]  when you knock into somebody or when you hit a ground, and plus it knocks people away too.
[153.05s -> 158.73s]  And I was a very, very big advocate of somebody that was against this item when it released,
[158.73s -> 163.21s]  and I'm starting to have second thoughts about it. I think this could really be an interesting
[163.21s -> 169.46s]  item when you use it in the right situations. But we are back here now at their spawn,
[170.54s -> 176.30s]  and let's see if we can't be a real, real bastard here. So you know what? They're all out there. I
[176.30s -> 179.83s]  might as well just go to this. No, I'm not going to, I'm not going to hang out here.
[179.83s -> 184.81s]  Let's go up to where they are. Oh my God. Come to Papa.
[195.30s -> 199.22s]  That's the music I want playing when I have the plug detonator up.
[200.55s -> 202.87s]  When I do the crits, that's the song I want playing.
[203.70s -> 208.58s]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. If only I had custom sounds.
[208.58s -> 213.86s]  All right, get on that point. We're already on it. Oh, they got a sentry.
[214.92s -> 225.18s]  That's not cool. That is not cool, man. Click, click, click, click, click. Boom. Boom. I love
[225.18s -> 230.06s]  the sound this thing makes too. It's so awesome. Also using the neon annihilator. I almost said
[230.06s -> 235.06s]  lionator. I've been watching too much Game of Thrones. He's a lion. He's a Lannister.
[236.82s -> 245.96s]  Oh, that was pretty sweet shot. Just defend the point. Keep the point defended until King Kong
[245.96s -> 252.54s]  and Godzilla come have like an epic battle. Come here. Yeah, you can blast me around all you want.
[252.54s -> 262.95s]  It's still going to be a firefight, bro. Damn. Damn. Not good. Not good. Where are you going,
[262.95s -> 269.11s]  man? Pyro versus Pyro. Come on. That's what it's all about. Damn. I got to get that hit.
[269.11s -> 275.03s]  I got to hit somebody with this. Damn. Come on. I got to get to somebody live with this thing.
[275.03s -> 279.53s]  Oh my God. Why can I not hit anybody? I don't know where the health packs are.
[279.53s -> 285.40s]  Oh, you son of a... I was going to light that guy on fire from behind,
[285.40s -> 291.37s]  activate my crits while he activated his crits. Man, that was going to be crit-ception.
[291.37s -> 301.78s]  It just didn't happen. Damn. It's all right. They're going to win. Just run. Just barrel
[301.78s -> 310.41s]  right through. Oh, this guy had the same idea. I need a medic. I need a medic. Where are you going?
[310.41s -> 319.64s]  What? I thought that was a spy that backstabbed me. I got like launched. Wow. Good show, bro. Good
[319.64s -> 327.75s]  show. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, King Kong. I want to activate my King Kong powers
[327.75s -> 332.39s]  and have them drop from the ceiling. Why am I looking at my actual ceiling? Instead of looking
[332.39s -> 338.33s]  up like this, I looked over at my actual ceiling when I said that. Let me get an overheal. All
[338.33s -> 344.54s]  right. We can't... They can't just take this from us like this. Time to activate the flog rage.
[344.94s -> 358.54s]  Oh, rage. We got it. Damn. I got to hit him. Oh my God. I can't even air blast that either.
[358.54s -> 367.85s]  I got to work on my skill here. Finally. There we go. Knock him around. Now he's going to run.
[367.85s -> 378.81s]  He's going to think I'm going to chase him. I'm not. This is so stupid. Oh my God. I'm going to
[378.81s -> 388.71s]  run out of bullets. Okay. Now I have to... Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Did he just blow himself
[388.71s -> 396.14s]  up? I think he just blew himself up. Oh, crits. Crits everywhere. I'm holding down the button. I
[396.14s -> 403.51s]  don't know where anybody is. Come here. Dude, this is ridiculous. I love this. It's so goofy.
[404.07s -> 412.09s]  Come on. We got to hold him. We got to hold him. This guy won't die. Oh, somebody on it. Somebody
[412.09s -> 421.03s]  on it. Knock him off. This is it. Oh my God. This is going to come down to the wire. Oh, oh,
[422.15s -> 436.30s]  no. Oh, this is bad. Get him off. Oh, good game. Good font game guys. I'll take that loss. That was
[436.30s -> 446.06s]  a close game. Over time, over time. Holy crap. Let's do another one. Nobody, nobody. Engineer on here
[446.06s -> 451.78s]  would be really fun. Whoa. My God. Where did that guy come from? That guy just like launched out of
[451.78s -> 461.90s]  nowhere. Oh, no. This is bad. Oh, this is bad. Get one of them. Get this other guy too. Did you see
[461.90s -> 466.46s]  that medic though? That was crazy. That medic just like appeared right in front of my face.
[466.46s -> 477.16s]  He must've jumped down from the balcony. Respawn. Man, my whole body hurts right now. Every time I
[477.16s -> 483.67s]  move my arms, my whole body hurts because I was at the gym and I went... Oh my God. I'm
[483.67s -> 489.42s]  going to get beat right here. Oh, nice shot. That was like a little pellet shot. But anyways,
[489.42s -> 495.74s]  yeah. Whenever I do this, I got back to the gym. And if you remember old, old, old German channel,
[495.74s -> 498.70s]  I used to go to the gym all the time. I used to go to the gym literally... We were getting spawn
[498.70s -> 504.82s]  camped. Literally every day I would go to the gym and I... That hasn't been happening lately. I've
[504.82s -> 510.57s]  been going to the gym like once every like three months and I really want to change that.
[511.29s -> 516.78s]  So I went back the other day and if you don't go to the gym for a while after going for a long time,
[517.90s -> 525.08s]  every... Why am I not... What was just going on right there? I was holding it on their backs.
[525.08s -> 533.46s]  My ping is 11. What? But anyways, when you go to the gym, if you haven't gone for a long time,
[533.46s -> 540.23s]  your whole body hurts. I did curls and I seriously feel like I want to die right now. Let me get some
[540.23s -> 546.39s]  heals, man. Let me get some of those. Let me get some of those beautiful heals. Whoa. Please heal
[546.39s -> 553.11s]  me. Oh my God. Oh my God, man. Oh my God. I'm stuck right here. I need to get like one hit on
[553.11s -> 562.58s]  somebody. Geez. There it is. There it is. That's what I wanted. Get rid of this. Oh yeah.
[564.38s -> 569.51s]  That was beautiful. That was so lucky, man. I can't believe I did not die from that. Same with
[569.51s -> 580.10s]  that. I should have bled to death right there. No, this is where we go down. Oh, so much stress.
[580.90s -> 590.87s]  Hi. How are you doing? My name is Joma. What's your name? Oh God. Night of Purgatory. Interesting
[590.87s -> 605.86s]  name. Very interesting. Dr. Pepper. Dr. Pepper. Oh, you make the world taste better. Remember
[605.86s -> 614.34s]  that jingle? 30 seconds. We're going to lose. Come on, guys. I have faith. The Flawgistinator
[614.34s -> 624.26s]  has faith. Damn. Oh, he's. No. All right. 50s. I got to change to something else. Boy, before pyros.
[626.26s -> 631.27s]  Soldier. Soldier with whatever. That's fine. I'm just going to like rocket jump over there.
[631.27s -> 639.08s]  Come on. Oh, we're going to get it. Teleporter. Where's it going to take me? Come on. There we go.
[640.28s -> 645.43s]  Get me over there. Oh, that was a bad rocket jump. And so is that. What did I hit the ceiling?
[646.23s -> 663.54s]  Oh, God. Fantastic. Just got it. Oh, get them off. Covet and P. Why am I doing that? I should
[663.54s -> 673.18s]  just shoot. Oh, they have a sentry too. You know, back to pyro. No, stay soldier. I don't know what
[673.18s -> 679.69s]  to do. I'm so scared right now because they only have one second. No, I'm staying soldier.
[679.69s -> 686.34s]  I'm going to stay soldier right now. Level one. Not worth the wait. They have one second.
[689.53s -> 702.65s]  Get me over there. Hey, hello, Mr. Spy. Hello. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wow. He could have
[702.65s -> 711.21s]  just won that. I fell down the stairs. Oh, man. Maybe I should have like not picked up. No,
[711.21s -> 716.73s]  this is bad. Scout. Scout. I'm just like being an idiot with the soldier right now. Let's just
[716.73s -> 724.52s]  regular scatter gun guillotine. I didn't like relax. I'm going crazy. I'm just so scared of that one
[724.52s -> 740.17s]  second. We're okay now. We're okay now. See if I can guillotine some mother effer. Oh, sister lag.
[740.17s -> 761.30s]  Just hit that into a wall apparently. Two scouts, two scouts. Oh, what do we got? What do we got?
[761.30s -> 770.07s]  Oh, you son of a. You son of a. Hey, I'm not really doing a whole lot, but my team is
[770.95s -> 775.27s]  really pulling through right here. Maybe I could even go back to pyro. No,
[775.27s -> 779.00s]  it's going to be five pyros on the team if I do that. We'll stick with this.
[780.58s -> 789.48s]  We'll stick with this for the last 30 seconds. Why not? Let me just scoop somebody up with this.
[789.48s -> 808.81s]  Come on. And nope. Shoot him in his face. Oh my God. So the last like two and a half minutes,
[808.81s -> 814.86s]  I think I've killed one person and I've just been like jumping around like a freak. Hey,
[814.86s -> 822.95s]  whatever works, right? I think that's going to be it. Hey, we did it. Ghost buster. Third place as
[822.95s -> 826.63s]  the scout, except that didn't really happen at all. But yeah, that's going to wrap things up,
[826.63s -> 830.87s]  guys. Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And I'll see you guys all next
[830.87s -> 837.53s]  time. And of course, take care everybody. This is going to grow from here to here. That's a lie.
[837.53s -> 839.61s]  I would never get that up that big.
