[0.06s -> 17.14s]  Fire ants everywhere. I'm going to die from fire ants. Where is the stupid treasure?
[17.14s -> 26.34s]  Wait, wait, wait. What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? Something, something,
[26.34s -> 29.18s]  something, something, something. God damn it.
[29.18s -> 74.96s]  Ah, fucking idiot. Six hours. What is that? Nothing. Well maybe, maybe you shouldn't have
[74.96s -> 84.15s]  lost the map. That would have been really smart. Blew out of my fucking hands. Wild dogs and
[84.15s -> 103.54s]  shit. What's that? I got something, got something. Wait, wait. Hold on. Is it? I always knew.
[103.54s -> 122.82s]  I always knew. Sometimes you just have to double check. What is that? That's the skull.
[122.82s -> 127.78s]  That's the skull. Hey, I found the skull. That's the skull that was on the map. That's
[127.78s -> 145.86s]  all I remember. That's the last thing I remember. Holy shit. Come on. Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
[146.62s -> 170.12s]  whoa. Something in here. Something in there. Something in there. Oh shit. What is this?
[170.12s -> 181.49s]  This goes pretty deep. This goes pretty deep. What on earth is this? What the fuck is that?
[181.49s -> 195.42s]  What the fuck is this? This is huge. What is this? You guys see this? It's a very large
[195.58s -> 206.25s]  rock in here. By the way, have you guys had water in like a couple hours? You have? Alright,
[206.25s -> 222.21s]  we'll share it. There we are. God, this is really in there. Whatever it is. Holy shit.
[222.21s -> 233.54s]  I can't get it out. It's huge. Get out of here. Come on. Whoa. Don't want to lose the
[233.54s -> 250.28s]  hat. I didn't even say hello. How are you? Fucking in here is so bad. I'm going to tire
[250.32s -> 271.54s]  myself out. This is definitely not a treasure. Come on. Get it open. Come on. There it is.
[271.54s -> 290.69s]  Oh shit. I think I broke the shovel. Come on. This was in the ground. This is really,
[291.33s -> 307.18s]  really heavy. That could be from an ancient civilization. Is that it? It can't be. Hold
[307.98s -> 332.73s]  on a second. It's supposed to be cool, but it wasn't. What about over here? Sometimes
[332.73s -> 341.15s]  you need a little bit of intuition. What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that?
[341.15s -> 370.96s]  What's that? What's that? Promise, I'm older than 12. Something else in here. What's that?
[370.96s -> 391.32s]  There's more of this shit. Can you see this? Look it. Mom. Oh, you're not mom. Look at
[391.56s -> 402.53s]  the ground. What the heck are these? There's more. Hold on. There's more in there. There
[402.53s -> 415.03s]  are bees. Okay. All comedy aside, there are bees like swarming. This is how it ends. They're
[415.03s -> 422.66s]  like right in the eyes. Good thing I have glasses on. There's shit in the ground. Wait,
[423.34s -> 447.86s]  hold on a minute. Take these glasses to the front of my face. I could have sworn I got
[449.30s -> 470.70s]  a signal somewhere. Maybe in this vicinity here. I feel like Johnny is opening up. I
[470.70s -> 480.00s]  just got out of the hospital. My surgical gown. This is so tiring. You have no idea.
[483.73s -> 495.40s]  What else is in here? What is this? I don't think this is a rock. Is it a rock? It's probably
[499.74s -> 529.27s]  from the fucking Mayan times. What is it? Holy shoot. More rocks. I don't know if I
[529.27s -> 538.29s]  can do any more with the shovel. This is fucking tiring. That's a huge one. It's too tiring.
[539.29s -> 564.90s]  Give me one second. I'll be right back. I have to get something bigger than that. I got
[573.98s -> 610.36s]  something bigger than a shovel. Get in here. What's up with the big guns? It's in this
[616.26s -> 634.88s]  area here. I'm going to find that goddamn treasure and I'll be the first one. Sometimes
[634.88s -> 653.22s]  all it takes is my nice dig there right up. Why would I have even used the shovel for
[653.26s -> 668.00s]  any reason? Something right in there. Something in there. There's something in there. I don't
[668.00s -> 693.35s]  want to go backwards. Don't go that way. Something in there. Something in there. You see that?
[695.55s -> 708.97s]  That was a shit load of rocks. This place has got all these rocks. Should I do a wheelie?
[708.97s -> 728.63s]  Should I do a wheelie? Let's go. I can't believe. You know how to use that but you don't think
[728.71s -> 733.11s]  I can know everything? You don't think I know how to use one of these? I worked for 10 years
[733.11s -> 770.62s]  in the industry. Give me a break. I think there's something in here. There we go. Get
[770.62s -> 790.99s]  in there. That felt pretty good. That felt pretty good. Felt pretty good. Give me a hand.
[791.15s -> 811.37s]  Only if you're a trained professional like I am. Right here. Right here. There are bees.
[812.37s -> 827.83s]  There are bees and they're very angry. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good. It's like
[827.99s -> 834.99s]  the world's shittiest Disney ride. I paid to rent one of these to just have a personal
[835.51s -> 842.51s]  shitty Disney ride. There's something. I feel something solid. Something solid right on
[853.38s -> 863.68s]  over here. Shit. There's something solid right here. What is over there? I can't go down.
[868.28s -> 880.72s]  There's something in there. Something in there. Hold on. What is here? Oh shit. Red. I almost
[890.97s -> 914.03s]  got solid. Solid. Solid. No. What the? Do you see this? Do you see this? Do you see
[923.36s -> 935.24s]  that? I knew I fucking felt something. Hold on. Holy shit. It's a chest. Oh fuck. Broke
[949.51s -> 956.29s]  it and ripped off. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. You gotta be kidding me. This
[956.29s -> 965.18s]  must be what was on the map. It's gonna be filled with fucking dirt. Oh my god. Oh,
[965.18s -> 974.88s]  don't. There could be valuables in here. Come on. Oh. Wow. What's up? This is the
[1021.29s -> 1027.39s]  trap. One of those things that has stuff in it. This is just a full on actual treasure
[1027.39s -> 1040.36s]  chest. I got rocks. Do we? I or a scientist or something. Some kind of a scientist. You
[1045.39s -> 1053.06s]  can? Get somebody down here. There's a lot. There's some in here too. Give us one second.
[1054.22s -> 1058.34s]  I want to get this stuff ready to go. Can you get a guy? We'll be right back. Let's
[1058.34s -> 1332.98s]  get this stuff ready. I want to see what's in here. Well, well, well, well. Got everything
[1332.98s -> 1338.27s]  situated. Got my glasses off so I can take a look inside and see what's in here. I don't
[1338.27s -> 1344.90s]  know what's gonna be in here, but I'm very curious. Let's find out. It's just like a
[1344.90s -> 1351.90s]  Legend of Zelda. It should be like. Oh my god. There's a lot of shit in here. What is
[1359.07s -> 1371.59s]  in here? Okay, there's a letter. This looks like a letter. What does it say? Yeah, buddy.
[1375.89s -> 1382.37s]  You're a loving family. If you're reading this right now, I'm probably dead. Or you
[1382.37s -> 1387.37s]  stole it from me, in which case I want it back. But give it back if you took it, but
[1387.37s -> 1392.69s]  if I'm dead then you can keep it. But anyways, if you find this letter, you found my treasure
[1392.69s -> 1398.69s]  chest, you found all of my goodies that I've been keeping for the last 30 to 40 years.
[1398.69s -> 1405.05s]  There's some valuable stuff in here, and whoever found this, congratulations, you just went
[1405.21s -> 1411.21s]  up a whole tank of records. Absolutely no love to any of you. It's in my truest heart
[1411.21s -> 1416.21s]  of hearts that I really hope that at least some of you die trying to get this. I mean,
[1416.21s -> 1421.21s]  killing each other. I really hope that 10 of you fucking got here and had chainsaw and
[1421.21s -> 1426.21s]  firearms and are killing each other over this. And if I had to make any bets at all, it would
[1426.21s -> 1431.21s]  be Danny. I bet you Danny's the one holding this treasure chest right now. And if I'm
[1431.37s -> 1437.81s]  dead, who cares, I'm dead. So all in all, have a wonderful rest of your life with your new
[1437.81s -> 1451.40s]  found fortune, Grandpa. What a fucking maniac. Well, it wasn't Danny. What happened to him?
[1459.99s -> 1467.55s]  Anyways, interesting, Grandpa. I guess, thank you, we found it. Now what's in here though?
[1467.55s -> 1474.79s]  I saw some, I got a good look, let's see. Looks like we have various snack items. Dunkaroos.
[1476.99s -> 1493.13s]  There's like a time capsule. Capri Suns Kinder Joys. 3D Doritos. Oh, Gushers. Grandpa, I mean,
[1494.69s -> 1497.69s]  this would have been in the 90s, maybe this would have been alright, this would have been
[1497.69s -> 1502.29s]  cool, maybe you thought. But a bunch of people complained on Twitter, and all this shit came
[1502.29s -> 1511.69s]  back. Like, I think this is, can't you just buy this? Can't you buy Surge? And why would
[1512.09s -> 1519.98s]  you put this many Capri Suns in here? Like, did you just have too many? This is fucking
[1519.98s -> 1534.70s]  horrible. What is even in here? What is this? This is a Tamagotchi. Is it alive? Is this
[1535.10s -> 1547.14s]  alive? Can you see? Is it alive? I think it's still alive. Should I feed him? What do you
[1547.14s -> 1556.52s]  think? Oh, there's shit everywhere. He's covering his own shit. How do I feed him? I haven't
[1556.52s -> 1568.90s]  used one of these in a long time. 1.18 p.m. 1952? Didn't these come out in like 1996?
[1569.30s -> 1582.12s]  What are, whatever. I don't know what these are, but whatever. Wait a minute. Wait, wait,
[1582.12s -> 1585.12s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[1585.12s -> 1593.29s]  wait, wait, wait. My God. Grandpa, you did it. All the stupid 90s snacks, nobody gives
[1593.29s -> 1597.29s]  a shit about those. You can get those at the grocery store right now. Collectible Monster
[1597.29s -> 1605.17s]  card packs from 1997. If this is Pokemon. Oh, now I understand what he was doing. Oh,
[1605.57s -> 1613.06s]  my, get all the 3D Doritos. They came back and they don't even taste the same. All this
[1613.06s -> 1621.27s]  shit doesn't even taste the same. I have heard that Pokemon cards go for a shitload of money.
[1621.27s -> 1627.47s]  I've seen people open, if that's what's in there, that has to be what's in there. 1997.
[1627.47s -> 1633.14s]  That's a booster pack in there. Oh, my God. Why don't you come over and get a look at
[1633.14s -> 1638.14s]  this? Are you ready for the great fucking reveal? Collectible Monster card packs, holy
[1638.34s -> 1648.94s]  shit. Pokemon cards. What is this? What is Grotto Beasts? What is Grotto Beasts? Oh,
[1656.85s -> 1666.84s]  my fucking God. You picked? This shit didn't even go for like one full season on TV. In
[1667.32s -> 1674.74s]  fact, I think this company is liquidated. 1997. Yeah, they're jumping on the bandwagon
[1674.74s -> 1682.05s]  of Pokemon. Booster pack opening. Let's see what's in here because of Grotto Beasts. No
[1686.99s -> 1696.22s]  Charizard in here? Well, let's see what's in. Let's see what we got. Holy shit. Actually,
[1697.06s -> 1706.14s]  this is pretty good packaging. Wow. That's what's in here? Pretty cool. All right. Well,

[1735.92s -> 1744.92s]  matter? Does this matter at all? Weenie Mutt. Should I be touching these? Should I not be
[1744.96s -> 1753.21s]  touching these? A Veggie Roo. Oh, that's actually kind of cool looking. These are actually fucking
[1753.21s -> 1759.66s]  cool. These are really cool. Razzle Puss. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait,
[1759.66s -> 1767.23s]  wait a minute. Look at this one. Look at this one. This one, this is, cut to my face. Quick,
[1767.23s -> 1776.18s]  quick, quick, quick, cut to my face. A Foil Razzle Puss. Oh my God. It's a Foil Razzle
[1776.66s -> 1787.36s]  Puss. Do you see that? Oh, this has got to be worth, that has to be, yeah. But it's not
[1787.36s -> 1796.49s]  worth, is it? What, we got Sir Grieves. Should I put that in something? These are fucking
[1797.97s -> 1807.42s]  cool. A Biogator. Eight Attack. Holy crap. That's, oh wait, sweet, whoa, whoa, this Sweet
[1807.98s -> 1815.41s]  Tooth has got a two. Look it. That's a, that's a Foil Sweet Tooth. Oh shit. No, it's flying
[1816.41s -> 1821.41s]  off the table. These aren't worth money. These might be worth money. That's going to get
[1821.41s -> 1835.03s]  lost in the fucking. Wait, where'd it go? You think I'm going to lose the Razzle Puss
[1840.83s -> 1850.17s]  that you're out of your mind? That's what the bag is for? Oh. Hold on, what else we
[1850.17s -> 1858.86s]  got? This, these are pretty actually kind of cool. Grotto Beasts. Who would have thought
[1859.26s -> 1874.46s]  that? I'm going to be more careful, hold on. Excellent packaging, I love this. Whoa. Oh

[1898.70s -> 1903.68s]  bunch of people just said, don't touch him. It's fine, it's all right. It's just fucking
[1903.68s -> 1908.57s]  Grotto Beasts. What do you care? Peep, I like Peep Peep. Peep Peep's really cool.
[1908.57s -> 1916.95s]  What's the damage? Heals all allies one HP at the beginning of each turn. Is that good?
[1916.95s -> 1922.88s]  An Ante-Bite. Swipe attack up to three, is this, this is actually pretty, this is kind
[1922.88s -> 1931.26s]  of cool. Oh god damn it. That, whoa whoa whoa, foil, foil, foil, foil alert, foil alert.
[1931.26s -> 1940.64s]  That's a foil bag ghost. You gotta be kidding me. Wow, this is really cool. Hey, um, this
[1949.53s -> 1954.78s]  company, this company doesn't exist anymore, right? You can look into it. I remember there
[1954.78s -> 1960.70s]  was one season on TV show, right? Something like that. Could you find out how much this
[1960.70s -> 1966.29s]  company's worth? If it even, if it even is still like for sale or anything. You get back
[1966.33s -> 1975.02s]  to me with the price, I'm curious. Dust Bunny? You see Dust Bunny? There you are. I love Dust
[1976.18s -> 1985.33s]  Bunny. Okay, okay, okay, all right, all right. This is a holographic sludge. I don't, okay,
[1988.34s -> 1993.21s]  I don't, should I not, don't touch it, just leave it here. I'm not gonna touch that. That
[1993.21s -> 1997.42s]  is my favorite character already. I don't even know what it is, but I love it. That's
[1997.42s -> 2002.90s]  a holographic foil sludge. Can you, can you get me something where I can actually put
[2002.90s -> 2008.20s]  this down on? Yeah, sure. Give me like a, give me the thing that they put them in. Like
[2008.20s -> 2013.50s]  a napkin. Do you have any napkins? I shouldn't be touching this like this. I should have
[2013.50s -> 2020.82s]  my gloves on. A napkin. Like a white napkin? A napkin, any napkin, any, hurry the fuck
[2020.82s -> 2032.91s]  up. God damn it. I gotta, I gotta seal it, man. I, I, you can't, I don't want to touch
[2032.91s -> 2038.84s]  it like that because then it's protected. I don't, it might be worth them. I don't know.
[2038.84s -> 2049.30s]  Who knows? I'm gonna put this back in the worthless chest of nothing. Shit. These are
[2049.30s -> 2055.18s]  like going in the dirt. People are probably having a panic attack right now. They're going
[2055.18s -> 2062.42s]  in the sand. I keep forgetting to put them down. Did I lose the holographic sludge? Did
[2062.42s -> 2070.72s]  I lose the holographic sludge? I don't see it here. Is it in the box? No. Where'd it
[2071.16s -> 2083.04s]  go? It actually blew away. I have to, I have to find that. It's not in my hand, right?
[2083.04s -> 2088.80s]  No. Somebody actually go look for that. Like I'm serious. Yeah, okay. Because I like actually
[2088.80s -> 2091.76s]  want that one. Like that's not like a part of like this joke or anything. I like want
[2091.76s -> 2117.51s]  that card. What do I look for? Is it, is it not even here? Did it go over, alright, well,
[2117.51s -> 2128.83s]  well that's okay. Well let's open another couple, let's open some more of them. We got
[2128.83s -> 2141.38s]  another pack of Grotto Beasts. I've seen people do this. This is big, big content. You got
[2143.08s -> 2153.31s]  it? It's not, this is, it's literally, oh it's, it's ours Charlie. It's ours Charlie.
[2153.91s -> 2167.86s]  I got a golden, knock this shit over. I, no wait, I put it in here. I put it in the box.
[2169.75s -> 2180.94s]  I put it in the box. I put it in the box. What are you guys saying? Zilly Wonka? It's
[2180.98s -> 2196.81s]  in the chest. It's in the chest. You're a dumbass. Whatever. We're going to keep going.
[2196.81s -> 2212.78s]  Put this in here. Put it over here. Here we are. You all, that's already a festive mimic
[2214.10s -> 2221.10s]  with a gold foil on it and I don't even know what that means. Oh my god. They keep, no!
[2221.10s -> 2229.48s]  Am I going to have to get a drill out here and start like pinning this stuff down? No,
[2230.08s -> 2242.83s]  don't ever open up the card packs on a windy day. This is what you all wanted to see. This
[2242.83s -> 2250.42s]  is what you wanted to see. This is what you wanted. Festive mimic. I'm going to hold onto
[2250.42s -> 2257.13s]  that one. Here's the thing about doing this. What else can I possibly say about what I'm
[2257.13s -> 2263.33s]  doing right now? You know what I mean? What else can I even possibly say? We found a company.
[2264.05s -> 2271.05s]  We can buy it. How much is it worth? Like $350,000. It's $350,000 for the... It's GrottoBeast.com
[2272.05s -> 2279.05s]  is what we found. GrottoBeast.net? .com. GrottoBeast.com. How much is it? $350,000. For the whole
[2281.53s -> 2288.74s]  IP. All of it. That's all the assets. Everything. Yeah, buy it. Buy it. Buy it right now. You
[2288.74s -> 2294.65s]  got access to my checking account. Get it. Yeah, buy it. Yeah, no, this is cool. This
[2294.65s -> 2307.36s]  is cool. I'll own it. Blademos. Holy shit. That's a lizard wizard? This one's got really
[2307.64s -> 2315.38s]  good speed. All right, let's do this the right way. Oh, wow. Toadstool. Wow. Birthday basher.
[2317.86s -> 2324.02s]  Wow. Optimal. This one's pretty cool. Look at this one. Optimal illusion. What's he got?
[2324.02s -> 2329.34s]  1-2-0-0 illusions with taunt. Grand finale. After reaching below 2HP, Optimal illusion
[2329.34s -> 2336.11s]  puts on a grand display, stunning all enemies for one round. I like this. This is fucking
[2336.11s -> 2343.79s]  cool. Did you get it? Did you buy it? You got it. It was that easy? Well, I mean, I
[2343.79s -> 2347.19s]  left a voicemail. All right, buy it. You're probably the only person that left a voicemail
[2347.19s -> 2350.47s]  at that company's voicemail in the last like 25 years, so that's fine. At least the number
[2350.47s -> 2356.82s]  was still connected. That's cool. All right, good. You say GrottoBeast.com? Yeah. All
[2357.50s -> 2368.55s]  right. Baroot. Baroot's cool. Jukeboxer. Oh, this is the... I love Jukeboxer. This is awesome.
[2374.00s -> 2380.99s]  And look at this one. Look, I love the festive mimic. That's unbelievable. How many more
[2380.99s -> 2389.10s]  packs do I have? Oh, dude, this is the rest of the damn stream. I don't care. And we got
[2389.10s -> 2395.50s]  a shitload. Hey, did you get ahold of a scientist? You got somebody, right? Okay. Because we
[2395.50s -> 2400.78s]  have... This rocks that I've never seen before. So I definitely don't want to see what the
[2400.78s -> 2417.83s]  deal is with those. This is now a card pack opening stream. Let's see what we got here.
[2417.83s -> 2425.42s]  Ooh, that's a bobbin. This is a common bobbin. That's a general festive mimic. I'm starting
[2425.42s -> 2430.40s]  to understand their names. That's a general porcelain. We saw that already. We saw that
[2430.40s -> 2439.98s]  with these. These are some repeats. Toy Rex. We're waiting for the foil. Toy Rex? Sneezy.
[2440.86s -> 2450.27s]  Sneezy sneezes. There's a booger on that one. There's a piece of food on that one. Oh! A
[2461.16s -> 2469.49s]  chroma nova! Oh, what the... No! No! No! No! No! Relax. What's it got for attack? Well,
[2469.49s -> 2481.19s]  this... Well, actually, holy shit. 877... 8779? Magic? This is the strongest card we've found
[2491.91s -> 2497.50s]  so far, and it's gold foil. All right, put that one in the clock. Because that one's
[2497.50s -> 2503.81s]  probably worth something. That's probably worth something, right? We got a common meowedy?
[2505.70s -> 2514.02s]  Oh, there's more. There's more. A storm flatty? Wow! Wow! Lick my... I'm gonna... And then
[2518.50s -> 2526.57s]  I'm gonna touch it, and I'm gonna touch my hand. I just heard eww. Somebody said eww.
[2529.50s -> 2540.45s]  That was pretty disgusting. All right, I think we got through these. All right, we got three
[2540.49s -> 2561.71s]  more packs of Grotto Beasts. Three more. Don't get too excited. So, I can't... Let me see
[2563.03s -> 2577.36s]  the chat for a sec. What does it say? He looks like he has a sunburn. Do I? Do I have a sunburn?
[2578.74s -> 2586.97s]  A little? What happened to his big stomach? He better not say anything fucked up. I got
[2586.97s -> 2599.58s]  a blaster. It's beautiful out here. Yeah, come on. We're just having a relaxing day when
[2599.62s -> 2610.29s]  we open up card packs. Oh, we got another Sneezy. That's another Sneezy. And another
[2610.29s -> 2626.70s]  bag ghost. Razzlepuss? That's a bee. Don't move. Get away from me. Is he gone? Ah, shoot!
[2629.16s -> 2639.34s]  No, I'm just kidding. Oh, a Razzlepuss. That's a holographic peep peep. We're gonna have
[2639.34s -> 2644.70s]  to really run around and collect all these things. Invasive Waves Strider. Holy shit,
[2644.70s -> 2655.32s]  that's awesome. Puddle Puppy. Another Biogator. A Weenie Mutt. Another Dust Bunny. A Toadstool.
[2658.29s -> 2671.70s]  That pack was alright. That pack was alright. Did somebody say next game? Yeah, let me
[2680.48s -> 2689.32s]  load up Yakuza. In the middle of the damn desert, man. What are you talking about? Next game.
[2689.72s -> 2699.06s]  I'm like, I'm... let me go to my computer. Oh, Yakuza Pog. He said Yakuza. Do you want
[2699.20s -> 2713.84s]  to say what? Do you want to say what? Hey, do you want to say what? GrotterBeast.com.
[2713.84s -> 2726.92s]  Do you want to say what? Ooh, ooh, let's see the pack. Oh shit, Glow Angel. Night Mite.
[2727.12s -> 2735.88s]  I'm waiting for a Gold Foil. Hi, Liar. Very cool. Zapbit. Here we go, here we go. This
[2735.88s -> 2746.42s]  is a holographic Zapbit. That looks so cool. I love this. Hylin Destroyer. Hypno Days.
[2748.69s -> 2756.19s]  Put an enemy to sleep for three rounds. That sounds pretty fucking awesome. XBlosion. That's
[2756.19s -> 2764.78s]  awesome. XBlosion. And then a... ooh. Hold on. That was... well, this is cool. How do
[2764.78s -> 2772.53s]  people do this? I'm asking honestly. I have to ask very honest questions. Do people open
[2776.39s -> 2786.95s]  like a hundred of these? I ran out of stuff to say like 15 minutes ago. All right, let's
[2786.95s -> 2795.66s]  go back. Glow Angel. Night Mite. Hi, Liar. I like the Zapbit though. Look at that shit.
[2796.74s -> 2802.98s]  Look at how awesome that is. Now that is a quality card. And I will be putting my fingerprints
[2803.10s -> 2818.14s]  all over it. Any more? We got two more packs and that's it. I just realized what I was
[2818.14s -> 2828.94s]  doing with my mouth. This is awesome. Grotto Beasts. And now I own this. I own it. It's
[2829.94s -> 2838.56s]  mine. I can do whatever I want with this now. Hmm. I wonder what that means. I wonder what
[2839.34s -> 2853.78s]  he's talking about. Let's get that open. What was it? Oh, we... People want to invest. You
[2853.94s -> 2866.78s]  want to invest? I have a chat over here. I have to walk. I would die for Proto Jammer.
[2866.82s -> 2881.60s]  Grotto Beasts Tournament incoming. God damn. We're going to clean all this up. They're
[2881.60s -> 2886.74s]  not going far. They're just going like right here. We've got to get the cleanup crew out
[2886.74s -> 2906.04s]  here after this. Ow. A slug. I feel like I'm like torturing people. Birthday Basher. Hi
[2906.04s -> 2913.34s]  Liar. Meowdy. These are all... I think we've got to repeat. Don't be seeing these around.
[2914.14s -> 2920.12s]  This is cool though. Veggie Roo. Peep Peep. Sludge. Holographic Optimal Illusion though.
[2920.12s -> 2942.18s]  That's really valuable. That's worth something. Last one. Damn it. There's one more here.
[2957.53s -> 2972.05s]  Dumpy. Stop littering. I'm going and picking it up. That's all that's over there. You don't
[2972.05s -> 2977.01s]  see over here. I'm putting all the... They're all going in here. Don't worry. I'm a litterer.
[2977.01s -> 2989.16s]  Fuck that. I ain't got a litter. Don't do that shit. Pick up after yourself. Oh, Crab
[2989.16s -> 3001.04s]  Jaw. This is the last pack. Dragosum. An Antibite. Oh, Proto Jammer. Somebody said that they
[3001.12s -> 3008.28s]  would die for this guy. I don't know who you are, but it's pretty cool. It's a really cool
[3008.28s -> 3021.57s]  card. Holographic Storm Platy. A Dragosum. A Toy Rex. And a Holographic Sir Grieves.
[3023.85s -> 3036.62s]  Excellent. All right. Coming up next. That's all of the card packs. Thank you, Grandpa,
[3037.18s -> 3041.46s]  for your worthless chest. But still, that was kind of a cool... That's a cool thing.
[3041.46s -> 3048.46s]  I don't own that company. There's other... I don't know. Whatever. We got a bunch of
[3049.70s -> 3056.70s]  rock. Did you see these? Look up here. These came out of the ground. I really... Do we
[3056.70s -> 3061.22s]  have... Do we have any ETA on the scientists? Yeah, just like two or three minutes. A few
[3061.22s -> 3068.85s]  minutes? There could be stuff inside of these. I have no idea. Why don't we break them open?
[3068.85s -> 3075.48s]  Sound like a good idea? You want to crush them? Yeah. All right. Let's get that set up. Let's
[3075.52s -> 3084.31s]  crush a bunch of geodes. Get a scientist. We'll be right back. After this short... Just
[3084.31s -> 3406.57s]  cut it before I look like an idiot. So, hello there. Welcome back. As you see, we have our
[3406.57s -> 3412.01s]  beautiful geodes on the table. And I'm joined by Josh from ScienceCenterNevada.org. Josh,
[3412.01s -> 3417.41s]  good to see you. Pleasure. By the way, I want to make this really clear. Not an actor. That
[3417.41s -> 3423.45s]  this is not like an actor. This is a scientist. This is a real scientist from ScienceCenterNevada.org.
[3423.45s -> 3427.33s]  So, first and important, very important. I want to make this really clear. Everybody
[3427.33s -> 3432.21s]  on site here has been tested for COVID within the last 24 hours. All negative. Very important.
[3432.21s -> 3436.07s]  That's why we're still trying to be a little socially distant and everything. But everyone
[3436.07s -> 3441.81s]  on site here has been tested for COVID negative in the last 24 hours. Very important. So,
[3441.81s -> 3448.05s]  I guess as a archaeologist, you could probably give us... Well, wait, wait, wait. This isn't
[3448.05s -> 3453.73s]  archaeology. It's not? No, we're dealing with rocks. Oh, okay. Archaeology people stuff.
[3453.73s -> 3461.28s]  Rock stuff, that's geology. So, this is not archaeology? Not at all. The title of the
[3461.28s -> 3468.50s]  stream is The Wonders of Archaeology and we have t-shirts that are being printed that
[3468.50s -> 3475.90s]  are archaeology t-shirts. You might have to cancel those and thanks a lot for that. Not
[3475.90s -> 3480.54s]  archaeology. All right. That's a common misconception, right? Yeah, I would say so. So, we're going
[3480.54s -> 3487.55s]  to break these open. Welcome to the stream. I hope you enjoyed the intros. So, each one
[3487.55s -> 3493.15s]  of these hopefully has something interesting in the middle. Let's find out. And over here,
[3493.15s -> 3497.63s]  we got one here, over here. Let's get our safety protection eye gear. Over here we have
[3497.63s -> 3508.71s]  a device. Now, this device is designed to open these. I think its original purpose is
[3508.71s -> 3514.31s]  to cut pipes. I think so, yeah. Oh, an understanding. So, how this works, we're going to be very
[3514.31s -> 3521.24s]  careful. We've been trained, sort of, in how to use it. So, we're going to try to open
[3521.24s -> 3525.44s]  as much of these as we can and see what we get. Eye protection gear, safety is number
[3525.44s -> 3531.52s]  one important. Let's get it open and see if we can get one to work. We have tested it
[3531.52s -> 3538.50s]  and we got it to work, but let's, live TV, right? Let's see what we can get. So, the
[3538.50s -> 3545.50s]  idea is you put the rock right in the middle and you wrap the chain around so it's taught
[3545.50s -> 3549.34s]  right down the middle. It looks like it's down the middle, right? Yep. And if we can
[3549.34s -> 3561.18s]  go like this, get it in there like that. So now, let's see if we can get this to break.
[3561.18s -> 3569.82s]  Are we ready to try our first rock? Are we good? Let's see what happens. Here we go.
[3569.82s -> 3579.96s]  It's time to break the first rock. Did I got it? Let me check it. I think we got it. We
[3580.96s -> 3588.78s]  got it. Oh, my God. That looks awesome. So, what is going on in here? So, what we have
[3588.78s -> 3595.30s]  here is a geode. And so, if you get up close there, in the space and inside the hollow,
[3595.30s -> 3599.18s]  those are quartz crystals. And so, each of these are individual quartz crystals growing
[3599.18s -> 3602.90s]  in there. Oh, my God. Can I see one of the half of these? I want to get this onto the
[3602.90s -> 3611.74s]  other camera. So, this is quartz. Quartz, yes. Can we see under here? Under this little
[3611.74s -> 3618.74s]  guy here? So, this isn't as hollow as some of them. Is there a reason why they're not
[3618.74s -> 3624.14s]  as hollow? Each one of them forms as an air bubble in a lava flow. And so, depending on
[3624.14s -> 3627.74s]  how much time there's been for water to pass through these voids, the minerals get bigger
[3627.74s -> 3633.96s]  and bigger and fill in the hole. Oh, all right. This one looks like it's a bit of a tapping.
[3633.96s -> 3638.32s]  And I know, I've seen the comments that I'm just like a little terrible version of him.
[3638.32s -> 3649.01s]  Look at me. This is the real deal here, okay? So, it worked. It worked. We were terrified
[3649.01s -> 3653.61s]  that it wasn't going to work. So, which one should we do next? What do you think? Let's
[3653.61s -> 3661.31s]  pick a random one. Just pick a random one? All right. Let's go for it. Let's do it again.
[3661.31s -> 3666.57s]  Let's get the chain up. We need to lift her up. So, this one's a little bigger. Let's
[3666.57s -> 3675.41s]  see how this one is. Like right there, maybe? Yeah, here we go. Get it right in the middle.
[3676.21s -> 3683.68s]  All right. That looks good. All right. You ready? This one's a little bigger. Here we go.
[3688.53s -> 3702.06s]  This one's done. Come on. Got it. Oh, that's awesome. Oh, whoa. Holy. So, those are really
[3702.06s -> 3705.98s]  clear quartz crystals, which tells us that that's a really pure mineral. So, that's why
[3705.98s -> 3710.54s]  you're getting kind of that glassy appearance of them. That looks incredible. Let's carefully
[3710.54s -> 3716.48s]  get this out of here. Oh, wow. That looks like the inside of a cave. This looks like a cave.
[3716.48s -> 3725.30s]  It's kind of like a mini cave, yeah. You're going to here? That one looks really,
[3725.30s -> 3727.94s]  didn't you see that one? This one looks awesome. There's like caverns in this one.
[3729.60s -> 3737.12s]  You get a good view? Look at those crystals. I have no idea what's going to happen with one
[3737.12s -> 3741.78s]  of these huge ones. This is really pretty. It's awesome. Quartz is actually one of the most common
[3741.78s -> 3746.74s]  minerals on the planet. So, these are some really pretty examples of them. All right. Let's grab
[3746.74s -> 3754.02s]  this guy here. This one. Something's rattling around him. Can you hear that? Can you pick that
[3754.02s -> 3765.38s]  up? Okay. What is in here? There's only one way to find out. That's right. Want to give me a hand
[3765.38s -> 3774.03s]  and hold this up for me? Thank you. There's something shaking around in here. What if there's
[3774.11s -> 3787.60s]  a bunch of snakes just came up? Maybe one more? Right there. Almost got it. Let's see if that
[3787.60s -> 3795.31s]  does it. It's right in the middle, right? Looks good. All right. You ready to go? Here we go.
[3797.79s -> 3812.91s]  Three, two, one. Get it. What? That's a good bowl. Cool. Oh, my God. So, why is this one like that?
[3812.91s -> 3817.79s]  So, the small minerals are in there because this one just hasn't had as much exposure to groundwater
[3817.79s -> 3822.51s]  to build the big minerals. And another interesting thing about this one is that this isn't just pure
[3822.51s -> 3827.39s]  quartz this time. I don't know how easy it is to see where you're at, but they're actually kind
[3827.39s -> 3832.19s]  of purplish. Yeah. And so, this is a variety of quartz called amethyst. Oh, this is amethyst. All
[3832.19s -> 3837.95s]  right. Cool. That's awesome. So, quartz is amethyst? Yep. Amethyst is a variety of quartz. It has a
[3837.95s -> 3842.11s]  little bit of iron in it. You just learned something right here. Let's get a good look.
[3847.04s -> 3852.00s]  This looks like almost like an ashtray. That's what it looks like. Like somebody just like
[3852.00s -> 3856.86s]  flicking cigarettes in here. That one was, this one's awesome. I love this one. Cool. Yeah.
[3857.98s -> 3863.10s]  All right. Should we do, let's do a couple. I'm trying to hold. This is like the ultimate stalling.
[3863.10s -> 3867.66s]  Wait, what are these over here? What are those? What do you mean? If you take a look at these
[3867.66s -> 3873.50s]  over here. No, what is it? You can just have it. I don't, I don't care. I don't know what it is.
[3873.50s -> 3880.46s]  All right. I don't know what it is. You can just have it. Let's do this one. Yeah. Is this some
[3880.46s -> 3887.52s]  rocks you can just take? I don't care. Thank you. Yeah. No problem. Let's get this one. This one
[3887.52s -> 3892.86s]  has like outside colors. Is there a reason why this one has like, like purple? Because these
[3892.86s -> 3898.54s]  are lava flows. There's probably a microscopic mineral in there called orthoclase. Orthoclase.
[3899.50s -> 3909.02s]  Sounds like a prescription drug. You're talking comedy and education. Let's get it in there.
[3909.02s -> 3910.70s]  This is what happens when you bring scientists on set.
[3912.14s -> 3916.00s]  No, this is awesome. You didn't think you were going to learn anything today.
[3916.56s -> 3919.84s]  It's a weekend. They think you're going to learn anything on the weekend. You want,
[3919.84s -> 3924.64s]  you, would you want to do the honors? Okay. All right, cool. All right, here we go. Ready?
[3926.86s -> 3934.45s]  Maybe one more. One more rung. It's not getting the tautness up here.
[3936.64s -> 3948.22s]  There. So maybe stick it in here. There we go. That should do it. Get in there. Get in there.
[3950.62s -> 3959.79s]  Get it. You get it. It's an awkward shape. All right, here we go. Ready? Let's see what's in the
[3959.79s -> 3972.51s]  purple lava rock. There it is. Carefully lift it out. Did it get it? Yep. What's that? Oh, wow.
[3973.47s -> 3981.41s]  So this one's like, this is black in there? Yeah, so that's a lot of the original lava rock.
[3981.41s -> 3984.61s]  So there's a couple different types of lavas in here. There's the pink stuff, which is called
[3984.61s -> 3989.01s]  rhyolite, and then there's the blackish stuff, which is more just a typical lava rock you'd
[3989.01s -> 3993.81s]  have in a barbecue or something. Then instead of quartz, this time we have, it looks like calcite
[3993.81s -> 4001.34s]  blades. Yeah, these are like flakes. Looks like salt flakes. Hey, Chad, do you guys want to get
[4001.42s -> 4009.39s]  a closer look? Do you guys want to get a closer look? I can barely even see that. Yeah, it looks
[4009.39s -> 4015.57s]  like salt. Like salt flakes. This is so cool. So it's a different type of water that's going
[4015.57s -> 4019.09s]  through this one versus the ones that we already opened up. Oh, okay. So when you mean different
[4019.09s -> 4023.09s]  types of water, do you mean like with different minerals in the water? Exactly. So different
[4023.09s -> 4030.27s]  dissolved minerals as the water's coming through. That's so cool. Science. Support your local
[4030.27s -> 4036.82s]  science projects and your local science organizations. Come on, look at this. How about
[4037.70s -> 4045.70s]  let's do, how about this? We'll do another big one. This one is meaty and this one's heavy too,
[4045.70s -> 4050.18s]  and you mentioned that the heavier the rock, it's kind of the more that could be inside of it,
[4050.18s -> 4056.37s]  right? More minerals that have grown in it, yeah. I'm like so excited. There's still so many to do
[4056.69s -> 4072.48s]  I love this. Let's go right down the middle here. Get it on there. That looks pretty good.
[4073.84s -> 4084.22s]  All right, you ready? Three, two, one. Oh, this one's tough.
[4086.38s -> 4094.82s]  There you go. All right. So this one is pretty pure quartz, but it does have a little purplish
[4094.82s -> 4099.94s]  tint to it. Yeah, this one. Yeah, this would be more amethyst, right? Yeah. This one looks
[4099.94s -> 4104.74s]  almost like the one, the really hollow one. Probably from the same family. Same place,
[4104.74s -> 4109.70s]  probably, yeah. Probably from the same exact mine, right? Because they pull these out of a mine.
[4109.70s -> 4122.30s]  Yep. Cool. I don't think that's, what? What? What are you, you're not supposed to eat rocks.
[4123.18s -> 4131.33s]  Why not? I do it all the time. All right. What about, this one's bumpy. This one's bumpy.
[4132.05s -> 4137.39s]  We'll try this one. I'll try. I'll save that one for later.
[4140.99s -> 4156.78s]  Really bumpy. This one's got bumps. So is there a reason why this is bumpy on the outside?
[4157.50s -> 4161.90s]  It's just a reflection of how they probably mined it out of the lava flow. Cool. I'm at,
[4161.90s -> 4171.62s]  that's, let me get it in the center. All right, ready? Three, two, one. Let's go.
[4172.26s -> 4184.42s]  Yeah. Whoa. That's a pretty one. That's a really pretty one. It's kind of wedged in there.
[4185.81s -> 4191.09s]  Wow. That looks unbelievable. So I think what we're looking at here is quartz again,
[4191.09s -> 4195.49s]  but because it's kind of that grayish color, that's a variety called smoky quartz.
[4196.37s -> 4200.29s]  What causes the smoky color in the quartz, the grayish color, is aluminum rather than the
[4200.29s -> 4207.39s]  iron that's in the amethyst. This one looks awesome. It almost looks like, it's dark too.
[4207.87s -> 4212.86s]  So you said quartz is the most common mineral in the world? On the surface of the planet. Yep.
[4214.30s -> 4220.59s]  Well, it sure does look pretty darn pretty. Let's do, let's do this one. Okay. Get it in there.
[4221.39s -> 4231.33s]  This one's big. All right, let's go for this. This one, why does this one look weird? Why does
[4231.33s -> 4235.41s]  this one look so interesting? I don't know. This is unlike the other ones we've seen. It's really
[4235.41s -> 4241.36s]  smooth. This one's really smooth. It's covered, it's got a lot of dirt on it. I've never seen
[4241.36s -> 4247.57s]  one like that before. Yeah, I know. This is really interesting. You ready? One, two, three.
[4254.03s -> 4265.68s]  What's in there? I'm not sure. Oh my God. It's Minecraft diamonds.
[4267.20s -> 4275.76s]  Wow. I can't believe it. It's even in a very cool packaging. It's even inside of a little bubble.
[4276.48s -> 4280.40s]  But that must be, that must be an air bubble. I'm going to defer to you on this one.
[4281.52s -> 4287.36s]  The water must have flowed over the air and created an air bubble inside of this rocket,
[4287.36s -> 4297.92s]  diamond rock. Wow. You see it? Get a closer look. Actually, this is really cool. It's like a claw.
[4298.72s -> 4305.55s]  Well, that's, that's a new one for me. You've never seen a Minecraft diamond?
[4305.55s -> 4317.23s]  No, that's first. You can get a good look. There it is. Preserved forever. Okay. Very cool.
[4318.59s -> 4324.77s]  All right. What about this? This guy is already like kind of, he's kind of already got a little.
[4324.77s -> 4332.46s]  It's begging for it. Yeah. It's ready. You're going to get a look at that. This one is like
[4332.46s -> 4341.28s]  already down the middle. So that's what we're going to do it. I can't believe we found Minecraft
[4341.28s -> 4353.15s]  diamonds. I can't either. Let's get it in there. All right. And on the count of three, I want you
[4353.15s -> 4363.52s]  to say one, two, three science. One, two, three. Guys are fucking clowns. Oh, wait, hold on.
[4364.32s -> 4374.61s]  It needs to be tighter. So you, you're, you run an organization. I do the Nevada science center
[4374.61s -> 4381.76s]  in downtown Henderson, Nevada. He was there. Two of them were very nice enough to come down here
[4381.76s -> 4388.05s]  and help us do all this. So support your local science centers, especially this one. You're ready?
[4389.47s -> 4395.94s]  Three, two, one. I didn't tell you to say it that time. It's still not tight enough.
[4396.58s -> 4405.44s]  Can be a little bit tighter. You might have to go like, come on, let's go. Science. There we are.
[4408.11s -> 4412.24s]  Change it up to this way. It's a little bumpy, so it has to be,
[4412.96s -> 4418.19s]  get his ass to get really taught. That's taught. All right. That'll do it.
[4422.03s -> 4434.53s]  Okay. One, two, three, science. Hey, one, two, three. Thank you. Excellent. There it goes.
[4439.89s -> 4447.01s]  More quartz. Really pretty quartz one. Oh, wow. This is deep. Yeah. That's got a really deep cavity
[4447.01s -> 4451.89s]  in there. Check this one out. If you look down in there, you can see some nice crystals too.
[4452.53s -> 4457.20s]  Oh, yeah. It's like buried in there. How does this even, how,
[4457.20s -> 4459.84s]  our world is so bizarre. How does this even happen?
[4461.62s -> 4466.02s]  When lava flow is making its way across the landscape, there's bubbles of gas in there.
[4466.02s -> 4470.58s]  And so when the lava flow freezes into a rock, the air bubbles to get stuck in there too.
[4471.22s -> 4475.94s]  We have such a bizarre planet. Like how would Doritos even be? Like it's just insane to me.
[4475.94s -> 4481.30s]  Some questions you better not answer. Let's do a big one. I think it's time for a big one.
[4481.30s -> 4486.26s]  What do you think? Do a big, we got three, we have two huge ones. Let's do a big one.
[4487.30s -> 4492.50s]  So originally we thought these were, may have been concrete, but they are not. It has been
[4492.50s -> 4498.10s]  confirmed that this is real. It is real. And can you explain why it's real? If you look closely,
[4498.10s -> 4501.86s]  you can actually see the air pockets that were around the main geode. And so that just shows
[4501.86s -> 4505.94s]  that there was lots of gas in this lava flow. And the geodes just happened to be the biggest,
[4505.94s -> 4513.33s]  biggest air voids that were in the rock. So should we, we should probably do it if we can
[4513.33s -> 4522.06s]  this way, right? Let's see if we can do it. My like $12 costume is starting to undo from the back.
[4522.86s -> 4526.34s]  All right, let's see. Right down the middle here.
[4530.38s -> 4537.20s]  Oh yeah. Let me hold the rock a little and then order of mouth. Thank you. It's a little
[4537.20s -> 4543.34s]  embarrassing. Is it embarrassing? Is it actually embarrassing? Oh, okay. All right. I think we got
[4543.34s -> 4546.54s]  it in a good spot. This is one of the big ones. This is the big ticket item right here. Are you
[4546.54s -> 4558.22s]  ready? Let's see if I can do this with my measly like worm arms. Here we go. Let's see if I can
[4558.22s -> 4578.27s]  get it to break. Is it going? Do it. Oh, it popped. Oh my God. I think your guests are in for a treat.
[4578.27s -> 4584.35s]  That looks insane from back here. Let's go ahead and hold the rock. Got it. Let's lift this out.
[4584.35s -> 4595.70s]  Careful. There we go. Oh my God. Wow. That's a beautiful amethyst geode. Look at, look at all,
[4595.70s -> 4599.54s]  look at all this in here. It's like a brain. It looks like the inside of somebody's head.
[4601.02s -> 4605.90s]  And you can see here there's a, it kind of goes from kind of a solid color to kind of a
[4605.90s -> 4611.42s]  clearish to the purple. That's the fluids through time changing as the, as the crystals,
[4611.42s -> 4616.38s]  as the crystals were growing in this geode. Wow. So what, what, what's going on down here? Like the,
[4616.38s -> 4621.90s]  kind of that, that gray. Like this stuff? Yeah. These are secondary minerals. And so these were
[4621.90s -> 4625.74s]  the first minerals to grow. And then there was obviously a second or not obviously, but I should
[4625.74s -> 4630.62s]  say there was a second phase of minerals growing. That's what these other ones are. It's like a
[4630.62s -> 4636.88s]  membrane. This is insane. That's all right. This is like, hold on to this one. Let's go. I want to
[4636.88s -> 4646.37s]  get, see if we can get this over here. Can we get like a good, can we get in there? See what's in
[4646.37s -> 4656.10s]  there? That looks awesome. It's an awesome purple too. Look at these. It's like, it's like a shark
[4656.10s -> 4666.54s]  fin. Well, that was worth it. That was absolutely worth it. That was awesome. All right. Should we
[4666.54s -> 4674.14s]  do a, I, I know this is going to be last, but like, my God, it's huge. Uh, let's, let's get a
[4674.14s -> 4680.54s]  couple here. We have like seven or eight more after this. All right. We're going to do rapid
[4680.54s -> 4692.74s]  fire. Let's see if we can get a couple. So what, what does your organization do? So we are a
[4692.74s -> 4697.54s]  research institution. So we'd go do geology, paleontology around the state of Nevada. And we
[4697.54s -> 4702.42s]  also do lots of educational outreach. So right now with COVID, we're doing lots of virtual field
[4702.42s -> 4707.94s]  trips. So just check out the website. That's so, that's so cool. You get to actually go on a
[4707.94s -> 4714.98s]  field trip, but with COVID you can't. So that's cool. Is this? Oh, one more. Virtual field trips.
[4716.58s -> 4728.58s]  There we go. One more. Get that one in there. Hey, there we go. Here we go.
[4730.40s -> 4735.86s]  Crush it. This is kind of, so this totally, this highlight is going to be total ASMR, isn't it?
[4738.62s -> 4747.36s]  Ooh. What happened? That is a, has like a shard coming out of the other half is empty. Yes. We've
[4747.36s -> 4752.56s]  got the smoky quartz in here again. So that gray variety of quartz, and then we have calcite growing
[4752.56s -> 4758.08s]  in here. Secondarily calcite, calcite, the white blady stuff. Oh, so that's a couple of different
[4758.08s -> 4762.96s]  phases, different types of fluids passing through this thing. This is so cool. Let's see that one.
[4764.08s -> 4767.28s]  Yeah. Let me get a closer with this one. This one has like a blade in it.
[4768.70s -> 4773.98s]  This is like the coolest thing I've ever done. This is like the most fun I've ever had in my life.
[4775.42s -> 4787.10s]  Look at that. Just like a blade going through it. Wow. And this is a huge display here.
[4788.98s -> 4792.98s]  All right. How about, oh, there's the other still over there. Let's get this little one.
[4794.34s -> 4805.17s]  Let's get this little guy. This one's also pretty dirty. Very dirty. Yeah, geodeform and all sorts
[4805.17s -> 4812.14s]  of different geologic processes. So all right, let's see what's in here. Ready? Let's do it.
[4814.26s -> 4821.79s]  And that, oh my God, those are, those are stardew valley seed packets. Ah, it's not that great.
[4822.51s -> 4826.19s]  That's too bad. It would be nice if there was some like fiery quartz in there or something.
[4828.30s -> 4832.94s]  And they're also the way that the water flows over the air creates a, this is a little bit
[4832.94s -> 4837.82s]  different process. A little bit different. We'll call it anthropogenic.
[4839.30s -> 4846.98s]  Yeah, this is anthropogenic, which means it kind of, you know, enclosed bubble. Of sorts. Of sorts.
[4847.94s -> 4858.08s]  But pog, stardew valley seed packets. It's a pretty pog champ. Wow. Oh, you didn't think there
[4858.08s -> 4865.01s]  was going to be comedy here. You didn't think there was going to be comedy. This is, my back is,
[4865.01s -> 4872.48s]  this is embarrassing. Wardrobe malfunction. Just hope it doesn't like fly down. That looks good.
[4873.28s -> 4881.38s]  Could be one more. I can't wait to do that huge one. That's going to be cool. I do, just by looking
[4881.38s -> 4885.95s]  at that, do you have any idea what could be in there? No, I mean, every single one of these is
[4885.95s -> 4890.93s]  a surprise. You never know until you pop them open. That's so cool. I could literally do this
[4890.93s -> 4901.25s]  every day, all day. Here we go. That one's also kind of like empty. That's the smoky quartz variety.
[4902.13s -> 4905.33s]  But this one obviously didn't have a whole lot of fluids pumping through it because the minerals
[4905.33s -> 4913.66s]  are really small and we got mostly hollow space. Yeah, it's almost like perfectly,
[4913.66s -> 4919.82s]  it's like a perfect circle inside. It's a perfect circle of just nothing. An air bubble in a rock.
[4919.82s -> 4923.42s]  An air, yeah, kind of like the stardew valley seed packets in the Minecraft diamonds that we
[4923.42s -> 4929.86s]  found earlier. It's really nothing like that. It could be. Oh, look, there it is, the Minecraft
[4929.86s -> 4936.88s]  diamonds. All right, we're getting, we're getting to, what we got, one, two, three, four, five, six,
[4936.88s -> 4941.33s]  seven, eight, nine. We've got, we'll do three more little ones and we're going to do this guy here.
[4942.61s -> 4952.88s]  That one, this is like, I can't wait to see what's in there. Oh, we also have that one too. Now this
[4952.88s -> 4959.01s]  one already has stuff. We're going to tape it this time. Are you going to tape it? Yeah. If you, if
[4959.01s -> 4963.97s]  you look closely, you can see kind of that texture on it. That's, it's quartz, but it's microscopic
[4963.97s -> 4968.77s]  quartz. It has some water in it. So it's called, yeah, so it's called agate. So if you hear somebody
[4968.77s -> 4972.53s]  talk about agate, it's just a special type of quartz. Oh, cool. Well, let's see if there's
[4972.53s -> 4977.41s]  any more inside. And this is a little, so this would break pretty easily. Famous last words.
[4978.45s -> 4984.18s]  This is about, watch this be harder than all of them. You guys having fun? I don't know what
[4984.18s -> 4995.76s]  camera's on. Snap it. Crotch. That's one of the coolest ones so far. Cool. Let me lift this up.
[4996.56s -> 5004.51s]  Wow. It's like, it's got like little tendrils. This is insane looking. Look at that. How does it,
[5004.51s -> 5010.27s]  why does this happen? This is a secondary type of quartz mineralization. And so it makes these
[5010.27s -> 5016.51s]  kind of weird finger like structures. It looks like a thread. They're delicate too. Even though
[5016.51s -> 5019.87s]  it's made out of the stuff that makes up the crust of our planet, it's actually a really delicate
[5019.87s -> 5024.11s]  mineral. So you could actually like break these pretty with your finger. I kind of don't want to.
[5024.11s -> 5030.43s]  I want to keep it intact. Let's get it underneath here. Underneath our, our patented microscopic
[5030.43s -> 5041.47s]  camber technology. Look at that. Cool. That's really cool. Look at this one. This one, they're
[5041.47s -> 5047.89s]  even finer on this one. And that's when we get lots of water interacting in our, in our geode.
[5047.89s -> 5052.05s]  Wow. That's so cool. That's probably, that's one of my favorite ones so far.
[5052.85s -> 5059.55s]  What is this? This one is, what's this one? Oh, it doesn't look like one of the geodes, does it?
[5059.63s -> 5069.55s]  Um, I mean, it's a little bit different shape. Well, no. Isn't that your teeth?
[5071.07s -> 5076.67s]  This is a, um, this is a smoky, a smoky granite. I can tell by the flavor.
[5077.63s -> 5082.91s]  Smoky granite with a hint, a dog peed on it. I think I'm going to be over by the crusher.
[5082.91s -> 5087.47s]  Okay. Dog peed on this probably like a couple years ago. I can smell the formaldehyde from the
[5087.47s -> 5095.15s]  dog pee. Okay. Yep. What, not formaldehyde. What's the word? Ammonia, right? Yeah. All right.
[5095.15s -> 5106.38s]  Let's do this one. Crushing machines. That was good. You want to try? Well, I'll take your word
[5106.38s -> 5110.14s]  for it. Okay. No, it's, it's, it's delicious. I guess you do need some silks in your diet.
[5110.70s -> 5123.55s]  Yeah. Oh yeah. Here we go. No not. Swing and a miss. Swing and a miss. Strike one. There we go.
[5123.55s -> 5130.74s]  See if we get any more, any more squid rocks. This one's tough.
[5131.46s -> 5140.70s]  Hold on. One more. There it is. That's a nice pretty quartz one again. You got some really
[5140.70s -> 5145.10s]  nice crystal faces, especially on this one right here. So would you, okay. So for all of us video
[5145.10s -> 5150.94s]  gamers out there, would you qualify this as like a common? Would you qualify the amethyst as like
[5150.94s -> 5155.26s]  kind of rare to see that? Like the purple? Um, in the world of quartz, I'd say amethyst is more of
[5155.26s -> 5159.34s]  a rare, but I would say like there's nothing more common than this. Okay. So what would you say is
[5159.34s -> 5163.82s]  like a like, wow, legendary status, like I can't believe that's in there. Legendary status would be
[5165.10s -> 5169.98s]  if we had some really nice sulfide minerals. Okay. So those are things like cobalite or things
[5169.98s -> 5174.62s]  like that, really brilliant blue colors. So is that possible in something in one of these?
[5174.62s -> 5178.06s]  Potentially. I mean, it just depends on what was in the groundwater that was going through.
[5178.06s -> 5181.98s]  So we got, how many, how many like card packs do we have left open before we get like our legendary?
[5182.54s -> 5186.78s]  Well, if it's anything like some of those games, at least another five to $700 worth. Apparently
[5186.78s -> 5194.91s]  we had Minecraft diamonds. We did get Minecraft diamonds. It's great. Uh, we got that guy there.
[5194.91s -> 5200.94s]  I keep forgetting to do that one. Uh, these two look cool. I'm getting sad that there's only like
[5201.58s -> 5207.66s]  five to 10 left to do. No, it can't. I, I just have to continue. I need to do this like every
[5207.66s -> 5221.25s]  minute of my life. It's like geologic Christmas. Let's get it in there. There it is. All right.
[5221.25s -> 5235.01s]  It's in a good spot. You want to do the honors on this one? Crunch. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Oh,
[5235.01s -> 5240.45s]  you got a squid rock squid. Okay. See the little finger courts in there. Oh, there's like tiny
[5240.45s -> 5245.06s]  little fingers. Oh, hold on to that one. Look at, look, can you see that? I'll put it in the
[5245.06s -> 5251.28s]  microscopic camera technology that we have double zoom technology. Can you see in there,
[5253.50s -> 5261.10s]  there is this really, really bizarre looking like swirl. Can you see it? I don't think you can see
[5261.10s -> 5266.88s]  it. There's like a little swirly at the very bottom of this one. I don't know if you can pick
[5266.88s -> 5271.52s]  it up. I think that's the agate. So I think you're getting the really water rich courts in there.
[5272.16s -> 5275.68s]  Yeah, it's really deep. This goes all the way in and look at the fingers on this one.
[5278.37s -> 5286.62s]  Get in there. See the tiny little like, uh, like, like flora or something, right? That's so awesome.
[5288.02s -> 5298.35s]  All right. Time for a big guy. Oh, this one is really, this one's really heavy.
[5299.55s -> 5306.11s]  This one is extraordinarily heavy. All right. Yeah. So we're, we're going to try to get this
[5306.11s -> 5310.91s]  long ways if it's possible. So that being that heavy is what kind of a sign is that?
[5310.91s -> 5315.95s]  I think we're going to have, it's going to be full. So. Oh wow. Hope we have enough chain to do them
[5315.95s -> 5325.22s]  all. Yeah. A little more slack. We're popping out over here. Oh man. Down maybe around here.
[5326.34s -> 5332.96s]  There. That looks good. Oh, this guy, this is going to work. We're good. We have just enough
[5332.96s -> 5335.44s]  chance. I don't know if we can, if we're going to be able to wait up to get your hammer for the next
[5335.44s -> 5348.72s]  month. There. All right. That's in. Oh wow. All right. This is it. Oh man. Here we go. You ready?
[5350.42s -> 5357.36s]  Oh God. All right. Come on. Cobalt blue, cobalt blue, cobalt blue. Everybody think it and we'll
[5357.36s -> 5382.19s]  get it. We need a legendary. Here we go. Come on. Oh, it doesn't want to do it. Oh, do we have any
[5382.19s -> 5397.23s]  score? We gotta go down one more rung. I could feel it too. It's about to go. Let's see if we
[5397.23s -> 5409.50s]  can get it up here. All right. Oh, that'll do it. Oh yeah. Here we go.
[5416.56s -> 5427.71s]  Crap. We might have to maybe this way. Oh, look at the score. It's right there.
[5428.59s -> 5432.67s]  Uh, can we get? Yeah. It'll probably be easier to get like two people to hold it.
[5433.39s -> 5446.66s]  Oh, thank God for production Jake. Also known as community Jake. All right. So that's right there.
[5448.11s -> 5456.96s]  There it is. All right. Lift it up a little. Get it in there. All right. Is that it? Maybe. Maybe.
[5456.96s -> 5462.35s]  Let's give it a try. Let's see if I can get it. Watch your hands. Yeah. This is it. This is it.
[5463.92s -> 5466.24s]  All right. We're good. We got to go. You got a good shot of this.
[5469.90s -> 5473.66s]  Oh, we might need a few people to help with this one. You want to, you want to,
[5473.66s -> 5491.98s]  you want to try to, we'll put some weight here. Oh, come on. It's so close. Yeah. Do it.
[5494.62s -> 5498.22s]  Come on. Break. Break. We're not breaking the tool. Are we?
[5498.30s -> 5512.56s]  Wow. Oh my God. Oh my God. Holy shit. That looks insane. You got to get this part up here.
[5514.10s -> 5520.32s]  Look at that. They sell that stuff in stores. They sell this stuff that you see that in the stores.
[5520.32s -> 5523.92s]  If you're born in February, this is your birthstone. What is that? It's amethyst? Uh-huh.
[5524.88s -> 5528.48s]  No cobalt. No cobalt, but that's pretty. That looks unbelievable.
[5530.96s -> 5537.54s]  Wow. These jaw. This is a display piece. That's what this is. Oh my goodness. Can
[5537.54s -> 5544.72s]  we get this out of here? That took so much. I wonder, can you see?
[5549.39s -> 5553.38s]  What we got? Can you see? Well, that's like, look at somebody's teeth.
[5556.32s -> 5557.04s]  That's beautiful.
[5558.00s -> 5568.51s]  Can you get in there, David? Look what I did, Bobby. How's it look?
[5570.03s -> 5576.99s]  Wow. We are probably going to need like three or four of us to pull that one.
[5577.87s -> 5584.77s]  That one is going to be very difficult. That's unbelievable. That's so cool. Oh, wow. All right.
[5585.33s -> 5592.43s]  Well, now let's relax a little bit and do a couple of the smaller ones. Look at this here.
[5595.26s -> 5600.38s]  So is there something that makes it more purple? It's just the amount of iron. It's actually just
[5600.38s -> 5605.90s]  microscopic amounts. Just that tiny little impurity can completely change the nature
[5605.90s -> 5610.80s]  and color of the mineral. Wow. And this has like blue under, what's the blue underneath?
[5611.92s -> 5616.56s]  To me, that looks a little bit like copper ore. So there was probably some copper mineralization
[5616.56s -> 5624.70s]  before the quartz came in. That goes to air, it turns that greenish color. Oh, look at that.
[5625.66s -> 5634.10s]  Yeah. They drop it on the ground. They put this on necklaces. You buy that and put it on a necklace.
[5636.13s -> 5641.89s]  That's so cool. All right. Let's move. Oh, this is heavy too. All right. Let's do a couple more.
[5641.89s -> 5646.93s]  That was by far the best one. And that was an explosion too. Did you get the explosion on camera?
[5646.93s -> 5656.11s]  Yeah. Oh yeah. Somebody slow mow that one. Just don't show our faces.
[5657.07s -> 5665.17s]  Oh, it's just like playing tug of war with a geode. All right. Right. Let's do this one.
[5665.81s -> 5673.33s]  That was very easy. And? Cool. Oh, more tendrils. One of those finger quartz structures.
[5676.54s -> 5685.28s]  Well, this one is even smaller. So what's the, is this just sand? What's the brown and...
[5686.08s -> 5694.64s]  Let me take a look. Yeah. Those are probably some sort of aluminum mineral would be my guess. Cool.
[5695.60s -> 5698.88s]  So how does it get in there? Again, this is all, everything that's in this
[5698.88s -> 5701.84s]  former air bubble has to get there through groundwater. So water just...
[5702.72s -> 5705.04s]  Yeah. There's all sorts of minerals in your groundwater.
[5706.24s -> 5712.16s]  Depending on where you live, it's different types of minerals. Look at this guy here.
[5712.96s -> 5719.58s]  Does the pink mean anything important? That's just the type of volcano,
[5719.58s -> 5723.66s]  volcanic eruption it came from. So that one has probably lots of quartz in it.
[5723.66s -> 5728.62s]  It's going to be quartz. I hope we get, I hope that one is filled with like blue,
[5728.62s -> 5740.35s]  legendary crystal. How many do we have left? Just a kind of naked eye. Only six left.
[5741.23s -> 5758.29s]  All right. And want to give this one a pull? Sure. Another one of the fingers.
[5760.77s -> 5764.94s]  Ooh. So is there a reason, can you see like the waves in there?
[5765.74s -> 5771.23s]  It's almost like a spiral. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. What would cause a spiral like that? It's
[5771.23s -> 5776.03s]  just however the water was interacting with the substrate. So. So it's all water. Each one of
[5776.03s -> 5779.55s]  these air bubbles is its own little micro environment. So each one's going to be unique.
[5780.43s -> 5785.50s]  Yeah. So maybe this one can show up on the air. Well, I haven't looked at Chad in like an hour.
[5788.18s -> 5799.36s]  Oh no, not the spiral. Team Tendril. Team Tendril. Can you see? Let's get a look down here.
[5801.36s -> 5805.17s]  Okay. Yeah. I don't know if you can pick it up, but see like the center.
[5805.89s -> 5815.98s]  It just got like this weird spiral. That's awesome. The sadness is washing over me.
[5818.54s -> 5827.39s]  Get this up here. So just out of curiosity, if there was like
[5827.95s -> 5833.55s]  cobalt in here, would that, would that be worth anything? It'd be worth something in terms of
[5833.55s -> 5838.75s]  cobalt itself is a highly desirable mineral in metal because of what it does for technology.
[5838.75s -> 5849.22s]  And it's also desirable just as a collecting item too. Oh, he's coming to fix. Logos on here.
[5851.78s -> 5858.02s]  Wait, like Star Wars, Star Wars logo. I'm here to protect you. You're here to help me?
[5858.02s -> 5861.70s]  Cause this is, this is literally the bag costume of Poe from Star Wars.
[5862.50s -> 5867.94s]  Oh, that's what we're trying to be trying to protect me. Oh, thank you. I appreciate it.
[5870.66s -> 5884.90s]  Here we go. This is, this one's the thick one. It's tight. Wow. There we go. Maybe even more in
[5884.90s -> 5892.83s]  the center. I feel like this one's going to be a good one. Maybe move it a little. There we go.
[5895.22s -> 5907.42s]  This one's thick. Get in there. Right there. Right there. Right down the middle. Right there. All
[5907.42s -> 5923.44s]  right. That should be it. It's a process. There we go. All right. That's the money. That's the,
[5923.44s -> 5936.56s]  that's the money, right? Yeah, it is. Absolutely. Here we go. Oh, that one was hard. That was a
[5936.56s -> 5943.82s]  reason why the, oh, it's a nice pretty quartz one. It's like furry. Oh, those are just microscopic
[5943.82s -> 5948.30s]  or not microscopic, but they're just tiny little quartz crystals. Wow. This one, you can kind of
[5948.30s -> 5953.58s]  see that two stage growth again, where you got agate and then quartz crystals. Wow. Let me see
[5953.58s -> 5960.88s]  this one. Let's see if we can get this on another camera. I'm waiting for the blue. We might not get
[5960.88s -> 5966.62s]  it. These are still pretty spectacular. Yeah, these are awesome. Because correct me if I'm wrong,
[5966.62s -> 5970.62s]  but these could all be duds, right? There could be nothing in it. You never know when you get a
[5970.62s -> 5974.86s]  geode. Sometimes you crack them open and they're just still in their air pockets. So how hard are
[5974.86s -> 5977.98s]  we going to laugh when we open the huge one? It's just literally a rock. There's nothing in it.
[5980.19s -> 5985.15s]  That's part of the fun. That is part of the fun. Let's bring a couple of these baseball ones over.
[5993.76s -> 5999.60s]  All right. Here we go. This one should go pretty quickly.
[6001.95s -> 6009.87s]  Safety first as always. And let's give it a pull. Here we go. One, two, three. That looks interesting.
[6011.41s -> 6015.97s]  I saw like the brown. Oh, that is actually really interesting. We got some of those calcite blades
[6015.97s -> 6026.26s]  again. So team blade. Calcite's mineral. It makes up a limestone. Oh, so is this quartz still?
[6026.26s -> 6030.61s]  No, this is a different mineral. So that's limestone. Yep. This is in pretty form.
[6031.81s -> 6036.37s]  There's so many different kinds of rocks. Could you spend an entire lifetime
[6036.37s -> 6041.73s]  trying to like find it? No, it's like randomly generated. No two rocks are the same. No two rocks
[6041.73s -> 6045.49s]  are the same. And there are people that spend their entire careers out there looking for new
[6045.49s -> 6048.37s]  types of rocks and they're still naming new minerals. So there's stuff out there we don't
[6048.37s -> 6053.89s]  even know about yet. Involve in your local science community now. You see how cool this is? I wish,
[6053.89s -> 6060.53s]  I'm 35. If I was like 20, oh my God, I would start doing this. This is the coolest thing I've
[6060.53s -> 6082.32s]  ever done in my whole life. Let me get that situated. In there? Almost. All right. And again,
[6082.32s -> 6088.32s]  that's ScienceCenterNevada.org. Correct. Yes, come visit and our schedule of virtual field trips is
[6088.32s -> 6092.96s]  on there. Go take a virtual field trip. Think of how cool that would be. Go take a virtual field
[6092.96s -> 6097.36s]  trip. And they're at no cost to the public. It's free. Wait, hold on. I want to make that,
[6097.36s -> 6104.64s]  did you hear that? It was free. Don't panic. Passionate people. Support them. A little bit,
[6104.64s -> 6125.17s]  a little bit tighter. Here we go. This one was almost a dud, but we did get a couple minerals
[6125.17s -> 6132.06s]  in it. That's close to a dud, you're right. So a true dud would just be like the limestone. It'd
[6132.06s -> 6137.58s]  just be rock, yeah. Rock. I'm surprised we've had any that'll like that. No duds yet. Zero. No duds
[6137.58s -> 6144.94s]  at all. We don't have jinks at all. Yeah, it's going to be the big one. It has to be. The big
[6144.94s -> 6149.92s]  one's going to be a dud and I'm scared of it. You've already resigned yourself to it? Yeah,
[6149.92s -> 6155.39s]  because then if it's awesome, then we get to all be excited. I think that's called low expectations,
[6155.39s -> 6166.13s]  right? Yeah. Very low expectations, but very high reward if it is good. Here we go again.
[6170.72s -> 6180.37s]  Looks like snow. That's all agate in there. That's that water rich quartz. Get it under
[6180.37s -> 6196.64s]  the microscopic camera. You get a good look. Can I see the chat? What's it saying? Geode Andy?
[6203.60s -> 6214.42s]  Geode Andy. No, I think he's Andy. No, it's not Andy from Toy Story. You got that wrong. Oh wait,
[6214.42s -> 6224.82s]  I look like Andy from Toy Story. Oh my God.
[6228.96s -> 6237.06s]  Take this off. Get this off. It's a bandana. Get it off. Hey, did you know that every Andy,
[6237.06s -> 6242.26s]  no, every little kid in Toy Story is an Andy? Did you know that? They didn't want to animate
[6242.26s -> 6248.34s]  extra kids so they're all Andy. Look it up. That's a real thing. This is like bolted on my neck.
[6249.14s -> 6273.49s]  There we go. Geode Andy. I got it. Oh, another close dud. That's cool. Let's get like a little
[6273.49s -> 6278.80s]  slice. Little quartz crystals in there. That's really cool. I'm just looking at these on the
[6278.80s -> 6289.38s]  ground. It's like, that's awesome. All right, we are down to the final five regular ones. We
[6289.38s -> 6294.75s]  have no legendaries yet, which is, you know, whatever. And then we got this guy. This is
[6294.75s -> 6302.54s]  probably going to take like everybody on set. Let's do the last six. Oh wait, we have an extra one
[6302.54s -> 6331.26s]  here. Geode Andy. Come on, Rock. Oh, that might do it. Well, now that's different. What's the
[6331.26s -> 6339.79s]  orange? The orange is a lot of iron minerals. So this one's kind of a dud. Out of the shadow.
[6340.35s -> 6345.95s]  Now that's done. There's a little quartz crust. Oh, your half is way better. Oh, is my better?
[6345.95s -> 6352.08s]  Yeah, you got lots of little quartz crystals in there. Let's get a close-up. Oh, sorry.
[6354.42s -> 6357.30s]  What do we got for a stream time? How long have I been doing this for? I'm just like, I'm just
[6357.30s -> 6365.06s]  obsessed. Yeah, one hour and 50. Oh, cool. All right. This is awesome. All right, let's keep going.
[6371.39s -> 6382.00s]  Yeah, I'll get in there and do it after this. All right, here we go. Come on, Cobalt. Legendary.
[6382.64s -> 6399.36s]  This one's tight. Pretty amethyst one. The amethyst. Whoa, what's going on here?
[6400.24s -> 6407.73s]  What's at the bottom? That like weird like brown and beige. Yeah, you've got a different type of
[6407.73s -> 6415.49s]  quartz crystal starting to grow in there. So the agate grew inside the hole, then the amethyst grew,
[6415.49s -> 6419.25s]  and then there was water starting to come in again and there was a third phase of mineral growth
[6419.25s -> 6422.37s]  starting in there. But so here's a really good question for you. Oh, these look
[6423.50s -> 6427.34s]  they're like little triangles. Beautiful. I got a good question for you. How long does this take
[6427.34s -> 6433.74s]  to happen? Thousands of years. Thousands of years. If not millions, yeah. Millions or a thousand. Wow.
[6434.54s -> 6441.44s]  Let's get some detail on this one. Try to get the light to hit it. I'm not sure how well you can see
[6441.44s -> 6445.68s]  the sun is starting to change a little. What is that? Looks really good. Does it look good?
[6446.48s -> 6454.13s]  Look at those little triangles. Those are called the crystal faces. Crystal faces. Very cool.
[6456.29s -> 6463.81s]  All leading up to the final gigantic one, which we'll see. This is I think this is the smallest
[6463.81s -> 6470.78s]  one so far. This is a little guy. How heavy is it? I don't know. It's not bad. What do you think?
[6473.15s -> 6475.71s]  So again, the heavier this is, the more it could be inside.
[6476.99s -> 6479.31s]  I thought it was just burped right into the camera, which would have been weird.
[6480.27s -> 6503.57s]  I get it up there. And again, safety first. Workers gloves. Here we go. Team Tendril.
[6504.46s -> 6508.62s]  You've got another crewmate. That one was heavy because it was pretty full of minerals. Yeah.
[6509.26s -> 6512.43s]  It's a pretty one. These would look a little more clear too.
[6513.71s -> 6518.18s]  Oh, you want to get the detail of that other one, right? This one here.
[6521.14s -> 6528.53s]  Yeah. Right here. This one here. What was the orange rock you said?
[6528.53s -> 6533.49s]  It's probably some iron rich rock. Oftentimes you get lots of metals that are in lava flows.
[6536.13s -> 6539.01s]  This looks like a map. Like if I pressed M in a game,
[6539.01s -> 6543.60s]  I got to tie it back to the gamers. You know what I mean? I just saw like the cut.
[6545.52s -> 6548.72s]  I'm trying to catch the cut. I can see the monitor here. Take another one.
[6552.43s -> 6562.43s]  How's that look? Get a good shot of that. A snake head?
[6562.91s -> 6569.02s]  Tendril on the top. Oh, okay. Oh, it does. You're right. It does look like a snake.
[6570.21s -> 6576.50s]  Right there. Right at the top. Very cool. What are you guys saying? Crack rock.
[6580.50s -> 6588.06s]  Well, that's not what it is. All right. We got one, two, three, and that's it. And then we got to
[6588.06s -> 6593.02s]  bring it. We got to bring in the big guy. It's so funny when you said, is that the rock breaking
[6593.02s -> 6602.96s]  or is that the tool breaking? I can already see the quartz coming out of the edge here.
[6603.76s -> 6609.25s]  So this is going to be a quartz, Andy. Let me get a little bit more.
[6621.70s -> 6627.15s]  Very, very heavy quartz crack rock, Andy. Yeah, that one's a nice one. Nice pure quartz. You can
[6627.15s -> 6633.92s]  see the nice crystal faces in there glimmering in the sun. It's just about the water, right? So
[6633.92s -> 6639.12s]  when they like fill in deep into the middle, that just does that mean that they have more time?
[6639.12s -> 6643.44s]  More time. Exactly. More time for those minerals to grow and grow on top of each other and fill in
[6643.44s -> 6649.52s]  that void. Awesome. That's so cool. This is like, like rethinking my entire life choices here doing
[6649.52s -> 6655.12s]  this. I should have been a geologist. This is like, I get it. This is the coolest thing ever.
[6655.92s -> 6661.39s]  You know, after this one, I think I've got to get going before a place closes in town.
[6662.03s -> 6666.43s]  Okay. Yeah, that's fine. But after this one. Yeah, that's cool. Thanks for, seriously,
[6666.43s -> 6670.51s]  thanks for coming. You got something, you got to go somewhere. You got to be somewhere, right?
[6670.51s -> 6675.23s]  My pleasure. Science Center. We always aim to educate. Yeah. And again, that's
[6675.23s -> 6682.64s]  sciencecenternevada.org. They do field trips, virtual field trips, support them. Because honestly,
[6683.20s -> 6688.32s]  without them, this kind of doesn't happen because I don't know anything about what's inside of these
[6688.32s -> 6706.50s]  rocks. I'm just the clown that cracks the nuts. Here we go. Oh, go for it. Oh, do we got something
[6706.50s -> 6718.05s]  good? Pretty agate. Oh, this one's awesome. That nice cloudy texture. Oh, let's see like the,
[6718.05s -> 6725.66s]  that's cool. Looks like a pair of eyes. Let's get a close-up. I got, we got to get a close-up of this
[6725.66s -> 6734.11s]  one. What's that? No, it's purple. That's not blue. No, we don't have any legendaries, unfortunately.
[6735.15s -> 6746.77s]  Look at that. Nice. Beautiful. It's been a pleasure. Thank you for having me today. Yeah,
[6746.77s -> 6750.69s]  thank you. No, seriously, thank you for coming out here and doing this because this is impossible
[6750.69s -> 6755.57s]  without your help. So thank you so much. That's sciencecenternevada.org. Support your local
[6755.57s -> 6761.76s]  scientists, your local educators, please, for the love of God. Thank you for coming. Thank you. It's
[6761.76s -> 6770.37s]  been a pleasure. Seriously. Got somewhere to go. Let's go. We got two more. We got the big one
[6770.37s -> 6785.57s]  that's left. I'm gonna get the whole crew up in that last one. That was awesome. That was seriously
[6785.57s -> 6791.70s]  awesome. That's why you gotta get somebody that knows what they're talking about. Go like this.
[6791.78s -> 6797.87s]  Because, oh yeah, I could have done this stream and just, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna sit here
[6797.87s -> 6821.95s]  and go, whoa, whoa, oh, but I don't know anything. Here we go. Come on. Oh, that stayed in there.
[6823.39s -> 6829.74s]  That stuck around. All right, come on, come on, guy, guy, guy, guy. Remember what he said.
[6830.38s -> 6836.30s]  So this is the, this is the, I forgot everything. This is the mineral and then this is the quartz.
[6836.30s -> 6841.26s]  It's got smoky quartz in the center and then the water dissipated outside of the pores of the rock
[6841.82s -> 6849.66s]  and created, I gotta go back. I gotta get back. I gotta get back. I gotta figure out what else
[6849.66s -> 6856.86s]  is in here. I'm gonna get a legendary and he's not gonna be here. I'm gonna be like, okay,
[6858.30s -> 6866.22s]  enough stalling. Time to do the big one. Are we ready to try to do the big one?
[6867.10s -> 6878.61s]  Are you guys ready? Crack rock. Look at all these crack rock. It's not all crack.
[6880.27s -> 6884.03s]  This thing is, by the way, can we get a confirmed weight on this? It's 50 pounds.
[6884.91s -> 6890.06s]  This is 50 pounds. So whatever is in here,
[6894.00s -> 6897.60s]  it's, all right, it's already scored up here. I wonder, will the chain be big enough for this?
[6897.60s -> 6909.74s]  We can try. No, no, not at all. I think it is. Oh, we need a, we need one in person.
[6909.74s -> 6913.50s]  No, it's not long enough. Is it not long enough? No, we have to go the other way. All right.
[6917.65s -> 6930.83s]  God. I got the rock. You got the rock chain. Yeah. Come on. Come on. A little bit higher.
[6931.71s -> 6938.75s]  Should we try to get it a long way? It doesn't fit. The chain doesn't fit.
[6938.75s -> 6944.56s]  Maybe the, um, hold on. Can we do this? We could probably go like that. We can try. Like,
[6944.56s -> 6950.10s]  you know, like diagonal. Yeah, let's give it a shot. All right. So we go, I'll hold the rock.
[6951.15s -> 6968.43s]  So we go like this, maybe from like, can we get it like that? That may be tight enough.
[6968.43s -> 6976.54s]  No, it's not going to be tight enough. Well, it can be like a nuclear warhead.
[6977.66s -> 6982.62s]  If I hold it, can you get the chain? Actually, you know what? Here, try this. Okay. Let's go like
[6982.62s -> 6990.35s]  this. Hold the chain all the way out. Yep. Okay. Wrap it around. Okay. Okay. Is it around the whole
[6990.35s -> 6997.15s]  thing? What do you mean? Like if we go like this? Oh, uh huh. Can that make it? It's not even close.
[6997.15s -> 7006.14s]  Shit. Well, that's it. Streams up. No, I'm just kidding. Should we just hit it with a hammer?
[7008.22s -> 7014.77s]  Should we just smack this thing right? It's already scored right here. Sure. What do you think? Yeah,
[7015.49s -> 7018.61s]  should we go? Should we go horizontal or should we hit it with a hammer?
[7019.89s -> 7030.16s]  What do you guys think? Show auto. Why would auto be here? Chisel, chisel, just get the excavator.
[7032.72s -> 7039.28s]  I'm not going to break it. All right. Here we go. So I've been instructed. We got instructions.
[7040.56s -> 7046.45s]  So you're going to put this in the score. Okay. And then hit this with that and just smash it.
[7046.45s -> 7054.10s]  Smash it. Yeah. Tap it. Tap it. Are we ready to try this right in the score? Yeah. Just tap it.
[7054.10s -> 7075.95s]  Here we go. That's working. Yeah. Oh my goodness. Oh my God. Whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Wow. Look at
[7075.95s -> 7082.85s]  inside of there. Can you hold on? Let's go like this. He's more light. We got to turn it that way.
[7082.85s -> 7086.61s]  Turn toes here. Turn it this way. And then can you shoot this way, David? Shoot that way. Yeah.
[7087.41s -> 7101.38s]  I'm going to just carve it off. You got it? You got it? Yeah. Look at this one right here.
[7104.06s -> 7117.06s]  No blue, but still it's a rare. That's purple. That looks unbelievable. Oh my God. It's full.
[7117.06s -> 7125.94s]  It's like a Halloween candy bag full of these crystals. Honestly, this is like, hold on,
[7125.94s -> 7134.61s]  let me pick it up. I just ruined it. I picked it up and it broke in my hand. It was cool looking
[7134.61s -> 7149.17s]  and then I ruined it. Can you get it? This looks like the Mortal Kombat spike pit. Looks like a
[7149.17s -> 7154.78s]  shark's mouth. Yeah. It looks like a mouth. It really does look like a mouth. You're blocking
[7154.78s -> 7162.06s]  the light. Yeah. Just turn a little bit. I'm doing like limboing. There's a bee all right there.
[7162.06s -> 7167.52s]  Oh, it's a purple. They attracted it. They think it's a flower. Oh my God. All right.
[7169.17s -> 7177.14s]  Let me get one more look over here. This is the coolest thing ever. What do you guys think?
[7178.83s -> 7194.85s]  Pog rock. It looks like Jerma chomp. It does. It really does. I should have. All right. I'm
[7194.85s -> 7202.34s]  going to get it painted. This is going to get painted like Jerma chomp. That's so cool. That's
[7202.34s -> 7210.00s]  awesome. I'm going to hang this on my mantle. Well, this is a lot of fun. That was a ton of fun,
[7210.72s -> 7216.88s]  but that's really all we got planned. We opened up a shit load of geodes. We had
[7218.16s -> 7221.76s]  scientists come in and help us decipher what was going on. This is my favorite by far.
[7222.40s -> 7238.67s]  Look at this one. So cool. Awesome. I got treasures. I got cards. This stuff in this
[7238.67s -> 7245.18s]  treasure chest that I need to get like assessed. Some of these rocks need to get assessed. Yeah.
[7247.65s -> 7251.33s]  I'll see you guys later. That's the end of this stream. I'm going to go get some of this stuff
[7251.33s -> 7255.33s]  assessed. I got to see if I can make some money because look at all this.
[7256.21s -> 7263.01s]  I've got stuff in a chest. I've got geodes. I might make like $50,000 to $100,000 in the next
[7263.01s -> 7269.89s]  hour. Let's see if I can do it. Thank you for joining me. ScienceCenterNevada.org. Special thanks
[7269.89s -> 7274.61s]  to that team for coming out here and helping us do this. So awesome. I picked the wrong career
[7275.49s -> 7280.29s]  and I'll see you next time. Keep an eye on the stuff. I'm going to go get some shit assessed.
[7280.93s -> 7286.38s]  Have a wonderful rest of your day. I'm going to get the shovel.
[7287.02s -> 7319.09s]  Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello, sir. Welcome. How are you doing? Not too bad. What can I do for
[7319.09s -> 7325.09s]  you today? I'm doing fantastic. Thank you for asking. I have some trinkets here for you that
[7325.09s -> 7328.61s]  I would like to get assessed the value of. All right. That's what we do. That's what they do on
[7328.61s -> 7334.61s]  these programs. That is what we do here. They bring some cool stuff and we can make a deal,
[7334.61s -> 7338.85s]  right? I'll tell you what they're worth. Yeah. Tell me what you got here. Okay. So first of all,
[7339.25s -> 7342.85s]  you got to check out this guy right here. Okay. I don't know if that's potentially from the
[7342.85s -> 7349.49s]  Jurassic period or the Stegosaurus period. It's from some dinosaur period. Where did you come
[7349.49s -> 7355.33s]  across this piece? Digging in the ground. You found it yourself, huh? Yes. Digging in the ground.
[7355.33s -> 7359.57s]  Found it with a bunch of this other cool stuff. There's a story between. You don't need a story,
[7359.57s -> 7364.21s]  but that in particular is probably. Did you happen to notice that it was plastic at all?
[7365.36s -> 7375.74s]  No. Or that it said for pet use on it. But it feels kind of real. This is a completely
[7375.74s -> 7380.14s]  worthless piece. It's just a plastic bone. I ordered one for my dog yesterday. But don't
[7380.14s -> 7386.27s]  you have a guy? I'm not calling the guy for a plastic bone. Yeah, but you don't know that.
[7386.27s -> 7390.35s]  Do you have a plastic machine that you. It's all this is plastic. You don't know that that's what
[7390.35s -> 7396.30s]  that is. It's reflecting. Usually. I don't know if you've ever seen the TV shows, but usually you
[7396.30s -> 7401.82s]  call a guy. The guy comes in and looks at it and is like, oh, that's from the that's from Triceratops.
[7401.82s -> 7407.90s]  And then I you offer me $5000 for it. Well, let's let's find something worth calling.
[7407.90s -> 7412.98s]  OK, in that same room, look at these. These are rocks opened up like 30 of them.
[7412.98s -> 7418.42s]  Just at fresh openings. And how did you come across these ones in the ground to just in the
[7418.42s -> 7425.78s]  desert? Well, the the good news, these are some some beautiful geodes. So you did a great job
[7425.86s -> 7430.82s]  coming across these. The bad news is they're totally worthless. I'm not buying these.
[7430.82s -> 7434.02s]  People aren't coming into the shop looking for geodes. They just don't sell.
[7434.90s -> 7439.50s]  They don't. But OK, what about some of the big? We have a big one, too.
[7439.50s -> 7442.46s]  I'm not bringing that in here until you give me a price. They're rocks.
[7442.46s -> 7444.93s]  Yeah, but they're cool. They're really cool. They're awesome.
[7445.81s -> 7447.81s]  Maybe they make good gifts. You could try that.
[7447.81s -> 7451.89s]  It literally is no idea what it's talking about. I've seen stuff like this go for 500 bucks each.
[7453.06s -> 7455.30s]  You don't you're not going to take any of these even if I bring you the other ones.
[7455.38s -> 7457.70s]  I'm not interested in that. No, you don't want any of the rocks at all.
[7457.70s -> 7462.30s]  Not interested in rocks. What about the 90s snacks?
[7462.30s -> 7469.74s]  I've got we got Dunkaroos. I got these Kinder Joy stuff. This is old and they they make them. But
[7469.74s -> 7473.82s]  I got to say there's some there's some nostalgia here. I mean, I remember these snacks. These are
[7473.82s -> 7479.20s]  some these are some good snacks you got here. But something about snacks that that you dug up
[7479.20s -> 7483.20s]  just doesn't seem right. These these are also completely work.
[7491.26s -> 7497.42s]  A Blue Eyes White Dragon Yu-Gi-Oh original. This is I know this is worth at least something.
[7498.40s -> 7503.20s]  You have to have some kind of use for this. Let's take a look here. Is this has this been graded?
[7503.20s -> 7513.84s]  Yes, it's it's pounds per square inch 20. I'm not buying that. That's a lot. You're a liar.
[7513.84s -> 7517.76s]  You are a swindler and you're a liar. You know why? Because I looked this up before in the in
[7517.76s -> 7522.80s]  the garage when I was coming in here. This is worth at least $7.95 at least $10. I looked at
[7522.80s -> 7527.12s]  it before I got in here. Did it say you pay me? No, this is how much this card is worth at least
[7527.12s -> 7530.96s]  $10. I expect I expect you to take that for at least $15. I don't know what to tell you.
[7530.96s -> 7541.17s]  Because that was an insult that what you just did to me. Do you want the Tamagotchi?
[7542.05s -> 7545.97s]  Look at this. I haven't seen one of these. You're getting sleepy. I haven't seen one of these.
[7547.49s -> 7552.13s]  No, this stuff is not worthless. These look like little toys, sir. This stuff is not worth looking.
[7552.13s -> 7555.49s]  This stuff doesn't have any value. It didn't even hatch the egg. You don't even know what it could be
[7555.49s -> 7561.55s]  in there. It's random. Maybe you can come back after the egg hatches and it'll still be worthless.
[7561.55s -> 7567.55s]  What about these Stardew Valley seed packets? These what? Stardew Valley seed packets and
[7567.55s -> 7570.99s]  a Minecraft diamond. You know what Stardew Valley is, right? I don't speak French, sir.
[7572.56s -> 7579.22s]  You've never heard of Stardew Valley? I don't know any idea. Okay, what do you have? Let's take a
[7579.22s -> 7583.22s]  look at what you have here. We have some beautiful pieces here. Yeah, take a look. See if anything
[7583.22s -> 7587.62s]  strikes your fancy. You do have some pretty cool stuff actually. You got Elvis over here?
[7590.05s -> 7595.65s]  Oh, these coins too. All sorts of coins. Wow, this is actually really... What about this up here?
[7595.65s -> 7607.46s]  What's this? These are our newest arrival. Beautiful condition. We just checked through them
[7607.46s -> 7614.30s]  and take a look and see what you think. These are absolutely beautiful. They're heavy too. They
[7614.30s -> 7619.18s]  have a weight to them. That's how you can tell the value right there. Yeah, I knew that. That's why
[7619.18s -> 7624.99s]  I said that with you. Wow, these are... How much are these worth? These two pieces right now
[7626.27s -> 7633.86s]  we could probably let them go for 50,000. That's kind of on the high end. That would be quite a
[7633.86s -> 7638.74s]  steal on the high end, but it's okay. I did say that I wanted to invest in gold though. I did
[7638.74s -> 7645.23s]  mention that a long time ago. This would be a great way to get started. You think so? Absolutely.
[7645.23s -> 7652.27s]  Just hang on to these. Let them appreciate. They smell too. Is gold that was sent? Yes, it does.
[7652.59s -> 7659.70s]  That's the scent of gold right there. Holy smokes. You know what? I'm going to call my guy.
[7660.42s -> 7668.08s]  Come and get an assessment here. Over the phone. And it's my mom. It's like a pound.
[7670.32s -> 7681.54s]  Yeah, it looks good. He wouldn't... No, ma, he wouldn't take the Yu-Gi-Oh card.
[7683.09s -> 7694.26s]  I know it. I told him that. Okay, let me... 48? You think he'll take 48? Okay. All right. Yeah.
[7694.26s -> 7700.48s]  This guy's a moron. He has never even played Stardew Valley before. I know. Seriously. All right,
[7700.48s -> 7709.70s]  ma. All right. I love you too. Get ahold of your guy? That's very hard to reach my guy sometimes.
[7709.70s -> 7718.13s]  Did you say your mom? Is that right? Yeah. Well, she knows a lot. What did you say? Give me the
[7718.13s -> 7723.09s]  price again one more time. 50,000 for these pieces. Okay. Let me just want to make sure you
[7723.09s -> 7729.90s]  know I got it. Just so you know. Here it is. Just so you know I got it. I got it in my hand.
[7730.70s -> 7740.18s]  Well, okay. So this is the part where we do the thing. Can you do 38,000?
[7741.62s -> 7749.30s]  If we include all these items, I'd probably be willing to let it go for 49,999. 49,999. That's
[7751.06s -> 7757.63s]  5% off the first one you said? Something like that. Yeah. How about... Can you do...
[7758.51s -> 7767.68s]  Now that it's real, I'm really fucking nervous. Can you do 42,000? 44,000? 43,000?
[7769.22s -> 7776.42s]  I mean, these are great pieces. The best I could do would be probably 49,999.
[7776.42s -> 7783.70s]  You are. You are a tricky one. Deal. You got it. Deal. Let's make a deal.
[7784.34s -> 7790.56s]  I almost just yelled my mother's name. Here you go. You can count it too. You can make sure it's
[7790.56s -> 7795.92s]  all there. It's going to take a little while. Yeah. It's a step. You know what to do with it.
[7795.92s -> 7799.52s]  Yeah. Enjoy your new pieces, sir. Oh my God.
[7803.54s -> 7811.36s]  Yes. I'm going to... Should I turn it back to it? Wait. So I'm going to check the price of gold
[7811.36s -> 7822.67s]  right now. See if it went up. It went down? All right. Let's go. Whatever. You want to grab my phone?
[7822.67s -> 7833.90s]  Get out of my shop. Grab my phone. Thank you. You want to get Burger King? Don't use that part
[7833.90s -> 7861.98s]  because I don't want the people to know I ate it. I'm going to call my guy and I'm going to figure
[7861.98s -> 7867.42s]  out what the value that is because I'm going to get them in here and we'll make like they do on
[7867.42s -> 7872.46s]  the TV shows. Sounds good. I wanted you to do so badly. Just cut it right here. I wanted you so
[7872.46s -> 7876.38s]  badly to just call the guy in. It's good TV. I don't know why you don't understand that. I
[7876.38s -> 7881.34s]  would call the guy in if you had brought me these. You call the guy in for that. I don't
[7881.34s -> 7884.38s]  care what that is. The guy was just here. He's the one that evaluated these.
[7885.18s -> 7895.04s]  You just got to bring me something of value. Is he still in the parking lot? Give him that.
