[0.76s -> 10.36s]  So I'm sitting here questioning a couple things about the state of media and how, hear me out.
[10.36s -> 22.17s]  So why is it that I can play The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring on PlayStation 2
[22.17s -> 30.26s]  with a bunch of cutscenes and all the fucking music, but I can't watch The Fellowship of the
[30.26s -> 37.13s]  Ring on Twitch? Why am I not allowed to do that? Why can I play The Fellowship of the Ring the game,
[37.13s -> 40.25s]  but I can't watch The Fellowship of the Ring the movie? It's, I don't understand.
[41.05s -> 51.74s]  What happened to my fucking, my cord got all fucked up. Aren't they under the same boat? Is it
[51.74s -> 59.18s]  licensing? All right, but okay, but if Shadow of, Shadow of War came out like two years ago,
[63.77s -> 73.59s]  if I listen to The Hobbit's song in Shadow of War, but then I play a clip of The Hobbit's song
[75.46s -> 86.39s]  on YouTube, my channel gets, gets muted. That's weird. Like, is that, I don't understand.
[87.11s -> 97.53s]  Dermot, your audio is sounding nice and crisp today. Ha, well, look at you. We're playing Lord
[97.53s -> 101.13s]  of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring today because one person guaranteed I wouldn't get
[101.13s -> 112.31s]  past the first level. So, that's what we're doing. I don't know why you would say that because I,
[113.75s -> 122.50s]  weirdly enough, my memory does not remember this one. Yeah, there it is. Lord of the Rings,
[122.50s -> 125.86s]  you won't make it. Here we go. Just for, just for context, for those of you that are curious,
[125.86s -> 133.02s]  here's the context here. You won't get past the first part of Fellowship, I guarantee it.
[134.22s -> 139.13s]  All right, I wouldn't, all right, I wouldn't remember your name because when I get past
[139.13s -> 144.66s]  level one in Fellowship of the Ring, I'm going to fucking scream your name. Right. What was
[144.66s -> 150.50s]  the name? Fake what? Here comes another hype train. Wait, I, I like made, I made this harder
[150.50s -> 156.02s]  to do. I increased it. All right. Well, here we go. Here we go again. When I get, when I'm done.
[157.62s -> 163.62s]  Fake. All right. Fake, fake. Here comes the hype train. When I am done with. Uh,
[165.37s -> 174.26s]  thanks for the hype train, guys. All right. Free, free hype trains in three days. This is like,
[174.26s -> 180.25s]  all right. When you, when you go to, when you, when you ride a ride at Disney World,
[180.97s -> 185.85s]  right? When you get on the hype train and you ride, you ride the fucking new Star Wars ride.
[185.85s -> 193.11s]  And it's like, holy shit, that was hype. That was insane. That was incredible. Oh, oh my God,
[193.11s -> 198.55s]  when Han Solo like flew by, dude, I shit my pants. Let's do it again. And you ride it again.
[199.90s -> 204.94s]  On the third or fourth ride on the hype train, on the hype ride, you look up and you start to see
[204.94s -> 211.48s]  where the fucking mechanical shit is. I, oh, wait. Oh, there's Han Solo. I can see the wire.
[211.48s -> 222.79s]  I can see the wire up there and it's connected to an arm. Oh, hi. Fuck. We're getting, there's
[222.79s -> 231.37s]  too many hype trains. All right. This is fucking ridiculous. Rusty bars. Oh no. Wait, hold on a
[231.37s -> 237.69s]  minute. Is there, is there a scratch on that LCD screen? Yeah. I didn't notice that on the first
[237.69s -> 247.93s]  fucking hype. Ah, Gary, should we have rode this ride 10 times in a row? Where are your kids?
[250.74s -> 265.72s]  Level three complete already. Level three. Here comes level four. Get on the hype train. Never
[265.72s -> 273.03s]  get off. Never get off the hype train. Already level four. You guys are not fucking around today.
[273.03s -> 279.11s]  We're just doing it. But okay. That's my point with this whole thing is I got to tweak some
[279.11s -> 283.75s]  numbers on this because I don't want to ride the Han Solo ride 20 times in a row and every day
[284.31s -> 290.97s]  I'm just sitting there. Get hype for the hype train. There's Han Solo. There he goes. Yeah.
[292.31s -> 300.38s]  Get hype. Oh, fuck. You've given me so much money in four days. I don't want it to be like
[300.38s -> 304.30s]  just going through the motions thing for me. I'm going to tweak the numbers. I'm going to make it
[304.30s -> 310.01s]  harder to do. We'll see. I thought I already did that, but you guys are fucking, you guys are so
[310.01s -> 316.42s]  generous. Like even if I keep making this harder to do, you're probably still going to do it.
[317.83s -> 332.26s]  You're still going to do it. Get hype or else. Oh man. Thanks guys. Seriously. This is fucking
[332.26s -> 343.10s]  too much. There's a lot of the rings. All right. You did it. Hype. You did it. Hype. Hype. Hype.
[343.10s -> 354.66s]  Hype. Hype. Hype. Thank you guys. Seriously. Level four. Oh, dude. There's only five minutes
[354.66s -> 367.10s]  to get this train out of the station. Dude. Four minutes and 30 seconds remain. What the?
[368.90s -> 392.10s]  Let's go. Start it. Do it. 27%, 28%. Come on, man. We can do this. We can do this three days in a
[392.10s -> 407.77s]  row. That's going to get my VOD muted. This is, okay, this is mute the VOD day. We got Lord of
[407.77s -> 412.01s]  the Rings music, Lord of the Rings fellowship of the ring in the background. We've got a hype train
[412.01s -> 416.25s]  getting on the ride again and it's going to complete and it's going to keep going.
[416.25s -> 421.29s]  We like to party. We like to party more. I can't even fucking keep up, man. This is insane.
[423.37s -> 432.65s]  Oh my fucking God. Get out of that hype train. Hey, Eleanor, $50. I like this video game. Thanks
[432.65s -> 456.25s]  for the 5,000 bits. Thanks for completing the hype train. Should I just play the song?
[457.05s -> 462.57s]  Should I just play this song and that's it? And that's what we do. And we just ride the hype
[462.57s -> 473.11s]  train and then we get off. It's too loud. All right. Hold on. Let me just be very, very... Did
[473.11s -> 483.74s]  somebody say that the Venga Boys was too loud? The Venga Boys are only allowed to be played at an
[483.74s -> 493.19s]  audio level of at least seven out of 10. If you play the Venga Boys under a five out of 10 in volume,
[493.19s -> 505.19s]  your computer explodes. It's like Speed, the movie with Keanu Reeves. A hundred dB.
[505.19s -> 513.00s]  Anyways, we did it. You did it again. You did it again. You did it again. You fucking... You blew
[513.00s -> 519.32s]  through another like three, five hundred subs or whatever it was. What is it? Let's just see
[519.32s -> 528.97s]  what it completes. It tells us. Play the song. You're getting the song. Actually, this is kind
[528.97s -> 537.70s]  of the royalty-free version of fellowship of the ring, isn't it? It is. This is not really fellowship
[537.70s -> 546.66s]  of the ring. So now I understand why I can play it. Where's Jon Snow? Wrong franchise. You're
[546.66s -> 562.60s]  thinking of a game of thrones. Where's Jon Snow? Toss a coin to the streamer. Oh my fucking God.
[567.10s -> 577.85s]  Another 5,000 bits from numb legs. They say hype in all capitals. Fucking... I'm making that
[577.85s -> 587.13s]  goddamn movie. I'm making that movie. Here's the part about this though. The projects that
[587.13s -> 597.08s]  are in the pipeline now became... I just fed all of my Pokemon that magic fruit that makes them
[597.08s -> 602.36s]  all stronger. I've got like 10 Pokemon in my Pokedex thing and I just gave them all the magic
[602.36s -> 606.76s]  fruit that makes them like 20% stronger, whatever it is. What's it called? Rare Candy. That's right.
[607.99s -> 612.31s]  You guys just gave Rare Candy to the four projects that are coming up in the next three,
[612.31s -> 626.36s]  four months. There it is. You achieved a hype level of level five. You did it. Let's get the
[626.36s -> 638.10s]  Vanga Boys on here to show just how fucking hype that was. 129 subs, 23,000 bits. Jesus Christ,
[638.10s -> 649.51s]  guys. In the first 10 minutes of the stream. You guys are too much. Thanks for sprinkling
[649.51s -> 655.35s]  Rare Candy all over all my fucking Pokemon videos that are coming out. Or streams, you know.
[659.40s -> 666.28s]  Anyway, let's play Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring. We'll go over all those at the end
[666.28s -> 674.78s]  of the stream like we always do, but holy shit. Hype is over. Back to sleep. New game. Lord of
[674.78s -> 685.56s]  the Rings. Okay, I was gonna say hopefully it doesn't hang. He's playing a game. Wake me up,
[685.56s -> 692.20s]  but he's not. We're gonna get a cutscene I think here. Is it the actors? Is it the original actors?
[692.76s -> 716.87s]  We'll find out. Hello? It's the old PlayStation 2 buzzing sound. Here we go.
[716.87s -> 721.48s]  That's the Harry Potter memory thing.
[725.86s -> 732.73s]  In the shadows of Morgdor, the Dark Lord Sauron forged the one ring to enslave all elves,
[732.73s -> 740.23s]  dwarves, and men of Middle-earth. The three people of Middle-earth overthrew Sauron,
[740.23s -> 752.01s]  but lost the ring. Now the enemy has returned, and from his dark tower in Morgdor,
[752.01s -> 758.81s]  he seeks his ring. We must find the ring first and destroy it. Who is that supposed to be?
[761.03s -> 762.95s]  Don't- I should know this.
[770.44s -> 783.21s]  Dendril? Dendril? Gabriel? No, not Gabriel. Gala- Gala- Gala-Leo. I don't know that- I don't
[783.21s -> 789.85s]  know. I'm such a fucking shitty fan. I don't know her name. Not Gandalf. Why are there no subtitles?
[795.37s -> 802.34s]  Gala-Dreel. Welcome back, Gandalf. Will we have fireworks, elvish lessons,
[802.34s -> 806.74s]  tales of ancient Numenor? Today, we must talk about a shadow of the past.
[807.46s -> 811.78s]  The ring you inherited may be very dangerous. Is that Ian Kellan? Uncle Bilbo's magic ring?
[812.42s -> 820.02s]  Magic rings, as you call them, were made by elves. But this ring, I think, was made by another.
[820.82s -> 827.91s]  Give me the ring. That looks like the Christian Bible game show host.
[829.45s -> 833.53s]  See, Frodo, it was that easy. You just gotta toss it into some fire.
[834.89s -> 843.93s]  Let me save you 16 hours worth of movie. I see fine lines, lines of fire, in a flowing script.
[844.89s -> 851.61s]  What does it say? One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all,
[852.49s -> 858.49s]  and in the darkness, bind them. This is the one ring to rule them all.
[859.21s -> 865.77s]  The ancient kings of elves, dwarves, and men use the rings of power to rule their lands.
[865.77s -> 868.01s]  See, I don't have to pay attention to this cutscene, because I already, like,
[868.01s -> 873.29s]  know this. Oh, dude, pay attention to the cutscene. Everyone's seen this movie.
[873.29s -> 878.26s]  A strange creature called Gollum found the ring and was corrupted by it.
[878.26s -> 885.22s]  Bilbo won it from Gollum, and now it is yours. But the lord of the rings has returned,
[885.22s -> 887.78s]  and all his thought is bent on finding the ring.
[888.90s -> 896.02s]  Let's destroy it. It can only be destroyed when it was forged, in Mount Doom, the fire mountain in
[896.02s -> 904.10s]  Lorda. Take it there, take it. No, do not tempt me. If I bore the ring, I would become the Dark Lord
[904.10s -> 908.34s]  Gandalf. It's not like a piece of chocolate while you're on a diet.
[913.54s -> 920.36s]  I'm a danger to the Shire. I must leave. I could set out on the road just like Bilbo.
[921.18s -> 927.82s]  My dear Frodo, hobbits really are amazing creatures. But you need not go alone. If there
[927.82s -> 933.34s]  are any you can trust. But take care. The enemy has many spies.
[934.38s -> 939.11s]  Uh-oh. What was in the window? I didn't look in the window. Did you look in the window?
[940.84s -> 945.56s]  What? Well then. Samwise Gamgee, isn't it?
[946.52s -> 950.17s]  Don't hurt me. What are you doing at Bag End?
[951.21s -> 954.65s]  Nothing, sir. Trimming the grass under the window.
[954.65s -> 958.17s]  Oh? The sound of Shire stopped some time ago.
[958.17s -> 962.33s]  Bootleg Lord of the Rings. We're just watching the Lord of the Rings on stream.
[962.33s -> 965.45s]  Finally. I get to live my fucking fantasy.
[966.09s -> 973.16s]  What have you heard? Oh, Frodo, don't let him turn me into anything unnatural.
[973.16s -> 975.40s]  He won't hurt you. Just answer his question.
[976.20s -> 981.88s]  Well, I heard a lot. I didn't understand about lords and rings in the fiery mountain.
[982.44s -> 986.36s]  And elves, sir. I had to listen. I dearly love to see elves.
[988.26s -> 990.10s]  Were they? Keep it a secret, Sam.
[990.58s -> 992.90s]  Or I hope Gandalf turned you into a spotted toad.
[993.46s -> 994.98s]  I've thought of something better.
[994.98s -> 995.94s]  Why don't they shave their feet?
[995.94s -> 997.78s]  You will go away with you, Frodo.
[998.50s -> 999.78s]  Me, sir? I don't understand.
[999.78s -> 1002.66s]  Go and see elves and all. Hooray!
[1002.66s -> 1003.70s]  But where should we go?
[1004.58s -> 1007.06s]  Towards danger, but not too rashly.
[1007.06s -> 1008.98s]  Just grab like a wax strip and just-
[1010.98s -> 1013.14s]  Take time to settle your affairs before you leave.
[1013.94s -> 1015.86s]  I could leave in autumn, on my birthday.
[1016.42s -> 1017.62s]  Very well, but no later.
[1017.62s -> 1019.78s]  How come there wasn't like a 40-year-old virgin
[1020.98s -> 1025.86s]  part of these movies where Frodo gets like his feet waxed and he's like,
[1025.86s -> 1027.78s]  Oh, I'm killing Ornstein!
[1027.78s -> 1028.82s]  Every time they rip it off.
[1028.82s -> 1030.10s]  I'll have to sell Bag End.
[1030.66s -> 1034.10s]  The Sackville Bagginses have been trying to take over this place for years.
[1034.66s -> 1035.94s]  A shame to let them have it.
[1037.14s -> 1041.86s]  Indeed. And now I must go. I have much to attend to.
[1042.58s -> 1043.22s]  As do I.
[1043.22s -> 1044.66s]  That would ruin these fucking movies.
[1045.62s -> 1047.22s]  That would ruin everything.
[1048.18s -> 1051.86s]  They would not get nominated for any Academy Awards across the entire three movies.
[1051.86s -> 1055.94s]  Oh, yes. Not a word from Sam Gamgee, and that's for certain.
[1055.94s -> 1058.58s]  Once you leave, travel as Mr. Underhill.
[1058.58s -> 1061.94s]  The name of Baggins is not synced outside the Shire.
[1061.94s -> 1068.34s]  And do not use the ring, for it can corrupt the most innocent heart.
[1068.90s -> 1069.70s]  I understand.
[1070.26s -> 1071.78s]  Gandalf, how do you use a ring?
[1071.78s -> 1075.43s]  You just paused on it.
[1075.43s -> 1076.71s]  I'm going to see elves.
[1076.71s -> 1080.31s]  Farewell, Frodo. I'll return by your birthday.
[1081.43s -> 1083.11s]  Oh, my birthday?
[1083.11s -> 1085.51s]  I'm going to get Gandalfs coming to my birthday party.
[1085.51s -> 1087.83s]  As the nights grew longer, I decided I might have to leave the house.
[1087.83s -> 1090.15s]  You're not coming to your birthday party.
[1090.15s -> 1091.67s]  On the morning of my birthday, September 22nd,
[1091.67s -> 1094.63s]  I set out for one final stroll around the Shire.
[1094.63s -> 1101.43s]  I had to say farewell to my neighbors and sell my home to the Bees Sackville Baggins.
[1101.43s -> 1102.31s]  Scroll back up. What?
[1103.99s -> 1107.11s]  He's coming to my birthday. That's my birthday.
[1107.11s -> 1119.62s]  Gandalf, just come to my fucking birthday party.
[1120.18s -> 1120.74s]  Not yours.
[1123.27s -> 1129.85s]  He could be making it up, though.
[1132.07s -> 1132.71s]  All right, let's go.
[1133.90s -> 1136.62s]  Happy birthday. Gandalf's coming to my birthday party.
[1137.66s -> 1138.62s]  Oh, I have to get ready.
[1139.18s -> 1150.42s]  You picked a Bag End key. Get the key to Bag End.
[1150.42s -> 1152.74s]  Press and hold R2 to view Frodo's inventory.
[1153.62s -> 1156.34s]  Use the left analog stick to scroll through Frodo's inventory.
[1157.94s -> 1158.58s]  Walking stick.
[1159.54s -> 1162.82s]  Oh, you can punch and you can hit.
[1163.46s -> 1174.26s]  All right, so I got the key to Bag End.
[1174.82s -> 1175.62s]  Anything else I need to do?
[1182.39s -> 1184.15s]  Stick in Bag End.
[1188.25s -> 1188.65s]  Shut up.
[1190.17s -> 1191.88s]  All right, let's go. I got the key.
[1192.76s -> 1197.59s]  Wait, I don't want to miss any secrets.
[1198.39s -> 1203.27s]  Hey, by the way, what qualifies as the first part of Lord of the Rings?
[1203.99s -> 1204.79s]  Fellowship of the Ring.
[1208.07s -> 1208.95s]  Getting out of the house here.
[1208.95s -> 1210.79s]  This is the first level is getting out of the house.
[1224.20s -> 1226.04s]  Find the deed to Bag End before leaving.
[1226.04s -> 1226.60s]  Oh, shit.
[1228.95s -> 1229.59s]  Is there a sprint?
[1235.45s -> 1236.65s]  Fucking ugly ass game.
[1247.94s -> 1249.86s]  Yes, I know it is PlayStation 2.
[1249.86s -> 1250.18s]  I know.
[1250.98s -> 1252.90s]  But it's pretty ugly.
[1252.90s -> 1253.70s]  He's gonna quit it.
[1254.34s -> 1255.82s]  He's gonna quit.
[1255.82s -> 1256.78s]  Oh, no.
[1256.78s -> 1258.14s]  No, I'm not gonna quit.
[1258.14s -> 1258.54s]  I can't.
[1259.18s -> 1261.13s]  Bring us in this chest.
[1261.69s -> 1263.29s]  I best leave it here until I sell Bag End.
[1263.29s -> 1264.41s]  He sells his house?
[1268.41s -> 1268.97s]  I don't...
[1268.97s -> 1269.85s]  Wait, hold on.
[1269.85s -> 1272.89s]  Frodo sells his house in Fellowship of the Ring?
[1273.69s -> 1276.57s]  Where's the deed to the house?
[1277.29s -> 1280.01s]  You never watched the movie.
[1280.01s -> 1280.57s]  Yes, I did.
[1280.57s -> 1283.29s]  I don't remember them being on a house sale.
[1284.25s -> 1288.34s]  You didn't read the books.
[1289.06s -> 1291.32s]  No, I didn't read the books.
[1292.92s -> 1293.24s]  Because...
[1293.88s -> 1299.70s]  Where's his deed?
[1300.34s -> 1306.97s]  The movies were so good that I couldn't read the books.
[1306.97s -> 1307.53s]  Okay?
[1307.53s -> 1308.33s]  I'll be...
[1308.33s -> 1308.89s]  I'm gonna be honest.
[1309.69s -> 1311.69s]  The movies were too good.
[1312.65s -> 1314.89s]  So I could not read the books.
[1315.61s -> 1326.36s]  Hold on a second.
[1326.36s -> 1327.48s]  Let me just do something here.
[1332.92s -> 1335.00s]  I think I can turn the brightness up a little bit or something.
[1335.00s -> 1335.72s]  Something's wrong.
[1336.68s -> 1339.40s]  It looks like shitty, crusty.
[1339.40s -> 1340.60s]  I think that just might be the game.
[1340.60s -> 1341.72s]  Let me see if I can tweak this.
[1352.97s -> 1353.77s]  I'm not cheating.
[1355.83s -> 1356.47s]  All right, here we go.
[1357.11s -> 1361.29s]  Is that better or worse?
[1361.29s -> 1362.01s]  I can't even tell.
[1362.01s -> 1362.81s]  That's like worse.
[1363.53s -> 1365.42s]  Wait, oh, there we go.
[1365.98s -> 1371.37s]  That's a little better.
[1371.37s -> 1381.61s]  Is it worse?
[1381.61s -> 1387.13s]  Do we saturate the colors a little more?
[1388.46s -> 1389.90s]  All right, now we're looking okay.
[1392.78s -> 1394.30s]  Now it doesn't look like total dog shit.
[1394.86s -> 1400.55s]  Have you dropped the contrast a little?
[1401.19s -> 1403.08s]  Put the gamut down.
[1405.30s -> 1407.14s]  Gamut down, sharpness up, brightness up.
[1408.10s -> 1410.94s]  I don't have access to those.
[1411.50s -> 1414.55s]  That looks better.
[1414.55s -> 1415.43s]  That looks all right right there.
[1423.02s -> 1424.06s]  Looks like I put the ring on.
[1426.44s -> 1428.52s]  All right, let me walk around for a second.
[1430.10s -> 1432.10s]  Oh yeah, that's like a thousand times better.
[1432.82s -> 1435.74s]  Before it was like I hurt my head.
[1436.54s -> 1437.42s]  That's so much better.
[1437.98s -> 1446.26s]  All right, let's close this back down.
[1447.38s -> 1449.94s]  Am I playing this in a bathtub?
[1451.67s -> 1452.17s]  Yes.
[1452.95s -> 1454.87s]  Yes, I'm in a bathtub right now.
[1454.95s -> 1456.31s]  I'm playing in a bathtub.
[1456.31s -> 1457.19s]  I bathe and play.
[1457.75s -> 1458.63s]  That's how I game.
[1458.63s -> 1462.31s]  That's how you know that I take it dead seriously.
[1462.31s -> 1463.67s]  Oh, oh, by the question.
[1464.97s -> 1467.29s]  I was scared to do this and I didn't know.
[1468.36s -> 1469.24s]  Okay, let me ask.
[1469.24s -> 1470.12s]  This is a real question.
[1470.76s -> 1472.52s]  Because how does electricity even work?
[1473.32s -> 1477.48s]  So if I bring, let's say for instance,
[1477.48s -> 1478.68s]  if somebody was to hypothetically,
[1481.00s -> 1482.92s]  if you would like to be in a bathtub, right?
[1482.92s -> 1484.76s]  Like if you're taking a bath and you want to,
[1484.76s -> 1486.84s]  oh, I have like my phone with me
[1486.84s -> 1488.44s]  or my iPad, right?
[1490.10s -> 1492.58s]  If you have your iPad in the bath,
[1492.58s -> 1494.82s]  if you drop the iPad into the bathtub,
[1495.46s -> 1496.74s]  is it going to electrocute you?
[1502.09s -> 1502.59s]  No, right?
[1506.06s -> 1507.98s]  No, because there's no current.
[1508.62s -> 1514.25s]  That's, there has to be a current.
[1514.25s -> 1517.98s]  Yeah, because there's no like current to let go.
[1519.16s -> 1519.64s]  Yeah, okay.
[1520.20s -> 1520.84s]  Oh, that's correct.
[1520.84s -> 1525.90s]  Yeah, because I was taking a bath and I was like,
[1525.90s -> 1526.86s]  I want to use my iPad.
[1526.86s -> 1529.98s]  But if I like slip and drop the iPad into the bath,
[1529.98s -> 1532.14s]  am I going to get like fucking killed?
[1533.02s -> 1533.74s]  I was scared.
[1538.81s -> 1542.70s]  The amperage is too low.
[1544.23s -> 1544.71s]  I don't know.
[1544.71s -> 1546.55s]  It's like, okay, what if you dropped it?
[1546.55s -> 1550.07s]  Listen, what if, okay, an iPad won't do it.
[1550.07s -> 1554.79s]  But what if you had like a big fucking like Alienware laptop
[1554.79s -> 1556.55s]  that has like an i7 in it?
[1557.19s -> 1558.87s]  And it's like a $3,000 laptop.
[1558.87s -> 1560.31s]  If you dropped it into the bathtub,
[1562.17s -> 1563.53s]  would that still do it?
[1563.53s -> 1564.03s]  No.
[1575.29s -> 1575.79s]  Okay.
[1579.38s -> 1581.16s]  Where's this deed?
[1581.16s -> 1583.32s]  Where's this deed so I can tell this person
[1583.32s -> 1584.20s]  that I beat the first part?
[1584.20s -> 1585.80s]  All right, I'm going to check every fucking room.
[1587.93s -> 1589.29s]  We're at the end of the hallway.
[1590.47s -> 1590.97s]  This way.
[1592.18s -> 1593.06s]  Okay, is it in here?
[1594.20s -> 1595.00s]  In the dining room.
[1600.31s -> 1601.27s]  Not in the dining room.
[1601.99s -> 1603.19s]  Nothing sparkly to look at.
[1613.70s -> 1614.90s]  There's nothing in here.
[1614.90s -> 1615.40s]  Okay.
[1616.26s -> 1616.82s]  Next room.
[1617.78s -> 1618.58s]  This one right here.
[1620.90s -> 1621.40s]  No deed.
[1623.66s -> 1624.46s]  No deed.
[1624.46s -> 1625.34s]  Okay, found the deed.
[1625.98s -> 1628.98s]  Complete.
[1628.98s -> 1629.48s]  I got it.
[1630.97s -> 1633.05s]  Hey, hey, fake Grumbo, if you're here.
[1633.05s -> 1635.21s]  I'm about to fucking yell your name really loud.
[1636.01s -> 1648.86s]  I actually can't get out of the house.
[1655.69s -> 1657.30s]  Hey, I beat the first.
[1657.30s -> 1658.50s]  This is not the first level, never mind.
[1663.19s -> 1666.39s]  Imagine dropping a whole laptop in the bath.
[1666.95s -> 1667.67s]  What's with the flame?
[1667.67s -> 1669.59s]  There's like weird scan lines right now.
[1670.15s -> 1670.65s]  Do you see that?
[1678.28s -> 1679.24s]  The Shire.
[1679.24s -> 1680.76s]  Press triangle to talk to others.
[1681.40s -> 1684.28s]  Good morning to you, Mr. Frodo.
[1684.28s -> 1685.72s]  Good morning, Sam.
[1685.72s -> 1687.48s]  All ready to set out for Buckland?
[1687.48s -> 1688.28s]  Already?
[1688.28s -> 1690.44s]  Or will be as soon as I tend to Bag End.
[1690.44s -> 1693.24s]  Lobelia Sackville Baggins is buying the place.
[1693.24s -> 1695.72s]  You don't need to weed Bag End ever again.
[1695.72s -> 1699.08s]  I'd like to weed them Sackville Bagginses out of Bag End.
[1699.08s -> 1700.12s]  If you get my meaning.
[1700.12s -> 1700.62s]  What?
[1701.24s -> 1704.60s]  Bag End has the best garden in the Shire, thanks to your work.
[1704.60s -> 1707.64s]  Oh, no, I'm sure there are many finer.
[1707.64s -> 1709.08s]  This game is dated as fuck.
[1709.08s -> 1714.92s]  Mary Brandybuck said he was meeting Pippin Took at the Green Dragon and invited you to join.
[1714.92s -> 1717.48s]  They took a long walk out here just for a drink.
[1717.48s -> 1719.64s]  This game sucks, actually, is what you-
[1719.64s -> 1720.92s]  Begging your pardon, sir.
[1720.92s -> 1723.56s]  But there's little mischief to be found in the Green Dragon.
[1723.56s -> 1725.00s]  The Keeper won't stand for it.
[1725.00s -> 1725.64s]  We will see.
[1726.60s -> 1727.80s]  Wait, but hold on a minute.
[1727.80s -> 1728.30s]  I'm-
[1729.16s -> 1733.38s]  What a pretty bird.
[1736.38s -> 1736.88s]  What?
[1737.83s -> 1740.47s]  The two towers is like one of the best games ever made.
[1740.47s -> 1741.03s]  What happened?
[1741.67s -> 1748.22s]  I'll be here when these pumpkins get turned into pies.
[1748.78s -> 1749.90s]  More's the pity.
[1749.90s -> 1750.78s]  I hate this camera.
[1750.78s -> 1751.58s]  It's so stupid.
[1752.38s -> 1757.70s]  Okay, let's keep going.
[1760.58s -> 1764.76s]  Number three, Bag Shot Row.
[1764.76s -> 1765.88s]  Home of the Ganges.
[1766.68s -> 1767.96s]  We'll send this hit as much-
[1767.96s -> 1769.24s]  No, I can't.
[1769.24s -> 1770.44s]  I can't, I can't.
[1770.44s -> 1771.24s]  I'm not stopping.
[1774.44s -> 1774.92s]  Mushroom.
[1774.92s -> 1777.16s]  Frodo can eat mushrooms to restore his health.
[1781.45s -> 1784.60s]  Okay.
[1784.60s -> 1785.16s]  Hi, Milo.
[1785.16s -> 1786.52s]  Hello, Frodo.
[1786.52s -> 1788.12s]  Seen any elves lately?
[1788.12s -> 1790.28s]  I'm afraid not, I'm sorry to say.
[1790.28s -> 1791.56s]  What about trolls?
[1791.56s -> 1792.84s]  No trolls either.
[1792.84s -> 1793.56s]  Good.
[1793.56s -> 1795.88s]  It's about time you found your hobbit sense again.
[1796.44s -> 1799.72s]  You know, some say you're as mad as your uncle.
[1799.72s -> 1800.04s]  Carrying on with an old wizard-
[1800.04s -> 1801.40s]  And to complete the first mission.
[1801.40s -> 1802.20s]  I know, that's the-
[1802.20s -> 1803.08s]  I'm gonna-
[1803.08s -> 1805.88s]  Well, at least they have something interesting to talk about then.
[1805.88s -> 1806.36s]  Good day.
[1807.00s -> 1813.72s]  Somebody fucking guaranteed that I wouldn't do the first level.
[1813.72s -> 1815.00s]  They guaranteed it.
[1815.00s -> 1816.36s]  I can't let that person win.
[1821.30s -> 1821.78s]  Where do I go?
[1821.78s -> 1823.14s]  I gotta go find Marion Pippin.
[1823.70s -> 1829.24s]  What is it?
[1829.24s -> 1830.20s]  By the garden or something?
[1833.27s -> 1835.11s]  Howlfast Hornblower, number six.
[1835.91s -> 1843.00s]  These people's names are out here?
[1849.72s -> 1851.40s]  You probably should have let them win.
[1853.37s -> 1853.61s]  No.
[1854.57s -> 1862.46s]  Is there a game here?
[1863.18s -> 1864.78s]  Or do I just have to play as a hobbit?
[1865.66s -> 1867.58s]  Don't we traverse mountains and shit?
[1868.70s -> 1870.54s]  Isn't that like big battle sequences?
[1870.54s -> 1871.82s]  What happened in the first movie?
[1872.54s -> 1883.48s]  Right, hold on, here we go.
[1883.48s -> 1888.73s]  Hello, Ted.
[1888.73s -> 1890.41s]  I wanted to say goodbye before I-
[1890.41s -> 1892.17s]  Can't you see I'm busy?
[1892.17s -> 1892.97s]  Actually, no.
[1892.97s -> 1894.89s]  You seem to be just standing about.
[1894.89s -> 1896.89s]  Well, if you knew about mills,
[1896.89s -> 1899.69s]  you'd know I'm trying to locate a very important metal pin
[1899.69s -> 1901.61s]  that must have fallen out of my mill wheel.
[1901.61s -> 1903.13s]  Is that why the mill isn't working?
[1903.21s -> 1903.53s]  I have to-
[1903.53s -> 1906.89s]  Oh, never you mind about working or not working.
[1906.89s -> 1909.61s]  I've sent Mugwort to Brie for a replacement.
[1909.61s -> 1910.49s]  I thought I-
[1910.49s -> 1912.97s]  Wait, I have to go get-
[1912.97s -> 1914.49s]  If I haven't found it yet,
[1914.49s -> 1916.65s]  there's no way you can find it.
[1916.65s -> 1918.09s]  Metal pin next to the-
[1918.09s -> 1919.77s]  It looks like a plain metal pin.
[1920.57s -> 1921.37s]  Now, good day to you.
[1926.62s -> 1927.42s]  Holy shit.
[1931.64s -> 1935.48s]  Imagine having a movie that was made with like 150 to what?
[1935.48s -> 1936.68s]  200 million dollars.
[1938.20s -> 1941.80s]  And your tie-in video game for one of the most celebrated franchises
[1941.80s -> 1945.80s]  ever in the history of human cinema and human literature
[1946.68s -> 1948.92s]  is find the pin to the fucking watermill.
[1956.92s -> 1957.80s]  All right, where's that mill?
[1958.68s -> 1961.96s]  This isn't based on the movie.
[1962.60s -> 1971.45s]  It's not?
[1974.73s -> 1975.21s]  Yes, it is.
[1975.85s -> 1980.09s]  Official game based on the literary works of J.R.R. Tolkien.
[1980.65s -> 1983.53s]  I call bullshit on that because look at the costumes.
[1984.82s -> 1985.54s]  This is the same-
[1985.54s -> 1988.98s]  Like, this is Peter Jackson costume design and-
[1988.98s -> 1989.30s]  What?
[1989.94s -> 1996.86s]  Like, Peter Jackson designed this cape.
[1997.50s -> 1999.29s]  What do you mean?
[1999.29s -> 2000.01s]  No, it's not.
[2000.01s -> 2001.77s]  That's Ian McKellen's Gandalf.
[2009.35s -> 2009.75s]  No.
[2009.75s -> 2009.99s]  What?
[2009.99s -> 2011.59s]  The costumes are described in the books.
[2012.55s -> 2013.43s]  No, I'm telling you.
[2013.43s -> 2014.07s]  We're gonna get-
[2014.07s -> 2014.79s]  I'm telling you, though.
[2014.79s -> 2016.23s]  This is based on the fucking movie.
[2017.19s -> 2019.78s]  This-
[2021.58s -> 2022.06s]  Bullshit.
[2023.80s -> 2026.28s]  Fellowship of the Ring.
[2026.28s -> 2027.00s]  When did it come out?
[2028.66s -> 2028.98s]  What?
[2028.98s -> 2030.82s]  You just magically decided to-
[2030.82s -> 2036.10s]  Oh, you just magically, less than six months later after the movie comes out,
[2036.10s -> 2040.42s]  you decide we're gonna make a game based on the literary works of the Fellowship of the Ring
[2040.42s -> 2042.98s]  four and a half months after the fucking movie comes out.
[2043.54s -> 2043.94s]  Bullshit.
[2044.98s -> 2058.10s]  You can't develop a game in six months.
[2058.10s -> 2059.94s]  All right, one guy's not winning.
[2060.66s -> 2061.99s]  I'm going to do this right now.
[2064.25s -> 2066.65s]  Peter Jackson based the film on this game.
[2071.90s -> 2072.30s]  I have to-
[2072.30s -> 2073.34s]  All right, let's go.
[2073.34s -> 2073.98s]  Come on.
[2073.98s -> 2075.50s]  I have to get to the first level.
[2075.50s -> 2076.38s]  Nope, nope, nope, nope.
[2076.38s -> 2076.88s]  I refuse.
[2078.92s -> 2082.44s]  This is why they said it.
[2082.44s -> 2084.28s]  It had nothing to do with the game being hard.
[2086.20s -> 2086.60s]  Fuck.
[2086.60s -> 2087.48s]  I thought it was like,
[2087.48s -> 2088.76s]  dude, the game's too hard for you.
[2088.76s -> 2090.36s]  Like, the combo meter, you're gonna fuck it up.
[2090.36s -> 2091.88s]  Like, that's in the second and third game.
[2093.48s -> 2094.20s]  I get it now.
[2094.20s -> 2095.08s]  Now I know why he said that.
[2109.88s -> 2111.72s]  I just skipped dialogue in the first-
[2111.72s -> 2112.92s]  All right, let's go.
[2112.92s -> 2113.40s]  Get high.
[2115.72s -> 2118.04s]  Ah, yes, my favorite Lord of the Rings character.
[2118.04s -> 2118.60s]  Minto!
[2121.10s -> 2122.06s]  Yes, I know.
[2122.06s -> 2122.46s]  This is-
[2123.58s -> 2124.06s]  It's okay.
[2126.15s -> 2126.71s]  You're right.
[2126.71s -> 2127.43s]  Yeah, Minto.
[2127.43s -> 2128.55s]  This part's not even in the movie.
[2129.35s -> 2129.75s]  Got it.
[2141.50s -> 2143.29s]  Wait.
[2143.29s -> 2144.25s]  This is my house.
[2145.13s -> 2153.21s]  Where are you going?
[2153.21s -> 2154.57s]  I don't know.
[2154.57s -> 2156.73s]  I have to go find Marion Pippen in the garden.
[2157.53s -> 2158.33s]  Where's the garden?
[2158.97s -> 2165.21s]  Fellowship of the fucking Ring.
[2165.21s -> 2166.09s]  Oh, I found the well.
[2167.80s -> 2168.84s]  Ladders can be climbed.
[2169.88s -> 2172.68s]  I wonder how many lucky wishing stones are at the bottom of this well.
[2172.68s -> 2175.24s]  Oh, I wonder how quickly my legs would break
[2175.24s -> 2177.16s]  if I would have fucking fall straight down to the bottom.
[2179.16s -> 2179.80s]  How do I do it?
[2180.60s -> 2193.13s]  Brodo can grab ledges and hoist himself onto them.
[2193.13s -> 2193.93s]  Jump to what?
[2193.93s -> 2194.33s]  There's a-
[2195.13s -> 2198.12s]  Okay, well, that worked.
[2198.84s -> 2200.94s]  Got default pig sound.
[2200.94s -> 2201.58s]  That's pretty hype.
[2204.20s -> 2204.76s]  Okay, wait.
[2204.76s -> 2205.00s]  What?
[2205.00s -> 2206.60s]  There's only a mushroom up here?
[2207.24s -> 2211.21s]  This is a bootleg copy?
[2211.21s -> 2212.09s]  No, no.
[2212.09s -> 2213.45s]  This is a real copy.
[2214.94s -> 2216.14s]  The game was just not-
[2221.37s -> 2222.65s]  No fucking way.
[2222.65s -> 2223.13s]  No.
[2223.13s -> 2223.69s]  Yes way.
[2224.41s -> 2226.49s]  What does this have on, like, ratings?
[2227.21s -> 2230.76s]  All right.
[2230.76s -> 2233.64s]  If I just splatted and I died and I got a game over screen,
[2235.00s -> 2236.76s]  that would have been very, very funny.
[2237.56s -> 2240.81s]  Click the link.
[2240.81s -> 2241.45s]  Omega low.
[2241.45s -> 2242.01s]  Click the link.
[2242.01s -> 2242.57s]  Omega low.
[2242.57s -> 2243.05s]  Click the link.
[2243.05s -> 2244.87s]  All right.
[2244.87s -> 2245.19s]  Hold on.
[2245.19s -> 2245.59s]  What is it?
[2246.15s -> 2249.53s]  Hobbit Day.
[2249.53s -> 2251.61s]  Hobbit Day is the name used for September 20th,
[2251.61s -> 2253.13s]  a reference to being the birthday of the hobbits.
[2253.13s -> 2263.59s]  I can't even-
[2263.59s -> 2266.47s]  How am I supposed to say about this?
[2266.47s -> 2268.39s]  I can't even combat this.
[2268.39s -> 2269.11s]  It's not fair.
[2269.99s -> 2270.71s]  It's not fair.
[2271.27s -> 2272.30s]  That's not fair.
[2272.86s -> 2273.58s]  That's not fair.
[2277.67s -> 2278.63s]  And it's not-
[2278.63s -> 2279.51s]  That's not fair.
[2280.15s -> 2281.11s]  Life isn't fair.
[2281.11s -> 2281.61s]  Okay?
[2287.27s -> 2288.31s]  Wax you-
[2288.31s -> 2289.19s]  How hairy are they?
[2291.16s -> 2292.44s]  They're a little hairy.
[2292.44s -> 2293.40s]  They're a little hairy.
[2307.16s -> 2308.28s]  Oh, show, show.
[2308.28s -> 2309.32s]  You think I'm gonna get baited?
[2312.22s -> 2312.38s]  What?
[2312.38s -> 2313.42s]  You think I'm gonna get baited
[2314.58s -> 2318.28s]  to like be in somebody's permanent folder on their desktop?
[2325.64s -> 2326.20s]  Oh, dude.
[2326.20s -> 2326.92s]  Yeah, you should show-
[2326.92s -> 2328.44s]  Oh, I wonder how hairy they are.
[2328.44s -> 2328.84s]  Click that.
[2328.84s -> 2329.32s]  Click that.
[2329.32s -> 2329.56s]  Yes.
[2330.12s -> 2330.84s]  Yes, I got it.
[2331.72s -> 2332.44s]  Oh, yes.
[2333.54s -> 2333.78s]  Okay.
[2333.78s -> 2334.10s]  Okay.
[2334.10s -> 2334.42s]  Hold on.
[2334.42s -> 2335.46s]  Calm down.
[2335.46s -> 2336.74s]  Calm down, Frank.
[2336.74s -> 2337.38s]  Calm down, Frank.
[2337.38s -> 2338.10s]  You just got it.
[2338.74s -> 2339.06s]  Okay.
[2339.06s -> 2341.94s]  Now save permanently to computer.
[2342.74s -> 2343.06s]  Okay.
[2343.06s -> 2343.86s]  Save permanently.
[2346.07s -> 2347.03s]  Make two copies of it.
[2347.03s -> 2347.35s]  Okay.
[2348.39s -> 2349.59s]  Oh, yes.
[2350.23s -> 2351.51s]  I can watch this every-
[2351.51s -> 2353.03s]  I can watch this every day.
[2353.03s -> 2354.47s]  I can watch it every single day.
[2355.19s -> 2360.76s]  Come on, get baited.
[2360.76s -> 2364.57s]  Sandieman's mill looks a lot more cheerful than Ted Sandieman.
[2365.29s -> 2366.01s]  Installing.
[2366.01s -> 2366.57s]  I don't-
[2366.57s -> 2367.85s]  Okay, where's the garden?
[2369.14s -> 2370.66s]  I don't care about these little quests.
[2370.66s -> 2374.18s]  I don't want to just go meet the other people in the movie.
[2374.18s -> 2375.14s]  In the book, whatever.
[2376.02s -> 2382.57s]  Oh, Mary and Pippin are in the garden.
[2382.57s -> 2382.81s]  What?
[2382.81s -> 2383.77s]  Where's the garden?
[2383.77s -> 2384.33s]  What garden?
[2388.74s -> 2389.54s]  And where was this?
[2389.54s -> 2391.14s]  The metal stick I have to find?
[2394.18s -> 2395.54s]  I don't even have a map either.
[2402.95s -> 2403.43s]  This is the-
[2403.43s -> 2404.79s]  I'm about to grapple.
[2405.59s -> 2411.34s]  Okay.
[2412.38s -> 2414.30s]  Why do I keep hearing cat puke noises?
[2414.30s -> 2414.70s]  I don't know.
[2426.65s -> 2428.25s]  Guys, I don't think you understand.
[2430.09s -> 2431.53s]  What's the over-under on like the-
[2431.53s -> 2432.49s]  Oh, dude, like show-
[2432.49s -> 2433.93s]  Hey, sweat check.
[2433.93s -> 2434.57s]  Sweat check.
[2434.57s -> 2436.09s]  Oh, yeah, let's do a sweat check.
[2436.09s -> 2436.89s]  Hey, got it.
[2438.41s -> 2439.13s]  What's the over-under?
[2447.37s -> 2447.93s]  Do the game.
[2467.24s -> 2469.82s]  There's a garden right here.
[2470.62s -> 2473.94s]  Oh, no.
[2473.94s -> 2475.67s]  Let's go.
[2476.39s -> 2479.70s]  Why can't I talk?
[2482.15s -> 2484.63s]  Will we be off to see the elves soon, Frodo?
[2484.63s -> 2485.75s]  Soon, Sam.
[2485.75s -> 2487.67s]  I have a few things to take care of first.
[2489.11s -> 2490.23s]  God damn it.
[2490.23s -> 2491.91s]  I can't let this person be right.
[2494.84s -> 2496.44s]  I guarantee.
[2497.48s -> 2500.52s]  I guarantee you not gonna get to the first-
[2500.52s -> 2501.64s]  through the first part.
[2502.60s -> 2504.44s]  A fellowship of the regular PlayStation 2.
[2505.08s -> 2506.12s]  Guaranteed.
[2506.12s -> 2506.92s]  Fucking-
[2506.92s -> 2508.52s]  They can't be right.
[2508.52s -> 2509.64s]  They can't be right.
[2509.64s -> 2510.68s]  They can't be right.
[2511.32s -> 2512.28s]  They can't be right.
[2513.24s -> 2515.00s]  Oh, there's-
[2515.00s -> 2515.96s]  They can't be right.
[2515.96s -> 2516.52s]  I can't.
[2517.16s -> 2517.88s]  You can't win.
[2518.84s -> 2519.48s]  I can't win.
[2520.28s -> 2521.80s]  I have to find a metal stick
[2526.81s -> 2528.49s]  next to the old water mill.
[2529.37s -> 2530.81s]  But where is the old water mill?
[2530.81s -> 2531.85s]  He said, you'll never find it.
[2532.65s -> 2535.77s]  You're never gonna find the metal pin needed for this.
[2535.77s -> 2537.37s]  I guarantee it.
[2537.37s -> 2539.45s]  He looks right in the fucking camera and winks at you guys.
[2540.49s -> 2546.07s]  Hello there, Hal.
[2546.07s -> 2547.83s]  Oh, hello, Frodo.
[2548.15s -> 2551.75s]  You have a beautiful day to begin your trip to Crick Hollow.
[2551.75s -> 2552.87s]  Yes, indeed.
[2552.87s -> 2555.59s]  I'm too old for such long walks.
[2555.59s -> 2558.71s]  I can't even climb high enough to fix my weather vane.
[2558.71s -> 2559.11s]  No.
[2559.11s -> 2560.31s]  What's wrong with it?
[2560.31s -> 2561.75s]  The thing's stuck.
[2561.75s -> 2562.95s]  Sorry to hear it.
[2562.95s -> 2567.19s]  That rascal Sancho Proudfoot was throwing sticks at it.
[2567.19s -> 2568.79s]  Now it won't turn at all.
[2568.79s -> 2570.39s]  I'll take a look at it before I leave.
[2570.39s -> 2571.67s]  All right, I just threw up.
[2571.67s -> 2572.47s]  It's been 45 minutes.
[2572.47s -> 2573.27s]  I have to fucking do this now.
[2573.27s -> 2574.63s]  The ladder's right over there.
[2575.59s -> 2576.23s]  Ladder, let's go.
[2577.03s -> 2580.62s]  Throw a rock at it.
[2580.62s -> 2581.12s]  What?
[2581.58s -> 2585.77s]  Let's go.
[2586.39s -> 2593.70s]  Enter target mode, press L2, and use the analog stick to aim.
[2601.66s -> 2603.66s]  I'm not tall enough to aim at this.
[2603.66s -> 2604.16s]  Wait.
[2604.62s -> 2609.53s]  How do I throw a rock?
[2610.33s -> 2616.52s]  I don't have any rocks.
[2623.82s -> 2631.85s]  Where do I get a rock?
[2632.41s -> 2634.87s]  I don't have rocks.
[2635.43s -> 2637.70s]  Is there a rock like right next to it or something?
[2638.50s -> 2643.37s]  Throw a rock?
[2649.66s -> 2650.06s]  Did he?
[2650.06s -> 2650.54s]  Wait a minute.
[2651.34s -> 2653.66s]  There's just rocks just sitting right next to it or something.
[2654.54s -> 2666.87s]  There's one where?
[2667.51s -> 2670.63s]  I have to find a rock and come back here and throw it.
[2675.78s -> 2676.74s]  Holy shit.
[2676.74s -> 2677.54s]  Follow the road.
[2687.64s -> 2689.56s]  Please, for the love of God, go to the next area.
[2692.92s -> 2696.52s]  Okay, find a rock and find the pin.
[2700.33s -> 2703.61s]  Can't Gandalf just fucking help me do this?
[2705.10s -> 2707.50s]  Gandalf is waiting at the end of the road.
[2707.50s -> 2709.66s]  Who's taking this little shit so long?
[2712.44s -> 2714.86s]  I've got places to be.
[2722.33s -> 2724.41s]  Should have left it to a dwarf instead.
[2724.41s -> 2725.53s]  All right, seriously.
[2725.53s -> 2726.09s]  Where's the rock?
[2726.81s -> 2728.65s]  This is...
[2728.65s -> 2729.29s]  I don't understand.
[2736.66s -> 2737.06s]  Don't...
[2737.06s -> 2738.26s]  Stop walking in circles.
[2738.26s -> 2739.94s]  There is nowhere else to go.
[2741.59s -> 2742.09s]  Guy!
[2743.45s -> 2744.57s]  There's nowhere else to go.
[2753.27s -> 2754.87s]  Minto is a minor character.
[2754.87s -> 2755.35s]  I don't...
[2755.35s -> 2756.15s]  I don't care.
[2757.11s -> 2763.74s]  I need to find a rock and the pin and...
[2767.99s -> 2769.11s]  This book sucks.
[2777.50s -> 2778.86s]  This book sucks.
[2780.31s -> 2780.71s]  Garden...
[2783.58s -> 2786.30s]  If there's an item on the ground that's able to be picked up, it glows.
[2788.18s -> 2789.14s]  Stay on the road, Jerma.
[2789.14s -> 2789.62s]  Stay on the road.
[2789.62s -> 2790.26s]  Stay on the road.
[2790.26s -> 2791.22s]  Okay, I'm going to stay on the road.
[2791.22s -> 2792.02s]  Only on road.
[2792.02s -> 2792.42s]  Only.
[2794.42s -> 2798.71s]  Here we are again.
[2826.98s -> 2827.48s]  Wait.
[2829.59s -> 2830.23s]  Guys leave?
[2844.15s -> 2847.37s]  Oh, I thought I had to do the quests.
[2848.94s -> 2850.70s]  You just walk out.
[2850.70s -> 2852.14s]  I thought it was like, oh, find my...
[2853.66s -> 2857.67s]  I just beat the first level.
[2857.67s -> 2864.46s]  The Shire.
[2864.46s -> 2865.02s]  By water.
[2868.95s -> 2869.75s]  Holy fuck.
[2869.75s -> 2870.95s]  I can't believe I just did that.
[2870.95s -> 2872.23s]  I thought I had to do all that stuff.
[2873.19s -> 2874.47s]  Turns out I didn't.
[2874.47s -> 2875.67s]  Was that all just a joke?
[2876.39s -> 2891.54s]  I'm going to be realistic with you guys.
[2892.34s -> 2898.39s]  Do you honestly think a hobbit with a stick is going to do a goddamn thing?
[2899.77s -> 2901.13s]  Give me a knife or something.
[2901.13s -> 2902.49s]  Or give me like a gun.
[2904.01s -> 2905.45s]  Give me something sharp.
[2905.45s -> 2906.49s]  A hobbit with a stick.
[2908.36s -> 2909.40s]  That's not going to do anything.
[2910.04s -> 2916.12s]  Or like a bow.
[2916.12s -> 2916.44s]  I don't know.
[2916.44s -> 2916.84s]  Anything.
[2927.93s -> 2929.08s]  I don't know.
[2929.08s -> 2929.56s]  Will I?
[2929.56s -> 2930.28s]  Stay on the road.
[2931.08s -> 2932.20s]  What about the guy playing chess?
[2932.20s -> 2933.72s]  Hello, young Baggins.
[2933.72s -> 2935.64s]  Cheers on your birthday.
[2935.64s -> 2937.24s]  Thank you kindly, Daddy Two-Foot.
[2937.24s -> 2938.44s]  I haven't seen your wizard friend about lately.
[2938.44s -> 2940.20s]  Daddy Two-Foot.
[2940.20s -> 2942.44s]  I do miss those fireworks.
[2942.44s -> 2943.32s]  So do I.
[2943.32s -> 2947.72s]  I remember the day when all those dwarves came to call on Mr. Bilbo.
[2948.36s -> 2949.64s]  Dwarves and a wizard.
[2949.64s -> 2952.28s]  I'm sorry.
[2952.28s -> 2953.48s]  It's automatic.
[2953.48s -> 2954.04s]  I have to do it.
[2954.04s -> 2956.44s]  Such strange stories these days.
[2956.44s -> 2960.76s]  Long dead better whites waking near the old forest.
[2960.76s -> 2963.64s]  Great armies in the east and south.
[2963.64s -> 2965.00s]  Dwarves and big.
[2965.00s -> 2965.24s]  All right.
[2965.24s -> 2966.04s]  That's enough out of you.
[2966.04s -> 2966.44s]  Don't care.
[2969.48s -> 2969.96s]  Ring the bell.
[2973.34s -> 2974.46s]  What's going on?
[2974.46s -> 2976.54s]  I don't hold with reckless bell ringing.
[2976.54s -> 2980.94s]  Oh, if any wolves approach the Shire, the bounders will chase them off.
[2980.94s -> 2983.02s]  Just as they chase away foxes and such.
[2983.02s -> 2985.02s]  I'm glad the Shire is well protected.
[2985.02s -> 2989.02s]  Now, if that's all, I've got a mug to return to in the green dragon.
[2989.02s -> 2989.26s]  Okay.
[2990.30s -> 2990.54s]  All right.
[2990.54s -> 2990.78s]  Bye.
[2991.34s -> 2992.06s]  Okay, Gandalf.
[2992.06s -> 2992.38s]  I'm ready.
[2995.06s -> 2995.30s]  Okay.
[2995.30s -> 2996.18s]  Hey, Gandalf.
[2996.18s -> 2996.66s]  I'm ready.
[2997.46s -> 3007.24s]  This is the way that I came.
[3014.14s -> 3014.46s]  No.
[3014.46s -> 3015.18s]  Yes.
[3015.18s -> 3016.14s]  Is it the way that I came?
[3018.81s -> 3019.77s]  He's so bad.
[3019.77s -> 3021.05s]  What a little dick boy.
[3023.13s -> 3023.85s]  All right, dude.
[3024.57s -> 3024.81s]  No.
[3031.99s -> 3033.03s]  Did I come this way?
[3034.62s -> 3035.42s]  I did.
[3035.42s -> 3035.92s]  Didn't I?
[3038.68s -> 3039.16s]  Yeah, I did.
[3039.80s -> 3040.90s]  No, I didn't.
[3042.71s -> 3043.67s]  Wait, is this guy again?
[3043.67s -> 3044.71s]  Hello, Nox.
[3044.71s -> 3046.39s]  Good to see you up and about again.
[3046.39s -> 3047.83s]  Hi, thank you.
[3047.83s -> 3049.59s]  I'm fit as a horse again.
[3050.23s -> 3054.31s]  Folks will be calling me well-preserved like they do your uncle Bilbo.
[3054.31s -> 3056.47s]  That does kind of look like the German painting face.
[3056.47s -> 3059.11s]  Why, it's this new herbal tea I've been drinking.
[3059.11s -> 3059.91s]  Good.
[3059.91s -> 3062.15s]  Well, I'm off to my old bones.
[3062.15s -> 3063.67s]  It's that must be Nox.
[3063.67s -> 3064.55s]  I had perhaps I.
[3066.74s -> 3067.38s]  I don't care.
[3067.38s -> 3069.62s]  Find four healing herbs in Green Hill country.
[3070.42s -> 3071.62s]  For old Nox.
[3071.62s -> 3074.26s]  How about we find Gandalf?
[3074.26s -> 3075.38s]  The guy that I'm supposed to find.
[3076.50s -> 3091.99s]  You're ignoring side quests.
[3094.22s -> 3096.14s]  Why would I do the side quests in this game?
[3096.70s -> 3107.74s]  The Shire.
[3107.74s -> 3109.10s]  Green Hill country.
[3112.46s -> 3113.26s]  Okay, what we got?
[3113.90s -> 3118.06s]  When are we going to get to hear the?
[3118.06s -> 3120.62s]  Here's one of those packets of herbs Nox spoke on.
[3120.62s -> 3121.12s]  Great.
[3125.78s -> 3126.66s]  Hello there.
[3126.66s -> 3127.54s]  Good day, lad.
[3129.08s -> 3130.12s]  Thank you.
[3130.12s -> 3130.84s]  Bilbo.

[3133.24s -> 3135.48s]  Living that grand place atop the hill.
[3135.48s -> 3135.88s]  Frodo.
[3135.88s -> 3136.76s]  It's me Frodo.
[3136.76s -> 3137.72s]  Not Bilbo.
[3137.72s -> 3138.52s]  That's my dad.
[3138.52s -> 3138.92s]  Where?
[3138.92s -> 3139.96s]  Not time to chat.
[3139.96s -> 3141.16s]  I'm off to great.
[3141.16s -> 3141.72s]  On an Arab.
[3141.72s -> 3143.08s]  Uncle, uncle.
[3143.08s -> 3144.44s]  I know it's uncle.
[3144.44s -> 3144.94s]  Stop.
[3145.56s -> 3146.36s]  Thanks, Bilbo.
[3148.33s -> 3151.53s]  We need that meal and Ted says he's too important to go himself.
[3152.41s -> 3154.88s]  Okay, bye.

[3210.52s -> 3214.60s]  Wait, I'm streaming a game and the dev is not here watching me stream.
[3222.28s -> 3223.08s]  Really?

[3227.34s -> 3227.74s]  I don't know.
[3227.74s -> 3228.38s]  I'm just saying.
[3228.38s -> 3229.42s]  What the fuck?
[3229.42s -> 3230.62s]  Why they're not here?
[3230.62s -> 3231.12s]  Okay.

[3240.79s -> 3245.96s]  Do not let pharma maggot's dog spot you.
[3245.96s -> 3247.96s]  Use rocks to distract the dog.
[3247.96s -> 3249.56s]  I'm not gonna throw rocks at a dog.
[3249.56s -> 3250.28s]  Where's this dog?
[3259.21s -> 3259.93s]  Woof.
[3259.93s -> 3261.13s]  What's all this racket?
[3262.17s -> 3263.77s]  That would be me, sir.
[3263.77s -> 3267.53s]  Well, well, we have a burglar in the fields.

[3271.05s -> 3274.25s]  Or would you prefer to take it up with the lads?
[3274.25s -> 3275.69s]  Are there police in this world?
[3275.69s -> 3276.57s]  Right, you are, sir.
[3276.57s -> 3277.29s]  Who are the police?
[3277.29s -> 3279.61s]  Now off with you, or I'll have the lads disperse you.
[3279.61s -> 3281.53s]  Is the lad supposed to be the police?
[3287.66s -> 3288.22s]  Okay.
[3288.22s -> 3290.22s]  Well, I'm stealing your mushrooms.
[3291.50s -> 3292.62s]  Don't let the dog see you.
[3293.18s -> 3295.18s]  Okay, I'm not gonna, I'm gonna make sure the dog, there's a sneak.
[3300.87s -> 3301.35s]  Use rocks.
[3301.35s -> 3302.95s]  I don't fucking have rocks.
[3304.95s -> 3306.55s]  Why does this game think I have rocks?
[3308.81s -> 3310.09s]  I don't have rocks.
[3313.48s -> 3314.84s]  Put the ring on.
[3314.84s -> 3315.64s]  Does he turn around?
[3330.34s -> 3331.06s]  I have rocks.
[3331.06s -> 3331.94s]  I don't have rocks?
[3349.37s -> 3350.09s]  Oh my god.
[3355.51s -> 3356.15s]  There are no rocks.
[3357.03s -> 3358.23s]  I don't have rocks.
[3358.23s -> 3359.11s]  They don't exist.
[3359.11s -> 3360.31s]  I don't have fucking rocks.
[3365.74s -> 3366.38s]  L2.
[3366.86s -> 3367.58s]  X.
[3367.58s -> 3367.98s]  Circle.
[3368.54s -> 3368.78s]  Y.
[3374.33s -> 3375.05s]  X.
[3375.05s -> 3375.93s]  Circle.
[3375.93s -> 3376.17s]  Y.
[3376.17s -> 3376.81s]  It's circle.
[3386.87s -> 3388.15s]  What am I supposed to do with these?
[3396.82s -> 3401.96s]  Is the dog distracted?
[3419.02s -> 3419.50s]  Stop.
[3419.50s -> 3420.54s]  Oh my god.
[3440.98s -> 3441.54s]  Turn around.
[3441.54s -> 3441.78s]  What?
[3442.58s -> 3444.02s]  He turned around for one second.
[3444.66s -> 3457.70s]  All right, hold on.
[3457.70s -> 3458.10s]  I'll get it.
[3458.90s -> 3476.04s]  Oh fuck, was he gone?
[3480.89s -> 3481.93s]  What the fuck was that?
[3481.93s -> 3482.43s]  Get it!
[3483.72s -> 3484.36s]  Healing herb.
[3484.92s -> 3485.85s]  All right, I did it.
[3485.85s -> 3486.57s]  Go in the dog house?
[3496.90s -> 3497.62s]  I got it.
[3497.62s -> 3498.98s]  That's all I needed.
[3498.98s -> 3502.86s]  I wonder what broke this fence.
[3503.50s -> 3504.46s]  What broke this fence?
[3517.21s -> 3518.17s]  The fence is still fine.
[3518.97s -> 3522.26s]  How do I get in here?
[3522.98s -> 3525.70s]  There's a healing herb for grandpa.
[3531.14s -> 3531.94s]  Crawl.
[3531.94s -> 3534.39s]  How do you crawl?
[3534.95s -> 3541.70s]  I don't think you can.
[3542.50s -> 3543.00s]  What the?
[3543.46s -> 3549.37s]  You don't have to be zoomed in for this.
[3554.50s -> 3555.46s]  There is no crawl.
[3556.10s -> 3559.96s]  Maybe the other side?
[3564.12s -> 3565.88s]  Why does this look so blurry?
[3565.88s -> 3570.28s]  Well, because this game is from 20 plus years ago.
[3571.64s -> 3577.05s]  And it was not developed with any intention to ever have...
[3578.01s -> 3580.89s]  Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

[3604.22s -> 3606.46s]  That's one completed.

[4254.62s -> 4269.30s]  of frodo just throwing rocks and stuff and picking up mushrooms the new bonus extended
[4269.30s -> 4275.05s]  extended edition it's six and a half hours long then it just you put the disc in and starts with

[6659.50s -> 6665.26s]  you have to tilt the analog forward a tenth of a centimeter if you go further than that you're
[6665.26s -> 6691.37s]  gonna run don't delete i guarantee i guarantee
[6696.54s -> 6703.42s]  he started yeah i know can you imagine if i hadn't saved it imagine getting back here without saving

[9175.16s -> 9180.04s]  what if i found a game that nobody cared about and nobody played that i could actually just get be
[9180.04s -> 9185.08s]  the world record holder because i beat it slightly faster than normal because i'm the only one that
[9185.08s -> 9207.16s]  cared the lord of the rings no i definitely that's not real all right super frog nancy drew

[11087.38s -> 11091.70s]  that you were going to play a character with a rez because if you didn't you would not be playing
[11091.70s -> 11103.43s]  with these friends without a doubt in your mind if you don't play a character that can take care

[11136.97s -> 11144.44s]  especially with people that don't really care is a lot of people just don't get it and a lot of
[11144.44s -> 11149.82s]  your friends will treat an mmo like they're playing a game of madden all right let's go

[11196.41s -> 11204.06s]  character that your friend was playing with and then eventually that second character you made
[11204.06s -> 11212.50s]  becomes your main character and your friend never plays again past level 12 and you knew that was
