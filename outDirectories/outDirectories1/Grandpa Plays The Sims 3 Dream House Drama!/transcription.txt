[1.78s -> 5.30s]  This one goes out to all you watching the video right now.
[5.30s -> 8.70s]  We're playing The Sims 3, baby, here we go!
[8.70s -> 10.38s]  What will I do?
[10.38s -> 12.38s]  The choices, they're true.
[12.38s -> 16.22s]  I'm not sure, but I want some time to maybe think about.
[16.22s -> 18.22s]  Maybe I'll build a house.
[18.22s -> 20.14s]  Maybe I'll make some food.
[20.14s -> 23.98s]  I don't know, but it's time to begin The Sims.
[23.98s -> 25.42s]  Maybe we'll have some-
[25.42s -> 26.30s]  Oh, shit!
[27.27s -> 27.99s]  Don't pick-
[27.99s -> 28.87s]  Oh, God.
[28.87s -> 33.26s]  This is why you don't move your hands around when you sing a song.
[33.26s -> 35.50s]  I knocked over the fucking lamp that was on his desk.
[36.22s -> 39.59s]  Okay, let's take a look here.
[39.59s -> 41.99s]  Uh, I do not want this biker jacket.
[41.99s -> 43.67s]  Oh, by the way, for those of you who are interested,
[43.67s -> 46.55s]  this is exactly what I look like in real life.
[46.55s -> 50.62s]  Uh, I don't want this like jazz club waiter shirt.
[50.62s -> 52.14s]  Get rid of this fucking thing.
[52.14s -> 53.59s]  What else we got here?
[53.59s -> 55.69s]  We got like the snow vest.
[55.69s -> 59.85s]  We got, um, that weird looking thing.
[59.85s -> 62.46s]  We got Christopher Robin from Winnie the Pooh.
[62.46s -> 63.34s]  No, fuck that.
[63.34s -> 64.30s]  No, thank you.
[64.30s -> 66.25s]  What else we got here?
[66.25s -> 67.05s]  Business man?
[67.05s -> 68.57s]  I think I could put the business-
[68.57s -> 72.18s]  Oh, my God.
[72.18s -> 73.06s]  This is perfect!
[73.62s -> 75.70s]  The smoking jacket with the green.
[75.70s -> 78.18s]  I wear this shit every single day.
[78.18s -> 80.47s]  I don't even wear pants.
[80.47s -> 82.63s]  Okay, so you can't have just underwear.
[82.63s -> 83.99s]  That's bullshit.
[83.99s -> 86.39s]  But anyways, let's make my name here.
[86.39s -> 90.39s]  Grandpa and last name.
[90.39s -> 91.43s]  What is my last name?
[93.86s -> 94.34s]  Yonko?
[95.14s -> 95.62s]  Yombo?
[95.62s -> 97.98s]  I do something like that.
[97.98s -> 99.10s]  Hey, Jeremy!
[99.10s -> 100.98s]  What is that?
[100.98s -> 102.84s]  What's our last name?
[102.92s -> 103.42s]  What?
[104.97s -> 105.93s]  What's your last name?
[107.05s -> 108.33s]  Why do you want to know?
[108.33s -> 109.21s]  Well, just say it.
[110.09s -> 111.37s]  My last name's different.
[111.37s -> 112.41s]  You're on mom's side, so-
[112.41s -> 114.41s]  I don't even know what my fucking first name is.
[116.22s -> 117.26s]  Now let's do it.
[117.26s -> 119.26s]  Let's move into an empty lot.
[119.26s -> 122.14s]  And I'm going to build my dream house.
[122.14s -> 123.66s]  It's going to be so much fun.
[124.30s -> 125.90s]  Loading up the screen.
[125.90s -> 126.62s]  There he is.
[126.62s -> 127.34s]  There I am.
[127.34s -> 127.84s]  Grandpa.
[128.46s -> 131.02s]  So let's do the build tool here.
[131.02s -> 134.86s]  Got to make my absolute dream home.
[134.86s -> 138.14s]  That will rival the celebrities of the world.
[138.14s -> 138.94s]  So let's go here.
[138.94s -> 140.97s]  We need some walls.
[140.97s -> 144.44s]  And I think I'm going to go up this left here.
[144.44s -> 146.12s]  Start with this little hallway.
[146.12s -> 147.24s]  Let's start here.
[147.24s -> 150.60s]  Go all the freaking way.
[150.60s -> 152.04s]  Go all the way up here.
[152.04s -> 152.76s]  Up to stiff.
[152.76s -> 155.50s]  There you have $2,300.
[155.50s -> 157.13s]  Holy shit.
[157.13s -> 158.33s]  Build this over this way.
[158.33s -> 160.65s]  Make sure it's all the way to the right.
[160.65s -> 161.15s]  Okay.
[161.79s -> 162.67s]  That looks good.
[163.23s -> 166.08s]  Bring it all the way down like this.
[166.08s -> 167.92s]  There's my little room here.
[167.92s -> 168.56s]  What else do I need?
[168.56s -> 169.06s]  Oh.
[170.40s -> 171.52s]  Coming down this way.
[171.52s -> 172.24s]  Yes.
[172.24s -> 173.04s]  Yes, I did it.
[173.04s -> 175.08s]  This is a dream house.
[175.08s -> 176.04s]  Okay, let's do it.
[176.04s -> 177.24s]  Build the furniture now.
[177.24s -> 178.68s]  Let's put in-
[178.68s -> 180.12s]  Obviously, I want to-
[180.12s -> 181.16s]  Where's the toilets?
[181.16s -> 183.00s]  I need toilets.
[183.00s -> 184.73s]  Here they are.
[184.73s -> 186.73s]  Make sure we have at least a few of these.
[187.37s -> 189.53s]  Because I don't like to walk.
[189.53s -> 191.93s]  Because my legs are really not that great.
[191.93s -> 197.28s]  So I want at least, let's just say like seven or eight toilets in the house.
[197.28s -> 202.36s]  So wherever I am, I can always just sit down and take a shit if I need to.
[202.36s -> 205.31s]  And that'll be Dandy and Randy.
[205.31s -> 206.51s]  Now we need a-
[207.23s -> 210.83s]  What else is in a house?
[210.83s -> 212.67s]  Bed is lined up the way I want it.
[212.67s -> 213.95s]  Got my fridge.
[213.95s -> 215.55s]  Now I just need a TV.
[215.55s -> 219.71s]  Okay, let's put the stand here so I can watch my murder mysteries.
[219.71s -> 221.47s]  Click on the TV.
[221.47s -> 223.84s]  This TV looks pretty good.
[223.84s -> 226.41s]  Make sure it's lined up with the bed.
[226.41s -> 227.61s]  And it is.
[227.61s -> 229.79s]  My fridge is all set.
[229.79s -> 230.99s]  And I think that's it.
[230.99s -> 232.12s]  That's good.
[232.12s -> 234.56s]  This house is fucking great.
[234.56s -> 237.20s]  I wish I could live in this house for real.
[237.20s -> 240.16s]  It's got everything I could ever need.
[240.16s -> 242.24s]  Get over there.
[242.24s -> 244.96s]  Go see your new house.
[244.96s -> 246.88s]  Why am I talking to a mailbox?
[246.88s -> 248.24s]  I'm not that stupid.
[248.24s -> 252.52s]  And apparently I have a stick up my ass by the way I'm running.
[252.52s -> 253.88s]  Yes, I love the bed.
[253.88s -> 256.44s]  We are agreeing on that together.
[256.44s -> 257.48s]  As one.
[257.48s -> 258.96s]  So what am I going to do?
[258.96s -> 260.72s]  What TV show am I going to watch first?
[260.72s -> 261.92s]  Maybe Murder, She Wrote?
[262.88s -> 263.28s]  What?
[264.75s -> 266.97s]  Why am I?
[266.97s -> 268.84s]  What is this?
[268.84s -> 271.08s]  Why am I just fucking puke?
[272.72s -> 274.48s]  Oh, so I just made Sherma.
[274.48s -> 275.92s]  He's on the left.
[275.92s -> 277.52s]  Jeremy is my grandson.
[277.52s -> 278.08s]  He's...
[278.08s -> 280.16s]  I think that looks just like him, but...
[280.16s -> 282.00s]  He's apparently being a real asshole.
[282.00s -> 283.28s]  There's nothing I can do about this.
[283.28s -> 285.52s]  Besides, tell him this is my house.
[285.52s -> 287.28s]  You're under my rules.
[287.28s -> 290.00s]  And you need to learn to be respectful.
[290.08s -> 292.32s]  And now he's pissing his pants.
[292.32s -> 294.24s]  I don't know why that's happening.
[294.24s -> 297.93s]  There's a toilet literally one inch to his left.
[297.93s -> 299.56s]  Okay.
[299.56s -> 302.46s]  You know, I made way too many of these lights.
[302.46s -> 305.34s]  I probably should turn some of these off or delete them or something.
[305.34s -> 307.47s]  How do you turn that off?
[307.47s -> 308.51s]  Yes, go do it.
[308.51s -> 311.34s]  I'm supposed to be cooking dinner right now on the stove.
[312.14s -> 314.52s]  Please turn the damn light off.
[314.52s -> 315.16s]  Where's Sherma?
[315.16s -> 316.28s]  Can he turn it off?
[316.28s -> 318.68s]  Oh good, I think he's going to do it right now.
[318.68s -> 321.00s]  Go turn that off and we'll get going here.
[321.00s -> 321.64s]  You don't have to be...
[322.38s -> 323.66s]  Oh, no.
[323.66s -> 324.62s]  Oh, there's a fire.
[324.62s -> 325.26s]  There's a fire.
[325.26s -> 326.86s]  Somebody put that fire out.
[326.86s -> 329.18s]  Don't just stand there looking at it, you fucking idiot.
[329.18s -> 330.06s]  Put your fire out.
[330.06s -> 332.78s]  Use the fire extinguisher or call the goddamn police.
[333.66s -> 334.86s]  Oh, he's running now.
[334.86s -> 337.26s]  Yeah, go ahead and run, you coward.
[337.26s -> 338.38s]  Where is he going?
[338.38s -> 339.90s]  Where are you running to?
[339.90s -> 341.72s]  Where do you think you're going to go?
[341.72s -> 343.00s]  It's a small fire.
[343.00s -> 344.68s]  Grandpa will take care of this one.
[344.68s -> 345.48s]  I got this one.
[345.48s -> 345.96s]  Don't worry.
[345.96s -> 346.84s]  Extinguish the flames.
[349.24s -> 349.88s]  Who is that?
[351.32s -> 353.00s]  Who is this guy that just came to the house?
[353.56s -> 355.48s]  Who are all these people coming to the houses?
[355.48s -> 356.76s]  What the fuck is going on?
[357.64s -> 361.24s]  Yeah, I'm so glad you guys all ran over here to just scream at my fire.
[361.24s -> 362.04s]  Like, thank you.
[362.04s -> 363.88s]  Will somebody call the police?
[363.88s -> 365.08s]  Is that going to be a thing?
[365.08s -> 366.36s]  Can somebody do that, please?
[367.44s -> 368.64s]  Oh my god.
[368.64s -> 370.24s]  It's the fire spreading now.
[371.58s -> 372.86s]  Yeah, whatever.
[373.74s -> 376.22s]  Well, that's going to wrap up this video.
[376.22s -> 379.66s]  My whole freaking house is burning down and nothing I can really do about it.
[380.30s -> 383.74s]  But if you liked this video, then click on that like button
[383.74s -> 386.06s]  and show Grandpa some support, baby.
[386.06s -> 387.26s]  And that's going to be it.
[387.26s -> 389.42s]  So I'll see you all later.
[389.42s -> 391.12s]  And bye.
[391.12s -> 394.46s]  I'll tell you the next time I play this game,
[394.46s -> 397.58s]  I'm going to have your goddamn fire extinguisher ready to go.
[397.58s -> 400.22s]  And not only that, I'm going to have a fucking phone next time
[400.22s -> 403.10s]  so I can call the police and my friends and stuff.
[403.10s -> 404.70s]  You'll see next time it's going to be a lot different.
[404.70s -> 405.82s]  I will make sure of that.
