[5.56s -> 9.24s]  Seven minutes. Seven minutes is all I can spare to play with you.
[45.62s -> 49.78s]  We're up here!
[94.21s -> 96.38s]  I can't move! I can't do anything!
[102.38s -> 106.82s]  Can we please just shoot?
[116.16s -> 117.16s]  Seven minutes.
[121.78s -> 122.78s]  Dodge! Dodge! X!
[130.78s -> 132.78s]  I'm gonna grab those, make sure I get them.
[134.54s -> 137.54s]  Hold on, I have the poison. Let me just shoot them and...
[138.78s -> 139.78s]  I've been kicked.
[140.78s -> 141.78s]  I couldn't give him the poison.
[142.78s -> 143.78s]  Hold X to like...
[144.78s -> 146.78s]  Hold on. I forget what we have to do here.
[148.14s -> 149.14s]  Oh, it's a red herb.
[150.14s -> 152.14s]  What is this? It's broken. Something's broken.
[153.14s -> 154.14s]  Smash this.
[155.96s -> 158.96s]  Alright, this is a giant rifle here.
[160.90s -> 162.90s]  This is legitimately like...
[164.78s -> 166.78s]  We're not hiding. What do you mean there's no point in hiding?
[166.78s -> 169.78s]  Alright, I'm about to drop like a fucking nuke right next to you.
[170.78s -> 174.07s]  I need to get to like a good spot.
[174.07s -> 176.07s]  He's dancing. He's literally dancing.
[176.07s -> 180.07s]  I think we can like... Oh no, we can... I remember we can like turn off the lights.
[181.89s -> 183.89s]  And he's like, ah, where are you? I'm an idiot.
[183.89s -> 185.26s]  Okay, so we'll come over here.
[185.26s -> 186.26s]  Are these the lights?
[186.26s -> 188.26s]  Yeah, it's dark over here. Watch, he's gonna go...
[188.26s -> 190.26s]  Oh, what the... Oh, I can't... Never mind.
[192.26s -> 193.43s]  I think I'm dying.
[195.50s -> 197.50s]  I think I'm dead. You killed me.
[200.15s -> 206.00s]  Saturation.
[207.00s -> 211.76s]  I'm dead.
[217.78s -> 220.05s]  You're dead.
[222.44s -> 224.44s]  I thought that was for you.
[225.68s -> 229.68s]  There is no way we would be able to stand on this lava rock inside the volcano.
[230.68s -> 235.68s]  No, what are you talking about? It's probably like a cool, clean, chill 68 degrees right here.
[237.05s -> 239.05s]  We've got like a high of like 70.
[239.05s -> 242.05s]  Yeah, it's probably like 60, 70 degrees right now.
[242.05s -> 248.05s]  It definitely would not be like over 180, like three, five, six hundred thousand degrees.
[251.91s -> 253.91s]  Why am I on this?
[253.91s -> 254.91s]  I have to make my way around.
[255.91s -> 256.91s]  What the fuck?
[260.74s -> 262.74s]  Wait, me? What? Hold on.
[263.74s -> 265.74s]  Climb up. Climb up.
[269.74s -> 271.49s]  I'm having trouble doing this.
[272.49s -> 273.49s]  My hands getting tired.
[274.49s -> 275.49s]  I'm coming.
[276.49s -> 277.49s]  I have to tap this shit.
[280.18s -> 281.18s]  I'm punching this rock.
[281.18s -> 282.18s]  Oh my god.
[283.18s -> 285.18s]  I actually pulled myself.
[286.18s -> 287.18s]  Oh, you saved yourself?
[289.57s -> 292.57s]  You would never be able to do that in real life.
[292.57s -> 293.57s]  Just one arm, pull yourself up.
[294.57s -> 298.57s]  Dude, that rock is like 12,000 pounds.
[299.57s -> 301.57s]  There's no way you'd punch that rock.
[303.57s -> 304.57s]  I just spit everywhere.
[305.57s -> 308.57s]  You're like punching a fucking rock, like Rocky Balboa.
[320.75s -> 324.04s]  What the fuck just happened?
[326.22s -> 328.84s]  Get over there and start punching the fucking rock.
[329.84s -> 334.27s]  Here we go. This rock is a hundred times bigger than me.
[335.96s -> 337.96s]  He's like making his way over to you.
[338.96s -> 340.96s]  There's no way you're going to do it in time.
[341.96s -> 343.14s]  He's like right behind you, dude.
[343.14s -> 344.14s]  You're so dead.
[354.25s -> 356.25s]  Something tells me we would do it. Something's wrong.
[358.58s -> 360.58s]  But I'm pretty sure if we walk near him, he's just going to...
[362.58s -> 364.58s]  This is not good. He's just in the way.
[365.58s -> 367.58s]  Is there anything we can do? Wait, can you?
[368.58s -> 371.52s]  I'm going for it. I'm going for it.
[372.52s -> 373.52s]  He just fell in the lava.
[376.66s -> 378.66s]  Will you stop swinging at nothing?
[379.66s -> 381.66s]  No, no, no. That's a bad idea.
[382.66s -> 384.09s]  What is this dumbass doing?
[385.09s -> 387.90s]  Looks like he's painting a mural on the wall.
[388.90s -> 390.90s]  Oh, God. Oh, here he comes now.
[391.90s -> 393.90s]  Oh, this is over. This is it.
[394.90s -> 395.90s]  This is it. This is it. We got to go now.
[396.90s -> 397.90s]  We got to go now. We got to go now.
[398.90s -> 406.22s]  Ready, partner?
[407.22s -> 409.22s]  Locked and loaded. Suck on this.
[410.22s -> 411.91s]  Yeah, you didn't fire, did you?
