[0.18s -> 16.22s]  Yeah, Megaton, I know. I know, this is the town. Seven years ago, I would have been,
[16.22s -> 22.14s]  well, what's this town? You blow it up, or you don't blow it up. I know, I can't wait.
[22.14s -> 28.45s]  Hey, Dr. Church, I really appreciate it. Thank you for healing me. Have a good day, and may
[28.45s -> 36.51s]  the Force be with you, as they say in Fallout 3, and maybe may the Force be with you. Take
[36.51s -> 42.24s]  it all, take it all, take all of it. Take literally everything on his fucking desk,
[43.12s -> 50.22s]  take his drinks, take his whiskey, take his fan. Give me that, give me everything, take all, take
[50.22s -> 58.06s]  it all. Activate the terminal and fucking just fuck up his computer too. I seriously can't help
[58.06s -> 68.90s]  myself. Why would I need utensils? What? Oh shit, they sent me to take their fucking silverware and
[68.90s -> 78.48s]  plates and stuff. I gotta get out of here. I'm sorry. Give me the fuck too. I'm such a fucking
[78.56s -> 85.20s]  kleptomaniac. I have to take everything. I'm sorry. Give me this light. Give me that book.
[85.20s -> 89.60s]  Open up. I don't even know what's in the fridge. Give me all of it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please
[89.60s -> 102.50s]  don't kill me. How are the noodles? Are the noodles any good? They're pretty good. What?
[102.50s -> 106.27s]  No, I was trying to eat the noodles. I wasn't trying to steal the noodles. Are you serious?
[108.59s -> 116.85s]  Do I have to pay for them? Can I get a drink around here?
[117.17s -> 119.57s]  I'd like to report someone.
[122.45s -> 128.51s]  Okay, you've been very helpful. Thank you. Okay, how do I put my gun away? There we go.
[128.51s -> 145.20s]  See, I'm no threat. I'm threatless. You guys just on me, huh? The guy told me to come in here.
[146.77s -> 153.95s]  I don't understand. Wow, that's a lot of stuff. That's a lot of stuff. That's a lot of things I
[153.95s -> 164.99s]  can do. Activate the vat system. Right in the head. Did bullets even come out of the gun?
[166.75s -> 177.94s]  What? Wow. Wow. Wow. Way too many. Way too many. Fuck it. We're going for it. It broke. It broke.
[177.94s -> 188.35s]  They broke it. They shot it out of my hands and it broke. Why are they fighting? Why are they fighting?
[188.35s -> 197.71s]  Who told them to do this? Did I? It's the lady. All right, one guy is just watching this shit.
[201.01s -> 212.38s]  Kick his ass. Come on, Dr. Lee. And your winner by knockout, Dr. Lee. And your prize is to watch
[212.38s -> 219.26s]  this guy fucking die. We gotta be smart about this. We gotta move. We gotta move quickly
[219.26s -> 223.76s]  because they're after us. So let's go. I don't want any dilly-dallying. Hurry up.
[228.96s -> 234.21s]  Assault. Assault. This guy's assaulting me. What does she have for a weapon right now?
[235.49s -> 253.06s]  Is it a flashlight? Watch out for the barrel. She just rocked the guy.
[268.80s -> 278.38s]  You sadistic murderer. Your co-workers. Because I shot somebody with a gun.
[279.26s -> 287.90s]  Fear. Somebody just like blew up over here. Oh boy. They're like evil farmers. Are you serious,
[287.90s -> 296.64s]  guys? What the fuck was that? What are you guys doing? Okay, two very important questions from
[296.64s -> 301.12s]  what just happened right there. Number one, why are you running at a guy in power armor
[301.12s -> 305.76s]  with a baseball bat? And what teleported through space-time in the sky? A spaceship from outer
[305.76s -> 312.00s]  space landed right in front of him and a big green alien jumped out and started eating people.
[312.40s -> 318.40s]  And what did our hero do, you wonder? He came up with the most cleverest of clever plans.
[318.40s -> 324.98s]  Sticky look. If we're gonna go through this journey together, you're gonna need to shut up. What?
[328.90s -> 339.47s]  Once upon a time, there was this dog. His name was Holy Toledo and he was really powerful.
[339.47s -> 344.91s]  And one day, these giant super mutants attacked him and tried carrying him off.
[344.91s -> 354.74s]  And what did our hero do, you wonder? He... That was a great story. That's the town right there.
[355.92s -> 361.44s]  I just gotta hit the remote detonator, blow the town up, and I get my cut from you two clowns?
[362.00s -> 369.28s]  Okay. Well, I guess I probably should have told you this before. That I'm a fucking double agent!
[378.06s -> 392.35s]  Okay. You are just looking all over for me. No need to hide. It'll all be over soon.
[392.83s -> 396.29s]  I'm not gonna come out of stealth. I'm not an idiot. When you turn up,
[396.29s -> 400.34s]  you're dead. I didn't know they could even have rocket launchers.
[401.46s -> 421.98s]  Level up! I don't know. I'm not really lost. I don't really want to report anybody. Yeah,
[421.98s -> 428.02s]  River City is run by a council. Yeah. Oh, there we go. Okay. Yeah, I think there might be ants in
[428.02s -> 434.00s]  my room. Bye. Hey, can you check it out for me? Thank God I found somebody because I seriously
[434.00s -> 441.76s]  have no idea, like, who I was even supposed to talk to about this. Yeah, so, I mean, I think I
[441.76s -> 446.56s]  might have left some food out. That might be what happened. We did have a party here last weekend.
[446.56s -> 449.76s]  I know we're supposed to report on all of our parties, so I'm just letting you know.
[449.76s -> 453.60s]  And there was, like, maybe eight people here. But I'm sorry, I don't...
