[0.25s -> 10.57s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Dermot here with Alien Isolation.
[10.57s -> 14.57s]  This is a brand new Steam game that came out a couple days ago.
[14.57s -> 19.57s]  And it's a horror game survival where you survive the alien.
[19.57s -> 25.81s]  Yes, it is. I'm Ripley's, uh, Ripley's, believe it or not, daughter, believe it or not.
[25.81s -> 32.78s]  So I guess you need to explore in this game. There was a crash, oh no.
[32.78s -> 37.45s]  I need to investigate the mystery of the crash, which is what I plan on doing.
[37.45s -> 44.14s]  Let's go ahead and go. Oh, fuck. That's him.
[44.14s -> 47.14s]  Can I get away without him seeing? That's the main thing that's got to be...
[47.14s -> 50.14s]  No, no, he's right behind me. He's right behind me. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[50.14s -> 55.14s]  If I can make it up these stairs, please. It's an alien. It's a fucking alien.
[55.14s -> 63.42s]  Hey, where is he? Where'd he go? The doors are all locked.
[63.42s -> 66.42s]  I'm trapped in this spooky game. What do I do?
[66.42s -> 70.42s]  Oh, I guess I could climb in here. Turn my flashlight on.
[70.42s -> 74.73s]  An achievement. Nice. You know, I love getting achievements, especially when...
[74.73s -> 77.73s]  There he is. There he is again. He's in the vent. He's in the vent. He's in the vent.
[77.73s -> 81.73s]  Get out of the vent. Out of the vent. Down the stairs. Through the metal detectors.
[81.73s -> 85.73s]  Hopefully I don't have any weapons. Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[85.73s -> 88.73s]  Straight down, straight down, straight down the stairs.
[88.73s -> 90.73s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on. I know you can hide.
[90.73s -> 94.73s]  Hide in here. Open it. Okay.
[95.73s -> 100.27s]  I don't want to... If I make any noise, I'm going to be in a lot of trouble.
[100.27s -> 104.27s]  God, there he is. Oh, please don't come in here and kill me.
[104.27s -> 109.33s]  What the fuck is he doing? He's eating chicken. That's psycho.
[109.33s -> 112.57s]  He's eating chicken for... He's eating chicken for God's sake.
[112.57s -> 115.57s]  Time to go. Time to go. Get out, get out, get out, get out.
[115.57s -> 119.57s]  I'm going to go this way, up to the right. I think I'm in the clear.
[119.57s -> 123.00s]  Pretty sure I'm in the clear right now. I don't know though.
[124.00s -> 127.00s]  He's got a food item. He's got another food item. He's got ham now.
[127.00s -> 130.00s]  What does he got? Chicken, ham, drinks? What does he got? Everything?
[130.00s -> 133.00s]  I'm going to hide in this corner here. I've never seen the tutorial.
[133.00s -> 136.00s]  The tutorial said hide in a corner and he might not be able to see you.
[136.00s -> 142.67s]  So I'm going to take his advice in areas he's just conga-ing right now.
[142.67s -> 145.67s]  Which is a bad sign because they conga when they're very happy.
[145.67s -> 148.67s]  Aliens will do that. He must have just gotten a kill on a soldier in the top there.
[148.67s -> 152.67s]  I just don't want him to come this way. Thank God he's a brainless fuck.
[152.67s -> 155.67s]  And he went the other way. I don't know how he did not see me.
[155.67s -> 158.67s]  It's bright out here. But I need to be careful.
[158.67s -> 163.67s]  Because if he is going to pop at me again and hit me, I don't want that to happen.
[163.67s -> 166.67s]  No, no, no, no. Okay, okay. There he is. There he is. That was weird.
[166.67s -> 169.68s]  You know, hold on. He doesn't even know I'm here.
[169.68s -> 173.30s]  Can I just bash this guy's fucking head in?
[173.30s -> 179.30s]  I just beat the game. I just beat the game. I just beat Alien Isolation.
