[3.06s -> 12.17s]  Hey, oh, I almost just fell down through my ground. How you doing? Welcome back to the stream, everybody.
[15.37s -> 38.55s]  MakaS, what? Uh, hold on, is there something wrong? What's wrong? No, not again. Hold on, what's
[38.55s -> 53.58s]  wrong? Hello? Why is this doing this? This is- there's no- there's no sound effects on. There's no-
[54.38s -> 58.38s]  Okay, this- I- I don't know what just happened. I don't know why there was- I don't know- I
[58.38s -> 62.71s]  don't know what happened. What I do know is now it's gone, and...
[68.09s -> 77.38s]  On the GoXLR, there's an effects button. You can press it, and I didn't press it. It shouldn't
[77.38s -> 87.38s]  be doing that at all. That button was not pressed. We sound- we're good now? We sound fine? We're good,
[87.38s -> 95.90s]  right? This is a good audible level. I think we sound fine. Let me turn this off. Okay. Where's
[95.90s -> 102.30s]  the shoe? Yeah, I know. I know. Let me- I can address the shoe situation in just a moment. Just
[102.30s -> 109.98s]  wait for people- people have to trickle in for it. Uh, whatever. I'm just gonna talk about it right
[109.98s -> 118.87s]  now. You can link to this if you want. The shoe eating stream had to be postponed because there-
[118.87s -> 125.46s]  There's been, obviously, a lot of, um, panic in the grocery stores. There's been a lot of,
[125.46s -> 130.90s]  like, the national emergency being called, countries being locked down. It- it was actually
[130.90s -> 137.61s]  kind of not on the priority list at the last, like, three or four days. It actually was probably
[137.61s -> 145.19s]  gonna be pretty hard to get somebody to make a comedy shoe. So, because, like, the bakery that
[145.19s -> 151.02s]  I was gonna use was not really, uh- it's kind of hard to do that the last two or three days.
[155.75s -> 161.51s]  I was gonna have a fucking comedy shoecake made, all right? That's the joke. And now it's- I-
[161.51s -> 170.95s]  what am I supposed to do? I have to tell you the joke. What it is. Now you have to eat a real shoe.
[172.10s -> 177.54s]  I'm not eating a real shoe. You could make 15 accounts if you want. Dermal lied about eating
[177.54s -> 184.18s]  a real shoe. And plus, it was a me costume, by the way. I don't have to eat a real shoe. I- I
[184.18s -> 195.40s]  could eat, like, a fucking Ring Pop if I want. Eat shoe. Eat shoe. I'm not gonna eat a real shoe.
[196.36s -> 202.44s]  Why would I ever eat a real shoe? Think about this. I- you guys have to process this information.
[203.56s -> 215.88s]  Imagine eating a shoe. You can't eat a fucking shoe. You said. Yeah, I- how many fucked up things
[215.88s -> 220.90s]  have I said on this stream? You can't eat a shoe. I'll- I will have to go to- I'll have to go to,
[220.90s -> 225.54s]  like, the hospital if I eat a shoe. I'll die if I eat a shoe. If you eat a shoe, you die. Right?
[226.26s -> 233.42s]  Like, you can't just eat a shoe. Leather is edible. You want me to go buy, like,
[233.42s -> 237.02s]  leather shoe? I'm not- no, leather- no, no, no, no. I'm not- why do I- I'm getting a little
[237.02s -> 245.98s]  worked up now. I'm- yeah, I gotta calm down. I'm not eating a fucking real shoe. I'm not eating a
[245.98s -> 251.72s]  fucking shoe. I had, like, a comedy routine planned out and it kind of fell through.
[252.36s -> 258.58s]  Doesn't mean I'm not gonna do it. I'll- okay, I will eat a comedy shoe within the next two weeks.
[263.32s -> 268.68s]  I'm not gonna eat a real one. I'm not spending any more time on, on, like, eat the fucking shoe.
[268.68s -> 275.86s]  I'm not gonna spend any more time on this. Don't- don't talk about- why are people talking about
[275.86s -> 284.98s]  that? That's pre-stream chat spoilers. Come on. Just have them make- you can eat leather shoes
[284.98s -> 299.13s]  if you boil them. No, you can't. No, you can't. No, you can't. You can't eat shoes. No, you can't.
[300.26s -> 308.79s]  I'm not eating a fucking shoe. Okay, here you go, guys. I will eat a shoe if there- if- no,
[308.79s -> 314.55s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not fucking going over this. I'm not gonna boil a pair of
[314.55s -> 323.72s]  leather shoes. I love the- I love- the best response to this is, in all capitals, look it up.
[324.94s -> 330.62s]  Yeah, um, I could eat the t-shirt that's on me right now, probably, if I boil it and, like,
[330.62s -> 336.06s]  remove the ink. Do I- am I gonna do that? No, it's very bad for you. It's probably not- it's
[336.06s -> 347.32s]  not- it's probably so bad for you. Eat a shoe, you poser. Um, you can't call somebody a poser
[347.32s -> 352.86s]  for something that literally no one has done on stream. I- I wouldn't be the poser. I'd be
[352.86s -> 357.35s]  the first guy that's fucking ever done it. That's not a poser. I'd be the first guy.
[369.29s -> 378.49s]  Okay, TLDR. He read it. He's a Reddit user. TLDR. Um, some of the purchases I would have wanted to
[378.49s -> 386.01s]  make and the coronavirus has caused a lot of widespread kind of panic and people buying a
[386.01s -> 390.97s]  bunch of shit. Grocery stores locked down. Places are, like, you know, it's not- it wasn't on the
[390.97s -> 395.37s]  priority list the last two or three days. It's been difficult. We're trying to get through this shit.
[396.25s -> 407.22s]  That's an excuse. It's not, though. Preparing for, like, a- all right, let me give you a list of
[407.22s -> 415.90s]  things. Uh, preparing to eat a comedy shoe versus prepare for a global pandemic. Which one of those
[415.90s -> 422.98s]  two things is more important, do you think? I mean, we gotta get some priorities somewhere.
[422.98s -> 444.28s]  It's just- all right. We're gonna play Binding Advising. This doesn't mean that I'm not gonna
[444.28s -> 448.92s]  eat the comedy shoe, okay? Just pretend that we just gotta- you gotta give me some time.
[448.92s -> 465.00s]  All right, I'm gonna go over something real quick. Uh, real quick. Uh, so there are lines out the door.
[465.64s -> 469.48s]  All the grocery stores and all the bakeries and stuff. But I say I- I lump bakeries into the
[469.48s -> 473.40s]  grocery store because I'm a fucking liar. Uh, but there are literally lines out the door for the
[473.40s -> 477.16s]  grocery store. People are freaking out, buying, like, water, buying, like, thousands of dollars
[477.16s -> 482.82s]  in groceries. And I was gonna have this bakery in the grocery store. Make- make this. Imagine the guy
[482.82s -> 487.14s]  walking in there. It's like, oh my god, we gotta get toilet paper. We gotta get water. We gotta get
[487.14s -> 492.02s]  fucking, um, we could just buy a bunch of frozen foods. There's hundreds of- hundreds of people,
[492.02s -> 495.46s]  thousands of people in these grocery stores. And I'm the guy that walks up to the- to the
[495.46s -> 500.31s]  bakery counter and is like, hey, can you make me a fake funny comedy shoe?
[503.82s -> 510.30s]  Excuse me, sir. Uh, this, like, I gotta- I gotta deal with something over here. Uh,
[510.30s -> 522.47s]  can you make me a funny shoe cake? Uh, sir? Can you look around? Yeah. Sir, this is a fucking
[522.47s -> 531.58s]  global emergency. I need you to make me a funny cake today. Anyways, welcome to the stream.
[531.66s -> 540.25s]  Take care of yourselves. Be careful. Uh, actually- actually be careful, right? Do your own due
[540.25s -> 545.13s]  diligence. Take care of your friends and family members, especially the older ones. Because,
[545.13s -> 548.89s]  you know, but this is- this is- this is the real deal. You know, you can't fuck around.
[548.89s -> 565.50s]  Just be careful. If you have shoes in your house, eat them. All right, we're over the she- we're over
[565.50s -> 571.24s]  the eating shoes thing now. I'm excited for this because I haven't played Binding Visage in a long
[571.24s -> 582.30s]  time. Uh, this is Anti-Birth. Uh, we talked about this last week. A lot. And, uh, I- you know,
[582.30s -> 589.90s]  when- when you get something in my brain, shit becomes- I can't get it out. My mic is going
[589.90s -> 605.53s]  in and out? What is wrong with this fucking thing? What? Hello? Hello? All right, here we go.
[605.53s -> 613.74s]  Shouldn't be doing that. That was a one-guy moment? All right, fine. Anyways, um, we're gonna play
[613.74s -> 617.78s]  Binding Visage. But this is gonna be a gamer stream. I haven't- haven't been in one of these in a long
[617.78s -> 625.58s]  time. But what was the last- Jeremy plays a video game and, like, does- doesn't, like, fucking walk
[625.58s -> 636.78s]  into walls and stuff? How- when- how long ago was that? It hasn't happened. Mario? Two streams ago?
[636.78s -> 646.89s]  Was it? Sekiro? Oh, it was all right. I mean, Mario was okay. But it was probably Sekiro. This is the
[646.89s -> 654.44s]  first time. All right. When does the official- now, here you go. You- people- I know, go ahead and
[654.44s -> 660.57s]  laugh. Like, make fun of me. This is- this is an old save file. Yes, okay. Hadn't even beaten the
[660.57s -> 667.00s]  game on Hard with Eve yet. I know. You can laugh. But I- this is, like, an old rebirth file. I just
[667.00s -> 676.31s]  want to make sure that I didn't have to beat Mom's heart, like, ten times. This is- I had to- this is
[676.31s -> 689.77s]  an old rebirth save file that got pulled. I don't even know who these two are. Minus five. Yeah, but
[690.65s -> 696.02s]  when you play Binding Visage, you just- if you don't- by, like, the third floor, if you're like,
[696.02s -> 707.14s]  nah, nah, this ain't working. You just quit. Ah, why did I say that? People are gonna make fun of me.
[707.14s -> 712.20s]  What? You- you gotta go all in. Fine, y'all. We'll go all in. All right, who do I want to play with?
[712.20s -> 718.95s]  Kane? I got nothing on Hard of beating on with Kane. I could literally do anything with Kane.
[718.95s -> 724.84s]  Let us pick. We'll do in Kane. This is the anti-birth mod, by the way, and soon it's going to be
[724.84s -> 730.30s]  official. I don't know when, though. I really actually don't know. And why are we- why is the
[730.30s -> 737.96s]  start button getting pressed over and over again? All right, it's been a while. Uh, dude, this is
[737.96s -> 747.10s]  anti-birth, not afterbirth, just so you know. Yeah, this is anti-birth. Anti-birth. This is not afterbirth

[1477.37s -> 1482.10s]  should have known what i was getting into and i was like i'm gonna play isaac today if you say
[1482.10s -> 1486.26s]  you're gonna play the binding of isaac what you actually are trying to tell your chat is scream in
[1486.26s -> 1497.16s]  all capitals missed rock every time you see one i can't get in here no i'm not oh don't get mad
[1497.72s -> 1511.38s]  where's this missed rock nice nice eyes how did you see that and not me i don't doesn't make i
[1511.38s -> 1520.46s]  don't it's because you i'm i'm playing the game you're not playing the game no damage up items
[1520.46s -> 1525.11s]  it's like really actually is bad there's another one i can't promise to blow it up i don't have
[1525.11s -> 1544.09s]  anything missing rocks i can't blow them up all right so i brought this up like a few streams
[1544.09s -> 1553.18s]  ago and i didn't really give it much thought until very recently and maybe even today is this one of
[1553.18s -> 1558.36s]  my most favorite games ever made is this like on the on the list somewhere i think it is i think
[1558.36s -> 1567.69s]  it has to be i i keep coming back to him playing this game like hundreds of times i don't do it
[1567.69s -> 1571.69s]  with anything else i used to do that with like team fortress and like that's it how could this
[1571.69s -> 1583.32s]  not be on that list maybe oh we've got a devil don't go in there oh this build is really bad
[1586.20s -> 1598.87s]  range up you hate to see that wait what you really hate to see that uh and these are all awful
[1600.20s -> 1608.60s]  we got a familiar that shoots with me spectral tears or die it that item is i'm not why would i
[1608.60s -> 1619.11s]  get that that item is just guaranteeing you're gonna die eight times i'm not taking that take
[1619.11s -> 1625.21s]  guppy why would i take that you get one heart and it's just i'm gonna die nine times and then
[1625.21s -> 1630.97s]  going to have to reset not if you're a gamer guppy transformation yeah but that's not guaranteed
[1644.07s -> 1654.42s]  wrong order idiot what are you talking about i mean wrong order why would i get it i don't know
[1654.42s -> 1659.62s]  because this this all right this build sucks so this is like a who gives a shit build you could
[1659.62s -> 1666.65s]  have taken all three i don't know why i'm gonna hold what do you mean take all three press f6 or
[1666.65s -> 1676.12s]  f7 for stats somebody confirmed that before i press it i'm gonna just kill me i don't know
[1676.12s -> 1690.76s]  what that does oh shit okay that just freaked me out i googled it that's our in options no they're
[1690.76s -> 1707.13s]  not old r i know what that does it doesn't work like the original flash isaac wait what we're
[1707.13s -> 1714.46s]  going for guppy because that's the only way that this works out what are these um well these like
[1714.46s -> 1722.62s]  little like white things on the ground are these like collectibles not supposed to be making any
[1722.62s -> 1729.67s]  jokes that was a mistake this is no joke stream that was not even funny what are these i was
[1729.67s -> 1732.63s]  trying to think of what looks like this i was gonna say marshmallows and then i just said
[1732.63s -> 1740.57s]  collectibles holy shit that was very bad oh you know these collectibles that was bad that was
[1740.57s -> 1744.78s]  desperate oh what are these things through the ground i think if something looks that small and
[1744.78s -> 1755.61s]  white something small and white uh collectibles i don't have seen these guys before either these
[1755.61s -> 1766.10s]  things are crazy what was that laugh i don't use pictures of fucked up is it where i die
[1771.19s -> 1777.37s]  don't when you see like three or four champions in a room you just you just accept that you're
[1777.37s -> 1784.07s]  gonna die but i guess i didn't all right remind me to blow this up when i get uh bob's brain back
[1785.75s -> 1796.33s]  f7 all right on sub i'm not gonna press f7 it's gonna kill me that's probably like the
[1796.33s -> 1802.54s]  suicide button or something right like items that you have you can like die and then maybe
[1803.18s -> 1811.82s]  is there a die button in isaac i think there is f7 i'm not gonna press f7
[1814.26s -> 1819.38s]  there's no stats in this one because it's tied to rebirth but this i'm on a mod right now guys
[1819.38s -> 1849.48s]  what the fuck really yeah they're going yeah just press it they added it to anti-birth f7
[1849.48s -> 1865.58s]  no that's not what i want i don't care about that i care about the stats f6 all right let's go
[1865.58s -> 1879.53s]  whoop that rock okay i'm gonna get two bombs and one key oh well shit and it's the worst thing is
[1879.53s -> 1886.82s]  it this the poison tears aren't they tied it's tied to luck how often it procs right yeah that's
[1886.82s -> 1901.11s]  fantastic oh there's a a demon heart watch out for these these ah well this runs egg fucking stupid
[1901.11s -> 1916.81s]  this run sucks hey well at least i can die 10 fucking times wait a second i have the ankh too
[1917.29s -> 1920.84s]  so i have the ankh and i can die 10 times
[1925.02s -> 1935.13s]  that's so dumb oh boy i don't know what these guys do when they die some of them explode oh
[1935.13s -> 1947.59s]  they just do the oil okay no you also shoot what the fuck one of them was a bomb
[1949.77s -> 1961.74s]  what oh that was a heal it scares the shit out of me sometimes how come how come greed modes
[1961.74s -> 1967.50s]  not in this because it has an anti-birth thing i talked about this in the pre-stream chat and
[1967.50s -> 1970.86s]  i'm the only person in the world that likes greed mode apparently i thought it was like fun
[1971.50s -> 1980.82s]  i was like oh man maybe she should maybe uh pog greed mode and everyone's like no fuck you greed
[1980.82s -> 1987.62s]  mode sucks greed mode fuck greed mode i'm like oh my god i thought i was gonna get like oh pog
[1987.62s -> 1995.62s]  greed mode no lay not fucking up but i'm about dumb mode sucks delete it oh fuck okay sorry
[2002.47s -> 2016.46s]  open look at my damage 420 that's it i'm gonna get this up is it chat hates greed mode yeah why
[2016.46s -> 2028.62s]  what's wrong with it laughing my ass off it's so funny it's so funny oh so that means
[2032.97s -> 2037.61s]  the statistics this that's statistically impossible that's not to blow up where i wanted to do
[2038.82s -> 2044.74s]  that's statistically not even possible it was like 5000 pixels of space but where that could blow up
[2049.86s -> 2063.22s]  your luck is down that doesn't mean that doesn't mean anything what is this oh okay yeah i know
[2063.22s -> 2066.98s]  people are going to be telling me not to do that and shit but it doesn't matter i take every pill
[2066.98s -> 2072.34s]  instantly no matter what it is i don't care what it is if i see question marks it's being taken
[2072.34s -> 2086.47s]  immediately there's no strategy here oh what's that glasses is this double shot oh yes it is
[2087.03s -> 2108.94s]  yes okay run save run actually saved i need some hp up though hold r to save run answers vision
[2108.94s -> 2114.23s]  does this open up the secret room so i i don't remember what these do oh i hate these guys
[2114.79s -> 2127.27s]  i'm thinking of a different enemy actually this is not bad at all i'm thinking of the ones that
[2127.27s -> 2136.33s]  get up and they spit like forward if i hate those guys still this damage really actually suck all
[2136.33s -> 2147.34s]  right uh what does answers do it was the entire map yeah let's go no wait i should probably save
[2147.34s -> 2153.88s]  this i should say this is like when i go in the next round yeah next floor all right so where's
[2153.88s -> 2159.64s]  the secret room let's see uh secret room is either up here down there no it's definitely over here
[2159.64s -> 2167.80s]  it's definitely that that that middle section right has to be like right here right this is
[2167.80s -> 2192.76s]  correct not damn okay so what so then it's over uh up up here bottom left by the boss room no no
[2193.56s -> 2207.43s]  what a fucking idiot i'm gonna say here god damn it secret room has to be surrounded by at least
[2207.43s -> 2213.26s]  two these are these are these guesses are perfectly fine these these are perfectly normal
[2213.26s -> 2221.93s]  this is how you decide grab the hearts i can't pick up hearts i have no heart containers that
[2221.93s -> 2225.93s]  was perfectly reasonable for me to think it was in the middle or up here it's very reasonable
[2234.42s -> 2243.86s]  give this double shot dude look at this fucking double shot oh and there's poison on it too give
[2243.86s -> 2250.28s]  me my luck back give me give me my luck back give me damage up and we got and we're talking this no
[2250.28s -> 2259.61s]  no i mean i can hurt people with this i've gotten such shitty boss room item
[2259.61s -> 2271.99s]  it's all right do the challenge room i don't do those the bandage is is insane
[2273.13s -> 2281.00s]  oh hold on does this can i use this and will it give me the site will it remove the curse no
[2282.49s -> 2288.79s]  will it not come on i hate this i hate this because i lose track especially when you get
[2288.79s -> 2304.68s]  later on in the game so we're going down first remember we went down what's the question mark
[2305.08s -> 2309.77s]  under the question mark on the top right what's that little red question mark in the box like the
[2309.77s -> 2324.95s]  melted box what is that is that the curse are we going right watch out for that oh oh oh oh
[2324.95s -> 2344.30s]  what am i watching like a fucking sports game oh oh oh oh oh just take this whole entire like
[2344.30s -> 2351.83s]  however long this bot is just put it up next to like the red sock no no no no no oh come on
[2352.47s -> 2360.33s]  come on ref that this has got to be like a referee in this game at some point like a referee enemy
[2360.33s -> 2370.81s]  uh this thing's dumb come on ump there is okay i've seen a lot of minus twos on this i think
[2370.81s -> 2374.42s]  that's actually kind of a funny one i think that's actually i think that's kind of funny
[2375.06s -> 2382.02s]  i think that's funny all right i can walk i'm just no i'll lose i'll forget where this is whatever
[2382.02s -> 2390.90s]  i'm gonna i might i'm gonna need to cross um uh oh here we go all right do i go in here with the
[2390.90s -> 2395.46s]  two keys or do i use the two keys on the item room we're going we're going all in and it was
[2395.46s -> 2408.26s]  a fucking the right call two hearts stupid worthless see in my mind they can't all be
[2408.26s -> 2417.43s]  fucking bad in a row they can't but apparently they can uh two hearts don't need it hang man's
[2417.43s -> 2436.60s]  fine this tier is down getting real close to resetting what was what i just beat the game
[2436.60s -> 2440.97s]  on hard with pain right that's the thing i had that's not a long there's not over here he's
[2440.97s -> 2453.34s]  gonna be reset randy no i'm not not today i know what you guys do i've played this game sometimes
[2453.98s -> 2463.54s]  all right is it weird for me to actually say that when you get tears down from the pills that is
[2463.54s -> 2470.33s]  almost an immediate restart no matter where you are in the game right that's like that's like an
[2470.33s -> 2478.84s]  instant fucking just restart immediately instantly but i'm not going to i'm not going to um i think
[2478.84s -> 2488.54s]  i am gonna do this though because i need no i'm not a child maneuver is that me being a child
[2488.54s -> 2498.38s]  or is it me being realistic all right we gotta go we went down right i gotta go up wait did we go
[2498.38s -> 2513.45s]  left now we gotta go up i might come on i might use the uh hangman over there get the fires or
[2513.45s -> 2520.87s]  something i forgot how much i liked this game i mean i don't get me wrong i played this a ton
[2520.87s -> 2527.43s]  on my switch like in bed but you know i just forget just how much you fucking like something
[2528.15s -> 2536.12s]  didn't get hit one time by the way you know a lot of you thought that room was going to be
[2536.12s -> 2549.91s]  impossible to not get hit shit i tried to sneak by i got stuck on the rock in tears down and the
[2549.91s -> 2562.33s]  guy would have been dead already what's that mean what's that little what was that little like
[2562.33s -> 2576.38s]  insurance commercial jangle mean that does that does i see something to find something why is
[2576.38s -> 2588.57s]  it i don't i don't play i've never played anybody he doesn't know i actually don't know tears down
[2588.57s -> 2598.79s]  let me take it i got extra i know what the blast damage is but that's just that's pretty good
[2599.59s -> 2603.78s]  that's wait does that count for my active right now that counts for the active right
[2604.50s -> 2616.14s]  that's a that's blast damage technically right or is it only bomb well we're gonna get some free
[2616.14s -> 2630.01s]  bombs i forgot it's okay i forgot how huge okay we're good oh what is that thing all right i have
[2630.01s -> 2633.69s]  enough money for this what is it what is this thing all right i gotta i gotta look this up on
[2633.69s -> 2647.08s]  my fucking platinum god cheat sheet what's it called where is it uh the cheater you do the same
[2647.08s -> 2655.53s]  thing you can't keep track of everything in this game what does it look like it's a it's like a
[2655.53s -> 2664.34s]  face it's a face with like a bunch of needles in it where is this is this an anti-birth item
[2664.34s -> 2674.28s]  i don't see it anywhere what does it look like yeah that's i don't see that on my platinum god
[2674.28s -> 2689.50s]  list anti-birth like uh rebirth items i don't see this on the platinum god list it's called voodoo
[2689.50s -> 2698.74s]  head there it is this item has a chance to spawn additional curse rooms on each future floor that
[2698.74s -> 2711.22s]  kind of sucks oh wait a minute no it doesn't because guppy first rooms are yeah that that's
[2711.22s -> 2720.25s]  not bad because that's doesn't guppy spawn in the curse rooms more often yeah i'm going for it let's
[2720.25s -> 2735.54s]  go and give me some more money i want more money um i'll just take it out of here hold on okay i'm
[2735.54s -> 2751.88s]  fine oh he's not dead what oh he's not dead i thought he was dead and tears down all right
[2751.88s -> 2771.70s]  i gotta be careful that's not good that's not good did i even get to the item room yet i didn't did i
[2771.70s -> 2784.17s]  what did i get in the item room the bombs all right okay all right here we go i can't believe
[2784.17s -> 2813.78s]  i missed all right get out of here there we go milk now we're cooking although there are hearts
[2813.78s -> 2821.67s]  somewhere weren't there that's mega built yeah i'll let you have that one i'll let you have that
[2821.67s -> 2828.60s]  one temporarily oh i don't even need hearts regeneration oh the reveal item right right
[2828.60s -> 2841.72s]  right right right don't lose that one where's that down down right wait if i had any luck at all this
[2841.72s -> 2857.43s]  would be this would be great this way ah here we go why did i do that i mean waste i can only hold
[2857.43s -> 2866.01s]  one item i can't hold more than one item in my lower right look see i can't hold that i've used
[2866.01s -> 2881.51s]  it in the boss room why would i need to do that to blow these up to get a maybe a spirit heart
[2881.51s -> 2891.14s]  maybe but my luck is zero i don't i gotta save these bombs to bosses that's my damage man
[2891.14s -> 2906.26s]  my damage sucks ass right now don't click the link i have no plan on it here we go bang oh this is a
[2906.26s -> 2911.75s]  double shit this is a big one double all right i love when he's a good look at this you don't
[2911.75s -> 2923.99s]  mean all right we do the item rooms we went down we'll do okay i love this oh how much damage did
[2923.99s -> 2940.44s]  that not do what didn't know you could do that i was gonna make a joke say like oh here's a tip
[2940.44s -> 2945.02s]  on isaac you can these guys can eat the bombs but i feel like if anyone's played this game for more
[2945.02s -> 2965.99s]  than an hour they'd know that already oh we use that hangman right here huh it has to be greed
[2965.99s -> 2980.97s]  of course it does oh shit minions somebody get the alts that's actually really that's really good
[2980.97s -> 2991.13s]  i got a steam sale from that everything 50 off what's this who cares take it instantly speed up
[2991.13s -> 2996.70s]  hey what those fire i thought only the red ones did what the fuck do those things do

[3012.49s -> 3043.53s]  mario sunshine what's the timing here down here okay i got the timing ready you have to go
[3043.53s -> 3059.02s]  holy shit that's bad you use one of the bombs nice use the key i don't want to use the key
[3059.66s -> 3065.42s]  that's not cheating guys i can die nine more times i'll be all right the way this is going
[3065.42s -> 3070.14s]  to be a problem is if i don't have more than like two or three hearts going into like womb two
[3072.47s -> 3084.71s]  oh jeez i don't know i don't know the tech i don't know the tech on these guys

[3150.60s -> 3165.77s]  i don't have any keys great this is fantastic they're inspired by the legend of zelda um i
[3165.77s -> 3171.78s]  would say this game reminds me more of star tropics than it does of zelda in fact it's
[3171.78s -> 3181.69s]  almost the exact same video game those who don't know what that is i'm seeing a lot of question
[3181.69s -> 3186.41s]  marks but some of you guys don't know the the the beauty of one of the great star tropics is
[3186.41s -> 3197.06s]  is it one of the you you don't know it and it's sad that you don't one of those games are like
[3197.06s -> 3201.46s]  nobody gave a shit about when it came out the regular nintendo it is this exact video game

[3242.49s -> 3247.83s]  if i pick that up it's gonna give me half of an eternal white heart and as long as i do not take
[3247.83s -> 3253.59s]  damage that will remove that white heart and i go to the next floor i will gain one full heart

[5254.57s -> 5260.89s]  what i say by this is remember back in 2012 when somebody would make a let's play of a game
[5260.89s -> 5267.85s]  and it would be 12 minutes and you'd make a new video every 12 fucking minutes that's why i never
[5267.85s -> 5272.01s]  played these games i never did let's plays could you imagine if i only streamed for 12 minutes a
[5272.01s -> 5284.94s]  day anyways i'm playing with uh this is cain and i see you guys in uh 12 or 15 separate youtube

[5328.22s -> 5335.58s]  whole game until his phase three he becomes the second easiest boss in the game but for some
[5335.58s -> 5342.62s]  reason i have so much trouble with the third phase because my brain um is made out of eggs

[7507.45s -> 7511.43s]  all i did here was just delete a full heart for no reason because i just don't it's too much it's
[7511.43s -> 7516.23s]  too it's too unlucky guys i already take every pill every single time you want to go in every
[7516.23s -> 7544.17s]  curse room this is bad news i think i got that one coin hog it's worth it one doge coin that's
[7544.89s -> 7561.74s]  it's not even funny but it is why is that funny it is all right let's go to the keynote i mean if
[7561.74s -> 7566.78s]  i had like a million dollars right now i would just keep having like halving halving halving
[7566.78s -> 7591.80s]  halving my tier delay until it was like 0.2 he's malding where do you get that idea there's a hard
[7591.80s -> 7597.80s]  cap of five tiers well although technically true you can go under the cap if you have things that
[7597.80s -> 7608.25s]  half your tier delay even if you have a tier delay item it'll work that is that is actually
[7608.65s -> 7627.11s]  she's called me a nerd for knowing that all right okay well how you want to respond to that one
[7627.11s -> 7639.30s]  i should what should i say no i'm not go in curse room if i have extra health to work with i will
[7639.30s -> 7646.18s]  i don't uh i'm not gonna do this either if i had like four or five full hearts i'd probably do this
[7646.18s -> 7657.77s]  and you need like a i'm not doing it use door on key what are you talking about get rid of the
[7657.77s -> 7683.08s]  carters everyone's got a wedgie i actually kind of do that i i do actually it's been bothering
[7683.08s -> 7697.22s]  me for like the last 15 straight minutes so the person's not wrong what's this brain worm
[7697.22s -> 7714.34s]  ding brain worm let's look it up brain worm mist tears will redirect themselves and travel
[7714.34s -> 7737.56s]  sideways towards enemies holy shit this is unbelievably good that's very very good the
[7737.56s -> 7745.18s]  amount of times that you miss by one or two pixels in this game is that corrected completely this is
[7745.18s -> 7752.36s]  awesome well maybe not quite that kind of wow this is great okay now all i need is a shit load
[7752.36s -> 7770.47s]  of tears up and like plus 10 damage and 10 more hearts and i should i'll beat the game seeing the
[7770.47s -> 7778.44s]  beam is like i'm about to hold r it's just but it's just such a waste of an item oh she's gonna
[7778.44s -> 7783.72s]  be looking to do sad face the bean he doesn't like to be no nobody does nobody thinks that item is
[7783.72s -> 7808.90s]  any good gemini look at that tier corrector working flawlessly the strategy with this guys

[12662.46s -> 12666.81s]  i'd rather just dodge them than have to worry about them spinning around in random circles
[12667.45s -> 12675.94s]  because after the rift is over it fucking throws like that see i thought that was a portal for a
[12675.94s -> 12684.89s]  second pick him up for the good ending all right did we go we go further down or is that i haven't

[13792.90s -> 13800.76s]  one to take is it better than having a slot machine though they both pretty terrible look up how to do
[13800.76s -> 13844.55s]  the anti-birth path okay fine okay cheating well i kind of want to know chapters uh any
[13844.55s -> 13851.10s]  birth introduces four new chapters after unlocking a secret exit locked doors to the new chapters will

[13991.45s -> 13997.69s]  right now if i do this like this is like this is okay okay okay but it shouldn't be now filters
[13997.69s -> 14022.02s]  off look at that shit um let's do the other room he's immersive and i'm getting pretty immersed
[14022.02s -> 14031.40s]  in the game right now the game is just fun it's just fun to throw a hundred dice in the air and
[14031.40s -> 14046.38s]  look at them all that's really what this game is just throw a hundred dice in the air and count
[14046.38s -> 14065.08s]  how many sixes you have and then do it again just do that irl that would be so bad that would be so
[14065.08s -> 14083.90s]  bad this thing is so so so key dice throwing stream what if i did that one day i just got like
[14083.90s -> 14092.54s]  30 dice and i just was making random bets with you guys rose repeat what's this okay if i'm
[14092.54s -> 14097.34s]  gonna throw dice in the air and if it's anywhere between 20 and 50 then i win and if it's anything
[14097.34s -> 14122.76s]  else you win shit i don't have any keys deal that would be such a pain in the ass
[14125.10s -> 14128.06s]  i would have to throw a bunch of dice in the air and then suck them all up in a vacuum it

[28222.68s -> 28239.48s]  something right important but yes this is very important it's very important i think it needs to
[28239.48s -> 28258.44s]  be even worse than this to be honest with you like i think it needs to be like this is good like it's
[28258.44s -> 28267.45s]  supposed to be very bad like worse way worse this is this like looks good but don't spoil that for

[28348.87s -> 28355.11s]  be well uh the tourist shop ps why didn't you record or stream your first blood-borne playthrough
[28355.11s -> 28361.51s]  you've robbed us you absolute biscuit well that's a very easy answer because i wasn't a streamer
[28362.79s -> 28366.71s]  back when blood-borne came out and i played it three or four times in a row
[28367.83s -> 28374.39s]  it was i had a twitch account i streamed maybe once every four or five months maybe twice a year
[28374.39s -> 28381.86s]  or something it wasn't really until like 2015 2016 that i really started actually streaming
[28382.82s -> 28389.99s]  and spending more than three four plus kind of days a week doing it uh it's before twitch
[28390.55s -> 28401.24s]  before i started using it time for another one maybe maybe uh thank you hall of one zombie for
[28401.24s -> 28405.32s]  the 250 did you ever play out of this world i'd imagine you'd enjoyed it old school platformer
[28405.32s -> 28411.48s]  but really memorable i have played i have played it but another world that is what they made for
[28411.48s -> 28419.56s]  some reason uh they changed the title i don't know why another world out of this world the
[28419.56s -> 28429.16s]  same game dude what he did scream it but what wasn't i shit faced or something wait i did
[28429.16s -> 28441.34s]  stream it for like an hour right i was like drunk i was like shit faced right shit was i drunk when
[28441.34s -> 28455.00s]  i did this there was a i remember what the going the transition from boston to vegas i got trashed
[28455.00s -> 28464.58s]  one night and played like 10 games in a row like minecraft and was that part of that the fake
[28464.58s -> 28478.30s]  stream no no i think this actually happened that was the best worst stream ever this was in 2016
[28478.30s -> 28487.61s]  this was a 2016 stream i don't wow i guess maybe i did it once but i have played out of this world
[28487.61s -> 28494.33s]  and it is very interesting uh fun story about out of this world or another world uh the person that
[28494.41s -> 28501.27s]  did that that is responsible for making that game i'm gonna make sure i get this correct because
[28501.27s -> 28505.91s]  it's pretty cool it's pretty cool piece of information i believe it's the same person that
[28505.91s -> 28511.26s]  did the heart of darkness game is that a complete lie i don't think it is remember the heart of
[28511.26s -> 28520.82s]  darkness game that's not a lie right that's true that's that's that's correct right yeah i just
[28520.82s -> 28525.54s]  want to make something sometimes you you have this knowledge but you don't remember if it's real or
[28525.54s -> 28532.23s]  not is that ever happened to you guys uh that game is also fun i streamed that game i never
[28532.23s -> 28537.61s]  beat it though because it's very hard and very frustrating but i have streamed heart of darkness
[28537.61s -> 28551.72s]  it's very fun wait did i beat it i might have hey spoons for self-defense thanks for 15
[28551.72s -> 28557.08s]  dollars 1500 bits thanks a lot for that hey germa i don't mean to alarm you or anything

[28589.82s -> 28595.59s]  what brand would you recommend for someone who has long gaming streaming sessions well i would
[28595.59s -> 28602.71s]  recommend the uh toilet because a diaper is not going to help you because even if you like shit
[28603.19s -> 28609.88s]  you still have to clean yourself up so that's not going to do very much for you if you piss in a
[28609.88s -> 28617.06s]  diaper you're just making yourself dirty you just pee into the bowl in the toilet so that's not
