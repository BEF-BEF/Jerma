[0.63s -> 11.13s]  I feel like I'm in a Disney movie, where the main character comes into class, and he's late by one second, and he gets detention.
[11.13s -> 15.93s]  Okay, let's see what I'm talking about. He's got like books in his hands. He's like, oh no, my first day!
[15.93s -> 22.52s]  Sprinting down. Which one? 102? Where's 102 math? Oh shoot!
[22.52s -> 26.44s]  Before he drops a book on the ground, he gets in. He doesn't sit down.
[26.44s -> 30.70s]  Mr. Albertson, you're late.
[30.70s -> 32.30s]  Oh man.
[32.30s -> 36.89s]  And we don't take kindly to late students.
[37.72s -> 43.42s]  And I get, they get detention. Is that what's happening right now?
[43.42s -> 46.14s]  It's a JoJo reference?
[46.14s -> 50.84s]  That happens in Jo... Guys, everything happens in a TV show.
[50.84s -> 57.78s]  You know, just, if you have any idea how many TV shows exist, think of every second of television.
[57.78s -> 61.86s]  I'm sure what I'm saying has happened in a hundred different series.
[61.86s -> 66.30s]  Yeah, that was a fucking JoJo reference.
[66.30s -> 70.18s]  No, it's a human reference. Because people are late.
[70.18s -> 74.60s]  And then if people make references to human behavior in their TV shows.
[74.60s -> 76.60s]  I'm never watching it now.
[78.22s -> 80.78s]  Wait, is that? Oh, that's a meme. Okay. Sorry. Hold on.
[80.78s -> 83.51s]  I'll be right back. See, I gotta tweet this. Be right back.
[83.51s -> 117.16s]  All right. So tonight we're gonna do obviously community content night.
[118.44s -> 122.62s]  Make sure I don't hear myself in my own microphone. Good thing I don't.
[123.58s -> 125.58s]  Let's make sure I don't hear this either.
[126.62s -> 131.34s]  We gotta have a good OST. What's a good OST?
[132.06s -> 134.81s]  Gonna be ready for more JoJo tonight?
[135.37s -> 140.25s]  I have something to tell you. Those of you waiting for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Video Files.
[141.05s -> 146.57s]  I don't think there's any. I think there might be one reference to it.
[146.57s -> 152.36s]  I don't think there's any. This is up till March 1st, by the way.
[153.08s -> 157.00s]  So this is from late January all through February.
[157.72s -> 159.48s]  And we're gonna do another catch up here.
[160.78s -> 163.10s]  We're gonna do a second community content night.
[163.98s -> 168.86s]  Probably at some point a week or so from now.
[169.58s -> 171.90s]  And we're gonna try to catch up through March into April.
[171.90s -> 175.26s]  So then we'll be really actually caught up with community content night.
[177.29s -> 178.49s]  Boomer content night.
[186.50s -> 187.70s]  I didn't like where my mic was.
[188.42s -> 189.06s]  I changed it.
[190.76s -> 193.32s]  Anyways, yeah, we have a lot of submissions.
[193.32s -> 195.64s]  A lot of stuff to go through. Gonna hang out and play.
[195.64s -> 199.40s]  We have a bunch of subs. AmnesticOW.
[200.04s -> 202.22s]  Just gave 10 community subs. Thank you Amnestic.
[202.22s -> 203.74s]  And The Chef's Corner.
[204.86s -> 207.66s]  I feel like the last few nights, last three or four streams,
[207.66s -> 211.26s]  The Chef's Corner has opened us up with at least five to ten community subs.
[211.26s -> 212.62s]  So thank you. It's a lot.
[213.94s -> 214.66s]  Thanks both of you.
[215.38s -> 219.77s]  I missed the pre-stream chat. PepeHands, it's okay.
[219.77s -> 220.81s]  There'll be plenty more.
[222.31s -> 224.79s]  So tomorrow, after we do this,
[225.35s -> 229.51s]  tomorrow is gonna be public domain movie night.
[229.51s -> 231.11s]  And I have a few things to say about that.
[232.07s -> 235.43s]  So we're gonna start with The Gorilla.
[235.43s -> 242.02s]  The Gorilla is a public domain movie from 1939 about a killer gorilla.
[242.98s -> 247.11s]  Apparently the movie sucks total ass.
[248.28s -> 250.84s]  And it's only an hour long.
[250.84s -> 253.32s]  This full movie is one hour long.
[253.32s -> 254.84s]  So we're gonna be watching another one too.
[258.62s -> 261.02s]  I'm trying not to look too hard into this movie.
[261.82s -> 268.22s]  But I've heard that it's a horror comedy, if you could believe it.
[268.22s -> 270.47s]  And we're gonna open with it.
[270.47s -> 272.63s]  And we have to watch the whole thing. That's part of this.
[273.67s -> 276.47s]  We don't get to skip anything. We don't get to change anything.
[276.47s -> 278.63s]  We have to stay there and watch it for the hour.
[278.63s -> 280.63s]  Well, you don't have to, but I do.
[280.63s -> 281.59s]  Because it's my stream.
[282.74s -> 284.74s]  It's like, if you think it's stupid, you're like,
[284.74s -> 286.18s]  no, I'm fucking out of here. That's fine.
[286.18s -> 287.38s]  I have to watch the whole thing.
[289.94s -> 290.90s]  So we'll see.
[291.62s -> 295.66s]  But I'll have a second one queued up after that, which will be a mystery movie.
[296.55s -> 298.23s]  I was speaking of more subs.
[299.46s -> 301.46s]  Nondescript Civilian and Neftwitch.
[302.71s -> 305.27s]  Nondescript gave 10 community subs.
[305.27s -> 307.59s]  And Neftwitch gave five community subs.
[311.11s -> 313.59s]  30 community subs have come in in like the last 30 seconds.
[313.59s -> 314.15s]  Thanks, guys.
[315.56s -> 317.32s]  Vod viewers will skip.
[317.32s -> 323.34s]  The one time we're being a VOD viewer is like, whoa, you got an advantage here.
[323.98s -> 325.70s]  Telling you.
[325.70s -> 331.93s]  Play Yoshi's Island OST. Yeah, we gotta get a good OST.
[335.00s -> 337.64s]  Let's do an OST that we haven't done like a thousand times.
[340.26s -> 344.12s]  We keep doing Yoshi's Story and stuff.
[348.25s -> 351.70s]  Invader is another five community subs.
[351.70s -> 352.98s]  Thanks for another five.
[353.62s -> 355.94s]  It makes like 40 or 30 or 50.
[356.74s -> 358.58s]  I can't even keep track. There's just so many.
[358.58s -> 360.26s]  You guys give so much money to this stream.
[360.26s -> 361.30s]  It's fucking insane.
[362.10s -> 363.61s]  Mario Galaxy.
[363.61s -> 365.77s]  Mario Galaxy is too upbeat, I think.
[366.65s -> 367.61s]  Mario Galaxy is like...
[372.57s -> 373.05s]  That's too...
[373.69s -> 374.73s]  I don't want to be so energetic.
[375.53s -> 377.61s]  I need to be relaxed and hanging out.
[381.08s -> 381.72s]  Sonic Rush.
[381.72s -> 382.52s]  No, that's too much.
[382.52s -> 383.00s]  That's too...
[383.00s -> 384.04s]  That's a heavy guitar.
[384.04s -> 385.00s]  I don't want a heavy guitar.
[385.64s -> 390.42s]  Hollow Knight.
[391.46s -> 392.63s]  Now, that's...
[397.91s -> 399.51s]  That's interesting to me right now.
[399.51s -> 400.55s]  Hollow Knight OST.
[401.59s -> 403.98s]  Oh, let's check it out.
[405.42s -> 411.91s]  Okay.
[411.91s -> 417.00s]  Hey, Aiden, thanks for the five community subs.
[417.64s -> 420.39s]  It's like a little too fast, though.
[420.39s -> 421.19s]  Is there a slow part?
[421.99s -> 424.09s]  It's too upbeat for me.
[426.41s -> 427.77s]  I feel like I'm going to fight with somebody.
[427.77s -> 428.41s]  No, not too...
[429.05s -> 433.42s]  All right, let's start here.
[433.98s -> 434.95s]  All right, yeah.
[435.51s -> 436.31s]  Here we go.
[436.31s -> 437.27s]  That's the busted up one.
[437.27s -> 437.59s]  All right.
[438.63s -> 439.99s]  So, we're going to move on here.
[441.19s -> 442.84s]  To a...
[444.20s -> 445.91s]  This thing.
[445.91s -> 449.13s]  And move on to this thing.
[449.69s -> 453.27s]  There's no PC game on.
[453.27s -> 454.15s]  Let's move over here.
[454.15s -> 455.11s]  Hey, look at that.
[455.91s -> 458.81s]  I already got one.
[459.45s -> 460.49s]  Is this a JoJo reference?
[460.49s -> 461.53s]  Did I say no JoJo?
[461.53s -> 462.25s]  Is this a JoJo?
[462.97s -> 465.86s]  No, it's not.
[465.86s -> 468.54s]  This is not a JoJo reference.
[469.10s -> 471.18s]  Not everything is a...
[471.18s -> 472.22s]  That's too fast.
[472.86s -> 476.17s]  Not everything is a JoJo's reference.
[476.81s -> 480.73s]  Why am I saying JoJo's like it's a family restaurant?
[481.45s -> 484.23s]  Come on down to JoJo's.
[486.47s -> 489.27s]  Fried fish and a side of sweet potatoes.
[489.27s -> 490.63s]  Only $9.99.
[490.63s -> 496.38s]  All right, let's go.
[497.90s -> 499.50s]  Once I turn this on, I can't turn it off, right?
[499.50s -> 500.46s]  I hope I'm not naked.
[500.46s -> 500.70s]  Okay.
[501.34s -> 505.61s]  Once this is on, it can't turn off.
[506.17s -> 508.50s]  That's too...
[508.50s -> 509.30s]  That's too fast.
[509.94s -> 510.58s]  Oh, hold on.
[511.94s -> 513.94s]  It's got zits all over me.
[513.94s -> 514.34s]  It's been...
[514.34s -> 514.82s]  All right.
[514.82s -> 515.22s]  It's off.
[515.22s -> 515.78s]  I'm turning it off.
[516.34s -> 519.72s]  No, this is too fast.
[520.28s -> 521.24s]  Here we go.
[521.24s -> 525.03s]  How do you like better lighting?
[526.18s -> 529.24s]  Oh, the light's on.
[529.24s -> 530.74s]  Don't make fun of my hair.
[530.74s -> 531.62s]  It's like all fucked up.
[531.62s -> 533.62s]  I haven't had a haircut in like two months, three months.
[533.62s -> 534.18s]  I can't...
[534.98s -> 536.02s]  Somebody just give 20 subs.
[536.02s -> 536.26s]  Hold on.
[536.26s -> 538.34s]  Let me fix this fucking bad video.
[539.06s -> 545.99s]  Somebody just give 20 community subs right now.
[546.71s -> 549.67s]  Blast Master just gave 20 subs.
[550.39s -> 552.90s]  Thank you, Blast Master.
[553.46s -> 554.41s]  I know.
[554.41s -> 554.73s]  It's like...
[554.73s -> 556.25s]  It got like wispy hairs.
[556.25s -> 558.41s]  Usually the stylist like...
[558.41s -> 561.13s]  Yeah, and I had a little bit of a problem this morning with my finger.
[562.01s -> 562.81s]  I got it cut.
[563.77s -> 564.17s]  Yeah, look at that.
[564.17s -> 566.01s]  Look at this like big flap of hair.
[568.63s -> 569.91s]  It's all wrong.
[569.91s -> 570.71s]  It's all wrong.
[571.43s -> 572.95s]  I'm gonna do it like this.
[575.14s -> 575.46s]  I cut...
[575.46s -> 577.94s]  This is from a hummus container, by the way.
[579.10s -> 581.50s]  I slid my finger already to open the hummus container
[581.90s -> 581.98s]  and I just...
[581.98s -> 583.18s]  I slipped my finger open.
[583.98s -> 586.01s]  It was a disaster.
[586.73s -> 587.38s]  All right.
[587.38s -> 587.86s]  Let me...
[587.86s -> 588.26s]  Hold on.
[588.26s -> 590.26s]  Before we get started, I gotta fix this.
[590.26s -> 591.90s]  Like shit.
[592.78s -> 595.00s]  Give me that back.
[601.50s -> 602.78s]  Auto-focus is on too.
[602.78s -> 604.06s]  What the fuck is this bullshit?
[605.10s -> 612.31s]  How do people...
[612.31s -> 612.71s]  How does it...
[620.63s -> 621.83s]  White balance is wrong too.
[628.62s -> 629.10s]  It's fine.
[629.10s -> 629.50s]  Whatever.
[629.50s -> 630.22s]  Like I don't care.
[631.18s -> 632.46s]  When I turn to the side, you're gonna see.
[633.42s -> 635.10s]  Like this is what it's gonna be like.
[635.82s -> 636.94s]  So what the fuck do I care?
[637.90s -> 639.26s]  And I know it looks like somebody like...
[639.26s -> 641.90s]  Put like melted chocolate on my head.
[641.90s -> 643.02s]  But that's just the way it is.
[643.02s -> 643.90s]  And that's the way it's gonna be.
[645.10s -> 646.82s]  Somebody just gave a huge amount of money.
[649.66s -> 651.02s]  Somebody's just like just...
[651.02s -> 653.42s]  This is like a cake decoration here.
[653.42s -> 653.98s]  I get it.
[653.98s -> 654.30s]  I know.
[654.94s -> 655.98s]  You don't think I look in the mirror
[655.98s -> 657.82s]  and don't think I see like a decorated cake?
[658.70s -> 663.37s]  Anyways, we had a lot of money just come in.
[663.37s -> 663.77s]  We had...
[664.65s -> 665.94s]  How much did we just have come in?
[666.98s -> 668.74s]  10,000 bits just came in.
[670.95s -> 671.83s]  By West.
[672.47s -> 676.55s]  West 095 just gave a fucking hundred bucks.
[676.55s -> 677.19s]  And they don't...
[677.19s -> 677.43s]  This...
[677.43s -> 677.99s]  They don't...
[677.99s -> 678.63s]  There's nothing here.
[678.63s -> 680.15s]  It's just a hundred dollars.
[680.15s -> 681.19s]  It's just a hundred dollars.
[681.75s -> 683.11s]  It's a huge amount of fucking money.
[683.11s -> 683.75s]  Thank you, West.
[686.71s -> 687.27s]  Thank you.
[687.27s -> 689.43s]  Bad Nutrition 5 Community Subs as well.
[689.43s -> 690.79s]  You guys are just giving me money.
[690.79s -> 692.07s]  And anybody even here?
[692.07s -> 693.59s]  There's zero viewers right now.
[693.59s -> 695.08s]  And nobody even here.
[695.08s -> 697.77s]  How can I know reliably that people are actually even here?
[698.73s -> 699.69s]  Like how am I supposed to...
[699.69s -> 700.89s]  How am I supposed to determine with my...
[700.89s -> 702.01s]  What my analytics look like?
[705.46s -> 706.42s]  Lip cream hair.
[707.06s -> 709.40s]  All right.
[709.40s -> 709.96s]  Let's get started.
[710.68s -> 713.86s]  I'm going to shrink myself a little bit.
[714.50s -> 716.81s]  Nobody...
[716.81s -> 718.41s]  There's another hundred fucking dollars.
[719.30s -> 721.22s]  A hundred more dollars.
[721.22s -> 722.58s]  This is like five...
[722.58s -> 726.42s]  This is like four or five hundred dollars in 15 minutes.
[727.51s -> 728.23s]  Holy shit.
[728.23s -> 728.47s]  Okay.
[728.47s -> 728.71s]  That's...
[730.15s -> 730.63s]  Boz...
[732.22s -> 732.62s]  Boz...
[733.58s -> 734.22s]  Bertlar.
[734.78s -> 736.94s]  Boz Bertlar gave a hundred dollars.
[737.82s -> 738.70s]  Greetings from Sweden.
[738.70s -> 740.38s]  Hello from the United States of America.
[740.38s -> 741.58s]  Specifically, the Las Vegas.
[743.02s -> 745.11s]  Now they say long time viewer, first time donator.
[745.11s -> 746.63s]  Oh, and also play Yakuza Zero.
[746.63s -> 747.11s]  I already did.
[747.11s -> 751.19s]  And I gave up on it because I have the attention span of a fucking eight-year-old.
[752.38s -> 754.46s]  But thanks for the huge amount of fucking money.
[754.46s -> 756.28s]  All right.
[756.28s -> 759.24s]  We got our first Joe Joe's Bizarre Adventure reference.
[760.20s -> 760.84s]  Hey, Tona.
[760.84s -> 761.88s]  Thanks for the 10 subs.
[761.88s -> 762.12s]  Yeah.
[762.12s -> 762.52s]  I'll just...
[762.52s -> 764.44s]  I'll just bring it at five hundred dollars.
[765.53s -> 766.33s]  Holy shit, guys.
[766.97s -> 768.94s]  You're out of your minds.
[768.94s -> 771.51s]  We got Glue Man and the Rat.
[772.23s -> 773.51s]  And of course, yeah, in the background.
[773.51s -> 774.55s]  This is very well done.
[774.55s -> 776.95s]  Not to say the last one wasn't well done.
[776.95s -> 778.15s]  But this one's very good.
[778.79s -> 780.52s]  But on clown music.
[781.16s -> 785.99s]  What do you mean clown music?
[785.99s -> 791.66s]  Oh, no, the Rat got confirmed for Smash.
[792.30s -> 798.33s]  Clown, clown, clown, clown.
[798.33s -> 799.61s]  I don't...
[799.61s -> 800.33s]  Clown...
[800.33s -> 800.81s]  I don't get it.
[801.37s -> 804.94s]  What is clown OST?
[804.94s -> 805.74s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[806.54s -> 808.46s]  Clown OST.
[809.82s -> 812.50s]  The first thing that comes up is the Joker movie.
[812.50s -> 816.81s]  There's no clown OST.
[818.09s -> 819.85s]  A clown doesn't have a CD that he puts in
[819.85s -> 822.01s]  when he goes and does balloon animals at your house.
[822.73s -> 823.61s]  By the way, I got to like...
[824.49s -> 826.52s]  I got to get a little close to this microphone
[826.52s -> 827.08s]  so you can hear me.
[827.08s -> 829.48s]  We got to change where the webcam is too.
[829.48s -> 829.96s]  All right, there we go.
[831.08s -> 831.72s]  All right, what's what?
[831.72s -> 832.60s]  Clown OST.
[833.96s -> 834.84s]  I don't get it.
[835.40s -> 841.35s]  I'm not putting on the Joker.
[841.35s -> 842.31s]  I haven't seen that movie.
[842.95s -> 845.06s]  Play clown music.
[845.78s -> 847.61s]  I don't even know what you taught.
[847.61s -> 849.21s]  What is that even supposed to mean?
[849.21s -> 849.85s]  Clown...
[849.85s -> 851.05s]  One hour of...
[851.05s -> 851.93s]  I'm not putting...
[851.93s -> 855.16s]  No, circus theme song for 10 hours.
[855.80s -> 858.95s]  It's even lined up, really.
[858.95s -> 861.53s]  I got to get out of the way
[861.53s -> 862.49s]  so you can see the whole picture.
[869.40s -> 869.88s]  Do it.
[869.88s -> 873.77s]  I don't want to just put on fucking clown music.
[879.48s -> 881.08s]  No, I'm not going to keep this on.
[881.08s -> 882.12s]  This is fucking stupid.
[883.00s -> 883.80s]  How about just like...
[884.52s -> 886.89s]  One hour of scary clown music.
[887.77s -> 889.77s]  One hour of creepy clown music.
[895.94s -> 898.90s]  45 minutes of classic circus music.
[898.90s -> 899.86s]  I think I've already played this.
[902.33s -> 905.02s]  Yeah, yeah, I've played this before.
[906.14s -> 912.41s]  Okay, I'm going to do this as long as I can possibly handle this.
[912.41s -> 913.21s]  But that's it.
[913.93s -> 915.54s]  But this is fantastic, though.
[915.54s -> 916.02s]  Nice work.
[920.20s -> 921.40s]  Ah, this is scary.
[921.96s -> 923.45s]  It's me.
[923.45s -> 925.21s]  Looks like I've got a knife in my hand.
[930.14s -> 930.38s]  I...
[930.94s -> 934.26s]  Why is it happening twice again?
[935.83s -> 936.87s]  Why is this happening?
[936.87s -> 937.83s]  I changed my thing.
[940.55s -> 940.87s]  That's...
[941.75s -> 942.31s]  Hello?
[942.31s -> 943.19s]  What the fuck?
[943.19s -> 947.13s]  Okay, hold on.
[947.13s -> 948.55s]  Here we go.
[950.65s -> 954.30s]  There we are.
[954.30s -> 956.41s]  Now we got some real clown music going.
[959.37s -> 960.33s]  I like the knife.
[960.33s -> 962.65s]  I like the knife work that you've got here.
[963.37s -> 967.75s]  We can't hear it.
[970.17s -> 970.81s]  Yes, you can.
[970.81s -> 975.19s]  What's going on up here?
[975.19s -> 975.83s]  Is this blood?
[976.55s -> 977.59s]  Oh, I...
[977.59s -> 977.83s]  Why?
[977.83s -> 978.55s]  How do I not...
[978.55s -> 979.43s]  This is the spy.
[979.43s -> 980.63s]  That's your eternal reward.
[980.63s -> 981.59s]  How do I not know this?
[984.06s -> 985.10s]  It was disguised.
[985.10s -> 985.42s]  Okay.
[986.06s -> 986.78s]  I don't know why.
[986.78s -> 988.22s]  I'm so fucking dumb.
[988.22s -> 990.07s]  I'm a fool.
[990.07s -> 990.39s]  I know.
[991.11s -> 993.11s]  Ah, this is somebody...
[993.11s -> 995.51s]  Somebody had a birthday or somebody had a...
[996.63s -> 997.03s]  All right.
[997.03s -> 997.59s]  Somebody had a...
[997.59s -> 999.67s]  There was a baby involved or something.
[999.67s -> 1001.03s]  There was a baby reveal.
[1001.03s -> 1001.43s]  I don't know.
[1002.07s -> 1006.76s]  But this is...
[1006.76s -> 1007.32s]  That's a joke.
[1007.32s -> 1007.96s]  Wait, that's from the...
[1008.68s -> 1015.13s]  I don't...
[1015.13s -> 1016.73s]  I've never said I haven't seen the movie.
[1017.61s -> 1019.37s]  This is a joker of game?
[1019.37s -> 1020.01s]  It's a game.
[1020.73s -> 1023.64s]  This is a good image.
[1023.64s -> 1023.88s]  You got...
[1023.88s -> 1024.28s]  Hey, look.
[1024.84s -> 1029.22s]  Those of you that don't know,
[1031.06s -> 1032.74s]  I don't wear two headphones
[1033.30s -> 1034.90s]  because when I cover both my ears,
[1034.90s -> 1036.18s]  I don't know where I am.
[1036.90s -> 1039.14s]  And it fucks with my spatial awareness.
[1039.14s -> 1039.54s]  When I...
[1039.54s -> 1041.30s]  I say I can't hear myself talk right now.
[1041.86s -> 1044.02s]  And me not being able to hear myself talk right now
[1044.66s -> 1046.50s]  is being drowned out by like clown music.
[1047.14s -> 1049.70s]  So it's like when a vacuum cleaner is on
[1049.70s -> 1050.34s]  and you're talking,
[1051.88s -> 1052.92s]  I can't do it.
[1052.92s -> 1053.40s]  I can't do it.
[1053.40s -> 1054.20s]  I have to be able to hear...
[1054.20s -> 1056.76s]  I have to be able to hear and sense the surroundings.
[1056.76s -> 1058.52s]  Otherwise, I lose my mind.
[1060.36s -> 1061.56s]  But no, this is pretty accurate.
[1062.42s -> 1063.62s]  Yo, that's the old hair too.
[1064.63s -> 1065.43s]  All right.
[1065.43s -> 1066.47s]  One in the chat,
[1066.47s -> 1067.99s]  if you want me to go back to short,
[1069.19s -> 1070.87s]  free Vegas hair.
[1070.87s -> 1074.66s]  Who in the chat if you want me to let this grow
[1075.38s -> 1077.62s]  and don't cut it for at least three years?
[1084.62s -> 1086.94s]  Eh, I've seen a lot of ones.
[1087.58s -> 1091.54s]  Or three is shave it off.
[1093.24s -> 1095.08s]  I can't listen to that song a fourth time.
[1095.08s -> 1095.48s]  I'm sorry.
[1095.48s -> 1095.96s]  We have to do something.
[1095.96s -> 1096.92s]  We have to put something else on.
[1098.60s -> 1100.54s]  Yoshi's.
[1100.54s -> 1100.94s]  What was it?
[1100.94s -> 1101.82s]  Yoshi's story.
[1101.82s -> 1102.54s]  We keep going.
[1102.54s -> 1105.42s]  We always go back to like Yoshi's Island.
[1105.42s -> 1108.66s]  To a pole.
[1108.66s -> 1109.46s]  No, no, no.
[1109.46s -> 1110.10s]  I'm not going to be like,
[1110.10s -> 1111.22s]  oh, should I cut my hair?
[1111.22s -> 1113.22s]  Should I dye it fucking orange
[1113.22s -> 1114.74s]  or should I cut it off?
[1114.74s -> 1115.94s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1115.94s -> 1117.30s]  I'm going to decide what I'm...
[1117.30s -> 1118.58s]  Cut my finger by the way today.
[1118.58s -> 1119.70s]  Of course you see that.
[1119.70s -> 1121.93s]  To a mohawk.
[1121.93s -> 1122.43s]  No.
[1122.89s -> 1126.41s]  Why did you ask?
[1127.13s -> 1129.75s]  I just...
[1129.75s -> 1131.03s]  I was just seeing what people thought.
[1132.15s -> 1135.69s]  I said, hey, one in chat if you think.
[1135.69s -> 1136.65s]  Two in chat if you think.
[1137.37s -> 1138.17s]  But what you...
[1138.17s -> 1139.21s]  It's what I think though.
[1139.21s -> 1140.01s]  Because it's my hair.
[1140.57s -> 1141.85s]  I was just curious to see how many people
[1141.85s -> 1142.65s]  would be angry with it.
[1143.21s -> 1150.14s]  Jerma doesn't think.
[1150.70s -> 1151.99s]  All right.
[1151.99s -> 1153.43s]  We're going to do Yoshi's.
[1153.43s -> 1154.63s]  Yoshi's story.
[1155.51s -> 1156.63s]  What's the one for Nintendo 64
[1156.63s -> 1157.83s]  where they sing like little kids?
[1158.71s -> 1159.11s]  They go...
[1162.17s -> 1163.13s]  Where is it?
[1163.13s -> 1163.93s]  It's horrendous.
[1165.05s -> 1165.53s]  Here it comes.
[1166.33s -> 1170.20s]  I remember playing this when I was younger.
[1171.24s -> 1171.96s]  When I was younger,
[1171.96s -> 1173.24s]  it wasn't that long ago but it was.
[1174.12s -> 1176.44s]  And it's this ear piercing like...
[1178.44s -> 1179.88s]  I'm telling you it's horrible.
[1179.88s -> 1180.36s]  Where is it?
[1182.50s -> 1182.82s]  No.
[1183.75s -> 1184.31s]  Not this one.
[1188.78s -> 1189.26s]  Where is it?
[1190.62s -> 1190.86s]  It's...
[1190.86s -> 1191.98s]  Then they say the end.
[1194.55s -> 1196.95s]  The end of...
[1198.39s -> 1201.11s]  The end of...
[1201.11s -> 1202.23s]  Like it's the end of the story.
[1203.19s -> 1204.06s]  What's it called?
[1214.71s -> 1215.67s]  How come I can't find it?
[1215.67s -> 1218.26s]  Nintendo.
[1218.34s -> 1218.90s]  On the beach.
[1219.54s -> 1220.42s]  Love is in the air.
[1221.22s -> 1222.66s]  Tough guys don't cry.
[1222.66s -> 1223.78s]  What's that one?
[1223.78s -> 1237.46s]  It's the rat found in the sewer.
[1238.26s -> 1239.46s]  The small enemy spider.
[1242.36s -> 1243.16s]  That's supposed to be me?
[1246.55s -> 1248.15s]  Chad is a cutie.
[1248.15s -> 1249.11s]  Is that supposed to be you?
[1251.46s -> 1253.22s]  The garbage-filled baby arms
[1253.22s -> 1256.18s]  are because I drew on one layer unintentionally.
[1256.18s -> 1257.86s]  Didn't want to start over like a dum-dum.
[1258.50s -> 1259.82s]  What's wrong with it?
[1259.82s -> 1260.14s]  It's fine.
[1262.66s -> 1263.14s]  What's wrong with it?
[1263.14s -> 1263.62s]  It looks good.
[1264.26s -> 1265.99s]  I think it looks good.
[1266.47s -> 1273.91s]  Trust no one, not even yourself.
[1280.01s -> 1281.45s]  This is just my regular clothes.
[1282.25s -> 1288.31s]  I wear like the same three superhero shirts
[1288.31s -> 1289.11s]  and then like a few...
[1289.11s -> 1290.71s]  A handful of Star Wars shirts.
[1295.35s -> 1297.51s]  Jax has a way better fashion sense as you can see.
[1298.39s -> 1300.41s]  He's got a Nightwing shirt on.
[1301.05s -> 1301.45s]  That's it.
[1302.17s -> 1302.89s]  Wow.
[1303.93s -> 1305.69s]  Also a superhero shirt.
[1305.69s -> 1310.54s]  Do I have any real clothes?
[1310.54s -> 1312.14s]  I do, but they just all...
[1312.14s -> 1312.46s]  Okay.
[1313.34s -> 1314.95s]  I have real clothes,
[1314.95s -> 1318.15s]  but they're all hung up on hangers
[1318.15s -> 1320.15s]  and I don't ever take them off the hangers
[1320.15s -> 1322.55s]  because it's way easier just to put a t-shirt on
[1322.55s -> 1325.19s]  than it is to like put a button-up shirt with like a tie on.
[1325.91s -> 1329.77s]  Prove it.
[1329.77s -> 1332.02s]  Prove that I have real clothes?
[1333.14s -> 1338.46s]  No, it has nothing to do with going to Reddit.
[1338.46s -> 1339.26s]  It has to do with...
[1339.26s -> 1339.66s]  I don't...
[1340.54s -> 1341.34s]  I like having...
[1342.30s -> 1342.94s]  It's comfy.
[1344.22s -> 1344.90s]  Do it.
[1344.90s -> 1346.18s]  Let's do a fashion show.
[1347.38s -> 1348.34s]  Hold that thought.
[1348.34s -> 1351.14s]  We got community fucking content tonight.
[1351.14s -> 1352.34s]  Although it's kind of still the day.
[1352.74s -> 1353.54s]  I'll prove it.
[1353.54s -> 1353.86s]  I will.
[1354.90s -> 1356.02s]  Life imitates art.
[1356.58s -> 1368.22s]  It sure does.
[1370.39s -> 1371.35s]  Jerma and Jax.
[1373.80s -> 1374.84s]  Pretty cool dudes here.
[1375.48s -> 1384.28s]  Is this it?
[1384.28s -> 1387.03s]  No.
[1387.03s -> 1387.91s]  I thought that was going to be it.
[1387.91s -> 1388.63s]  I was waiting for it.
[1389.67s -> 1391.51s]  Well, there's Jax and Jerma.
[1391.51s -> 1392.95s]  We're both not the same person.
[1392.95s -> 1393.67s]  We both have different...
[1394.71s -> 1395.99s]  We're both different people, I guess.
[1396.63s -> 1397.91s]  I skipped it already.
[1397.91s -> 1398.87s]  How is that even possible?
[1400.60s -> 1401.56s]  By the way, take this out.
[1401.56s -> 1402.28s]  I can't even...
[1402.28s -> 1403.40s]  I can't even hear myself talk.
[1404.04s -> 1405.16s]  I need no headphones.
[1405.96s -> 1408.76s]  You know, I know people that put both headphones in
[1408.76s -> 1410.52s]  and pump their audio through,
[1410.52s -> 1411.64s]  so they hear themselves talking.
[1412.52s -> 1413.80s]  I would throw up if I had to do that.
[1414.44s -> 1415.48s]  I would actually throw up.
[1416.44s -> 1417.00s]  Like, I would...
[1418.76s -> 1419.72s]  It would never work.
[1420.28s -> 1421.16s]  It would be impossible.
[1422.98s -> 1424.18s]  This looks like a sticker to me.
[1424.18s -> 1425.56s]  Looks very good.
[1425.56s -> 1429.26s]  The big thick outlines.
[1429.26s -> 1432.09s]  I like it.
[1432.09s -> 1434.65s]  I would love this on the back of a laptop.
[1434.65s -> 1438.06s]  Get your laptop.
[1439.18s -> 1439.82s]  I think it would look good.
[1440.38s -> 1441.27s]  It would look good.
[1442.47s -> 1443.27s]  Like a Redditor.
[1444.55s -> 1447.19s]  Not everything is...
[1448.71s -> 1450.23s]  You guys are on that recently.
[1450.23s -> 1450.95s]  I don't understand.
[1451.83s -> 1456.63s]  Not everything is based on a news aggregate website.
[1462.26s -> 1463.54s]  How come you guys aren't like...
[1463.54s -> 1463.94s]  Oh, wow.
[1463.94s -> 1465.38s]  That's a real CNN thing to do.
[1466.34s -> 1467.06s]  Oh, wow.
[1467.06s -> 1468.02s]  NBC streamer.
[1469.21s -> 1470.41s]  Nice NBC room.
[1472.20s -> 1473.64s]  I get my news from Reddit.
[1473.64s -> 1477.40s]  I read the headlines and see and go to articles on Reddit.
[1478.04s -> 1479.96s]  That's like calling me an NBC guy.
[1480.60s -> 1481.16s]  Or like a...
[1481.16s -> 1481.56s]  Wow, man.
[1481.56s -> 1483.40s]  That's what a real NBC thing to do, huh?
[1483.40s -> 1484.04s]  Oh, yeah.
[1484.04s -> 1485.48s]  I'm going to have a laptop with a sticker on it.
[1485.48s -> 1486.60s]  What are you, fucking CNN?
[1487.56s -> 1489.80s]  I just only go to Reddit for news.
[1493.51s -> 1494.55s]  That explains a lot.
[1494.55s -> 1495.27s]  No, it doesn't.
[1495.27s -> 1495.75s]  I don't even...
[1495.75s -> 1497.03s]  Guys, I don't even watch TV.
[1498.07s -> 1499.27s]  I don't even watch TV.
[1500.31s -> 1501.96s]  I don't watch television.
[1501.96s -> 1503.48s]  I don't listen to music.
[1503.48s -> 1504.68s]  I'm just a fucking weirdo.
[1504.68s -> 1506.36s]  I just sit in a room and stare at a wall.
[1506.92s -> 1508.12s]  I just go like this.
[1508.12s -> 1511.08s]  Wow, I make up my own TV shows.
[1511.16s -> 1512.20s]  I like my own characters.
[1512.20s -> 1514.12s]  And I let them do their own things in my head.
[1514.68s -> 1518.39s]  I just said that to everybody.
[1520.34s -> 1521.22s]  This is pretty scary.
[1522.86s -> 1523.58s]  You're a psycho?
[1523.58s -> 1525.26s]  No, it's called free entertainment.
[1525.90s -> 1532.97s]  I can't wait to the next episode of two alligators.
[1532.97s -> 1534.73s]  Because that's the thing I dreamed last night.
[1534.73s -> 1535.53s]  Two alligators.
[1536.81s -> 1537.37s]  Made that up.
[1538.52s -> 1538.92s]  I did.
[1539.48s -> 1539.80s]  I did.
[1540.62s -> 1541.02s]  Yeah.
[1541.02s -> 1541.50s]  Good call.
[1541.50s -> 1541.90s]  Good catch.
[1549.05s -> 1550.73s]  Two and a half alligators.
[1553.40s -> 1554.60s]  This is scary.
[1554.60s -> 1556.58s]  I like the background, though.
[1556.58s -> 1562.86s]  Looks good.
[1562.86s -> 1564.14s]  Big screaming mouth.
[1564.94s -> 1565.90s]  Look at this guy.
[1565.90s -> 1566.14s]  Yeah.
[1566.86s -> 1570.71s]  Why are people saying sour please?
[1570.71s -> 1571.11s]  What is it?
[1571.11s -> 1572.07s]  I don't want to miss out.
[1572.71s -> 1573.19s]  What is it?
[1580.89s -> 1582.81s]  Why are we sour pleasing the language?
[1582.81s -> 1584.17s]  Sneaking around music.
[1584.17s -> 1584.81s]  That's what this is.
[1584.81s -> 1586.17s]  This is the evil guy.
[1586.17s -> 1587.85s]  It's sneaking around corners.
[1587.85s -> 1588.57s]  This is like the...
[1588.57s -> 1588.97s]  Hold on.
[1592.52s -> 1593.48s]  This is this music.
[1593.48s -> 1593.80s]  All righty?
[1593.80s -> 1595.24s]  Like I'm going to come in frame.
[1596.28s -> 1616.46s]  Where's the end?
[1617.18s -> 1619.10s]  985.
[1619.10s -> 1620.54s]  A story of a madman.
[1621.66s -> 1628.25s]  Now that was another good internet clown moment.
[1628.89s -> 1629.85s]  Thank you.
[1630.49s -> 1632.55s]  I'm not even...
[1632.55s -> 1633.67s]  These are all like jokes.
[1634.55s -> 1635.74s]  All right.
[1635.74s -> 1636.86s]  I can't hear myself breathe.
[1637.50s -> 1639.00s]  These are all like jokes.
[1639.00s -> 1639.72s]  I'm not a madman.
[1639.72s -> 1640.20s]  This is okay.
[1640.20s -> 1640.92s]  This is a character.
[1640.92s -> 1641.80s]  This is Odd Michael.
[1642.44s -> 1646.12s]  This is me crying and laughing at a fart compilation.
[1646.12s -> 1646.60s]  So that's me.
[1647.32s -> 1648.36s]  That's also me.
[1650.62s -> 1651.18s]  That's not even me.
[1651.18s -> 1652.14s]  That's Jex.
[1652.14s -> 1654.71s]  That's a TIE fighter guy.
[1654.71s -> 1655.93s]  That's a clown.
[1655.93s -> 1656.49s]  That's not even me.
[1656.49s -> 1657.05s]  That's a clown.
[1657.05s -> 1659.05s]  And then this is a ninja turtle.
[1659.61s -> 1660.46s]  So sorry.
[1660.46s -> 1660.94s]  These are all...
[1660.94s -> 1662.06s]  These are characters.
[1662.06s -> 1664.62s]  What's that old saying?
[1664.62s -> 1666.62s]  I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV.
[1666.62s -> 1667.32s]  This is...
[1667.32s -> 1668.28s]  These are characters of mine.
[1668.28s -> 1669.24s]  This is not me.
[1669.24s -> 1672.87s]  Socrates.
[1673.83s -> 1674.87s]  You're a character.
[1674.87s -> 1678.42s]  Post fart.
[1678.42s -> 1679.78s]  Thanks for the five subs.
[1679.78s -> 1682.62s]  Oh, so you're a scientist.
[1682.62s -> 1684.66s]  No, I'm not a scientist.
[1684.66s -> 1685.54s]  I love this.
[1685.54s -> 1687.26s]  This is great.
[1689.77s -> 1691.38s]  Getting defensive.
[1694.26s -> 1694.82s]  Not really.
[1700.30s -> 1702.06s]  He's really happy about something.
[1702.06s -> 1704.60s]  And I do appreciate the big ding on the teeth.
[1704.60s -> 1706.44s]  I like the ding.
[1711.00s -> 1711.40s]  Whatever.
[1711.40s -> 1712.28s]  I don't even know what the song is.
[1715.61s -> 1717.93s]  Here's some Dunky Donut because you're epic.
[1717.93s -> 1719.05s]  That really took off, too.
[1721.37s -> 1723.13s]  This Dunkin' Donuts thing.
[1723.13s -> 1728.47s]  Isn't this like a meme from somebody else?
[1728.47s -> 1729.83s]  This is like another meme, right?
[1731.19s -> 1733.46s]  This is like...
[1734.42s -> 1736.50s]  We've adapted.
[1736.50s -> 1738.90s]  We've taken over and adapted the meme.
[1738.90s -> 1745.13s]  Oh, I didn't, but this is a Reddit meme.
[1745.13s -> 1747.37s]  No, it's not.
[1747.37s -> 1752.95s]  It's not...
[1752.95s -> 1753.35s]  No, it's not.
[1753.35s -> 1753.91s]  It's not mine.
[1755.74s -> 1756.14s]  Nothing.
[1756.14s -> 1757.02s]  None of this is mine.
[1757.02s -> 1757.98s]  This is all yours.
[1757.98s -> 1759.26s]  This is community content night.
[1759.26s -> 1761.18s]  I almost just burped because it was loud in the microphone.
[1765.86s -> 1768.66s]  Told you how I got this cut from a hummus.
[1770.26s -> 1773.78s]  When you eat a lot of hummus, it can boil back up.
[1773.78s -> 1778.31s]  It can be like gas because of all the hummus gas.
[1778.95s -> 1780.63s]  So I'm not a scientist.
[1780.63s -> 1784.14s]  I don't watch any news.
[1784.14s -> 1784.62s]  No, I do.
[1785.75s -> 1791.66s]  This is interesting because this person is Tony Hawk's underground.
[1791.66s -> 1794.55s]  And they've decided to use that.
[1796.02s -> 1807.11s]  This is the image that all of us have when our parents took the picture of us on our
[1807.11s -> 1808.55s]  first day of school in first grade.
[1812.20s -> 1817.91s]  In fact, I could probably ask my mother to send me the picture of this exact thing I'm
[1817.91s -> 1818.47s]  talking about.
[1820.47s -> 1821.43s]  Even the stance too.
[1821.43s -> 1822.63s]  The only thing is at a backpack.
[1825.90s -> 1827.10s]  With huge shoes.
[1827.66s -> 1829.50s]  They are.
[1829.50s -> 1831.96s]  They are fucking huge, aren't they?
[1838.28s -> 1840.52s]  Oh my god.
[1840.52s -> 1841.08s]  All right.
[1841.08s -> 1845.26s]  I wasn't going to include this, but I just did it anyways.
[1845.26s -> 1849.98s]  I was going to just remove this one, but it's just, it's stupid.
[1849.98s -> 1851.34s]  I just had to put it in.
[1852.14s -> 1855.83s]  Here is, uh, I believe that's fireman.
[1855.83s -> 1858.78s]  Clown shoes.
[1859.58s -> 1864.94s]  I don't, I know everything has to be clown related.
[1864.94s -> 1867.34s]  Why can everything not be clown related?
[1867.34s -> 1867.98s]  EOS.
[1867.98s -> 1868.38s]  What?
[1873.74s -> 1879.66s]  For a second, I thought it was going to be a dick and it was a clown.
[1879.98s -> 1882.38s]  I'm like, no, this is what you're talking about.
[1883.86s -> 1884.82s]  Are links still banned?
[1884.82s -> 1885.78s]  I think they are.
[1885.78s -> 1892.33s]  It's a clown reddit Jojo.
[1892.33s -> 1893.77s]  Anime villain goblin face.
[1893.77s -> 1896.39s]  This is from, uh, sins.
[1896.39s -> 1896.87s]  I know.
[1902.74s -> 1903.70s]  Saw this last time.
[1904.90s -> 1909.24s]  Fucking like this so much.
[1909.24s -> 1910.76s]  It's going to be my new profile picture.
[1914.76s -> 1918.44s]  Should this just be the profile, my profile picture?
[1923.45s -> 1927.19s]  I feel like that's not going to help me though.
[1927.19s -> 1927.59s]  Anywhere.
[1928.15s -> 1932.22s]  It would be the other one.
[1933.22s -> 1933.46s]  No.
[1934.26s -> 1935.74s]  Are my eyes close together?
[1936.38s -> 1937.51s]  They kind of are.
[1941.86s -> 1943.06s]  Yeah, kind of, but not.
[1943.06s -> 1946.98s]  No, it's because I just got a, I got a big broken fucked up nose.
[1950.84s -> 1954.60s]  My like big ridge of my nose makes my eyes look closer together.
[1957.29s -> 1962.97s]  If I didn't have like a big like squidward schnoz, but I just, I would, it would be fine.
[1965.27s -> 1965.99s]  Bad music.
[1973.51s -> 1975.59s]  Oh, that's why everyone was doing that emo.
[1980.10s -> 1983.38s]  Hey, I thought you were saying that's what I looked like.
[1984.10s -> 1985.32s]  I thought it was.
[1985.32s -> 1985.56s]  Yeah.
[1985.56s -> 1986.92s]  You look like this character.
[1986.92s -> 1987.24s]  Oh yeah.
[1987.24s -> 1989.24s]  Like your eyes are too close together and your nose is too big.
[1989.24s -> 1993.80s]  You look like an orc streamer.
[1993.80s -> 1994.20s]  God.
[1996.60s -> 1997.24s]  It's both.
[1997.88s -> 2002.12s]  Hold the music for a second.
[2002.12s -> 2004.36s]  We had two huge donations coming.
[2004.36s -> 2007.32s]  We had 5,000 bits from West.
[2007.32s -> 2008.20s]  Oh nine five.
[2009.00s -> 2010.76s]  They say I forgot the message.
[2010.76s -> 2012.12s]  So here's more bits.
[2013.00s -> 2014.95s]  Thanks for the years of entertainment.
[2014.95s -> 2017.27s]  Watched you since I was in like seventh grade.
[2017.99s -> 2019.03s]  That's so long.
[2019.03s -> 2019.83s]  I'm so old.
[2020.55s -> 2022.66s]  And I'm currently in college.
[2022.66s -> 2024.10s]  God, that makes me fucking old.
[2024.74s -> 2028.81s]  That makes me, that makes me ancient.
[2030.97s -> 2033.13s]  Thanks so much for making a lot of otherwise boring days.
[2033.13s -> 2034.65s]  Not boring, especially in a time like this.
[2034.65s -> 2035.69s]  Well, thanks for the $50.
[2038.50s -> 2040.82s]  I'm incredibly happy to have raised you.
[2041.54s -> 2045.78s]  My son, you're in the seventh, you're in the seventh grade.
[2049.58s -> 2051.74s]  You see your kids get all off to college.
[2052.95s -> 2054.63s]  You speak such a big boy now.
[2055.27s -> 2059.58s]  But seriously, thank you.
[2060.57s -> 2062.17s]  Thanks for the $50.
[2062.17s -> 2063.77s]  Thanks for watching for that long.
[2063.77s -> 2067.90s]  We also had another 5,000 bits come in.
[2067.90s -> 2069.58s]  $50 from a big boy.
[2071.34s -> 2072.54s]  She's gotten so big.
[2072.54s -> 2073.34s]  My big boy.
[2073.34s -> 2074.62s]  I didn't even read that.
[2074.62s -> 2076.14s]  A big boy Ego.
[2077.66s -> 2079.10s]  Germany streams mean a whole lot to me
[2079.10s -> 2082.06s]  and have made me smile during some really harsh times.
[2082.06s -> 2084.22s]  Hope you're doing well and I hope you have a nice day.
[2084.22s -> 2087.18s]  Also, please make a sequel to Demon Lord Freddy's.
[2087.18s -> 2092.95s]  I can't adhere to that request.
[2093.99s -> 2094.63s]  I can't do that.
[2097.77s -> 2098.25s]  I can't.
[2099.45s -> 2100.46s]  I can't.
[2100.46s -> 2101.50s]  That's like that's...
[2101.50s -> 2102.22s]  I know people say,
[2102.22s -> 2103.66s]  Jeremy, that video is not even that bad.
[2103.66s -> 2104.46s]  You're overreacting.
[2105.85s -> 2106.65s]  I know.
[2106.65s -> 2108.49s]  But they'll never...
[2108.49s -> 2108.99s]  No.
[2112.76s -> 2114.20s]  Need to return that money then.
[2118.86s -> 2119.42s]  No.
[2119.42s -> 2120.86s]  All sales are final.
[2121.93s -> 2123.53s]  All sales are final.
[2123.53s -> 2125.99s]  Speaking of sales, thanks Super Bruce.
[2125.99s -> 2127.59s]  Oh, Super Bruce.
[2127.59s -> 2128.63s]  Super Frog Bruce.
[2129.19s -> 2130.55s]  Thanks for the five community subs.
[2132.30s -> 2134.06s]  Is that written down anywhere by the way?
[2134.06s -> 2135.90s]  Do I say all sales are final anywhere?
[2138.12s -> 2138.76s]  Probably should.
[2139.96s -> 2144.70s]  But anyways, that's $50 from two different people.
[2144.70s -> 2146.62s]  Thank you West and thank you big boy.
[2146.62s -> 2147.42s]  Both of you.
[2147.42s -> 2151.42s]  And thanks Super Frog for those five community subs.
[2152.82s -> 2153.22s]  Keep going.
[2153.22s -> 2154.58s]  Let's put that fucking music back on.
[2155.30s -> 2156.42s]  Can I find the end thing?
[2157.30s -> 2158.79s]  Is this it?
[2159.91s -> 2169.19s]  Guys, I think they omitted this because it was so annoying.
[2174.30s -> 2175.98s]  Yoshi's Story, the end.
[2175.98s -> 2176.70s]  It's not on here.
[2183.69s -> 2184.65s]  No, they removed it.
[2185.37s -> 2186.25s]  Nobody has it anywhere.
[2187.72s -> 2188.60s]  The end of...
[2192.10s -> 2193.14s]  End credits music?
[2195.19s -> 2196.47s]  No, it's been removed.
[2200.36s -> 2201.48s]  Another 10 subs.
[2201.48s -> 2203.24s]  Harold Albertson, 985.
[2203.24s -> 2207.40s]  Thanks, thanks me for the 10 community subs.
[2207.96s -> 2209.26s]  Thank you, Harold.
[2210.06s -> 2214.17s]  That's 10 subs.
[2214.17s -> 2214.97s]  Where the fuck is this?
[2215.53s -> 2217.35s]  A book opens.
[2217.91s -> 2218.79s]  It's the intro.
[2218.79s -> 2219.75s]  I had the right song?
[2224.23s -> 2236.20s]  No, it's not.
[2241.67s -> 2242.23s]  I have no idea.
[2243.11s -> 2245.77s]  I can't stop worrying about the song.
[2246.89s -> 2248.09s]  This fucking picture.
[2248.09s -> 2248.73s]  Look at this shit.
[2248.73s -> 2249.21s]  Look at how...
[2249.21s -> 2250.57s]  This is fucking...
[2250.57s -> 2251.45s]  I want to be this.
[2253.00s -> 2254.20s]  I want to be this.
[2254.20s -> 2254.68s]  So bad.
[2256.20s -> 2260.01s]  Officer Jack's Space Police.
[2262.31s -> 2264.15s]  This is so detailed.
[2264.15s -> 2264.39s]  Big...
[2274.38s -> 2275.18s]  I cannot be...
[2275.90s -> 2278.22s]  Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2278.22s -> 2279.18s]  I don't want to talk about that.
[2279.18s -> 2279.66s]  That's just...
[2284.44s -> 2287.16s]  Let's zoom in on that face for a minute here.
[2290.98s -> 2291.86s]  I love this, though.
[2291.86s -> 2293.06s]  This is fucking fantastic.
[2294.50s -> 2296.46s]  Look at here.
[2297.02s -> 2298.46s]  You've even got that Nightwing.
[2300.25s -> 2301.53s]  You've just successfully...
[2301.53s -> 2303.37s]  Besides that part, I mean...
[2303.93s -> 2306.49s]  You've just successfully made like a cool Nightwing.
[2309.27s -> 2311.11s]  This is just Nightwing but cool.
[2311.11s -> 2313.83s]  Nightwing is cool, but like this is like a cool Nightwing.
[2313.83s -> 2320.33s]  It's incredibly detailed, yeah?
[2321.21s -> 2323.34s]  This is fantastic.
[2327.03s -> 2328.50s]  We got...
[2328.50s -> 2329.54s]  I make that face a lot.
[2331.56s -> 2334.20s]  This is like how I feel when I play Animal Crossing.
[2334.20s -> 2335.72s]  This exact image.
[2335.72s -> 2339.58s]  You know what I mean?
[2339.58s -> 2340.78s]  Anybody else feel like that?
[2343.70s -> 2344.10s]  I do.
[2345.86s -> 2346.84s]  Looks great.
[2346.84s -> 2347.16s]  Thank you.
[2349.59s -> 2351.03s]  Here he's an OK streamer.
[2351.75s -> 2353.11s]  This is from, I believe...
[2354.15s -> 2355.03s]  Was it WarioWare?
[2355.99s -> 2356.79s]  There you guys.
[2358.47s -> 2359.03s]  That's me.
[2360.71s -> 2364.90s]  Yoshi's Happy Song, please.
[2364.90s -> 2365.78s]  Is that what it's called?
[2366.74s -> 2371.00s]  Rhythm Heaven.
[2371.00s -> 2371.72s]  It's not WarioWare.
[2371.72s -> 2372.76s]  Oh, well, whatever.
[2373.48s -> 2375.86s]  I thought it was...
[2375.86s -> 2376.66s]  This is not WarioWare?
[2377.94s -> 2378.79s]  Oh, no, yeah.
[2378.79s -> 2379.51s]  It's Rhythm Heaven.
[2379.51s -> 2379.83s]  You're right.
[2381.59s -> 2389.88s]  Fucking hate this picture.
[2391.08s -> 2392.04s]  Why would I...
[2392.04s -> 2393.08s]  Oh, it's so bad.
[2393.96s -> 2394.28s]  It's just...
[2395.72s -> 2399.03s]  Like my...
[2399.03s -> 2401.67s]  Look at my skin is so like blotchy and...
[2403.03s -> 2407.40s]  Feel like I'm sweating.
[2407.40s -> 2409.08s]  My hair is really greasy and stuff.
[2409.08s -> 2410.44s]  That looks just bad.
[2411.72s -> 2413.24s]  I hate this fucking picture.
[2413.24s -> 2414.04s]  You guys don't know that.
[2414.04s -> 2415.24s]  You mean you do, but you don't.
[2416.84s -> 2419.08s]  I really, really don't like this picture.
[2420.70s -> 2421.26s]  I hate it.
[2422.38s -> 2424.30s]  Look at how many images exist of my face
[2424.30s -> 2425.34s]  doing something fucking weird.
[2425.98s -> 2428.22s]  This is the only one that I truly don't like.
[2428.22s -> 2429.82s]  I truly hate this picture.
[2430.86s -> 2431.34s]  Truly.
[2431.34s -> 2432.38s]  Not even making a joke.
[2432.38s -> 2433.74s]  Like no fucking around.
[2433.74s -> 2435.66s]  I hate this photo.
[2436.22s -> 2441.64s]  Every time I see it, I'm just like...
[2442.44s -> 2445.24s]  Oh, it's so fucking gross and shitty.
[2446.52s -> 2448.90s]  I know this life.
[2449.46s -> 2452.71s]  This is me trying to beat chili.
[2453.67s -> 2454.63s]  Fast chilies.
[2461.18s -> 2463.02s]  It wasn't fucking completable.
[2464.94s -> 2465.90s]  It wasn't completable.
[2465.90s -> 2467.10s]  This is making me want to click this.
[2469.61s -> 2470.89s]  Happy Yoshi's song.
[2470.89s -> 2472.09s]  Yoshi's happy song.
[2473.61s -> 2477.67s]  Where is it?
[2477.67s -> 2479.19s]  I just typed in happy Yoshi.
[2480.55s -> 2481.83s]  Happy Yoshi's song.
[2482.55s -> 2484.50s]  Yoshi's happy song.
[2485.14s -> 2485.62s]  Is this it?
[2487.93s -> 2488.49s]  This is it.
[2488.49s -> 2488.97s]  This is it.
[2488.97s -> 2489.37s]  You ready?
[2490.01s -> 2520.58s]  So I had...
[2520.58s -> 2520.82s]  What?
[2520.82s -> 2521.38s]  Eat what?
[2530.33s -> 2531.85s]  Not even fucking close.
[2531.85s -> 2532.81s]  You jokers.
[2533.93s -> 2535.45s]  You jokesters.
[2535.45s -> 2536.97s]  Not even fucking close.
[2536.97s -> 2537.69s]  Not even close.
[2538.65s -> 2543.13s]  I was going to give you the benefit of the doubt on that one.
[2543.13s -> 2543.85s]  Not even close.
[2544.49s -> 2546.01s]  Not even remotely close.
[2546.57s -> 2546.81s]  All right.
[2546.81s -> 2549.05s]  How about what about the OST?
[2549.77s -> 2553.03s]  It's literally the same.
[2553.03s -> 2553.59s]  No, it's not.
[2553.59s -> 2554.09s]  Eat.
[2559.40s -> 2562.20s]  No, you're stretching so far.
[2563.72s -> 2565.32s]  I can hear the first part.
[2565.32s -> 2565.88s]  But the...
[2565.88s -> 2566.38s]  Eat.
[2568.76s -> 2569.80s]  No, sorry.
[2572.97s -> 2574.49s]  No, you're not even close.
[2574.49s -> 2575.77s]  I'm not going to give that one to you.
[2575.77s -> 2582.26s]  This is the six stages of fireman.
[2586.97s -> 2588.41s]  The six stages of fireman.
[2589.13s -> 2590.09s]  It's confusion.
[2592.15s -> 2593.19s]  Confusion.
[2593.19s -> 2593.99s]  Confusion.
[2593.99s -> 2594.63s]  Insanity.
[2595.43s -> 2595.83s]  Lust.
[2596.71s -> 2597.35s]  Depression.
[2600.76s -> 2601.88s]  Wistfulness.
[2601.88s -> 2603.08s]  And suave.
[2603.08s -> 2605.16s]  The six stages of fireman.
[2605.16s -> 2610.49s]  This is great though.
[2611.53s -> 2615.98s]  How do you get it to look like this?
[2616.70s -> 2617.50s]  That's what I want to know.
[2618.70s -> 2622.87s]  How do you get the eyes to look like that?
[2624.31s -> 2628.60s]  That like the shiny...
[2628.60s -> 2629.88s]  The shiny eyes would...
[2629.88s -> 2631.16s]  They look like they're coming out.
[2631.16s -> 2631.88s]  They're bulging.
[2632.44s -> 2633.08s]  It's just...
[2633.08s -> 2633.40s]  How do you...
[2633.40s -> 2634.44s]  What is that technique?
[2634.44s -> 2634.76s]  It's just...
[2634.76s -> 2636.04s]  It's a shading technique.
[2636.04s -> 2636.84s]  It looks insane.
[2637.48s -> 2638.76s]  It's called talent.
[2638.84s -> 2640.20s]  Maybe I should find some.
[2640.20s -> 2641.32s]  Is that what you were going to say next?
[2645.43s -> 2646.63s]  Even if that person is now...
[2646.63s -> 2648.23s]  That's not what they were going to say next.
[2648.23s -> 2649.59s]  I predict that that's what they were going to say.
[2649.59s -> 2650.15s]  So ban them.
[2653.74s -> 2655.10s]  You're a big rat for you.
[2656.46s -> 2657.82s]  I don't know why I put this one in.
[2659.03s -> 2659.67s]  I don't know.
[2659.67s -> 2660.39s]  It's just...
[2660.39s -> 2660.71s]  I just...
[2662.15s -> 2662.71s]  I know...
[2662.71s -> 2662.95s]  Okay.
[2662.95s -> 2666.63s]  I know like I've said that not every submission is guaranteed to get in.
[2666.63s -> 2667.51s]  And there's...
[2667.51s -> 2669.27s]  There's a lot of submissions and some fault...
[2669.83s -> 2671.11s]  I don't put them all in.
[2671.11s -> 2671.99s]  And then some people are like,
[2671.99s -> 2673.75s]  Why did you fucking put this in then?
[2673.75s -> 2674.55s]  It's like I don't...
[2674.55s -> 2675.51s]  I don't know.
[2675.51s -> 2676.39s]  I don't know.
[2676.39s -> 2677.27s]  I don't know.
[2677.27s -> 2677.83s]  I just did.
[2678.55s -> 2679.19s]  I just was like,
[2679.19s -> 2680.15s]  Oh, I just won.
[2680.15s -> 2680.87s]  I don't know.
[2680.87s -> 2681.91s]  Some of them just get...
[2681.91s -> 2682.23s]  I don't know.
[2682.23s -> 2682.87s]  Some of them going.
[2683.99s -> 2684.79s]  I try.
[2685.35s -> 2687.70s]  Oh, look.
[2687.70s -> 2688.82s]  He ate so much honey.
[2689.54s -> 2691.10s]  What is that?
[2691.10s -> 2691.58s]  Mustard?
[2692.14s -> 2693.13s]  What is that?
[2697.27s -> 2698.07s]  It's cheese.
[2699.19s -> 2700.79s]  Because he's a fucking rat.
[2705.94s -> 2708.26s]  Thank you, Mr. Spicy Dude.
[2708.90s -> 2711.38s]  I don't know.
[2711.38s -> 2713.46s]  The only time you ever see like yellow like that
[2713.46s -> 2715.86s]  is Winnie the Pooh when he like stuffs his hand inside
[2715.86s -> 2717.06s]  and puts it all over his face.
[2717.78s -> 2720.87s]  No, I don't want to control W.
[2722.23s -> 2727.45s]  He drank Girardi.
[2745.30s -> 2748.10s]  This one's not much more sane.
[2748.82s -> 2749.22s]  I'm just...
[2750.74s -> 2753.45s]  I don't know.
[2753.45s -> 2754.33s]  It's fucked up.
[2755.61s -> 2758.87s]  And I don't know why I have the rat in a bottle like that.
[2761.34s -> 2761.74s]  I...
[2761.74s -> 2762.22s]  It's relevant.
[2762.22s -> 2764.22s]  It was relevant because it was like the crack streams
[2764.22s -> 2765.58s]  from the last day or two.
[2766.46s -> 2768.01s]  Why is he in the...
[2768.01s -> 2769.05s]  Why is he screwed in here?
[2769.61s -> 2772.98s]  I'm a quick...
[2772.98s -> 2773.22s]  What?
[2773.22s -> 2773.70s]  What?
[2773.70s -> 2773.94s]  What?
[2773.94s -> 2774.18s]  What?
[2774.18s -> 2774.50s]  What?
[2774.50s -> 2774.74s]  What?
[2774.74s -> 2775.06s]  What?
[2775.06s -> 2775.62s]  What?
[2775.94s -> 2776.18s]  What?
[2776.18s -> 2776.82s]  What happened?
[2776.82s -> 2777.38s]  What was it?
[2778.02s -> 2778.74s]  What?
[2778.74s -> 2779.30s]  What was it?
[2779.30s -> 2779.94s]  What happened?
[2779.94s -> 2780.50s]  What was it?
[2781.14s -> 2783.45s]  Is there a dick or something?
[2783.45s -> 2791.37s]  Is there a dick on camera?
[2791.37s -> 2791.77s]  Skip it.
[2791.77s -> 2792.25s]  Skip it.
[2792.25s -> 2792.65s]  I don't...
[2792.65s -> 2793.37s]  It's just me.
[2793.37s -> 2794.33s]  I don't...
[2794.33s -> 2794.65s]  What?
[2796.22s -> 2796.78s]  Bottom right.
[2796.78s -> 2797.34s]  Bottom right.
[2797.90s -> 2799.69s]  There's no dick on the bottom right.
[2799.69s -> 2800.41s]  I'm just like...
[2800.41s -> 2801.13s]  I have a rat.
[2801.85s -> 2802.33s]  I don't know like...
[2803.83s -> 2805.43s]  The Fraggles used to do this shit.
[2805.43s -> 2807.99s]  And Fraggle Rock, the guy that used to catch the Fraggles.
[2807.99s -> 2808.63s]  What is this?
[2814.44s -> 2815.08s]  Bottom right.
[2821.10s -> 2821.50s]  Funny.
[2823.18s -> 2823.66s]  I don't get it.
[2823.66s -> 2823.90s]  What?
[2823.90s -> 2825.02s]  I mean what happened?
[2825.58s -> 2826.62s]  Look at how cool this is.
[2827.26s -> 2831.34s]  Not bottom right on you.
[2831.34s -> 2832.78s]  Bottom right on my screen.
[2833.58s -> 2836.01s]  This is...
[2836.01s -> 2838.09s]  Oh, here are the eight stages of Jerma.
[2839.30s -> 2839.86s]  Sadness.
[2840.74s -> 2841.38s]  Confusion.
[2842.26s -> 2843.30s]  Pretending to know.
[2843.94s -> 2845.38s]  Adequate.
[2847.03s -> 2847.43s]  Sad.
[2848.31s -> 2848.71s]  Anger.
[2849.59s -> 2850.31s]  Acceptance.
[2851.18s -> 2852.06s]  3D.
[2852.06s -> 2856.66s]  There are the eight stages of Jerma 985.
[2857.22s -> 2865.82s]  This is awesome.
[2865.82s -> 2870.87s]  I guess this is what it would be like if I was a real cartoon character.
[2871.67s -> 2873.67s]  Although real and cartoon characters don't.
[2874.31s -> 2875.43s]  That's an oxymoron.
[2875.67s -> 2876.55s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[2877.19s -> 2879.98s]  What are you...
[2879.98s -> 2881.34s]  What stage are you in right now?
[2881.90s -> 2882.38s]  Find out.
[2883.02s -> 2890.71s]  Fucking anger.
[2891.43s -> 2892.47s]  Always anger.
[2893.11s -> 2893.59s]  Always.
[2894.95s -> 2898.97s]  Hey, this is me from Rhythm Heaven.
[2899.53s -> 2902.66s]  There are no more stages.
[2902.66s -> 2903.46s]  Anger only.
[2904.18s -> 2908.90s]  And this is beautiful.
[2908.90s -> 2913.10s]  With a little golf...
[2913.10s -> 2914.86s]  With a little golf guy.
[2915.50s -> 2918.94s]  Oh, she's burped on you again.
[2919.50s -> 2922.18s]  Put on the Outer Wilds OST.
[2922.18s -> 2922.68s]  Ooh.
[2924.02s -> 2926.47s]  That's a good one.
[2927.11s -> 2927.99s]  That's a really good one.
[2928.55s -> 2930.68s]  Oh, this is exactly what I was looking for.
[2931.24s -> 2936.46s]  And I won't be listening to it.
[2936.46s -> 2937.86s]  I hope it's good.
[2938.42s -> 2938.98s]  Because I can't...
[2938.98s -> 2939.78s]  I have to talk to you.
[2940.58s -> 2942.02s]  Music fucks with my brain.
[2942.02s -> 2943.06s]  I can't have a good message.
[2943.06s -> 2944.82s]  But it goes into my electrodes.
[2944.82s -> 2945.62s]  On my head.
[2945.62s -> 2946.34s]  Inside my brain.
[2946.34s -> 2947.70s]  I can't talk.
[2947.70s -> 2948.74s]  That's why I don't listen to music.
[2949.38s -> 2951.82s]  This is great, though.
[2952.38s -> 2954.97s]  Hey, we have a fucking animated rat.
[2956.81s -> 2958.09s]  Animated rat.
[2958.09s -> 2958.97s]  Back and forth.
[2958.97s -> 2960.41s]  He's doing this way, that way.
[2960.41s -> 2961.13s]  This way, that way.
[2961.85s -> 2965.99s]  Please get some this way, that ways in the chat, please.
[2965.99s -> 2967.83s]  Hey, any this way, that way in the chat?
[2967.99s -> 2969.19s]  Or sorry, I'm saying it wrong.
[2969.19s -> 2969.99s]  This way, that way.
[2970.71s -> 2974.55s]  German auto, of course.
[2977.03s -> 2978.31s]  Good heavens, would you look at the time.
[2978.31s -> 2978.87s]  This is about...
[2978.87s -> 2979.91s]  This is the Lord of the Rings...
[2980.55s -> 2980.79s]  The...
[2981.43s -> 2981.99s]  Video game.
[2983.11s -> 2983.91s]  The ladder mission.
[2984.79s -> 2985.83s]  I just thought it was funny.
[2988.62s -> 2989.58s]  The more orc sounds.
[2993.59s -> 2995.03s]  Oh, no, that's what's on the screen.
[2996.41s -> 2996.91s]  Right.
[3003.54s -> 3004.26s]  It's...
[3004.26s -> 3004.74s]  I don't know.
[3004.74s -> 3005.38s]  It just was...
[3005.38s -> 3006.34s]  It made me laugh.
[3006.34s -> 3006.84s]  And...
[3007.56s -> 3010.20s]  Here's your criteria for how to get on community content night.
[3011.38s -> 3012.58s]  Did I open this and go...
[3014.60s -> 3015.40s]  That's it.
[3015.40s -> 3016.36s]  Or did I open this and go...
[3018.30s -> 3019.34s]  Or did I open this and go...
[3021.29s -> 3021.79s]  Or...
[3022.66s -> 3023.38s]  Huh?
[3023.38s -> 3025.62s]  As long as I hit one of the eight stages of fucking...
[3025.62s -> 3026.42s]  Germagreif.
[3026.42s -> 3026.90s]  Whatever it is.
[3026.90s -> 3027.94s]  Eight stages of Gurb...
[3027.94s -> 3028.74s]  Gurb...
[3028.74s -> 3029.86s]  Gurbababy.
[3029.86s -> 3032.34s]  As long as I turn into a Gurbababy on stream, that's how you know.
[3034.57s -> 3036.97s]  The eight stages of Gurbababy.
[3038.14s -> 3038.78s]  That is...
[3038.78s -> 3040.14s]  I just explained to you what they were.
[3040.14s -> 3040.46s]  I just...
[3040.46s -> 3041.26s]  That's all baby.
[3042.22s -> 3044.78s]  Sad, confusion, anger, 3D.
[3045.50s -> 3045.90s]  There are...
[3045.90s -> 3048.46s]  There are no other baby emotions.
[3056.57s -> 3058.01s]  Jex is back for another round.
[3058.57s -> 3060.17s]  And Jex reloaded.
[3062.78s -> 3065.26s]  Jeremy Elbertson and Willem Dafoe.
[3065.82s -> 3069.45s]  Is Willem Dafoe Jex in this scenario?
[3070.25s -> 3075.00s]  And Willem Dafoe is Jex.
[3075.56s -> 3079.18s]  Why are we listening to what?
[3086.84s -> 3087.16s]  There.
[3087.16s -> 3087.40s]  Okay.
[3087.40s -> 3087.96s]  I changed it.
[3089.77s -> 3091.53s]  Compact streamed pictures presents.
[3092.25s -> 3093.69s]  Loud P and Cloud...
[3093.69s -> 3094.65s]  Cloud car films.
[3095.37s -> 3096.65s]  Willem Dafoe film.
[3096.65s -> 3097.85s]  Jeremy Elbertson.
[3097.85s -> 3098.41s]  Steven...
[3098.41s -> 3099.13s]  Sorry.
[3099.13s -> 3099.53s]  Why?
[3099.53s -> 3100.25s]  Why is...
[3100.33s -> 3101.85s]  Willem Dafoe Jex reloaded.
[3101.85s -> 3103.53s]  Music by John Williams.
[3103.53s -> 3107.00s]  There are more.
[3107.00s -> 3110.92s]  The adventure comes to an end.
[3111.56s -> 3113.67s]  This is Jex, 1985.
[3113.67s -> 3115.91s]  Willem Dafoe is in this one too, apparently.
[3115.91s -> 3124.09s]  Jeremy Elbertson, Willem Dafoe, Alicia Winder, Gabe Degrossi.
[3125.59s -> 3127.99s]  Well, I love how Xeraxos is just in here too.
[3129.27s -> 3131.30s]  Why is this the end of the stream, boys?
[3132.02s -> 3134.44s]  Jex, 1980.
[3134.44s -> 3135.08s]  I think there's another one.
[3135.72s -> 3136.44s]  Yeah.
[3136.44s -> 3138.44s]  From the director that brought you Socrates.
[3138.44s -> 3139.80s]  A Jerva Craft story.
[3140.76s -> 3143.40s]  Willem Dafoe and Jeremy Elbertson is Jex.
[3143.40s -> 3145.40s]  A Jermacraft story.
[3146.68s -> 3160.22s]  Okay, like that...
[3161.10s -> 3162.14s]  This is like the...
[3162.14s -> 3162.86s]  If I made the...
[3162.86s -> 3165.74s]  You know, like when the YouTuber makes the movie?
[3166.22s -> 3169.27s]  Like, Jex, a Jermacraft story.
[3169.27s -> 3170.55s]  That would probably be what it was.
[3170.55s -> 3176.65s]  I mean, no one would ever give me the money to do that, though.
[3176.65s -> 3181.02s]  No, I don't think so.
[3181.98s -> 3183.64s]  I'm not sure...
[3183.64s -> 3184.28s]  Here's the thing, guys.
[3184.28s -> 3189.24s]  Anytime an investor wants to invest in film production or into a movie,
[3189.48s -> 3191.16s]  they're anticipating some kind of return.
[3192.52s -> 3195.16s]  I could guarantee that whatever movie that...
[3195.16s -> 3199.48s]  If you were an investor in my movie, you would go negative.
[3200.04s -> 3201.40s]  It would not be a single return.
[3202.70s -> 3204.86s]  You would just be able to watch the movie and go,
[3204.86s -> 3207.26s]  oh, that was kind of...
[3207.26s -> 3207.82s]  That was...
[3207.82s -> 3208.22s]  All right.
[3209.64s -> 3210.44s]  Maybe like...
[3211.16s -> 3216.04s]  I could probably reliably guarantee 1,000 to 2,000 downloads on iTunes.
[3216.92s -> 3217.56s]  Like, you know...
[3217.56s -> 3219.88s]  And then I could say, you know, maybe like 10,000 clicks.
[3220.36s -> 3222.92s]  And maybe like 1,000 to 2,000 iTunes downloads.
[3223.96s -> 3226.17s]  And that's it.
[3226.17s -> 3228.90s]  It would be a flop.
[3228.90s -> 3229.46s]  It would be.
[3233.64s -> 3234.04s]  If you don't...
[3234.60s -> 3237.24s]  Do you don't think this movie would be a flop?
[3237.80s -> 3239.08s]  How much money did this cost?
[3240.30s -> 3241.98s]  There are 6,500 people right now.
[3241.98s -> 3246.06s]  If every single person here watched this movie 50 times,
[3246.06s -> 3250.54s]  that wouldn't even scratch the surface of the last Adam Sandler movie that released on Netflix.
[3251.18s -> 3258.87s]  It would be like one hour of revenue from the latest Adam Sandler movie.
[3258.87s -> 3261.38s]  I don't think it would turn out all right.
[3261.38s -> 3261.62s]  I like it.
[3261.62s -> 3262.42s]  This one made me laugh.
[3263.30s -> 3263.86s]  Hey, Fred.
[3265.06s -> 3267.30s]  Did you know there are a bunch of cavemen in the car?
[3268.84s -> 3271.56s]  Bonnie, shut the fuck up!
[3271.56s -> 3273.51s]  Something like that, right?
[3279.21s -> 3280.41s]  This is not corny.
[3280.41s -> 3281.05s]  It better not be.
[3281.77s -> 3285.30s]  Why would he?
[3285.30s -> 3286.26s]  Why was he Bernie?
[3286.26s -> 3287.06s]  What do you mean, Bernie?
[3287.78s -> 3288.63s]  Hey, Fred.
[3289.19s -> 3291.59s]  Did you know there's a bunch of cavemen in the car?
[3291.83s -> 3294.31s]  That's not everybody's Bernie Sanders, guys.
[3295.27s -> 3296.70s]  Hey, Fred.
[3296.70s -> 3297.34s]  Hey, Fred.
[3297.34s -> 3298.14s]  Hey, Fred.
[3298.14s -> 3298.70s]  Hey, Fred.
[3298.70s -> 3300.62s]  Did you know that the banks...
[3300.62s -> 3301.34s]  Okay, it could be.
[3301.90s -> 3303.10s]  This needs a little bit more.
[3303.10s -> 3305.02s]  It needs a little bit more Bernie pog on it.
[3305.02s -> 3305.82s]  I can see it.
[3308.60s -> 3309.56s]  This is just cute.
[3309.56s -> 3315.86s]  I would probably hurt.
[3315.86s -> 3319.78s]  You're literally on fire.
[3319.78s -> 3320.50s]  I mean, kind of.
[3321.06s -> 3322.31s]  Not literally.
[3322.95s -> 3326.66s]  I got the hair pretty good, too.
[3328.57s -> 3334.33s]  And you've got my big cheekbones and my fucking eye sink.
[3342.84s -> 3343.64s]  Ego maniac.
[3345.30s -> 3348.50s]  I didn't say anything and that makes me fucking irresistible.
[3348.50s -> 3349.38s]  No, I just said that.
[3349.38s -> 3351.38s]  You got my face good.
[3353.74s -> 3366.41s]  But I didn't even have to.
[3366.41s -> 3383.02s]  I'm not the Joker.
[3383.02s -> 3384.54s]  I'm the Riddler.
[3384.54s -> 3387.11s]  And I know, we've gone over this before.
[3387.11s -> 3390.07s]  Everyone that says they're the Riddler is the Joker.
[3390.07s -> 3393.03s]  And everyone that says they're the Joker is Robin.
[3393.03s -> 3393.51s]  I know.
[3394.07s -> 3394.87s]  I get it.
[3394.87s -> 3396.31s]  Trust me, we've talked about it.
[3396.31s -> 3414.68s]  But I wasn't crying on that one.
[3421.10s -> 3422.14s]  I wasn't crying.
[3424.30s -> 3425.50s]  I was not crying.
[3425.50s -> 3430.70s]  I was just, I was just stage, I was stage five.
[3430.70s -> 3431.50s]  Confused.
[3432.06s -> 3448.07s]  Change the world.
[3449.83s -> 3450.23s]  I don't know.
[3450.23s -> 3450.71s]  What is this?
[3451.43s -> 3451.91s]  Goodbye.
[3452.47s -> 3457.64s]  My message.
[3458.20s -> 3459.40s]  Change, change, change.
[3459.40s -> 3459.72s]  What?
[3459.72s -> 3460.12s]  What?
[3460.12s -> 3460.36s]  What?
[3460.92s -> 3461.40s]  Do I need to?
[3461.40s -> 3461.64s]  Okay.
[3462.68s -> 3463.72s]  Do I need some screening?
[3464.36s -> 3466.79s]  Do I need screening on these?
[3466.79s -> 3468.79s]  Have I gotten to the point where I need these to be screened?
[3472.44s -> 3472.84s]  Yes.
[3472.84s -> 3473.64s]  Fuck.
[3473.64s -> 3480.20s]  This is from the take a picture of your face with your iPhone
[3480.20s -> 3481.16s]  and everyone looks like that.
[3481.96s -> 3482.76s]  What's this though?
[3483.96s -> 3485.32s]  What's the whole dug here?
[3486.12s -> 3495.62s]  Is that a Game Boy?
[3496.58s -> 3498.50s]  Oh, that's Hidden Folk.
[3498.50s -> 3499.38s]  Oh, right, right, right.
[3504.76s -> 3507.32s]  This one's just, this one's the kiss.
[3508.04s -> 3513.02s]  The kiss.
[3513.02s -> 3514.70s]  Is there any music playing?
[3514.70s -> 3518.06s]  Why does it look like there's no music?
[3521.32s -> 3522.04s]  That's very clever.
[3527.77s -> 3530.97s]  Well, let's get some, let's get something upbeat.
[3531.61s -> 3534.01s]  Something upbeat but still relatively smooth and calm.
[3535.05s -> 3540.31s]  What's another one that's like a smooth and calm but upbeat at the same time?
[3541.43s -> 3542.84s]  Mario Galaxy.
[3542.84s -> 3543.96s]  Yeah, oh yeah, let's go.
[3543.96s -> 3545.24s]  Mario Galaxy OST.
[3551.82s -> 3556.38s]  Oh yeah, perfect.
[3560.92s -> 3562.84s]  This is empty and it's annoying me.
[3562.84s -> 3563.88s]  This is annoying to me.
[3565.43s -> 3568.71s]  No, what I saw, you know what I would love to install in this room?
[3569.35s -> 3574.63s]  It's like a fucking spigot that is connected to like high C fruit juice shit.
[3575.43s -> 3577.27s]  Like it's connected to the ceiling and there's a pipe
[3577.27s -> 3580.15s]  that goes all the way like around into the fridge
[3580.15s -> 3585.91s]  and it's just the high C like red juice is just filled in a big bucket
[3585.91s -> 3588.39s]  and there's a little spigot that comes down right here.
[3588.39s -> 3589.83s]  Like literally right there.
[3589.83s -> 3594.46s]  And I can just go over here and just go and fill it up with high C fruit punch.
[3595.46s -> 3601.26s]  Oh, that's a hamster.
[3602.62s -> 3606.78s]  Okay, and have you noticed how just, how well that works?
[3608.09s -> 3610.49s]  If I had, don't even give me this bullshit.
[3610.49s -> 3614.89s]  If you guys had a hamster feeder in your room, you don't, you wouldn't use it.
[3614.89s -> 3616.33s]  It wouldn't be something that you did every day.
[3617.54s -> 3622.42s]  If you were able to, there was a big thing right there that just always,
[3622.42s -> 3626.42s]  always gave you never ending liquid and food.
[3627.14s -> 3628.50s]  I would be okay with this.
[3629.58s -> 3633.66s]  If it turned out that I was just, I was just in like, I was a hamster
[3633.66s -> 3637.10s]  and there was somebody just feeding me fucking just huge water.
[3637.10s -> 3638.78s]  I would be like, oh shit, this is free.
[3638.78s -> 3639.50s]  This is awesome.
[3641.32s -> 3643.48s]  The Reddit, you're a Reddit hamster man child.
[3646.42s -> 3646.66s]  Okay.
[3646.66s -> 3651.46s]  If there was a never ending supply of water and food right there, huge.
[3652.41s -> 3658.46s]  And all I had to do was go like, wow, it's fucking never ending.
[3659.18s -> 3663.74s]  And so, and every like, every like few days, a huge hand comes in
[3663.74s -> 3666.22s]  and just like unscrews the fucking thing.
[3666.22s -> 3670.06s]  And then I see another huge hand, put it back and it's just, I didn't have to do shit.
[3670.86s -> 3673.10s]  I didn't have to do anything.
[3673.10s -> 3674.86s]  You just, you gave that to me.
[3675.50s -> 3677.90s]  Oh, let's get another free refill, man.
[3680.97s -> 3681.61s]  You're lazy.
[3682.33s -> 3684.58s]  This is weird, weird, weird.
[3684.58s -> 3685.54s]  What do you mean weird?
[3685.54s -> 3686.42s]  How is this weird?
[3686.42s -> 3687.86s]  This is a, what?
[3687.86s -> 3694.70s]  This is due to, why are you doing this?
[3694.70s -> 3698.79s]  This is a, this is a, this is a creepy fetish.
[3699.35s -> 3699.59s]  What?
[3700.58s -> 3706.02s]  No, I just wanted, I just thought it would be cool to have a bunch of stuff for free.
[3706.58s -> 3708.34s]  Like a never ending water.
[3709.14s -> 3712.22s]  I just want to be like the hamster.
[3712.22s -> 3713.10s]  Is that, what?
[3715.94s -> 3718.58s]  I just wanted to have a big giant.
[3718.58s -> 3718.98s]  All right.
[3719.80s -> 3723.32s]  You know how you can get like the water jugs with the water cooler thing?
[3723.32s -> 3723.96s]  A water cooler.
[3723.96s -> 3725.08s]  You can get one of those.
[3725.08s -> 3728.36s]  Imagine if the water cooler was a hundred times the size
[3728.36s -> 3729.96s]  and it was connected to your garage.
[3730.52s -> 3732.41s]  What's so wrong with that?
[3734.18s -> 3735.22s]  What's wrong with that?
[3735.22s -> 3741.08s]  Would you rather have a place to put your car in your garage
[3741.08s -> 3744.44s]  or a big water jug that was like 6,000 gallons?
[3744.44s -> 3748.36s]  I don't understand what the problem is.
[3748.36s -> 3749.00s]  This is cool though.
[3749.00s -> 3750.04s]  Nice image.
[3750.04s -> 3754.84s]  This is great.
[3754.84s -> 3756.28s]  I love this one too.
[3756.28s -> 3758.12s]  Auto in the baby carrier.
[3758.12s -> 3761.00s]  I mean, tap water.
[3761.00s -> 3769.10s]  No, no, like purified, clean, super quadruple osmosis
[3769.10s -> 3772.41s]  and then cleaned and then put through another filter.
[3772.41s -> 3775.14s]  Triple water, not tap water.
[3775.14s -> 3776.57s]  No.
[3776.57s -> 3778.33s]  You guys always make fun of boomers.
[3778.33s -> 3780.15s]  Boomers drink tap water.
[3780.15s -> 3781.19s]  That's like a boomer thing.
[3782.23s -> 3784.63s]  I'll take that tap water from the sinks.
[3784.63s -> 3786.68s]  That's a boomer thing.
[3786.68s -> 3794.47s]  You guys have more in common than you think?
[3794.47s -> 3795.78s]  Yes, it is.
[3795.78s -> 3797.43s]  You know how I know that?
[3797.43s -> 3801.51s]  Because my grandmother used to have friends over to play bridge.
[3802.79s -> 3805.03s]  And that's where this voice comes from, by the way.
[3805.03s -> 3808.31s]  This is just me doing an imitation of my grandmother.
[3808.31s -> 3810.87s]  This is exactly how my grandmother used to talk.
[3811.67s -> 3814.09s]  This is her exact voice.
[3814.09s -> 3817.98s]  So they would come over and all of them would drink tap water.
[3817.98s -> 3820.26s]  They'd be like, oh, do you want something to drink?
[3820.26s -> 3821.94s]  Yeah, I'll drink tap water.
[3821.94s -> 3823.70s]  It's fine.
[3823.70s -> 3824.42s]  They would all line up.
[3828.22s -> 3829.56s]  We had sodas.
[3829.56s -> 3830.92s]  We had bottles.
[3831.00s -> 3831.96s]  We had all kinds of...
[3831.96s -> 3832.76s]  We had like juice.
[3832.76s -> 3834.20s]  We had orange juice.
[3834.20s -> 3835.80s]  We had fucking...
[3835.80s -> 3837.24s]  They were like beers.
[3837.24s -> 3839.48s]  No, just tap water is fine.
[3839.48s -> 3845.37s]  It's cute.
[3845.37s -> 3848.06s]  They are zoomers, Jerma.
[3848.06s -> 3849.42s]  Water equals boomer.
[3849.42s -> 3849.92s]  No.
[3850.54s -> 3853.90s]  I'm telling you, drinking tap water out of like the kitchen sink.
[3853.90s -> 3854.38s]  That's a...
[3854.38s -> 3855.66s]  Boomers love that.
[3855.66s -> 3858.79s]  You're a furry.
[3858.79s -> 3859.91s]  How does this make me a furry?
[3868.82s -> 3870.90s]  Drinking tap water makes me a furry.
[3870.90s -> 3877.11s]  This is fantastic, though.
[3877.11s -> 3877.75s]  I love this.
[3877.75s -> 3879.27s]  And I love coffee, too.
[3879.27s -> 3882.20s]  I should just get one of these mugs.
[3882.20s -> 3888.10s]  You were purring.
[3888.10s -> 3896.46s]  Motherfuckers.
[3897.58s -> 3899.42s]  You motherfuckers.
[3900.46s -> 3902.62s]  Because I was doing the water sound.
[3902.62s -> 3903.12s]  Whatever.
[3903.74s -> 3911.98s]  I was going to use that and put it somewhere that I...
[3911.98s -> 3913.26s]  This is how I feel every day.
[3914.06s -> 3920.33s]  Everybody else get up in the morning, look in the mirror, and this is what you see.
[3922.23s -> 3923.91s]  That's just how I feel when I get...
[3923.91s -> 3926.39s]  When I'm looking in the mirror in the morning, this is just what I feel.
[3928.42s -> 3931.82s]  It's like, but look at...
[3932.46s -> 3933.02s]  You've got the...
[3933.02s -> 3933.52s]  The...
[3941.54s -> 3942.10s]  Butthead.
[3942.82s -> 3944.26s]  From Beavis and Butthead.
[3949.21s -> 3954.41s]  Yes, I'm coming to the realization now that I am the combination of both Beavis and Butthead.
[3956.89s -> 3957.61s]  I know.
[3957.61s -> 3964.38s]  Laugh at everything.
[3968.86s -> 3971.03s]  I think the dumbest shit is cool.
[3972.22s -> 3973.10s]  I look like that.
[3974.06s -> 3974.94s]  I know.
[3974.94s -> 3976.62s]  I'm both Beavis and Butthead.
[3976.62s -> 3979.02s]  But I have linguistic skills.
[3984.57s -> 3986.65s]  I have high linguistic skills.
[3986.65s -> 3988.81s]  My talking and my pronunciation.
[3989.37s -> 3996.68s]  I'm only like 40% Beavis and Butthead.
[3996.68s -> 3998.20s]  I don't know half the things I'm saying.
[3998.84s -> 4001.51s]  But phonetically, I can say whatever you want.
[4004.60s -> 4008.01s]  Uh...
[4008.01s -> 4008.49s]  Excellent.
[4008.49s -> 4009.61s]  Excellent articulation.
[4009.61s -> 4010.11s]  Yeah.
[4011.91s -> 4012.55s]  Excellent.
[4012.55s -> 4013.83s]  Excellent articulation.
[4020.38s -> 4020.94s]  I love this.
[4022.09s -> 4023.05s]  Skip this one.
[4023.05s -> 4024.41s]  No, that's not...
[4024.41s -> 4025.21s]  That's a pencil.
[4026.89s -> 4028.01s]  He's got...
[4028.01s -> 4029.37s]  It's an eraser.
[4030.01s -> 4033.11s]  It's an eraser.
[4033.85s -> 4034.65s]  It's an eraser.
[4035.21s -> 4036.01s]  It's an eraser.
[4037.74s -> 4038.94s]  It's just an eraser.
[4039.58s -> 4042.94s]  This is great, though.
[4042.94s -> 4043.44s]  Thank you.
[4046.38s -> 4047.18s]  Shido's back there.
[4047.18s -> 4048.22s]  You've seen Shido.
[4048.22s -> 4048.94s]  Everyone always...
[4048.94s -> 4050.46s]  No, it's not underwear.
[4050.46s -> 4051.18s]  It's an eraser.
[4055.16s -> 4057.40s]  Why is Super Mario Galaxy playing?
[4057.40s -> 4057.96s]  It's...
[4057.96s -> 4058.44s]  I don't know.
[4058.44s -> 4059.48s]  Because people wanted to...
[4060.12s -> 4064.02s]  Well, this doesn't really match up at all.
[4064.58s -> 4070.86s]  That's better.
[4070.86s -> 4076.62s]  There's the winks.
[4078.41s -> 4078.89s]  Should I do it?
[4078.89s -> 4080.25s]  Should I redeem one?
[4080.25s -> 4085.18s]  Look at this.
[4085.18s -> 4089.58s]  And these have become so bad.
[4091.10s -> 4092.12s]  It's like...
[4093.48s -> 4095.16s]  There's too much here.
[4096.12s -> 4097.48s]  And too much here.
[4098.28s -> 4099.32s]  It's the same shirt.
[4102.66s -> 4103.86s]  It's like a blue shirt.
[4103.86s -> 4104.26s]  Whatever.
[4104.26s -> 4106.02s]  Yeah, I can't have more than one or two blue shirts.
[4110.06s -> 4113.64s]  And then you got like this shit here.
[4114.92s -> 4117.72s]  Okay, you want to see how to make yourself look really old real quickly?
[4118.28s -> 4118.84s]  I'll show you.
[4119.48s -> 4119.80s]  Okay.
[4120.92s -> 4124.87s]  Guess.
[4124.87s -> 4125.43s]  Guess my age.
[4126.23s -> 4129.83s]  32?
[4129.83s -> 4130.39s]  30?
[4130.39s -> 4131.35s]  28?
[4131.35s -> 4131.67s]  Okay.
[4132.31s -> 4134.57s]  Now guess my age.
[4154.23s -> 4155.03s]  40.
[4155.11s -> 4159.58s]  Ready?
[4159.58s -> 4167.58s]  28.
[4167.58s -> 4168.22s]  40.
[4168.22s -> 4173.98s]  28.
[4178.18s -> 4179.86s]  These hairs on these sideburn hairs?
[4180.58s -> 4183.26s]  When they stick out, you just look fucking 100 years old.
[4187.13s -> 4187.77s]  You're losing it.
[4187.77s -> 4188.17s]  No, I'm not.
[4188.17s -> 4188.65s]  That's real.
[4189.21s -> 4191.19s]  It was literally the same.
[4191.19s -> 4191.83s]  No, it wasn't.
[4191.83s -> 4193.67s]  It was these like sideburn hairs.
[4193.67s -> 4193.99s]  Look at...
[4193.99s -> 4194.55s]  This is like...
[4194.55s -> 4195.19s]  This is...
[4195.19s -> 4195.75s]  Look at that.
[4196.31s -> 4198.79s]  That increases my age by 10 years by doing this.
[4201.50s -> 4202.22s]  Look.
[4202.22s -> 4208.44s]  I just reduced my age by 10 years.
[4210.62s -> 4211.82s]  You're so self-conscious.
[4212.38s -> 4215.75s]  No, I'm self-awareness.
[4219.27s -> 4219.91s]  Tell me.
[4219.91s -> 4223.19s]  Just close these down and you'll look like fucking 20 again.
[4223.91s -> 4229.45s]  You are too self-conscious.
[4229.45s -> 4230.17s]  No, I'm not.
[4230.17s -> 4230.33s]  I...
[4232.92s -> 4235.88s]  I just showed my sideburn hair to 6,500 people.
[4235.88s -> 4236.92s]  That's not self-conscious.
[4236.92s -> 4237.40s]  That's...
[4237.40s -> 4237.88s]  Look at me.
[4238.52s -> 4240.86s]  I believe that's Joel.
[4242.46s -> 4242.94s]  I'm not...
[4242.94s -> 4243.98s]  Self-conscious be like,
[4243.98s -> 4245.10s]  Holy shit, I don't like this.
[4245.10s -> 4246.70s]  Therefore, you'll never see me again.
[4246.70s -> 4247.34s]  No, we're on.
[4248.38s -> 4256.94s]  I remember this.
[4256.94s -> 4257.66s]  This was...
[4257.66s -> 4258.30s]  This was bad.
[4260.71s -> 4262.47s]  God of War, you motherfucker.
[4265.85s -> 4266.33s]  Yeah.
[4266.41s -> 4271.77s]  Remember, you have a weird anxiety about social perception.
[4271.77s -> 4273.74s]  I don't think so.
[4276.62s -> 4277.02s]  Hold on.
[4278.46s -> 4280.33s]  Let me just...
[4281.29s -> 4282.97s]  Let's test that hypothesis.
[4282.97s -> 4304.23s]  What was...
[4304.23s -> 4306.07s]  Anything interesting written in the chat?
[4311.26s -> 4311.82s]  I think I saw...
[4313.18s -> 4313.98s]  No, no, nothing.
[4314.54s -> 4315.74s]  I don't think so.
[4318.12s -> 4319.88s]  I didn't see anything about potential...
[4320.60s -> 4322.60s]  Of huge zits that I could have on my forehead.
[4323.72s -> 4325.08s]  No, but why would I really write that?
[4325.96s -> 4327.72s]  What an odd social perception that I have.
[4328.84s -> 4332.14s]  I don't want to...
[4332.14s -> 4332.94s]  I don't want to hear music.
[4336.02s -> 4336.90s]  He's ugly.
[4340.06s -> 4342.22s]  It's a collection of zits.
[4342.22s -> 4343.02s]  No, it's two.
[4343.90s -> 4347.18s]  I don't care.
[4347.18s -> 4347.98s]  Ugly.
[4347.98s -> 4349.74s]  I think I'm beautiful.
[4350.46s -> 4351.74s]  That's all that matters.
[4361.22s -> 4363.14s]  Here's some go-go squeezy.
[4364.04s -> 4365.16s]  Because you're epic.
[4368.78s -> 4370.94s]  Is this me just doing a JoJo dance?
[4381.53s -> 4384.09s]  But yes, these are good.
[4385.21s -> 4386.73s]  Why do people have such a problem with that?
[4386.73s -> 4387.61s]  These are fantastic.
[4388.25s -> 4395.70s]  I actually haven't eaten one of these in a long time.
[4395.70s -> 4397.06s]  I do highly recommend them.
[4398.01s -> 4398.73s]  It's baby food.
[4398.73s -> 4399.45s]  It's a streamer food.
[4399.45s -> 4401.45s]  And people like to call me crazy for it, but that's fine.
[4402.09s -> 4403.69s]  This was prefaced by saying,
[4403.69s -> 4405.77s]  Jerma, please play The Sims 1.
[4406.81s -> 4416.60s]  Maybe one day.
[4420.76s -> 4422.84s]  I'll be taking that one.
[4422.84s -> 4424.52s]  Look at this shit.
[4428.41s -> 4429.37s]  Oh, I love this.
[4438.23s -> 4439.11s]  It's so good.
[4439.11s -> 4440.23s]  It's so detailed.
[4440.23s -> 4441.43s]  This is a great poster.
[4442.23s -> 4445.37s]  Take a look.
[4445.37s -> 4446.89s]  Make sure you show who did it.
[4446.89s -> 4448.63s]  He's an actual demon.
[4451.62s -> 4453.38s]  I want to get like a bunch of big coins.
[4454.58s -> 4458.26s]  Where can I get like a big heavy like minted good
[4458.26s -> 4459.94s]  just real like coin?
[4462.44s -> 4463.56s]  Like a silver coin.
[4464.12s -> 4466.14s]  I feel like just holding them and moving around.
[4466.14s -> 4467.18s]  Just forge one yourself.
[4467.82s -> 4468.46s]  Go to the bank.
[4470.58s -> 4472.02s]  So if I walk into the bank and I say,
[4472.02s -> 4474.42s]  what's the biggest coin you guys have here?
[4474.98s -> 4475.94s]  What are they going to say?
[4481.32s -> 4482.12s]  Was it a half dollar?
[4484.33s -> 4486.95s]  Go to Etsy.
[4486.95s -> 4490.95s]  Yeah, but I want it to be as an Etsy coin fake.
[4490.95s -> 4492.31s]  It's not like a real tender.
[4493.43s -> 4494.79s]  You know what I'm annoyed with?
[4495.43s -> 4498.31s]  Why on earth over the years did I not listen?
[4499.03s -> 4504.23s]  To those commercials that were on always at two to four o'clock in the morning.
[4505.43s -> 4509.51s]  And this never before minted gold rhino.
[4510.55s -> 4512.55s]  Only $19.99.
[4512.55s -> 4513.91s]  Two for the price of one.
[4513.91s -> 4515.11s]  Why did I not get a bunch of those?
[4517.86s -> 4525.30s]  This 1917 golden rhino was only available for three days until now.
[4525.94s -> 4530.18s]  We allowed four collectors into the vault to find this one piece.
[4530.74s -> 4533.86s]  And it could be yours for a limited time only.
[4533.86s -> 4540.98s]  The first 1,000 callers will get access to the golden 1916 rhino.
[4540.98s -> 4545.56s]  By the way, even if 10,000 people call, you'll all get one.
[4545.56s -> 4549.64s]  This is a way to make old people think they have to hurry the fuck to the telephone
[4549.64s -> 4551.64s]  to call as soon as possible.
[4551.64s -> 4555.08s]  But by the way, the 800 number will stay the same
[4555.08s -> 4559.21s]  over the course of 16 weeks that this commercial airs.
[4559.21s -> 4565.13s]  Hurry, get to a phone line now and reserve your 1917 golden rhino.
[4565.13s -> 4568.78s]  I wish I did.
[4568.78s -> 4569.58s]  Why didn't I do that?
[4574.42s -> 4577.16s]  I want those now.
[4577.16s -> 4577.96s]  And they were huge.
[4577.96s -> 4579.08s]  They were like this big.
[4580.20s -> 4584.20s]  There was a 1917 golden rhino that was this fucking big.
[4587.45s -> 4588.73s]  You'd break your thumb and it would hurt.
[4588.73s -> 4589.53s]  And you have to be careful.
[4589.53s -> 4593.37s]  Like you could break a cheekbone with that thing.
[4593.37s -> 4594.33s]  I want one.
[4594.33s -> 4614.41s]  Penis music.
[4614.41s -> 4616.73s]  Anyways, I want like a big heavy coin.
[4617.45s -> 4618.81s]  I know like, what do you think you are?
[4618.81s -> 4619.29s]  Two fish?
[4619.29s -> 4621.93s]  Like, no, I just think I want them.
[4622.57s -> 4623.77s]  I don't care what they are.
[4623.77s -> 4625.05s]  I'll just I want one.
[4625.05s -> 4641.37s]  All right, somebody made a custom mod for Diablo 2,
[4641.37s -> 4642.89s]  by the way, favorite game of all time.
[4643.93s -> 4645.98s]  The giant enemy spider.
[4647.70s -> 4649.86s]  Demon cursed extra strong spectral hit.
[4649.86s -> 4650.58s]  You got to watch out.
[4651.22s -> 4654.60s]  It's a modded Diablo.
[4655.16s -> 4661.10s]  They also have the giant rat who makes all the rules.
[4662.28s -> 4663.08s]  That's so fun.
[4665.70s -> 4668.02s]  Demon spectral hit cursed extra strong.
[4668.66s -> 4674.17s]  It's a long tagline, too, for a monster name.
[4674.17s -> 4675.05s]  It's funny.
[4675.05s -> 4682.49s]  All the cat police.
[4682.49s -> 4683.69s]  Say the line, Bart.
[4684.49s -> 4686.41s]  I'm the giant rat that makes all the rules.
[4687.13s -> 4689.61s]  See what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into.
[4689.61s -> 4690.17s]  I said it.
[4691.05s -> 4692.76s]  I say I said it.
[4693.56s -> 4694.12s]  I said it.
[4700.57s -> 4702.57s]  I'm the giant rat that makes all the rules.
[4713.62s -> 4716.42s]  And this is, of course, how could I forget
[4716.42s -> 4719.14s]  that this is a Jew wizard reset.
[4720.63s -> 4725.27s]  Red dress with a Diablo 2 paladin scepter.

[4739.16s -> 4743.08s]  and then a Diablo 2 paladin scepter.
[4743.72s -> 4745.96s]  But we're in the game Diablo 2.
[4745.96s -> 4749.64s]  Why does it have to be the Diablo 2 paladin scepter?
[4750.98s -> 4751.94s]  Oh, I love it.
[4751.94s -> 4753.54s]  I love humor.
[4753.54s -> 4755.06s]  Everybody else just love humor.
[4756.42s -> 4760.76s]  It keeps me rolling.
[4760.76s -> 4761.88s]  Monkey sees action.
[4765.88s -> 4767.16s]  Streamer sees action.
[4767.72s -> 4768.89s]  Forgive me.
[4768.89s -> 4770.41s]  Omega Lulz in chat, I guess.
[4778.38s -> 4779.18s]  Forgive me.
[4779.18s -> 4782.14s]  And then Omega Lulz in chat.

[4825.90s -> 4827.82s]  Game is fun until it isn't.
[4827.82s -> 4828.70s]  I mean every game.
[4833.59s -> 4834.87s]  I was about to turn on the effects.
[4835.75s -> 4837.00s]  You weren't going to like it.
[4840.26s -> 4840.74s]  Oh, yeah.

[4850.09s -> 4852.89s]  What about when I beat champion Gundyr first try?
[4852.89s -> 4853.69s]  We forget about those.
[4853.69s -> 4855.13s]  Remember when I beat Dancer first try?
[4855.13s -> 4856.25s]  We don't remember that.
[4857.45s -> 4858.65s]  I'm going to beat the last boss.
[4858.65s -> 4861.93s]  The final actual boss in Sekiro in like a couple hours.
[4861.93s -> 4862.89s]  We forget about that, though.

[4864.17s -> 4864.89s]  No.
[4864.89s -> 4865.77s]  No, no, idiot.

[4907.66s -> 4908.30s]  This is scary.
[4909.02s -> 4911.05s]  There's another greedy grinner.
[4912.70s -> 4914.38s]  See, look at that big ass coin.
[4915.26s -> 4918.62s]  We could make decisions with that coin.
[4918.62s -> 4922.22s]  Imagine if we made stream decisions with like a big gold coin.
[4927.83s -> 4928.47s]  I want one.
[4928.47s -> 4929.11s]  I'm going to get one.

[4931.38s -> 4934.89s]  It's a quarter.
[4934.89s -> 4935.93s]  No, it can't be a quarter.
[4935.93s -> 4939.69s]  It's going to be like a big, at least like half a pound coin.
[4940.25s -> 4942.89s]  That's going to have to wait.
[4942.89s -> 4944.41s]  It's going to be like a quarter inch thick.
[4945.59s -> 4947.75s]  How much is like a quarter inch thick?
[4948.31s -> 4949.91s]  Like a half a pound gold coin?
[4951.18s -> 4951.98s]  Find out.

[4954.22s -> 4956.14s]  One pound of gold is what?
[4958.01s -> 4959.29s]  One pound of gold price.
[4962.23s -> 4967.75s]  One pound of gold today would sell for about $15,000, $18,000.
[4978.41s -> 4978.97s]  Well, okay.
[4979.61s -> 4980.89s]  So can I get a comedy one?
[4982.94s -> 4983.98s]  You can afford that.
[4985.75s -> 4988.31s]  I can't think of things that I'm trying to think of.
[4988.31s -> 4995.03s]  That's a weird flex to like just have this giant fucking like $20,000 coin.
[4995.83s -> 4997.59s]  That would be, that would be pretty fucked up.
[4997.59s -> 4999.27s]  Let me, let me like address you directly here.
[4999.27s -> 5000.31s]  That would be pretty fucked up.
[5001.35s -> 5002.63s]  If I was just the guy.
[5002.63s -> 5003.27s]  Oh, streamer.
[5003.27s -> 5004.23s]  This is what he does.
[5004.23s -> 5009.35s]  He has a $20,000, one inch thick gold coin that he just shows off every day.
[5010.23s -> 5013.40s]  I don't think I want one of those.
[5016.01s -> 5023.90s]  And he flips this, this, this 20 K gold coin to like make stream decisions.
[5028.57s -> 5029.85s]  It's big Reddit gold.
[5030.57s -> 5032.39s]  All right.

[5052.07s -> 5052.39s]  Okay.

[5056.87s -> 5058.07s]  And this has a kangaroo on it.
[5058.87s -> 5059.43s]  Hold on.
[5059.43s -> 5061.67s]  What about one gold coin?

[5098.94s -> 5103.18s]  I could probably find like a, I'm going to get a one pound gold rat coin.
[5103.90s -> 5106.82s]  Why would I ever do that?
[5108.87s -> 5109.75s]  No, I'm going to get it.
[5109.75s -> 5113.43s]  I'm going to get a, um, what's the fool's gold stuff?
[5113.43s -> 5113.91s]  What's it called?
[5113.91s -> 5118.49s]  It's called, uh, arconite.

[5334.07s -> 5334.31s]  What?
[5334.31s -> 5334.87s]  Who cares?
[5335.67s -> 5337.62s]  Cover the vent.
[5337.62s -> 5338.10s]  Yeah.
[5338.10s -> 5338.74s]  What?
[5338.74s -> 5340.58s]  You guys think I'm just going to spray paint the vents?
[5341.22s -> 5342.50s]  I think I'll never turn on.
[5342.50s -> 5343.46s]  It's going to overheat.
[5345.91s -> 5347.83s]  Unscrew the plastic first.
[5347.83s -> 5348.15s]  Yeah.
[5348.15s -> 5348.39s]  Okay.
[5348.39s -> 5349.35s]  That's probably a better idea.
[5349.91s -> 5351.19s]  This is from the iPhone thing.
[5351.99s -> 5356.84s]  I bought a chocolate dipped Wii.
[5357.56s -> 5361.99s]  Let's skip ahead in the soundtrack.
[5361.99s -> 5366.31s]  This is, everybody looks like this in their iPhone.

[5383.77s -> 5384.97s]  That's my question.
[5384.97s -> 5391.18s]  That's not the name of this.
[5391.18s -> 5399.29s]  That's the name of this cow is Murius because Murius is curious, but also furious.
[5399.93s -> 5401.98s]  It's so good.
[5401.98s -> 5403.82s]  Like such a good name.
[5403.82s -> 5410.07s]  You guys are using like a meme name that is like apparently fucked up.
[5410.07s -> 5425.48s]  Not the cow's name.
[5425.48s -> 5427.21s]  That's not the cow's name.
[5428.10s -> 5430.50s]  This is great image, but that's not the cow's name.
[5430.50s -> 5431.62s]  How's name is Murius.
[5432.68s -> 5433.16s]  Change it.

[5463.43s -> 5464.87s]  This is a very, very good image.
[5465.51s -> 5468.98s]  It's great.
[5469.62s -> 5475.16s]  What was the messed up name he's talking about?
[5476.04s -> 5479.24s]  Don't just don't tell them because like I don't want to be the reason
[5479.24s -> 5481.32s]  why that person starts searching shit.
[5482.20s -> 5486.36s]  I like, I don't, I, the stream is not going to be like a place for people to like,
[5486.36s -> 5488.52s]  oh, hey, let's talk about like fucking weird shit.
[5493.19s -> 5493.75s]  Oh, all right.
[5493.75s -> 5494.15s]  Whatever.
[5494.15s -> 5495.51s]  Don't Google anything.
[5497.16s -> 5498.28s]  Don't Google anything ever.
[5498.92s -> 5504.54s]  Here's the thing.
[5504.54s -> 5506.38s]  I don't know if that's my face or not.
[5507.69s -> 5508.65s]  Is that me?
[5508.65s -> 5509.45s]  I don't know.
[5509.45s -> 5510.57s]  Is this just the poster?
[5511.29s -> 5514.50s]  I think this is just the poster.
[5514.50s -> 5515.62s]  I don't think that's even my face.
[5516.34s -> 5523.94s]  Although that would be like, I don't know.
[5523.94s -> 5524.66s]  That would make sense.
[5524.66s -> 5525.62s]  That would be weird.
[5525.62s -> 5526.58s]  The mouth is mine.
[5527.93s -> 5528.25s]  Is it?
[5532.14s -> 5541.42s]  I guess a cast of thousands, thousands of people in this movie.
[5542.06s -> 5544.17s]  Is this public domain?
[5544.17s -> 5544.81s]  Can we watch this?
[5545.37s -> 5550.20s]  Is it public domain?
[5551.08s -> 5552.36s]  Let's see if it's actually me in that.
[5554.81s -> 5556.97s]  I mean, it's not, I'm not fucking.
[5557.05s -> 5558.81s]  90 fucking thousand years old.
[5567.10s -> 5567.82s]  Pretty good.
[5567.82s -> 5568.70s]  Pretty good.
[5568.70s -> 5574.71s]  I like, I like what you did here.
[5577.53s -> 5579.05s]  You skipped the song.
[5579.77s -> 5581.48s]  I did it again.
[5582.52s -> 5583.64s]  This is fucking awesome, though.
[5584.36s -> 5585.16s]  Mustache here.
[5587.37s -> 5587.93s]  Nice work.
[5587.93s -> 5588.81s]  Bloodborne McGee.
[5589.69s -> 5594.76s]  Can I go back to short hair?
[5600.82s -> 5601.70s]  I don't know.
[5601.70s -> 5605.46s]  Let's see what I look.
[5605.46s -> 5607.46s]  I mean, I'm using this as if this is what,
[5607.46s -> 5608.66s]  this is a real image of my face.
[5608.66s -> 5611.14s]  But I mean, it's like, I kind of miss this.
[5626.23s -> 5626.47s]  All right.
[5626.47s -> 5627.51s]  This is, this is a poll.
[5632.79s -> 5633.51s]  Making it right now.
[5665.16s -> 5666.04s]  Flip your coin.
[5666.04s -> 5666.84s]  I don't have one yet.
[5668.12s -> 5673.86s]  Okay.
[5673.86s -> 5676.47s]  Wow.
[5676.47s -> 5678.15s]  This is, this is getting a lot of votes.
[5678.87s -> 5682.22s]  Okay.
[5682.22s -> 5682.46s]  Nice.
[5683.10s -> 5684.22s]  Thousand votes.
[5684.22s -> 5686.46s]  This, we don't break a thousand votes on these polls.
[5686.46s -> 5686.78s]  Ever.
[5687.42s -> 5687.74s]  Ever.
[5692.20s -> 5692.76s]  All right.
[5692.76s -> 5697.83s]  Buy the coin and flip it.
[5697.83s -> 5698.79s]  I need to get one first.
[5699.43s -> 5702.34s]  Link it again.
[5702.34s -> 5702.82s]  Link it again.
[5702.82s -> 5703.06s]  Link.
[5703.06s -> 5703.38s]  All right.
[5703.38s -> 5704.26s]  Here, here, here, here.
[5708.73s -> 5709.37s]  There, there, there.
[5709.37s -> 5709.93s]  Look, look, look.
[5710.57s -> 5712.86s]  This is going to break like 1500 votes.
[5712.86s -> 5713.50s]  It never happens.
[5719.82s -> 5720.46s]  Okay.
[5720.46s -> 5726.15s]  Almost a 2000 votes.
[5726.15s -> 5728.47s]  So you guys, you guys are going nuts.
[5729.43s -> 5731.08s]  All right.
[5731.08s -> 5731.80s]  10 more seconds.
[5736.70s -> 5738.06s]  Gold spray paint here.
[5741.88s -> 5742.20s]  Okay.
[5743.75s -> 5745.03s]  And we're going back to short here.
[5745.91s -> 5748.25s]  I'm glad that I put up the meme filter.
[5748.25s -> 5749.85s]  We could get a real accurate statement
[5749.85s -> 5751.45s]  of what people really thought would be better.
[5755.88s -> 5757.24s]  Going back to short here.
[5757.24s -> 5759.14s]  I was going to anyways, yeah.
[5759.14s -> 5760.50s]  Thanks for the confirmation, visor.
[5761.06s -> 5766.58s]  Appreciate it.
[5767.22s -> 5769.46s]  Thanks for the vote.
[5769.46s -> 5774.50s]  This is another one.
[5774.50s -> 5776.74s]  I just like, it made me chuckle for some reason.
[5776.74s -> 5777.30s]  I don't know why.
[5779.06s -> 5780.58s]  It's just, I look, it made me chuckle.
[5781.22s -> 5782.68s]  This is the BB unit.
[5782.68s -> 5782.92s]  Yes.
[5783.80s -> 5784.84s]  By the way, what the hell?
[5786.34s -> 5786.66s]  Why?
[5787.78s -> 5788.90s]  I guess that's like illegal.
[5790.55s -> 5791.83s]  Yeah, it's like, that's illegal.
[5791.83s -> 5793.75s]  That's like, it's the movie came out literally
[5794.31s -> 5794.95s]  a few, like what?
[5794.95s -> 5795.59s]  Three years ago.
[5796.23s -> 5797.59s]  It just like dubbed me over.
[5798.31s -> 5799.03s]  Now that's illegal.
[5799.03s -> 5799.59s]  Nevermind.
[5799.59s -> 5800.31s]  Can't do that one.
[5801.51s -> 5803.46s]  Uh, this is from the cooking mama stream.
[5804.18s -> 5805.78s]  It was just, uh, I made a pizza
[5805.78s -> 5807.94s]  and it was a shitload of shit.
[5807.94s -> 5810.02s]  Why do people always use this image too?
[5811.14s -> 5815.66s]  It was a corn and strawberry pizza.
[5817.56s -> 5819.40s]  It's a Bitcoin miner.
[5820.20s -> 5821.16s]  That's false.
[5821.16s -> 5822.12s]  That's fake.
[5822.12s -> 5823.40s]  I don't want to push that
[5823.40s -> 5824.52s]  because that's not even real.
[5825.40s -> 5826.20s]  But it doesn't matter.
[5827.00s -> 5841.53s]  Oh, oh, this is the kind of shit
[5841.53s -> 5842.97s]  that you frame and put on your wall.
[5843.69s -> 5845.54s]  And people just assume that this is
[5845.54s -> 5846.98s]  something really, really interesting.
[5848.23s -> 5848.79s]  Oh, wow.
[5849.43s -> 5850.63s]  I won't do that what that is.
[5851.83s -> 5853.75s]  That's in, oh, put that up on your wall.
[5853.75s -> 5855.51s]  And I have a lot of, I'm going to walk by that
[5855.51s -> 5856.79s]  and be like, holy shit.
[5856.79s -> 5858.79s]  That's really interesting and cool to me.
[5858.79s -> 5859.83s]  Even though I don't know what that is.
[5861.03s -> 5861.53s]  Perfect.
[5861.99s -> 5867.58s]  Viewers are plummeting because of this.
[5867.58s -> 5868.30s]  He didn't even talk.
[5868.94s -> 5871.22s]  It's just an image of his face.
[5871.86s -> 5878.98s]  This is great though.
[5878.98s -> 5879.62s]  I love it.
[5879.62s -> 5882.17s]  This is very frameable.
[5882.17s -> 5883.21s]  Very frameable.
[5883.21s -> 5893.21s]  The music is perfect right now.
[5893.21s -> 5893.71s]  Yeah, it is.
[5895.94s -> 5897.06s]  Uh, these are different, um,
[5897.06s -> 5898.34s]  stances of mine, apparently.
[5898.34s -> 5899.06s]  I just thought they would,
[5899.06s -> 5900.34s]  I thought they were cool.
[5900.34s -> 5902.66s]  I mean, I like, I dream of having powers.
[5903.38s -> 5904.26s]  No, everybody does.
[5913.37s -> 5915.21s]  I mean, it's just like, uh, it's like,
[5915.21s -> 5916.09s]  it's cute to me.
[5916.09s -> 5917.05s]  Like, I like it.
[5917.05s -> 5919.67s]  Press Z and wait.
[5919.67s -> 5921.75s]  Dr. Seuss is from, uh, Chibi-Robo.
[5924.94s -> 5927.59s]  I just, it's irritating.
[5927.59s -> 5928.65s]  Okay, we're good.
[5929.45s -> 5931.37s]  It's adorable.
[5935.06s -> 5935.86s]  Play this again.
[5936.66s -> 5937.30s]  I can't.
[5937.30s -> 5938.42s]  It's, I already did.
[5938.42s -> 5939.06s]  I played it all.
[5939.06s -> 5939.70s]  I beat it all.
[5940.50s -> 5941.86s]  It was so good.
[5941.86s -> 5943.06s]  It was awesome.
[5943.06s -> 5944.82s]  And I, I, I can just play it again.
[5944.82s -> 5949.06s]  Five years can go by and I can do it again.
[5949.06s -> 5951.45s]  What about the sequel?
[5951.45s -> 5953.45s]  Yeah, but I have to get a Nintendo DS.
[5954.33s -> 5961.18s]  Um, oh, it's a 1920s movie camera.
[5961.18s -> 5963.58s]  Uh, emulate a DSer thing.
[5964.55s -> 5966.87s]  Um, the thing, a way to play,
[5966.87s -> 5968.95s]  to put it through to my computer.
[5970.42s -> 5971.22s]  Just emulate it.
[5971.22s -> 5972.26s]  Just emulate it.
[5972.26s -> 5973.46s]  Just emulate it.
[5973.46s -> 5974.42s]  Just emulate it.
[5975.30s -> 5976.34s]  Just emulate it.
[5976.34s -> 5979.62s]  Just get every game for free and just emulate, dude.
[5979.62s -> 5980.18s]  Just do it.
[5980.18s -> 5982.26s]  I, what is, what do you got to, where are you afraid?
[5982.26s -> 5983.14s]  Just emulate everything.
[5983.14s -> 5984.42s]  Just don't buy any games.
[5990.82s -> 5991.46s]  Illegal.
[6001.82s -> 6002.30s]  So what?
[6003.88s -> 6009.35s]  Hey, I own it.
[6009.35s -> 6011.19s]  Look, I, I own it.
[6011.75s -> 6013.30s]  I own the console.
[6013.30s -> 6013.94s]  I own the disc.
[6015.56s -> 6016.12s]  I own it.
[6021.94s -> 6022.98s]  Hey, you printed that.
[6022.98s -> 6023.46s]  Oh yeah?
[6024.34s -> 6031.06s]  What are all these games?
[6033.98s -> 6036.62s]  New Avengers, Captain America, Fantastic Four, Iron Man,
[6036.62s -> 6037.58s]  Young Avengers.
[6038.14s -> 6043.08s]  Who's Young Avengers?
[6043.72s -> 6049.02s]  Is it a, how, what game is that?
[6049.82s -> 6055.69s]  Like, is that a game I can play?
[6056.41s -> 6057.29s]  Did I get scammed?
[6057.29s -> 6058.09s]  No, I didn't.
[6058.09s -> 6061.78s]  I'm, look, teacher's copy versus what they give you.
[6065.50s -> 6066.70s]  I hate that image even more.
[6067.26s -> 6074.31s]  It's just scary.
[6074.31s -> 6074.79s]  It's scary.
[6074.79s -> 6076.31s]  Like, why, why did you animate the eyes?
[6076.87s -> 6079.37s]  I love this too.
[6079.37s -> 6083.42s]  It's Chibi-Robo and Fireman.
[6084.14s -> 6085.18s]  Together at last.
[6088.73s -> 6089.29s]  At last.
[6090.01s -> 6094.89s]  Look out.
[6094.89s -> 6096.33s]  It's gonna impale him.
[6097.05s -> 6098.31s]  Why?
[6098.31s -> 6099.03s]  What?
[6099.03s -> 6105.21s]  This OST is too stressful.
[6105.21s -> 6116.34s]  All right, I'll put on fucking relaxation music.
[6117.14s -> 6122.02s]  Has this channel ever been offline?
[6123.22s -> 6125.54s]  Lo-Fi Hip-Hop Beats to Relax 2.
[6125.54s -> 6126.66s]  This channel, I think, is live.
[6129.90s -> 6131.82s]  I think it's, it's literally never been turned off.
[6131.82s -> 6138.78s]  But that's crazy.
[6139.98s -> 6142.09s]  It went offline once.
[6142.09s -> 6142.73s]  Only once.
[6144.01s -> 6144.81s]  Holy shit.
[6144.81s -> 6146.01s]  How many computers do you have?
[6146.65s -> 6149.77s]  How many fucking computers do you have to be able to keep that going?
[6152.94s -> 6154.70s]  Relaxing, how about flute music?
[6157.22s -> 6158.58s]  Mario music.
[6159.14s -> 6161.18s]  This one has a dog on it.
[6161.18s -> 6162.78s]  Classical music for relaxation.
[6163.66s -> 6164.14s]  Chopping.
[6164.94s -> 6166.38s]  Beethoven, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[6166.38s -> 6170.30s]  That's, that's chopping is the, all right, let's try it.
[6183.00s -> 6185.40s]  Did we go over how this is surgery music?
[6186.28s -> 6191.48s]  I can't listen to classical music because it's surgery music.
[6191.48s -> 6197.29s]  Do we ever talk about that?
[6198.01s -> 6198.81s]  Have I ever gone over this?
[6198.81s -> 6199.45s]  Why?
[6199.45s -> 6204.20s]  I have, right?
[6204.20s -> 6206.47s]  I've never gone over this.
[6206.47s -> 6207.27s]  Explain, explain.
[6209.75s -> 6211.51s]  Okay, so yeah, like dentist music.
[6211.51s -> 6214.81s]  Yeah, I want, I, I had my wisdom teeth pulled.
[6215.53s -> 6218.33s]  And I was kind of put under anesthesia for it.
[6219.29s -> 6221.21s]  And this music was just playing.
[6222.54s -> 6226.54s]  Guy just had classical music playing while he was pulling my teeth.
[6227.83s -> 6230.47s]  And it was crazy because like, obviously you could, you get,
[6230.47s -> 6233.11s]  when I was putting, getting put under the sedation, it was like,
[6234.36s -> 6236.36s]  the song, it was scary.
[6238.52s -> 6244.84s]  It was like going, and that's just classical, classical, classical.
[6245.48s -> 6248.79s]  This is surgery music.
[6249.43s -> 6253.11s]  I've had two procedures and there's, this always plays.
[6253.75s -> 6256.90s]  There's always like a fucking surgery song.
[6256.90s -> 6268.23s]  Yeah, like this is like, and they like get in there and
[6269.11s -> 6276.87s]  Hannibal did that.
[6279.06s -> 6279.86s]  See, right?
[6280.42s -> 6283.26s]  He's got a classical music phobia.
[6283.26s -> 6291.43s]  And I think it gets angry too.
[6292.39s -> 6294.15s]  You know, you notice how it's like boom.
[6294.15s -> 6297.27s]  You can tell when he like fucking pushes hard down on the fucking keys.
[6297.27s -> 6297.83s]  Listen, ready?
[6298.39s -> 6303.54s]  It's like, you can hear his hands hit the bottom of the wood on the piano.
[6304.10s -> 6306.30s]  Where is it?
[6309.02s -> 6310.31s]  Where is it?
[6310.31s -> 6319.78s]  You can feel the wood getting hit.
[6333.80s -> 6334.36s]  It's angry.
[6335.56s -> 6336.12s]  I don't like it.
[6337.64s -> 6338.20s]  It's wonderful.
[6338.84s -> 6343.80s]  It's created so magically and the skill that it takes to be able to do that.
[6343.80s -> 6347.96s]  And the concentration and how it flows against like a story in a song.
[6347.96s -> 6348.44s]  I get it.
[6348.44s -> 6352.68s]  But I've had my, I've had teeth pulled twice and the surgery music.
[6352.68s -> 6353.72s]  And I think that's all I can think of now.
[6354.28s -> 6361.70s]  It's beautiful.
[6363.06s -> 6365.18s]  Play MF Doom.
[6365.82s -> 6366.98s]  That's copyright.
[6368.02s -> 6370.74s]  That's copyright.
[6371.94s -> 6376.70s]  I mean, too bad.
[6376.70s -> 6377.20s]  What?
[6377.66s -> 6385.61s]  Hey, play copyright music.
[6385.61s -> 6386.57s]  No, too bad.
[6387.37s -> 6388.14s]  Okay.
[6388.14s -> 6389.42s]  Anything else you like me to do?
[6390.14s -> 6390.64s]  Okay.
[6391.18s -> 6391.68s]  Sure.
[6392.46s -> 6394.47s]  Do a movie soundtrack.
[6394.47s -> 6394.71s]  All right.
[6394.71s -> 6395.75s]  How about Inception?
[6396.39s -> 6413.13s]  Now, this is surgery music.
[6413.13s -> 6414.09s]  I don't like it.
[6414.09s -> 6416.09s]  That's surgery music.
[6416.09s -> 6416.59s]  I don't like it.
[6418.66s -> 6419.88s]  That's copyrighted.
[6419.88s -> 6420.20s]  Fuck.
[6420.20s -> 6420.60s]  I know.
[6421.24s -> 6421.72s]  All right.
[6421.72s -> 6423.64s]  How about put on jazz?
[6423.64s -> 6425.16s]  Jazz royalty free.
[6425.80s -> 6429.14s]  Coffee house jazz.
[6435.05s -> 6439.96s]  Go ahead and pull up to the coffee shop.
[6439.96s -> 6440.92s]  All right.
[6440.92s -> 6445.16s]  Just find your self standing in line.
[6445.16s -> 6447.16s]  Getting to order a nice hot cup of coffee.
[6447.80s -> 6449.69s]  You got it.
[6450.33s -> 6451.29s]  What's that smell?
[6451.29s -> 6451.93s]  Cappuccino.
[6452.49s -> 6453.69s]  Freshly brewed.
[6453.69s -> 6458.10s]  You look around the coffee shop and you look for a place to sit down.
[6458.10s -> 6460.10s]  But something catches your eye.
[6461.26s -> 6466.78s]  And every single available seat is a man or woman with their computer.
[6468.06s -> 6472.38s]  And they may have been sitting there for two to three hours at this point.
[6472.38s -> 6474.94s]  No place to sit.
[6476.34s -> 6478.66s]  Just computers and typing sounds.
[6479.30s -> 6484.78s]  You think to say, how long have these people been here for?
[6486.86s -> 6489.02s]  And is my money worth the same as theirs?
[6489.02s -> 6491.51s]  But you don't.
[6491.51s -> 6492.31s]  You just walk out.
[6493.62s -> 6494.74s]  Thought you'd like to have a seat.
[6495.30s -> 6498.89s]  But you can't.
[6498.89s -> 6500.09s]  You take that coffee into the car.
[6501.94s -> 6506.02s]  You sit down and you figure out, how am I going to drink this coffee in this car?
[6507.40s -> 6508.12s]  Gosh.
[6508.12s -> 6509.00s]  You turn the engine on.
[6509.56s -> 6511.37s]  Oh, what's that?
[6511.37s -> 6512.81s]  You put it down in the cup holder.
[6512.81s -> 6514.09s]  A little bit spilt on your hand.
[6515.61s -> 6516.33s]  Dripped on the ground.
[6517.05s -> 6518.57s]  Nice leather.
[6519.21s -> 6520.78s]  Car's got to get detailed now.
[6522.71s -> 6524.09s]  Chucks.
[6524.09s -> 6526.81s]  Really would have liked a seat at that coffee shop.
[6527.77s -> 6530.36s]  You repeat in your head over and over again as you drive.
[6531.16s -> 6531.72s]  Angry now.
[6532.28s -> 6534.90s]  Coffee's supposed to relax you and slow you down.
[6535.70s -> 6537.83s]  Except that's absolutely not true.
[6537.83s -> 6538.95s]  Caffeine makes you speed up.
[6540.25s -> 6540.73s]  Slow down.
[6541.45s -> 6543.18s]  It's a red light.
[6552.01s -> 6553.05s]  I don't want, I don't like that music.
[6554.01s -> 6555.19s]  All right.
[6555.19s -> 6555.67s]  That's better.
[6556.98s -> 6558.02s]  He's not insane.
[6558.90s -> 6567.10s]  Would you get the Evangelion figurines?
[6567.10s -> 6568.38s]  I, I fucking eBay.
[6568.38s -> 6568.70s]  I don't know.
[6568.70s -> 6569.10s]  Look them up.
[6569.74s -> 6573.67s]  Irma, do funny, do funny, do funny.
[6573.67s -> 6575.83s]  This is, why is this just like my life?
[6577.98s -> 6579.02s]  Not insane.
[6579.66s -> 6580.94s]  And that's the Spider-Man meme.
[6581.58s -> 6587.83s]  Irma, what, like 35 minutes into my ass, a gnome is just sitting there.
[6588.79s -> 6589.99s]  But that's out of context.
[6590.63s -> 6592.60s]  We were, that's out of context.
[6592.60s -> 6593.24s]  I got to, hold on.
[6593.24s -> 6595.02s]  Let me defend myself on that.
[6595.02s -> 6598.14s]  That's what I was talking about if I streamed my colonoscopy.
[6599.19s -> 6603.19s]  And if elaborate, just elaborately, somewhere on that video.
[6603.19s -> 6605.59s]  After like, because a colonoscopy takes like half an hour.
[6606.23s -> 6608.63s]  That I just put a gnome on in there.
[6608.63s -> 6610.71s]  Like not in, not obviously not in there.
[6610.79s -> 6612.07s]  But like on the screen.
[6612.07s -> 6615.75s]  Like there was just a gnome like going through the colonoscopy is real boring.
[6615.75s -> 6617.51s]  It's just a, it's just a tunnel.
[6619.40s -> 6621.56s]  And all this, it's okay.
[6621.56s -> 6624.76s]  It's just, we're just in this guy's intestines.
[6624.76s -> 6627.40s]  Oh, there's a, there's a gnome there and they just pass it.
[6629.53s -> 6630.97s]  This needs to be context here.
[6631.94s -> 6632.66s]  I'm not crazy.
[6633.46s -> 6633.94s]  Context.
[6634.74s -> 6635.30s]  This is great.
[6635.94s -> 6654.82s]  Pretty good.
[6654.82s -> 6657.11s]  Oh, we've got Jazzy in here.
[6660.50s -> 6661.30s]  Is this the Hulk?
[6662.02s -> 6664.66s]  Um, I don't think so.
[6664.66s -> 6665.22s]  The Hulk.
[6667.80s -> 6668.84s]  It's green meat.
[6669.80s -> 6670.52s]  It's the Grinch.
[6673.18s -> 6674.06s]  It's the Grinch.
[6674.94s -> 6678.31s]  It looks great.
[6678.31s -> 6678.63s]  Whatever.
[6678.63s -> 6679.43s]  It looks great.
[6680.90s -> 6681.54s]  Love the eyes.
[6685.75s -> 6686.39s]  Well, I don't know.
[6687.27s -> 6688.15s]  It's Beast Boy.
[6688.15s -> 6689.27s]  It's whoever you want it to be.
[6690.23s -> 6691.35s]  Use your imagination.
[6695.10s -> 6695.74s]  Great.
[6695.74s -> 6697.50s]  Top 1000 stream.
[6697.50s -> 6698.14s]  What am I at now?
[6698.78s -> 6701.32s]  What am I at now?
[6702.04s -> 6707.10s]  What is it?
[6707.10s -> 6708.86s]  Well, I was a top 1000 stream before.
[6709.34s -> 6710.38s]  What's the, what's the rank now?
[6710.38s -> 6710.94s]  What am I at now?
[6712.30s -> 6713.26s]  Did I go down or up?
[6714.14s -> 6720.09s]  I was at like 840 or something, right?
[6720.09s -> 6720.89s]  810.
[6721.77s -> 6723.48s]  I went down.
[6726.36s -> 6727.72s]  467.
[6728.36s -> 6730.68s]  Wait, I jumped up to 467?
[6736.71s -> 6737.43s]  Did I?
[6737.43s -> 6742.33s]  I don't think we, is that real?
[6743.13s -> 6745.90s]  I think we have to, we have to get rid of this top 1000 streamer.
[6745.90s -> 6747.42s]  We're going to have to go with top 500.
[6748.06s -> 6749.10s]  Top 500 streamer.
[6752.52s -> 6754.49s]  Okay.
[6754.49s -> 6756.73s]  You're at 808 for follower rank.
[6757.53s -> 6759.62s]  Top 476.
[6764.46s -> 6764.78s]  Nice.
[6765.66s -> 6766.46s]  Top 500.
[6767.18s -> 6768.14s]  I'm 500.
[6771.46s -> 6771.78s]  Yeah.
[6773.69s -> 6775.29s]  I, I, I did it.
[6776.09s -> 6776.73s]  I did it.
[6777.98s -> 6778.62s]  I did it.
[6779.85s -> 6780.35s]  Me.
[6781.05s -> 6789.24s]  Hey, look, it's Pluto.
[6789.24s -> 6790.44s]  Ego fucking mania.
[6791.50s -> 6793.10s]  Hey, it's Pluto in 1994.
[6793.10s -> 6794.30s]  Now we got a good image of it.
[6797.77s -> 6798.41s]  Bury me.
[6798.41s -> 6799.69s]  Bury me with my money.
[6799.69s -> 6801.29s]  Bury me with my sub count.
[6804.58s -> 6806.90s]  Thank you, East Waffles, for the fives.
[6808.07s -> 6808.39s]  Money.
[6809.03s -> 6811.06s]  Thanks for the five community subs.
[6811.06s -> 6813.86s]  Thank you, Ms. Jackie, for the five community subs.
[6814.50s -> 6815.48s]  Money.
[6819.08s -> 6819.40s]  Yes.
[6822.52s -> 6824.68s]  Five, his ego's getting bigger.
[6825.85s -> 6826.73s]  No, it's not.
[6826.73s -> 6827.37s]  I'm just kidding.
[6827.37s -> 6827.93s]  It's a joke.
[6831.24s -> 6832.68s]  That's Pluto in 2018.
[6832.68s -> 6833.88s]  Can we see some Pluto's please?
[6835.16s -> 6835.96s]  Music's too loud.
[6835.96s -> 6838.52s]  I'm just, I can't find the right place for it.
[6838.52s -> 6841.16s]  Half this soundtrack is really loud and half it's really soft.
[6847.61s -> 6848.49s]  There it is.
[6848.49s -> 6851.08s]  Pluto.
[6851.08s -> 6851.80s]  Would you look at this?
[6853.19s -> 6854.71s]  I gotta get off camera for this one so you can see it.
[6855.75s -> 6857.27s]  This is my D&D character.
[6857.91s -> 6861.16s]  Rat King German, 985th of his name.
[6862.52s -> 6863.08s]  Stats.
[6863.08s -> 6863.56s]  TV.
[6863.56s -> 6864.04s]  Strength.
[6865.14s -> 6866.02s]  Strength is TV.
[6866.02s -> 6867.22s]  Dexterity is dab.
[6867.22s -> 6868.34s]  Constitution is heart.
[6868.90s -> 6870.02s]  Intelligence is high.
[6870.02s -> 6870.50s]  Wisdom.
[6870.50s -> 6871.06s]  Oh, I see.
[6873.40s -> 6873.88s]  Alignment.
[6873.88s -> 6874.60s]  Chaotic evil.
[6874.60s -> 6875.08s]  That's not true.
[6877.62s -> 6880.22s]  Oh, I have disciplined emotional.
[6881.02s -> 6882.14s]  Halfling Warlock.
[6886.33s -> 6887.29s]  Play your name.
[6887.29s -> 6887.77s]  Whatever.
[6887.85s -> 6888.17s]  Height.
[6888.17s -> 6888.81s]  Compact.
[6891.98s -> 6892.62s]  Inventory.
[6892.62s -> 6893.82s]  Crown of bits.
[6893.82s -> 6895.50s]  A crown made, let's see.
[6895.50s -> 6896.62s]  Let's get in there so you can see.
[6897.72s -> 6901.24s]  Crown made of bits that were generously donated by fans.
[6901.24s -> 6906.52s]  The unnecessarily large size of his crown inflates the already gigantic ego of the wearer.
[6909.53s -> 6910.49s]  Gamer certificate.
[6910.49s -> 6911.61s]  Grants permission to Jex.
[6912.33s -> 6915.37s]  Informs common casuals of the wearer's elite gaming status.
[6916.01s -> 6916.97s]  A spie knife.
[6916.97s -> 6917.53s]  A comb.
[6917.53s -> 6918.25s]  And a light gun.
[6918.89s -> 6920.73s]  Exactly two and a half bald coin.
[6921.67s -> 6922.79s]  Five common rats.
[6923.51s -> 6927.11s]  One giant rat who makes all the rules and one uncommon good rat.
[6927.11s -> 6928.15s]  It's not Otto.
[6929.03s -> 6930.07s]  What is it, Otto?
[6930.71s -> 6934.98s]  Abilities.
[6935.70s -> 6937.22s]  You're doing a great job.
[6938.81s -> 6939.61s]  Summon, hold on.
[6942.68s -> 6945.96s]  Summon an ethereal being that begins to chant encouraging words.
[6945.96s -> 6948.68s]  Plus one to pride and plus one to gaming ability.
[6949.40s -> 6951.00s]  The master of comedy.
[6951.00s -> 6954.46s]  When character makes an intelligent and funny joke plus two to all stats.
[6954.46s -> 6955.58s]  That's pretty good.
[6955.58s -> 6959.82s]  But yeah, when character makes a bad joke, minus two to all stats.
[6964.26s -> 6964.82s]  Free shit.
[6964.82s -> 6967.78s]  Once a day, character can summon a random item into the inventory.
[6967.78s -> 6970.10s]  This item always is worthless and has no use.
[6971.46s -> 6972.82s]  And then my ultimate ability.
[6973.62s -> 6974.66s]  Summon Bugleberry.
[6975.30s -> 6976.66s]  Summons Bugleberry.
[6976.66s -> 6980.26s]  Both friendly and enemy characters nearby get bored and leave.
[6980.98s -> 6982.18s]  Oh shit.
[6984.25s -> 6994.57s]  Well, this is awesome.
[6994.57s -> 6995.21s]  Good shit.
[6998.39s -> 6999.83s]  Plus two to all stats.
[7002.18s -> 7003.30s]  Oh, that would be so bad.
[7003.30s -> 7006.58s]  You know, if you guys think about how passive buffs and debuffs would just hurt.
[7007.14s -> 7008.26s]  And life would just suck.
[7009.35s -> 7014.87s]  Can you imagine if you just all of a sudden you did some random act or some random reason.
[7014.87s -> 7017.03s]  You had a ring in your inventory that increased like your,
[7017.59s -> 7019.99s]  like increased your intelligence by plus five randomly.
[7021.00s -> 7023.32s]  Or it could take, you know, minus five or something.
[7023.32s -> 7024.20s]  That would be horrible.
[7025.08s -> 7026.87s]  You'd be walking around.
[7026.87s -> 7029.99s]  You'd be like driving your car and you'd get hit by the debuff.
[7029.99s -> 7032.55s]  And you just wouldn't be able to drive your fucking car anymore.
[7032.55s -> 7033.27s]  You'd have to.
[7033.27s -> 7034.63s]  I don't know how to do this.
[7034.63s -> 7041.19s]  It'd be terrible.
[7041.19s -> 7042.63s]  Zoom in on the chest.
[7042.63s -> 7046.89s]  The gamer license.
[7049.50s -> 7054.33s]  Comb as a gamer necklace.
[7057.98s -> 7058.70s]  Good shit.
[7058.70s -> 7059.02s]  Awesome.
[7062.65s -> 7064.09s]  And that's it for the art.
[7064.09s -> 7067.77s]  Up until the beginning of March, I'm going to move on to videos now.
[7069.40s -> 7070.20s]  Video files.
[7070.76s -> 7076.58s]  But before we do that, I'm going to go take a pee and refill my hamster drink.
[7077.30s -> 7078.22s]  Be right back.
[7297.72s -> 7299.00s]  Anthony Wendell.
[7300.79s -> 7302.78s]  Jazz musician.
[7302.78s -> 7304.63s]  Only 22 years old.
[7304.63s -> 7305.59s]  You could believe it.
[7305.59s -> 7308.47s]  The album's available today.
[7309.03s -> 7311.48s]  As we come back here.
[7311.48s -> 7312.92s]  Let's talk.
[7315.96s -> 7320.14s]  So today we're going to move to the video section.
[7321.59s -> 7323.61s]  Right now.
[7323.61s -> 7324.33s]  Radio joke.
[7324.33s -> 7325.69s]  Oh my god, we're radio joke.
[7325.69s -> 7327.21s]  Oh my god, we're radio joke.
[7328.09s -> 7328.57s]  No.
[7328.57s -> 7329.13s]  All right, let's go.
[7333.29s -> 7334.73s]  We are going to move to the videos.
[7334.73s -> 7336.33s]  The first one is called Darth Jerma.
[7336.33s -> 7337.21s]  I already know what this one is.
[7337.21s -> 7338.09s]  I don't even have to watch it.
[7338.81s -> 7339.53s]  But here we go.
[7340.09s -> 7346.54s]  I already know what this is.
[7346.54s -> 7347.58s]  I already know what this is.
[7347.58s -> 7363.16s]  Oh, by the way, if you've never seen Star Wars, this is a Star Wars spoiler, I guess.
[7363.80s -> 7365.24s]  This is the part of the movie Star Wars.
[7366.04s -> 7368.04s]  And you know who Darth Vader is, right?
[7368.04s -> 7368.60s]  You know that.
[7368.60s -> 7370.84s]  But like, you might not know anything else.
[7370.84s -> 7373.56s]  This is a potential spoiler for the movie Star Wars.
[7373.56s -> 7374.36s]  Okay.
[7374.36s -> 7378.15s]  By the way, I have to say this every time we do this.
[7378.15s -> 7381.43s]  If you've ever watched a TV show in your life, just be careful.
[7381.43s -> 7383.19s]  Because this like, I'm going to try.
[7383.75s -> 7386.23s]  But this, no, no, I'm being serious.
[7386.71s -> 7390.39s]  I got like a direct message like a year ago that was like, dude, you really have like
[7390.39s -> 7391.35s]  spoiled a movie for me.
[7391.35s -> 7392.63s]  And I'm just like, all right, I got to be careful now.
[7392.63s -> 7393.67s]  One guy had power.
[7393.67s -> 7421.08s]  Oh, got it.
[7423.96s -> 7425.72s]  We all knew what this was.
[7425.72s -> 7428.84s]  I don't know who, everybody knows what that was.
[7428.84s -> 7431.48s]  I didn't have to pretend like, there's no way.
[7431.48s -> 7434.28s]  You know what would be funny if that's what, if that was not what it was.
[7436.66s -> 7437.54s]  Got it.
[7437.54s -> 7439.59s]  Bro, that was a spoiler.
[7440.23s -> 7445.85s]  Okay, coming up next.
[7446.41s -> 7451.96s]  This is called the Elf Jerma Picnic.
[7461.21s -> 7463.21s]  Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[7464.17s -> 7464.67s]  Yeah.
[7466.41s -> 7466.91s]  Yes.
[7467.61s -> 7468.11s]  Hey.
[7469.26s -> 7469.76s]  You.
[7470.74s -> 7471.30s]  What?
[7471.30s -> 7478.10s]  It's time for you to come look at me.
[7478.10s -> 7478.60s]  Shut up.
[7481.11s -> 7482.31s]  I'll be going this way now.
[7482.95s -> 7486.20s]  What a gamer.
[7486.20s -> 7490.34s]  You know, my mother always told me, be a good boy.
[7492.17s -> 7492.67s]  Yeah.
[7494.65s -> 7501.26s]  Taking you guys on the scenic route.
[7506.15s -> 7507.43s]  What were you expecting?
[7507.43s -> 7508.55s]  Super frog.
[7508.63s -> 7509.27s]  Oh, I was.
[7509.27s -> 7510.23s]  How could you not like it?
[7510.23s -> 7511.03s]  It's got candy.
[7513.50s -> 7514.14s]  Small.
[7514.14s -> 7515.10s]  Get a big spider.
[7515.10s -> 7515.74s]  Hello.
[7515.74s -> 7519.22s]  I've heard some nice things about you.
[7519.22s -> 7520.90s]  I have nothing to do with this.
[7521.70s -> 7523.50s]  I was just trying to go to the bathroom.
[7529.67s -> 7531.46s]  Fuck you.
[7531.46s -> 7533.40s]  I'm the man.
[7533.40s -> 7533.90s]  Hey, mom.
[7534.44s -> 7535.16s]  Mom, I see it.
[7537.06s -> 7537.56s]  Yeah.
[7537.56s -> 7538.06s]  Wow.
[7546.87s -> 7547.37s]  Look.
[7548.06s -> 7548.78s]  That's fucked up.
[7549.58s -> 7550.14s]  Look.
[7550.14s -> 7551.34s]  Why is it a fucking Egypt?
[7551.34s -> 7552.38s]  What? No, no, no.
[7552.38s -> 7555.42s]  No, it's Egypt and we're both flog pyros.
[7555.42s -> 7555.92s]  No.
[7556.32s -> 7562.06s]  I think this one's on here.
[7562.06s -> 7563.90s]  This one's on here, I think.
[7563.90s -> 7566.64s]  All right.
[7566.64s -> 7568.00s]  Well, that was that one.
[7568.00s -> 7569.48s]  German picnic.
[7569.48s -> 7570.68s]  The best part was you.
[7571.24s -> 7573.08s]  It's time for you to look at me.
[7574.20s -> 7575.48s]  Very good use.
[7575.48s -> 7576.20s]  Very good use.
[7577.00s -> 7579.42s]  Give this one a link.
[7579.42s -> 7579.82s]  This one.
[7579.82s -> 7580.62s]  Okay, here.
[7580.62s -> 7582.99s]  Don't give any spoilers.
[7583.55s -> 7586.22s]  Here's the link to that one.
[7586.78s -> 7589.18s]  Hang on.
[7590.75s -> 7594.09s]  This one's called German gets down.
[7595.37s -> 7597.42s]  It's down.
[7598.78s -> 7600.89s]  This could be a dancing number.
[7615.90s -> 7630.41s]  I don't know what it is.
[7632.89s -> 7642.36s]  I can't believe I did all of these.
[7642.36s -> 7645.20s]  I really can't believe I did all of these.
[7645.76s -> 7651.39s]  This really was like your grandfather when you're like,
[7651.39s -> 7652.91s]  hey, grandpa, do this move.
[7652.91s -> 7654.75s]  And he's like, okay, I don't know what that is.
[7654.75s -> 7656.27s]  But are you sure, son?
[7656.83s -> 7664.48s]  Disable auto play.
[7664.48s -> 7665.04s]  I forgot.
[7665.60s -> 7667.44s]  I did on the last like six.
[7667.44s -> 7669.84s]  But I didn't on the these ones because I forgot.
[7669.84s -> 7672.00s]  And this like it's like 60 videos.
[7672.00s -> 7672.80s]  So I forgot.
[7672.80s -> 7674.00s]  That's too bad for me.
[7674.00s -> 7675.04s]  And for you apparently too,
[7675.04s -> 7676.00s]  because you have to deal with the two.
[7676.00s -> 7676.64s]  I'm sorry about that.
[7676.64s -> 7677.28s]  But that's the way it is.
[7677.28s -> 7678.00s]  Let's keep going.
[7678.00s -> 7678.88s]  No spoilers here.
[7679.44s -> 7682.81s]  Oh, these.
[7682.81s -> 7684.89s]  Okay, these next couple are very, very interesting.
[7685.61s -> 7689.29s]  These next couple are animations of the rats,
[7689.29s -> 7690.25s]  as you'll see in a second.
[7691.48s -> 7692.20s]  That old intro.
[7692.20s -> 7693.16s]  Take a look at this.
[7693.16s -> 7694.92s]  Cute rat characters in a marching band.
[7719.50s -> 7726.14s]  Rats don't chat.
[7726.14s -> 7727.34s]  We pray at night.
[7727.34s -> 7728.46s]  We stomp at night.
[7732.08s -> 7733.92s]  Rats don't rest.
[7734.80s -> 7738.35s]  We stomp at night.
[7738.35s -> 7739.93s]  We pray at night.
[7739.93s -> 7740.97s]  We stomp at night.
[7740.97s -> 7742.17s]  We pray at night.
[7742.17s -> 7743.45s]  We stomp at night.
[7743.45s -> 7748.83s]  We're rats, rats, rats, rats, rats.
[7748.83s -> 7753.55s]  Oh, the giant rat that makes all of the rules.
[7753.55s -> 7756.11s]  Giant rat, giant rat.
[7756.11s -> 7761.28s]  I'm so glad you said thank you.
[7761.28s -> 7769.56s]  Thank you for this.
[7770.84s -> 7773.55s]  Oh, is this?
[7773.55s -> 7774.59s]  That's what this is.
[7774.59s -> 7774.91s]  Okay.
[7776.11s -> 7777.29s]  All right.
[7777.29s -> 7781.53s]  The next one is also auto plays off.
[7781.53s -> 7781.85s]  I know.
[7782.73s -> 7784.09s]  Same thing, but it was a different edition.
[7784.73s -> 7789.23s]  Spoilers.
[7789.23s -> 7789.63s]  All right.
[7789.63s -> 7789.95s]  Fine.
[7789.95s -> 7790.35s]  Spoiler.
[7790.35s -> 7790.67s]  I know.
[7790.67s -> 7790.91s]  Fine.
[7791.87s -> 7792.35s]  I told you.
[7792.35s -> 7792.67s]  I know.
[7792.67s -> 7793.15s]  Tabs.
[7793.15s -> 7793.55s]  I know.
[7806.68s -> 7827.32s]  Giant rat coming this one, too.
[7828.12s -> 7837.72s]  All right.
[7837.72s -> 7838.20s]  There he is.
[7842.11s -> 7842.99s]  Giant rat.
[7846.83s -> 7848.35s]  Again, again, do it again.
[7849.23s -> 7850.11s]  Rample them again.
[7850.11s -> 7850.67s]  Do it again.
[7853.07s -> 7857.92s]  It's time for you to kick to the sixth or beat.
[7858.72s -> 7861.20s]  This song makes it impossible to really get it right with anything.
[7862.16s -> 7862.72s]  Is that what it is?
[7863.76s -> 7864.00s]  Four?
[7864.64s -> 7865.64s]  I don't even know.
[7867.04s -> 7867.68s]  No spoilers.
[7867.68s -> 7868.40s]  Fine.
[7868.40s -> 7872.62s]  I'm up next is one.
[7872.62s -> 7876.54s]  This is called the green screen DLC waiting room.
[7876.54s -> 7882.75s]  Off to a great start on this one.
[7886.12s -> 7887.24s]  Here it comes.
[7888.62s -> 7890.06s]  We have first up.
[7890.86s -> 7891.74s]  Jerma.
[7891.74s -> 7892.30s]  That's me.
[7892.30s -> 7893.42s]  Jerma985.
[7893.42s -> 7894.30s]  Y'all know who I am.
[7894.86s -> 7896.06s]  Do I need an introduction?
[7919.34s -> 7920.78s]  Um, what the fuck?
[7920.78s -> 7923.44s]  Hey, if I lean back, can you spit in my mouth?
[7923.76s -> 7924.32s]  Piss on me.
[7924.32s -> 7924.80s]  Piss it.
[7924.80s -> 7925.76s]  Piss in my face.
[7925.76s -> 7926.16s]  Do it.
[7926.16s -> 7926.72s]  I'm fine.
[7926.72s -> 7927.76s]  I can hold my breath.
[7927.76s -> 7930.96s]  He's going to go sit down on the toilet and piss up into my face.
[7931.95s -> 7936.24s]  I think about, um, I think eating going on a diet.
[7936.24s -> 7936.88s]  It's not a bad idea.
[7936.88s -> 7938.56s]  My calculations are correct.
[7938.56s -> 7938.88s]  Hold on.
[7938.88s -> 7939.44s]  Wait, wait, hold on.
[7939.44s -> 7940.64s]  Be a virgin, right?
[7941.52s -> 7943.44s]  I meant Virgo.
[7944.56s -> 7945.12s]  Sorry.
[7945.12s -> 7947.04s]  I know Virgos are very sensitive.
[7951.68s -> 7952.64s]  Oh, my God.
[7953.36s -> 7953.84s]  You see that?
[7953.84s -> 7954.96s]  Look at these Pogchamps.
[7962.00s -> 7962.48s]  All right.
[7962.48s -> 7962.96s]  All right.
[7962.96s -> 7963.28s]  Okay.
[7965.68s -> 7966.08s]  Easy.
[7966.08s -> 7967.76s]  Do I eat penis?
[7967.76s -> 7968.48s]  Of course I do.
[7970.96s -> 7971.60s]  Okay.
[7971.60s -> 7972.24s]  All right.
[7972.24s -> 7972.88s]  Okay.
[7972.88s -> 7973.76s]  Okay.
[7973.76s -> 7974.16s]  Okay.
[7974.72s -> 7975.20s]  Okay.
[7975.84s -> 7976.24s]  Okay.
[7977.12s -> 7977.44s]  Good.
[7978.08s -> 7979.92s]  Very good.
[7979.92s -> 7980.72s]  Good.
[7980.72s -> 7981.12s]  Great.
[7981.68s -> 7982.40s]  Yes.
[7982.40s -> 7983.36s]  Oh, okay.
[7983.36s -> 7984.64s]  I'm happy.
[7984.64s -> 7985.76s]  We're happy.
[7985.76s -> 7986.64s]  We're happy.
[7986.64s -> 7987.36s]  Okay.
[7987.36s -> 7988.40s]  We're very happy.
[7988.40s -> 7988.80s]  We're...
[7988.80s -> 7989.76s]  All right.
[7989.76s -> 7990.08s]  Okay.
[7993.31s -> 7994.75s]  Oh, God damn it.
[7995.79s -> 7999.58s]  Turn it up.
[7999.58s -> 8001.23s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[8001.23s -> 8001.79s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[8001.79s -> 8003.10s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[8003.10s -> 8003.74s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[8003.74s -> 8004.06s]  Oh, yeah.
[8004.06s -> 8006.43s]  What the fuck, man?
[8030.94s -> 8031.10s]  Okay.
[8031.10s -> 8031.90s]  We're done with this one.
[8031.90s -> 8032.62s]  That one was fun.
[8032.62s -> 8032.94s]  Thank you.
[8033.58s -> 8034.14s]  Thank you.
[8034.14s -> 8034.70s]  Okay.
[8034.70s -> 8035.18s]  Yeah.
[8035.18s -> 8035.74s]  Good.
[8035.74s -> 8036.62s]  What else is on here?
[8036.62s -> 8036.94s]  Okay.
[8036.94s -> 8037.66s]  Sure.

[8040.54s -> 8041.04s]  Okay.
[8042.38s -> 8042.88s]  Okay.
[8044.24s -> 8045.12s]  What the fuck?
[8045.68s -> 8047.04s]  No, it's not an emote.
[8047.04s -> 8047.84s]  Still, you're right.
[8050.91s -> 8051.71s]  Yes, it's not.
[8056.20s -> 8057.08s]  Jesus.
[8057.08s -> 8058.84s]  Fucking crack night.
[8058.84s -> 8060.67s]  You want a link to this one?
[8060.67s -> 8061.31s]  Okay.
[8061.31s -> 8061.79s]  Fine.
[8061.79s -> 8062.03s]  Sure.
[8063.15s -> 8063.63s]  There you go.
[8064.27s -> 8065.15s]  That was a video.
[8067.10s -> 8068.06s]  My God.
[8073.13s -> 8073.61s]  Okay.
[8073.61s -> 8074.41s]  This one's called,
[8074.41s -> 8076.01s]  is Jerma real?
[8076.01s -> 8077.45s]  Well, we'll find out soon enough.
[8078.41s -> 8082.88s]  So, those of you that said this was not real.
[8083.52s -> 8084.90s]  It is.
[8085.52s -> 8087.61s]  It's very real.
[8091.76s -> 8092.16s]  Okay.
[8092.16s -> 8094.00s]  Now, wrap it up, Jeremias.
[8094.00s -> 8095.52s]  We had enough of our shit today.
[8095.52s -> 8097.76s]  Not only you tried to sell us a wallet,
[8097.76s -> 8100.24s]  but also played Firewatch for three days.
[8100.24s -> 8103.12s]  SDR8 now play Poi Poi on the PS1.
[8103.12s -> 8106.64s]  Oh, is that just a game request?
[8106.64s -> 8111.47s]  Hold on.
[8111.47s -> 8113.31s]  Did I get baited into watching a video?
[8113.31s -> 8114.59s]  But it's a game request.
[8115.31s -> 8123.52s]  Thanks.
[8124.96s -> 8125.52s]  Okay.
[8125.52s -> 8126.08s]  Maybe I'll...
[8126.08s -> 8127.12s]  I don't even know what that game was.
[8127.12s -> 8128.00s]  I forgot it already.
[8128.00s -> 8128.72s]  And I'm not going back.
[8129.44s -> 8132.70s]  This one's called Jerma Slappy.
[8132.70s -> 8134.06s]  I feel like I'm going to like this one.
[8137.05s -> 8137.85s]  Oh, you want to fight?
[8137.85s -> 8138.65s]  You want to fight?
[8138.65s -> 8139.53s]  Don't fuck with that.
[8139.53s -> 8140.01s]  I'm going in.
[8148.41s -> 8150.59s]  You want to fight?
[8150.59s -> 8151.39s]  You want to fight?
[8151.39s -> 8152.27s]  Don't fuck with that.
[8152.27s -> 8152.67s]  I'm going in.
[8160.64s -> 8161.12s]  That's good.
[8164.57s -> 8165.53s]  Riff the Pet.
[8166.33s -> 8166.97s]  Yeah.
[8166.97s -> 8168.73s]  I don't even know...
[8168.73s -> 8170.96s]  I'm not going to click Jerma Lick.
[8170.96s -> 8172.40s]  Yeah, I have no idea what that's going to do.
[8173.20s -> 8174.88s]  You don't click random YouTube videos.
[8174.88s -> 8175.68s]  You don't know what they are.
[8179.32s -> 8179.72s]  You have to...
[8179.72s -> 8180.36s]  No, I don't.
[8180.36s -> 8181.48s]  I don't know what it is.
[8181.48s -> 8182.52s]  No, I'm not going to click it.
[8185.42s -> 8186.06s]  High Risk.
[8187.26s -> 8188.54s]  High Risk, High Reward?
[8189.82s -> 8191.74s]  Explain to me what the reward is.
[8191.74s -> 8192.78s]  High Risk is...
[8193.82s -> 8195.82s]  Oh, yeah, that could be TOS.
[8195.82s -> 8196.70s]  Reward.
[8196.70s -> 8199.58s]  I get banned for three days
[8199.58s -> 8201.02s]  and have a strike on my account.
[8201.02s -> 8201.82s]  What's the reward?
[8202.38s -> 8203.10s]  It could be funny.
[8203.82s -> 8204.70s]  All right, let's go.
[8204.70s -> 8205.90s]  You want to hear a real vain.
[8206.46s -> 8213.15s]  I think we've seen this.
[8214.11s -> 8222.64s]  Have you never seen...
[8222.72s -> 8224.56s]  Have you ever seen Batman?
[8227.60s -> 8228.56s]  Fucking whatever.
[8233.76s -> 8235.68s]  You make darkness, is all I like.
[8236.32s -> 8237.84s]  But I was born it.
[8239.28s -> 8241.04s]  I drank up the darkness.
[8242.19s -> 8243.95s]  And you were just a baby.
[8243.95s -> 8244.99s]  What's that line?
[8244.99s -> 8245.79s]  I gotta look up the line.
[8245.79s -> 8246.19s]  Hold on.
[8247.82s -> 8248.78s]  Good Bane quote.
[8248.78s -> 8249.10s]  Hold on.
[8249.10s -> 8249.98s]  Good Bane...
[8249.98s -> 8250.94s]  Best Bane quote.
[8259.60s -> 8261.44s]  You make darkness, is all I like.
[8262.08s -> 8263.60s]  But I was born it.
[8265.02s -> 8266.86s]  I drank up the darkness.
[8267.95s -> 8269.71s]  And you were just a baby.
[8269.71s -> 8270.75s]  What's that line?
[8270.75s -> 8271.55s]  I gotta look up the line.
[8271.55s -> 8271.95s]  Hold on.
[8273.55s -> 8274.59s]  Good Bane quote.
[8274.59s -> 8274.83s]  Hold on.
[8274.83s -> 8275.71s]  Good Bane...
[8275.71s -> 8276.75s]  Best Bane quote.
[8279.63s -> 8281.23s]  That's like my favorite video now.
[8286.36s -> 8290.46s]  Derma Lick.
[8290.46s -> 8290.70s]  No!
[8291.34s -> 8295.23s]  What's that line?
[8295.23s -> 8295.95s]  Oh my god.
[8295.95s -> 8297.63s]  This is called Derma Mouse Has a...
[8298.19s -> 8300.43s]  Derma95 Mouse Has a Bad Hiccup.
[8301.23s -> 8302.35s]  I'm gonna blind you in a second.
[8307.66s -> 8308.16s]  Hi.
[8308.54s -> 8313.15s]  Hello.
[8313.15s -> 8313.65s]  You okay?
[8317.40s -> 8317.90s]  Yeah.
[8318.36s -> 8321.29s]  Are you sure?
[8322.97s -> 8327.44s]  Well, I have just never talked to a detective before.
[8328.72s -> 8330.72s]  I've heard so many nice things about you.
[8331.44s -> 8335.40s]  I don't want to be embarrassing.
[8344.80s -> 8345.92s]  That was cute.
[8345.92s -> 8346.88s]  What a cute one.
[8348.08s -> 8358.73s]  That was adorable.
[8359.85s -> 8363.80s]  This next one's called Derma Has Fallen into a River in Lego City.
[8364.92s -> 8369.63s]  A man has fallen...
[8369.63s -> 8370.83s]  Hold on. That hurt my head.
[8371.55s -> 8372.73s]  God damn it.
[8372.73s -> 8373.45s]  That fucking hurt.
[8373.45s -> 8374.57s]  That was so loud.
[8375.61s -> 8378.25s]  A man has fallen into the river in Lego City.
[8378.25s -> 8380.01s]  Start the new rescue helicopter.
[8381.37s -> 8381.87s]  Hey!
[8390.22s -> 8391.26s]  I better ban that guy.
[8391.26s -> 8394.46s]  Ban him. I don't want to see him ever fucking again in my chat.
[8394.46s -> 8395.10s]  Ever again!
[8402.19s -> 8405.44s]  Now at least I know where that thing is from now.
[8405.52s -> 8408.64s]  It's the first time I've ever seen the Lego City a man has fallen into the river.
[8410.25s -> 8410.57s]  I had...
[8410.57s -> 8412.89s]  You guys would write that shit all the time and I didn't even know what it was.
[8417.50s -> 8419.10s]  Please play Derma Lick.
[8419.10s -> 8421.50s]  All right. I'm gonna look up Derma Lick.
[8421.50s -> 8422.94s]  And I'm gonna see if it's appropriate for me.
[8423.50s -> 8424.30s]  Derma Lick.
[8424.30s -> 8425.02s]  Okay. Let's find out.
[8425.02s -> 8425.66s]  I'm muting this.
[8437.23s -> 8438.59s]  It's just kind of me going like...
[8438.59s -> 8439.15s]  All right. Fine.
[8439.15s -> 8439.65s]  It's...
[8440.19s -> 8440.59s]  Go it.
[8440.59s -> 8441.23s]  All right. It's fine.
[8441.79s -> 8442.43s]  Just me going like...
[8443.87s -> 8449.26s]  We watched it. Good.
[8451.61s -> 8460.09s]  All right. Come on up.
[8460.09s -> 8462.65s]  It's keep your hands off my stream.
[8463.61s -> 8466.57s]  This looks to be animated.
[8480.51s -> 8480.99s]  Go, Joe!
[8482.03s -> 8482.51s]  No, it's not.
[8483.47s -> 8484.03s]  This is good.
[8485.39s -> 8486.27s]  This is really good.
[8493.93s -> 8495.05s]  That's Joel and Vinnie?
[8495.05s -> 8497.48s]  That was really, really well done.
[8497.48s -> 8499.48s]  That was very well made.
[8499.48s -> 8501.48s]  That was awesome.
[8501.48s -> 8503.48s]  Here's a link to that one.
[8503.48s -> 8505.48s]  By the way, I noticed something about that video.
[8505.48s -> 8507.48s]  I'm sorry.
[8507.48s -> 8509.48s]  I'm sorry.
[8509.48s -> 8511.48s]  I'm sorry.
[8511.48s -> 8514.68s]  I'm sorry.
[8514.68s -> 8516.68s]  I'm sorry.
[8516.68s -> 8518.68s]  I'm sorry.
[8518.68s -> 8520.68s]  I'm sorry.
[8520.68s -> 8528.43s]  I'm sorry.
[8528.43s -> 8534.57s]  I'm sorry.
[8534.57s -> 8539.76s]  By the way, I noticed something about that video.
[8539.76s -> 8541.76s]  I'm like six inches tall than Joel is.
[8541.76s -> 8543.76s]  Pretty sick.
[8543.76s -> 8545.76s]  Pretty good, actually. That's pretty nice.
[8545.76s -> 8549.28s]  This one's called Jerma Wolf.
[8549.28s -> 8551.77s]  With this ruby, I replace your soul.
[8551.77s -> 8553.77s]  With this ruby, I replace your soul.
[8553.77s -> 8555.77s]  You will obey.
[8555.77s -> 8557.77s]  You will obey.
[8557.77s -> 8568.01s]  This ruby, I replace your soul.
[8568.01s -> 8570.01s]  This ruby, I replace your soul.
[8570.01s -> 8572.01s]  You will obey.
[8572.01s -> 8574.01s]  You will obey.
[8574.01s -> 8578.88s]  You hear the breathing, right?
[8578.88s -> 8580.88s]  You hear the breathing, right?
[8580.88s -> 8582.88s]  After that, that's like a, no, fuck.
[8582.88s -> 8593.48s]  After that, listen.
[8593.48s -> 8596.81s]  You can hear the exhausted, like, no.
[8596.81s -> 8600.33s]  That's good.
[8600.33s -> 8611.40s]  Coming up next, we have Jerma Has Lunch.
[8652.62s -> 8655.76s]  That was awesome.
[8655.76s -> 8657.76s]  That was just a true testament
[8657.76s -> 8659.76s]  that you can make anything.
[8659.76s -> 8661.76s]  You can.
[8661.76s -> 8663.76s]  As long as you've got creative juices flowing.
[8663.76s -> 8665.76s]  Look at this.
[8665.76s -> 8670.88s]  With the Discord edits.
[8670.88s -> 8674.72s]  That was great. Absolutely great.
[8674.72s -> 8680.22s]  This is Jerma Without Context.
[8680.22s -> 8682.22s]  The urinal rant.
[8682.22s -> 8684.22s]  I love Jerma Without Context stuff because
[8684.22s -> 8686.22s]  of course it's going to sound probably weird.
[8686.22s -> 8688.22s]  What do I say? That I like shit?
[8688.22s -> 8690.22s]  I like shit in the toilet and then piss on the shit
[8690.22s -> 8692.22s]  and then shit in the toilet again and then shitter.
[8692.22s -> 8694.22s]  How many times do I say shit, shit, right? I shit on the toilet.
[8694.22s -> 8696.22s]  Oh, that's, oh, that's disgusting.
[8696.22s -> 8698.22s]  Not if you piss right onto the drain.
[8698.22s -> 8700.22s]  Right?
[8700.22s -> 8702.22s]  Like, if you piss directly
[8702.22s -> 8704.22s]  onto the, right in the metal pocket.
[8704.22s -> 8707.80s]  What?
[8707.80s -> 8716.70s]  You could just stand in it.
[8716.70s -> 8719.45s]  Are they made like that?
[8719.45s -> 8721.63s]  Unless you stand through.
[8721.63s -> 8725.34s]  It'll splash back.
[8725.34s -> 8727.90s]  Here's the door.
[8727.90s -> 8729.90s]  P hits here.
[8729.90s -> 8731.90s]  Butter hits here.
[8731.90s -> 8733.90s]  And what does it do?
[8733.90s -> 8736.14s]  Flashes over you
[8736.14s -> 8738.14s]  and your shoes and
[8738.14s -> 8767.50s]  What are you doing?
[8767.50s -> 8769.50s]  No, that's not what I'm talking about.
[8769.50s -> 8771.50s]  That's like, I wouldn't put my penis into that.
[8771.50s -> 8785.07s]  I wouldn't put my penis
[8785.07s -> 8787.07s]  in like that Venus flytrap
[8787.07s -> 8789.63s]  looking thing.
[8789.63s -> 8805.23s]  What?
[8805.23s -> 8809.26s]  Oh, it's all over the place.
[8809.26s -> 8814.76s]  I wouldn't.
[8814.76s -> 8816.76s]  I wouldn't do that.
[8816.76s -> 8818.76s]  That was pretty good though.
[8818.76s -> 8822.54s]  Nice work. Excellent work.
[8822.54s -> 8825.61s]  Joel checks the bathroom.
[8825.61s -> 8833.16s]  You guys hearing something?
[8833.16s -> 8835.16s]  Shake the bathroom?
[8835.16s -> 8839.90s]  You guys
[8839.90s -> 8841.90s]  hearing something? Shake the bathroom?
[8841.90s -> 8849.95s]  That's pretty
[8849.95s -> 8851.95s]  quality.
[8851.95s -> 8856.11s]  What is
[8856.11s -> 8858.11s]  this bath video?
[8858.11s -> 8860.11s]  Only
[8860.11s -> 8862.11s]  true fans know, Danny.
[8862.11s -> 8870.86s]  You'll find it someday. Oh, here
[8870.86s -> 8872.86s]  it is. Here's the job interview one that
[8872.86s -> 8874.86s]  was almost auto-played.
[8874.86s -> 8877.10s]  Just imagine
[8877.10s -> 8879.10s]  I drank like fucking a pint of vodka.
[8879.10s -> 8884.65s]  I gotta
[8884.65s -> 8886.65s]  keep it like that though. That's so fucking
[8886.65s -> 8888.65s]  funny.
[8888.65s -> 8897.04s]  I see that they zipped up.
[8897.04s -> 8899.04s]  Wait, what happened?
[8899.04s -> 8901.21s]  Prepares for
[8901.21s -> 8903.21s]  a job
[8903.21s -> 8905.21s]  interview in a locked bathroom?
[8905.21s -> 8907.21s]  Just imagine I drank like fucking a pint of vodka.
[8907.21s -> 8909.21s]  Am I in a bathroom?
[8909.21s -> 8915.04s]  It's a mystery.
[8915.04s -> 8917.04s]  What the fuck?
[8917.04s -> 8919.04s]  I haven't, no, I haven't played Deus Ex.
[8919.04s -> 8922.75s]  I don't know what that is.
[8922.75s -> 8924.75s]  This next video could be titled
[8924.75s -> 8926.75s]  Proof that Jeremy Owns Others Shirts.
[8926.75s -> 8928.75s]  I'm gonna have to go get my rack
[8928.75s -> 8948.91s]  up close. Why?
[8948.91s -> 8950.91s]  What?
[8950.91s -> 8954.04s]  What?
[8954.04s -> 8956.86s]  Wait, that was so low. Hold on.
[8964.48s -> 8966.48s]  I thought it was a deep fake.
[8970.48s -> 8973.48s]  It does look like a
[8973.48s -> 8975.48s]  deep fake.
[8975.48s -> 8977.48s]  It does. It looks like a deep fake.
[8977.48s -> 8979.66s]  Yeah, like this is a deep fake video.
[8979.66s -> 8981.66s]  But I remember filming this.
[8981.66s -> 8989.40s]  What is this from? It's from like a Twitter
[8989.40s -> 8991.40s]  video. I said Happy New Year on Twitter
[8991.40s -> 8993.40s]  like three and a half years
[8993.40s -> 8997.12s]  ago. And wait, there's another
[8997.12s -> 8999.12s]  oh, this is the April, wait,
[8999.12s -> 9001.36s]  there's more noise videos?
[9001.36s -> 9003.36s]  Hey, April Fools.
[9003.36s -> 9005.98s]  It's a toilet,
[9005.98s -> 9008.35s]  you know what I mean?
[9008.35s -> 9026.52s]  Okay, so
[9026.52s -> 9028.52s]  for those of you that might not, you may not have been here
[9028.52s -> 9030.52s]  for a while.
[9030.52s -> 9032.52s]  Four years ago, three, I don't know, it was a long
[9032.52s -> 9034.52s]  time ago. I filmed this like, look at
[9034.52s -> 9036.52s]  me, I'm making a joke, April Fools video,
[9036.52s -> 9038.52s]  haha. Funny joke. Look,
[9038.52s -> 9040.52s]  April Fools toilet, haha, like I'm
[9040.52s -> 9042.52s]  making a joke, making a joke,
[9042.52s -> 9044.52s]  making a pretend joke video
[9044.52s -> 9046.76s]  for Twitter. And I dropped the phone
[9046.76s -> 9048.76s]  in the toilet for real. I was doing
[9048.76s -> 9050.76s]  this thing that, oh, like I pretend to hit my head on the
[9050.76s -> 9052.76s]  door. And I dropped the phone and it went
[9052.76s -> 9057.88s]  right into the toilet for real. It was
[9057.88s -> 9059.88s]  not good.
[9059.88s -> 9065.26s]  Coming up next is Jerma's Funniest
[9065.26s -> 9072.30s]  Home Videos.
[9105.34s -> 9107.34s]  Oh, shit!
[9107.34s -> 9116.75s]  What's his degree in?
[9116.75s -> 9118.75s]  Physical comedy?
[9124.57s -> 9127.07s]  Some performers drop a mic.
[9127.07s -> 9129.07s]  Don't fuck, don't fuck, come back.
[9129.07s -> 9131.07s]  Do this.
[9131.07s -> 9140.03s]  God damn it, that was fucking
[9140.03s -> 9142.03s]  perfect. Who wins?
[9142.03s -> 9144.03s]  Who wins?
[9144.03s -> 9146.46s]  Who wins?
[9146.46s -> 9150.56s]  God damn it,
[9150.56s -> 9152.56s]  that's so good. Here's
[9152.56s -> 9155.24s]  the link.
[9155.24s -> 9157.24s]  Some performers are good at deadlifting.
[9163.48s -> 9168.54s]  Coming up next is
[9168.54s -> 9170.54s]  The Witch's Curse Part 1.
[9170.54s -> 9172.54s]  You will see a familiar style
[9172.54s -> 9180.54s]  to this one. Humble Buck
[9180.54s -> 9182.54s]  Incorporated Pictures presents
[9182.54s -> 9186.83s]  The Witch's Curse.
[9186.83s -> 9193.36s]  Starring
[9193.36s -> 9196.49s]  Bass Jerma and
[9196.49s -> 9198.86s]  Purple Alien. The saga
[9198.86s -> 9224.01s]  continues. Wait, why
[9224.01s -> 9226.01s]  is it still driving?
[9226.01s -> 9263.45s]  I'm so immersed.
[9263.45s -> 9280.52s]  I wonder what that means.
[9280.52s -> 9283.53s]  Oh no, we've been shrunken.
[9283.53s -> 9297.85s]  What?

[12463.24s -> 12467.56s]  Well, in the meantime, I applied for a semester abroad at a music university in australia and I got accepted
[12468.04s -> 12470.43s]  With a super pug today
[12470.43s -> 12475.15s]  I woke up to an email from them saying that international students had their applications withdrawn because of the corona virus
[12476.09s -> 12479.93s]  Thanks for being there and cheering us up with your streams during these fucked up times
[12485.39s -> 12487.39s]  Yeah, I i've heard
[12488.27s -> 12490.83s]  I have no idea what's gonna happen with school and stuff
[12492.86s -> 12497.50s]  Because a lot of places are still canceling school through the end of the year what happens to the students
[12498.54s -> 12504.54s]  Is everybody just kind of held back a year. Do you do it again? What do you do with that the group of students?
[12505.10s -> 12506.46s]  Do it online

[12537.74s -> 12539.34s]  Lab work and
[12539.34s -> 12541.96s]  It's gonna be a really really strange time

[12558.59s -> 12564.80s]  They reach back out and you can get that done and you can go travel and go do things and study abroad

[13939.95s -> 13944.83s]  It's hard to stay motivated in the same place where I normally would relax and work on personal projects
[13945.39s -> 13948.83s]  Motivation is motivation is a bitch. We're just all trying our best
[13949.47s -> 13952.35s]  Thanks for the entertainment while this whack-ass shit plays out
[13955.15s -> 13956.51s]  Yeah
[13956.51s -> 13958.51s]  No, that makes it makes total sense
[13959.81s -> 13962.69s]  Separating your work and your play
[13963.81s -> 13965.89s]  It's actually a really good idea
[13965.89s -> 13969.41s]  And if you can't then you sort of kind of mix them together and it's it's
[13969.97s -> 13976.13s]  Doesn't work out so well for a lot of people. I'm one of them. I know we make you use that term office
[13977.17s -> 13982.53s]  But if if I didn't have my computer and my monitors and my desk in a different room
[13984.26s -> 13986.34s]  I'm not I would I think it would be kind of fucked up
[13987.06s -> 13991.71s]  Like it has to be like this. I have to have it in here. It has to be like in a separate area
[13993.54s -> 13995.22s]  So I can imagine
[13995.22s -> 13998.13s]  Especially something like schoolwork. Well, you need that environment
[13998.69s -> 14006.50s]  But yeah, hopefully it is over soon
[14008.58s -> 14010.58s]  Everybody wants this in the rearview mirror
[14011.18s -> 14012.14s]  so
[14012.14s -> 14014.74s]  People can try to go back to normal
[14014.74s -> 14017.78s]  Just a question of when how and logistically how does that work?
[14018.50s -> 14021.31s]  Hopefully over the coming months we can figure that out
[14021.71s -> 14030.08s]  Thanks for the three bucks. Thank you

[14051.31s -> 14054.90s]  Hopefully somebody gave you bits for your birthday
[14055.14s -> 14068.85s]  Did you did you have a birthday party and have have did somebody send you bits send them back send the bits back?
[14069.65s -> 14071.65s]  I don't have the capability to do that
[14071.81s -> 14075.58s]  What does it say? What does it say? All refunds are?
[14076.46s -> 14087.02s]  Um final or whatever it was what's the thing I got it right all sales are final. Happy birthday though emily

[14129.60s -> 14139.31s]  There's not something else
[14141.47s -> 14149.42s]  Okay, I guess that is what it is, um, this is the video um spoilers for the sopranos maybe I don't know

[14192.62s -> 14195.26s]  And I might have to take my first semester of art college online

[14309.50s -> 14310.38s]  or
[14310.38s -> 14315.50s]  Directly in the discord can work but it's easier for me if it's on like an actual website
