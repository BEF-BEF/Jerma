[3.13s -> 18.73s]  On a fucking iPhone. Am I even live right now? I might be on my shitty iPhone. I can see the chat too, that's good.
[18.73s -> 26.54s]  I'm like right up in your face tonight. Where's the camera? Right here? Right there, okay.
[26.54s -> 32.41s]  Well, you're... Well, no, no, I can't, I can't talk yet. I need to wait till everybody's here.
[32.41s -> 42.74s]  This is gonna be like a 15 minute stream because data! Ooh, I'm gonna be spending money on data!
[42.74s -> 46.90s]  This is where, I don't like this. I don't like this setup. I can like see myself
[47.22s -> 53.80s]  and I get the chat. I'm like, I'm... Can you hear me? Can you guys even hear what I'm saying?
[53.80s -> 61.38s]  How shitty is this quality? Is this, is this like 2G? You can hear me? Okay, good.
[61.38s -> 67.16s]  Finally, I'm at least able to stream on my dog shit device. Is it like 240p? It's probably
[67.16s -> 81.46s]  worse than that. It's probably like 60p. Makes me look really old. Whatever. But I can't...
[81.46s -> 90.06s]  Where are my stats? Oh, there we go. I can see my stats. I can see you guys now. So we
[90.06s -> 96.66s]  still don't have internet. Our house is currently in a total... We got nothing.
[98.55s -> 105.19s]  We've got another line that's come on in and still doesn't work.
[105.19s -> 110.44s]  So now, there's a whole other scenario here where they have to do a lot of work.
[110.44s -> 116.44s]  This is why I'm coming to you from the phone. And that kind of segues into the next topic
[116.44s -> 124.10s]  here, which is because I don't know when I'm going to be able to stream from this office.
[124.10s -> 129.56s]  From... Let me get you guys on where you're used to, right? Hold on, here we go.
[129.56s -> 134.97s]  See? It's like nothing ever... It's like there's no difference. See? You can see my office in the
[134.97s -> 142.58s]  door like last time. But yes, it's an office. It's a goddamn office. Because it's not my
[142.58s -> 148.98s]  bedroom. It's another room that's used for the purposes of streaming. But... No, this is
[148.98s -> 154.34s]  going to hurt my arm. We're going to do this. That hurts my hand. That hurts my fingers.
[154.34s -> 159.91s]  There we go. So I don't know. I have no idea when we're actually going to be able to
[159.91s -> 165.80s]  reliably stream from this place. So what that means is that means I've decided to do something
[165.80s -> 171.94s]  that we've been talking about for a long time. And that is the green screen stream. Remember that?
[171.94s -> 174.49s]  Remember I was going to get in front of a green screen? I was going to go to a green
[174.49s -> 179.80s]  screen studio and do all that shit? Well, that's now happening much sooner than you think.
[179.80s -> 186.84s]  So let me break down how this is going to play out as you count the fucking neck rolls.
[186.84s -> 200.76s]  How many neck rolls do I have now? When did that happen? What the fuck? When did I get
[200.76s -> 206.23s]  like a turkey neck? Like a turtle? Whatever. You know, nobody even cares. You're not even
[206.23s -> 211.94s]  going to look at it. Well, now you are because I just said it. Anyways, so the purpose of this
[211.94s -> 218.82s]  stream is to kind of pad the time still to be able to actually live stream. So what's going
[218.82s -> 225.34s]  to happen is I'm going to say it and it's good. I gave the mod some warning here,
[225.34s -> 233.00s]  but the Discord is going to open up here with a new channel. And on that new channel
[233.00s -> 239.30s]  is going to be stalling. Well, I can't stall. I'm on like G right now. I'm going
[239.38s -> 243.38s]  to get a call from my provider and they're going to be like, oh yes, you use like 16
[243.38s -> 248.74s]  minutes of 240p data. That'll be $400. I'm going to be like.
[252.95s -> 258.30s]  So in the Discord, there's going to be a new channel. It's going to be action recommendations
[258.30s -> 263.40s]  because what we talked about before, a long time ago, months ago, when I first wanted to
[263.40s -> 268.82s]  do this idea, I'm going to get in front of a green screen in a professional studio,
[268.82s -> 271.70s]  not just like, oh, I'm going to put a green screen behind me. No, I'm going to, it's going
[271.78s -> 277.18s]  to be like a 50 foot space and I'm going to be able to do anything. We're talking,
[277.18s -> 281.91s]  I'm not going to give you any ideas. What you guys are going to have to do is come
[281.91s -> 286.76s]  up with about 30 of them, 30 actions that you want me to do. It's going to be a
[286.76s -> 293.24s]  nomination process. The mods are already aware and I'm not going to see what they are.
[293.24s -> 299.88s]  So you have, depending on how long it takes for us to get the internet fixed,
[299.96s -> 307.66s]  I'm going to try to do this within the next three or four days. So that gives you at least
[307.66s -> 314.22s]  a couple of days to nominate some actions, which by the way, I get three vetoes. So
[315.42s -> 321.22s]  just remember that I get to veto at least three of these things that you want me to do
[321.22s -> 326.50s]  out of like 30. So you better get good ones because I'm going to have a big rubber stamp
[326.50s -> 331.82s]  that's going to be like, bang, I ain't doing that. But that's going to happen
[331.82s -> 337.13s]  starting tonight and into tomorrow and the next day. And then I'm going to that studio
[337.13s -> 343.72s]  and I'm going to broadcast from the studio. So that's the plan. Now, before we continue,
[343.72s -> 353.19s]  why are we at 280p? Because I'm on an iPhone on like shit internet. I'm on an iPhone right
[353.19s -> 362.06s]  now. There's no internet in this. I don't have any internet. It just doesn't work.
[362.06s -> 368.49s]  I'm turning red. You said the word internet. No, I did. I said the word internet and I
[368.49s -> 377.40s]  just got red. Anyways, so I'm going to get to veto three of them, but let's go over rules.
[377.40s -> 382.73s]  Let's go over a couple of important things because I know how deeply this could go
[382.73s -> 390.06s]  totally south. What do I mean by that? All the mods have, they're going to delete
[390.06s -> 397.56s]  submissions that are sexual. No sexual bullshit. I'm not going to do anything in front of a
[397.56s -> 403.88s]  green screen. What you can do is, you know, I'm not going to happen. So use common sense
[403.88s -> 408.07s]  with what you'd like me to do in front of a green screen because they're going to get
[408.07s -> 419.80s]  picked out. Oh, am I dropping? Am I dropping frames on my iPhone screen? I just was for a
[419.80s -> 427.62s]  second. But yeah, so just use common sense. Like I ain't going to do anything like
[427.62s -> 431.22s]  fucked up in front of that green screen for you to then like, oh, let me like, dude,
[431.22s -> 436.25s]  let me put him here. Look what he just did. I mean, that's, that's the purpose of the whole
[436.25s -> 442.81s]  thing. I mean, but I'm talking like in, in like a bad sense, right? Cause what's going to happen
[442.81s -> 448.57s]  after that is after three or four days, I'm going to do the stream. We're going to do all
[448.57s -> 456.39s]  the actions and then I'm going to put on a host site or I might not even have to,
[456.39s -> 461.80s]  we'll see how the quality is. The footage, right? If you guys don't want to pull it from
[461.88s -> 466.95s]  the stream itself, then I'm going to put up probably raw footage somewhere. And then
[468.07s -> 476.01s]  it's you guys get to make whatever you want as long as it is okay. You know what I'm saying?
[476.01s -> 480.42s]  And we're going to have a community event a couple of weeks later where we watch them all
[480.42s -> 484.39s]  on stream. All of them are going to get processed. Mods are going to watch them to
[484.39s -> 489.90s]  make sure. Like I said, no, nothing's going to slip through the cracks here. So we're going
[489.90s -> 494.97s]  to watch it. No, it doesn't, it doesn't need to be like PG 13. You can do some R rated
[494.97s -> 499.53s]  material like, you know, but nothing no like bullshit. Do you know what I mean? And you know
[499.53s -> 503.53s]  exactly what I'm talking about. When I say that I don't even do it. I don't need to explain
[503.53s -> 514.92s]  what that means. No bullshit. Okay. Use your goddamn common sense. Yes. People, you guys
[514.92s -> 518.95s]  get it. You guys get it. But anyways, we're going to do a big community event where we watch
[518.95s -> 523.43s]  them and we watch what you guys have decided to do with the green screen footage. There's
[523.43s -> 529.03s]  going to be like probably like an hour of green screen material. I look forward to what
[529.03s -> 533.59s]  you guys do. Eye contact stream. Well, it's cause like it's right here. Would you rather
[533.59s -> 541.14s]  me look over at the chat? Cause that's what I could do too. Free material. No, I mean,
[541.14s -> 546.42s]  well, look, look, look when the reason why this is an interesting idea is because
[547.37s -> 551.77s]  all the shit that you guys were doing with the bee stuff, like the wasp snapping and
[551.77s -> 557.05s]  everything. There's some creative fucking people in this community. And I'd like to
[557.05s -> 562.54s]  see it actually flourish, you know, not just like, Oh, there's me and I'll put a bee here.
[562.54s -> 566.06s]  I think that's really interesting to see what people will come up with.
[566.06s -> 571.45s]  And we're going to do a whole event. We're going to watch them all. So again, the discord is
[571.45s -> 575.88s]  going to open up with the new channel. All the suggestions go there. I'm not going to read them.
[575.88s -> 579.88s]  I'm not going to see them. I will not know what they are until I get the piece of paper
[580.44s -> 585.46s]  at the studio that I go to. And again, I get my big stamp that I'm going to stamp
[585.46s -> 590.44s]  out ones that I don't want to do three of them. So I wish I could give you an example
[590.44s -> 598.01s]  here. But if there is a certain, by the way, let's make this rule very, very clear as
[598.01s -> 604.57s]  well. If the, if there are no doubles, there are no doubles are going to be allowed here.
[604.57s -> 612.01s]  So if you put down, let's say, I don't know, like six or seven different dances,
[613.70s -> 618.98s]  I don't know. And they're all the same, like, no, no, no, no, no, no. You know doubles,
[618.98s -> 626.94s]  they got to be all unique or I'll fucking veto them. I'm just going to veto them all.
[626.94s -> 633.19s]  You want to see, you want to see this motherfucker do a dance, you bet your ass,
[633.19s -> 640.10s]  you better come to a consensus on it. Because I'll veto that shit. I'm already not looking
[640.10s -> 644.95s]  forward to it. And I already know what and I already just gave you the idea. I ain't doing
[644.95s -> 647.99s]  it. Just already know that that's that's good. That's that's going to get vetoed.
[647.99s -> 653.14s]  That's like an automatic veto. But I have some you buddy, you better have some better shit
[653.14s -> 664.89s]  on there because I get three vetoes. Do a default dance, default. Well, what is it? What
[664.89s -> 673.53s]  even is a default dance? So no stream tonight? Well, no, unless you count this,
[673.53s -> 676.58s]  which I wouldn't because it's just a quick little thing. I just wanted to make sure that
[676.58s -> 683.45s]  I got people aware of what's happening and told people the, you know, what's going on
[683.45s -> 688.78s]  because you guys have waited at least three weeks, two or three weeks or so for
[688.78s -> 694.10s]  me to come back and it's like, hey, I'm back. No, I'm not just just just kidding.
[694.10s -> 697.61s]  So I want to do something fun while the internet's up because I don't have to use
[697.61s -> 702.31s]  I'm not going to be using my internet. I'll be in the studio. We streaming from there.
[702.31s -> 709.51s]  So in the next two days or so, try to come to a consensus over the next 48 hours of what
[709.51s -> 712.97s]  you'd want me to do for actions somewhere around with them. I've already talked to the
[712.97s -> 719.72s]  mods about it. So somewhere around like 25 to 30 ish dances. I mean, not dances. No,
[719.72s -> 728.02s]  I mean, 25 to 30 actions, 25 to 30 actions is going to put every single fortnight dance,
[728.02s -> 732.55s]  but that's not going to happen because that's two step. That would be counting as a double.
[732.55s -> 735.75s]  If there's a fortnight dance on there, it's getting vetoed. I'm just, fuck it. Let's
[735.75s -> 741.75s]  just say it. And if you put it, if you put like 20 fortnight dances on it, it doesn't
[742.07s -> 746.33s]  double. So that doesn't count. You're not going to be able to do that. So it's just
[746.33s -> 750.50s]  getting fucking vetoed. You know what? Let's just go with this. Don't even put fortnight
[750.50s -> 753.78s]  on the list because I'm not doing it. Don't even do it. Pick something else. Do something
[753.78s -> 760.57s]  better. It is double. It's the same area. It's the same spot. It's the same company
[760.57s -> 769.22s]  that made the game and the same animating studio created it. I didn't want to say
[769.22s -> 779.86s]  it, but I had to. Now this is not epic, but yeah. So that'll be in the next few days.
[779.86s -> 784.42s]  Come to a consensus on what you want me to do. And by the way, if you do mention props,
[784.42s -> 788.86s]  right? I'll give you an example of one that I would definitely wouldn't veto at all.
[788.86s -> 793.34s]  Absolutely not. That German getting lost kayaking, right? Like, I mean, that's,
[793.34s -> 796.78s]  that's a fairly non vetoable fun thing that I could do in front of a green
[796.78s -> 800.14s]  screen with the whole kayak there and be like, oh, rapids, right? I mean,
[800.14s -> 804.46s]  that's a pretty good idea. If there are props involved, I'm going to need to know,
[804.46s -> 809.85s]  right? Like I'm going to need to know what props. So if you do want to include
[809.85s -> 812.65s]  props, it's got to be something that I can obtain. That's not going to cost a
[812.65s -> 819.06s]  shitload of money because it is that I'm going to have to improvise. Are they
[819.06s -> 829.83s]  going to what? This chat is too small. I don't like being that close. Do a
[829.83s -> 842.79s]  little action clown. I that would be tough. You'll see what you come up with
[842.79s -> 846.39s]  for the most part, though, try to keep it something I can do on my own.
[846.39s -> 849.66s]  And if there's going to be a shitload of props, maybe the mods can get
[849.66s -> 852.54s]  involved there and make it so I don't have to buy like a bunch of fucking
[852.54s -> 856.01s]  weird shit on like Amazon, you know, I still, and that's like,
[856.01s -> 858.33s]  even if I get two days shipping, it's going to take me a couple of days to get
[858.33s -> 866.01s]  some of those props, but you'll see. We'll get it going. Any questions?
[866.01s -> 870.90s]  People are subscribing and giving money and shit and I can't even keep up with
[870.90s -> 876.07s]  it. I'm so sorry. Thank you, everybody that came in here. You got questions.
[876.07s -> 882.97s]  Okay. How you doing? I'm doing pretty good. That's pretty good question.
[882.97s -> 889.91s]  No questions. What's your favorite Fortnite dance? What's probably this
[889.91s -> 896.98s]  one? I think it's definitely this one, but the kid goes like, right,
[896.98s -> 904.46s]  but like the backpack kid, something like that. Should I just did a, I
[904.46s -> 922.23s]  just did a Fortnite dance. I like, you like my ladder? That's because I can
[922.23s -> 925.66s]  reach up there. You know what I'm saying? It's hard to put those up there.
[925.66s -> 933.38s]  Well, you're not that, uh, I mean look at how strong I am though.
[933.38s -> 939.50s]  Come on. Give me a break. Give me a break. These ceilings are like 15
[939.50s -> 942.54s]  fucking feet tall. Even if you were 6'2", you wouldn't be able to get up
[942.54s -> 947.26s]  there. It's like, this ceiling's a fucking
[947.26s -> 959.61s]  30 feet tall. Ah, all right. Any, any real questions?
[959.61s -> 962.01s]  I'm trying to think about if I didn't, if I missed anything. All right,
[962.09s -> 965.77s]  let's go, let's break it down one more time real quickly.
[965.77s -> 970.01s]  No internet still. It's getting resolved. It will be resolved
[970.01s -> 974.01s]  soon. Hopefully. I have no ETA. Because of that,
[974.01s -> 977.91s]  iPhone stream. Internet phone stream. iPhone stream. That's why I'm here
[977.91s -> 981.43s]  doing this. iPhone stream. Uh, uh, because of
[981.43s -> 985.35s]  that, streaming from a studio in probably three or four days.
[985.35s -> 988.79s]  Studio stream. Green screen stream. Go to the discord. Get your
[988.79s -> 991.75s]  nominations in. Find out what you want me to do. 30 actions.
[991.75s -> 995.19s]  No bullshit. No dumb shit. I mean, well, no bullshit.
[995.19s -> 998.81s]  You, you. That guy right there that said that exactly what you want me to do
[998.81s -> 1001.13s]  right there. I'm not going to do it. Make sure you get that figured out.
[1001.13s -> 1005.46s]  No bullshit. Come to a consensus. No doubles.
[1005.46s -> 1017.50s]  And that's it. Are you actually, am I a house tour?
[1017.50s -> 1021.14s]  No, I don't want you to know what's in my house.
[1021.14s -> 1030.63s]  Here, I'll give you a tour. Let's just show you this, by the way.
[1030.63s -> 1036.18s]  You see how, do you see this? Do you think you can reach up there?
[1036.18s -> 1041.43s]  This is, this is a five-foot ladder. So right now,
[1041.43s -> 1049.16s]  right now, I am like 15 feet tall. You see? Like, I'm, I'm, the ceiling is
[1049.16s -> 1052.76s]  still here. And look at this. My arm is like a good two feet.
[1052.76s -> 1058.20s]  I'm 5'8". This is five feet. This is like a 12-foot ceiling. You think you,
[1058.20s -> 1062.28s]  you think you're so funny? Oh fuck! He's gonna fall!
[1062.28s -> 1067.93s]  Oh! That wasn't, look, there's not much I can do with a
[1067.93s -> 1073.16s]  phone in my hand. I, like, I, I, I'm, I'm, I'm...
[1073.16s -> 1083.26s]  All right. I'm glad we had this conversation. I'm not touring the house.
[1083.26s -> 1086.74s]  There could be like shit over there that I don't want you to see. Like,
[1086.74s -> 1090.50s]  I don't know. I don't like house tours. I don't, like, I don't know why people
[1090.50s -> 1094.82s]  do that. Okay, let's go ahead. Over here.
[1094.82s -> 1098.58s]  Hey, that's where I sleep every night. That's right in that bed.
[1098.58s -> 1102.02s]  Oh, there's like underwear on the ground. Let me just move that out of the way.
[1102.02s -> 1105.38s]  What's this? I just like, this is like my dirty underwear.
[1105.38s -> 1108.20s]  Whoops, sorry. Oh, there's, by the way, there's my, oh,
[1108.20s -> 1111.16s]  let's go to the garage. There's my car. Oh, cool!
[1111.16s -> 1115.90s]  Hey, that's my fucking plates. No, no, you don't,
[1115.90s -> 1121.62s]  I don't want anyone to know where I sleep. Because then you'll know, like,
[1121.62s -> 1124.41s]  where the bed is. You know, you'll know what, like,
[1124.41s -> 1126.89s]  the window is. You'll know where the bed is.
[1126.89s -> 1131.61s]  Oh, it takes us some guy, like, oh, I'm gonna case that house. Where,
[1131.61s -> 1135.85s]  where, where's all the valuable shit? Oh, this is where I keep my safe of
[1135.93s -> 1139.29s]  money. You know, it's just right there. By the way, there's the window, or if
[1139.29s -> 1171.05s]  you're curious. I gotta get out there and fix that.
[1171.05s -> 1175.99s]  He's gonna fall. I'm not gonna fall. If I fell,
[1175.99s -> 1179.51s]  it's not like, what, I'm gonna fall like fucking five
[1179.51s -> 1191.03s]  feet. What happened to the other one? It's because I was screaming. That's
[1191.03s -> 1200.65s]  good. Good? I don't think that's good.
[1200.65s -> 1204.63s]  This is just barely hanging on now. What, what, what did you do?
[1204.63s -> 1214.38s]  What did you do? This took so long to do.
[1214.38s -> 1221.70s]  This took so fucking long to do. I gotta fix it later.
[1221.70s -> 1224.82s]  The whole thing is, the fucking whole thing.
[1224.82s -> 1234.62s]  Whatever. What the fuck. Oh, now I know how loud I can get in this. What
[1234.62s -> 1241.06s]  happened? Oh, that one fell too. Well, now I
[1241.06s -> 1242.90s]  know how loud I can get in this room before
[1242.90s -> 1248.38s]  stuff starts to fall off the fucking ceiling. Bad acoustics?
[1248.38s -> 1253.24s]  No, they are, they are fucked up. You're right.
[1253.24s -> 1259.94s]  You're actually right. Where's Otto? He's, he's
[1259.94s -> 1263.30s]  hanging out with Kim right now. He's like sleeping and I'm not going to wake
[1263.30s -> 1265.70s]  him up. There's bugs on the wall. Those are not,
[1265.70s -> 1270.90s]  all right, fine, fine. Those are fucking caterpillars.
[1270.90s -> 1280.33s]  Bugs on the wall. There's just like black slugs coming in. Oh yeah, those
[1280.33s -> 1284.30s]  are, those are slugs. They're everywhere in this place.
[1284.30s -> 1293.26s]  You want me to eat one? Want me to eat one of those caterpillars on stream?
[1293.26s -> 1296.31s]  All right, I'm gonna run out of data. I gotta get out of here. I'm
[1296.31s -> 1300.23s]  gonna get a fucking call from Verizon. They're gonna be like, oh, excuse me.
[1300.23s -> 1302.23s]  Do you wish that you could have our service?
[1302.23s -> 1305.91s]  Verizon Fios, the best fucking service ever, like
[1305.91s -> 1312.89s]  absolute number one internet ever. Don't you wish you could get that?
[1312.89s -> 1317.00s]  You guys know, I'll shill it every day. I swear to God.
[1317.00s -> 1327.86s]  You know that's $39 a month for a 100-100 Verizon Fios connection?
[1327.86s -> 1332.50s]  Why won't you just expand? We, please, I want that internet.
[1332.50s -> 1338.79s]  Give it to me. I'll pay quadruple. I'll pay septuple for that internet.
[1338.79s -> 1347.58s]  Most reliable network in the fucking world. That's time, it's time to move
[1347.58s -> 1353.38s]  again. All right, time to move back to Boston.
[1353.38s -> 1360.57s]  They got Fios there. Desperate streamer sells out for
[1360.57s -> 1366.39s]  internet. No, it's gonna be fine. From the
[1366.39s -> 1369.51s]  understanding that we've had, it's not like, oh, the internet just
[1369.51s -> 1374.86s]  sucks here. No, it is just a, there's just a problem that needs to be solved
[1374.86s -> 1379.37s]  and then we're gonna have lightning-fast speeds from, I'm not gonna even say
[1379.37s -> 1381.93s]  their name, because I wanted to work first, you know
[1381.93s -> 1386.94s]  what I'm saying? I already did. I already did, you're right.
[1386.94s -> 1396.95s]  Never mind. Lightning-fast. Show the ladder before I leave.
[1396.95s -> 1408.65s]  Why? I don't get it. Why do you want to see the ladder? I don't get it.
[1408.65s -> 1418.68s]  But what? Prove the height of the ladder. Oh, it's staring fucking down.
