[1.40s -> 19.72s]  Hi, welcome back to another day, another stream. Today, as you know, we're gonna be playing Tiny
[19.72s -> 29.29s]  Toons Wacky Sports, one of my favorite Super Nintendo games. I probably have as many hours
[29.29s -> 36.47s]  in Tiny Toons Wacky Sports for the course of my life as I do in Team Fortress. We're talking
[36.47s -> 49.91s]  thousands of hours from the ages of like 13 to 17. This is like one of the only games I own
[49.99s -> 58.60s]  for the Super Nintendo, owned when I was younger. Oh no, he referenced it again.
[60.68s -> 72.97s]  Tiny. Oh, funny. What about the Mickey game? Yeah, the Mickey game's good too. I'm sorry,
[72.97s -> 81.70s]  excuse me. The magical quest starring Mickey Mouse. He's just in that game. It's the magical quest
[82.42s -> 90.63s]  starring Mickey Mouse. He better be so fucking good at this game. Oh, I'm gonna be real good
[90.63s -> 98.12s]  at this game because it's about hitting a button as fast as you can. And we all know I've come
[98.12s -> 108.41s]  close to that record. And when I beat that guy live on stream, that guy was like number 10 in
[108.41s -> 121.19s]  the world. I became number nine. Is this where it all began? No, maybe not. Here's some personal
[121.19s -> 128.18s]  lore for you guys. Friends of mine used to hand me the controller when you needed to press a button
[128.18s -> 134.97s]  really fast. In Metal Gear Solid 1, there's a point in the game where you have to press the
[134.97s -> 142.71s]  button as fast as possible. And it is insanely difficult. And in fact, I mean, spoilers,
[142.71s -> 149.53s]  you have to press a button real fast. That could mean anything. But I used to get handed the
[149.53s -> 155.19s]  controller. Dude, I need you to do this. And I'd be like, hold on, don't worry, I got this. And I
[155.19s -> 163.90s]  crack my knuckles and just go. And then I would give it back. Because I'm a one trick pony.
[164.46s -> 170.84s]  I don't have any I don't have any other tricks. I have one if I was like a MOBA character,
[170.84s -> 178.38s]  I'd have one move. It would be unload entire clip in three seconds. And it would just do like 6000
[178.38s -> 181.66s]  damage. And then it would be like a two hour cooldown. You'd only be able to use it once a
[181.66s -> 194.89s]  game. That's just tracer. I wouldn't even have an auto attack. Oh, you just have to I just have to
[194.89s -> 200.41s]  walk around. And that one team fight that is really, really important. Just get me in there
[200.41s -> 204.30s]  and give me the controller and I'll just spam that button. But then I need like a fucking two
[204.30s -> 212.23s]  hour break, dude. I'm going to bed. I can't walk. That's a second move. What movement is not a move.
[216.79s -> 223.02s]  Anyways, let's play. This is a game about it's a mini game game. And say this is going to be a
[223.02s -> 229.35s]  long stream. I'm going to adhere to what we're supposed to be doing. Not eight hour streams
[229.35s -> 239.85s]  like last night. Play this for a little while. See what happens. This game fucking sucks. You
[239.85s -> 249.46s]  can't just use that when you want to. You can't just say this game sucks. All right, here we go.
[250.42s -> 255.46s]  I'm looking forward to this. Hopefully I have my button spam capabilities ready because you have
[255.46s -> 262.95s]  there are so many cases where you have to spam the button. I'm probably going to get exhausted
[262.95s -> 271.13s]  in the first 40 minutes. I'm not going to lie to you. Here we go. Is everybody ready? Oh,
[271.13s -> 292.57s]  I hear the music. Oh my God. We're tiny. We're toony. We're all a little loony. And in this
[292.57s -> 298.09s]  cartoony, we're invading your TV. We've got all the questions, the questions and expectations
[298.09s -> 304.33s]  and tiny tune adventures. It's invading your TV. So here at me acres, we're enjoying your TV.
[304.33s -> 311.13s]  We've been learning farts since 1933. Expect the unexpected. Expect the unexpected. It's tiny
[311.13s -> 326.95s]  tune adventures. Please enjoy the fun. And now let's keep going. You guys ready? God damn it.
[328.07s -> 338.42s]  We're tiny. We're toony. I'm not going to fucking do that. Ladies and gentlemen, Montana Max's
[338.42s -> 343.22s]  sports festival opens grand prize of $1 million. I told you, remember I said Montana Max.
[349.77s -> 361.42s]  I'm gonna prove that I'm the best athlete in Acme Acres. I'm going to build my own
[361.42s -> 373.10s]  theater with this prize money with $1 million. I can become a presidential candidate.
[374.06s -> 388.31s]  What? I can party every day with lots of food. All right. I gotta be Flucky. Flucky's my guy.
[389.19s -> 404.14s]  That's just a million dollars. No, that's not Taz. That's Dizzy Devil. These are all their kids.
[407.00s -> 413.50s]  Buster. These are all their children. Flucky Duck. This is Daffy Duck's son. Dizzy Devil. This is
[413.50s -> 424.15s]  Tasmanian Devil's son. Babs Bunny. No, they're not. They were supposed to be the new generation
[424.15s -> 429.03s]  of... Here's what happened. Let me explain. Looney Tunes came out and then they said, fuck,
[429.03s -> 435.19s]  we need a new generation of cartoon Looney Tunes. It's been like 75 years. Let's have like young...
[435.19s -> 439.43s]  Oh, here's like the new generation. Flucky Duck instead of Daffy Duck. Dizzy Devil.
[440.31s -> 444.23s]  And then they did it again, which you don't know in the last probably five years with the Teen
[444.23s -> 448.87s]  Titans. Teen Titans are now the Looney Tunes of the current generation.
[451.03s -> 469.67s]  That's Robin is Flucky Duck's son. That is Mike. The games are about to begin. Let's go. I'm ready
[469.67s -> 476.97s]  to spam. I'm ready to fucking spam. The first event is Ice Cream Throw at Wacky Land. Wait,
[476.97s -> 487.13s]  this is not a spam one. Instant loss. Throw the ice cream at the targets as they come out. If you hit
[487.13s -> 498.36s]  them in a row without missing, you'll get the big points. Okay. Throw, throw ice cream, move.
[498.36s -> 505.56s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm ready. I got to get 250 points to qualify. I'm ready. And then it goes...
[510.12s -> 514.68s]  The best song. Where's the OST for this shit? Not this one. I mean,
[515.80s -> 523.64s]  how many of the X's? I just have to beat these fucking losers. That's all that matters. See,
[523.64s -> 542.60s]  what an idiot. Hit all the irons. 20 points. No! Sorry. That's why I screamed.
[545.02s -> 547.50s]  Oh my god. Okay, this is fucking hard. I forgot how hard this was.
[548.78s -> 563.06s]  I need 250, right? All right. I smoked them all. I'm good. There we go. I just had to get... Look
[563.06s -> 571.64s]  at this. Are you kidding me? This is like what happens when like... I'm like a 16-year-old
[571.64s -> 579.08s]  playing in the Little League. Like my parents lied about my age. Oh, he has 60 home runs this year?
[579.96s -> 588.12s]  Yeah, he's 12. Oh, are you sure he's not like 15? No, that's my son. He's good.
[593.72s -> 605.98s]  Wow. Zero points. Bad. Come on. Usually I'm the one over there in that next ranking.
[606.70s -> 611.34s]  You know what I mean? Usually I have to look at the guy next to me that has a thousand points.
[611.90s -> 623.42s]  Not this time. I think this is... If I remember, this is like a Mario Party where they give out
[623.42s -> 628.84s]  points at the end for like how many times you got hit in the head or something. Chicken Race
[628.84s -> 640.30s]  at Acne Canyon. Good luck. Use the power gauge to set the strength of the rubber band and run
[640.30s -> 644.70s]  towards the cliff. Try to stop as close to the edge of the cliff as you possibly can.
[645.66s -> 654.94s]  You can only use your brakes once. Be careful. You fall to fouls. Imagine a game where they
[654.94s -> 689.85s]  launched you at a cliff and you had to stop. Here we go. All right. Stop. Okay. Be cautious
[689.85s -> 708.10s]  this time. Second try. Okay. It's 250 to qualify. I have to get 250. I'm not going to go that fast.
[708.10s -> 733.99s]  That was the problem. I went into red. How did I take that? 290. I'm good. Chicken Dash. 290.
[735.16s -> 744.65s]  Speed bonus. Boopy prize. Okay. Wait. Buster's getting up kind of close. I don't like where he
[744.65s -> 752.02s]  is. Third event is weightlifting at the TV station. Good luck. All right. I got to listen up to this
[752.02s -> 759.37s]  one. It's all about saving that power gauge. You lift the barrel before the others. You make three
[759.37s -> 765.42s]  lifts. You get the top points. If you're too slow, you're out of the competition. Save up a lot of
[765.42s -> 778.55s]  strength or you'll drop the barbell. Yeah. You just have to power. Just lift. It's not about
[778.55s -> 808.20s]  getting the little ones. It's about getting one huge one. Fuck. Out of here. I went. Oh, hand me
[808.20s -> 820.20s]  the controller, Jeremy. Look at how fucking huge. That's how huge I am. He's just the Hulk. 110.
[821.08s -> 839.27s]  Oh, wow. Buster failed. Buster couldn't even do it. 750 subs. Wait. What? We have to do it twice?
[839.27s -> 842.63s]  Okay. Well, it doesn't even matter. I destroyed it. Let me see if I can get it in one go.
[843.67s -> 882.14s]  Shit. It doesn't matter. You got to get it right on that needle. Buster didn't even try. Can we do
[882.14s -> 888.15s]  it again? Should I just not even pick it up? I've already qualified for the playoffs. Oh,
[888.15s -> 908.57s]  it's just me and her. Wait a minute. I went. One try. First fucking try. I just threw that
[908.57s -> 918.89s]  thing into the ceiling. That's guaranteed that I win. Oh, no. Just challenge. What do you mean
[918.89s -> 926.09s]  challenge? My arms are already tired. How did I do this when I was a kid for like fucking six
[926.09s -> 951.06s]  straight hours? How did I do this when I was a kid? How? My arms. I already need to be relieved
[951.06s -> 969.66s]  already. Stretch it out. Okay. I've won. I did so well in the first few competitions that
[970.62s -> 974.71s]  saucer throw. Okay. Then I can just literally throw this one in the ground and I just still win.
[975.59s -> 983.08s]  Power gauge and go around the circle. Decide the angle and let it go.
[983.88s -> 993.46s]  Don't throw it out of bounds. Go to the bathroom. I'm good. All right. They have all 321.
[994.34s -> 1002.41s]  Here we go. How much time do I have?
[1013.86s -> 1022.97s]  There we go. That's not coming back. That thing's going to get picked up by gravity.
[1024.17s -> 1043.42s]  Okay. I don't want it. Second try. Oh my God. Why did I think I still had a 14-year-old body?
[1044.60s -> 1048.60s]  I was like growing up. I was growing. My bones were strong. I was drinking milk every day.
[1049.72s -> 1074.84s]  I was like 15. I was strong. 16. I could pick up a fucking car. Midlife crisis.
[1077.32s -> 1091.82s]  No, there's no such thing as a midlife crisis for me. All right. This is...
[1094.31s -> 1099.27s]  I win. Fifth event is obstacle course at Acme Acres. Good luck, everyone.
[1100.23s -> 1106.22s]  Thing is though, I have to destroy this because it keeps getting up. It keeps ramping up in
[1106.22s -> 1114.10s]  difficulty and the events change to be way harder. Run collect as many items as you can.
[1115.08s -> 1121.80s]  Pump your opponents. Avoid Elmyra and hit by jumping. Oh, how do you jump? Wait, how do I
[1121.80s -> 1147.16s]  control it? How do you control? Just run? I don't understand. I don't know how you run.
[1147.88s -> 1170.92s]  Why do I keep falling back? Is it A? Why do I keep just falling backwards? What do I have to press?
[1171.88s -> 1205.30s]  It's X. It's fucking X. Okay. No. Come back at the sentry right here. Give me this shit.
[1205.30s -> 1214.36s]  I just have to beat the fat guy. That's all I care about. I have to beat this fat guy.
[1215.08s -> 1231.40s]  Did I win? Oh, I can't brawl. Whatever. It's okay. It don't matter. I can cure it.
[1232.12s -> 1245.66s]  If I didn't get a jump bonus, trip bonus. Oh, I fell down the most time. Okay, boss. So you
[1246.06s -> 1256.70s]  can't even sniff my score. That's how far away I am. Last competition. Birdman contest
[1257.58s -> 1268.14s]  in the tropics. Good luck. Fly as fast as you can. If you get a certain number of targets,
[1268.14s -> 1278.33s]  you can climb a wire and then aim for Montana Max's mansion. Speed, brake. Okay. It's just speed
[1278.33s -> 1295.67s]  and brake. That's it. There's only two things. Do I have to spam first? No. Okay. Just apply.
[1296.63s -> 1319.24s]  Okay. How does any other character fly in this game? Take the brakes. Oh, it's time. I have a
[1319.24s -> 1342.81s]  time limit. Wait, can I do it? I'm trying to land it up. Cut it. Cut it. Cut the wheel.
[1343.37s -> 1361.32s]  Why didn't I take the parachute off? Why wouldn't I take the... Wait, was I just going to...
[1362.28s -> 1375.21s]  I would just die. What was I expecting to happen there? Smash into his ceiling and instantly die?
[1376.17s -> 1392.54s]  I got to figure... I mean, I don't... What would have happened? It's not like you lost because you
[1392.54s -> 1406.58s]  lived. All right. Number one. Maybe. Because he doesn't even get a place on the board. Password.
[1407.75s -> 1417.37s]  Okay. Somebody remember that. Write that down. It's Wile E. Coyote Jr., Road Runner Jr., and
[1417.37s -> 1428.68s]  Montana Max. All right. Somebody remember that. Next, try the normal course. Do your best.
[1430.84s -> 1439.85s]  We keep upgrading. The first event is Ski Race. Let's do our best. Ski down the hill and grab as
[1439.85s -> 1443.85s]  many point flags as you can. You can jump and land on the others to slow them down.
[1444.73s -> 1450.31s]  If you turn into a snowball, you'll be out of control. It's just move and jump. That's it.
[1451.03s -> 1476.23s]  No, it's just move around and collect the flags. Get out of here. Don't fall off the edge.
[1477.75s -> 1486.73s]  That's 30 points, but what? All right. Now just be conservative with this.
[1488.14s -> 1497.06s]  Destroying them. Dude, I'm fucking liking this song. Put your hand down. I can't.
[1497.78s -> 1519.16s]  I put your fucking... I can't fucking put my hand down. This is a generic face sign. Yeah.
[1519.88s -> 1527.35s]  I mean, it's... It is because you can always tell when there's a really generic face line
[1527.35s -> 1534.86s]  when the bass guitar is just counting to seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One,
[1534.86s -> 1540.22s]  two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three,
[1540.22s -> 1554.46s]  four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Well, this is... I'm doing...
[1554.46s -> 1558.30s]  I need the points because you know I'm going to fuck something up eventually. Eventually,
[1558.30s -> 1566.30s]  it can't be this good the whole time. I remember the log cutting one. There's a wood cutting
[1566.30s -> 1578.65s]  composition eventually in it. It always fucked me up and I always get so angry. Give me like a
[1578.65s -> 1588.90s]  thousand points. What the fuck? I want 500 points. 500 points or I'm going to uninstall the game.
[1591.21s -> 1604.66s]  It's not like on Steam. I'm going to get a Steam refund. Come on, speed it up a little bit. Let's
[1604.66s -> 1625.51s]  get that bass line. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. You can count to eight. Am I?
[1627.21s -> 1643.32s]  What does the booby bonus mean? Booby prize. No one gets it. What is it? Chicken race. Oh, no.
[1644.28s -> 1658.98s]  Okay, so it's 300 to qualify. This is the run killer. This is the run killer. I need 300.
[1658.98s -> 1693.11s]  Yeah, we got it. Max is 400. Hey, super frog. Thank you Burnout for that. I don't know why I
[1693.11s -> 1698.38s]  even said that. I'm so used to just doing that. Thanks for the five community subs, Burnout.
[1702.39s -> 1717.72s]  I don't know why I did that. Thank you Burnout for the five subs. 350, good. That's not super
[1717.88s -> 1736.87s]  good. Zero and zero for Dizzy. I feel bad for Dizzy. All right, still in the lead by a lot.
[1739.38s -> 1745.75s]  I can really easily lose this if I fuck up a whole entire event. Ice cream throw. Uh-oh.
[1746.55s -> 1766.02s]  Okay, just be good. 350 to qualify for this ice cream throw. It's not all there. He's fine.
[1766.02s -> 1798.76s]  Did they give me a head start? That's a risky move over there. Fuck, I was going for that one.
[1798.76s -> 1823.27s]  Nice. They all fucked up. I got it. I qualified. The fuck? Hey. Hey, don't have a fuck with the
[1823.27s -> 1829.43s]  guy whose main weapon in Team Fortress was the Huntsman. Bleeding targets. Blue plate special.
[1834.84s -> 1842.04s]  Oh, and there he is. Super frog. Thank you Super Bruce for the five community subs.
[1845.78s -> 1861.26s]  Super Bruce five subs. Use the Luxman. What? You guys want to give me shit for being the guy that
[1861.26s -> 1869.90s]  every time that cough nucleus showed up. I just played Huntsman the whole time and just aimed at
[1869.90s -> 1874.78s]  that area where you could shoot down that long winding hallway into where the people spawned out
[1874.78s -> 1881.03s]  the door. Just get a headshot every eight seconds. But am I the bad, am I a bad guy for that?
[1881.91s -> 1894.01s]  Apparently. Bull vault. Gather your speed by hitting the buttons and plant the pole and decide the
[1894.09s -> 1899.96s]  angle and you're off. Try to catch as many stars as you can. If you miss a jump, it's a foul. Hold on.
[1900.76s -> 1906.94s]  I wear one, power two. Do I have to alternate? Shit. I don't know what to do.
[1909.43s -> 1938.62s]  To alternate or do I just spam? Whoa! I missed. Oh shit. I didn't go for the pole.
[1939.66s -> 1955.78s]  Does it matter? I can't move over this way. I landed. Oh shit, don't even matter. I went under
[1955.78s -> 1968.06s]  the pole. I got to land on the squishy thing. All right, it's fine. I can lose this. I don't care.
[1968.06s -> 1994.10s]  Wait, what's the qualify? 300? Holy shit. Wait, get these pink ones. Get a pink one. Yes. 410.
[1994.10s -> 2007.18s]  All right, just land on the thing. Where's the thing? Where's the thing? I don't know what the
[2007.18s -> 2036.18s]  thing is. I win. I like this song. Landing bonus. Boobie prize. Hey, Duke. Thanks for the five
[2036.18s -> 2047.72s]  community subs. You're good. Thank you. Five subs. Rolling in. Fifth event is weightlifting.
[2048.52s -> 2053.14s]  Do our best. All right. I'm usually really good at this shit. I want to blow this thing.
[2053.14s -> 2068.01s]  Do weightlifting. Got to get three lifts. Not on easy mode. It's on normal mode.
[2068.01s -> 2104.84s]  Oh, lost her pretty good. I want to see Dizzy's evolution. We never get to see it. We just get
[2104.84s -> 2142.52s]  to see the germ of Pluto face. I did this three times. Wait. Oh, he's out forever. I feel bad.
[2142.52s -> 2149.67s]  All right. I have to win. How did I get gifted if I'm not watching? How does that work?
[2151.27s -> 2166.44s]  What are you trying to prove by playing this game? Do I have to be in a constant state of proving
[2166.44s -> 2173.77s]  myself? What? Why? Don't you know every single second of every day is a constant?
[2173.77s -> 2191.88s]  You need to prove something to someone else. I can't let him fucking beat me. Oh, that was bad.
[2194.30s -> 2211.21s]  Oh. Okay. He's trying to prove. What would I want to prove with this? Hey, guys, you know,
[2211.21s -> 2214.89s]  I just want to tell you this. Super Nintendo, I can hit the button real fast. I mean,
