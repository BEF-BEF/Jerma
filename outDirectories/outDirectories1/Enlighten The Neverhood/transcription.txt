[0.57s -> 5.93s]  Hey what's going on everybody, Jerma here with the first ever episode of Enlighten.
[5.93s -> 12.09s]  That's the title I'm gonna be using I guess. Enlighten is a series I'm doing where I go back in time
[12.65s -> 17.29s]  and I pick a title that was overlooked by a lot of people or didn't really sell that well but it was
[17.29s -> 22.74s]  still a fantastic game that you have to check out. And the first title I'm gonna go over is
[22.74s -> 27.14s]  something called The Neverhood. Some of you might know what this game is but a lot of you don't
[27.14s -> 33.30s]  because it sold so awfully and was released at such an odd time in gaming's history that
[33.30s -> 38.58s]  it went under the radar, very very much so. And it's unfortunate because the creator,
[38.58s -> 42.98s]  Doug Tenable, this is kind of his baby, he's the guy that if you don't know who Doug Tenable is,
[42.98s -> 49.14s]  he created Earthworm Jim. He's the guy responsible for Earthworm Jim so that alone is the reason why
[49.14s -> 53.64s]  you should check out this game. So what do you say we get started? I'm gonna do this very very much
[53.64s -> 58.04s]  in a review style, gonna show you a whole lot of clips, gonna show you a whole lot of stuff,
[58.04s -> 62.52s]  condense it down, you know the deal. So what do you say we go back in time?
[69.08s -> 76.04s]  The year is 1996 and the age of PC gaming is just starting to flourish. Large companies were
[76.04s -> 80.84s]  starting to realize that video games not only could function well on the PC but compete with
[80.84s -> 86.44s]  the popular gaming consoles. This was also the tail end of the adventure game era, a certain
[86.44s -> 90.92s]  genre that had players problem solve and pay attention to detail rather than shoot up a room
[90.92s -> 96.68s]  full of enemies. The Neverhood is one of those games and unfortunately the room full of enemies
[96.68s -> 103.56s]  I just mentioned is the reason why this game was killed. Selling just 42,000 copies, which by today's
[103.56s -> 109.32s]  standards is like getting hit by a tornado, the Neverhood died out fairly quickly, which is very
[109.32s -> 116.12s]  unfortunate because this game is absolutely in my top five greatest games of all time, all time,
[116.12s -> 124.20s]  and here's why. If you want to talk about style points for a game, the Neverhood is absolutely
[124.20s -> 130.28s]  off the charts when it comes to style. Everything you see, every environment, every person, every
[130.28s -> 136.76s]  character, everything was crafted entirely out of clay. There's no camera tricks, there's no CGI,
[136.76s -> 142.92s]  everything is real, in real space, and I think that adds a lot to the realism of the game and
[142.92s -> 148.68s]  how you can get lost in games like this. Too many games nowadays don't imply real space.
[148.68s -> 153.32s]  I find it a lot easier to fall into these characters and get sucked into the world when
[153.32s -> 159.16s]  they're actually real. I feel the same way with movies. You go back to John Carpenter's The Thing
[159.16s -> 163.72s]  or one of the Alien movies or any movie that actually had real creatures in it that were
[163.72s -> 168.36s]  crafted by an animatronic or by Jim Henson, you're going to talk about much more realism
[168.36s -> 178.30s]  and much more frightening things. So the plot of this game is you play a character named Clayman
[178.30s -> 183.74s]  who just wakes up on the ground with no backstory, nothing is there, there's no introduction, you just
[183.74s -> 189.58s]  appear on the ground, and it is your duty as the player to find out why you're even playing the
[189.58s -> 194.62s]  game in the first place. You do this by collecting these random cassette tapes that happen to be on
[194.62s -> 199.50s]  the ground all over the world. You then take those tapes and put them in these various tape
[199.50s -> 204.70s]  players that play the entire story. Once you collect all the tapes, you pretty much complete
[204.70s -> 215.06s]  the game. These discs are all that are left of the true story, true story of the closing of the third
[215.06s -> 222.02s]  age. This is a fantastic example of reverse storytelling where nobody tells you anything,
[222.02s -> 226.26s]  you don't get any info, you don't get any hints, you just figure it all out on your own.
[226.26s -> 229.94s]  And the story is actually very very interesting, it's not one of those games where you get to the
[229.94s -> 242.18s]  end and you go, oh well that was stupid. It's actually a pretty good story. Like any adventure
[242.18s -> 248.18s]  game, the gameplay revolves around problem solving and puzzles. The difficulty can be described as
[248.18s -> 254.50s]  stupidly easy to tear your hair out of your skull difficult. There's actually a puzzle in this game
[254.50s -> 259.62s]  that mimics memory, if you know what memory is. Memory is the game where you flip over tiles and
[259.62s -> 265.70s]  you have to match different icons. That's great and all, but in this version if you miss one time
[265.70s -> 271.40s]  or if you mess up once, the entire board is deleted. Which brings me to the next point about the
[271.40s -> 278.28s]  gameplay, get a pen and paper. You're gonna need to write down a lot of stuff. I would actually
[278.28s -> 283.80s]  say if you do not write down half of the information you see in this game, you will never complete it,
[283.80s -> 295.05s]  you will never beat the game. The game is also fairly short. If you blaze through every task and
[295.05s -> 299.29s]  you don't spend a whole lot of time exploring the world, you can beat this game in less than two
[299.29s -> 304.41s]  hours. But you don't really play this game for the gameplay. You play this game for the sheer amount
[304.41s -> 310.89s]  of style, the unbelievable cast of characters and you get to see a game that was created not for money
[310.89s -> 316.74s]  but for passion, art and creativity. Those are the reasons why you play this game and it's not
[316.74s -> 321.78s]  something you can sit here and watch, it's something that you have to experience. And hopefully there's
[322.26s -> 327.70s]  a rumor going around that the Neverhood is gonna make it to mobile devices, whether that be iPad,
[327.70s -> 333.06s]  iPhone, Android. So hopefully that all goes through because that would be amazing if we could all play
[333.06s -> 337.78s]  this game and pay a little bit of money for it, pay the developers what they actually deserve rather
[337.78s -> 343.38s]  than have them get thrown under the bus for years. So hopefully you guys check this game out, I really
[343.38s -> 348.90s]  do recommend you do it. I will see you guys all next time and enjoy yourself in the Neverhood.
[348.90s -> 350.90s]  Take care everybody.
