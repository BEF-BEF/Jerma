[21.94s -> 31.32s]  Oh, hi, didn't see you there. Yeah, I did actually. How you doing? I'm doing okay. Where should I sit here?
[31.88s -> 37.18s]  Or sit here like this? So you can get like a full-on like face reaction to my fucking d-
[37.18s -> 43.06s]  Oh, look at all the cool stuff and game rewards. How- what- what's- why is there no uh stream?
[43.78s -> 53.14s]  I don't understand. Oh, they usually have like a big like 25 advertisements before every one of these?
[53.86s -> 55.58s]  I missed it?
[55.58s -> 58.60s]  What do you mean I missed it?
[58.60s -> 64.25s]  No, it says live December 10th. I didn't miss it. Hold on. I gotta tweet this.
[67.37s -> 69.37s]  I missed the stream.
[69.61s -> 74.28s]  That would be embarrassing.
[74.28s -> 78.09s]  It was yesterday.
[78.09s -> 84.31s]  Got a bunch of- got a bunch of community injured here. But what is today?
[84.95s -> 88.70s]  What is actually today?
[88.70s -> 97.13s]  Actually refresh though. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Why is this so- this doesn't make any sense. Why does it look like this?
[97.69s -> 102.82s]  Oh, okay. There we go.
[102.82s -> 105.46s]  Okay. So hold on. I don't have to follow the- refresh the page.
[106.18s -> 118.62s]  Is it going? It's not even going. What's this?
[120.92s -> 122.44s]  Jeff Q&A.
[122.44s -> 124.44s]  Riot Games. Chat Choice Awards.
[125.22s -> 127.54s]  Game Awards. No, where's the actual live stream?
[128.10s -> 134.55s]  Why didn't you shave? I don't know.
[134.55s -> 137.67s]  Click that one. Can I stream that one? What's the rules here?
[140.46s -> 142.46s]  What are the actual rules?
[144.34s -> 149.62s]  This- um, this is why I only want to get here 15 minutes early. My pre-show- you think I have anything for my pre-show?
[150.18s -> 154.74s]  No, I played like three games that have been nominated this year and one of them I played for like an hour.
[155.94s -> 162.79s]  I- you don't want to be here for this- for me. I have a terrible sense of what is cool this year.
[163.27s -> 165.27s]  I took like three months off.
[165.35s -> 170.79s]  I played like 12 video games. Spit just flew out of my mouth. That's how you can tell I'm really rabid tonight.
[176.65s -> 181.67s]  Is it- what can I watch? Sing the pre-show song.
[184.52s -> 190.41s]  Hot Chocke? Oh, man, it's hot. No, it's not. Oh, look at my gross mouth spots.
[191.21s -> 196.14s]  Oh! Can you see this?
[198.52s -> 203.19s]  How am I drinking this coffee?
[203.51s -> 205.51s]  Am I going like-
[205.51s -> 209.11s]  Look at this like a bunch of like mouth like spots and like water.
[209.75s -> 219.08s]  There's like a lipstick on here.
[219.16s -> 221.56s]  I think there's actually lipstick on this cup.
[222.20s -> 234.62s]  Can you see the like lipstick mark?
[244.33s -> 246.65s]  Ew, ew, ew. Evil lighting too?
[250.57s -> 258.20s]  I didn't show any nudes on stream. All right, everybody relax. What time is it? 324? When does this thing start?
[263.02s -> 264.81s]  Okay, so
[264.81s -> 267.13s]  Let's think- let's think about you're handsome.
[282.62s -> 285.46s]  Not anymore!
[285.46s -> 287.54s]  Yeah, but on- I don't know. What's my good side?
[288.10s -> 290.74s]  Let's find this out. I don't know who gives a shit about the game awards.
[290.74s -> 300.28s]  Let's talk about my- me and how like got my appearance. What's my good side, you guys think? I don't. Okay, so this is me.
[300.92s -> 311.24s]  What's like the good side?
[311.24s -> 313.67s]  Both? What's worse?
[313.83s -> 317.03s]  I think this side's probably the bad side. If I would take a- if it would be me in the mirror.
[318.60s -> 320.84s]  All right, I gotta talk about like video games. This is getting weird.
[320.84s -> 323.56s]  This is like I'm like a weird guy that's like obsessed with himself.
[323.72s -> 327.72s]  You know, one of my good sides over here, but I don't know about this one. I think this looks okay this way too.
[328.36s -> 333.96s]  Like it's the fucking game awards tonight. You know, what did I play this year? I'm gonna do a pre-show.
[334.44s -> 340.09s]  What did I play this year? I came out this year.
[340.65s -> 350.79s]  Put your head on the statue. This is- I don't know, this feels weird. I played Doodle God. Hades, yes.
[350.87s -> 353.11s]  All right, if I want Hades to win something, I really do.
[355.46s -> 358.73s]  Hades came out this year.
[358.73s -> 362.20s]  Um, Bug Snacks? What else did I play?
[363.78s -> 366.26s]  Watch Dogs? Watch Dogs is not gonna get nominated for anything.
[366.50s -> 370.42s]  And if it does, like if Watch Dogs is on there for game of the year, I don't even look, I don't even care.
[372.23s -> 374.31s]  Half-Life Alex, but that didn't come out this year, did it?
[374.95s -> 381.75s]  Did Half-Life Alex come out in 2020? Half-Life Alex came out in 2020?
[383.27s -> 386.15s]  Oh shit. All right. Why is that- that was probably the game of the year.
[386.97s -> 390.58s]  Is that not on game of the year?
[390.58s -> 395.67s]  I would say that would be game of the year for me. It's not even on the list.
[399.03s -> 401.03s]  Why the fuck would that not be on the list?
[402.47s -> 404.68s]  How is that?
[404.68s -> 406.12s]  It's a snub.
[406.12s -> 408.12s]  Well, because nobody has VR.
[408.28s -> 411.00s]  It's because like only like 2% of people have VR. That's kind of weird.
[411.48s -> 421.14s]  But it's like it's probably the best game that I played this year.
[421.22s -> 426.18s]  So why wouldn't it, you know, are we judging it based on the merits of how good a game was or judging it based on
[426.90s -> 429.94s]  how many like Twitter followers the social media account has?
[430.82s -> 434.02s]  Like how many Twitter followers does like the fucking Ubisoft Watch Dogs account have?
[434.58s -> 440.26s]  How many active Reddit users are inside? Yeah.
[440.82s -> 444.04s]  I mean how many active Reddit users are current- are like voting?
[444.52s -> 449.29s]  But that doesn't make any sense because Val- Half-Life Alex is like a huge Reddit game. What are you talking about?
[449.29s -> 450.65s]  Everybody loves that game.
[450.65s -> 460.54s]  If that's the barometer, it's not right then. It's not- it's not accurate. It's a popularity contest germo.
[461.61s -> 469.56s]  The Valve is wicked popular up the stream. What time is it? 328. What else we got?
[469.64s -> 471.64s]  All right, so Half-Life Alex is probably my game of the year.
[472.36s -> 473.32s]  I would say.
[473.32s -> 477.32s]  Well, let me get like a couple more clanks in there so you can like really tell I'm sitting down having a coffee with you.
[478.38s -> 481.82s]  I think um, no, that's ASMR shit. I'm not gonna do that. I'll leave that be.
[483.22s -> 490.28s]  Hades was good too. I'd say Hades. No villain hair. No, I did. I put- which is my hair recently has been really like wavy.
[490.92s -> 492.04s]  I tried.
[492.04s -> 497.72s]  I put a bunch of water in it and like I've really like tried to like get it to go back, but it's too short.
[497.88s -> 508.47s]  So it won't stay back. It just won't- it won't stay back. It's gonna be like this.
[510.07s -> 512.87s]  Wait, it hasn't even started. The game awards haven't even started yet. I got time.
[513.27s -> 516.38s]  I just go throw water in my hair and get ready.
[517.02s -> 520.06s]  I gotta get ready for the game awards, man. I gotta like slick my hair back.
[520.70s -> 529.78s]  Do it on camera? I don't have a sink in here. Where do you see a sink?
[531.94s -> 534.02s]  Dunk your head in water and come back here like-
[534.82s -> 537.62s]  All right, I'm ready. I'm gonna look like sweaty. Why am I sweaty? No.
[538.18s -> 542.10s]  That's just the light. I got a little light in here now so you can like illuminate my face for you.
[544.14s -> 546.14s]  You're in the bathroom right now.
[548.90s -> 557.38s]  You're always like this. I know. Look, I'm a pretty sweaty guy, okay? Look. You got like sweaty lips.
[558.86s -> 561.02s]  I've got- I've got like sweaty teeth.
[561.82s -> 564.50s]  See? There's like sweat coming off my teeth.
[570.47s -> 573.03s]  Lip gloss. It's fucking chapstick. Sit down.
[573.97s -> 576.81s]  Relax.
[576.89s -> 578.89s]  You got Gary Busey teeth.
[586.31s -> 589.51s]  Hey, they're big and they can chew through food very quickly.
[591.66s -> 596.22s]  Oh, you know, you're at the burger place. Oh, man. I really can't like bite into this burger. It's like it's too big.
[596.30s -> 598.30s]  It's too much. I go like-
[600.46s -> 602.46s]  And when I bite into this shit,
[602.46s -> 607.18s]  meat and cheese goes out the sides and like splats on the walls and stuff and everyone's like looks over they go
[607.18s -> 612.74s]  Holy shit, that dude- that dude's teeth must be on point. They look over and I go yeah, they are.
[614.17s -> 616.17s]  You ever need me to bite through metal?
[616.95s -> 623.34s]  I'll do it. Excuse me, sir. Sir, I noticed that you bit into that hamburger really well.
[623.50s -> 625.50s]  Could you- could you break this copper for me?
[627.19s -> 641.08s]  That'll be $40. Fucking show gonna start already. Is it live?
[641.72s -> 644.04s]  Hold on. Wait. I didn't even put my head in the water.
[644.68s -> 651.21s]  It did. It's live. It's live. It's live. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it actually live or are you lying to me?
[658.53s -> 661.14s]  Offline.
[661.22s -> 668.22s]  Liars. Liars. All of you. Press the refresh on the page. Hold on. I do have to- I already did.
[669.53s -> 671.53s]  You missed the show.
[675.02s -> 690.20s]  Okay, I'm refreshing the whole page. Oh, it's Pepe Laugh. Pepe Laugh. Pepe Laugh. We got him. Pepe Laugh. Pepe Laugh.
[690.20s -> 694.44s]  I'm laughing at this guy because he thinks he had to refresh the bucket page. I got it. I understand.
[695.16s -> 699.64s]  But now I have to do this again.
[699.64s -> 702.97s]  You have really slow internet.
[702.97s -> 708.28s]  It's 3 32 right now.
[708.36s -> 712.87s]  Should be on.
[712.87s -> 715.58s]  No? Oh, wait.
[715.66s -> 716.86s]  Oh.
[716.86s -> 721.19s]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[721.19s -> 723.75s]  Oh, it's an ad. Wait, it's an ad. Okay. It's an ad.
[732.58s -> 735.86s]  Okay. All right. All right. By the way, 5G. That's never gonna roll out everywhere.
[736.10s -> 740.10s]  You'll be able to do 5G in like five places. That's why it's called 5G.
[740.18s -> 742.66s]  It's gonna be in like five major cities in like a 200 yard radius.
[743.22s -> 747.10s]  The following program may contain content that some viewers might find offensive.
[749.70s -> 751.70s]  Can you hear it? Are we good? Are we live?
[752.02s -> 760.66s]  Good men here coming to you live from Los Angeles, California. From Las Vegas.
[761.38s -> 767.86s]  Damn it. Damn it. And please allow me to be the first to thank you for setting down cyberpunk for a few hours.
[768.42s -> 772.42s]  As you can probably tell the game awards are going to look a little different this year.
[772.90s -> 777.46s]  Our venue may be smaller, but the show itself is as gigantic as ever.
[777.94s -> 780.58s]  The awards and world premieres won't be changing except
[780.74s -> 785.22s]  I guess the only people clapping will be me and probably a few crew members. Oh, right.
[786.02s -> 793.14s]  We'll bring us musical performances from London and Tokyo and one positive of tonight's mostly digital gathering is
[793.46s -> 799.06s]  we'll get to see more faces in the talented teams behind this year's outstanding games. What the hell is going on here?
[799.94s -> 806.58s]  As for us here in the pre-show, we'll be setting the remaining minutes before the game awards kick off with brand new trailers,
[806.96s -> 813.70s]  mercifully brief integrated marketing, and Lin will be performing a song from Persona 5 Strikers.
[814.18s -> 816.82s]  Oh, you guys be excited about that one. The big reason we're all here.
[817.54s -> 822.86s]  Awards. Our first category tonight is best score in music. It's just going right into it.
[822.86s -> 828.30s]  It's a particularly strong contest this year with five standout nominees that could on their own
[828.60s -> 835.98s]  represent the best of the generation. What's good music? Here are the nominees for best score in music. Best score in music. Doom Eternal.
[836.30s -> 840.46s]  Nice, Doom. Play Doom OST. Final Fantasy 7 Remake. No, I don't know. Hades. Yeah.
[841.02s -> 847.42s]  Ori and the Will of the Wisps. I didn't play it, but sure. And the Last of Us Part 2. Didn't play it. I don't know. And the winner is?
[847.98s -> 849.98s]  It's gonna be Doom Eternal or Hades. It's gonna be Hades.
[850.30s -> 856.46s]  Final Fantasy 7 Remake. We already know those songs. We already heard them 20 years ago.
[867.32s -> 869.72s]  All right. The music's good. It's good. It's good.
[870.76s -> 880.52s]  All right. Now the music's good, but we already heard those songs.
[881.00s -> 885.72s]  As I said earlier, you'll be seeing a variety of different world premieres throughout this pre-show.
[885.80s -> 891.00s]  Oh, give us some world premieres. Strangely enough, we've decided to show you our most important one first. Here it is.
[891.64s -> 894.41s]  What?
[894.41s -> 900.65s]  Oh, the digits go. Elden Ring. Come on. Welcome to the Devolver Digital 2021 Game of the Year Award.
[901.13s -> 906.65s]  Sponsored by Devolver Digital. And now, your host, Devolver Digital CEO,
[907.37s -> 909.37s]  Nita Struthers.
[909.93s -> 911.69s]  Oh, guys.
[911.69s -> 918.31s]  Okay, shush it. So yeah, tonight we are here to celebrate this year's most memorable video games.
[918.39s -> 921.11s]  Let's not overlook the unrelenting hype, not for this,
[921.59s -> 928.31s]  but for next year's as yet to be released games coming at you hot from what many believe to be this industry's most ridiculously
[928.85s -> 934.95s]  overrated publisher. While most of these games are months away from release, we at Devolver Digital are strong
[935.49s -> 942.63s]  proponents of awards for awards sake. And with that, the nominees for the Devolver Digital 2021
[943.51s -> 951.43s]  Game of the Year are Shadow Warrior 3 by Flying Wild Hog. It's from, yeah. Oliya by Skeleton Crew Studio.
[952.37s -> 954.37s]  Card Shark by Neria.
[955.03s -> 957.03s]  Family, like a baby.
[960.18s -> 963.99s]  By Dane.
[963.99s -> 967.19s]  Devs, Baby Devs.
[967.27s -> 969.59s]  Lupiro by Developer Four Quarters.
[978.60s -> 980.60s]  Kind of wish the baby like burped cute through the camera.
[980.68s -> 984.04s]  Well, just now, really. Let's have a look at Lupiro.
[985.32s -> 988.44s]  Your world has been cast into a dark spiral.
[989.96s -> 993.32s]  Place enchanted cards along a heroiney path.
[995.10s -> 997.10s]  What am I supposed to say?
[997.10s -> 1001.02s]  Just build cathedrals and remember your world.
[1001.82s -> 1007.58s]  Scrounges for weapons, armor, and mystical items to level up your hero.
[1008.38s -> 1014.38s]  Expand your camp, customize your card deck, and uncover secrets.
[1015.42s -> 1020.46s]  Feast the lich, break the spiral, and see the world.
[1023.00s -> 1027.00s]  Lupiro, coming in 2021.
[1027.08s -> 1029.56s]  Hey, here's every single one of these streams you're gonna watch on Twitch.
[1029.80s -> 1031.80s]  Thank you. See you next year.
[1032.12s -> 1038.33s]  Whatever
[1039.29s -> 1046.25s]  Every year the Game Awards do our best to highlight new games from all sorts of developers from AAA big shots like Devolver
[1046.57s -> 1048.57s]  to smaller independent studios.
[1048.97s -> 1056.57s]  Our next world premiere is the debut of a new game from Awaseb, a young studio started in New Caledonia. Enjoy.
[1057.05s -> 1061.05s]  Here we go. Another world premiere. Let's go back to back world premieres. Back to back jacks.
[1061.21s -> 1062.97s]  Back to back jacks.
[1062.97s -> 1076.18s]  Crap.
[1076.18s -> 1080.86s]  Oh shit.
[1101.00s -> 1121.45s]  You can fall from really high places. What the hell?
[1136.17s -> 1138.17s]  You can be a coconut.
[1151.70s -> 1158.74s]  Oh, that's all right. Let's go to coal. How do you get out though?
[1160.94s -> 1166.22s]  This next award category is for one of gaming's most popular genres, action adventure.
[1167.34s -> 1173.66s]  The breadth of what is considered an action adventure game also leads to this regularly being one of our most competitive categories.
[1174.20s -> 1180.94s]  Incidentally for the past three years the game award winner for action adventure has gone on to win game of the year.
[1181.74s -> 1183.18s]  This is a big one.
[1183.18s -> 1186.22s]  Here are the nominees for best action adventure game.
[1187.00s -> 1189.00s]  Assassin's Creed Valhalla
[1189.56s -> 1194.36s]  Ghost of Tsushima. I haven't seen one second. Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales. I haven't played it.
[1194.36s -> 1198.68s]  I want to play. Hori and the will of the wisp. Should I be doing this? Star Wars Jedi fall in order.
[1198.76s -> 1204.36s]  I didn't play any of these. And the last of us part two. Holy shit. I haven't played a single one of these the entire year.
[1205.24s -> 1208.69s]  What kind of comments are you gonna get from me? The last of us part two.
[1210.00s -> 1212.00s]  Wow, we won. This is awesome.
[1212.24s -> 1216.80s]  We want to thank the game awards for choosing us as the best action adventure game. Oh the best of known beforehand.
[1216.96s -> 1220.48s]  On behalf of the directors, which is myself, Anthony Newman and Neil Druckmann.
[1220.56s -> 1225.76s]  They definitely knew before it. We want to thank the entire team at Naughty Dog who poured their heart and souls into this game.
[1226.08s -> 1231.68s]  It's really their talent. Oh, they probably all did one. It merges you in that world and really makes you feel like you're on this journey with Ellie.
[1232.32s -> 1235.04s]  We want to thank Evan Wells our president.
[1235.68s -> 1240.72s]  Also everyone at Sony and our partners for really helping us put this game together and get out the door.
[1242.32s -> 1244.32s]  And especially to our fans who
[1244.64s -> 1246.64s]  supported us and
[1247.28s -> 1251.68s]  really helped make this game something special. You guys make it worth it. So thank you again.
[1251.76s -> 1255.60s]  So you have to assume that every single one of these people has to do a we won.
[1256.16s -> 1259.76s]  Oh, I won. We have many more awards coming up in the pre-show.

[5609.54s -> 5612.60s]  Protagonists helping to tell the story of the game with our choices

[5896.19s -> 5902.19s]  We see other big colleges are able to have these gaming teams and they're winning scholarships for us not to have it
[5902.19s -> 5905.95s]  We were like this is a lack. We need to get rid of this lack
[5907.47s -> 5913.55s]  We're just a collection of hbcu's who have different passionate gamers who want to compete against one another

[5944.16s -> 5947.68s]  Olympic sized, but that's not olympic the the olympic one is indoors
[5948.32s -> 5953.68s]  But I know that there are some people out there watching this that are depending on things like vaping to try to calm themselves down
[5954.00s -> 5954.88s]  however
[5954.88s -> 5962.16s]  the high levels of nicotine that you can be inhaling can actually worsen your anxiety and just kind of fight against the mental health battle that is

[9595.44s -> 9597.44s]  I was trying to rise
[9597.68s -> 9599.12s]  This is new shit
[9599.12s -> 9601.84s]  Is this actually new shit or is this they just remade it for the switch?
[9602.64s -> 9610.08s]  I know monsters in a giant stampede
[9610.70s -> 9616.30s]  They attack the village in a frenzied rage new. Okay, hold on. He knows why this happens
[9616.78s -> 9619.90s]  But it came close to wiping out our village last time
[9620.86s -> 9636.68s]  It was announced a while ago. That's still cool though
[9637.32s -> 9653.71s]  I've been training for this moment for our entire lot to protect kamara village
[9655.39s -> 9661.48s]  Okay
[9661.48s -> 9664.04s]  Come a lot of things coming out in march march is gonna be a big month
[9664.68s -> 9670.62s]  Play the demo cool. That's cool
[9670.70s -> 9672.48s]  Hmm. Hmm
[9672.48s -> 9675.58s]  That one looks kind of fun
[9675.58s -> 9681.74s]  All right over on twitch the next poll is for content creator of the year vote now for who you think is going to win
[9681.82s -> 9683.82s]  And we'll find out a little bit who wins that category
[9683.98s -> 9690.22s]  But next up he's one of our industry's great performers and he plays joel in the last of us here is troy baker
[9694.19s -> 9696.27s]  One day on the set of the last of us part one
[9696.99s -> 9699.55s]  Neil our writer and director asked me and ashley
[9700.19s -> 9704.68s]  What we would have been if we weren't actors. I thought about it for a second and replied that
[9705.40s -> 9707.40s]  I always imagined I would have been a singer
[9708.22s -> 9710.14s]  ashley just shrugged and
[9710.14s -> 9713.58s]  In her charming and off-handed way said dare you be so charming
[9714.54s -> 9720.32s]  Right, how dare you be the most charming handsome man of us into ellie and joel space
[9721.04s -> 9729.77s]  And music became major elements of their stories creating touching moments between them one of those moments now indelible in our memories
[9730.97s -> 9735.95s]  Incorporated neil's story as well. Are you making us all look bad not as a writer but as a father
[9737.02s -> 9740.46s]  It involved a song he would play and sing to his daughter every night
[9741.53s -> 9744.01s]  That song was pearl jams future days
[9745.29s -> 9750.09s]  One day neil asked if I was comfortable playing it in a scene. He was writing for the last of his part two
[9751.13s -> 9752.41s]  now I don't
[9752.41s -> 9753.61s]  Generally get nervous
[9753.61s -> 9761.13s]  But I understood what that song meant to neil and to the game and the truth is neil can play that song better than me
[9761.37s -> 9771.58s]  But nobody can play it better than the person that wrote it from seattle performing future days. Here's eddie vetter. This is okay
[9775.13s -> 9777.13s]  Hey, this is just like a song
[9782.72s -> 9798.17s]  And sometimes you succeed to make this man of me
[9798.89s -> 9801.93s]  Somebody just said is this the guy from the weird owl song?
[9804.22s -> 9806.40s]  I am way older than you
[9807.44s -> 9809.44s]  This are you serious?
[9809.52s -> 9811.52s]  That's how you know him
[9813.08s -> 9815.48s]  No, dude, what the fuck?
[9817.48s -> 9819.84s]  Come on
[9819.84s -> 9821.84s]  All right, i'm just gonna quiet
[9821.92s -> 9833.24s]  Earl jam is almost 40 years old. That's insane to think about
[9846.84s -> 9848.84s]  I'm 18. Who is this guy?
[9852.97s -> 9856.89s]  Start asking for prime why because there's a lot of people here
[9860.01s -> 9862.59s]  No, don't stop to this channel, what are you nuts
[9866.17s -> 9868.17s]  Break 20k. Hey everybody
[9869.13s -> 9876.17s]  I don't even have notifications. Anyway, so I don't even know I can't even tell
[9878.33s -> 9886.20s]  I said it somebody got me to say
[9886.78s -> 9891.02s]  But i'm not saying anything. I'm not i'm not doing any notifications. Nothing
[9892.22s -> 9894.22s]  Thank you for the subs. I appreciate but I ain't saying anything
[9895.10s -> 9897.28s]  Not during the game award
[9903.36s -> 9905.36s]  Start talking about crime
[9909.76s -> 9914.08s]  Do people do that I feel like that's so obvious and so it's like stupid
[9921.93s -> 9928.14s]  Like i'm i'm not on the game awards
[9929.66s -> 9932.16s]  Guys i'm probably on a band list somewhere
[9943.50s -> 9947.08s]  You're a brand risk
[9947.32s -> 9949.32s]  I don't think i'm am I?
[9949.64s -> 9951.64s]  I don't think i'm a brand risk
[9953.77s -> 9955.13s]  Could I no
[9955.13s -> 9961.48s]  I mean I did show like me and chuckie cheese kissing on stream, right? But like that's
[9962.20s -> 9964.20s]  Whatever that a brand risk
[9964.60s -> 9974.46s]  With dump truck ass, whatever
[9975.02s -> 9982.06s]  He's a powerful rat
[9983.98s -> 9988.06s]  All right, so that was the song future days and um
[9988.78s -> 9991.26s]  that that song you might recognize from
[9991.98s -> 9997.98s]  From the last of us and I really appreciate the way that was that was used
[9999.18s -> 10000.70s]  especially bringing
[10000.70s -> 10002.70s]  Joel and ellie together
[10003.82s -> 10005.82s]  connecting through music
[10006.22s -> 10008.94s]  And I and I thought maybe it was cool too that made you
[10009.98s -> 10012.54s]  want to perhaps pick up a guitar
[10013.82s -> 10016.62s]  Yourself and and write a song for your loved one
[10017.58s -> 10020.01s]  um, but uh
[10020.25s -> 10022.25s]  It is nice to be part of this
[10022.49s -> 10026.17s]  Uh show my appreciation and be part of this year game awards

[10072.72s -> 10074.72s]  You already very interested
[10102.99s -> 10110.35s]  What the hell is going on here been helsing
[10110.51s -> 10122.78s]  Evil west
[10131.63s -> 10135.95s]  That was the exact same font the exact same text just missing a couple evil dead
[10136.83s -> 10138.93s]  That's kind of odd
[10138.93s -> 10141.01s]  There you go evil west. All right on twitch
[10141.01s -> 10146.29s]  We asked you to predict the winners in content creator of the year and the twitch audience
[10146.93s -> 10151.17s]  Uh said valkyrie with uh, 44 percent of the vote they think is gonna win
[10151.25s -> 10156.77s]  So the award for content creator of the year is coming up next presented by artist boss logic
[10157.09s -> 10160.85s]  Use adobe creative cloud to create tributes to the nominees. You'll see those in a minute
[10161.17s -> 10163.89s]  We've also got announcements from among us and fortnight
[10164.13s -> 10169.25s]  But right now scarlet nexus is an upcoming action jrpg from bandai namco
[10169.33s -> 10174.45s]  Here's a look at the brand new let's check the hairline. We gotta check it every now and again. How's it doing?
[10176.22s -> 10177.90s]  It's okay
[10177.90s -> 10181.10s]  It's okay virtual brain link cable and now it's all right
[10181.18s -> 10185.26s]  It's it'll be all right for a little bit of 10 years more than I did in training be strong
[10191.07s -> 10205.47s]  Seems like you're okay
[10205.47s -> 10210.56s]  new recruit
[10210.56s -> 10212.24s]  mysterious scum
[10212.24s -> 10221.34s]  About last year's theme was constant conflict
[10222.46s -> 10224.94s]  This year's theme is constant particle effects
[10225.66s -> 10243.20s]  The resisting I will obtain the red strings
[10244.24s -> 10250.16s]  Yeah, this has pushed the hardware to 98 CPU usage 100 percent of the time you play
[10266.99s -> 10269.73s]  Change the title
[10269.73s -> 10272.62s]  I didn't see elden ring yet
[10272.62s -> 10281.79s]  I didn't see it didn't happen. We're waiting for elden ring on the all-new xbox. I did not miss it
[10281.87s -> 10283.87s]  It's coming up soon. It's gonna be a huge deal
[10284.03s -> 10286.99s]  I am often depressed when I look at the status
[10287.47s -> 10292.37s]  Of where we are in terms of depression and anxiety and inattention
[10292.83s -> 10298.43s]  We owe it to all the people that are suffering to be really creative and to try things that when you first hear it
[10298.59s -> 10305.65s]  You missed it. I didn't miss it. It's coming medicine. It's gonna be a huge reveal. I am a neuroscientist and a neurologist
[10306.51s -> 10308.51s]  It started for me 12 years ago
[10309.15s -> 10311.47s]  I became really interested in this idea of creating
[10312.25s -> 10316.93s]  Experiences as a way of improving brain function and this relies on a principle called neuroplasticity
[10317.63s -> 10322.03s]  The fact that our brain reshapes itself and modifies itself in response to challenges
[10322.59s -> 10325.79s]  And so that's how it all started for me to create a video game
[10326.19s -> 10330.59s]  That was carefully designed to challenge and reward the brain in a very specific way
[10331.47s -> 10333.63s]  And so it just happened a couple months ago
[10333.63s -> 10340.85s]  The fda cleared endeavor rx as a medical device to treat inattention in children that have adhd
[10341.47s -> 10346.83s]  This is the first time ever that the fda has cleared a video game for any medical condition
[10347.15s -> 10353.15s]  So what we're talking about right now is to have a video game prescribed just like we prescribe pills for conditions
[10353.63s -> 10356.03s]  And think about this as a new type of medicine
[10361.15s -> 10363.15s]  The world is a dangerous place
[10363.15s -> 10365.15s]  This
[10365.31s -> 10367.39s]  Only the best can keep it safe
[10368.75s -> 10370.75s]  Become a tier one operative
[10372.11s -> 10373.63s]  plan
[10373.63s -> 10376.42s]  position
[10376.42s -> 10378.42s]  And execute
[10378.82s -> 10383.26s]  Fuck the face cam. It's not on
[10384.30s -> 10387.98s]  It's not on man join the elite bring the thunder
[10388.78s -> 10395.55s]  Thunder tier one as gamers you are just generally better humans and the world needs you
[10396.27s -> 10401.55s]  Here at the peak humanity procreation facility gamers from around the globe are donating their superior dna
[10402.27s -> 10406.99s]  I'm donating i'm donating what I have powerful swim swims and it can be yours

[10422.10s -> 10424.50s]  That was like uncomfortably long at the very end there
[10425.54s -> 10444.29s]  Come on, are you gonna donate your gamer poop?
[10444.69s -> 10455.22s]  I read that wrong

[10464.67s -> 10466.67s]  That's tomorrow. That's what we see tomorrow
[10482.26s -> 10484.26s]  There's the brand risk
[10484.26s -> 10485.78s]  whatever

[12235.62s -> 12240.90s]  How players agency and choice intersect with more traditional storytelling methods. It's uh,
