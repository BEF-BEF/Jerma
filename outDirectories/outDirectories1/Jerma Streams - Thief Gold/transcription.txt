[4.98s -> 8.25s]  How you doing? What's happening?
[9.05s -> 11.69s]  I cleared my throat right before talking to you, and that's the worst.
[12.41s -> 15.16s]  You know anything you're just ready to talk?
[15.16s -> 18.26s]  This happens sometimes when I answer a phone call too.
[20.12s -> 23.80s]  Milk voice? Did you say milk voice? What the hell? That's weird.
[25.10s -> 29.42s]  I know exactly what that means. I don't even like drink milk anymore. I don't even like milk.
[30.22s -> 31.74s]  That is weird.
[31.74s -> 37.06s]  All right. Anyways, right before you answer a phone call, you go...
[41.14s -> 43.78s]  Don't ring me for salt. Don't ring me for salt.
[47.46s -> 49.46s]  Hello? And then you answer and say that.
[53.58s -> 56.46s]  You get like prepared, and then you answer the phone call.
[56.46s -> 58.78s]  But after that, it sucks when you do all that.
[59.42s -> 61.82s]  So your phone starts ringing, and you go...
[64.14s -> 66.14s]  You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this.
[66.14s -> 67.74s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[67.74s -> 68.54s]  Hello? Hello?
[69.42s -> 70.46s]  I hate it. It's the worst.
[77.40s -> 78.36s]  Next game? What?
[78.36s -> 78.86s]  What?
[88.78s -> 92.14s]  I'm just fucking around. Why does everybody take everything I say so seriously?
[93.21s -> 95.21s]  You know what I mean? Why are you so serious, Batman?
[96.78s -> 99.02s]  I'm fucked up today. I'm in a really weird mood.
[101.86s -> 104.50s]  And I think the reason why I'm in such a weird mood today is because
[106.02s -> 112.26s]  there's a whole hands worth of olives sitting next to me, and I'm gonna put them on my fingers, I guess.
[113.66s -> 119.78s]  As I was buying the olives, and as I was walking around, and as I was getting prepared for the stream,
[121.46s -> 125.26s]  every five to six minutes, I'd say,
[126.06s -> 129.82s]  who am I doing this for? It's not for me.
[130.62s -> 134.87s]  Because I don't care, right? I like don't care about putting olives on my fingers.
[136.98s -> 142.50s]  It's one person said this. One person.
[143.06s -> 146.34s]  Why do I do this? I don't even... Why do I do this?
[149.14s -> 151.54s]  I don't care either. I don't know why. I don't know. Yeah, exactly.
[151.54s -> 155.46s]  Does anybody here actually want to see this? I don't think anybody cares.
[161.85s -> 162.89s]  But we're doing it anyways.
[167.29s -> 169.85s]  And I'm not going to do it till there's at least 10,000 people here.
[171.18s -> 174.86s]  I know. I'm like, what a psycho. An egomaniac.
[175.58s -> 179.93s]  No, I'm not going to eat olives off my fingers unless there's 10,000 people here watching.
[187.88s -> 193.38s]  Anyways, today, probably saw the title. I'm going to play Thief Gold.
[194.10s -> 198.79s]  Give you a short story here. Thief Gold has been installed.
[198.79s -> 200.95s]  Well, not installed. It's been purchased.
[201.91s -> 205.51s]  And in my, you should stream this list.
[206.47s -> 208.63s]  Uh, for probably three or four years.
[210.52s -> 214.68s]  Since I was back in Massachusetts, I just kind of looked at it today.
[214.68s -> 216.84s]  I was like, fine, I'll put it on the poll. Why not?
[217.72s -> 226.15s]  And it won. So, uh, this is the GOG version.
[226.15s -> 227.75s]  Yes, this is not the Steam version.
[228.39s -> 234.62s]  This is somebody said, do you collect trinkets around your house pretending to be a goblin,
[234.62s -> 238.87s]  laughing as you throw them into a sack? Why would I do that in my own house?
[240.36s -> 243.88s]  No, in your house is where you start counting the things you took.
[244.52s -> 247.82s]  I took the goblet. I took the treasure chest.
[247.82s -> 250.38s]  I took the gold coins. I don't put them back in the sack.
[250.38s -> 254.22s]  I count them. Why would I do that?
[254.22s -> 261.78s]  I've already put them in the sack. I took the urinal.
[264.81s -> 267.21s]  Uh, I took the urinal. Yeah.
[268.09s -> 273.50s]  What a shitty, that, what like, that sucks.
[274.55s -> 276.79s]  What am I going to do with that? What would I do with that?
[276.79s -> 287.16s]  That's just stupid. You converted it into a fan.
[287.72s -> 293.38s]  That thing's nice. In fact, thanks for reminding me.
[293.38s -> 297.03s]  I'm going to turn it on now. I'm turning my rotating urinal on
[297.03s -> 305.82s]  because I want some air. It's got a filtering.
[305.82s -> 310.90s]  Do you know that? This has got like an air filter
[310.90s -> 313.38s]  baked into this, in the middle and inside of it.
[313.38s -> 316.50s]  And it sucks air in through the filter and then blows it off the top.
[316.50s -> 320.76s]  It's actually pretty cool. And there's no, there's no fan on it.
[320.76s -> 325.05s]  It's a fanless fan. Need an olive on stream.
[325.05s -> 327.21s]  I'm just, hold on. I just turned it on.
[331.58s -> 333.58s]  All right. So we're talking, you want like the,
[335.74s -> 337.98s]  hold on. I got to, I got to go on campus.
[338.70s -> 343.27s]  But you want, what you want is you want,
[343.27s -> 346.07s]  you talking about like, I get it on my hand and I go like,
[347.27s -> 351.02s]  right? That's what you want. Like one, two, three, four, five, right?
[351.02s -> 354.04s]  That's what you're looking for. I think that's what you want.
[354.04s -> 360.07s]  Can I even get these on? It's going to be hard.
[360.07s -> 367.37s]  We're moving on real quick from this too, by the way.
[367.93s -> 372.47s]  This is like, I'm not spending more than a minute on this.
[372.47s -> 374.39s]  I can't, how am I supposed to do it on both hands?
[374.95s -> 381.11s]  I just broke one. Fucking hit the goddamn ground
[381.11s -> 382.87s]  and it's your fault. You did this to me.
[383.96s -> 386.84s]  All right. Look, my fingers.
[389.96s -> 394.94s]  I, it hit the ground. I can't, these ones have like pimento in them.
[395.58s -> 402.95s]  I can't put these on my finger. I mean, I can.
[409.24s -> 414.39s]  I don't care. Is that the one that hit the ground?
[414.39s -> 417.66s]  I got the wrong olives. I don't know anything about olives.
[417.66s -> 419.10s]  What do you think I know? Anything about olives?
[419.10s -> 420.54s]  Why would I know anything about olives?
[420.54s -> 422.06s]  Why would I know anything about olives?
[425.88s -> 427.56s]  Why would I know anything about olives?
[427.56s -> 431.10s]  Hey dude, you got the wrong olives. Oh yeah. Oh, sorry.
[431.10s -> 434.22s]  There's like fucking 40 cases at the grocery store.
[437.83s -> 440.39s]  I can't get them on all my fingers. You can just Photoshop it.
[440.39s -> 446.06s]  Here, look. I got the wrong olives.
[446.06s -> 453.32s]  Ego, ready? Like, oh, that looks gross.
[453.32s -> 460.07s]  Oh, okay. What is pimento?
[460.07s -> 465.51s]  Your hand's too big or they're too small? I don't know.
[465.51s -> 467.19s]  They're just olives. I just got like olives.
[467.19s -> 470.20s]  I didn't know. This is this black olives.
[470.20s -> 473.48s]  This is green olives. Black olives are like cut into rings sometimes.
[473.48s -> 476.92s]  Is that what you meant? I just bought olives at the grocery store.
[476.92s -> 487.62s]  I don't know. I got one. I got two on my fingers.
[488.26s -> 492.84s]  What the fuck is he doing? I don't, I, you know, and that's exactly why we're done.
[493.40s -> 498.95s]  I just used one of my dog wipes. These are actually dog wipes.
[498.95s -> 501.27s]  I'm not kidding. These are dog grooming wipes.
[503.61s -> 511.85s]  Like, wipe on his paws. No deal? I didn't even make a deal.
[511.85s -> 513.53s]  I don't even care if I don't have, what do you mean deal?
[513.53s -> 520.12s]  I don't care. I was just like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to put them on.
[520.12s -> 521.96s]  You got scammed? There was no scam. There's no deal.
[521.96s -> 524.12s]  I just, somebody said, put olives on your fingers and go like,
[524.12s -> 527.08s]  hoo hoo hoo at the screen. And I was like, okay, I guess I'll do it. Why?
[527.80s -> 539.38s]  Put an olive on each nostril. No, because that's fucking weird.
[540.10s -> 543.46s]  That's like, I don't know. I don't, no, not happening.
[544.10s -> 548.79s]  I don't even like olives. I like olive oil, but like olives are like a little too acidic.
[548.79s -> 553.99s]  You considered it? I did because it's stupid.
[553.99s -> 557.83s]  And, but like that's childish, right? It's childish.
[557.83s -> 564.06s]  It's, it's childish. It's what it is. It's, it's, it's like, oh, look at it.
[565.58s -> 567.42s]  It's like I got olives in my nose.
[567.42s -> 571.75s]  Clowns don't even do that at children's birthday parties.
[572.07s -> 574.95s]  Nobody should ever do that. No one should ever do something like that.
[577.22s -> 579.78s]  Sneeze out the olives. Yeah, that's just weird.
[579.78s -> 581.62s]  Why would somebody, why would anybody do that?
[581.62s -> 587.42s]  Anyways, we're going to play, there you go.
[587.42s -> 590.06s]  The one, for the one person that said put olives on your fingers and eat them.
[590.06s -> 599.69s]  I don't know what that was for, but there, yeah, I got the wrong olives.
[599.69s -> 602.66s]  A scam? I mean, maybe I'll put it on for a little bit,
[602.66s -> 604.34s]  but I got to move it though. It's in the wrong spot.
[605.27s -> 607.67s]  Actually, well, who cares? Doesn't matter.
[607.67s -> 611.46s]  Because I can crop it, but we're going to play thief.
[613.94s -> 619.48s]  Drop this here. That looks all right.
[620.12s -> 627.48s]  I don't, you know what? I don't like forward-facing face cam.
[627.48s -> 630.84s]  I feel like I'm in like an interview with you, right?
[630.84s -> 633.94s]  Oh, I feel like you're inside the monitor and it's weird.
[633.94s -> 637.22s]  I like an angle because it's like you're, you're like over here.
[637.22s -> 640.18s]  You're not just like literally staring in my eyes like here.
[640.18s -> 642.02s]  I don't know. I don't like forward-facing webcam.
[642.02s -> 646.36s]  All right. Well, whatever. We're going to move this out of the way.
[646.36s -> 652.38s]  I'm going to, let me just move the camera in case I want to use it for any reason.
[652.38s -> 660.81s]  I'm going to play thief, thief gold. It's the GOG version.
[660.81s -> 664.09s]  I don't know anything about this game. No, nothing at all.
[664.73s -> 668.01s]  Move the pair of underwear that's on the ground over here.
[668.01s -> 679.58s]  So you don't see it. I don't want you to see the underwear that I have on the ground.
[679.58s -> 682.65s]  Don't worry about it. Close my door.
[683.45s -> 687.82s]  All right. Let's go.
[689.40s -> 691.08s]  Why is there underwear in your office? I don't know.
[691.88s -> 696.22s]  Because I was probably like doing laundry or something.
[696.22s -> 706.46s]  All right. Is it in a good spot? Tell me. Not really.
[706.46s -> 708.94s]  Oh, should I have a ring light? I can turn, no, it hurts my eyes.
[708.94s -> 713.58s]  I don't want to use it. All right.
[713.58s -> 715.82s]  We got pretty much everybody's here. We can get going.
[715.82s -> 718.36s]  Thief gold. Make sure I'm comfortable.
[718.36s -> 720.76s]  I need to, no, you know what? I got to get, these olives are going to smell
[720.76s -> 722.44s]  and it's going to make me fucking gag.
[722.44s -> 730.84s]  Put the ring light around your neck.
[732.68s -> 737.64s]  If I put the ring light around my neck, I, it could actually fit.
[739.00s -> 740.44s]  That would be fucking stupid.
[742.50s -> 746.26s]  Oh, don't, don't stall this stream any more than it has to be.
[746.26s -> 748.58s]  Please let me just play thief.
[749.72s -> 752.68s]  That's so stupid. I think my, no, what if I get stuck?
[753.56s -> 756.36s]  What if I get stuck and I have to like go get it, go until I get it removed?
[759.35s -> 761.67s]  What if I get stuck? No, I might get stuck.
[761.67s -> 764.07s]  I think I could get it in there, but what if I, what if I can't get it out?
[764.07s -> 767.19s]  If I get stuck, I'm 36. Okay.
[768.07s -> 771.19s]  I can't make those mistakes anymore.
[771.19s -> 777.54s]  I can't put my head in a ring light and blame it on like, like, oh man, you know,
[777.54s -> 781.30s]  I, it's just, I was in college and we were drinking Bud Light and I was like,
[781.30s -> 783.86s]  yeah, you know, give me the ring light. I'll put it, I'm 36.
[783.86s -> 786.87s]  I'm an older man now. I can't do that.
[786.87s -> 791.67s]  I can't go to like the emergency room and like blame it on like the fucking Bud Reds
[791.67s -> 794.79s]  we were all drinking, like having a fun, just hanging out and like put it around.
[794.79s -> 801.11s]  No, no, no, I could, that's dangerous.
[801.11s -> 802.79s]  Just tell the nurse that you're famous.
[802.79s -> 806.30s]  What, who cares?
[806.30s -> 810.06s]  Oh yeah, see, I'm famous. That's why I put a ring light around my head and got stuck.
[810.06s -> 814.26s]  What does that, what does that have to do with anything?
[814.82s -> 819.30s]  Like the idiocy is still just the same as if I had one viewer or 10,000.
[819.30s -> 823.34s]  All right, let's go.
[823.34s -> 830.07s]  I'm imagining the drunk guy that just comes in.
[830.15s -> 834.81s]  Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I'm famous by the way.
[834.81s -> 835.45s]  Famous where?
[836.26s -> 837.86s]  Get out of my college dorm room.
[839.67s -> 842.23s]  It's the same. It's the same exact argument.
[842.23s -> 848.14s]  Yeah, they call, they call me fucking crazy, crazy Bill, pretty famous.
[851.58s -> 854.54s]  No, I'm not doing it. Maybe I'll see if I can put my head in there.
[855.18s -> 860.04s]  Not today though. On the next stream, if it's safe, I'll do it.
[861.10s -> 862.46s]  All right, turn this shit off.
[864.92s -> 866.76s]  All right, we're going to play thief.
[866.76s -> 867.50s]  Are you ready?
[868.06s -> 874.78s]  Oh, I'm famous.
[875.50s -> 877.56s]  Well, then you should, you should probably know better.
[878.20s -> 880.87s]  Like what you, you hold on.
[880.87s -> 884.07s]  You're telling me that you showed an audience of like 15,000 people.
[885.18s -> 886.54s]  Ha ha ha, look how funny it is.
[886.54s -> 887.98s]  I just got my head stuck in a light.
[888.70s -> 890.30s]  You should be way more responsible.
[890.30s -> 893.88s]  What are you talking about?
[893.88s -> 894.76s]  All right, we're gonna play thief.
[895.48s -> 898.10s]  I'll do face cam eventually, maybe in like 10 minutes.
[902.65s -> 903.93s]  How hard is this game? Is this game hard?
[904.49s -> 907.77s]  Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth.
[908.33s -> 909.48s]  Is this a hard game?
[913.50s -> 915.50s]  Yeah, if chat is good, I'll turn the face cam on.
[916.81s -> 917.69s]  Only if you're good though.
[917.69s -> 919.37s]  And you, I, I knew, and you better prove it.
[920.55s -> 921.99s]  Start training normal heart.
[921.99s -> 923.03s]  Not playing this on export.
[923.03s -> 924.07s]  I'm not playing it on hard either.
[924.95s -> 925.99s]  Not happening.
[925.99s -> 926.95s]  My arms are too high.
[927.67s -> 928.76s]  What's going on here?
[929.32s -> 933.38s]  I don't know. I need to be.
[934.02s -> 934.98s]  There we go.
[934.98s -> 936.12s]  I'm going to be higher than chair.
[936.12s -> 938.49s]  There it is. Okay.
[938.49s -> 939.61s]  All right, start training.
[939.61s -> 940.25s]  I don't know how to play.
[942.66s -> 943.54s]  I'm playing on normal.
[943.54s -> 944.50s]  I'm not playing on hard.
[945.30s -> 949.51s]  It's a boomer stealth game.
[949.51s -> 955.00s]  Oh God, the essence of balance is detachment.
[955.64s -> 960.82s]  To embrace a cause to grow fond or spiteful is to lose one's balance.
[964.79s -> 967.27s]  After which no action can be trusted.
[967.27s -> 973.50s]  A burden is not for the dependent of spirit.
[974.30s -> 978.06s]  I'm Maillard, third keeper.
[979.70s -> 980.58s]  I was a kid.
[981.14s -> 982.42s]  No parents, no home.
[983.22s -> 986.90s]  Running messages and picking pockets to keep my ribs from meeting my spine.
[987.86s -> 989.06s]  One night I saw a man.
[989.62s -> 992.34s]  Folks just passed him by like he wasn't there.
[992.42s -> 994.10s]  I thought he must have something valuable.
[994.10s -> 996.18s]  So I snuck up on him and made a grab.
[1000.62s -> 1001.66s]  That's not for you.
[1002.38s -> 1003.82s]  Please sir, I'm hungry.
[1003.82s -> 1004.78s]  Don't tell the hammers.
[1004.78s -> 1005.42s]  I promise.
[1005.42s -> 1007.10s]  What is your name, boy?
[1007.90s -> 1008.70s]  Garrett.
[1008.70s -> 1010.54s]  You have talent lad.
[1010.54s -> 1012.46s]  Let go of me old man.
[1012.46s -> 1014.54s]  To see a keeper is not an easy thing.
[1015.34s -> 1017.90s]  Especially one who does not wish to be seen.
[1018.94s -> 1021.58s]  We have a need for those as gifted as yourself.
[1022.22s -> 1027.26s]  If you've grown tired of how you live then follow me and we will show you a different way.
[1027.26s -> 1030.94s]  It's worth paying for a young actor to do this.
[1030.94s -> 1033.98s]  I caught up with him just before he vanished into the crowd.
[1033.98s -> 1037.26s]  It was the beginning of a very long education.
[1037.26s -> 1039.02s]  This is always the problem I have with audiobooks too.
[1039.58s -> 1042.62s]  I like I don't reading I don't reading is fine, right?
[1042.62s -> 1044.78s]  You can kind of make up your own voices and stuff.
[1044.78s -> 1050.76s]  But anytime you listen to an audiobook and the it's usually just one person
[1050.76s -> 1055.00s]  who reads the whole book and they'll typically do voices for everybody.
[1055.00s -> 1059.18s]  And it's usually like if they get to like a young character
[1059.74s -> 1062.94s]  or a higher character with a much higher pitched voice that they think.
[1063.98s -> 1066.30s]  And when they have a conversation with themselves it's always funny.
[1066.30s -> 1068.94s]  It's like I didn't want to do that.
[1068.94s -> 1070.14s]  I didn't want to go there.
[1070.94s -> 1074.70s]  Well you you had to at school is very important.
[1074.70s -> 1079.02s]  As she said leaning down it's always kind of feels off somehow.
[1079.02s -> 1081.21s]  But that can almost add to the charm in a way.
[1084.62s -> 1088.22s]  But I like to make up my own voices in my head when they when they do it.
[1088.22s -> 1089.02s]  That's literally you.
[1089.02s -> 1090.76s]  That's what I'm saying.
[1090.76s -> 1093.16s]  All right normal follow the directions of your instructor
[1093.16s -> 1094.76s]  in order to pass the training tests.
[1095.56s -> 1098.84s]  I use your last chance to make it not normie.
[1098.84s -> 1107.03s]  Instruct you in the various skills you will need to survive.
[1107.67s -> 1111.83s]  Please stay in the entrance area to each room while I explain the room's purpose.
[1111.83s -> 1115.99s]  When you are ready to begin your lessons proceed down this hallway to the first room.
[1117.62s -> 1118.26s]  Who's walking?
[1119.06s -> 1119.94s]  What if I'm not ready?
[1122.95s -> 1123.67s]  Are those health?
[1124.87s -> 1126.55s]  Why do I have like little health icons?
[1127.35s -> 1128.23s]  Um hold on a minute.
[1128.23s -> 1129.03s]  This is freaking me out.
[1129.03s -> 1129.83s]  What are these controls?
[1131.13s -> 1133.69s]  Wait wait wait wait what's happening?
[1133.69s -> 1134.17s]  I'm gonna puke.
[1135.77s -> 1138.17s]  Okay A and S is not strafe.
[1138.81s -> 1139.93s]  It's look left and right.
[1140.89s -> 1143.29s]  W and W is walk forward.
[1144.26s -> 1145.22s]  What's going on here?
[1147.40s -> 1149.48s]  Holding S walks me forward.
[1150.76s -> 1151.88s]  It's tank controls?
[1151.88s -> 1152.44s]  No it's not.
[1155.26s -> 1156.38s]  I need to rebind the keys.
[1161.91s -> 1162.79s]  Forward.
[1162.79s -> 1164.23s]  W walk forward.
[1165.32s -> 1165.64s]  Shift?
[1168.50s -> 1169.06s]  Is it shift?
[1170.49s -> 1171.85s]  Backwards is X.
[1171.85s -> 1173.05s]  Oh my goodness.
[1173.05s -> 1174.17s]  X no S.
[1175.56s -> 1176.44s]  Backwards S.

[1195.98s -> 1197.74s]  Okay turn left is fine.
[1197.74s -> 1198.62s]  That can be keyboard.
[1198.62s -> 1201.10s]  Turn right look up page center.

[1253.58s -> 1259.00s]  Free look I don't know like this thing.
[1259.00s -> 1260.92s]  Next item can I do scroll?
[1260.92s -> 1262.84s]  Oh okay I can wait.
[1262.84s -> 1263.72s]  Should I even do that though?
[1263.72s -> 1266.49s]  Previous item scroll a little up.
[1266.49s -> 1269.82s]  Clear item backspace next weapon.
[1269.82s -> 1271.50s]  Previous weapon oh I don't care.

[1313.69s -> 1317.94s]  Gamma plus lean forward W alt shift quick save.
[1317.94s -> 1320.20s]  All right we know what quick save is.
[1320.20s -> 1321.56s]  Take a screenshot.
[1321.56s -> 1324.20s]  Increase main volume decrease volume.
[1324.20s -> 1327.11s]  I'm just gonna play.
[1327.11s -> 1336.95s]  Okay at least like the basic controls are fine.
[1336.95s -> 1343.18s]  You must learn.
[1343.18s -> 1347.14s]  Okay I'll just see.
[1347.14s -> 1349.94s]  The indicator on your screen will tell you how visible you are.
[1349.94s -> 1353.67s]  Reach the top of the platform scene.
[1353.67s -> 1355.03s]  Okay top of the platform.
[1355.03s -> 1355.99s]  Where's the top of the platform?
[1355.99s -> 1357.27s]  So just don't be seen by this guy.
[1357.27s -> 1358.15s]  I see you there lad.
[1358.15s -> 1359.43s]  He's literally facing the other way.
[1359.43s -> 1361.27s]  What his head is facing the door.
[1362.07s -> 1364.10s]  I see you then.
[1364.10s -> 1364.98s]  He's not even looking this way.
[1364.98s -> 1365.78s]  He's looking at the door.
[1366.58s -> 1373.53s]  He's literally facing the other direction.
[1373.53s -> 1378.22s]  But just because I'm in the shade he can't see me.
[1381.59s -> 1383.19s]  Oh he's not he's looking this way.
[1383.19s -> 1384.79s]  All right so get to the top of the platform.
[1384.79s -> 1385.83s]  So I gotta get behind him.
[1389.14s -> 1389.70s]  Well done.
[1390.26s -> 1391.62s]  I did not see you approach.
[1392.26s -> 1393.86s]  Open this door to continue.
[1393.86s -> 1394.10s]  What?
[1394.10s -> 1397.38s]  When the door is near the center of your screen it will light up.
[1397.38s -> 1399.30s]  Indicating that it is selected.
[1399.30s -> 1399.62s]  Okay.
[1399.62s -> 1402.98s]  To manipulate selected doors and other objects use them.
[1405.32s -> 1405.96s]  That's bad.
[1405.96s -> 1407.16s]  Mouse three to use.
[1407.16s -> 1408.12s]  What a dumb idea.
[1408.12s -> 1411.08s]  Proceed down this corridor for your next test.
[1411.08s -> 1411.88s]  Are you sprint?
[1411.88s -> 1413.24s]  You can check your map at any time.
[1414.22s -> 1415.02s]  Does the show where?
[1415.02s -> 1416.46s]  Oh no please.
[1416.46s -> 1417.34s]  No no no no no.
[1418.41s -> 1420.49s]  It doesn't give you like a you are here in the mall.
[1421.13s -> 1422.01s]  Oh this is bad.
[1422.01s -> 1422.89s]  I guess I'm right here.
[1423.45s -> 1429.43s]  You must learn to move.
[1429.43s -> 1431.93s]  Some surfaces are louder than others when walked upon.
[1431.93s -> 1434.41s]  And moving quickly makes more noise than moving slowly.
[1434.41s -> 1435.77s]  Okay don't walk on like the glass.
[1435.77s -> 1438.57s]  Listen to your own footsteps to hear how much noise you are making.
[1439.05s -> 1440.97s]  The instructor will have his back turn.
[1440.97s -> 1444.41s]  You must get to the top of the platform without being heard.
[1444.41s -> 1445.85s]  Isn't he the instructor?
[1446.65s -> 1448.39s]  All right so just don't step on that.
[1448.39s -> 1449.27s]  That probably makes noise.
[1456.17s -> 1456.73s]  Do you didn't hear me?
[1459.16s -> 1459.72s]  Very good.
[1460.36s -> 1462.12s]  I did not hear you traverse the room.
[1463.24s -> 1466.28s]  Grab him by his top of his head and bottom of his head and just twist.
[1466.28s -> 1467.88s]  That will lead you to your next task.
[1468.60s -> 1480.66s]  What?
[1480.66s -> 1483.86s]  They're gonna teach me how to kill people like whoa.
[1483.86s -> 1488.34s]  To pick up objects select them by centering them on screen until they light up.
[1488.74s -> 1489.30s]  I got a weapon.
[1489.30s -> 1489.78s]  Then use them.
[1489.78s -> 1491.30s]  Choose your weapon now.
[1491.30s -> 1493.38s]  Try readying your sword and then your bow.
[1493.38s -> 1494.02s]  You can hold.
[1494.02s -> 1496.34s]  You can always put them away again if you need your hands free.
[1497.86s -> 1498.82s]  I feel like I'm in VR.
[1500.42s -> 1501.54s]  This is a VR moment.
[1502.57s -> 1503.05s]  Where is he?
[1503.61s -> 1504.33s]  I can't get him.
[1504.97s -> 1505.85s]  Oh he's over here.
[1506.65s -> 1507.21s]  Ow!
[1507.21s -> 1510.25s]  He didn't make the noise but you know.
[1511.56s -> 1512.20s]  Ready your bow.
[1512.76s -> 1516.12s]  Knock an arrow and draw back the string by holding down the attack button.
[1516.12s -> 1519.48s]  Make sure you draw all the way back or your shot will not have full power.
[1520.12s -> 1520.68s]  Take aim.
[1520.68s -> 1520.92s]  Nice.
[1520.92s -> 1523.56s]  When you are ready to shoot release your attack.
[1523.56s -> 1525.40s]  See if you can hit one of these targets.
[1526.36s -> 1529.16s]  That mouse sensitivity drops a lot.
[1529.96s -> 1533.75s]  Did I miss every shot?
[1533.75s -> 1534.31s]  What?
[1534.31s -> 1535.35s]  Wait a minute.
[1535.35s -> 1539.86s]  Did I miss every shot?
[1539.86s -> 1548.50s]  What's happening?
[1548.50s -> 1549.06s]  Turn around.
[1549.88s -> 1554.33s]  Oh good shot.
[1554.33s -> 1555.53s]  Keep practicing if you wish.
[1555.53s -> 1563.40s]  When you are ready to proceed approach the training dummy and ready your sword.
[1563.40s -> 1563.96s]  Head shot.
[1569.45s -> 1570.17s]  Ready your sword.
[1570.73s -> 1573.50s]  Swing at the target with the attack button.
[1573.50s -> 1575.58s]  A quick tap will give you a slash.
[1575.58s -> 1579.42s]  Move the tip of your sword to the left of the target for a left slash and to the right
[1579.42s -> 1580.86s]  of the target for a right slash.
[1581.82s -> 1582.06s]  Nice.
[1582.94s -> 1584.54s]  Then release for an overhead swing.
[1585.42s -> 1588.94s]  Try both slashes and the overhead swing on the practice dummy.
[1588.94s -> 1591.34s]  You can tell how good you're doing based on the cartoon sound effects.
[1591.34s -> 1592.54s]  Ready for a live opponent.
[1592.54s -> 1593.99s]  Practice against your partner.
[1593.99s -> 1596.87s]  Enter the cobbled sparring area.
[1596.87s -> 1599.91s]  The more it sounds like Scooby Doo the better you know you're doing.
[1599.91s -> 1602.38s]  You want to go?
[1602.38s -> 1603.82s]  Wait is this the trainer?
[1603.82s -> 1610.52s]  Hack him with your sword.
[1611.64s -> 1613.24s]  Wait did I just get disqualified?
[1619.83s -> 1621.43s]  His ears are ringing right now.
[1624.18s -> 1625.14s]  Oh I can block right?
[1627.10s -> 1627.34s]  Yep.
[1632.38s -> 1638.26s]  Oh we're not actually fighting.
[1640.63s -> 1642.07s]  It's right in the teeth.
[1642.07s -> 1642.71s]  Alright let's go.
[1644.60s -> 1645.24s]  Leave me alone.
[1645.24s -> 1646.68s]  That's enough sparring for today.
[1646.68s -> 1647.56s]  Well he's following me.
[1647.56s -> 1648.76s]  Let's walk over to the table.
[1648.76s -> 1649.96s]  He's literally following me.
[1649.96s -> 1650.60s]  Get away from me.
[1651.64s -> 1657.38s]  That was just like the me and my little brother were in a little bit of a fight
[1657.38s -> 1660.18s]  before we came to dinner and we just got called to dinner and I was like
[1660.18s -> 1660.98s]  I gotta get one more.
[1662.74s -> 1663.70s]  Coming mom.
[1663.78s -> 1674.31s]  Shut up idiot.
[1674.31s -> 1676.28s]  Okay so now what?
[1676.28s -> 1677.64s]  Why are you following me around?
[1677.64s -> 1680.30s]  How do we open this?
[1680.30s -> 1680.78s]  Open this.
[1686.38s -> 1687.34s]  Open the door.
[1687.34s -> 1688.84s]  Go to the table?
[1698.25s -> 1698.81s]  What table?
[1699.37s -> 1703.99s]  Would you care for some refreshment before you move on young Garret?
[1704.73s -> 1704.97s]  Apple.
[1704.97s -> 1707.13s]  Please pick up all of the items on this table.
[1707.13s -> 1710.65s]  Cycle through your inventory to see the objects you have in your pocket.
[1710.65s -> 1711.21s]  Apple.
[1711.21s -> 1711.93s]  Compass.
[1711.93s -> 1713.77s]  Once an object is displayed you may use it.
[1713.77s -> 1714.41s]  Healing potion.
[1714.41s -> 1714.57s]  Alright.
[1714.57s -> 1716.01s]  Have something to eat if you wish.
[1716.01s -> 1717.29s]  Then you may proceed.
[1717.29s -> 1720.49s]  The next test is waiting on the other side of the metal door.
[1720.49s -> 1720.81s]  Okay.
[1721.77s -> 1723.13s]  I have a compass too.
[1725.11s -> 1726.15s]  How do I use it?
[1726.15s -> 1726.87s]  Oh it's just up.
[1727.43s -> 1728.55s]  The door is locked.
[1728.55s -> 1730.31s]  But the key from the table will open it.
[1730.31s -> 1733.11s]  To unlock the door select the key in your inventory.
[1733.11s -> 1735.67s]  Center the door on screen until it lights up.
[1735.67s -> 1737.11s]  Then use the key on the door.
[1737.11s -> 1737.43s]  Good.
[1737.43s -> 1740.23s]  Now head down this hallway to get to your next test.
[1740.23s -> 1741.03s]  What's the next test?
[1742.97s -> 1744.09s]  Apples are nice.
[1744.09s -> 1746.41s]  Well only one kind of apple is worth eating in my opinion.
[1746.41s -> 1746.89s]  Well two.
[1748.38s -> 1750.54s]  Green or Macintosh.
[1750.54s -> 1751.58s]  The rest are dog shit.
[1752.62s -> 1754.86s]  First climb the rope by jumping onto it.
[1756.14s -> 1758.94s]  Move while looking up or down to climb up or down the rope.
[1758.94s -> 1759.66s]  So you can look up?
[1759.66s -> 1760.22s]  Turn to change your places.
[1760.22s -> 1761.42s]  Okay it's not S.
[1761.42s -> 1763.66s]  If you jump again you will release the rope.
[1763.66s -> 1766.06s]  Now climb the rope to get to the top of the platform.
[1766.06s -> 1766.70s]  Well done.
[1766.70s -> 1769.42s]  Run and jump across the gap to the other side of the stream.
[1769.98s -> 1771.18s]  I feel like I'm not running fast enough.
[1771.18s -> 1772.22s]  Is this how fast I can go?
[1772.22s -> 1772.54s]  Good jump.
[1774.66s -> 1777.62s]  This obstacle is easy to climb if you know how.
[1777.62s -> 1779.14s]  First move close to the wall.
[1779.86s -> 1783.30s]  Next jump to grab the edge of the wall and pull yourself up.
[1783.30s -> 1784.18s]  Good job.
[1784.18s -> 1786.10s]  I am most pleased with your progress.
[1786.90s -> 1788.02s]  I just breathed on it.
[1788.02s -> 1788.58s]  All right.
[1788.58s -> 1791.30s]  If you wish you may stay to practice your climbing and jumping.
[1791.30s -> 1793.78s]  Or swimming, ducking, leaning or crawling.
[1793.78s -> 1795.14s]  Okay this ball damaged.
[1795.14s -> 1797.94s]  You may return to your chambers by going through that red door.
[1798.74s -> 1799.24s]  Farewell.
[1800.02s -> 1801.42s]  Okay so it's jump.
[1803.03s -> 1803.43s]  Let go.
[1804.15s -> 1807.91s]  All right let's do it.
[1808.55s -> 1815.43s]  The keepers were training me to be one of them.
[1816.87s -> 1817.27s]  Mushroom.
[1817.27s -> 1818.31s]  Other uses for those.
[1818.31s -> 1819.35s]  Oh shit mushroom.
[1819.35s -> 1819.67s]  Eat it.
[1820.23s -> 1821.58s]  What is that?
[1821.58s -> 1822.62s]  What happened?
[1822.62s -> 1826.55s]  Wait what what wait no I wanted to explore.
[1830.84s -> 1839.40s]  All right so now I'm an expert thief.
[1840.12s -> 1848.63s]  You didn't explore don't need to explore the tutorial.
[1848.63s -> 1850.39s]  Well I just wanted to see I was just curious.
[1857.05s -> 1858.33s]  Where are my parents?
[1858.33s -> 1859.29s]  I don't know.
[1859.29s -> 1862.74s]  The most promising acolyte left us.
[1862.74s -> 1869.72s]  Not out of the lesser folly of sentiment but the greater folly of anger.
[1870.52s -> 1876.74s]  His heart was clouded and his balance was lost but his abilities were unmatched.
[1879.26s -> 1882.78s]  Even then we knew to match watch him most carefully.
[1884.36s -> 1885.24s]  Keeper.
[1885.24s -> 1886.12s]  Annals.
[1886.12s -> 1893.21s]  Stealing is wrong.
[1894.81s -> 1896.89s]  I have a simple job planned for this evening.
[1897.45s -> 1898.81s]  Break into a guarded mansion.
[1898.81s -> 1899.45s]  Break into a mansion.
[1899.45s -> 1901.77s]  Steal another fat nobleman's priceless trinket.
[1901.77s -> 1903.69s]  Steal a trinket and leave quietly.
[1903.69s -> 1907.93s]  Lord Bafford is out of town and rumor has it that the captain of his house guard went
[1907.93s -> 1909.37s]  with him as a bodyguard.
[1910.33s -> 1912.73s]  The time is ripe for a bit of burglary.
[1913.85s -> 1914.17s]  All right.
[1914.97s -> 1921.72s]  The front gate of Lord Bafford's manor is always guarded and the main street is far to expose.
[1921.72s -> 1923.08s]  Sounds like the guy in Hitman 3.
[1924.04s -> 1924.52s]  The constant.
[1936.28s -> 1937.08s]  Miss Burnwood.
[1948.12s -> 1948.52s]  Up floor.
[1952.04s -> 1953.64s]  All I need is to give you two bricks.
[1954.60s -> 1955.66s]  Give me two bricks.
[1956.62s -> 1958.06s]  An extra large heel.
[1961.85s -> 1963.13s]  And a fucking ski mask.
[1964.73s -> 1965.91s]  I'll get what you need.
[1965.91s -> 1967.67s]  I'll get up there and get that trinket.
[1967.67s -> 1978.86s]  Sneak into Lord Bafford's manor and case the place.
[1980.54s -> 1984.78s]  Well house in back is your best bet if you can get the key from the guard.
[1984.78s -> 1987.50s]  Lackjacking or pickpocketing him would be quietest.
[1988.14s -> 1993.43s]  Find the prized scepter and redistribute it to yourself.
[1994.55s -> 1998.60s]  Try to do it without causing too much commotion.
[1999.32s -> 2006.49s]  All right so I gotta get into the manor.
[2007.64s -> 2009.32s]  There's a well house out the back.
[2009.32s -> 2012.84s]  I can get the key from the guard or just all right I gotta get in there.
[2013.56s -> 2016.30s]  Starting gear.
[2017.11s -> 2021.43s]  I got a blackjack, a sword, an archery healing potion, water arrow.
[2022.38s -> 2026.22s]  Water arrow does not do any damage but it douses torches and other burning.
[2026.22s -> 2027.82s]  Okay that's really important.
[2027.82s -> 2030.14s]  What is blackjack?
[2030.14s -> 2033.42s]  This weapon will knock out an unsuspecting target with little noise and no blood.
[2033.42s -> 2033.98s]  Oh okay.
[2034.62s -> 2038.04s]  All right let's go.
[2038.76s -> 2041.46s]  Where am I?
[2043.98s -> 2044.62s]  Watch.
[2044.62s -> 2047.18s]  Okay watch for interior patrols.
[2047.18s -> 2048.38s]  There's the front entrance.
[2048.38s -> 2049.58s]  This is heavily guarded.
[2049.58s -> 2051.18s]  Do not try frontal assault.
[2052.10s -> 2054.90s]  Arrow cache pickup en route to the second floor.
[2055.62s -> 2056.34s]  One guard.
[2057.62s -> 2058.98s]  This well leads to the basement.
[2058.98s -> 2059.78s]  Basement entrance.
[2060.50s -> 2062.26s]  Okay we're gonna try to go to the basement.
[2062.26s -> 2064.90s]  So I gotta go to the right here this way.
[2066.10s -> 2067.78s]  I drew this map I hope it helps.
[2067.78s -> 2070.18s]  Is it illegal for me to like be right here?
[2070.18s -> 2073.58s]  No I haven't done anything illegal.
[2074.86s -> 2076.38s]  All right I haven't done anything illegal though.
[2076.38s -> 2077.42s]  So like it's okay that I.
[2078.14s -> 2081.24s]  All right so that's the front door.
[2083.19s -> 2083.91s]  Go in the front.
[2087.74s -> 2088.46s]  It's three guards.
[2088.46s -> 2090.22s]  I don't think let me try let me see if let me go to the well.
[2090.86s -> 2097.06s]  It's a well out back.
[2097.62s -> 2099.27s]  There's a cheese factory.
[2099.91s -> 2101.88s]  I can't go in there.
[2101.88s -> 2103.64s]  All right here's the here's the underground well.
[2111.42s -> 2112.86s]  You can't fight all these people at once.
[2112.86s -> 2114.46s]  I mean I can but it's probably bad.
[2115.10s -> 2117.30s]  All right where am I at?
[2117.30s -> 2119.42s]  There's one guard.
[2119.42s -> 2120.30s]  I'm okay here's the well.
[2120.30s -> 2121.58s]  That's where I am right now.
[2121.58s -> 2124.92s]  So there's a guard here.
[2124.92s -> 2125.72s]  Basement entrance.
[2125.72s -> 2127.32s]  The well leads to the basement waterway.
[2127.32s -> 2128.44s]  Basement waterway.
[2128.44s -> 2128.92s]  I got it.
[2128.92s -> 2129.96s]  All right cool.
[2129.96s -> 2132.26s]  I have to save the game.
[2132.82s -> 2136.65s]  Well that would have been a fucking disaster.
[2137.21s -> 2140.87s]  Where's the uh blackjack?
[2140.87s -> 2141.99s]  All right I can so this thing.
[2143.24s -> 2145.64s]  Or this thing you just whack somebody's head.
[2145.64s -> 2148.42s]  All right this will go up to the basement.
[2148.42s -> 2149.91s]  Is anybody here?
[2149.91s -> 2157.96s]  This doesn't look like a basement.
[2157.96s -> 2169.54s]  What's this way?
[2169.54s -> 2170.98s]  Oh okay this is where I am right now.
[2170.98s -> 2172.34s]  So I'm underground.
[2172.34s -> 2172.90s]  Keep going.
[2173.54s -> 2174.74s]  Thank god it tells you where you are.
[2175.46s -> 2180.44s]  Okay basement.
[2180.44s -> 2194.49s]  There's a door.
[2195.05s -> 2197.18s]  Oh shit hold on.
[2201.21s -> 2202.49s]  God damn it give me a break.
[2203.05s -> 2206.60s]  Can I get in this door?
[2207.32s -> 2211.14s]  All right stealth stealth stealth stealth stealth.
[2213.13s -> 2214.09s]  Somebody's coming somebody's coming.
[2215.72s -> 2218.12s]  Water water water water arrows water arrows.
[2220.54s -> 2221.18s]  Oh shit.
[2221.90s -> 2228.79s]  How many times do I have to shoot somebody in the head before they die?
[2228.79s -> 2233.29s]  What how do I move the body?
[2241.14s -> 2242.34s]  Oh my god all right dump them.
[2242.34s -> 2243.06s]  Dump them down here.
[2243.54s -> 2251.03s]  Okay I gotta get rid of the blood.
[2251.59s -> 2257.77s]  All right that's one guard.
[2257.77s -> 2259.50s]  All right save it.
[2259.50s -> 2269.72s]  F11 what's that?
[2269.72s -> 2270.92s]  What I can't go in here.
[2270.92s -> 2273.86s]  This I can't open this door.
[2273.86s -> 2275.30s]  I thought this is a place into the mansion.
[2277.30s -> 2277.78s]  Wait a minute.
[2277.78s -> 2280.42s]  I need to figure out how do I put the other arrows on.
[2280.42s -> 2284.73s]  How do I do it?
[2284.73s -> 2285.69s]  Who's in the options?
[2286.49s -> 2291.08s]  Okay water at four.
[2291.08s -> 2292.28s]  So I just have it up four.
[2292.84s -> 2293.32s]  There we go.
[2293.32s -> 2294.76s]  All right so what if I if I do this.
[2295.40s -> 2297.66s]  I just need to test this and see what happens.
[2297.66s -> 2299.51s]  I didn't do anything.
[2303.54s -> 2313.08s]  What what the?
[2313.08s -> 2314.52s]  No no I want to get points.
[2314.52s -> 2316.38s]  This guy's drunk.
[2316.38s -> 2318.06s]  All right wait what do I do about this guy?
[2318.06s -> 2324.42s]  Can you see me?
[2338.94s -> 2340.62s]  This is not very stealthy.
[2340.62s -> 2341.34s]  Where's he going?
[2345.69s -> 2346.81s]  Oh he's got the key.
[2346.81s -> 2347.45s]  He's got the key.
[2347.45s -> 2357.90s]  All right all right dump him.
[2357.90s -> 2358.46s]  All right I got it.
[2358.46s -> 2359.18s]  Did I take the key?
[2359.74s -> 2362.70s]  Close it.
[2362.70s -> 2363.82s]  Okay I was never here.
[2363.82s -> 2365.16s]  I got the key right?
[2365.16s -> 2368.92s]  Yep nice.
[2368.92s -> 2369.88s]  Hold down.
[2369.88s -> 2371.48s]  Yeah I can do like a big swing.
[2371.48s -> 2375.19s]  Can I take the beer?
[2375.19s -> 2375.67s]  I can.
[2375.67s -> 2376.47s]  Oh it's a bottle.
[2377.83s -> 2378.39s]  Don't do that.
[2378.39s -> 2379.03s]  I was trying to drink it.
[2379.03s -> 2379.51s]  I was trying to drink it.
[2379.51s -> 2380.15s]  I was trying to drink it.
[2380.15s -> 2381.35s]  Oh my goodness slow down.
[2381.91s -> 2385.85s]  I can't just pick it up.
[2385.85s -> 2393.93s]  How do I just okay drop.
[2394.89s -> 2395.69s]  That's so loud.
[2396.25s -> 2399.93s]  I think I'm in.
[2399.93s -> 2400.49s]  Oh here's the well.
[2400.49s -> 2401.93s]  All right let's bring this with us.
[2401.93s -> 2410.54s]  There's the well.
[2412.70s -> 2413.90s]  That was a tuber reaction.
[2414.46s -> 2417.16s]  It was genuine though.
[2417.16s -> 2418.68s]  All right so I have to go down the well.
[2419.32s -> 2421.37s]  Am I gonna get hurt?
[2421.37s -> 2431.61s]  All right so now I'm underneath the estate right?
[2431.61s -> 2434.65s]  This is all pre-recorded.
[2434.65s -> 2438.17s]  Now I'm just sitting back with my legs up on the desk.
[2438.73s -> 2441.69s]  My arms behind my head just relaxing while I watch this with you.
[2442.33s -> 2445.93s]  All right where am I at?
[2445.93s -> 2447.53s]  Basement is coming up here.
[2447.53s -> 2451.38s]  What's that?
[2451.94s -> 2454.28s]  Secret.
[2454.28s -> 2466.18s]  I don't know where I'm gonna end up.
[2466.18s -> 2467.70s]  Oh my god what is that thing?
[2467.70s -> 2469.62s]  Wait is this is that attack?
[2470.18s -> 2470.82s]  Is this evil?
[2470.82s -> 2471.46s]  Are these evil?
[2472.02s -> 2472.66s]  Do these attack?
[2473.46s -> 2477.38s]  I feel like do these attack?
[2477.94s -> 2480.58s]  I'm kind of I hate this.
[2484.60s -> 2485.40s]  Get out of the water.
[2486.68s -> 2488.20s]  Grab the edge and get out of the water.
[2488.20s -> 2489.48s]  Get out of the water.
[2489.48s -> 2490.20s]  Get out of the water.
[2492.49s -> 2494.73s]  Oh get back in the water get back in the water get back in the water back in the water.
[2509.38s -> 2510.66s]  All right I got it I got it.
[2510.66s -> 2511.30s]  I got one.
[2511.94s -> 2516.44s]  This is how I actually treat when there's a spider in the house.
[2522.55s -> 2525.67s]  Oh there's a chest over here.
[2525.67s -> 2532.58s]  Since I'm in here I'm gonna pick up something for myself.
[2532.58s -> 2533.38s]  There's nothing in here.
[2537.99s -> 2538.71s]  Waste of time.
[2543.67s -> 2543.99s]  What?
[2547.29s -> 2554.46s]  Okay well I got gold.
[2554.46s -> 2560.65s]  Oh swim come on.
[2560.65s -> 2566.89s]  Do you have a time limit?
[2566.89s -> 2568.33s]  I don't have a time limit.
[2568.33s -> 2571.78s]  And that person for a day.
[2573.69s -> 2574.65s]  Which way do I have to go?
[2574.65s -> 2575.53s]  I forget.
[2575.53s -> 2583.10s]  Do I have a face cam?
[2583.10s -> 2585.02s]  Yeah just I'll put it on in a minute.
[2585.02s -> 2589.43s]  Or maybe I won't.
[2589.43s -> 2590.97s]  I don't have to have face cam.
[2590.97s -> 2593.21s]  It's fun to use sometimes but you know whatever.
[2593.21s -> 2601.90s]  Okay I gotta be careful now.
[2602.54s -> 2604.14s]  Take out the uh take out the bludgeoner.
[2604.70s -> 2607.21s]  Wait are these explosive?
[2607.21s -> 2614.36s]  These are explosive I think.
[2614.36s -> 2616.12s]  Inside at last.
[2616.12s -> 2618.78s]  Are they the blow up?
[2619.34s -> 2624.22s]  Doesn't look like it.
[2627.35s -> 2633.03s]  Can I do anything with this stuff?
[2633.59s -> 2635.78s]  I'm making so much noise here.
[2635.78s -> 2636.66s]  Okay you know what?
[2636.66s -> 2637.94s]  This is actually good.
[2637.94s -> 2639.38s]  Because they're not going to investigate this.
[2639.38s -> 2641.14s]  Because they just probably assume a raccoon is in here.
[2642.26s -> 2651.42s]  All right we're gonna get upstairs.
[2665.34s -> 2665.74s]  Where are they?
[2668.23s -> 2668.55s]  Oops.
[2671.54s -> 2673.70s]  I was trying to hit him in the face in the box.
[2673.70s -> 2681.98s]  I can't go anywhere.
[2683.05s -> 2683.37s]  What?
[2687.02s -> 2688.62s]  No I just made a problem for myself.
[2688.62s -> 2690.30s]  I can't clip through those.
[2690.30s -> 2701.75s]  Go investigate that.
[2701.75s -> 2703.50s]  Wait opportunity.
[2703.50s -> 2704.30s]  I'll get this guy in the head.
[2718.50s -> 2719.30s]  I see you there.
[2725.40s -> 2725.72s]  Die.
[2731.38s -> 2732.50s]  Why won't he fight me?
[2736.20s -> 2737.00s]  Hurry up run.
[2739.37s -> 2740.17s]  God damn it.
[2740.17s -> 2741.13s]  I knew it was a problem.
[2743.93s -> 2745.53s]  I have to be off to this guy.
[2745.53s -> 2746.97s]  Before he brings the alarm.
[2751.02s -> 2756.92s]  Fuck come on.
[2756.92s -> 2758.44s]  Why is he so much faster than me?
[2759.08s -> 2764.95s]  I got him.
[2764.95s -> 2769.90s]  Wait there's so much stuff over here.
[2769.90s -> 2770.22s]  Hold on.
[2770.86s -> 2778.84s]  No I want the apple.
[2778.84s -> 2781.91s]  My health is okay.
[2783.37s -> 2784.57s]  Oh nice all right.
[2784.57s -> 2784.89s]  Money?
[2785.85s -> 2789.32s]  I gotta get these guys out of here.
[2789.88s -> 2792.41s]  What's that music for?
[2793.13s -> 2796.30s]  I'm so turned around though I don't even know where I was.
[2796.86s -> 2800.07s]  Was that a shovel?
[2800.63s -> 2802.17s]  Oh hell yeah.
[2805.05s -> 2806.50s]  Wait come here.
[2806.50s -> 2814.74s]  That means guards are coming?
[2814.74s -> 2819.16s]  Put him in the chest.
[2819.16s -> 2824.92s]  All right where am I?
[2824.92s -> 2836.17s]  I gotta get up from here.
[2836.17s -> 2836.49s]  Save.
[2836.49s -> 2837.13s]  Yeah yeah yeah.
[2837.13s -> 2843.08s]  This isn't Far Cry dude.
[2843.08s -> 2844.76s]  I'm not treating it like Far Cry.
[2844.76s -> 2849.86s]  I would have gone on the front door.
[2849.86s -> 2850.90s]  Goodness okay.
[2850.90s -> 2854.07s]  Anybody patrol this?
[2854.07s -> 2863.43s]  All right slow down.
[2863.43s -> 2863.99s]  Save.
[2863.99s -> 2871.29s]  Guys my Wendy's forgot special sauce.
[2871.29s -> 2872.44s]  What?
[2872.52s -> 2875.06s]  Dude that's not cool.
[2875.06s -> 2878.79s]  What was that?
[2878.79s -> 2879.19s]  Vase.
[2883.02s -> 2884.22s]  I want to hold on to this stuff.
[2884.22s -> 2886.09s]  I don't just want to throw it.
[2886.09s -> 2886.41s]  Okay.
[2887.13s -> 2888.94s]  What was that?
[2892.81s -> 2893.69s]  All right where am I now?
[2894.25s -> 2894.89s]  I'm in here.
[2897.38s -> 2898.50s]  Sneak into the manor.
[2899.06s -> 2899.38s]  Okay.
[2900.49s -> 2903.53s]  Steal the scepter with as little notice as possible.
[2903.53s -> 2906.47s]  There's another chest there.
[2906.47s -> 2907.27s]  I couldn't pick it up.
[2907.99s -> 2910.33s]  Oh I could.
[2910.33s -> 2911.37s]  All right cool.
[2911.37s -> 2919.77s]  All right I just gotta find the way up.
[2921.86s -> 2922.42s]  What the hell?
[2922.98s -> 2928.10s]  Who made that sound?
[2928.10s -> 2935.54s]  I'll never know.
[2935.54s -> 2936.10s]  He's just sleeping.
[2942.86s -> 2943.90s]  That guy's just sleeping in bed.
[2943.90s -> 2945.82s]  I gotta make it look not as bad though.
[2945.82s -> 2949.11s]  Okay that's fine.
[2949.11s -> 2950.15s]  He's asleep.
[2950.15s -> 2952.95s]  Now is this an innocent person?
[2952.95s -> 2953.35s]  Is this?
[2953.91s -> 2957.50s]  Can I loot their bodies?
[2966.04s -> 2966.92s]  They're all innocent.
[2968.79s -> 2974.10s]  Who's there?
[2974.10s -> 2975.94s]  No no no one's here.
[2975.94s -> 2976.74s]  Get out of here.
[2976.74s -> 2977.30s]  No one's here.
[2986.25s -> 2987.77s]  The humming makes that even better.
[2991.93s -> 2992.73s]  Did you hear something?
[2993.53s -> 2994.17s]  No.
[2994.17s -> 3003.35s]  I think we're almost there.
[3003.35s -> 3004.39s]  Yep let's go.
[3004.39s -> 3010.50s]  I think we're in.
[3013.74s -> 3014.46s]  Yeah we're in.
[3014.46s -> 3016.20s]  This is up.
[3016.20s -> 3017.72s]  We gotta get to the second floor.
[3017.72s -> 3020.71s]  Take out the bludgeoner.
[3024.55s -> 3025.03s]  Excuse me?
[3034.23s -> 3035.11s]  Is it like Resident Evil?
[3035.11s -> 3036.39s]  Can you like close the zombie out?
[3052.68s -> 3053.00s]  Shit.
[3063.42s -> 3063.58s]  No.
[3067.50s -> 3068.22s]  God damn it.
[3068.78s -> 3074.04s]  I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine.
[3074.04s -> 3074.52s]  Everything's fine.
[3074.52s -> 3075.00s]  Everything's fine.
[3075.00s -> 3076.44s]  Everything's fine I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine.
[3076.44s -> 3077.08s]  I gotta dump him.
[3082.63s -> 3083.51s]  You have no choice.
[3083.51s -> 3084.15s]  You must kill.
[3085.14s -> 3086.82s]  Well I need to put him somewhere.
[3086.82s -> 3088.26s]  Wait where am I?
[3096.73s -> 3097.29s]  What's happening?
[3097.29s -> 3097.85s]  I hear somebody.
[3112.65s -> 3113.67s]  Nice.
[3113.67s -> 3114.07s]  All right.
[3114.07s -> 3114.87s]  We're good we're good we're good.
[3115.43s -> 3124.41s]  How long do they stay unconscious for?
[3124.41s -> 3129.18s]  Oh god.
[3129.18s -> 3131.30s]  Is there a torch in here?
[3131.30s -> 3137.94s]  Mushroom.
[3137.94s -> 3154.70s]  Where are they?
[3154.70s -> 3157.70s]  Oh god.
[3157.70s -> 3160.55s]  Where are they?
[3160.55s -> 3163.13s]  Why are they getting closer?
[3163.13s -> 3173.03s]  Is it dark right here?
[3173.03s -> 3184.81s]  Where is this person?
[3184.81s -> 3196.84s]  We gotta get to the second floor.
[3196.84s -> 3205.06s]  Yaron made me smile?
[3205.06s -> 3207.77s]  Oh all right.
[3207.77s -> 3209.24s]  What did I do?
[3209.24s -> 3215.85s]  Oh god.
[3215.85s -> 3216.73s]  Okay this looks...
[3216.73s -> 3222.84s]  Is this like the kitchen?
[3222.84s -> 3226.63s]  All right this is the kitchen.
[3226.63s -> 3227.35s]  There's the chef.
[3227.35s -> 3229.69s]  What's he making?
[3229.69s -> 3232.89s]  The chef is making a delicious meal of apples.
[3232.89s -> 3236.07s]  I gotta knock you out man.
[3236.07s -> 3236.39s]  I'm sorry.
[3238.15s -> 3238.87s]  What was that?
[3244.15s -> 3245.75s]  I hit the chandelier.
[3245.75s -> 3247.70s]  Oh give me all these crunchies.
[3247.70s -> 3252.90s]  I didn't kill him.
[3256.47s -> 3257.75s]  I'm not gonna be a weirdo.
[3257.75s -> 3259.61s]  I'm gonna put him in a place where he's gonna be.
[3259.61s -> 3260.73s]  He's gonna wake up in a few hours
[3260.73s -> 3261.93s]  and it's gonna be fine.
[3261.93s -> 3265.54s]  I'm gonna hide him over here.
[3265.54s -> 3273.50s]  There's a note right here.
[3273.50s -> 3274.46s]  What does it say?
[3274.46s -> 3278.82s]  Cedric please speak to Cook about last night's dinner.
[3278.82s -> 3281.62s]  While technically the menu conformed to my instructions
[3281.62s -> 3285.06s]  I suspect that the lamb was somewhat older than this spring.
[3285.14s -> 3288.18s]  And I am in no way fooled by his practice of
[3288.18s -> 3291.78s]  warming the salad to disguise wilting.
[3291.78s -> 3295.14s]  If Cook is incapable of finding adequate ingredients
[3295.14s -> 3296.60s]  he can be replaced.
[3296.60s -> 3298.68s]  And if he offers those same excuses
[3298.68s -> 3301.08s]  about the stone market shortages
[3301.08s -> 3302.92s]  please remind him that the grocery budget
[3302.92s -> 3305.56s]  is a good 50% above last year's figures.
[3305.56s -> 3307.56s]  And even he should be able to procure
[3307.56s -> 3310.76s]  adequate victuals at those prices.
[3310.76s -> 3317.93s]  Oh we have his bread.
[3317.93s -> 3320.31s]  Oh carrots.
[3320.31s -> 3320.95s]  Bread.
[3320.95s -> 3322.73s]  A little mallet.
[3329.83s -> 3330.31s]  Leesies.
[3330.95s -> 3333.66s]  Ooh a pan.
[3333.66s -> 3334.22s]  More cheese.
[3335.66s -> 3339.32s]  I should probably eat some of this stuff.
[3339.32s -> 3340.28s]  Does this heal?
[3340.28s -> 3342.73s]  I don't see it.
[3342.73s -> 3343.61s]  This doesn't heal.
[3343.61s -> 3350.39s]  Hope you're having fun.
[3350.39s -> 3351.19s]  I'm having fun.
[3351.19s -> 3354.70s]  Oh I can't alt tab this game.
[3354.70s -> 3355.34s]  Let me see.
[3355.34s -> 3365.35s]  I got it on my phone.
[3365.35s -> 3384.95s]  What the fuck is alt-ish man?
[3384.95s -> 3394.87s]  I'm not even gonna react to this.
[3394.87s -> 3396.07s]  I'm not even gonna react to it.
[3396.07s -> 3399.82s]  That's it.
[3399.82s -> 3400.62s]  I'm gonna play Thief.
[3400.62s -> 3408.86s]  I was playing Thief.
[3408.86s -> 3409.82s]  I'm just playing a game of Thief.
[3409.82s -> 3410.30s]  That's it.
[3410.30s -> 3411.27s]  That's it.
[3411.27s -> 3411.99s]  I'm gonna keep going.
[3411.99s -> 3417.82s]  What was that?
[3417.82s -> 3423.22s]  Please, I just browsed it for a second, all right?
[3423.46s -> 3424.42s]  I saw it.
[3424.42s -> 3425.38s]  Why I saw it?
[3425.38s -> 3434.68s]  All right, where am I now?
[3434.68s -> 3437.99s]  All right, I gotta get up here into the interior courtyard.
[3437.99s -> 3447.48s]  Is it like a secret door?
[3447.48s -> 3448.28s]  Oh nothing.
[3448.28s -> 3455.94s]  I thought these were coffins.
[3455.94s -> 3457.86s]  All right, I gotta get upstairs.
[3457.86s -> 3465.51s]  What is all this?
[3465.51s -> 3468.36s]  Are you mad at us?
[3468.36s -> 3469.94s]  Mad at you?
[3469.94s -> 3472.20s]  Whoa, I just stole a bunch of stuff.
[3472.20s -> 3478.09s]  Okay, cool.
[3478.09s -> 3478.65s]  Hey.
[3478.65s -> 3506.62s]  Whoa, how did I turn around though?
[3506.62s -> 3509.45s]  My neck just enlarged.
[3509.45s -> 3512.01s]  My neck just stretched like 13 feet.
[3516.62s -> 3523.03s]  Stop it once and-
[3523.03s -> 3523.75s]  Shit, shit.
[3523.75s -> 3524.31s]  I'm dead.
[3524.31s -> 3534.84s]  How do we load?
[3534.84s -> 3535.34s]  F12.
[3541.80s -> 3542.52s]  What?
[3542.52s -> 3543.72s]  What are you talking about?
[3543.72s -> 3544.20s]  What?
[3544.20s -> 3545.08s]  What are you talking about?
[3545.08s -> 3546.52s]  What are you talking about?
[3546.52s -> 3547.08s]  What?
[3547.08s -> 3548.66s]  I don't understand.
[3548.66s -> 3550.01s]  Wasn't I saving it?
[3550.01s -> 3555.56s]  Okay, what?
[3555.56s -> 3557.88s]  I was gonna say that was like 30 minutes of progress.
[3557.88s -> 3569.78s]  All right, I can't mess around.
[3569.78s -> 3571.67s]  This is where I was.
[3573.14s -> 3573.86s]  Get out of the way.
[3573.86s -> 3577.38s]  I gotta get up the stairs.
[3577.38s -> 3581.62s]  Steal some of this stuff.
[3581.62s -> 3584.81s]  All right, slow down.
[3584.81s -> 3586.97s]  Use your sword on the banners to cut them.
[3586.97s -> 3596.94s]  I gotta be careful.
[3596.94s -> 3597.90s]  You can see me?
[3597.90s -> 3601.13s]  Stay out of the light.
[3601.13s -> 3603.50s]  All right, headshot this guy with a bow and arrow.
[3603.50s -> 3611.54s]  God damn it.
[3611.54s -> 3624.57s]  I need to throw something up there.
[3627.06s -> 3627.62s]  Stay in the dark.
[3627.62s -> 3629.61s]  Strange.
[3629.61s -> 3630.73s]  Whoa, that guy saw me.
[3631.93s -> 3632.25s]  Shit.
[3633.29s -> 3634.25s]  Oh, shit.
[3634.25s -> 3634.65s]  Oh, shit.
[3634.65s -> 3635.61s]  What if I just stay hidden?
[3636.49s -> 3647.00s]  Where is he?
[3656.73s -> 3662.62s]  Why would you still be using your bow?
[3662.62s -> 3663.58s]  Just duck.
[3663.58s -> 3671.88s]  Come under the stairs.
[3671.88s -> 3672.92s]  All right, here's the second floor right here.
[3672.92s -> 3673.88s]  We got it.
[3673.88s -> 3674.52s]  Oh, they're coming in.
[3675.08s -> 3687.43s]  Oh, shit.
[3687.43s -> 3697.59s]  Get him out of the light.
[3697.59s -> 3705.45s]  I think I'm okay.
[3705.45s -> 3706.57s]  I think I can go up the stairs now.
[3706.57s -> 3722.90s]  Where am I now?
[3722.90s -> 3724.97s]  All right.
[3724.97s -> 3726.01s]  Where is this guy?
[3726.01s -> 3733.18s]  I'm almost in his quarters.
[3733.18s -> 3734.06s]  Minecraft sounds.
[3734.06s -> 3741.93s]  These are Minecraft sounds.
[3741.93s -> 3743.45s]  Oh, boy.
[3743.53s -> 3744.89s]  Upstairs to the private chambers.
[3744.89s -> 3755.85s]  Bottom of the screen is light level.
[3755.85s -> 3758.36s]  Nobody will see you if it's dark.
[3758.36s -> 3764.81s]  Somebody had a lot of good advice there.
[3764.81s -> 3770.95s]  Oh, wait.
[3770.95s -> 3771.83s]  Okay.
[3771.83s -> 3773.27s]  You can load preset controls.
[3773.27s -> 3776.82s]  Blackjack only works if they don't know you're there.
[3776.82s -> 3778.42s]  If you pick something up
[3778.42s -> 3779.78s]  and it doesn't go in your inventory,
[3779.78s -> 3782.33s]  it's not worth anything.
[3782.33s -> 3783.53s]  Expert is not harder.
[3783.53s -> 3784.49s]  Just more objectives.
[3784.49s -> 3785.21s]  Oh, okay.
[3785.21s -> 3788.78s]  So this only works if you...
[3790.14s -> 3791.02s]  They can't see me.
[3791.02s -> 3800.31s]  But if they don't see me, is it an instant KO?
[3800.31s -> 3800.55s]  Yes.
[3800.55s -> 3801.35s]  Okay, cool.
[3801.35s -> 3803.06s]  There's no...
[3803.06s -> 3806.44s]  It's up here.
[3806.44s -> 3808.74s]  I thought those were guards.
[3808.74s -> 3813.30s]  Nothing up here.
[3813.30s -> 3819.26s]  It only works with the blackjack.
[3819.26s -> 3819.50s]  Okay.
[3820.14s -> 3826.04s]  Oh, we got a goblet here.
[3826.04s -> 3826.52s]  Nice.
[3826.52s -> 3828.68s]  Does it say how much this stuff was worth at the end?
[3828.68s -> 3844.30s]  I just ate a lot of food.
[3844.30s -> 3844.86s]  What does that do?
[3844.86s -> 3845.90s]  What does food even do?
[3845.90s -> 3849.00s]  All right.
[3849.00s -> 3850.20s]  We got to go up, not down.
[3850.20s -> 3855.30s]  Okay.
[3855.30s -> 3856.74s]  I cannot be seen right now.
[3856.74s -> 3868.86s]  I'm...
[3868.86s -> 3869.50s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[3869.50s -> 3870.14s]  Easy, easy.
[3870.14s -> 3872.46s]  It's probably somebody in the courtyard.
[3880.25s -> 3880.49s]  All right.
[3880.49s -> 3880.97s]  We're fine.
[3883.21s -> 3884.33s]  Don't just load.
[3884.33s -> 3884.97s]  Thank God.
[3884.97s -> 3887.45s]  I saved and loaded the same exact time, I think.
[3887.45s -> 3900.14s]  It's creepy.
[3900.14s -> 3902.78s]  What is this?
[3902.78s -> 3903.10s]  Yeah.
[3903.10s -> 3903.58s]  All right.
[3903.58s -> 3909.93s]  Walk on the carpet.
[3909.93s -> 3910.65s]  Where am I?
[3910.65s -> 3914.87s]  I have to mention second floor.
[3914.87s -> 3917.83s]  Throne room is right up here.
[3917.83s -> 3919.19s]  Is he in the throne room?
[3919.19s -> 3927.98s]  It's like the big dining hall.
[3927.98s -> 3937.46s]  What is this?
[3937.46s -> 3939.82s]  Is this like a secret room?
[3939.82s -> 3949.13s]  Oh, fuck you.
[3949.13s -> 3954.15s]  Stay right here.
[3961.69s -> 3966.71s]  All right.
[3966.71s -> 3973.26s]  If he's already seen me, does that mean...
[3973.26s -> 3974.70s]  Can I still get him in one hit?
[3974.70s -> 3982.34s]  Yes.
[3982.34s -> 3982.58s]  Okay.
[3982.58s -> 3982.90s]  Good.
[3982.90s -> 3997.29s]  I'm just saving it every five steps.
[3999.98s -> 4000.38s]  What?
[4000.38s -> 4001.42s]  How is that possible?
[4001.42s -> 4001.74s]  No.
[4001.74s -> 4009.18s]  Reload.
[4009.18s -> 4010.22s]  Somebody's seeing me.
[4010.22s -> 4013.67s]  I'm making noise.
[4013.67s -> 4014.15s]  Oh, whatever.
[4014.15s -> 4015.03s]  I don't have to hit anybody.
[4015.03s -> 4022.62s]  Let's just go.
[4022.62s -> 4022.86s]  Okay.
[4022.86s -> 4024.62s]  So where's my orientation here?
[4024.62s -> 4027.59s]  Throne room is this way.
[4027.59s -> 4029.82s]  The tile floor is really loud.
[4029.82s -> 4030.22s]  Yeah.
[4030.22s -> 4043.03s]  I have to go that way.
[4043.03s -> 4043.67s]  Shit.
[4043.67s -> 4043.91s]  Okay.
[4043.91s -> 4044.39s]  We're fine.
[4044.39s -> 4048.36s]  Is this a big bath?
[4055.13s -> 4056.25s]  Do you hear me go in the water?
[4057.21s -> 4058.01s]  Oh, great.
[4058.01s -> 4058.97s]  That's not good.
[4058.97s -> 4063.90s]  Does he care?
[4063.90s -> 4065.94s]  I don't think he cares.
[4065.94s -> 4074.52s]  Just don't move in the water.
[4074.52s -> 4081.30s]  I want to go inside of that thing,
[4081.30s -> 4086.82s]  but I don't want to.
[4086.82s -> 4088.02s]  Oh, boy.
[4088.02s -> 4095.42s]  You killed me in one hit.
[4095.42s -> 4095.90s]  Are you kidding me?
[4095.90s -> 4112.94s]  What do I have for armor?
[4112.94s -> 4113.26s]  No.
[4113.26s -> 4113.66s]  Fuck off.
[4113.66s -> 4114.73s]  I got it.
[4114.73s -> 4123.61s]  He didn't see me.
[4123.61s -> 4124.33s]  I'm fine.
[4124.33s -> 4133.43s]  Where's this other guy?
[4133.43s -> 4134.30s]  All right.
[4134.30s -> 4135.10s]  Nobody here.
[4135.10s -> 4139.67s]  Is it my going to the throne room?
[4139.67s -> 4141.99s]  I'm going back down.
[4141.99s -> 4153.56s]  Shit.
[4153.56s -> 4155.40s]  You jump from carpet to carpet.
[4155.40s -> 4162.97s]  Will they hear me jumping?
[4162.97s -> 4170.95s]  All right.
[4170.95s -> 4171.91s]  Water arrows.
[4171.91s -> 4174.70s]  So I can do this on torches, you said, right?
[4174.70s -> 4178.73s]  You got to use the rubber chicken
[4178.73s -> 4186.10s]  with a pulley in the middle of the water.
[4186.10s -> 4186.74s]  That's just good.
[4186.74s -> 4187.38s]  Absolute shit.
[4187.38s -> 4188.98s]  Why did that scare me so much?
[4188.98s -> 4191.34s]  I didn't expect he was going to be that close to me.
[4191.34s -> 4205.88s]  This guy's got golden armor on.
[4205.88s -> 4207.00s]  Swing at me, please.
[4207.00s -> 4217.45s]  He gave me a goddamn break.
[4217.45s -> 4222.42s]  All right.
[4222.42s -> 4223.78s]  Jump from place to place.
[4223.78s -> 4227.77s]  Holy shit.
[4227.77s -> 4228.25s]  It worked.
[4228.25s -> 4237.66s]  It worked.
[4237.66s -> 4238.86s]  What a bunch of geniuses.
[4238.86s -> 4239.58s]  Seriously.
[4239.58s -> 4245.10s]  Get you in the dark.
[4245.10s -> 4245.82s]  All right.
[4245.82s -> 4247.18s]  I have to save it.
[4247.18s -> 4248.94s]  I have the key to the throne room now.
[4255.64s -> 4260.04s]  Recent delivery of antiquities from Vaughn
[4260.04s -> 4262.84s]  contains several items which we felt might be of interest to you.
[4262.84s -> 4265.24s]  Descriptions follow, but you are welcome to drop by our shop
[4265.24s -> 4267.40s]  to examine them or other goods in person.
[4267.40s -> 4270.04s]  An ornamental scepter three feet in length.
[4270.04s -> 4271.00s]  That's huge.
[4271.00s -> 4275.13s]  The body of the stave is weird.
[4275.77s -> 4277.61s]  Carved in the star and dot pattern.
[4278.25s -> 4281.13s]  Six inches of the ferrule and five inches of the grip
[4281.13s -> 4285.05s]  are bound with burnished copper overlaid by an ink and glaze
[4286.01s -> 4286.98s]  varnish.
[4286.98s -> 4288.82s]  It's pretty good looking, I think.
[4288.82s -> 4291.05s]  Cloudstone, one of the finest of its type,
[4291.05s -> 4294.25s]  we have seen a treasure box of two feet by three feet of four feet
[4294.25s -> 4296.01s]  by silver birch wood.
[4296.01s -> 4298.97s]  The lid is really pretty.
[4298.97s -> 4302.01s]  The inside of the box contains two principal compartments,
[4302.01s -> 4304.49s]  one with glass shelves, and it's very expensive.
[4304.49s -> 4309.53s]  No.
[4309.53s -> 4311.64s]  Ooh.
[4311.64s -> 4312.44s]  Dog bone.
[4312.44s -> 4317.08s]  OK.
[4317.08s -> 4317.96s]  Let's keep going.
[4317.96s -> 4324.26s]  Where am I now?
[4324.26s -> 4324.82s]  All right.
[4324.82s -> 4326.66s]  I definitely have a key to the throne room.
[4326.66s -> 4331.51s]  Healing potion key.
[4331.51s -> 4332.31s]  That's a big key.
[4332.87s -> 4335.27s]  Where's the throne room, though?
[4335.67s -> 4350.89s]  Think you can just vanish in the shadows again, tricksy boy.
[4350.89s -> 4352.81s]  I've played enough Dark Souls to be able to do this.
[4352.81s -> 4353.45s]  OK, never mind.
[4366.65s -> 4382.87s]  Where did he come from?
[4382.87s -> 4384.07s]  No, don't shoot it.
[4384.07s -> 4385.03s]  How do I pull it back?
[4385.03s -> 4389.64s]  What happened?
[4389.64s -> 4391.00s]  I hit him in the leg and he died.
[4391.00s -> 4392.74s]  All right, we're good.
[4392.74s -> 4408.76s]  All right, I think I got to go down that hallway.
[4408.76s -> 4413.26s]  Let me see.
[4413.26s -> 4414.46s]  I can cut the banners.
[4414.46s -> 4415.66s]  I'm curious what that means.
[4415.66s -> 4419.08s]  What does that do?
[4419.08s -> 4427.90s]  I need the throne room.
[4427.90s -> 4428.86s]  Now I'm on this edge.
[4428.86s -> 4429.90s]  I got to go over here.
[4429.90s -> 4431.50s]  I wish I had an indicator of where I was.
[4431.50s -> 4436.28s]  It's probably the courtyard, right?
[4436.28s -> 4441.62s]  Press Y to fart.
[4441.62s -> 4445.50s]  I mean, I did it, just curious.
[4445.50s -> 4448.57s]  I have a compass.
[4448.57s -> 4452.38s]  It's a grenade.
[4452.38s -> 4454.54s]  All right, so what is the compass telling me to go?
[4454.54s -> 4460.47s]  So the compass is pointing in the direction I need to go?
[4462.74s -> 4466.33s]  Or OK, so is this north, southeast, right?
[4466.33s -> 4466.89s]  Am I?
[4466.89s -> 4469.19s]  Is that correct?
[4469.19s -> 4474.82s]  So I got to go this way, right?
[4474.82s -> 4476.26s]  Is this would be east?
[4481.83s -> 4484.87s]  The painted top is facing north, right?
[4487.70s -> 4490.26s]  Guys, I haven't looked at a compass in probably 20 years.
[4490.26s -> 4491.62s]  I don't even care what they are.
[4492.98s -> 4494.34s]  This is pointing north.
[4494.90s -> 4497.14s]  So that means that if I'm going this way,
[4497.14s -> 4498.82s]  that I'm currently going east.
[4498.82s -> 4501.48s]  That's correct?
[4505.80s -> 4506.12s]  Yes.
[4506.12s -> 4506.76s]  OK, right.
[4506.76s -> 4509.72s]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[4509.72s -> 4512.09s]  All right, so I got to go.
[4512.09s -> 4512.57s]  There we go.
[4512.57s -> 4513.21s]  Through that door.
[4513.85s -> 4516.87s]  OK, here we go.
[4516.87s -> 4525.24s]  This is it.
[4525.24s -> 4526.12s]  That's the throne, right?
[4526.68s -> 4527.48s]  No, it's a bed.
[4527.48s -> 4528.20s]  I thought it was it.
[4528.20s -> 4531.48s]  OK, from this angle, it looked like a big throne.
[4531.48s -> 4533.58s]  It's got a lot of money, though.
[4534.38s -> 4539.14s]  Another key.
[4539.94s -> 4540.50s]  What?
[4540.50s -> 4541.38s]  I don't know.
[4541.38s -> 4551.24s]  All right, not the throne room.
[4551.24s -> 4553.48s]  OK, it's another door on this side, then?
[4553.48s -> 4555.51s]  This is a personal bedroom.
[4555.51s -> 4557.93s]  Right here.
[4557.93s -> 4565.45s]  OK, this is locked.
[4565.45s -> 4566.17s]  This is locked.
[4567.45s -> 4568.09s]  Is he in here?
[4568.65s -> 4592.42s]  You're the flash bomb.
[4592.42s -> 4616.10s]  But I see this.
[4616.10s -> 4617.53s]  Ah!
[4617.53s -> 4618.17s]  I got him.
[4618.17s -> 4625.50s]  Is that a gong?
[4625.50s -> 4626.06s]  Don't touch that.
[4626.06s -> 4626.86s]  That's definitely like...
[4626.86s -> 4630.78s]  That's probably like an alarm.
[4630.78s -> 4633.05s]  All right, I made it to the throne room.
[4633.05s -> 4637.86s]  Tenches.
[4637.86s -> 4638.58s]  Here it is.
[4638.58s -> 4642.25s]  I found the scepter.
[4642.25s -> 4643.45s]  OK, scepter's right here.
[4644.95s -> 4646.07s]  Here we go.
[4646.07s -> 4646.55s]  All right.
[4646.55s -> 4651.18s]  Hell yeah.
[4651.18s -> 4658.50s]  I did it.
[4658.50s -> 4659.22s]  30 minutes.
[4659.22s -> 4661.14s]  Found 705 loot.
[4661.14s -> 4664.68s]  I picked one pocket.
[4664.68s -> 4665.96s]  Zero knockouts out of...
[4665.96s -> 4667.24s]  Wait, zero knockouts?
[4667.24s -> 4669.06s]  How?
[4669.06s -> 4670.42s]  Innocence killed some.
[4671.37s -> 4673.69s]  That's such a weird statistic.
[4673.69s -> 4676.54s]  This doesn't say how many.
[4676.54s -> 4679.94s]  Innocence killed, I don't know, a few.
[4679.94s -> 4681.38s]  I was not paying attention.
[4681.38s -> 4683.54s]  When I was writing down my debriefing,
[4683.54s -> 4685.54s]  I don't remember how many innocent people I killed.
[4685.54s -> 4688.22s]  So I just wrote some.
[4688.22s -> 4688.94s]  And others.
[4689.86s -> 4692.68s]  Ah.
[4692.68s -> 4693.72s]  Some and others.
[4693.72s -> 4694.36s]  I don't know, whatever.
[4694.36s -> 4698.82s]  I don't know who they were.
[4698.82s -> 4703.74s]  That was kind of fun.
[4703.74s -> 4704.54s]  You didn't hit the gong?
[4704.54s -> 4706.46s]  I didn't think I was going to end the mission right there.
[4707.18s -> 4715.94s]  Melting this down.
[4727.85s -> 4731.45s]  Someone just called Thief an unknown game that I dug up.
[4731.45s -> 4734.76s]  It got remade, what, four or five years ago?
[4735.77s -> 4736.65s]  Didn't they kind of do a remake?
[4737.21s -> 4740.44s]  I think so.
[4741.08s -> 4748.62s]  I went to Cuddy's place to deliver the sector.
[4748.62s -> 4749.90s]  That was ten years ago.
[4749.90s -> 4751.02s]  Wait, what?
[4751.02s -> 4752.62s]  It was ten years ago?
[4753.18s -> 4754.94s]  I thought that was like two years ago.
[4754.94s -> 4756.30s]  Apparently, they all proved of his occupation.
[4756.30s -> 4756.38s]  And I doubt they proved of mine.
[4756.38s -> 4758.22s]  It was 2014.
[4758.22s -> 4758.38s]  Really?
[4758.38s -> 4760.38s]  So hopefully, they'll never catch sight of me
[4760.38s -> 4761.90s]  when I break him out of their prison.
[4763.10s -> 4764.86s]  Which is what I'm going to do.
[4764.86s -> 4766.06s]  It was 2012.
[4766.06s -> 4771.00s]  They're holding Cuddy in a mine where he's flooded,
[4771.00s -> 4773.56s]  but the hammers still work the top-level mines
[4773.56s -> 4775.24s]  and have converted part of the complex
[4775.24s -> 4779.16s]  into a penitentiary for those who violate their tenets.
[4779.16s -> 4780.28s]  Reface came up for this one?
[4780.76s -> 4782.76s]  An associate of mine was confined there.
[4782.76s -> 4783.32s]  That was weird.
[4783.32s -> 4784.12s]  I don't know what happened there.
[4785.64s -> 4788.44s]  It would be difficult to get in by way of the main gate,
[4788.44s -> 4790.04s]  but there is another option.
[4790.60s -> 4793.64s]  The mines break the surface of a hill south of the quarry.
[4794.20s -> 4795.80s]  I'll drop into the mines and head for the mine.
[4795.80s -> 4796.84s]  Hairline check?
[4796.84s -> 4797.32s]  Got it.
[4797.32s -> 4799.48s]  Which way we found somewhere uphill into the north.
[4800.20s -> 4802.20s]  The hammers can venture into these lower mines.
[4802.20s -> 4803.08s]  It's getting worse, but it's okay.
[4803.08s -> 4807.67s]  Because they're reputed to be on this job,
[4807.67s -> 4809.35s]  but Cuddy's a reliable fence,
[4809.35s -> 4812.23s]  and I don't appreciate the hammerites abducting him.
[4813.43s -> 4813.67s]  All right.
[4813.67s -> 4816.07s]  So I got to break money for the Bafford job.
[4816.07s -> 4817.51s]  Break people out of jail?
[4818.23s -> 4824.46s]  Oh, your map doesn't show the way through the mine,
[4824.46s -> 4825.74s]  so you're going to have to scout around
[4825.74s -> 4827.58s]  to make your way to where they hold the prisoners.
[4828.22s -> 4830.82s]  Cuddy still owes you for the Bafford job.
[4830.82s -> 4832.42s]  Break him out and you'll get your cash.
[4832.42s -> 4833.38s]  All right.
[4833.38s -> 4836.34s]  I'm back.
[4836.34s -> 4836.66s]  Hold on.
[4836.66s -> 4838.26s]  Let me get the camera to look okay.
[4838.82s -> 4841.78s]  Let me wait.
[4841.78s -> 4843.06s]  Let me just get this done.
[4843.06s -> 4844.94s]  This is a dog bone.
[4848.94s -> 4849.58s]  How much is this?
[4850.14s -> 4850.94s]  I can buy this?
[4850.94s -> 4851.50s]  It's a tip.
[4852.06s -> 4855.64s]  It's 300 bucks,
[4856.44s -> 4859.00s]  and it reveals where the hammers are keeping Cuddy.
[4860.94s -> 4861.66s]  Speed potion.
[4861.66s -> 4863.66s]  This potion will greatly increase your speed for a little while.
[4863.66s -> 4864.38s]  I can just bunny hop.
[4867.77s -> 4869.61s]  I thought I said in Craigslist.
[4869.61s -> 4873.29s]  A former prisoner of Craigsleft says he has info about the haunted mines.
[4875.45s -> 4876.97s]  I have plenty of these.
[4876.97s -> 4877.61s]  Moss arrow.
[4880.10s -> 4880.82s]  Oh, okay.
[4880.82s -> 4882.34s]  That's actually really helpful.
[4882.34s -> 4883.06s]  Noisemaker?
[4884.28s -> 4885.32s]  Yeah, I want those.
[4885.88s -> 4892.18s]  I think I'm all right.
[4892.18s -> 4893.66s]  Is there anything?
[4893.66s -> 4895.42s]  Maybe I should buy another healing potion.
[4895.42s -> 4896.06s]  250.
[4896.70s -> 4897.72s]  I think it's worth it.
[4898.28s -> 4899.93s]  Probably buy it.
[4899.93s -> 4907.26s]  It's worth it.
[4907.26s -> 4909.58s]  Your cash does not carry over between missions.
[4909.58s -> 4910.78s]  It does not.
[4910.78s -> 4915.80s]  So should I just buy everything?
[4915.80s -> 4916.76s]  Okay, so there's no point.
[4917.48s -> 4918.60s]  So wait, give me that hot tip.
[4919.16s -> 4922.34s]  I want to know exactly where he is.
[4922.34s -> 4924.89s]  Give me the hot tip and give me a potion.
[4926.14s -> 4928.14s]  And how many arrows do I need?
[4928.14s -> 4929.50s]  Maybe a couple more of these moss arrows.
[4931.24s -> 4931.88s]  30 cents.
[4932.74s -> 4933.54s]  All right, I think that's good.
[4937.03s -> 4937.59s]  Spend it all.
[4937.59s -> 4937.83s]  All right.
[4937.83s -> 4939.56s]  Yeah, that's good to know.
[4939.56s -> 4939.96s]  All right.
[4939.96s -> 4941.72s]  This one, I'm going to save it right here.
[4941.72s -> 4943.64s]  I'm going to do like a hard save.
[4943.64s -> 4946.89s]  Let me get my camera to work.
[4946.89s -> 4950.82s]  Because the camera is like all buggy right now.
[4950.82s -> 4951.14s]  Hold on.
[4951.14s -> 4952.66s]  Let me turn on the ring light.
[4952.66s -> 4959.21s]  I've got a ring light.
[4959.21s -> 4965.58s]  How does that look?
[4965.58s -> 4968.28s]  That looks better or worse?
[4968.28s -> 4972.36s]  It needs to be a little bit brighter.
[4973.00s -> 4973.96s]  I like that.
[4973.96s -> 4979.40s]  It looks all right.
[4979.40s -> 4984.94s]  Is it better?
[4984.94s -> 4988.60s]  Yeah, look, I've got my ring light on now.
[4992.66s -> 4993.30s]  Okay.
[4993.30s -> 4999.66s]  How does that look?
[4999.66s -> 5000.54s]  Fine.
[5000.54s -> 5001.18s]  Do we look okay?
[5001.74s -> 5003.99s]  What is it, Ronnie?
[5003.99s -> 5006.23s]  I'm not putting the ring light around my neck.
[5006.23s -> 5007.11s]  It's not happening.
[5008.50s -> 5008.90s]  No.
[5008.90s -> 5011.62s]  Maybe if I can confirm that it's going to be safe, I'll do it.
[5011.62s -> 5012.87s]  All right.
[5012.87s -> 5014.95s]  You get face cam for a half of one mission.
[5014.95s -> 5018.60s]  Here we go.
[5018.60s -> 5026.02s]  I hope I didn't need that.
[5030.12s -> 5031.40s]  One full mission or no.
[5031.40s -> 5032.12s]  There is no deal.
[5032.12s -> 5034.28s]  I just turned it on and the white balance is wrong anyways.
[5034.28s -> 5034.84s]  Who cares?
[5034.84s -> 5036.12s]  Let me fix that quick.
[5036.12s -> 5041.29s]  All right.
[5041.29s -> 5044.65s]  It resets my camera settings every time I start.
[5044.65s -> 5051.40s]  It's better.
[5051.40s -> 5059.86s]  There we go.
[5059.86s -> 5062.50s]  That's like what it looks like in this room right now.
[5062.50s -> 5064.71s]  Like that.
[5064.71s -> 5065.43s]  Okay.
[5065.43s -> 5066.15s]  That's fine.
[5066.15s -> 5071.66s]  Is it a blue light?
[5072.14s -> 5072.62s]  I didn't even...
[5072.62s -> 5072.94s]  Whatever.
[5072.94s -> 5073.26s]  I don't care.
[5073.26s -> 5073.74s]  Let's just go.
[5075.14s -> 5075.38s]  All right.
[5075.38s -> 5078.02s]  I got to go through the mines and I got to find the...
[5078.02s -> 5079.30s]  I got to find the person.
[5079.30s -> 5081.88s]  I got to break the person out.
[5081.88s -> 5085.10s]  Can I smash somebody's head with a boulder?
[5085.10s -> 5085.66s]  I hope so.
[5085.66s -> 5086.30s]  We're going to try it.
[5086.94s -> 5098.01s]  Is it such a Bostonian?
[5098.57s -> 5101.22s]  Not anymore.
[5101.22s -> 5105.70s]  I've been not in Massachusetts for quite a while now.
[5105.70s -> 5109.08s]  Swim down.
[5109.08s -> 5116.47s]  So the goal is to get through...
[5117.03s -> 5125.27s]  I think I need to turn the bright...
[5125.27s -> 5125.91s]  What happened here?
[5137.61s -> 5138.25s]  That I deserve.
[5138.89s -> 5139.83s]  I did not realize...
[5139.83s -> 5140.87s]  I didn't know what was going on there.
[5140.87s -> 5140.95s]  Okay.
[5140.95s -> 5142.31s]  Give me my boulder back.
[5142.31s -> 5150.62s]  It was a...
[5150.62s -> 5151.10s]  All right.
[5151.10s -> 5152.38s]  It's marked on the map where he is, right?
[5153.56s -> 5155.00s]  Mines prison factory.
[5155.64s -> 5159.22s]  It's just like Dante's Inferno.
[5159.22s -> 5160.26s]  These are the layers of hell.
[5162.33s -> 5163.53s]  These are the layers.
[5164.25s -> 5170.28s]  What's this?
[5173.06s -> 5174.18s]  I thought that was an enemy.
[5174.18s -> 5176.02s]  I thought that was a person coming to get me.
[5176.02s -> 5179.19s]  What does that do?
[5179.83s -> 5185.02s]  Can I slash this?
[5185.58s -> 5189.46s]  What does this do?
[5190.97s -> 5192.25s]  Water arrows in it?
[5192.25s -> 5193.96s]  That's not a bad idea.
[5193.96s -> 5205.13s]  Holy water will kill zombies.
[5205.13s -> 5206.97s]  There are no zombies in this game.
[5206.97s -> 5221.56s]  There are zombies in this game.
[5221.96s -> 5233.50s]  Oh, that didn't do anything.
[5234.30s -> 5235.66s]  That didn't do anything.
[5235.66s -> 5252.50s]  What's that?
[5252.50s -> 5255.83s]  Where's the water?
[5255.83s -> 5256.55s]  Factory.
[5256.55s -> 5259.24s]  There it is.
[5259.24s -> 5260.68s]  Do I have to like bless myself?
[5261.32s -> 5262.04s]  All right.
[5262.04s -> 5264.70s]  I'm blessed.
[5264.70s -> 5273.72s]  It only lasts for 30 seconds.
[5273.72s -> 5275.00s]  It doesn't kill in one...
[5275.00s -> 5280.81s]  Holy shit.
[5280.81s -> 5291.96s]  What do I do about this?
[5305.54s -> 5306.50s]  I'm going to get up there somehow.
[5308.74s -> 5310.26s]  I'm going to turn the gam up.
[5310.26s -> 5311.78s]  I'm going to turn the gam up, I think.
[5311.78s -> 5313.99s]  Is that safe to go down there?
[5313.99s -> 5317.85s]  I'm going to turn the gam up.
[5323.91s -> 5327.82s]  I'm going to turn the gam up.
[5327.82s -> 5333.59s]  It's probably better, right?
[5333.59s -> 5336.63s]  I have more.
[5337.11s -> 5339.11s]  This is cheating probably, but I don't care.
[5339.11s -> 5344.62s]  Is it buying to lean over edges and look down?
[5344.62s -> 5351.10s]  I think I'm supposed to go down here.
[5351.10s -> 5352.06s]  Or up, I guess.
[5352.06s -> 5361.19s]  How high should I go?
[5364.01s -> 5366.81s]  I'm already dead right there.
[5373.26s -> 5374.30s]  Is that guy a zombie?
[5374.30s -> 5378.17s]  I think so, yeah.
[5378.17s -> 5382.15s]  Can I just...
[5382.15s -> 5383.35s]  Okay, can I kill him?
[5383.35s -> 5384.55s]  Like with the sword?
[5384.55s -> 5390.54s]  Is this the zombie?
[5390.54s -> 5391.66s]  Why is he just breathing?
[5397.53s -> 5398.41s]  What happened?
[5398.41s -> 5398.97s]  Is he dead?
[5398.97s -> 5399.37s]  Ah!
[5399.37s -> 5400.57s]  I knew somebody was right near me.
[5400.57s -> 5401.29s]  What happened?
[5401.29s -> 5401.93s]  What?
[5401.93s -> 5403.21s]  It's not even fucking scary.
[5403.21s -> 5403.69s]  Relax.
[5403.69s -> 5405.05s]  Don't overreact for no reason.
[5405.61s -> 5406.49s]  Overactor.
[5406.49s -> 5407.29s]  Overreactor.
[5408.79s -> 5410.15s]  I thought that was him breathing.
[5410.71s -> 5412.46s]  I can't hurt him.
[5412.46s -> 5413.10s]  Okay, bad.
[5414.14s -> 5418.33s]  Are you going to give me a dead end?
[5427.42s -> 5431.26s]  They're taking up the exact space that I need to run around them.
[5431.26s -> 5438.26s]  I still have a grenade.
[5462.10s -> 5463.62s]  What is happening in this game?
[5467.59s -> 5467.91s]  Okay.
[5471.00s -> 5472.28s]  Is this a haunted house now?
[5474.82s -> 5475.38s]  All right.
[5475.38s -> 5476.10s]  Um, okay.
[5476.10s -> 5477.22s]  I got to keep going up.
[5477.22s -> 5478.82s]  Keep going north, I guess.
[5478.82s -> 5479.30s]  Or up?
[5479.94s -> 5486.84s]  I hear...
[5486.84s -> 5488.42s]  I hear humans.
[5488.42s -> 5489.22s]  I hear human life.
[5511.61s -> 5523.35s]  You get one little measly health back for a fucking $300 health potion.
[5523.35s -> 5533.67s]  I have those noise arrows, right?
[5533.67s -> 5534.15s]  Let me...
[5534.15s -> 5536.28s]  Okay, let me use them.
[5536.28s -> 5536.92s]  Moss arrow.
[5537.74s -> 5538.38s]  Noise arrow.
[5538.94s -> 5571.43s]  Quiet.
[5571.43s -> 5584.20s]  He's right there.
[5584.20s -> 5588.74s]  Get him right now.
[5588.74s -> 5596.98s]  I thought I spied something.
[5596.98s -> 5597.78s]  Hiding shall...
[5600.30s -> 5602.86s]  I threw a shovel at him and he didn't even care.
[5602.86s -> 5611.10s]  It takes care of those too.
[5611.10s -> 5614.14s]  Where am I at?
[5614.14s -> 5615.02s]  I got to go up.
[5615.02s -> 5616.04s]  This, uh...
[5616.04s -> 5617.48s]  I can go up that way, but what's over here?
[5626.09s -> 5627.05s]  This is a secret or something?
[5627.05s -> 5627.61s]  Something I can get?
[5628.25s -> 5629.11s]  I'll check it.
[5629.11s -> 5629.43s]  Why not?
[5632.76s -> 5634.60s]  Oh, I think this is a different entrance.
[5634.60s -> 5637.46s]  Can I swim up it like a salmon?
[5639.86s -> 5640.42s]  No.
[5640.42s -> 5640.82s]  Okay.
[5640.82s -> 5642.02s]  So this is another way to get down here.
[5642.58s -> 5646.34s]  Excuse me.
[5646.34s -> 5648.66s]  What's this?
[5659.16s -> 5660.68s]  Too far, too far, too far, too far.
[5661.24s -> 5663.19s]  I'm gonna get lost if I don't cut it out.
[5669.90s -> 5670.78s]  Guards had keys.
[5671.34s -> 5672.38s]  I think I got them.
[5672.38s -> 5675.35s]  I didn't get the keys?
[5675.99s -> 5678.81s]  I thought when I picked them up, it would just give it to me.
[5679.37s -> 5687.75s]  According to Dickit, a heretic who was recently let out of Craigslist,
[5687.75s -> 5690.47s]  Cutty's being held in cell block four.
[5691.03s -> 5692.47s]  Okay.
[5692.47s -> 5693.75s]  So he's in cell block four.
[5694.39s -> 5695.86s]  They had keys?
[5695.86s -> 5696.34s]  I didn't take...
[5699.72s -> 5700.44s]  Oh, shit.
[5700.44s -> 5700.76s]  Okay.
[5701.48s -> 5707.75s]  I thought I was gonna just pick it up on their body and not get his key anymore.
[5708.31s -> 5714.97s]  Where is it?
[5714.97s -> 5718.20s]  I don't know.
[5718.20s -> 5729.00s]  Babe.
[5729.00s -> 5730.98s]  It was just the potion?
[5730.98s -> 5731.38s]  All right.
[5731.38s -> 5737.64s]  So cell block four.
[5737.64s -> 5738.28s]  Here we are.
[5738.28s -> 5739.40s]  Careful, guard stations.
[5739.40s -> 5740.04s]  All right.
[5740.04s -> 5742.36s]  Control room, machine room, power station.
[5742.36s -> 5743.08s]  This is to the mine.
[5743.08s -> 5745.08s]  So we're going through and we're gonna be in the control room.
[5745.08s -> 5747.18s]  I'm gonna get to the prison.
[5747.82s -> 5762.94s]  Shit.
[5762.94s -> 5770.98s]  You idiot.
[5770.98s -> 5771.54s]  You idiot.
[5772.18s -> 5774.87s]  It's dark right here.
[5774.87s -> 5775.43s]  He can't see me.
[5787.45s -> 5789.10s]  What are you saying?
[5797.88s -> 5804.36s]  Do you have anything on you?
[5804.36s -> 5805.08s]  A key or anything?
[5805.64s -> 5806.58s]  No.
[5806.58s -> 5806.90s]  All right.
[5806.90s -> 5808.10s]  Move this shit out of the way.
[5808.10s -> 5818.47s]  Mine...
[5820.01s -> 5820.49s]  Okay.
[5820.49s -> 5825.78s]  I need those arrows right now.
[5825.78s -> 5826.58s]  Oh, shit.
[5826.58s -> 5827.38s]  He didn't see it.
[5827.38s -> 5827.78s]  I don't want...
[5828.34s -> 5847.64s]  All right.
[5847.64s -> 5847.96s]  I'm good.
[5847.96s -> 5848.28s]  I'm good.
[5848.28s -> 5849.16s]  Good, good, good, good, good.
[5849.16s -> 5849.56s]  He can't...
[5849.56s -> 5850.60s]  I'm in pitch black right now.
[5850.60s -> 5851.16s]  He can't see me.
[5851.72s -> 5862.31s]  Like there's a steam engine over there masking my sounds.
[5862.31s -> 5864.01s]  All right.
[5864.01s -> 5864.49s]  Come on.
[5864.49s -> 5864.89s]  This way.
[5865.53s -> 5869.51s]  All right.
[5870.15s -> 5874.41s]  Tread softly.
[5875.05s -> 5879.64s]  All right.
[5879.64s -> 5880.28s]  Toss him in the corner.
[5880.92s -> 5890.17s]  Okay.
[5890.17s -> 5891.05s]  That's the only thing I can press.
[5894.87s -> 5899.48s]  I thought I was going to shock the floor.
[5906.89s -> 5916.68s]  I thought I was going to just electrocute the ground in this.
[5917.82s -> 5918.86s]  That was so loud.
[5918.86s -> 5919.66s]  My ears hurt.
[5920.30s -> 5920.78s]  Okay.
[5921.74s -> 5923.18s]  Machine rooms, control room.
[5923.18s -> 5924.54s]  We've got to go up here.
[5924.54s -> 5928.76s]  Okay.
[5928.76s -> 5929.72s]  Get to the prison.
[5929.72s -> 5931.08s]  That's what that's all I got to do.
[5931.08s -> 5933.24s]  Save it right here.
[5933.24s -> 5934.28s]  Why you like this?
[5934.28s -> 5936.84s]  Because I attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
[5936.84s -> 5939.48s]  And I'm like irrational and compulsive.
[5940.97s -> 5942.09s]  Very high, strong, neurotic.
[5942.65s -> 5943.05s]  I don't know.
[5943.77s -> 5945.67s]  That's why.
[5945.67s -> 5946.63s]  And I'm like being cut off.
[5947.66s -> 5948.46s]  Nice excuse.
[5948.46s -> 5949.58s]  I know it's not an excuse.
[5949.58s -> 5950.22s]  It really isn't.
[5950.22s -> 5951.02s]  I know.
[5951.02s -> 5964.82s]  I said neurotic, not erotic.
[5966.49s -> 5967.37s]  Open your ears.
[5968.01s -> 5974.82s]  Are there people down here?
[5974.82s -> 5975.78s]  Because this is the...
[5975.78s -> 5979.02s]  Oh, this is the way to get to the factory.
[5979.02s -> 5979.90s]  I mean to the prison.
[5983.43s -> 5984.07s]  I'm not erotic.
[5984.63s -> 5995.18s]  Why does it not work?
[5995.18s -> 5998.65s]  What am I dumping?
[5999.21s -> 6006.71s]  What happened?
[6007.67s -> 6009.14s]  What happened?
[6009.14s -> 6009.94s]  Why somebody screamed?
[6010.66s -> 6017.82s]  What?
[6018.38s -> 6021.45s]  It was me screaming.
[6021.69s -> 6027.78s]  I was not even close.
[6028.50s -> 6028.82s]  All right.
[6028.82s -> 6030.58s]  I'll fucking take out some people here.
[6039.51s -> 6041.51s]  Let's turn him into hot fucking magma.
[6041.51s -> 6042.23s]  Come on over here.
[6043.43s -> 6044.07s]  Come on over here.
[6044.07s -> 6044.71s]  Come on over here.
[6046.12s -> 6047.08s]  Come on over here, coward.
[6047.08s -> 6047.40s]  Hey, look.
[6047.40s -> 6048.04s]  You flipped me off.
[6055.51s -> 6055.99s]  Where is he?
[6065.56s -> 6065.80s]  What?
[6066.60s -> 6067.62s]  What is that?
[6088.15s -> 6089.51s]  Where is he going?
[6089.51s -> 6090.07s]  Where are you going?
[6097.53s -> 6101.37s]  Oh, somebody's bleeding.
[6103.99s -> 6104.31s]  Got him.
[6105.11s -> 6109.88s]  Oh, I got the...
[6109.88s -> 6110.44s]  I got a hammer.
[6110.44s -> 6111.16s]  What do I do with this?
[6111.80s -> 6116.73s]  What do I do with the hammer?
[6116.73s -> 6117.77s]  Is somebody still alive?
[6118.33s -> 6132.30s]  Oh, I got two hammers.
[6132.30s -> 6132.62s]  All right.
[6133.26s -> 6136.82s]  What does this one make?
[6136.82s -> 6139.96s]  This one also makes hammers.
[6139.96s -> 6140.76s]  No, I don't want any of this.
[6140.76s -> 6141.24s]  Give me the...
[6141.24s -> 6141.88s]  Just give me the hammer.
[6142.44s -> 6154.30s]  Fucking asshole.
[6155.18s -> 6159.21s]  I tried to jump over it.
[6160.89s -> 6161.29s]  All right.
[6161.29s -> 6162.17s]  No more messing around.
[6185.48s -> 6186.12s]  Fucking idiot.
[6186.76s -> 6199.78s]  He's up here.
[6212.90s -> 6213.38s]  Oh, shit.
[6214.58s -> 6240.36s]  Oh, fuck you.
[6240.36s -> 6241.16s]  Come on, dude.
[6242.68s -> 6249.29s]  Don't even...
[6249.85s -> 6265.05s]  Who swings a hammer like this with one hand?
[6265.05s -> 6267.77s]  Like up that you can't even do that move.
[6267.77s -> 6269.29s]  That move isn't even possible.
[6270.09s -> 6275.61s]  You can't take a huge two-handed hammer and go like this
[6275.61s -> 6277.93s]  and have it hit me right square in the front of the nose.
[6278.73s -> 6293.06s]  I got an idea.
[6299.32s -> 6300.28s]  Madka's bad.
[6300.28s -> 6300.52s]  Yeah.
[6301.32s -> 6304.54s]  I saw.
[6304.54s -> 6304.94s]  Move.
[6356.57s -> 6369.51s]  You guys have anything on you?
[6369.51s -> 6369.99s]  No.
[6369.99s -> 6379.46s]  Kind of show me her right.
[6379.46s -> 6380.42s]  Yeah, rats.
[6380.42s -> 6381.38s]  Just rats.
[6381.38s -> 6392.68s]  That guy was singing.
[6398.26s -> 6415.96s]  All right, he's hidden.
[6415.96s -> 6423.54s]  I think there's one more guy here.
[6423.54s -> 6424.34s]  The prison.
[6424.34s -> 6427.78s]  Did I make one of these things though?
[6427.78s -> 6429.99s]  I feel like I need to take one of these.
[6430.07s -> 6452.38s]  Never face tribulation in their lives.
[6453.66s -> 6453.98s]  What?
[6453.98s -> 6454.62s]  There's nobody...
[6454.62s -> 6455.98s]  No, you don't look in the...
[6455.98s -> 6456.30s]  What?
[6456.30s -> 6457.66s]  You don't look over here.
[6458.22s -> 6459.50s]  Why would you be like,
[6459.50s -> 6464.14s]  in time, I believe that thief Cuddy's friend has some...
[6464.14s -> 6464.94s]  Why would you be doing that?
[6464.94s -> 6465.98s]  You're just having a conversation.
[6470.65s -> 6486.30s]  There's no way you're as fast as me be hopping, bro.
[6486.30s -> 6486.94s]  I'm sorry.
[6486.94s -> 6487.58s]  There's no way.
[6497.61s -> 6498.73s]  You stupid game.
[6498.73s -> 6499.61s]  Whatever.
[6499.61s -> 6507.30s]  What do you mean mad at somebody?
[6507.30s -> 6508.42s]  I'm just saying.
[6508.42s -> 6509.38s]  If you have...
[6509.38s -> 6509.62s]  Okay.
[6510.26s -> 6511.86s]  If you and I are having a conversation.
[6512.42s -> 6513.14s]  We're just talking.
[6513.86s -> 6514.26s]  Yes.
[6514.26s -> 6515.70s]  Okay, you're right here.
[6517.11s -> 6519.03s]  Like this whole space,
[6519.03s -> 6522.65s]  like this spot over here in the corner,
[6523.29s -> 6524.17s]  I am not going to...
[6524.17s -> 6526.49s]  If I see like a squirrel move over there,
[6526.49s -> 6528.73s]  I'm not going to immediately take a sword out and run over there.
[6529.29s -> 6530.57s]  We're in the middle of a conversation.
[6530.57s -> 6532.89s]  I'm not just going to peer that way
[6532.89s -> 6534.33s]  and go after whatever it is.
[6534.89s -> 6536.25s]  No, it's not going to happen.
[6542.42s -> 6543.30s]  They're prison guards.
[6543.94s -> 6544.58s]  Oh, but that...
[6551.82s -> 6563.53s]  We didn't even know I was there.
[6589.45s -> 6591.61s]  So you're telling me that they're prison guards.
[6591.61s -> 6592.65s]  Do you remember they're prison guards?
[6592.65s -> 6593.13s]  They're guards.
[6593.13s -> 6595.11s]  Do you remember they're prison guards?
[6595.11s -> 6596.95s]  I just threw one of those nerf...
[6598.04s -> 6599.56s]  You know those nerf whistleers?
[6600.20s -> 6602.44s]  The thing that like Brett Favre was in the commercial
[6602.44s -> 6603.64s]  and he threw it like, look this,
[6603.64s -> 6604.84s]  I can throw this 100 yards.
[6604.84s -> 6605.32s]  And it goes...
[6607.32s -> 6610.01s]  I just threw one of those right next to them
[6610.01s -> 6611.13s]  and they didn't even hear it.
[6611.13s -> 6613.54s]  I just whipped one of those
[6613.54s -> 6615.06s]  and you're telling me that they're...
[6615.06s -> 6616.50s]  Aren't they supposed to be aware?
[6616.50s -> 6633.86s]  No reaction.
[6683.26s -> 6684.22s]  Why are they doing this?
[6701.34s -> 6705.82s]  Block four.
[6705.82s -> 6706.38s]  All right, let's go.
[6715.51s -> 6719.03s]  What happened?
[6732.18s -> 6732.58s]  Why did...
[6732.58s -> 6733.14s]  What happened?
[6733.70s -> 6739.06s]  I'm confused what just happened.
[6739.78s -> 6743.10s]  This guy didn't see me.
[6743.74s -> 6748.39s]  It was a medieval security camera.
[6748.39s -> 6751.85s]  Who saw me?
[6751.85s -> 6752.41s]  I don't get it.
[6756.78s -> 6758.78s]  It's just like a little thing going like this.
[6773.38s -> 6774.58s]  Who can see me right now?
[6781.16s -> 6784.04s]  They didn't even have sound effects like this back then.
[6784.76s -> 6785.08s]  What?
[6788.71s -> 6789.91s]  It's in the ceiling.
[6789.91s -> 6790.71s]  No, it's not.
[6795.98s -> 6797.74s]  That's what's seeing me?
[6797.74s -> 6799.10s]  I thought you guys were making it up.
[6799.10s -> 6800.86s]  I thought that was a joke.
[6801.66s -> 6803.66s]  There's a medieval security camera.
[6808.01s -> 6808.73s]  Are you kidding me?
[6809.53s -> 6814.17s]  So what am I supposed to do about that?
[6814.89s -> 6816.62s]  I guess put this out?
[6818.89s -> 6820.01s]  Can it see in the dark?
[6820.65s -> 6831.13s]  Okay, I can't go this way.
[6843.48s -> 6844.84s]  I thought I could get him.
[6844.84s -> 6846.28s]  I thought I'd just go into the window.
[6846.92s -> 6865.88s]  Oh, can I go under here and then above?
[6867.70s -> 6869.54s]  I guess I can wrap around maybe and go up.
[6872.33s -> 6872.81s]  I don't know.
[6875.02s -> 6875.90s]  It's steampunk.
[6876.46s -> 6883.19s]  You know, steampunk is like the Jedi hand wave for all fiction.
[6891.05s -> 6892.01s]  Who passes there?
[6892.65s -> 6897.62s]  It's steampunk.
[6897.62s -> 6898.42s]  I would not have thought...
[6898.42s -> 6899.22s]  Therefore, it's fine.
[6899.22s -> 6900.82s]  ...dare their teeth against the builders' house.
[6900.82s -> 6901.38s]  Steampunk.
[6901.38s -> 6902.26s]  Therefore, it's fine.
[6905.90s -> 6906.54s]  Oh, shit.
[6906.54s -> 6906.94s]  Oh, shit.
[6906.94s -> 6907.42s]  Oh, shit.
[6907.42s -> 6915.29s]  Who are thou?
[6915.29s -> 6915.77s]  Okay.
[6915.77s -> 6916.17s]  All right.
[6917.05s -> 6917.69s]  Very clearly.
[6917.69s -> 6918.41s]  That guy's got a key.
[6923.34s -> 6924.30s]  Use the walk button?
[6924.30s -> 6926.76s]  I'm thinking about just running in.
[6930.15s -> 6939.32s]  Somebody comes up here and patrols, and I need to be aware of that.
[6940.12s -> 6940.92s]  Just rush in.
[6942.86s -> 6944.06s]  I can't just rush in.
[6945.48s -> 6946.28s]  I think I can...
[6948.98s -> 6949.78s]  He heard you walk.
[6949.78s -> 6955.83s]  I think I have to go down to the sewer as much as I don't want to.
[6956.55s -> 6957.75s]  Okay, this guy's coming over here.
[6960.76s -> 6962.92s]  I'll knock this guy out in the corner.
[6963.72s -> 6969.18s]  The light goes out for a minute.
[6969.18s -> 6971.82s]  It does.
[6972.54s -> 6973.58s]  One, two, three.
[6975.40s -> 6976.36s]  One, two, three.
[6983.13s -> 7003.99s]  This guy's just gargling in the mirror.
[7008.65s -> 7009.37s]  Nobody.
[7009.37s -> 7010.09s]  Nobody goes.
[7012.01s -> 7013.26s]  How...
[7013.26s -> 7013.82s]  When do I go?
[7014.54s -> 7016.30s]  Oh, that's not much time at all.
[7016.30s -> 7019.90s]  One, two, one, two, three.
[7019.90s -> 7020.40s]  Go.
[7021.10s -> 7024.73s]  Save it?
[7024.73s -> 7025.37s]  Save it, save it, save it.
[7026.09s -> 7028.22s]  Double up four.
[7028.22s -> 7042.30s]  Which one...
[7042.30s -> 7043.26s]  What is he in?
[7043.26s -> 7045.54s]  I need my hot tip.
[7046.18s -> 7051.42s]  According to Dickit, a heretic who was recently let out of Craig's Cleft,
[7051.42s -> 7053.82s]  Cuddy, is being held in cell block four.
[7054.62s -> 7056.34s]  How do I distract this guy?
[7061.82s -> 7062.38s]  I need it.
[7062.38s -> 7062.86s]  I need help.
[7062.86s -> 7063.58s]  All right.
[7063.58s -> 7064.22s]  Let's see what I can do.
[7066.07s -> 7066.71s]  Noise arrow?
[7067.43s -> 7071.56s]  I hear somebody coming over here.
[7072.94s -> 7073.34s]  Oh, God.
[7073.34s -> 7073.66s]  Oh, God.
[7073.66s -> 7074.06s]  What do I do?
[7074.06s -> 7074.86s]  What do I do?
[7074.86s -> 7075.26s]  Oh, God.
[7075.26s -> 7075.66s]  What do I do?
[7076.54s -> 7081.45s]  Let me in.
[7081.45s -> 7081.69s]  Let me in.
[7081.69s -> 7082.09s]  Open the door.
[7082.09s -> 7082.57s]  Open the door.
[7082.57s -> 7082.73s]  Open.
[7090.09s -> 7090.33s]  Where?
[7099.29s -> 7100.01s]  Out of here.
[7100.01s -> 7105.08s]  Got him.
[7105.08s -> 7117.98s]  We good?
[7117.98s -> 7118.70s]  Where is this guy?
[7126.44s -> 7131.56s]  Oh, shit.
[7146.78s -> 7148.70s]  You piece of...
[7148.70s -> 7149.66s]  No way.
[7149.66s -> 7150.14s]  No way.
[7150.70s -> 7160.78s]  No, turn it off.
[7160.78s -> 7161.82s]  Turn it off.
[7161.82s -> 7162.30s]  Turn it off.
[7167.83s -> 7169.11s]  Kill this motherfucker.
[7169.75s -> 7169.99s]  What?
[7170.79s -> 7184.46s]  I was just kidding.
[7184.46s -> 7186.60s]  I was just testing to see if it worked.
[7186.60s -> 7191.40s]  We were just having an electrical test to see if it worked or not.
[7191.40s -> 7192.84s]  If we just have an electrical test.
[7200.70s -> 7201.74s]  Get out of the fucking way.
[7201.74s -> 7202.30s]  He's in the way.
[7220.06s -> 7222.39s]  You got to be kidding me, dude.
[7222.47s -> 7223.03s]  He's going to go...
[7223.83s -> 7225.51s]  I'm going to go channel channel.
[7225.51s -> 7226.31s]  He's kidding me.
[7227.35s -> 7228.39s]  Run away, coward.
[7229.03s -> 7229.83s]  Run away, coward.
[7232.12s -> 7232.36s]  All right.
[7232.36s -> 7233.96s]  No more Alex Jones.
[7236.50s -> 7236.90s]  He's...
[7236.90s -> 7238.42s]  Oh, yeah.
[7238.42s -> 7239.94s]  I can't get in there now, can I?
[7246.42s -> 7248.42s]  You didn't think I was going to be able to get in and get you, did you?
[7257.85s -> 7258.89s]  Ah, now you can't get in.
[7259.53s -> 7260.65s]  Now I can stay here.
[7261.37s -> 7265.42s]  Awesome.
[7265.42s -> 7266.54s]  Lady Taker.
[7266.54s -> 7267.34s]  Lisa Vandal.
[7268.06s -> 7268.94s]  Wills.
[7268.94s -> 7269.58s]  Number six.
[7270.30s -> 7270.70s]  Cutty.
[7271.26s -> 7276.20s]  How do I turn this off?
[7276.76s -> 7282.84s]  How do I turn this off?
[7283.48s -> 7290.55s]  Good luck.
[7291.42s -> 7292.70s]  It's kind of crazy out there.
[7293.50s -> 7295.42s]  That guy's going to get fucking grabbed.
[7309.29s -> 7310.57s]  How many cells do I have?
[7310.57s -> 7311.21s]  Where's six?
[7312.09s -> 7312.89s]  Hey, Cutty.
[7312.89s -> 7313.13s]  Come on.
[7313.13s -> 7313.85s]  Come with me.
[7313.85s -> 7314.73s]  We got to get out of here.
[7314.73s -> 7315.37s]  Immediately.
[7320.54s -> 7321.34s]  Speak into my ear.
[7339.66s -> 7351.80s]  I'm imagining the guy that ran out first.
[7355.56s -> 7357.80s]  They're all going to just pile on top of that guy.
[7357.80s -> 7359.16s]  And like, he's the bad guy.
[7359.16s -> 7360.28s]  He's the one that broke out.
[7360.28s -> 7361.72s]  He caused all this.
[7361.72s -> 7362.52s]  What happened to you?
[7363.16s -> 7363.40s]  What?
[7364.36s -> 7365.90s]  What happened?
[7365.90s -> 7366.62s]  What's wrong with him?
[7371.80s -> 7373.00s]  Was that supposed to happen?
[7373.00s -> 7373.56s]  I'll get him out.
[7374.20s -> 7375.64s]  What's the new objective?
[7381.45s -> 7382.49s]  I failed this one.
[7382.49s -> 7383.29s]  Okay.
[7383.29s -> 7385.53s]  Find the evidence locker and retrieve Felix's map.
[7386.09s -> 7389.02s]  All right.
[7389.02s -> 7389.74s]  Evidence locker.
[7391.19s -> 7392.39s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7392.39s -> 7392.71s]  Off.
[7392.71s -> 7392.95s]  Okay.
[7392.95s -> 7394.07s]  Barracks and offices quarters.
[7394.07s -> 7394.71s]  We've got to go this way.
[7400.46s -> 7401.26s]  Did I save it?
[7401.26s -> 7402.62s]  I feel like I shouldn't.
[7402.62s -> 7409.13s]  How do I get out of here?
[7409.13s -> 7422.82s]  Level two.
[7422.82s -> 7422.98s]  All right.
[7422.98s -> 7423.70s]  I'm in level two.
[7424.82s -> 7425.38s]  Guards.
[7427.42s -> 7429.42s]  I couldn't hear anything from that cut scene
[7429.42s -> 7430.46s]  because the blaring...
[7437.30s -> 7437.94s]  Open the door.
[7438.50s -> 7445.96s]  How do I turn the alarm off?
[7449.78s -> 7450.82s]  I need the key.
[7450.82s -> 7451.62s]  Leave the corpse.
[7452.26s -> 7459.38s]  What is this?
[7459.38s -> 7459.94s]  What kind of...
[7462.49s -> 7463.21s]  What?
[7463.21s -> 7464.65s]  A weird door.
[7464.65s -> 7464.89s]  What?
[7465.85s -> 7466.57s]  That's...
[7466.57s -> 7466.89s]  Okay.
[7467.45s -> 7477.13s]  Just in case shit hits the absolute fan,
[7477.13s -> 7478.65s]  I have a save point back there.
[7479.29s -> 7480.04s]  All right.
[7480.04s -> 7483.08s]  I need to find the map in the officer's quarters.
[7483.80s -> 7485.00s]  Find the evidence locker.
[7485.56s -> 7489.24s]  Evidence locker.
[7493.90s -> 7494.46s]  Nothing in there.
[7494.46s -> 7494.86s]  All right.
[7494.86s -> 7495.10s]  Shit.
[7495.10s -> 7495.42s]  Hold on.
[7495.42s -> 7501.56s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7501.56s -> 7503.24s]  Why does the prison have door locks?
[7504.84s -> 7505.64s]  I don't know, dude.
[7508.54s -> 7509.02s]  What did you do?
[7509.02s -> 7510.06s]  I'm needing to be distracted.
[7510.54s -> 7511.10s]  I want you to...
[7511.10s -> 7513.18s]  What I want you to do is I want you to scream really loud
[7513.18s -> 7514.38s]  when I walk over this way
[7514.38s -> 7516.06s]  so the guard will come over and I'll knock him out.
[7544.63s -> 7546.89s]  He's dead?
[7550.46s -> 7550.70s]  Hey.
[7552.17s -> 7552.89s]  Excellent job.
[7553.53s -> 7555.10s]  I was thinking about it.
[7555.10s -> 7555.42s]  No.
[7555.42s -> 7556.46s]  I can't zoom out, though.
[7568.82s -> 7569.38s]  Where is he?
[7570.10s -> 7576.34s]  So...
[7576.34s -> 7577.62s]  Oh, don't, dude.
[7577.62s -> 7578.42s]  Don't scare me like that.
[7578.42s -> 7579.54s]  You're pretending to hold a weapon.
[7579.54s -> 7581.30s]  He's walking around holding a fake weapon.
[7581.30s -> 7581.94s]  Get out of here.
[7582.58s -> 7595.51s]  All right.
[7595.51s -> 7599.11s]  Get out.
[7599.11s -> 7599.59s]  Go for it.
[7609.96s -> 7611.08s]  Let's get out of here.
[7611.08s -> 7611.88s]  Everybody, get out.
[7612.52s -> 7613.56s]  Everybody, get out.
[7614.20s -> 7617.10s]  It's everywhere for himself.
[7617.66s -> 7622.70s]  Where's the guard quarters?
[7626.62s -> 7627.74s]  No, we can take them.
[7627.74s -> 7628.46s]  We can take them.
[7629.02s -> 7629.82s]  We can take them.
[7630.46s -> 7651.72s]  I don't know why I did that.
[7651.72s -> 7653.32s]  I just pressed it like an idiot.
[7653.32s -> 7653.64s]  Okay.
[7653.64s -> 7654.52s]  All right, all right, all right, all right.
[7654.52s -> 7655.56s]  Where's the guard's quarters?
[7655.56s -> 7662.92s]  Over here.
[7662.92s -> 7663.40s]  You all right?
[7663.96s -> 7665.53s]  You're smart.
[7665.53s -> 7666.25s]  This is a smart one.
[7671.14s -> 7672.02s]  You need a weapon.
[7672.02s -> 7673.06s]  You don't have a weapon.
[7673.06s -> 7673.94s]  You don't have a weapon.
[7674.58s -> 7674.98s]  You don't...
[7674.98s -> 7676.34s]  You need to get away from me, though.
[7676.34s -> 7677.38s]  You have to leave me alone.
[7678.95s -> 7679.59s]  Yes.
[7679.59s -> 7680.71s]  It's good to see you.
[7680.71s -> 7681.51s]  Very nice to meet you.
[7681.51s -> 7681.91s]  This is...
[7681.91s -> 7682.23s]  Okay.
[7682.87s -> 7683.51s]  Save me.
[7684.23s -> 7685.51s]  There's someone here.
[7685.51s -> 7686.15s]  Stay with me.
[7687.19s -> 7687.75s]  Ooh.
[7687.75s -> 7688.39s]  Stay with me.
[7694.74s -> 7705.13s]  I just let him out of prison.
[7705.13s -> 7706.57s]  I just broke him out of prison.
[7706.57s -> 7708.01s]  And he's screaming assassin.
[7712.31s -> 7712.71s]  I'm sorry.
[7712.71s -> 7713.43s]  That was fucked up.
[7720.76s -> 7722.66s]  All right.
[7722.66s -> 7723.30s]  Where...
[7723.30s -> 7725.70s]  I got a barracks in officer's quarters.
[7725.70s -> 7726.26s]  Wait, what?
[7726.98s -> 7734.42s]  I can write on this?
[7734.42s -> 7752.30s]  I gotta head this way.
[7752.30s -> 7757.78s]  So I have to go down.
[7757.78s -> 7760.18s]  And then across.
[7760.18s -> 7761.30s]  I don't know where the hell I'm going.
[7761.30s -> 7762.42s]  I need to drink a health potion, though.
[7763.06s -> 7768.81s]  Officers quarters.
[7768.81s -> 7770.33s]  Officers cell block one.
[7770.33s -> 7771.13s]  Officers quarters.
[7771.69s -> 7777.00s]  All right.
[7777.00s -> 7777.80s]  Cell block one.
[7778.44s -> 7779.96s]  Which is across the way.
[7782.52s -> 7798.57s]  Link, can I just go through this door?
[7801.61s -> 7810.94s]  All right.
[7810.94s -> 7811.98s]  Cell block three.
[7812.54s -> 7813.66s]  I gotta get to cell block one.
[7815.21s -> 7817.29s]  Cell block one was on the other side.
[7820.09s -> 7820.89s]  Oh, shit.
[7821.85s -> 7822.57s]  And how...
[7822.57s -> 7825.21s]  Explain to me how you saw me, you piece of crap.
[7837.08s -> 7848.07s]  Don't hit your head on the ceiling.
[7850.30s -> 7850.94s]  Cell block one.
[7850.94s -> 7851.98s]  One, one, one, one, one, one.
[7861.50s -> 7862.78s]  Leave me the fuck alone.
[7865.14s -> 7865.78s]  Leave me alone.
[7865.78s -> 7866.50s]  This guy chased me.
[7866.50s -> 7867.54s]  What's the aggro range?
[7867.54s -> 7867.94s]  Leave me...
[7867.94s -> 7869.14s]  Get away from me.
[7869.14s -> 7869.86s]  Leave me alone.
[7876.89s -> 7878.97s]  This guy is seriously a superhero.
[7878.97s -> 7879.93s]  Get away from me.
[7880.65s -> 7898.52s]  Why would I even start...
[7915.85s -> 7919.99s]  I know where to go.
[7925.77s -> 7936.73s]  Do no emotion.
[7937.29s -> 7940.60s]  This is a stream sniper.
[7954.62s -> 7955.26s]  No emotion.
[7955.26s -> 7956.06s]  Should I do no emotion?
[7956.06s -> 7956.38s]  I can't...
[7956.38s -> 7957.42s]  I'm just trying to concentrate.
[7957.42s -> 7958.97s]  This game's hard.
[7958.97s -> 7959.69s]  Stop singing.
[7959.69s -> 7960.73s]  Why is everybody singing?
[7960.73s -> 7963.50s]  All right.
[7963.50s -> 7964.14s]  Here we go.
[7964.14s -> 7966.62s]  I don't have somebody chasing me now.
[7966.62s -> 7968.30s]  I can get to cell block one from here.
[7969.10s -> 7974.89s]  It's a scary game.
[7974.89s -> 7975.69s]  It's kind of scary.
[7976.25s -> 7976.49s]  All right.
[7976.49s -> 7976.97s]  Here we go.
[7978.66s -> 7979.30s]  Get through this.
[7982.33s -> 7983.37s]  Wait till it turns off.
[7985.34s -> 7986.94s]  You got like a two second window.
[7986.94s -> 7987.18s]  One.
[7988.74s -> 7989.46s]  Did you see that bait?
[7989.46s -> 7990.02s]  What was that?
[7992.84s -> 7993.16s]  Okay.
[7994.26s -> 7995.22s]  Oh, my goodness.
[7995.22s -> 7995.62s]  I'm fine.
[7996.60s -> 7997.24s]  All right.
[7997.24s -> 7998.28s]  Save it right here.
[7998.28s -> 7999.16s]  Drink a health potion.
[7999.16s -> 7999.64s]  I'm ready to go.
[8001.48s -> 8002.76s]  You just heard me gulp that.
[8003.32s -> 8004.20s]  You just heard me drink.
[8006.66s -> 8007.62s]  You got to be kidding me.
[8015.38s -> 8016.66s]  That would be so scary.
[8018.81s -> 8020.73s]  If you're just in like a pitch black area.
[8022.18s -> 8023.30s]  And all you hear is this.
[8026.81s -> 8036.07s]  Okay.
[8036.07s -> 8036.63s]  Save it here.
[8039.94s -> 8040.82s]  Cell block one.
[8042.38s -> 8043.66s]  And to the barracks.
[8043.66s -> 8053.21s]  All right.
[8053.21s -> 8054.09s]  No more alarm.
[8054.73s -> 8055.45s]  Finally.
[8055.45s -> 8058.10s]  I can take this guy out.
[8059.19s -> 8059.67s]  What happened?
[8059.67s -> 8060.55s]  What's going on?
[8060.55s -> 8061.05s]  What?
[8061.29s -> 8064.52s]  Stay in shadow.
[8064.52s -> 8066.28s]  Did he just turn the alarm back on?
[8067.00s -> 8077.42s]  I think he just got himself stuck.
[8077.42s -> 8079.93s]  All right.
[8079.93s -> 8082.06s]  We're good.
[8082.06s -> 8084.14s]  Cell block one is this way.
[8090.62s -> 8092.22s]  Bring this over here so nobody hears it.
[8092.78s -> 8099.50s]  I got to go get the map.
[8099.50s -> 8107.87s]  Okay.
[8108.43s -> 8108.99s]  Up here.
[8108.99s -> 8110.99s]  Barracks offers his quarters straight ahead.
[8110.99s -> 8113.50s]  I just have to sneak through with the shadows.
[8117.44s -> 8128.32s]  Let's have a good bad gamer neck there for a second.
[8128.32s -> 8137.74s]  Here we go.
[8138.70s -> 8143.15s]  The barracks.
[8143.79s -> 8147.72s]  Hit it again.
[8148.28s -> 8157.74s]  All right.
[8157.74s -> 8158.62s]  Where are we at?
[8158.62s -> 8164.65s]  Is it in here?
[8164.65s -> 8166.01s]  Oh, carpet, carpet, carpet, carpet, carpet.
[8166.01s -> 8171.74s]  I didn't want to pick this.
[8182.75s -> 8183.79s]  Not hidden.
[8183.79s -> 8190.65s]  Who is that?
[8190.65s -> 8191.05s]  Who is that?
[8191.05s -> 8191.53s]  Who is that?
[8191.53s -> 8192.33s]  A prince?
[8192.33s -> 8193.13s]  Who is that guy?
[8204.84s -> 8212.19s]  Got anything on you?
[8212.19s -> 8212.67s]  Oh, shit.
[8212.67s -> 8212.83s]  Nice.
[8212.83s -> 8220.27s]  There's tons of stuff in here.
[8220.27s -> 8220.75s]  All right.
[8220.75s -> 8221.79s]  I'm going to...
[8221.79s -> 8222.83s]  These are all the guards' quarters.
[8227.74s -> 8228.30s]  Knife.
[8228.30s -> 8264.65s]  Give me a knife.
[8264.65s -> 8266.25s]  Looking for the map now.
[8266.25s -> 8267.39s]  Wherever that is.
[8267.39s -> 8267.95s]  Hold on.
[8267.95s -> 8268.99s]  I came in through here.
[8268.99s -> 8277.50s]  How do I not have full health after eating all that?
[8277.50s -> 8278.06s]  All right.
[8278.06s -> 8281.15s]  I explored all the quarters.
[8281.15s -> 8284.65s]  Here we go.
[8284.65s -> 8286.41s]  I don't know who this person was.
[8286.41s -> 8292.57s]  I'm coming.
[8299.16s -> 8300.12s]  I'm going to throw the knife in his neck.
[8300.86s -> 8301.82s]  Can I think I can hit it from here?
[8306.97s -> 8307.37s]  Nope.
[8307.37s -> 8308.09s]  But it don't matter.
[8308.09s -> 8317.84s]  I'll get him.
[8317.84s -> 8319.52s]  He just baited me, but I still hit him in the head.
[8319.52s -> 8320.08s]  Okay.
[8320.08s -> 8331.18s]  I don't even know who this person is.
[8331.18s -> 8332.84s]  Does he have a key or something?
[8332.84s -> 8333.56s]  It doesn't look like it.
[8333.56s -> 8338.35s]  He's throwing a handle first.
[8338.35s -> 8339.95s]  It's not going to kill anybody.
[8339.95s -> 8352.19s]  Is somebody walking?
[8352.83s -> 8362.57s]  Where is this map?
[8363.90s -> 8366.14s]  Find the evidence locker in the tree...
[8366.14s -> 8367.42s]  Evidence locker in the...
[8367.42s -> 8368.46s]  Am I going too far?
[8369.10s -> 8375.92s]  This guy's got magical powers.
[8381.96s -> 8397.21s]  There's a lot of talking, but he's got magic powers.
[8398.09s -> 8405.90s]  Is this a spell book?
[8406.46s -> 8410.36s]  When I was cold, thou taught of hearth in roof beam.
[8410.36s -> 8413.32s]  When I was hungry, thou taught of pot and cauldron.
[8413.32s -> 8416.04s]  When I was beset by foes, thou taught of spear and shield.
[8416.84s -> 8420.52s]  Thy hammer pounds thy nail, holds the roof beam.
[8420.52s -> 8422.76s]  Thy hammer strikes the iron, shapes the cauldron.
[8422.76s -> 8425.16s]  Thy hammer in my hand, unto my foes.
[8427.72s -> 8429.08s]  I think I had fire powers.
[8430.81s -> 8432.01s]  These magic potions?
[8434.94s -> 8437.05s]  Okay.
[8437.05s -> 8438.01s]  Wait a minute.
[8438.01s -> 8442.67s]  Do I need to bring a hammer here in front of the door?
[8452.00s -> 8452.64s]  I hope not.
[8455.60s -> 8456.96s]  Still walking around here.
[8456.96s -> 8458.48s]  Hopefully I'm able to get to the next part.
[8466.17s -> 8467.13s]  What are these hammers?
[8467.77s -> 8478.56s]  Oh, I found a hammer.
[8490.97s -> 8491.47s]  What?
[8501.74s -> 8502.70s]  Holy shit, diamonds.
[8505.15s -> 8506.27s]  Oh, I got it.
[8506.27s -> 8509.40s]  All right.
[8509.40s -> 8511.61s]  I got it.
[8511.61s -> 8515.77s]  It was right there.
[8515.77s -> 8516.49s]  All right.
[8516.49s -> 8518.12s]  I couldn't save Cuddy.
[8518.12s -> 8519.08s]  I think that's scripted though.
[8538.14s -> 8544.36s]  The man-fools piled rock on rocks and raised a treacy roof.
[8544.36s -> 8551.87s]  Hammer saws tear the skin of goodsy wood and laughs at the woodsy lord.
[8551.87s -> 8558.83s]  And when learns of the lord of this, he sends his beasties to the man-fools
[8558.83s -> 8561.71s]  who attacks and hammer saws their useless flesh.
[8562.35s -> 8565.64s]  And build him a house of thy rotting skins.
[8566.52s -> 8570.36s]  I was pissed at Cuddy for a good one.
[8570.36s -> 8574.03s]  But hey, I gotta like stand up.
[8574.03s -> 8575.63s]  I like him for what the hammers did to him.
[8575.63s -> 8576.91s]  It sort of like stuck to him.
[8576.91s -> 8580.19s]  So I decided to go after that horn that Felix talked about.
[8580.19s -> 8582.51s]  Not like I had a whole lot of choice, really.
[8582.51s -> 8583.87s]  The rent is due.
[8583.87s -> 8585.04s]  The landlord's...
[8585.04s -> 8585.76s]  Manslide!
[8586.64s -> 8587.28s]  Man-filth!
[8587.28s -> 8589.68s]  The map's pretty specific about where the entrance is.
[8590.48s -> 8592.96s]  Too bad it's not as clear about where the horn is.
[8594.08s -> 8596.08s]  Felix did some scrounging before he left
[8596.08s -> 8598.80s]  and his notes say the horn is in the tomb of some nobles.
[8599.44s -> 8601.04s]  The Aquintus family.
[8602.08s -> 8603.52s]  Guess I'll just have to explore.
[8605.31s -> 8606.19s]  Felix.
[8606.19s -> 8607.39s]  Always helpful.
[8607.39s -> 8610.03s]  Also said that the catacombs are supposed to be haunted.
[8610.91s -> 8611.23s]  Great.
[8611.23s -> 8614.19s]  I think I'll go make some inquiries about where a heretic like me
[8614.19s -> 8615.63s]  can get some holy water.
[8616.83s -> 8618.67s]  I'll always go prepared.
[8618.67s -> 8619.87s]  Filthy man thing.
[8622.03s -> 8623.23s]  Uh, should I go pee?
[8623.23s -> 8624.03s]  Should we take a pee break?
[8624.67s -> 8630.60s]  Search through the ancient bone hoard and procure the legendary horn of Quintus.
[8630.60s -> 8633.20s]  Let me just get a good save point here.
[8633.20s -> 8634.32s]  Oh wait, let me spend some money.
[8637.77s -> 8639.13s]  These are pretty useful.
[8639.13s -> 8639.85s]  So I want some.
[8642.36s -> 8643.96s]  That's way too expensive.
[8643.96s -> 8645.88s]  Never mind, I'd rather have the alarm get set off
[8645.88s -> 8646.92s]  than spend that much money.
[8649.40s -> 8650.68s]  Water arrows.
[8650.68s -> 8653.13s]  50 rope arrows.
[8653.13s -> 8653.45s]  Okay.
[8654.17s -> 8656.14s]  I want health.
[8656.86s -> 8657.98s]  It's so much more important to me.
[8659.20s -> 8659.92s]  Holy water.
[8659.92s -> 8662.40s]  This vial of hammer-sanctified liquid.
[8662.88s -> 8665.84s]  It's potent protection against the undead when used on your water arrows.
[8665.84s -> 8666.56s]  I have a few of them.
[8669.12s -> 8670.16s]  Maybe I'll get more of these, yeah.
[8670.88s -> 8674.33s]  Okay, I don't want to...
[8674.33s -> 8675.05s]  I gotta be careful.
[8675.69s -> 8679.07s]  The money's about previous missions.
[8679.07s -> 8679.71s]  That's pretty cool.
[8680.27s -> 8681.77s]  This game's fun.
[8681.77s -> 8682.25s]  I like this game.
[8688.52s -> 8689.56s]  I'm gonna save it right here.
[8689.56s -> 8690.68s]  I'm gonna take a quick pee break.
[8691.24s -> 8694.48s]  I'll be right back.
[8697.07s -> 8698.19s]  You know, it's not...
[8698.19s -> 8701.31s]  I know it's like January 10th or whatever.
[8701.31s -> 8703.93s]  How about the Christmas one one more time?
[8703.93s -> 8704.65s]  What do you think?
[8704.65s -> 8706.32s]  Christmas one one more time?
[8710.86s -> 8711.74s]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[8711.74s -> 8712.94s]  Yeah.
[8712.94s -> 8713.58s]  All right.
[8713.58s -> 8715.29s]  I'll see you guys in two minutes.
[8715.29s -> 8716.49s]  I'm just gonna go pee real quick.
[8717.29s -> 8717.93s]  Grab some water.
[8718.49s -> 8732.44s]  See you guys in a minute.
[8732.44s -> 8733.16s]  Oops.
[8733.16s -> 8734.12s]  All right, we're good.
[8734.12s -> 9014.70s]  Beer B.
[9014.70s -> 9015.58s]  I have returned.
[9021.10s -> 9022.30s]  How are you doing?
[9022.30s -> 9026.49s]  Are you a Raiders fan ever since you went to Vegas?
[9029.63s -> 9031.55s]  I never really was a football fan to begin with.
[9031.55s -> 9036.01s]  I think it's cool.
[9036.01s -> 9040.32s]  I really kind of feel bad for Oakland though.
[9040.32s -> 9042.80s]  Because Vegas took the Raiders.
[9043.60s -> 9045.60s]  And Vegas might take the A's too.
[9047.64s -> 9049.00s]  So that's kind of...
[9049.00s -> 9051.61s]  I feel bad for Oakland.
[9055.56s -> 9056.84s]  Oh, we're doing sports talk now.
[9057.40s -> 9068.64s]  This is a prime 90s PC boomer game.
[9068.64s -> 9069.92s]  How did you not play it yet?
[9070.64s -> 9072.48s]  I'm telling you, it's been installed for like years.
[9076.20s -> 9078.52s]  I just had to decide on a day to do it.
[9079.56s -> 9080.84s]  And I just put it in the poll.
[9081.56s -> 9084.00s]  All right, let's do it.
[9084.64s -> 9087.48s]  Did you wash your hands?
[9087.48s -> 9088.60s]  I always wash my hands.
[9090.41s -> 9090.81s]  Always.
[9091.45s -> 9099.77s]  Are you gonna do Thief 2 and Thief 3 as well?
[9099.77s -> 9100.41s]  I don't know.
[9102.08s -> 9103.28s]  That's actually a pretty good question.
[9103.28s -> 9105.12s]  It really depends on how much I enjoy this one.
[9105.12s -> 9106.80s]  Which so far I think it's pretty fun.
[9106.88s -> 9111.21s]  Bring the scary music back up.
[9113.63s -> 9114.35s]  Back to this.
[9119.92s -> 9120.64s]  Thief 2.
[9120.64s -> 9122.40s]  Thief 2 is this but better.
[9124.11s -> 9125.72s]  Okay.
[9125.72s -> 9126.76s]  Reboot is trash.
[9126.76s -> 9127.32s]  Don't play it.
[9128.49s -> 9130.09s]  I kind of wanted to play this one anyways.
[9130.81s -> 9136.27s]  Add it to the list of old PC boomer games.
[9136.27s -> 9136.83s]  That's right.
[9136.83s -> 9138.19s]  Basecam or Outrage.
[9141.85s -> 9142.65s]  Wait a minute.
[9142.65s -> 9150.09s]  All right, so this one...
[9150.09s -> 9150.65s]  What are we gonna do?
[9152.38s -> 9153.98s]  Find the Horn of Quintus.
[9154.94s -> 9156.06s]  That's all the info I got.
[9156.06s -> 9157.10s]  And I have nothing else to go on.
[9157.66s -> 9158.62s]  This guy's gonna get up.
[9159.50s -> 9160.22s]  Yep.
[9160.22s -> 9162.14s]  Who cares though?
[9162.14s -> 9162.64s]  What?
[9163.85s -> 9164.49s]  Do I really care?
[9164.49s -> 9164.81s]  Just...
[9164.81s -> 9165.85s]  I'm just gonna go.
[9165.85s -> 9166.09s]  Right?
[9166.09s -> 9166.89s]  Like he's gonna...
[9167.45s -> 9169.29s]  That was just a jump scare that didn't happen.
[9169.29s -> 9172.51s]  Kind of creepy.
[9172.51s -> 9173.23s]  All right.
[9173.23s -> 9177.79s]  Do I have any notes?
[9179.31s -> 9180.51s]  Mario family.
[9180.51s -> 9181.63s]  Halls of Echoing.
[9181.63s -> 9182.51s]  Repose.
[9182.51s -> 9183.47s]  Hammerite crypts.
[9184.33s -> 9185.37s]  Quintus family.
[9185.37s -> 9186.97s]  So we gotta go down.
[9186.97s -> 9188.09s]  Down and north.
[9188.09s -> 9193.12s]  I guess.
[9193.12s -> 9199.08s]  Do you die from this?
[9210.56s -> 9211.04s]  Watch it.
[9213.07s -> 9213.55s]  I need...
[9213.55s -> 9215.07s]  Should I kill this thing with holy water?
[9215.07s -> 9215.79s]  Probably, right?
[9223.45s -> 9224.25s]  Fire!
[9224.25s -> 9230.28s]  Fire!
[9230.28s -> 9230.92s]  Anybody else quick?
[9230.92s -> 9231.96s]  I only have 19 seconds.
[9231.96s -> 9233.00s]  Anybody else down here?
[9233.00s -> 9242.52s]  Oh, there's a goblet though.
[9242.52s -> 9242.84s]  Nice.
[9242.84s -> 9246.46s]  All right.
[9246.46s -> 9247.74s]  Oh, shit!
[9247.74s -> 9248.30s]  No!
[9248.30s -> 9249.26s]  That's bad.
[9249.26s -> 9250.78s]  I thought I was touching this.
[9250.78s -> 9251.90s]  I have to reload.
[9251.90s -> 9255.44s]  I thought I was touching...
[9255.44s -> 9256.16s]  Okay.
[9256.16s -> 9257.04s]  Sorry about that.
[9257.04s -> 9265.96s]  I'm an idiot.
[9266.68s -> 9277.04s]  All right.
[9277.04s -> 9277.52s]  Here we go.
[9277.52s -> 9278.48s]  Third time's the charm.
[9278.48s -> 9286.75s]  Shoot the arrow, please.
[9287.55s -> 9292.22s]  Anybody else down here?
[9293.34s -> 9293.98s]  I don't think so.
[9299.20s -> 9299.92s]  15 seconds.
[9299.92s -> 9300.56s]  Any other enemies?
[9300.56s -> 9301.04s]  Come on.
[9301.04s -> 9309.44s]  That's weird.
[9309.44s -> 9312.12s]  Three seconds.
[9312.12s -> 9312.44s]  Nothing.
[9312.44s -> 9312.92s]  All right.
[9312.92s -> 9319.61s]  So I guess I'm just gonna keep going.
[9319.61s -> 9320.73s]  Argoil wall?
[9320.73s -> 9323.28s]  All right.
[9323.28s -> 9327.40s]  Diving board.
[9327.40s -> 9336.09s]  What are your thoughts on...
[9336.09s -> 9337.21s]  Alaris.
[9337.21s -> 9343.60s]  Alaris.
[9344.46s -> 9345.26s]  Does that mean anything?
[9345.26s -> 9353.15s]  All right.
[9353.15s -> 9362.43s]  I'm still in the upper vaults.
[9362.43s -> 9363.07s]  Ooh.
[9363.07s -> 9365.58s]  Very useful.
[9365.58s -> 9366.06s]  All right.
[9366.06s -> 9367.02s]  I got 30 seconds now.
[9367.02s -> 9369.23s]  I'm gonna be some monsters right here.
[9369.23s -> 9370.11s]  Guaranteed.
[9370.11s -> 9373.39s]  Crap door.
[9373.39s -> 9386.96s]  Don't stand on that.
[9386.96s -> 9387.60s]  Oh.
[9387.60s -> 9390.56s]  I thought it was gonna fall.
[9390.56s -> 9407.04s]  Is this gonna be over my head?
[9407.04s -> 9408.80s]  All right.
[9408.80s -> 9409.44s]  Got it.
[9409.44s -> 9410.16s]  So, wait.
[9410.16s -> 9416.00s]  Will this shoot over my head?
[9416.00s -> 9423.60s]  It is.
[9423.60s -> 9424.16s]  Okay.
[9424.16s -> 9428.20s]  Is this just a depressing box?
[9428.20s -> 9434.91s]  I think so.
[9434.91s -> 9435.07s]  Okay.
[9435.07s -> 9438.86s]  I thought it was gonna fall.
[9438.86s -> 9440.22s]  Well, that's why I need the holy water.
[9440.22s -> 9444.70s]  Gotta go back and get it free.
[9444.70s -> 9446.70s]  All right.
[9446.70s -> 9447.26s]  Here we go.
[9447.26s -> 9447.98s]  Save it.
[9447.98s -> 9450.54s]  And...
[9450.54s -> 9451.18s]  All right.
[9451.18s -> 9467.77s]  Well, I got you.
[9468.25s -> 9474.97s]  Grab it.
[9474.97s -> 9475.77s]  All right.
[9475.77s -> 9476.73s]  Nothing else in here?
[9476.73s -> 9481.20s]  Why is the body exploding so funny?
[9481.20s -> 9481.52s]  I don't know.
[9481.52s -> 9482.16s]  It just is.
[9482.16s -> 9483.90s]  Nothing about it.
[9483.90s -> 9492.22s]  Upper vaults north.
[9492.22s -> 9496.48s]  Should I go down here?
[9496.48s -> 9501.04s]  Or deeper into the crypts?
[9501.04s -> 9501.68s]  What do you think?
[9501.68s -> 9503.95s]  How is it not funny?
[9503.95s -> 9504.19s]  I know.
[9504.19s -> 9504.91s]  It just is.
[9504.91s -> 9509.64s]  Is there any other holy water things over here?
[9509.64s -> 9511.60s]  These are both gonna get up.
[9511.60s -> 9512.32s]  Guaranteed.
[9512.32s -> 9517.31s]  Let me just see if this...
[9517.31s -> 9518.51s]  There might be a well right here.
[9518.51s -> 9519.76s]  No, there's not.
[9519.76s -> 9520.00s]  All right.
[9520.00s -> 9521.69s]  Well, do I need to kill these things
[9521.69s -> 9522.65s]  or can I just run away?
[9522.65s -> 9526.01s]  Yeah.
[9526.01s -> 9526.97s]  There's no reason to.
[9526.97s -> 9527.53s]  Just leave.
[9527.53s -> 9528.56s]  Just leave.
[9528.56s -> 9528.96s]  All right.
[9528.96s -> 9534.86s]  Let's go in here.
[9534.86s -> 9535.66s]  Neck light?
[9535.74s -> 9539.04s]  I mean, neck light.
[9539.04s -> 9544.20s]  Have I ever worn an apron before?
[9545.80s -> 9547.40s]  Maybe when I was barbecuing.
[9548.62s -> 9550.06s]  I was probably barbecuing somewhere
[9550.06s -> 9551.42s]  thinking it was funny.
[9551.42s -> 9553.66s]  Like, oh, here I am, the chef.
[9553.66s -> 9555.92s]  Nobody wants to be that guy, by the way.
[9555.92s -> 9559.04s]  You know how much panic I have
[9559.04s -> 9562.96s]  if I ever am the guy that is in charge of the grill?
[9562.96s -> 9564.24s]  The whole time, I'm just like,
[9567.16s -> 9568.04s]  everyone's gonna get poisoned.
[9570.17s -> 9571.05s]  Is that cooked enough?
[9571.05s -> 9571.77s]  I'm gonna kill somebody.
[9572.49s -> 9576.67s]  Is that too red in the middle?
[9576.67s -> 9577.47s]  Someone's gonna die.
[9577.47s -> 9578.35s]  Someone's gonna die.
[9578.35s -> 9579.39s]  Someone's gonna get too sick.
[9579.39s -> 9579.95s]  No, just me.
[9579.95s -> 9581.55s]  And then I overcook everything.
[9583.84s -> 9584.64s]  I have to kill this guy.
[9589.98s -> 9590.62s]  That's raw.
[9590.62s -> 9592.06s]  And those chicken wings are raw.
[9592.06s -> 9594.12s]  I can't serve them.
[9594.12s -> 9596.84s]  And then I always, if I'm ever in charge of...
[9596.84s -> 9597.72s]  Anytime you cook anything,
[9598.91s -> 9600.43s]  I always want to eat it first.
[9601.66s -> 9604.62s]  I'm gonna be my own tester for my own food, right?
[9605.64s -> 9606.20s]  You missed?
[9608.72s -> 9611.52s]  So like, the food's not ready yet.
[9612.24s -> 9613.84s]  Hey, when do you think the food's gonna be ready?
[9613.84s -> 9618.75s]  Well, maybe 20 minutes.
[9618.75s -> 9619.23s]  We'll see.
[9620.12s -> 9623.56s]  Because if I get sick, then I know, right?
[9627.76s -> 9628.72s]  So nobody eat it.
[9632.30s -> 9632.94s]  What was even in here?
[9636.68s -> 9638.12s]  You just ate raw food.
[9638.12s -> 9640.12s]  No, I'm just saying, I always want to make sure
[9640.12s -> 9642.83s]  I don't make anybody sick or anything.
[9642.83s -> 9644.27s]  And it can be really...
[9644.27s -> 9644.91s]  Where am I?
[9647.71s -> 9648.59s]  Wait, did I just go in a circle?
[9650.96s -> 9652.80s]  Whenever you have a guy at the grill
[9652.80s -> 9655.52s]  and you have like 15 hamburger patties on there,
[9656.76s -> 9657.24s]  it can be...
[9657.80s -> 9658.52s]  I don't know.
[9658.52s -> 9660.52s]  You can't really focus on one patty.
[9661.08s -> 9663.21s]  So you have to really make sure
[9663.21s -> 9664.89s]  that everything is cooked correctly
[9664.89s -> 9665.45s]  and everything's...
[9666.25s -> 9667.77s]  Why are you guys saying neck light?
[9668.33s -> 9673.16s]  I don't get this.
[9673.16s -> 9675.60s]  What are you doing?
[9675.60s -> 9676.40s]  Back in the water?
[9676.96s -> 9681.45s]  Put the light on your neck.
[9681.45s -> 9682.33s]  It's not gonna fit.
[9685.53s -> 9695.87s]  Okay, no, no, I gotta go back down.
[9695.87s -> 9696.67s]  No, you guys are gonna...
[9696.67s -> 9697.87s]  This is gonna turn into a cartoon.
[9698.43s -> 9703.29s]  Go this way?
[9703.29s -> 9705.36s]  Do I have enough breath to do this?
[9705.36s -> 9713.24s]  Where is this taking me?
[9713.24s -> 9713.96s]  It'll fit, trust me.
[9713.96s -> 9715.00s]  I'm an engineer.
[9715.00s -> 9722.94s]  Am I going?
[9722.94s -> 9731.52s]  Leave it open so you know where you've been.
[9732.08s -> 9734.25s]  Where the hell am I supposed to go?
[9734.89s -> 9739.05s]  All right, I went right and down,
[9739.05s -> 9740.65s]  so now I'm just gonna go over?
[9740.65s -> 9745.42s]  What do I hear?
[9745.42s -> 9746.06s]  Sleigh bells.
[9746.70s -> 9759.20s]  This is kind of creepy.
[9759.20s -> 9760.24s]  All right, wait, I see.
[9760.24s -> 9762.65s]  I see the cannon.
[9762.65s -> 9764.99s]  Yeah, you think you're so funny.
[9764.99s -> 9766.46s]  Nope, sorry.
[9775.72s -> 9776.60s]  I think I just drank all my potions.
[9776.60s -> 9777.24s]  No, I didn't.
[9777.24s -> 9784.46s]  Okay, so how do I get through here?
[9784.46s -> 9790.11s]  You promised all of things.
[9790.11s -> 9791.23s]  I did it in the very beginning of the stream
[9791.23s -> 9792.27s]  and it was stupid.
[9792.27s -> 9797.98s]  I couldn't even get three on my hand.
[9797.98s -> 9798.54s]  You...
[9798.54s -> 9810.40s]  All right, we're going down to wherever like...
[9816.11s -> 9817.07s]  We're going down here.
[9817.07s -> 9837.63s]  Oh, don't touch that, right?
[9837.63s -> 9838.99s]  Is this gonna do something if I touch it?
[9838.99s -> 9843.28s]  This looks lower, right?
[9843.28s -> 9844.16s]  There's a lip here.
[9844.16s -> 9845.28s]  Does that mean anything?
[9845.28s -> 9848.86s]  Washrooms.
[9848.86s -> 9853.95s]  I can't pick them up.
[9853.95s -> 9875.12s]  This feels like Castle Gryphonsteed.
[9875.12s -> 9877.04s]  What is that thing?
[9877.04s -> 9878.64s]  What is that thing?
[9878.64s -> 9883.53s]  I gotta try to drop this on his head.
[9883.53s -> 9890.83s]  I'm by again.
[9890.83s -> 9891.23s]  Does this even...
[9891.23s -> 9909.20s]  Can you even hurt enemies with this stuff?
[9909.36s -> 9925.31s]  I don't like those sounds.
[9925.31s -> 9926.03s]  Relax, shut up.
[9926.03s -> 9935.12s]  Does this hurt?
[9935.12s -> 9941.02s]  This looks like one of those guys
[9941.02s -> 9943.34s]  in those inflatable T-Rex costumes.
[9943.34s -> 9966.67s]  It's like a pig and a...
[9966.67s -> 9967.63s]  I don't want to hurt it.
[9967.63s -> 9968.03s]  I don't...
[9968.03s -> 9969.79s]  I wish I could just say I'm not gonna hurt you,
[9969.79s -> 9984.33s]  but it's not gonna let me pass.
[9984.33s -> 9984.89s]  Jump!
[9984.89s -> 9996.78s]  I'm sorry, I had to.
[9996.78s -> 9999.84s]  It's because you threw a boulder at it.
[9999.84s -> 10000.48s]  I don't know.
[10000.48s -> 10001.92s]  It was trying to get me.
[10001.92s -> 10011.82s]  I'm coloring...
[10011.82s -> 10013.34s]  I'm coloring a cat coloring book.
[10013.34s -> 10014.54s]  What's your favorite cat?
[10014.54s -> 10015.96s]  I don't know.
[10015.96s -> 10016.84s]  I think cats are cool.
[10016.84s -> 10024.44s]  Oh shit, here comes the whole family.
[10027.21s -> 10028.62s]  Okay.
[10028.62s -> 10029.58s]  Where am I?
[10029.66s -> 10035.13s]  Why is there a little arrow scratched over here?
[10035.13s -> 10035.61s]  What?
[10035.61s -> 10042.06s]  I'm gonna follow the arrow.
[10042.06s -> 10048.22s]  I'm kind of scared to do this.
[10048.22s -> 10062.48s]  Okay.
[10062.48s -> 10062.72s]  Where...
[10062.72s -> 10063.92s]  I still don't know where I am.
[10063.92s -> 10072.52s]  I think I made it.
[10072.52s -> 10078.56s]  Is this it?
[10078.56s -> 10079.04s]  Watch out.
[10079.04s -> 10080.08s]  There's all these things everywhere.
[10080.08s -> 10080.72s]  Be careful.
[10080.72s -> 10088.44s]  If I crouch, it's fine, right?
[10088.44s -> 10091.36s]  Yeah, just stay crouched.
[10091.36s -> 10091.68s]  Ah!
[10091.68s -> 10092.08s]  The back...
[10092.72s -> 10096.44s]  B-boom!
[10096.44s -> 10097.24s]  This is dead.
[10098.75s -> 10106.08s]  Maybe right in the back of that.
[10106.08s -> 10107.12s]  Don't push that down.
[10107.12s -> 10109.55s]  All right, we got cheese.
[10109.55s -> 10110.59s]  Excuse me?
[10110.59s -> 10111.07s]  What?
[10111.07s -> 10118.40s]  He's right.
[10118.40s -> 10119.20s]  Bedroll?
[10119.20s -> 10129.93s]  What's this stuff?
[10129.93s -> 10131.05s]  Is dinosaur teeth or something?
[10131.05s -> 10131.77s]  What are those?
[10131.77s -> 10141.31s]  Speed potion.
[10141.31s -> 10143.64s]  Fire arrow is...
[10143.64s -> 10144.28s]  Oh, nice.
[10144.28s -> 10144.92s]  All right.
[10144.92s -> 10145.32s]  Cool.
[10145.32s -> 10170.48s]  All right, be careful here getting out.
[10170.48s -> 10173.63s]  All right, nice.
[10173.63s -> 10174.51s]  That got me that.
[10174.51s -> 10175.47s]  So now I gotta go the other way.
[10175.47s -> 10177.36s]  All right.
[10177.36s -> 10178.88s]  Can you throw up on stream, chat?
[10178.88s -> 10180.08s]  No, I'm not gonna throw up on stream.
[10180.08s -> 10181.36s]  Ha ha, vomit's all over the place.
[10182.00s -> 10185.00s]  That you thought it was funny?
[10185.00s -> 10192.49s]  Okay.
[10192.49s -> 10195.69s]  So now I gotta take these...
[10195.69s -> 10196.57s]  I gotta change pants.
[10196.57s -> 10210.59s]  I probably don't understand the concept here of climbing.
[10210.59s -> 10211.47s]  I think you just have to hold it.
[10217.07s -> 10222.52s]  I gotta be ready.
[10222.52s -> 10223.56s]  All over the place here.
[10223.56s -> 10224.04s]  Where...
[10224.04s -> 10225.64s]  Yeah, where am I actually going?
[10225.64s -> 10236.04s]  Down...
[10236.04s -> 10236.76s]  Okay.
[10236.76s -> 10239.68s]  There's dinosaurs down here.
[10239.68s -> 10241.26s]  I don't want...
[10241.26s -> 10243.18s]  I want to try to avoid them if I can.
[10243.18s -> 10247.84s]  Fire arrows on the dinosaurs?
[10257.31s -> 10258.11s]  Wait, did I kill that?
[10258.11s -> 10273.16s]  No, I didn't.
[10273.16s -> 10274.60s]  Where am I supposed to go here?
[10274.60s -> 10277.68s]  Let's go up.
[10277.68s -> 10287.68s]  They're not gonna get up, right?
[10287.68s -> 10288.24s]  They're dead?
[10288.24s -> 10336.80s]  This is such a maze.
[10336.80s -> 10338.00s]  Ooh.
[10338.00s -> 10338.88s]  That's it?
[10338.88s -> 10340.57s]  Are you kidding me?
[10340.57s -> 10341.29s]  That's it?
[10341.29s -> 10347.55s]  Why are you so mad?
[10347.55s -> 10351.56s]  I'm not.
[10351.56s -> 10352.20s]  Eat the shrooms?
[10352.20s -> 10353.56s]  I think they're just light shrooms.
[10353.56s -> 10355.16s]  I don't think they're actual shroom shrooms.
[10355.16s -> 10356.04s]  I don't think I can eat them.
[10356.04s -> 10361.66s]  I gotta turn this up.
[10361.66s -> 10363.18s]  People saying, follow the music.
[10363.18s -> 10377.47s]  That was a pig.
[10377.47s -> 10379.07s]  That was clearly a pig.
[10379.07s -> 10379.63s]  That was that...
[10381.15s -> 10382.43s]  You know that pig sound?
[10382.43s -> 10383.71s]  The default pig sound?
[10383.71s -> 10396.68s]  All right, up here?
[10396.68s -> 10406.97s]  That's why I don't put the two goddamn headphones in.
[10409.29s -> 10410.25s]  Get up!
[10410.25s -> 10415.42s]  Climb up here.
[10415.42s -> 10419.13s]  Oh, now I'm back here.
[10419.13s -> 10424.62s]  All right, get away from me.
[10431.32s -> 10432.96s]  Shit.
[10432.96s -> 10442.64s]  Shit.
[10442.64s -> 10453.98s]  Oh, get away from me.
[10454.54s -> 10455.50s]  I'm gonna die.
[10455.50s -> 10457.26s]  I'm gonna die.
[10457.26s -> 10458.06s]  I'm gonna die.
[10458.86s -> 10459.90s]  You gotta be...
[10459.90s -> 10460.86s]  How did he get up here?
[10460.86s -> 10461.66s]  How did they get up here?
[10461.66s -> 10462.78s]  They can't get up here.
[10462.78s -> 10465.04s]  I missed again.
[10465.04s -> 10467.04s]  I missed again and I went all the way to the back.
[10467.04s -> 10468.00s]  I'm gonna die right now.
[10478.49s -> 10480.01s]  I can't believe that just happened.
[10480.01s -> 10480.81s]  I can't believe it.
[10481.37s -> 10486.04s]  You've gotta be kidding me.
[10486.04s -> 10487.08s]  I don't even know where the save is.
[10489.37s -> 10490.01s]  Not that bad.
[10491.77s -> 10492.97s]  How did it miss?
[10492.97s -> 10494.73s]  There were three in the...
[10494.73s -> 10496.65s]  And all my field of vision.
[10496.65s -> 10503.63s]  That's so unfortunate.
[10503.63s -> 10512.33s]  Oh, well.
[10512.33s -> 10513.77s]  You got so much on my mouth.
[10513.77s -> 10518.51s]  Go change your pants and I'll be all right.
[10518.51s -> 10519.87s]  That's a worst gamer moment.
[10519.87s -> 10521.79s]  Uh, I mean, that was bad.
[10521.79s -> 10523.15s]  But that wasn't even my fault though.
[10523.15s -> 10524.11s]  That was such bullshit.
[10525.76s -> 10526.40s]  I...
[10526.40s -> 10527.04s]  You saw...
[10527.04s -> 10528.88s]  It was like the hitbox got weird.
[10528.88s -> 10529.28s]  I...
[10529.28s -> 10530.32s]  It just missed.
[10530.32s -> 10531.84s]  I don't even know how it missed.
[10531.84s -> 10534.01s]  I don't even know where I am right now.
[10534.01s -> 10535.93s]  But I'm just gonna grab onto this and go up.
[10535.93s -> 10537.77s]  And I think I just found it accidentally.
[10537.77s -> 10542.97s]  Did I just find it?
[10546.94s -> 10547.98s]  I just found where I need to go.
[10548.54s -> 10554.48s]  No, I didn't.
[10554.48s -> 10557.47s]  Is it still alive?
[10557.47s -> 10561.96s]  There's a sick McDonald's ceiling.
[10568.40s -> 10569.28s]  It's like not even...
[10569.28s -> 10570.24s]  It's not even close.
[10570.24s -> 10572.80s]  I mean, it's kind of close but not really...
[10572.80s -> 10574.32s]  Not enough for you to say that.
[10574.32s -> 10584.25s]  I don't think there's anything here.
[10584.25s -> 10585.85s]  All right, I gotta get through that.
[10585.85s -> 10589.08s]  There's nothing else here I can do.
[10589.08s -> 10590.12s]  Can I take something?
[10590.12s -> 10590.76s]  Push something?
[10590.76s -> 10591.26s]  No.
[10592.92s -> 10593.56s]  Secret.
[10593.56s -> 10597.45s]  It returns into the Joker.
[10605.87s -> 10606.35s]  Wait a minute.
[10622.68s -> 10624.04s]  Works on monsters.
[10625.07s -> 10625.71s]  That...
[10625.71s -> 10626.59s]  Good to know.
[10626.59s -> 10628.51s]  Very good to know that the...
[10629.40s -> 10640.27s]  The little bludgeoner works on huge monsters.
[10640.27s -> 10640.99s]  All right.
[10640.99s -> 10642.83s]  Time to get turned around a million times again.
[10644.83s -> 10645.55s]  Follow the music.
[10646.27s -> 10647.39s]  I feel like I was on the right track.
[10655.23s -> 10657.31s]  It works on anything that's alive.
[10657.31s -> 10658.64s]  Good to know.
[10658.64s -> 10659.20s]  That's funny.
[10659.84s -> 10661.92s]  Yep.
[10661.92s -> 10662.96s]  I remember getting the jewel here.
[10663.60s -> 10669.10s]  Follow the music.
[10669.66s -> 10672.20s]  Put in both headphones.
[10672.20s -> 10673.08s]  I hate doing that.
[10673.64s -> 10675.10s]  I hate it.
[10675.10s -> 10675.74s]  I don't like it.
[10677.63s -> 10678.91s]  It's too immersive.
[10678.91s -> 10699.15s]  What's wrong with being immersed?
[10699.15s -> 10700.67s]  I'm not aware of my surroundings.
[10700.67s -> 10714.38s]  I don't hear any music.
[10714.38s -> 10714.62s]  All right.
[10714.62s -> 10716.86s]  I gotta start burning this into memory here.
[10716.86s -> 10720.38s]  Oddwatches skip.
[10720.38s -> 10721.34s]  Don't skip.
[10721.34s -> 10722.38s]  You need to help me.
[10722.38s -> 10726.76s]  All right.
[10726.76s -> 10727.64s]  I hear the music now.
[10728.28s -> 10739.90s]  Okay.
[10739.90s -> 10745.32s]  This is where I got messed up last time.
[10745.32s -> 10756.59s]  I just burped.
[10756.59s -> 10757.55s]  Oh, I thought that was me.
[10758.11s -> 10760.83s]  Shut up.
[10760.83s -> 10761.39s]  Shut up.
[10761.39s -> 10761.87s]  Shut up.
[10761.87s -> 10762.51s]  Shut up.
[10762.51s -> 10767.07s]  Shut up.
[10767.07s -> 10767.87s]  Music.
[10767.87s -> 10769.47s]  Music.
[10769.47s -> 10772.04s]  Come on.
[10772.04s -> 10772.68s]  Get up there.
[10772.68s -> 10779.88s]  How do I get that?
[10779.88s -> 10784.30s]  Why is it saying go down?
[10812.91s -> 10815.21s]  Over there?
[10815.21s -> 10824.76s]  Do I rope arrow over there?
[10824.76s -> 10825.88s]  Music's in this room.
[10825.88s -> 10845.58s]  These zombies or these people?
[10845.58s -> 10857.15s]  It's hard to tell.
[10857.15s -> 10859.39s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[10859.39s -> 10860.59s]  Golden arm.
[10860.59s -> 10861.39s]  Golden arm.
[10861.39s -> 10863.39s]  No.
[10867.40s -> 10867.56s]  All right.
[10867.56s -> 10870.67s]  How do I get out?
[10870.67s -> 10871.31s]  I got a golden arm.
[10872.11s -> 10883.47s]  How do I get out?
[10883.47s -> 10883.87s]  How do I get out?
[10883.87s -> 10886.48s]  How do I get out?
[10886.48s -> 10886.98s]  Oh.
[10919.04s -> 10919.92s]  Eat him, not me.
[10919.92s -> 10921.21s]  Eat him.
[10921.21s -> 10922.09s]  Eat him, not me.
[10922.09s -> 10922.33s]  All right.
[10922.33s -> 10923.21s]  How do I get out of here?
[10923.21s -> 10928.27s]  The horn is somewhere down here.
[10928.27s -> 10928.91s]  Oh, my God.
[10928.91s -> 10930.27s]  I'm actually in the horn room.
[10930.27s -> 10934.57s]  I need to heal.
[10934.57s -> 10935.45s]  Golden arm.
[10935.45s -> 10955.48s]  I was just frozen in fear.
[10955.48s -> 10962.04s]  I couldn't do anything.
[10962.04s -> 10963.32s]  I was just frozen.
[10970.11s -> 10970.91s]  Die.
[10972.12s -> 10973.53s]  I can't.
[10981.74s -> 10983.34s]  Shut up, everybody.
[10983.34s -> 10986.20s]  All right.
[10986.20s -> 10986.92s]  Let's go, bro.
[10997.79s -> 10999.23s]  No, I'm trapped.
[10999.23s -> 11000.11s]  I'm trapped.
[11004.51s -> 11004.83s]  Okay.
[11004.83s -> 11005.31s]  Fuck this.
[11005.31s -> 11006.27s]  I'm out of here.
[11006.27s -> 11007.71s]  I'm just going to bunny hop through the whole thing.
[11008.27s -> 11017.04s]  What's in here?
[11017.04s -> 11017.44s]  What's in here?
[11017.44s -> 11018.00s]  What's in here?
[11018.00s -> 11018.32s]  All right.
[11018.32s -> 11018.64s]  I got it.
[11018.64s -> 11018.80s]  I got it.
[11018.80s -> 11019.52s]  I got it.
[11019.52s -> 11040.54s]  He sucks.
[11040.54s -> 11041.10s]  I...
[11041.10s -> 11043.31s]  Another golden arm.
[11043.31s -> 11054.06s]  I keep hearing the horn.
[11054.06s -> 11060.54s]  I'm going to go up.
[11060.54s -> 11062.70s]  Stop fucking breathing in my ear.
[11062.70s -> 11063.90s]  It's like ASMR.
[11063.90s -> 11064.94s]  Leave me the fuck alone.
[11068.28s -> 11069.32s]  He takes a sip and then he goes...
[11083.52s -> 11085.36s]  Why would you jump off?
[11085.36s -> 11098.65s]  I don't like this level.
[11098.65s -> 11099.61s]  I really don't.
[11099.61s -> 11100.96s]  I don't like this level.
[11100.96s -> 11104.24s]  I'm trying to jump onto the stupid platforms over there.
[11106.88s -> 11108.32s]  Oh, my freaking god.
[11108.32s -> 11111.50s]  Why would I jump off?
[11111.50s -> 11112.62s]  I'm not jumping up.
[11112.62s -> 11113.98s]  I'm trying to get off the ladder.
[11113.98s -> 11115.18s]  I can't just walk forward.
[11115.18s -> 11117.42s]  I have to jump like that.
[11118.06s -> 11120.91s]  I'm holding on for dear life.
[11120.91s -> 11121.95s]  What do I do?
[11121.95s -> 11122.99s]  Do I let go of space?
[11122.99s -> 11123.87s]  Should I let go of space?
[11123.87s -> 11126.19s]  I think if I let go of space, I pull myself up, right?
[11147.82s -> 11149.50s]  Weird dinosaur raptor guard.
[11149.50s -> 11157.36s]  All right.
[11157.36s -> 11158.00s]  Pig noise.
[11170.97s -> 11171.21s]  Whoa.
[11187.26s -> 11187.90s]  Got him.
[11187.90s -> 11198.00s]  Did I find a door?
[11198.00s -> 11201.53s]  I got a door.
[11203.52s -> 11204.80s]  Oh, my head.
[11207.05s -> 11208.01s]  I can't open this.
[11214.00s -> 11214.72s]  Come on.
[11214.72s -> 11222.67s]  So what am I doing up here?
[11222.67s -> 11234.12s]  Clean your face here.
[11234.12s -> 11235.00s]  A little bit sweaty.
[11235.00s -> 11240.76s]  This way.
[11240.76s -> 11244.60s]  I only have two earbuds in so I can tell where this horn is.
[11244.60s -> 11249.34s]  The game is too dark.
[11255.20s -> 11255.68s]  It's dark.
[11255.68s -> 11255.84s]  I know.
[11255.84s -> 11257.04s]  I'm trying to make it brighter.
[11257.04s -> 11262.17s]  By the way, why is it doing this?
[11262.17s -> 11268.81s]  It is dark, isn't it?
[11268.81s -> 11270.09s]  I don't know why it's so dark.
[11270.09s -> 11289.95s]  Is that better?
[11289.95s -> 11290.43s]  That's better.
[11290.43s -> 11291.29s]  Yeah.
[11291.29s -> 11292.17s]  It's meant to be dark.
[11292.17s -> 11293.53s]  I know, but like, come on.
[11293.53s -> 11294.41s]  We're gamers.
[11294.41s -> 11294.81s]  We're streamers.
[11294.81s -> 11295.77s]  I want to be able to see.
[11295.77s -> 11297.72s]  All right.
[11297.72s -> 11302.40s]  Honest to god, I think I have to go back down.
[11302.40s -> 11303.04s]  Wait.
[11303.04s -> 11304.00s]  No, I don't.
[11304.00s -> 11307.71s]  Check this shit out.
[11307.71s -> 11312.04s]  We're going to Donkey Kong Country this shit right now.
[11312.04s -> 11315.50s]  There's a rope.
[11315.50s -> 11323.84s]  Where's the rope?
[11323.84s -> 11324.72s]  Rope arrow.
[11324.72s -> 11334.11s]  This doesn't work.
[11334.11s -> 11334.88s]  It only...
[11334.88s -> 11337.12s]  It doesn't...
[11337.12s -> 11339.12s]  I want to reload then because that sucks.
[11339.12s -> 11348.76s]  It only works on wood.
[11348.76s -> 11349.64s]  Oh, that's annoying.
[11351.77s -> 11355.20s]  That's annoying.
[11355.20s -> 11355.44s]  All right.
[11355.44s -> 11356.48s]  I got to go back down.
[11356.48s -> 11357.68s]  Get the arrows ready.
[11357.68s -> 11379.45s]  Go down the ladder.
[11379.45s -> 11397.77s]  What is all this?
[11397.77s -> 11399.13s]  Hold on.
[11399.13s -> 11400.33s]  Ladder right there, too.
[11400.33s -> 11403.24s]  Trinkets?
[11403.24s -> 11403.64s]  Nope.
[11403.64s -> 11405.68s]  Are we trinket up here?
[11405.68s -> 11411.69s]  What's the point of this?
[11411.69s -> 11412.67s]  It has to...
[11412.67s -> 11413.87s]  It can't just be for no reason.
[11413.87s -> 11415.07s]  It has to be a point to do this, right?
[11415.07s -> 11420.92s]  What's the point?
[11420.92s -> 11422.94s]  For realism?
[11422.94s -> 11424.22s]  To avoid enemies.
[11424.22s -> 11447.52s]  Hey!
[11447.52s -> 11450.57s]  Hey!
[11450.57s -> 11451.13s]  Hey!
[11451.13s -> 11452.65s]  Somebody's shooting arrows at me.
[11452.65s -> 11453.93s]  Who's shooting arrows?
[11453.93s -> 11458.25s]  I hear arrows firing at me.
[11458.25s -> 11459.69s]  I don't know from what direction.
[11459.69s -> 11467.26s]  Don't go down there.
[11467.26s -> 11481.10s]  Okay.
[11481.10s -> 11482.62s]  They're going around in a circle.
[11482.62s -> 11506.38s]  Wait.
[11506.38s -> 11507.18s]  What did I do that for?
[11507.18s -> 11509.76s]  This is a giant circle.
[11509.76s -> 11512.33s]  What do I do?
[11512.33s -> 11512.65s]  Wait.
[11512.65s -> 11513.29s]  Hold on.
[11513.29s -> 11516.73s]  Here we go.
[11516.73s -> 11524.68s]  Oh, this place is so confusing.
[11524.68s -> 11525.96s]  This place is so confusing.
[11525.96s -> 11528.99s]  Can I go over here?
[11528.99s -> 11582.03s]  The music's getting louder.
[11582.03s -> 11584.19s]  I was trying to just fucking run by him.
[11584.19s -> 11592.49s]  What's that say?
[11593.60s -> 11594.40s]  Quintus.
[11594.40s -> 11595.08s]  I made it.
[11595.08s -> 11595.64s]  I made it.
[11595.64s -> 11596.12s]  I got it.
[11596.12s -> 11596.68s]  I got it.
[11602.96s -> 11603.36s]  Safe.
[11603.36s -> 11606.09s]  Jerma, be quiet.
[11606.09s -> 11607.45s]  My mother's trying to sleep.
[11607.45s -> 11609.13s]  Turn my volume down.
[11609.13s -> 11610.19s]  Turn me down.
[11610.19s -> 11614.06s]  I was trying to...
[11614.06s -> 11614.54s]  Whatever.
[11614.54s -> 11617.52s]  Okay.
[11617.52s -> 11618.64s]  I can take this out now.
[11618.64s -> 11622.08s]  I was trying to match the guy's speech.
[11622.08s -> 11627.87s]  Climb the ladder.
[11627.87s -> 11628.67s]  You dumb.
[11628.67s -> 11638.11s]  Get the holy water ready.
[11638.11s -> 11648.01s]  Okay.
[11648.01s -> 11648.41s]  We're fine.
[11653.18s -> 11654.06s]  I knew it was going to happen.
[11654.06s -> 11655.90s]  It's so wonky to jump off the ladder.
[11655.90s -> 11661.05s]  Why is Beard Jerma so mean?
[11661.05s -> 11662.51s]  I'm not mean.
[11662.51s -> 11662.99s]  What are you talking about?
[11662.99s -> 11663.95s]  I'm just chilling around.
[11663.95s -> 11669.04s]  I'm right there.
[11669.04s -> 11669.60s]  Just do it.
[11669.60s -> 11677.96s]  Is there ever a game that's gotten ladders right?
[11695.42s -> 11696.30s]  Dark Souls.
[11696.30s -> 11698.25s]  Dark Souls ladders were fine.
[11699.50s -> 11700.22s]  Because you didn't...
[11700.30s -> 11702.78s]  I have to kind of first person stick on them.
[11702.78s -> 11706.33s]  You actually climbed them.
[11706.33s -> 11709.85s]  So your character was just on it, you know?
[11709.85s -> 11714.25s]  But in FPS where you have to attach to a ladder and get off of a ladder.
[11714.25s -> 11714.73s]  I don't...
[11714.73s -> 11716.89s]  I don't think it's possible to make that good.
[11716.89s -> 11717.45s]  I don't.
[11717.45s -> 11724.25s]  It's such an awkward movement.
[11724.25s -> 11724.97s]  Just by...
[11725.61s -> 11728.76s]  You think you can snipe me from down there?
[11728.76s -> 11759.12s]  There it is.
[11759.12s -> 11759.76s]  Go up.
[11760.40s -> 11766.76s]  Thank you.
[11766.76s -> 11767.48s]  Now what?
[11767.48s -> 11776.24s]  Did I win?
[11776.24s -> 11777.44s]  Find the horn of Quintus.
[11777.44s -> 11787.13s]  Got it.
[11787.13s -> 11791.05s]  The ancient corruption was again contained.
[11791.05s -> 11792.97s]  To do more would have upset the balance.
[11792.97s -> 11796.49s]  But we knew to remain ever vigilant lest it resurface.
[11799.66s -> 11803.82s]  Neither the hammers nor the pagans could be trusted not to meddle.
[11806.49s -> 11807.61s]  Keeper annals.
[11808.41s -> 11811.53s]  I had some money to spare after disposing of the horn.
[11811.53s -> 11814.49s]  So it seemed time to invest in some new tools.
[11815.37s -> 11815.85s]  Farkas.
[11815.85s -> 11816.41s]  Functionals.
[11816.41s -> 11819.77s]  Farkas is one of the few merchants willing to risk selling to an independent like me.
[11819.77s -> 11821.45s]  And his prices are steep.
[11821.45s -> 11825.77s]  But the other choice is to let one of the so-called wardens give me orders.
[11825.77s -> 11827.37s]  And take a cut of my profits.
[11828.33s -> 11832.17s]  They've been after me for years to join one of their stables but I'm not interested.
[11832.81s -> 11834.65s]  Maybe they'll get the idea and give up.
[11835.29s -> 11837.69s]  More likely they'll just ramp up the threats.
[11838.97s -> 11840.97s]  Nothing I can't handle if I'm careful.
[11842.01s -> 11843.13s]  And lucky.
[11843.13s -> 11846.01s]  And my luck seems to have finally turned for the better.
[11846.01s -> 11846.73s]  Where we going now?
[11847.77s -> 11854.20s]  Now that you've got the finest in lockpicks you can go after more challenging and lucrative targets.
[11854.84s -> 11856.36s]  How about the local hammer temple?
[11856.36s -> 11858.20s]  Get at least a thousand loot.
[11858.92s -> 11860.17s]  Ahem.
[11860.17s -> 11860.67s]  Okay.
[11861.05s -> 11863.00s]  So I got lockpicks.
[11863.72s -> 11865.45s]  Gotta steal a bunch of loot.
[11865.45s -> 11866.17s]  I got a lot of money.
[11868.60s -> 11870.36s]  The fire arrows are explosions.
[11870.36s -> 11874.97s]  They're so loud and annoying.
[11874.97s -> 11876.41s]  I want at least a couple health potions.
[11877.05s -> 11880.03s]  Can I take more moss?
[11880.67s -> 11883.92s]  I don't use them though.
[11884.48s -> 11886.12s]  Playing on normal.
[11886.12s -> 11887.80s]  Yeah I'm a normal gamer.
[11888.36s -> 11893.50s]  The water arrows maybe I'll take a couple.
[11893.50s -> 11894.62s]  They're expensive though.
[11899.29s -> 11903.45s]  Fine I'll take one fire arrow and then a moss arrow.
[11904.17s -> 11905.05s]  And then just more of these.
[11905.61s -> 11905.93s]  Sure.
[11905.93s -> 11906.73s]  Alright sounds good.
[11907.45s -> 11909.39s]  Okay here we go.
[11909.39s -> 11910.11s]  Let me save it.
[11911.40s -> 11913.96s]  You get uh I'll get back here for you guys.
[11914.60s -> 11915.80s]  Save the game.
[11915.80s -> 11917.00s]  A hard save slot.
[11918.03s -> 11918.43s]  Okay.
[11918.99s -> 11919.55s]  How are we?
[11927.77s -> 11928.01s]  What?
[11931.71s -> 11935.76s]  Oh my god free stuff.
[11936.81s -> 11938.09s]  Why did I buy anything?
[11938.09s -> 11939.05s]  Why did I buy anything?
[11939.61s -> 11940.65s]  I have a this is all free.
[11941.37s -> 11948.75s]  Oh my goodness.
[11948.75s -> 11950.99s]  Holy that's a lot of stuff.
[11950.99s -> 11955.18s]  Okay what about this?
[11955.18s -> 11957.58s]  Anything else in here?
[11957.58s -> 11968.20s]  Alright so now I gotta I gotta trail the thugs who just tried to assassinate you
[11968.20s -> 11969.48s]  without being detected.
[11972.25s -> 11972.81s]  Where'd they go?
[11973.45s -> 11977.04s]  I don't know where the hell they are.
[11987.36s -> 11988.48s]  I don't know where are they?
[11989.20s -> 11995.72s]  In here?
[11996.28s -> 12005.93s]  I don't know.
[12005.93s -> 12007.37s]  I was busy stealing everything.
[12007.37s -> 12008.65s]  Oh well I'll find them.
[12009.29s -> 12013.74s]  They down here?
[12014.46s -> 12017.23s]  Oh they came down here.
[12017.79s -> 12021.47s]  What happened to me?
[12021.47s -> 12023.92s]  Did I just like I die?
[12024.64s -> 12030.22s]  Oh I thought I got like fucking like close to a giant trap and it instantly killed me.
[12030.78s -> 12032.46s]  I thought like I got sniped or something.
[12032.46s -> 12037.47s]  Alright um so I need to open up that hard save then.
[12047.45s -> 12048.25s]  Hey!
[12048.25s -> 12066.70s]  Oh what are you doing you idiot?
[12067.98s -> 12069.10s]  Alright I gotta go quick.
[12084.86s -> 12086.70s]  Is that Microsoft network noises?
[12092.54s -> 12093.66s]  Alright stay silent.
[12093.66s -> 12094.22s]  Stay quiet.
[12099.98s -> 12101.02s]  MSN sounds?
[12105.23s -> 12106.91s]  MSN chat.
[12106.91s -> 12109.53s]  That's so stupid.
[12119.02s -> 12120.22s]  I'm fine whatever.
[12121.76s -> 12125.77s]  No you I don't want to watch this guy die again.
[12125.77s -> 12126.49s]  Alright go go go.
[12131.24s -> 12131.80s]  You dumb.
[12131.80s -> 12133.40s]  I was reading chat.
[12133.40s -> 12133.90s]  Sorry.
[12144.67s -> 12145.17s]  Hail them.
[12147.36s -> 12148.48s]  Explosion arrows ready.
[12149.66s -> 12151.10s]  Explosion arrows at the ready.
[12151.10s -> 12169.31s]  Funny.
[12169.31s -> 12170.03s]  Funny joke.
[12170.59s -> 12172.81s]  He was doing the same.
[12189.71s -> 12191.07s]  No one is following you.
[12191.07s -> 12191.95s]  Relax.
[12191.95s -> 12200.65s]  Where'd they go?
[12200.65s -> 12201.45s]  Where'd they go?
[12201.45s -> 12201.85s]  Where'd they go?
[12201.85s -> 12202.33s]  Where'd they go?
[12202.33s -> 12202.81s]  Where'd they go?
[12202.81s -> 12203.53s]  Where'd they go?
[12203.53s -> 12204.09s]  Where'd they go?
[12204.09s -> 12204.49s]  Where'd they go?
[12204.49s -> 12204.97s]  Where'd they go?
[12206.06s -> 12206.54s]  Where'd they go?
[12207.42s -> 12208.38s]  I didn't see where they went.
[12209.02s -> 12237.74s]  Wait!
[12237.74s -> 12257.66s]  Moss arrows.
[12257.66s -> 12258.14s]  Shit!
[12258.14s -> 12259.02s]  Where'd they go?
[12259.02s -> 12295.18s]  Wait we're just going in a big circle.
[12295.18s -> 12315.20s]  It's gonna be loud.
[12315.20s -> 12315.84s]  Moss arrows.
[12355.90s -> 12359.02s]  Why do they keep stopping?
[12359.02s -> 12364.40s]  He's having an allergic reaction to the game?
[12364.40s -> 12367.18s]  What are you talking about?
[12367.18s -> 12374.19s]  Hey just spirit.
[12374.19s -> 12375.07s]  Where'd they go?
[12375.15s -> 12375.47s]  What?
[12375.47s -> 12376.11s]  Oh over here.
[12376.11s -> 12401.84s]  Ah you can't see me it's dark.
[12401.84s -> 12416.75s]  Idiot.
[12416.75s -> 12416.99s]  How?
[12416.99s -> 12417.31s]  This is...
[12418.43s -> 12420.49s]  This is long.
[12420.49s -> 12421.45s]  This is really...
[12446.06s -> 12447.42s]  His ass is too big.
[12460.14s -> 12460.64s]  Hey.
[12462.86s -> 12463.36s]  Hey.
[12463.98s -> 12468.97s]  Pick his body up.
[12468.97s -> 12470.17s]  What are you thinking?
[12470.17s -> 12471.53s]  Pick his body up and throw him over here.
[12472.25s -> 12494.46s]  All right I'm in.
[12494.46s -> 12497.08s]  Hey.
[12497.08s -> 12497.56s]  These soft?
[12497.56s -> 12512.22s]  These are soft sounds right?
[12512.22s -> 12517.50s]  Let's pitch black right here.
[12517.50s -> 12517.90s]  What do I have?
[12517.90s -> 12518.78s]  What's my mission?
[12518.78s -> 12524.17s]  Time to show Ramirez who the real criminal mastermind is.
[12524.17s -> 12526.41s]  Break into his mansion and take what he values most.
[12526.41s -> 12528.12s]  His wealth.
[12528.12s -> 12530.76s]  Purse from his belt should make the point.
[12531.85s -> 12532.57s]  Loot the mansion.
[12532.57s -> 12533.21s]  All right.
[12533.21s -> 12534.41s]  I just need to get a lot of money.
[12538.94s -> 12539.74s]  Not going that way.
[12556.86s -> 12557.34s]  Give me that key.
[12557.90s -> 12560.01s]  This guy's got a key.
[12560.65s -> 12565.00s]  Somebody get coming?
[12565.00s -> 12568.11s]  Oh shit.
[12570.03s -> 12570.83s]  Oh shit.
[12570.83s -> 12571.31s]  Don't go.
[12571.31s -> 12571.79s]  Just wait.
[12571.79s -> 12578.75s]  It's fine.
[12578.75s -> 12579.71s]  It's not for this door.
[12587.13s -> 12593.47s]  I thought I was gonna throw it further.
[12608.38s -> 12609.58s]  I have lockpicks?
[12609.58s -> 12617.05s]  This doesn't work on this door.
[12617.05s -> 12627.10s]  I have to get through here.
[12628.54s -> 12630.43s]  I have to get through here.
[12630.43s -> 12631.71s]  Try another shape.
[12631.71s -> 12647.74s]  I want to be able to hide in here.
[12647.74s -> 12651.21s]  Really?
[12651.21s -> 12652.33s]  Ooh.
[12652.33s -> 12657.63s]  Let's do the paintings.
[12657.63s -> 12663.63s]  Is that the Dana DeVito guy from Hercules?
[12663.63s -> 12668.49s]  Who is that?
[12668.49s -> 12668.81s]  Come on.
[12668.81s -> 12669.69s]  Something secret back here.
[12675.85s -> 12676.33s]  Oh wait.
[12676.33s -> 12677.29s]  I do have other shapes.
[12677.29s -> 12677.61s]  You're right.
[12677.61s -> 12677.85s]  All right.
[12677.85s -> 12678.33s]  That's all right.
[12704.41s -> 12704.73s]  Stop.
[12713.60s -> 12714.00s]  Stop.
[12714.00s -> 12715.44s]  I know you can't see shit.
[12715.44s -> 12716.24s]  Leave me alone.
[12716.24s -> 12719.84s]  Can I take out the?
[12719.84s -> 12720.08s]  All right.
[12720.08s -> 12720.96s]  I'm throwing a flashbang.
[12720.96s -> 12735.42s]  Is someone there?
[12735.42s -> 12736.30s]  Everybody close your eyes.
[12736.30s -> 12736.78s]  Close your eyes.
[12736.78s -> 12737.26s]  Close your eyes.
[12737.26s -> 12737.74s]  Close your eyes.
[12737.74s -> 12738.46s]  Close your eyes.
[12738.46s -> 12755.48s]  I'm just not going over here.
[12755.48s -> 12756.12s]  I'm going the other way.
[12756.84s -> 12758.04s]  Stop seeing me.
[12758.04s -> 12764.19s]  I'm going a different way.
[12764.19s -> 12775.96s]  Those flashbangs are so bright.
[12775.96s -> 12776.68s]  A fair warning.
[12776.68s -> 12777.72s]  If I use those flashbangs,
[12777.72s -> 12778.44s]  they're going to be horrible.
[12778.44s -> 12780.12s]  So just be prepared for them.
[12780.12s -> 12782.99s]  I'll try to give you warning.
[12782.99s -> 12783.79s]  I'll say close your eyes.
[12783.79s -> 12784.27s]  Close your eyes.
[12784.27s -> 12785.07s]  Close your eyes.
[12785.07s -> 12795.20s]  Close your eyes.
[12795.20s -> 12796.40s]  Everybody close your eyes.
[12796.40s -> 12804.59s]  Open your eyes.
[12804.59s -> 12805.63s]  I'm not going to use it.
[12805.63s -> 12807.55s]  Will they see this or hear this?
[12839.95s -> 12842.35s]  Disguards it everywhere in this mission.
[12842.35s -> 12843.39s]  Oh my goodness.
[12843.39s -> 12844.35s]  How am I going to do this?
[12846.81s -> 12847.93s]  Lowercase scream.
[12849.29s -> 12849.93s]  Like...
[12856.84s -> 12858.28s]  Oh my god.
[12859.40s -> 12860.52s]  Hey, hi everybody.
[12860.52s -> 12861.48s]  Hi, I'm a thief.
[12861.48s -> 12862.76s]  Nobody can stop me.
[12862.76s -> 12863.72s]  What are you going to do about it?
[12864.44s -> 12865.72s]  Everybody close your eyes.
[12865.72s -> 12866.28s]  Close your eyes.
[12866.28s -> 12866.68s]  Close your eyes.
[12866.68s -> 12867.08s]  Close your eyes.
[12867.08s -> 12867.56s]  Close your eyes.
[12867.56s -> 12868.60s]  One, two, three.
[12869.40s -> 12878.40s]  They all went the wrong way.
[12878.40s -> 12878.72s]  I'm good.
[12897.82s -> 12899.10s]  Open the fucking door.
[12899.82s -> 12901.29s]  All right, I'm done.
[12901.29s -> 12904.91s]  I'm not.
[12904.91s -> 12906.11s]  This is the guard quarters.
[12906.11s -> 12907.15s]  Don't open that door.
[12911.40s -> 12912.28s]  Door stuck.
[12912.84s -> 12917.61s]  How much do I have so far?
[12917.61s -> 12918.33s]  How much have I stolen?
[12920.68s -> 12921.08s]  None.
[12921.24s -> 12928.48s]  There's got to be some expensive shit up here, right?
[12928.48s -> 12929.12s]  Give me a break.
[12929.12s -> 12943.48s]  Look at how expensive this carpet is.
[12943.48s -> 12946.08s]  Here we go.
[12946.08s -> 12946.88s]  What's in here?
[12946.88s -> 12947.68s]  Something.
[12947.68s -> 12948.80s]  Valuables.
[12948.80s -> 12951.07s]  Bingo.
[12951.07s -> 12953.39s]  Lord Ramirez, the reinforced walls and steel door
[12953.39s -> 12955.79s]  have been day-dutely installed
[12955.79s -> 12957.39s]  about your accounting room.
[12957.39s -> 12958.99s]  But I must warn you that we cannot guarantee
[12958.99s -> 12960.75s]  that against brick tunneling.
[12961.63s -> 12963.23s]  If you do not move the creatures
[12963.23s -> 12965.15s]  out of the basement into a more distant area,
[12965.15s -> 12966.19s]  we cannot be held responsible
[12966.19s -> 12967.87s]  for the potential damages.
[12967.87s -> 12980.67s]  All right, there's valuables over here.
[12981.31s -> 12982.81s]  Anything in there?
[12982.81s -> 12983.37s]  I don't know.
[12983.37s -> 12984.49s]  How much do I have so far?
[12984.49s -> 12985.29s]  I need a thousand.
[12985.85s -> 12987.13s]  All right, I got a hundred bucks right now.
[12987.13s -> 12988.81s]  I need like nine more items.
[12988.81s -> 12991.15s]  What does it look for?
[12991.15s -> 12992.67s]  Hidden panels on the walls.
[12992.67s -> 12998.68s]  I don't see anything in here.
[12998.68s -> 13000.36s]  All right, not a bad start.
[13000.36s -> 13001.08s]  Let's go.
[13001.08s -> 13013.88s]  He's walking.
[13013.88s -> 13023.44s]  Ooh, a rare painting.
[13023.44s -> 13024.96s]  No, that's a chair.
[13024.96s -> 13027.32s]  I thought it was a painting.
[13027.32s -> 13028.12s]  Hold on.
[13028.12s -> 13030.88s]  Why do you have nothing?
[13031.44s -> 13032.91s]  You have, why do you have nothing?
[13036.28s -> 13037.08s]  Really?
[13037.08s -> 13044.78s]  Keep going.
[13044.78s -> 13046.72s]  Where am I?
[13046.72s -> 13047.92s]  I'm on the second floor.
[13047.92s -> 13054.38s]  I could go down to the basement
[13054.38s -> 13056.54s]  and go kind of into his private counting chambers.
[13057.10s -> 13061.66s]  Okay, this topic, wait.
[13061.66s -> 13062.86s]  Let me check that other room.
[13062.86s -> 13068.73s]  Why does your mic have an echo?
[13068.73s -> 13071.90s]  It shouldn't have an echo.
[13072.54s -> 13077.92s]  All right, I open this door.
[13078.56s -> 13085.61s]  The key, lockpick.
[13085.61s -> 13087.71s]  Ooh, is that working?
[13096.94s -> 13098.30s]  I don't know what's happening here.
[13098.30s -> 13101.34s]  Got it, I guess.
[13105.87s -> 13118.20s]  Hold it.
[13118.20s -> 13119.80s]  All right, private stash.
[13119.80s -> 13139.53s]  What do we got?
[13139.53s -> 13139.93s]  What?
[13139.93s -> 13152.65s]  There's nothing even in here.
[13152.65s -> 13157.37s]  Don't press that button.
[13160.89s -> 13166.11s]  That's the Diet Coke button.
[13166.11s -> 13168.06s]  Ooh, expensive.
[13168.06s -> 13169.26s]  Very expensive stuff.
[13169.26s -> 13171.84s]  What was that?
[13171.84s -> 13173.90s]  200.
[13173.90s -> 13178.59s]  Well, I don't need that now.
[13178.59s -> 13182.49s]  Richard Dayanian.
[13182.49s -> 13183.85s]  I know with displeasure that, again,
[13183.85s -> 13187.23s]  one of my tough boys has been taken to Craig's Cleft.
[13187.23s -> 13190.27s]  May I remind you of the substantial donations I make to your office,
[13190.27s -> 13195.96s]  such that I may pursue business unhindered by idle scrutiny.
[13195.96s -> 13200.17s]  May I remind you as well of your predecessor's unfortunate end.
[13200.17s -> 13202.49s]  The rivers are so treacherous this time of year.
[13202.49s -> 13205.40s]  I trust that you will attend to this.
[13205.40s -> 13207.64s]  And if the hammers are too difficult for your policemen,
[13207.64s -> 13209.32s]  I trust as well that you'll let me know.
[13209.32s -> 13219.20s]  Here's something.
[13219.20s -> 13225.60s]  Private's book stash or something.
[13225.60s -> 13226.24s]  What is this?
[13226.24s -> 13229.07s]  What is this place?
[13229.07s -> 13240.38s]  This is weird.
[13240.38s -> 13241.66s]  That looks expensive.
[13241.66s -> 13242.76s]  Oh, my goodness.
[13242.76s -> 13243.56s]  Very expensive.
[13247.79s -> 13248.11s]  Nice.
[13248.67s -> 13249.55s]  Can I get in there?
[13250.11s -> 13257.04s]  How much more do I need?
[13260.16s -> 13261.18s]  Yeah.
[13261.18s -> 13261.98s]  Oh, I'm going to pick up.
[13263.55s -> 13264.11s]  Yeah.
[13264.11s -> 13267.92s]  All right.
[13267.92s -> 13268.80s]  I'm collecting money.
[13268.80s -> 13269.92s]  I'm doing all right.
[13269.92s -> 13272.01s]  Where?
[13272.01s -> 13275.42s]  Who?
[13275.42s -> 13276.38s]  Who's running?
[13276.38s -> 13277.02s]  I hear somebody.
[13277.58s -> 13291.05s]  Somebody up there next to the gigantic explosive barrel.
[13294.67s -> 13296.27s]  I can jump in that window.
[13296.27s -> 13300.94s]  I wonder if I should try it.
[13300.94s -> 13327.10s]  Not worth doing.
[13327.10s -> 13346.24s]  I can get it.
[13346.24s -> 13346.64s]  Nice.
[13346.64s -> 13347.68s]  OK, so what do I do with this?
[13347.68s -> 13352.49s]  What's the point of all this?
[13352.49s -> 13353.45s]  What did I just do that for?
[13361.31s -> 13372.14s]  What was this for?
[13372.14s -> 13373.34s]  Lock pick my way out of here?
[13389.98s -> 13390.54s]  Where is this guy?
[13394.54s -> 13398.08s]  The grass is not this loud.
[13398.08s -> 13398.64s]  Secret ladder.
[13398.64s -> 13399.20s]  Secret ladder.
[13399.20s -> 13400.40s]  Secret ladder in that fireplace.
[13400.40s -> 13401.52s]  Secret ladder in the fireplace.
[13401.52s -> 13403.66s]  The fireplace had a secret ladder.
[13403.66s -> 13407.80s]  Secret ladder?
[13407.80s -> 13412.64s]  Are you serious?
[13412.64s -> 13413.84s]  Go back and extinguish the fireplace.
[13413.84s -> 13414.88s]  There's a secret ladder in there.
[13414.88s -> 13432.57s]  There's a guy right here.
[13432.57s -> 13433.77s]  Oh, my goodness.
[13433.77s -> 13434.81s]  How did you wait for me?
[13434.81s -> 13436.25s]  You knew I was coming somehow.
[13438.78s -> 13439.98s]  Wow, that was terrifying.
[13448.24s -> 13448.56s]  All right.
[13448.56s -> 13449.60s]  Well, I got to be careful.
[13449.60s -> 13459.71s]  I'm just going to wait till they leave the room.
[13459.71s -> 13460.59s]  He's right here.
[13460.59s -> 13464.78s]  Peek your head out here.
[13464.78s -> 13466.38s]  I'm going to bludgeon you in the face.
[13472.86s -> 13486.09s]  The roof is really loud.
[13486.09s -> 13502.60s]  Moss.
[13502.60s -> 13508.73s]  I'm over the ledge.
[13508.73s -> 13509.45s]  I have an idea.
[13509.45s -> 13513.53s]  Close your eyes.
[13513.53s -> 13515.90s]  One, two, three.
[13515.90s -> 13529.37s]  I didn't want to fucking do that again.
[13529.37s -> 13534.27s]  How am I going to do this?
[13534.27s -> 13555.92s]  I got to get into the darkness here.
[13555.92s -> 13556.48s]  No.
[13556.48s -> 13572.22s]  I think I have to just wait till they get bored.
[13572.22s -> 13573.50s]  Use the bomb arrow?
[13573.50s -> 13587.04s]  I accidentally let go.
[13587.04s -> 13594.84s]  I slipped off.
[13594.84s -> 13596.60s]  There's no arrow.
[13596.60s -> 13598.51s]  I figured out why I miss.
[13598.51s -> 13601.39s]  There's no drop on these arrows.
[13601.39s -> 13603.39s]  They go in a straight line.
[13603.39s -> 13613.82s]  There's no drop.
[13613.82s -> 13614.14s]  All right.
[13614.14s -> 13614.70s]  One on one.
[13614.70s -> 13615.34s]  Let's go, buddy.
[13615.90s -> 13639.16s]  Oh, douche.
[13639.16s -> 13639.64s]  Touche.
[13639.64s -> 13640.44s]  Touche.
[13640.44s -> 13648.32s]  I don't think this guy knows how to swing a sword.
[13648.32s -> 13650.00s]  That guy has never trained how to swing a sword.
[13650.00s -> 13663.82s]  Everybody have anything on them?
[13663.82s -> 13667.72s]  That was just a prop for that guy.
[13667.72s -> 13670.57s]  They don't have anything on them.
[13670.57s -> 13671.21s]  All right.
[13671.21s -> 13673.68s]  How could I miss that?
[13673.68s -> 13675.04s]  We're good to go.
[13675.04s -> 13677.04s]  I have no more fire arrows though.
[13677.04s -> 13679.58s]  Oh, dude.
[13679.58s -> 13680.94s]  You guys weren't kidding around.
[13680.94s -> 13682.46s]  This is a secret entrance here.
[13682.46s -> 13686.65s]  But now that's important.
[13688.60s -> 13690.76s]  Now this is important stuff here now.
[13690.76s -> 13698.14s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[13698.14s -> 13701.55s]  Somebody else's bedroom or something.
[13701.55s -> 13702.97s]  What's this?
[13707.47s -> 13708.67s]  Can I climb through here?
[13708.67s -> 13718.09s]  Can't get through this.
[13718.65s -> 13721.82s]  I can't go through it.
[13721.82s -> 13726.64s]  I'm trying to stuff in.
[13726.64s -> 13727.44s]  I can't.
[13727.44s -> 13732.36s]  I can't.
[13732.36s -> 13737.21s]  How much money do I have now?
[13738.38s -> 13740.44s]  675.
[13740.44s -> 13741.16s]  No.
[13741.16s -> 13742.04s]  Total of 380.
[13742.04s -> 13742.68s]  I got 1,100.
[13742.68s -> 13743.08s]  I got it.
[13743.08s -> 13744.12s]  I have enough now.
[13744.12s -> 13747.05s]  Breaking his mansion.
[13747.05s -> 13748.25s]  Take what he values most.
[13748.25s -> 13749.77s]  The purse from his belt.
[13749.77s -> 13751.02s]  So I got to find his...
[13751.66s -> 13754.30s]  Where's his room?
[13755.10s -> 13755.66s]  I have enough.
[13756.22s -> 13756.94s]  Where's his room?
[13757.50s -> 13767.66s]  All right.
[13767.66s -> 13768.30s]  Nice.
[13768.30s -> 13771.45s]  I got enough money.
[13771.45s -> 13773.37s]  Now I got to find his personal belt?
[13773.93s -> 13778.16s]  Is this his room?
[13778.16s -> 13780.48s]  Second floor, basement, Ramirez mansion.
[13781.04s -> 13784.20s]  I feel like his room is still somewhere.
[13785.28s -> 13786.72s]  He's in the basement.
[13786.72s -> 13789.44s]  Do I have to go to the basement?
[13789.44s -> 13799.56s]  I'm on the first floor now.
[13799.96s -> 13801.98s]  Keep going.
[13801.98s -> 13809.05s]  Did he say there was a creature down here?
[13811.90s -> 13812.78s]  Like don't...
[13812.78s -> 13815.58s]  Watch out for that creature that you kept down there or something, right?
[13815.58s -> 13822.44s]  I don't see a creature.
[13822.44s -> 13834.83s]  Still in the basement.
[13834.83s -> 13835.47s]  This is a pretty...
[13836.11s -> 13840.19s]  I got a key though.
[13840.19s -> 13842.12s]  Hell yeah.
[13848.08s -> 13848.72s]  There's an alarm.
[13849.44s -> 13859.64s]  Oh, is that him?
[13859.64s -> 13859.88s]  That's him.
[13859.88s -> 13860.20s]  That's him.
[13860.20s -> 13860.44s]  That's him.
[13860.44s -> 13860.68s]  That's him.
[13860.68s -> 13861.08s]  That's him.
[13861.08s -> 13861.48s]  That's him.
[13861.48s -> 13861.96s]  I think that's him.
[13862.60s -> 13863.08s]  That's him.
[13863.64s -> 13865.77s]  Is that him?
[13880.14s -> 13891.66s]  The king sends his regards.
[13903.87s -> 13904.35s]  No!
[13904.35s -> 13905.55s]  I wanted to get the...
[13905.55s -> 13930.06s]  Yeah, there's like a bunch of shit in here.
[13930.06s -> 13931.90s]  I want to get the money first.
[13931.90s -> 13945.26s]  I'll just end the mission.
[13945.26s -> 13947.55s]  No.
[13947.55s -> 13948.11s]  Really?
[13948.11s -> 13949.36s]  How do I get in here?
[13949.36s -> 13952.40s]  Does he have a key?
[13952.40s -> 13958.33s]  I can't open these.
[13958.33s -> 13965.28s]  Here we go.
[13965.28s -> 13966.00s]  Hell yeah.
[13966.00s -> 13966.64s]  What's in here?
[13966.64s -> 13968.00s]  The other one works for this too, doesn't it?
[13968.00s -> 13970.38s]  Thank you very much.
[13970.38s -> 13971.96s]  What do you got?
[13971.96s -> 13984.60s]  Open it up.
[13984.60s -> 13985.40s]  Open it!
[13985.40s -> 13987.37s]  Nice.
[13987.37s -> 13987.53s]  All right.
[13987.53s -> 13988.73s]  I just want to get all the items.
[13988.73s -> 13991.58s]  All right.
[13991.58s -> 13991.98s]  Here we go.
[13991.98s -> 13992.54s]  Hell yeah.
[13992.54s -> 14003.63s]  That coke button?
[14003.63s -> 14004.11s]  Eh.
[14004.11s -> 14006.89s]  All right.
[14006.89s -> 14007.69s]  Cutscene coming up.
[14007.69s -> 14015.26s]  That was a cool mission.
[14015.26s -> 14016.76s]  I like that one.
[14016.76s -> 14024.57s]  Stealing fur and fang of beasts for survival.
[14024.57s -> 14030.48s]  Then came the builder who brought us the hammer.
[14030.48s -> 14032.96s]  And with it we forged a new way of life.
[14037.40s -> 14040.60s]  Reject the hammer is to denounce the builder.
[14040.60s -> 14041.72s]  Book of hammers.
[14041.72s -> 14046.28s]  I was going to pay a base collection a visit,
[14046.28s -> 14059.37s]  but the thing is that they haven't divvied the boot-eaters' base.
[14060.40s -> 14061.52s]  Sounds like they could use it.
[14061.52s -> 14062.48s]  What do you mean the creature?
[14063.28s -> 14065.12s]  There's a creature down there or something that I can like...
[14066.08s -> 14066.72s]  What do you want me to do?
[14066.72s -> 14068.99s]  Steal the base from them.
[14068.99s -> 14072.75s]  They'll be so busy blaming each other no one will suspect an outsider.
[14074.75s -> 14076.59s]  You can milk the creature.
[14076.59s -> 14077.47s]  It's a meme.
[14077.47s -> 14077.79s]  Okay.
[14077.79s -> 14078.43s]  Well, I don't...
[14079.47s -> 14080.67s]  I don't really care.
[14080.67s -> 14082.91s]  The guild's hideout is beneath the casino.
[14083.55s -> 14087.63s]  I have a rough map of the complex I got from sources from the inside.
[14088.51s -> 14090.27s]  Once I'm in the overlord's fancy,
[14090.27s -> 14092.91s]  I'll have to search for the secret entrance to the hideout.
[14093.47s -> 14094.59s]  I have to be careful.
[14095.31s -> 14097.31s]  The downwinders know me all too well.
[14098.27s -> 14099.79s]  If they catch sight of me, they'll know I took the base.
[14099.79s -> 14102.27s]  Nobody said you should really skip this mission.
[14102.27s -> 14104.59s]  They don't just kill me for trespassing.
[14104.59s -> 14105.31s]  Does this one suck?
[14106.83s -> 14110.83s]  Finding the base may prove difficult since I have no idea where it is.
[14111.87s -> 14114.59s]  It should be a hot topic of conversation among the down...
[14114.59s -> 14116.03s]  Skip this mission, it sucks.
[14117.07s -> 14117.95s]  Yes, this one sucks.
[14119.15s -> 14122.20s]  This is the worst mission in the game.
[14122.20s -> 14122.84s]  Skip this one.
[14125.31s -> 14126.51s]  I don't think I can skip missions.
[14127.15s -> 14132.35s]  This one has an incredibly confusing layout.
[14134.20s -> 14137.00s]  I mean, is it possible that I could bunny hop all the way to the end and pick up the item?
[14138.17s -> 14139.85s]  I skipped this one in my playthrough too.
[14139.85s -> 14140.41s]  Really?
[14140.41s -> 14141.05s]  Why is it so bad?
[14141.69s -> 14146.88s]  All right, break into the downwind thieves guild by breaking into the gambling den.
[14147.60s -> 14149.13s]  The overlord's fancy.
[14149.69s -> 14151.72s]  Thrive the sapphire vase.
[14152.36s -> 14155.29s]  Guild mates stealing the vase more difficult.
[14155.29s -> 14155.93s]  Make them pay.
[14155.93s -> 14157.77s]  Don't leave with less than a thousand in loot.
[14158.33s -> 14160.51s]  Get out of the guild and bat...
[14160.51s -> 14162.19s]  All right, so just take a thousand bucks.
[14162.19s -> 14163.23s]  Get the vase and get out.
[14163.95s -> 14165.39s]  Is he enough?
[14171.28s -> 14174.72s]  Uh, yeah, I'm taking like at least two of these.
[14174.72s -> 14180.99s]  Maybe not that many.
[14180.99s -> 14185.10s]  See you in four hours.
[14187.24s -> 14187.96s]  I can't even...
[14187.96s -> 14189.32s]  I don't think I can skip.
[14189.32s -> 14192.57s]  I'll figure it out.
[14192.57s -> 14193.45s]  Whatever.
[14193.45s -> 14197.40s]  I like the water arrows though.
[14197.40s -> 14198.12s]  They're very useful.
[14198.68s -> 14200.96s]  All right, that sounds good to me.
[14201.92s -> 14210.96s]  Okay, so yeah, that is a...
[14211.76s -> 14218.83s]  I feel like I have to go like this and lean in real close and get to about here.
[14219.63s -> 14223.82s]  And then the girl from the exorcist is going to scream in my face.
[14223.82s -> 14224.54s]  What is this map?
[14230.68s -> 14233.50s]  Okay.
[14233.50s -> 14234.30s]  Howdy.
[14234.30s -> 14241.79s]  What did I do wrong?
[14241.79s -> 14247.68s]  This guy's going to step on it.
[14247.68s -> 14250.40s]  I'm going to make you bleed.
[14250.40s -> 14251.60s]  Somebody step on it.
[14254.54s -> 14258.60s]  So what?
[14258.60s -> 14259.88s]  They don't like that I'm...
[14259.88s -> 14260.68s]  What do they don't...
[14260.68s -> 14261.16s]  All right, let me just...
[14261.88s -> 14265.18s]  Okay, they don't like me at all.
[14265.18s -> 14266.22s]  They don't want to see me at all.
[14269.58s -> 14270.30s]  Open the door.
[14285.12s -> 14285.52s]  Fuck you.
[14286.32s -> 14291.29s]  Okay.
[14291.29s -> 14295.29s]  So nobody can see me, which is weird because how am I supposed to walk by this?
[14295.29s -> 14299.40s]  Oh, what?
[14299.40s -> 14300.92s]  I can't even exist?
[14300.92s -> 14304.06s]  What are you talking about?
[14304.06s -> 14308.52s]  What am I doing?
[14309.16s -> 14311.31s]  I'm like passing out.
[14311.31s -> 14311.79s]  What's happening?
[14323.34s -> 14324.14s]  I think I have to sit here.
[14325.82s -> 14328.06s]  No, now he hasn't given me the password.
[14328.06s -> 14329.02s]  Are you tapping me?
[14330.22s -> 14331.26s]  He's tapping me?
[14333.26s -> 14336.54s]  And I'm standing here listening to Dano tell you the password.
[14336.54s -> 14339.10s]  Do you think he's going to let me if I'm not in the guild?
[14339.10s -> 14341.74s]  Or you think I'm lackwood enough not to remember it?
[14341.74s -> 14342.54s]  Shudder.
[14342.54s -> 14343.82s]  I'll put up with your airs.
[14343.82s -> 14345.92s]  I got you now, Tapper.
[14345.92s -> 14346.72s]  Shudder.
[14346.72s -> 14347.76s]  I'll put up with your airs.
[14347.76s -> 14348.40s]  Over here!
[14348.40s -> 14351.60s]  But if you start putting it like I'm not much of a fool, there will...
[14354.89s -> 14357.29s]  That guy still had to get his point across.
[14369.50s -> 14370.78s]  Excuse me?
[14371.50s -> 14372.78s]  He didn't see me at all.
[14386.20s -> 14387.16s]  Let me in too!
[14389.80s -> 14390.76s]  Big mistake.
[14391.48s -> 14393.96s]  You left the door wide open.
[14397.21s -> 14398.65s]  What are you doing in there?
[14398.65s -> 14399.61s]  You bastard!
[14399.61s -> 14404.01s]  Open up for me, please!
[14404.01s -> 14404.73s]  Knock, knock!
[14405.37s -> 14406.25s]  Anybody home?
[14411.18s -> 14412.14s]  See you right...
[14412.70s -> 14413.90s]  Late time.
[14413.90s -> 14426.11s]  What do I do now?
[14426.11s -> 14430.86s]  Let him talk.
[14430.86s -> 14440.38s]  I'm just every orc in every movie.
[14440.38s -> 14442.22s]  Let them do their little cutscene and I'll move on.
[14474.36s -> 14475.72s]  Not to remember it?
[14475.72s -> 14476.52s]  Shudder.
[14476.52s -> 14478.04s]  I'll put up with your airs a ways.
[14478.04s -> 14482.28s]  But if you start putting it like I'm not much of a fool, there will be blood.
[14482.28s -> 14483.40s]  Now open this door!
[14488.09s -> 14494.96s]  Pop the door, motherfucker!
[14495.60s -> 14519.36s]  Oh shit, there's a lady right there.
[14529.16s -> 14542.96s]  Ah!
[14542.96s -> 14543.68s]  I just...
[14543.68s -> 14544.48s]  I just might...
[14544.48s -> 14545.04s]  I just have...
[14545.04s -> 14547.85s]  It's a GTA after just roast up of people.
[14547.85s -> 14549.21s]  All right, relax, relax, relax.
[14552.12s -> 14553.24s]  Didn't I save after this?
[14553.80s -> 14555.63s]  I saved after this already, didn't I?
[14555.63s -> 14556.83s]  You want to argue with the lords?
[14556.83s -> 14558.32s]  What's the password?
[14558.32s -> 14559.15s]  Whatever.
[14559.15s -> 14560.99s]  All right, just close my eyes and just wait.
[14560.99s -> 14562.51s]  Open the door, okay?
[14562.51s -> 14564.99s]  Well, now he hasn't given me the password.
[14564.99s -> 14565.95s]  Are you tapping me?
[14566.91s -> 14570.25s]  Security is necessary to prevent...
[14570.25s -> 14573.53s]  And I'm standing here listening to Dan O'Tell you the password.
[14573.53s -> 14576.09s]  You think he's gonna let me if I'm not in the guild?
[14576.09s -> 14578.33s]  Or you think I'm liquid enough not to remember it?
[14578.33s -> 14581.53s]  This reminds me of a local like car commercial.
[14581.53s -> 14583.68s]  If you start putting it like I'm much of a fool, there will be blood.
[14583.68s -> 14585.28s]  This is Larry and Steve's.
[14586.16s -> 14588.48s]  Larry and Steve's auto empire.
[14588.48s -> 14590.80s]  Come on down and visit me and Steve.
[14590.80s -> 14592.08s]  We'll take good care of you.
[14592.72s -> 14593.44s]  Are we good?
[14594.00s -> 14595.79s]  Where did he come from?
[14598.72s -> 14599.84s]  All right, I'm going this way.
[14599.84s -> 14601.92s]  I'm not just gonna go in the front door.
[14601.92s -> 14604.00s]  I think I got away with it.
[14604.00s -> 14604.24s]  I did.
[14604.24s -> 14604.72s]  Okay, let's go.
[14605.36s -> 14609.00s]  So I gotta get into the casino.
[14609.00s -> 14612.57s]  As you stole that from...
[14612.57s -> 14613.85s]  You know, there's a Justin Roiland joke.
[14614.49s -> 14626.41s]  Relax.
[14626.41s -> 14632.40s]  Okay, so is this the casino?
[14636.64s -> 14637.60s]  Save it.
[14637.60s -> 14642.19s]  It's so bright out here too.
[14648.57s -> 14649.13s]  Turn around.
[14649.13s -> 14649.63s]  Aye.
[14650.17s -> 14654.14s]  Okay, well, this is great.
[14655.10s -> 14656.86s]  Slowly walks up this hallway.
[14656.86s -> 14658.38s]  That's really fantastic.
[14658.94s -> 14665.26s]  You don't come all the way over here, right?
[14665.82s -> 14667.55s]  What the...
[14668.11s -> 14674.60s]  Okay, I'm hidden right here.
[14675.24s -> 14676.92s]  I could probably just smoke him, right?
[14683.00s -> 14683.72s]  This is dark.
[14701.31s -> 14702.11s]  Will there be keys on you?
[14702.11s -> 14703.23s]  All right, let's just take this guy.
[14703.23s -> 14709.95s]  Money helping doesn't work when you have a person.
[14709.95s -> 14715.74s]  Kind of does.
[14715.74s -> 14716.54s]  Yeah, it does.
[14716.54s -> 14721.34s]  All right, get into the casino.
[14721.34s -> 14722.30s]  Save it right here.
[14722.30s -> 14725.69s]  What is this place?
[14725.69s -> 14727.29s]  It's Merlin's workshop.
[14727.29s -> 14728.17s]  I don't know what this is.
[14728.17s -> 14734.67s]  It's locked.
[14734.67s -> 14748.14s]  None of these open.
[14748.14s -> 14750.81s]  Deliveries to the back door only.
[14750.81s -> 14751.93s]  Oh, I'm delivery.
[14751.93s -> 14753.52s]  I got a delivery for you.
[14753.52s -> 14764.67s]  Delivery.
[14764.67s -> 14779.96s]  Deliveries to the back door.
[14779.96s -> 14791.68s]  Hey.
[14791.68s -> 14792.18s]  Oh.
[14796.11s -> 14797.31s]  Wait, patience.
[14797.31s -> 14802.81s]  You don't come all the way over here, right?
[14802.81s -> 14804.70s]  Hope not.
[14817.53s -> 14837.50s]  All right, I'm in.
[14837.50s -> 14845.36s]  Oh, shit.
[14845.36s -> 14859.02s]  Where's his feet?
[14859.02s -> 14865.85s]  Oh, he's coming back.
[14865.85s -> 14898.57s]  I didn't know that that opened up to right there.
[14908.89s -> 14911.77s]  Oh, give me a break.
[14911.77s -> 14912.57s]  You didn't hear anything.
[14912.57s -> 14914.81s]  How would you hear that?
[14914.81s -> 14918.91s]  All right, I swear.
[14918.91s -> 14920.43s]  I gotta kill this guy right now.
[14920.43s -> 14922.24s]  I gotta wrap around and kill this guy.
[14929.26s -> 14929.74s]  Fuck.
[14929.74s -> 14933.44s]  I didn't mean to quick save.
[14962.84s -> 14967.36s]  Ron saved.
[14968.12s -> 14969.48s]  Ron has been officially saved.
[14969.48s -> 14970.12s]  We're okay.
[14970.12s -> 14984.30s]  All right, I gotta be more careful.
[14984.30s -> 15002.59s]  The door out of the way before I have a meltdown.
[15002.59s -> 15005.31s]  All right, relax.
[15005.31s -> 15006.49s]  Slow down.
[15006.49s -> 15012.62s]  Keep your mouth shut.
[15012.62s -> 15013.10s]  Keep your mouth shut.
[15013.10s -> 15013.66s]  Keep your mouth shut.
[15013.66s -> 15014.38s]  Keep your mouth shut.
[15014.38s -> 15015.10s]  Keep your mouth shut.
[15015.10s -> 15015.74s]  I'm gonna let you live.
[15015.74s -> 15016.54s]  Keep your mouth shut.
[15016.54s -> 15017.66s]  Keep your mouth shut.
[15017.66s -> 15018.86s]  You're gonna keep your mouth shut?
[15018.86s -> 15033.55s]  Gave him a chance.
[15033.55s -> 15034.67s]  I gave him an opportunity.
[15035.23s -> 15043.71s]  This looks like Wolfenstein.
[15043.71s -> 15044.99s]  Like this, the other ground.
[15045.55s -> 15054.48s]  What's down here?
[15056.86s -> 15061.21s]  I'll do that later.
[15061.21s -> 15080.81s]  Did he have a key on him or anything?
[15080.81s -> 15086.43s]  Line it up.
[15086.43s -> 15102.64s]  He wasn't doing anything?
[15102.64s -> 15104.96s]  If he had gotten up, I'm in a lot of trouble.
[15104.96s -> 15111.87s]  That's one less person to walk around and find me.
[15111.87s -> 15123.32s]  You have bloodlust.
[15123.32s -> 15125.24s]  I don't have bloodlust.
[15125.24s -> 15127.32s]  I'm just trying to think things realistically.
[15127.32s -> 15129.63s]  I'm just playing a video game.
[15129.63s -> 15132.96s]  If that guy gets up, I'm in trouble.
[15132.96s -> 15134.88s]  And you know for a fact I'm gonna throw a box at somebody
[15134.88s -> 15138.16s]  and he's gonna go from this line like this to
[15138.16s -> 15138.88s]  Oh, what was that?
[15138.88s -> 15140.00s]  And run straight out the door.
[15140.00s -> 15150.04s]  Like I'm not gonna have that chance.
[15150.04s -> 15150.84s]  I'm gonna go in here.
[15150.84s -> 15157.00s]  I don't wanna get hurt though.
[15157.00s -> 15157.96s]  Can I crouch and...
[15158.84s -> 15160.12s]  I have to take that damage.
[15160.12s -> 15161.08s]  That sucks.
[15161.08s -> 15171.68s]  Why am I...
[15171.68s -> 15172.08s]  This is like...
[15173.68s -> 15176.16s]  What's that game?
[15178.51s -> 15180.35s]  Boardwalk Empire.
[15180.35s -> 15186.96s]  A game with the music and it's hard
[15186.96s -> 15189.04s]  and you run around through the hallways and it's top down.
[15189.04s -> 15190.32s]  Hotline Miami.
[15190.32s -> 15198.08s]  Secret door.
[15198.08s -> 15198.32s]  All right.
[15198.32s -> 15198.88s]  Where am I?
[15203.20s -> 15205.84s]  They're so busy gambling their money away.
[15205.84s -> 15208.01s]  Notice if I take a bit.
[15216.52s -> 15218.44s]  Oh, he got a big key on him.
[15218.44s -> 15225.44s]  There's nobody even down here.
[15225.44s -> 15226.48s]  Just take everything.
[15226.48s -> 15228.97s]  Shit.
[15228.97s -> 15229.69s]  There are people here.
[15261.80s -> 15262.52s]  Can I play Blackjack?
[15282.54s -> 15283.82s]  How am I supposed to get by this?
[15284.38s -> 15291.53s]  I guess I can go...
[15291.53s -> 15293.13s]  Wait, there might be more stuff over here.
[15293.13s -> 15293.53s]  There is.
[15293.53s -> 15294.09s]  Of course there is.
[15307.12s -> 15307.60s]  Yes.
[15308.88s -> 15309.28s]  Yes.
[15317.76s -> 15317.92s]  All right.
[15317.92s -> 15319.28s]  There's more tables over here.
[15319.28s -> 15331.23s]  Now over here.
[15331.23s -> 15333.55s]  I don't spin the roulette table.
[15333.55s -> 15346.83s]  I did not know that was gonna happen.
[15346.83s -> 15348.76s]  All right.
[15348.76s -> 15349.48s]  I gotta go this way.
[15349.48s -> 15350.92s]  No, actually let me go over here first.
[15378.09s -> 15384.24s]  Jeremy, you gotta...
[15384.24s -> 15384.64s]  I'm not...
[15384.64s -> 15385.76s]  There's nobody to milk.
[15386.88s -> 15387.28s]  Relax.
[15387.84s -> 15399.56s]  Piece of shit.
[15399.56s -> 15400.60s]  I swear to God.
[15400.60s -> 15402.04s]  This guy's walking around.
[15402.04s -> 15410.11s]  All right.
[15410.11s -> 15411.31s]  Take out the torches.
[15411.31s -> 15413.15s]  Thanks for the reminder, video game.
[15416.44s -> 15419.32s]  Much better.
[15419.32s -> 15420.36s]  You don't even see anything.
[15420.36s -> 15421.00s]  Shut up.
[15421.00s -> 15461.95s]  All right.
[15461.95s -> 15463.23s]  Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[15484.57s -> 15484.89s]  Fuck.
[15485.85s -> 15491.90s]  There's so much stuff in here.
[15491.90s -> 15495.74s]  What am I supposed to do about this?
[15495.74s -> 15497.02s]  Look at all the stuff that's back here.
[15497.58s -> 15502.32s]  They have light over here.
[15502.32s -> 15502.64s]  I know.
[15502.64s -> 15504.08s]  But there's so much cool stuff.
[15508.35s -> 15508.83s]  I guess I could...
[15508.83s -> 15510.51s]  Can I go around the other side?
[15510.51s -> 15511.71s]  Moss arrows?
[15511.71s -> 15513.79s]  That's a good idea.
[15513.79s -> 15514.59s]  That's a really...
[15514.59s -> 15515.87s]  That's actually a brilliant idea.
[15535.28s -> 15546.41s]  Oh, what do I do?
[15546.41s -> 15553.13s]  Too jumpy.
[15553.13s -> 15561.45s]  Who's there?
[15561.45s -> 15562.97s]  Hey, there's an intruder here.
[15572.04s -> 15572.76s]  Whatever.
[15572.76s -> 15573.72s]  I'm just gonna leave.
[15573.72s -> 15580.43s]  What's with this light?
[15581.92s -> 15582.16s]  Dude.
[15582.16s -> 15582.80s]  I thought I saw something.
[15582.80s -> 15599.85s]  Guess it was nothing.
[15599.85s -> 15601.85s]  Did I just see what I think I saw?
[15603.45s -> 15606.35s]  Stay right there, Garrett.
[15607.07s -> 15612.35s]  Oh, shit.
[15612.99s -> 15619.85s]  I'm a genius, I think.
[15620.49s -> 15622.96s]  Oh, he's got a gold key.
[15622.96s -> 15623.36s]  All right.
[15623.36s -> 15623.92s]  Let me in.
[15623.92s -> 15624.40s]  Oh, my God.
[15624.40s -> 15624.72s]  I figured...
[15624.72s -> 15628.25s]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[15628.25s -> 15630.01s]  I'm stuck on the guy's body.
[15630.01s -> 15632.83s]  I'm stuck on his body.
[15632.83s -> 15633.87s]  Get off his body, please.
[15634.59s -> 15641.95s]  Cut up.
[15646.43s -> 15665.36s]  Okay, I got the one.
[15665.36s -> 15666.24s]  I don't care.
[15666.24s -> 15673.34s]  Oh, shit.
[15673.34s -> 15674.38s]  Oh, shit.
[15674.38s -> 15675.02s]  Oh, shit.
[15676.09s -> 15676.81s]  Oh, shit.
[15677.76s -> 15678.48s]  Oh, shit.
[15678.48s -> 15679.44s]  Don't hurt me.
[15679.44s -> 15680.24s]  Oh, shit.
[15680.80s -> 15681.44s]  Oh, shit.
[15681.44s -> 15681.92s]  Don't hurt me.
[15682.48s -> 15683.74s]  Oh, shit.
[15683.74s -> 15689.00s]  Get away, get away, get away, get away.
[15689.00s -> 15690.44s]  Don't get away with the explosion.
[15690.44s -> 15701.31s]  I can't go over there.
[15701.31s -> 15707.23s]  Walk on that.
[15707.23s -> 15708.35s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[15708.35s -> 15714.19s]  Don't turn the alarm on.
[15714.19s -> 15714.51s]  Got him.
[15715.71s -> 15728.99s]  Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.
[15728.99s -> 15729.55s]  Hide.
[15729.55s -> 15731.07s]  Hide, hide.
[15731.07s -> 15732.19s]  Hide, hide, hide.
[15732.19s -> 15738.89s]  He's gonna step on the landmine.
[15738.89s -> 15750.56s]  I'm good.
[15750.56s -> 15754.32s]  You stepped on a landmine, my friend.
[15754.32s -> 15756.96s]  You stepped on a landmine and you're fine?
[15767.76s -> 15769.28s]  Thank God you have potion on you.
[15769.28s -> 15774.72s]  Can I, like, get rid of their bodies?
[15776.48s -> 15783.82s]  I don't think this works.
[15783.82s -> 15784.86s]  I'm gonna drink that potion.
[15784.86s -> 15792.28s]  What's going on?
[15792.28s -> 15795.00s]  What's going on?
[15795.80s -> 15801.12s]  Oh, my God, you have money.
[15801.12s -> 15815.93s]  What's happening?
[15815.93s -> 15816.89s]  Wait, are they not...
[15816.89s -> 15817.77s]  I thought they were dead.
[15817.77s -> 15820.97s]  They're only knocked out?
[15820.97s -> 15824.32s]  I thought you said I was killing people.
[15824.96s -> 15826.40s]  I didn't know I was doing this.
[15826.40s -> 15834.67s]  I thought I was just getting rid of the bodies.
[15834.67s -> 15835.31s]  Okay.
[15835.31s -> 15848.97s]  Oh, he sees me.
[15849.61s -> 15850.49s]  He sees me.
[15850.49s -> 15852.76s]  The other guy's just blocking him.
[15852.76s -> 15853.56s]  Secret!
[15853.56s -> 15872.51s]  Can't break that.
[15872.51s -> 15873.63s]  Water arrow, please.
[15892.17s -> 15892.89s]  I'm not gonna do it.
[15892.89s -> 15895.05s]  I promised I wouldn't do it ever again.
[15895.05s -> 15895.61s]  Didn't he have...
[15895.61s -> 15896.65s]  Yeah, okay, I got it, right?
[15896.65s -> 15904.32s]  I got it.
[15904.32s -> 15910.99s]  All right, secret in the fireplace.
[15910.99s -> 15914.35s]  Use the back door, 47, if you must visit.
[15914.35s -> 15917.16s]  I don't give a damn what it does to your clothes.
[15917.16s -> 15919.96s]  I will not risk Ruben's scum following you in.
[15919.96s -> 15924.14s]  Until I get my key back and the vase sitting on my mantelpiece,
[15924.14s -> 15926.22s]  you're just going to have to tolerate the inconvenience.
[15928.04s -> 15947.42s]  I need the sapphire vase and I need a thousand bucks.
[15947.42s -> 15949.28s]  Sapphire vase.
[15949.28s -> 15950.40s]  Where would I be?
[15950.40s -> 15951.96s]  What an awful map.
[15951.96s -> 15953.64s]  I might as well just guess.
[15953.64s -> 15967.10s]  I have absolutely no idea where this would be.
[15967.10s -> 15971.48s]  So Overlord's Fancy?
[15971.48s -> 15976.54s]  I wonder...
[15976.54s -> 15977.50s]  In the fire.
[15977.50s -> 15979.66s]  Hold on.
[15979.66s -> 15983.93s]  Did he go over here?
[15983.93s -> 15986.27s]  He did not, okay.
[15995.32s -> 15999.60s]  He doesn't know where I am.
[15999.60s -> 16014.24s]  You wuss.
[16016.59s -> 16017.31s]  Wuss!
[16017.31s -> 16024.72s]  Don't let that guy ring the bell!
[16024.72s -> 16026.72s]  Why do you have to just run all over the place?
[16026.72s -> 16038.35s]  What are you doing?
[16039.16s -> 16040.20s]  Okay, I'm fine.
[16040.20s -> 16053.42s]  I'm supposed to be a dead lady too.
[16053.42s -> 16065.42s]  Let me give it to you straight.
[16065.42s -> 16068.54s]  The guy that you work for is a real bad guy.
[16068.54s -> 16070.51s]  He's a mean person.
[16070.51s -> 16072.25s]  He's corrupt.
[16072.25s -> 16074.41s]  He has all kinds of awful shit going on.
[16074.41s -> 16076.22s]  I'm just telling you right now,
[16077.02s -> 16078.78s]  I'm giving you an opportunity for you to go,
[16078.78s -> 16080.22s]  for you to get out and leave.
[16080.78s -> 16082.46s]  I'm going to take a bunch of shit from this guy
[16082.46s -> 16083.50s]  because he's a bad guy.
[16083.50s -> 16086.30s]  Someone's searching for something and we'll get the tap.
[16086.30s -> 16088.03s]  Exactly what I'm talking about.
[16088.03s -> 16088.43s]  Exactly.
[16088.43s -> 16089.79s]  So you and I are on the same page.
[16091.29s -> 16092.73s]  I mean, if you feel like it,
[16092.73s -> 16094.81s]  you can just kind of forget that I was here
[16094.81s -> 16096.81s]  and we can just go on with our days.
[16096.81s -> 16101.44s]  Yeah, there's a dead guy right here, but don't worry.
[16101.44s -> 16103.12s]  I'm not going to shoot another arrow at you.
[16103.12s -> 16111.80s]  I know this is going to be really gruesome,
[16111.80s -> 16113.00s]  but this is just how it is.
[16113.74s -> 16114.54s]  Welcome to the business.
[16115.92s -> 16117.28s]  I don't know if you knew this person or not,
[16117.28s -> 16119.28s]  but they were potentially bad.
[16120.00s -> 16121.28s]  They were trying to shoot me with arrows.
[16121.84s -> 16123.85s]  I thought we had an understanding.
[16123.85s -> 16125.07s]  I thought we had an understanding.
[16125.87s -> 16126.83s]  I thought we had an understanding.
[16127.39s -> 16145.37s]  How do I get down here?
[16146.65s -> 16149.37s]  Over here, he has a sword.
[16149.37s -> 16151.53s]  Oh, yes.
[16151.53s -> 16152.33s]  Hi.
[16152.33s -> 16152.89s]  How are you?
[16153.61s -> 16154.81s]  There ain't nobody left.
[16156.54s -> 16157.66s]  All the guards are dead.
[16158.59s -> 16159.63s]  I just, you know what?
[16159.63s -> 16160.91s]  I'm just trying to help here.
[16161.85s -> 16162.89s]  There's nobody left.
[16162.89s -> 16164.49s]  I killed all the guards.
[16164.49s -> 16165.37s]  Yes, I have a sword.
[16165.37s -> 16166.65s]  Yes, I have a bow and arrow.
[16166.65s -> 16167.53s]  I'm not going to hurt you.
[16168.49s -> 16169.61s]  I'm not going to.
[16169.61s -> 16170.25s]  Please leave.
[16171.53s -> 16173.45s]  Go into like a Minecraft gold dungeon.
[16176.19s -> 16177.23s]  Oh, holy shit.
[16177.23s -> 16178.99s]  Oh my God, you led me to the sacred room.
[16180.97s -> 16184.33s]  Uh, Davey, till Dono and Ruben quit their bitching,
[16184.33s -> 16186.09s]  best we just stick to our own turf.
[16186.09s -> 16193.92s]  I'm too much Dono's man to risk it.
[16193.92s -> 16201.87s]  All right.
[16201.87s -> 16203.63s]  He has a sword.
[16206.41s -> 16208.09s]  This lady, I swear to God.
[16218.09s -> 16220.33s]  Okay, I've not gone down here yet.
[16220.33s -> 16220.89s]  Let's save it.
[16227.77s -> 16230.41s]  I wonder if there's something down here.
[16230.41s -> 16260.09s]  This doesn't open.
[16260.09s -> 16262.76s]  Where am I going?
[16262.76s -> 16264.56s]  It's the creature.
[16264.56s -> 16266.08s]  This creature, it's a spider.
[16266.08s -> 16266.72s]  Relax.
[16266.72s -> 16274.60s]  It's loud.
[16274.60s -> 16275.64s]  I can't break those though.
[16275.64s -> 16282.43s]  Am I going the right way?
[16282.43s -> 16291.58s]  Dude, okay.
[16291.58s -> 16295.60s]  I have no idea.
[16295.60s -> 16296.78s]  I hope this is the right way.
[16315.18s -> 16316.86s]  I couldn't do anything about that.
[16317.92s -> 16318.42s]  Thank you.
[16329.31s -> 16330.43s]  I said I heard vase.
[16330.43s -> 16331.47s]  I heard vase action.
[16338.94s -> 16339.66s]  I heard vase.
[16340.22s -> 16344.96s]  Holy shit, you're awful.
[16345.68s -> 16346.16s]  Oh, okay.
[16346.16s -> 16347.12s]  You got me with that one.
[16347.12s -> 16347.92s]  That one was in the head.
[16348.56s -> 16349.52s]  That one was in the face.
[16352.03s -> 16353.15s]  Yeah, that was actually not bad.
[16353.71s -> 16354.43s]  That was not bad.
[16355.72s -> 16356.60s]  But now you pissed me off.
[16360.92s -> 16380.00s]  Climb the ladder.
[16380.00s -> 16381.16s]  All right.
[16381.16s -> 16382.52s]  Vase is down here somewhere.
[16382.52s -> 16395.64s]  My god.
[16413.07s -> 16413.63s]  Huh?
[16413.63s -> 16422.48s]  Oh, now you have a sword.
[16422.48s -> 16432.86s]  I don't like it.
[16432.86s -> 16435.37s]  Stop running.
[16435.37s -> 16436.41s]  Stop running.
[16436.41s -> 16437.37s]  Open this door.
[16437.37s -> 16439.36s]  Open this door right now.
[16439.36s -> 16446.04s]  Open this door right now.
[16446.04s -> 16457.60s]  Shit.
[16457.60s -> 16459.04s]  I'm actually kind of glad I got stuck.
[16459.04s -> 16461.96s]  Anybody have the keys on them?
[16461.96s -> 16462.52s]  No.
[16462.52s -> 16465.18s]  I need health.
[16465.18s -> 16465.82s]  Cucumber.
[16470.54s -> 16471.18s]  Save it here.
[16471.18s -> 16473.80s]  Now, what is going on with this?
[16473.80s -> 16476.68s]  This is blocked.
[16476.68s -> 16483.40s]  47.
[16483.40s -> 16483.88s]  47.
[16483.88s -> 16485.48s]  What does it say something about 47?
[16485.48s -> 16486.36s]  What was it?
[16486.36s -> 16492.54s]  I have to get in here.
[16492.54s -> 16495.88s]  I can't get in here though.
[16498.64s -> 16499.52s]  Is there a drill?
[16499.52s -> 16515.45s]  I think I got to go this way.
[16529.15s -> 16545.68s]  What do you want me to tell you?
[16545.68s -> 16553.34s]  Like, I gave her like 100 opportunities to leave.
[16553.34s -> 16555.90s]  She's just yelling and she's going to get attention called to here.
[16555.90s -> 16556.22s]  All right.
[16556.22s -> 16557.98s]  Now, what do I need to do?
[16558.62s -> 16561.45s]  I need the sapphire vase.
[16561.45s -> 16562.89s]  47 is over here.
[16562.89s -> 16567.23s]  What do I do with this though?
[16567.23s -> 16568.35s]  I can go over.
[16568.99s -> 16569.39s]  I don't know.
[16570.03s -> 16576.96s]  There's a tunnel in the water.
[16577.60s -> 16580.27s]  You mean like down here?
[16580.27s -> 16584.01s]  Look at you.
[16584.81s -> 16592.06s]  Can I open that?
[16592.06s -> 16592.70s]  Can't open that.
[16596.06s -> 16597.02s]  100 opportunities.
[16597.02s -> 16597.26s]  I did.
[16597.26s -> 16598.06s]  I really did.
[16598.06s -> 16599.29s]  47.
[16599.29s -> 16599.61s]  There it is.
[16600.25s -> 16602.54s]  All right.
[16602.54s -> 16603.10s]  47.
[16603.66s -> 16609.84s]  47.
[16609.84s -> 16610.32s]  48.
[16610.88s -> 16616.28s]  What is this for?
[16616.28s -> 16622.28s]  Should I just do them both?
[16622.28s -> 16626.24s]  Is there something?
[16626.24s -> 16626.96s]  There are doors.
[16640.62s -> 16643.10s]  Open 48.
[16643.10s -> 16644.46s]  Literally writing in the wall.
[16644.46s -> 16645.10s]  Good puzzle.
[16645.10s -> 16646.68s]  I mean, yeah.
[16646.68s -> 16648.35s]  But so what?
[16648.35s -> 16653.24s]  Milk?
[16653.24s -> 16664.25s]  So I opened the door that's labeled 47.
[16664.25s -> 16665.85s]  I remember even a door labeled 47.
[16671.05s -> 16673.45s]  Get me out of the water.
[16673.45s -> 16675.95s]  What's this?
[16675.95s -> 16687.26s]  So I opened that.
[16687.26s -> 16688.81s]  Does that do anything?
[16688.81s -> 16690.25s]  Should up here or something?
[16690.25s -> 16690.65s]  I don't know.
[16694.84s -> 16695.08s]  Yeah.
[16695.08s -> 16695.96s]  47.
[16695.96s -> 16696.84s]  48.
[16696.84s -> 16705.56s]  Something back here?
[16705.56s -> 16706.60s]  I have no idea.
[16706.60s -> 16717.98s]  49.
[16717.98s -> 16718.70s]  Well, shit.
[16718.70s -> 16719.50s]  I don't know where to go.
[16719.50s -> 16722.67s]  I remember this level was really-
[16722.67s -> 16724.51s]  There's a window on the other end.
[16724.51s -> 16729.40s]  Two doors in tunnel from before.
[16729.40s -> 16730.04s]  Window.
[16730.04s -> 16732.52s]  Like back here?
[16740.04s -> 16742.89s]  Uh, like here?
[16742.89s -> 16747.93s]  What's over here?
[16751.87s -> 16753.23s]  Actually, unironically skip this.
[16753.23s -> 16754.19s]  This level sucks.
[16754.19s -> 16757.72s]  I think I just found it.
[16775.23s -> 16776.67s]  Nothing's so tame.
[16776.67s -> 16779.07s]  He can scarf out the way he came quick enough.
[16779.07s -> 16783.07s]  But he don't want to go till he sweeps everything on the dresser.
[16783.07s -> 16784.99s]  Jewelry, candlesticks, whatnot.
[16784.99s -> 16786.03s]  Into his sack.
[16786.03s -> 16787.87s]  Gets halfway down the stairs.
[16787.87s -> 16789.63s]  When the sack starts leaping about-
[16789.63s -> 16791.31s]  This is like Owen Wilson.
[16791.31s -> 16795.68s]  He's cut the lady's cat, too, from the sack.
[16795.68s -> 16798.00s]  Everything falls out except the cat.
[16798.00s -> 16800.72s]  And that's halfway up his arm with claws every which way.
[16803.34s -> 16805.98s]  He had to jump in the river to get the damn thing off.
[16806.54s -> 16809.74s]  Left a trail of blood and water over half the city just going home.
[16815.90s -> 16824.59s]  Oh, actually, I bugged the cutscene.
[16824.59s -> 16824.91s]  Perfect.
[16831.44s -> 16832.08s]  Hey.
[16832.08s -> 16838.40s]  Into the dark, into the dark.
[16838.40s -> 16838.96s]  Down, down, down.
[16838.96s -> 16841.85s]  Okay, save.
[16841.85s -> 16844.49s]  This guy was stealing something from the dressers.
[16866.14s -> 16867.26s]  I gotta get this other guy, too.
[16867.26s -> 16868.78s]  He walks all the way over here.
[16868.78s -> 16869.42s]  Watch.
[16869.42s -> 16887.28s]  Here we go.
[16887.28s -> 16888.08s]  No, he didn't see anything.
[16888.64s -> 16892.46s]  This is a good hiding spot.
[16893.10s -> 16894.67s]  I'm gonna use this as a hiding spot.
[16897.08s -> 16898.52s]  Yeah, this is a good spot to hide.
[16898.52s -> 16906.54s]  I can go even deeper or let me let me peruse this area first.
[16906.54s -> 16908.51s]  Probably something here.
[16908.51s -> 16928.35s]  Is that money behind the bed?
[16930.25s -> 16930.81s]  It is.
[16931.45s -> 16932.33s]  Very nice.
[16932.33s -> 16948.30s]  Explosive barrel.
[16948.30s -> 16948.94s]  Oh, come on.
[16948.94s -> 16951.42s]  I thought these were bags of like Scrooge McDuck money.
[16951.42s -> 16952.80s]  Whatever.
[16952.80s -> 16972.52s]  There he is.
[16972.52s -> 16973.08s]  Got him.
[16973.08s -> 16973.72s]  Thank God.
[16973.72s -> 16979.64s]  All right.
[16979.64s -> 16980.44s]  What's in here?
[16980.44s -> 16981.32s]  Nothing.
[16981.32s -> 16989.13s]  Why are the bricks sideways?
[16989.13s -> 16992.32s]  I don't know.
[16992.32s -> 17007.29s]  Anybody in here?
[17007.29s -> 17009.37s]  Treasure in here, though.
[17009.37s -> 17010.09s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[17012.83s -> 17014.43s]  I definitely have to be at the threshold now, right?
[17014.75s -> 17016.03s]  I don't have a thousand bucks yet.
[17016.03s -> 17016.59s]  How?
[17016.59s -> 17019.74s]  That seems impossible.
[17019.74s -> 17033.64s]  Can I get this one, too?
[17033.64s -> 17036.20s]  I can't unsee the vertical bricks now.
[17036.20s -> 17037.08s]  It's weird.
[17037.08s -> 17045.58s]  Oh, nice.
[17045.58s -> 17050.08s]  Don't throw a piece of dynamite in here, please.
[17050.08s -> 17050.64s]  Nothing?
[17050.64s -> 17054.14s]  What a terrible room.
[17054.14s -> 17054.70s]  Give me a break.
[17054.70s -> 17067.69s]  Too many imaginings.
[17070.57s -> 17071.29s]  It was real.
[17071.29s -> 17104.43s]  Don't think you can hide for-
[17104.43s -> 17105.23s]  Yeah, you-
[17105.23s -> 17108.01s]  We've got an intruder.
[17108.01s -> 17109.53s]  How have you not triggered this?
[17110.09s -> 17111.45s]  How have you not triggered this?
[17114.24s -> 17114.88s]  Excuse me.
[17114.88s -> 17123.24s]  I guess it was nothing.
[17123.24s -> 17129.04s]  What's that?
[17129.04s -> 17134.33s]  Oh, shit.
[17134.33s -> 17134.81s]  Someone's coming.
[17140.40s -> 17145.48s]  That I'm hidden?
[17145.48s -> 17145.96s]  No.
[17145.96s -> 17148.83s]  Skip this level.
[17148.83s -> 17149.55s]  I'm probably-
[17149.55s -> 17151.07s]  I'm almost at the end of the level, probably.
[17151.07s -> 17152.73s]  We're probably right at the end.
[17152.73s -> 17155.69s]  For the last time, tell the maid to stay out of the banner room
[17155.69s -> 17158.03s]  and don't touch anything in it.
[17158.03s -> 17160.11s]  It is the room where I can have peace of mind.
[17160.11s -> 17162.43s]  My collection is too precious to risk any clum-
[17162.43s -> 17164.22s]  Okay.
[17164.22s -> 17165.02s]  Any clum-liness.
[17165.74s -> 17171.04s]  So, hit the banner.
[17171.04s -> 17172.24s]  It's all of it.
[17172.24s -> 17173.12s]  Go to the banner room.
[17176.86s -> 17181.07s]  Oh, someone coming.
[17181.07s -> 17182.27s]  You're not even halfway.
[17183.20s -> 17183.84s]  You're not ha-
[17183.84s -> 17184.48s]  What?
[17184.48s -> 17185.68s]  How am I not halfway?
[17187.72s -> 17189.32s]  You're halfway through or less?
[17189.88s -> 17191.80s]  This mission is the worst.
[17192.99s -> 17193.79s]  How do I skip it?
[17197.02s -> 17198.06s]  I don't think I can skip this.
[17198.70s -> 17206.70s]  Press Ctrl-Alt-Shift and put your entire fist in your mouth.
[17207.34s -> 17217.39s]  Okay.
[17217.39s -> 17217.79s]  I'm right-
[17217.79s -> 17218.99s]  Look, I'm in the guy's quarters.
[17228.86s -> 17229.58s]  What's going on?
[17230.14s -> 17231.10s]  How are you?
[17231.10s -> 17232.96s]  Nice to see you.
[17232.96s -> 17235.28s]  Somebody hear that?
[17235.28s -> 17252.60s]  Right there.
[17252.60s -> 17253.64s]  Oh, no.
[17253.64s -> 17254.36s]  Sorry.
[17254.36s -> 17261.20s]  Line aside him.
[17261.20s -> 17266.27s]  See you later.
[17266.27s -> 17277.64s]  Who's the next guy?
[17277.64s -> 17289.34s]  All right.
[17289.34s -> 17290.06s]  I'm up here now.
[17290.06s -> 17290.62s]  Private quarters.
[17290.62s -> 17297.66s]  Let's go.
[17297.66s -> 17297.98s]  All right.
[17297.98s -> 17299.10s]  What's this dude's name?
[17299.10s -> 17302.81s]  I don't know.
[17330.44s -> 17333.45s]  Hey!
[17333.45s -> 17334.17s]  Get-
[17334.17s -> 17336.75s]  Oh my god.
[17346.44s -> 17349.12s]  Stop splashing around.
[17349.12s -> 17349.92s]  Oh, you idiot.
[17353.18s -> 17356.60s]  What'd he say?
[17356.60s -> 17362.44s]  Where are you?
[17362.44s -> 17362.68s]  Okay.
[17362.68s -> 17363.40s]  Here he is.
[17363.40s -> 17377.45s]  All right.
[17377.45s -> 17378.25s]  Don't touch my things.
[17378.25s -> 17379.37s]  Don't touch my things, right?
[17379.37s -> 17380.57s]  Don't touch my things.
[17380.57s -> 17402.11s]  Where's the key?
[17417.87s -> 17422.27s]  Remember, did you plug in the smelloscope for this game?
[17422.27s -> 17424.51s]  You needed to clear some levels.
[17424.51s -> 17431.52s]  Oh.
[17433.10s -> 17435.58s]  You can't be serious.
[17435.58s -> 17437.66s]  Not when I'm this far into the game.
[17437.66s -> 17458.16s]  Who makes doors that open like this?
[17458.16s -> 17458.48s]  Why?
[17459.44s -> 17461.44s]  Open the whole fucking way.
[17479.72s -> 17481.00s]  How do I open this?
[17481.00s -> 17491.82s]  That's the safe right there.
[17492.38s -> 17494.38s]  I need a key to get in there or something.
[17494.38s -> 17496.06s]  Is it in his room?
[17496.06s -> 17497.79s]  With a key.
[17497.79s -> 17498.75s]  With a lockpick.
[17498.75s -> 17500.19s]  Key in the other house.
[17500.19s -> 17506.80s]  I mean, other house.
[17506.80s -> 17507.52s]  Note.
[17507.52s -> 17510.80s]  This is possibly the most complicated map in the game.
[17510.80s -> 17513.84s]  From conversations or scrolls, you can easily miss-
[17513.84s -> 17514.32s]  Hold on.
[17514.32s -> 17515.72s]  This is important.
[17515.72s -> 17516.44s]  You can easily miss.
[17516.44s -> 17517.64s]  You will gain the following knowledge.
[17517.64s -> 17521.08s]  Donald has Lord Randall's vase locked in his private safe in the West.
[17522.41s -> 17526.33s]  Ruben has stolen the key to Donald's safe.
[17526.33s -> 17530.60s]  He's also entrusted his house key to his right-hand man, Tom.
[17530.60s -> 17534.30s]  You must first find Tom, get the key to Ruben's house,
[17534.30s -> 17536.22s]  steal Donald's safe key from Ruben's quarters,
[17536.22s -> 17538.38s]  then retrieve the vase from Donald's safe, bro.
[17538.38s -> 17544.32s]  I'm in the wrong house?
[17544.32s -> 17546.48s]  Is there a console command to skip the game?
[17558.00s -> 17559.28s]  What's the console command?
[17559.28s -> 17561.87s]  Just play the game.
[17561.87s -> 17562.51s]  All right.
[17562.51s -> 17566.38s]  All right.
[17566.38s -> 17567.90s]  Well, I know where this guy's house is.
[17567.90s -> 17569.66s]  The other house on the other side of the game?
[17570.22s -> 17576.67s]  This is Suncoast Ballacy.
[17577.31s -> 17578.27s]  Are you having fun?
[17578.75s -> 17579.47s]  Yeah, kind of.
[17584.14s -> 17584.54s]  Okay.
[17584.54s -> 17586.54s]  Control-Alt-Shift-End.
[17586.54s -> 17587.90s]  That's not how that-
[17587.90s -> 17588.78s]  You made that up.
[17589.34s -> 17591.42s]  Control-Alt-Shift-End.
[17592.38s -> 17594.30s]  As you made that up as a funny joke.
[17594.30s -> 17595.90s]  Control-Shift-Alt-End?
[17598.88s -> 17599.68s]  I feel like it's gonna-
[17599.68s -> 17600.96s]  It's gonna do-
[17600.96s -> 17606.27s]  Control-Shift-Alt-End.
[17606.27s -> 17616.12s]  I feel like I could have accidentally pressed all those
[17616.12s -> 17617.16s]  at some point in the game.
[17631.60s -> 17632.16s]  I'm sorry.
[17632.16s -> 17633.28s]  I skipped it.
[17633.28s -> 17636.19s]  Everyone told me to skip it.
[17636.19s -> 17637.23s]  Look, this is an old game.
[17637.23s -> 17639.31s]  Sometimes old games have, like, hard, weird levels.
[17643.90s -> 17649.44s]  A lot of people in chat were saying
[17649.44s -> 17651.28s]  this next level is, like, the best level in the game.
[17651.28s -> 17652.00s]  I was content-
[17652.00s -> 17656.04s]  How many levels are in the game?
[17656.04s -> 17664.22s]  Who impressed me to steal something from a magical soul?
[17664.22s -> 17674.30s]  Little is known about Constantine except that he is an eccentric new face in the city,
[17674.94s -> 17676.46s]  and mostly keeps to himself.
[17677.26s -> 17678.62s]  This next level is a skipper.
[17678.62s -> 17682.14s]  Victorious says the sword will probably be-
[17682.14s -> 17682.62s]  We'll see.
[17682.62s -> 17683.66s]  It will be well-protected-
[17683.66s -> 17684.78s]  I now have that power.
[17684.78s -> 17686.30s]  Security systems.
[17686.30s -> 17688.30s]  She also mentioned that the guards are tough,
[17688.38s -> 17692.52s]  and our mansion is confusing to navigate in.
[17693.16s -> 17694.36s]  They're telling me it's confusing already.
[17694.36s -> 17695.48s]  This place was constructed recently,
[17695.48s -> 17699.58s]  so I've had to pull an observation and hearsay.
[17700.40s -> 17702.80s]  Sounds like the place is a bit of a maze.
[17702.80s -> 17705.77s]  I guess if you're rich enough, you can build any sort of madhouse.
[17705.77s -> 17706.49s]  It's a maze?
[17707.29s -> 17710.35s]  This is gonna be a challenging job,
[17710.35s -> 17712.88s]  but it'll pay the last few I've taken.
[17712.88s -> 17713.68s]  Skip.
[17713.68s -> 17715.76s]  Well, I know I can at least complete the game by skipping.
[17715.76s -> 17721.36s]  As usual, the front entrance managed to find another-
[17721.36s -> 17722.24s]  This game is fun, though.
[17722.24s -> 17722.64s]  This is cool.
[17722.64s -> 17725.44s]  Of course, once I've picked up the sword, I'll still have to worry about-
[17725.44s -> 17728.78s]  You guys have to remember, this game was made in, like, 1989.
[17729.34s -> 17730.30s]  Or something.
[17730.30s -> 17731.34s]  It was a long time ago.
[17732.73s -> 17733.23s]  Okay.
[17733.61s -> 17734.81s]  Find and obtain the sword.
[17734.81s -> 17736.57s]  It's probably on an upper level of the mansion.
[17737.13s -> 17738.97s]  Take the opportunity to steal other valuables.
[17738.97s -> 17740.17s]  Leave the mansion with the sword.
[17740.73s -> 17747.02s]  A lot of stuff.
[17747.58s -> 17749.96s]  I want more of these.
[17750.52s -> 17760.88s]  How much do these cost?
[17764.33s -> 17765.85s]  Uh, another mine?
[17765.85s -> 17766.81s]  No, the bombs-
[17766.81s -> 17767.45s]  They just don't do-
[17767.45s -> 17768.97s]  This caused a lot of problems.
[17768.97s -> 17769.77s]  The mines suck.
[17770.59s -> 17771.39s]  They're loud.
[17771.39s -> 17772.99s]  They don't go off right away.
[17772.99s -> 17773.63s]  They're terrible.
[17777.39s -> 17778.91s]  And flashes flash me, too.
[17778.91s -> 17779.71s]  They're awful.
[17779.79s -> 17781.39s]  You know, I'm just gonna get more fire arrows.
[17781.39s -> 17782.11s]  Just get another one.
[17783.61s -> 17785.05s]  These at least kill people.
[17785.05s -> 17791.48s]  But I probably should get a heal-
[17791.48s -> 17792.44s]  Okay, yeah, another potion.
[17792.44s -> 17793.08s]  I need a potion.
[17797.39s -> 17806.03s]  All right, let's go.
[17806.03s -> 17806.67s]  All right.
[17806.67s -> 17808.11s]  Get into the mansion.
[17808.91s -> 17809.87s]  Steal the sword.
[17809.87s -> 17810.35s]  You got it.
[17821.45s -> 17822.89s]  And there's a guarded entrance right-
[17841.31s -> 17842.57s]  This is perfect.
[17842.57s -> 17843.13s]  Come back here.
[17844.22s -> 17844.62s]  Perfect.
[17845.26s -> 17846.30s]  You can't see shit.
[17846.30s -> 17846.86s]  Come back here.
[17847.82s -> 17848.70s]  Don't come this close.
[17848.70s -> 17849.50s]  Thank you very much.
[17849.50s -> 17850.22s]  I'll take that.
[17850.22s -> 17850.70s]  Thank you.
[17850.70s -> 17852.46s]  I don't see anything now.
[17852.46s -> 17857.04s]  Wait till he turns around.
[17858.12s -> 17860.52s]  I say, where'd you come from?
[17860.52s -> 17862.28s]  And I'd like to know what happened there.
[17878.32s -> 17878.80s]  He saw-
[17878.80s -> 17879.84s]  Wait, he saw me run?
[17879.84s -> 17889.08s]  Are you scared?
[17889.08s -> 17894.65s]  Ooh, not very good swordsman, are you?
[17905.34s -> 17905.84s]  Aha.
[17908.20s -> 17911.39s]  Nice key you got there.
[17915.42s -> 17924.72s]  I love how, like, when something happens,
[17926.08s -> 17927.60s]  I like look to-
[17927.60s -> 17929.92s]  I like look over to you, right?
[17929.92s -> 17930.88s]  I like look to you.
[17931.84s -> 17933.28s]  Almost like I can't believe it,
[17933.28s -> 17935.68s]  so you must not be able to believe it either.
[17935.68s -> 17937.12s]  I'm looking at you like you're a person.
[17938.00s -> 17940.88s]  Like, can you believe what just happened?
[17941.44s -> 17944.11s]  I'm over here for reassurance
[17944.75s -> 17945.87s]  that, like, I'll turn
[17945.87s -> 17947.39s]  and I'll see, like, a bunch of-
[17947.39s -> 17949.71s]  Oh my god, dude, that was fucked up.
[17949.71s -> 17981.95s]  Come get me.
[17982.51s -> 17988.83s]  Try sneaking.
[17988.83s -> 17990.03s]  That's a good trick.
[17990.03s -> 17998.62s]  I got the key off of you.
[17998.62s -> 17998.94s]  All right.
[18004.04s -> 18005.88s]  I'm just going in the front door, man.
[18005.88s -> 18014.16s]  Whoa.
[18014.16s -> 18014.96s]  What was that?
[18014.96s -> 18020.65s]  Oops.
[18029.07s -> 18030.03s]  Oh, shut up.
[18030.75s -> 18036.41s]  I've already used so much health already.
[18036.41s -> 18048.54s]  It's bad news.
[18048.54s -> 18049.66s]  All right, I'm in.
[18049.66s -> 18052.41s]  I got in the front door, though.
[18052.41s -> 18057.74s]  Now we slow down.
[18057.74s -> 18059.42s]  Be careful with everything.
[18059.42s -> 18061.96s]  I steal a bunch of stuff.
[18061.96s -> 18063.42s]  All right, nice.
[18063.42s -> 18067.84s]  I'm gonna come in-
[18067.84s -> 18072.12s]  Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[18072.12s -> 18073.32s]  Right when I open the door, he's there.
[18073.96s -> 18080.00s]  You sidestepped me.
[18080.72s -> 18082.40s]  I got sidestepped.
[18082.40s -> 18094.27s]  He just led me to the treasure chest.
[18094.27s -> 18095.45s]  What a dope.
[18095.45s -> 18115.47s]  This is the main entrance here.
[18115.47s -> 18116.43s]  We're gonna wrap this way.
[18116.43s -> 18118.51s]  So the sword is up in the top floor.
[18118.51s -> 18125.61s]  The same room.
[18125.61s -> 18134.19s]  A big vase.
[18134.19s -> 18152.04s]  Stairs- I'm not done yet.
[18152.44s -> 18153.96s]  I think there's more stuff here than there is.
[18153.96s -> 18160.30s]  It's all just bottles.
[18160.30s -> 18160.94s]  That's it.
[18160.94s -> 18164.62s]  Oh, this is pretty.
[18164.62s -> 18168.49s]  That's really pretty.
[18168.49s -> 18178.92s]  Who's hearing me?
[18190.40s -> 18201.34s]  Get out of my way.
[18201.34s -> 18203.02s]  Why am I stuck on the chandelier still?
[18203.02s -> 18203.50s]  All right.
[18203.50s -> 18205.18s]  I'm just going the way that I was supposed to go.
[18205.18s -> 18206.14s]  And it's this way.
[18206.14s -> 18213.18s]  Take out the club.
[18213.18s -> 18213.66s]  Let's go.
[18213.66s -> 18221.72s]  What a weird-
[18221.72s -> 18223.88s]  I feel like I'm on the set of a Nickelodeon sitcom.
[18223.88s -> 18225.00s]  Like, what is this?
[18225.00s -> 18229.12s]  This is kind of creepy.
[18229.12s -> 18239.84s]  Info right here.
[18239.84s -> 18241.56s]  What does it say?
[18241.56s -> 18247.72s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18247.72s -> 18253.24s]  That's weird.
[18253.24s -> 18254.80s]  That's weird.
[18254.80s -> 18256.40s]  That's a weird door to have in your house.
[18256.40s -> 18257.52s]  That's very strange.
[18262.04s -> 18262.52s]  Oh my god.
[18262.52s -> 18264.20s]  I thought it was speaking to me.
[18264.20s -> 18277.82s]  It's weird.
[18277.82s -> 18279.82s]  It's definitely a hidden thing in here, no doubt.
[18279.82s -> 18283.21s]  They have things that shoot out of their mouths.
[18283.21s -> 18291.00s]  Don't move.
[18291.00s -> 18291.80s]  This is tripped.
[18291.80s -> 18297.16s]  Yeah, this is trapped.
[18297.16s -> 18298.11s]  You know what?
[18298.11s -> 18298.67s]  I'm good.
[18298.67s -> 18303.85s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[18303.85s -> 18304.33s]  Definitely.
[18304.33s -> 18305.05s]  Where is it?
[18305.05s -> 18312.04s]  In like gold nugget up here.
[18312.04s -> 18314.51s]  That it?
[18314.51s -> 18317.82s]  Pretty good.
[18317.82s -> 18320.01s]  I think that's it.
[18320.01s -> 18334.80s]  It's gold rock.
[18334.80s -> 18336.16s]  Dr. Seuss house.
[18336.16s -> 18338.96s]  I don't like this place.
[18338.96s -> 18339.76s]  I heard a shot.
[18340.72s -> 18346.12s]  I was in a really good place.
[18346.12s -> 18353.05s]  I gotta stop yelling too.
[18353.05s -> 18355.80s]  I'm just like yelling for no reason.
[18355.80s -> 18357.72s]  I'm just making loud sounds.
[18357.80s -> 18358.84s]  Like, I heard a shot!
[18358.84s -> 18360.76s]  Like, you could just say that you heard a shot.
[18360.76s -> 18363.50s]  You don't have to yell it into the microphone.
[18363.50s -> 18364.22s]  They're all here.
[18364.22s -> 18364.78s]  They're watching.
[18364.78s -> 18365.66s]  They can see.
[18365.66s -> 18376.80s]  You said you were going to be a normal person and not be a weirdo anymore.
[18376.80s -> 18380.14s]  I mean, I think that went out the window.
[18380.14s -> 18381.85s]  I tried.
[18381.85s -> 18382.89s]  That was my New Year's resolution.
[18382.89s -> 18384.57s]  But all New Year's resolutions don't work.
[18384.57s -> 18386.17s]  I did it for like a day.
[18386.97s -> 18394.89s]  Is this a meltdown stream?
[18395.53s -> 18397.45s]  I don't think so.
[18398.92s -> 18399.40s]  No way.
[18400.84s -> 18405.76s]  I mean, I've been a little active, but I've been active.
[18405.76s -> 18406.96s]  I wouldn't say this is a meltdown.
[18406.96s -> 18407.68s]  It's not even close.
[18408.16s -> 18410.32s]  I'm just kind of having fun with the video game.
[18410.88s -> 18414.65s]  I already went down there.
[18414.65s -> 18418.70s]  It's going to shoot again, isn't it?
[18425.02s -> 18425.52s]  Oh!
[18426.94s -> 18433.52s]  Oh, that was fucked.
[18433.52s -> 18440.94s]  Oh, this wall.
[18440.94s -> 18445.74s]  That scared the shit out of me.
[18445.74s -> 18446.14s]  What do you think?
[18446.14s -> 18447.34s]  How do you think I feel?
[18447.34s -> 18448.70s]  It happened to me.
[18448.70s -> 18450.96s]  What do you think?
[18450.96s -> 18451.76s]  How do you think I feel?
[18452.56s -> 18453.76s]  It happened to me.
[18453.76s -> 18457.53s]  I'm the one that got hit by the car.
[18459.12s -> 18460.88s]  You watched me get hit by the car.
[18460.88s -> 18472.80s]  I had to get hit by the car.
[18472.80s -> 18474.72s]  Your scream was scarier than the thing.
[18474.72s -> 18478.56s]  Okay, don't.
[18478.56s -> 18479.52s]  I gotta be careful.
[18479.52s -> 18485.34s]  All right, don't get trolled by the stupid joke room.
[18485.34s -> 18486.14s]  All right, go ahead.
[18486.14s -> 18487.18s]  Three, two, one, shoot it.
[18495.95s -> 18497.71s]  What the hell am I doing?
[18506.88s -> 18507.60s]  Is it turn?
[18507.60s -> 18515.90s]  Oh, all right.
[18515.90s -> 18518.62s]  This Charlie and the Chocolate Factory fun house.
[18518.62s -> 18526.11s]  Wait, will he get hit by this?
[18529.02s -> 18530.22s]  This will shoot him, right?
[18530.22s -> 18550.32s]  Someone will.
[18550.32s -> 18552.33s]  Whoa, what's down here?
[18552.33s -> 18571.52s]  Okay, where's he going?
[18571.52s -> 18586.14s]  Oh, fuck.
[18586.14s -> 18587.10s]  Oh, fuck.
[18606.00s -> 18606.88s]  That was do or die right there.
[18606.88s -> 18607.44s]  I had to do that.
[18607.44s -> 18608.32s]  Oh, it was over.
[18608.32s -> 18628.27s]  Where is this guy?
[18628.27s -> 18628.91s]  Down here?
[18628.91s -> 18636.56s]  Oh, shit.
[18636.56s -> 18638.88s]  Oh, that hurts right in the head.
[18638.88s -> 18648.24s]  All right, we're good.
[18648.24s -> 18655.92s]  I want to go in that weird door on the ground.
[18657.12s -> 18658.32s]  What am I doing?
[18658.32s -> 18660.00s]  Is there a second floor, third floor?
[18660.00s -> 18661.28s]  What am I doing here?
[18661.28s -> 18666.67s]  Should I go in there?
[18666.67s -> 18673.39s]  You can cheese guards.
[18717.12s -> 18717.76s]  Shoot him.
[18719.55s -> 18730.08s]  You just sounded like Finn from Adventure Time.
[18730.08s -> 18739.26s]  This place, fuck this level.
[18739.26s -> 18740.78s]  This level sucks.
[18740.78s -> 18750.00s]  This is, it's just like a trap fun house.
[18750.00s -> 18750.56s]  What is this?
[18750.56s -> 18751.84s]  All right, I guess I'll walk over here
[18751.84s -> 18753.84s]  and get eaten alive by the monsters.
[18753.84s -> 18756.48s]  Get off of me.
[18756.48s -> 18777.34s]  This place is huge.
[18777.34s -> 18786.99s]  I gotta go up.
[18786.99s -> 18788.19s]  There's the bug room.
[18788.19s -> 18797.69s]  Okay, let's open this one with a pick lock.
[18797.69s -> 18804.19s]  Where are we at?
[18804.19s -> 18804.83s]  Gash.
[18804.83s -> 18806.78s]  Very nice.
[18806.78s -> 18817.23s]  All right, am I on the top floor?
[18817.23s -> 18818.11s]  No.
[18818.11s -> 18819.85s]  Where's the, there's another floor?
[18819.85s -> 18820.33s]  Where?
[18820.33s -> 18822.51s]  This looks like the top floor.
[18822.51s -> 18848.52s]  What happened to those people?
[18848.52s -> 18859.23s]  Okay, nice.
[18859.23s -> 18865.47s]  I gotta find a staircase up.
[18865.47s -> 18870.40s]  Secret in the fireplace.
[18872.08s -> 18872.56s]  I think there might be.
[18872.56s -> 18873.28s]  Look at that.
[18873.28s -> 18873.76s]  Right above.
[18873.76s -> 18881.55s]  Looks like a button.
[18881.55s -> 18882.35s]  Place, shit goes.
[18882.35s -> 18884.01s]  Okay, whatever.
[18884.01s -> 18894.33s]  Hello.
[18894.33s -> 18895.37s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[18895.37s -> 18913.42s]  All right, I gotta find a staircase.
[18913.42s -> 18915.26s]  This is the main entrance.
[18915.26s -> 18921.31s]  This goes down, I believe.
[18921.31s -> 18925.02s]  Yeah, so I gotta go up and in here.
[18925.02s -> 18926.14s]  I've been pretty much everywhere.
[18926.14s -> 18927.36s]  I've been everywhere.
[18932.30s -> 18933.50s]  I can go up from here.
[18933.50s -> 18937.56s]  Oh, you unlucky bastard.
[18939.05s -> 18940.41s]  I don't know how you turned around.
[18940.41s -> 18947.95s]  Give me that key right now.
[18947.95s -> 18949.56s]  Give me the key.
[18955.45s -> 18956.57s]  I gotta put him behind the,
[18956.57s -> 18957.37s]  at least put him behind.
[18957.37s -> 18958.33s]  Stealth game, by the way.
[18958.33s -> 18958.73s]  I know.
[18958.73s -> 18960.25s]  It's, I am stealthing.
[18960.25s -> 18963.31s]  I'm, I'm in a fun house right now.
[18963.31s -> 18964.54s]  It's hard to stealth me.
[18964.54s -> 18966.06s]  You don't even know what room you're coming out from
[18966.06s -> 18966.78s]  or going into.
[18977.58s -> 18979.77s]  Okay.
[18979.77s -> 18983.15s]  Oh, more stuff.
[18984.03s -> 18987.16s]  Is this the big dining room?
[18987.16s -> 18987.88s]  Yep.
[18987.88s -> 18993.45s]  Remember, this is violent.
[18995.05s -> 18996.09s]  You fell off.
[19004.22s -> 19006.14s]  How long, how long do you think I could have
[19006.14s -> 19008.22s]  like an underbite for before somebody like,
[19008.22s -> 19009.42s]  that's new to the channel really,
[19009.42s -> 19010.38s]  like is like, what, what's this?
[19010.38s -> 19010.86s]  What are you doing?
[19011.50s -> 19020.70s]  I gotta go over this way.
[19024.52s -> 19025.16s]  What the fuck?
[19031.10s -> 19032.22s]  I need more potions, I think.
[19039.52s -> 19040.48s]  That hurts to do that.
[19043.53s -> 19044.41s]  He had a key too.
[19044.41s -> 19044.97s]  All right.
[19044.97s -> 19046.01s]  I didn't, I haven't been out here.
[19048.06s -> 19049.18s]  Marlin Brando.
[19061.74s -> 19063.26s]  Whoa, weird stuff over there.
[19063.26s -> 19072.19s]  That's pretty cool garden.
[19072.19s -> 19076.67s]  That's not a bad garden.
[19076.67s -> 19077.47s]  That's cool.
[19077.47s -> 19090.20s]  Night.
[19090.20s -> 19107.84s]  Magical tree stump.
[19107.84s -> 19115.13s]  Wait, this is, this is underneath the,
[19115.13s -> 19116.09s]  where, what is this?
[19116.09s -> 19118.19s]  This is really weird.
[19118.19s -> 19121.39s]  Can I climb up here?
[19121.39s -> 19122.59s]  There's a door up here.
[19122.59s -> 19124.76s]  Wait, rope arrow.
[19124.76s -> 19132.41s]  What's the point of this being in the game?
[19132.41s -> 19140.73s]  It only works on wood.
[19141.53s -> 19145.13s]  I, what, wood, apparently it only works on wood.
[19145.13s -> 19154.27s]  We're going to like Jurassic Park now.
[19154.27s -> 19162.11s]  Okay.
[19162.11s -> 19163.79s]  Time to go visit the Keebler Elves.
[19163.79s -> 19165.48s]  This is so strange.
[19165.48s -> 19168.00s]  What is this all doing here?
[19168.00s -> 19184.08s]  Yeah, this is crazy.
[19184.08s -> 19185.36s]  Oh, there's your wood.
[19185.36s -> 19185.92s]  Yeah.
[19185.92s -> 19189.04s]  Can I go up?
[19189.04s -> 19192.84s]  You can't, I can't even shoot up.
[19192.84s -> 19193.64s]  I can't go up.
[19193.64s -> 19197.29s]  There's nothing to even do this for.
[19197.29s -> 19207.13s]  What is going on?
[19207.13s -> 19217.12s]  Wasn't I just in somebody's mansion?
[19217.12s -> 19229.42s]  Walls or trees?
[19234.88s -> 19244.70s]  Wait, I can go down here.
[19244.70s -> 19248.76s]  I was already here.
[19248.76s -> 19251.20s]  Uh, a swim?
[19251.20s -> 19258.86s]  I wonder if this takes me somewhere.
[19258.86s -> 19263.95s]  Please take the next left you see.
[19263.95s -> 19265.07s]  I'm not joking.
[19265.07s -> 19277.07s]  This is left.
[19277.07s -> 19284.22s]  All right, I took the left.
[19284.22s -> 19286.56s]  Garden?
[19286.56s -> 19290.28s]  Um, wait a minute.
[19290.28s -> 19291.64s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[19291.64s -> 19293.16s]  Wait a minute.
[19293.16s -> 19302.06s]  I haven't saved it in a long time.
[19302.06s -> 19305.00s]  You won't come in the water.
[19305.00s -> 19324.56s]  We're safe.
[19324.56s -> 19333.82s]  What's he doing?
[19333.82s -> 19334.46s]  Get in the water.
[19334.46s -> 19356.43s]  Get back in the water.
[19356.43s -> 19358.35s]  Did I make it through this garden?
[19358.35s -> 19359.63s]  Is this a new area that I haven't?
[19359.63s -> 19363.23s]  No, I've been here before.
[19363.23s -> 19365.31s]  Guys, I have no idea what's going on right now.
[19365.31s -> 19375.82s]  Back on the second floor.
[19375.82s -> 19384.64s]  Let's open this one.
[19384.64s -> 19386.00s]  You gotta follow the music.
[19386.00s -> 19392.01s]  Thanks for staying up late, by the way.
[19392.01s -> 19394.78s]  I know we're at about 930 Pacific,
[19394.78s -> 19396.94s]  which means we're past midnight Eastern,
[19396.94s -> 19397.74s]  so thanks for staying up.
[19397.74s -> 19401.39s]  This looks important.
[19401.39s -> 19406.88s]  Nothing in here, though.
[19406.88s -> 19418.86s]  It's gonna be a trap room.
[19418.86s -> 19424.36s]  Crouch.
[19424.36s -> 19431.85s]  E and I already read this one.
[19431.85s -> 19436.33s]  Pastor, the one who trespassed your greenhouse
[19436.33s -> 19437.77s]  is chastised.
[19437.77s -> 19438.89s]  He did not know the rules,
[19438.89s -> 19441.45s]  but spies there no longer.
[19441.45s -> 19446.16s]  Trespassed your greenhouse?
[19446.16s -> 19449.52s]  Is that where I just was?
[19449.52s -> 19457.02s]  I think I was just there.
[19457.02s -> 19475.29s]  I didn't go this way.
[19475.29s -> 19475.85s]  Really?
[19475.85s -> 19490.56s]  Can I not open this?
[19490.56s -> 19491.20s]  Really?
[19491.28s -> 19506.44s]  Nice try.
[19506.44s -> 19507.24s]  Good try.
[19507.24s -> 19509.15s]  I will commend you for the effort.
[19509.15s -> 19517.44s]  All right, third floor.
[19517.44s -> 19520.43s]  No, still the second floor.
[19520.43s -> 19530.27s]  PB&J or grilled cheese?
[19531.77s -> 19532.89s]  I would say grilled cheese.
[19532.89s -> 19535.63s]  I gotta be in the mood for a PB&J,
[19535.63s -> 19539.02s]  but a grilled cheese I could eat at any moment,
[19539.02s -> 19540.46s]  of any day, of any time.
[19540.46s -> 19542.06s]  It could be two o'clock in the morning.
[19542.06s -> 19543.10s]  It could be eight o'clock in the morning.
[19543.10s -> 19544.22s]  I could have just woken up.
[19544.22s -> 19546.78s]  I could have just, you know, gone to sleep.
[19546.78s -> 19558.65s]  I think I'm where I'm supposed to be.
[19558.65s -> 19566.78s]  No, don't pull this shit on me right now.
[19566.78s -> 19569.44s]  I'm already kind of getting tired,
[19570.08s -> 19571.76s]  and this is one of those
[19571.76s -> 19573.68s]  everything's upside down things.
[19574.89s -> 19575.77s]  Oh, yeah.
[19575.77s -> 19580.38s]  Um, I'm going up.
[19580.38s -> 19582.84s]  Going up.
[19582.84s -> 19586.40s]  You eat grilled cheese and you sleep.
[19586.40s -> 19589.74s]  I mean, I don't.
[19589.74s -> 19591.42s]  I'm just, I'm just saying it's good.
[19591.42s -> 19594.27s]  Whenever.
[19594.27s -> 19595.39s]  You can enjoy a grilled cheese
[19595.39s -> 19600.64s]  at any moment of the day.
[19600.64s -> 19602.08s]  And what, I'm looking for the sword.
[19604.09s -> 19605.45s]  How do you guys even,
[19605.45s -> 19606.49s]  I feel bad for you guys.
[19606.49s -> 19607.05s]  I really do.
[19608.14s -> 19608.78s]  Honest to God.
[19610.57s -> 19611.69s]  How do you navigate all this?
[19612.25s -> 19613.45s]  You must have a headache all day.
[19623.37s -> 19624.17s]  Oh, my God.
[19631.13s -> 19632.89s]  I don't, I do.
[19632.89s -> 19633.37s]  I'm done.
[19635.16s -> 19635.80s]  I think I'm done.
[19636.86s -> 19638.38s]  This is really, this game is really fun.
[19638.38s -> 19639.26s]  I'm done.
[19639.26s -> 19643.71s]  What's your favorite type of cheese?
[19643.71s -> 19645.47s]  Uh, I like Swiss cheddar,
[19645.47s -> 19648.68s]  provolone, um,
[19648.68s -> 19650.84s]  Super Mario tubes.
[19650.84s -> 19652.12s]  Uh, what else do I like?
[19652.76s -> 19653.64s]  I like, um,
[19664.96s -> 19667.12s]  just give me the sacred baseball bat.
[19667.12s -> 19668.32s]  Whatever the fuck it is.
[19668.32s -> 19669.20s]  Get out of my way.
[19670.65s -> 19671.61s]  Get out of my way.
[19671.61s -> 19672.81s]  Give me the sacred sword.
[19672.81s -> 19673.61s]  Whatever it is.
[19673.61s -> 19674.41s]  Where is it?
[19674.41s -> 19677.71s]  Parmesan is, yeah, I love Parmesan.
[19677.71s -> 19679.07s]  Shea Parmesan is fantastic.
[19679.71s -> 19686.83s]  Did you hear that?
[19686.83s -> 19688.49s]  I thought it was like giggling.
[19688.49s -> 19690.25s]  It was like a giggling like gnome person.
[19722.19s -> 19723.39s]  You've got a bow too.
[19729.28s -> 19731.36s]  You are in my way.
[19731.36s -> 19733.69s]  Oh, my God.
[19733.69s -> 19734.81s]  Sacred sword.
[19734.81s -> 19741.72s]  Get me out.
[19741.72s -> 19742.04s]  Get me out.
[19742.04s -> 19742.44s]  Get me out.
[19742.44s -> 19742.68s]  Get me out.
[19742.68s -> 19742.92s]  Get me out.
[19742.92s -> 19743.32s]  Get me out.
[19743.32s -> 19743.88s]  How do I get out?
[19754.24s -> 19754.64s]  Shit.
[19767.88s -> 19779.07s]  Step on it.
[19779.07s -> 19780.70s]  The mines are worthless.
[19780.70s -> 19782.86s]  This is the most worthless item in the whole game.
[19782.86s -> 19783.66s]  Worthless item.
[19783.66s -> 19784.22s]  What's the worth?
[19784.22s -> 19785.34s]  I can't even say worthless.
[19785.34s -> 19787.10s]  I can't even say worthless item.
[19795.82s -> 19796.46s]  I hear somebody,
[19796.46s -> 19797.58s]  it's like somebody's screaming.
[19798.22s -> 19806.14s]  Do you hear this?
[19808.49s -> 19809.93s]  Step on this.
[19809.93s -> 19815.79s]  Somebody's going like,
[19815.79s -> 19816.67s]  get out.
[19816.67s -> 19818.03s]  Get out.
[19818.03s -> 19840.12s]  Don't get me out of here.
[19840.12s -> 19840.84s]  Somebody's laughing.
[19841.40s -> 19841.88s]  You heard it.
[19865.52s -> 19866.00s]  What?
[19866.00s -> 19866.88s]  That was like the...
[19866.88s -> 19867.68s]  That was like fucking...
[19867.68s -> 19869.20s]  This is Mario shit.
[19869.20s -> 19870.43s]  This is the Mario...
[19870.43s -> 19872.35s]  This is like Mario 64.
[19872.35s -> 19886.49s]  I leave.
[19886.49s -> 19900.75s]  I can't open this from this side.
[19900.75s -> 19902.89s]  Of course, I can't.
[19902.89s -> 19903.77s]  Get out of my way.
[19903.77s -> 19912.56s]  Oh, this way.
[19912.56s -> 19913.04s]  This way.
[19913.04s -> 19916.36s]  What was that?
[19916.36s -> 19950.33s]  Get me out.
[19950.33s -> 19954.78s]  Oh, shut up.
[19967.68s -> 19970.56s]  The music is getting scarier and scarier.
[19970.56s -> 19976.62s]  I'm trapped in this goddamn house.
[19976.62s -> 19980.25s]  I'm trapped in this house.
[19980.25s -> 19981.13s]  I'm stuck here.
[19981.13s -> 19987.74s]  This way.
[19987.74s -> 19989.56s]  And then I could go right.
[19989.56s -> 19991.16s]  Yep.
[19991.16s -> 19992.04s]  And then...
[19992.04s -> 19994.38s]  Here's the...
[19994.38s -> 19994.62s]  That...
[19994.62s -> 19995.74s]  This is the entrance.
[19995.74s -> 20007.24s]  This is the lady was laughing
[20007.24s -> 20008.84s]  and making all kinds of weird sounds.
[20008.84s -> 20011.63s]  That was terrifying.
[20011.63s -> 20013.16s]  That was fun level though.
[20013.16s -> 20028.04s]  That was a good one.
[20028.04s -> 20028.84s]  It gets worse?
[20041.53s -> 20042.41s]  Gets much worse?
[20048.73s -> 20054.91s]  Oh, God.
[20057.66s -> 20058.30s]  Hello, Jerma.
[20058.30s -> 20059.18s]  This is SpongeBob.
[20059.18s -> 20060.22s]  Do you have any questions for me?
[20064.22s -> 20064.72s]  Yes.
[20067.96s -> 20070.20s]  PBJ or grilled cheese, SpongeBob?
[20070.20s -> 20070.70s]  Which one?
[20083.02s -> 20083.52s]  Animated.
[20101.23s -> 20102.51s]  You were being tested.
[20102.51s -> 20103.55s]  Do you understand?
[20104.35s -> 20107.23s]  And I must say you more than live up to your reputation.
[20107.79s -> 20108.03s]  Wait.
[20108.03s -> 20111.39s]  You are quite an extraordinary thief testing me.
[20112.51s -> 20113.63s]  What is it you want from me?
[20113.63s -> 20115.15s]  Do you have Satan hooves?
[20115.15s -> 20116.78s]  I am a Tim Mr. Garret.
[20116.78s -> 20121.80s]  But there are some items that are not available for purchase.
[20121.80s -> 20124.44s]  They must be acquired using other means.
[20124.44s -> 20128.44s]  In this case, the item in question would be best acquired by thieving.
[20129.08s -> 20130.76s]  Not simple thieving.
[20130.76s -> 20134.65s]  No, just like yourself.
[20134.65s -> 20137.53s]  What exactly is this item?
[20137.53s -> 20138.65s]  It is the gemstone.
[20138.65s -> 20140.89s]  He's got like goat hooves.
[20140.89s -> 20143.53s]  For its unusual appearance.
[20143.53s -> 20146.49s]  Yes, kept hidden in the sealed cathedral
[20146.49s -> 20149.45s]  deep inside the halls of the scum hammerites.
[20150.01s -> 20151.45s]  Oh, but forgive me.
[20151.45s -> 20155.21s]  You are possibly friendly with the order of the hammer.
[20155.21s -> 20158.73s]  No, fanatics make unreliable friends.
[20158.73s -> 20159.77s]  Excellent.
[20159.77s -> 20162.33s]  I am prepared to offer you quite a sum.
[20162.33s -> 20165.29s]  A hundred thousand upon receipt of the eye.
[20166.01s -> 20168.65s]  I don't see how I can refuse such an offer.
[20168.65s -> 20169.29s]  Marvelous.
[20170.25s -> 20172.49s]  Victoria can fill you in on all the particulars.
[20172.49s -> 20173.29s]  Is this the final mission?
[20173.29s -> 20176.41s]  And Mr. Garret, the sword, keep it.
[20176.41s -> 20177.53s]  You have earned it.
[20177.53s -> 20180.97s]  But also, I believe you'll find it useful in your quest.
[20182.41s -> 20183.21s]  No, okay.
[20184.17s -> 20188.99s]  There's a few more.
[20189.63s -> 20196.48s]  This is mission number six, right?
[20204.92s -> 20207.96s]  Come the time of peril did the grounded gape
[20208.52s -> 20212.12s]  and did the dead rest unquiet against us.
[20213.23s -> 20216.35s]  Our bands of iron and hammers of stone prevailed not.
[20217.07s -> 20219.74s]  And some did doubt the builder's plan.
[20220.46s -> 20224.57s]  But the seals held strong and the few did triumph.
[20226.94s -> 20229.26s]  And the doubters were in chat
[20229.26s -> 20230.78s]  thinking he wouldn't beat the last level.
[20230.78s -> 20231.34s]  But he did.
[20232.06s -> 20235.90s]  Laying into the minions' ride at Universal Studios.
[20238.43s -> 20239.23s]  Pretty lit.
[20240.35s -> 20240.91s]  I don't know.
[20240.91s -> 20241.47s]  I'm done.
[20241.47s -> 20242.51s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[20242.51s -> 20243.31s]  Not tomorrow.
[20243.31s -> 20243.79s]  What's the day?
[20243.79s -> 20244.35s]  What's the day?
[20246.09s -> 20246.73s]  What's the day?
[20254.97s -> 20255.53s]  Saturday, okay.
[20260.68s -> 20261.00s]  All right.
[20261.00s -> 20262.60s]  I've got a question for people in chat here.
[20271.08s -> 20272.52s]  I plan on streaming again on Wednesday.
[20275.39s -> 20278.88s]  I was gonna do VR soon.
[20279.68s -> 20281.36s]  I think I want to do one more game stream.
[20282.08s -> 20283.53s]  I want to do Everhood.
[20284.57s -> 20285.87s]  But I also kind of want to finish this.
[20291.79s -> 20296.48s]  How much more time is in this game?
[20297.04s -> 20298.08s]  Another couple hours maybe?
[20298.08s -> 20298.64s]  Two, three hours?
[20299.20s -> 20304.24s]  This is fun.
[20304.24s -> 20305.18s]  It's a little old.
[20305.18s -> 20305.82s]  It's a little crunchy.
[20305.82s -> 20306.70s]  But I'm having a good time.
[20307.26s -> 20313.36s]  So what I'll probably do is on Wednesday.
[20313.36s -> 20315.29s]  It's probably two.
[20317.02s -> 20318.22s]  There's like eight missions.
[20318.78s -> 20323.55s]  Thief 2 is better.
[20324.92s -> 20325.96s]  Oh, there's a lot more.
[20325.96s -> 20326.20s]  Okay.
[20326.76s -> 20330.09s]  This might take more than another stream.
[20330.09s -> 20330.41s]  All right.
[20332.38s -> 20333.90s]  Well, I'm down to play it again.
[20334.86s -> 20338.38s]  I know you just...
[20339.42s -> 20340.70s]  You got sucked into a wormhole.
[20341.76s -> 20343.04s]  Oh, yeah, I'll play.
[20343.84s -> 20345.04s]  Yakuza again.
[20345.04s -> 20347.28s]  I'll play Sam and Max again.
[20347.28s -> 20348.00s]  Season three.
[20348.00s -> 20349.36s]  Oh, yeah, I'll play.
[20350.08s -> 20351.36s]  No umbrellas allowed.
[20351.36s -> 20352.96s]  Oh, yeah, I'll finish.
[20353.68s -> 20356.00s]  I'll finish Hollow Knight.
[20356.00s -> 20356.96s]  Oh, I'll...
[20356.96s -> 20357.36s]  I know.
[20358.00s -> 20359.68s]  I'll do Monster Rancher 2.
[20359.68s -> 20360.16s]  I know.
[20360.16s -> 20360.56s]  Trust me.
[20360.56s -> 20361.04s]  I know.
[20361.04s -> 20373.79s]  Or Hollow Knight.
[20373.79s -> 20376.97s]  But no, I actually will probably...
[20376.97s -> 20377.85s]  I'll probably do this again.
[20377.85s -> 20380.00s]  Wednesday, I want to do Everhood.
[20380.00s -> 20383.56s]  But at this time, I also kind of want to maybe do this too.
[20383.56s -> 20385.08s]  And or I'll just do this.
[20385.08s -> 20387.00s]  Maybe I won't do VR yet.
[20387.00s -> 20389.08s]  Maybe I'll finish this or play some more.
[20389.08s -> 20390.20s]  If not, then this is really fun.
[20390.20s -> 20393.44s]  It's cool to play for a while.
[20393.44s -> 20396.30s]  Wednesday, Everhood's the plan.
[20396.30s -> 20397.90s]  But, you know, we'll see.
[20397.90s -> 20401.37s]  What about all of this part two?
[20401.37s -> 20402.81s]  No, all this part one was enough.
[20402.81s -> 20405.48s]  Let me save it though.
[20405.48s -> 20407.68s]  Yeah, let me just...
[20407.68s -> 20408.88s]  Let me get prepared.
[20408.88s -> 20412.08s]  This is the...
[20412.08s -> 20412.96s]  Seems like a big mission.
[20412.96s -> 20413.28s]  Constant...
[20413.28s -> 20414.88s]  Oh, I actually get the new sword too.
[20417.02s -> 20417.82s]  I'll take one of these.
[20418.54s -> 20421.58s]  Two of these.
[20422.14s -> 20424.08s]  And I'll take a few...
[20424.64s -> 20426.48s]  I'll take a few of these.
[20427.04s -> 20431.53s]  I think that's all I can afford.
[20437.32s -> 20439.42s]  Okay.
[20439.42s -> 20440.62s]  Very interesting.
[20440.62s -> 20441.34s]  Save the game.
[20441.34s -> 20442.14s]  Hard save.
[20442.14s -> 20443.02s]  Right here in the beginning.
[20443.02s -> 20443.50s]  Right at the top.
[20447.37s -> 20448.25s]  I think I'm going to call it here.
[20448.81s -> 20451.24s]  That was really fun.
[20451.98s -> 20453.58s]  If we see this again, then we see it again.
[20453.58s -> 20456.48s]  If not, then that was thief gold.
[20456.48s -> 20458.88s]  I would give that a stamp of thumbs up.
[20459.52s -> 20461.48s]  I had a good time.
[20462.12s -> 20463.84s]  Hope you did too.
[20464.40s -> 20467.69s]  Are you going to put the ring light around your neck?
[20467.69s -> 20469.95s]  If it's safe, I would do it.
[20469.95s -> 20473.12s]  I don't know.
[20473.12s -> 20480.32s]  I'll see you guys on Wednesday, around 4 o'clock Pacific.
[20480.32s -> 20482.96s]  And I know that we're starting late a lot recently.
[20484.46s -> 20487.37s]  My sleep schedule is kind of all over the place.
[20487.85s -> 20491.45s]  Once I correct it, and I can pull back my sleep schedule a little bit,
[20492.48s -> 20502.30s]  we'll try to start more around that 2-2.30 Pacific area.
[20502.30s -> 20502.86s]  Oh yeah.
[20502.86s -> 20504.78s]  That was thief.
[20504.78s -> 20506.86s]  I will see you guys on Wednesday.
[20506.86s -> 20512.91s]  As always, thanks for watching.
[20512.91s -> 20514.27s]  Go to the credits.
[20514.27s -> 20525.31s]  Yeah, another reason why I want to start earlier is because I know that 4 o'clock Pacific,
[20525.31s -> 20529.29s]  if I stream for more than 5 or 6 hours,
[20529.85s -> 20531.85s]  it starts to get really late for people.
[20531.85s -> 20537.95s]  And I don't want to keep everybody up crazy late.
[20539.08s -> 20544.24s]  You know, 9, 10 o'clock Pacific is 12, 1 a.m. Eastern,
[20544.24s -> 20546.40s]  which is just an ungodly hour EU.
[20550.46s -> 20555.77s]  I'd like to try to stay in that, at least most of North America.
[20555.77s -> 20559.37s]  Doesn't have to stay up too late.
[20559.37s -> 20561.77s]  I'm sorry, EU friendos.
[20561.77s -> 20565.88s]  I live in the Pacific time zone, and I stream in the afternoon.
[20565.88s -> 20566.68s]  I'm very sorry.
[20566.68s -> 20568.78s]  It's the way it is though.
[20568.78s -> 20574.11s]  We have a 15-hour difference.
[20575.31s -> 20576.43s]  That's ridiculous to me.
[20580.88s -> 20585.92s]  Yeah, we'll at least be doing Everhood.
[20585.92s -> 20588.27s]  Keep an eye out if we do something else.
[20588.27s -> 20591.53s]  And then I'm probably going to get back into VR.
[20591.53s -> 20596.33s]  Hitman VR comes out on the 20th, the second that releases.
[20596.33s -> 20596.89s]  We're going to play it.
[20596.89s -> 20597.93s]  We're going to play it on the 20th.
[20597.93s -> 20598.65s]  Hopefully it works.
[20598.65s -> 20600.89s]  Hopefully there's not server problems or something.
[20600.89s -> 20602.12s]  The olives?
[20602.12s -> 20603.72s]  I already did the olives in the beginning of the stream.
[20603.72s -> 20608.76s]  I mean, I attempted it.
[20608.76s -> 20610.92s]  I can't say it went that well, but I did.
[20610.92s -> 20616.20s]  I tried.
[20616.20s -> 20627.34s]  What is the big stream?
[20627.34s -> 20631.77s]  The big stream will probably be, I don't have a hard day for you,
[20631.77s -> 20635.05s]  but it's supposed to be somewhere in the end of January
[20635.05s -> 20637.53s]  into maybe the first or second week of February.
[20637.61s -> 20641.05s]  I don't have a date yet, but I will give it to you.
[20641.05s -> 20643.61s]  There's a lot of factors as to what that date is.
[20643.61s -> 20646.51s]  Oh, I missed the olives.
[20647.79s -> 20651.84s]  All right, let's raid.
[20653.60s -> 20655.20s]  Connor Eats Pants is live.
[20655.20s -> 20658.25s]  Connor has raided the stream a bunch of times.
[20658.25s -> 20660.11s]  He's a really swell dude.
[20660.11s -> 20662.51s]  He's been a huge supporter of the channel, as you know.
[20663.79s -> 20666.35s]  And I'm ending, and Connor's live.
[20666.35s -> 20672.80s]  So let's go say hi to Connor, say hello.
[20677.71s -> 20687.28s]  He's playing Pokemon Brilliant Diamond or whatever this is.
[20687.28s -> 20690.30s]  If I die in the game, I die in real life.
[20690.30s -> 20690.80s]  Okay.
[20694.59s -> 20697.16s]  Say hi to Connor, everybody.
[20697.16s -> 20698.28s]  Say hello to Connor.
[20699.00s -> 20700.70s]  Connor!
[20700.70s -> 20704.81s]  No, go say hi.
[20704.81s -> 20708.14s]  I will see you guys on Wednesday.
[20708.14s -> 20708.78s]  Good night.
[20708.78s -> 20709.34s]  Goodbye.
[20709.34s -> 20710.43s]  Take care of yourself.
[20710.43s -> 20711.15s]  Sleep well.
[20711.15s -> 20712.65s]  Have a good one.
[20756.56s -> 20759.76s]  He's literally at the very end of Pokemon Brilliant Diamond.
[20759.76s -> 20761.52s]  He's literally at the last cutscene of the game.
[20763.92s -> 20765.76s]  Just be aware of that, by the way, guys.
[20766.32s -> 20766.96s]  Be aware of that.
[20766.96s -> 20768.88s]  He's literally at the last cutscene, I think.
[20768.88s -> 20770.00s]  I have no idea.
[20770.00s -> 20770.64s]  That's what he just said.
[20771.36s -> 20773.23s]  All right, be careful.
[20773.23s -> 20774.43s]  I'll see you later.
