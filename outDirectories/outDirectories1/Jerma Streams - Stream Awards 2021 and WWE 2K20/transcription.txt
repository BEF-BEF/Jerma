[2.68s -> 8.95s]  Well hello there, happy new year to some of you. At least those of you in EU.
[8.95s -> 17.50s]  We're not celebrating yet. I'm not ready to celebrate yet. It's only 7.25 pacific time.
[17.50s -> 28.02s]  I've got time. We're not on my time yet. But hello. We are early. We're going to start soon
[28.02s -> 33.13s]  for about five minutes. I don't want to just go live and then out here I've got the best
[33.13s -> 41.35s]  new character. No, no, no. We're going to take our time. This is going to be a long one.
[41.51s -> 49.02s]  I'm going to tell you right now. Let's just go over a few things while we turn the stream on.
[49.58s -> 62.41s]  Are you drinking? I drink four times a year. Christmas, New Year's, and weddings. That's it.
[63.30s -> 70.12s]  I can live a little. Early what the fuck? We're pretty early but we're going to just sit here
[70.12s -> 78.78s]  for a few minutes. What I'm about to tell you is, just listen. There are 26 categories this year.
[79.50s -> 86.50s]  Last year I think there were 18. Now some of these categories are fucking stupid, right? Let's be
[86.50s -> 94.09s]  honest. Did Worse Peter really have to be on here this year? Yes. I don't care if I don't say it.
[94.09s -> 99.53s]  It's going to be on here every single year. But there's a lot of categories to go through.
[100.25s -> 107.56s]  And at the same time, there's a whole Germania wrestling event to go through too. There are
[107.56s -> 111.96s]  eight matches including the Rumble this year. And there are, I believe, at last count,
[113.00s -> 119.54s]  55 characters in this year's Rumble. Well, in this year's card. Because obviously you can't
[119.54s -> 124.52s]  have more than 30 people in a Rumble. It's going to get a little weird. It's going to be mayhem.
[125.78s -> 128.58s]  There are seven matches before the Rumble. We're going to be here all night.
[130.55s -> 134.55s]  That's why I started early so that at 7 30 when people trickle in, we can just fucking get out
[134.55s -> 145.34s]  of here and get started. But hope you're having a good day. Hope you're having a good New Year's
[145.34s -> 152.62s]  Eve. I got like all these characters. I got all these cards in front of me. I'm excited. I'm very
[152.62s -> 169.51s]  excited about this. 7 30. You know, do face cam? Of course I will. I'll be full cam for a huge portion
[169.51s -> 178.84s]  of the stream. You know what I mean? I'm all dressed up too. I dressed up for this. I don't
[178.84s -> 187.54s]  just have a suit jacket on. Do a little fedora. No, no, no. I dressed up today. I'll show you.
[187.54s -> 195.38s]  I'll stand up and I'll show you the whole outfit. You better be in an Among Us costume.
[196.02s -> 204.30s]  You look like shit. I ain't even on camera yet. So you can't even say that. We're getting a ton of
[204.30s -> 210.28s]  community subs. You don't have to be doing this. 25 community subs from ChebIsDead. Thanks for the
[210.28s -> 219.29s]  25 subs. And we have so many. We have five from Juice, five from Skippy, five from Pink, five from
[219.29s -> 226.41s]  Jenny, five from 8bit, 10 from Onymos. All right. Sorry. I'm not going to read these anymore.
[227.69s -> 230.97s]  No more. I'm not reading any more community subs. I'll just make that really clear.
[231.93s -> 237.85s]  Fourslash just gave 50. No more. I'm not reading any more community subs. You guys are spoiling me.
[237.85s -> 244.92s]  We're not even in the new year yet. Thank you so much, everybody, for the insane amount
[245.56s -> 248.92s]  of community subs. But I'm no longer going to read them. I'm making that clear,
[250.31s -> 258.38s]  clear as day. He hates his community. No, I love this community. I don't want to see this community
[258.38s -> 268.28s]  go broke. Are you up in fart already? I was thinking about just trying as hard as I could
[268.28s -> 277.24s]  right there. Are we going to watch The Croods? No, I didn't have a plan on watching The Croods
[277.24s -> 286.49s]  today on stream. Why would I watch The Croods? Thanks a lot, everybody. It's unnecessary. You
[286.49s -> 294.01s]  guys are too good to me. Why not? I'm not going to watch The Croods. I don't even want to watch
[294.01s -> 299.66s]  that movie in my off time, let alone on the stream. That's not to say the movie's bad. I
[299.66s -> 313.99s]  just don't. I don't want to watch The Croods. Somebody typed the exact same thing as me. Is
[313.99s -> 321.03s]  that what somebody said? What did you type? I'm actually kind of curious. Are you sure it's not
[321.03s -> 328.70s]  just you on a second account? What about The Croods, too? No, I'm not going to watch either
[328.70s -> 338.52s]  one of those movies. All right. Are you ready? It's 730. I think it's time to begin the festivities.
[339.08s -> 345.93s]  What do you think? I did my hair. Or at least I tried to. Are we ready to begin the festivities?
[348.04s -> 355.80s]  No, hold on. Get a drink. Go get a drink. Go, go, go, go. Hurry up. I'm giving you one minute.
[361.29s -> 372.06s]  One minute. You're down to about 40 seconds, man. You got to pee. Go, go, go. Stop. Oh, stop doing
[372.06s -> 378.55s]  this. That's too much. That's too many community subs. That's way too many. That's enough. No more.
[378.55s -> 387.22s]  No more community subs ever again. After that one. That's a hundred from Repetio. That's enough.
[387.22s -> 393.30s]  That's enough. All right. I'm putting my fork down and I'm putting my knife down at the table.
[393.30s -> 402.70s]  All right. That's enough. You guys ready? Back from the bathroom? That's a shitload of money.
[402.70s -> 410.36s]  Thank you. I don't. Don't stop doing this. Stop doing this. Stop doing it. I demand it. OK,
[410.36s -> 415.96s]  here we go. I know how to stop this. I've got to get on camera so people can talk about how
[415.96s -> 428.06s]  well I did my hair today. So let's go ahead and do it. Here we go. Hey, look at me. All right.
[428.06s -> 436.02s]  Told you I dressed up. Told you I... Did I fly up? OK, it is. I got... I have like suit pants on,
[436.02s -> 445.80s]  guys. I'm not messing around. I got my bands. I'm ready. I'm ready for the new year. You look like
[445.80s -> 450.10s]  you're going through a job interview. I don't think you would wear these at a job interview.
[450.10s -> 461.48s]  That'd be a little weird, I think. I don't know if these would be on. Blue man... Yeah, it's
[461.48s -> 466.84s]  New Year's. It isn't New Year's. Don't you do blue stuff on New Year's? Or kind of? And guess what I
[466.84s -> 495.38s]  got? I'll give you a hint. It's a ring light! OK, that's so much. All right, let me explain.
[495.38s -> 501.03s]  The reason... All right, first of all, this says finally 21 on it. I don't know if you can see that.
[501.03s -> 511.46s]  It's 2022. I think that was on clearance somewhere. I'm over 21. But the cup is big enough
[511.46s -> 518.78s]  to fit a whole bottle of champagne. I don't want to be moving around. I don't want to go like
[518.78s -> 522.78s]  up and down and throw it into the refrigerator. No, I'm just... It's right here. I don't need to
[522.78s -> 526.38s]  refill it. Why would I need to refill it? I'm not going to chug it. You're going to make me puke.
[527.10s -> 532.82s]  I needed a glass that could fit the entire bottle of champagne, just in case I needed it. And it's
[532.82s -> 540.23s]  right here in case I need it. You like the decorations? Look, can you see? You see the
[540.23s -> 549.11s]  glow sticks on the ground? Spill joke? No, I cannot fuck around. This is prop comedy. This is... I'm
[549.11s -> 555.70s]  telling you right now, this is not... This is not prop comedy. I actually wanted this to hold this
[555.70s -> 560.26s]  much. And I know you're only supposed to do like that much, but I don't give a shit. I'm not a prop
[560.26s -> 568.17s]  comedian. If this spills, I'm going to have to like hire a professional cleaner to clean this whole
[568.17s -> 572.79s]  room. A professional cleaning company is going to have to come in because this is a whole bottle
[572.79s -> 581.82s]  of champagne. All right, I am excited. Are you guys excited to find out some of the things that
[581.82s -> 591.37s]  we've voted on for the last five or six days? I am up right now. I'm very excited. Where's Otto?
[591.37s -> 595.77s]  Otto is in the other room and he's lying down and he's very happy. I didn't want to move him.
[595.77s -> 599.26s]  He's in his Sunday best. You want me to stand up? Should I give you the whole thing?
[599.26s -> 617.18s]  I'll give you the whole thing. I'll give you the whole thing. You, hey, you, yeah. I know you.
[617.18s -> 640.34s]  All right. Messing up. He looks like a youth pastor. Let me tell you about the dangers of alcohol,
[640.34s -> 650.90s]  boys and girls. This is just grape juice. This is grape juice. I've had this shirt since I was
[650.90s -> 656.41s]  like fucking 19 and it still fits. That should be a good thing to all of you. I should be able
[656.41s -> 662.10s]  to flex that. I've had this shirt since I was like 20. Wow. Do I still have that body? You know what
[662.10s -> 666.50s]  I'm saying? Even though this is a little big and I got like a pregnant stomach, if I suck that in,
[667.14s -> 676.15s]  well, I'm not going to spill it. All right. First. All right. Listen to me. We've got a lot to do.
[676.15s -> 680.23s]  I can't stall anymore. If you're here, you're here. If you're not, you're not. Welcome to the
[680.23s -> 686.57s]  stream, everybody. A legendary spill joke in the making. Don't even fuck around like an idiot.
[687.69s -> 690.57s]  We have, we're going to start now. We're going to start, we're going to do like three or four
[690.57s -> 695.94s]  categories. Then we're going to move on to do a couple of matches. And then we're going to kind
[695.94s -> 701.29s]  of go back, bounce back and forth. So the first category we're going to do, this is a good one.
[701.29s -> 704.89s]  There's so many categories we got to go now. Otherwise I'll be here till four in the morning,
[704.89s -> 714.66s]  Pacific time. What time is it? Bingo. Our first category is best new character.
[714.66s -> 720.76s]  We've seen a lot of new characters this year considering some of the larger streams that
[720.76s -> 726.57s]  you've seen on this channel. And we can just go ahead and get started. Ladies and gentlemen,
[726.57s -> 741.64s]  here are the nominees for best new character. And I'm joined by Josh from ScienceCenterNevada.org.
[742.36s -> 748.68s]  Josh, good to see you. So, um, I guess as a archeologist, you could probably give us a-
[748.68s -> 752.36s]  Well, wait, wait, wait. This isn't archeology. It's not?
[752.36s -> 755.24s]  No, we're, we're dealing with rocks. Oh, okay.
[755.24s -> 758.28s]  Archeology is people stuff. Rock stuff, that's geology.
[758.84s -> 762.86s]  So this is, this is not archeology? Not at all.
[762.86s -> 766.22s]  Come on out. Catboy German.
[767.50s -> 788.28s]  Where, where am I? I need to wink into this. Ow, my head, my brain just hurt.
[790.25s -> 799.11s]  Hi. Hi. I, I'm assuming that you're, you must be the maid. I heard you ordered a sexy maid service.
[799.11s -> 803.86s]  Why don't you grab a piece of bread? I want you to eat. Well, I've been cleaning. I wouldn't dare
[803.86s -> 808.26s]  touch it with my hands. Right. But if you just, but just eat with wash your hands and then eat.
[811.10s -> 812.86s]  I'm not putting it in your mouth. Right. No.
[814.70s -> 819.34s]  The name's Amelia. It's Amelia. Amelia. Okay. Amelia. Thank you. I appreciate it.
[819.34s -> 823.74s]  But I need to come out of the shower now. That's a good one already. That's a good one.
[823.74s -> 829.26s]  It's like a little guy. Oh, I'm sorry. Ow, my face.
[830.06s -> 832.86s]  I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to. Don't do that again.
[833.58s -> 845.72s]  Okay. I won't. Oh, no. My God. Oh, my fucking God.
[845.72s -> 854.47s]  Huh? You want to do what? I don't know. I'm not going out there. What the fuck am I?
[854.47s -> 855.91s]  Hey there, you're in deep shit. Yeah.
[870.41s -> 875.21s]  How about Strong Henry? Strong Henry Flush. Just fucking break his neck.
[876.17s -> 884.57s]  Break his fucking neck. Just kill him. You got voted off. You're up. Goodbye. He's done.
[889.24s -> 894.54s]  What? What are you doing? What are you doing?
[898.62s -> 902.38s]  This is my no, no, no, no, no. Excuse me. This is my house. I'm like,
[902.38s -> 908.30s]  why am I hiding outside of my own house? I'm hiding. I need to eat out of that peanut
[908.30s -> 912.30s]  butter later. No, I'm not going to. I'm not eating out of that peanut butter.
[915.96s -> 919.40s]  All right. This is fucked up because I feel like this person is like their boogers just
[919.40s -> 923.64s]  go right into their mouth. That's fucked up. If this person's asleep on the train
[923.64s -> 927.00s]  and they have a runny nose, they're just pooling the runny nose directly into their mouth.
[927.00s -> 931.32s]  No, this doesn't look like. Oh, my God. This does not. Somebody said this looks like
[931.32s -> 938.20s]  Adam Driver. What are you talking about? How do you see Adam Driver? Adam Driver is like a handsome
[938.20s -> 944.33s]  dashing man. What are you talking about? Dude, that is zoom in on you. I know who had my vote.
[944.97s -> 950.65s]  I know who had my praying mantis baby decided to sit up here and stay here. Take a look.
[953.24s -> 962.66s]  Look at how look at how big our boy has gotten. He stuck around for the whole four months and then
[964.54s -> 996.90s]  one day he just wasn't there. Oops, we're live. Sorry about that. Oh, yeah. There were a lot of
[997.54s -> 1003.30s]  new characters. There's a lot of every his thing about every category had so many nominees.
[1003.30s -> 1010.58s]  We had to drop. I'll just tell you, I think there were 200 best and worst noise nominees.
[1010.58s -> 1018.63s]  How do you even narrow those down? Like it took it took a week straight of narrowing that down.
[1018.63s -> 1026.33s]  And there's still like 25 nominees. Anyways, the winner, ladies and gentlemen, of best new character.
[1026.33s -> 1041.99s]  Let me do that again. With 35% of the vote, ladies and gentlemen, the winner,
[1045.99s -> 1054.89s]  Catboy Jerma. Amelia came in at second at 18% and the shadow movers at 13%. This also was the
[1054.89s -> 1060.78s]  least skipped question. Almost everybody, almost everybody answered this. Catboy Jerma. Here you
[1060.78s -> 1065.98s]  go. I'll give it to you. Take a look. Best new character, Catboy Jerma. It was a landslide.
[1065.98s -> 1074.86s]  It was just an absolute landslide. Um, oh well. I like to see when they're close, you know? Oh,
[1074.86s -> 1085.29s]  well. I love Catboy Jerma. I voted, I voted for, I voted for Cromwell. All right, we're going to do
[1085.29s -> 1093.83s]  this one right now because this one's stupid. Cromwell was robbed. Ah, let's fucking go.
[1093.83s -> 1111.72s]  I don't even want to do this category. Uh, the next, we're going to go, let's just do it now.
[1111.72s -> 1120.84s]  The next category is best ooh ooh. And if you don't know what that is, that is the first boss
[1120.84s -> 1128.10s]  in the Simpsons arcade game. It's a noise that he makes and I just can't stop doing it. Uh, I just
[1128.10s -> 1135.05s]  can't stop making the sound. So instead of having this show up like 10 times in best and worst noise,
[1135.05s -> 1141.13s]  it was just removed and gave its own damn category. I've apparently done this so many times
[1141.13s -> 1148.15s]  that it had to have its own category. Let's just go. The nominees for best ooh, ah, you know,
[1148.23s -> 1148.87s]  just, here it is.
[1176.60s -> 1184.66s]  Here comes a rage stream. Watch out.
[1195.50s -> 1202.94s]  Can you please spell the sound? It's just ooh. Oh, just spell it.
[1204.18s -> 1216.70s]  Ooh. Oh, the category is best ooh. I, this is not, I didn't put that for a category.
[1217.26s -> 1228.38s]  So ladies and gentlemen, the winner. I thought like embarrassed me. I like turned red.
[1229.02s -> 1234.97s]  Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of best ooh, ah, you, ooh for this, uh, this year.
[1234.97s -> 1250.42s]  We probably won't be back, but we'll do it for 2021. Wait, that's cute. The winner is,
[1251.38s -> 1263.18s]  this is like a three-way tie. I don't even remember which ones these were for a three-way tie
[1263.18s -> 1269.26s]  pretty much between rage stream, which was the resident evil six one spelling explanation,
[1269.26s -> 1273.58s]  which is the one where I was explaining it during monster rancher. And then the real voice one were
[1273.58s -> 1284.57s]  just me saying it. Look at that. It was a 50 vote difference, 25, 25. It's cause it's all the same
[1284.57s -> 1295.94s]  sound. It's literal. Hold on. I want, where's real voice. I probably should have had a clip
[1295.94s -> 1304.22s]  for who won. Who cares? Okay. All right. We'll do one more. Then we're going to get to two more,
[1304.22s -> 1311.14s]  two more. We got a long way to go. How much was that skipped? No. All right. Coming up next,
[1311.14s -> 1317.02s]  we have rumble stuff. We have wrestling stuff to do too. So I'm this 26 fucking categories.
[1317.02s -> 1323.78s]  Best accident is coming up here. Uh, that includes spelling something. That includes
[1323.78s -> 1328.01s]  doing something I probably shouldn't have done on camera. There's been a lot of those over the
[1328.01s -> 1335.50s]  years. They were quite a few in 2021. So this is for what you have decided was the best accident
[1335.50s -> 1342.89s]  that has happened on this stream. And surprisingly, one of them didn't make it.
[1342.89s -> 1362.79s]  We'll find out which one best accident nominees are these juggles. Oh, how do you guys think about
[1362.79s -> 1366.63s]  that? What do you think? That was a good play. I know what you guys want. I know what you're
[1366.63s -> 1382.55s]  looking for. I drank two Gatorades before the stream. This context for the people that don't
[1382.55s -> 1387.99s]  know what that is. This context, I promise. Does anybody else feel a slight breeze?
[1406.22s -> 1413.58s]  They saw me having sex with death in my bed. And I just want to say that that's not me. That's not
[1413.58s -> 1418.30s]  me. That's not who I am. I don't have sex with like three different people and like lie to everybody
[1418.30s -> 1421.82s]  as of a week ago. It was three days ago, but that's not me. I'm not. That's not who I am.
[1423.58s -> 1444.70s]  I woohooed him. We can't say that word. That's foam. Time for a foam party. But again,
[1445.50s -> 1459.43s]  this sucked. It got in the eye again. How? How did that happen twice? Spray it in the tub,
[1459.43s -> 1465.51s]  in the tub, in the tub, inside. How did this happen twice? You know what it looks like? Have
[1465.51s -> 1472.94s]  you ever seen those, those optical illusions where it's like the huge guy is standing here
[1472.94s -> 1477.42s]  and there's like a tiny little person in the corner and it's just like, oh wow, oh my god,
[1477.42s -> 1482.07s]  this is, and they're in a room and the furniture looks all weird. Like it's because the room is
[1482.07s -> 1488.62s]  like 50 feet long and it's like slanted. That's what's going on here. Cause look at, no, I'm
[1488.62s -> 1496.87s]  normal person, but when I go back here, I don't know why. I don't understand. It looks so bizarre.
[1496.87s -> 1502.78s]  Whatever. People are very, very ignorant of dead ringer spies. They never check and they always
[1502.78s -> 1509.34s]  lose their ground. So I get that sniper. I get this scout, pull the dead ringer out. We turn around
[1509.34s -> 1520.30s]  and we try and do it again. God damn it. Get the cat, get the cat. Come on, keep going. Move.
[1520.86s -> 1524.62s]  You're almost there. You're almost out of the range. You're almost out. You're almost out. You're
[1524.62s -> 1529.10s]  almost out. You're almost out. Good, good, good, good. Oh, thank God. Thank God you made it.
[1529.58s -> 1537.90s]  What does this guy look like? There. All right. There you go. You got what you wanted. Everybody
[1537.90s -> 1544.70s]  that was here, you got the imposter is fucking stupid ass subspace that you got it. I did. I
[1544.70s -> 1548.78s]  just realized that's what I just did. There it is. You've been asking for that for like two hours
[1548.78s -> 1554.58s]  and I didn't, I just did it. God. See what I'm talking about? This guy just rolled that guy.
[1554.58s -> 1562.18s]  That guy just rolled that guy up in a burrito and ate his ass off. That guy just rolled that guy
[1562.50s -> 1570.20s]  See what I'm talking about? This guy just rolled that guy. That guy just rolled that guy up in a
[1570.20s -> 1578.57s]  burrito and ate his ass. Ate him. I ate him up. I swallowed him up. I swallowed him up. And I
[1578.57s -> 1599.29s]  killed him. There's so many of these. Holy shit. All right. So there's your accident nominees for
[1599.29s -> 1608.97s]  best accident. Look at these. Look at how cute these are. The winner for best accident 2021 is
[1611.05s -> 1616.01s]  I keep making it. I keep muting the fucking goddamn thing. Have I ever streamed before ever
[1616.01s -> 1630.02s]  in my life? It's been like 12 years. The winner. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The juggles zerk with
[1630.02s -> 1636.02s]  25% of the vote. It was just, all right, listen, but I'm not gonna, let me tell you who the,
[1636.58s -> 1643.42s]  let me, let me give some context. I made up this guy named juggles who streams like a streamer.
[1643.42s -> 1648.06s]  And what he does is he drinks like a bunch of Gatorades and just like goes on IRL just chatting
[1648.06s -> 1652.71s]  like we are now. And he fucking shakes his stomach and all like the liquid sounds pick
[1652.71s -> 1658.60s]  up on his microphone and people like donate money to him and shit. And it looked really,
[1658.60s -> 1662.70s]  really weird when I did that on camera without the bottom part. There's your context for all
[1662.70s -> 1667.64s]  the new viewers. There's a lot of people here. In second place, sex with death at 16%. And then
[1667.64s -> 1678.09s]  cat meteor, cat meteor at 14%. There are your top three. There they are. That one ran away with it
[1678.09s -> 1682.06s]  too. We're going to do one more and then we're going to move on to wrestling. I got a lot.
[1682.06s -> 1688.60s]  This one's best POG face. Instead of worst face, we added a category called best POG face.
[1688.60s -> 1694.76s]  Do I even need to run the video for this one? Honest to God, do I, I don't think I, do I even
[1694.76s -> 1699.35s]  need to, I don't think I have to run the video. I mean, I'm going to because like I, uh, uh,
[1699.35s -> 1703.75s]  Dazzle made a bunch of awesome videos for this. But I mean, like, I think it was like 60% of the
[1703.75s -> 1709.77s]  vote won this. You all know what it is. But just let's watch it. Best POG face of 2021 incoming,
[1709.77s -> 1747.38s]  hear it out. That one was pretty good too. I will say too much and I just put a kink in my neck.
[1748.26s -> 1757.91s]  Oh, dude, the thing that everybody onion, onion ring. I got an onion ring.
[1765.56s -> 1786.57s]  Where are my manners? Sonic meat knuckles. Please welcome the chief creative officer
[1786.57s -> 1807.11s]  from Epic games. Donald. What happened? Right. Okay. Okay. Drum roll, please.
[1808.71s -> 1817.43s]  This is fucking crazy. Hey, the winner. This is the, by the way, this is the most,
[1818.65s -> 1823.29s]  this is the most ever that something has ever won in the four years annually. We've been doing
[1823.29s -> 1828.17s]  this for, oh, you couldn't hear it. I, I, I took the audio off. Sorry. It was muted. I was doing
[1828.17s -> 1845.78s]  the drum roll. Fuck. What the fuck, man. Maybe look like an idiot. Okay. With 58% of the vote.
[1845.78s -> 1856.87s]  That's the highest we've ever seen was the onion ring, the onion ring. Slime rancher two reaction
[1856.87s -> 1866.28s]  was 9% and then treasure map was 8%. This is also one of the least skipped questions. 58% of the
[1866.28s -> 1872.63s]  vote. That's almost everybody. And there were like 20 plus thousand responses or something,
[1872.63s -> 1879.90s]  at least 18,000 responses. So that's ridiculous. I can't believe that. That's actually crazy.
[1879.90s -> 1884.54s]  All right. Now we're going to do, we're going to take a small little interlude away from
[1884.54s -> 1891.64s]  the categories. We got through four. We got a long way to go. We're going to start the
[1891.64s -> 1896.70s]  Germany event. We're going to do two matches. Then we're going to come back and we're going
[1896.70s -> 1902.38s]  to do worst face when we come back. So I'm ready to go. Now everybody, I need everyone's collective
[1902.38s -> 1908.57s]  energy here. Please. Everyone put your hands together and pray. All of you. That this does
[1908.57s -> 1914.60s]  not crash. Everybody, we need all of our energy. There's 30,000 people here. I need collective
[1914.60s -> 1920.10s]  energy that the game won't crash. Because holy shit, there's like 60 characters inside of this
[1920.10s -> 1925.54s]  universe mode right now. And it's really having a, it's, it's struggling a lot. Please pray.
[1925.54s -> 1937.05s]  Please pray. I'm going to move this over here. We are about to start. Just give me one second.
[1937.05s -> 1950.01s]  Everybody pray. Please pray. Are we praying? Our first matchup is going to be a tag team match.
[1950.01s -> 1956.50s]  Can you hear it? Let's hope you can. I think you can. It's going to be a tag team match.
[1956.50s -> 1963.72s]  You'll see who the entrants are. Let me, everybody pray. You praying?
[1963.72s -> 1977.32s]  Germania 2021 can help again. There's so many characters this year too. Here we go. It's
[1977.32s -> 1986.20s]  loading. It's loading. It's loading. I think we're good. Yes, we are good. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1986.20s -> 1993.93s]  welcome to Germania 2021. My name is Germa985. How are you? Welcome to the show.
[1994.49s -> 2000.09s]  We got quite a big one for you here. Eight matches, including the rumble.
[2001.59s -> 2010.57s]  Our first match. What the hell is that? Why was it so huge? And why is the Statue of Liberty here?
[2010.57s -> 2019.58s]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I just saved the whole stream. I just saved the entire fucking stream.
[2019.58s -> 2024.14s]  It just leaked everything. Everything is on the screen right now. Every match,
[2024.14s -> 2035.56s]  every participant. I just saved the whole stream. Thank God. Here we go. I can't show the screen
[2035.56s -> 2040.01s]  because there's a leak. Holy shit. I'm so glad I did that. That would have been a disaster.
[2044.02s -> 2051.99s]  Huge thanks. I got to get, wow, this is loading. Tag team match 2v2. I would call this one a scary,
[2051.99s -> 2058.28s]  scary match. One would call this one a horrifying match. Horrifying.
[2059.45s -> 2066.50s]  Uh, Opster. I got, here we go. Let's, let's shout everybody out. Opster, Leather Jacket, Kroski,
[2067.30s -> 2073.67s]  VR Josh. Huge shout out to you guys. Uh, this doesn't happen without them because they made
[2073.67s -> 2078.22s]  literally fucking everybody. Like I didn't think I was going to be able to get to do a rumble this
[2078.22s -> 2082.47s]  year because I've been so busy with all this other shit. Everybody seriously like, okay,
[2082.47s -> 2086.15s]  here we go. Here we go. Huge thanks to those guys. This is literally, this does not happen
[2086.15s -> 2103.30s]  unless they do it. So huge thanks. Are you ready? Let's go. Coming up first,
[2104.42s -> 2109.30s]  we have, uh, Chris Redfield in his, uh, I think that's, uh,
[2113.19s -> 2135.80s]  in his official, uh, star's uniform. Chris Redfield. Chris R. Chris R. Chris Redfield.
[2135.80s -> 2140.52s]  Those of you that know, uh, one of the most classic meme videos I think I've ever seen.
[2140.52s -> 2145.85s]  Now who is Chris Redfield's partner? You're probably asking. You're probably wondering.
[2146.41s -> 2153.62s]  Well, that's easy. Was a big fan of Resident Evil 8. Thought it was a potentially game of the year.
[2154.26s -> 2164.50s]  Got the Grotto Beast chairs, which is really cool. His partner, Lady Dimitrescu. Lady Dimitrescu.
[2174.46s -> 2181.06s]  Lady Destro- I think I spelled the name wrong too, by the way. I can't even see the chat now.
[2181.06s -> 2185.70s]  Shit. My computer crashed. Am I still live? I hope so. I'm going to open up on my phone. I
[2185.70s -> 2200.42s]  can see chat on the phone. Yeah. I can see chat on the phone. Oh, hell yeah. Perfect. Yep. I can
[2200.42s -> 2209.64s]  see chat right here. Perfect. I think, uh, I think Lady Dimitrescu is as big as you can possibly make
[2209.64s -> 2216.79s]  a wrestler. I think she's like eight feet tall. I have no idea. It's going to be insane. So who
[2216.79s -> 2221.19s]  are they fighting against? You're probably wondering. Well, a couple of fan favorites,
[2221.19s -> 2225.74s]  I think. One in particular is a very large fan favorite. You're not even live. I'm live.
[2227.77s -> 2241.80s]  Jigsaw. I love how that takes up the whole screen. Jigsaw's 200 pounds. Jigsaw and someone else. And
[2241.80s -> 2257.22s]  can you guess who that someone else is? Who would be the perfect, terrifying, horrifying partner to
[2257.22s -> 2263.90s]  Jigsaw? I'm going to tell you, you're going to have to be careful here. I mean, a lot of us are
[2263.90s -> 2269.54s]  going to think this is really funny, but money is going to die. And there's nothing I can do about
[2269.54s -> 2287.96s]  that, unfortunately. Jigsaw's partner in the tag team match is none other than, then, then, then.
[2287.96s -> 2298.54s]  WWE 2K likes to do this thing where it loads the next thing. The horror. Don't look at it. Don't
[2298.54s -> 2310.49s]  look at it. Don't look at it. It's hilarious. I know, but turn off your screen for a few minutes.
[2310.49s -> 2317.38s]  So we've got Lady Demetrius and Banana Chris Redfield versus Jigsaw and the horror in the
[2317.38s -> 2328.94s]  first match. Just to get us started here. I don't think there's any extreme rules or anything. This
[2328.94s -> 2334.68s]  is just to get us going because there's too many characters. I am going to say we could probably
[2334.68s -> 2338.76s]  get predictions going too if we want on some of these matches. I would start it now if you could.
[2340.14s -> 2351.38s]  Horror. I am peeping hard. And here we go, ladies and gentlemen, the first match.
[2359.06s -> 2370.18s]  I feel the power. Chris Redfield, Jigsaw, tag team match and begin. Welcome. So if you want to
[2370.18s -> 2376.18s]  look at everybody's stats, everybody is pretty much in the same stat category. Some people are
[2376.18s -> 2380.39s]  stronger than others, obviously, because they are stronger than others. Jigsaw's starting to get
[2380.39s -> 2385.83s]  off with it. Chris Redfield is barely even doing it. Going to tag out already. Peeping the horror
[2385.83s -> 2391.99s]  at the very first 5 to 10 seconds. Not confident. Oh, the horror with a horrific kick to the stomach
[2393.42s -> 2397.02s]  as he pummels into Chris Redfield's midsection, going down to a knee.
[2398.76s -> 2403.32s]  Now, the tag rules apply here. You cannot come into the ring unless you're tagged in.
[2403.96s -> 2412.94s]  Otherwise, you're disqualified. I need to start making referees. Big bear hug here by the horror
[2413.50s -> 2424.90s]  on Chris Redfield. Did he just tap out? I hope not. With a thunder clap to the ears. Oh, my god,
[2424.90s -> 2428.10s]  the horror does not care at all. Going to go for the next snap. No, he's going to go for the ear,
[2428.10s -> 2434.89s]  right ear scrunch. Maybe a power bomb. No, spinning neck breaker from the horror.
[2435.83s -> 2439.83s]  Lady Demetrious goes for the tag. Here we go. Now, this is an even match. We've got Lady Demetrious.
[2439.83s -> 2449.37s]  Oh, no. Caught it. Both enormous wrestlers. Lady Demetrious, I think, is the highest you
[2449.37s -> 2454.34s]  can possibly make a wrestler. A horror might be as well. Jigsaw going to come in and wants
[2454.34s -> 2461.00s]  to play a little game here. How do you even do a move to somebody this much bigger?
[2463.43s -> 2471.02s]  I guess like that. Chris Redfield's out on the outside. There are rules in this fight.
[2474.70s -> 2480.98s]  I love where the banana is on Chris Redfield. It's perfect. Jigsaw is really timid.
[2483.38s -> 2488.15s]  Honestly, I would do the same thing. Why would you ever fight when you have this demonic,
[2488.15s -> 2494.65s]  otherworldly, godlike character that can just go in? The two humans are letting the two demon
[2494.65s -> 2500.89s]  people fight, which is, I think, a great strategy. I'm going over to the ropes.
[2500.89s -> 2505.16s]  Going to go to the top rope. Did she get it? She got it. Chris Redfield in the ring now.
[2505.16s -> 2518.33s]  Horror up on the turnbuckle. I'm an idiot. Why would you do that? Knee to the face.
[2519.74s -> 2529.05s]  He's throwing. I know. What the hell? Big right hand by Chris Redfield. Caught it. We got momentum
[2529.05s -> 2535.42s]  here from Banana Chris Redfield. Setting him up to a seated position. Going to go for the...
[2535.42s -> 2540.14s]  Going to go for the... I don't even know what this is. I don't even want to say what I think
[2540.14s -> 2547.77s]  it is. I don't know. He was like squishing his head. He's going to do it again? No, he's going
[2547.77s -> 2555.21s]  for that CQC that he learned at the Starz training facility. No, no. He's bumping into
[2555.21s -> 2566.68s]  and attacking Lady Dimitrisu. Horror is in a bad place right now. Lady Dimitrisu's got him in a
[2566.68s -> 2576.58s]  crab. Will we see a tap out from the horror? I hope not. Oh, it's going to be close. No, big
[2576.58s -> 2590.84s]  reversal by the horror. Momentum shift incoming possibly here. Oh, he's grabbing it by the face.
[2592.44s -> 2596.28s]  She's peeping. She's peeping the horror right now. That's all she can see. That's it.
[2597.74s -> 2608.50s]  No, wait a minute. Oh, big reversal. She's got him. Almost threw him over the top rope. What a
[2608.50s -> 2615.75s]  huge comeback. What an absolutely insane reversal. No way. Huge. Absolutely massive.
[2616.31s -> 2625.18s]  You don't peep the horror and live. Although a little bit of a reversal here. Chris Redfield
[2625.18s -> 2629.18s]  may be going to go for some kind of tomfoolery on the top ropes here. No, Jigsaw's coming in.
[2629.82s -> 2638.42s]  He just tagged him into pin. What are you doing, Jigsaw? What are you thinking?
[2641.45s -> 2659.56s]  Oh, we're going to see a breather here. No. Punching her in the stomach, but it did not
[2659.56s -> 2668.07s]  faze her at all. She is a demon. Jigsaw's just a guy in a suit and it's not even a guy. It's a
[2668.07s -> 2674.25s]  little toy thing. This match is going longer than I thought it was too. This is actually pretty
[2674.25s -> 2683.72s]  exciting. Big toss across the ring. I wonder if we're going to go see a finishing move here.
[2684.82s -> 2694.54s]  No, let's see. He's telling him to leave it alone, Ethan. Yep. I think he's getting ready to use.
[2694.54s -> 2700.90s]  You better leave it alone, Ethan. I think he's right here. He's going to go for it. Why does he
[2700.90s -> 2710.90s]  keep doing the same move? He just keeps kicking him in the chest. The horror is reaching so
[2710.90s -> 2719.21s]  desperately and it cannot reach even though he's huge. Oh, no. German suplex number one.
[2719.21s -> 2727.27s]  German suplex number two. German suplex number three. You're not getting up from that one.
[2731.03s -> 2739.42s]  Just destroyed. Oh, reversal. Got to get him out of there. Yeah. Jigsaw's got to get out or it's over.
[2745.78s -> 2753.35s]  No, he broke it away. I love how Chris Redfield just kicks people. He just puts them on the ground
[2753.35s -> 2758.20s]  and kicks them in the back of the head. No, no. Trying to go for that submission move.
[2758.84s -> 2765.51s]  Jigsaw is throwing right now. Jigsaw is pretty weak. This is really balanced right now because
[2765.51s -> 2768.47s]  Peep the Horror is really, really powerful. Going for the armbar. Is he going to get it?
[2770.52s -> 2780.44s]  No. Hold on for dear life, Jigsaw. Can you do it? Can you stay or is it over? No help from horror.
[2780.44s -> 2787.37s]  Peep the Horror doesn't even care. All the while, Demetrius is getting health increases as well.
[2787.37s -> 2790.97s]  Recovering lots of damage. Going for another one. Going for that. Going for another armbar.
[2791.69s -> 2796.55s]  That's all. The horror. Broke it up. Beautiful play by the horror. You can't let that happen.
[2797.27s -> 2800.95s]  He's a trained military professional. You can't let him do those moves.
[2800.95s -> 2813.08s]  It's over if you do. What is going on? That could be it. There's one. There's two.
[2813.88s -> 2823.70s]  Oh, that was close. Was that it? No, he didn't get it. He didn't do three. He only, what's going on?
[2823.70s -> 2830.58s]  He only did two. He did two and a half. Chris Redfield on the top rope. Okay. Okay, just pin
[2830.58s -> 2837.82s]  him. Pin him and let's get over, get it on with. Give me a fucking break. Yes. You know, there's a
[2837.82s -> 2844.01s]  match to win. There's a match to win and he's on the ground right now for you to pin. But apparently
[2844.01s -> 2848.95s]  you don't care about that. Chris Redfield just going for some taunting and that's going to be
[2848.95s -> 2853.19s]  the downfall. Could have had the victory right there. Jigsaw now doing the same terrible move
[2853.19s -> 2859.64s]  he did earlier, which is a series of really weak punches to the chest, which don't even hurt.
[2859.64s -> 2868.60s]  It's the equivalent of when a little kid throws like a magic wand at you and you pretend like it
[2868.60s -> 2882.41s]  hurt to make them laugh. Exact same scenario. What is going on here? Why are they going outside?
[2882.81s -> 2896.65s]  There's no count outs. Oh, there is count outs. What are you doing outside? He's just grabbing
[2896.65s -> 2911.45s]  his head. Submissions do not happen outside. Even if it works, he could hurt him. I think a count
[2911.45s -> 2920.38s]  out is 10, I believe. This is bad. Get back in the ring, Harv. What are you doing? Oh, this is
[2920.38s -> 2926.55s]  going to be it. That's it. That's it. He's going to get counted out. The referee's slowing the
[2926.55s -> 2933.19s]  countdown apparently. That was the longest eight I think I've ever seen in the entire time I played
[2933.19s -> 2940.87s]  these games. Why are you out here counting yourself out? Is this double elimination? Two?
[2942.39s -> 2960.17s]  What are you talking about? That was bullshit. That was so messed up. Why did he start the count
[2960.17s -> 2969.03s]  over? The horror is not in good shape. He thinks he's out of energy. Jigsaw does not even want to
[2969.03s -> 2976.25s]  put a hand out. This is a bad team situation here. He won't even put a hand out. Bad blood
[2976.25s -> 2980.33s]  forming here between horror and Jigsaw while Chris Redfield's got him in a power bomb.
[2981.13s -> 2991.24s]  That's bad. Quadruple power bomb. Unless Jigsaw does something about this, this is the end here.
[2992.95s -> 3003.38s]  That's it. One, two. Finally, Jigsaw decides to do something. He doesn't even care about anything
[3003.38s -> 3010.14s]  else in the whole match. Oh, that's it. That's it. He's got him. He's got him. He's got him.
[3010.14s -> 3015.16s]  There's no way the horror. That's it. Game over. Chris Redfield, ladies and gentlemen, got him
[3017.32s -> 3023.70s]  in the arm bar. I told you he was militarily trained. You got to watch out for that one.
[3023.70s -> 3027.38s]  I don't know what they were doing in the outside. It was stupid. Why would they not count?
[3028.50s -> 3039.62s]  That was really strange. There are your winners. Chris Redfield and Lady Demetrius. Sorry, sorry,
[3039.62s -> 3051.82s]  hold on. Demetrius. Weird that they did. Oh, they're getting booed. This is a huge boo.
[3054.95s -> 3060.55s]  All right. We're going to move on to the next match really quickly. We're going to do two
[3060.55s -> 3063.99s]  because there are eight matches, so we've got to get through these. We're going to move right
[3063.99s -> 3069.05s]  onto the next one. I don't want any spoilers, so we're going to go back to full cam here for
[3069.05s -> 3074.57s]  just a second. That was kind of an upset. I think a lot of people expected the horror to win that.
[3075.13s -> 3080.31s]  Let me go like this real quick. Hopefully, this doesn't crash. I hope not. Please,
[3080.31s -> 3083.43s]  God. I know I've seen a lot of boos. Yeah, a lot of you guys are not happy about that.
[3084.31s -> 3091.50s]  All right, next match. We're going to keep moving forward. This one's going to be wacky.
[3095.70s -> 3104.26s]  Uh, I get to see it. You don't. Here comes a payout. Yeah, if you bet on that, then yeah.
[3104.26s -> 3118.25s]  Why does he have a urinal in the side, in the corner of his room? It's like a fan, man. It
[3118.25s -> 3127.32s]  gets hot in here. It's Las Vegas. It's a fan. All right, the next one coming up is a four-way
[3127.32s -> 3135.77s]  extreme rules match. Anything goes, any weapon, any way to beat your opponent. I'm looking
[3135.77s -> 3140.15s]  forward to this one. This one's going to be fun. Here we go. Ladies and gentlemen, match two of
[3140.15s -> 3155.75s]  Drew Many at 2021 is incoming just as fast as this year went, it seems. Here we go.
[3155.75s -> 3166.28s]  Fatal four-way. Uh, this one is, uh, first contestant is Armin, Aaron Armlet.
[3173.56s -> 3180.94s]  So good. Uh, we have Armin from Attack on Titan. You might be able to guess what this fatal four-way
[3180.94s -> 3191.61s]  is, maybe after the next contestant. Uh, but yeah, we have Armin, Aaron Arlet as the first
[3191.61s -> 3202.58s]  contestant. I love this character so much. Somebody got it already. I'm surprised that you,
[3202.58s -> 3213.45s]  uh, could call it already. This is the battle of the sounds. We've already seen one of these
[3213.45s -> 3227.14s]  categories this year. No spoilers, but it's the battle of the sounds. The next contestant coming
[3227.14s -> 3251.69s]  up, Lala dog. Lala. That is their name. That is actually technically their name. Don't try this
[3251.69s -> 3259.08s]  at home. Please don't. You're going to get hurt. So we have Aaron, Lala, and who else could be in
[3259.08s -> 3272.09s]  this fatal four-way of the sound effects from 2021? That's the worst character. Yeah. I mean,
[3272.09s -> 3278.47s]  they're all pretty bad. They're all the worst character. I actually think they are. I think
[3278.47s -> 3286.39s]  they turned out great. Everybody in the whole, every rumble is, whoa, every rumble is worst
[3286.39s -> 3301.00s]  character. The hell was that? Who is the third contestant? Let's find out right now in our battle
[3301.00s -> 3311.46s]  of the sound effects. Lala is pissed at this entrance. Who is it? All the way from the
[3311.46s -> 3322.86s]  Simpsons, the Simpsons arcade game. This is actually their name. It's Warner Van Braun or something.
[3322.86s -> 3332.74s]  It's the oon or oon guy. It's the first boss of the Simpsons arcade game. Still one more person to
[3332.74s -> 3353.03s]  go. No, it's, are you, people are hooing Warner right now? Are you kidding me? We're getting a lot
[3353.03s -> 3358.60s]  of hoo mega lols right now. That, that's not, what are you talking about? This is where that,
[3358.60s -> 3369.19s]  this is the oon or oon guy. This is the guy that makes that noise. How dare you? Our final
[3369.19s -> 3374.17s]  contestant I think is going to really make people a little angry. Some of you are expecting somebody
[3374.17s -> 3388.20s]  else and that's not who you're getting. Who you are getting is oops. It's the wrong outfit.
[3389.48s -> 3393.40s]  It's the Tasmanian devil. It's the wrong outfit though. I put, I put the wrong outfit on.
[3394.38s -> 3397.91s]  Uh, they're, they are going to look a little different when they're in the ring,
[3397.91s -> 3411.21s]  but it's the Tasmanian devil. It's, no, I promise it's not the worst character. I screwed up.
[3411.21s -> 3421.78s]  I messed up and I'm, I, it won't be there. Make each sound? No. Welcome to Tasmanian devil. This
[3421.78s -> 3426.82s]  is the battle of the sound effects. Uh, the sound effects I probably did the most this year. Besides
[3426.82s -> 3435.43s]  doi doi doi, doi doi doi robbed. Well, that's too bad. Wait till 2022 is rumble. Uh, there are no
[3435.43s -> 3440.73s]  rules in this match. You can hurt each other as much as you want, which I mean, who really cares?
[3441.45s -> 3449.05s]  Hopefully somebody throws a fucking table at somebody's head. We have Armin, the la la dog.
[3451.34s -> 3460.86s]  And the Tasmanian devil. There we go. There it is. Hardcore match. Bring it on. Nothing
[3460.86s -> 3466.52s]  matters here. It's just a battle to the death. The first person I, is it, I don't think it's
[3466.52s -> 3472.58s]  elimination. I think it's just whoever pins wins. I'm not sure you can do predictions on this one
[3472.58s -> 3476.50s]  either. Oh, already outside the ring, la la dog. The two animals are fighting outside.
[3477.06s -> 3482.87s]  It's bizarre that the la la dog can handle the Tasmanian devil considering the la la dog is,
[3483.59s -> 3490.15s]  I'd say 150 pounds lighter than a Tasmanian devil. Maybe not. You're not going to end it already,
[3490.15s -> 3498.66s]  are you? No. La la dog, I would say was worst, most hated sound effect I did when I first did it.
[3499.22s -> 3504.82s]  And turned out to be everyone's fan favorite now. Uh, it gets requested. He's breaking Armin's neck.
[3506.97s -> 3511.93s]  I get requested to do la la more than any sound effect. And all you hated it when I first did it,
[3511.93s -> 3519.77s]  so. Sorry that, you know, you need to trust me. I thought he was going to punch the referee in
[3519.77s -> 3524.07s]  the face. And out goes Tasmanian devil to the outside of the ring. Now we're going to, ooh.
[3527.43s -> 3532.31s]  I'm sorry. If I get to, it's 2022 in like four hours. Let me have this for like another hour or
[3532.31s -> 3537.51s]  two. Just for like another hour. I promise I'll try not to ever do these sounds ever again.
[3537.51s -> 3540.87s]  This is my way to get it out of my system and never think about it again. So let me just get
[3540.87s -> 3552.12s]  over it. I'm hoping we see some weapons here. Maybe Armin might take out his, uh, his. God,
[3552.12s -> 3555.48s]  I've seen the anime and I know everything about it. I just don't know what they're called.
[3555.48s -> 3557.96s]  The stuff that they wear when they attach it to trees and they fly around.
[3558.52s -> 3563.00s]  There's an O. Oh, he's going for it. What's he going to get? He's got himself a stick.
[3563.56s -> 3567.88s]  And he missed completely. Missed completely again. Armin was never a fighter.
[3568.52s -> 3572.60s]  Armin was always, uh, the brains and the strategist. He was never the one that picked
[3572.60s -> 3582.97s]  up the sword. Two complete whiffs. We're paying a lot of attention to outside, but not the inside
[3582.97s -> 3590.89s]  and what's happening. They keep just throwing each other. Big pot. Holy shit. Oh my God.
[3592.09s -> 3595.85s]  He just threw him across the ring. Going under is actually, is ooh, ooh,
[3595.85s -> 3598.33s]  going to get something from under the ring. Is it going to be a bat?
[3599.13s -> 3603.37s]  Is it going to be a, what are you doing? You can't find what it's, what are you stupid?
[3604.17s -> 3608.62s]  There's like a hundred items under there. He's got a bat. He's got a bat.
[3608.62s -> 3620.02s]  Oh my God. Useless. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Ooh.
[3620.98s -> 3626.84s]  You gave him a neck massage for 15 seconds. Oh no. Don't let him win right now, please.
[3628.84s -> 3645.46s]  Armin's got the kendo stick. I think he hit him both. I don't know. Armin, you're supposed to,
[3645.46s -> 3653.26s]  come on Armin. You're not supposed to be aggressive like that. Two weapons in the
[3653.26s -> 3657.82s]  ring right now and ooh, ooh, ooh on the Lala dog. Now on top punching him in the face over and over
[3657.82s -> 3666.65s]  again. While the Tasmanian devil's in the corner and Aaron. Oh, big move by Aaron. Armin, whatever.
[3670.52s -> 3677.51s]  I think we're going to see potentially some weapon usage here. Oh, he missed. Big whiff
[3677.51s -> 3682.07s]  right there on the Tasmanian devil. Kicks him into the groin, I think. Big clothesline by Armin.
[3682.79s -> 3690.82s]  Oh, the dog has a weapon. No, doesn't want to use it. He tripped. I think he just tripped over it.
[3696.58s -> 3704.65s]  Reverse chin breaker there. Big DDT. Now you got to hit him in the head with the bat and then you
[3704.65s -> 3710.07s]  got to pin him. Everyone's so tired right now. But no, take him all the way across.
[3712.14s -> 3717.34s]  Go into the corner and nice move. All right, Tasmanian devil's got the bat now.
[3719.67s -> 3722.55s]  Lala going for the pin. Tasmanian devil not going to let that happen.
[3724.95s -> 3727.91s]  I think there are tables under the ring too. So I don't know what they're going to do.
[3730.10s -> 3736.52s]  Big scoop slam. I think this ladder is this tables. There's all kinds of crazy shit under
[3736.52s -> 3742.89s]  the ring. It looks like Lala might be going to get something. And that was way softer than I
[3742.89s -> 3747.93s]  thought it was going to be. And they make a table tower. I think they can do something like that.
[3750.01s -> 3755.45s]  Everybody is so tired. Ooh, ooh, ooh has a big advantage here. If he can get Tas on the ground,
[3755.45s -> 3765.62s]  I think this is it. This actually could be it. Now Armin's back up. Got the weapon again.
[3767.27s -> 3771.91s]  Oh, this is so dumb. Just keep the weapon with you. Carry it with you. Finally somebody just
[3771.91s -> 3783.75s]  hold on to it. Don't put it on the ground. Did he miss? Oh shit. Oh, he is just going rage mode on
[3783.75s -> 3794.58s]  Werner right now. That could be it. No, throw him out of the ring. He's got a bone to pick with him
[3794.58s -> 3799.83s]  right now for some reason. I don't know why. Armin now searching for something. He's got a
[3799.83s -> 3810.44s]  ladder. Ladder going into the ring. Where is Tas? Oh, outside. Okay. There it is. Ladder getting
[3810.44s -> 3815.54s]  set up. I wonder, Armin, could we could see some theatrics here? He's thinking about what he wants
[3815.54s -> 3819.78s]  to do. He might put it up and jump off out to the outside of the ring, which would be insane.
[3820.66s -> 3828.31s]  But it looks like he's stuck. His brain got frozen for a second. Those of you that want to know the
[3828.31s -> 3833.51s]  AI in these WWE games is about the intelligence level of a baby squirrel.
[3835.43s -> 3840.71s]  It's some of the worst. They're just so brain dead. Big. Oh my God. That was a huge move by the
[3840.71s -> 3852.78s]  Tasmanian devil. Break this up. Break it up. He almost just won it right there. Werner going
[3852.78s -> 3858.49s]  under the ring now. Oh, that's a steel chair. This is going to put somebody in the hospital.
[3858.49s -> 3871.74s]  He's going to put him in the hospital. Lala outside. Not getting up. Werner trying to find
[3871.74s -> 3874.78s]  his next target, his next victim. It's going to be the Tasmanian devil right in the head. Steel
[3874.78s -> 3881.85s]  chair shot right in the forehead. Now what? He's wedging the chair into the corner. This could get
[3881.85s -> 3893.16s]  ugly. No, he's going to fit him. No, not even close. Somebody's going to run into that chair
[3893.16s -> 3908.60s]  accidentally. I love when they use the weapons. It's so stupid. I don't know who's going to win
[3908.60s -> 3913.32s]  this. He's going for a sharpshooter. You got to break that up. This could be a tap out right now.
[3913.32s -> 3922.78s]  Break it up, Lala. Nice job. Sludge hammer. Armand's got a sludge hammer. Didn't know who
[3922.78s -> 3933.64s]  to use it on. What the fuck was that? What was that? Why did he just do that? What the hell was
[3933.64s -> 3944.34s]  that? He just screamed at him. And now he's got like streamers on his back. What is going on?
[3944.34s -> 3956.22s]  He's got caught. Oh, he's going full sick almost. Do falls count anywhere? I don't think they do.
[3956.86s -> 3963.83s]  I read that from chat, by the way, so don't be mad at me if you didn't think it was funny. I read
[3963.83s -> 3975.53s]  that from chat. Where's the chair? That's a good question. I think Lala's going to put it away here.
[3980.58s -> 3988.57s]  No, they're all so tired. If anybody goes for a pin, that's it. Armand's getting a little pumped
[3988.57s -> 3996.74s]  up here. I say go for the bat, hit him in the head, and then cover him. No, he's just choking
[3996.74s -> 4001.21s]  him with his boot on his tooth for stealing content. I didn't, what are you talking about?
[4001.21s -> 4012.41s]  I read that. I hope Armand loses. Well, you might see your opportunity right here.
[4013.37s -> 4031.94s]  Oh, everyone's back in the ring again. Cover him. Pin him. Cover him. This is it. Oh, no.
[4032.74s -> 4039.16s]  Not quite. He can't believe it either. He's so shocked. He can't believe it.
[4041.74s -> 4059.96s]  All right. Armand, get up. No. Is this it? How is this going to end? Weapon.
[4060.68s -> 4065.96s]  Cas stole, stole it from Armand, but watch out for the, I don't even know what to even say. They
[4065.96s -> 4071.96s]  all have weapons. That's all you need to know. Stop putting the weapons on the ground.
[4082.55s -> 4086.79s]  There are three weapons on the ground. Just pick one up. You don't have to steal it from the other
[4086.79s -> 4100.90s]  person. Big clothesline. I think that could be the end. It's not the end. Just pin him.
[4101.54s -> 4116.22s]  Stop being so stupid. What are you doing? Why would you walk away from that? Big reversal.
[4116.22s -> 4124.87s]  Hit him once and it's over. Double reversal. Triple reversal. Just hit him.
[4127.45s -> 4139.42s]  Pin him. Please pin him, Armand. Pin him, please. Please pin somebody. Pin someone.
[4143.62s -> 4155.29s]  Toss him out of the ring, for God's sake. That move doesn't even hurt. I've jumped into a hotel bed
[4155.93s -> 4159.77s]  harder than that. It doesn't hurt. There's nothing wrong with what you just did.
[4160.49s -> 4168.62s]  Chug him out. Chug him out. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. No.
[4169.58s -> 4182.92s]  Where's Armand? Oh, he's outside. Outside. These are spoilers for Attack on Titan.
[4186.02s -> 4189.70s]  I don't know what just happened, but that could be it. Too busy getting a weapon and he's going
[4189.70s -> 4198.10s]  to lose. That's it. That's definitely it. As he gets a table. No, that's it. Werner von Braun
[4198.10s -> 4202.34s]  from the Simpsons Arcade Game, ladies and gentlemen, is your sound of the whatever.
[4203.06s -> 4209.16s]  It's one of the sounds I've made last year. One of the many sounds I've made.
[4217.37s -> 4225.27s]  Very nice match. Congratulations to Werner. I get to do it one more time
[4226.34s -> 4228.34s]  and I won't do it ever again for the rest of the year. I promise.
[4236.42s -> 4241.06s]  I won't do that ever again. You'll never hear me make that sound ever again. One more. Wait,
[4241.06s -> 4250.60s]  one more. One more. One more. Okay. I'll never do it ever again. All right. Let's get back to
[4250.60s -> 4258.81s]  some categories. That was two matches. We still have six more to do, including the rumble.
[4258.81s -> 4264.58s]  We're going to go over here for now. I hope it does not crash. I'll be very sad if it does.
[4264.58s -> 4276.38s]  We're going to leave it. I'm going to be incredibly upset if it crashes. Cross your fingers and pray.
[4276.38s -> 4278.86s]  All right. We've got some categories. The next one we're going to do, we're going to go through.
[4278.86s -> 4284.54s]  This is worst face incoming. If you're new to the channel, worst face is usually a category that.
[4285.80s -> 4292.82s]  And when I'm in the corner, when I do my face cam, have you noticed that when I put face cam on,
[4292.82s -> 4298.74s]  every time I've had face cam, there's been a nominee for this. Anytime I put my face cam on,
[4298.74s -> 4306.52s]  people nominate a worst face that I've made. They range from excited to angry to like blowing
[4306.52s -> 4313.29s]  bubbles or something. I don't know, whatever it is. So these are your nominees for worst face
[4313.29s -> 4330.84s]  of the year. What does this guy look like? There. All right. There you go. You got what you wanted,
[4330.84s -> 4337.56s]  everybody that was here. You got the imposter is fucking stupid ass sus face that you got it.
[4337.56s -> 4339.16s]  I didn't, I just realized that's what I just did.
[4348.38s -> 4353.56s]  Somebody came in the room. The T-Rex walked in. It didn't matter what I was doing. I had to be
[4353.56s -> 4362.02s]  very still or I was dead. Or you don't have a place to put your cardboard cutout of German 985.
[4362.66s -> 4366.82s]  I guess it's going to go over here and lean against the wall while I clean the fucking room.
[4367.38s -> 4370.34s]  There's 50 subs. I missed 50 subs. Well, thank you.
[4370.34s -> 4384.41s]  You. Oh, that one was bad. It looks like somebody's like fucking threatening me to like,
[4384.41s -> 4391.72s]  like, yeah, you're not dense. Doesn't it look like somebody's going to fucking kill me off camera?
[4395.66s -> 4400.22s]  Oh, my funny bone. Oh, my funny bone. My funny bone. I just hit my funny bone and my arm is dumb.
[4409.21s -> 4417.90s]  Hainsaw sucks. What do we do? What do we do with him? You decide. What do we do with him?
[4417.90s -> 4424.97s]  What do we do with him? What do we do with him? I just went like cross-eyed.
[4424.97s -> 4430.97s]  What? What? What do we do with that guy? What do we do with him? What do we do with that guy?
[4431.86s -> 4444.63s]  Doesn't want me to do it. Just sit there. You have a huge inventory in this game. That's good.
[4445.27s -> 4461.27s]  It's like, oh, that guy is. Oh, wait a minute. I'm trying to get. I'm trying to get it.
[4468.20s -> 4472.36s]  Like, somebody snatched me. Somebody snatched me. I was in the middle and like,
[4472.36s -> 4475.40s]  before they took the photo, somebody like fucking snatched me and pulled me.
[4478.98s -> 4495.35s]  Some good ones this year. So the winner of the worst face of the year. I actually don't know.
[4495.35s -> 4500.54s]  I don't remember who won this. I don't know who won this. We're going to find out together.
[4510.17s -> 4516.89s]  It was close, but Eye Contact Whopper Bite was number one with 22%.
[4524.87s -> 4527.91s]  Eye Contact Whopper Bite with 22% of the vote.
[4528.86s -> 4536.25s]  Cartoon Anger and Accidental Susface are your winners. Hey, I made some deity very angry.
[4537.58s -> 4547.30s]  Eye Contact Whopper. 22% of the vote, which I can. I get it. I can understand. Nobody likes to watch
[4547.30s -> 4553.67s]  other people eat and nobody likes to have eye contact while somebody else eats. I don't. I can't.
[4554.92s -> 4562.49s]  I get it. I really do. I hate sitting across from somebody and we both have dinners in front of us
[4562.49s -> 4568.71s]  and we're both eating. I like, oh no, fucking get out of it. Let's go somewhere else.
[4568.71s -> 4572.82s]  I just want to just get takeout and sit on the couch. I don't fucking want to go to a
[4572.82s -> 4577.30s]  goddamn restaurant. The only time I like going to a restaurant seriously is if there's like
[4577.30s -> 4582.42s]  eight people and everyone's like, oh, did you try this? Try the lobster. Oh yeah. Did you get any
[4582.42s -> 4586.26s]  of that? Hey, you got to try this drink. And like you, you, you, it's everyone's just talking and
[4586.26s -> 4591.61s]  yelling at each other and shit. I like going to a restaurant with like six people. It was sweating.
[4592.17s -> 4603.27s]  Holy fucking moly. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. I got to get this off. Jesus Christ. What? What
[4603.27s -> 4613.46s]  happened? What happened? I got to get this off. I got to get this off. What happened? What happened?
[4613.46s -> 4618.17s]  What's going on recently? I've been sweating my ass off. Hold on. Let me turn on my urinal.
[4618.90s -> 4634.15s]  Let me turn the urinal on. I think I need it. Turn the urinal on. Jesus
[4639.40s -> 4646.82s]  God. Turn on your face. I just turned it on. Look, all right. I'm sitting. Look, let me explain.
[4646.82s -> 4651.96s]  I'm sitting down in a chair and I'm like, I'm sweating and shit. Like I got this ring light
[4651.96s -> 4655.80s]  now. I got this new ring light. I'm in like full lighting. This is not like a normal scenario. I'm
[4655.80s -> 4662.25s]  out at a dinner table with six people having fun. Anyways, there's your winner. But no, I like going
[4662.25s -> 4667.29s]  to a restaurant with like five or six people. You get to converse. You get to share. You get to talk.
[4667.37s -> 4673.69s]  You get to point at the person all the way at the end. Hey, oh, dude, did you try the chicken thighs?
[4673.69s -> 4678.41s]  And they go, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And you go, yeah, man, that's my guy over there in the corner.
[4678.41s -> 4685.26s]  I like that environment. I hate the other environment. I'm sweating, so who cares?
[4686.06s -> 4692.12s]  Going up next is best dancing. Sometimes I get on camera and I decide to move a little bit,
[4692.12s -> 4697.54s]  shake a little bit. What do you want about? Those that get it, get it. Those that don't,
[4697.54s -> 4706.30s]  they never will. So this is for the best dancing of the year. I don't know even how many times I've
[4706.30s -> 4711.10s]  danced this year total. We're about to find out. And no, I swear to God, I'm not a lizard person.
[4711.10s -> 4717.91s]  I just blinked weird for a second. All right, these are the nominees for best dancing of the year.
[4717.91s -> 4721.30s]  I actually forget what was nominated. Let's find out.
[4732.01s -> 4735.69s]  All right, there's a guy right now going like this, like way in the back.
[4736.41s -> 4747.58s]  There's a guy just like fucking freaking out over there. There's something, there's always like
[4747.58s -> 4750.38s]  bending down too. You know, like it's always just like, it's like,
[4753.35s -> 4756.79s]  it's like, and their hair is like going fucking crazy.
[4757.59s -> 4760.47s]  You didn't even let me choreograph this with me. I wasn't here at the rehearsal.
[4761.27s -> 4797.85s]  Oh, whatever. I'm tired. I'm done. Okay. I've trended on TikTok three different times in the
[4797.85s -> 4804.97s]  last fucking three years. Okay. Bring this one to the fucking front page. Oh, this one,
[4804.97s -> 4814.71s]  the goddamn orangutan. I'm sweaty as hell on this one too. Why am I sweating so much?
[4815.35s -> 4819.43s]  I swear to God, this is like a new thing for the last six months. Why am I so sweaty now?
[4819.43s -> 4828.87s]  I want them to see me Fortnite dancing before they die. Come on. They need to see this before
[4828.87s -> 4845.98s]  they go. Oh my God. That was epic. I'll give you the shake. It's the old fucking 36 year old shake.
[4846.78s -> 4861.94s]  The guy that paid $1,200 for a front row seat.
[4875.34s -> 4883.19s]  Okay. This is going to put the TV down for a second. Go have a good day. Go ahead. Take it.
[4883.19s -> 4886.39s]  I'm not paying. Fine. You can take it. I don't know if you've heard of that Tic-Tac or whatever.
[4886.39s -> 4890.95s]  Keep going. Don't talk to me. Don't talk to me. Fine. But I gotta do it. Are you tick talking?
[4891.59s -> 4894.71s]  Are you tick talking now? Uh, yeah, I think so. I don't know how it works.
[4895.59s -> 4905.27s]  It mills them in the back. It's so fucking late. Please. All right. All right. I'm the one in
[4905.27s -> 4914.71s]  handcuffs, bro. And he took us all by the hand. And then we started dancing.
[4915.75s -> 4919.19s]  And then we started dancing.
[4920.71s -> 4928.95s]  It's got the spirit. Remix. Remix. When God came down to the land in the land.
[4928.95s -> 4934.71s]  God came down to the land in the land. I can't believe what's happening right now.
[4934.71s -> 4937.19s]  I can't believe what's happening right now.
[4942.01s -> 4946.74s]  Somebody said something really, really important. And I have to address it because I'm going to
[4946.74s -> 4951.30s]  address these things. And yeah, I've taken it off a little bit. I don't want to see my sweat box.
[4952.71s -> 4958.31s]  Somebody said something really important. They said, I love how Derma's interpretation of dancing
[4958.31s -> 4969.99s]  is doing different poses. I mean, what even is dancing? Dancing is just doing different
[4970.07s -> 4975.67s]  poses in succession to make a new animation, like a new human animation. How is that? How's
[4975.67s -> 4985.43s]  it any different? That's what dancing is. It's doing different poses in a row to create a dance.
[4985.43s -> 4993.35s]  If I were to go like this, that's me doing different poses and animating with keyframes
[4993.35s -> 5005.19s]  in between. Anyways, the winner. That's not the right sound. The winner of the 2021 Best
[5005.19s -> 5018.09s]  Dancing Award goes to... What do you think? What do you think? Stop playing the fucking Among Us,
[5018.09s -> 5021.61s]  I'm the Impostor sound. Fuck out of here. I don't want to hear that ever again.
[5024.06s -> 5030.98s]  Breakdancing with 27% of the vote. And then in second place with 20% was the goddamn Orangatang,
[5030.98s -> 5040.81s]  the TikTok one. And then 12%, no rehearsal, no problem. So breakdancing during the dollhouse was
[5040.81s -> 5050.95s]  the winner. At 27% of the vote, a lot. Fair enough. I don't even want to do this one,
[5050.95s -> 5056.65s]  but we're going to do it. This is worse, Peter. There are a lot of people here watching and I
[5056.65s -> 5059.93s]  need to give context to this because I feel like you'd probably just think I was a fucking psycho
[5059.93s -> 5077.75s]  if I didn't. So pretty much, we're at the end game now, Peter. Game almost crashed. You have
[5077.75s -> 5082.90s]  to punish me for doing what I just did and saying what I just said. It's the mustache,
[5082.90s -> 5088.10s]  Peter. Peter, it's the mustache. You're probably also probably wondering if worse Peter's on there.
[5088.10s -> 5091.94s]  Of course it is. I don't think I said it once. I think that's the only time I said it the whole
[5091.94s -> 5098.94s]  year. This is on there. It has to be on there. I don't even care. Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[5098.94s -> 5102.54s]  Welcome to episode one of Dremacraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[5102.54s -> 5106.94s]  Peter, this is going to be a single player. Let's play. Oh, it turned into a different animal.
[5109.06s -> 5121.37s]  Oh, Peter. Keith, Mark, Zane, Evan. How could we have forgotten Peter? Please, to make your
[5121.37s -> 5128.49s]  acquaintance. I was a rancher here for years, but I can... Hey, hey, Peter. Sorry. You have
[5128.49s -> 5134.94s]  your own empire. Cool. Oh, this is cool. We're in the end game now, Peter. So I mean, this is like,
[5134.94s -> 5147.32s]  cool. I swear to fucking God, if I play that sound again, I'm going to freak out.
[5147.32s -> 5161.18s]  The award for worst Peter of the year goes to... Why would... Okay, I have a question.
[5162.38s -> 5171.24s]  Why was this such a huge percentage? I don't understand. Obama reads Dremacraft, Peter,
[5171.24s -> 5177.74s]  with 41% of the vote. They were all the same exact thing. All of them were the same. There was no
[5177.74s -> 5187.10s]  difference. Why was that so much higher than all the others? 41%? Did you all collectively
[5187.10s -> 5190.54s]  get in discord or something and say, oh, hey, by the way, we're all going to vote for the Obama
[5190.54s -> 5198.33s]  one? End game, Peter. And then, hey, Peter. Who knows what the fuck that one was? Who cares,
[5198.33s -> 5211.61s]  though? Does it matter? I think I just paper cut in my neck. Oh, the price we pay for fucking
[5211.61s -> 5222.46s]  showmanship. Coming up next, we have Otto. We have best Otto moment, which is every time that
[5222.46s -> 5228.04s]  the dog has been... I got a dog, Otto. He's a little wiener dog. I'm fine. Look, there's nothing. It's
[5228.04s -> 5237.02s]  fine. I'm fine. This is best Otto moment when my dog was on screen or maybe not. Maybe it's just
[5237.02s -> 5245.70s]  when Otto was mentioned or Otto was like some type of... It's in spirit, right? Here are the nominees
[5245.70s -> 5254.12s]  for best Otto. I can do that better. I can do that better. Here are the nominees for best Otto
[5254.12s -> 5286.38s]  moment. Oh, look at it. It's Otto. Let's take it. We'll go to Tokyo. Yeah, I want to do the mango.
[5287.83s -> 5294.26s]  Oh, nice, Otto. I want to sneeze. I'm not about to sneeze. I'm going to pet Mr. Otto.
[5299.32s -> 5306.30s]  You have a scratchy bum? Do you? Do you? Oh, my goodness. I got to get out of the way. He's
[5306.30s -> 5317.32s]  doing something cute. Hello, Mr. Toe. Hey, what are you doing over there? What are you doing over
[5317.32s -> 5341.40s]  there? What the fuck? Are you dead? Nope. Almost, though. Are you petting him? If you die right now.
[5341.40s -> 5354.55s]  I'm going to die. You understand? Bobbleheads? Oh, Otto. I can't believe there's an Otto. Oh,
[5354.55s -> 5366.89s]  I missed. Oh, it's a dachshund. Oh, it's Otto. It's little Otto. Where's Otto?
[5376.01s -> 5387.08s]  Who's a good boy? Otto. You guys want to see something funny? That bed was like $200.
[5387.08s -> 5397.16s]  That bed was like 30. Move out of the way for Otto. It's the same clip, except he's in the $200 bed.
[5397.72s -> 5406.28s]  That's my favorite part about that. He was in... Okay, whatever. Ladies and gentlemen, the winner
[5412.73s -> 5426.47s]  of Best Otto Moment goes to Orange Blanket Otto with 25% of the vote. Really? Wow. A pet Otto was
[5426.47s -> 5435.54s]  15%, which I would assume that would be higher. And then Otto sneezes off camera, 14%. Orange
[5435.54s -> 5441.77s]  Blanket with 25% of the vote. By the way, keep in mind, these have been rounded up. So Orange
[5441.77s -> 5451.46s]  Blanket probably got like 25.9% of the vote. So just for your viewership, you're able to see
[5451.46s -> 5456.74s]  and process because I needed to have round numbers. That just tried to kill me. This just
[5456.74s -> 5464.36s]  tried to wrap around my neck and kill me. Round numbers are easier for me, so hopefully they're
[5464.36s -> 5469.24s]  easier for you. All right, we'll do one more. We're going to get through this one right now.
[5471.00s -> 5475.48s]  This is the last, I think, of the shit categories. I think this is the last of the dumb shitty
[5475.48s -> 5482.98s]  categories. I have to warn some of the new viewers here. I know there's 36,000 fucking people here.
[5482.98s -> 5488.79s]  Listen to me. You're probably going to want to leave the stream after this. But stay. I promise
[5488.79s -> 5492.71s]  that this community is one of the funnest communities I've ever had the pleasure of being
[5492.71s -> 5497.35s]  part of. You're going to probably leave the stream during this because you're probably like,
[5497.35s -> 5500.79s]  I hate this sound. I don't like this. This guy sucks. I hate listening to this guy.
[5500.79s -> 5505.94s]  Why is he doing this? This is the best Aaron of the year. We just saw Armin play in the rumble.
[5506.87s -> 5516.20s]  I'm going to give you what exactly what I mean by this. So best Aaron is, okay, how do I explain
[5516.20s -> 5524.46s]  this? So in the Attack on Titan English dub, the actor that does Armin and Mikasa too, if you've
[5524.46s -> 5531.53s]  ever seen Attack on Titan, they're always yelling for Aaron. They're always yelling his name and
[5531.53s -> 5540.14s]  they're always doing it very loudly and very, you know what? Whatever. You understand. Thanks for
[5540.14s -> 5547.26s]  watching. TLDR. I just like, I don't know. It's stuck in my brain and I had to say it all the time.
[5547.26s -> 5563.13s]  I swear to God, I say this every day. That's a good, you're right. Freeze. Freeze. It's
[5563.13s -> 5570.90s]  midnight EST in like three minutes. Freeze. Nobody move. Oh my God. I need the thing.
[5570.90s -> 5579.03s]  Was it Lang Syne? Okay, I gotta get ready. I gotta get ready. It's in two minutes.
[5587.11s -> 5600.06s]  How? This is like guitar. What's it called? Old Lang Syne? Old Lang Syne? Why are they all this?
[5600.06s -> 5612.01s]  It's all this one. Is this a popular one? Two minutes until New Year's on East Coast.
[5612.01s -> 5625.00s]  Old Lang Syne. Old Lang Syne. This is like Scottish. I just need old Lang Syne. I just need
[5625.64s -> 5638.92s]  royalty free with no lyrics. Royalty free, no lyrics. Old Lang Syne. Royalty free. Okay. All
[5638.92s -> 5646.79s]  right. Okay. Here we go. Welcome to 2021 in two minutes. We have two minutes. It's a Scottish
[5646.79s -> 5655.22s]  poem. It is. I don't want to even see that fucking underarm bullshit. We got one minute. I gotta,
[5655.22s -> 5664.28s]  we gotta count this down. We're almost there. We're getting close. These are like almost done.
[5664.28s -> 5670.92s]  Should I take these off? We're probably gonna be able to count down the Pacific one too because
[5670.92s -> 5680.57s]  there's like lots left for me to do here. 30 seconds till New Year's. I'm in Pacific so it's
[5680.57s -> 5687.80s]  not New Year's for me but we'll celebrate East Coast nonetheless. Here we go. The ball's about
[5687.80s -> 5695.51s]  to drop in New York City. Do it in your Boston accent. All right. Yeah. You want me to do it in
[5695.51s -> 5701.14s]  the old Lang Syne in my Boston accent? All right. Let's see if I can get it back. And a five, four,
[5701.70s -> 5707.38s]  three, two, one. Happy fucking New Year. And a
[5712.50s -> 5726.33s]  their old Lang Syne. And all the Red Sox players should fucking get paid more than the Yankees do.
[5728.66s -> 5738.58s]  And all the Patriots who cares about Tom Brady. He's a fucking loser. I don't even fucking care.
[5740.63s -> 5750.07s]  And all the Revolution was a soccer team and the Bruins. And fuck you for fucking talking shit to
[5750.07s -> 5757.22s]  me about my mother behind my back that one time that year and I fucking never forgot. Happy New
[5757.22s -> 5772.90s]  Year. Happy New Year all you East Coasters. We'll keep going. Thanks for spending it here with me.
[5772.90s -> 5792.65s]  We'll keep moving on. Acquaintance be forgot and all before Lang Syne and all acquaintance be
[5793.53s -> 5803.77s]  for God and I lots of time. I don't, nobody knows the lyrics. They all just hum it. Whenever you see
[5803.77s -> 5808.41s]  people like shifting back and forth and the big crowds at New Year's, none of them know what the
[5808.41s -> 5829.45s]  song is. They're all just going like this. Nobody knows what the fuck the lyrics are to this song.
[5829.45s -> 5842.07s]  And let me be the first to ruin your New Year with best Aaron. That's a good, you're right.
[5842.07s -> 5855.69s]  I'm just shit my pants when I did that. I actually almost just shit my pants for real.
[5855.69s -> 5859.69s]  I'm not kidding. That was actually almost. I almost shit my pants right now on. Thank God it
[5859.69s -> 5867.77s]  wasn't on camera. Someone that goes, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.
[5867.77s -> 5875.21s]  I've never done that. I'm back to easy. We, we, that's
[5878.38s -> 5885.82s]  Aaron. Um, stop. Stop. It's a test. Aaron. What is that? What's Aaron? What's Aaron?
[5886.54s -> 5895.14s]  What is that? What's Aaron? Why are they saying Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron. Oh shit. You're gonna
[5895.14s -> 5898.46s]  know who I am. No. Oh, what I meant to say was,
[5901.64s -> 5906.36s]  that's fun. That's not funny. I'm doing an impression of Armin from attack on Titan.
[5907.08s -> 5911.96s]  I'm just doing it. I just got, I have to, I'll do it over here. So it's not as loud.
[5913.72s -> 5919.08s]  I'm sorry. I have, I do have no idea. You know what it's like to fucking live with me.
[5919.72s -> 5932.18s]  Oh, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, run away, Aaron. Do Hercule. Oh, I can do that. Look,
[5932.18s -> 5937.78s]  that's, I love that character in attack on Titan. Oh, right. I love when that character shows up
[5937.78s -> 5947.86s]  and says, I am the strongest person on earth. What do you know about that one? Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.
[5947.86s -> 5954.14s]  Didn't say it in the funny voice. Aaron. No, that wasn't even the right one. Aaron. There you go.
[5954.70s -> 5962.33s]  You get that like once a week. Those whose eyes are clouded are besieged by the ghosts that haunt them.
[5962.33s -> 5979.86s]  Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.
[5979.86s -> 5986.71s]  Okay. There you go. So I know you said, shut up. You must be one of the two. You should have voted
[5986.71s -> 6007.10s]  no. Why did you want me to do that? 76% of you told me to do that. The winner this year and the
[6007.10s -> 6021.06s]  only year for best Aaron is at 17% of the vote. 76% of you voted for this. The last one you just
[6021.06s -> 6031.32s]  heard. It was bad. I didn't stop. I just kept going. I kept doing it. I didn't pause. Microphone Aaron
[6031.32s -> 6043.35s]  was at 13 and Goku Aaron was at 12. All right. We're going to do one more. No, no, we're not.
[6043.35s -> 6052.54s]  No, we're not. Oh my God. Yeah, we should. We did two more. All right. Sometimes on this stream,
[6052.54s -> 6059.94s]  I like to do impressions. Sometimes on this stream, I like to do impressions. Whether that's Obama,
[6059.94s -> 6065.64s]  or whether that's Homer Simpson, or whether that's how much you've lost on a coin toss.
[6065.64s -> 6069.56s]  I like to do impressions. I like to just kind of say things and do things, right?
[6070.12s -> 6078.17s]  Sometimes they're better than others. Sometimes impressions are bad. I'm just giving context to
[6078.17s -> 6085.45s]  people. That's not me doing an impression. That was context. Sometimes I do impressions and we're
[6085.45s -> 6089.35s]  going to start with the best. So these are the best. No, we're going to start with the worst
[6089.35s -> 6094.65s]  because I want people to see how good I am later. These are the worst impressions of the year.
[6094.65s -> 6107.14s]  Sometimes they're good. Sometimes they're bad. I can't tell you how to feel either way, but we're
[6107.14s -> 6116.02s]  going to start with the worst. No, let's start with the best foot forward. Best foot forward.
[6116.02s -> 6122.28s]  These are the nominees for best impression of the year. Here we go. Best impression.
[6153.80s -> 6157.08s]  Banned me if I'm wrong. I bet you can't do a perfect wolf howl on stream right now.
[6157.72s -> 6164.22s]  Banned that guy for life. Banned that guy again if he's still here. Banned that guy for life.
[6164.22s -> 6166.38s]  Banned him for life. He doesn't get to come back. Banned him if he's here right now. He
[6166.38s -> 6169.26s]  does not get to come back. Banned that guy permanently. He does not get to come back.
[6187.08s -> 6193.48s]  You go play the sounds that I just made. The ones I just made.
[6194.90s -> 6199.22s]  Play it. I want to hear it. Clip it. I want to hear it. I never yelled. It was like...
[6200.02s -> 6208.86s]  I'd just be sitting there going like...
[6218.30s -> 6221.18s]  Vodwatcher right now was able to go like this.
[6226.07s -> 6228.63s]  Okay, so we're going to play Deltarune now. We're going to start the game now.
[6239.40s -> 6244.92s]  My territory. And I will let you leave.
[6245.72s -> 6248.84s]  You imitate the sounds of shoes squeaking on a basketball court. Yeah.
[6249.56s -> 6268.74s]  Oh, hey, guys. Hey, you ever pick up the phone and somebody... It's a wrong number.
[6268.74s -> 6274.58s]  And you say, oh, hey, wrong number. Hey, screw you, buddy. You know what I mean? That's plus two.
[6274.58s -> 6278.90s]  No, no, no, no, no. Get the fuck out of here.
[6286.97s -> 6293.50s]  Car noise. It's like...
[6297.50s -> 6324.38s]  This one's not going to be close. The winner for best impression of the year
[6325.34s -> 6338.92s]  goes to... You probably could guess it. It was Spampton. At 31% of the vote, Spampton, which
[6339.56s -> 6346.73s]  I've seen a lot of people say they liked the Spampton voice. I was just kind of fucking around.
[6346.73s -> 6353.53s]  If you liked it, I'm glad you did. I was just having fun. Chat chimps at 12% and then skipping
[6353.53s -> 6364.44s]  through the VOD at 15%. Here are your best impressions of the year, apparently. It was
[6364.44s -> 6370.97s]  an interpretation. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's what I said. Chimps got robbed. Well, you just
[6370.97s -> 6378.55s]  want chimps to win because you are a chat chimp. You got bias. So with the best comes the worst.
[6378.55s -> 6382.70s]  And these are the ones... It's funny because people are probably watching right now going,
[6384.07s -> 6390.54s]  oh, dude, half of those were dog shit. Well, just wait till you hear the ones that weren't
[6390.54s -> 6394.38s]  nominated for best of the year. Wait till you see the ones that were nominated for the worst
[6394.38s -> 6404.76s]  of the year. And I gotta... Okay, I have to defend myself right now. I don't... Sometimes I just sit
[6404.76s -> 6410.68s]  here and I just talk and I just like do somebody else's voice or something. And I'm not even trying
[6410.68s -> 6415.00s]  to do it. I'm not trying to do an impression. I just do Donald Duck. I'm just like, all right,
[6415.00s -> 6418.36s]  I'm going to do... I'll do Donald Duck right now. That sounds like kind of a fun time.
[6418.36s -> 6422.82s]  And then people go, oh, hey, that sucked. And I go, all right, well then fucking nominate it already.
[6422.82s -> 6427.70s]  Here are your nominees for worst impression of the year. And you all know who won. So who cares?
[6427.70s -> 6438.42s]  Let's go. Worst impression of the year. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode
[6438.42s -> 6443.86s]  one of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft. This is going to be a single player
[6443.86s -> 6450.02s]  let's play. And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this
[6450.02s -> 6458.65s]  game. What are you talking about? Are you sure we don't have to go fix the grandma's recipe?
[6459.61s -> 6462.89s]  No, Chippendale. You've got to go to a foreign fucking land and you've got to start
[6462.89s -> 6469.05s]  shooting at stuff. What are you talking about? That's how you treat it.
[6469.05s -> 6481.05s]  You want to impression Bowser? Okay. Peter Dactyl. I've turned into a pterodactyl. I am now
[6481.05s -> 6488.90s]  Peter Dactyl. He flies and smashes right into the side of like Cleveland's house.
[6488.90s -> 6492.18s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft,
[6492.18s -> 6496.98s]  the series where I play Minecraft. This is going to be a single player let's play. And I say,
[6496.98s -> 6501.94s]  when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely because I am a stupid idiot dumb ass
[6501.94s -> 6506.98s]  in this game. You're going to see lots of you. That's a fake one. Audition for Waluigi right
[6506.98s -> 6521.62s]  now. All right. Everybody cheated, but me. Jesus Christ. This should have won. That should have won.
[6521.62s -> 6527.22s]  Did I get the part? You sound like Homer Simpson today. Well, thanks. I appreciate that.
[6527.94s -> 6542.25s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. There it is. Fuck off. I got it. Oh, Joe, Joe, the Bionicles.
[6542.25s -> 6544.97s]  They're never going to make it. I don't think they're going to make it, Joe.
[6545.85s -> 6548.57s]  Chad, what do you guys think? Will you just shut up, man?
[6550.82s -> 6562.57s]  What? Trying to watch the movie here. Ah, of course they're going to make it.
[6563.78s -> 6571.14s]  They're the damn Bionicles. Now hear me. Morning. How are you? It should be pleased you to know that
[6571.14s -> 6577.03s]  the purple Pikmin are lodged safely in my home. That wasn't Bernie. That was supposed to be
[6577.03s -> 6586.71s]  Arnold Schwarzenegger. Good morning. How are you? Fuck. That is Bernie. Good morning. How are you?
[6586.71s -> 6592.55s]  How are you? How are you? Good morning. Good morning. Fuck. Did you do Tommy Lee Jones?
[6592.71s -> 6601.58s]  I'll try. You do an impression of Daniel Day-Lewis in Where There Will Be Blood. Sure.
[6610.62s -> 6628.82s]  All right. I don't think the Daniel Day-Lewis one was that bad. Can I be honest? The Daniel
[6628.82s -> 6635.35s]  Day-Lewis one was more like feeling and like mannerism. It was more like an emotion.
[6636.17s -> 6645.27s]  It was. I wasn't. You know what I mean? Whatever. By the way, anybody that does an Arnold Schwarzenegger
[6645.27s -> 6653.19s]  impression, they're just going to do Bernie Sanders. Listen for it. If you can differentiate
[6653.19s -> 6670.95s]  yourself from Arnold to Bernie, you got a great fucking Arnold impression. Lois won with 21% of
[6670.95s -> 6676.33s]  the vote. And then Homer Simpson with 13. And then Chip and Dale. Chip and Dale. I think Chip
[6676.33s -> 6685.40s]  and Dale was the worst. That's cope. Yeah, that's fine. There it is. Lois is your winner with 21%.
[6685.40s -> 6691.88s]  Homer Simpson 13. Chip and Dale with 11. I think Chip and Dale was the worst by far. Chip and Dale
[6691.88s -> 6702.81s]  was so bad it hurt my ears listening back when I got the video to compile into OBS. It was awful.
[6702.81s -> 6710.26s]  And with that, we're going to move back to Germanium. We're going to go back to the German
[6710.26s -> 6714.74s]  Rumble. We still have about five or six matches to do before the Rumble. So we're going to move
[6714.74s -> 6721.98s]  this over here. Let's keep this going here. I hope you can't see it. All right. I think we're good.
[6723.91s -> 6735.16s]  On to the next match. This one's going to be interesting. Mitch McConnell should have been
[6735.16s -> 6743.69s]  on there. I think that was last year. I think it was. I think it was on last year. I just burped
[6743.69s -> 6752.26s]  and I'm so glad I fucking got rid of it. I'm going to need a refill soon here. We are definitely
[6752.26s -> 6756.18s]  going to count down the Pacific New Year's, by the way. There's no way we don't miss it.
[6756.90s -> 6771.56s]  There's so much more to do. You didn't see shit. I drink five times a year. Will you let me have
[6771.56s -> 6782.07s]  this? I drink five times a year. All right. The next is going to be a one on three tag match,
[6782.07s -> 6794.06s]  which could be very interesting. Here we go. Our next match is a one on three tag match,
[6794.06s -> 6805.10s]  handicap match. For those in the audience that were Dollhouse fans, this is a Dollhouse themed
[6805.10s -> 6812.92s]  matchup. Our first contestant is going to be Jerma from the Dollhouse, specifically wearing the
[6814.78s -> 6831.38s]  Cherubianship belt. That is Dollhouse Jerma. That's true. That's not true. One half of the
[6831.38s -> 6850.30s]  Jeremy? Is there another half? Yeah, that's me in the day one Dollhouse outfit and I am facing three
[6850.30s -> 6861.10s]  people at the same time. Well, it's a tag match. Trying to think of who I would really be kind of
[6861.10s -> 6866.50s]  annoyed with. Three people in particular that I just, God, they got on my nerves. They were
[6866.50s -> 6878.26s]  always around me. They were always causing problems. I could sense them. I heard them.
[6878.26s -> 6886.98s]  I could feel them in the room with me. And even still, when I go back and watch footage,
[6886.98s -> 6899.69s]  I'm still surprised of their existence. And I don't believe it a lot of the time. People tell me,
[6899.69s -> 6907.54s]  oh, no, this happened. This happened. I'm like, no, it didn't. That's so weird. And I got the belt
[6907.54s -> 6920.49s]  too. Some of you are guessing what it is and some of you got it right. Bald is beautiful. I'm not
[6920.49s -> 6929.74s]  bald and I'm 36. Do you understand how awesome that is? I am not bald and I'm 36. Holy smokes.
[6929.74s -> 6937.29s]  I can say that. That's awesome. I probably won't make it to 40, but who knows? We'll find out.
[6937.85s -> 6943.51s]  Thank you for joining me on this New Year's, by the way. And I'm doing my tuber voice because
[6943.51s -> 6953.98s]  we're doing commentary on the wrestling, of course. And who I am facing is the dastardly,
[6953.98s -> 6965.62s]  the sneaky, the strange, the out of the ordinary, the paralysis demon-like shadow moving people.
[6966.26s -> 6978.49s]  Three of the shadow movers in a furniture matchup. I believe this is a tables,
[6978.49s -> 6987.22s]  ladders, and chairs match. This is shadow mover one. And I think they have the same entrance,
[6987.22s -> 6991.14s]  so I don't know if we need to do shadow mover two and threes entrance, but they are terrifying.
[6995.34s -> 7007.03s]  Get them. I will skip this because it's two more of the same intro, but we'll wait for the
[7007.03s -> 7011.59s]  prediction to be over because I don't want to start the match yet. I don't know if I would
[7011.59s -> 7025.30s]  vote for me. It's one V three. Although you might make money if I win. That'd be great.
[7026.02s -> 7043.02s]  How much pyrotechnics? Oh my God. Relax. He's using a lot of gas. Jesus. Yeah, it's three.
[7043.02s -> 7059.51s]  There are three shadow movers versus me. Let's go. Let's go. Just to prove it, it's three
[7059.51s -> 7064.95s]  shadow movers. Yeah. We're not going to do this three times. I'm not doing that three times.
[7066.68s -> 7070.60s]  Tables, ladders, and chairs match one V three handicap tag. Here we go.
[7071.70s -> 7081.86s]  All house, Jerma versus three shadow movers. Begin. Tag rules apply right off the bat.
[7083.75s -> 7094.09s]  Immediate pin. So I have to be careful here because I have to slow down.
[7094.89s -> 7099.32s]  Don't use all my strength. Don't miss kicks to the ground for no reason.
[7102.30s -> 7106.78s]  These are the guys that I heard about that were walking around during the dollhouse and moving
[7106.78s -> 7113.96s]  furniture. That's what I was told. What a weird experience that was. It's my revenge time.
[7113.96s -> 7133.21s]  Don't just stand there. What are you stupid? I got to go through three of them and I got good
[7133.21s -> 7144.41s]  stats. Let me tell you. Choking Jerma, dollhouse Jerma on the ropes while one of the three big
[7144.41s -> 7149.67s]  right hand onto Jerma nine eight five dollhouse Jerma nine eight five eight one. Tagging in one
[7149.67s -> 7156.26s]  of the other movers, which I believe they move in unison. I don't know if they're a single unit,
[7156.26s -> 7163.43s]  if they're a collective unit. They could be a hive mind. I don't know. This is sad.
[7164.95s -> 7171.13s]  Why is it sad? I didn't lose yet. Don't say that. I've only got a ladder in the goddamn ring.
[7175.75s -> 7183.40s]  Don't count me out just yet. Come on. Look at me. I'm getting really excited.
[7188.62s -> 7195.18s]  Oh, I just choked his neck. Okay. The ducky shirt is perfect. It really is.
[7200.52s -> 7206.71s]  Don't get stuck on the ropes and crash the damn game. Where else do you choke people?
[7207.80s -> 7215.34s]  Um, I don't know. You can choke them in the water. Don't win. Dude, you must have huge
[7215.34s -> 7219.10s]  sweat marks right now. I do. And you should have seen the sweat mark of the dollhouse.
[7219.66s -> 7224.47s]  I'm glad I get to change clothes. Now dollhouse Jerma going into the corner.
[7225.27s -> 7240.76s]  Does the gentle drop that you hear? I'm talking into my wine glass right now. Try deodorant.
[7243.83s -> 7248.79s]  Look, there's a huge difference between sitting around with a blaring ring light
[7248.79s -> 7255.91s]  and a hot ass room. And you're wicked excited for the rumble and the look at me, by the way.
[7255.91s -> 7269.43s]  Look at me taking fucking names here. I am taking names here. Or at least I was until you said
[7269.43s -> 7278.98s]  something. You probably have high blood sugar. No. All right. I don't need any medical Andes
[7278.98s -> 7293.16s]  to tell me what's wrong with me. I'm fine. Yeah. Let me go get a blood glue close monitor and
[7293.16s -> 7318.42s]  prick my finger. False count anywhere. I almost just won. What? My glue close my glue. Whatever.
[7318.42s -> 7336.12s]  Glenn close. What am I saying? You know what I'm saying. Big DDT on dollhouse Jerma. If I get pinned
[7336.12s -> 7341.72s]  I'm gonna be pissed. Don't lose right now. Are you fucking kidding me? What a shitty match.
[7342.52s -> 7363.30s]  That was awful. That was terrible. What was this move supposed to be?
[7364.81s -> 7373.58s]  What? Maybe if I grab him by his waist and hold him down on top of me, how am I not being pinned?
[7374.87s -> 7384.62s]  Was he pinning me? That was so stupid. What a terrible move. It was awful. The shadow movers
[7384.62s -> 7390.30s]  are your winner. We're not doing a rematch because that match was terrible. They didn't even get any
[7390.30s -> 7394.14s]  ladders, any chairs, or any tables. It was supposed to be a furniture match.
[7395.18s -> 7400.62s]  They did not care to take any of the furniture from under the ring. I just lost in five minutes.
[7401.18s -> 7421.43s]  Okay. On to the next one. Oh, this is gonna be good. This one's gonna be good. You got bodied.
[7421.43s -> 7426.38s]  It's a 3v1, man. I was gonna get my ass kicked no matter what. Unless I could get a table or
[7426.38s -> 7448.82s]  something. Let's go. Willem Dafoe. I almost spelt that all over me. All right. The next one coming
[7448.82s -> 7456.25s]  up is a false count anywhere for fatal four way. L ratio. Give me your keys. I'm not going. What
[7456.25s -> 7461.56s]  are you talking about? I'm gonna, my ass is going to be planted in this seat for the next like three
[7461.56s -> 7477.35s]  hours. I ain't going anywhere. All right. Here we go. The next match is a fatal four way.
[7478.07s -> 7483.53s]  And I would call this one the gamer match because I mean, here comes Pac-Man 99.
[7488.92s -> 7505.37s]  Pac-Man 99 from the fifth dimension. He what? P-A-C, man.
[7506.81s -> 7520.62s]  Pac-Man 99 is your first contestant. This is the gamer battle, like I told you. Fatal,
[7520.62s -> 7542.94s]  fatal four way. Let me copyright. Oh, please. Copyright. Our second contestant in this is,
[7542.94s -> 7547.91s]  of course, who could forget Cosmic Calamity from Monster Rancher 2.
[7552.79s -> 7560.18s]  I don't know how well this is going to play out because block wrestlers can crash the game
[7560.18s -> 7564.18s]  and they can fuck up the whole game. So if the game crashes, that's a huge problem.
[7567.24s -> 7573.66s]  That is Jerma's, why am I speaking in third person? It's mine. That is my Monster Rancher 2
[7573.66s -> 7580.52s]  character. Third person? What the fuck was that? Oh, that's Jerma's, the idea of mind?
[7581.24s -> 7592.65s]  That is Cosmic Calamity. Don't, stop chanting crash. I don't want the game to crash. Don't say
[7592.65s -> 7610.98s]  that. Captain Olimar from the Wii. I don't know what he's holding. What is that? Are they Pikmin
[7610.98s -> 7623.59s]  in that sack? What's in the sack? That's kind of fucked up. It's a great Olimar, by the way.
[7632.84s -> 7642.36s]  It's the Pikmin. Don't swing it around. What are you doing? If you missed my Pikmin playthrough,
[7642.36s -> 7648.95s]  I thought the Wii sucks and I thought the game sucks. I hate the Wii and I hate Pikmin.
[7648.95s -> 7674.10s]  Our next contestant is Anubis from Smite. My favorite Smite character, Anoa Bass?
[7677.93s -> 7689.80s]  Okay, I didn't know that. I didn't know that it was Anoa Bass. So we have Anubis,
[7689.80s -> 7700.10s]  Pacman99, Olimar, and Cosmic Calamity in a four-way. All right. I think it's Extreme
[7700.10s -> 7708.18s]  Rules 2. We'll find out in a second. I got my money on Cosmic Calamity or Anubis because I love
[7708.18s -> 7713.83s]  Smite. Everybody else hates it. It was nominated for worst stream of the year, by the way.
[7715.82s -> 7725.66s]  Four-way. Don't pin immediately. I actually kind of hope it happens. So Anubis and Cosmic
[7725.66s -> 7733.83s]  Calamity now in the corner. Already some drama. Prediction. I don't think we can do prediction.
[7735.43s -> 7741.45s]  Crash. Don't stop. I don't want the game to crash. Stop saying that. The Rumble is... Okay,
[7741.45s -> 7746.57s]  let me tell you something about the Rumble. The Rumble this year is like 22 characters that you
[7746.57s -> 7751.88s]  are not going to see. None of these fucking idiots are in the Rumble. Let me make that really clear.
[7752.89s -> 7757.77s]  None of these dickheads are in the Rumble. There were just so many characters this year.
[7762.18s -> 7778.33s]  All falls count anywhere. Who just hit their head? Please, I don't want the game to crash. God,
[7779.05s -> 7796.28s]  what you idiots. And Cosmic... I can't. Somebody said, where's the Among Us match?
[7799.62s -> 7807.78s]  You'll never see one on this channel. Never. So in the corner, Cosmic Calamity in Olimar.
[7809.26s -> 7814.33s]  Let's just throw somebody into the stairs 10 times in a row. That's great. Yeah, go ahead.
[7814.97s -> 7820.95s]  Hey, throw into the stairs again. Does anybody else want to throw somebody into the stairs?
[7820.95s -> 7831.46s]  Throw them into the stairs again. Will they do anything else? Do something besides throw into
[7831.46s -> 7849.43s]  stairs. Oh my God. I got an idea. I'll throw them into the stairs and then I'll try to pin them.
[7849.43s -> 7856.02s]  That'll work. Hey, you guys want them over there? I'll throw them over there. There's no stairs
[7856.02s -> 7858.98s]  over there, but I'll throw them that way. And then I'll do a fucking Fortnite dance.
[7861.19s -> 7876.41s]  Hi, dear. Leave me alone. I got an idea. Hey, I got an idea. How about Olimar grasping by the neck
[7876.41s -> 7887.02s]  and fucking twisting? All right, back in the ring. Olimar now throwing Calamity. No, reversal on the
[7887.02s -> 7893.70s]  ropes. Interesting. Put them into the turlet. I have no idea who... I think there's extreme rules
[7893.70s -> 7905.61s]  on this too. Big DDT by Cosmic Calamity while Lanubis and Pac-Man 99 are in the corner pushing
[7905.61s -> 7914.97s]  his foot into his neck or whatever that is. I don't know if he has a face. How come Cosmic's
[7914.97s -> 7924.28s]  not one-shotting everybody? Well, Cosmic Calamity has, I believe, like a hundred strength and zero
[7924.28s -> 7944.58s]  everything else, I think. So it's there. Going for the pin already. Threatening. Anubis Smite,
[7944.58s -> 7950.15s]  by the way, voted for one of the worst streams of the year. It is nominated for one of the worst
[7950.15s -> 7956.97s]  streams of the whole year. We'll find out what that is later on tonight. Big pin covering by
[7956.97s -> 7964.49s]  Anubis. No, huge suplex off the top turnbuckle by Olimar to Cosmic Calamity. How are we going
[7964.49s -> 7974.17s]  to see a victory already? No way. Anubis breaks that up. We've not seen a weapon. We've not seen
[7974.17s -> 7983.48s]  any attacks, chairs, sludge hammers. He just repeated himself three times. He's drunk.
[7983.48s -> 7995.03s]  That was a tombstone, but I'm going to start saying differently. I think Anubis just won.
[8000.41s -> 8010.47s]  I think Anubis almost just won right there. Anubis, you guys are fucking with me. Okay,
[8010.47s -> 8039.54s]  I got to relax. You're being too funny. All right, everybody relax. What is happening?
[8039.54s -> 8053.99s]  Big splash. No, only a two count. I'm not high. Just give me a second so I can reconvene my
[8053.99s -> 8075.59s]  brain. What did he do that for? Why did he do that? A big right hand by Anubis into a leg drop here.
[8076.15s -> 8087.32s]  Now, remember, false count anywhere. You guys are making me laugh. I got to fucking,
[8087.88s -> 8100.07s]  I got to hit the brakes. I just got it. What did I miss? A lot of categories, a lot of fun stuff.
[8102.82s -> 8110.41s]  Why did the referee is down? Watch the referee. Don't be an idiot. Don't hit the referee. He's
[8110.41s -> 8119.32s]  stupid. All right, somebody go through that table. I want someone to go through that table. Look at
[8119.32s -> 8123.32s]  how nice they look. They got the German 95 branded logo. Get them through the table for God's sakes.
[8129.54s -> 8140.62s]  Anubis with Cosmic Calamity into the stairs again. What else is new? The referee is like,
[8140.62s -> 8146.92s]  I should have to work. Your stream is lagging. I don't know why that shouldn't be happening.
[8148.97s -> 8154.81s]  All right, get back in the ring. Let's go back to zero. I'm fine. I'm having a great fucking time.
[8154.81s -> 8162.06s]  This is so much fun. Hope you're having a good time too. Anubis outside with Cosmic Calamity.
[8162.06s -> 8166.06s]  That's not even the right person. Oh my God, Jeremy. Fucking give me a break.
[8167.16s -> 8173.56s]  Olimar and Cosmic Calamity in the front of the ring, inside the middle as Calamity gets caught.
[8174.84s -> 8186.06s]  I'm not muted. Shut up. Olimar is waiting for it. Oh, that's a stunner. He got him with a stunner.
[8186.06s -> 8191.48s]  That's a stunner. Hackman99 is completely clueless, but finally got over there.
[8193.16s -> 8199.00s]  That was a stunner. That's his finishing move. Game's not muted. Leave me alone.
[8202.07s -> 8220.25s]  Big spin. You're doing your best. I'm surprised. Why has nobody been pinned?
[8223.19s -> 8227.03s]  I did not think this was going to go this long as Anubis and Cosmic Calamity.
[8230.66s -> 8235.61s]  All right, get him on the top rope. Suplex on the top rope. Let's see it, Anubis.
[8235.61s -> 8241.78s]  Oh, I'm not stupid. I can see the OBS meters going up. I'm not dumb.
[8243.53s -> 8248.65s]  Big hurricane run of reverse. No, back. Belly to back suplex off the top rope. Anubis to Cosmic
[8248.65s -> 8257.51s]  Calamity. That's huge. He may as well just use his ult. Anubis just ulted Cosmic Calamity. Can he?
[8257.51s -> 8265.42s]  Why? Don't. Just keep him on the ground, you idiot. What a fucking idiot. What a dumb ass.
[8270.66s -> 8275.91s]  Why would you not pin him? I'm not muted. Stop minus twoing. What's wrong with you guys?
[8275.91s -> 8283.10s]  Leave me alone. Who is being pinned? You can't even see that from here.
[8287.78s -> 8301.13s]  That referee could not even see the pin he was counting. What's happening? He can't even
[8301.13s -> 8312.57s]  see. As Olimar grabs Pac-Man 99 going up onto the top here under his shoulders.
[8314.42s -> 8319.69s]  That's huge. Olimar could take it away right now. Olimar, take it away right now.
[8321.14s -> 8330.28s]  Go for a pin. End it. Stop throwing people into... Oh my god. Pin. Somebody pin.
[8334.18s -> 8341.58s]  Big suplex. No. What was that? That's it. But who wins? I don't know. What?
[8341.58s -> 8359.61s]  What? He's been pinning for way longer. It was over. Olimar wins. Olimar wins. What the
[8359.61s -> 8370.71s]  fuck was that? He started counting for the guys on the left and didn't do Olimar's pin. What?
[8372.30s -> 8377.35s]  The ref is drunk too? All right. Hide the champagne bottles from the rest of them. All of us.
[8382.30s -> 8395.03s]  I can't believe Olimar didn't win. The ref is shit faced. Another stunner. All right.
[8395.03s -> 8405.03s]  Olimar win the game right now. Oh my god. Everybody's shit faced. They were taking
[8405.03s -> 8411.06s]  shots of fireball backstage and that's always a bad idea. Don't ever let anyone convince you
[8411.06s -> 8420.04s]  that's a good idea. Hey man, you want to take shots of fireball? No is always the answer.
[8421.14s -> 8441.06s]  No is always the answer. Always. There's a two count. That's it. Cosmic calamity. I don't
[8441.06s -> 8447.24s]  know why they didn't count the Olimar outside. That was horseshit. Cosmic calamity is your
[8447.24s -> 8453.11s]  winner of the four person gamer battle. That was rigged. I'll be honest. That was fucked up.
[8454.74s -> 8463.96s]  There is no reason why Olimar should not have won. I agree with you. It's really messed up. Not
[8463.96s -> 8472.33s]  cool. I mean, I love Cosmic Calamity. They're a great character, but I don't think they should
[8472.33s -> 8483.10s]  have won. Not a chance. You did not have to be in the ring. You just had to pin somebody somewhere.
[8483.58s -> 8495.13s]  And that is that one. We only have a few more matches left till the rumble. We have a lot of
[8495.13s -> 8511.58s]  categories to get through. So we'll go back to the categories. I didn't rig it. I swear to god.
[8511.58s -> 8521.46s]  Okay. P break. All right. We'll take one P break here. Go pee. Go put some water on your face.
[8521.46s -> 8546.62s]  You know, go take a second. We'll be right back. He's plastered. I'm really not though. I'm just
[8546.62s -> 8552.76s]  having a good time. It's been a fucking blast. I'm happy to share it with all of you. I'll be right
[8552.76s -> 8856.26s]  back. I'm all right. I'm all right. Don't worry about me. I'll be right back. Okay. Hello. How
[8856.26s -> 8864.87s]  are you? Welcome back. We have more categories to go through. Quite a few more. So let's get them
[8864.87s -> 8885.19s]  done. Let me make sure this is in the right spot. It is. Okay. Cool. Looks good. Okay. Not much
[8885.19s -> 8889.67s]  longer till we have to get rid of the Christmas BRB screen. How was my poop? It was awesome.
[8889.75s -> 8903.32s]  Now we're good. Okay. Hi. How are you? Coming up next. This is the meaty categories. No. Oh yeah.
[8903.32s -> 8914.34s]  These are meaty. We're going to start with the best joke. Taking more than five minutes to set up.
[8914.34s -> 8922.68s]  Seven minutes. Seven minutes for what? Oh shit. Yeah, you're right. Central time. That's right.
[8922.68s -> 8928.36s]  All right. So every year there's a lot of jokes that I do. A lot of things that I think are funny
[8928.36s -> 8934.04s]  that I hope are funny. But sometimes they're good. Sometimes they're bad. So this is what
[8934.04s -> 8940.89s]  people have nominated for the best jokes of the year. Best jokes of the year. So we're getting
[8940.89s -> 8948.73s]  into a big category here. This is a huge category. So here are your nominees for best joke of the
[8948.73s -> 8975.21s]  year. Taking more than five minutes to set up. Was it blood in my stool? Griffin family. Stewie,
[8975.21s -> 8980.57s]  it's time for school. I should not have to go to school. We got this new friend,
[8980.57s -> 8988.62s]  German985. He's here hanging out with us. I will make my secret hot tuck it Pete beer cheese
[8988.62s -> 9001.61s]  pretzels. Give me that. Come on. 71 million sprints. And that's a coin.
[9002.57s -> 9021.61s]  That's 3.1 million limes. Hey, get yourself some nice. This is why he's green.
[9023.80s -> 9033.22s]  Only funny voices. Wait, only funny voices for 20 straight minutes. I don't know if I can do that.
[9033.22s -> 9039.14s]  It's very difficult to do this and still play the video game at the same time. I'll tell you it's
[9039.14s -> 9046.18s]  not easy. This is Bernie. This is Bernie. If Bernie is morphing into a bunch of things,
[9046.82s -> 9052.90s]  Bernie is morphing into German guy again. Not a slip. This is non-slip. This is
[9053.70s -> 9061.56s]  rockabob. That's not a slip. That sounds sort of like the way that I kind of talk a little.
[9061.64s -> 9071.13s]  But now you make me go. Here we go. You grab her. Please eat her. Eat her, please.
[9072.49s -> 9083.34s]  Wait, he's still in the cut scene. He's still in the cut scene. Wait, he's blocking.
[9105.85s -> 9121.11s]  Okay. I'm going to go for a bite. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.
[9121.91s -> 9130.65s]  Oh my God. It's so good.
[9137.16s -> 9142.28s]  Okay. So I was at the store yesterday and I got a Dunkin Donuts large iced coffee.
[9143.72s -> 9148.20s]  And dude, I'm telling you, it was fucking gross. It was the grossest coffee I've ever had in my life.
[9148.20s -> 9157.96s]  It was disgusting. Oh, hey guys. Hey, you ever pick up the phone and somebody, it's a wrong number
[9157.96s -> 9163.56s]  and you say, oh, hey, wrong number. Hey, I screw you buddy. You know what I mean? Like that's plus
[9163.56s -> 9185.02s]  two. We're not going to use this anywhere, Roger. You don't need to hear me. Oh, but go hit that
[9185.02s -> 9192.49s]  follow button if you could. Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron. Oh shit. You're going to know who I am.
[9193.54s -> 9203.03s]  No. Oh, what I meant to say was, oh, no, I just, you don't know who I am. I'm the secret streamer.
[9203.03s -> 9208.79s]  I figured you out. I'm contacting the thieves. Oh yeah. Look at you. Look at me. Look at you.
[9208.79s -> 9214.31s]  You think you know who this is? What an idiot. What an idiot. You guys want to fuck with new
[9214.31s -> 9219.35s]  viewers? Okay. So I'm going to get a royalty free song. That's like with a bit, like a lot of drums.
[9219.35s -> 9224.87s]  I will, I'm going to full cam and just be like fucking like playing like air drums and like
[9224.87s -> 9236.41s]  people get into it and shit. I can't, I can't, I can't do it. I can't.
[9248.07s -> 9251.99s]  Yo, German on a five here. Just want to say, Oh, I did. I said, excuse me. Is it somebody's birthday
[9251.99s -> 9258.63s]  today? Oh, of course it is. Happy birthday. I'm so happy to see you on your birthday. I was told
[9258.63s -> 9265.35s]  you're a big fan and I'm, I'm coming to you personally. Tyler. Hey, Tyler, Lois. I'm fucking
[9265.35s -> 9269.75s]  done. I'm done. There's a, how many names are there in existence? There's too many. Hey, Bernie,

[9280.02s -> 9288.09s]  laughing. Paul. Why is this one so hard? Paul. What the fuck is wrong with me? You ready for the great
[9288.09s -> 9301.19s]  fucking reveal? Collectible monster card packs. Holy shit. Pokemon cards. What is this? What is
[9301.19s -> 9305.43s]  Grotto Beasts? Razzle Puss? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Look at this
[9305.43s -> 9313.38s]  one. Look at this one. This one, this is a cut to my face. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick cut to
[9313.38s -> 9321.26s]  my face. A foil Razzle Puss. You found the company. How much is it worth? Like $350,000.
[9321.42s -> 9329.18s]  $350,000. It's $350,000 for the GrottoBeasts.com is what we found. Yeah, buy it. Buy it. Buy it right
[9329.18s -> 9336.04s]  now. You got, you got access to my checking account. Get it. Come on up here. Come on.
[9339.66s -> 9347.02s]  Happy new year. You'll get up here eventually. I know you will. He's picking the tables up.
[9347.58s -> 9366.87s]  Come on up here. This is it. It's in this area here. I'm gonna find that goddamn treasure and
[9366.95s -> 9373.03s]  I'll be the first one to close that out. I don't want to go backwards. Oh, I can't believe.
[9373.03s -> 9375.83s]  Jerma, how do you know how to use that? But you don't think I fucking know everything?
[9376.55s -> 9380.55s]  You don't think I know how to use one of these? I worked for 10 years in the industry.
[9380.55s -> 9397.78s]  Give me a break. Okay, so this one is pretty interesting because, uh, happy new year.
[9397.86s -> 9398.90s]  Central. Oh, hold on.
[9414.15s -> 9420.89s]  Happy new year, Central. The best joke taking more than five minutes to set up.
[9420.89s -> 9431.56s]  Which is, this is actually really surprising. I am shocked by this one. The winner of the best joke
[9431.56s -> 9435.58s]  taking more than five minutes. This is a shocker. I think a lot of people get this an upset.
[9438.34s -> 9449.86s]  It's an upset. What? Leave me alone. Bought a Whopper and ate it on stream with 19% of the vote.
[9449.86s -> 9458.42s]  That's the winner. Drumming, rock out break and grotto beasts were pretty much tied. Buying a
[9458.42s -> 9466.26s]  Whopper and eating it on stream, you guys thought was better than anything else of the whole year.
[9466.26s -> 9475.02s]  I just ate a Whopper on camera. I ate Burger King on camera. I ate Burger King on camera.
[9476.95s -> 9482.22s]  Uh, drumming was 12% in second place. That was a pretty good one. I thought that wasn't fun.
[9483.02s -> 9491.75s]  That one was very fun. It was rigged. It was not rigged. So just like the best,
[9491.75s -> 9497.48s]  let's go ahead and do the worst. These are the worst things I did the whole year.
[9497.48s -> 9506.36s]  These are the worst jokes I've ever made in all of 2021. Not proud of these. I'm ashamed of these.
[9506.36s -> 9511.02s]  Uh, here are your nominees, just like the best. Here are your nominees for the worst jokes
[9511.02s -> 9519.75s]  of the year. That took more than five minutes to set up. Embarrassing. Here we go.
[9527.99s -> 9538.10s]  And then we'll do, hmm, it's going to be a cake. Fuck the haters, right? Fuck the haters. I'm
[9538.10s -> 9543.51s]  putting marshmallows on my building. Fuck the haters. And they have to be different sizes too.
[9543.51s -> 9552.89s]  Oh my God. This is so omega ooey gooey. Dripping. That was cheesy. What, are people bored? Are you
[9552.89s -> 9558.57s]  bored? Oh, well I'm whatever. Look at this. I'm making a masterpiece. No, all right. I'm not,
[9558.57s -> 9563.88s]  I'm not messing with it anymore. I'm not messing with it anymore. It's over. I did it. There it is.
[9563.88s -> 9569.48s]  The Gronk's ice cream city hall. I don't know why I want to like make two cams. I have one of them
[9569.48s -> 9573.72s]  be blue and the other one be red and put them right next to each other transparent and like
[9573.72s -> 9577.64s]  give you like a 3d show. I'm coming at you. I'm coming at you.
[9584.65s -> 9605.61s]  Okay. I'm going to go for a bite. Oh my God. Why is this here? You can't have best and worst joke
[9605.61s -> 9623.42s]  of the year. It's so stupid. Oh my God. It's so good. You guys want to fuck with new viewers?
[9623.42s -> 9627.98s]  Okay. So I'm going to get a royalty free song. That's like with a bit, like a lot of drums.
[9627.98s -> 9633.26s]  I will, I'm going to full can also on best of the year be like fucking like playing like air drums
[9633.26s -> 9640.20s]  and like people get into it and shit. Look at how split of a community we really have.
[9642.76s -> 9647.88s]  It was people hated this, but they loved it on the other side. Right. It's so funny.
[9656.97s -> 9661.85s]  Okay. I will do a, I will do a welcome to German craft as the entire Griffin family. Hello,
[9661.85s -> 9666.57s]  ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one of German craft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[9667.05s -> 9670.89s]  This is going to be a single player. Let's play. And I say, when I say let's play,
[9670.89s -> 9675.13s]  I use that term pretty loosely because I have a stupid idiot dumb ass in this game.
[9675.77s -> 9679.05s]  You're going to see lots of you. That's a fake one. All right. I'm starting to see residence
[9679.05s -> 9682.49s]  sleepers. I got to go. I have to get this done right now. I don't care. It's a billion off the
[9682.49s -> 9689.70s]  dead. I don't give a shit how it sounds. I'm seeing residents sleepers. I gotta go. Hello,
[9689.70s -> 9695.06s]  ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one of German craft. This is fucking Jesus Christ.
[9695.22s -> 9697.78s]  Oh, one, two, three.
[9704.26s -> 9719.90s]  What's in there? I'm not sure. Oh my God. It's, it's Minecraft diamond. This is like what I see
[9719.90s -> 9725.98s]  when I look down in the bathtub. Okay. Like it's just like, Oh, there it is. A deformed penis.
[9726.54s -> 9731.26s]  That's not, this is like what your dick does when you just are sitting around hanging out in your
[9731.26s -> 9736.94s]  living room. Okay. This is what it looks like. It's like pushed up against your pants. All right.
[9736.94s -> 9742.14s]  I'm done. If you sit in the bathtub, if you're lying in the bathtub and you are lying back and
[9742.14s -> 9749.32s]  you look down, it's going to look like this. I'm sorry, but I have to do this. It's like,
[9756.54s -> 9764.38s]  what do you want me to say? That's TOS. That is a piece of frosting that I can't wait to never mind.
[9768.17s -> 9777.46s]  Oh shit. And then we'll do.
[9782.63s -> 9787.59s]  Fuck the haters, right? Fuck the haters. I didn't mean to click. I'm so sorry. I'm putting marshmallows
[9787.59s -> 9791.11s]  in my building. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'll fix it. I'll fix it.
[9791.11s -> 9799.80s]  Different sizes too. Oh my God. This is so omega ooey gooey. Just dripping. I didn't mean to click
[9799.80s -> 9805.32s]  that. God damn it. Are you bored? Oh, well, I'm whatever. I guess we're going to watch it again.
[9805.32s -> 9810.20s]  I'm making a mess. I'm so pissed. It was one more. I'm not messing with it anymore. It's over.
[9810.20s -> 9814.04s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got it. I got it. There it is. The Gronk's ice cream city hall.
[9817.62s -> 9835.67s]  We'll get there. Hold on. I can't. Son of a. God damn it. I didn't mean to. I swear to God,
[9835.67s -> 9849.08s]  didn't mean to do that. While that's on, we have to get to the last part. Just played in VLC.
[9851.11s -> 9859.06s]  It'll take two seconds. Just relax. It's got five seconds. Relax.
[9865.78s -> 9869.22s]  I did not. I'm sorry. I promise. I did not mean to do that. I promise.
[9869.22s -> 9888.60s]  An idiot. I'll be on cam for a minute. Okay. It's in the background. That's fine.
[9890.81s -> 9900.31s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's fine. Sure. Minecraft series where I play it. Yep. I got to
[9900.31s -> 9924.60s]  go. Resident sleepers. Yep. Yep. He's still going. Okay. We saw that one. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[9928.74s -> 9933.46s]  The winner of the worst. I'll just tell you. Who cares? It was by a landslide.
[9933.46s -> 9949.56s]  It was by a goddamn landslide. Who cares? Wait, stop. Stop. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.
[9955.56s -> 9980.36s]  Why won't it slow down? Oh my God. You piece of crap. It won't slow down. And your winner of worst
[9980.36s -> 9987.82s]  joke of the year, taking more than five minutes to set up with 26% of the vote.
[9990.38s -> 9996.30s]  Family guy. Germacraft. Y'all know it was going to win. And then bought a whopper and aided on
[9996.30s -> 10006.50s]  stream. It's insane. It's insane. Because the whopper, like it was like 20% in both worst and
[10006.50s -> 10013.42s]  best. That doesn't make any sense. And then the archaeology Minecraft diamond at 14%.
[10015.59s -> 10022.97s]  The family guy germacraft thing was a disaster. I'm embarrassed publicly. It was awful. Best
[10022.97s -> 10034.82s]  accident. It was best and worst. But yeah, but that just shows how like completely disconnected
[10034.82s -> 10039.24s]  everybody is here. Half of you thought it was the best. Half of you thought it was the worst.
[10042.39s -> 10055.45s]  Let's do two more. Two more categories. This is so fucked. Okay. These two. Don't even look at the
[10055.45s -> 10061.10s]  label of these two. There's no reason to look at the label. You don't have to look. It's the same
[10061.10s -> 10072.81s]  damn category. It doesn't matter. There were 200, 200 nominees for best and worst noise of the year.
[10072.81s -> 10081.45s]  The most we've ever seen. The most noise nominations ever by plus 100. There were so many
[10081.45s -> 10092.02s]  nominees. I have to like reel it in in 2022. I'm going to reel it in. I'm going to relax.
[10092.02s -> 10097.24s]  I'm going to try to stop, make it because I'm going to try to be a normal human being in 2022.
[10097.24s -> 10104.98s]  How much of a crazy person do you have to be? Do you have your best noise category? Have a hundred
[10104.98s -> 10111.70s]  and fucking 25 nominations. We had to drop it down to like 20 and that's all that's that's still
[10111.70s -> 10122.25s]  that's too many. That's way too many. Here are your nominees for best noise of the year. That
[10122.25s -> 10139.05s]  includes burps, sneezes, like yells, pukes. Best noise of the year. Here we go. Aaron, excuse me.
[10146.36s -> 10152.86s]  I think all whipped cream is great. I don't know what's the hate to whipped cream.
[10153.34s -> 10158.57s]  Am I muted right now? Oh, hey, you are. You were muted for a second. Sorry. What were you saying?
[10158.57s -> 10160.33s]  Yeah, I was just saying.
[10161.85s -> 10173.50s]  Hijack the data. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[10173.50s -> 10181.11s]  What are you trying to do? Rip me off?
[10183.91s -> 10194.68s]  Don't get sucked into a war hole. Do a funny sound effect.
[10196.76s -> 10210.78s]  I'm going to stealth kill the mortar guy.
[10213.13s -> 10221.45s]  Oh my God. All right, we're fine. Come out here. Get rid of the rabbit.
[10222.25s -> 10232.12s]  Oh, what happened? No, I was trying to fill the dead air.
[10236.15s -> 10239.35s]  Now watch. She's going to come try to like kiss me and I'm going to go.
[10242.63s -> 10246.47s]  And I'm going to push her away. Watch. I'm not going to do anything. That's the quickest way to
[10246.47s -> 10253.91s]  get disinvited to anything else in the future is being in that general chat with like 15 people
[10253.91s -> 10258.87s]  and being like, Hey, hey, pick the beaver and that's the kind of the beaver goes.
[10258.87s -> 10261.99s]  If he breaks that down and then he goes on the corn.
[10261.99s -> 10265.43s]  And then I put the horse in there and they'd be like, all right,
[10265.43s -> 10268.55s]  you're like, okay, fucking can you stop like, can you leave the call? Like, stop.
[10268.55s -> 10271.27s]  We're trying to like set this up. Watch him go on the right side.
[10272.38s -> 10276.94s]  Oh, no. No, he did it. He did the same exact arrows that he got hit with.
[10277.66s -> 10279.58s]  Oh, la la. Damn it.
[10279.58s -> 10284.62s]  I don't have enough room.
[10284.62s -> 10290.11s]  He does this only for the power.
[10290.11s -> 10294.07s]  He got me killed.
[10294.07s -> 10319.12s]  Somebody came in here and like killed me and muted the microphone right by.
[10319.12s -> 10322.73s]  How?
[10322.73s -> 10324.09s]  Oh a burger.
[10324.09s -> 10329.23s]  Can you talk while inhaling at the same time?
[10329.23s -> 10330.23s]  Hi.
[10330.23s -> 10331.23s]  Nope.
[10331.23s -> 10343.97s]  Please don't.
[10343.97s -> 10349.63s]  So not to confuse you, that was best noise of the year.
[10349.63s -> 10366.66s]  The winner of best noise of 2021 deranged with laughter followed closely by lala at
[10366.66s -> 10374.69s]  10% deranged with 11% and fill the dead air with 10%.
[10374.69s -> 10379.66s]  This was so close, it was impossible to even just differentiate.
[10379.66s -> 10391.70s]  Lala lost by like 0.8% the deranged laughter one and then filled the dead air right after.
[10391.70s -> 10398.21s]  So pretend like you didn't hear the category, if you're like oh noise, best noise, yeah
[10398.21s -> 10401.05s]  don't matter.
[10401.05s -> 10404.85s]  Here's the worst noise of the year.
[10404.85s -> 10411.64s]  I would put your volume down like 10 to 20% I would say, maybe 5%.
[10411.64s -> 10414.87s]  Some of these are probably really annoying.
[10414.87s -> 10429.02s]  Here are the nominees for the worst noise of the year.
[10429.02s -> 10435.50s]  Alright now you pissed me off.
[10435.50s -> 10452.59s]  Wouldn't be the first time you abandoned the channel.
[10452.59s -> 10459.79s]  Kill it!
[10459.79s -> 10484.40s]  I'm basing the opinion of bringing the fox up, not because I want to be the contrarian,
[10484.40s -> 10494.90s]  but because of that video of the fox going like, that's such a cute video, I love it.
[10503.70s -> 10512.62s]  It just keeps going.
[10512.62s -> 10523.29s]  What's up dog?
[10523.29s -> 10539.65s]  You just made like the lemur behind me laugh, I forgot to tell you guys I got a lemur.
[10539.77s -> 10551.84s]  Oh here's every single mukbang video you've ever watched in your entire life.
[10551.84s -> 10560.89s]  What about people that were in the Jerma Rumble?
[10560.89s -> 10574.73s]  I don't think I have the other stones.
[10574.73s -> 10591.91s]  Yes, yes I'll get the stones, I'll go after those stones, yes of course I'll get the stones.
[10592.15s -> 10603.78s]  Hello hello hello hello hello, oh no!
[10611.16s -> 10612.76s]  Jesus, oh my god!
[10612.76s -> 10615.16s]  Go to the workshop at the back and buy the streaming function!
[10623.70s -> 10628.74s]  Wait, let me take a guess, is thrumming like this like
[10628.74s -> 10647.29s]  Is that what it might be?
[10647.29s -> 10652.54s]  Your winner of this year's Worst Noise of the Year.
[10652.54s -> 10663.65s]  I've got it right here.
[10663.65s -> 10667.76s]  Oh wow this was close.
[10667.76s -> 10669.95s]  My god.
[10669.95s -> 10675.26s]  There was a 37 vote difference.
[10675.26s -> 10684.26s]  With 16.6% of the vote, it's the Spampton Request Accepted.
[10684.26s -> 10693.32s]  Right after that was the Cursed Mukbang, 16.6% and 16.3%.
[10693.32s -> 10699.34s]  Very far away was Saucon D's Nuts.
[10699.34s -> 10702.09s]  That was a 37 vote difference.
[10702.09s -> 10709.33s]  By the way, something funny to note about the best and worst noise category, some of
[10709.33s -> 10720.28s]  the most skipped, 1270 people skipped this question.
[10720.28s -> 10721.28s]  Which is a lot of people.
[10724.54s -> 10727.42s]  Alright, let's get back to the rumble.
[10727.42s -> 10732.22s]  Nooooooo you know what, fuck it.
[10732.22s -> 10736.49s]  We got, we'll do two more.
[10736.49s -> 10738.76s]  Two more categories.
[10738.76s -> 10739.76s]  Two more categories.
[10739.76s -> 10746.06s]  Yeah, a bunch of, I mean would you want to take that test?
[10746.06s -> 10752.18s]  I don't want to listen to like 25 of this annoying dude's sounds.
[10752.18s -> 10754.41s]  It makes perfect sense.
[10754.41s -> 10757.21s]  Alright, we will do two more.
[10757.21s -> 10762.58s]  Cause there's still, oh my god there's like 12 more categories holy shit.
[10762.58s -> 10768.60s]  All right, coming up next is a popular one, very popular.
[10768.60s -> 10775.42s]  This is best one guy moment of the year, if you don't know what a one guy moment is.
[10775.42s -> 10784.07s]  A one guy moment is when somebody in chat derails the stream to a point where we spend
[10784.07s -> 10789.04s]  about five to 10 plus minutes potentially, even maybe less, maybe more, dealing with
[10789.04s -> 10791.04s]  the fact that this person derailed the stream.
[10791.04s -> 10797.80s]  It's the best chat kind of, I guess, chat message, chat derailment.
[10797.80s -> 10802.16s]  It's the best one guy moment of the year.
[10802.16s -> 10804.18s]  And there was a lot of great categories this year.
[10804.18s -> 10805.18s]  Holy smokes.
[10805.18s -> 10810.13s]  We'll see them right now.
[10810.13s -> 10839.46s]  No, wait, I don't have a Rubik's Cube.
[10839.46s -> 10844.18s]  Guys, I have no fucking idea how to do a Rubik's Cube.
[10844.18s -> 10849.00s]  I have absolutely no idea.
[10849.00s -> 10852.76s]  I've only picked them up and just mushed them around in my hands for two minutes.
[10852.76s -> 10854.68s]  I don't even know how it works.
[10854.68s -> 10856.48s]  I don't understand how it works.
[10856.48s -> 10858.12s]  We're on times two speed.
[10858.12s -> 10882.16s]  Is that what you say next game?
[10882.16s -> 10891.99s]  Yeah, let me load up Yakuza.
[10891.99s -> 10897.07s]  I'm just telling you that I finally ate in and out the way that I was told I was supposed
[10897.07s -> 10899.87s]  to quote order special the burger.
[10899.87s -> 10905.77s]  And it was better than just ordering it off the menu, which makes me want to put it down
[10905.77s -> 10908.74s]  here.
[10908.74s -> 10913.90s]  Even the animal style dick, please apologize for typing me up for 10 minutes.
[10913.90s -> 10916.70s]  All right, so the pre stream chat, I timed somebody over 10 minutes.
[10916.70s -> 10917.70s]  But hold on.
[10918.42s -> 10920.98s]  Yes, I apologize for timing you out for 10 minutes in pre stream.
[10920.98s -> 10923.18s]  But let's talk about the context first.
[10923.18s -> 10925.94s]  You asked me to play Destiny 2 PVP tomorrow.
[10925.94s -> 10928.88s]  Do you think that is that it?
[10928.88s -> 10930.24s]  Should I have timed you up for an hour?
[10930.24s -> 10932.08s]  My little sister is afraid of you.
[10932.08s -> 10936.34s]  Why is your little sister watching this stream?
[10936.34s -> 10939.83s]  Does your little sister hate me now?
[10939.83s -> 10940.83s]  I've got somebody here.
[10940.83s -> 10942.77s]  Come on over here.
[10942.77s -> 10948.11s]  It's me, Elmo.
[10948.11s -> 10949.54s]  Hey, Elmo.
[10949.54s -> 10950.54s]  What are you doing here?
[10951.34s -> 10957.34s]  Well, I want to teach everybody some sharing and how to share your milk.
[10957.34s -> 10958.34s]  She's 24.
[10958.34s -> 10966.19s]  Press the button next to it.
[10966.19s -> 10967.19s]  She's 24.
[10967.19s -> 10977.90s]  She really does look like a GTA mod.
[10977.90s -> 10978.90s]  It still makes me laugh.
[10978.90s -> 10983.36s]  Flying Dutchman sucks so bad.
[10983.36s -> 10985.36s]  GTA mod.
[10985.36s -> 10986.36s]  I can't get over it.
[10986.36s -> 10987.36s]  Okay, perfect game.
[10987.36s -> 10988.36s]  Come on.
[10988.36s -> 10991.36s]  Please designate a corner of the screen for bird watching videos.
[10991.36s -> 10995.94s]  Well, this is it.
[10995.94s -> 10997.94s]  The fucking bird video is distracting me.
[10997.94s -> 11000.63s]  I keep looking at it.
[11000.63s -> 11002.63s]  I keep looking over here at these birds.
[11002.63s -> 11003.63s]  Hey, get out of there.
[11003.63s -> 11004.63s]  That's not yours.
[11004.63s -> 11006.63s]  That's not for you.
[11006.63s -> 11008.63s]  Stop eating the bird's bird seed.
[11008.63s -> 11014.12s]  I'm more interested.
[11014.12s -> 11017.40s]  Wait.
[11017.40s -> 11018.40s]  He's like, hey, get out of here.
[11018.40s -> 11020.96s]  This is our bird team.
[11020.96s -> 11025.96s]  My absolute favorite part of Harry Potter was Voldemort's strange sounds he would make.
[11025.96s -> 11037.01s]  Did somebody make a compilation?
[11037.01s -> 11042.48s]  It's over Simpson.
[11042.48s -> 11046.48s]  It's not over Simpson.
[11046.48s -> 11059.16s]  Jerma, I would rather see you in the hospital than on TikTok.
[11059.16s -> 11062.36s]  That's so fucked up.
[11062.36s -> 11063.86s]  Holy shit, dude.
[11063.86s -> 11064.86s]  What the fuck?
[11064.86s -> 11066.04s]  I'm just going to read this.
[11066.04s -> 11067.04s]  Had a dream last night.
[11067.04s -> 11072.21s]  Jerma became like a mainstream celebrity by pioneering a new type of stream.
[11072.21s -> 11074.21s]  He would play a game like normal.
[11074.21s -> 11081.21s]  But every once in a while, he'd let chat keep the horror and put this like red and black
[11081.21s -> 11083.21s]  pulsating mass on screen.
[11083.21s -> 11086.84s]  Kind of looked like an AI generated image.
[11086.84s -> 11091.84s]  And the whole deal was that everyone who saw it thought it was the funniest thing they'd
[11091.84s -> 11092.84s]  ever seen.
[11093.84s -> 11097.84s]  But every time he'd show it, one viewer who saw it would die.
[11097.84s -> 11102.40s]  It ended when he showed it on stream and dropped dead.
[11102.40s -> 11108.40s]  The stream was left on for 72 hours to honor his memory.
[11108.40s -> 11116.40s]  It was dead quiet with just his body and a slowly pulsating red mass on screen beside
[11116.40s -> 11119.04s]  him.
[11119.04s -> 11121.04s]  Stop pretending to be interested.
[11121.04s -> 11123.04s]  You're not going to play any of these games.
[11123.04s -> 11128.04s]  You'll be too busy playing like fart simulator 2013.
[11128.04s -> 11129.04s]  I gotta hide.
[11129.04s -> 11130.04s]  I gotta get out and hide.
[11130.04s -> 11132.04s]  I'm on the ground.
[11132.04s -> 11139.38s]  Is this the Union?
[11139.38s -> 11141.38s]  We've unionized.
[11141.38s -> 11143.81s]  Cigarette?
[11143.81s -> 11152.00s]  It's just a used, a done cigarette.
[11152.00s -> 11155.60s]  No, that's a banana.
[11155.60s -> 11156.60s]  That's a banana.
[11156.60s -> 11160.64s]  Relax.
[11160.64s -> 11164.64s]  When it gets to this face, however, the TV froze.
[11164.64s -> 11170.81s]  So I tried turning it on and off to restart it, but the TV just won't turn off.
[11170.81s -> 11173.81s]  And it's stuck on this fucked up image of Jerma's face.
[11173.81s -> 11176.05s]  Okay, I don't know how that happened.
[11176.05s -> 11181.42s]  A couple hours pass, and I don't know why it took me a while, but I finally decide to
[11181.42s -> 11183.42s]  unplug the TV.
[11183.42s -> 11187.42s]  And then I realized that the face is permanently burned onto the screen.
[11187.42s -> 11189.42s]  Like it's just stuck there.
[11189.42s -> 11192.42s]  My parents aren't back until later in the night.
[11192.42s -> 11197.60s]  So now I'm freaking out trying to cover the screen so that they don't see the stupid
[11197.60s -> 11200.60s]  face burned onto their thousand dollar TV.
[11200.60s -> 11209.21s]  What do I do?
[11209.21s -> 11213.24s]  If only it was real.
[11213.24s -> 11223.74s]  Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the best one guy moment of the year.
[11223.74s -> 11226.56s]  Oh, there are a lot of good ones too.
[11226.56s -> 11230.50s]  There were a lot of good ones.
[11236.22s -> 11244.16s]  With 27% of the vote, Peep the Horror.
[11244.16s -> 11248.61s]  Peep the Horror is your winner at 27%.
[11248.61s -> 11254.11s]  Jigsaw's Rubik's Cube at 17.6%.
[11254.11s -> 11262.35s]  And then right below it is the weird face burn-in at 17.3.
[11262.35s -> 11266.78s]  There was a 45 vote difference between 2 and 3.
[11266.78s -> 11270.04s]  They're all winners to me.
[11270.04s -> 11277.20s]  These are all winners to me.
[11277.20s -> 11280.20s]  The Rubik's Cube, that was some of the funniest shit I've ever seen in my life.
[11280.20s -> 11283.50s]  The burn-in shit was some of the funniest shit.
[11283.50s -> 11287.80s]  I will tell you right now, I know that people say this about their communities.
[11287.80s -> 11289.80s]  They say, oh man, my community is so funny.
[11289.80s -> 11296.55s]  Some of you guys just come up with some of the most fucked up funny shit I've ever heard of.
[11296.55s -> 11300.55s]  And it is an honor to be able to see it and laugh at it.
[11300.55s -> 11303.81s]  So let me just be clear about that.
[11303.81s -> 11306.81s]  We will do the rest of these in a little bit.
[11306.81s -> 11308.81s]  We'll go back to the rumble.
[11308.81s -> 11311.18s]  There are a few more matches to do.
[11311.18s -> 11314.15s]  Hopefully it doesn't crash.
[11314.15s -> 11316.15s]  Hopefully you can hear it.
[11316.15s -> 11322.84s]  Yeah, it's so hard to pick between what the community jokes that you guys make.
[11322.84s -> 11328.77s]  It's genuinely funny shit.
[11328.77s -> 11330.77s]  Let's do a couple more matches in the rumble.
[11330.77s -> 11332.65s]  Well, not the rumble.
[11332.65s -> 11333.65s]  The rumble's not till later.
[11333.65s -> 11334.65s]  We're not there yet.
[11334.65s -> 11336.85s]  Let us peep the horror.
[11336.85s -> 11337.85s]  Peep the Horror wins.
[11337.85s -> 11342.36s]  That's just such an insane concept to me.
[11342.36s -> 11348.99s]  What a wild thing to come up with.
[11348.99s -> 11350.99s]  Is this going to be a 7-hour stream?
[11350.99s -> 11354.99s]  We'll definitely do the Pacific countdown.
[11354.99s -> 11359.49s]  But I don't know how much longer after that.
[11359.49s -> 11360.49s]  I'm having a great time.
[11360.49s -> 11361.49s]  This is a fucking blast.
[11361.49s -> 11365.25s]  Hopefully you're having fun, too.
[11365.25s -> 11369.48s]  Let us continue with the rumble.
[11369.48s -> 11373.97s]  We have, I think, three more matches to do in the Germania card.
[11373.97s -> 11375.97s]  Oh, God.
[11375.97s -> 11376.97s]  Fuck this match.
[11376.97s -> 11378.98s]  Okay.
[11378.98s -> 11379.98s]  This is a ladder match.
[11379.98s -> 11382.98s]  This is a six-man ladder match.
[11382.98s -> 11388.93s]  This could go on for a very long time.
[11388.93s -> 11390.93s]  I hope it does not last that long.
[11390.93s -> 11397.01s]  Remember, tell me I'm funny now.
[11397.01s -> 11398.01s]  You're probably funny.
[11398.01s -> 11403.35s]  I don't know.
[11403.35s -> 11404.35s]  Is it mountain time in 30 minutes?
[11404.35s -> 11405.65s]  Yeah.
[11405.65s -> 11406.65s]  25 minutes.
[11406.65s -> 11411.48s]  30 minutes.
[11411.48s -> 11412.48s]  There were so many characters.
[11412.48s -> 11413.48s]  I had to just...
[11413.48s -> 11419.28s]  We had to do so many matches because you can only do 30 people in a rumble.
[11419.28s -> 11425.88s]  Almost all of the people in the rumble are people that you haven't seen yet.
[11425.88s -> 11428.88s]  I was like, damn, we have fucking 60 characters.
[11428.88s -> 11430.88s]  We have to put them in somewhere.
[11430.88s -> 11433.89s]  And this is where we put them in.
[11433.89s -> 11436.90s]  So without further ado, we got another match here.
[11436.90s -> 11437.90s]  We got a ladder match.
[11437.90s -> 11443.34s]  Six-man ladder match.
[11443.34s -> 11447.97s]  Here we go.
[11447.97s -> 11454.95s]  There were so many characters.
[11454.95s -> 11458.95s]  This is a ladder match, which means you have to climb to the top of the ladder,
[11458.95s -> 11464.57s]  grab the money in the bank, and this is between Rathu Flush,
[11464.57s -> 11471.80s]  of course, from the Flush family, the Sims family.
[11471.80s -> 11475.55s]  Here's Rathu Flush.
[11475.55s -> 11480.41s]  Quite a few Flushes.
[11480.41s -> 11490.91s]  Nice bugeyes, yeah.
[11490.91s -> 11495.96s]  There's Rathu Flush.
[11495.96s -> 11500.96s]  Who could possibly come in next?
[11500.96s -> 11509.10s]  I wonder if it's anybody else in the Flush family.
[11509.10s -> 11512.10s]  It could be the entire Flush family.
[11512.10s -> 11514.04s]  Could be.
[11514.04s -> 11516.04s]  Of course, that's Grunty Flush.
[11516.04s -> 11524.36s]  Where did he just go?
[11524.36s -> 11527.10s]  Never give up.
[11527.10s -> 11528.53s]  Okay.
[11528.53s -> 11529.53s]  Thanks, Grunty.
[11529.53s -> 11532.80s]  That's good advice.
[11532.80s -> 11545.58s]  Don't ever give up.
[11545.58s -> 11547.58s]  Grunty Flush, Rathu Flush.
[11547.58s -> 11553.47s]  You probably see where this is going.
[11553.47s -> 11562.24s]  There's Ratchet Flush.
[11562.24s -> 11579.22s]  Yeah, they're all 220 pounds.
[11579.22s -> 11585.51s]  It's to make sure nobody has an advantage in the actual matches.
[11585.51s -> 11588.81s]  Some are actually, they weigh a lot less.
[11588.81s -> 11597.36s]  Any other Flush family members we should be aware of?
[11597.36s -> 11604.12s]  Oh my God, that's Strong Henry Flush.
[11604.12s -> 11608.62s]  He was nominated Top Character of the Year.
[11608.62s -> 11612.12s]  I hope he dies in this match.
[11612.12s -> 11621.05s]  I hope somebody breaks his neck in this match.
[11630.87s -> 11632.87s]  Alright, fuck this guy. Let's go.
[11632.87s -> 11649.74s]  Who could forget Bumpy Flush?
[11649.74s -> 11650.74s]  The cat.
[11650.74s -> 11653.17s]  This just burped so loud.
[11653.17s -> 11657.69s]  This is the character I dropped the meteor on.
[11657.69s -> 11661.70s]  I dropped a meteor on Bumpy Flush accidentally.
[11661.70s -> 11676.04s]  Not on purpose, accidentally.
[11676.04s -> 11680.62s]  And finally, who could forget Sus Flush?
[11680.62s -> 11685.10s]  Or the sus guy?
[11685.10s -> 11687.53s]  Either one, who cares.
[11687.53s -> 11688.53s]  It doesn't matter.
[11688.53s -> 11690.53s]  Sus Flush.
[11690.53s -> 11702.36s]  I hope this does not go 40 goddamn minutes.
[11702.36s -> 11704.36s]  I'm hoping this is over in 10 minutes.
[11704.36s -> 11707.22s]  That would be ideal.
[11707.22s -> 11714.86s]  That'd be great.
[11714.86s -> 11718.86s]  Here we go, the six man ladder match between the sus family.
[11718.86s -> 11720.86s]  That's not them.
[11720.86s -> 11724.00s]  It's the Flush family.
[11724.00s -> 11730.00s]  Sus Flush, Grunty Flush, Ratchet Flush, Rathew Flush, Strong Henry Flush, Bumpy Flush.
[11730.00s -> 11733.52s]  Here they go.
[11733.52s -> 11736.52s]  The only way you can win this match if you climb to the top of the ladder,
[11736.52s -> 11739.52s]  grab that money in the bag briefcase.
[11739.52s -> 11742.40s]  The sus dynasty.
[11742.40s -> 11746.79s]  Already we have a few problems.
[11746.79s -> 11748.79s]  Sus Flush going after Strong Henry.
[11748.79s -> 11752.35s]  Gets double dropkick for his trouble.
[11752.35s -> 11756.23s]  No, you can't predict all four.
[11756.23s -> 11757.23s]  No, you can't.
[11757.23s -> 11763.90s]  This is from that dogshit Sims game I did.
[11763.90s -> 11769.23s]  Grunty, going for the ladder immediately.
[11769.23s -> 11770.23s]  Oh my goodness.
[11770.23s -> 11773.66s]  Bumpy Flush with a belly to back suplex.
[11773.66s -> 11777.84s]  I don't think they'll ever be a winner of this match.
[11777.84s -> 11778.84s]  I have to be honest.
[11778.84s -> 11784.56s]  This is shit mid card serpent bullshit.
[11784.56s -> 11788.72s]  Fuck.
[11788.72s -> 11795.58s]  Just be happy there's not six serpents for the love of God.
[11795.58s -> 11801.04s]  It's the entire slush family for God's sake.
[11801.04s -> 11810.36s]  Whatever the dumb name is, who cares?
[11810.36s -> 11814.00s]  I don't even know the names.
[11814.00s -> 11816.00s]  Bumpy is the cat.
[11816.00s -> 11819.00s]  Sus is that guy, me right there.
[11819.00s -> 11820.00s]  I think that's Rathew.
[11820.00s -> 11823.00s]  Is Rathew going to take it right now?
[11823.00s -> 11824.00s]  No, no, no.
[11824.00s -> 11825.00s]  Going up.
[11825.00s -> 11826.00s]  He could get it right now.
[11826.00s -> 11829.48s]  Rathew going for the belt right now.
[11829.48s -> 11833.90s]  Why is he giving me indicators?
[11833.90s -> 11834.90s]  I'm not playing.
[11834.90s -> 11839.00s]  I swear to God.
[11839.00s -> 11841.00s]  Oh, and down goes Rathew Flush.
[11841.00s -> 11844.00s]  Ratchet Flush has got the briefcase.
[11844.00s -> 11846.00s]  There's no way he gets it right now.
[11846.00s -> 11848.00s]  No way.
[11848.00s -> 11851.56s]  No way.
[11851.56s -> 11853.56s]  Somebody stop him.
[11853.56s -> 11854.56s]  Stop him right now.
[11854.56s -> 11855.56s]  Grunty.
[11855.56s -> 11859.56s]  Stop there and stop him from playing his weird minigame.
[11859.56s -> 11865.39s]  Thank goodness Grunty with a couple of abdomen punches.
[11865.39s -> 11867.39s]  I think Ratchet is through.
[11867.39s -> 11872.96s]  I don't know why the indicators are on screen.
[11872.96s -> 11874.96s]  I swear to God.
[11874.96s -> 11881.36s]  It's a fake match.
[11881.36s -> 11885.30s]  Now Sus Flush has the ladder.
[11885.30s -> 11887.92s]  Thinking about going up himself maybe.
[11887.92s -> 11888.92s]  No, strong Henry.
[11888.92s -> 11891.93s]  Voted best character of the year.
[11891.93s -> 11893.93s]  Going to show why it seems like.
[11893.93s -> 11895.93s]  No, no, no, no, Sus Flush.
[11895.93s -> 11898.30s]  A couple of elbows into his head.
[11898.30s -> 11901.12s]  There he goes over the top ropes.
[11901.12s -> 11905.12s]  Pumpy Flush gets a double dropkick and Ratchet Flush picks up.
[11905.12s -> 11908.12s]  No, he gets killed by strong Henry Flush.
[11908.12s -> 11912.57s]  No one's ever going to get this ladder up.
[11912.57s -> 11915.88s]  It's not going to happen.
[11915.88s -> 11918.83s]  I may as well skip this match.
[11918.83s -> 11924.83s]  Because there's not a chance in hell that this ladder goes up and somebody climbs it.
[11924.83s -> 11934.16s]  Prove I'm not cheating.
[11934.16s -> 11940.71s]  See?
[11940.71s -> 11948.08s]  Pumpy Flush takes a backhand to the back of the back by Sus Flush.
[11948.08s -> 11950.08s]  I'm actually, I wonder who wins this.
[11950.08s -> 11953.08s]  I have no idea who could possibly win this.
[11953.08s -> 11956.16s]  They all have such shit stats too.
[11956.16s -> 11959.48s]  I made sure of it.
[11959.48s -> 11962.48s]  As Sus Flush, I can't, indeed it's hard to say that after a bottle of champagne.
[11962.48s -> 11965.24s]  Give me a break.
[11965.24s -> 11968.60s]  Rathew Flush takes Ratchet Flush.
[11968.60s -> 11970.60s]  From the top turnbuckle in Grunty now.
[11970.60s -> 11972.60s]  Resting on the side here.
[11972.60s -> 11979.26s]  No one's going to win.
[11979.26s -> 11982.78s]  As Rathew and Ratchet are on the top rope.
[11982.78s -> 11984.78s]  Big suplex incoming, here it goes.
[11984.78s -> 11986.78s]  On his back, onto the ladder potentially.
[11986.78s -> 11987.78s]  Oh, there it is.
[11987.78s -> 11988.78s]  Huge.
[11988.78s -> 11994.84s]  Big pain there on Ratchet Flush.
[11994.84s -> 12004.74s]  Wait, why did that ladder fall?
[12004.74s -> 12006.74s]  As Bumpy grabs the ladder.
[12006.74s -> 12014.14s]  Oh no, Bumpy now going to maybe think about going to the top.
[12014.14s -> 12015.14s]  I think it's going to happen here.
[12015.14s -> 12018.14s]  Bumpy thinking about climbing that ladder to grab the money in the bank.
[12018.14s -> 12020.14s]  Is it possible?
[12020.14s -> 12023.62s]  Sus Flush is going to, no, has something to say about it.
[12023.62s -> 12024.62s]  A strong Henry.
[12024.62s -> 12029.08s]  Does anyone care about a single character in this match?
[12029.08s -> 12031.02s]  I don't.
[12031.02s -> 12036.16s]  A meteor could hit the arena right now.
[12036.16s -> 12039.46s]  And kill everybody in the ring.
[12039.46s -> 12040.46s]  And I would not care.
[12040.46s -> 12045.85s]  As strong Henry Flush takes the ladder away from Bumpy Flush.
[12045.85s -> 12047.86s]  Setting it up.
[12047.86s -> 12048.86s]  Trying to get to the top.
[12048.86s -> 12049.86s]  No!
[12049.86s -> 12051.86s]  Closing it down.
[12051.86s -> 12056.32s]  Setting it up again.
[12056.32s -> 12058.32s]  And not climbing it for some reason.
[12058.32s -> 12061.76s]  I think the fan favorite might be Bumpy Flush.
[12061.76s -> 12064.21s]  Nope.
[12064.21s -> 12066.39s]  Going to close it up again.
[12066.39s -> 12067.39s]  Nope.
[12067.39s -> 12068.39s]  Going to open it again.
[12068.39s -> 12070.39s]  I don't think it's in the right spot.
[12070.39s -> 12071.39s]  Strong Henry.
[12071.39s -> 12074.04s]  No, no.
[12074.04s -> 12076.04s]  You can't get it from there.
[12076.04s -> 12077.04s]  And I have to move it.
[12077.04s -> 12079.60s]  You're going to have to move it.
[12079.60s -> 12080.60s]  Yep.
[12080.60s -> 12081.60s]  There it is.
[12081.60s -> 12082.60s]  Okay.
[12082.60s -> 12083.60s]  Thank you.
[12083.60s -> 12086.69s]  Move it.
[12086.69s -> 12087.69s]  Just, okay.
[12087.69s -> 12092.07s]  Doesn't care.
[12092.07s -> 12093.07s]  Doesn't seem to mind.
[12093.07s -> 12094.07s]  Bumpy the Betrayer.
[12094.07s -> 12095.07s]  As Grunty has Sus on the ground.
[12095.07s -> 12097.37s]  Look at the kicks to the sternum.
[12097.37s -> 12101.49s]  Eye rake.
[12101.49s -> 12104.59s]  No, throwing him outside.
[12104.59s -> 12106.59s]  What is Ratchet doing up there?
[12106.59s -> 12111.64s]  I think strong, no, no, no.
[12111.64s -> 12112.64s]  Ratchet's going to go to the outside.
[12112.64s -> 12113.64s]  What are you?
[12113.64s -> 12115.64s]  Why would you do that?
[12115.64s -> 12121.70s]  Go into the ring where Strong Henry has got the money in the bank right now.
[12121.70s -> 12122.70s]  He's got it.
[12122.70s -> 12125.13s]  Let's see if he does this little weird puzzle.
[12125.13s -> 12127.13s]  Don't think so.
[12127.13s -> 12131.59s]  As Grunty and Strong Henry flush.
[12131.59s -> 12133.59s]  I don't know their names.
[12133.59s -> 12136.59s]  I killed them all in one day in Sims.
[12136.59s -> 12137.96s]  I don't give a shit.
[12137.96s -> 12139.96s]  I don't care if any of these guys die.
[12139.96s -> 12145.60s]  They could live or die and I don't care.
[12145.60s -> 12149.11s]  Strong Henry?
[12149.11s -> 12150.11s]  Bumpy Henry?
[12150.11s -> 12151.11s]  I don't know their names.
[12151.11s -> 12154.88s]  You guys all want the Sus guy to win anyways.
[12154.88s -> 12155.88s]  He's going up there right now.
[12155.88s -> 12158.88s]  And as the Sus guy reaches the top of the money in the bank.
[12158.88s -> 12161.12s]  Will Sus Flush win?
[12161.12s -> 12165.68s]  And win as best?
[12165.68s -> 12166.68s]  Flush?
[12166.68s -> 12167.68s]  Shit?
[12167.68s -> 12168.68s]  Dumb fucking loser family?
[12168.68s -> 12169.68s]  I don't know.
[12169.68s -> 12171.63s]  No.
[12171.63s -> 12172.63s]  Will he take it?
[12172.63s -> 12174.63s]  No, he will not.
[12174.63s -> 12179.11s]  That was so stupid.
[12179.11s -> 12182.56s]  Out goes Ratty Flush.
[12182.56s -> 12184.56s]  Strong Henry got Sus Flush by the neck.
[12184.56s -> 12185.56s]  Flipping up into the back.
[12185.56s -> 12186.56s]  And...
[12186.56s -> 12187.56s]  Whoa!
[12187.56s -> 12191.57s]  Make noises because you can't do commentary anymore.
[12191.57s -> 12195.48s]  As Bumpy Flush taking the ladder.
[12195.48s -> 12198.48s]  I think Bumpy might get it here.
[12198.48s -> 12199.91s]  Everybody's distracted.
[12199.91s -> 12200.91s]  Not in a great place.
[12200.91s -> 12204.91s]  But Bumpy is unhatching the latch on the money in the bank.
[12204.91s -> 12206.91s]  Will Bumpy Flush take it?
[12206.91s -> 12209.91s]  Ratchet and Strong Henry have something to say.
[12209.91s -> 12211.34s]  No.
[12211.34s -> 12215.87s]  No.
[12215.87s -> 12226.32s]  As Grunty throws Bumpy out of...
[12226.32s -> 12228.32s]  I don't even know their names.
[12228.32s -> 12229.32s]  I'm going to be honest.
[12229.32s -> 12234.95s]  As Green Guy takes Elf Guy and throws Green Guy out of the ring.
[12234.95s -> 12241.49s]  We've only got two left in the ring as Ratchet and Rathew.
[12241.49s -> 12245.37s]  I think Rathew has a good opportunity here.
[12245.37s -> 12247.68s]  To set the ladder up in the middle of the ring.
[12247.68s -> 12248.68s]  Looks like he does.
[12248.68s -> 12253.67s]  As Grunty rolls in.
[12253.67s -> 12261.86s]  Can somebody throw a grenade into the ring?
[12261.86s -> 12266.75s]  Can somebody throw a grenade?
[12266.75s -> 12278.12s]  As Bumpy Flush gets to the top of the ladder.
[12278.12s -> 12280.74s]  Grabbing the briefcase.
[12280.74s -> 12281.74s]  Will Bumpy...
[12281.74s -> 12284.75s]  What are you doing, you idiot?
[12284.75s -> 12286.75s]  Just grab it for God's sake.
[12286.75s -> 12289.08s]  Bumpy!
[12289.08s -> 12290.32s]  Two right hands.
[12290.32s -> 12291.32s]  Three right hands.
[12291.32s -> 12292.32s]  Raking home.
[12292.32s -> 12299.76s]  This is never going to end.
[12299.76s -> 12300.76s]  Alright.
[12300.76s -> 12304.67s]  Ratchet set it up and get the damn money.
[12304.67s -> 12306.67s]  Ratchet, Flush getting the ladder set up.
[12306.67s -> 12311.25s]  As Bumpy is not happy about it.
[12311.25s -> 12315.25s]  Six man ladder may have been not a great idea.
[12315.25s -> 12317.75s]  I will say.
[12317.75s -> 12320.12s]  Although Ratchet going up there now.
[12320.12s -> 12325.00s]  Not going to be able to do it as Sus Flush takes it.
[12325.00s -> 12327.32s]  Nope.
[12327.32s -> 12328.32s]  What?
[12328.32s -> 12332.48s]  That's Rathew?
[12332.48s -> 12344.18s]  Who cares?
[12344.18s -> 12352.92s]  As Bumpy Flush, I think Bumpy is the favorite.
[12352.92s -> 12357.70s]  Sus Flush over the top ropes by Rathew.
[12357.70s -> 12362.07s]  We've got Strong, we've got Grunty, we've got Rathew in the ring right now.
[12362.07s -> 12366.08s]  Who will set the ladder up and who will actually win this?
[12366.08s -> 12368.08s]  Grunty got the ladder now going in the middle of the ring.
[12368.08s -> 12372.07s]  Thinking about climbing the ropes.
[12372.07s -> 12373.24s]  No, don't you...
[12373.24s -> 12374.24s]  Oh my God.
[12374.24s -> 12375.24s]  What are you doing?
[12375.24s -> 12379.24s]  Grunty outside.
[12379.24s -> 12381.24s]  Why would you throw Bumpy back in the ring?
[12381.24s -> 12382.73s]  You don't want to put people...
[12382.73s -> 12384.73s]  You want to climb the ladder.
[12384.73s -> 12385.73s]  You don't want to put people back in the ring.
[12385.73s -> 12387.73s]  Get up there.
[12387.73s -> 12390.73s]  Grunty is thinking about winning here.
[12390.73s -> 12392.73s]  Will we see a victory?
[12392.73s -> 12393.73s]  I don't think so.
[12393.73s -> 12395.73s]  There are too many people.
[12395.73s -> 12398.73s]  The AI will always knock you down unless...
[12398.73s -> 12399.73s]  I guess not.
[12399.73s -> 12402.29s]  I don't know.
[12402.29s -> 12412.66s]  Bumpy, get up there and win, please.
[12412.66s -> 12414.48s]  Bumpy, I got a show to run.
[12414.48s -> 12415.48s]  You got to get up there.
[12415.48s -> 12417.48s]  Come on, Bumpy.
[12417.48s -> 12421.74s]  Bumpy, I got a show to move on with, so get up there.
[12421.74s -> 12424.74s]  Bumpy Flush the cat, the meatier cat that you all love.
[12424.74s -> 12428.92s]  And Ratchet Flush fighting now for the briefcase.
[12428.92s -> 12429.92s]  Who will get the briefcase?
[12429.92s -> 12430.92s]  I wonder what's it going to be?
[12430.92s -> 12431.92s]  Punch in the face to Bumpy.
[12431.92s -> 12433.92s]  Bumpy takes another right hand.
[12433.92s -> 12434.92s]  Two more.
[12434.92s -> 12437.09s]  Will Bumpy go down in a strong...
[12437.09s -> 12439.09s]  AI push over ladder.
[12439.09s -> 12442.09s]  AI, I fucking moron.
[12442.09s -> 12443.33s]  You get off.
[12443.33s -> 12444.64s]  Okay.
[12444.64s -> 12447.64s]  Now I push you over top rope and Bumpy win.
[12447.64s -> 12450.96s]  Bumpy's got it.
[12450.96s -> 12454.84s]  Bumpy's got the briefcase.
[12454.84s -> 12470.61s]  Someone set it up, please.
[12470.61s -> 12472.92s]  Lord, use the ladder as a weapon.
[12472.92s -> 12478.59s]  Stop just trying to climb it, you idiots.
[12478.59s -> 12480.59s]  Call the firing squad.
[12480.59s -> 12491.53s]  Grunty's finishing him.
[12491.53s -> 12495.24s]  Call an air strike him.
[12495.24s -> 12498.64s]  All right, Ratchet's going up now.
[12498.64s -> 12500.64s]  Finally, Ratchet's going to get the band.
[12500.64s -> 12501.64s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[12501.64s -> 12503.64s]  Bumpy's underneath there.
[12503.64s -> 12508.24s]  I have no idea who wins this.
[12508.24s -> 12512.58s]  No idea.
[12512.58s -> 12524.04s]  I think Ratchet's got it.
[12524.04s -> 12528.90s]  It's never going to end.
[12528.90s -> 12530.90s]  It's never going to end.
[12530.90s -> 12532.90s]  I think I have to intervene.
[12532.90s -> 12533.90s]  It's not going to end.
[12533.90s -> 12537.84s]  I have to intervene because I don't think it's going to end.
[12537.84s -> 12544.60s]  As Grunty sets the ladder up, it's Bumpy now.
[12544.60s -> 12546.60s]  Outside the ring, Grunty go.
[12546.60s -> 12549.42s]  Go, get it.
[12549.42s -> 12550.42s]  Complete it.
[12550.42s -> 12551.42s]  End it.
[12551.42s -> 12554.85s]  As Grunty, no, Strong Henry has something to say about it.
[12554.85s -> 12557.85s]  Potentially, no.
[12557.85s -> 12559.85s]  I don't think so.
[12559.85s -> 12563.03s]  Might get up there in a fast enough time.
[12563.03s -> 12566.03s]  And there goes Grunty falling back down.
[12566.03s -> 12569.03s]  No, stop pushing the ladder over you dickheads.
[12569.03s -> 12571.03s]  Oh, my God.
[12571.03s -> 12579.03s]  Someone please win.
[12579.03s -> 12582.68s]  This is so sus.
[12582.68s -> 12584.17s]  Okay.
[12584.17s -> 12591.38s]  Throw dice in the air to find out who wins.
[12591.38s -> 12594.18s]  Because I don't know.
[12594.18s -> 12597.06s]  Oh, Matthew.
[12597.06s -> 12598.68s]  Stop.
[12598.68s -> 12600.05s]  Walk.
[12600.05s -> 12602.93s]  You're having a lot of trouble right now.
[12602.93s -> 12605.49s]  You're having a lot of trouble.
[12605.49s -> 12608.49s]  I wish you would end it, but you just won't.
[12608.49s -> 12611.50s]  Yeah, okay.
[12611.50s -> 12614.38s]  You could grab the ladder and set it up.
[12614.38s -> 12616.38s]  Maybe climb up there and grab the bunny in the bank
[12616.38s -> 12619.38s]  and we could do the next few awards.
[12619.38s -> 12621.38s]  Or you could just get...
[12621.38s -> 12624.32s]  Okay.
[12624.32s -> 12632.17s]  There are other weapons they could use, too.
[12632.17s -> 12636.01s]  Someone said, this is awesome.
[12636.01s -> 12637.01s]  All right.
[12637.01s -> 12640.66s]  Wait.
[12640.66s -> 12646.87s]  Strong Henry Flush going to the top,
[12646.87s -> 12648.87s]  trying to grab the money in the bank.
[12648.87s -> 12649.87s]  Will he get it?
[12649.87s -> 12652.80s]  He's got his hands on it.
[12652.80s -> 12653.80s]  He's got his hands on it.
[12653.80s -> 12655.04s]  He got it.
[12655.04s -> 12656.04s]  He got it.
[12656.04s -> 12658.04s]  Strong Henry Flush is your winner.
[12658.04s -> 12661.62s]  Didn't win best character of the year,
[12661.62s -> 12665.62s]  but won in this match.
[12665.62s -> 12667.62s]  Congratulations, Strong Henry Flush.
[12667.62s -> 12668.62s]  Man, what an upset.
[12668.62s -> 12672.74s]  It could have been Matthew.
[12672.74s -> 12674.74s]  It could have been Ratchet two times.
[12674.74s -> 12683.40s]  This is what we call delete six characters from the Rumble.
[12683.40s -> 12687.96s]  Because there's like 30 new characters you haven't seen in the Rumble.
[12687.96s -> 12692.51s]  Okay.
[12692.51s -> 12693.51s]  Let's go to the next one.
[12693.51s -> 12694.51s]  Why not?
[12694.51s -> 12699.33s]  Let's go.
[12699.33s -> 12700.33s]  We got so many more categories.
[12700.33s -> 12701.33s]  There's so many more.
[12701.33s -> 12702.33s]  Oh, this one's going to be big.
[12702.33s -> 12705.96s]  This is a Tornado Tag Steel Cage match.
[12705.96s -> 12708.96s]  And I am very interested in this one.
[12708.96s -> 12710.26s]  I'm locked in.
[12710.26s -> 12712.26s]  I'm laser focused on this one.
[12712.26s -> 12718.36s]  New Year coming up for Mountain Central.
[12718.36s -> 12719.36s]  What is it?
[12719.36s -> 12722.08s]  Mountain Time?
[12722.08s -> 12723.70s]  Mountain Time?
[12723.70s -> 12724.70s]  We'll get them all.
[12724.70s -> 12727.80s]  Fuck it.
[12727.80s -> 12728.80s]  Let's go.
[12728.80s -> 12734.96s]  Can you punish Rathew?
[12734.96s -> 12735.96s]  He's already punished he exists.
[12735.96s -> 12736.96s]  There are 30,000 people here right now.
[12736.96s -> 12740.00s]  My God.
[12740.00s -> 12743.22s]  All right.
[12743.22s -> 12744.22s]  Tornado Tag Steel Cage.
[12744.22s -> 12746.22s]  This is a food related match.
[12746.22s -> 12752.09s]  Should we wait till the New Year for Mountain?
[12752.09s -> 12757.47s]  There are only two matches after this.
[12757.47s -> 12758.47s]  We're getting close.
[12758.47s -> 12760.47s]  We're like another hour or two out.
[12760.47s -> 12763.24s]  I'll wait.
[12763.24s -> 12764.24s]  All right.
[12764.24s -> 12769.45s]  Let's wait.
[12769.45s -> 12770.45s]  Let's wait.
[12770.45s -> 12771.45s]  Let's wait.
[12771.45s -> 12779.86s]  So this is for Mountain Time coming up here.
[12779.86s -> 12780.86s]  Nobody lives in Mountain Time.
[12780.86s -> 12785.49s]  Lots of people live in Mountain Time.
[12785.49s -> 12786.49s]  Come on.
[12786.49s -> 12788.69s]  Here we go.
[12788.69s -> 12795.22s]  Two minutes till New Year's Mountain Time.
[12795.22s -> 12799.72s]  It's just a mountain.
[12799.72s -> 12802.44s]  What is Mountain?
[12802.44s -> 12804.44s]  What states are in Mountain Time?
[12804.44s -> 12812.20s]  Arizona?
[12812.20s -> 12817.35s]  Colorado?
[12817.35s -> 12822.28s]  Oh, who fucking cares about Mountain Time?
[12822.28s -> 12824.16s]  Fuck it.
[12825.16s -> 12828.16s]  Midnight in Mountain Time.
[12828.16s -> 12837.97s]  And all the 1200 people that live in Mountain Time.
[12837.97s -> 12839.97s]  Happy New Year to Mountain Time.
[12839.97s -> 12844.22s]  I'm kidding.
[12844.22s -> 12845.22s]  We'll wait.
[12845.22s -> 12846.22s]  Just wait.
[12846.22s -> 12858.28s]  One minute.
[12858.28s -> 12862.67s]  And then we got we got Pacific right after in less than an hour.
[12862.67s -> 12870.24s]  Bunch of what?
[12870.24s -> 12875.92s]  I'm on like a fucking McDonald's double cheeseburger right now.
[12875.92s -> 12876.92s]  So bad.
[12876.92s -> 12880.65s]  All right.
[12880.65s -> 12882.65s]  30 seconds until Mountain Time New Year's.
[12882.65s -> 12883.65s]  Let's count it down.
[12883.65s -> 12886.62s]  Let's get it.
[12886.62s -> 12887.62s]  You skipped Central?
[12887.62s -> 12888.62s]  No, I didn't.
[12888.62s -> 12891.72s]  We did Central.
[12891.72s -> 12894.11s]  Here we go.
[12894.11s -> 12896.05s]  All you Mountainers.
[12896.05s -> 12897.05s]  Ten seconds.
[12897.05s -> 12899.38s]  Ten.
[12899.38s -> 12900.38s]  Nine.
[12900.38s -> 12901.80s]  Eight.
[12901.80s -> 12902.80s]  Seven.
[12902.80s -> 12903.80s]  Six.
[12903.80s -> 12904.80s]  Five.
[12904.80s -> 12905.80s]  Four.
[12905.80s -> 12906.80s]  Three.
[12906.80s -> 12907.80s]  Two.
[12907.80s -> 12911.55s]  Happy New Year Mountain Time.
[12911.55s -> 12944.09s]  The next match coming up here is a big one.
[12944.09s -> 12946.97s]  Food related like I said before.
[12946.97s -> 12952.58s]  Let me make sure this is on the screen so you can see it.
[12952.58s -> 12953.58s]  Oh!
[12953.58s -> 12954.58s]  Link!
[12954.58s -> 12955.82s]  Fuck it.
[12955.82s -> 12959.04s]  Who cares?
[12959.04s -> 12969.18s]  Who gives a shit?
[12969.18s -> 12970.18s]  Oh, that was Gordon Ramsay.
[12970.18s -> 12974.25s]  The guy that's going to get us all banned from Twitch.
[12974.25s -> 12979.48s]  The guy that's going to get all our channels shut down.
[12979.48s -> 12989.55s]  The Easy Bake Oven and Gordon Ramsay.
[12989.55s -> 12996.52s]  There's the Easy Bake Oven.
[12996.52s -> 12997.52s]  Nice one, Ron.
[12997.52s -> 13002.45s]  Was the Easy Bake Oven 2021?
[13002.45s -> 13005.45s]  No, but it made the most sense to pair with Gordon Ramsay.
[13005.45s -> 13017.44s]  This game sucks.
[13017.44s -> 13018.44s]  Play NFL.
[13018.44s -> 13020.44s]  No, we got Gordon Ramsay.
[13020.44s -> 13022.44s]  All the way from Hell's Kitchen.
[13022.44s -> 13023.44s]  California.
[13023.44s -> 13026.92s]  Las Vegas.
[13026.92s -> 13027.92s]  Wellington.
[13027.92s -> 13028.92s]  It's unbelievable.
[13028.92s -> 13032.76s]  Don't mess with the dough.
[13032.76s -> 13034.76s]  Don't send him a TikTok.
[13034.76s -> 13036.76s]  Showing you messing with his Wellington.
[13036.76s -> 13037.76s]  What are you doing to my Wellington?
[13037.76s -> 13038.76s]  Don't do that.
[13038.76s -> 13045.59s]  Going to get us all cancelled on Twitch.
[13045.59s -> 13055.76s]  This is a cage match, by the way.
[13055.76s -> 13063.75s]  They ain't getting out.
[13063.75s -> 13066.75s]  So Gordon Ramsay and the Easy Bake Oven versus the McRiddler.
[13066.75s -> 13072.44s]  Huge fast food fan.
[13072.44s -> 13075.00s]  Big into McDonald's.
[13075.00s -> 13076.00s]  Wendy's.
[13076.00s -> 13077.00s]  Burger King.
[13077.00s -> 13083.28s]  Big Burger King fan himself.
[13083.28s -> 13092.66s]  There's the McRiddler from Saints Row 2.
[13092.66s -> 13097.59s]  His partner is none other than...
[13097.59s -> 13098.59s]  You probably saw it.
[13098.59s -> 13099.59s]  I leaked it for a second.
[13099.59s -> 13102.40s]  But the point still stands.
[13102.40s -> 13104.90s]  That's the Burger King Long Chicken Sandwich.
[13104.90s -> 13112.68s]  That's the only thing you should order at Burger King.
[13112.68s -> 13115.37s]  Everything else at Burger King sucks.
[13115.37s -> 13116.37s]  Absolute asshole.
[13116.37s -> 13119.93s]  There's two menu items at Burger King that you should order.
[13119.93s -> 13121.93s]  This is one of them.
[13121.93s -> 13126.67s]  The other one is just their french fries.
[13126.67s -> 13129.97s]  Nothing else on that whole menu is good.
[13129.97s -> 13135.31s]  I'm not going to lie to you. I have to be real.
[13135.31s -> 13138.31s]  But the Long Chicken Burger King Sandwich,
[13138.31s -> 13139.31s]  and their french fries,
[13139.31s -> 13141.31s]  and their onion rings,
[13141.31s -> 13144.44s]  get them up to a C tier.
[13144.44s -> 13145.44s]  Or a B tier, at least.
[13145.44s -> 13154.04s]  The only way you win this match is if you escape the ring.
[13154.04s -> 13155.66s]  No pins.
[13155.66s -> 13159.48s]  No knockouts.
[13159.48s -> 13161.48s]  You gotta climb that cage and get out.
[13161.48s -> 13170.61s]  Close the cage down on our four combatants.
[13170.61s -> 13171.61s]  Let's see what happens.
[13171.61s -> 13172.61s]  Gordon Ramsay, Easy Bake Oven,
[13172.61s -> 13175.98s]  Long Chicken Sandwich, and the McRiddler.
[13175.98s -> 13177.98s]  Somebody has to get out.
[13177.98s -> 13188.61s]  You just have to escape.
[13188.61s -> 13193.99s]  I thought he threw him over the edge.
[13193.99s -> 13199.06s]  Long Chicken Sandwich is already going up there.
[13199.06s -> 13202.06s]  McRiddler and the Long Chicken are leaving already.
[13202.06s -> 13204.81s]  JKJ...
[13204.81s -> 13206.81s]  I'm getting indicators already.
[13206.81s -> 13212.46s]  I'm not playing the game as they're trying to both leave at the same time.
[13212.46s -> 13215.28s]  Gordon Ramsay not going to have that though.
[13215.28s -> 13216.28s]  Or the Easy Bake Oven.
[13216.28s -> 13221.24s]  One could say they're in a gigantic oven.
[13221.24s -> 13223.32s]  Closed.
[13223.32s -> 13226.63s]  Afraid.
[13226.63s -> 13230.58s]  Trying to get out of this oven.
[13230.58s -> 13234.23s]  Juan Gordo.
[13234.23s -> 13238.04s]  Yep, Gordon has a big advantage here.
[13238.04s -> 13244.35s]  The last week or two he's had over 430,000 concurrent viewers on Twitch.
[13244.35s -> 13246.35s]  He's got a lot of power behind him.
[13246.35s -> 13252.15s]  He's got a lot of momentum behind him.
[13252.15s -> 13255.45s]  Although I'm not really sure that can fight against the McRiddler.
[13255.45s -> 13259.40s]  Who had...
[13259.40s -> 13261.64s]  A month ago.
[13261.64s -> 13263.64s]  16,000 concurrent viewers.
[13263.64s -> 13264.64s]  That's pretty good.
[13264.64s -> 13265.64s]  That's pretty good.
[13265.64s -> 13266.64s]  That's pretty good.
[13266.64s -> 13268.96s]  Trying to get out.
[13268.96s -> 13272.84s]  Immediately can't get out.
[13272.84s -> 13275.49s]  Has the long...
[13275.49s -> 13276.49s]  No, Gordon now going out.
[13276.49s -> 13278.67s]  Trying to climb out.
[13278.67s -> 13281.67s]  Long Chicken Sandwich gets him by the foot.
[13281.67s -> 13284.67s]  Throws him into that rough steel cage.
[13284.67s -> 13287.67s]  There he goes in his Hell's Kitchen garb.
[13287.67s -> 13292.34s]  The McRiddler must be so sweaty.
[13292.34s -> 13299.12s]  The McChicken is too tall.
[13299.12s -> 13305.82s]  Up in the air, Hurricane Rana onto the Easy Bake oven.
[13305.82s -> 13307.82s]  20 community subs from Mr. Sark.
[13307.82s -> 13309.82s]  Mr. Sark, how the fuck are you?
[13309.82s -> 13311.51s]  Wait a minute.
[13311.51s -> 13315.75s]  We have two people on opposite teams trying to get out at the same time.
[13315.75s -> 13317.75s]  Will one of them get out?
[13317.75s -> 13319.75s]  They have free reign.
[13319.75s -> 13321.75s]  Who can climb faster?
[13321.75s -> 13325.75s]  Will Gordon Ramsay get out or will the Long Chicken Sandwich get out first?
[13325.75s -> 13327.92s]  Why would you punch him out when he's stupid?
[13327.92s -> 13329.92s]  Pull him back into the ring.
[13329.92s -> 13332.48s]  Gordon Ramsay going under the top rubs.
[13332.48s -> 13333.48s]  No.
[13333.48s -> 13334.48s]  Oh, this is bad.
[13334.48s -> 13337.48s]  Long Chicken Sandwich making his way over McRiddler.
[13337.48s -> 13339.48s]  Has got Gordon Ramsay.
[13339.48s -> 13342.48s]  Who is going to go over first?
[13342.48s -> 13343.98s]  Gordon can't.
[13343.98s -> 13345.98s]  McRiddler is distracting Gordon Ramsay.
[13345.98s -> 13348.98s]  As Long Chicken Sandwich is going over.
[13348.98s -> 13351.28s]  Easy Bake oven now has...
[13351.28s -> 13352.28s]  Oh, it's over.
[13352.28s -> 13353.28s]  That's it. It's over.
[13353.28s -> 13355.59s]  You cannot come back. That's it.
[13355.59s -> 13359.08s]  Long Chicken Sandwich gets over the edge.
[13359.08s -> 13360.52s]  Which...
[13360.52s -> 13362.95s]  Why is it not over?
[13362.95s -> 13366.76s]  Wait, the McRiddler has to get over there too.
[13366.76s -> 13369.58s]  Oh, shit.
[13369.58s -> 13375.43s]  They both have to get over the ropes.
[13375.43s -> 13376.43s]  Gordon, what are you doing?
[13376.43s -> 13377.43s]  No, no, no, no. Go over.
[13377.43s -> 13378.43s]  Go over. What are you doing?
[13378.43s -> 13383.80s]  Don't come back in.
[13383.80s -> 13385.80s]  I thought only one had to make it across.
[13385.80s -> 13386.80s]  No.
[13386.80s -> 13388.80s]  They both have to go.
[13388.80s -> 13391.94s]  Still fighting for his life.
[13391.94s -> 13392.94s]  Gordon trying to get over the top ropes.
[13392.94s -> 13395.94s]  Will he get over there still?
[13395.94s -> 13397.94s]  Oh, this is going to get very interesting.
[13397.94s -> 13402.52s]  Gordon Ramsay, I think, made his way over into the cage.
[13402.52s -> 13404.52s]  That's it.
[13404.52s -> 13409.60s]  It just now comes down to these two in the middle of the ring.
[13409.60s -> 13411.60s]  Gordon Ramsay definitely making it over.
[13411.60s -> 13413.60s]  Easy Bake oven now trying to climb up.
[13413.60s -> 13416.24s]  No.
[13416.24s -> 13417.24s]  This is going to be tough.
[13417.24s -> 13419.24s]  I have no idea who's going to win.
[13419.24s -> 13420.87s]  Ramsay out.
[13420.87s -> 13421.87s]  Long Chicken out.
[13421.87s -> 13427.60s]  McRiddler on the way out.
[13427.60s -> 13433.24s]  Will we see an end to this match right now?
[13433.24s -> 13437.80s]  McRiddler getting his leg over the top of the cage.
[13438.80s -> 13441.61s]  Easy Bake oven now climbing up.
[13441.61s -> 13442.61s]  You've got to pull him back.
[13442.61s -> 13443.61s]  Don't punch him.
[13443.61s -> 13444.61s]  Pull him back.
[13444.61s -> 13447.41s]  Oh, shit.
[13447.41s -> 13450.04s]  Oh, what an upset.
[13450.04s -> 13455.62s]  If the Easy Bake oven pulls him over, this is a huge deal.
[13455.62s -> 13463.11s]  Both going at the same exact time.
[13463.11s -> 13465.24s]  No.
[13465.24s -> 13466.24s]  Start fighting.
[13466.24s -> 13467.24s]  Punch, push.
[13467.24s -> 13469.51s]  What are you doing?
[13469.51s -> 13472.51s]  Oh, they're on the top, sitting, straddling the top of the cage.
[13472.51s -> 13474.51s]  Who's going to win?
[13474.51s -> 13475.51s]  The McRiddler.
[13475.51s -> 13478.07s]  The Easy Bake oven.
[13478.07s -> 13479.07s]  What are they?
[13479.07s -> 13482.97s]  It's too tense.
[13482.97s -> 13488.58s]  Be careful you don't knock your opponent to the left because they will win.
[13488.58s -> 13490.65s]  I have no...
[13490.65s -> 13492.65s]  Oh, that's it.
[13492.65s -> 13493.65s]  That's it.
[13493.65s -> 13500.63s]  Long Chicken Sandwich and the McRiddler have won this.
[13500.63s -> 13506.00s]  Unless a New Year's miracle happens, I don't think we're going to see anything else.
[13506.00s -> 13511.62s]  McRiddler and Long Chicken Sandwich have beaten Gordon Ramsay in the Easy Bake oven for Victor
[13511.62s -> 13513.62s]  on the food match.
[13513.62s -> 13515.82s]  That's the end of that one.
[13515.82s -> 13517.82s]  McRiddler and Long Chicken Sandwich.
[13517.82s -> 13522.36s]  That could have gone either way.
[13522.36s -> 13524.24s]  Either way.
[13524.24s -> 13533.72s]  Congratulations to the McRiddler and Long Chicken Sandwich.
[13533.72s -> 13536.11s]  Nice work.
[13536.11s -> 13539.78s]  Fan favorites.
[13539.78s -> 13542.43s]  Scripted.
[13542.43s -> 13543.43s]  What do you mean scripted?
[13543.43s -> 13544.43s]  I didn't script any of this.
[13544.43s -> 13545.43s]  It's all random.
[13545.43s -> 13550.32s]  Okay.
[13550.32s -> 13557.82s]  It's now time to get to the big categories, the meaty ones, the real meaty ones.
[13557.82s -> 13560.21s]  Going up next.
[13560.21s -> 13564.41s]  We've got a long way to go, but we're going to push forward.
[13570.58s -> 13574.20s]  Best Scare Moment of the Year, which is...
[13574.20s -> 13575.57s]  You can probably guess.
[13575.57s -> 13577.57s]  Ummmm...
[13577.57s -> 13578.57s]  Scary Moments.
[13578.57s -> 13580.96s]  VR.
[13580.96s -> 13582.14s]  Non-VR.
[13582.14s -> 13583.14s]  Horror Games.
[13583.14s -> 13584.14s]  Scared.
[13584.14s -> 13585.64s]  I get scared.
[13585.64s -> 13586.64s]  My voice is junk.
[13586.64s -> 13588.00s]  Hold on.
[13588.00s -> 13594.68s]  God, I talked for three hours.
[13594.68s -> 13595.68s]  My voice is junk.
[13595.68s -> 13597.63s]  What the fuck?
[13597.63s -> 13601.83s]  This is the nominees for Best Scare Moment of the Year.
[13601.83s -> 13602.83s]  Wait, did I not mute?
[13602.83s -> 13608.61s]  I muted, right?
[13608.61s -> 13609.61s]  I hope I did.
[13609.61s -> 13612.00s]  Okay.
[13612.00s -> 13613.95s]  Thank God.
[13613.95s -> 13617.32s]  Here are your nominees for Best Scare Moment of the Year.
[13617.32s -> 13618.32s]  Horror Games.
[13618.32s -> 13619.32s]  Jumpscares.
[13620.68s -> 13628.32s]  Did I do it?
[13628.32s -> 13629.56s]  Nobody picked me up.
[13629.56s -> 13634.12s]  I'm like a microphone in an office complex being like, the job is done.
[13634.12s -> 13635.12s]  I just blew it.
[13635.12s -> 13637.45s]  I got too close.
[13637.45s -> 13640.61s]  I was talking.
[13645.63s -> 13647.83s]  Alright.
[13648.83s -> 13651.09s]  Let go!
[13651.09s -> 13653.55s]  Oh, I was holding on to it.
[13653.55s -> 13654.55s]  Let's get this shit out of me.
[13654.55s -> 13656.55s]  I didn't let it go.
[13656.55s -> 13657.55s]  Easy.
[13657.55s -> 13658.55s]  Don't let me get the spray can.
[13658.55s -> 13660.55s]  Don't let me get the fucking spray can.

[13675.70s -> 13682.64s]  What the fuck was that?
[13682.64s -> 13683.64s]  I still...
[13683.64s -> 13685.64s]  I don't know if this is addictive.
[13685.64s -> 13686.64s]  It could be addictive.
[13686.64s -> 13687.64s]  Did he just launch those back at me?
[13687.64s -> 13688.64s]  I don't know.
[13688.64s -> 13689.64s]  Holy shit.
[13689.64s -> 13690.64s]  How are you doing that?
[13690.64s -> 13691.64s]  Where'd he go?
[13701.41s -> 13702.41s]  Why are you alive?
[13732.86s -> 13734.16s]  Ooh, we can break that.

[15987.42s -> 16007.77s]  uncle ted making his debut in the germa rumble from las vegas back from the dead welcome uncle

[16136.57s -> 16144.30s]  goes right for death the two clowns might have the advantage by the way because they're both working
[16144.30s -> 16153.26s]  together eight people in the ring absolute carnage is unfolding edna going for the pin on death
[16153.26s -> 16164.15s]  immediately not even spending one second as we got action outside the ring not even focused
[16164.15s -> 16170.86s]  community jake and the bear outside fighting i don't think there are very there are no rules by the
[16170.86s -> 16181.98s]  way zero weapons count furniture counts false count anywhere it's going to be hard to pay
[16181.98s -> 16192.46s]  attention to what's going on on the screen as uncle ted is already dead for the third time

[16852.90s -> 16873.53s]  versus griffins i'm not going to do that we got another pin on amelia only a two count i wish

[16956.33s -> 16966.31s]  it's so far away from the ring at this point oh amelia could go for a ping a pin right now
[16968.07s -> 16981.16s]  i know no that reverse punch in the face someone's going very soon here then i don't think can they
[16981.16s -> 16993.42s]  go backstage i don't think i can i'm not sure they actually can make it backstage big dropping knee
[16993.42s -> 17003.72s]  on death pin them let's see it come on elimination let's go uncle ted and clown lady somebody pin
[17003.72s -> 17024.92s]  death get rid of death let's go somebody do something that's not punching please all right
[17024.92s -> 17038.36s]  finally they're bullying death yeah i would love to see a pin that's a reversal i don't think uncle
[17038.36s -> 17053.22s]  ted can take more than that though the fatigue has to be setting in amelia now oh ow oh yes getting
[17053.22s -> 17058.10s]  pinned why would you break that up don't break it up but he's stupid you dumb idiot what's wrong

[18307.56s -> 18313.08s]  90 fov in a 1920 by 1080 game like the ability to have it without it being it doesn't make any
[18313.08s -> 18323.91s]  sense i would have fuck capcom fuck you capcom capcom sucks that would i just ruined my game
[18323.91s -> 18328.07s]  experience that would have like scared me and i would have been like holy shit that was so scary

[18333.75s -> 18340.39s]  of this shit if a game is going to release on pc and it's after 2008 if you if it's not 90 fov
[18342.38s -> 18353.91s]  just throw the whole thing to garbage and start over it's the worst console it's the worst console
[18353.91s -> 18359.19s]  it's the worst console they've got to make them little like little fucking like hamburger slices
[18359.83s -> 18366.47s]  oh look it's cute oh it's the switch oh yeah it's in a baby's hand

[18395.21s -> 18399.43s]  is one of us in 10 speak now i'm about to grip it
[18402.07s -> 18427.30s]  ah some pretty bad ones this year uh the worst in particular though by a lot this was not even
[18427.30s -> 18443.61s]  close which is really surprising your worst meltdown of the entire year is warrior wear
[18443.61s -> 18452.58s]  warrior wear with 38 percent of the vote swept it destroyed everybody else nick tunes baseball
[18452.58s -> 18462.55s]  and the capcom rant we're at two and three 38 22 and 13 respectively warrior where i took it
[18462.55s -> 18472.25s]  i mean i i i was melting my brain during that stream all right the next one is pretty special
[18472.25s -> 18478.70s]  to me because obviously um it's not best stream of the year it's not worst stream of the year
[18478.70s -> 18486.79s]  it's best dollhouse moment of the year um every time i see clips of this show and clips of people
[18486.79s -> 18492.39s]  hey that was fun that was a cool the dollhouse thing um this could have won probably every
[18492.39s -> 18498.89s]  category it could have won best joke best stream best meltdown like i didn't want to have it
[18498.89s -> 18506.02s]  nominated for every single category but it has a huge place in my heart as some of the most fun i
[18506.02s -> 18512.76s]  probably ever had in my life so watching you know the music play and different characters come on
[18512.76s -> 18518.76s]  screen and stuff it was uh it's really fun to watch because i have not really seen it i don't
[18518.76s -> 18525.34s]  really um i don't watch a whole lot of the stuff that i do really so seeing like random clips
[18525.34s -> 18531.74s]  every now and then is like oh yeah that was like that was a lot of fun uh so this one is like kind
[18531.74s -> 18538.09s]  of special because this gets its own category it does not get it would have swept every other
[18538.09s -> 18547.26s]  category so we made it its own category um it's it's got a special place here right here so this
[18547.26s -> 18568.39s]  is the best dollhouse moment from the dollhouse streams and here we go i'm very curious what's
[18568.39s -> 18572.87s]  the what scene oh so would you like to spend an evening together is what i'm asking
[18575.56s -> 18579.56s]  would you still respect me if i said yes absolutely
[18588.28s -> 18591.72s]  no no no no no i don't want to fight him he's huge he's huge he's a huge guy

[20007.38s -> 20020.58s]  you think besides dollhouse ladies and gentlemen the winner it was close closer than i thought
[20020.58s -> 20031.94s]  because one of them was a big event with 25 percent of the vote the archaeology stream is
[20031.94s -> 20042.50s]  your winner right behind it at 22 percent was wrestling empire that was very close
[20042.50s -> 20050.76s]  eugleberry's cauldron was underneath that at 10 but the archaeology stream takes it
[20050.76s -> 20058.20s]  besides dollhouse obviously right but i still can't fucking believe i'm sitting here right now
[20060.06s -> 20072.97s]  um i hope this next 2022 is as fun as i had this year i hope so i'm gonna try to do more fun stuff
[20072.97s -> 20081.93s]  i don't know how good it's gonna be but we'll find out without further ado ladies and gentlemen
[20081.93s -> 20086.33s]  i'm not gonna get all sappy i won't get emotional i'm not gonna get sappy people saying cry

[20522.15s -> 20526.39s]  the rumble how are you good to see you peep the horror going over the ropes no sunflower
[20527.03s -> 20534.38s]  uh we might see a removal of the sunflower no silly silly wonka almost going over the top rubs
[20534.38s -> 20541.51s]  while the horror barely and catboy germa coming at number seven keep the horror swinging at
[20541.51s -> 20550.15s]  absolutely nobody as catboy germa comes in a fan favorite not a great place to come into the rumble
[20550.15s -> 20555.19s]  at number seven you really want to come in at least at 15 sunflower getting pushed over by bf
[20555.19s -> 20564.30s]  bugle hot tub bugleberry oh there it goes that's the second elimination from bf bugleberry hot tub
[20564.30s -> 20572.94s]  version really had high hopes for the sunflower sunflower is now eliminated and now here comes

[20578.95s -> 20588.02s]  with lady denitra sue tag team win here trying to come in and stake his victory stake his claim to
[20588.02s -> 20599.40s]  the germa 985 rumble throne potentially oh amelia out eliminated with a big punch by silly silly
[20599.40s -> 20605.94s]  wonka that did not take very much time at all as chris redfield grabs bf bugleberry belly to belly
[20605.94s -> 20615.56s]  suplex our next contestant coming in now is armin from attack on titan erin erin the last time you
[20615.56s -> 20626.28s]  hear that ever as silly silly wonka going over the top ropes by catboy and the horror bugleberry
[20626.28s -> 20635.37s]  still safe are still safe although maybe not for long as chris redfield trying to dump him over
[20635.37s -> 20644.78s]  the top ropes very strong character is chris banana redfield but catboy now they're double
[20644.78s -> 20651.16s]  teaming bf bugleberry together trying to eliminate him and will they get it no they will not
[20652.12s -> 20661.74s]  and here comes jex fan favorite rumble favorite number 10 jex is in the building ready to cause
[20661.74s -> 20667.74s]  havoc and mayhem and show his gamer skills by potentially dumping bugleberry not over the top
[20667.74s -> 20675.93s]  ropes simply smushing his neck and there goes the horror chris redfield eliminated the horror
[20677.14s -> 20686.82s]  with a big right hand and taunting in the middle of the ring as jex is recovering just barely
[20686.82s -> 20692.31s]  getting in the ring and here comes joel from vinesauce was supposed to be in the rumble last
[20692.31s -> 20701.82s]  year but i fucked it up so here comes joel for the first time ever from vine wrestle and there
[20701.82s -> 20712.34s]  goes bugleberry bugleberry is out eliminated first contestant it sucks it's too bad there goes hot
[20712.34s -> 20727.77s]  tub bugleberry almost at number 12 i think 11 armin still in the ring and representing the grotto
[20727.77s -> 20738.41s]  beasts introducing miaudi still where is miaudi why is miaudi not in the ring okay
[20738.41s -> 20747.03s]  it took you a little longer representing grotto beasts is miaudi if miaudi eliminates jex they're
[20747.03s -> 20758.22s]  the favorite jex is 100 stats let's be very clear about this big suplex from armin on joel
[20759.10s -> 20768.01s]  as miaudi can i don't know what now he's doing i would say top seed three cat people are in the
[20768.01s -> 20772.98s]  ring right now homer simpson all of you were looking for homer you finally got your homer
[20772.98s -> 20784.22s]  simpson was not going to put homer in a match but there they are picking up joel and doing a suplex
[20784.22s -> 20791.34s]  to joel swinging belly to back suplex but chris redfield now i i kind of have high hopes for chris
[20791.34s -> 20800.28s]  redfield i say that until oh please don't do it homer homer simpson now is threatening to
[20800.28s -> 20807.27s]  throw chris redfield over the top ropes looks like they might get it and here comes tier list
[20807.27s -> 20818.81s]  andy oh shit he actually did it no uh tier list andy is just a tier list as homer simpson just
[20818.81s -> 20827.13s]  absolutely decimates crisp banana redfield really sad stuff that we're seeing here what tier list
[20827.13s -> 20834.97s]  is on tier list andy i don't know it's hard to tell i don't know what what is on his back
[20836.52s -> 20844.20s]  as miaudi eliminates cat boy germa cat eliminates cat who could see that coming from a while away i
[20844.20s -> 20853.24s]  don't know cat boy gone miaudi eliminates cat boy when i told you top seed i meant it i was not
[20853.24s -> 20865.13s]  messing around i really meant it as homer simpson now in the corner jex gets a get gets armin armin
[20865.53s -> 20869.53s]  i think from the last match really kind of got annoyed at me talking about how shitty he was
[20870.33s -> 20879.43s]  and how not strong that armin was trying to go for jex which is a huge mistake you don't go for
[20879.43s -> 20886.39s]  jex in quotes that's how you die as miaudi and homer simpson with tier list andy in the mix as
[20886.39s -> 20893.53s]  well joel from vinesauce also is there still fighting for his life against tier list andy
[20894.01s -> 20900.20s]  if homer simpson wins the rumble i will eat glass on stream make that clear
[20902.06s -> 20918.42s]  it's the fucking way as miaudi now is over on the right side who's the next competitor it's mr
[20918.42s -> 20927.10s]  green or mr greens and depending on who you are you can say it however you want here's mr greens
[20927.10s -> 20932.92s]  he's in the last rumble making his second or third appearance in the germa rumble here going right
[20932.92s -> 20939.10s]  for armin armin now over the top ropes might oh there goes jex miaudi's top seed i would be
[20939.10s -> 20944.30s]  terrified of miaudi right now homer simpson and mr green trying to get armin out we will never
[20944.30s -> 20952.31s]  hear erin again hopefully thank god we'll never hear it again armin has been eliminated by homer
[20952.31s -> 20960.54s]  simpson and mr green as josh from science center nevada science josh making his first appearance
[20960.54s -> 20968.70s]  in the germa rumble there he is the archaeologist geologist whatever i'm sorry science center josh
[20968.70s -> 20977.43s]  making his appearance as armin is really slowly getting up here hopefully not injured just to go
[20977.43s -> 20985.72s]  homer missed completely science center nevada josh just powerbomb joel outside the ring there goes joel
[20987.67s -> 20996.55s]  joel has been eliminated from the germa rumble sorry joel it's been a pleasure to have you but

[21019.75s -> 21027.59s]  i think fifth or sixth elimination no don't powerbomb josh out oh fuck homer simpson powerbomb
[21027.59s -> 21032.55s]  science center josh outside the ring but torgo making their appearance coming in hot
[21035.43s -> 21045.85s]  here comes torgo high hopes for torgo from mano's hands of fate mr green now looking at
[21045.85s -> 21053.16s]  homer simpson trying to get him out of here i hope we see it please get rid of homer
[21053.88s -> 21063.11s]  homer cannot win it can't happen where's the music somebody just grab the ropes and dump him over
[21063.19s -> 21073.69s]  oh my god the mcgriddler at number 18 coming in saw the mcgriddler earlier but i would love to see

[21130.65s -> 21136.14s]  sorry miaudi that's that's very unfortunate i would have liked to see miaudi go all the way
[21136.14s -> 21147.34s]  at least the top five here comes germadillo a bttv emote i'm probably we'll probably see it a few
[21151.50s -> 21157.24s]  god who just got thrown out what what happened who got eliminated what happened
[21158.34s -> 21165.54s]  oh mr green is gone germadillo i will literally make you a real emote if you get rid of homer
[21165.54s -> 21176.09s]  simpson right now oh two back-to-back eliminations who was that the sus guy and tier list andy
[21177.54s -> 21187.13s]  i'm not kidding i will make germadillo a paid emote if he eliminates homer simpson sus guy
[21187.13s -> 21200.01s]  and tier list andy both gone getting down to the final i believe 12 competitors in this rumble
[21204.12s -> 21212.86s]  homer simpson still in it torgo now and germadillo please mcridler get rid of him
[21214.68s -> 21221.98s]  do not let homer simpson win let's see a double elimination it's possible although i don't know
[21221.98s -> 21229.83s]  how probable there goes no he saved it still held on william carslough i'm sure a bunch of
[21229.83s -> 21234.55s]  people probably saying who right now that's fine because that's the battleship captain from the
[21234.55s -> 21248.38s]  battleship meta that is the battleship captain he's got a name you know going right for the
[21248.38s -> 21254.58s]  mcridler the failed meta that meta was fine for like a week it was like two or three weeks give
[21254.58s -> 21265.77s]  me a break this is a real guy i is it a real guy i don't know number 22 coming in dollhouse germa
[21277.43s -> 21288.22s]  please get rid of homer simpson as the mcridler gets him in the top he's on the turnbuckle this
[21288.22s -> 21296.63s]  is really bad spot to be for homer help him go help him william carslough whatever your goddamn
[21296.63s -> 21306.02s]  name is real historical landing oh my god wait no like it's spampton from delta rune chapter two
[21306.02s -> 21313.80s]  spampton is joining the rumble for the first time ever i thought he threw out immediately
[21318.89s -> 21328.04s]  spampton welcome everybody spampton homer simpson is still in this rumble as william carslough
[21328.04s -> 21333.56s]  really trying to just trying to find out is he c3 is he d5 i doesn't know where homer's battleship
[21333.80s -> 21338.36s]  he's really trying to find it didn't find it unfortunately here comes fish bastard
[21338.36s -> 21349.27s]  at number 24 from the hot tub stream one of bugleberry's many disgusting absurd
[21349.27s -> 21355.69s]  horrific creations of all the things it looks like the mcridler is gonna have to deal with
[21355.69s -> 21365.56s]  the fish bastard one-on-one here will the fish bastard take out the mcridler with the help of
[21365.56s -> 21370.12s]  spampton they really went this is potentially a newfound alliance we're seeing here
[21373.83s -> 21379.77s]  warner von brawn is the oh oh oh oh guy there goes torgo by homer simpson
[21383.80s -> 21391.03s]  oh oh makes up number 24 second simpson's character that's right so if there's somebody
[21391.03s -> 21399.05s]  to eliminate homer simpson it's definitely him torgo i don't think you'll be in the next rumble
[21399.05s -> 21408.02s]  but it was really nice to have you thanks for coming spampton fish bastard mcridler and
[21408.02s -> 21416.47s]  warner von brawn no just barely hangs on is the mcridler while dollhouse germa is still fighting
[21416.47s -> 21422.15s]  the battleship captain which is strange because i mean that's his meta he created that meta that's
[21422.15s -> 21428.04s]  just like that's his meta it's weird that he'd be fighting against that meta i mean you could argue
[21428.04s -> 21433.00s]  that like ludwig and others made that meta happen because germa's an irrelevant andy
[21433.00s -> 21437.56s]  and really didn't have much pull at all but just decided to ask in a relevant brain he's gone
[21437.56s -> 21455.45s]  germa's gone fuck him who cares who gives a shit about that guy well there goes dollhouse germa
[21456.09s -> 21467.06s]  i don't think germa's ever going to win a competition why would he big big what's that
[21467.06s -> 21472.18s]  called the gold gold rush i don't know whatever the guy's name is goldman what's the guy's name
[21472.18s -> 21479.16s]  goldberg big goldberg jackhammer on homer simpson has the battleship captain really
[21479.16s -> 21484.04s]  taken it to homer simpson now here this would be a real big relief for me there he goes
[21484.60s -> 21490.36s]  goodbye homer simpson goodbye spampton battleship captain and eliminate finally homer simpson
[21492.84s -> 21505.45s]  thank god here comes anubis from smite getting us to 26 characters i saw anubis earlier in the
[21505.45s -> 21520.50s]  evening i don't have to eat glass anymore good somebody in this ring could be your 2021 champion
[21520.50s -> 21527.30s]  of this and there goes mick redler i'm sad about that i think a lot of other people might be too
[21528.39s -> 21534.55s]  i'm not happy about what i just saw that's sad i was rooting for the mick redler the whole time
[21537.62s -> 21545.27s]  still four contestants that have yet to come out it's all random by the way i have no control
[21545.27s -> 21552.92s]  over any of the things you're seeing on screen i just put them into the rumble fish bastard down
[21552.92s -> 21568.50s]  no just going for a taunt stupid move hockey um um will you put him down it's his year well
[21569.54s -> 21574.90s]  it very well could be considering that glue man is number 27 in the rumble 2021
[21576.04s -> 21583.82s]  great opportunity for glue man is it glue man's year this year will we see a glue man victory for
[21583.82s -> 21595.85s]  the first time in almost seven years that's to be determined i don't want to get my hopes up
[21596.57s -> 21606.20s]  but this could be glue man's year 27 welcome back glue man for the seventh or eighth annual time
[21607.32s -> 21615.02s]  i hope oh my that's gets tricky here when you get mr satan comes in from wrestling empire
[21615.90s -> 21624.39s]  mr satan is now in the ring not only has experience in wrestling but also has experience
[21624.39s -> 21631.75s]  being the strongest man in the non-state or whatever it doesn't matter oh boy that's bad
[21634.01s -> 21642.81s]  mr satan eliminates ooh oh we are about to see the final two competitors in this rumble who will
[21642.81s -> 21652.95s]  they be promwell the guardian praying mantis at number 29 it's a great place to come in
[21654.36s -> 21661.88s]  he might be small or praying mantis eat each other and they kill each other and pound for pound
[21661.96s -> 21672.07s]  he could pick up two fucking mac trucks promwell welcome to the germa rumble as mr satan with
[21672.07s -> 21680.57s]  anubis in the corner here there goes anubis we are down to our final competitor of the year

[21829.05s -> 21844.15s]  right what a buzzkill the final five you're going to crash why because the lala dog went up on the

[21853.10s -> 21861.88s]  final person oh my god this is such a good show and fish bastard really was that the final five

[22062.70s -> 22069.16s]  and the lala dog looks like we might see an immediate elimination in this final five
[22069.96s -> 22076.84s]  there goes cromwell for this be the year of the glue man i've been doing this every year
[22076.84s -> 22081.10s]  since like 2012 and glue man has been there since the very beginning
[22083.38s -> 22097.43s]  will we actually get a glue man germa rumble victory i don't know but we're down to the final
[22097.43s -> 22104.31s]  five blue man picking up the lala dog looks like lala could see the end here
[22105.27s -> 22113.40s]  yeah all right final four no fish bastard has glue man up on the ropes
[22114.98s -> 22123.11s]  this is glue man's year it can't be oh fish bastard like the worst character made in the cauldron
[22123.11s -> 22130.81s]  you can't eliminate glue man thank goodness the battleship captain has glue man now we have to see
[22130.81s -> 22142.95s]  a momentum change here or this is a huge problem mr satan fish bastard glue man's gotta get every
[22142.95s -> 22151.03s]  need to give glue man our strength there goes fish bastard down to the final three mr satan
[22151.03s -> 22160.15s]  battleship captain and glue man i have no idea what's gonna happen but i have an outcome that
[22160.15s -> 22166.52s]  i want i don't know if it's outcome we're gonna get as mr satan grabs glue man now by the wrist
[22168.02s -> 22180.25s]  big reversal by glue man no no you gotta reverse these glue man there it is big reversal
[22183.78s -> 22187.94s]  gets clothesline for his effort so much energy so much effort from glue man
[22191.82s -> 22195.50s]  slow to get up though which is bad which means the fatigue is really high
[22196.22s -> 22206.68s]  as mr satan goes into the ropes battleship captain holy shit mr satan no double reversal here
[22208.63s -> 22218.46s]  a triple reversal they're gonna double team and get him over the ropes mr satan is about
[22218.46s -> 22227.78s]  to eliminate the battleship captain as glue man watches on no still gaining some strength it seems
[22229.86s -> 22240.47s]  big russian sweet whatever that's called oh no mr satan with the big double arm tiger suplex
[22241.75s -> 22246.39s]  you gotta be shitting me glue man gonna go for a throw mr satan over the top ropes
[22247.19s -> 22259.11s]  he's hungry this year he's starving for it no it's not gonna be enough he gets reversed
[22262.36s -> 22272.17s]  don't be an idiot glue man no he's getting too cocky oh shit you've been here for seven straight
[22272.17s -> 22280.94s]  years glue man you can't just be cocky and go taunt mr satan big reversal though elbow to the
[22280.94s -> 22287.46s]  face of mr satan i'm actually kind of nervous for glue man right now this is kind of bad
[22293.67s -> 22302.14s]  two belly-to-belly suplexes mr satan is stacked cleaning up the ring right now
[22302.70s -> 22313.26s]  i'm surprised the battleship captain has lasted this long one of these three will be crowned
[22313.26s -> 22326.38s]  champion of the rumble and we all know who we want it to be go for it glue man stop being cocky go
[22326.38s -> 22333.70s]  for it cool you know i think the problem is he's never had this much screen time before
[22334.66s -> 22345.69s]  he's milking the audience and it's going to be his downfall this is the most screen time he's
[22345.69s -> 22357.43s]  ever had he's hoping to get a book deal after this is over big belly to back suplex will the
[22357.43s -> 22375.51s]  cockiness oh god it's over he's gone glue man has been eliminated see you later that's very sad
[22378.09s -> 22385.59s]  battleship captain and mr satan are the final two competitors this year better luck next year
[22385.59s -> 22392.87s]  yeah unfortunate the hubris i know what was he doing he's like taunting he's going on the
[22392.87s -> 22403.56s]  top ropes like get down man what's wrong with you rip rip rip yeah sad you hate to see it
[22404.20s -> 22416.10s]  it looks like mr satan is going no he's not this would be quite an upset if william carslark the
[22416.10s -> 22441.08s]  battleship captain wins the game what an upset uh i need to take it that was so i didn't think
[22441.08s -> 22453.96s]  he's gonna do it that quickly he is the strongest man on earth so it makes sense right
[22463.16s -> 22466.44s]  i am the strongest man on earth i'm the strongest man a wrestler
[22468.17s -> 22472.89s]  check out next episode uh when i billy the bellic suplex and that guy over the top rope
