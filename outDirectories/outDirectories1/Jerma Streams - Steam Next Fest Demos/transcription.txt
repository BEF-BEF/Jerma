[2.23s -> 11.11s]  Hey. Hey, friend. How you doing? What's going on? Give me... I'm just catching my breath. I just ran.
[11.11s -> 15.59s]  You guys have no idea what it's like behind the scenes. There's a lot of running. There's a lot of
[15.59s -> 21.19s]  running. There's a lot of... of... of... of... My drink is not ready. There's not enough ice in it.
[22.58s -> 29.26s]  It's crazy behind the scenes here. There's not enough ice in my drink. Shit's crazy here.
[29.82s -> 44.47s]  Anyways, how you doing? Jeremy, we're always on time. Not me. Let me make a tweet. We'll talk about
[44.47s -> 89.93s]  a bunch of stuff. Just give me a minute. BRB. Okay. Do you guys know what I'm talking about
[89.93s -> 97.61s]  when I say that? When you realize that you put ice in your drink and you look over at it,
[97.61s -> 105.48s]  there's three or four little pea-sized ice cubes and it just ruins the rest of your entire day.
[105.48s -> 110.52s]  It's like that and then you take a sip out of it and this shit's lukewarm. It's not even cold.
[111.08s -> 124.20s]  You almost get annoyed that you want to just fish those out because they're not doing anything.
[124.84s -> 130.79s]  I know. I'm just fucking around. Play papers, please. I've already played papers, please.
[131.35s -> 143.67s]  Are you guys like me? If you're like me, a drink... Correct me here if you need to.
[144.76s -> 157.91s]  A drink needs to be either very hot or very cold. Unless it's water. If we're talking about a glass
[157.91s -> 162.79s]  of water, that can be room temp. That's fine. Anything else that's not water, that shit better
[162.79s -> 173.54s]  be ice cold or piping hot. Yeah, room temperature water is the way that I like to drink water.
[173.54s -> 180.39s]  If you're not talking about what... Nobody wants to drink a lukewarm fruit punch.
[180.95s -> 191.64s]  Nobody wants to drink a barely kind of not really even room temp coffee or tea. No. Ice coffee? Yep.
[192.36s -> 206.39s]  Hot coffee? Yep. Cold fruit punch? Yep. Hot fruit punch? No. Lukewarm fruit punch? Absolutely not.
[208.06s -> 217.22s]  I would rather drink a hot fruit punch than a lukewarm room temperature one. Does that make me
[217.22s -> 242.71s]  weird? Does it? Okay. Well, whatever. Today, we were going to play... We were going to do DreadX today,
[243.80s -> 248.04s]  but like all things on this channel and all streams you've seen on this channel,
[248.84s -> 254.73s]  last second I pivoted to something else 25 minutes ago. And instead of doing that,
[255.37s -> 263.03s]  we're going to do that tomorrow, we're going to do something interesting.
[263.67s -> 272.17s]  No, I'm not going to play the Quarry. Guys, so many people have streamed that game that you
[272.17s -> 282.73s]  probably have memorized the entire script. I would be in the game and I would look over here and you
[282.73s -> 298.30s]  would just be writing dialogue as it was happening. I didn't play the last one either. I don't know.
[298.30s -> 307.29s]  I'd rather do DreadX than the Quarry. I have my resident sleepers on standby.
[308.68s -> 311.40s]  Well, you better put those away because what we're actually doing...
[315.08s -> 323.21s]  There is an event going on on Steam right now. It is the Steam Demo Day week. And what that means
[323.21s -> 330.31s]  is there are thousands, I think, or hundreds of demos on Steam. And I've got it open here.
[331.78s -> 335.22s]  And I'm going to scroll through and we're going to pick a random shit to play. And I'm going to
[335.22s -> 345.48s]  give you my real... I'm going to give you my real opinions on a scale of one to five. Five being the
[345.48s -> 353.90s]  best. One being decent. Kind of decent. We're not trying to discourage anybody here, okay?
[374.44s -> 382.14s]  One being decent. Five being great. There is... No, there is no scale. Why would I even rate them?
[382.14s -> 388.76s]  I'm not going to rate them. I just think it's a fun idea. We want click maps. We want click maps.
[388.76s -> 395.40s]  No, you're not getting click maps. It takes too long. I'll give you my honest... I'm not going
[395.40s -> 399.10s]  to give them a score of one through five. I'm going to give you my honest opinions of what I
[399.10s -> 403.72s]  thought about the demo, okay? Oh, there are a thousand of these. So we kind of have to go.
[404.36s -> 408.60s]  We're going to get started. I'm just going to pick out ones that I think look interesting.
[408.60s -> 412.98s]  I'm going to install them. We're going to go. I'm already seeing some pretty interesting looking
[412.98s -> 431.98s]  ones. Are you guys ready? How do you feel? You feel good? You feel good? Can I just test my noise
[431.98s -> 446.73s]  limiter here? It's not sound fine? Yeah, whatever. Okay. Some of these look good. Are these games
[446.73s -> 451.37s]  even out? No, they're coming soon. These games aren't even released yet, but there's demos for
[451.37s -> 459.42s]  them. This is kind of cool. What the hell's going on here? I'm actually... This is really cool. All
[459.42s -> 468.74s]  right, here we go. So as you see here... Hi, how are you? As you see here, we have quite the list
[468.74s -> 475.78s]  of games here. Each one of these has a demo, and I'm literally just going to scroll through and see
[475.78s -> 480.26s]  if one pops out that I think looks cool. I already got one I think that looks cool already. What's
[480.26s -> 487.56s]  this one? This one's a roguelike? What do you guys think? We're not going to start at one. There are
[487.56s -> 493.72s]  a thousand demos. We're not starting at one. I look like a fucking caveman today. I sometimes
[493.72s -> 505.00s]  look over here, and I catch what I look like on the preview, man. This one? This one looks kind
[505.00s -> 510.28s]  of cool. All right, I'm going to do this one. Wait, I can buy this? I thought it was not out.
[510.28s -> 513.80s]  Oh, pre-purchase. Okay. All right, so we're going to go for this one. I'm going to install it. You
[513.80s -> 521.94s]  guys ready? This shouldn't take too long. I've got fiber optic internet. It's taking a little
[521.94s -> 538.18s]  longer than I thought. It won't even launch the game. Is it ready to go? I'm killing my internet
[538.18s -> 558.46s]  by doing this too. Okay. What was this called? Cult of the Lamb? Where is it? Where is it? I just
[558.46s -> 573.00s]  downloaded it. Where the fuck is it? Steam is not down. Is steam down? Steam is not down for
[573.00s -> 593.99s]  maintenance. Do not say that. What the fuck? What? It's down for maintenance? It's Tuesday. Oh, come
[593.99s -> 602.82s]  on. The second that I turned the stream on is... Oh my god. I thought I only had one more day for
[602.82s -> 613.86s]  this. I did not plan this. Why is fucking maintenance day? When does it start? When
[613.86s -> 620.86s]  is maintenance over in like an hour? I'll play Dread X maybe. Tell us a story. It's back up?
[620.86s -> 630.94s]  How would it be down for maintenance and back up in fucking two minutes? God damn it. All right,
[630.94s -> 656.60s]  let me see. Let me see. Is it there? Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Oh, tell us a story. What do
[656.60s -> 669.26s]  you want for a story? It's down. I still can't download anything. I did not plan this
[669.26s -> 684.54s]  I promise you. Restart steam. So do I need to restart steam? It's not down. It's back up for me.
[684.54s -> 689.93s]  When do they usually do this? Whatever. I just started. We're just gonna hang out. We're gonna
[689.93s -> 695.56s]  hang out. The downtime is only about five minutes. Yeah, then let's just hang out. Whatever. Guys,
[695.56s -> 699.72s]  it's not like World of Warcraft. They're not gonna bring steam down for like 12 hours every
[699.72s -> 705.61s]  day or every other day. Whatever it is. Every fucking horrible. Can you imagine if they did
[705.61s -> 724.82s]  maintenance every other day for 12 hours? This game actually looks kind of fun. The expansion
[724.90s -> 735.29s]  launch. It's every week. Yeah, it's every week. I don't know. What are you saying? Talk about.
[735.29s -> 739.53s]  Oh shit. That's right. This is insane. Can I just show you something? Well, I can't. I don't know
[739.53s -> 745.96s]  if I can show you, but this is absolutely insane. So somebody in the community and let me just be
[745.96s -> 750.60s]  very, very honest with you here. I've told you this a thousand times before. Nobody listens to me when
[750.60s -> 761.08s]  I say this, but, but there is something really cool here. Somebody in the community is a fucking
[761.08s -> 767.14s]  scientist and they found. Let me get, let me get it out here. I gotta get some images here. This
[767.14s -> 776.73s]  is fucking crazy. If you want to look into it, you can. So let me, let me read this here. So,
[776.73s -> 780.57s]  uh, I have something really cool to share. This is by somebody in the community.
[781.13s -> 783.77s]  Are they comfortable with you sharing their name? I don't want to share their name if they're not
[783.77s -> 791.66s]  comfortable. Uh, but anyways, they discovered a new way of isolating viruses that kill antibiotic
[791.66s -> 799.30s]  resistant bacteria. Somebody in this community. And the first one I discovered using this method,
[799.38s -> 810.60s]  I named after German. This is a fucking goddamn discovery. They have pictures of the, of the
[810.60s -> 825.30s]  Petri dishes and this apparently is real. And they named it like the German nine, eight, five, like
[825.30s -> 840.07s]  Eddie thing. I don't know what it is. Let me see if I can pull up an image here. Yeah. Let me just
[840.07s -> 845.38s]  show you the Petri dish. Cause we, we, we, we, we, we, we, this was shared with us. I was sitting
[845.38s -> 856.18s]  there going, Holy Oh my God. Take a look at this. No, it's not fake. This is real. It's the German
[856.18s -> 870.15s]  nine, eight, five. How do you pronounce that? So they're, they're okay with me sharing their name.
[870.15s -> 873.99s]  All right. Well, the name, the name, I'll give them, I'll give them the, the, the discord name.
[873.99s -> 880.68s]  The discord name is Jared da, Jared underscore dying discord. And they have some fucking
[880.68s -> 885.16s]  breakthrough medical research shit here. Like it's actually phenomenal. Uh, this is, it's
[885.16s -> 916.89s]  blowing me away. Take a look at this. Take a look at this. Take a look at this. Hey, take a look at
[916.89s -> 931.48s]  this. That this is apparently it fucking working against bacteria, uh, antibiotic,
[931.48s -> 944.92s]  bacteria resistant shit. This is real. No, this is not a kid in high school biology. All right.
[944.92s -> 954.33s]  Stop saying that. This is like a fucking doctor scientist, but no, this, uh, I'm flattered. I
[954.33s -> 963.90s]  really wish you'd put your name on it. I didn't do this. No, they're not pancakes guys. This is,
[963.98s -> 970.38s]  and I said this out loud. This community has got a shitload of doctors, a shitload of scientists,
[971.02s -> 976.94s]  a shitload of, uh, creative, uh, editing artists. Uh, this, there's so many people in this
[976.94s -> 988.01s]  community. You're all doctors and scientists and I, I, I, I'm proving it today. You need to infect
[988.01s -> 996.01s]  yourself with this. I just like drink this. I drink like a potion with like a bunch of,
[1000.62s -> 1005.18s]  these are not pancakes. Do you guys know anything about scientific medical research? You don't know
[1005.18s -> 1014.38s]  anything, do you? That's me in there. That's me taking care of that. I'm in there and I'm
[1014.38s -> 1024.15s]  getting all of those fucking molecules and I'm destroying them. Let me see this one.
[1024.15s -> 1035.83s]  Flooded second dilution set with the solution on it. Hold on. Is this, it's a plaque essay,
[1036.47s -> 1042.55s]  a pure, a purification. I'm not getting like gas lit, right? No, this is real. No, it actually is.
[1042.55s -> 1056.39s]  Steam's working. Well, I don't want to obviously put, I want to make sure this, uh, this person
[1056.39s -> 1061.61s]  doesn't get flooded, but I want to at least share a little bit of that because that's really cool.
[1061.61s -> 1067.72s]  Somebody found a way to target antibiotic resistant bacteria. Put your name on it,
[1067.72s -> 1089.78s]  though. It deserves to be you, not me. You guys ready? It's real. Yes, it is. You're coming. No,
[1089.78s -> 1095.37s]  it's not. It's not gas lighting. It's no, it's not. I swear to God, it's not this. I just don't want
[1095.37s -> 1100.47s]  to like blow up this. I don't want it to be like, oh my God, everybody go like that. You know what
[1100.47s -> 1105.67s]  I mean? Like it's a cool thing. I just want to share it. All right, let's go. I'm going to try
[1105.67s -> 1119.38s]  to do this again. Let's see if it works. I believe you. Okay. You ready? Call to the lamb,
[1119.38s -> 1137.34s]  install demo. There we go. There we are. Just kidding. It didn't work. Let me try a different
[1137.34s -> 1146.30s]  one. You should play smite. I actually need to get ready. I got to play smite. I got to prepare.
[1146.30s -> 1155.30s]  You don't know what I'm talking about. I'm going to potentially be in a, in a tournament for smite.
[1155.30s -> 1161.93s]  Ms. Skip is holding a smite tournament and I was very vocal about how badly I wanted to be in it.
[1161.93s -> 1167.80s]  So I got to like practice. All right, let me try a different one. And maybe it's just that one's
[1167.80s -> 1184.39s]  fucked up. Okay. How about now? Will this one work? It just takes me to the store page and then
[1184.39s -> 1192.14s]  I can't download it. All right. So when I go to this, when I click on install demo, it takes me
[1192.14s -> 1204.46s]  to the store page and then it says download and I can't download it. Same, same exact things happening
[1204.46s -> 1210.62s]  to us. Should I just open up dread X and just say, fuck it. Maybe I should restart steam. I'll try
[1210.62s -> 1224.55s]  restarting steam. This is, I like, this is cool. Just kind of hanging out, talking for a little bit.
[1224.55s -> 1233.16s]  Is it working fine now? There's music playing. It's, that's the trailer you're hearing.
[1233.16s -> 1237.96s]  The demos go away. The demos go until the 20th. So if you can't do it today, all right. Well,
[1237.96s -> 1241.59s]  I'm going to give this like five more minutes after I restart it. And if not, then we're just
[1241.59s -> 1256.79s]  going to do direct X like we were planning on doing anyways. So it's all good. It's all good.
[1256.79s -> 1264.60s]  Stretch the webcam out. It isn't kind of a weird spot, isn't it? No, I don't want to stretch it
[1264.60s -> 1272.33s]  out because it's going to screw up and I'm going to have to reset everything. I'm trying to get it
[1272.33s -> 1297.37s]  to work system. Okay. Come on. Anger foot install demo. No download. Nope. Let me try. Let me try
[1297.37s -> 1314.86s]  restarting steam again. Sunflower update. Haven't planted them. It was actually, here's the thing.
[1314.86s -> 1319.48s]  There's a lot going on in the next month or two that I was kind of scared that I wouldn't be able
[1319.48s -> 1326.95s]  to give them the attention that they deserved. So I was afraid to plant them. Oh, baseball,
[1326.95s -> 1331.11s]  baseball, baseball, baseball. We're going to talk about baseball. Yeah, whatever. I'm going to be
[1331.11s -> 1335.53s]  streaming all day today. So don't worry. I'm not going to leave in like three hours. So,
[1339.29s -> 1352.04s]  and you said it and now I'm thinking about it. I should have planted them. Yes. I have a custom
[1352.04s -> 1360.07s]  made cup of the sunflowers. Okay. Let me restart this baseball, baseball. Very important. Okay.
[1360.07s -> 1367.46s]  Listen, the baseball date has to change. It is no longer the 14th. It is not July 14th. The baseball
[1367.46s -> 1375.30s]  date is changing to July 20th. Only about six days. We had to do a lot of changes, a lot of stuff
[1375.30s -> 1381.93s]  with the venue and the, trust me, we didn't want to move it, but we had to. So only like six days
[1381.93s -> 1387.38s]  later, July 20th is a new date. I will let you know if anything else happens, if anything else
[1388.31s -> 1396.92s]  goes on behind the scenes, I'll let you know. You'll be first to know. We had no choice. And
[1396.92s -> 1403.27s]  when I say that, trust me, we had no choice. Had to do it. All right. With Steam. Open Steam, please.
[1403.27s -> 1422.47s]  I fucking hate computers. All right. Steam. God, I fucking hate computers. What the fuck is that?
[1422.47s -> 1425.91s]  All right. Come on. Does anybody confirm that it works? Otherwise I'm doing DreadEx.
[1426.47s -> 1453.05s]  What happened to this? This is five minutes. Steam maintenance. Download something on Steam
[1453.05s -> 1459.37s]  right now. I'm downloading something literally right now. It's up. I just restarted it. The
[1459.37s -> 1472.17s]  stream is going to be like seven or eight hours, guys. Don't worry. I can't believe they would have
[1472.17s -> 1481.66s]  maintenance during the big event. Can't believe it. Wait, does he really think that Steam is down?
[1481.66s -> 1492.74s]  So what's happening? What are you talking about? There's no maintenance. You guys have made it up.
[1492.74s -> 1503.24s]  No, you didn't. Why would this not be working? All right. I'm about to throw a towel in and just
[1503.24s -> 1514.01s]  play DreadEx. Okay. I'm going to give this until, so the stream has been on for 25 minutes. If by
[1514.01s -> 1518.57s]  minute number 30, we don't have some progress here, I'm going to DreadEx and I'm just saying,
[1518.57s -> 1529.32s]  fuck it, whatever. Steam has maintenance every Tuesday. But why don't they, why do maintenance?
[1529.96s -> 1536.04s]  I know that this is a North American Andy talking, right? Do maintenance at like two in the morning.
[1536.04s -> 1549.46s]  Why do maintenance at fucking four o'clock in the afternoon? One, 12 midnight maintenance or
[1549.46s -> 1559.19s]  1 a.m. maintenance means that that's what? Like seven a.m. EU, six or seven a.m. EU. That's like
[1559.19s -> 1575.86s]  eight in the morning EU. That's all right. You can wait till like eight a.m. to play. You want
[1575.86s -> 1589.03s]  them to come into the office at 2 a.m.? No, I want them to unplug the router. What do they even do?
[1593.00s -> 1598.46s]  Speaking like someone that has no idea how this system even works. To me, always, I would always
[1598.46s -> 1602.39s]  get so, all right, let's talk about this for a second while we have time. I would always get so
[1602.39s -> 1608.50s]  mad at the Warcraft, World of Warcraft maintenance because it was, I just, in my brain, it was,
[1609.14s -> 1615.29s]  they were turning on and turning off the servers. That's, that was what they needed to do. And that
[1615.29s -> 1621.51s]  was it. They just had to turn on, like, unplug and then turn it back on. But then it got me
[1621.51s -> 1626.07s]  thinking even more. What do you, what actually goes on during maintenance? Like what actually
[1626.07s -> 1630.79s]  is happening? Are they like clearing out a bunch of cash? What, what is maintenance? What is it?
[1630.79s -> 1637.50s]  What does that mean? Somebody can, can somebody enlighten me? What does that mean? When they say,
[1637.50s -> 1643.27s]  oh, every Tuesday, maintenance, what's that mean? What do they do? It's, it's, they're maintaining.
[1643.27s -> 1657.21s]  But what, what are they doing? Cash, backups, updating hardware, updating the system,
[1657.29s -> 1665.96s]  software updates, backups, hot fixes, hardware stuff. They're cleaning it with a toothbrush.
[1665.96s -> 1677.16s]  It's maintenance because in my brain, maintenance is always, oh, it's okay. What do you, what is
[1677.16s -> 1683.54s]  going on though? Are all these systems just barely functioning and every week we have to turn them
[1683.54s -> 1693.30s]  all off and it has to be a bunch of fucking crazy shit behind the scenes till they keep them on?
[1693.30s -> 1697.22s]  Oh yeah, guys, just a weekly maintenance, you know, just maintaining things, just making sure
[1697.22s -> 1701.67s]  everything works. Okay. Making sure that your stuff, your services are up. Not a big deal.
[1701.83s -> 1707.35s]  Just every, for a few hours every Tuesday, that's okay. But behind the scenes, it's like,
[1707.35s -> 1713.67s]  we are a sneeze away from everything turning off permanently. Every service we have is permanently
[1713.67s -> 1725.06s]  going to shut off. We're fucking hours away. Is that what it's, is that what it's like?
[1725.06s -> 1733.88s]  And I'm just sitting back here like, fucking turn on my game, idiot. And right now there is a guy
[1733.88s -> 1739.74s]  at like Steam, like Valve HQ, fucking running down a hallway with like a clipboard in his hand,
[1739.74s -> 1744.71s]  just like, okay, there's a fucking hundred fucking things I got to do. That system is in,
[1744.71s -> 1749.32s]  I see red. I see red. I got to go to that one now. I'm just sitting here waiting for them to
[1749.32s -> 1755.46s]  turn it on. And somebody is, is, is, is, there's a lot of drama going on behind the scenes.
[1755.46s -> 1761.75s]  Residence lever. Just relax. No, wake up. Don't relax even more. You'll fall asleep. Stay, wake
[1761.75s -> 1776.46s]  up. No, I don't want you to relax. I want you to like prep up a little. Is it working? It's been
[1776.46s -> 1790.26s]  30 minutes. Yeah, it has. All right. Does it work? Let's try. I'm going to try restarting. Come on.
[1790.34s -> 1799.70s]  Hey, hey, everyone that said the Steam is only going to be down for five minutes. It's been 30.
[1799.70s -> 1819.54s]  Okay. We're going to come on. Call to the lamb, install demo. Dude, come on. Try a different one.
[1819.54s -> 1826.09s]  I tried three already. Pick a different demo. All right. I'm going to try like a few of these.
[1826.09s -> 1830.15s]  It's all right. We're just hanging out. Don't worry. Okay. How about this one called potion permit.
[1830.15s -> 1839.05s]  Should I do this one? No, I'm clicking on install demo and it's just taking me to the store page.
[1839.61s -> 1855.26s]  Okay. So now there's a download demo and I click it and it just refreshes that game store page.
[1855.26s -> 1860.86s]  Exit Steam. I did. All right. I want to do this though. I so badly want to do this. This
[1860.86s -> 1869.32s]  will sound like a fun idea. Check your library. No, it's not there. Potion. Yeah, it's not even
[1869.32s -> 1875.66s]  here. I really wanted to do this. When I get on something, I have to do it. I can't just not do
[1875.66s -> 1887.18s]  it. Did you ban from Steam? No, I'm not. This dude's hallucinating. I am not hallucinating.
[1887.50s -> 1901.11s]  They're not even doing a demo thing. You made it up. All right. You know how I know that? No,
[1901.83s -> 1912.76s]  I did a test. I have one already installed. I did a test. I did a test. Okay. Let's go.
[1914.20s -> 1920.50s]  I downloaded one to test and we're just going to play it. Oh, fuck. Yeah. I'm excited. Let's do it.
[1920.50s -> 1927.82s]  Before the stream started, I wanted to make sure it worked. You know what? Sucks.
[1927.82s -> 1933.08s]  So before the stream started, I tested it. I got it set up. I'm going to have it like this,
[1933.82s -> 1939.02s]  check it, install. Okay. That works. I press the fucking goddamn stream button.
[1939.75s -> 1950.39s]  Steve is offline for an hour. Okay. No more resident sleepers. Are you going to make me
[1950.39s -> 1956.98s]  very upset? All right. The one that I downloaded to test, hopefully it's a good one. What should
[1956.98s -> 1967.77s]  be the best one of the night? Could be. Could be. This one's called Melatonin. We're going to try
[1967.77s -> 1975.37s]  it. Oh shit. I'm so glad I installed this one. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. No more
[1975.37s -> 1978.70s]  fucking around. I'm ready. We're going. We're already going. We're going. We're going. We're
[1978.70s -> 1992.31s]  going. Where is it? Got it. No, wake up. Oh, because the game's called Melatonin. Never mind.
[1992.31s -> 1998.04s]  All right. This is a demo. This is called Melatonin. Start the demo. Let's go. Let's go.
[2000.82s -> 2005.30s]  This game contains flashing effects like lights and colors that can affect player.
[2005.30s -> 2011.48s]  All right. So we got a warning here. We got a warning right off the bat. Just be
[2011.48s -> 2020.25s]  aware of that. So how does this work? Melatonin is a rhythm game that requires precise timing
[2020.25s -> 2027.90s]  for a dreamy experience. Make sure your sound is on and avoid using Bluetooth audio, bro, bro.
[2029.35s -> 2033.59s]  Okay. Let's start with the basics. Follow the rhythm and hit the space bar on beat with the
[2033.59s -> 2058.94s]  moving circles. You're lagging. I know. I don't know why my internet's fucked up right now.
[2069.16s -> 2074.07s]  The music made it worse for me. I don't know why. Why is my internet fucked up?
[2078.15s -> 2087.14s]  It's Twitch. No, it's, I don't think so. It is. It's the fiber optic cables. I think it's, it's
[2087.14s -> 2091.78s]  whatever. What am I going to do about it, guys? Okay. That didn't feel right. Not that right.
[2091.78s -> 2098.28s]  Let's do a quick tutorial. Recognize an audio and visual cues and reacting to them at the right time
[2098.28s -> 2105.30s]  according to the rhythm. For the first lesson, pay attention to the cues. They will be hinting
[2105.30s -> 2118.94s]  for you to react on the fourth beat when the circles overlap. That went in the circle. Every
[2118.94s -> 2122.70s]  level in the game will eventually expect you to follow the cues without the visual guide.
[2123.34s -> 2130.38s]  Wait, other streamers are having connection problems? Oh, that's annoying. Maintenance,
[2130.38s -> 2146.17s]  maintenance, maintenance, maintenance, maintenance, maintenance. Okay. Follow the
[2146.17s -> 2160.14s]  cues and react with the left and right arrow keys. Left and right arrow keys. Remember,
[2160.14s -> 2164.46s]  you're having maintenance. Yeah, it's called when you sleep. You have maintenance every single day.
[2164.46s -> 2170.17s]  Your brain does maintenance every day. Okay. There must be times when you need to start
[2170.17s -> 2174.25s]  and end your reaction at different times. Hold the spacebar on the third beat and let go on the
[2174.25s -> 2187.64s]  fourth. Oh, all right. That's kind of cool. Unique set of audio and visual cues. There's a practice
[2187.64s -> 2194.54s]  mode too. Cool. If it gets too hard, you can enable the assist options. Okay. That's the end
[2194.54s -> 2227.94s]  of the tutorial. Let's go. Well, this is like animated. What the hell? Whoa. It's an RPG.
[2228.58s -> 2234.02s]  Oh my God, guys. It's an RPG. I look probably crazy. Fuck. I hate cameras. I don't want a camera
[2234.02s -> 2248.52s]  in my house. I fucking hate this. What is this? Okay. This game is called Melatonin, by the way.
[2248.52s -> 2251.72s]  The demo is available on Steam whenever the maintenance ends.
[2257.14s -> 2317.75s]  I like it. Oh shit. It's games like Rhythm Heaven. Yeah. What? All right. Let's do it. Score mode.
[2317.75s -> 2324.87s]  This is fun. Yeah. I would just keep it on games and demos because we're going to be doing a lot
[2324.87s -> 2355.91s]  of them. So, all right, this is cool. I actually like this. Let's do it. Burger. It's not cat puke
[2355.91s -> 2432.73s]  simulator. Shit. This is fucking cool. This is a good one. This is a good one. It's like Rhythm
[2433.69s -> 2442.14s]  Heaven. What are we doing out of five? This one's Melatonin. I'm going to give you a rating on it
[2442.14s -> 2450.94s]  once we can confirm with me that Steam demos are currently downloading for people. How is it? I
[2451.02s -> 2465.11s]  think I might need a little bit more time with it. I think. Happy birthday to my friend Aaron.
[2465.11s -> 2470.39s]  Happy birthday, Aaron. The internet sucks. I don't know what's going on. Twitch's servers are fucked.
[2470.39s -> 2478.07s]  All right. Cool. That was cool. So, let's go. There's another one too. I want to do the other one.
[2480.12s -> 2494.68s]  The demo has what? Probably two, three levels. Whoa. This internet is really making me angry.
[2494.68s -> 2542.42s]  Oh, what the hell? Sick. I'm going to get 100 on this one. Use the chip. Yeah. And then
[2542.50s -> 2551.70s]  freak out because you want to get it out of the machine before it makes the sound.
[2553.38s -> 2562.97s]  It's like here it is. It's in there. Please remove card. Got it. And if it goes through one cycle of
[2564.33s -> 2572.34s]  you fucked up and you're really embarrassed and like it's an anxiety time. What? Just buy it. Wait,
[2572.34s -> 2591.27s]  what's going on? Restart. Is this right? Oh, I got it. And it's almost like I can tell when somebody's
[2591.27s -> 2600.94s]  judging the amount of as I had. Pause it so I can talk. I've put it in there before at the
[2600.94s -> 2608.14s]  grocery store, at Target, whatever. Best Buy doesn't matter. And you put a bag into the cart
[2608.14s -> 2615.26s]  and you hear, oh fuck. The second time it's like you fucked up, right? The second time it's like
[2615.26s -> 2620.63s]  that was you caused that problem. And if it happens a third time, it's almost like you can
[2620.63s -> 2631.86s]  feel the entire store all at the same time looking like get your fucking card. I hate it.
[2631.86s -> 2639.19s]  Yeah, I hate it. I don't like it. I make it like a nice sound, right? If the sound wasn't
[2639.19s -> 2667.08s]  like an iPhone alarm, I'm sure it would be fine. But restart, restart, restart. I get it. Oh,
[2667.08s -> 2684.30s]  Jeremy explaining. Imagine you were so rich that you buying millions of dollars in merchandise
[2687.03s -> 2693.34s]  is a fucking mini game. Can you imagine sitting there and they're like, wait, wait, hold on.
[2694.06s -> 2738.15s]  Be like, you're a dick. You're a fucking asshole. I would not do that. Still can't download demos.
[2747.99s -> 2755.85s]  Jerma does this at Applebee's. What does that even mean? I don't know. I don't know what that
[2755.85s -> 2764.95s]  means. I'm trying. I went after you said that I thought it was funny. But then at the same time,
[2764.95s -> 2770.97s]  I'm like, what is that person talking about? You get a bill at the very end. Does that mean
[2770.97s -> 2777.83s]  that I'm leaving and coming back and just, Hey, can you charge more breadsticks? Can I have another
[2777.83s -> 2782.71s]  bloom and onion? I just want to, you don't even swipe. They take your card and walk away with it.
[2788.82s -> 2800.57s]  Maybe I should try changing his Twitch servers. I might try that stream is going to turn off
[2800.57s -> 2822.52s]  potentially, but we'll see if it doesn't get better. I'll try a different server. It looks
[2822.52s -> 2849.69s]  like we're dropping 2% of all frames. I don't like that. This game's really cool. I love rhythm
[2849.69s -> 2869.11s]  heaven. And this is a rhythm heaven game for PC. Let's go. Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[2875.64s -> 2904.70s]  The game is called melatonin on steam. It's a demo available. This is the steam demo day early.
[2910.42s -> 2974.07s]  Wait, shoot. Where? Oh, melatonin. The game is melatonin. Should I put it in like the title or
[2974.07s -> 2979.54s]  something? All right, I'm going to try. Okay, here we go. I'm going to let me see something here.
[2979.54s -> 2990.12s]  Let me I gotta test something. I'm gonna see. Let me do this. I'm gonna see if I can change
[2990.12s -> 2993.40s]  Twitch server because last time this problem happened when Twitch was having server problems,
[2993.96s -> 2998.98s]  I switched to a different server and I found one that worked. So you want to try it? I think I
[2998.98s -> 3006.14s]  could try it. I'm dropping a lot of frames, 2.5% of every frame. I'll try that. Games are now
[3006.14s -> 3011.45s]  downloadable. Perfect. So let's restart. Let's just redo the stream, right? I haven't even gone live
[3011.45s -> 3018.55s]  yet. Let's just pretend I haven't gone live yet. You know what I'm saying? Okay, let's see.
[3019.74s -> 3026.42s]  What's it? Let me check. He's late. Yeah, just pretend I was late. Just tell everybody I was
[3026.42s -> 3041.32s]  late today by a lot. Let me see if this helps. Yeah, honestly, just pretend I was late. And by
[3041.32s -> 3045.24s]  the way, I'm going to be really mad if one person is not here when I come back in like a minute and
[3045.24s -> 3050.81s]  a half. Let me try this. Let me see if this helps. I'll be right back. Give me two seconds.
[3050.81s -> 3101.91s]  It's going to restart. Try a different server. Fuck. Fuck. I'll be right back. Let's see if it
[3101.91s -> 3107.93s]  worked. I went to a different server. I'm sorry I'm wicked late. Oh, hold on. Let me do the...
[3107.93s -> 3117.46s]  No, who cares about the intro? No, it didn't work. Didn't work. Got worse. Fuck. No. Oh, come on.
[3117.46s -> 3139.98s]  Really? Oh, come on. We're just gonna have to deal with the other server because now it's worse.
[3141.88s -> 3144.28s]  Maintenance! Maintenance! Maintenance! Maintenance! Maintenance! Maintenance! Maintenance!
[3144.28s -> 3187.27s]  Maintenance! I'll be right back again. We're just gonna have to deal with it. I think I'm not dropping
[3187.27s -> 3191.34s]  any more frames. I don't want to jinx it. I don't want to say it out loud. I don't want to say this
[3191.34s -> 3200.89s]  out loud. I think we're good. I ran a speed test. I tested to Twitch. I picked individual servers.
[3200.89s -> 3212.92s]  I went one by one by one. I think I got the right one. Fucking maintenance. All right. Give me a
[3212.92s -> 3217.10s]  second. I think we're good. I'm going to move a couple things around. We're not going to do
[3217.10s -> 3226.50s]  a starting screen because we already did that. Round two. That's right. Clueless. We'll see.
[3226.50s -> 3234.98s]  I'm actually kind of concerned, but whatever. He's on Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi Andy. Look at this beard.
[3235.94s -> 3241.83s]  Okay, you know those things? Where's the magnet and you drag the weird magnet hair
[3241.83s -> 3257.35s]  around the guy's face? I have magnet shavings and facial hair right now. Why am I weird looking?
[3257.35s -> 3263.56s]  What is it? Let's see. It's definitely like here and like here. You know what I mean?
[3269.67s -> 3277.90s]  Somebody said, yeah. Yeah. That's your face. I know. I'm just kidding. Welcome back, everybody.
[3277.90s -> 3283.16s]  Welcome to the show. I'm not going to tweet this stream out yet because I'm afraid to.
[3287.98s -> 3296.23s]  What's my... What's my... Why am I... I'm changing... I'm like white balance all fucked up.
[3296.23s -> 3311.80s]  Is this guy Morbius? It's the hair flip in the back. Yeah. I'm going to go line by line here.
[3311.80s -> 3319.16s]  Is this a secret stream? No. This is supposed to be a regular stream, but I got cut off a couple
[3319.16s -> 3330.55s]  hours ago trying to find a way back into the stream. And here we are. You look tired. Yeah,
[3330.55s -> 3341.90s]  tired of this shit. Tuesday maintenance on every fucking website. I'm tired of this shit. I'll
[3341.90s -> 3354.28s]  tell you that. Searching across the nation for a server I can stream to on Twitch. Late night
[3354.28s -> 3357.24s]  stream. Yeah. Well, it goes long. I don't want to go too, too long. I just want to... I wanted to
[3357.24s -> 3365.26s]  stream today. I'm so busy, right? I'm really busy. Today, I wanted to stream today and tomorrow.
[3366.06s -> 3370.25s]  I'm trying to sprinkle streams in when I can while working on the projects and stuff.
[3370.73s -> 3375.27s]  I wanted to stream today. Why do your sideburns look like pubes?
[3387.42s -> 3403.51s]  Dude, I don't know. I haven't had a haircut in... Oh, man. You freak me out. I'm going to cut these
[3403.51s -> 3412.28s]  right now. That is weird. Anyways, whatever. You're self-conscious? No, I'm really not. I'm
[3412.28s -> 3418.34s]  very comfortable in my... I'm very comfortable with my own skin. I promise. I don't care.
[3418.34s -> 3436.23s]  You should sell your hair. The fuck are you talking about? No. Never. Are you wearing a
[3436.23s -> 3440.23s]  powdered wig? That'd be kind of funny if I was. All right. No drop frames. I think we're good to
[3440.23s -> 3446.01s]  go. I think we're ready. I wonder, is it because... Is my hair going back further on this side than
[3446.01s -> 3453.59s]  it is on this side? No, it's not. It's just the way that my hair sits. Because when it gets really
[3453.59s -> 3458.71s]  long like this, it sits weirdly. It makes my head look like it's going back this way a little bit.
[3458.71s -> 3469.61s]  He's balding. I mean, yeah. I'm 36. You wouldn't... Yeah, you dream you look like this when you're 36.
[3469.61s -> 3477.86s]  You dream. Keep dreaming you'll look as good as I do right now at 36. Keep dreaming. Wait, let me
[3477.86s -> 3495.26s]  say that again when it looks better. Do not say F, liar. Don't do that. It's more like a nightmare.
[3497.99s -> 3512.34s]  Okay. Okay. There's no F. I'm looking at it right now. I can see there's no drop frames.
[3512.34s -> 3518.82s]  All 5,000 of us. Holy shit. What was just happening there? Can I get it to stay there?
[3529.05s -> 3541.70s]  Why does this look good? What's happening right now? This looks good. Why? Again, I got to get
[3541.70s -> 3547.48s]  away from... I'm just being an ego weirdo looking into a mirror. Because right now,
[3547.48s -> 3553.48s]  because I'm just sitting here, my OBS preview is right in front of my eyes. Usually it's over
[3553.48s -> 3563.46s]  here and I can't see it. Why does this look good? Am I fucking crazy or does this look good? This
[3563.46s -> 3575.22s]  looks good. Do I look good? This looks good, right? What's happening? Yeah, this looks fucking good.
[3575.22s -> 3586.15s]  Can you please say I'm gonna... No. You guys don't even... Sony put Morbius back in the theaters and
[3586.15s -> 3591.32s]  none of you assholes went to go see it. So no, I'm not going to do that. You didn't even see the
[3591.32s -> 3607.22s]  movie. All right. I think we're good. Let me tweet this out. Let me tweet this out. You changed? No,
[3607.22s -> 3622.06s]  I didn't. You did. New tweet that's going to say, trying again. I wanted to fucking stream. We're
[3622.06s -> 3628.47s]  going to try the game demos. It seems to be that Steam is back. Please back up. I'm typing on my
[3628.47s -> 3638.60s]  phone. Relax. Should be trying again with a bunch of like the crazy, like the face like, I'm crazy,
[3638.60s -> 3647.82s]  whatever, that emote, whatever it's called. What's that called? What is that? What is that
[3647.82s -> 3660.15s]  emote? What's that emoji called? It's called Zany. I was very upset before. I'm sorry, but I was.
[3660.15s -> 3673.42s]  How can a streamer stream without a proper internet, a proper server to connect to? It's
[3673.42s -> 3680.57s]  annoying. It's like a surgeon going in for surgery and they're just like, oh hey, yeah, you ready to
[3680.57s -> 3690.10s]  do your surgery? Yes, I'm ready. Oh, well, there are no tools. You have to use your bare hands.
[3690.10s -> 3703.16s]  I guess I'm just going to go home. He's comparing himself to a surgeon. I'm not comparing myself to
[3703.16s -> 3709.96s]  a surgeon. I'm just saying that the tools that I need to be able to stream, if they're not here,
[3709.96s -> 3716.39s]  I can't stream. Stop looking at yourself. Stop it. I got to get this off. Get away. I just like,
[3716.39s -> 3721.11s]  what's wrong with me? What's that? Is there a bird or an animal that like, if it looks at its
[3721.11s -> 3726.98s]  reflection, it just can't, it just sits there for an hour. I'm not even egotistical about this. I
[3726.98s -> 3730.90s]  just sometimes locked into this guy talking in front of me right over here. This guy in front
[3730.90s -> 3744.81s]  of me is talking and I'm looking at him. Okay, let's go. Okay. What's the title? The title should
[3744.81s -> 3752.39s]  probably be different, right? I would imagine. Let's get, oh, that's right. I want to move this
[3752.39s -> 3759.62s]  down. All right. So I got called to the limb. We're going to try that. This is the demo stream
[3759.62s -> 3764.74s]  and I might just do this tomorrow too, because I want to be able to do it tomorrow rather than
[3764.74s -> 3769.83s]  just kind of, I don't know how long the stream is going to be, but I couldn't go out on that bad one
[3769.83s -> 3780.52s]  a few hours ago. Not going to happen. Okay. Put that here. Now I need, what do I need? Okay.
[3782.54s -> 3791.69s]  All right. So I need, where's my discord? Where the hell is that? There it is. Okay. And then I
[3791.69s -> 3801.06s]  need this website. Give me one sec. All right. So I'm going to open up a call to the lamb. That's
[3801.06s -> 3807.35s]  the first one that I downloaded. If you don't know what we're doing, I will give you another look.
[3807.35s -> 3815.58s]  On steam, there is this huge list of demos that are available for the next week. Every single,
[3815.58s -> 3818.94s]  there's a thousand of these. They're all coming soon. Most of them are, and you can download
[3818.94s -> 3825.69s]  demos of them. I'm going to pick random shit here and we're just going to see how it goes.
[3825.69s -> 3828.41s]  We've already, that game melatonin was really cool and I want to keep doing this. I think it's a
[3828.41s -> 3835.88s]  really fun idea. So we're going to start with call to the lamb. I already have it installed
[3835.88s -> 3846.81s]  because I knew I was going to be doing it. So let's get it open, see if it's any good.
[3849.24s -> 3861.93s]  This game looks cute. We'll find out, won't we? And three, two, one, go. Massive monster. So what's
[3861.93s -> 3867.00s]  this game about? It's a demo. We're going to find out. Is it too loud? Can you hear anything?
[3869.24s -> 3880.55s]  That's not what I wanted to do. Yeah, I know. I do. Who cares about your desktop background?
[3880.55s -> 3887.54s]  Do you really care? It's nice. It's like a beach with, it's, it's, I don't care. I don't need,
[3887.54s -> 3893.91s]  I don't need a desktop background. It's cool. I don't care. I don't look at my desktop background.
[3893.91s -> 3904.63s]  I don't care. Press X. Wait, X as in X or X as in, is it basic background? Yeah, you don't need
[3904.63s -> 3923.56s]  anything more than that. Is it too dank? Is it? Okay. You stop being a minimalist. I don't have a
[3923.56s -> 3926.60s]  desktop background. It doesn't make me a minimalist. All right. This is, what is this game called?
[3927.40s -> 3935.29s]  Cult of the Lamb demo. Let's check it out. This is a controller game for sure. Guaranteed, right?
[3940.12s -> 3946.25s]  Okay. All right. I like the style so far. Work in progress. Okay. Let's go.
[3948.28s -> 3963.69s]  This is, this is cool looking so far. So far it's a five out of five. Magicka Wizard Wars.
[3964.49s -> 3974.28s]  Mousepad Andy. Really? Really? No, don't fucking derail this. I just got it started. I just was
[3974.28s -> 3982.02s]  able to get it to go live. I'm not derailing it already. It was two hours of derailment last time.
[3982.66s -> 3995.46s]  Kneel to be sacrificed. Okay. For this sacrifice, the prophecy will be impossible to fulfill.
[3996.18s -> 4001.30s]  The heretic lies bound below will be condemned to eternal captivity, and the old faith shall
[4001.30s -> 4022.84s]  be preserved. Oh, these are old gods. Am I dead? Is this game like Binding of Isaac? What's this
[4022.84s -> 4035.22s]  game like? Come closer if you're not. Though you are already dead, I still have need of you.
[4035.94s -> 4039.54s]  Those foolish bishops thought they could keep you from me in death, but instead they sent you
[4039.54s -> 4047.32s]  straight to me. I will give you life again, but at a price. All I ask is you just start a cult in
[4047.32s -> 4055.99s]  my name. Do we have a deal? Um, you're sure. Wise choice. Take the red crown which I once wore with
[4055.99s -> 4059.59s]  it. You shall command the loyalty of followers and strike fear into the hearts of our enemies.
[4059.59s -> 4065.75s]  By the way, this is called Cult of the Lamb demo. What am I doing? That was weird. That was weird.
[4067.19s -> 4070.39s]  I don't know what that was. That was very fucking weird. That was strange.
[4072.06s -> 4083.42s]  Once you've done so, you'll see me again. All right, so I let the old god out,
[4083.42s -> 4087.21s]  put the old god's crown on, and now I have the power of the old god. Remember,
[4087.21s -> 4095.38s]  this is Cult of the Lamb demo. What's wrong with you? A lot of things, man. Where do you want me
[4095.38s -> 4144.36s]  to start? Whoa. This game suck. All right. Okay. If you're not, I am Rato. I was once a chosen
[4144.36s -> 4149.74s]  vessel like you, but those days are lost to the winds. I was sent to guide you where deep in the
[4149.74s -> 4152.46s]  lands of the old faith and engraved danger. This game is actually really fun so far.
[4154.57s -> 4157.85s]  Lead you to safety. Continue through the woods. Escape lies ahead. I'll be close by.
[4158.65s -> 4165.88s]  Yeah, so this is again for everybody that's joining us. These are all demos on Steam right
[4165.88s -> 4173.58s]  now for games that may or may not be coming out soon. There's a whole event. Would have loved to
[4173.58s -> 4187.51s]  have been doing this all day. Yeah, so it is kind of like minding my inventory. Coin. Is it currency?
[4187.51s -> 4208.54s]  Those are probably traps, right? Do I have a health bar? One coin. I got two coins. I love
[4208.54s -> 4212.62s]  the art style. It's kind of like this kind of pop-up book. That's really cool. I like it.
[4213.34s -> 4240.31s]  Who's the composer? I don't know. Good question. This is good. It feels very clean. I would say it
[4240.31s -> 4249.59s]  controls exceptionally well. Exceptionally well. The movement's fun. It's very fluid. Animations
[4249.59s -> 4265.83s]  look great. There's no screen shake, which by the way, why God, why God, God, why does every
[4265.83s -> 4275.66s]  fucking game studio now put screen shake in every single game? Why is it in every game?
[4277.18s -> 4309.11s]  Why is it there? I can't stand this new trend. I can't take it. No, it's not here. Hold on now.
[4309.11s -> 4318.97s]  Hold on a second. Everybody wait. They, why is it in every game? I don't get this. I downloaded and
[4318.97s -> 4326.04s]  started to play, just because I was curious, Diablo Immortal. And let me just be very clear
[4326.04s -> 4336.78s]  about this. Fuck that game. Fuck that game. For a reason that you might not understand.
[4336.78s -> 4344.25s]  Every time you swing the weapon in Diablo Immortal as a melee character, a default swing,
[4347.67s -> 4358.70s]  your fucking iPad shakes. You can't turn it off. It drives me crazy, crazy. I'll sit,
[4359.50s -> 4367.72s]  it hurts my eyes just watching the screen shake. And I do this thing a lot of times where I type
[4367.72s -> 4374.12s]  into Google Diablo Immortal screen shake sucks, just to get the confirmation bias from myself
[4374.12s -> 4389.98s]  that other people agree with me. And I can't find it. I can't find it. Nobody agrees with me. Turn
[4389.98s -> 4400.02s]  those off too. But man, I don't know. Screen shake doesn't add anything. It's just annoying.
[4402.07s -> 4406.23s]  It's annoying. It doesn't add anything to the game. It's just obnoxious. I don't,
[4406.23s -> 4423.77s]  am I crazy? Have I lost my mind? He's a boomer. No, I am not. I am not a boomer.
[4423.77s -> 4430.14s]  It's a screen shake in every game now. I never remember a time when I used to play game. Okay,
[4430.14s -> 4437.94s]  this is, I just said used to whatever, where I had to turn a slider down. So my monitor didn't
[4438.02s -> 4454.20s]  shake. Oh, I hated it. Everyone's talking about Diablo Immortal's like pay to win bullshit.
[4455.24s -> 4478.26s]  I am like the screen shakes and I uninstalled it. Cool. We've reached safety. You've done well.
[4479.06s -> 4487.16s]  Okay. Someone tell him his monitor doesn't shake physically. I think he's afraid of damaging his
[4487.16s -> 4501.61s]  computer. I want to add screen shake to my streams. Let's see how you guys like it.
[4502.73s -> 4509.05s]  Every time I talk loud, the edges of your visual is going to go like this, like this.
[4512.14s -> 4527.26s]  I don't get it. This game. All right. This one's good. We're going to get this one five more
[4527.26s -> 4539.91s]  minutes. Oh, also Diablo more. Oh, do I even really? I mean, everybody's already had their
[4539.91s -> 4543.11s]  take of this game so far. Do I really have to add myself to the takes of Diablo Immortal?
[4544.26s -> 4548.02s]  Do I have to give you my Diablo Immortal take? I mean, you've heard everybody's given their take
[4548.02s -> 4550.74s]  every single person. You don't need to be, I don't have to give it to you, but I might.
[4553.35s -> 4558.23s]  Okay. All right. I will. There are 15 items in Diablo Immortal that are there. There are literally
[4558.23s -> 4566.20s]  15 items in the game, whatever it is. It's just like you run these rifts to get the same like 15
[4566.20s -> 4577.05s]  gems. There are 15 items in the whole game. All the other stuff. I don't know. Who cares?
[4577.05s -> 4595.24s]  Let the anger flow through you. Speak. Speak. Okay. So I got a follower. Indoctrinate into cult.
[4600.25s -> 4614.14s]  What? Wait, you make, you can make your own like cult members? Why? I want the pig. Variant?
[4618.71s -> 4623.59s]  Just say microtransactions are bad. That's that's really not even what I mean, though. I just mean
[4623.59s -> 4630.74s]  that there are actually like 13 or 14 items in the game that you try to get. The whole time I was
[4630.74s -> 4635.70s]  playing through the portions Diablo Immortal, just on my iPad, because I'm an iPad gamer.
[4635.70s -> 4638.90s]  I'm just sitting there going like none of this other gear. I don't care. Like this gear doesn't
[4638.90s -> 4645.88s]  matter. I'm just opening a box at the end of a dungeon and hoping that one like a five star
[4645.88s -> 4651.74s]  version of the same 15 items shows up. It was just, it just ruined everything. I was like this,
[4651.74s -> 4659.38s]  this is this is ruining the entire experience for me. Okay, I can give, can I change these?
[4660.66s -> 4665.06s]  Lose minus five faith whenever another follower dies or ignore dissenters when they preach.
[4665.62s -> 4683.08s]  Minus five faith when a follower is sacrificed. Huh. Okay. Chop trees? Okay. Wait, what?
[4685.64s -> 4689.16s]  Your cult will grow powerful, but your followers cannot live on prayer alone. They must eat.
[4689.88s -> 4700.39s]  This game's sick. How come Jerma is at a different hue right now? Because I don't know, man. I'm tired.
[4701.19s -> 4724.98s]  Okay. Build. Build it. Collect. Oh, I have to do it myself. Okay. I can't chop that tree down.
[4725.54s -> 4730.76s]  Wait, is that progress bar that small? Why did I pick the biggest tree at the camp?
[4733.16s -> 4751.40s]  That was stupid. Okay, I'll do that one later. Cool. No, but like, okay, micro transactions.
[4753.54s -> 4758.66s]  Look, I'm not going to sit here and go off on micro transactions. You've heard everybody give
[4758.66s -> 4766.71s]  that take. My take is get screen shake out of your fucking video games. That's the most important
[4766.71s -> 4803.98s]  takeaway. Stop talking. I'm a live streamer, man. Can I help? Okay, so let's build it.
[4805.45s -> 4809.21s]  This is supposed to be demo night, but this game is good. All right, I'm going to move on a minute.
[4809.21s -> 4820.42s]  We're going to do one more minute or this is how I'll end it. If you're going to have screen shake,
[4821.14s -> 4830.23s]  please be like these god tier developers and make it so I can turn it off. Be like these god tier
[4830.23s -> 4841.72s]  devs that knew and they decided to make it available if you turn it off. The demo is just 30
[4841.72s -> 4846.52s]  minutes. All right, cool. The followers need to eat. It's up to you to provide meals for them.
[4847.08s -> 4852.41s]  The hunger of your cult can be seen in the top left of the screen. When this gets low,
[4852.41s -> 4859.40s]  followers will begin to starve. Find more food while crusading. Pick routes that pass through
[4859.40s -> 4864.63s]  foraging locations. Plant farms to grow your own food. Seems to be purchased while crusading.
[4865.51s -> 4883.88s]  Like berries? When is this going to come out? I want to play this. Oh, I have to hold it. All
[4883.88s -> 4898.52s]  right, you can cook food. I only have one follower so far. What's this game called? This game is
[4898.52s -> 4906.28s]  called Cult of the Lamb. Cult of the Lamb. So far so good. Okay, let's cook some food.
[4912.95s -> 4923.86s]  15% chance of the follower pooping instantly. That's weird. What'd I just do? What'd I just do?
[4924.58s -> 4942.60s]  Oh. Oh wait. Okay. So is that pig going to eat this? I need more followers.
[4945.58s -> 4955.58s]  Okay. Slay them. Go find gold and find recruits. All right, this game's cool.
[4955.58s -> 4971.06s]  Yep, this is a good one. Kill M. Deuceous. One follower Andy. Hey, you gotta start somewhere.
[4971.70s -> 4982.60s]  You gotta start somewhere. You don't just wake up one day with... How many followers do I have? 50?
[4984.71s -> 5011.22s]  Okay, Darkwood. All right, I guess we're just going to Darkwood, right? Who made this game? I have to
[5011.22s -> 5019.16s]  read this. Jerma, if you were dreaming right now, would you show us your penis? You know how many
[5019.16s -> 5024.36s]  times I've panicked in my dreams about something like that happening? Why would I do that deliberately
[5024.36s -> 5039.30s]  in my dream? Mods let that pass. No, I caught it before it got deleted. Would you stop? All right.
[5039.86s -> 5047.45s]  Oh, items. Quiet. You didn't have to read that. That person needs to know. They need to be corrected.
[5048.01s -> 5066.97s]  Okay, I want this one. Hell yeah. Let's go. Wait, I take them both? Dude, you take them both.
[5076.95s -> 5092.04s]  Whoa, this is good. Oh yeah, this is a fun game. This is a fun one. Absolutely. Put this one on
[5092.04s -> 5118.26s]  your wish list for sure. Hell yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What is this? Praise Lamb, conduit to great power,
[5118.26s -> 5124.42s]  promise liberator of the one that waits below. So the card showed me once many lifetimes ago,
[5124.42s -> 5129.30s]  or has that yet to be. I always have drawn your cards, Lamb, and yet this is the first.
[5129.30s -> 5132.74s]  Take these cards and I will draw another each time we meet. When drawn by me, they will grant
[5132.74s -> 5136.82s]  you a power. A power that's both known and unfathomable. The cards they shall decide.
[5146.68s -> 5157.67s]  I think this one. Yeah, whatever. Okay, cool. Got it. Tarot cards. Oh, these ones I have unlocked.
[5157.67s -> 5173.83s]  All right. I only have three hearts. Everybody be careful. Oh, there's food. Nice. Nice. Does
[5173.83s -> 5197.02s]  this get the German 985 stamp of approval? Yes. What's going on? Whoa, what? How can this be?
[5197.58s -> 5202.62s]  You were put to the blade, Lamb, as all your kind were, and yet here you stand before me,
[5202.62s -> 5210.34s]  unrepentant. The crown has power, could it be? But I am stronger still, turn tail and run little Lamb.
[5211.06s -> 5232.31s]  Leshy, wait, inscription? Interesting. Okay, inscription. All right, everybody show of hands.
[5232.31s -> 5236.63s]  How many people listen to the angler's theme song at least once every couple of weeks?
[5237.51s -> 5247.10s]  And just sit there in your chair and go like, let's do the question mark.
[5248.87s -> 5268.66s]  Whoa, that's a good room to go in. The angler from inscription. One of the bosses.
[5274.47s -> 5281.18s]  You guys don't know what the angler theme song from inscription is? How dare you show up here?
[5281.66s -> 5302.17s]  Play it. I'll play it after this. I'm going to die. I got to be a better gamer than this.
[5312.81s -> 5317.80s]  I'm kind of sad that this is just a demo. I want to play the rest of this game.
[5317.80s -> 5336.66s]  All of these different weapons. Pogjam.
[5345.27s -> 5354.31s]  When slaying a foe, I'm talking. When slaying foe, summon a ghost that will attack nearby enemies.
[5354.31s -> 5364.06s]  Cool. Projectile that spreads. What? Should I try this? This is a projectile.
[5369.83s -> 5380.46s]  You can recycle stuff too. What does recycle mean? Wait, what? Oh, that's cool.
[5381.02s -> 5405.54s]  It's just huge range. All right, recycle it. Ah, it's money. Got it. Nice. Nice. Press Y.
[5406.10s -> 5427.70s]  Yeah, I've been wasting it like a fool. Oh, it puts that tar on the ground. All right,
[5427.70s -> 5440.66s]  I got to kill the boss. Bat chest. Flower necklace. Oh, I think this is the boss.
[5441.30s -> 5467.35s]  Let's go. How do I build up the meter? This game rocks. It does. I would have moved on
[5467.35s -> 5502.97s]  a long time ago. I want to see this demo to the end. Land the 1C3 combo. Oh, that one. What hit
[5502.97s -> 5512.76s]  me? Are we dropping frames? Nope. Good. So, see what I mean? It's just so fucking weird. It makes
[5512.76s -> 5524.44s]  no sense. You've gone far enough. My followers are willing to do anything for me. Can you say
[5524.44s -> 5530.49s]  the same of yours? I give myself to the cause, oh mighty leader. By the blood of the great ones,
[5530.49s -> 5577.30s]  destroy the red crown. Amdusius. Oh, wait, I can, I, really? Convert me to your cult,
[5577.30s -> 5589.54s]  I will follow your teachings faithfully. Ah, 13 berries, follower form, or berry bush,
[5589.54s -> 5610.34s]  berry bush, berry bush, berry bush, berry bush. That one. Very cool. My face is so itchy with this
[5610.34s -> 5620.12s]  beard. Locked. Return to cult. Is that it? Did I get to the end? Did I reach the end of the demo?
[5626.49s -> 5643.72s]  That's it? When does this come out? Oh, no. Ah, August 11th. All right, write that down and
[5643.72s -> 5648.58s]  put it in the recommended. I want to play this game. This game's cool. All right, what's next?
[5648.58s -> 5652.58s]  That was, that was cult of the land. Put it on your steam watch list. I would highly recommend it.
[5653.38s -> 5666.47s]  What else do I want to do? Do anger foot. Hold on. Let's, let's, I thought I just got electrocuted
[5666.47s -> 5676.55s]  for one second. I was like, I'm getting electrocuted. Uh, okay. So now let's go down here.
[5676.55s -> 5694.62s]  What do we got next? Anger. Hold on. Let me move this a little. Anger, anger foot. This looks pretty
[5694.62s -> 5708.97s]  good. This looks cool. Hold on. What else? Midnight fight express potion permit roots of Pacha
[5709.93s -> 5717.98s]  renowned. These all look, these all look wicked fun. What happened? Am I, do I just not pay
[5717.98s -> 5724.78s]  attention to anything or is this just a shitload of good games that they're curating? All right,
[5724.78s -> 5728.30s]  we'll do anger foot and I'm going to, I'll put on the, uh, the angler theme so you can understand
[5728.30s -> 5739.26s]  what I'm talking about. Anger foot is coming up. It's cause they're new. This is cool. I didn't know
[5739.26s -> 5744.52s]  it was going to be like this. Yeah. So people don't know what they're here. This is what I'm
[5744.52s -> 5758.55s]  talking about for those of you that need to know. The song is crazy. It's very, it's very simple,
[5758.55s -> 5766.46s]  but it gets, I just think it's cool. You ready? This is the one. This is the song I was talking
[5766.46s -> 5800.60s]  about. Play the Trapper song. I'm sorry. The Trapper song is not the angler.
[5801.40s -> 5808.68s]  That's not going to get played on my broadcast. I'm sorry. You're a psycho. What I, what, why?
[5811.58s -> 5820.34s]  Actually, that is like kind of weird, isn't it? Why am I listening to like scary jaws type music,
[5820.34s -> 5838.04s]  right? I'm listening to like a scary song. That's not the only thing I listened to.
[5838.04s -> 5844.07s]  The meat grinder calls. No, I, the whole soundtrack I listened to. I just think this one's really,
[5844.71s -> 5851.77s]  this one's really cool. I just, I just see the kind of scene play out where he's like at the
[5852.73s -> 5862.39s]  whatever. I don't care. I don't care. All right, let's go. You guys ready? I'm trying to get this
[5862.39s -> 5867.56s]  really streamlined here so we can make it very quick. Very, actually hold on a minute.
[5868.87s -> 5880.34s]  Where's my Twitch dashboard? Who took it? So we're going to do Angerfoot coming up here. Cool.
[5880.34s -> 5896.28s]  Oh, I am logged in. That's fine. Good. What is this title? Delayed, delayed demo day D stream
[5899.02s -> 5911.35s]  D stream. What is a D stream? Okay. Let's check it out. You guys saying this one's good. Let's
[5911.35s -> 5949.91s]  see if you're, if you're accurate. I know that this is devolver again is 92 high for this timer.
[5949.91s -> 5962.89s]  Is there already this timer already? Where am I going? Where am I going? Holy shit. This
[5962.89s -> 5990.95s]  game's fucking incredible. This game is amazing. Why don't these games come out? Am I just, do I
[5990.95s -> 5994.31s]  don't play video games? That was amazing. That was some of the most fun I've ever had in my life.
[5997.05s -> 6001.29s]  That was some of the most fun I've ever had in my entire life. In my entire life.
[6001.29s -> 6049.56s]  Okay, cool. Let's go. Let's do it. Level two. Oh, this is fucking crazy. I'm dead. Fuck. Why is he
[6049.56s -> 6097.18s]  twerking? I'm confused. How do I reload? No, give me that gun. How do you reload? Damn, this is good.
[6097.74s -> 6119.13s]  This game gives me a headache. Yeah, me too, but it's fun. I got it. I got it.
[6120.33s -> 6138.94s]  I gotta hold. Okay, don't shoot the gun. This screen shake. This, no, it's not, it's different.
[6140.66s -> 6145.70s]  Yeah, it is screen shake. I'm kicking doors into people's faces and I'm punching exploding walls.
[6146.82s -> 6165.70s]  Okay, I gotta get it right. I gotta hold. There it is. Why are they, what kind of toilet is that?
[6165.70s -> 6208.82s]  What? Where the fuck am I going? I don't know. Uh, what? Where do I go? Should I be doing this?
[6208.82s -> 6228.15s]  What? Oh, come on. What the hell is that? I don't even know what,
[6228.15s -> 6244.73s]  what direction am I supposed to be going? Oh shit. Oh, okay. This is cool. Again, this is called
[6244.73s -> 6263.53s]  Angerfoot. Okay, for a second. I thought, I thought I was naked. I'm not going to kick the
[6263.53s -> 6282.87s]  table over, am I? Oh, no, I don't want, this is, this is fucking weird. I'm just so bad.
[6294.70s -> 6298.86s]  Somebody said, put it, no, I, oh, I don't want to do that.
[6301.02s -> 6305.02s]  I don't want to do that. No, don't, don't do it. Don't do it. Oh,
[6305.02s -> 6322.26s]  no. Do I answer the phone? Hey, want some wine? Here, have some wine.
[6326.86s -> 6334.71s]  He's going to puke. I'm not going to puke. I can't, I'm trying to give the wine over here.
[6337.48s -> 6351.54s]  Oops. Do I have to pick it up with my foot? No, put the fucking popcorn down.
[6352.50s -> 6370.04s]  You'll regret interfering with the crime gang. Oh, this is fucking funny. Check your fax machine.
[6379.21s -> 6415.19s]  How am I breaking shit? I mean, I can't read it. This is so fucking weird. Oh shit.
[6441.40s -> 6457.85s]  This one's hard. Okay. Blow it up. Blow it up. Blow it up. That was pretty dank.
[6465.30s -> 6513.11s]  Oh, fuck you. Can you please smoke cigarettes on stream? What are you talking about?
[6513.91s -> 6550.71s]  What's wrong with you? What are you, why are you saying that? Come on out.
[6554.46s -> 6576.02s]  Oh, a secret. Oh my God. What am I doing? Why would I do that in reverse?
[6576.02s -> 6581.30s]  I should have done that the other way. Why did I do that that way? That was stupid. Dumbass.
[6630.90s -> 6652.02s]  What the fuck are you talking about? Shit. Oh, this game is so good. This is the best game ever.
[6652.02s -> 6655.06s]  It's so addicting. I can't stop. And then, and it's going to end soon. I know it.
[6656.50s -> 6691.19s]  Oh my God. Okay. This game is so good. I'm going to lose my mind. Yo, you, you weren't even close.
[6691.19s -> 6709.67s]  I'm addicted. Where's the other guy? Where's the other guy? Where's the other guy?
[6710.39s -> 6757.43s]  Where's the other guy? Fuck. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh, get out.
[6757.43s -> 6790.10s]  Holy shit. This is wild. How's everybody doing? You guys doing all right? New weapons.
[6813.93s -> 6827.99s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What's that? Drink soda. Oh my God. What is it?
[6830.90s -> 6846.01s]  Oh, I don't like to, I'm not drinking one of these ever again. I beat the level. This is like hot
[6846.01s -> 6855.69s]  light. Way too dank. Is it too dank? I'll turn it down. Is it too dank? Are we all right? We good?
[6861.43s -> 6879.08s]  Wait, I can change the tacky town? Whoa. Great for kicking doors and kicking ass.
[6879.08s -> 6887.53s]  Regain ammo with every kill. I'll take those. All right. So I get ammo with every kill.
[6888.68s -> 6896.02s]  Oh, new shoes. Nice. These look good. Wait, did I just do this?
[6904.28s -> 6913.05s]  I just did this. How come it's the same little turn it up louder. I'll think about it.
[6939.70s -> 6954.66s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh shit. Where am I going? Okay. So why did I do that twice?
[6960.33s -> 6975.72s]  Level five level. Oh, there we go. Level six. That's a grenade. Wait, where do I go? Oh,
[6975.72s -> 6981.96s]  I probably kicked the grenade back, right?
[7003.48s -> 7038.94s]  Huh? Huh? Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh shit. Okay. All right. All right. All right. I got it.
[7038.94s -> 7045.06s]  I got it. Do start over. Start over. Start over. Start over. Start over. Start over. Do it again.
[7045.06s -> 7048.50s]  Start over. Start over. Whatever. Don't start. Whatever. My nose is bleeding.
[7049.22s -> 7096.62s]  I got crushed. Let's go. I missed the days when you didn't do cocaine on stream. Turn the volume
[7096.62s -> 7105.18s]  back up. I know level seven. This is a pretty long demo. New gun. All right. This is what is.
[7108.50s -> 7117.59s]  Oh shit. All right. I'm going to die in one hit. You didn't deny. I don't do. I don't do drugs
[7117.59s -> 7146.17s]  besides Marrow marijuana enemy. Do you count Tylenol? He admitted to it. Yeah. I take Tylenol
[7146.17s -> 7162.90s]  sometimes. Who cares? Sometimes don't overdo it. No, no, no, no, no, no. Too many people.
[7188.66s -> 7247.00s]  Oh, come on. Please give me a break. Turn it back up. This sucks. Oh my goodness. Fine. Go.
[7255.99s -> 7265.70s]  The health. All right. I gotta be careful here. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on.
[7266.26s -> 7288.76s]  I missed the barrel. This game really has that one more time mentality on it.
[7289.32s -> 7303.19s]  What are you doing to me? What is going on? What the fuck? I keep dying. I keep exploding.
[7307.27s -> 7346.47s]  Oh my God. It's the barrel. Let's freaking go. I have an idea. Where's that pistol? All right.
[7346.47s -> 7352.66s]  I have an idea. Here's my idea. Ready? Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
[7352.66s -> 7379.54s]  run, run, run, run. Got it. Okay. Now where was my shotgun? I want my shotgun back. How do I get out
[7379.54s -> 7431.75s]  of here? Nice. Oh, this is the end of the demo. Probably right. No, I blew it. Fuck. That would
[7431.75s -> 7528.34s]  have been so cool if I got it. What? My computer. Holy shit. This game is so hard. Fuck. How did I
[7528.34s -> 7566.54s]  miss with every shot? What am I doing? Am I drinking? Is this alcohol? I don't know where
[7566.54s -> 7617.32s]  to go. There was no reason to do what I just did. That was stupid. What? What happened? That was
[7617.32s -> 7668.97s]  so clean. What was going on? What the hell happened? This game's fucking crazy, man.
[7709.94s -> 7745.24s]  Is he dead? All right. We're good. Okay. Now what keeps happening here? Seriously?
[7746.12s -> 7805.06s]  Okay. They blew up the whole room. Who cares? Go. Oh my God. My feet went in the air.
[7805.06s -> 7830.22s]  I like dove in there with two feet. Nice. Just seeing if I hear auto. Is that auto?
[7830.22s -> 7848.15s]  I've got like music blasting in my ears. It's kind of hard to hear. Damn. All right.
[7848.15s -> 7881.08s]  Those guys got shields. Okay, sirs. Blow it up. Blow it up. What the hell? Thank God. Oh my God.
[7881.88s -> 7920.71s]  This game is too fun. I can't stop playing it. That's the strategy right there. Oh, come on.
[7920.71s -> 7958.25s]  I almost got in. Fuck. I think Jerma is doing exactly what they would do. What? What's going
[7958.25s -> 7980.36s]  on? Why is it already freaking out? What's wrong? Am I hallucinating? No, I'm not. I don't think it's
[7980.36s -> 8059.19s]  talking shit. It's impossible. The game's impossible. I want a pistol. No, I don't want it.
[8059.19s -> 8082.30s]  Oh my goodness. There's a lot of people in that room. Oh my God. Does it matter? I don't get it.
[8083.18s -> 8152.41s]  Shit. What do I do? Fuck out of here. Level 10. This game is cracked out. I love it.
[8153.69s -> 8209.27s]  That guy exploded. Why did that guy explode? Whoa. He's got a machine gun. Give me that
[8209.27s -> 8225.38s]  shotgun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What's that? Nothing. Come on, computer. Stop lagging.
[8226.02s -> 8249.08s]  Not going to fool me with that bullshit. Give me the shotgun. I thought someone was just knocking
[8249.08s -> 8289.45s]  on my door. Oh, fuck. Oh my God. There's too many people. Holy shit. New shoes. All right,
[8289.45s -> 8301.00s]  we got to wait. We got new shoes. Blasters. Charge up a powerful long distance kick. I'll try it.
[8304.18s -> 8317.51s]  Wait more floaties. So soft. You feel like you're floating away. I kind of want to try these.
[8318.23s -> 8354.06s]  I think this is a boss level. Oh, it's somebody. Okay. Goop cop. What? I need a gun. Is there a gun?
[8377.54s -> 8414.71s]  Don't go off the edge. Oh boy. I went off the edge. Idiot. Oh shit. I got hit right in the head.
[8415.51s -> 8485.64s]  That was a good shot. Don't do it. Whoa. No. What the fuck? Why?
[8486.60s -> 8526.46s]  Okay. Stop it. Oh my God. All right. Back up. Back up. Back up. I need a hill.
[8527.26s -> 8565.06s]  Give me different shoes. I want different shoes. Floaties. Turn doors into bombs. All right.
[8567.26s -> 8585.34s]  How do these work? Whoa. Okay. That might actually be a problem. Wait, why are they all floating? Why
[8585.34s -> 8597.37s]  is everybody floating? Wait, everybody gets the shoes. Everybody gets them. I get it.
[8598.17s -> 8655.27s]  Does that work? Is that doing damage or no? No. All right. Don't be an idiot. There it is. Got it.
[8655.27s -> 8677.48s]  All right. Let's start with me a little. What? Oh God. What's going on? What's he dropping? Oh,
[8677.48s -> 8701.02s]  he's dropping bombs. Why will this not hurt you? Everybody's floating around. I don't know who's
[8701.02s -> 8737.03s]  alive. What the fuck? Don't hit me. All right. Is that it? Did I get it? Oh my God. There's a
[8737.03s -> 8748.97s]  phase three. They're just in a car now. Holy shit. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[8781.72s -> 8801.58s]  Don't even. Holy shit. That almost took my whole head off. That almost took off my head. Damn.
[8807.42s -> 8820.44s]  I mean, that was amazing. Can I get that a five? I think that one deserves a five. Yeah. That was
[8820.44s -> 8828.02s]  a demo. That demo was more fun than some whole games I've played. That's definitely a five. First
[8828.02s -> 8845.30s]  five of the night. Damn. Very cool. All right. What's next? Let's take a look. When does this
[8845.30s -> 8858.12s]  come out? That's a good question. 2023. All right. That's a little wait, but it'll be worth it.
[8858.76s -> 8869.93s]  That was phenomenal. Like straight up phenomenal. Okay. Let's go back and take a look at the list
[8869.93s -> 8876.22s]  here and see what else I want to try. Guys, should we just do this tomorrow too? I think we just do
[8876.22s -> 8890.90s]  this tomorrow to agent 64. Okay. This is actually really, really fun. I really like this a lot.
[8890.90s -> 8900.50s]  Okay. Agent six, this one here. I think I got it. Do I have this one already? Agent 64 spies never
[8900.50s -> 8909.99s]  die. I think I installed this one when I was kind of away for an hour. Agent 64. Let's give it a
[8909.99s -> 8930.97s]  try. Yeah. I think I pretty sure. Yeah. I got this one. I had this one already. All right. Agent 64
[8930.97s -> 8936.49s]  spies never die. Let's go for it. Agent one. Let's do options. Make sure there's no goddamn
[8936.49s -> 8956.82s]  screen shake. We're good. Wait. I'll keep it on for now. I'll keep all this on for now. Okay.
[8957.38s -> 8971.93s]  Let's give it a try. Story. Tower escape. Agent special agent or a 64 agent. Sims music. Let's
[8971.93s -> 8979.80s]  just do agent, right? What about special agent? Free civilian hostages access ground floor.
[8980.36s -> 8998.92s]  I'll try special agent. This is agent 64. All right. Reminds me of time crisis. Action.
[9008.92s -> 9016.79s]  Man, why these games are all so good. It's like golden eye. Yep. It's golden eye, right? Yep. Yep.
[9016.79s -> 9037.72s]  Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. You play as count Dooku in this game. You don't. Should I go? Where
[9037.72s -> 9044.18s]  should I go here? Elevators are locked. Press mouse to target and shoot the padlock. Yeah,
[9044.18s -> 9056.25s]  it is golden eye. Was that hostage? No, I was just trying to kick that guy in the face.
[9056.25s -> 9076.33s]  That was not going to work. Got it. This is fun to play too. This feels great.
[9077.29s -> 9106.95s]  Okay. So now where, where do I go from here? Is there a sprint? No, there's no sprint. It's
[9106.95s -> 9158.07s]  golden eye over over here. That's a little dank. Stop shooting. Stop it. Even the switch to the
[9158.07s -> 9175.19s]  decoder. Got it. Is there a crouch? It has to be right. This just is the facility from golden
[9175.19s -> 9179.11s]  eye. I remember because I used to replay this over and over again and I would just kind of hide
[9179.11s -> 9196.82s]  in the bathroom. How many guys treated the facility level or golden eye in general? Kind of like
[9197.46s -> 9205.90s]  a hitman game. It was kind of one of the first iterations of there's AI and then be careful,
[9205.90s -> 9224.12s]  hide from them. Oh God, I'm dead. Give me a different weapon quick. Why is everybody coming
[9224.12s -> 9232.68s]  out of the toilets with machine guns? Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Oh my God. I
[9232.68s -> 9238.12s]  fucked it up. I fucked it up so bad. All right. Last try. Last try. Last try. I'm going to move on.
[9240.18s -> 9258.65s]  I get it now. I understand what the game is. Dude, why do I have this distinct memory of golden eye
[9258.65s -> 9264.34s]  when you got to the end of the game and I remember unloading on that guy, the last boss,
[9264.34s -> 9275.91s]  and you can't kill him, but he took like 700 million bullets. That happened, right? Wait,
[9275.91s -> 9282.31s]  can't you kill that guy in a random place or something? And like the game kind of messes up
[9282.31s -> 9287.18s]  and the game doesn't like understand that you beat it because you killed the boss way too early
[9287.18s -> 9293.00s]  because you unloaded like a thousand bullets into his back or something. Why is this locked?
[9293.00s -> 9311.26s]  Did I not get the key card from somebody? I didn't have the tutorial to teach me how to play.
[9312.63s -> 9316.47s]  I forgot. I got this. It was like an hour since I last played this part.
[9316.47s -> 9349.82s]  Nice dodge. Can I do that move? Why would the box explode? All right. I almost have a ton of ammo
[9349.82s -> 9393.06s]  for this gun. I do. Here we go. I have a lot of bullets. Shut up. Ammo is so important. Okay.
[9393.06s -> 9405.72s]  Let's get that open. All right. Now don't blow this like an idiot. All right. Let me try to do
[9405.72s -> 9422.98s]  this stealthy so I don't get every single person in the whole room attacking me. Did that matter?
[9422.98s -> 9468.73s]  All right. All right. I need to help back so bad or I'm going to lose. Is there any health in here?
[9468.73s -> 9508.78s]  Come on, man. I'm going to die. I'm out of bullets. Abort mission immediately.
[9511.21s -> 9516.17s]  No, I'm not leaving. I can still get the flash drive with all the coordinates on it. Where the
[9516.17s -> 9544.25s]  hell it is? Got one. Immediately. Abort mission immediately. Excuse me. I'm not leaving until I
[9544.25s -> 9557.64s]  get the... I'm going to beat the level. German, stop playing this like angry foot. I mean, I kind
[9557.64s -> 9566.25s]  of have to. Please, I need it. It's important. Shoot a fire link habit. I need to know if a fire
[9566.25s -> 9573.21s]  link habit will explode if you shoot it. They do. There you go. What about the bureau? Yep. What
[9573.21s -> 9579.45s]  about the table? Yep. Everything explodes when you shoot it enough times. Okay. That's actually
[9579.45s -> 9609.50s]  pretty funny. How do I beat the level? I already failed. I can't progress anymore. This one was
[9609.50s -> 9615.18s]  really good though. I like this. All right. So that was Agent 64. It seems like a really close
[9616.46s -> 9622.22s]  retelling of a... Kind of like GoldenEye. I would say very much fun. Very fun game.
[9622.94s -> 9631.64s]  What am I... Did my head explode? All right. That was a very fun game. I like that one a lot. I would
[9631.64s -> 9639.11s]  give that one a four. I give that one a... I give that one a four out of five. All right. What else
[9639.11s -> 9646.68s]  can we do? Agency. That was really good. I really like that. Really fun. Let's take another look.
[9647.32s -> 9658.81s]  Let's take a look at the page here. Okay. I mean, the one that's featured is Metal Hellsinger.
[9658.81s -> 9666.84s]  Should I do that one? That one is featured right here on the front page here. What do you think?
[9666.84s -> 9683.86s]  Metal Hellslinger. Potion permit. Renown Metal Hellsinger. All right. I'll try it. This looks
[9683.86s -> 9696.46s]  pretty... This looks pretty cool. Is this a rhythm game? I don't know. Let's check it out. Would my
[9696.46s -> 9703.58s]  enjoyment and rating be better if it was offline? I don't think so. There are a lot of FPS games.
[9703.58s -> 9712.78s]  There are more here that are not FPS. This game potion permit looks really cute. Midnight Fight
[9712.78s -> 9722.73s]  Express. This looks kind of crazy. When am I going to get through all these? F. Yeah. The reason why
[9722.73s -> 9728.01s]  you're seeing F is because I'm downloading a game. So it's a fake F. It's not a real F. Don't worry.
[9729.51s -> 9746.15s]  It ain't real. Okay. So that was... Is this game going to be loud? I would assume. Probably right.
[9746.15s -> 9757.53s]  Potion permit next. Should you watch the streamer or watch Stranger Things? I mean, Stranger Things
[9757.53s -> 9765.11s]  is going to be available pretty much at any point. Whenever you want. You can open up Netflix and
[9765.11s -> 9774.06s]  watch Stranger Things anytime. I'm only here right now. I don't know. Stranger Things. Whatever. I
[9774.06s -> 9785.26s]  mean, season two to three was... Was that right? You know, whatever. It's okay. But I mean, season
[9785.90s -> 9796.62s]  four. We're getting to the end of the show and everything. It's all right. You haven't even
[9796.62s -> 9807.53s]  watched it. Nope. I saw 10 minutes of the first episode. All right. This is a double headphone
[9807.53s -> 9824.60s]  game, I think. Okay. I guess I'm going to accept the agreement. This looks good too. Video latency.
[9825.24s -> 9830.92s]  This is a rhythm game. I thought you guys were full of shit. This is a rhythm game.
[9831.56s -> 9852.46s]  The screen shake, right? Okay. It's fine. I definitely want to visit 90. Whatever. This is
[9852.46s -> 9867.13s]  fine. Let's try demo. This is Metal Hellsinger demo. Okay. Metal Hellsinger is automatically
[9867.13s -> 9873.90s]  configured to provide the best... That was really quickly speaking. Okay. If you're using wireless
[9873.90s -> 9879.26s]  headphones or the devices with high latency, I'm not. I'm wired. So I think I should be fine.
[9883.45s -> 9907.62s]  That sounded fake. Her coming to get me. I am. It's like a storm coming from far, far away.
[9908.42s -> 9923.37s]  I did not feel it in the air. Then me. You didn't do that to the beat. Didn't count.
[9932.68s -> 9956.86s]  Well, that's a wave. Let's get this shit out of me. That's still too high. That's still too high.
[9957.82s -> 9969.00s]  Holy shit, dude. A two, three. Okay. We're going with three sensitivity.
[9969.32s -> 10014.18s]  That's... I hated them. Is this a rhythm game? Okay. Okay. It has to be on beat. That wasn't on
[10014.18s -> 10031.30s]  beat? No, wait. Hold on a minute. Go get, go get, go get, go. Go get, go get, go get. I'm trying to
[10031.30s -> 10043.80s]  swing and hit when it lands. You know what I'm talking about? Because the sword will be landing
[10043.80s -> 10098.57s]  on beat. Go get, go get, go get. Tap E. Slaughter gives you life. Nice. Go get, go get, go get.
[10103.03s -> 10107.32s]  We didn't need words. We understood each other without them.
[10107.32s -> 10117.24s]  Guess it sounds like love at first sight, don't it? You see, the whole universe has a rhythm. Well,
[10117.24s -> 10127.98s]  it's... It's one, two, three, four. Not three, four, one, two, three, four. Sort of. This is
[10127.98s -> 10147.77s]  her voice. All right. Let's get it. Paz can be used for keeping fury up even without demons around.
[10148.41s -> 10277.43s]  Okay. Fury meter. We need perfect beats. Fury boost. Is this me singing? You can find all the
[10277.43s -> 10306.41s]  tutorial. Yeah. This is pretty... I like this one. This is cool. Mosh pit. Let's go. Enter hell.
[10306.41s -> 10318.73s]  So are these... This is actual music, right? This is actual songs. All right. Let's get a real taste
[10318.73s -> 10379.86s]  see if I like it. This is going to be a real test. Okay. I want to swing that fast. I get... All
[10379.86s -> 10386.90s]  right. Here's what I take. This kind of feels like doom if the doom guy got bored in the middle of
[10386.90s -> 10441.94s]  the game and he's making his own fun. That's not a bad thing. So many souls here makes a kind of
[10441.94s -> 10455.75s]  electricity. Music's really good too. Yeah. Every successful attack charges up weapons. Ultimate.
[10456.23s -> 10492.44s]  Fire the ultimate. Oh shit. All right. All right. Where do I go now?
[10501.96s -> 10659.16s]  This game is fucking phenomenal. Holy shit. 200k. How do I heal? Oh right. I know how to heal.
[10659.88s -> 10747.85s]  I forgot to blink. You're right. Let's go. I already know, man. I'm already a professional.
[10748.65s -> 10759.32s]  I only have to reload on the beat too. I just swallowed a bunch of spit. That was gross.
[10759.96s -> 10775.06s]  All right. Where do I go? I'm so locked in just playing the game. I don't know. I don't know what
[10775.06s -> 10793.45s]  direction I'm going. I'm going backwards. Where do I go? How did I turn around? I don't know.
[10793.45s -> 10800.52s]  I've run through a door. Why am I going? I don't know. Am I going backwards? I don't know where
[10800.52s -> 10806.60s]  to go. What am I? Why are you drooling? I'm not drooling. What do you mean? I'm not drooling?
[10808.54s -> 10811.66s]  Dude, you're really fucking up the flow. I'm sorry. Am I going the right way?
[10812.46s -> 10819.08s]  There it is. I'll make it up for you. I'll make it up for you. I'll make it up.
[10866.39s -> 10902.95s]  Oh, lightning. Mop shit. Yeah. That was an advanced technique. I wouldn't try that if I were you.
[10902.95s -> 10946.38s]  Where do I go? Right? Where do I go from here? Offbeat.
[10967.88s -> 10971.64s]  Okay. Now what? These games have been absolutely wonderful.
[10972.44s -> 10975.90s]  How come? Why do I not find other with these games till last second?
[10977.29s -> 10980.33s]  These have been really wonderful. This has been a wonderful experience.
[10984.98s -> 11007.22s]  Four by four hogwash. Boss time. Well, there's your four by four hogwash. It ain't four by four,
[11007.22s -> 11074.92s]  is it? I don't know who the boss is. Ow. Oh my God. Resurrect. Fuck.
[11103.74s -> 11111.24s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa. That music changed. What? I'm so confused.
[11111.24s -> 11215.59s]  Oh shit. No, don't kill me. There's stuff over here. Whoa, I'm good. No. What happened? I'm so
[11215.59s -> 11221.61s]  confused. I don't know what just happened. Resurrect. Resurrect. It has a lot of stimulation.
[11221.61s -> 11249.45s]  It's a lot of stimulation. It's a ton of stimulation. Damn. That was crazy. That
[11249.45s -> 11267.85s]  was so stimulating. That was very stimulating. Is that the end? There I am. Gas can.
[11272.38s -> 11284.28s]  45,414. Why am I clicking up here like it's a menu? That's not bad. How many people are on earth?
[11292.76s -> 11299.74s]  All right. I give this one a... All right. This is definitely a game that's absolutely... Okay.
[11300.46s -> 11305.32s]  This game is going to be very hard because you know the music is going to change halfway through
[11305.32s -> 11310.92s]  the game here and it's going to be unbelievably difficult to keep tempo and fire and dodge at the
[11310.92s -> 11315.37s]  same time. So I'm going to give this demo. This was Metal Hellsinger.
[11322.95s -> 11337.94s]  A 3.9. I'm going to give this a 3.9 out of 5. For the demo. For the demo. 3.9. It could have been
[11337.94s -> 11343.14s]  like a... It could have been like a 4-6, but I feel like this game is going to be way too hard for me.
[11343.14s -> 11347.30s]  I think this game is going to be very difficult for me. So I'm going to give it... That's not a
[11347.30s -> 11360.06s]  low score. I think that's a pretty good score. You give Agent 64 a 4 out of 5. Oh shit. You're
[11360.06s -> 11374.58s]  right. Okay. Flip them. Agent 64 is a 3... Hold on. Agent 64 3.6. No. 3.4. Hellsinger 3.9. That's
[11374.58s -> 11384.94s]  better. That's better. Okay. Very cool. Let's check. What else can we do? Let's do another one.
[11388.42s -> 11391.78s]  The three or four games we played today have... I mean, I wish I played more, obviously, but the
[11391.78s -> 11396.23s]  stream had to start much later, which I'm glad that we're not having any internet problems.
[11396.23s -> 11405.48s]  So I'm glad that's solved. That's low? No, it's not. A 3.9 is a solid like B, isn't it? Like a
[11405.48s -> 11420.55s]  B+. Okay. We did all these three. Potion permit. Should we give this one a try? Midnight Fight
[11420.55s -> 11429.69s]  Express. Roots of Pacha. Okay. I'm going to be honest. I'm going to scroll. I'm probably going
[11429.69s -> 11437.94s]  to skip things that I don't think I'd be really interested in in the first place. There's Agent
[11437.94s -> 11455.74s]  64. Goodbye World. Escape Academy. This one could be good. Frozen Flame. This could be good too.
[11455.74s -> 11462.34s]  Any on this list that I don't want to skip. I don't know. This looks kind of... This looks
[11462.34s -> 11473.93s]  cute though, doesn't it? How many are there? Hundreds. This game's a visual novel. Is this
[11473.93s -> 11483.61s]  a visual novel game or is this a... Even it is. This is fun. I think I'm more into this one than
[11483.61s -> 11488.52s]  this one just because I like... I don't know. I like kind of jumping around and shooting.
[11488.52s -> 11504.60s]  I'll try Midnight Fight Express. By the way, we're going to do this tomorrow and we're going to...
[11504.60s -> 11509.80s]  This... I wanted just to come back and actually have a stream today, but tomorrow we're going to
[11509.80s -> 11516.42s]  do this all day, so don't worry. We'll try to get to at least a few dozen of these, I think,
[11516.42s -> 11521.35s]  over the course of the day tomorrow. All right. Midnight Fight Express. Is this a beat-em-up game?
[11521.35s -> 11545.29s]  Is it controller? Let's give it a try. Now, you're going to see many F's when I download a game.
[11545.29s -> 11556.84s]  Okay. We've seen a lot of... This game contains bright flashing lights warnings. Loading failed.
[11556.84s -> 11571.27s]  What? Oh. And there it is. And there it goes down to zero. Let's take this down to zero too.
[11573.27s -> 11586.50s]  Thank goodness. These are all cracked out games. They kind of are.
[11587.22s -> 11596.46s]  Blood settings. This is fine. All right. Let's go. That's fine. Don't matter. I think it's good.
[11596.46s -> 11605.91s]  What default is good? Let's just go. We're going to do normal. Let's do it. I don't want my mom
[11605.91s -> 11617.02s]  to see police turn the blood off. This game is made by one guy, by the way. It's a baby face,
[11617.02s -> 11620.79s]  right? I'm going to call you that since our records don't show anything else. Kind of like
[11620.79s -> 11624.71s]  you're a ghost. We don't like ghosts. They have a tendency to cause trouble and disappear. Classic
[11624.71s -> 11629.77s]  ghost. Listen up, you claim innocence. No memory from before the attack began, so you were just
[11629.77s -> 11635.67s]  trying to help. But am I? Do I have any clothes on? But we know that isn't true. You're part of
[11635.67s -> 11640.31s]  this whole thing. The attack on the city, mobilizing the gangs, all of it. What we don't know is why.
[11640.31s -> 11644.47s]  If we figure out the why, we can figure out the how, and then we can stop the how.
[11645.19s -> 11649.48s]  Come on, buddy. Tell us the why. Help us save the city, and maybe you won't get the death penalty,
[11649.48s -> 11654.63s]  maybe. Retrace your steps. Don't hold back or else we certainly won't. Now, what's this about
[11654.63s -> 11686.92s]  a talking drone? Stop the how. Okay. Damn. Okay, cool. A is interact with objects. This chaos
[11686.92s -> 11697.61s]  sit in the city. There's criminals everywhere. Be careful. Take care of yourself. Let me out of
[11697.61s -> 11707.35s]  here. Oh, it's the drone. Okay. Don't think I need to tell you. Beautiful city of tomorrow
[11707.35s -> 11711.35s]  has gone to all sorts of hell. Could really use a little saving. Here's the deal. You're a sleeper
[11711.35s -> 11716.07s]  agent, a brutal mercenary in a trance, waiting for a drone in shining armor like yours truly to wake
[11716.07s -> 11721.45s]  you up from this little dream. I only ask you one itsy bitsy favor in turn. Help me save the city
[11721.45s -> 11727.45s]  and all the good hearted schmucks in it before sun up or the crooks will get full control. Do that.
[11727.45s -> 11735.88s]  You'll get your real life back in the city sees a brighter tomorrow after all. I know I paraphrase
[11735.88s -> 11744.10s]  every thing a dot. Look, I know I'm unbearable. If there's dialogue in a game, you get two options.
[11744.74s -> 11752.18s]  Let's love us. It won't be tomorrow. Okay, or they or a limitation about tomorrow. And I'll tell you
[11752.18s -> 11757.14s]  we need to save this city. Yeah, I either go full on voice acting or I just paraphrase every sentence.
[11757.14s -> 11761.50s]  And I'm sorry. That's just the way it is. I don't I don't like I don't read dialogue.
[11761.50s -> 11767.59s]  Okay, I can't. Who am I fighting? Give us the second option. Fine.
[11769.11s -> 11786.78s]  I mean, it's always just Mr. Satan talking. Yeah. Oh, I almost forgot. Gotta reactivate you.
[11786.78s -> 11790.06s]  Applying a little noise cream should warm up those muscles right up.
[11795.16s -> 11796.36s]  I have this music.
[11808.25s -> 11845.03s]  It's a music game. And I got to do it to the beat. Beat him up. Rip bozo. All right. All right.
[11845.91s -> 11858.57s]  Okay. Do I have I don't have rip bozo on this channel. Block. Oh, it's the Superman game stuff.
[11859.67s -> 11869.59s]  On perfect blocks hit left bumper and then hit left bumper afterwards.
[11870.71s -> 11893.98s]  Left bumper doesn't do anything. Heavy strike. Ah, I see. It has to be a perfect dodge.
[11894.78s -> 11913.22s]  Oh, off the building. Wow. Why can I not get the that's not a perfect dodge. Hold on. Let me try
[11913.22s -> 11936.31s]  to get this down. Swing at me. I'll get it. I can do rip bozo. Holy shit. You can't read.
[11937.27s -> 11968.15s]  I know I'm doing a heavy strike right now. Hey, listen, bozo. It's fun. It's all right. It's fun.
[11977.83s -> 11981.27s]  The rage meter builds up and when you get enraged, you do combat moves.
[11982.63s -> 12003.91s]  I don't hate it. We're getting that idea. I don't hate it. Wait, they think I'm the pizza guy.
[12008.58s -> 12029.19s]  Dude, pizza tonight. Pizza tonight. That's what I'm thinking. Is there like a dodge roll or anything?
[12029.19s -> 12066.71s]  Okay, break their defense. Melee weapons. Yeah, it's just it's Batman. It's Batman. I could say
[12066.71s -> 12069.11s]  you could get really good at this and it really string combos together and stuff.
[12069.75s -> 12078.34s]  There's probably melee weapons. Oh, there is a dodge. Okay, now the game just got way better.
[12090.82s -> 12096.12s]  Oh, I can pick that up. How do I pick it up? I want to pick up the weapon.
[12096.68s -> 12107.32s]  I definitely can pick it up as soon as I can. How do I pick that up?
[12107.88s -> 12110.84s]  Right bumper. Oh, nice. All right. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.
[12112.84s -> 12126.70s]  Give me the bat. Don't come any closer or I'll slit this. You have a wrench in your hand?
[12132.22s -> 12151.21s]  It's dangerous. Jesus. Okay. Focus. You can scan the environment. Interesting. Okay.
[12152.57s -> 12177.91s]  This is fun. Photo mode. I got a good photo. All right. Whatever.
[12186.92s -> 12196.42s]  Really? What happened? What happened? Oh, I. Okay. You have to hold it.
[12203.51s -> 12212.79s]  All right. This. Yeah, this is fun. They should not have let me do this because I'm not going to do
[12212.79s -> 12244.22s]  anything else. Bozo's guns have this guns in the game too. What? Okay. This is this is a three eight.
[12244.86s -> 12259.69s]  No, it's not. This is your hideout. These levels own unique items that you can lock by completing
[12259.69s -> 12265.64s]  challenges. Challenge listed here after the level is unlocked. Learn more about the enemies
[12265.64s -> 12275.42s]  you'll fight. Each level you can earn money, skills and upgrades, appearance, the playground,
[12275.42s -> 12286.44s]  your progression tab. There's a lot here. I'm in trouble. I'm in. I'm going to be in trouble.
[12287.83s -> 12299.27s]  I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. Okay. I want to do throw stuff at people. Grapple enemies,
[12300.36s -> 12306.55s]  follow up chain strikes, parry and count. Oh, parry. This is okay. I thought this was way.
[12307.27s -> 12311.05s]  I'm going to be honest with you. The first five minutes of this game. I was like, yeah, it's a two
[12312.73s -> 12317.32s]  seeing all this. This just bumped up to just bumped up somewhere in the threes.
[12317.88s -> 12339.11s]  Yeah. This was a two when I first started. Let's do grapple. Cool. Yeah. I want it. Okay. Assign it.
[12339.11s -> 12350.63s]  Okay. Cool. The game needs screen shake. There is a screen check option in there. Actually,
[12350.63s -> 12356.89s]  I want to make a point with this. I want to keep, I want you guys to keep tabs, keep track of the
[12356.89s -> 12360.62s]  games we're playing tomorrow. We're going to do the same thing. Keep track of how many games have
[12360.62s -> 12369.58s]  screen shake enabled in the options. This is an experiment. Turn it on. Sure. I'd like to,
[12369.58s -> 12373.02s]  let's see what it's like with screen shake on. I'm sorry. I need to, we need to prove this point.
[12386.42s -> 12402.82s]  Yeah. Like all, all screen shake does is just move the camera in closer and moving around and
[12402.82s -> 12415.74s]  shaking around. How much worse is this game now that every time I swing, I go
[12422.22s -> 12426.94s]  and this one, I will give credit to the dev here. This one's not as egregious as a lot of them really
[12426.94s -> 12436.04s]  are. I understand impact, right? But some of them, there's this lateral shake that some of them do.
[12436.04s -> 12440.90s]  So this one's going like this. So here's your screen, right? Here's your screen. This one's
[12440.90s -> 12453.46s]  going like this, like that. A lot of these fucking stupid ass games go like this. That's the one I'm
[12453.46s -> 12463.50s]  talking about. Not the one that goes like this. The one that goes, oh, I hate that trend so much.
[12463.50s -> 12474.73s]  I quit video games if it stays, but have you noticed you see what's going on here? Take a look.
[12475.29s -> 12495.26s]  Have you puked yet? Don't quit. You're so dramatic. I'm kidding. I'm not going to quit
[12495.26s -> 12499.74s]  video games because some games have a screen shake enabled, but I will complain about it.
[12500.30s -> 12538.94s]  Like a whiny little baby. Gold? Honey grab? What's a grab move? I don't really like the
[12538.94s -> 12552.22s]  impact shake. No, and everyone's putting it in every game. Bulky bozos? What the fuck, dude?
[12552.22s -> 12591.70s]  Batman didn't kill people. Didn't even get to do the tutorial with that guy. Okay. Shit, I keep
[12591.70s -> 12621.30s]  missing it. Hold on. Ready? Swing. Turn the screen shake off. It's making my stomach hurt.
[12621.30s -> 12637.90s]  It's making your stomach hurt. It's fucking with me too. Yeah. Who is responsible for this being
[12637.90s -> 12655.82s]  in every game? All right. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a 3.4. Pretty damn good. Pretty good. It's
[12655.82s -> 12664.86s]  a 3.4. That's a 3.4. Next one. That was Midnight Fight Express, and that was a good one. That was
[12664.86s -> 12671.30s]  a 3.4. Solid. I think that with a little bit more time in it, I'd probably make that score a little
[12671.30s -> 12681.51s]  higher. 3.4 is not a passing grade, is it? What are you talking about? Because it is. How is that
[12681.51s -> 12690.46s]  not a passing grade? That's like a good score. Okay. Anything on this first drop down here that
[12690.46s -> 12698.41s]  I don't want to skip? I'm telling you, potion permit is looking kind of pog to me. I think I
[12698.41s -> 12707.50s]  want to do it. It's looking pretty good to me. One dev project. Okay. A one dev project makes that
[12707.50s -> 12714.49s]  way better. That's actually insane. That's remarkable. That's one person. I'm doing potion
[12714.49s -> 12725.67s]  permit. I'm going for it. That's actually a crowning achievement for one person to do that.
[12725.67s -> 12733.93s]  I just think I need a little bit more time in it. You know what I'm saying? Okay. Let's do it.
[12733.93s -> 12740.09s]  Potion, uh, potion power or whatever the game's called. I don't remember.
[12740.09s -> 12745.40s]  Potion permit. I'm thinking this is going to be a mid- this is going to be a mid-four.
[12745.40s -> 12762.87s]  Get it over with already. What? This looks like a potential mid-4.2 game. Look at how cute this is.
[12762.87s -> 12772.71s]  Hold on. I'm going to turn it up. Guys, not every game has to have people getting punched in the
[12772.71s -> 12777.35s]  face until their brains explode. You can do a potion game, okay? Listen to the music.
[12777.99s -> 12793.58s]  Listen to the music. Attack, inventory, roll. Four buttons. Perfect for me. Resolution, 720p.
[12794.46s -> 12825.16s]  Change that real quick. Let's go. Potion permit. Let's do it. Let's go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, okay.
[12826.54s -> 12841.91s]  Uh, okay. Green. Okay. And okay. And okay. And okay. This game has screen shake? No, it definitely
[12841.91s -> 12870.09s]  doesn't. What a bad- worst fit I've ever seen. It was fine. Ah, excuse me. Logan, it's me, Dr. Nester
[12870.09s -> 12878.60s]  from the Medical Association. Yes. I'm on my way to meet our colleagues on Moonbury Island.
[12879.32s -> 12885.37s]  The Association HQ asked me to say hello to you since we're taking the same train.
[12888.46s -> 12895.77s]  Oh my, I didn't realize you were bringing your dog along. Isn't he adorable? What's his name?
[12901.77s -> 12908.92s]  I don't care. It's a demo. Such an adorable name. Are you going to help out on Logan's important
[12908.92s -> 12920.76s]  assignment? No, zero, zero, zero. We're almost at Moonbury's station. While you're on the island,
[12920.76s -> 12929.78s]  you'll be representing the Medical Association. You have everything in order. This is a valuable
[12929.78s -> 12936.44s]  opportunity for us. We're all counting on you. If you're successful, we may finally be allowed
[12936.44s -> 12944.14s]  to establish a branch on the island. Camera shake. That's- we're in a train. I'm not swinging
[12944.14s -> 12948.94s]  a sword and my whole head is shaking. We're on a train. It makes sense. It's fine when you're on a
[12948.94s -> 12956.17s]  goddamn moving vehicle. Okay, let's go. There's no screen shake. There's no screen- a camera shake
[12956.17s -> 12970.01s]  is- I'm talking about impact screen shake when you swing a weapon or shoot somebody. This is it.
[12970.01s -> 12979.99s]  Logan, Moonbury Island. God, hurry up already. I just want to play the demo. I don't care shit
[12979.99s -> 12996.84s]  about any of these people. Logan, we've been expecting you. Oh yes, allow me to welcome you
[12996.84s -> 13010.66s]  to Moonbury. My name is Meyer. I'm the mayor. This is my wife, Marielle. Didn't I just skip-
[13010.66s -> 13024.34s]  didn't I hold the skip button? It's a two. I'm just- we're missing such important shit here.
[13025.72s -> 13029.16s]  Good evening, everyone. We've come together tonight to welcome a guest.
[13031.26s -> 13040.41s]  Please allow me to introduce Logan. Logan is a chemist sent by the Medical Association.
[13041.69s -> 13048.34s]  As you are all aware, our daughter has been sick for a long time. My wife and I are still trying
[13048.34s -> 13060.65s]  to find a cure for her illness. The people are shaking. Stop it. With that in mind, we have sought
[13060.65s -> 13069.05s]  assistance from the capital. I hope you all give Logan a warm welcome. A chemist, I see. Never
[13069.21s -> 13074.17s]  thought I'd see another chemist in our town. We know you're desperate for a cure, but we-
[13074.89s -> 13080.01s]  you want to watch who you bring in, Meyer. That person's upset. A chemist? Well,
[13080.01s -> 13085.67s]  shiver me timbers. I've crewmates more competent than this novice. How do you know that already?
[13087.67s -> 13091.83s]  Concerned. Nobody from the capital can be trusted. Have you forgotten what they did?
[13092.87s -> 13096.95s]  Concerned. Oh, thinking. Concerned. Sad. Thinking. Reserved.
[13097.51s -> 13105.80s]  Now, now. Won't anyone make a newcomer feel welcome? Please forgive us. Everyone is just a
[13105.80s -> 13115.54s]  little excited. Now, if you'd like to follow me, I'll show you to your lodgings. This game's probably
[13115.54s -> 13122.23s]  like a four. Just wait till we get to the menu. The crafting menu. This old building used to be
[13122.23s -> 13133.43s]  our previous chemist's house. Its former owner moved away a long time ago. Now that it's empty,
[13133.43s -> 13141.82s]  you can take it over. I realize it might seem rather odd to you that not everyone here is
[13141.90s -> 13146.57s]  overjoyed about. Yeah, what's going on with that? We've rather a history of incidents involving the
[13146.57s -> 13154.28s]  medical association. Our relationship has been rather disastrous so far. I imagine they haven't
[13154.28s -> 13160.31s]  told you a single word about all this in the capital. This is cute. I like this. You'll learn
[13160.31s -> 13164.87s]  more about it as you discover the island. Let's come back to all this after you've rested, shall
[13164.87s -> 13172.86s]  we? And please don't forget our request. Our daughter needs your help. I'll see you tomorrow,
[13172.86s -> 13182.36s]  Logan. Good night, sleep well. Dude, what the fuck? Where's the instantaneous dopamine?
[13186.73s -> 13200.98s]  You can move your character around freely while you're running. Your dog will follow you wherever
[13200.98s -> 13206.87s]  you go. Sadly, he's not allowed to come inside the house. Why not interact with obstacles around you?
[13206.87s -> 13219.10s]  You'll see a sign. I got a health bar. Okay, that was a pretty sick Minecraft sounds. Okay,
[13219.82s -> 13237.14s]  you can decorate your room. This game's so cute. It is so cute. Cool. You can acquire more furniture
[13237.14s -> 13251.06s]  by purchasing them from the bulk and bill. The music is really good too. Very good. Try answer.
[13251.94s -> 13269.34s]  Oh my god, this place is, look at this. It's a dodge roll. Huh? Good morning. I trust you slept
[13269.34s -> 13279.27s]  well. Excellent. Allow me to introduce Zhao, my assistant. This is Zhao. Very nice to meet you.
[13281.26s -> 13289.13s]  I work with Mayor Meyer at the town hall. I was hoping the two of you would get along. If there's
[13289.13s -> 13294.55s]  anything you need, Zhao will be able to assist you. As it is your first day, I'd like you to
[13294.55s -> 13299.02s]  get started and know our island. I've asked one of our rangers to meet you near Meadow
[13299.02s -> 13311.29s]  Range and show you the ropes to get there. The music, listen to this. This is wonderful. Okay.
[13316.02s -> 13324.02s]  Okay. Yeah, this is comfy. I like this. This is comfy.
[13325.46s -> 13329.67s]  Highlighted quest. Go to the Meadow Range entrance. Mini map at the top right of the screen
[13329.67s -> 13337.27s]  shows quest objectives as icons. You can apply chapstick liberally to your lips because you need
[13337.27s -> 13352.23s]  it so bad and it's not here. Nevermind. Okay. Go to the Meadow Range entrance. I mean, the art is
[13352.23s -> 13359.83s]  beautiful. Music's really fantastic. Art is beautiful. Looks really nice. It's pretty clean.
[13360.55s -> 13365.11s]  Very readable. All the font. I can see everything. Quest markers help.
[13365.11s -> 13388.46s]  There's a dog. That's a big plus. You're right. I have a phone map too. Oh, okay. Look at this
[13388.46s -> 13411.66s]  little town. Pet the dog. I don't think you can pet the dog. Maybe you can. Wait, this way. I like
[13411.66s -> 13432.90s]  the cape. Uh oh. Hey there. You must be the chemist. My name's Forrest. Mayor Meyer said you'd be coming
[13432.90s -> 13441.90s]  this way. I've got a little something for you. Call it a welcome gift. You might need it because
[13441.90s -> 13447.58s]  I've got an errand for you. Here we go. I want you to gather some herbs. I'm sure you know how,
[13447.58s -> 13458.81s]  right? Probably. An accident in the past killed off many of our native plants. If only people from
[13458.81s -> 13467.85s]  capital worked responsibly, tragedies like that wouldn't happen. That's not good. Oops, me in my
[13467.85s -> 13472.74s]  big mouth. Once you're done, head back to my cottage. I'll see you there. All right. So go get herbs?
[13480.90s -> 13486.38s]  That's all. All right. Good luck. Swing your tools at gathering points to forge resources.
[13486.38s -> 13490.78s]  Gathering points are indicated. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stamina is consumed. You can switch tools.
[13492.60s -> 13500.70s]  Sickle, hammer, and axe. Dodge rolling. Does not consume stamina. Whoa.
[13503.45s -> 13525.56s]  Hell yeah. What did you give it a two? Wrong. Wrong. Oh shit, they're alive.
[13540.92s -> 13547.72s]  There ain't screen shake stuff. There is no screen shake. Stop it.
[13547.72s -> 13570.28s]  Get basil, get daisy. Okay. Sticky gel. How do I feed the dog? Dog interaction.
[13571.70s -> 13584.63s]  Ah, okay. Your dog loves food and loves to be petted. You can do this. All right, that's cute.
[13585.27s -> 13597.02s]  I wanted to... Wait, I wanted to open the dog menu. Apple juice? Why would you... I wouldn't
[13597.02s -> 13614.92s]  feed my dog apple juice. But okay. This is probably going to be one of those really comfy
[13614.92s -> 13624.66s]  star do-like games, isn't it? Just load it up, burn like eight hours in here, just collecting goo.
[13630.42s -> 13633.29s]  Oh shit. I gotta upgrade the tools.
[13635.29s -> 13661.00s]  I can't... I don't think I can turn it off. But it's only... It's only on certain actions though.
[13664.01s -> 13687.13s]  Did I get stumped too? Where are these things I'm supposed to be getting?
[13687.77s -> 13717.54s]  Where's the jasmine and the basil? It says it's supposed to be over here. Enemy? Spores.
[13717.54s -> 13726.31s]  I need basil. All right. I got... I got plenty of rocks. I need basil and jasmine.
[13726.87s -> 13749.22s]  Now. Am I going too far away? Is this... What is this? Jasmine. Yep. Got it.
[13751.62s -> 13771.61s]  I like it. I like it. Now I just need basil. What the fuck is that?
[13773.24s -> 13800.92s]  That's not a cute thing. That's a scary monster. Oh, this one's got moss on it.
[13800.92s -> 13820.39s]  I think it's worth more. It's more valuable. Honey? No, copper nugget. Okay. I need three...
[13820.39s -> 13840.04s]  I'm not... I'm gonna do this task. Here, have some apple juice. All right. I'm ready to give
[13840.04s -> 13853.86s]  my demo assessment. You ready? Demo assessment. Here it is. You ready for this? I think this is
[13853.86s -> 13857.94s]  going to be a game you spend a lot of time in. I feel like it's going to be really fun. I feel
[13857.94s -> 13865.14s]  like it's very engaging. Tons of characters to care about. We got a day-night cycle. It's got a
[13865.14s -> 13874.52s]  dodge roll. There's a lot to do, it looks like. There's a big town. There's a boat, which means
[13874.52s -> 13887.03s]  it's probably another town. I think I'm gonna... I'm gonna be ballsy with this one. I think this
[13887.03s -> 13907.35s]  is gonna be a... I think this is... I'm gonna be ballsy with this thing. 3.6. That's very safe.
[13907.35s -> 13913.24s]  That's not ballsy. That's very safe. I don't know. Okay. It's hard to give an assessment on this
[13913.24s -> 13917.08s]  demo because it's a demo of a game that probably has like a hundred plus hours of content in it.
[13917.88s -> 13931.98s]  I'll tell you, from what's here, I think this is very, very nice. Southeast of the plants.
[13932.71s -> 13938.95s]  What's... Oh, you didn't even see that. I got... I just got like a secret treasure map.
[13947.19s -> 13969.03s]  Southeast, where... A lot of bears. Oh, there it is. Oh, God. You're only rating the demos? Oh,
[13969.03s -> 13976.42s]  that's right. Okay, sorry. All right. The game's probably gonna be really fun, but I think the
[13976.42s -> 13991.94s]  demo is... But how do you make a demo with a game this big? Basil is true north right now. I just
[13991.94s -> 14000.81s]  got one right there. This with the... Okay, let me paint you a picture here. This with a cup of coffee.
[14001.37s -> 14007.27s]  Just shut up. Listen to the music. Imagine you've got in your hand. You're at your computer,
[14007.27s -> 14012.09s]  you're at your desk, you're in your room, whatever. Listen to the music. You got a hot coffee. A coffee
[14012.09s -> 14016.73s]  is right here and it's burning hot. I mean, you're just gonna... You're gonna hold it here and you're
[14016.73s -> 14022.01s]  just gonna smell it. You're not gonna take a sip. Then you're gonna put it down and you're gonna do
[14022.01s -> 14030.54s]  that like five or six more times until you take one sip. That's this kind of game. What's wrong?
[14031.18s -> 14046.86s]  What's wrong with me? Did I not even complete the mission? Am I too tired? Stamina, right? Yeah,
[14046.86s -> 14057.19s]  okay. Can I fail? Yeah, this is a brew a hot cup of coffee and sit here and smell the coffee while
[14057.19s -> 14066.68s]  you play and then take a sip every now and then. Like, I would just sit here and just do that,
[14066.68s -> 14088.20s]  like this, and then cast a fishing line. Lots of fails, lots of triumphs. No, we want to drink
[14088.20s -> 14094.36s]  Mountain Dew. No, drink... Just have like a nice just cup of coffee and I like... Coffee needs to
[14094.36s -> 14109.13s]  be just raw. It's got to be... I just... I like black coffee. I'm getting lost in the woods here.
[14115.21s -> 14122.04s]  You get a nice hot cup of black coffee. Oh my goodness. This game's score went up because I
[14122.04s -> 14132.22s]  thought about doing that without a doubt. This sound and this bridge, I can smell the coffee
[14132.22s -> 14143.74s]  beans and it's gonna make it a 3-5. All right, next. I failed the tutorial mission. Do you remember
[14143.74s -> 14148.78s]  you're the worst reviewer? I can't review this game. I can't even review the demo.
[14150.71s -> 14156.63s]  It's a huge game. It's very cute. The soundtrack is really, really wonderful. I like the art style.
[14156.63s -> 14160.95s]  I think the characters are really interesting. I think the coffee smell is gonna be up there,
[14160.95s -> 14173.37s]  so I'm gonna give it a 3.5. I think the demo is a solid 3.5 out of 5. I think that's good.
[14174.90s -> 14178.90s]  Let's do... You know what? Let's do, what, one or two more? I don't want to go too late. I just
[14178.90s -> 14185.21s]  want to make sure I stream today. It was 3.6? Yeah, that's what it was. 3.7. That's what the
[14185.21s -> 14189.93s]  final score is. No, it's not. 3.6. That's good. Rating demos is like the dumbest thing you could
[14189.93s -> 14202.36s]  possibly do. I can't think of anything stupider than rating a demo. What about this game? What
[14202.36s -> 14215.26s]  about this one? What do you think? Frozen? Escape Academy? Frozen Flame? This one looks okay.
[14217.86s -> 14229.53s]  Terra Invicta? No. No, this looks way too... I don't play games like this. This is like space
[14229.53s -> 14245.05s]  management simulator. Nope. Neaied? This looks kind of cool. Signals. This one apparently is
[14245.05s -> 14258.33s]  violent. Kind of interested. We already saw this one, which was very nice. The Cultivation card
[14258.33s -> 14277.70s]  game? Card game? Card games can be fun. Gloomwood? This is the... Oh, man. All right, we're saving
[14277.70s -> 14283.94s]  this. Are we saving this one for tomorrow? Should I do this right now? Dude, this game's gonna be
[14283.94s -> 14293.16s]  insane. Should we do it right now or save it for tomorrow? I want to anticipate that one for one
[14293.16s -> 14297.72s]  more day. Yeah, we'll do it tomorrow. Oh my god, I'm so glad there's a demo for this game. I was so
[14297.72s -> 14312.44s]  interested. I'm very curious about it. Ripout? Let's try this one. Let's go. Ripout. There's
[14312.44s -> 14332.66s]  20 gigs for the demo? Holy shit. It's a violence game? Save this one for tomorrow? Um, you think
[14332.66s -> 14348.92s]  so? Okay, well let's keep looking. Moonscars? Oh, it's kind of a 2D game. I kind of want to
[14348.92s -> 14360.25s]  try this. Okay, I'm gonna download Moonscars. Domekeeper? Time management? Action roguelike?
[14364.44s -> 14375.13s]  No, no, guys, guys. It's not, it's not, um, it's me downloading the game. No, no, we're good. We're
[14375.13s -> 14381.75s]  good. It's okay. I'm downloading a 20 gig game. That's why it's doing this. We'll be okay. Don't
[14381.75s -> 14400.06s]  worry. It's done in like two seconds. Trapang 2? No, we're good. We're good. Limit the download? No,
[14400.06s -> 14408.31s]  I want it instantly. It's done. Trapang 2? I kind of want to, I want to try Moonscars right now.
[14408.31s -> 14434.15s]  That's what we're doing right now. Let's do it. Oh, I gotta exit this game. Okay. Don't just go
[14434.15s -> 14441.58s]  through the popular ones. Explore the subcategories. I know I will. I will. There's a lot to go through,
[14441.58s -> 14445.10s]  so don't worry. I'm not just gonna burn through this. Just the popular ones. We'll go category
[14445.10s -> 14455.51s]  by category. All right, let's open it up. See how this one is. What the, what the hell did I just
[14455.51s -> 14466.42s]  download? What's the game called? What did I, what did I, what did I just download? Moonscars. Okay,
[14466.42s -> 14482.92s]  yep. Let's do it. Another humble game. I'm imagining this is probably a controller,
[14483.48s -> 14491.00s]  which it seems like it is. All right. Oh, it's 640 by 480. What are you on about here?
[14491.64s -> 14513.08s]  I'm gonna turn it down. Keep it at 480p. That's a weird default. My goodness. Oh, my god.
[14513.96s -> 14522.66s]  99 hertz? That's not accurate. That's, isn't that kind of, that's gonna be weird.
[14526.07s -> 14538.34s]  Just play at 23 hertz? Wait, why, why would you do that? You're out of sync? What? Oh, you gotta
[14538.34s -> 14546.55s]  refresh. You gotta refresh. Sometimes the, with Twitch. Yeah. All right. Well, I'm just gonna,
[14546.55s -> 14562.26s]  I'm not doing 23 hertz. Does that work? You're not in sync? Yeah, you gotta refresh. What just
[14562.26s -> 14576.92s]  happened? What's going on? What happened? Oh, there you go. Let's do it. Things double as you, as you,
[14577.48s -> 14604.84s]  never come to per on my knees these days. This is, I like the painting. The game makes you really
[14604.84s -> 14611.11s]  think about if you want to skip the cutscene. I felt bad halfway through, so I stopped skipping it.
[14611.11s -> 14664.17s]  Oh, it's a cat. I thought there was a person sitting on the bench next to him. Already gets
[14664.17s -> 14673.70s]  a bunch of points. I'll explain. Do you guys remember the game called Out of This World
[14673.70s -> 14678.54s]  for Another World? I'm getting serious Another World vibes, which is a big plus.
[14678.78s -> 14731.53s]  Healing. Icarus is a soul liquid, the very essence of human life. Use it collected to heal your wounds.
[14731.53s -> 14750.95s]  You can't let it go. I can't let it go. I'm telling you, I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy. It's in every
[14750.95s -> 14758.31s]  single game now. I don't, it just is. What resolution is this? What are you talking about?
[14758.31s -> 14781.32s]  Why is it 640x480? Why is it 640x480? I don't think it is. That's bullshit. It was, I don't care.
[14781.32s -> 14800.66s]  It was, I don't care. Ooh, witchery. This game looks unbelievably fun. Hold on. Let me get over
[14800.66s -> 14814.30s]  it. Yeah, it was already was the highest resolution. I think it's just doing that for some reason.
[14814.30s -> 14834.68s]  All right, so I have witchery. God damn it. I'm so mad. So I have witchery now of direct blast
[14834.68s -> 14853.38s]  forward. How do I do? Ooh, that's cool. Can you open the door? This door opens from the other side.
[14854.66s -> 14896.78s]  How do I get up there? Oh, okay. It's major screen shake. How do I open this? Go left? Oh,
[14896.78s -> 14920.15s]  okay. I wasted my stuff. How do I get that back? Witchery spoils ichor. Irma can purge spoiled
[14920.15s -> 14923.35s]  ichor hitting foes with her sword. Spoiled ichor can still be used for healing. Okay.
[14924.31s -> 14944.98s]  I mean, it plays beautifully. It's, I mean, it plays wonderfully. It's smooth. The animations
[14944.98s -> 14955.62s]  are great. The art style, it looks, the art style looks really nice. This is really, it's,
[14955.62s -> 14970.76s]  it's beautiful. I'm very, boss fights in this game, I imagine will be the big selling point.
[14971.32s -> 14996.50s]  Cool. Bone powder. 250 bone powder. Climb the ledge. Oh, I'm in here now. Cool. Kind of like
[14996.50s -> 15016.20s]  Castlevania. Kind of like, kind of like, what's the other game I'm thinking of? Symphony of the Night.
[15016.20s -> 15048.33s]  Yep. That's what I'm thinking of. Nice. It's fun. Am I dead? That's a good one. That's good.
[15048.33s -> 15052.62s]  It's fun. I actually want you to look at this though. This is important before I turn this up.
[15055.29s -> 15065.64s]  There's a lot of moons. There's a lot of moves here. Look at all this. Corpse reassembly. There's
[15065.64s -> 15075.27s]  an entire skill tree. Skill trees are a huge plus. There's a dev in the chat. This game's cool.
[15078.79s -> 15089.27s]  Dev in chat. Rant about the screen shake real quick. No, I can't. I can't do that. I have stage
[15089.27s -> 15116.06s]  fright. Stage fright. I'm like, let me try one more time. That felt amazing. I'm telling you,
[15116.06s -> 15120.12s]  this game is fun. When this comes out, there's going to be people that are playing the hell out
[15120.12s -> 15123.80s]  of this. They're going to think it's like an incredible game. It's going to be really difficult.
[15123.80s -> 15128.04s]  It's going to be hard. The boss is going to be hard. The game is really, really about skill-based
[15128.04s -> 15136.68s]  dodging and stuff. And it plays beautifully. Can you put a thing in where I can take the screen
[15136.68s -> 15140.84s]  shake off the screen, please? Can I? I'm just, I'm asking like, like nicely. I don't want to be
[15140.84s -> 15146.90s]  like a weirdo about this. Guys, if we're going to do this, every dev that, if every dev comes
[15146.90s -> 15155.32s]  into the stream and every game has screen shake, I'm going to look like a real dickhead. These games
[15155.32s -> 15164.78s]  are great. This is, this game is, I'm telling you, this game's fun. And look, I might be the weird
[15164.78s -> 15169.82s]  one. You could probably poll a hundred people, family feud style, and ask them, hey, do you give
[15169.82s -> 15175.50s]  a shit if there's screen shake on every hit? And if 99 of them say, no, I don't care at all.
[15176.46s -> 15196.79s]  And I'm the weird guy that I get it. Shortcut, heal. Oh, that's right. I have to heal. And it,
[15196.79s -> 15205.10s]  oh, that actually, that's a pretty cool mechanic. It uses that. Cool. Shortcut. Ah, all right. Cool.
[15207.53s -> 15210.89s]  Bone, found a grave, bone powder. Imagine that's probably how you level up.
[15211.99s -> 15233.38s]  If you level up, airdrop. Ooh, cool. Spite level achieved. Ooh, wait, there's bone powder.
[15234.02s -> 15241.67s]  I never really thought about it. I know. And the thing is, I, it could have, this could have,
[15241.67s -> 15247.70s]  okay, don't, I'm going to die. What are you doing? I feel like I'm just noticing it way more.
[15251.98s -> 15256.38s]  And I am not speaking out of malice. I'm not speaking out of, oh my God, all these games
[15256.38s -> 15262.22s]  stink. I'm speaking out of my actual physical wellbeing. It makes me actually nauseous.
[15266.82s -> 15270.02s]  I'm not speaking out of malice. I promise you. It just makes me nauseous.
[15270.98s -> 15293.74s]  Constantly shake so you can counteract screen shake. Are you getting nauseous right now?
[15295.42s -> 15303.50s]  I mean, this, this one, I'll tell you, this one is not as bad as some 3D games. It's a lot more
[15303.50s -> 15308.54s]  painful for me to look at. I mean, it's still here and I still, I don't love it. I don't like
[15308.54s -> 15326.34s]  it really at all. But 2D versus a 3D visual with screen shake, it kind of hurts even more. You just
[15326.34s -> 15342.89s]  played a heavy metal rhythm shooter. Yeah, but listen, listen, it's, it, you know what I'm saying?
[15357.83s -> 15373.46s]  R, B, oh, there's actually a parry. Cool. Let me try parry. That was cool. All right. I like that
[15374.10s -> 15380.15s]  spike menu. Let's check it out. Instant heal, build up effect, critical. Oh, critical. Definitely.
[15384.02s -> 15388.46s]  Spell cost. What about instant heal? I feel like that's a good one.
[15389.42s -> 15402.54s]  I, wait, you doing a poll right now for screen shake? How did only 500 people vote in that poll?
[15402.54s -> 15409.98s]  There's 10,000 people here. Oh my God. So many of you do not give a shit about this at all.
[15410.62s -> 15415.74s]  You don't care to even participate in the poll. You just don't even care. That's so funny.
[15417.42s -> 15424.30s]  That's hilarious. A majority of you do not care at all. Have you been rolling your eyes the whole
[15424.30s -> 15441.85s]  time? You just don't care. How many people voted on? How many people said to put it on? Not even
[15441.85s -> 15452.82s]  a, like a 5% voting turnout. Oh my goodness. And somebody actually said, I don't even fucking care.
[15452.82s -> 15460.36s]  Laughing my ass off. Somebody said, I didn't even know there was a poll. You're not even watching my
[15460.36s -> 15473.61s]  stream. You're not even watching the stream. God, I love this. I have so much fun. It's too fun.
[15473.61s -> 15480.30s]  That's too fun to stream. It really is. Boss fight. I'm gonna do wicked messy hair for the
[15480.30s -> 15489.00s]  rest of the day. Okay. This moon forsaken place serves as a shelter to as creatures gray ermine
[15489.00s -> 15505.67s]  meats. Oh, kind of like a hub world. Cool. Zoran, is that you? What happened to me, Zoran? I've been
[15505.67s -> 15510.22s]  on the quest head and eye. Did something happen between us? My guts ache like I've been put in a
[15510.22s -> 15518.62s]  grinder. You're meowing too loudly, kitten. It's not Zoran. It won't respond. Ah, cleft husk has the
[15518.62s -> 15523.98s]  same grim face as Zoran himself. You poor, poor kitten. I'm a cat? It may be still one of us. This
[15523.98s -> 15528.73s]  husk can shape fine clay vessels for you. These strong bodies will help you slip from the clutches
[15528.73s -> 15534.20s]  of pain, yet only for so long. Get a chance to heal your wounds, gray kitten. Just, I'm a cat.
[15534.84s -> 15556.01s]  There you go. What is this? The cat is right. I lost a lot of ichor. I can't fight in full force
[15556.01s -> 15566.36s]  with that gland shattered like that. I need to cast a mold. New poll? No, you didn't participate
[15566.36s -> 15587.08s]  in the first one. Look at how cool that looks. I love the animation. I love the art style.
[15587.88s -> 15608.18s]  Let's do, I'm gonna do hammer. Very cool. How do I put, how do I put the hammer on?
[15610.46s -> 15628.41s]  I think it's already on. We're born orphans. So it doesn't take stamina or anything. Nice.
[15631.80s -> 15634.92s]  10,000 people joined after the poll. I mean that we're, we're, we're very late.
[15652.50s -> 15659.94s]  Screen shake aside, I think this game is actually, the demo is, is very fun. I think the game is,
[15659.94s -> 15664.58s]  okay, I think this is, I think this game is going to be good. I think it's going to be very good.
[15665.46s -> 15691.83s]  Bland 3.7. If I could play without screen shake, it's a four. I genuinely think this game would be
[15691.83s -> 15700.14s]  fun. It is fun. I'm just a fucking baby. I'm not kidding. I genuinely think this is a really,
[15700.14s -> 15705.59s]  really cool game. Genuinely. In fact, I'm going to play it for another few minutes.
[15715.19s -> 15720.54s]  If Morbius gets a re-release, we deserve another poll. I have nothing to do with Morbius.
[15723.53s -> 15732.55s]  Why are you acting like I was on the team of people that made that movie? Nice. That was cool.
[15736.02s -> 15768.46s]  Shit. Ooh, I got a new level up. Ooh, another shortcut.
[15772.18s -> 15783.14s]  Morbius gets another re-release. Just wait till they make Morbius 2 and they lean so heavily
[15783.14s -> 15799.86s]  into all the memes. Look, they're going to recast Jared Leto with Jay Leno and they're going to try
[15799.86s -> 15819.78s]  to make it with makeup so you can't tell the difference. Shit. All right, this game is fun.
[15819.78s -> 15824.10s]  The Mold's grave was lost and time has passed. The moon has grown hungry, toughening the clayborns.
[15824.74s -> 15831.50s]  Putting moon right at a dart is a lot of info. That's a 3.7 and I would, if I could play it
[15831.50s -> 15837.61s]  without screen shake, that's probably a 4.0. That gets the game seems pretty great. I think
[15837.61s -> 15842.57s]  the star of the show. So what do they give the feet game? Because I need to redo that.
[15843.29s -> 15849.40s]  What do they give the feet game? That was a five out of five. Yeah. Okay. Just making sure.
[15850.12s -> 15854.63s]  All right, let's do one more. I don't want to go too late. I just wanted to stream for at least a
[15854.63s -> 15860.28s]  few hours. Let's do one more. I'm going to, this is 3.7 out of five and I think it's going to be
[15860.28s -> 15863.72s]  really fun. I think people are going to really enjoy it. It's definitely a lot of work went into
[15863.72s -> 15869.24s]  it. A lot of amazing artwork. Story seems really cool. That was a pretty cool reveal right there.
[15869.24s -> 15877.11s]  I don't know. We'll find out, but it's, I could see that being very fun. You know what I'm really
[15877.11s -> 15883.02s]  happy about though? There has been no games that I've played so far in this kind of at least a
[15883.02s -> 15890.66s]  featured one. That was like just shitty. These are all been very good. All right. What should
[15890.66s -> 15905.32s]  we do for the last one for the night? Distera survival FPS. There's moon scars. Well, dude,
[15905.32s -> 15916.33s]  we'll do that tomorrow. People have been looking forward to that. Sapiens. It's a God game. All
[15916.33s -> 15926.68s]  right. I want to do this one tomorrow. One military camp strategy, Alaskan truck simulator. Okay.
[15930.07s -> 15938.71s]  Gunner heat PC, SCP secret files. Okay. That would be probably fun. Destroy all humans too.
[15941.78s -> 15957.46s]  Resist the succubus, the end of the female night. Okay. I'm going to go ahead and just scroll over
[15957.46s -> 15972.86s]  that one. Gunsmith simulator. I could have seen the, it says literally in the title. Gunsmith.
[15972.86s -> 15983.13s]  This seems cool. Broken pieces. There's a lot here. There's no light. Whoa. Look at this one.
[15983.13s -> 16003.82s]  Pixel graphics. Bail or jail. Celico. Tyrant's blessing. I'm not gonna, I'm not playing the
[16003.82s -> 16018.50s]  succubus game. Guys. The last worker. I need one more to go out on. Come on. This one looks kind
[16018.50s -> 16029.88s]  of good. Difficult. Souls like action. I can already see the shaking screen in the trailer.
[16031.08s -> 16060.17s]  I might just get an old hype squad free to play nitro kid. Cool. Ooh. Turbo golf racing. All right.
[16060.17s -> 16064.54s]  Come on. Just, I need one. I didn't want to go out on play that one. All right. I'll try it.
[16064.54s -> 16080.89s]  I'll try nine souls. All right. I'm going to try it. I'm going to give it a chance. Let's go play
[16080.89s -> 16087.62s]  the succubus game with only the face cam on. You want me to play a game that you want me to,
[16091.98s -> 16094.70s]  this is something that you're not going to convince me to do. I just want to make sure you're
[16095.18s -> 16106.31s]  aware of that. I'm not going to play the hentai succubus game with the stream on and me sitting
[16106.31s -> 16114.60s]  here just like, guys, I wonder what's on the screen. Why would I ever do that? Trying to get
[16114.60s -> 16130.73s]  me banned. All right. Let's open it. Nine souls demo. Let's give it a try. We'll go out on this
[16130.73s -> 16140.57s]  one. Thanks for sticking around. I know we're late. I'm sorry. We're up so late, but cool. Here we go.
[16140.57s -> 16150.58s]  So you're not going to some of this game may be considered violent or cruel, explicit violence.
[16150.58s -> 16196.09s]  Wait, what? Okay. Okay. Got those. Got that. Whoa, that's not right. What's with this 80?
[16196.09s -> 16216.22s]  Okay. Explain this to me. What's with the 99 Hertz? I don't understand this. I don't see a
[16216.22s -> 16236.30s]  screen shake option, but it's okay. It's kind of loud. We're gonna raid. What's going on, everybody?
[16236.30s -> 16243.72s]  Welcome. Atriach raid. Thanks a lot, Atriach. Welcome. Hope you had a good stream. What was
[16243.72s -> 16248.52s]  Atriach doing? What were you doing? Something interesting, probably. Atriach always doing
[16248.52s -> 16258.76s]  something interesting. I got ex-squeezed. Was it supposed to be dial? Wait, is there audio? Balloons.
[16258.76s -> 16266.87s]  That game is hard as shit. So good luck with that one. Now, welcome, guys. We are doing something.
[16266.87s -> 16277.54s]  We're gonna do this tomorrow, too. We are doing Steam demos. If you go to Steam, you go to the
[16277.54s -> 16282.10s]  store page. There's a shitload of coming-soon games that aren't out yet that have demos,
[16282.10s -> 16286.42s]  and it's a big event, and I'm telling you, it's cool, and you better check it out, because it's
[16286.42s -> 16290.26s]  only gonna be here for like another week or so. So we're doing this tomorrow, too. I'm gonna pick
[16290.26s -> 16296.57s]  random games on this list. We're gonna check them out. Check them out Thursdays. No, thanks. Thanks
[16296.57s -> 16307.67s]  for the raid, seriously. This one's called Nine Souls. There were hints of a tuber in there? Of
[16307.67s -> 16320.23s]  course there was. There always is. What is with the pee your pants stuff? I mean, I did it like an
[16320.23s -> 16326.98s]  hour ago. It's dried since then. I mean, the smell was a little much, but that got used to it over
[16326.98s -> 16348.63s]  a while. Art's really good, and again, all you raiders, we're rating games out of five. The demos,
[16348.63s -> 16354.39s]  we're rating the demos out of five. The art's... Oh, he smokes weed! Oh, this is definitely like a
[16354.39s -> 16361.72s]  five. I'll give it a five right off the bat. Big bro. I smelled barbecue fish all the way back there.
[16361.72s -> 16369.82s]  Oh, that fish does not look good at all. It's like there's nothing on it. I like the sound effect,
[16369.82s -> 16377.26s]  though. Looks like you snagged a good haul of fish today. You're a true hunter. I forget that I'm
[16377.26s -> 16385.14s]  cooking dinner today. You have to leave room for my carefully prepared delicacies. Cook as much as
[16385.14s -> 16389.00s]  you like. I'll eat it all. All right, you've been here for ages. You must finally be getting used
[16389.00s -> 16402.26s]  to the food, huh? Okay, follow me to the secret hideout. Oh, it's so beautiful. It's so pretty.
[16403.62s -> 16410.97s]  Very much appreciate a demo. That just gets right to it, right to the point.
[16411.53s -> 16433.14s]  Go down. Yep. Jump higher. Cool. This game's gorgeous. What's this? Pick up dead man's notes.
[16433.78s -> 16460.34s]  Okay, is there a dash? I am not seeing any of that thing we don't like. We're starting at five.
[16460.34s -> 16478.20s]  It's only downhill from here, though. Okay, go get the crimson. Okay, so get up there and go
[16478.20s -> 16485.69s]  get the... All right, I gotta fight this pig. You guys are embarrassing us in front of new viewers.
[16486.57s -> 16501.32s]  You're not embarrassing me. You're embarrassing yourself. It's Otto.
[16503.21s -> 16524.58s]  That looks like Otto. Okay. All right, I'll bring it back. Cool. Let's move. But yeah,
[16524.58s -> 16531.21s]  the steam demo thing is going on to the 20th, right? So there's still a little bit of time.
[16531.21s -> 16545.02s]  We need to check him out. Do I fight? Sure. I don't want to kill it. Can I just take it?
[16545.02s -> 16562.58s]  I don't want to kill it. I guess I did. Okay, crimson hibiscus. No fall damage. Good.
[16562.58s -> 16582.14s]  And here's a flower. Let's go to the village. What the hell are you guys saying? You're making
[16582.14s -> 16589.93s]  us look crazy. Why are you even writing this? Market is really bustling today. It was obviously
[16589.93s -> 16595.21s]  a good harvest. Everyone's brought their surplus grains to trade before the ceremony starts.
[16596.63s -> 16603.22s]  That's all we do. Yeah, you guys have a tendency to be a little weird. I did just say I pissed my
[16603.22s -> 16607.30s]  pants and it smelled bad. So I'm at fault too, but that's not as weird as pooping your pants.
[16610.57s -> 16616.74s]  Okay, don't I don't just don't let me influence you. Okay.
[16626.89s -> 16630.09s]  We're weird. Yeah, you are kind of weird. Look at what you're writing. Everyone's telling me
[16630.09s -> 16637.43s]  to shit my pants on camera. It's like 60% of the chat. That's a little strange, don't you think?
[16653.13s -> 16681.45s]  Just ban the word poopoo. Okay, cool. What the hell? I knew I heard it. Everything looks so
[16681.45s -> 16686.76s]  pretty. Thanks for your help today. It's an old custom of ours to wear this flower during the
[16686.76s -> 16690.60s]  ceremony. Only the chosen ones get to wear it that day. There are no written rules about it,
[16690.60s -> 16693.40s]  but everyone knows that the bigger the flower, the more glory you receive.
[16694.12s -> 16698.76s]  I knew you cared about me and that you'd help me get the flower. Still today was the last time
[16698.76s -> 16703.96s]  we'll go walking together in the woods. I really can't believe it was me that was chosen. Is it
[16703.96s -> 16707.96s]  because I always try to do good or because my parents put in a good word for me with the gods?
[16708.68s -> 16734.74s]  Only God knows. I'm not fecal funny. It's you guys. That tasted like ass. This has been sitting here
[16734.74s -> 16738.98s]  all day and I just like drank whatever's at the bottom of it. That tasted awful.
[16739.94s -> 16756.04s]  We've got to get to the gameplay. I need to say I got to give you my assessment. Let's
[16756.04s -> 16765.66s]  don't ask him that. Okay, day of the ceremony. Incoming signal. What do you mean signal?
[16767.10s -> 16771.34s]  It's me. Your wounds must have pretty much healed by now. I just want to remind you that
[16771.34s -> 16775.74s]  the time has come. The passageway only opens again in half a year. If you miss it this time,
[16775.74s -> 16780.42s]  you'll be in dire straits. Make a move already. Those animals have kept you long enough.
[16780.98s -> 16795.19s]  Remember, be discreet. Don't let yourself be seen. What were you doing sneaking about just now?
[16795.75s -> 16801.13s]  I was just talking to myself. Save it. I knew there was something fishy about you.
[16801.13s -> 16803.85s]  Don't think you can fool me just because you wear that bamboo hat of yours.
[16804.65s -> 16808.25s]  A paradise in the sky? Gods? I don't know who made up that hogwash, but I know
[16808.25s -> 16812.33s]  it's odd. Laugh all you want. You wait and say I'll prove it to these morons.
[16822.01s -> 16851.05s]  Wow. Firecrackers. Okay. Let me see. That's a bit of a harsh pull. Not going to lie.
[16853.11s -> 16882.28s]  Why? Is it bad? I can't see it. Is it bad? Yikes. So what am I doing here? I probably
[16882.28s -> 16897.11s]  shouldn't have skipped all the dialogue in the room. Okay. I respect the flying throne.
[16897.11s -> 16906.98s]  What's going on here? I'm going to sacrifice this guy, right?
[16910.42s -> 16950.15s]  What the fuck? Wait, what? We're doing... Oh no, that's not good. What the fuck? No.
[16950.71s -> 16956.71s]  The ceremony is sacrifices. All right, this is crazy.
[16963.32s -> 16967.16s]  Big bro, thank you for taking care of me for the past two years. I'm going now.
[16972.31s -> 16982.15s]  Huh? Tatch foo charm.
[16996.47s -> 17005.90s]  Please spare us from your wrath, oh gods. Big bro, what's going on? All right. I'm way more
[17005.90s -> 17010.84s]  interested. I should not have skipped everything. That was my mistake. This just got really, really
[17010.84s -> 17018.02s]  interesting. And I skipped... God damn it. I skipped the movie. I'm not your big bro. What do
[17018.02s -> 17024.52s]  you mean? Who are you if not my big bro? Who exactly are you? I said, what's the dog doing?
[17025.40s -> 17031.18s]  What just happened? Why did you do that? Where are you going? I'm going to put the helmet on?
[17049.22s -> 17063.18s]  Human body treatment field. All right, let's go. Reflect. Nice. Press to attach foo charm on
[17063.18s -> 17079.69s]  enemy. Ooh. Detonate. What? What's wrong with me? Uh-oh. Oh, you fucking smoke weed, kid. Fucking
[17079.69s -> 17100.01s]  heal up. What is this? Rest? So is this like a Dark Souls game? Oh, that hurt. Okay, hold on.
[17101.53s -> 17117.05s]  Nice. 4.7. It went down. All right, there's a dash. 4.8 went up. I didn't think there was a dash. It
[17117.05s -> 17135.61s]  went up. Back to 4.8. What is this? Blood soaked... Oh, this is their bodies. This is their... Oh,
[17135.61s -> 17155.85s]  okay. That's what they... They turned into like this mush. Right, I can run up the wall, right?
[17155.85s -> 17182.73s]  Yep. What is going on here? Oh, to the guy in chat that said I was never going to use charms.
[17185.37s -> 17261.66s]  You just got timed out for two minutes. Get owned. Get owned. Ow. 4.6. 4.5. I got to get...
[17261.66s -> 17264.94s]  Okay, if I get all three of these guys in one charm explosion, it's a 4.6.
[17268.15s -> 17294.18s]  Excuse me? What the hell was that? All right, 4.3. That was... I landed. That wasn't a skill
[17294.18s -> 17301.35s]  issue. I didn't know I didn't need instant kill. This is creepy, though. This is actually really
[17301.35s -> 17320.54s]  weird. How many charms can I use? Do I have a finite amount? This is weird. Origin of ape man?
[17321.34s -> 17345.29s]  All right, I actually want to know. Okay, how do I read it? Warning. Warning.
[17345.29s -> 17358.89s]  Perimeter breach by living organism. Warning. Shut it down. It's all happening. With that
[17358.89s -> 17363.69s]  stunt of yours, it looks like new Pengly will be abuzz with commotion for a while.
[17364.92s -> 17369.00s]  E, why'd you strike that early? It wasn't part of the plan. Was it to save that human child?
[17369.00s -> 17371.80s]  If you always break with protocol, it's going to be really tough to execute our plan.
[17372.60s -> 17377.98s]  One of your business. I know what my duties are. Don't worry. It's just if you had waited a bit
[17377.98s -> 17381.58s]  longer before destroying the machine, I could have covered up the alarm. I hope you'll stick
[17381.58s -> 17403.18s]  to the script more in the future. This music is wild. Am I going to get a boss fight before
[17403.18s -> 17424.18s]  the demo ends? Nice. All right, so you get three heals. I'm getting some kind of currency, too,
[17424.82s -> 17434.30s]  in the top right. Oh, it's a checkpoint. You set up an intrusion alarm. To unlock the gate,
[17434.30s -> 17474.36s]  you have to trick out the guards. Let's do it. That wasn't too bad. Say the line again? What?
[17474.36s -> 17494.60s]  That's good. When does this game come out? Fuck it, that hurt. Quarter two,
[17494.60s -> 17515.99s]  2023. Damn, that's far away. That's far away. That's in a whole year. That's really good.
[17515.99s -> 17537.59s]  It's in good shape for that release. Yeah, I mean, it feels that way. Hell, yeah. Get in the hang of
[17537.59s -> 17571.58s]  it. I thought it went down. I guess not. Shit. He was in the wall. I couldn't see. What do you do
[17571.58s -> 17596.22s]  with the money, though? Chest up there. I want to... It does kind of feel like Sekiro with the parry,
[17596.22s -> 17610.98s]  parry, parry, parry. Ooh, skill tree. Max energy. This one. Chi explosions are from the charms,
[17610.98s -> 17643.90s]  right? I'm very hungry. Oh my god, I haven't eaten all day. I have not eaten a single piece of food.
[17643.90s -> 17650.55s]  Holy shit, that's bad. No, that's not true. I had a little... In between from when this
[17650.55s -> 17659.27s]  tree had turned up, I had a sandwich. Pizza is going to be out of the question now. I don't
[17659.35s -> 17673.77s]  think I can get pizza at midnight. No, I had a sandwich at 6 30 or so, six o'clock when the
[17673.77s -> 17689.38s]  stream went down the first time. No, I forgot that I ate. I'm good. I was right there at the end.
[17689.38s -> 17703.22s]  Shit. All right. Okay. Hold on. All right. Please somebody write this down because I don't
[17703.22s -> 17713.18s]  remember, but I want to remember this game when it comes out a year from now. Yep. All right. All
[17713.18s -> 17721.69s]  right. All right. All right. Wish listed. Yeah, I know, dude, but I have on my wish list.
[17722.33s -> 17728.70s]  Um, cry of fear is still on my wish list. I think I put it on there back in like
[17729.34s -> 17741.13s]  2010. I just don't even look. I literally don't even look at it. All right. I got it. I get it.
[17741.13s -> 17746.57s]  This is a I'm very happy with the games we play today because all of them have been good. They've
[17746.57s -> 17751.51s]  all been actually really good. I've not we've not seen one of the seven or eight games we played.
[17751.51s -> 17759.64s]  None of them have been bad. That's it. You know, that's really encouraging. I talked a lot of shit
[17759.64s -> 17772.26s]  about Diablo immortal earlier. People are still making games, man. They are. It's easy to forget
[17772.26s -> 17785.37s]  sometimes. They're all on the featured list. Are these indie? Yeah. Well, that's what I mean. Like
[17786.49s -> 17792.12s]  every time that I play a AAA game, I always kind of with some exceptions, obviously. Right.
[17793.00s -> 17805.78s]  I come away with it going. Yeah. Yeah. Like whatever. I just don't care. I'm trying to
[17805.78s -> 17808.74s]  think of what was some AAA games that have come out the last year or two that I really actually
[17808.74s -> 17816.34s]  liked. I think Elden Ring is just all right. It's a great out. It's already at the top.
[17819.06s -> 17838.57s]  Oh, you accumulate Chi that way. I get it. Yeah. Elden Ring. But before Elden Ring,
[17838.57s -> 17846.52s]  what else did I like? Resident Evil 8 was all right. Yeah, it was AAA games are super expensive.
[17846.52s -> 17849.56s]  Companies hate to risk with their money. So most of them are just kind of generic.
[17851.96s -> 17861.64s]  I yeah, but but I mean, I'm AAA games 510 plus years ago weren't like that. I don't think that's
[17861.64s -> 17872.07s]  necessarily correct. Don't bad chest me. Don't bad chest me. Don't bad chest me.
[17872.87s -> 17883.59s]  Did I just die? Oh, they were way lower budget before times have changed in the last five to
[17883.59s -> 17897.22s]  10 years. Yeah. I think that we just saw so many just world defining video games back in like the
[17897.22s -> 17907.18s]  mid 2000s. It's easy to forget that there's other games that have come out. 2017 was five years ago.
[17907.18s -> 17925.58s]  Don't even say that that Jesus world. Oh my god, world defining stuff. Compared to movies,
[17925.58s -> 17932.38s]  the money used for video games is lower. Yeah. Just take screen shake out of your game.
[17937.27s -> 17943.78s]  I think that's it. We'll be live tomorrow. I'm going to try to start somewhere like there on
[17943.78s -> 17947.94s]  four o'clock tomorrow. This time actually starting at four and not leaving in an hour because the
[17948.50s -> 17955.40s]  internet is fucked up. You kind of dried up the featured section. Yeah, we'll go category by
[17955.40s -> 17962.81s]  category and just kind of scroll through. I'm not going to play this Succubus game. No.
[17963.37s -> 17968.18s]  But that's it. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a good one. Thanks for watching. Thanks for
[17968.18s -> 17978.34s]  participating in the stream. I have to apologize because if you weren't here earlier, I was having
[17978.34s -> 17987.27s]  twitch server problems again. And it really kind of blew up the whole stream. I kind of
[17988.14s -> 17992.26s]  took a break for two hours and came back. I'm glad it ended up working. I'm glad I actually
[17992.26s -> 17997.74s]  got a server that actually works. So thanks for watching. See you tomorrow. Same time for
[17997.74s -> 18006.70s]  p.m. We're gonna do this again. No game on that feature list was under a 3.5 out of 5.
[18006.70s -> 18016.26s]  They were all solid games, which excites me. All right. Good night, guys. See you later.
[18016.26s -> 18022.01s]  Oh, we got a minute. So we got like two minutes while the credits roll up.
[18022.01s -> 18042.07s]  Happy birthday to please say happy birthday. Hey, star lapel. Happy birthday. What's the worst game
[18042.07s -> 18054.65s]  that you played today? I don't think there is a worst game. Baseball. Yeah, I said it in the
[18054.65s -> 18062.57s]  beginning of the stream, but I'll say it again. Baseball is moving from July 14th to July 20th.
[18062.57s -> 18082.25s]  We had to make a last minute change. The German Baseball Association will be on July 20th. Diablo
[18082.25s -> 18093.48s]  Immortal. I think all of them sat at a base level of good. The best one was definitely the fee game.
[18093.48s -> 18103.38s]  Angry Foot, whatever it was called. Green screen update. We are almost done vetting the actions.
[18103.38s -> 18116.36s]  I will give you a date that I'm going in front of the screen in the next week, I'd say. Yeah,
[18116.36s -> 18124.58s]  that game was unbelievably fun. There was a team name change. Yeah, but that's not why we had to
[18125.46s -> 18132.78s]  push the event by a week. There was some stuff with the venue that we had to we just had to move
[18132.78s -> 18141.30s]  it. We couldn't do it on that date. There was some stuff that we the venue had to change. Your team
[18141.30s -> 18150.54s]  names are the California Clowns versus the Maryland Magicians. That's one I wouldn't miss. July 20th.
[18150.54s -> 18155.06s]  It's gonna be an exhibition game. Probably right in the middle of the season because I feel like
[18155.06s -> 18168.52s]  that's a good place to do it. Where do the names come from? Well, I'll tell you. It's called Random
[18168.52s -> 18175.69s]  Name of State. That's it. Does it roll? What do you mean? What do you mean where to get it from?
[18175.69s -> 18179.93s]  This is a baseball league that's been operating for a long time. What do you mean? Where do the
[18179.93s -> 18188.70s]  names come from? I don't know. I didn't pick the names. Why are you asking me that question? I mean,
[18188.70s -> 18195.77s]  I am, you know, commissioner, owner, and operator of the entire league. But I mean, there's various
[18195.77s -> 18216.02s]  reasons why you'd have certain cities in certain states. July 20th. Don't forget the baseball mogul
[18216.02s -> 18237.99s]  doesn't know his own teams. Yeah, I do apologize again for the I mean, I streamed for like two
[18237.99s -> 18244.46s]  hours earlier and it was just frame drops, steam maintenance. It just didn't go well.
[18245.10s -> 18254.41s]  Let's get back in the saddle tomorrow. Yeah, and Atriarch. Thanks for the raid, Atriarch.
[18254.41s -> 18263.06s]  If some of you Atriarch fans are here. He is a stand up dude. I highly recommend you go follow
[18263.06s -> 18268.54s]  Atriarch if you don't already. I don't know what you're doing with your life. But that needs to be
[18268.54s -> 18281.21s]  corrected immediately. Very, very cool, dude. Yeah, see you tomorrow. Good night, guys.
