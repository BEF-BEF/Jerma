[0.82s -> 8.32s]  Now you listen here, you bumped me, and my car, and my wife, and she's pissed about it, now I gotta call the insurance.
[8.32s -> 10.82s]  Granny wants this car, motherfucker.
[10.82s -> 15.69s]  You see what you did? You see what you did now? Now you're dead.
[15.69s -> 18.75s]  Alright, let's get out of here. Let's get the fuck out of here, quick.
[18.75s -> 22.47s]  No, no, no, why you?
[22.47s -> 24.47s]  Oh no, I've left it on.
[25.47s -> 26.97s]  I'm holding a loan.
[26.97s -> 30.90s]  I'm coming, Elizabeth, I'm coming to join you.
[33.36s -> 57.38s]  This lady is going the wrong way on the off-ramp.
[57.38s -> 64.52s]  This lady is shit-faced.
[66.98s -> 71.26s]  Don't you see the signs, lady?
[71.26s -> 73.26s]  Oh my god.
[73.26s -> 82.35s]  She finally stopped.
[82.35s -> 89.54s]  What? Is she dead?
[89.54s -> 96.68s]  I think this old lady just died behind the wheel. I swear.
[96.68s -> 99.29s]  Is she? Hold on a second.
[99.29s -> 100.29s]  Hold on a second.
[100.29s -> 104.02s]  She's dead.
[104.02s -> 110.16s]  That's bad news. You shouldn't be this happy.
[110.16s -> 113.16s]  I don't think you understand what just happened. That's never been...
[113.16s -> 118.05s]  No.
[133.71s -> 137.34s]  What is with these dying old people?
[137.34s -> 140.41s]  Oh my god.
[140.41s -> 144.63s]  Get in the car.
[144.63s -> 148.63s]  Hold your horses, I got a stubbed toe here. I got like a bad knee.
[148.63s -> 150.63s]  What are you doing?
[150.63s -> 152.87s]  I'm getting in.
[152.87s -> 155.87s]  What are you doing out here at this hour in this fog?
[155.87s -> 159.87s]  It's this bad in London. I don't remember it being this bad here.
[159.87s -> 160.87s]  This is not even London.
[160.87s -> 162.87s]  That's what I'm saying.
[162.87s -> 164.87s]  This is San Francisco, are you fucking stupid?
[164.87s -> 167.87s]  You're stupid. I don't know how to be stupid.
[167.87s -> 170.87s]  Oh no, you just fucking ran over a bunch of people.
[170.87s -> 172.87s]  Oh my god.
[172.87s -> 174.87s]  Hide the bodies.
[174.87s -> 175.87s]  No, you fucking idiot.
[175.87s -> 177.87s]  Hide the bodies.
[177.87s -> 179.87s]  All right, pick them up.
[180.87s -> 182.87s]  You're not supposed to shoot me.
[182.87s -> 184.87s]  Do you like my old woman voice?
[184.87s -> 188.94s]  Yes, which one of them is it? I know. You told me to come look at the house.
[188.94s -> 190.94s]  I don't know which house it is.
[190.94s -> 192.94s]  I see one on the left.
[192.94s -> 195.76s]  Which further down?
[195.76s -> 200.02s]  Oh, okay. Yeah, I see it. I see the house.
[200.02s -> 203.02s]  Now, this is for sale? How much is this house?
[203.02s -> 204.02s]  You're going to show me.
[204.02s -> 221.62s]  Okay. Geez, it's a tough drive to come down.
[221.62s -> 223.62s]  What kind of house is this?
[223.62s -> 229.62s]  Hey, uh, I'm the guy you're meeting.
[229.62s -> 233.62s]  I'm sorry. I don't have legs, so they made me become part of a bike.
[233.62s -> 235.99s]  I am this bike.
[235.99s -> 238.30s]  You got the drugs?
[238.30s -> 241.30s]  I have the drugs. I'm just so excited about these drugs.
[241.30s -> 244.30s]  Oh, yes. I'd love some crack.
[244.30s -> 247.30s]  I'd also love some cocaine.
[247.30s -> 248.30s]  It's not worth it.
[248.30s -> 253.52s]  No, come back. I just need those drugs.
[253.52s -> 262.75s]  This is confusing me so much.
[262.75s -> 266.25s]  This is seriously so confusing.
[266.25s -> 272.73s]  I feel like I'm moving, but I'm not at all.
[272.73s -> 275.27s]  Can I get, like, hit?
[275.27s -> 276.70s]  Hold on.
[276.70s -> 277.70s]  I'm throwing punches.
[277.70s -> 280.70s]  If a car runs into me, will I bump into it?
[280.70s -> 282.88s]  No, I go right through it.
[282.88s -> 286.21s]  I mean, I guess this is a good bike.
[286.21s -> 288.21s]  I'm just going to get off of it, you know?
[288.21s -> 290.21s]  No sense in, like, you know, staying on the bike.
[290.21s -> 304.24s]  What would I want to stay on the bike for, you know what I mean?
[304.24s -> 312.71s]  All right, he looks like the main character from Katamari Damacy.
[312.71s -> 315.71s]  You know, Katamari.
[315.71s -> 317.71s]  He, like, it's too heavy.
[317.71s -> 321.55s]  He's just like, eh.
[321.55s -> 326.76s]  Why's he wearing his nuts?
[326.76s -> 329.76s]  Oh, it's just hard driving his bike like this.
[329.76s -> 332.00s]  Yeah, it's tough, you know.
[332.00s -> 335.75s]  You can't get any sleep on the road for crying out loud.
[335.75s -> 336.75s]  This is so dumb.
[336.75s -> 345.73s]  I'm telling you for the last time, you shouldn't divorce me.
[345.73s -> 346.73s]  You shouldn't do it.
[346.73s -> 352.73s]  I don't want to be married to any man that would grow a mustache just to spite me.
[352.73s -> 353.73s]  Yeah, I did.
[353.73s -> 354.73s]  I did grow it just to spite you.
[354.73s -> 355.73s]  You're right.
[355.73s -> 356.90s]  Because you're old.
[356.90s -> 358.21s]  Well, he looks ugly.
[358.21s -> 359.21s]  You're ugly.
[359.21s -> 360.21s]  Bill, you got to...
[360.21s -> 361.21s]  You're a bitch.
[361.21s -> 362.21s]  I'm supposed to talk to him about this.
[362.21s -> 364.21s]  You need to pipe the fuck down while I...
[364.21s -> 366.21s]  Hey, Bill doesn't need to know.
[366.21s -> 368.21s]  He just needs to sign the papers.
[368.21s -> 369.21s]  We're just here to tell him.
[369.21s -> 370.21s]  We need to sign the papers.
[370.21s -> 371.21s]  Bill, where are the papers?
[371.21s -> 373.21s]  Bill, where are the papers?
[373.21s -> 374.21s]  Just let us know.
[374.21s -> 377.15s]  I don't think I have the papers on me right now.
[377.15s -> 378.15s]  He doesn't have the papers.
[378.15s -> 380.15s]  Look, the papers are in your office.
[380.15s -> 381.15s]  We'll just go over there.
[381.15s -> 382.15s]  You care if we go to your office?
[382.15s -> 384.33s]  I'm not sure you can...
[384.33s -> 385.33s]  We're going to your office.
[385.33s -> 386.33s]  Yes!
[386.33s -> 387.33s]  Hey, guess what?
[387.33s -> 388.33s]  You know why we're going to your office?
[388.33s -> 389.33s]  Fucking kill him.
[389.33s -> 390.63s]  Kill this motherfucker.
[390.63s -> 398.14s]  What the hell?
[398.14s -> 400.22s]  All right.
[400.22s -> 402.42s]  Jerma?
[402.42s -> 404.73s]  Yes.
[404.73s -> 405.73s]  Welcome.
[405.73s -> 408.03s]  I think we finally died.
[408.03s -> 411.78s]  This is the end of the land.
[411.78s -> 413.22s]  Come with me.
[413.22s -> 414.22s]  Come back.
[414.22s -> 415.22s]  Come back.
[415.22s -> 416.22s]  No.
[416.22s -> 417.22s]  It's my turn.
[417.22s -> 422.68s]  You never hold my hand anymore.
[422.68s -> 423.68s]  I'm getting it.
[423.68s -> 424.68s]  I'm getting it.
[424.68s -> 425.68s]  And you're the grandmother.
[425.68s -> 438.86s]  You killed the guy.
[440.17s -> 442.17s]  I don't know how you got in there like that quickly.
[447.65s -> 449.65s]  It's these things on the top that are keeping me in.
[452.65s -> 453.65s]  You're in.
[453.65s -> 454.65s]  You're in.
[458.68s -> 459.68s]  They said it couldn't be done.
[459.68s -> 460.68s]  They said it couldn't be done.
[460.68s -> 462.68s]  Look how many cars are in the ceiling.
[462.68s -> 463.68s]  What did you do?
[463.68s -> 464.68s]  I fucked this whole thing up.
