[1.34s -> 15.29s]  Hold on now, hold on, just a second here. I need to go like this. Okay, so, uh, we are going without
[15.29s -> 21.88s]  notifications tonight, so no, uh, there will be no sub or bit notifications on the screen,
[21.88s -> 32.38s]  because obviously this is, uh, German wrestling. This is Germany in 2018. I'm gonna give it a
[32.38s -> 37.82s]  little bit for people to show up, because I heard that there were some issues with Twitch.
[38.78s -> 43.02s]  I don't know how widespread they are. I don't know how fucked up they are,
[44.14s -> 48.22s]  but, uh, want to make sure that the stream actually goes through to people and,
[49.02s -> 61.06s]  you know, works. So give me just a moment. I know I wanted to start originally like 20
[61.06s -> 67.40s]  or 30 minutes ago, but, uh, we're going to take a little bit of time. I wanted to make
[67.40s -> 72.76s]  sure I was done before 5 Pacific, because that's too long, but it's ready. It's done.
[72.76s -> 78.55s]  It's ready to go. So just give me a moment. We'll talk. Actually, we could bring up a couple
[78.55s -> 82.71s]  things before this starts. Hey, you know, I'm going to milk the absolute hell out of this.
[82.71s -> 87.27s]  You know what I mean? Hold on a second. Let's talk about a few things, because the stream
[87.27s -> 93.83s]  is probably only going to be two or three hours long, because, you know, it is what it
[93.83s -> 132.22s]  is. But, uh, give me one second. I will be right back. Tata for a second. Shouldn't I be a
[132.22s -> 142.94s]  little more excited for this? Oh, the rumble is here. I'm like, okay, guys, let's talk about
[142.94s -> 151.61s]  a few things first of all. Okay. So let's, let's go over just a few stream related things.
[152.25s -> 160.47s]  No, but this is very, very, very important. Next weekend is the green screen movie night.
[160.47s -> 169.42s]  Now, if you have not submitted your, uh, your piece of art, then I advise you to do so before
[169.42s -> 176.10s]  the 29th. If you are curious of the rules, they're all posted in that discord channel.
[176.10s -> 181.70s]  There's a pinned message. Go read on the green screen submission channel. There's a pinned
[181.70s -> 185.38s]  bunch of rules. Read them. You got to have your video on YouTube. It's got to be uploaded
[185.38s -> 189.70s]  to YouTube. No Reddit videos, no discord videos. Got to, it's going to go into a
[189.70s -> 196.38s]  giant YouTube playlist. So please go read those rules. I want to make sure I say that again,
[196.38s -> 201.05s]  cause we're doing that next weekend. If you're like, what the fuck am I supposed to do? Just
[201.05s -> 211.02s]  go take a look. Pin message. All right. So, uh, I was, I was at Starbucks today and man,
[211.02s -> 215.42s]  what, what's the deal with their large? You know what I mean? It's like not even bigger
[215.42s -> 224.28s]  than the medium. It's like two ounces bigger. Are you guys ready? Are you guys ready to do
[224.28s -> 231.32s]  this? The reason why I'm stalling. It's only been four minutes. What? Not even stalling.
[232.12s -> 235.40s]  But here's the reason why. The last couple of times I've done this,
[236.28s -> 240.28s]  a bunch of people have missed the first two matches or so because, oh shit,
[240.28s -> 247.54s]  I got a notification. The stream just started. I spent like 44 hours on this. So like,
[247.54s -> 250.34s]  I'm going to milk it. I'm going to sit here and talk about my Starbucks trip.
[255.48s -> 266.76s]  Ah, play a 10 minute drum roll. Uh, by the way, um, there are, there are 36 characters
[269.38s -> 272.42s]  and I think only two or three of them are returning characters.
[274.68s -> 285.05s]  I went, I went fucking crazy and just made 35, 34 people. So there's a, it's not,
[285.05s -> 290.81s]  let's look at it this way. It's not just like, cause let's say, you know, usually I spend a
[290.81s -> 296.25s]  lot of time on these, but you know, I got the complaints about Falco, about Wolf,
[296.25s -> 303.66s]  about Star Fox. I got the complaints about it. Nobody wants to see seven serpents in a rumble.
[307.90s -> 314.44s]  So, uh, there, there are no clones. Well, actually hold on a minute. That might,
[314.44s -> 323.90s]  that might not be entirely true. And everybody's here except for everyone beside,
[323.90s -> 327.74s]  like from like a year ago. None of them are there from like a year and a half ago.
[327.74s -> 331.10s]  It's all people from the last year. So everyone from this last year is here,
[331.66s -> 338.22s]  except for the, everybody else. There you go. All right. What do you say we get it done?
[339.45s -> 345.80s]  Let's start. Jamania 2018. What told you I was going to look, I told you I was going to get
[345.80s -> 350.52s]  done before December. Everyone was yelling at me. Oh, there's no way he is going to have
[350.52s -> 360.58s]  enough time. Oh yeah. 36 fucking characters. Can you hear it? You can hear it. I don't,
[360.58s -> 363.06s]  I don't want to spoil it. Hopefully this is set up correctly. If not,
[363.06s -> 372.78s]  I'm going to fucking shit my pants. But anyways, welcome everybody to Jamania 2018.
[386.97s -> 390.97s]  Hey, where are we? Where are we? Hey, where do you think we are?
[390.97s -> 395.37s]  Where do you think we are right now? I'll tell you where we are. We're in beautiful
[395.37s -> 401.42s]  Las Vegas, Nevada. Just waiting for it to pop up on the screen to prove that I've been
[401.42s -> 418.28s]  Las Vegas. San Diego. That's not real. There we are, ladies and gentlemen in San Diego.
[419.56s -> 423.56s]  I turned the music off. I don't want this. I'm going to get copyright strike.
[428.30s -> 437.38s]  All right, here we go. It's time for it to begin. First match of the evening coming up
[437.38s -> 445.29s]  right now. It's an extreme rules match. One on one. I fucking hate this music.
[448.34s -> 452.50s]  Don't delete me. How do I like, hold on. I got to like be really, really loud
[453.30s -> 464.06s]  because this is going to mute the VOD. Don't delete this. But anyways guys,
[464.06s -> 467.26s]  welcome to the first match of the evening. This is one that I'm going to put this to
[467.26s -> 472.60s]  rest forever. I cannot wait until this, this argument that I've made for the last
[472.60s -> 478.87s]  almost full fucking year is, is just stupid at this point. And you'll see what I'm talking
[478.87s -> 482.58s]  about. Oh, you didn't do it. You didn't do it. You didn't kill this guy. You didn't
[482.66s -> 490.90s]  beat this guy first try. That's fine. We'll find out tonight what really is going on
[490.90s -> 496.49s]  because we got the first match of the evening out of five total here is
[496.49s -> 504.90s]  Jerva985 in a one on one match. Looking old as shit. Losing his hair.
[504.90s -> 512.47s]  That's what I look like right now. Somebody just went out. Jerva985 is
[513.19s -> 521.86s]  getting a little higher in age, as I just said. 30, 33. I feel 53. And it's funny
[521.86s -> 527.74s]  because every time we do one of these rumbles, I always make me how I currently feel.
[527.74s -> 533.59s]  That's how I feel right now. Like I, the last time I was like fat,
[534.39s -> 539.64s]  you did boo with me and that's fine. You boo me on my own channel. I don't give shit.
[539.64s -> 550.79s]  But who could I be facing to finally put this bullshit to rest forever?
[550.79s -> 556.31s]  Ladies and gentlemen, my opponent for the first match of the evening
[557.11s -> 562.04s]  is one of the easiest bosses in Dark Souls. That's right. We're talking about a person
[562.04s -> 571.83s]  that I absolutely did not lose to. That's Pinwheel! Extreme rules. One on one.
[571.83s -> 584.79s]  Will I beat Pinwheel again without dying? Because that's what I did. Will I do it?
[585.51s -> 593.35s]  And then we can stop this. Whatever happens here on out. If I lose, I'll accept it.
[593.35s -> 596.55s]  If I win, you all gotta stop that shit. This ain't even, this ain't a meme stream,
[596.55s -> 606.71s]  but I'm telling you. We're making the canon tonight. Go get him. Go get him.
[607.35s -> 612.31s]  What is he doing? He's, he's being a, I don't know. He's being a slow Dark Souls boss.
[612.55s -> 618.82s]  An easy boss. But I will absolutely beat within five minutes. Because I'm the one in control,
[620.41s -> 624.25s]  as you'll see very plainly. But I've gotten older. No entrance music. And there's a very
[624.25s -> 629.61s]  good reason for that. Apparently, you can get, you can get in trouble with copyrighted
[629.61s -> 643.30s]  music these days. So I've heard. No entrance music. Really is. Let's go. Hurry up. Get the
[643.30s -> 652.55s]  fuck in there, Pinwheel. He has taken a long time. What? Jerma's outside the ring, getting ready.
[653.51s -> 658.31s]  Starting his new exercise routine. Well, Pinwheel really milks this intro for good measure.
[659.11s -> 665.80s]  What a good way to make sure everybody gets here. And there it's all angry. Oh dear,
[665.80s -> 669.72s]  you suck. You lost to Pinwheel. No, I didn't. And I'm about to prove it right now.
[670.28s -> 676.04s]  Welcome to Germania 2018. Ring the bell. One-on-one extreme rules. Jerma versus Pinwheel.
[677.24s -> 682.68s]  Couple of right-handed punches there to start. Jerma is old, but can still hang with a young
[682.68s -> 688.92s]  kid. Right into the turnbuckle, his face goes. Twice. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.
[688.92s -> 696.92s]  Ten. Eleven. Eleven times. Ooh, Jerma with a little stomp there, but he missed. Got him in
[696.92s -> 700.68s]  a headlock. No, he's gonna go. Ooh, a little elbow to the face. Pinwheel now on the
[700.68s -> 707.00s]  reversal. Into the corner, Jerma goes. Pinwheel. Uh-oh. He's turning him upside down. He's
[707.00s -> 711.32s]  tying him. He's tying Jerma to the turnbuckle and now stepping on his face.
[712.12s -> 717.48s]  That was an interesting tree of woe there by Pinwheel. Is that made out of concrete?
[719.38s -> 724.82s]  That's not gonna win. No, no, no. That's one. There's no way I'm gonna lose that one.
[724.82s -> 728.58s]  I'm not gonna get pinned after getting my hit. Ooh, what a beautiful break dance move
[728.58s -> 734.90s]  into a Jerma Suplex by Jerma. Absolutely fantastic. You can hear the crowd. Half of
[734.90s -> 740.87s]  them really getting behind me. Half of them yelling about how short I am. And another
[740.87s -> 747.24s]  200 people screaming about how I lost. You can really hear. Oh, what a miss by Pinwheel
[747.24s -> 752.18s]  there. Can Jerma capitalize on it? No, he's gonna get. Oh, what a reverse neckbreaker
[752.18s -> 757.32s]  there by Pinwheel on Jerma 985. He dropped the 985 recently in recent years. I'm not
[757.32s -> 763.51s]  sure why that is. Maybe it's because no. Ooh, beautiful reversal. Maybe it's because
[763.51s -> 768.07s]  numbers back in the day of YouTube where everybody had a numbered channel. But you
[768.07s -> 772.01s]  didn't even really. I don't know why. And people had their birthdays. Why would you
[772.01s -> 776.25s]  ever put your birthday online for a bunch of people to see? And now it looks like Jerma
[776.25s -> 780.87s]  is gonna try the same technique on Pinwheel. The crowd didn't really like that, but it
[780.87s -> 786.42s]  wasn't gonna be enough. Let's see. One. No, only one. Only one. Now remember,
[786.42s -> 792.82s]  this is an extreme rules matchup. So that means every... I'm pretty sure.
[793.38s -> 798.46s]  Whoa, what a hurricane run. A springboard. We saw him do these moves in the green screen.
[798.46s -> 802.76s]  Now he's setting up for a special move, I think. Yep, it's called the whoops-a-daisy.
[802.76s -> 808.15s]  That's old Jerma's special technique, the whoops-a-daisy. He grabs you by the wrist
[808.15s -> 813.70s]  and just falls backwards as you lie down on your back, too. Jerma into the corner.
[813.70s -> 819.03s]  Are we gonna see? Uh-oh. Are we gonna see it? Are we gonna see the diaper? No,
[819.03s -> 823.02s]  that wasn't the diaper. I thought it was gonna be the diaper. That was the double
[823.02s -> 828.28s]  fisted. Uh-oh, he's going to the top rope. Got up there real quickly. What are we gonna
[828.36s -> 836.14s]  see from Jerma? Oh, the stomp. The step on your chest. And that's gotta be it.
[836.14s -> 842.30s]  That has to be it. One. Two. Oh, just barely. He didn't make it. Pinwheel just
[842.30s -> 848.01s]  barely got out of that one. I was like, somebody better check his shoes.
[848.57s -> 852.36s]  Somebody check Jerma's shoes. I think there's fucking weights in there.
[853.43s -> 858.22s]  He might be cheating. He doesn't want to be lambasted and accused and made
[858.22s -> 861.42s]  fun of for the rest of his life. People are cheering. Pinwheel now.
[861.42s -> 866.62s]  He's got him in the submission lock. Is Jerma gonna... No! He... Oh, I thought he tapped
[866.62s -> 872.94s]  out for a second. I was about to scream. Oh, out to the outside we go and Jerma's
[872.94s -> 877.90s]  feeling the adrenaline. You can just smell his armpits from here. They smell like
[877.90s -> 882.46s]  Dove Men plus Care and he's going to the top rope. He's pointing down. This is a daredevil
[882.46s -> 889.88s]  move here from Jerma. Will he? What's he gonna do? Holy shit! I don't know what. That
[889.88s -> 893.56s]  was so unnecessary. That hurt Jerma probably more than it hurt Pinwheel.
[894.12s -> 899.77s]  All I did was hurt my legs. Why wouldn't you kick him? Why wouldn't you jump on him?
[899.77s -> 907.30s]  And now a DDT into the concrete and he stepped on his balls too for good measure. Are we
[907.30s -> 912.54s]  going to get a pin on the outside? Where are they taking this? Just two extremely
[912.54s -> 918.62s]  tall... Uh-oh. Pinwheel is going underneath the... And he's got a pull cue. No, he
[918.62s -> 922.78s]  doesn't want it. I don't want that. He didn't. Oh! Big mistake. A capitalization
[922.78s -> 928.18s]  from Jerma. The slap. Is he gonna go into the... No, it's a reversal. Back down. I'm
[928.18s -> 932.26s]  not sure why he picked up that pull cue there. He's not going to use it. I think
[932.26s -> 935.70s]  he... I don't think he wants to cheat. I think he wants to beat Jerma fair and
[935.70s -> 940.50s]  square. I'm like, uh-oh. I think Jerma might be dead. Jerma's face just
[940.50s -> 944.26s]  erupted. The red marker means you're in trouble. Is Jerma going to tap out
[944.26s -> 946.66s]  here? No, no, no, no. He's not going to tap out. He's not going to tap
[946.66s -> 950.52s]  out. Jerma's got more perseverance than this. Good reversal there by Jerma.
[950.52s -> 954.49s]  As the referee is standing there awkwardly just trying to figure out
[955.29s -> 958.65s]  what to do about this whole thing. And they're going up the alley. He
[959.05s -> 963.61s]  Jerma gets thrown into the entrance way. I think he might have a headache
[963.61s -> 966.89s]  trying to get back in. Both going at the same time. The pull cue is still on
[966.89s -> 972.55s]  the ground. Nice DDT. Perfectly executed. And Jerma is bleeding from the
[972.55s -> 977.61s]  head. Did Jerma get... He didn't... What happened? Oh, right into the
[977.61s -> 982.60s]  concrete. That's right. Oh! Two closed lines. Three closed lines. Will
[982.60s -> 984.68s]  it be enough? Is he going to go for a pin potentially here? Now he's
[984.68s -> 990.02s]  going to pick him up and punch him in the face. Does Jerma know any
[990.02s -> 996.20s]  other moves? A reverse su... Oh, that was a reverse suplex. Could that
[996.20s -> 1003.14s]  be it? Is that going to be it? I think. One, two, three. That's it.
[1003.14s -> 1008.31s]  Jerma beats Pinwheel first try. He got him with the reverse suplex.
[1008.31s -> 1016.20s]  And everybody's booing and they can boo all they want. It's proven.
[1016.20s -> 1019.96s]  That's it. No more of this bullshit. I beat Pinwheel on stream first
[1019.96s -> 1027.78s]  try. Look at all these awesome moves that I did. I was surprised
[1027.78s -> 1032.58s]  that the double stump diaper trash did not seal the deal there for.
[1032.58s -> 1039.67s]  We did have a nice move by Pinwheel here. It was a DDT. People in the
[1039.67s -> 1042.47s]  audience right now, in the arena, are screaming right now.
[1042.47s -> 1047.43s]  Oh, hold on. Jerma's got something to say. Yeah, see? First try. He's
[1047.43s -> 1056.06s]  holding up the one finger. First try. I'm as angry as he is. He's
[1056.06s -> 1059.58s]  taunting Twitch chat right now, saying, yeah, like, look what I did.
[1059.58s -> 1067.98s]  By the way, that's an actual picture of my face, just in case
[1067.98s -> 1074.74s]  anyone was wondering. Moving on to the next match.
[1074.74s -> 1077.86s]  We've got... This is going to be a fan favorite one here.
[1077.86s -> 1088.60s]  After Jerma very, very clearly beats Pinwheel first try.
[1088.60s -> 1094.17s]  Pre-recorded and rigged. No, we're watching it live.
[1094.17s -> 1097.53s]  Hey, scream over the... Hold on. There we go. I can just do that.
[1097.53s -> 1101.45s]  I wouldn't have to worry about the VOD getting deleted. But the next one
[1101.45s -> 1105.46s]  coming up is going to be quite an interesting match.
[1105.46s -> 1112.30s]  It is a six-man ladder match. Six people in the ring
[1112.30s -> 1116.14s]  have to climb up to the top and grab the briefcase. Six people.
[1116.14s -> 1129.80s]  I wonder who's going to win this one. Oh, it's still loading. This has got
[1129.88s -> 1141.91s]  a lot of people are in this one. Well, might as well bring it up here.
[1141.91s -> 1145.43s]  We've had a short little intermission. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
[1145.43s -> 1153.53s]  six-man, six-man ladder match. The six participants
[1153.53s -> 1157.21s]  are a lot of people that you guys know.
[1157.21s -> 1160.97s]  There's the money in the bank. It's two twenty dollar bills.
[1160.97s -> 1163.37s]  I said there's like a hundred grand in there, but I lied. And there's
[1163.37s -> 1169.43s]  Chuck Schnauzwell. Contestant number one in the
[1169.51s -> 1178.66s]  money in the bank six-man. Grab the briefcase challenge.
[1178.66s -> 1183.54s]  Chuck Schnauzwell, one of the murderers of the Sims murder house.
[1183.54s -> 1187.99s]  And you probably could guess who the other five contestants are.
[1187.99s -> 1195.35s]  Maybe you can't. Everybody loves Chuck. The Schnauz,
[1195.35s -> 1201.14s]  as they call him in the locker room, because he's got really great teeth.
[1201.14s -> 1211.45s]  That's what they say. Oh, Twitch chat really seems to like that.
[1211.45s -> 1214.97s]  I wonder... Oh, hold on a minute. Who's the next contestant in the six-man
[1214.97s -> 1220.30s]  ladder match? Six-man? Why don't you add six-woman?
[1220.30s -> 1228.70s]  That's D56TFO98, one of the other members of the Sims murder house.
[1228.70s -> 1238.60s]  D56, very adamant on coming in here and winning.
[1238.60s -> 1244.52s]  Landed on this planet ten years ago. Nice slide.
[1244.52s -> 1248.60s]  You can't practice that five times. D56 trying to show off to the crowd,
[1248.60s -> 1257.78s]  get some people to back her endeavor here.
[1257.78s -> 1261.51s]  You gotta let them have at least a few minutes in the ring, you know what I mean?
[1261.51s -> 1267.35s]  You can't skip their beloved entrance. Contestant number three
[1267.35s -> 1272.58s]  coming in here. No, no, she's got more to say. No,
[1272.58s -> 1276.10s]  I can't really hear what she's saying, because she's not mic'd up.
[1276.10s -> 1279.06s]  But anyways, here comes the third contestant in the...
[1279.06s -> 1288.62s]  and getting booed here. There are loud boos coming in for Frufru.
[1288.62s -> 1294.09s]  If you could... If you could guess...
[1294.09s -> 1298.74s]  Yeah, this is... This is... They're all here.
[1298.74s -> 1303.69s]  Frufru, one of the worst people in the whole house.
[1303.69s -> 1309.74s]  Nobody liked him. I don't like him. And people ironically like him, but he sucks.
[1309.74s -> 1317.78s]  I hope he doesn't win. I'm glad he's getting booed.
[1317.78s -> 1320.90s]  Nice anime stance. He's a big fan of anime. That's what he says, but that's
[1320.90s -> 1331.50s]  what they say in the locker room. You know, because of his hat.
[1331.50s -> 1335.30s]  I like him. I like him. Well, that's fine.
[1335.30s -> 1342.84s]  He's ready. Contestant number four. Let's see who it is.
[1342.84s -> 1351.38s]  That's Gavrett. Gavrett from the murder house.
[1351.38s -> 1354.73s]  Just kind of a regular guy with a weirdly shaped head.
[1354.73s -> 1362.20s]  There wasn't really anything crazy about him. He's practicing his
[1362.20s -> 1365.98s]  Sims dance, because they are Sims, right? That is very
[1365.98s -> 1370.62s]  important for you to realize. They've been computer-generated scanned
[1370.62s -> 1377.27s]  into the into the German wrestling universe.
[1377.27s -> 1380.07s]  You think you'd have any other moves besides put your fists out back and
[1380.07s -> 1386.47s]  forth. Get him the fuck out of here.
[1386.47s -> 1391.48s]  Okay. Oh, by the way, that t-shirt took like
[1391.48s -> 1395.56s]  an hour and 40 minutes to make. So let's just be real about that.
[1395.56s -> 1405.08s]  That's not in the game. Coming up next, number five.
[1405.08s -> 1411.38s]  After Gavrett. I really hope that people are prepared for this one.
[1411.38s -> 1417.24s]  That's Adam Sandler. He's coming out doing his patented
[1418.24s -> 1421.61s]  comedy.
[1424.82s -> 1429.11s]  He's known for that. One of the most talented comedians of our
[1429.11s -> 1436.76s]  of our generation. Probably 10 generations.
[1436.76s -> 1446.22s]  Such comedic routines as Baby Noise does the same weird voice
[1446.22s -> 1451.19s]  and thinks they're way funnier than they are.
[1451.19s -> 1455.32s]  And no, I'm not describing me. I mean, I am. But
[1455.32s -> 1460.47s]  I mean, look, he's a fucking funny guy, okay?
[1460.55s -> 1467.19s]  He's really talented. He's really funny. And this commentator's coming to a very
[1467.19s -> 1470.07s]  strong realization in the right in the middle of it.
[1470.07s -> 1472.95s]  Don't matter. Somebody said that before, didn't they? It doesn't matter. Here
[1472.95s -> 1475.83s]  comes Wally Wheat. Wally Wheat's the real contestant and he's gonna wipe
[1475.83s -> 1481.42s]  the floor with all these motherfuckers in the ring.
[1481.42s -> 1490.50s]  Here are your six. The Sims Rumble. The Sims Murderhouse ladder match.
[1490.50s -> 1493.78s]  These people in this ring right now, all of them
[1493.78s -> 1498.36s]  are insane. They will kill. They will kill.
[1498.36s -> 1503.93s]  They have no problem with it. Half of them are not even from this planet.
[1503.93s -> 1512.55s]  Dangerous people. Incredibly dangerous people. What do you say you ring that
[1512.55s -> 1514.95s]  bell? Six man ladder match, ladies and
[1514.95s -> 1519.27s]  gentlemen. The Sims Murderhouse. Chuck wasting no time. He's going outside to
[1519.27s -> 1521.83s]  go to the ladder. Adam Sandler now with a reversal on
[1521.83s -> 1525.99s]  D56. Chuck does not want this to last long.
[1525.99s -> 1529.03s]  He's got the ladder all ready. It hadn't even been 10 seconds. While
[1529.03s -> 1531.83s]  Frufru is gonna see if he can make that
[1531.83s -> 1536.06s]  a different story. We'll head to the apron outside the ring for Chuck.
[1536.06s -> 1539.50s]  Adam Sandler now with the offensive. There are no teams here. Keep that in
[1539.50s -> 1543.24s]  mind. Nobody is on any team. Whoever gets to
[1543.24s -> 1548.12s]  the top of that ladder first wins. Now Adam Sandler doing his
[1548.12s -> 1552.20s]  patented funny noise. Let me see if I can top him. Let me
[1552.20s -> 1555.24s]  see if I can top him. Hey it's me. It's me. It's me. It's me.
[1555.24s -> 1563.48s]  We're not so different, you and I, Adam.
[1563.56s -> 1569.72s]  Adam Sandler goes over the top ropes and now they're outside. While D56
[1569.72s -> 1576.04s]  is got Adam Sandler smashing his head into
[1576.04s -> 1580.52s]  the steps. Well Garrett. What's something we didn't know about
[1580.52s -> 1584.12s]  Garrett? He seems to be a pretty talented submission artist.
[1584.12s -> 1588.36s]  While Frufru is on the outside trying to get his composure.
[1588.36s -> 1592.31s]  No one has touched the ladder or anything else for that matter.
[1592.31s -> 1595.11s]  Well speaking of the devil here, Wally Wheat's got the ladder
[1595.11s -> 1598.47s]  going over to Garrett. No, Garrett's gonna rip it out of his hands.
[1598.47s -> 1601.19s]  No, I don't know what the deal is with that. Why do they put it down? You have
[1601.19s -> 1605.99s]  a weapon. You're a bloodthirsty murderer. Use it.
[1605.99s -> 1613.19s]  What a wonderful bulldog by DF 5694. Whatever your name is.
[1613.19s -> 1615.51s]  You're not supposed to be able to understand it. It's not even English.
[1615.51s -> 1619.82s]  It's like a weird alien. It's a weird alien dialect. Garrett
[1619.82s -> 1626.52s]  with oh what a reversal by D56 and a scoop slam coming up. No,
[1626.52s -> 1633.40s]  is D56 gonna dump him over the rails? No. She holds back. She does hold back.
[1633.40s -> 1637.88s]  As Wally Wheat now in the corner. Chuck Schnoswell. It seems that they've all
[1637.88s -> 1643.53s]  been training vigorously. Oh what a pose by Frufru.
[1643.53s -> 1646.49s]  That's the, you gotta, you have to get him out of the ring. You know what I'm
[1646.49s -> 1648.81s]  saying? There's six people. No one's ever
[1648.81s -> 1651.05s]  gonna climb to the top of this thing. You gotta throw above the top.
[1651.05s -> 1654.95s]  You gotta go get a weapon. Go grab like a grenade or something.
[1656.04s -> 1661.18s]  As now we've got three in the ring. This could end very quickly. Garrett thought
[1661.18s -> 1662.86s]  about it for a second. Now I'm gonna get the ladder.
[1662.86s -> 1666.98s]  Garrett's got the ladder. No. I don't want that. I think I'd rather
[1666.98s -> 1669.70s]  pick this guy up like a backpack. Oh it was, that's the backpack.
[1669.70s -> 1674.31s]  That's Garrett's special move. I can't believe we just saw that. That's the
[1674.31s -> 1677.11s]  backpack. Adam Sandlin now coming in with a
[1677.11s -> 1681.22s]  couple of punches. What a reversal by Garrett.
[1681.22s -> 1685.61s]  Garrett is on fire here. If I'm gonna make a bet here I'm gonna say
[1685.61s -> 1688.65s]  Garrett's gonna be the one to take the money in that briefcase and win the
[1688.65s -> 1693.08s]  murder house brawl as we're gonna call it. What a
[1693.08s -> 1696.20s]  fireman's carry knee smash to the spinal column. That's the name of her move.
[1696.20s -> 1701.13s]  That's her special move. That's her special move. As D56 is
[1701.13s -> 1706.46s]  gonna grab. No and finally we get to see the ladder used.
[1706.46s -> 1710.86s]  D56 is going pretty much all in on Adam Sandlin.
[1710.86s -> 1714.38s]  Oh it gets taken and nobody's really trying to do anything with the
[1714.38s -> 1718.86s]  ladder besides small pushes to somebody's face. We
[1718.86s -> 1724.28s]  could see blood here. D56 now trying to work that bad
[1724.32s -> 1729.18s]  knee on Chuck Schnoswell. Because his nose is so large other
[1729.18s -> 1733.14s]  parts of his body are weaker. He's got bad knees, bad
[1733.14s -> 1735.93s]  elbows, but he could have real strong fucking nose.
[1735.93s -> 1740.66s]  Garrett now has got the ladder. It didn't even phase her at first.
[1740.66s -> 1744.38s]  That was a little odd. Dropping the ladder again. Garrett's
[1744.38s -> 1746.82s]  going for Chuck Schnoswell into the corner.
[1746.82s -> 1750.18s]  He's facing the ground. Oh what an elbow to stop that. No another
[1750.18s -> 1755.10s]  reversal. They all trained in the same dojo by the way.
[1755.10s -> 1759.19s]  For what I'm being told on my desk here. When they first got there.
[1759.83s -> 1764.06s]  She throws it over the top ropes. Essentially handing it
[1764.06s -> 1767.74s]  to somebody on the outside. Adam Sandler contemplating his next movie script.
[1767.74s -> 1770.54s]  Will it involve a giant pac-man? I'm not sure but it's going to involve a
[1770.54s -> 1773.34s]  broken neck. Nice reverse back neck breaker by
[1773.34s -> 1777.30s]  Adam Sandlin. And a Russian leg sweep here too.
[1777.30s -> 1781.48s]  We've got a problem here though. Chuck Schnoswell on the top with
[1781.48s -> 1785.90s]  D56. It's going to be a superplex. Off the top turnbuckle.
[1785.90s -> 1796.62s]  Oh that's a broken alien spine. She is out. She's out cold. Maybe not.
[1797.96s -> 1800.60s]  But what I was gonna say is they'd all trained in the same dojo from what I
[1800.60s -> 1805.14s]  what I got on my paper here. And weirdly enough they were thrown out
[1805.14s -> 1808.74s]  of every dojo besides they ended up going to some back alley dojo.
[1808.74s -> 1813.26s]  They're not even that's not even uh sanctioned it's not even uh you know
[1813.26s -> 1817.59s]  it's not there's no it's not like unionized there's no
[1817.59s -> 1819.99s]  it's it's just like it was an alleyway that they were allowed in because
[1819.99s -> 1824.07s]  they kept bringing uh glass tubes they're bringing knives into the
[1824.07s -> 1826.15s]  other dojos to try to fight each other and they were just like throwing
[1826.15s -> 1830.82s]  the fuck out. People were saying you can't bring those in here.
[1830.82s -> 1839.75s]  So they ended up getting trained by an unnamed uh sensei and uh they're the
[1839.75s -> 1844.57s]  sensei question mark and I'm not it's it's it's it's actually the word
[1844.57s -> 1847.24s]  question space mark. That's the person's name.
[1847.24s -> 1851.10s]  So and wait Garrett's going up there just barely. Everyone just kind of
[1851.10s -> 1853.58s]  stopped doing something for a minute here. No no no no no. Garrett's gonna
[1853.58s -> 1856.71s]  get that. Is he gonna get that money? Did
[1856.71s -> 1862.73s]  Garrett just sneakily no he stopped it. Garrett almost just sneakily got
[1862.73s -> 1869.16s]  up there and picked up that entire that was insane.
[1869.16s -> 1872.12s]  I can't believe they just almost let that happen and now Chuck has got the
[1872.12s -> 1876.06s]  ladder. We are seeing fatigue settle in right
[1876.06s -> 1882.01s]  now as Chuck is going to try to get the
[1882.01s -> 1886.09s]  ring cleared. There goes D56. Chuck Schnoswell
[1886.09s -> 1890.30s]  is going up there. Will it be enough? Molly Wheat is
[1890.30s -> 1894.46s]  out cold. Chuck Schnoswell's got the briefcase. Is he gonna
[1894.46s -> 1897.91s]  oh they're gonna help they're gonna work together. Oh just hit Adam Sandler
[1897.91s -> 1901.72s]  in the face. I can't believe they actually work
[1901.72s -> 1906.02s]  together. Oh not for long not anymore.
[1906.02s -> 1912.26s]  Oh and the alliances stop right there. Molly Wheat is getting
[1912.26s -> 1916.52s]  killed by the ladder. Garrett now is gonna make another attempt here.
[1916.52s -> 1920.02s]  Is he gonna be able to get up there? This could be it.
[1920.02s -> 1924.26s]  Garrett's gonna chase what a punch to Adam Sandler's face.
[1924.26s -> 1927.54s]  Come on D56 you gotta get up there. Garrett's gonna get it.
[1927.54s -> 1934.46s]  Garrett's gonna get it. No is this gonna be it?
[1934.46s -> 1937.90s]  Garrett is on the edge. They're both on the edge. Garrett just fell off.
[1937.98s -> 1945.59s]  Molly Wheat now can D56 can she make the attempt? Uh oh he
[1945.59s -> 1959.59s]  no she why did she step down? Why did she step down off the ladder?
[1959.59s -> 1966.81s]  Anyway oh and now we've got a forward object in the middle of the ring here.
[1966.81s -> 1972.65s]  Frufru is now going absolute ham on the back of D56 with that big piece
[1972.65s -> 1975.69s]  of steel. Adam Sandler just keeps finding his way outside
[1975.69s -> 1982.30s]  and getting hurt outside. Oh what a clobber into the forehead
[1982.30s -> 1987.29s]  that at least 30 pounds of steel not even gonna set it up he's just
[1987.29s -> 1992.17s]  doing no it's gonna get reversed again. Reversed again doesn't want the
[1992.17s -> 1994.90s]  ladder does want the ladder who knows what the fuck they're
[1994.90s -> 1999.93s]  doing. Just a little tap to make sure that
[1999.93s -> 2016.18s]  she wouldn't get it again. Oh what the fuck was that?
[2016.18s -> 2021.06s]  Molly Wheat now sees an opportunity after Frufru just broke.
[2021.06s -> 2024.82s]  Garrett's back with his knees. Is this ever gonna end?
[2024.82s -> 2028.42s]  Is there ever gonna be an opportunity for one of these psychos to put this
[2028.42s -> 2031.86s]  shit up and go grab that money? Adam Sandler now in the ring for the
[2031.86s -> 2038.09s]  first time in probably five minutes. Nice snap neck breaker there setting
[2038.09s -> 2041.13s]  him up for it. Look at the exhaustion everybody's so
[2041.13s -> 2043.21s]  tired I don't think no one's gonna be able to climb to the top of
[2043.21s -> 2048.49s]  this thing. Garrett's been really consistently the only one that's
[2048.49s -> 2057.14s]  carried and he currently still has the ladder.
[2057.14s -> 2069.62s]  Adam Sandler's got Chuck Schnosswell. What a Chuck's play.
[2069.62s -> 2073.14s]  He tried to do it again he tried to do it to something else.
[2073.14s -> 2077.56s]  He tried to do two in a row but he couldn't get it he missed with the
[2077.56s -> 2080.28s]  other one. That's Garrett now these two have done
[2080.28s -> 2086.12s]  this over and over and over again back and forth trading the ladder.
[2086.12s -> 2092.52s]  What a somersault heel kick by Garrett.
[2092.52s -> 2096.52s]  Garrett now what a leg drop there the ladder is finally set up and Garrett
[2096.52s -> 2098.76s]  has a beautiful sneaky opportunity. You're
[2098.76s -> 2101.40s]  gonna get the briefcase he's got two of his hands on it.
[2101.40s -> 2105.16s]  Can he unclip it? I think he might be able to get it. D56 now
[2105.16s -> 2109.48s]  is barely no barely just stopping it. Is D56 gonna be taking a capital
[2109.48s -> 2114.98s]  decision here? This is it. This is gonna be it.
[2114.98s -> 2120.74s]  D56 has almost got it. Frufru it sees an opportunity to push it over.
[2120.74s -> 2130.46s]  No and she's still holding on. That's gotta be it. That's gotta be it.
[2130.46s -> 2135.82s]  That's it. Frufru just has to climb up and grab it. He is completely
[2135.82s -> 2139.74s]  he's got a free no traffic he's no lane.
[2139.74s -> 2142.86s]  Uh-oh Chuck is seeing they're both seeing it now.
[2142.86s -> 2145.74s]  But was it too late they were too busy fighting each other. What is Wally
[2145.74s -> 2150.44s]  Wheat doing? Why would you do that? Why would you just what? She can't push it.
[2150.44s -> 2158.14s]  No he wins. She couldn't push it. She didn't she ran out of strength.
[2158.14s -> 2163.34s]  Frufru is your winner of the sims murder house
[2163.34s -> 2174.18s]  ladder match. The fucking worst character just won.
[2174.18s -> 2180.02s]  Why would she click that of all the things?
[2180.02s -> 2183.38s]  That guys don't worry this this thing fucking snakes in there. He's
[2183.38s -> 2185.46s]  gonna open that and his life is gonna end.
[2185.46s -> 2192.04s]  So don't worry. Wally fucked it up. No I just
[2192.04s -> 2197.69s]  ran out of gas. D56 got up trying to push the ladder over and just
[2197.69s -> 2211.10s]  didn't have enough strength. The Sandler chokeslam.
[2211.10s -> 2219.45s]  Oh that's fucking great. Can I edit people's chances to win a match?
[2219.45s -> 2223.88s]  I think I can but I know I don't they gotta earn it man.
[2223.88s -> 2228.86s]  I don't give I don't hand anybody victories here. You you gotta earn it.
[2228.86s -> 2232.38s]  I'm not gonna predetermine who wins. It's uh that whoever wins
[2232.38s -> 2239.53s]  they get in there and they fucking fight. If you thought okay if you guys
[2239.53s -> 2242.81s]  thought I could rig these matches why the fuck would I have this guy
[2242.81s -> 2251.78s]  win? Why the fuck would I do that? Hey I got an idea. Let me have like
[2251.78s -> 2257.29s]  the shittiest character win. We got a table match coming up here.
[2257.29s -> 2263.46s]  This is a 2v2 table match.
[2263.46s -> 2269.46s]  Tag match. Oh whoops I forgot I have to mute the audio.
[2269.46s -> 2279.90s]  Sorry about that. We are going back to a different era here
[2279.90s -> 2284.63s]  on the channel. By era I mean different
[2284.71s -> 2301.34s]  console generation. Different console generation than you're used to.
[2301.34s -> 2307.11s]  Oh fuck I asked back there. Yeah because some could say that we are
[2307.11s -> 2312.34s]  going back a few generations. Some could say.
[2312.34s -> 2323.22s]  Let's go and get it started. 2v2 table match.
[2323.22s -> 2330.30s]  Let's see who it is. Hailing all the way from Monster Rancher.
[2330.30s -> 2333.50s]  That's right ladies and gentlemen that's Beanbag Sonic.
[2333.50s -> 2337.69s]  Are we gonna get to see it? Are we gonna get to see it? There it is.
[2337.69s -> 2346.76s]  Beanbag Sonic making his first appearance ever in the rubble.
[2346.76s -> 2358.33s]  Top seed. Yep and Beanbag Sonic's partner.
[2358.33s -> 2366.22s]  Beanbag Sonic's partner. Are we gonna get to see another dab?
[2366.22s -> 2378.42s]  Oh that was a nice move. Is it the mosquito? It's not the mosquito.
[2378.42s -> 2385.14s]  It's somebody else. Somebody equally as important in the Monster Rancher
[2385.14s -> 2390.01s]  streams and the PlayStation 1 streams in general. Beanbag Sonic's
[2390.01s -> 2408.65s]  partner for the table match is Sweet Rhind.
[2411.48s -> 2414.68s]  Rewind to the Rhind. Ladies and gentlemen there is Sweet Rhind. Beanbag
[2414.68s -> 2425.14s]  Sonic is Sweet Rhind. Uh he is fucking huge.
[2425.14s -> 2433.46s]  Well they're very large. They're monsters. He's a giant wall. What do
[2433.46s -> 2438.73s]  you expect? And their opponents. From point blank.
[2438.73s -> 2444.17s]  That's Dr. Dawn. Can you guess who his
[2444.17s -> 2460.54s]  teammate will be? Who? That's Dr. Dawn from point blank.
[2460.54s -> 2465.37s]  You guys don't know who this is? Well then you're not gonna know his partner
[2465.37s -> 2473.83s]  Dr. Dan. Wait did nobody watch those streams?
[2473.83s -> 2485.66s]  I streamed that like four times. No wait no yeah yeah you did.
[2485.66s -> 2496.36s]  Yeah you guys were there for those streams. Did what did those streams
[2496.36s -> 2499.08s]  have low viewers? Well some of you guys know who
[2499.08s -> 2509.50s]  Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan is. It's not a clone. That's not a clone.
[2509.50s -> 2516.54s]  That's a different person. That's not a copy and paste. Go look
[2516.54s -> 2527.51s]  him up. Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan. I hope they fucking win. I hope they
[2527.51s -> 2541.58s]  fucking win. I hope they destroy these two.
[2541.58s -> 2545.02s]  Beanbag Sonic and Sweet Rhind versus Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan. PlayStation 1
[2545.02s -> 2554.20s]  battle. And it is a table match.
[2556.95s -> 2560.39s]  Dr. Dawn is is getting a table immediately. And Sweet Rhind
[2560.39s -> 2565.00s]  has got a table. The match has just begun. Beanbag Sonic.
[2565.00s -> 2568.12s]  Two tables are inside of the ring right now. Sweet Rhind is
[2568.12s -> 2572.57s]  huge. Sweet Rhind is too big. How do I edit this
[2572.57s -> 2576.25s]  in the middle of the stream and make him like 30% smaller? Dr. Dawn with a
[2576.25s -> 2582.54s]  with a nice spinning heel kick. Beanbag Sonic using his upper body
[2582.54s -> 2586.92s]  strength on Dr. Dan. I may have mixed the two of them up.
[2586.92s -> 2592.98s]  No clones by the way. Oh what a delicious right-handed punch
[2592.98s -> 2596.52s]  into the face of the world. Does Sweet Rhind have a face?
[2596.52s -> 2601.45s]  I can't even tell. I don't know. Does Sweet Rhind have a head?
[2601.45s -> 2604.57s]  DDT. They're a big fan of that. Wait now we got. Hold on. There's a problem here
[2604.57s -> 2606.97s]  though. Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan are both in the
[2606.97s -> 2611.98s]  ring. Beanbag Sonic is outside in pain.
[2611.98s -> 2617.54s]  All it takes is one of those tables to get set up and this could be over.
[2617.54s -> 2620.82s]  Yeah. Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan. They're not clones. Dr. Dan has
[2620.82s -> 2624.82s]  three inches of reach. A larger head. Oh right under the table
[2624.82s -> 2627.46s]  which is probably a better surface to land on.
[2627.46s -> 2631.82s]  Are we gonna see the Sweet Rhind's special move? I'm not sure. I did make
[2631.82s -> 2636.94s]  sure to put it in. I wonder if we'll see it. All right. I
[2636.94s -> 2640.22s]  can't tell who did the move there. What a
[2640.22s -> 2646.66s]  jumping scissor kick to Beanbag Sonic's stomach. Everybody talked all the shit
[2646.66s -> 2648.82s]  about Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan but they are
[2648.82s -> 2655.16s]  some of the top competitors we've seen in probably three years.
[2655.16s -> 2658.12s]  They weren't allowed to bring their guns. He accidentally just hurt his
[2658.12s -> 2662.46s]  partner there. I don't know how. They're I would
[2662.46s -> 2666.94s]  say at this point it's a 70-30 with Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan. Dr.
[2666.94s -> 2671.50s]  Dawn you just fucked up. What? What? You blew everything. You
[2671.50s -> 2674.54s]  absolutely blew it. Sweet Rhind that's like a four thousand pound
[2674.54s -> 2678.86s]  hunk of concrete on the top rope right now. Waiting for Dr. Dawn to get up.
[2678.86s -> 2682.38s]  While Dr. Dan has Beanbag Sonic up in a fireman's carry.
[2682.38s -> 2690.12s]  Beautifully executed. Well still waiting. Didn't even affect him.
[2690.12s -> 2693.32s]  He just got him with the tip of his toes. He just scratched under his
[2693.32s -> 2696.87s]  mustache with that kick. He waited so long to time that too
[2696.87s -> 2698.87s]  but they're not known for their agility.
[2698.87s -> 2702.39s]  A wall type monster rancher. Monsters are very
[2702.39s -> 2707.59s]  they're not they're known for strength not for finesse. Just going
[2707.59s -> 2713.35s]  onto the back of Sweet Rhind. Dr. Dan now
[2713.35s -> 2718.49s]  uh sorry there is a blockage in the way. I don't know what happened.
[2718.49s -> 2722.49s]  You have a giant person standing in front of the camera.
[2722.49s -> 2726.34s]  Uh-oh it has the momentum shifted here with Beanbag Sonic and Dr. Dawn
[2726.34s -> 2729.99s]  and Dr. Dan. No just when you thought it could have
[2729.99s -> 2733.37s]  changed. The reversals here seems to be the
[2733.45s -> 2737.32s]  reversal king is Dr. Dawn. I've probably said their names
[2737.32s -> 2742.52s]  backwards five times. They just dropped him on his head.
[2742.52s -> 2747.72s]  He just picked him up and just dropped him on his head. Beanbag Sonic
[2747.72s -> 2751.74s]  just absolutely oh he was going for a dab there. Never taunt in the middle of
[2751.74s -> 2753.34s]  a match. He was going for a dab and he got
[2753.34s -> 2759.90s]  caught by Dr. Dan. Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan now double teaming Sonic.
[2759.90s -> 2766.89s]  Caught him right in the back. Oh I'm not sure Dr. Dan's getting up
[2766.89s -> 2772.39s]  from that one. Throwing the table outside for some
[2772.39s -> 2777.13s]  strange reason. Sweet Ry now I have really no idea what they're
[2777.13s -> 2780.49s]  doing. It's the first person to go through a table that
[2780.49s -> 2784.90s]  their team loses. He's wrapping up both of his arms now.
[2784.90s -> 2790.39s]  Throwing him behind a German suplex with his arms tied behind his back.
[2790.39s -> 2794.55s]  The AI is his AI is really dumb. He's desperately trying to figure out
[2794.55s -> 2799.46s]  how to pick up the table. He got confused there. They must
[2799.46s -> 2803.66s]  what the hell was that? No don't don't don't set it up and then get
[2803.66s -> 2807.82s]  thrown through it Beanbag. This could be it. He doesn't move
[2807.82s -> 2809.82s]  through this table. This is it. This game over.
[2809.82s -> 2816.90s]  Beanbag Sonic. This is it. That's it. Powerbomb through the table.
[2816.90s -> 2826.76s]  Beanbag Sonic and Sweet Ry are your winners. Unbelievable super kick. That was
[2826.76s -> 2834.74s]  intense. That's what set it all up. And here's the finisher here. He just
[2834.74s -> 2840.89s]  throws him through the table into the corner. I think he may have
[2840.89s -> 2844.98s]  gotten injured there himself. It's all right. We're gonna give you
[2844.98s -> 2848.42s]  meat tonight. Well I'm gonna give I'll give a potato to Sweet Ry.
[2848.42s -> 2854.12s]  But he's getting meat and he's getting candy. There they are.
[2854.12s -> 2860.62s]  Two best friends from one of the best PlayStation 1 games ever.
[2860.62s -> 2864.66s]  Dr. Don and Dr. Dan thank you for participating.
[2864.66s -> 2871.58s]  But it's time for you to go home because you two are not in the rumble.
[2871.58s -> 2881.00s]  Go home. That was a fucking bismuth. You just got you just got
[2881.00s -> 2890.12s]  shit canned on the air. But anyways Beanbag Sonic and Sweet Ry are the
[2890.12s -> 2894.07s]  winners. Getting ever so closer to the main event here.
[2894.07s -> 2903.61s]  How many matches did I miss? This is the third one.
[2903.61s -> 2909.16s]  Or is it another way? This is yeah. So you got you got two more.
[2909.16s -> 2911.64s]  You get the next match and then you get the rumble. The rumble is going to be
[2911.64s -> 2918.57s]  like probably 30 or 40 minutes. Three fixed matches? I didn't fix anything.
[2918.57s -> 2923.40s]  I wanted Dr. Don and Dr. Dan to win. All right let's go. The next one.
[2923.40s -> 2932.94s]  What was the first one? The first one was the me versus pinwheel.
[2932.94s -> 2937.61s]  And I made it I made it look really easy. Second match was a
[2937.61s -> 2941.69s]  six-man ladder between the Sims murder house. Dr. Don and Dr. Dan
[2941.69s -> 2944.89s]  versus Sweet Ry and Beanbag Sonic. And then you got this one a
[2944.89s -> 2952.14s]  backstage brawl. Oh no okay I know I know what this is.
[2952.14s -> 2955.74s]  They make a lot of money. So I kind of let them
[2955.74s -> 2959.46s]  use the space here at the German arena. So
[2959.46s -> 2962.42s]  it's okay though. I don't think this will take very long.
[2962.42s -> 2974.22s]  So yeah this won't take very long. They're filming a YouTube video.
[2974.22s -> 2977.26s]  Oh that's Gary the fuck up and Bill crazy. I let them. Were they
[2977.26s -> 2979.98s]  supposed to come out? Yeah they're making like a hardcore
[2980.06s -> 2989.46s]  like we're fucked up YouTube video. Okay yeah oh so that's Gary the fuck up.
[2989.46s -> 2991.78s]  That's the cameraman. I'm not sure what they're doing back here though. I just
[2991.78s -> 2997.91s]  I let them use the space. They make like 30 million dollars a
[2997.91s -> 3003.72s]  year guys. I'm one of the most subscribed YouTube channels.
[3003.72s -> 3008.38s]  Now it's something I heard. I've been wondering about the feet there.
[3008.38s -> 3013.74s]  Apparently for a top YouTube dares thing that he did a long time ago.
[3013.74s -> 3017.61s]  He had his feet severed and had bird feet put on
[3017.61s -> 3022.31s]  surgically. I guess that he he's kind of fucked up. He's kind of a
[3022.31s -> 3031.03s]  fucked up guy. I dropped the camera. They're filming.
[3031.03s -> 3037.05s]  Oh that might look nice on the on the YouTube channel.
[3037.05s -> 3041.90s]  Oh that was insane. Wow he just jumped into the wall.
[3041.90s -> 3047.77s]  Smashing his face on the ground. These guys are fucked.
[3047.77s -> 3052.66s]  What else are they going to do for the video? Oh right into that. His
[3052.66s -> 3054.98s]  head just hit the top of that amp there.
[3054.98s -> 3062.68s]  What are they going to do again? Okay I took like a 60 or 70 thousand dollar
[3062.68s -> 3074.87s]  commission for this. Under the wall pool. No this is just
[3074.87s -> 3080.06s]  what they do. They jump into pools with fucking
[3080.06s -> 3085.38s]  like blood pools. They they shoot baseballs at each other out of a
[3085.38s -> 3088.94s]  pitching machine. I think number three or four most
[3088.94s -> 3096.97s]  subscribed like I said. I'm not sure like how this is gonna
[3096.97s -> 3100.73s]  Oh they fucked that one up. They'll take care of that in editing.
[3100.73s -> 3114.36s]  They'll edit that one out. Oh he's setting up the shot. He's setting up a
[3114.36s -> 3119.67s]  really good camera angle here. Oh right in the balls. Dude they just
[3119.67s -> 3132.54s]  got a ball shot. I can't wait to see that in a compilation.
[3132.54s -> 3153.56s]  He can't get dirt on him. Oh no that might be the last video he
[3153.56s -> 3164.74s]  has ever made. He can't just like stop at somebody's
[3164.74s -> 3173.80s]  head. He survived way worse. That's it.
[3173.80s -> 3177.16s]  You've been like you've jumped off a building before man.
[3177.16s -> 3184.30s]  You've been electrocuted. You can't like your head stepped on you die.
[3184.30s -> 3196.41s]  Oh I almost want to do it again because that's so
[3196.41s -> 3201.08s]  there's so many ways for them to do fuck them shit back here.
[3201.08s -> 3205.16s]  They can I may I checked a bunch of boxes for them to like fucking like
[3205.16s -> 3207.88s]  kill each other back here and you step on his head and that's it he's
[3207.88s -> 3216.30s]  dead. Oh no I can't. I can't. I can't do it.
[3216.30s -> 3227.35s]  I can't do a rematch. That ends this whole thing.
[3227.35s -> 3233.37s]  But I kind of can't do a rematch. You know what I mean?
[3233.37s -> 3237.69s]  We can do a rematch after. We'll do like an encore presentation.
[3237.69s -> 3244.12s]  He's still. All right that concludes that. Hopefully that
[3244.12s -> 3246.76s]  upload is good and it gets 50 million views and
[3246.76s -> 3252.68s]  they sell all their merch. This is the main event here.
[3253.24s -> 3262.79s]  Oh I muted it. I like almost broke something. Hold on I freaked out.
[3262.79s -> 3270.70s]  So uh something that you need to know is just because you were in the
[3270.70s -> 3276.17s]  pre-matches does not mean you are in the rumble.
[3276.17s -> 3286.28s]  I need to make I had to make room for a lot of fucking people. So
[3286.28s -> 3292.63s]  there are way there are a lot more characters that you have not seen.
[3292.63s -> 3295.43s]  I can't get over that. I was thinking they were gonna throw him through a
[3295.43s -> 3301.98s]  TV. I can't. I can't. I gotta like compose
[3301.98s -> 3310.52s]  myself here. All right I'm ready.
[3310.52s -> 3312.76s]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the main event. This is the Jerma Rumble
[3312.76s -> 3323.77s]  2018. I hope you enjoy it. Let's get it started. You know the
[3323.77s -> 3327.21s]  rules. Every minute or so another contestant
[3327.21s -> 3332.28s]  is going to come out to the ring. Uh there is no commentary so this
[3332.28s -> 3337.34s]  you cannot hear what this person is saying.
[3337.34s -> 3342.38s]  The first 10 usually have an incredibly incredibly high disadvantage
[3342.38s -> 3346.68s]  but it is very possible. Welcome to the Jerma Rumble 2018
[3346.68s -> 3354.34s]  stream edition. They're all stream editions at this point.
[3354.34s -> 3362.09s]  Over the top ropes you're out. That's the only way. That is the only way.
[3362.09s -> 3373.67s]  30 contestants. 30. That's right. 30. Mic muted. Well her mic is muted.
[3373.67s -> 3378.55s]  That's fine. Mine's not. Mine's open. I wonder who the first
[3378.55s -> 3382.31s]  contestant is. It's all random. It's completely randomized so I have no
[3382.31s -> 3385.35s]  idea. I'm watching this at the same time
[3385.43s -> 3389.64s]  as you guys. The first contestant coming out.
[3389.64s -> 3395.58s]  Why is there music? Why is there music for Jax?
[3395.58s -> 3403.50s]  There shouldn't be any music but there's Jax, the first contestant.
[3403.50s -> 3407.58s]  Making his first ever appearance. One of the most highly skilled video game
[3407.58s -> 3419.32s]  players to ever live. He had an embroidery down I see.
[3419.32s -> 3426.76s]  That's a pretty nice embroidery. I will say it looks pretty nice.
[3426.76s -> 3431.37s]  Can we see some Jax's in the chat? I would like to see it maybe.
[3431.37s -> 3435.67s]  We already see them. He's at a severe disadvantage though.
[3435.67s -> 3444.66s]  Because Jax is number one which is nearly impossible.
[3444.66s -> 3453.56s]  Maybe he'll go all the way. We've seen stranger things for sure.
[3453.56s -> 3458.23s]  Tag me in. No that's not going to happen. Contestant number two.
[3458.23s -> 3465.70s]  The first two. Who is number two? I'm excited. I'm ready.
[3465.70s -> 3469.72s]  That's Sweet Rind. Sweet Rind is contestant number two.
[3469.72s -> 3474.87s]  Just coming off of a victory with Beanbag Sonic.
[3474.87s -> 3486.66s]  Sweet Rind and Jax are the first two. I wonder how long it's going to take.
[3486.66s -> 3491.77s]  David and Goliath. Well this is Jax we're talking about.
[3491.77s -> 3496.10s]  This ain't just some shitty regular Jerma. You know.
[3496.10s -> 3500.34s]  This is my alternate personality. Jax. 2018 Germania.
[3500.34s -> 3505.21s]  Jerma rumble has started. Oh game almost crashed at the very beginning.
[3505.21s -> 3511.03s]  That would have been real bad. But we got Jax and Sweet Rind in at
[3511.03s -> 3512.95s]  the very beginning here trying to get his
[3512.95s -> 3516.87s]  up the leg there. Nice throwing him backwards.
[3516.87s -> 3520.23s]  And we already have another contestant coming in here.
[3520.23s -> 3524.63s]  Already. It hasn't even been 20 seconds. Contestant number three coming in as
[3524.63s -> 3530.06s]  Jax does a patented Jerma move. Garrett's coming in next from the
[3530.06s -> 3538.06s]  Sims murder house as contestant number three. There he is.
[3538.06s -> 3541.10s]  Making his way. Oh nice fireman's carry. Tossing him over the shoulder
[3541.10s -> 3544.90s]  there. Blocks that punch. Jax is going to be in it. I would
[3544.90s -> 3548.26s]  triple or quadruple or septuple team Jax.
[3548.26s -> 3553.08s]  He has the highest stats in the whole game. He's literally unbeatable.
[3553.08s -> 3558.90s]  He is 100% unbeatable. I'd like to see what they do here.
[3558.90s -> 3563.59s]  As Garrett is just taunting the crowd. Here comes contestant number four.
[3563.59s -> 3569.46s]  It's Pinwheel. Pinwheel with a small eye.
[3569.46s -> 3576.20s]  He just picked him up and made him do a leg drop onto Sweet Rind's head.
[3576.20s -> 3580.12s]  That was a tag team effort there. That was not somebody doing a move.
[3580.12s -> 3584.06s]  That was an actual double team on Sweet Rind. So you
[3584.06s -> 3586.62s]  got Jax, Pinwheel, Garrett and Sweet Rind
[3586.62s -> 3589.42s]  in the ring right now and Sweet Rind is going to try to eliminate the
[3589.42s -> 3591.98s]  competition here. Can Sweet Rind get rid of Jax?
[3591.98s -> 3596.07s]  Is Jax going to go out first ever? No that can't be. It's impossible.
[3596.07s -> 3600.26s]  It's impossible. It's impossible. I told you. Here comes contestant number
[3600.26s -> 3605.51s]  five. Lou. Oh of course I know who Lou is.
[3605.51s -> 3611.64s]  That's Lou Elberton from the Elberton family.
[3611.64s -> 3617.67s]  Jeremy's Uncle Lou. Jax and Uncle Lou both incredibly powerful.
[3617.67s -> 3621.94s]  He was so excited to come here. He was so excited he was going to make
[3621.94s -> 3624.98s]  his first appearance and he's going to eliminate Pinwheel
[3624.98s -> 3628.86s]  for Jeremy because he knows he hates his fucking character and he hates all the
[3628.86s -> 3632.52s]  chat memes. No he's not strong enough and without
[3632.52s -> 3635.88s]  even thinking Sweet Rind has been eliminated
[3635.88s -> 3641.24s]  and now we've got Jax giving a powerbomb and here comes Glueman.
[3641.24s -> 3647.18s]  Glueman making his appearance. Jax seems to for some reason have powerbombed
[3647.18s -> 3652.23s]  Uncle Lou and he's... Glueman is going to go right for Jax.
[3652.23s -> 3655.51s]  He is certain that if he wants to win this rumble for the first time ever
[3655.51s -> 3659.03s]  he's been a part of every single rumble. He has to take out the
[3659.03s -> 3665.03s]  strongest competitor but it's going to be very difficult for Glueman.
[3665.03s -> 3669.91s]  We've got a very very full ring here. Sweet Rind first to be eliminated.
[3669.91s -> 3674.15s]  Jax with a jumping drop kick on Glueman. This is going to be a tough one
[3674.15s -> 3678.68s]  and Dr. Schmeichsen. The lie detector doctor
[3678.68s -> 3682.44s]  making his first ever appearance as well. A lot of first timers here. Dr.
[3682.44s -> 3685.85s]  Schmeichsen trying to go for a diving face
[3685.85s -> 3689.02s]  butt but he did not make it. Garrett now
[3689.02s -> 3691.10s]  is going to get over the top rubs. Is it possible they're going to double team?
[3691.10s -> 3693.82s]  Garrett here. Lou in pinwheel. There he goes.
[3693.82s -> 3702.54s]  Garrett has been eliminated by Uncle Lou in pinwheel. Dr. Schmeichsen,
[3702.54s -> 3709.24s]  Lou, Jax, Glueman in pinwheel. Here comes another contestant. I'm hearing
[3709.24s -> 3713.80s]  a lot of boos. Oh they put... what is that Bill? Oh
[3713.80s -> 3719.45s]  did he get up? Did he actually get up? It's Bill crazy!
[3719.45s -> 3722.89s]  He's actually not dead. Dr. Schmeichsen
[3722.89s -> 3726.94s]  is about to eliminate Jax. No it's impossible.
[3726.94s -> 3730.54s]  It's it's literally not even possible. Good luck.
[3730.54s -> 3735.46s]  He's the most under speeded video game champion to ever live. Bill crazy now
[3735.46s -> 3742.01s]  has Uncle Lou in a powerbomb! Is he gone? Jax did not like that.
[3742.01s -> 3753.35s]  His Uncle Lou has been eliminated. Oh my god. Is he gonna do it?
[3753.35s -> 3760.90s]  Manchester from... he's naked. He's naked. Manchester from oblivion
[3760.90s -> 3763.62s]  is going to get instantly eliminated. Bill crazy is gone.
[3763.62s -> 3767.90s]  Lou is gone. Jax doing some fancy footwork. Taunting the crowd. He knows
[3767.90s -> 3771.58s]  he is an indisputable champion. He'll never be beaten.
[3771.58s -> 3776.47s]  Nice right hand on a Majestank or the Flu for those of you that are keeping
[3776.47s -> 3780.50s]  track. Pinwheel now two weird characters from very different games.
[3780.50s -> 3785.08s]  Is it possible? Will pinwheel be eliminated by? No not by Majestank.
[3785.08s -> 3787.24s]  The Flu. Dr. Schmeichsen now. He's got a
[3787.24s -> 3790.20s]  cure for the Flu. It's called two right hands and an elbow to the back
[3790.20s -> 3793.08s]  of the skull. He's got a cure for the Flu.
[3793.85s -> 3802.62s]  Ladies and gentlemen coming in here next is the Car Valet from Sleeping Dogs.
[3802.62s -> 3808.36s]  Somebody order a car? I think so. There he is.
[3808.36s -> 3813.08s]  The Car Valet. Oh and immediately gets stopped by Glue Man.
[3813.08s -> 3822.10s]  We got the Dr. Schmeichsen now who seemed to have. Oh no.
[3822.10s -> 3826.18s]  Wow is is is Car is the Car Valet gonna actually eliminate Glue Man? This
[3826.18s -> 3828.42s]  would be so sad. This would be so sad for Glue Man.
[3828.42s -> 3831.46s]  He's tried so many times. He's tried... Jax is about to be
[3831.46s -> 3834.25s]  eliminated by Pinwheel. Don't you fucking dare.
[3834.33s -> 3842.47s]  No. Yes it's impossible. Don't do it. Do not. Pinwheel do not eliminate Jax.
[3842.47s -> 3847.56s]  Please god. Thank god. Here comes the green screen.
[3847.56s -> 3850.36s]  Put whatever character you want here. This is the green screen from last
[3850.36s -> 3853.67s]  weekend. If you want to put uh like Super
[3853.67s -> 3858.15s]  Mario here or you want to put you know like the fat guy or like
[3858.15s -> 3863.03s]  Peter Griffin or something. He's there for you. He's marked. He's huge.
[3863.03s -> 3865.83s]  Well the green screen is huge. Dr. Schmeichsen now going
[3865.83s -> 3869.10s]  with a couple of kicks into Jax's face.
[3869.10s -> 3876.76s]  There are so many people in this ring. It's actually getting ridiculous.
[3876.76s -> 3882.28s]  What? Is that actually Sans from Undertale?
[3882.28s -> 3889.90s]  That's Sans from Undertale. There he is. There are too many people in the
[3889.90s -> 3892.06s]  ring. Sans making his first appearance in
[3892.06s -> 3896.38s]  Gerber Rumble. One, two, three, four, five, six.
[3896.38s -> 3900.30s]  There are eight people in the ring. Is Glue Man gonna get his
[3900.30s -> 3904.14s]  elimination here on Dr. Schmeichsen? This is a this is
[3904.14s -> 3908.52s]  assault on another person. Oh but he reverses it. Green
[3908.60s -> 3912.30s]  screen now. We got the car valets in a bad spot.
[3912.30s -> 3917.66s]  Dr. Schmeichsen now trying to. Oh no. Green screen. The green screen almost
[3917.66s -> 3920.78s]  just eliminated Sans in what seems like three or four
[3920.78s -> 3924.74s]  seconds. How do you fight a green screen?
[3924.74s -> 3928.47s]  You just get tangled up in it. You can't even go near it. You're gonna
[3928.47s -> 3930.87s]  cast shadows on it. People are gonna scream at you.
[3930.87s -> 3934.94s]  Glue Man though trying again. Trying to do it. No.
[3934.94s -> 3938.22s]  No eliminations with eight people. Glue Man reverses it now.
[3938.22s -> 3942.81s]  He's gonna push him out. There's a lot of possibilities here.
[3942.81s -> 3949.75s]  Jax just eliminated the car valet. That's another elimination from Jax.
[3949.75s -> 3953.75s]  He was the first one in. Will he be the last one in as well as
[3953.75s -> 3960.06s]  go after Pinwheel? Dump him out of here. Jax is unbeatable
[3960.06s -> 3964.31s]  and I mean that. I mean it. And he's not gonna lose to Pinwheel.
[3964.31s -> 3969.35s]  No like old shit Gerber beat Pinwheel. Jax cannot lose to Pinwheel.
[3969.35s -> 3973.18s]  That would. Don't do it. Please don't do it. Fight back Jax.
[3973.18s -> 3976.38s]  Do so. The Jax. There we go. Thank god.
[3976.38s -> 3982.70s]  The green screen now has got Dr. Schmeichsen while Sands is in the
[3982.70s -> 3987.00s]  corner. Is he gonna go for elimination? I wonder
[3987.00s -> 3990.04s]  what character is about to eliminate Dr. Schmeichsen.
[3990.04s -> 3998.12s]  He's got a chance. No. No. He's not gonna.
[3998.12s -> 4002.44s]  A shooting star press from Magistake and there goes Dr. Schmeichsen.
[4002.44s -> 4005.82s]  Dr. Schmeichsen is gone. Pinwheel is just
[4005.82s -> 4010.14s]  taunting. Pinwheel is taunting everybody. Sands did not like that.
[4010.22s -> 4014.60s]  Sands is gonna come up with Pinwheel. Now gets chopped in the face
[4014.60s -> 4017.72s]  for his efforts. Here comes. What is with the moves
[4017.72s -> 4022.28s]  from Magistake? Another competitor it seems like ages since we've seen
[4022.28s -> 4027.10s]  somebody new. And it's Beanbag Sonic coming in
[4027.10s -> 4031.61s]  somewhere about at the midway point. That's a pretty good place to be.
[4031.61s -> 4035.19s]  Beanbag Sonic making his first ever appearance in the rumble.
[4035.19s -> 4039.03s]  What happened? Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Did Jax. Wait. Hold on.
[4039.03s -> 4045.08s]  Hey. No. Hold on. Jax. Who. I didn't even see it.
[4045.08s -> 4048.52s]  Who eliminated Jax and Glooman? Those are the two
[4048.52s -> 4054.38s]  favorites. They're not gonna win. Jax and Glooman are both gone.
[4054.38s -> 4058.09s]  Did the green screen eliminate Jax? No fucking way.
[4058.09s -> 4063.40s]  God damn it. I was looking at like. I was looking at.
[4063.40s -> 4067.99s]  They're both doing the same animation. There it goes.
[4067.99s -> 4073.06s]  Jax and Glooman. Glooman will never win. He's just never gonna win.
[4073.06s -> 4076.58s]  We'll take your pick in here. I'm rooting for Beanbag Sonic.
[4076.58s -> 4082.06s]  I think he deserves it. And Beanbag Sonic and Sands both
[4082.14s -> 4087.58s]  equal weight here. Sonic is fresh. Beanbag Sonic is brand
[4087.58s -> 4093.51s]  new so no fatigue while Sands. What does Sonic have in mind here?
[4093.51s -> 4100.82s]  What is he doing? Beanbag Sonic. You hear that crowd scream.
[4100.82s -> 4105.77s]  Is Beanbag Sonic going to go around and eliminate every person?
[4105.77s -> 4109.53s]  That is elimination number one for Beanbag Sonic.
[4109.53s -> 4114.74s]  Dropped him on his head. Here comes another contestant all the way from
[4114.74s -> 4119.82s]  the one stream that everybody hated. Soon to be on a Christmas special.
[4119.82s -> 4127.24s]  That's BF Bugleberry. Resident scary storyteller.
[4127.24s -> 4131.77s]  There goes Pinwheel. The green screen is too strong.
[4131.77s -> 4136.22s]  The green screen is too strong. I don't know why it's this powerful.
[4136.22s -> 4141.24s]  BF Bugleberry. Sands is gone. Green screen now looking like the
[4141.24s -> 4148.10s]  person to beat here. Defense is still outside.
[4148.10s -> 4152.34s]  Beanbag Sonic. The green screen. Willem Dafoe is number 15 at the halfway
[4152.34s -> 4154.66s]  mark. We have made it to halfway through the
[4154.66s -> 4159.26s]  2018 rumble. And there is Willem Dafoe. Something of a
[4160.14s -> 4165.62s]  scientist. There he is. Half of one of Jeremy's emotes.
[4165.62s -> 4168.66s]  And please get rid of the fucking green screen. Do it, Dafoe.
[4168.66s -> 4173.16s]  Channel the goblin. You can do it. Channel the green goblin. He's green.
[4173.16s -> 4179.40s]  He didn't even want to do it. He didn't care. Why did you do that?
[4179.40s -> 4182.68s]  Let the goblin take over. Don't just let him eliminate you. What are you
[4182.68s -> 4189.56s]  doing? No. Bugleberry is gone. Bugleberry.
[4189.56s -> 4192.60s]  I wanted him to win. Bugleberry is gone. Gets eliminated by Beanbag Sonic.
[4192.60s -> 4199.53s]  And in comes binary man. 0-1-1-0-1-10-0-0-2-2.
[4199.53s -> 4206.76s]  From the detective stream. He's incredibly strong.
[4206.76s -> 4210.28s]  He's not. Oh no, he's not. Is Beanbag Sonic about to-
[4210.28s -> 4219.85s]  Yeah, binary man 0-1-1-0-1-0-0-1-1. Welcome to the rumble. Nice cartwheel by
[4219.85s -> 4226.15s]  the green goblin, aka Willem Dafoe. Just testing the mat, I guess. Beanbag
[4226.15s -> 4230.14s]  Sonic, it would be a shame if binary man eliminated you.
[4230.14s -> 4233.86s]  It's all right. Because I think I just heard something.
[4233.86s -> 4236.02s]  I just heard that. I've waited. The green screen's about to come out. Green
[4236.02s -> 4239.38s]  screen's going out. Maybe wall dad's coming in.
[4239.38s -> 4245.14s]  No, it's- Oh, what a right hand by wall dad. I just heard a sledgehammer break
[4245.14s -> 4247.38s]  over on the side of the wall there, and I
[4247.38s -> 4253.08s]  I heard it, but what is that for a t-shirt? What is that?
[4253.08s -> 4256.68s]  Okay, he's wearing his son's Minecon shirt.
[4256.68s -> 4260.49s]  Okay, that's fine. I mean, he has to find a way to put clothes on.
[4260.49s -> 4268.79s]  He's hiding the wall. Wall dad from House Flipper. What's that smell?
[4269.67s -> 4274.39s]  That smells delicious. That smells kind of like a red blend wine to me.
[4274.39s -> 4278.23s]  Binary man has been eliminated as red blend. The wine glass
[4278.23s -> 4284.44s]  with the cork head comes in. Binary man is gone. Beanbag Sonic is still in.
[4284.44s -> 4287.48s]  Magistank is still in. Willem Dafoe is still in. Green screen.
[4287.48s -> 4291.34s]  Sonic is about to get eliminated by the red blend. Oh, that would be
[4291.34s -> 4297.54s]  unfortunate. It does taste great, though.
[4297.54s -> 4301.78s]  Beanbag Sonic is on the ropes. No, wall dad
[4301.78s -> 4306.25s]  misses a punch there from the green screen. Oh, and here comes Adam Sandler.
[4306.25s -> 4313.75s]  No, no, no. The green screen needs to be eliminated. Adam Sandler
[4313.75s -> 4317.35s]  going right for the green screen. Using his comedic comedy technique.
[4317.35s -> 4325.05s]  Will he eliminate the green screen? Pick him up. He's fired up after that
[4325.05s -> 4328.10s]  loss. Adam Sandler, and there goes the
[4328.10s -> 4330.42s]  red blend. Beanbag Sonic has eliminated another
[4330.42s -> 4340.04s]  contestant. Red blend is now gone, but it is good. So you got Willem Dafoe,
[4340.04s -> 4342.68s]  Beanbag Sonic, green screen, Adam Sandler, and Magistank,
[4342.68s -> 4347.35s]  except maybe not for long. Big drop kick there by Willem Dafoe.
[4347.35s -> 4355.30s]  Don't. The green screen is about to eliminate another person.
[4355.30s -> 4361.86s]  No, no. Somebody has to stop him. Somebody stop the green screen before
[4361.86s -> 4364.98s]  he eliminates like 50 people. Hopefully it'll be Elvis.
[4364.98s -> 4368.90s]  Hopefully it'll be Elvis from Las Vegas, Nevada.
[4368.90s -> 4373.85s]  Come on, get in there, Elvis. Jerma's move to Vegas
[4373.85s -> 4378.33s]  has proved to be successful. Elvis, of course, and look at how many
[4378.33s -> 4380.73s]  people it takes to try to get the green screen out.
[4380.73s -> 4384.25s]  You need three. Elvis, get over. Don't touch Beanbag Sonic.
[4384.25s -> 4387.69s]  Go after the green screen. He's unbeatable. He's the Jex of this
[4387.69s -> 4391.93s]  competition. What are you thinking? Nice reverse. Then there goes Beanbag
[4391.93s -> 4394.33s]  Sonic. Elvis eliminated Beanbag Sonic.
[4394.33s -> 4400.49s]  Sad day, but he may eliminate the green screen. That's unfortunate.
[4400.49s -> 4404.10s]  Oh, fucking great. How did he get in here?
[4404.10s -> 4412.20s]  Really? He fucking, he hacked my, he hacked my fucking game.
[4412.20s -> 4417.78s]  Put himself in. Fucking loser. That's GrillmasterxBDQ.
[4417.78s -> 4421.99s]  The guy that I made a video with or something like that.
[4421.99s -> 4426.41s]  He's another, like, screamer. He sucks.
[4427.32s -> 4430.60s]  This is his, like, haha, ultimate, like, I got you, right? Like, you come
[4430.60s -> 4434.79s]  in with the Jerma Rumble. Like, my fucking thing.
[4434.87s -> 4439.98s]  I don't even know what he made of stats, but that's fucking annoying.
[4439.98s -> 4443.90s]  Anyways, GrillmasterxBDQ, an old cooking channel from YouTube, is
[4443.90s -> 4449.85s]  going to be welcomed by GaryTheFuckUp. Maybe GaryTheFuckUp can
[4449.85s -> 4453.94s]  get some more YouTube footage of him hurting people,
[4453.94s -> 4456.98s]  as he's got Willem Dafoe over the shoulder here. No, gets reversed by
[4456.98s -> 4462.71s]  Willem Dafoe. Elvis, Grillmaster, the green
[4462.71s -> 4468.23s]  screen, GaryTheFuckUp, Magistank, and speaking of Grillmaster, is he
[4468.23s -> 4473.34s]  going to eliminate Elvis? Elvis is not eliminated. He's still in
[4473.34s -> 4479.19s]  the ring, and here comes Otto. Otto the Duxen. It's taken me four or
[4479.19s -> 4486.52s]  five years to put him in, but there he is. There's Otto.
[4487.51s -> 4492.57s]  Hey, come on. Like, please let him get in the ring for a second.
[4492.57s -> 4496.09s]  GaryTheFuckUp is gone. Willem Dafoe with a Lariat.
[4496.09s -> 4500.49s]  An absolutely hellish Lariat to GaryTheFuckUp.
[4500.49s -> 4504.17s]  Both the duo of Bill Crazy and GaryTheFuckUp are gone.
[4504.17s -> 4507.85s]  Otto comes in. The longest person that's been in here, the green screen, has been
[4507.85s -> 4509.69s]  in here the absolute longest. It's been
[4509.69s -> 4514.57s]  almost 20 straight minutes. Oh, right. I forgot.
[4514.57s -> 4523.86s]  There comes Jerma Raptor. The most embarrassing thing I've ever done
[4523.86s -> 4527.54s]  is now in the ring. I feel like he deserved to be there, and I would make
[4527.54s -> 4530.63s]  I would be so happy if you threw this guy out right now.
[4530.63s -> 4536.12s]  I would be ecstatic if Jerma Raptor threw Grillmaster XBBQ out right now.
[4536.12s -> 4539.45s]  What do you do? Are you using it as an exercise ball? Are you going to let
[4539.45s -> 4543.13s]  him do that to you? Really? Willem Dafoe taking a
[4543.13s -> 4548.49s]  little bit of a break as the green screen just knows how strong
[4548.49s -> 4551.13s]  he is and knows that no one stands a chance.
[4551.13s -> 4554.65s]  He just pushed Jerma Raptor, and thank God.
[4554.65s -> 4559.10s]  Thank you, Elvis. Elvis just eliminated Grillmaster XBBQ
[4559.10s -> 4562.38s]  to never return. They'll never be in another Rumble ever again. I'm
[4562.38s -> 4565.18s]  deleting the character. Is he eliminating himself? What the
[4565.18s -> 4570.57s]  fuck was that? What? What did Otto just do? Did
[4570.57s -> 4573.29s]  Otto just fake him? Why didn't you put a Raptor?
[4573.29s -> 4578.01s]  Just jump over the ropes for no reason. Well, it's okay.
[4578.01s -> 4581.77s]  Jerma Raptor will get replaced by another Jerma character. Here comes
[4581.77s -> 4586.46s]  Odd Michael. You can't put capes on in this game for some reason, but
[4586.46s -> 4589.56s]  there's Odd Michael. This is going to get interesting. There
[4589.56s -> 4592.36s]  goes Willem Dafoe. Magistank throws Willem Dafoe over the top ropes.
[4592.36s -> 4600.18s]  You've got Elvis and Odd Michael in the same spot. Will they work together?
[4600.18s -> 4606.14s]  I would love to see a Jerma Odd Michael and an Elvis collaboration here.
[4606.14s -> 4609.02s]  Going after his own dog while the fucking green screen is about to throw
[4609.02s -> 4615.62s]  another person over the top ropes. Thankfully, Elvis ain't down with that
[4615.62s -> 4621.43s]  as he breaks out of what could have been a terrible situation for him.
[4621.43s -> 4623.67s]  No, they're fighting each other. Don't fight each other. You should be
[4623.67s -> 4628.15s]  helping each other. The three of you. Yes, just get taunted by the green
[4628.15s -> 4634.54s]  screen while he just does a boot party on Elvis. Magistank is still
[4634.54s -> 4638.38s]  in the ear clap. He just crushed it. He just gave him a
[4638.38s -> 4642.63s]  migrate. Otto now has Odd Michael while the green screen,
[4642.63s -> 4647.70s]  thank god, has not eliminated a seventh person potentially.
[4647.70s -> 4653.02s]  No, there it is. There goes Elvis by the green screen, but I have high hopes
[4653.02s -> 4661.74s]  for the Nintendo Labo. I have extraordinarily high hopes.
[4661.74s -> 4666.15s]  Taking a long time to get in here. There he is. The Nintendo Switch Labo.
[4666.15s -> 4669.11s]  And he just just goes right after Jerma for making such a terribly
[4669.11s -> 4673.64s]  boring stream three times. Make sure you do it on the fold lines.
[4673.64s -> 4677.74s]  Crease the fold lines well when you throw him out. Otherwise, what the
[4677.74s -> 4685.26s]  fuck are you doing, Odd Michael? There was absolutely no reason to do that.
[4685.26s -> 4689.08s]  This would be pretty poetic if Odd Michael were to be eliminated by the
[4689.08s -> 4691.98s]  Labo as the green screen is in a very bad
[4691.98s -> 4699.91s]  position for the Quiet Man to come in. Quiet Man number 27. 27. In comes the
[4699.91s -> 4707.96s]  Quiet Man from literally the worst game ever as
[4707.96s -> 4712.12s]  he picks up Odd Michael over the shoulder. No, a reversal.
[4712.12s -> 4719.38s]  Quiet Man is one of the last three. Get him out of here.
[4719.38s -> 4722.84s]  Get the green screen out of here of all the people.
[4722.84s -> 4725.96s]  I can't fucking believe he's still in this. He's about to throw a magic tank
[4725.96s -> 4730.22s]  over the top ropes. Is it gonna be possible? There he goes.
[4730.22s -> 4735.91s]  Chuck Schnoswell number 28. Will somebody stop him?
[4735.91s -> 4743.50s]  Somebody please. He's just, he's just the new Jax.
[4743.50s -> 4748.84s]  Chuck Schnoswell coming in. Will he be the hero that we all hope for?
[4748.84s -> 4753.35s]  Come on, Chuck. He feels the crowd. He feels the energy of the audience.
[4753.35s -> 4757.59s]  Will Chuck Schnoswell eliminate the most impossible to eliminate Contender?
[4757.59s -> 4761.13s]  He's got him over the top just barely pushing his legs.
[4761.13s -> 4766.58s]  Come on, Chuck. Use the fucking nose. Use your nose, Chuck.
[4766.58s -> 4770.90s]  Get it! Get it! No!
[4770.90s -> 4774.70s]  Otto is about to throw Odd Michael over the top ropes.
[4774.70s -> 4780.52s]  And here comes a Hornet from the fucking wall of the old house.
[4780.52s -> 4785.67s]  If there's anybody that can do it, it's definitely him. And the Quiet Man
[4785.67s -> 4789.27s]  is about to throw. No, thank God it was just a scoopslam. Chuck Schnoswell
[4789.27s -> 4796.54s]  now for that insolence. And that's
[4798.07s -> 4810.02s]  come on. No. Well, somebody sprayed the Hornet.
[4810.02s -> 4815.45s]  He's gone. That was all it took. Just swatted him. What an
[4815.45s -> 4819.61s]  overhead press by the Quiet Man. On to Otto the Dog.
[4819.61s -> 4823.94s]  Odd Michael trying to put work into the green screen.
[4823.94s -> 4829.32s]  Huge chokeslam. And there goes Odd. No. There goes. Who the fuck was it?
[4829.32s -> 4833.61s]  Who just got thrown out? Otto. Oh God. It's Otto the Dog has been
[4833.61s -> 4838.02s]  eliminated by the Quiet Man. And the Quiet Man is about to
[4838.02s -> 4844.09s]  powerbomb the Labo. He is incredibly strong. Green screen
[4844.09s -> 4847.37s]  still cannot get thrown out after being double teamed.
[4847.37s -> 4852.47s]  We only have two more people coming in. Nice miss, Odd Michael.
[4852.47s -> 4858.82s]  You're shitty Dr. Strange. This booze coming in.
[4858.82s -> 4862.49s]  Could this be? Can we get the last person?
[4862.49s -> 4869.83s]  The last person is Fireman. What is he?
[4869.83s -> 4875.45s]  Holy shit. He's fresh and he's the last contestant.
[4875.45s -> 4880.89s]  Get rid of that fucking green screen. The green screen is dazed.
[4880.89s -> 4888.46s]  He's tired. He's confused. Fireman. Oh no. Just barely. You didn't do it.
[4888.46s -> 4891.42s]  I think he's so stupid. He thinks he did it.
[4891.42s -> 4894.30s]  He thought he eliminated him. He couldn't tell he was invisible. Somebody
[4894.30s -> 4897.88s]  keyed him out. Somebody keyed the green screen out. No.
[4897.88s -> 4904.62s]  There goes Odd Michael. Fireman fighting for his life.
[4904.62s -> 4908.30s]  The green screen just can't seem to do it. One of these contestants will
[4908.30s -> 4911.26s]  win. One of these contestants will win. The
[4911.26s -> 4913.34s]  Labo has just been limited by Chuck Schnauzwell.
[4913.34s -> 4917.50s]  Fireman green screen to the Quiet Man. One of these four will be your 2018
[4917.50s -> 4922.46s]  champion. It's just absolute bullshit that he
[4922.46s -> 4927.16s]  can just be keyed out whenever he wants. He can turn invisible.
[4927.16s -> 4929.00s]  He can turn into other people. He can turn into you
[4929.00s -> 4934.71s]  and you think you're in the ring. What a reversal by Fireman. Will
[4934.71s -> 4939.27s]  Fireman come in as the last spot and clean up the whole ring?
[4939.27s -> 4945.53s]  No. Not quite. Quiet Man gets dropped on a knee there.
[4945.53s -> 4949.85s]  What is he pointing to? I think he's just trying to get some energy here.
[4949.85s -> 4953.69s]  Chuck Schnauzwell doing a dab from one of his best friends, Beanbag Sonic. They
[4953.69s -> 4957.53s]  become really close friends actually since those videos. And can Chuck
[4957.53s -> 4961.34s]  Schnauzwell with the strength of 50. No.
[4961.34s -> 4967.75s]  No. With the strength of 50 bats. Being able to throw him over.
[4967.75s -> 4971.69s]  Uh-oh. Quiet Man with a big right hand.
[4971.69s -> 4974.97s]  We've got to see an elimination here. We got to see a green screen
[4974.97s -> 4980.14s]  Quiet Man elimination. Chuck Schnauzwell with a huge suplex.
[4980.14s -> 4985.26s]  You've got two fan favorites. A character that I put in
[4985.26s -> 4989.61s]  because of a stream I did three days ago and the green screen.
[4989.61s -> 4995.99s]  Who is going to win? Chuck Schnauzwell now in the air. The green screen
[4995.99s -> 4999.77s]  just seems to pick up all these characters like toys
[4999.77s -> 5004.15s]  as Fireman is going to see an opportunity to pick up Quiet Man and
[5004.15s -> 5007.96s]  maybe get something done here. Scooping him up over the shoulder.
[5007.96s -> 5013.11s]  Throwing him backwards into the ground. Oh knees to the face.
[5013.11s -> 5016.98s]  That's got to hurt though. He might get burnt. The top of the head
[5016.98s -> 5021.43s]  of Fireman is very very strong now and I don't know what he's doing here.
[5021.43s -> 5026.78s]  He's working trying to break his leg as the green screen
[5026.78s -> 5029.82s]  has no gets reversed by Fireman. Not in a good position.
[5029.82s -> 5034.12s]  Oh Quiet Man has Chuck on the this is not good for Chuck.
[5034.12s -> 5038.22s]  Quiet Man could see an elimination here and will be down to three.
[5038.22s -> 5042.89s]  Fireman is awaiting the consciousness to it.
[5042.89s -> 5048.41s]  Come on Fireman. Oh no. He gets stopped by a stray punch
[5048.49s -> 5057.16s]  by Chuck Schnauzwell. I will say though these four
[5057.16s -> 5061.08s]  they're giving it all they got. Chuck is just getting punched. Have to punch
[5061.08s -> 5067.43s]  in the face over and over again. Thank god he's got that nose armor and
[5067.43s -> 5072.12s]  now Chuck is in the grasp of the green screen.
[5072.12s -> 5077.90s]  No man. No thing. No person has been able to
[5077.90s -> 5083.03s]  stop him. As you see the Quiet Man. Chuck Schnauzwell is gone. It's
[5083.03s -> 5088.30s]  Quiet Man. No. Thank goodness. Come on Fireman.
[5088.30s -> 5097.00s]  Fireman stop it. Fireman no. No Fireman. Do what you can. No. Oh no.
[5097.00s -> 5105.02s]  It's the green screen versus Quiet Man.
[5105.02s -> 5110.52s]  How many eliminations has the green screen done?
[5110.52s -> 5117.58s]  This is like 12 eliminations. Is he gonna throw him over the ropes
[5117.58s -> 5124.63s]  right now? There's no way. I can't. I would be so
[5124.63s -> 5131.59s]  shocked if the Quiet Man eliminates the green screen. What?
[5131.59s -> 5135.43s]  Oh that's it. That's gonna be it. That's it. The winner of the 2018
[5135.43s -> 5142.47s]  Rumble is the green screen. I can't believe it. He destroyed
[5142.47s -> 5149.32s]  everybody. It wasn't even a chance. Nobody had a chance.
[5149.32s -> 5162.34s]  Not. Nobody could even match his strength.
[5162.34s -> 5173.32s]  The green screen. There you go. Yep. See you at WrestleMania. This is
[5173.32s -> 5179.32s]  WrestleMania. He lasted a very very long time too.
[5179.32s -> 5184.39s]  That was so long. He was like number one. Like 11 or 12
[5184.39s -> 5186.63s]  or something. He stayed in the whole time.
[5186.71s -> 5197.75s]  Holy shit. But it could be anybody. This could be
[5197.75s -> 5211.48s]  anybody. Correct the timeline. I can't. That is the timeline.
[5211.48s -> 5228.92s]  Fucking green screen. God damn it. All right. Well if I rematch it's not
[5228.92s -> 5234.49s]  gonna randomize him again. I'm gonna have to just do another
[5234.49s -> 5241.14s]  one. The green screen winning is worse than the pencil.
[5241.14s -> 5246.79s]  I don't think that's true. All right. I'll do another one for fun.
[5246.79s -> 5250.97s]  We'll do the encore here. Congratulations to the 2018
[5250.97s -> 5258.31s]  Jermania Rumble for the green screen. At least it wasn't the quiet man.
[5258.31s -> 5265.06s]  Oh thank god. There's nothing. I would have been
[5265.06s -> 5276.92s]  so upset. All right. Let's just do another rumble.
[5276.92s -> 5281.45s]  So this next one is not canon but it's just for fun. I guess we can
[5281.45s -> 5289.59s]  throw. How about this? It's canon. No. The green
[5289.59s -> 5298.42s]  screen wins. It's out of my hands. I can't fucking
[5298.42s -> 5305.13s]  believe it. All right. Let me get this set up.
[5305.13s -> 5317.98s]  Let's put the same people in at random. Show the stats of everybody.
[5317.98s -> 5324.01s]  They're all very very similar. I'll show you. Hold on.
[5324.01s -> 5329.51s]  I don't think the green screen has that high of
[5329.51s -> 5333.27s]  stats. Yeah he doesn't. Lou has more stats than the green
[5333.27s -> 5335.35s]  screen. Like we'll just put it that way.
[5335.35s -> 5345.37s]  Like look. Lou is a hundred overall. Green screen is 92.
[5345.37s -> 5352.68s]  Like you know what I mean? He's a fucking hundred. But everybody.
[5352.76s -> 5360.49s]  I never put anybody under like 85. Like ever. Like 90. Because it's more fun
[5360.49s -> 5362.89s]  that way. Because if you have. It doesn't really
[5362.89s -> 5367.30s]  matter as much. Oh and it's 92. No they're all
[5367.30s -> 5375.45s]  like in the 80s and 90s. What does Sandler have?
[5380.28s -> 5385.46s]  Never mind. That's not true. He's 79.
[5385.46s -> 5391.43s]  All right.
[5394.46s -> 5405.91s]  All right. Let's get. Let's get everybody in here. See. Well binary man's 80.
[5405.91s -> 5410.15s]  Yeah everybody's within like 80 to 100. 80 to 95.
[5410.15s -> 5419.45s]  So then it's not like unfair for anybody. Fucking green screen.
[5419.45s -> 5423.77s]  Gary the fuck up's 100. Well you. Yeah I don't know why he's stronger
[5423.77s -> 5426.49s]  than Bill. He should not be stronger than Bill
[5426.49s -> 5437.88s]  crazy. But he is apparently. Yeah 94. Except for Sandler. Well
[5437.88s -> 5440.28s]  but you really want me to make Adam Sandler
[5440.36s -> 5445.22s]  the strongest person. All right hold on. Let me get rid of you.
[5445.22s -> 5452.54s]  Who's not in it? Wait I don't think. I don't think she was in it before.
[5452.54s -> 5460.57s]  Oh you can be in there this time. Binary man. Binary man was so bad.
[5460.57s -> 5466.07s]  Did you even get to see his face? Look at his face. He's got like.
[5466.07s -> 5472.25s]  You can only have eight numbers of letters on a character.
[5472.25s -> 5475.85s]  Green screens of weight and stats. Yeah but wouldn't that be the same
[5475.85s -> 5480.73s]  thing with um like the labo and the the labo is
[5480.73s -> 5486.41s]  the same stats. He I know for I am certain that he is like a super heavy
[5486.41s -> 5492.04s]  weight. Bugleberry. I made him like four or five
[5492.04s -> 5500.68s]  hundred pounds. Let's go here. But if you were just
[5500.68s -> 5503.72s]  joining us for the the festivities there thank you for
[5503.72s -> 5510.55s]  joining. There's a lot of people here. So thanks a lot. Thanks for sticking
[5510.55s -> 5519.48s]  around. Now we're gonna do the the encore.
[5519.48s -> 5530.87s]  Yeah but here they all are. Otto versus Jeremy.
[5530.87s -> 5535.94s]  You have to see how it says random. Like I can't. I don't. You can do it.
[5535.94s -> 5539.86s]  See entry order. I can do it. But that's not fun.
[5539.86s -> 5543.24s]  I'd rather let the cards lie however they lie you know.
[5543.24s -> 5555.67s]  Okay but look at these other wrestlers like
[5555.67s -> 5573.58s]  73. 70. Come on man. Poor blue man. Blue man's never gonna win.
[5573.58s -> 5579.48s]  Green screen first. But you can't. We can't do that.
[5579.48s -> 5583.48s]  I have to at least give the it's not random at that point.
[5583.48s -> 5593.54s]  All right we got red blend. Chris Jericho is not going to be in it.
[5593.54s -> 5604.62s]  Uh there's real faster. Sans. Yeah there was no bf. Do I deserve to
[5604.62s -> 5609.51s]  I didn't put myself in the rumble. I'm already there like three times. Do
[5609.51s -> 5620.81s]  I deserve to be there this time? All right I guess I deserve to be there
[5620.81s -> 5626.52s]  on the encore. It's not canon so it's fine.
[5626.52s -> 5632.55s]  Now these two these two aren't being in it Labo.
[5632.63s -> 5636.60s]  I don't know who the hell you are but you're not in it. Uh Jax.
[5636.60s -> 5640.34s]  I really thought he was gonna go far. Look at his stats. Come on.
[5640.34s -> 5649.78s]  Elvis is 88. Who eliminated Jax? Leave John Cena in.
[5649.78s -> 5661.42s]  All right John Cena can replace Elvis. Who the hell is John Cena?
[5661.42s -> 5665.26s]  That's so odd. Oh Chad Gable. Chris Jericho. Oh Kurt Hawkins.
[5665.26s -> 5670.71s]  Okay. DDP. Nice. Oh Dr Dan and Dr Don. You
[5670.71s -> 5687.94s]  belong in this universe. Where the hell is he? Seth Rollins.
[5687.94s -> 5696.28s]  Let's see. Where's John? Oh this is champions. Okay.
[5696.28s -> 5699.80s]  Jim. John Cena. Why the fuck am I putting him in this?
[5699.80s -> 5702.94s]  He's not even as strong as Jax. Why you don't even shouldn't even be here.
[5702.94s -> 5712.65s]  Adam Sandler stays. Be the very stays. All right uh poor wall dad.
[5712.65s -> 5723.61s]  How is pinwheel 96? Because it wouldn't have been fair.
[5723.61s -> 5727.37s]  If I made pinwheel like 10 and be 90
[5727.37s -> 5730.89s]  or 80 that match would you'd be able to say that's not fair.
[5730.89s -> 5737.50s]  I beat him as a fucking 90 plus. Uh Wally Wheat. Willem Dafoe.
[5737.50s -> 5744.10s]  Pinwheel. Okay. Yeah you're out of here.
[5744.10s -> 5747.94s]  Never allowed in another rumble ever again. All right so we put uh
[5747.94s -> 5755.26s]  Sweet Rhyne, Odd Michael, Magistank, or Fru Fru or Elvis.
[5755.26s -> 5759.46s]  Put pinwheel at 10. All right Sweet Rhyne.
[5759.46s -> 5762.42s]  So yeah the green screen's staying in. We can't just because they're all
[5762.42s -> 5769.98s]  powerful doesn't mean that they're impossible to overcome. All right
[5769.98s -> 5778.81s]  looks good. Uh yeah you can't do anything in a rumble.
[5778.81s -> 5782.33s]  Momentum is normal. Entrances are fine. Uh we could do
[5782.33s -> 5790.55s]  fast momentum. I usually put it on normal. Fast.
[5790.55s -> 5796.58s]  All right let's do it. All right let's go. Here's the encore rumble.
[5796.58s -> 5807.85s]  Let's see what happens. And then we'll do a um we'll do like a
[5807.85s -> 5811.05s]  hardcore like cage match or something with random people.
[5817.38s -> 5837.48s]  But that was a lot of fun. It always is. All right we already know how the rules
[5837.48s -> 5843.26s]  work. Skip. Can I skip? Oh yeah I forgot
[5843.26s -> 5846.38s]  John Cena is in the game. Well look I'm gonna get like another
[5846.38s -> 5850.89s]  drink. We'll we'll do another match or two.
[5850.89s -> 5854.97s]  Don't worry. All right I'll be right back. I'm gonna grab a drink.
[5854.97s -> 5857.69s]  Just let this play out. I don't even know. I'm not even gonna know who the
[5857.69s -> 5866.84s]  first two are so I'll be right back. Oh somebody said no Avril Lavigne. I
[5866.84s -> 5871.69s]  tried. The problem is you can't have uh
[5872.25s -> 5875.85s]  I'm pretty sure you can't have uh female and male wrestlers in the same ring at
[5875.85s -> 5881.29s]  the same time. I'm fairly certain about that.
[5881.29s -> 5885.48s]  Unless they changed it but I don't think they did because I couldn't do it.
[5885.48s -> 5889.40s]  So I tried. Avril Lavigne was supposed to be in place
[5889.40s -> 5894.95s]  of like one of the one of like the rain like the red blend like the
[5894.95s -> 5898.76s]  fucking wine. That was the last character by the
[5898.76s -> 5902.12s]  way. I just like I was oh shit I gotta have like a 36 person.
[5902.12s -> 5905.64s]  Oh come on. I don't want to see this. I'll be right back.
[5905.64s -> 6054.97s]  All right what I miss. Wait is this this entrance has been going off us so long?
[6056.33s -> 6060.10s]  This is all you've been seeing.
[6065.86s -> 6070.94s]  All right well here's the his alternate timeline.
[6070.94s -> 6075.59s]  Let's do it. Welcome to the encore rumble. B.F. Bilgerberri my favorite
[6075.59s -> 6078.71s]  character. Uh he's probably gonna get eliminated
[6078.71s -> 6085.70s]  in like 15 seconds. Here we go. And different camera angle for some
[6085.70s -> 6090.26s]  reason. That was nice. Can we get more cannon match?
[6090.26s -> 6093.22s]  No this is this is the alternate fucking timeline.
[6093.22s -> 6097.27s]  You know like civil war or marvel. How like
[6097.27s -> 6103.35s]  that did that happen in its own universe. Number three coming in is
[6103.35s -> 6111.16s]  Bill Krazy. Why do they wipe the dirt? I don't understand.
[6111.16s -> 6116.52s]  This is cannon. This is not cannon. It's not cannon because Bilgerberri
[6116.52s -> 6126.41s]  is gonna get eliminated first. And that just angers me. Bill Krazy
[6126.41s -> 6131.98s]  now has got pinwheel. Hopefully eliminating you first because
[6131.98s -> 6136.25s]  you're the worst character. So please get rid of pinwheel.
[6136.25s -> 6143.62s]  Get rid of him. Yes thank god. And are you sure you guys want this
[6143.62s -> 6146.10s]  cannon? Because beanbag sonic's coming in at number four. Are you sure you
[6146.10s -> 6149.62s]  want this to be cannon? You sure? Or do you want to write
[6149.62s -> 6153.30s]  your fan fiction where beanbag sonic wins and eliminates 29 people?
[6153.30s -> 6159.51s]  What the fuck? No no this is my favorite this is my favorite character.
[6159.51s -> 6164.81s]  Don't do it. Don't you fucking dare. Come on B.F.
[6164.81s -> 6170.50s]  Bugleberry. Pull a green screen. Yeah by the way I told you this already.
[6170.50s -> 6173.80s]  You'll be seeing this guy real fucking soon on Christmas.
[6173.80s -> 6180.02s]  Christmas spooktacular. Gonna be the scariest fucking Christmas scream you've
[6180.02s -> 6185.24s]  ever seen. Oh what a beautiful move by B.F.
[6185.24s -> 6189.50s]  Bugleberry. Quiet man coming in number five.
[6189.50s -> 6195.72s]  Thank god. Why would you roll to the outside of the ring? What are you
[6195.72s -> 6198.36s]  doing? Why would you ever do that? For what
[6198.36s -> 6202.44s]  reason? Bill Krazy is still taking punches
[6202.44s -> 6206.30s]  here for the quiet man. Going for his bird feet kick. The
[6206.30s -> 6209.66s]  claws there is gonna rip. I almost just set something really
[6209.66s -> 6212.46s]  fucked up. Let's just pretend let's just say we
[6212.46s -> 6217.74s]  kicked him. Dermaraptor coming in number six.
[6217.74s -> 6222.70s]  That guy back there is really excited in the white shirt.
[6222.70s -> 6228.30s]  Dermaraptor. Which by the way again next weekend is the movie night with
[6228.30s -> 6231.69s]  the green screen stuff. If you have a submission please go
[6231.69s -> 6234.65s]  check out the discord and check out the rules associated with
[6234.65s -> 6238.33s]  that. It's gonna be a lot of fun. I've already seen a couple submissions and
[6238.33s -> 6242.44s]  they are... What the fuck? That was crazy. This is
[6242.44s -> 6246.78s]  now canon. Just because of that. Like he's been
[6246.78s -> 6252.78s]  practicing for his YouTube channel. Here comes Garrett from the Sims
[6252.78s -> 6257.42s]  family house. I did that on the green screen. I did that
[6257.42s -> 6270.47s]  six days ago. That exact move. Nice reversal there by Garrett.
[6270.47s -> 6275.37s]  B.F. Bugleberry is still in. There goes the quiet man. Thank god.
[6275.37s -> 6278.09s]  If there was a straw poll right now he would be... Yeah there goes
[6278.09s -> 6283.26s]  Beanbag Sonic by B.F. Bugleberry. If I did a poll right now I think the
[6283.26s -> 6288.25s]  quiet man would be number one. Okay that...
[6288.25s -> 6291.93s]  What the hell was that? A lot of weird shit in this one. The
[6291.93s -> 6295.74s]  computer's trying to load a bunch of random things.
[6295.74s -> 6301.50s]  We get two Sims murder house. Nice recovery there by Chuck Schnozwell.
[6301.50s -> 6303.66s]  I mean they all hate each other so it makes sense of why they would be
[6303.66s -> 6309.13s]  fighting each other anyways. Belly to belly suplex. No he's
[6309.13s -> 6312.76s]  just kind of hugging him really tightly.
[6312.76s -> 6315.32s]  Not much you can do to build crazy that he has not done to himself
[6315.32s -> 6319.38s]  already. And Jerma Raptor's about to learn the hard way here. Well he's
[6319.38s -> 6322.86s]  gonna get scooped out and possibly thrown over by Bill Krazy.
[6322.86s -> 6326.38s]  Is it possible? Is he gonna get it done? B.F. Bugleberry now coming into
[6326.38s -> 6328.78s]  aid. Bill Krazy and they get it done.
[6328.78s -> 6334.86s]  Jerma Raptor is gone. Bugleberry showing lots of strength
[6334.86s -> 6338.38s]  here. He crossed arm. Check into Bill Krazy. After the
[6338.38s -> 6341.91s]  help I think it's time for me to fuck up your face.
[6341.91s -> 6349.03s]  Carvalet comes in. He's probably a little confused because this is the
[6349.03s -> 6354.36s]  second time that somebody has called in the last 30 minutes.
[6354.36s -> 6359.78s]  He keeps parking cars out there. By the way his entrance
[6359.78s -> 6363.69s]  is him riding it on a motorcycle and stopping. But you know you don't get to
[6363.69s -> 6368.79s]  see that because this is the rumble and it didn't make it. Number 10 is
[6368.79s -> 6374.57s]  Sands Undertale. He left after the last one. Yeah
[6374.57s -> 6376.46s]  we're just doing an encore one for fun.
[6376.46s -> 6380.38s]  That is now officially canon because Bill Krazy did a back flip so now
[6380.38s -> 6385.94s]  it's canon. Sands coming to number 10 and
[6385.94s -> 6389.78s]  probably instantly eliminated by Bill Krazy. Taunting is a bad move here.
[6389.78s -> 6396.54s]  Why would you do that? He did the Hulk Hogan and he kind of
[6396.54s -> 6404.04s]  looks like Hulk Hogan. I didn't intend that to happen but it just happened.
[6404.04s -> 6408.04s]  Otto the dog coming at number 11. Bugleberry looks like he's in...
[6408.04s -> 6416.90s]  No. Come on. Make this canon. Big suplex to Garrett from the Carvalet
[6416.90s -> 6421.69s]  from Sleeping Dogs. I thought that Bill Krazy was going
[6421.69s -> 6427.11s]  over the top ropes there but no. Big wow. Oh big wow. Otto is gone.
[6427.11s -> 6432.68s]  God damn it man. Can he catch a break? Bugleberry is top seat right
[6432.72s -> 6442.18s]  now. He didn't even get to take a second breath.
[6442.18s -> 6445.78s]  He inhaled, walked into the ring, got eliminated and then exhaled.
[6445.78s -> 6452.86s]  He didn't get to even breathe. Otto the dog is gone. Here comes Sweet Rind.
[6452.86s -> 6460.76s]  Still getting close to the halfway point on our
[6460.76s -> 6468.25s]  Marvel Ultimate alternate universe. Oh there goes the Carvalet Sweet Rind
[6468.25s -> 6471.61s]  with a big right head to punch. Throws him over. He's gone. Sorry if you
[6471.61s -> 6478.82s]  were betting on him. That was wild. Just swinging in
[6478.82s -> 6483.05s]  every direction was Bill Krazy. He didn't even care. He was just going
[6483.05s -> 6488.17s]  to hurt anybody that was near him. Powerbomb potentially over the top
[6488.17s -> 6490.81s]  ropes but to Sweet Rind from Bill Krazy. Are we going to see it?
[6490.81s -> 6495.38s]  Holy shit. That was dead happen twice. They both did it.
[6495.38s -> 6501.51s]  Bugleberry and Bill Krazy with the double.
[6501.51s -> 6509.19s]  In it comes John Cena. The chanting his name. Stop chanting his name.
[6509.19s -> 6514.04s]  Shut up everybody. Stop saying that. No. He's going to eliminate Chuck
[6514.04s -> 6518.95s]  Schnoswell. You happy about that? Is that what you guys want to see?
[6518.95s -> 6525.13s]  Don't say that. John Cena comes in. I forgot he was there. I thought there
[6525.13s -> 6529.02s]  was a mistake. I forgot I put him in here. Good.
[6529.02s -> 6533.40s]  The drop kick him over the top. Fireman coming in number 14.
[6533.40s -> 6537.96s]  B.F. Bugleberry has Bill Krazy now in a bad position. Fireman coming in
[6537.96s -> 6544.20s]  instead of 30 at 14. Yeah I want to see Fireman. I don't want to see
[6544.20s -> 6548.65s]  John Cena and now they both are working on Bill Krazy. There goes Bill
[6548.73s -> 6554.62s]  Krazy. He's out. Add him to the list of people eliminated by B.F.
[6554.62s -> 6558.25s]  Bugleberry. Right into the turnbuckle. Big
[6558.25s -> 6563.34s]  Fireman with an overhead throw. Throws over Chuck Schnoswell.
[6563.34s -> 6568.38s]  They're chanting some shit for John Cena.
[6568.38s -> 6573.08s]  Oh that's great. I'm so happy about this. Is he going to do a thing
[6573.08s -> 6574.52s]  where he puts a hand in front of his face
[6574.52s -> 6578.04s]  and like sneezes. Nice. The Hornet comes in with a big
[6578.04s -> 6584.20s]  right hand. Will the Hornet stay in for more than five seconds this time?
[6584.20s -> 6594.97s]  Maybe. Cena. John Cena. So here's the the question I have to ask you
[6594.97s -> 6600.33s]  guys. Is is it possible here that Fireman near
[6600.33s -> 6602.25s]  the Hornet. Can we get an up and smoke potential
[6602.25s -> 6607.50s]  scenario here? Glue Man coming in at 16. If you had one opportunity Glue Man
[6607.50s -> 6613.66s]  it's right now. Here's your shot. By the way I just
[6613.66s -> 6617.59s]  want to make this very clear. The Glue Man shirt will be back on sale
[6617.59s -> 6620.23s]  here. Oh.
[6620.71s -> 6625.03s]  Whoa. Not gonna waste any time. Get rid of Cena too.
[6625.03s -> 6629.16s]  Fire yourself up man. Come on. Get rid of Cena.
[6629.16s -> 6634.65s]  Bingo. That's a double elimination too from Glue Man. He's like fuck this man
[6634.65s -> 6637.05s]  if this is gonna be canon. I'm gonna make this shit canon.
[6637.05s -> 6645.19s]  I'm gonna win this shit. Red Blend wine coming in.
[6645.19s -> 6652.28s]  Will Glue Man and Bugleberry make this canon? I wonder. That was odd.
[6652.28s -> 6658.63s]  But nice work. Red Blend. Let me go ahead and.
[6658.63s -> 6665.83s]  Ah. Glue Man with a reversal to Red Blend. The best kind of wine you can
[6665.91s -> 6670.73s]  drink. It actually is. A lot of wines are gross. Red
[6670.73s -> 6676.17s]  Blend is the best of all red wines. Highly recommended. You're a
[6676.17s -> 6681.70s]  fucking weirdo. I know that's not even true. That's not true.
[6681.70s -> 6684.66s]  All right come on Bugleberry. Throw him over. Here comes the Greenscreen.
[6684.66s -> 6696.79s]  Greenscreen stuck on the ropes. No. Fuck you Greenscreen.
[6696.79s -> 6700.55s]  No. He ruined another one. He ruined another rumble.
[6700.55s -> 6704.28s]  He ruined another one. He's stuck on the ropes
[6704.28s -> 6715.18s]  and he can't even game crashed. He's like if I ain't winning I'm bringing
[6715.18s -> 6726.06s]  the whole fucking thing to the ground. I love and hate this. I fucking hate
[6726.06s -> 6728.38s]  this because we were in the middle of this. Like it was
[6728.38s -> 6733.35s]  we were doing something. Fuck the Greenscreen.
[6736.38s -> 6740.38s]  Now it has to be canon. All you guys that were so upset about this.
[6740.38s -> 6743.34s]  What what would you have me do about this? You understand?
[6743.34s -> 6747.02s]  What am I supposed to do about this? It's that he wins.
[6747.02s -> 6762.07s]  I'm sorry. Rewatch it. I can't even get out of here. I'm
[6762.07s -> 6786.68s]  stuck in here. My computer is hard locked. The
[6786.68s -> 6788.68s]  Greenscreen is about to turn the stream off.
[6788.68s -> 6795.18s]  You understand? That's unfucking believable.
[6795.18s -> 6802.81s]  Hold on. No. Oh wait wait wait. I got it. I got it.
[6802.81s -> 6808.31s]  No I don't. I have access to my mouse but I can't
[6808.31s -> 6815.78s]  force quit the game. Oh my god. I can't do anything. It's stuck here
[6815.78s -> 6819.10s]  forever. There's nothing I can do. I have to
[6823.94s -> 6827.30s]  control alt delete. I can't see the task manager because it's behind the
[6827.30s -> 6836.65s]  game. Hold on. Can I pull it up from here?
[6836.65s -> 6841.77s]  No I can't. Alt tap. Yeah alt tap doesn't do anything. Hold on wait wait.
[6841.77s -> 6850.81s]  Come on come on come on. No I can't do anything. It's fucked.
[6850.81s -> 6864.49s]  I am forced quitting the game right now and it's not doing anything.
[6864.49s -> 6872.22s]  Why? Of all things. I can't get out of it.
[6872.22s -> 6879.53s]  Start a new desktop. Put windows into a shutdown then
[6879.53s -> 6885.75s]  force the exe to stop. Yeah but then the computer turns off.
[6885.75s -> 6890.62s]  Now let me try this. Control Windows D. What does that do?
[6890.62s -> 6900.76s]  Hold on. No. Oh the whole thing's fucked.
[6900.76s -> 6905.21s]  Physically remove your hard drive from your computer. If I could just get the
[6905.21s -> 6908.17s]  task manager to like hold on. What if I do this?
[6908.17s -> 6911.45s]  I gotta make one of my other monitors the main display.
[6911.45s -> 6918.62s]  How the fuck can I even do that without seeing it?
[6918.62s -> 6924.10s]  Uh oh. Did I get it? Oh god what the fuck have I done?
[6925.38s -> 6936.09s]  Oh god what's happening? Oh boy this is not good.
[6936.09s -> 6941.46s]  Come on. Did I get it? Come on let me get it. Right here.
[6941.46s -> 6956.23s]  Get over here. Fuck. I can't do it. Why?
[6956.23s -> 6959.99s]  Well I'm gonna have to like turn off the screen.
[6959.99s -> 6969.72s]  I can't even see chat anymore. Force quitting it doesn't do anything.
[6969.72s -> 6978.55s]  Fucking green screen. God damn it. No I refuse to give up. What is this?
[6978.55s -> 6990.76s]  Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. This is bad. I'll be right. I'll be. Hold on. I'll be
[6990.76s -> 7031.93s]  right back. Hey. How are you doing?
[7031.93s -> 7040.14s]  Yeah I had to force boot my computer. That's canon. I'm not
[7040.14s -> 7042.38s]  changing it. There's no way. How can I change that now? We can do
[7042.38s -> 7053.05s]  another one? I mean at this point
[7053.05s -> 7059.99s]  that's the way it is. Let's do it. Let's do something different. Let's do
[7059.99s -> 7062.65s]  another one. Let's do like uh instead of a rumble.
[7062.65s -> 7068.65s]  The universe is making me not do one. So let's do uh
[7068.65s -> 7072.73s]  let's do like a hardcore cage match or something with
[7072.73s -> 7082.04s]  random characters. Hell in a cell. Let's do hell in a cell.
[7082.04s -> 7086.04s]  Green screen versus me in backstage rumble. I'm gonna lose. It's gonna crash
[7086.04s -> 7103.69s]  the game. All these fucking people. Jesus Christ.
[7103.69s -> 7106.97s]  All right. Are we talking about like alternate me or
[7106.97s -> 7116.36s]  or actual like old shitty me? Does anybody know what that picture is from?
[7117.05s -> 7127.99s]  Please tell me you do. Yeah that's from twitter.
[7130.68s -> 7137.46s]  All right let's do. See I'm 97. Yeah I do low blows. I'm an asshole. All
[7137.46s -> 7140.49s]  right. Let's see if I can take the green
[7140.49s -> 7144.66s]  screen down once and for all. See 90. Look everyone that was talking
[7144.66s -> 7148.10s]  shit about how the green screen is so powerful. You made the green screen to
[7148.10s -> 7155.75s]  see 92 versus 97. 92. He's not that good. There are
[7155.75s -> 7159.90s]  people that are like eight points higher than him. He's
[7159.90s -> 7165.42s]  too big. No he's not. Look at the labo. Labo. Okay
[7165.42s -> 7170.34s]  the labo is just as big just as heavy in 95.
[7170.34s -> 7174.42s]  And uh also by the way sweet rind is 92 and bigger.
[7174.42s -> 7184.14s]  He's bigger than the green screen. Hold on. How is the green screen
[7184.14s -> 7190.84s]  a super heavyweight? And nobody else? Do I have is he the only super heavyweight?
[7190.84s -> 7203.62s]  How? How does that make any sense? Why is he a super heavyweight?
[7203.70s -> 7207.91s]  There's another. There's another super heavyweight. All right I'm fucking kicking
[7207.91s -> 7213.24s]  this guy's ass. He has poison mist. It's green. I
[7213.24s -> 7218.33s]  figured maybe he was going to spit out green mist and it'd be funny.
[7218.33s -> 7221.05s]  All right let's go. Backstage brawl. I'm gonna kick the
[7221.05s -> 7226.07s]  fucking green screen's ass. Even as like old 33 year old shit
[7226.07s -> 7233.67s]  germa. The green screen has to be big. He's
[7233.67s -> 7245.40s]  huge. He's the size of a wall. Let's. Oh god. And here's the
[7245.40s -> 7248.92s]  worst part about this. This is very keyable. You could
[7248.92s -> 7252.04s]  you could put whatever you want there. So now I just fucked myself for like
[7252.04s -> 7260.42s]  another four years. Come on get up and fight him. Get up
[7260.42s -> 7265.26s]  and do anything. Do something. No don't let him beat you like
[7265.26s -> 7278.26s]  this. Somebody has to beat the green screen.
[7278.26s -> 7283.24s]  There it is. Oh he tripped. It's a little slippery over here.
[7283.24s -> 7285.94s]  All right let's go into the bathroom. I'm gonna like flush you down the
[7285.94s -> 7293.98s]  toilet. What? Oh no. No. We're going to the

[7305.34s -> 7308.81s]  shit in here. God this is gonna turn like Scooby

[7328.17s -> 7334.20s]  Who is this lady? What? Are we in somebody's office?
[7334.20s -> 7339.80s]  Oh no not the chair. Oh not the chair green screen. Come on.
[7339.80s -> 7348.65s]  This is nothing he's had enough already. Somebody said this is a porn intro.
[7348.65s -> 7352.65s]  Just key out the green screen. Can somebody please do that?
[7352.65s -> 7356.33s]  For the green screen stream next weekend. Key this fucking guy out of
[7356.33s -> 7360.57s]  here. What? No don't do it.
[7360.57s -> 7371.80s]  No. I'm still alive. I'm still alive.
[7371.80s -> 7378.18s]  I'm persevering. That's one thing I got guarantee for you.
[7378.18s -> 7381.30s]  It didn't break. I don't weigh enough for it to break.
[7381.30s -> 7396.20s]  I'm like 148 pounds. No put him through it. Pick him up germa. You can do it.
[7396.20s -> 7402.10s]  Do something. Punch him. Throw him. Throw him through the tv.
[7402.10s -> 7406.82s]  No don't. Not me. Oh my god. I tripped over the chair that was in the way.
[7406.82s -> 7412.73s]  Seriously. This is just sad. I'm just it's like
[7412.73s -> 7425.24s]  I'm just getting bullied right now. I feel bad about this whole thing.
[7425.24s -> 7432.15s]  Nobody can stop him. I lost. That's it. The game's over.
[7432.15s -> 7439.61s]  No it's not. Stay alive. Just fucking electrocute him.
[7439.61s -> 7442.57s]  Just like hitman style. Walk him into water and fucking throw
[7442.57s -> 7467.62s]  throw like a toaster at him. Come on. No. I got a better idea. I know who can
[7467.62s -> 7497.91s]  fucking stop this motherfucker. Now you're fucked. You're dead. I'm
[7497.91s -> 7500.71s]  channeling my Jecks. I beat Jebel first try guys.
[7500.71s -> 7510.01s]  I beat Jebel first try. You want me to first try this guy too?
[7510.01s -> 7516.84s]  Turn on the Jecks. A little bit taller. Yeah.
[7517.08s -> 7526.07s]  Push him. Come on. No. Come on. This is like the
[7526.07s -> 7530.95s]  this is my like ultimate character. You can't get embarrassed right now.
[7530.95s -> 7535.72s]  Oh my fucking lord. Don't get embarrassed.
[7535.72s -> 7546.50s]  Kick his ass. All the germas fail to the green screen.
[7546.50s -> 7550.04s]  No. That's not gonna happen. Jecks is gonna come back
[7550.04s -> 7561.06s]  and he's gonna hit him in the head with an iron.
[7561.06s -> 7567.88s]  He's a fucking hundred. You can't have better stats than Jecks.
[7567.88s -> 7571.08s]  Who's ironing? I'll open up a closet and find one.
[7571.08s -> 7575.10s]  I don't need to have an I'll find an iron. All right wipe the floor with
[7575.10s -> 7579.48s]  them Jecks. Come on. Why would you walk with them? You
[7579.48s -> 7588.90s]  can't toy with the green screen. End him. That's not it right? Okay
[7588.90s -> 7598.81s]  we're good. Come on. Come back here. Nice. Nice.
[7598.81s -> 7609.43s]  Very good. Very good. Why do I care this much about this?
[7609.43s -> 7617.05s]  I'm so upset with the green screen. Somebody has to beat him.
[7617.13s -> 7622.58s]  Where are you taking me? Where are we going now? Oh my god. I tripped over the
[7622.58s -> 7628.50s]  speed bump. Give me a break. That's not a Jecks move.
[7628.50s -> 7638.90s]  What the fuck? There are attendants? There's a truck?
[7638.90s -> 7642.76s]  Go to the car. Can we like run somebody over with the car? I will lose
[7642.76s -> 7646.79s]  my mind if that happens. If Jecks like gets in the car and
[7646.79s -> 7657.40s]  runs him over, I'll die on screen. You'll see me die on screen.
[7657.40s -> 7662.14s]  Come on. Twist the elbow. He's like no I can't take that.
[7662.14s -> 7665.32s]  There it is. There's the Jeremy Elbrittson family line.
[7665.32s -> 7668.82s]  I grab your wrist. I fall down. You fall down.
[7668.82s -> 7672.78s]  That's been for generations. My father taught me that. You want to fuck
[7672.78s -> 7675.26s]  somebody up in a fight? Just grab with two hands their
[7675.26s -> 7677.66s]  fucking wrist and fall down as hard as you can.
[7677.66s -> 7685.50s]  You're gonna fuck him up. Guaranteed. Break his neck.
[7685.50s -> 7689.96s]  Snap his neck. Come on Jecks. Snap his fucking neck.
[7689.96s -> 7704.86s]  Ugh. Come on. What? Give me a break. And watch out for the electricity.
[7704.86s -> 7718.58s]  No. No. Don't. Did I die? Is that? What? No. No.
[7718.58s -> 7731.13s]  No. No. Come on. There's no way. I got fucking electrocuted. The thing
[7731.13s -> 7737.53s]  that I said I wanted to do to him, he does to me. And I'm still alive.
[7737.53s -> 7749.64s]  You can't stop, Jecks. Even with electrocution.
[7749.64s -> 7753.34s]  Get over to the cars. I want to see a car death.
[7758.33s -> 7763.64s]  We need super Jecks. Should I make super Jecks?
[7763.64s -> 7770.36s]  Just make them like seven feet tall. Just turn them like green and make them
[7770.36s -> 7780.07s]  like fucking eight feet tall. Why is this turning into a DBZ timeline?
[7780.07s -> 7795.56s]  Oh I can't beat him as regular Jecks. I have to go super Jecks.
[7795.56s -> 7832.06s]  That's it. No. That's not it. What? No. Don't taunt. What are you doing?
[7832.06s -> 7834.57s]  What the fuck? Did we just watch?
[7851.14s -> 7855.67s]  Oh my fucking back hurts. I thought I won and he's...
[7859.93s -> 7869.26s]  It's time to bring in Adam Sandler. Fuck it. We're going with the real. The real. S-tier.
[7879.11s -> 7890.57s]  Fucking Adam Sandler. Where is he? Somebody. Come on. He's 79. He sucks.
[7897.34s -> 7903.00s]  Let's go. Come on, Sandler. If it doesn't work, we're gonna combine Jecks and Sandler.
[7903.64s -> 7909.35s]  We're gonna make super Adam Sandler Jecks. All right. Come on, Sandler.
[7909.35s -> 7913.78s]  It's always backstage. I wonder what's gonna happen. He's gonna push him and he's gonna punch
[7913.78s -> 7930.46s]  in the face. Why did I think this was gonna work? He's gonna break his neck.
[7945.83s -> 7949.61s]  He's gonna kill him. We just sent Adam Sandler to his death.
[7951.11s -> 7954.31s]  This wasn't even an attempt. He's 79 and he's a piece of shit.
[7955.11s -> 7961.64s]  Oh, I really thought he was gonna snap his neck right there. I was about to fucking lose my mind.
[7964.07s -> 7974.41s]  Electrocute. Sandler, electrocute. Sandler, use electrocute. No, don't get electrocuted.
[7974.41s -> 7984.46s]  Oh my god. Come on, fight back. Use the Metacritic score of your last six movies
[7985.10s -> 8004.31s]  to combine until like 72 percent. God damn it, man. I'm gonna die. Where are you taking him? This
[8004.31s -> 8010.68s]  is just bad. Take him into the car. Powerbomb Adam Sandler through the roof of the car
[8011.77s -> 8016.65s]  and I will piss my pants. People come out of my fucking penis. It just, that will happen.
[8018.52s -> 8024.41s]  Oh, what a reversal. Holy shit. That was an absolute, that was a beautiful reversal.
[8025.05s -> 8037.24s]  Oh, come on. Don't let that be the end. Is that the end? It always ends right here. Can
[8037.24s -> 8043.86s]  we not end in the fucking hallway? Uh, excuse me. Excuse me attendant. Fire extinguisher. Get it.
[8045.48s -> 8047.96s]  Sandler, if you're smart, you're gonna get that fire extinguisher and you're gonna throw it
[8047.96s -> 8057.96s]  in his face. Nice. Come on. He did it. Is that it? No, it's never it. He's like,
[8057.96s -> 8068.12s]  it's like Michael Myers, man. You can't taunt before. These really are like Microsoft
[8068.12s -> 8081.37s]  3D movie maker sound effects. Get out to the cars. At least finish it on the cars, guys.
[8082.31s -> 8096.14s]  Nice parry. No, don't take him back here. Uh, I'll tell you one thing. Green screen is slow
[8096.14s -> 8104.22s]  to get up. Now where are we going? All the way down this hallway. Wherever the hell this is,
[8104.22s -> 8111.26s]  he's doing the, I'm gonna end this taunt. Uh, that's it. He's gonna taunt. While he's
[8111.26s -> 8115.66s]  lying on the ground, you had an opportunity there. Nice job. This is a fucking idiot.
[8116.22s -> 8131.40s]  This is three matches in a row. He's tired. And now people are booing. I don't blame them.
[8131.40s -> 8142.22s]  I would be booing too. Come on, Sandler. Now is it over? What's going on with his legs?
[8143.67s -> 8150.54s]  He's prepping up like a finishing move. No, he does it every time and he wins with that
[8150.54s -> 8180.26s]  every time. What are you doing? Adam Sandler is fine. No, he's not. Break his leg. Get up.
[8180.90s -> 8190.84s]  Don't get choked out. Oh my God. Look, he's limp. Did you see that leg? Did you see how
[8190.84s -> 8197.59s]  fucked up that was? This is bad. Adam Sandler is limp right now. This is just fucking sad.
[8198.97s -> 8225.46s]  Sadler. And with that, a reversal. He's not gonna be Adam Sandler for all. Come on,
[8225.46s -> 8232.57s]  Sandler. He's got him in the chokeslip. This is his finishing move. Do it. Holy shit.
[8232.57s -> 8251.61s]  Did he win? He wins, right? Come on. At the Sandler chokeslip. Dude, no. I can't. This is
[8251.61s -> 8269.06s]  going on for a long time. I'm gonna fucking die. I need to stop. I need to like look away
[8269.06s -> 8310.73s]  from the screen. What did he do? Break his neck. Oh, what a fucking recovery. Oh my God.
[8312.73s -> 8322.60s]  I need to stop. I need to stop looking at the screen. This is fucking stupid.
[8332.14s -> 8347.30s]  All right, it's time. It's time to make super jacks. Fuck this guy. Are you kidding me?
[8368.17s -> 8373.78s]  It's time to overclock me. What? Why is it Willem Dafoe? I don't know. Okay. All right.
[8374.34s -> 8383.94s]  It's time to make fucking super jacks. Let's fucking power him up. You know what I mean?
[8383.94s -> 8401.50s]  Like feed him up. Like 640 pounds. Inject him. There you go. Right here. Fucking inject him.
[8404.87s -> 8414.17s]  It actually will be unfucking beatable. Thick ass neck too. You know what I mean? Right there.
[8421.34s -> 8428.82s]  So many muscles in the back that it's actually like it looks bad. Yep. An incredibly defined
[8428.82s -> 8436.79s]  chest. Washboard abs. Look at this shit. That looks gross because it's so good.
[8442.57s -> 8453.59s]  Fucking veins everywhere. We are meticulously making a creature, a person that will
[8453.59s -> 8462.20s]  absolutely never be beaten. Ever. Give him a nice ass too. No, no, no, no. It's gonna be like a
[8462.20s -> 8475.53s]  fatter one. What? What the fuck am I talking about? No. There we go. No, no, no, no. Where
[8475.53s -> 8484.26s]  were they? Where were they? The huge ones. The fucking Thanksgiving turkey legs. And we're gonna
[8484.26s -> 8490.89s]  make them glow. It's gonna be obnoxious how much he glows. Look at these. Nobody has legs
[8490.89s -> 8507.19s]  like this. And put oil all over his body so it's slippery and shit. Look at that. We're not even
[8507.19s -> 8558.41s]  done. Fucking RGB glasses. Look at those. Those are like a thousand dollars. Make them fucking
[8558.41s -> 8591.90s]  shine. Gold? No shirt. Okay fine. Fuck it. Material? Gold. Gold and shining. And he's
[8591.90s -> 8615.50s]  gonna be a hundred in every stat. 100. Gold hair too? Oh you better believe it. And he's
[8615.58s -> 8630.73s]  getting fucking DBZ hair. Yeah, fuck this material. If it ain't glowing and gold, I don't want it.
[8630.73s -> 8658.25s]  And that's maximum gold intensity. Look at that shit. He looks fucking absolutely fabulous.
[8658.25s -> 8681.99s]  All right. Now it's time for the hair. Macaroni pants? You thought I was kidding. We're
[8681.99s -> 8711.61s]  actually doing like the Super Saiyan hair. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Excuse me.
[8711.61s -> 8725.90s]  And, and he's getting an infinity gauntlet. This, I want to make sure he fucking wins
[8725.90s -> 8761.45s]  guaranteed. We can only have one stone. The power stone. That's the only fucking one that
[8761.45s -> 8775.99s]  matters anyways. Give him two infinity gauntlets. Okay. Was it the mind stone? What's the,
[8775.99s -> 8781.66s]  what's the other most expensive fucking thing in the world? Expensive. I mean,
[8781.66s -> 8790.25s]  you know what I'm saying. It's blue, right? Give him a sans eye. I can't give him a sans
[8790.25s -> 8800.04s]  eye. I can't make a sans eye. This, no, I don't have a, I can't make a sans eye.
[8802.49s -> 8856.01s]  Sans eye. Sans eye. Sans eye. Close enough. Wrong eye. Well he can have it in both eyes.
[8859.19s -> 8865.67s]  No, I can't do wrong. I can't change the eye. Do you understand? It's only that. That's it.
[8865.67s -> 8883.99s]  That's your sans eye. You can. What do you mean you can? How? It's only that one on the one
[8883.99s -> 8891.61s]  side. Sunglasses. Go back. Well, how would I, what, okay. I'll make them sans glasses.
[8891.61s -> 8920.58s]  Okay. There. That's fucking sans glasses. I think he's ready. Two infinity gauntlets,
[8920.58s -> 8924.84s]  two sans eyes. Super Saiyan. And he's fucking seven and a half feet tall.
[8924.84s -> 8946.89s]  Put Jax across. Okay. Jax across the chest. I'll write Jax across his chest. That's a good
[8946.89s -> 8964.30s]  idea. And fucking, like, blood. Now, you know what else he's gonna fucking have?
[8964.30s -> 9013.02s]  He's gonna channel fucking Beanbag Sonic. No, that, there's a reason why I didn't put him
[9013.02s -> 9086.63s]  in the game. You understand? Now I have it on my chest. That means it's fucking real.
[9086.63s -> 9095.78s]  Okay. Blood. All right. I need the glow. That's right. I need the glow. No, not Q.
[9095.78s -> 9133.67s]  Q Jax. What? Q Jax. Quadruple Jax. It's done. Now let's go to the most important part.
[9133.67s -> 9145.37s]  100 in every single step. Every single one. As high as I can get it. Minecraft logo. Well,
[9145.37s -> 9169.70s]  that's an incredibly powerful thing. The presentation name. V. Oh, from Boston.
[9169.70s -> 9181.62s]  Leg power. Grappling everything at 100. Every single thing. If there's not something at max,
[9181.62s -> 9196.06s]  then there's a problem. V for vengeance. Mic performance. What a stupid stat. He is 100.
[9196.62s -> 9205.83s]  Abilities. Give him fucking everything. Skills. He's already got like, they all have that
[9205.91s -> 9219.64s]  anyways. Okay, I'm ready. New screen pose. That's pretty good. With the two infinity gauntlets.
[9221.69s -> 9235.14s]  Level three. Level three. Level three. Hold on, wait. Let's get the pose. Level one. Level,
[9236.02s -> 9264.92s]  level three. Let's see it. All level three. You can't have everything level three.
[9264.92s -> 9277.32s]  Let's watch the absolute destruction of the green screen. All level three. Hold on. Where is
[9277.32s -> 9316.76s]  he? Oh, that's great. 100 everything. Okay, let's do this. Everything level three.
[9317.69s -> 9323.34s]  Literal god. And the payback is, look at this. Teleport behind your opponent. Uh, sure.
[9324.14s -> 9357.22s]  Instant recovery. The buff enhances your buff. Save it. Let's go. He's ready. All right,
[9357.22s -> 9361.70s]  now let's play, uh, what's that song from, uh, what's that song from fucking my hero
[9361.70s -> 9382.20s]  academia? I don't like watch anime. I've watched like one. I've only seen one anime.
[9382.20s -> 9412.42s]  One-on-one. Backstage brawl. Super Jex. Good fucking luck. 92. Give me a break. Okay.
[9429.38s -> 9449.29s]  Acid base. Good call. That's a good call. Let me get it ready. What am I gonna chat?
[9449.29s -> 9465.83s]  We're gonna get to see Super Jex fucking just absolutely dunk on somebody. So here we go.
[9468.71s -> 9489.05s]  Let me make sure it's fucking loud enough. Come on, Super Jex. This is what you were made for.
[9489.05s -> 9497.53s]  You were created for this one fucking moment. Super Jex versus green screen. Oh,
[9497.53s -> 9501.69s]  you think you're tall? You think you're like as tall as me? I don't think so.
[9501.69s -> 9532.07s]  You wanna talk shit? Let's go. Super Jex. Come on, Super. No fucking way.
[9532.87s -> 9565.70s]  Come on, turn up Super Jex. Turn the fuck up. What? Dude, are you really gonna let
[9565.70s -> 9572.33s]  Adam Sandler do a better job than you? Give me a fucking break. Powerbomb him through glass table.
[9573.05s -> 9587.59s]  You got two infinity gauntlets. Two infinity gauntlets. That's 640 pounds. He's immutable.
[9588.31s -> 9604.09s]  He's unbeatable. Come on, Super Jex. Where are you taking him? Oh my god. He's only
[9604.09s -> 9608.33s]  fighting at 20%. No, I mean very clearly he's lit the fuck up at like 120%.
[9608.33s -> 9616.42s]  20%. This is the comeback right here. What are you doing? What? You just missed like four times.
[9617.37s -> 9625.27s]  You can't. What are you doing? Wait, why is the meme funeral about to play autoplay?
[9633.78s -> 9644.17s]  Meme funeral. That's a fucking. Break his neck. Break his fucking neck. Snap it.
[9644.89s -> 9658.50s]  Come on, Super Jex. Yes.
[9676.81s -> 9693.42s]  Oh, shut up. No, I don't. We did it. Super Jex. Timeline has been restored.
[9696.22s -> 9699.50s]  Now I need to make a super green screen.
[9705.67s -> 9706.17s]  No.
[9713.35s -> 9717.27s]  And then we gotta put him in a fucking hell in a cell. Oh god damn it. Why?
[9731.91s -> 9737.59s]  Hold on, I gotta duplicate it and make him gold.
[9738.63s -> 9742.25s]  And then I gotta put him in a hell in a cell. The ultimate battle.
[9744.07s -> 9748.31s]  Look at how good that Willem Dafoe is. I'm sorry, that's fucking perfect.
[9749.11s -> 9767.98s]  What a perfect Willem Dafoe. He's as big as he can get. He's six. He already is there.
[9770.57s -> 9777.11s]  Make him a blue screen. Super gold screen. Well, no, he has to be a gold screen. Blue screen.
[9778.17s -> 9799.94s]  Oh god damn it. Sans blue screen. But forget about the Sans. Let's see. Gold.
[9800.66s -> 9816.41s]  He kind of has to be a gold screen. I mean, he just does. Blue or riot. Can he have a gold
[9816.41s -> 9836.46s]  head? Blue. Can he have like a gold face? This is going to be unbearable to look at.
[9837.10s -> 9846.33s]  This is going to be awful on the eyes. Gold X's. Okay, that makes sense.
[9846.97s -> 9858.81s]  Oh, that's gonna be a pain in the ass to put all those up. Jesus fucking christ.
[9859.69s -> 9877.70s]  It already, it already hurts my head. This is gonna take a long time.
[9879.16s -> 9882.60s]  If you guys are curious as to how long it makes to make a character, like just to make one.
[9884.06s -> 9893.91s]  I mean, you painstakingly go through and do this. That's not showing up well.
[9893.91s -> 9924.78s]  Maybe an orange will work. A dark orange with a gold look. It's just Dr. Manhattan.
[9924.78s -> 9932.55s]  That's what it's turning into. And then make Giga Sandler. We're going too deep, I think.
[9935.32s -> 9945.29s]  If I make the material different. Giga Sandler. I'll just make it darker blue.
[9946.01s -> 9963.38s]  That's the only way it's gonna work. That's okay. No, that's fine. It's glowing. In
[9963.38s -> 9968.02s]  every way the blue is a different looking blue, but because it's glowing. I wonder if
[9968.02s -> 9979.61s]  we can make it darker. Yes, we can. But I don't want to go to like purple though.
[9982.09s -> 9990.26s]  That looks good. That's the correct looking blue, I think. Remember, it is glowing. He looks like
[9990.26s -> 9995.93s]  a tube of toothpaste. I'm sorry. Well, it's fucking super green screen. You think I'm gonna
[9995.93s -> 10033.37s]  change his name? Super Sweet Rind. We're going too deep. That's too deep. That looks good.
[10033.37s -> 10046.94s]  I gotta fix the other one though. Giga Rind. You guys see how you can just get lost in
[10046.94s -> 10065.35s]  these games, right? What the fuck does that present even mean? What does that mean? What
[10065.35s -> 10077.67s]  does that even mean? I can't even, I don't know what that means. All right, that's fine. Wait,
[10077.67s -> 10092.97s]  is that the right color? Is that the right color? Now it is. There's so many X's on them.
[10092.97s -> 10128.87s]  I'm going as fast as I can. One, two, three, one, one, two, three, four, five. Thankfully,
[10128.87s -> 10133.96s]  it's already in place and I have to spend like an hour making this. It takes about
[10133.96s -> 10137.90s]  30 to, 30 minutes to an hour to make every character. Think about how easy they are.
[10137.90s -> 10146.14s]  So if you can imagine 36 characters, it was about 30 to 40 hours to make everything.
[10146.14s -> 10162.31s]  But I love it. I have so much fun just making weird shit. No, don't emboss it. I need to make
[10162.31s -> 10177.99s]  it glow, man. Material. There we go. Because even like this, this shit I'm doing right now,
[10177.99s -> 10184.34s]  you wouldn't imagine it would take long, but time just melts the fuck away. And this
[10184.34s -> 10197.32s]  shit is already here. And this guy is like a fairly simple person. Galoo Man God form.
[10199.91s -> 10202.79s]  Okay, that's all right. And then the one, the two in the back. Oh, he's got four in the
[10202.79s -> 10209.21s]  back, actually. Well, here's a little behind the scenes, how things work when you make
[10209.21s -> 10225.67s]  characters in these games. Fuck. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One,
[10225.67s -> 10241.53s]  two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Still angry that the game crashed when
[10241.53s -> 10246.14s]  he was doing, when Galoo Man was doing. I know. I don't know why that seems to happen
[10246.14s -> 10252.62s]  every time we do these. Blue screen of death, green screen. All right. Almost done.
[10253.34s -> 10267.16s]  Only two more. Thankfully, I'm familiar with the menus too, because I'd be like,
[10267.16s -> 10280.22s]  wait, where do I go? What, what, what, what does this do? Why is this headed there?
[10280.22s -> 10285.22s]  The head will be changed, don't worry. The head's gonna get changed. All right,
[10285.22s -> 10291.80s]  there's all the markers. Gold markers glowing. So now we're gonna go to the
[10291.80s -> 10301.34s]  head. Hands too, need to be changed. Edit them. That's fine. Make them glow.
[10301.90s -> 10318.90s]  And make them that blue. That matches pretty well. Good. Pretty good. Fucking
[10318.90s -> 10331.56s]  giga blue screen. That's it. Make his head the right color. He's already
[10331.56s -> 10339.78s]  glowing. That's good. Matches pretty well. I'm gonna change the material
[10339.78s -> 10342.34s]  though. No, I'm not. Because that would take the glow off. That's good.
[10346.52s -> 10356.42s]  He's so, he's so oily and shiny. All right, gonna do his feet. He's wearing
[10356.42s -> 10365.90s]  just green socks. That doesn't match. It's weird because sometimes you pick
[10365.90s -> 10371.32s]  the same color, but it just doesn't match. That's close enough, I think,
[10371.32s -> 10384.82s]  right here. Maybe a little bit darker. Oh, because it needs to be glowing,
[10384.82s -> 10396.79s]  right? All right, he's done. There's giga blue screen. I don't know.
[10397.99s -> 10402.42s]  There he is. Hair? I can't, I can't put hair on him.
[10404.86s -> 10413.02s]  Put Goku hair on him? I can't, I can't. I can't. Should I just take the mask off
[10413.02s -> 10420.82s]  and give him Goku hair? I can't. Hair can't go. Here's the most
[10420.82s -> 10427.54s]  infuriating thing about WWE since 2K14, okay? Here's a major complaint.
[10431.03s -> 10434.95s]  Half of the stuff for clothing and masks and face masks and head gear
[10435.59s -> 10437.91s]  is not compatible with half of the other stuff in the game.
[10438.63s -> 10442.71s]  So, for instance, look at this. Ready? Like, appearance, right? Even clothing.
[10442.71s -> 10445.27s]  Let me go to, like, upper body, for instance. And, like, oh, jackets.
[10445.99s -> 10449.35s]  So, like, there are a bunch of shit. Like, I can't put any of these on.
[10450.68s -> 10453.72s]  None of these can go on. See that in the lower left corner?
[10455.03s -> 10457.43s]  That means it can only be put on during an entrance.
[10458.07s -> 10462.25s]  Look at, let's, like, half the fucking list is unusable.
[10463.56s -> 10465.88s]  And then you run into the problem of, you see the ones with the,
[10465.88s -> 10470.52s]  these on the Xs here? See the lower left? I literally have to take off my mask to put
[10470.52s -> 10477.00s]  this jacket on. Oh, you want to put this shirt on? No, no, no, no. You have to take off the mask.
[10478.52s -> 10482.28s]  I don't, I don't understand why. More than half the options are not usable together.
[10485.03s -> 10490.52s]  And that's been happening since 2K14. It seems like 2K, whatever,
[10490.52s -> 10495.96s]  Yuke's and Visual Concepts, they're so concerned. They are so fucking concerned
[10495.96s -> 10500.62s]  about clipping that they make it so you can't customize the character.
[10500.62s -> 10504.86s]  Like, they're so scared that if I put this on, it's going to clip through the mask.
[10504.86s -> 10511.75s]  Who gives a shit? It limits so many of the, like, I'm like, oh, this is a cool,
[10511.75s -> 10514.47s]  look at this jacket, the puffy blue jacket, this exact thing.
[10514.47s -> 10517.59s]  Nope, can't use it, sorry. Move on. I can use this one, though.
[10518.39s -> 10522.63s]  It's the same reason why you can't put on, like, look at this.
[10523.43s -> 10527.66s]  Like, see, like, uh, like, torso accessories or something.
[10527.66s -> 10531.56s]  See, look, like, why can't I put this on? I can't put this on.
[10532.12s -> 10537.78s]  But I can put these on. Why? Is this, what?
[10537.78s -> 10541.62s]  I could put a fucking rubber ducky on for an entrance, but I can't put on a scarf.
[10542.34s -> 10547.98s]  I have to take off the mask. Put it on.
[10555.19s -> 10567.16s]  You see? See how dumb this is? Go back, go back.
[10567.16s -> 10571.08s]  Well, I, see, now, now, if I make that mistake, I have to put everything back on.
[10573.42s -> 10574.62s]  See? I have to go all the way back.
[10576.65s -> 10580.01s]  Neck accessories. What do we got for neck accessories in WWE?
[10580.01s -> 10583.45s]  Oh, oh, I can put headphones. No, you can't, no, you can't do that.
[10584.09s -> 10586.01s]  Oh, what about, no, sorry, you can't do that either.
[10586.01s -> 10591.83s]  Oh, um, oh, and all of these I can't use unless I'm on an entrance.
[10591.83s -> 10593.27s]  I can't, no, I can't put that on.
[10596.79s -> 10599.67s]  Visual concepts and yukes. If you're watching this right now,
[10599.67s -> 10602.47s]  nobody gives a shit if it's going to clip through the fucking back of the mask.
[10603.03s -> 10605.27s]  Nobody cares. Put it back.
[10605.27s -> 10607.51s]  Let us fucking put the shit on that we want to put on.
[10607.51s -> 10608.62s]  For the love of God.
[10612.10s -> 10615.70s]  Like, nobody gives a shit if this is going to, like, clip through my head or if this,
[10615.70s -> 10617.70s]  like, I can only put this on an entrance.
[10617.70s -> 10621.16s]  No, I don't care. I can't just have this on in the match. Why?
[10624.95s -> 10626.07s]  It just doesn't make any sense.
[10628.36s -> 10631.56s]  But anyways, use the neck feathers.
[10644.60s -> 10648.68s]  Like, why can I use this but not, like, the headphones?
[10648.68s -> 10650.60s]  It doesn't make any sense.
[10650.60s -> 10663.61s]  Golden duck? You're not even going to get to see it.
[10664.17s -> 10666.97s]  The duck is only, I can't even put it on.
[10666.97s -> 10669.98s]  Oh, sorry, you can't use this.
[10669.98s -> 10674.06s]  Let's limit 45% of every item in the whole game.
[10674.62s -> 10679.53s]  You know, I do consulting work.
[10679.53s -> 10681.80s]  2K. I do consulting work.
[10683.70s -> 10684.58s]  Need a consultant.
[10690.89s -> 10692.33s]  Gold neck. All right.
[10692.33s -> 10697.69s]  Still glowing. That's fine.
[10697.69s -> 10705.00s]  Well, if we're going that far, we might as well do this.
[10775.86s -> 10779.88s]  Sands. I don't even care about sands.
[10779.88s -> 10780.92s]  Stop this right now.
[10782.23s -> 10782.95s]  What am I doing?
[10786.20s -> 10787.48s]  I'm just, like, adding.
[10787.48s -> 10810.18s]  I'm adding and adding and adding and adding.
[10810.18s -> 10811.22s]  No, I don't like these.
[10811.22s -> 10820.74s]  I don't like them. Get rid of them.
[10820.74s -> 10821.46s]  All right. Stats.
[10829.69s -> 10831.85s]  It's like a fucking cartoon character.
[10831.85s -> 10837.05s]  Put his name on his chest.
[10837.05s -> 10838.65s]  Super green screen, right?
[10838.65s -> 10885.75s]  There you go.
[10885.75s -> 10886.55s]  Take it off.
[10886.55s -> 10887.91s]  No, it's a blue screen of death.
[10900.30s -> 10900.70s]  Ruined.
[10903.82s -> 10905.42s]  What? What do you mean ruined?
[10905.42s -> 10912.22s]  It's nasty. Remove it.
[10912.94s -> 10913.98s]  I'm going to keep it.
[10913.98s -> 10922.68s]  Disgusting.
[10922.68s -> 10923.96s]  No, it's staying there.
[10923.96s -> 10929.96s]  Give him a gold thong.
[10929.96s -> 10933.06s]  I mean, I kind of have to.
[10933.06s -> 10934.02s]  And I can't.
[10934.02s -> 10935.06s]  I can't do that.
[10935.06s -> 10936.71s]  Would you like me to do that?
[10936.71s -> 10938.79s]  Oh, look at all these options.
[10938.79s -> 10939.67s]  Look at all. Wow.
[10939.67s -> 10940.87s]  Look at these options.
[10940.87s -> 10943.14s]  Oh, wow.
[10943.14s -> 10947.40s]  Oh, I sure wish I could put them on.
[10947.40s -> 10949.64s]  No, look at the hundreds of fucking options.
[10949.64s -> 10950.36s]  No, no, no, no.
[10950.36s -> 10951.08s]  I can't. Sorry.
[10951.08s -> 10951.88s]  You can't do that.
[10951.88s -> 10953.08s]  Sorry. He gets underneath.
[10953.08s -> 10954.04s]  You can't put it over.
[10954.04s -> 10954.76s]  I'm sorry.
[10955.32s -> 10956.28s]  Sorry, sir.
[10956.28s -> 10958.04s]  Did you want to create a custom character?
[10958.04s -> 10967.35s]  No. Get a JPG of a thong.
[10967.35s -> 10996.42s]  Give me a second.
[10996.42s -> 11025.72s]  Uploading it now.
[11025.72s -> 11028.68s]  I'm not fucking around.
[11028.68s -> 11038.82s]  Are you still?
[11038.82s -> 11040.66s]  Okay. Uploading now.
[11040.66s -> 11042.50s]  It's a thong.
[11044.81s -> 11048.04s]  It's done. Done.
[11048.04s -> 11051.02s]  Done. Let's go get it.
[11051.02s -> 11067.24s]  Hold on.
[11067.24s -> 11068.68s]  Upload an actual blue screen.
[11069.80s -> 11070.28s]  Hold on.
[11070.28s -> 11071.32s]  Wait, let me just save.
[11072.12s -> 11072.92s]  Super fucking.
[11072.92s -> 11074.52s]  No, I got to change his name.
[11075.32s -> 11090.36s]  Stats.
[11090.36s -> 11091.88s]  No, no, I'll do the stats.
[11091.88s -> 11092.84s]  Just wait a second.
[11092.84s -> 11099.66s]  I got to go download this image.
[11099.66s -> 11101.74s]  I'm putting a fucking gold thong on him.
[11101.74s -> 11110.25s]  Why the thong?
[11110.25s -> 11116.82s]  Somebody told me to do it.
[11116.82s -> 11119.18s]  If you're new to the stream,
[11119.18s -> 11119.82s]  just listen.
[11119.82s -> 11121.18s]  This is important.
[11121.18s -> 11121.98s]  If you're a new viewer
[11121.98s -> 11122.78s]  or if you're an old viewer,
[11122.78s -> 11123.26s]  you're not sure.
[11124.74s -> 11126.82s]  If one person, one guy,
[11126.82s -> 11128.18s]  one person said to do that,
[11129.30s -> 11133.02s]  okay, you will eventually be the one guy
[11133.90s -> 11136.06s]  that I take the request.
[11136.06s -> 11137.34s]  You'll be the one guy at some point.
[11137.98s -> 11139.35s]  You can't give shit to the one guy
[11139.35s -> 11140.31s]  when you'll be the one guy
[11140.31s -> 11141.03s]  at some point soon.
[11143.74s -> 11145.34s]  Let me download my community fucking thing.
[11146.30s -> 11152.54s]  It's not even, it's pink.
[11159.93s -> 11160.97s]  Well, that kind of fucks
[11160.97s -> 11167.46s]  that whole thing up, doesn't it?
[11167.46s -> 11168.82s]  Super blue screen of death.
[11169.38s -> 11172.25s]  I can't even change the color.
[11172.81s -> 11173.77s]  That person's right.
[11173.77s -> 11174.73s]  That one guy's right.
[11178.18s -> 11179.70s]  I'm not making super Willow.
[11179.70s -> 11181.22s]  No, hold on.
[11181.22s -> 11181.70s]  Just wait.
[11203.08s -> 11204.60s]  It's only the front.
[11205.40s -> 11206.20s]  It's only the front.
[11206.20s -> 11207.16s]  Just hold on.
[11212.86s -> 11213.50s]  I can't even.
[11213.50s -> 11214.14s]  Yes, I can.
[11214.14s -> 11215.50s]  I can change the color.
[11215.50s -> 11216.06s]  No, I can't.
[11244.22s -> 11248.14s]  Oh my god.
[11248.14s -> 11249.42s]  At least I can make it match.
[11250.06s -> 11266.62s]  It's like riding up his ass so bad.
[11275.59s -> 11276.87s]  What the fuck did this achieve?
[11279.80s -> 11280.84s]  This didn't achieve anything.
[11280.84s -> 11281.40s]  I don't, I don't.
[11365.67s -> 11366.47s]  No, what am I doing?
[11366.47s -> 11367.99s]  I'm thinking like an arrow.
[11367.99s -> 11368.87s]  Get this out of here.
[11368.87s -> 11369.91s]  Delete this.
[11369.91s -> 11371.35s]  What am I, what are you doing?
[11371.35s -> 11372.23s]  No, no, no, no.
[11372.23s -> 11372.73s]  Get out.
[11374.38s -> 11376.47s]  Okay, we're fine.
[11376.47s -> 11377.11s]  Oh, fuck.
[11377.11s -> 11377.83s]  Juicy's gone.
[11377.83s -> 11401.61s]  What the fuck was I doing?
[11401.61s -> 11403.37s]  Arrow to like my crotch.
[11403.37s -> 11416.57s]  All right, we're good.
[11423.43s -> 11426.60s]  It just went off the rails real quick.
[11426.60s -> 11427.48s]  Really quickly.
[11427.48s -> 11431.24s]  All right.
[11431.24s -> 11432.36s]  Now I can do the stats.
[11432.36s -> 11433.64s]  I gotta make sure the stats are 100.
[11436.65s -> 11437.69s]  Remember the fight?
[11439.51s -> 11440.55s]  Yeah, I do.
[11440.55s -> 11456.98s]  So many fucking people.
[11456.98s -> 11457.46s]  Where are you?
[11465.88s -> 11466.44s]  Okay.
[11466.44s -> 11469.80s]  Super PSOD from Las Vegas.
[11469.80s -> 11471.29s]  It's true.
[11471.29s -> 11472.63s]  All right, let's go.
[11472.63s -> 11481.59s]  Wasn't this supposed to only be like a two to three hour stream?
[11481.59s -> 11483.27s]  Yeah, this is the encore.
[11483.27s -> 11487.21s]  I mean, the event already happened.
[11487.21s -> 11488.89s]  The green screen won twice.
[11491.80s -> 11494.20s]  So we're just kind of having fun sticking around now.
[11505.10s -> 11505.42s]  All right.
[11506.06s -> 11507.10s]  Actually 100.
[11507.74s -> 11508.94s]  All level three skills.
[11509.90s -> 11524.26s]  And here is the final match of this particular circuit.
[11524.26s -> 11527.88s]  We spent so much time on these two idiots.
[11528.60s -> 11532.23s]  Menu pose.
[11532.95s -> 11540.46s]  Pretty good.
[11541.02s -> 11542.71s]  Done.
[11547.67s -> 11549.11s]  He's doing a Jojo pose.
[11549.11s -> 11549.75s]  No, he's not.
[11550.39s -> 11552.04s]  Thank you for the thong.
[11552.04s -> 11552.84s]  You're welcome.
[11552.84s -> 11555.32s]  One guy out of 7,000 people.
[11556.04s -> 11558.84s]  What have I done to him?
[11558.84s -> 11561.40s]  I made him that much more powerful.
[11562.04s -> 11565.14s]  All right, let's go.
[11565.86s -> 11568.31s]  While this loads, I'm going to go grab another drink.
[11568.95s -> 11570.07s]  Because why not, right?
[11571.03s -> 11573.80s]  One on one, Hell in a Cell.
[11581.08s -> 11583.80s]  Super Jax versus super blue screen of death.
[11584.52s -> 11589.14s]  There are no rules in Hell in a Cell.
[11596.66s -> 11596.98s]  All right.
[11598.26s -> 11599.54s]  For the entrances, here they come.
[11599.54s -> 11600.42s]  I'm going to grab a drink.
[11601.06s -> 11603.08s]  I'm not sure these two even have entrances.
[11603.64s -> 11605.66s]  I'll be right back.
[11605.66s -> 11607.11s]  See you in a second.
[11607.11s -> 11607.91s]  Watch the intros.
[11608.55s -> 11614.42s]  I can't, why can I not turn my stream?
[11614.42s -> 11617.85s]  It doesn't want to, hold on.
[11617.85s -> 11619.93s]  It really, it's going to be so much brighter than this.
[11620.57s -> 11622.82s]  Because that's not even a rendered light source.
[11629.58s -> 11630.38s]  I still can't do it.
[11630.94s -> 11632.95s]  What the fuck not?
[11632.95s -> 11635.03s]  Apparently I can't mute my microphone, so whatever.
[11635.03s -> 11635.83s]  We're in Illinois.
[11635.83s -> 11636.39s]  See you in a second.
[11637.03s -> 11639.53s]  It's going to be the same two entrances back to back,
[11639.53s -> 11640.41s]  because I never gave them that.
[11789.69s -> 11790.81s]  It started.
[11790.81s -> 11792.25s]  It started already, what?
[11793.37s -> 11794.57s]  Oh my god, what did I miss?
[11795.45s -> 11796.17s]  What did I miss?
[11801.77s -> 11803.53s]  Nothing, it just, okay, just started, good.
[11804.09s -> 11806.10s]  So if you don't know the Hell in a Cell rules,
[11808.02s -> 11810.26s]  the only way you can win is by pinning.
[11810.26s -> 11811.62s]  You just have to pin the guy.
[11811.62s -> 11812.12s]  That's it.
[11813.38s -> 11816.26s]  But, but, super juicy, by the way.
[11818.17s -> 11819.77s]  We've got the two strongest competitors
[11819.77s -> 11821.93s]  that have ever been in a German Rumble, ever.
[11822.49s -> 11828.38s]  We've got the super blue screen of death and super Jax.
[11831.06s -> 11833.78s]  Mere mortals are in attendance right now.
[11834.34s -> 11836.46s]  What about Zaraxos?
[11837.18s -> 11840.38s]  Well Zaraxos is the most powerful in the underworld.
[11840.38s -> 11841.42s]  We're talking about on Earth.
[11844.54s -> 11846.78s]  I wonder if, I'm going to go for a pin here,
[11846.78s -> 11848.30s]  super Jax on blue screen of death.
[11849.02s -> 11850.84s]  No, not even a one count.
[11850.84s -> 11852.68s]  This is going to be like a four hour long match.
[11853.32s -> 11858.70s]  We're just watching gods fight each other.
[11862.41s -> 11863.37s]  That fucking thong.
[11864.17s -> 11867.88s]  Zaraxos is not even in their league.
[11867.88s -> 11868.76s]  He's a commoner.
[11869.88s -> 11873.08s]  I, I mean, he doesn't glow, so there's that.
[11873.80s -> 11877.45s]  I wonder if we're going to see any,
[11877.45s -> 11878.89s]  all right, now we're going to the outside here.
[11879.53s -> 11882.52s]  Are we going to get to see some Hell in a Cell mayhem?
[11886.28s -> 11888.52s]  They're locked in here until somebody wins.
[11889.40s -> 11891.32s]  Reversal there by super blue screen of death.
[11892.41s -> 11897.30s]  Onto the corner, falls over the steps.
[11898.18s -> 11899.14s]  Play music.
[11901.50s -> 11901.98s]  Hold on.
[11905.19s -> 11910.55s]  Oh, you can, ah, this is a spoiler right here.
[11910.55s -> 11911.91s]  You can like see their stats.
[11916.33s -> 11917.21s]  Fighting music.
[11920.41s -> 11922.73s]  This is, this is called best fight music.
[11922.73s -> 11930.92s]  So here's best fight music.
[11930.92s -> 11934.04s]  Oh, people are going to hate this.
[11955.66s -> 11957.66s]  Let's get the stream copyright striked.
[11957.66s -> 11958.70s]  What do you say?
[11958.70s -> 11964.44s]  Oh, what a reversal by blue screen of death.
[11968.02s -> 11969.06s]  No, that better not be it.
[11970.34s -> 11978.90s]  One, two of Jax is bleeding from the face.
[11979.70s -> 11983.82s]  The signature choke move from blue screen of death.
[11984.62s -> 11987.10s]  They've both evolved since the beginning of this stream.
[11991.03s -> 11992.79s]  Can super Jax make it a two for two?
[12005.98s -> 12007.18s]  That's the fucking move.
[12007.18s -> 12008.54s]  Pass down the Elberton line.
[12009.42s -> 12014.65s]  Nobody can stop super Jax.
[12015.53s -> 12016.89s]  Not even God himself.
[12017.69s -> 12020.92s]  Here it comes.
[12021.88s -> 12022.44s]  Here it comes.
[12023.32s -> 12033.22s]  The diaper on the top rope.
[12033.78s -> 12035.06s]  This is live by the way.
[12035.06s -> 12035.94s]  Look at the top right corner.
[12035.94s -> 12036.82s]  It's live.
[12037.62s -> 12038.50s]  Hurricane Rana.
[12039.22s -> 12039.70s]  No, no.
[12039.70s -> 12047.46s]  Reversal and a spear.
[12048.26s -> 12049.06s]  Can he get the pin?
[12049.70s -> 12051.14s]  What a pathetic way to end.
[12052.10s -> 12057.38s]  Does Jax have it in him?
[12057.38s -> 12059.62s]  Can Jax possibly recover here?
[12059.62s -> 12060.74s]  I don't think it's possible.
[12063.16s -> 12063.72s]  Reversal.
[12064.36s -> 12072.41s]  Oh, there's nothing that can be done.
[12072.41s -> 12073.45s]  Jax is going to lose.
[12074.25s -> 12080.87s]  He's going to the top rope to crash the computer.
[12082.17s -> 12082.73s]  Wait a minute.
[12083.53s -> 12084.84s]  Wait a minute.
[12087.14s -> 12087.54s]  Can he?
[12088.44s -> 12089.72s]  No, he can't.
[12093.86s -> 12094.66s]  No, he can't.
[12095.54s -> 12096.02s]  He can't.
[12096.66s -> 12097.70s]  He can't.
[12097.70s -> 12098.74s]  But wait, he dodged it.
[12099.86s -> 12100.98s]  No, they both suck.
[12102.02s -> 12102.98s]  Gods among men.
[12109.02s -> 12110.54s]  Out to the outside again.
[12117.16s -> 12118.44s]  Do a spirit bomb.
[12118.44s -> 12119.08s]  Do anything.
[12120.60s -> 12123.64s]  Climb on top of the cage and fucking kill somebody.
[12126.04s -> 12128.04s]  Power bomb him from the top of the cage and kill him.
[12133.88s -> 12134.52s]  Backwards.
[12135.40s -> 12136.28s]  Oh, there it is.
[12138.44s -> 12139.64s]  The backwards move.
[12139.64s -> 12140.52s]  Is that going to be enough?
[12141.32s -> 12141.82s]  One.
[12142.52s -> 12143.02s]  Two.
[12143.16s -> 12143.66s]  No.
[12205.29s -> 12205.79s]  Let's go.
[12206.41s -> 12213.94s]  That's a power bomb pin.
[12215.32s -> 12215.82s]  Two.
[12216.12s -> 12216.52s]  Three.
[12216.52s -> 12217.24s]  No, that's not it.
[12217.24s -> 12217.80s]  That's not it.
[12218.60s -> 12220.39s]  Wait, what is he?
[12220.39s -> 12220.89s]  What?
[12222.14s -> 12222.94s]  Nice recovery.
[12222.94s -> 12223.74s]  He's running away.
[12225.26s -> 12226.38s]  What are you doing?
[12227.42s -> 12227.92s]  Check him.
[12236.31s -> 12237.27s]  What is happening?
[12241.58s -> 12242.14s]  So loud.
[12242.94s -> 12244.22s]  So he just pinned him again?
[12244.78s -> 12245.28s]  One.
[12245.74s -> 12246.24s]  Two.
[12247.10s -> 12251.74s]  He didn't get.
[12253.77s -> 12254.65s]  That's too much for me.
[12287.86s -> 12288.36s]  Crash it.
[12291.05s -> 12291.85s]  Oh, two.
[12294.31s -> 12296.23s]  And a backspinning soccer ball kick.
[12300.01s -> 12302.01s]  Can he go all the way here?
[12302.89s -> 12307.35s]  All he needed was the default YouTuber elevator music.
[12308.23s -> 12309.19s]  Was that going to be enough?
[12310.52s -> 12311.02s]  One.
[12311.64s -> 12312.14s]  Two.
[12312.92s -> 12313.42s]  Three.
[12313.42s -> 12314.04s]  He just did it.
[12314.04s -> 12314.54s]  He did.
[12315.08s -> 12315.80s]  That was lame.
[12316.52s -> 12317.02s]  That's...
[12317.64s -> 12322.52s]  They didn't even go on the top of the cell.
[12323.24s -> 12326.42s]  That was fucking stupid.
[12327.06s -> 12328.10s]  I don't even want to see this.
[12347.14s -> 12350.20s]  Ape man.
[12350.20s -> 12351.88s]  Ape man fucking ladder match.
[12352.60s -> 12353.10s]  No.
[12353.85s -> 12355.37s]  Ape man battle royale.
[12355.37s -> 12362.46s]  Ape man ladder?
[12362.46s -> 12363.26s]  That's not going to work.
[12365.18s -> 12366.14s]  Ladder tag?
[12366.14s -> 12366.86s]  Four-way?
[12366.86s -> 12367.58s]  Ladder...
[12367.58s -> 12368.38s]  Four-way tag?
[12368.94s -> 12373.82s]  What is it I tell him?
[12373.82s -> 12375.02s]  Turn entrances off.
[12376.44s -> 12377.32s]  Battle royale.
[12377.32s -> 12378.20s]  Can I change the rules?
[12378.92s -> 12386.33s]  Oh, let me see here.
[12388.72s -> 12389.52s]  Ladder.
[12389.52s -> 12390.80s]  What if I don't do ape man?
[12391.36s -> 12397.58s]  It's a rumble.
[12397.58s -> 12398.38s]  How do I...
[12398.38s -> 12399.42s]  Really rumble tournament.
[12400.14s -> 12402.65s]  Let me see here.
[12402.65s -> 12405.05s]  Extreme iron man last man's mission custom match.
[12405.85s -> 12408.25s]  Oh, fuck it.
[12408.25s -> 12411.13s]  Let's put like the shittiest characters in an ape man fucking ladder match.
[12411.13s -> 12411.85s]  Who gives a shit?
[12412.57s -> 12413.85s]  This is gonna be impossible.
[12415.44s -> 12417.04s]  Who are the worst characters in the whole thing?
[12417.92s -> 12418.48s]  Dr. Donna?
[12418.48s -> 12418.96s]  Dr. Dan?
[12422.48s -> 12423.92s]  And put super jacks in it.
[12426.11s -> 12426.43s]  All right.
[12426.43s -> 12427.15s]  Adam Sandler.
[12428.59s -> 12442.52s]  Adam Sandler sands the hornet 95.
[12446.54s -> 12447.10s]  Hold on you.
[12447.66s -> 12449.76s]  I can let Otto out here in a second.
[12450.48s -> 12452.40s]  No, I've refused to put quiet man in here.
[12452.40s -> 12452.90s]  He sucks.
[12454.06s -> 12455.34s]  Let's put fireman's...
[12455.34s -> 12457.82s]  I just want to put fireman in a match because I believe he's in 99.
[12457.82s -> 12458.62s]  I believe he deserves it.
[12466.30s -> 12466.94s]  The hornet's...
[12468.76s -> 12469.00s]  What?
[12469.00s -> 12469.80s]  Oh, he's already there.
[12472.57s -> 12473.69s]  No, pinwheel sucks.
[12475.77s -> 12477.13s]  Super blue screen of death.
[12477.69s -> 12481.76s]  Come on, let's go.
[12484.89s -> 12506.56s]  And this will probably be the last one of the night.
[12507.20s -> 12510.73s]  This is...
[12510.73s -> 12512.01s]  I'm going against the grain here.
[12513.90s -> 12516.54s]  Usually I do the event and then that's it.
[12516.54s -> 12518.86s]  But I've been having a lot of fun.
[12518.86s -> 12519.10s]  All right.
[12519.10s -> 12520.94s]  So let's put the car valet in there.
[12521.50s -> 12522.30s]  Deserves to be there.
[12523.02s -> 12526.52s]  Let's get rid of the paybacks though because they're not fair.
[12532.14s -> 12535.39s]  Wall dad put in super jex.
[12535.39s -> 12536.43s]  That's going to be so...
[12536.43s -> 12537.63s]  They're going to win.
[12537.63s -> 12539.07s]  Super jex is going to win.
[12539.07s -> 12539.31s]  All right.
[12539.31s -> 12540.19s]  We'll put wall dad in.
[12540.91s -> 12547.55s]  Blue man.
[12547.55s -> 12547.79s]  All right.
[12547.79s -> 12548.75s]  Blue man deserves to be there.
[12548.75s -> 12549.15s]  You're right.
[12551.26s -> 12552.14s]  And last one.
[12554.64s -> 12555.04s]  Otto.
[12555.77s -> 12556.73s]  Now Willem Dafoe.
[12557.45s -> 12557.85s]  I agree.
[12558.73s -> 12559.05s]  All right.
[12559.69s -> 12562.41s]  Sand low hornet, sands, fireman, wall dad, Willem Dafoe, car valet,
[12562.41s -> 12564.09s]  blue man in an eight man ladder match.
[12564.09s -> 12565.13s]  Before it was six man.
[12565.85s -> 12567.21s]  And I thought that was too much.
[12567.21s -> 12572.97s]  So entrance is off.
[12575.13s -> 12575.77s]  They all like...
[12575.77s -> 12579.05s]  Look, I didn't make entrances for people that weren't going to be in the like actual card.
[12579.85s -> 12581.50s]  Let's go.
[12581.50s -> 12584.36s]  Place your bets.
[12585.00s -> 12587.80s]  And who's going to win the eight fucking man ladder match?
[12591.37s -> 12596.38s]  I'm saying like a bunch of fucking dumb asses.
[12599.04s -> 12599.36s]  All right.
[12599.36s -> 12600.00s]  Good luck.
[12600.00s -> 12601.21s]  Good luck to who?
[12602.01s -> 12602.33s]  Wow.
[12602.33s -> 12603.05s]  What a joke.
[12604.32s -> 12605.84s]  This is an absolute joke.
[12606.72s -> 12607.60s]  Nothing's going to get done.
[12610.54s -> 12611.74s]  Nothing's going to get done.
[12615.26s -> 12616.46s]  There's too many people.
[12616.46s -> 12617.66s]  There's two ladders.
[12618.30s -> 12619.82s]  What a reversal by Willem Dafoe.
[12620.62s -> 12622.20s]  Car valet is already outside.
[12622.20s -> 12623.32s]  Adam Sandler in the car valet.
[12624.12s -> 12625.31s]  All right.
[12625.31s -> 12625.87s]  What time is it?
[12626.51s -> 12628.03s]  It's 8.09 Pacific.
[12628.75s -> 12630.64s]  I bet you this takes 30 minutes.
[12631.36s -> 12636.70s]  Hope to God you guys like watching this because this is going to take an hour.
[12643.95s -> 12644.35s]  Duel.
[12644.91s -> 12647.26s]  Hornet and wall dad outside there.
[12647.90s -> 12650.38s]  It's interesting because there's a pair for everything.
[12650.94s -> 12652.30s]  Two, four, six, eight.
[12653.34s -> 12654.30s]  It's one of the pairs.
[12654.94s -> 12657.74s]  Wall dad and wall hornet are fighting.
[12657.74s -> 12658.86s]  Which is weird.
[12658.86s -> 12659.58s]  Kind of strange.
[12661.63s -> 12662.75s]  Blue man and Willem Dafoe.
[12666.24s -> 12667.84s]  Wall dad is really trying to get rid of those hornets.
[12668.48s -> 12672.14s]  Sandler in car valet.
[12678.06s -> 12679.74s]  Is this louder than it typically is?
[12679.74s -> 12681.02s]  Why is it so loud?
[12684.22s -> 12685.42s]  Sand's in fire, man.
[12687.72s -> 12688.12s]  It's weird.
[12688.12s -> 12690.12s]  The two fucking weird characters are fighting.
[12691.00s -> 12693.82s]  The two human characters are fighting.
[12693.82s -> 12696.06s]  And the two comic book characters are fighting.
[12697.02s -> 12699.20s]  You saw me do it.
[12699.20s -> 12700.32s]  I didn't fucking do it.
[12700.32s -> 12701.60s]  Wall dad, wall hornet.
[12701.60s -> 12703.12s]  Two normal guys.
[12703.12s -> 12704.40s]  Car valet, Adam Sandler.
[12704.40s -> 12705.36s]  Comic book characters.
[12706.08s -> 12707.20s]  Blue man, Willem Dafoe.
[12707.20s -> 12708.80s]  And the two weirdos, fireman and sand.
[12709.60s -> 12711.77s]  I didn't do that.
[12712.73s -> 12713.85s]  It just did it itself.
[12719.36s -> 12720.72s]  Wall dad is like, I'm doing this.
[12721.36s -> 12722.56s]  I'm doing this for my son.
[12725.07s -> 12726.11s]  Fucking minecon.
[12727.85s -> 12730.41s]  Big clothesline there from Willem Dafoe on the car valet.
[12733.39s -> 12734.27s]  Great commentary.
[12734.91s -> 12739.44s]  Yes, minecon.
[12740.00s -> 12744.00s]  What's with the ring?
[12744.64s -> 12745.52s]  Holy shit.
[12747.71s -> 12752.36s]  Wall dad just absolutely annihilated the hornet.
[12752.36s -> 12755.40s]  Just punched him in the face so hard that he fell into the ladder.
[12756.20s -> 12760.35s]  Blue man now getting a couple of shots on fireman
[12760.35s -> 12761.87s]  who has rolled onto the outside.
[12763.63s -> 12764.83s]  Wall dad with a wall knee.
[12765.47s -> 12767.48s]  Blue man is going up.
[12767.48s -> 12770.28s]  He wants to win at least one competition, right?
[12772.32s -> 12774.32s]  Blue man has to win a fucking competition.
[12774.32s -> 12776.08s]  He's been around for like six years.
[12776.88s -> 12779.32s]  Can he please win something?
[12781.93s -> 12783.45s]  No, apparently not.
[12783.45s -> 12789.76s]  Willem Dafoe puts a quick work of blue man
[12790.72s -> 12793.28s]  while the two human characters are still fighting.
[12794.08s -> 12797.68s]  Sandler and car valet are still fighting each other.
[12798.56s -> 12801.29s]  Adam Sandler is kicking his ass somehow.
[12805.55s -> 12807.87s]  Why is fireman just sitting there?
[12808.83s -> 12810.59s]  Fireman does not understand what to do.
[12811.15s -> 12813.47s]  I mean he does have like four brain cells
[12813.47s -> 12815.71s]  so you really can't put that on him.
[12815.71s -> 12817.07s]  He probably could have won the match right there
[12817.07s -> 12819.95s]  but he decided he decided he's not gonna do it.
[12820.59s -> 12823.96s]  He'd rather throw blue man out and go after him
[12823.96s -> 12825.00s]  rather than win the match.
[12825.88s -> 12827.56s]  He could have just won.
[12827.56s -> 12829.40s]  And now the hornet's going up there to try to win the game.
[12830.04s -> 12834.36s]  Adam Sandler now is the only person in the ring that has any eyeballs
[12834.36s -> 12835.64s]  and he's not doing anything.
[12835.64s -> 12837.56s]  He's gonna go up the other side of the fucking ladder
[12838.28s -> 12839.72s]  stops the hornet potentially.
[12840.76s -> 12842.68s]  Adam Sandler now has an opportunity
[12842.68s -> 12845.80s]  but wall dad coming in to take a fucking wall down.
[12846.52s -> 12848.67s]  Oh he's not strong enough.
[12848.67s -> 12850.03s]  He's not strong enough.
[12852.41s -> 12854.73s]  Come on with all your dad strength.
[12854.73s -> 12856.17s]  Take the fucking wall down.
[12856.89s -> 12858.01s]  There it is.
[12858.57s -> 12861.26s]  He's from house flipper.
[12861.26s -> 12862.30s]  He's fucking strong.
[12868.36s -> 12869.56s]  Oh my god.
[12869.56s -> 12871.20s]  He did it.
[12872.27s -> 12873.55s]  Wall dad saves the day.
[12878.06s -> 12879.26s]  This is never gonna get done.
[12882.46s -> 12883.18s]  Big.
[12883.26s -> 12884.38s]  No I thought it was gonna be a powerbomb.
[12884.38s -> 12885.26s]  Willem Dafoe on the ground.
[12885.26s -> 12889.24s]  Now Sands going after Willem Dafoe on the back with the ladder
[12889.24s -> 12890.28s]  and now on the stomach.
[12890.28s -> 12891.56s]  Hornet is taking a break
[12892.20s -> 12896.60s]  while blue man has like three dead bodies in front of him.
[12896.60s -> 12899.00s]  Adam Sandler is unconscious sitting up.
[12900.35s -> 12901.87s]  No he seems to be coming too.
[12903.08s -> 12905.40s]  Sands under tail or should I say Deltarune
[12905.40s -> 12907.00s]  going up to the top of the fucking top rope
[12907.00s -> 12908.52s]  to get the briefcase.
[12908.52s -> 12910.52s]  Willem Dafoe is the only one that can see.
[12910.52s -> 12913.00s]  Wall dad get the fuck out of here.
[12913.72s -> 12915.08s]  I'm the only one that stops this.
[12915.08s -> 12915.72s]  No he doesn't care.
[12915.72s -> 12916.36s]  Willem Dafoe.
[12916.36s -> 12916.86s]  No.
[12921.34s -> 12922.30s]  Come on wall dad.
[12922.30s -> 12923.34s]  Take it to the wall down.
[12926.83s -> 12929.95s]  Wall dad again showing his brute house flipper strength.
[12936.83s -> 12939.15s]  Wall dad receiving a lot of punishment
[12939.15s -> 12941.07s]  for his saving the match.
[12941.07s -> 12941.95s]  Car valet.
[12942.91s -> 12943.71s]  Is that a car?
[12945.63s -> 12946.59s]  Declare.
[12946.59s -> 12948.43s]  He's going up to the top to get the briefcase.
[12948.99s -> 12951.84s]  Can Car valet end this right now
[12951.84s -> 12953.28s]  and cause a conniption?
[12956.19s -> 12956.69s]  No.
[12957.39s -> 12958.43s]  Hornet's going up top.
[12959.50s -> 12960.46s]  The conniption is over.
[12962.80s -> 12963.36s]  Is it though?
[12966.92s -> 12969.64s]  This is just a brutal multiple punches in the face.
[12969.64s -> 12970.92s]  Car valet is stopping this.
[12972.32s -> 12974.48s]  Somebody got really hurt and I don't know who it was.
[12974.48s -> 12975.36s]  Wall dad.
[12976.08s -> 12976.80s]  Wall dad.
[12979.47s -> 12981.47s]  He's like yeah I did it I fucking knocked it down
[12981.47s -> 12982.83s]  right into the Sands power bump.
[12985.79s -> 12988.35s]  You can never set up a you can't set up a ladder
[12988.35s -> 12989.07s]  in front of wall dad.
[12989.63s -> 12991.71s]  He'll take it down and put a bathtub in the other room.
[12993.61s -> 12994.89s]  Adam Sandler is dead.
[12995.69s -> 12996.19s]  Uh oh.
[12997.15s -> 13001.15s]  Sands undertale gonna unimpeded go up top here.
[13003.22s -> 13004.90s]  Wall dad with the strength.
[13004.90s -> 13006.58s]  Trying glue man now getting up here.
[13006.58s -> 13007.46s]  Hornet getting up here.
[13008.10s -> 13009.22s]  Can they stop it?
[13009.22s -> 13010.18s]  Big punches.
[13010.18s -> 13011.06s]  Jumping punch.
[13011.06s -> 13013.06s]  He decides to put hornet in a headlock.
[13013.06s -> 13016.66s]  Wall dad is going hard again.
[13016.66s -> 13017.86s]  He can't do it.
[13017.86s -> 13019.46s]  He can't do it.
[13019.46s -> 13021.86s]  Sands is gonna get the briefcase.
[13021.86s -> 13024.74s]  Somehow Adam Sandler and wall dad.
[13026.27s -> 13027.63s]  No he didn't get it.
[13027.63s -> 13028.13s]  He's up.
[13032.43s -> 13032.93s]  No.
[13033.55s -> 13036.91s]  Carvalli goes underneath his legs.
[13038.11s -> 13041.26s]  Oh nobody wins.
[13041.98s -> 13043.55s]  Hornet's on the top ropes.
[13044.67s -> 13047.89s]  What a stinger.
[13047.89s -> 13050.05s]  Let's call the stinger Willem Dafoe pointing to the crowd
[13050.05s -> 13050.69s]  to try to get some.
[13052.85s -> 13061.82s]  I can't even fucking talk.
[13065.04s -> 13065.84s]  Don't tell Harry.
[13066.48s -> 13068.48s]  Fireman going up to the top.
[13068.48s -> 13070.16s]  Is fireman gonna get the briefcase?
[13070.16s -> 13071.44s]  Can he do it unimpeded?
[13071.44s -> 13072.56s]  Willem Dafoe.
[13072.56s -> 13073.60s]  Hornet is coming up here.
[13074.24s -> 13076.08s]  Possibly to get it to stop.
[13076.80s -> 13077.92s]  Willem Dafoe no.
[13077.92s -> 13079.20s]  Pulling a wall dad.
[13079.20s -> 13082.24s]  Trying to get it to stop fireman holding on with his flames.
[13082.80s -> 13085.44s]  He lets go gets thrown up by the hornet.
[13085.44s -> 13089.36s]  Hornet is now it's their opportunity to try to get the briefcase.
[13090.08s -> 13091.28s]  Somebody call wall dad.
[13092.35s -> 13093.23s]  Hornet's gonna get it.
[13093.23s -> 13095.95s]  Nobody's Sands is standing there scratching his head.
[13097.31s -> 13098.27s]  The hornet is the winner.
[13108.74s -> 13110.34s]  Why is it showing us this?
[13111.54s -> 13116.96s]  Oh you kicked him who fucking cares.
[13116.96s -> 13118.48s]  You kicked him in the back of the leg.
[13119.20s -> 13121.04s]  Another chokeslam from Adam Sandler.
[13122.86s -> 13123.74s]  We don't even get to see it.
[13139.90s -> 13140.38s]  One more.
[13140.38s -> 13141.58s]  All right we'll do another one.
[13141.58s -> 13146.11s]  How many can you do in a backstage brawl?
[13146.83s -> 13152.18s]  Can I do more than five?
[13155.17s -> 13156.05s]  Fatal four way.
[13156.77s -> 13157.89s]  False count anywhere.
[13158.85s -> 13162.91s]  Triple threat.
[13162.91s -> 13163.87s]  False count anywhere.
[13164.51s -> 13171.04s]  Two on three.
[13171.04s -> 13171.76s]  One on two.
[13171.76s -> 13172.40s]  One on three.
[13175.14s -> 13179.81s]  Do another Helen.
[13179.81s -> 13181.49s]  I wish they would go up top for the Helen as well.
[13183.15s -> 13184.91s]  One on three versus super Jax.
[13186.94s -> 13187.66s]  All right fine.
[13188.22s -> 13189.34s]  One on three tag.
[13198.08s -> 13208.16s]  All right here's super Jax versus BF Bugleberry.
[13208.16s -> 13209.36s]  He's gonna he's a hundred.
[13209.36s -> 13210.00s]  I can't do that.
[13214.40s -> 13215.36s]  Versus the Sims.
[13221.58s -> 13222.86s]  Get wall dad back in there.
[13228.46s -> 13229.02s]  Sandler.
[13230.03s -> 13231.07s]  All the different germas.
[13232.14s -> 13233.34s]  All right how about wall dad.
[13233.34s -> 13234.14s]  Germa raptor.
[13237.73s -> 13247.09s]  And no.
[13247.09s -> 13247.73s]  Odd Michael.
[13247.73s -> 13248.53s]  Fuck odd Michael.
[13248.53s -> 13249.01s]  And Lou.
[13249.57s -> 13253.04s]  That sounds like a pretty good fight.
[13254.93s -> 13258.29s]  No Adam Sandler's been a part of like three of the last five matches.
[13259.01s -> 13262.51s]  All right let's do it.
[13263.52s -> 13264.56s]  Match options.
[13264.56s -> 13266.24s]  All right uh referee.
[13267.20s -> 13268.00s]  Whatever who cares.
[13273.15s -> 13275.47s]  We want Adam Sandler.
[13275.47s -> 13279.66s]  What a bunch of bums.
[13281.30s -> 13282.42s]  Lou is a hundred.
[13283.06s -> 13284.02s]  As he should be.
[13284.74s -> 13287.30s]  Oh it's actually a tag match.
[13287.30s -> 13290.58s]  Wall dad is in there first so it's not tornado tag.
[13293.09s -> 13293.73s]  Snickers.
[13295.49s -> 13298.05s]  Oh yeah that's like Snickers logos in the game.
[13300.08s -> 13302.77s]  Go with the elbow drop there for wall dad.
[13303.41s -> 13304.90s]  He's got that knee brace on.
[13304.90s -> 13305.86s]  He's got a bad knee.
[13306.58s -> 13311.46s]  Please beat him right now.
[13311.46s -> 13311.94s]  Wall dad.
[13312.66s -> 13315.26s]  Oh well.
[13315.26s -> 13317.42s]  Super Jax versus Snickers.
[13317.42s -> 13318.54s]  I'm not making.
[13318.54s -> 13319.18s]  That's it.
[13319.18s -> 13319.66s]  Game's over.
[13324.11s -> 13327.15s]  Wall dad somehow is destroying Jax.
[13327.15s -> 13331.23s]  No super Jax with the overhead throw there.
[13335.44s -> 13337.20s]  Super wall versus super Jax.
[13337.20s -> 13337.60s]  That's right.
[13338.24s -> 13341.01s]  Dragging him to the middle of the ring.
[13341.01s -> 13342.45s]  Super Jax is gonna grab his arm.
[13343.25s -> 13344.85s]  What's he doing here?
[13344.85s -> 13347.33s]  Oh of course the secret fucking technique.
[13348.05s -> 13351.47s]  Doesn't matter how strong you are that always works.
[13352.03s -> 13355.22s]  He's got wall dad in a submission here.
[13356.02s -> 13359.04s]  Hopefully get a tag in.
[13359.76s -> 13361.46s]  Otherwise wall dad looks like he could be.
[13361.46s -> 13363.94s]  No what a knee to the face of super Jax.
[13364.58s -> 13366.74s]  Two infinity gauntlets is not enough.
[13366.82s -> 13371.86s]  For a minecon 2013 gift bag with two stickers.
[13372.42s -> 13374.42s]  And a diamond pickaxe plastic toy.
[13374.42s -> 13375.14s]  It's not enough.
[13375.70s -> 13382.46s]  He's got dad instinct.
[13385.71s -> 13386.35s]  Nice.
[13386.35s -> 13388.43s]  What a just charging dash.
[13388.43s -> 13389.71s]  And here comes German Raptor.
[13391.06s -> 13392.34s]  The worst person you could have tagged in.
[13392.34s -> 13393.30s]  You should have tagged in Luke.
[13393.94s -> 13398.82s]  German Raptor now is going to get instantly power bombed.
[13401.92s -> 13402.64s]  Okay.
[13402.64s -> 13403.20s]  Good work.
[13403.92s -> 13404.48s]  Good work.
[13405.04s -> 13406.00s]  Shittiest thing ever.
[13407.95s -> 13409.71s]  He's just beating the shit out of his head.
[13410.27s -> 13411.73s]  He's already done.
[13411.73s -> 13412.05s]  He's dead.
[13412.77s -> 13413.25s]  Game over.
[13413.89s -> 13416.43s]  Come on.
[13416.43s -> 13417.71s]  Do like a Raptor move.
[13423.28s -> 13424.32s]  Fuck you super Jax.
[13424.32s -> 13425.68s]  You get two infinity gauntlets.
[13425.68s -> 13427.36s]  I get a mask from Walmart.
[13428.24s -> 13430.66s]  This is embarrassing again.
[13432.16s -> 13433.44s]  Get Lou Elbertson in there.
[13433.44s -> 13434.56s]  He at least has a chance.
[13435.36s -> 13441.82s]  German Raptor is about to go extinct.
[13442.38s -> 13444.21s]  Just stepping on his head.
[13444.21s -> 13445.17s]  Going to the top rope.
[13445.17s -> 13446.37s]  Somebody get in there please.
[13451.63s -> 13452.91s]  Oh he missed with a stomp.
[13453.63s -> 13455.22s]  This is German Raptor's chance.
[13455.78s -> 13456.50s]  Into the corner.
[13457.60s -> 13458.16s]  Tag him in.
[13458.16s -> 13459.44s]  Let's get a double team here.
[13460.53s -> 13461.25s]  There we go.
[13461.25s -> 13462.21s]  Beautiful.
[13462.21s -> 13465.41s]  Walledad German Raptor with a double swinging slacks.
[13465.97s -> 13466.69s]  Whatever that means.
[13467.94s -> 13468.44s]  Teamwork.
[13472.48s -> 13473.68s]  Walledad now going to the corner.
[13473.68s -> 13474.56s]  Super Jax now.
[13474.56s -> 13475.44s]  Why would you tag it?
[13475.44s -> 13476.80s]  Walledad is so tired.
[13478.00s -> 13479.12s]  Oh dear.
[13479.12s -> 13479.84s]  That's not good.
[13479.84s -> 13480.80s]  We got a one.
[13480.80s -> 13481.76s]  We've got only one.
[13482.62s -> 13483.12s]  Only one.
[13485.60s -> 13486.10s]  Trying to.
[13487.04s -> 13494.30s]  You got nobody to tag in Walled.
[13495.20s -> 13495.70s]  German.
[13497.66s -> 13499.18s]  What the fuck is this?
[13501.33s -> 13501.83s]  Oh no.
[13502.45s -> 13505.09s]  He just put his legs in the air and put them up and down.
[13506.61s -> 13507.65s]  Some super Jax.
[13507.65s -> 13508.37s]  Throw him outside.
[13509.01s -> 13510.05s]  Let's get Lou in here.
[13510.05s -> 13511.33s]  Walledad going to Lou maybe.
[13511.33s -> 13511.83s]  No.
[13512.45s -> 13515.20s]  Tagging back in German Raptor.
[13516.77s -> 13517.49s]  What is this?
[13519.57s -> 13520.93s]  German Raptor didn't do anything.
[13522.16s -> 13523.84s]  He pretended like he helped.
[13523.84s -> 13525.04s]  All he did was jump up the ropes.
[13525.04s -> 13525.54s]  That's it.
[13526.80s -> 13529.76s]  And look what happened.
[13529.76s -> 13530.80s]  Oh yeah.
[13530.80s -> 13531.36s]  Nice, nice.
[13531.36s -> 13532.40s]  Good work German Raptor.
[13533.12s -> 13533.92s]  Watch out for the riff.
[13534.64s -> 13538.40s]  Super Jax is going up top.
[13538.96s -> 13541.04s]  Going for another somersault pin here.
[13541.04s -> 13541.54s]  One.
[13541.84s -> 13542.64s]  That's all they're going to get.
[13543.28s -> 13547.36s]  Are we going to get even get to see Lou in this whole match?
[13551.51s -> 13552.31s]  He's 100.
[13552.31s -> 13554.71s]  He has 100 stats and he's just sitting out there hanging up.
[13558.85s -> 13559.65s]  That's right Lou.
[13560.53s -> 13561.17s]  Uncle Lou.
[13562.72s -> 13563.52s]  T-pose.
[13566.15s -> 13567.91s]  German Raptor has Jax in the corner.
[13569.24s -> 13570.84s]  You could have guessed that was going to happen.
[13571.88s -> 13575.00s]  Big crashing downward spiral into the mat there.
[13575.00s -> 13577.80s]  German Raptor is in a lot of trouble in the corner.
[13579.08s -> 13580.92s]  Super Jax is on the top rope again.
[13580.92s -> 13583.88s]  The same flipping scoop powerbomb thing.
[13583.88s -> 13585.08s]  And Walledad can't handle it.
[13585.72s -> 13587.00s]  Walledad saying this is bullshit.
[13587.00s -> 13588.04s]  He's got 100 stats.
[13588.04s -> 13588.68s]  It's not fair.
[13592.36s -> 13593.64s]  Walledad coming out of the walls.
[13594.74s -> 13596.10s]  Behind the wall you could say.
[13596.82s -> 13599.19s]  Look at this dad instinct.
[13599.83s -> 13600.47s]  Saved the day.
[13601.56s -> 13602.76s]  Now Jerma Jax.
[13602.76s -> 13604.92s]  Super Jax is going for the next snap.
[13604.92s -> 13605.56s]  Will he get it?
[13606.20s -> 13607.84s]  No he will not.
[13607.84s -> 13611.60s]  It's powering up here.
[13611.60s -> 13612.72s]  The two infinity gauntlets.
[13613.28s -> 13615.28s]  He's got the mind stone and the power stone.
[13615.28s -> 13617.44s]  He can control all of reality.
[13617.44s -> 13619.44s]  And that's all it took was one, two punches.
[13620.16s -> 13622.74s]  And a badly to back suplex on his neck.
[13625.24s -> 13629.08s]  The people reaching out desperately to get a tag from German Raptor.
[13629.08s -> 13632.20s]  They know he's the shittiest character in this entire rumble.
[13633.32s -> 13634.76s]  No German Raptor.
[13634.76s -> 13635.08s]  No.
[13635.08s -> 13636.20s]  Nobody cares.
[13636.20s -> 13637.00s]  It's not cool.
[13637.80s -> 13638.84s]  Tag out.
[13638.84s -> 13639.88s]  You have to tag out now.
[13640.52s -> 13645.70s]  Before you keep embarrassing yourself.
[13646.50s -> 13647.38s]  Tag Lu in.
[13648.37s -> 13648.93s]  Tag out.
[13650.39s -> 13650.79s]  No.
[13650.79s -> 13652.31s]  You stop proving yourself.
[13652.87s -> 13655.03s]  This is the worst joke you've ever made.
[13655.03s -> 13656.15s]  Stop trying to prove it.
[13656.15s -> 13656.95s]  It's worth doing.
[13658.04s -> 13659.08s]  See look what happened.
[13659.72s -> 13661.48s]  He's like no I can make it funny.
[13661.48s -> 13662.92s]  I'll go.
[13662.92s -> 13664.12s]  No it's not funny.
[13664.12s -> 13664.76s]  It's not gonna happen.
[13664.76s -> 13665.56s]  It's not gonna be funny.
[13689.35s -> 13690.55s]  Jerma gets out of the top row.
[13690.55s -> 13692.79s]  What a reversal there by Jerma Raptor.
[13693.59s -> 13694.87s]  All the shit we just talked.
[13696.34s -> 13698.66s]  Oh boy he got hit right in the skull.
[13700.84s -> 13702.60s]  You don't stand a chance against Super Jax.
[13702.60s -> 13703.48s]  Use your teammates.
[13703.48s -> 13705.24s]  Use your friends and your family members.
[13705.24s -> 13706.92s]  There's one right next to you with a hundred stats.
[13706.92s -> 13707.88s]  Stop staring at him.
[13711.76s -> 13712.72s]  He scoops him up.
[13712.72s -> 13713.60s]  How can he pick him up?
[13713.60s -> 13714.72s]  He's like a thousand pounds.
[13715.60s -> 13716.56s]  Holy shit.
[13717.84s -> 13718.64s]  Holy shit.
[13720.08s -> 13721.60s]  He's got a lot to prove.
[13721.60s -> 13722.80s]  Drag him to the middle of the ring.
[13723.36s -> 13738.96s]  And he's going for the pin.
[13739.52s -> 13742.29s]  Can we get a one two.
[13742.29s -> 13743.33s]  Oh a two count.
[13743.33s -> 13744.13s]  Oh unbelievable.
[13744.13s -> 13745.25s]  I can't believe he got out of that one.
[13746.05s -> 13748.37s]  Jerma Raptor had a chance there.
[13748.37s -> 13749.17s]  A small chance.
[13749.17s -> 13750.77s]  Oh what a lariat with a leg.
[13750.77s -> 13752.21s]  A leg lariat as you would say.
[13753.09s -> 13753.97s]  By Super Jax.
[13757.30s -> 13757.94s]  There it is.
[13758.66s -> 13759.38s]  There it is.
[13759.38s -> 13760.82s]  The spindy doodle.
[13760.82s -> 13763.30s]  I've said that word like 30 times already.
[13763.30s -> 13764.26s]  It's not tagging.
[13765.06s -> 13765.94s]  Wall dad's coming in.
[13768.37s -> 13770.21s]  Lou is essentially a manager right now.
[13770.21s -> 13771.89s]  And then Super Jax is like fuck this.
[13771.89s -> 13773.73s]  I'll see you next time or the next episode.
[13773.73s -> 13774.93s]  And it's the next episode.
[13774.93s -> 13775.81s]  It's the next episode.
[13776.45s -> 13786.79s]  And there it is.
[13786.79s -> 13787.35s]  He got him in the back.
[13788.31s -> 13790.39s]  Backwards elbow by wall dad.
[13792.23s -> 13793.83s]  Scoops him up with a choke slam.
[13793.83s -> 13794.95s]  Could that be it?
[13794.95s -> 13795.67s]  That's one.
[13796.71s -> 13797.27s]  That's two.
[13798.15s -> 13799.27s]  Can he get the third one?
[13799.99s -> 13800.79s]  He got the third one.
[13801.51s -> 13803.36s]  Can wall dad close this one out?
[13803.36s -> 13805.52s]  Can it be the end of the situation here for Super Jax?
[13807.32s -> 13809.16s]  Can we get to the end of the season already?
[13810.84s -> 13811.88s]  Into the corner he goes.
[13812.76s -> 13813.48s]  Wall dad.
[13814.20s -> 13832.55s]  And he gets a pin.
[13832.55s -> 13833.43s]  And a power bump.
[13833.99s -> 13834.55s]  Wall dad.
[13835.51s -> 13836.71s]  He's got him in the.
[13837.19s -> 13837.83s]  Sacrific.
[13837.83s -> 13838.39s]  There it is.
[13839.75s -> 13840.87s]  The sacrificial wall.
[13841.59s -> 13845.01s]  I can't believe he just did it.
[13846.15s -> 13847.99s]  That's called the wall knockdown.
[13847.99s -> 13849.67s]  The sacrificial wall knockdown.
[13850.31s -> 13860.44s]  Here comes a pin.
[13861.96s -> 13862.28s]  One.
[13863.00s -> 13864.36s]  Oh, only one.
[13864.36s -> 13865.16s]  I wonder why.
[13865.80s -> 13867.16s]  I wonder why that happened.
[13869.16s -> 13871.72s]  Maybe if you pinned him after doing the move.
[13872.28s -> 13874.61s]  It might not have happened.
[13874.61s -> 13876.13s]  As wall dad goes into the corner.
[13877.43s -> 13878.31s]  We've got us.
[13878.31s -> 13879.67s]  Oh, he did the diaper.
[13879.67s -> 13880.95s]  That's a super diaper.
[13882.02s -> 13884.74s]  Super Jax for the super diaper on his super fucking face.
[13886.48s -> 13887.04s]  Right hand.
[13888.58s -> 13889.46s]  Got him on the neck.
[13889.46s -> 13890.18s]  Spinning back.
[13890.18s -> 13891.46s]  Backward suplex.
[13891.46s -> 13892.18s]  Into the diaper.
[13892.82s -> 13894.26s]  He has multiple diaper moves.
[13894.82s -> 13896.36s]  That's diaper two he calls it.
[13897.28s -> 13898.24s]  2.0.
[13898.24s -> 13898.74s]  Whoa!
[13899.44s -> 13906.44s]  Uh oh, he's got him in the bad boy.
[13906.44s -> 13907.72s]  He's like, you're a bad boy.
[13908.36s -> 13911.65s]  Is this gonna be it?
[13911.65s -> 13912.85s]  Can he end it?
[13912.85s -> 13914.05s]  With the bad boy?
[13921.17s -> 13922.29s]  No, he's not.
[13922.29s -> 13923.73s]  He's gonna get power bombed.
[13925.62s -> 13926.12s]  One.
[13926.82s -> 13927.32s]  Two.
[13928.18s -> 13929.46s]  Oh, Lou made an attempt.
[13933.91s -> 13936.07s]  Somebody just wrote, I'm unfollowing.
[13937.20s -> 13937.70s]  Nice.
[13944.05s -> 13945.57s]  Wall dad catches the leg.
[13947.25s -> 13947.97s]  Can he get him?
[13948.93s -> 13950.45s]  With the backwards neck breaking.
[13954.31s -> 13955.99s]  He's getting energy from twitch chat.
[13957.40s -> 13959.88s]  Wall dad should have been the guy who picked up two lariat.
[13960.84s -> 13961.34s]  Three.
[13962.36s -> 13963.16s]  That's gonna be it.
[13964.92s -> 13966.92s]  He calls everyone the sledgehammer.
[13966.92s -> 13970.45s]  He's gonna do it again?
[13971.09s -> 13973.41s]  No, that's 640 pounds.
[13973.41s -> 13975.89s]  You gotta be a goddamn titan to be able to pick that up.
[13978.84s -> 13981.64s]  Lou is watching ever so patiently as supergex.
[13984.52s -> 13985.96s]  Here comes germa raptor.
[13986.52s -> 13987.96s]  What the hell are they doing?
[13987.96s -> 13991.72s]  He's helping him getting on his shoulders.
[13991.72s -> 13993.72s]  Germa raptor is going for the raptor lunge.
[13995.83s -> 13996.55s]  That's gonna be it.
[14001.22s -> 14001.86s]  Teamwork!
[14003.12s -> 14006.56s]  Can they put an end to supergex once and for all as three?
[14006.56s -> 14007.36s]  I mean two.
[14008.00s -> 14009.52s]  Because Lou hasn't done anything.
[14009.52s -> 14011.04s]  He's stood there the whole time.
[14011.04s -> 14012.80s]  No, he's gonna get power bombed again.
[14012.80s -> 14013.76s]  Hey, how about this one?
[14013.76s -> 14014.24s]  Remember that?
[14016.68s -> 14017.64s]  Hey, get out of here.
[14017.64s -> 14018.20s]  I'm Lou.
[14018.20s -> 14019.24s]  I'll do something once.
[14020.53s -> 14021.17s]  Watch my looks.
[14021.17s -> 14022.45s]  Isn't that a cool kick?
[14023.09s -> 14032.47s]  Going to the top rope is supergex slowly though.
[14032.47s -> 14033.43s]  What's the move here?
[14035.14s -> 14036.10s]  What's the move here?
[14037.81s -> 14038.85s]  Oh dear.
[14038.85s -> 14039.25s]  This is...
[14039.89s -> 14040.37s]  That's it.
[14040.37s -> 14041.57s]  That has to be the end.
[14041.57s -> 14043.81s]  That's 20,000 pounds on his chest.
[14043.81s -> 14045.01s]  He doesn't have a chest anymore.
[14045.01s -> 14045.97s]  Wall dad coming in.
[14046.92s -> 14048.52s]  Catching his dad instinct.
[14048.52s -> 14049.97s]  Stay with my son.
[14050.53s -> 14051.75s]  How dare you?
[14054.21s -> 14054.69s]  Oh shit.
[14054.69s -> 14057.73s]  My like four-year-old almost fell down off a cliff.
[14057.73s -> 14059.65s]  I got him though in that Reddit video.
[14060.82s -> 14061.30s]  I caught him.
[14061.30s -> 14062.66s]  I got a wall dad instinct.
[14067.38s -> 14068.26s]  What the fuck?
[14073.56s -> 14074.12s]  Oh, it's okay.
[14074.12s -> 14075.24s]  I'll go back to Reddit.
[14075.88s -> 14083.99s]  Turbo raptor with a toss.
[14083.99s -> 14084.95s]  And he's getting ready.
[14085.75s -> 14087.67s]  He's getting ready for his signature move.
[14087.67s -> 14088.39s]  Oh, there it was.
[14088.39s -> 14089.59s]  I didn't have time to tell you what it was.
[14095.67s -> 14097.35s]  Into the corner, Jex goes.
[14099.01s -> 14100.21s]  Who is he going to tag in?
[14100.21s -> 14101.41s]  Oh, I wonder.
[14101.41s -> 14101.97s]  Is it going to be...
[14128.15s -> 14128.87s]  A suplex.
[14129.43s -> 14133.64s]  Pulling him into the center of the ring.
[14149.59s -> 14149.91s]  One.
[14150.90s -> 14151.14s]  Two.
[14153.54s -> 14155.76s]  That's too bad.
[14155.76s -> 14157.68s]  Germa raptor going for a pin.
[14157.68s -> 14158.72s]  Didn't get it though.
[14159.36s -> 14160.32s]  Into the corner again.
[14163.72s -> 14167.80s]  Here comes Lou Albertson to stop this and end the fucking match.
[14167.80s -> 14168.92s]  Well, they bumped into each other.
[14169.40s -> 14170.28s]  They're going for it again.
[14171.67s -> 14172.71s]  He loves his uncle.
[14173.43s -> 14174.55s]  It's his favorite uncle.
[14176.47s -> 14177.83s]  Lou Albertson coming in.
[14178.96s -> 14180.00s]  Let's see if he can...
[14180.00s -> 14181.36s]  He's doing the arm pull.
[14182.00s -> 14183.52s]  He used to work in a meat factory.
[14184.98s -> 14186.18s]  He knows how to pull chicken.
[14188.55s -> 14189.51s]  Up to the top rope.
[14189.51s -> 14191.11s]  He's finally got his pounding his chest.
[14191.11s -> 14191.59s]  That's right.
[14199.70s -> 14202.10s]  Oh, he got reversed by super Jex.
[14204.05s -> 14205.25s]  He makes a great pulled chicken.
[14205.25s -> 14206.77s]  He brings it to fucking Thanksgiving every year.
[14206.77s -> 14208.13s]  We don't do turkey.
[14208.13s -> 14208.85s]  We do chicken.
[14209.41s -> 14212.42s]  We do fucking Boston market chicken.
[14213.06s -> 14215.40s]  We go to the Boston market and we get chicken.
[14216.12s -> 14217.80s]  Corner to corner, Lou Albertson.
[14218.82s -> 14219.38s]  That's two.
[14220.10s -> 14221.51s]  Can he go for a third?
[14222.85s -> 14223.81s]  Into the third corner.
[14235.92s -> 14236.96s]  Go after him?
[14236.96s -> 14237.84s]  Do I fight him?
[14242.32s -> 14244.16s]  Do I fight the guy in the corner?
[14244.16s -> 14245.12s]  He'll get him.
[14245.12s -> 14245.68s]  I don't know.
[14245.68s -> 14246.08s]  Should I?
[14248.88s -> 14249.28s]  Maybe?
[14249.28s -> 14250.24s]  I don't know.
[14250.24s -> 14250.96s]  He gets it!
[14250.96s -> 14251.44s]  Right hand!
[14252.16s -> 14252.80s]  Lou Albertson!
[14253.76s -> 14255.92s]  And that's called the Thanksgiving Turkey Chicken Dinner.
[14256.56s -> 14257.75s]  Didn't even get a chance.
[14262.68s -> 14264.68s]  Oh, he threw his hand into the ground.
[14264.68s -> 14265.48s]  Unbelievable.
[14266.28s -> 14267.89s]  Going for the neck break.
[14268.53s -> 14272.13s]  Can somebody finally get the neck break to end a match?
[14273.30s -> 14274.10s]  Nope.
[14274.10s -> 14277.01s]  Go for it again.
[14277.65s -> 14281.65s]  No, he gets reversed in a clothesline by super Jex on Lou Albertson.
[14281.65s -> 14287.03s]  Albertson trying to take his head clean off of his shoulders.
[14287.75s -> 14289.43s]  Did not seem to work in this scenario.
[14289.43s -> 14290.31s]  Now we've got...
[14290.31s -> 14293.11s]  Oh, he's dragging him around like fucking dirty underwear on the ground.
[14293.83s -> 14295.49s]  He's kind of by the neck.
[14295.49s -> 14297.41s]  That's a very bad position to be in.
[14298.05s -> 14300.36s]  Is he going to break Lou's neck?
[14300.36s -> 14300.76s]  No!
[14300.76s -> 14302.20s]  Lou reversed it!
[14302.20s -> 14302.92s]  Somehow!
[14302.92s -> 14303.48s]  Ooh!
[14303.48s -> 14305.48s]  Took a slap into his face!
[14305.48s -> 14306.28s]  Oh, my face!
[14307.48s -> 14309.96s]  He's got a backwards suplex into the diaper!
[14309.96s -> 14311.32s]  The dupe diaper 2.0!
[14312.12s -> 14318.82s]  Why would you...
[14318.82s -> 14319.38s]  All right.
[14319.38s -> 14319.70s]  One!
[14320.34s -> 14322.82s]  Not even a one count on Lou Albertson.
[14322.82s -> 14328.50s]  Why is every move the diaper?
[14329.06s -> 14330.26s]  That's the diaper 2.0.
[14330.26s -> 14331.46s]  The diaper 1 is the double...
[14332.18s -> 14333.86s]  The feet jump into the ground.
[14333.86s -> 14335.14s]  He jumps in the air and kicks you.
[14335.70s -> 14336.74s]  Diaper 1, diaper 2.
[14338.98s -> 14340.74s]  Just taunting Lou Albertson here.
[14342.53s -> 14344.45s]  As Lou, it does not look good.
[14344.45s -> 14347.89s]  He's got great stats, but he can't go up against the Infinity Gauntlet.
[14347.89s -> 14349.01s]  He throws him outside.
[14349.01s -> 14350.13s]  He doesn't give a fuck.
[14350.77s -> 14352.08s]  He's going to win?
[14352.08s -> 14352.64s]  No, he's going to wait.
[14352.64s -> 14353.44s]  Is he going to go up top?
[14354.00s -> 14355.52s]  He's like, I like this one better.
[14355.52s -> 14356.48s]  He's up top.
[14356.48s -> 14358.48s]  Is Jermaraptor going to cause a problem here for him?
[14358.48s -> 14360.08s]  No, I would go like this one.
[14361.16s -> 14361.64s]  No, no.
[14361.64s -> 14363.88s]  I think I'm going to do this one.
[14365.30s -> 14366.50s]  Let me try this one.
[14366.50s -> 14367.00s]  No.
[14368.90s -> 14369.70s]  Top left part is better.
[14370.66s -> 14372.10s]  No, I think I'll just go out there.
[14372.10s -> 14374.34s]  My brain is fucking adult Swiss cheese.
[14377.70s -> 14378.66s]  And there he goes.
[14378.66s -> 14380.42s]  Lou Albertson goes down.
[14380.42s -> 14381.46s]  Now we got two count.
[14381.46s -> 14382.74s]  20 count means the end of the match.
[14384.08s -> 14385.60s]  Nice reversal into the balls.
[14386.53s -> 14389.32s]  Will it be enough to stop Super Jex?
[14389.32s -> 14390.68s]  I don't think so.
[14390.68s -> 14393.54s]  He's going to throw him into the crowd.
[14393.54s -> 14396.24s]  No, just into the banister here.
[14396.24s -> 14401.04s]  Five seconds have elapsed.
[14401.04s -> 14403.20s]  Right hand, left hand, right hand.
[14403.20s -> 14404.16s]  This is bad.
[14404.16s -> 14405.12s]  This is really bad.
[14409.17s -> 14409.97s]  Oh, come on.
[14409.97s -> 14412.29s]  A count out is literally the worst thing you could ever do.
[14413.16s -> 14414.76s]  Why is the ref not counting?
[14414.76s -> 14416.44s]  That was the longest eight seconds I've ever seen
[14416.44s -> 14419.35s]  in the history of the German arena.
[14419.35s -> 14420.79s]  And there goes Jerm-
[14422.31s -> 14423.59s]  Jermat Jex is in the ring.
[14440.85s -> 14443.09s]  Oh, make sure you show Lou clapping though.
[14443.09s -> 14443.65s]  That's great.
[14444.21s -> 14622.60s]  He doesn't need to be maxed.
[14622.60s -> 14653.92s]  He doesn't need that.
[14653.92s -> 14657.12s]  There's a wall dad, and here's a wall chat.
[14657.28s -> 14658.00s]  2.0.
[14663.89s -> 14664.61s]  What's the difference?
[14664.61s -> 14683.49s]  You have a glowing hat.
[14683.49s -> 14686.20s]  You can't beat Minecon 2013.
[14686.20s -> 14687.64s]  TLC match.
[14687.64s -> 14689.56s]  Wall chat 2.0 versus Jerm-
[14689.56s -> 14690.76s]  It's Super Jex.
[14690.76s -> 14698.04s]  Wall dad.
[14698.04s -> 14700.04s]  The only thing that needs to glow is his helmet.
[14701.44s -> 14704.32s]  Look, you can't even fucking do anything versus Minecon.
[14705.12s -> 14706.82s]  Remember when they announced sheep?
[14707.38s -> 14708.50s]  They're like wolves.
[14710.15s -> 14710.95s]  He was there for that.
[14712.53s -> 14713.97s]  He stood in line.
[14713.97s -> 14718.18s]  Hey, my son's like a real big fan of your YouTube channel.
[14718.82s -> 14720.82s]  Do you mind if I take a picture with you?
[14720.82s -> 14721.70s]  He was there for that.
[14721.70s -> 14722.34s]  Don't you understand?
[14731.48s -> 14735.36s]  Let's get some tables in here.
[14735.36s -> 14737.28s]  Do a mega version rumble.
[14737.28s -> 14738.56s]  That would take so long.
[14741.00s -> 14742.44s]  Hey, I mean, like, I know.
[14742.44s -> 14744.52s]  Hey, I just want to say that, you know,
[14746.32s -> 14748.96s]  little Jason is like such a huge fan of your channel.
[14749.60s -> 14753.20s]  He really loved when you played the Hunger Games.
[14753.84s -> 14756.32s]  Do you mind if I get like a picture with you?
[14756.32s -> 14757.44s]  Which is, well, him, not me.
[14758.24s -> 14758.72s]  Thanks, man.
[14770.00s -> 14771.92s]  Minecraft Hunger Games.
[14771.92s -> 14775.28s]  I'm not going to play Minecraft music.
[14775.28s -> 14777.28s]  This is probably the last match of the night.
[14785.36s -> 14788.64s]  Fucking my, no, what the hell just happened?
[14789.44s -> 14792.74s]  That was the equivalent of two planets colliding
[14792.74s -> 14794.34s]  and now they're outside under the tables.
[14794.34s -> 14795.70s]  The commentators are getting up.
[14796.34s -> 14799.75s]  We got a table from Super Jex,
[14799.75s -> 14802.39s]  but wall Chad 2.0 is going to stop that from happening.
[14804.88s -> 14806.48s]  They're bigger than the tables.
[14807.04s -> 14814.31s]  Uh-oh, where is Super Jex going?
[14815.48s -> 14817.08s]  Possibly to the ladder, it seems.
[14817.88s -> 14818.76s]  Yep, you got to get that.
[14818.76s -> 14819.88s]  You got to get the money up top.
[14820.60s -> 14823.32s]  You got to get your free two tickets to Minecon.
[14826.79s -> 14828.95s]  And wall dad is getting a table.
[14829.51s -> 14835.19s]  There is the ladder set up.
[14835.19s -> 14836.63s]  Nice dodge by Super Jex.
[14837.35s -> 14840.15s]  Wall Chad can't seem to get it right into the table.
[14842.21s -> 14844.37s]  Now that is devastating.
[14845.01s -> 14849.75s]  Super Jex is going to the outside for some reason.
[14849.75s -> 14850.47s]  I'm not sure why.
[14851.27s -> 14853.99s]  Yeah, wall dad brought out his own wall
[14854.79s -> 14862.23s]  and wall dad is going and getting the briefcase.
[14862.23s -> 14868.98s]  Super Jex is an observer
[14870.82s -> 14877.00s]  and he's fiddling with the hook there
[14877.72s -> 14882.15s]  and trying to get it.
[14882.15s -> 14882.79s]  It's a tough hook.
[14884.29s -> 14884.77s]  I almost got it.
[14884.77s -> 14885.97s]  No, he kind of fucked it up there.
[14885.97s -> 14887.25s]  He's going to try it again.
[14889.60s -> 14890.64s]  It's a tough lock.
[14891.36s -> 14894.52s]  Might take four, two sets of hands there.
[14894.52s -> 14895.88s]  No, he's got it.
[14895.88s -> 14896.68s]  Here it is.
[14913.70s -> 14915.14s]  Yeah, this is for my son.
[14916.34s -> 14918.02s]  Yeah, I can't believe it.
[14918.90s -> 14922.18s]  This is signed by all the YouTubers.
[14922.82s -> 14961.36s]  That's it.
[14967.11s -> 14972.85s]  I don't know what the hell that was
[14973.49s -> 14980.69s]  but we haven't done that before.
[14981.33s -> 14982.07s]  That was fun.
[14984.10s -> 14986.50s]  Well, the first like two hour and a half of the stream
[14986.50s -> 14987.54s]  was like the real shit
[14987.54s -> 14990.74s]  and then the last like three hours was bullshit.
[14991.30s -> 14992.24s]  But it was fun.
[14994.40s -> 14995.68s]  Thank you so much everybody for coming.
[14996.40s -> 14998.95s]  There were a lot.
[14998.95s -> 15001.19s]  I there was so many people here tonight.
[15001.19s -> 15002.07s]  I can't even believe it.
[15002.07s -> 15004.39s]  There's almost 10,000 people at the stream concurrently.
[15005.43s -> 15006.63s]  That's fucking out of control.
[15007.75s -> 15010.34s]  So thank you for participating.
[15010.34s -> 15011.46s]  Thanks for being part of the community
[15013.12s -> 15017.36s]  because a lot of these random characters are, you know,
[15018.00s -> 15019.76s]  at least half of them, more than half of them
[15019.76s -> 15021.44s]  because we thought they were fun and funny.
[15021.44s -> 15021.92s]  You know what I mean?
[15022.88s -> 15028.00s]  So thank you for participating everybody.
[15028.64s -> 15030.12s]  It's always a blast.
[15032.61s -> 15033.09s]  Good night.
[15034.24s -> 15035.12s]  Take care of yourself.
[15035.12s -> 15036.64s]  I will see you guys on Tuesday.
[15037.44s -> 15038.84s]  I'm going to take tomorrow off
[15038.84s -> 15041.88s]  because I really the last four days straight
[15042.68s -> 15044.29s]  I've kind of been making characters.
[15045.25s -> 15047.09s]  So I'm going to take tomorrow off.
[15047.09s -> 15047.97s]  I'll see you on Tuesday.
[15047.97s -> 15050.61s]  We'll probably, you know, I have no idea
[15050.61s -> 15051.97s]  what the fuck we're going to do on Tuesday.
[15051.97s -> 15052.69s]  That's a good question.
[15053.73s -> 15059.67s]  But if you're new, thanks for dropping by.
[15060.90s -> 15063.22s]  If not, then hey, good to see you again.
[15064.69s -> 15066.53s]  We're probably going to have fucked up credits
[15066.53s -> 15071.60s]  because of the I had stream labs turned off
[15071.60s -> 15073.44s]  just for the sake of because I wanted to know
[15073.44s -> 15075.92s]  I have no notifications on the stream.
[15076.00s -> 15079.28s]  So this might be difficult to do this.
[15079.28s -> 15079.76s]  Let's see.
[15080.88s -> 15082.88s]  I think it's still here.
[15086.95s -> 15087.43s]  Is it though?
[15090.29s -> 15091.25s]  Try Soul Calibur.
[15091.25s -> 15093.01s]  You know, I've heard here's the thing about Soul Calibur.
[15093.73s -> 15095.33s]  It's got a really great character creator
[15095.33s -> 15097.97s]  but I would get to the game, the actual
[15097.97s -> 15099.97s]  we'd make like five characters in Soul Calibur
[15100.77s -> 15103.65s]  and then I'd get to the video game and go,
[15106.44s -> 15107.32s]  I don't know about this.
[15108.04s -> 15112.90s]  But see you guys on Tuesday if you're taking off.
[15112.90s -> 15113.86s]  Thanks for sticking around.
[15113.86s -> 15121.25s]  Let me see if I can pull up the at least the bits.
[15121.25s -> 15121.65s]  Let's see.
[15126.87s -> 15128.07s]  Soul Calibur is great.
[15132.21s -> 15133.17s]  It's for PC, right?
[15133.89s -> 15135.40s]  Soul Calibur is PC.
[15136.12s -> 15140.82s]  But we do this once like every eight or nine months
[15140.82s -> 15143.86s]  once there's enough characters or new ideas
[15143.86s -> 15144.82s]  to put into a rumble.
[15145.62s -> 15147.38s]  So thank you so much everybody for sticking around.
[15149.99s -> 15153.43s]  I don't have any of the subs I don't think.
[15153.43s -> 15153.91s]  Let's see.
[15155.03s -> 15156.74s]  I'll run the credits either way.
[15157.38s -> 15160.42s]  Because I didn't have streamlabs going but it's okay.
[15161.54s -> 15163.91s]  No, actually, how the fuck did I delete it?
[15163.91s -> 15164.79s]  What the hell am I doing?
[15165.43s -> 15170.80s]  But people gave so much money tonight.
[15170.80s -> 15172.80s]  There was at least $50 from Nay.
[15173.36s -> 15174.24s]  From Nay means Nay.
[15174.24s -> 15175.28s]  Thanks for $50.
[15176.08s -> 15177.92s]  Stream is the best birthday present ever.
[15177.92s -> 15178.72s]  Thank you so much.
[15179.60s -> 15180.88s]  $10 from Riggle Rat.
[15181.44s -> 15182.40s]  They say Jax God.
[15182.40s -> 15184.24s]  $10 from Elizabeth.
[15184.24s -> 15185.12s]  I love you stuff so much.
[15185.12s -> 15186.64s]  Please take these bits.
[15186.64s -> 15187.04s]  Thank you.
[15193.70s -> 15194.26s]  OBS.
[15194.26s -> 15195.62s]  Make sure you get OBS Studio.
[15196.34s -> 15200.28s]  Thank you guys.
[15201.00s -> 15203.38s]  OBS Hijack.
[15204.71s -> 15208.72s]  On Tuesday we'll be live again.
[15209.52s -> 15211.89s]  Peaked at 9,000 viewers this stream.
[15211.89s -> 15212.61s]  Holy shit.
[15213.41s -> 15214.05s]  Are you kidding me?
[15215.73s -> 15219.60s]  I saw like eight.
[15220.48s -> 15221.04s]  God damn.
[15221.76s -> 15223.30s]  Thank you everybody.
[15223.86s -> 15224.88s]  Hope you had fun.
[15225.60s -> 15227.43s]  9,085.
[15228.82s -> 15229.30s]  Really?
[15229.30s -> 15230.18s]  Are you serious?
[15230.18s -> 15231.70s]  9,085.
[15232.42s -> 15233.67s]  Jesus Christ.
[15237.43s -> 15239.35s]  Well, if you that's a lot of new people.
[15239.35s -> 15240.71s]  If you're new, we'll hopefully see you again.
[15241.27s -> 15244.71s]  We try to do fun stuff like this on like a monthly basis.
[15244.71s -> 15247.91s]  So top WWE streamer.
[15253.36s -> 15255.89s]  But I think I'm going to end it here.
[15257.76s -> 15258.96s]  I've got to go take care of Otto.
[15259.76s -> 15262.32s]  He ran downstairs and I got to go let him out and feed him and shit.
[15262.32s -> 15262.80s]  I got to go.
[15268.24s -> 15269.28s]  You guys are fucking incredible.
[15269.28s -> 15271.92s]  Thank you everybody for subscribing, for giving money.
[15275.81s -> 15276.61s]  Thank you so much.
[15279.03s -> 15280.63s]  And I'll see you next weekend.
[15280.63s -> 15281.43s]  There's even more.
[15281.43s -> 15282.55s]  We're not fucking stopping.
[15282.55s -> 15284.63s]  The brakes don't we don't fucking hit the brakes anymore.
[15285.73s -> 15290.37s]  Next weekend is the movie night for the green screen.
[15291.27s -> 15292.55s]  That's going to be a fucking ton of fun.
[15294.31s -> 15297.91s]  I've seen some of the shit you guys have made so far and it's hilarious.
[15299.94s -> 15301.14s]  So that's next weekend.
[15301.14s -> 15302.58s]  Every fucking weekend we're doing something new.
[15305.32s -> 15311.80s]  Again, if you don't know, in the discord there is a channel called movie night.
[15311.80s -> 15312.92s]  There's a pinned message.
[15313.56s -> 15315.32s]  The video has to be uploaded to YouTube.
[15315.96s -> 15317.56s]  You can't just put it on like Reddit or something.
[15317.56s -> 15319.80s]  It's got to be a YouTube video, going to go to YouTube playlist.
[15320.68s -> 15328.36s]  It has to be there by next Thursday, 29th, Thursday or Friday.
[15329.99s -> 15330.63s]  Join the discord.
[15330.63s -> 15331.51s]  A lot of great people there.
[15334.28s -> 15335.56s]  And that's where I'm going to end it.
[15335.56s -> 15338.20s]  So I have my stream.
[15338.20s -> 15339.08s]  Unfortunately, I'm sorry.
[15339.08s -> 15344.52s]  I can't do the subs tonight and I got to go take care of the dog.
[15344.52s -> 15350.32s]  So all your subscriptions, all the money you guys gave the stream is fucking incredibly appreciated.
[15350.32s -> 15351.92s]  I can't believe people paid money to this stream,
[15352.64s -> 15356.42s]  but that's why I want to do stuff that's fun or at least I try.
[15357.80s -> 15360.44s]  If I, if I'm having fun, I hope you guys are too.
[15361.86s -> 15362.26s]  Cheers.
[15362.82s -> 15363.46s]  Much love to you.
[15363.46s -> 15364.34s]  See you guys on Tuesday.
[15366.02s -> 15366.82s]  Take care of yourselves.
[15367.62s -> 15385.60s]  Ta-ta for now.
