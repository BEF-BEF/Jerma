[37.37s -> 39.17s]  Hello, everyone. Hello.
[39.57s -> 42.65s]  Hi. He's alive.
[43.83s -> 46.79s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[51.15s -> 54.90s]  Welcome back. Been gone for a little while.
[57.09s -> 68.02s]  Been a little busy, but, you know, those of you that saw all the streamer awards was there in Los Angeles.
[69.02s -> 70.78s]  Ooh, he was in L.A.
[74.10s -> 78.26s]  I always feel like that's such a, I don't know, those of you that live in L.A.
[78.86s -> 83.02s]  You just live in L.A., but those of us that visit L.A., it's I went to L.A.
[83.50s -> 84.94s]  Yeah, I was in L.A.
[85.34s -> 86.46s]  Cool. Isn't that cool?
[87.34s -> 90.38s]  It's like a cool thing to go do for people that don't live there.
[93.03s -> 95.91s]  Every time you tell somebody you were in L.A., they go, really?
[97.10s -> 98.54s]  Los Angeles, California.
[99.34s -> 100.78s]  Yeah. Wow.
[101.94s -> 107.35s]  Really? No one lives there.
[108.88s -> 114.24s]  That would be weird considering it's one of the most populated cities in the entire country of the United States.
[115.08s -> 117.16s]  That'd be interesting. What you said is true.
[126.54s -> 128.30s]  But yeah, it was a great weekend.
[130.12s -> 134.16s]  Took a little bit of time. I probably will take a little bit more time, if I'm honest with you.
[135.32s -> 138.24s]  Not right now, obviously, but we'll go for the week.
[141.46s -> 143.66s]  Yeah, I'm just turning the stream on just to be like, hey, what's up?
[143.66s -> 147.04s]  And then I'm out of here. I'm kidding. Stop.
[148.47s -> 150.51s]  Please address the goblin picture.
[152.39s -> 154.23s]  I know there's a lot to address.
[161.13s -> 168.87s]  I kind of had one of those moments where with the thing picture and
[169.59s -> 171.11s]  it's like, no, that's not real.
[171.55s -> 173.75s]  That's not a real picture of a person.
[173.83s -> 175.03s]  That's not a picture of me.
[179.42s -> 180.10s]  But it is.
[183.17s -> 184.37s]  If you'd. All right.
[184.37s -> 189.29s]  Let's let me just talk about the close up Ren and Stimpy detailed spongebob picture.
[191.25s -> 194.01s]  Or, you know, I've seen a lot of people, I've seen a lot of takes on it.
[194.69s -> 205.61s]  The CEO rushing out of the courtroom with all the bodyguards trying to get into a limousine to avoid the interviews and the news cameras because of the scandal that they are involved in.
[206.79s -> 219.88s]  I've heard it all, seen many of them, but yeah, I don't take.
[219.88s -> 222.48s]  OK, you guys already know this.
[222.84s -> 225.16s]  I don't take good pictures.
[225.52s -> 227.64s]  I never have and I never will.
[228.52s -> 235.28s]  When a photo was taken of me, my face morphs into something else.
[235.28s -> 236.68s]  It's not even my face anymore.
[238.52s -> 240.76s]  Me on video versus me in pictures.
[241.66s -> 245.50s]  It's almost like it's two completely different people that I've never gotten it.
[245.50s -> 246.26s]  I mean, it doesn't make sense.
[250.58s -> 252.86s]  You can't take a picture because it's his true form.
[252.86s -> 254.98s]  He morphs. He doesn't want you to see his true form.
[254.98s -> 256.30s]  You're literally Bigfoot.
[262.74s -> 267.14s]  I have my face is really angular, too, like it just depends on what angle you take it from.
[267.14s -> 269.50s]  You got a bunch of flash in the face, right?
[270.56s -> 272.08s]  It's all good. I think it's funny that I'm here.
[281.94s -> 282.98s]  I have a pointy face.
[282.98s -> 284.14s]  Yeah, I kind of do.
[286.67s -> 289.67s]  It doesn't also help that I don't even know what I was.
[289.91s -> 291.39s]  It almost sounds like I'm leaning.
[291.83s -> 295.11s]  It looks like I'm leaning in, pointing at my ear.
[296.62s -> 298.46s]  Saying, could you say that again?
[299.26s -> 301.78s]  Like I didn't hear what the person said.
[301.78s -> 302.38s]  I don't know.
[306.26s -> 307.22s]  But yeah, it was a good day.
[307.38s -> 308.02s]  It was a good weekend.
[310.42s -> 314.22s]  That legacy award is something I honestly had no idea was happening.
[316.29s -> 323.19s]  It's kind of funny because I started to understand what was going on when the two
[323.19s -> 328.35s]  camera guys started leaning down in front of the table we were sitting at and like
[328.55s -> 332.35s]  rack focusing the camera directly in front of me, like on my face.
[332.95s -> 333.91s]  Like just right in front of me.
[333.91s -> 335.35s]  And I'm like, why is this person here?
[335.99s -> 340.75s]  This person is literally focusing like I can see them moving the dial and they're
[340.75s -> 342.39s]  right in front of me. Why are they here in front of me?
[348.34s -> 349.50s]  So it's really cool.
[349.50s -> 354.18s]  I don't, you know, obviously there's a lot of people in the streaming world and in
[354.18s -> 357.86s]  the content creation world that deserve that award.
[358.91s -> 361.71s]  I'm just surprised and shocked that it was me.
[362.15s -> 363.11s]  There's a lot of other people here.
[368.55s -> 370.71s]  I wish I could tell you more.
[371.03s -> 372.23s]  I wish I could say more.
[374.47s -> 380.35s]  But people have been incredibly nice to me, incredibly supportive to me for a decade.
[380.47s -> 386.53s]  More than that. And a lot of times I look at it and I kind of, I don't know, it's
[386.53s -> 387.61s]  like, do I deserve it?
[388.45s -> 391.77s]  I don't know. It's a weird feeling sometimes.
[394.42s -> 399.58s]  But I really do hope that whoever's here, whether you started watching 10 years ago,
[399.58s -> 401.94s]  12 years ago, or you found the channel a month ago.
[403.11s -> 405.62s]  Cool. I hope you'll like it.
[406.14s -> 407.14s]  That's all I care about.
[410.95s -> 414.59s]  Other streamers have come up and said a lot of really nice things that it was, it was
[414.59s -> 417.89s]  really, I just hope, I hope people like it.
[418.01s -> 418.81s]  That's all I care about.
[419.65s -> 424.58s]  And the thing about like other streamers, too, there's a lot of really, really funny
[424.58s -> 427.70s]  people, really, really interesting people that do this.
[428.63s -> 433.63s]  And I kind of want to make sure they understand that they are fucking awesome.
[434.45s -> 436.49s]  There's lots of really cool people in this space.
[438.21s -> 444.06s]  And although I don't get a lot of opportunity to tell them that, I hope I could this
[444.06s -> 469.17s]  past weekend. I met people that I watch that say things to me about like how I'm
[470.23s -> 474.84s]  awesome at what I do, but they are, too.
[477.31s -> 478.47s]  They really fucking are.
[488.10s -> 489.58s]  Dude, just cry already.
[489.62s -> 492.10s]  I knew when I turned this, I was waiting to turn the stream.
[492.10s -> 494.26s]  I was like, fuck, man, I'm going to talk about those that are going to cry.
[495.02s -> 502.14s]  No, I'm good. But yeah, I want to make people aware that there's a lot of other
[502.14s -> 504.74s]  people that do really interesting things, and I want them to know that, too.
[505.90s -> 509.46s]  Especially the people that I've watched that I have seen lots of their content before.
[510.46s -> 513.42s]  And it's funny because people are almost surprised when they hear that I've seen
[513.42s -> 514.26s]  some stuff that they do.
[515.26s -> 516.62s]  Like, wait, what? How?
[516.66s -> 518.10s]  You've never seen me. What are you talking about?
[519.02s -> 521.62s]  Yeah, I have. And what you do is fucking cool.
[529.06s -> 531.93s]  But anyways, it was a it was a great weekend.
[533.36s -> 535.12s]  He's always watching.
[541.64s -> 543.64s]  Tony said, you're the you do you guy.
[546.74s -> 547.66s]  But it's true.
[547.70s -> 551.78s]  There's a lot of people that should be recognized that are doing amazing things.
[562.26s -> 563.94s]  It's time for a staring contest.
[571.89s -> 573.37s]  Who is your successor?
[575.94s -> 577.42s]  There is no successor.
[577.42s -> 580.66s]  There are tons of people that are already doing their own thing very well.
[581.54s -> 583.22s]  Nobody has to succeed me.
[583.22s -> 584.66s]  I don't I don't like that.
[584.66s -> 587.66s]  It's that's weird. That's a weird thing to think about.
[591.32s -> 593.36s]  Yeah, I saw the Bill Clinton kid, too.
[593.40s -> 594.20s]  That was interesting.
[596.58s -> 597.94s]  At first, I didn't know what was going on.
[597.94s -> 599.54s]  I was really tired after the awards.
[600.66s -> 603.33s]  And I was just kind of like, you know,
[603.33s -> 607.73s]  had a couple of drinks and he kind of leaned in.
[607.73s -> 610.33s]  He was like, hey, he was trying to get me to talk into the camera.
[611.25s -> 613.85s]  And I think I was like, oh, yeah, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
[613.85s -> 616.13s]  and I'm going to get a massage.
[616.49s -> 618.01s]  I was just saying words.
[618.01s -> 621.48s]  I don't even know if they were.
[621.48s -> 630.69s]  I go to like fucking talking about
[630.69s -> 631.89s]  it was a vodka pineapple.
[631.89s -> 642.82s]  Yeah, Bansley interview.
[642.82s -> 644.06s]  That's right. I did.
[644.06s -> 646.62s]  I need to like think of other things to talk about
[646.62s -> 649.31s]  when I have nothing really to talk about.
[649.31s -> 652.15s]  You know, the drink of choice is a vodka pineapple.
[652.35s -> 653.47s]  Yeah, it's very clean.
[653.47s -> 655.63s]  It's like, is there anything else you could talk and the gorillas?
[656.07s -> 658.87s]  Oh, yeah. Plastic Beach is my favorite album.
[660.27s -> 662.02s]  OK, dude.
[662.02s -> 667.05s]  What else do you have anything else to say to anybody? Yeah.
[673.85s -> 676.61s]  We all have the things that we default to, I think.
[681.56s -> 683.76s]  Plastic Beach, really basic.
[685.23s -> 686.23s]  I like Plastic Beach.
[686.23s -> 688.33s]  I think Plastic Beach was hold on.
[688.33s -> 695.21s]  Don't say that easy.
[695.21s -> 700.73s]  I don't say that the Demon Days fans are going to be very upset with me.
[704.45s -> 708.05s]  I think they're both equally fantastic albums.
[713.06s -> 718.79s]  They go. Yeah, there's not too much more to say.
[718.79s -> 721.27s]  I'm just overwhelmed with the support that people give me.
[722.84s -> 726.54s]  And I just hope it's worth it.
[726.54s -> 729.61s]  I think about it every single day.
[729.61s -> 732.73s]  How to improve stuff, how to be funnier, better.
[734.74s -> 736.98s]  But I don't want to get too much in my own head, though,
[736.98s -> 739.62s]  because I think that's where you get into trouble.
[739.62s -> 742.14s]  Because I told you before that I got to be funnier.
[742.14s -> 743.70s]  I've got to be better. I've got to be faster.
[743.70s -> 744.82s]  I've got to be stronger.
[744.82s -> 747.34s]  I've got to. At some point, you end up flying into the sun.
[747.66s -> 749.31s]  And I don't want to do that.
[749.31s -> 752.11s]  Part of the reasons for telling you guys that this year was going to be
[752.31s -> 754.71s]  a little slower was because of that.
[758.74s -> 765.06s]  And then some. So, dude, just keep doing you.
[765.46s -> 768.62s]  Exactly. Exactly. You get it.
[772.86s -> 774.26s]  I mean it, though, I really do.
[774.26s -> 777.53s]  I really do. I promise you do.
[777.53s -> 787.75s]  That's hey, I'm telling you, it's true.
[787.75s -> 790.27s]  There's been people that have been here for a decade.
[790.27s -> 793.49s]  And I don't know.
[793.49s -> 796.27s]  It's hard to put into words, overwhelming.
[796.27s -> 797.71s]  That's why I pull out a lot.
[797.71s -> 802.35s]  That's why I disconnect so often because I need to.
[804.25s -> 806.49s]  I don't want to get too overwhelmed that I end up.
[807.65s -> 810.41s]  All right. I pulled back from the Internet.
[810.41s -> 811.37s]  All right. That's what I was trying to say.
[811.37s -> 814.41s]  I pull out from the Internet.
[814.45s -> 815.77s]  I can't. Come on. Come on.
[815.77s -> 821.14s]  Come on. Excuse me.
[821.14s -> 821.98s]  Cry on camera.
[821.98s -> 826.16s]  What if I turn the camera on was bawling for 10 straight minutes?
[832.46s -> 837.06s]  What people think that would be weird.
[837.06s -> 840.62s]  And I just I like have the I'm holding the trophy.
[841.34s -> 843.02s]  I'm holding the award.
[843.02s -> 844.30s]  It's just crying.
[844.30s -> 846.42s]  What if that's how I started this stream?
[846.42s -> 849.50s]  And then I moved on after about 20 straight minutes.
[851.15s -> 853.15s]  And then I get like I get like I look at it.
[853.15s -> 856.34s]  I like start to look at the reflection in it and stuff.
[856.34s -> 858.46s]  And I just sit there and I turn it so you can see me looking
[858.46s -> 864.66s]  in the reflection into the metal.
[864.66s -> 866.34s]  Would people leave the chance?
[866.34s -> 867.06s]  Would you leave?
[867.06s -> 868.74s]  Would you be like, all right, this is fucking weird.
[868.74s -> 871.22s]  I'm leaving this. This guy's a weirdo.
[871.74s -> 875.42s]  I don't want to really be here anymore.
[875.42s -> 879.18s]  How long into the 20 minute cry with the award in my hands
[879.38s -> 890.55s]  that before you leave this stream for hours?
[891.11s -> 894.47s]  My God. All right.
[894.47s -> 894.99s]  We can move on.
[894.99s -> 897.43s]  I just wanted to talk a little bit briefly about the streamer awards.
[897.47s -> 899.67s]  There's a lot of awesome people in this industry.
[899.71s -> 901.79s]  And I like telling people that
[902.59s -> 905.76s]  because I genuinely watch a lot of different people.
[905.76s -> 909.92s]  And I'm shocked that this many people think that I'm cool enough to
[910.04s -> 913.08s]  or nice enough or interesting enough to even just decide
[913.08s -> 915.20s]  that that's something that I should have received.
[915.20s -> 916.64s]  Shocked. I'm floored.
[916.64s -> 918.52s]  And thank you, everybody that's been here for this long.
[918.52s -> 920.68s]  Even if you don't like it, even if you fucking came here
[920.68s -> 923.76s]  and you're like, this guy sucks, this guy's not funny.
[923.76s -> 925.68s]  Thanks for checking me out in the first place.
[925.68s -> 930.80s]  I appreciate it. Thank you.
[930.84s -> 932.84s]  So now we're going to play Diablo 4 if we can
[933.04s -> 941.40s]  and not get booted in 10 minutes from the server.
[941.40s -> 943.92s]  We have a contingency plan.
[943.92s -> 948.46s]  If Diablo 4 does not work, if I get booted and can't play it,
[949.98s -> 951.78s]  some of you are going to be really excited over this.
[951.78s -> 953.86s]  And I don't even know if I want to say it,
[953.86s -> 956.26s]  because I feel like it's going to derail the entire stream.
[956.86s -> 960.13s]  And I'm just going to play D4.
[960.13s -> 964.41s]  But I do have to tell you about the contingency plan.
[964.41s -> 967.41s]  If we do get booted and there's like a 60 minute wait time,
[967.41s -> 970.13s]  I'm going to go back into the queue
[970.13s -> 971.93s]  and we're going to play Nancy Drew,
[971.93s -> 977.77s]  Mystery of the Icicle Wolf in between in the downtime.
[987.90s -> 989.98s]  By the way, I don't even know if I can capture that game.
[989.98s -> 992.30s]  I tried to three or four times and it was kind of a mess,
[992.30s -> 994.18s]  but I got it to work very briefly.
[994.18s -> 996.26s]  So we'll see if it works.
[996.26s -> 998.58s]  We're going to hit downtime in the Diablo 4 server,
[999.02s -> 1002.22s]  and it's going to take me 40 minutes to capture this Nancy Drew game.
[1003.18s -> 1005.86s]  So it might not even be worth it at all.
[1005.86s -> 1008.06s]  We're also going to talk about Grotto Beast a little bit later.
[1008.62s -> 1013.04s]  There's a couple of little things to kind of show you
[1013.04s -> 1015.49s]  or to let you know exist,
[1015.49s -> 1017.53s]  some stuff that something people have been waiting for.
[1017.53s -> 1020.42s]  So that's cool.
[1020.42s -> 1021.38s]  And I think it's time to play.
[1021.38s -> 1024.06s]  This is I don't want to say I'm excited for Diablo 4
[1024.06s -> 1026.54s]  because I told you a week or two ago when this was a thing
[1027.64s -> 1031.44s]  that I don't want to be excited for this because I refuse to be excited
[1031.44s -> 1035.80s]  over a game like this because my entire life revolved around Diablo 2.
[1036.94s -> 1041.44s]  And Diablo 3 was like, eh, is that right?
[1042.62s -> 1045.26s]  They made a bunch of improvements to it over the years,
[1045.26s -> 1047.42s]  but it just wasn't it.
[1049.89s -> 1053.05s]  Diablo Immortal came out, thought it was awful.
[1056.12s -> 1058.64s]  So Diablo 4 comes out awful.
[1059.54s -> 1061.58s]  So let I'm just I have zero.
[1061.58s -> 1066.78s]  We're going in with zero expectations. Zero.
[1066.78s -> 1069.58s]  I'm here we are.
[1069.58s -> 1073.86s]  OK, ready? Character creator.
[1073.86s -> 1075.78s]  I wanted to make sure I was in the game,
[1075.78s -> 1077.66s]  so I had to kind of get into the character creator
[1077.66s -> 1080.10s]  because there was a 70 plus minute wait to get in here.
[1081.43s -> 1086.74s]  I wanted to name the character internal temp, 145 degrees.
[1088.53s -> 1090.69s]  But as like, oh, yeah, like a fire character.
[1090.69s -> 1093.63s]  I don't know. I mean, this is Sorceress.
[1093.63s -> 1095.63s]  We're just going to go with internal temp.
[1095.63s -> 1097.27s]  We've probably already seen the cut scene before.
[1097.27s -> 1098.19s]  You've probably already seen it.
[1098.19s -> 1101.11s]  If you haven't, then I mean, this is probably on YouTube.
[1104.38s -> 1106.70s]  145 degrees. That's that's meat, right?
[1107.06s -> 1109.06s]  Internal temperature of 145.
[1109.06s -> 1111.62s]  Is that accurate? Or is that 160, 165?
[1114.86s -> 1116.06s]  Give him a real name.
[1116.06s -> 1116.98s]  It's the best.
[1116.98s -> 1119.78s]  This character is going to get deleted probably in three days.
[1120.06s -> 1123.98s]  What do you mean? It needs to be a real name.
[1123.98s -> 1126.46s]  This guy is getting deleted, probably.
[1127.68s -> 1130.63s]  It's 145, isn't it? All right, let's go.
[1130.91s -> 1133.07s]  I am not excited.
[1133.59s -> 1135.76s]  Don't get excited ever.
[1135.76s -> 1137.76s]  Just let's start at zero. Here we go.
[1137.76s -> 1145.90s]  You ready? I mean, it's this one, right?
[1146.65s -> 1148.14s]  World tier.
[1148.14s -> 1149.58s]  This may be changing anytime for the characters.
[1149.58s -> 1151.98s]  So, OK, this is like normal nightmare hell.
[1152.14s -> 1156.45s]  Imagining enemies are more challenging, more experience.
[1156.45s -> 1159.20s]  I mean, we're doing this one.
[1159.20s -> 1162.59s]  Hey, here we go.
[1162.59s -> 1174.71s]  I'm not. I don't get excited.
[1174.71s -> 1179.39s]  Come on. Sanctuary was never meant for humankind.
[1179.43s -> 1180.79s]  It's all right. I'm not.
[1180.79s -> 1183.91s]  It was forged as a refuge from the war
[1185.48s -> 1188.02s]  and the burning hells.
[1188.02s -> 1193.40s]  Instead, it became a new battleground in this eternal conflict.
[1194.62s -> 1199.94s]  A secretive group called the Haradrim has kept mortal safe.
[1201.23s -> 1205.75s]  But now this once powerful order is a husk of what it was.
[1206.75s -> 1209.87s]  And centuries, ancient creators have returned
[1210.31s -> 1213.35s]  to claim the hearts of humankind. All right.
[1215.18s -> 1218.38s]  This is the story of their downfall.
[1232.65s -> 1233.85s]  It's Decker Cane in this game.
[1233.85s -> 1251.45s]  Tell me it's Decker Cane in the game.
[1251.45s -> 1253.53s]  I just jump scared to shitload of people.
[1253.53s -> 1264.72s]  I'm sorry. Well, it's a cut scene.
[1264.72s -> 1268.62s]  What am I even doing here?
[1268.62s -> 1271.90s]  Decker Cane. If you didn't play Diablo 3, let me tell you something.
[1271.90s -> 1274.98s]  Decker Cane. Something happens to him in the third game.
[1278.09s -> 1285.21s]  Oh, that's me.
[1285.45s -> 1287.57s]  That's not my computer.
[1289.70s -> 1291.94s]  I thought I was telling me my computer was overheating.
[1299.04s -> 1300.36s]  How did I forget that already?
[1300.36s -> 1302.84s]  I need to drink some fucking water. Jesus.
[1302.84s -> 1338.10s]  All right. What are the controls?
[1338.10s -> 1356.23s]  Oh, I am so excited. I don't even care.
[1356.39s -> 1358.95s]  If this game sucks or whatever, I'm here.
[1363.75s -> 1366.23s]  I just want to collect loot on the ground and have a go.
[1366.23s -> 1371.04s]  Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.
[1371.04s -> 1372.96s]  His internal temperature is way too low.
[1374.30s -> 1394.52s]  True. The only dialogue we've had this whole cut scene
[1394.52s -> 1396.56s]  has been gasping and heavy breathing.
[1399.12s -> 1404.37s]  Oh, I should find better shelter before I freeze.
[1405.62s -> 1411.76s]  OK, well, I'm going to give you my initial assessment here.
[1412.44s -> 1416.99s]  How far can I pull the camera out?
[1416.99s -> 1423.46s]  OK, melee range is very big.
[1425.91s -> 1433.82s]  Oh, a fine shelter in a nearby town.
[1433.82s -> 1438.90s]  OK, let's go. So I'm a I'm a sorcerer.
[1440.18s -> 1445.13s]  Melee range is not melee.
[1445.13s -> 1448.65s]  I guess. It's like a little.
[1449.85s -> 1453.33s]  What is this? Oh, it's just a that's just attack.
[1456.51s -> 1459.75s]  OK, you're going to do face cam.
[1459.75s -> 1462.43s]  I'm doing I'm only doing face cam for like the first 10 minutes.
[1463.95s -> 1465.67s]  It's just game viewership.
[1465.67s -> 1467.23s]  And then it's going off.
[1476.36s -> 1481.42s]  Oh, OK, I don't want to hold all.
[1481.42s -> 1484.74s]  All right, I'll tell you that my initial reactions to the one swing,
[1484.74s -> 1490.10s]  the few swings on enemies and stuff, I love it.
[1490.98s -> 1494.10s]  Well, hold on. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1494.10s -> 1496.30s]  That's a weird way to say that.
[1496.30s -> 1498.58s]  So one thing that they added in this game that I don't know if, you know,
[1498.58s -> 1500.94s]  you could turn it off in Diablo three.
[1500.94s -> 1503.02s]  You're probably noticing that every time I attack an enemy,
[1505.10s -> 1507.30s]  they don't light up like a Christmas tree.
[1509.51s -> 1513.35s]  I'm so glad that I can turn that off.
[1513.35s -> 1516.19s]  I don't know why we decided to put that in in games.
[1516.75s -> 1519.15s]  Like, let me I'm so glad I can just turn it off.
[1519.15s -> 1521.55s]  I hate that so much.
[1521.55s -> 1524.18s]  Everywhere, things in the dark.
[1525.67s -> 1527.35s]  Keep it on now.
[1527.35s -> 1528.59s]  And there's no screen shake either.
[1528.59s -> 1534.50s]  I turn that off, too. He's a wild one.
[1534.50s -> 1535.70s]  I said, is it too loud?
[1535.70s -> 1548.74s]  I think it's too loud.
[1548.74s -> 1551.22s]  What's going on here? What's it to you?
[1551.22s -> 1553.86s]  Also, and hush.
[1553.86s -> 1556.10s]  I'm sorry, Wanderer.
[1556.10s -> 1558.58s]  You've come at a difficult time.
[1559.59s -> 1563.23s]  This madman just stumbled into town and started causing trouble.
[1564.42s -> 1566.58s]  Demons spilling from the ruins.
[1567.06s -> 1568.18s]  Kill us all.
[1568.18s -> 1571.09s]  Interesting. Ruins.
[1572.01s -> 1575.31s]  What is he talking about?
[1575.31s -> 1577.23s]  Come, I'll explain.
[1577.23s -> 1579.63s]  Turn it up. It was OK.
[1579.63s -> 1583.65s]  OK, I'll put it a little higher.
[1583.65s -> 1585.57s]  There is evil staring in the room.
[1585.57s -> 1586.81s]  All right.
[1587.21s -> 1590.05s]  That poor monk back there must have gone inside.
[1591.40s -> 1593.32s]  In this game, it's like MMO.
[1593.32s -> 1597.64s]  I know it's like MMO, whatever he saw is like MMO internal temperature here.
[1597.64s -> 1604.49s]  Right.
[1604.49s -> 1606.85s]  Oh, wait, I'm going to slow down.
[1610.55s -> 1612.95s]  All right, that's the heel.
[1612.95s -> 1617.47s]  If Devmir is taking up all the space by the fire, just give him a shove.
[1620.46s -> 1622.82s]  What's that? You say something.
[1623.06s -> 1628.46s]  OK, fire is looking good, but I should watch it a little longer
[1629.42s -> 1632.14s]  to make sure it doesn't go out.
[1632.14s -> 1635.26s]  All right. Could you protect us from whatever is out there?
[1636.26s -> 1639.54s]  We have nowhere else to turn.
[1639.58s -> 1643.80s]  There is evil lurking in those ruins.
[1643.80s -> 1648.18s]  I will drag it into the light of day.
[1648.18s -> 1649.90s]  Oh, thank you.
[1649.90s -> 1651.94s]  Are you wearing a periodic periodic table?
[1659.32s -> 1664.18s]  Oh, this is this is embarrassing
[1664.18s -> 1669.18s]  because this is a periodic table of all the Star Wars characters that's ever existed.
[1672.78s -> 1675.14s]  I don't know why I own all these shirts.
[1676.82s -> 1678.74s]  I don't know why I have all these.
[1678.74s -> 1681.98s]  I think they were I think most of them were gifts.
[1691.98s -> 1693.94s]  That's a shirt for a 12 year old.
[1693.98s -> 1698.38s]  It's you know, maybe one day I'm going to give all these Star Wars shirts to somebody.
[1704.63s -> 1715.00s]  It's going to kill me.
[1715.00s -> 1717.72s]  Gold. Oh, it's heels.
[1717.72s -> 1723.34s]  OK, Q is an instant heel and then it's a heel over time.
[1723.34s -> 1728.41s]  That's interesting.
[1728.41s -> 1732.66s]  Didn't I level up? Hold on.
[1732.66s -> 1738.35s]  I leveled up, didn't I?
[1738.35s -> 1741.23s]  I want to compare. Oh, I don't have gloves on.
[1741.23s -> 1749.11s]  All right. Abilities on Earth.
[1749.11s -> 1751.82s]  OK, hold on a second.
[1751.82s -> 1752.86s]  So this is the skill tree.
[1752.86s -> 1755.50s]  I guess I have not looked at anything of this game.
[1756.26s -> 1758.34s]  I know absolutely nothing.
[1758.34s -> 1761.90s]  I saw like two or three little videos just kind of describing the game as it
[1762.82s -> 1765.42s]  sort of turned into what it is today.
[1765.42s -> 1769.58s]  But I've deliberately avoided almost everything.
[1769.58s -> 1771.46s]  So it looks like it's a big.
[1771.46s -> 1774.70s]  So you start up here and then you can go down this way and then this way
[1775.22s -> 1778.34s]  and then this way and then this way and then this way and then this down here.
[1778.34s -> 1782.43s]  OK, well, what can I do? Spark.
[1784.14s -> 1786.66s]  Is that what I have right now? No.
[1786.66s -> 1789.54s]  Launch a bolt of lightning that shocks an enemy four times.
[1790.94s -> 1796.41s]  Frostbolt. Oh, firebolt.
[1796.69s -> 1798.77s]  It's kind of like the character's name is internal temp.
[1798.77s -> 1804.78s]  It makes sense for me to have this flaming and it's a burn and Arc Lash.
[1804.90s -> 1807.67s]  What do you think? Should I go? Let us pick.
[1807.67s -> 1810.31s]  OK, what do I do? Let us choose. Yeah, that's fine.
[1812.08s -> 1814.92s]  Thematically, it does kind of have to be firebolt, but I'll let you decide.
[1816.12s -> 1819.72s]  Spark, frostbolt, firebolt or Arc Lash.
[1819.72s -> 1823.04s]  Let's go pull up two minutes less than two minutes.
[1824.74s -> 1827.30s]  Unleash arcing lightning that does 13 damage to enemies in front of you.
[1827.30s -> 1830.66s]  Every 10 times Arc Lash swipes, it stuns all enemies.
[1830.70s -> 1843.53s]  Why does it seem like the best thing here?
[1843.53s -> 1846.06s]  It is the best one. Yeah, but do we want to?
[1846.06s -> 1846.94s]  I don't want to do the thing.
[1846.94s -> 1849.02s]  Wait a minute. I might veto this.
[1849.02s -> 1852.54s]  Does every sorceress that you've seen on Twitch pick this?
[1852.54s -> 1854.58s]  Because I want to I don't know, I want to do something different.
[1854.58s -> 1864.97s]  Enhanced spark, percent crit strike.
[1871.05s -> 1873.21s]  You're going to make the worst character.
[1873.21s -> 1874.77s]  Why are you such a hipster?
[1874.77s -> 1875.93s]  I'm not. I just don't know.
[1875.93s -> 1878.01s]  It's a beta. I want to be able to showcase the other stuff.
[1883.38s -> 1885.35s]  What about down here?
[1885.43s -> 1890.96s]  Incinerate. Are these out of five or are these just three points?
[1892.54s -> 1895.14s]  So what it would be would be eight points to max it out.
[1898.53s -> 1900.31s]  Those are one. OK.
[1900.31s -> 1902.79s]  What is the cap? 50 level 50 is the cap.
[1902.79s -> 1909.12s]  So you realistically, realistically, you really only could be able to add level 50.
[1912.81s -> 1915.61s]  Only get a handful of these, right?
[1915.61s -> 1918.25s]  Interesting. OK, so you really have to kind of decide.
[1919.13s -> 1921.82s]  We want fire. What is it at right now?
[1921.82s -> 1923.26s]  All right, we'll go with fire.
[1923.26s -> 1925.06s]  That's what I would have picked anyways.
[1925.06s -> 1927.58s]  All right. Fire bolt.
[1927.58s -> 1931.30s]  Here it is. Oh, so this is now here, but I want it here.
[1932.18s -> 1933.22s]  Oh, it's locked.
[1936.01s -> 1938.55s]  Oh, how much man it is to use.
[1950.17s -> 1956.45s]  Oh, yeah. So Nancy Drew is a game that we're going to be checking out today.
[1956.45s -> 1960.09s]  Diablo four happens to be not functioning that as we have intended.
[1961.01s -> 1965.49s]  Nancy Drew is going to be the game that we are going to be taking a look at today.
[1969.30s -> 1971.02s]  God damn it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1971.02s -> 1973.55s]  Hold on. I think I'm still in.
[1973.55s -> 1974.75s]  Am I still good?
[1974.75s -> 1976.27s]  Wait, I think I'm still good.
[1976.27s -> 1985.84s]  Shit, I really wanted to play Diablo four.
[1997.33s -> 2002.14s]  What does that mean? Just restart the game.
[2002.14s -> 2007.68s]  OK. Well, we start restart the game.
[2007.68s -> 2010.92s]  Won't I have to go back into the queue for like a fucking hour?
[2018.15s -> 2025.47s]  Don't restart, people saying.
[2025.47s -> 2028.31s]  I unlocked one move and I know I can't play anymore.
[2033.62s -> 2040.02s]  Shit. It says restart.
[2040.02s -> 2048.91s]  You need to restart. You're playing day one.
[2050.32s -> 2054.44s]  Well, I mean, day one of two days for a beta.
[2055.54s -> 2065.42s]  It's not it's day one of two or three days, one of three.
[2065.94s -> 2071.16s]  OK, I'm going to just restart it and see how long it takes to get back in.
[2071.16s -> 2079.39s]  And then I'm going to play Nancy Drew three days next weekend.
[2079.47s -> 2086.83s]  Yeah, it's still all right. Let's try it.
[2087.78s -> 2092.67s]  I'm hoping for like less than five minutes.
[2092.67s -> 2099.06s]  I was just getting good.
[2099.06s -> 2102.62s]  That felt like it felt good from what I was walking around.
[2106.03s -> 2107.23s]  All right. What's what's the queue?
[2107.23s -> 2111.79s]  Oh, we got a queue of only nine minutes.
[2118.09s -> 2133.14s]  Let's open up Nancy Drew.
[2133.14s -> 2151.46s]  Why does it just get it open?
[2151.46s -> 2153.66s]  Here's one big problem.
[2153.66s -> 2159.99s]  This game was made in like out of like 1996 or something.
[2161.71s -> 2164.27s]  So I don't even know if I can see this.
[2164.59s -> 2167.71s]  Since you can tell a lot about a person by where he or she lives,
[2167.71s -> 2170.23s]  I thought I'd introduce myself by showing you my room.
[2170.55s -> 2172.83s]  As you can see, I keep it pretty neat.
[2172.83s -> 2174.99s]  Of course, I don't spend that much time in here.
[2174.99s -> 2176.59s]  I always seem to be off solving.
[2176.59s -> 2179.99s]  No, anyway, here's yes, you can.
[2179.99s -> 2181.19s]  Don't lie to me right now.
[2181.19s -> 2183.99s]  I can't all tab. Don't lie. Stop lying.
[2185.61s -> 2187.93s]  My desk. Go ahead and poke around.
[2188.29s -> 2191.05s]  If you want to know the particulars of how I do what I do,
[2191.29s -> 2193.97s]  take a look at the book titled How to Be a Detective.
[2194.29s -> 2197.45s]  It's real helpful, especially if you're new to the mystery solving.
[2197.45s -> 2200.45s]  This is Nancy Drew and the check out my scrap history
[2200.93s -> 2207.17s]  and the mystery of the wolf in the icicle cave or something.
[2207.37s -> 2212.58s]  I don't say anything about it.
[2212.58s -> 2214.78s]  And I said, head to the Icicle Creek Lodge,
[2214.78s -> 2217.82s]  a small guest lodge deep in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta, Canada,
[2218.18s -> 2220.42s]  and try to figure out why so many accidents have been happening there.
[2221.74s -> 2224.98s]  The woman who runs the lodge, Chantal Mowee,
[2225.30s -> 2229.94s]  he called me out the blue, saying the bed and I can't even read
[2230.06s -> 2234.90s]  fucking English words from Shadow Ranch and it's recommended.
[2234.90s -> 2237.26s]  I'm so flustered right now.
[2237.26s -> 2239.86s]  You sound so desperate that I couldn't refuse.
[2240.02s -> 2242.66s]  It's something with the way the words are blurry and I can't read them.
[2243.30s -> 2247.10s]  She said she was on her way to Edmonton to meet with her lawyers.
[2247.42s -> 2250.90s]  So her handyman, Ollie Randall, will pick me up at the airport.
[2251.78s -> 2254.58s]  She told me it's been really cold and snowy there
[2254.98s -> 2256.70s]  that I should pack accordingly.
[2256.70s -> 2258.58s]  And then she said something about a wolf.
[2258.58s -> 2260.86s]  The connection was getting really bad and I could barely hear her.
[2261.34s -> 2264.38s]  But I'm pretty sure she used the word prowling or was it howling
[2264.70s -> 2267.02s]  along with dangerous and be careful.
[2267.26s -> 2272.07s]  Couldn't you have just said she told me to be careful of the howling
[2272.07s -> 2272.95s]  and it might be dangerous?
[2272.95s -> 2278.50s]  Why do you have to do all this weird prowling, howling, dangerous and be careful?
[2278.94s -> 2280.94s]  She just said one sentence to you.
[2280.94s -> 2284.97s]  Like, why do you have to break it up like this?
[2284.97s -> 2287.65s]  OK, but wild animals, I hope I know what I'm getting into.
[2289.27s -> 2291.68s]  OK, how do I do it?
[2291.68s -> 2294.14s]  I just fucking exit to the goddamn game.
[2294.14s -> 2302.23s]  I didn't thank God. OK.
[2302.23s -> 2308.56s]  Oh, there it is.
[2308.56s -> 2316.45s]  So get on the plane.
[2316.45s -> 2318.45s]  The junior level provides a lot of help and hints.
[2318.45s -> 2321.77s]  Most more experienced players may enjoy playing the senior level.
[2327.42s -> 2329.74s]  I don't want to click this because it makes me feel old.
[2330.06s -> 2333.26s]  I don't want to click this because it's going to be like two plus two equals four.
[2340.46s -> 2342.70s]  When Chantal told me you were just a young thing,
[2342.70s -> 2344.50s]  well, I thought she was pulling my leg.
[2344.50s -> 2346.62s]  But you're not much older than my little girl, Freddy.
[2347.26s -> 2350.58s]  Well, if one of the people at the lodge is to blame for all those accidents,
[2350.62s -> 2354.26s]  Chantal thinks somebody like me has a better chance of figuring out who it is
[2354.26s -> 2356.62s]  and somebody more, you know, hard nosed.
[2357.42s -> 2360.14s]  Chantal has a bad habit of making up her mind
[2360.14s -> 2362.22s]  without thinking things clear through.
[2362.22s -> 2363.99s]  No need for you to tell her.
[2363.99s -> 2365.51s]  Look at the road, dude.
[2365.51s -> 2367.23s]  Is she still in Edmonton?
[2367.23s -> 2368.39s]  Afraid so.
[2368.39s -> 2371.63s]  Insurance companies given her and her lawyers a real hard time.
[2371.99s -> 2375.71s]  Left running the lodge up to me, which is why I'm not real crazy.
[2375.71s -> 2377.03s]  Oh, my God.
[2377.03s -> 2380.15s]  I knew underfoot, especially if something else happens.
[2380.63s -> 2382.19s]  I won't be underfoot, Mr.
[2382.19s -> 2386.27s]  Randall, and I may be young, but I'm no novice when it comes to solving.
[2386.27s -> 2390.07s]  I'm sorry if you look over at somebody in the pastor's seat.
[2390.71s -> 2397.07s]  One, two, three, or it's that's the car spinning.
[2407.44s -> 2412.64s]  What actually happened there?
[2412.64s -> 2413.76s]  No, ma'am.
[2413.76s -> 2415.84s]  Everyone here at the lodge is accounted for.
[2427.50s -> 2429.94s]  He said he'd know more after the lab was done running tests
[2429.94s -> 2431.50s]  on the debris he collected.
[2431.50s -> 2433.86s]  He did say the blast was pretty powerful.
[2433.94s -> 2437.98s]  And he slide up to the back door, clear out on the highway.
[2445.02s -> 2447.46s]  You sure you don't want to give your daddy a call?
[2464.62s -> 2467.62s]  Well, I was thinking that maybe I'd just be your new maid.
[2470.92s -> 2473.08s]  How's the audio give me access to everyone's room?
[2473.08s -> 2476.16s]  And I could question people without making them overly suspicious.
[2485.77s -> 2487.85s]  The phone's not connected to anything.
[2487.85s -> 2518.81s]  I think that's a fine idea, ma'am.
[2518.81s -> 2521.89s]  I'm going to be pretty busy trying to get rid of that wolf, Chantal.
[2522.45s -> 2526.09s]  We heard it. How that sounds like stir doing one of his voices.
[2527.87s -> 2528.87s]  Everybody all right?
[2551.34s -> 2554.86s]  OK, I'll get you a master key and leave it in your room.
[2555.42s -> 2557.66s]  If you need anything else, I'll be in the basement.
[2557.74s -> 2560.86s]  It's stir's wolf voice from when we played that game.
[2561.26s -> 2568.68s]  The only thing I can hear. OK, mystery.
[2568.88s -> 2572.56s]  What's this key?
[2572.56s -> 2576.12s]  What's this? What's that? What's this?
[2576.12s -> 2579.02s]  What's that? What's this?
[2579.02s -> 2580.58s]  What's in there? What's that?
[2580.58s -> 2582.50s]  What is this? What's this thing? What's that?
[2583.34s -> 2584.54s]  What's that? There's a key inside of that.
[2584.54s -> 2585.42s]  Open that key here.
[2585.42s -> 2586.38s]  This must be the key.
[2586.38s -> 2589.08s]  All he said, he'd leave for me.
[2589.08s -> 2591.88s]  And this must be a list of which guest is in what room.
[2592.08s -> 2595.52s]  That'll come in handy.
[2595.52s -> 2603.57s]  OK. All right, we got a clock here.
[2604.33s -> 2607.73s]  Nine. If I can read it, it's nine fifteen.
[2609.49s -> 2611.33s]  We don't have any information for this yet.
[2611.33s -> 2618.93s]  What's this? Daily cleaning, pick up laundry bag at the front desk.
[2620.62s -> 2623.14s]  Available after five forty five a.m.
[2623.14s -> 2626.22s]  Enter and clean only those rooms displaying the housekeeping sign.
[2626.26s -> 2630.45s]  Make the bed. Wait, I actually I actually have to do it.
[2632.53s -> 2634.13s]  I thought I was just pretending to be the maid.
[2634.13s -> 2635.73s]  I don't actually have to do this, do I?
[2635.73s -> 2640.02s]  Skating pond maintenance.
[2640.02s -> 2643.34s]  Do you want me to be doing a little bit of everything while I'm here?
[2645.32s -> 2649.91s]  I thought that I was just
[2649.91s -> 2652.39s]  I thought part of this routine was I was going to pretend to be the maid
[2652.39s -> 2654.68s]  so I could go in and question people.
[2654.68s -> 2656.98s]  All right, whatever. OK.
[2656.98s -> 2659.30s]  On must be shoveled out after every snowfall.
[2660.21s -> 2663.69s]  Some sections of ice would be very thin due to hot spring activity.
[2664.01s -> 2665.93s]  Pay close attention to the color of the ice
[2666.41s -> 2669.45s]  and only shovel off those areas which are safe to skate on.
[2670.66s -> 2673.46s]  The shade of the ice will reveal how many adjacent ice grids
[2674.00s -> 2676.39s]  have dangerously thin ice.
[2676.39s -> 2678.59s]  Mark these areas with an orange safety cone.
[2679.33s -> 2683.97s]  OK, so we don't want to. This is bad.
[2683.97s -> 2686.65s]  So at what point is it safe to skate on?
[2686.65s -> 2691.60s]  Oh, my goodness.
[2691.60s -> 2694.44s]  Diablo is still
[2694.44s -> 2696.00s]  I have authentication pending.
[2696.00s -> 2703.48s]  I don't think we're getting that anytime soon.
[2703.48s -> 2706.84s]  This color means that there are three patches of its minesweeper.
[2709.00s -> 2713.80s]  Report all avalanches to the Avalanche Patrol.
[2717.15s -> 2722.00s]  Do not make loud noises when in the backcountry where snow shoes.
[2724.17s -> 2725.93s]  Can you imagine if this is what a clock sounded like?
[2725.93s -> 2729.09s]  This thing would be smashed in a second if it was near me for more than a minute.
[2733.94s -> 2737.30s]  Report any criminal activity.
[2737.30s -> 2741.07s]  OK, I can't even think when that's in my ears.
[2741.70s -> 2743.42s]  Employees should remember that heat and moisture
[2743.42s -> 2746.09s]  sometimes cause the door to the side of the stick.
[2746.09s -> 2750.73s]  Check to make sure. Is this giving me all the solutions to the puzzles?
[2752.84s -> 2758.06s]  This is puzzle solutions.
[2758.06s -> 2760.10s]  Breakfast is served from seven to eight.
[2760.10s -> 2762.50s]  Lunch from noon to one. Dinner from six to seven.
[2763.49s -> 2784.01s]  OK, I think I just crashed my computer.
[2806.93s -> 2828.01s]  All right. Oh, no, this is very loud now.
[2832.10s -> 2834.10s]  Oh, don't worry, guys, I'm going to kill three more skeletons
[2834.10s -> 2844.29s]  and we'll play Nancy Drew again.
[2844.29s -> 2846.76s]  Ocean Chargers, that's right.
[2846.76s -> 2854.51s]  OK, you can only have up to four. Got it.
[2855.15s -> 2858.27s]  Let's check over here. What is A?
[2858.27s -> 2860.94s]  Oh, right, right, right, right.
[2860.98s -> 2867.02s]  Whoa, guys, Nancy Drew is still open in the background.
[2867.66s -> 2871.81s]  That clock is ticking into Nancy Drew's AI brain
[2872.45s -> 2875.30s]  and she just has to sit there.
[2875.30s -> 2879.31s]  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
[2879.31s -> 2880.99s]  It's still open. Oh, don't worry, it's open.
[2880.99s -> 2883.19s]  I'm making sure I'm prepared now.
[2885.26s -> 2888.36s]  Um, I think I'm just going to do that one in here.
[2888.36s -> 2892.58s]  Yeah. How many points to get? Oh, I already can.
[2893.66s -> 2895.90s]  All right. I think I'm going to be a weirdo and just do this five times.
[2904.34s -> 2911.13s]  Doesn't Nancy Drew have a day night cycle?
[2911.13s -> 2914.33s]  I'm going to laugh my ass off if we go back over there.
[2914.69s -> 2919.01s]  It's like 12 days have passed.
[2919.01s -> 2923.54s]  Just staring at the clock.
[2923.54s -> 2926.26s]  What a miserable fucking life Nancy Drew has right now.
[2926.94s -> 2932.36s]  I'm so sorry, Nancy.
[2932.36s -> 2944.20s]  He's better. Yeah, he's stuck in purgatory.
[2946.56s -> 2950.87s]  Actually, it is kind of loud, isn't it?
[2950.87s -> 2960.49s]  Just a little, just a little bit, just a little chest.
[2961.49s -> 2966.54s]  Oh, uniques.
[2966.54s -> 2968.78s]  OK, so search the depths of Icehowl Ruins.
[2969.18s -> 2970.66s]  The games are blending together for me.
[2970.66s -> 2971.90s]  I feel like I'm in Nancy Drew.
[2971.90s -> 2974.98s]  I feel like I am Nancy Drew right now.
[2974.98s -> 2977.22s]  Icehowl Wolf. Icy.
[2977.22s -> 2983.19s]  It's like the same thing.
[2983.19s -> 2986.31s]  Guys, just pretend that we went to go investigate the wolf.
[2998.20s -> 3002.40s]  It does feel pretty fun to play so far, but let's not say that yet.
[3004.27s -> 3007.58s]  The first 10 minutes of Diablo 3 were fun, too.
[3008.30s -> 3010.94s]  Were they? Yeah, they were.
[3010.94s -> 3012.70s]  I would be lying if I didn't say that they weren't.
[3023.61s -> 3027.61s]  It definitely feels a little slower than D3,
[3029.18s -> 3048.50s]  which is a good thing.
[3049.66s -> 3054.12s]  They really took it in a new direction.
[3056.10s -> 3059.18s]  It's like a dodge roll.
[3059.18s -> 3061.06s]  Oh, shit, hold on. It's like a.
[3066.10s -> 3067.06s]  What?
[3068.82s -> 3081.23s]  Deep demons.
[3081.23s -> 3084.26s]  Oh, that original sound.
[3084.26s -> 3085.42s]  Wait, I want to check over here.
[3085.42s -> 3106.22s]  Skeleton captain with the loot, with the items.
[3110.26s -> 3112.54s]  This is pretty much a Roblox gameplay.
[3112.54s -> 3114.70s]  It is not Roblox gameplay.
[3125.47s -> 3127.82s]  Actually, just take it.
[3127.82s -> 3133.19s]  So true.
[3133.19s -> 3139.70s]  Shit. OK, hold on.
[3139.70s -> 3141.63s]  I do like the fire.
[3141.63s -> 3144.49s]  I need time.
[3145.29s -> 3147.01s]  Yeah. How much time?
[3147.01s -> 3151.06s]  Oh, it's five seconds. OK.
[3151.06s -> 3157.69s]  Yeah, I need some splash damage or something.
[3167.30s -> 3171.98s]  Oh, shit. First blue ever in D4.
[3176.16s -> 3177.36s]  So what is the itemization like?
[3177.36s -> 3179.73s]  What does it look like?
[3179.73s -> 3182.90s]  Thirty six armor, four decks.
[3182.90s -> 3191.56s]  OK, he's better than I have item power.
[3192.94s -> 3196.86s]  OK, take arc last year.
[3196.86s -> 3198.70s]  Mo should help with mobs.
[3200.96s -> 3213.23s]  Hold on a second here.
[3213.23s -> 3215.27s]  I have a lot of choices here now.
[3220.03s -> 3222.90s]  Incinerate. This is a flamethrower.
[3234.28s -> 3235.88s]  This is kind of better than this.
[3235.88s -> 3237.96s]  But this is a this is a damage on it.
[3237.96s -> 3243.64s]  Refund fireball is better than fireball.
[3243.64s -> 3247.64s]  I think firebolt maybe with the damage over time is good.
[3249.99s -> 3251.39s]  Is Nancy all right?
[3251.39s -> 3255.85s]  I think this is all right.
[3255.85s -> 3258.76s]  Don't stack bolt.
[3258.76s -> 3261.06s]  So this is 19.
[3261.06s -> 3266.67s]  This is 17 and 14 of it is over eight seconds.
[3269.46s -> 3270.78s]  So I definitely want to go for.
[3270.78s -> 3271.66s]  Wait, what about the other ones?
[3271.66s -> 3276.51s]  Frozen orb? No, I don't think so.
[3276.51s -> 3278.43s]  That's not bad. I don't need it right now, though.
[3278.43s -> 3280.67s]  All right, we'll go fireball.
[3280.67s -> 3286.04s]  And then should I refund this?
[3286.04s -> 3291.23s]  I don't think I can.
[3291.23s -> 3293.99s]  So now I can go, but it probably costs a lot of mana, though.
[3295.69s -> 3296.89s]  All right. That's why you do.
[3296.89s -> 3298.25s]  I get it. All right. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[3298.25s -> 3299.21s]  Let's go.
[3300.89s -> 3311.17s]  Yeah. Only if you have no mana.
[3311.17s -> 3316.09s]  Yep. It's a good way to put it.
[3316.09s -> 3322.38s]  Yes, yeah. All right.
[3322.38s -> 3325.26s]  I understand. I get the rotation.
[3325.26s -> 3330.14s]  It's a good sound effect.
[3330.14s -> 3335.16s]  I do appreciate this for dummies like me
[3335.70s -> 3337.86s]  that walk in circles and forget where I just was.
[3338.26s -> 3347.42s]  I do appreciate that lightning resistance.
[3350.03s -> 3353.94s]  Where are my here we go.
[3353.94s -> 3359.38s]  Well, these materials, strength.
[3363.17s -> 3365.25s]  So resistances are in the game.
[3365.49s -> 3370.26s]  That's cool to know.
[3390.11s -> 3391.47s]  Yeah, well, I'll check. I'll check on Nancy.
[3391.47s -> 3392.55s]  I will. I promise.
[3396.28s -> 3399.04s]  We just open up the other game and she's just screaming.
[3410.34s -> 3413.10s]  Where? OK, I've been over here this way.
[3415.85s -> 3427.11s]  Dude, she's wolf food now.
[3427.11s -> 3442.17s]  Tick tock tick tick. Go start a Nancy timer.
[3443.66s -> 3460.43s]  No, we're good. We're good. We're good.
[3460.43s -> 3462.51s]  I can do that two times before I have to do it again.
[3465.14s -> 3480.38s]  I think mana potions probably, right?
[3480.38s -> 3482.70s]  It's so funny because I can do
[3483.49s -> 3486.61s]  showing Nancy Drew was just going to be.
[3486.85s -> 3489.41s]  That was a bad idea because now everyone knows
[3489.69s -> 3491.77s]  that she's just sitting there looking at the clock.
[3502.08s -> 3504.44s]  I am curious, though, because I really do wonder
[3505.08s -> 3507.60s]  if there's a time limit on that game, that's going to be very funny, too.
[3507.60s -> 3532.22s]  So let's see how it plays out.
[3532.22s -> 3539.70s]  This is what we want.
[3539.70s -> 3543.02s]  I'll tell you that this this is fun.
[3544.06s -> 3549.46s]  This is this is fun to play.
[3549.46s -> 3552.06s]  This is a thousand times better than Diablo immortal.
[3552.38s -> 3554.42s]  I mean, and I mean a hundred million times.
[3562.03s -> 3571.06s]  I like I'm not excited yet.
[3571.94s -> 3574.46s]  Don't get excited.
[3574.46s -> 3575.90s]  You haven't played Diablo in a while.
[3575.90s -> 3577.74s]  That's why it's fun.
[3577.74s -> 3579.74s]  I'm not excited yet.
[3579.74s -> 3582.94s]  In fact, this, you know what I mean?
[3592.29s -> 3596.90s]  Lucky hit chance.
[3596.90s -> 3601.55s]  What is is a lucky hit a crit lucky hit?
[3602.84s -> 3612.10s]  I don't get it. It's a baby crit.
[3612.10s -> 3620.02s]  OK, well, so something.
[3620.02s -> 3622.30s]  Another thing I want to ask, which is important.
[3623.34s -> 3628.06s]  I didn't really think to ask this question originally.
[3628.06s -> 3633.66s]  This is not because Diablo three was like weapon power
[3634.32s -> 3637.99s]  is what scaled everything.
[3637.99s -> 3641.67s]  So this is just for damage and burning for 16 damage.
[3642.23s -> 3645.03s]  Is it like Diablo two and they just kind of got away from that
[3645.03s -> 3647.63s]  and its skills just do damage and you get plus two skills?
[3648.80s -> 3652.30s]  Or is it based on your weapon damage?
[3653.82s -> 3655.34s]  It is weapon damage.
[3655.34s -> 3664.10s]  It's weapon damage and intelligence.
[3664.10s -> 3666.30s]  I never played Diablo in my life.
[3666.30s -> 3669.68s]  Ask Nancy.
[3669.68s -> 3670.96s]  Oh, I'll ask. Yeah, I'll ask her.
[3670.96s -> 3682.04s]  Yeah, let's see what she says.
[3682.04s -> 3687.98s]  She's been reading this note.
[3687.98s -> 3690.22s]  It's still nine thirty, so no time has passed.
[3699.48s -> 3701.48s]  Only one guys, only one minute passed.
[3701.48s -> 3713.93s]  It's fine. All right. We're fine.
[3713.93s -> 3716.41s]  Wait. OK, hold on. It's nine thirty two.
[3716.41s -> 3722.70s]  Wait, I need to save it.
[3722.70s -> 3735.21s]  I need to know. I'm saving the game. OK.
[3736.30s -> 3737.74s]  We're going to let this run and see what happens.
[3737.74s -> 3739.62s]  Check back on her every 30 minutes. OK.
[3740.06s -> 3741.58s]  That sounds like a good idea. We'll see what happens.
[3741.58s -> 3744.86s]  She's looking at a wardrobe right now.
[3744.86s -> 3755.78s]  I'm curious what happens.
[3755.78s -> 3758.38s]  Six months are going to go by. She hasn't left her room.
[3759.62s -> 3761.74s]  She's going to be a skeleton when you go back.
[3778.80s -> 3779.92s]  That's it. Was that a yellow?
[3779.92s -> 3806.31s]  Oh, what? What Nancy drew in the corner?
[3807.26s -> 3809.66s]  I wish I could do that because that would be very funny.
[3809.66s -> 3812.10s]  It'd be a very interesting little joke to do today.
[3812.74s -> 3815.10s]  That game is so old.
[3815.10s -> 3818.54s]  It takes over the whole computer and it makes your resolution.
[3819.37s -> 3821.53s]  It just ruins the resolution on every screen.
[3821.85s -> 3844.59s]  And I just it's not possible.
[3844.59s -> 3856.66s]  It's like you put Diablo in the corner then.
[3858.49s -> 3860.77s]  No, you don't understand. I can't.
[3860.77s -> 3863.85s]  I can't like I cannot interact with any screen
[3863.85s -> 3866.09s]  when Nancy Drew is active on a monitor.
[3885.53s -> 3887.61s]  Put it in windowed. I tried. You can't.
[3887.61s -> 3896.21s]  It's too old. It's a cool little first boss.
[3897.55s -> 3923.82s]  This is cool.
[3923.82s -> 3926.38s]  I wonder how many difficulty tiers there's going to be.
[3938.97s -> 3945.71s]  Hi. All right.
[3945.71s -> 3947.43s]  We got to split this gear up.
[3947.43s -> 3951.22s]  I know it's all right. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes.
[3951.22s -> 3953.41s]  OK, so who's going to get what?
[3953.41s -> 3954.85s]  I mean, you're the rogue.
[3954.85s -> 3957.05s]  So you definitely take the dagger and I'm a sorcerer.
[3957.05s -> 3959.88s]  So I probably get staff, but I'm just relaxed.
[3959.88s -> 3962.60s]  It's really I'll take it so I can identify it.
[3962.60s -> 3975.75s]  And then core skill damage.
[3975.75s -> 3978.11s]  I'm imagining that's just abilities, right?
[3978.11s -> 3987.59s]  Because what core skill I'm imagining is these are not core skills.
[3997.46s -> 3998.70s]  That's all right.
[3998.70s -> 4002.46s]  I feel like it's not worth a point right now.
[4002.50s -> 4011.25s]  I just beef up fireball.
[4011.25s -> 4017.09s]  Oh, core core. I get it. Yeah.
[4017.09s -> 4021.20s]  I don't want to spread out too thin.
[4021.20s -> 4022.20s]  I think it's just fireball.
[4022.20s -> 4031.86s]  After casting a non-basic skill, you gain two percent resistance
[4031.86s -> 4035.30s]  to all elements and one percent additional resistance to that skills element.
[4037.49s -> 4041.86s]  That's not number goes higher when you click on somebody boring.
[4047.06s -> 4053.19s]  Let's do it with fireball.
[4053.19s -> 4060.82s]  That was pretty cool. It's fun.
[4065.16s -> 4071.61s]  I'm very much enjoying this more than I, I don't know, stop saying things.
[4072.56s -> 4074.68s]  I don't want to look back six months from now and be like,
[4074.80s -> 4077.20s]  remember when you played Diablo four and it's beta and you were like,
[4077.20s -> 4078.88s]  wow, oh, my God, it's so good.
[4078.88s -> 4080.08s]  And then you, you know what I mean?
[4080.08s -> 4082.32s]  I'm just going to this is I'm having a I'm having a good time.
[4082.76s -> 4091.39s]  I'm having a good time.
[4091.39s -> 4093.51s]  Your town should be safe now.
[4093.51s -> 4101.07s]  Truly by the centrist, Andy, I've that that's not even a step.
[4101.07s -> 4103.27s]  I'm just having a decent time playing the game.
[4103.67s -> 4105.55s]  I think it's fun so far.
[4105.55s -> 4107.47s]  That's me taking a take. That's a take.
[4147.43s -> 4149.90s]  Somebody get Nancy Drew on the fucking line.
[4149.90s -> 4162.05s]  There's been a murder.
[4162.05s -> 4181.73s]  What's wrong with me?
[4181.73s -> 4182.97s]  The hell is going on?
[4220.00s -> 4243.11s]  Turn it up.
[4243.11s -> 4244.63s]  So what? This wasn't a town after all.
[4244.63s -> 4248.28s]  This was a is this like a
[4248.28s -> 4251.08s]  they kind of like poisoned me or are they going to like sacrifice me or something?
[4251.80s -> 4284.78s]  Mother's blood, my mother's body.
[4285.78s -> 4290.30s]  So shall you witness her glory
[4292.56s -> 4295.00s]  before you die.
[4295.84s -> 4307.50s]  I'm not ready yet.
[4318.13s -> 4321.03s]  Coming to hold them to fill it.
[4322.23s -> 4326.95s]  Get up. We have to fight our way out.
[4330.68s -> 4334.00s]  Is the light preserve us?
[4334.00s -> 4339.02s]  Lost souls, all of you.
[4339.90s -> 4341.14s]  Oh, good.
[4346.16s -> 4347.92s]  Oh, a leather doublet.
[4347.92s -> 4349.64s]  I think that's better for me.
[4349.68s -> 4361.28s]  That was cool.
[4361.28s -> 4372.84s]  That was creepy. Interesting.
[4372.84s -> 4376.03s]  That was all of them like willing.
[4379.66s -> 4384.94s]  Oh, hold on. Wait a minute.
[4384.94s -> 4391.28s]  Oh, more healing received.
[4391.28s -> 4393.66s]  Oh, it's a dagger.
[4393.66s -> 4395.78s]  I need to put that on the bar, don't I?
[4395.78s -> 4398.99s]  Hmm. Am I ever going to be doing this?
[4398.99s -> 4407.42s]  Probably not ever.
[4407.42s -> 4409.82s]  You're the madman from the shed.
[4409.82s -> 4411.23s]  Madman.
[4411.23s -> 4414.55s]  Those heretics drugged me after I returned from the ruins.
[4415.07s -> 4416.75s]  Just like you.
[4416.75s -> 4417.91s]  I came to my wits.
[4417.91s -> 4419.19s]  You've adopted so far.
[4419.19s -> 4422.07s]  Try to get inside the chapel, but it was locked.
[4425.25s -> 4431.81s]  Manner of evil is this.
[4431.81s -> 4434.37s]  What petals?
[4434.37s -> 4436.45s]  I don't think that came out that way.
[4437.65s -> 4440.50s]  Hey, that was to fed them to me.
[4442.17s -> 4444.09s]  A blasphemous ritual.
[4444.09s -> 4446.16s]  How did they learn this?
[4446.16s -> 4449.36s]  Perhaps the answer lies in the chapel.
[4450.24s -> 4452.68s]  They kept it locked up for a reason.
[4453.52s -> 4456.88s]  The key might be on that woman who was leading them.
[4459.98s -> 4461.74s]  Mute your mic.
[4461.74s -> 4466.69s]  No. OK, look, the chapel key from the corpse.
[4468.17s -> 4479.62s]  Oh, cool.
[4479.62s -> 4485.92s]  Yeah. What else is going on over here?
[4485.92s -> 4492.62s]  Why does it want me to go over this way?
[4492.62s -> 4522.50s]  Oh, um, isn't beta only fire.
[4522.50s -> 4527.26s]  The smart thing to do is just always have your game in zero point nine, nine, nine.
[4530.90s -> 4532.30s]  It's just you never in one point.
[4532.30s -> 4542.66s]  It's still, you know, blood petals like the ones I was fed.
[4542.66s -> 4544.73s]  Don't ever come out of it.
[4544.73s -> 4547.01s]  Is this real? Nancy Drew would have solved this.
[4582.57s -> 4583.33s]  Those who they're asked.
[4583.33s -> 4586.49s]  Yeah, I'm playing the Resident Evil 4 remake on launch day.
[4589.14s -> 4591.10s]  Get your ass. That's happening.
[4591.10s -> 4606.14s]  Shameful. Our father has granted you a path to salvation.
[4607.14s -> 4613.09s]  And yet you stray from it at every opportunity.
[4614.29s -> 4616.69s]  You drink and gamble.
[4617.77s -> 4620.69s]  You covet and steal.
[4622.05s -> 4628.65s]  Shameful. So if you eat these, you
[4638.78s -> 4642.51s]  sin is their birthright.
[4649.49s -> 4651.69s]  What about God? Oh, my God.
[4651.69s -> 4664.12s]  My children of hell are coming to devour our salvation lies, not in the light.
[4664.40s -> 4673.99s]  But in you, the faith has taught you to deny your heart's desire
[4675.11s -> 4678.87s]  and turned you into a prisoner within yourself.
[4679.15s -> 4680.83s]  She's made out of wood.
[4680.83s -> 4688.50s]  Break the chains and discover who you were meant to be.
[4691.05s -> 4697.73s]  Break the chains and be beautiful in sin.
[4707.70s -> 4709.78s]  What are you doing?
[4709.78s -> 4712.66s]  Resist. Resist her temptation.
[4719.38s -> 4722.61s]  Lani, it's me.
[4722.61s -> 4724.97s]  I brought your child into this world.
[4726.97s -> 4728.66s]  What's going on?
[4728.66s -> 4741.02s]  Why is the audio so slow down?
[4749.38s -> 4765.78s]  My God, they just destroyed this guy.
[4765.78s -> 4770.14s]  Go to the dry steps and continue your preparations.
[4771.90s -> 4774.78s]  Now true work begins.
[4776.02s -> 4797.74s]  Hey, guys, only only one minute has passed in the world of Nancy Drew.
[4797.74s -> 4803.10s]  So, hey, guys, one minute in Nancy Drew time is an hour in real life.
[4803.10s -> 4806.14s]  Right. It's like the time is passed slower here.
[4813.37s -> 4816.22s]  Let me just go ahead and do reconnect.
[4821.19s -> 4822.55s]  Let me just start the queue again.
[4822.55s -> 4825.27s]  And it's it's just going to get longer and longer, isn't it?
[4828.75s -> 4832.30s]  It was P.M. before. Was it?
[4833.93s -> 4842.02s]  No. Yes, it was.
[4842.02s -> 4846.01s]  No, it wasn't.
[4846.05s -> 4848.09s]  Give me a second. I got to just reconnect.
[4850.83s -> 4855.14s]  It's so funny, like immersion.
[4855.14s -> 4857.46s]  Like this this unbelievable.
[4857.46s -> 4859.86s]  OK, it's a 20 minute queue, by the way.
[4859.86s -> 4864.54s]  This amazing world of Diablo and all these these crazy cutscenes.
[4864.54s -> 4869.60s]  And it's the immersion just gets just snapped out of reality.
[4870.30s -> 4874.42s]  What is just like, and let them come, let them try to find us.
[4874.42s -> 4877.22s]  We will be buried into the caverns like.
[4877.22s -> 4881.21s]  You've been disconnected.
[4881.21s -> 4882.69s]  It's a video game. It's a video game.
[4882.69s -> 4884.25s]  It's a video game. It's a video game.
[4884.25s -> 4887.65s]  It's like, oh, shit. OK, it's a video game.
[4887.65s -> 4890.30s]  It's right. Damn it.
[4890.30s -> 4891.74s]  It's a video game.
[4891.74s -> 4899.10s]  And I'm connected to a video game.
[4899.10s -> 4901.26s]  Do you actually want to a movie?
[4901.26s -> 4904.10s]  And 10, 20 minutes of the movie, there's a very touching scene
[4904.10s -> 4906.10s]  with this like a very insane scene.
[4906.10s -> 4907.30s]  Something crazy happens.
[4907.30s -> 4910.10s]  And the movie, it's like, wow, like, like Thanos, like
[4911.10s -> 4914.54s]  And it freezes on Thanos doing this with like the Infinity Gauntlet.
[4915.06s -> 4917.14s]  And it just it just says, ladies and gentlemen,
[4917.14s -> 4919.94s]  I would like to remind you that you are watching a movie.
[4920.49s -> 4921.85s]  This is a movie.
[4921.85s -> 4926.86s]  And isn't it an interesting one?
[4926.86s -> 4929.31s]  Now, please use the bathroom.
[4929.31s -> 4933.23s]  Please go and get some snacks at the concession stand.
[4933.55s -> 4935.55s]  We'll be back in 20 minutes.
[4935.55s -> 4937.63s]  It's like, I was fucking watching that.
[4941.46s -> 4945.14s]  That's kind of how it feels like playing like a day one launch sometimes.
[4947.02s -> 4953.74s]  OK, I'm ready.
[4953.74s -> 4955.74s]  No, it's I'm clicking out of the window. Come on.
[4957.90s -> 4976.78s]  All right. So what are we doing?
[4976.78s -> 4982.55s]  Am I like opening this person's door?
[4982.55s -> 4985.30s]  I have to call Ned.
[4985.30s -> 4990.96s]  No, we're not doing that.
[4990.96s -> 4994.72s]  This must be where I drop the laundry bag after I'm done cleaning all the rooms.
[4995.42s -> 4996.90s]  This shoot is for dirty laundry.
[4996.90s -> 5006.54s]  OK, so we're going to clean the rooms.
[5006.54s -> 5010.53s]  Well, huh? What was that?
[5010.53s -> 5011.85s]  What was that?
[5047.72s -> 5055.38s]  I got to clean the rooms.
[5055.38s -> 5063.10s]  Don't have the key.
[5063.14s -> 5068.52s]  How do I get in here?
[5068.52s -> 5070.68s]  How do I get in here?
[5070.68s -> 5085.15s]  You have to make breakfast first.
[5085.15s -> 5087.91s]  Bone, which Trapper Dan found near the lodge.
[5087.91s -> 5091.71s]  He believed it came from a race of giants known as Rex's.
[5092.47s -> 5094.03s]  The bone's not there.
[5094.03s -> 5095.27s]  Wonder what happened to it.
[5095.27s -> 5096.51s]  Find the bone.
[5103.72s -> 5110.33s]  So I've been playing a lot of Diablo.
[5110.33s -> 5114.30s]  Blue, red, white, green, blue, red.
[5115.66s -> 5128.34s]  I somebody remember that one.
[5128.34s -> 5140.31s]  Hmm. How would you read that?
[5140.31s -> 5143.27s]  That's not it. That's like a two point font.
[5146.62s -> 5148.98s]  Sasquatch sightings hit five year low.
[5151.03s -> 5153.39s]  Area man attacked by Wolverine.
[5156.33s -> 5158.49s]  That's just the name of the next Marvel movie coming up.
[5160.99s -> 5165.51s]  Don't forget to catch area man attacked by Wolverine in theaters this Friday.
[5168.78s -> 5176.70s]  We're getting there.
[5176.70s -> 5179.71s]  I think that's hello.
[5179.71s -> 5180.87s]  Well, hello there.
[5180.87s -> 5183.11s]  You must be the new maid Ali told us about.
[5183.39s -> 5184.63s]  I'm Bill Kessler.
[5184.63s -> 5186.15s]  This guy's Lou Talbot.
[5186.15s -> 5188.31s]  Hey, what's your name again?
[5188.67s -> 5190.31s]  Nancy, Nancy Drew.
[5190.31s -> 5192.47s]  Just thought I'd come over and say hello.
[5192.47s -> 5194.23s]  Well, Lou, here's a grad student.
[5194.23s -> 5196.23s]  Art major of all things.
[5196.23s -> 5199.39s]  You're probably going to need a jackhammer and some hydrochloric acid
[5199.39s -> 5200.91s]  to clean his roommate.
[5200.91s -> 5202.59s]  Are you two old friends?
[5202.59s -> 5205.43s]  Not hardly. I've known Lou for all of what?
[5205.71s -> 5206.91s]  But a week, I guess.
[5206.91s -> 5208.67s]  I checked in right after he did.
[5208.67s -> 5211.91s]  We sat down after breakfast one morning and discovered that this fox
[5211.91s -> 5213.67s]  and geese game is pretty darn fun.
[5213.67s -> 5215.79s]  I've been whipping his tail ever since.
[5216.63s -> 5217.63s]  Hmm.
[5219.02s -> 5221.42s]  You didn't just come here to play games, did you?
[5221.58s -> 5222.86s]  Heck, no.
[5222.86s -> 5224.34s]  I came for the ice fishing.
[5224.34s -> 5227.14s]  Of course, knowing there's a renegade wolf running around
[5227.14s -> 5229.34s]  is kind of damp in my enthusiasm.
[5231.40s -> 5233.99s]  Have you seen the wolf?
[5233.99s -> 5235.79s]  Have you seen the wolf?
[5235.79s -> 5238.95s]  Just heard it every night since I've been here, in fact,
[5239.15s -> 5241.07s]  gets creepier each time.
[5241.07s -> 5242.15s]  They should get rid of it.
[5242.15s -> 5243.47s]  And the sooner the better.
[5243.47s -> 5246.71s]  They didn't put up with wolves prowling around this place 40 years ago,
[5246.79s -> 5248.67s]  and they shouldn't put up with them now.
[5248.67s -> 5250.71s]  What are you, Little Red Riding Hood?
[5250.95s -> 5252.99s]  That wolf's not hurting anybody.
[5252.99s -> 5254.99s]  People should just leave it alone.
[5254.99s -> 5258.47s]  You'll be singing a different tune when it has some little kid for breakfast
[5258.47s -> 5260.31s]  than has you for lunch.
[5260.31s -> 5262.23s]  Not going to happen, dude.
[5262.23s -> 5267.27s]  Trust me, if something bad can happen, chances are it eventually will, dude.
[5267.87s -> 5269.39s]  Hey, I know what you can do.
[5269.39s -> 5272.99s]  Shovel the snow off the skating pond so we can do some speed skating.
[5273.39s -> 5275.55s]  Lou here thinks he's faster than me.
[5275.55s -> 5276.75s]  You're like ancient.
[5276.75s -> 5278.43s]  Course I'm faster than you.
[5278.47s -> 5280.71s]  You may have youth on your side, my friend,
[5280.71s -> 5283.63s]  but I've been working construction since before you were born,
[5283.67s -> 5286.67s]  which means I am more fit now than you will ever be.
[5286.71s -> 5287.47s]  Go shovel the pond.
[5287.47s -> 5289.47s]  Get that pond shoveled so we can settle this.
[5289.47s -> 5291.63s]  OK, kiddo? Consider it done.
[5293.17s -> 5295.89s]  OK, so we got to shovel the pond.
[5301.36s -> 5303.00s]  Not time for kitchen duty yet.
[5303.00s -> 5315.62s]  OK, wait, where's my schedule?
[5315.62s -> 5319.54s]  Oh, shit, this is the key. All right.
[5319.54s -> 5320.82s]  OK, OK, OK, OK.
[5320.82s -> 5323.32s]  All right. OK, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5323.36s -> 5326.58s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5330.03s -> 5334.15s]  I want to turn the page.
[5334.15s -> 5337.86s]  I want to turn the page.
[5337.86s -> 5341.34s]  I want to turn the page of the book because I want to see the my schedule.
[5342.56s -> 5346.74s]  Turn the page. I can't turn the page.
[5346.74s -> 5350.43s]  OK, I can't turn the page.
[5350.43s -> 5351.39s]  There's no more pages. Yeah.
[5351.39s -> 5353.71s]  Where wouldn't it like a telling me all these things?
[5359.79s -> 5360.95s]  I can't do the kitchen yet.
[5360.95s -> 5366.15s]  What is this here?
[5366.15s -> 5371.86s]  Do I have to get everything?
[5371.86s -> 5385.58s]  OK, I think I have to get everything the same animal.
[5385.58s -> 5388.90s]  OK, so it's I got to make this and I got to go like this.
[5395.39s -> 5400.09s]  Oh, shit, it's going to be all moose.
[5402.62s -> 5404.06s]  All right. Hold on.
[5404.06s -> 5406.23s]  I got to get this to the right spot.
[5406.23s -> 5411.51s]  So to get all mooses, all meeses, most mooses, moose.
[5411.51s -> 5418.70s]  It's just moose, right?
[5418.70s -> 5426.98s]  Me all moose, all meese, meeses.
[5431.00s -> 5433.80s]  All right. You're distracting me.
[5433.80s -> 5435.56s]  OK, let's figure this out.
[5435.56s -> 5444.49s]  If I need to do all moose, fuck it.
[5444.85s -> 5447.49s]  I'm so torn apart in like three directions.
[5448.78s -> 5460.75s]  OK, I need to get a second.
[5460.75s -> 5464.30s]  OK. All right. I'm ready.
[5464.30s -> 5469.83s]  This needs to be so to get this all.
[5469.83s -> 5472.14s]  So I need to get this. Let's go like this.
[5472.14s -> 5478.48s]  It's raccoon, raccoon, raccoon, raccoon, raccoon.
[5482.69s -> 5486.42s]  There we go. Now there we are.
[5487.56s -> 5499.13s]  OK, Izzy wasn't even hard.
[5499.13s -> 5521.10s]  I messed it up. I got it.
[5526.17s -> 5535.70s]  It's not it's not all meeses.
[5535.70s -> 5541.80s]  Needs to be all raccoons, all wolves, all pigs, all raccoons, all mooses.
[5541.80s -> 5543.62s]  What is it? Is it wolves?
[5543.62s -> 5544.86s]  It's definitely wolves. All right.
[5544.86s -> 5549.22s]  Everything is ready. I just have to move it.
[5549.22s -> 5550.34s]  It's definitely why would it not?
[5550.34s -> 5551.46s]  Why would it be moose?
[5551.46s -> 5556.10s]  The whole game is based around this ice wolf in the forest.
[5556.38s -> 5559.10s]  Why would it be moose?
[5559.10s -> 5560.74s]  OK, let's get it.
[5560.74s -> 5584.78s]  Shit, that's all wolves.
[5587.05s -> 5589.37s]  I don't think this is I don't think we have the solution to this yet.
[5598.46s -> 5609.67s]  Worth a shot. Chicken Ridge.
[5609.67s -> 5612.43s]  OK, so they want me to go outside.
[5612.79s -> 5615.17s]  I could do that.
[5615.17s -> 5618.82s]  What is that?
[5632.79s -> 5636.35s]  Is the lake better not follow this trail until I know for sure where it goes.
[5636.39s -> 5637.71s]  Oh, you'll be fine.
[5637.71s -> 5640.77s]  Just bring enough sandwiches to last you there too.
[5642.58s -> 5653.94s]  OK, here we go. It's getting fun.
[5653.94s -> 5657.37s]  Don't ever underestimate our four
[5657.81s -> 5662.90s]  bologna and cheese sandwiches wrapped in like sandwich wrap.
[5664.26s -> 5666.13s]  Don't underestimate it.
[5666.13s -> 5670.66s]  Guess I better get this pond shoveled off.
[5670.66s -> 5685.17s]  OK, so I need to.
[5685.17s -> 5695.86s]  How do I do that?
[5695.86s -> 5699.26s]  It's like it's like Minesweeper, but how do I have to hold click?
[5702.97s -> 5716.46s]  Holding click is not doing anything.
[5716.46s -> 5718.00s]  Bash it with the shovel.
[5718.00s -> 5720.02s]  Start in a corner.
[5720.02s -> 5728.05s]  Oh, shit. OK, so this is unsafe.
[5728.05s -> 5734.67s]  I don't touch that one.
[5734.67s -> 5737.63s]  So this is unsafe.
[5737.63s -> 5743.53s]  How do I know it's safe?
[5743.53s -> 5750.01s]  Just don't step on that.
[5750.01s -> 5752.18s]  So wait, this is safe.
[5752.18s -> 5757.26s]  This is unsafe.
[5757.26s -> 5759.68s]  He's never played Minesweeper.
[5759.68s -> 5763.80s]  I mean, I've played the amount of time that most people that have a Windows
[5763.80s -> 5766.64s]  machine played Minesweeper and as you opened it for 10 seconds,
[5767.16s -> 5772.43s]  put it on the highest possible difficulty and then clicked in one spot and lost.
[5774.12s -> 5777.08s]  Or you put it on the lowest possible difficulty.
[5777.58s -> 5782.71s]  Click in three places and win.
[5782.71s -> 5788.02s]  I understand the concept of Minesweeper, but like what am I trying to?
[5788.14s -> 5793.45s]  I guess I'm just right.
[5793.45s -> 5797.41s]  OK, so that means that there I don't even know what this is trying to tell me, though.
[5802.66s -> 5803.94s]  All right. So this is a little bit.
[5803.94s -> 5812.34s]  This is kind of this is. Yeah.
[5812.34s -> 5813.78s]  Yes, but I'm OK now.
[5813.78s -> 5815.74s]  I just got a little wet and cold.
[5815.74s -> 5817.46s]  Actually, I got really cold.
[5817.46s -> 5819.94s]  My lips turned this really interesting shade of violet.
[5819.98s -> 5825.09s]  What I know.
[5825.09s -> 5827.33s]  I'll be more careful next time. I promise.
[5834.43s -> 5847.20s]  You don't mean if you don't want to concern your employer,
[5847.72s -> 5850.90s]  you don't say, you know what I mean?
[5850.90s -> 5852.38s]  Like, oh, yeah.
[5852.38s -> 5854.02s]  Hey, so everything OK? Oh, yeah.
[5854.02s -> 5858.86s]  Hey, dude, my lips turned this really crazy shade of purple.
[5859.22s -> 5862.17s]  It's like, huh?
[5862.17s -> 5865.10s]  What are you talking about?
[5865.10s -> 5868.58s]  That was that was like a funny thing for Nancy to say.
[5868.58s -> 5870.90s]  That was like, oh, my lips turned purple.
[5871.77s -> 5873.45s]  Now, are you all right?
[5873.45s -> 5874.69s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[5874.69s -> 5875.45s]  You got to go check.
[5875.45s -> 5879.20s]  We got to check you out at the doctor.
[5879.20s -> 5881.72s]  Guess I better get this pond shoveled off.
[5881.72s -> 5891.30s]  OK, well, and fun, Nancy.
[5891.30s -> 5893.90s]  See you in a little bit.
[5893.90s -> 5905.25s]  Don't worry, Nancy. We absolutely will be back.
[5905.25s -> 5917.54s]  See you in probably 30 minutes.
[5917.54s -> 5922.62s]  She's freezing. She's fine.
[5922.62s -> 5928.30s]  There's a timer.
[5928.30s -> 5929.82s]  I don't think the game.
[5929.82s -> 5931.18s]  Here's the thing.
[5931.18s -> 5934.66s]  I don't think the game is active if it is alt tabbed.
[5935.70s -> 5938.14s]  I think we're going to be fine.
[5938.14s -> 5941.46s]  I believe the Nancy Drew client has to be active.
[5950.06s -> 5953.58s]  My lips turned this wacky shade of violet.
[5958.14s -> 5960.90s]  Only fire can cleanse the darkness.
[5960.90s -> 5962.58s]  I can do that.
[5962.58s -> 5963.70s]  Have a look inside.
[5963.70s -> 5966.30s]  But hurry, I will prepare the torch.
[5971.25s -> 5975.20s]  Blood petals like the ones I was fed.
[5976.42s -> 5978.42s]  Here, we already saw this on this real.
[5989.92s -> 5991.00s]  We already saw that.
[5991.04s -> 5993.28s]  You came to thank the light.
[5997.81s -> 6000.37s]  You collapsed inside.
[6000.37s -> 6002.49s]  I thought that darkness had swallowed you.
[6004.27s -> 6014.09s]  OK, we are good.
[6014.09s -> 6016.46s]  Why do you skip?
[6016.46s -> 6018.10s]  We not see that one.
[6018.10s -> 6019.42s]  Oh, shit. That's right.
[6019.42s -> 6021.78s]  It happened. Oh, that's right.
[6021.78s -> 6025.69s]  Oops. Can you say it again?
[6025.69s -> 6028.65s]  Oops. He surrounds himself as it ended.
[6029.13s -> 6030.33s]  I forgot. Sorry.
[6030.33s -> 6035.13s]  Tread carefully and pray he has not fallen to Lilith as well.
[6036.66s -> 6039.62s]  It's a beta. We're going to see this all in a week or two anyways.
[6042.43s -> 6044.79s]  All right. There's a hermit that I have to find.
[6044.79s -> 6048.15s]  Lilith Lilith is able to manipulate people.
[6049.70s -> 6052.99s]  She's the lord of manipulation.
[6052.99s -> 6055.62s]  Lord of all right.
[6055.62s -> 6058.50s]  Permanent stat boost to all characters on the realm.
[6062.28s -> 6064.48s]  Maximum capacity of murmuring all balls.
[6067.96s -> 6072.74s]  Blame and alter of Lilith.
[6072.74s -> 6080.98s]  OK, interesting.
[6080.98s -> 6084.16s]  This is permanent reward.
[6084.16s -> 6086.56s]  Lucky commoner player title.
[6089.15s -> 6093.62s]  All right, let's keep going.
[6095.40s -> 6105.94s]  Very loud.
[6105.94s -> 6107.94s]  Guys, it's still so loud.
[6107.94s -> 6109.98s]  Every time I restart the game, it gets louder.
[6115.27s -> 6137.92s]  Greetings, gold Thunder Bear out of manor.
[6145.67s -> 6150.47s]  It's an elite.
[6150.47s -> 6157.66s]  Can I say how do I sell stuff?
[6157.66s -> 6159.18s]  This looks like a granny like.
[6159.18s -> 6160.30s]  I can assure you it's not.
[6160.30s -> 6162.50s]  Nancy Drew is more a granny like than this.
[6163.80s -> 6182.04s]  That's actually in fact, all of your hits are crits.
[6191.06s -> 6209.67s]  Cool. Going fast to random dungeon.
[6210.58s -> 6213.26s]  Sellers are small chambers that can contain a wide range of content.
[6215.26s -> 6228.50s]  Let's check it out.
[6228.50s -> 6236.54s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[6236.54s -> 6238.74s]  Turtles have his engaged skeleton captain.
[6254.35s -> 6256.06s]  Yeah, I'm not.
[6267.86s -> 6270.71s]  OK, that was just like an elite.
[6270.71s -> 6273.64s]  Anything else in here?
[6273.64s -> 6275.88s]  What do you think Nancy Drew's internal temperature is right now?
[6276.60s -> 6290.41s]  Probably low. Slain militia.
[6291.21s -> 6293.99s]  Ooh, try salvage.
[6293.99s -> 6297.37s]  Just as soon as we hold the salvage button, right?
[6297.37s -> 6300.69s]  Because you can do that, can't you own a mark as junk?
[6304.07s -> 6309.66s]  Is this junk?
[6309.66s -> 6314.86s]  Hold on a second.
[6314.86s -> 6316.58s]  Fifty two damage a second.
[6316.58s -> 6320.44s]  This is a staff.
[6320.44s -> 6325.82s]  You definitely should put this on.
[6325.82s -> 6328.14s]  This is more of a core damage.
[6331.21s -> 6354.34s]  Yeah, I'm going to this way.
[6354.34s -> 6356.79s]  Oh, man. Get Elden Ringed.
[6359.73s -> 6373.98s]  Is this OK?
[6373.98s -> 6376.14s]  Resistance to all one max health.
[6376.14s -> 6382.70s]  Better than what? Better than nothing.
[6398.50s -> 6401.06s]  He's he's in Green's Omega law.
[6403.59s -> 6405.91s]  I'm going to I just started the game.
[6423.06s -> 6425.14s]  I like fire. It's good.
[6425.14s -> 6440.80s]  Like the big splash challenge.
[6440.80s -> 6454.18s]  Swift Hunter was I mean, I'm down.
[6468.51s -> 6473.23s]  Green is frozen.
[6473.23s -> 6476.02s]  I think we're fine. We try.
[6479.38s -> 6490.95s]  Oh, Nancy is.
[6490.95s -> 6513.83s]  Yeah, I see what you mean. I see.
[6513.83s -> 6515.55s]  I got it. I think I'm going the right way, right?
[6515.55s -> 6526.02s]  Group up, group up, group up.
[6526.02s -> 6530.14s]  Am I the only streamer doing fire?
[6530.14s -> 6541.00s]  If not, I'll change.
[6541.00s -> 6551.64s]  What else is down here?
[6551.64s -> 6553.54s]  Is anybody else streaming this?
[6553.54s -> 6555.58s]  I think a lot of people were today, weren't they?
[6559.57s -> 6563.96s]  I always go back up.
[6567.13s -> 6577.07s]  All right. Find the hermit's cabin.
[6577.07s -> 6580.63s]  Herbs and ore can be found throughout the world and are used by artisans
[6580.63s -> 6586.69s]  for a variety of functions.
[6586.69s -> 6595.74s]  We wait as this material of this, like, OK.
[6600.70s -> 6604.66s]  Lightberry is crafting.
[6605.54s -> 6609.68s]  This is literally for tonight.
[6609.68s -> 6613.54s]  Quite for tonight.
[6613.54s -> 6616.34s]  I don't mind crafting that light.
[6616.34s -> 6618.10s]  Crafting is fun.
[6618.10s -> 6619.54s]  I think it's cool.
[6619.54s -> 6625.30s]  I don't mind it.
[6625.30s -> 6630.50s]  I actually do not mind random busy work in game sometimes.
[6630.50s -> 6641.22s]  I don't really mind it.
[6641.22s -> 6643.42s]  Now, this is the kind of thing you just hop in a discord call
[6643.42s -> 6655.30s]  and it's just like you just doing it doing what?
[6655.66s -> 6658.30s]  Picking up herbs and spices and more.
[6661.05s -> 6666.06s]  And you make like a like a steak.
[6666.06s -> 6670.00s]  It's my one friend.
[6670.00s -> 6674.27s]  I have one friend.
[6674.27s -> 6681.38s]  OK, or picking up herbs with the bros.
[6683.66s -> 6698.71s]  Yeah, sometimes you just pick up herbs with the bros.
[6698.71s -> 6701.06s]  This is better.
[6701.06s -> 6702.10s]  Will. OK, hold on.
[6702.10s -> 6704.89s]  I should look at this first.
[6704.89s -> 6710.13s]  Strength is armor.
[6710.13s -> 6712.37s]  This is skill damage and resistance.
[6714.10s -> 6716.46s]  This is resource, Jen.
[6716.46s -> 6726.31s]  Healing received and what is overpower damage overpower?
[6727.15s -> 6731.33s]  These are new terms.
[6731.33s -> 6734.57s]  The lucky hits overpower damage.
[6734.57s -> 6737.26s]  This is new. I don't know.
[6737.26s -> 6747.44s]  Aspects are going to run out of inventory space.
[6750.35s -> 6757.52s]  Whatever is still glowing.
[6757.52s -> 6767.47s]  How much you throwing in for the herbs?
[6767.47s -> 6768.67s]  You can play pizza tower some more.
[6768.67s -> 6772.41s]  Probably not. Not on stream.
[6772.41s -> 6775.05s]  I think I got exactly what I wanted out of that game and it was fantastic.
[6775.05s -> 6778.46s]  So I'm not really the type to get
[6779.18s -> 6781.46s]  you know, P rank or S rank on every level.
[6781.46s -> 6784.24s]  So I got what I wanted out of it.
[6784.24s -> 6796.02s]  Is anyone here?
[6796.02s -> 6797.10s]  No, I got it first try.
[6797.10s -> 6798.90s]  I wanted to like look around.
[6798.90s -> 6801.06s]  I wanted to Nancy Drew, by the way.
[6801.06s -> 6802.54s]  Nancy, how are you doing?
[6802.54s -> 6822.40s]  You all right? We're fine.
[6822.40s -> 6834.17s]  I didn't mean to click twice.
[6834.17s -> 6848.40s]  He's all right. Herbs, mushrooms, organs, healers, tools.
[6856.64s -> 6860.22s]  I suppose anything in it.
[6860.22s -> 6863.20s]  Strange skull.
[6865.26s -> 6869.98s]  Young freshly turned easy kill
[6870.89s -> 6873.99s]  further south than the others.
[6873.99s -> 6880.64s]  They're spreading. OK.
[6919.35s -> 6921.79s]  If you're going to trespass into my home,
[6925.46s -> 6928.98s]  rifle through my things.
[6928.98s -> 6932.29s]  And at least have the decency to join me for supper.
[6933.77s -> 6938.06s]  Bloody hungry.
[6938.06s -> 6941.46s]  It's not the it's not the response.
[6941.46s -> 6944.24s]  I would think would happen.
[6944.24s -> 6947.86s]  That's quite the story.
[6947.90s -> 6950.86s]  I wish it wasn't true, but it is.
[6954.46s -> 6957.10s]  Why did I have that vision?
[6957.10s -> 6959.62s]  Thank those friendly villages.
[6959.62s -> 6966.81s]  They gave you the blood of Lewis, the blood of a demon.
[6967.76s -> 6971.87s]  Not just any demon, the daughter of hatred,
[6972.51s -> 6975.74s]  the mother of sanctuary.
[6975.74s -> 6979.04s]  She was banished ages ago.
[6979.04s -> 6981.48s]  But this world is her creation.
[6985.29s -> 6987.85s]  It was prophesied she would come back.
[6987.85s -> 6990.95s]  We know this person's name won't.
[6990.95s -> 6993.65s]  That's the question.
[6993.65s -> 6996.81s]  Sanctuary has always been trapped amid the eternal conflict.
[6998.61s -> 7000.89s]  A war between angels and demons.
[7000.89s -> 7004.46s]  But Lilith serves neither side.
[7005.10s -> 7008.34s]  She has her own plans for us and me.
[7009.39s -> 7012.95s]  And my people that have booming low voices like this.
[7013.23s -> 7015.51s]  I wonder what happens if you pitch this down.
[7018.83s -> 7020.15s]  What it sound like.
[7020.15s -> 7023.23s]  Use it. Find out what she's after.
[7026.38s -> 7028.92s]  Then we're in this together.
[7028.92s -> 7031.46s]  Rest while you can.
[7031.46s -> 7033.34s]  Then we'll start to kill the shot.
[7033.34s -> 7035.46s]  Do it. Oh, I don't.
[7035.46s -> 7036.98s]  Reporting software right here.
[7036.98s -> 7038.98s]  Record the audio.
[7038.98s -> 7054.43s]  We'll all company Lorath to kill Vashad.
[7056.16s -> 7058.28s]  Oh, wait, I have new points tonight.
[7059.62s -> 7059.94s]  All right.
[7059.94s -> 7063.10s]  Should I be boring Barry and just keep doing fireball?
[7063.10s -> 7071.34s]  Or should I keep should I do something else?
[7071.34s -> 7077.71s]  That's kind of good.
[7077.71s -> 7080.51s]  The radius increases for distance traveled.
[7082.94s -> 7085.07s]  That's pretty good.
[7085.15s -> 7087.11s]  Keep it hot. Keep it hot.
[7087.11s -> 7102.46s]  OK, it's going to go boring, Barry.
[7102.46s -> 7104.54s]  Herbs and spices and jewels and chips.
[7108.31s -> 7130.44s]  I'm OK doing boring, Barry. It just works.
[7130.44s -> 7132.36s]  I honestly don't.
[7132.36s -> 7149.92s]  I can't hear what he's saying.
[7149.92s -> 7162.47s]  Ah, Shaman.
[7162.47s -> 7163.71s]  Jerma changes the audio mixing.
[7163.71s -> 7168.13s]  Jerma, I can't hear what he says.
[7168.13s -> 7174.82s]  I mean, the audio mixing is in line with the way that you know what I'm saying?
[7175.66s -> 7176.86s]  Like, I should be able to hear it fine.
[7176.86s -> 7179.18s]  Greetings, greetings, greetings.
[7179.18s -> 7180.26s]  The audio mixing was fine.
[7180.26s -> 7181.94s]  It's just, you know what?
[7181.94s -> 7184.34s]  Time that person out for one full minute.
[7188.16s -> 7190.84s]  No, OK, it's the effects volume that has to come down.
[7191.94s -> 7194.78s]  Dialogue come up, effects come down, music up a little,
[7195.22s -> 7198.74s]  master volume up a little bit, ambient down, dialogue up.
[7199.86s -> 7216.77s]  There. Perfect.
[7216.77s -> 7218.21s]  Out of mana.
[7218.21s -> 7219.45s]  All right. Now that's too loud.
[7219.45s -> 7222.26s]  He's talking into my ears.
[7222.26s -> 7226.06s]  He just leaned over from behind my chair out of mana.
[7227.18s -> 7229.46s]  Dude, get away from me.
[7250.62s -> 7261.08s]  Out of mana.
[7261.08s -> 7264.96s]  I just imagine there's a fucking actor in the room right now.
[7264.96s -> 7270.12s]  Just the angel in.
[7270.12s -> 7271.68s]  I'm sure you've heard the Cathedral of Life.
[7271.68s -> 7274.63s]  It's dressed as a sorcerer.
[7274.63s -> 7276.70s]  Well, he's real.
[7276.70s -> 7280.18s]  An angel walks across his arms, pacing back and forth to cloak on.
[7280.18s -> 7282.18s]  Like Lilith is here.
[7282.18s -> 7283.22s]  Blood will flow.
[7283.22s -> 7286.23s]  I wouldn't have done it like that ancient enemies.
[7286.23s -> 7290.07s]  They'll drag the whole damn world into their feud unless we can stop it.
[7293.43s -> 7294.95s]  Let's not linger.
[7294.95s -> 7296.75s]  Keovashad lies just ahead.
[7296.75s -> 7310.58s]  Roads blocked should clear up when the storm has passed.
[7324.18s -> 7327.31s]  Oh, it's a town.
[7327.31s -> 7329.35s]  You need to have an original thought right now.
[7329.35s -> 7331.55s]  Hold. What are you talking about?
[7331.55s -> 7337.70s]  We have no time for this.
[7337.70s -> 7339.56s]  What does that mean?
[7339.56s -> 7342.60s]  To answer Keovashad, you must perform a cleansing ritual.
[7343.16s -> 7346.99s]  Meaningless gesture, but some people take comfort in it.
[7346.99s -> 7349.29s]  How dare you?
[7349.29s -> 7351.41s]  Just let him through, lad.
[7351.41s -> 7356.01s]  I've tried for years to get Lorath to do the ritual.
[7356.01s -> 7358.81s]  Fine, but this one stays.
[7358.81s -> 7361.20s]  I'll meet you inside.
[7364.11s -> 7371.43s]  Take a piece of holy cedar wood from the shrine and inscribe it with the sin which troubles you.
[7371.43s -> 7374.55s]  Then cast it into the brazier.
[7374.55s -> 7381.11s]  As the fire burns the wood, so too will the light burn away your sin.
[7381.11s -> 7386.39s]  I mean, I'm fire, so...
[7386.39s -> 7394.05s]  Let's do it.
[7394.05s -> 7401.86s]  Okay, let's inscribe fear into the wood, anger, pride, greed, or just scribble all over it.
[7401.86s -> 7404.46s]  I don't think I want to do this because what if I write something...
[7404.46s -> 7412.46s]  I don't know what it says and it's something really bad and I don't want to, like, have that be burnt into my character.
[7412.46s -> 7415.69s]  Hmm. No.
[7415.69s -> 7420.92s]  Hmm. Hmm.
[7421.00s -> 7421.72s]  Greed.
[7421.72s -> 7428.23s]  Greed.
[7428.23s -> 7438.90s]  That means I get extra gold for kill, right?
[7438.90s -> 7441.22s]  It's probably some bonus, right? It's probably a money bonus.
[7441.22s -> 7447.19s]  Good. You must feel as though a great weight has been lifted from you.
[7447.19s -> 7453.90s]  Welcome to Kyova Shard.
[7453.90s -> 7461.41s]  Okay.
[7461.41s -> 7466.89s]  Well, a man that old has lived through some dark days.
[7466.89s -> 7468.33s]  Explains why he's so cross.
[7468.33s -> 7469.69s]  Doesn't do anything?
[7469.69s -> 7474.26s]  Oh, there.
[7474.26s -> 7479.38s]  Okay, it's time to take a BRB because I'm going to come back and I'm going to give you a little bit of Grotto Beast's info.
[7479.38s -> 7484.39s]  Not long. Just going to give you a couple of quick little pieces of information.
[7484.39s -> 7488.41s]  It'll take literally two minutes.
[7488.41s -> 7490.93s]  And by that I mean I'll be back. I'm not leaving yet.
[7490.93s -> 7497.13s]  I'm going to leave in about 20 minutes.
[7497.13s -> 7501.77s]  So just be aware that in like 20 minutes I'm going to leave and then I'll come back with some info.
[7501.77s -> 7505.97s]  There you go. Sorry about that. I had it completely wrong.
[7505.97s -> 7508.89s]  It's my fault. What a bad announcement.
[7508.89s -> 7513.11s]  So what did you write on that piece of wood?
[7513.11s -> 7517.51s]  Something about greed or gluttony perhaps?
[7517.51s -> 7522.34s]  It matters little, I suppose.
[7522.34s -> 7523.14s]  Where are you going?
[7523.14s -> 7527.15s]  I'm off to the dry steps in search of that pale man from your vision.
[7527.15s -> 7532.47s]  I must know what party plays in all this.
[7532.47s -> 7536.91s]  But first, I need you to retrieve something of mine while I finish my negotiations.
[7536.91s -> 7539.31s]  A merchant in the center of the city has it.
[7539.31s -> 7551.94s]  Just tell him I sent you.
[7551.94s -> 7565.40s]  Stable merchant. Give me one sec.
[7565.40s -> 7567.80s]  Drink water. I've got a big ass water right here.
[7567.80s -> 7571.16s]  I've been drinking it the whole time.
[7571.16s -> 7587.76s]  When I go BRB, I'll refill the water. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'm good.
[7587.76s -> 7602.39s]  I'm hydrated. I promise.
[7602.39s -> 7614.94s]  OK. The mod said do slash dance.
[7614.94s -> 7622.90s]  Really? I didn't do anything.
[7622.90s -> 7626.29s]  Pratoos. Sway back.
[7626.29s -> 7634.78s]  And somewhere else to get warm. I was here first.
[7634.78s -> 7641.23s]  OK, so this is this seems like a big hub town then.
[7641.27s -> 7648.51s]  Got you. OK, wait, waypoint.
[7648.51s -> 7654.53s]  Our waypoints. What about town portals?
[7654.53s -> 7665.47s]  Elections, plan, majority clan.
[7665.47s -> 7667.70s]  Oh, wait, this is blacksmith.
[7667.70s -> 7670.14s]  Waypoints allow you to fast travel freely across Sanctuary.
[7670.14s -> 7672.90s]  Yep. Activate them.
[7672.90s -> 7678.11s]  You can earn renown by completing various activities across the continent.
[7678.11s -> 7680.67s]  Obtaining renown will grant rewards and certain thresholds.
[7680.67s -> 7687.98s]  View the status of your renown for each region from the map.
[7687.98s -> 7689.30s]  What will it be?
[7689.30s -> 7695.62s]  All right, so I can salvage just all junk.
[7695.62s -> 7699.74s]  And imagining this means that it's just unlocks new look on a salvage.
[7699.74s -> 7720.19s]  Oh, OK. Is that a stupid idea?
[7720.19s -> 7727.44s]  All right, let's just salvage this.
[7727.44s -> 7734.90s]  Oh, there we go. This is better.
[7734.90s -> 7736.66s]  Is it, though? No, it's not.
[7736.66s -> 7738.74s]  I want the willpower.
[7738.74s -> 7740.22s]  Came apart nicely.
[7740.22s -> 7747.00s]  OK. Prepare.
[7747.00s -> 7755.46s]  Upgrade. Can't really do anything here yet.
[7755.46s -> 7757.70s]  If you press P, you'll P.
[7757.74s -> 7762.82s]  That's made up and is an incredibly immature thing to say.
[7762.82s -> 7771.82s]  In fact, that's just that's just a very immature thing for you to say.
[7771.82s -> 7779.95s]  I'm not going to tolerate that.
[7779.95s -> 7785.34s]  Preveyor of curiosities.
[7785.34s -> 7789.52s]  Twenty five of this.
[7789.52s -> 7793.47s]  The curiosity is this gambling?
[7793.47s -> 7795.07s]  How do I get this? OK, this is gold.
[7795.07s -> 7798.11s]  This is red dot PVP.
[7798.11s -> 7799.51s]  And this is all balls.
[7799.51s -> 7803.40s]  How do I get those?
[7803.40s -> 7813.28s]  An in-game currency.
[7813.32s -> 7817.41s]  OK, I don't think I'm going to buy or do anything.
[7817.41s -> 7825.24s]  What's that like a random event?
[7825.24s -> 7826.16s]  How fair is the city guard?
[7826.16s -> 7829.64s]  The new militia recruits have been training night and day.
[7829.64s -> 7830.68s]  They deserve.
[7830.68s -> 7834.24s]  I I need to know what's going on here.
[7834.24s -> 7835.44s]  Hold on. I need to know what's going on.
[7835.44s -> 7837.52s]  Giving them a cheer for me.
[7837.52s -> 7838.40s]  Easy going for you.
[7838.40s -> 7839.20s]  I need to know what's going on.
[7839.20s -> 7840.68s]  Confidence for the recruits.
[7840.68s -> 7844.04s]  And I get to go on being the hardest.
[7844.04s -> 7845.80s]  What's going on right now?
[7845.80s -> 7858.84s]  I will. OK, this is a side quest.
[7858.84s -> 7860.44s]  What's happening here?
[7860.44s -> 7868.16s]  OK, so this is a little side quest.
[7868.16s -> 7873.02s]  There are side quests in Diablo four.
[7873.02s -> 7877.84s]  Hold on. OK, never mind.
[7877.84s -> 7881.39s]  It's nothing. Never mind.
[7881.39s -> 7886.65s]  Fossil arm fossil arm.
[7886.65s -> 7889.69s]  I got a little distracted. What was I doing here?
[7889.69s -> 7891.33s]  Let us in on the joke. I don't know.
[7891.33s -> 7892.33s]  I got distracted. All right.
[7892.33s -> 7894.91s]  What was going on here?
[7894.91s -> 7900.57s]  Cheer at the training area.
[7900.57s -> 7910.77s]  Oh, cheer E.
[7910.77s -> 7929.25s]  Oh, there is a dance.
[7929.25s -> 7933.91s]  Is there a dance?
[7933.91s -> 7942.02s]  There's no dance. What?
[7942.02s -> 7949.38s]  Well done. Hello.
[7949.38s -> 7952.74s]  You are courting pain at death.
[7952.74s -> 7958.30s]  It's kind of a dance.
[7958.30s -> 7961.28s]  Thanks. I hope they don't get used to it.
[7966.26s -> 7968.87s]  I guess I'm renowned.
[7968.87s -> 7969.87s]  What's that?
[7969.87s -> 7972.03s]  Is that a oh, I got like a loot chest.
[7972.99s -> 7975.43s]  Oh, an herb cache.
[7975.43s -> 7999.56s]  Let's open it back to Nancy.
[7999.56s -> 8003.24s]  You crashed the server when I crashed the server.
[8003.97s -> 8011.94s]  No, I didn't.
[8011.94s -> 8018.86s]  I don't think I crashed the whole server.
[8018.86s -> 8023.99s]  All right. What's the queue time?
[8023.99s -> 8027.30s]  I got disconnected, too.
[8027.30s -> 8030.75s]  That means we all got disconnected.
[8030.75s -> 8032.82s]  Twenty one minutes.
[8032.82s -> 8036.73s]  Long enough for us to just go like this.
[8036.73s -> 8040.90s]  And you see it. No, you can't.
[8040.90s -> 8041.66s]  Now you can. All right.
[8041.66s -> 8045.34s]  Let me get this. How do I do this?
[8045.34s -> 8047.62s]  Guess I better get this pawn shoveled off.
[8047.62s -> 8055.70s]  OK. All right.
[8055.70s -> 8059.85s]  So that means that there is one crack.
[8060.81s -> 8062.01s]  So there's one.
[8062.01s -> 8063.53s]  This means there's one crack.
[8063.53s -> 8068.01s]  So that means it has to be here.
[8071.70s -> 8076.57s]  Right. Because it was there before.
[8076.61s -> 8079.75s]  Zero is nothing here.
[8079.75s -> 8081.75s]  But is it adjacent?
[8081.75s -> 8084.15s]  Like it's just one, two or three.
[8084.15s -> 8086.74s]  So they can't be here.
[8086.74s -> 8089.80s]  That means it has to be either here or here.
[8089.80s -> 8091.58s]  I'm going to say here.
[8091.58s -> 8094.46s]  No, that means zero, zero.
[8094.46s -> 8095.77s]  So it has to be right there.
[8095.77s -> 8102.15s]  OK. So now I know.
[8102.15s -> 8119.78s]  There we go. What?
[8119.78s -> 8123.26s]  I have a question. I have a question.
[8123.26s -> 8127.50s]  That means it's zero here, here, here and here.
[8127.50s -> 8129.30s]  Right. That's how my sweep works.
[8129.30s -> 8132.40s]  This is zero here. Right.
[8132.40s -> 8142.12s]  OK. That means it has to be right there.
[8142.12s -> 8155.46s]  I don't play this game.
[8155.46s -> 8162.60s]  Oh, shit. Zero.
[8162.60s -> 8164.48s]  Is it right? Oh, OK.
[8164.48s -> 8177.49s]  All right. Hold on. Zero, zero.
[8177.49s -> 8179.85s]  All eight squares around zero are not mine.
[8179.85s -> 8204.22s]  OK. That's what I thought.
[8204.22s -> 8217.88s]  That just scared the shit out of me.
[8217.88s -> 8221.29s]  They're definitely going to sell dances.
[8221.29s -> 8222.37s]  I don't know what they're going to do.
[8222.37s -> 8242.56s]  I made this way harder on myself for no reason.
[8242.56s -> 8246.30s]  OK. All right.
[8246.30s -> 8250.06s]  So this means there's two.
[8250.06s -> 8259.35s]  That means it has to be one here and one here.
[8259.35s -> 8261.43s]  Has to be.
[8261.47s -> 8263.67s]  This means there has to be one here and here.
[8263.67s -> 8265.07s]  Technically could be the same.
[8265.07s -> 8266.90s]  This one could be here and here.
[8266.90s -> 8274.91s]  This one's two could be here, but also could be here.
[8274.91s -> 8279.74s]  This one is two. One, two has to be there.
[8279.74s -> 8282.43s]  This one is also two. Has to be here.
[8282.43s -> 8293.92s]  Because one, two, one, two has to be.
[8293.92s -> 8296.77s]  What do you mean? No. What do you mean?
[8296.77s -> 8299.49s]  What do you mean? Wrong.
[8299.49s -> 8301.09s]  This has to. This is two.
[8301.09s -> 8303.72s]  So this is one, two.
[8303.72s -> 8306.66s]  It has to be here.
[8306.66s -> 8311.02s]  This is also a two. One, two.
[8311.02s -> 8315.62s]  One, two, one, two, one, two.
[8315.62s -> 8326.42s]  I think this is safe, then.
[8326.42s -> 8328.33s]  These are all one.
[8328.33s -> 8332.18s]  OK, well, this has to be here because nothing else it could be.
[8333.90s -> 8335.60s]  This could be it. This could be it.
[8335.60s -> 8342.81s]  This is a two. Two has to be one.
[8343.47s -> 8347.11s]  But it could be this one here.
[8347.11s -> 8350.53s]  These might be safe. I think they're safe.
[8350.53s -> 8356.46s]  Thank you. I was right.
[8356.46s -> 8358.66s]  Is one. That means this is safe.
[8358.66s -> 8362.90s]  There's another one, right? Wait, no, this is technically.
[8362.90s -> 8365.68s]  It's talking about this one, technically.
[8365.68s -> 8383.07s]  This is safe. Three, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, one.
[8388.30s -> 8390.54s]  You just ditch this and pack a bowl on stream.
[8391.78s -> 8408.28s]  No, dude, I'm playing. I'm busy.
[8408.28s -> 8410.88s]  Oh, shut up. I thought it was talking about this one.
[8412.08s -> 8416.97s]  What? How is it not talking about this one?
[8419.92s -> 8422.53s]  What happened here?
[8422.53s -> 8424.77s]  This is how is it not adjacent?
[8424.77s -> 8426.91s]  What is that's one?
[8426.91s -> 8436.43s]  This one is right. What?
[8436.43s -> 8443.86s]  Who told me to put that cone there?
[8443.86s -> 8457.41s]  One, two, three, one, two, three, one, two.
[8457.41s -> 8460.46s]  It could be one, two, one.
[8478.65s -> 8485.24s]  I just tried to guess.
[8485.24s -> 8490.48s]  OK, if this is just a one, then this is safe.
[8490.48s -> 8497.29s]  One, two, who knows one.
[8497.65s -> 8499.81s]  So it has to be this one or this one.
[8506.32s -> 8508.80s]  One, two, three.
[8508.80s -> 8509.44s]  I don't know. I couldn't.
[8509.44s -> 8512.69s]  I can't get this one.
[8512.69s -> 8513.93s]  You click maps, please.
[8513.93s -> 8516.59s]  No, I mean, I played Minesweeper.
[8516.91s -> 8519.51s]  I don't play Minesweeper. I don't play it.
[8524.94s -> 8534.74s]  Oh, this is wrong. Skill issue.
[8534.74s -> 8536.06s]  Yeah, whatever.
[8536.06s -> 8537.30s]  It can't be skilled at all.
[8537.30s -> 8540.38s]  The things you try to do.
[8540.38s -> 8542.94s]  Hey, you have most of them for you.
[8543.86s -> 8544.42s]  Shut the fuck.
[8544.42s -> 8553.36s]  Ban that person for an hour.
[8553.36s -> 8555.40s]  All right. Let me let's pay attention here.
[8555.40s -> 8558.24s]  So this is these are safe, then
[8558.24s -> 8560.56s]  because this is the only one.
[8560.56s -> 8587.18s]  Here's another zero.
[8587.18s -> 8593.19s]  OK, five, one, two, three, four, five.
[8593.55s -> 8604.86s]  Damn. OK, it's not five.
[8604.86s -> 8606.70s]  Oh, it's four. Shit.
[8606.70s -> 8613.78s]  It is four. Is it one?
[8614.53s -> 8615.49s]  Well, it's it has.
[8615.49s -> 8616.69s]  There's no way it's not here.
[8616.69s -> 8618.89s]  One, two, three. Yeah, it's at least these three.
[8624.12s -> 8625.68s]  Has to be two could be here.
[8625.68s -> 8628.80s]  This has to be one could be there.
[8628.80s -> 8630.00s]  This is three.
[8630.00s -> 8631.92s]  One, two, three, potentially.
[8631.92s -> 8632.96s]  This is three as well.
[8632.96s -> 8637.49s]  One, two now.
[8637.49s -> 8638.61s]  Well, this is one.
[8638.61s -> 8640.54s]  So it has to be there.
[8640.54s -> 8641.90s]  This is also one.
[8641.90s -> 8645.77s]  Therefore, this is safe.
[8645.77s -> 8652.06s]  Therefore, this is safe as well.
[8652.06s -> 8654.06s]  This is this has to be here.
[8657.45s -> 8663.59s]  What are you talking about, bro?
[8663.59s -> 8664.03s]  This is three.
[8664.03s -> 8664.99s]  So one, two, three.
[8664.99s -> 8667.60s]  That means this is safe.
[8667.60s -> 8671.86s]  That means this is safe.
[8671.86s -> 8681.82s]  This is not safe.
[8681.82s -> 8685.90s]  Get off of this nonsense.
[8685.90s -> 8687.14s]  I don't want to do this again.
[8687.14s -> 8688.50s]  So I can look at this.
[8688.50s -> 8690.05s]  My timer.
[8690.05s -> 8691.69s]  How long is that relative?
[8691.69s -> 8694.77s]  Hold on a minute.
[8694.77s -> 8696.97s]  The countdown right now for D4 is 10 minutes.
[8697.76s -> 8700.26s]  It was 21 minutes.
[8700.26s -> 8703.94s]  So this is 10 minutes of time.
[8703.94s -> 8708.74s]  10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.
[8710.47s -> 8712.87s]  This is almost 200 minutes of time.
[8712.87s -> 8715.23s]  This is three hour.
[8715.23s -> 8718.27s]  This is like a two to three hour timer.
[8720.61s -> 8723.01s]  That's a lot of time to do this.
[8726.86s -> 8728.30s]  Is that what that is happening?
[8728.30s -> 8734.07s]  I can't tell.
[8734.07s -> 8736.53s]  All right.
[8736.53s -> 8739.96s]  I'm almost there.
[8739.96s -> 8744.02s]  Two, one, two.
[8744.02s -> 8744.66s]  There's the three.
[8744.66s -> 8745.34s]  One, two, three.
[8745.34s -> 8746.62s]  Therefore, this is safe.
[8746.62s -> 8747.97s]  This game is kind of fun.
[8747.97s -> 8751.35s]  It's kind of reminds me of Picross.
[8751.35s -> 8754.83s]  One, two, three.
[8754.83s -> 8755.43s]  There's the four.
[8755.43s -> 8757.23s]  One, two, three, four.
[8757.23s -> 8763.21s]  This is safe.
[8763.21s -> 8764.09s]  There's your one.
[8764.09s -> 8766.76s]  This is safe.
[8766.76s -> 8770.15s]  This is not safe.
[8770.15s -> 8776.61s]  This is.
[8776.61s -> 8778.09s]  There are three more.
[8778.09s -> 8783.22s]  I think that's that's it.
[8783.22s -> 8794.65s]  It's safe to walk on the ice now.
[8794.65s -> 8796.15s]  I guess not.
[8796.15s -> 8808.58s]  But wait, wait, wait.
[8808.58s -> 8811.46s]  Two, this is not safe.
[8811.46s -> 8812.66s]  How is it safe?
[8812.66s -> 8818.88s]  No, am I missing a square?
[8818.88s -> 8821.28s]  One, two.
[8821.32s -> 8828.11s]  OK, one, two, one, two, one, two.
[8828.11s -> 8836.87s]  Is it this one?
[8836.87s -> 8837.87s]  But I'm on the cracks.
[8837.87s -> 8840.63s]  Oh, that ought to do it.
[8840.63s -> 8842.15s]  Wait a second.
[8842.15s -> 8843.99s]  Those look like wolf tracks.
[8843.99s -> 8847.60s]  Maybe I should find out where they go.
[8847.60s -> 8861.10s]  Wolf tracks.
[8861.10s -> 8861.86s]  Weird.
[8861.86s -> 8863.90s]  Looks like some kind of monument.
[8863.90s -> 8868.30s]  What's this doing here?
[8868.30s -> 8869.38s]  Strange.
[8869.38s -> 8872.04s]  It's halfway in and halfway out.
[8872.04s -> 8883.74s]  This thing must open up somehow.
[8883.74s -> 8892.67s]  I don't know how to open it.
[8892.67s -> 8894.63s]  I don't know what the fuck I just did.
[8903.82s -> 8923.01s]  Let's go back.
[8923.01s -> 8924.61s]  Can I pull this?
[8924.61s -> 8940.57s]  There's got to be something I can pull.
[8940.57s -> 8943.11s]  Chicken Ridge.
[8943.11s -> 8947.02s]  Hey, Chicken Ridge.
[8947.02s -> 8948.98s]  Let's go for it.
[8948.98s -> 8952.41s]  See tracks.
[8952.41s -> 8958.35s]  Sounded like an explosion.
[8958.35s -> 8969.94s]  Why is this wolf throwing grenades?
[8969.94s -> 8970.54s]  What?
[8970.54s -> 8978.90s]  I saw out before I run out of air.
[8978.90s -> 8980.06s]  Oh, God.
[8980.06s -> 8980.78s]  OK.
[8980.78s -> 8982.70s]  I'll never make it.
[8982.70s -> 8984.06s]  I can barely breathe.
[8984.06s -> 8991.98s]  One's up there.
[8991.98s -> 8998.27s]  It's going to be the dog.
[8998.27s -> 9001.70s]  Yeah, that's like that's like that's like a sniffing dog.
[9003.25s -> 9004.09s]  Easy.
[9004.09s -> 9005.41s]  It's OK.
[9005.41s -> 9010.50s]  I'll be about the situation either.
[9010.50s -> 9013.55s]  Quick, just throw a raw turkey out there.
[9013.55s -> 9014.47s]  It's gone.
[9014.47s -> 9017.75s]  But thanks to that hole it dug, I can breathe again.
[9017.75s -> 9020.19s]  Now, if I can just pull myself out.
[9026.85s -> 9034.60s]  OK, well, we got to see the we got to see the wolf.
[9034.60s -> 9045.62s]  That was pretty cool.
[9045.62s -> 9048.10s]  Oh, this is where the grenade went off.
[9048.10s -> 9054.39s]  Awesome.
[9054.39s -> 9062.04s]  Cool.
[9062.04s -> 9067.07s]  Warning, Diablo 4, there was a problem logging in.
[9067.07s -> 9071.32s]  Well, that's not good.
[9071.32s -> 9074.62s]  Oh, that's bad.
[9074.62s -> 9089.77s]  Try it again.
[9089.81s -> 9090.37s]  I'm going to laugh.
[9090.37s -> 9094.09s]  This is like two hours.
[9094.09s -> 9097.02s]  Hey, 15 more minutes to wait.
[9097.02s -> 9098.74s]  That's funny.
[9098.74s -> 9108.21s]  OK, back to Nancy Drew.
[9108.21s -> 9108.81s]  Oh, right.
[9108.81s -> 9110.13s]  I'm going to BRB.
[9110.13s -> 9113.46s]  It's a good time to BRB.
[9113.46s -> 9114.02s]  I'm going to come back.
[9114.02s -> 9116.38s]  I'm going to talk about Grotto Beast very, very quickly.
[9116.38s -> 9121.23s]  A couple of things to let you know.
[9121.23s -> 9123.53s]  Very interesting things.
[9123.53s -> 9129.51s]  I will be right back.
[9129.51s -> 9148.43s]  Just a second.
[9148.43s -> 9153.04s]  I'll be right back.
[9153.04s -> 9404.58s]  I'll be right back.
[9404.58s -> 9405.62s]  OK, let's see.
[9405.62s -> 9407.97s]  Let's see if this works.
[9407.97s -> 9411.53s]  Might not work that well because I'm trying to.
[9411.53s -> 9416.71s]  Holly and I have been trying to like charge it with a little light.
[9416.71s -> 9423.18s]  Let's see.
[9423.18s -> 9426.90s]  I turned my monitors off so I can't see you.
[9426.90s -> 9435.27s]  Hold on.
[9435.27s -> 9437.61s]  Ha ha.
[9437.61s -> 9438.37s]  I'm going to turn this off.
[9438.37s -> 9446.30s]  Let's see if it works.
[9446.30s -> 9449.66s]  Can you see it?
[9449.66s -> 9455.81s]  This is the glow in the dark.
[9455.81s -> 9461.71s]  I got one of the hoodies.
[9461.71s -> 9464.63s]  It probably works better if you charge it in like actual light, light,
[9464.63s -> 9469.78s]  like sunlight.
[9469.78s -> 9475.28s]  What if I do this?
[9475.28s -> 9478.02s]  This is like scary.
[9478.02s -> 9478.50s]  All right, ready?
[9478.50s -> 9480.16s]  I'm going to turn everything off.
[9480.16s -> 9481.00s]  I'm going to stand over there.
[9481.00s -> 9484.88s]  Let's see if it works.
[9484.88s -> 9494.18s]  Can you see me?
[9494.18s -> 9507.62s]  The camera might not be able to pick it up.
[9507.62s -> 9508.62s]  Ow.
[9508.62s -> 9510.29s]  Fuck.
[9510.29s -> 9516.16s]  It just hit my knee so hard.
[9516.16s -> 9518.86s]  Can you see it?
[9518.90s -> 9527.36s]  I can't even tell if you can see it.
[9527.36s -> 9533.17s]  All right, I need to see chat.
[9533.17s -> 9533.89s]  You can't see it.
[9533.89s -> 9537.92s]  Shit.
[9537.92s -> 9543.51s]  We were trying to charge it with this little light.
[9543.51s -> 9548.27s]  It comes up pretty well.
[9548.27s -> 9550.55s]  Bro, get a flashlight.
[9550.55s -> 9555.23s]  Hold on, let me see.
[9555.23s -> 9559.98s]  Usually need some intense sunlight.
[9559.98s -> 9564.43s]  I got this little thing.
[9564.43s -> 9566.67s]  I wanted to show it earlier with the sunlight,
[9566.67s -> 9574.96s]  but I couldn't because you can't really turn the sun off.
[9574.96s -> 9578.74s]  All right, ready?
[9578.74s -> 9581.06s]  This is like a seance.
[9581.06s -> 9582.18s]  I don't like this.
[9582.18s -> 9584.91s]  I'm like, yes.
[9584.91s -> 9588.63s]  All right, ready?
[9588.63s -> 9598.36s]  These are not that bright, unfortunately.
[9598.40s -> 9600.87s]  Boy, is there another solution?
[9600.87s -> 9602.35s]  Hold on.
[9602.35s -> 9607.94s]  Oh, hello.
[9607.94s -> 9611.78s]  No, you're an idiot.
[9611.78s -> 9613.62s]  Oh, Gradovich, I see you.
[9613.62s -> 9614.97s]  Welcome.
[9614.97s -> 9618.41s]  These things are cool.
[9618.41s -> 9621.35s]  Well, I can't really show that well, unfortunately.
[9621.35s -> 9624.36s]  I thought maybe it would work.
[9624.36s -> 9629.31s]  Unfortunately, it's too dark out.
[9629.31s -> 9630.35s]  I can see it pretty well.
[9630.35s -> 9641.61s]  It's not coming through the camera that good.
[9641.61s -> 9646.06s]  You need UV light.
[9646.06s -> 9649.07s]  Still cool.
[9649.07s -> 9653.49s]  I mean, it's glowing, but just not that brightly.
[9653.49s -> 9663.74s]  Yeah, I'll turn the light on so you can see.
[9663.90s -> 9674.26s]  Here's one of the shirts.
[9674.26s -> 9676.04s]  I think it came out pretty good.
[9676.04s -> 9678.66s]  Turn the light back off.
[9678.66s -> 9680.94s]  This is a large, by the way.
[9680.94s -> 9688.39s]  Wait, let me turn this on.
[9688.39s -> 9690.50s]  Hey, there we go.
[9690.50s -> 9695.18s]  So you can see the color better.
[9695.18s -> 9699.16s]  This is a man-sized hoodie, that's right.
[9699.16s -> 9703.00s]  Would you have maybe like a UV light?
[9703.00s -> 9706.00s]  So me and Holly played around with these.
[9706.00s -> 9708.84s]  We got it to work before, but it was daytime,
[9708.84s -> 9711.32s]  so that makes sense.
[9711.32s -> 9712.88s]  It's a comfy hoodie, it is.
[9712.88s -> 9717.26s]  Well, this is a large, so I usually wear mediums.
[9717.26s -> 9719.62s]  Somebody said he's so ugly.
[9719.70s -> 9726.76s]  Shut up.
[9726.76s -> 9731.74s]  Use your phone if you have a black light.
[9731.74s -> 9732.62s]  Why do you look so sweaty?
[9732.62s -> 9734.14s]  Because I am sweaty.
[9734.14s -> 9735.43s]  Oh, let me try something.
[9735.43s -> 9871.17s]  I'll be right back.
[9871.17s -> 9871.99s]  There we go.
[9871.99s -> 9874.28s]  All right, there it is.
[9874.28s -> 9876.24s]  Ha ha ha.
[9876.24s -> 9885.28s]  Wait, why am I using it twice?
[9885.28s -> 9887.60s]  No, the phone light works much better
[9887.60s -> 9889.90s]  than just like a regular light, I wonder why.
[9889.90s -> 9890.74s]  Yeah, this is cool.
[9890.74s -> 9891.62s]  All right, yeah, let's do it.
[9891.62s -> 9894.92s]  Let's see, you ready?
[9894.92s -> 9903.18s]  I gotta turn on my monitors off.
[9903.18s -> 9905.77s]  Okay, here it comes.
[9905.77s -> 9920.35s]  Should be able to see it now.
[9920.35s -> 9924.09s]  Yeah, there it is.
[9924.09s -> 9931.75s]  Can you see it?
[9931.75s -> 9941.18s]  It works.
[9941.18s -> 9942.02s]  Can you see it?
[9942.18s -> 9944.48s]  Is it being picked up by the camera?
[9944.48s -> 9952.42s]  Because it looks great here.
[9952.42s -> 9956.78s]  I don't know if you guys can see it or not.
[9956.78s -> 9959.70s]  You can't see, fuck.
[9959.70s -> 9964.98s]  Well, I assure you, it looks really cool.
[9964.98s -> 9966.10s]  We can't see anything.
[9966.10s -> 9966.94s]  It's the cameras.
[9966.94s -> 9968.64s]  The camera's not good enough.
[9968.64s -> 9972.17s]  We'll take a photo of it.
[9972.17s -> 9973.49s]  But you can see, yeah, you can see it now,
[9973.49s -> 9976.62s]  but I think the camera's not good enough
[9976.62s -> 9980.50s]  to pick up the light.
[9980.50s -> 9982.68s]  We believe you.
[9982.68s -> 9984.02s]  Ha ha.
[9984.02s -> 9987.54s]  I promise it glows, I promise.
[9987.54s -> 9991.00s]  All right, give me one second.
[9991.00s -> 9995.00s]  I think there's too much light in here.
[9996.00s -> 9999.52s]  This is the Cybertruck brick demo.
[9999.52s -> 10001.56s]  No, I swear to God, it is glowing.
[10001.56s -> 10013.62s]  It's just not picking up well on camera.
[10013.62s -> 10024.87s]  There we go, hold on.
[10024.87s -> 10148.90s]  All right, I'm gonna go pee, I'll be right back.
[10148.90s -> 10156.34s]  Okay, well, I wish it showed up.
[10156.34s -> 10157.90s]  We'll take a picture with it
[10157.90s -> 10164.20s]  so we can prove it actually works.
[10164.20s -> 10165.04s]  You didn't just piss?
[10165.04s -> 10176.36s]  Yes, I did.
[10176.36s -> 10180.21s]  I think the issue is that trying to just blast it
[10180.21s -> 10182.70s]  with like a flashlight and then stand in the corner
[10182.70s -> 10186.78s]  with a webcam probably doesn't show it that well.
[10186.78s -> 10188.60s]  We'll take a picture.
[10188.60s -> 10190.64s]  After stream, we'll light it up.
[10190.68s -> 10193.63s]  I'll get into a dark room so you can see it.
[10193.63s -> 10196.87s]  It actually is pretty awesome.
[10196.87s -> 10198.87s]  But anyways, the brick went through the Cybertruck.
[10198.87s -> 10199.95s]  Sorry about that.
[10199.95s -> 10202.81s]  Ha ha ha.
[10202.81s -> 10208.90s]  Keep the blue lighting?
[10208.90s -> 10210.93s]  I missed the Reddit shelf.
[10210.93s -> 10213.09s]  It's okay.
[10213.09s -> 10216.86s]  All right, this will take two minutes.
[10216.86s -> 10220.42s]  Well, it was supposed to take two minutes.
[10220.42s -> 10222.42s]  Also, hey, let me show this.
[10222.42s -> 10231.44s]  Wait, let me just get into Diablo first.
[10231.44s -> 10236.33s]  What's my hair routine?
[10236.33s -> 10240.02s]  It's called use a decent conditioner.
[10240.02s -> 10243.19s]  Don't overwash, all right?
[10243.19s -> 10251.13s]  Don't sit there and just scrub your head for too long.
[10251.17s -> 10257.66s]  Okay, let me do this.
[10257.66s -> 10260.33s]  Nancy Drew is okay.
[10260.33s -> 10262.49s]  She'll be fine.
[10262.49s -> 10268.10s]  Another thing I want to show you real quick.
[10268.10s -> 10270.42s]  We've been getting lots of questions
[10270.42s -> 10273.98s]  about the rules of the game.
[10273.98s -> 10275.58s]  Because I'm sure a lot of you understand
[10275.58s -> 10278.89s]  that it's channel merch first,
[10278.89s -> 10282.76s]  but on top of that, it's also a game.
[10282.76s -> 10285.01s]  And people saying, how does this game play?
[10285.01s -> 10287.98s]  What the hell are you even doing?
[10287.98s -> 10292.46s]  Is this like magic or Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh?
[10292.46s -> 10294.46s]  Like, what can I compare this to?
[10294.46s -> 10297.11s]  And we haven't really given any rules.
[10297.11s -> 10305.59s]  So the game designer has put together a quick start video
[10305.59s -> 10307.94s]  and is ready to watch.
[10307.94s -> 10310.82s]  We're gonna link it into the chat room
[10310.82s -> 10318.97s]  if you want to see how the game is played.
[10318.97s -> 10321.02s]  Why is that person's name glowing?
[10321.02s -> 10323.16s]  What was that?
[10323.16s -> 10326.12s]  That person's name is literally glowing in the chat.
[10326.12s -> 10327.48s]  What was that?
[10327.48s -> 10329.08s]  I can't even find it anymore.
[10329.08s -> 10331.22s]  Am I going crazy?
[10331.22s -> 10337.36s]  What was that?
[10337.36s -> 10341.50s]  Somebody's name was glowing.
[10341.50s -> 10345.65s]  But yeah, we got a video Grotto Beasts
[10345.65s -> 10347.25s]  on the Grotto Beasts YouTube.
[10347.29s -> 10351.79s]  They'll be on listing it, be showing it.
[10351.79s -> 10360.10s]  Probably get a link here in a second.
[10360.10s -> 10371.03s]  Maybe, possibly, eventually.
[10371.03s -> 10372.07s]  They went offline.
[10376.82s -> 10382.15s]  There is again, there is again.
[10382.15s -> 10387.09s]  Stop talking, I wanna see what they're doing.
[10387.09s -> 10389.77s]  But anyways, here is the quick start guide.
[10389.77s -> 10391.81s]  It's only about, it's less than 10 minutes.
[10391.81s -> 10394.29s]  This is not the entire rules of the game.
[10394.29s -> 10396.73s]  This is just telling you how it's played.
[10396.73s -> 10400.01s]  It's showing you some basic tutorials of how it works.
[10400.01s -> 10402.81s]  This is from our game designer.
[10402.85s -> 10406.60s]  It's on the Grotto Beasts YouTube right now.
[10406.60s -> 10409.55s]  Here is the video in question.
[10409.55s -> 10416.45s]  The rules and the FAQ will be up on the site very soon,
[10416.45s -> 10420.17s]  probably in the next two or three days.
[10420.17s -> 10421.41s]  But for those of you that want to know
[10421.41s -> 10426.26s]  exactly what the hell the game portion is, there it is.
[10426.26s -> 10430.67s]  Give you a pretty good idea of how it works.
[10430.67s -> 10433.15s]  And two minutes is up.
[10433.15s -> 10441.11s]  That was a two minute Grotto Beasts talk.
[10441.11s -> 10445.82s]  And from there, also keep in mind,
[10445.82s -> 10447.94s]  some of that merch, the actual apparel,
[10447.94s -> 10453.05s]  like the shirts and stuff is leaving the store soon.
[10453.05s -> 10455.18s]  That glow in the dark hoodie,
[10455.18s -> 10458.72s]  I promise I proved that it will work.
[10458.72s -> 10461.66s]  This webcam just sucks.
[10461.66s -> 10463.75s]  That is going off the store.
[10463.75s -> 10466.64s]  I believe a couple of days,
[10466.64s -> 10475.41s]  we moved it up until like the second or third of April.
[10475.41s -> 10477.57s]  We gave like two or three more days.
[10477.57s -> 10478.65s]  It was gonna be March 31st,
[10478.65s -> 10489.42s]  but now it's like April 2nd, April 3rd.
[10489.42s -> 10494.56s]  I believe the original 40 shirt, the posters,
[10494.56s -> 10498.08s]  and the glow in the dark shirt are all leaving the store
[10498.08s -> 10499.96s]  as of the second or third of April.
[10499.96s -> 10501.08s]  So if you wanna watch the video,
[10501.08s -> 10502.64s]  the quick start guide is there.
[10502.64s -> 10504.92s]  The game portion of the, and there is the two minutes,
[10504.92s -> 10508.60s]  took about 20.
[10508.60s -> 10516.25s]  Very, very cool.
[10516.25s -> 10520.31s]  Thanks for postponing this just for my birthday.
[10520.31s -> 10525.06s]  All right.
[10525.06s -> 10530.10s]  This is the glowing guy.
[10530.10s -> 10531.50s]  Did it even show up at all?
[10531.50s -> 10532.34s]  Could you even see it?
[10532.34s -> 10534.05s]  Cause it was showing up in real life.
[10534.05s -> 10534.89s]  That's unfortunate.
[10534.89s -> 10540.49s]  Oh well.
[10540.49s -> 10556.76s]  All right, let's get back to Diablo.
[10556.76s -> 10563.22s]  You were having a vision.
[10563.22s -> 10565.23s]  Is Nancy Driscoll open?
[10565.23s -> 10572.98s]  I think it is.
[10572.98s -> 10576.32s]  Okay, there we go.
[10576.32s -> 10578.74s]  All right.
[10578.74s -> 10579.84s]  Missed my camera.
[10579.84s -> 10581.37s]  There it is.
[10581.37s -> 10585.49s]  I look a little sweaty.
[10585.49s -> 10586.82s]  All right.
[10586.82s -> 10589.86s]  For the inevitable next crash, I'm ready.
[10589.86s -> 10594.22s]  We have the fossil in view.
[10594.22s -> 10595.46s]  I didn't even get a water.
[10595.46s -> 10598.06s]  Shit.
[10598.06s -> 10603.02s]  I'll be here in like 10 more minutes.
[10603.02s -> 10606.06s]  Is this fun?
[10606.06s -> 10607.54s]  I can't tell you.
[10607.54s -> 10612.90s]  I can't tell you.
[10612.90s -> 10616.46s]  I'm not allowed to tell you.
[10616.46s -> 10620.38s]  Maybe in an hour or two, I will give you my real opinions.
[10620.38s -> 10627.62s]  I'll give you my real thoughts.
[10627.62s -> 10629.20s]  Didn't I already talk to him?
[10629.20s -> 10630.50s]  Oh, it's cause the game crashed.
[10630.50s -> 10631.62s]  Right, right, right, right, right.
[10631.62s -> 10634.61s]  So what did you write on that piece of wood?
[10634.61s -> 10636.85s]  I'm off to the dry steps and something about green.
[10636.85s -> 10637.69s]  All right, here we go.
[10637.85s -> 10640.33s]  Crack twos, sway back.
[10640.33s -> 10641.65s]  You hate the game?
[10642.93s -> 10643.77s]  Stop saying that.
[10643.77s -> 10650.43s]  It's gonna make me look bad.
[10650.43s -> 10658.11s]  I'm enjoying it so far.
[10658.11s -> 10660.03s]  So the old man's finally decided to fight back.
[10660.03s -> 10662.50s]  Can you rush me to level three?
[10662.50s -> 10666.00s]  Knowing him, he didn't mention coin, did he?
[10668.94s -> 10672.06s]  If he wants his weapon, you will need to pay.
[10676.35s -> 10679.93s]  Okay.
[10679.93s -> 10681.13s]  Lorath's polearm.
[10681.13s -> 10683.01s]  This shit was 20 bucks.
[10683.01s -> 10684.09s]  How is that cheaper?
[10684.77s -> 10687.10s]  So this is like kind of embarrassing.
[10687.10s -> 10697.30s]  20 cents and the next thing you got is 1500.
[10697.30s -> 10701.30s]  Wait, the old man sold me this too.
[10701.30s -> 10702.98s]  Said he didn't need it anymore,
[10702.98s -> 10707.44s]  but I think he'd want it back all the same.
[10707.44s -> 10708.54s]  No charge.
[10712.82s -> 10718.13s]  Okay.
[10718.13s -> 10735.60s]  Strange amulet.
[10735.60s -> 10737.98s]  What is Nancy's funeral?
[10737.98s -> 10741.36s]  Ah, apologies.
[10741.36s -> 10744.11s]  He also gave me this amulet.
[10744.11s -> 10745.55s]  What is it?
[10745.55s -> 10748.43s]  The mark of the Haradrim,
[10748.47s -> 10751.59s]  an ancient order of scholars and mages
[10751.59s -> 10755.26s]  sworn to protect sanctuary from demons.
[10755.26s -> 10758.44s]  These days we are few in number.
[10758.44s -> 10759.28s]  There is another.
[10759.28s -> 10762.00s]  This game should have a hypothermia meter.
[10762.00s -> 10764.38s]  His breadth of knowledge about demons
[10764.38s -> 10770.86s]  is equal only to his hubris.
[10770.86s -> 10774.74s]  Sounds like he could help us.
[10774.74s -> 10776.06s]  You should seek him out in Scotland.
[10776.06s -> 10777.58s]  When are you gonna shave your head on stream?
[10777.58s -> 10779.18s]  But don't forget about the cathedral.
[10779.18s -> 10781.10s]  He's like, near, near.
[10781.10s -> 10783.50s]  And they might prove to be useful allies too.
[10783.50s -> 10786.02s]  You're not coming with me.
[10786.02s -> 10787.26s]  I'm going to the dry steps
[10787.26s -> 10789.78s]  to find out who that pale man is.
[10789.78s -> 10790.74s]  Join me when you can.
[10790.74s -> 10793.68s]  Just be careful.
[10793.68s -> 10797.40s]  Your ties to Lilith, the visions you see.
[10797.40s -> 10799.40s]  You are the key to finding her
[10799.40s -> 10801.24s]  and stopping whatever she has planned.
[10803.84s -> 10808.86s]  There it is.
[10808.86s -> 10813.38s]  Sometimes our paths in life are set to collide.
[10813.38s -> 10816.90s]  We just don't know it.
[10816.90s -> 10820.42s]  Whether it is by accident or fate's hand,
[10820.46s -> 10824.01s]  there is nothing we can do about it.
[10824.01s -> 10826.95s]  The wanderer lost in the storm,
[10826.95s -> 10834.98s]  fed the blood of Lilith, saved by a lone monk.
[10834.98s -> 10839.05s]  Different lives and incidents drawn together.
[10839.05s -> 10840.94s]  By what?
[10840.94s -> 10844.22s]  I like listening to this voice.
[10844.22s -> 10845.06s]  I want this guy to read a book.
[10845.06s -> 10853.75s]  Or some greater power pulling the strings.
[10853.75s -> 10856.86s]  At the time, I thought I had the chance
[10856.86s -> 10862.91s]  to protect humanity from the daughter of hatred.
[10862.91s -> 10865.39s]  The wanderer's connection to her gave me hope.
[10866.47s -> 10872.94s]  Imagine that.
[10872.94s -> 10883.75s]  Okay.
[10883.75s -> 10885.75s]  So now this is like, hey, the world has opened up.
[10885.75s -> 10896.70s]  Now go pretty much everywhere.
[10896.70s -> 10899.22s]  Oh, this is like, hey, you're almost at the end of the demo.
[10899.22s -> 10900.98s]  Like Mario's about to pop in and be like,
[10900.98s -> 10903.43s]  that's enough, next player, please.
[10903.43s -> 10906.69s]  Okay.
[10906.69s -> 10908.05s]  Locations tab.
[10908.05s -> 10914.04s]  You purchased items?
[10914.04s -> 10915.84s]  You have a wardrobe, all right.
[10915.84s -> 10917.58s]  Okay.
[10917.58s -> 10919.30s]  So you can buy emotes.
[10919.30s -> 10920.94s]  Wait, is that it?
[10920.94s -> 10923.82s]  Oh, I thought that actually was the end of the beta.
[10923.82s -> 10926.10s]  I was like, that's not right, right?
[10926.10s -> 10928.18s]  I was like, hold on a minute, what's happening?
[10928.18s -> 10929.46s]  I thought I just got Mario.
[10929.46s -> 10931.22s]  I really thought that's what just happened.
[10931.22s -> 10933.97s]  Okay, we're good.
[10933.97s -> 10937.71s]  Aren't I in the beta right now?
[10937.71s -> 10946.58s]  Okay, we're good.
[10946.58s -> 10948.49s]  Okay.
[10948.49s -> 10953.01s]  Open your journal to view active quests.
[10953.01s -> 10960.88s]  Not Q.
[10960.88s -> 10964.52s]  Okay.
[10964.52s -> 10966.48s]  Travel to the Cathedral of Light.
[10966.48s -> 10969.62s]  I think that's the one I'm gonna do.
[10969.62s -> 10977.75s]  Pin activities on the map with right click.
[10977.75s -> 10979.78s]  I think it already is pinned, right?
[10979.78s -> 10989.69s]  That is.
[10989.69s -> 10990.53s]  Should I do this?
[10990.53s -> 10991.37s]  I mean, do I really need to?
[10991.37s -> 10993.40s]  I probably shouldn't even do these.
[10993.40s -> 10994.24s]  Yes.
[10994.24s -> 10995.60s]  Beta's probably gonna get shut off anyway.
[10995.60s -> 10999.24s]  I wonder if this progress go through the beta?
[10999.24s -> 11000.08s]  I doubt it.
[11000.08s -> 11001.36s]  Perhaps you could sweep the roads
[11001.36s -> 11003.56s]  and see what's taking him so long.
[11003.56s -> 11006.86s]  The cathedral must receive its dues.
[11006.86s -> 11010.95s]  It doesn't, okay.
[11010.95s -> 11033.64s]  Yeah, we'll just do the main thing then.
[11033.64s -> 11035.28s]  Why does cilantro taste like soap?
[11036.40s -> 11037.96s]  Cilantro is good.
[11037.96s -> 11039.20s]  I think, aren't there certain people
[11039.20s -> 11041.60s]  that have like a genetic code in their body
[11041.60s -> 11046.15s]  that makes it so it tastes gross to them?
[11046.15s -> 11048.95s]  We were born in sin.
[11048.95s -> 11052.28s]  Children of darkness.
[11052.28s -> 11055.28s]  The Father's light can be sought
[11055.28s -> 11059.50s]  through penitence and faith.
[11059.50s -> 11064.87s]  Walk in the light.
[11064.87s -> 11065.71s]  What is going on here?
[11065.71s -> 11068.11s]  We must be ever vigilant against sin, brother.
[11068.11s -> 11069.55s]  Yes, Reverend Mother.
[11069.55s -> 11070.39s]  Cilantro fall?
[11070.39s -> 11071.35s]  With the light of an aria.
[11071.35s -> 11072.19s]  Actually, do it.
[11072.19s -> 11073.03s]  I'm curious.
[11073.03s -> 11073.87s]  Burden away wickedness.
[11073.87s -> 11076.99s]  Let not temptation lead you from his holy radiance.
[11076.99s -> 11079.67s]  Do you think cilantro tastes
[11079.67s -> 11081.83s]  like awful?
[11081.83s -> 11082.67s]  Yes or no?
[11082.67s -> 11085.31s]  Here's the percentage of people there.
[11085.31s -> 11088.95s]  Cast out thine darkness for only light must remain.
[11090.31s -> 11092.83s]  Is this the one from the vest?
[11092.83s -> 11095.50s]  Yes, Reverend Mother.
[11095.50s -> 11097.38s]  Did Lorath not accompany you?
[11098.30s -> 11100.81s]  He sent me on without him.
[11100.81s -> 11103.97s]  Putting faith in that old man was a mistake.
[11103.97s -> 11108.46s]  What could possibly be of greater import?
[11108.46s -> 11110.89s]  Lilith.
[11110.89s -> 11120.81s]  So, you know, we have received word from one of our knights
[11120.81s -> 11123.93s]  of a demon sighting in Gale Valley.
[11123.93s -> 11126.29s]  The description matches too closely
[11126.29s -> 11127.85s]  to the sighting in the vest.
[11127.85s -> 11128.69s]  I can't really help that yet.
[11128.69s -> 11133.18s]  If you travel to Yalesi and take stock of your events there,
[11133.18s -> 11137.34s]  you would have the gratitude of the Cathedral of Light.
[11137.34s -> 11139.62s]  I had thought to send Lorath, but.
[11139.62s -> 11143.06s]  Again, he fails in his duty.
[11143.06s -> 11148.43s]  With or without Lorath, the will of Inaris shall be done.
[11156.05s -> 11160.65s]  Here, take the knight's report before you go.
[11160.65s -> 11165.48s]  Let's go.
[11165.48s -> 11168.00s]  Reverend Mother, I received a report
[11168.00s -> 11170.20s]  of a potential demon sighting.
[11170.20s -> 11173.32s]  Horned woman near Yalesna Mines
[11173.32s -> 11175.16s]  performed routine inspection.
[11175.16s -> 11176.12s]  Nothing yet.
[11177.24s -> 11179.56s]  Sent in priest and escort of knights.
[11179.56s -> 11180.40s]  Oh, most of the next step.
[11180.40s -> 11182.76s]  We'll report in when we find something.
[11191.58s -> 11193.14s]  Remember, you banned my grandmother.
[11193.14s -> 11196.64s]  We'll tell your grandmother to chill the fuck out.
[11196.64s -> 11198.16s]  Tell your grandmother to stop fucking screaming
[11198.16s -> 11213.00s]  awful shit in the chat then.
[11213.00s -> 11216.00s]  Baste granny.
[11216.00s -> 11217.64s]  Go open up your granny's chat logs
[11217.64s -> 11224.28s]  and see like the wacky ass shit granny's been saying.
[11224.28s -> 11228.98s]  So 72% say it tastes good.
[11228.98s -> 11233.23s]  That's a lot of people that said it tastes awful.
[11233.23s -> 11241.25s]  28%.
[11241.25s -> 11252.90s]  That seems kind of high, doesn't it?
[11252.90s -> 11262.37s]  I'm out of mana.
[11262.37s -> 11264.93s]  You don't have to have the gene to not like cilantro.
[11264.93s -> 11266.09s]  That's true.
[11266.09s -> 11268.16s]  That's true.
[11268.16s -> 11269.72s]  I'm low on precious mana.
[11270.72s -> 11271.56s]  What just hurt?
[11271.56s -> 11282.73s]  Bad.
[11282.73s -> 11288.54s]  Definitely helped though.
[11288.54s -> 11299.15s]  I lack the needed mana.
[11299.15s -> 11304.86s]  Hog wizard gameplay.
[11304.86s -> 11315.39s]  I wonder how many people are playing as the other classes.
[11315.39s -> 11316.23s]  Kill the animals.
[11324.86s -> 11325.78s]  Event joined.
[11325.78s -> 11327.06s]  Caravan under siege.
[11327.06s -> 11328.14s]  Slay the enemies.
[11328.14s -> 11334.41s]  Oh, okay.
[11334.41s -> 11359.17s]  Be careful.
[11359.17s -> 11360.17s]  How much time?
[11360.17s -> 11363.24s]  Oh, it's like a minute.
[11363.24s -> 11365.52s]  Am I destroying the caravans accidentally?
[11367.17s -> 11368.01s]  Shit.
[11371.85s -> 11385.32s]  I'm not quite prepared for this.
[11385.32s -> 11387.60s]  I should have bought two more spells.
[11387.60s -> 11393.55s]  I'm low on precious mana.
[11393.55s -> 11397.63s]  I'm taking a lighter and just going like click, click, click.
[11397.63s -> 11410.67s]  Any potion?
[11410.67s -> 11411.75s]  Oh my God.
[11411.75s -> 11412.59s]  Come on, man.
[11428.15s -> 11429.03s]  There we go.
[11429.03s -> 11430.75s]  Wouldn't have made it without you.
[11437.26s -> 11439.10s]  Ooh, I got some orbs.
[11439.10s -> 11441.50s]  Gain all those by completing events and spend them.
[11441.50s -> 11443.69s]  Okay, so that's cool.
[11443.73s -> 11447.20s]  So that's how you get those.
[11447.20s -> 11457.46s]  I got a rare.
[11457.46s -> 11461.46s]  Stop biting your lip.
[11461.46s -> 11476.34s]  Cold, shadow resist, five dex.
[11476.34s -> 11482.11s]  Boring Barry.
[11482.11s -> 11483.55s]  Boring Barry, should I continue?
[11483.55s -> 11491.46s]  Boring Barry.
[11491.46s -> 11497.41s]  I'm doing it.
[11497.41s -> 11518.41s]  It just does too much damage to not do it.
[11518.41s -> 11520.34s]  Where's Nancy?
[11520.34s -> 11524.62s]  Nancy only appears when there's a problem with this game.
[11524.62s -> 11525.62s]  And it's been pretty frequent,
[11525.62s -> 11527.66s]  so I'm sure we'll check in with her soon.
[11559.02s -> 11564.81s]  Am I not allowed down here?
[11564.81s -> 11568.33s]  Is the wind blowing too far?
[11569.21s -> 11571.18s]  The winds are blowing.
[11571.18s -> 11583.88s]  How do I stop the wind from blowing?
[11583.88s -> 11585.72s]  Oh, it's not supposed to be happening.
[11600.70s -> 11608.24s]  Nancy, how are you?
[11608.24s -> 11617.84s]  Nancy?
[11617.84s -> 11619.20s]  All right, I'm gonna get some water.
[11619.20s -> 11621.70s]  I'll be right back.
[11621.70s -> 11623.42s]  We'll get Nancy up here and I'm gonna,
[11623.42s -> 11624.26s]  give me one second.
[11624.26s -> 11935.98s]  Let me get some water.
[11935.98s -> 11938.78s]  Sorry, I had to redo my queue.
[11938.78s -> 11947.50s]  Okay, hello.
[11947.50s -> 11952.82s]  So where were we?
[11952.82s -> 11960.94s]  Nancy and I were digging up fossils.
[11960.94s -> 11963.61s]  Oh shit, this, no.
[11963.61s -> 11964.45s]  No, we're good, we're good.
[11964.45s -> 11975.56s]  Do I have to take like a picture of this or no?
[11975.56s -> 11978.75s]  This must've been made by the explosion I heard.
[11978.75s -> 11983.31s]  Should I go back and tell them that the dog is real?
[11983.31s -> 11985.47s]  Go back to Chicken Ridge and risk getting caught
[11985.47s -> 11986.83s]  in another avalanche?
[11986.83s -> 11992.07s]  I don't think so.
[11992.07s -> 11996.13s]  Is this like a sprint back and yell like,
[11996.13s -> 11998.05s]  the dog is real, the dog is real.
[11998.05s -> 12003.44s]  Did they believe us?
[12003.44s -> 12007.05s]  The dog is real.
[12007.05s -> 12028.61s]  Yeah, that might make you look a little weird.
[12028.61s -> 12033.00s]  Did I even get any items or anything?
[12033.00s -> 12034.40s]  It's like lunchtime, right?
[12036.09s -> 12041.13s]  Warm again.
[12041.17s -> 12043.01s]  They were the two guys playing that chess game
[12043.01s -> 12047.59s]  or whatever it was, right?
[12047.59s -> 12058.47s]  Where were those guys?
[12058.47s -> 12069.62s]  Cause they were like, oh, I gotta make burgers?
[12069.62s -> 12071.34s]  Avoid overcooking anything on the griddle
[12071.34s -> 12074.97s]  or in a frying pan, fire may result.
[12074.97s -> 12076.81s]  Guests may order French toast and omelet
[12076.81s -> 12078.29s]  or Canadian bacon.
[12078.29s -> 12079.37s]  French toast and Canadian bacon
[12079.37s -> 12080.73s]  should be cooked on the griddle.
[12080.73s -> 12090.50s]  Omelets, well, it's not breakfast anymore, it's lunch.
[12090.50s -> 12092.22s]  Hamburgers or quesadilla.
[12092.22s -> 12093.66s]  Put hamburger patties on the griddle
[12093.66s -> 12095.74s]  and remove them from the griddle when they are dark brown
[12095.74s -> 12098.78s]  to ensure that they have been thoroughly cooked.
[12099.42s -> 12102.18s]  Put the cooked hamburger patty on the bun first
[12102.18s -> 12103.98s]  and any extra ingredients.
[12106.16s -> 12110.08s]  So dark brown, put it down first, then any extras.
[12110.08s -> 12112.72s]  Quesadilla, put the tortilla into which cheese
[12112.72s -> 12116.21s]  has already been folded in a frying pan.
[12116.21s -> 12118.21s]  Never on the griddle.
[12118.21s -> 12119.53s]  Remove the quesadilla from the pan
[12119.53s -> 12121.37s]  when it has been lightly browned.
[12125.01s -> 12125.85s]  They'll put it in the frying pan.
[12125.85s -> 12129.62s]  Don't, and just remove it when it's been browned.
[12129.66s -> 12133.41s]  All right, are we ordering food or what?
[12133.41s -> 12138.30s]  You want a quesadilla and one hamburger.
[12138.30s -> 12139.82s]  Something don't look right.
[12139.82s -> 12141.30s]  Do this one again.
[12141.30s -> 12142.75s]  What?
[12142.75s -> 12146.27s]  Oh, shit, sorry, I handed you an empty plate.
[12146.27s -> 12150.04s]  All right, you want one hamburger,
[12150.04s -> 12152.12s]  two cheese, one lettuce, two pickle, one tomato.
[12152.12s -> 12156.98s]  Onion, wait, is this, okay, you want two cheese,
[12156.98s -> 12159.14s]  one lettuce, two pickle, one tomato.
[12159.14s -> 12165.68s]  Two cheese, one, two cheese,
[12166.12s -> 12177.58s]  two cheese, one lettuce, two pickle, two cheese.
[12177.58s -> 12178.86s]  Now what?
[12178.86s -> 12180.70s]  Where do I put it?
[12180.70s -> 12181.54s]  Where do I put it?
[12181.54s -> 12183.74s]  Where did I just put that meat?
[12183.74s -> 12186.02s]  Where did I, oh, okay, well, somebody's gonna find that
[12186.02s -> 12187.38s]  at some point.
[12187.38s -> 12192.82s]  How do I put it on a plate?
[12192.82s -> 12199.40s]  Two cheese, oh, son of a, god damn it.
[12200.92s -> 12203.24s]  I, all right, I thought I was looking for a plate.
[12203.24s -> 12208.43s]  I didn't, I thought, all right, two cheese,
[12208.43s -> 12219.58s]  one lettuce, two pickle, one tomato,
[12219.58s -> 12225.73s]  and then ketchup, okay?
[12230.58s -> 12232.50s]  It looks like fucking dog shit.
[12233.47s -> 12238.49s]  Order up.
[12238.49s -> 12243.67s]  All right, you just want a quesadilla.
[12243.67s -> 12246.14s]  You don't, do you want anything on it?
[12246.14s -> 12252.29s]  No.
[12252.29s -> 12254.62s]  Order up.
[12254.62s -> 12255.66s]  One quesadilla.
[12265.32s -> 12267.30s]  Order up.
[12267.30s -> 12269.18s]  One, two cheese, all right.
[12295.58s -> 12299.42s]  This messes the hamburger patties like in the onion tray.
[12299.42s -> 12300.30s]  The person should be like, all right,
[12300.30s -> 12302.06s]  you're trolling the restaurant, you're fired.
[12302.90s -> 12303.74s]  Like, stop.
[12303.74s -> 12304.94s]  Like, why did you do that?
[12304.94s -> 12306.58s]  I don't know, I thought it was funny for the internet.
[12306.58s -> 12307.82s]  All right, well, sorry, but like,
[12307.82s -> 12311.26s]  what the hell are you doing?
[12311.26s -> 12315.71s]  It's been buried at the bottom.
[12315.71s -> 12318.51s]  All right, what do you want on these?
[12318.51s -> 12324.50s]  Cheese, lettuce, pickles.
[12324.50s -> 12325.94s]  Shit.
[12325.94s -> 12331.49s]  Nope, this one's two cheese, two lettuce, one pickle.
[12331.49s -> 12337.30s]  One tomato, two onion, okay?
[12337.30s -> 12344.31s]  One ketchup.
[12344.31s -> 12346.48s]  Order up.
[12346.48s -> 12353.98s]  Two cheese, one lettuce, two pickle.
[12353.98s -> 12364.57s]  One tomato, mustard, ketchup.
[12364.57s -> 12366.08s]  Order up.
[12366.08s -> 12367.12s]  And then you want two things.
[12367.12s -> 12369.80s]  You want one burger, one quesadilla.
[12369.80s -> 12377.66s]  One cheese, two pickle, one tomato.
[12377.66s -> 12383.54s]  One mustard, ketchup.
[12383.54s -> 12385.14s]  And a quesadilla.
[12385.14s -> 12392.22s]  This one's for me.
[12392.22s -> 12417.50s]  That easy.
[12417.50s -> 12426.23s]  Hey, there we go.
[12426.23s -> 12427.59s]  I'm low on precious mana.
[12441.21s -> 12442.77s]  Bro, what?
[12442.77s -> 12444.45s]  Anytime I'm gonna queue for Diablo 4,
[12444.45s -> 12449.22s]  I play Nancy Drew.
[12449.22s -> 12458.99s]  Out of mana, once again.
[12458.99s -> 12460.59s]  I'm gonna like play Nancy Drew, though.
[12460.59s -> 12462.43s]  Like, I'm like feeling that right now.
[12473.63s -> 12474.91s]  All right, let me get to the end of this
[12474.91s -> 12495.19s]  and we'll go back to Nancy Drew for a little bit.
[12495.19s -> 12496.19s]  I do like this, though.
[12496.19s -> 12498.45s]  I probably, this would probably be like,
[12498.45s -> 12500.82s]  probably play this like on a chill stream
[12500.82s -> 12503.50s]  when it actually releases or maybe next week or something.
[12503.50s -> 12504.94s]  What do you need?
[12504.94s -> 12507.22s]  Because I actually do like it.
[12507.22s -> 12509.56s]  I'm looking for Viggo.
[12509.56s -> 12512.64s]  You and that nuisance of a child both.
[12512.64s -> 12516.66s]  Girl's been nagging us about a demon woman all week.
[12516.66s -> 12519.30s]  Viggo's gone, looking into her claims.
[12519.30s -> 12522.98s]  He should be at the mining camp north of here.
[12522.98s -> 12526.42s]  All escort of knights went missing there last week,
[12526.42s -> 12528.82s]  along with the girl's mother and another woman.
[12528.82s -> 12529.66s]  Like Grim Dawn?
[12529.66s -> 12532.50s]  I played Grim Dawn when it was in early access
[12532.50s -> 12534.22s]  up to, I believe, Act Three.
[12536.00s -> 12548.93s]  I played it a long time ago.
[12548.93s -> 12554.32s]  Waypoint.
[12554.32s -> 12557.76s]  Map is actually really big.
[12557.76s -> 12561.14s]  I wonder if it's just this or if it's any more.
[12561.14s -> 12564.64s]  This is actually pretty large.
[12564.64s -> 12565.48s]  Pretty cool.
[12582.26s -> 12587.77s]  I can't, wait, can I afford this?
[12587.77s -> 12597.59s]  Not much.
[12597.59s -> 12601.78s]  The mining camp, let me just see what these things are.
[12601.82s -> 12605.46s]  I provide a steady supply of, shall we say,
[12605.46s -> 12608.54s]  specimens for the clergy nearby.
[12608.54s -> 12611.94s]  However, the desire for knowledge has become more dangerous
[12611.94s -> 12614.21s]  to satisfy.
[12614.21s -> 12617.05s]  I require a host of intact ghoul hearts
[12617.05s -> 12619.29s]  from the surrounding area.
[12619.29s -> 12622.17s]  There's something special about the ravenous dead nearby.
[12623.01s -> 12626.37s]  They can reanimate with only a few drops of blood.
[12626.37s -> 12627.21s]  I don't know what happened.
[12627.21s -> 12629.09s]  I'd venture out and retrieve these myself,
[12629.09s -> 12633.37s]  but I'm more accustomed to dealing with the fully dead.
[12633.37s -> 12636.41s]  Your discretion is appreciated, of course,
[12636.41s -> 12643.42s]  and you will be rewarded.
[12643.42s -> 12653.54s]  Better?
[12653.54s -> 12656.22s]  Cool.
[12656.22s -> 12658.26s]  Yeah, let me just do this next little arc
[12658.26s -> 12676.39s]  and we'll go back to, we'll go back to Nasidro.
[12676.39s -> 12677.47s]  Stay in Diablo?
[12679.71s -> 12680.79s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[12680.79s -> 12683.18s]  I'm down for pretty much anything.
[12683.18s -> 12684.50s]  We'll see how this goes.
[12684.50s -> 12692.74s]  I am enjoying playing this, just saying.
[12692.74s -> 12696.32s]  Ghoul hearts.
[12696.32s -> 12697.44s]  Indecisive?
[12697.44s -> 12699.04s]  That's literally my entire life.
[12700.85s -> 12703.41s]  My whole life is being indecisive of things.
[12712.10s -> 12712.94s]  What's that?
[12718.82s -> 12728.99s]  Offhand?
[12728.99s -> 12741.50s]  I think the stab is better.
[12741.50s -> 12743.18s]  We got a great hairline.
[12743.18s -> 12744.94s]  Well, the thing about hairlines is
[12744.94s -> 12749.86s]  what they change every five to seven years, right?
[12749.86s -> 12752.42s]  I've been told.
[12752.42s -> 12757.21s]  You notice a difference every five to 10 years.
[12757.21s -> 12761.11s]  So if it stays like this for like five to 10 years,
[12761.11s -> 12762.63s]  I'm happy with that.
[12762.63s -> 12767.35s]  Although, at what point of the cycle am I in, right?
[12767.35s -> 12768.99s]  Am I at the end of the 10 years
[12768.99s -> 12772.22s]  or am I at the beginning of a new 10 years?
[12772.22s -> 12774.34s]  For a hairline, what your hairline looks like.
[12774.34s -> 12775.80s]  That's the question.
[12775.80s -> 12791.38s]  Would be the end.
[12791.38s -> 12795.74s]  I lack the needed magic.
[12795.74s -> 12798.74s]  That's a cool shrine.
[12798.74s -> 12801.02s]  Dude, your roots are holding on for dear life.
[12801.02s -> 12810.62s]  You're definitely at the end of the cycle.
[12810.62s -> 12821.98s]  More strangers in the camp.
[12821.98s -> 12825.59s]  Ooh, iron.
[12825.59s -> 12828.48s]  Your roots are hanging on.
[12828.52s -> 12831.16s]  Well, I think they're fine for a little another while,
[12831.16s -> 12833.86s]  at least, I don't know.
[12833.86s -> 12835.38s]  Are you Viggo?
[12835.38s -> 12836.22s]  I was sent here.
[12840.48s -> 12841.32s]  That.
[12851.71s -> 12852.55s]  This is a loud.
[12854.34s -> 12856.87s]  Mother's trapped in there with her.
[12856.87s -> 12858.87s]  You let my mother through, sir.
[12858.87s -> 12861.11s]  Shouldn't you be responsible for her safety?
[12863.30s -> 12865.18s]  We have soldiers stationed inside.
[12865.18s -> 12867.02s]  You should be worried about them too.
[12867.02s -> 12869.02s]  Did I fuck this up?
[12872.10s -> 12877.47s]  Maybe you can help.
[12877.47s -> 12879.49s]  I think it's gonna...
[12879.49s -> 12885.03s]  All right, we have to fix this.
[12885.03s -> 12887.03s]  The pots and pans are louder than the people.
[12887.03s -> 12887.87s]  I think it's because I have the...
[12887.87s -> 12890.59s]  This is all fucked up.
[12890.59s -> 12899.00s]  Hello.
[12899.00s -> 12901.28s]  Mines are closed on church orders.
[12901.28s -> 12903.00s]  They're not safe.
[12903.00s -> 12904.72s]  Especially not for children.
[12912.83s -> 12914.64s]  She did.
[12914.64s -> 12918.28s]  The horned woman is the demon Lilith.
[12920.79s -> 12924.59s]  No, that can't be.
[12924.59s -> 12927.51s]  My mother taught me that name.
[12927.51s -> 12929.95s]  You speak of the daughter of hatred.
[12931.38s -> 12933.58s]  Did Prava mention me?
[12933.58s -> 12936.38s]  She wasn't angry, was she?
[12936.38s -> 12938.58s]  There's more than your job at stake here.
[12941.76s -> 12943.78s]  Come on.
[12943.78s -> 12945.30s]  Let's get this over with.
[12951.84s -> 12954.38s]  Oh, what's my shirt say?
[12954.38s -> 12956.42s]  It's the Star Wars Periodic Table.
[12969.64s -> 12979.81s]  I like it.
[12979.81s -> 12981.88s]  I'm hoisted stuck.
[12981.88s -> 12985.77s]  We've got to go on foot.
[12985.77s -> 12986.61s]  Look out.
[12994.67s -> 12995.51s]  Level up.
[12996.39s -> 12998.55s]  Hey, that's my mother's charm on your wrist.
[12999.86s -> 13001.66s]  It's mine now, girl.
[13001.66s -> 13004.50s]  She gave it to me when I let her and her friend...
[13004.50s -> 13008.31s]  Ooh, wait a minute.
[13008.31s -> 13010.11s]  So engulf yourself in flames for two seconds,
[13010.11s -> 13015.24s]  burning surrounding enemies for 18 damage per second.
[13015.24s -> 13019.99s]  20 second cooldown.
[13019.99s -> 13026.37s]  That seems kind of good though.
[13026.37s -> 13030.07s]  18 damage a second.
[13030.07s -> 13042.52s]  I mean, that's like 40 damage over two seconds.
[13042.52s -> 13044.16s]  This heal, self-heal.
[13047.90s -> 13055.82s]  Teleport is always good.
[13055.82s -> 13063.40s]  I kind of like this frost nova.
[13063.40s -> 13064.32s]  I think I'm just gonna do this.
[13064.32s -> 13065.28s]  Just be damaged.
[13083.80s -> 13085.60s]  Two-spell Andy.
[13085.60s -> 13087.84s]  I know, but it does so much damage.
[13087.84s -> 13089.12s]  I'm destroying stuff.
[13094.45s -> 13096.13s]  Hey, look, if you wanna...
[13096.13s -> 13097.81s]  The person that has to go like...
[13098.97s -> 13099.81s]  Ice lance.
[13099.81s -> 13101.49s]  And then she...
[13101.49s -> 13103.25s]  Electric, electrical pulse.
[13104.05s -> 13104.89s]  Dash.
[13104.89s -> 13107.57s]  And then, machine gun.
[13107.57s -> 13108.41s]  I just go like this
[13108.41s -> 13120.79s]  and I do the same amount of damage that you did.
[13120.79s -> 13123.90s]  I just go like this.
[13123.90s -> 13130.83s]  Then motherfuckers explode.
[13130.83s -> 13134.94s]  But you have less fun.
[13134.98s -> 13137.50s]  Who said I was having less fun?
[13137.50s -> 13139.42s]  I kill people in one hit.
[13139.42s -> 13154.34s]  They die in one hit.
[13154.34s -> 13156.92s]  He's having no fun.
[13156.92s -> 13161.57s]  He's talking.
[13161.57s -> 13165.34s]  Whatever, we're playing.
[13165.34s -> 13167.22s]  Your face says you're not having fun.
[13167.22s -> 13168.82s]  Huh, what are you talking about?
[13178.01s -> 13178.85s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[13178.85s -> 13181.86s]  I only have two moves.
[13181.86s -> 13183.78s]  And one of them is here.
[13183.78s -> 13184.62s]  That doesn't really...
[13184.62s -> 13186.26s]  I should just take this off the bar, right?
[13186.26s -> 13189.25s]  Cause I'm not really doing it.
[13189.25s -> 13190.81s]  One move.
[13190.81s -> 13193.65s]  Maybe we should go back.
[13193.65s -> 13195.29s]  Round up the knights.
[13195.29s -> 13196.13s]  And leave my mother in...
[13196.13s -> 13198.21s]  Hey, nobody complains to Cyclops
[13198.21s -> 13199.85s]  when he takes his glasses off.
[13199.85s -> 13202.72s]  No, I'm going on.
[13202.72s -> 13203.56s]  Cyclops.
[13203.56s -> 13207.12s]  I mean, you should do something else.
[13207.12s -> 13207.96s]  Why?
[13209.12s -> 13210.96s]  Out of mana, once again.
[13216.47s -> 13222.21s]  What do you mean what?
[13222.21s -> 13223.05s]  What do you mean what?
[13223.05s -> 13224.57s]  Cyclops takes his glasses off
[13224.57s -> 13226.93s]  and he has red beams come out of his eyes.
[13226.93s -> 13227.77s]  That's all he has.
[13227.77s -> 13229.21s]  That's what he does.
[13229.25s -> 13232.64s]  He just goes...
[13232.64s -> 13233.48s]  And it's like, holy shit, dude.
[13233.48s -> 13235.16s]  He's annihilated the whole room.
[13235.16s -> 13236.00s]  Nice job.
[13250.09s -> 13251.81s]  Bro, you're onto nothing.
[13251.81s -> 13256.37s]  Cyclops has the glasses that kind of constricts his eyes
[13256.37s -> 13258.13s]  to make it so the blazer beams don't come out.
[13258.13s -> 13259.37s]  And he takes glasses off and he...
[13259.37s -> 13260.61s]  I've seen every...
[13260.61s -> 13262.89s]  Cyclops is like my favorite character in Marvel.
[13262.89s -> 13263.81s]  I'm low on practice.
[13263.81s -> 13265.33s]  Side Spider-Man.
[13265.33s -> 13266.29s]  And Wolverine.
[13267.84s -> 13280.48s]  And what is Cyclops' name?
[13280.48s -> 13281.32s]  Scott.
[13294.43s -> 13300.99s]  Real fan.
[13300.99s -> 13302.31s]  I didn't even have to even type that one
[13302.31s -> 13304.97s]  on the second monitor.
[13304.97s -> 13308.53s]  I'm low on precious mana.
[13308.53s -> 13310.13s]  Beams are too damn old.
[13310.13s -> 13310.97s]  What happened?
[13310.97s -> 13312.61s]  Shaking like leaves.
[13323.34s -> 13324.98s]  Cyclops was never given a chance to level up
[13324.98s -> 13328.40s]  and pick a new skill.
[13328.40s -> 13337.68s]  That's fair.
[13337.68s -> 13339.24s]  I'm low on precious mana.
[13340.44s -> 13341.28s]  What?
[13341.28s -> 13342.08s]  All right, but hold on a minute.
[13342.08s -> 13344.92s]  Why are you assuming that Cyclops,
[13344.92s -> 13350.42s]  Scott Cyclops would pick like Icebolt?
[13351.50s -> 13352.34s]  No, he would just be like,
[13352.34s -> 13353.18s]  wait a minute,
[13353.18s -> 13354.26s]  the thing that I already know how to do,
[13354.26s -> 13356.10s]  the thing I already know what's happening,
[13356.10s -> 13357.74s]  the thing I already have been used to,
[13357.74s -> 13361.38s]  I can just make it do 20% more damage.
[13361.38s -> 13362.58s]  Who's picking that one?
[13397.07s -> 13397.91s]  Itchy ear.
[13411.98s -> 13412.98s]  When is the...
[13412.98s -> 13415.02s]  Special about this place anyway.
[13415.02s -> 13416.46s]  What would draw Lilith here?
[13416.46s -> 13418.18s]  What's the level cap in the beta?
[13418.18s -> 13419.46s]  Hell if I know.
[13419.46s -> 13420.30s]  Is there one?
[13420.30s -> 13421.66s]  Trevor doesn't tell us anything.
[13421.66s -> 13424.22s]  No one goes in, nothing comes out.
[13424.22s -> 13425.06s]  That's all.
[13426.06s -> 13437.22s]  Ego is no longer following you.
[13437.22s -> 13438.38s]  They're not following me anymore.
[13438.38s -> 13439.86s]  No lift.
[13439.86s -> 13442.10s]  The jam must be deeper down.
[13442.10s -> 13442.94s]  Does he like it?
[13442.94s -> 13444.82s]  I do.
[13444.82s -> 13446.18s]  The thing about a game like this though,
[13446.18s -> 13449.58s]  is going through the story
[13449.58s -> 13452.34s]  and going through the game progression,
[13452.34s -> 13453.58s]  it's enjoyable, it's fun.
[13453.58s -> 13457.18s]  It's kind of just relaxing to play, right?
[13457.18s -> 13460.30s]  But the real test, if this game is any good,
[13460.30s -> 13466.30s]  is 12 hours from now, 20 hours from now.
[13466.30s -> 13467.38s]  I think that's how you really tell
[13467.94s -> 13470.14s]  of a game like this, is there any fun for real?
[13470.14s -> 13473.18s]  Because that's where the loot,
[13473.18s -> 13475.02s]  you go find the certain gear
[13475.02s -> 13477.26s]  and do the high level bosses and the dungeons
[13477.26s -> 13479.89s]  and is that fun.
[13479.89s -> 13483.29s]  It's hard to say, oh wow, Diablo 4, this is fantastic.
[13483.29s -> 13486.57s]  I kind of don't know until you have to play it.
[13486.57s -> 13488.93s]  I think there's enough time that you have to pass
[13488.93s -> 13492.17s]  for you to experience this,
[13492.17s -> 13494.17s]  at least the part of the game that I want to experience.
[13501.50s -> 13502.74s]  Nowhere to go.
[13502.74s -> 13505.26s]  My favorite part about Diablo 2
[13505.26s -> 13511.30s]  was just opening up the Mephisto loot box.
[13511.30s -> 13512.30s]  That was my favorite thing to do.
[13512.30s -> 13514.14s]  I loved the item hunting.
[13514.14s -> 13515.66s]  That was the best part for me.
[13536.21s -> 13537.53s]  My favorite part about Diablo 4
[13537.53s -> 13541.41s]  is Nancy Drew out of Mana once again.
[13541.41s -> 13543.09s]  That's a pretty good part as well.
[13547.02s -> 13551.28s]  My favorite part about Diablo was the loot boxes.
[13551.28s -> 13555.15s]  I mean, kind of.
[13555.15s -> 13559.11s]  Killing Mephisto or killing Diablo was,
[13559.11s -> 13559.95s]  boom, boom, boom, boom.
[13559.95s -> 13562.71s]  There's the, okay, two greens, a yellow,
[13562.71s -> 13564.95s]  and ah, there's no unique.
[13564.95s -> 13565.91s]  That's all right, but cool.
[13565.91s -> 13568.13s]  What's the set though?
[13568.13s -> 13572.60s]  It's just fun to do.
[13572.60s -> 13574.28s]  And then trading was kind of fun too,
[13574.28s -> 13575.52s]  being able to be like, oh, I got this
[13575.52s -> 13581.81s]  and this is kind of fun, I can trade this.
[13581.81s -> 13583.57s]  That's a huge part of why I feel like a lot of people
[13583.57s -> 13592.18s]  played the old Diablo games.
[13592.18s -> 13593.82s]  I liked collecting stuff too.
[13593.82s -> 13596.94s]  Every time I made a character in old Diablo,
[13596.98s -> 13598.82s]  I always had to have a,
[13598.82s -> 13601.02s]  I'd have like three or four other characters
[13601.02s -> 13604.95s]  just to hold perfect topazes.
[13604.95s -> 13605.79s]  I would never use them.
[13605.79s -> 13606.95s]  I just wanted to have them.
[13606.95s -> 13612.10s]  You'd have like 20 rows of ding, ding, ding, ding.
[13612.10s -> 13616.43s]  Just perfect skulls, perfect topazes, perfect emeralds.
[13616.43s -> 13617.27s]  It's fun to collect.
[13617.27s -> 13623.06s]  It was a collecting game for me.
[13623.06s -> 13627.06s]  That was quick thinking.
[13627.06s -> 13629.14s]  You freak hoarder.
[13629.14s -> 13630.78s]  You hoarder.
[13630.78s -> 13636.93s]  It's Diablo.
[13636.93s -> 13640.93s]  Why would your mother leave you like that?
[13640.93s -> 13644.70s]  She wouldn't, or she shouldn't have.
[13644.70s -> 13646.14s]  I really was like a little loot goblin
[13646.14s -> 13647.82s]  is having like the sack over my shoulder.
[13647.82s -> 13661.11s]  Like, oh, you're looking for perfect skulls?
[13661.11s -> 13662.35s]  I've got plenty of those.
[13670.49s -> 13672.49s]  Identifying an item was always cool too.
[13675.95s -> 13677.15s]  I don't know how many people don't know
[13677.15s -> 13679.87s]  how Diablo really works or I don't even know
[13679.87s -> 13680.71s]  how it works in this game
[13680.71s -> 13681.55s]  because I haven't really found one yet,
[13681.55s -> 13684.97s]  but getting an item that you know
[13684.97s -> 13687.37s]  was potentially really cool
[13687.37s -> 13691.05s]  and needing to have that second step of,
[13691.05s -> 13692.85s]  all right, what is it?
[13692.85s -> 13696.61s]  Or what are the roles on it?
[13696.61s -> 13698.09s]  What's the enhanced defense role?
[13698.09s -> 13699.69s]  What's the enhanced damage role?
[13699.69s -> 13702.09s]  Enhanced damage role, this is a big deal.
[13702.09s -> 13704.34s]  What is it?
[13704.34s -> 13706.09s]  It was fun.
[13706.09s -> 13711.48s]  Now, I don't love wild RNG.
[13711.48s -> 13714.00s]  One of my favorite parts about D2 was the unique items.
[13714.00s -> 13715.44s]  I know you can just spam that, that's fine.
[13715.44s -> 13716.52s]  Spam the emote.
[13716.52s -> 13720.81s]  That's, I don't fucking have chat anymore.
[13721.65s -> 13723.26s]  Shit.
[13723.26s -> 13726.80s]  All right, one of my favorite parts about Diablo 2
[13726.80s -> 13729.48s]  was that a unique item was the same.
[13729.48s -> 13730.32s]  Every time you found it,
[13730.32s -> 13733.76s]  let's say it was like a unique colossal sword, right?
[13733.76s -> 13736.12s]  It was always gonna be the grandfather colossal sword, right?
[13736.12s -> 13739.74s]  But when you opened it, when you identified it,
[13739.74s -> 13743.02s]  there was a couple of parameters that were random.
[13743.02s -> 13744.82s]  It was always the same parameter,
[13744.82s -> 13748.58s]  but it was either a good percentage, lower or higher.
[13748.58s -> 13752.06s]  It was always a percentage that was lower or higher.
[13752.90s -> 13757.30s]  And I, and I'm getting booed off the stage.
[13759.11s -> 13760.31s]  But you know what I mean.
[13767.20s -> 13772.20s]  But an item having 200 to 250% enhanced damage
[13772.84s -> 13778.11s]  and it rolls a 201 is like a,
[13778.11s -> 13780.87s]  I'm still gonna use this and, but no, it sucks,
[13780.87s -> 13782.83s]  but it's okay because it's still the same item.
[13782.83s -> 13785.35s]  Now it's of mana once again.
[13785.35s -> 13787.71s]  I wasn't a big fan of having everything
[13787.71s -> 13788.83s]  be random on the item.
[13789.67s -> 13792.87s]  Just be kind of just throw dice in the air.
[13792.87s -> 13796.24s]  But if you rolled like a 240, okay.
[13796.24s -> 13797.56s]  Now you're talking.
[13797.56s -> 13800.42s]  Now you're talking.
[13800.42s -> 13801.26s]  I'm just gonna get up and do this
[13801.26s -> 13816.65s]  in an open mic night one day.
[13816.65s -> 13821.24s]  This game is cringe.
[13821.24s -> 13822.08s]  Okay.
[13835.09s -> 13836.74s]  Yeah.
[13836.74s -> 13837.58s]  This cringe.
[13847.50s -> 13848.38s]  Well, I only have two moves,
[13848.38s -> 13849.98s]  so it doesn't look cool when I do that.
[13849.98s -> 13850.82s]  But you know what I mean?
[13850.82s -> 13863.88s]  It would have been cool if I had three or four moves.
[13863.88s -> 13864.72s]  All right, here we go.
[13864.72s -> 13875.21s]  An opening.
[13875.21s -> 13876.09s]  Get more spells.
[13877.81s -> 13879.57s]  Actually, all jokes aside,
[13879.57s -> 13903.71s]  this is working out pretty fine.
[13903.71s -> 13909.93s]  Flame shield.
[13909.93s -> 13912.17s]  Charge bolts is fun.
[13912.17s -> 13922.05s]  At least it was in the other games.
[13922.05s -> 13934.60s]  Upgrade fireball.
[13934.60s -> 13946.73s]  Mana wouldn't be bad.
[13946.73s -> 13951.74s]  Upgrade fireball to be more like a hot.
[13951.74s -> 13956.09s]  That is actually really good.
[13956.09s -> 13958.89s]  Bigger radius.
[13958.89s -> 13961.25s]  Yeah.
[13961.25s -> 13962.33s]  If I got five points in this already,
[13962.33s -> 13964.41s]  then I definitely should just keep going this way.
[13964.41s -> 13972.00s]  Increased based on the distance traveled.
[13977.34s -> 13980.06s]  Tunnels closed.
[13980.06s -> 13982.81s]  We're trapped without the hoist.
[13982.81s -> 13986.02s]  Look, there she is.
[13986.02s -> 13987.98s]  Remember, why do you look like a Calvin Klein model?
[13987.98s -> 13991.98s]  Like your lips are doing some Zoolander shit tonight.
[13991.98s -> 13993.50s]  I think it's because I'm biting my lip
[13993.50s -> 14008.29s]  and I'm going like, look, I'm biting my lip.
[14008.29s -> 14010.57s]  I just turned the facecum on and I'm just like.
[14010.57s -> 14012.38s]  It's her.
[14012.38s -> 14014.93s]  The way I saw her.
[14014.93s -> 14016.74s]  Lilith.
[14016.74s -> 14019.63s]  We need to find my mother.
[14019.63s -> 14021.11s]  Now he's extra conscious of it.
[14021.11s -> 14021.95s]  Ah, it's all right.
[14021.95s -> 14025.08s]  I don't care.
[14025.08s -> 14026.60s]  I feel like this is gonna be a boss
[14026.60s -> 14036.43s]  and I really want to see what it is.
[14036.43s -> 14040.08s]  With my enhanced fireball.
[14040.08s -> 14046.04s]  No filters, no makeup.
[14046.04s -> 14054.67s]  I don't even know how to put one of those on.
[14054.67s -> 14055.51s]  Over there.
[14055.51s -> 14056.35s]  The hoist.
[14061.17s -> 14062.01s]  Filter.
[14066.18s -> 14068.77s]  At last, I'll ride out.
[14068.77s -> 14073.40s]  Oh hell.
[14073.40s -> 14074.88s]  Slane.
[14074.88s -> 14076.56s]  What happened?
[14076.56s -> 14077.48s]  This is on normal.
[14077.48s -> 14080.16s]  This is on the whatever tier two, whatever it is.
[14080.16s -> 14082.76s]  Veteran.
[14082.76s -> 14085.12s]  We need reinforcements.
[14085.12s -> 14087.24s]  I would even want to turn it up with another one.
[14087.24s -> 14090.13s]  I wonder how many they're gonna have at launch.
[14090.13s -> 14092.17s]  What was that?
[14092.17s -> 14093.97s]  It's came from beyond the gate.
[14096.70s -> 14105.91s]  This is definitely a boss room.
[14105.91s -> 14109.59s]  All right, let's do it.
[14109.59s -> 14112.26s]  The escort.
[14112.26s -> 14113.26s]  They're all dead.
[14119.20s -> 14123.28s]  Over there.
[14123.28s -> 14124.12s]  Who did this?
[14124.12s -> 14124.96s]  A woman.
[14126.16s -> 14128.86s]  Vico.
[14128.86s -> 14130.98s]  It was one of the women you sent.
[14133.99s -> 14136.91s]  Are they actually difficulty settings or are they bullshit?
[14137.75s -> 14138.59s]  Hi.
[14139.63s -> 14140.47s]  That's a good question.
[14140.47s -> 14141.31s]  I don't know.
[14141.31s -> 14143.51s]  This just makes monsters have more health, right?
[14143.51s -> 14144.71s]  You get more experience.
[14147.19s -> 14148.31s]  I don't know exactly what it does.
[14155.46s -> 14157.02s]  20% more health.
[14160.98s -> 14163.26s]  We can take a look.
[14163.26s -> 14164.10s]  Second hand.
[14165.90s -> 14167.74s]  I'm pretty sure you can change it off with life.
[14170.80s -> 14171.64s]  You did nothing.
[14173.48s -> 14174.92s]  Spells.
[14174.92s -> 14175.96s]  Bears.
[14175.96s -> 14180.17s]  All you supposed to do is go to Korvala,
[14180.17s -> 14183.33s]  tell Prava, raise the army.
[14183.33s -> 14187.15s]  The father, evil, itself.
[14188.31s -> 14189.63s]  Mox sanctuary.
[14192.44s -> 14198.39s]  Do this for me.
[14198.39s -> 14200.47s]  He's dead.
[14200.47s -> 14202.56s]  Hand on tail.
[14202.56s -> 14207.62s]  Your mother told me this trinket would bring good fortune
[14207.62s -> 14210.18s]  to think I trusted her.
[14210.18s -> 14213.22s]  She bribed you with it, didn't she?
[14213.22s -> 14216.83s]  You weren't supposed to let her through at all.
[14216.83s -> 14218.15s]  But it's not too late.
[14218.15s -> 14220.76s]  She can still be saved.
[14220.76s -> 14222.36s]  Not by me.
[14222.36s -> 14223.84s]  Not anymore.
[14223.84s -> 14224.68s]  There it was.
[14224.68s -> 14227.68s]  Prava will know what to do.
[14227.68s -> 14229.56s]  You're leaving us?
[14229.56s -> 14231.28s]  Abandoning her?
[14231.28s -> 14232.12s]  What happened to my buddy, Eric?
[14232.12s -> 14234.24s]  There's nothing left to abandon.
[14234.24s -> 14235.52s]  Yeah.
[14235.56s -> 14237.56s]  She's good as dead.
[14237.56s -> 14238.72s]  I'm sorry, kid.
[14238.72s -> 14239.56s]  Yeah.
[14239.56s -> 14240.56s]  I heard about Eric.
[14240.56s -> 14245.07s]  He really just left us.
[14245.07s -> 14245.91s]  Damn.
[14245.91s -> 14249.22s]  It's up to us now.
[14249.22s -> 14250.18s]  He's bored?
[14250.18s -> 14251.94s]  I'm just playing a game, relax.
[14260.99s -> 14264.06s]  Lilith can't be too far.
[14264.06s -> 14272.39s]  We're actually gonna fight Lilith right now, are we?
[14272.39s -> 14279.39s]  What is this?
[14279.39s -> 14282.54s]  Now your mother races.
[14282.54s -> 14284.03s]  Yes.
[14284.03s -> 14289.30s]  I am Lilith, mother of sanctuary.
[14289.30s -> 14291.73s]  Daughter of hatred.
[14291.73s -> 14295.66s]  I have what you seek.
[14295.66s -> 14297.70s]  You hunger for knowledge.
[14297.70s -> 14298.54s]  Water.
[14298.54s -> 14301.62s]  You dragged your child all over sanctuary
[14301.62s -> 14304.10s]  in pursuit of it.
[14304.10s -> 14307.10s]  No, I taught her how to survive.
[14308.18s -> 14312.39s]  Is that what you want to believe?
[14312.39s -> 14315.10s]  Drop the act.
[14315.10s -> 14317.38s]  You have questions.
[14317.38s -> 14319.86s]  I have answers.
[14320.74s -> 14326.30s]  I know the fabric of the cosmos.
[14326.38s -> 14330.39s]  Everything I've read has warned me against you.
[14330.39s -> 14336.91s]  You've read so much, yet know so little.
[14336.91s -> 14339.59s]  Will you accept my offer?
[14339.59s -> 14340.99s]  No.
[14340.99s -> 14345.11s]  I don't know.
[14345.11s -> 14346.43s]  Will you let me try?
[14348.43s -> 14350.11s]  Take the fucking glasses off.
[14350.11s -> 14353.45s]  Your mother is alive.
[14353.45s -> 14356.21s]  She came this way with Lilith.
[14356.21s -> 14360.54s]  How can you be sure?
[14360.54s -> 14364.51s]  Sometimes I see visions of the past.
[14364.51s -> 14366.67s]  I saw them.
[14366.67s -> 14367.83s]  What?
[14367.83s -> 14369.55s]  How?
[14369.55s -> 14371.48s]  Lilith's petals.
[14371.48s -> 14374.53s]  Her blood was fed to me once.
[14374.53s -> 14377.18s]  You stupid human.
[14377.18s -> 14382.35s]  I'm immune to the plasma damage that your eyes emit.
[14382.35s -> 14387.59s]  It's too bad because ice and fire both hurt a lot.
[14388.63s -> 14392.27s]  It has 10 points in it.
[14392.27s -> 14415.93s]  That was too much.
[14415.93s -> 14418.77s]  Oh well.
[14418.77s -> 14423.08s]  Chat is more divided.
[14423.08s -> 14426.97s]  You watched X-Man yesterday, didn't you?
[14426.97s -> 14430.03s]  No.
[14444.18s -> 14450.39s]  Are we really going to argue that Cyclops didn't have the best drip out of all the X-Men?
[14450.39s -> 14461.53s]  It would be weird if you were to say that.
[14461.53s -> 14466.25s]  Just drip.
[14466.25s -> 14466.97s]  What are you talking about?
[14466.97s -> 14472.57s]  I said drip, drip, drip.
[14472.89s -> 14474.29s]  You guys.
[14474.29s -> 14489.10s]  Fucked.
[14489.10s -> 14490.22s]  I didn't say drip.
[14490.22s -> 14494.76s]  I said drip.
[14494.76s -> 14495.52s]  Watch the clip.
[14495.52s -> 14498.48s]  Boy, just go download a clip and watch it.
[14498.48s -> 14499.24s]  I didn't say that.
[14499.24s -> 14506.54s]  I said drip.
[14506.54s -> 14507.66s]  They're going to get out of here.
[14507.66s -> 14515.02s]  They're going to get out of here for a minute.
[14515.02s -> 14518.11s]  Yeah.
[14518.11s -> 14519.59s]  You definitely said no.
[14519.59s -> 14520.39s]  Give me a clip.
[14520.39s -> 14524.02s]  I want to see it right now.
[14524.02s -> 14524.94s]  Somebody show it to me.
[14524.94s -> 14525.42s]  Link it to me.
[14525.42s -> 14525.82s]  I want to see.
[14525.82s -> 14529.41s]  I prove it to me.
[14529.41s -> 14551.67s]  Fucking die.
[14551.67s -> 14558.53s]  Out of mana once again.
[14558.53s -> 14575.30s]  Are we really going to argue that Cyclops didn't have the best drip out of all the X-Men?
[14575.30s -> 14576.86s]  I didn't do that!
[14576.86s -> 14577.86s]  What?
[14577.86s -> 14589.33s]  Are we really going to argue that Cyclops didn't have the best drip out of all-
[14589.33s -> 14590.33s]  It's drip!
[14590.33s -> 14591.53s]  I said drip.
[14591.53s -> 14592.85s]  I swear to you.
[14592.85s -> 14613.74s]  Are we really going to argue that Cyclops didn't have the best drip out of all the X-Men?
[14613.74s -> 14617.18s]  No, dude, it's D. I'm telling you. I said D
[14621.15s -> 14625.84s]  I don't know. We're really gonna argue that
[14626.96s -> 14628.96s]  like
[14643.76s -> 14648.08s]  It's the noise gate on here or something I why would I say that i'm talking about his clothes
[14648.40s -> 14651.44s]  He's got these he's got the blue and he's got the yellow
[14653.36s -> 14655.36s]  And it's it's I
[14655.68s -> 14657.68s]  I whatever who cares?
[14657.76s -> 14661.60s]  Fuck it. You know, fuck it. Whatever. Yeah, cool. I don't care. Yeah
[14663.02s -> 14665.66s]  Yeah, we're good. We're cool. But either way, I don't care
[14666.46s -> 14672.26s]  Yeah, we're good
[14672.26s -> 14674.26s]  Fuck it. We're still alive. It's fine
[14687.25s -> 14689.25s]  I can't fucking believe it's funny
[14694.08s -> 14696.08s]  It literally is the noise gate
[14696.16s -> 14699.36s]  Well, let them let them have their let them have their fun. It's okay
[14713.28s -> 14715.28s]  Okay, I need to find a deeper way
[14717.66s -> 14718.84s]  into
[14718.84s -> 14727.07s]  kasama
[14727.07s -> 14736.77s]  this works
[14736.85s -> 14742.72s]  rathma
[14742.72s -> 14743.68s]  Yeah
[14743.68s -> 14747.58s]  there
[14747.58s -> 14755.38s]  All right, let's go. You think you're better than us. Just remember when I said that
[14767.55s -> 14769.23s]  grip gate
[14769.23s -> 14771.23s]  So curious
[14771.63s -> 14774.83s]  You are eager to know why you were spared
[14776.19s -> 14778.40s]  Yes
[14778.40s -> 14782.40s]  Do you have faith in me freaking water through straw is hard to do
[14782.96s -> 14785.54s]  want to
[14785.54s -> 14789.57s]  Good for now. All you need know
[14790.54s -> 14792.54s]  Is that we are going to meet?
[14792.78s -> 14795.09s]  my son
[14795.09s -> 14797.84s]  rathma the first necromancer
[14799.63s -> 14801.63s]  Here's that I just want to like
[14802.91s -> 14805.15s]  You know what I mean? Here's the key to my plant
[14806.86s -> 14809.74s]  It sounds like they're searching for lilith's son rathma
[14811.54s -> 14813.97s]  together
[14813.97s -> 14815.97s]  What are you thinking?
[14820.48s -> 14822.48s]  Just drink it
[14847.66s -> 14855.63s]  Okay, so when you drink water, oh my god drinking water through a straw it's like
[14856.83s -> 14858.83s]  This I want to just
[14859.47s -> 14862.37s]  I want to just you know what grottobeast.net
[14862.83s -> 14867.71s]  Uh, if I were you out check it out. It's a fun game that we got a fun piece of community merchandise
[14868.27s -> 14870.40s]  I would love for you to check it out
[14870.40s -> 14872.80s]  And uh, I got a glow in the dark shirt
[14872.88s -> 14877.20s]  We'll take a picture of it so you can see what the glow in the dark really looks like about a shitty webcam
[14877.84s -> 14879.84s]  Should be cool. It looks pretty cool
[14882.51s -> 14891.46s]  Grip game
[14903.39s -> 14909.50s]  What I was trying to say is I like to drink water faster than I can get it out through straw
[14928.86s -> 14967.20s]  Especially when i'm just thirsty as hell just use a bigger straw I need mana
[14978.37s -> 14984.13s]  I was gonna say that was this
[14990.18s -> 15023.18s]  Do the vortex trick so the water goes into the straw faster. How does that work? Oh, I completely forgot
[15024.14s -> 15025.18s]  um
[15025.18s -> 15027.55s]  So the grottobeast resale stuff
[15027.79s -> 15030.42s]  There's been some questions on that i'll answer very quickly
[15031.22s -> 15033.78s]  so the whole point of the presale was to make sure that
[15035.17s -> 15037.65s]  We didn't run out of inventory
[15038.37s -> 15040.37s]  We'd be able to get more for this period
[15041.90s -> 15044.94s]  But as of this coming, I believe this coming week
[15045.42s -> 15047.42s]  We're going to be coming out of the presale
[15049.42s -> 15052.06s]  So what that really realistically means
[15053.18s -> 15054.70s]  is that
[15054.70s -> 15056.22s]  We're not
[15056.22s -> 15060.82s]  gonna die
[15060.82s -> 15079.25s]  Okay, so with that really with that. Ooh, hold on 10 almost 10 crowd controlled enemies
[15080.61s -> 15082.05s]  Close enemies
[15082.05s -> 15100.45s]  Okay, so just it's essentially 14. It's 13 to 14 percent more damage. No matter what very cool. Got a lucky hit
[15101.46s -> 15102.82s]  Close enemies
[15102.82s -> 15104.58s]  And then more lightning damage
[15104.58s -> 15109.36s]  So I gotta get close
[15110.64s -> 15111.84s]  But yeah, so
[15111.84s -> 15113.84s]  We're confident now
[15113.84s -> 15117.36s]  That a lot of the we want to make sure that the people that really wanted to get in on it
[15118.16s -> 15122.16s]  Had access to it. So now we're just coming out of presale soon
[15122.88s -> 15124.32s]  so just
[15124.32s -> 15127.60s]  When they're gone if they are gone, then that's it
[15128.46s -> 15129.82s]  um
[15129.82s -> 15131.66s]  There's still availability
[15131.66s -> 15135.50s]  So I wouldn't worry too much about oh shit. I gotta hurry the fuck up
[15136.30s -> 15142.62s]  Uh, but we're we don't need to be in a presale anymore as of um, this this first shipment especially
[15143.26s -> 15145.26s]  So this first shipment is going
[15145.50s -> 15147.50s]  Pretty soon from my understanding. So
[15148.54s -> 15158.11s]  Yeah
[15161.33s -> 15172.94s]  Did you die your eyes, um, no
[15175.07s -> 15180.75s]  You've mastered your fear. I was at selling but first your expectations sense. We'll talk about this
[15182.90s -> 15185.55s]  You miss your daughter
[15185.55s -> 15187.71s]  My magpie
[15187.71s -> 15189.71s]  She's scared right now
[15189.79s -> 15191.92s]  She must be
[15191.92s -> 15195.31s]  Go or stay
[15196.22s -> 15198.22s]  It is time to choose
[15198.30s -> 15203.66s]  I I trained her. Well, she's a good kid strong
[15204.30s -> 15207.06s]  She'll be all right. She
[15207.06s -> 15209.30s]  You've chosen well
[15209.30s -> 15211.38s]  my child
[15211.38s -> 15213.38s]  To reach rathma
[15213.46s -> 15216.98s]  We will need to cross a lake at the bottom of these ruins
[15218.54s -> 15220.54s]  It requires a ritual
[15221.49s -> 15223.49s]  I will teach you
[15224.05s -> 15230.58s]  As you wish mother you're ready for lesson one
[15231.94s -> 15234.30s]  Blood is the key
[15235.28s -> 15237.52s]  What did you see this time?
[15237.52s -> 15239.52s]  I don't need sparing tell me
[15240.67s -> 15247.73s]  Lilith plans to teach your mother a ritual one that needs blood your mother seemed
[15248.88s -> 15251.02s]  receptive
[15251.02s -> 15254.86s]  We have to reach them
[15257.12s -> 15258.64s]  Okay, so
[15258.64s -> 15262.48s]  It's been selling that the sales have absolutely been
[15263.36s -> 15266.40s]  Above and beyond expectations. It's part of the reason to do the presale
[15266.96s -> 15272.24s]  So I told you a couple weeks ago the booster packs. We had to do another print on the boosters
[15273.49s -> 15274.77s]  because
[15274.77s -> 15277.57s]  We essentially went through the whole first print
[15278.85s -> 15280.61s]  of the booster packs
[15280.61s -> 15284.93s]  So that was part of the reason to stay in a presale for a while because we didn't want to just have it run out
[15285.49s -> 15288.61s]  And then it's just okay. Well, that's it whoever gets it gets it
[15289.25s -> 15291.33s]  without making sure that people that want to get in
[15292.05s -> 15293.73s]  on this first pass
[15293.73s -> 15296.03s]  Are able to get in so
[15296.27s -> 15301.87s]  The second print of the boosters we're in the middle of going through that now so there's inventory now
[15302.43s -> 15308.67s]  And I think we're comfortable and confident to now just pull us out of a presale and just let it just exist now
[15310.21s -> 15312.53s]  Again, we were trying to make sure to make it so
[15313.25s -> 15315.68s]  We were just gonna get it if you wanted it
[15316.69s -> 15321.49s]  And now it should be able to be available. I mean, I I don't think there's any
[15323.73s -> 15325.73s]  If you were thinking right now that
[15326.05s -> 15331.33s]  Oh my god, it's gonna run out tomorrow when they come out of presale. That's that's not going to happen. I can
[15331.97s -> 15333.97s]  Um, well, I don't know but
[15334.69s -> 15336.69s]  We we do have plenty of inventory
[15337.41s -> 15339.41s]  now that being said
[15339.65s -> 15343.97s]  I i'm not going to promise you that there will be because who knows in the future i'm not going to say
[15345.25s -> 15346.69s]  But when it's gone
[15346.69s -> 15348.45s]  It will be gone
[15348.45s -> 15350.95s]  Uh, at least uh, once when we come out of presale
[15366.40s -> 15369.26s]  And I can briefly talk about the digital version
[15369.98s -> 15372.38s]  I talked about it very briefly. I'm just gonna reiterate it one more time
[15372.78s -> 15375.10s]  The idea is to have a digital version of this
[15376.22s -> 15379.50s]  Whether it be a mod of something else or some other standalone. We don't know
[15380.22s -> 15383.82s]  We're trying to figure that out. But the whole idea is to make it because this is channel merch
[15383.90s -> 15385.90s]  it's merch for this community, but
[15386.14s -> 15388.14s]  we do understand that
[15388.62s -> 15390.62s]  There is a game on top of it
[15391.02s -> 15394.30s]  And a lot of you guys a lot of people that would be buying this
[15394.94s -> 15397.82s]  Maybe you don't have access to be able to play a physical card game with somebody
[15397.82s -> 15399.82s]  So we want to make it so it was possible
[15400.06s -> 15404.14s]  We're able to play the actual game portion of it. You don't have to worry about it too much
[15405.42s -> 15408.86s]  So the merch can be merch for the channel and then we can have a game
[15409.74s -> 15411.74s]  a digital version of the game
[15412.30s -> 15422.22s]  That you don't really have to worry about and again, this would not be let me i'm gonna make this really clear
[15422.94s -> 15427.82s]  Whatever digital version that we do and like what I said, whether it's a mod or something else
[15428.78s -> 15430.78s]  This is not a case of
[15431.42s -> 15435.74s]  Oh now I have to buy digital card packs. No
[15436.70s -> 15437.98s]  No
[15437.98s -> 15439.90s]  That's not what would be happening
[15439.90s -> 15465.42s]  Would it be all card access in the digital version?
[15466.94s -> 15468.94s]  Think the idea is that that would be yes
[15469.78s -> 15474.26s]  We're still trying to figure that out. We don't know how to implement everything perfectly
[15474.98s -> 15480.16s]  But I think that's the idea
[15480.16s -> 15484.24s]  But we're not doing booster pack openings digitally. That's just not happening
[15485.52s -> 15490.53s]  Uh, because I don't it's not something I really want to do and everybody on the team agrees with that
[15491.17s -> 15501.92s]  That'd be kind of scummy
[15501.92s -> 15503.92s]  well, I mean, yeah, that's
[15503.92s -> 15507.60s]  like I want people to to enjoy the experience right whether you
[15509.81s -> 15511.89s]  The card box the card
[15513.33s -> 15515.17s]  The booster packs
[15515.17s -> 15519.57s]  It's it's merch. It's an interesting way for me to do instead of doing a hoodie
[15520.29s -> 15524.45s]  It's okay. Well, let's do this instead and this is like when we open up. What would you get? What's in the card packs?
[15524.45s -> 15526.21s]  What's in your booster or whatever?
[15526.21s -> 15528.21s]  Um, it was just an interesting idea
[15528.53s -> 15533.81s]  But we're not going to pretend that there's not a game on top of this that people might actually want to play and might actually care
[15533.81s -> 15539.98s]  About and how do you let everybody participate and have everybody enjoy something like that?
[15541.18s -> 15543.18s]  Especially when we think of how many people
[15544.51s -> 15546.51s]  You know from different countries, you know
[15547.71s -> 15554.67s]  You can't just play like a physical card game with somebody from like a different state or a different country or a different town, right?
[15555.63s -> 15562.14s]  And I don't want to have this turn into some never-ending monetized thing
[15563.02s -> 15568.30s]  That is oh, yeah, you bought the physical cards buy all the digital packs too. Good luck
[15569.58s -> 15571.58s]  No, I don't think so
[15573.76s -> 15575.76s]  We all seem to agree on that
[15589.01s -> 15591.17s]  We are very excited. So when people actually
[15592.05s -> 15596.53s]  Get them. I wonder what the the experience will be, right?
[15600.96s -> 15604.03s]  Yeah
[15604.11s -> 15607.31s]  Starter kit and the boosters are already 80 dollars and 10 dollars respectively
[15609.15s -> 15611.39s]  I'm not going to tell you
[15612.78s -> 15616.06s]  I'm not gonna make you buy a bunch of shit in a digital version. It's not gonna happen
[15616.70s -> 15631.92s]  Play with people online
[15631.92s -> 15633.92s]  Yeah, that that's kind of the idea
[15634.88s -> 15640.51s]  And there's plenty of opportunities to make something where that's possible
[15641.07s -> 15648.32s]  The reason to do it pretty much
[15648.32s -> 15650.16s]  this barrier
[15650.16s -> 15652.48s]  It looks like the same kind of magic as before
[15656.13s -> 15658.13s]  You're gonna run grotto beast tournaments
[15659.55s -> 15661.39s]  I that's
[15661.39s -> 15666.80s]  I think I can dispel it. I don't it's hard to say any answers to these questions because
[15667.92s -> 15673.36s]  Don't know
[15673.36s -> 15675.76s]  Let's make sure that it goes. Well
[15676.64s -> 15678.72s]  let's make sure that people get things and
[15679.76s -> 15685.84s]  Uh, let's get through part one first and then we'll figure out if there's a part two part three part four part five
[15688.94s -> 15721.71s]  Yeah, I did it no don't yes
[15725.60s -> 15727.60s]  I who was I even talking to?
[15728.00s -> 15730.80s]  Are they going to be reprints?
[15731.12s -> 15733.12s]  We've already done
[15733.36s -> 15735.36s]  Well, I don't know. What do you mean by reprint?
[15735.84s -> 15737.84s]  because we went through
[15738.88s -> 15744.24s]  We went through the booster pack inventory and needed to do a second print. Is that what you mean by that?
[15745.20s -> 15746.56s]  That's what you mean, right?
[15746.56s -> 15750.16s]  Because we already had to do that in the during the presale
[15754.45s -> 15758.53s]  And we think and we hope we have enough inventory now just to kind of have it
[15759.41s -> 15762.69s]  For as long as it's uh possible as long as it's available still
[15763.33s -> 15765.42s]  After we get out of presale
[15765.42s -> 15768.69s]  This is on the veteran difficulty
[15768.93s -> 15772.37s]  I mean re-release. Oh, I don't know. You're just in time
[15773.17s -> 15779.65s]  Beyond this lake lies. We don't have any of the first ball. I I I don't think I know
[15782.53s -> 15784.53s]  Reprint
[15785.25s -> 15788.13s]  But I could not pass through with her
[15788.77s -> 15790.88s]  I I
[15790.88s -> 15795.84s]  Black divine element, you see stop but I can find it. I'm so close
[15796.48s -> 15798.48s]  I simply need mother stop
[15799.20s -> 15801.20s]  Look at what Lilith has done to you
[15802.16s -> 15804.16s]  You're writing in your own blood
[15804.24s -> 15806.24s]  my little magpie
[15806.48s -> 15808.48s]  She awakened me
[15809.12s -> 15811.12s]  She showed me things
[15811.84s -> 15815.30s]  Can't even put into words
[15817.07s -> 15818.83s]  Once I finished
[15818.83s -> 15821.87s]  You will understand. I don't care what she showed you
[15822.51s -> 15824.51s]  Please let's just get out of here
[15828.27s -> 15832.53s]  Oh, I see yes clever magpie
[15833.87s -> 15837.33s]  Trying to lead me away so you can take all this for yourself
[15840.03s -> 15848.37s]  I discovered yours. I will finish these rooms
[15851.79s -> 15854.16s]  You must stop this
[15854.24s -> 15856.24s]  Look at the gifts she's given me
[15875.33s -> 15877.33s]  You won't take what's mine
[15882.13s -> 15915.27s]  Uh-oh rip them up now. Oh shit. I'm also potions
[15939.70s -> 15941.70s]  Oh pit lord
[15942.50s -> 15947.02s]  I'm not ready yet. This is so out of place
[15947.42s -> 15950.62s]  I'm not ready yet
[15953.66s -> 15959.62s]  I need time
[15959.62s -> 15965.76s]  Get out of my ears
[15965.84s -> 15968.46s]  Stop, why can I cast?
[15969.02s -> 15984.53s]  I need time to prepare that. Oh, i'm not ready yet
[15997.89s -> 16011.26s]  How are you still alive
[16016.00s -> 16017.70s]  You were
[16017.70s -> 16019.94s]  Any drops who are protecting me?
[16020.82s -> 16023.89s]  I don't want to hate you
[16026.02s -> 16027.86s]  i'm trying
[16027.86s -> 16032.66s]  I really am
[16033.38s -> 16037.14s]  We're going to make lilith pay for what she's done
[16038.66s -> 16040.66s]  So we need blessed blood
[16041.65s -> 16043.65s]  Go back to your prover
[16043.65s -> 16045.33s]  Get that blessing
[16045.33s -> 16047.33s]  beg if you need to
[16047.49s -> 16049.97s]  Whatever it takes
[16049.97s -> 16052.37s]  My mother started this damn ritual
[16053.41s -> 16055.41s]  I'm going to finish it
[16056.11s -> 16058.11s]  Meet me in the mistral woods
[16059.02s -> 16060.85s]  Why there?
[16060.85s -> 16063.17s]  The horodrim hid a vault there
[16064.46s -> 16066.54s]  Finding it was her life's work
[16068.27s -> 16070.74s]  So much for that
[16070.74s -> 16074.06s]  Maybe it will help with the ritual if not
[16074.62s -> 16077.87s]  At least I can bury her where she'd want
[16078.90s -> 16080.74s]  I need time
[16080.74s -> 16082.74s]  I'm sorry. Just leave me
[16083.38s -> 16088.66s]  And it really feels like the ritual didn't even work. I mean, there's nothing that like happened that was
[16090.51s -> 16094.10s]  Oh, no
[16094.10s -> 16098.77s]  Ah
[16098.77s -> 16099.97s]  Where's the loot?
[16099.97s -> 16110.38s]  Where's there's no there's no box or chest or anything
[16111.02s -> 16132.05s]  There's no box
[16132.05s -> 16134.93s]  Well, look at your inventory
[16137.38s -> 16139.22s]  Oh, I did get this
[16139.22s -> 16145.66s]  Let's do to all stats
[16145.66s -> 16147.66s]  I'll hold on to it. That seems pretty good
[16154.90s -> 16157.06s]  I need to look in town at all this stuff
[16186.50s -> 16188.26s]  All right, so if somebody here we go
[16188.26s -> 16192.90s]  So grotto beast rerelease as in will you be able to buy the game in the future after presale and stuff runs out?
[16193.70s -> 16196.26s]  Will it be a continuous item that you be able to purchase from the store?
[16197.30s -> 16199.54s]  So the way that it works with the printing
[16200.18s -> 16201.38s]  is
[16201.38s -> 16204.90s]  We have to be able to order a certain quantity for it to make sense from my understanding
[16206.18s -> 16208.08s]  and
[16208.08s -> 16213.52s]  I don't there's no plan on us doing like a year or two from now. Like oh, yeah, by the way turn it back on
[16214.50s -> 16217.70s]  um, I think the idea is that we have a lot of inventory now
[16218.50s -> 16219.78s]  and when it's
[16219.78s -> 16221.78s]  Done, it's done and it's a limited run
[16222.10s -> 16224.10s]  and then the digital version
[16224.42s -> 16226.42s]  Will be a thing that
[16226.72s -> 16228.72s]  Exists pretty much indefinitely
[16229.36s -> 16232.80s]  But I don't know it really I guess depends on demand too really depends
[16233.52s -> 16239.44s]  We we went into this as this uh being a limited run project that was supposed to be merged for the channel
[16240.24s -> 16241.20s]  um
[16241.20s -> 16245.68s]  And then the actual game portion of it can probably live pretty indefinitely through the digital version. So
[16246.97s -> 16248.81s]  Yeah, that's the idea
[16248.81s -> 16251.69s]  But we don't know we don't know how it's going to work out. We're
[16253.72s -> 16257.16s]  We're operating on it being a limited run piece of merch
[16258.03s -> 16262.35s]  That is going to exist until it doesn't and we have we have plenty of inventory
[16262.75s -> 16286.20s]  Let's see how it goes. I need to upgrade. I need a third spell
[16286.76s -> 16288.76s]  And I think it's going to be
[16288.76s -> 16290.76s]  All right. I need to slow people down
[16290.92s -> 16298.52s]  What about should it be flame shield?
[16298.52s -> 16300.81s]  That seems kind of good
[16300.81s -> 16308.25s]  I'm doing it
[16308.25s -> 16313.13s]  So you're immune when it's active. So if there's a bunch of enemies I can just press it and just go boom boom boom
[16313.93s -> 16321.47s]  Now these are the players I think
[16321.47s -> 16323.47s]  Oh it is these are other players
[16330.17s -> 16332.17s]  I need to go to the
[16332.17s -> 16341.71s]  Blacksmith what else is in here?
[16346.39s -> 16351.71s]  3,500 I wonder if it's always salvage
[16354.68s -> 16356.68s]  Let's have a look at you. Hmm
[16359.02s -> 16361.02s]  Buckets need reinforcing
[16361.50s -> 16363.93s]  This leather's cracked
[16363.93s -> 16366.25s]  What have you been getting yourself into? Huh?
[16367.72s -> 16371.16s]  Look you live or die by the quality of your equipment
[16371.88s -> 16373.88s]  If you have the coin and materials
[16374.28s -> 16376.28s]  I can improve it for you
[16376.36s -> 16381.23s]  Okay, so need something for
[16383.39s -> 16386.27s]  All right. Don't do this yet. Let me see
[16386.27s -> 16387.63s]  All right, give her to that
[16387.63s -> 16391.53s]  Get rid of that. That's good salvage
[16399.58s -> 16403.71s]  Hmm. Yeah, I just don't want to accidentally give her something I can use
[16407.71s -> 16409.87s]  You can take what's left like that. Okay
[16410.43s -> 16420.20s]  Let me get out of this menu
[16420.20s -> 16426.20s]  But this is more if I have 1.5 percent of 60 damage is like point like two or something. Who cares?
[16438.27s -> 16442.11s]  All right
[16442.99s -> 16451.69s]  Can't salvage that one, huh?
[16451.69s -> 16459.05s]  upgrade
[16459.05s -> 16461.05s]  What? Okay. Hold on a second
[16461.37s -> 16473.47s]  This is probably a bad idea
[16473.47s -> 16477.15s]  What about nancy drew? I oh my god nancy drew is just sitting in the cold
[16477.95s -> 16484.08s]  I don't think i'm gonna do this. You replace so much stuff in the early levels at what's the point
[16486.06s -> 16492.73s]  Is there a stash?
[16492.73s -> 16516.67s]  Where is it? There it is. I wonder how the stash works. Is it account found? Is it account stuff or is
[16517.23s -> 16524.11s]  Is it between characters? Is it just individual? Is there a a shared tab? How does it work?
[16524.75s -> 16527.08s]  What about sorcery?
[16527.08s -> 16528.60s]  Yeah, I know
[16528.60s -> 16532.12s]  I got to finish breath of the wild before sorcery though. I feel like that's more
[16533.40s -> 16535.40s]  Necessary because the new one's coming out soon
[16547.88s -> 16549.56s]  So you can buy
[16549.56s -> 16551.56s]  more tabs i'm assuming
[16551.72s -> 16560.78s]  Do I give these two?
[16560.78s -> 16570.03s]  Ravenous dead
[16570.03s -> 16572.11s]  Oh, it's part of the quest. I have to upgrade one thing
[16575.44s -> 16578.17s]  All right. I'll go i'll do it healing potion upgrade
[16583.14s -> 16598.75s]  Interesting. I'll do this first. Wait, hold on. You're not gonna play tears of the kingdom for years
[16611.21s -> 16613.21s]  excellent work friend
[16613.45s -> 16616.81s]  Ghoul hearts seem to have captivated the clergy as of late
[16617.61s -> 16619.61s]  It's no surprise really
[16620.07s -> 16623.53s]  Understanding your enemy is the first step to defeating them
[16624.17s -> 16626.17s]  What would you do if your soul was trapped in a cube?
[16626.97s -> 16630.65s]  Uh, I would wait patiently until some random dumb adventurer let me out
[16631.69s -> 16637.10s]  It might take a few thousand years might take a few million, but it would probably happen eventually
[16637.82s -> 16649.70s]  I could be patient
[16649.70s -> 16656.74s]  My husband feodor left our home in the middle of the night. I heard him talking to someone another woman
[16658.63s -> 16663.59s]  I went to confront them, but they fled towards a strange light in the forest
[16664.15s -> 16666.15s]  They have been gone all night
[16666.55s -> 16670.47s]  I think it's time. I went after him, but the forest is dangerous
[16671.03s -> 16673.03s]  Would you accompany me?
[16673.11s -> 16675.11s]  Hmm escort quest
[16678.01s -> 16679.37s]  Sure, let's go
[16679.37s -> 16686.44s]  Let me try my new move
[16686.44s -> 16695.40s]  That's fine. How does the new move work the radius?
[16707.13s -> 16708.82s]  Jesus
[16708.82s -> 16713.24s]  Uh, that's the case down here. I'll help the lady. Why not?
[16725.18s -> 16727.34s]  I wonder is magic find in the game
[16728.06s -> 16734.97s]  Because that was always fun in um
[16735.77s -> 16738.26s]  Diablo 2
[16753.14s -> 16755.26s]  All right, that was pretty good
[16755.26s -> 16757.82s]  That's pretty good. You group them all up and then just do the big fireball
[16759.02s -> 16771.46s]  Remember, would you go back to cuphead for money?
[16772.73s -> 16786.65s]  No, just out of curiosity though. How much money i'm just curious
[16787.29s -> 16811.62s]  What do you mean by that?
[16811.62s -> 16813.62s]  No, I got everything I wanted at a cuphead
[16815.43s -> 16818.23s]  It was a very very fun experience. The game was great
[16819.13s -> 16827.64s]  But i'm done with it games like that. I probably go back to every so often usually like a year or two will
[16828.84s -> 16831.74s]  Cuphead's one of those gamer cooldowns
[16834.55s -> 16836.55s]  You know what I mean? You got like a gamer cooldown
[16837.19s -> 16841.51s]  Where you play it and a year goes by and it's like, all right, i'm ready to do it again
[16841.91s -> 16847.30s]  that happens to me with dark souls it happens to me with
[16847.86s -> 16850.95s]  pretty much any
[16850.95s -> 16852.47s]  Game that requires
[16852.47s -> 16860.50s]  very intense focus
[16860.50s -> 16869.72s]  You get the gamer cooldown
[16873.24s -> 16877.08s]  I said, oh come off it. What do you mean? What's that? That was very
[16877.88s -> 16880.25s]  Oh, come on
[16880.78s -> 16883.21s]  Come off it
[16883.21s -> 16884.84s]  Is he drunk?
[16884.84s -> 16887.06s]  No, what?
[16887.06s -> 16890.90s]  Why was that such a weird that was a weird take to some people what was it?
[16897.05s -> 16901.08s]  It's kind of like a movie or some really really
[16901.96s -> 16932.57s]  There's a lot of movies that I you know, movie cooldown same thing. Do I have to stand still for that?
[16933.21s -> 16946.87s]  Wait, will neff wants to play bill wants to play
[16948.20s -> 16951.88s]  Oh, hold on. I think wait is that what I I got a notification over here. Hold on a second
[16955.38s -> 16958.52s]  Oh, no, the dru the dru crew is about to be very disappointed
[16960.76s -> 16967.16s]  Oh
[16967.24s -> 16969.72s]  But that's not hold on that's not accurate
[16970.83s -> 16973.71s]  It's very possible that I get booted and have a 20 minute queue
[16976.57s -> 16979.93s]  How about this dru crew? Let's let's do some bargaining here
[16980.81s -> 16982.25s]  dru crew
[16982.25s -> 16984.28s]  I've come to bargain
[16984.28s -> 16986.28s]  I want to play
[16987.39s -> 16989.39s]  nancy dru and the ice wolf
[16992.64s -> 16993.96s]  on
[16993.96s -> 16996.27s]  Thursday of next week
[16997.66s -> 17004.67s]  You understand me? Oh, no, that's resident evil 4. Um
[17007.69s -> 17018.57s]  Fuck you think you guys might be in a little bit of trouble here. How about this dru crew?
[17019.13s -> 17022.17s]  I'll tell you
[17022.17s -> 17027.21s]  If I don't play nancy dru and the ice wolf, whatever that game was that we were playing earlier
[17028.78s -> 17036.12s]  By the end of march 31st, I will delete my twitch channel. Okay, there you go
[17037.23s -> 17041.79s]  If I do not play dru crew in the icicle wolf, whatever that game that we played earlier, I will um
[17044.27s -> 17045.95s]  That's a bad thing to say
[17045.95s -> 17047.15s]  Okay, yes
[17047.15s -> 17051.80s]  I'll just play it before the okay wipe that bet wipe that deal
[17052.28s -> 17054.60s]  I will just play it before the 31st
[17055.16s -> 17057.24s]  Of march of this year. There you go
[17068.03s -> 17070.03s]  Dru crew accepts
[17077.29s -> 17079.29s]  Uh, what was I supposed to do?
[17079.37s -> 17081.37s]  Oh find her husband
[17081.77s -> 17088.64s]  It might be worth checking out the multiplayer say at work
[17089.28s -> 17093.68s]  Although i'm gonna have to add a few people though
[17094.32s -> 17102.43s]  Did I level up again?
[17102.43s -> 17112.14s]  Oh, I like that more damage more duration
[17113.50s -> 17123.74s]  What do you guys think? I think it's a pretty good escape wills in a party right now
[17124.84s -> 17126.84s]  Uh, well, whatever figure it
[17127.00s -> 17132.81s]  We'll figure it out. I think I want more damage
[17133.37s -> 17137.44s]  Because this move actually and you don't have to stand still that's okay. Just just checking to make sure
[17138.16s -> 17142.49s]  All right. Where is your husband?
[17142.49s -> 17144.41s]  Are you really gonna go all fire?
[17144.41s -> 17146.41s]  I'm gonna go mostly fire
[17158.70s -> 17164.86s]  Fire sorceress is one thing I never really did in diablo 2 so i'm going to fix that and do it in diablo 4
[17165.42s -> 17169.37s]  Are you gonna explain to the that group that you only have three skills?
[17170.17s -> 17171.53s]  I'm not gonna
[17171.53s -> 17174.59s]  I'm not gonna say that
[17174.59s -> 17176.75s]  But who cares if I only have three skills. They're very powerful
[17177.39s -> 17181.07s]  It doesn't matter. You know, hey here's the nature of diablo
[17184.33s -> 17187.05s]  This I make my build you make your build if you want
[17187.37s -> 17191.29s]  You want a whole hot bar of moves and you don't just want three fire abilities in that then you do it
[17191.85s -> 17196.28s]  Good luck
[17196.28s -> 17199.48s]  Good luck. Oh my god
[17201.04s -> 17203.04s]  My sweet fedor
[17204.09s -> 17206.41s]  May you know bliss fedor
[17207.37s -> 17209.37s]  What has happened
[17210.01s -> 17212.01s]  Well, don't let don't let her run
[17212.17s -> 17215.18s]  What did a little run?
[17215.34s -> 17218.32s]  Such sights I have witnessed
[17219.28s -> 17221.37s]  such pleasure
[17221.37s -> 17223.47s]  such pain
[17223.47s -> 17225.80s]  I must have
[17225.80s -> 17228.17s]  more
[17230.73s -> 17238.11s]  How is it that you more please go after that woman who did this to him
[17240.96s -> 17242.96s]  More more more
[17243.52s -> 17250.17s]  I'm gonna leave you two to sort this up
[17250.49s -> 17258.08s]  And i'm gonna go this way
[17258.08s -> 17261.36s]  It's no surprise fedor was drawn to me
[17262.64s -> 17266.64s]  But I have given only what was desired
[17270.08s -> 17275.78s]  His petty soul has been torn asunder by agony and ecstasy
[17276.64s -> 17279.14s]  But his flesh is unyielding
[17281.12s -> 17283.12s]  He will not interfere
[17285.29s -> 17315.76s]  Uh, i'm gonna go back over there. Uh, I don't I don't really want to know what's over there
[17332.70s -> 17338.22s]  You you deserve much worse than the mercy I have just shown you
[17338.94s -> 17350.03s]  That woman was demon. I have dealt with her if it's a reward you want
[17350.67s -> 17352.67s]  Take the dagger from his chest
[17353.47s -> 17355.47s]  And leave me be
[17367.44s -> 17373.32s]  Oh shit
[17387.08s -> 17388.68s]  Help him
[17388.68s -> 17389.96s]  Help him
[17389.96s -> 17420.27s]  10 more damage to injured enemies 10 11 is a basic skill damage. I don't think it's better than this
[17423.37s -> 17428.41s]  Neither this staff is actually really good. I get a plus damage increase to anything
[17428.89s -> 17442.24s]  Doesn't matter how close or how far away. I think i'll hold on to that. Yeah, I think that sounds good
[17448.84s -> 17450.84s]  That was an interesting quest
[17451.56s -> 17454.38s]  Any advice on how to stop slouching?
[17454.38s -> 17461.05s]  Um, not really but i'll tell you a little tip every I would say in between
[17461.45s -> 17464.97s]  Okay, let's say you're playing let's say playing apex legends, right?
[17465.77s -> 17466.73s]  drop
[17466.73s -> 17468.73s]  Got 100 people that you have to fight
[17468.73s -> 17472.09s]  You get that guy you get that one you get that person boom. You're in the top 10
[17472.65s -> 17474.09s]  you got
[17474.09s -> 17476.09s]  Set nine people running around
[17476.17s -> 17480.73s]  Ah, you got sniped from the window, but you nice nice fucking work. Nice job. You did it
[17481.79s -> 17484.09s]  After every round just sit up
[17484.73s -> 17486.73s]  Sit up after every run
[17487.50s -> 17491.74s]  Just make it clear that every time that you are gonna get and that was a who cares
[17492.54s -> 17505.85s]  Okay, all right going this way just make a conscious effort
[17506.73s -> 17508.41s]  every so often
[17508.41s -> 17510.97s]  Every 20 30 minutes or so or like 40 minutes
[17512.00s -> 17514.08s]  Correct it. That's what I do. You see it happen all the time
[17515.20s -> 17517.84s]  How many times you see me just kind of move and go wait a minute. Hold on
[17518.97s -> 17520.97s]  Re-adjust and stay that way
[17529.15s -> 17532.67s]  Who cares? No, I didn't mean that. I just mean like who cares about that story. I was telling
[17533.31s -> 17541.69s]  All right. The fireball is kind of destructive
[17542.33s -> 17547.18s]  A lot of people didn't believe in that
[17547.26s -> 17549.26s]  I'm a dental assistant
[17551.02s -> 17553.98s]  Um, so yeah, does everything just after you do the teeth?
[17554.94s -> 17561.90s]  Um work then just kind of sit up for a little bit stretch a little bit you get nice target ass shirt
[17563.20s -> 17565.20s]  Don't know where I got this shirt
[17565.44s -> 17567.44s]  All you can do is speculate
[17581.40s -> 17583.45s]  Ooh
[17583.45s -> 17585.80s]  Ring
[17585.80s -> 17598.92s]  Do anything with this?
[17599.00s -> 17606.54s]  So it's close range this far away range. Is there a medium range?
[17610.48s -> 17612.48s]  Got that shirt kids are us
[17612.48s -> 17614.16s]  Rafflecopter
[17614.16s -> 17621.45s]  Behold the truths that lie within
[17621.69s -> 17626.64s]  Try to do anything with this stuff. There's something strange going on here
[17627.77s -> 17634.43s]  They around must be nearby
[17634.43s -> 17636.43s]  Who the fuck just said rafflecopter?
[17636.75s -> 17644.38s]  Come on, dude
[17644.38s -> 17647.45s]  All right search
[17647.69s -> 17651.34s]  Am I the right level for this place? Yeah
[17654.96s -> 17657.04s]  Oh somebody wanted to see this i'll show it to you
[17658.08s -> 17665.10s]  You're still here
[17665.10s -> 17667.10s]  Is there a place to see the?
[17670.36s -> 17673.00s]  Um the difficulties or is it a different menu?
[17673.72s -> 17685.50s]  We've had the mcdonald's shamrock shake
[17686.30s -> 17687.26s]  uh
[17687.26s -> 17689.26s]  Yeah, i've had a sip or two of it
[17689.26s -> 17693.18s]  one of those items where you can only have one sip or two sips before you just like
[17694.06s -> 17696.06s]  Just never want to drink it ever again
[17696.06s -> 17698.06s]  But those three or four sips
[17698.86s -> 17710.08s]  Are delicious the first sip of a shamrock shake is
[17710.96s -> 17713.39s]  This is the greatest thing i've ever had in my life
[17713.55s -> 17715.79s]  There's nothing nothing will ever compare to how good this tastes
[17716.75s -> 17718.43s]  sip two
[17718.43s -> 17720.43s]  Is kind of mostly just sugar flavor
[17721.85s -> 17724.81s]  Sip three is this is the best thing i've ever had in my whole life again
[17725.85s -> 17729.45s]  And then sip five hurts and makes me kind of want to like put it down
[17742.86s -> 17745.53s]  mist for
[17745.53s -> 17759.23s]  Exactly
[17759.23s -> 17761.23s]  Sip four is between you and god
[17761.23s -> 17763.23s]  That's right
[17769.08s -> 17771.52s]  We don't talk about sip four
[17771.52s -> 17799.42s]  We don't discuss sip four
[17799.42s -> 17801.42s]  I do appreciate that that thought
[17801.96s -> 17803.96s]  Shows you if it's going to kill them
[17811.00s -> 17818.40s]  If you're not out of shake by sip four you're doing it wrong
[17821.93s -> 17840.76s]  That depends
[17840.76s -> 17842.36s]  Sips or gulps
[17842.36s -> 17844.73s]  Well, that's what I was saying to you guys earlier
[17844.73s -> 17846.01s]  drinking water
[17846.01s -> 17850.88s]  Sometimes I can drink a water
[17851.04s -> 17852.40s]  Faster than anything
[17852.40s -> 17855.92s]  All right, where am I going here?
[17865.77s -> 17875.16s]  All right this way what temperature do you like your water at water to me needs to be
[17876.46s -> 17879.10s]  Just above room temperature
[17879.82s -> 17881.42s]  It's not cold
[17881.42s -> 17883.34s]  above room temp
[17883.34s -> 17889.85s]  but maybe something like
[17890.56s -> 17893.76s]  Oh, no, no, no below below below. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry below just below
[17897.45s -> 17900.76s]  Just below room temp
[17900.76s -> 17904.76s]  So let's say room temp is somewhere between what like sixty eight seventy
[17909.56s -> 17915.16s]  I like a like a sixty degree like fifty to sixty degrees created by the horror
[17916.46s -> 17921.48s]  The portal will lead you through this crude nancy
[17926.97s -> 17932.22s]  the ice wolf
[17932.22s -> 17934.80s]  Okay
[17934.80s -> 17942.41s]  chest
[17942.41s -> 17946.65s]  Relax no harm will come to you here. Who is this?
[17955.96s -> 17961.00s]  Who are you n of sorts?
[17962.04s -> 17964.04s]  I saved you in the mountains
[17964.76s -> 17968.36s]  You'd lost your horse and crawled into that cave
[17969.32s -> 17971.72s]  Would have frozen to death if not for me
[17974.46s -> 17976.46s]  Why are you helping me?
[17977.02s -> 17978.86s]  Oh, it's very simple
[17978.86s -> 17982.62s]  You want to stop lilith and I want you to succeed
[17983.42s -> 17986.78s]  But you'll never do that by following the whole rotrim
[17994.58s -> 17998.90s]  Their path always ends in fire and death
[18000.50s -> 18007.03s]  So what is this path exactly seems pretty fiery and seems pretty deadly seen enough
[18008.15s -> 18014.63s]  Open the door. Uh, you don't bring people here
[18015.78s -> 18017.78s]  and say that you know, you gotta
[18018.26s -> 18022.18s]  You've got to clean this place up a little bit before you say it's not fire and death over here
[18022.82s -> 18038.12s]  It's a cool looking place though
[18038.12s -> 18040.12s]  Why are you telling me all this?
[18041.08s -> 18043.06s]  to warn you
[18043.06s -> 18046.34s]  A day will come when the horodrum stumble
[18047.54s -> 18050.82s]  Don't be there when they do it's gonna be diablo
[18052.60s -> 18056.44s]  The portal will lead you to that little girl you're looking for
[18057.56s -> 18068.78s]  I like the world the way it was
[18069.82s -> 18071.82s]  without lilith
[18072.14s -> 18076.38s]  A little game of rebellion will only lead to chaos
[18077.34s -> 18080.86s]  You've already seen visions of the damage she can do
[18083.46s -> 18086.50s]  Yes, I know you were fed her blood
[18087.38s -> 18089.46s]  Do you feel it changing you?
[18090.50s -> 18092.34s]  Perhaps not yet
[18092.34s -> 18095.54s]  But as long as lilith walks in your world
[18096.26s -> 18098.34s]  It is only a matter of time
[18105.67s -> 18107.13s]  Tristram
[18107.45s -> 18114.09s]  The horodrum of old imprisoned diablo the lord of terror beneath the earth
[18115.21s -> 18117.85s]  And then they built this town nearby
[18122.22s -> 18124.46s]  You can see how that turned out
[18134.86s -> 18136.22s]  This worked
[18136.22s -> 18148.87s]  Okay, let's go back in the horodrums illusion
[18149.59s -> 18151.59s]  illusion
[18151.59s -> 18156.07s]  What are you hiding?
[18156.07s -> 18157.35s]  nairo
[18157.35s -> 18159.35s]  There you are. All right, let's go
[18161.83s -> 18165.75s]  I think i've lost my way the same thing happened to my mother and me earlier on
[18167.32s -> 18171.56s]  The trail to the vault ends here. So it should be somewhere around in these woods
[18177.14s -> 18179.94s]  Find the way to the horodric vault
[18188.79s -> 18193.59s]  Someone toying with us. This place is amazing. Oh, I should have held on to that
[18195.35s -> 18205.83s]  We need time to prepare
[18206.71s -> 18211.34s]  Where they go
[18211.34s -> 18214.30s]  All right, punch everybody up punch everybody up punch punch punch punch
[18240.78s -> 18243.10s]  You actually despawned them. Oh
[18245.85s -> 18250.42s]  What the heck?
[18250.42s -> 18255.10s]  How does it feel so far?
[18255.10s -> 18258.18s]  It feels good to play
[18258.18s -> 18261.38s]  I do like
[18261.38s -> 18263.82s]  Okay, i'm gonna give you a take
[18263.82s -> 18268.22s]  one of the things I really like about these kinds of games, especially like d2 and
[18269.02s -> 18272.26s]  um others
[18272.26s -> 18274.34s]  I played grim dawn. I did
[18274.34s -> 18275.30s]  and
[18275.30s -> 18277.30s]  I'm gonna pick my nose on camera
[18278.22s -> 18282.38s]  I really didn't like in d3 and I know this is people are gonna say what's the difference
[18282.86s -> 18285.02s]  It doesn't matter. You can just respec or whatever
[18285.74s -> 18287.74s]  But having access to every single
[18288.36s -> 18289.78s]  ability
[18289.78s -> 18296.49s]  Every single one and you can just kind of if you make a barbarian you are every barbarian if you want to be
[18297.54s -> 18300.98s]  And it's only you diablo 3 really relied on you finding
[18301.54s -> 18303.05s]  a set
[18303.05s -> 18305.93s]  That had some crazy modifier to something
[18307.86s -> 18309.86s]  But I like so far
[18310.34s -> 18313.61s]  That you have to pick stuff
[18313.77s -> 18314.81s]  And it's
[18314.81s -> 18319.69s]  I guess permanent unless you refund it which it looks like I wonder if I do this. It's four gold. It probably
[18320.94s -> 18326.74s]  Will go higher i'm imagining so I don't know if that's the accurate who knows but I like the fact that if you make a
[18327.30s -> 18329.14s]  a sorceress or wizard or
[18329.14s -> 18330.42s]  A barbarian
[18330.42s -> 18334.98s]  It's not not every barbarians the same barbarian because I can just do the moves you're doing if I really feel like it
[18334.98s -> 18341.13s]  I can just swap them out. Um, I like building characters. I like making a wizard for instance
[18342.49s -> 18345.45s]  That I have to make two I have to make three I have to make five
[18346.15s -> 18350.71s]  I have to make 10 to experience some of the all the builds that I would like to experience
[18350.95s -> 18358.33s]  I like it more that way now. You could say well, you're just kind of adding more unnecessary time
[18359.13s -> 18364.54s]  But I like that. I kind of like having permanent decisions that maybe they're not completely permanent
[18364.62s -> 18374.57s]  But they're permanent and i'm talking to my channel. I wanted to be permanent this dude's waffling
[18375.59s -> 18396.01s]  I don't think so. What is right here because I can do it. He's talking to his kids. Is that rare?
[18396.81s -> 18406.70s]  That was like bold letters. I kind of like being able to make
[18407.40s -> 18413.59s]  Mistakes or make characters that are kind of maybe unconventional that are just strange
[18414.82s -> 18419.62s]  That maybe they're not the most powerful but you can still do it and maybe you find items that make it fun to do
[18423.34s -> 18427.10s]  the ruins in d3 were interesting, but it really did feel like
[18427.90s -> 18430.30s]  and this is probably likely to happen here, too, but
[18432.57s -> 18436.57s]  It was there were a few ruins that were just so good. It was unbelievably good
[18437.29s -> 18464.17s]  And why would you pick anything else? Uh, what I have to do pray give thanks. Hello. I appreciate that
[18466.39s -> 18468.39s]  Nice, what is this?
[18469.75s -> 18477.08s]  elixir of what
[18477.08s -> 18481.16s]  Increases lucky hit chance by 30% in an experience gained for 30 minutes
[18481.72s -> 18485.11s]  Oh, I can't even use these
[18485.11s -> 18498.02s]  That's pretty cool. I like unique gear. I like collecting stuff and I like making characters that other people might not have
[18498.98s -> 18502.98s]  Yes
[18502.98s -> 18505.14s]  Diablo 2 shout barbarians come to mind
[18505.78s -> 18511.05s]  Ocean find barbarians come to mind if you got into a game where there was a potion find barbarian
[18512.17s -> 18513.53s]  It was just like
[18513.53s -> 18518.81s]  Ah, you're okay. You're a weirdo and that's okay. That's all right
[18520.09s -> 18522.73s]  It was it was kind of interesting. It's a grandpa take. That's fine
[18527.80s -> 18536.50s]  now obviously diablo 2 was it with things that you should do it with things that were just crazy and
[18537.06s -> 18540.34s]  you'd see a lot of sorceresses running around with frozen orb or
[18541.30s -> 18543.30s]  Like nova was
[18543.36s -> 18545.36s]  unbelievably good for a while
[18545.62s -> 18547.62s]  But you still could do the other stuff and it was still
[18552.78s -> 18557.24s]  You're muted
[18557.24s -> 18559.24s]  What I just said a bunch of stuff
[18562.04s -> 18567.13s]  Who we're going in here?
[18567.13s -> 18569.13s]  Summoner was op
[18569.13s -> 18573.78s]  Like we're gonna boot it now
[18574.58s -> 18577.30s]  Summoning necromancer was so it was just so goofy
[18577.30s -> 18580.58s]  I don't know how you do that now
[18581.54s -> 18585.93s]  Because I think the technology might not be able to handle
[18587.48s -> 18592.92s]  Hundreds if not, you know two or three hundred if you got three or four necromancers in a game
[18593.00s -> 18595.00s]  Maybe it would just break the server. I don't know
[18598.52s -> 18621.05s]  How is he not noticed what are you talking about everyone say one I win is that the only thing in here
[18621.93s -> 18630.06s]  missed experience
[18630.06s -> 18632.38s]  Featured peaks total real never known
[18634.25s -> 18641.08s]  Whoa, what's this?
[18641.08s -> 18647.14s]  Just got 3 000 gold in the skill point. Holy shit
[18650.92s -> 18657.34s]  All right, one skill point is way way way way has been added for all characters on this realm
[18662.47s -> 18680.38s]  I did that want the movement speed. This is good, too. It's all your characters, too
[18680.78s -> 18682.78s]  How are they gonna handle that?
[18682.78s -> 18687.62s]  Does that just cap out at some point?
[18687.62s -> 18698.65s]  I have to imagine that that would get kind of weird after a while only a certain number per region
[18699.05s -> 18708.33s]  It's just the characters you own
[18709.61s -> 18716.62s]  You did that I did that so you don't have to replay everything
[18717.18s -> 18729.85s]  Compound. Oh, okay. Is there a town hub? Looks like there's quite a few of them show the map
[18730.41s -> 18758.23s]  We might be getting booted here. I think so. I think we're getting booted
[18758.79s -> 18797.80s]  I'll give it 30 more seconds. So then i'm gonna restart it 10 seconds 10 seconds messed up
[18800.60s -> 18811.34s]  Uh, I hope I don't lose progress or something. I was wondering why my room was hotter
[18812.41s -> 18822.74s]  It's because I have two games open running at the same time. I was wondering like why is it so hot in here?
[18822.90s -> 18832.42s]  Let's try to get in the queue again
[18841.91s -> 18852.10s]  Nancy drew is definitely not running the gpu hot. Yeah, but it's still operating. We've got a long one here
[18852.34s -> 18855.99s]  In fact, we might not even
[18856.15s -> 18864.39s]  Do this anymore. It's 20 minutes in the queue. We might just be doing drew crew for a little while
[18868.47s -> 18883.26s]  Let's see. Can you see nancy drew the problem with playing two games at the same time is I need to remember what the hell
[18883.26s -> 18889.21s]  We just did an hour and 25 minutes ago. That's the hard part
[18895.99s -> 18921.03s]  Hmm
[18921.03s -> 18932.62s]  I'm just gonna tell uh, tell will and I just got a big pretty big queue. So
[18946.28s -> 18966.73s]  I how do you spell queue? It's such a weird word to spell then i'm gonna i'm gonna do an emote
[18967.05s -> 18974.79s]  What's a good emote to do the sideways crying laughing face?
[18976.66s -> 18978.65s]  Zany
[18978.65s -> 19008.70s]  I was gonna put bugleberry in here. All right, nancy. What are we what are we doing? Where were the those?
[19009.18s -> 19012.78s]  They were playing that game and they were saying hey fix the lake, please
[19013.18s -> 19039.13s]  Where was that wasn't it here? It was here. Maybe they went out to the lake should I go upstairs going to their rooms?
[19042.01s -> 19073.94s]  This shoot is for dirty laundry. Do I have to do the match the colors or something? What was it red?
[19078.22s -> 19101.62s]  Red blue then green it was it was like certain colors, right? Definitely to get this right. Nobody has an actual
[19102.58s -> 19114.44s]  Key thing on their door emergency exit only cold warning
[19117.32s -> 19121.64s]  I shouldn't open this door unless I absolutely have to put the key in your bag and use it on the door
[19127.34s -> 19143.78s]  Oh, okay, what do you got in here rudimentary geology structural engineering
[19146.82s -> 19179.56s]  Large machinery safety protocol make the bed. What about this? Wait a minute. Hold on back over there. We're coming
[19182.18s -> 19187.26s]  Shoot, I can't clean this room yet. I don't have anything to put the dirty laundry in the chute
[19189.19s -> 19192.58s]  What do I need a basket?
[19192.98s -> 19194.98s]  That's not scary music
[19197.82s -> 19199.34s]  The diablo q
[19199.34s -> 19221.06s]  Can I open this? I cannot well, what about whatever's going on? I need a laundry basket or something, right?
[19222.22s -> 19238.18s]  I've been so itchy today hates to lose expected to win and I always did
[19238.84s -> 19244.66s]  Knowing your enemy is the surest way to defeat them. I know some of my competition is better than I know
[19246.44s -> 19252.73s]  Myself
[19252.73s -> 19260.26s]  Some believe he studies his competitors so he can eliminate them. Why is she on a rifle?
[19262.47s -> 19286.70s]  Environmental champion. I have long bobs tip of the month. Shoot. I can't clean this room. I need a laundry basket
[19286.70s -> 19293.99s]  I'm not doing this till I get a laundry basket. Is there a staff room or something I can get to
[19295.53s -> 19297.53s]  That's not what goes here
[19300.10s -> 19304.55s]  I need a laundry basket. Is there like a staff room or a
[19318.34s -> 19319.96s]  Contents deleted
[19319.96s -> 19327.30s]  Wonder why from last year? Interesting
[19328.42s -> 19336.18s]  Okay, pick up laundry bag at the front desk available after 5 45 a.m
[19336.42s -> 19388.10s]  But I took too long. Well, isn't this the front desk? We're sorry. I won the jackpot
[19388.34s -> 19424.63s]  Check the number and dial again might as well leave a message. Hi sheriff. It's Nancy Drew. Nothing urgent
[19424.79s -> 19429.91s]  I'm just kind of checking in. So if I don't hear from you, I'll call you back later. Bye. Okay
[19430.47s -> 19433.27s]  All right. What about uh, Tino Balducci?
[19441.59s -> 19443.59s]  That was a pointless message
[19445.80s -> 19463.86s]  I didn't catch you but whoops, I'll try again. I'm not sure helped is the right word. Mr. Balducci
[19466.31s -> 19474.79s]  In fact Tino i'm a little surprised you're still in law enforcement considering some of the unethical if not illegal stunts you pulled back then
[19485.42s -> 19487.02s]  looks like
[19487.02s -> 19516.09s]  I'm curious. How do you know shantel? We're gonna get intel. How many clients do you have?
[19519.90s -> 19521.90s]  One large pepperoni
[19537.24s -> 19538.20s]  Okay
[19538.20s -> 19550.33s]  I better go. That's a lot of pause. No get I want to leave the phone
[19551.75s -> 19564.10s]  How do I put the phone down?
[19564.10s -> 19576.62s]  This please call me five five five
[19577.10s -> 19596.34s]  Okay, two three eight three two three eight three. What's the area? What's the code?
[19602.12s -> 19635.58s]  Can you do mario? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I got I did it. We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed
[19635.98s -> 19644.25s]  Please check the number and dial again the recording. I did it. I'm really high. I don't understand
[19644.25s -> 19646.57s]  Why does he keep dialing numbers? Oh, no
[19648.68s -> 19652.73s]  Oh, no. Um
[19652.73s -> 19654.73s]  Let's relax for a little bit
[19655.98s -> 19658.30s]  Just just chill. There's no reason to
[19659.10s -> 19661.90s]  Looks like elsa was having major boyfriend problems
[19663.91s -> 19669.86s]  Dude, I can't watch it
[19669.94s -> 19676.50s]  Sorry, this is a laundry basket. How is this not a lot? Oh
[19677.14s -> 19685.64s]  Give me this
[19685.64s -> 19686.92s]  Dear elsa
[19686.92s -> 19692.84s]  This time when I read it when I this time when I read in your letter saying you weren't coming
[19693.16s -> 19695.16s]  I didn't get sad. I got mad
[19695.16s -> 19697.16s]  I can't believe you think working as a stupid
[19697.48s -> 19702.92s]  Made it some stupid lodge for some stupid lady whose name I can't even pronounce is more important than spending time with me
[19703.62s -> 19706.02s]  If I didn't love you so much I tell you to go
[19706.58s -> 19707.78s]  Take a flying leap
[19707.78s -> 19712.58s]  But since I love you more than anything i'll just have to do something else like maybe take your precious collection of troll dolls out
[19712.58s -> 19718.18s]  Of the box you store in my garage and dump them down the disposal or maybe i'll sell them on ebay for a nickel
[19718.26s -> 19719.38s]  I have a piece
[19719.38s -> 19722.66s]  I don't know how else to make you understand that I love you with all my heart and I always will
[19726.26s -> 19744.41s]  That was a review for valorant. Okay, I need to go upstairs. All right
[19746.01s -> 19757.75s]  Jesus what happened? They have to have the thing on the door. There we go. All right, let's go in here
[19757.99s -> 19765.18s]  I got the laundry bag now clean up the room put the laundry in the laundry bag
[19776.36s -> 19783.99s]  Okay laundry very nice you want laundry done as well
[19784.31s -> 19808.79s]  Everybody else have any laundry it was just these two. I think that's it
[19809.03s -> 19821.21s]  It was only people that had the thing on there. That's it. Right? There's two more rooms for you to do
[19825.86s -> 19837.05s]  How do I go get that thing back? I got this. No, no, no, no, this is correct, right?
[19845.86s -> 19848.98s]  That's not what goes here. I gotta go. I gotta go get it
[19849.86s -> 19879.11s]  Whatever. I don't even care. What's the what's the next task to do? What's the task need something? You look busy. What are you making?
[19879.59s -> 19883.99s]  I'm building something. It's gonna solve all our problems a wolf trap one
[19883.99s -> 19891.11s]  That'll finish off that thing out there once and for all you think the wolf is causing the accidents not a doubt in my mind
[19891.67s -> 19894.63s]  Everything was a okay till it showed up and started howling
[19895.19s -> 19897.91s]  It's bad luck and something's protecting it
[19898.55s -> 19902.63s]  Something unnatural does mizma weakway know you're doing this
[19903.03s -> 19909.27s]  She knows she doesn't want that thing around her guests and you heard her i'm supposed to do whatever I think is necessary to get rid of it
[19911.45s -> 19916.97s]  But it's not like it's attacking people what's wrong with this wolf yesterday. I went looking for it
[19917.53s -> 19923.53s]  I tracked it and finally found it sitting across the creek not 20 yards away from me. Just staring at me
[19924.09s -> 19927.61s]  So I raised my rifle drew a bead and fired
[19928.17s -> 19932.97s]  Easiest shot i've ever taken in my life, but why though missed so I fired again
[19933.37s -> 19939.77s]  And I missed and then I missed again and again and all the while it just sat there staring until finally it just stood up
[19940.17s -> 19944.89s]  Walked toward the brush just as calm as could be and disappeared wild animals
[19944.97s -> 19948.09s]  Just don't act like that and I just don't miss like that
[19948.57s -> 19952.89s]  There's something real weird about that wolf and I ain't gonna rest till I get rid of it
[19953.13s -> 19957.13s]  So maybe we should just find something else to jaw about you met my little girl yet
[19957.69s -> 19962.65s]  No, but you mentioned that her name is freddy. Yep spends most of her time outside
[19963.05s -> 19965.05s]  She built herself a little snow for it
[19965.29s -> 19969.53s]  Just sits out there waiting for somebody to go by so she can pick a snowball fight with him
[19970.01s -> 19974.01s]  I keep asking her how she manages to stay warm all day, but she won't tell me
[19974.65s -> 19976.65s]  Says she's got a secret weapon
[19977.13s -> 19979.13s]  Yeah, she's something
[19979.69s -> 19981.69s]  Why do we care about this wolf who's
[19983.34s -> 19988.60s]  Who cares?
[19988.60s -> 19991.64s]  Do we think the wolf is the one dropping the grenades?
[19992.87s -> 19994.71s]  It's a magic wolf
[19994.71s -> 20005.11s]  Why do we want to kill the magic wolf? I mean it growled at me. Yeah wild animal would do that if you approached it
[20007.75s -> 20009.75s]  Why are we gonna kill a magic wolf?
[20010.34s -> 20017.24s]  Why wouldn't we want to how long have you worked for shantel if it grants us wishes or something?
[20017.48s -> 20021.24s]  I was her first hire best hire too. I could run this place
[20021.24s -> 20025.32s]  I'm telling you you just take you throw like one raw chicken at it and it'll grant us all wishes
[20025.72s -> 20031.74s]  Just one just one like raw turkey and the thing will be like, oh, thank you
[20032.06s -> 20035.75s]  By the way, how much money do you want in your bank accounts tomorrow?
[20036.31s -> 20040.36s]  It's a magical wolf
[20040.36s -> 20044.36s]  Have you ever been in the guest lodge business before I tried my hand at it once
[20045.08s -> 20050.44s]  Long story short didn't work out, but i've learned a whole lot since then I could make it work now
[20050.84s -> 20054.44s]  Just need to find the right property get my hands on enough cash to make a down payment
[20054.52s -> 20060.20s]  Is your wife freddy's mom does she live here is your wife freddy's mom does she live here too
[20060.68s -> 20063.56s]  In the summer she does but in the winter she goes south though
[20063.56s -> 20067.00s]  I don't know her name this nerve condition that makes her real sensitive to cold
[20067.40s -> 20071.40s]  freddy'd like to go with her but until shantel stops putting off giving me that rage
[20071.40s -> 20074.60s]  She promised me sending freddy south too is out of the question
[20078.41s -> 20082.89s]  Can you tell me more about the accidents that have been happening around here? Nope sure can
[20084.63s -> 20092.07s]  Hmm you can't or you don't want to shantana those lawyers or her said I couldn't talk about them supposed to direct all questions to her
[20092.55s -> 20097.88s]  Sorry
[20097.88s -> 20102.44s]  Have you seen that strange concrete monument thing that's out there on the trail kind of weird
[20103.64s -> 20107.48s]  course
[20107.48s -> 20111.32s]  Is there a way to get into it? Do you know don't know don't really care
[20111.72s -> 20115.08s]  Maybe something in that display up in the lobby will tell you what you want to know
[20115.72s -> 20122.04s]  Did you know there was an avalanche at chicken ridge sure didn't not surprised though you call the avalanche patrol
[20123.59s -> 20125.59s]  I thought I'd tell you about it first
[20125.83s -> 20129.67s]  You better give those employee instructions I left in your room another look report
[20131.35s -> 20133.66s]  Oops, sorry
[20133.66s -> 20138.74s]  No, my bad
[20138.74s -> 20145.43s]  And you should probably start drinking fucking four fingers of whiskey before you go out to hunt the magic scary wolf
[20146.15s -> 20151.62s]  Looks like we both have things to do. I'd better get back upstairs
[20152.18s -> 20157.94s]  By the way, you dumped the laundry bag before all the rooms were cleaned. So I'll put it back up at the front desk
[20159.34s -> 20160.46s]  Oh
[20160.46s -> 20168.89s]  Okay. All right. All right. All right, so I have to call the avalanche people. This is so invigorating
[20173.24s -> 20175.24s]  This is so invigorating
[20180.17s -> 20192.36s]  Um, I don't know why this keeps happening. All right, I had that was
[20195.56s -> 20197.56s]  Nancy i'm glad to see you
[20198.41s -> 20203.85s]  Are you all right? You're okay upset. You must listen. I was outside skiing very fast
[20204.17s -> 20210.57s]  As usual and suddenly boom snow dirt rocks everything went flying into the air right in front of me
[20210.81s -> 20212.81s]  There is a mad bomber on the loose
[20213.05s -> 20216.89s]  Was anybody I saw no one not before not after
[20217.45s -> 20224.89s]  My competitors bombed the bunkhouse thinking I would be so frightened that I would abandon my training and leave only I wasn't frightened
[20225.13s -> 20227.13s]  So now they are trying to bomb me
[20229.29s -> 20234.33s]  Uh, okay, do you think they're responsible for all the accidents that have been happening around here as well?
[20234.73s -> 20241.13s]  My competitors and the governance behind them. They are as desperate as they are ruthless. They're capable of anything
[20241.37s -> 20244.97s]  They can operate anywhere in the world under all conditions
[20245.21s -> 20249.77s]  It would not surprise me if someone right here in the lodge is right now under their employ
[20250.09s -> 20255.69s]  But to them I say pa they do not scare me. I'm the best cross-country skier in the world
[20255.93s -> 20261.29s]  I will neutralize their petty threats with my excellent strength skill and speed
[20261.53s -> 20265.05s]  What is this very why are you so mad what are my problems did you want
[20271.50s -> 20276.86s]  All right, have you seen the wolf in the wolf while you were out training? No for which i'm very grateful
[20277.34s -> 20282.70s]  In my country in fredonia. It is said that the gaze of the wolf will make you go blind
[20283.88s -> 20289.16s]  Really they are creatures of infinite evil and that is all i'm going to say on the matter
[20291.46s -> 20294.42s]  You're busy. So i'll let you go keviche naya
[20294.98s -> 20298.30s]  i'm telling you it's just
[20298.30s -> 20301.78s]  I hate this sound effect
[20301.78s -> 20304.90s]  All right. So we have to go do the laundry thing. I got a call about the avalanche
[20307.14s -> 20310.34s]  I don't think I think diablo is is completely done by the way
[20313.05s -> 20316.65s]  I've been sitting here and it says queued and it's just not doing anything. So i'm just gonna close it
[20317.29s -> 20319.46s]  So we're not gonna play any more diablo
[20320.28s -> 20321.42s]  unfortunate
[20321.42s -> 20323.42s]  I had it was fun. It was fun. I just
[20323.74s -> 20325.74s]  Obviously wish it worked more often
[20326.38s -> 20328.42s]  but um
[20328.42s -> 20330.42s]  I enjoyed it. I think it's gonna be
[20332.06s -> 20335.67s]  I don't know. I can't tell you only know is that it was fun for the
[20336.23s -> 20338.23s]  Three or four hours. I got to actually play it
[20344.06s -> 20348.30s]  I cannot give you a judgment on it because it's hard to do that so early into a game that is
[20349.10s -> 20352.02s]  Potentially hundreds of hours of things that you need to do in it
[20352.74s -> 20357.30s]  But I will tell you that it felt a little it felt better than the way that I felt about d3
[20358.52s -> 20360.84s]  And way better than I feel about diablo immortal. So
[20361.64s -> 20363.64s]  It was good. I thought it was fine
[20363.96s -> 20378.70s]  We'll see
[20378.78s -> 20381.02s]  Okay, I need to go back to the front desk
[20381.02s -> 20385.37s]  I gotta make a few phone calls
[20385.37s -> 20387.37s]  All right. What was it? It was
[20387.37s -> 20390.84s]  Who do I call?
[20390.84s -> 20393.78s]  I called the sheriff and it was just like oh, I don't care. Leave me alone
[20395.27s -> 20405.40s]  What what I have to call the who do I call ghostbusters? I actually watched afterlife, uh very recently
[20418.09s -> 20428.28s]  Who do I report this to is there another number lying around somewhere? I'm a senior detective
[20428.36s -> 20445.43s]  I don't need a task list phone numbers. There it is. Okay 403. It's been an avalanche
[20445.91s -> 20458.02s]  I'm calling from the icicle creek lodge, but I wanted to report an avalanche at chicken ridge
[20459.78s -> 20474.44s]  Uh, not anymore the handyman here at the lodge. He's also on the patrol explosives training
[20474.68s -> 20483.98s]  Sometimes the patrol has to i'll tell him appreciate it one more thing
[20484.30s -> 20491.42s]  Have any of you guys been setting off explosives anywhere near the icicle creek lodge recently? Liar. Thanks. Bye
[20493.69s -> 20495.69s]  He has an old-timey radio cadence
[20498.31s -> 20501.43s]  Okay, so we did that now I need to
[20502.07s -> 20505.58s]  Close this
[20505.58s -> 20512.54s]  Get the laundry bag again. Is it lunchtime or is dinner? I don't know. I'm not who cares
[20512.54s -> 20531.72s]  I'm not gonna serve any food. Okay start at the very end of the hallway you make the bed
[20534.46s -> 20556.54s]  Already made get the laundry leave across the hall same exact thing turn around this bed's made, right?
[20556.70s -> 20566.94s]  It is leave down the hall. Nobody else has the the we want room service thing
[20570.31s -> 20573.35s]  Is it just everybody? It doesn't I thought I said only if they have the thing on their door
[20573.59s -> 20587.21s]  Does that just count that's all I don't have to do the whole thing again, okay
[20600.31s -> 20610.14s]  That's done
[20610.14s -> 20634.94s]  Now what now what I kind of don't know long as it's not time to cook. I might as well stay out of the kitchen
[20635.58s -> 20671.26s]  Can't do anything here. I'll go back outside. I will go to uh the needle. Can you confirm that corn pop was bad?
[20672.97s -> 20677.51s]  um corn pops
[20677.59s -> 20681.62s]  pops
[20681.62s -> 20689.98s]  How do I open this? I like I thought the corn pops like the god half my pops, right?
[20690.54s -> 20700.34s]  I need to open that door
[20700.34s -> 20719.91s]  Wrong wrong wrong. No more avalanches for me. Thank you very much. So where do I go?
[20723.38s -> 20733.53s]  No more avalanches for me. Thank you very much. There we go. Why don't we talk about a landfill?
[20738.17s -> 20739.77s]  Book in more rooms
[20739.77s -> 20754.34s]  It's a simple question. Um
[20755.14s -> 20760.58s]  I don't have a simple answer for you
[20760.58s -> 20765.30s]  The speed run for this game is 21 seconds. Is it actually that seems ridiculous?
[20765.86s -> 20775.34s]  Have I been to a landfill before? I cannot say that i've been to a landfill
[20775.82s -> 20780.54s]  Ah much better. That's really cool. I've been to a landfill
[20781.18s -> 20786.03s]  Look up the video of the speed run
[20786.03s -> 20798.73s]  No, no, I want to beat this. I don't want to see the 20 second speed run
[20804.16s -> 20852.35s]  Okay, what about what's going on in here? It's locked nothing in here. All right, what's this weapons?
[20852.67s -> 20927.92s]  I don't know. These are locked up completely locked up locked up. Really just open it. I can't how do I get in here?
[20928.08s -> 20942.14s]  I don't understand. You got a picture of a wolf in your room
[20942.22s -> 20977.55s]  What the hell was that? Is it dinnertime? No need to go in there till it's time to cook
[20978.57s -> 20995.88s]  No need to go in there till it's time to cook scary. Okay. Oh this thing. What's the deal with this?
[20996.12s -> 21004.99s]  What's the deal with this? I think I know the deal with this
[21005.39s -> 21022.84s]  Does it do I have to put the is it about the edges here? I don't get it because you see how these
[21026.99s -> 21033.10s]  I just yawned and I want to yawn in front of you like
[21033.50s -> 21037.00s]  Okay, do the all the raccoons have to be with that line on the left?
[21037.16s -> 21045.82s]  See i'm saying I think it's probably that and then
[21047.87s -> 21071.16s]  No, thanks for taking your disgusting bodily function off camera. That makes like sense to me though, right bottom line right line top line
[21071.24s -> 21075.50s]  But what about the mill you guys want to you know something interesting?
[21075.74s -> 21082.72s]  What interesting I started to do recently that I got I got really into i'm curious how much I care about it
[21084.38s -> 21107.68s]  Uh, I bought a bunch of clay. I'm just making a bunch of weird shit with it. That's all I thought at first
[21107.76s -> 21115.42s]  It was just match everything but maybe it's not this is a clue somehow
[21115.66s -> 21125.48s]  No, I have no idea what the solution of this is but I feel like I should know it at some point
[21125.48s -> 21162.99s]  You're suing right salmonella and the potato salad. I didn't do this. Did I I didn't do this
[21163.23s -> 21171.72s]  I'm gonna go trying to turn the lodge into some kind of ody-tody spa while she still can first the wolf now this i'm leaving
[21172.20s -> 21189.71s]  Okay. Oh, they're back. What's up? Do you ever see anyone else when you're out there snowshoeing?
[21189.95s -> 21191.95s]  I see that yanik guy sometimes
[21192.27s -> 21197.15s]  I'll be plodding along and he'll go zooming by those skis of his are like rockets, man
[21197.47s -> 21199.47s]  He's all like zippy zoom
[21199.55s -> 21205.23s]  Do you ever see the wolf never sometimes I hear it howl though bad news, man
[21205.95s -> 21208.35s]  It doesn't take a very big sound to trigger an avalanche
[21208.59s -> 21210.03s]  And when you're out there by yourself
[21210.03s -> 21215.63s]  Nothing will ruin your day faster than a couple of tons of snow roaring your way at 100 miles an hour
[21216.19s -> 21218.19s]  Tell me about it
[21220.01s -> 21224.41s]  What do you think about all the weird things that have been happening around here? I think they're kind of cool
[21224.97s -> 21226.97s]  Accidents make life colorful, you know
[21227.21s -> 21233.21s]  You wouldn't be saying that if you were the one who'd slipped on those ice-covered stairs or eaten that bad potato salad
[21233.37s -> 21238.89s]  Or had those four flat tires. Say that again. Hey, I had that broken window broken window
[21239.45s -> 21241.29s]  I went snowshoeing on like the third day
[21241.29s -> 21246.33s]  I was here and when I got back the window in my room was broken glass was all over the place
[21248.01s -> 21254.57s]  Why is he wearing vault dweller clothes who broke it don't know don't know what true get either
[21254.89s -> 21258.17s]  There was no rock on the floor. No bullet. No nothing
[21258.81s -> 21262.81s]  It was the wolf tried to jump up into your room, but didn't quite make it
[21263.29s -> 21268.97s]  That's bogus dude. My room's on the second floor and besides wolves don't do stuff like that
[21269.37s -> 21274.49s]  Hey, that wolf does a lot of stuff wolves aren't supposed to do. That's why it needs to be hunted down
[21274.65s -> 21278.25s]  Nobody even knows anything about this wolf man get off its case
[21279.20s -> 21282.00s]  Anyway, my window broke and nobody knows why
[21282.56s -> 21286.96s]  It's pretty awesome. Huh? So you like to snowshoe. I like doing stuff outside
[21287.52s -> 21289.52s]  Snowshoeing is about all I can afford
[21289.84s -> 21295.12s]  Think you could teach me sometime. You don't learn how to snowshoe if you need to get through snow
[21295.12s -> 21299.44s]  That's too deep to walk through you slap on some snowshoes and you just do it
[21300.40s -> 21302.80s]  Okay. Well, i'll let you go ditto, dude
[21303.68s -> 21310.65s]  Hey excellent job on the snowshoeing. Eh, we had ourselves one fine time out there because of you, especially lu here
[21310.97s -> 21312.97s]  I beat him five times
[21313.77s -> 21317.37s]  By the slimmest of margins. What's up, kiddo?
[21320.04s -> 21325.80s]  Are you by any chance related to ralph kessler the guy who used to build carousels around the turn of the last century?
[21326.28s -> 21328.54s]  No idea
[21328.54s -> 21331.42s]  Is this the first time you've been to the lodge? Yep sure is
[21332.65s -> 21335.37s]  Well, I better get back to work glad you dropped by
[21338.00s -> 21340.00s]  Then it's fucking backflip
[21348.22s -> 21350.94s]  All right, maybe if I talked because this guy was like, oh you didn't do your job
[21351.02s -> 21353.34s]  But now I did so now does he have anything else to say?
[21362.25s -> 21365.90s]  Where where is he by the way?
[21365.90s -> 21371.82s]  There you are. What you need the avalanche patrol asked me to tell you that the explosives training session in calgary has been postponed
[21371.82s -> 21378.86s]  Till next month. Well, hallelujah. I didn't really want to go anywhere until I finished off that wolf now. I won't have to
[21379.90s -> 21381.90s]  So you're on the avalanche patrol, huh?
[21382.38s -> 21383.42s]  Yep, dang
[21383.42s -> 21388.94s]  I just remembered patrol wants me to keep an eye on skookum ridge for the next couple of weeks. Okay, skookum ridge
[21389.34s -> 21391.34s]  There's the key to the snowmobile
[21392.22s -> 21394.14s]  And see if there's been an avalanche
[21394.14s -> 21396.14s]  You want me to check it out?
[21396.62s -> 21398.62s]  So you don't have to worry about the cold
[21398.62s -> 21401.42s]  Make sure you call the patrol and give them a report when you're done
[21401.90s -> 21406.30s]  You can handle that cold. It is a little chilly in here. Let me go ahead and get that fire started over there
[21406.78s -> 21413.37s]  Nice
[21416.27s -> 21417.79s]  So where we going now?
[21417.79s -> 21432.81s]  Okay, you bet. You bet good. I think that's enough. I'm sweaty
[21433.53s -> 21449.76s]  So now where's this snowmobile two more things that bill kessler guys getting bored. He's checking for plus
[21451.28s -> 21454.72s]  He wants competition, you know me too. Well, that's why the cam can't be on
[21456.00s -> 21458.00s]  Oh, I did something and
[21458.24s -> 21460.40s]  Other thing is a cold snips on its way
[21460.80s -> 21465.28s]  You think okay, they like it good. Just wait got to be real careful anytime you're outside
[21466.24s -> 21468.24s]  So we're done here
[21468.24s -> 21471.36s]  Okay, i'm gonna take this normal questions. I had by the way
[21471.76s -> 21475.92s]  You dumped the laundry bag before all the rooms were clean. No, I didn't this guy
[21478.08s -> 21480.72s]  I don't get it because i've done that like three times now
[21486.88s -> 21489.82s]  What's this guy's problem? All right snowmobile. Let's go
[21492.83s -> 21499.10s]  actual progress
[21499.10s -> 21508.64s]  Where is the snowmobile nancy drew?
[21512.06s -> 21516.09s]  How does she do that
[21519.68s -> 21522.32s]  She's talking to herself what are ice balls
[21525.13s -> 21531.34s]  I feel like she has her hand up right now going like this ali's daughter freddy
[21533.20s -> 21534.88s]  She's like talking
[21534.88s -> 21560.14s]  She's just kind of bored. What the hell fucking destroying this kid right in the face, too
[21562.09s -> 21567.64s]  If you're gonna have a snowball fight, you don't ever don't ever aim for the face. You know what I mean?
[21568.04s -> 21570.04s]  Especially like a little kid
[21570.36s -> 21572.76s]  You I'm not trying to pinpoint throw this
[21573.40s -> 21576.68s]  Snowball at a kid's face, you know you throw it like oh
[21577.48s -> 21583.64s]  You throw it like towards the ground over there and oh you miss that way and oh, oh, no, you got me
[21584.20s -> 21588.20s]  Who is throwing fucking baseball pitcher throws of?
[21588.98s -> 21594.57s]  Snowballs at a little kid's face. No, you know, you're just like, oh, yay
[21594.65s -> 21597.69s]  I we flip-flang and I lost who is who is doing that?
[21598.57s -> 21604.81s]  Nancy nancy slow down. Holy smokes. All right, there's a
[21607.31s -> 21610.25s]  Let me wind up
[21610.25s -> 21613.37s]  Just like if I don't get warm soon
[21614.09s -> 21616.09s]  I may not make it what?
[21622.52s -> 21640.40s]  A nice fishing shack a nice warm one at that. Did I walk here? I don't understand how this works
[21640.80s -> 21644.51s]  What kind of weird shit is that?
[21645.55s -> 21646.91s]  I'm sorry
[21646.91s -> 21648.91s]  I was trying. Wait, is it over?
[21652.09s -> 21658.84s]  No, we're good. How do you catch a fish?
[21678.73s -> 21701.63s]  Hello
[21701.63s -> 21712.99s]  Do I not have bait on the line? Is that the problem? I need a worm nice i'm measuring it with a ruler
[21729.04s -> 21733.53s]  16 inches
[21733.53s -> 21747.34s]  How big I think I have to get like a big one, right? That's a big one right there. That thing is huge
[21748.81s -> 21756.36s]  Am I am I i'm not holding on over what do I do? What's the point of this?
[21756.36s -> 21760.68s]  Oh my god, that's a huge fish got it a sturgeon chewed right through my line
[21770.49s -> 21781.61s]  What am I supposed to be doing though? Okay
[21781.93s -> 21783.13s]  Get the boot
[21783.13s -> 21808.75s]  I'm just imagining somebody tying a line to a big piece of driftwood like putting it in the water and then
[21809.23s -> 21813.71s]  Being insanely excited just pulling it up being like oh dude. Oh, what did I get?
[21814.43s -> 21818.59s]  Driftwood and like everyone that you're with is like cheering and they take pictures of you with it and stuff
[21823.12s -> 21829.07s]  Am I supposed to pick up the boot?
[21832.64s -> 21841.15s]  Well, that has a target on it. I didn't pick it up though. I think I have to get whatever that is
[21841.79s -> 21859.23s]  Just staying up here
[21859.31s -> 21888.06s]  That can had a target on it. Where is it? Come on. Come on. Where's the can?
[21888.30s -> 21906.46s]  It has to be a reason to be down here
[21906.94s -> 21909.18s]  I snagged a log there goes my line
[21909.82s -> 21921.45s]  No, I didn't just keep getting random fishes and stuff
[21925.13s -> 21927.69s]  Is this just a fun mini game to play does this mean anything?
[21932.32s -> 21937.44s]  Does somebody even know the bomb? I already got it. It blows up the shack
[21937.92s -> 21969.32s]  I want to see that can again. Maybe there's a certain type of fish I have to get the sturgeon was huge
[21969.64s -> 21995.13s]  I'm surprised that wasn't it. I mean, why are you asking us questions about your favorite game?
[21996.52s -> 22006.81s]  There we go. I got it. That was exactly two feet. Yeah, I couldn't pick it up
[22010.52s -> 22012.78s]  No, what why did it not let me do that?
[22014.04s -> 22026.64s]  You need the can you need the can you need the can you need the can I didn't need the can
[22029.24s -> 22035.68s]  I think I need a basket or something. Yeah, I need I need like a basket. I need something
[22037.44s -> 22046.00s]  I can't carry anything. I need to come back here later
[22046.16s -> 22060.52s]  I'm gonna have to come back here much later because that's the end of the stream. Here's what's gonna happen
[22062.96s -> 22066.92s]  I'll see you guys on sunday sunday. We're gonna finish this nancy drew game
[22069.28s -> 22075.32s]  I'm gonna see if the diablo servers are fine. We'll do this maybe a little bit diablo 4
[22076.84s -> 22085.68s]  But we will complete this on sunday. Thanks for watching. See you sunday
[22085.92s -> 22094.80s]  I said till the 31st, but I kind of want to play it these games are very they're just really I like them
[22095.04s -> 22101.37s]  They're nice crew crew lives. Yeah
[22103.60s -> 22110.30s]  Uh, oh keep an eye on the grotto beast twitter because i'm gonna take a picture with the glow in the dark on
[22111.93s -> 22117.21s]  I'm i'm i'm surprised it wasn't showing up. I want you to see that it actually does glow in the dark
[22117.37s -> 22130.16s]  So we'll take a picture i'll go and like pitch black rubbin will light it up keep an eye on the grotto beast twitter and
[22130.64s -> 22160.32s]  What else I don't want to tell you what time sunday finding a time. I'm just i'm searching for six o'clock pacific
[22168.17s -> 22173.29s]  Uh resny before yeah, that comes out on the 22nd 23rd. I'll be playing it on launch
[22174.12s -> 22179.08s]  I don't know exactly when it comes out. But whenever I stream on that day, we'll play resny before
[22179.40s -> 22182.00s]  We'll probably be playing that for a couple days in a row
[22182.00s -> 22185.28s]  I imagine at least because I want to just beat it and play it because the game's awesome
[22187.00s -> 22199.32s]  I need to save this. There we go. All right, it is saved it is ready and that's it. Thank you for watching
[22201.44s -> 22203.44s]  D4 was pretty fun. It was i'm
[22203.92s -> 22206.48s]  Looking forward to playing a little bit more to give you a real assessment of it
[22224.83s -> 22231.31s]  Uh, jimmy neutron game is required reading well as we settle here after stream rewards
[22231.31s -> 22236.19s]  Obviously after grotto beast is out in the wild and people have it and we can um
[22236.43s -> 22239.40s]  Because that's been something i've been paying attention to a lot recently
[22240.35s -> 22244.75s]  So once we get that done i'll be able to play a lot more random stuff
[22244.99s -> 22249.98s]  My grotto be shirt is coming this weekend i'm hyped
[22250.38s -> 22253.66s]  Yeah, the apparel should do I think the apparel is going out to people
[22254.67s -> 22260.35s]  So people I think from my understanding I think that that's shipping before that's going to ship before all the uh cards and stuff
[22260.35s -> 22270.64s]  So you should get that first or at least maybe if you ordered individually apparel. Yeah
[22271.12s -> 22273.44s]  Most of this stuff is at least the first batch
[22275.39s -> 22290.67s]  Is um, it's coming soon. It should be shipping at some point in the next couple weeks. Thanks again
[22292.08s -> 22293.52s]  We'll take a picture
[22293.52s -> 22298.46s]  We'll go do it right now to show that the thing actually glows in the dark so there's no
[22299.26s -> 22304.48s]  Um, what did somebody say earlier the tesla truck incident?
[22306.88s -> 22318.43s]  I whatever it's midnight. I'm allowed to like snort like a fucking weirdo. It's fine. Nobody's even here right now
[22318.83s -> 22322.83s]  It's nobody's even here watching. It's just me in the room. It's me in the monitor
[22322.83s -> 22329.77s]  That's the only people that heard that only weirdos snort. No, I
