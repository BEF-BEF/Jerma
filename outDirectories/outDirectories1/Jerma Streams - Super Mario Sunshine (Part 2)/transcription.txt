[0.89s -> 12.70s]  Hello there. How you doing? Good morning to you. Oh, good morning. Good, um, good afternoon.
[13.88s -> 18.60s]  Whatever time it is where you are. How are you? Hope you're doing a fantastic day.
[20.86s -> 24.87s]  It's midnight. Good morning. Yeah, I don't know why I said good morning.
[28.30s -> 38.09s]  Good morning. Oh yeah, but it's like, it's like time zones exist. It's morning somewhere in the world.
[38.89s -> 44.33s]  Always. It doesn't matter. It could be, it could be 10 o'clock at night
[45.30s -> 54.49s]  for you and potentially one o'clock in the morning for me. It's 10 30 a.m. in Australia.
[54.49s -> 66.01s]  That's who I was talking to. It was good indeed. 16 hours ago. But welcome back. We're doing more
[66.01s -> 74.76s]  Mario Sunshine shoe eating stream. That's yeah. Well, I'm glad you made it. I, how did you know?
[74.76s -> 78.68s]  I've got like four different shoes here on plates and shit. This is, that's kind of weird. How would
[78.68s -> 97.82s]  you know that? I was gonna eat them all. Damn. One day, here's a list of ideas that I say that
[97.82s -> 101.82s]  I'll never do, but I would like to because I'm just right now, which is I'm just spit balling
[101.82s -> 111.50s]  this to you. What have I had like six or seven shoes custom made out of edible licorice or
[111.50s -> 116.78s]  something and they looked very real. I paid like a lot of money to have these shoes look really
[116.78s -> 131.08s]  fucking real. And I ate them on stream and pretended they were Willy Wonka like lose a bet
[131.08s -> 136.44s]  at some point in the stream. Now this is, this is exclusive to you guys because if I ever not,
[136.44s -> 142.02s]  I'm never going to do this. If I ever do this, you guys will know. But an hour goes by in the stream
[142.02s -> 146.02s]  and I make a bet with you guys and I'm like, oh, you know, fine, whatever. If I lose this bet,
[146.02s -> 150.34s]  I'll eat fucking 10 shoes. And everyone would be like, what the fuck? And I lose it. And then
[150.34s -> 163.37s]  here we go. The camera goes on. You're supposed to eat shoes on March 12th. You can't put that
[163.37s -> 175.37s]  there right now. That's not even real. Why is it to be 10? I don't know. Why not? Welcome back. I
[175.37s -> 192.74s]  have 26 shines in Mario sunshine. I'm having a lot of fun. Game's great. Evidence. Hold on. What?
[192.74s -> 199.61s]  I said, I wait, I said I was going to do this already. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[199.93s -> 218.52s]  hold on. Did I actually say this like four months ago? Wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
[223.54s -> 231.10s]  This is like back, this is like a year ago. I said I was going to eat a full shoe on stream. If
[231.10s -> 245.00s]  sans was confirmed and shoot, uh, he was last yesterday. Oh no. Why did I think this is,
[245.00s -> 248.18s]  why did I know this was going to happen? I mean, smash.
[250.76s -> 261.27s]  Well, I, what do I say? I said right here, March 12th. And so the shoe eating stream will be
[261.99s -> 271.96s]  on, uh, March 12th, 2020 market on your calendar. You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.
[271.96s -> 285.78s]  Yep. All right. Mark it on your calendar. Uh, Freddy dread gave 50 subs. Holy fuck, dude.
[286.42s -> 294.86s]  Thanks for the 50 subs. Freddy dread coming in. Yeah. All right. Well, fuck it. You know what
[294.86s -> 300.87s]  I'm doing. Never lied about eating the shoe. No, did I? Uh, last time I looked at my calendar,
[300.87s -> 305.27s]  it was not March 12th. It was March. I don't even know what days don't there's no such thing
[305.27s -> 309.59s]  as a day anymore in my brain. Only like weeks. All right. So it's March 5th.
[310.63s -> 321.05s]  I got plenty of fucking time to get a full shoe on stream. We had a wink. We actually did.
[326.74s -> 333.13s]  Welcome back to Mario Sunshine. I'll give you a look. Those of you that have not been around
[333.13s -> 337.93s]  the last, uh, it's gonna say few days, but it was actually less than 24 hours ago.
[339.27s -> 349.51s]  40 blue coins, 26 shines and zero regular coins. Uh, where do I want to go? I'm just,
[349.83s -> 357.56s]  I'm obsessed with collecting, but Freddy dread, that was an absolute shitload of subs.
[359.10s -> 365.21s]  Thank you for the ridiculous amount of subs. You did it again. You did it a second time,
[366.42s -> 378.90s]  like two, a minute ago. Oh my fucking God, Freddy, a hundred community subs from Freddy dread.
[381.88s -> 394.18s]  Jesus. Thanks, dude. That's a lot. You're supposed to do, you're supposed to do pachinko. Yeah. I
[394.18s -> 408.22s]  said I would, I said I would do it today, but I didn't say when. Did I? Yeah, I did. And then
[408.22s -> 416.28s]  Austin Atlantis gave five community subs as well. Thank you, Austin Atlantis. I'm doing it. I'm
[416.28s -> 427.83s]  going. I wish Nintendo would stop making bankable games and just make pachinko machines. Well, you
[427.83s -> 435.53s]  say that, but over the next 10 to 15 years, uh, all of those, all those Betty white machines
[437.13s -> 444.09s]  and all those, like, look at the cute kitty cat slot machines are going to get replaced by Mario
[444.09s -> 456.01s]  Sonic and like solid snake and shit. Time stamp this, mark my words. Like the Elvis machines,
[456.57s -> 462.62s]  gone. All of them. The Alfred Hitchcock slot machine, all of them gone, replaced with
[462.62s -> 480.84s]  Super Mario slot machines. Garin fucking T. How am I feeling? I'm feeling all right.
[480.84s -> 494.90s]  I'm feeling all right today. No, I'm sorry. I'll get it when it comes back. He's lying.
[495.54s -> 500.65s]  Now, if you missed it yesterday for some, I don't know. I have like fucking mystery pain
[500.65s -> 507.05s]  around my whole body. Right. And we already talked about it, but like, yeah, I got my like tongue
[507.05s -> 510.41s]  started hurting yesterday. It was just weird. And it like kind of freaked me out for like 10 minutes.
[511.29s -> 519.13s]  But oh my God, I missed it again. I guess this is the equivalent. If I, uh, if I was sitting there
[519.13s -> 525.22s]  waiting for a bus in real life and I'm on the phone, like talking to my mom or something and
[525.22s -> 534.46s]  the bus pulls up twice and I don't get on it. I got to get on the fucking bus. I got to get home.
[534.46s -> 545.43s]  I got to go home. Freddy dread. Holy shit. 200 bucks, 20,000 bits from Freddy dread,
[546.15s -> 553.93s]  a hundred community subs and $200 in bits. This is one of my favorite games. Thank you,
[553.93s -> 561.02s]  German. My man. This game's awesome. I've never played it. This is fucking crazy, man. Thank you.
[561.58s -> 573.58s]  I go. I got to get on the bus. I have to get on the bus running behind the bus.
[573.58s -> 577.42s]  No, stop, please. Please. No, no, no, no. I'll get on. I'll get on. No,
[578.46s -> 586.97s]  we're going to wait again. I have to memory a fucking four year old. Just get on the boat. Now
[588.66s -> 595.62s]  Nocturne, Nocturne, I have to turn a hundred bucks each shoe. Wait, I got to get on the bus.
[595.62s -> 607.03s]  Just wait a minute. Okay. Uh, Nocturne gave us a hundred dollars. Remember I told you how red it
[607.03s -> 614.89s]  was yesterday. Read it and it's a ton of more money now. Like right now is hundreds and hundreds
[614.89s -> 623.13s]  and hundreds of dollars each shoe, March 12th. I don't, and Hey, don't fucking, I'm going to,
[623.13s -> 628.14s]  I got to trust you guys not to talk shit about this. Cause if I get a custom made edible shoe
[628.70s -> 638.26s]  for March 12th, you bet your ass that you better not be telling anybody about that.
[638.26s -> 646.01s]  You got to be in on the joke. All right. How many do I need? Eight. But thank you both of you.
[646.01s -> 665.43s]  Seriously. Leather is edible. If you think for even one, one second that I am going to eat
[665.43s -> 679.40s]  a real shoe on stream and like die. You're crazy. Oh, this sucks. All right. I know how to do it.
[679.40s -> 691.85s]  I know how to do this. The ultimate joke. You got to get in like right here. All right. Now right
[691.85s -> 713.58s]  there. Okay. Nice. What the fuck was that? I got it. Okay. These are the worst ones. I got to make
[713.58s -> 720.63s]  sure the final one is one of the really easy ones up top. I need to see where am I going? All right.
[720.63s -> 727.91s]  There's one. I got to get the ones up. I want to get the ones up top last. The star definitely
[727.91s -> 741.85s]  goes in the middle. I am certain of that. Okay. There's only two more. I thought I just fell off
[741.85s -> 745.86s]  the edge and I was about to, I was about to be very, okay. There's the one all the way in the
[745.86s -> 753.14s]  end there. I got to go for that one next. And then there's the last one is the one all the way to the
[753.14s -> 769.34s]  right. I got to get that one. All right. Make it easy. Let's go. This is the camera. Just
[769.34s -> 776.33s]  fucking camera was just like a straight into the machine. I couldn't even see.
[776.33s -> 806.20s]  So have we determined, is it impossible for me to do this? Get in the corner right there.
[806.20s -> 841.37s]  Mario's kind of quirky. Yeah, he is very quirky. What are you doing? Get in there, get in there.
[841.37s -> 860.30s]  Come on, push it. Ah, this is going to get Jeremy floored. Wait, what? Why is that happening? All
[860.30s -> 865.24s]  right. No, no, no, no, no. Why, why is that happening? What the hell is that? I, why can I
[865.24s -> 875.72s]  fly with it? Why is it pushing me? He's got the fucking thing. All right. Hold on. See, it's like
[875.72s -> 886.94s]  shoving me to the right. I'm not pressing. It's just like, it's tossing me over there. Dude, what
[886.94s -> 903.45s]  the fuck? Dude, dude. See, what the fuck was that? I have to jump to this one. I have to jump to
[903.45s -> 921.18s]  that one. I have to. It's got, I have to do it like this because it doesn't, even if you,
[921.18s -> 927.83s]  this is really weird. Even if you jump over it, the game just decides it's just, it's going to
[927.83s -> 934.98s]  throw you like I'm not pressing. I'm in trouble. Holy fuck. That was close. Let go of the nozzle.
[945.08s -> 949.99s]  Oh, God damn it. Get in there, please. Don't you fucking even think about it,
[955.13s -> 963.45s]  but get in there, man. What the fuck? Somebody gave so many subs. Somebody had so many.
[964.49s -> 975.66s]  That's a hundred subs. I'm almost out of fucking water too. Hold on. Who just gave a hundred subs?
[977.13s -> 982.54s]  Austin Atlantis gave a hundred community subs. I took it. That's like a trillion dollars.
[985.80s -> 992.50s]  Holy shit, dude. Thanks for the hundred subs added to those. You got one. Nice.
[993.54s -> 1015.08s]  I'm almost out of water. I'm so paranoid. Oh, that's it. All right. New strategy is go for
[1015.08s -> 1018.68s]  the one on the left first. Cause that one's the, that one's just the hardest one to get.
[1018.68s -> 1037.85s]  Start crying right now. Cry now. There's more subs. I got it. I got it. Okay. I got it.
[1039.38s -> 1051.26s]  Another 25 from Freddie Dredd. Holy shit. You guys are going fucking crazy. I got the whole
[1051.26s -> 1073.22s]  left side. I got the wrong thing selected. How does that happen? What? Huh? Did I just go through
[1073.22s -> 1086.52s]  the wall? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What? I thought you
[1086.52s -> 1091.88s]  couldn't do that. There is no wall. I thought there was a, wait, there's not a back wall.
[1092.84s -> 1097.24s]  What the fuck? I'm trying. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a
[1097.24s -> 1102.36s]  minute. There's a, there's a glass back wall. Isn't there like an invisible wall? How do you
[1102.36s -> 1117.34s]  not fly out? I, I can't believe I got the hard one too. What? There is in some places. What the
[1117.34s -> 1132.65s]  fuck? Don't miss the bus. What the hell is that? I thought, I thought I was going to just slide
[1132.65s -> 1145.34s]  down like I always do out the back. You mean you tell me I can fall out that way? I hit also. All
[1145.34s -> 1150.06s]  right. Hold on. It's all like, okay, I'm missing the bus. Yes. I, but I'm taking my eyes off the
[1150.06s -> 1155.02s]  screen. But you have to remember I'm not, I'm waiting at the bus stop and somebody's driving
[1155.02s -> 1161.16s]  by the bus stop every few minutes throwing $500 off the window. And I'm like, wow, do I get on the
[1161.16s -> 1166.84s]  bus? I got to try. Get on the bus. Hold on. Let me, I gotta get that money. Hold on. Fuck the bus.
[1167.64s -> 1171.88s]  Then like 10 more minutes go by. Like another person just like, Hey, hey buddy.
[1172.60s -> 1177.14s]  It like throws like $200 off the window. I'm just like, holy shit. That's fine. I gotta get that
[1177.14s -> 1199.80s]  money. I got people driving behind the bus. Just tossing fucking checks out of it. All right. I'm
[1199.80s -> 1203.48s]  getting on. I'm getting on. I'm getting, I can't believe I can fall in the back. Hold on. Wait a
[1203.48s -> 1209.72s]  minute. I'm so tilted from what just happened. I'm so fucking mad from being falling out the back
[1209.72s -> 1214.04s]  fucking window. I can't believe this is even possible. You can't fall out the front. Why can
[1214.12s -> 1233.54s]  you fall out the back? Let me on the bus. Oh my goodness. Why did I say I would do this level?
[1233.54s -> 1238.74s]  This is like the joke meme level that nobody does. They spend five minutes on this level. They go,
[1238.74s -> 1258.39s]  nah, I'm just going to play the fucking actual video game. I don't care who did it.
[1260.68s -> 1267.19s]  Guess what? LeBron James can dunk. I don't go, you know, I'm going to dunk first try too. Let
[1267.19s -> 1299.62s]  me get that. Give me that ball LeBron. And I go, I go to dunk on LeBron and he fucking does like
[1299.62s -> 1307.98s]  the most embarrassing, just like smash the ball out of my hand. And he, it does, it's so hard.
[1307.98s -> 1312.30s]  It does so hard that it's like, boom, boom, hits me like right in the nose. And I'm like,
[1312.30s -> 1315.82s]  oh, my nose like blows up with blood and shit. And I have to go to like the hospital.
[1316.79s -> 1350.36s]  I don't care. Wait, you met LeBron. You're getting dunked on. This is fucking so stupid.
[1365.24s -> 1372.74s]  Stop grabbing the wall. Let go of the wall. Why? What are you doing?
[1384.87s -> 1398.18s]  Okay. I figured it out. I don't do, although that was, you can fall off the fucking edge.
[1398.18s -> 1435.40s]  Don't do that. Okay. That kind of doesn't work. This is so fucking ridiculous.
[1442.07s -> 1472.78s]  It's going to work if I get it. No matter if the game is horse shit, I still made it work.
[1472.78s -> 1485.21s]  Just throws you to the right no matter what. All right. I got to get the ones on the right.
[1485.21s -> 1527.99s]  Okay. I got it. Don't fuck it up. One more. I'm preparing. Here we go.
[1541.42s -> 1548.25s]  It's not over yet. It's not over yet. It's not over yet. It's not over yet. I have to get in there.
[1548.25s -> 1591.61s]  Do it again. Do it again. Just relax. Do it again. Do it again. I don't want to, I'm holding the
[1591.61s -> 1596.79s]  ball right now. I got LeBron's in front of me and he's laughing. He's like, oh, you're going to try
[1596.79s -> 1606.09s]  it again. Yeah. In a minute. All right. Whenever you're ready, man. Whenever you're ready to go.
[1606.71s -> 1626.87s]  Wait a second. I'm just trying to figure out which way to go. No. Hey, I mean, I got like a
[1626.87s -> 1633.69s]  bunch of meetings to go to, but can you try to slam dunk already? Just shut up. I'm going. I'm
[1633.69s -> 1649.61s]  going to go when I'm ready. You know, you know who I am, right? I know who you are. All right.
[1650.41s -> 1701.18s]  Here I go. You can't slam dunk, Don. I did it. Phew. I'm glad I don't have to do that again.
[1701.34s -> 1721.13s]  He's just a guy that slam dunked LeBron. Yeah, I did. I did. I miss winked. Oh shit. I did.
[1726.10s -> 1736.73s]  And a ton of money. All right. Let me get hurt. Oh shit. I did it. I just did it again for fun.
[1740.62s -> 1756.09s]  Another one. Wait, what did it say? All right. Now I can, it's been 30 minutes. Can I actually
[1756.09s -> 1766.63s]  play the fucking game now? 10 more. Oh my, wow. How much, how much money came in? That's a lot.
[1766.63s -> 1770.71s]  Oh, we had, we had the hundred subs. We had 25 from Freddie. We had five from Labster,
[1770.71s -> 1776.87s]  10 from Javelin, a hundred dollars from Core Monster. Congrats on not beefing. 10 more from
[1776.87s -> 1796.58s]  Atlantis. You guys are fucking crazy. Thanks. That's a lot of money guys. Thank you. I want
[1796.58s -> 1812.10s]  to go over here. Did I get all eight here? No. Oh, I know. I got them all. I did get them all.
[1812.66s -> 1817.26s]  I did get them all at Gelato Beach. I remember this one. All right. Well, you can't back out
[1817.26s -> 1831.02s]  for some reason. Why can't you know back out of this menu? Press Z to see the levels you read.
[1831.02s -> 1840.17s]  Oh, imagine if your memory card got corrupt. Oh, there's a hundred coins. I don't, I'm not,
[1840.17s -> 1850.34s]  I don't need to do that. All right. I got five. We don't have the lowest. Eight at Gelato Beach.
[1851.67s -> 1861.18s]  Five. I think I have, oh, the park. I only have one at, in a park. All right. We're going to the park.
[1861.18s -> 1862.46s]  I got to go in the cannon though, right?
[1878.25s -> 1896.66s]  I don't know why they didn't add that. That should be the noise he's making.
[1898.82s -> 1920.87s]  Here we go. The beach cannons secret. It was a middle school joke. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
[1921.59s -> 1928.55s]  Shut up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Shut up. I'm just kidding. Shut up. I'm just kidding. All right.
[1928.55s -> 1951.10s]  What are we going? Let's get him. Pepehans. He hates me. No, I don't. How long you've been,
[1951.10s -> 1958.57s]  how long you've been watching this channel? Don't, I've already told you guys that 98%
[1958.57s -> 1974.54s]  of everything you hear on this channel is fabricated. Okay. Pick it up. Stop running
[1974.54s -> 2007.96s]  your fucking head into it, man. Pick up the bomb. That's, this game is really fun. NA aim.
[2008.76s -> 2020.12s]  Let's go. So what's in here? Wait, is this another one of those levels?
[2023.58s -> 2055.30s]  It's one of these. I do appreciate the, uh, wall paper. Okay. There we go.
[2071.03s -> 2074.87s]  I just blanked. I just like blacked out for a second. I don't know why that was. I just blacked
[2074.87s -> 2090.62s]  out. I forgot. I'm blacking out. All right. Here we go. I'm good. All right. I'm fine. This is not
[2090.62s -> 2130.68s]  that bad. Oh, kids. Where am I? What happened? Wait. Oh, I'm fine. All right. What's going on
[2130.68s -> 2135.05s]  with that fucking control scheme? All right. What the fuck's going on with this fucking control
[2135.05s -> 2157.00s]  scheme? Am I getting pushed with air? Why does this feel so strange? What's this air pushing me?
[2157.00s -> 2164.12s]  I'm being pushed in weird directions. All right. Right. When that thing go now,
[2164.76s -> 2176.74s]  I got to settle the fuck down. It's fucking air pushing me.
[2182.49s -> 2197.61s]  There's air. There's air pushing me. All right. What the fuck is going on? Why is this so strange?
[2198.17s -> 2219.13s]  There's air like moving me like left and right. All right. Break the crates is your emulator.
[2219.93s -> 2226.46s]  No, this isn't the original. You know, why would you go up there?
[2229.72s -> 2244.47s]  There's copy protection on the disk. That's weird. All right. Here we go. I'm going to count
[2245.64s -> 2253.10s]  right when the last one falls. Maybe one, two. Okay. It's two false seconds.
[2253.66s -> 2300.41s]  Here we go. And one, two, one, two. Okay. Two. Holy fuck. Holy fuck. Hey, this one's for free.
[2301.05s -> 2323.34s]  I stopped doing the TikTok thing. I don't know why I'm doing that. Turn up the game volume.
[2323.90s -> 2349.48s]  Nah. Yeah, sure. How's that? Better? Apologize. This is my red coins of the pirate ships.
[2350.52s -> 2366.20s]  Cool. Nobody has a name called tag me when Derma's upset. That's just. See, now you're just
[2366.20s -> 2382.50s]  gaming the system. Now, you know, you're just getting all these tags. The chat is devolving.
[2384.14s -> 2390.36s]  It's all right. It's all right. All right. We got to get up there. Do I ride the teacups?
[2397.19s -> 2409.11s]  That's kind of fun. Red coin. All right. Get on the pirate ship. Oh, okay. So any more red coins on
[2409.11s -> 2425.88s]  these ships? Okay. Uh, across. Oops. I hit my head. Whatever. Blue coin. I'll get it in a minute.
[2433.99s -> 2441.99s]  Nintendo is watching. Oh, well, that's good. Uh, Nintendo, when are you going to put this game
[2441.99s -> 2448.47s]  somewhere else besides a GameCube disc? It's probably one of the top three Mario games you've
[2448.47s -> 2467.48s]  made. They all they left out. Oh, well. Oh shit. I didn't. That was like, no, we, you port, no
[2467.48s -> 2482.41s]  switch port, no e-shop. Where's the GameCube e-shop? Shit. That's another question. Well,
[2482.41s -> 2496.18s]  that was still got it. And now from here, I'm going to go. Oh my God. I mean this way.
[2497.99s -> 2515.06s]  And I missed it. And I fucking missed it. How? Oh, it's, it's just exhausting.
[2516.74s -> 2524.17s]  Hold on. My hands are sweating. Do you know who would make a trillion dollars if you made a
[2524.17s -> 2529.53s]  controller? Is there like any anti-sweat controllers? All right. I mean, first,
[2529.53s -> 2536.78s]  let me stop speaking so I can play a video game. Why do these things have to be made of this hard
[2536.78s -> 2542.66s]  sweat plastic? Why can't this be made of a cloth or something? Like I want a cloth that I can change
[2542.66s -> 2546.50s]  out. Like you do your laundry, you do, I give a fucking pillowcase. Why can I, why's there no
[2546.50s -> 2560.84s]  control of pillowcase? I'm doing this so wrong. Just go across. What? I don't need, I don't need
[2560.84s -> 2592.87s]  the boats anymore. Wait, can I get in here? That's a 5,000 IQ coin. Oh, I'll get another one.
[2593.51s -> 2609.40s]  You need gamer gloves. No, but that's, that makes it worse. All right. We got a good view.
[2609.40s -> 2626.52s]  What the fuck are you doing? Get out of my way. Blue shell fucker. I hate you. Oh, fucking Nintendo
[2626.52s -> 2640.57s]  Wii, Mario Kart. It's coming for me. All right. I gotta get up there. I think I do have to go on
[2640.57s -> 2656.34s]  the, that I have to get on these and then just not miss. Can I do it from here? Hmm, maybe. Can I
[2656.34s -> 2678.42s]  walk? Hold on. I think I just do it from here. As long as I'm not stupid about this. Oh, why is
[2678.42s -> 2717.80s]  this game running at 12? Dude, your PC sucks. I'm not on the sheet. This guy move. This guy don't
[2717.80s -> 2730.65s]  move, does he? Well, shit. I have to like hover over there. Okay. We'll go back up.
[2741.35s -> 2753.16s]  Can I just shock him and then ground pound him? This camera is going to make me
[2753.16s -> 2777.85s]  throw up. Okay. Now I can get those. Or can I? I need water or else I'm not going to be able to
[2777.85s -> 2801.99s]  get up here. This is going to be bad. Okay. I think I can grab these without needing to fill water.
[2801.99s -> 2839.86s]  Let's see. Come on. Grab it. Okay. Do it again. Where are the other five coins though? All the
[2839.86s -> 2846.90s]  way up. This, this, this level might be the worst place for the camera. It's just in a building
[2846.90s -> 2869.26s]  every five seconds. God damn it. I can't see anything. Just, I want to get in the, I want to
[2869.26s -> 2903.56s]  get in the fairy go round, whatever this thing is called. Holy shit, Nintendo. I'm terribly sorry,
[2903.56s -> 2921.75s]  but this ride is currently under maintenance. Wow. Nintendo. Wow. Whatever. I don't even need to
[2921.75s -> 2949.66s]  say it. I need to get over there. I think I can just get there. Can I put you out? I got to get
[2949.66s -> 2963.99s]  rid of you. I'm trying to hold the thing down. It didn't hold it down hard enough. So I move.
[2965.03s -> 2998.65s]  It's frustrations settling in. Mad at children's games. Somebody told me I was going to get really
[2998.65s -> 3003.40s]  mad here. They were like, I can't wait until you get to level seven. Sucks. And I was like,
[3003.40s -> 3055.19s]  what is he talking about? This is Super Mario Sunshine. Grab it. I can't even be more like
[3055.19s -> 3074.33s]  your brother. He's not here right now. He's at school. All right. How do I, there's two more
[3074.33s -> 3084.44s]  coins. Where the fuck are they? Where's my, I can't spend my blue coins to get a red coin scanner
[3088.07s -> 3097.08s]  all the way up. Do I have to, I got to go over there. All right. I'm going for it. I'm going to
[3097.08s -> 3124.33s]  be smart about this though. Or are we? We'll find out. Can I punch them from below? If I, okay,
[3124.33s -> 3130.68s]  if I electrocute them and push them, can I, will they, do I get electrocuted by them if they,
[3130.68s -> 3145.67s]  if they're over me? Well, he's going to shock me, right? I thought they shocked you. All right. Now
[3145.67s -> 3163.70s]  I got to get on that thing. Pack them from below. I don't want to talk to them. They're electrified.
[3164.34s -> 3186.20s]  I didn't like that. What are your thoughts on Mario Kart 9? Um, I don't, which one is that?
[3186.20s -> 3192.81s]  There's been so many of them. All I know is Mario Kart 64, Mario Kart Wii, and then all of them
[3192.81s -> 3200.63s]  are the same game in my brain. The ninth one. Yeah, but which one is that? How many have there been?
[3201.35s -> 3215.00s]  How many Mario Karts are there? Is eight? Nine? Double dash? Yep. I know, but how many are there?
[3215.00s -> 3225.27s]  Is eight deluxe? Is 14? No, no, no, no, no, no. Mario, Mario Kart. How many Mario Karts are there?
[3227.38s -> 3233.67s]  Mario Kart 8 deluxe for the Nintendo Switch. Yeah, it is eight. I wasn't even looking at the
[3233.67s -> 3248.26s]  fucking screen again. God damn it. I'm like looking up shit on Google. How do I move this?
[3249.14s -> 3265.11s]  Can I like push this? Pull it? Can I grab this? Stomp it? Open that. Hey, I think you're in need
[3265.11s -> 3269.83s]  of a pair of my special sun shades. Oh, well then again, maybe you're not ready. You need to spend
[3269.83s -> 3274.82s]  a bit more time here. How much more time do I need to spend here? I've been here for like,
[3274.82s -> 3285.78s]  I've been here for like four days. How about you? I brought this baby to view the sunflowers,
[3285.78s -> 3297.30s]  but this looks unsafe. I didn't think Yoshis were bad creatures, that's for sure.
[3313.91s -> 3322.12s]  Wait, this is, there are actually Yoshis here? That's not a Yoshi.
[3322.92s -> 3343.19s]  That's like hermit crab. Whoa. Oh, they're draining the fertilizer from the ground.
[3343.19s -> 3366.17s]  They're drinking all the fertilizer in the water. Hey, wake up. All right, bring another one up. Back
[3366.17s -> 3382.38s]  to life. Plant, plant, plant, plant, plant. Here we go. Point, point, point. What? Fucking
[3382.38s -> 3401.21s]  speech is fucking. I hate that. Fucking speech is fucking. Nope. Don't think so. Why are you
[3401.21s -> 3407.38s]  doing this? Is one life worth more than another? I don't make the rules in Super Mario.
[3408.34s -> 3454.97s]  Nobody's dying. Don't you guys know? They're going away. They're all on vacation. Over here.
[3454.97s -> 3472.31s]  What? What happened there? Oh, you didn't spin around. All right, do it. Hey, why are you not
[3473.11s -> 3479.22s]  over here? Aha. You can't do anything about the sand. Can you? Oh, I got to be quicker than that,
[3479.22s -> 3510.46s]  huh? It's bringing you back to life. Yes. That was not even that bad. I see people on speed runs
[3510.46s -> 3524.87s]  do that. I can't do it. They do it like backwards into the thing, you know. Beat Dark Souls 3 on
[3524.87s -> 3529.19s]  stream, but you can't beat a single Mario game. I'm gonna beat, I'm beating this right now. Look,
[3529.19s -> 3547.11s]  don't you see on your screen? All right, let's move. Hurry, Mario. I can't imagine what the
[3547.11s -> 3572.66s]  poor princess is going through. Mario, please save her. Hey, Moni. Hey, you. Give me that Yoshi egg.
[3580.33s -> 3587.18s]  What the fuck? He was in my way. He was in my way. Wait, Moni's dead. Go on.
[3592.34s -> 3620.34s]  This is what was supposed to happen. Give me that fucking egg. Oh, he missed it. Good. You're just
[3620.34s -> 3633.74s]  as stupid as me. You really are a Mario clone. He's trying to hit the same jump, but can't hit it.
[3635.80s -> 3650.36s]  He's like, oh, whatever. He's just about to ride that Yoshi too. He needs bananas. I don't want
[3650.36s -> 3681.58s]  to get those. Stay right here, Yoshi. I got this. Here's your food. Ooh. You want some water?
[3686.31s -> 3696.92s]  You befriended Yoshi. Make him eat with B. Holy shit. I didn't even know Yoshi was in this game.
[3712.34s -> 3735.43s]  Yoshi's... Wait, I'm orange? Okay, so you can... What am I going to be? Juice.
[3737.80s -> 3756.94s]  Look at how long his tongue is in this game. All right, I get another one, right?
[3760.44s -> 3763.30s]  There's an egg over here. Okay, there it is.
[3767.27s -> 3771.11s]  No, that's such an old joke at this point, but it's still funny.
[3772.15s -> 3776.07s]  All right, let's go get some food. And that's... Ah, this is cool.
[3777.03s -> 3788.34s]  Whoa. Juice. What does the juice do? It's just like water. All right, let's eat a bunch of food.
[3788.98s -> 3803.35s]  All right, let's be orange. Now, where do I want to go? Anywhere, huh? Let's go back. Let's go this
[3803.35s -> 3836.73s]  way. But Yoshi can't come in here? Red coins on the water. Why can Yoshi not go in there?
[3837.37s -> 3850.76s]  Three minutes and paying attention to cutscenes. He's no dogs allowed. Yoshi's not a dog. He's a
[3850.76s -> 3861.82s]  lizard. Hey, Kazzy, thanks for the five minute resubs, Kazzy. Appreciate it. All right, so we
[3861.82s -> 3875.02s]  have to do... We have to go this way. Lizard. He's a lizard. He's a lizard. He's a lizard. Is it better?
[3880.26s -> 3893.34s]  This level. Pepe left. Do I have to do the race thing again over there? Is that what this is?
[3894.14s -> 3912.68s]  Did you do pachinko yet? Yes, I did. What's this? Collect eight coins before the timer runs out.
[3920.04s -> 3922.12s]  Well, okay. I'm pretty good at this.
[3944.42s -> 3957.96s]  Stop the car. Stop the car. Jesus, man. What are you doing? You don't go around a rotary
[3957.96s -> 4000.26s]  ten fucking times. What's wrong with you? Oh, God. It's baby Mario or baby Bowser. Wait,
[4000.26s -> 4009.93s]  there's a shine in... Wait, what? I can't believe there's a shine over there. Come here. Give me that.
[4010.57s -> 4028.02s]  Right, so I was just about to turbo... Yeah, shoot. Turbo nozzle. All right, how do I do this?
[4028.02s -> 4033.38s]  Turbo nozzle. This is a Yoshi up here. All right, there was a thing. There was a shine.
[4038.97s -> 4042.33s]  Where was it? Through these doors? There was some door I could go through. Which one?
[4043.90s -> 4058.14s]  Run just ran through doors. Is this thing fun? Holy fuck, this is kind of cool. Holy shit,
[4058.14s -> 4082.81s]  this is fucking awesome. I'm so pissed off. Another one. What the hell are we doing over here?
[4082.89s -> 4092.04s]  Wait, where is he? Where is that? Give me that turbo nozzle.
[4094.87s -> 4120.47s]  He's up. Where is he? He's like over here. Up there. Which side? This side? No, don't make me do this.
[4126.34s -> 4131.27s]  I'm sorry. Stop. Nobody say that for the rest of this room. I don't want to hear that ever again.
[4131.99s -> 4159.48s]  Is he not up here? He is up here. I need the hover. Maybe I don't.
[4166.84s -> 4207.75s]  He's blind. He's blind. He's blind. He's blind. He's blind. Found him. Really? Aha. Right in the back.
[4207.75s -> 4221.91s]  Get him. Hey, you. Get back here. How much more do I have to hit you?
[4224.81s -> 4264.97s]  Ah. Ow. Oh. Can this fucking hit him? Why is this not hitting him? Earth is happening.
[4264.97s -> 4300.49s]  Are you seriously moving all the way over there? Mom, my game's broken. I can't go this far. Shoot,
[4300.49s -> 4308.58s]  I was supposed to rocket jump. This game makes me thirsty. This game makes me want to pee.
[4309.30s -> 4314.63s]  This game makes me have to piss. It actually was the original title of the stream,
[4314.63s -> 4335.66s]  but people were upset by it, so I had to get rid of it. Damn it. Oh. All right, I made it.
[4335.66s -> 4351.34s]  Does it wink? Chain? Chomplets? Unchained. I hate this place. I hate this place. This place. I hate
[4351.34s -> 4358.07s]  this place. Why? Best level, worst level. This level sucks. Does it suck?
[4358.07s -> 4381.82s]  Um. This place looks like a modded Call of Duty Zombies level. Hey, Mister, I think you could spare
[4381.82s -> 4389.18s]  us a hand. This dear lady's pets have decided to go on a little rampage. No, no, no, no. Not
[4389.18s -> 4407.02s]  the bees. They seem to be acting normal. So we have to put out the, uh, the chomps. All right,
[4407.02s -> 4419.22s]  that's not bad. That's not bad. What's wrong with this place? They're lighting on fire again. I'm
[4419.22s -> 4431.75s]  trying, I'm preventing it from happening. Maybe I should clean the area first. Come here. Do they
[4431.75s -> 4444.33s]  have to go back in a cage or anything? Is it, is it, I'm trying to get them back in their pen or
[4444.33s -> 4465.06s]  something? Try cooling its head off. I just did. Okay. Do I have to get them all in a certain time
[4465.06s -> 4484.55s]  limit or something? How many are there? Two? Three? There's one other one right here. Okay, now what?
[4484.87s -> 4515.53s]  Ow. I, well, okay. You can, I grabbed their tails and throw them into the pens. Do I have to open
[4515.53s -> 4527.13s]  them or something? Or into the, throw them in, where's their water? Come on, come here. Go in
[4527.13s -> 4551.66s]  there. Am I killing it? Okay. I think that's what I need to do. Do the other ones. All right. Let's
[4551.66s -> 4555.10s]  go. Let's do the thing that everyone said. Do it, dude. What are you stupid idiot? Do it.
[4556.06s -> 4566.42s]  Now there's two more. I don't hate this place. Am I going to hate this place? I don't hate this
[4566.42s -> 4582.07s]  place. Wait, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here. I didn't get it. Now
[4582.07s -> 4598.28s]  stop, stop, stay right there. Don't move. Okay. One more. I just saw you. Where are you? Over here?
[4599.24s -> 4622.78s]  Right here? Right here? Like that. There you are. Come here. Come here. I used to do that all the
[4622.78s -> 4628.73s]  time versus Bowser in Mario 64. You would do that and miss and then you'd fucking fly off a cliff
[4628.73s -> 4633.13s]  and smash the controller into the ground and it would explode into like 5,000 pieces.
[4647.62s -> 4656.47s]  What? Am I saying mama? Come here. You have to go this way. All right. Got a clear shot.
[4658.02s -> 4670.01s]  Eight ball, corner pocket and go. Yeah. That was like a wicked annoying thing to say. I'm aware.
[4670.57s -> 4679.32s]  Eight ball, corner pocket. Yeah. I know that was, that was annoying, but whatever.
[4689.78s -> 4694.90s]  You guys just have no idea how exhausting it is to pretend every day. I brought this up yesterday.
[4694.90s -> 4706.38s]  It's, I'm just exhausted. What's it been an hour? God fucking tired. Remember to pretend
[4707.58s -> 4714.22s]  in every video game, one hour of pretending is actually like two to three hours of being
[4714.22s -> 4723.38s]  normal. I'm exerting 300% more mental fortitude. Man, I'm just fucking tired. Let's go back in.
[4732.15s -> 4749.90s]  Oh no, it's a race. I feel bad for the people that don't know that's a joke.
[4750.94s -> 4762.58s]  And they're just like, what the fuck, man? It's me, Paintissimo. And now listen, see that flag over
[4762.58s -> 4792.87s]  there. Hmm. That flag up there. Are you ready? Three, two, one, go. Three, two, go. Oh, I fucked
[4792.87s -> 4834.18s]  it up. I just, first time I've been on the level, guys. I don't speak cursive. Actually, cursive is
[4834.18s -> 4838.28s]  out of the, you'll be right, cursive is out like this. If I was speaking cursive, if it was out
[4838.28s -> 4841.40s]  like this, every single word, every single, everything would fall right into each other.
[4842.36s -> 4859.54s]  Every single word, there would be no beginning of any senses. That's correct. Oh, the crack's
[4859.54s -> 4867.58s]  kicking in. Crack's kicking in. Crack's kicking in. Crack's kicking in. Three, two, one, go.
[4873.78s -> 4903.03s]  Smelly a little. Kick head. Don't do that. Just run. Oh, that was not so bad. You're quick. Yes.
[4903.59s -> 4908.54s]  I suppose maybe I underestimated you a small bit. Perhaps you try again after you have practiced
[4908.54s -> 4944.58s]  more until then. Bye bye. Go to the hotel. Go to the hotel. I don't know what that is.
[4945.22s -> 4952.63s]  Don't stop spoiling the game. You're spoiling the game for me. I don't know what that is.
[4952.63s -> 4961.48s]  You just ruined it. How am I going to enjoy the game ever again now? I want to do this again.
[4966.25s -> 4985.27s]  Goopy Inferno. Oh, all the way.
[4989.18s -> 5001.66s]  No flood. Just my skills as a platform gamer. Can we talk? It's really tough being mayor,
[5001.66s -> 5007.02s]  don't you think? I've never been a mayor. I have no idea. It might be really easy for all I know.
[5007.74s -> 5038.18s]  All right. What do I got to get up there? Fine. Um, okay. Okay. Well, there's uh, all right. So
[5038.18s -> 5047.58s]  maybe I want to hear a coin. What are you going to do? Animal Crossing New Leaf. Um,
[5047.58s -> 5061.32s]  I'm just gonna play the new one. What's going on? Nintendo. Nintendo. I need you to. Thank you.
[5062.04s -> 5084.71s]  Can I get up there? Can I climb the tree? I can go over there. I'm just gonna.
[5091.58s -> 5113.66s]  I have to jump on these guy's heads. Oh, you're hurting him. So do I have to just bounce?
[5114.06s -> 5125.90s]  I don't know. That almost worked. Almost. I'm not done with this. I'm, I'm having a fun time at
[5125.90s -> 5157.67s]  face when Mario isn't there to save you because you are Mario. Who saves Mario? I mean, like,
[5157.67s -> 5162.55s]  guys, Mario is not invincible. I mean, just because he has a series of video games doesn't
[5162.55s -> 5165.83s]  mean that if he gets hit by a car, he's not going to break all of his bones and shit.
[5171.19s -> 5192.15s]  I have to bounce on these. So I'm going to try if I could do it. It'd be nice. They go all the
[5192.15s -> 5207.05s]  way over there. Right on these things. None of them are made out of water or anything.
[5208.25s -> 5237.14s]  Wink. All right. Fine. Here's water. What about down here? What's this? Well, I figured it out,
[5250.17s -> 5259.21s]  but where do I go up from here? How do I climb this up? Oh, wait, I can move this thing.
[5259.93s -> 5283.19s]  Why is it doing that? What? I rumble. I don't have any more coffee left. Disaster. Well,
[5283.19s -> 5294.81s]  I know where to go. Dude, we're going to get some fucking dunks. You know what I mean? We're
[5294.81s -> 5328.65s]  going to get the fucking dunks. Let's try this again. Watch out. You got to slam dunk on LeBron.
[5330.94s -> 5352.73s]  No, I can't. No, stop. Oh, wait, there's a coin. 46 blue coins. Nice. Again. Here we go.
[5353.37s -> 5361.75s]  Remember, there was a blue coin billionaire. What do blue coins do? Uh, I don't know. I'm
[5361.75s -> 5367.62s]  thinking you spend them on stuff. But I don't have a lot. I don't know. I didn't play this game.
[5368.50s -> 5374.97s]  Can you grab on to the- why are we- I'm trying to grab onto the- why can I not grab on?
[5375.77s -> 5378.33s]  I'm trying to just climb up to the top and just grab the top.
[5379.13s -> 5397.02s]  I have to jump off it? I can't just grab? I have to jump up into it. Shit, I just said the fucking
[5397.02s -> 5404.92s]  Voldemort name. Wait, why am I all the way back here? Oh, because I had game over.
[5409.56s -> 5414.31s]  I don't want to do that. I want to do something else. Where am I going? Where have I not done
[5414.31s -> 5432.78s]  everything? Park. Harbor. I haven't done Bianco Hills, the whole thing. You have the Yoshi.
[5433.50s -> 5455.06s]  Where the hell was the Yoshi? Over here, right? Whoa, what's up there? Wait, what's a bell?
[5455.70s -> 5486.39s]  I'm gonna clean this bell. No, I won't. All right, bell. This thing is dirty as hell. Nice.
[5487.03s -> 5500.14s]  How does one get inside? I see. I see. I gotta go in one of those things.
[5501.10s -> 5520.12s]  Whoa, right there. Can I get up there from here? Bang a left? I need to get all the way down. I
[5520.12s -> 5531.96s]  need to get up- how do I get over there? It's gonna be a weird way to get there.
[5532.60s -> 5551.38s]  All right, a bang of right? No, it's up there. I gotta use my mind's eye. All right, here's- this
[5551.38s -> 5563.64s]  is it over here. What the fuck? What's going on with this one? This funny streamer is unaware.
[5563.64s -> 5580.98s]  You think I'm funny? Thanks. Do you really? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Funny looking. Still
[5580.98s -> 5612.30s]  counts. I gotta clean that thing. I'm going over there. All right, let's get up there.
[5617.62s -> 5623.30s]  So how do I do that? I can probably- can I just rocket jump from here?
[5623.30s -> 5649.88s]  Maybe. Is it just that simple? It might be that simple. It's so easy. That's kind of high.
[5651.16s -> 5683.03s]  You forgot to put it down. You gotta bring it down for me. Okay. All right, do I go back in the pipe?
[5683.03s -> 5690.66s]  Yeah, I'm gonna go for it. Get pineapple on roof. Get pineapple on roof. I'm up here though.
[5691.90s -> 5697.02s]  Roof, pineapple, roof, pineapple. No, I'm already up here. No, I'm not. It just put me back to the
[5697.02s -> 5710.17s]  beginning. All right, fine. Pineapple on that roof. Roof, pineapple. Sure. Tongue glasses. Roof,
[5710.17s -> 5740.06s]  pineapple first. Hold on. Important. Roof, pineapple. All right, just throw it up there.
[5740.86s -> 5758.73s]  Bounce off this guy's head. Throw it up there. All right, I can do this. Hey, you- what?
[5761.19s -> 5800.47s]  Your taste changed. Yoshi. So what was the point of me getting the Yoshi up here?
[5801.66s -> 5812.95s]  I walk somewhere with him over like the- on the tightrope. It went right through it. It went
[5812.95s -> 5819.85s]  right through the rope. Can I get up back up here? All right, pineapple. Eat the pineapple.
[5823.10s -> 5842.55s]  Eat the pineapple on the roof. You guys on drugs? Roof, pineapple. There's a roof pair.
[5843.35s -> 5862.79s]  Wait, you're talking about the- wait, that? The giant pineapple decoration? Not an actual pineapple
[5862.79s -> 5872.66s]  from like the shop. You're talking about the roof decoration. I didn't know you could eat that.
[5874.34s -> 5878.98s]  That's a decoration. That's a decoration. That's not- oh, eat the fruit on the roof.
[5879.54s -> 5885.51s]  You should have said eat the decorative pineapple. That's what you needed to say. You said eat the
[5885.51s -> 5890.15s]  pineapple on the roof. No, no, no. Eat decorative pineapple. I would have got it immediately.
[5890.71s -> 5926.01s]  Arena Beach. The manta storm. Where's Yoshi? He didn't get to come with me. It's kind of unfair.
[5927.83s -> 5941.16s]  What's going on up here? Why are you guys inside a pipe? I heard this is a great hotel. I can't
[5941.16s -> 5955.10s]  wait to see my room. What a cool looking sunset. Spectacular. Two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[5955.10s -> 5992.12s]  eight. Eight coins. Good. Look at the sunset. Fine. Let's go. Uh, you probably should do something
[5992.12s -> 6006.10s]  about that. Your stairs are killing people. Uh, okay. Well, what's your problem?
[6007.51s -> 6011.59s]  Oh, please tell me my nightmare is over. You can save me. I don't know why, but just look at the
[6011.59s -> 6016.07s]  very- just look- you just look very capable. Listen, it all started around noon. This giant
[6016.07s -> 6022.23s]  manta-shaped thing showed up. It was this paper, thin, floating silhouette. It came and covered
[6022.23s -> 6027.75s]  the hotel grounds in this electric goop. Then, oh, the horror in my beautiful hotel, my poor
[6027.75s -> 6033.74s]  building. It sank in the middle of that awful ooze. Why me? I've got the staff cleaning up,
[6033.74s -> 6039.51s]  but where's my hotel? What am I supposed to do? I can't just sit back and, uh, it's- it's back.
[6039.51s -> 6054.30s]  That gossamer ghoul. Do something. Holy shit. This thing's pretty big. This song's kind of banging.
[6056.15s -> 6072.78s]  All right, what- can I shoot it? You can clean it. It's cleanable. Here it comes. Okay, what does
[6072.78s -> 6081.67s]  that mean? Get out of the water, Mario. Mario, don't you know? This is shut- spraying the water
[6081.67s -> 6097.86s]  causes it to divide. Is it- is this thing even here? I tell you, this game is Spining of Isaac.
[6098.66s -> 6102.50s]  This whole game is Spining of Isaac. All right, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump. Out,
[6102.50s -> 6135.94s]  out, out, out, out, out. Get coins. Save from the trees. God. All right, we're getting crunches.
[6136.50s -> 6157.72s]  Yeah, we're getting crunchies. I don't know why. All right, where is he? There you are. They're all
[6157.72s -> 6176.17s]  stuck on- they're all stuck on the top of that thing. God. I need water. Oh my god, the crunches.
[6176.81s -> 6204.82s]  I gotta turn it down. I can't hear these crunches, man. Give me that shit. Where's the water?
[6204.82s -> 6231.67s]  They are dividing into smaller units. I know. Die! Wait, are they co- are they going back together
[6231.67s -> 6251.30s]  again? They're reconnecting, aren't they? Give me that. I need more coins. Trees. Get out of the
[6251.30s -> 6285.06s]  water, Mario. I need that tree. All right, let me get a look. No, no, they're everywhere.
[6287.06s -> 6305.08s]  This is- holy shit. Get to work. I've- oh no. Okay, I'm gonna start- I'm gonna start over here.
[6305.08s -> 6362.87s]  Come on. They're all in the ocean over here. Okay, here we go. Over here. I gotta get in there. Oh,
[6362.87s -> 6388.12s]  look at that shit. All right, we're doing good. Not bad. I'm not breaking these boxes. Holy shit.
[6388.12s -> 6397.00s]  Now they're all after you. What? Oh my- get in the tree, Mario. Mario, get in a tree.
[6411.88s -> 6436.49s]  Just spray from afar. It's working. All right, back to the ocean. Ow, you fucker.
[6453.11s -> 6505.74s]  Okay, easy, easy. That was crazy. All right, now turn the volume back up. Now that we can actually
[6505.74s -> 6544.55s]  hear. It's not crunchy audio. You did it. I did. Yeah. That was kind of fun. I'm just not even
[6544.55s -> 6548.55s]  gonna look. Should I just throw it behind me? I mean, I'm like half court. Let me just like-
[6549.35s -> 6577.91s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, look at this. Look at this shit. Look at this. You ready? Okay, there.
[6577.91s -> 6615.85s]  Okay. Wait, you didn't hear it? But it didn't swish? It's a swish.
[6616.33s -> 6630.95s]  It bounced. I missed. I missed each time. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Redo, redo, redo. That means I'm-
[6632.47s -> 6645.50s]  Oh god damn it. Shit, it wasn't even that fucking hard.
[6645.50s -> 6675.70s]  I just got in. It doesn't go in and come out. No, I want- Fuck man, why is it so hard to find this?
[6675.70s -> 6690.18s]  Basketball swish. Why is this so difficult to get this? Somebody make this video and you'll get
[6690.18s -> 6697.05s]  like 10,000 views. Just make a swish sound if I put it on YouTube. You'll get like 100,000 views.
[6698.74s -> 6702.81s]  Okay, that finally found it. Never mind. Thanks for uploading that. God damn it. I'm holding on
[6702.81s -> 6722.97s]  to this. I don't fucking care. I'm holding on to that. Right. Oh, here's a swish. It was a
[6722.97s -> 6727.69s]  basketball fucking bouncing and hitting a rim and shit. Because I can't hear it. I just have-
[6728.41s -> 6732.57s]  Right now I have the game audio in my ears. I can't have both because the way that it's-
[6732.57s -> 6754.84s]  the game is captured. Whatever. All right, let's go in the hotel. It's Mario, right? Yeah, Mario.
[6755.48s -> 6760.04s]  Listen, I have a feeling you can help me out again. Do the hotel as well. It's full of
[6760.04s -> 6765.67s]  ghosts. Is this a Mario? Wait, is this Luigi's Mansion tie-in or something?
[6765.67s -> 6770.39s]  So we- well, could you maybe look- just come inside. I can tell you're a miracle worker.
[6770.39s -> 6789.61s]  Don't be so modest. When did the original Luigi's Mansion come on? They turn into platforms. Oh boy.
[6791.37s -> 6809.02s]  This is going to be interesting. The place looks familiar. This is the Mario 64 place.
[6809.02s -> 6831.02s]  This looks just like it. Hey, can I go in here? Do I need the thing to run through
[6832.07s -> 6846.38s]  the doors? Maybe I should talk to the guy first. Hold on. Fire. Wait, I can actually open the doors.
[6849.62s -> 6858.44s]  Nope. You're invading somebody's privacy. There's nobody in this hotel. I'm the cleaning person.
[6858.44s -> 6878.89s]  None of these open. All right, dude. Well, I can't help you. You gotta help me.
[6880.57s -> 6887.35s]  Give me the key. At this rate, I'll never get back home. Can you do something, please, Mario?
[6891.78s -> 6909.86s]  Well, I'll try. No guarantees. Toilet? Oh, they're dirty toilets. Wait, these are not dirty toilets.
[6917.83s -> 6930.07s]  They just look like that. Oh, what's this in here?
[6936.31s -> 6946.65s]  Shit decal. This place looks like a fucking bowling alley. Why? No, it doesn't.
[6950.97s -> 6956.68s]  Um, all right. What do I do here? Is it like a fire flower or something?
[6956.68s -> 6985.67s]  Do we go up higher? Okay, well, we go higher. Oh, there's another. Okay. Well, it was confusing.
[6988.68s -> 6992.76s]  That should not be in the game. That shouldn't be in the game. That's like unfair and it messes you
[6992.76s -> 6997.08s]  up and makes you think that there's coins and shit. That's unfair. They should take this out
[6997.08s -> 7019.69s]  of the game. Are they all closed? Oh, look, it's Pac-Man. Hold on. Anything else over here?
[7027.05s -> 7037.61s]  Oh, you have that in you though. Doesn't that mean you have that? That's so joked. I got joked.
[7038.17s -> 7056.98s]  Well, let's go in. See what happens. Three, two, one. Here we go. The secret level. Oh, great. This is
[7056.98s -> 7068.31s]  gonna be fun. I love the background. That's the kind of shit that I want in my office. Those lights.
[7068.31s -> 7084.41s]  What are they called? Uh, light brights. Light bright. Oh, I can break these. I gotta be careful.
[7084.41s -> 7102.30s]  I don't want to break too many of them. What's the watermelon for? I think I may have just made a
[7102.30s -> 7116.79s]  mistake. No, I'm okay, right? Bounce and just make it take us low. Okay, that's sand. Uh, it's gonna
[7116.79s -> 7136.10s]  fall. Let's go. Waiting too long. You're probably asking yourself, why are you leaving that?
[7136.10s -> 7147.72s]  Because I could have, see, I could have been bad. Uh, which way? Okay, there's the psycho way.
[7149.08s -> 7154.70s]  I'm thinking about going the psycho route. Psycho route is get to the second one here and then jump
[7154.70s -> 7169.24s]  all the way over to the right side. I'm doing the psycho route. I almost had it. It was close. It
[7169.24s -> 7186.01s]  just went a little too far. Oh, I can get it. I can get the psycho route. I can do this an
[7186.01s -> 7199.94s]  infinite amount of times though. That's the one good thing. Get that camera in a good spot.
[7234.49s -> 7252.55s]  All right, so just, but, uh, I can't reach that. That platform, that move? That shit move?
[7254.52s -> 7277.93s]  That shit moves, right? I fucking seriously, I went like a tiny bit too far. I was trying to
[7277.93s -> 7304.31s]  be so slow with it and you pressed a stick a tenth of a centimeter and come on. It was such a pain
[7304.31s -> 7350.78s]  in the ass to get over there with the psycho route. Saved it. I almost fucked it up. All right,
[7351.34s -> 7360.66s]  there we go. All right, I just have to jump. Don't walk over it. If you walk over it,
[7361.14s -> 7395.11s]  you go all the way over the edge. Just be careful. Get that. Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit.
[7395.83s -> 7414.01s]  I'm getting tuber. Sometimes it just comes out. I have, you have to like, it's okay. You know,
[7414.01s -> 7418.74s]  when they tell you, when, when you fight any fighter, like the karate or a taekwondo or
[7418.74s -> 7423.94s]  something, don't they say you need to expel air and force out of you? You know, you have to like,
[7424.90s -> 7431.78s]  the same thing is with video games. When you throw a punch in karate, you need to
[7432.73s -> 7440.65s]  exhale. Same thing when you're playing a game, you want to make a jump. That's correct. Tennis
[7440.65s -> 7450.57s]  is another one. Yeah, this is true. This is true statement. I'm not making that up.
[7456.76s -> 7486.28s]  Pitchers do it too. Yeah. And so don't streamers. Oh, I hurt my chest. Streaming is karate. No,
[7486.28s -> 7498.81s]  no, no, excuse me. That's a false. That's, that is what we call a false equivalency.
[7499.53s -> 7513.34s]  I never said that. I didn't even read what he said. I lost it when I heard this was a four star
[7513.34s -> 7525.26s]  resort. I mean, come on water damage in the restrooms. That is so low class. It's not some
[7525.26s -> 7538.58s]  weight. What's this guy doing? Ooh, pineapple. My apologies, but the casino, excuse me. What would
[7538.58s -> 7553.58s]  the word something about that words? Exciting me is not open for business quite yet. I need
[7553.58s -> 7567.19s]  a pineapple. Uh, these free pineapple, pineapple, pineapple, pineapple, no pineapples over there.
[7567.83s -> 7584.33s]  No, let's go upstairs. This level is unironically so good. It's, it's pretty fun. I don't, I don't
[7584.33s -> 7591.06s]  mind. I miss Lammy. Like I'm Jammer Lammy. You miss I'm Jammer Lammy. I beat the game
[7591.94s -> 7612.44s]  multiple times at coin. I'm leaving it for later. Where's the pineapple? Oh shit. Nice open free.
[7613.32s -> 7621.82s]  This is free. This shit's just for free. Hey, that sparkle, could it be a shine sprite? Um,
[7621.82s -> 7643.61s]  yeah, move out of the way. Hey you, no one in the pool without proper swimwear. I mean, what was
[7643.61s -> 7663.18s]  that? Hello? I get a really creepy vibe from this weird painting, but you want to know what I find
[7663.18s -> 7674.30s]  even creepier than that? Imagining how you got in here. You need pineapples? Fucking Nintendo.
[7674.30s -> 7709.90s]  Uh, oh, okay. Creepy. Creepy. Cool. Uh, hi guys. Eek. What's wrong? The coin's fake. It's not even
[7709.90s -> 7721.03s]  moving. That's a bad, terrible. I knew it. See? I'll get it. Stop running around. I want to talk to
[7721.03s -> 7734.65s]  you. Stop running around. Suddenly a ghost came out of the closet. I'll handle it. Double tap
[7734.65s -> 7768.76s]  right there. All right. Anything else in here? What about over there? Make the picture. All right.
[7768.76s -> 7774.54s]  What about you? Everybody has like their own personal pool. Do something about these ghosts
[7774.54s -> 7792.90s]  and get out of my room, you weirdo. Oh shit. There we go. Where the fuck am I? This is ridiculous.
[7792.90s -> 7803.00s]  This is crazy. I like this level. It's fun. I think the bed's made out of ghost. Wait a minute.
[7803.00s -> 7834.41s]  Where did you come from? I'm calling for help. Oh, but hold on. Uh, hi. Another room, I guess.
[7834.97s -> 7846.70s]  Streamer wet the bed. I did not. Well, where did I put that thing? Hey, have you seen a pineapple
[7846.70s -> 7876.09s]  anywhere around here? Let's look. Pineapples? Anywhere in here? Pineapple? I don't see a
[7876.09s -> 7885.13s]  pineapple in here. Hey, whatever. It's super coin. Yeah. All right. Hold on. Do you have
[7899.51s -> 7922.30s]  pineapple? Hey, found a, uh, another room. Cool. I found a pineapple. Nice. Cool.
[7923.34s -> 7934.62s]  It's a friend. It's just for fun. Pineapple. How do I move this guy out of the way?
[7936.84s -> 7947.59s]  Oh, there's more than one pineapple here. There's pineapples everywhere.
[7947.59s -> 7977.08s]  Is it going to eventually work? Can I open the door? Is door locked? Wait, what? Wait, what?
[7977.08s -> 7983.64s]  What? What? What? Why is the door locked behind me? Why? Why would the door lock behind me?
[7984.28s -> 8000.62s]  Are you kidding me? Oh my God. Oh, the door locked behind you. Oh, for the love of fucking God,
[8000.62s -> 8032.12s]  I have to do this whole thing again. Mario, you're a moron. Make sure to lock the door behind you
[8032.12s -> 8043.94s]  from the inside, Mario. From the inside. Yeah. Good. How do we trust you with all this bullshit?
[8051.16s -> 8090.20s]  Get out of my way. Okay. Give me a pineapple. Okay. Got a pineapple. Excuse me. Bye. Here you go.
[8090.20s -> 8108.57s]  Oh, Yoshi. Make them pay. All right. I got Yoshi. Now we go up. We eat the ghost in front of the
[8108.57s -> 8143.75s]  door. I guarantee it. If that's not what I have to do, I will... Why is this door open? Oh, hi there.
[8144.81s -> 8155.88s]  My door's open and there's nothing to be suspicious of. How about a game of Jax? Ha ha ha. I thought
[8155.88s -> 8185.37s]  they were ghosts. Oh, sorry. Oh, yeah, right. What are you doing up here? All these ghosts
[8185.37s -> 8188.81s]  are causing us trouble. They're everywhere. Why can't someone come along and suck them up
[8188.81s -> 8207.80s]  with a vacuum? Why are you looking at me like that? Yoshi is just so good. What a little good boy.
[8207.80s -> 8225.51s]  You know what I mean? I'm going to get lost up here. That's a guarantee. He didn't get the coin.
[8226.23s -> 8242.01s]  Sorry. What does it take for Yoshi to die? Yoshi doesn't just die, right? You run out of juice.
[8242.01s -> 8281.24s]  Is that for real? What? Eat him. Okay. What the hell am I... I think everything's clear.
[8281.24s -> 8310.73s]  Can I go in the middle somehow? He's dying. Oh, he is. Of course I get stuck in the door. Okay.
[8310.73s -> 8324.06s]  I need another pineapple. Wait. It might not be a pineapple. Check. It is a pineapple. Come on.
[8324.06s -> 8345.32s]  I got to unlock the pineapple. This should be a banana at this point. I don't need him anymore?
[8345.32s -> 8367.94s]  All right. I guess I did clear it all. What's the goal though? What am I trying to get to?
[8370.49s -> 8397.90s]  Oh, look at this. Hey, remember me? Pineapple. What was the point of this? Oh, okay. I need a
[8397.90s -> 8404.14s]  Yoshi. Please don't... Is that still there? Don't disappear. It doesn't disappear, right? Fruit
[8404.14s -> 8418.66s]  doesn't disappear. It stays. Come here. Let's go. All right. Eat a bunch of fruit. Let's move.
[8419.62s -> 8437.21s]  How come Yoshi doesn't die in that water? What's up with that? It's too shallow. If you step into an
[8437.21s -> 8442.63s]  inch of water with Yoshi on the beach, he dies. Is he a slug? I don't understand. Salt water?
[8459.93s -> 8486.68s]  Kill you. So, we got a... There's a blue... The blue sofa looks suspicious. Doesn't it? Nintendo.
[8486.68s -> 8526.68s]  What's the point of any of this? The door? The crack that I'm missing? I think so. Or the walls.
[8526.68s -> 8545.10s]  Anything on the walls? That's it. Okay. Well, can I go back up? Can I just leave? Throw the door.
[8545.10s -> 8565.78s]  Can't open? We need to go back up. Is there another... I think there's another tile thing.
[8567.91s -> 8589.83s]  Get in there. I don't know how that's possible to fall. Like, I'm gonna buy a lottery ticket
[8589.83s -> 8624.97s]  tonight. Okay. Is... Over there. Is there a crack tile over there? Yep. And I'm seeing quite a few
[8624.97s -> 8629.53s]  Pogchamps in the chat, but I need to correct you. I gotta have... I'm gonna cloud this because I
[8629.53s -> 8635.90s]  should. In the time it took me just to do that, I could have walked around the whole level two or
[8635.90s -> 8650.26s]  three times. Take that. Hey, have you lost your mind? You can't just barge into a lady's room.
[8650.26s -> 8669.46s]  It's just not done. Get out. Shoo, shoo. What's that? Anything in here? Paintings? Yep. Anything
[8669.46s -> 8679.42s]  else? You wanted me to leave, lady? Are you sure you didn't want me to exorcist Puke around your
[8679.42s -> 8704.31s]  whole hotel room? Oh, sorry. What's this charge of $750? Well, there was exorcist Puke all over
[8704.31s -> 8712.14s]  your room, ma'am. You don't understand. I didn't do that. A strange little man with a mustache
[8712.14s -> 8718.28s]  thrown in on a dinosaur and he puked all over the place. Okay, lady. Just pay the fucking deposit,
[8718.28s -> 8738.52s]  please. No, I'm not crazy. It happened. Am I missing something? Wait, like up here?
[8739.16s -> 8753.74s]  I'm back. What was it? Nothing down there? There has to be something down here. What would be the
[8753.74s -> 8786.79s]  point of you coming down here? Just don't. Blue coin? Fuck. All right. Is there another tile that
[8786.79s -> 8796.47s]  I didn't do? Ah, over there. Fruit fly brain. Fruit flies are for their size. The electrons
[8796.47s -> 8803.58s]  and neutrons in their brains are actually a thousand times their body weight. So if I
[8803.58s -> 8813.56s]  am a scaled up fruit fly, then see, that's a mistake on your part. Ended up back down here.
[8814.20s -> 8858.07s]  Okay. Did I go there? Is there one over there? There is. Wait, yeah. If I was a scaled up fruit
[8858.07s -> 8863.35s]  fly, you guys, I would be able to control shit with my brain and be able to move objects with
[8863.35s -> 8869.51s]  my thoughts. You think I'm that intelligent? You're flattering me, but thank you. I got it.
[8883.67s -> 8896.57s]  You're giving flies way too much credit. Why does it still want me to go that way?
[8905.93s -> 8917.22s]  I'm going in there. It so badly wants me to be over there. Have I done almost everything here?
[8917.22s -> 8924.06s]  Six. The shell's secret. I see flies move stuff with their brain all the time.
[8924.86s -> 8937.35s]  I've got to get in the shell. Oh yes. Oh yes. I don't need to listen to that. I know what to do.
[8954.14s -> 8979.34s]  This place is cool. I like this place. This level is pretty pog. Shut up. Shut up.
[8980.30s -> 8985.10s]  I, I, you, you can do it. I can't do it though. I can't, I can't say that. You can say that. I
[8985.10s -> 9025.91s]  can't. Am I your parents? I've got to go in there. Oh shit. Fucking Nintendo.
[9033.72s -> 9060.39s]  All right. I'm at about enough of this. I'm trying to skip this part. Wall jump.
[9067.83s -> 9075.37s]  Uh, whatever. Don't talk about that. I think I can just make, I'm just going over here.
[9076.09s -> 9096.18s]  Right. Can I make this? I got to go over there. Uh, I'm going up a little higher. What's this?
[9096.98s -> 9121.43s]  A yellow button. Press it. I don't, I don't care. Uh, okay. I got to get over. Can I land on one of
[9121.43s -> 9136.98s]  these, uh, ropes? I need to go from here to there. I got to go the other way. I need water too. Can I
[9137.54s -> 9150.73s]  can I? All right. Go water. All right. Let's go. People just like, oh, he fell again. No,
[9150.73s -> 9155.62s]  that was intentional. It was an intentional fall. We're going to go with that way.
[9171.96s -> 9196.06s]  Just walk. Just walk. Camera is, why are you doing this? Stop moving around.
[9199.69s -> 9225.02s]  Kill this thing. Oh my God. What's going on? Get off me. Get off me. Get off of me. Why is it on me?
[9225.82s -> 9229.70s]  Please let on something. Please let on something. Please let on something. Please let.
[9230.26s -> 9282.60s]  So I'm going to move over here and we'll go from here. I did it.
[9294.76s -> 9305.83s]  Doesn't look that bad until you get up. Where am I? Seven lives by the way. Be careful. Oh,
[9305.83s -> 9319.30s]  I could have just jumped off. Is there a one up anywhere? All right. This doesn't push you off.
[9319.30s -> 9322.74s]  I got another whole another rotation. No, I got to be on this end.
[9323.30s -> 9336.92s]  No, I got to be on this end. I got to be on this end now. Okay. And then, right. Okay.
[9349.82s -> 9361.88s]  I got scared. We ran into the wall and got scared. I didn't want to press jump again.
[9361.88s -> 9386.76s]  Karma, please hit the nails. Does that do anything? I'm gonna laugh my ass off if this
[9386.76s -> 9392.23s]  makes a bridge over here. So if I, am I going to get a one up from doing this?
[9392.95s -> 9410.20s]  That would be really, really annoying if I did. It's just two coins. I'm not doing that again.
[9410.20s -> 9429.93s]  There. I did it. I don't have to do that ever again. All right. Let's try this again. No
[9429.93s -> 9433.61s]  hesitation. No hesitation. Just go. Ready? And now I'm going to do it right now. And here we go.
[9434.25s -> 9497.27s]  You missed nails. I'm not going for nails. This is not nails percent. What is this I'm going to do?
[9497.27s -> 9507.70s]  Run up this? Um, I can slide. Run up? Am I sliding off of this thing? Can you slide? Let's test it.
[9507.78s -> 9525.34s]  You slide off. You slide off. Um, okay. Did the wall, I have to, you have to wall jump off the wall.
[9525.34s -> 9531.69s]  Or can I run across? Do I have to wall jump and then into the, can I just jump over?
[9532.57s -> 9545.40s]  I mean, the camera zoomed right up my ass. So I couldn't tell what the fuck I was going.
[9561.46s -> 9562.42s]  No, I don't care about the nails.
[9566.57s -> 9571.21s]  Fuck the nails. Fuck the nails. Fuck the, I don't care about the nails. The nails can go to hell.
[9571.21s -> 9576.65s]  Okay. I'm not touching a nail for the rest of my life. Even in my own home construction projects.
[9576.65s -> 9580.97s]  I'm never going to use one. I'm not going to pick my hammer. I'm not never hammering a nail in.
[9580.97s -> 9599.18s]  I got here so quickly too. I was like so focused. Hammer, you missed the nails.
[9606.02s -> 9626.12s]  How's about that? I almost jumped off.
[9626.92s -> 9633.88s]  I almost jumped off. I would have been, I would have taken a, I would have gone BRB.
[9633.88s -> 9637.48s]  I would not have sat here for that. I would, I didn't, I wouldn't even want to see the chat.
[9637.48s -> 9642.52s]  I would leave for 10 minutes. All right. Stop zooming in. Okay. So if I just run up and jump,
[9642.52s -> 9662.89s]  just go fuck it. Go. Holy shit. Okay. How we go up and then shit.
[9662.89s -> 9668.54s]  Okay. So I have to wall jump off here.
[9673.26s -> 9679.58s]  Holy motherfucker. Oh, that was very, very bad, but I did it correct somehow. I don't,
[9679.58s -> 9686.38s]  that was incorrect. So wait, left wall into back wall or back wall into,
[9690.04s -> 9698.86s]  left wall into back wall, I think. Right. Or back wall into left wall or just back wall into,
[9698.86s -> 9710.57s]  just go. I landed on an invisible ground.
[9758.82s -> 9762.26s]  This one's moving too fast. Look at how fast it's going.
[9781.90s -> 9797.14s]  What the fuck? Okay. Now we just jump onto the, just don't, just forget about that. The ground
[9797.14s -> 9881.10s]  is moving. That doesn't matter. You got to do a, oh, I feel so bad. I feel so bad right now.
[9881.90s -> 9888.86s]  You know what I mean? Like I just, I, I feel just, I just feel very bad because that's so,
[9888.86s -> 9895.58s]  oh, I, I have to do it again. Oh, I feel, I feel very bad. Oh, it's okay. I'll get it.
[9896.54s -> 9904.95s]  Okay. You have to do a slide, a side jump onto it because you can't make it. Oh,
[9906.63s -> 9913.11s]  you may have hit the nail too. And then I was just, you've not hit the nail. Fuck.
[9916.47s -> 9925.40s]  Okay. Here we go. And sometimes the side jump, I can't get that shit to work.
[9925.40s -> 9950.66s]  Sorry. I just had to, there was just a, I just had to let some air out of a balloon for a second.
[9957.88s -> 9967.06s]  I thought I had it. Oh, you got, it's like, look, if you give up a home run,
[9967.06s -> 9971.22s]  you got to pitch the next inning. You know what I mean? If you give up a fucking grand slam,
[9971.22s -> 9974.18s]  you can't just like be like, I gave him a grand slam. I'm going to give up every grand slam.
[9974.18s -> 9977.62s]  Every hit is going to be a grand slam. You got to, you got to get out of your head. Here we go.
[9978.58s -> 10005.80s]  What was that face? Now I'm just rushing. It's such a far away to get up there.
[10008.97s -> 10022.36s]  Grand slam. Here. Boom. Here. Double.
[10025.72s -> 10030.36s]  Oh, I had it. I had it. I did it. Like, I had like, it's like, you're waking up from a nightmare.
[10030.36s -> 10047.14s]  You don't even mean like you missed the last jump. It's like a nightmare. Wait. Okay. This is not
[10047.14s -> 10055.19s]  that bad. Getting up here. It's when they start turning on you. You lose them to a kid's game.
[10057.66s -> 10059.02s]  That's fine. I'm okay with that.
[10082.71s -> 10105.05s]  I'm landing on you. Panic jump. It was right on the edge. I thought, why would you jump? I just
[10105.05s -> 10109.05s]  thought I was, I don't know. I don't know. That's why I need a boat flex connected to my fucking
[10109.05s -> 10128.41s]  thumb. Oh man. Oh, it's all over from here. Oh, damn it. I'm so, I keep, you know, okay,
[10129.13s -> 10133.69s]  you don't keep seeing it in your head. Like I just, I saw the last thing and now I got to run
[10133.69s -> 10143.80s]  up that the last one. Oh, I may never see that again. I got so close. And what happened there,
[10143.80s -> 10151.32s]  sir? What was that? I hit my fucking head on the ceiling. Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep,
[10151.80s -> 10192.66s]  I ain't doing that. I don't care. I'm going to do Bianco Cove. Fuck that, man. Let's get him.
[10192.66s -> 10208.74s]  Rage quit? No, I didn't rage quit. I'm still in the game. Get back here. See, that's the part
[10208.74s -> 10216.74s]  of the game that I like. You know, the kid shit. Oh no, ouchies. Like, look out, he's jumping.
[10219.26s -> 10223.34s]  Like Rube Goldberg machine Mario levels. I mean, I'm not into them at the moment.
[10223.90s -> 10263.53s]  Where'd he go? Yep. And you're the expert. This is a telltale game. What is this image?
[10264.90s -> 10317.11s]  Okay, that is just a screen grab of me going like this. That's what I, it's still the worst joke.
[10317.11s -> 10329.30s]  Yeah, I know. I'm completely and totally aware of it. I know it's the worst. Trust me when I say
[10329.30s -> 10362.90s]  I'm very, oh, we have a Yoshi. Where's the pineapple? What is going on? What? Oh, sorry.
[10363.70s -> 10382.15s]  I have autoplay on. Audio jungle. What's it doing? Audio jungle. Audio jungle. Turn it off. It's off.
[10382.15s -> 10402.15s]  I turned it off. I need a pineapple. Anybody got a pineapple around here? We just got a pineapple.
[10402.15s -> 10415.77s]  I need one. Very, very, very, very badly. Put it back on. All right. Let's see what we get
[10415.77s -> 10423.19s]  for autoplay for woosh sound effects. There you go. I can't hear them. So you tell me. I have no idea.
[10437.96s -> 10451.02s]  Pineapple anywhere. So what is this? Red coins? Nah, I'm fucked this. I'm out of here.
[10455.70s -> 10483.69s]  All right. Wait a minute. I want to, let me, I'm going to go back to this town here. This place.
[10508.76s -> 10515.10s]  I don't know. I can't hear any of these. I can just see that they're titled. The runaway Ferris wheel.
[10528.84s -> 10550.66s]  Turbo stop. It went to a political podcast. This thing's going too fast. It's going way too fast.
[10553.64s -> 10579.74s]  This is too fast. Why are these? This is called bad joke. Bad joke. It knows. It knows. It's self-aware.
[10583.14s -> 10597.19s]  I just can see the titles. I don't even know what's playing. We're going to get so many of these.
[10597.59s -> 10604.81s]  I just water just hit me in the mouth. How I just spit in the air. I spit in the fucking air and it
[10604.81s -> 10612.28s]  landed back in my mouth. That's what happened. That's it. That just happened. There's no water
[10612.28s -> 10640.70s]  in the air. Las Vegas missed one. All right. We're going to get up to the, uh, the teacups
[10640.70s -> 10658.44s]  or whatever the hell it is. There we go. All right. Up to the teacups. Oh, pineapple. All right.
[10658.44s -> 10663.05s]  That's where the pineapple is. Remember that. Remember where the pineapple is.
[10663.61s -> 10683.59s]  Dude, we're getting fucked up here. Where are those? Where are the teacups?
[10689.40s -> 10693.69s]  I just dropped my fucking Wemo.
[10705.03s -> 10709.91s]  That one was intentional. I got that one. I got, I got that one in the bag. I got that one in the
[10709.91s -> 10726.09s]  bag. All right. What do I do? How do I stop this? How do I stop this? Oh, there's a guy down there.
[10726.09s -> 10731.11s]  Oh, no one can ride the first wheel. This is so lame. When is it going to be fixed?
[10731.67s -> 10738.94s]  As you can see, it just spins and spins and spins. Sorry, but this ride is not working well at the
[10738.94s -> 10743.05s]  moment. Well,
[10753.98s -> 10762.47s]  Did I get hit by this? There's a turtle up here.
[10769.11s -> 10772.47s]  And they had to hire a new one.
[10778.97s -> 10782.89s]  I have to jump over the, I can't, can I not just, can I seriously not grab this?
[10784.01s -> 10792.49s]  I have to be able to touch it, right? 20 minutes later. Six hours later. Several bad puns later.
[10792.49s -> 10797.54s]  One hour later. Two hours later. Three hours later.
[10801.86s -> 10833.14s]  I gotta go the other way.
[10843.02s -> 10851.32s]  Okay, turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off.
[10851.32s -> 10867.08s]  Turn it off. Turn it off. What? Or what happened?
[10871.08s -> 10871.58s]  Okay.
[10871.58s -> 10874.08s]  You

[10881.64s -> 10884.68s]  Yeah, it's what I could shake my keys in the camera, too
[10884.84s -> 10899.90s]  You want me to shake my fucking keys into the webcam? All right, I gotta go. I'm gonna go all the way around
[10914.04s -> 10926.12s]  It's all me it's all me
[10935.51s -> 10938.65s]  Okay, I can't I'm not playing this

[12408.50s -> 12413.33s]  I was getting screamed at I was going the other way. I was gonna climb up
[12413.69s -> 12427.17s]  All right, that I'm just going the other way. How the fuck did that happen? I don't understand. I

[12630.67s -> 12638.45s]  Well, that would mean I probably need to come over here with an orange Yoshi

[12735.90s -> 12743.88s]  When I see a Yoshi egg in here somewhere
[12745.04s -> 12760.39s]  At the very beginning is it at least I killed that guy and I'm both
[12760.99s -> 12775.24s]  No, it's definitely no. I can't go back. What about around the water?
[12775.40s -> 12776.60s]  Oh

[12849.74s -> 12857.75s]  No keys, you're not getting them now. I have to run around like a dickhead and look for this one fruit on this whole map
[12858.27s -> 12881.40s]  It's in here in this pool or something. No, that's a banana
[12882.18s -> 12890.38s]  That's in a really weird place
[12890.90s -> 12902.77s]  I thought I would not have come here. We're gonna make you orange. You are orange already. Let's go
[12903.61s -> 12930.89s]  He didn't die from the other water. That was shallow. What now I need I know what that is
[12930.89s -> 12933.29s]  So if it's all water, why can he stand in the pools?
[12934.25s -> 12939.05s]  I mean, that's not shallow. It goes up to my fucking knees as Mario and he's like three and a half feet tall
[12939.73s -> 12947.47s]  Where's this fruit? It was like on this tree
[12947.99s -> 12971.24s]  Okay

[12984.90s -> 12996.00s]  Nice pink. This is great. How do I make it? I could eat that
[12996.52s -> 13000.49s]  All right, you're now orange
[13000.85s -> 13004.16s]  Please don't go over there. Don't go over there. Watch out
[13005.24s -> 13025.72s]  It's knee-deep water Yoshi. Don't go over there. He's made out of cotton candy
[13043.52s -> 13046.72s]  Yeah, okay
[13046.96s -> 13058.99s]  Doesn't matter doesn't matter which one I start on does it probably not it's just Frogger. Is it Frogger? It is Frogger, isn't it?

[13127.05s -> 13142.95s]  I'm never gonna be able to do any of these fucking the depth perception. Just keep the camera here at all times
[13142.95s -> 13147.66s]  Don't ever move it. There's no reason to ever move the camera from here like fucking Diablo
[13148.14s -> 13156.44s]  I'm in trouble. Oh my no, no, no, I

[13376.63s -> 13378.63s]  You don't have to go that fast
[13378.63s -> 13384.11s]  I gotta go as fast as I can but it don't drop right now. Oh, I'm so bad at fucking video games of Mario, especially
[13385.11s -> 13387.11s]  If my patience is out of a fucking goddamn
[13387.83s -> 13391.51s]  Love weasel, you know what I mean? Like if I'm gonna I'm just gonna come trying to steal your eggs
[13392.35s -> 13421.29s]  And even if there's like 40 spiders in there, I'm just going to do eggs. I idiot why why why guys?
[13421.29s -> 13423.43s]  Um, I fell I didn't fall
[13424.72s -> 13431.48s]  Okay, so I don't understand what the fuck I'm doing. Oh, I know what it was. Sorry. Sometimes I forget
[13432.00s -> 13436.20s]  people holding their foot down on the gas till it hits the bottom of their car and
[13437.68s -> 13441.48s]  Flying by at 90 miles per hour. It's a little distracting
[13442.28s -> 13443.68s]  Sometimes I forget
[13443.68s -> 13451.06s]  Sorry, like pushing your gas down until you you hit the bottom of the car. Oh
[13453.74s -> 13475.84s]  Safe I did this the first time and now I'm so anxious. I can't fucking do it again
[13476.52s -> 13494.68s]  Every time what am I doing? That's so wrong. It's gotta be a side flip. I didn't do a side flip first time. I did it
[13495.16s -> 13519.34s]  Hey, okay
[13519.66s -> 13524.04s]  You fucking weirdo. It's time for you to stop being such a weirdo and do this
[13524.66s -> 13536.60s]  You fucking weirdo. Oh my god
[13537.78s -> 13549.81s]  So misleading long jump that doesn't exist in Mario Sunshine. They deleted it from the game
[13555.44s -> 13576.50s]  Shit your diaper. Hurry up. That's the blue button to leap
[13577.02s -> 13581.52s]  What that's not true. Is that a lie?
[13582.18s -> 13585.09s]  They like wait, is that a lie? That's not a lie Z
[13585.77s -> 13598.93s]  That's not Z. Is it? No, it's not. No, you got to just go right at the top. I gotta count. Here we go
[13598.93s -> 13600.93s]  I'm gonna count ready
[13601.93s -> 13603.93s]  One one two
[13604.45s -> 13642.34s]  Three it takes like three full seconds to get to the top. Here we go. Fucking weirdo. Don't worry. That wasn't embarrassing Jeremy
[13642.52s -> 13651.29s]  It's a don't it's okay. I had a diaper full of slime like three months ago. It's alright
[13651.29s -> 13653.33s]  I think I'll be fine
[13653.33s -> 13674.44s]  Five months whatever it was shadow Mario in the park. This one's kind of just for free isn't it?
[13688.61s -> 13700.63s]  Here he comes. Have you ever grown a beard? I physically can't do it. I don't have enough hair
[13701.27s -> 13707.80s]  That makes any sense. I don't have enough hair. It grows out like straw
[13708.68s -> 13739.07s]  Darn it. I'll remember this
[13739.19s -> 13744.54s]  No, I can kind of grow but it's blonde
[13745.30s -> 13746.62s]  so
[13746.62s -> 13754.15s]  Like here look, I'll show you but for instance, I'm gonna get I'm getting a little close just let you know. Let's see
[13755.15s -> 13760.71s]  It's all the black there's tons of blonde hair in here that you can't really see
[13762.15s -> 13764.15s]  so like
[13764.71s -> 13768.43s]  It looks weird because there's a ton of blonde hair in there
[13771.75s -> 13773.75s]  It's like black and blonde
[13786.17s -> 13789.05s]  You
[13789.05s -> 13794.12s]  Is weird is weird and even if I do grow this out it looks like
[13797.58s -> 13802.50s]  It just it doesn't look it's not you don't want it like I don't want it on my face
[13802.50s -> 13804.50s]  I like having a little bit
[13804.86s -> 13811.10s]  Maybe after a few days of shaving. I think it looks okay. But once you go four or five six days after shaving I
[13811.70s -> 13815.34s]  Look like I look like a fucking mutant or something. I look horrible
[13815.94s -> 13828.00s]  Okay, what what's left what's left in this video game only three at the Sienna
[13829.12s -> 13831.12s]  Serena Beach

[13860.09s -> 13870.24s]  I'm gonna go to the beach. This one is the one with the house, right or I could go to the harbor
[13870.24s -> 13873.90s]  Yeah, I'm gonna go to Rico Harbor. It's two or three there that I can get
[13874.42s -> 13878.84s]  Well, I haven't been there in a long time. I don't remember where the hell it is
[13879.36s -> 13892.21s]  This one right here
[13896.99s -> 13898.11s]  No
[13898.11s -> 13900.41s]  Which one is this one?
[13901.09s -> 13917.44s]  Where's that coin pop up? Oh, okay. I've 54 coins
[13918.20s -> 13939.66s]  What do I spend these in the hut? I hear a star

[13947.60s -> 13969.94s]  All right, you got it, right? I got 55 of these things. All right to go to the hut
[13973.78s -> 13976.34s]  Like the marketplace is there somebody at the market or something?
[13982.05s -> 13984.94s]  boathouse
[13984.94s -> 13991.79s]  across from the cannon across from the cannon across from the cannon
[13992.39s -> 14004.25s]  Down here and over there over here. It was in wait in front of me
[14005.29s -> 14009.00s]  In front like what like in right in front of me?
[14009.72s -> 14014.08s]  Literally like literally right in front of me turn around I
[14015.08s -> 14016.48s]  dig right here
[14016.48s -> 14019.09s]  Like this guy
[14019.09s -> 14022.63s]  wrong
[14022.63s -> 14024.47s]  spot with the M
[14024.47s -> 14038.00s]  Behind you am I getting fucked with right now people about people
[14038.44s -> 14041.38s]  There's people trying to tell me where to go and the people telling me the wrong way, right?
[14042.16s -> 14047.12s]  Look to the left
[14047.12s -> 14050.32s]  This is so much information flooding the chat right now
[14051.00s -> 14054.25s]  Rico Harbor building now. It's on the pier
[14056.84s -> 14058.16s]  Right here
[14058.16s -> 14062.38s]  Well, you can even you can go in this building
[14068.84s -> 14069.96s]  Okay
[14069.96s -> 14073.76s]  It's up my ass and around the corner
[14073.76s -> 14076.96s]  See when people say suit like that and that's like what I see and then I see left
[14077.48s -> 14082.46s]  Remember that there's a stream delay where you're getting what I do
[14083.00s -> 14085.56s]  Five to eight seconds after I do it
[14085.56s -> 14088.80s]  So when I turn left to look left and you say left
[14088.80s -> 14091.00s]  I did that five and a half six six seconds ago
[14091.00s -> 14093.24s]  And then by the time you say it's right in front of you
[14093.52s -> 14097.16s]  I'm actually looking at where the boat was because if five seconds have to go by
[14099.04s -> 14101.04s]  Wait ten blue coins
[14101.28s -> 14104.23s]  Let's go five shines
[14105.35s -> 14116.11s]  I've been hoarding these. Yeah, let's go. No refunds. Wait, should I not do this? It's two seconds ready?
[14116.11s -> 14119.52s]  I wonder if I'm going to say one right now
[14120.12s -> 14132.12s]  Six seconds. That was six seconds before I saw one in chat ready. Let's do it again on camera. So ready?
[14132.12s -> 14134.12s]  I want you to say
[14134.40s -> 14137.36s]  I'm gonna say a word and you have to say the second you see my mouth moving
[14138.04s -> 14146.05s]  point six seconds
[14146.05s -> 14164.04s]  That was five point like eight seconds time it on stream. How would I do that?
[14166.60s -> 14172.30s]  47 stars
[14178.79s -> 14180.79s]  Congratulations, they do nothing
[14181.99s -> 14185.15s]  Pull up a clock that how is that gonna do anything?
[14185.83s -> 14193.48s]  It's whatever you see I could have a clock that's counting down and you would get the countdown five seconds after I start the countdown
[14193.92s -> 14210.48s]  Put chat on screen. I
[14211.16s -> 14214.16s]  That's I don't know. I'm busy
[14214.76s -> 14225.26s]  Red coins in the water at Rico Harbor. All right, I'd rage quit this one. I'm back
[14225.26s -> 14255.25s]  I have to get perfect timing here ready. Nope. I like caravans of red ones. Okay. We're good. Okay
[14255.25s -> 14256.73s]  I'm back. We're gonna get it
[14256.73s -> 14280.28s]  Holy shit. This thing is hard to control. I got time but damn this is okay. This is hard
[14280.28s -> 14282.08s]  This is very hard to control
[14282.12s -> 14298.83s]  Use the middle squid
[14298.83s -> 14301.79s]  Wait, I thought I was getting I wasn't getting lied to yesterday
[14302.23s -> 14310.30s]  So I have people who actually you really were going faster or slower
[14311.06s -> 14321.16s]  Holy fuck. I thought everyone was just making that up. I thought people were just making that up
[14321.88s -> 14326.76s]  Yeah, I could ever tell I could ever tell who knows who knows what's what's accurate and wasn't accurate
[14326.76s -> 14330.04s]  I don't know. I could I could be you guys could just messing with me. Oh
[14365.94s -> 14382.16s]  Okay, we're holy shit. How am I still alive?

[14388.40s -> 14394.60s]  This is a great music video you're making but I would appreciate if I could get a better view of the of the game
[14418.65s -> 14420.73s]  Guaranteed you will not finish this level. Oh, yeah
[14421.25s -> 14428.00s]  Guthrie one three three seven write that name down. They're getting this up like in a few months if I feel like it
[14447.99s -> 14495.02s]  Guaranteed follow the yellow brick road. Where's six? There's one in the air somewhere. Where is it?
[14495.38s -> 14501.23s]  Right there. There's one in the air right here. I got a minute. I have a full minute guys. It'll be alright. I
[14505.67s -> 14510.37s]  Swear to okay. It's almost like it's almost like this like an evil part of my brain that
[14510.87s -> 14515.64s]  Magnetizes me to do stupid things like I it's like hubris. You know what I mean?
[14516.00s -> 14521.00s]  It's like I'm magnetized to screw something up because I just told you that I was doing fine
[14529.70s -> 14534.29s]  evil shadow
[14534.29s -> 14536.09s]  audios desync
[14536.09s -> 14555.19s]  Like I just need to stop talking about how things I'm doing are going
[14555.83s -> 14564.36s]  Like when I'm cooking this hamburger sure does look like it's medium rare medium. Well, well
[14565.28s -> 14570.96s]  Why is there a fire here now? Well, I burnt it. I burnt it. What's that smell stink smells like smoke. Oh

[14600.14s -> 14611.68s]  I could probably do open heart surgery on myself if I just didn't say that
[14611.76s -> 14613.76s]  It's just going pretty well. Oh
[14650.55s -> 14653.79s]  My god, it's so hard to determine where that fucking coin is
[14667.52s -> 14685.14s]  Guarantee, you won't beat this Mario's made it at Dippin Dots. That'd be like kind of cool
[14685.62s -> 14702.86s]  Is it like let me guess the eighth coin is like hidden somewhere in a stupid place
[14703.62s -> 14783.88s]  Going this way. I'm not missing it. There's the last point. Let him suffer
[14785.20s -> 14802.14s]  That's so mean. It's going too fast. This is going too fast

[15621.06s -> 15627.62s]  I thought it was rotating. I thought it was moving up. Oh

[16062.16s -> 16069.20s]  I'm not gonna just I'm not gonna say if I don't be saying the word. This is gonna dump gasoline on the spark
[16069.84s -> 16071.72s]  Hey
[16071.72s -> 16083.82s]  We gotta go down
[16083.86s -> 16088.43s]  Yeah, we have to go down the bowling lane. I always wondered what the fuck was back there
[16088.43s -> 16090.43s]  You know, I mean, you know when you break to something newer
[16091.23s -> 16092.31s]  your
[16092.31s -> 16094.31s]  Your bowling lane that doesn't work
[16094.79s -> 16099.75s]  Like it's like, oh, I just think not working that guy goes all the way in the back where the pins are
[16100.47s -> 16103.68s]  It's like holy wait, what's back there? Oh
[16104.88s -> 16108.41s]  Nevermind, but you kind of want to see what's back here
[16122.92s -> 16127.56s]  Kill these guys or I'm an M right there
[16129.83s -> 16141.78s]  Killed them all I don't need to
[16147.48s -> 16178.12s]  Elevator take me back down talk to that guy. I can't seem to attack these motherfuckers. I'm just gonna talk to this guy. Oh
[16178.88s -> 16202.29s]  Okay
[16202.77s -> 16217.36s]  King boo is a slot machine boss. All right. Well, this is cool. This is awesome
[16218.56s -> 16229.03s]  Then it what have we got? You didn't get shit boo. Sorry, just stop it for spinning
[16229.67s -> 16247.56s]  Well, I guess now I get a turn
[16266.92s -> 16270.86s]  This guy's fucked. So I help this guy
[16271.48s -> 16294.95s]  Alright, we're good. I don't need to be lining this up with anything. Do I?
[16301.35s -> 16309.92s]  pineapples pineapples pineapples
[16310.16s -> 16317.08s]  Ineffective. It's just laughing at you. You sure
[16317.60s -> 16357.63s]  It's like sweating. Oh, what about this one? He seems to dislike spicy things. Now's your chance
[16358.15s -> 16368.52s]  My chance to jump on his I just put him out. I think I just put him out
[16369.08s -> 16375.60s]  Just helped him. I sprayed him with water. Yeah
[16376.24s -> 16378.24s]  Yeah, he's I've helped him
[16378.72s -> 16380.00s]  All right
[16380.00s -> 16405.28s]  Spin it again. Is that nothing? He's a big waters, too
[16405.76s -> 16422.47s]  Spin it. All right hot pepper. Stop this for spinning and then go what behind him pull on his tail
[16437.24s -> 16439.24s]  Throw another one at him
[16439.24s -> 16444.14s]  Throw more fruit at him, I guess
[16445.18s -> 16456.88s]  Well, how all right, how would it change if I throw a fruit at him and he goes?
[16456.88s -> 16460.96s]  Oh, that isn't effective. But when he eats hot peppers all of a sudden now it hurts him
[16461.60s -> 16495.79s]  What kill these guys? Are you waiting for them to die fruits? All right, here we go
[16495.99s -> 16500.43s]  But what's the point do I need to stop this shit? It's just kind of annoying. What's the point of stopping it?
[16501.31s -> 16506.75s]  All right, we're gonna go up here and then I'm gonna throw this at him
[16507.83s -> 16534.81s]  Yes, sure. Let's go. I thought I just got thrown out
[16535.45s -> 16544.22s]  Yeah, I kicked out of the casino. I'm currently stun locked
[16544.94s -> 16586.16s]  This is how it ends. I need coins
[16587.00s -> 16590.30s]  Hey, look at that
[16590.30s -> 16594.20s]  Thanks for the coins
[16594.20s -> 16596.44s]  swell swell swell
[16597.32s -> 16614.99s]  He's turning down the audio a little loud. All right, he's dead
[16623.20s -> 16624.00s]  uh
[16624.00s -> 16638.30s]  Anus music
[16638.30s -> 16672.92s]  He said it because I only have one frame of reference for this so that leaves us with
[16674.44s -> 16685.80s]  There's more in here. What about that six scrubbing sirena beach
[16691.15s -> 16694.30s]  Not this again
[16694.30s -> 16700.49s]  Didn't I already do this?
[16700.49s -> 16704.33s]  Mario we got trouble that electric group is back where everywhere
[16706.54s -> 16709.44s]  Uh, oh by the way, you have three minutes
[16712.73s -> 16750.99s]  For what
[16750.99s -> 16859.68s]  You have to get everything or just like 80% or something throw barrels. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop
[16859.76s -> 16883.16s]  Whoa, what what what? All right. All right. What the hell? Where's my star many? Thanks friend. Oh shit
[16889.39s -> 16902.75s]  Many thanks. You saved me two free coins. Are there people down here? Wait, can I get two more coins?
[16922.62s -> 16924.06s]  Thanks mario
[16924.06s -> 16930.27s]  Yeah, nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice
[16932.40s -> 16934.88s]  The easiest four blue coins i've ever gotten in this whole game
[16935.60s -> 16950.22s]  All right, where's the guy that owns this place?
[16950.22s -> 16977.07s]  Where's the owner? That was great. Now. Here's a shine just for you
[16993.23s -> 17006.48s]  52 shines and counting and going right back in game fucking sucks last night
[17008.44s -> 17011.08s]  No, that doesn't work here. That doesn't work here. That doesn't work here
[17022.84s -> 17025.66s]  Shadow mario checks in
[17025.66s -> 17038.09s]  So episode seven is shadow mario every time it seems right makes sense. I guess
[17038.81s -> 17052.62s]  Go get him. I'll never believe it. We oh, this is gonna be an annoying chase, isn't it?
[17055.53s -> 17058.81s]  Get in there. Oh, he's gonna be going through weird doors and through ceilings and
[17059.93s -> 17061.61s]  All right. Let's go
[17061.61s -> 17074.91s]  Do that on purpose. Oh wait
[17077.63s -> 17079.23s]  They are they are fake
[17079.23s -> 17081.77s]  Which one's real?
[17081.77s -> 17129.56s]  Why is it not hitting him? Are you a little?
[17132.01s -> 17158.09s]  Yeah, I got you gonna die in the shadow mario level. Nope. He's still alive. Anybody else see the
[17158.97s -> 17164.51s]  other mario
[17164.51s -> 17171.28s]  Thought I did
[17171.28s -> 17175.47s]  All right. I think we have seven in most of these places
[17176.72s -> 17177.68s]  seven
[17177.68s -> 17179.32s]  seven
[17179.32s -> 17181.08s]  seven
[17181.08s -> 17183.00s]  nine
[17183.00s -> 17186.38s]  seven eight
[17186.38s -> 17188.43s]  two
[17188.43s -> 17197.26s]  Two and okay, that's the other pipe. So I gotta go
[17200.12s -> 17204.49s]  It's up there. Okay. I need the rocket. Give me the rocket. Can you throw it up here to me, please?
[17204.57s -> 17208.03s]  Just throw me the rocket toss it to me. I'll catch it. I swear to god. I'll catch it
[17209.39s -> 17212.59s]  No, dude, I don't want to throw your phone that far. I'll catch it. Just fucking throw it
[17212.99s -> 17217.23s]  Oh god, can I just hand it to you? I'm just gonna walk over to you and hand it to you. Just throw it dude god
[17217.95s -> 17235.20s]  Okay here one two three, please don't break. What are these guys doing over here? Are you slacking off?
[17235.85s -> 17248.96s]  You're slacking off. What happened to the phone? Uh, it tumbled down the stairs
[17249.52s -> 17263.02s]  Is there a case on it? No
[17263.42s -> 17264.94s]  Dummy, right?
[17264.94s -> 17284.38s]  All right. Let's go get the here. Here we go. What the hell is
[17287.53s -> 17289.53s]  This weird like picnic basket flag is this
[17308.88s -> 17313.50s]  Oh, right. I forgot about this. I was like, yeah, i'll come back here. Fuck this
[17314.38s -> 17317.29s]  I gotta go under and then up. All right
[17339.31s -> 17346.91s]  Hoopy oh
[17356.30s -> 17372.36s]  I remember I was like, why is it moving? Why why why is it moving man? What's going on? Why is it moving?
[17373.61s -> 17377.05s]  Wait, I was supposed to press jump. I was supposed to jump. Oh fuck. Oh, no. I'll come back later
[17377.77s -> 17386.78s]  Get out of the way. Hey
[17386.78s -> 17388.54s]  Don't look at me
[17388.54s -> 17393.96s]  Leave me alone
[17393.96s -> 17395.96s]  Get out of here. Stop
[17396.44s -> 17403.64s]  Oh, what the heck i'm gonna come back later
[17412.88s -> 17425.18s]  Dear what the fuck am I right now? It's the wrong. No, this is the only thing I can do
[17432.78s -> 17435.42s]  Okay, can I rely I can walk on here
[17437.69s -> 17439.69s]  The goal is up there, right?
[17464.56s -> 17466.56s]  Should I just shimmy and
[17466.56s -> 17476.51s]  This feels incorrect
[17476.51s -> 17479.31s]  Oh, okay that you went over the fucking banister mario
[17479.95s -> 17492.81s]  This is definitely the wrong place
[17518.49s -> 17552.67s]  Easy easy easy
[17552.75s -> 17567.98s]  What dammit calm down? I that was a good guy like
[17568.92s -> 17571.32s]  David or cheese just struck out in the bottom of the ninth inning
[17572.12s -> 17577.88s]  Game four of the 2004 fucking alcs. You know what I mean? That was what that was. That was what that sound was
[17583.69s -> 17601.72s]  That was like an old man screaming at the tv mad because there was a strikeout a plus b is a long dive jump
[17611.79s -> 17612.91s]  and
[17612.91s -> 17614.44s]  Why?
[17614.44s -> 17616.44s]  Why did that why was I never told?
[17619.02s -> 17624.22s]  Why is why it's been 16 17 hours in the game, why don't you know this
[17630.11s -> 17633.39s]  Because it was funnier. What do you mean? It was funnier, but
[17634.11s -> 17646.27s]  It looks big as fuck today
[17646.51s -> 17662.57s]  Okay, that was fucking stupid
[17663.13s -> 17666.01s]  It bumped into me. I jumped up. I didn't press any buttons
[17666.33s -> 17695.58s]  The thing when when it swayed back to start to fall bumped me and knocked me up turn the
[17696.06s -> 17746.00s]  It's gallding right now to the police station. I don't know what that is now. I can run through the doors
[17746.56s -> 17760.73s]  We do this first here, but it's all gonna be okay
[17764.40s -> 17767.68s]  I only have one health for one life. Whatever
[17768.88s -> 17778.38s]  Okay, where am I?
[17778.38s -> 17779.34s]  um
[17779.34s -> 17785.23s]  Is safe. Holy shit it is
[17800.81s -> 17806.16s]  I tried using the new jump and it didn't work out for me
[17807.18s -> 17826.24s]  unfortunately
[17826.24s -> 17829.07s]  spin jump and dive
[17829.07s -> 17835.79s]  The problem with me though is reliably spinning the analog to like do that. I could just I you know me
[17835.79s -> 17837.79s]  I might just walk the fuck off the cliff
[17839.12s -> 17849.10s]  Wait
[17849.10s -> 17852.41s]  Okay
[17852.41s -> 17853.85s]  Why am I still alive?
[17853.85s -> 17862.00s]  That doesn't save very much time
[17862.00s -> 17866.40s]  You have to show you you have to spin jump every time there. You can't just regular jump or dive or anything
[17866.80s -> 17877.44s]  You have to actually spin jump on every mushroom. I'm kind of glad that happened because I only have three
[17878.00s -> 17880.00s]  I have one
[17880.08s -> 17900.17s]  One up, you know what I mean?
[17901.45s -> 17902.73s]  Mm-hmm
[17902.73s -> 17913.98s]  What's the downside of the game over? I'm just having to run all the way back here. I'd rather be able just to start over again
[17922.20s -> 17924.68s]  All right. Oh same strategy. I'm doing that again
[17929.74s -> 17931.74s]  It didn't have enough momentum that time
[17931.74s -> 17936.68s]  So we're not gonna do that strategy again. We're gonna just do it the normal way. I didn't have enough momentum
[17974.33s -> 17976.33s]  All right, here we go
[17976.33s -> 17980.17s]  These are cool to have on the level like have those on the level. They serve a purpose
[18001.42s -> 18010.52s]  um
[18010.52s -> 18014.28s]  I did it. I just I spin jumped. Uh
[18018.65s -> 18023.61s]  I'm going the wrong way. How am I supposed to know what the way I i've never played this game before
[18025.58s -> 18035.47s]  Are they like five different holes? I don't I don't know how am I supposed to know that?
[18036.35s -> 18053.02s]  These are the only ones I can reliably get to right now
[18058.43s -> 18060.43s]  There's one over here and one over there
[18060.43s -> 18067.10s]  Where's the third one?
[18067.10s -> 18069.58s]  This is dangerous. But what is it for blue coin?
[18073.10s -> 18075.74s]  I can I go I can't jump in there. It's right there
[18076.54s -> 18088.01s]  Can I go that way see if I can go all the way around
[18090.27s -> 18091.39s]  All the way
[18091.39s -> 18102.72s]  Now there's one back here
[18105.92s -> 18108.30s]  This is a hole
[18108.30s -> 18110.14s]  right like it
[18110.14s -> 18111.68s]  It's not a hole
[18111.68s -> 18117.95s]  This looks like a hole to me
[18117.95s -> 18119.71s]  No. Oh, there it is
[18119.71s -> 18134.09s]  I can also go back here
[18134.09s -> 18138.40s]  Well, i'll try this one
[18138.40s -> 18140.00s]  Where does this bring me?
[18140.00s -> 18153.05s]  Please leave me alone
[18157.47s -> 18159.47s]  You two are fucking with me right now. Just
[18159.71s -> 18161.15s]  Look some other way
[18161.15s -> 18176.24s]  Get away from me. Get away from me. Get away from me. Get away from me and then
[18179.32s -> 18181.32s]  Oh Jesus, what the fuck?
[18198.30s -> 18200.30s]  Which way is he going?
[18208.19s -> 18210.03s]  Holy shit, he's right behind me
[18210.03s -> 18217.23s]  Okay now
[18217.23s -> 18225.02s]  This is what do I do?
[18225.02s -> 18226.70s]  I just had to walk
[18226.70s -> 18228.70s]  The wind shit is gonna be over here, isn't it?
[18229.84s -> 18231.84s]  I didn't know there's gonna be a springboard
[18232.08s -> 18234.48s]  Do you see how fucking much I jumped off that?
[18235.12s -> 18237.12s]  That was like a boing
[18238.16s -> 18253.31s]  I don't care about that
[18253.31s -> 18255.31s]  I can just make this as a jump, right?
[18255.47s -> 18256.91s]  I of course I can
[18256.91s -> 18275.60s]  Is this a spring? Is this a spring?
[18298.94s -> 18301.02s]  Oh god. Oh man. This is
[18306.43s -> 18309.31s]  No, no, is this not is that not this? This is not a tight rope
[18309.87s -> 18317.05s]  Oh, why can I?
[18317.05s -> 18325.31s]  Okay. Thank you
[18325.87s -> 18327.87s]  The camera
[18339.48s -> 18344.68s]  This place sucks
[18344.68s -> 18346.68s]  I'm trying to like point dive
[18361.53s -> 18365.45s]  No, I don't want to do that again. I had to juke like four people
[18367.82s -> 18369.90s]  Do the speedrun skip? I'm going for it
[18369.98s -> 18373.90s]  I'm gonna go for that because that's the only way I ever liably know my brain will try to do this
[18374.22s -> 18376.22s]  I'm going for the speedrun strategy. You ready?
[18377.32s -> 18379.08s]  Check this shit out
[18379.08s -> 18387.71s]  Which way was that?
[18387.71s -> 18393.58s]  Hey, remember which way was that? This way?
[18395.29s -> 18399.05s]  I'm going for it. I'm getting up there. I ain't going the real fucked up way. No way
[18399.85s -> 18432.24s]  I'm going for it. I'm gonna get this shit
[18434.32s -> 18435.60s]  Check this out
[18435.60s -> 18439.82s]  You'll be reading about me in fucking newspapers after this one
[18444.20s -> 18446.60s]  I I he went over the edge. Oh my
[18447.32s -> 18448.68s]  I
[18449.45s -> 18454.01s]  I he he decided to to parkour over the edge instead of just
[18454.81s -> 18457.69s]  getting
[18457.69s -> 18459.69s]  I'm doing i'm gonna be able to do it that way
[18460.01s -> 18465.69s]  But um, he just sometimes decides that he's going to jump over and across instead of just grab
[18466.09s -> 18470.57s]  He just sometimes is like maria's like, you know, I feel like pole vaulting over whatever thing you're is in front of me
[18470.81s -> 18499.24s]  I'm just gonna jump the fuck over it. Yeah, you'll be reading about me
[18522.86s -> 18524.48s]  I will say though
[18524.48s -> 18528.73s]  They were so scared to have this game be just the cleaning game
[18530.36s -> 18531.80s]  They were like, oh my god
[18531.80s -> 18535.96s]  No, we have to get rid of that thing and they have to do shit like this for like at least 20 levels
[18580.80s -> 18599.52s]  Get over them barrio you motherfucker open up your fucking books and get the video game history streamers

[18662.41s -> 18663.53s]  Is that it?
[18663.53s -> 18684.99s]  Now anytime you watch a streamer play this game and they get to this part and they go holy shit
[18685.47s -> 18687.47s]  Um, this I hate this
[18687.80s -> 18693.56s]  Tell them to use the fucking germa 985 dive technique and they show them a youtube video jump clip of this
[18694.36s -> 18696.52s]  And they'll be like wow. Okay, that's so much easier

[18767.10s -> 18769.10s]  There's no problem. But of course

[19304.19s -> 19314.41s]  I just saw a a big blue diamond thing show up. That's five thousand bits
[19318.19s -> 19321.07s]  That's fifty dollars. You guys you guys have been doing
[19321.79s -> 19324.19s]  The last two days has been like money central
[19328.67s -> 19330.60s]  And it was goiki
[19330.60s -> 19336.36s]  Goiki thanks for the five thousand bits fifty bucks. Is it better to have pogged and lost or to not never have pogged at all?
[19338.04s -> 19343.85s]  um
[19343.85s -> 19345.93s]  That's better to have pogged and lost. Absolutely
[19352.38s -> 19354.54s]  Even as old folks are starting to get excited about this
[19355.18s -> 19359.98s]  Oh before I forget I am not the mayor if you're looking for him. He's probably by that yellow mushroom
[19361.02s -> 19363.58s]  All right, so I need a yellow. Uh, I don't know what if they are like a
[19364.62s -> 19382.03s]  Papaya, what is it?
[19382.03s -> 19387.84s]  Is that you know the mayor looking for a papaya?
[19392.49s -> 19394.17s]  those of you that are uh
[19394.17s -> 19400.65s]  Those of you that have been around the channel for a while, you know that papaya is a b uh c tier
[19401.55s -> 19403.07s]  fruit according to me
[19403.07s -> 19406.44s]  Mom, it feels like it's getting close to fluff festival time
[19407.48s -> 19422.12s]  With papaya, where is it?
[19423.72s -> 19425.32s]  Your c tier
[19425.32s -> 19428.73s]  Yeah
[19428.73s -> 19435.10s]  You think so?
[19435.10s -> 19436.64s]  I'll have you know
[19436.64s -> 19438.64s]  That I have i'm a b plus
[19438.96s -> 19441.26s]  it's according to all the
[19441.58s -> 19443.58s]  data collection places
[19444.54s -> 19446.54s]  stream stats
[19447.07s -> 19449.07s]  I I have a b plus
[19449.39s -> 19451.39s]  in for best streamer of the year
[19455.71s -> 19457.71s]  Did it go down to a b minus? It's still fine
[19464.06s -> 19474.17s]  Why did I do all that for?
[19478.33s -> 19482.65s]  I just love going to find one fruit to bring back to give the yoshi egg
[19497.08s -> 19509.12s]  Give me this fucking thing. You could be a plus if you streamed as bugleberry. I don't think that's true
[19510.00s -> 19519.13s]  Okay, so this is secret now
[19519.61s -> 19530.86s]  What is it? What am I looking for?
[19530.86s -> 19532.86s]  Something I shouldn't wear. What if I go with the yoshi? No
[19534.01s -> 19536.09s]  mushrooms
[19536.09s -> 19537.85s]  All right. Okay. So
[19537.85s -> 19543.05s]  I gotta go down does it matter probably go down the hole that yeah, i'm gonna go down the hole that I went down before
[19544.24s -> 19556.72s]  This one, right?
[19556.72s -> 19574.35s]  Uh, okay
[19574.35s -> 19576.75s]  This music is kind of really loud
[19577.47s -> 19588.84s]  It's just playing the same loop over and over again
[19589.56s -> 19617.79s]  I found it
[19617.79s -> 19620.33s]  Yoshi, are you all right?
[19620.33s -> 19640.30s]  Yoshi
[19640.30s -> 19643.92s]  Oh, uh
[19643.92s -> 19655.00s]  I I didn't know what the fuck that was another one of these goddamn things. I'm gonna
[19655.40s -> 19659.00s]  Oh, that's gonna be look at how look at how much there is
[19659.88s -> 19664.41s]  Why are there people here?
[19664.89s -> 19667.45s]  I'm a chuckster
[19667.45s -> 19672.33s]  You better be careful when speaking to powerful the yontas some will chuck you straight up
[19672.33s -> 19677.29s]  But most chuck you backwards when it comes to tossing folk. I'm well, i'm a chuckster
[19678.01s -> 19692.68s]  I'm a chuckster
[19692.68s -> 19694.44s]  I'm a chuckster
[19694.44s -> 19698.49s]  He almost threw me off
[19698.49s -> 19705.98s]  Rick, are you a chuckster?
[19707.98s -> 19709.18s]  Oh
[19709.18s -> 19726.06s]  Okay, this one goes up holy shit
[19738.35s -> 19743.40s]  I like this one. This one's great. This one's this one sucks, but it's I like it
[19752.62s -> 19763.68s]  Wait, can I push them? Hey, throw me over this way
[19779.26s -> 19784.24s]  Um, I don't think how how could you get less accurate than what I just did?
[19785.76s -> 19793.56s]  I think I can influence a little bit
[19797.08s -> 19798.44s]  a little
[19798.44s -> 19816.28s]  Throw me no. No, no. No, can I back up back up? I came out of it at a weird angle
[19816.84s -> 19832.49s]  Hear me. It's a school night. I don't go to school
[19845.61s -> 19849.95s]  Come on, throw me more throw me more further further
[19850.91s -> 19853.93s]  Why are you not hitting this?
[19853.93s -> 19855.93s]  truancy, yeah
[19856.41s -> 19859.21s]  Somebody somebody tell the time to get the truancy on me
[19860.17s -> 19862.17s]  I I haven't been to a class
[19862.49s -> 19884.83s]  In 17 years somebody called the truancy on me. No you because look at the there's a wall there
[19884.83s -> 19914.14s]  Here far I bounced off the rip. Oh my god, whatever
[19915.10s -> 19917.10s]  Thankfully, I can stay here forever
[19917.50s -> 19919.50s]  actually forever and by the way
[19920.16s -> 19922.19s]  Can I just?
[19922.19s -> 19934.46s]  Nope
[19943.37s -> 19945.37s]  Throw me throw me real far
[19950.17s -> 19953.88s]  And go
[19953.88s -> 19958.24s]  Good. I need you all the way. Okay, you now have to be
[19959.88s -> 19962.28s]  I need you all the way in front of me here and I gotta get this right
[19964.86s -> 19969.66s]  Right there is all right. No, it's not good enough. That's good. It's okay. I think so
[19971.58s -> 19978.40s]  higher higher
[19978.40s -> 19982.64s]  He almost threw me to the all right you guys any of you guys ever played little league?
[19984.12s -> 19988.36s]  I used to play little league and we had these there was like two or three fields that were right next to each other
[19989.15s -> 19995.55s]  You'd have the one outfield would be there would be another outfield. It'd be two or three of them right next to each other, right?
[19996.35s -> 19998.35s]  And there was always that kid
[19998.83s -> 20001.15s]  That hit a home run every other at bat
[20002.22s -> 20006.86s]  And sometimes he would hit it over the fence and it would go into the other field
[20007.42s -> 20009.88s]  Even while they were playing a game
[20009.88s -> 20015.08s]  They would do it all it would happen all the fucking time. It would fuck up so many plays because like the big strong
[20015.64s -> 20017.31s]  eighth grader
[20017.31s -> 20020.35s]  Could hit the ball almost to the pitcher's mound on the other field
[20023.55s -> 20025.55s]  That's just so so dangerous
[20051.53s -> 20055.71s]  Now i've sealed my fate, I don't care if we're here all night i'm all right with this
[20059.87s -> 20070.35s]  I don't have a problem with this
[20070.35s -> 20072.72s]  Okay. Now this guy throws
[20073.04s -> 20076.56s]  So hard he throws
[20077.20s -> 20079.20s]  As hard as he can so I have to hold back
[20079.68s -> 20083.96s]  Say good night to me. Good night
[20091.36s -> 20098.22s]  Okay, so now i'm
[20098.22s -> 20100.91s]  Wait, i'm not up there
[20111.29s -> 20116.09s]  Okay, so
[20116.09s -> 20119.53s]  Twist am I going through a fucking portal? What's going? I hope throw me
[20120.57s -> 20128.51s]  Okay, there we go. So when I watch what about these guys?
[20131.32s -> 20136.40s]  Why I don't I don't get this. Why are they all here? Why are you all here? I don't get it. Why are they here?
[20138.25s -> 20140.65s]  Wait, is this just a mess? Just just a mess with you. I get it
[20141.21s -> 20155.90s]  throw
[20155.90s -> 20160.00s]  Um somebody over there
[20162.81s -> 20163.85s]  you
[20163.85s -> 20165.53s]  Which way did you throw?
[20165.53s -> 20172.54s]  Which way is this person's throw?
[20172.54s -> 20174.86s]  Do you definitely throw over there? Right? Is that a
[20175.58s -> 20199.88s]  It's gonna be right on the line right here. All right, come here. That's lined up. I think
[20217.92s -> 20220.96s]  It's gonna be on the other side. Yeah on the other side
[20222.46s -> 20238.17s]  What are you doing? I I don't I don't know I was overthinking that just throw me
[20244.67s -> 20247.07s]  I thought he I had to get thrown to the other side and then
[20256.88s -> 20259.69s]  Paws sick
[20261.02s -> 20268.18s]  Paws me that way, please. Well, he's a chuckster. Yeah, he is a chuckster
[20290.16s -> 20297.96s]  What happened
[20313.07s -> 20317.37s]  He threw you to your death. Ah, I need to get I don't miss this
[20331.12s -> 20331.76s]  Don't rush it
[20331.76s -> 20333.76s]  If I rush it i'm gonna throw off the edge
[20333.76s -> 20346.01s]  The problem I have with that one when he throws your way up high is if I hold back too much
[20346.17s -> 20349.77s]  Then I just go right back down. But if I don't hold it at all or I do it too little
[20351.10s -> 20353.10s]  You really fly
[20353.50s -> 20379.23s]  Come on
[20382.59s -> 20384.59s]  You can control yourself in the air
[20384.91s -> 20385.87s]  I know
[20385.87s -> 20389.39s]  But if I hold if I do back too much, it's it's a really
[20390.27s -> 20393.47s]  There it's a lot of finessing in the air when you can't really see where you are
[20409.08s -> 20413.40s]  Hold forward. I will go over the cross. I will go across the whole map if I hold forward
[20415.00s -> 20422.25s]  And what is this doing this for? Well, has he tilted I was facing straight ahead
[20442.32s -> 20445.28s]  Game sucks streamers sucks. I'm going to bed
[20446.96s -> 20449.58s]  Wait, it can't be both. Okay
[20450.06s -> 20473.29s]  You gotta pick one. You gotta pick one and stick with it. Um
[20483.58s -> 20486.27s]  What why
[20489.07s -> 20492.35s]  Okay, I did this like six times in a row doing the same thing
[20496.00s -> 20498.88s]  And now all of a sudden it's not I did i'm god. I got it wrong
[20517.44s -> 20521.34s]  This I can't get like more straight than this
[20527.00s -> 20565.50s]  But i'm not gonna do it again. I didn't holy shit. That was close. All right, just do it quickly quickly go go go go right here
[20568.27s -> 20592.11s]  Okay, here we go. This is it. I can't tell i'm not ready yet. I'm not ready for this not yet
[20593.29s -> 20596.65s]  I'm not ready for this. Is that no, that's not right. I got a little bit more to the left
[20601.15s -> 20621.84s]  right there
[20621.84s -> 20630.81s]  Line's gonna be right between my legs. I love having a big fucking rectangle in the way
[20631.37s -> 20664.83s]  It was as if I was standing like at a full like 40 to 50 degrees to my right
[20671.39s -> 20674.99s]  I saw I I saw good do it now good now. I agree with you
[20676.59s -> 20678.59s]  I wasn't
[20678.91s -> 20685.39s]  What the fuck there's so many there's only so many pixels that mario's body can turn
[20686.11s -> 20694.06s]  You know what I mean? Like it there's only so much he can finite movements he can make
[20694.78s -> 20710.44s]  There's a whatever. There you go
[20712.46s -> 20714.46s]  These things these things are getting fucking deleted
[20715.18s -> 20730.14s]  On sunday, by the way, you're never gonna see one ever again. This has got me so paranoid that it's not correct
[20767.80s -> 20774.59s]  What the fuck wait, what what the fuck oh my god
[20785.74s -> 20788.11s]  The angle's bad
[20789.87s -> 20805.36s]  It's too far back
[20806.36s -> 20817.18s]  Didn't I go over it
[20817.18s -> 20820.96s]  Where did I fall then?
[20821.20s -> 20838.09s]  I undershot it
[20838.09s -> 20885.93s]  Right. He's gonna push me though if I uh, oh

[22557.05s -> 22560.09s]  Is something I probably never would have done a few years ago
[22561.63s -> 22563.63s]  I never used to play the same game
[22564.67s -> 22569.31s]  More than one or two streams. I would just abandon it because I just didn't think people would stay interested
[22570.20s -> 22572.20s]  And I don't think I would stay interested
[22574.41s -> 22576.49s]  so i'm
[22576.49s -> 22578.17s]  it's not like
[22578.17s -> 22582.52s]  It's not a big deal
[22582.52s -> 22586.92s]  Sorcery sorcery was a different case because sorcery was it's one of my favorite things ever
[22587.56s -> 22600.77s]  Streaming sorcery 10 to 12 times and that's just one of my favorite experiences
[22608.19s -> 22613.48s]  Yeah, but I never write off any game. I never say that i'm not going to do something. So
[22614.60s -> 22617.02s]  There's definitely a chance
[22617.02s -> 22623.10s]  CDT thanks for the thousand bits ten dollars jerma. I've been a fan since 2012 and I watched your pyromaniac video specifically
[22623.90s -> 22625.18s]  a long time
[22625.18s -> 22629.26s]  I'm turning 22 today and I want to thank you for being one of the positive influences in my life
[22631.80s -> 22633.88s]  It's a very long time that I forget that a lot
[22635.79s -> 22638.92s]  That next year
[22639.72s -> 22640.68s]  is
[22640.68s -> 22642.52s]  10 straight years
[22642.52s -> 22646.57s]  Doing this
[22646.57s -> 22648.73s]  2021 will be 10 full years
[22650.16s -> 22652.16s]  Doing either youtube or twitch
[22653.20s -> 22655.44s]  without stopping
[22655.44s -> 22660.56s]  There's been a couple of times when I haven't been around for a couple weeks two or three weeks is the maximum
[22660.80s -> 22662.80s]  I think i've ever not been around
[22662.96s -> 22666.40s]  But i've been around at least every week or two
[22667.12s -> 22668.32s]  10 years
[22668.32s -> 22670.32s]  That's crazy to think about that
[22677.61s -> 22694.30s]  Oh, there absolutely will be an anniversary stream and I knew you from the servers. See somebody's here that knows me from the servers
[22696.12s -> 22701.50s]  Gigantic air quotes
[22701.50s -> 22704.86s]  But uh, yeah, thank you for the 10 bucks cdt
[22706.12s -> 22708.36s]  Glad to have you around. Thanks for sticking around for so long
[22710.72s -> 22714.32s]  Toadside picnic. Thanks for the 300 bits jerma fellow mass hole here
[22714.80s -> 22721.88s]  Do you miss the chaotic yet inexpensive atmosphere that is market basket? I do miss something very specific from market basket
[22722.60s -> 22725.88s]  Market basket had uh, probably the best
[22726.84s -> 22731.80s]  Ginger ginger ale they had a golden ginger ale. It was market basket golden ginger ale brand
[22732.60s -> 22735.80s]  It's probably the best ginger ale i've had nothing can really replace it
[22736.66s -> 22744.32s]  unfortunate
[22744.32s -> 22746.73s]  You know, you know
[22746.73s -> 22749.21s]  I could probably order it somehow but it'd be weird
[22750.01s -> 22758.32s]  It'd be weird. But yeah, I I used to I did get stuff from there
[22761.74s -> 22767.13s]  Thanks to the 300 bits
[22767.13s -> 22769.05s]  Let's put on
[22769.05s -> 22770.33s]  The e-credits
[22770.33s -> 22778.35s]  We can switch this don't you love how I haven't had this highest tip bit leader top sub thing to work
[22778.51s -> 22780.51s]  I've never got it to work once
[22780.51s -> 22787.47s]  People just are waiting for that to happen. This never happened once. There's just no one. No one's getting there's no top sub gifter ever
[22790.57s -> 22796.62s]  Like am I ever gonna get this fixed it kind of worked the first week. Yeah, and then just stopped
[22799.63s -> 22804.03s]  Well, it's those people in the chairs. That's what you don't understand. It's always that guy in the chair
[22804.11s -> 22806.11s]  It's always the slug and it's always the
[22806.67s -> 22811.63s]  Animorph someday we'll know
[22812.65s -> 22815.29s]  Someday we will know
[22815.29s -> 22816.67s]  We will
[22816.67s -> 22818.67s]  That day is not today. Unfortunately
[22824.20s -> 22826.20s]  Anyways, as always thanks again guys
[22828.80s -> 22830.80s]  We'll hopefully see you tomorrow
[22830.80s -> 22832.24s]  for the
[22832.24s -> 22835.92s]  Holy shit. That's a lot of people for the conclusion of mario sunshine
[22837.08s -> 22842.64s]  However long that takes
[22842.64s -> 22843.84s]  That's fast
[22843.84s -> 22852.80s]  There are three or four more bits to do
[22853.37s -> 22854.33s]  as these
[22854.33s -> 22857.05s]  Insane credits roll out from the hundreds of gifted subs
[22857.77s -> 22859.77s]  And hundreds of regular subs
[22859.93s -> 22867.92s]  It's not just the gifted subs
[22867.92s -> 22873.16s]  Thanks guys never the new year's stream. That was ridiculous
[22874.14s -> 22878.22s]  I think that new year's stream. I think there were two to three thousand subs on that stream
[22878.78s -> 22887.68s]  That was out of control
[22894.99s -> 22896.99s]  He fucking loves us
[22897.74s -> 22899.34s]  Of course I do
[22899.34s -> 22903.93s]  What do you think this is?
[22903.93s -> 22907.13s]  Bulbaswag disney. Thanks for the 500 bits. This is one of my favorite childhood games
[22907.21s -> 22909.21s]  I'm, so happy you're finally jumping and diving
[22909.53s -> 22914.41s]  I've been spamming it every once in a while the movement mechanics is one of the best things about the game also spray water on
[22914.41s -> 22915.77s]  the birds
[22915.77s -> 22926.16s]  Again bulbaswag five more dolls here that one spot you found to get yoshi over there on that island is completely awful
[22926.72s -> 22928.72s]  If you want to cheese it here's a video
[22928.88s -> 22932.59s]  You can get yoshi out of bounds super easily into that island
[22932.59s -> 22937.31s]  But like it's not necessary or anything just a trick heads up from me your pal
[22938.03s -> 22943.92s]  Getting yoshi over there is awful
[22943.92s -> 22954.77s]  Maybe i'll give it a look use noclip on the emulator
[22962.59s -> 22967.07s]  Goosely charmed thanks to the 250 hey germa first time donator wanted to share something that happened at work
[22968.14s -> 22971.50s]  I was running late to a meeting and it was my turn to present
[22972.30s -> 22977.10s]  I airplayed my computer screen and some audio of a guy talking started playing
[22977.74s -> 22982.30s]  I was so confused for a few seconds until I realized I had paused a video of yours
[22982.78s -> 22987.92s]  And it had started auto playing all I can say is thank god you were being somewhat normal
[22988.32s -> 22990.72s]  And not crying to farting and screaming
[22991.64s -> 22994.20s]  Anyways, love the stream. Oh, man
[22995.16s -> 23001.60s]  what's the over under okay, if you took every single stream i've ever done and
[23002.48s -> 23011.12s]  Calculate how many hours that stream was all of them together and then rolled dice to see to pick a time spot
[23012.70s -> 23014.70s]  on that gigantic hundred
[23015.64s -> 23018.30s]  Two thousand five thousand plus hour video
[23018.94s -> 23023.98s]  What's the over under that it would be something fucking ridiculous or something fucked up that was happening on the stream?
[23029.92s -> 23038.42s]  Wouldn't be 100 70 if I was a psycho
[23039.61s -> 23045.56s]  Which I i'm not i'm not
[23046.60s -> 23048.75s]  Imagine if we did a coin
[23048.75s -> 23052.59s]  cost rng stream where it's every stream i've ever done
[23054.88s -> 23057.20s]  And every 10 minutes we pull the fucking lever
[23058.30s -> 23063.26s]  And it picks a random spot in like 2 000 hours of 4 000 hours of streaming
[23063.98s -> 23075.93s]  That would be kind of fun
[23075.93s -> 23083.34s]  Do that for the anniversary
[23085.37s -> 23087.37s]  That's a massive video file
[23088.49s -> 23090.49s]  I don't think that would be possible
[23090.81s -> 23094.17s]  Yeah, that would be a video file that was thousands of hours long
[23095.13s -> 23096.81s]  I don't think that's possible
[23096.81s -> 23108.24s]  I have a 50 terabyte but I would have to get an external hard drive. That was a petabyte or something
[23108.88s -> 23115.15s]  I'm gonna hold on to that because that's so dumb that it might be worth doing
[23115.87s -> 23122.28s]  Let up a generator that takes videos from the archive channel and gives you a random time stamp
[23125.90s -> 23128.44s]  Yeah, i'll look into this
[23128.44s -> 23130.44s]  I'm actually gonna for real look into this
[23131.08s -> 23144.89s]  Put all the streams in a playlist and roll the dice to choose a stream to do then roll again to choose the video
[23145.85s -> 23147.90s]  and time
[23147.90s -> 23149.90s]  It's possible. It's very possible
[23150.46s -> 23160.76s]  Yeah, i'm gonna do that. We'll do that
[23160.76s -> 23164.97s]  Put it on the list
[23164.97s -> 23166.97s]  anyways, we had um
[23167.56s -> 23170.54s]  30 30 dollars 3 000 bits from atlantius
[23171.48s -> 23174.62s]  Thanks for the 30 drop dude
[23174.62s -> 23180.12s]  I wanted to ask if you're planning on doing some kind of live in in-person show
[23180.76s -> 23183.88s]  I'll be willing to go to vegas and watch you perform in some way
[23186.56s -> 23190.91s]  It hasn't really come up
[23190.91s -> 23192.99s]  Something about that is very very funny to me
[23193.87s -> 23197.15s]  If I somehow got to rent out one of the theaters
[23199.24s -> 23201.00s]  On the strip or something
[23201.00s -> 23203.56s]  And for two nights only
[23204.19s -> 23206.91s]  I did just a terrible show
[23207.55s -> 23209.55s]  Like it was an hour or two long
[23209.79s -> 23216.76s]  That would be so bad
[23217.10s -> 23220.06s]  And make a fake almost infomercial esque
[23221.88s -> 23223.88s]  Commercial and trailer for it
[23226.67s -> 23230.75s]  And play that for a couple weeks before it happens and start selling tickets and stuff
[23231.55s -> 23240.65s]  Make the tickets two hundred dollars. Well, that would be a real asshole thing to do
[23241.37s -> 23244.89s]  Eclers in the crowd
[23245.29s -> 23255.74s]  Put a bunch of plants in to fake laugh at stuff and only see I only only sell 50 tickets and have
[23256.06s -> 23262.06s]  Hire a thousand people to come and crack the fuck up at everything and get cameras and film a live special
[23268.89s -> 23271.85s]  Have two people in the audience be actual real people
[23272.57s -> 23275.15s]  And the rest are just plants
[23275.15s -> 23276.51s]  Don't tell any of them
[23276.51s -> 23285.04s]  No, i'm gonna at that point. That's just an elaborate prank on two people
[23287.63s -> 23293.47s]  That's stupid
[23293.47s -> 23297.48s]  Now put it on the list
[23297.48s -> 23300.44s]  Thanks for the thirty dollars though, dude. Thank you going for the 500 bits
[23300.44s -> 23302.68s]  My favorite part of the stream is when you do bad at gaming
[23303.77s -> 23308.89s]  Hold on my favorite part of this stream is when you do a bad gaming moment and you just get mad at mario
[23308.97s -> 23310.97s]  Like why did mario just do that?
[23315.32s -> 23316.28s]  Why
[23316.28s -> 23320.44s]  There are some things that he like jumps over the pole and shit without me pressing anything
[23320.44s -> 23323.08s]  He does sometimes he does things without me doing anything
[23323.64s -> 23332.48s]  Mario is trying his best
[23334.40s -> 23336.40s]  And who is controlling him?
[23336.80s -> 23342.32s]  I am directing him but he is in control. I am directing him with an analog stick
[23342.80s -> 23348.83s]  But he has to run
[23348.83s -> 23350.83s]  If you put an earpiece in my ear
[23351.32s -> 23353.15s]  and said up
[23353.15s -> 23356.11s]  Right down up up if you just I would I would run up
[23356.83s -> 23358.83s]  But I still have to run it's my legs
[23367.61s -> 23369.61s]  Is he here right now?
[23381.12s -> 23383.12s]  Like i'm on one of those tv shows
[23383.84s -> 23386.08s]  Or i'm telling you there's a ghost that lives in my house
[23387.88s -> 23389.88s]  And I start going oh
[23390.27s -> 23392.16s]  Jeremy
[23392.16s -> 23394.16s]  Is he in the room right now?
[23395.10s -> 23398.11s]  Yeah. Yep. Explain it to me
[23404.57s -> 23407.45s]  Hey blackout. Thanks for the thousand bits and that's our final
[23408.17s -> 23409.37s]  Hit of the night
[23409.37s -> 23411.00s]  Move over here
[23411.00s -> 23420.57s]  Thanks for watching everybody
[23420.57s -> 23427.44s]  Uh blackout says for ten dollars thousand bits. Thank you blackout. Jeremy listen to your stream at work
[23428.16s -> 23433.53s]  Uh, I work at party city and today you made me laugh while talking to a customer
[23434.17s -> 23438.25s]  I had to yank out my earbuds stop laughing. She must have thought I was insane
[23438.89s -> 23439.93s]  Thanks for the content, man
[23439.93s -> 23445.29s]  I know you say we shouldn't feel obligated to donate but i've used your stream to make my workdays far better too much
[23446.01s -> 23454.22s]  to not donate keep it up for riffing your earbuds out
[23457.87s -> 23459.87s]  Yeah, you just be like i'm watching uh
[23460.67s -> 23465.31s]  I'm watching tv or something. Well, you can't you won't be that doesn't make any sense. You listen to a funny podcast
[23471.52s -> 23473.52s]  I appreciate that though. Thank you. I
[23474.46s -> 23477.58s]  No one's ever obligated to give this channel money. Some people give a lot
[23478.65s -> 23482.41s]  Some people give some some people don't give anything at all and all that is completely fine
[23483.05s -> 23485.55s]  That's all perfectly fine. All of it
[23489.68s -> 23495.20s]  Don't feel obligated to give a cent to this channel if you do i've really fucking appreciate it if you don't thanks for being here
[23495.44s -> 23497.52s]  Thanks for watching
[23497.52s -> 23501.79s]  You contribute as well
[23501.79s -> 23506.83s]  If a thousand of you guys two thousand three thousand of you are not subbed to the channel, but you watch the stream
[23507.71s -> 23509.71s]  That does it benefits the stream?
[23510.33s -> 23511.63s]  immensely
[23511.63s -> 23525.04s]  I will never give you money and you should you that's that's totally fine
[23525.68s -> 23527.68s]  Don't worry about that. You don't have to ever
[23537.34s -> 23539.58s]  When will we know if germy's in financial trouble?
[23540.94s -> 23544.14s]  If I do a raid shadow legends ad on my stream
[23545.18s -> 23547.44s]  That's when you know
[23547.44s -> 23549.12s]  Something's wrong
[23559.04s -> 23561.52s]  Can I watch this stream while i'm nude? Yeah, go for it
[23570.75s -> 23572.86s]  See you guys tomorrow
[23572.86s -> 23576.54s]  Have a fantastic rest of your night. Thanks for watching mario sunshine. We're gonna finish it tomorrow
[23577.28s -> 23578.40s]  Good night
