[0.50s -> 13.86s]  Hello. Good afternoon. My name, if I may present myself, is Mixy. Nice to finally meet you face to
[13.86s -> 36.87s]  face. Really? Hold on. Did you make a 3D movie maker reference and you see minus two? Really guys?
[36.87s -> 47.82s]  That's interesting. I wonder if uh that's odd. I really thought that was gonna hit. Well anyways,
[47.82s -> 61.78s]  hi welcome. Uh we are at the point of the stream when we do Sam and Max. This will be the final
[62.90s -> 70.97s]  Sam and Max themed streams. After season three, I have no plans on doing the rest of Sam and Max,
[70.97s -> 74.89s]  all the other games that they have. There's no plan to do that. But if I started season one,
[74.89s -> 79.93s]  I want to do season two and season three. And that's what we're gonna do. After this,
[80.89s -> 87.50s]  you might not see it again because I know that there is at least one or two other games in this
[87.50s -> 94.30s]  franchise. But there are a couple other things to talk about before we get started.
[95.61s -> 106.70s]  First thing to talk about is we have some things to watch. We have two videos that from yesterday
[106.70s -> 116.23s]  that I want to show on the screen. We'll just wait. Let me just give me a minute. Let people
[116.23s -> 169.19s]  trickle in and I'll be with you very shortly. Two minutes. Okay so this first one we're gonna watch
[171.03s -> 180.97s]  is from uh it's time for slime. This is called uh German DOS. Let's go ahead and get it on the
[180.97s -> 190.06s]  screen for you. Uh chunky baloney just came in with 10 community subs. Holy shit. Thank you so much.
[192.65s -> 196.81s]  These 10 and 20 community subs, the last couple of days, the last like three or four streams have
[196.81s -> 202.97s]  been like a dozen of these 10 plus community subs. Thank you guys. That's a fucking lot.

[255.34s -> 266.41s]  than Scrooge McDuck. I'm gonna get it into pennies and put it into a pool. It'll appreciate in value.
[267.13s -> 273.62s]  All right here we go. I actually think I can just do this. Yeah I have this from yesterday.
[275.82s -> 287.59s]  Oh my god. Uh thank you for the 10 community subs, Bebraham. Even more subs coming in.
[288.65s -> 299.40s]  And all I said was like hey and then I went whoa I made my bed laughed. You guys missed

[381.14s -> 391.26s]  Oh my god. These are these are I gotta put my good shoes on. I got my smurf what is it is
[391.26s -> 395.26s]  this the account that you go on to like talk shit to people and then like whatever I get bad who
[395.26s -> 407.58s]  cares. Not even my real name. Uh Pon Pon Fresh five community subs. See somebody just said fuck
[407.58s -> 412.30s]  you to me. Guarantee you that person comes back on another account that's like Jerma's the man is

[422.15s -> 428.25s]  Thank you all of you for the the massive amount of monetary support here before the stream
[428.25s -> 440.55s]  even started. So thank you guys. See the real thing I'm not even gonna give you this idea.
[440.55s -> 448.23s]  If I give you this idea that would be that would be not good for me. Back in five community subs.
[448.23s -> 456.95s]  Nintendo got a community sub. Are you serious? Dude Nintendo's subbing to me? That's fucking oh wow.
[456.95s -> 468.73s]  I can't believe it. Nintendo is not in the chat. You can give a community sub to anybody. Are they
[468.73s -> 478.76s]  here? Nintendo liars. Sometimes you have to check. What if they were like scouting me out to do like
[478.76s -> 488.42s]  a I don't know like a Super Mario sponsorship or something. It could happen. All right here we go.
[488.42s -> 494.20s]  That was from back in Let's Go. Let's watch this video. This is called Jerma Dos. Are you ready? One
[497.45s -> 580.82s]  two three. No porn games. The table. What did that say? Of course it has to end on that.
[581.54s -> 593.11s]  It has to end on that. What did the opposite say? Hold on. I clocked you rooming at 32 over the limit. I hate
[593.11s -> 604.70s]  to do it but I'm gonna have to write you up a ticket. Okay here we go. That face. Speaking of movies
[605.74s -> 613.66s]  that is what it looks like in the dark when you are talking and somebody in front of you looks
[613.66s -> 618.94s]  behind to try to essentially tell you. That's like a shut the fuck up face. That's like a what are
[618.94s -> 639.64s]  you really doing this face. That's what it looks like in the dark. Hold on yeah it's like this.
[640.71s -> 647.22s]  Here comes like the climax of the movie. Oh my god here he comes. I can't say any I can't make
[647.22s -> 655.19s]  a pretend climax because somebody will say it's a spoiler for some movie. Like right now the person
[655.19s -> 661.43s]  is describing their love for the other character and they're about to like have a big kiss moment.
[661.99s -> 691.46s]  They're about to kiss on screen and then they just go and they turn back around. Nobody talks like
[691.46s -> 697.78s]  shit anymore. Have you noticed that? I don't know what it used to be. You'd be sitting in a movie
[697.78s -> 703.98s]  theater and somebody would be like shit shut up. No I once last year heard somebody scream
[703.98s -> 710.14s]  at a movie theater before. I've been to a bunch of movies in the last few years and I've not heard
[710.14s -> 720.49s]  it. I mean I've I've I've done it a few times. I mean but that's me doing that. Am I the guy now?
[721.50s -> 734.06s]  I don't hear other people do it. It's just me. Right okay. Oh shit I got too old. All right here
[734.06s -> 740.98s]  comes the next one. The next one is another. It's an animation from Googly Gareth. They passed the
[740.98s -> 750.86s]  theater yelling torch to you. Maybe they did. No I don't want to yell. I don't yell in movie theaters.
[751.42s -> 765.61s]  Who do you think I am? I yell after the movie's over. I clap at the credits. All right here we go.
[765.61s -> 774.33s]  This is called German animated streaming superstar. Actually let's just do this.
[774.33s -> 792.90s]  Let's get rid of the white background here. There we go. Okay all right ready. This is called
[792.90s -> 798.10s]  streaming superstar. Three two one let's go. I can't even beat a b-list. Well it doesn't matter.
[798.10s -> 805.66s]  That's not my style. That's not my style. I'm not gonna. I don't do cell phone commercials.
[805.66s -> 819.56s]  You see how good my other commercials went with a toothpaste? Wash your teeth if you want. Not go
[819.56s -> 825.66s]  to fucking jail kids. Nobody can beat me in those. I'm so much more popular than all these people.
[825.66s -> 829.34s]  You think I care about this guy with a pegasus commercial with a shitty car? Have you seen my
[829.34s -> 847.11s]  germ commercial? It's 10 times better. Toilet sheriff. It's high noon for gamers. Get germs.
[847.91s -> 852.71s]  I remember the deodorant commercial. I sold that. You know how many copies of the deodorant were
[852.71s -> 869.56s]  sold? You know how many copies were sold? 25,000 in one day. They're holding me hostage and making
[869.56s -> 877.26s]  me film these commercials. So go take your car that like 10 people bought and break. I'm the
[877.26s -> 882.94s]  important one here. Name something you need a lot of if you have a large family. I swear to god
[883.50s -> 890.78s]  if this answer is love I'm gonna put a hole through my screen. Don't fucking be love.
[890.78s -> 895.74s]  You already got the cheeky answer in there. Who's the one person that wrote love? And like you know
[895.74s -> 898.78s]  you know when they asked and they said love and they winked it's gonna be love.
[900.54s -> 907.43s]  Yeah oh yeah love you know. Wink. One person. It's gonna be one. One person. Fucking assholes.
[907.43s -> 912.31s]  Oh yeah you need lots of patience. You need lots of love. We're three people that said this.
[912.95s -> 916.71s]  We like said it and then grabbed the person like on the shoulder and we're like hey you know what
[916.71s -> 920.95s]  I mean love and then they like tripped and dropped their fucking coffee and the rest of their day
[920.95s -> 925.03s]  sucked. They like stepped in a fucking huge puddle after they said that. They were like oh yeah love
[925.03s -> 928.63s]  wink. Thank you for your time. Yeah I'll see you later. Thank oh yeah I gave you some good answers
[928.63s -> 932.39s]  some really specific shitty ones. Yeah see you later and they turn and fucking go in the puddle
[932.39s -> 935.75s]  like they fucking goes all over their fucking pants and shit and their coffee goes everywhere
[935.75s -> 940.39s]  and the rest of their day was terrible. All right name a real or fictional person with Grant
[940.39s -> 947.21s]  and his or her name. Hugh Grant. No Grant uh it was the president. What was the president's name?
[947.21s -> 954.65s]  The president. Uh Grantly. No he's on the fucking $50 bill. What's his name? Quick.
[956.09s -> 962.34s]  What's his name? Alexander Van Grant? Alexander Grant? Who's the guy? Who's the president?
[963.16s -> 974.02s]  Ulysses Grant? Yes Ulysses Grant. Shit. How do you spell Ulysses?
[974.66s -> 981.21s]  Fuck it. We're doing Hugh Grant. Wait what? I gotta look this up right now. How do I look?
[981.21s -> 985.53s]  I'm just gonna type it into Google right now. You guys are gonna be too far behind. Ulysses.
[986.57s -> 994.33s]  U-L-Y? Ulysses Grant. Oh shit that's I.
[997.13s -> 1008.73s]  I who? Oh my god. He's gonna do Ulysses. He's gonna do Ulysses. Damn it.
[1009.05s -> 1020.18s]  Do you want to see the category? Here goes fictional character. Donald Duck.
[1020.18s -> 1025.38s]  Donald Duck. Donald Duck. Donald Duck. Donald Duck. Donald Duck. Donald Duck. Donald Duck.
[1026.02s -> 1033.14s]  That's Donald Duck. Donald fucking Duck.
[1058.62s -> 1067.30s]  What a shitty ending. Ah that was those are fucking great. That was called a streaming superstar
[1068.26s -> 1079.48s]  by Googly Gareth. A very talented animator. I'm not I'm not like that you know. This is this
[1079.48s -> 1084.60s]  specific eclipse that I take it of of moments where I you know I have a little bit of trouble
[1084.60s -> 1089.29s]  but it's not like that all the time. If you're new to the channel it's not really it's not like
[1089.29s -> 1097.13s]  that all the time. It's only like that like sometimes. If a stream is like seven or eight
[1097.13s -> 1101.29s]  hours I feel like four hours is that. That's not even 40 percent. That's like that's a half.
[1106.81s -> 1117.69s]  It's it's only when he's talking. It's funnily enough 40 to 50 percent of the stream probably
[1117.69s -> 1125.00s]  is me talking. The other 50 60 percent is like game stuff and stuff on the screen. So you know
[1125.99s -> 1134.04s]  you're probably right. Anyways those are two very very very very funny very interesting videos
[1134.04s -> 1138.36s]  back to back. We are going to move on from that. We're going to do we're going to start Sam and
[1138.36s -> 1149.40s]  Max season three. You have to have a high enough percentage to be a C plus streamer.
[1149.40s -> 1155.58s]  I'll take a C plus. I know it's B minus. I was downgraded. What is it? What's it on social
[1155.58s -> 1160.25s]  blade right now? Is it did I get it? I haven't checked this in a long time actually. What is it?
[1160.89s -> 1177.83s]  What's my like twitch social blade right now? What do I have for grade? Oh come on man. That's a B
[1177.83s -> 1194.23s]  plus. It used to be B minus. Oh I'm happy about that. Oh this is not an intro anymore. Hey look
[1194.23s -> 1202.55s]  at that. Sam and Max. So again we're going to play this for that's what we're going to do today.
[1202.55s -> 1207.37s]  Tomorrow by the way Star and I are going to play something. We don't know what it is. It's going
[1207.37s -> 1212.81s]  to be a mystery game. We both actually don't know what the game is. We haven't talked. All I know is
[1212.81s -> 1218.20s]  that we're going to play something together. I'm sure we'll probably figure that out in like an
[1218.20s -> 1227.35s]  hour before the stream. So I'll see you tomorrow. No no no no I'm not leaving yet. We'll do that
[1227.35s -> 1236.14s]  tomorrow. But for today we're going to do Sam and Max and let's watch two videos and end the
[1236.14s -> 1247.78s]  stream after 20 minutes. Speaking of stuff happening on the stream KXZ gave $50. Thank you
[1247.78s -> 1254.30s]  KXZ for your 50 bucks and they say hope you're doing well Jerma. Always a good day when that
[1254.30s -> 1261.32s]  live notification pops up. Thank you. That's a lot of money. You've given a lot of money over the
[1261.32s -> 1285.72s]  years. Wait is there another video? Is it a third? Was there a third video? This looks like a meme
[1285.72s -> 1323.16s]  video. Is this a meme video? Is this a meme video? Okay is this is this safe for stream? No yes yes
[1323.16s -> 1329.93s]  yes yes yes okay all right all right of course it is. All right we're gonna watch two we're gonna
[1329.93s -> 1335.35s]  watch two more videos. All right this is it. This is it. No more videos after this.

[1447.14s -> 1455.08s]  this one. What would you love to say about this? That's what I want to know. Oh so what you were
[1455.08s -> 1461.00s]  watching a live streamer today? Yeah I was. Oh what and and uh what did you type in the chat room?
[1461.00s -> 1465.64s]  There's a chat room I heard. Yep there's a chat room. Oh so what did you write? Like hey cool
[1465.64s -> 1478.55s]  design nice product. Nice bulge. Oh you said that? You're grounded. It's true. All right it's true.
[1478.55s -> 1487.99s]  All right that's it for videos. No more videos. Let me at least press new game on this.
[1493.21s -> 1498.01s]  Subscribe. Subscribe to that. I'm not I haven't been logged into YouTube in like fucking four
[1498.01s -> 1504.65s]  years. I can't. I don't I don't I have no login. All right let's go. Sam and Max.
[1505.45s -> 1521.35s]  The forever delayed Sam and Max stream. Let's get it over here. All right. Welcome to Sam and Max.
[1521.99s -> 1531.37s]  Enjoy your stay here. What? New game. I don't know how loud this is going to be.
[1531.37s -> 1542.38s]  Prepare yourself. How is it? Is it all right? Is it good? Too loud. Is it too loud?
[1543.82s -> 1555.66s]  I I can't see it over here. I need a mod. It's live? In all the universe the only power beyond
[1555.66s -> 1565.70s]  the mind's comprehension is the power to comprehend the power of the mind. If any one of us could
[1565.70s -> 1572.82s]  unlock this terrible power would we use it to explore the mysteries of the infinite or would
[1572.82s -> 1587.93s]  we use it to destroy? Yes. Tremble earthlings. Tremble before the might of General Scutafi.
[1593.05s -> 1598.73s]  You know Sam Skunk Ape may be a tool but he brings a refreshingly childlike glee to his work.
[1604.97s -> 1608.17s]  All right I'm here Max. It's hard to stay mad at this guy.
[1613.50s -> 1619.70s]  Miss Sam and Max stop the dreadnoughts.
[1626.90s -> 1633.70s]  I will destroy you and then dominate the entire galaxy.
[1637.22s -> 1642.74s]  Wait. Okay yeah I can. I didn't know if I was gonna skip it accidentally or not.
[1642.74s -> 1657.46s]  I didn't know. Okay I think we're good. Which one of us is the fuzzy one? Better? It's a familiar
[1657.46s -> 1665.83s]  tale. A space gorilla pitted against a canine detective and a sociopathic bunny with psychic
[1665.83s -> 1675.35s]  powers. But my friends this story is different. In this story you are in control. Only you can
[1675.35s -> 1685.22s]  release our heroes. General Scunk Ape's bizarre space suit. A quest to bring the victor to space
[1685.22s -> 1695.45s]  justice. Let's begin the tour. I knew somebody was gonna say it. One person said it. We could
[1695.45s -> 1700.57s]  just reach my gun. We could administer an old school freelance police style beat down to that
[1700.57s -> 1706.97s]  guy. I can't wait to get my stinking paws on that damn dirty ape. Simmer down Max. Check out
[1706.97s -> 1711.61s]  stinky cell phone. We're gonna need that and your creepy new brain powers to get out of this cage.
[1711.61s -> 1720.70s]  Gotta get cell phone. Whoa whoa whoa 3D. All right you can switch you can switch control between Sam
[1720.70s -> 1726.54s]  and Max by clicking on the freelance police badge in the corner of your screen. Try switching to Max
[1726.54s -> 1741.13s]  to use his psychic powers. Okay what why does Max have psychic powers in this one? You are now inside
[1741.13s -> 1748.49s]  the dankest recesses of Max's mind where you can attempt to control his horrible psychic abilities
[1748.57s -> 1756.09s]  unlocked by the toys of power. Okay when inside Max's brain you can look around by clicking and
[1756.09s -> 1762.09s]  dragging the mouse over using the WASD keys. To activate Max's teleportation power click on the
[1762.09s -> 1770.95s]  toy telephone. Okay well done my friends now select a phone number that Max has memorized
[1770.95s -> 1778.07s]  to teleport himself and his very long-time companion to that location and also Sam.
[1779.67s -> 1783.91s]  The toy phone has a button for each of the phone numbers Max has memorized. Click on the button
[1783.91s -> 1794.55s]  with stinky's picture to teleport to her cell phone. This is a joke you think right?
[1795.35s -> 1805.61s]  We have to do that every time. It's the freelance police. Oh baby I've missed you.
[1805.77s -> 1821.30s]  Now what? Listen to the brain. Hey Sam it's our new pal the disembodied alien brain. The same I am
[1821.30s -> 1829.78s]  speaking to you telepathically. No one else can hear me Sam and Max. The slug brain? I can. Shut
[1829.78s -> 1836.18s]  up your earth weapons will never be enough to defeat General Skunkapne. Don't you still have
[1836.18s -> 1846.68s]  that beacons? Okay to see what Sam is carrying in his inventory click on the cardboard box in the
[1846.68s -> 1852.34s]  corner. All right so the cardboard box is still here. These are all the items. Find the homing
[1852.34s -> 1859.75s]  beacon and left click on it to make Sam pull it out. This is the remote control. This is the homing
[1859.75s -> 1869.56s]  beacon. Do I have to do it? Just click it okay. Perfect now you must place the homing beacon on
[1869.56s -> 1881.37s]  General Skunkapne's back to trap him in the wheel zone. Easy throw it as hard as you can.
[1882.73s -> 1886.57s]  Click on a target make Sam use it on that yeah putting on the yeah just throw it as hard as you
[1886.57s -> 1898.65s]  can just don't miss. What's that? Did you really believe it would be that easy? Kind of kind of
[1898.65s -> 1904.17s]  yeah we're gonna need some kind of cover to get up close and personal with Skunkapne. Max remember
[1904.17s -> 1910.01s]  that you have been blessed with the gift you must unlock your abilities with the remaining toys of
[1910.01s -> 1922.86s]  power. Behold! Meat? Uh hang on there we go. Is that a nose? That's a that's a nose okay
[1924.15s -> 1931.88s]  you can make Sam use objects in the world by just nice click it. It's a lump of rhinoplasty the
[1931.88s -> 1936.60s]  wacky modeling clay that promises hours of fun and delivers about five to ten minutes work.
[1937.40s -> 1948.34s]  Okay so I got the nose. Max the rhinoplasty will grant you the incredible power of
[1948.42s -> 1954.58s]  shapeshifting. You can use the rhinoplasty to pick up a picture of any inanimate object
[1954.58s -> 1958.66s]  then use the power of your mind to transform into that object. This is a dream sequence or something.
[1964.09s -> 1968.73s]  Max now has the power of rhinoplasty remember stop doing that remember that you can left click on
[1968.73s -> 1974.81s]  one of the psychic toys to activate it. When the rhinoplasty is selected Max first has to choose
[1974.81s -> 1980.49s]  a picture of the thing he wants to turn into. You can make Max look around by clicking and dragging
[1980.81s -> 1997.62s]  WASD and then left click on a picture to make Max pick it up. A plant? You can turn into that object
[1997.62s -> 2007.45s]  you can click on the lump of rhinoplasty to activate it. Try to look leafy and inconspicuous
[2007.45s -> 2014.57s]  Max. I always do. Well done freelance police. Now you must get that homing beacon onto General
[2014.57s -> 2021.61s]  Skunkape before he reaches the Bronx or all will be lost. I think I can do it you can make Sam walk
[2021.61s -> 2045.46s]  by clicking and dragging or you can do they added WASD finally okay it's just a plant. Oh a plant

[2056.06s -> 2065.50s]  they are. Now what? Now we just used the remote control Mama Bosco gave us and Skunkape gets
[2065.50s -> 2074.97s]  sucked right in the penal zone so to speak. All right remote control some of the objects the same
[2075.61s -> 2079.61s]  activated on their own highlight the penal zone remote control then left click the activate icon
[2079.61s -> 2100.01s]  all right well hold on that's activate right Sam and Max but I'm far too strong to be captured

[2107.45s -> 2112.89s]  over his mouth. I know. You would cut your mouth up every time you were talking. There must be something
[2113.45s -> 2116.65s]  I'm talking about like a big like glulate stain of blood all over your whole mouth
[2117.53s -> 2123.93s]  I can't open the doors now but I have an idea before he was in prison your friend the mole
[2123.93s -> 2128.73s]  man was screaming something about taking over the ship find out what he knows

[2146.09s -> 2149.85s]  Oh shift is run just like a regular video game. All right Harry Moleman how you doing?

[2245.24s -> 2250.78s]  I just pretended to know what I was doing and would read chat and some one person would say
[2250.78s -> 2256.23s]  the solution and then I would walk around for like a couple minutes pretending I was solving the
[2256.23s -> 2262.39s]  puzzle when in reality I knew the answer like 10 minutes before and was just piecing it all together
[2263.11s -> 2278.06s]  to make it look like I knew what was going on that I'm kidding people you guys are taking this too

[5736.58s -> 5741.70s]  winning ticket on unemployed losers who don't understand how numbers work and then we liquidate
[5741.70s -> 5752.02s]  if you bought well no wait uh one okay the winning ticket is going to be in his personal
[5752.02s -> 5757.82s]  belongings so how do we do the lottery drawing though that's the question are you sure that

[5807.66s -> 5812.62s]  but you don't know anything about science or hygiene which means i'll never go mad and take
[5812.62s -> 5821.02s]  over the lab for my own twisted experiments i'm perfect that's not a you know you're not wrong
[5822.46s -> 5828.06s]  i thought you already had a job apparently there was some kind of power shakeup i got laid off
[5828.62s -> 5834.14s]  you guys aren't looking for another partner are you no we'll uh keep your resume on file
[5834.14s -> 5838.86s]  in case there's an opening let's liquidate him so when he has to hold on right i've got
[5839.42s -> 5844.14s]  yeah the lottery is just for unemployed losers who don't know so how many tickets have you bought

[6049.08s -> 6053.96s]  though it's a good thing we're trying to steal it too or we'd be offended by that remark couldn't
[6053.96s -> 6059.00s]  have come at a worse time either i've almost got my dimensional destabilizer working but the
[6059.00s -> 6064.76s]  dimensional rift generator is useless without power man if i had a nickel for every time i
[6064.76s -> 6071.40s]  didn't understand what you just said okay what did this power core thing look like it looks
[6071.40s -> 6076.84s]  like a car battery question it looks like a power core you know that's like asking what a
[6076.84s -> 6084.28s]  bander poop particle emitter looks like what does a bander what is a bandicoot power i don't
[6084.28s -> 6092.42s]  remember even what you just said the new lab is um nice thanks for saying so but it needs work
[6092.42s -> 6096.82s]  do you have any idea how hard it is to find abandoned real estate in manhattan that's not
[6096.82s -> 6102.82s]  already haunted it is a dyer's market i had to start reading the exorcism listings in the paper
[6102.82s -> 6110.60s]  just to find a lead on this place okay where's bosco dr mama bosco your lab is actually pretty
[6110.60s -> 6116.36s]  impressive i don't know where he is bosco's inventions always kind of well uh sucked yes

[6148.94s -> 6154.38s]  got a system plus 15 billion dollars left over from the money that some idiots gave him for
[6154.38s -> 6164.68s]  his inventions i'm sure those idiots had very good reasons okay what about the did you hear
[6164.68s -> 6169.88s]  about the alien gorilla that landed on our street yeah it came through on the news alert something
[6169.88s -> 6175.96s]  about sharing alien technology and ending all of poverty and disease on earth your bosco isn't uh
[6179.08s -> 6184.36s]  i'm sure he's fine i'm even gonna ask don't tell him help me finish my dimensional destabilizer
[6184.36s -> 6198.92s]  uh let's let's keep i'd be careful around that general skunk ape you too don't trust anybody do
[6198.92s -> 6204.36s]  you what do you mean by that yeah what are you trying to pull just wait till he helps me with my
[6204.36s -> 6212.09s]  inventions then you'll see he's not such a bad guy why didn't you just set up your lab in the
[6212.09s -> 6218.01s]  inconvenient store not everything happens on your street sam besides that place isn't zoned for
[6218.01s -> 6223.45s]  mixed use haunting they've got guys from the city coming by every day to evict me from this place
[6223.45s -> 6230.36s]  only way to get rid of them is by making the walls bleed how's the afterlife treating you mrs mama
[6230.36s -> 6237.88s]  bosco that's doctor mama bosco i spent the summer getting my phd online yeah i started to do that
[6237.88s -> 6243.24s]  but i kept getting distracted by all the funny cat pictures you don't know how to use computers max
[6243.24s -> 6248.20s]  what's your doctorate in mama bosco bridging the trans-dimensional gap to return spirits to
[6248.20s -> 6256.10s]  their corporeal form my masters was in funny cat pictures sounds like you're tired of being a ghost
[6256.10s -> 6260.82s]  oh it's not all bad i'm getting better at apparating and now i don't leave a trail of
[6260.82s -> 6266.50s]  ectoplasmic slime behind every time i leave the room that's better than sam can say but i'll be
[6266.50s -> 6271.22s]  glad when i finish my dimensional destabilizer and get my body back are you guys minus doing
[6271.22s -> 6274.74s]  things that i'm not saying yeah touching is my third favorite thing to do to things
[6275.46s -> 6281.82s]  uh in case anyone was curious second is licking all right
[6288.20s -> 6294.68s]  can we have a separate meter for the other guys here you're a doctor can you tell us anything
[6294.68s -> 6301.80s]  about late onset male psychic dysfunction psychic powers it's probably a melon-sized deadly tumor
[6301.80s -> 6307.56s]  probably well it could be mind worms of course but i don't want to be alarmist most likely it's
[6307.56s -> 6314.07s]  the deadly tumor couldn't max just have the perfectly safe kind of non-lethal psychic
[6314.07s -> 6320.55s]  powers oh it's max uh i'm sure it's nothing to worry about then could you uh i'm treating it
[6320.55s -> 6328.82s]  like reddit gold farther away from my machines though oh thanks for the gold are these psychic
[6328.82s -> 6335.62s]  powers dangerous for max at all well probably not if he's careful and only uses them responsibly
[6335.62s -> 6340.18s]  everything on this stream is my responsibility he'll overwork his brain so much that it catches
[6340.18s -> 6345.94s]  fire and explodes oh i have got to see that you can't see that max your brain will catch
[6345.94s -> 6353.46s]  fire and explode that's why you'll have to record it for me sam duh it is your stream after all on
[6353.46s -> 6363.69s]  the other side dr mama bosco not if i can get this destabilizer working all right so we were good
[6365.02s -> 6371.61s]  okay just mute the game every time they say a bad joke well the subtitles on you'll read it
[6375.30s -> 6381.06s]  every time they say something not funny i have to say something really funny and every time they
[6381.06s -> 6386.01s]  say something really funny i have to say something terrible so the score will even out completely
[6386.65s -> 6401.34s]  i'll work on it anything else in here are you guys ready to help us fight crime we're still on
[6401.34s -> 6408.70s]  a search for new recruits if you spot any new office equipment be sure to hook a brother up
[6409.74s -> 6413.74s]  oh wait wait wait what about the give me the jumping jumper cables neither of us knows how
[6413.74s -> 6419.90s]  to use them it's simple sam the red cable goes on the right nipple and the black cable clamps to
[6419.90s -> 6435.75s]  the other of us knows how to use them legally max i'm seeing too many plus twos for that
[6440.47s -> 6443.67s]  no i'm sorry guys i gotta bring this down that's not me i didn't do that
[6445.42s -> 6468.04s]  no no no no i'm sorry all right uh i didn't do anything yet all right the name bosco and
[6468.04s -> 6476.76s]  science go together like churches he cares too much about this all right so we two birds we got
[6476.76s -> 6485.70s]  two birds with one stone hold on air conditioner pretty cool not useful though let's put on the
[6485.70s -> 6503.62s]  3d glasses well that knocked him out cold that knocked him out cold somebody just said i i hope
[6503.62s -> 6512.86s]  his this his stream goes to minus a thousand one day what you you want me to have a really bad
[6512.86s -> 6530.06s]  stream what oh i you know it would be great if his stream was fucking terrible i can't wait till
[6530.06s -> 6539.37s]  it's awful what so i could take a bath later and like sit there crying you want me to have like
[6539.37s -> 6559.11s]  stress over like how bad my stream was no i'm not gonna sell oh my god why

[6576.66s -> 6580.74s]  this antenna is way too flimsy this is pure manipulation i don't even the score this is
[6580.74s -> 6587.94s]  this is an absolutely nullified score today absolute manipulation can i do anything with this
[6591.83s -> 6600.30s]  don't think so you guys have found out how to manipulate the market let's get it to a minus
[6600.30s -> 6615.34s]  a thousand i can manipulate it too just say i'm not i don't want to say that one i don't want to
[6615.34s -> 6659.99s]  say that word okay i got the jumper cables let's go back and do harry mole man uh turn off the chat

[8334.31s -> 8339.75s]  general just made nothing but like four to ten games so i don't know how you guys feel about that
[8339.75s -> 8362.95s]  but okay what you can tell we're running low you can tell we're running low any idea when you'll

[10650.42s -> 10655.78s]  assume that he's going to cut out your brain and keep it in a jar i guess we're just not
[10655.78s -> 10662.34s]  that cynical to be fair max your future vision goggles did tip us off you mean you wield the
[10662.34s -> 10671.67s]  eyes of yogg-zagoth but but that must mean you also have the gift is is max is gonna end up being
[10672.55s -> 10681.14s]  yogg-zagoth right something like that i could see that happening in the future you seem to
[10681.14s -> 10687.78s]  know all about max's psychic powers yes max is one with the gift the toys have great power but
[10687.78s -> 10693.78s]  only to those of us with a special brain well max does have a special brain that's what all the
[10693.78s -> 10700.74s]  teachers said well that and back back i cast the out demon you must use the gift wisely max and
[10700.74s -> 10707.70s]  keep it secret from general scone cafe the power is every bit as dangerous as it is wicked awesome
[10709.56s -> 10716.44s]  okay so where the what's that more processing room all about isn't it obvious general scone cafe
[10716.44s -> 10724.36s]  is illegally harvesting mold juice old juice it's the it's blood they they they're mammals there's
[10724.36s -> 10734.73s]  blood this is just okay what is skunk ape's evil scheme anyhow no less than domination of the entire
[10734.73s -> 10741.69s]  universe did he ever mention anything more specific he's traveling from planet to planet
[10741.69s -> 10747.53s]  searching for all the toys of power if he ever manages to collect all of them he'll be completely
[10747.53s -> 10756.10s]  unstoppable mammals not the only thing with blood yeah but i mean like a mole is a mammal they just
[10756.10s -> 10765.16s]  have red blood they have like human blood moles cows dogs humans they all have blood they all
[10765.16s -> 10772.74s]  have human blood we all have the same blood why did skunk ape come here to our street he's been
[10772.74s -> 10779.14s]  using my strange psychic connection to the toys of power to track them throughout the galaxy
[10779.14s -> 10785.70s]  something very powerful pulled me to this spot i can only guess it was max's discovery of the
[10785.70s -> 10795.22s]  eyes of yog sagoth and the future vision what's your story brain can we get you anything like a
[10795.22s -> 10801.78s]  spine no it's too late for me i'm afraid i can only help you put a stop to general scone cafe's
[10801.78s -> 10807.70s]  evil schemes by controlling the doors and the higher functions of this spaceship we must work
[10807.70s -> 10815.46s]  quickly before what is in this broth is that oregano it's delightful stay focused pal it's
[10815.46s -> 10822.34s]  demon broth okay i think i got it how did you get here i have found a mysterious toy and was using
[10822.34s -> 10829.46s]  my strange power over it to amaze and delight the ladies of my village it was then that scone cafe's
[10829.46s -> 10835.62s]  ship landed he was intrigued with my power and invited me on board his spaceship so you just
[10835.62s -> 10842.26s]  went with him he said he had candy how is i supposed to know he'd imprisoned me here forcing me to use
[10842.26s -> 10849.83s]  my psychic powers against my will okay where's your body what did you look like back when you
[10849.83s -> 10856.87s]  had a body oh nothing exceptional about 63 raven hair i had what you earthlings call a runner's
[10856.87s -> 10863.27s]  build i can read minds in the future you know all right fine i believe the closest creature you have
[10863.27s -> 10871.64s]  on your planet is called a platypus okay why are we supposed to stop scone cape any weaknesses like
[10871.64s -> 10877.00s]  he's powerless against the color yellow or he can't cross running water or he's powerless against
[10877.00s -> 10883.40s]  yellow water i know what you're thinking max and stop it well of course the toys of power are useless
[10883.40s -> 10888.52s]  to him without a gifted brain to control them so he doesn't have a different brand he always says
[10888.52s -> 10893.88s]  he has a weakness for potato chips and he has to eat the whole bag yeah that doesn't really help us
[10893.88s -> 10902.57s]  much sometimes when he's in the shower i could swear i hear him crying why do you think max's
[10902.57s -> 10907.93s]  powers are dangerous apart from the obvious of course general scone cafe can't use the
[10907.93s -> 10914.73s]  toys of power himself so he needs the brain of someone who has the gift he forced me to use my
[10914.73s -> 10921.69s]  power so much that i would have died had you not rescued me if he ever found out you have the gift
[10921.69s -> 10930.63s]  max he wouldn't hesitate to do the same to you okay that's all the evidence we need let's go out
[10930.63s -> 10936.39s]  and deliver some interplanetary justice max if you end up cutting out his brain i call dibs on
[10936.39s -> 10943.14s]  scone cafe's body yeah this is like this is the bad guy probably okay so now we gotta go
[10945.16s -> 10952.65s]  and we have a scanner and i somehow just clicked out of the window i don't know how that happened
[10952.65s -> 10968.94s]  play just dance spaceship is secure if i could have a moment sirs hello sam mr president if you
[10968.94s -> 10974.46s]  have a moment you need to be debriefed too late this may come as a shock but our intel indicates
[10974.46s -> 10984.68s]  that general scone cafe is actually quite evil no i'm pretty sure i never heard of a department
[10984.68s -> 10990.44s]  of home world security agent super ball established in 1901 by theodore roosevelt after president
[10990.44s -> 10995.24s]  mckinley's assassination by one of the insect doors of the nebulon empire i'm president of
[10995.24s -> 11000.52s]  the united states why didn't i hear anything about it it's explained in books sir all right
[11000.52s -> 11007.29s]  the other fucking 30 viruses i have they'll all eat each other until there's one that remains and
[11007.29s -> 11012.17s]  then i'll just remove that with a fucking fucking c cleaner is that why you were hanging out in
[11012.17s -> 11019.29s]  our office so much last season i mean a few months ago to protect max um sure wow i feel
[11019.29s -> 11035.54s]  really close to you right now agent super ball likewise sir a bit too close okay what's the real
[11035.54s -> 11040.74s]  story behind skunk ape general skunk cafe is an intergalactic criminal warlord there's been a
[11040.74s -> 11045.54s]  galaxy-wide gorilla haunted effect ever since he escaped from the penal zone oh i didn't talk
[11045.54s -> 11048.74s]  about the thing that i want to do it's an interdimensional prison for the most dangerous
[11048.74s -> 11053.46s]  villains in the universe are we supposed to get skunk ape back into the penal zone the united
[11053.46s -> 11057.62s]  planets have simple and easily reproducible failsafe measures in place to handle escape
[11057.62s -> 11062.98s]  convicts well that's a relief all we need to do is open an unstable transdimensional gateway to
[11062.98s -> 11068.02s]  the penal zone and his prisoner's badge will take care of the rest didn't they do this schtick before
[11068.10s -> 11074.26s]  a couple times where you you you do the end of the game and then they do go back and do everything
[11074.26s -> 11079.78s]  before the end of the game like they hey this is that very end and but now do the whole thing
[11079.78s -> 11084.74s]  they've done it like two or three times uh but anyways i was in the recommended channel a few
[11084.74s -> 11092.26s]  days ago and i saw an idea that looked really really funny i believe it was vr josh that had
[11092.26s -> 11099.38s]  this idea so you know whoever else contributed to it like props props to you um do you remember
[11099.38s -> 11106.12s]  when last week i showed that video and in the video the person it was somebody's music video
[11106.12s -> 11113.75s]  and they had hidden me in like a part of the tree if you weren't there but if you were there you'll
[11113.75s -> 11120.15s]  know so they hid me in a part like in one frame of a video and they were saying oh look you're
[11120.15s -> 11128.02s]  in this video and we couldn't find it so what the recommendation said wouldn't it be fun potentially
[11128.74s -> 11136.20s]  if i did a whole stream where it was just where's waldo people would submit images that i would get
[11136.20s -> 11145.22s]  to have a magnifying glass and try to find where they'd put me in the image i feel like it would
[11145.22s -> 11153.56s]  be pretty fun i get to have the only criteria is obviously there has to be it's going to be
[11153.56s -> 11161.10s]  completely vetted um so i get to have that little microsoft magnifying glass that's the
[11161.10s -> 11165.42s]  only thing i get and i have to stay a certain amount of uh feet from the screen so i can't
[11165.42s -> 11170.30s]  like lean the fuck in like this no i have to be sitting back here we'll have something to make
[11170.30s -> 11175.26s]  it so like i'll bump into it if i lean forward and i just get the microsoft magnifying glass
[11177.53s -> 11180.57s]  and people can submit it and put me obviously in places wherever they want
[11181.53s -> 11190.54s]  there'll be a lot of hidden memes that's where i have to be careful though because
[11191.50s -> 11201.22s]  they got to be really like cleanly vetted and if you put something fucked up in there
[11202.89s -> 11220.36s]  you're out like yeah like a like a hidden object game when am i going to do it i mean this was
[11220.36s -> 11226.25s]  just a random idea and i thought it was interesting so i would assume if it's something that i'll talk
[11226.25s -> 11232.46s]  to the mods about it and maybe we'll get a plan and then we'll open up obviously potential like
[11232.46s -> 11237.02s]  submissions i didn't notice skunk ape wearing any kind of badge or a homing beacon that's because
[11237.02s -> 11242.46s]  he wasn't wearing one sir i find it extraordinarily alarming whoa whoa whoa whoa calm down you can't
[11242.46s -> 11247.10s]  think with all your hysterics forgive me mr president but unless you can find general skunk
[11247.10s -> 11252.92s]  ape's homing beacon and place it on him we're powerless to stop him there'd have to be rules
[11254.38s -> 11258.30s]  where i would have to be a certain amount of pixels you can't just make me one pixel
[11258.30s -> 11266.94s]  and put me there no no no i have to it has to be solvable i can't be impossible what did this
[11266.94s -> 11271.66s]  homing beacon look like it's a standard issue intergalactic correctional facility in mate's
[11271.66s -> 11276.06s]  badge it can't be destroyed so the only way he could have gotten rid of it is by giving it to
[11276.06s -> 11283.74s]  someone else oh it would be a decent idea is to have a channel for this right at all right i i
[11283.74s -> 11291.66s]  just figured it out so to avoid like hey look i put a like little dick on the screen that you're
[11291.66s -> 11295.66s]  going to scroll over with the magnifying glass and it's going to be hard to like you know go through
[11295.66s -> 11300.38s]  it and screen it all and oh look you scrolled over the dick on on screen oh that's funny
[11301.10s -> 11306.38s]  to make sure that doesn't happen maybe have a chat in the discord open to have like ideas
[11306.94s -> 11310.86s]  and like designated people actually put it in the image you know what i'm saying
[11313.85s -> 11325.22s]  that's probably better a group effort where like only a dozen people have the key i think that's
[11325.22s -> 11330.90s]  pretty good yeah we have to open an unstable trans-dimensional gateway you must have lost
[11330.90s -> 11335.38s]  your senses man the odds against that are astronomical even if we didn't know what that
[11335.38s -> 11341.06s]  was the gateway is the easy part sirs dr mama boscow's reckless and blasphemous work tearing
[11341.06s -> 11348.12s]  down the fabric of reality could be useful that'd be fun give me the key give me the key
[11352.36s -> 11357.88s]  a school group project where one guy does all the work her dimensional destabilizer can open
[11357.88s -> 11362.28s]  a gateway to the penal zone anyone wearing a prisoner's homing beacon will be returned to
[11362.28s -> 11368.14s]  justice automatically and scientifically okay so we need to hope we need the homing beacon
[11369.18s -> 11373.66s]  we've got to throw it on a scungate back we can't track him without his homing beacon sir
[11373.66s -> 11377.74s]  this will require some traditional detective work all right what's reckless and irrational
[11377.74s -> 11382.86s]  detective work do because that's all we know i'd recommend starting with some of his known contacts
[11384.63s -> 11391.11s]  mama boscow what do we need from mama boscow her dimensional destabilizer can open a gateway to
[11391.11s -> 11395.35s]  the penal zone anyone wearing a prisoner's homing beacon will be returned to justice
[11395.35s -> 11403.66s]  automatically and scientifically all right let's go don't worry super ball we'll hit that gorilla
[11403.66s -> 11419.42s]  where it hurts the most right in the penal zone i get it sir okay wait nothing else with you
[11419.98s -> 11424.78s]  okay well give me the other uh the other item can i get this or do i have to open it or something
[11424.78s -> 11433.22s]  later max this unassuming telephone unlocks the gift of teleportation
[11435.14s -> 11442.41s]  using the power of your mind you can teleport yourself to any phone number you have memorized
[11443.29s -> 11448.89s]  oh boy i want to try it right now all right let's talk what's on of you teleporting off without me
[11449.61s -> 11458.92s]  you can go too sam max will teleport anyone he's touching watch the hands okay
[11459.72s -> 11473.38s]  where do i want to go stinky cell boscow tech civils let's get let's go into stinky cell
[11474.18s -> 11492.95s]  enjoying the ride sam i don't know it's so scary he's made it red
[11495.19s -> 11510.22s]  note to self when traveling through max's brain keep your eyes shut uh-oh my phone just started
[11510.22s -> 11518.66s]  somebody actually just texted me right now that happened that was weird it's stinky cell phone
[11518.66s -> 11524.10s]  but why would she have left it behind especially since she's got 18 months left on her contract
[11524.10s -> 11528.50s]  either there was some kind of struggle or it was left here for us to find and we're walking right
[11528.50s -> 11533.86s]  into a trap i got it she waived her early cancellation fees with a recommended device
[11533.86s -> 11538.82s]  upgrade just happened so now we know two things you're an idiot and this phone is going to lead
[11538.82s -> 11552.76s]  us directly to general skunking somehow what the fuck i can't win well now i have the phone
[11553.72s -> 11560.78s]  i got the phone the scanner the warrant what else do i need to find carmen san diego
[11561.66s -> 11594.14s]  let's teleport somewhere was that a cow civil where's her phone shouldn't i have been appeared
[11594.14s -> 11602.10s]  in the box all right we gotta go we gotta i got a scanner what's this it's one of those obsolete
[11602.10s -> 11609.83s]  all-in-one scanner fax copier juice maker machines can't interact with the rats have already tried
[11612.15s -> 11616.79s]  nothing in the boxes a good thing civil packed all our junk into these boxes for safe keeping
[11616.79s -> 11621.19s]  and i'm especially glad we didn't put it in a secure environmentally regulated storage facility
[11621.19s -> 11625.59s]  like she asked us to yeah this way's a lot cheaper and everybody gets to enjoy it
[11626.71s -> 11645.94s]  and then back there phones light up again uh hold on what about the phone in here are you guys still
[11645.94s -> 11651.22s]  looking for a fourth member well hello there beautiful were your moving parts properly
[11651.22s -> 11659.46s]  secured when you fell from heaven do not forget our seminar on workplace harassment
[11659.46s -> 11665.22s]  plus i called dibs when exactly did this get really creepy thank you for joining us in a
[11665.22s -> 11670.10s]  brand new style of 20th century crime play you can begin submitting clues to the crime
[11670.10s -> 11675.70s]  drawn whenever you find them i do have ideas on the case cops we're sorry we haven't been
[11675.70s -> 11681.86s]  paying attention i got a phone and evidence with the crime hyphen tron and we will track
[11681.86s -> 11690.54s]  down the villains without mercy am i angry angry what no it's because i'm in like a blue room
[11690.54s -> 11695.96s]  and i probably look menacing i don't want to toss this thing around i might break it
[11699.08s -> 11704.76s]  i'm inside of like the hold on i better keep this note there could be valuable information on it
[11704.76s -> 11712.95s]  that's not evidence wait the phone and this this is not evidence i better keep this note
[11712.95s -> 11717.69s]  there could be valuable information on it it looks like you're using the crime tron
[11718.25s -> 11724.60s]  would you like help uh sure i keep it short place any two pieces of evidence
[11724.60s -> 11730.36s]  two pieces of evidence excel multi-scanner if a piece of evidence is found on our database
[11730.36s -> 11738.76s]  you'll hear this noise if we cannot recognize a piece you'll hear this after two items are inserted
[11738.76s -> 11745.32s]  our exclusive clue match technology will scan for possible connections advanced data analysis
[11745.32s -> 11752.92s]  algorithms will compare the evidence against our 64kb database set up to one two calculations per
[11752.92s -> 11759.72s]  second you're not helping it's really not all that complicated i can also help organize your
[11759.72s -> 11765.16s]  compact disk collection if the crime tron can find the connection between the two pieces of
[11765.16s -> 11776.60s]  evidence then you get yourself a new location on your map yeah let's go item not found in database
[11779.40s -> 11785.91s]  really if stinky went somewhere to meet skunk eight she's probably got the number of a place on speed
[11785.91s -> 11798.86s]  dial that don't work so if stinky went somewhere to meet skunk okay she's probably got the number
[11798.86s -> 11813.38s]  of a place on speed dial so this is not it item not recognized come on i need another piece of
[11813.38s -> 11821.27s]  evidence i need the phone but the phone number is on there do we need two phones all right those
[11821.27s -> 11827.61s]  don't work so i need something else what do you mean wait wait what are you talking about this is
[11827.61s -> 11840.23s]  my gun if stinky went somewhere to meet skunking she's probably got the number of my gun so that's
[11840.23s -> 11845.27s]  not it general skunk it could be anywhere in the city he could have at least left the forwarding
[11845.27s -> 11854.01s]  address or phone number i don't i really it's the note flint paper found from the mysterious
[11854.01s -> 11862.89s]  mister s to stinky that number and then the phone i don't want to use up stinky's minutes
[11862.89s -> 11868.17s]  what's in it sam you don't know how to turn it on god wanted us to use cell phones he wouldn't have
[11868.17s -> 11876.22s]  invented another piece of evidence that i need to find i can't use it it's stinky's newfangled
[11876.30s -> 11888.63s]  cellular telephone yeah that's it all right shoot the phone it's been months and they still haven't
[11888.63s -> 11895.86s]  i say we all wear gray ribbons to raise crack awareness put the stream on my other monitor

[11943.85s -> 11954.79s]  be anywhere in the city he could have at least left the phone number can i go in the mole processing
[11954.79s -> 11960.23s]  center hey brain can you open this door for us you want to go into the mole processing room but
[11960.23s -> 11967.83s]  it's a horrible place official business besides it's for mole people only perfect we're part mole

[12939.21s -> 12944.14s]  because she got a torn up seat for something but skunk must have dropped it when he came through
[12944.14s -> 12949.58s]  here a clue i didn't think about store i didn't think that now from half a receipt little buddy
[12949.58s -> 12953.26s]  this looks like a job for all right we got a receipt crime tron receipt in the ring
[12954.30s -> 12961.19s]  all right let me see one of skunk ape's minions left behind this torn receipt from it
[12961.19s -> 12972.02s]  what does it say on it paddle paddle ball what else is in here can i use this phone
[12972.74s -> 12978.97s]  hello operator oops sorry you know how those spirits are once they get talking
[12978.97s -> 12983.69s]  about the good old days when they were alive i guess we can't make outgoing calls let's go
[12983.69s -> 12994.71s]  talk to mama vasco i yeah mama vasco what's going on here mama vasco help
[12994.71s -> 13001.32s]  thanks for getting rid of those gorillas sam and max all right what does that dimensional
[13001.32s -> 13007.24s]  destabilizer do exactly it opens a temporary gateway between one dimension and the next
[13007.24s -> 13012.28s]  which can pull someone from the spirit world into the real world or from the real world to
[13012.28s -> 13018.04s]  an interdimensional prison i suppose so we need that do you think that's what skunk ape was trying
[13018.04s -> 13022.68s]  to keep people from finding i don't know my money's still on the big screen thing that's
[13022.68s -> 13028.12s]  just cool well it's worth a try i built a remote control so you can open the gateway
[13028.12s -> 13033.32s]  anywhere it'll only stay open a few minutes so you've got to make sure you do it right
[13033.32s -> 13037.72s]  anybody holding something tuned to the alternate dimension will get sucked right in
[13039.16s -> 13046.41s]  okay max is confused about how that dimensional destabilizer works you just have to find skunk
[13046.97s -> 13051.37s]  and open up the gateway if he's holding anything tuned to that dimension he'll get sucked in
[13051.37s -> 13056.97s]  sucked right in the remote control for it is right over there get the remote he needs to have
[13056.97s -> 13062.57s]  something that is tuned to the second dimension they came in and took over the place right after
[13062.57s -> 13069.37s]  i told him about my dimensional destabilizer well that was uncalled for yeah i mean sure she's
[13069.37s -> 13074.81s]  really boring about it but that's no excuse for violence i'm pretty sure he was trying to keep
[13074.81s -> 13089.93s]  anybody from using my inventions against him don't make me do it did skunk ape give you any
[13089.93s -> 13095.13s]  idea what he's got planned nope he just told his guards to make sure nobody found out about my
[13095.13s -> 13112.70s]  inventions let's get on the other side dr mama bosco i'm not gonna do it again don't worry i'm
[13112.70s -> 13120.39s]  just kidding that's what i want you to think okay so let me get the remote thank you i have the
[13120.39s -> 13125.99s]  remote is this the remote control for your destabilizer thing mama bosco that's the one
[13126.07s -> 13130.55s]  make sure you don't press it before you really need to because you only get one chance
[13132.17s -> 13151.24s]  i'll fix the light don't worry too bright um two xbox i feel like i'm at an xbox booth
[13151.24s -> 13158.09s]  at fucking like packs uh no that's fine no that's like i look like i'm looking i look sick
[13165.58s -> 13179.80s]  no it's too bright that's better okay that's better dude twitch purple no i'm not gonna
[13179.80s -> 13185.08s]  twitch purple i can't even do purple it's a color that like somehow doesn't really work that well
[13185.08s -> 13195.26s]  all right so i got the remote i now need to put this on him we need to get the thing we need to
[13195.26s -> 13210.28s]  do the receipt and the ring i'm rolling now why am i from boston because my two my two parents
[13210.28s -> 13220.87s]  decided that they were going to live there and then they had me as a child what else do you want
[13227.50s -> 13230.78s]  all right got this ring from somewhere but the engraving just says
[13230.78s -> 13239.69s]  hard luck nothing how is that nothing that's a receipt in a ring it's not the receipt for the
[13239.69s -> 13288.65s]  ring is it a cell phone bill if stinky went somewhere to meet skunk shit general skunk it
[13288.65s -> 13292.73s]  could be anywhere in the city he could have at least left a forwarding address or a phone number
[13298.42s -> 13304.92s]  damn it i thought that was gonna be it do you think we have what it takes to join the skunk ape army
[13304.92s -> 13309.00s]  i think you could use a good stomach workout sam lose weight the stinky way
[13309.56s -> 13312.12s]  urging does tighten up those abs i'll give you that
[13315.18s -> 13319.74s]  civil sent us a postcard she and the giant stone head of abraham lincoln are still on their
[13319.74s -> 13325.18s]  extended honeymoon and you said their marriage wouldn't last actually i said it was a violation
[13325.18s -> 13332.58s]  of the laws of nature and most major religions automatically see you max keep in touch
[13333.72s -> 13342.34s]  we where would i find so this is one of skunk ape's minions left behind this torn receipt for a
[13342.34s -> 13350.89s]  toy store this is the note this is the phone this is the ring this is the just turn it off what
[13350.89s -> 13367.46s]  happens when you don't want to use that until skunk ape is nearby you can't hear me is there
[13367.46s -> 13372.82s]  can i is there anywhere else i can go general skunk it could be anywhere in the city he could
[13372.82s -> 13378.95s]  have at least left the forwarding address my mic is not muted i can see it right here
[13380.18s -> 13384.02s]  literally i'm not going to sniff the webcam either so like get that out of your vocabulary
[13392.54s -> 13404.49s]  what else am i missing i feel like it's something to do with the the liquidation machine
[13405.29s -> 13428.90s]  can i like shut down the liquidation machine let auto sniff the camera no autos in bed
[13432.57s -> 13442.78s]  put the cam on your head like a gopro how am i going to hold it there am i missing something
[13442.78s -> 13454.71s]  in here anything at all should i like turn this on so you're suggesting we trap skunk
[13454.71s -> 13459.67s]  ape in our own building well kind of you'd actually be turning your building into an
[13459.67s -> 13467.27s]  alternate dimension so it won't really exist anymore how do we get into our building got to
[13467.27s -> 13483.06s]  get okay we're gonna get into our building teleportation stick it to the grease on your
[13483.06s -> 13499.58s]  forehead just ban that person for life please i hope they finish the repair work on our building
[13499.58s -> 13505.02s]  soon i miss taking showers we could just give ourselves tongue baths like cats and flight
[13505.02s -> 13510.22s]  attendants do well they're okay i guess just be careful around the back of my neck that's
[13510.22s -> 13515.90s]  where i'm most probably healthy skin that means i'm healthy that means i'm very moist i have lots
[13515.90s -> 13539.03s]  of collagen i've got lots of elasticity i'm very moisturized i think gee little buddy here in 2109
[13539.11s -> 13548.92s]  our street looks pretty much no no no no no max no not the chrysler building that sounds fun i
[13548.92s -> 13561.86s]  can hardly wait what the fuck are you talking about biting my lip again thinking too hard
[13562.74s -> 13581.18s]  all right i'm very obviously missing something important what am i missing where have i not been
[13581.18s -> 13590.87s]  i haven't been down here in a while i haven't been down here in a while yeah let's just see
[13590.87s -> 13604.09s]  see general skunk it could be anywhere in the city he could have at least left a forwarding
[13604.09s -> 13614.73s]  address or a phone number you could be anywhere in the city rosemary keeps wandering off and
[13614.73s -> 13623.35s]  leaving this thing behind we've already seen this anything at all any wait wait wait wait wait wait
[13623.35s -> 13631.40s]  wait there's nobody there anymore as much as i'd love to get over there i'm not quite willing to
[13631.40s -> 13639.06s]  swim through the muck come on can i go in the hole and then walk down this way no i can't cross
[13639.06s -> 13645.14s]  the the game uh cartridges i don't think that can come down here but i can't go this way

[13653.18s -> 13672.87s]  let me look at the future future oh that's unpleasant well now i just want to know how
[13672.87s -> 13677.19s]  we get over there how do i get in there too knowing us it's probably something clever but
[13677.19s -> 13688.01s]  overly complicated probably you're not gonna know how we get over there
[13688.01s -> 13697.35s]  me too that's all i'm gonna get that we eventually just come out wouldn't you like to know
[13697.35s -> 13713.02s]  next train wouldn't you like to know so i obviously have to all right there's only two holes
[13714.46s -> 13718.70s]  general skunk it could be anywhere in the city he could have at least left a forwarding address
[13718.70s -> 13725.43s]  or a phone number let's go teleport to but he didn't want to go into that hole the hole in

[13794.68s -> 13800.44s]  it's gotta be something with this thing it's too complicated i thought that was it i thought i

[15984.20s -> 15991.08s]  to its inevitable conclusion no longer can you blindly mash buttons to unleash a torrent of
[15991.08s -> 15998.12s]  irreverent banter and comic mischief now you are all that stands in the way of the total annihilation
[15998.12s -> 16005.72s]  of the planet earth the villain has made his move the players are yours to command only you can

[16107.13s -> 16113.85s]  can you call for help on your fancy futuristic phone i already tried that when you guys were
[16113.85s -> 16118.89s]  knocked out there's no signal off this spaceship no signal but throw that phone
[16119.93s -> 16124.41s]  throw that phone out there so we can teleport out of the cell yeah isn't skunk ape your boyfriend
[16124.41s -> 16131.85s]  you he wishes he is so not my type you only have to date an evil gorilla once to learn never to make
[16131.85s -> 16141.64s]  that mistake again just slide it up there and we'll teleport out what are we doing here how is this
[16141.64s -> 16147.24s]  grandpa stinky's fault he's been going on and on about skunk copy ever since he landed
[16147.24s -> 16150.52s]  that's the kind of gentleman you should get involved with he's got a future
[16152.20s -> 16158.20s]  how about skunk ape's the jerk stay away from skunk ape the guy's a total butthorn
[16158.20s -> 16162.52s]  you're telling me i was just going to meet my to meet a friend at the top of the empire state
[16162.52s -> 16167.16s]  building then all of a sudden this giant gorilla shows up and carries me off to be his queen or
[16167.16s -> 16171.88s]  something gee you think a hyper intelligent alien could have come up with something more original
[16171.96s -> 16175.64s]  i'm not buying this super advanced technology business if they haven't even mastered the
[16175.64s -> 16180.36s]  technique of margaritas and unexpected car trouble you know i don't think i've ever had
[16180.36s -> 16185.16s]  a margarita before in my whole life i think you're being too hard on skunk ape he's just
[16185.16s -> 16192.76s]  misunderstood oh yeah uh did i misunderstand this picture he sent me good heavens i think i should
[16192.76s -> 16200.30s]  put on some clothes now well skunk ape's got a lot of good points too name one he's got a couple of
[16200.30s -> 16206.22s]  good qualities he's got he's got his own spaceship i noticed that may impress you boys but the keys
[16206.22s -> 16210.94s]  to your cage so he could let you out but then she wouldn't be able to talk to us anymore
[16214.87s -> 16227.72s]  you general skunk ape we're all set max now we just got to get out of this cage so we can wrap this
[16227.72s -> 16255.54s]  case up reading take that die earthlings die game let's go plan well done freelance police now you
[16255.54s -> 16263.54s]  must place the homing beacon on skunk ape's back to trap him in the peel zone we're on it now light
[16263.54s -> 16272.92s]  up those toys the hell looking for these oh he looked through his 3d glasses and saw the
[16272.92s -> 16283.18s]  future has proven to be most enlightening here use it to witness how i'm going to destroy you
[16284.62s -> 16292.54s]  so what was that plan b again i believe you planned to turn on the dimensional destabilizer yes
[16293.50s -> 16299.58s]  luckily i have my own but i've still got the homing beacon exactly
[16310.79s -> 16316.71s]  can you believe that guy skunk ape knew what we were going to do the whole time he just wanted
[16316.71s -> 16322.87s]  to rub our noses in the penal zone from software end game level what do we do you're not supposed
[16322.95s -> 16328.39s]  to max it's a horrible plane of non-existence forever trapped between reality and unreality
[16328.39s -> 16336.17s]  yeah that and also that beeping noise is really getting on my nerves turn around max skunk ape
[16336.17s -> 16346.60s]  strapped an antimatter bomb on your back while we were out cold get rid of it what does it say
[16347.56s -> 16351.08s]  jeez what a jerk we've got to get out of here max pronto
[16353.59s -> 16362.02s]  we if i know my high tech futuristic explosive devices this is an anti-matter bomb that will
[16362.02s -> 16367.38s]  destroy the entire penal zone and anyone inside it and it's going to go off at any second really
[16367.38s -> 16378.46s]  sam any second well maybe i'm exaggerating hours but still best not to dawdle how did you land how
[16378.46s -> 16383.35s]  are you up there all right what do i do i have whatever items i got the paddle i've got the
[16383.35s -> 16389.29s]  homing beacon i got the shock glass you know unless you might as well what else is even over
[16389.29s -> 16403.99s]  here anything let's put the homing beacon onto the the explosive no let's not put the homing
[16403.99s -> 16408.39s]  beacon on the explosive all right that's not the right thing to do shock last i'd better keep this
[16408.39s -> 16415.70s]  it could be an important clue in our case how about um can i tell can i do i still have a
[16415.70s -> 16421.14s]  teleporter oh shit he didn't take wait wait hold on wait what about the future button
[16424.46s -> 16466.68s]  i thought he wouldn't wait i guess he didn't take it i just come back gotcha
[16468.66s -> 16475.22s]  welcome back sirs uh what just happened i detected a spike in antimatter radiation
[16475.22s -> 16479.86s]  so i locked onto the signal from your homing beacon and reversed the polarity of the dimensional
[16479.86s -> 16484.26s]  stabilization field to intercept yeah yeah just tell us how we can get back at skunk ape for crimes
[16484.26s -> 16489.62s]  against the freelance police and humanity i say let's cover him in candy bar wrappers and feed
[16489.62s -> 16496.26s]  him to starving raccoons you failed to trap him in the penal zone i wouldn't say failed exactly uh
[16496.26s -> 16503.70s]  maybe underperformed and we blew up the penal zone with an anti-matter bomb oh dear how can i help
[16503.70s -> 16508.10s]  sam and max doctor mama bosko has been granted the fullest security clearance possible for a
[16508.10s -> 16515.40s]  dead citizen mr president okay can't we just use that destabilizer thing to open up another
[16515.40s -> 16522.87s]  gateway not now that the penal zone has been destroyed how are we going to stop skunk now
[16522.87s -> 16528.79s]  with the penal zone destroyed we have no way to return him to prison unless you could make
[16528.79s -> 16535.43s]  another penal zone somewhere else i smell a convoluted plan coming on with a side order
[16535.43s -> 16541.43s]  of hand-waving technical nonsense extra crispy before i made the destabilizer i was working on
[16541.43s -> 16545.91s]  a dimensional rift generator it doesn't open a gateway to another dimension it actually
[16545.91s -> 16551.35s]  creates another dimension only problem is you'll have to find a nexus of ley lines somewhere for
[16551.35s -> 16556.07s]  it to work a place where the border between reality and nonsense has broken down there is
[16556.07s -> 16560.95s]  there happens to be one of those in the city man it's a 1313 straight street i was gonna say
[16560.95s -> 16569.99s]  address sounds familiar that's our building what if i put my minecraft bed okay how does this
[16569.99s -> 16575.27s]  rift generator work you just plug it in and press the pedal after that it works just like the
[16575.27s -> 16581.35s]  destabilizer if skunkope is wearing that homing beacon he'll get pulled into the new dimension
[16581.35s -> 16587.59s]  the trick is finding enough power do you have any more of those power cores lying around no i
[16587.59s -> 16592.23s]  never did get that back but even so it would have taken a hundred of those things to give enough
[16592.23s -> 16596.87s]  power to a dimensional rift generator it's over there with the other inventions that are a deadly
[16596.87s -> 16604.84s]  radiation hazard so you're suggesting we trap skunk ape in our own building well kind of you'd
[16604.84s -> 16610.36s]  actually be turning your building into an alternate dimension so it won't really exist anymore i'm
[16610.36s -> 16615.64s]  afraid it's the only way sirs and the plus side if it doesn't exist think of how much money we'll
[16615.64s -> 16622.74s]  save on rent we don't pay rent max can't we just use that destabilizer thing to open up another
[16622.74s -> 16627.62s]  gateway not now that the penal zone has been destroyed you'll have to use mama bosko's rift
[16627.62s -> 16634.95s]  generator to create a new penal zone see on the other side dr mama bosko we're doing a whole lot
[16634.95s -> 16640.55s]  of this today like put your fucking hands you know what's because there's a lot of breaks in
[16640.55s -> 16644.87s]  between using your hands in the game so i just i like moving around like a fucking magician
[16645.67s -> 16652.54s]  because i only need one hand to play this right we'll be careful with your rift generator mama
[16652.54s -> 16656.94s]  bosko just make sure you don't turn it on until you've got that homing beacon on general skunk
[16656.94s -> 16682.01s]  ape the fuck happened here it's like this is like i don't want no i don't want i don't want to
[16683.37s -> 16689.10s]  i don't want you to see what's under here guys my mother's that person that puts our name and
[16689.10s -> 16695.74s]  address as a fucking tag on everything that we own i can't help it on all of my nintendo games
[16695.74s -> 16713.53s]  on all of my fucking uh electronics i i don't just look what happened it's mama bosko's
[16713.53s -> 16722.58s]  dimensional destabilizer thing all right so i gotta do i got this thing gotta plug it in
[16722.58s -> 16731.30s]  turn it on bye guys i'll see you when i fix the fucking universe
[16732.18s -> 16755.30s]  we eat the rubber we're sorry we're not driving anywhere with that space gorilla on the loose
[16755.30s -> 16760.42s]  i just want to scan some data just teleport there if you're in such a day hurry to get yourself
[16760.42s -> 16768.01s]  killed all right well so i need to plug this into a power source and we got to go to the
[16768.01s -> 16774.25s]  interdimensional rift that's right outside the just go to sybil's and there's the
[16775.21s -> 16787.51s]  the rift there i just plug it into there what do we do now sam i don't know the powers out in
[16787.51s -> 16799.85s]  the whole building i know where to go do i'm doing
[16799.85s -> 16803.61s]  fighting
[16821.00s -> 16829.43s]  i actually have to dodge this stuff get him to blow so get him to explode something blow this up
[16832.76s -> 16838.55s]  got to get this homing beacon onto general skunky before we get accidentally incarcerated
[16838.55s -> 16867.35s]  out too and take this out too take this out bingo get in gee simple stuff is okay you live on our
[16867.35s -> 16871.59s]  street there's a good chance you're gonna get blown up she should understand that by now sam
[16873.21s -> 16879.93s]  whoa all right now the eyes there's gonna be a power source down here that he's gonna be able
[16879.93s -> 16897.16s]  to shoot through the crack down to the power source plug it in we go over here i can teleport
[16897.16s -> 16919.19s]  to the phone now just in case everybody was curious about what to do next all right then
[16919.19s -> 16924.31s]  ah i was hoping we teleport under an immovable pile of rubble and debris trapped for weeks we'd
[16924.31s -> 16929.91s]  be forced to resort to cannibalism just to survive you keep coming up with creepy disaster scenarios
[16929.91s -> 16935.11s]  that always end up with you eating me max it's getting annoying if you don't like it then stop
[16935.11s -> 16939.75s]  looking so damn tasty can you link me to the watcher you're reading yeah it's uh pc gaming
[16939.75s -> 16945.43s]  strategy it's a good thing civil packed all our junk into these boxes for safe keeping upstairs
[16946.39s -> 16984.66s]  can i go let's go in a mysterious town we're trying to save the planet here damn intruders
[16984.66s -> 16992.82s]  they've come to defile the toy box kill them no it's kind of cool brother look it is the dog and
[16992.82s -> 17002.10s]  rabbit justice prophesied on tablet 8 verse 32 uh excuse me i'm pretty sure you mean tablet 6
[17002.10s -> 17009.78s]  verse 24 heretic looks like another in a long line of wacky cults max we're in so many prophecies
[17009.78s -> 17014.74s]  we should start charging royalties you try and entertain the other wingnuts while i find a way
[17014.74s -> 17026.70s]  to power this thing up so the moles are an ancient group of old beings
[17031.75s -> 17039.91s]  who that's the most evil looking toy chest i've ever seen no doubt it'd unleash all kinds of
[17039.91s -> 17046.15s]  horrors if we ever opened it harry is it'll scrounge up some blasting caps no you mustn't
[17046.15s -> 17051.99s]  open it that would give general skunk up a unimaginable power to destroy us all
[17053.03s -> 17061.11s]  they're right pal we better get rid of skunk ape first all right well plug it in cable the workers
[17061.11s -> 17065.35s]  left some of the cable exposed when they were busy not fixing the power right in here right
[17066.92s -> 17086.38s]  yeah let's go plug the power cable into the boiler there's no place on the toy box to plug this in
[17091.35s -> 17099.83s]  i can't plug a rift generator into that why is it that's just like a jokey outlet over here
[17100.47s -> 17109.54s]  does it go in the outlet well it's plugged in but there's not enough power to turn it on
[17110.26s -> 17117.53s]  okay boiler controls
[17121.05s -> 17133.99s]  well at least the boiler still works uh all right so should i melt them what's with the creepy toy
[17133.99s -> 17142.31s]  box it is everything and nothing the power infinite oh well that makes sense we have guarded
[17142.31s -> 17149.19s]  and worshiped it from behind the shadowy veil of faith for generations we love the box so much
[17149.19s -> 17158.87s]  we've prepared a song about it that song is always the song the toy box cause it's really great
[17159.43s -> 17163.67s]  hey man the musical numbers have really gone downhill since we've been on break
[17164.31s -> 17171.83s]  some of us had grown to believe it was just an allegory i'm looking at you gemadaya but the veil
[17171.83s -> 17180.66s]  has been lifted there it is before us just as the tablets foretold what's inside that toy box
[17180.66s -> 17187.22s]  anyway no one knows no one has seen it for thousands of years there are those who believe
[17187.22s -> 17195.06s]  it contains toys oh right like the creator of all things it's really some fanciful box in the sky
[17195.06s -> 17199.70s]  filled with magical toys you'll have to excuse obadiah he's a fundamentalist
[17202.14s -> 17207.26s]  before it sounded like you were expecting to see max and me yes you're coming with foretold in the
[17207.26s -> 17215.02s]  sacred tablets and scrolls and yay the devil bunny knowing not his true purpose would unlock the
[17215.02s -> 17223.42s]  mysteries of the toy box hey sam it likes me you know what that means obadiah it's time for the
[17223.42s -> 17233.32s]  apocalypse what's that toy box got to do with max he must be blessed with the gift it will bestow

[17907.48s -> 17917.48s]  when i was like when i was like 13 i remember mashing mashing the special button over and over
[17917.48s -> 17923.64s]  again even with default enemies and i i i spent like 20 dollars in one session i think at one
[17923.64s -> 17929.24s]  point i used all of my allowance money i saved up and i didn't even get to like the third boss
[17929.24s -> 17942.81s]  or something that's i'm that's burned in my brain from childhood just then you'd be completely out

[18040.84s -> 18045.48s]  good old steamy has been sporadically keeping our building warm for almost a century it's even
[18045.48s -> 18050.52s]  harder to build there okay it's good how do i get him to move he's gonna slip on this right
[18051.85s -> 18055.69s]  just stop fighting so we can hurry this thing up already i got places to be

[18066.09s -> 18085.24s]  i'd better keep this pretty sloppy on you to miss this toy skunk ape it's the best one yet
[18085.24s -> 18091.88s]  nonsense it's worthless are you kidding me it's just dripping with psychic power right max
[18092.76s -> 18100.41s]  all right that one gives me the power to uh automatically calculate the proper tip at
[18100.41s -> 18107.05s]  restaurants nice one phone head it's a very practical power sam the kid i'll be showstoppers
[18107.05s -> 18120.92s]  give it to me now keep away from the big monkey no fair give it up save the cards
[18120.92s -> 18136.15s]  yes and so our hero saved the world once again our villain undone by his own greed it would seem
[18136.15s -> 18144.31s]  a fitting conclusion but this is not the end oh no but merely a beginning the overture if you will
[18144.31s -> 18153.45s]  of a five-part symphony of mayhem that will blow your ever-loving mind what is this mysterious toy
[18153.93s -> 18161.85s]  with its bizarre connection to max is general skunk ape truly defeated will sam ever find true
[18161.85s -> 18168.81s]  love will max be able to control his emerging powers but are his ominous visions of the future
[18168.81s -> 18176.46s]  a sign of tragedy to come i'll see you in the coming chapters to answer all of these questions
[18176.46s -> 18185.98s]  and more but for now i leave you with this chilling conclusion couch sucked right through
[18185.98s -> 18191.66s]  three floors in a septic tank there goes our security deposit i wonder if our building is
[18191.66s -> 18196.38s]  zoned to act as an interdimensional prison sam what are they looking at
[18197.34s -> 18209.48s]  holy heaping helpings of herodotus on base with marshal stacks and a wah-wah pedal is that us
[18221.03s -> 18226.82s]  imagine that's the only thing i've said this whole entire time
[18249.02s -> 18269.08s]  down there we go that's nice that's tuned down a little pretty cool what a jump in quality
[18270.04s -> 18280.14s]  yeah i mean the world graphics and uh lengthwise definitely i need to do my fast food tier
[18285.59s -> 18301.72s]  oh right um hold on give me a minute do tier lists that was fun that was um

[18320.47s -> 18337.85s]  what like places that i've been season three following a more cohesive story than the last
[18337.85s -> 18348.47s]  two i've never known i've never played it i this is my first time ever playing these games after

[18367.70s -> 18374.84s]  different day because if the episodes are i mean obviously like 40 minutes of that was
[18375.80s -> 18380.12s]  uh from the bullshit we did with chat and all the weird stuff we were doing earlier
[18380.84s -> 18384.44s]  if they're like three to four hours each or four hours four and a half hours something like that
[18385.00s -> 18395.74s]  then i probably do this on a different day because i know we're gonna be in there for like another
[18395.74s -> 18401.42s]  four to five plus hours he's ended this i'm not end of the stream voicing what are you talking
[18401.42s -> 18407.02s]  about what what why is stopping after episode one mean the stream turns off
[18408.87s -> 18416.06s]  what i'm gonna go pee i'm gonna grab a water i'm gonna come back and hang out and do tier lists
[18416.94s -> 18427.40s]  and something else i'm not leaving what are you talking about i'll be right back that didn't even
[18427.40s -> 18443.91s]  cover anything oh yes it did i'll be right back don't go nowhere unless you have to go somewhere
