[28.47s -> 41.61s]  How you doing? Doesn't this guy eat gravel? No. I don't. I don't recommend it either.
[48.25s -> 53.29s]  Dude, can you perform circus tricks on stream? If you do, I'll cash app you 50 cents.
[59.70s -> 67.40s]  You don't have to. You don't have to cash app. I'm not doing it. No, I'm not doing any circus
[67.40s -> 77.26s]  maneuvers. But hello, welcome. Today is Wednesday. Told you at some point midweek.
[78.62s -> 82.87s]  Just going to turn it on. Wednesday or Thursday is Wednesday. Here we are.
[83.51s -> 92.95s]  Gonna be just chilling out playing this game that I've had my eye on for a while. It's called
[94.65s -> 104.31s]  the Eternal Cylinder. It's a game where you have little alien creatures and their planet is being
[104.31s -> 110.07s]  destroyed and you have to save them and help them and it just seemed kind of interesting. So I was
[110.07s -> 125.26s]  like, you know what? Why not? Let's just do it. Gonna be kind of in the same energy level as the
[125.26s -> 135.91s]  plans for a zombie stream. Just going to relax, hang out for a little bit, chill. I love alien
[135.91s -> 154.28s]  creatures. Why do you hate pizza tower? I don't. I don't. Put it on the list. Is this going to be
[154.28s -> 161.16s]  seven hours? No, no, I don't. I mean, probably just a few hours, three, four. I'm just chilling.
[161.16s -> 175.16s]  I'm just here to chill. Bro, where is Frog Detective? Okay, I promise Frog Detective 3
[176.14s -> 183.46s]  will happen in February. If it doesn't happen in February, then you can be very upset with me.
[190.81s -> 197.98s]  If on March 1st you have not seen, if I have not streamed Frog Detective 3,
[198.78s -> 211.75s]  then I'm in big trouble. Anyways, let's go. Don't want to waste too much time. I'm very interested
[211.75s -> 217.35s]  in what this game is. It could be really crazy. It could be chill. Actually, I don't think this
[217.35s -> 225.03s]  is going to be that chill, chill. Cause I mean, we're avoiding the destruction of this species'
[225.03s -> 232.07s]  planet. I think. I don't think this is like, Oh yeah. Just like chilling out. I don't know.
[232.07s -> 241.38s]  It's kind of, it's probably going to be a little wacky. Yeah. The eternal cylinder. Let's just start.
[241.38s -> 247.94s]  Can you hear it? Well, maybe once upon a time in the age of the eternal cylinder, they lived a
[247.94s -> 256.34s]  family of little creatures called the Trebum. Trebum are not the strongest nor the fastest,
[256.34s -> 263.22s]  and they do not have sharp teeth. They would make easy prey for the terrible force that came to their
[263.22s -> 273.90s]  planet. But Trebum are loyal and resourceful and very, very stubborn. Okay. It is with such a Trebum
[273.90s -> 281.56s]  that our story begin. One clever little creature born into a cruel world who would be instrumental
[281.56s -> 295.16s]  in bringing prosperity to its kind. That's me. Is this like Spore? I don't think so. I think.
[295.16s -> 317.42s]  I don't know. We'll find out. Okay. I wonder what happened. Pretty. What an unfortunate place for a
[317.42s -> 328.50s]  beginning. Okay. And now what? Run. Something inside him said run. Run. This is a controller
[328.50s -> 347.45s]  game. What is that? Oh my God. There's a giant wave behind here. I, this is a controller game.
[347.45s -> 376.10s]  Holy shit. Okay. Don't stop running. I'm not. I'm going. I can't make this. Am I going to die?
[381.29s -> 388.17s]  Oh shit. Can I jump? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? The great crushing
[388.17s -> 394.94s]  thing, the great cylinder had stopped. Perhaps it was safe here for a little while. This pub G?
[394.94s -> 401.83s]  How quickly it learned to use its legs and its trunk. But these things were not so much learned
[401.91s -> 410.68s]  as they were remembered. They were a gift from the strange voice it heard in its mind.
[410.68s -> 420.38s]  Are these evil? That too was a kind of memory. Oh, what did I just do? Okay. What? What? Oh,
[420.38s -> 426.47s]  that was weird. What did I just do? Okay. Choose materials you've collected. Okay.
[428.46s -> 435.48s]  And do what? Just eat it? Just when it was starting to get used to its legs,
[436.12s -> 442.66s]  the food from the jumping creature gave it new ones with the right substances. Oh shit. A
[442.66s -> 449.78s]  trebum can transform and adapt to many challenges. Okay. So if I eat, it's kind of like Kirby.
[451.91s -> 455.03s]  Shoot anything from your inventory. Try shooting water at the flying bugs.
[462.38s -> 474.44s]  Shoot. Okay. So I have water in my nose. Okay. We eat that, right? What? Do I like breathe this in
[478.57s -> 495.27s]  that face? It's kind of oops. Okay. I got, should I eat this? Well, oh, no, no, no, no,
[495.27s -> 504.09s]  come back here. Okay. I just shot it out. Hold on. How do I eat that? Okay. I cannot eat this.
[504.73s -> 531.77s]  Should I suck in more than one? I got mushrooms. Eat the mushrooms. What did that do? This might
[531.77s -> 550.94s]  just be healing. What is that? I can only hold three different types of things. All right. That's
[550.94s -> 565.42s]  good to know. This is technically a mushroom. Okay. How much can I hold? Should I store a bunch
[565.42s -> 583.48s]  of this? Like a gerbil? 10? 10 each, you think? We'll do it. Come on. Suck it up. Well, eight's
[583.48s -> 597.74s]  fine. The trebum was drawn to a bright light or perhaps to the creature next to it. A creature.
[600.50s -> 609.66s]  There is something over there. What is that? It's like a brontosaurus. Except for the grass growing
[609.66s -> 618.28s]  on the old one's head. They were very much alike. What? Surrounded by this light,
[619.00s -> 626.36s]  the trebum knew things it had not known before. It knew the older trebum had carried this light
[626.36s -> 632.28s]  for a long, long time. Oh, that's the same species. And it knew that now that responsibility had passed
[632.28s -> 640.07s]  to the next generation. Yes. This young trebum had to carry the light to those great towers in the
[640.07s -> 650.04s]  distance. It could have stayed here to learn many old things, but the cylinder would not allow it.
[650.68s -> 658.71s]  Is it going to start up again? Stanley Parable. Yeah. What makes that happen?
[659.61s -> 666.74s]  Run. The inner voice said run. The towers would not stop the cylinder. I can suck it up. Activated.
[666.74s -> 687.66s]  I'm strong. Roll to move faster. Okay. So I'd go for this thing. I'm going to just say I'm
[687.66s -> 691.34s]  legally drinking alcohol right now. The cylinder would not be stopped.
[691.90s -> 704.98s]  All right. Okay. Is it going to stop? Wait, what? Didn't it say this thing? How do I stop this?
[707.83s -> 715.34s]  Wait, I didn't listen. You got to get out of here. Get out of here. This is like mouth monster.
[715.98s -> 733.83s]  Oh shit. No, don't. No. The voice inside the trebum's memories assured it that while the
[733.83s -> 742.14s]  tower stood, the trebum would be safe. The power of the eternal cylinder was contained for now.
[742.14s -> 746.25s]  Okay. So you block it with this stuff. I want to get a look at this. Is this thing?
[746.97s -> 753.93s]  What are you doing? Relative tranquility gave the trebum a chance to think about its family.
[755.13s -> 761.61s]  I'm not meant to be alone. So where were the others? I wanted to make a friend,
[762.09s -> 766.65s]  I wanted to make a friend. I didn't know. We've both just survived that together. You'd think
[766.65s -> 771.61s]  that we would have sort of like a Wizard of Oz moment where it's like, hey, we both have the same
[771.61s -> 787.08s]  shit going on. I guess not. Okay. Well, checkpoint. Good. Thank God. The giant mouth is not a friend.
[787.08s -> 796.04s]  I didn't know everything was dangerous. Okay. The voice inside the trebum's memories assured it
[796.04s -> 802.90s]  that while the tower stood, the trebum would be safe. The power of the eternal cylinder was
[802.90s -> 814.97s]  contained for now. This thing is crazy looking. You want to share food gave the trebum a chance
[814.97s -> 822.17s]  to think about its family. Trebum are not meant to live alone. So where were the others? We're
[822.17s -> 834.15s]  going to find more. Okay. Ready to eat this stuff. I feel like there's a lot of random things I can
[834.15s -> 840.82s]  collect. All right. These are like eggs over there. This counts as water. Oh, I have like a water
[840.82s -> 854.98s]  meter. Okay. So I got to find more friends. This character looks like you. Yeah, maybe a little.
[859.51s -> 867.03s]  Our young friend had found an egg, a trebum egg with one of his siblings inside.
[867.03s -> 871.51s]  Okay. The egg had been abandoned, but it could still be made to hatch.
[872.07s -> 883.37s]  All that was needed was a source of heat. I'm going to break this if I move it. This looks like
[883.37s -> 891.46s]  kind of an incubator. Oh, put it down. I know. Okay. This is like the, oh,
[893.86s -> 903.82s]  Wugwool. Okay. Hey, hey, hey, don't just eat stuff. Don't just eat stuff. I don't wait. I can't
[903.82s -> 913.67s]  control Wugwool. Wugwool just has, has a mind. I like the pattern. Okay. So we got two now.
[913.67s -> 922.57s]  How do I make it so you have bigger legs here? Eat this like fucking turnip, whatever this is.
[924.90s -> 938.71s]  Oh, that's me eating it. Here. Try one of these. Eat that. You don't want that? All right. I'll keep
[938.71s -> 950.02s]  it. All right. So we have another party member. This is not moving yet. So that's good. Anything
[950.02s -> 958.42s]  else to do here? What about this stuff? Ooh, I think it's just food. I don't think it doesn't do
[958.42s -> 968.44s]  anything. I ate that grasshopper and I got legs. I can't really eat anything else. All right. There's
[968.44s -> 981.53s]  a mouth monster over there. I'm not going over there. I wonder how many, uh, like little people
[981.53s -> 991.61s]  you end up having. Do I have a life cycle? Am I just gonna die eventually? Oh, it's way too cold
[991.61s -> 1001.51s]  over here. Get out. Can we eat something to make us have, I don't know. Let's see. Come on. Mutation
[1001.51s -> 1008.95s]  items have a lightning bolt next to them. Oh, so imagine that's just health. It's probably just
[1008.95s -> 1020.68s]  food. Health. Did I miss something? Anything else to do? I'm very intrigued by this game.
[1021.24s -> 1040.18s]  Drink some water. Actually, yeah. It's too cold over there though. What's that? These animals?
[1043.13s -> 1069.75s]  This is fucking Dr. Sue shit. Ooh, hold on. Ooh, what does this do? How do I do that?
[1077.67s -> 1087.22s]  That's annoying. Should we both eat one? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Let's test it.
[1098.04s -> 1108.54s]  Yeah, that's what I thought. Spore two with fart noises. I think I just have to explore.
[1108.54s -> 1118.65s]  It's so cold over here though. Shit. No, this way. You're doing the auto voice. Yeah, of course. I'm
[1118.65s -> 1135.02s]  doing auto. Wait, how long can I, hold on. Are these predators? Wait, this is fuzzy. Hold on. Wait,
[1135.50s -> 1163.16s]  can we wear these? It's going to be like a sweater. Did you get one too? Now we're fuzzy. I feel like
[1163.16s -> 1169.96s]  this game is dangerous. I'm going to get, okay. Do you see anything else? Hold on. I'm going to
[1169.96s -> 1182.60s]  go this way. Oh shit. Don't die. Is there fall damage? Weird mushrooms. I need water. You just
[1182.60s -> 1192.55s]  die if you run out of water. You can swap. Oh, I can swap. Okay. Q swaps. Interesting. All right.
[1192.55s -> 1219.16s]  There's an egg over there. Can we sneak by this thing? Oh God. Is it awake? Get me out of here.
[1219.16s -> 1244.06s]  A new family member. Gui. Okay. Hi, Gui. Okay, so we're, Gui doesn't have any protection from
[1244.06s -> 1255.22s]  heat though. I mean cold. What the fuck did you just do? I think Gui needs fur, right? We need,
[1255.22s -> 1267.21s]  hold on. No, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We sharing it? I think we, yeah, we shared it.
[1267.21s -> 1285.35s]  Why can I not move? Okay. I can't move with this creature. Why not? I can't physically move. That's
[1285.35s -> 1303.21s]  strange. Okay. Well, whatever. I got three. I need water. I have to find a pond or something.
[1303.21s -> 1310.78s]  Wait, there's water here. This is frozen water. Can we like break it? Can we drink out of this?
[1310.78s -> 1327.22s]  Come on. There's gotta be something I can drink. Get the water eggs. Oh, that's a good idea.
[1327.22s -> 1346.47s]  Why can I not control this guy? Oh, this is water. Okay. We're going to die. There's like a big lake
[1346.47s -> 1363.66s]  over here. Can I just stick my face in here? Just drink it? All right. Yes, we can do this.
[1363.66s -> 1376.90s]  Come drink. Make sure you get, yeah, there we go. I have lost control of this character. I can,
[1376.90s -> 1390.49s]  all I can do is drink. Satisfied? This thing hasn't started moving. Should I swim over
[1390.49s -> 1403.03s]  there or anything? It's all salt water. Where to go? It's too young to swim across. Watch for the
[1403.03s -> 1408.54s]  beams of light that come from activated towers. They will point you to objectives or areas of
[1408.54s -> 1417.59s]  interest. Ooh. It was hard for the Trevim to know what to do or where to go, but the friendly voice
[1417.59s -> 1425.11s]  suggested this was not the right way. Stream remote? To find your path, it said you must follow
[1425.11s -> 1432.28s]  the beam of light. I did not get Luigi'd. To the tip of the tower and stay away from the deep waters
[1432.28s -> 1439.85s]  where the old things dwell. I didn't get, I did not get Luigi'd. Wait, everybody should have the
[1439.85s -> 1453.43s]  little horn, right? Where's the horn? I just heard it. Or maybe not. Okay, so we need to go this way.
[1453.43s -> 1473.59s]  Did everybody have a horn? Why not? Yeah, might as well take one. I think this is my favorite,
[1473.59s -> 1496.46s]  like the blue. So everybody has access to that. All right, let's control. All right, this thing
[1496.46s -> 1506.26s]  wants me to go this way. We could probably fuck somebody up. Not that that's what I want to do.
[1506.26s -> 1517.37s]  I'm just making it clear that, what's that? Wait, the snail, that was just open. What was that? Did
[1517.37s -> 1536.86s]  you see that? What does that sound? That was a free, yeah, that's a freaky snail. What do we do
[1536.86s -> 1551.56s]  this guy? I don't know, I got him. I don't know. What should we do with him? Kill it? Why? What
[1551.56s -> 1577.16s]  if it could help us? Wait, that guy just attacked me. Get out of here. Just jump over. Wait.
[1579.82s -> 1597.06s]  He's like a little weirdo. Get out of here. What the fuck? I'm gonna play this instrument
[1597.06s -> 1610.60s]  ever again, I promise. Holy shit, that was crazy. Okay. Whatever that is, it's big and I don't know
[1610.60s -> 1632.41s]  if it's friendly. Something's loud. Will you go down water? Wait, there's an egg. A fish. I just
[1632.41s -> 1670.01s]  got a fish. Hold on. Get rid of this. All right. Get the egg. How do we get up there? We just suck
[1670.01s -> 1677.05s]  it up from here? I don't know. Oh my god. Get out of the water. Get out of the water. We think we're
[1677.05s -> 1685.70s]  dying. We're struggling. Get out of the water. We're struggling so bad. Please don't drown. Okay.
[1685.70s -> 1696.68s]  Oh my god. That was bad. Can I knock the, wait, come here. I have an idea. Fuck. That was a
[1696.68s -> 1711.11s]  gridded. That was a bad idea. Stack them up. Can we do that? Can I jump on top of one of their heads?
[1717.96s -> 1726.14s]  Maybe it's the fish that has, wait, the fish. This is part of the fish here. This is just food.
[1726.14s -> 1738.70s]  Yeah, it's just food. Wait a minute. This is something else. Back to the surface. Quick.
[1739.34s -> 1758.46s]  What does this do? All right. Not all, don't all of you eat that. Don't all of you eat that. This guy
[1758.46s -> 1777.22s]  just turned into a cement brick. I don't know if that was a good idea. Well, I don't know. What
[1777.22s -> 1790.49s]  about the fish? All right. This is an actual fish. What do you do? Frog? Swimming more quickly but
[1790.49s -> 1797.02s]  can form a high jump out of the water. All right. Cool. So we've got float guy, frog guy, and
[1798.57s -> 1805.42s]  whatever I can do with you, I kind of, I can't move for some reason. I think it's bugged,
[1805.42s -> 1813.02s]  but I can't walk along with this character. I think it's a bug. I wonder, can I tell people
[1813.02s -> 1826.30s]  to stop just to stay or is there like a command? Maybe restart it. Save and reload. Yeah, we'll
[1826.30s -> 1842.39s]  save it. Save and then main menu. Look at the tutorial. I, I mean, I, I just, I can't move with
[1842.39s -> 1854.62s]  that, that one for some reason. I don't know why. Is he too heavy? That's possible, but I don't know.
[1854.62s -> 1861.62s]  I think one of the incubators is over here. He's going to be in this one. This game's cute. I like
[1861.62s -> 1884.86s]  it. You just kind of get like friends. We all have a job. Okay. Okay. Or when somebody dies,
[1884.86s -> 1903.54s]  I'm going to be really sad. Ah, that's way more helpful. If I hold Q, I can just select the one
[1903.54s -> 1912.01s]  I want to control. This one's still bugged, but it's all right. All right. Well, what do I want
[1912.01s -> 1933.06s]  this one to eat? Reload it, save, and then just load the save. Use the broken one as cannon fodder.
[1942.28s -> 1948.23s]  We have to go over there and I'm, I can tell you, I'm not super thrilled about it. There we go. Okay.
[1948.23s -> 1971.10s]  I can control this one now. Stop sucking up random stuff. I feel like these guys,
[1971.10s -> 1977.16s]  I feel like this is going to eat one of us. Right? Who, I don't want, I'm not getting rid of the,
[1977.16s -> 1985.88s]  the big one. Oh God. All right. Should I just get up? This door had been built for Trebum.
[1987.06s -> 1996.54s]  It gave them hope that in this large and dangerous world, some places had been made for them.
[1999.40s -> 2006.97s]  Whoa. What's that thing? What did I just get? Some ingredients cannot be eaten until their
[2006.97s -> 2011.93s]  edible interiors have been exposed. There are multiple ways to break open ingredients. Try
[2011.93s -> 2016.44s]  experimenting with throwing them, crushing them, or feeding them to other creatures.
[2016.44s -> 2024.26s]  Items with a breakable exterior are marked with a yellow border. Oh my, I feel so bad.
[2025.37s -> 2031.34s]  We just like took that snails. I don't know what we did, but I don't, I'm kind of sad about it.
[2034.39s -> 2046.28s]  All right. Everybody in. I broke it. I don't, I don't know what that is. Who should eat this?
[2049.80s -> 2059.13s]  I mean, you've got like the big butt power. You've got the swimming power. I have jumping power.
[2059.13s -> 2071.83s]  The new guy here. Try this. This is going to snail power. What does, what would that even mean?
[2078.10s -> 2082.46s]  Whoa. Make some shiny, sparkly, and very attractive.
[2085.42s -> 2101.96s]  This is like the attractive one. Okay. Well, cool. Let's go. I wonder if this is like a little
[2101.96s -> 2117.64s]  hideout. Hmm. Have to quickly change the group leader. Hold to manually select. Don't worry.
[2117.64s -> 2122.17s]  If you lose sight of one of your family members, you do not need to wait for other TREBUM. They
[2122.17s -> 2125.69s]  will always manage to get where the group leader is. Okay. So you don't have to worry about them.
[2125.69s -> 2139.66s]  So they will always get to where you're going or better for us, I guess. It's like, Ooh,
[2139.66s -> 2157.24s]  what is that? To the top, right? I'm kind of resource. We should eat like a kind of like
[2157.24s -> 2166.95s]  alien watermelon. All right. Everybody eat these. I'm going to clear up the inventory.
[2170.86s -> 2182.86s]  Sell that one. It's rare. This is a family. Nobody low on water. I think everyone's fine.
[2182.86s -> 2196.70s]  What do you have so many mushrooms? Just eat them. Oh my God. I just ate everything.
[2196.70s -> 2208.79s]  Okay. Don't all of you do that. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. You ate all the food.
[2208.79s -> 2218.71s]  Was that our, wait, I probably shouldn't have not. I probably shouldn't have done that.
[2218.71s -> 2231.66s]  Interact. Somehow this ancient statue transferred knowledge to the TREBUM.
[2231.66s -> 2247.69s]  This tells you what everything does. Inventory. Oh, he's got a way bigger inventory. Okay. That's
[2247.69s -> 2264.90s]  cool. All right. You hold all the snacks. You're going to be the snack storage. The map is here.
[2264.90s -> 2275.51s]  Very nice. It was as if a memory had been stored inside it, waiting for someone to absorb it.
[2275.51s -> 2281.85s]  And as soon as this knowledge had entered their minds, the TREBUM realized that there was a great
[2281.85s -> 2288.15s]  library of information hidden away in the web of their memories. But why was the knowledge of a
[2288.15s -> 2298.49s]  specific ingredient placed here in this TREBUM made of stone? I wonder. Oh, more of this.
[2298.49s -> 2319.06s]  Do you collect this dust? They're learning. Okay. Well, can we get it? Are we supposed to?
[2319.06s -> 2349.42s]  We did it. All right. Who wants to eat this weird cube? It's so stylish. The stylish cube.
[2349.42s -> 2363.51s]  So yeah, I can fit in here. Ah, it opens the door.
[2363.51s -> 2383.35s]  Garumo the Elder. I'm going to start talking. Wait, this is a, oh, this is an adult? Inside the cave,
[2383.35s -> 2390.76s]  the TREBUM found a living elder. It had been waiting in this chamber for a long, long time.
[2390.76s -> 2396.68s]  The elder told them it was happy to see some friends before the cylinder came. This is kind
[2396.68s -> 2404.06s]  of sad. It said, you are young. So you never knew the time when our people could shape shift at will.
[2404.06s -> 2412.41s]  We TREBUM are inheritors of a vast tree of abilities, abilities passed on to all future TREBUM.
[2412.41s -> 2419.99s]  But this power is being taken away. Beware the servants of the cylinder. They will seek to hurt
[2419.99s -> 2426.89s]  you at every opportunity. And they have the power to rob you of your abilities. Like a car? But if
[2426.89s -> 2434.62s]  you persevere, one day you will find a way to protect yourselves from their evil light. Farewell,
[2434.62s -> 2442.70s]  my brave friends. I fear I am too old and tired to join you. May you find a way to prosper
[2442.70s -> 2458.58s]  in this time of struggles. All right, so thanks for helping. Here, have a mushroom on me.
[2458.58s -> 2474.65s]  Okay, so we can go that way. Wait, wait, wait, wait. He almost shot it up his nose.
[2475.69s -> 2482.10s]  What is this? This is like a bath? It's like a little bird bath. Everybody,
[2482.10s -> 2494.25s]  should we get into the, this is like a jacuzzi? Easy. Oh, it's a place to fill up water.
[2494.25s -> 2507.22s]  You should make the fat one eat a cube. Maybe. Is everybody good? Everybody have water? Make sure
[2507.22s -> 2516.49s]  to fill up. We're not, we're gonna get out of here. Should the fat one eat a cube? I don't know if I
[2516.49s -> 2541.05s]  want another big cube. Should I? Yes. Okay. All right, so he's not, it squished him down.
[2541.05s -> 2552.26s]  He's not big anymore. It's a cube. So the power is, some of them don't stack. So now I just have two
[2552.26s -> 2561.05s]  cubes. I lost my, I had a bunch of watermelons. Turn him back. I can't turn him back. He's,
[2561.13s -> 2570.49s]  he's like this permanently. Everybody else want to be a cube? No, we are, we have two cubes. That's
[2570.49s -> 2585.22s]  good enough. Make him eat something. You can't have a double cube, right? Yeah, just need to
[2585.22s -> 2600.71s]  find another one of those fishes. That's fine. All right. Let's keep going. Load the save. No,
[2600.71s -> 2609.64s]  we have to experiment. Give them nicknames. I don't want to, because I know for a fact that
[2609.64s -> 2614.12s]  some of them are going to die. Like, I just know it. You know it. I know it. It was not easy to
[2614.12s -> 2621.78s]  leave the cave, but the elder had urged them to go forward. Suddenly they felt the weight of their
[2621.78s -> 2629.53s]  many tasks to find their trebum siblings, to restore the powers their people had lost.
[2629.53s -> 2640.50s]  They all seemed a little daunting, but even when they are afraid, trebum are stubborn.
[2640.50s -> 2655.78s]  You okay? How do we rescue this one? Food? Here, eat this. Can you eat that? What about water?
[2658.63s -> 2682.25s]  It didn't work. What? I'm trying. Grunk? What is this? What? I need four. Oh, okay.
[2682.25s -> 2686.81s]  We have to feed him for the of the. All right. All right. All right. We have to save this guy.
[2686.81s -> 2702.23s]  All that little stardust. Fuck. I just wasted so much water. Okay. Do I still have the indicator
[2702.23s -> 2732.36s]  telling me where to go? Let's get water first. Anything happen at night? Oh, fuck. Don't come
[2732.36s -> 2749.94s]  in here. I need the jumper. It did say, don't worry. They will find a way to you. I'm looking
[2749.94s -> 2762.63s]  for more of that stardust. The cave had more dust. Oh, is that right there? No. Checking to see.
[2762.63s -> 2774.01s]  What's this? Weird mushrooms. I don't want them. Whoa. What the fuck is this? These are different.
[2774.01s -> 2791.24s]  These are like different eggs. This is bad. Should I hatch this? We're gonna take more than one.
[2791.24s -> 2802.36s]  Here. Okay. Somebody grab that one. Grab that one. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[2802.36s -> 2821.32s]  All right. Where's an incubator? Break one? No, I don't want to do that. Incubator. Get the
[2821.32s -> 2841.34s]  stardust, bro. Hold on. Is there no incubator around here? There's one over there. Bro. What
[2841.34s -> 2852.28s]  is this stuff for? Exiting the blue energy dome that radiates from the tower you activated will
[2852.28s -> 2857.88s]  awaken the eternal cylinder. Warning. Not all towers have the same radius of protection. Some
[2857.88s -> 2867.70s]  may be weaker. Oh, when I walk. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Get out of there. No, no, no, no.
[2867.70s -> 2872.71s]  Run, run, run. Is this their egg? Is this yours? You can have back. Take it back. You can have back.
[2872.71s -> 2883.11s]  You can have back. Yeah. Take it back. Take it back. Run. I think that was, was that their egg?
[2883.83s -> 2887.16s]  I don't know. Just run. Just get away. Get away. Get away. I don't know where to go. I don't know
[2887.16s -> 2893.02s]  where to go. I'm freaking out. All right. Where's the egg? Where'd it go? Give it to me. I'm taking
[2893.02s -> 2905.59s]  it. I don't care. Well, what? Oh, shit. The cylinder resumed its destruction. Nothing could
[2905.59s -> 2916.02s]  stop it forever. Yeah. They need to roll to safety to find another tower. Crap. All right. Come on.
[2916.02s -> 2923.61s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. What? I don't know what this is, but I want it. It's like a weird
[2923.69s -> 2938.92s]  magical... Okay, go. This one right here. Oh, no, our... The friend. I forgot. I forgot about that.
[2938.92s -> 2951.30s]  Oh, no. That's not good. That's too bad. That's too bad. Grungo, whatever his name was.
[2954.58s -> 2969.85s]  You murdered him. Keep going. Come on. Oh my God. Go, go, go, go, go. Reload. No, it's okay.
[2969.85s -> 2983.91s]  I made the mistake. I'm going to live with it. Oh, that's sad. It's okay. Please reload. I can't.
[2984.63s -> 2999.40s]  I made the mistake. I have to live with it. The Trebem found themselves almost as lost as they
[2999.40s -> 3005.00s]  had been in the beginning. And where is the fifth? The most powerful of all the Trebems.
[3005.00s -> 3013.03s]  It was only natural to be confused, it said. They had been born into a strange, broken world,
[3013.03s -> 3019.62s]  cut off from the history of their ancestors. Everyone was a little lost these days. What
[3019.62s -> 3027.22s]  mattered was to keep going, to keep looking for answers, to keep carrying the light they held
[3027.22s -> 3036.84s]  within them. The light that stopped the cylinder. Why is this one almost dead? Okay. That would have
[3036.84s -> 3066.79s]  been sad. Water. I can't find any. You're kind of not understanding the fart dynamic. Sorry about
[3066.79s -> 3082.60s]  that. Let's continue. That looks like poisonous. I don't think I want to go in there. Is this over
[3082.60s -> 3111.16s]  here? I'm going to go in this. Okay. What's this? We're all making it out alive. The strange,
[3111.16s -> 3119.78s]  eerie temple. The Trebem felt something stir in their memories. There was a great power in this
[3119.78s -> 3128.01s]  place. Something from the days when even the elders were young. Perhaps it could help them.
[3128.01s -> 3141.35s]  A stir is here. What's up, dude? All right, this is a power. Who should have this? I think I'm
[3141.35s -> 3151.40s]  giving it to you. Eat that. I don't know what this is going to do. Hopefully it doesn't do anything
[3151.40s -> 3172.10s]  weird. Okay, so he attracts the flies. He's just cool hair now. This attracts these flies. Wait,
[3172.10s -> 3182.87s]  what am I looking at here? What is this? This is a human. This is a human. No, wait, what the
[3182.87s -> 3195.03s]  fuck is that? What is this? It's like a human in a human. All right. Well, what do I do here?
[3195.03s -> 3212.84s]  Get those. I think I have to bring them over here. Yeah. Wait, what's this? I don't know. What does
[3212.84s -> 3222.78s]  this do? I don't know. They're like little crystals. I'm taking them. The humans have mutations too.
[3230.70s -> 3245.22s]  That was very ominous. Uh, okay. So I think I just have to bring flies over here to follow me.
[3245.30s -> 3262.02s]  All right, here they come. Okay. Now can somebody take that? All right, who has a room?
[3262.02s -> 3277.66s]  You. No, maybe not. Oh, wait. Could not retrieve any helpful information from the Trebum memory
[3277.66s -> 3290.02s]  cluster. Whoa. So was that giving me? The Trebum were disoriented for a moment. It was like a
[3290.02s -> 3294.02s]  finished map. Something new had entered their memories and they needed to make sense of it.
[3295.06s -> 3304.92s]  It seemed to be a map. And on this map, a location had been marked. If they understood correctly,
[3304.92s -> 3311.96s]  there was some manner of serpent, a guardian, a greater being of some kind, somehow linked
[3311.96s -> 3320.46s]  to a safe haven. Could they find refuge there? Their ancestors must have created this map
[3320.46s -> 3327.05s]  for a reason. All right. So we have to go find the big giant serpent thing. So hold on. Let me,
[3327.05s -> 3333.34s]  how do I get to this menu? Can I press a certain button to get there? How do I get to that menu?
[3340.23s -> 3363.24s]  M escape. Press the map key. Hold on. Let me roll. Spit open inventory. Interact. I think it's I.
[3365.16s -> 3370.46s]  Yes. Okay. So a map it's marked on. It's now marked, which is up here. So we've got to go
[3370.46s -> 3384.46s]  out here through here to here. Good luck. So this gives you a map fragment piece. Wait,
[3384.46s -> 3402.07s]  hold on. What's that? You see that up here? I wonder if I can eat that. Can I grab that?
[3406.57s -> 3413.38s]  Oh, thank God. Tapioca pudding. Yay or nay? Uh, tapioca pudding is probably,
[3414.58s -> 3422.58s]  it's probably a nay for me. I don't hate it, but I'm not, I wouldn't order it. I know that a lot of
[3422.58s -> 3436.65s]  some of what Boba right is tapioca. That's, that's all right. Ooh, where did that just go? Oh,
[3436.65s -> 3459.69s]  okay. A little ball. I'm gonna pick this up. I gotta break it. Shit. What is, okay. We have
[3459.69s -> 3467.91s]  two cubes. One of the cubes is not going to be a cube anymore. Should we give it to the attractive
[3467.91s -> 3483.66s]  one or the, I don't know, give it a blue. All right. The attractive cube or the blue. Okay.
[3483.66s -> 3500.44s]  Well, we'll give it a blue. So much bullshit. Get rid of these stupid mushrooms. Get this out of
[3500.44s -> 3522.15s]  here. Stop eating and get rid of that. Let's see what happens. Plated body. Okay. I got a shell,
[3522.15s -> 3529.37s]  but this, this one's a fight. This one can fight now. Turtle. All right. Let's fill up.
[3529.37s -> 3540.06s]  Now we got to get out of here. I kind of want to see if I can get that.
[3540.06s -> 3548.10s]  You know what I mean? Can I break this shit? I feel like I can use this for some reason.
[3548.10s -> 3565.24s]  These little crystal things. I feel like I can get that. Should we water at it? Oh, it worked.
[3565.24s -> 3574.73s]  It actually worked. All right. What is this thing? I don't know who's going to eat this.
[3574.73s -> 3577.77s]  Dude, what is this? I don't know what this is going to do. Should I hold it?
[3577.77s -> 3591.67s]  I'm going to hold onto this. Yeah. I'm going to hold this. We have turtle.
[3591.67s -> 3597.99s]  We have fish. We have jumping spiky haired dude. And we have attractive cube. I think this is good
[3597.99s -> 3618.14s]  for now. I think this is okay. Let's keep going. Would you please, uh, project song void? I think
[3618.14s -> 3631.66s]  so. What manner of strange beast lurk behind the center? The trebum were deeply unsettled by this
[3631.66s -> 3639.69s]  new mystery, but though some part of them was curious, they were certain it would be best not
[3639.69s -> 3649.00s]  to find out. Where is everybody? Uh, yeah. Get me out of there. The narrative just cough.
[3650.04s -> 3671.08s]  They should not find out. There's an incubator here. Um, I wish I had one of them. What is this?
[3671.08s -> 3681.48s]  This is just food. I don't want to go yet. Holy shit. What's that? Oh my God. All right.
[3681.48s -> 3694.60s]  There's too many things. Um, just eat it. Water processor? The water processor mutation is
[3694.60s -> 3700.92s]  constantly processing ingredients found in its inventory slots, transforming them into water.
[3700.92s -> 3705.64s]  Note that this does not extract any nutrients from them. Be mindful of what you absorb with
[3705.64s -> 3711.34s]  this trebum as its body will automatically process any organic ingredients stored inside.
[3711.34s -> 3718.49s]  The trebum were excited by this discovery. This new mutation would allow them to extract water
[3718.49s -> 3724.57s]  from ingredients that were otherwise quite dry. Don't do that. But the voice cautioned them to
[3724.57s -> 3732.82s]  be careful. More water was useful, but this process would not extract any nutrients. They
[3732.82s -> 3740.87s]  would have to use it carefully and wisely. Uh, somebody just turned into a water filter. All
[3740.87s -> 3761.35s]  right. So let's go with this. I mean, maybe the thing that's 10, right? Maybe this too. Okay.
[3761.35s -> 3769.90s]  This is just going to be producing water. You put dry things in it and it just makes,
[3769.90s -> 3775.91s]  okay. So this thing, it just needs to suck up a bunch of junk, right? All right. Let's keep going.
[3775.91s -> 3799.02s]  Oh God. Okay. We need another egg. You gave him too many items. Oh shit. All right. I said,
[3799.02s -> 3822.70s]  you mean only give stuff to this character when we need water. Does that mean, all right,
[3822.70s -> 3837.94s]  when you're looking for an egg, looking for eggs, that's interesting. Whatever that is,
[3837.94s -> 3848.66s]  I want to go look at it. Does it show where we are on the map? It does. All right. We need to
[3848.66s -> 3865.98s]  go up here. So I, let me, let me investigate this. All right. Go, go, go, go. Do not aggro that thing.
[3865.98s -> 3875.88s]  I want this weird building over here. Is this, is this building, whatever this weird like big
[3875.88s -> 3881.06s]  piece of artwork it looks like. All right. What's this? Oh fuck. Everybody's cold.
[3883.03s -> 3891.62s]  We still don't, we don't have that mutation. I thought we had it. All right. I won't be here
[3891.62s -> 3910.36s]  long. What is in here? Nothing in here. It's like a cool thing. There's gotta be something over here.
[3917.45s -> 3920.41s]  Well, no, no, no, don't just pick stuff up. You're going to turn it into water. Actually,
[3920.41s -> 3933.37s]  that's okay. All right. We're going to get out of here. What's this? I don't know what this does.
[3933.37s -> 3937.38s]  I don't know. This is somebody take this. We're going to get, we gotta get out of the cold now.
[3937.38s -> 3942.17s]  Get out of the cold, out of the cold. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. How do I get out of the cold?
[3942.17s -> 3944.89s]  We've got to go this way. Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[3944.89s -> 3960.06s]  Come on, get out, out, out, out, out. We're okay. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out,
[3960.06s -> 3965.70s]  get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out,
[3965.70s -> 3976.86s]  get out, get out, get out. Don't die, please. Oh, wait, the thing's moving. The thing's moving.
[3976.86s -> 3996.60s]  It's moving. It's moving. Go, go, go, go, go. Eat this? What happened? Oh shit. Whoa, no.
[3997.98s -> 4002.60s]  No, no, no, no. Back it up, back it up. Back, back, back. Back, back, back, back, back,
[4002.60s -> 4008.76s]  back, back. This way, this way, this way. Oh no, that's awful. Oh no. We're all gonna die.
[4008.76s -> 4011.40s]  We're all gonna die. Follow me, follow me, please.
[4013.26s -> 4019.74s]  Go, oh I fucked up everything. I fucked everything up. I ruined everything. It's okay,
[4019.74s -> 4027.08s]  it's okay. It's alright. We gotta get over here. We gotta get this way, through here. We're safe.
[4027.76s -> 4034.02s]  Okay
[4034.02s -> 4037.82s]  Come on. Oh
[4037.82s -> 4045.23s]  Goodness, okay, so that was a little bit of a problem. That was a little bit of a problem. I have to activate it. Oh
[4047.22s -> 4049.22s]  shit
[4051.18s -> 4052.78s]  Was lost
[4052.78s -> 4056.38s]  There was no more pointed running. Yes, there is yes, there is under
[4057.42s -> 4063.00s]  Consume and I thought it was gonna stop it. I thought it was gonna block it. I thought it was gonna block it
[4063.00s -> 4065.30s]  I thought I was gonna block it. Is there no more of those things?
[4074.46s -> 4076.38s]  My god
[4076.38s -> 4083.65s]  Okay, I didn't know I had to activate it. That was terrible. I feel so bad
[4086.10s -> 4096.25s]  Okay. Well, did the auto save this is two minutes ago. Okay, we're good
[4096.73s -> 4107.66s]  We need to just go this way. I had it right just get out of here. I do want to eat though
[4107.66s -> 4112.20s]  I want to eat this
[4112.44s -> 4115.38s]  Because this thing makes water what the fuck did you just do?
[4115.92s -> 4120.74s]  Okay, we're good. So now this thing processes more water
[4121.92s -> 4123.20s]  So it's better
[4123.20s -> 4135.98s]  Here we go. Okay, everyone sit out here for a sec. I'm not gonna activate it yet. Please get away from us
[4136.26s -> 4154.66s]  Is there an egg here egg egg? Wait people say an egg. Is there an egg? Was there an egg? I don't see one. Oh
[4167.22s -> 4169.22s]  My god, everything is so dangerous
[4169.94s -> 4173.26s]  It's a big peach egg
[4173.46s -> 4175.14s]  No
[4175.14s -> 4177.14s]  Guys, that's a mouth monster
[4177.14s -> 4182.30s]  Hey
[4182.30s -> 4205.13s]  We're good. What about this thing? Do you do anything? Can we do anything with this or is it just a set piece?
[4205.49s -> 4237.50s]  You left an egg. I don't think I did. I got plenty of time. I don't see anything
[4238.34s -> 4252.86s]  Usually they'd be like a little oh no. Look at the distance gonna make it you're gonna make it. Oh
[4255.78s -> 4279.82s]  They're not gonna make it. All right, it's wrong. Oh wait, you're hungry. Does anybody have food?
[4281.14s -> 4285.26s]  Okay, the stomach meter represents your party's food and energy level
[4285.26s -> 4288.81s]  It's divided into two parts stomach and the energy pouch
[4289.05s -> 4295.94s]  I'm a calls all the food you consume and fills up depending on the nutritional qualities the ingredients you eat and digest food when
[4295.98s -> 4303.55s]  Resting or standing still which depletes the stomach and fills the energy pouch and you pouch is not only necessary
[4304.07s -> 4308.27s]  For your tribune to survive it's essential for replenishing the energy the tribune used to roll
[4308.47s -> 4316.28s]  Those energy you have the more slowly your stamina and endurance will regenerate. Okay rolling consumes a lot of energy
[4316.28s -> 4321.44s]  So if you plan on rolling to distant safe areas, you must be prepared as their fear faded
[4321.64s -> 4328.41s]  The trebum started feeling weak and tired with all the excitement and adventure
[4328.41s -> 4336.90s]  They've neglected their most basic needs the sound of an empty stomach reminded them that survival requires more than
[4337.50s -> 4341.59s]  Escaping from danger. Okay, you also have to eat
[4342.59s -> 4348.21s]  Luckily when the cylinder is the internal the trebum is the capacity to store food in their bodies
[4348.67s -> 4356.02s]  But they still need to digest it to gain the vital energy that gives them strength and for such small creatures
[4356.30s -> 4358.98s]  They do require rather a lot of food
[4358.98s -> 4366.51s]  I fortunately the Savannah was rich in flora and fauna which would satisfy their little bellies
[4367.23s -> 4368.95s]  without necessarily
[4368.95s -> 4370.15s]  triggering a
[4370.15s -> 4375.43s]  Mutation so I think you share it. It looks like it's when I eat it goes plus plus plus
[4375.43s -> 4389.28s]  I think it's for everybody. Alright, so they're introducing mechanics as we go. That's interesting. Whatever that is. Alright, I'm fairly safe right now
[4389.52s -> 4406.94s]  I'm looking for eggs. This is games really cool. I like it
[4406.94s -> 4427.78s]  So I'm imagining you probably can get anti poison protection or something. You should use that thing
[4427.78s -> 4436.79s]  You already have um, who has the turtle has it? I think I'm gonna feed this to
[4437.15s -> 4460.36s]  The attractive cube third I can use this mutation to look for specific ingredients by tagging them in the compendium
[4460.64s -> 4468.27s]  Okay of all the changes that trebum were experiencing growing a third
[4468.27s -> 4473.88s]  I was the strangest one yet and make things even stranger
[4473.96s -> 4477.18s]  This I seem to look in two directions at once
[4478.10s -> 4482.33s]  Into the world and into their memories like the eye icon
[4482.97s -> 4489.60s]  To find in the real world any element that was contained in the web of their memories
[4490.44s -> 4495.02s]  It was truly a remarkable mutation. What should I look for?
[4496.52s -> 4506.80s]  Where's the thing to make the big puffy one? One of these here look for this
[4506.92s -> 4523.82s]  Okay, if I do that, then how do I know where it is? I wonder looks kind of funny
[4523.86s -> 4534.73s]  Can you do eggs? Can you look for eggs? That's a good point egg yolk
[4537.78s -> 4554.24s]  Egg shroom, I don't think I can look for them individually all hail attractive cube seer of the unseen
[4555.08s -> 4564.60s]  There's a creature tab
[4569.50s -> 4592.33s]  Alright we need to find an egg. I need to find a fifth party member. Mm-hmm. Alright new friend. They need incubator
[4592.33s -> 4614.15s]  I don't see wait that one over here sacrifice the rest of them. You only need one. I
[4615.70s -> 4630.34s]  Highly doubt that here we go. What we're good. Once I get more than five or six of these
[4630.34s -> 4645.72s]  I feel like I'm gonna start losing track. Alright, what do we get? Come on out friend grew Temu. Hello grew Temu
[4645.76s -> 4659.75s]  What are we gonna turn you into? We'll figure that out. Alright, we need to eat who has food you do eat a few mushrooms
[4659.75s -> 4674.79s]  What about his mouth? But
[4676.19s -> 4688.67s]  Okay, we got a new friend. The goal is ultimately to go this way. Yeah, we're gonna go up here. There is another
[4689.49s -> 4692.61s]  Place there, but I'm not gonna do that yet. Hold on. I feel like there might be something else
[4693.09s -> 4715.90s]  Wait, yeah a lot of danger over here though. What is that thing? Oh
[4716.62s -> 4724.18s]  That's weird. Oh this thing pukes. What is that doing?
[4725.63s -> 4742.14s]  Goodness, everybody be careful. What is this thing? What the fuck? Alright, so what is this?
[4742.66s -> 4748.81s]  Bro, that thing is disgusting
[4749.37s -> 4756.14s]  Boy new fruits. Ooh
[4756.22s -> 4770.98s]  Wait, okay. Let's do it allows the treatment to produce a song that causes the click ball to follow them
[4771.14s -> 4812.18s]  Yeah, but I'm so even more than one. All right, cool. What is it? Glick Bowl? Can I go any deeper? Is that it? That's it?
[4815.15s -> 4837.19s]  Wow, what's that? Oh my god. What else do I need to do with this? Can I activate this or what?
[4837.19s -> 4844.18s]  What's this here for? I wonder why is this activated cube hole? Ah
[4845.58s -> 4853.12s]  That's right. Okay. I want that egg the things are gonna get out of the way is the big guy a Glick Bowl
[4854.30s -> 4856.30s]  Possibly, but I don't really want to find out
[4857.76s -> 4867.35s]  All right, the attractive cube in there
[4876.97s -> 4886.82s]  The trebum felt a great power flowing through this cave, but they were not afraid
[4887.50s -> 4890.24s]  The power felt familiar
[4890.96s -> 4892.52s]  even friendly
[4892.52s -> 4897.26s]  These glowing structures were the work of their ancestors
[4897.66s -> 4899.75s]  puzzle
[4899.75s -> 4905.71s]  They water any food too. Okay
[4906.67s -> 4922.19s]  Well, we're gonna suck up all this shit. I turn them on water storage increase your maximum water storage
[4922.63s -> 4923.55s]  capacity
[4923.55s -> 4931.27s]  These are upgrades cool. Okay
[4935.33s -> 4942.44s]  They all cost six right do this
[4942.44s -> 4958.45s]  I wonder if I should hold on to this to get another friend maximum health
[4958.69s -> 4981.85s]  It's two in the attractive cube evolve into the larger more attractive cube, baby
[4981.85s -> 4998.76s]  I don't know. We'll find out soon enough. Alright, so I have seven. I think that's all there is here. What's this one?
[4998.76s -> 5018.84s]  Oh the maximum number of Trebum how many can we have now like we need that?
[5019.00s -> 5039.57s]  That's maximum and have more family members didn't click on one. He's the size of the stamina wheel probably health
[5039.57s -> 5058.08s]  I want to blow through on my on my material though. You do it twice twice or save it just once
[5058.08s -> 5060.45s]  I'm happy with that. All right
[5060.45s -> 5075.55s]  I wonder if I lose access to this place because isn't this gonna get destroyed this thing's about to get annihilated water
[5075.55s -> 5087.69s]  Yeah, good water. How we on food who has food?
[5092.72s -> 5120.21s]  None of you have anything save the game. I think it actually is saving right now. Where's my fifth these crystals, too
[5120.25s -> 5123.99s]  Alright, there's this food there's water and then there are crystals
[5124.21s -> 5132.16s]  What the fuck are these for right? Like what is this for? It's got to be something to do with this
[5132.16s -> 5158.66s]  Is even in the compendium memory cluster contains a fragment of a story about a culture hero called
[5159.28s -> 5180.74s]  Naka who was cast into the underworld by Chris. This is is this it? Yeah. Okay. So does this really do anything food?
[5181.34s -> 5188.89s]  Creatures some memory cluster. I think it's just they're on
[5189.25s -> 5211.23s]  Or in the water, I mean they're cool-looking but I don't think they do anything. I think we're good eat one
[5211.31s -> 5223.61s]  I'm not sure you can that's right. You're not even let's go
[5223.79s -> 5229.57s]  You're probably gonna need 30 of those in the last five minutes of the story true
[5229.81s -> 5238.56s]  What's the objective of the game? The objective of this game is you are these little creatures and there is an eternal
[5238.82s -> 5251.09s]  Death wall that is slowly destroying everything and you need to outrun it and live. All right, we're good
[5251.41s -> 5270.01s]  Was that what the fuck is that? All right, I'm getting nervous. I gotta get out of here. All right, I got an egg
[5270.53s -> 5289.18s]  Check over here. How we doing on food? We're all right, but eat pretty good
[5289.46s -> 5306.31s]  Just checking just suck up a bunch of bullshit and make sure to eat it. That's the play. There we are. All right, the
[5306.99s -> 5308.99s]  Objective is over here
[5309.19s -> 5326.38s]  Where straight ahead I got plenty of water plenty food a cube is so attractive speed run the game
[5326.82s -> 5333.58s]  Speed run in the game is I'm sure there's a rolling speed mutation. You probably just run as well
[5334.18s -> 5355.14s]  Yep, a new friend. I don't activate it yet. Yeah, this I'm sure this I don't like that thing at all
[5355.66s -> 5367.79s]  There's two of them to that incubator was over here, right? It's way somewhere
[5368.47s -> 5376.07s]  You can't roll
[5376.07s -> 5402.32s]  Where was it? Where I think it wasn't this far. Was it this far?
[5407.19s -> 5417.37s]  It was definitely this far
[5417.93s -> 5429.64s]  Where is it you have a map are those on the map is it right there is that that one
[5429.64s -> 5442.77s]  Is that what that is on the map go to the bruhs, huh? What do you mean go to the bruh?
[5450.10s -> 5458.81s]  Listen, what is that? All right, there's something. All right. I'm getting overwhelmed. Hold on
[5458.93s -> 5466.62s]  We need to open this and then I'm going in that hole. All right, there it is. Oh
[5466.62s -> 5469.94s]  Oh
[5472.18s -> 5485.23s]  Go this way go this way go this way go this way go this way the monsters are fucking weird in this game
[5485.31s -> 5512.62s]  He's exactly in the area. I need to be in get out of here. Goon. Oh, okay. Goon. Oh, let's go
[5512.70s -> 5528.06s]  What do we have six going in this hole? All right, the hole is over here. Hope this does not kill us. It'd be very sad
[5528.38s -> 5543.66s]  You guys ready? Whoa
[5543.66s -> 5547.58s]  Don't wait for others when entering or exiting small caves jump pads a moving plant
[5547.58s -> 5552.81s]  They move on their own. It will follow you. I want to look at this though. There's like something up here
[5557.26s -> 5563.85s]  Can I touch that or something?
[5564.01s -> 5571.70s]  Okay, so this is a jump pad
[5571.70s -> 5583.82s]  Huh? Are you all right? We'll gull need more leadership. We're perfectly fine
[5584.22s -> 5609.24s]  What do you mean need more leadership? What does that mean? We're not smart enough need more leadership. What?
[5613.54s -> 5614.58s]  Ooh
[5614.58s -> 5638.26s]  Something new new shit in here. Uh you all right. This is just health nothing else in there the upgrade thing
[5642.44s -> 5644.44s]  party full need upgrade
[5648.54s -> 5656.62s]  No, wait this he's they're gonna die down here. What do we do about this?
[5665.51s -> 5686.94s]  Will you be able to jump higher and have the turtle show curious? I think this is the leader you need to kill them
[5688.76s -> 5695.64s]  I don't think so. I feel so bad. I really want this one. Um, how much was it?
[5695.88s -> 5702.84s]  I'm gonna buy it. I'm buying it. I don't care if it's a waste. I want this friend
[5719.83s -> 5744.82s]  This is kind of hard to get out of here. Okay, i'm rescuing that one. Oh, I won't have enough. That's right
[5745.22s -> 5750.82s]  It's gonna be like four to upgrade and then it's probably gonna be four or five to get them
[5750.90s -> 5762.70s]  It's four will I have enough to free them the question you have six
[5766.79s -> 5782.70s]  I don't know if i'm gonna be able to do it. I think I just have to move on this game music on
[5782.86s -> 5795.27s]  Yeah, it should be that better. Maybe we're just too low. You should just try. All right
[5795.27s -> 5798.63s]  What if I waste all my stardust or whatever the hell this stuff is? All right
[5800.17s -> 5818.06s]  Uh, fine. We'll do it. Why is this closed?
[5822.07s -> 5827.22s]  It's locked off now
[5827.22s -> 5831.08s]  We can't go back in
[5831.08s -> 5834.16s]  Unfortunate there's a hole in the ground
[5838.29s -> 5842.71s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, what? What? No, I think I don't think I can get back in
[5844.87s -> 5848.77s]  Oh in the hole you jumped out of
[5849.25s -> 5858.26s]  the hole I jumped out of is where the
[5858.26s -> 5860.26s]  There's just a little cave with that pink guy
[5861.70s -> 5864.26s]  Upgrade rooms are locked when you exit. Oh
[5864.98s -> 5866.82s]  It's too bad
[5866.82s -> 5872.50s]  That's too bad. I'm sorry. And I mean are we willing to sacrifice somebody? I don't know if i'm willing to sacrifice anybody
[5872.90s -> 5877.84s]  Should we sacrifice the new green guy?
[5881.03s -> 5883.72s]  But we just got gunu
[5883.80s -> 5885.80s]  Gunu doesn't deserve to die
[5890.68s -> 5892.04s]  Kill gunu
[5892.04s -> 5892.92s]  What?
[5892.92s -> 5895.35s]  I can't believe i'm hearing this
[5895.35s -> 5898.71s]  kill gunu
[5898.71s -> 5901.19s]  Sack. No, we can't even get uh
[5905.03s -> 5918.21s]  I'm not gonna kill the sexy cube. Are you out of your mind? Um, all right, i'm making a decision here. I'm sorry. No
[5920.07s -> 5923.41s]  No gunu stays. I'm sorry
[5923.89s -> 5926.39s]  uh pink pink
[5927.35s -> 5929.19s]  Trebum, i'm sorry
[5929.19s -> 5933.25s]  I've made my decision
[5933.25s -> 5935.25s]  All right, we're gonna go this way left
[5936.21s -> 5940.12s]  over here
[5940.12s -> 5944.63s]  We yeah, we need water. I'm gonna eat and have water. Where's the water guy?
[5945.27s -> 5947.27s]  You turn this into water
[5947.43s -> 5962.40s]  Thank you. Okay. What else you got? You have like power shit eat that eat that
[5965.76s -> 5972.58s]  Uh eat that that was a lot of water. Holy shit. Okay
[5976.44s -> 5989.51s]  Turn that poop into wine. All right, I think we're good goal is over here. I'm gonna take the turtle
[5992.05s -> 6005.16s]  Hey, i'm gonna take hey big raid coming in from connery's pants. What's up connor? Welcome everybody
[6006.44s -> 6014.61s]  Thanks to the raid. We're currently playing the eternal cylinder. It's pretty fun. Hope you had a good stream
[6014.77s -> 6021.01s]  Just chilling out for a little bit playing it and I need to just get a uh, we gotta go now
[6021.17s -> 6022.61s]  We gotta go now
[6022.61s -> 6024.61s]  Go go go go go do not get picked up
[6025.25s -> 6029.01s]  Okay, we have to we get we're moving and we are not we're not looking at anything
[6029.33s -> 6032.61s]  I'm not gonna look at how scary that is and that i'm just crossing the path right now
[6033.49s -> 6035.91s]  Get away from puke
[6035.91s -> 6038.53s]  Everything is okay
[6038.53s -> 6041.28s]  Here comes the wall
[6041.28s -> 6043.72s]  Everyone is chasing us
[6043.88s -> 6047.96s]  Okay
[6047.96s -> 6065.44s]  Everybody's still intact. Yep. We're gonna be really hungry after this get out of there get out of there. I got you. Don't worry
[6070.44s -> 6071.48s]  Oh
[6071.48s -> 6074.44s]  What do I do? It is a car. It's a car
[6075.16s -> 6080.60s]  Is it gonna wake up? I don't want to fucking be here to find out
[6086.42s -> 6089.06s]  Don't wake up was this strange being
[6089.78s -> 6091.78s]  Half flesh half metal
[6092.34s -> 6098.47s]  The trebum felt an old distant horror as if they remembered their own destruction
[6100.07s -> 6102.31s]  Something about this creature was very
[6103.11s -> 6104.23s]  very
[6104.23s -> 6106.23s]  Wrong, so don't wake it up
[6106.63s -> 6111.76s]  The hand behind the car that is weird
[6112.56s -> 6116.15s]  I don't think we want to wake this
[6117.03s -> 6122.08s]  I'm not going to
[6122.08s -> 6124.72s]  Oh, it's it's the influence of the three fingers
[6126.79s -> 6129.67s]  Perhaps the creature would wake up with a loud noise
[6130.39s -> 6133.35s]  If we want that to happen, I don't really want to do that
[6136.04s -> 6140.26s]  I need oh wait. What is this?
[6140.26s -> 6142.98s]  There's a hole behind it, but just let me what is this?
[6145.99s -> 6169.00s]  I pull the plug here. Can we pick this up or something? I don't know you need to eat something. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep
[6178.88s -> 6181.44s]  But anyways, uh, thanks for the ray conor. Hope you're doing good
[6183.25s -> 6185.46s]  Yeah, we're just chilling out
[6185.46s -> 6189.09s]  Just hanging out
[6189.09s -> 6190.85s]  Who told you to do that?
[6190.85s -> 6192.69s]  Who did that?
[6192.69s -> 6196.05s]  Who told you to do that? It's awake now. We need to eat first. What are you thinking?
[6197.32s -> 6199.32s]  Why would you blow the horn? Who did that?
[6201.88s -> 6205.40s]  Trapped on all sides by deep pools of poisonous gas
[6205.96s -> 6209.02s]  The trebum needed to find a way to escape this monstrosity
[6209.64s -> 6213.00s]  I didn't want that to happen to use the creature's own weight
[6213.48s -> 6216.16s]  to lower the bridge
[6216.24s -> 6218.24s]  Okay, first of all
[6218.32s -> 6220.72s]  So you need to run over here and
[6222.31s -> 6228.20s]  and smash into this
[6228.20s -> 6230.92s]  It was gunu. He betrayed you. What's wrong with us?
[6231.48s -> 6235.80s]  What what's wrong with us? What's wrong? What's happening? What's wrong with us?
[6239.25s -> 6240.29s]  No
[6240.29s -> 6246.77s]  I did it guys. I can't look behind me restart restart restart restart. Everyone's gonna fucking die down here restart restart
[6246.85s -> 6251.25s]  No, everyone's like coughing and choking. How do we get out? How do we get out of here? How do we get out of here?
[6261.57s -> 6263.57s]  What the fuck? It's so hard
[6267.41s -> 6270.85s]  God dang gunu. God damn it gunu. We were not ready
[6271.33s -> 6273.01s]  Gunu we weren't ready
[6273.01s -> 6277.43s]  You just wiped out the entire fucking family gunu
[6287.54s -> 6290.58s]  You blew the why would you blow the horn? I wasn't prepared
[6296.15s -> 6298.69s]  Okay
[6298.69s -> 6302.72s]  Ban gunu from the guild
[6302.80s -> 6307.12s]  All right. So the idea is we have to wake up the month. Wait, not yet
[6307.76s -> 6314.13s]  Let me eat first
[6314.13s -> 6316.13s]  Do not blow your horn
[6316.92s -> 6348.24s]  Just wait get out of here. Just trying to get it full stomach. All right, uh, I want the water
[6348.72s -> 6350.32s]  I want you to produce water
[6350.32s -> 6353.04s]  Take a bunch of junk
[6353.04s -> 6365.54s]  Okay gunu fight back. Wait, it wasn't gunu
[6366.10s -> 6369.54s]  Gunu doesn't have a horn
[6369.54s -> 6370.82s]  It was vu
[6370.82s -> 6374.95s]  It was this dumbass
[6374.95s -> 6377.38s]  Okay. Well, whatever
[6377.38s -> 6381.03s]  So the strategy here is you gotta wake up this thing
[6381.75s -> 6383.75s]  And have it run over here
[6383.75s -> 6386.24s]  That's I guess what i'm gonna do and let's try it
[6401.16s -> 6403.16s]  Won't wake up from this. Why not?
[6404.80s -> 6406.32s]  Go go go go
[6406.32s -> 6417.72s]  Trapped on all sides by deep pools of poisonous gas
[6418.20s -> 6421.96s]  The trebum needed to find a way to escape this monstrosity. Oh here
[6422.52s -> 6425.24s]  Perhaps there was a way to use the creature's own weight
[6425.80s -> 6427.80s]  To lower the bridge
[6428.63s -> 6430.87s]  Oh fuck. All right. We got it. We got it. Go go go go go
[6434.42s -> 6436.16s]  one by one
[6436.16s -> 6440.56s]  The oh light cruelly burned away the trebum's ability stop
[6440.72s -> 6446.64s]  How do I stop this? The elder had warned them about the evil light of the cylinder's servants the light
[6446.88s -> 6449.84s]  Now they knew what kind of creature to avoid
[6450.56s -> 6455.20s]  Get out of the poison. We all did we make it safely?
[6458.34s -> 6460.34s]  One two, three four. You guys all right?
[6460.82s -> 6464.68s]  All right. Take a break
[6464.68s -> 6466.20s]  Hold on. We need to take a break
[6466.20s -> 6471.12s]  So we don't have any more abilities
[6472.52s -> 6474.52s]  We don't have an attractive cube anymore
[6476.29s -> 6479.04s]  Okay
[6479.04s -> 6486.40s]  So we now we kind of start we start the process up again. All right ruin the run
[6487.48s -> 6489.48s]  No sexy cube
[6490.82s -> 6492.82s]  Attractive cube. All right
[6494.40s -> 6497.48s]  How we doing we need
[6497.56s -> 6498.76s]  Up here
[6498.76s -> 6503.14s]  There's still space to explore over here. So let's go ahead and just see what we have
[6505.33s -> 6507.33s]  That weird car is no longer over here
[6515.72s -> 6517.72s]  just scanning the field
[6517.80s -> 6526.08s]  See what's here
[6526.08s -> 6529.60s]  I wonder if you can eventually kill those things or fight back or attack or something
[6533.42s -> 6544.95s]  Interesting. What's that behind you? We're good. I mean, yeah, there's that thing but
[6547.36s -> 6553.96s]  We're getting out of here. What's this?
[6555.76s -> 6557.36s]  Revival shrine
[6557.36s -> 6562.79s]  These special ruins scattered around the world allow you to store or revive fellow trebum
[6563.11s -> 6566.36s]  Storing trebum can be useful if you reach the maximum party limit
[6566.68s -> 6570.20s]  Who would like to call upon some of your trebum during a later stage of the adventure?
[6570.60s -> 6577.64s]  Reviving lost trebum comes at a cost. The cost is based on how many mutations the trebum had when it perished
[6578.76s -> 6581.19s]  Okay
[6581.19s -> 6584.15s]  When the trebum stepped on the strange device
[6584.63s -> 6589.75s]  Interesting ancient memory came back to them a memory of long ago
[6590.07s -> 6596.74s]  Where the cities of their people still stood and the fight against the cylinder was not yet lost
[6597.38s -> 6599.51s]  So we got those days
[6599.51s -> 6603.67s]  A very smart trebum had found a way of cheating very smart trebum
[6604.15s -> 6610.71s]  Of stealing stuff in the cloud to absorb and to reshape and being uploaded to amazon web service
[6610.79s -> 6615.41s]  Revive their fallen friends or send others to a hidden place
[6616.24s -> 6620.72s]  And it was also by this device that a link had been forged
[6621.30s -> 6625.86s]  They have so many g names opened to the voice that spoke within them
[6632.93s -> 6634.93s]  Put gunu in the hole
[6637.27s -> 6648.96s]  Should we all right gunu is in the cloud, but that's kind of unfair
[6650.20s -> 6658.29s]  No, we don't want to store gunu. Everyone's safe
[6658.61s -> 6666.80s]  I think the whole point of storing is if they have a certain mutation that you don't want to lose
[6668.68s -> 6684.04s]  But nobody has a mutation. We all got it all just kind of gripped away. That's cool. That's how that works
[6684.12s -> 6687.14s]  All right, does that does that thing does it look like anything on the map?
[6689.44s -> 6705.04s]  Well, not much further to get to whatever that is. I wonder if there's anything else store someone away and save the pink one
[6706.20s -> 6712.82s]  I really hate to say this the pink one is gone pink one is over there far over there
[6713.30s -> 6725.94s]  Very dead get some water. Oh, hold on. Wasn't somebody supposed to be finding the fish ones. Here we go
[6727.80s -> 6735.00s]  All right, who do we want to be? Uh the big uh, big fat one blue
[6737.17s -> 6751.52s]  I'm not it's just storage. I think make gunu the fat one. Why it was blue before fine. We'll do okay gunu. Here you go
[6756.69s -> 6778.16s]  All right, gunu now gunu is everybody's favorite character all these like omega lows lol lol. Ha ha ha
[6782.68s -> 6788.04s]  It's not like that. It's not even like that funny. It's just like he's just a little bigger
[6788.52s -> 6799.14s]  It's not like he's a blobfish now. All right. Oh speaking of oh, we're not generating water anymore. Okay
[6799.38s -> 6826.52s]  Well, I think i'm ready to move. Yeah, I think so unless this is a hole over here. I think it's time to move
[6827.48s -> 6835.19s]  Huge poison chasm over here. So I need to go this way that dude's built like a Hershey kiss
[6835.59s -> 6854.63s]  Yeah, I see it. All right. I'm going for it. All right prepare. I need to go there. We ready
[6855.72s -> 6888.47s]  All right, everyone's had food. Everyone's had water. Oh, this one's moving a little faster. Nothing here. Good. All right
[6888.95s -> 6926.24s]  Oh catch your breath. Oh, fuck. It's actually kind of close go hurry up. Oh, is it all right get in get in get in all of you
[6926.96s -> 6930.34s]  Oh, thank goodness. Okay
[6930.34s -> 6931.46s]  Jesus
[6931.46s -> 6938.37s]  One two, three, four five
[6941.25s -> 6942.61s]  What happened?
[6942.61s -> 6948.21s]  What happened? What happened? What happened? Why did that happen? Why is still going cylinder roared with fury?
[6949.22s -> 6951.96s]  The voice of their memories spoke with great urgency
[6952.74s -> 6955.54s]  The trebum had to be very careful now
[6955.78s -> 6961.22s]  Oh god, um would lash out of the land, but it would not let them run too far
[6962.60s -> 6967.72s]  To survive they would have to stay in the eye of the storm, huh?
[6969.27s -> 6971.03s]  Where is that?
[6971.03s -> 6980.77s]  Stay in the what does that mean? What's that? I don't know. I I don't understand what that's supposed to mean
[6991.75s -> 6993.11s]  Stay close
[6993.11s -> 6996.55s]  The torso is producing electrical barrier that you cannot pass out running lightning strikes. It's not possible
[6997.76s -> 7000.45s]  What do we do?
[7000.45s -> 7002.45s]  You can't get far ahead of it. Wait, what?
[7003.17s -> 7010.90s]  And we need to eat something
[7010.90s -> 7012.74s]  Do I have to stay close?
[7012.74s -> 7017.89s]  You have to be between the lightning and the cylinder
[7019.73s -> 7022.63s]  Oh my goodness
[7022.63s -> 7025.35s]  All right. Eat quick quick quick eat eat eat eat go go go
[7033.96s -> 7040.04s]  Not that close
[7040.04s -> 7041.64s]  This is so much
[7041.64s -> 7047.70s]  God
[7047.70s -> 7049.70s]  All right. It's all right. Any more food
[7057.06s -> 7060.76s]  Who is that thing? What is that? Let's find out
[7086.92s -> 7088.12s]  plenty of water
[7088.12s -> 7093.67s]  Everything's okay
[7093.67s -> 7096.50s]  Uh
[7096.50s -> 7098.50s]  What is this? Can I do anything with this?
[7098.74s -> 7101.49s]  I don't think so. I'm just checking
[7118.12s -> 7123.16s]  This is so scary. They're not gonna eat us right? Not right now. That would be really really annoying
[7126.04s -> 7128.20s]  Sacrifice gunu and run to the cylinder
[7128.92s -> 7132.48s]  I wonder if this counts
[7132.48s -> 7138.80s]  Is this gonna shatter?
[7138.80s -> 7149.03s]  What do we just eat?
[7149.03s -> 7155.30s]  Lightning is lightning is striking me
[7155.78s -> 7157.78s]  Gunu must survive
[7159.12s -> 7160.61s]  Oh
[7160.61s -> 7162.61s]  Back up back up back. Don't go too far
[7162.85s -> 7172.90s]  I want one of these flowers so bad
[7175.09s -> 7194.48s]  As frightening and surprising as this enormous creature was that trebum felt a sense of relief to see it descend
[7194.88s -> 7200.47s]  From the sky what the holy shit a celestial being that'd been told to seek
[7201.62s -> 7207.40s]  Perhaps it held an answer to their troubles. Oh poison
[7208.12s -> 7213.83s]  Okay, I should give everybody one of these then. Yeah, let's all take these here
[7215.09s -> 7233.57s]  Everybody grab one. Oh shit. I'm sorry. I'm trying to give you this
[7234.37s -> 7244.42s]  I have to imagine everybody should have it
[7244.42s -> 7267.06s]  Hopefully it doesn't uh overwrite what gunu has already so there how many people still need it. We have one two three
[7274.44s -> 7276.44s]  I ain't fucking around anymore
[7280.47s -> 7281.68s]  Elf
[7281.68s -> 7283.84s]  As they approached the colossal creature
[7284.40s -> 7289.44s]  Their optimism faded why it did not seem to like them at all
[7289.92s -> 7293.76s]  What and now they realized what terrible danger they were in
[7294.80s -> 7299.76s]  If this creature guarded the way to some holy place, then that place must lie below it
[7300.90s -> 7302.74s]  And being so large
[7302.74s -> 7306.82s]  The creature most likely could not see what was in front of it. It just killed that motherfucker
[7306.90s -> 7311.38s]  All right. Hold on. We need so perhaps the size of the trebum was an advantage after all
[7312.76s -> 7317.16s]  Perhaps okay, they could reach the platform right under the serpent's head
[7318.36s -> 7322.28s]  Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop
[7326.15s -> 7332.53s]  The trouhalla has an electric attack that strikes if you remain in its line of sight for too long. It had to be in cover
[7333.09s -> 7336.74s]  All right. Everybody has to have the poison on
[7336.90s -> 7338.42s]  It's just the way it works
[7338.42s -> 7346.36s]  Come here gunu get out of line of sight who's in line of sight right now. Stop
[7359.32s -> 7365.56s]  Get over here. We need food. I'm not going over there to have food everybody have um poison gas mask on
[7367.97s -> 7370.23s]  Uh, you don't
[7370.23s -> 7390.32s]  Grutemu, okay grutemu. There is an egg
[7393.32s -> 7397.40s]  All right. We don't want that to happen to us. That was awful. So don't all right
[7398.42s -> 7402.13s]  uh
[7402.13s -> 7404.61s]  Shit
[7404.61s -> 7406.61s]  There's an egg over here, but I don't
[7408.20s -> 7410.20s]  Rotem need more leadership
[7412.32s -> 7415.14s]  Fuck okay
[7415.94s -> 7419.22s]  Move move move move move move out of the way out of the way out of the way out of the way
[7420.39s -> 7427.17s]  Let it get zapped. Okay, good
[7427.96s -> 7429.00s]  um
[7429.00s -> 7437.92s]  Gunu, I want you to take point here. Everybody has to follow gunu. We need food. We need to eat. All right, follow me
[7440.32s -> 7443.09s]  What happened?
[7443.09s -> 7452.39s]  Fuck. Okay. Hold on. This is something. What is this? Who wants it?
[7454.53s -> 7456.53s]  one two three four
[7456.61s -> 7459.92s]  Five
[7459.92s -> 7461.36s]  All right, you eat this
[7461.36s -> 7478.29s]  We gotta figure we need to eat we figure out this is electricity. Um, something about like, I don't know eat it legless
[7481.28s -> 7482.24s]  um
[7482.24s -> 7487.88s]  Well, this one dies
[7489.25s -> 7491.25s]  No
[7491.33s -> 7496.50s]  It's okay. It's all right. We will always remember you we will always
[7497.56s -> 7502.56s]  Remember all the jokes you told us. We'll always remember you. Um
[7503.76s -> 7506.04s]  it's been real
[7506.04s -> 7509.64s]  you're super nice and we all love you and
[7513.62s -> 7518.55s]  Make it one two. Where are they? Where are they?
[7522.29s -> 7531.70s]  One two, three, four five. Wait, they grew back
[7532.26s -> 7543.97s]  No, we're all here. Wait, it was you. Is it maybe it's a temporary thing. What are you doing?
[7545.88s -> 7546.84s]  Ah
[7546.84s -> 7550.85s]  Why is it targeting him?
[7550.85s -> 7557.00s]  All right. Everybody relax. I need to have a game. Why is it targeting him? We need to eat now
[7558.15s -> 7560.79s]  All right, you go get it. You're the one that's being targeted for no reason
[7562.07s -> 7572.12s]  You gotta collect the food
[7572.28s -> 7583.14s]  Gunu go for it
[7595.67s -> 7597.40s]  Okay, oh
[7597.40s -> 7610.87s]  We need water now. Where the hell are we gonna get water? Everybody can let's all right
[7611.11s -> 7618.20s]  We gotta go we have to go for it hide in the poison. I believe we can't get whoever's in that egg
[7618.28s -> 7620.28s]  It's just not possible. It's not gonna happen
[7621.14s -> 7621.94s]  um
[7621.94s -> 7623.30s]  Let's go down
[7623.30s -> 7646.23s]  Everybody should be safe down here. Okay, we need water bad
[7646.79s -> 7664.20s]  Can we go in this you can't find other trouble return to the platform from time to time other wandering friends
[7664.76s -> 7666.76s]  Might have reached it on their own
[7667.78s -> 7690.98s]  What does that mean what's the egg relieved at having bested the guardian?
[7691.06s -> 7695.22s]  I have a full party trebum now found themselves seeking the help they had been promised
[7696.32s -> 7699.28s]  Who would answer their questions in this place?
[7700.00s -> 7703.54s]  You ate the egg
[7703.54s -> 7709.06s]  Well, yeah, I mean it's I I I have a full party though. I have six um trebums one two, three four five
[7709.14s -> 7713.46s]  So yeah, I can't get any more even if even if I got that egg and hatched it. I couldn't
[7714.77s -> 7727.35s]  You're not gonna die from that right? Okay. What is that? What just happened?
[7729.36s -> 7736.08s]  Uh, i'm going down the magic crystals
[7739.44s -> 7741.44s]  interesting
[7743.60s -> 7745.60s]  Interesting what does this do?
[7747.30s -> 7764.05s]  You try it light. Oh you turn them into a torch
[7765.62s -> 7770.36s]  Okay, that's funny. I think we should only have one person do that
[7772.48s -> 7808.77s]  I don't think we should have more than one starlight. We're pretty good on food. I love this area. It's very uh,
[7809.09s -> 7822.34s]  What does it remind me of? It's like fraggle rock. This was what was this one again?
[7824.07s -> 7828.07s]  Oh, don't die. Yeah, don't take this. This is the you just like lose. This is like you don't have legs
[7828.07s -> 7846.85s]  All right. Yeah, I don't want that. Everybody got full water. Look at this one. We need more spots
[7847.17s -> 7863.81s]  All right, who's gonna get drowned? Save him. I can't I have a full party. What do you mean? What the fuck?
[7863.81s -> 7877.49s]  What the fuck what you need to put them in storage? All right, we are going to put the the
[7878.29s -> 7880.29s]  Lamp we're gonna put the lamp
[7880.45s -> 7883.01s]  Into storage because we're not gonna need the lamp anymore
[7883.25s -> 7892.39s]  Brutemu the lamp and anytime we need a light we will pull Brutemu out of storage
[7892.63s -> 7926.63s]  That's definitely what you're supposed to be doing. Wait, there's a lamp. We need to you. Okay, you gotta be the front anything else
[7929.62s -> 7930.58s]  Oh
[7930.58s -> 7941.38s]  Look up there. Can I make the jump when you have legs? You have legs you ate that weird shit just up here too
[7941.62s -> 7955.57s]  Do you have to have the specific? Oh, this is huge. Actually. Gunu is useless. Gunu is a backpack
[7956.45s -> 7972.15s]  They're definitely not useless. All right, what's in here? That looks whatever it is. It looks delicious. Oh, no
[7972.47s -> 7979.99s]  There you are over here, please. I got a few things for you to store
[7987.52s -> 7996.32s]  This I think is a full heel you can just open the inventory. That's true
[7996.64s -> 8010.24s]  So this is a full heel full water full food. What is this? Should Gunu eat the light?
[8010.32s -> 8017.11s]  I wonder will it is it will it take over his bigness or will it just be a will he just glow in the dark?
[8017.35s -> 8023.92s]  I feel like this one should be the lamp the biggest character
[8024.16s -> 8045.96s]  Okay, I actually like i'm not that happy about this because Gunu now is gonna look like this until he doesn't
[8050.93s -> 8061.06s]  Well, we got what we wanted and let's go even with the light the maze was difficult to traverse
[8062.12s -> 8065.72s]  Was there some clue in the structures on the walls?
[8066.04s -> 8073.78s]  I think was the part of sand on the ground meant to help them perhaps others had walked in this place long ago
[8074.58s -> 8078.50s]  And tried to leave a path for those who would one day follow them
[8079.06s -> 8090.48s]  This is an arrow, right? I mean these are arrows. They put arrows. They're very smart something here
[8097.27s -> 8108.72s]  I want more people to be able to jump. Let's get out of here. How we doing on food good
[8108.88s -> 8123.41s]  Yeah, how do we get out of here? This is where we came in
[8123.65s -> 8132.40s]  So why did it was like oh traverse make sure you know the correct way all the large arrows on the way
[8132.40s -> 8159.99s]  Didn't I do that? Oh, I didn't how did I follow them the wrong way something I can do. Yeah, follow the large arrows
[8160.07s -> 8190.45s]  This is a snail. What significance do the snails have? These are big chunky rocks. I break them. I can't all right
[8190.53s -> 8202.13s]  So that's interesting. What's with the slug? We don't have a cube
[8202.61s -> 8233.84s]  Unfortunately, maybe we'll get a cube in a minute here you get out of here. This is our territory somebody kill them
[8244.45s -> 8248.52s]  Well definitely wants us to have a jump power. I have a couple people that already have it
[8253.60s -> 8262.66s]  Uh, I guess i'll give it to more of you probably have it dude. It's so dark
[8263.46s -> 8290.02s]  Where is it? Oh, it's over here. I eat this get some legs. Can I give the legs to gunu?
[8292.20s -> 8298.82s]  I feel like it's gonna override. It's probably gonna override the um
[8299.81s -> 8307.54s]  Bigness I think it's legs not body
[8318.12s -> 8324.79s]  Save and try it. Well, it's worth a shot. Let's see if it is just like legs
[8325.27s -> 8327.89s]  Maybe it doesn't replace anything
[8327.89s -> 8352.92s]  That's not what I want. No, stop. Let me do this. Okay, so it is it's legs body
[8353.64s -> 8363.30s]  Skin and nose. I think of the different ones. Okay, cool. None of these
[8365.00s -> 8388.13s]  What was this one? I forget what this one does zero for me to see amber. Oh, it's the third eye
[8388.45s -> 8393.78s]  Give it to gunu. Do you want gunu just to be completely stacked?
[8394.10s -> 8418.12s]  Okay, if gunu dies, it's a problem like actually a problem. I think that's good
[8418.60s -> 8447.83s]  He just gets uglier and uglier. Hey, don't say that how dare you fill up on water
[8448.07s -> 8453.70s]  Yeah, so the reason why why cube didn't work is it's changed his body
[8453.94s -> 8459.70s]  So we gotta keep that in mind. I'm going to forget every single one of these. So please help
[8462.37s -> 8505.08s]  I think we should have a swimmer you swim. There we go crystals. I got a lot of these
[8505.08s -> 8516.87s]  I need to spend them. Should everybody just glow in the dark temporarily. They're not dying. Are they wait?
[8516.87s -> 8536.04s]  What's going on? Are they okay? I need light. I think it's all right. I'm gonna make a couple more people
[8544.72s -> 8559.32s]  They can't jump that eventually I can teleport them. I just can't see there we go. Everybody should be there
[8559.32s -> 8583.22s]  They are okay crystals. All right that way. Well, hold on. What's this? Oh, it's cube. It's a cube
[8583.30s -> 8617.99s]  All right, who should be a cube you boo. You're the cube now gunu can't be a cube. Okay. All right somebody else's
[8618.39s -> 8624.53s]  Uh, you're the biggest one. So just go now. That is not an attractive cube. It's just a cube
[8625.99s -> 8634.68s]  It was a place where somebody could go. I wonder if i'm gonna wrap around now. Yeah, okay
[8634.84s -> 8640.20s]  They're cool. Oh, it's a place where you could go
[8640.76s -> 8669.92s]  Where was it? Yes. All right cube get in there. Whoa
[8670.48s -> 8672.84s]  Okay
[8672.84s -> 8675.65s]  a moa
[8675.65s -> 8692.37s]  Ball now what encountering another elder was a happy moment the trebum asked how they might survive the cylinder and the elder replied
[8693.03s -> 8697.94s]  I can feel your fear little one ever since this cataclysm began
[8697.94s -> 8703.90s]  We have been seeking ways to stop it, but the cylinder is relentless and indestructible
[8705.24s -> 8707.72s]  It will consume everything in its path
[8708.52s -> 8713.48s]  So perhaps what we need to do is go behind it
[8714.28s -> 8718.28s]  I have discovered a mutation that allows us to rise into the sky
[8719.19s -> 8725.03s]  You must seek a weeping tree from which grows a special fruit that floats as it becomes ripe
[8725.97s -> 8730.31s]  It is the key to the transformation I have undergone with it
[8730.88s -> 8734.16s]  You can use geysers to float well above the cylinder's height
[8734.95s -> 8740.07s]  My only regret is that I have grown too old and weak to help you with this task
[8741.03s -> 8746.07s]  If you find any glimmer of hope on the other side, remember me
[8747.35s -> 8751.94s]  farewell
[8752.02s -> 8767.54s]  All right, so there's a I have to eat a special food. Now. The question is is it on the map? No, it's a special tree
[8768.18s -> 8795.08s]  Get us to float can we use this thing? Wait, somebody's dead who died?
[8795.64s -> 8800.29s]  Somebody's dead
[8800.37s -> 8811.03s]  This is hurting us
[8811.03s -> 8825.40s]  No, guna's not dead. He didn't just die somewhere. No way. Where's everybody?
[8828.76s -> 8847.68s]  Show gunu on cam. Hold on. All right. Yeah, what the fuck is everybody this guna?
[8850.60s -> 8854.93s]  Um, what are we doing? I can't float through that
[8855.57s -> 8863.70s]  But I found this tree. Well, where's it? We can't go up that way
[8865.70s -> 8872.36s]  As we just go out this way
[8874.98s -> 8879.30s]  Sadness and fear filled the trebum's hearts as they left the elder's cave
[8879.62s -> 8883.96s]  Stand by their only path to salvation was full of uncertainty
[8884.58s -> 8887.22s]  I know I could go out the door. I just didn't know what someone wanted to get here
[8887.46s -> 8893.94s]  They had seen lurking behind the cylinder casting a dark shadow over this glimpse of light
[8896.74s -> 8906.79s]  Okay, so just a big log rolling
[8910.66s -> 8915.70s]  Interesting the trebum had never seen this mysterious tree the elder spoke of
[8917.57s -> 8921.81s]  They would have to keep moving forward and hope it lay somewhere ahead
[8922.61s -> 8925.49s]  The cylinder would give them no other choice
[8929.60s -> 8932.04s]  all right, let's get
[8932.04s -> 8933.40s]  and the
[8933.40s -> 8936.28s]  Big dragon is gone. So that's a plus
[8938.80s -> 8943.12s]  Everyone just coming to the stream right now. What would it mean big dragon? What the fuck? What are you? Yeah, man
[8943.84s -> 8950.56s]  Should have saw it and I actually might sound like i'm being sarcastic, but it actually was really cool
[8952.42s -> 8965.86s]  Okay, there's some what is this it's pointing over here. So there's that way
[8966.42s -> 8987.20s]  It's pointing over here though. Still good on food. Maybe somebody should be
[8987.82s -> 8989.12s]  tanky
[8989.12s -> 8991.49s]  Yeah
[8991.49s -> 8992.74s]  you
[8992.74s -> 9005.01s]  Wait, oh wait, I forgot. That's not the right one
[9005.73s -> 9008.45s]  Well, it's okay
[9008.45s -> 9010.45s]  You just make water
[9010.69s -> 9023.03s]  Is this food?
[9023.03s -> 9026.10s]  I wonder can I eat anything up this?
[9027.04s -> 9032.80s]  No
[9032.80s -> 9034.88s]  So correct me if i'm wrong
[9034.88s -> 9036.61s]  and
[9036.61s -> 9038.61s]  This I think this is accurate
[9038.93s -> 9043.49s]  This is made by the same team that did xeno clash. Do you remember xeno clash?
[9044.29s -> 9050.55s]  Do you remember that game?
[9050.55s -> 9052.55s]  That game was wild
[9053.76s -> 9058.56s]  They're actually making another xeno clash game. Aren't they coming out soon? I think
[9059.38s -> 9061.20s]  but same team
[9061.20s -> 9062.16s]  it
[9062.16s -> 9063.60s]  I mean that would
[9063.60s -> 9066.88s]  I mean all the character designs it looks very much like xeno clash
[9070.32s -> 9077.20s]  Whoever is there whoever is doing the character designs and the concept work for uh ace team where the xeno clash team
[9080.23s -> 9083.51s]  It's it's like next level. They're they're they're unbelievably good
[9085.73s -> 9089.89s]  Um, all right, i'm gonna go touch that wait didn't I already see this? Am I crazy?
[9090.61s -> 9095.48s]  The new xeno game looks actually really cool
[9095.80s -> 9097.80s]  Yeah, it's like a dice game
[9097.88s -> 9103.16s]  But then it turns into sort of like a third person action game after you play a game of dice or something
[9103.88s -> 9105.88s]  I'll probably play it. It looks really interesting
[9106.20s -> 9111.12s]  Did I touch this already?
[9111.12s -> 9113.60s]  Oh, yes, we're gonna store people right right right right
[9114.63s -> 9116.72s]  All right
[9116.72s -> 9119.00s]  We are gonna store
[9119.00s -> 9120.36s]  one of our
[9120.36s -> 9122.36s]  Yeah, we need to we're gonna store a lamp
[9124.34s -> 9126.34s]  Who do we want? Yeah, we're gonna store
[9128.84s -> 9132.05s]  Store gru temu
[9132.05s -> 9146.76s]  Makes sense. All right gru temu you're getting stored in case we need a lamp who knew it stays
[9148.44s -> 9157.32s]  Gua stays boo stays wog will stays. There he goes. Okay, so we have
[9157.80s -> 9162.26s]  It was kind of everyone kind of has a purpose at this point
[9169.01s -> 9178.60s]  One two, three or five. Okay, that wasn't the lamp. Yeah, it was who knew is the most important
[9178.68s -> 9192.63s]  But yeah, the most important one has to stick around two. We need two lamps in there. Ah
[9193.59s -> 9197.51s]  Get out. Well, that's you should be safe. You shouldn't be able to get over here
[9201.08s -> 9209.81s]  Get out of here. We're okay. We're in trouble something else is moving over here now. Oh my goodness
[9209.81s -> 9211.89s]  All right. No, no, go go go just get out get out get out get out
[9212.84s -> 9236.56s]  We stored one. We gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go right now. I'm going now plenty of health
[9237.91s -> 9240.66s]  Find this tree
[9240.66s -> 9241.78s]  Oh
[9241.78s -> 9244.50s]  Shit. Oh shit. Oh shit
[9245.68s -> 9246.96s]  big problem
[9246.96s -> 9248.96s]  Somebody can swim can't they who can swim?
[9249.78s -> 9252.90s]  Who can swim one of you swims who swims? Who's the swimmer?
[9254.28s -> 9255.80s]  Who swims?
[9255.80s -> 9257.56s]  Somebody swims, right?
[9257.56s -> 9258.84s]  Who swims?
[9258.84s -> 9260.82s]  Nobody swims
[9260.82s -> 9263.30s]  Nobody swims. I stored the swimmer. We're dead
[9272.29s -> 9274.29s]  I stored the swimmer
[9279.08s -> 9285.00s]  Okay, well done. Was he there? I don't think so
[9288.40s -> 9294.28s]  Oh fuck off
[9294.28s -> 9296.28s]  We told you to store the lamp
[9297.70s -> 9303.57s]  Okay, you're going in there and i'm bringing out the swimmer. What's your name?
[9306.07s -> 9315.84s]  Woog wool. All right, woog wool go in there and we'll pull the swimmer out. The thing is gonna kill all of us
[9318.71s -> 9323.38s]  Okay, woog wool going in
[9323.38s -> 9345.30s]  Grutemu coming out. Where's the swimmer? One, two, three. Wait
[9349.38s -> 9352.66s]  Wrong. I don't hold on a second. Who has the swimming ability?
[9354.85s -> 9357.99s]  It's kind of it's hard to tell
[9357.99s -> 9380.08s]  Does woog wool have swimming? I wish I could see their traits right here. None have the swimming. You lost it
[9380.32s -> 9388.32s]  How did I lose it? Didn't somebody just get it? Somebody had webbed feet, right? It is woog wool. Okay
[9391.65s -> 9394.53s]  All right. So then grutemu goes in as grutemu is just
[9395.72s -> 9398.76s]  Literally just glowing and jump. Okay, put grutemu in
[9399.32s -> 9412.42s]  Yeah, we did. We had it right the first time. Yeah, I just freaked out because I didn't realize that you had the webbed feet
[9412.50s -> 9418.39s]  All right. Let's go. All right, woog wool. Where are you? You know, you know, you know what threw me off
[9419.19s -> 9421.19s]  It was the fact that um
[9421.51s -> 9423.11s]  Woog wool is glowing
[9423.11s -> 9431.52s]  Okay, I need to take a look at the map
[9431.52s -> 9435.32s]  Oh fuck
[9435.32s -> 9438.04s]  We okay everyone. Okay. All right. I need to look at the map
[9441.89s -> 9443.89s]  I think I can just swim across this
[9444.29s -> 9447.84s]  with woog wool
[9447.84s -> 9454.56s]  I think woog wool can make it
[9454.56s -> 9457.75s]  Oh
[9457.75s -> 9459.11s]  Get away
[9459.11s -> 9470.90s]  Okay, it's moving. All right. Well, you need to eat and then you swim in over there
[9471.62s -> 9483.64s]  Come on use your trait
[9483.72s -> 9484.76s]  Yes
[9484.76s -> 9490.52s]  I think it's gonna work. Don't even look back
[9527.09s -> 9529.52s]  Okay, so we're gonna go the long way
[9530.24s -> 9532.24s]  There's not there's not enough stamina
[9534.98s -> 9537.54s]  I need to upgrade my stamina to try something like that again
[9538.18s -> 9545.09s]  So I gotta go around the water. Okay, this game is cool. I like this game. It's fun
[9546.63s -> 9547.91s]  well
[9547.91s -> 9549.91s]  Who you're gonna spawn me right here?
[9551.35s -> 9557.11s]  Don't luigi me. I'm still learning do not luigi me, please. I'm not gonna hear that right now
[9558.12s -> 9568.00s]  But hold on will you get out of here?
[9568.80s -> 9570.80s]  Seriously get out of here
[9570.88s -> 9578.72s]  We just gotta move. Oh my god, just go
[9579.68s -> 9587.48s]  Where's the okay, where's the water water? I just gotta go straight wrap around I need food
[9588.36s -> 9594.44s]  just go
[9594.44s -> 9596.76s]  Pick the worst possible way to go man
[9634.92s -> 9639.24s]  No, I don't think I can do it. I don't think I can do it
[9641.12s -> 9651.00s]  I'm not I don't think i'm gonna make it. I don't think I have enough stamina to make it the whole way
[9652.31s -> 9659.03s]  Maybe I do
[9659.03s -> 9662.80s]  Uh
[9667.92s -> 9679.16s]  Yes, okay I got it we're good everything's fine already relaxed now we need to eat
[9683.60s -> 9687.44s]  They were still nowhere near the mysterious tree that we're supposed to find
[9688.42s -> 9690.66s]  But the voice and their memories encouraged them
[9691.32s -> 9696.52s]  It was wise and matters of root and rock and it could sense the soil under their feet
[9696.98s -> 9699.64s]  Changing oh no step by step
[9700.52s -> 9703.34s]  They were getting closer the thing looks dangerous
[9705.99s -> 9707.99s]  You got food reserves, don't you?
[9709.46s -> 9711.60s]  You ate it
[9711.60s -> 9715.20s]  You ate it. Why did you eat it? We weren't I didn't want you to eat that
[9715.84s -> 9740.39s]  I mean, I it was a good thing, but that's for emergencies. Don't eat that. Okay, let's keep going couple points of interest over here
[9741.65s -> 9749.09s]  But wait
[9749.09s -> 9751.41s]  Oh
[9751.41s -> 9771.36s]  No, do that again. It doesn't work. All right. I think he's he does it eventually we just have to get back and
[9772.82s -> 9781.72s]  Once he's not okay, the snow gets out for a certain reason. I don't know why
[9782.28s -> 9799.33s]  So should we give the uh attractive power up to gunu or keep the glow keep it low
[9799.49s -> 9846.24s]  I wonder how it works cool. I kind of miss the uh, the lighting it gives though. All right, so
[9848.36s -> 9858.92s]  Over here. I wonder why you would need to be
[9859.72s -> 9875.09s]  Uh attractive right? I wonder if there's something that ends up happening later or something. I don't know what it would be point of interest
[9876.55s -> 9897.60s]  Oh who's in here? I need I need somebody that can fight who's in here
[9898.48s -> 9912.20s]  Go vu you need a mushroom and you need four mushrooms and three crystals. What's up?
[9914.34s -> 9923.46s]  Go vu we got go vu. Ooh, I like go vu orange
[9929.20s -> 9939.60s]  It's a bunch of weirdos. All right, we gotta go
[9945.20s -> 9948.00s]  Uh back to that point of interest. Okay, it's like a temple
[9955.35s -> 9958.21s]  Get in get
[9958.21s -> 9960.21s]  Uh
[9962.58s -> 9965.06s]  No, so he died what who died
[9965.78s -> 9968.90s]  Who died somebody got spit on and died. Who was it?
[9969.52s -> 9970.66s]  guru
[9970.66s -> 9972.79s]  Where's guru?
[9972.79s -> 9974.47s]  Which one was guru?
[9974.47s -> 9980.85s]  Can we just no do not the one we just got?
[9983.12s -> 9991.65s]  Oh, okay. You're fine. It was guru guru is gone. I don't even remember who the fuck that was if i'm honest
[9992.05s -> 9995.51s]  so
[9996.47s -> 10003.96s]  Who was guru?
[10003.96s -> 10011.11s]  All right. I need to make a decision here was guru the purple
[10015.76s -> 10019.59s]  Max hell hold on
[10019.59s -> 10022.23s]  He doesn't even care. No, I just don't remember
[10022.87s -> 10025.52s]  Okay, I remember
[10025.52s -> 10026.96s]  the guru
[10026.96s -> 10030.39s]  shining cube is vu right? You're the cube
[10031.91s -> 10035.91s]  glow, uh, I remember the glow one is wu wu with the webbed feet
[10036.71s -> 10037.99s]  the new one
[10037.99s -> 10040.77s]  go vu is the orange one and then
[10041.57s -> 10051.19s]  Gui is the one with the big head. I don't remember the other one. Sorry that they got um
[10052.71s -> 10055.51s]  Like obliterated. I don't even know what to say
[10064.79s -> 10068.05s]  All right. We definitely need uh leadership
[10068.05s -> 10084.42s]  So this is maximum number of trebum. I definitely want it. I think that lets us have seven. I wonder what else
[10093.01s -> 10095.28s]  Probably do it twice
[10095.28s -> 10098.64s]  Water storage. This is probably this is important and stamina
[10099.28s -> 10100.87s]  I do both
[10100.87s -> 10112.07s]  food storage
[10112.07s -> 10118.26s]  food storage and stamina or water supply and stamina or
[10119.28s -> 10125.57s]  Stamina and another party member. Is this game multiplayer? I don't think so
[10126.21s -> 10128.61s]  I think it's just like a little single player campaign
[10136.74s -> 10139.72s]  Food and stamina stamina and leadership again
[10141.20s -> 10146.00s]  Um, well, I know i'm doing stamina. So where is it? It's over here somewhere, right? What about health?
[10147.73s -> 10158.15s]  I mean that one of our best friends got just annihilated in a second. That's expensive
[10159.17s -> 10165.67s]  Stamina do I even have enough to do anything? I could do stamina health. I have 7.5. So
[10166.39s -> 10169.84s]  Food capacity is probably water and food capacity is important. I think
[10172.92s -> 10188.50s]  Or I could just do another one food is important food's important
[10192.20s -> 10201.78s]  So I got food stamina
[10201.78s -> 10213.20s]  And that's it. You can yeah, I I can you can revive it probably costs money though
[10213.44s -> 10218.72s]  I don't know if i'm gonna do that yet. I'm afraid i'm gonna open this door and there's gonna be the things are gonna be here
[10232.55s -> 10238.56s]  Yep out out out
[10245.65s -> 10248.31s]  Mmm
[10248.31s -> 10250.48s]  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Are we safe?
[10251.67s -> 10259.56s]  One two, three, four five. It just hit me. I'm gonna cry. We lost we lost
[10260.26s -> 10270.34s]  Guogui it's hitting me right now. I'm actually sad. It just hit me right now. So awful
[10272.80s -> 10274.80s]  That's not his name
[10279.16s -> 10281.80s]  That is the equivalent of like if your son's name was like
[10282.44s -> 10289.14s]  David and it's like, oh no you something. No, we lost. What? Wait, wait, where's uh
[10290.36s -> 10292.36s]  Dread
[10294.93s -> 10297.33s]  Like you don't have your own fucking kid's name
[10298.90s -> 10300.66s]  Hey, honey. Do you have any idea where
[10302.50s -> 10311.62s]  Is
[10311.62s -> 10321.28s]  A new friend you want three mushrooms and three crystals. I don't have enough. There's an egg thing here though
[10329.51s -> 10337.52s]  Why are you so poor? I just spent like a million bucks upgrading everybody. There's an egg incubation thing here though
[10337.52s -> 10361.99s]  I need to find the egg. Where's the egg? I don't even there's a cave here. There's a cave here
[10362.23s -> 10363.91s]  All right. I'm gonna go to the cave
[10363.91s -> 10365.60s]  and see
[10365.60s -> 10369.12s]  We're just gonna go straight
[10373.06s -> 10395.52s]  Okay. Yeah, then right food
[10395.76s -> 10400.68s]  Uh, i'll pick up food in a second. There's a there's a cave here though. It's like right here somewhere
[10403.62s -> 10419.36s]  Where is it? Right here? Right here? Where is it? Oh, there it is. All right, let's go in
[10423.43s -> 10424.85s]  Ooh
[10424.85s -> 10459.92s]  Get that can I pick that up? Oh, i'm hungry. I don't have food. Somebody that has food everybody's any food
[10460.08s -> 10468.18s]  What the fuck are we doing?
[10468.18s -> 10492.87s]  Yeah, just wait get some food. Fuck off. No, fuck off. I can't wait to account
[10493.03s -> 10497.72s]  When can I throw like a grenade down that thing's throat? I'm serious
[10500.44s -> 10502.28s]  Okay back up
[10502.28s -> 10507.94s]  Get the agro
[10507.94s -> 10517.30s]  Good. All right head down there. I make anybody else shiny
[10518.02s -> 10529.46s]  Ooh, you know who should be shiny you you're gonna look cool shiny, right will it be orange and shiny give it to the cube
[10529.70s -> 10573.14s]  We need an attractive cube again. Yeah. Yep. Good call. All right, let's go in the hole. So what's down here friend and
[10574.93s -> 10576.87s]  five
[10576.87s -> 10604.90s]  Wugwu, I don't have five. Sorry buddy. Come back. Maybe help him, please
[10608.90s -> 10617.88s]  I don't think i'm gonna I spent too much money. We got the orange um orange guy. Unfortunately, I think that's where his
[10618.28s -> 10627.56s]  Uh final resting place is going to be i'm gonna go up here. There's also a potential egg
[10628.28s -> 10633.04s]  Somewhere hang out for a minute and see if we can find it
[10642.95s -> 10646.08s]  Making us cry. Well, there's nothing I can do about it
[10646.80s -> 10649.81s]  We chose. Um
[10649.89s -> 10651.75s]  Wugwu
[10651.75s -> 10653.75s]  This is who we picked. We picked a Wugwu
[10657.20s -> 10658.64s]  Wugwu is pretty cool
[10658.64s -> 10698.21s]  Wugwu already has jump. What about over here? Egg for an egg. Whoa, I forgot what that thing was. That was my bad
[10698.69s -> 10718.32s]  All right, I think we just got I think we just have to go does anybody have toxic, uh defense we could go down
[10718.64s -> 10730.05s]  all right, we everybody get toxic defense, uh, everybody has it right does the
[10730.85s -> 10733.57s]  Cube have it. Yes. All right. Let's go down. Are we something down there?
[10738.95s -> 10745.83s]  Right on the edge here though. I'm not gonna activate it. Am I?
[10746.39s -> 10760.08s]  Hope not. It's down here. Nothing. No, right
[10760.80s -> 10762.80s]  Gotta be something here
[10768.93s -> 10792.77s]  What what there's really nothing down here junk i'm not missing something right
[10794.29s -> 10801.88s]  No, maybe it's a place to hide maybe from one of those monsters
[10805.99s -> 10810.98s]  All right. I gotta pick the way that I want to run here. I think it's gonna be
[10813.14s -> 10817.06s]  All right. So i'm gonna come across this brush over here on the left. I'm just gonna go
[10818.16s -> 10825.49s]  Wham straight up here. It's an egg by the hole
[10829.32s -> 10845.65s]  Give it one more look if we got that. Let's see one egg by hole egg by hole
[10846.53s -> 10848.74s]  Let's see it
[10848.74s -> 10852.39s]  Where?
[10852.39s -> 10854.39s]  We need water. Yeah, i'll get water
[10861.64s -> 10862.60s]  Oh
[10862.60s -> 10869.17s]  We get out
[10872.50s -> 10879.97s]  You almost got sprayed
[10879.97s -> 10881.97s]  Oh my god, he's so fast
[10882.37s -> 10892.15s]  We gotta move. We gotta move. We gotta move. This thing is just we gotta move
[10892.71s -> 10907.32s]  I'm moving who has fins which one of you has gills you do all right as long as one of you has
[10907.88s -> 10911.40s]  gills or whatever the hell it is
[10911.40s -> 10915.59s]  That works for me. The swimmer is dead
[10918.66s -> 10922.58s]  Wait, the swimmer is the one that died. All right. Well, i'll give it to um
[10923.30s -> 10924.34s]  to
[10924.34s -> 10929.86s]  Get out of here for it. Oh, oh no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no everybody dies here
[10930.58s -> 10936.53s]  Everybody dies here
[10936.69s -> 10942.13s]  No, don't poison them all please everybody get out, please everybody get out get out get out get out get out get out
[10945.12s -> 10947.92s]  We good. Oh, thank god. I'm so happy
[10951.01s -> 10953.01s]  He's so tired. Okay
[10953.17s -> 10964.21s]  We're safe
[10964.21s -> 10966.79s]  very nice
[10966.79s -> 10976.05s]  Uh, do we need any bigger people? I don't think so. All right, i'm eating up and we're getting out of here
[10977.48s -> 10984.93s]  Oh, I thought you guys said I killed the swimmer. You have another swimmer. Oh, I thought that woodway died and woodway was the swimmer
[10986.79s -> 10994.55s]  Well, okay. All right. I gotta move. This is a horrible route. I need to go
[10995.19s -> 11004.31s]  This way and up or fuck it. Whatever. I'll make it work. I think it's okay
[11015.12s -> 11023.33s]  Come on move. Oh, we gotta go now
[11024.13s -> 11026.37s]  Don't get caught by that thing. I don't know what that thing's doing
[11029.00s -> 11031.00s]  This thing's trying to I think it's trying to suck somebody up
[11031.56s -> 11045.92s]  We're all here. Okay, gotta get to here
[11049.78s -> 11058.42s]  Go, this is a risky move very risky
[11059.04s -> 11062.77s]  Incredibly risky, but I think it's gonna work out
[11065.92s -> 11072.13s]  Shaving some time
[11074.13s -> 11076.13s]  Okay, i'm gonna calm down I gotta calm down
[11076.69s -> 11079.01s]  Come on, you're good. Everything's fine
[11080.05s -> 11082.85s]  Oh my god, it's right there
[11085.27s -> 11087.27s]  I made a mistake
[11093.78s -> 11098.92s]  Shit it moves so fast. It moves really fast
[11100.10s -> 11112.92s]  Okay, autosave is right there. We're okay. Good thing you got the crystals. I know it was stupid
[11113.48s -> 11122.71s]  But there's so many crystals in there. All right, let's go
[11123.59s -> 11160.02s]  Who's the fastest probably this game has me so invested. Yeah, kind of
[11160.58s -> 11164.37s]  It's just I don't know. It's cool. All right. I'm thinking straight ahead
[11165.17s -> 11174.87s]  From here just go get out of the way go straight
[11175.59s -> 11177.43s]  And then I gotta go right
[11177.43s -> 11207.46s]  When it drops I gotta go right left. What is that thing? Is that a bad thing?
[11208.10s -> 11209.46s]  Wait, what is that?
[11209.46s -> 11219.20s]  What what is that?
[11219.20s -> 11221.84s]  Oh, it's one of those flying things. I got you
[11225.22s -> 11235.40s]  Come on go and then it's over here
[11236.84s -> 11248.36s]  Right ahead blue smoke will refill your stamina. That's unbelievable to know. Thank you
[11256.10s -> 11261.16s]  Okay, we're safe. Very nice
[11261.99s -> 11263.35s]  Oh pretty
[11263.35s -> 11281.59s]  Does anybody still have a horn? Can you please explain this game? I am very confused. This game is called the internal cylinder
[11283.36s -> 11289.40s]  Game gives you an area to work with you find little creatures that you have join your party
[11289.40s -> 11298.39s]  there's a bunch of upgrades the internal cylinder the the eternal cylinder and
[11299.03s -> 11302.88s]  once you leave the fortnight circle the game
[11303.68s -> 11312.55s]  Crushes and destroys everything that was before and you can only move forward pretty cool
[11312.79s -> 11319.03s]  I got my little party here seem to be doing pretty seem to be doing. Okay, one of them died
[11319.91s -> 11321.99s]  Uh got obliterated by poison
[11327.09s -> 11329.73s]  What was this monstrous creature?
[11331.32s -> 11336.12s]  Was this one of the cylinder servants? He's the ones the elder had warned them of
[11337.67s -> 11339.27s]  It's very form
[11339.27s -> 11341.89s]  terrified the trevor
[11341.89s -> 11347.46s]  Even the voice on their memories seemed frightened of it. And then somehow
[11348.32s -> 11350.40s]  The trebum remembered the creature's name
[11351.42s -> 11352.64s]  Mathematician
[11352.64s -> 11354.82s]  The mathematician
[11359.86s -> 11363.76s]  Well, I say we don't go over there
[11370.45s -> 11372.45s]  We need water how we don't know
[11372.53s -> 11380.39s]  We need to eat very badly
[11380.87s -> 11386.37s]  What else has food give it to guna?
[11393.22s -> 11401.60s]  Okay, just get rid of these things
[11403.56s -> 11405.96s]  Dad get rid of those. There's no reason for you to keep carrying these
[11406.76s -> 11409.57s]  I'm gonna be pissed if I need these for some reason
[11412.87s -> 11415.11s]  You can't become double q but just food, right?
[11417.03s -> 11419.01s]  Yeah
[11419.01s -> 11430.07s]  Now we don't need these. Um, oh my god
[11432.80s -> 11434.80s]  crawling back over the cylinder
[11436.26s -> 11440.26s]  The mathematician is horrifying as quickly as he had appeared back to
[11441.67s -> 11443.64s]  To what?
[11443.64s -> 11447.86s]  What lay behind the cylinder? We need to know
[11448.66s -> 11450.66s]  I'm very i'm completely invested
[11451.46s -> 11463.76s]  All right, what's on the map?
[11463.84s -> 11468.42s]  Nothing, no points of interest anymore. I'm gonna explore over here a little
[11470.80s -> 11474.68s]  there is
[11474.68s -> 11476.60s]  No temple
[11476.60s -> 11479.80s]  That's really pretty this game's beautiful
[11491.16s -> 11494.20s]  I wonder what those things do they're kind of scaring me. So i'm not gonna go near them
[11504.39s -> 11506.39s]  Something over there now wheels
[11510.20s -> 11518.92s]  I think the guy is rolling the cylinder like a joint to smoke with germa with the people happy
[11528.07s -> 11529.27s]  so
[11529.27s -> 11531.27s]  I don't even know
[11532.42s -> 11536.42s]  I love that people happy face. I love people people is just so funny
[11539.57s -> 11541.64s]  egg
[11541.64s -> 11546.85s]  egg acquired
[11546.85s -> 11549.97s]  Somebody's dying here and I don't know who but someone's gonna die
[11554.60s -> 11561.35s]  Right. This looks very difficult. Whatever that wants me to do
[11562.71s -> 11565.52s]  I need an incubator
[11565.52s -> 11570.84s]  Get that shit out of here incubator
[11571.72s -> 11579.54s]  incubator
[11579.54s -> 11580.92s]  incubator
[11580.92s -> 11605.43s]  one of those cars
[11613.20s -> 11634.80s]  This shit down there, but I don't want anyone to get just rushed so it's safe right there
[11635.20s -> 11640.50s]  I would not don't jump down. Don't jump down. That's a very bad idea
[11641.86s -> 11650.72s]  Don't jump down. You're gonna get yourself crushed. Oh, please come back this way. Don't be silly
[11651.04s -> 11667.03s]  Um, I don't see an incubator
[11667.27s -> 11679.43s]  I don't want to go too far
[11679.43s -> 11681.84s]  Is there one over there?
[11681.84s -> 11683.76s]  This piece of shit's gonna
[11683.76s -> 11702.24s]  Drain all of our powers. I'm just taking it with us everyone. Be careful
[11702.72s -> 11712.55s]  I'm gonna be very careful
[11712.55s -> 11716.07s]  I'm kind of i'm at the edge of the map here. I gotta go okay left
[11716.47s -> 11737.24s]  I gotta go that way behind you don't say that. I think there's new shit down there. What is that? I need to see
[11737.88s -> 11745.22s]  What was this strange groove in the ground? It seemed artificial like something made to contain water
[11745.94s -> 11749.14s]  But all it contained were these large rolling machines
[11750.23s -> 11752.63s]  Who had built these things and why?
[11753.59s -> 11756.55s]  They were not servants of the cylinder that much was clear
[11770.32s -> 11795.48s]  Um, we have to do this. No, I can't sprint with the egg perfect placement. Don't tell me that wasn't perfect placement
[11799.54s -> 11807.17s]  We made it we made it slow slow down slow down if we can get out this way
[11807.65s -> 11824.00s]  Can I just get up that? Oh, come on. I have the super jump
[11826.82s -> 11827.70s]  Yes
[11827.70s -> 11838.16s]  We all here. Where's where?
[11838.24s -> 11847.64s]  Where where's where where's where oh, no everybody's here this five
[11848.69s -> 11863.92s]  Wait, i'm losing track of my children. Where no, we're all here. Okay, we're here incubator over there and there is a
[11864.32s -> 11891.35s]  Um, I think it's a baby in one of those should get two here. Aha, and then there's somebody in there
[11896.68s -> 11902.79s]  Wave warm. All right wave warm. Welcome to the family and
[11903.33s -> 11904.39s]  Vopo
[11904.39s -> 11913.70s]  Wants three turnips and three crystals. Okay. Well we get I already gave the crystals
[11913.70s -> 11925.14s]  So we need the turnips. They're all over here. Here you go. Who ate one. There were two here
[11925.22s -> 11927.22s]  Who ate the other one? Why did you eat it?
[11928.55s -> 11933.92s]  Why did you eat the turnip one of you ate one? Wait, did you eat it or you have it in your inventory?
[11934.40s -> 11956.63s]  Who who has it they ate it? I need another I need another turnip. There's gotta be one more here somewhere, right?
[11957.19s -> 11964.52s]  Bro, you had to eat the one other turnip that we needed
[11964.92s -> 11977.83s]  You couldn't have eaten anything else a flower a mushroom. You had to eat the turnip. Where is it?
[11978.07s -> 11991.19s]  How can I tell how this is where this is working?
[11997.12s -> 12002.58s]  Will it hang or beep or is it on a map?
[12002.82s -> 12014.18s]  Try it on. Yeah, i'll try it on like this plant and see what it does. It's a regular one
[12017.27s -> 12022.29s]  Yeah, like this. Those are like everywhere. Okay, so
[12023.09s -> 12027.97s]  That's what it does. This is not you tell me there's not one even in remotely in this vicinity
[12028.53s -> 12037.16s]  God damn it. Yes
[12037.40s -> 12051.67s]  Well, I need to remember the way this is in the maps right here your children inherited your lack of self-control
[12052.61s -> 12060.96s]  We needed i'm not going anywhere. That was three full crystals. I'm not wasting that
[12061.60s -> 12071.40s]  I'm not leaving till we find another turnip. There better be another one on this world
[12084.71s -> 12104.20s]  There's no turnips in this whole land anymore. Not anywhere. Shit. Well, let's get water
[12115.43s -> 12119.11s]  Dude, your kids have the hiccups. They're suffering. They're okay
[12125.03s -> 12127.67s]  One turnip better not be the death of this
[12128.55s -> 12132.21s]  Thing here hasn't even picked up anything
[12145.36s -> 12150.53s]  Just reload the save. I don't know how far back out how far back would that be?
[12151.91s -> 12156.71s]  19 seconds ago or 14 minutes ago. I don't know 15 minutes
[12159.27s -> 12161.27s]  That seems kind of far
[12161.35s -> 12178.04s]  I don't know what that means, but it's I don't like it
[12185.16s -> 12187.16s]  I need one turnip
[12188.29s -> 12200.00s]  Just one just need one
[12213.54s -> 12216.42s]  They respawn. I think they'd be coming up on the radar if they did right?
[12226.21s -> 12227.81s]  I think
[12227.81s -> 12236.96s]  There are no turnips. I looked everywhere
[12243.11s -> 12248.26s]  No
[12248.26s -> 12253.67s]  Check back. Yeah, let's go back to where it was that was
[12254.87s -> 12272.00s]  Over here. I do need to eat though. Hold on honey. Whatever. These things are coral reef doesn't help me
[12272.32s -> 12288.45s]  I thought you were a plant. Okay, let's make our way back
[12299.86s -> 12308.21s]  That's an interesting thing going on over there in the distance. I don't know if that is all right. It's over here
[12311.04s -> 12316.16s]  There ain't any there's no fucking turnips. They they wait. Wait a minute. These are the trees. These are the trees
[12316.32s -> 12320.77s]  I need to eat these these are the flying trees. I'm very excited right now
[12323.06s -> 12328.58s]  Finally the weeping oh shit the elder had told them to find were within the trebum's grasp
[12328.82s -> 12335.38s]  But though the trebum were happy they realized that they faced a new challenge
[12336.92s -> 12342.28s]  The ripe fruit were floating out of reach and the others were enclosed in a hard shell
[12342.92s -> 12360.88s]  They would have to find a way to crack them open. Uh like that, right? This is
[12363.41s -> 12365.41s]  Somebody we need to experiment on somebody
[12368.88s -> 12402.58s]  You the one that looks like a goldfish you do it good luck godspeed his power is stupid
[12404.26s -> 12411.14s]  Okay, so they can float should everybody have this I wonder because this is probably body, right?
[12411.46s -> 12417.60s]  What does this count as something else?
[12421.56s -> 12431.27s]  I wonder will they all just fly i'm gonna yeah, i'll take a few because I want to make sure I have a few
[12431.91s -> 12437.60s]  just for later
[12437.60s -> 12443.27s]  Test it on the cube. That's a good call. All right, what happens if you eat this?
[12451.28s -> 12465.70s]  Why did that not break? Okay, so it is it does count as
[12466.34s -> 12480.77s]  Body who doesn't have one body thing disco ball. I think it's okay as long as one of them has it, right?
[12481.25s -> 12494.52s]  I think that that's fine. It's yeah. It's a it's an attractive balloon now. Yeah, we're good. Okay, can't roll anymore. Yeah again
[12495.54s -> 12504.88s]  Uh, all right turnips turnips very important. I need one
[12509.09s -> 12511.09s]  Maybe water the turnip plant. I'll try it
[12511.49s -> 12543.59s]  I want to investigate this to whatever this is. I wonder if I can get up up. That's nothing up there
[12560.12s -> 12582.18s]  Are they in danger? I'm get out of the way. You know, why don't you take a horn?
[12583.04s -> 12597.46s]  Yeah, um give it to you. We won't maybe that it can scare him away. Okay, let's try this
[12600.05s -> 12624.74s]  Let's work get out of here. Get out of here. Keep going further
[12625.46s -> 12659.65s]  Don't don't eat somebody everybody. Follow me up here. Follow me up here. Is everybody all right? What's in there is some magical shit up here
[12659.89s -> 12679.03s]  What is that? There's magical shit up here. Um, we should eat this you
[12680.15s -> 12686.72s]  Get it. Can I eat it? Can I give it to the disco ball? Give it to gweg. Whom?
[12686.80s -> 12704.29s]  I don't know how that is. Should I give it to whewom? Give it to wugwol. Uh, wugwol is not up here
[12704.45s -> 12726.76s]  Where okay? Where is everybody? I got what I needed from here. What the second player here anything here, holy shit
[12727.00s -> 12733.49s]  Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wugwol no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[12733.49s -> 12735.49s]  No, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[12738.80s -> 12744.32s]  All right, I'm freaking out for no reason. We're safe. We're all here, right? Thank God
[12747.68s -> 12749.33s]  I actually
[12749.33s -> 12758.21s]  That was as if one of my children was actually in danger. Uh, i'm gonna give it to
[12764.07s -> 12766.87s]  As wet wet wet wombs not even here
[12768.20s -> 12776.87s]  I'm gonna give it a wee wham. I think wee wham should have it. Okay, who's got it on them?
[12781.88s -> 12797.72s]  Wee wham. Yeah. All right. We won't try it meteor feet
[12802.04s -> 12815.83s]  I can do a ground pound those legs should have given it to gunu. I didn't know what it was though
[12819.68s -> 12825.49s]  I wonder if I can stomp on this thing now. This is a really bad testing of hypothesis here
[12827.25s -> 12852.39s]  But I mean thought I had the horn, but I don't have who is the horn. We're good. Okay. Is there any turnips over here?
[12852.79s -> 12858.34s]  What do you need?
[12858.34s -> 12864.60s]  God damn it. No fucking turnips or anything either
[12880.58s -> 12889.80s]  Oh, I can change that's what was going on. Okay. Well got some new abilities found the tree
[12891.54s -> 12898.53s]  Now let's go back to the turn turnip is down here and then i'm imagining I probably have to float over
[12899.01s -> 12905.43s]  Let me just see if the turnips respond is that a chest
[12906.58s -> 12909.19s]  Where is that?
[12909.19s -> 12911.96s]  What do you mean?
[12911.96s -> 12916.53s]  the chest
[12916.53s -> 12926.71s]  Maybe just an inactive roller
[12928.53s -> 12945.36s]  That's cool. All right. There's the ball with the turnip. Don't think I can get it
[12947.88s -> 12954.28s]  Uh try anything on the pillar. Yeah, that's what is that? That's the what power is this?
[12961.00s -> 12963.00s]  Don't stomp your friends, please
[12963.48s -> 12967.38s]  That's the third idea good to have
[12967.62s -> 12971.96s]  I'm just storing it. Maybe somebody else just have it
[12972.60s -> 12974.60s]  Uh, i'm gonna give it to the stop
[12974.84s -> 12986.16s]  Look i'm turnips. We got a raid. Oh, we did have a raid
[12987.55s -> 12996.66s]  Automated what's up auto? Thanks for the raid auto be having a good night
[13002.07s -> 13004.07s]  Out of water. Yeah, i'm heading over there now
[13009.28s -> 13020.60s]  Turnip there were three turnips here one two
[13021.48s -> 13028.63s]  Three and you ate one of them you did you ate one and now we cannot save our
[13029.19s -> 13034.16s]  Friend and we have to abandon the friend now. We wasted three crystals
[13034.24s -> 13036.24s]  I'm glad you ate it
[13036.32s -> 13038.32s]  I'm glad it was delicious
[13038.40s -> 13052.74s]  But you wasted three crystals. That's a huge amount of currency. This one looks a little more green to you
[13062.77s -> 13064.77s]  Can I take I can't take the crystal back?
[13066.79s -> 13068.79s]  Water for more than half a second
[13068.87s -> 13072.26s]  I mean, we're all just sitting here watering it
[13079.43s -> 13082.56s]  No, it's not gonna work
[13082.56s -> 13084.56s]  That's sad. Um unfortunate
[13087.87s -> 13091.97s]  unfortunate
[13091.97s -> 13093.17s]  I got my
[13093.17s -> 13095.01s]  thing that finds
[13095.01s -> 13097.01s]  Ernie it's uh, I think that's it
[13097.41s -> 13100.10s]  I think we lost three crystals
[13108.87s -> 13112.76s]  All right
[13112.76s -> 13115.27s]  shit
[13115.27s -> 13116.79s]  That's so sad
[13116.79s -> 13118.13s]  Okay
[13118.13s -> 13123.49s]  Well, we're leaving
[13123.49s -> 13125.49s]  Save him. I can't
[13126.20s -> 13134.34s]  Unless I reload a save from like 40 minutes ago. It's all right. I'll get the crystals back
[13139.65s -> 13141.65s]  So the play here
[13142.45s -> 13144.61s]  Is that to float over this to get to here?
[13145.17s -> 13149.40s]  Where's the cylinder?
[13149.40s -> 13151.40s]  Uh cylinder is all the way back there
[13152.20s -> 13154.84s]  I should be in a fine spot float over
[13155.48s -> 13170.87s]  Let's see. So if I go I wonder oh, no, no, there's a closer one. Here it is
[13171.43s -> 13177.75s]  I'll take a few more of these i'm just gonna keep them. I'll store them on somebody
[13178.55s -> 13181.52s]  Who knows in the hell i'm gonna get access to this again
[13182.40s -> 13200.52s]  Save yeah, I think it just saved right now. It is saving. Okay
[13202.32s -> 13204.48s]  Uh, where's my float friend? There you are
[13205.36s -> 13207.33s]  Okay, here we go
[13207.33s -> 13225.62s]  What's that even with the ability to float?
[13226.42s -> 13232.98s]  Overcoming the cylinder would have to be done very carefully what they needed was a geyser that was well positioned
[13233.38s -> 13236.10s]  Close to the cylinder when it lays still
[13236.74s -> 13238.74s]  Or their plan would never work
[13239.38s -> 13241.38s]  They would have to keep looking
[13241.62s -> 13248.12s]  And meanwhile they would try not to think about what sort of monster could kill one of the flying serpents
[13262.79s -> 13264.23s]  Oh, okay
[13269.48s -> 13276.44s]  Okay in order to float above the eternal cylinder you must find a geyser that is close to the cylinder when it lies dormant
[13277.25s -> 13282.21s]  The eternal cylinder will never allow the trepum to jump over it while it is advancing
[13282.45s -> 13296.50s]  I mean, I guess I gotta I gotta just kind of I gotta go
[13318.44s -> 13333.17s]  Everyone's making it. We're good. Okay. Here comes the border border here. All right float. Holy shit
[13334.23s -> 13336.00s]  uh
[13336.00s -> 13341.73s]  Really bad timing really bad timing go
[13349.12s -> 13364.61s]  We're good, bro
[13365.01s -> 13367.20s]  Why?
[13367.20s -> 13368.96s]  No
[13368.96s -> 13370.84s]  No
[13370.84s -> 13372.32s]  No
[13372.32s -> 13373.44s]  Um
[13373.44s -> 13377.03s]  No, um
[13377.03s -> 13394.55s]  No, the whole family made it barely
[13400.92s -> 13431.86s]  Old you just you just ate the why'd you do that? That was mean you got you're on kind of a mean streak right now
[13432.10s -> 13462.34s]  Okay, is there a geyser here? I would imagine not probably later. What the fuck is that? That's terrifying. It's sniffing. Okay
[13469.04s -> 13471.04s]  Okay, it's out of here
[13471.12s -> 13474.32s]  Please come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Just I don't know what to I don't know where to go
[13474.72s -> 13481.43s]  I don't know where to go
[13481.43s -> 13482.31s]  um
[13482.31s -> 13486.34s]  We need coats we need coats
[13493.40s -> 13499.91s]  Look at the chat. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What the geyser geyser geyser it was where I was being I see it right there
[13499.91s -> 13552.44s]  I was getting chased by this weird bird elephant thing our home
[13553.56s -> 13560.53s]  Our world. Oh, that's ominous
[13563.81s -> 13566.85s]  Drop down. What if I just run across?
[13567.41s -> 13572.87s]  Cover their eyes
[13572.87s -> 13597.97s]  I don't know if this is a good idea the other side
[13598.85s -> 13616.29s]  this thing
[13616.29s -> 13617.57s]  That's new
[13617.57s -> 13619.57s]  Is it new? No, it's
[13619.57s -> 13625.99s]  not oh
[13625.99s -> 13627.11s]  my
[13627.11s -> 13631.27s]  God
[13631.27s -> 13633.99s]  We'll get back up when we go back up, please
[13635.46s -> 13638.58s]  We just we're just gonna get out of here. We're just gonna get out of here here
[13647.20s -> 13648.64s]  What just happened?
[13648.64s -> 13666.05s]  We all here holy shit in the dream inside the strange giant's mind
[13666.69s -> 13669.17s]  The voice that spoke to the trebum seemed different
[13670.24s -> 13673.28s]  It was less like a memory more like something
[13674.32s -> 13675.52s]  alive
[13675.52s -> 13685.94s]  But there were so many other voices too. The gang goes up against the god. This is very bright
[13696.20s -> 13699.56s]  What the fuck that just made me sick
[13701.38s -> 13703.86s]  I remember the faces. Wait, where do I go?
[13704.66s -> 13709.33s]  Oh, no
[13724.76s -> 13727.01s]  We lost a couple people
[13727.01s -> 13731.49s]  I don't I think I think they're fine though. There was something hidden in this place
[13732.39s -> 13734.71s]  And the voice wanted the trebum to find it
[13735.33s -> 13737.33s]  dmt breakthrough
[13738.13s -> 13743.73s]  I took dmt. I remember a city built. I was a little fucking weird frog person
[13745.71s -> 13749.79s]  When I was fucked up, I was eating things that gave me different powers
[13751.81s -> 13757.01s]  Running for this giant cylinder. This really does feel like an acid trip somebody explaining to you their acid trip
[13763.07s -> 13772.61s]  beauty each voice
[13772.69s -> 13777.57s]  Was a memory a song from a forgotten time slowly fading
[13778.72s -> 13780.72s]  Hold on. I don't want to make any
[13782.24s -> 13788.75s]  Memories of things that trebum had once been capable of perhaps the voice suggested
[13789.63s -> 13791.63s]  These could be reclaimed
[13792.74s -> 13796.98s]  I remember our towers stretched out to the sky
[13798.02s -> 13800.02s]  Yearning for the stars
[13800.99s -> 13805.47s]  They were symbols of our best. I am tripping right now. I'm
[13806.91s -> 13808.91s]  It's kind of late
[13810.35s -> 13812.35s]  As we fought for change
[13813.22s -> 13815.22s]  For a world that was
[13815.78s -> 13817.87s]  different
[13817.87s -> 13819.55s]  Then it came
[13819.55s -> 13821.55s]  And the towers fell
[13821.55s -> 13823.79s]  Somebody said cool math games
[13824.91s -> 13829.26s]  Where our voices now songs
[13830.56s -> 13833.44s]  I only hear one and it is
[13835.23s -> 13837.97s]  eternal
[13837.97s -> 13839.89s]  So, what are we are we?
[13839.89s -> 13841.41s]  I'm very curious
[13841.41s -> 13849.63s]  I guess we're just walking has the memories returned to the trebum old abilities
[13850.51s -> 13853.55s]  Stolen by the cylinder were finally restored
[13854.96s -> 13856.96s]  But there was so much more
[13857.68s -> 13859.68s]  The voice had answers
[13860.00s -> 13861.04s]  but
[13861.04s -> 13863.04s]  It was
[13863.60s -> 13869.90s]  Frightening as it was the trebum would have to come back sacrifice gunu
[13870.54s -> 13874.38s]  I'm getting contact high from this game
[13878.37s -> 13895.81s]  Loud okay, wait, he's rolling this place of death and nothingness
[13896.45s -> 13898.63s]  There were no answers to be found here
[13899.49s -> 13903.81s]  The voice and their memories urge them to return to the lands of the living
[13904.82s -> 13908.98s]  He's the one rolling it. It's not just like a sentient thing. It's he's
[13910.10s -> 13912.26s]  Is he's wrote wait, there's like stuff here
[13914.10s -> 13915.14s]  Yeah
[13915.14s -> 13916.26s]  Crunchies
[13916.26s -> 13925.70s]  What this thing was a we saw this before this weird skeleton
[13928.98s -> 13943.44s]  That's not a time to celebrate by the way, just saying that's interesting. So I
[13944.32s -> 13947.27s]  This is freaky. Okay
[13949.40s -> 13952.68s]  This is the movie trailer for the gritty reboot of cuber
[13953.40s -> 13958.84s]  well, I guess we're going back but
[13959.32s -> 13964.90s]  Like that
[13964.90s -> 13968.20s]  Yeah this time this time he's uncensored
[13968.82s -> 13988.52s]  I don't look so good
[13988.84s -> 13996.90s]  Thank you
[13996.90s -> 14001.68s]  What is that thing?
[14002.00s -> 14004.24s]  Um
[14004.24s -> 14006.24s]  Oh, no, how do I save him?
[14007.22s -> 14008.82s]  No, govu
[14008.82s -> 14010.58s]  Govu's dead
[14010.58s -> 14012.90s]  Was dead. He's the one that can float
[14013.78s -> 14015.30s]  Excuse me
[14015.30s -> 14018.95s]  Come on. Come on. We gotta go. We gotta go
[14020.53s -> 14022.37s]  Wait float, please
[14022.37s -> 14025.57s]  A profound feeling of futility overcame the trebuch
[14026.85s -> 14028.69s]  Govu's dead
[14028.69s -> 14033.25s]  What the fuck is all this shit? I'm sorry, but this was not over here
[14035.36s -> 14037.04s]  to make matters worse
[14037.04s -> 14039.60s]  Ahead of them lay the cold and snowy lands
[14039.76s -> 14041.76s]  The tundra
[14041.76s -> 14047.12s]  What a very nice place for trebum who are not meant to get out of the way get out of the way we need the okay
[14047.68s -> 14052.64s]  Okay, narrator. This is not a please. Stop talking to me that they could find help
[14054.02s -> 14056.18s]  We need to get warm right now
[14057.48s -> 14059.48s]  I can't believe
[14059.72s -> 14062.02s]  Okay, eat eat eat eat eat eat
[14062.02s -> 14066.66s]  Uh, we're good. If the trebum were going to deal with this terrible cold
[14067.57s -> 14070.37s]  They needed to find a mutation that would keep them warm
[14070.85s -> 14072.85s]  God damn their memories
[14073.41s -> 14076.77s]  That the answer lay in the odd little purple furball
[14077.57s -> 14083.81s]  That grew where the beautiful snow corals rose from the ground. That thing is coming back and I don't know how to deal with it
[14085.51s -> 14087.35s]  It's just taken
[14087.35s -> 14090.71s]  It's taken my govu's and whatever these things are
[14091.35s -> 14094.55s]  Where do I need to go from here? There is no map
[14095.86s -> 14096.74s]  um
[14096.74s -> 14098.74s]  Okay, i'm just going this way
[14099.32s -> 14116.45s]  Scare it with a horn come here fuck out of here get out of here
[14119.84s -> 14141.06s]  That's for govu
[14141.06s -> 14146.32s]  Do water? Yeah, take it. I this I have the stomp ability too with this
[14150.98s -> 14157.54s]  Oh, what is this? Uh, I don't want to lose the stomp. I don't want to who should I give this to?
[14158.58s -> 14169.20s]  This game is 13 hours long
[14171.14s -> 14173.54s]  That's pretty that's cool. I'm gonna give it to you
[14174.34s -> 14178.63s]  Because I feel like you got the webbed feet, but what else you got?
[14181.00s -> 14182.44s]  The yellow guy
[14182.44s -> 14184.44s]  Actually yellow guy doesn't have anything
[14187.03s -> 14188.15s]  very true
[14188.15s -> 14207.86s]  Ignites a small flame at the tip. I got a fire blow blower. Okay, do you don't get burnt to death, please?
[14208.58s -> 14217.51s]  What is that thing? I don't this thing's interesting. I don't know what it does, but I have it now
[14219.32s -> 14221.32s]  big like burning rock
[14221.48s -> 14225.51s]  Okay, i'm gonna throw this at somebody
[14225.67s -> 14231.92s]  What's that? Is it the same thing?
[14235.08s -> 14238.77s]  It's like a jewel
[14238.77s -> 14239.81s]  Ah
[14239.81s -> 14243.28s]  All right
[14243.28s -> 14256.72s]  Kind of like a lantern maybe oh my fucking god. I need to eat. You're right. I completely forgot it existed
[14270.05s -> 14282.32s]  Did I cook the food what happens if I cook the food do anything different I don't think so
[14288.28s -> 14290.28s]  Get the heat source back. Yeah, I will
[14290.52s -> 14295.52s]  Want to eat a bunch of food?
[14295.52s -> 14298.47s]  You need to avenge govu
[14298.47s -> 14302.40s]  I don't know if I can do that
[14302.40s -> 14304.95s]  Okay, we're good
[14304.95s -> 14307.03s]  Uh, i'm gonna get that heat source back
[14307.91s -> 14320.71s]  I'm just taking it with us
[14320.71s -> 14322.55s]  We'll light the bird on fire
[14322.55s -> 14333.49s]  This game is 69 hours long
[14334.05s -> 14342.45s]  Go roast that motherfucker. No, it's okay
[14346.69s -> 14348.69s]  I am gonna check down here though
[14371.46s -> 14373.06s]  Please do anything
[14373.06s -> 14383.30s]  No, are you afraid of the bird? I mean maybe a little
[14385.52s -> 14390.47s]  He instantly killed my one of my friends. Of course i'm gonna be a little apprehensive
[14403.81s -> 14407.19s]  All right. I don't want to leave yet. There's nothing really down here
[14407.67s -> 14417.27s]  All right, I got a question for you. We can do a poll. Do you want to see me complete this game?
[14417.99s -> 14422.39s]  Yes, or no if the answer is yes, this is what we will play
[14426.71s -> 14438.76s]  That's a lot of yeses. All right, we don't even do a poll. It's not necessary. I wonder what this thing is for though
[14439.60s -> 14448.44s]  All right, uh gunu you need to get food a lot of it gunu should be the one doing this
[14452.20s -> 14458.21s]  Give all the food to gunu
[14458.75s -> 14460.29s]  92% damn, okay
[14460.29s -> 14468.52s]  One of those motherfuckers over there. All right, that's plenty
[14473.49s -> 14475.49s]  Never gonna play sorcery ever again
[14476.40s -> 14480.39s]  Yes, I will I promise look at this little guy
[14486.18s -> 14488.18s]  Um, that's all right. What's this?
[14488.74s -> 14497.00s]  Who should eat who's gonna eat this?
[14497.00s -> 14498.04s]  uh
[14498.04s -> 14506.92s]  Wugwool you think so?
[14508.82s -> 14511.38s]  All right. Wugwool you eat this thing
[14511.38s -> 14514.88s]  Probably a spiky head
[14514.88s -> 14517.92s]  What are you doing? They're just rubbing their butts. What were they doing? Okay
[14520.63s -> 14522.63s]  All right kind of mutate
[14530.13s -> 14535.89s]  Analytical eyes can tag creatures and add them to your compendium there. You can find important information about their behavior
[14536.77s -> 14538.77s]  With this new pair of eyes
[14541.01s -> 14541.89s]  Well
[14541.89s -> 14544.61s]  To be perfectly honest, they felt rather silly
[14545.56s -> 14547.32s]  but despite that
[14547.32s -> 14554.36s]  The voice and their minds told them with these eyes they could learn much about the creatures they encountered
[14554.68s -> 14556.68s]  Okay, the voice was glad about this
[14557.16s -> 14559.80s]  It was knowledgeable in the manner of animals
[14560.68s -> 14566.68s]  And now it could contribute its wisdom to their memories so I can tag monsters
[14567.48s -> 14569.48s]  Try to avoid them or something probably
[14570.50s -> 14572.55s]  What's the big shadow?
[14572.55s -> 14575.88s]  What's the big shadow? What's that?
[14576.52s -> 14581.19s]  This game is so scary
[14581.19s -> 14584.79s]  Okay
[14584.79s -> 14586.48s]  um
[14586.48s -> 14588.48s]  I still can't see but
[14589.08s -> 14590.76s]  I know it's up there
[14590.76s -> 14598.12s]  Plenty of food. I got the cold resist
[14602.34s -> 14604.34s]  I pat I wonder what I give it
[14604.42s -> 14606.42s]  What happened to that egg that I had?
[14607.56s -> 14614.29s]  That is completely scared of it. How are you just activated has a quest
[14616.53s -> 14617.81s]  It does
[14617.81s -> 14635.54s]  Look at that. It makes me hungry
[14636.26s -> 14638.18s]  I could I should probably eat too
[14638.18s -> 14642.66s]  I'm probably not gonna stream that much longer
[14642.66s -> 14643.62s]  um
[14643.62s -> 14647.80s]  You probably imagine some of these later night. Just hang out streams will be
[14648.85s -> 14650.53s]  not like
[14650.53s -> 14652.13s]  Eight hours long
[14652.13s -> 14661.59s]  Okay, hold on. I'll finish it though. I will
[14666.37s -> 14668.37s]  pink and green
[14669.78s -> 14683.70s]  Cool. I'll do this tower. Uh, this whatever this little um zone thing under here. Wait, where's my horn blower?
[14684.10s -> 14694.52s]  Where's my horn blower? Hey, fuck you
[14695.48s -> 14722.71s]  You see anything yell really doesn't like the horn at all. Oh
[14723.27s -> 14733.27s]  I think I think they're okay. They just got smashed in the face
[14733.83s -> 14737.48s]  Look, they hurt a little but it's okay
[14738.96s -> 14744.80s]  oh
[14744.80s -> 14761.78s]  Get that thing out here. I don't want that thing swooping down. Everybody. All right. Where's guna? What is right here? What's that?
[14762.18s -> 14776.72s]  Oh shit. Oh, it's just water. I think this is an upgrade place, but I don't have that much
[14777.12s -> 14783.22s]  Should I even go in here because it's gonna when I get out it's gonna um walk it behind me
[14783.54s -> 14796.88s]  Commit to it. Yeah, you should save it. I don't I feel like I kind of have to just get out of here
[14799.20s -> 14823.19s]  Yeah, it should give me a couple. I don't know if it's enough though activate save up for the guy you just saw
[14826.61s -> 14827.91s]  Yeah
[14827.91s -> 14832.82s]  I gotta go into more caves underground more feel like i'm lacking
[14832.90s -> 14855.16s]  Well, I did upgrade a lot last time or I wonder if it'd be about five. Maybe i'll get from this
[14855.40s -> 14862.50s]  What am I lacking? I feel like the water is not a problem
[14874.39s -> 14888.32s]  Um maximum water at six. I don't think I have enough to do anything. I don't think I can do anything
[14888.64s -> 14903.76s]  I could do health health is for stamina health is okay
[14903.84s -> 14916.36s]  I could do health or save it to be able to get somebody save it save it save it save it
[14916.68s -> 14933.52s]  There is a new party member outside. Yeah, i'll save it. We want friends. We don't need upgrades. No health. No health
[14933.76s -> 14949.44s]  I think we've got plenty of health. Although I say that when we've seen a couple of
[14950.30s -> 14959.20s]  Tragedies that happened very quickly so I can understand that maybe we don't have enough health, but i'll save it
[14969.80s -> 14982.42s]  Who govu got his neck snapped it was really sad. I felt so bad about it. All right, so here's the plan
[14983.14s -> 14988.21s]  Um before it gets too too late. We'll call it here. I'm gonna
[14988.99s -> 14994.32s]  Upgrade well not upgrade. I'm gonna where was that person?
[15007.96s -> 15008.76s]  No
[15008.76s -> 15012.60s]  How do I get out get out?
[15012.68s -> 15015.16s]  shit

[15131.86s -> 15136.66s]  Yeah, yeah, I think the the
[15138.90s -> 15145.84s]  The later night I think just kind of lets me just kind of breathe a little bit
