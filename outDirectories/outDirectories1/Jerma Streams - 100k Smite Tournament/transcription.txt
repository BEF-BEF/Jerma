[0.06s -> 6.79s]  That shit does not want you to know what the fuck was that you all the new players learn and they get used to it.
[6.79s -> 10.88s]  It's really bad. All right.
[10.88s -> 11.68s]  I'm live now.
[12.38s -> 14.88s]  Can somebody confirm in my house Russell?
[15.42s -> 15.82s]  Oh shit.
[15.82s -> 16.92s]  We're missing a player.
[17.12s -> 18.72s]  Yeah, how do you sprint?
[18.72s -> 19.62s]  Is it autosprint?
[20.22s -> 23.12s]  You're always moving the full speed as long as you're autoing you slow down.
[23.12s -> 28.72s]  That's the only way you slow down or someone says we literally don't have our fifth player.
[31.05s -> 33.69s]  Oh, you're like 12.
[33.89s -> 36.09s]  Yeah, how do I learn my abilities?
[36.09s -> 36.99s]  How do I see my bill?
[36.99s -> 37.69s]  Okay, got it.
[37.89s -> 40.29s]  Can you press K to read them or just add the F keys?
[40.29s -> 41.19s]  F1, F2, F3.
[44.42s -> 45.12s]  All right guys.
[45.12s -> 47.22s]  Hi, it's me, German985.
[47.22s -> 47.82s]  Welcome.
[48.02s -> 49.92s]  I told you about this smite tournament that I'm in.
[50.72s -> 53.62s]  I'm going to give you just a very quick rundown of what's going to happen here.
[53.82s -> 57.62s]  So everybody in chat can yell at the other people that come into chat in like 10 minutes
[58.22s -> 61.82s]  yelling at me as to why I have not like crashed car and laughed about it.
[62.62s -> 64.32s]  Like we did a couple nights ago.
[64.82s -> 66.22s]  This is a very important tournament.
[66.22s -> 68.02s]  This is a hundred thousand dollar smite tournament.
[68.70s -> 69.90s]  Mizkif is hosting it.
[70.60s -> 71.90s]  I'm taking this pretty seriously.
[71.90s -> 73.20s]  I'm going to try as best I can.
[73.60s -> 74.40s]  No cam.
[74.60s -> 75.60s]  We're doing I'm in a call.
[75.60s -> 76.40s]  I got my team here.
[76.40s -> 77.30s]  I'm a team captain.
[78.00s -> 78.70s]  He's doing his team.
[78.90s -> 83.50s]  Yeah, I'm doing my TF2 voice because I have to be able to talk and then tell people where I am.
[84.36s -> 87.26s]  And yes, I'm in my underwear and playing completely naked because I wasn't ready.
[87.26s -> 88.16s]  Couldn't take a shower.
[88.86s -> 90.56s]  It started to kind of early Pacific time.
[91.42s -> 93.72s]  So I've literally have I've got hardly clothes on.
[95.03s -> 96.53s]  So just for you to know that.
[97.48s -> 97.88s]  Okay.
[99.37s -> 100.87s]  So I'm going to jump back in here.
[100.97s -> 104.74s]  We have my best friend poke.
[105.14s -> 106.34s]  You should probably saw from that tweet.
[107.68s -> 109.18s]  He's what is poke playing?
[109.88s -> 111.38s]  I guess we just go over it in the roles.
[112.24s -> 118.49s]  It's me sure for poke no-go Russell and our coaches weekend.
[118.86s -> 121.56s]  You can I'm sure you probably watching poke stream probably by this point.
[121.86s -> 122.06s]  All right.
[122.06s -> 122.46s]  Here we go.
[122.76s -> 123.96s]  But I yeah, I'm going to be serious.
[123.96s -> 124.56s]  No cam.
[124.56s -> 125.96s]  I'm not going to be like, oh, hey, look at me.
[125.96s -> 127.06s]  I'm a fucking dickhead.
[127.54s -> 129.94s]  No, this is serious gamer time right now.
[129.94s -> 131.14s]  This is a hundred thousand dollar tournament.
[132.06s -> 132.26s]  All right.
[132.26s -> 132.86s]  You guys get it.
[133.06s -> 133.46s]  You get it.
[133.96s -> 135.56s]  This is just my perspective.
[136.06s -> 139.16s]  If you want to go watch the big stream, that's on ms.
[139.16s -> 139.86s]  Kiff's channel.
[141.62s -> 142.62s]  Why don't you stay here?
[143.00s -> 143.50s]  Okay.
[143.80s -> 144.20s]  All right.
[144.60s -> 145.00s]  Look at me.
[149.88s -> 152.49s]  That's my support character Aries.
[152.49s -> 152.79s]  All right.

[158.03s -> 158.73s]  I like being.
[158.73s -> 159.73s]  I like the chains.
[159.73s -> 160.53s]  I like the whips.
[160.53s -> 161.23s]  I like all of it.
[161.23s -> 161.83s]  You know what I'm saying?
[163.27s -> 164.17s]  Oh, yeah.
[165.35s -> 165.55s]  All right.
[165.55s -> 166.35s]  So who all right.
[166.35s -> 168.55s]  So who's going to play what are we locking in?
[168.55s -> 169.25s]  Let's lock it in.
[169.82s -> 170.42s]  I'm support.
[170.42s -> 170.92s]  I'm Aries.
[171.02s -> 171.42s]  Okay.

[177.50s -> 178.50s]  I'm my plea Artemis.
[181.38s -> 182.18s]  I'm whatever.
[182.18s -> 190.06s]  I feel like God.
[190.46s -> 191.06s]  No, I did.
[191.06s -> 191.26s]  I did.
[191.26s -> 191.56s]  I did.
[191.56s -> 192.46s]  I'm playing right now.
[192.56s -> 194.96s]  The only thing is, is when I, when I attack people, the fucking
[194.96s -> 196.46s]  blood splatters bigger than my forehead.
[196.46s -> 197.76s]  So like, well, how do I get that off?
[198.06s -> 200.26s]  Like, yeah.
[201.86s -> 202.36s]  I'm playing.
[204.36s -> 205.16s]  You got banned.
[205.66s -> 205.86s]  Yeah.
[205.86s -> 208.36s]  It says the owner of this website, high red studios has banned
[208.36s -> 210.46s]  you temporary from accessing accessing this website.
[211.66s -> 213.26s]  Refreshing a little bit too much.
[213.99s -> 214.39s]  Who are you playing?
[214.39s -> 216.62s]  No Cosmo is a Nami.
[217.92s -> 218.72s]  What does this do?
[219.12s -> 219.92s]  It might be the skin.
[219.92s -> 220.42s]  You have one.
[220.82s -> 222.42s]  If you do, did you buy a skin?
[222.42s -> 223.22s]  Did you have a skin on?
[223.52s -> 224.02s]  Yeah.
[224.12s -> 227.11s]  This thing see that no, it's crits.
[230.06s -> 230.56s]  You see it.
[230.66s -> 231.26s]  I'm going in.
[231.26s -> 231.86s]  I'll check.
[233.04s -> 233.24s]  Yeah.
[233.24s -> 234.04s]  I am not going to lie.
[234.04s -> 234.94s]  I need drops.
[235.44s -> 235.64s]  Yeah.
[235.64s -> 236.24s]  I think it works now.
[236.34s -> 237.24s]  I drops enabled.
[237.24s -> 238.84s]  Can I can anybody cry?
[239.14s -> 241.74s]  Is it a drops actually enabled on my channel at least?
[242.56s -> 243.26s]  Yeah, they are.
[243.36s -> 243.76s]  Okay.
[243.86s -> 245.16s]  You guys drops are enabled.
[245.79s -> 247.29s]  That would be embarrassing if they weren't.
[248.37s -> 250.97s]  Oh, you're talking about the numbers on your screen that are
[250.97s -> 251.27s]  huge.
[251.27s -> 251.97s]  Yeah.
[252.07s -> 252.57s]  Yeah.
[253.97s -> 255.57s]  Can't change that thing.
[255.57s -> 258.57s]  So now that you mentioned it, I mean double check the numbers.
[258.57s -> 260.07s]  That shit is fucking huge.
[260.37s -> 263.92s]  Oh, try now.
[264.85s -> 265.65s]  You can't jump.
[265.65s -> 266.25s]  That's awkward.
[266.25s -> 269.05s]  Yeah, you can you can you can it should be low.
[269.05s -> 270.45s]  You just can't auto and jump.
[270.45s -> 270.65s]  Yeah.
[270.65s -> 272.68s]  No, you can't use abilities and do it at the same time.
[272.88s -> 273.08s]  Okay.
[273.08s -> 274.18s]  It's combat scaling.
[274.18s -> 275.28s]  I think is what you want to turn down.
[275.28s -> 276.48s]  It's under user interface.
[277.66s -> 277.96s]  All right.
[277.96s -> 289.45s]  Yeah, again, for people just coming in now, this is again,
[289.45s -> 290.55s]  I'm going to make this really clear.
[290.95s -> 292.15s]  This is a gamer stream.
[292.25s -> 292.85s]  I've got a team here.
[292.85s -> 293.75s]  I'm the team captain.
[293.75s -> 294.75s]  We've been practicing.
[295.05s -> 296.55s]  Well, we did a little bit last night.
[297.45s -> 301.05s]  This is $100,000 tournament, no cam, no comedy.
[301.25s -> 303.15s]  This is not going to be that's not going to be a funny stream.
[303.15s -> 305.35s]  This is going to be like a we're playing the game trying to
[305.35s -> 306.85s]  win a hundred thousand goddamn dollars.
[306.85s -> 308.15s]  Okay, there's a hundred thousand dollars.
[308.15s -> 312.10s]  You understand I'm not going to like I'm not going to jump
[312.10s -> 316.71s]  into a tower and talk about like Dunkin Donuts today.
[316.81s -> 319.91s]  Like this is for $100,000 that not today.
[321.09s -> 322.39s]  I'm being serious today.
[323.51s -> 324.81s]  They're only thousand viewers.
[325.91s -> 326.81s]  That can't be right.
[327.11s -> 328.61s]  That actually can't be right.
[329.18s -> 329.98s]  That can't be right.
[329.98s -> 330.08s]  Now.
[330.08s -> 331.68s]  I only have a thousand viewers right now.
[333.25s -> 333.65s]  Whatever.
[334.05s -> 335.95s]  Okay, this is a gamer stream.
[338.48s -> 340.48s]  But yeah, I'm actually going to try to take it seriously.
[340.58s -> 341.28s]  We'll have fun.
[341.28s -> 341.88s]  Don't worry.
[342.87s -> 343.57s]  Don't worry.
[343.97s -> 345.77s]  Green screen stream is in like two days.
[345.77s -> 346.27s]  Relax.
[356.45s -> 356.95s]  True.
[357.85s -> 360.65s]  Also like what combos well with Ares anything?
[360.65s -> 363.15s]  Yeah, they both do both of those will be fine.
[363.65s -> 366.65s]  Artemis like you'll do a lot for the lane as Ares you should
[366.65s -> 367.55s]  clear and do a lot.
[367.55s -> 368.95s]  So Artemis will be fine.
[368.95s -> 370.95s]  And if you want to go for kills, you also do a lot of damage
[370.95s -> 371.35s]  on Ares.
[372.95s -> 378.95s]  Okay, so let me just for my brain again speed attack mid lane
[379.45s -> 380.65s]  then go wherever I want.
[380.65s -> 383.25s]  Make sure those three minute timers bang, bang, bang.
[383.25s -> 385.55s]  Make sure blue is dropped for solo every time.
[385.95s -> 387.25s]  That's I've got that right, right?
[387.65s -> 388.05s]  Yep.
[388.15s -> 388.55s]  All right.
[389.65s -> 390.05s]  Got it.
[392.16s -> 394.16s]  Yeah, I think I think I understand this character a lot.
[395.62s -> 397.02s]  This is like a perfect character for me.
[397.32s -> 400.52s]  That works go if you can like close out of this and I want
[400.52s -> 402.32s]  you to go in a regular game just so you know where to start
[402.32s -> 403.82s]  like what to do at the very beginning of the game.
[404.12s -> 404.92s]  We have time.
[405.32s -> 408.62s]  Yeah, they said 330 would be when we started so it should
[408.62s -> 409.22s]  take like one minute.
[410.12s -> 415.88s]  Okay, so we have good sir three dirty as I'm like three
[415.88s -> 416.68s]  dirty EST.
[416.88s -> 418.38s]  Yeah, okay.
[418.68s -> 423.38s]  So I go to where go to you just go to training and go to
[423.38s -> 424.08s]  conquest.
[425.18s -> 426.38s]  I'm not going to buy the burger skin.
[426.38s -> 429.18s]  I don't even play with that character go to play and then
[429.18s -> 429.58s]  training.
[431.02s -> 435.92s]  This is in queue training and then conquest and then do easy
[435.92s -> 436.22s]  bots.
[436.22s -> 437.92s]  Just the first one and quick play.
[437.92s -> 440.62s]  Yeah, it'll start the game up.
[441.12s -> 443.92s]  These kids are fun sick guys.
[444.32s -> 446.32s]  I'm going to tell you I'm just going to be really realistic
[446.32s -> 446.52s]  here.
[446.52s -> 448.62s]  People will we win the smite tournament?
[449.62s -> 451.62s]  I think at least one or two people have just installed
[451.62s -> 453.52s]  the game an hour ago on the team.
[453.92s -> 456.22s]  I don't I don't think we're going to get to the end will
[456.22s -> 458.52s]  do probably be okay.
[459.02s -> 459.62s]  We'll probably do.
[459.62s -> 460.22s]  All right.
[463.68s -> 465.28s]  I can't buy the cheeseburger skin.
[465.28s -> 467.18s]  I don't play with the cheeseburger character.
[472.45s -> 478.49s]  I believe I believe would you say retirement?
[478.69s -> 483.30s]  Stream wait, would you say I need to know what you said?
[483.90s -> 485.50s]  Oh embarrassment stream it.
[486.30s -> 488.40s]  I'm telling you my I might surprise some people here
[488.40s -> 491.10s]  because I the last couple days I really talked I took this
[491.10s -> 491.90s]  pretty seriously.
[492.60s -> 494.10s]  I was like what character do I want to play?
[494.30s -> 495.50s]  I want to get familiar with it.
[495.90s -> 498.00s]  But guys I've played smite for like a thousand hours.
[498.00s -> 500.30s]  This is obviously like five six seven years ago now, but
[500.30s -> 500.80s]  whatever.
[501.63s -> 502.63s]  I think I'll do okay.
[503.13s -> 507.24s]  And look if I'm if I go 0 and 10 then then I'll buy then
[507.24s -> 508.74s]  I'll tell a couple of jokes.
[508.74s -> 510.34s]  Okay, and then we can relax.
[511.20s -> 512.10s]  I think we've got a good chance.
[512.10s -> 515.94s]  I really do although not maybe not the first game if we're
[515.94s -> 517.84s]  playing the top seed first.
[518.24s -> 520.24s]  So this will be a great indication if we do.
[520.24s -> 523.99s]  Okay, if we actually beat this team, apparently this is
[523.99s -> 525.95s]  one of the better teams, right?
[525.95s -> 526.45s]  You know what I'm saying?
[529.92s -> 531.72s]  But what I'm saying is essentially is this free points.
[532.56s -> 534.96s]  I don't think we're going to win the tournament, but I
[534.96s -> 535.66s]  could be wrong.
[538.35s -> 540.15s]  I'm just excited to participate should be fun.
[541.28s -> 542.38s]  It's probably auto.
[542.38s -> 544.18s]  No, no your two is what you want at the beginning.
[544.58s -> 548.48s]  Oh, so you want two and then one then three you'll level
[548.48s -> 550.18s]  your three second.
[550.18s -> 552.38s]  Just so you have a safety ability to like run away, but
[552.38s -> 554.58s]  you're going to match your two your one your alt and then
[554.58s -> 554.98s]  your three.
[555.58s -> 559.18s]  So just one just curious.
[560.38s -> 563.28s]  Should I be should I be auto build as Aries or should I
[563.38s -> 564.48s]  have a specific build?
[565.08s -> 567.88s]  Realistically, I'll write you out a build right now.
[567.88s -> 569.68s]  It's trying to help you because I don't know what the
[569.68s -> 570.68s]  auto builds are building and everything.
[570.68s -> 573.58s]  So weird why I mean, I was just going to look up a build
[573.58s -> 577.18s]  so I do appreciate that you also.
[577.18s -> 580.28s]  Yeah, this game apparently this jungler because I'm a
[580.28s -> 580.88s]  jungler.
[581.78s -> 584.68s]  I figured that because we were talking in the in the
[584.68s -> 585.78s]  before a couple days ago.
[585.78s -> 587.88s]  It was like, okay, who knows how to play the game?
[588.58s -> 592.68s]  It's like I do sure for does I think poke said he played
[592.68s -> 595.08s]  for a little bit Russell said he's played it like years
[595.08s -> 598.88s]  ago, but I think like me and sure for had the most game
[598.88s -> 600.78s]  knowledge, right?
[601.80s -> 604.00s]  So it's like, okay, I so I kind of had to play jungle
[604.10s -> 606.80s]  even though I'm you know, we're talking we're talking
[606.80s -> 607.60s]  Little League, right?
[609.02s -> 612.22s]  If you take the best Little League player in the world,
[613.56s -> 615.86s]  he's going to get struck out by a Major League Baseball
[615.86s -> 616.26s]  player.
[616.87s -> 618.37s]  I'm just that's just a fact.
[618.97s -> 620.27s]  So right.
[620.27s -> 621.17s]  That's what we're doing.
[625.43s -> 626.23s]  What do you mean wrong?
[627.16s -> 629.86s]  And by the way, they're all these are all gamers in the
[629.86s -> 634.60s]  practice last night sure for was fucking dominating poke
[634.80s -> 635.50s]  dominating.
[635.70s -> 636.50s]  I'm not concerned.
[636.50s -> 637.50s]  I think we're going to be fine.
[637.90s -> 641.10s]  It's I'm going to turn out to be the Little League batboy.
[641.78s -> 643.18s]  I'm not even on the Little League team.
[643.18s -> 650.07s]  You'll see or whenever you can safely just grab that go
[650.07s -> 650.77s]  back to your lane.
[650.87s -> 652.87s]  And then whenever that blue buff respawns you want to do
[652.87s -> 653.97s]  that every single time.
[658.66s -> 661.76s]  And I should be just I should just upgrade one three and
[661.76s -> 662.26s]  then two.
[662.96s -> 667.66s]  Well, obviously for whenever I can but okay, and then
[667.66s -> 668.16s]  no-go.
[668.16s -> 670.96s]  I just type the build in the chat.
[671.06s -> 673.96s]  It's the same build folks going so you're just going to
[673.96s -> 674.36s]  do that.
[674.56s -> 674.96s]  Same thing.
[674.96s -> 677.36s]  Both the first second third and it doesn't matter about
[677.36s -> 677.96s]  last hitting.
[678.86s -> 681.16s]  It gives you extra gold if you all this whole time.
[681.16s -> 681.96s]  I was like, whatever.
[681.96s -> 684.66s]  Oh, no, I got a blast it then you don't in this game.
[684.66s -> 686.66s]  You don't do it like you definitely want to try but you
[686.66s -> 687.36s]  don't do it like League.
[687.36s -> 688.16s]  It's not you sit there.
[688.16s -> 690.06s]  You wait if you just want to power clear the lane as fast
[690.06s -> 690.56s]  as possible.
[691.76s -> 695.06s]  I think we're getting a we should be getting in Lobby
[695.06s -> 695.46s]  soon, right?
[695.46s -> 697.16s]  Oh, it is a way your autos are a ways.
[697.16s -> 698.16s]  Yeah, they go through creeps.
[698.16s -> 700.86s]  And then I'm not my way my my to do.
[700.86s -> 701.26s]  Yep.
[701.56s -> 704.16s]  So you'll just auto into it and it should clear very quick.
[704.16s -> 705.46s]  You're one of the fastest clearing character.
[706.46s -> 708.06s]  So what are we doing?
[708.36s -> 709.76s]  Whoa, what happened?
[715.00s -> 715.90s]  We have 10 minutes.
[717.10s -> 719.00s]  So they said we were I think you guys are going to be in
[719.00s -> 721.40s]  a party or in the custom game pretty soon.
[724.97s -> 725.57s]  Great.
[730.76s -> 732.76s]  I have not my mom my notifications turned off.
[732.76s -> 733.66s]  Why would that even happen?
[741.02s -> 743.12s]  So we should we should get in a party then right?
[745.09s -> 746.99s]  Okay, let's do that because somebody just tried to like
[746.99s -> 748.59s]  add me to their fucking party.
[748.59s -> 751.29s]  And there's some we got it.
[751.29s -> 752.19s]  We got to go away from that.
[755.38s -> 757.28s]  I think I have all of your in-game names, but I don't
[757.28s -> 758.58s]  have Russell.
[758.58s -> 761.08s]  I don't have you and I don't have no go.
[770.15s -> 772.35s]  You want to type your in-game names?
[773.65s -> 774.15s]  I'm watching.
[774.15s -> 776.90s]  I'm watching Russell Russell, right?
[777.10s -> 779.90s]  Oops, my mic Russell is literally like down in the game
[779.90s -> 781.30s]  right now and watching the tutorial.
[781.70s -> 782.30s]  What'd you say?
[782.80s -> 784.60s]  You're downloading the game right now and watching a YouTube
[784.60s -> 785.00s]  tutorial.
[785.00s -> 785.80s]  How to play smite.
[785.80s -> 786.40s]  What are you doing?
[786.60s -> 788.40s]  I've had this game since 2013.
[788.40s -> 789.40s]  Are you doing man?
[790.80s -> 791.50s]  Excuse me.
[792.80s -> 794.30s]  Wait, are you guys waiting for me?
[794.90s -> 796.80s]  Yeah, just waiting on the video.
[797.00s -> 801.30s]  Are you watching the in-game embedded YouTube video?
[803.06s -> 803.86s]  Do they still do that?
[805.66s -> 806.06s]  Guys?
[806.06s -> 809.47s]  I don't I don't I want to go on his down.
[810.73s -> 815.86s]  Are you sure I'm in pokes team or in his party that that was
[815.86s -> 819.56s]  me super me automatically and then you're gonna want to
[819.56s -> 819.96s]  turn that off.
[819.96s -> 822.36s]  If you press look, I think it's Kay.
[822.36s -> 823.16s]  Are you in game still?
[823.46s -> 825.96s]  Yeah, press K and see if it says that right there.
[826.16s -> 828.76s]  And if not, it'll turn off that's auto skill.
[828.76s -> 829.66s]  You can turn that off.
[829.96s -> 831.36s]  And then you can close that.
[833.36s -> 834.86s]  So who are we missing in the party?
[836.86s -> 837.56s]  He's in a game.
[837.86s -> 838.66s]  Yeah, I can leave.
[838.66s -> 839.06s]  I can leave.
[839.06s -> 839.46s]  I'm gonna leave.
[841.10s -> 843.80s]  I think they're gonna give us they're gonna give us the
[844.80s -> 845.60s]  the ID.
[845.60s -> 846.30s]  I think soon.
[846.90s -> 848.00s]  Is anyone nervous?
[848.10s -> 848.90s]  I'm just curious.
[848.90s -> 851.50s]  I'm not saying I am but I was asking if anyone here.
[851.50s -> 854.00s]  Oh God, I hear no, I've already accepted.
[854.00s -> 857.70s]  If we go if we go like oh and 30 because there's a voice
[857.70s -> 858.80s]  chat in game.
[859.80s -> 861.90s]  Why don't why are you like unhappy about that?
[861.90s -> 864.70s]  Sure for because I don't want to hear anyone twice.
[865.00s -> 865.50s]  Oh, okay.
[865.50s -> 866.40s]  Well, that's understandable.
[866.50s -> 869.90s]  I want to hear you guys only once for pure clarity.
[870.20s -> 870.60s]  Okay.
[871.60s -> 872.80s]  I just did push the toggle.
[872.80s -> 874.50s]  So you should hear me twice.
[874.50s -> 879.47s]  No, I just have the Jabberwockies the Jabberwockies.
[880.47s -> 881.47s]  Are you talking about stuff?
[881.87s -> 882.97s]  That's not who I was thinking of.
[883.07s -> 884.97s]  Tell them to watch your smite video.
[885.97s -> 888.17s]  I dropped your starter items in there and then your full
[888.17s -> 889.27s]  build is the one right after.
[889.37s -> 890.17s]  Each of the volume.
[890.67s -> 891.07s]  Okay.
[891.17s -> 891.47s]  All right.
[891.47s -> 891.97s]  Sounds good.
[893.40s -> 895.60s]  Should I turn off auto build before we get in the game?
[895.60s -> 895.80s]  Then?
[895.80s -> 898.20s]  Yeah, I would you can do it in settings.
[898.20s -> 905.02s]  I think if anybody wants to know how to play that's a pretty
[905.02s -> 907.02s]  good tutorials back in like 2012.
[907.12s -> 908.92s]  If anyone was curious how to play the game.
[909.42s -> 911.02s]  You have smite Wario's.
[911.22s -> 913.62s]  Yeah, I bought I bought this back in 2013.
[913.62s -> 914.72s]  So I probably watched it.
[915.62s -> 919.02s]  Yeah, it's guides for actually have a guide for Aries if
[919.02s -> 919.72s]  you want to watch it.
[919.72s -> 920.92s]  It's probably got some good tips in it.
[921.52s -> 924.02s]  I'm going to go watch that right now immediately.
[924.12s -> 925.82s]  It's on your second or first channel.
[925.82s -> 926.82s]  It's on the first first channel.
[926.82s -> 927.92s]  It's definitely worth watching.
[927.92s -> 933.17s]  I'd say it's not something that I wish I deleted but it's
[933.17s -> 933.87s]  funny deleted.
[933.87s -> 934.27s]  Oh, yeah.
[934.37s -> 935.77s]  If you guys aren't in the game by the way, you can press
[935.77s -> 937.97s]  escape and then go to guides and turn everything you want
[937.97s -> 939.07s]  off all right there.
[939.77s -> 942.27s]  Gold Fury is like very guide.
[942.57s -> 943.97s]  Yeah, do it says guides.
[946.27s -> 946.97s]  I have an okay.
[946.97s -> 948.67s]  Let me just with with you guys here.
[948.67s -> 951.07s]  I have an Aries video, right?
[951.07s -> 952.57s]  I did like three or four of them didn't I?
[954.07s -> 955.17s]  Self promo.
[955.67s -> 957.37s]  I don't give a fuck about that video.
[957.37s -> 958.67s]  I would delete it right now if I could.
[961.24s -> 961.74s]  Don't I have?
[961.74s -> 962.24s]  Yeah, I did.
[962.34s -> 963.04s]  Did I delete it?
[963.04s -> 965.54s]  I might have deleted it is just the Anubis one the only
[965.54s -> 966.24s]  one that's left.
[971.24s -> 972.14s]  Is it still there?
[972.64s -> 973.94s]  Oh man, is it still?
[973.94s -> 974.54s]  Oh, it's there.
[974.54s -> 975.84s]  Okay, that's funny.
[977.32s -> 977.92s]  All right, let's go.
[981.38s -> 982.48s]  Are your abilities at the queue?
[983.48s -> 986.98s]  No, sorry, it's two two first two first two level your
[986.98s -> 990.44s]  three of ones and then match your one match your two
[990.44s -> 991.74s]  your one you're all your three.
[992.74s -> 994.14s]  Wait, what's the title of the video?
[996.04s -> 997.44s]  It's this what is it?
[997.44s -> 998.64s]  Oh, man.
[999.74s -> 1000.44s]  What does it say?
[1002.60s -> 1004.10s]  This dude's a beast.
[1004.40s -> 1005.30s]  Holy shit.
[1005.30s -> 1009.53s]  I was trying so hard Aries God of War.
[1009.53s -> 1010.83s]  This dude's a beast.
[1011.23s -> 1015.13s]  Might be I hope I hope he watches it and hey by the way,
[1015.13s -> 1017.63s]  I'm gonna act like yeah, like did you get anything from
[1017.63s -> 1017.93s]  that?
[1019.08s -> 1020.28s]  No, like yeah, did you get something from that?
[1020.28s -> 1021.08s]  Like I hope you did.
[1021.38s -> 1022.18s]  I think I'm kidding.
[1022.18s -> 1023.28s]  You know, hopefully you learned something.
[1025.18s -> 1027.48s]  Q w e r q w e r.
[1027.48s -> 1028.78s]  Yeah, that's like way better for me.
[1028.78s -> 1032.05s]  Hold on settings abilities.
[1033.63s -> 1035.63s]  You just can't change your w or you won't be able to walk
[1035.83s -> 1038.53s]  I was gonna say it's gonna I feel like that's gonna fuck
[1038.53s -> 1039.13s]  with you more.
[1042.47s -> 1043.87s]  Are you sure you want to switch this no-co?
[1044.37s -> 1046.97s]  No, 100% because I played League for a really long time.
[1047.87s -> 1048.57s]  All right, man.
[1048.67s -> 1049.27s]  I believe you.
[1052.33s -> 1053.83s]  You're breaking your no comedy rule.
[1053.83s -> 1057.13s]  We're not playing the no comedy serious.
[1057.63s -> 1061.23s]  Rule is only for when I'm in the actual game.
[1062.72s -> 1064.82s]  I'm not probably not gonna look at chat really much at all.
[1068.83s -> 1071.03s]  The no comedy rules only for game moments.
[1075.97s -> 1077.37s]  Are y'all getting the battle pass?
[1077.77s -> 1079.07s]  I think I bought it already.
[1083.55s -> 1085.95s]  I don't know how much even is this in like money?
[1088.26s -> 1091.36s]  Wait, how do you battle past trying to think?
[1092.16s -> 1094.66s]  It's q w e r is League.
[1096.37s -> 1108.72s]  What's 16,000 gems.
[1108.72s -> 1110.62s]  I've never had this many gems in my whole life.
[1110.62s -> 1111.32s]  This whole game.
[1111.82s -> 1113.52s]  Do you feel freaking rich right now?
[1114.95s -> 1117.95s]  I just I am like I look up at there and I'm just like I just
[1117.95s -> 1121.35s]  I bought the 400 gem bakasura metal skin.
[1122.54s -> 1124.44s]  It's like I kind of feel like I need to have one of the crazy
[1124.44s -> 1124.84s]  ones.
[1125.04s -> 1126.44s]  Does box or have a crazy one?
[1128.90s -> 1129.90s]  That's some pretty good skins.
[1130.40s -> 1131.00s]  They're not nuts.
[1131.00s -> 1131.90s]  The craziest one.
[1131.90s -> 1133.80s]  You probably can't buy unless they gave it to you.
[1135.00s -> 1137.50s]  This is the one I'm going to be using sick.
[1139.66s -> 1140.46s]  Oh, wait, I can play.
[1140.46s -> 1142.26s]  Is this the stranger things?
[1142.96s -> 1145.14s]  Oh, yeah, special nuts crazy.
[1145.14s -> 1146.24s]  You walk around kind of creepy.
[1148.48s -> 1149.48s]  I don't but I don't know.
[1150.18s -> 1152.58s]  Okay, can I buy this if I've never seen an episode of stranger
[1152.58s -> 1152.98s]  things?
[1153.62s -> 1156.02s]  Yeah, I mean they just look like little monster things.
[1159.03s -> 1159.63s]  This one's cool.
[1162.40s -> 1163.80s]  This one's too cool for me though.
[1163.80s -> 1164.70s]  I kind of like them.
[1165.20s -> 1167.30s]  I missed this bakasura like I told you last night.
[1167.90s -> 1168.80s]  Who's the burger?
[1170.03s -> 1172.13s]  Well, then play the OG bakasura, bro.
[1172.33s -> 1172.83s]  I know.
[1175.74s -> 1176.64s]  Is the burger good?
[1177.24s -> 1177.94s]  Yeah, he's pretty good.
[1177.94s -> 1180.14s]  He's like kind of easy.
[1180.14s -> 1182.04s]  Like when you're solo playing you don't really dial up.
[1182.44s -> 1183.44s]  You're a support though.
[1186.19s -> 1188.69s]  I would anyone know that's the character to goddamn burger.
[1189.59s -> 1191.29s]  There's skins like that all the time.
[1195.37s -> 1198.77s]  Reminds me of the old was it the old TF2 thing they used to
[1198.77s -> 1201.97s]  say if we want to make sure we keep the silhouettes the same.
[1202.17s -> 1204.37s]  We want to make sure you can tell who it is from across the
[1204.37s -> 1204.97s]  whole map.
[1205.77s -> 1207.57s]  I don't want to join a fucking fan club.
[1207.57s -> 1207.97s]  Get out.
[1207.97s -> 1209.47s]  I just finished watching the germ of it.
[1209.47s -> 1210.47s]  I think I'm good on Ares.
[1210.47s -> 1211.17s]  You think you're good to go?
[1211.81s -> 1213.21s]  Yep, I got this.
[1213.31s -> 1214.91s]  I think we're going to win this tournament.
[1214.91s -> 1217.01s]  How do you block all notifications from coming up?
[1219.38s -> 1219.88s]  IDK.
[1220.28s -> 1222.18s]  I don't know because I can't do it.
[1222.18s -> 1224.92s]  Apparently is that going to pop up in the games?
[1225.12s -> 1225.72s]  Hope not.
[1226.39s -> 1227.69s]  No, hope not.
[1228.29s -> 1234.88s]  If it does you'll find out the the the death toll transcendence
[1234.88s -> 1236.08s]  when demon that's all for me.
[1236.48s -> 1240.08s]  Yep, you and that's first second third like that's in order
[1240.08s -> 1242.18s]  and fully build the item before you start another item.
[1243.68s -> 1246.42s]  How do you have the crazy skins?
[1246.62s -> 1250.52s]  So if you are in game and you type in like you can search at
[1250.52s -> 1256.64s]  the top transcendence till it'll all be there.
[1257.04s -> 1258.14s]  Can I buy death toll?
[1258.14s -> 1258.54s]  There we go.
[1258.54s -> 1259.14s]  I'm on D&D.
[1259.14s -> 1261.84s]  No, you already have a starter.
[1262.34s -> 1265.54s]  You only buy one starter item that I'm going to sell and then
[1265.54s -> 1267.44s]  sell and do this, right?
[1268.48s -> 1269.28s]  So, okay.
[1271.57s -> 1272.97s]  This is the other God I would be playing.
[1274.77s -> 1275.67s]  Why can't I buy it?
[1276.67s -> 1278.47s]  I'm back with them are locked.
[1278.47s -> 1279.37s]  Are you in the base?
[1279.97s -> 1282.97s]  Yeah, are you clicking on like one of the higher ones like
[1282.97s -> 1285.47s]  death's embrace or something instead of no, I'm literally
[1285.47s -> 1286.37s]  clicking death's goal.
[1286.47s -> 1287.37s]  Should I get this one?
[1287.87s -> 1289.57s]  You have the gold you have six with the old.
[1290.67s -> 1291.97s]  I have five thousand.
[1295.50s -> 1297.30s]  You can't change your starter item.
[1297.90s -> 1299.80s]  I sold it because you left the base already.
[1299.80s -> 1301.30s]  Yeah, that's why it's because you already left the base.
[1302.70s -> 1303.70s]  Are you would buy one?
[1303.70s -> 1305.20s]  That's your item for the game.
[1305.20s -> 1307.90s]  Would it be weird if in Miz Kiff's smite tournament?
[1307.90s -> 1310.80s]  I played as Miz Kiff and just did all the voice spams and
[1310.80s -> 1311.60s]  was like annoying.
[1313.88s -> 1317.28s]  Does it really matter as long as you don't think it's weird?
[1317.68s -> 1318.38s]  You do you man.
[1318.38s -> 1318.98s]  Exactly.
[1318.98s -> 1320.48s]  It's from let your means be dreams.

[1325.52s -> 1327.42s]  I can I got a random DM.
[1327.42s -> 1329.12s]  I just didn't know what to say.
[1330.06s -> 1332.06s]  I was like, yeah, I've played smite before.
[1332.56s -> 1335.36s]  It's not like I begged him in public to make sure I was able
[1335.36s -> 1336.16s]  to play today.
[1338.41s -> 1339.31s]  Are you trying to make some money?
[1340.94s -> 1342.24s]  Yeah, let me know when I got to leave.
[1342.94s -> 1344.54s]  What's the first place team win?
[1344.54s -> 1345.84s]  I think this is very important.
[1346.24s -> 1348.64s]  Okay, each 12k each person.

[1356.08s -> 1358.88s]  If you if you buckle up and don't be a problem.
[1360.98s -> 1361.98s]  All right, that sounds good then.
[1364.20s -> 1365.80s]  Yeah, we wanted the best side of you, man.
[1366.83s -> 1368.13s]  No, I am going to be the best.
[1368.13s -> 1368.73s]  That's the thing.
[1368.73s -> 1371.33s]  Like I genuinely believe I am the best.
[1371.53s -> 1372.33s]  Okay, we're fucked.

[1630.37s -> 1631.97s]  Yeah, I didn't want to do the stranger things one.
[1631.97s -> 1634.57s]  I feel like I'm like look like a default enemy from a random

[1668.70s -> 1671.70s]  but you gave me 8,000 or is 10,000 really that should be
[1671.70s -> 1677.40s]  enough if it's available if you go back to buy all yeah,
[1677.40s -> 1679.50s]  if you click on the skin, it should say like this much to
[1679.50s -> 1680.80s]  buy everything and you have to buy everything.
[1681.30s -> 1683.70s]  Oh what no, it's 9,240.
[1683.70s -> 1684.40s]  I don't have enough.
[1685.30s -> 1685.50s]  Okay.
[1685.50s -> 1687.30s]  I sounds like you need to swipe boy.
[1687.50s -> 1690.90s]  I literally am going to minimize my chat at when once
[1690.90s -> 1692.60s]  the game starts because I know I'm going to look over there
[1692.60s -> 1693.70s]  because I'm going to miss something.
[1693.70s -> 1695.80s]  I'm going to miss like I'm going to miss click on something
[1695.80s -> 1697.30s]  and I'm going to see a bunch of Omega wells and it's going
[1697.30s -> 1697.70s]  to fuck with me.
[1697.70s -> 1700.90s]  So I can not gonna look but you get affected that much by
[1700.90s -> 1702.30s]  a little bit of Omega lulz.
[1702.40s -> 1703.50s]  Oh, yeah, of course I do.
[1703.50s -> 1705.80s]  I look over if I have something goes wrong and I see Omega
[1705.80s -> 1707.40s]  low like he sucks so bad.
[1707.40s -> 1708.30s]  I get affects me.
[1708.30s -> 1708.90s]  I can't look at it.
[1708.90s -> 1709.20s]  Okay.
[1709.20s -> 1711.00s]  What if they all start saying poggers?
[1711.00s -> 1712.20s]  He did it instead.
[1712.20s -> 1713.60s]  Then I get way too overconfident.
[1713.60s -> 1714.60s]  Then you're yeah, exactly.
[1714.60s -> 1715.90s]  You're like, oh fuck.
[1715.90s -> 1716.60s]  I did a good play.
[1716.70s -> 1717.60s]  I got to do something else.
[1717.70s -> 1719.60s]  I don't know what I'm going to do and then chat stops blogging.
[1719.60s -> 1720.40s]  You're like fuck now.
[1722.70s -> 1725.00s]  Very affected by the emotes coming at you.
[1725.70s -> 1726.40s]  Yeah, of course.
[1726.70s -> 1729.70s]  I can see the Omega lulz in the corner of my eye without even
[1729.70s -> 1730.20s]  looking at it.
[1730.30s -> 1731.20s]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[1732.10s -> 1733.60s]  What if you saw them spamming?
[1733.90s -> 1734.50s]  Oh my God.
[1734.50s -> 1736.50s]  It's lacari chasing you through the boreal winter.
[1736.50s -> 1737.90s]  Please run and find cover.
[1737.90s -> 1739.10s]  He has bad intentions.
[1740.17s -> 1742.37s]  I would have no idea what the fuck that meant.
[1748.28s -> 1750.18s]  They did me dirty, bro.
[1751.34s -> 1752.84s]  I have that emote just shortened.
[1753.04s -> 1753.64s]  He chasing.
[1754.84s -> 1758.94s]  Yeah, that's too much to type.
[1760.45s -> 1761.85s]  Wait, that's an emote.
[1762.25s -> 1763.65s]  Yeah, you want to see it.
[1764.45s -> 1765.55s]  You can have an emote.
[1765.55s -> 1766.75s]  That's that long.
[1767.39s -> 1769.29s]  Well, it's like a third part.
[1769.29s -> 1771.39s]  Oh, that's insane.
[1772.89s -> 1773.99s]  I think my smite crashed.
[1774.59s -> 1777.29s]  Oh, oh wait.
[1780.33s -> 1782.83s]  So draft that means we are they mirrors in a draft?
[1786.07s -> 1787.17s]  Any any devs are watching?
[1787.17s -> 1788.67s]  I would like a thousand more gems, please.
[1789.92s -> 1790.82s]  They typed it out.
[1790.82s -> 1791.52s]  Let me read this real quick.
[1791.52s -> 1792.42s]  No, there's no bands.
[1792.42s -> 1794.72s]  You're doing draft just because it's an order pick.
[1795.02s -> 1798.82s]  Okay, but so but they can still be a mirror in a draft.
[1801.67s -> 1802.77s]  Think so.
[1809.32s -> 1812.92s]  Yeah, no, there shouldn't be no mirror picks.
[1812.92s -> 1814.82s]  That's why the like the orders actually matters.
[1814.82s -> 1817.22s]  And when you pick it matters, they can take your shit
[1817.22s -> 1818.02s]  or you can take theirs.
[1818.42s -> 1820.54s]  Okay, I got it.
[1821.14s -> 1822.64s]  I don't think they will.
[1822.64s -> 1823.84s]  I think I know what they're going to play.
[1827.89s -> 1830.19s]  Yeah, they probably know everything we're doing, dude.
[1830.29s -> 1830.79s]  What are they doing?
[1830.79s -> 1830.99s]  Dude.
[1830.99s -> 1831.49s]  Oh my God.
[1831.49s -> 1832.19s]  I got an idea.
[1832.49s -> 1835.89s]  What if we do what if we do five Winston's and just fucking
[1835.89s -> 1839.49s]  run that the by the point we five Winston's we just all jump
[1839.49s -> 1840.99s]  and we all go to like mid tower.
[1842.24s -> 1843.14s]  That'd be poggers.
[1843.14s -> 1848.11s]  I know they actually can't I don't think so.
[1849.53s -> 1850.83s]  Wait, there's a character called Winston.
[1857.17s -> 1858.57s]  No people did not like that one.
[1859.63s -> 1860.23s]  I looked it up.
[1860.73s -> 1861.83s]  Why would they not like that?
[1861.83s -> 1862.33s]  I don't know.
[1874.46s -> 1875.66s]  Where's Miz Kiff?
[1875.96s -> 1880.56s]  I want a personal hello and I want a personal in every team
[1880.56s -> 1882.66s]  voice chat him coming in and introducing the event.
[1883.06s -> 1883.46s]  Where is he?
[1883.46s -> 1885.16s]  Then he would be introducing it right now.
[1885.16s -> 1886.16s]  Actually, he's casting it.
[1886.56s -> 1888.26s]  Oh, I thought he was a player.
[1888.66s -> 1889.06s]  I did too.
[1889.06s -> 1891.06s]  He was supposed to play and he's supposed to coach or cast
[1891.06s -> 1892.16s]  and then he wasn't going to do anything.
[1892.16s -> 1893.36s]  And then I don't know what happened.
[1896.88s -> 1898.18s]  So there's no bands.
[1898.58s -> 1901.38s]  Are you able to just be in the call with us the whole time?
[1901.38s -> 1903.08s]  It's the good thing.
[1903.08s -> 1904.58s]  You can't be in the call the entire time.
[1905.08s -> 1906.78s]  Yes, this is going to be interesting.
[1907.18s -> 1908.28s]  Well, there are no picks.
[1908.28s -> 1909.28s]  There's no bands.
[1909.48s -> 1912.38s]  There's orders like the like what order you should pick shit.
[1912.58s -> 1913.58s]  I bought the bundle.
[1914.08s -> 1915.98s]  And I can kind of run you through what they're going to be
[1915.98s -> 1917.18s]  doing with their pigs.
[1917.28s -> 1919.88s]  So if you guys want to weaken your streaming, right?
[1920.38s -> 1920.68s]  Yep.
[1920.78s -> 1922.88s]  So if you guys want to watch somebody kind of put the hands
[1922.88s -> 1926.18s]  in their head and like kind of look down for how long the
[1926.18s -> 1929.78s]  tournament is because that you're going to be like screaming
[1929.78s -> 1931.88s]  at us to do something like just you're going to be like,

[1936.08s -> 1938.78s]  So we can you want to go watch the disappointment.
[1939.38s -> 1941.18s]  It'll be on weekends.
[1941.18s -> 1943.88s]  I thought you were I thought you were here holding our hand
[1943.88s -> 1946.28s]  the entire time and I thought that's what it was going to be
[1946.28s -> 1946.88s]  a first to you.
[1946.98s -> 1948.78s]  Oh my God.
[1949.18s -> 1951.18s]  This is a whole different like ball game.
[1951.18s -> 1953.08s]  I feel like I'm playing a different game right now.
[1953.28s -> 1954.38s]  So now you're scared.
[1954.68s -> 1955.48s]  No, I'm not scared.
[1955.48s -> 1956.08s]  Of course not.
[1956.08s -> 1960.08s]  I still do I have time to get the tea.
[1960.98s -> 1965.08s]  No, you have no time to do anything.
[1965.08s -> 1966.78s]  You have to sit here now.
[1967.08s -> 1968.68s]  Who's drinking tea here me?
[1969.99s -> 1972.93s]  You a tea guy?
[1973.73s -> 1974.73s]  Yeah, I do like tea.
[1974.73s -> 1976.83s]  But what type of tea are you drinking matcha?
[1977.96s -> 1979.16s]  Wait matcha tea is good.
[1979.16s -> 1980.66s]  I actually I actually like matcha tea.
[1980.66s -> 1980.86s]  All right.
[1980.86s -> 1981.36s]  There you go.
[1981.76s -> 1982.06s]  Yeah.
[1982.06s -> 1982.46s]  All right.
[1983.92s -> 1984.92s]  I like green tea.
[1985.12s -> 1990.34s]  I like I don't like Jasmine tea though.
[1990.34s -> 1991.14s]  It's a little too much.
[1992.14s -> 1994.44s]  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Jasmine but green teas.
[1994.84s -> 1995.14s]  All right.
[1995.14s -> 1997.04s]  When I was younger, I used to like a lot of green tea.
[1997.74s -> 1999.14s]  Why are we in queue for seven minutes?
[2000.04s -> 2005.74s]  It just says that because they're still like announcing teams and shit.
[2006.94s -> 2007.44s]  Okay.
[2007.84s -> 2008.14s]  Yeah.
[2008.14s -> 2010.04s]  So don't be nervous poke like chill bitch.
[2010.04s -> 2011.44s]  Damn it is like perfume.
[2011.54s -> 2013.44s]  It is like perfume freaking out.
[2016.44s -> 2017.74s]  Okay, we're going to get Mendo team.
[2018.24s -> 2019.04s]  Leans back with you.
[2019.44s -> 2019.84s]  Yep.
[2020.24s -> 2024.04s]  Oh no, every time every time I drink green green tea with Jasmine.
[2024.04s -> 2026.54s]  I just feel like I'm walking through the perfume section of a Macy's.
[2028.41s -> 2030.31s]  I like getting black tea in my boba.
[2032.16s -> 2032.76s]  That's good.
[2032.86s -> 2036.13s]  Oh, I bought the juicy is a Nami scan.
[2036.13s -> 2040.93s]  I'm going fucking deep a 9200 green gems later.
[2041.73s -> 2042.73s]  So you swiped?
[2043.23s -> 2043.93s]  No, I didn't swipe.
[2043.93s -> 2046.63s]  I had some extra epic coins.
[2046.63s -> 2048.03s]  So I only had to put nine dollars.
[2049.57s -> 2053.27s]  Yeah, dude, they gave me they gave me some some nom noms epic coins
[2053.97s -> 2056.27s]  or volt whatever the fuck you want to go in the epic.
[2061.90s -> 2065.28s]  Wait, so are we all playing at the same time or is it one team at a time?
[2065.58s -> 2066.58s]  I mean two teams at a time.
[2066.58s -> 2067.78s]  I'm pretty sure it's round robin.
[2067.78s -> 2071.18s]  So you all have to be like there's no way you aren't playing at the same time.
[2071.48s -> 2074.88s]  Okay, so are they on the main broadcast?
[2074.88s -> 2078.78s]  Are they just going to be jumping around or are they just picking a game in each round?
[2078.78s -> 2082.68s]  Guess is they're going to pick a game but they're they're like production.
[2082.68s -> 2084.38s]  Dude is from higher from smite.
[2084.38s -> 2084.88s]  So I don't know.
[2084.88s -> 2086.68s]  He might be a little bit into it.
[2089.08s -> 2090.18s]  Oh my god.
[2091.69s -> 2092.49s]  Oh my glob.
[2098.13s -> 2100.03s]  Why can't we just do like a rock-paper-scissors?
[2100.73s -> 2103.53s]  They do these queues 10 minute queue high res.
[2103.53s -> 2107.27s]  What the fuck is this 10 minute queue?
[2107.57s -> 2110.07s]  Hey, the queue times are completely fine.
[2110.07s -> 2112.17s]  And this game is pop.
[2112.17s -> 2113.47s]  Wait, what single limb?
[2113.47s -> 2114.77s]  That's what my dad say.
[2114.77s -> 2115.67s]  So it's not best of three.
[2115.67s -> 2118.57s]  It's like wait, we're going to get knocked out right now potentially.
[2118.57s -> 2119.97s]  No, you're going to win.
[2119.97s -> 2121.87s]  Wait, I thought we were playing everybody once.
[2121.87s -> 2122.47s]  No, German.
[2122.47s -> 2125.57s]  We're going to knock out the other team right now being trolled.
[2126.07s -> 2126.97s]  You have to be getting trolled.
[2126.97s -> 2127.87s]  There's no way.
[2127.87s -> 2130.77s]  Yeah, if you like it's group stages.
[2130.77s -> 2132.07s]  So it has to be where you have to everybody.
[2132.07s -> 2133.37s]  Well, if you don't it's just dumb.
[2133.37s -> 2134.67s]  Yeah, it would make no sense.
[2135.07s -> 2138.87s]  I think what they mean by single limb round Robin is you face everyone
[2138.87s -> 2145.67s]  on your group once top to go bottom to leave type thing and losers
[2145.67s -> 2149.27s]  bracket if this is going to be a long tournament then, huh?
[2150.57s -> 2152.27s]  As long as the strap in.
[2154.32s -> 2154.52s]  All right.
[2154.52s -> 2158.02s]  I got a pee because I you can't play a tournament with a
[2158.92s -> 2161.82s]  I have to there's no way I would be actually wait if you don't
[2161.82s -> 2163.82s]  pee though playing under pressure actually makes you play better
[2163.82s -> 2167.42s]  sometimes I actually made a video about that belt and then come
[2167.42s -> 2167.72s]  back.
[2168.52s -> 2168.82s]  Yeah.
[2168.82s -> 2171.32s]  So what was your your hypothesis?
[2171.72s -> 2173.62s]  Well, my here's my hypothesis inclusion.
[2173.82s -> 2175.02s]  I'm drinking a bunch of tea.
[2175.52s -> 2179.22s]  So right now I have to pee now and I'm drinking a bunch of tea
[2179.22s -> 2181.12s]  or now I have a pee right now.
[2181.12s -> 2183.72s]  Do you know that if you have to pee all more often and you pee
[2183.72s -> 2188.12s]  like really fast like you know, I know but but but listen listen
[2188.12s -> 2188.52s]  to me.
[2189.22s -> 2191.52s]  I'm the captain you listen to the captain.
[2191.72s -> 2192.02s]  Yes, sir.
[2192.02s -> 2192.32s]  Yes, sir.
[2192.32s -> 2192.72s]  Yes, sir.
[2192.92s -> 2196.02s]  If you drink, okay, if you drink too much if you have to pee
[2196.02s -> 2199.42s]  and you keep drinking water and shit, then I'm trying to get
[2199.42s -> 2200.02s]  in front of the pee.
[2200.02s -> 2201.82s]  That's going to have to happen in an hour when we're in the
[2201.82s -> 2203.32s]  game and I can't leave you soon.
[2203.62s -> 2205.92s]  But if you keep holding it in your balls are going to explode
[2205.92s -> 2207.42s]  because pee is sort of the balls.
[2208.12s -> 2208.42s]  All right.
[2208.42s -> 2209.22s]  I'll be right back.
[2209.22s -> 2209.82s]  I'll be right back.
[2210.12s -> 2211.42s]  You already pissing with you.
[2211.42s -> 2211.92s]  I will pin.
[2212.22s -> 2215.14s]  Okay, I'm pissing there.
[2215.14s -> 2218.45s]  I'll be back now.
[2218.45s -> 2219.45s]  Just leave the chat open.
[2219.45s -> 2224.81s]  Whatever vacation beads and agus annual do I have to buy
[2224.81s -> 2226.31s]  those or set those they're free.
[2226.41s -> 2229.21s]  So when you start you get one of them level one and then
[2229.21s -> 2230.21s]  level 12 you get the other one.
[2230.21s -> 2232.81s]  Which one do I get first the purification beads get them
[2232.81s -> 2234.61s]  in the exact order not going to lie.
[2234.61s -> 2239.81s]  That sounds dirty just beads to get out of my purification
[2239.81s -> 2240.11s]  beads.
[2240.11s -> 2242.31s]  Do they do they really think this through when they made
[2242.31s -> 2244.21s]  that I'm not really a beads guy.
[2244.21s -> 2245.51s]  I'm more of a plug kind of guy.
[2245.51s -> 2246.11s]  Oh, okay.
[2246.21s -> 2248.81s]  Yeah, maybe they should rename it to purification plug.
[2249.31s -> 2250.71s]  Yeah, 100% better.
[2255.86s -> 2256.46s]  Oh, hi res.

[2294.34s -> 2295.24s]  I don't believe that.
[2295.34s -> 2296.04s]  I don't believe it either.
[2296.54s -> 2298.04s]  His name is James.
[2298.97s -> 2299.67s]  Oh wait.
[2299.67s -> 2301.07s]  No, that actually does make sense.
[2301.94s -> 2302.14s]  Wait.

[2389.68s -> 2391.08s]  That is actually really rude of me guys.
[2391.18s -> 2395.76s]  Yeah, and now you have to explain I went into Amarus chat
[2395.76s -> 2399.54s]  and I said she sucks and that she's gonna lose and she
[2399.54s -> 2401.04s]  insulted me and I thought it was funny.
[2401.78s -> 2402.98s]  How did she insult you?
[2403.42s -> 2406.32s]  She said what the fuck Russell you did not open up a spine
[2406.32s -> 2408.32s]  until this morning, which that is not true.
[2408.32s -> 2411.32s]  I don't know why she said that is true actually all week
[2411.62s -> 2413.02s]  literally what she said is true.
[2413.12s -> 2416.02s]  So I have more hours than you sure for I'm literally a higher
[2416.02s -> 2421.28s]  level than you in this game somebody's being toxic.

[2423.88s -> 2426.98s]  Wait, so who's being toxic swallow it on my own terms.
[2426.98s -> 2431.02s]  Somebody told me to calm down who's being toxic.

[2446.62s -> 2447.62s]  stepped foot in this game.
[2448.69s -> 2449.39s]  Why is that?
[2450.40s -> 2452.80s]  I just like I played today and I'm like, holy hell.

[3960.53s -> 3961.63s]  Now I understand.
[3961.73s -> 3964.63s]  We just got to stop leaving like safe areas.
[3965.03s -> 3966.63s]  Oh, that's fucking huge.
[3966.63s -> 3967.33s]  Go in, go in, go in.
[3967.33s -> 3967.93s]  That's huge.
[3967.93s -> 3969.13s]  Absolutely massive.
[3973.15s -> 3973.65s]  Big.
[3976.95s -> 3977.25s]  Get her.
[3977.25s -> 3978.05s]  Collapse, collapse, collapse.
[3978.05s -> 3978.65s]  This is huge.
[3979.35s -> 3980.45s]  We have surfer ring.
[3980.45s -> 3980.95s]  Lose it.
[3982.25s -> 3983.85s]  Therefore, this is actually so hot.
[3983.85s -> 3984.55s]  I'm not even kidding.
[3985.76s -> 3986.36s]  I think we forgot.
[3987.06s -> 3987.36s]  All right.
[3987.36s -> 3987.76s]  All right.
[3987.76s -> 3989.36s]  Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[3989.56s -> 3990.76s]  All this fucking dodgy.
[3992.54s -> 3992.84s]  All right.
[3992.84s -> 3993.24s]  That's it.
[3993.24s -> 3993.44s]  We're good.
[3993.44s -> 3993.74s]  We're good.
[3993.74s -> 3994.34s]  We pulled that back.
[3994.34s -> 3994.94s]  That was clutch.
[3995.74s -> 3996.44s]  We forgot.
[3996.54s -> 3997.14s]  Just pull it back.
[3997.14s -> 3997.74s]  Pull it back.
[3997.94s -> 3998.64s]  Can you get the dodge?
[3998.64s -> 3999.24s]  Yes.
[4003.72s -> 4006.33s]  Hey guys, we're good.
[4008.60s -> 4009.10s]  We're good.
[4010.38s -> 4011.78s]  We've gained back so much ground.
[4012.84s -> 4013.64s]  Yeah, good job.
[4014.83s -> 4015.23s]  You too.
[4015.73s -> 4017.23s]  Oh, I forgot to get the magic shell.
[4019.36s -> 4020.56s]  I pushed mid tower as well.
[4021.66s -> 4024.06s]  Our team is going to scale like crazy, by the way.
[4026.68s -> 4027.58s]  What do I do in this scenario?
[4030.42s -> 4032.12s]  I think at this point we have to just kind of be together.
[4032.92s -> 4033.22s]  Okay.
[4034.28s -> 4034.58s]  All right.
[4034.58s -> 4037.38s]  I'm going to actually wait for my Pridwin or whatever it's called.
[4037.58s -> 4038.88s]  We have to move as a unit.
[4038.98s -> 4039.38s]  I got it.
[4040.18s -> 4040.78s]  Fire giant.
[4040.78s -> 4041.58s]  Is she scary?
[4042.08s -> 4043.18s]  We could try to do Goal Fury.
[4043.18s -> 4043.88s]  Very scary.
[4043.88s -> 4044.88s]  You want to try to go?
[4044.88s -> 4045.58s]  Fire giant Baron.
[4045.58s -> 4048.38s]  I feel like we're under leveled still compared to them though.
[4048.38s -> 4049.08s]  That's kind of scary.
[4050.64s -> 4052.04s]  Yeah, I kind of want to race out of math.
[4052.04s -> 4053.24s]  They're going to push race out of math though.
[4053.24s -> 4054.24s]  They're pushing race out of math.
[4056.60s -> 4057.80s]  How many are in right right now?
[4060.60s -> 4061.90s]  We're so under leveled though.
[4062.00s -> 4063.30s]  How many are 16?
[4063.30s -> 4064.10s]  How many are 13?
[4064.30s -> 4064.70s]  Yeah.
[4064.70s -> 4066.50s]  Well, he has three kills.
[4068.31s -> 4072.21s]  We need camps though, but every time we get near camps.
[4072.21s -> 4073.41s]  They just finished Pyro.
[4074.31s -> 4074.91s]  Oh shit.
[4074.91s -> 4075.51s]  That's scary.
[4075.61s -> 4076.61s]  I'm coming over to you.
[4078.01s -> 4078.81s]  I'm just trying to get away.
[4079.51s -> 4079.91s]  Yeah.
[4079.91s -> 4080.31s]  Come to me.
[4080.31s -> 4080.61s]  Come to me.
[4080.61s -> 4084.81s]  They're all here.
[4086.69s -> 4088.39s]  What the fuck is going on on my screen?
[4091.90s -> 4092.70s]  Get me the fuck out.
[4094.00s -> 4094.20s]  Yeah.
[4094.20s -> 4094.70s]  Watch out.
[4094.70s -> 4095.10s]  She's on.
[4095.10s -> 4095.90s]  She's right in there.
[4097.60s -> 4099.00s]  Yeah, I'm just running away.
[4099.00s -> 4100.10s]  Wait, should we just push?
[4100.50s -> 4102.60s]  Yeah, I would just push the right lane.
[4105.48s -> 4105.98s]  Oh, they're coming.
[4105.98s -> 4106.88s]  Yeah, they're wrapping up.
[4108.84s -> 4110.94s]  Yeah, I think they're coming.
[4110.94s -> 4111.94s]  I'm leaving right side.
[4111.94s -> 4112.74s]  I'm leaving right side.
[4112.74s -> 4113.94s]  A lot of coming going on.
[4114.94s -> 4115.54s]  You like that?
[4115.84s -> 4116.34s]  Yeah.
[4119.54s -> 4119.74s]  All right.
[4119.74s -> 4120.14s]  You're here.
[4120.14s -> 4121.04s]  Wait, I like this guy.
[4121.04s -> 4121.74s]  Can you go check it?
[4122.14s -> 4124.04s]  Maybe you could solo farm and then I rotate.
[4124.54s -> 4126.74s]  I can't I'm so I'm dying every time.
[4130.48s -> 4132.88s]  We just all we have to do is make sure we have words on fire.
[4132.88s -> 4133.38s]  Giant.
[4133.38s -> 4134.18s]  They never do that.
[4134.28s -> 4134.88s]  We're fine.
[4135.18s -> 4136.28s]  What is God fury?
[4136.58s -> 4137.38s]  Gold fury.
[4138.08s -> 4138.68s]  It's dragon.
[4138.68s -> 4139.78s]  Basically the right thing.
[4139.78s -> 4140.28s]  What is this?
[4140.88s -> 4141.28s]  It's gone.
[4142.48s -> 4143.58s]  Let's fucking push this tower.
[4144.98s -> 4150.83s]  Okay, but one is in mid blown is the scariest of their whole team
[4150.83s -> 4151.83s]  so far in the dodgy.
[4151.93s -> 4153.87s]  Yeah, she hard.
[4154.57s -> 4155.57s]  Yeah, you guys be careful.
[4155.57s -> 4157.07s]  They're going to collapse.
[4157.07s -> 4159.07s]  Yeah, yeah, leave right away.
[4159.07s -> 4159.67s]  All right.
[4159.67s -> 4160.07s]  Cool.
[4160.17s -> 4160.97s]  Oh God, of course.
[4160.97s -> 4162.87s]  I'm the slowest one buffers up.
[4165.76s -> 4166.56s]  I'm so scared.
[4168.16s -> 4168.96s]  They in mid right now.

[4172.56s -> 4173.86s]  I have my own coming coming coming.
[4176.31s -> 4177.81s]  She's your ult on the AD carry.
[4177.81s -> 4179.61s]  What's the name Freya?
[4180.87s -> 4181.07s]  I'm ready.
[4181.07s -> 4181.47s]  I'm ready.
[4183.36s -> 4183.86s]  Go for it.
[4187.34s -> 4188.04s]  I got one.
[4189.54s -> 4190.54s]  No, I miss my own.
[4194.71s -> 4195.71s]  Don't let that dodge you get away.
[4200.25s -> 4200.85s]  Let's go.
[4200.85s -> 4201.45s]  Let's go.
[4205.76s -> 4206.46s]  I got flash.
[4210.05s -> 4210.55s]  There it is.
[4210.55s -> 4210.95s]  There it is.
[4210.95s -> 4212.65s]  And that's how you bring the goddamn game back.
[4213.95s -> 4214.65s]  Let's get gold fury.
[4214.65s -> 4215.05s]  Go fury.
[4215.05s -> 4215.55s]  Go fury.
[4215.55s -> 4216.55s]  Gold fury is gone.
[4216.65s -> 4217.15s]  Oh shit.
[4217.15s -> 4218.25s]  We can get a fire giant.
[4218.75s -> 4219.55s]  Can you think we could do it?
[4219.95s -> 4220.45s]  Should we do it?
[4221.25s -> 4222.25s]  We got to do something, right?
[4222.65s -> 4222.85s]  Yeah.
[4222.85s -> 4223.75s]  Well, yeah, let's let's go.
[4223.75s -> 4224.55s]  Let's go captain.
[4224.55s -> 4225.35s]  This is your kill.
[4225.45s -> 4226.35s]  Let's get the pyro guy.
[4227.55s -> 4228.55s]  It might be too late now.
[4228.55s -> 4229.45s]  Oh, let's push tower.
[4229.45s -> 4229.85s]  I don't know.
[4229.85s -> 4230.75s]  I don't play this game.
[4232.25s -> 4233.85s]  You have guides motherfucker.
[4235.25s -> 4236.35s]  Let's just push mid tower.
[4236.45s -> 4237.85s]  I should have definitely bought but it's fine.
[4238.85s -> 4239.55s]  I don't understand.
[4239.55s -> 4240.45s]  Oh my why?
[4241.79s -> 4242.99s]  Guys the towers.
[4245.79s -> 4246.69s]  How many how many how many?
[4246.89s -> 4247.99s]  Of course, bro.
[4247.99s -> 4250.09s]  I pull back pull back pull back pull back pull back.
[4250.19s -> 4250.89s]  No, not worth it.
[4250.89s -> 4251.29s]  They're up.
[4251.29s -> 4251.59s]  They're up.
[4251.59s -> 4251.79s]  They're up.
[4251.79s -> 4252.09s]  They're up.
[4252.89s -> 4253.49s]  They're all up.
[4253.89s -> 4255.39s]  That's her little lift ability.
[4255.99s -> 4256.29s]  Yeah.
[4256.39s -> 4259.59s]  If you got money spend it because we brought the game back.
[4260.29s -> 4261.59s]  So if you got money spend it.
[4263.11s -> 4263.71s]  Good stuff.
[4265.40s -> 4266.70s]  Why can't I upgrade my sentinels?
[4266.70s -> 4267.90s]  I wanted to be one know why.
[4270.30s -> 4271.30s]  Is it is it maxed out?
[4272.13s -> 4273.63s]  It's like what is it?
[4274.13s -> 4275.13s]  Is that your starter item?
[4275.73s -> 4277.13s]  Yeah, you got to wait till level 20.
[4278.30s -> 4278.70s]  That's that.
[4278.70s -> 4280.40s]  That's the last thing that you're going to upgrade.
[4283.04s -> 4284.84s]  Yeah, that's the last item you're going to upgrade.
[4290.36s -> 4293.06s]  We're going to scale really well here if we can keep us up.
[4294.89s -> 4295.99s]  Wait poke.
[4297.73s -> 4298.13s]  Yo.
[4299.43s -> 4299.73s]  Oh my god.
[4299.73s -> 4300.53s]  I was so close.
[4303.15s -> 4304.25s]  Are you saying right side?
[4305.45s -> 4306.35s]  Are they going for fire giant?
[4308.83s -> 4309.13s]  Let's fight it.
[4309.13s -> 4309.53s]  Let's fight it.
[4316.79s -> 4317.09s]  Good.
[4317.09s -> 4317.39s]  Good.
[4317.39s -> 4317.89s]  Good.
[4321.20s -> 4321.90s]  I see the Bologna.
[4322.00s -> 4322.40s]  I'm coming.
[4323.94s -> 4325.24s]  We can maybe fire giant.
[4325.24s -> 4325.84s]  Stop this guy.
[4325.84s -> 4326.44s]  Let's fire giant.
[4326.44s -> 4326.84s]  Let's fire giant.
[4326.84s -> 4327.54s]  Let's fire giant then.
[4327.84s -> 4329.54s]  But there's a lot of me here.
[4329.54s -> 4329.94s]  Hold on.
[4332.10s -> 4332.70s]  We need tank.
[4332.70s -> 4333.70s]  Oh boy.
[4333.70s -> 4334.20s]  We've done it.
[4334.20s -> 4334.60s]  I would go.
[4335.10s -> 4335.60s]  We're not over here.
[4335.60s -> 4336.10s]  We're not out here.
[4336.50s -> 4336.80s]  All right.
[4336.80s -> 4337.20s]  Let's get it.
[4337.20s -> 4337.80s]  Oh my god.
[4337.80s -> 4339.40s]  I'm going to die for the fucking fire giant.
[4341.71s -> 4342.31s]  I got to get out of here.
[4342.31s -> 4343.21s]  I'm going to die from fire giant.
[4343.21s -> 4343.81s]  I have to leave.
[4344.91s -> 4345.41s]  Okay.
[4346.61s -> 4347.31s]  We can we can we can.
[4348.61s -> 4350.01s]  Well, it's not that we're not strong.
[4350.01s -> 4350.71s]  It's this fire.
[4352.21s -> 4355.31s]  We need a we need a we need a tank to take that take the hits though.
[4356.81s -> 4357.21s]  I'm dumb.
[4357.21s -> 4359.91s]  Sorry, but our right side is being pushed.
[4359.91s -> 4362.81s]  So I can't yeah, I'm fucking one HP.
[4362.81s -> 4363.61s]  It's like hard.
[4364.31s -> 4366.21s]  Word beside all of you as long as I'm here.
[4366.91s -> 4367.91s]  We took the lead here.
[4369.40s -> 4370.00s]  Oh, I almost died.
[4371.61s -> 4373.01s]  No, I'm pushing right.
[4373.01s -> 4373.71s]  I'm going to come right side.
[4377.38s -> 4379.18s]  They're all they might be thinking to do fire.
[4380.69s -> 4381.59s]  I'll be there in a second.
[4382.76s -> 4384.76s]  Yeah, they have balona to right side.
[4384.76s -> 4385.96s]  So they are going to take it.
[4386.36s -> 4386.96s]  Yeah, they're taking it.
[4386.96s -> 4387.36s]  They're taking it.
[4387.36s -> 4388.26s]  Yeah, go go go.
[4388.26s -> 4388.56s]  Let's go.
[4388.56s -> 4391.26s]  Me and you know, they're doing the fireman sir guy.
[4391.26s -> 4392.16s]  Oh, they're doing the fireman sir.
[4392.76s -> 4393.66s]  Oh, I shouldn't help you.
[4395.16s -> 4395.56s]  Oh, they're doing.
[4395.56s -> 4396.46s]  Yeah, you see it now.
[4396.66s -> 4397.16s]  I'm gonna go by.
[4398.16s -> 4398.56s]  We have them.
[4398.56s -> 4399.46s]  What do we do about that?
[4401.36s -> 4401.86s]  No, we're not.
[4403.06s -> 4404.96s]  We probably 2020 hindsight.
[4405.06s -> 4405.86s]  Yeah, let's get it over.
[4406.56s -> 4408.26s]  We probably should have killed the fireman sir.
[4408.86s -> 4409.86s]  2020 hindsight there.
[4411.77s -> 4413.17s]  Gailing hard right now to push right side.
[4414.96s -> 4415.76s]  Still have no gold.
[4415.76s -> 4416.06s]  How?
[4418.16s -> 4418.66s]  They're right here.
[4419.16s -> 4419.76s]  Watch mid.
[4420.26s -> 4420.96s]  I'm with you brother.
[4420.96s -> 4421.26s]  Yeah.
[4423.01s -> 4423.91s]  I think they got two or three here.
[4423.91s -> 4424.51s]  Yeah, watch it.
[4424.71s -> 4425.11s]  Yeah.
[4425.11s -> 4425.81s]  Let's back off.
[4426.01s -> 4427.51s]  Well, I'm full build right now.
[4428.48s -> 4430.28s]  They're all in this right side here.
[4430.88s -> 4432.28s]  I wish I had a ward to be honest.
[4432.28s -> 4433.48s]  I'm nowhere close to my full build.
[4434.42s -> 4435.82s]  Well, if we there's a power site.
[4437.20s -> 4438.20s]  It'd be now for me.
[4438.20s -> 4439.60s]  It was Primal Fury thing.
[4439.60s -> 4440.50s]  Wait, wait, you're no, no, no.
[4440.50s -> 4442.00s]  There were people literally just seen over here.
[4442.00s -> 4443.40s]  I think they they're gonna do fire.
[4443.40s -> 4444.30s]  We could fuck with this.
[4444.78s -> 4445.98s]  I think they're doing it right now.
[4446.48s -> 4446.88s]  Let's go.
[4446.88s -> 4447.48s]  Let's let's fuck with it.
[4447.48s -> 4447.88s]  I'm coming.
[4448.58s -> 4450.18s]  I'm just I'm just gonna go in there and just just I'm just
[4450.18s -> 4451.18s]  gonna just kind of cause it.
[4451.28s -> 4452.08s]  I'm behind poke.
[4452.28s -> 4453.18s]  Okay, it's already dead.
[4453.18s -> 4453.68s]  It's dead.
[4453.68s -> 4454.38s]  Shit.
[4454.38s -> 4456.18s]  Primal Fury then can we kill the Primal Fury?
[4457.28s -> 4458.68s]  They're coming in real hard.
[4459.18s -> 4460.08s]  I'm coming coming coming.
[4460.18s -> 4462.38s]  We have to play very defensive.
[4462.38s -> 4464.08s]  We have to play very defensive.
[4464.08s -> 4466.38s]  Watch out, we need to form poke, form poke.
[4466.38s -> 4467.18s]  I got to leave you.
[4468.28s -> 4468.98s]  I just got fucking.
[4470.18s -> 4470.58s]  Shit.
[4471.08s -> 4472.08s]  Oh, I just flashed into it.
[4474.08s -> 4475.28s]  I thought they were on the other side.
[4475.28s -> 4475.88s]  Oh no.
[4475.98s -> 4477.78s]  Oh, that was fucking big.
[4477.78s -> 4479.18s]  That was actually huge.
[4484.50s -> 4485.60s]  Oh, damn it.
[4486.50s -> 4488.40s]  No, no, they're all they're all low.
[4488.40s -> 4489.30s]  I saw.
[4490.30s -> 4492.30s]  They can't push because I'm alive.
[4492.30s -> 4494.16s]  But okay.
[4495.23s -> 4496.53s]  I think they're doing gold period.
[4496.53s -> 4497.23s]  I just want you.
[4497.23s -> 4501.13s]  I'm trying to feed you sure for like you already full build.
[4501.13s -> 4501.63s]  There's no more.
[4503.63s -> 4504.33s]  I'm off.
[4505.16s -> 4506.36s]  I feel like I don't do damage.
[4506.36s -> 4507.46s]  I should have just pulled back.
[4508.46s -> 4509.76s]  My nerves are too high.
[4510.26s -> 4510.76s]  It's okay.
[4510.76s -> 4511.26s]  It's okay.
[4512.76s -> 4513.26s]  Right.
[4514.46s -> 4516.96s]  And then all right, we we got to start winning team fights.
[4517.56s -> 4520.96s]  That's the only way well, we've won every single team fight so
[4520.96s -> 4521.56s]  far.
[4521.56s -> 4523.46s]  Yeah from from the this part going forward.
[4530.45s -> 4532.75s]  I'm just going to stay next to you sure for to be honest.
[4532.95s -> 4533.45s]  I'm honest.
[4533.45s -> 4537.32s]  I can also like solo push left hard, but I don't TP.
[4537.32s -> 4539.12s]  I'm going to let you solo push right side.
[4539.12s -> 4541.12s]  Maybe so you can get this book right here.
[4541.72s -> 4542.42s]  Whoa.
[4542.42s -> 4543.02s]  Why wouldn't do that?
[4543.02s -> 4543.82s]  Oh wait that buff.
[4543.82s -> 4544.12s]  Okay.
[4544.52s -> 4547.42s]  Well phrase somewhere near just saying so watch out but I am
[4547.42s -> 4548.52s]  like kind of hidden back here.
[4549.22s -> 4550.52s]  When does their fire giant run out?
[4551.75s -> 4554.45s]  It's like four minutes, but they have it.
[4554.45s -> 4555.35s]  It's a long time.
[4556.42s -> 4558.22s]  I mean, they haven't gotten anything from it yet.
[4558.22s -> 4559.42s]  Make sure you're buying wards.
[4559.42s -> 4560.32s]  Give extra gold.
[4561.62s -> 4562.52s]  There are two right side.
[4562.92s -> 4563.32s]  They're getting me.
[4563.32s -> 4563.82s]  They're getting me.
[4564.32s -> 4566.02s]  Yeah, I'm getting ganked brother.
[4566.32s -> 4573.14s]  It's a tower to the other else down.
[4574.43s -> 4576.13s]  They were in the fucking jungle.
[4576.33s -> 4577.63s]  They used to be caught out.
[4579.28s -> 4579.68s]  Now shit.
[4579.68s -> 4580.08s]  They're all here.
[4580.08s -> 4582.58s]  Yeah, they're all pushing me hard.
[4584.99s -> 4587.49s]  They can't really push if I'm at the tower.
[4590.44s -> 4593.64s]  I'm going to try to push mid and just like yeah, we have I'm
[4593.64s -> 4595.24s]  not sure what the what the play here is.
[4596.25s -> 4598.15s]  We just have to wait until they mess up really.
[4599.34s -> 4600.34s]  Damn, you do so much damage.
[4600.34s -> 4600.74s]  It's done.
[4600.74s -> 4601.34s]  You have a stun.
[4603.50s -> 4604.20s]  It's like it's 20.
[4604.70s -> 4606.10s]  Yeah, I can board bottom left.
[4606.10s -> 4606.50s]  Bottom left.
[4606.50s -> 4608.10s]  If I board, you want to kill?
[4608.90s -> 4609.60s]  There we go.
[4609.80s -> 4610.60s]  No, there's three though.
[4610.60s -> 4611.20s]  There's three.
[4611.30s -> 4614.16s]  I'm going left side.
[4614.26s -> 4615.26s]  I can fight the Deja.
[4615.96s -> 4617.66s]  I'm going to wait in the jungle because she's probably going
[4617.66s -> 4618.16s]  to dash through.
[4618.16s -> 4626.93s]  I'm going to fuck with him guys.
[4626.93s -> 4630.23s]  I'm trying to get out my ults up and I flash my ults up and
[4630.23s -> 4630.73s]  I flash.
[4630.73s -> 4631.63s]  I didn't know the command.
[4631.83s -> 4632.73s]  I can help you guys.
[4633.33s -> 4635.23s]  I thought she was going to dash in the jungle to get away.
[4635.23s -> 4636.13s]  Turn when I'm there.
[4636.23s -> 4637.63s]  I got her there already gone.
[4638.81s -> 4640.51s]  I thought that she was going to jump into the jungle to get
[4640.51s -> 4643.17s]  away from you, but I killed her though.
[4644.01s -> 4644.21s]  Okay.
[4644.21s -> 4644.41s]  Good.
[4644.41s -> 4644.61s]  Good.
[4644.61s -> 4644.91s]  Good.
[4650.23s -> 4651.53s]  I was waiting for the escape.
[4651.53s -> 4652.43s]  Xp camp up.
[4653.91s -> 4654.61s]  Everybody at 20.
[4655.41s -> 4655.91s]  Sweetie.
[4657.21s -> 4660.19s]  Poke near me and they're doing the obelisk shit too.
[4660.39s -> 4660.89s]  Damn it.
[4662.08s -> 4665.75s]  They just got objectives right now like hard.
[4665.85s -> 4667.75s]  Yeah, we need we need to do objectives.
[4667.85s -> 4669.05s]  I think we got to kind of group.
[4669.05s -> 4670.15s]  We got to group up at this point.
[4670.15s -> 4673.15s]  Yeah, I think we are ready for a team fight.
[4673.45s -> 4679.68s]  I think we actually have to like you're so fast.
[4680.08s -> 4681.18s]  I know speed buff.
[4683.84s -> 4686.04s]  I'm kind of scared to go with you because if I go with you
[4686.04s -> 4689.04s]  then I can't leave you like I can get out and I can't they
[4689.04s -> 4690.94s]  doing as if it's fire giant back up, but they're not they're
[4690.94s -> 4691.64s]  not doing that again.
[4691.64s -> 4692.04s]  Are they?
[4692.14s -> 4693.44s]  No, it's not up yet.
[4694.04s -> 4696.24s]  I mean you can wait for one more item for my powerslake
[4696.24s -> 4697.64s]  and then I get a buff right side.
[4698.34s -> 4700.04s]  Yeah, I got to complete my last item.
[4701.44s -> 4703.04s]  What my buff right side might get killed here.
[4705.74s -> 4706.74s]  I'm just going to push left.
[4708.67s -> 4709.27s]  It's dead.
[4709.37s -> 4709.87s]  Nevermind.
[4711.70s -> 4712.80s]  We can hear the sadness.
[4715.55s -> 4716.35s]  How long does last?
[4717.15s -> 4717.55s]  Okay.
[4717.85s -> 4719.95s]  Well, it's their fire buff has been gone.
[4720.15s -> 4722.25s]  Yeah, I'm so scared to sit inside jungle.
[4722.25s -> 4724.92s]  So I'm just going to chill come push with me.
[4725.52s -> 4725.92s]  Okay.
[4726.32s -> 4728.12s]  Well right now they're just waiting to gank.
[4728.72s -> 4730.52s]  Yeah, I was going to say that's why I feel like we shouldn't
[4730.52s -> 4732.52s]  push Freya was left side right there.
[4732.82s -> 4736.02s]  So yeah, they're doing the pyromancer.
[4736.22s -> 4737.32s]  Oh fuck.
[4737.32s -> 4741.45s]  I don't know if Giants up or not because we don't have a ward.
[4741.95s -> 4742.65s]  They're all on left side.
[4742.65s -> 4754.92s]  I think you notice it's I don't know the timing.
[4754.92s -> 4758.36s]  So when these objectives are up usually that if you as long
[4758.36s -> 4761.46s]  as you have a word your vision on them, you can see I think
[4761.46s -> 4761.96s]  I was muted.
[4761.96s -> 4762.46s]  Sorry.
[4763.06s -> 4763.66s]  It's fine.
[4764.46s -> 4765.46s]  They're all probably just right here.
[4768.76s -> 4770.66s]  I think we have to go in we have to we have to we have to go
[4770.66s -> 4771.56s]  in going to go in here.
[4778.12s -> 4779.52s]  This is a big deal if we can get this.
[4781.12s -> 4782.02s]  This is a huge deal.
[4783.22s -> 4783.92s]  Oh boy.
[4783.92s -> 4784.32s]  All right.
[4784.32s -> 4784.72s]  That's big.
[4784.72s -> 4785.32s]  That's a big deal.
[4785.32s -> 4785.82s]  Big deal.
[4790.51s -> 4792.51s]  Did we they won't be able to finish fire.
[4792.51s -> 4793.31s]  They can't get fire.
[4793.31s -> 4793.81s]  That's right.
[4795.36s -> 4796.76s]  So that was a 45.
[4796.76s -> 4797.46s]  So it's fine.
[4798.79s -> 4799.69s]  I'm almost full build.
[4801.53s -> 4807.50s]  I sell dust hole and I make invent and venom or something.
[4811.34s -> 4811.74s]  Oh no.
[4811.74s -> 4812.24s]  Oh shit.
[4812.24s -> 4814.24s]  I have to yeah, I have to upgrade my last title.
[4814.94s -> 4815.74s]  You can upgrade it.
[4817.00s -> 4818.10s]  Defend left side Phoenix.
[4818.10s -> 4819.10s]  They're trying to push Phoenix.
[4819.40s -> 4819.80s]  Got it.
[4820.89s -> 4822.29s]  Yeah, that that's the last item you upgrade.
[4822.59s -> 4823.39s]  What's happening in the races?
[4823.69s -> 4824.69s]  Should I do nothing about it?
[4827.04s -> 4827.94s]  I mean, that's a catapult.
[4827.94s -> 4829.04s]  We just have to deal with that later.
[4829.14s -> 4832.50s]  Okay, it destroys their towers.
[4832.50s -> 4835.26s]  But I'll be full.
[4835.26s -> 4840.89s]  They're they're trying to like she use her all.
[4843.06s -> 4845.36s]  She's waiting for the item real quick thing.
[4845.96s -> 4847.96s]  Yeah, I'm waiting 10 seconds or so.
[4848.26s -> 4849.86s]  Was that her all which I push right?
[4849.86s -> 4850.76s]  I push right side alone.
[4850.76s -> 4851.26s]  Should I push right?
[4851.26s -> 4851.96s]  I'm on a pillar.
[4851.96s -> 4852.56s]  That's her all.
[4852.66s -> 4855.56s]  Yeah, head right side because we get they're gonna they're all
[4855.56s -> 4856.26s]  in the left side.
[4862.37s -> 4864.67s]  Hi, four, three, two, one.
[4864.67s -> 4865.07s]  Come on.
[4867.22s -> 4867.62s]  Come on.
[4868.02s -> 4869.42s]  Wait, I'll come right side.
[4869.42s -> 4869.92s]  I guess.
[4870.82s -> 4873.22s]  Are there any objectives up that we need to worry about?
[4873.62s -> 4875.02s]  We could try gold fire.
[4875.42s -> 4876.52s]  Go furious.
[4876.52s -> 4877.02s]  Go furious.
[4877.02s -> 4878.12s]  Not even worth doing right now.
[4878.12s -> 4879.02s]  Everyone's pretty much full.
[4879.72s -> 4881.52s]  Well, every fight is going to be around the left side of the
[4881.52s -> 4882.02s]  map right now.
[4882.02s -> 4882.32s]  Okay.
[4883.86s -> 4886.46s]  We just need more than we should just push out.
[4886.46s -> 4888.76s]  We should push out right side a little bit and then just maybe
[4888.76s -> 4889.76s]  everybody control left.
[4890.36s -> 4893.86s]  I'm gonna go to base real quick and get my my Invenom shit.
[4894.06s -> 4895.16s]  Yeah, I need to eat some stuff.
[4897.08s -> 4897.58s]  Who's that?
[4903.60s -> 4904.40s]  They're on the mid.
[4905.99s -> 4907.69s]  Freya and someone else actually Freya just went left side
[4907.69s -> 4909.09s]  camp or left side jungle.
[4909.09s -> 4909.59s]  You need to go left side.
[4909.59s -> 4909.79s]  Careful.
[4909.79s -> 4910.09s]  Careful.
[4910.09s -> 4910.69s]  Whoever's left.
[4911.79s -> 4912.09s]  I'm out.
[4912.09s -> 4912.49s]  I'm out.
[4916.63s -> 4919.63s]  Could they be on the anything on the left side of the map?
[4920.73s -> 4921.33s]  No, right?
[4922.73s -> 4923.53s]  To giant.
[4927.08s -> 4928.88s]  We need to get close to giant so I can put a ward.
[4928.88s -> 4929.78s]  Oh, they're doing it right now.
[4931.68s -> 4932.08s]  Shit.
[4936.08s -> 4936.48s]  Shit.
[4937.48s -> 4938.68s]  I thought I could put a trap and run.
[4938.68s -> 4939.08s]  Oh my God.
[4939.08s -> 4939.88s]  I'm stupid.
[4940.58s -> 4941.28s]  Oh God.
[4941.38s -> 4941.98s]  They're coming.
[4942.48s -> 4943.38s]  They're coming.
[4943.38s -> 4944.08s]  Play the towers.
[4944.08s -> 4944.58s]  Play the tower.
[4944.58s -> 4946.08s]  Yeah, I just stay in tower.
[4946.18s -> 4947.08s]  What one shot me.
[4947.18s -> 4947.78s]  Oh my God.
[4948.18s -> 4949.68s]  You got pulled in by her ult.
[4949.98s -> 4950.58s]  I'd be pretty strong.
[4950.58s -> 4951.58s]  I'm pretty we're pretty strong.
[4951.58s -> 4953.78s]  They can't like if they push I'm just going to all because I
[4953.78s -> 4956.48s]  can just they have to tower dive against me or else they
[4956.48s -> 4958.48s]  can't really push that for a minute.
[4959.38s -> 4959.68s]  Yep.
[4959.68s -> 4960.18s]  Oh my God.
[4960.18s -> 4961.48s]  It's a long countdown.
[4965.47s -> 4967.97s]  I got a track and then suck them in.
[4967.97s -> 4968.47s]  I'll be honest.
[4968.47s -> 4970.17s]  You could you could do it.
[4970.17s -> 4971.17s]  You got a good one.
[4971.47s -> 4972.97s]  We don't need to force a fight that fire giant.
[4972.97s -> 4974.77s]  No, but if I suck them under the tower, that's easy.
[4974.77s -> 4978.72s]  When like we just know if they want to push they're all going
[4978.72s -> 4979.42s]  to have beads.
[4979.42s -> 4981.02s]  I'm imagining they're probably all going to use it.
[4981.42s -> 4981.62s]  Yeah.
[4981.62s -> 4982.92s]  Left side of the map seen pushed.
[4984.08s -> 4985.18s]  Yeah, they're going to split push.
[4987.38s -> 4989.38s]  I need to eat some more minions for them.
[4991.70s -> 4993.50s]  I need to eat some minions.
[4999.76s -> 5000.16s]  All right.
[5000.56s -> 5003.36s]  Left is pretty empty for mid right now.
[5003.36s -> 5003.76s]  Yeah.
[5004.93s -> 5005.63s]  Going back mid.
[5011.82s -> 5013.22s]  We should know how long their buff is.
[5020.21s -> 5021.21s]  I don't see anybody over here.
[5022.43s -> 5024.33s]  Are they still for in mid where they went?
[5025.10s -> 5026.70s]  They're probably just serious.
[5027.90s -> 5029.30s]  Yeah, only fury.
[5030.50s -> 5031.90s]  Are they going to get kill fury?
[5032.50s -> 5032.90s]  All right.
[5034.36s -> 5034.56s]  All right.
[5034.56s -> 5036.46s]  Now we got a we got to think about making a move here.
[5038.28s -> 5042.08s]  Well, this is whatever it is to just wait until it's off.
[5042.58s -> 5043.68s]  Yep, they're going right side.
[5044.08s -> 5045.78s]  We can we hyper push left.
[5048.49s -> 5050.09s]  Yeah, we could try.
[5050.09s -> 5051.39s]  You could try to get tower and left.
[5052.68s -> 5053.98s]  How many are they all in right side?
[5054.68s -> 5055.58s]  Yeah, they're all right.
[5055.68s -> 5057.78s]  Push push push left if you just hold it.
[5059.38s -> 5060.78s]  Yeah, I think they're going for a win here.
[5060.88s -> 5061.48s]  They're going for win.
[5061.78s -> 5062.88s]  They're going to try to end the game.
[5065.95s -> 5066.15s]  Okay.
[5066.15s -> 5066.55s]  I'm dead.
[5067.15s -> 5068.75s]  Yeah, they're trying to end the game right now.
[5074.62s -> 5075.82s]  That's that's very old down.
[5081.84s -> 5082.74s]  I was just terrified.
[5082.74s -> 5083.94s]  I just fucking press that button.
[5085.40s -> 5088.54s]  My god, they're doing a lot of damage.
[5088.64s -> 5089.84s]  They bet they got it back up though.
[5089.94s -> 5090.44s]  They're backing.
[5101.75s -> 5102.45s]  I'm pushing this.
[5103.15s -> 5103.75s]  Oh God.
[5104.25s -> 5104.75s]  Oh no.
[5108.53s -> 5109.33s]  Oh, he can do that.
[5109.33s -> 5110.03s]  Oh God.
[5111.23s -> 5112.23s]  Oh guys.
[5117.04s -> 5118.34s]  Wow, they can just tower dive.
[5120.33s -> 5122.43s]  They didn't necessarily tower dive.
[5123.69s -> 5124.29s]  Yikes.
[5124.49s -> 5126.09s]  I'm up in six seconds.
[5126.69s -> 5127.19s]  Oh fuck.
[5127.19s -> 5127.69s]  I'm dead.
[5127.89s -> 5128.59s]  I think this is it.
[5129.39s -> 5130.19s]  I think this is it.
[5130.39s -> 5131.59s]  Yeah, that's a guess for our game.
[5133.39s -> 5134.69s]  We'll see if I can clutch out or not.
[5134.69s -> 5135.99s]  Hey, hey, hey, listen, listen.
[5136.59s -> 5138.49s]  This was this was the team.
[5139.39s -> 5140.69s]  This was the team to beat by the way.
[5140.89s -> 5142.19s]  That's what we've been told.
[5143.27s -> 5144.57s]  So this was the team.
[5144.87s -> 5147.17s]  No, he didn't say this was the team to beat.
[5147.27s -> 5150.57s]  Oh, he said it was one of the strongest ones.
[5150.67s -> 5156.06s]  Oh, I use my beads, but like it didn't work.
[5156.06s -> 5157.36s]  It didn't get me out of the swirly.
[5158.33s -> 5162.13s]  I use species you can't get out of.
[5162.13s -> 5166.76s]  I'm pretty sure I genuinely think my biggest problem is knowing
[5166.76s -> 5167.46s]  positioning.
[5167.46s -> 5169.46s]  I got caught out so many times early game.
[5170.46s -> 5172.06s]  I think we did our warm-up game.
[5172.06s -> 5172.96s]  I think we did good though.
[5173.26s -> 5173.96s]  I mean, come on.
[5173.96s -> 5175.66s]  Wait, I think that was a good.
[5175.66s -> 5176.66s]  I think that was a good show.
[5177.16s -> 5178.06s]  I think it was a good showing.
[5179.80s -> 5181.00s]  We lost the wands up, dude.
[5181.70s -> 5182.50s]  Yes, you did.
[5182.50s -> 5184.60s]  You did better than I thought you would have to that start.
[5184.80s -> 5187.40s]  I get kind of shit on but it's all right.
[5188.44s -> 5190.64s]  You guys got to I know it's hard the beat none of you are
[5190.64s -> 5192.44s]  beadsing like you use your beads.
[5192.44s -> 5193.84s]  So you don't get CC.
[5194.04s -> 5195.14s]  So like what is beads?
[5195.54s -> 5196.04s]  That's right.
[5197.84s -> 5200.94s]  Yeah, you use those do before you get CC.
[5200.94s -> 5203.24s]  So like that dude would go up on the bottom thing and change
[5203.24s -> 5203.34s]  you.
[5203.34s -> 5205.64s]  That's when you would beat so he wouldn't pull you look at
[5205.64s -> 5206.84s]  your first player damage.
[5208.14s -> 5208.94s]  How much damage did I do?
[5208.94s -> 5209.54s]  I do a lot.
[5209.74s -> 5210.64s]  I did nothing.
[5211.04s -> 5213.54s]  I needed to do more to show up to practice last night.
[5213.54s -> 5214.14s]  We would have won.
[5214.44s -> 5220.14s]  We had a we had a team practice yesterday and we could have
[5220.14s -> 5221.14s]  been on the same thing.
[5221.14s -> 5221.64s]  No, I'm just kidding.
[5221.94s -> 5224.76s]  Nobody told me dude.
[5225.36s -> 5228.66s]  I didn't know you guys were looking at the OTK shows chat.
[5228.66s -> 5232.46s]  Okay, I would have expected to DM me on Twitter be like,
[5232.46s -> 5234.36s]  yo, dude, we're practicing right now.
[5234.56s -> 5235.56s]  I'm like, oh shoot.
[5235.66s -> 5236.26s]  Let's go crack.
[5236.66s -> 5239.16s]  Do you guys have pings disabled on discord?
[5239.26s -> 5241.56s]  Yeah, I have everything disabled on this rely on the most
[5241.56s -> 5242.76s]  lazy guy on the team.
[5244.76s -> 5246.16s]  Yeah, you know me.
[5247.06s -> 5250.68s]  Yeah, I think that that would we did good though.
[5250.78s -> 5252.48s]  That was a good that was a good showing.
[5252.48s -> 5253.98s]  You guys are we're not doing that.
[5253.98s -> 5255.28s]  Your next game should be easier.
[5255.38s -> 5255.78s]  You need to win.
[5255.78s -> 5258.78s]  I agree and your last game is going to be your you guys need
[5258.78s -> 5259.58s]  to step up again.
[5259.68s -> 5259.98s]  All right.
[5261.66s -> 5265.06s]  Well, yeah started early like the start of the game Russell
[5265.06s -> 5265.96s]  takes the green book.
[5266.86s -> 5271.46s]  Yeah, I know and then I'll be more aggressive in lane.
[5271.96s -> 5274.06s]  Yeah, you need to start your three Russell.
[5274.06s -> 5275.16s]  What's my first item?
[5275.26s -> 5283.06s]  I should start my three three pots or you all potions.
[5283.06s -> 5286.46s]  Yeah, that's all you need is potion and then transcendence.
[5286.46s -> 5286.96s]  You'll finish.
[5286.96s -> 5290.06s]  It's a morning star is the tier one item, but you'll go transcendence.
[5290.06s -> 5290.86s]  I'll type it out again.
[5290.86s -> 5291.96s]  Like no, no, I see.
[5291.96s -> 5292.96s]  Very cool.
[5293.66s -> 5294.96s]  Yeah, then I get transcendence.
[5295.16s -> 5298.00s]  Yes, or whatever item that you had.
[5298.00s -> 5300.30s]  Yeah, I can see you guys again.
[5301.11s -> 5305.38s]  We tried we tried but I needed that warm up though.
[5306.12s -> 5306.92s]  They were good team.
[5307.46s -> 5308.06s]  We got to be more.
[5308.06s -> 5310.06s]  We got to be better about trying to get the objectives to those
[5310.06s -> 5311.16s]  just like a fire giant.
[5311.66s -> 5315.59s]  Fuck that was fun.
[5315.59s -> 5316.49s]  This games fun.
[5316.79s -> 5317.99s]  I just got to be better at it.
[5324.04s -> 5325.14s]  We pulled that back.
[5325.44s -> 5328.68s]  I'm very proud of this team then you can start fucking around.
[5328.98s -> 5329.48s]  Oh, okay.
[5329.48s -> 5329.88s]  Okay.
[5330.18s -> 5330.58s]  Got it.
[5331.41s -> 5332.51s]  I'll have a phone call my mom.
[5333.57s -> 5334.37s]  Yeah, you got to answer.
[5334.97s -> 5335.57s]  Hi mom.
[5343.47s -> 5344.67s]  Am I going to play Anubis?
[5345.07s -> 5345.37s]  No.
[5348.32s -> 5350.32s]  Yeah, I think I'm going to stick to Aries.
[5350.52s -> 5354.18s]  I think that's that's the play if we don't think I'm going to
[5354.18s -> 5355.18s]  learn anything else.
[5360.12s -> 5364.82s]  I retyped out your all's both you and folks will build in that
[5364.82s -> 5365.22s]  order.
[5372.53s -> 5372.93s]  Got it.
[5373.62s -> 5379.17s]  So the next game we're going against is it Emerus team?
[5379.47s -> 5381.05s]  I believe so.
[5383.04s -> 5384.84s]  I don't know what their full thing is.
[5385.04s -> 5386.54s]  Are there bands in the finals?
[5386.64s -> 5387.14s]  Yes.
[5387.84s -> 5389.44s]  Oh, no.
[5392.64s -> 5394.64s]  So you're telling me if they banned my champion.
[5394.64s -> 5395.84s]  I have to learn a whole new one.
[5396.44s -> 5396.84s]  Yeah.
[5397.24s -> 5398.64s]  Well, we have to get to the finals first.
[5399.14s -> 5401.64s]  That is going to get but we are going to get to the finals.
[5401.64s -> 5403.04s]  I think we're going to get to the finals.
[5404.04s -> 5405.64s]  Which mid do you think I should play?
[5408.14s -> 5410.74s]  I mean you had like 50,000 player damage.
[5411.34s -> 5411.64s]  Yeah.
[5411.64s -> 5413.04s]  No, you should definitely do whatever you did.
[5413.04s -> 5413.64s]  Do that again.
[5413.74s -> 5414.94s]  You were your own team.
[5415.34s -> 5417.74s]  I was wondering if there's something that has before pressure.
[5418.14s -> 5420.24s]  No, you was you were doing was like a perfect and I don't think
[5420.24s -> 5421.24s]  hair would be any different.
[5421.84s -> 5423.74s]  You guys should have won the game when you killed everybody
[5423.74s -> 5424.84s]  and Russell wasn't right.
[5425.54s -> 5426.74s]  Sorry Russell, but you fucked him.
[5427.44s -> 5427.64s]  Oh, yeah.
[5427.64s -> 5429.24s]  When we got fired there.
[5429.54s -> 5430.64s]  Yeah, when the game of it.
[5431.04s -> 5432.24s]  Yeah, what happened?
[5432.44s -> 5434.84s]  When you were in right and they want to fight you want to do
[5434.84s -> 5437.54s]  fire you need you're like your character is be in front of
[5437.54s -> 5440.24s]  everybody start every fight be at every fight never be by
[5440.24s -> 5440.74s]  yourself.
[5440.84s -> 5441.14s]  Yeah.
[5441.64s -> 5442.14s]  All right.
[5442.24s -> 5444.84s]  That is good to know that is very good to know you should
[5444.84s -> 5445.54s]  die first.
[5445.54s -> 5446.44s]  You should be like the first one.
[5446.44s -> 5447.54s]  Here you can play that.
[5447.54s -> 5450.04s]  He has to like stay behind everybody and do not try to do
[5450.04s -> 5450.74s]  the fire dragon.
[5451.74s -> 5454.04s]  I don't want to play any other character Ares is definitely
[5454.04s -> 5454.44s]  the one.
[5456.01s -> 5456.81s]  Trust trust.
[5456.81s -> 5458.51s]  There's going to be a character he could play that he does
[5458.51s -> 5459.21s]  nothing on.
[5459.21s -> 5460.61s]  No, no, no, no on Ares.
[5460.61s -> 5463.71s]  If you start your three instead of your one, he'll do what
[5463.71s -> 5464.91s]  you want to do in lane.
[5466.91s -> 5470.11s]  I mean we can trade lanes to can I 80 carry in the lane and
[5470.11s -> 5472.61s]  work with no, we're fine.
[5472.61s -> 5473.41s]  We just fucked up early.
[5473.41s -> 5476.21s]  We got oh, I mean if I'm being completely honest by Artemis
[5476.21s -> 5477.11s]  fucking sucked.
[5477.11s -> 5479.21s]  Okay, look at the damage and it's true.
[5479.31s -> 5481.21s]  Yeah, because I had no one to fucking support me.
[5483.71s -> 5484.81s]  Oh, maybe we should change.
[5484.81s -> 5485.41s]  Maybe we should do.
[5485.41s -> 5487.91s]  I mean, this is support my fucking finger in your ass.
[5488.01s -> 5490.91s]  You guys you guys are at each other's throats.
[5493.75s -> 5495.15s]  Really like it.
[5495.35s -> 5497.75s]  This is nothing compared to what some apex players say to
[5497.75s -> 5498.25s]  each other.
[5501.92s -> 5504.42s]  Make sure you guys have cool avatars too, because that's
[5504.42s -> 5504.92s]  important.
[5505.52s -> 5505.82s]  Sure.
[5505.82s -> 5506.72s]  I had the skin buff.
[5508.98s -> 5509.98s]  I played this game.
[5510.97s -> 5512.87s]  Didn't you didn't you not like Uler?
[5512.87s -> 5515.47s]  I feel like you were saying I don't like I just didn't like
[5515.47s -> 5516.27s]  the third guy.
[5516.27s -> 5517.27s]  I played the ninja character.
[5517.37s -> 5517.87s]  Okay.
[5519.07s -> 5521.90s]  Yeah, I get a fresh start.
[5523.02s -> 5524.02s]  I think Uler is too hard.
[5524.02s -> 5524.82s]  No, he's not.
[5525.84s -> 5526.54s]  He's not hard.
[5528.53s -> 5529.13s]  Just was born.
[5529.13s -> 5531.23s]  I mean great on Artemis too.
[5531.23s -> 5534.13s]  Like you guys made a lot of plays very good job.
[5535.03s -> 5537.73s]  Your early game screwed you like really really hard.
[5537.73s -> 5539.73s]  I just think I wasn't impactful enough to be honest.
[5539.93s -> 5542.03s]  Well, yeah, you have had your first game.
[5542.13s -> 5544.53s]  So and that's also how it all works.
[5544.53s -> 5545.93s]  You're on an island for the most part.
[5545.93s -> 5547.73s]  Did I get an F on my report card weekend?
[5548.13s -> 5551.23s]  So pretty much I should just farm like a like a D.
[5552.23s -> 5555.33s]  Yeah, I miss some of your plays.
[5555.33s -> 5556.23s]  So you did some stuff, right?
[5556.23s -> 5558.83s]  Like when you guys traded you and no code kill the guy in left
[5558.83s -> 5559.23s]  and no good.
[5559.23s -> 5559.83s]  That's fine.
[5559.83s -> 5560.53s]  Like you have fires.
[5560.53s -> 5561.03s]  That was good.
[5561.03s -> 5561.43s]  Okay.
[5562.73s -> 5566.43s]  So we basically see doing is trying to alpha your laner
[5566.63s -> 5569.23s]  and if you've ever out of them you steal all the camps around
[5569.23s -> 5573.73s]  you like the other thing poke if you play Artemis your ultimate
[5573.73s -> 5574.73s]  is the same as beats.
[5574.73s -> 5576.13s]  They can't CC you or anything.
[5576.33s -> 5578.13s]  So yeah, I realize that too late.
[5578.23s -> 5580.33s]  Yeah, you could just all same for you.
[5580.83s -> 5582.63s]  Your alts will make you CC immune.
[5582.73s -> 5583.13s]  Really?
[5583.13s -> 5585.73s]  I didn't know that you could just all and then it'll help you
[5585.73s -> 5590.53s]  get away to your to make you move faster and you attack faster.
[5590.83s -> 5592.53s]  Doesn't remove slows and shit or not.
[5592.53s -> 5593.83s]  My yeah, my room is also.
[5594.93s -> 5598.63s]  It shouldn't matter once if you're all thing in that anyway,
[5598.63s -> 5600.73s]  it'll just you'll be CC immune everything.
[5603.39s -> 5605.79s]  Lenses slows and becomes immune to slows.
[5607.09s -> 5609.99s]  Yeah, when you want to do fire to you for could have done it.
[5610.09s -> 5611.89s]  You just needed whoever was healthiest to pull it.
[5613.42s -> 5615.12s]  It's pulling better the most.
[5617.42s -> 5617.62s]  All right.

[5623.02s -> 5624.12s]  I did pull it right.
[5624.42s -> 5626.02s]  I think you guys reset it.
[5626.02s -> 5627.12s]  I was going to be first.
[5627.42s -> 5629.62s]  If you guys are like not sure just do whatever is up like
[5629.62s -> 5632.42s]  if that pyromancer is up do that instead or do gold just
[5632.42s -> 5633.22s]  do something.
[5633.22s -> 5634.62s]  It doesn't matter what you're doing as long as you're doing
[5634.62s -> 5634.92s]  something.

[5648.80s -> 5651.30s]  to apply that knowledge to this game same.
[5652.83s -> 5655.73s]  I feel like sure for I'm just going to why I'm going to get
[5655.73s -> 5656.33s]  super strong.
[5656.43s -> 5657.03s]  Why is that?

[5673.72s -> 5675.62s]  No, go and click at the top of the number.
[5675.62s -> 5678.32s]  Click the number at the top the countdown or count up.
[5680.29s -> 5680.59s]  Okay.
[5680.79s -> 5682.79s]  At the top middle just click on the actual number.
[5682.79s -> 5685.69s]  Yes, click on that and then a little like refresh.
[5685.69s -> 5687.09s]  Click through a fresh button.
[5687.09s -> 5687.59s]  It'll move you.
[5687.59s -> 5687.89s]  There you go.
[5689.09s -> 5693.49s]  Yes, it turned my game volume up you guys shit on this team
[5693.49s -> 5695.39s]  like you should actually just dump through this thing.
[5695.79s -> 5697.69s]  You are giving me the confidence that I needed.
[5698.39s -> 5699.19s]  That's what we like to hear.
[5699.19s -> 5701.79s]  We want to see some five man air results from you.
[5701.99s -> 5706.69s]  Yes, you made some nutty plays and do crazy turns was feeling
[5706.69s -> 5707.39s]  the nutty plays.
[5707.39s -> 5708.89s]  Honestly, I was actually feeling them.
[5709.19s -> 5711.29s]  I had the nutty plays, but then I would get caught out and
[5711.29s -> 5713.59s]  then I also wouldn't be in front of poke, which is another
[5713.59s -> 5715.99s]  problem and I'm going to fix all these problems and it's
[5715.99s -> 5716.69s]  really late.
[5716.69s -> 5718.09s]  Like you guys are kind of like, what do we do?
[5718.09s -> 5718.69s]  You're running around.
[5718.69s -> 5721.09s]  You need to put some wards down and you need to make sure
[5721.09s -> 5721.89s]  they just don't do fire.
[5722.19s -> 5723.29s]  Oh, yeah, fight them.
[5724.09s -> 5725.79s]  Yeah, I'm going to try to just this time.
[5725.79s -> 5728.29s]  I'm going to try to have a ward at fire giant from like
[5728.29s -> 5729.49s]  five 10 minutes forward.
[5730.16s -> 5732.96s]  If you get a chance, if you're that deep, put them on their
[5732.96s -> 5734.26s]  side of the map on fire.
[5734.26s -> 5736.56s]  Yeah, you need one on the fire and the rest just on their
[5736.56s -> 5736.86s]  side.
[5736.86s -> 5737.46s]  So, you know where they are.
[5737.86s -> 5740.26s]  Yeah, also with awards, right?
[5740.26s -> 5741.56s]  It says upgrade your word.
[5741.56s -> 5743.46s]  Is that when you get the magic shell or what?
[5744.06s -> 5744.56s]  That's all great.
[5744.56s -> 5746.86s]  Your your relic you can make them better.
[5747.26s -> 5748.16s]  So yeah, like late game.
[5748.16s -> 5749.86s]  Once you have your full build upgrade, whatever you want.
[5750.86s -> 5753.66s]  Okay, so then how do I get more awards?
[5754.36s -> 5754.96s]  You just buy them.
[5754.96s -> 5756.76s]  They just they're 50 gold and then there's a bigger one.
[5756.76s -> 5757.56s]  That's 120.
[5757.96s -> 5759.46s]  Oh, okay.
[5759.46s -> 5760.66s]  The bigger one is the pink word.
[5760.66s -> 5763.16s]  That's invisible in the early game.
[5763.16s -> 5765.86s]  Just if you think about it, grab a single 50 gold word.
[5766.26s -> 5768.46s]  If you don't just in the late game is where like when you
[5768.46s -> 5770.16s]  get when you guys are grouped, like what the fuck do we do?
[5770.16s -> 5770.86s]  Where are they on this?
[5770.86s -> 5772.06s]  That's when you have to start working.
[5772.16s -> 5772.46s]  Yep.
[5772.46s -> 5773.06s]  Okay.
[5773.56s -> 5777.36s]  And get him out there or usually just ward gold fury and
[5777.36s -> 5780.36s]  fire giant and then after that just put it in random spots.
[5780.36s -> 5782.76s]  Yeah, that's actually all it needs to do.
[5783.56s -> 5784.66s]  Okay, let's go away.
[5784.66s -> 5785.36s]  If you get hit.
[5786.26s -> 5787.66s]  No, they'll keep taking.
[5789.00s -> 5791.20s]  Yeah, if you start a fight, pop them like I can't.
[5793.20s -> 5793.80s]  Yes, you can.
[5794.30s -> 5794.60s]  Okay.
[5794.60s -> 5795.50s]  And then what about my aegis?
[5795.50s -> 5797.10s]  Do I press my E plus my aegis?
[5797.10s -> 5800.00s]  Basically your aegis you want to use to not take damage.
[5800.00s -> 5802.40s]  So like if you everyone's jumping on you or fucking you up,
[5802.40s -> 5804.80s]  you want to use that but you cannot use that when you're
[5804.80s -> 5805.20s]  cc'd.
[5806.60s -> 5807.30s]  I give you your son.
[5807.30s -> 5810.50s]  You cannot be Angie basically or whatever you can beads
[5810.50s -> 5811.10s]  and then aegis.
[5811.10s -> 5813.60s]  Yeah, if you need to or if you just know the damage is about
[5813.60s -> 5814.50s]  to come, you can just pop.
[5818.31s -> 5819.71s]  That's actually super smart.
[5819.91s -> 5822.91s]  And then I can I can but I can't cast abilities not in the
[5822.91s -> 5824.21s]  aegis with the beads.
[5824.21s -> 5825.41s]  You can you beads.
[5825.41s -> 5827.61s]  You're like ready to fuck him up like you pop that just turn
[5827.61s -> 5831.41s]  and start fucking wailing on beads is like BKB and the
[5831.41s -> 5832.91s]  beads will last a couple seconds.
[5832.91s -> 5833.81s]  It's two seconds.
[5833.81s -> 5834.11s]  Yep.
[5834.51s -> 5836.21s]  Okay, so I said your fly is down.
[5836.31s -> 5838.21s]  I don't have any clothes on that's impossible.
[5838.61s -> 5839.21s]  Uh-huh.
[5839.91s -> 5840.81s]  You're naked.
[5842.12s -> 5843.02s]  Oh, right.
[5843.02s -> 5844.72s]  I forgot a minute call for everybody.
[5844.82s -> 5846.72s]  You didn't you didn't tell us that you were naked.
[5846.72s -> 5848.42s]  Is that what we're all supposed to be playing like so we
[5848.42s -> 5849.22s]  can play better?
[5849.42s -> 5852.12s]  You'll turn on the webcam like team synergy or something.
[5852.12s -> 5852.72s]  Stand up.
[5853.62s -> 5854.52s]  Look at this team synergy.
[5854.52s -> 5857.62s]  They have they all have fucking the sad Pepe face.
[5857.72s -> 5859.52s]  Yeah, because that's going to be them when they lost.
[5859.62s -> 5860.12s]  Yeah.
[5862.32s -> 5863.92s]  Sure for that's a fact.
[5863.92s -> 5866.32s]  Shrew for God.
[5868.85s -> 5869.65s]  Hold on a sec.
[5869.65s -> 5871.45s]  When do we press press play?
[5871.75s -> 5873.95s]  Hold on a second guys.
[5873.95s -> 5877.25s]  I'm opening up chest so I can get the so I can get this
[5877.25s -> 5878.15s]  skin real quick.

[5880.05s -> 5882.74s]  It's going to be big.
[5883.68s -> 5890.09s]  $100 skin or boss keep going.
[5890.99s -> 5892.09s]  I just got hold on.
[5892.59s -> 5893.79s]  We essential bees.
[5894.09s -> 5894.99s]  What's wrong Jerma?
[5895.19s -> 5896.29s]  What's wrong team captain?
[5897.69s -> 5899.99s]  I did hold on if we if we have time, but it's something
[5899.99s -> 5902.99s]  that I captain the team captain has something to potentially
[5902.99s -> 5903.69s]  show.
[5904.29s -> 5906.19s]  Oh, no team captain can't do it.
[5906.19s -> 5907.59s]  You're going to show it, huh?
[5907.69s -> 5909.79s]  My girlfriend took a picture of me when I was sitting here.
[5914.69s -> 5915.39s]  I got it.
[5915.69s -> 5916.59s]  I got it.
[5917.29s -> 5917.49s]  All right.
[5917.49s -> 5918.39s]  What do we what's going on here?
[5919.03s -> 5922.27s]  I got the skin was banning banning.
[5922.27s -> 5924.06s]  Wait, what?
[5924.50s -> 5925.60s]  No, it's a little wrong.
[5926.71s -> 5928.51s]  Dude, I'm just going to pass ban.
[5929.61s -> 5930.31s]  That's what we're doing.
[5930.31s -> 5931.51s]  I think they're just passing.
[5931.61s -> 5932.21s]  Okay.
[5932.21s -> 5933.21s]  Oh my God.
[5934.01s -> 5934.91s]  Now we're picking.
[5934.91s -> 5935.81s]  No, there's no bands.
[5936.81s -> 5937.31s]  Okay.
[5938.77s -> 5939.77s]  Can I even show this?
[5943.25s -> 5948.08s]  Hey, stay tuned for next game when I when I show a picture
[5948.08s -> 5948.98s]  of something funny.
[5950.08s -> 5951.28s]  Can I frag out Azul?
[5953.42s -> 5954.32s]  I have to sneeze.
[5956.30s -> 5958.80s]  I feel like it's just kind of weak because I yeah, I throw
[5958.80s -> 5962.76s]  the axe and then I kind of need to be confident in Russell.
[5964.26s -> 5965.46s]  I got to focus right now.
[5965.46s -> 5965.96s]  I'm okay.
[5965.96s -> 5966.86s]  Chats going down.
[5967.36s -> 5967.86s]  I'll show it.
[5967.86s -> 5968.76s]  I'll show it next game.
[5969.06s -> 5969.46s]  You got it.
[5969.46s -> 5970.36s]  You got to do what for me?
[5970.36s -> 5971.46s]  I can't see chat anymore.
[5972.26s -> 5974.36s]  He needs to be confident in you to play.
[5975.50s -> 5978.80s]  I am extremely confident that I will play well here because
[5978.80s -> 5981.40s]  I just opened up a skin and it's over.
[5981.40s -> 5982.10s]  It's GGs.
[5983.10s -> 5983.97s]  Same.
[5985.60s -> 5986.60s]  You got the cat ears.
[5987.44s -> 5988.44s]  No, I got your mind.
[5988.44s -> 5989.04s]  That's pokes.
[5989.04s -> 5989.34s]  Nevermind.
[5989.34s -> 5991.74s]  I got the higher gun Aries meow.
[5992.44s -> 5995.24s]  What it was a one in 120 chance of getting it.
[5996.54s -> 5997.61s]  Meow.
[5998.31s -> 5998.71s]  Meow.
[5998.71s -> 6001.21s]  So their first character they picked is their jungler.
[6001.61s -> 6004.11s]  He has an ability that makes him not take any damage and
[6004.11s -> 6006.31s]  then he has three damaging abilities that are all just
[6006.31s -> 6006.81s]  abilities.
[6006.81s -> 6007.61s]  Thanatos.
[6007.81s -> 6012.11s]  Thanatos where solo probably young actually.
[6012.31s -> 6014.11s]  Okay, that might be Robin a solo Thanatos.
[6015.78s -> 6016.18s]  Yep.
[6016.58s -> 6017.58s]  Is there a loser bracket?
[6017.98s -> 6018.78s]  I don't think so.
[6019.91s -> 6021.01s]  So we can't get first anymore.
[6021.41s -> 6022.21s]  So he's a win.
[6022.21s -> 6023.91s]  We can get out of this is a group.
[6026.15s -> 6029.85s]  Basically, we have to come out of this to to minimum.
[6029.85s -> 6030.65s]  You need to win the next game.
[6030.65s -> 6031.15s]  So be tuned.
[6031.15s -> 6034.55s]  Yeah, when it's yeah two and one and then we play semi-finals,
[6034.55s -> 6034.95s]  right?
[6036.25s -> 6037.65s]  Oh, no, no, it's fun.
[6039.52s -> 6041.82s]  I think it should be semis and then finals.
[6042.42s -> 6043.42s]  I think I don't know.
[6043.82s -> 6049.57s]  Okay, I was in cabs should be in the ADC lane against you
[6049.57s -> 6049.97s]  guys.
[6050.77s -> 6053.67s]  Your Ares all will bop them if it's be like he beads are
[6053.67s -> 6054.57s]  his only way of getting out of it.
[6056.87s -> 6060.27s]  My Ares all what sorry will fuck up the amusing cab.
[6060.27s -> 6061.07s]  They're second pick.
[6061.77s -> 6063.37s]  He doesn't have any way to get out of your all other than
[6063.37s -> 6063.87s]  his beats.
[6064.27s -> 6065.27s]  Okay, amusing cab.
[6066.07s -> 6067.07s]  That's the one with the bees.
[6067.07s -> 6070.47s]  You told me about and that's what I'm playing against.
[6071.27s -> 6071.87s]  I don't know.
[6071.87s -> 6073.67s]  I think you're going to be against the Robin of the first
[6073.67s -> 6073.87s]  year.
[6077.57s -> 6081.07s]  He's got a route a slow and a leap that slams.
[6082.07s -> 6082.87s]  I'm going to piss on him.
[6083.87s -> 6084.17s]  Huh?
[6085.17s -> 6085.57s]  What?
[6089.16s -> 6092.26s]  All right, guys, let's do a little pep talk here.
[6093.06s -> 6094.46s]  Let's hear everybody.
[6096.08s -> 6097.38s]  Try to do your best.
[6098.15s -> 6101.15s]  If you don't do your best then fuck you.
[6101.65s -> 6103.05s]  Can you sing the song for me?
[6104.51s -> 6105.71s]  Do you want to sing that?
[6106.11s -> 6107.11s]  Yeah, sing the song.
[6108.91s -> 6110.31s]  Try your best.
[6110.61s -> 6111.61s]  Do your best.
[6114.15s -> 6114.95s]  The song.
[6115.15s -> 6115.85s]  Wait, what happened?
[6116.72s -> 6117.72s]  They didn't make a selection.
[6122.52s -> 6123.62s]  They were power gaming.
[6126.39s -> 6127.59s]  We got to pick quicker than that.
[6128.99s -> 6129.79s]  I didn't do it.
[6130.29s -> 6131.29s]  Is that lobby still up?
[6131.29s -> 6132.99s]  Am I supposed to be seeing a screen right now?
[6132.99s -> 6133.99s]  Because I'm not seeing a screen.
[6133.99s -> 6135.79s]  And Chovies was an empty planet RuneScape.
[6135.79s -> 6136.99s]  We should have an automatic win.
[6139.96s -> 6140.96s]  That's unacceptable.
[6141.26s -> 6141.96s]  They're power games.
[6141.96s -> 6143.16s]  They're wasting everybody's time.
[6143.76s -> 6144.76s]  Yeah, give us that dove.
[6145.06s -> 6145.56s]  Miss.
[6146.76s -> 6147.26s]  Call the miss.
[6147.56s -> 6148.06s]  Report him.
[6150.00s -> 6151.90s]  We should get a thousand extra gold on our team.
[6152.50s -> 6152.90s]  Each.
[6153.90s -> 6154.20s]  True.
[6155.13s -> 6155.63s]  Dollars.
[6156.13s -> 6158.03s]  Is that lobby up or no?
[6160.97s -> 6161.97s]  I don't want to show it.
[6163.07s -> 6164.07s]  Who's the Ninja Turtle?
[6165.55s -> 6166.35s]  I think it's this.
[6166.75s -> 6167.45s]  This is a bunch.
[6167.95s -> 6169.65s]  Russell, your shit might be fucked.
[6171.25s -> 6171.65s]  I think so.
[6171.65s -> 6172.45s]  I think you need a reload.
[6172.75s -> 6174.45s]  Oh no.
[6174.45s -> 6176.38s]  It was actually good that they dodged.
[6176.88s -> 6177.18s]  Okay.
[6178.22s -> 6178.62s]  Why?
[6179.49s -> 6179.99s]  Resetting.
[6180.49s -> 6183.19s]  But like he has his numbers stuck and I don't think he was in your lobby.
[6183.19s -> 6184.59s]  Like I don't think he could actually see it.
[6184.59s -> 6184.79s]  Yeah.
[6184.79s -> 6185.79s]  I couldn't see anything.
[6185.79s -> 6186.39s]  That's why I wasn't.
[6186.39s -> 6186.69s]  Oh shit.
[6186.69s -> 6187.59s]  I didn't know you guys were even.
[6190.22s -> 6190.92s]  Last thing in disguise.
[6200.96s -> 6201.36s]  Oh yeah.
[6201.36s -> 6203.76s]  Jeremy last game you went to kill the duo lane.
[6203.86s -> 6205.76s]  Hit level two first before you do anything like that.
[6205.86s -> 6206.16s]  Okay.
[6207.94s -> 6208.14s]  Yeah.
[6208.14s -> 6211.44s]  Try and clear your jungle a lot first before gank ruining.
[6211.64s -> 6213.24s]  Unless it's like a really obvious game.
[6213.94s -> 6215.74s]  Did you know that guy makes videos on this game?
[6215.84s -> 6216.94s]  What are you talking to your report?
[6217.34s -> 6217.64s]  Huh?
[6218.24s -> 6218.84s]  Oh my bad.
[6219.94s -> 6220.94s]  I should know my place.
[6220.94s -> 6221.44s]  They needed.
[6222.24s -> 6222.64s]  Okay.
[6223.74s -> 6226.84s]  I mean I I can take some light criticism though, right?
[6226.84s -> 6227.94s]  I mean I got it.
[6227.94s -> 6228.44s]  I got it.
[6228.74s -> 6229.44s]  Very light.
[6233.05s -> 6234.65s]  Like I know to not suck.
[6234.65s -> 6238.55s]  Just stuff stuff like stuff like oh like this game.
[6239.56s -> 6240.66s]  Yeah, how are you good at this?
[6240.66s -> 6241.26s]  I can lie.
[6241.26s -> 6242.56s]  You're really fucking.
[6244.76s -> 6245.66s]  I'm good at every game.
[6245.66s -> 6246.16s]  I play.
[6246.36s -> 6248.76s]  That is a point and overwatch.
[6248.76s -> 6250.36s]  She was a pro at every character too.
[6253.09s -> 6253.89s]  Yeah, that's actually it.
[6253.99s -> 6254.29s]  Yeah.
[6254.59s -> 6254.99s]  Okay.
[6255.09s -> 6255.59s]  How do I join?
[6255.69s -> 6258.90s]  Oh, I got you.
[6258.90s -> 6260.80s]  I'm going to join through poke.
[6260.80s -> 6262.50s]  I guess I can you join through poke?
[6262.50s -> 6263.30s]  I don't think you can.
[6263.30s -> 6263.90s]  I think you need to go.
[6263.90s -> 6264.90s]  No, that's why I did last time.
[6264.90s -> 6265.30s]  I'm good.
[6265.40s -> 6265.80s]  We're good.
[6266.34s -> 6266.84s]  Oh, there we go.
[6266.84s -> 6267.44s]  I'm in baby.
[6268.89s -> 6270.99s]  He has like my icon by the way or new lobby.
[6270.99s -> 6271.39s]  All right.
[6271.49s -> 6272.29s]  Are we all in here?
[6273.48s -> 6273.88s]  Yes.
[6274.38s -> 6274.88s]  All right.
[6274.88s -> 6276.08s]  I'm joining the new lobby.
[6277.53s -> 6278.03s]  Yes.
[6279.80s -> 6280.80s]  Enough talk.
[6284.64s -> 6286.24s]  Now it's time to chug their beer.
[6286.24s -> 6288.44s]  Like are we good to go now?
[6288.44s -> 6291.78s]  I think how do we trash talk the other team?
[6291.78s -> 6293.98s]  Can they see what we type you guys?
[6293.98s -> 6295.48s]  No, you know right now they can.
[6295.48s -> 6296.83s]  Yeah.
[6297.03s -> 6298.03s]  Oh no, you're talking to party.
[6299.43s -> 6301.63s]  Oh, no, that's we're going to lose man.
[6302.92s -> 6305.02s]  No, you guys are going to lose.
[6305.98s -> 6306.88s]  Oh got it.
[6306.88s -> 6313.83s]  Now I can type lol XD match accepted.
[6315.24s -> 6319.23s]  Yeah, they'll have bands on go baby.
[6320.52s -> 6322.62s]  Just skip the bands for now.
[6322.72s -> 6325.12s]  You're my oh, I'll just cheat it.
[6325.12s -> 6327.42s]  I say we just cheat it and ban their their champs.
[6328.12s -> 6331.22s]  The rabbit up open up their streams ban their champs and keep
[6331.22s -> 6331.72s]  it moving.
[6337.04s -> 6338.34s]  What do we think in here?
[6338.54s -> 6339.24s]  All right.
[6340.08s -> 6341.28s]  No, don't ban Baka Sora.
[6341.28s -> 6342.58s]  I wanted to pick Baka Sora.
[6343.88s -> 6344.78s]  It would have been horrible.
[6351.04s -> 6351.64s]  Excuse me.
[6352.64s -> 6354.24s]  That'd be so funny if I did that though.
[6354.84s -> 6355.84s]  I'd have to play Thanatos.
[6358.64s -> 6359.54s]  I know how to play him.
[6364.40s -> 6366.00s]  This game needs like a UI upgrade.
[6369.64s -> 6370.74s]  It's just like League though.
[6373.58s -> 6374.28s]  Yeah, it's ugly.
[6379.64s -> 6384.07s]  I think it's hard to do shit quick doing a UI upgrade.
[6384.07s -> 6387.27s]  I think for a game that has this many things to look at.
[6387.57s -> 6388.37s]  I feel like it's hard.
[6389.77s -> 6393.00s]  Yeah, but look at like the bottom when you hover over a
[6393.00s -> 6393.30s]  character.
[6393.30s -> 6396.30s]  It's like it looks so plain.
[6398.56s -> 6398.96s]  I raise it.
[6398.96s -> 6400.26s]  If you're listening ready.
[6400.36s -> 6401.16s]  Oh, they did it ready.
[6408.53s -> 6409.63s]  You got here again.
[6409.73s -> 6410.13s]  Yeah.
[6411.63s -> 6413.03s]  Wait, is it my turn pick?
[6413.83s -> 6414.73s]  Oh, she's banning.
[6418.93s -> 6420.03s]  Emery is banning again.
[6420.53s -> 6422.03s]  Yeah, we have to pass it back and forth.
[6425.81s -> 6426.71s]  Silly guys.
[6426.81s -> 6427.81s]  Very very silly.
[6429.46s -> 6430.76s]  Low magical damage.
[6430.86s -> 6431.36s]  Uh-oh.
[6431.96s -> 6433.96s]  I mean the UI definitely has been updated in this game.
[6433.96s -> 6437.36s]  Because I remember playing back in like the day, you know,
[6437.36s -> 6438.76s]  back when we were all younger.
[6438.76s -> 6439.56s]  Oh, we don't have low magic.
[6439.56s -> 6440.86s]  We have low magic in the UI.
[6442.96s -> 6443.46s]  That's true.
[6444.36s -> 6446.26s]  By the way, those of you that are watching the drops are
[6446.26s -> 6446.86s]  enabled.
[6447.06s -> 6448.46s]  There is a custom.
[6448.86s -> 6451.36s]  Not custom a new a is it even new?
[6451.36s -> 6451.76s]  I don't know.
[6451.76s -> 6453.46s]  There's a skin as a cupid skin.
[6453.46s -> 6459.36s]  It's called cupid dreadnought and it is a this if you support
[6459.66s -> 6463.86s]  team this team here, you can potentially get that if you
[6464.26s -> 6465.16s]  drops are enabled.
[6465.96s -> 6466.86s]  So give it a look.
[6467.76s -> 6468.36s]  Yeah.
[6468.86s -> 6469.76s]  Yeah, we're the best team.
[6470.16s -> 6471.06s]  We are number one.
[6471.46s -> 6473.26s]  Are you an infomercial salesman?
[6474.46s -> 6475.36s]  I'm trying to sell it.
[6482.46s -> 6485.16s]  Give me one five second tip on jungle that I didn't do last
[6485.16s -> 6485.36s]  game.
[6485.36s -> 6486.76s]  I need my farm more.
[6486.96s -> 6488.56s]  Okay, farm a lot more.
[6488.66s -> 6489.06s]  Okay.
[6489.76s -> 6491.96s]  I farm a lot more copy paste this.
[6501.96s -> 6502.76s]  Thank you very much.
[6502.76s -> 6503.36s]  I see you later.
[6505.86s -> 6507.56s]  So they got danisos in the jungle.
[6508.66s -> 6510.26s]  I think I don't know whatever.
[6511.26s -> 6512.56s]  He's using the misc if skin.
[6512.86s -> 6513.26s]  Yeah.
[6516.26s -> 6518.76s]  Wait, they all have the same profile picture look like that.
[6519.66s -> 6520.76s]  Does that mean he actually plays the game?
[6520.76s -> 6521.56s]  We should have done that.
[6521.66s -> 6522.16s]  Oh boy.
[6533.00s -> 6533.40s]  All right.
[6534.30s -> 6535.70s]  I feel like this game is gonna go smoother.
[6536.10s -> 6536.80s]  Let's make it happen.
[6538.42s -> 6539.42s]  Do I buy five pots?
[6539.42s -> 6539.82s]  Wait a minute.
[6539.92s -> 6540.72s]  I have extra money.
[6541.52s -> 6542.02s]  You buy it.
[6542.96s -> 6545.36s]  You shouldn't have extra money eat speed speeds.
[6545.36s -> 6547.36s]  That's why fucking music is too loud.
[6550.64s -> 6551.24s]  Shut up.
[6551.24s -> 6553.54s]  Sure for even looking.
[6553.54s -> 6554.14s]  I knew it was you.
[6554.14s -> 6555.24s]  I'm like, no, I still have money.
[6555.24s -> 6558.34s]  I bought death toll and she knows me in three pots.
[6558.34s -> 6559.14s]  You just do that.
[6559.14s -> 6559.74s]  I know.
[6560.34s -> 6560.74s]  All right.
[6561.14s -> 6563.24s]  How do you know heads in the game?
[6564.80s -> 6565.80s]  Go to where you need to be.
[6567.31s -> 6568.41s]  We got to win this one.
[6569.61s -> 6570.51s]  I'm starting three daddy.
[6571.65s -> 6573.55s]  I didn't buy my beads poke.
[6575.88s -> 6577.08s]  Poke communicate with me.
[6579.28s -> 6581.18s]  Remember don't take my camp or else.
[6581.58s -> 6582.18s]  I swear to God.
[6582.18s -> 6583.88s]  I will run it down mid if you take my camp.
[6584.28s -> 6584.58s]  No.
[6586.36s -> 6586.66s]  Okay.
[6589.45s -> 6591.25s]  All right guys play well play hard.
[6592.51s -> 6594.41s]  We got a three Royale.
[6594.41s -> 6597.71s]  Yeah, for tonight without character board right now.
[6597.71s -> 6599.41s]  Just wiped out Tomato Town.
[6600.60s -> 6601.40s]  It's a different game.
[6601.40s -> 6602.40s]  Stop singing that.
[6602.40s -> 6603.20s]  They're back in now.
[6603.20s -> 6606.00s]  I'm so I'm not going to be there in time.
[6608.82s -> 6610.12s]  Oh jeez award.
[6613.50s -> 6614.20s]  They hit it first.
[6615.56s -> 6616.76s]  The game the game is so loud.
[6616.76s -> 6617.86s]  Now, oops.
[6618.26s -> 6619.06s]  Your game is loud.
[6619.06s -> 6620.26s]  No, I turned it up.
[6621.60s -> 6623.50s]  I'll turn it down in the game.
[6623.60s -> 6624.20s]  I'll turn it down.
[6629.43s -> 6630.03s]  Perfect.
[6633.90s -> 6634.10s]  All right.
[6634.10s -> 6634.50s]  Let's do it.
[6635.10s -> 6636.50s]  Oh, I just got stunned.
[6638.80s -> 6640.00s]  Very very confident.
[6640.00s -> 6641.90s]  I don't know why but I'm feeling so wrong.
[6642.10s -> 6643.10s]  They went the wrong way.
[6645.28s -> 6646.58s]  Why does it get so loud?
[6646.58s -> 6647.98s]  I turned up like a tiny bit.
[6650.77s -> 6651.07s]  All right.
[6651.07s -> 6651.47s]  Good luck.
[6652.15s -> 6652.85s]  They're level two.
[6653.15s -> 6653.65s]  Thank you.
[6654.05s -> 6654.55s]  We got a bet.
[6654.75s -> 6655.45s]  Do we have to back up?
[6655.45s -> 6656.95s]  Yeah, I feel like we have to back up because they're level two.
[6661.64s -> 6663.94s]  Like the game volume went up like crazy.
[6669.40s -> 6670.00s]  Oh, wow.
[6672.66s -> 6675.76s]  I'm backing up as you should.
[6681.39s -> 6683.69s]  Hey, help me help me help me help me in the jungle in the jungle in the jungle.
[6683.69s -> 6684.59s]  Come come come in the jungle.
[6685.09s -> 6686.09s]  Oh, I'm coming.
[6686.09s -> 6686.59s]  I'm coming coming.
[6687.49s -> 6688.19s]  Careful back it up.
[6688.19s -> 6688.59s]  Okay.
[6689.59s -> 6690.79s]  We could do this little totem thing.
[6693.68s -> 6694.08s]  Be careful.
[6694.08s -> 6694.48s]  They're going in.
[6694.48s -> 6694.78s]  They're going in.
[6694.78s -> 6695.18s]  Careful.
[6696.45s -> 6696.75s]  I'm good.
[6696.75s -> 6697.05s]  I'm good.
[6703.78s -> 6704.48s]  We might go to kill here.
[6705.08s -> 6706.38s]  Let's punish that we can.
[6707.28s -> 6709.08s]  Now back it up back it up back it up back it up back it up back it up.
[6709.08s -> 6709.58s]  Not worth it.
[6710.48s -> 6711.28s]  Oh my god.
[6711.98s -> 6713.38s]  Bro, that ability is nuts.
[6714.68s -> 6715.28s]  Not worth it.
[6716.76s -> 6717.66s]  My base here.
[6725.03s -> 6726.63s]  I know we can start screaming right now.
[6730.68s -> 6732.38s]  He's probably like, you're not supposed to be over there.
[6733.64s -> 6733.94s]  They're low.
[6733.94s -> 6734.44s]  They're low.
[6734.84s -> 6735.14s]  Yep.
[6735.14s -> 6737.34s]  I'm oh, I just got stunned out of my out of my three.
[6739.36s -> 6740.56s]  I got stunned out of my three.
[6742.58s -> 6743.18s]  Okay, let's go.
[6743.18s -> 6743.78s]  Let's go back.
[6745.38s -> 6746.48s]  We actually back them out of lane.
[6746.48s -> 6747.58s]  So that could be good for us.
[6750.42s -> 6751.32s]  Left side is MA.
[6756.94s -> 6757.84s]  I'm going to get mid buff.
[6760.75s -> 6762.25s]  Is there any buff that we can get while they're gone?
[6765.62s -> 6767.42s]  Um, I don't think so.
[6777.30s -> 6778.30s]  Left side, MA stuff.
[6779.18s -> 6779.48s]  Never mind.
[6779.48s -> 6779.98s]  He's back.
[6780.18s -> 6780.68s]  Perfect.
[6783.75s -> 6784.95s]  Buff is down here for one of you guys.
[6785.45s -> 6785.85s]  Yeah.
[6787.14s -> 6789.04s]  We might actually have an aggressive here.
[6792.00s -> 6795.54s]  Oh wait, they do have items, but oh, how you guys doing you guys?
[6795.84s -> 6797.04s]  Hey guys, they're getting too though.
[6797.04s -> 6800.04s]  They're getting their junglers.

[9013.20s -> 9018.40s]  There's one. Yeah, we're gonna fight it. Now's the time. Yeah, because one of them split. Maybe we should just
[9018.72s -> 9021.84s]  I put a bunch of traps on it. I put a bunch of traps on here. We should fight or the
[9023.12s -> 9025.12s]  We should do it. All right

[9155.68s -> 9160.50s]  Oh, I didn't I wanted to see the detail of the match shit. Oops. How do you see it by accident bruh?
[9160.66s -> 9167.63s]  Yeah, I clicked back like an idiot. Well, there we go. Hey, at least we won one
[9170.37s -> 9172.37s]  You can't say at least we won. Yeah
[9173.41s -> 9175.65s]  We're gonna win. What do you mean at least?
[9177.82s -> 9182.38s]  I mean at the at the very end of the day. No matter what happens. We won a game
[9184.40s -> 9186.54s]  Okay, germ
[9186.54s -> 9190.59s]  Always a lot of damage. We did a lot. I think we could win the whole thing
[9191.57s -> 9192.53s]  Yeah
[9192.53s -> 9199.55s]  Player image wait, I only did 17k
[9200.03s -> 9205.66s]  18k player damage. I feel like that's not a lot. I mean compared to 40 and 30
[9205.66s -> 9208.22s]  No, but I mean you still did more damage than most the other team
[9213.31s -> 9222.64s]  I can see the chat again. Hold on. So i'm not doing my role, correct? Um, I really don't know
[9224.56s -> 9230.16s]  Uh coach is he doing all right? Yeah, where's our coach coach? Is he doing all right? Does he need a whipping?
[9232.14s -> 9237.20s]  I think coach might be afk
[9242.11s -> 9242.99s]  Be right back
[9242.99s -> 9246.78s]  I think we just got to be more assertive when we know we're stronger
[9247.84s -> 9252.18s]  True
[9252.18s -> 9254.42s]  I did do a lot of structure damage
[9254.50s -> 9256.50s]  That's good. That's good. Lots of pushing
[9257.14s -> 9259.86s]  Yeah, my structure damage was 8 000. You guys were
[9260.58s -> 9261.62s]  a thousand
[9261.62s -> 9265.17s]  and 200 300
[9265.17s -> 9267.17s]  Okay, so that was my role
[9268.40s -> 9273.04s]  I didn't do a lot of structure damage or damage in general, but I did
[9274.08s -> 9276.08s]  do some stunning
[9276.66s -> 9278.29s]  So
[9278.29s -> 9283.33s]  Yeah, I think what we also need to do is I also need to combine my alt because my alt is a silence
[9283.97s -> 9288.26s]  So if you pull them in and I silence them, they can't shrink it. Yeah
[9290.18s -> 9292.18s]  That's actually smart. Holy shit. Yeah
[9294.27s -> 9296.27s]  So you want to know how to win the next game?
[9296.74s -> 9297.62s]  Yes
[9297.62s -> 9298.58s]  uh
[9298.58s -> 9304.58s]  Russell be like when you guys are grouping around the fire blink and just fucking just pull your dick out and slap them around
[9304.90s -> 9309.14s]  Like just go run at them that heard of anything. Okay. You know what what happened?
[9309.70s -> 9323.95s]  Hey that herman miller chair sure is good, isn't it? I'm not I have I have shorts on okay
[9324.03s -> 9330.75s]  I've got shorts on I've got shorts on I just i'm i'm a gamer
[9345.62s -> 9348.74s]  I'm i'm i'm gaming i'm i'm intensely gaming
[9360.43s -> 9366.83s]  I have to pee i'll be back
[9366.83s -> 9371.70s]  When you're low he can see you all the time. So that was fucking you even more. Oh
[9372.42s -> 9380.48s]  That's how he alts you no matter what. Yep. I gotta pee. I'll be right back. Where's the picture of germa playing naked
[9380.80s -> 9382.80s]  You missed it. I put it up already
[9382.80s -> 9390.37s]  Where if somebody will show you it's it's it's it's not even a big deal. I'll be right back first pick or not germa germa
[9390.85s -> 9394.11s]  I'll be right back. No
[9394.19s -> 9397.42s]  Pick shouldn't matter to be honest
[9398.93s -> 9403.76s]  Okay, you all are just gonna take whatever you want and they're just gonna do the same thing
[9403.92s -> 9411.62s]  He's playing naked you guys are second pick last game in the other games, right?
[9412.98s -> 9416.98s]  I feel like we all have to go naked. Yeah, I was gonna say like I feel like we have to take on more clothes
[9417.38s -> 9426.88s]  Oh, yeah, when you're in lane make sure you guys use your potions
[9428.66s -> 9432.90s]  Like just if you're doing anything just pop them if you're at all low hp, you don't need to be super low
[9438.96s -> 9439.44s]  Wait, sorry
[9439.44s -> 9442.08s]  What did you say? I zoned out for a second when when you're in lane
[9442.16s -> 9446.24s]  Even if you're just a little low like say you're at 80% health, just use your potions. Make sure you're okay
[9446.32s -> 9450.72s]  It's okay. I'd rather you waste them than just die. The miss gift skin is so ugly
[9452.16s -> 9454.16s]  It's definitely an odd skin
[9454.24s -> 9457.28s]  I don't want to be me but it's it's scary as hell looking
[9461.23s -> 9463.23s]  Oh, yeah, no, there's no going
[9463.23s -> 9463.95s]  Yeah
[9463.95s -> 9468.35s]  Um, you know your you when you buy buy the death toll first
[9468.91s -> 9475.95s]  Your second item it builds into that transcendence item. It's called morningstar. You want to buy like the tier one of that transcendence
[9477.57s -> 9482.77s]  Did I not do that? No, no, no you bought you almost bought nothing which would have fucking screwed you
[9483.09s -> 9485.09s]  Really bad
[9485.65s -> 9491.33s]  Yeah, so buy the buy the death toll then buy that item then buy your potion and he's part about it
[9492.29s -> 9496.13s]  Okay. Okay. No, go ahead. The purification beads shouldn't cost anything. They're free
[9496.69s -> 9499.17s]  Okay, so death toll how many potions?
[9499.65s -> 9502.37s]  Uh, it should be I think it's four or five
[9502.77s -> 9503.81s]  Yeah, it's five
[9503.81s -> 9509.41s]  Yeah, buy yeah buy the morningstar and then just buy the you max out five potions and that's fine. You can just buy
[9509.49s -> 9511.49s]  No, no, no, no buy death toll

[9523.97s -> 9525.57s]  Are you eating?
[9525.57s -> 9527.57s]  Yeah, some garlic
[9528.37s -> 9529.65s]  Oh my bad
[9529.65s -> 9531.65s]  I did it. I pulled a germa. What'd you say?
[9532.53s -> 9534.85s]  I said what am I someone asked what I was eating because I was eating
[9535.73s -> 9540.69s]  I was about to tell them but then I hotmicked. Oh, are you eating? Can you tell me now?
[9541.49s -> 9545.35s]  Almonds, yeah garlic rosemary almonds interesting
[9547.25s -> 9551.97s]  Late game you're super tanky too. You can just run into phoenixes and shit like don't like yeah
[9551.97s -> 9555.89s]  That's what I was 10 minutes, but you can take them for a little bit. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I was saying. Um
[9556.53s -> 9560.69s]  Whenever we were like chilling at the phoenix like I could tank it a little bit until the minions come well, russell
[9560.69s -> 9564.61s]  When you know, we're stronger you can just fucking go into the enemy team
[9565.81s -> 9568.05s]  Yeah after 30 minutes to that fire giant
[9568.05s -> 9571.65s]  It'll make it so you kill the phoenixes instantly like you just all do it once it'll die
[9572.21s -> 9576.69s]  Oh cool. If you have a purple fire giant on your buff bar, you'll just kill everything
[9582.00s -> 9596.27s]  You guys see the earn free rewards thing in game, yeah watch ads bro, that's cool. We have to watch ads

[9878.24s -> 9881.18s]  Sure for it, dude
[9882.14s -> 9886.30s]  No, we don't just have sure for we have sure for we have germa we have noko we have russell
[9886.62s -> 9890.43s]  We have pokey walls. We have weakened. We're gonna win. I think we got
[9891.71s -> 9894.83s]  That is actually all we have. Yeah. Yeah, that is it exactly
[9896.69s -> 9901.49s]  So if we lose this then we watch the rest of the tournament. Oh, it's for who to watch not who to win
[9901.65s -> 9904.77s]  Oh, never think i'm gonna watch the rest of the tournament. We're gonna win this for who to win
[9907.73s -> 9913.66s]  Did they spectate our game once or no? I think what about the slipknot stuff? Yeah, the slipknot stuff is um,
[9914.14s -> 9923.18s]  I think this game is gonna be interesting. There's channel though on the stream. Poseidon is a lot of it, right?
[9924.30s -> 9930.94s]  If I lose this game, i'm going to apex and soloqueue ranked and getting depression same here. We're not gonna lose
[9931.02s -> 9934.14s]  We're not gonna lose. That's the thing. I'm literally the plat gatekeeper
[9934.78s -> 9939.47s]  I fell out of pred i'm dog shit. No
[9940.51s -> 9946.19s]  I'm perpetually diamond one. No d4 plat one d4 plat one d4 plat one
[9946.27s -> 9948.99s]  Apparently they watched the end of your last game too, so they get to see bop
[9949.63s -> 9952.94s]  Nice
[9952.94s -> 9959.02s]  Should I be the stranger things monster for this one? Are we uh, did it did it when are we starting?
[9959.34s -> 9965.82s]  I switch my characters take too much working. Whatever you want bro. Don't let your memes be dreams. No, honestly
[9966.14s -> 9968.14s]  No other character better than you should just stay
[9969.02s -> 9975.54s]  There's gonna be different animations for the new skins and stuff. Now i'm staying with the metal one. That'll fuck with me
[9975.78s -> 9987.49s]  All right, I think we should just win. Yeah. Yeah, we should that sounds like a good idea just win forehead
[9988.45s -> 9991.25s]  Okay, so let's do that then I think we have a pretty decent chance
[9992.24s -> 9998.40s]  To just win forehead. Okay. Whoa, wait, we're all playing the same characters. Okay
[9999.20s -> 10002.80s]  So russia you go in your ultimate is a pull
[10003.36s -> 10004.56s]  Yeah, it's like well
[10004.56s -> 10009.04s]  It's like you started off and I have to get them in the circle and then like the pool takes like I think
[10009.12s -> 10012.48s]  Four seconds or three seconds or something. It's one of the easiest ults in the game to beads
[10013.28s -> 10014.16s]  Yeah
[10014.16s -> 10016.80s]  That's the biggest problem like I can say i'm gonna pull them
[10016.80s -> 10021.36s]  But if they beads it I don't pull them you actually got two double kills because they beads it too early
[10022.32s -> 10024.32s]  Yeah, did they really
[10024.56s -> 10029.74s]  Yeah, you did. That's kind of sad. Wait, how do how do they beads it too early?
[10029.90s -> 10035.02s]  If you if you beads it before it actually pulls it will like it'll still pull them if you beat it like way
[10035.02s -> 10036.38s]  Or like it fell
[10036.38s -> 10040.13s]  Yeah, the whole thing you're falling off the beads are falling off. Okay interesting
[10040.61s -> 10041.81s]  so
[10041.81s -> 10047.66s]  You pull and then sure forwards your ulti dragging in a line that does a bunch of damage
[10048.22s -> 10050.85s]  Okay over issues right now
[10051.09s -> 10052.61s]  I'm just trying to figure out right now
[10052.61s -> 10055.97s]  What i'm trying to figure out is a combination kind of like overwatch, right?
[10055.97s -> 10061.49s]  We're like zarya hanzo like so you pull and then I ult because my ult does damage and it silences
[10061.81s -> 10067.07s]  So they can't beads or anything and then you you dragon. Are you talking to me? Because I zoned out
[10070.96s -> 10072.96s]  You need to get your head in the game
[10075.92s -> 10079.57s]  What did you say
[10080.53s -> 10082.53s]  You don't even remember what you said bro
[10085.81s -> 10087.97s]  This is where we go five winstons in the middle, yeah
[10089.41s -> 10096.72s]  Okay
[10096.72s -> 10102.32s]  What oh boy, what the heck you pull pull I ult he dragons
[10103.97s -> 10109.97s]  Yeah, wait if you silence your ult silences, right? Yes my ult silences so I can silence into the
[10110.21s -> 10115.41s]  Wait, that means they can't beads right? Yeah, no, they can I think you can still beads when you're silenced
[10116.91s -> 10118.91s]  Yeah, that's just stupid. What's the point of silencing?
[10119.55s -> 10124.67s]  So you can't use abilities because they're not you you don't use them all together usually like if they get pulled drop your shit
[10124.75s -> 10128.03s]  Where they get pulled but you're kind of using them separately to make them beads
[10128.59s -> 10130.59s]  So one of your all shit is
[10130.91s -> 10134.67s]  Wait, that makes sense. Yeah, you can beads while you're silenced right somebody's saying that
[10135.63s -> 10136.51s]  Yeah
[10136.51s -> 10142.59s]  The order that you sent me, uh, we can is that the order that I build in? Yes, exactly. Okay. All right
[10149.70s -> 10151.70s]  Tyrus servers getting ddos right now
[10153.22s -> 10159.62s]  I don't think they're getting ddos. Maybe there's so many people playing right now that I think they they're fixing them. They just reset
[10160.34s -> 10163.98s]  Is this normal in spite? Yes
[10164.54s -> 10166.54s]  Every night while i'm streaming it up
[10168.14s -> 10173.50s]  Every night. Yeah ever since like uh, like coven when everyone started playing like smite's player base double
[10173.58s -> 10178.94s]  They I think it's a code problem with their logins and they can't even fix it. Oh spaghetti code. Yep
[10180.29s -> 10182.61s]  Because the games don't crash like if i'm in a game i'm fine
[10183.17s -> 10187.65s]  I'm not in a booster seat. I'm not in a booster seat in the picture. I have that's a herman miller
[10188.29s -> 10191.01s]  Embodied chair and it's fucking phenomenal. Okay
[10193.84s -> 10197.36s]  Everyone's saying i'm in a booster seat. No, that's that's i'm in that's a herman miller
[10197.86s -> 10201.14s]  Well, we can't tell because there's a giant black box by herman miller
[10202.05s -> 10206.93s]  Uh, no, they gave me the chair, but those chairs suck. I like the embody
[10208.29s -> 10209.65s]  Those chairs suck
[10209.65s -> 10213.25s]  Why are you saying that have you sat in one arm rests their arm rests are doggers
[10214.56s -> 10220.64s]  I like the aaron arm rests more than I like the embodies because the aaron has like that cushion that little squishy squishy
[10221.04s -> 10224.96s]  I I I think the doesn't I like the the back crank the thing where you go like
[10226.16s -> 10229.84s]  And maybe tighter. Yeah. No, I love it. That was asmr spark
[10230.80s -> 10233.68s]  No, I love it. I think it's great. Yeah, but can anyone purr?
[10235.42s -> 10237.42s]  I don't think anyone's gonna want to do that
[10237.98s -> 10239.98s]  I
[10240.22s -> 10243.10s]  I'm not sure anybody's gonna want to do those sounds
[10245.02s -> 10248.75s]  We should try joining now apparently are we all right? We can do it. Yeah
[10249.49s -> 10255.15s]  All right. So we're let's go for it. All right play are you guys ready?
[10256.50s -> 10258.42s]  I just chugged some water

[10263.84s -> 10270.08s]  I think it's tectones if he ever puts it up. What's tectone? Oh, okay. I don't know what I don't know is in game
[10275.66s -> 10277.66s]  We're on the broadcast. Oh

[10296.90s -> 10299.46s]  Where's that freaking yoked up germa? I saw in the picture
[10302.18s -> 10304.18s]  Yoked up. All right. Wait, do you mean like
[10305.15s -> 10308.51s]  Never heard that before. Yeah. Yeah, I don't I wouldn't say yoked up. I'd say more
[10309.07s -> 10311.07s]  Like cottage cheesed up
[10314.91s -> 10316.67s]  I didn't see any drooping
[10316.67s -> 10326.69s]  I'm sitting in a chair. Yeah, but you know, like old people have like their skin starts sagging. I got pretty good posture to anything
[10328.27s -> 10335.07s]  I'd have to relook
[10335.07s -> 10336.67s]  What's wrong with you?
[10336.67s -> 10344.96s]  But I don't know where to start deep right now two green teas. I'm too

[10379.84s -> 10383.92s]  Yeah, usually ipad I have an ipad on my chest and I just kind of watch whatever and then fall asleep
[10385.98s -> 10388.45s]  Really? Yeah
[10388.45s -> 10390.85s]  Let's say when he walks in the room. Just find you like they can wake you up

[10392.05s -> 10395.66s]  Yeah, I mean that you think that picture was weird this pictures of me
[10395.90s -> 10400.24s]  I'll sleep with just random videos of the shit that we've shown. All right, I think we're good to go
[10400.24s -> 10405.74s]  But where where is the match? Are they trying to get you guys to make oh are we making the game?
[10406.54s -> 10413.98s]  We're supposed to be second pick so I don't know why you'd be making the game unless I don't see their name
[10416.19s -> 10419.42s]  I see I see. I remember this game. It's uh stripping is the host
[10419.90s -> 10423.09s]  Okay, so it's stripping is that the same password?

[10437.46s -> 10439.95s]  um, yeah, um
[10440.43s -> 10444.83s]  Uh, I'm trying to think of something funny to say but I don't I don't want to even be somewhat similar
[10445.39s -> 10450.83s]  You know, I guess the password like 12 years ago to like a league of legends tournament that was streamed
[10451.95s -> 10456.83s]  yeah, I was like tsm versus clg and I I got in it was like a random like a
[10457.55s -> 10461.79s]  Alienware tournament and I got in and they didn't kick me out and I played I I cannot join
[10462.59s -> 10469.54s]  I cannot join that game. By the way, did you play for I think clg and I went against tsm. Yeah
[10471.86s -> 10475.22s]  No one on clg went like hey, that's not our player bruce
[10475.70s -> 10477.70s]  When I do password and hit go
[10479.62s -> 10484.42s]  They didn't give a fuck but I just you might need a relog or remake your party remake the party
[10488.42s -> 10490.66s]  All right restart the game

[10514.24s -> 10516.24s]  Did you post in the chat? Okay
[10516.56s -> 10518.56s]  Wait, wait. Oh my god
[10520.78s -> 10523.18s]  That's how exactly how I imagined you would look like
[10525.17s -> 10531.49s]  Like what do you mean? Like like sleeping with uh, I guess a computer like a computer like on your on your chest
[10531.81s -> 10535.01s]  Is that the juicer? I thought it would fall over though
[10536.32s -> 10540.96s]  You just because you stay completely still I get I must I just I just like do like I could do like a corpse
[10540.96s -> 10542.96s]  And just don't move. That's kind of weird

[10815.79s -> 10817.44s]  How do I see this?
[10817.44s -> 10820.48s]  No, I don't know. Can you poop? Yeah. Yeah, I think I want to poop
[10821.04s -> 10823.04s]  Oh, no, do you have a bidet?
[10823.76s -> 10828.80s]  Pending party invite no code. Do you have a bidet? I don't have a bidet yet. Oh just shut on them
[10829.44s -> 10835.30s]  I'll shower. I'll shower too. I was just gonna say because if you just swear to while you're pooping it you poop faster
[10835.70s -> 10836.66s]  What?
[10836.66s -> 10838.02s]  Why?
[10838.02s -> 10841.86s]  Why am I not seeing your invite man? It says you have a pending invite from somebody
[10843.04s -> 10845.04s]  Can you like clear your invites or something?
[10847.04s -> 10849.76s]  uh
[10849.76s -> 10851.76s]  There we go. All right. So now you know, uh
[10852.16s -> 10856.99s]  All right, I'm joining join offer. That was weird. It's a black screen. Uh, yeah
[10857.07s -> 10861.49s]  It's got to stay that way for a little bit. All right new uh new lobbies up. We're good
[10862.61s -> 10868.46s]  We're not good. No, cuz I hear this tournament relies on us right now. We need to stall forever
[10870.86s -> 10879.97s]  All right. I'm reading power of god right now. Okay. Um, here we go. Does it work password is
[10880.78s -> 10882.99s]  bacon and
[10883.07s -> 10885.63s]  Eggs, dude, you're muted. You're not muted
[10888.38s -> 10900.59s]  All right, we're in all right. I'm gonna take this opportunity to get maybe one half green tea
[10902.05s -> 10908.85s]  I'll be right back. Yeah, half with with sugar sugar spice and everything nice, dude
[10908.93s -> 10914.66s]  There's no green tea. He's just taking a massive bong hit. That's the poke method
[10919.79s -> 10921.79s]  Jerma smokes bongs
[10922.03s -> 10937.52s]  Would you believe it? Okay, everyone muted dude. I always I keep zoning out. I don't know why yeah, because i'm not jerma
[10939.01s -> 10942.93s]  Yeah, that's exactly it actually poke. I hate hearing your fucking voice. You're so stupid
[10943.33s -> 10946.61s]  And honestly, i'm gonna punch you in your face next time I see you. Is that what you wanted to hear?
[10946.69s -> 10950.29s]  You can't even reach me bro taller than your ass. Okay, that was kind of weird
[10950.85s -> 10955.18s]  That was actually really rude. Well, he's not here. You're gonna physically hurt me
[10956.42s -> 10960.74s]  I'd say you will be hurt. Did I say that? I don't think I said you will be hurt
[10960.90s -> 10969.14s]  You said you're gonna punch me dude. You're acting crazy. I'm twitch reporting you partner on partner. That's fucked up
[10969.70s -> 10980.18s]  I got you chill chill. Okay, let's do this, baby. I just searched. Yeah
[10986.50s -> 10989.70s]  That first character they picked has a bit of alt that sucks you into them
[10990.26s -> 10992.42s]  Um, and then two damaging abilities and a root
[10994.10s -> 11000.02s]  He's all ranged. It's mad. I mean all those guys i'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm here seem like they play smile. I'm good. I'm good
[11005.10s -> 11007.10s]  I had to cut my poop short
[11007.74s -> 11010.86s]  No, i'm good. Huh? I fucking I'm
[11011.26s -> 11013.26s]  Did you still have some inside of you or something?
[11013.82s -> 11019.90s]  Yes, I I popped the stream open. I was like, I wonder if we're gonna start soon and I fucking I knew how to pick
[11021.58s -> 11024.22s]  Why don't you just that's the type of player we like
[11025.10s -> 11027.10s]  Now i'm gonna play insane because I need to poop
[11027.82s -> 11029.42s]  Wait, you didn't poop
[11029.42s -> 11035.58s]  I like half poop. Hey, honestly man. This is uh, this is a hundred thousand dollar tournament just shit in your pants
[11035.66s -> 11038.58s]  You can buy a new fucking pair of pants
[11038.58s -> 11041.74s]  That's a good point
[11041.74s -> 11046.78s]  Like if if we're in the middle of the last team fight and we might win the tournament you could buy a new rug myself
[11048.08s -> 11050.16s]  Who's better here uler or artemis?
[11051.30s -> 11057.54s]  I mean, you're better with artemis as well. You don't know that you don't know that you don't know that you're warmed. You're warmed
[11061.41s -> 11062.77s]  You don't know that
[11062.77s -> 11065.50s]  This guy's turtle heading bro
[11065.50s -> 11067.50s]  And there's a turtle on the other team. Ew
[11067.82s -> 11069.82s]  Dude, I see
[11070.94s -> 11073.02s]  You would genuinely play better if you just let it all go
[11073.42s -> 11076.67s]  Is that just me
[11077.31s -> 11084.43s]  Like you were saying earlier kali jungle. Yeah, but but that's for peeing for pooping. It's different like you're
[11085.07s -> 11087.07s]  You keister that you're not gonna feel good
[11090.22s -> 11092.30s]  Is this uh, if we lose how many more games we have?
[11093.18s -> 11095.18s]  This is the last one
[11095.90s -> 11100.14s]  You win you keep going. I think if you lose you're done, but there's no like website or anything to check
[11101.18s -> 11104.06s]  Is uh, I guess anybody out already or two in one win?
[11104.62s -> 11108.69s]  I think you go to semis and then the winner that goes to finals
[11111.54s -> 11118.72s]  All right, how many teams even are in this tournament? Yeah, is anybody out already or I don't I don't I'm sure somebody is
[11119.52s -> 11123.68s]  I think there's four no. Well, if someone's oh and two they have to be out of four. There's two groups of four
[11124.24s -> 11130.80s]  And there's four people per group
[11130.80s -> 11137.92s]  Yep, so if we come in like fourth or fifth place, that means we get we still we're still um able to get maybe like
[11138.56s -> 11141.33s]  three to four dollars each, right?
[11141.33s -> 11166.64s]  Oh
[11166.64s -> 11170.08s]  What are you just beat is oh and two so they're done and snuffy's team is done
[11171.50s -> 11173.66s]  What is baron's
[11173.66s -> 11175.58s]  other abilities beside his ult
[11175.58s -> 11179.98s]  Uh, his two is a circle and if it hits on you it will heal his team and does damage to you
[11180.46s -> 11185.82s]  Is one is like a crisscross line ability that does damage and then his three he throws it out if it hits you
[11185.82s -> 11187.90s]  It sticks to you and slows you and then roots you up for a second
[11189.02s -> 11191.02s]  Who am I playing against collie?
[11191.10s -> 11193.10s]  You're gonna be against that bear in the top guy
[11193.90s -> 11197.42s]  Is he what is oh that's which that or you're gonna be against the turtle
[11197.90s -> 11203.98s]  One of the other which one's what does he do to bite it? So if the the top guy's a mate or the bottom guy
[11204.22s -> 11209.50s]  There and he's a mage. Um, like I said, he suck you in results. He has damaging abilities and he has a root
[11209.82s -> 11213.18s]  Um, he doesn't have any movement though. Like he can't like blink away or anything like that
[11214.70s -> 11217.10s]  Yeah, the turtle has a dash and if he hits you he can push you
[11217.42s -> 11222.14s]  His ultimate will knock you up a bunch of times and then he has a little turtle he can throw you
[11222.86s -> 11227.66s]  And he has an ability that will make him glow and if he glows he reflects damage like if you auto him
[11227.66s -> 11231.90s]  It'll reflect damage. Oh, so I shouldn't hit him when he glows. Yeah, it also lowers his cooldown. All right
[11231.90s -> 11233.90s]  I gotta go. Good luck boys. Good luck
[11234.54s -> 11237.26s]  Oh, let's do it. What do you mean? Good luck. We need the luck not him
[11238.78s -> 11243.34s]  Well, he has to watch us. Oh, that's true. I think we're gonna we're in a good position here. I think
[11244.30s -> 11249.26s]  Why is everyone's like border so cool? I'm nervous because they play the character a lot
[11250.22s -> 11252.94s]  That guy has 2016 smite what
[11253.98s -> 11257.34s]  I have beta tester bro. Oh, never mind. We're chilling. Yeah
[11258.30s -> 11260.30s]  I was actually in the alpha of this game
[11261.34s -> 11264.94s]  Is that legit or are you just saying that it's like a legitimately different game now?
[11266.22s -> 11268.22s]  This is unfair matchmaking
[11269.25s -> 11273.09s]  Yeah, they couldn't change the teams because why don't we just have germa play anubis?
[11274.05s -> 11278.05s]  I mean, I I have a diamond level 10 anubis. I'm surprised
[11279.30s -> 11280.18s]  So
[11280.18s -> 11283.78s]  I've had that that's not I didn't make a joke or anything. What did I say? That was funny. No, I know
[11284.74s -> 11286.58s]  it's just
[11286.58s -> 11290.74s]  It was diamond level 10 anubis. Like the game would have been over if I was on anubis
[11290.82s -> 11292.82s]  I just don't understand why that's a funny joke. That's
[11293.38s -> 11295.38s]  That's not it. I wasn't trying to be funny
[11296.98s -> 11301.14s]  Sometimes that's the best way to be funny isn't it when you're not even trying to it is mildly funny
[11301.22s -> 11303.78s]  Especially since sure for is laughing. It does make me want to laugh
[11304.66s -> 11309.62s]  See see sure for does have a contagious laugh. Thank you. I'll let everyone laugh. I'm smiling
[11310.18s -> 11314.12s]  Hey, by the way, I went I I practiced yesterday in the afternoon with anubis
[11314.88s -> 11320.16s]  And just like oh just in case maybe I might play it didn't know what I had no idea what the setup was going to be
[11320.72s -> 11323.60s]  Um, I didn't land one mummify in five games
[11324.40s -> 11328.48s]  Oh, it was awful. So I was like, oh shit. Hopefully I don't have to play this character
[11329.49s -> 11331.49s]  Well, I guess it worked out
[11331.49s -> 11335.89s]  Yeah, wait, he said buy deaths deaths embraces something else that's toll
[11337.01s -> 11342.69s]  And transcend death's toll. He has it. He has it in the discord. It's death's toll and morningstar morningstar. That's what it was
[11343.49s -> 11345.49s]  Oh, yeah, you and folk have the same build
[11347.82s -> 11349.76s]  All right, you guys ready?

[12795.22s -> 12798.42s]  We're no problem
[12798.42s -> 12800.42s]  It's a reasonable. Sorry
[12800.50s -> 12802.90s]  It's all right. I'll do a lot with it. I promise
[12803.46s -> 12805.47s]  I believe me
[12805.47s -> 12808.05s]  All right, what's left side? Is there anything left side that's up right now?
[12809.01s -> 12812.53s]  Um, we could try to do what the pyro is up in a minute
[12813.41s -> 12815.90s]  We need to ward it. We need to ward it. Yeah
[12816.86s -> 12818.86s]  They're going mid we should do something mid
[12820.53s -> 12823.89s]  They're doing they're doing one of the camps in the middle. They're getting ready for pyro careful
[12824.53s -> 12827.86s]  I'm trying to get as much xp as I can right now
[12828.34s -> 12835.07s]  Can we kill this?
[12835.07s -> 12837.07s]  They're definitely setting up for pyro for sure
[12837.79s -> 12839.79s]  I don't have a ward right now though
[12839.79s -> 12841.23s]  I got a ward up there
[12841.23s -> 12843.47s]  There's a ward up there
[12845.06s -> 12847.06s]  I'll clear left left. Okay

[12853.52s -> 12855.52s]  We need that we need that
[12857.01s -> 12863.38s]  His all makes so he can't die. Well, he has turned to mirror all in that all
[12864.96s -> 12867.20s]  So if we don't have a stun or something they can just run
[12869.22s -> 12872.02s]  Yeah, they're all hanging out here. No, it was alt for alt. Yeah
[12873.46s -> 12875.62s]  I think they I think they want to do pyro

[12896.45s -> 12899.26s]  God damn it
[12900.77s -> 12902.77s]  Yeah, I tried to flash away
[12902.77s -> 12904.77s]  Oh my god, I died so fast
[12905.57s -> 12908.85s]  I got picked by the turtle. I couldn't move and I got melted
[12909.89s -> 12912.51s]  I don't even know what happened to me
[12917.20s -> 12924.85s]  They were getting noob stomped by a kali right now for two weeks and the team was announced like what a week ago cheaters confirmed
[12925.33s -> 12929.62s]  Before I don't want to buy
[12929.62s -> 12931.62s]  Fuck me

[12939.78s -> 12944.43s]  We did come back we have we still want to get money, yep
[12953.60s -> 12955.60s]  They're all level 20 and we're not even close
[12956.16s -> 12961.28s]  What we need to do is one win one team fight
[12961.92s -> 12964.64s]  Yeah, that's all matter. It's like an hour fun for an hour. We good
[12965.44s -> 12968.24s]  Just farm for an hour under towers. You can just enter towers
[12970.30s -> 12973.66s]  Yeah, the fire giant really was a was a big a big negative
[12976.58s -> 12978.58s]  We lost our momentum after the fire giant
[12983.34s -> 12985.34s]  Imagine if we got it farm for an hour
[12986.62s -> 12987.98s]  What is this thing?
[12987.98s -> 12999.20s]  I didn't buy awards
[12999.20s -> 13001.34s]  They're in mid right now
[13001.34s -> 13003.34s]  Three minutes take this gold fury
[13004.75s -> 13009.31s]  Mid yeah, they kill mid three in mid right now. I'm pushing it. I'm pushing it four in mid right now
[13009.47s -> 13011.47s]  They're in the tower right now
[13012.35s -> 13014.35s]  We met just four they're all here
[13015.39s -> 13017.39s]  Every single person's here. They destroyed the tower
[13018.75s -> 13020.75s]  They're coming in. They're coming into the jungle coming to the jungle
[13021.62s -> 13026.72s]  I'm here. I'm here. I'm pulling them from the jungle one on me. Fuck it. I'm taking them
[13028.24s -> 13032.51s]  I'm died
[13032.51s -> 13034.99s]  Holy fuck cali can't die in a roll. So
[13038.27s -> 13040.35s]  Holy shit, what's going on fair match making out there?
[13041.47s -> 13042.75s]  ggs
[13042.75s -> 13046.35s]  Oh, it's not over yet. It's not over. It's not over. I don't know. I'm just i'm just uh
[13047.23s -> 13057.14s]  Just saying things
[13057.14s -> 13067.22s]  I gotta heal same i'm so close
[13074.38s -> 13078.94s]  Once we get even in gold and xp, we have a better team fight than them
[13080.94s -> 13084.14s]  Yeah, they're mid gold the gold series is just gold right nice luck. Yeah, we're better
[13085.15s -> 13087.15s]  i'm just gonna wait for my item then because
[13087.23s -> 13090.37s]  What else am I gonna do at this point?
[13090.37s -> 13092.37s]  I got I need eight gold
[13093.01s -> 13094.53s]  Collapse kevin
[13094.53s -> 13097.81s]  So that's what I just said. We just sit under tower and fucking
[13102.34s -> 13105.38s]  We just have to kite them or wait for big air results
[13107.86s -> 13111.94s]  Because if you forced too much the colleagues just gonna press r and not that
[13116.16s -> 13118.16s]  Russell you're gonna make the game when you play russell
[13119.04s -> 13121.04s]  I am going to try my best
[13121.36s -> 13126.51s]  Tried to eat that guy, but it didn't work trying to catch up in levels and xp
[13133.54s -> 13135.70s]  All right. Let's uh, let's group up somewhere
[13136.98s -> 13140.02s]  They're they're they're right here. I'll get the buff here. They're all right here
[13141.70s -> 13145.68s]  Oh fuck
[13145.68s -> 13150.16s]  I'm like holy shit that her fucking hurts. I'm out. I think we should be trying to run
[13153.63s -> 13155.63s]  I
[13159.07s -> 13161.07s]  If we die here it's over
[13165.07s -> 13167.07s]  If we die here it's over
[13172.74s -> 13183.12s]  I mean I can wave clear fuck they're in mid right now three in mid
[13186.59s -> 13188.59s]  I have all
[13196.06s -> 13200.78s]  I have good wave clear so they can't push too much. It's gonna be hard for them to get into the phoenix air
[13201.58s -> 13204.06s]  They're all going left though. They're probably gonna get that left tower
[13204.78s -> 13215.20s]  I'm up in four. I'm with you sure for
[13215.92s -> 13220.99s]  Yeah, they're on left
[13220.99s -> 13223.39s]  What the fuck they got that siege tower, too
[13224.27s -> 13229.90s]  Okay, they all use their fucking
[13230.53s -> 13232.85s]  Thing anybody low are they low these beads?
[13233.49s -> 13235.28s]  No beads
[13235.28s -> 13238.40s]  I could jump on top right now and just say fuck it. Whatever. I'm gonna hit the trebuchet
[13243.09s -> 13245.09s]  My ult's up in 42 seconds
[13245.25s -> 13247.25s]  Two of them use their their beads
[13248.64s -> 13250.88s]  Don't push up too hard because I don't know where they are. I don't need
[13253.46s -> 13259.02s]  All right, I got full stack here. It's a lot of them don't have beads anymore. That'll be good for the next fight
[13261.07s -> 13262.59s]  Oh, I didn't want that
[13262.59s -> 13266.19s]  Are they uh, they're not doing fire turn or anything. They're doing they're doing it go go go go go go go
[13266.19s -> 13268.19s]  This is where we do it. Oh, that's bad
[13270.32s -> 13272.32s]  Don't die now
[13278.24s -> 13283.20s]  We just wait this out then that was the chance I went in like I actually caught some they're also low
[13283.84s -> 13285.84s]  I wasn't there
[13285.84s -> 13287.84s]  We were all we were all just barely out
[13289.84s -> 13294.80s]  Honestly, I'm pretty tall we may have uh, we may have gotten in
[13295.60s -> 13298.80s]  It's possible. We would have gotten in and killed somebody but if they killed devire giant we're all
[13301.92s -> 13304.16s]  Yeah, which is really fine. Yeah. Yeah
[13305.44s -> 13307.44s]  So we just have to play slow again
[13308.18s -> 13310.48s]  They're all up here
[13310.48s -> 13314.24s]  At least one of them i'm going to buy i'm gonna go buy real quick might as well
[13314.56s -> 13319.68s]  Yeah, go finish your bills if you have I think everybody just go buy. Yeah, i'm buying words to finish your bills if you have any
[13320.32s -> 13327.02s]  We need a water jungle really bad
[13327.58s -> 13329.44s]  You're dead
[13329.44s -> 13331.36s]  Oh my god, I am
[13331.36s -> 13332.56s]  Yeah
[13332.56s -> 13334.88s]  We have to play by the tier threes. Sorry
[13336.24s -> 13343.73s]  Yeah, I mean at least my death isn't that bad
[13344.13s -> 13346.05s]  No, it is pretty bad
[13346.05s -> 13348.05s]  They can yeah, because they're on an initiator
[13348.45s -> 13352.98s]  Yeah, okay
[13352.98s -> 13355.54s]  I think they're I think they're gonna go for it here
[13356.34s -> 13362.34s]  Oh, yeah, they are. Yep. I'm dead. They're just fucking aping me. Yeah
[13362.98s -> 13364.98s]  Sorry guys
[13368.16s -> 13370.16s]  No, the sander tower sander tower
[13378.14s -> 13381.02s]  Yeah, kali's invincible with the owner
[13381.98s -> 13383.98s]  Yep, she's a noob stomper
[13391.81s -> 13394.11s]  They're hacking
[13394.11s -> 13395.79s]  That was so hard
[13395.79s -> 13396.67s]  Yeah
[13396.67s -> 13399.81s]  I don't think i'm doing enough
[13399.81s -> 13401.33s]  I definitely was not
[13401.33s -> 13406.13s]  Dude, i'm telling you the odds are stacked against us because otk tournament and they want tectone to win
[13406.94s -> 13407.98s]  gg
[13407.98s -> 13410.40s]  They had four sumi pros and tectone
[13411.02s -> 13413.02s]  Sure, it's an nt. What the heck
[13413.42s -> 13419.01s]  I'm kidding. I'm just maybe we get more magic damage. Don't don't we get more magic damage? Oh
[13419.41s -> 13424.85s]  That wouldn't have changed anything. I'm magic. They even hired the fire dragon to get I was just dead half the time
[13425.49s -> 13431.39s]  the fire giant
[13431.39s -> 13436.30s]  Wow, well
[13436.30s -> 13441.10s]  Um gg guys, I guess, you know, it was a good try wasn't it? Wait, wait, we're done
[13441.74s -> 13444.51s]  Yeah, yeah, we're out. Where's our coach?
[13445.98s -> 13448.46s]  He's giving up on us. He doesn't even want to hear from us
[13449.90s -> 13451.90s]  I think
[13452.62s -> 13454.62s]  Oh tiebreaker
[13455.50s -> 13459.10s]  We might have another chance do we have another chance for the for the hundred million dollars
[13459.82s -> 13464.66s]  I think the tiebreaker is like the wind speed though, like whoever won the fastest out of all three of you guys
[13464.74s -> 13466.74s]  So I don't know who that is
[13467.62s -> 13471.17s]  We got noob stomp by kali. I forgot her alt makes her unkillable
[13471.63s -> 13477.63s]  Well, you guys like we're actually fragging until you all died to the fire giant. Yeah, that was the turning point that that was like
[13478.59s -> 13481.79s]  If we uh, I think we probably would have won the game if we didn't die there
[13481.79s -> 13485.31s]  If you had done the fire before like a couple times you guys wouldn't have died to it
[13485.39s -> 13487.39s]  It was just because you guys didn't know
[13487.63s -> 13490.27s]  That would have been a nuts call. Like you would have just won the game that early, too
[13492.19s -> 13496.11s]  Well, what happened was they started without me and then they also ran away. Yeah
[13496.75s -> 13498.51s]  I didn't even know
[13498.51s -> 13502.51s]  I I was in I died first. I I was in there with 40% health and just died
[13503.15s -> 13507.71s]  I tried to jump away with like 10% health and just got instantly killed. That's all right
[13509.06s -> 13511.22s]  If we win the tiebreaker, we're still freaking going strong
[13511.94s -> 13517.52s]  That would be I need to put can I pick something that hits like hits harder maybe more cc like
[13518.16s -> 13520.64s]  Uh, yeah, we can we can give you something else if there's another game
[13522.11s -> 13524.11s]  Oh, yeah, true. If there's another game
[13525.63s -> 13532.35s]  That baron dude was nuts. He was just bragging me out like just sucking me in and pulling everybody in he was kind of tanky, too
[13533.31s -> 13536.77s]  Yeah
[13536.77s -> 13538.77s]  Dude that kali was just
[13539.17s -> 13541.17s]  Oh, yeah running through us
[13541.81s -> 13550.38s]  Yeah, you you forget that it's like oh my god, i'm gonna kill the kali. No, she's invincible for like 10 seconds
[13551.02s -> 13552.74s]  Yeah
[13552.74s -> 13564.46s]  And even your brain is still just like why why is why won't she die? I'm hurting her they hacked
[13569.74s -> 13571.74s]  They were aim locking
[13571.98s -> 13581.28s]  and wall hacking
[13581.28s -> 13583.94s]  Yeah, so what's the uh,
[13583.94s -> 13586.34s]  What's the what's the what's the story now? We're waiting for in the game
[13586.34s -> 13592.26s]  The top teams are playing for the championship like the teams are the best records and then I don't know who's playing for second or
[13592.42s -> 13593.38s]  Who's playing for third?
[13593.38s -> 13594.34s]  Hmm
[13594.34s -> 13606.98s]  They're talking about it. I think we just have to wait and see gamers
[13614.85s -> 13617.98s]  Well, it's fun at least
[13618.06s -> 13620.16s]  Yeah fun
[13620.16s -> 13622.16s]  We gotta see you naked
[13622.16s -> 13623.87s]  That's true
[13623.87s -> 13628.10s]  Yeah, that's a good time
[13628.10s -> 13634.24s]  Just blame Russell move on that was definitely my adc's fault
[13638.38s -> 13639.82s]  adc's are just
[13639.82s -> 13641.82s]  I did throw i'm sorry
[13641.90s -> 13645.18s]  Adc's are weak bro. You know how it works. Sorry Russell
[13647.20s -> 13653.60s]  No, wait, we we just we just injected steroids and just screamed and we were just going crazy and then just ran
[13653.92s -> 13655.92s]  Straight as fast as we could into a brick wall
[13657.04s -> 13660.32s]  Yeah, there was a fire giant. It was just like I could fucking do anything
[13661.84s -> 13664.80s]  With the hype behind fucking pokes voice too. He was like
[13666.72s -> 13671.28s]  I thought we could have done I think I think we can we could have done it but we did it bad
[13671.92s -> 13673.92s]  Wait, no, we could have we
[13674.48s -> 13677.68s]  Screaming fire giant like we're just doing a fucking ritual and then we just died
[13678.86s -> 13684.62s]  I mean, I feel like we all had so much health for a second and then it just went away fire giant hurt. Yeah
[13689.18s -> 13691.66s]  Hey, I think we did pretty good for a bunch of people. Hey
[13692.38s -> 13697.26s]  How many we haven't played the game in like six or seven years somebody eight years?
[13697.66s -> 13699.98s]  Noco you downloaded the game two hours ago
[13700.93s -> 13705.09s]  Yeah, I think I think we did pretty good. I think we did pretty damn good. No, he didn't
[13705.65s -> 13709.97s]  Yeah, we all did great. Like I think I even outlained like a professional league of legends pro
[13711.06s -> 13713.06s]  I think I think we did really good
[13713.14s -> 13715.14s]  Then I think we could probably get like third place
[13717.18s -> 13719.28s]  I mean russell didn't show up yesterday
[13725.50s -> 13730.13s]  Come on I didn't do bad
[13730.13s -> 13736.77s]  That's copium. Hey, we're allowed to huff copium. We just group b is wait both groups have three o's and then one twos
[13737.41s -> 13739.81s]  Across the board. So wait, are we going to be third place?
[13740.58s -> 13742.58s]  I don't know. Do we get money?
[13742.82s -> 13744.90s]  We might be second
[13744.90s -> 13746.90s]  Bro, we bro we get money
[13747.98s -> 13750.94s]  Wait, no, but that's not the bracket is it are we playing to get in the bracket?
[13751.02s -> 13753.18s]  I don't get it. I honestly don't understand how this is working
[13754.14s -> 13758.50s]  He said whoever loses in the semis, I don't know what the fuck that means. Do we get third?
[13759.22s -> 13761.22s]  So how long from now is that?
[13761.92s -> 13763.92s]  I don't even know
[13764.40s -> 13766.72s]  Wait, do only the top teams from the group play now
[13770.10s -> 13773.14s]  They play for the finals like you're playing the final championship game already
[13773.14s -> 13775.62s]  But there's I guess a loser's like third place
[13779.94s -> 13782.98s]  Oh, I see there's okay 70 years
[13783.30s -> 13790.26s]  There's 3030 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12. Wow. Oh, all right. That's gonna be a shit show to figure out
[13795.90s -> 13797.90s]  That's gonna be an absolute shit show
[13798.30s -> 13801.97s]  Oh, yeah
[13801.97s -> 13805.49s]  Wait, dude, i'm hungry
[13807.73s -> 13810.61s]  I need food. I just need to know if we play more or not
[13811.01s -> 13813.01s]  Yeah, same because if not i'm going to apex
[13820.40s -> 13826.00s]  I thought you were trolling by the way 12 12 12 12 12. Is that troll? Nope. No, it is real
[13826.56s -> 13833.04s]  Those are the numbers. There's only one team really dangerous. There's six teams with one two and there's two teams with three. Oh, huh
[13833.52s -> 13838.88s]  Oh two teams with three. Oh, okay. Yeah two teams three. Oh, can we just all share a third place like that would be fine, right?
[13839.12s -> 13843.12s]  Yeah, wait, that's actually such a good idea. Why doesn't otk just give us all money?
[13843.68s -> 13846.64s]  We're just like hey everybody else lost but you did a good job
[13847.20s -> 13849.44s]  Yeah, I think isn't it? Isn't that basically what twitch rivals is?
[13850.00s -> 13850.72s]  Yeah
[13850.72s -> 13857.95s]  Yeah, I think the only thing good thing about this right now is that it's about the rain. It's about the what the rain
[13858.35s -> 13861.04s]  It's about to rain. Oh
[13862.66s -> 13869.70s]  I love the rain. Oh, could I leave?
[13878.51s -> 13880.51s]  We should get paid for being held hostage
[13880.59s -> 13883.10s]  Honestly true
[13883.10s -> 13888.53s]  I have so much to do guys. I'm very hungry. Wouldn't you have to be a you freaking busy man or something?
[13888.85s -> 13893.57s]  Yeah, I mean, I guess we could I guess we could just like host the main stream and
[13894.13s -> 13899.09s]  Just go you're gonna end stream in I was honestly just trolling. I have nothing. Well, actually yeah, I do I do
[13899.65s -> 13916.75s]  but not like
[13916.75s -> 13923.87s]  Pay us pay us now. Oh because they bet I see they bet on our team winning the whole thing
[13924.80s -> 13929.94s]  Oh, did they actually well, well he's talking about his yeah twitch channel points. Yeah
[13930.66s -> 13933.98s]  I was like damn they really believed in us like that
[13935.98s -> 13937.98s]  I was like, no, I feel like I let everybody down
[13938.93s -> 13944.06s]  Uh, there is definitely not a chance to win the tournament. So I think that is official, right? Yeah
[13945.42s -> 13946.38s]  No
[13946.38s -> 13960.10s]  My fight money. I want to say i'm just really happy that I uh, I knew what buff camps were what i'm proud of you
[13960.42s -> 13962.42s]  I think I think that was a good one
[13962.42s -> 13970.11s]  That was intense. That was fun. Did you get you riled up? I did. I think you guys are done. Yeah, we didn't make it
[13970.75s -> 13972.35s]  No
[13972.35s -> 13974.94s]  Wait, what place did we end up?
[13974.94s -> 13977.90s]  Thank god. Oh man, we're not in the last place. Are we?
[13978.94s -> 13982.78s]  Oh, oh, okay
[13983.34s -> 13986.94s]  How did they even decide who got thrown out? I think we're all last place for playing smite
[13987.10s -> 13991.63s]  I think it was fastest win from our bracket fastest win from the other bracket our freeze
[13994.83s -> 13996.35s]  Our fight money
[13996.43s -> 14004.02s]  I had a reverse monster gg guys. I mean all that matters that we tried our best, right? I was naked on camera today

[14008.90s -> 14011.30s]  Someone took a picture of you. I was literally naked

[14034.88s -> 14039.68s]  He's like, I I could have made money on some other things like I could have made 12k bro
[14040.32s -> 14043.14s]  You give me that you give me a bunch of fucking chumps. Yeah
[14044.50s -> 14053.94s]  That's not like with the losers. All right, did you guys see you later guys? Thanks for playing. All right guys
[14054.70s -> 14061.26s]  That was the uh, that was the tournament. I think we played pretty well fire giant shit that we were I think we were just high
[14061.66s -> 14065.18s]  You know on our own supply
[14065.18s -> 14069.47s]  I think for like I said before a couple people that hadn't really played the game before
[14070.94s -> 14075.26s]  And then the rest of the team hadn't really played that much for years. I think we did pretty well
[14075.26s -> 14078.86s]  I think that was that was a good showing we could have played a lot better obviously, right?
[14078.86s -> 14092.94s]  But whatever it was so fun. It was fun. Yeah, hopefully it was fun to watch
[14093.10s -> 14097.22s]  Yeah, sorry. I wasn't really interacting with the chat at all. I'm trying to at least
[14098.54s -> 14107.28s]  Be somewhat involved in the the call-outs and stuff. But yeah, I I think that's it. That's pretty much all I had planned
[14108.24s -> 14110.96s]  I want to um
[14110.96s -> 14112.96s]  I want to just make sure I reiterate
[14113.22s -> 14116.66s]  The next stream is going to be uh, the green screen stream, which would be the 30th
[14117.49s -> 14122.58s]  I have hundreds of actions i'm going to do in front of the green screen. It should be a fun time
[14122.66s -> 14127.09s]  It always is so see ya in front of see at the green screen stream
[14129.01s -> 14131.81s]  I don't really have a start time, but it's going to be somewhere in the afternoon pacific
[14132.21s -> 14136.51s]  But I want to make sure that i'm ready to go so I don't really have like a hard starting time
[14136.51s -> 14146.32s]  Just so i'll let you know at some point in the afternoon june 30th
[14148.16s -> 14152.40s]  Uh, congratulations or good luck to whoever is going to win this tournament because I mean it's 100k
[14152.48s -> 14159.92s]  It's a lot of money. So good luck. And yeah, I i'm not going to do any really altar or anything
[14160.00s -> 14167.92s]  I just was kind of streaming. So there's another perspective good night. Goodbye
[14168.38s -> 14171.90s]  I'll probably just i'll probably just raid ms gif. I mean that obviously right that makes sense
