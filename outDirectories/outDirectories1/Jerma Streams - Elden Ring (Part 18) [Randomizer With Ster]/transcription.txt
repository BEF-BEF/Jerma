[24.82s -> 26.82s]  Hello, how's everybody doing?
[26.82s -> 30.02s]  Yeah, we're very on time today.
[30.02s -> 32.02s]  That's what happens when you spend
[32.02s -> 34.02s]  two hours troubleshooting
[34.02s -> 36.02s]  mods, and you get it
[36.02s -> 38.02s]  to a point where, wait, oh,
[38.02s -> 41.80s]  he's talking, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[41.80s -> 43.80s]  Three, two, one, what are you doing?
[43.80s -> 45.80s]  Hey, how's it going?
[45.80s -> 47.80s]  Hey, what are you doing?
[47.80s -> 49.80s]  People said they're shocked that we're
[49.80s -> 51.80s]  actually on time today. But what I was saying
[51.80s -> 53.80s]  is, we spent like
[53.80s -> 55.80s]  two hours getting this to work yesterday,
[55.80s -> 57.80s]  so it's gonna work now.
[57.80s -> 59.80s]  Yeah, it works now. We did it.
[59.80s -> 61.80s]  We double checked. We crossed our T's.
[61.80s -> 64.04s]  Everything's good.
[64.04s -> 66.04s]  Your guy needs some pants.
[66.04s -> 68.34s]  How'd you sleep?
[68.34s -> 70.58s]  Not enough.
[70.58s -> 72.58s]  No? Oh, that's right.
[72.58s -> 74.58s]  You got up and went to the gym, right?
[74.58s -> 76.58s]  I did. There was a bit of pumping
[76.58s -> 78.58s]  this morning. I actually got back like
[78.58s -> 80.58s]  an hour ago. Are you serious?
[80.58s -> 83.59s]  Yeah.
[83.59s -> 85.59s]  So you got energy
[85.59s -> 87.59s]  then? You're high energy then?
[87.59s -> 89.59s]  It's the opposite because it's like
[89.59s -> 91.59s]  a two hour session of like
[91.59s -> 93.59s]  now I have no energy.
[93.59s -> 95.59s]  I'm energized for some Elden Ring.
[95.59s -> 97.59s]  Okay. Well, so am I.
[97.59s -> 100.09s]  So you ready? Yeah.
[100.09s -> 102.78s]  What adventure lay forth
[102.78s -> 104.78s]  before a fun this eve?
[104.78s -> 106.78s]  I don't know, but should we
[106.78s -> 109.91s]  get a recap?
[109.91s -> 112.47s]  Sure. Okay. Yeah, because
[112.47s -> 114.47s]  I had imagined people on my stream weren't watching
[114.47s -> 116.47s]  until 2 a.m. last night in the like nine hour
[116.47s -> 118.47s]  ring session. That's really true.
[118.47s -> 120.47s]  So a lot of people that left. Here's a little bit of a recap.
[120.47s -> 124.12s]  Ah!
[124.12s -> 126.12s]  What the fuck?
[126.12s -> 128.94s]  I disconnected.
[128.94s -> 131.30s]  Oh, I'm back.
[131.30s -> 133.30s]  I'll re-invite you.
[133.30s -> 136.12s]  Okay. So that's pretty much
[136.12s -> 138.68s]  all that happened yesterday.
[138.68s -> 140.68s]  We did get
[140.68s -> 143.43s]  up to Ray of Lucaria.
[143.43s -> 145.43s]  But if you don't know, we're doing randomizer.
[145.43s -> 149.13s]  So nothing is
[149.13s -> 151.50s]  the way that it's supposed to be.
[151.50s -> 153.50s]  I don't know randomizer, but every item is randomized
[153.50s -> 155.74s]  and every enemy is randomized.
[155.74s -> 158.10s]  We got stuck with, I don't even
[158.10s -> 160.10s]  know the character's name, Placid
[160.10s -> 162.10s]  Deuce? Placid Deuce?
[162.10s -> 164.10s]  What's the... Placid Deucex
[164.10s -> 166.10s]  is the boss in Reina's...
[166.10s -> 168.10s]  Placid Deucex is the Queen of
[168.10s -> 170.10s]  the Moon. Yes.
[170.10s -> 172.10s]  He's the Queen and he still has two phases
[172.10s -> 174.66s]  and his second phase is Loretta.
[174.66s -> 176.66s]  But him teleporting through walls
[176.66s -> 179.03s]  was hard. We didn't beat it. So we got to
[179.03s -> 181.03s]  farm up. You have like
[181.03s -> 183.03s]  a deleted finger plus six weapon that I
[183.03s -> 185.98s]  can't give you. So we just need...
[185.98s -> 187.98s]  We're going to go around and do some catacombs or
[187.98s -> 189.98s]  like a little mini boss encounter
[189.98s -> 192.28s]  stuff. So we skipped... Honestly we skipped
[192.28s -> 194.28s]  a lot. We basically ran straight to
[194.28s -> 196.46s]  Lucaria. We have to... The wall right now
[196.46s -> 198.46s]  for us is... And we're not
[198.46s -> 200.46s]  going to reset. We're not going to reset. Do you want to know the wall
[200.46s -> 202.46s]  for me? Is that
[202.46s -> 204.46s]  your name is Mestrong and mine is
[204.46s -> 206.46s]  Mesmart because I am the spellcaster.
[206.46s -> 208.95s]  I have no spells.
[208.95s -> 211.58s]  I have not found a spell. You've been
[211.58s -> 213.58s]  casting spells though. It is
[213.58s -> 216.71s]  a weapon art but I don't actually have
[216.71s -> 218.71s]  a spell. But it still scales off of how
[218.71s -> 220.71s]  intelligent you are. You have to be really smart
[220.71s -> 222.71s]  to do it. I want you to be on my side that I
[222.71s -> 224.71s]  haven't got any spells. Like what if I had
[224.71s -> 226.71s]  Crystal Laser Beam Supreme? What if we
[226.71s -> 228.71s]  go into a catacomb and we get Crystal Supreme?
[228.71s -> 231.72s]  Yeah. But what's up with your title by the
[231.72s -> 236.25s]  way? Somebody? I didn't want to name
[236.25s -> 238.25s]  drop. I thought it would be better to just write
[238.25s -> 240.25s]  somebody. I wrote your name.
[240.25s -> 242.25s]  I wrote Sturr.
[242.25s -> 244.49s]  Oh you're going to name drop like that? Like oh you're
[244.49s -> 246.49s]  just going to get all the viewers because all he's playing with Sturr?
[246.49s -> 250.20s]  You know, I will
[250.20s -> 252.89s]  say, years ago
[252.89s -> 254.89s]  that was actually a great
[254.89s -> 257.58s]  idea. Those of you that don't know, back in
[257.58s -> 260.26s]  the TF2 days, Sturr was
[260.26s -> 262.62s]  big, big deal.
[262.62s -> 265.30s]  And if you put Sturr
[265.30s -> 267.30s]  in your title.
[267.30s -> 270.30s]  Alright, I'm playing with Derma.
[270.30s -> 272.30s]  If it was like oh dude, TF2
[272.30s -> 274.30s]  man, TF2 is like such a fun
[274.30s -> 276.30s]  game. Live commentary with
[276.30s -> 278.30s]  Sturr. I'll click this one.
[278.30s -> 285.72s]  A lot of the newer
[285.72s -> 287.72s]  viewers here maybe don't know. Sturr
[287.72s -> 290.20s]  was a TF2.
[290.20s -> 292.44s]  Yeah. If you don't know
[292.44s -> 294.44s]  you're getting the like way
[294.44s -> 296.44s]  washed up Sturr. You don't even know.
[296.44s -> 300.84s]  I don't think so. You don't know what you missed.
[300.84s -> 303.14s]  I think this Sturr
[303.14s -> 305.51s]  is pretty damn good.
[305.51s -> 307.51s]  He's a good guy.
[307.51s -> 309.69s]  All the Sturrs across the last
[309.69s -> 311.69s]  10 to 15 years have been good.
[311.69s -> 313.69s]  He doesn't afraid of anything.
[313.69s -> 315.93s]  No. I like each
[315.93s -> 322.90s]  Sturr. But anyways.
[322.90s -> 324.90s]  Anyways, onto adventure.
[324.90s -> 327.72s]  Did we kill the magmorm?
[327.72s -> 329.72s]  We did kill the magmorm at the urn tree. I know there's
[329.72s -> 331.72s]  down by the beach there's like a sewer
[331.72s -> 334.60s]  we can go down. Oh, by the way, I
[334.60s -> 336.60s]  played off stream and I know a lot of people are going to
[336.60s -> 338.60s]  yell at me. You fucking
[338.60s -> 340.60s]  piece of garbage. You human
[340.60s -> 342.78s]  garbage. But there's a very
[342.78s -> 344.78s]  hold on. I didn't do anything
[344.78s -> 346.78s]  though.
[346.78s -> 349.27s]  Get the fuck out of here!
[349.27s -> 352.79s]  It's one of these things.
[352.79s -> 354.79s]  Did I just hit him across the game?
[354.79s -> 357.80s]  Don't be afraid, man. Hey, hey, come on.
[357.80s -> 359.80s]  Hey, you and me. Hey, you and me. We're starting a new
[359.80s -> 362.04s]  arc right now. Here it is.
[362.04s -> 369.00s]  I'd rather fight a boss.
[369.00s -> 374.06s]  We ain't afraid. Look at that.
[374.06s -> 376.06s]  Alright, that arc is over. We can go on to
[376.06s -> 378.06s]  another one. That was like a pretty good one, I think.
[378.06s -> 380.06s]  Okay. Adventure 2.
[380.06s -> 383.64s]  I think we showed a lot of growth in that.
[383.64s -> 387.14s]  Why is there a golden sheep?
[387.14s -> 389.14s]  Is this rare? What is this? Oh, right.
[389.14s -> 391.14s]  Oh, a lightning sheep. That's right.
[391.14s -> 393.14s]  Okay. I thought there was like a randomizer
[393.14s -> 395.14s]  thing. I also never found where you get
[395.14s -> 399.05s]  that ability. I thought that
[399.05s -> 401.05s]  I thought there's gonna be runes or something.
[401.05s -> 403.35s]  Oh, anyway. Okay. So people ask
[403.35s -> 406.36s]  I may have
[406.36s -> 408.60s]  I just killed I killed the
[408.60s -> 410.60s]  same enemy like 10 times to get
[410.60s -> 412.90s]  some souls because I wanted to
[412.90s -> 414.90s]  get you. You have more levels than
[414.90s -> 416.90s]  me. But if you don't I wanted to buy
[416.90s -> 418.90s]  some smithing stones. What level are you right now?
[418.90s -> 423.19s]  I don't know. Why do you need to
[423.19s -> 425.19s]  I want to know what level you are. What level are you? And then I'll
[425.19s -> 427.19s]  tell you immediately after. I am 37.
[427.19s -> 429.43s]  You are as old as I am.
[429.43s -> 431.43s]  I'm 49.
[431.43s -> 433.43s]  Okay. We evened out.
[433.43s -> 436.44s]  That's like not bad. But anyways
[436.44s -> 438.44s]  I
[438.44s -> 440.44s]  wanted to get stones
[440.44s -> 442.44s]  because
[442.44s -> 444.44s]  a big boy.
[444.44s -> 446.44s]  Oh, yeah.
[446.44s -> 448.68s]  Oh, yeah. I do
[448.68s -> 450.68s]  it all the time. And I think I'm pretty good at making
[450.68s -> 452.68s]  that joke. So I'm gonna do it whenever I get an opportunity
[452.68s -> 458.95s]  to. Let's help this boy.
[458.95s -> 464.63s]  Wait.
[464.63s -> 466.63s]  Could I could could I have duplicated
[466.63s -> 468.63s]  I could have duplicated shit, right?
[468.63s -> 470.63s]  Yeah. Oh my
[470.63s -> 472.63s]  God. All right. That's why we're saying
[472.63s -> 474.63s]  not to do that. I remember
[474.63s -> 476.63s]  it being well, I know this was a long time
[476.63s -> 478.63s]  ago, like a year ago when randomizers
[478.63s -> 480.63s]  burst out all of my
[480.63s -> 482.63s]  duplicating my ship with
[482.63s -> 484.63s]  super glitch. Do we have we have another one of those
[484.63s -> 486.63s]  like poison spitter teleporter
[486.63s -> 488.63s]  pieces of shit on me?
[488.63s -> 491.19s]  It's funny
[491.19s -> 493.19s]  that you said that. I know exactly what that meant.
[493.19s -> 498.87s]  And I'm poisoned.
[498.87s -> 500.87s]  Sorry, just poison is not that bad.
[500.87s -> 513.08s]  You just heal through it.
[513.08s -> 515.08s]  What's that character's name? Royal
[515.08s -> 518.09s]  what's the character's name?
[518.09s -> 520.09s]  The character? The thing that we just saw.
[520.09s -> 523.67s]  That enemy? I have no idea.
[523.67s -> 525.98s]  Royal Revenant.
[525.98s -> 528.86s]  Royal Revenant. That sounds like a League
[528.86s -> 530.86s]  of Legends item.
[530.86s -> 535.27s]  I think the I
[535.27s -> 537.27s]  think this is random. Is it random?
[537.27s -> 539.51s]  You get like an item in here too.
[539.51s -> 541.51s]  I can't remember. Who knows?
[541.51s -> 547.46s]  That felt like it lasted
[547.46s -> 549.46s]  a long time. All right. So what's in here?
[549.46s -> 560.84s]  Oh, look at you.
[560.84s -> 562.84s]  I still haven't found a remembrance.
[562.84s -> 569.69s]  I am so sorry about
[569.69s -> 571.69s]  this. I have to apologize immediately.
[571.69s -> 573.69s]  But I need to get
[573.69s -> 575.69s]  I need to be in a safe spot.
[575.69s -> 577.69s]  Because I
[577.69s -> 579.69s]  auto needs to go outside. Follow
[579.69s -> 582.95s]  me. So I can't really follow
[582.95s -> 584.95s]  you. We're going to the shack. We're going
[584.95s -> 586.95s]  straight up to the shack because there's a merchant here
[586.95s -> 588.95s]  and then you can
[588.95s -> 590.95s]  You can go off and care for your
[590.95s -> 592.95s]  doggy. I don't know where you're going.
[592.95s -> 594.95s]  Straight west.
[594.95s -> 596.95s]  Straight west. The game really does not
[596.95s -> 598.95s]  like sometimes when you get on your horse.
[598.95s -> 600.95s]  I think it's when we transition
[600.95s -> 604.92s]  areas. I don't know. Yeah. You kind
[604.92s -> 606.92s]  of desync for me too. I'll just follow
[606.92s -> 608.92s]  you. I got to let auto up.
[608.92s -> 610.92s]  Let's get to a spot where I can
[610.92s -> 612.92s]  not going to take me long. Maybe
[612.92s -> 615.16s]  less than five minutes.
[615.16s -> 619.58s]  Less than two minutes. Show auto.
[619.58s -> 621.94s]  Maybe. You're good.
[621.94s -> 625.77s]  All right. I'm just going to if I just sit here
[625.77s -> 628.26s]  while that screw anything up. No, you're good.
[628.26s -> 631.08s]  All right. Oh, also I got another
[631.08s -> 634.15s]  sacred tear accidentally. I
[634.15s -> 636.39s]  love that for you.
[636.39s -> 639.06s]  All right. I'll bear it back. I'm just literally
[639.06s -> 641.06s]  going to leave this open. My merchants selling
[641.06s -> 643.06s]  two different seed bed curses.
[643.06s -> 645.82s]  I'm not even going to mute my microphone.
[645.82s -> 647.82s]  I mean, I'll mute it over here. But I just
[647.82s -> 649.82s]  you know what? No, no, no, no. No, I'm going to mute you too.
[649.82s -> 651.82s]  I've
[651.82s -> 653.82s]  learned over the years.
[653.82s -> 655.82s]  Probably a good idea. I don't want to say
[655.82s -> 657.82s]  anything weird, but I'm going to feel pressured like I
[657.82s -> 659.82s]  have to. Any time that you are under
[659.82s -> 661.82s]  pressure to like talk,
[661.82s -> 663.82s]  you just talk and you
[663.82s -> 665.82s]  just you know what? I'm just going to say whatever the fuck
[665.82s -> 667.82s]  I'm going to say. Hey, guys, see
[667.82s -> 669.82s]  that. So I did. He's gone.
[669.82s -> 671.82s]  I got rid of him.
[671.82s -> 673.82s]  I'll be right back. I'm not going to put actually, you know
[673.82s -> 675.82s]  I'm going to put a BRB screen. People can be like, what the hell is going on?
[675.82s -> 1005.34s]  Right back. Yeah.
[1005.34s -> 1013.83s]  Telster.
[1013.83s -> 1016.31s]  It's cringe. Yeah.
[1016.31s -> 1018.31s]  That's the first thing people hear.
[1018.31s -> 1021.88s]  It's cringe. All right. So
[1021.88s -> 1025.08s]  hold on.
[1025.08s -> 1028.92s]  Yeah. Sorry. I had to take Otto out.
[1028.92s -> 1031.29s]  He's good. He's relaxing in the other room.
[1031.29s -> 1033.29s]  Was he and is he
[1033.29s -> 1035.85s]  a good dog? Yes. Okay.
[1035.85s -> 1038.60s]  That's good to know. Of course he is.
[1038.60s -> 1041.74s]  What's the worst thing he's ever
[1041.74s -> 1045.50s]  done? I don't think
[1045.50s -> 1047.99s]  there really is anything. He's
[1047.99s -> 1049.99s]  a really good boy. He is.
[1049.99s -> 1051.99s]  He just, I remember he doesn't
[1051.99s -> 1053.99s]  like do anything. He just kind of chills. He just kind
[1053.99s -> 1055.99s]  of just hangs around. He kind of hangs
[1055.99s -> 1061.62s]  out. Never like pooped in your bed or anything?
[1061.62s -> 1064.70s]  Ate too many Oreos?
[1064.70s -> 1067.13s]  No, my dog has never pooped in my
[1067.13s -> 1069.67s]  bed. Oh, my dog
[1069.67s -> 1071.67s]  has. Bro, your stream title
[1071.67s -> 1075.32s]  is boring. But who
[1075.32s -> 1079.35s]  cares?
[1079.35s -> 1081.35s]  Randomizer gaming with stir.
[1081.35s -> 1083.35s]  See, that's how I felt too. Like just like
[1083.35s -> 1085.35s]  game with name is like the
[1085.35s -> 1087.35s]  worst title. It is, but that's what yours
[1087.35s -> 1090.15s]  is. Yeah, but I, you're
[1090.15s -> 1092.15s]  horsing in place. Okay. Well,
[1092.15s -> 1094.90s]  let's teleport somewhere. Okay.
[1094.90s -> 1098.73s]  Well, I want to, let's teleport to the shack.
[1098.73s -> 1100.73s]  Like, like, let's just actually teleport
[1100.73s -> 1105.85s]  to the shack that we're right next to. New
[1105.85s -> 1111.29s]  title? Name it swag gaming
[1111.29s -> 1117.18s]  with my man. Um,
[1117.18s -> 1119.98s]  I can't, I, again,
[1119.98s -> 1121.98s]  as, again, I was at the gym.
[1121.98s -> 1123.98s]  My brain is gone. I, there is
[1123.98s -> 1125.98s]  no cleverness. Ah, shit, I forgot.
[1125.98s -> 1128.15s]  You know what, do you know what
[1128.15s -> 1131.29s]  I really want? I do.
[1131.29s -> 1133.29s]  I want, I want
[1133.29s -> 1135.53s]  pads
[1135.53s -> 1137.70s]  for my elbows. Your elbows get just
[1137.70s -> 1139.70s]  absolutely fucked up like mine do.
[1139.70s -> 1142.39s]  Sitting in a chair. Uh, I have
[1142.39s -> 1144.39s]  like purchased like elbow
[1144.39s -> 1146.39s]  pads for my chair. Is it, is
[1146.39s -> 1148.39s]  that a, was it worth it? Yes,
[1148.39s -> 1150.63s]  100%. Because when you sit
[1150.63s -> 1152.63s]  here for long enough. I have a double layer.
[1152.63s -> 1156.60s]  I feel like it doesn't matter what kind of chair you
[1156.60s -> 1158.60s]  have. You always, if
[1158.60s -> 1160.60s]  you sit here with your elbows and your forearms
[1160.60s -> 1162.84s]  in the same spot, you kind of get that
[1162.84s -> 1165.08s]  like, you know what I mean? Like
[1165.08s -> 1167.08s]  this part of your elbow. You're gonna get that anyway, but like
[1167.08s -> 1171.82s]  it is way better with the pads.
[1171.82s -> 1173.82s]  Alright, let's move. Let's get started. It's been,
[1173.82s -> 1175.82s]  we've been stalling for 15-20 minutes.
[1175.82s -> 1177.82s]  Where, where do we get elbow pads?
[1177.82s -> 1182.42s]  Up this way? Wait, no, I want it, I
[1182.42s -> 1184.42s]  want it to go, there's like the, the swamp area
[1184.42s -> 1186.42s]  this way. I'm gonna put both headphones
[1186.42s -> 1190.33s]  in just for you. Well, then you're gonna
[1190.33s -> 1192.33s]  speech jam yourself because you can't hear yourself.
[1192.33s -> 1195.40s]  No, I actually, I've actually gotten a little bit better with
[1195.40s -> 1197.58s]  this. Oh, you've been training?
[1197.58s -> 1199.58s]  Yeah, I've been putting both in recently. It still
[1199.58s -> 1201.58s]  kind of sucks, but it's fine.
[1201.58s -> 1213.59s]  Proud of you. Oh, I thought
[1213.59s -> 1216.92s]  there was an enemy in here. You're no
[1216.92s -> 1218.92s]  enemy. Whoa, but there's something here.
[1218.92s -> 1222.76s]  Oh, my God.
[1222.76s -> 1224.76s]  I am so lucky in this
[1224.76s -> 1226.76s]  run. I just got, I got millennia's
[1226.76s -> 1229.69s]  remembrance.
[1229.69s -> 1231.69s]  You fucker. I think mine
[1231.69s -> 1233.69s]  was like a lily, like just a flower.
[1233.69s -> 1236.44s]  That's one of the most expensive ones.
[1236.44s -> 1238.44s]  You should dupe it. Well, let's go clone it.
[1238.44s -> 1240.44s]  No, no, no. Oh, you
[1240.44s -> 1242.44s]  mean dupe it. Yeah, let's go do that. Let's go.
[1242.44s -> 1245.32s]  Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[1245.32s -> 1247.56s]  Saddle up. Oh, my God.
[1247.56s -> 1249.56s]  Is this actually gonna work?
[1249.56s -> 1251.56s]  Yeah. Am I gonna get like a hundred,
[1251.56s -> 1253.56s]  two hundred thousand souls right now? They
[1253.56s -> 1255.56s]  might, like the other one you had, the Radon one
[1255.56s -> 1257.56s]  you had, I think it was, might be reduced
[1257.56s -> 1259.56s]  in the amount. But yeah, you're about
[1259.56s -> 1261.56s]  to fucking. Oh, yes.
[1261.56s -> 1265.98s]  Escalate. Okay.
[1265.98s -> 1271.53s]  Get off the horse.
[1271.53s -> 1275.05s]  I can't get off the horse. I don't
[1275.05s -> 1277.05s]  think the horse is supposed to be able to come in here. I don't
[1277.05s -> 1279.29s]  think so either. Okay, there we
[1279.29s -> 1284.33s]  go. Oh, look at that.
[1284.33s -> 1286.50s]  Let's dupe it. Wait,
[1286.50s -> 1288.50s]  what does it give you if you didn't dupe it?
[1288.50s -> 1290.50s]  What? Who cares?
[1290.50s -> 1292.50s]  I'm curious if the items are, should
[1292.50s -> 1296.28s]  be different. I think it's randomized.
[1296.28s -> 1298.28s]  Give one to stir.
[1298.28s -> 1300.28s]  Give one to stir. No, fuck that.
[1300.28s -> 1304.30s]  This is my shit. Okay.
[1304.30s -> 1306.30s]  I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
[1306.30s -> 1309.18s]  No, use them both. How do you,
[1309.18s -> 1312.50s]  how do you, can I? Can you?
[1312.50s -> 1316.02s]  No, you can't. You cannot do it.
[1316.02s -> 1319.08s]  The true colors.
[1319.08s -> 1321.08s]  I remember this being an issue last time
[1321.08s -> 1323.08s]  and my chat was like, I can't remember.
[1323.08s -> 1325.08s]  But they were like, you can't do it at this one because it's
[1325.08s -> 1327.08s]  too high level of one, but you can do it at the other one.
[1327.08s -> 1329.96s]  I don't know, man.
[1329.96s -> 1331.96s]  Alright, dude, I have, I have a hundred,
[1331.96s -> 1333.96s]  I have a hundred and ten thousand souls.
[1333.96s -> 1336.33s]  Alright, let's go die to like a
[1336.33s -> 1338.33s]  crab or something. Alright, yeah.
[1338.33s -> 1340.33s]  Do you want to go somewhere where it's really dangerous and like
[1340.33s -> 1342.33s]  should we put, want some steaks on this or
[1342.33s -> 1344.89s]  something? Because this is kinda not fair.
[1344.89s -> 1348.15s]  Yeah. There's another cave up
[1348.15s -> 1351.80s]  this way, I'm pretty sure. No, I'm not,
[1351.80s -> 1353.80s]  I'm kidding. We're not doing this. I'm
[1353.80s -> 1356.23s]  gonna go level up. Baby boy.
[1356.23s -> 1359.05s]  Little baby boy.
[1359.05s -> 1361.05s]  Oh my god, look what he's like
[1361.05s -> 1366.86s]  skidding.
[1366.86s -> 1368.86s]  What the fuck, what are you doing?
[1375.18s -> 1377.18s]  I'm trying to do, I'm trying to do my laugh.
[1377.18s -> 1379.80s]  You're trying to do
[1379.80s -> 1381.80s]  your own laugh. Yeah, like that. You're doing an
[1381.80s -> 1383.80s]  impression of yourself laughing.
[1388.01s -> 1390.01s]  Okay, where did you go? Let's teleport back to the shack.
[1390.01s -> 1394.04s]  That was the Joker?
[1397.56s -> 1399.56s]  That was scary. It wasn't
[1399.56s -> 1406.14s]  scary.
[1406.14s -> 1408.63s]  Don't I do that? We're super
[1408.63s -> 1410.63s]  desynced. I just teleported to the shack.
[1410.63s -> 1413.13s]  Did you? I just said to.
[1413.13s -> 1415.13s]  I voted to warp. I voted
[1415.13s -> 1417.30s]  to warp. We're not
[1417.30s -> 1421.40s]  doing it.
[1421.40s -> 1426.46s]  It says it failed. Um, it says
[1426.46s -> 1428.46s]  you are going into the ocean.
[1428.46s -> 1433.56s]  That was very weird. I arrested
[1433.56s -> 1435.56s]  the bonfire. There you are.
[1435.56s -> 1438.18s]  Okay, so this is important
[1438.18s -> 1440.18s]  because I'm about to level up the most,
[1440.18s -> 1442.18s]  this is probably the last amount of levels I'm gonna be able to do
[1442.18s -> 1444.81s]  for this character. It's not true.
[1444.81s -> 1447.69s]  Boom. First of all.
[1447.69s -> 1450.62s]  Okay. You have so much growth
[1450.62s -> 1452.62s]  ahead of you, honey. Okay, here we go.
[1452.62s -> 1460.10s]  I can only level up six times?
[1460.10s -> 1464.06s]  Alright, what's happening
[1464.06s -> 1466.30s]  here? I could do...
[1466.30s -> 1470.18s]  I'll dump it all in strength. Should I
[1470.18s -> 1472.18s]  do intelligence? Without any
[1472.18s -> 1474.49s]  thought, dump it all in strength. All
[1474.49s -> 1476.98s]  in intelligence to be able to use this
[1476.98s -> 1479.29s]  item correctly. Please, for the
[1479.29s -> 1481.29s]  love of God. Please, for the love of God.
[1481.29s -> 1485.45s]  Why does that weapon even need intelligence?
[1485.45s -> 1493.30s]  But wait a minute. Me
[1493.30s -> 1495.30s]  strong is not supposed to be doing this.
[1495.30s -> 1497.30s]  People are pissed right now.
[1497.30s -> 1499.99s]  You're being weird. You're not
[1499.99s -> 1505.82s]  being strong. People are fucking
[1505.82s -> 1510.42s]  pissed off. Alright, well here's the
[1510.42s -> 1513.24s]  deal. Here's the deal.
[1513.24s -> 1515.24s]  If I put
[1515.24s -> 1517.24s]  16 into intelligence, will I be
[1517.24s -> 1519.24s]  able to effectively use this weapon without
[1519.24s -> 1521.24s]  it being just like nerfed in my hands?
[1521.24s -> 1523.61s]  Or do I just
[1523.61s -> 1525.61s]  go boom into strength
[1525.61s -> 1527.61s]  and go upgrade this greatsword thing
[1527.61s -> 1529.91s]  that I have with default shit? Strength.
[1529.91s -> 1531.91s]  Strength. Strength. Strength. Me strong.
[1531.91s -> 1533.91s]  Me strong. Me strong. I'm doing
[1533.91s -> 1535.91s]  intelligence and you're copying me.
[1535.91s -> 1539.24s]  You're copying me. What do you guys think?
[1539.24s -> 1541.93s]  Do you think... 16
[1541.93s -> 1545.69s]  isn't smart. It's not.
[1545.69s -> 1554.06s]  What do you want me to do? I want you to put points
[1554.06s -> 1558.92s]  in vigor, actually. With all of the
[1558.92s -> 1560.92s]  plus to estus flasks you have.
[1560.92s -> 1566.02s]  Yeah. I think...
[1566.02s -> 1568.02s]  That way you don't die in like one hit to placidusax.
[1568.02s -> 1570.02s]  I am gonna do something right now
[1570.02s -> 1572.02s]  and people are gonna be really saying,
[1572.02s -> 1574.02s]  dude, you blew it big time. But
[1574.02s -> 1576.26s]  here's what I'm gonna do. I blew it.
[1576.26s -> 1583.30s]  I blew it big time. I blew it.
[1583.30s -> 1587.21s]  I have to go to the blacksmith
[1587.21s -> 1593.14s]  because I blew it. You blew it?
[1593.14s -> 1595.14s]  Where is the... No.
[1595.14s -> 1597.14s]  No. Not yet. What do you mean not yet?
[1597.14s -> 1599.38s]  Not yet. Hold.
[1599.38s -> 1601.38s]  What are you talking about? While we're here, I wanna do
[1601.38s -> 1603.38s]  one thing while we're here. But look, I have
[1603.38s -> 1605.38s]  this. I can just upgrade this to
[1605.38s -> 1607.38s]  probably plus 10, plus 15 right now because I have
[1607.38s -> 1609.38s]  a bunch of stones. And this is strength.
[1609.38s -> 1611.38s]  You're gonna have to wait. You're gonna learn a lesson
[1611.38s -> 1620.47s]  in patience right now. So let's go.
[1620.47s -> 1630.20s]  Wherever you wanna go. Oh, look. Look. I found
[1630.20s -> 1632.20s]  Millennia's Remembrance. Oh, look. I'm gonna get like
[1632.20s -> 1634.20s]  a plus 10. Oh, look. I have like 10 levels.
[1634.20s -> 1636.57s]  Fuck you, dude.
[1636.57s -> 1638.57s]  Where do you wanna go?
[1638.57s -> 1640.57s]  I wanna go to this graveyard that's like right here
[1640.57s -> 1642.57s]  with a whole bunch of items on it and a dragon guarding it.
[1642.57s -> 1649.74s]  Oh, there is a dragon right there. Okay, cool.
[1649.74s -> 1653.51s]  Let chat seethe.
[1653.51s -> 1656.46s]  Okay. I got like two useless notes
[1656.46s -> 1659.91s]  off of this graveyard. I don't want
[1659.91s -> 1661.91s]  them to seethe, but I think that
[1661.91s -> 1666.46s]  I think it's worth it. He doesn't have a lot of health.
[1666.46s -> 1682.65s]  We're so desynced in this area for
[1682.65s -> 1684.65s]  some reason. It might be just this spot.
[1684.65s -> 1687.21s]  It seems to go in weird cycles
[1687.21s -> 1689.21s]  where we desync, but then we get back to normal
[1689.21s -> 1691.21s]  for like two hours and then it desyncs for like an hour.
[1691.21s -> 1694.15s]  Oops.
[1694.15s -> 1699.34s]  We're fighting it, so...
[1699.34s -> 1720.12s]  Ow. Don't go in the
[1720.12s -> 1727.86s]  air. Dragon,
[1727.86s -> 1746.62s]  you're being quenched.
[1746.62s -> 1748.92s]  Try hitting it.
[1748.92s -> 1750.92s]  We're in a weird spot. I'm not
[1750.92s -> 1752.92s]  the type of character that can fight a dragon that well.
[1752.92s -> 1755.40s]  Okay? Hey.
[1755.40s -> 1758.79s]  You just... Hey, let him seethe.
[1758.79s -> 1761.80s]  Seethe.
[1761.80s -> 1765.26s]  I hit it.
[1765.26s -> 1775.37s]  Looks to me like the dragon's dead.
[1775.37s -> 1777.80s]  What are you doing? I think we're desynced.
[1777.80s -> 1779.80s]  Silly is secret.
[1779.80s -> 1784.98s]  This is actually a good idea.
[1784.98s -> 1789.26s]  Although I didn't really get
[1789.26s -> 1792.89s]  much. Did you get anything good?
[1792.89s -> 1794.89s]  No, I got like notes
[1794.89s -> 1797.90s]  and cookbooks like usual.
[1797.90s -> 1799.90s]  Notes, some cookbooks, some
[1799.90s -> 1801.90s]  runes. Okay, so that's
[1801.90s -> 1803.90s]  completed. Let's go ahead and mark that as
[1803.90s -> 1807.35s]  completed. I don't think that's normally
[1807.35s -> 1809.35s]  a boss. Do you
[1809.35s -> 1811.35s]  do you want to fight a boss?
[1811.35s -> 1813.66s]  Because I know where one is right now.
[1813.66s -> 1816.66s]  Yeah. This tower of return takes
[1816.66s -> 1820.44s]  you... I forget where this takes you.
[1820.44s -> 1822.44s]  Where did you even go?
[1822.44s -> 1826.47s]  We are really desynced.
[1826.47s -> 1830.50s]  Just kind of wandering. I'm in like
[1830.50s -> 1832.50s]  a constant state right now of thinking I know where
[1832.50s -> 1834.50s]  I am and then going somewhere and going, no, this isn't
[1834.50s -> 1836.50s]  it. Okay, so
[1836.50s -> 1838.50s]  you teleport to
[1838.50s -> 1840.74s]  the northern
[1840.74s -> 1842.74s]  lake, northern
[1842.74s -> 1844.74s]  lake shore, all the way up
[1844.74s -> 1846.74s]  where the runes are, the king's
[1846.74s -> 1848.74s]  realm runes. There is a boss
[1848.74s -> 1852.52s]  right there. Where?
[1852.52s -> 1854.52s]  We need to figure out, like people are saying
[1854.52s -> 1856.52s]  there's a hotkey to accept a vote.
[1856.52s -> 1859.59s]  No, do road to the manor first.
[1859.59s -> 1863.75s]  Let me upgrade this fucking sword, please.
[1863.75s -> 1865.75s]  Where the blacksmith is. And then right
[1865.75s -> 1868.50s]  below that is a boss we can fight. LB
[1868.50s -> 1870.50s]  in the map, apparently. You have to be
[1870.50s -> 1874.34s]  in the map. Oh, and
[1874.34s -> 1876.34s]  then, yeah, then it centers on
[1876.34s -> 1878.34s]  whatever you voted for. Really?
[1878.34s -> 1885.77s]  That's cool. I'm kind of the master of trying to
[1885.77s -> 1887.77s]  teleport somewhere and just placing markers
[1887.77s -> 1892.76s]  on it. The markers are so helpful.
[1892.76s -> 1897.93s]  We need to keep doing it.
[1897.93s -> 1899.93s]  Alright. Do you have any smithing stones?
[1899.93s -> 1901.93s]  Six?
[1901.93s -> 1903.93s]  I probably do, but I'm likely about
[1903.93s -> 1906.68s]  to use them. No, I don't.
[1906.68s -> 1908.68s]  So, this is the idea.
[1908.68s -> 1913.53s]  Here we go. The idea
[1913.53s -> 1916.73s]  is this. Why is he acting like I never talk to him?
[1916.73s -> 1920.18s]  Okay, see this banished knight's
[1920.18s -> 1922.68s]  greatsword? I'm thinking
[1922.68s -> 1924.68s]  of just
[1924.68s -> 1926.98s]  upgrading the hell out of this right now.
[1926.98s -> 1930.50s]  Just upgrading this. And infusing it.
[1930.50s -> 1933.06s]  Right? Either this or the battleaxe.
[1933.06s -> 1935.06s]  And I don't know which one
[1935.06s -> 1937.06s]  is better, because I don't know
[1937.06s -> 1939.24s]  min-max bullshit. Battleaxe
[1939.24s -> 1941.24s]  or banished knight greatsword?
[1941.24s -> 1943.24s]  Which one of these is, like, better
[1943.24s -> 1947.77s]  to use? I think the greatsword
[1947.77s -> 1956.28s]  probably better. Sword, big sword,
[1956.28s -> 1958.28s]  sword, sword, sword, sword. Axe is cooler.
[1958.28s -> 1960.28s]  Sword, sword, sword, sword. Axe is cooler.
[1960.28s -> 1962.28s]  Axe, trust me.
[1962.28s -> 1968.94s]  Sword, sword, sword, sword.
[1968.94s -> 1970.94s]  I need more smithing. I can't believe
[1970.94s -> 1972.94s]  not every person in your chat didn't say the same
[1972.94s -> 1975.82s]  thing. I need how many more
[1975.82s -> 1980.55s]  smithing stone ones do I need? You need three
[1980.55s -> 1983.18s]  smithing stone ones to get out of,
[1983.18s -> 1986.18s]  I think. I think three. Yeah.
[1986.18s -> 1988.18s]  I need two more smithing
[1988.18s -> 1990.18s]  stone ones. You can buy them at the shop
[1990.18s -> 1995.61s]  at the place.
[1995.61s -> 1997.98s]  Okay. Can I
[1997.98s -> 1999.98s]  just go there? Can I just get this out of the way?
[1999.98s -> 2001.98s]  I promise I won't be doing this again.
[2001.98s -> 2009.40s]  He grinded off stream.
[2009.40s -> 2014.26s]  I didn't grind off stream.
[2014.26s -> 2018.94s]  I just prepared off stream.
[2018.94s -> 2020.94s]  I didn't get exposed. I literally killed the same
[2020.94s -> 2022.94s]  enemy ten times and then bought like a dozen
[2022.94s -> 2026.71s]  stones at the vendor. Did you accept
[2026.71s -> 2036.36s]  it? I thought I did.
[2036.36s -> 2038.36s]  Here. I was just gonna fucking banish
[2038.36s -> 2041.43s]  you. I have the cheap
[2041.43s -> 2043.43s]  upgrade thing and I think you don't was part of
[2043.43s -> 2047.08s]  the situation as well. What do you mean?
[2047.08s -> 2049.08s]  You have to actually spend like
[2049.08s -> 2051.08s]  three, six smithing stones.
[2051.08s -> 2053.82s]  Yes, I do. I don't. So that
[2053.82s -> 2055.82s]  was the whole problem yesterday. The whole problem was
[2055.82s -> 2057.82s]  you have the cheat code and I don't.
[2057.82s -> 2061.90s]  Who's this?
[2061.90s -> 2064.52s]  Oh, it's okay. This is
[2064.52s -> 2070.86s]  very, very odd. I thought it
[2070.86s -> 2076.17s]  was a chicken. Okay, how many
[2076.17s -> 2088.46s]  of these things do I need?
[2088.46s -> 2091.59s]  Oh, I'm back already. Lay out your arms then.
[2091.59s -> 2097.90s]  Tarnished. Where are you going?
[2097.90s -> 2099.90s]  You've played this game fucking thousands of times.
[2099.90s -> 2102.20s]  How have you not figured out where the blacksmith
[2102.20s -> 2105.34s]  is permanently in your brain? You fucking
[2105.34s -> 2109.74s]  idiot. I just don't know how it's possible.
[2109.74s -> 2111.74s]  It's by the fire. To the left of the fire. Don't
[2111.74s -> 2121.21s]  forget that ever again. Okay, we're good.
[2121.21s -> 2123.69s]  Boom, boom, go.
[2123.69s -> 2126.92s]  Go, go. All right.
[2126.92s -> 2129.29s]  I got a plus eight.
[2129.29s -> 2131.29s]  I got a plus eight greatsword.
[2131.29s -> 2133.53s]  I need one more smithing
[2133.53s -> 2135.53s]  stone three. Do you have one of those?
[2135.53s -> 2141.06s]  Smithing stone three. And just a regular smithing stone three?
[2141.06s -> 2143.74s]  I do. Excellent.
[2143.74s -> 2145.74s]  If I please have it I will trade you for something that I have.
[2145.74s -> 2150.99s]  What do you need? I needed like a spell.
[2150.99s -> 2154.69s]  You want me to list out the spells I have?
[2154.69s -> 2156.69s]  Do you actually have spells? Do you have any
[2156.69s -> 2158.69s]  like...crystal greatswords
[2158.69s -> 2160.69s]  or anything? I have...
[2160.69s -> 2166.24s]  This one's really important. You need this one there. There's your and I also have
[2166.76s -> 2173.57s]  Gelmer's fury you need style. That's not I want arcane pick that up off the ground
[2173.57s -> 2180.03s]  It does not belong on the ground. I mean you picked it up starlight. Did you pick this one up?
[2180.03s -> 2183.42s]  No that I dropped the stone for you. Oh
[2186.23s -> 2196.41s]  Tonish what the fuck is wrong with you Mike? Here we go
[2196.41s -> 2204.50s]  I have a plus ten great sword now and it's good and it's it's just a regular sword and I can infuse it
[2207.44s -> 2210.06s]  What stone do you need after that?
[2210.58s -> 2219.39s]  Hold on. Let me do this first. This is probably this one right heavy will six one sixty seven that okay
[2219.39s -> 2224.41s]  I I have smithing stone fours you can use to get to 12. Where is this better?
[2227.05s -> 2230.49s]  No, no, I am I'm I put fire on it
[2230.49s -> 2240.18s]  I need you shouldn't put fire on it because then I think it's faith scaling. Okay
[2241.50s -> 2247.70s]  What do I need fours are there any smithing stone fours flame of red main is insane
[2247.86s -> 2259.86s]  I need do I I need one smithing stone four and then I will just have to go
[2259.86s -> 2269.46s]  Do you have any smithing stone fours? Yeah, I have two also one down take this as well because I have a
[2269.78s -> 2279.22s]  Couple of scrolls like spell scrolls that you should probably be using royal house scroll. I can't leave it. Nevermind
[2279.22s -> 2294.11s]  I put it down in the main room. Thank you so much. Okay now
[2294.65s -> 2298.32s]  Everything is gonna be good to go. I have a plus 11
[2298.32s -> 2303.26s]  This thing's doing like this thing's doing like three four hundred damage. This thing's good to go
[2303.26s -> 2312.92s]  All right, the crack blade is shit on bosses. I'm just I just wanted to scaling use fire use fire. Everyone's
[2313.72s -> 2316.45s]  Telling you you're wrong. Yeah, I am right
[2316.45s -> 2323.58s]  There is one fire that I believe is faith and there's one that's actually strength. I am wrong and I apologize
[2324.14s -> 2340.90s]  That's like less damage though. That's all right. Wait, what wait what just happened? This better? It's oh, it's split damage
[2341.38s -> 2348.39s]  Craig please
[2348.39s -> 2359.85s]  Okay, here's what's gonna happen. Why am I so confused by this? This is 232
[2360.37s -> 2365.63s]  232 14 135 versus
[2367.12s -> 2371.39s]  214 no, it's whatever. It's the fucking same. It's OP fire. I'm just gonna keep this
[2371.39s -> 2382.32s]  This is what I'm using for now. We'll figure it out later fire infusion, please great sword swings. You're picking the same infusion
[2382.32s -> 2386.84s]  What? All right. I gotta stop looking at chat cuz like I look over here and I go wait
[2386.84s -> 2394.66s]  Why don't I look over here? No, all right. Here's what I'm doing. I'm almost my brain is split between two spots
[2394.90s -> 2406.41s]  Here's what I'm doing. That's what I'm doing. That's what I'm doing. I
[2409.55s -> 2420.64s]  Can't just like flip-flop for like the next hour. Okay, I'm ready from here
[2420.64s -> 2426.83s]  Where do you want to go flame of red me and got nerfed so hard. It's shit now chat
[2426.83s -> 2433.06s]  I don't know. I I'm just gonna go with the crack do something that you like. That's what I'm gonna do
[2433.06s -> 2436.83s]  So let's now you run it when I go fight the boss to go back to the Smith
[2436.83s -> 2449.39s]  I'm gonna go down that actually lightens up the load a little bit. I could put on some better armor. All right, we're good
[2449.51s -> 2458.20s]  Just a short 45 minute stalls not a big deal. I thought stall its progression. That's true
[2458.24s -> 2469.88s]  We're not gonna do a raid as a guild until your gear score goes up. Tell chat stop being backseat Andes
[2469.98s -> 2472.46s]  No, I mean, here's the problem
[2472.46s -> 2478.86s]  I keep asking different questions and reading so I ask five questions and then I get an answer to the second question
[2478.86s -> 2484.14s]  And I think it's an answer to the first question while people are spamming an answer for the fourth question
[2484.14s -> 2486.44s]  So I'm like so confused
[2487.44s -> 2490.60s]  It's my own answers to questions that are
[2490.96s -> 2496.18s]  That like also played the game a while ago and they've actually patched and balanced a lot of stuff and like I don't even know
[2496.18s -> 2501.59s]  What is real anymore? It's my it's my it's my fault though. It's not their fault. All right
[2503.48s -> 2511.27s]  So you're ready ready to fight the boss? There is a catacombs like right here. Yeah, it's a it's literally I haven't marked
[2511.27s -> 2515.11s]  I did have it marked and it's marked
[2515.43s -> 2517.06s]  Um
[2517.06s -> 2531.95s]  Where is it writer? It's right here somewhere. Where is it? This place is a bit of a mess. I haven't marked like right here
[2532.31s -> 2538.02s]  I'm doing so much more damage. I'm doing like 300 damage a swing now. It's so worth it
[2538.62s -> 2546.00s]  This crab coming over here. I got
[2546.58s -> 2550.59s]  Wrecked are you alive?
[2550.71s -> 2554.86s]  Yeah, uh
[2554.86s -> 2558.70s]  It's over. It's not over there. It's over here. It's near my marker
[2559.30s -> 2565.68s]  The hell is my mother I
[2566.20s -> 2571.64s]  Remember every playthrough I've ever done. I've wandered around this place forgetting where this hole is. It's right here
[2571.64s -> 2573.64s]  I it's my markers right here
[2574.04s -> 2576.28s]  It's right here somewhere
[2579.27s -> 2586.52s]  Goddamnit. What where where is it? Oh shit. Hey, you want to go back to round it?
[2587.04s -> 2593.44s]  It's the floor. Oh, it's a little it's an illusion floor. It's illusion floor. I was saying like what the hell
[2594.24s -> 2596.24s]  Like some trick to this one. Oh
[2597.86s -> 2598.94s]  shit
[2598.94s -> 2615.56s]  What the hell is this is an interesting swing? This is kind of a bunny. This is like a goofy swing
[2616.34s -> 2625.60s]  What?
[2625.60s -> 2630.87s]  Where are you? I make a giant rock candy stick. I'm not getting rid of this
[2630.87s -> 2640.19s]  Why did you guys want me to do anything else down here? This thing does 400 damage now. You gotta be shitting me
[2640.19s -> 2642.19s]  I can't believe people were telling me to do the fire
[2644.56s -> 2651.03s]  When you say down here, okay, so let me come find you. I think guys there there we are
[2651.87s -> 2657.40s]  Okay, and for reference I have a plus 20 long sword now and then when you ask me in two hours and you're like
[2657.40s -> 2663.00s]  Surprised that I have it. I just want you to know now you have a plus 20. Did you grind off stream? No
[2664.12s -> 2674.18s]  Did you see my like super cool rock candy sword? I did not this is so cool. Wow. I actually love this
[2674.18s -> 2680.92s]  I didn't even know this is in the game. Huh? Yeah, that's so cool. It looks like a
[2681.72s -> 2683.72s]  Like a kebab gone wrong
[2683.88s -> 2689.72s]  Yeah, it looks like it looks like a like a kebab you left on the grill for like six hours. All right, let's do it
[2690.24s -> 2696.58s]  Okay. Well, this is a problem
[2696.66s -> 2713.80s]  Wait, don't maybe don't aggro that don't aggro the the crystal night. I think he's gonna get spawned in. Yep
[2713.80s -> 2715.92s]  He is that's when he gets activated
[2716.60s -> 2723.55s]  All right. It is imperative that we thought this room is so small
[2723.55s -> 2726.31s]  We have to just like co-op the fuck out of one of them early. I
[2727.03s -> 2730.86s]  Thought the one with less health
[2730.86s -> 2734.66s]  Well, I mean like when we first get in here like we just nice holy shit. Oh
[2741.81s -> 2745.65s]  Come on. There's no way. There's no way. There's no way. I
[2747.02s -> 2753.06s]  Can't believe that why did it not hit him? How did that not hit him?
[2753.50s -> 2760.65s]  It's all right. Now you have a you have a 1v1 now with your plus 20 sword. You can do it
[2760.65s -> 2763.81s]  It's just it's a regular crystal night. The worst part about this is doing them both the same time
[2763.81s -> 2767.05s]  I'm used to doing it with a shield that can parry this one can't
[2767.97s -> 2783.98s]  My damage is too low against him. I like need to parry him. Remember the timings
[2785.61s -> 2789.09s]  This shield cannot parry. Oh, you actually can't parry
[2794.26s -> 2796.14s]  I'm out of healing
[2796.14s -> 2807.13s]  Well, it looks like you're just gonna have to do it. Sorry. I don't know I the hitbox he apparently I don't know
[2807.13s -> 2810.15s]  I swung the sword at him and it just didn't I just didn't hurt him
[2810.89s -> 2824.11s]  America. Yeah, we can do it. Don't switch my shield. We just need to
[2824.67s -> 2827.23s]  Go absolutely hard on the first boss
[2827.71s -> 2832.50s]  Missed be gone. I love that word
[2833.02s -> 2846.13s]  Missed be gone. I love how you read dead just left your horse like well the horses keep desyncing
[2846.13s -> 2870.70s]  So I just got off of it. I don't know. I'm down here. Hold on. Don't go in. All right, let's go
[2872.46s -> 2879.90s]  That's rolled right into that
[2879.90s -> 2897.02s]  I'm gonna distract this one over here. I still don't know the timings on these guys at all
[2897.02s -> 2899.02s]  It's been so long since I've seen them
[2899.18s -> 2902.25s]  I'd rather fight the crystal night
[2902.49s -> 2916.35s]  The crystal night has so much health. He's distracted. I died. He distracted him right into me
[2916.79s -> 2919.31s]  He's just not he kind of just decided he was gonna go after you
[2956.05s -> 2966.11s]  Crucible night is being I know he really is he's letting us duel. Oh, this is over now. No, no, no
[2969.21s -> 2971.01s]  Jesus that's fucking fast
[2971.01s -> 2978.21s]  The misbegotten warrior is so annoying because he does that jump in the air where he he has to jump in the air swing
[2978.77s -> 2986.38s]  One of them is insanely fast and one is incredibly slow. Let me uh, I will try and take aggro from the crucible night
[2986.38s -> 2992.38s]  Once he spawns that's one of the bosses like the early one that you fight in the the jail
[2992.58s -> 2998.12s]  That might be one of the longest times I spent fighting a boss in dark and Elden Ring to be fair
[2998.12s -> 3002.36s]  That's like I'm used to shit. I consider this fight to be one of the worst fights in the whole game
[3002.36s -> 3015.62s]  What do you mean this this randomized fight? What do you mean this fight this boss fight? Did you not do this either that it's randomized
[3015.62s -> 3020.02s]  What do you mean? Did he not do this in the main game? Oh my god, dude
[3020.30s -> 3028.35s]  Hold on. Did you have you never seen these two in the same room together? No, dude. You got to play Elden Ring
[3030.63s -> 3033.11s]  You got a play that you got to play Elden Ring man
[3033.71s -> 3041.74s]  You've never seen these two people in the same boss fight. I don't think so
[3042.34s -> 3044.37s]  Okay, so
[3044.37s -> 3050.06s]  In radan's area when you go to fight radan, uh-huh. You did not
[3050.46s -> 3055.14s]  Fight these two you did you know, did you ever go back to radan's castle?
[3055.56s -> 3064.33s]  Yeah, you know, this is a boss fight in the game is the crucible night and misbegotten warrior. Okay, I guess I missed it
[3064.33s -> 3073.42s]  Holy shit. Sorry. Oh my god. I'm like jealous of you. I'm actually like incredibly jealous of you
[3073.94s -> 3084.29s]  You've got like a lot of game. Well, I've got like full aggro. Let's start hitting them. This fight sucks
[3093.01s -> 3108.66s]  Unbelievable unbelievable start unbelievable start he's almost dead
[3108.90s -> 3122.71s]  Careful. He's coming this way. I'm fucking this up so bad
[3123.31s -> 3127.25s]  If I could just land one fucking hit on this guy
[3128.13s -> 3143.29s]  Okay, he's dead. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. He does have a shitload of health
[3143.29s -> 3168.99s]  Oh my god, it's the armor. We need like a blunt weapon. I think this is technically blunt. There he goes with this bullshit
[3169.55s -> 3197.36s]  Good good. Good. Good. Good. Uh-oh. Oh
[3198.78s -> 3200.22s]  Oh
[3200.22s -> 3204.17s]  It's okay, but I got I got it. I got it. I got it. Yeah, you got it
[3204.69s -> 3207.78s]  it's
[3208.54s -> 3210.54s]  You can't win the first part of the day
[3210.94s -> 3220.01s]  We're good. We're good. I I thought I was going crazy because
[3220.57s -> 3226.89s]  When we were talking about how this was not in the real dance castle, we're Dan. You got me saying it. I'm sorry
[3227.17s -> 3232.96s]  Yeah, so the when you first said that you were like, what are you talking about? This is randomized
[3232.96s -> 3235.93s]  I thought you were fucking with me. No, I
[3237.81s -> 3244.47s]  Don't castle had like all the chimeras and stuff the Kimmer Kimmer is so I was like nah
[3244.75s -> 3251.62s]  I didn't explore it too much. Actually, I don't blame you cuz that area is is probably one of the shittiest areas in the whole game
[3251.62s -> 3254.02s]  I didn't even know there was a catacomb in there
[3254.02s -> 3260.57s]  I I do not blame you for skipping that part of the like of the optional kind of stuff
[3260.57s -> 3262.73s]  Well, I'm dead and I got to get my souls on that item
[3263.05s -> 3273.45s]  But I do you want me to fire me you have a bonfire go to the castle before the festival
[3273.45s -> 3279.80s]  I thought once you get to the castle the festival has already started. I think if you it I think if you beat
[3280.48s -> 3285.19s]  Dan if you kill for Dan and then you go, maybe you skip it, right?
[3286.72s -> 3303.18s]  Where's the bonfire from here? No, I think a lot of people don't bother going back after the tourney
[3303.18s -> 3309.98s]  It's possible this fight only happens if you go to red main early. It doesn't happen after the tourney even afterwards
[3312.10s -> 3317.42s]  There's one of the teleporters that just takes you straight to the festival and then it was like, okay festival
[3317.62s -> 3322.14s]  Then I did for dawn and then look the whole castle looked like shit. Oh, yes
[3322.18s -> 3329.22s]  I already I already did the boss. So like why would I go back to the castle? It can happen after I guess it does happen after
[3336.57s -> 3344.12s]  The hardest to find I lost again. I hope you don't I think I know leave me alone. Leave me alone
[3344.44s -> 3352.37s]  Sorry, I got so upset with you. We're not knowing where the secret boss was
[3352.37s -> 3355.13s]  That's impossible to find something that I did that you didn't do
[3355.13s -> 3362.08s]  I'm going to and say probably not and I'm the only I'm gonna give you one reason why that is it's not because of
[3362.16s -> 3365.88s]  Playing it but it's because of watching every single fatty video on this game
[3365.92s -> 3383.27s]  So I I don't think there's anything that I haven't seen not for my own doing I got what did you get in there?
[3383.43s -> 3387.56s]  Like a spear. Oh cool. I got a glass shard
[3388.08s -> 3390.80s]  I'm taking up a lot of glass my hand is raw
[3391.40s -> 3398.83s]  See, I just thought I thought you were messing with me. I was trying to mess with you back, but then no I was the wrong one
[3398.83s -> 3404.39s]  I remember we were talking before the stream started about how I'm actually a from soft from soft fraud. I
[3404.91s -> 3411.05s]  Don't think that's true
[3411.05s -> 3419.32s]  In Sekiro, you know the big giant fire beast. Yeah. Did you do that? Yeah, I did. I did not do that
[3423.06s -> 3430.57s]  There's a lot of things that I've noped out of but you know, I'm a bit of a fraud isn't that smart though
[3430.77s -> 3437.80s]  You're just kind of smart because if you go to like an optional area and you just like this is dumb
[3437.80s -> 3443.76s]  I'm not fucking doing this. You're kind of like like really shitty from sauce bosses
[3443.80s -> 3448.31s]  I actually that that fire boss and secures is way up there for me
[3448.43s -> 3451.87s]  Yeah doing the the hate with the hatred at hatred boss, right?
[3452.11s -> 3458.16s]  Doing that boss and after like the 20th attempt just going like, you know what I could like go mow the lawn right now
[3458.16s -> 3460.16s]  I don't need to do this
[3460.72s -> 3462.72s]  I don't think that's a bad thing
[3468.96s -> 3479.15s]  So let me clear that okay
[3479.15s -> 3484.55s]  I think we have an opportunity to attempt the boss again last to do 66
[3484.67s -> 3490.03s]  But I feel like if we do that this early we might get trapped there and it might be like a disaster
[3490.03s -> 3495.84s]  So let's um, you know how you you can go up the whole right side or left side of the lake. Mm-hmm
[3495.96s -> 3498.12s]  Like let's just go like we haven't done any of that
[3498.12s -> 3501.64s]  There's like a whole urn tree and there's catacombs and there's a whole bunch of stuff on both sides
[3501.68s -> 3512.86s]  Yeah, let's let's take it slow. Well, you want to you left or right side? Um, let's go on the left side
[3512.86s -> 3518.51s]  I feel like there's more things over there. I remember let's start at the
[3519.07s -> 3525.61s]  The ruins way at the bottom and just like hugged the left and then you go up into like the albaneric village and all that
[3525.61s -> 3533.87s]  Oh, you want to go you want to go all the way down down? Okay. Yeah and on the map remember press left bumper
[3533.87s -> 3551.01s]  It'll take you straight to it. Yeah that we hold that left side is um, you're saying I think no map
[3551.01s -> 3560.98s]  We have to get a map. What is this title randomizer with stir emotional Halloween special?
[3562.62s -> 3569.86s]  That's actually pretty good. That's that's good. It's way better than I did. I am getting a bit emotional
[3571.39s -> 3574.14s]  full emotional playthrough
[3574.42s -> 3589.50s]  Emotional Halloween special I should be in like an orange shirt to be really fair though that whole Ronnie quest line
[3589.50s -> 3593.48s]  I don't think is I at least in my opinion
[3593.48s -> 3598.33s]  I don't know how you would do any of that like there's so much of that that's kind of I was like
[3598.33s -> 3604.25s]  Why would I do this? I actually did do it you did. I mean I got a lot of hell cave right here
[3604.25s -> 3608.98s]  I I mean I had to read like, you know, there's no way you do it like intuitively
[3609.58s -> 3610.86s]  It's a total mess
[3610.86s -> 3615.70s]  That's what I mean like doing that without any guidance is like I don't even know why you would even do some of that stuff
[3615.70s -> 3616.42s]  Why are you even attack?
[3616.42s -> 3622.14s]  How do people even how do you I feel like a lot of people kind of stumble upon it like the first people that do
[3622.14s -> 3624.26s]  That mission they stumble upon it and they go
[3625.45s -> 3629.95s]  What the fuck just happened and then they go oh my god and they and they write it down because obviously the first person
[3630.05s -> 3631.45s]  It took me to a whole bunch of places
[3631.45s -> 3638.37s]  I didn't even know existed like the whole ant like ants as an enemy type was like one of the last things I found in
[3638.37s -> 3641.45s]  The whole game was like, I don't know how I missed like an entire like ant cave
[3641.45s -> 3647.37s]  I think that's part of the reason why people like these games so much though is because
[3647.67s -> 3654.16s]  It's just stuff that you're never going to do and that's cool. Yeah
[3656.13s -> 3663.11s]  Thank God we bought let me cast my magics wrong one. Wait, don't do it yet. I know what you're about to do
[3663.11s -> 3667.74s]  Don't do it yet. Where are you? I cast starlight. No
[3668.66s -> 3682.12s]  Okay, you got a little bit of a lightning situation up there we do
[3682.76s -> 3685.44s]  Let's keep we don't gotta go up there screw them
[3686.28s -> 3702.93s]  Thank God you have that spell are we both long sword Andy's we are are we?
[3704.50s -> 3712.14s]  Copies me you copies me. I did cuz I I took what you said to heart
[3712.82s -> 3719.48s]  What did I say? I'm just like it's just works and it's good and it's not like oh I have to do this
[3719.48s -> 3737.32s]  I have to do this just pick the thing that works and it's good. I thought there was a turn in here
[3737.32s -> 3740.84s]  I did too. Oh, you gotta go into the waterfall. Oh
[3747.52s -> 3749.76s]  Who what am I talking about here?
[3752.74s -> 3758.31s]  What the hell are you doing? I mean I gotta get something from the nominees here. We haven't done it once
[3760.39s -> 3766.23s]  I'm just gonna do this now so that in a year from now people can tell me this was the worst sound
[3767.95s -> 3778.65s]  I'm gonna make sure that category to get filled out at the end of the year. Um, I think we go down
[3779.23s -> 3784.05s]  Down. Oh, yeah, I got it. I got a epic. I got an epic loot up here
[3784.57s -> 3805.82s]  What? Oh, yeah, you do go down of rune arc nice
[3806.26s -> 3817.80s]  There's usually something scary down here. Isn't there at the end of this cave?
[3817.80s -> 3821.40s]  I believe it would normally be one of the berserker guys. I
[3822.08s -> 3826.68s]  It sounds like a dragon. It's something very loud something big
[3827.20s -> 3839.18s]  Has very heavy footsteps. Yo, watch my back
[3839.82s -> 3847.93s]  These guys don't get wash my back bro. I can't do that when the thing explodes
[3848.69s -> 3862.06s]  Secrets over here. Oh, hey. Hey, I gotta cast my spell wait. Okay. It's getting a little it's a little dark in here
[3862.06s -> 3864.30s]  I mean, thank you. Maybe it's like a starlight kid
[3865.02s -> 3871.06s]  There it is. Thank you. I'm only gonna do that once. I don't I don't even know what that was. They're all staff
[3871.06s -> 3878.72s]  I'm only gonna do that once every ten minutes. Okay, I've gotten like four stabs at this point and one spell
[3881.24s -> 3889.68s]  I even upgraded the ones. Oh god. That's a lot of guys. Why why they don't why they don't they don't care
[3890.32s -> 3894.65s]  Over here. I'm gonna take their item. No, you angered them. Oh
[3898.13s -> 3903.22s]  No, you have angered them. All right. Well fuck him up
[3907.12s -> 3912.48s]  Why is this one's huge? Oh, you've never seen the huge albinoeric
[3912.96s -> 3914.64s]  Yeah
[3914.64s -> 3920.67s]  Have you seen the huge albinoeric? Yeah, nice
[3921.23s -> 3925.06s]  See, I got something good here
[3926.88s -> 3931.12s]  Oh man, I think that's actually fucking a thousand times better than what I have
[3932.13s -> 3934.93s]  God every item you pick up is a thousand times better than what you have
[3934.93s -> 3935.73s]  Let's go upgrade it
[3935.73s -> 3941.33s]  But I really I really mean it this time like I think this actually is the like unbelievable
[3943.28s -> 3947.12s]  It's faith weapon. Whatever. I'm sticking with what I have. What is it?
[3947.92s -> 3949.92s]  God slayer great sword
[3951.66s -> 3952.62s]  Oh
[3952.62s -> 3954.16s]  Oh god
[3954.16s -> 3956.16s]  God's flame. Oh flame
[3962.35s -> 3974.61s]  Another staff, I'll be careful when we go through the darkness if something's gonna appear
[3976.42s -> 3977.22s]  Ooh
[3977.22s -> 3982.66s]  Oh a jar
[3982.66s -> 3989.17s]  Oh, that's another good one. I can't believe elden beast was down here
[3989.97s -> 3997.38s]  Don't say that
[3997.38s -> 3999.38s]  Uh, is it time to put pants on?
[4001.63s -> 4006.94s]  Yes, it is
[4006.94s -> 4009.50s]  Uh-oh look out. It's a snail
[4010.22s -> 4016.16s]  This is the gimmick fight. It is the gimmick fight
[4018.77s -> 4020.77s]  Just to go where it's kind of lit up
[4022.21s -> 4025.97s]  This is like at all like a glow i'm just distracting the guy
[4027.01s -> 4031.57s]  You you handle the snail and he's just staying in the same spot. He's kind of dumb
[4038.00s -> 4040.06s]  elden beast
[4040.06s -> 4045.14s]  Cookbook
[4045.14s -> 4047.14s]  Got a flower. This is a question for chat
[4048.61s -> 4052.69s]  These two weapons are effectively the exact same weapon, but there's weird
[4053.41s -> 4056.85s]  This one scales differently. Do I have the right call?
[4058.24s -> 4060.24s]  Is the bandage still better than this?
[4064.40s -> 4066.64s]  You could do fire on the other one and do weld them
[4067.12s -> 4074.75s]  I'm gonna get this to plus 20 at least right we have to
[4075.63s -> 4077.63s]  At least I got ice frying hatchet
[4078.70s -> 4081.66s]  I think that is one of the things that actually did get nerfed a lot
[4082.30s -> 4084.62s]  That's the speedrun kind of broken speedrun item, right?
[4085.66s -> 4088.54s]  The earliest I think that was one of like the first nerfs
[4109.44s -> 4115.14s]  That was an epic dungeon there my friend
[4115.54s -> 4117.54s]  No, that was good. We got some good stuff
[4122.26s -> 4125.22s]  The medallion that's a good question. The medallions might be a problem
[4126.10s -> 4131.62s]  We can get there one of them. Oh, you do already have one of them. I have the like left halig tree medallion. Okay
[4133.97s -> 4136.37s]  Uh, I think I think you just have to teleport out of this one
[4136.53s -> 4144.38s]  Yeah, I think we we need to go get the map. Can we go to like the south ray lucaria gate and just go just get the map
[4145.98s -> 4148.48s]  uh, okay, because
[4149.12s -> 4151.47s]  Yeah, this is
[4151.47s -> 4163.04s]  Irritating me
[4163.04s -> 4165.04s]  Did you vote?
[4165.12s -> 4166.16s]  Wait
[4166.16s -> 4167.38s]  um
[4167.38s -> 4170.50s]  Change that go to the the laski arm ruins
[4180.14s -> 4182.99s]  You hate my teeth
[4182.99s -> 4186.19s]  They're mine. You don't have to worry about it
[4201.54s -> 4206.18s]  In the middle of that somebody goes hey dude, thanks for clearing up my mucus. I like appreciate it
[4209.58s -> 4214.70s]  Did you no, it's just I just look I look over here sometimes and somebody just writes a random sentence
[4217.06s -> 4226.82s]  Like I feel like that person was actually talking to a doctor and they like talked in the wrong channel. He's a bot
[4228.30s -> 4233.82s]  Although why would you text that to your doctor? Oh, hey, dude. Hey, thanks for clearing up my mucus really appreciate it
[4234.06s -> 4239.44s]  it's like why I
[4239.44s -> 4243.92s]  I mean if your doctor helped you with your mucus, I'm sure he'd like to hear that he helped
[4246.02s -> 4248.82s]  But if I went, I don't know if I every time i've gone to the doctor
[4249.98s -> 4255.34s]  It's not like oh, hey, yeah, i'm gonna text you and let you know like when I wouldn't like my uh throat throat gets better
[4256.06s -> 4258.27s]  I don't know where you're going. I got the map
[4259.23s -> 4260.11s]  Oh
[4260.11s -> 4262.67s]  I'm just trying to get all you want it. I'm just trying to get away from all the
[4263.39s -> 4265.39s]  You made me turn around and now i'm getting attacked
[4274.51s -> 4275.55s]  Uh
[4275.55s -> 4277.55s]  Now we can go wherever you want
[4281.07s -> 4283.55s]  Uh come mortar. Can you see where I am? Yes, I can
[4284.11s -> 4286.11s]  Yeah, there's like a jumpy over here
[4287.26s -> 4289.26s]  And there should be a jail up here
[4289.76s -> 4293.73s]  Ooh, let's do it
[4296.11s -> 4305.25s]  I think is how it's pronounced. I got 10k souls on me. I should probably like
[4306.45s -> 4308.45s]  Use that at some point. I do too
[4311.04s -> 4313.12s]  But let's just hope there's not something horrible in here
[4318.74s -> 4320.74s]  I don't think this is that bad
[4336.50s -> 4344.32s]  oh my god
[4344.32s -> 4346.32s]  I thought you were gonna swing again, but
[4361.58s -> 4364.21s]  Well, I don't know what this is
[4364.29s -> 4367.41s]  Uh, I think it just means I go a little bit faster and i'm a little bit stronger
[4367.57s -> 4369.57s]  No, I mean the boss what the boss is doing
[4373.66s -> 4376.86s]  No, I think that's what it was like my weapon has a coating on it now
[4384.77s -> 4388.53s]  Ooh, do you get anything good?
[4388.53s -> 4390.53s]  Not really. I already had that smithing stone sevens
[4392.62s -> 4413.31s]  Our somber seven
[4413.31s -> 4417.15s]  It was better than what I had on
[4417.15s -> 4435.98s]  Kind of they're watching us. They are okay
[4436.91s -> 4437.95s]  uh
[4437.95s -> 4445.78s]  Very very nice. I don't know. Why is this marked this lake shore chat? Why did I mark this?
[4447.58s -> 4450.30s]  You've been marking things whenever they're complete. I felt like
[4451.10s -> 4456.62s]  I've been doing complete as a sword. This is means like is it a merchant? Oh the crab merchant is here. Okay
[4457.26s -> 4459.26s]  But I I don't I can take this off because I took the um
[4463.63s -> 4465.63s]  uh the ball bearing
[4466.93s -> 4471.78s]  All right, let's go up that let's just hug this left side like you want to do
[4472.74s -> 4477.26s]  Yeah
[4477.26s -> 4480.22s]  No, you're gonna have to get over it. I'm not i'm not saying it chat wants me to do something
[4480.22s -> 4482.62s]  And i'm just gonna have to you're just gonna have to get over it. This is not happening
[4484.67s -> 4492.74s]  You're just gonna have to get over it. Oh god, you got lobstered
[4498.50s -> 4504.50s]  Oh god
[4504.50s -> 4507.38s]  You're going like a really strange way through this forest
[4508.90s -> 4515.14s]  I saw like a a lot of enemies. I didn't want to do anything to is that another? Okay. What's with the dragons?
[4516.56s -> 4519.52s]  What's with all these dragons? They keep the same thing
[4520.16s -> 4522.40s]  When I was watching a fucking game of thrones
[4525.60s -> 4528.48s]  That sounds like somebody that's never heard of the series before
[4529.28s -> 4531.28s]  I sat down in the middle
[4531.76s -> 4537.58s]  the middle of an episode
[4537.58s -> 4539.76s]  Uh, oh
[4539.76s -> 4544.46s]  Let's just hold left
[4544.46s -> 4547.06s]  believe there's
[4547.06s -> 4555.54s]  Cave or something here
[4555.54s -> 4558.90s]  No, i'm wrong
[4558.90s -> 4563.14s]  Oh, I feel like there might be something. I think we go down
[4563.54s -> 4567.30s]  I want to you know that place where you fight like the giant and like the whole horde of people
[4568.69s -> 4570.69s]  I like that spot. Hmm
[4571.42s -> 4575.58s]  That was always my like weapon test zone because you respawn right next to like the battle
[4577.30s -> 4581.70s]  Armazula is gonna be really easy. It actually really might be we might be able to walk through it
[4582.42s -> 4585.55s]  It's all the random enemies
[4585.55s -> 4595.04s]  It's not gonna be as horrible
[4595.04s -> 4596.96s]  Okay, so we need to go
[4596.96s -> 4599.20s]  You want to go like up?
[4600.24s -> 4602.24s]  I could use that rotten crystal sword
[4606.83s -> 4609.47s]  The mob that you were talking about is on the east side of lyrania
[4619.90s -> 4622.22s]  Wait, wait, i'm in obany rock
[4623.10s -> 4625.10s]  Please take this medallion
[4625.42s -> 4628.08s]  You must use it. I love that's my favorite character
[4628.80s -> 4637.71s]  Wait, wait, please
[4637.71s -> 4640.43s]  What the hell is happening? I gotta get off the horse
[4641.15s -> 4644.42s]  It's a fucking bra dude. I mean it
[4647.90s -> 4651.74s]  There's so many people up here. We gotta kill that caster, man
[4653.10s -> 4654.22s]  i'm getting
[4654.22s -> 4655.66s]  Help it
[4655.66s -> 4657.66s]  I my game doesn't know what's the target
[4659.34s -> 4661.34s]  Oh my god, i'm so overwhelmed
[4661.74s -> 4664.03s]  just swing
[4664.03s -> 4666.72s]  Okay caster is
[4666.72s -> 4674.51s]  cast
[4674.51s -> 4677.55s]  get
[4677.55s -> 4678.51s]  this
[4678.51s -> 4680.75s]  Bat motherfucker get away from me
[4681.92s -> 4699.46s]  Okay, it's clapper. It's clapper clapper. I'm gonna spend my souls
[4700.50s -> 4702.90s]  My runes that's probably a good idea
[4703.46s -> 4709.47s]  Where's the boss fight? It's up a little more right?
[4709.97s -> 4721.87s]  Across the bridge and down
[4721.87s -> 4723.87s]  Uh, you talk to you get the guy up here
[4724.67s -> 4727.63s]  I can't remember why you need them. Yeah, i'm just trying to I just want to level up
[4728.35s -> 4741.34s]  I need way more endurance than this
[4741.34s -> 4763.07s]  he's in the
[4763.07s -> 4765.38s]  can right
[4765.38s -> 4777.41s]  He's in the can
[4789.73s -> 4794.59s]  Don't interrupt
[4812.45s -> 4813.73s]  I beg you
[4813.73s -> 4818.00s]  Would you look after this medallion? That's a nice medallion
[4819.28s -> 4822.48s]  All right, that's cool. I got a memory stone and a sacred tear
[4823.28s -> 4825.84s]  Oh, no, this old man's mind is fucking gone
[4826.99s -> 4828.99s]  Take this medallion, please
[4829.15s -> 4834.91s]  Like like a turd in his hand like oh, this is not what that is man
[4842.18s -> 4844.18s]  That's my first flask upgrade
[4846.00s -> 4849.84s]  I'm so glad you actually got one of those because if you didn't you actually might
[4850.48s -> 4852.48s]  It might be like a dead run
[4853.58s -> 4860.22s]  Needing to drink like six times eventually you might physically not be able to take more than like three hits. Yes pretty bad
[4860.46s -> 4862.42s]  It's been pretty bad
[4862.42s -> 4866.54s]  But I make do
[4866.54s -> 4868.14s]  Item in the coffin
[4868.14s -> 4871.26s]  Oh, I didn't pick it up. I was too busy watching my favorite movie
[4883.17s -> 4887.54s]  Trolls roar. I feel like that's I don't think i've seen that
[4889.81s -> 4898.05s]  It's fun, but bad
[4898.05s -> 4902.13s]  You know, I feel like that's the case with all from software games everything is fun
[4902.29s -> 4906.45s]  But bad except for two things and they're the best thing and don't ever use anything else
[4907.01s -> 4910.72s]  I just wish they made everything bad
[4910.88s -> 4912.88s]  Then you need to stop reading reddit
[4925.73s -> 4931.92s]  True. Hey one person said true one person said true. Yeah, because you didn't come up with that opinion yourself
[4936.50s -> 4941.94s]  What I can't just agree with some things I can't I have to does every single opinion have to be
[4942.42s -> 4946.26s]  A completely original opinion on something. You can't just agree with something
[4947.60s -> 4950.83s]  I mean
[4950.83s -> 4952.91s]  If you don't have what are you baiting me to jump off the cliff for?
[4956.03s -> 4961.07s]  I'm just saying like it's you probably wouldn't have that opinion if everyone on reddit didn't have the opinion that x thing
[4961.07s -> 4965.07s]  Is the good thing people don't try all of the things and then they repeat the one thing that's good
[4965.07s -> 4969.87s]  And then once that thing gets nerfed then someone goes wait a second this one other thing that thing is also good
[4969.95s -> 4971.31s]  Let's all do that
[4971.31s -> 4973.31s]  Yeah, and then that's the new thing
[4974.03s -> 4975.87s]  Okay, but it was always good
[4975.87s -> 4982.43s]  I would agree with you, but could you please use any of the crystal sorceries in the entire game?
[4983.71s -> 4989.33s]  None of them are good. You know could you know, I mean like which like which ones they're they're good, right?
[4990.64s -> 4992.32s]  There there's like
[4992.32s -> 4997.73s]  I I don't fit one which which ones are the crystal ones the ones that go like
[4998.53s -> 5004.50s]  The like machine gun ones. No, they're the purple crystal thing. It's it's okay
[5005.06s -> 5012.91s]  Glintstone is light blue crystal is purple ones purple. The purple shit sucks. All right
[5012.91s -> 5016.67s]  Well, i'm gonna okay. Let me fucking put on a different spell even glintstone
[5017.15s -> 5020.51s]  There's like a hundred glintstone moves and honestly
[5020.91s -> 5026.21s]  There's maybe three or four of them that are like good like good enough to like carry you through a playthrough
[5027.92s -> 5031.44s]  Good enough to carry you so you're not good. You need something good enough to carry you
[5033.15s -> 5039.33s]  I saw all capitals wrong and then all capitals true right next to each other. That's the worst take
[5039.89s -> 5041.81s]  I'm i'm gonna disagree with you
[5041.89s -> 5042.13s]  dude
[5042.13s -> 5047.17s]  I used rain of stars and I was so excited about it and everyone omega lulled at me because they thought they would like dude
[5047.17s -> 5049.73s]  You're an idiot that thing sucks and it was like one of the most expensive
[5050.29s -> 5058.72s]  Crystal spells in the whole game every time I got a crystal move. I looked over and just saw
[5059.52s -> 5062.88s]  Oh my god omega lull that thing sucks, dude. Oh my god
[5062.88s -> 5066.14s]  It's that's one of the worst spells in the game and I was like, okay
[5066.46s -> 5069.34s]  And I used it and it did like 40 damage and I was like, okay, that's suck
[5070.14s -> 5072.83s]  So I never used it ever again
[5075.02s -> 5077.10s]  I'm not doing a paul bearer impression was I?
[5077.90s -> 5080.27s]  Well, I think that's a very different take
[5080.99s -> 5086.35s]  Some things are bad instead of there's one or two good things and only use those or you're bad
[5086.99s -> 5088.99s]  I know you're very different than
[5090.53s -> 5092.53s]  Like this one spell isn't good
[5093.25s -> 5095.25s]  Well, hold on. There's there's a difference between
[5095.65s -> 5097.97s]  Like everything is bad. So only use the good thing
[5098.05s -> 5103.33s]  Otherwise, like I everyone would have just used rivers of blood only but I mean people kind of did that for a little while
[5104.37s -> 5105.17s]  but
[5105.17s -> 5108.29s]  Well, yeah, because people told him it was the only good thing for a while
[5108.45s -> 5110.45s]  That's all i'm saying is that it's it's uh
[5110.45s -> 5116.47s]  But if you went against rivers of blood if you were talking about like a pvp scenario you were automatically at a disadvantage
[5121.52s -> 5122.80s]  Got him
[5122.80s -> 5127.52s]  He's speechless. I mean, I don't know enough about the pvp and I don't think you did any pvp. So
[5128.24s -> 5133.74s]  I did a ton of pvp. Did you I did? Yeah
[5134.54s -> 5137.02s]  Sounds like you lost to a lot of people using rivers of blood
[5137.50s -> 5140.86s]  Oh, it'd be so easy if I just used that but like I don't want to because that's cheesy
[5140.94s -> 5143.34s]  So like i'm not gonna use it. I have no experience with how it actually is
[5143.34s -> 5147.90s]  But like if if you use that it's like so fucking lame. I lost to another rivers of blood user
[5147.98s -> 5152.54s]  I won't do it though. I never said that. Okay, you don't have to kind of writings on the wall
[5153.46s -> 5155.46s]  Oh, there's no writing on the wall
[5155.70s -> 5160.48s]  All I said is a lot of the stuff in this game is really fun to use
[5161.18s -> 5165.98s]  But no, no, don't say stir like winning stir. Like what a base take by stir
[5166.22s -> 5171.90s]  No renala's full moon if i'm the reddit guy if i'm the reddit guy, you're the chat guy. You're the chat guy
[5172.22s -> 5175.34s]  I'm the chat guy. Yeah, you're the check. If i'm the reddit guy, you're the chat guy
[5175.58s -> 5179.70s]  What does that what does that mean look over a chat and you're like, oh, that's what they're saying
[5179.78s -> 5181.78s]  All right. All right. I'm not gonna I got it
[5182.26s -> 5187.63s]  They're the same guy the reddit guy and the chat guy are the same guy
[5201.49s -> 5205.94s]  How why are you so good at this? I fucking hate you. Okay. All right, you ready?
[5206.90s -> 5213.49s]  So good at what i'm just like speaking common english. Why are you so good at this? All right, where are we going?
[5213.97s -> 5228.96s]  Oh, we missed a boss. That's right up in the village. It's too bad. That move is not very good
[5231.14s -> 5235.36s]  Uh, hold on as I think I also have the moon staff
[5236.93s -> 5239.33s]  I figure which one does like bonus moon damage
[5241.42s -> 5244.70s]  Uh, that move actually is fantastic. I used it for almost the whole playthrough
[5245.10s -> 5250.42s]  Is that's the the running moon one, right? Yeah, renala
[5251.47s -> 5256.59s]  Excuse me. Yeah, I have carrion regal scepter is the moon sorcery one
[5256.67s -> 5268.59s]  But I upgraded my carrion glidstone to 15. So how much um intelligence do you have right now enough?
[5270.38s -> 5272.38s]  It does not take like 70 to use
[5274.05s -> 5281.33s]  True. I shouldn't like another another thing that my randomizer did is it made all the requirements zero on spells really?
[5281.89s -> 5286.86s]  Yeah, dude. Your game is like so my game my game's fucked up, dude
[5287.66s -> 5289.66s]  Hold on. It's zero
[5289.66s -> 5291.90s]  Yeah, everything is the zero
[5291.90s -> 5296.46s]  I'm not using it dude. You could like at this point
[5297.12s -> 5301.94s]  I would change it but it would break everything and we'd have another like two hour delay
[5302.64s -> 5314.70s]  Nah, it's not worth it. Let's just have fun. We're having fun. You know, i'm not a fan
[5316.00s -> 5320.24s]  You know if we're gonna like change the topic of like where's hillary's emails right now
[5320.64s -> 5329.26s]  I I don't like stat requirements on things. I'm not a fan. I actually like it. Let's go you want to fucking debate
[5329.58s -> 5335.41s]  I you know what I love is that we both are really passionate about things that like don't matter. They don't matter
[5335.49s -> 5338.69s]  They don't matter at all. It's zero thinking back to the conversation
[5338.69s -> 5342.05s]  We had when we were playing ember where we just argued about like vampire survivors
[5342.85s -> 5348.45s]  For like an hour is like we both are always on the opposite side of the opinion
[5348.69s -> 5353.09s]  Like we both always disagree and are very passionate about something that does not matter at all
[5353.25s -> 5355.73s]  Yeah, it's actually really funny
[5355.73s -> 5358.21s]  And then I thought today I was like it's kind of weird though
[5358.21s -> 5362.21s]  Because if you ask us like what our favorite games are we're both like diablo 2 of bloodborne
[5362.53s -> 5366.61s]  Yeah, so we're like in total agreeance. Well, we're also
[5367.17s -> 5377.28s]  We don't agree on anything dude yin and yang have to exist. I'm sorry what they do the balance of the universe
[5377.44s -> 5388.14s]  I just got it right in the head
[5388.14s -> 5398.42s]  Here's the thing the things that we don't agree on like you said are so meaningless that neither one of us could truly get upset
[5398.42s -> 5404.50s]  By it, but also we're passionate enough to argue about it, but it's fun to talk. Yeah
[5405.54s -> 5414.10s]  We just annihilated that boss
[5414.10s -> 5415.86s]  Yep, he was nobody
[5415.86s -> 5424.42s]  Nobody and nothing
[5424.42s -> 5430.10s]  Are you suggesting the balance of the universe is being held up by youtube bickering about video games?
[5431.70s -> 5434.44s]  I don't know about you guys, but I feel like i'm the protagonist
[5435.49s -> 5437.41s]  And you're just like
[5437.41s -> 5439.70s]  npcs in my world
[5439.70s -> 5442.18s]  All right. You know what? I you really might be the main character
[5444.87s -> 5449.51s]  I I get I get a lot of I feel like a lot of side character energy coming off of me. You know what I mean?
[5451.91s -> 5454.23s]  I don't know. I think it goes back and forth yin and yang
[5454.39s -> 5457.51s]  But I feel we're the two main characters and we finally hook up in the end
[5457.91s -> 5460.87s]  But I feel like i'm not just stops watching i'm never a main character
[5460.87s -> 5464.55s]  But I feel like I I end up being every single side character like combined
[5467.51s -> 5469.75s]  The the comic relief like joke character
[5470.31s -> 5473.19s]  Nah, i'm like smart and i'm like kind of
[5474.68s -> 5476.68s]  Lillian
[5481.06s -> 5483.46s]  All right, I don't want to be a man I don't want to be the main character
[5483.54s -> 5488.34s]  That sounds like a lot of pressure and the main character all of their family friends and loved ones die
[5488.74s -> 5490.98s]  You don't want to be a main character. No, I don't want to be a man
[5491.06s -> 5496.18s]  Yeah, you really don't want to be a main character. I just want to be the chill buddy that like doesn't like just kind of like hey
[5496.58s -> 5498.50s]  Happy to see you
[5498.50s -> 5500.50s]  Sorry, your family died
[5502.04s -> 5505.00s]  Don't worry, you'll get the yakuza and being the main character is like
[5505.80s -> 5507.96s]  In the middle of a conversation. It's like, oh, yeah, blah blah blah
[5508.44s -> 5515.14s]  Every single other person is talking every character is talking and then eventually they all kind of go like this. What do you have to say?
[5515.94s -> 5517.60s]  your
[5517.60s -> 5519.84s]  Main character is like, oh, um
[5520.80s -> 5522.58s]  well
[5522.58s -> 5524.63s]  I think that
[5524.63s -> 5530.07s]  We should who did that? Oh over here
[5533.62s -> 5535.62s]  And see that's why
[5535.86s -> 5539.22s]  Full circle. That's why the terraria playthrough makes sense
[5540.34s -> 5545.99s]  I was the protag
[5545.99s -> 5552.98s]  All comes back to that
[5552.98s -> 5556.18s]  Yeah, I want to be I want to be one of the guys that eats dinner at the table
[5556.26s -> 5558.42s]  I don't want to be the one that has to decide on what we're eating
[5558.98s -> 5564.55s]  Because if I have to decide on what we're eating then, you know
[5564.55s -> 5566.55s]  There's gonna be three or four people at that table that are like
[5567.17s -> 5569.11s]  steak and onions
[5569.11s -> 5570.63s]  I wouldn't pick this
[5570.63s -> 5572.92s]  Is it but whose decision was this?
[5572.92s -> 5577.72s]  And then if you i'm at the table too, and i'm just like, oh, it's it's okay. I'm all right. I'm all right
[5578.44s -> 5580.44s]  It's all right. I am. Yeah
[5580.60s -> 5583.32s]  Yeah, I don't I don't want to be I don't have the person that's like hey
[5583.56s -> 5585.16s]  um, so
[5585.16s -> 5592.79s]  You were the one that ordered the lasagna for the table. Yeah, I like lasagna. I don't fucking like lasagna
[5593.43s -> 5597.43s]  Well, I just figured we would all eat it because it's it's pasta and sauce and it's
[5598.23s -> 5602.61s]  It's you don't want to be a cheese. I just don't want to make decisions for anybody
[5607.19s -> 5609.99s]  I don't want to be the main character
[5609.99s -> 5612.79s]  Oh, so like early on in this run when I was like, which direction do you want to go?
[5612.79s -> 5614.79s]  Where do you want to go?
[5614.79s -> 5618.63s]  That was upsetting scrambled eggs and pork chops are not good
[5621.04s -> 5623.04s]  Like that's the decision I would make
[5623.28s -> 5627.20s]  That sounds pretty good
[5627.20s -> 5631.60s]  I like making decisions on things that I very much know a lot about
[5632.40s -> 5634.76s]  Does that make sense?
[5634.76s -> 5640.60s]  I'm okay with being the main character in some very very specific places, but that's it. That's it
[5642.29s -> 5648.39s]  Don't ask me where we should eat. Don't ask me about anything else. What do I ask you about?
[5650.18s -> 5651.14s]  um
[5651.14s -> 5653.44s]  something like making like videos
[5654.08s -> 5656.84s]  well, I don't know like
[5656.84s -> 5659.68s]  I don't know like
[5659.68s -> 5662.08s]  Doing like streams like event streams. I know that
[5663.62s -> 5665.76s]  I know that very well
[5665.76s -> 5669.75s]  You got an event talk to me talk to me
[5670.87s -> 5673.09s]  Stepped on that thing
[5673.09s -> 5676.77s]  You want to know where we're going to go for food? Don't call me
[5677.25s -> 5682.37s]  You want my opinion on any other thing? You want my opinion on literally any other subject?
[5682.53s -> 5686.55s]  Don't talk to me my game might have crashed. Oh, yeah my game crashed
[5690.74s -> 5693.08s]  Only talk to me about my hyper fixation
[5693.78s -> 5697.14s]  You want to talk to me about like cereal mascots?
[5703.46s -> 5710.18s]  Did you actually crash I did yeah, are you dead? No, i'm just laughing at what you said
[5712.08s -> 5717.44s]  Okay, that was I thought that was the germa classic. I've done something dumb and I don't want him to know laugh
[5718.55s -> 5724.21s]  But that blended into the learning i'm relearning the styles
[5725.92s -> 5728.24s]  I'm all fucking around though like all jokes aside
[5729.86s -> 5735.36s]  It's I make decisions on a lot of things. It's just not i'd rather be somebody that contributes
[5735.76s -> 5742.77s]  I'm summoning I put the thing down. I respawn in the same spot where I crashed kind of
[5756.23s -> 5760.31s]  But I do have a cup like you said like whatever my things that I really care about
[5760.79s -> 5762.79s]  I will take the helm on it. I will
[5779.38s -> 5782.26s]  Drive the clown clown car until it stops working. Yeah
[5785.76s -> 5786.88s]  anyways
[5786.88s -> 5790.64s]  Where do I go to get a couple people to wrestle each other anyways?
[5791.36s -> 5794.40s]  The crystal abilities in this game are not good
[5795.49s -> 5799.59s]  Full circle is that full circle because you're kind of taking the wheel
[5800.63s -> 5803.43s]  And saying that they're not good, but also like you don't really know
[5804.77s -> 5807.25s]  I'm just i'm, you know, i'm trying to make a joke
[5808.55s -> 5811.43s]  It's not funny to me, dude
[5811.51s -> 5813.51s]  Maybe i'm not laughing
[5816.07s -> 5818.63s]  Oh, dude, it's a rock a cool rock in here
[5821.19s -> 5827.78s]  Honestly, I would have put that rock in this chest some of this like cool shiny rocks
[5827.86s -> 5834.29s]  Don't you think that's what would be in a chest so like in front of the goddess like offering statue
[5834.61s -> 5843.25s]  I'm going to give him a rock. I mean you're cursed for the rest of your life. What was in yours?
[5844.50s -> 5851.72s]  Smoldering butterfly, is that better? I mean it it could have some form of like religious
[5852.28s -> 5853.80s]  Like but a rock
[5853.80s -> 5861.25s]  But a special rock cannot have that was it a special rock or a rock new topic. Let's go
[5871.27s -> 5873.51s]  Uh, do you care about the dragon abilities?
[5873.91s -> 5882.40s]  I wish I did because the I I could get like the dragon communion seal and i've been I already have like a flame breath
[5882.40s -> 5888.92s]  But no because I do in faith. I can't drop them anyways. Never mind. Ooh
[5889.68s -> 5898.28s]  Yeah, I found like a whole bunch of the fire magic. I kind of
[5899.08s -> 5901.81s]  You know don't know where we're going
[5901.81s -> 5905.33s]  Collecting items some of these cats. No, there should be like a boss down here. Yeah
[5905.81s -> 5908.13s]  I think we we opened the door. It's down here somewhere
[5912.61s -> 5914.05s]  Try finger
[5914.05s -> 5917.89s]  But uh, what about what's it done?
[5918.21s -> 5927.94s]  Was there nothing else in here?
[5927.94s -> 5938.76s]  Unless there's another illusory wall
[5939.00s -> 5949.64s]  I don't think there is here
[5949.64s -> 5951.64s]  Look, I'm a lantern
[5951.80s -> 5953.80s]  Oh, yeah, it's it's kind of bright
[5956.68s -> 5963.00s]  It was behind you that guy said that and is like watching the stream on a delay and i'm on a delay
[5969.04s -> 5973.56s]  Um, you're kind of describing the problem. I was having earlier
[5973.56s -> 5977.08s]  I asked too many questions in a row and it was getting answers for the out of order
[5989.09s -> 5992.56s]  Yeah, what's going on here?
[5992.56s -> 5994.24s]  This is the entrance
[5994.24s -> 5996.24s]  You pulled the big heavy door lever
[6001.30s -> 6006.05s]  You guys having a good time?
[6006.05s -> 6008.28s]  Okay
[6008.28s -> 6016.18s]  Somewhere a heavy door has opened. Oh, I think maybe because the desync. Oh come to come here. Oh wait when you crashed
[6016.82s -> 6018.74s]  I think we never pulled that
[6018.74s -> 6023.83s]  Uh, because when you crashed out, it doesn't count technically, right? Yeah, come back up here
[6026.71s -> 6031.32s]  Up to the beginning. Yeah, I don't think we'd been down here
[6033.36s -> 6043.81s]  Nope, nothing in there. I mean, there's a heavy door somewhere. Hey, we're coming down these stairs
[6044.45s -> 6050.18s]  What? Sorry, I was I was when you when I was looking at chat. I'm sorry. I asked him a question
[6051.92s -> 6053.92s]  frozen lightning spear
[6054.95s -> 6056.85s]  I I got a spear too
[6056.85s -> 6061.11s]  No, like the magic frozen lightning spear. Oh I
[6061.83s -> 6065.19s]  You don't care about faith, right? Because I did get lightning spear dude
[6065.35s -> 6074.00s]  If we kill ranala, I might go like faith because I have so much faith stuff bills are losing
[6075.44s -> 6077.12s]  Oh, no
[6077.12s -> 6084.68s]  Shit, not my bills
[6085.44s -> 6100.32s]  Come on. Got him. That's a big wind-up
[6113.60s -> 6119.44s]  There's something weird about fighting a boss from what that's not actually attacking you trying to gauge how close you are
[6130.15s -> 6131.83s]  I forgot he did that
[6131.83s -> 6145.06s]  Please don't kill me
[6145.06s -> 6155.73s]  There's no way we can do this
[6155.73s -> 6158.13s]  Dude, i'm i'm sick of seeing these cookbooks
[6160.24s -> 6162.24s]  At some point you're gonna get every single cookbook
[6164.15s -> 6168.55s]  And then you're gonna get some cool stuff
[6168.55s -> 6175.88s]  Let him cook. We still don't have we don't have the crafting thing to craft or cook. There's no cooking going on common bills
[6176.36s -> 6183.70s]  l
[6183.86s -> 6196.34s]  I guess they're are they playing right now? All right. How are you doing? You're leveling up. I actually
[6196.90s -> 6200.72s]  I think I might be able to as well
[6200.72s -> 6204.32s]  It's gonna be close
[6204.32s -> 6207.36s]  17 18 000, I think it's 18
[6208.32s -> 6213.34s]  Or 19
[6213.34s -> 6228.51s]  Okay, what's my favorite vegetable to dice onions? Come on
[6232.83s -> 6236.35s]  Uh, sir, what's your favorite topping to go on a hot dog? I'll go first
[6238.26s -> 6239.78s]  mine is
[6239.78s -> 6243.62s]  Dice onions control of the conversation at this point and I don't even get to answer
[6244.10s -> 6247.14s]  what's your favorite by the way mine and you just keep talking and then
[6248.10s -> 6250.10s]  Like don't even care. What is it though?
[6251.38s -> 6253.46s]  No, what was yours yours first? It was yours was
[6255.10s -> 6256.06s]  Uh
[6256.06s -> 6257.50s]  diced onions
[6257.50s -> 6259.58s]  cold not grilled diced onions
[6260.98s -> 6262.98s]  And maybe a little bit of tabasco
[6264.00s -> 6268.70s]  and maybe maybe maybe a little mustard if I feel like it I
[6269.50s -> 6272.26s]  I would usually say like
[6272.26s -> 6274.26s]  I don't think opinion's gonna be wrong
[6274.66s -> 6276.66s]  But that was fucked up what you just said
[6278.02s -> 6285.73s]  Why what about what about just just tabasco on a hot dog or tabasco and ketchup? I don't know
[6285.73s -> 6287.73s]  I like never have tabasco at all
[6291.22s -> 6297.39s]  You know, it's really good. Um, like a uh, like pineapple I stuff pineapple
[6298.56s -> 6304.32s]  I think I would if I had my choice of like the perfect well-made dog. It would be uh, like chili
[6305.28s -> 6315.78s]  That's good because uh, I love sonic the hedgehog. He loves chili cheese dogs. I think yeah
[6316.34s -> 6323.65s]  So like the hedgehog likes oh, we're oh we're in I didn't even see it change. Um, this guy's pretty easy
[6324.05s -> 6328.29s]  What's normally even in these we've actually gotten pretty lucky on these. They're not bad at all
[6328.85s -> 6356.64s]  Please do we cast something please let me do something
[6357.28s -> 6362.72s]  God what the fuck can he just smash this controller down and he just threw his controller on the end of like the desk
[6363.86s -> 6388.40s]  I got a death root. I got literal shit. Do you think it's time to attempt the
[6390.03s -> 6392.90s]  the the wall
[6392.90s -> 6399.06s]  The wall, I think we're I think we might be able to attempt the the real wall of the playthrough
[6399.54s -> 6402.82s]  I feel like we're pretty strong. I think we can I want to finish going up left here
[6405.07s -> 6407.73s]  This is the uh, the teleport towers
[6409.62s -> 6411.62s]  Get to the end of this path and then we'll go fight
[6412.42s -> 6416.34s]  Placid u6 the queen of the moon and then followed by loretta
[6416.96s -> 6428.22s]  immediately after um
[6429.04s -> 6430.77s]  pineapple
[6430.77s -> 6437.25s]  Very very small pineapple chunks not the big rings or anything not like big chunks little pineapple chunks part of like almost like a
[6439.76s -> 6441.20s]  Like uh, oh man
[6441.20s -> 6445.30s]  I there used to be this place in new jersey where it all began
[6445.70s -> 6449.95s]  It was like they would make uh, like icies
[6450.75s -> 6451.95s]  like italian ices
[6451.95s -> 6455.31s]  But they would put like the chunks of the fruit in it and they had like a pineapple
[6455.61s -> 6464.24s]  Pina colada chunks of pineapple in it truly one of the goats hot dogs are it's weirdly enough hot dogs
[6464.24s -> 6467.36s]  are one of the only foods that wacky combinations I
[6468.24s -> 6471.50s]  Accept them and want them. I don't know what it is about hot dogs
[6471.50s -> 6475.74s]  But I think it's just hot dogs are just like ah, it's a bunch of just fucking random ass meat. It's okay
[6476.70s -> 6482.86s]  Disgusting is a hot dog to you if it has no bun and no no toppings. No, that's fine for me
[6483.42s -> 6486.62s]  Really? I I if I take like one bite i'm like i'm done
[6487.78s -> 6489.38s]  Well, that was that was enough
[6489.38s -> 6494.99s]  You just mean like just a hot dog with not but do you put it like hot dogs and beans or hot dogs and anything else?
[6495.15s -> 6500.03s]  Just no a hot a hot dog like if I hand you a cooked hot dog and i'm like eat this
[6500.51s -> 6502.91s]  Can you finish it? Yeah, I would i'd be able to
[6503.87s -> 6509.47s]  Like it's like same thing with bananas like a whole banana like bananas are too big. Let's be honest trees
[6509.47s -> 6514.48s]  What are you up to? Why is it that big? Do you want to use one of these?
[6514.56s -> 6518.40s]  Do we even have one of these we don't but there's like a bonfire up here. I just want to get it
[6519.17s -> 6521.57s]  Um, I think there's a chest on the top one
[6524.90s -> 6528.77s]  So funny how much people just flip on us this whole stream
[6530.69s -> 6535.65s]  Everyone was saying germa l like super germa l now everyone's saying stir l wow
[6536.13s -> 6543.09s]  Comment stir l a hot dog without a bun and you're just like yeah, I want to suck it straight down
[6543.25s -> 6547.25s]  I don't even chew them. Well, we're not doing like the I I I can shoot him like this
[6548.37s -> 6550.37s]  We're not doing that like meme video
[6553.23s -> 6557.87s]  I'm just saying okay. And again, it's not we're not talking like a sausage. It's not like a cheese filled
[6557.95s -> 6560.99s]  It's not it's like a just basic ass beef hot dog
[6563.12s -> 6564.32s]  I mean, I would not prefer it
[6564.32s -> 6566.32s]  But I okay if somebody was like hey
[6566.91s -> 6571.81s]  Well, how many times you've been in this have you been in this scenario before where you're at a barbecue or you're at a grill?
[6571.89s -> 6575.47s]  Like a family get together friend get together, whatever it is and oh, hey
[6575.47s -> 6580.59s]  Yeah, there's there's one or two hot dogs just left on the grill and there's no buns
[6581.47s -> 6585.07s]  It's too much time too much effort to go through that actual
[6585.85s -> 6589.23s]  Impossibility for me to eat those like a hot dog without a bun
[6589.47s -> 6595.55s]  It's they kind of gross me out hot dog with even like even a normal loaf of bread slice
[6596.19s -> 6602.70s]  Amazing. Yeah, but there's an on and off switch there for me. There's never been a scenario where you're just like, okay
[6602.70s -> 6606.94s]  There's only there's like a couple hot dogs left. I could still probably eat one and I don't really care
[6607.50s -> 6611.42s]  It's grilled hot dog. Yes, let me give it to me. I'll eat it. I'll eat in three bites easy
[6611.42s -> 6614.00s]  No, can't do it. I I would feel like throwing up
[6614.24s -> 6614.80s]  Okay
[6614.80s -> 6632.48s]  I would I don't prefer it but I would eat it especially if it's grilled if it's grilled that takes it up a couple tears
[6632.48s -> 6636.56s]  I think for me wanting to be able to do what we're talking about. Hey, you know, no one's perfect
[6640.08s -> 6646.14s]  What was your had a take about bananas? Oh, it's like the same thing like bananas are too big
[6646.62s -> 6652.93s]  I'll eat like a a big banana. I'll eat half of it and like that's enough. That's enough banana, right?
[6653.25s -> 6661.47s]  Can I change your whole life? Sure. Okay change my life germa. Do you who?
[6663.06s -> 6670.61s]  You're you're a smoothie fan, right? Yeah, you are. Yeah, are you like a banana smoothie fan? Yeah
[6671.01s -> 6671.81s]  Yeah, yeah
[6671.81s -> 6676.69s]  What I would do is I would like cut the banana in half but half the banana and freeze the rest
[6679.25s -> 6681.89s]  And then like the next time you have a smoothie you have like frozen banana
[6682.64s -> 6688.82s]  Yeah, but how much banana what kind of banana are you doing strawberry? But my game crashed. Oh
[6689.70s -> 6693.14s]  Strawberry banana is good. Yeah strawberry or blueberry
[6694.37s -> 6699.25s]  Uh, hopefully that didn't am I still yeah, i'm still alive. Okay. Um
[6700.82s -> 6706.64s]  Yeah, so strawberry banana strawberry. Do you do peanut butter banana peanut butter?
[6706.64s -> 6711.44s]  No, I had it once and it kind of grossed me out, but I also feel like I could come around to the peanut butter
[6712.22s -> 6716.67s]  Banana situation. I think that's you just you need to get the ratio right
[6717.63s -> 6719.87s]  A lot of people when they make a peanut butter banana smoothie
[6720.11s -> 6726.19s]  They make a huge mistake and they add just a shit load of peanut butter and it becomes this thick peanut butter shake
[6727.02s -> 6731.89s]  Light peanut butter extra banana. There's your there's the correct ratio you want less
[6732.45s -> 6739.28s]  Peanut butter versus banana for me. You know what? Maybe maybe this changes my life. Maybe it doesn't but i'll try it
[6742.99s -> 6747.17s]  Because I I think my first experience with the the peanut butter banana phenomena
[6748.26s -> 6751.54s]  Like I ordered a smoothie and was not expecting it like I didn't even know
[6752.56s -> 6757.50s]  And then I tasted it and was like and let me guess it was like how dare you it was like how dare you
[6758.14s -> 6760.51s]  You had to like kind of tip it back and it was like
[6760.83s -> 6766.29s]  Like it was like sludge almost right a little bit. You're right. That's what i'm saying. Oh through a straw
[6766.37s -> 6771.55s]  It's like do I gotta reinvite you or something? Yeah, I think you have probably put a new thing down here
[6771.79s -> 6777.66s]  I'm gonna i'm gonna use the banishing ball. You guys don't talk case when like you here's the straw and it's like
[6778.22s -> 6792.40s]  Peanut butter banana smoothie peanut butter, right? That's a pretty bad sound. Are you still trying to like make more?
[6793.34s -> 6794.62s]  No
[6794.62s -> 6797.82s]  Farming, are you trying to make more sound effects?
[6798.46s -> 6802.38s]  I don't know if it really should count as a category if you're just like intentionally farming it
[6802.62s -> 6809.94s]  I have to read this but no, I don't it was so stupid
[6810.42s -> 6813.54s]  But uh, i'm gonna read it because like it's contextually funny
[6814.94s -> 6818.38s]  Uh, but no, i'm not gonna read it. I've already said it so I have to read it
[6818.46s -> 6823.66s]  Oh my you have to now you're somebody said bro, it's not your suck game is just really bad
[6826.91s -> 6832.70s]  No, but it's possible. I wouldn't want to rule anything out
[6834.46s -> 6836.46s]  You don't want to be sitting. All right
[6836.86s -> 6841.82s]  All right, first step focus focus focus up or maybe don't focus. We've been doing pretty well
[6841.90s -> 6847.66s]  Just rambling. Yeah when we don't focus lightning three light. I ain't gonna get hit. Whoa, that was different
[6851.01s -> 6853.01s]  All right, placid do sex
[6853.25s -> 6856.64s]  I'm doing so much more damage
[6857.36s -> 6861.84s]  Oh my god, this is gonna be all right. I took a hit but you know what who gives a shit
[6865.01s -> 6867.01s]  Quick quick talk about onions or something
[6868.48s -> 6871.68s]  Uh, so my favorite thing about onions is the way they make you cry
[6875.76s -> 6877.76s]  Like a bow
[6898.75s -> 6903.63s]  Just honest this felt so fucking easy, dude, don't say that now
[6904.51s -> 6911.28s]  See you you said that instead of talking about like something dumb and goofy and now now look what happened
[6915.81s -> 6917.73s]  I got like
[6917.73s -> 6922.64s]  Games laggy
[6922.64s -> 6924.64s]  That shouldn't have exploded on me
[6925.09s -> 6928.29s]  This game's fucking broken my game's broke. It's a broken game
[6936.19s -> 6938.19s]  Where is he?
[6944.14s -> 6946.14s]  Where okay
[6946.59s -> 6949.58s]  Playing hard to get
[6949.58s -> 6953.97s]  Mind you how did that miss lasers?
[6955.07s -> 6962.94s]  No, it's the fire
[6962.94s -> 6976.58s]  Watch the tail swipe
[6976.58s -> 6981.30s]  Um, he's stuck up there and he's doing he's doing lasers up there. This could ruin the whole thing
[6982.75s -> 6988.27s]  I don't even he's stuck inside of the I don't know how we're gonna do this. He's he'll come down eventually
[6988.99s -> 6990.99s]  I might even be able to no I my
[6991.63s -> 6993.63s]  Pebbles don't go far enough to the wall
[6994.67s -> 6996.67s]  Oh, that's too bad. We could have just cheesed him
[7000.58s -> 7009.97s]  Thank god. All right
[7009.97s -> 7021.09s]  lasers
[7021.09s -> 7022.69s]  my eyes
[7022.69s -> 7024.69s]  All right focus up
[7025.20s -> 7026.72s]  focus focus
[7026.72s -> 7028.88s]  focus on the prize
[7028.88s -> 7030.91s]  we're at um
[7030.91s -> 7067.74s]  This is it. This shouldn't be too bad. You really shouldn't skipping spammer
[7079.22s -> 7093.02s]  Remember forward dodge forward on those. Ow
[7093.89s -> 7097.55s]  Damn, he got you good
[7097.55s -> 7098.91s]  Oh my goodness
[7098.91s -> 7116.19s]  That's weird. Oh
[7116.19s -> 7128.51s]  All right. Here comes second phase. I'm out of heals just play defensive if you have to
[7138.19s -> 7142.03s]  Uh, I hate to be weird and and or cringe. I have never fought this boss
[7144.62s -> 7145.66s]  Uh-oh
[7145.66s -> 7148.67s]  I don't know this second phase
[7149.41s -> 7151.41s]  What have you?
[7151.73s -> 7154.45s]  That one I question i'm i'm confused on that one
[7155.58s -> 7157.58s]  I'm pretty sure there's a speedrun skip
[7159.02s -> 7161.02s]  I learned it and I just skipped the boss
[7163.41s -> 7165.89s]  Oh, wait, no. No by the time you fight this boss
[7165.97s -> 7171.73s]  You're so powerful that like I actually won like like stun locked insta phased it every time I fought it
[7172.21s -> 7174.77s]  So, you know I have fought this boss, but I haven't seen like
[7175.57s -> 7177.57s]  I didn't know there was even a second phase
[7178.53s -> 7184.27s]  It's kind of more what's getting me
[7184.27s -> 7186.27s]  All right. We got we got it. We're good
[7187.15s -> 7192.82s]  Nice
[7192.82s -> 7195.42s]  I got
[7195.42s -> 7203.49s]  We actually got some I got a lot of shit. I think I got one of the full medallions
[7205.97s -> 7211.46s]  I have a sacred tear as well. I don't know if that was from earlier. That's a big deal
[7215.92s -> 7218.35s]  Okay
[7221.87s -> 7233.36s]  I like this weapon. I like the thing it's doing. Yeah, I don't want a blood weapon
[7234.08s -> 7236.64s]  Stones
[7239.04s -> 7244.34s]  I'm honestly, uh, i'm debating if I should like switch to faith because I have so much good faith stuff
[7245.03s -> 7248.47s]  Uh, this is the opportunity for us to both go. What do we actually want to do?
[7252.93s -> 7257.33s]  I guess if I do strength, I mean if i'm gonna have like 50 points in strength anyways
[7258.05s -> 7262.21s]  Then this thing's I could still use this if I wanted to
[7270.90s -> 7272.90s]  This thing is cool
[7272.90s -> 7277.43s]  What's the what are my options my actual options?
[7278.15s -> 7285.32s]  This is regular smithing stones. This is somber this is somber, but this is faith
[7291.48s -> 7294.04s]  I like having one of each type of uh stone
[7294.60s -> 7299.16s]  Oh, I have the uh rolled medallion for the grand lift of rolled. I have it fully completed
[7299.72s -> 7309.80s]  So we can do that at some point i'll do these two
[7310.66s -> 7312.84s]  so I need to make I need 16
[7312.92s -> 7316.34s]  int 50 strength and then
[7317.49s -> 7323.65s]  Just this just scales off of strength and i'll be good to go. I want to see what this weapon art is
[7323.97s -> 7331.01s]  What about the god slayer?
[7332.42s -> 7334.74s]  Are you going faith because we maybe we shouldn't do the same thing
[7335.30s -> 7339.78s]  Ari, I i'm I I really want to use sorceries. I'm I'm thinking i'm not switching
[7341.38s -> 7349.72s]  I have a lot of good stuff I could do if I did switch but I really don't actually want to so if you do
[7350.44s -> 7354.10s]  Okay
[7354.10s -> 7369.19s]  I now it's coming down to uh coming down to aesthetics now for me cool this thing you raise up and you smash it and um
[7369.75s -> 7380.87s]  Fire comes out right what this sword it's like the magma worm sword. Okay, that's pretty cool
[7381.19s -> 7390.53s]  Yeah, this thing is really really cool looking
[7398.28s -> 7408.60s]  Damn, this thing is pretty sick. I don't know swing it. Uh, we need to leave this area
[7409.24s -> 7413.46s]  The god slayer is dex
[7413.86s -> 7422.76s]  This is pretty fast for this kind of weapon
[7424.56s -> 7429.44s]  I can't remember if this is good or super bad scar the rotten crystal sword builds up scarlet rot
[7430.00s -> 7436.10s]  I can't remember if scarlet rot actually matters against bosses and things it does
[7437.46s -> 7442.02s]  If you get scarlet rot on a boss, it's takes a ton of damage away, especially if they're susceptible to it
[7445.99s -> 7447.99s]  Dex and yeah, this is a lot of dex
[7461.08s -> 7463.88s]  I'm looking at you really weirdly, but you know what I mean?
[7465.59s -> 7470.23s]  You're looking at me weirdly. No, I looked at the camera like directly into it like kind of like a like a weirdo
[7471.09s -> 7475.94s]  um
[7475.94s -> 7479.38s]  No, this is annoying. I think i've made my decision
[7480.20s -> 7495.84s]  Let's um, let's go to the blacksmith. I think i've made my decision
[7499.78s -> 7502.10s]  Uh, yeah, hold on. Let me go back blacksmith. He said
[7502.90s -> 7504.21s]  Yeah
[7504.21s -> 7508.34s]  Unless you're respecting like right now and you're sure of it. No, you could do that first
[7514.68s -> 7519.08s]  Yes, I am. All right. So i'm gonna be using the magma worm, uh scale sword
[7519.40s -> 7525.62s]  That's the weapon i'm choosing for the remainder of our run. Are you going like full strength attacking man?
[7525.78s -> 7529.06s]  I'm just going full super strength with a little bit of faith
[7530.82s -> 7534.10s]  To be able to use the magma guillotine ability
[7534.74s -> 7539.94s]  Oh kind of it kind of does make me actually want to go like fire caster and then we could be the like the magma brothers
[7542.18s -> 7545.22s]  Yeah, that'd be cool. The only problem is what if we find somebody that's immune?
[7546.64s -> 7552.56s]  Um, all right, let's do this. Yeah when lister the tormentor accidentally like just rolls immune to fire
[7553.33s -> 7557.08s]  He's like dude, come on. I'm a fucking meteor build
[7558.31s -> 7561.35s]  Okay, so let's get how much I should have at least what?
[7561.99s -> 7566.50s]  Yeah, you are you are saying a bunch of stuff that I like know. Okay. Okay
[7572.58s -> 7577.22s]  Okay, you are saying things that I know that's great cool
[7578.02s -> 7580.02s]  Oh, that's that's crazy
[7582.10s -> 7586.52s]  Oh, man, man, that's crazy. Let me look over my shit if I actually did a switcheroo
[7586.82s -> 7602.64s]  It's uh, I need 15 decks to put this on and then how much now this doesn't tell how much faith do I need here?
[7603.27s -> 7607.43s]  Here's what's gonna happen. I'm banishing you. No, no, no, no, don't do that yet
[7607.75s -> 7614.88s]  But whatever we're gonna have like a a resource management session
[7615.44s -> 7665.70s]  I think we should just like banish so that we can go to round table. Hold I now
[7669.97s -> 7675.91s]  Yep, let's see. I want to I don't think i've ever seen this moves weapons move before I feel like I have
[7676.31s -> 7688.34s]  Because I why don't why would I know what it is? Well, uh, that's fucking cool and it stays there
[7688.74s -> 7703.72s]  That's a great initiator. Watch this. Look what I can do now. Yeah, you do that in real life. You would die
[7703.88s -> 7705.72s]  That's not realistic at all
[7705.72s -> 7714.88s]  The lava would burn you. Yeah, that's right. That's true. I shouldn't like that. I shouldn't enjoy that anymore
[7715.76s -> 7718.71s]  It was yeah, you're right. What should I like?
[7719.97s -> 7725.01s]  Tell me what I should like then what what you should like? Yeah, because that was that's like not realistic and stupid
[7725.01s -> 7727.01s]  But what should I tell me what I should like?
[7727.33s -> 7729.73s]  No, you can like it, but it's not realistic
[7730.29s -> 7731.73s]  oh
[7731.73s -> 7733.75s]  All right. Do you want to like?
[7733.75s -> 7737.35s]  Disconnect from each other and then just upgrade and stuff and then get back to it
[7738.31s -> 7740.87s]  Or what do you want to do? Are you did you respect?
[7744.07s -> 7747.68s]  Uh, no, I didn't well go do what you need to do
[7748.24s -> 7763.83s]  The jumping r2 has wide range. I think a wide kind of area. It has a follow-up. Yeah
[7768.20s -> 7774.26s]  Whoa, it does
[7774.26s -> 7789.86s]  It's that move that the magma worm does that's cool. All right. Can I how much can I upgrade this?
[7800.53s -> 7802.53s]  It does a lot of damage good
[7804.45s -> 7809.54s]  I don't know
[7809.54s -> 7815.92s]  Okay, I need somber smithing stone five. That's the hang up here
[7818.68s -> 7821.00s]  Um, yeah, I don't have that either. Yeah
[7822.04s -> 7824.96s]  I'll double check
[7824.96s -> 7826.24s]  180
[7826.24s -> 7832.96s]  I don't this is still I think technically better right because it has the fire the separate fire damage
[7833.60s -> 7849.54s]  Maybe the ball bearings maybe now for the remainder of this. Do I put any more points in faith?
[7852.07s -> 7854.37s]  Or should I just start dumping?
[7854.37s -> 7860.45s]  stuff in um
[7860.45s -> 7863.59s]  No, just dumping into
[7863.83s -> 7888.37s]  Into vigor or endurance probably i'll get bigger to 30 now does that so what what's your plan?
[7888.45s -> 7890.45s]  Tell us we're dying to know
[7892.96s -> 7896.88s]  Wait, what what's your what's your plan here? What do you what you what weapon are you trying to look at?
[7896.88s -> 7900.16s]  What do you what's your strategy? I think i'm just gonna keep doing what i'm doing
[7900.64s -> 7921.32s]  Just kind of looking around what the shops are selling. This is a great weapon
[7923.54s -> 7931.65s]  I think I should buy this
[7931.65s -> 7932.69s]  this too
[7932.69s -> 7951.86s]  Um, you might as well just buy make sure you um in the shop. Make sure you're buying the flask
[7952.34s -> 7957.38s]  Stuff is showing up randomly in shops for me. Yeah, our shops are different
[7957.62s -> 7963.44s]  Yeah, but just in case they're showing up in yours, too. If I see an item in a shop, that's good
[7963.60s -> 8005.60s]  I will I will buy it. This one's this one's d. This is pretty standard
[8012.96s -> 8016.56s]  Is this the same guy that growled at us and turned purple yeah
[8018.42s -> 8022.66s]  It is I can't deny that if I would just if I was if I said no
[8023.30s -> 8026.44s]  No, I I didn't do that. You'd be like, what are you talking about?
[8026.76s -> 8031.56s]  I am the guy that growled at somebody in chat and my face turned purple
[8031.80s -> 8040.61s]  It's this video evidence of this happening. So I can't say it didn't happen
[8041.25s -> 8054.56s]  I can't say that it didn't happen. You could have just not read that
[8055.12s -> 8059.76s]  Yeah, but then it's fun to read chat. I like I like reading just random chat messages fun
[8063.28s -> 8065.44s]  Obviously if it's like a fun comment
[8066.26s -> 8083.72s]  Right. Okay. I am officially ready to continue whenever you are. I need a moment. I killed d
[8084.28s -> 8087.48s]  Well, you killed him
[8087.48s -> 8092.92s]  Like I I one of the merchants had his quest item and then he dies or was that roger?
[8093.00s -> 8095.32s]  I don't know and then fia like vanished
[8097.59s -> 8099.59s]  Who knows how these quests work?
[8100.92s -> 8104.37s]  It's actually so cool that you don't know any of this
[8106.61s -> 8108.61s]  I like I like vaguely know
[8110.24s -> 8117.89s]  Almost everything but like vaguely. What is this clip? Everyone's linking that art? No
[8121.94s -> 8125.96s]  Just dumping into
[8125.96s -> 8130.00s]  Into vigor that sir was making a sound effect. He was just
[8132.31s -> 8133.43s]  No, no
[8133.43s -> 8136.07s]  sir, did you or did you not like a few minutes ago go like
[8137.35s -> 8140.55s]  Like you pressed your lips together and did like a kind of like an elephant sound
[8141.57s -> 8143.70s]  There it is
[8143.70s -> 8150.60s]  See, they thought you fart it. Yeah, they thought I farted when you did that into vigor see no
[8151.24s -> 8158.53s]  Sometimes when i'm lifting weights, I do that by accident and my wife laughs at me. You gotta you gotta breathe man
[8159.25s -> 8161.25s]  Well, like you know, you got a brace
[8161.78s -> 8164.58s]  I know then you like the air releases and
[8165.46s -> 8173.38s]  You elephant a little bit stop replaying it. It's gross. It's not real. All right
[8173.86s -> 8178.20s]  It's not real. I need to I need to jump. What should I do?
[8178.68s -> 8190.21s]  You know, I know what i'm gonna do. Oh the crafting isn't random. I know exactly what i'm gonna do
[8191.81s -> 8199.03s]  Where is it? Is it not open yet? Where's that room chat that there it is. Okay. Do you have any smithing sevens?
[8199.92s -> 8208.77s]  Just regular ones. Yeah, I do not. Okay. Once I get some sevens i'm gonna fully
[8209.39s -> 8237.70s]  Unleash I feel like you probably are i'm good. I guess i'm ready. I don't I didn't really do anything
[8239.30s -> 8244.98s]  Uh, if you want to just dump some of your stones, do you have any stone sword keys? I do bottom
[8246.53s -> 8250.93s]  Down in the basement. Well, we shouldn't have to use both if you are have you already used yours
[8251.43s -> 8256.63s]  I just opened the chest down here at the round table in the basement
[8256.63s -> 8261.40s]  There's the two what I mean is like you should have been in we should have been together when you did that
[8261.64s -> 8277.72s]  Which fair kind of onion? Uh, I don't know. I can't really tell the difference. There's always like white onion yellow
[8277.80s -> 8283.24s]  I can't I don't really I can't really tell. Yeah, it's kind of tricky. Sometimes red onions. Yeah, not a big thing. No
[8284.20s -> 8286.44s]  I'll go yellow onion the yeah
[8287.72s -> 8290.15s]  Purple onion, whatever it is, right?
[8290.15s -> 8291.35s]  I want just
[8291.35s -> 8298.79s]  Yo, um
[8298.79s -> 8304.32s]  Ready? Yeah, i'm ready. See you see what i'm gonna do right now is i'm gonna invite you to my game
[8304.56s -> 8309.12s]  How do I donate? Uh don't wow
[8311.24s -> 8315.80s]  You're gonna come to my game and then i'm gonna give the death fruit to the guy because he's gonna give us an item
[8315.88s -> 8320.42s]  And I want us both to get it. Okay, is your thing done? Yeah
[8326.74s -> 8340.23s]  I'm coming in what's wrong the way i'm walking. I've actually been walking like this
[8340.23s -> 8343.99s]  So it's extra funny to me french onion soup is good
[8344.55s -> 8350.32s]  You gotta be in the mood for french onion soup because it's just kind of salt. It's just a very salty flavor
[8350.32s -> 8352.32s]  It's very good flavor, but it's very salty
[8353.33s -> 8366.39s]  All right, ready r1 r1 r1 r1. Was it worth it? No, I didn't nothing. I didn't get anything
[8366.63s -> 8375.16s]  Oh, I thought you would get it. Your theory was very sound in a lot of different potential hypothesis
[8375.24s -> 8390.71s]  Let's kill this boat guy. We've probably got the damage now and we do does he have more health than he's had before
[8392.08s -> 8395.76s]  He had a lot before oh my god. We are doing thousands of damage to him
[8405.41s -> 8408.29s]  He did he scale higher or something for some reason?
[8408.93s -> 8413.65s]  No, this is about this. This makes sense. Does it I feel like he doesn't have this much hp
[8418.45s -> 8422.82s]  That didn't even do that much
[8422.82s -> 8425.06s]  And yes, he absolutely did did he?
[8425.70s -> 8432.24s]  Watch out skeleton
[8432.24s -> 8435.76s]  I know you've heard me say this a few times but um, now i'm not gonna say it
[8436.40s -> 8444.47s]  all right
[8444.47s -> 8446.47s]  But uh, are you?
[8446.95s -> 8449.67s]  Am I you being are you absorbed? Are you being?
[8450.23s -> 8452.15s]  I look we're we're concentrating. I can't speak
[8453.27s -> 8458.23s]  I'm am I being absorbed like the theory that I remember when I was like, oh no
[8458.23s -> 8460.95s]  I'm not gonna say it. I can't say it and you're like, yeah now you have to though
[8462.85s -> 8466.21s]  No, I realized also what I was gonna say was like you're factually incorrect
[8468.05s -> 8470.15s]  And I didn't want to be spreading misinformation
[8471.33s -> 8474.68s]  Good of you on the internet. It's good of you
[8476.05s -> 8488.10s]  I try
[8488.10s -> 8490.18s]  Can is there? Oh, yeah, there is a backstab you can do
[8491.20s -> 8493.12s]  Oh, no, I thought you just did it
[8493.12s -> 8497.84s]  No, there is i'm pretty sure there is but I didn't do it. That's my the glint stone special
[8498.64s -> 8513.41s]  So maybe not. I don't think I don't think so
[8518.63s -> 8521.67s]  Use your weapon art. I have no fp. Does it use fp?
[8524.13s -> 8529.01s]  Probably. Yeah, it does
[8529.01s -> 8532.21s]  It's a good thing. He only summoned the skeleton for like one attack. Yeah
[8533.23s -> 8536.85s]  88 000 souls dude, what is going on right now?
[8537.65s -> 8539.73s]  Is uh, he's a pretty
[8540.53s -> 8542.77s]  I mean that was more than radon's memory
[8543.65s -> 8547.67s]  So that's coming here and level up. Holy shit
[8548.47s -> 8569.64s]  That guy was rich. I feel like that's the safe thing to do
[8570.69s -> 8572.53s]  This is the thing I want to do
[8572.53s -> 8578.48s]  I think that well, let's do safe
[8579.35s -> 8589.92s]  20 endurance get to 30 bigger and be good to go and then let's play safe. Let's do it safe. Let's do
[8590.88s -> 8592.00s]  safe
[8592.00s -> 8604.53s]  Okay. Well, that was a big deal. Um
[8606.76s -> 8608.92s]  I don't know if you want to fight stuff here. This is kind of like
[8610.80s -> 8612.84s]  you know
[8612.84s -> 8614.84s]  the logical place to go is
[8616.15s -> 8618.15s]  up over to
[8618.15s -> 8621.03s]  plateau
[8621.03s -> 8626.63s]  We could just stay. I mean, this is technically I think I have a teleporter that goes to red wait
[8627.11s -> 8630.31s]  I don't know southern k-lit is where we need to be. We need to kill radan
[8632.00s -> 8635.11s]  Oh, that stinks
[8635.11s -> 8636.87s]  Yeah, I should have
[8636.87s -> 8642.34s]  What I don't know why I don't I ran all the way and got the radon waypoint and I don't have it
[8644.55s -> 8649.43s]  I want to go fight radon just to see like it's gonna be like a random guy in the middle of the desert
[8650.39s -> 8653.27s]  That's right. Why am I concerned about this? All right, let's um
[8654.31s -> 8656.55s]  Inner ionia is the closest i've got
[8657.67s -> 8659.01s]  Really?
[8659.01s -> 8669.68s]  You don't have the under stairs or the oh no, that's uh, yeah, I know what you mean radan's not active yet. Oh
[8670.32s -> 8672.32s]  We didn't kill godfrey
[8673.12s -> 8674.24s]  Wait, no
[8674.24s -> 8680.36s]  We need to kill godric. We know we did kill godric. Didn't we? Yeah, we did. Yeah, we did
[8682.66s -> 8687.38s]  It's weird because it's all randomized. So we don't even know where what like how what progress we're on
[8690.55s -> 8691.59s]  what's the
[8691.59s -> 8695.64s]  Yeah, we need to go to the plateau
[8695.64s -> 8700.44s]  Also, there's a boss right inside here if you want to do that because we're like, I think it was a dragon. Let's do it
[8701.91s -> 8706.88s]  To your right. I didn't want to go in here because I thought it was the commander and I hate the fight
[8707.36s -> 8711.60s]  But like it's not
[8711.60s -> 8725.56s]  That fight was really annoying
[8725.64s -> 8730.08s]  Is this even him this is the glint stone dragon, oh I got comet
[8730.88s -> 8735.24s]  That's actually a huge deal
[8735.68s -> 8737.12s]  Comet azure
[8737.12s -> 8740.37s]  Just comet isn't comet azure like the crazy one
[8750.64s -> 8751.84s]  Holy shit
[8751.84s -> 8760.13s]  I don't know why I thought that was a good idea guys behind us like throwing shit out
[8760.93s -> 8762.93s]  Oh, that's oh there is
[8764.29s -> 8765.97s]  They fucking got me
[8765.97s -> 8768.13s]  This guy's throwing like boomerangs over here
[8769.01s -> 8774.52s]  There's a guy with a ballista too
[8774.68s -> 8780.48s]  You want me to well i'm dead anyways, never mind
[8780.96s -> 8782.16s]  Okay
[8782.16s -> 8785.92s]  I'm not sure that was even the boss because I I don't know. I think it is
[8797.92s -> 8801.44s]  Jesus jesus
[8801.44s -> 8822.24s]  Shit i'm like trapped. Okay. There we go. This is weird. This doesn't feel right. That's better. Okay, uh
[8824.16s -> 8826.34s]  Where we going we're gonna kill this
[8826.74s -> 8830.66s]  Uh, did you rest to get rid of your debuff if you had it? That's thank you
[8834.34s -> 8836.34s]  Why are you handcuffed to the chair?
[8837.22s -> 8841.54s]  That yeah, it's like what's happening. I can't get out of here. Oh, no, it wasn't the boss
[8845.94s -> 8847.94s]  It's a magma worm
[8848.96s -> 8852.82s]  Commander magma worm. It's a commander this time
[8857.27s -> 8858.47s]  well
[8858.47s -> 8859.59s]  Okay
[8859.59s -> 8863.91s]  I'm not seeing the names of things when you fight them, which is why I don't know the names of anything
[8865.40s -> 8867.00s]  You don't see it on the helper?
[8867.00s -> 8869.76s]  Nope
[8869.76s -> 8873.04s]  Like when it's a real like boss and it has an actual health bar
[8874.00s -> 8876.96s]  This one is just like a normal enemy health bar to me really
[8878.24s -> 8879.12s]  Yeah
[8879.12s -> 8898.02s]  Let's get off the horse. It's like makes it harder
[8899.32s -> 8901.32s]  Uh, I don't know what i'm being scarlet rotted by
[8902.28s -> 8906.42s]  Is it the guy throwing boomerangs?
[8906.42s -> 8907.78s]  I don't know
[8907.78s -> 8910.50s]  It's still going up like what fire versus fire
[8911.30s -> 8915.83s]  There's something on the ground like what is happening to me
[8916.63s -> 8935.83s]  Okay, I guess just like the flowers on the ground do that. I've never seen that
[8936.79s -> 8948.72s]  I probably shouldn't be doing that because some of that fire is mine and will not hurt you
[8949.52s -> 8951.76s]  I'm like putting traps down for you
[8953.14s -> 8955.14s]  Doing a little bit of deception
[8967.84s -> 8969.60s]  Did I not hit that at all?
[8969.60s -> 8971.60s]  Yeah, I do. I have scarlet rot now, too
[8972.00s -> 8974.00s]  Yeah, standing in the flowers
[8974.08s -> 8976.32s]  On the edges of this arena are scarlet rot
[8977.28s -> 8978.24s]  Shit
[8978.24s -> 8984.90s]  Oh, did you actually get a full build up?
[8985.06s -> 8987.06s]  Yeah, I did. I wasn't paying attention to it
[8987.38s -> 8991.92s]  You don't have a cure. I do
[8992.00s -> 9010.42s]  Got a lot better at that timing. Yes, it got me with it
[9011.22s -> 9013.62s]  Oh, I thought he was going the other way. I thought he's swinging that way
[9035.40s -> 9037.40s]  We're kind of pros at killing magma
[9038.92s -> 9041.73s]  Like it's the only boss in the game
[9055.46s -> 9057.38s]  Oh
[9057.38s -> 9059.38s]  He killed me be careful
[9060.08s -> 9065.78s]  I couldn't see where he was swinging it
[9065.78s -> 9066.82s]  Oh
[9066.82s -> 9071.68s]  I thought he killed you for a second
[9071.68s -> 9074.32s]  Okay
[9074.32s -> 9078.32s]  Yeah, I just saw I was just looking at his stomach and I was trying to gauge off of
[9078.96s -> 9082.64s]  When he was gonna swing by his like stomach undulations and I got it wrong
[9086.26s -> 9088.26s]  He's undulating. He's undulating
[9088.74s -> 9089.70s]  so
[9089.70s -> 9092.10s]  Do I get so I get souls for that?
[9092.66s -> 9098.10s]  Weird right because technically i'm not sure I thought that I did when you killed the dragon that one time and I was dead
[9098.10s -> 9099.86s]  During it, but then my souls were on the ground
[9099.86s -> 9105.75s]  So I think the souls that you were supposed to get you have to pick up now. I actually don't know
[9105.99s -> 9109.35s]  I think that yeah, I have zero. Oh, all right. That makes sense
[9110.07s -> 9112.07s]  All right, I get it
[9119.36s -> 9123.28s]  Wait, why they oh, okay
[9123.84s -> 9129.96s]  I was looking at chat. Oh, uh, we came here to go do radan. I
[9131.32s -> 9133.32s]  You gotta remember sometimes i'm just kind of like
[9133.56s -> 9137.80s]  Walking forward and looking this way to look at what you guys are talking about. I want to be part of a conversation
[9137.80s -> 9139.32s]  I want to see what you guys are saying
[9139.32s -> 9141.32s]  What are you guys saying?
[9153.52s -> 9155.04s]  all right
[9155.04s -> 9159.52s]  I feel like people are coming into my chat first time chat from user
[9160.00s -> 9162.00s]  Did he ever mention the blender he uses?
[9162.64s -> 9164.64s]  like they're just like trying to get me to like
[9164.72s -> 9167.36s]  Like bait me into talking about some psycho shit you do
[9168.24s -> 9170.31s]  Is that what they do here?
[9170.31s -> 9174.12s]  Is that what you guys do?
[9174.12s -> 9176.12s]  You guys just be like, oh, hey, dude. Um
[9177.68s -> 9180.08s]  Do you ever played mouse trap the game?
[9180.64s -> 9183.52s]  Like oh, yeah, I played mouse trap and let's talk about it. Is that what you guys do?
[9184.24s -> 9190.88s]  I go. Hey man, like I just got uh back from uh, I just I just took like a flight to
[9191.12s -> 9195.28s]  To miami and I had like some of the best, uh, like pizza i've ever had you like pizza
[9195.84s -> 9200.24s]  Well, I maybe i'm reading too much into it that I feel like you have a blender story
[9201.04s -> 9203.09s]  No
[9203.09s -> 9207.73s]  Okay, then he's legitimately wondering what your blender is because he says he made a smoothie and it was bad
[9208.72s -> 9210.72s]  It's I think he needs advice
[9211.04s -> 9213.04s]  Wait, hold on
[9213.04s -> 9218.00s]  Way wrong. Hold on a second. Somebody came into your chat and asked. Hey, man. I made a wicked fucked up smoothie
[9218.00s -> 9224.00s]  It sucked. What do I do? 30 minutes ago was like, yeah, I like smoothies, too
[9225.03s -> 9225.91s]  uh
[9225.91s -> 9227.91s]  What blender does he use?
[9228.87s -> 9231.19s]  Why what why who is what silver tier?
[9233.51s -> 9236.26s]  What is this red name?
[9236.26s -> 9237.14s]  Huh?
[9237.14s -> 9239.54s]  Does somebody just fight this like a person fighting here?
[9240.34s -> 9246.98s]  I don't know. I don't see it. What the fuck is this? Oh, yeah. I saw this guy earlier. I thought it was you
[9249.27s -> 9251.27s]  There's just a regular guy
[9251.35s -> 9253.35s]  Why is he naked?
[9253.43s -> 9257.14s]  Is this
[9257.14s -> 9265.19s]  Whoa?
[9265.19s -> 9271.28s]  Who is that?
[9271.28s -> 9273.52s]  Uh, anyways
[9273.52s -> 9277.28s]  Here's the thing about making a smoothie and don't fuck this up. It's so easy to put hold on
[9277.36s -> 9282.08s]  This is legendary put your hand in the blender. No, no, listen. Yes. Don't do that. That's
[9282.96s -> 9284.24s]  But listen to me
[9284.24s -> 9286.24s]  People I do this too all the time
[9287.44s -> 9290.02s]  And I got another remembrance
[9292.16s -> 9294.16s]  You're just fighting random guys
[9296.40s -> 9298.60s]  Okay
[9298.60s -> 9304.44s]  A lot of times when you have a blender you'll put way too much shit in it. You'll put a you
[9304.44s -> 9310.76s]  Oh, I guess it's a it's a it's a strawberry banana smoothie may as well put a three handfuls of strawberries in here
[9311.24s -> 9315.58s]  Don't do that. You don't actually need to use that much material
[9316.44s -> 9321.16s]  and easy on the liquid people just dump a shit load of liquid in there and they have like
[9322.28s -> 9327.01s]  Oh my god, and I did the crystal knight kill you
[9327.81s -> 9330.05s]  No, I was trying to get up this tower this tower
[9330.77s -> 9332.93s]  I I thought it would be easier with random enemies
[9333.49s -> 9335.49s]  It's not let me help this person
[9336.92s -> 9340.28s]  When you are making a smoothie if you want to thicken up a smoothie a little bit
[9340.84s -> 9342.84s]  The easiest way to do that
[9342.84s -> 9344.84s]  Is to just use a little bit of yogurt
[9345.24s -> 9349.48s]  Just get some plain or maybe vanilla just greek yogurt
[9350.52s -> 9353.24s]  If it's like, oh, this is a little too thin. I don't know just like
[9354.12s -> 9355.88s]  a little bitty greek yogurt
[9355.88s -> 9357.64s]  Bingo done
[9357.64s -> 9360.52s]  And then if it's too thick then you put a little water in no don't put water
[9360.92s -> 9364.04s]  You want to you're putting water put some more greek yogurt in
[9364.68s -> 9366.68s]  You don't know when you're not when don't use water
[9367.80s -> 9371.16s]  The base of your smoothie should be only a few things. Uh, excuse me
[9371.24s -> 9375.56s]  The base of the human fucking body is water. Why not water?
[9376.28s -> 9379.20s]  because
[9379.20s -> 9385.00s]  It's going to mess with the flavor profile and it's gonna be too thin. Oh the water is gonna have too much flavor
[9386.88s -> 9393.36s]  It's gonna throw everything off story. You can keep using water and keep making dog shit ass smoothies. That's fine with me
[9396.40s -> 9398.84s]  So and drink water
[9399.32s -> 9400.60s]  So
[9400.60s -> 9402.60s]  I'm gonna recommend you oat milk
[9402.92s -> 9404.92s]  I'm also gonna recommend you
[9407.11s -> 9408.47s]  It happened
[9408.47s -> 9413.35s]  It was in your chat and i'm doing it. This is the thing that you told me happens. You are the guy
[9413.91s -> 9418.23s]  Teaching me how to punch the thing that the story no, no, that's different
[9418.47s -> 9422.79s]  If you had walked up to that guy and said hey, uh, I just punched this thing and I don't get it
[9422.87s -> 9427.19s]  Can you you look like a big strong guy? Can you help me? That's not what happened. This person asked you
[9427.59s -> 9429.59s]  This person came up and asked you
[9430.60s -> 9435.32s]  You didn't walk up to that guy at this restaurant and you didn't walk up to this guy and say hey
[9435.32s -> 9440.20s]  I need some help. Could you explain to me what what your strategy is? Let's take two steps back
[9440.52s -> 9448.52s]  He asked what blender do you use and you're on about fucking what milk you haven't mentioned the blender
[9449.41s -> 9453.41s]  Because you told me that didn't you say this person like had a problem. They messed up
[9454.05s -> 9457.09s]  Asked what blender you use you added context to it though
[9458.58s -> 9463.54s]  You said oh he he screwed up his smoothie real bad. Can we hear what blender you're using?
[9465.28s -> 9467.80s]  I have a vitamix
[9467.80s -> 9468.84s]  There you go
[9468.84s -> 9474.15s]  Oh, that was easy. That was really easy. I should do that more often
[9474.71s -> 9476.55s]  Where are you? You're like
[9476.55s -> 9480.39s]  I went up the uh up top. Oh, I reset the enemies for you
[9481.80s -> 9486.37s]  There's a chest up here if you want
[9486.37s -> 9492.55s]  I've already been up there
[9492.55s -> 9494.55s]  Vitamix lul what?
[9497.86s -> 9503.17s]  And that's what happens when I read chat. I'm fine. Um, what's wrong with vitamix?
[9505.94s -> 9508.82s]  Yeah, I mean they're a little pricey. They are they are but it's like a
[9509.62s -> 9513.22s]  If you if you listen if you are making stuff in a blender all the time
[9514.29s -> 9516.29s]  It's crashed your game crashed
[9520.32s -> 9524.96s]  That's a common vitamix l what are you talking about? They're like they're
[9525.44s -> 9530.24s]  It's like an industry standard blender. Oh, I don't know. I use the ninja
[9532.72s -> 9534.88s]  Those are fine, too. That's wrong. There's nothing wrong with that
[9540.52s -> 9542.84s]  I have one. It's great. Yeah, if you can
[9543.32s -> 9545.64s]  If i'm if you're big big into
[9546.36s -> 9548.76s]  Putting stuff in a blender smoothies, you know like
[9549.56s -> 9554.52s]  Making like soups and shit making sauces and like pastes and garlic and
[9555.80s -> 9562.53s]  Making all kinds of cool shit, right? I don't do any of that. I I make smoothies only
[9566.92s -> 9569.88s]  Let me tell you ask if you do you you're like you're talking about it
[9569.88s -> 9572.36s]  Like you do it like you have experience and I was like man
[9573.40s -> 9576.04s]  I've been wanting to make like some homemade chili
[9576.60s -> 9584.69s]  For a while, but I also just don't want to do it. I have made I did my reinvite to you
[9585.01s -> 9593.27s]  I I that's kind of not true. I do I have made hummus a few times homemade hummus is actually fantastic. Although I
[9593.83s -> 9594.87s]  Last time I did it
[9594.87s -> 9598.32s]  I put like way too much garlic and way too much lemon juice in it
[9598.32s -> 9605.64s]  And I gave myself wicked bad heartburn for like three days three. Oh, it was bad. It was fucking awful
[9607.88s -> 9612.79s]  That's why you didn't stream those three days guys. You're like, where's jerma? That's right
[9613.88s -> 9619.16s]  Some wicked wicked sick amount of fucking garlic. You could do that in a food processor
[9619.16s -> 9627.11s]  Yeah, but you can also make milkshakes in this thing. You can also make smoothies and and it pulverizes shit a vitamix
[9628.98s -> 9633.72s]  Pulverize my game crashed
[9640.20s -> 9645.40s]  I got a I got a view of that what that looked like I saw that I did like a pog face
[9646.56s -> 9653.84s]  It snapped to like a what was that? Did you guys see that? You can just you can be let's be cheaters
[9654.16s -> 9659.56s]  What do you mean? Can't you just jump off the mountain and end up in radon's arena?
[9662.08s -> 9665.76s]  Maybe I don't know how to all right. I have a question for you. This is very serious
[9666.16s -> 9670.72s]  How do you know all these like wacky speedrun strats, but you didn't see like
[9671.38s -> 9679.16s]  Loretta why if you know the wacky speedrun strats, then you'd miss a lot of shit true
[9680.58s -> 9681.62s]  Yeah, that's what I mean
[9681.62s -> 9684.82s]  Like I remember loretta, but you would just like walk into the arena
[9685.30s -> 9688.18s]  And then there was like a setup to like hit her three times with a great sword
[9688.26s -> 9692.74s]  Then she would stagger then you'd kill her and then you'd just walk out of the arena like she's dead already
[9693.73s -> 9695.89s]  So when it was like, oh, there's a face. I had no idea
[9695.89s -> 9700.68s]  She had a face too and I probably actually killed her like four or five times. That's insane
[9710.66s -> 9715.65s]  But anyways it this shit gets pulverized. It's not just like a little ring ring ring
[9716.69s -> 9718.69s]  I'm telling you right now. I'm serious
[9718.69s -> 9725.09s]  Sometimes I feel like when I turn the blender on when I turn on my vitamix and it's like this thing's fucking powerful, dude
[9727.01s -> 9731.57s]  It's like when you're talking to an npc in a game and you accidentally selected the dialogue option
[9731.65s -> 9737.73s]  You've already heard I was like, oh tell me about the castle. Oh, yeah, we're don and loretta and then like, okay
[9737.81s -> 9740.45s]  Tell me about the mic. Oh fuck. I did the mixer one again
[9741.17s -> 9753.51s]  I'm gonna finish this last thought and then we're gonna stop wait. I seriously I feel sometimes sometimes
[9755.52s -> 9761.28s]  You can't skip this cut scene. I'm sorry. It's grayed out. It's like you're tapping start
[9762.16s -> 9765.60s]  This is important lore. This is a storyline cut scene
[9765.60s -> 9769.65s]  You can't skip this one when I turn my blender on and I turned up powerful
[9769.65s -> 9773.88s]  Sometimes I feel like my lights flicker because it's so powerful
[9774.68s -> 9777.80s]  Like sometimes it's like oh my here we go. This thing's got like a million
[9777.80s -> 9790.12s]  It's it thinks this thing's going and it's like wait a minute. What's happening. These things are powerful dudes bragging right now
[9791.92s -> 9797.28s]  Talking about like someone talk about their car what engine it's got. Oh my blender man. My blends are
[9800.29s -> 9807.25s]  Can you let's get this thing rocking who wants a smoothie? Oh you do you do here we go. All right
[9810.13s -> 9821.75s]  You fucking just blow out a whole neighborhood. Oh god, geez
[9825.35s -> 9828.68s]  You're too wild. I'm not really is we're just
[9829.48s -> 9836.00s]  This is not even a weird conversation. It's just we're just talking. This is a great script tonight
[9836.56s -> 9838.80s]  We're just talking
[9838.80s -> 9846.07s]  Super saiyan blender now. I love my vitamix. Don't you dare talk about it like it's bad
[9847.46s -> 9853.86s]  I don't even know i'm not invested in this. I just want you to join my game i'm coming
[9866.44s -> 9877.22s]  Nuclear powered blender to be fair. It hasn't done that in a long time
[9879.75s -> 9883.78s]  But that's still funny
[9883.78s -> 9889.06s]  Yes, I don't remember when this activates but we can't use it. I think we we have to go across the bridge
[9889.46s -> 9892.10s]  Or can you I remember they like shoot missiles at you?
[9892.66s -> 9896.66s]  Yeah, they shoot a lot. We I think we have to go sit at a bonfire in the plateau
[9900.71s -> 9905.51s]  There's also that tower nearby that has like 400 million items all around it
[9907.41s -> 9911.73s]  Has it done it before it probably hasn't even ever done it. I just like feel like it's happening
[9914.29s -> 9916.45s]  I don't know something. It's this thing is powerful
[9917.33s -> 9919.33s]  All right. All right, you know what just
[9920.45s -> 9924.21s]  So much it changes this perception of reality like my lights are flick
[9924.61s -> 9927.01s]  I don't know for real if they are but they could be
[9927.65s -> 9930.77s]  Because it's that powerful. No this thing I
[9931.41s -> 9935.89s]  This thing has like it's like a 10 speed. I don't think i've ever made it go past like six
[9936.63s -> 9942.55s]  I guess you're scared. You have no idea happen if I go to no, no this these things are legit. These are legit
[9945.44s -> 9947.44s]  His vision goes dark
[9950.16s -> 9954.32s]  They sell it and they say you're only gonna need to go to five we've never tested it at six
[9955.04s -> 9959.28s]  We definitely don't want to go to seven and ten will definitely fuck you up
[9959.28s -> 9961.28s]  It's like seven eight like
[9962.24s -> 9965.28s]  How it starts to shake like a coffee cup is on the counter
[9966.80s -> 9971.64s]  The coffee's kind of like t rexon. We don't know what could happen
[9972.28s -> 9977.97s]  Oh, didn't you want to come here?
[9977.97s -> 9988.21s]  No, but why not? Why not like at the bonnie? I think you can buy different things from here. Yeah
[9989.01s -> 9991.97s]  Like you can buy stuff from here, but it costs the dragon
[9992.53s -> 9998.50s]  Thingies really because I have a few of them. I got some decent stuff in here actually
[10001.33s -> 10003.33s]  Now I can drop spells
[10004.02s -> 10007.54s]  Let me ask you if any of these are doing it for you because I could just buy them
[10009.72s -> 10011.72s]  I have great heal
[10012.12s -> 10015.00s]  You have a dragon heart. I have three dragon hearts. Oh
[10016.20s -> 10020.32s]  Great great heal
[10020.32s -> 10026.13s]  Uh lord's divine. Do you need me to read what they do? No lord's divine fortification
[10027.89s -> 10035.19s]  Elden stars, which is 50 faith. It's the elden beast remembrance spell probably sucks
[10036.90s -> 10038.18s]  This is all faith
[10038.18s -> 10040.18s]  uh black flame
[10040.72s -> 10042.72s]  bestial constitution
[10043.22s -> 10045.78s]  Or bestial vitality
[10045.86s -> 10051.94s]  I could go for the heel because if I switch I would kind of like to be like a heel bot fireman faith caster
[10052.50s -> 10054.50s]  But i'm not sure i'm gonna great heal
[10054.90s -> 10056.85s]  Yeah
[10056.85s -> 10058.85s]  Okay, let me see if I can put it. Do you want anything else?
[10059.49s -> 10070.85s]  Am I gonna turn to a dragon maybe i've got the carrion knight sword in here, which I kind of want but I can't
[10071.73s -> 10073.73s]  Um drop the dragon heart
[10073.73s -> 10088.96s]  I cannot drop the drop the hearts. I drop the other spell I have to just in case you use it. Okay, let's uh continue
[10089.84s -> 10093.27s]  On our quest to how do we activate the dawn man?
[10093.83s -> 10096.45s]  I can't believe you got one guide
[10096.61s -> 10098.61s]  in somebody else's chat
[10099.33s -> 10102.44s]  It was an important topic
[10102.44s -> 10108.20s]  He can talk to you. He can take command of a conversation if it's something that he has great expertise in
[10109.00s -> 10111.00s]  And that just happened to be one of the things
[10111.88s -> 10117.48s]  I i'm not even an expert. I told you I don't even like I I use it to make a few very important things
[10119.84s -> 10137.94s]  Dragon
[10137.94s -> 10140.07s]  Oh my god
[10140.07s -> 10145.56s]  That's a lot of damage
[10145.56s -> 10150.20s]  That's the biggest spread. I kind of don't even want to fight him. I'm bored of him
[10151.08s -> 10153.32s]  I don't want to play with this anymore. Do you want to leave?
[10154.04s -> 10155.72s]  Yeah, okay
[10155.72s -> 10159.64s]  We're all we're just fighting dragons and salamanders back to back to back
[10162.23s -> 10163.19s]  so
[10163.19s -> 10166.23s]  If it randomizes every enemy and it randomizes everything, right?
[10167.19s -> 10169.19s]  Does that mean that?
[10170.55s -> 10175.67s]  Have we seen what can a duplicate happen? Have we seen a duplicate worm or their four worms don't happen
[10175.67s -> 10178.87s]  But there's a lot of worms and there's a lot of dragons. Yeah, that's true
[10179.83s -> 10184.72s]  So I don't think we'll see another worm then I think there's only four worms in the game
[10185.68s -> 10190.08s]  Weird we have we got them all how have we not seen an ulcerated spirit. There's like 10 of those
[10193.70s -> 10198.12s]  uh
[10198.12s -> 10199.91s]  We did
[10199.91s -> 10201.91s]  Didn't we I think we only saw one
[10204.68s -> 10209.56s]  Oh, we've only seen one of the jump trees as well. Do you want uh the wait, is this a
[10210.20s -> 10215.14s]  Is this a talisman?
[10215.14s -> 10221.80s]  You should probably take this if it is is it yeah, it sucks
[10224.28s -> 10228.45s]  Do you want this charm that raises focus? No
[10235.49s -> 10240.69s]  Why did I just buy this it was 100 more expensive. I just got lazy because I didn't feel like okay
[10252.50s -> 10254.50s]  Why are you killing this merchant?
[10255.33s -> 10257.33s]  Sell something I can use
[10258.42s -> 10266.42s]  You're no merchant
[10266.42s -> 10268.34s]  Let's go. Hey, that's fine
[10268.34s -> 10270.34s]  Let's go cops coming you can uh
[10271.30s -> 10273.94s]  You can do the dishonorable kills and d rank. I don't care
[10278.28s -> 10281.98s]  I've ever been in wow groups. Oh, we're gonna let's go to the crossroads
[10282.92s -> 10285.88s]  And it's like once once somebody started killing like the civilians
[10286.44s -> 10289.96s]  It's just like people just start spamming dropping group. It was like the biggest troll
[10290.52s -> 10293.16s]  with somebody because if you were part of a group
[10294.36s -> 10296.60s]  And you people started killing civilians
[10297.32s -> 10299.32s]  You would lose honor
[10299.80s -> 10304.28s]  So people would just be in groups like oh, yeah, we're gonna go to the crossroads. It's gonna be so much fun
[10304.36s -> 10306.36s]  Oh, don't do any dishonorable kills though
[10306.84s -> 10308.60s]  And then all of a sudden you'd see
[10308.60s -> 10313.72s]  Dishorrible kill disorder and somebody was just killing them and it was just like what the fuck dude like you just ruined everything
[10313.72s -> 10315.72s]  You just ruined like a week's worth of work for me
[10318.42s -> 10320.18s]  How does that ruin work for you?
[10320.18s -> 10325.16s]  Because it would d rank you because you had honorable kills honor and dishonor
[10326.34s -> 10329.22s]  reign of stars
[10329.30s -> 10334.29s]  bounding reign of stars
[10334.29s -> 10336.13s]  There are items on the top of the skull. That's right
[10336.13s -> 10340.13s]  There are let's uh, we're gonna go through the town and fight the uh the boss in here
[10340.29s -> 10343.25s]  Which is gonna be two bosses and it's gonna be fun. Yeah
[10344.05s -> 10347.01s]  Didn't know you were into wow pvp. I mean it wasn't really
[10347.89s -> 10349.89s]  But I mean it existed
[10355.33s -> 10357.33s]  Oh, we gotta do the thing to open the door
[10360.66s -> 10364.69s]  No magical crab
[10364.69s -> 10368.21s]  Ghost crab ghost crab magical puke or whatever. Their names are
[10371.56s -> 10398.04s]  the puke punk
[10398.04s -> 10400.04s]  But that was very weird
[10400.28s -> 10402.69s]  Okay
[10402.69s -> 10412.68s]  piece of shit
[10412.68s -> 10416.68s]  You're in so much. Oh, I I was I had a great view of that
[10417.49s -> 10420.13s]  If you had gotten hit by that on the ladder and fell down. Oh my god
[10420.29s -> 10428.20s]  You know how many louds there would have been air cannon down there. Watch out. I fell I pressed
[10428.84s -> 10434.52s]  Oh, I did press jump. Yeah, you're just watching me do that. There's like three towers to do and you're just watching me do one
[10435.40s -> 10439.19s]  You'll be all right
[10439.19s -> 10456.39s]  Yeah, i'll be all right
[10456.39s -> 10460.39s]  My second jump isn't working sometimes though. It really isn't I think we're lagging a little
[10461.03s -> 10463.03s]  And the inputs aren't being there
[10463.09s -> 10466.77s]  probably
[10466.77s -> 10470.95s]  No, I want to do it. You had plenty of time
[10476.28s -> 10478.28s]  Uh, that was it. I think I did the other one
[10478.76s -> 10484.84s]  Like yesterday really here. I'm gonna comment that that guy this guy I can lock onto it
[10485.56s -> 10490.45s]  I can't get on my horse and I can't lock onto it
[10509.99s -> 10512.55s]  Cool. Nice nice shot
[10513.84s -> 10517.28s]  All right. So from here we got a this chest down the street
[10518.08s -> 10522.44s]  Make sure you get the chest
[10523.09s -> 10524.31s]  Okay
[10524.31s -> 10530.18s]  browses
[10530.18s -> 10531.72s]  Academy scroll
[10531.72s -> 10533.72s]  He's almost 40 dot dot dot
[10535.96s -> 10538.05s]  Yeah, I know
[10538.05s -> 10539.92s]  I know
[10539.92s -> 10546.92s]  I know it's unfortunate how when you turn 40 they put you in a box and just push you out in the sea
[10548.31s -> 10554.71s]  I'm just floating out there. You just see like millions of other boxes just floating around individual boxes
[10555.51s -> 10557.51s]  I thought this was a bonfire
[10558.15s -> 10560.15s]  I guess um
[10560.61s -> 10562.61s]  We go downstairs. Why is this not open?
[10563.25s -> 10568.96s]  Because that one doesn't open yet. Uh, you gotta you gotta go down here and
[10569.68s -> 10572.50s]  I just thought that was a bonfire for some reason
[10579.52s -> 10581.52s]  Okay, elden beast
[10581.84s -> 10584.16s]  with his buddy
[10584.16s -> 10585.68s]  another dragon
[10585.68s -> 10591.52s]  If it's a magma worm, I I don't want to say anything. Okay. Oh, it's just one
[10592.56s -> 10594.02s]  uh
[10594.02s -> 10600.02s]  This is bad. But yeah, this might be this is gonna be awful. Look at how small this is. Well, he can't run away
[10600.50s -> 10604.98s]  Yeah, but he's he's gonna do the bubble burst explosive bursting move and it's gonna hit us
[10606.02s -> 10608.02s]  I don't i've never heard of that
[10608.58s -> 10610.58s]  Well, he's doing it right now
[10611.22s -> 10613.22s]  Yeah, this isn't real
[10613.38s -> 10633.84s]  I'm gonna hit him soon
[10633.84s -> 10635.20s]  Jesus
[10635.20s -> 10647.49s]  I don't know if that's helping or
[10648.08s -> 10653.52s]  His body is in such weird positions on the walls. It's so hard to find like a foot on the ground. Yeah
[10665.81s -> 10668.05s]  There it is
[10668.05s -> 10669.89s]  I'm gonna do it in three
[10669.89s -> 10670.77s]  two
[10670.77s -> 10675.81s]  Um not a little late. Yeah, he he moved that was he moved around weirdly and like went up the wall
[10676.85s -> 10697.64s]  God damn it. Oh god. This is it. He's doing this the thing I was talking about
[10700.90s -> 10704.50s]  I can't believe he didn't hit us. Let's just hope he doesn't do it again. I didn't even see anything
[10712.88s -> 10714.56s]  Oh, come on, man
[10714.56s -> 10720.16s]  Okay, I thought you'd jump over it. I guess not
[10726.40s -> 10728.40s]  Are you serious?
[10729.09s -> 10730.69s]  He's gonna kill me
[10730.69s -> 10732.69s]  What killed you? How did you die?
[10734.13s -> 10736.13s]  What did you die?
[10736.21s -> 10738.21s]  I also got grabbed by one
[10739.59s -> 10741.59s]  There were two what?
[10745.06s -> 10747.06s]  Okay, let me focus here never
[10747.38s -> 10752.61s]  What was that?
[10752.61s -> 10757.65s]  Nothing what happened grabbed both of us with the same I don't I don't know what happened
[10761.36s -> 10770.68s]  The other astle from snowfield was the ground ground was shaken. Maybe it was a desync
[10771.24s -> 10776.90s]  Maybe yeah, maybe you did get desync or something. No, they said the uh, the there's the other astle
[10777.60s -> 10784.92s]  Duplicates itself or something. Oh and they're just so close to each other maybe
[10786.82s -> 10790.74s]  You know because he like changed colors and like clones of him both went for me and you
[10794.34s -> 10797.54s]  Okay, well I didn't even have full flasks and you know
[10798.98s -> 10799.86s]  Yeah
[10799.86s -> 10804.26s]  I'm just saying that that like wasn't fair. I'm out the door
[10804.98s -> 10807.54s]  Proof that it wasn't an instant kill move
[10809.84s -> 10811.84s]  Yeah, but I mean
[10813.27s -> 10815.78s]  It is
[10815.78s -> 10818.66s]  Your health is your health was just really low. Yeah, but it is though
[10820.34s -> 10840.21s]  How's that not a leg? Oh it is it was weird
[10840.85s -> 10850.07s]  He's got to be close to stun
[10850.32s -> 10851.60s]  I think he is
[10851.60s -> 10861.40s]  Especially in the head
[10861.40s -> 10863.40s]  Really? I thought that was gonna do it
[10871.12s -> 10880.87s]  Okay, that was weird
[10880.87s -> 10884.55s]  Uh as janky as this is i'm liking this a lot more than the real astle fight
[10886.02s -> 10890.34s]  That yeah the fight sucks
[10890.34s -> 10894.18s]  The real astle fight and the elden beast fight are the same annoyance for me is like
[10894.18s -> 10897.54s]  Oh, it's a gigantic huge area and i'm just gonna literally disappear
[10898.84s -> 10902.23s]  And uh be across the whole game
[10902.23s -> 10907.48s]  You want to run at me again?
[10907.56s -> 10912.36s]  I still can't believe that that elden beast fight is not a horse fight. I feel like it was was supposed to be
[10913.32s -> 10931.59s]  What the fuck
[10931.59s -> 10938.36s]  I can't believe he's not stagger. This is crazy. I haven't hit him in a while but
[10947.04s -> 10951.36s]  Okay, see that time two went for me. It felt like they were that was weird
[10952.00s -> 10954.00s]  Oh, he caught you what it was
[10954.08s -> 10956.08s]  I there was like 15 hands
[10956.64s -> 10961.57s]  I like 10 hands came up to grab me
[10965.25s -> 10966.53s]  You got this
[10966.53s -> 10971.92s]  I drank one too many
[10971.92s -> 10984.44s]  You got it. I think he's fucking
[10987.91s -> 10989.83s]  Doing astle shit
[10996.16s -> 11020.32s]  Okay, no more healing
[11020.32s -> 11023.28s]  That was that was wacky. That was goofy. So was that
[11025.65s -> 11027.65s]  I hope he doesn't do another aoe attack
[11037.36s -> 11039.36s]  Seriously, like somebody's you're just gonna get grabbed
[11040.08s -> 11044.16s]  That move is when there's two of them doing it. This is no way. There's no way
[11044.88s -> 11048.00s]  I dodged something it felt like I felt like I avoided
[11048.64s -> 11052.48s]  Something it feels like they both do it but one of them is staggered a little bit
[11052.56s -> 11057.04s]  So it's like grab grab and it's just hands everywhere. I rolled into like the second one
[11057.04s -> 11061.67s]  I felt like it's like six to eight of them
[11063.33s -> 11068.53s]  Shit, can you block that with a shield if you just hold the shield up?
[11069.22s -> 11072.61s]  Can you just like oh or will he just grab you? There's no way
[11078.13s -> 11106.98s]  No, where did this yeti come from? I don't know. Okay
[11128.37s -> 11133.17s]  How do you how do you get away from you can jump those? Can you I thought I tried it last time
[11134.80s -> 11137.16s]  I think so, but you just have to like
[11137.16s -> 11140.16s]  Not get hit, you know
[11140.16s -> 11157.70s]  True god
[11157.70s -> 11160.98s]  Where the hell am I? What am I? Where am I? What's going on with me? Where is he?
[11161.30s -> 11164.90s]  Yeah, what's that was weird? What the fuck? He looked like he's picked you up
[11166.50s -> 11168.50s]  No, he's he's
[11168.90s -> 11170.90s]  In the corner. Oh, this is not good
[11175.65s -> 11178.45s]  We should probably just get out let him teleport. I'm walking away
[11180.69s -> 11182.85s]  This is the astle fight where you want to zone him
[11195.81s -> 11202.79s]  I thought something just broke through the ceiling. It was his fucking leg. What are the hell is stinger?
[11203.59s -> 11219.54s]  It really was a good second there. I was like, when did he get like magma attacks?
[11220.34s -> 11231.40s]  That meteor shit it shoots in front of them
[11231.40s -> 11236.28s]  That's why we're not gonna hit because it's like all target in front of them and we're like so like locked into these corners behind him
[11237.08s -> 11238.68s]  You cannot jump that
[11238.68s -> 11242.28s]  I think you just have to dodge through it. I wonder there's a trick to it
[11243.16s -> 11251.84s]  What's the you just have to run away from it. You can't dodge it at all. Okay
[11252.48s -> 11256.45s]  You definitely dodge it but like
[11256.69s -> 11258.69s]  It has to be one of the last ones
[11262.00s -> 11266.56s]  He's gonna turn into like seven guys in a second. He's gonna do some five guys shit
[11268.66s -> 11270.66s]  Would stop doing this move
[11270.90s -> 11281.48s]  Why does he keep?
[11281.48s -> 11283.48s]  Make sure you're full health. Whoa
[11284.52s -> 11290.60s]  Oh my god, there's a hundred of them. We thought there were two it's like 30. It's like 10
[11292.44s -> 11294.44s]  We didn't get him on the first sweep boys
[11298.77s -> 11300.77s]  What moves are happening?
[11304.88s -> 11316.21s]  Oh my god
[11316.21s -> 11317.09s]  Die
[11317.09s -> 11319.64s]  Okay, he's dead
[11319.64s -> 11321.24s]  Nice. Yeah
[11321.24s -> 11325.14s]  Oh my goodness
[11325.14s -> 11328.90s]  That he that was like seven people eight people no wonder
[11329.86s -> 11331.86s]  No wonder we were getting grabbed every time
[11334.63s -> 11340.07s]  Got some scrambled eggs. Maybe we own dragon hot. There are five worms. That's so bad
[11358.61s -> 11360.69s]  Oh, I need a lot more souls. I thought I did there we go
[11361.57s -> 11362.37s]  30
[11362.37s -> 11364.37s]  Uh 30 hp 30 bigger
[11365.25s -> 11367.25s]  And now stop leveling that
[11367.49s -> 11376.64s]  Cool. I got a pot wagons. Love me
[11378.87s -> 11381.51s]  You know the other dragon altar like way in the beginning
[11382.39s -> 11384.71s]  Mm-hmm. I feel like we should go there because
[11385.92s -> 11387.92s]  They seem to have really good items in it
[11388.08s -> 11390.66s]  We can do that
[11390.66s -> 11393.14s]  I thought this opened after you killed them. Is there something else?
[11394.76s -> 11396.92s]  I thought that was a seal. Maybe not
[11400.68s -> 11402.12s]  Maybe I missed
[11402.12s -> 11411.03s]  I don't know. Is it a seal chat? It's it there's a seal right? There's one more tower
[11411.51s -> 11438.31s]  Which one this one over here?
[11438.31s -> 11440.63s]  Yeah, i'm trying the same thing over on the other side
[11441.35s -> 11445.03s]  I just do I don't want to do it the right way. I want to do it like the dumb cheesy way
[11445.51s -> 11447.83s]  I forget where the right way is
[11452.90s -> 11453.62s]  Oh
[11453.62s -> 11461.08s]  Oh, I got it
[11461.08s -> 11489.43s]  All right. Which one do we need up here? There's the ladder. I believe in you. I'm just riding around. Yeah, there is this one here
[11495.12s -> 11498.32s]  I thought I did all of them
[11500.40s -> 11505.04s]  They can get I mean it's it's pretty same. It's pretty like samey out here
[11505.68s -> 11506.48s]  so
[11506.48s -> 11509.04s]  Uh, I mean like I was saying I did some of them yesterday
[11509.60s -> 11511.68s]  I like randomly was in the swamp and you weren't here
[11512.32s -> 11516.08s]  So, I don't know maybe it didn't save one of them, but I was pretty sure I did
[11516.64s -> 11520.00s]  One and we just did two and I think you only need three. I think it's three
[11520.56s -> 11545.94s]  Let's continue. I'm gonna rest for a second. Well, that was you
[11554.90s -> 11556.95s]  ball
[11556.95s -> 11559.19s]  That ball was very aggressive
[11559.99s -> 11564.85s]  And very angry
[11566.45s -> 11574.44s]  Gave them the ball call
[11574.44s -> 11576.36s]  Oh, it's blood
[11576.36s -> 11587.09s]  I'm just going up to the church
[11587.09s -> 11596.45s]  Mm-hmm somber stone miner's bell
[11598.26s -> 11607.57s]  Really? I feel like I that's probably the first two. It won't actually be somber stones. Oh really? That's right. Shit
[11610.56s -> 11619.24s]  What the fuck are you doing buddy?
[11619.24s -> 11621.24s]  We're gonna kill it. We're gonna kill that girl
[11623.12s -> 11624.16s]  No, okay
[11624.16s -> 11629.76s]  I thought we were kind of like just accidentally just fire. Just kill her. I know there's the cave straight up here
[11630.66s -> 11633.54s]  They're like hidden illusory wall. I know you're one
[11634.34s -> 11636.10s]  Yeah special
[11636.10s -> 11642.95s]  This one is this one sucks
[11643.25s -> 11646.71s]  Unendurable frenzy. I have a frenzy move. What the fuck is that?
[11647.35s -> 11649.35s]  Regal omen bairn
[11651.08s -> 11658.47s]  The hell is that I want to do a frenzy build if we wanted to do that
[11660.04s -> 11662.85s]  uh
[11662.85s -> 11665.67s]  What frenzy build it's where about it?
[11666.23s -> 11670.79s]  Yeah, I I tried it once with the vikes pike and all like the crazy like
[11671.59s -> 11681.43s]  With the eyes the spells is he pretending to know what i'm talking about. I know what you're talking about
[11682.92s -> 11690.39s]  Shabiri's whoa and shabiri. Yes. Yeah, you don't oh, I I know it. I don't um
[11691.11s -> 11703.32s]  Okay, so let me take a look at the map. I'll be really honest with you. You completely missed
[11703.80s -> 11705.80s]  I'm gonna be really honest with you. Mm-hmm
[11708.61s -> 11709.65s]  we've
[11709.65s -> 11713.41s]  Done a lot. I'm surprised. We've actually done this much on randomizer
[11715.52s -> 11730.34s]  Yeah, i've been once you get the gear and you just go to the places and kill the guys. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Uh-oh
[11731.27s -> 11737.89s]  Lag whoa. All right. My game does not want me to look over to the left for some reason. Yeah, my game is freaking out
[11738.53s -> 11741.44s]  Where'd my health go?
[11741.44s -> 11743.84s]  You only had half health when we came up here. I did
[11744.72s -> 11748.16s]  I think from the wolf, but you never like healed after that. Yeah
[11748.96s -> 11753.28s]  Oh, yeah, I i'm lagging so fast. Yeah, don't do not look that way
[11753.92s -> 11756.64s]  Something oh there's something that's spawned in over there. That's just not
[11757.36s -> 11760.66s]  The game does not like it
[11760.66s -> 11762.66s]  Yeah, so look at this
[11763.25s -> 11764.63s]  Look at this
[11764.63s -> 11772.02s]  I wonder what it is. What did the game spawn in there? That's making it so horrible. I don't know i'm going in the cave
[11773.20s -> 11776.40s]  I'm kind of uh, caving up. I'm kind of curious but whatever
[11778.08s -> 11780.56s]  I don't want to hunt down the thing that's gonna like make us crash
[11781.20s -> 11788.56s]  It's true
[11788.56s -> 11790.56s]  Even in the cave when I look in that direction
[11791.86s -> 11793.30s]  Oh shit. Yeah
[11793.30s -> 11802.74s]  Should we go kill whatever it is? Is it gonna cause a problem? I think that reset whatever it was. No, no
[11803.91s -> 11806.71s]  There is just this is the this is uh, this is our life
[11807.59s -> 11809.59s]  It might maybe it's down here
[11812.08s -> 11815.35s]  maybe oh
[11815.51s -> 11819.35s]  Yeah, maybe like in the boss room. There's like some giant thing that doesn't fit in it
[11819.99s -> 11821.99s]  It's like constantly trying to reset
[11823.56s -> 11825.56s]  Oh my goodness
[11825.80s -> 11830.82s]  Yeah, I don't know. I find that the 30 fps is a little bit more cinematic and you can't really see much better than that
[11830.82s -> 11839.51s]  Anyway, you remember when that was actually a debate I do
[11840.60s -> 11843.35s]  Well, here it is. I think is this it
[11850.26s -> 11853.22s]  Just take you through the fucking I went through the ceiling
[11857.38s -> 11859.30s]  I think it is this thing
[11859.30s -> 11861.94s]  This thing is not supposed to be down here. Oh god
[11864.72s -> 11867.40s]  Okay
[11867.40s -> 11869.88s]  when it despawns
[11869.88s -> 11874.44s]  That that was it. That was it. Yeah, that was it the fucking turkey down here was causing a huge problem
[11874.84s -> 11881.43s]  Okay. Well, we we cleared it
[11882.32s -> 11884.32s]  We cleared we cleared the fps boss
[11901.35s -> 11903.03s]  such crap
[11903.03s -> 11905.03s]  Look at look at this fucking garbage
[11906.64s -> 11908.07s]  junk
[11908.07s -> 11910.88s]  Another remembrance
[11910.88s -> 11912.96s]  No, just like all these crystals crap
[11914.85s -> 11920.37s]  Oh like this isn't real like this is a movie set. Is that what I don't I don't know. You don't like crystals
[11921.78s -> 11925.54s]  Making a stupid reference to back when I told you that the crystal spells are all terrible
[11926.50s -> 11930.18s]  Oh
[11930.18s -> 11936.77s]  Did you have a jo crystal?
[11936.77s -> 11939.89s]  Dude, you have a you have a turmeric bracelet. No, I don't
[11943.38s -> 11949.38s]  You mean oh you mean black tourmaline. It's not a turmeric. It's not a turmeric bracelet
[11950.02s -> 11953.70s]  And by the way, I don't have it on anymore. I it's not I
[11954.82s -> 11981.24s]  Do you need it for luck?
[11981.24s -> 11982.92s]  Wait turmeric wait
[11982.92s -> 11989.70s]  Turmeric actually is very good for you. Okay, but like in a bracelet. No, is it there it being goofy over here?
[11990.34s -> 12000.84s]  Okay, it's them starlight star bright shine the way through the dungeon tonight. You stopped wearing it because you got bullied
[12011.46s -> 12015.62s]  Uh-oh, is that a mog like?
[12016.58s -> 12021.62s]  That is not a mog like I I saw the cape and I couldn't really see what it was
[12022.34s -> 12026.37s]  Come on. You don't even know what a mog like is
[12027.17s -> 12040.10s]  No, this thing has the weird timings
[12042.20s -> 12048.20s]  They just do this over and over again
[12048.20s -> 12053.56s]  I'm pretty low on flasks already. So i'm hoping that this boss is not like a bird with his head stuck in the ceiling
[12054.12s -> 12060.28s]  I think we've gotten pretty
[12060.28s -> 12062.36s]  decent rolls on these
[12062.36s -> 12063.97s]  it's not like
[12063.97s -> 12065.97s]  Placidics whatever is in here
[12076.36s -> 12078.20s]  He's blowing the horn
[12078.20s -> 12081.80s]  Oh my goodness. This guy just fucking killed me
[12082.84s -> 12084.84s]  No, he didn't I thought he did
[12087.27s -> 12092.63s]  Help help. They're down here. Help someone you're like you're like a thousand feet below the earth, man
[12094.32s -> 12103.14s]  All right. You ready? What do we get? Yep. Okay
[12104.10s -> 12113.25s]  Not that bad. Oh, he's a new player. This is a new player
[12116.90s -> 12118.58s]  No
[12120.82s -> 12122.82s]  Oh and there's no fire on that one
[12138.44s -> 12144.52s]  Not that bad. We've been getting pretty good rolls in these
[12145.16s -> 12151.09s]  There's a lot of souls. I like souls
[12152.02s -> 12154.02s]  That was worth a lot of
[12154.10s -> 12157.17s]  blood echoes
[12157.17s -> 12165.30s]  Runes. Yeah, let's go farm blood vials. It's back. Yeah, it is. It's because that bird is back
[12166.55s -> 12171.83s]  We got to go kill that fucking bird and then come back. Let's teleport out of here. Honestly, let's go somewhere else
[12173.35s -> 12177.51s]  I want to fight radon dude. What do we have to do to fight radon? We have to go sit at a bonfire in
[12178.23s -> 12179.80s]  the plateau
[12179.80s -> 12181.80s]  Teleporting to the church down the hill
[12182.36s -> 12187.60s]  Because walking would be really hard. How do I say? How do I say? Yes, there they go
[12188.08s -> 12196.74s]  It's the best essential oil to cure bronchitis. I don't
[12198.79s -> 12207.40s]  I don't think I take whale oil for anything. What are you talking about? Whale is a great creature
[12209.64s -> 12211.64s]  That's one of the biggest creatures
[12215.54s -> 12224.85s]  Yeah antibiotics. Yeah, am I right? Yes
[12229.33s -> 12231.33s]  Think about it if you want to get big
[12233.51s -> 12237.54s]  Think about it. I'm a barf drinker did this
[12238.34s -> 12254.66s]  Trying to channel his energy right now
[12254.66s -> 12256.42s]  I'm exiting the area
[12256.42s -> 12258.42s]  Where where do you want to go from here?
[12258.82s -> 12262.29s]  I forget what's on the top though this hill
[12265.96s -> 12267.88s]  Need an inhaler
[12267.88s -> 12270.44s]  But bronchitis is I don't know
[12271.00s -> 12283.28s]  I'm not a fucking doctor. I don't know
[12283.28s -> 12285.04s]  Is there anything at all up here?
[12285.04s -> 12289.91s]  It was just a question
[12290.23s -> 12296.92s]  Let me tell you something about blenders first of all
[12297.86s -> 12300.68s]  Oh shit, we got a mog like
[12300.68s -> 12310.31s]  Yeah, I think you actually might be accurate. That's a mog like enemy, isn't it? Nope. It's a cool weapon though
[12310.79s -> 12320.92s]  Uh, this is actually gonna be hard. So just we gotta like I don't think they can come out
[12323.60s -> 12325.60s]  Ooh, that's good. Whatever that that's
[12326.63s -> 12328.63s]  I don't think i've ever seen this enemy
[12329.89s -> 12331.09s]  Yeah, you have
[12331.09s -> 12333.25s]  Down in the giant area when you go across the big chain
[12335.17s -> 12339.49s]  You mean where you just like ignore that whole area and run with your horse and just go up to the the giant
[12340.58s -> 12341.78s]  what
[12341.78s -> 12343.78s]  Did you stream a lot of your elder ring?
[12344.66s -> 12345.62s]  Yeah
[12345.62s -> 12347.86s]  What level were you when you got to like?
[12348.18s -> 12351.14s]  The giant area like what I wonder what level you were
[12353.48s -> 12371.59s]  Oh
[12371.59s -> 12375.59s]  You mean the place where you just get on your horse and just ride by everything. Yo
[12377.43s -> 12381.59s]  Item item item alert item alert item alert item alert item alert
[12382.39s -> 12383.75s]  somber five
[12383.75s -> 12385.75s]  Are you ready to go beyond?
[12386.15s -> 12390.18s]  Or do you not need that anymore? Give it to me
[12390.42s -> 12401.24s]  Do you have a six? I have a seven and an ancient
[12402.04s -> 12405.16s]  I have a four a seven and a nine
[12405.88s -> 12407.88s]  So that will help appreciate it. Thank you
[12418.23s -> 12420.79s]  Number go big big plus one level
[12421.51s -> 12425.75s]  Uh with somber, that's a big deal. That's ten percent. That is there's only ten levels
[12426.31s -> 12431.11s]  That's that is a full one out of ten, which is ten percent. Come on
[12431.83s -> 12437.83s]  It's gonna be more than ten percent. I have I have never been over here
[12439.30s -> 12441.22s]  I've never gone through there
[12441.22s -> 12445.70s]  I've never been up here. I've never been to this tower. Have I even played this game?
[12446.18s -> 12450.26s]  I'm starting to wonder maybe I didn't play this game. So when you
[12450.82s -> 12454.76s]  Did you play anything off stream too? Just kind of like in your own free time?
[12455.32s -> 12457.27s]  I think so. Yeah
[12457.27s -> 12458.63s]  You didn't do the thing where it's like oh
[12458.63s -> 12463.11s]  I want to see what this is and just go go over there in every single zone. Just kind of what's this
[12464.47s -> 12466.07s]  It's a big game
[12466.07s -> 12472.64s]  Yeah, but I you I feel like you missed you could just probably play this again and just see it. Sorry that you're mad
[12473.62s -> 12476.42s]  Yeah, we're very upset with you for not knowing where everything is
[12477.96s -> 12481.48s]  We're very upset. Okay. Well, wait, what is usually here because we came all the way up here
[12481.48s -> 12484.16s]  There's like nothing here. Just
[12484.48s -> 12490.08s]  Very upset with you that you didn't 100% and get every achievement. It's just it's like unfortunate that I even know you
[12490.64s -> 12494.23s]  How many hours do you have an elden ring?
[12495.86s -> 12498.34s]  On the game. Actually, I don't know. That's a good question
[12500.84s -> 12503.96s]  Probably not that much considering I did
[12505.64s -> 12507.64s]  I wanted to play it on my couch
[12508.72s -> 12511.28s]  So I got it on xbox
[12512.68s -> 12516.88s]  Okay, so you so you own like seven copies of the game get out of the way
[12517.91s -> 12528.48s]  There's an item on the ground. Can I pick it up? Thanks. I have a series s
[12532.87s -> 12535.27s]  Series s is uh, I love that little thing
[12538.05s -> 12541.57s]  Well, I think usually you gotta come up here because you gotta kill the guy who throws the pots down on the road
[12543.25s -> 12548.47s]  That's about it. I mean, you don't even gotta I want to fight radon
[12552.64s -> 12554.48s]  Jerma, take the wheel
[12554.48s -> 12557.28s]  Make it happen. Okay, we need to go to the plateau
[12560.60s -> 12564.68s]  So we're jumping off but we've got a series x I don't didn't really have a need for it
[12567.70s -> 12571.56s]  series x, um
[12571.56s -> 12573.72s]  It's I mean I I have a pc
[12574.20s -> 12577.80s]  So if I anything that comes out in the series x I would just get it here
[12578.44s -> 12584.55s]  I don't have a ps5. Do you have ps5?
[12585.78s -> 12591.25s]  Nope, do you have any of the current gen consoles or no you have a switch? Don't you?
[12591.57s -> 12598.29s]  I have a ps4 and they still release like every fighting game on that thing. I thought you had a switch though
[12598.29s -> 12604.37s]  Didn't you know I have a switch. Yeah, I've never used it. Is this sealed in the box?
[12604.93s -> 12607.56s]  No, uh, it's a wife device
[12607.56s -> 12608.68s]  Dude if it was sealed in the box
[12608.68s -> 12613.48s]  I would say keep it in the box and seal it because then you know that you got it like an heirloom plays like fire emblem
[12613.80s -> 12614.76s]  and
[12614.76s -> 12621.43s]  Zelda and all that breath of the wild is pretty fun. You never played it. I tried it on like a flight
[12621.51s -> 12625.91s]  I was like i'll take the switch like play it on the plane. Wait, wait, wait star star
[12626.87s -> 12632.98s]  Hold on be careful. I'm gonna stop you because you're about to have a lot of people
[12633.56s -> 12635.96s]  Very you're gonna get a you're gonna get a stir l here
[12636.04s -> 12641.08s]  I was saying earlier like me and you disagree on like everything you liked breath of the wild a lot
[12643.43s -> 12646.39s]  Okay, i'm just telling you just be careful with this next statement
[12646.95s -> 12653.46s]  It's gonna be a doozy guys. Be ready. Um, my opinion is that
[12655.54s -> 12660.98s]  Legend of zelda breath of the wild was ign's number one greatest game of all time
[12661.75s -> 12663.91s]  Is number one on their list. That's my opinion
[12664.93s -> 12672.53s]  You take all of the video games ever made and the best game of all time is on the switch and it's breath of the wild
[12676.10s -> 12677.38s]  Yeah, I disagree with that
[12677.38s -> 12682.24s]  I disagree with that good because that list was fucking ridiculous
[12682.32s -> 12686.48s]  Every blizzard game was all in like the same like it was like starcraft warcraft
[12686.56s -> 12688.48s]  Like they just like I don't put all the blizzard games here
[12692.74s -> 12699.16s]  I mean, I I don't I don't think that breath of wild is the best video game ever made. I think it's game crash
[12699.64s -> 12701.32s]  Oh
[12701.32s -> 12704.28s]  I want to fight. We're done. Yes, let's go up to the plateau
[12705.04s -> 12708.00s]  Um, I think I think it's really good. I think it's really fun
[12709.94s -> 12717.75s]  If you like elden ring, it's just kind of elden ring with cartoon graphics. I didn't give it enough time
[12718.39s -> 12720.55s]  and the breaking items
[12721.11s -> 12722.95s]  And stuff, I don't know
[12722.95s -> 12727.65s]  That rubs me the wrong way, but I definitely haven't given it enough time to even have any opinion
[12727.73s -> 12729.73s]  I legitimately got to the first dungeon
[12729.89s -> 12737.03s]  And then just didn't feel like playing the game I didn't like not like it
[12737.27s -> 12741.68s]  I think it's fun. I mean i've been streaming it not lately, but I think it's a good game
[12741.92s -> 12751.72s]  I have one major complaint about elden ring and it's it's kind of unfair because I bloodborne is like my number one
[12752.04s -> 12758.48s]  probably number two whatever favorite game ever made breath of the wild even on the switch sometimes runs it like
[12759.04s -> 12766.63s]  Like 18 frames a second. I opened the world to you. That's the only complaint I really have about it
[12776.85s -> 12779.41s]  You didn't your first time playing it was on stream, right?
[12779.65s -> 12785.54s]  I almost feel like I would I would need to be streaming it to play it
[12787.32s -> 12791.80s]  Like just sitting around to play breath of the wild was like, I don't know. I feel like it's so big
[12792.20s -> 12798.47s]  There's so much shit going on and I got to collect all these these peaches. I was like, I don't know
[12798.79s -> 12803.11s]  But it's a pretty good streaming because then I have to set up like a whole like twitch in my
[12803.75s -> 12809.25s]  The switch in my room and get like all the cables and that's just who's got time for that. Yeah
[12809.65s -> 12816.87s]  It is a pretty good stream game though. It's a chill game just to kind of just turn it on and play for a little while
[12818.72s -> 12824.40s]  Yeah, but they're like I would have to plug in like two cables. All right, so we are we're we do we should not be here
[12825.48s -> 12829.96s]  We need to go up to we need to go to the church though. We need to go to the plateau
[12830.28s -> 12836.69s]  I think once we get to the plateau, I think we have a cut scene. I'm I'm following you
[12837.63s -> 12839.01s]  100% okay
[12839.01s -> 12841.57s]  Let me uh, let me make sure I have this right
[12841.97s -> 12843.41s]  We have to get to the plateau
[12843.41s -> 12848.29s]  We get a cut scene when we go to the plateau and then it's like, okay, here we go radan's available, right?
[12848.45s -> 12856.28s]  That's correct. My chat says please just walk over the bridge
[12857.91s -> 12862.31s]  Those ballistas might not be manned because of the uh randomizer. That's also very true
[12865.99s -> 12867.27s]  Just go
[12867.27s -> 12869.11s]  Just go
[12869.11s -> 12872.15s]  No, that's part of that's part of ronnie's quest. Oh
[12873.03s -> 12883.33s]  Let's go to the bridges fucking walk. We have to talk to ronnie. We need a medallion for the bridge. Oh
[12886.72s -> 12891.36s]  Oh, yeah, and you like like normally I think the medallions in a spot where you just kind of like always get it
[12891.52s -> 12893.89s]  So I didn't really think about it much
[12893.97s -> 12897.56s]  But now we don't you get the two halves at the forts
[12898.84s -> 12906.64s]  Uh, let me level up first because I don't want if we just get bombarded with missiles. I don't want to get behind me soldier
[12910.12s -> 12913.72s]  Shit, we need to kill like one thing. Hold on. Let me kill like random thing over here
[12914.84s -> 12916.84s]  I can give you a rune
[12918.04s -> 12918.84s]  Yeah
[12918.84s -> 12927.80s]  Faster. I don't is that gonna do it?
[12928.52s -> 12933.09s]  Is that enough? I don't think that's enough
[12933.65s -> 12940.98s]  I can like give you another rune. You just keep arming me for runes. I need like another just give me I need like 800
[12944.10s -> 12945.78s]  You can get to the
[12945.78s -> 12952.44s]  You can either you activate the festival either by doing ronnie's quest line or activating any bonfire at
[12953.00s -> 12958.44s]  Atlas altis plateau. I think the fest the festival is active. It was just that we didn't have the medallion
[12959.32s -> 12965.59s]  to teleport
[12965.59s -> 12969.19s]  Uh, we let's try to do it this way and if we need ronnie's quest line. I have
[12969.99s -> 12972.47s]  I have I have two of the items for it. I think
[12973.03s -> 12975.03s]  Go over the bridge. Yeah, that's probably
[12975.89s -> 12984.93s]  I'm gonna blast
[12984.93s -> 12986.93s]  Okay
[12989.73s -> 12993.97s]  Yeah, there's just there's just like a pimple where the ballista would be
[12995.49s -> 12997.49s]  I I don't know why I didn't just try it
[12998.21s -> 13000.77s]  Yeah, we we kind of didn't trust this somehow
[13001.94s -> 13004.58s]  I don't know why we didn't trust that. This was gonna be easy
[13006.50s -> 13011.04s]  That was rough. Oh look a dragon
[13011.68s -> 13013.68s]  What the fuck
[13015.68s -> 13017.36s]  That was planned
[13017.36s -> 13021.76s]  They planned that oh my god the ambush. All right. Yeah, we just go don't even fight this
[13025.24s -> 13027.24s]  I'm glad you got a 3d movie, too
[13028.58s -> 13030.58s]  That had to have been right in your face, right?
[13030.58s -> 13033.94s]  Yeah, that was uh
[13033.94s -> 13035.94s]  I had the 3d glasses on and everything
[13046.36s -> 13049.19s]  You know, what's crazy?
[13049.19s -> 13055.59s]  3d like 3d glasses 3d movie 3d video game stuff really just fucking disintegrated, didn't it?
[13056.15s -> 13058.47s]  Dude, I was at uh, I was at the arcade the other day
[13058.47s -> 13061.35s]  I was telling you and they have a whole bunch of like vr stuff like oh
[13061.35s -> 13067.43s]  You can go in like the vr experience the omni room. Mm-hmm. And I was looking at it through the lens of like
[13068.31s -> 13070.47s]  This is this already feels outdated
[13072.72s -> 13076.16s]  This just feels like a weird gimmick like I know in like 10 or 20 years
[13076.16s -> 13079.84s]  that's gonna be like the same thing as the pac-man machine in the corner, but like
[13080.56s -> 13084.88s]  Even just seeing it like all brand new vr like like we have a vibe headset
[13085.84s -> 13087.81s]  Yeah
[13087.81s -> 13089.17s]  I think
[13089.17s -> 13093.01s]  Doctor, I was last you've been to an arc. You went to an arcade recently when you did that thing, right?
[13094.40s -> 13099.36s]  Yeah, like two days ago. Yeah, like on the weekend. I gotta get you a take on this. Did you need a smithing stone four?
[13100.32s -> 13102.96s]  What a smithing stone four I just gone and you need that
[13103.60s -> 13108.08s]  I don't know. I need like an eight or something. Have you noticed that?
[13108.88s -> 13111.04s]  all the light gun games at the arcades
[13111.84s -> 13116.40s]  Have stayed in like 2003 like their graphics are terrible
[13117.04s -> 13119.76s]  Yeah, frame rates are always dog shit the mechanic. Oh
[13120.32s -> 13122.32s]  Also, this is let me add
[13122.32s -> 13128.00s]  They have uh, they had like a whole booth where like eight people could go in and play vr and they've got like slippery feet floors
[13128.08s -> 13131.92s]  You actually like run in the games and it's got like foot trackers. Oh, which was also
[13132.40s -> 13135.04s]  There's a little miserable
[13135.04s -> 13140.48s]  That wasn't good. Also, you're just wearing vibe headsets, but they can't license out vibe games
[13140.48s -> 13142.48s]  That I guess they thought it would be cheaper to make their own games
[13142.56s -> 13146.21s]  So it's like that you could play beat saber
[13146.21s -> 13152.69s]  But it was like song master and it was they're all just like super shitty copies of all the games you would want to play
[13153.09s -> 13157.12s]  Oh song master
[13162.66s -> 13167.78s]  I got that's like a great online handle name like the song master
[13169.99s -> 13177.67s]  What is controlling this globe that's an enemy they they're in the mystic river or whatever. Oh they are
[13181.49s -> 13183.65s]  the song master
[13183.65s -> 13189.51s]  Yeah, we played elite force which was the generic military death match
[13191.62s -> 13194.42s]  It took longer to like get us all strapped in than it did to play
[13205.94s -> 13207.06s]  yeah, I
[13207.06s -> 13212.82s]  I'm trying to think of what was it when vr came out is when 3d glasses weren't cool anymore, right?
[13213.30s -> 13218.37s]  I think they weren't cool for a while anymore. And also they call them 4d glasses now
[13219.91s -> 13224.63s]  I remember and this is as I remember going to see I believe it was
[13225.03s -> 13227.19s]  I think it was avatar in theaters
[13228.23s -> 13233.59s]  The avatar like the first one and it was a big deal because it was 3d and you get the 3d glasses
[13234.23s -> 13234.95s]  You're you're right
[13234.95s -> 13239.27s]  So someone I know was saying that they went to go see the new avatar and they're handing out 4d glasses
[13239.35s -> 13243.03s]  Like they rebrand it 3d because it's like oh 3d is kind of lame now
[13243.03s -> 13247.03s]  So we're gonna give them 4d glasses and we were like that doesn't make any freaking sense
[13247.19s -> 13252.95s]  They're like no the fourth dimension is time and avatar takes time to watch. It's a 40. It's like they're not like it's sure
[13253.11s -> 13257.11s]  This room is fucked by the way. I don't think we should even go in here. Look at all this
[13258.15s -> 13260.15s]  They can't even move in here
[13261.11s -> 13262.72s]  um
[13262.72s -> 13265.84s]  The only reason why I bring it up is because I remember it because it's a long movie
[13266.48s -> 13272.32s]  I think halfway through the movie. I just I took the glasses off because I was like I can't fucking stand this anymore
[13272.64s -> 13274.80s]  I like my head hurt. I kind of felt like ill
[13275.52s -> 13277.04s]  And I watched they're rough
[13277.04s -> 13282.80s]  I watched like 20 to 30 minutes of it just all fucked up looking and blurry and spaced out weird
[13283.54s -> 13288.26s]  I got up and I went just got like snacks and shit. I think I walked around the lobby for like 10 minutes
[13288.98s -> 13291.94s]  I missed like a portion of the whole middle part of the movie
[13292.90s -> 13298.26s]  And then I kind of went to the bathroom. It had to been at least 10 to 15 minutes that I was not in the seat
[13299.43s -> 13302.07s]  And then I just put the glasses back on
[13302.71s -> 13304.87s]  And off hold on. I don't want to die
[13306.40s -> 13311.44s]  I I in intervals would take the glasses on and off and watched it blurry and then watch it in 3d
[13312.84s -> 13315.32s]  For the rest of like the hour and a half that I was still there
[13323.52s -> 13328.15s]  Do you think I'll I just I only ever used them like one time and I do kind of remember
[13328.23s -> 13330.23s]  It's just like my head and eyes kind of hurt
[13331.33s -> 13336.21s]  Do you think there'll ever be a period where they'll do vr movies with vr headsets in the seats?
[13338.44s -> 13341.80s]  And there'd be something to watch or something to like participate in
[13342.28s -> 13345.46s]  I feel like that's the next step and that's very possible
[13345.46s -> 13351.14s]  I feel like that's some some shit you'd find in like a museum or a zoo like you go into the zoo experience
[13351.62s -> 13356.26s]  And like oh you can like pet the penguins and they're like like, you know vr zoo experience in the zoo
[13356.42s -> 13358.02s]  I'm telling you that's the real thing
[13358.02s -> 13361.86s]  I know it I I feel like i've heard of that before from somewhere avatar 6
[13361.86s -> 13364.34s]  You're going to be able to walk around the movie set while the movie happens
[13364.42s -> 13367.97s]  I'm just telling you that's what's happening
[13367.97s -> 13372.77s]  There's going to be the movie playing and you're going to be able to just be kind of walking around or just looking at stuff
[13373.01s -> 13376.96s]  And this is going to be the movie over here. That actually sounds kind of cool
[13381.89s -> 13385.17s]  Hopefully in that future you go to the theater you sit down
[13385.96s -> 13391.66s]  And then like an anesthesiologist comes over and injects lsd into your fucking jugular
[13392.85s -> 13395.17s]  And instead of watching a movie you all just trip together
[13396.13s -> 13399.81s]  What's the point of being what's the point of the movie and then on the movie screen?
[13401.01s -> 13403.01s]  The hypno toad from futurama
[13403.57s -> 13404.93s]  so you say
[13404.93s -> 13406.29s]  what's the
[13406.29s -> 13410.05s]  I don't know how to respond to this
[13410.37s -> 13412.37s]  Instead of everybody in a chair
[13412.69s -> 13414.69s]  It's like because it's just an experience
[13415.59s -> 13418.63s]  That would be a terrible experience because you oh, yeah all like
[13419.43s -> 13424.07s]  You want a room full of like 50 to 100 people all doing lsd. How many of them are standing up?
[13424.87s -> 13427.99s]  And like walking around the aisles and shit like I don't want to do i'm not in that
[13427.99s -> 13433.11s]  I don't I don't want to be in that fucking movie theater. You're oh you get strapped in what?
[13433.67s -> 13435.67s]  Get strapped into the chair
[13435.91s -> 13437.91s]  I'm not going to this movie
[13441.43s -> 13444.55s]  Nope they're a professional. Nope. Nope
[13446.87s -> 13448.98s]  Uh-uh
[13448.98s -> 13452.02s]  I like my vr you walk around like the set that
[13452.66s -> 13457.40s]  james cameron made
[13457.40s -> 13463.35s]  It's torture. That's weird
[13463.35s -> 13466.71s]  But shoot would you be able to be heard and seen by other people?
[13467.51s -> 13473.52s]  I think imagine like a big vr chat lobby just like all yelling shit and screaming at each other
[13473.52s -> 13476.96s]  Well, there's two actors just talking and the movie's going on
[13478.08s -> 13489.32s]  But that would be hell proof earmuffs on you stir. You're describing a clockwork orange
[13491.09s -> 13493.41s]  Oh my god, it's a good movie
[13494.21s -> 13498.60s]  Holy shit. Oh my god
[13499.16s -> 13504.60s]  All right. So we're kind of we're doing the minecraft build the wall take the wall down build the wall
[13505.00s -> 13509.56s]  Take the wall down build the wall. What do you mean? We haven't made any progress. We need to let's go
[13509.96s -> 13514.20s]  We're killing a lot of things. I got a lot of loot. Uh, we go we're going this way, right?
[13514.76s -> 13517.08s]  This is it's this way. We just go up here the stairs
[13517.97s -> 13519.56s]  And that's where it is
[13519.56s -> 13524.92s]  It's in like a hallway. No, i'm telling you right now to your face where it is. We gotta go this way
[13525.56s -> 13528.36s]  Where are you going? Where are you? There's an item up here that you
[13529.08s -> 13532.58s]  Didn't get I did I did though
[13536.00s -> 13537.84s]  And there's the mega slime
[13537.84s -> 13539.84s]  Watch out for the mega slime. Oh
[13545.86s -> 13547.22s]  I don't have any mana
[13547.22s -> 13559.36s]  That's sad
[13559.36s -> 13563.76s]  If they ever did that let's say there was like avatar 6 was like you everyone could put the vr headset on and kind of walk
[13563.84s -> 13566.80s]  Around while the movie was playing out in like a 3d space around everybody
[13567.83s -> 13570.87s]  They definitely would just make it so you couldn't you had to have like the avatar
[13571.67s -> 13573.99s]  Everyone had to would have to probably have to be an avatar, right?
[13574.23s -> 13575.51s]  You'd have to be oh
[13575.51s -> 13579.03s]  So you would get the you would get the point of view of the protagonist
[13579.11s -> 13583.75s]  No, no, no, no would be like a side npc and we would all have different points of view and then like when the characters are
[13583.75s -> 13590.24s]  Talking it's like i'm talking to you, but you're like jack naley or whatever his name was and then like we kiss
[13590.72s -> 13592.72s]  No
[13592.80s -> 13594.80s]  I'm talking about watch out
[13595.64s -> 13596.84s]  bad guy
[13596.92s -> 13604.10s]  I need to what I got scarlet rodditt i'm talking about the movie is just
[13604.74s -> 13609.86s]  In 3d space the movie is being is playing and you are just in that space
[13610.50s -> 13614.50s]  You you cannot interact you just can be in the space and see like the crazy shit
[13615.70s -> 13617.46s]  You can walk around in it
[13617.46s -> 13621.78s]  If somebody's talking this looks like let's say you got let's say you get tom hanks over here and he's talking to
[13622.50s -> 13624.50s]  Um, who else is an avatar?
[13624.50s -> 13630.74s]  Uh, whatever so you got tom hanks is an avatar probably so this you got tom hanks and there's another person talking
[13631.38s -> 13632.18s]  and
[13632.18s -> 13636.42s]  You can just literally leave the room and just go look around like the world of avatar
[13637.67s -> 13643.04s]  And you don't you can just do whatever you want. Oh, so you're saying like the movie scene is happening in this room
[13643.36s -> 13645.92s]  But you can just leave the room and look at like an empty field
[13646.00s -> 13649.04s]  While like the the cinematic is going on and you're like not even present
[13649.20s -> 13652.80s]  Can you imagine how different that movie would be from multiple different crazy places?
[13652.80s -> 13655.60s]  You can watch from if there was a big battle imagine just being like no
[13655.68s -> 13659.52s]  I'm just gonna go on like the roof of this random building and just watch the battle from there this time
[13660.40s -> 13662.64s]  Oh, I yeah, I can imagine being in the movie
[13663.84s -> 13668.32s]  Of a big battle an immersive experience of you in like the traumatic war movie
[13669.20s -> 13675.04s]  Like the avatars are all getting bombed or something. Oh, no my like urn tree's burning whatever their shit is
[13675.84s -> 13681.28s]  Yeah, that sounds like that sounds way better than my idea of like putting people on lsd and strapping them in
[13684.53s -> 13686.53s]  Hold on out of the spot
[13687.44s -> 13692.29s]  I'm in trouble here
[13692.29s -> 13695.65s]  I like stirr's plan. No, you don't stop
[13697.36s -> 13700.40s]  That's weird because my plan was not spoken to be liked
[13701.60s -> 13704.64s]  That's weird that you like yeah. Oh man, that sounds pretty good
[13705.12s -> 13709.12s]  You mean I got to take lsd and sit and like freak out at a movie theater
[13710.00s -> 13712.74s]  Sign me up
[13712.74s -> 13713.94s]  Well, it feels like okay
[13713.94s -> 13714.26s]  Okay
[13714.26s -> 13720.02s]  It feels a little bit the same where like vr is kind of like the new experimental technology like we're just starting to dabble in vr
[13720.34s -> 13722.98s]  Like why not like also like hard drugs?
[13725.40s -> 13729.08s]  but like hard drugs start, you know, they're starting to get like more accepted like uh
[13730.04s -> 13733.96s]  Psychedelics, you know, they're starting to be like, yeah, maybe we should like do some psychedelic research
[13734.44s -> 13739.08s]  You know, they're not like they're not the worst. But wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you in they start doing public?
[13739.16s -> 13742.60s]  Uh, like the public can start getting to the macros to these and we're gonna do like psycho
[13743.80s -> 13744.12s]  All right
[13744.12s -> 13751.56s]  Are you implying are you implying that movies are potentially going to get are getting more boring or kind of lame to a point?
[13751.56s -> 13753.56s]  We're like that's what i'm saying
[13754.28s -> 13760.92s]  You just okay. So let's take movies out of the equation. You're just saying that do drugs in a big group. That's your idea
[13761.32s -> 13763.64s]  That's the idea. That's your idea
[13764.12s -> 13766.12s]  That's just it
[13767.96s -> 13769.96s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[13770.20s -> 13771.96s]  All right
[13771.96s -> 13773.96s]  To be clear. I think you got it
[13775.16s -> 13779.16s]  So movies have nothing to do with movies have nothing to do with our conversation at all
[13779.72s -> 13784.44s]  From your from your side here movie theaters, we're just talking about like entertainment that started with like vr
[13784.68s -> 13789.16s]  Okay, the same way that like vr has the goofy like sign up for the vr booth and it's like weird
[13789.80s -> 13794.04s]  Yeah, you'll give it a couple years. It's gonna be like sign up this so we're doing lsd at noon
[13795.40s -> 13798.10s]  I don't think so. I think so
[13800.05s -> 13802.23s]  And you know what?
[13802.55s -> 13804.55s]  That's fine. It's funny. So
[13804.95s -> 13810.63s]  Vr is a thing now my idea is vr kind of evolves a little and we participate in movies
[13811.11s -> 13816.31s]  Your idea is vr fails. Okay, we all do drugs in a room strapped to chairs
[13816.87s -> 13818.87s]  Follow where's the logic?
[13819.43s -> 13823.92s]  I got the logic for you right now. It's it's loaded up. Are you ready? I'm ready
[13824.40s -> 13831.36s]  I'm a billionaire the fight earth is boring. I'm going to buy a rocket ship company and fly to space
[13832.32s -> 13833.52s]  That's happening, right?
[13833.52s -> 13838.16s]  But you also have like a lower level of rich persons like I can't buy my own rocket to space
[13838.48s -> 13842.96s]  I'm gonna go to brazil and find someone to administer ayahuasca to me in the middle of the jungle
[13844.02s -> 13851.14s]  What if we monetize ayahuasca from the jungle and just brought it into the fucking psychotorium and did it like a movie theater?
[13853.81s -> 13855.81s]  I don't even know what I don't know what he's saying
[13856.61s -> 13859.33s]  What he's saying invest invest
[13859.33s -> 13861.33s]  Invest
[13861.33s -> 13863.33s]  Psychotorium coming to your city
[13863.97s -> 13865.25s]  dude
[13865.25s -> 13867.81s]  You're psychotorium me out right now
[13869.28s -> 13878.18s]  Where's the bond? Oh, there's a bonfire
[13878.18s -> 13880.02s]  all right, let's
[13880.02s -> 13884.34s]  You haven't heard of any of these like random rich people going to the jungle to like do like a
[13884.98s -> 13886.98s]  ayahuasca experience
[13887.06s -> 13891.06s]  I mean I hear about you know, oh, we're gonna we're gonna do. Yeah. Yeah, of course I have
[13892.02s -> 13894.02s]  Yes, of course
[13894.18s -> 13896.18s]  Of course I have I feel like there's a lot more
[13896.26s -> 13898.26s]  Of course a lot left unsaid
[13899.14s -> 13902.36s]  I've been to brazil
[13902.36s -> 13904.04s]  Dude, let him cook
[13904.04s -> 13905.72s]  No, don't let him cook
[13905.72s -> 13908.66s]  If he cooks it, no
[13909.06s -> 13912.50s]  All right. You ready to start this?
[13912.50s -> 13915.35s]  Yeah, I love a good festival
[13916.07s -> 13918.07s]  Let's all strap in. Yeah
[13919.59s -> 13925.40s]  I love a good. Oh, no, he's in a cheese in the chair right now. Oh, oh shit
[13925.56s -> 13930.20s]  I'm going to the vr room. I want nothing to do with this. The vr room is lame, dude
[13933.41s -> 13935.97s]  It's just so funny to me the very we're talking about movies and
[13937.41s -> 13944.69s]  My thing that i'm saying is you taking away the visual just remove the theater part and it's just everyone do drugs together
[13944.77s -> 13949.67s]  There's no theater said that the theater is displaying the futurama
[13950.19s -> 13952.99s]  hypnotote
[13953.01s -> 13957.65s]  Don't you think that would just freak everybody out like who you know what that if it's like, oh everybody
[13957.65s -> 13960.77s]  Let's all just stare at this on lsd for four hours
[13960.93s -> 13963.33s]  Okay, well then we can pull it back and it can just be like
[13963.89s -> 13967.01s]  I don't know a room like a singular room around here
[13967.73s -> 13971.09s]  I don't I don't know if there's like a texas thing. There are so many weird build
[13971.17s -> 13972.37s]  I don't know what they do
[13972.37s -> 13979.57s]  But it's like come in here for your like your health clinic like personal like carbon digital health digital health clinic
[13980.31s -> 13984.87s]  And they're like really pristine places that have like nothing in them. If you just look in the class
[13984.95s -> 13989.14s]  It's just like a table with one person at it. I don't know what they're doing in there
[13990.40s -> 13993.67s]  I don't know what they're doing in there
[13994.31s -> 13996.55s]  like like expensive area like
[13998.34s -> 14004.40s]  There's never anyone goes in no one ever comes out. I've never heard of this
[14005.20s -> 14011.70s]  I don't know. I've I've never heard of this digital health. There's also like a cryogenics place like around here
[14011.86s -> 14015.46s]  Is it are you sure they're not sure it's not like a hospital? No
[14017.97s -> 14022.58s]  All right, I don't know car cartel money laundry. There's a place near here
[14022.66s -> 14031.46s]  I I honestly think a legitimate large amount of places here have to be invested in like money laundering. There is a drive through
[14032.26s -> 14040.72s]  Jewelry store. This place has a fucking open drive through who is driving through it's like a like a

[14287.06s -> 14289.06s]  All right, let's go. Where were you yesterday?
[14295.27s -> 14300.05s]  All right, so here's the deal. We are gonna go to the where do we how do we get here?
[14300.21s -> 14307.35s]  I don't know how to get out of here. What do you mean? You don't know how to get out of here
[14307.43s -> 14311.51s]  We need we need the medallions but there's that we can go through wait. No, no, no, no, no
[14312.07s -> 14317.12s]  We can go we can go here. Yeah, right. No, no, no right below that the road
[14317.20s -> 14321.36s]  I have the medallion for that lift what you do. I thought you yeah. Oh, all right
[14321.44s -> 14324.95s]  Yeah, let's go. You just follow the road follow the road. So we uh
[14326.15s -> 14330.31s]  Main academy gate or can you do no because the bridge is broken. The bridge is broken
[14330.39s -> 14332.47s]  So we need to go all the way up the right or you need to
[14336.04s -> 14339.91s]  Um, I think we actually do have to go up this way
[14341.00s -> 14348.36s]  Yeah, I think we have to do the whole right path because everything there is a cliff. The bridge is not broken
[14348.36s -> 14350.95s]  I think we can just go over
[14350.95s -> 14372.28s]  Uh, okay. The bridge is not broken. There's a teleporter on the bridge. Cool. Yeah a movie-length car wash in vr
[14372.28s -> 14380.53s]  Is the future movie-length car wait you go to the car wash and you put it you put a vr headset on
[14380.61s -> 14386.21s]  I feel like entertain you while you're going through the car wash and like while you're going through they're like taking the tires off the car
[14388.05s -> 14391.49s]  You're getting robbed if you do that, by the way, yeah, it's like yeah
[14393.57s -> 14395.57s]  Come to the car cleaner
[14395.57s -> 14396.77s]  Come on in
[14396.77s -> 14399.09s]  You just like sitting there all your shit's gone
[14399.89s -> 14403.73s]  What I was gonna say is all the paint is gonna get stripped off your car
[14403.73s -> 14407.81s]  You guys are gonna be fucked up after that. It's gonna be dense everywhere. All the paint's gonna be gone
[14408.47s -> 14410.47s]  Holy shit, man
[14410.47s -> 14414.79s]  Like a three-hour movie of just your car being washed your car is gonna be fucked up
[14415.03s -> 14426.08s]  Oh, we have the key so we can do this. The stream has gone completely unhinged. Yeah, it has
[14427.09s -> 14431.73s]  Well, don't worry. We'll get back on the road. We will it's inevitable. We always do we always get back on the road
[14443.75s -> 14447.38s]  Yeah, we're getting we're back on the road. We took a wrong exit
[14448.02s -> 14451.94s]  We're calm relaxed. We're done talking about anything
[14452.98s -> 14454.18s]  At all
[14454.18s -> 14460.23s]  It's all been banned
[14460.23s -> 14471.65s]  Do you get an item for this and we just have to go across here and we will activate it night cavalry
[14473.04s -> 14475.04s]  Let's actually we probably this pretty easily now
[14477.64s -> 14482.26s]  Yeah, they're like not replaced. That's kind of weird that they're not random. That is weird
[14487.68s -> 14492.64s]  All right. I thought I was you for a second inside of that. I mean it is horse combat
[14501.00s -> 14502.92s]  Oh, it does a lot
[14502.92s -> 14509.88s]  I can't there's so much there's so much
[14510.68s -> 14521.78s]  Fire light on the screen. I can't see anything horses up. We've been killing the horse the whole time
[14523.46s -> 14534.98s]  fine once he falls we just gotta we gotta
[14535.78s -> 14538.66s]  Really rip into him rip and tear he's about to fall off
[14539.38s -> 14542.05s]  Or run away
[14542.05s -> 14544.05s]  One of the two all right. He's off
[14559.12s -> 14571.32s]  eat
[14571.32s -> 14576.12s]  The lock on yeah the lock that lock on bug is annoying. I couldn't lock on to him and it got weird
[14580.34s -> 14582.66s]  Yeah, it keeps like dumping it. I keep this like
[14598.21s -> 14602.61s]  There we go
[14602.61s -> 14605.72s]  and
[14605.72s -> 14608.28s]  Oh somber smithing stone, too
[14611.09s -> 14614.93s]  How come stir streams at 1080p 60 fps and you don't because stir
[14616.56s -> 14619.06s]  doesn't understand
[14619.06s -> 14621.22s]  the quality versus bit rate
[14621.94s -> 14623.06s]  thing
[14623.06s -> 14624.26s]  What?
[14624.26s -> 14626.07s]  What do you stream at?
[14626.07s -> 14627.99s]  864
[14627.99s -> 14629.99s]  You stream it like one of the weird numbers, right? Yeah
[14630.95s -> 14634.87s]  Yeah, I did that for a bit and then like my settings reset and I forgot what number I was doing
[14634.87s -> 14636.87s]  So I just went back to like default
[14637.59s -> 14638.63s]  I know
[14638.63s -> 14643.51s]  Stop thinking but yeah, I understand that what germa is doing is correct and you're just trying to find
[14645.16s -> 14647.40s]  Things that aren't correct, but this one is correct
[14649.06s -> 14652.88s]  There you go
[14652.88s -> 14658.31s]  case closed
[14658.31s -> 14659.43s]  uh these
[14659.43s -> 14661.43s]  Work. Oh, no the crab is
[14662.07s -> 14664.07s]  Trying to work them. I think
[14665.30s -> 14668.90s]  Crabtable, uh, the crab is about is is being catapulted. He might act
[14669.80s -> 14677.00s]  Yeah, you want to take a look at this. I don't see a crab. I think he's gone
[14677.96s -> 14681.62s]  Yeah, he's he didn't make it. He didn't make it
[14692.72s -> 14696.48s]  Oh, uh, I just got urgent heal. Do you want that?
[14699.01s -> 14703.43s]  Uh, just hold on to it until I switch if I do
[14705.88s -> 14707.38s]  uh
[14707.38s -> 14709.62s]  Just stream at the best settings. Well if
[14710.34s -> 14712.34s]  the thing about streaming
[14712.34s -> 14714.34s]  Is if you go over
[14714.58s -> 14716.82s]  If you go over 6 000 bit rate
[14717.99s -> 14719.99s]  Then I believe
[14719.99s -> 14722.63s]  You are considered to be that's not allowed
[14723.19s -> 14728.23s]  I think that there are some cases maybe where I don't know maybe they allow some maybe events to do it
[14728.31s -> 14733.91s]  I don't know. I have heard of an individual streamer who was like granted the privilege to get like 10k bit rate
[14735.22s -> 14737.22s]  I like a very
[14737.80s -> 14738.92s]  rare
[14738.92s -> 14745.16s]  Thing everything i've ever heard or been told is that anything over 6 000 is considered like against terms of service
[14746.12s -> 14750.20s]  Okay, well I have also heard that but I also used to stream at 8k for quite a while
[14750.44s -> 14753.19s]  I have no idea
[14753.19s -> 14757.91s]  But if for some reason there was ever the ability to oh, hey, no, no, no, no
[14757.99s -> 14762.63s]  Everybody can stream that like up to 20k or up to like 15k. I would do 1080p
[14762.95s -> 14766.15s]  Yeah, I think now it actually
[14766.31s -> 14771.99s]  Like basically gets throttled that it really doesn't let you go above and it used to let you go a little bit above
[14772.15s -> 14777.35s]  I don't know. It's all weird. Where do you use the medallion? Right? Uh, I think it's right here
[14777.59s -> 14781.19s]  I think it's this one. Is this the right lift or did I mislead us?
[14784.02s -> 14790.93s]  Um, this should be I have rolls rolls medallion. Is this not right rolls royce? It's the wrong medallion
[14791.25s -> 14796.93s]  I think chat correct me if i'm wrong. We can go through here. Can we oh, yeah, this is uh, this is the dectus
[14797.01s -> 14802.93s]  I don't I only have the left for dectus. We can go in the tunnel and up right? Yeah. All right. Follow me
[14803.68s -> 14810.13s]  Yeah, I know. I know where we're going. Then you don't have any of the symbols or the I don't think so
[14814.31s -> 14840.47s]  No, I don't have any of them. The one you have is for uh, landell. Hope this doesn't hurt nice smithing stone one
[14846.53s -> 14848.90s]  Stop off that
[14850.34s -> 14852.34s]  No, no, you have you have to go down through the waterway
[14852.50s -> 14861.03s]  Yeah from uh the lake or we could uh, let's go up into the capital. We should
[14861.59s -> 14868.96s]  Kill radan or you mean you mean I I really do want to kill radon. Well, let's just get the bonfire up here
[14869.76s -> 14877.86s]  I guess we could talk to ronnie. What did I just go up?
[14878.80s -> 14880.00s]  Here again
[14880.00s -> 14882.48s]  Do you think you'd yeah, I was gonna ask but whatever
[14883.44s -> 14889.72s]  I'm being a weirdo
[14889.72s -> 14894.04s]  Where do we talk to her? What are we doing? I don't know. I haven't talked to her once this whole playthrough
[14894.20s -> 14898.24s]  So I have no idea where she is now. I think you talked to it. You talked to her first, right?
[14899.08s -> 14905.28s]  And then I don't know where she is now at her, uh her tower. I think she's at the tower like her tower
[14905.60s -> 14909.32s]  Which is here somewhere, right? Isn't it like up here?
[14911.41s -> 14916.53s]  Yeah. Yeah, she has the tower next to
[14917.25s -> 14921.54s]  Her puppet man
[14921.54s -> 14929.88s]  Now I would be her puppet, you know given the chance ronnie will probably take even longer
[14931.72s -> 14935.43s]  Whatever not in any rush or anything
[14951.72s -> 14954.36s]  I am going to request a bathroom pee break
[14954.84s -> 14956.60s]  Uh very soon here though
[14956.60s -> 14959.56s]  Okay, I could really use one of those as well for my bladder pees
[14960.44s -> 14996.02s]  Oh, yeah, you can write the worst up here
[14997.30s -> 14999.30s]  You really shouldn't be able to but
[14999.30s -> 15006.42s]  Should go pee I will after we get this situated
[15006.90s -> 15019.11s]  Jimmy you've spent 19 years sleeping
[15023.88s -> 15032.90s]  What i'm gonna do the math on that. Let's say you sleep six to eight hours a night
[15033.22s -> 15036.21s]  Let's say seven hours average right six seven hours average
[15038.16s -> 15054.36s]  I'm 37 so that's somebody do that math. How many years have I been asleep a third of your whole life?
[15054.68s -> 15058.24s]  How long have I been asleep for 12?
[15058.72s -> 15064.16s]  0.3 years. I've been I was sleep. I've slept for 12.3 years
[15064.80s -> 15067.11s]  I don't like that statistic
[15068.72s -> 15074.80s]  That makes me feel like life is passing by 12 years. I was asleep for 12 years of sleep
[15077.19s -> 15078.95s]  Yeah, wake up
[15078.95s -> 15081.34s]  wake up
[15081.34s -> 15089.54s]  12.3 years asleep. How many years have you spent pissing?
[15090.18s -> 15093.22s]  In that that's another crazy one. Yeah, okay
[15094.34s -> 15097.38s]  Somebody calculate all this you spend 45 minutes in the bathroom
[15097.94s -> 15102.34s]  Every time you go and you go how many times today you're going wait. We need to do this very very
[15102.50s -> 15103.70s]  Wait
[15103.70s -> 15106.63s]  Hold on if it takes let's say it takes me between
[15107.66s -> 15112.58s]  15 to 60 seconds to piss sometimes it's a big one. Let's just say on average
[15112.58s -> 15116.26s]  It's like I I thought we went over this that you spend 40 minutes in the bathroom
[15116.34s -> 15121.43s]  And then but like just hold on peeing only. Oh my god, this is gonna be so scary
[15121.83s -> 15127.73s]  Okay, you guys ready? Let's do it. This is more important than playing the game. I don't care about the game
[15127.73s -> 15137.35s]  Just go you go. I'm talking to the people you are you're doing great if it's about 15 seconds to do a piss, right?
[15137.67s -> 15140.71s]  About 15 maybe 10 to 15. No
[15141.19s -> 15148.50s]  Um, yeah, how many times a day do you pee? I'm a chronic pee counter. No, you could continue
[15148.74s -> 15150.74s]  I was waiting for you to say the rest
[15150.82s -> 15151.86s]  What is that?
[15151.86s -> 15154.10s]  Sometimes when I I don't know when I was young
[15154.98s -> 15156.42s]  Definitely not anymore
[15156.42s -> 15160.02s]  Uh when I know that it's gonna be a real big pee. I'll just count it
[15160.34s -> 15164.82s]  Okay, like how how much pee is this and sometimes, you know, sometimes you hit a minute, dude
[15165.06s -> 15167.38s]  I feel like I pee
[15167.46s -> 15172.64s]  It depends but if i'm talking about an average, let's say it's five I feel like I pee every
[15174.44s -> 15179.11s]  Three to five hours then you also need to you need to
[15179.75s -> 15185.28s]  Factor in the long pees. Yeah, that's what i'm gonna do. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. This needs to be accurate
[15185.60s -> 15187.06s]  so
[15187.06s -> 15191.54s]  If it's let's say you pee every I pee probably every depends on the day
[15191.54s -> 15195.06s]  But like maybe every two to five hours every two three four hours
[15195.14s -> 15200.23s]  Maybe I feel like every couple of hours to four hours
[15200.39s -> 15205.76s]  I'm gonna say three hours average maybe three six nine 12 15 18 21 20
[15205.76s -> 15210.79s]  So let's say let's say I pee seven to ten times a day six to ten times a day
[15211.03s -> 15216.12s]  We're gonna say like seven is that pretty accurate?
[15216.36s -> 15222.12s]  So if I pee seven times a day times like 25 seconds
[15222.88s -> 15234.00s]  So seven times 25 is what that's a lot seven sounds like a lot to me. Is it i'm gonna go pee
[15234.64s -> 15241.28s]  Right now i'm gonna go pee when the stream is over. I mean, I probably also pee a lot
[15241.28s -> 15245.78s]  I've been drinking a lot of water. I've been hydrating. Maybe these people are like I do drink
[15245.94s -> 15249.14s]  I drink a lot of water. I do I drink not I don't want to call it a lot of water
[15249.14s -> 15251.81s]  But I I mean over the course of a day
[15251.81s -> 15257.76s]  I I definitely have at least six to eight ounces of of glasses of water a day
[15257.84s -> 15264.08s]  I have like six to eight eight ounce glasses of water a day. I think it would be fair
[15264.24s -> 15269.65s]  Let's just say let's just say five or six then six
[15269.73s -> 15273.49s]  Let's just say seven seven i'm gonna say seven because I feel like six i'm gonna say six six
[15274.23s -> 15282.40s]  Six times 25 is what seconds? Okay. I think I did the quest and i'm i'm gonna go pee
[15282.90s -> 15284.90s]  All right, you go. We're we're working through this
[15285.22s -> 15288.69s]  Yeah, figure out how long it takes me and then factor that in so it's about
[15289.39s -> 15294.98s]  37 to 47 days is how many how long you've peed a year?
[15295.91s -> 15299.67s]  No, wait, I thought I thought you meant a year that would be fucked up
[15300.69s -> 15306.28s]  So 47 how many how how i'm i'm 37 years old so two and a half minutes a day
[15308.31s -> 15317.38s]  How is that over over 37 years so it would be that so 27 days
[15317.70s -> 15334.79s]  We said I got 27 days. Okay, let's say 27 days and then let's do the other one the
[15335.75s -> 15336.47s]  other
[15336.47s -> 15340.45s]  You know number two I would say uh, probably
[15341.51s -> 15345.24s]  I this is weird to talk about on stream. I'm just gonna call it something else
[15345.48s -> 15350.85s]  I'm gonna combine a few because like I've probably puked a bunch in the bathroom, too
[15351.48s -> 15355.08s]  And so let's do all right how long i'm gonna say a day
[15355.72s -> 15360.68s]  I probably spend about and like showering and like brushing my teeth
[15360.68s -> 15368.55s]  I'm gonna combine everything maybe like 45 minutes to an hour a day
[15372.50s -> 15378.31s]  I would say at least one hour a day is spent cleaning, you know showering
[15378.87s -> 15381.59s]  Brushing my teeth going to the bathroom
[15383.41s -> 15390.74s]  Sometimes they're a little longer probably an hour a day. So one hour a day this 20 so one it's um, 37 years
[15391.14s -> 15397.19s]  Well, how many days is that? You know, i'm saying total across the whole day being in the bathroom. That's it showers
[15397.19s -> 15419.04s]  That's you know, the other thing that i've been said 1.3 years. So it's one and a half years
[15419.20s -> 15423.84s]  So then so let's just let's just round up to the one so one and a half years
[15424.00s -> 15429.20s]  I've been going to the bathroom or showering. I've showered for like a year
[15430.80s -> 15432.29s]  No
[15432.29s -> 15434.61s]  I've been on the toilet for a year and a half
[15441.30s -> 15446.96s]  Jesus plus the other stuff so i've spent like 15 years of my life
[15447.52s -> 15492.20s]  Sleeping brushing my teeth shitting puking or sleeping or taking a shower. I'll be back. Wow
[15492.36s -> 15494.55s]  I was trying I was muted
[15494.55s -> 15498.07s]  I said don't tell me this isn't an interesting conversation because it's a very interesting conversation
[15498.15s -> 15500.79s]  You know how long you've been doing something over the course of your entire life
[15500.95s -> 15508.77s]  It's an interesting conversation and i'm gonna mute you. Okay, because now it's my turn and i'm muting you now
[15508.77s -> 15510.77s]  It's your turn. I don't trust you
[15511.17s -> 15516.29s]  Like while you're gone, I might like say he's gone. Nope. Goodbye. Goodbye. See you later
[15516.77s -> 15773.08s]  All right, i'll be back
[15773.24s -> 15779.27s]  I'm gonna start doing that from now on when I come back. I'm just gonna very gently and lightly just kind of go
[15781.12s -> 15783.36s]  So people go oh he's back instead of being like hey
[15787.16s -> 15788.68s]  What is this title?
[15788.68s -> 15790.84s]  One and a half years in the bathroom
[15793.80s -> 15797.64s]  I didn't make this title
[15797.64s -> 15799.89s]  You still in the bathroom?
[15799.89s -> 15804.45s]  You're telling me you just spent 15 seconds peeing. No, actually I did time it. Did you time yours?
[15806.34s -> 15811.54s]  No, how could you have not timed it when we were just talking about it I really like
[15813.54s -> 15816.50s]  Didn't feel the need to I feel like I have enough data
[15817.22s -> 15825.99s]  I've done the work mine was exactly almost exactly 20 seconds. Okay, that's short
[15826.07s -> 15832.80s]  That's actually very short for how long we've been, you know going you stay hydrated there
[15833.38s -> 15835.06s]  Yeah
[15835.06s -> 15842.02s]  I mean I I did do a big full pee. All right, let's stop this and move on
[15843.12s -> 15848.79s]  Now what's your favorite kind of pasta? Have you ever cut an onion? All right
[15849.35s -> 15855.80s]  We're gonna go to that cave. What cave is that? Because I did the ronnie thing. I think oh wait
[15856.12s -> 15861.76s]  Starts. Oh does it? Well, how can we did you get a cutscene? No, what cutscene are you supposed to get?
[15862.32s -> 15868.37s]  Don't you get a cutscene before radan's there? I know I think we have to I don't know
[15868.37s -> 15873.25s]  I don't I don't remember ever getting a cutscene except for maybe when you go there and they talk about the festival
[15873.25s -> 15877.33s]  Let's warp there. Let's warp there. Let's work there right now right into the the plaza
[15877.57s -> 15908.16s]  Did you count in thousands or mississippi's? Um, just three three four four five five six
[15908.95s -> 15911.51s]  Uh, did it happen usually aren't they usually out here? No
[15911.83s -> 15912.15s]  No
[15912.15s -> 15918.18s]  And we when you gotta go up to altus plateau and we think we can go back down through the river and climb up
[15918.26s -> 15920.76s]  Though that way so what's the best?
[15921.68s -> 15923.68s]  On fire to sit at to do that
[15924.08s -> 15931.62s]  We'd have to start like all the way at that macaria gate and just go down to the left like here
[15933.76s -> 15946.00s]  Let's let's do that. I don't think you can go down here. Yeah, I don't think so. I think we have to go all
[15947.28s -> 15966.79s]  the way
[15966.79s -> 15969.09s]  That way it works
[15969.09s -> 15972.37s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, I know a better one. I know a better one. I know a better one
[15972.53s -> 15979.08s]  I know. Yeah, I know a better one
[15979.08s -> 15984.90s]  Well, this is right
[15984.90s -> 15986.90s]  people go down into the lake and
[15989.38s -> 15991.38s]  people are we
[15991.46s -> 15995.28s]  Saying a certain place to go to is it well i'm saying a certain place
[15996.88s -> 16001.70s]  Do you want to go do the turtles?
[16001.70s -> 16008.23s]  All right. So your plan is to go from here and then down and go duck. I see
[16009.11s -> 16012.47s]  Oh, sorry. I left first. I forget sometimes like you load in later
[16013.35s -> 16015.35s]  If yeah, you are the host it is
[16015.83s -> 16019.43s]  I have an extended loading screen more than you do
[16020.23s -> 16037.60s]  You don't want to go pet turtles
[16037.60s -> 16041.25s]  I love how you're the one that wants to pet the turtles
[16041.25s -> 16046.93s]  But you're the one that's been killing the turtles the whole time we've been playing I killed one turtle one too many
[16050.20s -> 16055.91s]  What is zeus?
[16055.91s -> 16062.15s]  Yeah, what is doing that? This area looks weird
[16065.09s -> 16067.32s]  In it
[16067.32s -> 16070.64s]  I went backwards
[16070.96s -> 16076.08s]  You did just go in the complete. Why was I following you? I just assumed you were going the right way
[16076.32s -> 16078.32s]  I was distracted by the zeus
[16078.72s -> 16087.43s]  It was just vibing. Hey, i'll tell you
[16088.56s -> 16091.36s]  Vibes have been vibes have been pretty good tonight. Would you say that?
[16092.80s -> 16097.76s]  I thought the vibes were good yesterday as well enough. You're trying to like compare like you're saying for you
[16097.76s -> 16099.76s]  The vibe was off vibe was not off for me
[16099.92s -> 16101.04s]  No, no, no, no
[16101.04s -> 16106.80s]  The vibes were off and on only at the very last 30 to minute 40 minutes of that of the stream
[16107.92s -> 16110.80s]  You know what I mean? Like when we couldn't beat the vibe vibes were kind of off
[16112.05s -> 16114.80s]  Vibes are on the entire time
[16114.80s -> 16116.80s]  Except for the last 30 minutes vibes are off
[16118.15s -> 16124.47s]  Vibes have been on this whole entire time. How do you feel the vibes would be just out of curiosity if
[16124.95s -> 16127.75s]  Every time we entered a boss room, we like beat it first try
[16131.56s -> 16135.32s]  Is that like good vibes or is that like this is a little bit too
[16135.88s -> 16141.40s]  Like we're too good. They need to stop us. I feel like how good we are. I feel like the vibes would be
[16142.98s -> 16143.94s]  not
[16143.94s -> 16144.98s]  Great
[16144.98s -> 16147.94s]  But uh, there's one kind of in parentheses after that
[16148.50s -> 16156.04s]  Okay vibes not great, but this is randomizer and it's possible that we just absolutely
[16156.60s -> 16163.08s]  Just power stack our weapons crazy and there's like a mad soldier in one of these rooms, right? Yeah, that's not
[16164.28s -> 16168.04s]  That's only happened once we're getting a lot of like actual bosses
[16169.21s -> 16177.00s]  They gotta be running out of them. Yeah, they gotta be running out of salamanders at some point and then put the other
[16177.32s -> 16180.90s]  Parentheses bracket around it. Whatever
[16181.70s -> 16187.06s]  Vibes not great, but this is random. I suppose we just power stack our weapons. There's a mad soldier in this room
[16187.70s -> 16195.24s]  That's an extreme title that that should be the stream title if i'm really honest that should be the title
[16203.02s -> 16209.67s]  God so stupid. Someone should just build a ladder here
[16225.03s -> 16227.27s]  I got another seed. Did you get the golden seed there?
[16228.07s -> 16230.87s]  It is not a golden seed for me. It's been a golden seed
[16231.75s -> 16237.27s]  On i'm not saying that's why you you were getting golden seeds from those. Yeah, i'm getting smithing stones from them
[16237.27s -> 16240.71s]  That's why my weapon is plus 28. So that's what's been going on
[16248.89s -> 16250.89s]  All right, I want to see what's in this back area
[16251.21s -> 16255.11s]  See if there's any consumable items picking up
[16255.91s -> 16260.81s]  bears in the wall
[16260.81s -> 16267.11s]  There is a bear in the wall. It's got like a fire buff
[16269.46s -> 16289.98s]  Okay, that's all
[16289.98s -> 16296.20s]  It's a good title. It's a very confusing title if you're
[16296.84s -> 16304.18s]  Not currently here right now. Oh
[16304.82s -> 16318.01s]  That's scary
[16319.53s -> 16339.61s]  You get it
[16339.61s -> 16344.49s]  Yeah, I got that mogul like I was kind of hoping that you were just gonna fall on your back by the screen
[16344.57s -> 16345.77s]  That would have been funny
[16345.77s -> 16362.46s]  Somebody said i've been having the stream in the background and I have this weird subliminal message of wanting smoothies. Did you do something?
[16363.61s -> 16368.33s]  It was yeah something you said something like that. I just paraphrased I paraphrased your entire comment
[16372.47s -> 16385.54s]  It was in that same ballpark. It was that same world. I think we gotta go up this ladder
[16387.43s -> 16402.10s]  That's not even real. This ladder goes up. Watch out. There's goons in here
[16405.66s -> 16409.66s]  Actually, this place is way worse usually. Oh cool. I found uh on the traps
[16410.38s -> 16413.75s]  is this the place where there's the
[16413.75s -> 16415.75s]  That big like a centipede bug thing
[16416.39s -> 16420.63s]  No, there's a million little baby boys and they all throw poison at you. Oh, okay
[16421.59s -> 16424.07s]  And there's like a bunch of traps on the ground as you run away from them
[16425.80s -> 16428.10s]  Is there an item? I think there is
[16429.19s -> 16431.19s]  Yeah, there's an item that's it's gonna be
[16431.35s -> 16433.75s]  Dung don't even it's gonna be like a glass shard
[16438.58s -> 16443.30s]  I remember my my elden ring playthrough. I was saying there's a lot of like moments like that where it's like
[16443.38s -> 16446.26s]  Oh, you missed the item going up the elevator to just like
[16447.38s -> 16451.86s]  To make it take longer to do something and then you go get it and it's like, oh you found like
[16452.66s -> 16455.27s]  I don't know
[16455.27s -> 16463.61s]  Nothing. I got a giant crusher the weapon called giant crusher. I think the point is sometimes the journey is more important than the destination
[16464.47s -> 16468.15s]  So it's being able to actually see that there's something cool for you to do
[16469.77s -> 16472.22s]  It's with any kind of reward
[16472.22s -> 16478.08s]  This is an interesting concept because it makes you feel like that you've done a good job paying attention to the game's environment
[16480.81s -> 16482.81s]  And I just got the axe of godric
[16483.29s -> 16485.29s]  changing character immediately
[16485.93s -> 16491.19s]  Again, this guy cannot use an item
[16492.79s -> 16494.79s]  For more than 30 seconds
[16496.94s -> 16498.94s]  I think that was a pretty good way to explain that
[16507.72s -> 16511.30s]  You want like a crossbow or anything?
[16511.30s -> 16514.90s]  No
[16514.90s -> 16522.39s]  Why not?
[16522.39s -> 16524.39s]  Did you need a somber seven?
[16524.79s -> 16526.07s]  Uh
[16526.07s -> 16529.45s]  I think you're at five. You need a six. Yeah, I need a six
[16530.09s -> 16532.17s]  You just go seven
[16532.17s -> 16534.17s]  Yeah, I have a seven
[16534.65s -> 16536.25s]  Yeah, I think we're both
[16536.25s -> 16538.73s]  In the same situation where I need I think I need
[16540.14s -> 16544.94s]  Sevens of regular I need a six and an eight and then the final one and I just think it'd be plus 10
[16545.66s -> 16552.42s]  I think I have an eight. Well, I don't
[16554.10s -> 16556.10s]  Everything's wrong. I want whatever that is
[16575.70s -> 16577.06s]  Slider goes up
[16577.06s -> 16583.53s]  I need to rest
[16583.53s -> 16585.75s]  Now poison's almost over
[16585.75s -> 16591.27s]  We were just at a bonfire right before we came through here. Yeah, but the poison they got they got a purple item for me
[16593.18s -> 16597.29s]  Battle I would refill my mana. That's true
[16603.10s -> 16609.38s]  Oh shit
[16609.38s -> 16611.38s]  No, no
[16617.08s -> 16648.04s]  What's up, what else is here? Well, it's a little scary. I think it's a free kill though. I didn't fall
[16666.23s -> 16667.43s]  Uh-huh
[16667.43s -> 16683.45s]  See what i'm dealing with here. Let's see what you're dealing with here a lot of um souls
[16683.77s -> 16694.60s]  Uh, there is an item up here. I should definitely come up here. I'm
[16696.60s -> 16698.62s]  Wait, how do you get up there?
[16698.62s -> 16704.63s]  Around the left side over here in the rocks. It's a koopy normal item
[16705.37s -> 16707.93s]  Oh, i'm getting it. I'm getting it
[16708.81s -> 16711.88s]  It's gonna be like a spell
[16711.88s -> 16714.44s]  It's gonna be like godric's last gall
[16715.08s -> 16719.94s]  But again, this is another place. I didn't know you can come up here
[16721.54s -> 16725.86s]  You're really teaching me a lot. I'm really learned. You're i'm really educated right now
[16726.42s -> 16734.79s]  Is there a mod they're using for seamless co-op? Yes
[16735.67s -> 16738.23s]  a seamless co-op
[16738.31s -> 16741.51s]  Uh, i'm gonna sing the praises of this mod another time
[16743.35s -> 16749.37s]  Randomizer was hard to set up just because it's like oh match the right seed and get all these things in the right folders
[16749.37s -> 16751.37s]  And make sure you set the right settings
[16751.37s -> 16752.89s]  Seamless co-op
[16752.89s -> 16754.71s]  is literally
[16754.71s -> 16756.60s]  Two files
[16756.60s -> 16761.48s]  It it's you don't have to do anything else besides just get the bit of passwords
[16762.28s -> 16764.58s]  it's
[16764.58s -> 16767.38s]  It's probably the easiest mod i've ever installed i've ever used
[16768.10s -> 16771.38s]  Would you say the same thing sir?
[16771.38s -> 16776.50s]  Uh, yeah, I guess a little bit complicated when you're trying to have exactly the same mods like the randomizer. Yeah
[16776.90s -> 16780.58s]  But the actual seamless co-op is just like a file in game folder done
[16781.99s -> 16785.13s]  It's actually insane word
[16786.55s -> 16789.67s]  I was concerned when we when we first started talking about this. I was concerned that
[16790.47s -> 16793.91s]  Oh, man, this is a whole ordeal. Isn't it? This is a whole thing
[16794.63s -> 16797.99s]  I see I felt bad too because I kind of turned it into a whole ordeal
[16798.47s -> 16799.67s]  Yeah
[16799.67s -> 16803.99s]  No, how did you exactly what you were trying to avoid, but how would you have known right like this?
[16804.55s -> 16807.24s]  There's no way you would have known
[16807.24s -> 16809.24s]  Please just let me feel bad. No
[16809.64s -> 16811.10s]  Step on me
[16811.10s -> 16812.38s]  No
[16812.38s -> 16814.06s]  It's undeserved
[16814.06s -> 16817.18s]  It's undeserved
[16817.18s -> 16822.06s]  There's no way you would have known that with these two things together and the amount of trying to figure it
[16822.38s -> 16828.41s]  We had to figure it out
[16828.41s -> 16833.69s]  I really do. Um, I mentioned it yesterday and then you like ignored me and then didn't hear me and probably
[16834.49s -> 16838.81s]  Just like spit on the ground on your stream. Yeah, but i've heard i've heard
[16841.18s -> 16845.18s]  Yeah, I don't it could be a good one. What if it's a legendary? What if you missed it? Yeah, okay
[16848.74s -> 16850.78s]  lump of flesh
[16850.78s -> 16852.66s]  Sorry, I made you do that
[16852.66s -> 16856.50s]  Uh, I was gonna say like I don't know if you want to try neo 2 sometimes because I did hear it was really good
[16856.58s -> 16858.50s]  and it also has like
[16858.50s -> 16860.50s]  The co-op just kind of works
[16862.65s -> 16865.53s]  Is I tried to play neo a few times?
[16866.78s -> 16869.02s]  Just on my own time
[16869.10s -> 16871.82s]  I just didn't I didn't like all the stance switching stuff
[16872.46s -> 16874.62s]  I yeah, I was a little annoyed by
[16875.34s -> 16879.66s]  How overly complicated it was too. I'm not sure if that's still a thing
[16881.29s -> 16887.37s]  I say I want it simple exhausted by that as well. I just want it. I just want light attack heavy attack
[16887.45s -> 16892.41s]  You can call me just an absolute small brain andy. That's fine. But like I just want it swing
[16893.21s -> 16894.49s]  regular swing
[16894.49s -> 16896.89s]  Strong swing and the weapons are cool. It's just
[16897.69s -> 16901.61s]  I don't like the stances like up down, you know the distance it's that that stance that stance
[16907.67s -> 16909.67s]  It's definitely really cool
[16910.92s -> 16917.24s]  It just gives you more tools to play with but I want less tools and if that makes me a dope then so be it
[16918.55s -> 16920.63s]  No, that makes sense. I agree with you. I
[16922.63s -> 16924.26s]  It was a lot
[16924.26s -> 16926.26s]  It was it's certainly a much less like
[16926.74s -> 16933.14s]  It's weird to say that because like dark souls isn't a casual experience, but neo was like even less of a casual experience
[16936.10s -> 16938.10s]  Where does neo sit?
[16938.82s -> 16940.82s]  Where like sakiro?
[16941.27s -> 16944.55s]  like is neo harder than sakiro is neo kind of more
[16945.50s -> 16952.23s]  Kind of challenging and more skill-based than sakiro was I I didn't play a lot. I don't know
[16952.55s -> 16958.39s]  It's harder than sakiro really. Oh my goodness. I don't think I do remember it being very hard
[16959.43s -> 16963.43s]  And it has like a whole I think neo 2 has like a whole like end game loot finding like
[16964.07s -> 16967.03s]  Find like item stuff farming and whatnot
[16967.99s -> 16973.85s]  So I imagine it just keeps getting harder sakiro is easier to be honest, huh?
[16976.60s -> 16983.35s]  Wow
[16983.35s -> 16985.11s]  What's that?
[16985.11s -> 16990.68s]  fist weapon
[16990.68s -> 16991.96s]  It is
[16991.96s -> 16998.33s]  star fist
[16998.33s -> 17000.49s]  Holy shit. These are cool
[17000.49s -> 17002.87s]  What this is awesome
[17002.87s -> 17007.22s]  time to change
[17013.37s -> 17015.37s]  Neo is more bullshit difficulty than anything
[17018.57s -> 17023.29s]  It looks really fun. It looks really cool. I just I tried to play it a few times
[17023.93s -> 17027.10s]  I just that the first zone
[17027.66s -> 17031.18s]  Just I I leave at the same point in the first zone every time
[17032.89s -> 17036.89s]  After like the first hour to two hours like almost I want to say up to three hours
[17036.97s -> 17039.05s]  It's like yeah, no i'm not into this and I leave
[17039.53s -> 17049.26s]  Did I miss an item? It is kind of bullshit. I feel like this conversation is actually turning me more like i've been wanting to play it
[17049.50s -> 17050.78s]  I bought it
[17050.78s -> 17052.78s]  And this conversation is like, you know what?
[17053.26s -> 17057.82s]  Maybe not. I really do feel like and if it's it is bullshit difficulty. I don't know
[17058.38s -> 17060.94s]  Well, how does neo one compare to neo two?
[17062.14s -> 17064.14s]  Is neo two like a better
[17064.54s -> 17066.78s]  less bullshit kind of better game
[17067.58s -> 17070.52s]  I think they were saying that that's what
[17070.84s -> 17076.76s]  Neo is also bullshit. They're saying it's way better though. Like it's way way better. I heard it was very good
[17077.64s -> 17080.12s]  Because around the time that like I finished elgin ring
[17080.44s -> 17084.68s]  There was a lot of comments on uh neo two like the reviews on steven that were like yeah
[17084.68s -> 17087.72s]  I beat elgin ring and I need it. I like need it more
[17088.52s -> 17091.24s]  So we all came here and this game's actually pretty good
[17094.57s -> 17098.89s]  So the magma worm is supposed to be up here, but I wonder if it's not a magma worm
[17099.88s -> 17101.72s]  I hope it's a magma worm
[17101.72s -> 17105.80s]  It's gonna make me very happy if it were a magma worm
[17106.44s -> 17117.18s]  I hope I just didn't break something
[17117.18s -> 17126.46s]  Are we getting a cutscene or am I in my computer crashing? You might be computer crashing. Yep. Well i'll be here
[17127.30s -> 17129.08s]  Okay, i'm gonna beat the boss
[17129.08s -> 17134.68s]  Don't go in don't do the boss reveal randomizer boss reveal without the other player. That's bm
[17140.84s -> 17142.36s]  Oh my god, it's elgin
[17147.03s -> 17162.76s]  Sounds cool, and then you then you beat it and the game ends. Oh, I think I crashed again
[17163.94s -> 17164.90s]  Oh
[17164.90s -> 17167.70s]  On start spicing things up on startup this time weird
[17170.84s -> 17217.24s]  Did you use the right launcher? Yeah, this is hard crashed. Okay, let's try that again. Come on. Come on, please
[17224.15s -> 17228.92s]  Okay. No good. Thank god. It looked like it crashed again, but i'm good. I'm coming back
[17243.74s -> 17246.30s]  Uh, can you put a new one of those thingies down?
[17251.69s -> 17252.65s]  I did
[17252.65s -> 17273.27s]  I feel bad for that version of my character because they're just gonna get their ass kicked
[17277.05s -> 17282.25s]  I think what happened is we both sat down and we both I I had touch grace was on my um
[17282.65s -> 17286.65s]  Indicator and I think we both did it at the exact same time and I think it crashed me
[17296.49s -> 17300.17s]  I can't believe this is elden beast. Don't say don't go in yet. Don't go in yet
[17302.98s -> 17305.54s]  Uh, I have too many souls and I want to level up. We do this
[17313.66s -> 17317.34s]  I can't believe this is elder. Yes. Can I have some runes?
[17318.63s -> 17321.43s]  Can you have some runes? I need like 1200
[17322.54s -> 17325.98s]  Well, how many how many levels higher than me? Are you?
[17326.46s -> 17333.46s]  i'll be right back because I keep I feel like I keep loaning your runes and you're like
[17334.24s -> 17336.24s]  700 levels higher than me
[17344.52s -> 17345.88s]  I got a new staff
[17345.88s -> 17350.62s]  Do you want to look at it? What staff? I don't I probably don't need it. I have the staff
[17350.62s -> 17352.62s]  I want just not the magic I want
[17354.82s -> 17367.30s]  Okay, that's enough. What is that thing? When did I get this?
[17368.02s -> 17375.66s]  Boy this thing gives strength doesn't it now gives decks a bunch of boys
[17376.38s -> 17383.80s]  I should probably just put it on
[17383.80s -> 17386.68s]  Why not? It'd be more damage, right?
[17389.26s -> 17391.26s]  And this scales a little bit off decks. All right
[17391.42s -> 17393.14s]  You ready?
[17393.14s -> 17398.44s]  All right. Oh my god, I didn't even upgrade
[17402.06s -> 17403.26s]  All right, ready
[17403.26s -> 17405.26s]  Now I am officially ready to go. Let's go
[17405.82s -> 17410.81s]  What is it gonna be?
[17410.81s -> 17412.57s]  it's gonna be
[17412.57s -> 17417.74s]  That's goku. It's
[17422.95s -> 17427.11s]  a
[17427.11s -> 17435.24s]  Um, what the fuck?
[17437.32s -> 17440.76s]  What the hell happened holy shit
[17441.88s -> 17445.88s]  Um, good luck. We're just we're not doing this. I don't think we're gonna beat this one
[17447.08s -> 17449.08s]  I think we're not beating this one
[17453.99s -> 17456.47s]  We gotta the thing we're gonna break the thing on his ankle. Where is it?
[17457.82s -> 17459.18s]  Which ankle is it?
[17459.18s -> 17465.32s]  Which leg I can't even I don't want what leg is it on?
[17466.12s -> 17470.90s]  It's on his left leg
[17470.90s -> 17475.30s]  Is he wearing a tumeric bracelet? Yeah, we gotta get the tumeric bracelet. It's on his left leg
[17476.89s -> 17480.54s]  Okay. Well, it's probably on the leg. That's like like a lower half
[17481.93s -> 17484.54s]  Good luck, man
[17484.54s -> 17489.53s]  We actually did a good amount of damage
[17489.53s -> 17493.45s]  Yeah, gonna break the bracelet on his left leg. The second phase is gonna be horrible here
[17505.48s -> 17512.26s]  Uh-oh
[17512.26s -> 17515.30s]  What the fuck? I don't know dude. It's not where did that fire come from?
[17518.47s -> 17521.51s]  This is phase two. It is you're right. He's
[17522.55s -> 17525.90s]  What?
[17525.90s -> 17528.22s]  That's right. The bracelet's already broken
[17533.43s -> 17540.54s]  What he summoned the slow moving things and they like finally caught up to me and it convoked me
[17540.86s -> 17542.86s]  We're gonna we're gonna be here for a little while
[17544.44s -> 17547.24s]  Yeah, you I I walked in and I saw him shooting in the air
[17547.24s -> 17552.01s]  He's like that's weird because he doesn't do that until phase two. He had a great
[17552.57s -> 17556.02s]  Uh entrance though probably best entrance of the whole time. We've been playing
[17556.58s -> 17558.26s]  Yeah, I don't think this is gonna be hard
[17558.26s -> 17561.70s]  As long as we're not being like sabotaged by like someone telling me to like fight the ankle
[17563.64s -> 17566.52s]  And like can't find out which leg and he literally only has one leg
[17567.24s -> 17571.80s]  But I I thought it was very I don't know that you fight the ankle on phase one
[17572.28s -> 17576.04s]  I'm just saying there's a couple of things with your story that are not lining up
[17578.60s -> 17581.00s]  Okay, wait i'm gonna put on some like fire resistance or something
[17581.64s -> 17588.36s]  Oh, yeah, let's cheese it and like be prepared for the fight like losers. Yeah
[17590.15s -> 17591.75s]  Let's like
[17591.75s -> 17594.55s]  Prepare for this fight you fucking dweeb
[17595.19s -> 17598.55s]  Get in here i'm putting gear on and why I don't
[17599.19s -> 17601.83s]  I need to get my fire resistance. Oh, hurry up
[17602.23s -> 17605.43s]  Magma giant just get on the horses skip the whole game and then uh,
[17605.51s -> 17610.47s]  Missed seven bosses in ten areas and y'all ramp it up already fire resistance gear on
[17610.95s -> 17618.49s]  Coming that's the same damage if you dodge it
[17626.46s -> 17634.58s]  All right tack the hands
[17634.58s -> 17636.18s]  Okay
[17636.18s -> 17657.83s]  That was dumb
[17657.83s -> 17661.35s]  Jesus how did I not get hit by that? I have no idea
[17662.07s -> 17670.30s]  Why does he move his hand?
[17670.30s -> 17688.04s]  That is really annoying
[17688.04s -> 17690.47s]  What the fuck?
[17691.27s -> 17693.27s]  He is really he actually is
[17699.43s -> 17703.11s]  Stop every time I go for the hand. I just he just instant moves it
[17703.83s -> 17720.21s]  We're doing pretty good
[17720.21s -> 17721.99s]  staggered really
[17721.99s -> 17728.82s]  Is there a place to hit him anywhere?
[17729.14s -> 17742.84s]  His hands. I mean I like uh, but I don't think he has a stab point
[17747.72s -> 17752.01s]  Uh, it's bullshit again
[17752.09s -> 17754.09s]  Oh my god
[17765.22s -> 17780.74s]  What oh
[17780.74s -> 17784.26s]  Stop moving. Oh my god. I feel like I just crushed like a bug
[17784.98s -> 17789.96s]  He's going psycho mode on you
[17789.96s -> 17796.87s]  Yeah, he is
[17796.87s -> 17799.51s]  I don't know why i'm casting this magic. It's too powerful
[17804.15s -> 17806.15s]  Make it rain
[17809.43s -> 17810.71s]  Why does that
[17810.71s -> 17816.31s]  That's like why is that up there? Why is make it rain make it rain. Why is it up there?
[17816.55s -> 17818.55s]  I don't know where why it's up there in your head
[17819.59s -> 17821.51s]  Why not?
[17821.51s -> 17828.55s]  Oh now now you just made me laugh and now i'm having problems. I was dodging every attack. Everything was going so smoothly
[17835.26s -> 17845.30s]  Make it rain
[17845.30s -> 17856.12s]  Make it rain
[17856.12s -> 17859.08s]  When was the last time you even played that game seriously?
[17859.80s -> 17863.85s]  Uh, I don't know years and years
[17865.69s -> 17868.97s]  I actually played like once a year ago, maybe with uh
[17869.77s -> 17871.77s]  Like moon was playing
[17873.35s -> 17875.35s]  It's still like a pretty fun game
[17876.39s -> 17878.87s]  It is yeah, i'm surprised they still get like a whole bunch of content
[17883.24s -> 17887.32s]  Nice job a lot of my chat. I don't think god it's it's a quote from smite
[17888.97s -> 17892.41s]  When uh, one of the characters who shoots fireballs is make it rain
[17893.53s -> 17895.53s]  Yeah, it's agony
[17895.69s -> 17897.45s]  Agni has this move
[17897.45s -> 17901.53s]  It only in one of his skins but germa. I i'm aware that germa loves it
[17902.25s -> 17905.45s]  I mean, it's just I have not heard that in a very long time
[17906.09s -> 17908.89s]  I got a sacred tear
[17908.89s -> 17913.61s]  I totally spaced out and I was thinking about swag knee. I think I got one too. I don't even know
[17914.65s -> 17917.37s]  Oh, the doubters lost out big time. I think here
[17920.38s -> 17922.46s]  Sorry doubters. You lost a lot
[17923.83s -> 17925.83s]  I my personal recommendation
[17926.31s -> 17928.31s]  Is to be a believer
[17928.31s -> 17930.15s]  from this point forward
[17930.15s -> 17939.56s]  Yeah, I would say so too. I have enough to level up again more strength
[17940.36s -> 17948.57s]  Really? Oh
[17948.57s -> 17949.69s]  Hold on
[17949.69s -> 17954.23s]  It's 26. I think
[17954.23s -> 17958.63s]  You know you see the runes needed number all the time, but the second that it goes away
[17958.87s -> 17960.95s]  It's gone from your memory. Has it happened to you too?
[17962.68s -> 17965.00s]  I haven't I honestly have been like forgetting to level
[17966.20s -> 17973.75s]  Constantly, so I really haven't been looking at that. However, I can relate in programming
[17975.00s -> 17979.08s]  Constantly open up something then like oh, yeah, I need to do that and i'll close a window and be like wait
[17981.30s -> 17993.08s]  What was I doing?
[17993.08s -> 17995.61s]  No object permanence
[17995.61s -> 17999.85s]  You know, I do envy people that have really really good object permanence
[18001.34s -> 18003.50s]  I just how do you how do you have good?
[18004.70s -> 18005.82s]  All right
[18005.82s -> 18007.90s]  What's the scale? Okay. Let me paint a picture for you
[18009.74s -> 18013.90s]  If you you know go somewhere you take you know, you take your car you go somewhere
[18013.98s -> 18019.50s]  I'm gonna go the the store or you lost me. You actually lost me already. All right, but just anybody that's listening
[18020.22s -> 18027.50s]  Don't have a license. I can't relate. Okay, so then just you just can hang out. I
[18028.14s -> 18035.10s]  Always no matter what doesn't matter where I go where I park. I always don't know the exact location of my car
[18036.26s -> 18041.00s]  Every time even when I say I look at the parking space. I go this is where I am
[18041.08s -> 18045.59s]  I got to remember this an hour goes by two hours go by and then it's just
[18046.31s -> 18051.51s]  I know the general vicinity of where the car is, but I don't have any idea where it is
[18051.99s -> 18055.19s]  That's not object permanence. Yes, it is. That's that's literally
[18056.12s -> 18061.56s]  ADHD that's object permanence. That's you keeping a thing in your brain and knowing where it is
[18062.42s -> 18068.73s]  That's object permanence. How's that not object permanence? It's the same thing. That's memory. What do you mean?
[18069.51s -> 18079.74s]  Object permanence is like forgetting something exists when it's outside of your view. I don't do that
[18079.90s -> 18088.76s]  I just forget where it is. I know it exists. I just don't know where like okay this big stone
[18089.00s -> 18092.36s]  Okay, so I guess I guess you're like you're like a five on the scale five out of ten
[18092.44s -> 18101.51s]  Yeah, it's not that bad and a one is like a toddler and you're like four points away from that object permanence would be hold on
[18101.59s -> 18108.09s]  Somebody said something. I want to read it. You have a bad memory. Yeah, so what object permanence?
[18109.21s -> 18114.57s]  Is is how peekaboo works with babies? Wait a minute. Yeah, that is
[18115.13s -> 18118.65s]  Object permanence would be if you forgot your car existed
[18122.60s -> 18127.40s]  Because he said it first and I saw it and I caught it it was in my mind a little bit object permanence problem there
[18127.64s -> 18131.00s]  But I did see it and I didn't I didn't I forgot it for a second. Then you said it
[18132.04s -> 18135.40s]  You like absolutely tuned me out. Can I turn my mic up? Like is there a problem?
[18135.48s -> 18138.73s]  You said I was quiet the other day. Are you there? Hello?
[18140.81s -> 18142.57s]  It's poor awareness
[18142.57s -> 18145.45s]  Whatever it is. It's what I have. It's awareness
[18147.38s -> 18152.50s]  It's it's all it's awareness. It's memory object memory awareness
[18153.06s -> 18154.42s]  Is that better?
[18154.42s -> 18157.02s]  Give a shit memory
[18157.02s -> 18162.14s]  Yeah
[18162.14s -> 18167.74s]  I lose my keys all the time my wallet memory. Yes, it is. No, no
[18167.90s -> 18169.90s]  How is losing your keys not memory?
[18170.30s -> 18176.30s]  It's not memory. This is a symptom of adult adhd where if you put something down you forget where it is
[18176.86s -> 18178.22s]  Not because your memory is bad
[18178.22s -> 18181.66s]  But what is forgetting about something else because your attention is on something else
[18181.74s -> 18186.86s]  You're not forgetting because you'd never have the memory of putting it somewhere because you're not focused on that
[18186.86s -> 18191.34s]  You're focused on something else, but that's memory. That is a that is you're talking about a piece of your memory
[18191.74s -> 18195.66s]  Short-term memory is memory short-term memory. Don't let him cook
[18196.38s -> 18204.81s]  No, let me eat. Okay. I'm done cooking. Okay. Uh, we I believe we just I think we we did it
[18209.96s -> 18221.42s]  We did it. Yeah, I think we can go fight radon. I'm barely certain we can go I think and i'm really really praying
[18222.55s -> 18226.15s]  That radon is like a normal soldier in a in a big empty desert
[18238.57s -> 18241.07s]  I think your dementia is contagious
[18247.44s -> 18250.08s]  I voted to teleport it was something going on. I did too
[18251.66s -> 18253.74s]  Did we pick the wrong one? I don't think so
[18255.61s -> 18257.93s]  Red main castle plaza. I think that's yeah, that's the one
[18259.21s -> 18263.61s]  Sometimes it's just a little weird. It can be a little weird
[18264.17s -> 18280.51s]  Turma has to buy a new car every time he leaves the house
[18282.59s -> 18284.59s]  Well, I never had a car before
[18284.75s -> 18289.07s]  I guess I have to have I guess I have to get one and i've got to i'm gonna drive
[18289.71s -> 18296.49s]  Oh, you hear the halo music?
[18316.57s -> 18318.57s]  Before we begin did you cut him off?
[18319.93s -> 18321.93s]  I'm in the cutscene. Yeah, I am too
[18323.53s -> 18325.88s]  Are we skipping?
[18325.88s -> 18328.12s]  Yeah, you want to watch his horse?
[18328.28s -> 18332.12s]  Die, do you want to watch his horse die? No, I we've i've seen this cutscene a lot
[18333.00s -> 18338.44s]  Okay, it's kind of like fucked up. I don't want to fight him yet because I have a lot of uh,
[18339.48s -> 18345.88s]  I need to level up. We're gonna win. We're gonna first try dude. No coward coward coward first try coward first try coward
[18345.88s -> 18347.24s]  There's a lot to lose
[18347.24s -> 18350.12s]  First try coward. You'll pick it back up when we go in again if we die
[18350.20s -> 18356.12s]  What we're gonna first try it you you agreed when I said no more doubters object permanence andy you should believe now
[18357.44s -> 18359.44s]  Short-term memory andy you think i'm gonna
[18359.44s -> 18361.56s]  Come on
[18361.56s -> 18363.56s]  Come on
[18365.60s -> 18369.80s]  Lot to lose there man
[18369.80s -> 18372.20s]  I thought I was gonna be alive. I really did
[18372.76s -> 18388.44s]  I was I thought it was gonna be like two hp, you know, I need to get my I need to get those back
[18388.92s -> 18397.79s]  Dude, you got this wrong object permanence would be forgetting the ground exists
[18400.38s -> 18404.06s]  How extreme are we going? Uh, that's okay. That's very extreme
[18404.06s -> 18408.94s]  I forgot that I am an object and that actually I am inhabiting this body on earth
[18409.66s -> 18414.94s]  I thought I was on the astral plane. I dreamed that I was a butterfly. I feel like there's there's levels
[18414.94s -> 18417.10s]  There's tiers of this. It's not just like
[18418.12s -> 18423.48s]  Oh object permanence issue. That means you must not understand. Yeah that you're holding a sword
[18423.72s -> 18427.16s]  You let it go and then you picked it up and it's the first time you've ever seen it
[18429.42s -> 18433.42s]  That's uh, that's augerins. Will they be down first try? I don't know. This is a good
[18433.50s -> 18435.50s]  This is tough because we who know it could be
[18435.74s -> 18437.50s]  It could be something really annoying
[18437.50s -> 18440.94s]  That's the first try. This is the first triangle. I we're not i'm not losing this
[18440.94s -> 18445.34s]  I'm committed to not losing this and i'm 100 sure. This is going to be like a crab
[18446.46s -> 18448.88s]  And what is it?
[18448.88s -> 18452.84s]  Star it's godric
[18452.84s -> 18458.20s]  Uh phase two godric or we're gonna summon everybody. We have to see that. We have to see what that
[18458.76s -> 18460.76s]  No, we do. I want to see what the outfits are
[18461.48s -> 18464.84s]  They're all gonna have funny outfits. That's that's true
[18465.56s -> 18467.88s]  The voters didn't know we were summoning all the guys
[18468.68s -> 18470.68s]  This guy's got fucking rivers of blood
[18473.40s -> 18475.32s]  Just let them fight
[18475.32s -> 18479.00s]  Don't even play the game just summon everybody because there's no there's no way they're gonna die
[18481.93s -> 18486.25s]  If you bet against this yeah true actually if you bet against this you are you just trying to lose your money
[18486.41s -> 18487.93s]  I'm just trying to lose your points
[18487.93s -> 18494.44s]  Now here's the real question. Where is godric? Are they just hanging out somewhere? He's gonna be up on the hill
[18494.60s -> 18499.24s]  What is what is uh, what does blade have for like stuff? He looks the same. Let's see
[18500.59s -> 18503.10s]  Yeah
[18503.10s -> 18507.10s]  Yeah, he might be like what are you doing dude? You gotta you gotta walk up there with the boys

[18515.32s -> 18516.20s]  Oh
[18516.20s -> 18519.72s]  For some reason I was thinking of a different boss. All right, let's see how they do
[18524.28s -> 18526.36s]  Wait, there's more people to summon up there. There's uh
[18527.08s -> 18529.29s]  Is this
[18529.29s -> 18533.50s]  I know there's like a healer, right?
[18533.50s -> 18534.94s]  Yep
[18534.94s -> 18538.03s]  maiden
[18538.03s -> 18547.98s]  All right, let's see how they do
[18547.98s -> 18549.74s]  Somebody died already
[18549.74s -> 18557.45s]  Dude, if you guys can't beat godric, I don't know how you ever thought you're gonna beat radon
[18564.14s -> 18571.05s]  Where's sigward this is a major let your ambitions to rest moment
[18579.36s -> 18581.36s]  No, you should have waited
[18584.35s -> 18588.83s]  They're dying dude. Yeah, they're not doing that great the healers on the look at the healer behind us
[18589.47s -> 18598.46s]  They're stuck. Oh, no, is she stuck? Yeah, she was stuck inside all the rubble. Come on quinn get in there
[18599.10s -> 18608.83s]  She's kind of smart
[18608.83s -> 18613.98s]  She's waiting for the real gamers to get in there before she buffs us
[18614.62s -> 18619.82s]  She's gonna be throwing lightning spears and show. Oh, wait, where's blade going?
[18622.78s -> 18624.78s]  Wait, where is he going?
[18625.76s -> 18628.06s]  Wait is it
[18628.06s -> 18629.90s]  Why is he running over here?
[18629.90s -> 18632.94s]  He's just floating in the sky on my screen. I think he died. All right, let's get him
[18640.38s -> 18642.54s]  Oh, they said you gotta run away from this shit. I forgot about that
[18645.20s -> 18647.20s]  I'm only doing comedy spell
[18647.36s -> 18650.56s]  I'm gonna need you to hold him in place
[18651.69s -> 18653.79s]  You got him. Thank you
[18653.79s -> 18655.07s]  God damn it
[18655.07s -> 18665.80s]  When does he go?
[18665.80s -> 18669.64s]  Giving the doubters some hope
[18669.64s -> 18671.64s]  I like the part where he goes
[18680.01s -> 18682.09s]  Scream stream
[18682.09s -> 18685.60s]  Yep, are we gonna actually does he do willy do phase two?
[18686.08s -> 18692.32s]  I wonder no no god have you been paying attention but he does phase two and half health not at the end of the health bar
[18692.80s -> 18697.68s]  He's gonna be a different boss, right? Like wait, he is gonna be a different boss. Oh crap
[18699.72s -> 18701.96s]  Uh-oh, how's your comedy looking now?
[18704.44s -> 18706.04s]  Even at half health
[18706.04s -> 18708.86s]  Like it's not him leaving. It's just him doing a cut scene
[18710.86s -> 18714.54s]  Here it is. Oh, he's actually oh he does do it. Have you been paying attention?
[18715.02s -> 18717.02s]  Don't make fun of me when you're the dope
[18717.82s -> 18730.04s]  See yeah, he hasn't been paying attention. All right, let's summon all of our friends again
[18731.16s -> 18734.96s]  Or is that cheating?
[18734.96s -> 18739.96s]  I don't know. It's at least like
[18739.96s -> 18741.80s]  Just get healed at least
[18741.80s -> 18743.00s]  I don't know
[18743.00s -> 18746.33s]  I feel like we should fight the character
[18746.65s -> 18748.65s]  All right, fine
[18748.73s -> 18753.10s]  Too bad. We don't have the music object music is the best in the game
[18763.32s -> 18765.32s]  No, don't kill our killer
[18765.71s -> 18784.35s]  What did she throw dude?
[18784.35s -> 18785.63s]  Oh
[18785.63s -> 18799.45s]  Finish him off. Don't usually use my full power
[18799.69s -> 18801.69s]  Oh, he killed me with it
[18801.77s -> 18804.56s]  I thought he was aiming at you
[18804.56s -> 18806.56s]  Hey, I thought I actually thought he was aiming at you
[18807.36s -> 18809.36s]  Oh shit, we're gonna lose
[18809.52s -> 18824.44s]  Uh, here comes the here comes the throw from the stir
[18839.80s -> 18841.64s]  I think it's freezing
[18841.64s -> 18843.64s]  You're kind of you are jumping around
[18843.64s -> 18852.01s]  Just a couple more hits. You got it. I rolled backwards like a dope
[18853.37s -> 18855.37s]  Okay
[18861.29s -> 18867.45s]  Hey, I got the wait. I have the right side of the uh, howling tree medallion. Do you have the left side? Yes
[18867.93s -> 18869.93s]  I believe so. Okay, we have that
[18870.84s -> 18873.00s]  I I again got three golden seeds
[18873.92s -> 18875.50s]  Jeez
[18875.50s -> 18879.74s]  All the bosses are just spitting seeds out at me. I don't know why that's pretty weird
[18881.24s -> 18883.56s]  Can you can you go over the cap in a randomizer or no?
[18883.64s -> 18887.74s]  Is it just gonna give you the amount that exists in the game? It should only be that amount
[18889.34s -> 18895.85s]  Can you sit at the bonfire? I'm watching the cuts. Okay. Sorry. You're not watching the cutscene. You're just waiting. I understand
[18896.81s -> 18897.77s]  um
[18897.77s -> 18901.05s]  Okay, I am elden ringing loading screen. I'm loading
[18905.61s -> 18911.24s]  It probably looks like i'm hitting like a vape over here. I keep going like I keep going like
[18914.08s -> 18919.23s]  It's a fucking drink container. Oh some hot cider
[18926.03s -> 18930.11s]  My game is in an infinite loading screen. I think okay. No, it actually
[18930.51s -> 18931.71s]  It's this I I fill it up
[18931.71s -> 18936.11s]  I was just worried that it might have like crashed because this is when it like changes the world state because he killed radon
[18936.43s -> 18943.66s]  There's some bonfire out here, right?
[18945.80s -> 18948.36s]  I it's supposed to be
[18948.44s -> 18950.84s]  There's something we might actually
[18951.98s -> 18956.94s]  Hold on do you is does radon have to die for the game to register that?
[18957.66s -> 18960.73s]  No, the cuts everything happened for no crone
[18961.13s -> 18962.73s]  Everything did happen. Okay
[18962.73s -> 18968.22s]  He said you you were in the cutscene, but where is the bonfire then?
[18968.62s -> 18973.02s]  It should be going down here. There's a there's a catacombs down here. I'll get that waypoint
[18987.07s -> 18992.76s]  You spectating i'm reading a comment. I heard you you said that you believe aliens built walmart
[18994.65s -> 18996.65s]  Um, I feel like that's something I probably said
[18997.21s -> 18999.21s]  So, I don't know. Yeah, I think that I guess
[19001.71s -> 19008.00s]  No, I definitely did I?
[19008.00s -> 19015.77s]  Um, I think that miyazaki. No, not miyazaki. He's the guy made um death stranding for a second
[19015.77s -> 19017.77s]  I thought you're gonna say that you you said
[19018.07s -> 19025.92s]  Miyazaki made walmart. No, no, no, it's weirder. Many actually said it who kojima kojima said that aliens did 9 11
[19026.60s -> 19038.38s]  Oh, where are you? Oh, that's right. I forgot about this cave. This looks weird. My game is very unhappy
[19038.46s -> 19043.58s]  I would be surprised if I didn't crash in like five seconds
[19045.63s -> 19048.59s]  I think this when I rest it'll kill you it'll murder you
[19049.61s -> 19052.41s]  And then you're gonna have to go back out into the desert and get your souls from there
[19053.64s -> 19059.82s]  bitch
[19059.82s -> 19066.08s]  DLC leak. Oh, we're seeing underneath iron forge duties. Wait, there is a there's a bonfire out here
[19067.98s -> 19073.40s]  Yeah, yeah, I couldn't see anything you were doing. Oh, I ran to the
[19076.73s -> 19078.65s]  You know, I kind of need to crush your head
[19080.80s -> 19097.80s]  What you are poking out of the ground just the top of your head is okay. I need to go over here
[19106.62s -> 19115.71s]  Uh, can you even agree to that? I can you probably gonna have to do it again though
[19117.15s -> 19120.19s]  Well, i'm saying because it's like a upon fire you don't have
[19121.37s -> 19128.44s]  I get it's there. I can see it. I think because you're the host. This is technically your game. So anything you do I get as well
[19129.45s -> 19135.79s]  Hailed. Yeah, it does it sometimes let's do it again. What's your favorite mobile game?
[19137.56s -> 19143.28s]  right now, uh
[19143.28s -> 19155.76s]  Pintar poker lame let's say it but play it and then tell me say it play it and then tell me
[19156.32s -> 19160.43s]  Say and play and then tell me pine tar poker play it and tell me
[19161.37s -> 19171.02s]  I would love to hear you. I'd love to hear you say that again after you play it. Okay. Okay. Do you like um, yahtzee?
[19173.92s -> 19179.28s]  I've never played yahtzee. Oh, that's another thing. He skipped. Oh my god, dude. You never played yahtzee and elden ring
[19184.22s -> 19188.46s]  Wait, is this like random? Yeah, this is like random enemy battleground. Oh, they keep spawning, right?
[19189.26s -> 19191.76s]  At least they should keep spawning
[19195.87s -> 19200.19s]  All right. I just I gotta pay attention what the hell's going on here. What is that? Is there a giant in here?
[19201.56s -> 19205.48s]  Uh, yeah, I heard the attack on titan. Yeah, he's down. He's down there
[19206.52s -> 19212.72s]  Okay. Well, let's just go to the boss
[19212.72s -> 19215.28s]  There's a lot of shit here. This is a big place if I remember
[19215.52s -> 19220.88s]  Oh, yeah, it's locked by some contraption. Yeah, we got to go up and jump through a window and out the window
[19221.04s -> 19223.04s]  Yeah, there's a lot. This is a wacky one
[19223.04s -> 19227.76s]  This one actually kind of sucks. It's one of the harder ones. I didn't spend my 87 000 souls
[19228.32s -> 19233.92s]  Yeah, I needed to die where we're going we're going back. Oh shit. This poor flower doesn't stand a chance
[19235.12s -> 19236.40s]  No
[19236.40s -> 19237.84s]  I'm just going back to the
[19237.84s -> 19255.24s]  At beginning
[19255.24s -> 19257.72s]  You're gonna feel the cold steel of my katana
[19259.53s -> 19261.84s]  Damn, that's like that's a lot
[19261.84s -> 19265.76s]  When does the the hard cap the soft cap is for uh attributes?
[19266.00s -> 19270.36s]  I believe it's 40. Is it 40 for like strength x intelligence 40, right?
[19270.84s -> 19275.18s]  Either 40 or 50. It's 60
[19276.33s -> 19279.61s]  Oh 40 60 80. Okay. Yeah, six. Yeah, that keeps diminishing, right?
[19288.84s -> 19294.84s]  How's everybody doing good? How you guys doing? How you doing? Everyone doing? Okay. Everyone good on water. Yes. Anyone need any uh,
[19296.30s -> 19300.62s]  Don't need anything that did sound like that. Didn't it like I was the host of a party
[19301.10s -> 19305.42s]  Everybody good you guys good. You need anything breadsticks. We're gonna get you. You guys good
[19310.52s -> 19314.12s]  How come all the shitty enemies are in the path we have to go and they're like not fighting each other
[19316.33s -> 19318.33s]  Um, that's a good question
[19318.33s -> 19323.32s]  This guy is very confused
[19324.12s -> 19325.64s]  Ooh
[19325.64s -> 19328.04s]  That still did a ton of health damage to me
[19329.36s -> 19334.24s]  Are you like a parry guy? Do you like it? Are you like you like parrying? I like parrying a lot
[19335.04s -> 19339.76s]  In any game what game has the best parry? This is a great stir question. I think
[19340.40s -> 19344.68s]  soul caliber
[19344.68s -> 19348.52s]  I that that was such an unbelievable statement. I'm so confused by that. I died
[19350.36s -> 19356.76s]  What what do you mean like what what game has the best parries soul calibers a lot of fucking awesome parries
[19356.92s -> 19360.92s]  But that sounds so interesting to me. I needed to explain a little bit in more detail
[19361.64s -> 19366.20s]  it's always been one of the main mechanics of soul caliber is if you press like any character can press like
[19367.12s -> 19371.76s]  Guard and down or garden up and you have to do the correct parry for if it's a low mid or high or like
[19371.84s -> 19376.64s]  There's characters with special parries that have like if you parry it then you like instantly go into another move
[19377.12s -> 19378.64s]  And it's uh, it's like a whole, you know
[19378.64s -> 19382.08s]  Just built-in system and it's very nice because it's you're like shield lights up
[19382.08s -> 19385.68s]  So, you know the timing for it very well and it makes it nice like when you get it and you feel good
[19387.45s -> 19393.37s]  That sounds actually really fun. Um, all right, but what about not like not multiplayer?
[19394.01s -> 19398.65s]  Just like a like a pve scenario. Well, who what a game has the best pve parry
[19399.77s -> 19405.36s]  Soul caliber two in the labyrinth mode. All right, okay
[19406.32s -> 19415.32s]  No, I I I would struggle to even think of uh, games besides like dark souls
[19416.60s -> 19418.60s]  Well, which from software game has the best parry then?
[19423.21s -> 19428.33s]  Trying to remember how it even worked in bloodborne because you didn't have parries you had like you used your gun to parry
[19430.67s -> 19435.47s]  I feel like dark souls one had a really just satisfying parry
[19435.95s -> 19440.60s]  I'm gonna be wrong though
[19440.60s -> 19446.60s]  I really do like just the general dark souls using the small little buckler. Yeah, and you do this thing you go you go like this
[19449.00s -> 19451.00s]  Yeah, and when you do it you go we
[19451.00s -> 19456.75s]  You make like a noise and it like gets into like noise of the year. We like that, right?
[19457.31s -> 19462.44s]  Yeah, I love that
[19462.44s -> 19464.44s]  Sekiro is uh
[19464.44s -> 19468.65s]  Sekiro is a rhythm game
[19468.65s -> 19471.10s]  It's like playing
[19471.10s -> 19478.65s]  Sekiro have you not have you not played soul caliber you and I played it I think in the same room at one point
[19479.29s -> 19480.89s]  Just like sitting around hanging out. Oh, yeah
[19480.89s -> 19483.85s]  We did it like a pax east when they were like showing a soul caliber four
[19484.01s -> 19488.46s]  Yeah, i'm not I really don't play fighting games. I'm really not into them
[19488.54s -> 19495.15s]  I just I mean some of the ones like I like like smash like i've played it a bunch
[19495.39s -> 19496.91s]  Multi versus is fun
[19496.91s -> 19504.99s]  But like not the the kind of like 2d plane fighting games where both characters are like this and they like are fighting this way
[19505.47s -> 19508.19s]  Well, actually that's multi versus and smash, but you know what I mean?
[19508.19s -> 19513.15s]  It's like zoomed in the camera. It's you know, i'm saying it's like the 1v1 just zoomed in camera
[19513.92s -> 19524.28s]  Yeah, I don't really like to play those. I'm not very good at them non platform statements went together
[19524.76s -> 19528.52s]  No, I I don't like non platform fighting games
[19528.84s -> 19534.44s]  I feel like you need a lot of knowledge to play them. Well, and I just don't really have the time
[19534.44s -> 19537.90s]  I want to give the time to it. Um
[19539.05s -> 19546.14s]  Do you know where the the mechanism is? I know I just I I have never like actually fought one of these enemies
[19546.14s -> 19552.57s]  I just avoid them. Oh, that's cursed and i'm dead
[19554.54s -> 19559.79s]  I forgot they had the curse. I forgot can you res me? Yeah, i'm gonna res you
[19560.35s -> 19570.65s]  Street fighter six. Oh, it's on cooldown. Do you another 20 minutes? Do you like street fighter?
[19571.05s -> 19575.21s]  Are you do you like to play street fighter? I'm interested in the new one and i'm always interested in them
[19575.21s -> 19580.33s]  But i've never really played them a lot. I have to reset but I was gonna say I mean like evo moment number
[19583.45s -> 19586.01s]  I think that shit's cool. I like parries the most in fighting games
[19586.01s -> 19590.01s]  so when you go like to when you're excluding all multiplayer games, you're kind of like
[19590.73s -> 19597.47s]  Oh, you've respawned this motherfucker right on top of me. He's easy. Geez. I was really upset
[19599.23s -> 19601.08s]  My game
[19601.16s -> 19603.16s]  All right, vince mcmahon
[19609.37s -> 19615.68s]  Um, okay, I got it it was it was like right there so when you
[19618.28s -> 19620.28s]  Where the fuck am I going?
[19620.68s -> 19625.00s]  I can't going back to the bonfire. Let's both meet over the bonfire then we can just walk to the boss. Okay
[19627.36s -> 19629.36s]  I'm guilty guilty. Here's fun, too
[19629.60s -> 19631.77s]  I like I like fighting games
[19634.52s -> 19638.94s]  What's the best soul caliber?
[19639.90s -> 19646.38s]  Uh, you're really gonna ask that you're really gonna you're really gonna put me there in that spot
[19646.94s -> 19651.10s]  Um, it has to be two. I found a weapon that you probably are gonna like
[19651.90s -> 19656.76s]  I found the carrion knight sword. It's like just a great
[19657.48s -> 19659.95s]  intelligence weapon
[19659.95s -> 19666.56s]  Uh, wait, what was it carry a knight sword? Oh, yeah. Uh, sure. I want it. I was gonna buy it earlier
[19666.64s -> 19672.16s]  It was in my uh dragonheart shop. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah, don't die. You're you're scarlet rod it, you know
[19672.24s -> 19674.96s]  You're you're a little stinky. So soul caliber two
[19676.06s -> 19678.76s]  Yeah, I mean I liked the newer ones a lot
[19678.76s -> 19683.00s]  But there's a lot of things objectively in them that I would feel like a bad person saying they were the best six
[19683.08s -> 19689.24s]  The most recent one is actually also I would I would put like two and six. They're both popped for different reasons
[19689.40s -> 19693.42s]  Really? So the newer one is good. Yeah, it's just
[19695.50s -> 19705.26s]  I don't know a weird amount of support where it gets overshadowed by tekken. I've got soul caliber is slower, right?
[19705.34s -> 19707.34s]  It's not like a
[19708.54s -> 19710.54s]  It's like a looker
[19711.02s -> 19717.56s]  It's a lot slower. Okay, I probably like it if I've really ever how was it compared to like mortal combat because mortal combat is
[19718.04s -> 19721.16s]  Not fast, but it's not really slow either. I'd say
[19722.43s -> 19728.03s]  Generally, it's probably even slower than mortal combat because a lot of the 2d fighters like that like your punch in mortal combat
[19728.27s -> 19733.44s]  Or in like street fighter a punch is like a three frame attack. We're just like it's happening
[19734.08s -> 19740.24s]  He punches but every like the slowest moves in the fastest moves, excuse me in slow caliber are 11
[19740.72s -> 19756.35s]  to like 15 frame range because I was marv versus capcom is like, um, what is that anyways, um
[19756.67s -> 19762.08s]  The problem that I always have with fighting games is especially something like like marv versus capcom for instance
[19762.89s -> 19767.26s]  It's just it's almost I can't really even this is actually going to be probably horrible
[19768.30s -> 19773.04s]  Yeah, depends on how much uh
[19774.00s -> 19779.52s]  Yeah, yeah, dude, you're you're fucking dead dude, um, we don't know we can skip this one
[19779.60s -> 19783.84s]  We don't have to do this one. No, we're doing this one. I need to learn like how this boss actually works
[19783.92s -> 19787.52s]  There is nothing to learn. It's literally just it just spams every ability it has
[19788.48s -> 19791.28s]  Do you have heals because heals actually do a ton of damage to this?
[19791.60s -> 19798.83s]  This is one of those enemies that I feel like they programmed like a bunch of extra moves and they forgot to take them out
[19803.84s -> 19809.20s]  Like this character's move set has like five extra swings that they just didn't delete from like the lines of code
[19813.69s -> 19817.29s]  This is yeah, like a sakiro enemy. You're just supposed to like auto parry everything
[19818.09s -> 19824.30s]  I might be able to do it because I have faith. Yeah
[19825.36s -> 19827.37s]  Can he be parried?
[19827.37s -> 19828.49s]  I
[19828.49s -> 19830.49s]  Doubt it. Who knows maybe
[19831.21s -> 19833.21s]  Timings are also so weird
[19835.88s -> 19838.12s]  And it screeches at you like a fucking child
[19839.40s -> 19840.76s]  everything about it
[19840.76s -> 19843.37s]  there's like the weird pig scream that like
[19844.89s -> 19849.04s]  I could probably do it if I really tried
[19849.12s -> 19850.48s]  it's like a
[19850.48s -> 19851.52s]  but
[19851.52s -> 19854.57s]  It's you you you an o shape with your mouth. It's
[19855.85s -> 19857.77s]  I could do it if I really wanted to
[19857.77s -> 19862.41s]  But I feel like I don't want to wake a bunch of people up like last time. I think I think you're good, dude
[19862.49s -> 19865.69s]  You're really trying to farm the worst sound today. I'm not even
[19866.25s -> 19868.73s]  Worse sound of the year every clip is going to be from this stream
[19869.53s -> 19874.33s]  Well, dude, I played elden ring for two months straight at the beginning of last year like
[19875.37s -> 19879.21s]  30 clips were nominated for stuff. So come on. It's we've been playing it a lot
[19884.28s -> 19886.28s]  Uh, hold on. Let me actually
[19886.28s -> 19892.64s]  Hold on how much faith do I have because I wonder if that heal really is something I should put on right now
[19893.28s -> 19906.51s]  Give me a sec
[19906.51s -> 19913.79s]  You're saying something about like marvel or something. Oh, right right jumped by an evil boss. What is the great heal?
[19914.27s -> 19916.03s]  How much faith is great heal?
[19916.03s -> 19918.27s]  I might ask it for you might ask it back actually wait
[19918.27s -> 19921.55s]  I don't have a cat. I don't have one of the catalysts. I have no idea because my game says zero
[19921.87s -> 19930.59s]  I don't have a catalyst. I can't cast this spell can I I could give you one because I think this actually makes these enemies
[19931.37s -> 19935.42s]  Just completely trivial if you just cast seals with them. I have a dragon seal
[19939.26s -> 19945.60s]  It's like warming stone. I i've never done this or oh, no, I did I did get a dragon seal. Okay
[19947.64s -> 19950.59s]  Okay, so let me um
[19950.59s -> 19954.25s]  Drop a great heal because I might I might I might be
[19956.81s -> 19960.01s]  Just teleport just teleport back here i'm at the boss door
[19960.01s -> 19963.69s]  Why don't you come here because I if great heal might be able to kill this guy in like five hits
[19965.40s -> 19970.22s]  Okay, so why don't you come here and get it because I have to I have to attune it i'm locking back
[19970.30s -> 19975.16s]  No, no, no, no, let's let's just we're fine. Okay. I want to hear that marvel thought
[19976.65s -> 19982.01s]  Marvel versus capcom 2 is so fast that it's almost hard for me to even pay attention to what's happening
[19982.89s -> 19987.77s]  And I feel like the you know what i'm not a big fan of at the soul cali. I don't think so caliber has this
[19988.25s -> 19990.25s]  I'm not a big fan of the
[19990.57s -> 19996.17s]  Zoom the camera in to show like here we go something's happening. I wanted to see what's going on
[19996.73s -> 20001.53s]  Like the here comes a move ring and we go zoom in really close and zoom out. I I want to see the whole plane
[20002.49s -> 20008.14s]  I mean it it it zooms in when you guys stand closer to each other if that's what you're talking about
[20009.66s -> 20011.66s]  How close do I have to be for this?
[20018.16s -> 20019.52s]  what
[20019.52s -> 20021.52s]  This thing that fucking doesn't even work
[20024.43s -> 20030.19s]  He fucking comboed me man, this is not where urgent heal is not an aoe
[20030.83s -> 20036.75s]  Okay, oh, okay supers in marvel where it like yes you go into like super and it like changes the whole screen
[20037.60s -> 20039.36s]  Yeah, it's like
[20039.36s -> 20042.08s]  The camera goes like a close-up of their face or they're you know doing something
[20042.48s -> 20045.04s]  Sometimes I think it doesn't hold another scene off camera
[20046.00s -> 20052.49s]  I actually also hate those the new soul caliber does it and I hate them. I I wouldn't say I hate it
[20052.57s -> 20058.28s]  I just I just not it's it's unnecessary to me. I agree that like I would rather it be
[20058.28s -> 20065.72s]  Like an in-game attack rather than like a cinematic drop a great heal on the ground so I can um
[20066.12s -> 20069.00s]  Equip it later when we die in it literally 10 seconds
[20073.82s -> 20082.75s]  Uh-oh, he's gone. I'm not what am I not dropping it on my screen? You're running in place
[20088.19s -> 20090.19s]  So will this let me see
[20090.75s -> 20099.92s]  No, it's a oh, okay. Yeah. No, no, I'm going back this this this should do it. I waste time. I'll be right back
[20102.52s -> 20107.07s]  Uh
[20107.07s -> 20114.62s]  It is an aoe
[20114.62s -> 20117.90s]  The thing is I like watching people play those games
[20117.98s -> 20123.72s]  I think it's cool because when they when people do their combos and you get it looks like it takes a lot of
[20124.50s -> 20128.00s]  Interesting skill set to do that
[20128.00s -> 20141.72s]  I will never be able to have and it's just fun to kind of watch people that know what they're doing flight get mana
[20143.05s -> 20144.49s]  I'm a big uh
[20144.49s -> 20146.49s]  big soul caliber
[20147.26s -> 20150.32s]  Enthusiast so even that like there's like barely any combos
[20151.12s -> 20157.02s]  I hate games where it's like 16 hit combo from corner to corner, but even that they've I don't know
[20157.18s -> 20159.18s]  It's gotten worse with that over time as well
[20159.74s -> 20162.22s]  How close do I have to be to use this? Does it matter where I am?
[20166.01s -> 20167.45s]  Holy shit
[20167.45s -> 20172.73s]  Jesus. Oh my god. Oh my god. That scared me. It was so ridiculous. Uh, you died
[20174.49s -> 20177.21s]  Okay, so that all right, so I don't have any more mana but
[20178.01s -> 20180.01s]  Uh, I will if we don't beat it
[20189.12s -> 20195.36s]  Oh my god, let me just drink for a second
[20198.88s -> 20203.12s]  It's I feel like i'm playing a fighting game against somebody I was doing comedy i'm sorry
[20212.03s -> 20214.43s]  All right. Yeah, i'm so glad we can kill this guy in two seconds now
[20216.54s -> 20221.47s]  Okay, we're good. Um
[20222.32s -> 20226.49s]  Pass that shit to me. All right. No, you're you have faith, right? Yeah
[20226.57s -> 20229.53s]  What do you mean pass that to you? You you want to be the one that does it?
[20230.96s -> 20240.70s]  Yo pass that shit to me dog. No, this is mine. I'm doing it. All right, let's go
[20240.94s -> 20246.64s]  That's like the most compelling argument i've had to like switch to faith and do the healing fire stuff
[20246.64s -> 20250.88s]  I was talking about just to just get rid of that enemy just delete that enemy from the whole game. Whenever you see it
[20251.36s -> 20253.98s]  Yep. Yeah
[20253.98s -> 20261.28s]  You're losing focus because the mask
[20261.52s -> 20269.79s]  That's good to know
[20269.79s -> 20272.03s]  That sound was so loud too. It was like he got hit
[20272.67s -> 20275.31s]  by a hundred damage abilities in a row
[20276.35s -> 20278.35s]  Not by one singular ability
[20284.51s -> 20295.34s]  I'll defend you my lord. All right, here we go drink
[20301.85s -> 20303.93s]  Wow, I never knew that either that's silly
[20304.57s -> 20305.53s]  I am
[20305.53s -> 20307.53s]  Silly shit. What's amber drought?
[20308.27s -> 20324.51s]  Draught what is this? I've never seen that item. Oh, it's uh, it's the like puppet guy
[20325.15s -> 20327.15s]  Oh, can you give me that carrion knight sword?
[20327.63s -> 20329.31s]  Did you? Yeah
[20329.31s -> 20331.00s]  Okay, i'm
[20331.00s -> 20333.00s]  Not of this reality
[20333.00s -> 20336.76s]  Okay, so you did mention you said hey man, I really want those spells
[20337.72s -> 20342.20s]  You it's 15 faith to use great heal. Are you actually going to put like five points in faith?
[20344.22s -> 20350.19s]  Are you going to yeah, I have to take it off at the bonfire
[20362.46s -> 20369.36s]  Like I from the beginning. I just want it like carrion great sword or something. I think there's a lot of souls
[20371.13s -> 20379.82s]  But uh, nobody's finding it. Do you want them both? I'm imagining you probably do sure
[20380.22s -> 20385.72s]  I'm gonna give you this other thing too. It's just like frenzy. It's a ton of faith
[20385.72s -> 20386.76s]  You're probably never gonna use it
[20386.76s -> 20401.48s]  But your spell guy and it was great heel was the one that hit him great hill is the aoe. Yeah
[20404.30s -> 20417.40s]  Urgent heal I think is just a heals you I think. All right, where are we going? We killed radon. I think the next logical place
[20418.28s -> 20419.32s]  is
[20419.32s -> 20429.44s]  Plateau there's not any major bosses that like is before plateau. Um
[20433.98s -> 20435.26s]  Um
[20435.26s -> 20440.54s]  We're not are you getting runes? Wait, what about the great runes? The great runes are also
[20441.34s -> 20443.26s]  Random so oh
[20443.26s -> 20445.50s]  Is that gonna lock us out of being able to beat the game?
[20447.00s -> 20452.68s]  Potentially, but the merchants do sell hints to like where some items are and if we really need to look there's like a spoiler file
[20452.76s -> 20454.76s]  That'll tell you where great runs can be found
[20454.92s -> 20461.32s]  But I think we could go tries to put them in places where you'll probably find them. Uh
[20462.46s -> 20474.57s]  Knock around is apparently the next logical step so underground or see the plateau go through the capital
[20476.38s -> 20483.32s]  Volcano manor is another one too. Yep up in the mountains. I feel like there's a lot of bosses up in the mountains, too
[20483.88s -> 20488.86s]  Do you want to do the skip to volcano manor from
[20489.98s -> 20496.28s]  Cilia or wherever you know, I mean the oh that enemy is gonna be different. Never mind. We can't do it. Hmm
[20496.68s -> 20504.91s]  What's up to you? I I actually totally forget how you get to volcano manor without doing that
[20505.15s -> 20517.93s]  I wonder if they're on the map
[20517.93s -> 20524.25s]  Is it how do you get to volcano manor normally you have to get the invitation right to like go actually inside of it?
[20524.73s -> 20533.50s]  And do the how do you get to uh, what's his name? Uh, the snake guy rykart rykart. Yeah, you need
[20535.04s -> 20540.48s]  Like walk all the way up the mountain on the it's it's a long travel on plateau
[20541.24s -> 20549.77s]  My toe platy platypus from where you fought the fire giant. Yeah, the mod kept in the volcano skip
[20550.17s -> 20552.38s]  you can go without the
[20552.38s -> 20568.20s]  Wait, it does someone said that i'm gonna give you the uh, quarterback seat here because i'll do anything just probably just looking at the map
[20568.52s -> 20579.66s]  Thinking if there's anything i'm forgetting. Let's just go to the plateau and the npc can tp you to volcano manor
[20579.74s -> 20601.58s]  Really, which waypoint is it to where we were you can still do the lucaria skip apparently. Oh
[20602.54s -> 20604.91s]  Rhea's in the lake. That's right
[20604.91s -> 20611.05s]  The the snake uh, the snake lizard kind of girl. She's in the lake and I think she can tp you there, right?
[20615.00s -> 20618.52s]  I don't know. Is that can we can we actually do that because we could we could just do that right now
[20621.71s -> 20631.15s]  I forget where she's sitting around somewhere here. Right? All right, go to um good place to go probably the
[20631.63s -> 20681.12s]  Laska ruins we'll go from there. Yeah, she's gonna be one of the gazebo buildings. Watch out giant. I'm not following you
[20681.84s -> 20684.89s]  She's in one of those
[20684.89s -> 20686.89s]  Oh, there's a basement here
[20687.40s -> 20702.89s]  Let's do it free shit. Can't go wrong there. Oh freezing grease
[20704.65s -> 20711.90s]  I can respect again or maybe you could because I just got a larval tier. Oh, I already I still have one
[20711.98s -> 20717.60s]  I think I have two
[20717.60s -> 20721.79s]  Uh, all right. You know what? Let's get the map here
[20723.93s -> 20727.74s]  Be much easier
[20727.82s -> 20733.39s]  Uh, why am I fighting this thing?
[20740.84s -> 20749.15s]  Where's the map? Where's the map? I want to freeze frame that you
[20749.95s -> 20766.51s]  Got like photoshop smudge tooled across my screen. What about the typing test? Oh, yeah, i'm kind of tired though
[20767.64s -> 20771.96s]  We need to do that like on a high energy start of the stream. I forgot to do that
[20773.26s -> 20775.74s]  I've been being reminded but like dude
[20776.38s -> 20778.38s]  I want to play elgin ring
[20778.54s -> 20780.99s]  Like like come on
[20780.99s -> 20783.87s]  Yeah, i'm with him. I'm with him now. It needs to be like a fresh day
[20784.67s -> 20788.27s]  You gotta be like fully ready. You gotta prepare. It's true. All right, where's this?
[20788.83s -> 20793.55s]  We need to go to follow me. We need I want the map. I hate looking at the no I got on
[20794.97s -> 20797.40s]  You know what? I mean, I don't like looking at the
[20797.46s -> 20805.87s]  Undiscovered area. I hate undiscovered area sister. I have to ask you this question
[20808.43s -> 20809.87s]  Hi
[20809.87s -> 20815.87s]  Hi, we planned on this. We planned on this weekend being an elden ring co-op stream weekend
[20817.07s -> 20824.65s]  But how do you feel are you you want to keep you want to beat this you want to try to beat the game on randomizer?
[20826.25s -> 20829.85s]  Uh, I mean, I thought i'm i'm still enjoying it. I okay
[20830.33s -> 20834.09s]  I don't know when would be good like when's good like when you want to play again
[20834.49s -> 20837.53s]  What's your schedule look like over the next like this week?
[20839.53s -> 20843.45s]  Weekend again or something just do it and have it be a weekend thing till we do we beat it
[20844.99s -> 20847.71s]  Or you know, you got stuff you got stuff going on on the weekend, right?
[20851.42s -> 20855.90s]  I think if you wanted to play again tomorrow, I could do that and then we could make it a weekend thing
[20856.22s -> 20862.22s]  I cannot play tomorrow. Okay, I think it would be the most responsible thing to do to make it a weekend thing
[20864.14s -> 20873.69s]  Same deal like saturday sunday. Yeah, that sounds good to me. Nice. Okay, so
[20875.96s -> 20883.63s]  Where is her gazebo? Is it this one? Is it this one? Is it this one chat? Give me help here
[20884.11s -> 20896.41s]  Where is her gazebo? They are never playing this again. Yes, we are bottom right this one here
[20897.21s -> 20898.41s]  Why would
[20898.41s -> 20904.25s]  Why would you doubt why doubt they are never doing this again? We're playing so much. We're like not going to the bathroom
[20904.33s -> 20908.48s]  And it's like nine hour streams. I'm like i'm gonna piss but this is fun
[20909.20s -> 20912.72s]  So fun there ain't ever fucking coming back never again
[20914.72s -> 20923.08s]  Uh, I think it's this one. It's the one next to the telescope. Oh, okay. It's this one
[20923.40s -> 20925.40s]  All right, all the way south. It's right next to the bonfire
[20937.31s -> 20943.92s]  Oh, I know I know an area I also would like to do is the uh, we have the waypoint to the underground
[20944.88s -> 20950.32s]  That one mine that we teleported to for the sleepy chest. Yeah, but we like never actually did the mine
[20950.64s -> 20954.22s]  There should be a lot of stuff in there and a boss at the end
[20955.24s -> 20957.77s]  All right. She's in here. Are you are you here with me? I'm
[20958.65s -> 20969.88s]  Not you should probably be here in case the host needs to do something. I'm coming. How far away are you?
[20970.84s -> 20973.21s]  Oh god, you're pretty far
[20976.17s -> 20977.21s]  Okay
[20977.21s -> 20978.81s]  My game crashed
[20978.81s -> 20981.13s]  Oh, no, i'm gonna get teleported out
[20983.05s -> 20987.21s]  I'm gonna not touch anything because I feel like i'm about to leave and it's gonna break the game if I do anything
[20996.80s -> 21019.34s]  Am I gonna get booted? Yes. This is seamless co-op also randomizers as well. Those are the only two things we have on is
[21020.54s -> 21035.47s]  Item randomizer enemy randomizer and seamless co-op. I'm inviting you to my game now
[21036.38s -> 21038.73s]  Thank you
[21038.73s -> 21044.43s]  Thank you
[21044.43s -> 21049.47s]  I did not switch to a faith build. I just put enough points into face so I could use this weapon
[21050.65s -> 21052.81s]  It's a strength weapon, but it is faith
[21053.37s -> 21055.37s]  Same time. I think if I find
[21055.85s -> 21057.85s]  a faith ash of war
[21057.85s -> 21059.85s]  That's like my sign to switch
[21060.44s -> 21063.72s]  Or if I find one of the spells I want it's my sign to not switch
[21064.44s -> 21066.68s]  That's like i'm waiting for either of those
[21067.16s -> 21077.24s]  The diablo style loot mod might be fun. Where am I?
[21078.94s -> 21081.37s]  Yeah, that does seem interesting
[21081.37s -> 21085.63s]  I wonder how elaborate it is. I looked into it and the answer is not very
[21086.19s -> 21089.48s]  No
[21089.48s -> 21091.48s]  Okay, uh, we need to go back down
[21092.12s -> 21094.12s]  Uh, oh it's right here. Okay
[21094.20s -> 21106.81s]  So what does it do? It kind of you pick up an item and it's oh long sword of the eagle and it's just random stats
[21106.81s -> 21113.15s]  On it. I think it's like preset to have ashes of war or like specific types of uh,
[21113.69s -> 21117.71s]  Enhancements on it and it could be like a plus one or whatever. It could just it's like just
[21120.11s -> 21122.67s]  It's read like it was just an extra layer to the randomizer
[21124.73s -> 21131.20s]  Why are you wearing the same clothes from your first playthrough? I don't know. I have
[21131.92s -> 21141.04s]  I don't just like wear shirts and then throw them away. I wash them and wear them again a
[21141.60s -> 21146.76s]  Week or so later. She wants us to go get her necklace back from a thug from a shack
[21148.11s -> 21153.63s]  Yeah, so we gotta go talk to the there's a guy that makes like, um shrimps or something over here. Oh lobster boy
[21154.73s -> 21160.25s]  Yes, let me do this too. What if we kill her?
[21161.16s -> 21165.88s]  That would be bad because that would probably break the game and the whole reason why we're doing this is to make sure we can
[21165.96s -> 21168.56s]  Get to the manor
[21168.56s -> 21176.92s]  Promptly, all right the shack if I remember this shack it's right here chat
[21178.11s -> 21180.11s]  They close in the game. Oh
[21180.51s -> 21188.81s]  Oh, I don't it's randomizer. I don't know. Is it down. It's right here, right? It's like right here
[21188.97s -> 21198.32s]  I think it's this one right here. Yeah, it's right here. I wasn't wearing this earlier. I had the blade
[21198.88s -> 21201.18s]  Helmet on I had this
[21201.66s -> 21212.03s]  Uh, I had this yeah, I looked much different this playthrough. You look cute. I think I think it looked pretty good
[21224.24s -> 21226.64s]  All right questions for stirrer. Did you ever come here?
[21228.40s -> 21232.91s]  No
[21232.91s -> 21239.15s]  Never came here. I have read I like knew all about the shack and what was here and it was like this place is like
[21239.15s -> 21241.15s]  It's all foggy. I never saw it
[21241.79s -> 21248.12s]  I think maybe once I like dedicated to coming here. I feel like you just beat all the bosses
[21248.44s -> 21250.44s]  You just kind of went boss to boss to boss
[21252.08s -> 21254.80s]  I didn't do a lot of the quest lines because they're all so convoluted
[21254.80s -> 21258.56s]  I did like ronnie's this is important like I never want to do that ever again
[21258.96s -> 21262.97s]  How do we not screw this up do we just like what give give me the necklace I forget
[21263.21s -> 21273.18s]  Well, how do we make sure we get to the manor? Well, he's selling an item and it is not a necklace
[21275.68s -> 21277.36s]  You need to ask him
[21277.36s -> 21284.06s]  And he you have to pay him. Yeah, and I go into the shop and he's trying to sell me a laughing smile mask. Okay
[21285.60s -> 21288.88s]  Shit rattling paint. Hello. Okay, I bought it
[21290.00s -> 21299.13s]  Hold on deal fuck
[21301.63s -> 21309.24s]  Okay, thanks for the smithing stone
[21309.32s -> 21311.92s]  I think we broke it
[21311.92s -> 21316.57s]  I mean he I bought I don't know. Does that technically count?
[21316.57s -> 21321.45s]  Does the the quest I don't I wonder if the game is like, oh you bought that thing from the guy
[21336.78s -> 21342.49s]  Kill him. Wait, kill him. He might have it on him, right? He won't have it on him. No, he won't
[21348.27s -> 21350.27s]  Hey, excuse me, sir
[21350.27s -> 21357.77s]  Sir, don't kill him people are freaking out. They're saying don't kill him. Do not kill him. Do not don't don't stir. No
[21357.93s -> 21360.68s]  Uh-oh
[21360.68s -> 21364.86s]  He's came fight. He hit me first. Don't touch my friend
[21365.82s -> 21368.62s]  Even though he's antagonized and he's completely at fault
[21372.27s -> 21374.27s]  Oh, and now you're gonna heal during a fight
[21376.83s -> 21379.32s]  I got plenty in mine
[21379.32s -> 21381.32s]  Oh, it's delicious
[21381.96s -> 21383.96s]  Wish you had more than one didn't you?
[21384.04s -> 21394.17s]  Why did you do that? That was mean. I got the iron ball. I yeah, it's not gonna
[21396.84s -> 21399.64s]  That wasn't I know. I look I participated but he
[21401.05s -> 21405.08s]  What was it? Come on. Is it worse to kill the guy?
[21405.32s -> 21410.36s]  I don't know. I think it drink elixirs over his body to show him like that. You would have lived
[21410.94s -> 21412.06s]  Here's the thing
[21412.06s -> 21418.30s]  But I think we needed that guy alive for for some very important reason. We don't need him. I did like a jokey
[21418.94s -> 21424.86s]  Like oh look, I'm doing a joke you killed the guy you started the fight and that ruined our playthrough
[21426.08s -> 21428.08s]  Our playthrough is ruined
[21428.40s -> 21433.40s]  I guess we're not going to play on weekends anymore. They were right. So what what do we do about this?
[21436.09s -> 21443.66s]  How about we get to the manor and they're like seven other ways that we can do it. All right, that sounds easy
[21444.88s -> 21450.38s]  Oh, wait, okay. I can't buy prawns. I can't buy the shrimps anymore. He doesn't sell them. Yes
[21450.38s -> 21454.86s]  He does. I just bought a bunch of them
[21454.86s -> 21458.22s]  I just bought a shitload of them. Oh my god. These things are amazing
[21458.86s -> 21461.90s]  Yes, he was look the other merchant
[21462.78s -> 21465.08s]  Boiled prawn. Oh
[21465.08s -> 21467.96s]  No, those are huge. I can't believe you
[21468.76s -> 21470.84s]  Killed that guy and taunted and
[21472.25s -> 21475.77s]  All the ball bearing we're good. God damn it, dude. Okay, so
[21477.68s -> 21478.62s]  that
[21478.62s -> 21497.08s]  Randomizer makes that way to do that impossible. So what if we just walk in grabs it better vote try talking to raya
[21497.08s -> 21503.28s]  Anyways, no, she's a snake spoilers
[21505.08s -> 21512.25s]  um, I played an entire playthrough with a snake and it was one of the most loyal one of the
[21513.43s -> 21519.26s]  Smartest and most fun had a lot of fun moments with that snake. What are you talking about?
[21519.66s -> 21524.46s]  I played through my first playthrough. I my first playthrough elder ring was was with the snake spirit summons
[21524.46s -> 21533.61s]  I summed them all the time. Okay, it was that's the you're talking about how raya is a
[21534.17s -> 21535.53s]  Was a snake
[21535.53s -> 21536.89s]  She's bad
[21536.89s -> 21539.37s]  Why is that? She's a bad type of snake
[21540.89s -> 21563.07s]  Okay, she can't be with the other snakes. There's a lot of smithing stones here. Holy shit just empty
[21564.03s -> 21570.56s]  We already got that i'm surprised you could open it again, but we already did that in mod chat. I got something
[21570.56s -> 21573.56s]  Here's the path to the manor
[21573.64s -> 21579.60s]  You gotta move around the mod mods are back seating like you like you were gonna get us there any quicker
[21579.84s -> 21588.20s]  Okay. Yeah, there's actually I have a mod gps here. Let me see if I can look at this in a map
[21588.68s -> 21592.76s]  I need to dude people were telling me the mod allows you to use the teleporter
[21593.24s -> 21597.24s]  Lady at the bottom of the thing with the we could just go that way if that's true
[21598.40s -> 21603.92s]  If you're that committed no, no, no, you're I think you're misunderstanding me like my mod like mod chat like my twitch mods
[21604.49s -> 21610.75s]  I know i'm saying something else. You're not understanding me. We just double miscommunicated with each other. Okay
[21611.66s -> 21618.81s]  No, just once and it was you just the one time you just you didn't understand. Oh, sorry about that
[21624.36s -> 21626.01s]  Is he high
[21626.01s -> 21642.06s]  No, i'm really not. I don't know why I keep doing that because the cave after you
[21644.09s -> 21648.25s]  Bottom of ray lucaria loop around there's a there's a maiden machine
[21649.93s -> 21651.05s]  Oh
[21651.05s -> 21654.89s]  Dude, that's right. I completely forgot about that. Hey, I got a better idea
[21655.13s -> 21660.64s]  I got a better idea. We are going to go. That's what I was saying you
[21663.15s -> 21669.39s]  What ray lucaria at the bottom of the thing you go into the machine and it takes you to the place and at first
[21669.47s -> 21671.55s]  I was like, let's do that and I was like wait, it's randomizer
[21671.55s -> 21674.11s]  We can't do that. The enemy will be different and you were like, oh
[21674.75s -> 21677.07s]  And then someone in my chat was like no in the mod
[21677.07s -> 21679.31s]  It's the same and I said that to you and you were like, oh, okay
[21679.31s -> 21688.24s]  So maybe we can do it. So what are we doing here? There's a fucking boss in the dungeon. Let's do it, bro
[21688.40s -> 21698.51s]  You're not even fucking listening. How come you never listen? I did listen. I just
[21699.07s -> 21700.67s]  I
[21700.67s -> 21704.27s]  I thought when you were saying that I thought you said that it wasn't possible
[21704.35s -> 21705.95s]  So I was like, okay, it's not possible
[21705.95s -> 21709.79s]  Then when we were told it was possible in my mind, it was like why are what are we doing here?
[21710.11s -> 21715.64s]  I thought you were trying to find something here that was like I thought you were abandoning the manor like ah, no
[21715.64s -> 21720.09s]  No, let's fuck that. Let's just do something else. I just want to do this
[21720.97s -> 21724.57s]  I thought but I thought you were abandoning like us going to the manor like nah fucking whatever
[21724.57s -> 21730.67s]  We can't go there. Oh, maybe we can but we can't where was all this backseating from your mods
[21731.31s -> 21736.28s]  When we were trying to find radon, uh, it was there. I just uh didn't look for an hour
[21738.41s -> 21746.01s]  Okay, i'm just being honest I I when I play dude when I play elden ring games that require focus or like don't get hit
[21746.89s -> 21750.49s]  It's it's i'm here and i'm only here and it's the only place that I am
[21750.97s -> 21755.29s]  It's also hilarious that you have like a mod chat and you call it your mod chat
[21755.37s -> 21758.41s]  But it's actually like can you guys tell me how to play this game chat?
[21758.57s -> 21760.73s]  No, no, it's not. No, it is not. No, it's not
[21762.12s -> 21766.52s]  You're talking about one or two scenarios over the course of like 16 hours. We've been streaming this
[21767.31s -> 21771.55s]  I believe that a lot more scenarios have come up and you just don't talk about it like this whole time
[21771.55s -> 21775.79s]  You've been getting hey jeremy you forgot to you need to like upgrade you have a plus five somber stone
[21778.01s -> 21782.25s]  Well, you know and you just act like oh, yeah, but oh you don't you like don't bring up that it was from mod chat
[21783.13s -> 21786.17s]  He ignores us too sad face sad face
[21792.91s -> 21795.79s]  I'm in i'm here i'm in here right now
[21796.75s -> 21817.50s]  I can't
[21817.50s -> 21820.22s]  Did someone accuse you of not being here? Wait, what?
[21821.02s -> 21822.14s]  i'm just
[21822.14s -> 21827.90s]  I'm just saying i'm i'm in here i'm focusing here and if you said something I may not have heard it
[21827.90s -> 21830.38s]  I may have heard it in process. I'm here and i'm fighting
[21840.51s -> 21850.06s]  I hope I can give this to you because I think that's important. I thought that was in the game
[21850.46s -> 21853.18s]  What the fuck is that? There's a guy going to get you
[21854.14s -> 21863.08s]  I can't leave this now leave we're watching sopranos. You guys are always watching sopranos in the mod chat
[21863.08s -> 21864.60s]  Like what is this?
[21864.60s -> 21866.60s]  You guys are on the sopranos kick
[21866.68s -> 21868.68s]  Woke up this morning
[21872.70s -> 21874.16s]  Did you drop it
[21874.16s -> 21877.84s]  I can't it's bound now. Well, wasn't this a fun dungeon?
[21878.40s -> 21891.88s]  It was yeah, I like this place. Okay. What'd you do to my computer?
[21894.04s -> 21898.44s]  I hacked it when I gave you that dot net framework install. You're correct to avoid it
[21899.40s -> 21906.51s]  This is that's like a graphics card artifacting or it's a secret area and that's fucking cool
[21911.56s -> 21917.69s]  That's the graphical error a secret area. Mm-hmm. All right, so let's do the thing we were gonna do
[21918.25s -> 21923.21s]  The thing that I was not ignoring you about the thing that I just miscommunicated to myself in my own head
[21923.69s -> 21928.33s]  That I thought we were abandoning that mission. I looked over at mod chat watching the sopranos
[21928.49s -> 21945.36s]  Nobody wants to fucking help me. Did they get to the part where tony hits the gas tank? I don't know
[21946.12s -> 21968.56s]  Uh, it failed that's from oh, oh, yeah, you're right. I fucked up. Oh, that's right. I forgot that's from when we were
[21969.60s -> 21977.64s]  Was it dead by daylight? Um
[21979.15s -> 21983.64s]  Dying light too. Yeah, I picked the wrong one. We got a classroom
[21995.47s -> 21997.79s]  Not dead by daylight. Sorry dead light
[21998.43s -> 22006.57s]  Daylight dead by daylight dead dead light dying light dead light rising rising light over light
[22013.15s -> 22029.61s]  Fucking game crashed. Okay. Um, i'm coming back
[22029.93s -> 22043.36s]  We're getting extra crashes today
[22043.36s -> 22046.64s]  Is it because we're going deeper into the game and there's more places for errors?
[22047.69s -> 22051.77s]  I have no idea and it feels about the same to me
[22052.01s -> 22086.01s]  I feel like i've crashed a lot more today than yesterday. Come on, please open open, please dude
[22086.01s -> 22105.29s]  You can buy spider-man and fortnight man. Cool spider-man one two or three. I don't know. I
[22105.93s -> 22108.89s]  We I need to win the wrong spot. Where are you?
[22109.29s -> 22113.31s]  I
[22113.31s -> 22118.43s]  Matter doesn't it pull sometimes it pulls me right? Does it pull me where you are?
[22119.08s -> 22124.36s]  Yeah, I feel like sometimes it's not done that it puts me somewhere
[22125.88s -> 22133.79s]  Has it always done that
[22133.79s -> 22138.91s]  Maybe it's because it uh, no, it just like puts me in like a weird spot near you, right? We used to try and
[22140.64s -> 22143.92s]  Be in the same location, but then I realized it didn't matter. Okay
[22146.17s -> 22148.33s]  All right, so we have to get to the very bottom of this shit
[22148.89s -> 22159.85s]  I'm going down. You didn't even do it like a chad like I did
[22160.75s -> 22162.75s]  Oh, you're such a chad
[22164.20s -> 22166.20s]  You're such a chad
[22169.47s -> 22171.96s]  Want to jump off in the midway?
[22171.96s -> 22175.40s]  Uh, i'm jump i'm jumping you're gonna go. Are you doing it?
[22179.64s -> 22182.84s]  Yeah, because over here you get the uh, the secret ingredient
[22189.50s -> 22192.46s]  Oh my god, this is a horrible spot right now
[22193.72s -> 22194.92s]  careful
[22194.92s -> 22196.60s]  I've missed me got
[22196.60s -> 22198.52s]  I got some soft cotton
[22198.52s -> 22207.28s]  Am I dead?
[22207.28s -> 22212.16s]  Oh, I had animation priority. You didn't whose idea was this
[22213.96s -> 22217.77s]  I'm actually really glad we came over here because it's legendary here for me at least
[22227.82s -> 22231.34s]  This actually is something you might want. I know they nerfed it but still
[22232.06s -> 22234.30s]  Spaghetti it's the sword of night and flame
[22235.84s -> 22237.84s]  I do want that you probably want this
[22238.72s -> 22242.38s]  If I were stir, I would probably say give that to me immediately
[22243.02s -> 22253.76s]  I do believe they nerfed it like into the ground though. I feel like I used it
[22254.78s -> 22255.74s]  in a
[22255.74s -> 22257.66s]  Run that I did off stream
[22257.66s -> 22259.58s]  And it was still pretty good
[22271.61s -> 22273.61s]  All right. Is this thing actually down here?
[22280.35s -> 22281.95s]  So what happens if
[22281.95s -> 22290.97s]  It's not down here. It's just an it's just an omega bird
[22295.52s -> 22297.96s]  Let wait, let it kill you
[22297.96s -> 22299.96s]  Wait, wait, wait, let it kill you
[22301.04s -> 22304.09s]  Let it kill you. All right, i'm gonna die here
[22304.73s -> 22306.73s]  Let's see what happens. Don't kill this
[22308.60s -> 22316.83s]  Still saying exile
[22316.83s -> 22318.83s]  Can you like take it? I don't know like punch it
[22319.63s -> 22322.27s]  Oh, it's gonna kill you apparently it doesn't care about me
[22323.15s -> 22334.65s]  I feel like this thing kills me so fast and now I just can't it won't hurt me
[22338.56s -> 22340.56s]  I didn't know that there was more to this area
[22341.32s -> 22343.56s]  He's crushed me in the head over and over again
[22348.51s -> 22350.35s]  Okay
[22350.35s -> 22355.72s]  Did it work?
[22355.72s -> 22359.08s]  All right
[22359.08s -> 22363.44s]  I
[22363.44s -> 22365.12s]  It works
[22365.12s -> 22367.04s]  Let it let it kill you
[22367.04s -> 22369.04s]  Really it actually works
[22371.72s -> 22375.80s]  You just have to die in that area. I guess if the game doesn't really care what kills you
[22378.24s -> 22381.84s]  I lost 17 000 souls. I did but it's worth it because we get to be here
[22382.65s -> 22386.41s]  That's it's not a lot anymore. No, i'm i'm i'm a verb
[22386.97s -> 22388.97s]  A little 72. It's not like i'm
[22389.36s -> 22390.65s]  level like
[22390.65s -> 22395.92s]  40 or something
[22395.92s -> 22399.20s]  I don't mean to like brag or anything, but it's killing me way quicker
[22406.17s -> 22408.64s]  Never mind
[22408.64s -> 22411.76s]  I'm watching you get hit by it, but you haven't been hit in a while
[22412.56s -> 22414.56s]  How are you watching me get hit by it if you teleport it?
[22415.48s -> 22417.08s]  Because you just got hit
[22417.08s -> 22419.90s]  Uh, you just got hit again
[22419.96s -> 22422.22s]  291 damage you can see my you can see the hit points
[22422.54s -> 22423.66s]  I
[22423.66s -> 22427.58s]  I can see your character dying and getting hurt but you're not you're like floating up here
[22437.36s -> 22438.24s]  Hey
[22438.24s -> 22447.10s]  There is the light I can now there's like shadows now. I couldn't see anything before really we're in the manor
[22449.34s -> 22451.10s]  I actually liked this place
[22451.10s -> 22456.44s]  That was cool
[22456.44s -> 22463.37s]  But I mean it makes sense. My element is fire. So I mean, of course, of course i'm gonna like this place
[22465.93s -> 22469.39s]  Um, i'm more of a wind
[22469.39s -> 22470.83s]  Whoa
[22470.83s -> 22473.26s]  That that's a rare item
[22473.26s -> 22475.26s]  You need to do a full quest to get that shit
[22488.28s -> 22492.44s]  Yeah, every time like I hit a wall you also then follow me in hitting the wall
[22496.83s -> 22507.10s]  I don't like it
[22507.10s -> 22510.54s]  Yeah, my my element is fire. My herb is tumeric
[22512.48s -> 22513.52s]  and
[22513.52s -> 22515.52s]  my animal is
[22515.92s -> 22517.92s]  How do you determine your herb?
[22518.97s -> 22523.29s]  What everyone you like the most the one you like the tumeric is your favorite herb
[22528.19s -> 22535.07s]  Okay, so why would you why did you laugh that made it really weird
[22535.87s -> 22539.96s]  Because i'm looking i'm laughing with somebody said in chat
[22542.11s -> 22547.63s]  Somebody somebody wrote like your favorite herb with a question mark like it was just like what is that supposed to mean?
[22547.71s -> 22549.23s]  It was uh, it was funny
[22549.23s -> 22551.40s]  Okay, uh, did you come? Okay?
[22551.88s -> 22553.88s]  A little we're a little desynced
[22554.33s -> 22555.45s]  We're good
[22555.45s -> 22557.45s]  You made like a bridge of people
[22557.77s -> 22559.77s]  Yeah, you just walk right over them
[22577.69s -> 22592.44s]  Oh some fun enemies, what what? Yeah, there's some desyncing going on
[22593.00s -> 22595.00s]  There likely is
[22595.16s -> 22609.08s]  The boss down here is what is it normally? Is it one of those winged magma lizard? How is it?
[22619.93s -> 22621.93s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[22622.25s -> 22627.21s]  I'm doing it on purpose. Not I just I was gonna I was also doing on purpose like see if you would do it
[22627.29s -> 22630.17s]  So we're like double downing double getting each other
[22630.25s -> 22630.65s]  Yeah
[22630.65s -> 22634.81s]  You were trying to bait me to do it and I was trying to yeah
[22634.81s -> 22640.41s]  But I was trying to make you think that you were baiting me into doing it thus i'm the one that wins
[22641.29s -> 22643.85s]  There's a winner in this situation. Yes, and it's me
[22644.57s -> 22649.95s]  It's so crazy how he won there
[22650.11s -> 22681.31s]  I was right card gonna work. What do you mean? I mean, we might still have to hit it with the spear
[22682.03s -> 22686.91s]  We also might not I think uh, I think randomizer does obey the spear rule
[22686.99s -> 22690.99s]  And it's just anything in that room that room the boss needs to be hit by the spear
[22692.14s -> 22711.79s]  Okay
[22711.87s -> 22716.41s]  Shield crash
[22716.41s -> 22718.01s]  That's a fun ability
[22718.01s -> 22720.80s]  I don't think i've ever seen it before
[22720.80s -> 22723.20s]  You get that with like there's the big spike tower shield
[22724.32s -> 22726.88s]  I was really I was really trying to make it work for a while
[22727.60s -> 22731.87s]  Are you one of those people that try to do a shield build where you just put two shields on?
[22733.13s -> 22753.12s]  I mean everyone's like tried it. Thanks when we make it out of here
[22753.20s -> 22756.32s]  We're still gonna need to loop around the mountain to get inside the actual manor
[22757.53s -> 22759.53s]  That's right. Yeah, that's fine
[22759.77s -> 22763.55s]  It's a fun little jolly adventure amongst friends
[22764.19s -> 22767.34s]  A little bit like a little bit of gallivanting
[22768.12s -> 22770.12s]  Oh, you went her first there pal
[22770.97s -> 22772.97s]  Okay, how do you feel about cilantro?
[22773.29s -> 22779.02s]  everybody asked
[22779.02s -> 22783.18s]  Hey, why bother is kind of how I feel like like why?
[22784.14s -> 22787.13s]  it doesn't
[22787.13s -> 22789.13s]  I
[22789.13s -> 22793.53s]  I don't I don't even know how to i don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it
[22794.41s -> 22798.20s]  This is kind of a mess. I don't we're okay
[22798.84s -> 22800.68s]  Well, this is how it was designed
[22800.68s -> 22803.02s]  Right. It's not like this is out of the ordinary
[22803.88s -> 22808.52s]  Like oh my god, what a tiny little area. This is so ridiculous randomizer another this is like
[22808.60s -> 22811.72s]  Yeah, this is by design you fight this guy in a smaller area probably
[22812.52s -> 22816.32s]  you do
[22816.32s -> 22828.84s]  You actually do
[22828.84s -> 22830.84s]  He's gonna explode
[22857.53s -> 22858.65s]  Ooh
[22858.65s -> 22860.65s]  End it with a flashy move. Oh
[22865.24s -> 22875.28s]  Cracked pot ruin arc by gosh. We've done it
[22878.62s -> 22905.00s]  I know you're desyncing. I've discovered a lost grace over here
[22910.60s -> 22912.68s]  Now like 30 000 that's not happening for a while
[22925.29s -> 22934.35s]  uh, uh, okay, we need to go
[22936.08s -> 22940.00s]  Around the mount. Do you know where you're going because I do you do?
[22940.00s -> 22945.60s]  Okay, but I don't want to go where you're about to go and i'll give you one good reason
[22946.36s -> 22952.06s]  Why is that because there's usually the mariner boss up here and I want to fight it whatever it is
[22952.62s -> 22956.72s]  It's a good point
[22956.72s -> 22968.08s]  Right go north through the canyon and hug the left side. Yeah, he's he's just doing his own thing right now
[22983.28s -> 22988.08s]  Is this part of the fun of elgin ring just going on an adventure and not knowing what lies beyond
[22989.68s -> 22993.68s]  Right over here. There's a giant tree stalker man. Ooh, there is
[22994.64s -> 22997.90s]  Which one is it? Is it the it's the future one?
[22998.94s -> 23001.66s]  That's that's fun. This one actually it really sucks
[23004.72s -> 23017.71s]  Hit me with them. Oh, but you got a fire weapon
[23020.22s -> 23024.80s]  careful
[23024.80s -> 23026.80s]  Oh, you were born for this
[23027.92s -> 23031.04s]  Not if I get stomped on the ground before being able to stand up
[23031.76s -> 23056.81s]  Ah
[23056.81s -> 23058.81s]  Watch out
[23061.69s -> 23070.19s]  It trolled you with it
[23072.52s -> 23074.92s]  I had that and I feel bad that I died
[23074.92s -> 23078.28s]  I feel like a loser that I died but also you died like 10 minutes before me
[23078.60s -> 23089.85s]  Sir, the boss had like 75 health remaining. We go again
[23090.57s -> 23097.18s]  Yes, oh the vibes weren't there vibes are there now
[23099.23s -> 23101.31s]  Yeah, they're really I was kind of like trolling
[23108.06s -> 23110.62s]  No, no shield
[23137.04s -> 23139.04s]  That really not do that much
[23143.23s -> 23183.44s]  Really not even worth doing that. It's like they're hearing my character go
[23187.12s -> 23214.68s]  I'm over it
[23214.68s -> 23220.46s]  No
[23220.46s -> 23222.46s]  Keep pounding your ass into the gravel
[23226.01s -> 23235.28s]  Get away from me
[23235.28s -> 23244.46s]  and again
[23244.46s -> 23250.83s]  And again
[23250.83s -> 23254.28s]  Ooh, that looks cool
[23254.28s -> 23261.36s]  Flashy end probably lasted that'd be worth probably a lot, right?
[23263.66s -> 23266.12s]  Yeah
[23266.12s -> 23279.20s]  I get love work. Okay. That was just the epic combat that I needed to get my blood flowing for our future adventures
[23279.92s -> 23284.28s]  What'd you eat today?
[23284.28s -> 23286.28s]  uh for breakfast I had
[23287.80s -> 23291.48s]  Uh, I had like italian sausages and I wrapped them in naan bread
[23292.60s -> 23294.36s]  Damn, that sounds good
[23294.36s -> 23296.59s]  It actually really was
[23296.59s -> 23298.67s]  Could I could go again? Did you like?
[23299.31s -> 23301.95s]  Peppers and onions or anything like that or just no just straight up
[23304.20s -> 23308.36s]  It was like in a hurry and I didn't have much food and I needed to eat before gym
[23308.76s -> 23310.76s]  So I was like, I don't I don't know
[23310.84s -> 23312.84s]  I'm going with what I got. That's not like
[23313.56s -> 23315.96s]  Like what you'd want to be eating before you go to the gym, but also
[23316.52s -> 23317.96s]  That is what I ate
[23317.96s -> 23321.80s]  Hey, there's nothing wrong with that
[23321.88s -> 23324.06s]  Do you like hummus?
[23324.06s -> 23328.14s]  I do. I'm a i'm a hummus liker. Yeah, because you mentioned naan bread
[23329.28s -> 23334.08s]  Naan bread, I've randomly tried it not that long ago and realized i've been missing out at first
[23334.16s -> 23337.76s]  I was like hummus is okay, and i've kind of had a lot of okay hummus
[23338.48s -> 23341.20s]  And then I got turned on to some like sriracha hummus
[23342.33s -> 23347.96s]  It's really good. Wait a minute
[23351.80s -> 23354.08s]  Run that by me one more time
[23354.08s -> 23356.08s]  Sriracha hummus was the keyword
[23358.32s -> 23360.52s]  Say the first word again
[23360.52s -> 23363.44s]  um
[23363.44s -> 23365.44s]  Say the first word you just said
[23365.77s -> 23369.40s]  I uh

[23382.52s -> 23387.92s]  Yeah, that's
[23387.92s -> 23390.76s]  That's how it's gonna be said
[23390.76s -> 23392.83s]  uh
[23392.83s -> 23396.20s]  Bro, I gotta go
[23396.20s -> 23398.76s]  I gotta go I got stuff to do later
[23400.44s -> 23402.12s]  Okay, i'm not sure if this is
[23402.12s -> 23404.75s]  Now i'm confused
[23404.75s -> 23406.75s]  I gotta I gotta I think I gotta go
[23407.61s -> 23408.57s]  Okay
[23408.57s -> 23411.07s]  Do you want to end here?
[23412.30s -> 23417.98s]  Do you actually like a sriracha? Oh you'd like a sriracha? I thought at first it was that I was pronouncing it so fucking bad
[23421.98s -> 23423.98s]  Jalapeno's
[23425.36s -> 23428.02s]  I'll take a jalapeno sriracha
[23429.76s -> 23433.76s]  I love sriracha. I i've actually like never had it at all, but I tried
[23435.10s -> 23437.10s]  The hummus and it's very good
[23438.14s -> 23441.18s]  And I have a local local streamer penta also
[23441.26s -> 23445.90s]  I told him I like that his eyes lit up like I have never seen a human being excited before to tell me how
[23445.90s -> 23449.34s]  Much he also loves the heb brand sriracha hummus
[23451.82s -> 23453.82s]  So I think i'm on to something
[23454.62s -> 23460.86s]  I just think sriracha just I think it just tastes like kind of just it's got like an odd flavor that I don't really like
[23464.19s -> 23470.83s]  It's just kind of like I I don't even know what like regular sriracha tastes like I feel like this hummus is probably like
[23471.39s -> 23482.40s]  It's probably not it. Hey, um, I have something you need to look at
[23482.88s -> 23484.88s]  Oh the meteorite staff. Yes
[23485.12s -> 23487.12s]  There's a bunch of snitches in my chat
[23488.40s -> 23489.95s]  Like
[23489.95s -> 23495.44s]  Like we'll get to it. I I would love it if I can also get a meteorite spell
[23495.92s -> 23498.56s]  You know, what's funny to me is I think they're doing that
[23499.12s -> 23504.88s]  Because I think that they're so concerned they're watching both streams and they see me pick up an item that you could use
[23505.28s -> 23509.12s]  And I think they think i'm just a dummy and i'm never going to tell you that I picked this up
[23509.12s -> 23510.16s]  It's going to be gone from my brain
[23510.16s -> 23512.88s]  So they're just spamming you to tell me to give this to you
[23513.72s -> 23521.66s]  Because they know that they could get your attention. So you'll tell me uh is on the ground right where i'm standing
[23521.90s -> 23525.28s]  I walked down to the bonfire
[23525.28s -> 23529.44s]  Stir just picked up a large club
[23530.25s -> 23536.20s]  I did how come nobody in my chat is telling me about this item that I would like every single time
[23536.20s -> 23538.20s]  There's like a strength weapon that's found you go
[23538.44s -> 23539.32s]  Look at this
[23539.32s -> 23543.48s]  And you walk around you swing it like twice and you're like maybe i'll upgrade that and then we never talk about it again
[23543.48s -> 23545.48s]  And then we keep using the weapon that you're using
[23546.64s -> 23549.28s]  I just like don't want to derail vr. Josh literally said it
[23549.52s -> 23552.72s]  Yeah, but I may have been looking over here you got remember for the streamer to see
[23553.71s -> 23557.39s]  What you're saying you have to do it for at least 20 to 30 seconds
[23558.20s -> 23561.40s]  Because if i'm looking over here and it's like club club club club club
[23561.48s -> 23565.64s]  Hey germa, did you pee your pants today poop poopoo? And i'm like, oh this it's gone. It's gone
[23565.72s -> 23571.24s]  I don't see it anymore. I look over and that's not it's not being talked about. Did you pee your pants? You poopoo, baby
[23573.48s -> 23580.48s]  Uh, no, i'm gonna stick with this. Yeah, I know it's not even like a cool large club
[23580.48s -> 23583.52s]  It's just like the most basic caveman wood club
[23584.48s -> 23586.48s]  It's kind of the character i'm playing though
[23587.60s -> 23589.60s]  It's like me strong supposed to be a caveman
[23591.52s -> 23596.32s]  It's the character you were supposed to play not the character you're playing and you were well we're well past that and it's fine
[23599.47s -> 23602.19s]  I mean you're supposed to be me smart and you're swinging around a sword
[23603.07s -> 23608.67s]  Uh an intelligence sword that has magic scaling on it. This is a huge club
[23609.21s -> 23615.32s]  Squished sideways and has fire on it. Okay, but like uh mom says you have to put it down
[23619.47s -> 23626.94s]  Poison get out. Oh, this is a fucking place where the goobs are
[23635.05s -> 23648.57s]  I'm going goob mode. Oh, we oh, okay. We're waiting for you to do that
[23649.21s -> 23658.97s]  Well, I might as well do it too. So you got poison resistance. Oh, I don't have the hat
[23659.13s -> 23661.93s]  I only have the I only have the body you want the whole thing
[23662.89s -> 23664.51s]  Yeah
[23664.51s -> 23668.19s]  I'll be the one who doesn't get poisoned down here. That's too bad because I like the way it looks
[23668.75s -> 23670.40s]  Okay
[23670.40s -> 23674.94s]  Yeah, you'll be back to the wolf
[23674.94s -> 23678.14s]  We look don't worry, but it makes sense. We we look like the two
[23678.78s -> 23686.76s]  Jokey dopey enemies in every like kid's cartoon like I got some ceiling wolves. It's like we drop on you. Watch out
[23688.28s -> 23693.76s]  Ceiling enemies in here. Look up like a bad guy over there. Oh, there is yeah
[23695.34s -> 23700.22s]  Supposed to be the goop. Why am I so always fucking dark here? It's because I rolled
[23701.02s -> 23705.04s]  Oh god, damn it
[23705.04s -> 23709.02s]  Don't roll. I forgot
[23709.02s -> 23712.01s]  Thanks for the starlight
[23712.01s -> 23715.53s]  Did you ever have the coke? Did you have coke starlight? Did you ever try it? It was really good
[23717.07s -> 23719.07s]  coke starlight after the fucking
[23719.95s -> 23723.34s]  The superhero
[23723.34s -> 23728.57s]  No, it was like coca cola cable was it was coke starlight. It was very good
[23729.13s -> 23734.41s]  I don't i'm not a coke. I'm not a coker. Are you
[23735.13s -> 23736.89s]  You're probably you
[23736.89s -> 23739.85s]  If you were to drink like a cola, would you was it like pepsi or?
[23740.65s -> 23742.97s]  If I were to drink a cola, I honestly wouldn't be
[23743.61s -> 23748.78s]  Okay, well here's something that you really want because this is one of my favorite abilities in the whole game
[23751.48s -> 23757.13s]  I genuinely mean that I love that move. It's like my favorite spell ice quag
[23757.61s -> 23762.57s]  Okay, that like ice glint stone kind of beam thing. They're like chew chew chew. That's probably my favorite spell
[23762.81s -> 23775.93s]  It's very fun. I just got a somber six. Uh-huh. What are you giggling at over there?
[23777.21s -> 23779.21s]  coke heads in chat fuming
[23780.11s -> 23782.75s]  I don't know the word coke heads kind of had me laughing
[23785.40s -> 23789.48s]  I used to be I used to not drink a lot of soda. Well, I drank a lot of soda before
[23790.28s -> 23791.85s]  but
[23791.85s -> 23794.33s]  Like in recent years elastic five years
[23794.89s -> 23798.33s]  I haven't really been drinking it that much. I'm not an enemy. I might look like one
[23800.03s -> 23801.15s]  um
[23801.15s -> 23805.00s]  But the little tiny little cans
[23805.48s -> 23814.48s]  They're like a nice little treat like a nice little dessert. I don't drink a full soda anymore
[23815.93s -> 23822.97s]  Kind of a little it kind of sits in me like a nice little dessert
[23824.22s -> 23828.27s]  I'm not too much of a carbonated man myself
[23830.11s -> 23835.32s]  Everyone smile, you know, you never really go for one. He's lying
[23840.28s -> 23842.28s]  Germa's lying. Why would he goes hard?
[23843.12s -> 23848.00s]  You've seen the cans I drink out of on stream. I've been you've seen them like over the last month or two
[23854.83s -> 23856.43s]  I didn't think that thing was dead
[23856.43s -> 23861.13s]  I thought it was gonna blow up. I kind of did too and i'm gonna die if I don't
[23861.69s -> 23868.14s]  Feel oh, that's right. I did try that weird milk and
[23869.10s -> 23872.78s]  It's supposed to be milk and pepsi, but um
[23873.82s -> 23875.90s]  This should this thing is probably good for you
[23879.56s -> 23881.69s]  Is it good for you?
[23881.69s -> 23887.69s]  Golden order seal. I'll take it. It's into and faith
[23888.41s -> 23897.87s]  So I think this it's fundamental, uh incantations. Yeah, i'll take it. I don't want to equip it
[23908.44s -> 23912.92s]  They discard really should not be right next to leave. I feel like it should be like two
[23913.48s -> 23922.44s]  Rungs down on the menu ladder. I feel like they should make the word delete but you know, where's that dlc?
[23923.00s -> 23931.24s]  Where's that dlc? Hey, look I was one of those people that said man no dlc. What's going on here?
[23932.78s -> 23934.72s]  Look at this game
[23934.72s -> 23940.06s]  This game already feels like it has 10 pieces of dlc on it. That is true
[23941.23s -> 23945.31s]  Like I feel like this if you told me that this game that I have here was like four dlcs were on it
[23951.87s -> 23954.03s]  You that is you're murdering them
[23954.67s -> 23960.33s]  This is very good here
[23960.33s -> 23962.33s]  But I kind of can't see
[23966.46s -> 23974.51s]  I got my guy. I got my guy. You got your guy
[23975.64s -> 23982.30s]  I mean i'm working on it
[23982.30s -> 23984.30s]  What is normally down here?
[23984.30s -> 23991.90s]  I feel like that's normally down here. Am I crazy or is that actually down here? I don't remember
[23998.01s -> 24000.01s]  It's two random bug guys
[24000.49s -> 24002.49s]  Oh, it's yeah with the oh
[24004.43s -> 24007.08s]  You know what I mean the bug guys bug guys
[24007.48s -> 24011.56s]  They're like the shrimp bugs and they have the things that porcupine things that
[24013.16s -> 24017.02s]  Clean rotten nights the game crashed. No
[24021.31s -> 24023.71s]  I think I think you crashed it when you made that noise
[24030.08s -> 24032.16s]  They confirm the dlc by saying they're not done with the game
[24032.56s -> 24032.80s]  Yeah
[24032.80s -> 24037.52s]  But they can take as much time as they want like like look at this fucking game like this so
[24038.24s -> 24048.35s]  We're so spoiled rotten by how this base game was I said it before finishing the first playthrough
[24049.15s -> 24051.42s]  But
[24051.42s -> 24054.06s]  I mean this game the how long did your first playthrough take?
[24054.06s -> 24056.46s]  I know you may have like skipped some optional stuff
[24056.46s -> 24061.92s]  But it took me more than 100 hours to just do the just play through it normally. I was like 120
[24062.08s -> 24072.52s]  Yeah, every other from software game took me somewhere between like 40 to 60 hours. I put my invitation down
[24079.59s -> 24094.17s]  150 took me 200 hours 50 hours, but I was google gaming
[24094.57s -> 24100.24s]  That's an interesting way to say google game. Maybe you just kind of followed a kind of a guide or something
[24102.03s -> 24111.45s]  Google google gaming. I like that actually I should take this off
[24122.46s -> 24125.34s]  My load's a little too heavy
[24125.34s -> 24131.63s]  Maybe maybe by a little i'm a bit of a baby boy
[24139.02s -> 24141.47s]  Still medium, right?
[24141.47s -> 24147.96s]  It's heavy
[24147.96s -> 24150.28s]  Heavy heavy heavy heavy medium
[24151.16s -> 24155.52s]  I have lipstick
[24155.52s -> 24157.52s]  Now i'm pretty cool looking
[24157.52s -> 24162.81s]  Let's continue
[24162.81s -> 24171.79s]  All right, do I have a headache from that green screen car game?
[24174.30s -> 24176.06s]  from like a like a
[24176.06s -> 24178.06s]  Like five days ago
[24178.14s -> 24183.39s]  Hey, just because it was five days ago doesn't mean he watched it five days ago. Oh, that's right
[24185.44s -> 24188.00s]  Yeah, the game was out of control
[24193.36s -> 24195.36s]  Maybe he has had a headache for five days
[24196.00s -> 24202.06s]  That fucking car game. Oh, no, it was backwards. Uh, we need to go north through this tunnel, right?
[24203.39s -> 24205.95s]  Right mod chat mod helpers
[24209.68s -> 24212.40s]  No, this can't be backwards because we're gonna pick that up
[24212.96s -> 24228.91s]  That's gary. Yeah, we're this right way. That's gary's castle. Whoa, take this too. This is another one of my favorite moves
[24229.39s -> 24232.59s]  We're just getting all my favorite spells
[24232.59s -> 24235.87s]  I was gonna say a second ago every single time you like find an item
[24235.95s -> 24239.39s]  You're like, uh, you're either this is one of my favorite spells or uh, isn't it?
[24239.39s -> 24240.11s]  Oh, hey, wait guys
[24240.11s -> 24242.11s]  Isn't this one like one of the most strong ones in the game?
[24244.33s -> 24248.65s]  Like every weapon is the strongest weapon in the game pick this up this thing's actually this thing i'm telling you it's good
[24249.21s -> 24254.35s]  This is a joke item. It's not a joke item. I'm telling you right now. That is I promise you
[24255.07s -> 24260.83s]  That's the uh, like i'll find fun. Thank you. Finally. Well, finally this is one of my favorites in the game
[24261.96s -> 24263.96s]  I've just won it like an actual sword
[24264.28s -> 24269.64s]  Sorcery like for the whole game dare you mock me in front of all of my
[24270.68s -> 24274.20s]  viewers
[24274.28s -> 24278.68s]  They held me in such high regard before you opened your mouth
[24282.94s -> 24287.61s]  That was a kind of i've never heard you do that voice before i'm a bit of a psycho
[24288.25s -> 24296.73s]  Now here's the real question will the actual super ultra
[24297.77s -> 24300.09s]  Comet ability beyond this guy
[24301.29s -> 24305.61s]  When we go do it over here, probably not
[24306.84s -> 24308.84s]  Sorry, wait, does that weapon count?
[24309.56s -> 24313.32s]  As an ice like a moon magic that is moon magic
[24315.02s -> 24317.13s]  It does count
[24317.13s -> 24321.21s]  I um, I should give this to you. Do you have that? Do you have the hat?
[24322.03s -> 24324.91s]  What hat? No, I don't well then take it. He's stirring
[24324.91s -> 24328.67s]  You're essentially gonna be playing the character I was playing as when I played through the game
[24329.66s -> 24331.66s]  I'm gonna switch on I need to respect
[24332.14s -> 24334.57s]  Uh, let me get it this thing
[24334.97s -> 24338.35s]  Boosts um sorceries, right? Yeah, it does
[24341.50s -> 24347.74s]  Yeah, you're slowly turning into the character. I I did that ice glint stone and this uh moon sword essentially the entire game
[24348.14s -> 24354.54s]  I like hate this hat. Do you want to do more damage or do you want to complain about how it looks on you?
[24356.62s -> 24360.19s]  I think I might complain. I really hate it
[24363.76s -> 24371.13s]  But is it worth losing like how much percent like 10 15 more damage? I think it might be more than that
[24371.37s -> 24378.89s]  I look like a fucking rug you can catch it rains. You'd be fine
[24384.28s -> 24391.42s]  This is a good hat, how is that? Okay you
[24392.22s -> 24394.78s]  It's the same hat just it's different
[24395.66s -> 24398.14s]  It's the same but different. It's the same hat that they
[24398.78s -> 24403.18s]  That's in the same world of hats that would be sold at the same store
[24403.18s -> 24408.92s]  The other one was in the the fucking the profile the shape the actual shape
[24409.08s -> 24413.32s]  Like how tall and droopy and lame you can't even see your eyes are covered
[24413.32s -> 24418.04s]  You're an anime character. You don't actually need functionality this one. You got a mask. You have full clear vision
[24418.36s -> 24421.56s]  It's definitely blocking your head from the sun and it doesn't go excessively high
[24421.56s -> 24435.20s]  It's just just enough to cover your head same hat. Oh, yeah, but does that one?
[24435.76s -> 24440.38s]  Oh hell, wait, hold on. Would that one make you punch the punch machine?
[24441.22s -> 24445.08s]  15 harder and get an even higher score as it's you still don't want it
[24445.56s -> 24448.28s]  I don't need a higher score because I already had the highest score of everyone
[24449.40s -> 24456.91s]  What if somebody comes over and beats it? It ain't gonna be you you better shut your mouth. You don't know that
[24459.69s -> 24467.34s]  I wasn't even fucking looking at the game get them get them guys. I was just like I was just seeing what was going on over here
[24467.66s -> 24473.44s]  Okay, what do you what? I don't what do you want me to do? I had 25,000 ruins, too
[24473.76s -> 24478.72s]  Here's what I want you to do. I want you to just pick whatever you feel like playing with and let's play
[24479.29s -> 24482.41s]  I just want you to fucking die. Did you rest?
[24483.29s -> 24488.59s]  No
[24488.59s -> 24492.27s]  Why don't you just fall over you got killed by a snowman?
[24492.99s -> 24494.99s]  It really is a snowman
[24506.40s -> 24512.40s]  There's a magma worm in the lava. There's a big lava pool somewhere where the manor is, right?
[24512.96s -> 24514.96s]  I wonder what's over there this time
[24516.30s -> 24519.82s]  Oh lava and more lava
[24520.54s -> 24528.20s]  This guy's really fucking pissing me off right now
[24535.63s -> 24537.84s]  That's a fake dragon
[24537.84s -> 24541.42s]  That is a fake dragon
[24541.42s -> 24542.30s]  Okay
[24542.30s -> 24547.42s]  So we need to hug the left wall. So we gotta go this way. That's what I was told specifically by
[24548.06s -> 24548.94s]  me
[24548.94s -> 24552.78s]  As I figured it up a good job on figuring this out
[24557.00s -> 24560.44s]  You have no right to talk shit about people's hats when you're wearing a cereal bowl on your head
[24566.94s -> 24569.98s]  I like all these hats. I'm saying they're all cool
[24571.36s -> 24573.36s]  Yeah, I was the one saying I didn't like a hat
[24573.84s -> 24579.85s]  So what's over here because there's a boss over here. Oh, it's a boat nice
[24584.81s -> 24588.73s]  Uh, that's gonna be interesting. Yeah, he's got a fucking lava boat
[24590.08s -> 24595.24s]  Okay, how long can the horse be in here? Um, actually kind of a decent amount of time
[24595.96s -> 24599.31s]  Yeah, lava does very little damage in this game
[24600.19s -> 24602.56s]  Oh god, that's a lot of guys
[24602.72s -> 24616.54s]  smithing stone five
[24616.62s -> 24622.48s]  Can we like convince him to move over here or something?
[24623.58s -> 24626.78s]  He wasn't moving
[24626.86s -> 24630.06s]  Try and convince him as you might as you may just stand over here
[24630.78s -> 24633.10s]  It probably slowly row over here it comes
[24637.37s -> 24640.09s]  Like a wheelchair you can't we're trying to trick him
[24641.58s -> 24644.38s]  You can't row over here. This is land
[24645.72s -> 24648.04s]  Oh, what did you boys want me to do over?
[24649.64s -> 24693.21s]  What are you doing over here don't splash me don't splash me he's going back in the fucking lava
[24716.11s -> 24720.11s]  I was I was actually respecting the lava on the ground and trying to not walk into it again
[24720.27s -> 24723.07s]  Oh, really? Sorry. I was like, oh yeah lava on the brain
[24723.87s -> 24726.32s]  not
[24726.32s -> 24729.04s]  That's my gamer brain my sleepy gamer brain
[24730.73s -> 24732.40s]  uh
[24732.40s -> 24736.40s]  Alexander is over there usually right at this point in the game. Well, we didn't do any of his quest but
[24738.83s -> 24746.44s]  I don't know. What is this area? Never heard of it. Is this elden ring?
[24747.58s -> 24749.58s]  Would alexander still be here?
[24750.73s -> 24752.73s]  No, I don't I think we actually have to do is um
[24754.25s -> 24756.43s]  You see him before this
[24756.43s -> 24759.74s]  Um, I think that was the smithing stone. I need it
[24760.14s -> 24765.58s]  I'm going to eat one of these for the first time I think ever in the hundreds of hours. I've played this game
[24766.22s -> 24768.22s]  The roa. Yeah the fruit
[24768.78s -> 24769.98s]  Where is it?
[24769.98s -> 24775.34s]  I don't even know what it looks like. Okay. Here it is. Wait
[24777.12s -> 24779.48s]  What's the thing that you feed to the horse?
[24779.48s -> 24783.45s]  Roa berry
[24783.45s -> 24788.17s]  You have to craft it. Oh shit. Okay. Oh, yeah, you do have to like craft it from those berries
[24797.72s -> 24799.48s]  Make it oh
[24799.48s -> 24802.36s]  I was like actually so nervous to hear that loud sound
[24803.16s -> 24815.26s]  How do you feel about the crafting in this game?
[24815.58s -> 24819.02s]  Uh, I feel like it did not need to be in the game. I feel like it is
[24820.14s -> 24822.22s]  It I don't think it matters at all
[24825.40s -> 24827.96s]  And not I it's it's upgrade time for me
[24828.68s -> 24830.52s]  I believe it is for me, too
[24830.52s -> 24835.60s]  Let's get a bonfire and go upgrade time. It's a really interesting
[24836.32s -> 24839.52s]  Mechanic to put in and it's just it's just more shit to do
[24840.24s -> 24843.84s]  It's just more fun stuff to do but I I haven't I don't really use it
[24843.92s -> 24846.24s]  I don't really some of the pot stuff is cool
[24846.64s -> 24852.08s]  Oh craft this craft some of the the grease and stuff, right? But for the most part I left it completely alone
[24853.60s -> 24857.92s]  Um, I just really feel like they're only useful in the areas where it's like this enemy
[24858.14s -> 24865.16s]  Insta dies if you throw this type of pot at it. Yeah, it's a great talisman for here
[24872.86s -> 24876.86s]  Yeah early on I tried to do like a bow playthrough and I got a whole bunch of poison arrows
[24877.02s -> 24879.34s]  I spent like 20 000 souls
[24880.22s -> 24882.54s]  Like early in the game to get a bunch of poison arrows
[24883.42s -> 24886.62s]  And I used 80% of them to kill like one mini boss
[24889.47s -> 24891.13s]  So
[24891.13s -> 24893.13s]  That's how I feel
[24893.13s -> 24896.73s]  Rom software really has had sort of a weird relationship with bows in all their games, haven't they?
[24898.52s -> 24903.64s]  They seem to want to make them cool and make them work, but it always seems that they're just not quite good enough
[24906.12s -> 24908.12s]  They need to commit to like a mana system
[24908.44s -> 24919.26s]  Instead of actually having to be consumables because otherwise you could you could have anywhere between one and like 9 000 arrows to use
[24919.82s -> 24928.54s]  Where magic is like limited? It does work as a kind of a secondary though
[24928.70s -> 24930.70s]  If you if you're already doing decks
[24931.02s -> 24937.02s]  And oh i'm gonna do like a bow a short bow with my off hand or something it it you can use it
[24937.34s -> 24943.29s]  But not as like a main weapon to play through the game with and like i'm going to use this and this is the weapon i'm using
[24943.93s -> 24949.85s]  But it's weird they they put up like every game they put a little bit more development into what bows are like there's like
[24949.93s -> 24955.05s]  Uh radon has like a great bow that has like a special bow effects in it and they're all just super bad
[24960.16s -> 24963.52s]  The great bows were actually kind of good in this game just for like knocking things down
[24966.35s -> 24970.51s]  Ali you still make it work though if you really wanted to
[24973.34s -> 24979.63s]  They even added all the the animations and the weapon arts and stuff, right? Yep. So, I mean, it's cool
[24980.89s -> 24982.49s]  It's it's a cool thing
[24982.49s -> 24990.54s]  Oh my goodness
[24990.54s -> 24992.54s]  This guy is just flailing around
[24995.29s -> 24996.17s]  uh
[24996.17s -> 24997.61s]  Do we miss a grace?
[24997.61s -> 25001.20s]  I don't think so. I think it's if we just ran further
[25001.92s -> 25006.32s]  I think there is a boss usually on this road. The um, the giant putrid slob
[25007.40s -> 25010.62s]  Would be up here
[25010.62s -> 25014.00s]  That is actually a great name for a boss. I'm about to respawn everything
[25014.96s -> 25017.14s]  I'm about to save that for myriad
[25017.86s -> 25019.86s]  the great putrid
[25020.74s -> 25027.54s]  I don't know the giant the great putrid slob, you know the great what did I say the great putrid slob?
[25027.94s -> 25039.30s]  That's a great name demihuman queen urn tree the great putrid slob
[25041.74s -> 25043.74s]  And his crab friend
[25047.49s -> 25049.49s]  You up here. I leveled up
[25050.40s -> 25056.64s]  What you what I I literally went to go level I have 50 000 souls man if I I don't want to die here
[25057.12s -> 25061.52s]  You think i'm gonna I got 50 000 souls. Do you think i need an update on what you're doing?
[25061.60s -> 25065.52s]  Yeah, you think we're gonna take on the great putrid slob without me leveling up once
[25066.66s -> 25068.26s]  What if I die?
[25068.26s -> 25072.29s]  Look at all this bullshit here
[25073.78s -> 25075.86s]  Look at all this. This is a fucking mess
[25076.98s -> 25078.98s]  he
[25078.98s -> 25080.90s]  Oh my god, come on
[25080.90s -> 25082.90s]  Yeah, having fun fighting it alone
[25084.50s -> 25087.94s]  I I mean I got I got squished in between everything but
[25088.58s -> 25091.65s]  Did you leave?
[25091.65s -> 25097.42s]  I was fighting stuff up on the hill. I just wanted to just do the big explosion and get it on camera
[25103.26s -> 25108.77s]  I'm not sitting down
[25109.49s -> 25111.49s]  The great putrid slob
[25114.38s -> 25141.30s]  Also known as the dung eater use your pistol
[25142.24s -> 25145.09s]  What?
[25145.09s -> 25148.05s]  Weren't you just like super excited that you found like an m16 or something?
[25149.01s -> 25150.21s]  I
[25150.21s -> 25158.06s]  Swear
[25158.06s -> 25160.78s]  Why is he following me around this house?
[25161.66s -> 25182.88s]  The word slob is I that's actually one of my favorite words. I think in the dictionary
[25183.68s -> 25185.68s]  Uh, you fucking slob
[25186.16s -> 25191.97s]  It has so much meaning but it's like so much force behind it
[25200.24s -> 25202.24s]  If somebody calls you a slob
[25203.20s -> 25209.22s]  It's like hey, whoa, dude, what the fuck? Come on. Like what do you mean? I'm a slob
[25210.72s -> 25214.24s]  I don't know. I feel like someone calls you a slob. It's like hey, you got me there
[25214.80s -> 25219.84s]  To me, that's like there's something I got to figure out why you just called me that like something disgusting is around me
[25220.00s -> 25222.00s]  Something is gross
[25222.98s -> 25227.78s]  Like I am disgusting you somehow for you to use the term slob
[25229.39s -> 25238.26s]  Well, yeah, that's why you're the great grotesque slob like if you had like a dirty room or something
[25238.34s -> 25242.10s]  Somebody came in and said hey clean your room. You fucking slob. It's like
[25243.86s -> 25245.06s]  Ow
[25245.06s -> 25247.06s]  It's a power word. That's hey
[25251.78s -> 25253.36s]  Okay
[25253.36s -> 25260.11s]  Come talk come talk over here. Let's see what you get. What the fuck is this?
[25265.22s -> 25267.38s]  I swear I played a lot of this game
[25268.75s -> 25270.75s]  It won't talk. What talk?
[25272.05s -> 25277.84s]  Wait, you have to bring something here. I got an item. What'd you get? I got a stone sword key
[25278.32s -> 25284.48s]  Yeah, that's not what is this like a rock normally what the this is this is where you get comet azure that like
[25285.60s -> 25291.50s]  The kamehameha thing you wanted. Oh, this is where you get azure, but that's not what you got
[25294.61s -> 25298.69s]  Okay, maybe it's just because it's dressed like a fucking wizard that I don't remember it
[25299.09s -> 25305.18s]  That's what it looks like in the game in the regular game. Is it? Yeah, I don't believe you
[25305.82s -> 25308.54s]  That is what it looks like in the game. That is the character
[25309.10s -> 25310.40s]  I don't believe
[25310.40s -> 25317.94s]  That's fine. You'll see it. Um, we'll see it whenever you play through this game for some reason like right like right now
[25318.02s -> 25320.02s]  Well, it is a wizard. This is a wizard
[25322.32s -> 25332.98s]  If you ask nicely, okay, please go to the road of the manor and upgrade my weapon. Yes, no vote in progress
[25334.30s -> 25336.05s]  It just failed
[25336.05s -> 25346.62s]  It was an epic fail
[25346.62s -> 25350.86s]  I'm gonna throw you a curveball here. I catch it. You're out
[25351.26s -> 25357.14s]  I'm uh, i'm getting kind of hungry and I think I think i'm getting close to being wanting to probably end stream
[25358.62s -> 25360.94s]  um, i'm content with your
[25362.13s -> 25365.94s]  Words that you're saying i'm content
[25366.66s -> 25374.96s]  How do you how do you feel about um, oh no, I need sevens not sixes. God damn it
[25375.04s -> 25380.06s]  Let's do so let's do our upgrades. Hey guys, I think so seven I might let's go find out
[25380.46s -> 25383.71s]  Wait, did we go to them? No, he's behind us
[25384.83s -> 25389.09s]  I've played this game before too. I promise. Uh, what do you need?
[25390.21s -> 25394.13s]  Smithing stone seven and normal. I think i've asked you this like six times. Yeah
[25395.20s -> 25396.80s]  No, I don't you all right
[25396.80s -> 25399.04s]  So yeah, but you keep asking me this question
[25399.44s -> 25402.32s]  But I can't be like stupid and follow you and hit the same wall that you did
[25405.25s -> 25417.17s]  No, you can be stupid. All right, i'm about to be really powerful. Let's see. Oh man. I need I need some souls
[25417.49s -> 25420.45s]  This this really is like a randomizer experience
[25420.61s -> 25426.24s]  I have a smithing stone two three four five six seven eight and an ancient smithing stone
[25426.32s -> 25430.88s]  I just I I just don't have seven. I know I said that I had seven but you're not listening to me
[25430.88s -> 25432.56s]  Anyway, no, no, I I hear you
[25432.56s -> 25438.32s]  I it is a it is a randomizer experience and it is very strange and need to pay attention to lots of weird things going on
[25438.82s -> 25443.30s]  Okay, so we're done. Well, not yet. I want to upgrade this
[25445.23s -> 25448.94s]  Okay, so i'm done. I think we can separate
[25449.68s -> 25453.54s]  Worlds because I think we're separating we can separate worlds
[25457.68s -> 25462.56s]  We didn't even do our we didn't we didn't even do our stand next to each other unequip our swords and do a wave
[25463.60s -> 25471.41s]  Idiot, you're the idiot. You're the one that said that we're done idiot. All right
[25471.57s -> 25474.93s]  Is there's been a lot of fun? Yeah, the last couple days have been
[25475.57s -> 25486.98s]  Really really fun. Uh, look forward to more so we'll see you as next next weekend saturday sunday elden ring
[25487.52s -> 25493.82s]  Randomizers till we beat the game. I think we'll do it in the next two. I I think we'll do it this coming weekend
[25493.82s -> 25495.10s]  I think we're gonna beat it this coming weekend
[25495.10s -> 25499.82s]  I do I think if we actually just fought final bosses we could do it in like a day
[25500.66s -> 25504.02s]  I don't think we need to rush that that I I don't want to rush i'm saying like
[25504.51s -> 25507.31s]  It just depends how much side content we do because there's a million of it
[25507.39s -> 25514.50s]  Yeah, I think for the next stream I might also actually do the faith respect. We'll see. Yeah, we will see
[25514.98s -> 25519.74s]  But wait, we'll see i'm gonna have to sleep on it. I'm gonna have to really deeply consider take it easy stir
[25519.98s -> 25526.08s]  Good to see you again. Uh, it's been a lot of fun. Seriously. Talk to you soon, man. Yep. See you. Yep
[25526.24s -> 25530.34s]  Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. Why am I getting in?
[25534.02s -> 25536.02s]  Wait, I didn't do this in my world
[25536.10s -> 25560.02s]  All right, okay, let me sell some stuff and we will go from there
[25568.53s -> 25573.81s]  Uh sell all right, I don't who cares about these rune arcs. We're not gonna get the ruins anyways, so who cares?
[25580.42s -> 25586.11s]  Oh, never gonna use these
[25589.79s -> 25598.43s]  I'm never gonna use this that thing is cool. What the hell am I never gonna use?
[25599.81s -> 25605.97s]  Never gonna use this. I'm just not going to just be honest. I'm probably never gonna use any of this stuff
[25605.97s -> 25620.75s]  I could sell everything here. Okay, here we go plus seven. This thing is very dangerous now. Awesome
[25621.98s -> 25629.34s]  B it goes to b it scales b and b faith and strength. I didn't know that so I should now because I have 40
[25630.74s -> 25632.58s]  I should be
[25632.58s -> 25634.58s]  I should be putting all my points into faith now
[25635.06s -> 25644.61s]  Because it'll scale double right? So that's gonna be cool. I didn't know that it did that. That's huge scaling on both
[25650.37s -> 25656.56s]  Yeah, but that's gonna be it. It's been a lot of fun. This is elden ring is i'm just glad to be playing it again
[25656.72s -> 25658.27s]  To be honest
[25658.27s -> 25662.86s]  Um, that's all there is to it, right?
[25662.86s -> 25667.42s]  I will see you guys the next time I see you i've got some stuff I need to do in the next few days
[25667.74s -> 25672.08s]  We'll probably do the same thing. We did this week, which is probably like a thursday
[25673.79s -> 25684.14s]  Thursday saturday sunday scenario. I think that worked out pretty well. That's what we'll do, but that's it. See you guys later
[25685.36s -> 25698.14s]  Take care of yourselves. Let me just exit here. Yeah, we'll do thursday saturday sunday
[25699.71s -> 25701.47s]  What we'll do on thursday?
[25701.47s -> 25708.14s]  That's a good question. We will figure that out over the next few days. Hope you had fun
[25710.74s -> 25716.30s]  Get some sleep. I know some of you was we were up late last night
[25717.26s -> 25723.36s]  And probably pretty late for some of you right now, too. Have a good rest of your weekend
[25723.44s -> 25731.81s]  Although there's not much left of it, but i'll see you later. I need to exit the game
