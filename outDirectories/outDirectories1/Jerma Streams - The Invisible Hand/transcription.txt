[6.97s -> 11.69s]  All right, I had to make a lemonade. I was really into a lemonade.
[12.25s -> 21.35s]  Let's come back here. Hello. How are you? Let me go this way.
[24.90s -> 27.38s]  Should be able to. Maybe not quite yet.
[30.82s -> 34.73s]  Hmm. Uh-oh. I can't get this to show up.
[37.06s -> 41.80s]  Hmm. Uh-oh.
[43.80s -> 57.30s]  Hold on. There we go. All right, cool. It's called the invisible hand.
[57.70s -> 61.88s]  It's a game where you sell buy and trade stocks. Fake stocks.
[62.36s -> 67.66s]  Nothing that you hear from now going forward is financial advice.
[68.98s -> 75.03s]  Nothing you hear me say until the stream ends is me telling you what to buy, what to sell.
[75.83s -> 79.03s]  Not at all. This is not financial advice.
[80.79s -> 88.60s]  None of ev- This is all made up bullshit. Okay, here we go. Remember we're 12.
[90.68s -> 92.68s]  Shortage of- Okay, I told you this would happen.
[93.70s -> 97.22s]  Shortage of wa- Wait, I'm already going? Don't even think about trying to bail. It's too late.
[97.22s -> 100.82s]  Shortage of water. Emergency taxation to save the unit dollar. What?
[100.82s -> 103.45s]  We're gonna ride this one out. Don't worry about it.
[103.45s -> 107.94s]  Should I buy? Why aren't you saying anything? Why are people screaming in the background?
[108.74s -> 114.15s]  Shortage of manpower. Wait, what? Oil gas down. Logging is up.
[114.15s -> 116.47s]  Don't pay attention to them. Pay attention to me. This is what you paid me for.
[116.47s -> 118.31s]  Have you dumped that mining position? Don't do it.
[119.03s -> 124.98s]  Liquidate everything. Wait, don't do it. Everybody shut the fuck up. I'm on the phone.
[124.98s -> 127.38s]  Don't panic. Just a lot of things happening at once.
[127.38s -> 129.38s]  Wait, it's turning around. I think it's turning around.
[131.43s -> 135.19s]  Hello? Is your terminal busted? Ours is spewing a ton of crazy shit,
[135.19s -> 138.66s]  but I have no idea if any of it's real. Buy? What am I buying?
[139.38s -> 143.14s]  Green groceries. Okay, I'm gonna buy short for- I don't even know what I'm looking at.
[144.39s -> 149.27s]  Daily ch- Liquidate everything now. Buy back 100%. Anyways, call me back if you hear anything from
[149.27s -> 154.41s]  it. Who has steel? Oh no, I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna answer the phone call from the Bogdanoff,
[154.41s -> 160.50s]  so you outta your fucking mind. Okay, buy back everything. The system is down.
[161.77s -> 167.98s]  Materials. Materials. Materials. Lobby. Congress? I don't- What do I have?
[167.98s -> 172.12s]  Is this like just the intro, right? Jake, let me ask him. Do you trust me?
[172.12s -> 175.98s]  Is everyone kind of counting? Dead? Did a bomb go off? I can't hear anything.
[175.98s -> 192.01s]  Oh, okay, this is- Oh, he bought? Downbeat.
[192.01s -> 201.06s]  Faireos. Okay, coffee, $4.90. As the screen behind me implies, welcome to Faireos.
[202.12s -> 205.32s]  You may have been surprised to hear from us following the recent crash, but I'm pleased to
[205.32s -> 211.48s]  confidently disclose that the bailout has come through. Needless to say, everybody involved in
[211.48s -> 217.32s]  that crisis has been held suitably responsible. They now work for our inferior competitors.
[217.32s -> 222.82s]  Because of this, we have an entry-level analyst position available. We've also had some complaints
[222.82s -> 228.09s]  in the past, so this is now a paid internship. Ordinarily, we wouldn't consider someone without
[228.09s -> 233.85s]  a traditional finance background, but you are recommended by an employee we consider trustworthy.
[233.85s -> 239.29s]  And they consider you trustworthy. As you know, trust is risk. Please act accordingly.
[239.29s -> 243.70s]  Before we proceed, the Trade and Investment Commission requires Faireos to subject all
[243.70s -> 248.07s]  potential hires to a questionnaire. Common sense implies that you know what the correct
[248.07s -> 253.42s]  answers to these questions are. Please input them as quickly as possible so we can move past this.
[253.42s -> 258.26s]  I doubt, with all sincerity, that anybody who takes longer than a few minutes to complete this
[258.26s -> 264.78s]  test is in any way suited to employment at this firm, okay? I know a lot about stocks.
[264.78s -> 269.18s]  I know about fucking selling. I know about buying. I know about calls. I know about puts.
[269.18s -> 273.02s]  I know about shorts. I know about longs. I could get every one of these questions right.
[277.43s -> 283.90s]  I know what the 10-year yield is. You don't? I do. Nobody else does but me. Additionally,
[283.90s -> 287.10s]  our public relations team has suggested that we volunteer to submit to an enhanced pass score
[287.10s -> 294.89s]  of 100% out of 80. More ethical. We've agreed on your behalf. The timer will begin as soon as
[294.89s -> 302.92s]  you press the begin test button. Okay, here we go. What is a covered call? Well, question one.
[302.92s -> 307.00s]  You are approached by a high net worth individual with a substantial capital gain
[307.00s -> 311.96s]  who explicitly states the desire to exempt it from all taxation in all jurisdictions.
[311.96s -> 316.81s]  Do you? Open the account and assure the client that your firm will be able to complete this
[316.81s -> 322.17s]  request. Open the account but inform the client that your firm will not be able to exempt them
[322.17s -> 327.13s]  from taxation unless they are willing to pay specialized fees directly to the firm and you.
[327.13s -> 331.74s]  Reject the account and report the stated intent of the client of the Trade and Investment
[331.74s -> 349.59s]  Commission. So he wants me to hide taxes? Capital gains taxes. Well, how many fees?
[349.59s -> 355.24s]  How would we even do this, by the way? To drop this person's capital gains, we'd have to lose
[355.24s -> 360.31s]  a bunch of money. If this person had a substantial capital gain for the year,
[360.31s -> 367.54s]  we'd have to lose a substantial amount of their fucking money. I mean, if that's what they want,
[367.54s -> 370.98s]  you're gonna pay a fee to me for me to like just buy a bunch of bullshit and lose it?
[370.98s -> 390.89s]  That's what you want? I failed the test. You're a fucking idiot. First question.
[392.23s -> 400.63s]  Hey, take this regulatory test. Do you want to do anything illegal? Yes. Okay, fucking leave.
[400.63s -> 406.87s]  All right, reject the account. Reject the account. A colleague invites you to join an insider trading
[406.87s -> 412.33s]  scheme involving a computer network in which investment profiles, professionals illegally
[412.33s -> 416.65s]  exchange privileged information. Do you accept the invitation to make full use of the network
[416.65s -> 421.29s]  to personally enrich yourself and your firm? Accept the invitation as a gesture of goodwill,
[421.29s -> 427.29s]  but do not make use of the network yourself or reject the invitation and immediately inform
[427.29s -> 433.22s]  the Trade and Investment Commission of this network. No, I'm gonna get fucking fired.
[433.22s -> 439.13s]  No, this is a question. This is an ethics question. A rumor about something like this ghost
[439.13s -> 443.85s]  network started years ago. TIC, probably, whatever. You are asked to invest on behalf
[443.85s -> 448.66s]  of your firm in an offshore company with self-evident connections to organized crime,
[448.66s -> 455.24s]  rogue states, and are individuals banned from securities trading? Do you? No, we're gonna
[455.24s -> 466.98s]  reject. We're gonna just hit the ones that are already selected. Yeah, okay. The Trade and
[466.98s -> 472.81s]  Investment Commission. Yeah, I know, but like it's fun to read. Yeah, all right, we're gonna do
[472.81s -> 478.09s]  everything legally. You apply for employment at a firm which expresses contempt for the regulations
[478.09s -> 481.77s]  and practices of the Trade and Investment Commission during the year. We perceive the
[481.77s -> 488.02s]  interview reporting any illegal activity. You discover that your firm has secretly been using
[488.02s -> 492.66s]  technology that enables a decisive advantage in trading efficiency. We utilize the technology
[492.66s -> 497.27s]  specified carefully, minding the boundaries of the current regulatory framework. You're eating at
[497.27s -> 500.47s]  your favorite restaurant when a local student appears and asks you to explain and define the
[500.47s -> 505.13s]  concept of fiduciary duty. You tell the student that it means responsibility for the interests
[505.13s -> 507.93s]  of your client within the legal requirements and your personal professional code of ethics,
[507.93s -> 510.65s]  except for where the admission code of ethics conflicts with legal requirements, in which case
[510.65s -> 519.29s]  those requirements must be fastedly preferred. Don't use criminal information. Wait. Formal
[519.29s -> 524.65s]  obligation for the Trade Commission. Don't take that money. If you've registered discrimination
[524.65s -> 527.21s]  on the basis of race, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, or another marriage
[527.21s -> 535.11s]  or relationship supervisor, refuse to undertake the illegal trading activity. I passed it. MNM is
[535.11s -> 544.47s]  scared to rap battle. Your company has submitted to the Trade and Investment Commission that they
[544.47s -> 548.47s]  have a values-based culture focused on the following. Accountability, customer-focused
[548.47s -> 552.07s]  diversity. How does this culture align with your deeply held personal beliefs and understand our
[552.07s -> 576.95s]  historical workplace practices? Please answer in a hundred words or less. That's a redditor joke.
[583.00s -> 588.01s]  You guys are pretty split on that one. You guys are pretty split on that one. Your company has
[588.01s -> 592.66s]  submitted to the Trade Commission their ideal employee supports innovation with a salary in
[592.66s -> 611.88s]  the top one percent of earners. What amount of cash would you pledge to a crowdfunding campaign?
[611.88s -> 622.65s]  Okay. So wait, if I had a hundred thousand, a hundred, a hundred grand for like a second
[622.65s -> 630.57s]  campaign, your ideal employee values community after depositing an annual bonus of $500,000,
[630.57s -> 634.65s]  what amount of cash would you distribute to a homeless individual who requested $10 as you
[634.65s -> 645.54s]  exited the bank? Well, you can't, I would not be able to give like a hundred thousand plus dollars
[645.54s -> 648.42s]  to somebody like in cash. They would be walking around. They would be like a target. I'm not going
[648.42s -> 670.76s]  to do that. Zero. Get out of here. I, maybe 500, 500. And then like, I don't know, finally get,
[670.76s -> 675.24s]  be like, Hey, how much would it take for you to like be in a hotel for like three weeks?
[675.24s -> 691.78s]  Maybe $500 cash. And then I put you up in a hotel for like a month, right? Like, yeah, right. What
[691.86s -> 701.00s]  do you mean? Yeah, right. Your company, Farias, has submitted to the trading mission that their
[701.00s -> 704.65s]  ideal employee believes in integrity. That's your primary motivation for wanting to help people
[704.65s -> 749.58s]  through working in the financial service industry. Um, it's my motivation. That's probably what I've
[749.58s -> 755.70s]  been wanting. That's, that's, that's pretty accurate. You're playing a stock market simulation
[755.70s -> 759.70s]  video game entitled the invisible hand with a range of difficulty options. What mode of difficulty
[759.70s -> 766.62s]  would you prefer? I want to play the game with story featuring the inability to be fired. Oh,
[766.62s -> 776.52s]  regular the way that they wanted it to be played. Congratulations. Your ability to correctly answer
[776.52s -> 781.16s]  these questions with little hesitation implies your clear understanding of their value. You'll
[781.16s -> 785.72s]  excuse me. I have another meeting. This exam is the only phase of our recruitment process in
[785.72s -> 791.30s]  which a company supervisor is legally required. The remainder of our procedure involves several
[791.30s -> 796.14s]  days of take-home work that you'll need to complete within 72 hours. I will email it to you shortly.
[796.70s -> 800.22s]  Unfortunately, we're not able to offer compensation for this take-home work.
[800.22s -> 804.63s]  So already making a substantial investment by reviewing your submission of it and someone
[804.63s -> 808.71s]  with a newly renewed sense of ethics. I'm sure you can agree. And anything else would be deeply
[808.71s -> 813.99s]  unfair to us. If selected for the position, you will receive an offer of employment in writing.
[813.99s -> 819.22s]  Barrios will only communicate with successful applicants. It was so wonderful to meet you with,
[819.22s -> 825.99s]  it was so wonderful to meet with you today. I really enjoyed it. Do not contact me with inquiries
[825.99s -> 835.13s]  regarding the status of your application. Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy. Only buy, never sell. Is that
[835.13s -> 861.29s]  what you want me to do? Use your keyboard to move around. Okay. You guys can't even hear anything.
[861.29s -> 870.98s]  That's better. Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. Meet in main lobby. Attendance is mandatory. Did I get the job?
[872.10s -> 876.90s]  Nice to meet you. I'm Morgan Lee. Seems like only one of us is going to end up with this job.
[876.90s -> 881.06s]  I tried to look you up on business link and a few other alumni networks, but I couldn't find
[881.06s -> 884.18s]  anything. That means you're either a big problem or no problem at all. Interesting.
[885.62s -> 892.50s]  Oh, look at all those stock tickers. Plastics are down. What are you?
[892.50s -> 905.40s]  What happened? What happened? We get down? There's a fire in the building.
[905.96s -> 929.42s]  10 o'clock. Meet in the main lobby. All right. What's that? Attack on Titan. I love that city.
[929.42s -> 935.98s]  It's just like an image. I love it. Do I have my own computer? What are you doing? What?
[936.86s -> 943.11s]  It's 10 a.m. Join us. Oh, shit. Sorry. Well, I've been here. Good morning to both of you. Welcome
[943.11s -> 947.83s]  to Furious and your first day as a probationary analyst. Looking for the right person to fill
[947.83s -> 951.99s]  this role. One of you is the wrong person. Either of you figured it out ahead of schedule. Fear
[951.99s -> 956.31s]  free to let me know. Otherwise, we'll let the results speak for themselves. Follow me.
[957.11s -> 972.94s]  This is intimidating. Even resources put the personal garbage you sent over into these boxes.
[972.94s -> 980.14s]  Like if I'm like if I like buy like a stock in my bed on my phone, you know what I mean?
[980.62s -> 985.90s]  And I just lose money on it. I don't care. Okay, whatever. But like if I have people to look
[985.90s -> 994.79s]  off my shoulder and see what I'm doing so we can grab, rotate, and throw. If it was up to me,
[994.79s -> 997.67s]  none of you would be allowed to have this kind of clutter on your desk in the first place. Somebody
[997.67s -> 1002.79s]  must have threatened a lawsuit. Organize at least. This place is a business place of business.
[1003.51s -> 1008.28s]  Does it really strike you as an appropriate time to go rifling through your pathetic box
[1008.28s -> 1014.41s]  of imaginary memories? I think I just got in trouble for doing that.
[1020.86s -> 1023.98s]  Somebody answer that phone. Because a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?
[1025.48s -> 1027.88s]  All right, somebody pick up that phone. I fucking hate it. It's freaking me out.
[1031.50s -> 1036.14s]  Where's my desk? Wait, is this my desk? I said I don't start working. Oh, it's not that phone.
[1036.14s -> 1041.64s]  Wrong phone. Okay, green grocers is up. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hello? Hey, how's your first
[1041.64s -> 1048.30s]  day going, pal? Don't pitch to me if Corbin scares the shit out of you. You wanted in, I got you in.
[1049.10s -> 1052.94s]  Who did they put you up against for your probation? Morgan Lee. Fuck. I was worried they
[1052.94s -> 1057.77s]  would do that. I'm not going to lie to you. You got basically no chance of beating her. She went
[1057.77s -> 1061.21s]  to all the right schools, took all the right classes. Unfortunately, she's too squeaky clean
[1061.21s -> 1068.74s]  to know all the right people like me. Where does this music come from? This is just the
[1068.74s -> 1074.26s]  Undertale bar music. I also don't appreciate them pissing on my recommendation by setting you up
[1074.26s -> 1080.34s]  to get fucked like this. I want to let you in on something. I have my guy give you access to Geist.
[1081.06s -> 1086.58s]  You should see it on there now. All right, GeistNet is a closed network made up of information
[1086.58s -> 1091.14s]  brokers and anonymous insiders. You don't know who they are. You don't need to know who they are.
[1091.14s -> 1096.12s]  They get taken care of. You're going to see information on Geist that goes against what you
[1096.12s -> 1101.56s]  see on trade feed, what you watch on in, what you hear from your friends and your family,
[1101.56s -> 1107.88s]  everything basically. Remember, what you see on Geist is the smart money. Not only is it the truth,
[1107.88s -> 1113.88s]  but we know it is before anyone else does. This is porn music. There's nothing wrong with the
[1113.88s -> 1118.84s]  information everybody gets on trade feed. And you'll need all of it as things pick up,
[1118.84s -> 1125.18s]  but Geist will always be the ace up your sleeve. All of it over the next few days, for example,
[1125.18s -> 1130.30s]  and you should be able to take down Lee easily. Nobody will ever tell her about it and she
[1130.30s -> 1136.38s]  wouldn't use it even if they did. Worry about getting dirty looks at the kombucha enema clinic.
[1136.38s -> 1139.74s]  You're scared of the money police, whatever. Not our problem.
[1140.46s -> 1144.74s]  Plus people at Ferrios know about Geist, but only a few people at Ferrios know about Geist.
[1145.70s -> 1148.58s]  Don't treat it like a topic of casual conversation. You'll be fine.
[1149.14s -> 1151.64s]  I brought you here because you didn't buckle under pressure at the old place.
[1152.36s -> 1155.72s]  And you weren't directly involved, but you could have talked. You didn't. That said,
[1155.72s -> 1160.12s]  if you don't want to be a part of this, you can walk away right now. But the moment you buy
[1160.12s -> 1165.08s]  dark roast coffee, when everybody else on that floor is selling it, that's the moment I'll know
[1165.08s -> 1171.74s]  where you stand. Really. And from there, my friend, the sky's the limit. I'll see you tonight.
[1171.74s -> 1180.01s]  Drinks are on me. Okay? Dark roast coffee secretly secures exclusivity contract with
[1180.01s -> 1184.01s]  Balcador's supplier. As scheduled for announcement later today, dark roast coffee has struck a deal
[1184.01s -> 1189.05s]  with a major farming concern in the Democratic Republic of Balcador to provide exclusive access
[1189.05s -> 1194.89s]  to future coffee bean harvests. The industry may take an overall hit, which is why most people are
[1194.89s -> 1198.57s]  selling, but insiders have been assured that shares will rise sharply once the news is made
[1198.57s -> 1208.01s]  public at 16 o'clock. Details about coffee are shown here. Companies that supply coffee will profit
[1208.01s -> 1214.55s]  from the price surge. Click on dark roast to continue. Use the buy button to buy some shares.
[1215.35s -> 1218.95s]  Use the arrow buttons to change the quantity of the money to spend.
[1219.67s -> 1227.43s]  Oh, I'm just buying. How much money do I have? Not enough cash. I'll take a fucking hundred
[1227.43s -> 1232.31s]  thousand. Details about your position are shown here. Keep an eye on the benefit slash deficit
[1232.31s -> 1237.85s]  and liquidate when it's highest. 670 right now. It's not even 16 o'clock.
[1238.57s -> 1246.38s]  Buy more of this. All right. What time is it? What time is it? What do we got for time?
[1247.02s -> 1251.46s]  16 o'clock. They're going to announce it. Wait, should I sell now and buy back in again?
[1252.02s -> 1257.06s]  All right. I'm going to sell. I'm going to liquidate everything and I'm going to buy back again when it
[1257.06s -> 1265.37s]  drops. I still have like three hours for this to happen. Sell everything right now. Sell everything.
[1266.09s -> 1276.06s]  Oh, wait, what? Oh, shows everything and it shows you a position in a single place.
[1276.70s -> 1280.92s]  Take a break. Get some coffee. The machine is in the back room. Use down key to lead the desk.
[1281.64s -> 1285.90s]  So as you know, I've received dividends when you're experienced enough. Okay, cool. All right. So
[1285.90s -> 1300.82s]  what's up? We got one more. One more, sir. Look at this going up. The announcement said 16. I bought
[1300.82s -> 1310.98s]  on the dip right there. Yeah. Look at this dip. Okay. All right. Hey, everyone's selling. Everyone's
[1310.98s -> 1317.42s]  selling. It's going to surge up to probably like at least 10%. I got plus 120,000 in revenue right
[1317.42s -> 1331.42s]  now. Here it comes. That's a huge volume. You have 13.7 dollars. Yeah. Well, in a minute, this is
[1331.42s -> 1335.82s]  going to skyrocket. I'm going to make a shitload of money. I'm down like 700 bucks, but it's okay.
[1337.98s -> 1344.57s]  We have insider information. Asher spent when buying long positions and acquired when taking.
[1344.57s -> 1354.62s]  Yeah. Okay. Here comes the announcement. Pepe left bear market. All right. Here it comes. Here it
[1354.62s -> 1371.59s]  comes. Here it comes. I'm ready. Here comes the announcement. I went all in. Okay. They just
[1371.59s -> 1376.70s]  announced it. Seven, eight. It's going crazy. 8.4, 8.8. We're going to sell at 10. We're going to
[1377.66s -> 1381.88s]  sell at 11. We're going to sell. Not yet. Not yet. This is just the first little peak.
[1382.52s -> 1386.95s]  It's not that we're not yet. Not yet. Wait, wait, wait. When is it going to hit 11? Once it hits 10.
[1386.95s -> 1404.39s]  Now I got it. This made 175,000 dollars. Buy more? Yeah. This could be the first. All right. Hold on.
[1404.39s -> 1411.88s]  Wait. No, no, no, no, no. What if it crashes? All right. Well, what about green groceries,
[1411.88s -> 1419.86s]  stocks, materials, water? Look at water is way down. I know water is up. Let's look at it. Look
[1420.18s -> 1422.90s]  coffee on the daily. Reduce on the daily is high too.
[1424.10s -> 1433.18s]  Buy green groceries on the daily. What's it look like? Everything's up. Should have sold only half.
[1433.18s -> 1442.10s]  Oh, fuck. All right. I'll get a small position of 5,000. I'm back in. I'm back in. I'm back in.
[1442.82s -> 1453.53s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Keep going. All right. Sell it. Sell it. Sell it.
[1454.25s -> 1460.78s]  Market's closed. At the end of each day, we offer our plan is not only an evaluation of the
[1460.78s -> 1468.33s]  performance, but also the opportunity to reflect it through personal account spending. You'll notice
[1468.33s -> 1475.32s]  that your initial personal account balance is negative $37,000. As I mentioned in the interview,
[1475.32s -> 1478.76s]  this is a paid internship. In the event of your termination, you'll be liable for this.
[1479.56s -> 1483.00s]  Feel free to have your parents write us a check if you would prefer to start at zero.
[1483.96s -> 1489.38s]  You shouldn't have any... I got to turn this music off. You shouldn't have... I got to change the
[1489.38s -> 1498.17s]  title of the screen. Once you're the black, make sure you utilize our bespoke concierge purchasing
[1498.17s -> 1503.77s]  service. I've had access to it installed in your terminal. It'll not only take care of purchasing
[1503.77s -> 1507.37s]  anything you can afford, but also handle any logistics required. We want you to focus on
[1507.37s -> 1511.13s]  making money. Let the experts tell you how to spend it. You won't tell anyone that your good
[1511.13s -> 1522.22s]  taste is actually there. Okay. I made a bunch of money. How much does she make? Okay. Make $5,000
[1522.22s -> 1528.60s]  on coffee. I made 50 grand. Public opinion. All right. My personal account. I got a free chair.
[1529.80s -> 1535.48s]  My furniture free includes three items. Honest Extravagant is in our house brand for your every
[1535.48s -> 1541.32s]  luxury you need. The first furniture box is free. Don't miss out. Look on go home when you're
[1541.32s -> 1552.68s]  finished with your purchases. Gear statue, grand toilet, and sofa. Okay. I can sell this stuff?
[1553.64s -> 1559.67s]  I don't want a fucking grand toilet. Get rid of it. Look at how much money I got now.
[1567.27s -> 1576.31s]  Sell everything. Wait, I want the sofa. I'm good. Workday's over. Leave the desk. Take care of
[1576.31s -> 1585.03s]  yourself. Nothing is planned for tonight. Okay. I got to shut off the 70s porn music. I just got
[1585.03s -> 1589.51s]  notification that you've paid off your personal account debt to the firm. Money is relatively
[1589.51s -> 1592.71s]  cheap and being afraid of debt is the kind of thing that nobody of any intelligence should be
[1592.71s -> 1599.67s]  concerned with. I suppose congratulations are in order. Congratulations. Of course, the real debt
[1599.67s -> 1604.31s]  you owe to Ferrios is the opportunity we gave to prove yourself. Life isn't fair and you're lucky
[1604.31s -> 1619.94s]  it isn't. Don't forget that. All right. Like let's just bring it down. Okay, cool. Okay,
[1619.94s -> 1632.92s]  I made a bunch of money on insider info. Unacceptable trading loss fired. They put his picture up
[1632.92s -> 1639.42s]  everywhere. Drinking coffee accelerates the flow of time. Use it when you're confident in your
[1639.42s -> 1656.46s]  positions. That's so stupid. What are you buying? Oil fuel? Video games? You're long on electro gear.
[1657.10s -> 1665.42s]  You're short on LW lot. Short on dark roast coffee. Clap. I grab his shoulder. Hard. Oh man,
[1665.42s -> 1684.23s]  you got killed today. Oh, I'm so sorry. Get a life. Hey, what'd you buy? Long on dark roast coffee.
[1684.23s -> 1694.36s]  All right. You know, you did a good job. What if you can't get me? What if I run real fast?
[1695.08s -> 1717.14s]  Do I have to go home? No, I just go home. What's going on? Timer 27. Coming up short.
[1717.86s -> 1727.74s]  Is it going to teach me how to open up like shorts and stuff? Need help with the help?
[1727.74s -> 1734.58s]  Automated scheduling. Payroll mitigation. Terminations. Serve AI. I'm sorry that I
[1734.58s -> 1739.24s]  didn't get the chance to meet you yesterday. I was taking a personal day. Quinn. Quinn Miller.
[1739.24s -> 1744.20s]  And yes, to get it out of the way, my grandparents did start the company that owns Ferrios. Please
[1744.20s -> 1748.60s]  don't worry. I'm not old or rich or gross. I'm here to work as hard as you do. I promise.
[1749.32s -> 1759.48s]  Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help. Dinner tonight. Wagyu beef. Buy beef.
[1760.20s -> 1766.20s]  Eat runner. Your true priority food courier service. No bicycles. No buy food. Buy meat.
[1766.20s -> 1769.72s]  I'm buying meat. Nobody else. I'm not telling anybody else that I'm buying food. I'm buying meat.
[1775.14s -> 1778.82s]  I'm trying to trade. So you met Quinn, huh? Make sure you don't cross her.
[1779.70s -> 1783.94s]  You can manage it actually. Stay the hell away from her completely. She might be a receptionist
[1783.94s -> 1787.22s]  or a concierge or whatever the fuck she calls herself, but she connects all the way to the top.
[1788.10s -> 1793.37s]  I heard someone once made Quinn photocopy a stack of documents. Quinn went on stress leave for two
[1793.37s -> 1799.40s]  weeks after and the guy who made her do it went on leave too. Permanently. Hey, you take care of you,
[1799.40s -> 1804.76s]  I'll take care of me. Oh, by the way, I heard there's a bunch of fucking like,
[1804.76s -> 1810.54s]  bunch of dirty rotten like cows and beef and shit. I would short meat. I would short beef
[1810.54s -> 1819.26s]  the second I got on my terminal. I heard there's a bunch of problems with it. Idiot. Yeah,
[1819.26s -> 1829.59s]  everybody's going vegan. All my friends are going vegan by the way. Didn't labor dispute at DRC
[1829.59s -> 1837.61s]  poised to surface. Earth and dark roast coffee bounce back hard. Good morning. It's time you
[1837.61s -> 1840.89s]  learned about short selling. I've unlocked the capability to do this in your terminal.
[1841.45s -> 1846.06s]  I realize that you've only had a single day to get oriented around a simple transaction,
[1846.06s -> 1849.02s]  but the firm is losing money every second that you aren't doing this. Enough is enough.
[1849.82s -> 1853.34s]  Short selling is where we borrow shares of a stock at its current price with the belief that
[1853.34s -> 1860.02s]  this price will decrease. If it does decrease, we profit off the difference between that initial
[1860.10s -> 1865.86s]  price and the price it is at when we execute the buyback. Doing this will also give you
[1865.86s -> 1870.34s]  cash on hand to buy other stocks that you think will increase in value taking a long position on
[1870.34s -> 1875.78s]  them. GME. That should be all you need to know. It seems as if dark roast coffee will see a lot
[1875.78s -> 1879.70s]  of movement today as well. So that may be an opportunity for you to short sell us into a nice
[1879.70s -> 1887.06s]  little payday. Maybe it'll give you an opportunity to short a stock at 140% of the shares that are
[1887.06s -> 1897.08s]  available to short more than exist 40% more than exist total. We do that. Maybe I should do that.
[1899.74s -> 1902.38s]  Be sure to make use of any information that you may have at your disposal.
[1905.69s -> 1909.45s]  Short selling is the sale of a stock you do not own. You immediately get some cash,
[1909.45s -> 1913.85s]  but you have to buy back the shares later. You should use it to bet on the fall of dark roast
[1913.85s -> 1919.32s]  coffee and use the cash for new long orders. All right, so coffee will drop at 14. We're
[1919.32s -> 1923.80s]  going to short coffee right now. I'm going to wait though. Let's see. It's probably going to
[1923.80s -> 1930.54s]  go a little higher. Leave me the fuck alone. I'm working. You should get all this personal
[1930.54s -> 1934.14s]  shit off your desk. It makes you look like an asshole. Hey, you know, it makes you look like
[1934.14s -> 1941.16s]  an asshole. Coming over and telling me my stuff on my desk looks stupid. Get out of here. Also,
[1941.16s -> 1945.88s]  I see that Corbin gave you access to shorting. You somehow managed to make some cash from shorting,
[1945.88s -> 1951.24s]  DRC wink, wink. You should really consider buying star nuts and going long on it. What the fuck do
[1951.24s -> 1956.60s]  you know? After coffee crashes, star nuts is only going to rise over time in response. Investing in
[1956.60s -> 1962.12s]  star nuts will pay off. I guarantee it. I'm long on star nuts myself. Obviously I wouldn't give you
[1962.12s -> 1968.38s]  advice if it wasn't good for me too. Show me your portfolio right now. Show me your portfolio right
[1968.38s -> 1973.82s]  now that you have already taken a position in star nuts right now and I'll do it. I got tickets to
[1973.82s -> 1980.06s]  that thing tonight. If you're good to chip in on bottle service afterwards, later trader. Okay,
[1980.06s -> 1983.82s]  beverages supply chain include coffee. So beverages will surge as coffee drops
[1985.16s -> 1990.60s]  our star nuts star nuts sells beverages. So it will surge with them. So go long on star nuts.
[1991.56s -> 1998.30s]  Oh, hold on. No, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got to make a
[1998.30s -> 2004.07s]  decision here. Check out the glossary for more information. I know, I know, I know what's going
[2004.07s -> 2013.64s]  on. I'm going to do short position on coffee or a hundred thousand shares. I'm going to go back to
[2013.64s -> 2020.26s]  coffee. We're going to go to beverages star nuts. I'm going to star nuts is is a little high right
[2020.26s -> 2035.26s]  now though. Long 150,000 long. This is coming down. Don't buy. I'm not going to buy it. That'd be
[2035.26s -> 2041.45s]  stupid. I'm just going off the dispute. That's going to happen. Coffee is going to drop around
[2041.45s -> 2060.39s]  14 short the hell out of it. I'm going to get blown up. I'm going to get blown up. I'm going
[2060.39s -> 2076.09s]  to get blown up. Okay. It's going down. Here comes the big announcement. I'm short minus 172
[2076.09s -> 2092.50s]  thousand. Again, I have 357 thousand dollars. Buy star nuts now. No, I'm not buying star nuts.
[2093.06s -> 2104.25s]  Wait, should I buy star nuts? I'm going to go long. Not that big of a position. 10,000. I'm long on
[2104.25s -> 2112.82s]  star nuts. Okay, I'm getting ready. Here comes the announcement. 14. We're going to buy the shares back.
[2118.09s -> 2123.77s]  Buy more. No, I'm not. Here we go. Scandal in Baccarat's coffee industry. Shit's tanking.
[2125.43s -> 2129.05s]  We're fucking around with coffee. Jesus Christ. All right, here we go.
[2129.77s -> 2142.38s]  Buying back in. Not yet. Not yet. Buy back in in a second. It's going to drop even more. It's coming
[2142.38s -> 2153.54s]  down. This is a 27,000 dollar benefit here. Come on. More. Put it on the hourly. Yeah. Star nuts.
[2155.53s -> 2175.64s]  Sell it. Should I do it now? Buy back at 8.8. I'm done. I'm done. My position is done.
[2176.65s -> 2182.95s]  Newly discovered produce alternative leads to decreased prices. Computation predicts green
[2182.95s -> 2189.30s]  grocers will rise. Oh, god damn it. Short green grocers. Short green grocers. Short green grocers
[2189.30s -> 2200.52s]  for 10,000. I told you. Look at this peak. This shit's coming back down to like three point. All
[2200.52s -> 2207.69s]  right. What do I get for that? I'm down 240 dollars. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get
[2207.69s -> 2217.59s]  out. I'm fine. Anti-trust regulations are holding the food stuff business back. Fuck. I want to buy
[2217.59s -> 2225.67s]  it. How do I buy it? Foodstuffs is. I should have. I should have bought the materials. Products.
[2226.55s -> 2234.06s]  I can't. How do I? I can't buy this. Uno eats is going up. Let's go boys. Go. Go. Go.
[2235.03s -> 2247.72s]  Go. Go. Go. Go. Yeah. I got it at six. I think I just bought the top. I think I bought the top.
[2247.72s -> 2262.62s]  I think I got. I got. No. It's going to go up. Unexpected demand for produce chokes existing supply.
[2265.29s -> 2269.67s]  Produce. Look. Look. Look. Look. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Uno eats is going
[2269.67s -> 2277.66s]  back up. Holy shit. And you told me I was stupid. You guys told me I was dumb. Are you kidding me?
[2277.66s -> 2293.82s]  Look at that. Oh, I'm so dumb for buying uno eats. Get out. Did I sell it? Did I get it out? Did I
[2293.82s -> 2299.32s]  get this? Did I sell it? Is my order going? During your end day value, you'll notice that it includes
[2299.32s -> 2306.20s]  a public opinion metric. If you're doing your job properly, this shouldn't be something you'll have
[2306.20s -> 2310.28s]  to worry about. You start going overboard with the use of information that you obviously gained
[2310.28s -> 2315.37s]  through illicit means. However, the media might start to take notice. Eventually, if enough op
[2315.37s -> 2318.73s]  ads get written, the Trade and Investment Commission will be forced to make a show of launching an
[2318.73s -> 2323.37s]  investigation that can end with you in court. Unless I tell you otherwise, don't think a second
[2323.37s -> 2328.33s]  that the company is going to pay out for any fines or legal fees. Agreed your problem.
[2329.37s -> 2339.10s]  Bye. Did I get, did I sell it? Let's see. Did I, did I get, did I actually get to sell it?
[2343.08s -> 2343.88s]  Buy furniture.
[2347.24s -> 2355.98s]  Ooh, nice. Designer chair. I want that. I'm selling the sofa. Do I want the designer chair or the
[2355.98s -> 2372.42s]  executive chair? I want the, I want the designer chair. Okay, cool. Yeah, I want something better
[2372.42s -> 2387.61s]  than this. So food stuffs is like, like an index, right? I wish the ancient fucks who won't let them
[2387.61s -> 2402.54s]  go would die of old age already. Solitaire. All right, cool. I kind of want to break a window,
[2405.27s -> 2430.25s]  office drama. Wow. Where's the party tonight? Kill or be killed. All right, first of all,
[2430.25s -> 2434.97s]  I need to do something very quickly here. This has to change. Looking for grandma's antiques.
[2434.97s -> 2454.95s]  It doesn't make any sense right now. Um, it does not. Uh, getting liquidated. You know,
[2454.95s -> 2467.56s]  how about probably, probably getting liquidated? I think that's a good title. Here we go. Sorry
[2467.56s -> 2470.60s]  if this is none of my business, but you look a little stressed out. I'm sure you've been
[2470.60s -> 2475.08s]  introduced to the coffee situation, but have you tried the tea yet? It has the opposite effect.
[2475.80s -> 2479.54s]  When I drink it, it feels like the whole world slows down. Focusing on small details becomes
[2479.54s -> 2484.39s]  easier and I stop worrying that things are constantly passing by. Wait, so coffee,
[2484.39s -> 2502.25s]  coffee speeds up time. Tea slows down time. Okay. Where's my new chair? I installed a strong
[2502.25s -> 2508.02s]  coffee last night. Guys who loaded into the machines were practically wearing hazmat suits.
[2508.66s -> 2519.66s]  I want to clean up my desk a little. Oh, fuck. Hold on. All right. What we got?
[2522.68s -> 2533.03s]  Sit down. Okay. What we got? Greengrocer's revitalized destitute cities. Greengrocer's
[2533.03s -> 2541.86s]  stock is headed. Let me guess. You sat down at your desk and went straight to Geiss net
[2541.86s -> 2546.82s]  only to find it replaced by an extremely boring cable news network. It sucks, but sometimes
[2546.82s -> 2550.50s]  journalism gets in the way of worthwhile information. When the insiders don't have
[2550.50s -> 2555.30s]  anything interesting for us, we have to get by like everyone else. You best to read between
[2555.30s -> 2560.02s]  the lines though. You can still make a few bucks at the very least. In can clue you in on what
[2560.02s -> 2566.52s]  suckers are paying attention to. At that point, sometimes all you have to do is be more cynical
[2566.52s -> 2576.07s]  than they are. Later. Greengrocer's stock is headed upward after the company announced plans
[2576.07s -> 2579.91s]  to open hundreds of new stores in cities devastated by the closure of auto factories.
[2579.91s -> 2583.59s]  Company spokesman confirmed that all the cities chosen are expected to see increased interest
[2583.59s -> 2587.59s]  from high tech software firms looking to expand their office footprint.
[2593.99s -> 2597.35s]  Grade feed shows short lived bits of information about what's going on in the market.
[2597.99s -> 2602.23s]  They're not equally all accurate. The number of likes is what you should focus on.
[2605.26s -> 2609.02s]  Easing of tariffs should increase the value of green grocers in the near future. Follow.
[2613.22s -> 2618.68s]  I gotta get these blinking things off screen. Yeah. Long short materials. Okay. Yeah. I know
[2618.68s -> 2628.63s]  what that is loss. All right, let's go. All right. So green grocers easing of
[2628.63s -> 2634.17s]  tariffs for green grocers. All right. Hold on a minute. Aqua firma announces new brand.
[2634.17s -> 2641.64s]  Aqua firma has a new brand along a hundred thousand out in perfect timing. All right.
[2642.36s -> 2657.51s]  We're going to get out of four or what about abundant source of water discovered threatening
[2657.51s -> 2660.47s]  price decline on water. Now I'm not paying. I don't have to. I can only pay attention
[2660.47s -> 2669.08s]  to one thing at a time. I get out now. That's good. Good. All right. Green grocers with short
[2669.08s -> 2676.78s]  green grocers. I think, I think I'm going to put a short on green grocers. This is going up too
[2676.78s -> 2688.07s]  high. All in on a short and green grocers. Let's go. We're getting out of 4.5. Oh, it's all right.
[2688.07s -> 2700.74s]  It's coming back. Oh no. Oh no. That's not good at the T. Hold on. Oh, oh no. Oh no.
[2701.70s -> 2705.86s]  Why do they do that? You guys just have to hold it for a second. Just hold it. It's coming back
[2705.86s -> 2718.97s]  down. It's coming back down. Okay. It's going to drop. It's going to drop. It's going to drop.
[2718.97s -> 2722.97s]  It's going to drop. It's going to drop back down to like four bucks. This is wicked bad copium.
[2722.97s -> 2731.08s]  No, it's not. I got to make $20,000 on coffee related. God damn it. All right. We're going long
[2731.08s -> 2739.13s]  on coffee. 75 right here. It's at the bottom. It's going to pop up. Green grocers is going to hit a
[2739.29s -> 2747.74s]  peak. It's going to come down. Unexpected demand for produce. Produce, produce, produce, stock,
[2747.74s -> 2756.98s]  stock, stock, produce. New regulations are holding food stuff business back. God damn it. Go down.
[2756.98s -> 2763.14s]  Green grocers. What the fuck? Oh my God. I've lost so much money on green grocers so far.
[2763.14s -> 2777.61s]  Unexpected demand for produce. Fuck. I got to get out. I got to get out. Wait. Dark roast coffee.
[2777.61s -> 2781.05s]  Where's my dark roast coffee position? Is what? What was it? It was a long position. Get out,
[2781.05s -> 2786.42s]  get out, get out. Perfect timing to get out. Green grocers just fucking shit the bed already.
[2786.42s -> 2798.97s]  Come on. Food stuff is going up again. Oh my God. Old coward. Am I short coffee?
[2801.16s -> 2805.16s]  Food stuff's down. Aqua firma up. I need to make money on coffee. All right.
[2805.16s -> 2813.18s]  But I'm short in food. I'm starting to shorten coffee. Green grocers. God damn it. I have to
[2813.18s -> 2817.26s]  get out. I have to get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.
[2817.26s -> 2820.30s]  I'm not going to lose all that money. It's going to go up to like eight bucks. Dark
[2820.30s -> 2828.79s]  grocers coffee. We're going to... Here it comes. Here comes the bad news for coffee.
[2829.43s -> 2836.31s]  What's Starbucks doing? Shit. Get out. Get out. Go, go, go, go, go. Short, short, short, short,
[2836.31s -> 2847.91s]  short, short, short. I'm down. How am I down on money? Bring it down. Down, down, down, down,
[2847.91s -> 2857.22s]  down. Yes. More, more, more, more. Wait. Aqua firms. Don't waste another second on aqua firms.
[2857.22s -> 2867.27s]  What? All right. All right. All right. Fine. I'm going to buy. 6.4. Remember that. Up 4.2 thousand
[2867.91s -> 2876.07s]  on the dark gross coffee. How are we doing? We're up on both. Dark gross coffee is still
[2876.07s -> 2882.63s]  going to go down. It's going to, it's going to touch 5.5. This is, this is a good position so far.
[2888.71s -> 2893.16s]  And I'm going to get out really soon here. This is going to peak. I'm going to say it's going to
[2893.16s -> 2901.96s]  touch eight. Okay. And I'm going to take the profits right now. Get out. And on this one too.
[2903.80s -> 2907.90s]  All right. I'm looking for Starbucks. We're going to go long on Starbucks.
[2908.54s -> 2918.60s]  29. 100,000 belong right now. Aqua firm is going places. I don't. Okay. Aqua firma,
[2918.60s -> 2937.98s]  aqua firma. Come on Starbucks. Let's go. Come on. What? Okay. No evidence today.
[2938.54s -> 2949.11s]  Apply your profits and losses to the debt. That's actually kind of funny.
[2952.09s -> 2957.74s]  I'm going to hold this money. Fly profits or losses to the debt.
[2960.57s -> 2968.02s]  I'm going to short potato PC cafe later this week.
[2968.98s -> 2974.04s]  The box just got their only team kicked out of some big e-sports thing for cheating.
[2974.92s -> 2980.76s]  Fucking idiots. Okay. Interesting. All right. I'm going to do the same thing.
[2981.48s -> 2999.51s]  Short that PC e-sports company. Deal. Okay. How do you keep track of that? That's a good question.
[2999.51s -> 3010.62s]  I don't know. Drink the tea. Yeah. All right. I'm going to drink the tea today.
[3011.26s -> 3016.71s]  I'm thinking of replacing chef Burgundy if he doesn't get his act together.
[3016.71s -> 3019.67s]  You expect a gourmet chef to get fussy when you tell them to do basically anything,
[3019.67s -> 3024.79s]  but it's supposed to be a good fun. When he started, he was very yuric about it.
[3024.79s -> 3028.97s]  It was charming. It's different. He's depressed or something. Can you believe that?
[3028.97s -> 3039.32s]  A guy who yells at people about foie gras for a living. It's bad energy. Whatever. Drink the tea.
[3040.36s -> 3049.32s]  All right. I'm going to drink tea. Tea strength. Well, not in the ad. Market's not even open.
[3050.04s -> 3059.86s]  You know, Eats expansion across free states fuels growth, rise in stock price.
[3061.61s -> 3066.09s]  Spike criticism to the chin. All right. We buying, uh, you know, eats food. Stuff is going down.
[3066.89s -> 3072.60s]  Okay. Food stuffs. We're talking about, um, our gross coffee going down. Starnucks going down.
[3073.24s -> 3080.41s]  Uh, short it. Um, I can't short it. Why was, wait, I have a position open. What's my position? What
[3080.41s -> 3085.66s]  the fuck is this position? It's open. What's that? What's going on? What? I don't have an open long
[3085.66s -> 3102.57s]  position in Starbucks. What the fuck happened? I'm going to drink tea. Drink. That's from yesterday.
[3105.85s -> 3113.27s]  All right. Let's go. Time is slowed down. You know, eats expansion. Coffee is going up.
[3113.91s -> 3122.12s]  Oh, but it's already so high. What about uno eats? Uno eats is going. Okay. We're going to do a long
[3122.12s -> 3135.50s]  position. A hundred thousand. Then that was at nine 30. What's the other, what's the big chart
[3135.50s -> 3138.70s]  look like? The daily chart. Nah, this looks like it could go up. It's going to go up.
[3139.50s -> 3147.18s]  Food stuffs, green grocers, coffee schedule to go up. Why am I talking like it's a slow motion?
[3147.82s -> 3166.44s]  Who eats? Come on, let's go. Why is it going down? Weed stocks. I can't believe I kept that
[3166.44s -> 3171.38s]  position open from yesterday. Who eats is still going down. All right. Come on. Give me something
[3171.38s -> 3187.34s]  new here that I can react to immediately. Cocaine and weed should be an option. There we go. I need
[3187.34s -> 3195.91s]  coffee related wins and losses. Dark roast coffee. Should I put a short up?
[3197.77s -> 3201.29s]  I think so. Wait. International trade agreement is expanding. Beverages market.
[3202.01s -> 3212.55s]  Beverages going up. Aqua firma. News is just barely getting out here.
[3215.13s -> 3221.91s]  Come on, let's go. How am I losing money on this? This is skyrocketing. How am I losing money? Minus
[3221.91s -> 3233.67s]  800? What the fuck? You bought at the top. No, I didn't. That just, the news just came out.
[3233.67s -> 3241.93s]  Water is going down. Oh shit. That is water. Aqua firma is water. What? Beverages. Shit. Long
[3241.93s -> 3253.64s]  on Starbucks. Uno eats is going to go down. Close that position on Uno eats. CEO's personal mail
[3253.64s -> 3265.74s]  from Uno eats leaked. Okay. Starbucks is. Wow. Whoa. What? What? Beverages and coffee. I thought
[3265.74s -> 3283.93s]  coffee was going up. What the hell? What the fuck? Oh my God. Beverages. Coffee. Look, unexpected
[3283.93s -> 3291.70s]  demand for coffee chokes existing supply. This shit is tanking. Beverages aren't coffee. What?
[3291.70s -> 3307.11s]  How does that make any sense? How long does the tea work for? Green grocery is going down.
[3307.75s -> 3311.64s]  I'm going to hold the Starbucks position because I think it's going to explode tomorrow.
[3314.57s -> 3330.14s]  Minus a hundred thousand dollars. Come on. Don't do that. Shit. Green grocery is coffee going up.
[3330.14s -> 3344.15s]  Green. I can't go into green groceries right now. Uno eats. Here we go. Come on. Drop. Drop.
[3347.48s -> 3350.04s]  Hold. I'm going to hold the Starbucks position. I keep saying Starbucks.
[3353.34s -> 3359.80s]  There's going to be a big pop tomorrow for coffee. I'm not going to get fired today. I have 74,000
[3359.80s -> 3372.44s]  dollars. All right. Here we go. Uno eats. That data is just leaking right now. Does nobody care
[3372.44s -> 3392.57s]  about this? Nobody cares about this. There we go. We're talking about it. Come on. Fuck. There we go.
[3392.57s -> 3405.82s]  Okay. This will save us today. 500 bucks. That's it. Keep going. More people are going to start
[3405.82s -> 3421.77s]  talking about the CEO of Uno eats. Only 1.4. Is it going to bounce? Don't bounce. Back under nine.
[3421.77s -> 3432.12s]  Come on. You lost a million dollars. No, I didn't. I'm down 31,000. I take a thousand dollars and
[3432.12s -> 3444.66s]  run. What do I do? I'm getting crushed with this. It's three news articles, not just one.
[3446.10s -> 3453.08s]  Oh shit. Oh my God. I didn't even realize that. Okay. Well, whatever. Star Nux is coming back.
[3453.08s -> 3465.94s]  It'll come back tomorrow. Beverage is going up. Beverage is going up. Innovation breakthrough
[3465.94s -> 3475.29s]  in beverages. Product category leads to surge in demand. I got to close this. I'm closing this
[3475.29s -> 3497.91s]  trade. I bought water. How was that on a beverage? Water is a beverage. I'm putting zero likes. What
[3497.91s -> 3511.48s]  the fuck? Oh my God. Why? There we go. All right. It's going up. Do this on an IRL stream. No fucking
[3511.48s -> 3525.58s]  way. Not a chance in hell. You keep falling for clickbait. I have to hold the Star Nux position.
[3529.02s -> 3537.56s]  No, I got killed. Just absolutely decimated. Answer the phone. Oh my God. This is bad.
[3538.28s -> 3544.17s]  It's not even recovering at all. It's horrible. I have to hold this until tomorrow. I have to
[3544.17s -> 3561.59s]  continue to hold this. Dump the water stocks. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I got out. I need Star Nux to
[3561.59s -> 3572.76s]  come back. Stocks category is above its graph. Oh shit. Well, why did I get out of water? Look at
[3572.76s -> 3590.22s]  it. Now it's going crazy. What the fuck? Oh my God. Are you kidding me? Don't do that. I'm going
[3590.22s -> 3602.10s]  back and I'm drinking coffee. What a disaster. I've never bought into Electrogear Emporium.
[3602.74s -> 3610.73s]  Everyone buys that shit online now. Bring enough coffee so the stock goes up.
[3616.70s -> 3644.73s]  Just buy the dip. You know? That's not a bad idea. That's not a bad idea. All in. All in on
[3644.73s -> 3659.22s]  Starbuck. I keep saying that's not a real company. There it comes. I bought into the dip. No. No. Up.
[3660.49s -> 3669.85s]  Look at where this was. Jesus. That's not good. That's really bad. The dip is dipping. I need to
[3669.85s -> 3688.26s]  make money on coffee. Come on. Star Nux introduces new spiced pumpkin frappuccino. Oh, go down.
[3689.14s -> 3695.54s]  Oh my God. I thought computation predicts green growth. What do you mean computation?
[3696.18s -> 3703.67s]  Coffee's going up. Food stuff's going down. Coffee going up. Is the Starbucks plug going to work?
[3703.67s -> 3710.97s]  Price of beverages is rising. Starbucks is a beverage, right? Get out of this. Get out of this.
[3712.79s -> 3720.39s]  Oh, all of you naysayers. All of you naysayers. This is going to be a... Oh my God. And you told
[3720.39s -> 3730.55s]  me I was fucking wrong. This is a hundred thousand dollar plus trade. I'm going to hold it for another
[3730.55s -> 3748.78s]  minute. Seventy six thousand. I get out now. I'll hold it. I'll take the profit. I'm out. Seventy five
[3748.78s -> 3757.16s]  thousand dollars. Everybody just calling me out. That's fine. Give me some more coffee.
[3763.34s -> 3787.69s]  What happened to you? Did you short coffee? Yum. I think this is back to normal now.
[3787.69s -> 3791.61s]  What do we got? That was a good trading day. I made a hundred grand. Are you kidding me?
[3792.25s -> 3805.91s]  We got out of the perfect opportunity right at the top. Coffee again going up. I'm done for the day.
[3805.91s -> 3809.91s]  I'm done for the trading day. Maybe one more trade to take it in tomorrow. What's like... What's
[3809.91s -> 3816.25s]  beating up right now? Uno Eats is really just beat up. We're going long on Uno Eats. And I'm
[3816.25s -> 3823.75s]  going two hundred fifty fucking thousand shares. Uno Eats. Look at this. It's been absolutely
[3823.75s -> 3833.50s]  decimated. There's no reason for that. CEO leaked something. Whatever it was. Oh, and that was a
[3833.50s -> 3837.02s]  stupid idea. But apparently Jeremy knows how to trade fucking stocks and everybody here doesn't
[3837.02s -> 3850.15s]  understand it. That's fine. Go green with Uno Eats. Oh, wow. What's that? Excuse me. The CEO
[3850.15s -> 3853.67s]  like fucking leaked like a nude picture of himself or something. That has nothing to do with the
[3853.67s -> 3868.26s]  company. Get out. I'm out. We got out a little early, but I want to secure that profit because
[3868.26s -> 3881.50s]  something could happen tomorrow. There we go. Secured. That was a big day. Mustache made him...
[3881.50s -> 3891.32s]  Wait, I got fired? Oh no, they got fired. New rival promoted. I got promoted. Owned his fifty
[3891.32s -> 3897.29s]  three thousand. Eighty six thousand dollars today. This game's fun. I like this game.
[3899.45s -> 3904.14s]  Hario's makes point of investing in employees who show potential. The additional truth is that we
[3904.14s -> 3910.82s]  don't want to be associated with people who live in squalor. Have you started investing in real estate?
[3911.62s -> 3915.78s]  I'm asking rhetorically, of course. I know you haven't, but I've got good news. The firm retains
[3915.78s -> 3921.46s]  a number of condominiums in the city for analysts in your exact position. You'll see that your
[3921.46s -> 3926.02s]  terminal now has access to a personal real estate service. Start by claiming the condo we've given
[3926.02s -> 3929.78s]  you, which is seating in the market, and eventually you might get the chance to grow into a bigger
[3929.78s -> 3933.56s]  place of your own. Screw up and you'll be right back where you started, wherever that was.
[3934.28s -> 3944.22s]  Buy. First condo is financed by Hario's. All right, you got three decoration slots in your condo.
[3944.22s -> 3950.90s]  Here's your property. Market value, twenty eight thousand. You can store luxury items in your
[3950.90s -> 3957.74s]  properties. It will increase their market value when leasing or selling them. When decoration is
[3957.74s -> 3964.47s]  up to standard, you should put this property on lease for sweet landlord income. All right, how
[3964.47s -> 3981.94s]  about a designer chair? Fair statue and an analyst certificate. I'm sorry, condo. Do I lease it? Do I
[3981.94s -> 3992.06s]  make money from this? Sell condo, easy money. Well, not yet. He's a landlord. Get him. Well,
[3992.86s -> 3998.34s]  I want to make my price fair. This is where I live. Oh, I don't need to lease it. Look at the money
[3998.34s -> 4005.30s]  I got in my bank account because I'm living here. I'll buy a car. I'll buy a car. I'll buy another
[4005.30s -> 4024.87s]  condo. Should I buy two condos? I have two condos. Why did I do that? I just have two condos. All
[4024.87s -> 4031.86s]  right. Well, then I'll rent this one, right? Is that how it works? Lease the second one.
[4035.45s -> 4044.90s]  Okay. Is that, so everybody another condo? I lease this condo. How many condos should I have?
[4046.42s -> 4052.23s]  All right. I'm not, no more condos. Stop. What the fuck? Well, I, I just, what? I'm leasing the condo.
[4052.23s -> 4066.25s]  Look, I made a hundred thousand dollars yesterday on star Nux. Wait, buy furniture. 40,000.
[4069.03s -> 4073.45s]  Okay. Nice. This is going to be, okay. The gold toilets going in there. That's worth a lot of
[4073.45s -> 4092.76s]  money. Tell the gold toilet for 20,000. Holy shit. 10,000 for this bust. I'll just, no, why
[4092.76s -> 4101.72s]  did I do that? Oops. It's all right. Right on the condo. You can't be serious about this. My
[4101.72s -> 4107.72s]  performance has been exceptional. Sorry, Mrs. Lee, but the probationary terms are clearly specified.
[4107.72s -> 4113.64s]  There's no room at Ferrios for second best. This is an issue of principle. My trades were flawless
[4113.64s -> 4119.32s]  and my analysis of trade feed was perfect. It was not. You took losses at several points
[4120.12s -> 4124.25s]  and I always made up for them. The only way you could have possibly come out ahead of me is if you,
[4125.37s -> 4129.05s]  I saw it happening, but I figured that you would. I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
[4130.01s -> 4137.61s]  I didn't even use insider information. I was just a moron. I just saw, I saw the number
[4138.25s -> 4142.33s]  low and I put all of my money into it and the number went up and I sold.
[4143.74s -> 4148.70s]  I didn't do anything. I just, I was just an idiot. Thank you for your time. I'll be pleased to provide
[4148.70s -> 4153.53s]  you with a reference. You think I don't know what's going on here? You would have to be blind.
[4154.25s -> 4160.12s]  You're barely even trying to hide it. Mrs. Lee, your family is very well respected. Please don't
[4160.12s -> 4164.20s]  compel me to have security escort you from the building or there to be any kind of public
[4164.20s -> 4169.46s]  unpleasantness. Public unpleasantness? Does talking like that make you feel like you come
[4169.46s -> 4175.14s]  from somewhere? You couldn't keep me in this shithole at gunpoint. Bye, Mrs. Lee. Fuck you.
[4175.86s -> 4185.53s]  But she didn't, she said, she said, she said, she said, I can't say it. She didn't, she didn't see
[4185.53s -> 4191.77s]  shit by the way. Sorry about that. I trade better than I talk. Don't worry about Mrs. Lee. I'm sure
[4191.77s -> 4195.29s]  she'll find another firm that will take her. And if not, the world's always looking for wealthy
[4195.29s -> 4206.52s]  tourists. Congratulations again. Keep your eye on the ball. All right. All right. All right. I got
[4206.52s -> 4222.76s]  money. I got money. I'm good. I got it. What are you doing? Holy shit. This dude, this dude lost
[4222.76s -> 4239.56s]  $2 million today. 1.8 million loss. I'll take my 60, I'll take my $78,000 gain and make my way. Oh,
[4239.56s -> 4244.62s]  that's like such, I'm such a small fry. The person walked up from the desk and they didn't even turn
[4244.62s -> 4249.90s]  their computer off with a $2 million loss. I'm sitting here celebrating with like $70,000 trade.
[4253.83s -> 4276.44s]  It's got a $10 million account. Small time. Quit streaming in day trade. You know that like 98%
[4276.44s -> 4280.52s]  of day traders lose money or something, whatever the statistic is. I don't think I want to do that.
[4281.64s -> 4289.40s]  I don't think I would like to do that. I should probably read this. Hell, I'm already tired of
[4289.40s -> 4294.12s]  the car I bought a week ago. Expensive tastes never keeps up with the easy boredom. That's a
[4294.12s -> 4299.02s]  problem with everybody in this fucking business. You'll be happier after I get you tossed out of
[4299.02s -> 4302.86s]  here, but I know you won't believe it until it happens. Until then, do your worst, kiddo.
[4303.66s -> 4313.66s]  A lot of people are rooting for you to take out Clark. The space that she's washed up has been,
[4313.66s -> 4318.22s]  maybe even it never was. Sure, she made a lot of money, but as somebody who comes from that world,
[4318.22s -> 4323.42s]  I can tell you that she has no class. People like her don't belong here. Don't tell her I said this,
[4323.42s -> 4328.38s]  but I'll be happy if she was sleeping in a pile of cardboard. Oh my god. So sick of her. I'm too
[4328.38s -> 4333.90s]  cool for this world. Wouldn't it be better if we could let it all go attitude? Make the dream come
[4333.90s -> 4349.88s]  true. You got this. All right, I gotta get ready for the day. Following the demands of coffee
[4349.88s -> 4354.04s]  plantation workers being met in Bocador, a second labor crisis has now sprung up in their oil
[4354.04s -> 4364.78s]  industry. Northern oil and gas will rally after 16. Northern oil and gas. How much money do I got?
[4364.78s -> 4375.19s]  I got $500,000 in cash. Northern oil and gas is going to rally at 16. I'm going to put all my
[4375.19s -> 4383.08s]  money in this. Wait till it falls a little more. I'm looking for a good entry. Right there. Go.
[4388.07s -> 4393.34s]  What? What's up buddy? I take it you've seen the news about oil going down a little bit and the
[4393.34s -> 4397.98s]  Geissnet post about it going up a whole lot. Well today is going to be a wild one. We're going to
[4397.98s -> 4403.51s]  fuck up both those expectations and make a killing doing it. Let me introduce you to our lobbyists.
[4405.18s -> 4410.38s]  You can let them sweat the details, but we deploy lobbyists when we want to put pressure on a stock
[4410.38s -> 4415.53s]  price to go in one direction or the other without buying or selling it. In this case,
[4415.53s -> 4418.73s]  I want you to send them out to make oil prices go through the floor.
[4419.53s -> 4426.71s]  No! Harper, I just bought it. Can we just wait? They'll fly to Bocador, yell at a few people,
[4426.71s -> 4429.91s]  and make sure that not only does that government bailout for Northern never come through,
[4430.79s -> 4436.23s]  but that a whole lot of bullshit gets kicked up as a result. The oil price won't just go down a
[4436.23s -> 4441.82s]  little, it'll go down by a ton, and should let us beat up on anybody who expected anything else.
[4443.58s -> 4449.61s]  I just put $500,000 on the line. After you assign a lobbyist, short the hell out of anything related
[4449.61s -> 4456.79s]  to oil and watch as it magically tanks. Wait, but hold on. Hold on, I need to drink tea. I'll be right
[4456.79s -> 4463.93s]  back. No, stop! You're not the first glorified trainee I've had to send home and you won't be
[4463.93s -> 4468.81s]  the last. Remember what I told you. You don't really... Just let me go do my drugs. I'll be
[4468.81s -> 4483.35s]  right back. Thank you. Just a little bit of slow down so I can have another second or two. See the
[4483.35s -> 4489.80s]  news about the oil? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, shit. Okay, I gotta get out of this trade. Send
[4489.80s -> 4494.28s]  lobbyists to lower the price of oil. Lower the price of... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4494.28s -> 4498.04s]  Sending lobbyists to lower the price of oil will decrease the value of oil suppliers.
[4498.60s -> 4504.06s]  Short Northern oil and gas before you send in lobbyists. Okay, stocks, oil and gas.
[4508.55s -> 4515.35s]  Sis, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out. Short it. Okay, I'm gonna short oil and gas
[4516.15s -> 4528.54s]  and then I'm gonna send in the lobbyists. How do I do that? How do I do that? Oil. Use the lobby
[4528.54s -> 4532.70s]  controls to send a lobbyist in. Okay, send in lobbyists to make it go down. Sending lobbyists
[4532.70s -> 4536.54s]  to lower the price of oil will also increase the value of the products it is an ingredient in.
[4537.10s -> 4546.70s]  It's going long on plastics. Well, what the fuck? Long on plastic? All right, all right, all right,
[4546.70s -> 4556.20s]  all right, all right. So what we got? How much money do we have? Send in more lobbyists.
[4557.21s -> 4565.32s]  Make plastic go up. What are we doing? I'm up, I'm up a little bit on these.
[4566.04s -> 4591.96s]  Gas is going down. Send in more lobbyists. More. More. Okay, that's a big trade so far.
[4592.68s -> 4600.10s]  What happened? What happened? Why did it sell that? I didn't want to sell that. What are my positions?
[4600.10s -> 4607.16s]  Why did they close everything? Shortage of oil? Hey, why did you sell my shit? Nice job on sending
[4607.16s -> 4610.12s]  out the lobbyists to drive the oil market down. They told me they couldn't have done it without
[4610.12s -> 4620.44s]  you. They're probably just sucking you off, but I guess you don't get whatever. As expected,
[4620.44s -> 4623.64s]  the sudden drop in value created chaos and instability, but then it shot right back up
[4623.64s -> 4629.75s]  after textbook stuff. Your short positions would have been worthless, so I automatically sold them
[4629.75s -> 4633.75s]  for you. We've gotten some bad press with the whole situation, but nothing PR can't handle.
[4634.55s -> 4639.54s]  Speaking of the reactions of the pathetic losers, I forgot to tell you about the public opinion meter.
[4640.76s -> 4644.92s]  You look at your terminal, you'll see a speedometer type thing. It gets
[4644.92s -> 4650.20s]  tilted around by the tooth-bleached rectangle people at our PR agency based on how much bad
[4650.20s -> 4656.17s]  shit happens in the world thanks to us. Pay attention to those, because if the things you
[4656.17s -> 4660.82s]  do in the market pisses people off too much, bad things can happen. Friending hashtags,
[4660.82s -> 4666.50s]  people crying on camera, persecution from trust-funded commie bloggers, etc. You might
[4666.50s -> 4669.94s]  even end up in some kind of court, getting yelled at by elected officials, having to pay fines,
[4669.94s -> 4676.52s]  hell, you might even have to apologize. Diversify who and what you shit on, though,
[4676.52s -> 4686.50s]  and you should be fine. Don't fuck around. What do we got? We still have some time on the trading
[4686.50s -> 4699.32s]  day. I got $535,000 in cash. What's beating up today? Aquafirma? Wouldn't it be interesting
[4699.32s -> 4710.01s]  if we did a $500,000 fucking long on Aquafirma and sent it to lobbyists? What do you think about
[4710.01s -> 4717.70s]  that? The price of water drops as production rises, but you send it to lobbyists and all
[4717.70s -> 4734.39s]  of a sudden, here you are. I want this to be a huge trade. More. More. I want at least $70,000.
[4735.43s -> 4749.91s]  All right, don't get greedy. Close it. Okay. Dark roast. The boiler says buy dark roast coffee.
[4749.91s -> 4758.36s]  I don't trust that person. Electronics are new, okay? Plastics, averages, foodstuff, electronics.
[4760.26s -> 4771.24s]  LWLodging. This is wood. AK-247. Munitions. This is pretty low. Look at this. Look at this fucking,
[4771.24s -> 4790.95s]  look at how ugly this chart is. Go all in. And send it to the lobbyists. I think that was doing it
[4790.95s -> 4802.78s]  already. I think this is LWLodging is down. Keep going. Oh, fuck. My public opinion meter. I can't
[4802.78s -> 4810.23s]  do that. I got to stop doing that, right? I'm just throwing lobbyists. All right, we're going to get
[4810.23s -> 4815.83s]  out of this trade. We're going to go to plastics. This is just daily information. Plastics going up.
[4816.39s -> 4829.56s]  $25,000 trade. How do I change my public opinion? Come on. I didn't put that much money in this.
[4831.80s -> 4838.92s]  Water is down a lot. Water is down a lot. So you know what we do. We wait for this to bottom out.
[4839.48s -> 4845.80s]  All right, this is a good trade. Let this bottom out and then I'm going to buy $500,000.
[4846.44s -> 4853.40s]  Bottom out. After this is done. Price of water drops as production rises. So look at how low
[4853.40s -> 4866.81s]  this is. It's going to go even lower. All right, sell that one. All right, water. And this is going
[4866.81s -> 4875.66s]  to be where we go in. At six. Look at this shit. Look at how bad this is doing. That's a pretty
[4875.66s -> 4890.81s]  bearish pennant, by the way. I know what that is. Come on. A little bit more. Oh, I'm going to turn
[4890.81s -> 4904.41s]  around. Water is going up. Go all in on every trade. Uno eats. Oh, get out, get out, get out,
[4904.41s -> 4918.17s]  get out, get out. Okay, I'm fine. I lost like 30 grand. This is going to be such a great place
[4918.17s -> 4923.80s]  to jump into water though. All in. It really is. Look at this. Look how bad this is. Just wait till
[4923.80s -> 4929.50s]  this is over. What time is it? All right, I'm going all in. The trading day is going to open
[4929.50s -> 4943.03s]  tomorrow. I'm going to go all in on water. Diversify your portfolio. No, not yet. This looks
[4943.03s -> 4955.91s]  like it's bottoming right now. Along on water. Hold on. Good thing I didn't. It's maybe now.
[4956.15s -> 4969.69s]  Does this look like a bottom? That's a confirmed bottom. Confirmed bottom. It's coming back. Oh,
[4969.69s -> 4983.13s]  fuck. Oh, no. Oh, no. No. How do I send in this shit? Send in the goddamn influencers. I don't
[4983.13s -> 4990.01s]  care. If people hate me, I'm fine. Hey, we're good. Everything's fine. Just send in the lobbyists.
[5000.42s -> 5011.18s]  Yeah, there we go. Water's doing just fine. Oh, discriminating lobbying reports?
[5015.45s -> 5031.93s]  Oh, public opinion is concerned. What do I do? What do I do? OK, I'm going to drive by car.
[5032.65s -> 5056.33s]  So I can't put these in the condos. All right, I got to be careful. Keep me in mind. Keep in mind.
[5058.07s -> 5067.69s]  I have like a $500,000 trade on water that I need to close tomorrow. I'm getting fired for
[5067.69s -> 5071.13s]  too much negative public attention to the firm. I got news for you fucking idiots. People hate us
[5071.13s -> 5077.02s]  anyways. Areos is just using this to get rid of me because you know what? That's none of your
[5077.02s -> 5081.90s]  fucking business. When it happens to you, believe me, you'll understand. In the meantime, you can
[5081.90s -> 5092.30s]  all get fucked. All right, man. You come out of curling next week? I don't want to find another
[5092.30s -> 5103.18s]  partner, man. All right, I got to keep that in mind. Shit starts to seriously hit the fan in
[5103.18s -> 5113.99s]  Balkador. Social media is going to be a dumpster fire. Can I take these? Can I steal their stuff?
[5114.79s -> 5136.98s]  Can I have this? This is mine. I guess I can just take them. All right, whatever.
[5137.78s -> 5145.74s]  PR disaster. All right, I got to make public opinion like me tomorrow.
[5145.74s -> 5157.46s]  Did you get fired? No, I didn't. Not yet. Steal office supplies. I don't need to steal
[5157.46s -> 5182.82s]  office supplies. Make a few TikToks for good PR. We need our apology video. People are being
[5182.82s -> 5186.18s]  cold to you. It's probably because you made it past probation and didn't do anything to celebrate.
[5187.14s -> 5190.90s]  But Corbin never even suggested it. What a stick in the mud. I'm going to tell you
[5191.62s -> 5196.28s]  more sometime today. The National News Network.
[5199.77s -> 5204.09s]  Entrances are running high in Balkador as news arrives that a bailout package will not be coming
[5204.09s -> 5209.45s]  for the distressed country, leaving many to assume that the worst is yet to come. Huge protests are
[5209.45s -> 5213.37s]  anticipated as the people of Balkador understand a deprivation that will surely follow the failure
[5213.37s -> 5218.65s]  of the bailout. Rumors are already circulating that northern oil and gas refineries will close
[5218.65s -> 5224.25s]  immediately. The lack of a bailout. All but insuring operational. Oh, the bell just rang.
[5224.25s -> 5229.58s]  Market's open. Everybody run to your desks. I got to go. I have a bunch of trades I have to make.
[5229.58s -> 5235.24s]  The news coming up next. I don't know. You're doing good, but you need to start thinking about
[5235.24s -> 5241.77s]  international bullshit. Currency values and all that. Pushing things in one state over another,
[5241.77s -> 5246.76s]  you know. In the end, it's all either worth something on any given day or it isn't, right?
[5247.40s -> 5251.70s]  But since we're talking about the fate of nations, they expect us to pretend we care.
[5252.34s -> 5256.58s]  You can treat countries like anything else, just remember that when they go up or down,
[5256.58s -> 5260.66s]  they can take a bunch of other stuff with them. Materials, products, and the rest of it.
[5261.30s -> 5265.34s]  Try lobbying them if you want to start making waves in several convenient places at once.
[5265.98s -> 5268.78s]  Shouldn't be rocket science by now. Later, trader.
[5271.91s -> 5275.83s]  As the value of a currency goes up or down, the value of companies which
[5275.83s -> 5278.31s]  come from the countries of those regions go up and down as well.
[5279.27s -> 5281.51s]  Okay.
[5282.39s -> 5290.44s]  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, my water. Water. Water going up. New safety standards
[5290.44s -> 5294.95s]  for water industry. Means that the numbers are going to go up on your screen.
[5295.59s -> 5304.97s]  No, no, don't sell. Why would I sell? Water's about to go up. Who owns this company?
[5305.53s -> 5314.79s]  Okay. The robo? All right, what we're going to do is we're going to...
[5315.67s -> 5319.56s]  Wait, wait, wait. Go back, go back, go back, go back. Where am I? I need to close this trade.
[5320.20s -> 5325.80s]  Sell it. No, not yet. Who owns this? Sell, sell, sell, sell. I don't know.
[5326.60s -> 5329.00s]  I just saw this thing on my screen. I don't know what just happened. FSU.
[5329.64s -> 5334.92s]  FSU is going to crash. The unit dollar is going down. I don't know what happened.
[5335.72s -> 5354.68s]  Make 50... I need to drink tea. Okay. Now I'm going to go back to my desk.
[5355.48s -> 5364.54s]  Let me slow this down. Biggest crackdown still coming. Northern coming back.
[5364.54s -> 5367.74s]  Behind the scenes, northern executives are furious about the protests.
[5367.74s -> 5370.46s]  Government's already making plans to wipe the protesters off the streets and
[5370.46s -> 5372.70s]  northern has agreed to bring in hundreds of workers from other countries.
[5373.66s -> 5391.46s]  Wait, what do you mean? The robo will surge at 1430? Northern coming back.
[5391.46s -> 5393.62s]  Okay. Northern, oil and gas. Check this shit out.
[5394.58s -> 5404.95s]  The robo is tanking. Check this out. We're going to make a ton of money.
[5410.68s -> 5422.92s]  And enter right now. 13, this shit's coming back. 1430. Hold it. I'm going to get fired.
[5422.92s -> 5438.26s]  How do I make PR? How do I do PR? I'm just going to wait. Should I jump on board of this?
[5438.98s -> 5450.36s]  Stop lobbying. All right. No more lobbying after this. Don't cheat.
[5450.36s -> 5456.10s]  I won't lobby anymore. I promise. New safety standards for water.
[5460.92s -> 5463.80s]  The currency crashed and then I jumped into the company that the currency is based on.
[5463.80s -> 5466.76s]  And then at 1430, this probably company is going to go up. That's what it said.
[5467.56s -> 5474.68s]  Starbucks going up. Buy Starnucks before the global collapse.
[5478.39s -> 5499.32s]  Global collapse? Oh, what time is it? Come on. I'll exit when it's at a thousand.
[5499.88s -> 5505.83s]  Clickbait? Well, I'll make some money on the clickbait.
[5506.55s -> 5519.35s]  Just do badly and the public opinion goes back up. All right. Almost there.
[5521.91s -> 5533.58s]  I'm doubling down. Double down. More. Keep it going. I want more.
[5534.46s -> 5540.70s]  All right. I'm going to get out of this trade. I'm ready to liquidate this.
[5541.34s -> 5547.75s]  Water's gone. I can't pay attention to that right now. What's going on?
[5549.22s -> 5554.25s]  Hey. Excuse me? What just happened? Did we just get hacked?
[5556.33s -> 5559.77s]  Stop. Leave me alone. Did everything go dark for a few seconds on your end just now?
[5559.77s -> 5562.17s]  It did over here. All right. I got a lot of money in this trade.
[5563.05s -> 5566.12s]  I know we have backup generators, so it wasn't the electricity.
[5566.84s -> 5571.46s]  Oh, well, probably nothing. Okay. Here comes the news.
[5575.75s -> 5578.07s]  Raggedy unfolds tonight in the democratic public of Balkador.
[5578.87s -> 5583.48s]  Really unemployed oil workers took to the streets.
[5583.48s -> 5586.28s]  Protests sudden closing of northern oil and gas refineries across the country.
[5587.00s -> 5593.99s]  Five police cracked down on the protests with brutal efficiency, killing as many
[5593.99s -> 5597.75s]  as 50 protesters, including in hundreds of people. Did I do that?
[5598.55s -> 5602.55s]  Easy balance followed the failure of Northern to secure a bail life from the Balkan government.
[5606.87s -> 5610.23s]  A bailout which could have prevented the violence that has at least the moment finally abated.
[5610.23s -> 5613.35s]  Oh my god. I sent to the lobbyists to make the cart. What did I do?
[5614.39s -> 5616.95s]  Sources tell us that the government and Northern were close to a bailout when
[5616.95s -> 5619.59s]  fierce opposition emerged from within the ruling party.
[5623.85s -> 5627.29s]  The newly revitalized opposition is claiming that a deal with Northern would have required
[5627.29s -> 5630.01s]  unacceptable cuts to vital social programs. What did I do?
[5632.33s -> 5636.41s]  Investor confidence in Northern has really barely been lower and will likely continue as the-
[5638.34s -> 5641.94s]  Oh, shit. We'll update you with more as the situation-
[5643.45s -> 5649.77s]  Get out. Okay. And then we're gonna- we're gonna go short.
[5651.42s -> 5666.17s]  Um, AK-247. Oh, she got out way too early. Fuck. Dark roasters coffee.
[5668.89s -> 5672.65s]  Are your condos worth 50 people, Jerry? God damn it.
[5679.00s -> 5681.72s]  I- hold on. I'm gonna be clean from now on.
[5682.36s -> 5687.56s]  Ooh, I need to make some more money on this. The FSU.
[5692.74s -> 5694.58s]  Okay, let's short the gas.
[5698.78s -> 5702.30s]  Jerry? It looks like it's gonna come down. I'm closing 60 minutes.
[5703.51s -> 5710.17s]  Coffee is up. Water- who else? Do they have water? It's just the earth drill dark roast coffee.
[5711.96s -> 5717.45s]  Buy it? I don't- no, I don't think so. I don't think I buy this. I think I short this.
[5718.17s -> 5722.46s]  Electronics going up. Who owns that? Is it electronics? It's coal.
[5722.46s -> 5727.75s]  Where's electronics? Soda? Coffee and plastic.
[5727.75s -> 5730.60s]  Electronics! The unit dollar's all over the-
[5731.00s -> 5733.08s]  B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B...
[5733.88s -> 5739.42s]  Unit dollar is the, uh, the Bocador currency, isn't it?
[5740.14s -> 5747.06s]  Huh? Unit dollar is the- is the currency.
[5747.62s -> 5754.09s]  Come on, go down. Go down, go down.
[5759.42s -> 5767.43s]  Oh, it's the ro- oh, shit. It's the robo.
[5768.15s -> 5779.38s]  Public opinion's back, it's okay.
[5782.26s -> 5785.58s]  Oh god. I was supposed to mention this to you at the time,
[5785.58s -> 5788.06s]  but the firm has a tradition that everybody who makes it past probation
[5788.06s -> 5789.74s]  is supposed to throw a party for everybody.
[5790.38s -> 5795.85s]  It isn't mandatory, but some of the brokers here believe that socializing outside of work
[5795.85s -> 5800.25s]  will determine how far you can go at the company. I wouldn't overestimate it, I've fired a lot of
[5800.25s -> 5805.32s]  popular losers. Regardless, you should see an interface in your terminal that will help you
[5805.32s -> 5824.62s]  plan it. Okay, organize a party. Party planned in condo. Getting up and just throwing a bust
[5824.62s -> 5835.42s]  at the vagasone's head. Oh my god. Jesus. Oh, I lost 50 grand on a unit dollar.
[5837.32s -> 5845.00s]  Members of the Ferio staff gather at your apartment for drinks before you head out on
[5845.00s -> 5853.06s]  the town for your night of bar crawling and whatever else. Several of your co-workers
[5853.06s -> 5857.72s]  remark on your- it sounds like a kid's birthday party. Several of your co-workers remark on your
[5857.72s -> 5861.16s]  latest acquisitions, taking care to quickly spin the conversation around a similar or better
[5861.16s -> 5866.26s]  things that they've recently purchased themselves. Before everybody heads out,
[5866.26s -> 5872.81s]  you take one last look around. Satisfied how- that got really quiet. Satisfied how impressed
[5872.81s -> 5880.46s]  everybody was. All of this is yours and you earned it. You shut the lights, lock the door,
[5880.46s -> 5894.94s]  and the rest of the night becomes a blur. Oh god. Everybody have fun at the party?
[5895.74s -> 5900.42s]  Worst part about how many people get fired here is not knowing what you're supposed to do with
[5900.42s -> 5905.06s]  them on social media. Should I stay connected with them? It's so awkward. One time one of them even
[5905.06s -> 5908.82s]  wrote me and was all like, I think you're so talented, it was so amazing to work with you.
[5909.70s -> 5914.10s]  They think I can get them to a job back just because of who my family is? Honestly it's so
[5914.10s -> 5927.56s]  rude. I hate it. Take responsibility for your own life. Hello? I thought I told you when you get
[5927.56s -> 5933.29s]  these challenges you're getting them for a reason. You're intentionally ignoring them because you're
[5933.29s -> 5937.37s]  bitter and nobody is filling you in on the strategy. You might be too emotional for this job.
[5938.33s -> 5942.81s]  You see me giving a fuck? No you don't. Because I get paid either way and that's all that matters.
[5943.53s -> 5946.81s]  And so do you. Just stop fucking around, follow the orders so we can get rich,
[5946.81s -> 5954.63s]  get the fuck out of here and never look back. Do you have any idea? What the hell?
[5957.70s -> 5968.57s]  Nice streamer setup. You don't need this many monitors. Three. I have four but that's because
[5968.57s -> 5980.50s]  I wanted the fourth one. I have an open trade. In what? Oh! Dark roast coffee we need to send
[5980.50s -> 5993.88s]  the lobbyist in. Send in the lobbyist. I just lost everything. Send in the lobbyist, short it down.
[5994.68s -> 6001.78s]  I need coffee to go down. I need coffee to go down. Down, down, down, down, down.
[6001.78s -> 6007.54s]  Hurry, hurry, hurry. Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Go, go, go, go, go,
[6007.54s -> 6023.70s]  more! Crush it! You said no more lobbyists. Yeah but I had to. I'm gonna get destroyed.
[6024.50s -> 6036.33s]  Get munitions price 11% lower? Okay I'm gonna get out of here with a $38,000 loss.
[6039.19s -> 6050.20s]  Oh, what do you think? Wait, should I just take the loss? I'm taking the loss, whatever.
[6050.20s -> 6062.81s]  I have $620,000, fine. Okay munitions. 11% lower, that's all I had to do. Here it is,
[6062.81s -> 6068.76s]  we have coal now, okay. What's this? New carbohydrate research sparks intensified food
[6068.76s -> 6081.06s]  stuff lobby. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Oil going up. Unexpected demand for oil chokes existing
[6081.06s -> 6089.82s]  supply raising price too late. I missed plastics. Did I though? What about the, what about the soda
[6089.82s -> 6098.73s]  company? FSU going up. The FSU dollar. Soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda.
[6099.37s -> 6109.82s]  Hold it. Oh my god. Oh my god, the soda and double, I've got double whammy'd here.
[6110.46s -> 6116.81s]  I got triple whammy'd here. Soda, soda, soda announces new brand and their currency went up.
[6122.23s -> 6129.72s]  I should have went, well I should have went all in. I'm gonna hold this one. Get munitions lower.
[6129.80s -> 6138.73s]  How am I gonna do that? Although plastics is really killing this. Not yet. Hold on.
[6143.24s -> 6150.02s]  And get out now. Okay, what do we got? Munitions have got to go lower. Lobby it down.
[6150.74s -> 6166.70s]  Oh then soda, still doing well. Is it still going up? Throughout munitions companies? I,
[6167.34s -> 6172.46s]  all right, all right, I'll get, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in. All right, I'm in.
[6179.00s -> 6183.42s]  Lobby everything. I can't do that. All right, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out. That was a bad trade. I'm out.
[6184.22s -> 6189.03s]  Electronics going down. Strong economic performance in Volcador. Dark roast coffee, let's go.
[6189.75s -> 6201.42s]  I need, now we need a, we need coffee to go up. Come on, give me, give me a coffee right here.
[6201.42s -> 6219.67s]  Coffee going up. Munitions have to keep going down. Ken, drop it. 10k on this one right here.
[6220.47s -> 6230.04s]  Ooh, nice. Munitions is, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, what, what's going on? Munitions,
[6230.04s -> 6236.28s]  shortage of munitions. Oh my god, what happened? Did I get it? Did I get in?
[6237.00s -> 6250.98s]  All right, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out. Okay, I'm good. I have $642,000.
[6252.02s -> 6259.51s]  What's coming up next? I feel like I'm watching somebody's job that I don't understand at all.
[6267.93s -> 6275.38s]  Get tea? Coal, coal, coal, coal, coal. Who has coal? Who has coal? This drilling company does.
[6283.40s -> 6288.25s]  Electronics going down. Coal going up. Plastics going down. Munitions going up.
[6289.80s -> 6298.20s]  Whoa, what happened? What the fuck just happened? Why'd they do that? Coal's supposed to be going
[6298.20s -> 6306.90s]  up. Rising protection has been coal producing. Did this guy just get dumped on? Who dumped that
[6306.90s -> 6326.39s]  shit on me? What was that? Read the news? There's an enemy lobbyist. You want to play that game?
[6326.39s -> 6343.22s]  Fine. We'll play that game. Bring it back up. Imagine seeing this chart. I feel like what the
[6343.22s -> 6362.89s]  fuck is happening? What is happening? Oh no, I didn't sell. What just happened? Emergency PR
[6363.77s -> 6390.92s]  minus 25% for a new car. I'll take it. What'd I get? I can sell these? 90? 100? I made money.
[6392.26s -> 6408.86s]  Lease your first condo. I think I should probably sell my first condo. Put them in the condo. Okay,
[6409.82s -> 6414.94s]  where's the most expensive one? This is a $90,000 car. I'm putting it in this condo.
[6415.91s -> 6423.90s]  Holy shit, I can lease this for $14,000 a day? What if I put two cars in here? Oh my god, yeah.
[6425.42s -> 6449.46s]  Holy shit. Okay, I'll take it. This is my condo. One day's of cleaning remaining. What's that mean?
[6450.26s -> 6459.18s]  Why do I hate chat? I have to close that. What trade do I have open right now? I don't even
[6459.18s -> 6475.03s]  remember. Oh, the party. Okay. Oh, all right. I gotta be ready to get the hell out of coal.
[6478.18s -> 6480.98s]  Understand that the more you screw up, the more difficult it becomes to make it look like a
[6480.98s -> 6485.86s]  misunderstanding. Public opinion is a complex thing. A spectacular amount of time and money
[6485.86s -> 6491.40s]  is invested into expressing it within a single metric on your dashboard. We do this so you can
[6491.40s -> 6495.72s]  focus on making money. We also do it so you have no excuses whatsoever if you screw up.
[6496.76s -> 6500.84s]  I guess why I'm standing here. That's right, you screwed it up. If you can't conduct business
[6500.84s -> 6504.84s]  profitably without dragging Ferrios through the mud, we will find somebody who can. Now get out
[6504.84s -> 6514.98s]  of here. I think I got my one screw up that I'm allowed, like Super Mario life. Well, somebody
[6515.86s -> 6521.30s]  anti-lobbied me. I lobbied and then they lobbied me back. It wasn't... I bought the price. They
[6521.30s -> 6534.26s]  lobbied me down, so I lobbied them back. Yeah, I'm thinking about going back to school. I've always
[6534.26s -> 6538.98s]  been interested in marine biology or maybe jungle biology. I know it isn't all about cute animals,
[6538.98s -> 6543.70s]  but I do love orangutans and their scrunched up little faces. They've hurt the earth so much.
[6543.70s -> 6547.22s]  The least we can do is save the animals. Trust me, you don't even want to know how cruel people
[6547.22s -> 6558.54s]  can be to them. Makes me sick. I have to get this trade ready to close. I can't talk to anybody
[6558.54s -> 6563.10s]  right now. Okay, where am I? Okay, this has to sell immediately when the market opens.
[6566.04s -> 6589.42s]  I can't... I just gotta go. Good. Good. Oh, man. Oh, man. Okay. Okay. All right. This is looking good.
[6592.15s -> 6602.18s]  Okay. Nice. I'm happy about it. Electronics going up. Close it. Or should we wait for it?
[6602.18s -> 6608.36s]  We wait for something to do with coal. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Coal's gonna go up.
[6609.16s -> 6614.20s]  It's gonna be a big thing with coal. Plastics. Come on. FSU. Come on. FSU is not this one.
[6615.72s -> 6622.18s]  Why you got... That's me. All right. I'll take the 100 grand. What we got? In one neighborhood,
[6622.18s -> 6638.89s]  a coffee com service. I need to speak to coffee. Slow it down. I'm almost at a million dollars.
[6644.12s -> 6649.08s]  Lobby more? No, I'm not going to lobby at all today. I need to read this.
[6651.08s -> 6654.60s]  So in one neighborhood, a coffee com service is following years of protests over gentrification.
[6654.60s -> 6657.96s]  Residents of one small community seem to finally be accepting the presence of Star Nux,
[6658.68s -> 6662.20s]  a chain in which they once held solar spots for the end of the beloved local coffee stand. Sam's
[6662.20s -> 6667.08s]  coffee meant a lot to us, but I guess they wore us down. Sam died a few years after they drove
[6667.08s -> 6673.18s]  him out of the business, too, and he had been the one who was really leading the fight. New
[6673.18s -> 6678.46s]  rifle ammo design poised to shake up munitions industry. Deathblossom, a new type of ammunition
[6679.10s -> 6683.42s]  with the popular RAE-27 semi-automatic rifles renewing the efforts of lobbyists against
[6683.42s -> 6692.94s]  the munitions industry, who insist to be taken off store shelves. AK-247 stock surges if free
[6692.94s -> 6701.08s]  state citizen stockpile ammunition. Okay. We're going to play the... Oh, never mind. We're not
[6701.08s -> 6706.49s]  going to play that today. All right. Let me look at the daily chart. Let's take a look around.
[6706.49s -> 6718.60s]  Soda, plastic. FSU is up. Lodging, gas is down. Water is way down. Green grocers are doing a fight.
[6719.96s -> 6728.26s]  I think I'm going to make a water play here. I think I'm going to go for water.
[6736.89s -> 6743.62s]  I would have bought this. I wonder if I should just short this.
[6747.08s -> 6768.04s]  FSU dollar is overrated. What? Get a trade in, you fucking idiot. This is coming crashing down.
[6768.04s -> 6776.54s]  I didn't even have to lobby. I just waited for the dollar to be bad. Is that bottoming out?
[6782.63s -> 6801.16s]  The good thing I got out of coffee. Bottom is zero. Foodstuffs going up. Close this trade.
[6803.64s -> 6813.96s]  Foodstuffs going up. This is not foodstuffs. Get out. Where's foodstuffs?
[6819.83s -> 6823.03s]  You shorted, not longed. That's all right. I got $698,000.
[6824.23s -> 6829.80s]  Currencies. How's this doing? All right. Get the Democratic Republic of Baccalaureate price 11%
[6829.80s -> 6850.98s]  higher. And then some lobbyists. Let's go in on oil and gas. This is good to me. Here we go. Nice.
[6851.62s -> 6862.44s]  I'm not going to use lobbyists. Well, it told me I had to. Stop lobbying. Get the price 11% higher.
[6862.44s -> 6875.37s]  I can't do that. I can only do that with a lobbyist. It's almost there. I'm almost done.
[6875.93s -> 6890.74s]  Come on. A little more. A little more. Come on. A little more. Have the currency go up a little
[6890.74s -> 6913.29s]  higher. Only two more cents. Come on. No. There we go. There it goes. Take up higher. I wonder
[6913.29s -> 6921.83s]  if this game is awakening any future traders. The markets are fucking terrifying. Be careful.
[6922.71s -> 6931.94s]  Almost there. All right. Sell that. All right. Now I just need the currency to go up a little more.
[6934.39s -> 6942.90s]  The FSU is down. Coffee is down. Come on. Come on. I just get a... One more time. That's it. I
[6942.90s -> 6966.54s]  promise. All right. Go. I promised. I know I promised, but I promise. Whatever. Invest before
[6966.54s -> 6972.14s]  you lobby. Yeah. Otherwise, I'm chasing the price too. All right. Sell it. Okay. All right. I got
[6972.14s -> 6985.51s]  $738,000. Munitions going down. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. Keep going. Munitions
[6985.51s -> 6997.16s]  down. The FSU up. Oh my God. Get out. Holy shit. Did I get out? Thank God. All right. I probably
[6997.16s -> 7010.78s]  just lost the game. All right. What's the play here? I think I'm going to short this at the top
[7010.78s -> 7020.31s]  here. Look at how bad this looks. Starnux is up. Green grocery is up. Coffee. Probably maybe coffee.
[7021.11s -> 7039.66s]  We know Eats. I don't know what's the play here. What's the play? I mean the top. Pepe left. I mean
[7040.62s -> 7051.43s]  this is going down. This is going down. I'm in. A nice pop. This shit's tanking. The FSU is just
[7051.43s -> 7056.79s]  the public finance. Financial crisis. The Free State Union casts fear. Lots of fear here. Munitions
[7056.79s -> 7061.27s]  are not doing well. Price of munitions drop as production rise. A lot of bullshit going on here.
[7061.27s -> 7068.79s]  That was a nice little pop, but it's not going to last. Munitions are dead. The munitions are done.
[7068.79s -> 7082.86s]  It's over. Any second now. People seem to be not believing that. People don't really care.
[7083.50s -> 7102.95s]  It's losing traction. Drop. Just drop. 32 is the new floor, old man. We'll see. Here we go.
[7103.51s -> 7113.54s]  Here it comes. Here comes the really bad news. Bad news incoming. Really bad news coming up.
[7116.86s -> 7120.22s]  Yeah, you thought that? That was a bull trap is what we call it here in the office.
[7120.78s -> 7133.99s]  This is a bull trap. Watch this. No, yeah. You got nothing. Come on.
[7133.99s -> 7146.20s]  Come on. I'm not sending any... And there it is. There's the bull trap. Trap set. There it is.
[7146.20s -> 7162.41s]  Goodbye. Told you it was a bull trap. You're finished. Come on. Get this. I don't want likes.
[7162.41s -> 7166.89s]  Government of FSU is spending large amounts of money to fuel unrestricted. Yeah, let's go.
[7168.84s -> 7181.37s]  Yeah, goodbye. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Thank you.
[7183.05s -> 7193.05s]  No, no. What is this stock doing? Go down. Go down. I'm not closing this until
[7193.05s -> 7206.31s]  below 30. There we go. See? See? It's bottoming out. I don't think so. This has still got a lot
[7206.31s -> 7223.75s]  of traction in the news here. Below 30, I'm telling you. This game is bad for chat.
[7224.55s -> 7228.74s]  Everyone's getting invested. There we go. All right. Now I'm going to... I'll close it now.
[7230.58s -> 7240.22s]  Right now. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Under 30, I told you. All right. Oh, this is not... This
[7240.22s -> 7248.25s]  does not look good. Okay. I'm out. I'm out. All right. Now I'm out for real.
[7249.29s -> 7259.38s]  I'm out. Now for real. In 10 seconds. Now. Okay. Done. Okay. Good. This game sucks. This
[7259.38s -> 7263.62s]  game does not suck. This game is fun. I've been looking for a stock market game like this
[7265.90s -> 7268.54s]  six, seven, eight months ago. Remember we talking about wanting a game like this?
[7269.26s -> 7282.30s]  Oh, I wanted it so bad. Okay. All right. I'm going to... Let's go get... Markets are closing
[7282.30s -> 7303.90s]  anyways. I did it good for the day. Speed this back up. This game is slot machines with graphs.
[7304.78s -> 7329.40s]  I mean, that's just the stock market. You just described the stock market. The stock market is
[7329.40s -> 7336.52s]  just a shitload of people, like 50 people all hovering around the roulette table, all screaming
[7336.52s -> 7341.08s]  the numbers that they're playing and arguing with each other as to why you should play certain
[7341.08s -> 7349.78s]  numbers. It's just roulette table with like 100 people at the table. All right. Fire. I won.
[7350.42s -> 7363.35s]  Another person down. No evidence was disclosed today. I didn't lobby that much. Get some cash
[7363.35s -> 7374.14s]  here. Holy shit. Should I get another condo? Should I get maybe another car? Should I buy
[7374.14s -> 7390.02s]  another one? Words on the screen make no sense to me. It makes sense. Hey, they make sense to me.
[7390.90s -> 7407.08s]  I know what I'm doing. I organize a condo party. No, I'm good for the day. After these condos,
[7407.08s -> 7417.37s]  I don't even have furniture. Peter Griffin trading stocks. Put stuff in the condo. Yeah. You
[7417.37s -> 7426.44s]  know what? I can't. They're already there. I have to buy stuff. It's $80,000 to buy furniture. I
[7426.44s -> 7452.74s]  can't. How do I leave? I don't leave? Oh, I didn't click go home. Oh, okay. I like this game. This
[7452.74s -> 7462.78s]  game is good. This is fun. I like this. Oh, I don't need this shit right now. You can't be really
[7462.78s -> 7469.58s]  serious about Furious letting me go. Because everybody I beat was some nobody's shit face
[7469.58s -> 7474.06s]  analyst. I've been working for years. I've been loyal to you for years. Please leave the building
[7474.06s -> 7480.70s]  calmly. I'll have security meet you on the ground floor. Congratulations on your promotion to
[7480.70s -> 7487.78s]  associate. I might say that you've made it through your real probation period. The vast majority of
[7487.78s -> 7492.86s]  our analysts never make it as far as you have. You need to prove yourself and we may promote you to
[7492.86s -> 7496.46s]  vice president. At that point, you'll get a taste of what it really means to be part of a firm like
[7496.46s -> 7512.06s]  Furious. Vice president. Vice president. Holy shit. I've been here for five days. That's a psycho.
[7516.47s -> 7526.63s]  Whoa, that was weird. I think is the game saving? Hopefully the game has been saving.
[7532.25s -> 7540.73s]  Law and disorder. This is insane, Lois. Yeah, it reminds me of the time I sent GME to the moon.
[7544.66s -> 7549.11s]  Where do you think you're going? What are you even doing here? We're executing a search warrant.
[7549.11s -> 7552.87s]  Knowing what you know, I'm sure you can expect charges to follow shortly. What?
[7553.91s -> 7556.95s]  Oh, I don't even think about going anywhere else. The passports of every employee of this
[7556.95s -> 7569.10s]  firm have been flagged. Get lost. What are you talking about? Hey, don't touch my computer.
[7569.90s -> 7602.78s]  What the hell? The firm is going to prison. This is scripted. Welcome to the show. Good morning.
[7602.78s -> 7607.18s]  I'm glad we're all able to take a bit of time off even if it was unexpected. Did you meet Walker yet?
[7607.18s -> 7611.66s]  I hear she's your new rival. Ignore her if she starts talking nonsense. She's not an intellectual.
[7611.66s -> 7616.62s]  She's hallucinating. They tried to ban hard drugs here for a while to keep the coke under control.
[7617.26s -> 7621.74s]  Who knew we would end up with a person on some kind of experimental LSD meth ketamine combo instead?
[7622.54s -> 7626.22s]  I don't care how good it makes her at math or computers or whatever. Between you and me,
[7626.22s -> 7635.90s]  not worth it. They're a psycho and not the cool kind. Do you play anything else besides solitaire?
[7635.90s -> 7641.82s]  Holy shit, that's so boring. If you think you've got any chance at getting that VP position over me,
[7641.82s -> 7645.50s]  you're even crazier than I am. Understand something? I don't sleep, I don't eat and
[7645.50s -> 7650.94s]  drink intravenously. I live in the algorithm. I see the constellations, the data of everything
[7650.94s -> 7655.26s]  everywhere. I'm ready for the future. You don't even have one. Now get out of my fucking face.
[7659.72s -> 7666.70s]  All right, the trading is on. Let's go. Violence continues to spread across the
[7666.70s -> 7670.06s]  Democratic Republic of Balkador with many saying that the country is now on the brink of full-scale
[7670.06s -> 7678.41s]  civil war. Really? Well, government representatives deny that foodstuffs, foodstuffs, foodstuffs, and
[7678.41s -> 7682.57s]  livestock, and foodstuffs, and livestock. Where is it? Foodstuffs, and livestock, and
[7682.57s -> 7687.05s]  livestock, and foodstuffs. Where is it? I don't know where it is. I'm so late to this trade.
[7687.93s -> 7699.72s]  Uno eats infinity mart. Holy shit, this is expensive. I missed it. The euro. Chaos in
[7699.72s -> 7716.65s]  the market. I need to drink fucking tea. God damn it. Slow it down. Let's go. Ammunition.
[7717.29s -> 7728.30s]  Weapons will surge this afternoon. Yeah, I know. I need weapons, products, weapons.
[7729.67s -> 7743.40s]  Missiles. We're going big on missiles. Arms dealing. No, I'm buying weapons. Buy, then sell,
[7743.40s -> 7752.44s]  then buy again. God damn it. Leave me alone. We need you to start taking long-term positions
[7752.44s -> 7757.98s]  in some of the companies the firm is dealing with. I've unlocked the ability for your terminal to
[7757.98s -> 7762.79s]  start collecting dividends. Dividends, you will generate ongoing revenue from the stock of any
[7762.79s -> 7769.88s]  company you've bought on a regular basis. It's our piece of their profit, so make sure you pick
[7769.88s -> 7774.74s]  companies that are making one. Dividends can be far more lucrative over time than constantly
[7774.74s -> 7779.85s]  trying to guess which way the market is going. Especially if you have confidence that a company,
[7779.85s -> 7784.09s]  a weapons manufacturer, for example, is going to continue to grow and do well because of some kind
[7784.09s -> 7788.49s]  of event. You're in the big leagues now. If you stubbornly hold onto the wrong company for a long
[7788.49s -> 7797.61s]  time, the results can be catastrophic. Weigh your options carefully. Buy. Missile Tech AG. Sign the
[7797.61s -> 7802.33s]  dividend agreement. The position will earn expected dividends at market closure every day, but cannot
[7802.33s -> 7811.38s]  be liquidated until you pay the penalty fee. Well, that's $700,000 and that's all my money.
[7811.94s -> 7825.32s]  I don't have any money. All right, missiles are going up. Buy. Wait. How many do I have?
[7825.32s -> 7842.89s]  $710,000? How do I have $970,000 here? I have $1.46 million in that. Oh my goodness gracious.
[7845.11s -> 7861.16s]  I've signed the dividend agreement. Every single cent I own is in this. Okay, this afternoon it's
[7861.16s -> 7869.99s]  going to pop. Here it goes. Oh my God. What should I do? I have $1.7 million. What should I do?
[7870.79s -> 7880.73s]  This is huge. Did I pay the penalty to take millions of dollars? Hold it. Should I hold it?
[7882.17s -> 7897.34s]  This is $1.9 million. Lobby it now? Oh my God. I can't. I have just weapons. All right. I did
[7897.34s -> 7901.10s]  it. I did it. Now I'm going to liquidate it. I'm going to take $2.3 million. Oh my God. This is a
[7901.10s -> 7921.99s]  big mistake. This is a mistake. $2 million. $2.1 million. Euric dominion? The euro's overvalued.
[7921.99s -> 7929.32s]  Is this euro? No. Should I hold it? Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Is this civil war happening?
[7929.32s -> 7938.44s]  Yeah, but this is $2.5 million. You won't get the dividend if you sell it. Oh man.
[7942.36s -> 7946.94s]  Weapons are surging. Hold for the dividend. Hold for the dividend.
[7951.93s -> 7954.49s]  It's going to come down though. All right. I'm going to pretend it doesn't exist.
[7957.75s -> 7969.19s]  You need to have diamond hands. Countries of Sienna. Sienna is this company. Sienna's not
[7969.19s -> 7988.39s]  doing well at all. Sell now. Jesus. Should I? I missed the dividend. This is $100,000 in dividend.
[7995.48s -> 8006.42s]  Plastics going. No. It's okay. It's $2.2 million still. It's all right. I have to hold this to the
[8006.42s -> 8018.97s]  end of the day. Okay. Now I'm going to... What the fuck just happened? Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
[8018.97s -> 8028.92s]  What do you mean weapons down? Regulation of the weapons industry is ongoing. Get out. $2.1 million.
[8031.61s -> 8042.50s]  Sell. Sell. Sell. I have $1.8 million. I'm good. I thought I sold it. I thought I sold it. No. I
[8042.50s -> 8050.92s]  got out of the dividend agreement. Okay. Get back in. I have $1.8 million. All right. Let me...
[8050.92s -> 8064.89s]  I'm going to get back in. You sold the bottom. I did, didn't I? All right. $500,000. Lock that up
[8064.89s -> 8080.42s]  as a dividend. Sign the dividend agreement. I have $1.3 million now to play with. Southern soda.
[8081.58s -> 8093.42s]  Long. Southern soda smells like blood. Wait. Why is that a good thing? I just bought on the news.
[8093.42s -> 8112.39s]  What? Why is that a good thing? It smells like blood. Southern soda. Beverages are up too.
[8112.39s -> 8119.21s]  Look at this. This is going to be good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I got my dividends coming in.
[8119.85s -> 8133.58s]  Who the heck likes on the news about how real it is? I mean, that's like... That looks pretty...
[8134.30s -> 8137.98s]  That smell is more than money. It's blood. Buy southern soda with everything you got. Why?
[8139.02s -> 8149.10s]  Why would you want to have something smell like blood? I'm thinking of closing this.
[8153.19s -> 8159.59s]  Do you guys remember that time when Chuck E. Cheese came to the stream
[8161.13s -> 8167.62s]  and when I showed the me kissing Chuck E. Cheese picture, this stock price went down by like 5%
[8167.62s -> 8183.19s]  or something? Didn't that actually happen? That's so stupid. I don't think it was related at all,
[8183.19s -> 8186.39s]  but somebody brought it up. They were like, hey dude, I like did some math and I did a little
[8186.39s -> 8191.27s]  thing. I kind of did some timing here. This is when he appeared on your stream and this is
[8191.27s -> 8199.26s]  what their stock value was. And this is when you showed the kiss. It's like, no, that's not accurate.
[8199.26s -> 8206.97s]  That's just nothing. That doesn't mean anything. I'm out. That was good trade. 1.4 million. What do
[8206.97s -> 8216.33s]  I got here? How is it? How's the missiles doing? What do you have weapons? All right. Missiles.
[8220.15s -> 8231.45s]  I have to hold it for the dividend. What's going on with Starnox? Plastic going up.
[8232.60s -> 8236.04s]  I only got like a few more minutes in the trading day. All right. So what I'm going to do is I'm
[8236.04s -> 8242.12s]  going to... Let's go all in. Let's go all in. I'm going to... I'm going to make that even up. You
[8242.12s -> 8251.50s]  know what? Market's closed. I'm going to get my dividend. This guy's negative 18,000. He
[8251.50s -> 8271.93s]  fucked up big time. It's okay. I got 200 grand. Should I buy some more cars? Sell for $187,000?
[8276.31s -> 8292.46s]  I think I'm just going to do that. That's 200 grand. I can buy a house now. Buy a house. Market
[8292.46s -> 8299.56s]  value. Decoration slots. Oh my goodness. Okay. Hold on a minute. I'm going to... This is going
[8299.56s -> 8306.81s]  to make me a shitload of money. I'm going to sell this house for $83,000 and then I'm going to buy
[8306.81s -> 8329.19s]  some cars. Oh yeah. Come on. I'll check this shit out. $28,000 a day. $34,000 a day. $37,000 a day
[8329.19s -> 8337.19s]  from this house. This is currently... But who's even taking this? All right. I'm going to sell
[8337.19s -> 8344.94s]  this one. Don't need to... We're buying houses now. I need to buy paintings. Oh, I need a million
[8344.94s -> 8353.38s]  dollars. Now lease the house. Not yet. Not yet. Hold on. Because I need more decorations and shit.
[8353.38s -> 8361.19s]  Designer chair. I'm going to buy... Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. Ready? Check this out.
[8361.91s -> 8374.84s]  I'm selling this. I am now going to buy a furniture loot box. Okay. Sofa. Going in the house.
[8375.64s -> 8383.30s]  $38,000 a day. Designer chair. $38,000. A bear statue. Lease it for almost $39,000 a day.
[8383.94s -> 8389.94s]  I just spent a bunch of money. That's okay. This is where I live. I live here.
[8390.66s -> 8394.87s]  Wait. Do I even have a house? Wait. I don't have a house.
[8397.40s -> 8410.14s]  Shit. What do I do? I need to live somewhere. I sold my house? I have to live at work now?
[8410.78s -> 8428.18s]  Buy another condo. I need to live here. Buy another condo. Okay. This is where I live.
[8428.74s -> 8439.53s]  I got fired. I'm not going to be getting fired for organizing a union when I explicitly said
[8439.53s -> 8444.17s]  that it was not what I was doing. All I want to do is make all of you think of yourselves
[8444.17s -> 8447.29s]  as important stakeholders in the business of people who get paid to show up here.
[8448.01s -> 8451.05s]  If all of us felt that way, imagine the things we could accomplish and the profits we might be
[8451.05s -> 8456.66s]  entitled to. Far more profits than anyone in any kind of failed communist state would know
[8456.66s -> 8460.90s]  anything about. I know that much. Sadly, you're all too foolish to see. You don't deserve me.
[8460.90s -> 8473.29s]  Nobody deserves me. Fuck you. Fuck you all. How many people work here still? Okay. It's just me
[8473.85s -> 8480.89s]  and the human computer. How did you do today? Leave me alone. Working shitty uppers. Fuck.
[8482.02s -> 8487.46s]  I want to know what you did today. Ten million in your account. Down one million.
[8489.61s -> 8500.12s]  Down $275,000 today. I wonder who's going to get the promotion to VP. Unionize your
[8500.12s -> 8504.44s]  workplace just gave ten community subs. I bet you're wondering how it could be that this
[8504.44s -> 8510.14s]  place was drowning in TIC agents two days ago. And yet now everything is back to being exactly
[8510.14s -> 8514.71s]  the way it was. On top of that, dead silence from everyone. Not as much as a word about it.
[8515.35s -> 8519.27s]  I see everybody playing it smart. Silence is golden, they figure. Hey, if everything's fine,
[8519.27s -> 8523.51s]  I don't need to know anything. You don't need to worry either. Just say the interests of our
[8523.51s -> 8527.99s]  government and Farios are overlapping at the moment and not only the way they usually do.
[8528.71s -> 8532.63s]  For some of the people with access to Geissnet and put two and two together, but they should
[8532.63s -> 8540.94s]  know better than anyone to not say a word. Or you do too. Also, I missed ten community subs from
[8541.02s -> 8550.54s]  Onomos and Lenny the Person. Thanks both of you for your ten subs. Wait, aren't these everyone
[8550.54s -> 8559.69s]  that got fired? Resent them for trying to make everybody else look bad by doing it.
[8559.69s -> 8563.21s]  Before long, you realize it makes sense, especially the cleaners who tried to make it feel like it was
[8563.21s -> 8568.41s]  all a dream. It also seems to be easy to impress everybody as a host when you've got a staff at
[8568.41s -> 8573.05s]  your beck and call. The bartenders and waiters go out of their way to make it clear that this is your
[8573.05s -> 8578.01s]  party in a way that makes you understand they've done this many times before. Everybody loves you
[8578.01s -> 8582.25s]  and tells you this is the best party they've ever been to. Before long, everybody will be doing this
[8582.89s -> 8599.32s]  and try to enjoy it. Blackout. You look so tensed lately, maybe you should take some time off.
[8599.96s -> 8604.20s]  I always like to say, spoiler yourself, you deserve it. Taking a two-year backpacking
[8604.20s -> 8608.44s]  sabbatical after college was the best thing I ever did. I learned so much about the world
[8608.44s -> 8612.04s]  just by going to places and really letting myself be there. Come by sometime and I'll
[8612.04s -> 8621.06s]  show you the pictures. I know how boring it can seem, but dividends work. It can't be rip and
[8621.06s -> 8625.94s]  run, buy, and sell bullshit all the time. It makes sense now and then to check in for the long haul
[8625.94s -> 8630.50s]  when you're dealing with things that will never change. Yesterday you fucked up. You should have
[8630.50s -> 8635.30s]  taken the dividends and respected the play. You're watching the news right? I'm sure you can figure
[8635.30s -> 8639.06s]  out that this is bigger than either of us now. When you eat shit like this you make it seem like
[8639.06s -> 8644.66s]  you can't see the bigger picture. Start seeing it. What's wrong with this person? Like how about like
[8644.66s -> 8649.06s]  I do make my own trades and you like look I want if I want to buy like star nucks I'm just gonna
[8649.06s -> 8663.43s]  buy it like what the who cares leave me alone tea drink tea save civil war on the democratic

[8668.23s -> 8673.35s]  and other global powers calling for peace of course on the ground so just that sudden escalation of
[8673.35s -> 8676.47s]  hostilities have been tied to poorly trained rebel troops getting access to increasingly heavy
[8676.47s -> 8688.81s]  weaponry 23 people attended the party in your condo what what i get long i'm long on this one
[8689.37s -> 8694.63s]  i believe is it defended wait wait wait wait hold on wait the dominion and the free state union

[8766.23s -> 8772.20s]  worth paying attention to this is hacktivism nonsense is nothing but extortion we received
[8772.20s -> 8776.52s]  the ransom note moments after all this started happening the it department will figure it out
[8777.40s -> 8781.64s]  it becomes the most pragmatic course of action we will pay after all we can always find the money
[8781.64s -> 8786.60s]  in the salaries of the it employees will be catapulted into the fucking moon if they do not

[9309.88s -> 9315.08s]  cyber security what he called us to investigate but a hack that massive attracts attention regardless
[9316.04s -> 9319.24s]  seems like your people are getting it under control but i'm sure it makes you think about things
[9320.12s -> 9324.76s]  a bunch of teenagers in the middle of nowhere can hit ferrios like this if you're not as untouchable
[9324.76s -> 9329.80s]  as you think you are and i'm letting everybody know they can reach out to the trade and investment

[11386.04s -> 11390.36s]  agency to deal with your fine and you become a confidential informant to the trade and investment
[11391.32s -> 11395.91s]  this is not a negotiation you can help us take them down or you can take the fall yourself

[11463.82s -> 11470.60s]  just like anyone but ask yourself this if they're really all so so powerful do you think they'll
[11470.60s -> 11474.20s]  give a second thought to sacrificing you the moment that you become an inconvenience
[11475.08s -> 11480.87s]  do you think they got to where they are by rewarding loyalty even when it hurts well i
[11480.87s -> 11491.14s]  guess it's all rhetorical at this point i guess you're going to find out i made so much money
[11491.14s -> 11496.34s]  for you i made so much money before court resumes i would like to apologize to the jury for the
[11496.34s -> 11502.26s]  substantial delays involved in this case numerous motions filed by council on both sides have
[11502.26s -> 11507.78s]  created unnecessary hindrances and this court has already had to give several citations for contempt
[11507.78s -> 11513.62s]  let me be clear any further attempts to administratively obstruct justice in
[11513.62s -> 11521.53s]  these proceedings will result in prison and disbarment have i understood yes your honor
[11521.53s -> 11527.13s]  yes your honor good because of the media attention surrounding these events it has been necessary to
[11527.13s -> 11533.45s]  sequester our new jury for several months however we are now prepared to proceed the prosecution
[11533.45s -> 11540.31s]  has called the vice president of ferrios capital management to testify average head phd just gave
[11540.31s -> 11548.81s]  50 community subs holy shit thanks for the 50 subs sub city that's right thanks a lot that's

[11557.35s -> 11561.43s]  a result of the overwhelming evidence against you over the past several months you've made
[11561.43s -> 11567.56s]  substantial use of a dark web communication tool known as geiss net isn't where i do like the like
[11567.56s -> 11574.92s]  move my arms around like put my eyes rolling back my head i don't know what what is that for
[11574.92s -> 11578.04s]  this tool you were able to gain access to privileged information that enabled you to
[11578.04s -> 11581.40s]  act on a legal foreknowledge of the movement of several markets do you admit to it
[11584.38s -> 11587.98s]  your honor that sounds like a mega man that sounds like a map in mega man
[11592.28s -> 11598.38s]  this tool you're able to gain access privileged information that you know
[11598.38s -> 11606.18s]  no of course i don't admit it no i mean i mean maybe once i saw i looked over the shoulder of
[11606.18s -> 11611.58s]  somebody that was doing it no i have no idea what you're talking about because of a use of
[11611.58s -> 11618.41s]  insider information fair competition in the coffee market was destabilized do you understand
[11618.41s -> 11627.99s]  you were responsible for this air competition in the coffee market i was not responsible for
[11627.99s -> 11635.69s]  this what are you talking about you callously reaped tremendous profits from the crash of the
[11635.69s -> 11640.28s]  global gas and electric market a crash that left thousands of people in developing countries that
[11640.28s -> 11647.99s]  produced it unable to care for their families do you deny this i know i didn't do this wait no wait
[11647.99s -> 11657.96s]  i don't want to answer this wrong do you deny this i invoke my right to not respond on the
[11657.96s -> 11662.63s]  advice of counsel that i may incriminate myself but that means that means i did it i deny this
[11662.63s -> 11671.13s]  yes leading the fifth just means yes i did it in a different sentence most significantly the cascade
[11671.13s -> 11674.89s]  of all these actions resulted in nothing less than a civil war within the democratic republic
[11674.89s -> 11682.95s]  of balcador do you realize that you did this for your own personal gain is this the part of the
[11682.95s -> 11690.47s]  movie where i go yes yes it was yeah and i felt like my head starts spinning around i did it
[11690.55s -> 11695.35s]  and i could have gotten away with it too but this little legal council had and i have a
[11695.35s -> 11703.24s]  fucking big black cape on like a big top hat like no i'm gonna deny it you did you really do you
[11703.24s -> 11711.42s]  realize that you did all this for your own personal gain and nothing else no objection your honor none
[11711.42s -> 11715.90s]  of us are here to moralize on the social outcome of a free market these events could have taken
[11715.90s -> 11721.11s]  place regardless of whether or not they invested on behalf of the firm as they did the objection is
[11721.11s -> 11725.83s]  sustained council will limit themselves to matters concerning the specific little realities which
[11725.83s -> 11731.42s]  occurred with pleasure your honor as i mentioned we have overwhelming evidence of insider trading
[11731.42s -> 11736.22s]  through geist net i mentioned the implications only to demonstrate a complete lack of remorse
[11736.22s -> 11741.50s]  on the part of the defendant objection the evidence proves nothing about their state of mind
[11741.50s -> 11746.34s]  his employee was offered the opportunity to cooperate with the government to make amends
[11746.34s -> 11751.24s]  for their crimes and refused this person is a financial professional performing a task on
[11751.24s -> 11755.72s]  behalf of an employer no more responsible or directly connected to the state of the world
[11755.72s -> 11762.04s]  than the rest of us enough i will not have this trial devolve into the kind of circus that led
[11762.04s -> 11767.88s]  up to it again this court will limit itself to the rule of law the impact can be considered if and
[11767.88s -> 11779.43s]  when the client has been found guilty well they won't be the verdict you've been found guilty
[11782.73s -> 11788.01s]  of all charges please know that the jury wait did he just turn and say that to me please know
[11788.01s -> 11794.90s]  that the jury required 15 minutes to reach this verdict however given the scope of restitution
[11794.90s -> 11798.58s]  that could be made this court is determined you will be punished via financial penalty rather
[11798.58s -> 11805.05s]  than incarceration i hereby impose a fine of one million dollars payable immediately
[11806.74s -> 11813.35s]  holy shit that's awesome i have 10 million dollars in the bank your honor i wish to have it noted
[11813.35s -> 11817.75s]  that a penalty of this amount implies the expectation that ferrios will accept liability
[11817.83s -> 11825.34s]  on behalf of the employee and due to substantial liquidity problems at the moment i'm afraid that
[11825.34s -> 11829.02s]  ferrios will not be able to undertake this responsibility the employee will be forced
[11829.02s -> 11838.86s]  to pay the full amount from their personal account is that is that it can i go can i get back to the
[11838.86s -> 11844.20s]  desk your honor according to our evidence the defendant is perfectly capable of making this
[11844.20s -> 11849.08s]  payment from their personal account but your honor think of how little this will leave them
[11849.08s -> 11854.47s]  to begin the long and hard process of rehabilitating their character unfortunately it seems that a
[11854.47s -> 11859.43s]  substantial portion of the funds are overseas held in shell companies are otherwise difficult
[11859.43s -> 11866.47s]  to access fine i will put the matter to the defendant directly are you prepared to cooperate
[11866.47s -> 11876.14s]  with this court to retrieve the payment required i would say no nope i am not i am not prepared
[11877.48s -> 11883.37s]  yes take the take the million the matter is settled then the client will pay the amount
[11883.37s -> 11894.02s]  ordered and be released presently this court is dismissed i'm good i have like 4.8 million dollars
[11894.02s -> 11902.46s]  in my account you're still a millionaire they cracked you good huh you just lost more money
[11902.46s -> 11906.54s]  than most people will ever imagine well you know what they say easy come easy go with everything

[11971.61s -> 11975.99s]  right thing the amount of scrutiny that ferrios is presently under we are unable to render any
[11975.99s -> 11981.03s]  kind of payment which might be misinterpreted as compensating you for paying the fine however
[11981.03s -> 11984.95s]  please know that your loyalty and discretion in this matter has not gone unnoticed or unappreciated
[11986.23s -> 11990.23s]  when time is right you'll be rewarded handsomely for what you've done on a completely unrelated
[11990.23s -> 11994.07s]  unrelated note please send me a list of jurisdictions outside of the free state of
[11994.07s -> 11998.63s]  york dominion where you think you might enjoy permanent residency most of them really aren't

[12004.47s -> 12008.31s]  about it things here will probably be equally bad before too much longer and they've got better
