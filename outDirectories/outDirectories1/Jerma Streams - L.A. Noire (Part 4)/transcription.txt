[1.53s -> 8.22s]  Hey, what's up everybody? What's happening? Welcome to the stream. It's me, Jerma. Nice to see you guys.
[11.62s -> 14.50s]  How was your day today? How were you doing?
[19.03s -> 24.55s]  Today we're gonna be playing the L.A. Noire game that we played last night. We're gonna just keep going.
[28.87s -> 31.05s]  And...
[34.58s -> 38.10s]  Okay, sorry about that for a second there. Just had something in my throat.
[38.82s -> 45.59s]  How is everybody doing today? Are you guys ready to play some games?
[46.47s -> 53.42s]  Okay.
[53.42s -> 54.38s]  Okay.
[54.38s -> 66.38s]  Frame drop. Oh, yeah.
[66.38s -> 74.81s]  That happened to us last time too, though.
[74.81s -> 77.29s]  Sometimes it takes a second for us to get really going.
[77.93s -> 83.91s]  Already dropping frames. Loving the stream, buddy.
[84.79s -> 88.49s]  Come on, man.
[88.49s -> 90.49s]  Come on.
[91.93s -> 94.10s]  I dropped a hundred frames
[94.10s -> 97.43s]  in the first two minutes.
[97.75s -> 99.35s]  It has been like
[99.35s -> 104.23s]  40 hours of streams the last like five days and we've been pretty green.
[104.31s -> 107.27s]  So look, it's gonna it's gonna hiccup every now and again.
[107.83s -> 117.50s]  I mean like, come on, man. My title's got a typo.
[120.47s -> 123.61s]  Uh, oh, yeah, it does.
[124.09s -> 126.09s]  Nice. Hey, good pickup.
[133.26s -> 135.10s]  Well, anyways, hi guys.
[135.10s -> 137.10s]  Uh, we're gonna play L.A. Noire again.
[139.18s -> 141.82s]  Because that's just kind of what I that's what what we're doing.
[142.38s -> 145.50s]  We've got a lot of these games that I started and got halfway through.
[146.38s -> 148.38s]  I'd like to at least attempt to try to finish them.
[153.10s -> 155.50s]  How could I be a substitute teacher if I can't spell unknown?
[155.50s -> 157.50s]  Well, here's the thing. It's called, um,
[158.06s -> 160.06s]  pressing the keys too fast
[160.38s -> 161.42s]  and
[161.42s -> 163.58s]  not pressing down hard enough on the end.
[165.02s -> 169.82s]  Then you graze by it and you keep going. That's where 90% of my problems come from when I'm using the computer.
[170.70s -> 173.58s]  Is just grazing keys and not pressing down hard enough.
[179.35s -> 181.35s]  Making excuses to seem smart.
[181.59s -> 185.10s]  That mean do I need excuses?

[226.20s -> 228.70s]  How does communication work?
[228.70s -> 230.70s]  Communication is film, tv, and radio.

[244.94s -> 247.26s]  that I don't permanently instant ban you.
[247.98s -> 253.69s]  Boomer jokes were never funny. I'm not making them. I'm just responding to them.
[254.25s -> 256.33s]  Should I stop responding to the boomer jokes?
[258.90s -> 264.58s]  Should I do that?
[264.58s -> 266.58s]  Let's get that smooth jasmine, but yes.

[395.05s -> 397.13s]  Before the stream during the stream and after the stream as well
[398.84s -> 404.20s]  And before he streams a blank green background for four hours. Oh, but so much work has gone into this
[404.20s -> 406.20s]  That would be the dumbest thing i've ever done
[406.60s -> 412.04s]  Timber, please turn the game volume down. My wife can't hear it
[413.82s -> 415.82s]  Can the game volume down?

[698.20s -> 700.20s]  What is happening? Nothing
[700.52s -> 706.62s]  What is he talking about? Well, if you were here last night at the very end of the stream
[706.70s -> 708.70s]  We talked about something not bad
[708.94s -> 710.94s]  Does this mark mean anything?
[711.18s -> 719.93s]  Almost gives you an idea of the quality
[719.93s -> 721.19s]  Okay
[721.19s -> 722.58s]  Hello
[722.58s -> 724.58s]  What have you got on the guy who brought these in?
[724.90s -> 728.34s]  It goes by the name of percy b shelley gave an address
[728.98s -> 731.94s]  15 poland street london that's far away
[732.66s -> 735.86s]  Can you give us a description of the man who pawned these rings? Not sure
[736.66s -> 738.66s]  Medium height what if he was like ugly?
[738.90s -> 741.86s]  Really ugly I think ugliest guy i've ever seen
[742.58s -> 746.87s]  He just had one of those forgettable faces. We'll be in touch. Mr. Bremner
[747.51s -> 756.33s]  Okay, I like this desk
[756.73s -> 758.97s]  Then now this is the kind of desk that I wish that that I had
[761.35s -> 763.35s]  On the right you gotta you gotta draw to put your stuff
[763.99s -> 769.83s]  Enough place for three monitors computer can go under here and then a big storage thing. I wish they sold this
[771.82s -> 776.14s]  I'm, not a big fan of the finish. I would I would actually prefer um a walnut finish
[779.54s -> 781.54s]  That desk I have is nice
[781.78s -> 785.05s]  But it's lacking storage
[785.29s -> 787.66s]  You've got to admit this is looking hot
[787.82s -> 789.34s]  And he went to pawn a ring
[789.42s -> 796.07s]  But if you take it along with all of the other indicators real yard hugo moeller was identified by the school's ground keeper
[796.39s -> 801.99s]  He's our guy witnesses have fingered the wrong guy before he ran for god's sake. What's my game of the year so far?
[801.99s -> 805.27s]  He always maintained he was uh red dead redemption 2 made it unfair
[806.55s -> 808.07s]  We have a problem
[808.07s -> 813.27s]  We could have the local so i'm not gonna you know i'm not gonna include red dead redemption 2 in my list
[813.91s -> 815.91s]  purpose of games of the year
[816.23s -> 818.23s]  Because that's just cheating it's not fair
[820.15s -> 824.63s]  That's like an s tier it's that that always is number one and then we have to find out like what the other ones
[824.63s -> 830.81s]  Underneath it are all your letters are genuine and the man who may have also killed dear drew moeller
[831.69s -> 834.09s]  And how do we prove that like if you do a top five?
[834.73s -> 839.13s]  In like the golden locked slot up above the top five is red dead redemption 2
[843.74s -> 846.17s]  So
[850.81s -> 858.36s]  Red redemption 2 is zero
[860.60s -> 862.52s]  What have you played it?
[862.52s -> 867.02s]  It's very fun
[867.02s -> 869.02s]  I still have to play god of war. That's
[869.58s -> 871.74s]  People are talking about how great that was
[873.54s -> 876.02s]  Spider-man was really good house flipper
[878.23s -> 883.27s]  And I try really do mean that completely not joking like i'm not kidding when I say that
[886.30s -> 890.54s]  Yeah, those of you that think that's a joke. I mean it sounds like a joke, but it's not
[897.24s -> 899.24s]  Zero is below one
[899.48s -> 901.98s]  Well, yeah zero, yeah
[901.98s -> 903.98s]  One zero would not be above one
[906.17s -> 910.25s]  A way out a way out was a really interesting game that had a really interesting cool finish
[910.65s -> 912.97s]  But the whole game of a way out was a little
[914.17s -> 918.89s]  It was a little I don't know the climax of a way out was amazing
[920.14s -> 921.42s]  I don't know
[921.42s -> 936.47s]  What else came out this year?
[936.47s -> 939.99s]  This is so much further away than the objective, but by the way, this is like this
[940.07s -> 942.07s]  I don't even want to do this anymore. It's too far away
[942.79s -> 951.29s]  What was better detroit become human or a way out?
[954.28s -> 960.47s]  uh
[960.47s -> 967.64s]  uh, I don't know
[970.73s -> 972.73s]  I mean probably a way out because
[973.21s -> 974.81s]  a way out was
[974.81s -> 976.65s]  Something very different
[976.65s -> 978.98s]  It gets an extra notch
[978.98s -> 980.18s]  on the belt
[980.18s -> 982.10s]  for being
[982.10s -> 993.53s]  All different if detroit become human got rid of the other two storylines and it was just
[994.92s -> 999.16s]  Connor and hank go on admissions together and it's like a buddy cop game
[999.96s -> 1001.72s]  I would probably think it was
[1001.80s -> 1003.80s]  Way better than it was
[1013.29s -> 1019.10s]  Don't shoot him. Oh, wow. He shot him. Why did he start running this way?
[1021.62s -> 1023.22s]  What
[1023.22s -> 1027.42s]  This isn't like a football game, man. You don't have to like
[1028.22s -> 1031.03s]  Oh boy. Sorry
[1032.38s -> 1035.10s]  All right. Don't kill this guy. I need to apprehend him
[1039.38s -> 1042.58s]  Killing this guy is not I I need to apprehend the suspect
[1043.46s -> 1045.46s]  No more code fours
[1045.54s -> 1054.47s]  I almost shot that guy right there because he had the same clothes on
[1055.43s -> 1060.98s]  Why is this guy so much faster?
[1060.98s -> 1062.98s]  Okay, here we go
[1063.30s -> 1070.41s]  Wait, he's not getting in a car. He's in he's he's in the car. Which car is he in?
[1080.82s -> 1082.82s]  It's a stitch up with her lovely tune
[1083.22s -> 1102.86s]  I thought he was trying okay
[1102.86s -> 1104.54s]  I thought if he followed him for long enough
[1104.54s -> 1107.74s]  He was gonna got in the car and was gonna leave and then I saw the gunshots and I
[1108.14s -> 1111.50s]  Didn't know which car he was behind and then it was too late by the time he got behind the car
[1112.60s -> 1114.92s]  Like you the death sentence was already there. So
[1125.96s -> 1129.56s]  He was there for a solid fight. I doesn't I I i'm sorry
[1130.28s -> 1135.80s]  But he got behind the car and I was already backing up and I didn't feel like getting out to like pursue him in
[1135.80s -> 1140.36s]  Or he probably would have shot me and then I would have seen the lul in the chat a hundred times
[1141.56s -> 1146.44s]  You know, I would have got out like how do I arrest him? What's the arrest button? What's the arrest button?
[1147.24s -> 1152.76s]  And then he was chopping the head and it would have been like lul like failed fish like idiot guys stump stupid idiot
[1153.06s -> 1155.40s]  126 iq I would have seen I've looked over and would have saw it
[1156.04s -> 1159.56s]  So I took it into my own hands and he got in the way. So it's just I'll finish
[1174.17s -> 1176.57s]  He still saw lul a hundred times
[1177.45s -> 1183.53s]  But that was not like and that was not me intentionally trying to receive lul because there's plenty of moments where like you can tell
[1184.33s -> 1187.61s]  I'm intentionally trying to get some lul's out of the out of you guys
[1188.17s -> 1196.12s]  I would say it's like I'd say it's like like 30 percent is intentional lul moments and the other 70 percent
[1196.60s -> 1198.60s]  Is unintentional lul moments
[1201.50s -> 1202.94s]  And that was one of those
[1202.94s -> 1220.71s]  God damn it. We survived this
[1220.79s -> 1226.47s]  It's going to be another thing to just to briefly bring up it and me saying lul and you guys, you know kind of
[1226.87s -> 1227.81s]  be
[1227.81s -> 1229.43s]  Inceptioning that into your head
[1229.43s -> 1233.51s]  As I got back with the analytics and the data behind it and I send certain companies that contact me
[1233.51s -> 1238.47s]  Well, how how how funny is your stream? Well, you know, if you take a look at the amount of lul's that happened last night
[1239.03s -> 1242.87s]  Uh a lot here forty two forty three hundred lul's
[1243.67s -> 1247.67s]  Uh, I can i'm here for you company b company a

[1996.63s -> 2003.11s]  That's all he did trauma to the temple nose and eye regions ligature marks point to the probable cause of death being strangulation
[2003.11s -> 2009.35s]  He didn't have any other lines any idea of the time of death from her temperature after midnight would be my guess
[2012.66s -> 2015.37s]  Okay midnight

[3234.06s -> 3238.94s]  For five seconds and drinks. They've had any money. That'd be a really weird reason to hate somebody
[3239.26s -> 3241.26s]  Did you ever tell you where she was staying?
[3241.42s -> 3245.50s]  I don't think she was living rough. She had that kind of schtunk about yeah

[3276.73s -> 3278.73s]  How well did you know her?
[3278.81s -> 3283.05s]  I can't say that I knew her it was more like I was aware of her
[3287.32s -> 3290.84s]  What was your last contact with event? Did you see eveline last night? No
[3291.24s -> 3294.20s]  I was at home. That's bullshit writing
[3295.08s -> 3308.60s]  Maybe not. I mean you're moving around a lot though, but he's not darting his eyes around
[3309.56s -> 3319.85s]  Do you want to get dragged into this McCaffrey? Do you want us to get interested in you?
[3320.65s -> 3323.53s]  She hung out with this powder puff james tiernan
[3324.25s -> 3330.97s]  They haunted the public library together. Oh, well, do you know james tiernan? I know he works some kind of plebeian job

[3418.69s -> 3420.61s]  He's doing a lot of blinking
[3420.61s -> 3429.94s]  You want to save me some time or do you want me to look up your file industrial disputes?
[3430.66s -> 3432.58s]  strikes
[3432.58s -> 3434.58s]  worker's rights
[3434.74s -> 3437.49s]  That kind of a regular fifth column
[3438.37s -> 3440.37s]  Nice to meet you comrade
[3440.37s -> 3444.15s]  So I was gonna do a thing and now thank you for the information to do it mccaffrey
[3445.92s -> 3447.92s]  Where I was going to do?
[3448.16s -> 3450.00s]  a um
[3450.00s -> 3452.56s]  I wonder if there's an extension I could use to do it to kind of be fun
[3452.96s -> 3457.04s]  But this would just the reason why I can't is because this would just be the lie detector stream again
[3457.04s -> 3459.04s]  But a different version of it
[3459.20s -> 3464.72s]  Or I would just put the prompts on the screen and just sit in the right position and have you guys interview me?
[3465.76s -> 3467.76s]  But we already like we already did that
[3472.20s -> 3489.88s]  Um, let's go. Let's go to the bar. Wait, we already went to the bar. There's something else here
[3496.72s -> 3500.72s]  Yeah, did the same camera angle and sound effects but that would take some time to put together but be fun
[3501.68s -> 3504.84s]  Did I miss something here?
[3504.84s -> 3508.04s]  You're free to speak to the regulars just don't shake them too hard
[3511.04s -> 3515.84s]  Go to a casino for a stream and like I I you're not allowed to film in a casino
[3518.32s -> 3521.20s]  You'll get a a hand swat down on your hand
[3522.00s -> 3537.08s]  I like an idea though. Why don't I just like run my own casino from my house?
[3537.72s -> 3540.10s]  you know what I mean
[3540.10s -> 3543.70s]  I could like instead of I could try to make some extra money on the side by
[3544.42s -> 3548.02s]  Inviting people over to play like blackjack in my this is a will ferrell movie. Never mind
[3548.90s -> 3561.80s]  I don't think I can do anything else here
[3564.68s -> 3568.20s]  I mean, there's this person here. But again, I think I can talk to thank you a friend of
[3568.76s -> 3573.08s]  Summers didn't ask it very cute. You know, who's asking? I know my rights
[3573.64s -> 3575.64s]  You don't have any answer the question
[3576.84s -> 3580.92s]  Evelyn mooch is for drinks. I don't have any time for that. Was that so hard?
[3581.56s -> 3583.56s]  Keep writing me copper
[3585.30s -> 3588.39s]  Um
[3588.39s -> 3598.66s]  Okay
[3598.66s -> 3599.86s]  Okay
[3599.86s -> 3601.22s]  What's next?
[3601.22s -> 3605.38s]  Uh the liquor store. I don't know what i'm missing here, but I don't know what it is. So we're just gonna go
[3606.66s -> 3609.97s]  You hate the new wendy's ad. What is the wendy? What is it?
[3611.59s -> 3613.51s]  What did you make him a cafri? Let me guess
[3614.55s -> 3620.47s]  He'll come a day two close friends sitting at inside eating in the restaurant, but he's out of us here
[3620.71s -> 3624.07s]  Which by the way that very never very rarely does that happen?
[3624.55s -> 3630.47s]  I don't know what it is with fast food companies where they depict like whole people going in whole families and friends like having
[3631.11s -> 3634.95s]  Like getting together and sitting around like a big table and eating donald's
[3636.07s -> 3639.20s]  That no one does that
[3639.28s -> 3641.28s]  That's first that's the first mistake
[3644.39s -> 3646.26s]  whole people
[3646.26s -> 3649.54s]  And then their second mistake is people being excited about peeling off
[3650.02s -> 3653.14s]  Stickers that give you like 20 cents off of a large soda
[3653.94s -> 3658.34s]  Like oh man, yeah, bro. I won and they hold it up and it's like oh me too. I want a nugget
[3658.90s -> 3661.06s]  Nobody you ripped it off and you're like, oh, I don't fucking care
[3661.06s -> 3663.38s]  You never use it because you throw it in the trash. You never bring it back
[3664.34s -> 3672.23s]  What can I do for you? LAPD Phelps and Galloway. We're making inquiries into the murder of Evelyn summers
[3673.19s -> 3674.47s]  Evelyn
[3674.47s -> 3682.36s]  She's dead. You knew Evelyn summers, mr. Robbins. Yes. I knew Evelyn. I was a good friend of her ex-husband
[3683.00s -> 3687.00s]  She kept some of her stuff here. Yeah boardwalk and park place collect them both and you get a jet
[3687.56s -> 3689.56s]  Come this way you get a million dollars
[3689.88s -> 3691.96s]  They don't even print those, you know
[3691.96s -> 3694.90s]  They don't even print
[3694.90s -> 3698.26s]  Boardwalk they print park place and park place is so common
[3699.57s -> 3702.93s]  Everybody gets park place and then they go. Oh shit, dude. I just need boardwalk and i'm dead
[3702.93s -> 3704.93s]  They don't even print boardwalk. It's not even printed
[3712.87s -> 3717.67s]  The ceo of mcdonald's like he's gets on a plane to some random town in iowa
[3718.23s -> 3723.67s]  And he like slips boardwalk on one of the slips one of the drinks down and into fucking some random place
[3724.31s -> 3726.47s]  And the next person in line gets it is one printed
[3742.23s -> 3754.13s]  He did something other than drinking her spare time. Oh, she was bowler
[3755.01s -> 3764.21s]  The ceo slipped the ceo. She's like goes into a random store with quite some time. It's in a case
[3765.33s -> 3768.37s]  That large mcdonald's fucking soda
[3768.85s -> 3773.89s]  With the boardwalk on it is in a locked gold case that only the ceo is allowed to touch
[3774.85s -> 3775.73s]  and he
[3775.73s -> 3779.81s]  In his weird fucking creepy tower throws a dart at the board in the united states
[3780.13s -> 3784.37s]  And picks the one place that he's going to go sneak and put like a fake mustache on and drop off the golden case
[3785.01s -> 3797.03s]  One summer is what exactly did evelyn work in the pictures?
[3798.21s -> 3802.76s]  1938 worked in legal copyrights for music. Okay
[3807.72s -> 3809.72s]  You've said too much already
[3809.80s -> 3812.74s]  Is the volume below them i'll turn it up for you
[3816.23s -> 3817.11s]  picture
[3817.11s -> 3830.66s]  Okay, is that it?
[3831.22s -> 3844.28s]  Evelyn was reading aristotle
[3844.90s -> 3846.90s]  Aristotle metaphysics
[3847.64s -> 3849.64s]  The stupid thing about her was
[3850.04s -> 3855.72s]  What else is in here and she was borrowing books from grovener mcaffrey
[3857.33s -> 3860.12s]  Can I read?
[3860.12s -> 3862.07s]  um
[3862.07s -> 3864.55s]  Yes, yes, I know how to read. Thank you
[3865.78s -> 3867.78s]  She wasn't always such a loner
[3867.86s -> 3871.22s]  Okay
[3871.22s -> 3877.72s]  Ronald mcdonald hates you because he said all those mean things about mcdonald's
[3878.36s -> 3880.36s]  I didn't say anything mean about mcdonald's
[3881.56s -> 3885.20s]  What did I say bad about mcdonald's? I was just speaking
[3886.16s -> 3888.16s]  candidly in my opinion of
[3888.24s -> 3890.24s]  The contest of the monopoly contest
[3891.12s -> 3893.12s]  I didn't say it was bad
[3893.36s -> 3899.86s]  I I eat mcdonald's mcdonald's is fine. It tastes good big mac number one
[3902.45s -> 3904.37s]  I mean, you really can't beat a number one. I don't think
[3912.34s -> 3914.58s]  Big macs are awful cut nothing, but
[3916.37s -> 3918.50s]  I don't think so
[3918.50s -> 3922.90s]  Number two the two single cheeseburgers. I mean, it's hard to argue
[3923.46s -> 3927.88s]  It's hard to argue with facts. Okay, the number one from mcdonald's
[3928.66s -> 3931.62s]  Is probably the best fast food item
[3933.35s -> 3939.99s]  Besides that you're talking about the wendy's crispy chicken sandwich or scares away customers the wendy's crispy chicken sandwich
[3940.47s -> 3942.47s]  Or the burger king long chicken sandwich
[3944.77s -> 3947.01s]  I mean those are that I think those are tied for first place
[3948.87s -> 3950.87s]  Gentlemen, I have a store to run
[3951.32s -> 3953.86s]  What are we doing?
[3953.86s -> 3959.86s]  We're trying to account for everyone's movements. I think it's big burger king sucks. Okay morning burger king doesn't do anything good anymore
[3959.94s -> 3961.94s]  Let's pick up some of our things
[3961.94s -> 3965.78s]  Yeah, here's a burger king just goes. Hey, wait, our food sucks really bad
[3966.10s -> 3970.82s]  So let's just like dump a bunch of sauce and bacon on every sandwich and that's how that's how they get customers and it
[3970.82s -> 3972.34s]  tastes good
[3972.34s -> 3983.67s]  I'm surprised burger king's still in business
[3984.63s -> 3990.63s]  I look I don't hate burger king. I think it tastes fine. I mean I I ate burger king like two weeks ago and I was like
[3990.63s -> 3992.32s]  Oh, this is good
[3992.32s -> 3995.04s]  but I mean
[3995.04s -> 3997.92s]  You can't and the taco bell is in this here, too
[3998.72s -> 4001.20s]  The cheesy godita crunch beats the big mac
[4002.34s -> 4007.06s]  In a one-to-one fight, right? But if the big mac has the number two in the corner as a tag team
[4007.62s -> 4010.90s]  Nothing else on the whole taco bell menu is worth eating. You know what i'm saying?
[4011.38s -> 4017.86s]  So one-on-one fight go to keep cheesy godita crunch will win every time having cops in the store scares away customers
[4018.42s -> 4022.16s]  What about kfc?
[4022.16s -> 4027.12s]  stuff like that you you check filet you but no no guys guys guys
[4028.72s -> 4032.56s]  Like you can't bring in like the higher tiered fast food places
[4033.20s -> 4035.20s]  They're in different with different weight classes
[4036.10s -> 4039.94s]  Like the the featherweight doesn't fight the heavyweight. You know i'm saying they're in different weight classes
[4040.50s -> 4046.34s]  No, kfc is not a higher tier. Check filet is a higher tier
[4047.06s -> 4058.79s]  Arby's is a higher tier. I'm not putting kfc in high tier. I'm putting kfc in the in the other in the gentleman
[4058.79s -> 4063.67s]  I have a store to run. Arby's is garbage, but it's like it's it's but they have fresh turkey
[4063.75s -> 4070.92s]  Okay, there's fresh turkey at Arby's. They don't have that at McDonald's. What was the question? I don't even remember
[4071.00s -> 4072.52s]  I don't know what he even said
[4072.52s -> 4077.38s]  Can I can I review the information?
[4080.87s -> 4084.66s]  F tier kfc is good. You're all idiots
[4084.66s -> 4088.06s]  Idiots
[4088.94s -> 4090.94s]  You're all idiots
[4093.64s -> 4098.20s]  No, i'm not saying that i'm saying what somebody said
[4103.06s -> 4105.62s]  No, I was quoting what somebody else said
[4107.86s -> 4109.86s]  the gentleman i've
[4109.94s -> 4114.58s]  Okay, i'm just gonna pick one. I don't know what he did, but he looks like he's telling the truth
[4115.30s -> 4122.42s]  Any idea where the money came from? She didn't mention it, but she did say the booze was a present for a boy
[4124.15s -> 4126.95s]  She said they have been fighting and she had to make it up to her
[4130.38s -> 4134.23s]  Okay
[4134.23s -> 4137.75s]  I don't I don't i kfc is good. What's wrong? Are you in devil close? Mr. Robin?
[4138.55s -> 4143.03s]  How many people will be sad? It's not it's not at the same quality and tier of like
[4143.99s -> 4145.43s]  uh
[4145.43s -> 4148.63s]  What what give me give me some higher tiered like fast food places
[4149.27s -> 4151.27s]  You've got um
[4151.94s -> 4153.94s]  You've got arby's
[4155.80s -> 4161.00s]  I'm not even paying attention anymore. Fuck. Why does this have to happen? I'm gonna lose this case
[4165.21s -> 4169.88s]  Fresh turkey
[4170.12s -> 4174.12s]  I've only had arby's one time. I've I have no opinion on arby's
[4174.68s -> 4181.34s]  What did he say?
[4181.34s -> 4188.86s]  I've got the impression that evelyn had been sleeping rough of late. This is why people hate you
[4190.62s -> 4194.14s]  Why am I shilling it i'm just i'm not trying to get her back on the straight and narrow
[4194.22s -> 4198.70s]  I aren't look i already told you the number one and the number two from mcdonald's to be honest
[4198.78s -> 4203.10s]  You have to have a good reason to want to get very difficult to beat on the run
[4204.04s -> 4206.04s]  Unless you're a cheese it go do the crunch
[4209.13s -> 4216.09s]  I got them both right. Do you know a friend of evelyn's by the name of mcaffrey?
[4216.73s -> 4221.91s]  Not personally
[4221.91s -> 4223.91s]  This guy just telling the truth, isn't it?
[4227.35s -> 4230.22s]  No, he's not
[4230.22s -> 4233.82s]  We're struggling for leads robbins. Did she know mcaffrey?
[4234.54s -> 4236.14s]  She idolized him
[4236.14s -> 4240.01s]  And what I gather the feeling was far from mutual
[4240.81s -> 4244.87s]  He seems to have missed eating dog food tier fast food on stream
[4247.27s -> 4249.83s]  You could see how it's all bad. It's like evelyn
[4251.27s -> 4254.23s]  None of it's like any good mr. Robbins. No problem
[4255.59s -> 4260.63s]  I got them all correct. Hey, i'd like to make arrangements for the funeral
[4260.95s -> 4263.45s]  You think I could get in touch with evelyn's mother?
[4263.85s -> 4266.97s]  Put in a call to the watch commander. What's my favorite brand of chicken nugget?
[4267.21s -> 4269.53s]  He'll be trying to reach the next of kin. Well, thanks
[4270.17s -> 4277.90s]  I bred my own chicken nuggets and I make them from scratch. Evelyn never hurt anybody not wendy's of the bed wendy's
[4291.66s -> 4293.66s]  So we need to go
[4293.82s -> 4309.93s]  But I don't have chick-fil-a
[4309.93s -> 4313.29s]  At least I don't know if there's any around in las vegas, but in
[4314.31s -> 4320.43s]  Massachusetts, I don't think I think there was one chick-fil-a in the entire state of massachusetts. Let's not keep the man away. It wasn't available
[4324.95s -> 4328.22s]  Go to the bowling alley
[4328.22s -> 4329.82s]  We just like learned that

[4355.75s -> 4356.71s]  so I
[4356.71s -> 4359.26s]  I can't tell you
[4359.26s -> 4360.62s]  I mean i
[4360.62s -> 4364.22s]  Gordon ramsay steak was probably the best piece of meat i've ever eaten
[4365.37s -> 4374.07s]  So I mean is that?
[4376.47s -> 4379.99s]  It was it just was I I can't just be like, well, you know
[4380.87s -> 4384.71s]  It was the best piece of uh, like red meat I probably ever had
[4386.47s -> 4397.19s]  Hello rusty two on your usual lane. I'm detective felts homicide. You must be new

[4515.90s -> 4516.86s]  Wow
[4516.86s -> 4522.94s]  These are flashy cars to be parked outside of bowling alley the lanes attract a fast-living individual with money to burn
[4523.66s -> 4526.30s]  Or a middle-aged individual with the need to feel dark

[4551.02s -> 4556.22s]  Another runner at least we've got a suspect. Why do they always run?
[4556.46s -> 4560.94s]  I'm sure we've got the wrong person in more than one of these homicides, but they always seem to land
[4564.70s -> 4567.90s]  That's not him spinning out that's him just dropping through the park, okay
[4568.94s -> 4573.22s]  If this isn't the killer we can at least get him for reckless endangerment
[4573.38s -> 4577.30s]  That's unless he runs into a wall and it saves us all the trouble this car is going to explode
[4579.38s -> 4586.54s]  Tunnels god damn it. He'll kill himself. All right knocking into the train

[4633.45s -> 4636.09s]  So what does that mean? So that's uh, that's the suspect

[4780.97s -> 4783.69s]  As far as we can be sure it said cunt bd

[5184.30s -> 5189.58s]  I will say that the criminals have been very very bad at not leaving the bloody clothes
[5190.06s -> 5193.18s]  And murder weapon on the ground in their apartment
[5195.77s -> 5197.93s]  He said at least put it in the closet
[5198.89s -> 5204.10s]  And we have a book. I see carothers argues way out of this one
[5206.15s -> 5208.15s]  specifically the tire irons
[5208.89s -> 5210.25s]  Who are you guys?
[5210.25s -> 5215.45s]  What are you doing in here from the la pd, ma'am? Do you know where we might find mcaffery? I'm his neighbor
[5216.41s -> 5221.53s]  Is he in trouble? Look lady we need to find him and in a hurry. Are you gonna give me trouble?
[5221.61s -> 5223.61s]  He has a pigeon coop up on the roof
[5224.01s -> 5230.60s]  He spends his mornings up there when he's been drinking how do we get up there he drinks with pigeons down the hall and up the stairs
[5232.12s -> 5237.96s]  That's kind of drunken in command of a carrier. It's kind of badass actually like surely we can get drunk with pigeons
[5238.52s -> 5243.72s]  A citation at least change the outfit again. Why i'm going to be officer felps
[5244.76s -> 5250.58s]  So we're gonna go up on we're gonna go up on the roof
[5255.14s -> 5263.53s]  That way stupid
[5263.61s -> 5268.97s]  Rooms 9 and 10 room 11. No, that's not it. We gotta go up. We are at the top
[5272.55s -> 5274.55s]  But what out the window?
[5276.41s -> 5278.71s]  No, there's roof access
[5291.14s -> 5295.70s]  Running on a hangover mcaffery sit down and we'll talk. Did he think that was gonna work?
[5298.12s -> 5303.86s]  I'm gonna throw a bird at you. Nice try don't get down
[5305.61s -> 5308.58s]  Go back up
[5308.58s -> 5310.84s]  All right. Come here grover
[5310.84s -> 5313.24s]  Grover mcaffery you are under arrest
[5320.10s -> 5322.73s]  He just got stuck there
[5322.73s -> 5325.37s]  You a runner mcaffery stay and fight the good fight
[5326.09s -> 5334.78s]  tackle
[5334.78s -> 5336.26s]  tackle
[5336.26s -> 5337.93s]  tackle them
[5337.93s -> 5342.10s]  Not yet
[5342.10s -> 5344.10s]  Give it up la pd
[5344.34s -> 5347.75s]  I mean, I think he knows where you're from at this point felps
[5349.54s -> 5353.54s]  You're wearing a police outfit. You've said it three times. Here comes the tackle
[5354.66s -> 5356.02s]  tackle
[5356.02s -> 5358.97s]  tackle
[5358.97s -> 5360.54s]  tackle
[5360.54s -> 5367.67s]  Tackle him. There it is
[5367.67s -> 5369.67s]  Can't we talk about this?
[5369.67s -> 5371.67s]  What the fuck?
[5371.91s -> 5396.74s]  What can't we talk about?
[5405.38s -> 5406.98s]  Little thing was
[5406.98s -> 5408.90s]  Uh kind of messed up
[5408.90s -> 5417.24s]  We need to get downtown and wrap this thing up. It's got to be the captain unless
[5417.80s -> 5423.08s]  Terran and set him up. We talk about don't think that asshole jamison could have done it. Do you?
[5423.72s -> 5430.02s]  And whoever did it brain just shut up his brain queued up that line
[5430.98s -> 5435.86s]  And it was already into his mouth through his vocal cords by the time he was knocked out his name was never on it
[5436.50s -> 5442.90s]  If you think the list is exhaustive rusty, who am I to argue listen? Let's just work the case at hand. Shall we?
[5443.62s -> 5449.18s]  Then we can sit down for all the puzzle pieces to get right on this side
[5450.06s -> 5451.90s]  I ain't scared
[5451.90s -> 5458.47s]  Still gonna do it. I'm not scared
[5459.35s -> 5463.06s]  I'm not even gonna get off this either
[5472.25s -> 5474.25s]  Well, I passed it
[5474.57s -> 5478.98s]  Give me a break
[5478.98s -> 5484.15s]  It's too focused on driving on the tracks
[5484.79s -> 5491.99s]  I was hoping I was hoping it was going down going to the cut scene
[5492.95s -> 5500.55s]  But it didn't excuse excuses excuses excuse
[5501.11s -> 5511.66s]  All right, we got a lineup. We have a couple of suspect stick with one of these suspects
[5512.46s -> 5514.46s]  It's either mcaffrey or tiernan, sir
[5514.78s -> 5516.78s]  I think jamison is an aberration
[5517.82s -> 5519.02s]  All right
[5519.02s -> 5524.62s]  I'll deal with that degraded lunatic myself. He's got some fearful retribution coming turn in as a one
[5524.78s -> 5530.09s]  Caffrey isn't two. I want the confession from one of them. All right, let's go
[5531.61s -> 5536.92s]  Where we go who we go first
[5536.92s -> 5539.48s]  Whatever one of these are strips off me at the grand jury two
[5541.05s -> 5543.21s]  Who's in in a room? You've been you're in room two
[5544.17s -> 5547.93s]  It's you ready to caffrey questions. You think I have all the answers
[5548.73s -> 5551.21s]  People who run from the police usually have something to hide
[5552.01s -> 5554.89s]  Touche detective
[5554.89s -> 5556.89s]  Let's see where this takes us
[5560.55s -> 5563.59s]  Relate to chip with the victim, but wait a minute
[5564.60s -> 5568.76s]  I need to see some things here because we have pawned rings rings pawned by suspect
[5569.32s -> 5571.72s]  Percy be shelly dark hair medium height and build
[5573.94s -> 5578.50s]  Show vagrant lifestyle missing ring good and from marks on victim's skin. The ring was gone
[5580.18s -> 5582.18s]  digest after midnight
[5583.16s -> 5585.22s]  handbag
[5585.22s -> 5588.10s]  movie lot employee id found among victims personal effects
[5591.10s -> 5595.50s]  This lipstick in possession of john ferdinand jameson
[5596.22s -> 5604.10s]  Torn letter addressed to evelyn pieces found in possession of victim and mcaffrey parking tickets to hand out. This is the one
[5604.82s -> 5606.82s]  Okay, so this ties them together
[5609.64s -> 5614.36s]  Inscribed this is the mcaffrey found amongst her personal things. This is his book
[5614.92s -> 5619.32s]  So, I don't know what she is. She'd never let me borrow a library book. Oh, yeah, I got it right here
[5620.28s -> 5625.45s]  With victim bought whiskey for a boy after an argument
[5626.74s -> 5630.20s]  And then there's a tie iron. Okay
[5630.28s -> 5636.20s]  What is your relationship with you told us you barely knew evelyn summers. She hung around sometimes
[5637.66s -> 5639.83s]  I had very little to do it
[5640.15s -> 5641.43s]  Well, that's not true
[5641.43s -> 5642.84s]  uh
[5642.84s -> 5645.62s]  Now the question is
[5645.62s -> 5647.62s]  Is it like the book?
[5647.94s -> 5649.94s]  You do you have you lent her a book?
[5651.67s -> 5654.95s]  Like that's very clearly like your signature and you lent it to her
[5655.59s -> 5657.27s]  Or this letter
[5657.27s -> 5666.47s]  You'll have to do better than that grovener. We know about you and evelyn. Evelyn was a lush and a boring one at that
[5667.51s -> 5670.39s]  You can't link her to me
[5670.63s -> 5673.86s]  All right. Well
[5673.86s -> 5678.50s]  Which one is more damning though? I mean this this did he write this who wrote this?
[5682.66s -> 5684.66s]  I mean the book is
[5684.74s -> 5686.34s]  It's clearly
[5686.34s -> 5690.94s]  It just has his signature in it
[5690.94s -> 5695.34s]  But yeah, I mean that's we know that you thought enough of her to loan out your copy of the metaphysics
[5695.58s -> 5697.26s]  I what?
[5697.26s -> 5701.02s]  I did no such thing that bitch stole that book from my apartment
[5701.50s -> 5705.26s]  The impudent fucking moron and that made you angry angry
[5705.82s -> 5710.78s]  I was livid looking up at me with that stupid face of hers begging me to forgive her
[5716.36s -> 5718.36s]  Very good
[5718.44s -> 5722.20s]  That's one to you detective. This guy's fucking crazy
[5723.96s -> 5725.16s]  Ah
[5725.16s -> 5727.16s]  We're not like a what?
[5727.24s -> 5729.24s]  Okay alibi
[5729.32s -> 5732.20s]  What's your alibi? Evelyn died sometime around midnight
[5732.92s -> 5734.92s]  Remind me. Where were you?
[5735.16s -> 5737.16s]  I was at home
[5737.32s -> 5738.73s]  writing
[5738.73s -> 5740.73s]  I'm working on a manuscript
[5744.78s -> 5749.88s]  Uh, where are you now? You're going to need to do better if you don't want to swing for this
[5751.16s -> 5755.72s]  I was having a political meeting in my apartment cheese and crackers for the fifth column
[5756.20s -> 5762.20s]  Some of these people will corroborate your story. I won't give up names of party members good
[5763.16s -> 5765.45s]  Your funeral
[5765.45s -> 5767.77s]  It's either going to be you or tier net opener
[5768.98s -> 5771.29s]  Make it stick detective
[5771.29s -> 5773.29s]  The party has good lawyers
[5774.81s -> 5776.81s]  No, you've got me you got me there touche
[5778.55s -> 5780.55s]  Well, let's go talk to the other guy
[5787.78s -> 5789.78s]  All right. We need interview room one
[5790.42s -> 5792.98s]  Which is it this way?
[5795.29s -> 5797.53s]  No guns. Wait, is this an interview room?
[5798.97s -> 5804.79s]  No, this is the holding cell
[5804.79s -> 5806.79s]  Here's interview room one
[5809.02s -> 5811.02s]  Why did you run tiernan?
[5811.18s -> 5816.06s]  I was the last one to see ephelin that night. I knew you would think it was me. Oh bloody
[5817.90s -> 5819.90s]  All right. This is the bowling alley guy
[5821.43s -> 5823.83s]  So hold on relationship with the bowling alley guy
[5826.44s -> 5827.48s]  handbag
[5827.48s -> 5829.43s]  movie lot
[5829.43s -> 5831.27s]  uh
[5831.27s -> 5834.76s]  Liquor purchase so liquor purchase
[5835.40s -> 5839.48s]  Store owner robbins testifies victim bought whiskey for a boy after an argument, right?
[5840.62s -> 5843.34s]  So he's gonna he this is this is the boy, right?
[5843.74s -> 5846.14s]  Can you describe your relationship with eveline?
[5847.11s -> 5858.15s]  I barely knew everyone
[5858.15s -> 5861.83s]  Sounds like half an answer to me tiernan. Were you sleeping with her?
[5862.71s -> 5871.67s]  That's none of your business
[5871.81s -> 5874.63s]  Aristotle's metaphysics the book that belonged to mcaffrey
[5875.27s -> 5880.63s]  Mccaffrey saw her looking at her once and laughed in her face. What's in his front pocket? You're saying eveline stole it
[5881.83s -> 5889.03s]  She wanted something of his truth
[5889.99s -> 5891.99s]  I mean that's he's staring
[5893.00s -> 5895.21s]  Directly
[5895.21s -> 5898.81s]  That's truth
[5898.81s -> 5901.29s]  Look at his eyes. He is locked in
[5902.01s -> 5906.30s]  You don't like mcaffrey. Do you tiernan?
[5907.96s -> 5911.16s]  He's full of the common manner team, but he props up a bar like the rest of us
[5912.74s -> 5914.74s]  Evelyn thought he was going to be a great novelist
[5916.76s -> 5918.76s]  He had nothing but victory offer
[5919.91s -> 5922.63s]  Holy shit, that's wrong. He okay. So this guy
[5923.93s -> 5928.73s]  He wasn't darting. Okay alibi for you and Evelyn were drinking together last night
[5929.21s -> 5933.21s]  And she had no other place to stay. I don't know what happened last night
[5934.01s -> 5937.13s]  I don't remember. We got him here because this is the little bit. Yeah, you're
[5939.37s -> 5945.37s]  Yeah, i'm, sorry, dude. You're lying tiernan. She bought you booze and you know it you fought and i'm not lying
[5945.45s -> 5947.45s]  She got up and left. That was it
[5951.03s -> 5952.30s]  well
[5952.30s -> 5954.30s]  Sorry, but facts
[5954.38s -> 5955.90s]  Stayed other ones
[5955.90s -> 5961.58s]  She left but she came back. She bought you a quart of whiskey to make it up to you. She told the liquor store owner
[5962.38s -> 5964.38s]  You're in deep trouble, buddy
[5964.38s -> 5967.26s]  She said she loved me
[5967.26s -> 5969.26s]  She wanted to care for me. Oh
[5970.09s -> 5972.57s]  Confession never stopped talking about mcaffrey confession
[5973.53s -> 5979.69s]  Mccaffrey was a writer and mcaffrey was a hero mcaffrey cared for the little guy. Did you kill her tiernan confession?
[5980.25s -> 5982.25s]  I might as well have confession
[5982.81s -> 5987.45s]  Kicked her out. I kicked her. She had nowhere to go in her mouth. What? Okay. Well
[5987.53s -> 5991.72s]  Well
[5991.72s -> 5994.12s]  Do you own a car tiernan? No, I don't
[5996.79s -> 5998.79s]  Have access to a lug wrench
[5998.79s -> 6001.83s]  No, we use a lot of them to clear jams in the pin setting machines
[6004.97s -> 6007.53s]  No, this is okay. He's lying. But hold on. Wait, wait, wait
[6016.52s -> 6018.84s]  That's not that good deck. I don't think I can connect it
[6022.70s -> 6025.26s]  Coroner's report says that evelyn was killed with a wrench
[6025.98s -> 6030.14s]  I think you did it and then planted the evidence at mcaffrey's apartment for us to find
[6030.95s -> 6032.95s]  We went to his apartment
[6033.03s -> 6035.11s]  Mcaffrey was up on the roof
[6035.11s -> 6037.11s]  Evelyn stole the book
[6037.67s -> 6041.67s]  Mccaffrey went crazy when he found out he said he said he would put her out of her misery
[6042.31s -> 6044.31s]  He can be very cruel
[6044.47s -> 6047.77s]  That was correct. Yeah, that was it from her right hand. That's strange
[6049.14s -> 6051.05s]  She always wore it
[6051.05s -> 6051.93s]  uh
[6051.93s -> 6054.73s]  Big black circular disc with a yd in the middle
[6056.50s -> 6060.98s]  It was made from an old typewriter key present from the prop department at her old movie studio 50 percent
[6061.78s -> 6063.93s]  We're going to talk to mcaffrey
[6063.93s -> 6066.89s]  You need to think about what you've told us tiernan. You're not in the clear
[6069.16s -> 6071.00s]  Okay, so
[6071.00s -> 6078.73s]  Let's see
[6078.73s -> 6081.85s]  I got this gadget with guy putting recording devices in this place
[6082.33s -> 6084.76s]  So I have to go to the other room
[6085.91s -> 6087.91s]  Sit down. Hey, so did you do it?
[6088.87s -> 6093.78s]  I want to ask you another question
[6093.86s -> 6096.92s]  access to the tire iron
[6096.92s -> 6103.56s]  We found the lug wrench that evelyn was battered with in your apartment and the note from her mother and your blood-stained clothing
[6103.88s -> 6105.88s]  We have you cold mcaffrey
[6106.44s -> 6112.84s]  You think if I could be bothered to murder evelyn summers, I would be stupid enough to leave the evidence in my apartment
[6120.02s -> 6123.54s]  Tiernan testifies to threats of violence against victim made by
[6124.16s -> 6126.06s]  gaffrey
[6126.06s -> 6127.78s]  so
[6127.78s -> 6129.40s]  We got you
[6129.40s -> 6132.76s]  I don't believe you grovener. The evidence says that you killed her
[6133.90s -> 6136.30s]  You can prove that I wanted to kill evelyn
[6141.90s -> 6146.06s]  Tiernan is prepared to testify that you threatened evelyn's life in his presence
[6146.94s -> 6148.54s]  Self-preservation
[6148.54s -> 6150.38s]  That's understandable
[6150.38s -> 6155.80s]  Okay, i'll level with you. This guy's so weird tiernan killed evelyn
[6156.28s -> 6160.44s]  He came to me for help. I listened to him and he explained why he did it
[6160.76s -> 6165.16s]  Tiernan went to you for help. It's not to come to buy that back. That's how it went down
[6165.88s -> 6169.00s]  Back and forth a terrible mistake, but he would be throwing his life away
[6169.00s -> 6174.36s]  If he went to the cops I took his things and told him I would dispose of them, but you didn't
[6175.24s -> 6177.24s]  Speak to tiernan
[6177.32s -> 6179.32s]  Okay, god
[6179.48s -> 6182.60s]  Okay, so I now we gotta go back in there and say hey
[6183.16s -> 6187.24s]  Uh, he says you did it. Well, he did it. Well, he says you did it. Well, I say he did it
[6188.82s -> 6190.28s]  Jesus
[6190.28s -> 6196.42s]  Okay
[6196.50s -> 6204.36s]  Oops wrong way
[6204.36s -> 6210.57s]  Where's the other interview room?
[6216.42s -> 6218.42s]  No, no god
[6223.67s -> 6227.75s]  You spoken to mcaffrey I can go I hate the
[6228.55s -> 6234.23s]  Camera spin third person angle that they stuff in these have these small corridors
[6236.18s -> 6240.65s]  Okay, so
[6240.65s -> 6244.17s]  Rawlings bowling alley employee and friend. Yeah, okay. Wait, wait. So let me see
[6245.05s -> 6247.05s]  Here's this accusation
[6247.90s -> 6252.30s]  gaffer testifies to tiernan confessing and asking for help disposing of evidence
[6253.02s -> 6263.66s]  So evelyn passed out and you walked out. What happened next? I woke up in the morning
[6264.86s -> 6266.62s]  Mary hung over
[6266.62s -> 6270.39s]  I thought evelyn would have come back
[6272.71s -> 6274.74s]  Okay
[6274.74s -> 6276.34s]  Uh well
[6276.34s -> 6281.86s]  I know you're lying james. You went out looking for her. Tell me what really happened
[6282.66s -> 6285.03s]  I don't know what you're talking about
[6286.28s -> 6288.28s]  How can you say I wasn't in that hotel room?
[6289.40s -> 6292.79s]  This is a dub
[6292.79s -> 6295.43s]  Can't we just hook like something up to your brain and see what your thoughts are?
[6296.87s -> 6300.71s]  You wound up in mcaffrey's you were still incredibly drunk. You passed out on his floor
[6300.95s -> 6302.95s]  It's time to tell me what really happened
[6303.51s -> 6309.67s]  mcaffrey
[6309.75s -> 6312.39s]  Woke me up. Wait a minute. Is this for real?
[6313.91s -> 6315.91s]  He showed me the log wrench and
[6316.07s -> 6318.07s]  the letter and the box
[6318.98s -> 6322.46s]  And he said I came in with him last night
[6327.58s -> 6329.58s]  He said that I killed Evelyn
[6329.58s -> 6332.62s]  But what if he didn't though, did you? Then it was all over the radio
[6334.22s -> 6338.94s]  And he would protect me
[6338.94s -> 6342.30s]  And I don't know detective for the life of me. I can't remember a goddamn thing
[6343.34s -> 6345.51s]  I was angry with her
[6345.59s -> 6347.59s]  Really angry I could have done it
[6352.70s -> 6354.14s]  Wasn't me
[6354.14s -> 6356.02s]  I don't know
[6356.02s -> 6358.02s]  I don't know. There's not enough evidence
[6364.25s -> 6367.38s]  uh
[6367.38s -> 6369.38s]  So the scenario is
[6369.46s -> 6371.32s]  other guy
[6371.32s -> 6376.60s]  Tiernan Tiernan tells hey, I found all this stuff in your apartment and you killed this girl
[6377.24s -> 6379.99s]  And he doesn't remember anything from the night before
[6381.48s -> 6382.76s]  But what's
[6382.76s -> 6384.76s]  I don't that's too fishy for me
[6384.76s -> 6394.76s]  It's weird
[6394.76s -> 6398.73s]  He was
[6398.73s -> 6401.69s]  Wait here
[6401.69s -> 6404.44s]  Uh, is there any?
[6410.57s -> 6415.78s]  I don't know if you're I'm the other guy I think
[6420.76s -> 6424.84s]  Let me like talk to this guy one more time. I think we bust in there and find the goddamn evidence
[6425.40s -> 6428.92s]  Can I talk to you for a second?
[6428.92s -> 6430.92s]  Railroad someone else
[6430.92s -> 6432.92s]  I'm not saying anything
[6433.00s -> 6439.98s]  Uh-oh
[6439.98s -> 6442.38s]  I can't I can't talk to this guy
[6443.94s -> 6447.62s]  Phone phone phone phone. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I but

[6462.39s -> 6469.64s]  Thank you, I need the jacket on a grovener mcafee
[6480.20s -> 6491.46s]  Oh god, oh god. All right. Well, he did it. Thanks. Need a drink. I got the jitters again
[6493.82s -> 6495.98s]  Well way to make it real easy for me
[6507.74s -> 6511.34s]  James tiernan i'm charging you with the murder. Oh, well wrong guy
[6513.10s -> 6515.34s]  Oh my head. Oh, I have an instant headache
[6521.29s -> 6523.29s]  Oh
[6524.41s -> 6526.41s]  Load how do I load that scene?
[6529.13s -> 6531.13s]  I need to reload the cut scene
[6531.29s -> 6535.77s]  Oh, he didn't do it. I knew it. I just I went the wrong room and oh I
[6536.65s -> 6538.65s]  Whoa, my blood pressure just went up to like a hundred
[6540.38s -> 6542.38s]  How do how do I restart that?
[6542.46s -> 6548.36s]  That's not the guy I wanted to assume that you both have very good excuses for what happened to my station today
[6549.24s -> 6552.60s]  You had a perfectly good candidate for a capital case and some
[6552.84s -> 6555.48s]  But quit it quits. That's what was it gonna put me though, man
[6556.28s -> 6560.12s]  What's it gonna put me? What's it gonna put me?
[6566.17s -> 6573.62s]  Is it gonna be all right?
[6573.62s -> 6576.58s]  I you guys all know that's not what I want to do. I just like pressed
[6576.74s -> 6578.74s]  I was in the wrong place to press the wrong button
[6580.81s -> 6582.81s]  I you know, I solved the mystery
[6585.05s -> 6587.13s]  I just gave myself like fucking migraine
[6588.15s -> 6590.15s]  I just gotta electrocute it up here
[6601.75s -> 6604.89s]  Pretending for no, I swear to god. I just
[6605.77s -> 6607.77s]  I mixed up the names
[6608.17s -> 6618.71s]  13 if she was a day
[6618.87s -> 6621.35s]  Okay, so hold we just we we're just gonna do this again
[6622.46s -> 6626.14s]  We knew what I was gonna do. We just gotta skip ready to answer some questions
[6626.62s -> 6631.26s]  You think I have all the answers. I don't remember the things I did who run from the police usually have something to hide
[6632.14s -> 6634.14s]  to shade
[6634.62s -> 6638.70s]  Okay, so let's see where this takes us. It was the book, right?
[6640.28s -> 6644.52s]  You told us you barely knew eveline summers. She hung around sometimes
[6645.96s -> 6647.96s]  I had very little to do with her
[6649.94s -> 6655.70s]  Okay, so this is the book you'll have to do better than that grogner we know about you and eveline
[6656.10s -> 6658.66s]  Evelyn was a lush and a boring one at that
[6659.70s -> 6661.70s]  You can't link her to me
[6664.02s -> 6664.98s]  Oh
[6664.98s -> 6671.06s]  God, it gave myself a fucking migraine. We know that you thought enough of her to loan out your copy of the metaphysics
[6671.30s -> 6672.98s]  I what?
[6672.98s -> 6676.74s]  I did no such thing that bitch stole that book from my apartment
[6677.22s -> 6680.98s]  The impudent fucking moron and that made you angry angry
[6681.62s -> 6686.82s]  I was livid looking up at me with that string some more water. I have been drinking water
[6689.40s -> 6691.40s]  God damn it. Aha
[6692.10s -> 6695.58s]  Very good. That's one to you detective
[6700.10s -> 6702.10s]  Evelyn died sometime around midnight
[6702.58s -> 6704.76s]  Remind me. Where were you?
[6704.84s -> 6706.84s]  I was at home
[6707.08s -> 6708.42s]  writing
[6708.42s -> 6710.42s]  I'm working on a manuscript
[6712.02s -> 6714.02s]  Okay, that's uh, that was a lie
[6715.22s -> 6717.62s]  You're gonna need to do better if you don't want to swing for this
[6718.94s -> 6723.58s]  I was having a political meeting in my apartment cheese and crackers for the fifth column
[6723.98s -> 6731.26s]  Some of these people will corroborate your story. I won't give up names party same mistake. I'm not i'm not gonna pretend I
[6732.78s -> 6735.50s]  I'm not gonna it's either gonna be you or tiernan grobner
[6736.14s -> 6738.14s]  You want to go back and make stick?
[6738.14s -> 6740.54s]  I'm I did it wrong party has good lawyers
[6741.90s -> 6747.10s]  You want to go back? I just need to correct the mistake that I made. I'm not I don't care about the in between
[6747.58s -> 6749.58s]  I'm gonna go cheese and get a perfect score
[6752.09s -> 6754.09s]  No, that's not fair. All right telephone
[6756.30s -> 6758.30s]  Uh apparent apparently not
[6759.78s -> 6763.56s]  Telephone isn't here yet
[6763.56s -> 6767.16s]  No, I didn't cheese. I made I made a mistake and I pressed the wrong button
[6773.38s -> 6774.50s]  Fucking god
[6774.50s -> 6779.03s]  Yeah, the goddamn way nice guy. I felt lousy coloring
[6779.98s -> 6786.36s]  Why did you run tiernan? I was the last one to see ephelin that night. Okay, I knew you would think it was me
[6787.16s -> 6791.43s]  I really describe your relationship with the same mistakes
[6792.15s -> 6796.15s]  It's got to be authentic. I barely knew her bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit
[6798.41s -> 6802.01s]  Sounds like half an answer to me tiernan. Were you sleeping with her?
[6802.98s -> 6805.00s]  That's none of your business
[6805.00s -> 6810.44s]  Yep. Yep. Yep. We got that one wrong. I remember aristotle's metaphysics the book that belonged to mcaffrey
[6811.00s -> 6816.36s]  mcaffrey saw her looking at her once and laughed in her face. I'm gonna do the same things I did before and stole it
[6817.32s -> 6821.08s]  She we're not cheesing a 100 i'm doing the same answers
[6823.69s -> 6827.13s]  We either hang this on you or mcaffrey. You better give us something
[6829.10s -> 6834.30s]  Mccaffrey's been in trouble with the law before I mean he always makes out with some kind of labor dispute, but
[6834.78s -> 6837.21s]  You know, i'm not so sure
[6837.21s -> 6839.21s]  Lame streamer. How dare you? How dare you?
[6839.77s -> 6846.33s]  You and eveline were drinking together last night and she had no other place to stay. I don't know what happened last night
[6847.05s -> 6854.01s]  I don't remember liquor purchase. I've got you. You're lying tiernan. You've been fighting with her you fought
[6854.49s -> 6859.21s]  And i'm not lying. She got up and left. That was it trailer moment. By the way, that was in the trailer
[6863.21s -> 6865.05s]  She left but she came back
[6865.05s -> 6868.81s]  She bought you a quart of whiskey to make it up to you. She told the liquor store owner
[6869.37s -> 6871.67s]  You're in deep trouble, buddy
[6871.67s -> 6874.49s]  She said she loved me
[6874.57s -> 6877.46s]  She wanted to care for me
[6877.46s -> 6879.46s]  She would never stop talking about mcaffrey
[6880.42s -> 6886.10s]  And mcaffrey was a writer and mcaffrey was a hero mcaffrey cared for the little guy. Did you kill her?
[6887.70s -> 6890.82s]  Might as well. I just keep flashing back to my brain kicked her out
[6891.94s -> 6894.28s]  She had nowhere to go
[6894.28s -> 6896.20s]  access to the murder weapon
[6896.20s -> 6898.60s]  Yeah, right. Yeah, right. Yeah, right
[6899.96s -> 6903.42s]  Have access to a lug wrench
[6903.66s -> 6906.46s]  We use a lot of them to clear jams in the pin setting machines
[6909.38s -> 6911.94s]  Corner's report says that evelyn was killed with a wrench
[6912.66s -> 6916.74s]  I think you did it and then planted the evidence at mcaffrey's apartment for us to find
[6917.62s -> 6919.62s]  We went to his apartment
[6919.70s -> 6921.78s]  Mcaffrey was up on the roof
[6921.78s -> 6923.78s]  Evelyn stole the book
[6924.34s -> 6928.34s]  Mcaffrey went crazy when he found out he said he said he would put her out of her misery
[6929.06s -> 6931.06s]  He can be very cruel
[6931.78s -> 6934.50s]  Evelyn was missing a ring from her right hand. That's strange
[6935.86s -> 6937.86s]  She always wore it
[6938.66s -> 6941.46s]  Big black circular disc with a yd in the middle
[6945.06s -> 6947.14s]  Present from the prop department at her old movie studio
[6947.70s -> 6950.62s]  We're going to talk to mcaffrey
[6950.62s -> 6953.50s]  You need to think about what you've told us tiernan. You're not in a clue
[6960.89s -> 6971.77s]  That's all I hear that's all I can hear right now. All right, let's go accuse mcaffrey first
[6977.40s -> 6979.40s]  We've got an accusation that you did it
[6981.56s -> 6986.10s]  Wait back here. I've not said my piece yet
[6986.74s -> 6990.07s]  Do I have to do this first?
[6990.07s -> 6992.07s]  Why is he telling me what to do?
[6992.84s -> 6995.62s]  I can't get up
[6995.62s -> 6997.86s]  I can't get up
[6998.26s -> 7000.42s]  Why is he commanding me to to stay?
[7008.23s -> 7014.87s]  We found the lug wrench that evelyn was battered with in your apartment and the note from her mother and your blood-stained clothing
[7015.19s -> 7017.19s]  We have you cold mcaffrey
[7017.75s -> 7024.15s]  You think if I could be bothered to murder evelyn summers, I would be stupid enough to leave the evidence in my apartment
[7027.02s -> 7030.38s]  I don't believe you grovener. The evidence says that you killed her
[7031.54s -> 7033.94s]  You can prove that I wanted to kill evelyn
[7035.61s -> 7039.16s]  Yes
[7039.16s -> 7043.32s]  Tiernan is prepared to testify that you threatened evelyn's life in his presence
[7044.12s -> 7045.88s]  self-preservation
[7045.88s -> 7047.88s]  That's understandable. Oh, yeah
[7048.95s -> 7053.06s]  Okay, i'll level with you tiernan killed evelyn
[7053.54s -> 7055.06s]  He came to me for help
[7055.06s -> 7060.82s]  I listened to him and he explained why he did it tiernan went to you for help you expect me to buy that
[7061.06s -> 7063.46s]  Well, that's how it went down. That's how it went down
[7063.62s -> 7067.22s]  He made a terrible mistake, but he would be throwing his life away if he went to the cops
[7067.70s -> 7072.58s]  I took his things and told him I would dispose of them sometimes I mean depends if there's a certain scenario
[7074.42s -> 7076.17s]  He'll give it up
[7076.17s -> 7081.37s]  Okay. Thank you
[7081.37s -> 7085.05s]  Telephone call for mr. Phelps. We've got some information
[7089.13s -> 7093.82s]  Operator give me r and i putting you through now
[7096.57s -> 7098.57s]  Phelps one two four seven
[7098.73s -> 7099.77s]  tattoo
[7099.77s -> 7102.90s]  I'm uh, how could I help detective?
[7103.70s -> 7105.94s]  I need the jacket on a grovener mcaffrey
[7107.22s -> 7123.02s]  Just a moment detective different voice was formerly under surveillance by the red squad convictions for pet to death. Thank you
[7128.25s -> 7130.25s]  Okay, uh, so
[7130.81s -> 7132.57s]  Put him down with my sap
[7132.57s -> 7136.07s]  Is that all we need?
[7136.07s -> 7144.34s]  What happened here?
[7144.34s -> 7146.34s]  Do I have to do the other guy first here?
[7146.74s -> 7150.66s]  I've not said my piece yet. The thing was I was a really nice guy. I felt lousy coloring him
[7151.30s -> 7154.60s]  Who what?
[7154.60s -> 7156.92s]  You were in the war. Yes, I was
[7158.23s -> 7165.53s]  Seeing the things that I saw it changes a man. I came back here determined to change things
[7166.57s -> 7168.25s]  All I wanted was
[7168.25s -> 7169.61s]  a pen
[7169.61s -> 7174.65s]  And an opportunity to speak out you told us before that you had only minor run-ins with the police
[7175.37s -> 7180.41s]  You didn't mention petty theft i've never been in trouble for violence. That's the salient point here, isn't it?
[7183.27s -> 7187.51s]  You're lying mcaffrey. You have a history of violence towards women
[7187.83s -> 7191.75s]  How do you turn a couple parking tickets in a petty theft misdemeanor?
[7192.39s -> 7194.39s]  into an assault charge
[7194.63s -> 7196.07s]  because
[7196.07s -> 7199.34s]  We've got it
[7199.34s -> 7201.34s]  I almost just clicked this
[7204.79s -> 7206.63s]  I would have been very upset
[7206.63s -> 7208.63s]  I would have been very upset
[7209.69s -> 7215.87s]  We know all about you and your dishonorable discharge beating some poor woman near to death in syracuse
[7216.33s -> 7222.09s]  You've never been in combat mcaffrey your whole life is a fraud. She was a goddamn peasant whore
[7222.65s -> 7225.93s]  Try to steal from my wallet. I could have fought for this country
[7226.09s -> 7232.57s]  I could have you beat her because she stole from you because she tried to outsmart you the ignorant audacity of the bitch
[7233.21s -> 7235.21s]  What is a man supposed to do?
[7235.29s -> 7237.29s]  Sit there and take it
[7237.45s -> 7243.69s]  How is a man supposed to call himself a man and eveline summers a poor drunken nobody stole your book
[7244.09s -> 7246.09s]  And she got what was coming to her
[7247.16s -> 7249.48s]  Oh well, i'll see you
[7250.76s -> 7255.88s]  In the slammer mcaffrey i'm charging you with the murder of eveline. That's what was supposed to happen
[7255.88s -> 7258.68s]  She was a sad lady who never hurt anyone except herself
[7259.48s -> 7261.48s]  I hope god finds a way to forgive you
[7264.94s -> 7268.38s]  Wrong guy congratulations boys you bagged the fine catch
[7268.78s -> 7275.34s]  Another red to boot go back do it again. He didn't do it. I want you to put this business about a repeat offender out of your mind
[7276.06s -> 7279.98s]  This mcaffrey creature shows no remorse and neither will the grand jury
[7280.70s -> 7289.48s]  The walk along might a better candidate for an unmarked plot at the prison graveyard. Thanks dad
[7301.00s -> 7303.00s]  all right, so
[7303.08s -> 7306.60s]  I am going to find out first. That's not bad only
[7307.56s -> 7309.56s]  Uh, it's too much damage
[7310.62s -> 7319.91s]  No injuries though. All right, so i'm going to uh get a drink
[7321.58s -> 7323.58s]  After we get a point to stop there
[7327.32s -> 7331.16s]  We have lost most of shaughnessy and dunny squad his gunny is dead first platoon is in worse shape
[7331.24s -> 7335.48s]  That medic is the crazy the bravest man alive that we rally with the first they try for the nambus
[7335.56s -> 7339.24s]  It's seared to the left to the right. He goes right through a pass with two nambus and inflate
[7345.56s -> 7347.56s]  Peanut butter
[7349.48s -> 7351.48s]  Smoothie that sounds pretty good
[7370.39s -> 7376.98s]  We keep getting those flashbacks
[7384.04s -> 7394.50s]  Murders coming up next well done lads you did well with the summer's case
[7395.46s -> 7399.70s]  We have a problem the examiner received the new letter today. Do you mind if I take a look ray?
[7402.17s -> 7403.69s]  Go right ahead
[7403.69s -> 7408.55s]  They've both been rinsed in gasoline like the previous letters so I can't lift the print
[7414.74s -> 7420.04s]  Uh, come find me know about this message where I hid myself
[7421.82s -> 7436.46s]  Okay looking
[7436.46s -> 7441.54s]  Another snippet from the cellar looking in wonder up to heaven while yet the music peeled along
[7441.62s -> 7443.78s]  I hid myself within a fountain in the public square

[13610.65s -> 13615.32s]  Duck stir. Oh, he has jose rames in his pocket
[13616.12s -> 13619.00s]  Ramos must have forgotten his lucky dollars in no sense

[13631.61s -> 13636.09s]  I'm not going nowhere. I've paid my contributions and i'm not getting hustled by you
[13636.57s -> 13644.35s]  We're only interested in morphine army surplus morphine. What do you have to say about that? I heard about that
[13644.99s -> 13647.08s]  Big robbery on the ship
[13647.08s -> 13650.92s]  Ain't my line of work. I prefer something with a sporting outcome
[13653.55s -> 13654.51s]  Lie
[13654.51s -> 13665.05s]  Okay, merlin behave like a moron the two dead guys. I'm telling the da that you sold them the hop

[13668.73s -> 13673.87s]  And clear motherfucker I have chips and i'm not throwing my cards in this easy
[13677.71s -> 13680.91s]  Rames seems to owe you a lot of money. We all owe somebody
[13681.47s -> 13693.00s]  That's it
[13693.00s -> 13695.72s]  Okay, so it has nothing to do with the proceeds of the morphine shipment
[13696.65s -> 13698.33s]  It's a gambling debt
[13698.33s -> 13703.93s]  The heaps took over the wise service and screwed me now. I just do what i'm told run numbers and ship dope
[13704.57s -> 13706.33s]  Jose's no different

[13734.25s -> 13736.25s]  I didn't make it because I made it already
[13738.19s -> 13742.41s]  I almost wish I said it now
[13742.41s -> 13744.41s]  That's unfortunate. I was gonna say it
[13754.28s -> 13757.48s]  Mickey cohen runs the dope rack always sonny theme plays
[13758.04s -> 13760.04s]  All right, Mickey does what he's told
[13760.44s -> 13766.00s]  Benny siegel will take a cover his operation going. I thought jack dragnet was
[13766.96s -> 13770.72s]  Dragging is an old-time greaser. He keeps his head down and pays his dues
[13771.20s -> 13773.20s]  Word is he's gonna clip bugsy
[13774.08s -> 13775.76s]  Who's word?

[13781.48s -> 13796.65s]  I'm just gonna go here
[13800.48s -> 13803.76s]  I already arrested the guy you can't do anything on maybe
[13805.04s -> 13810.73s]  Sounds like me singing
[13810.73s -> 13817.76s]  Don't take notes while you drive. That's true. You shouldn't do anything like that
[13828.03s -> 13830.03s]  Thank god, we're not in my car
[13831.90s -> 13836.38s]  Well, that's because I destroyed your car in front of you and I've burnt it so
[13837.82s -> 13840.06s]  I don't know what you mean by that exactly
[13841.40s -> 13843.40s]  god damn maniac
[13843.48s -> 13854.03s]  Is there a penalty for running people over there's a penalty for doing any damage at all

[13859.95s -> 13861.95s]  every single fender bender
[13862.35s -> 13871.40s]  I thought it was this store. I thought it was that store and we were gonna get a cut scene quite enough. I thought

[15398.01s -> 15409.48s]  I think I have to pick that up again and move it. He's right there. I tried
[15423.24s -> 15426.14s]  Block the door again
[15426.14s -> 15432.73s]  All right. What do you uh
[15433.79s -> 15435.79s]  some kind of shortcut
[15439.21s -> 15440.35s]  or
[15440.35s -> 15442.44s]  What?
[15442.44s -> 15455.04s]  Now block him in
[15455.04s -> 15457.98s]  No, i'm not jumping
[15457.98s -> 15459.98s]  I'm not i'm not restarting this mission
[15462.64s -> 15466.70s]  I think we know where the water's coming from. You're gonna want to see this
[15467.74s -> 15472.44s]  Yep
[15472.44s -> 15477.56s]  Uh, I think frozen inside. No, i'm not gonna make it and what I was gonna say was a mosquito or like a jurassic park
[15477.88s -> 15479.88s]  Fucking fossil whatever
[15480.36s -> 15498.72s]  Uh, okay. I'll be damned
[15502.27s -> 15506.97s]  Giant jenga. I've played this at a bar before this must be how they transport them
[15530.09s -> 15533.29s]  Leave it right there everyone out of the vehicle and put your hands up
[15534.52s -> 15536.52s]  There's something in the ice
[15536.76s -> 15539.56s]  He's making a run for it. There's something in the ice
[15541.92s -> 15542.88s]  Oh
[15542.88s -> 15544.16s]  Get him
[15544.16s -> 15547.36s]  No, don't lose me in the furniture maze. I'm wide open here fuck
[15548.24s -> 15549.68s]  Oh, no
[15549.68s -> 15566.44s]  He's dead
[15566.44s -> 15568.44s]  I think no he's good
[15569.85s -> 15573.53s]  Take them all to hollywood station have the me and tech services go over this place
[15574.67s -> 15581.55s]  What will you be hunting polar bear polar golf polar bear ice golf?
[15582.35s -> 15589.24s]  Is otty serious is the lappd turning a blind eye to narcotics
[15590.12s -> 15593.13s]  Keep your shirt on felps
[15593.68s -> 15596.64s]  Drugs are prohibited doesn't mean people don't want to take them
[15597.52s -> 15600.08s]  Limiting supply doesn't mean that we have limited demand
[15601.82s -> 15606.06s]  I understand that I know that the average joe needs to unwind my plans on the switch
[15606.94s -> 15608.86s]  Is this this is orphan switch heroin?
[15610.76s -> 15613.88s]  It's important to demonize hop phelps. It looks good in the papers
[15614.44s -> 15617.24s]  But when all is said and done, it's just another chemical like booze
[15618.04s -> 15623.24s]  A lot of people in high places think we're doing the city a favor by keeping the dope rolling into central avenue
[15623.96s -> 15626.62s]  Donnelly certainly believes we need to keep them anesthetized
[15628.52s -> 15630.92s]  Better jobs and opportunities would go a lot further
[15632.60s -> 15634.60s]  Will you listen to yourself
[15641.45s -> 15642.65s]  No
[15642.65s -> 15650.00s]  I don't think so
[15650.00s -> 15668.11s]  Landmark. Oh, that's right. This is his car
[15668.91s -> 15679.39s]  Must have gotten fixed. I missed a turn audit
[15685.34s -> 15687.50s]  You're paying for every last scratch
[15688.70s -> 15699.18s]  For years
[15699.18s -> 15705.50s]  Not much call for ice anymore with all those newfangled refrigerators save it for someone who wants to hear it
[15706.14s -> 15708.14s]  How many janitors carry a gap?
[15716.20s -> 15721.40s]  Give it up finkelstein your brother-in-law will get you a good lawyer. My brother-in-law hates my guts
[15722.04s -> 15724.76s]  Come and get me if you want some daylight for that suit of yours
[15726.04s -> 15728.04s]  Well, that's three
[15728.12s -> 15742.08s]  I'm trying to just get him really quickly
[15753.16s -> 15755.16s]  Damn it
[15765.36s -> 15775.10s]  What don't do it again don't do it again throw out the guns
[15779.02s -> 15787.53s]  I didn't hit him at all. I didn't hit him in the face. Oh, you had a spark head there
[15788.41s -> 15797.48s]  Here easy
[15805.76s -> 15818.36s]  Push forward pick up what like my god
[15819.40s -> 15821.40s]  What is this like?
[15823.40s -> 15825.15s]  I'm gonna say
[15825.15s -> 15835.21s]  All dead finkelstein leave the weapon and put your hands up now
[15836.30s -> 15840.06s]  Put my hands up it says press x to pick up weapon
[15840.78s -> 15846.46s]  But it doesn't actually mean it you have to be standing on the weapon some old friend puts a an ice pick above my ear
[15846.78s -> 15849.58s]  No, thanks only one other way out shit heel
[15852.30s -> 15859.72s]  Let's have a look around now that we finally got some peace and quiet
[15862.84s -> 15864.84s]  I think i've had enough ice for one day
[15865.72s -> 15868.68s]  Until the scotch I pour myself as soon as we get out of here
[15870.62s -> 15875.50s]  Three guess is what's in the box open her up col. It's gonna be drugs
[15875.98s -> 15880.14s]  Yeah, there it is. This stuff has got to be worth at least a hundred grand
[15881.18s -> 15883.18s]  So finkelstein robbed the ship
[15884.46s -> 15886.54s]  My guess is lenny took it off their hands
[15887.34s -> 15889.55s]  This is big
[15889.55s -> 15891.55s]  This is going to make the papers felps
[15891.87s -> 15893.87s]  As senior investigator i'll do the talking
[15894.51s -> 15905.45s]  biggest drug bust ever
[15905.45s -> 15911.61s]  Well, well who would have thought that roy earl's hand-picked new partner would have turned out to be such a great case, man
[15912.65s -> 15916.01s]  This is a good result felps as far as we can tell lenny
[15916.01s -> 15919.85s]  The fink was moving the morphine across the city and as far north as frisco
[15920.41s -> 15924.49s]  This makes the feds very happy and it makes mickey cohen look bad
[15925.21s -> 15927.48s]  Don't lie to you kid
[15927.48s -> 15929.32s]  I like the headlines
[15929.32s -> 15931.32s]  I like them a lot
[15931.80s -> 15936.20s]  You keep this squad in the papers and we'll get along just fine
[15937.64s -> 15952.03s]  I did it case report
[15953.31s -> 15955.55s]  Not that great, but not it's very
[15960.27s -> 15964.75s]  The death of lenny finkelstein should keep administrative vice in the headlines for now
[15980.11s -> 15982.11s]  You know a freddy calhoun
[15982.83s -> 15985.79s]  Sure, I know freddy needs money to get out of town
[15986.59s -> 15991.23s]  Says he's prepared to blow i'm not looking at it. It's a wild tangent distribution ring
[15991.87s -> 15998.99s]  Says he said how much it's gonna cost 50 bucks and the department will front me the 50 you can put in an expense claim
[15999.87s -> 16003.15s]  He's over at mike lineman's on hollywood boulevard. See what you can find out
[16009.95s -> 16011.95s]  All right. Um I
[16013.50s -> 16017.76s]  Unfortunately looking at my phone a couple of times here. I have to make a few phone calls
[16020.12s -> 16022.51s]  About important matters
[16027.21s -> 16029.21s]  I need to make two phone calls
[16031.15s -> 16033.15s]  So I have to go
[16034.65s -> 16035.53s]  uh
[16035.53s -> 16037.45s]  Don't worry. Everything's fine. It's just about
[16038.41s -> 16040.33s]  a couple of
[16040.33s -> 16047.04s]  loose ends that need time
[16047.04s -> 16048.96s]  so I need to um
[16048.96s -> 16050.96s]  I got a skedaddle while it's still
[16052.30s -> 16059.02s]  Uh, what time is it? It's still it's still not even midnight. Oh, yeah, I gotta make I have I gotta go
[16059.66s -> 16061.66s]  Oh, I gotta go. I gotta get out of here
[16061.98s -> 16062.94s]  um
[16062.94s -> 16065.04s]  But i'll be live tomorrow
[16065.04s -> 16067.68s]  Uh, this should give us just enough time to go through the bits
[16068.72s -> 16073.60s]  Just make your calls and come back. Uh, that's that's not gonna happen
[16074.75s -> 16078.03s]  i'll probably be on the phone for like 30 or 40 minutes and at that point, uh, it's
[16079.23s -> 16082.99s]  12 30 one o'clock in the morning eastern might as well just start again tomorrow
[16083.55s -> 16085.55s]  So the plan tomorrow is you'll see
[16086.27s -> 16088.27s]  Not the green screen green screen is thursday
[16089.98s -> 16090.86s]  but

[16102.59s -> 16104.11s]  Not delta rune
[16104.11s -> 16108.89s]  Something else something else
[16110.65s -> 16112.41s]  A pumpkin carving
[16112.41s -> 16120.09s]  Nope
[16120.17s -> 16123.53s]  What's the I have to make two phone calls each one is going to last probably
[16124.09s -> 16125.93s]  15 to 20 minutes each
[16125.93s -> 16131.32s]  Maybe more so that's where the 40 plus minutes comes from
[16133.48s -> 16137.80s]  And at that point it's gonna be kind of too late to come back I think to start another stream
[16140.44s -> 16142.76s]  Yeah, I guess one of them is my mother. That's correct
[16146.57s -> 16149.95s]  You are correct

[16606.86s -> 16609.42s]  Will you do another one with that another murder stream?
[16611.34s -> 16616.38s]  I don't know maybe that probably not though because that was like I can't I don't like going back and doing
[16617.50s -> 16619.18s]  stuff that I already did
[16619.18s -> 16620.78s]  because
[16620.78s -> 16626.46s]  At some point, you know, it was so interesting and so funny to me that going and doing it again is like
[16627.20s -> 16628.80s]  And we're doing it again
[16628.80s -> 16632.56s]  Remember the thing we did again. I don't know. I feel like i'd like to keep that
[16633.34s -> 16638.60s]  preserved
[16638.60s -> 16642.68s]  But thank you. We'll see i'll take a look i'll take a look at that, you know in quotes
[16645.63s -> 16650.35s]  Uh, thank you. Dr. Clay at the end here for five dollars finally get a chance to join the stream in the beginning this time
[16650.99s -> 16655.07s]  With your new schedule. It's a little hard to join the stream live because I tend to be at work when you start
[16655.71s -> 16657.55s]  Thanks for the stream today
[16657.55s -> 16662.75s]  Yeah, i'll have a more clear schedule probably start after the green screen stream is when i'm gonna really
[16663.55s -> 16666.04s]  hunger down here and
[16666.04s -> 16668.49s]  Get all that done
[16668.49s -> 16671.37s]  I would say but in my opinion the green screen stream
[16672.19s -> 16674.27s]  is like the start of
[16675.64s -> 16681.88s]  Here we go. Here comes more streams. Here comes like the stream shit these this last week or so
[16682.44s -> 16686.91s]  I mean remember i've the internet's been all fucked up and i've been moving and stuff
[16686.91s -> 16690.27s]  So these last week or so of streams have just been
[16691.47s -> 16697.10s]  Hey, i'm i'm here and i've had a lot of fun red dad has been fucking a ton of fun
[16697.18s -> 16699.37s]  La noir has been a lot of fun, too
[16699.37s -> 16703.45s]  But i'm still trying to get back into the swing of things and this week has been what that's been
[16710.40s -> 16715.74s]  But we'll see how it goes. Thank you though and let's do the credits
[16717.80s -> 16722.04s]  The credits are going to roll right now. Thank you everybody for your continued support
[16722.04s -> 16727.63s]  You guys are amazing all the subs old subs new subs and I will see you tomorrow
[16728.11s -> 16732.33s]  He's been moving for six months
[16732.57s -> 16734.81s]  Oh, well, not really i'm here now
[16735.53s -> 16739.44s]  He does the credits after the bits. Well
[16740.32s -> 16742.62s]  people have subscribed
[16742.78s -> 16746.40s]  During the bit sometimes the bit readings can go an hour
[16747.32s -> 16750.84s]  sometimes, you know 20 30 40 minutes hour two hours and
[16751.80s -> 16754.76s]  You know people subscribe during that so I figured I'd just do it after
[16757.92s -> 16759.92s]  Remember when bits were two hours?
[16760.78s -> 16762.25s]  uh
[16762.25s -> 16764.89s]  Well, also remember another thing to keep in mind is
[16765.93s -> 16770.25s]  During my normal stream schedule, it would be you know, four to six hours three times a week
[16770.81s -> 16774.27s]  right
[16774.27s -> 16776.43s]  I've been streaming every pretty much every single day for
[16777.23s -> 16779.23s]  seven to ten hours a day
[16780.57s -> 16782.57s]  Why are the credits off to the side a little?
[16784.28s -> 16794.12s]  Um, I didn't even know that thanks. That would mean more bits. Well that
[16794.60s -> 16798.27s]  Whatever
[16798.27s -> 16801.90s]  That's fine. That's not
[16801.90s -> 16806.38s]  Streaming longer doesn't necessarily mean more like money from people giving bits
[16807.34s -> 16813.42s]  It just just kind of you know, people give money. They give money. That's how I see it
[16813.42s -> 16819.18s]  I don't i'm not putting like a a quota of how much money and bits that I have to receive per stream
[16819.18s -> 16820.54s]  That's just
[16820.54s -> 16828.84s]  You should play more old school games too many triple a titles recently
[16829.88s -> 16832.19s]  You mean red dead redemption?
[16832.19s -> 16837.00s]  That's the only one
[16837.00s -> 16841.32s]  I played lethal league with star and then la noir which came out like seven years ago
[16842.04s -> 16846.78s]  That's all i've done since being coming back
[16847.50s -> 16856.46s]  You know, it's still triple a
[16860.04s -> 16862.22s]  Well, I mean
[16864.68s -> 16866.68s]  I I well here's the thing right?
[16868.17s -> 16872.14s]  It's kind of like damned if you do damned if you don't so like red dead
[16872.14s -> 16874.62s]  I started red dead and I stream red dead four times in a row
[16875.42s -> 16876.62s]  and
[16876.62s -> 16878.70s]  If I stop playing red dead completely
[16879.50s -> 16884.06s]  There's probably a lot of people here that'd be like why won't you do what do you want to go do red dead again?
[16884.14s -> 16886.14s]  Why are you leaving red dead?
[16886.30s -> 16890.19s]  You know, i'll go play something else and then three days go by go back to red dead
[16890.91s -> 16896.70s]  It's trying to do a balance, you know
[16905.90s -> 16908.70s]  And plus all these these are all these huge
[16909.66s -> 16912.70s]  You know five ten year in the making games like red dead redemption two
[16913.34s -> 16917.50s]  Is specifically is more than five ten years in the making
[16918.46s -> 16922.06s]  So it's not like a typical I don't really play that many triple a games to begin with
[16924.46s -> 16929.63s]  You know like for the most part I kind of just do whatever
[16935.47s -> 16940.75s]  but that's one of those titles that I would like to experience and play and have fun with everybody with because it's just
[16942.12s -> 16944.52s]  It's it's just the new rock star game that
[16946.04s -> 16948.60s]  It's just so there's so much to do and so much to see
[16951.64s -> 16953.64s]  But I will see you all tomorrow
[16954.44s -> 16959.00s]  Have a fantastic rest of your night. Make sure it didn't miss any bits of the very end here. I did not
[16963.69s -> 16965.69s]  So much to do so much to see
[16966.01s -> 16970.97s]  Sure, but it's always been it's almost you cannot tie loose ends up at midnight
[16971.85s -> 16974.99s]  Yeah, i'm gonna turn to a pumpkin
[16974.99s -> 16979.44s]  But i'll see you tomorrow. We're gonna do something different. Don't worry. We're doing something different tomorrow
[16980.08s -> 16988.43s]  What is it auto? I'll see you guys bro. Have a good night. Goodbye. Take care
