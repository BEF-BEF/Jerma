[31.74s -> 37.91s]  I told you I was going to be precisely on time. I said it. I said I'm going to be on time today.
[39.56s -> 60.71s]  I was 10 seconds early. It's on time. I don't believe it. What's going on? Well, this time
[60.71s -> 75.66s]  I'm not I'm not on the ground. I am seated this time. I'm not on the ground. I have some changes
[75.66s -> 97.35s]  to my setup. I'm very happy with it. I had a dream you were playing Tears of the Kingdom.
[97.91s -> 115.74s]  Well, that sounds like a nightmare to me. I'm just kidding around. We finally made it on time.
[115.74s -> 123.29s]  Uh, give me one second. I want to drink needs a refill. I guess I've been doing this thing.
[123.29s -> 131.19s]  I've been doing water, but like 10% watermelon juice. It's been pretty great. Actually,
[131.99s -> 135.83s]  you get a little bit of flavor, but it's not all sugar and bullshit. It's been pretty great. Give
[135.83s -> 345.26s]  me one second. Okay. Hi. Uh, that was weird. I hope that doesn't happen again. Otherwise I'm
[345.26s -> 351.10s]  going to have to figure this out and I'll have to see you another time. Okay. So let me explain.
[351.98s -> 358.28s]  I may have tripped a breaker, but it's not like I'm, I'm just in a different room.
[358.92s -> 365.00s]  It's not like I'm doing any more. I browned out. I had a brownout.
[365.40s -> 372.06s]  How did I overload this? It's not like I added any equipment. What the hell happened?
[372.86s -> 381.88s]  Dude, this, this might happen again. I don't know. I was using the setup for like a couple of hours
[381.88s -> 390.10s]  yesterday. Maybe the streaming is like pulling extra power and tripping the breaker. Okay. Well,
[391.06s -> 396.10s]  everybody cross your fingers. That doesn't happen again, but, uh, I'm fully prepared. If it does
[396.98s -> 400.58s]  in the event, it does. I'm going to have to do a little bit of investigating
[406.98s -> 412.31s]  road to advanced. I mean, I'm sitting in a recliner right now. I did. It's not like I'm
[412.31s -> 420.84s]  streaming from a space station. Anyways. Hey, it wouldn't be a stream that I do unless something
[420.84s -> 425.08s]  goes horribly wrong for no reason. Right. I mean that I have to just accept it at this point.
[427.48s -> 431.56s]  Hey guys, I changed my whole setup. Spent the last like few days getting it all set up and all
[431.56s -> 438.60s]  these things. I got a recliner now. I got this cool custom made computer setup. Oh, oh, oh, you,
[438.60s -> 448.04s]  wait, you thought I was going to be able to stream. Time to brown out my breaker. Well,
[448.04s -> 451.88s]  that's actually, that's really good to know because that means that there's
[452.84s -> 457.24s]  essentially something to do with like the circuit that I'm on. Maybe I have to try plugging into a
[457.24s -> 460.76s]  different outlet. I don't know. I'll have to figure that out. Anyways. Uh, we'll see if it
[460.76s -> 466.68s]  keeps going. If we are fine, we're fine. And if not, if the stream turns off again and hey, it's
[466.68s -> 476.66s]  okay. I'll figure it out. We'll see you another day, but I'm here now and uh, yeah, getting brown
[476.66s -> 489.03s]  outs in your thirties. Oh, I see the joke. Okay. No, that's all right. All right. We'll find out.
[489.59s -> 494.31s]  Uh, I'm actually kind of scared that it's going to happen again, but anyways, good to see you
[495.64s -> 506.76s]  today. We're going to be playing resident evil four, a separate ways DLC. That's the plan.
[506.76s -> 512.50s]  Don't jinx it. Yeah. I got to keep my mouth shut about this now, but yeah, we're going to play a
[512.50s -> 519.67s]  DLC. I'm streaming from a new setup. Like you said, like you said, like I said, I am officially
[519.67s -> 525.14s]  in a recliner. I will show you, I'll be on cam for a little bit tonight. We are playing a scary game.
[525.86s -> 531.77s]  Everybody say your prayers that we don't get an electrical brown out again. Okay. Well, anyways,
[533.77s -> 542.95s]  yeah, I'm in a recliner. This is the new setup. Gets me more comfortable. I can actually sit back
[542.95s -> 546.47s]  now because before, I think I mentioned it when I was on the ground. Cause when I, when I was
[546.47s -> 551.11s]  lying on the ground last stream, it was not, I was not even 20% of the way through setting this
[551.11s -> 562.09s]  new setup up, but let's take a look. You want to see? I'll show you. There's the game. I'm going
[562.09s -> 566.70s]  to hit start game and it's going to draw extra power and it's going to turn the computer off.
[566.70s -> 572.28s]  I'm fucking scared to click. Yes. Let go. Oh my God. It scared the shit out of me. You can hear
[572.28s -> 580.60s]  it. I thought my computer browned out. All right, hold on. Here we go. All right. You ready? Here
[580.60s -> 594.50s]  we go. Recliner. I told you I was going to be sitting in a chair. I have this over. This is
[594.50s -> 597.30s]  not the final setup, by the way. And a lot of people were like, wow, you're just in a chair
[597.30s -> 603.37s]  this time. Look at this background over here. You got a mustache. Yep. Well, whatever you could
[603.37s -> 611.72s]  call it. No Reddit shelf. Hold on. Not done yet. I'm missing two or three very important pieces,
[611.72s -> 618.98s]  but when they get here, oh yeah, I've got a few things I really need to get. I need a different
[618.98s -> 623.56s]  little table over here. I need a whole section. I'm not completed yet. I still have to go get it.
[624.12s -> 631.80s]  Why don't I have the, why am I doing umpire Albertson again? There's a reason. There's a
[631.80s -> 640.07s]  reason. No, I'm not. I'm not an umpire again. I'm just saying there's a reason. I want to have a
[640.07s -> 653.30s]  mustache. Is that, is that so weird? And you look like a mafia boss. Come here. You, come here. Make
[653.30s -> 657.46s]  the cam smaller. Yeah. I just want to show you my, uh, my cool Pac-Man thing that I got there.
[657.46s -> 666.54s]  It makes me happy. My hair is a mess. I gotta work on that. Yeah. This is the setup temporarily. It's
[666.54s -> 674.42s]  not quite there, but it will be shrink this a little. Yeah. I can, I can actually go like this
[674.42s -> 681.64s]  now. This is how you should be streaming. Those of you streamers that are watching right now.
[681.64s -> 688.47s]  Oh, you're doing it completely wrong. I was doing it wrong for 10 years. Being able to do this. I
[688.47s -> 696.04s]  got the keyboard right here. I got the mouse on a table that's connected to the recliner armchair.
[696.04s -> 703.32s]  I've got all my little, uh, my little things over here. I've got my knobs over here. You're going to
[703.32s -> 711.24s]  get seasick. Like puke. Please don't turn the fucking, please don't have the computer turned
[711.24s -> 717.74s]  off again. I'm like terrified right now. I went, it's, this is so, of course it has to happen on
[717.74s -> 722.66s]  my stream, right? I sat down, I was wicked relaxed. I was like, Oh, I can't wait to fucking play
[723.22s -> 731.11s]  a Resident Evil's DLC in my new comfortable setup. And now I'm no longer comfortable.
[731.11s -> 746.12s]  Now I'm like, is my computer going to turn all the power off? But Hey, it is what it is. But
[746.12s -> 751.64s]  all right. I'm ready to play. I'm ready to chill and hang out and play the DLC. Look at this. Oh,
[751.64s -> 766.23s]  yeah. Okay. Separate ways, right? I'm just ready to go. Are we ready? Trim your toenails? Nah,
[767.03s -> 773.54s]  I'm just going to keep them going. Uh, only separate ways challenges can be earned in the,
[773.54s -> 778.38s]  okay. Yeah. That's fine. Costumes and accessories set in the extras menu will be applied. Yeah.
[778.38s -> 792.38s]  We already know all this. Wait, different. Whoa, wait, hold on a second. Oh, right. I already have
[792.38s -> 805.11s]  all these. So what should I do for a costume? Your new setup has a weird camera angle. Well,
[805.11s -> 808.71s]  this is temporary. This is a lot of this is going to move back. You're going to be able to see the
[808.71s -> 814.12s]  Reddit shelf when I decide to do cam, I'm not going to do it every time. Right. But the romantic.
[814.12s -> 823.82s]  Yeah, sure. This is really is, is Leon even in this? I guess so. Isn't it a storyline?
[823.82s -> 834.41s]  And who cares? Let's just go. Uh, I'm retired. So I'm just gonna play on standard. Do pinstripe.
[834.41s -> 856.18s]  All right. That scene. All right. Those of you that don't know, this takes place at the same
[856.18s -> 864.17s]  time as the other game. And you cross paths and shit. It's way too loud. I can't even hear
[864.17s -> 902.65s]  myself talk. Who is? Why is he dancing? I don't know. I think because he knows he's going to
[902.65s -> 921.66s]  escape. It's just a complete overconfidence. Turn the game up. You got it. Am I? I might
[921.66s -> 942.20s]  have to change some of the audio adjustments here, though. Oh, I was sick. There's no way
[942.20s -> 957.80s]  to finish a dance. All right. Is it weird that for one second I did not know that was Ada?
[957.80s -> 970.94s]  I was like, oh, oh, yeah, of course, that was Ada in the costume. Many things. You see,
[970.94s -> 980.23s]  how some annoying monks took everything from me, including the amber, never hidden just before
[980.23s -> 990.02s]  they grabbed me. Well, then lead the way. All right. Here we go. You guys ready? Scary game.
[990.02s -> 998.01s]  So the camera has to be on this way. All right. I did play this last night just to get the controls
[998.01s -> 1001.93s]  down again. I kind of remember, but I kind of don't. You know that. All right. Let me turn it
[1001.93s -> 1019.69s]  up. We're saying it is low. Up all the way. It's weird. I think it's all right now. What do you
[1019.69s -> 1031.74s]  want with it anyway? Yeah, I think I actually I if I do that too much, I will puke. I actually
[1031.74s -> 1057.78s]  have to be careful. Is it? No, it's hold. Right. That arc. That's right. I'm going full dad mode.
[1072.41s -> 1084.18s]  Boss fight. I hope they give us a boss fight immediately.
[1088.97s -> 1098.10s]  Then we meet at the church. Let's not make it a funeral.
[1098.98s -> 1105.32s]  Is that do we actually have to do this right now? Oh, should I have to be ready?
[1105.88s -> 1138.52s]  Let's beat it. Ada has a machine gun. That's pretty cool. Oh, OK. It has a machine gun.
[1139.69s -> 1155.35s]  Oh, that's pretty cool. All right. All right. With the black robe, I can parry, right? Oh,
[1155.35s -> 1169.19s]  no, it's evade, not parry. C is evade. I might want to change that. Does Ada have like a move
[1169.19s -> 1185.90s]  where you can punch? Oh, I thought I killed it. I thought it was dead. I don't. Was this in the
[1185.90s -> 1200.33s]  original? I don't remember this. I don't run out of bullets. Oh, my God. They're everywhere.
[1200.89s -> 1234.06s]  Where's the real one? I got there's a real one. You know, died of him. Well, I just killed it.
[1234.06s -> 1237.74s]  All right. Where's the map? There's a map. OK, this is my favorite part where you go find every
[1237.74s -> 1253.43s]  item machine gun. Very cool. Volume is still low. Yeah, that's very strange considering.
[1254.74s -> 1260.68s]  I'll turn it up all the way up and I'll figure out later, but we'll just keep it up all the way.
[1260.68s -> 1291.19s]  Tell me if it's if it's too. Let's see. Oh, that's fine. Standard Andy, right? Hmm. Thank
[1291.19s -> 1304.26s]  you for telling me this. Five thousand people are about to scream it at me. Can I get in here?
[1304.26s -> 1316.79s]  You're covering up the weapon indicator. Oh, I got to go. Can I go up here? Is up here better?
[1316.79s -> 1335.78s]  Probably unfathomable. Remember, every time I do a Boston accent, I have to kind of move like this.
[1335.78s -> 1346.90s]  Oh, is that gunpowder? Why is that? Why? Control come in. Louise hit the amber, but I've sent him
[1346.90s -> 1362.58s]  to retrieve it. Control, do you copy? I'm listening. Into some unexpected trouble.
[1362.58s -> 1370.18s]  Wesker. Louise is already on route to the church. I'm tracking him every step of the way. Then I
[1370.18s -> 1378.78s]  suggest you hurry. Copy. Just need to confirm my route first. Heading out to get a visual of the
[1378.86s -> 1394.70s]  area. Whoa. All right. Hold on. I tried to run. It's a run. I was trying to sprint because I was
[1394.70s -> 1399.43s]  going to look around. That scared the shit out of me for some reason. I don't know why.
[1399.43s -> 1417.35s]  OK, I want to go back down there. I wasn't done. Stick to that. I got to get over there.
[1417.99s -> 1424.71s]  All right. All the way across there. So it's a lot. It's gonna be a lot of grappling.
[1434.42s -> 1442.73s]  OK, I want to collect items. I got to go. Headshots only for 10 straight minutes. Start
[1442.73s -> 1456.52s]  the clock once. Grapple gun. Oh, that's right. OK, cool. That's what her melee is.
[1457.24s -> 1485.99s]  I probably shouldn't have done that. Can I restart? Please let me just let me restart.
[1485.99s -> 1492.47s]  I'm restarting because I got hit by the meteor. I got hit by the fucking meteor. Hold on a second.
[1492.47s -> 1504.44s]  I got hit by the meteor. Just give me one minute. I got a new setup. I got to get used to. I'm too
[1504.44s -> 1516.81s]  comfy. I'm getting too comfortable. Maybe I should just not do that. Maybe I just not attack yet.
[1516.81s -> 1542.17s]  I can sneak up on people, right? Yeah, don't shoot me, buddy. What am I doing?
[1542.81s -> 1559.50s]  Oh, OK. Can I get up there? It'd be this close. Yeah, I looked down to see where she was.
[1561.75s -> 1580.25s]  Get over it. Oh, give me these bra. Don't. Hey, don't you rob me. I need to look sometimes.
[1580.25s -> 1603.82s]  It's a new computer just right there. It's got to be some kind of achievement, right?
[1603.82s -> 1626.81s]  Kill everybody without enough the alarm. All right. Get away from the meteor. Is it still
[1626.81s -> 1637.10s]  falling? How long does it take to land? I want it. This is why I came down here.
[1637.10s -> 1648.49s]  Oh, yeah, I'll take the jewels. Very good. Very cool. Very cool. Oh, my God. They're raining
[1648.49s -> 1663.26s]  hell. They're going to come out of his head. No, we're good. I got to kill the person on the
[1663.26s -> 1690.31s]  catapult, right? Oh, didn't hurt me. I'm fine. Stop shooting these at me. Oh, my God. I hate
[1690.31s -> 1742.07s]  these things. Oh, cool. Red herb. All right. Where? I need a grapple hook area. You look like
[1742.07s -> 1782.04s]  my dad. All right. I can't. Hold on a second. Where's the grapple hook? Am I safe down here?
[1782.04s -> 1796.04s]  I don't think so. You look like the owner of this castle. That's actually pretty good.
[1797.56s -> 1810.44s]  That was actually very good. That was an 11 out of 10. All right. There goes one.
[1814.52s -> 1826.90s]  Shit. Okay. So where can I go from here? There's got to be a grapple hook from here, right?
[1827.54s -> 1832.63s]  They wouldn't have emphasized the grapple hook if I couldn't use it a lot more frequently than I am
[1832.63s -> 1842.23s]  right now. Down to the ground level? You look like Gabby J, 10 years younger. Oh, that's actually
[1842.23s -> 1854.54s]  awesome. You look like a handyman. All right, keep them coming. These are great. What are these
[1854.54s -> 1867.77s]  doing over there, huh? Hey, what? You got a problem with your sink? Hey, give me a call.
[1868.41s -> 1877.74s]  I'm not going to fix it. I'm going to fuck it up. No more talking. That's about to kill me.
[1877.74s -> 1898.12s]  Where's the grapple hook? I don't think I can go that way. Can I? They gave me the grapple
[1898.12s -> 1913.62s]  hook tutorial and I only used it once. Dude, where's the grapple hook? She's like, oh yeah,
[1913.62s -> 1924.39s]  I'll use my grapple hook to get over there. Oh, just kidding. It's in one spot. Oh, wait.
[1924.95s -> 1946.89s]  You look like the third Mario brother. I like that one too. Okay. What the hell is going on here?
[1948.82s -> 1960.34s]  I can't reach from here. Can I reach with this grenade? What the fuck is going on?
[1960.90s -> 1987.85s]  Somebody help? Why do I not understand what's going on here? You have to go down? Well,
[1987.85s -> 1991.29s]  when I, when I walked over here, it was just unloading these bombs that I couldn't keep
[1991.29s -> 2003.32s]  walking and there's no grapple hook. Come on, Jack. Raise the cannon. Oh my God. This is okay.
[2003.32s -> 2007.56s]  This is what happens when you don't play a game and a DLC comes out like four months later.
[2009.34s -> 2020.30s]  That's right. I forgot that thing existed. All right. How do I open it up? How do I get in there?
[2044.79s -> 2052.65s]  Dude, how do I get in this fucking room? Okay. There it is. All right. Now we can start playing.
[2052.65s -> 2058.54s]  This'll do nicely.
[2063.80s -> 2080.68s]  Jesus Christ. I thought I was supposed to use the grapple hook and like,
[2083.70s -> 2087.22s]  no, shoot him with the cannon. Like in the regular game that you played.
[2095.51s -> 2144.84s]  Thanks. All right, let's go. All right. There we go. Now this is what I thought
[2144.84s -> 2166.10s]  I was going to be doing. Oh shit. No, I'm not. Oh, that hurt. Actually, you know what?
[2174.86s -> 2183.80s]  Uh, I have to use this now, don't I? No. Wait, is it red and green does extra health or you have
[2183.80s -> 2206.50s]  to do all three, right? So I shouldn't use that. Be very careful. How did that miss?
[2211.51s -> 2220.73s]  What are these cannonballs? Like tiny little bowling balls? Like candle pin? Yeah, they are.
[2221.45s -> 2236.74s]  All right, cool. Okay. There's one more up here. Yeah, there we go. All right. I really need to
[2236.74s -> 2252.20s]  find other health. I think there's one right here. I have to. I don't want to, but I'm going to.
[2253.56s -> 2278.66s]  Nothing personal. I just scared the shit out of somebody. All right. Did I miss anything up here?
[2289.98s -> 2303.66s]  How do you look like that? You look like you hate Sonic. I think I need to be a little fatter for
[2303.66s -> 2319.22s]  that one. Oh, but hold on. Do I be Dr. Robotnik for Halloween or do I stay with Count Dracula?
[2320.02s -> 2336.12s]  That's very hard now that you said that. I don't know. Do both. I don't think I can do both.
[2336.76s -> 2341.45s]  Cutscene.
[2364.31s -> 2373.10s]  You look old and pale in the new angle. I am old and pale. Sorry to ruin the surprise for you.
[2396.06s -> 2396.78s]  Separate ways.
[2424.36s -> 2428.04s]  Chapter two already? That was a whole chapter.
[2430.38s -> 2440.04s]  Okay, so what is that? Let me go. I got a scope, didn't I? What is this? That's a knife.
[2440.36s -> 2459.46s]  Uh, sorry about that. Okay. There we go. He's in an executive chair. Right. I don't know why an
[2459.46s -> 2464.02s]  executive is cracking his neck as in like, yeah, bring it on. I don't know what that was for.
[2464.66s -> 2477.85s]  All right. Let's, uh, anything else on the map is that, which is cool. Okay. I might brown out
[2477.85s -> 2482.79s]  my computer. I just want to make sure everyone's aware. Hey, I got a lot of testing to do if it
[2482.79s -> 2489.22s]  happens, but, uh, I, it could happen. It might happen right now. Uh, just to, uh, if I, if it
[2489.22s -> 2498.01s]  happens right now, then I will know exactly what's going on. So, uh, everyone say prayers.
[2498.57s -> 2525.27s]  I'm going to go down. Can I jump down? No, not yet. He saw me.
[2559.19s -> 2570.41s]  I got him. Well, this is going to be a chainsaw person down there. It's gonna be a chainsaw,
[2570.41s -> 2587.05s]  dude. I bet you there's a chainsaw person down there. Only handgun for a while. You look like
[2587.05s -> 2592.78s]  you own this castle. Uh, I, I want to write that one's going down in the notebook.
[2611.85s -> 2620.84s]  All right. Old man sounds. I probably shouldn't blow that up. I thought I was going to stand up
[2620.84s -> 2645.53s]  into it. Uh, how shitty is this set up? I have a lot of bullets. I think I got everything. Yeah.
[2662.44s -> 2665.56s]  I feel like I'm at an open mic night where one dude won't get off the stage. You go to open
[2665.56s -> 2670.78s]  mic night and the guy has an entire streaming set up on the stage and he's just playing
[2670.78s -> 2677.29s]  resident evil four to the audience. That actually is kind of funny. I, if somebody does that, I want
[2677.29s -> 2683.78s]  a 5% credit for it. Somebody should go like do a comedy night, right? Well, you have to get,
[2683.78s -> 2689.61s]  make sure you get permission first and be like, yeah, it's my routine. It's me. Uh, bill. Uh,
[2689.61s -> 2696.68s]  I am, uh, bill comedy. And Hey, let me talk about airplanes for a second and then stop talking and
[2696.68s -> 2700.28s]  just bring out an entire streaming set up and just played resident evil with a monitor facing
[2700.28s -> 2708.57s]  the audience. Looking back every so often, like, Whoa, did you see that? You're going to get booed
[2708.57s -> 2734.20s]  off stage as you deserve. Okay. Well, I got it. Don't reload at a time like this. You missed your
[2734.20s -> 2768.65s]  opportunity out of all the times to reload. Why that time? Jesus. Did I get hit by that? Oh my
[2768.65s -> 2775.75s]  God. I forgot about those. If they have the heads like this, that means they're like 10 times
[2775.75s -> 2799.27s]  stronger. Okay. Well I fucked that whole thing up by like running and like, I'm not that far. I'm
[2799.27s -> 2819.64s]  right here. You look like somebody that calls himself a man of culture. Yeah. I have to have
[2819.64s -> 2828.06s]  a craft beer here. I actually thought about it. I thought I was going to have a craft beer and just,
[2828.06s -> 2836.31s]  I was going to take a sip out of it every hour. Oh my God. Play the game. How did that hit me?
[2836.31s -> 2853.14s]  I'm looking down. Oh shit. My hand, my hand is a little sweaty. Hold on. My hand is sweaty.
[2854.02s -> 2881.24s]  Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. He's dead. All right. I should be fine now.
[2881.80s -> 2906.82s]  I don't want to take this shit right now. I have to, that stinks. How do I do the grapple hook
[2906.82s -> 2957.37s]  thing again? It's shipped, right? How do you do the grapple hook mailer? Yellow. All right. That
[2957.37s -> 2976.78s]  went a little better. A little. Can we just get one katana pick? Like I have, like I own a katana.
[2976.78s -> 2991.59s]  You want a katana? I don't, I don't, I don't own a katana. Do all goofy men in their late thirties
[2991.59s -> 3015.02s]  own katanas? Am I behind on this? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they do. All right. Where am I going?
[3033.16s -> 3055.51s]  I think I got everything. I got most, wait, what's that over there? You do the grapple,
[3055.51s -> 3071.16s]  you just need to hit the melee key from far away. Interesting. Put a fedora,
[3071.16s -> 3084.34s]  put a fedora on right now. I'm seeing quite the crowd here. I wonder what has them so riled up.
[3084.90s -> 3097.51s]  President's daughter. Couldn't have picked a worse time. Consider the village infected
[3097.51s -> 3105.90s]  saturation. I've read the file. I'll see what I can do. Turn on hand cam. Uh, I don't have one of
[3105.90s -> 3137.40s]  those. I'm not missing anything right now. Don't the treasure show up on the map? Oh,
[3137.48s -> 3156.78s]  wait, you guys gas lit the hell out of me last time I played this. That's not accurate. Uh,
[3156.78s -> 3166.76s]  let me sort this. I can craft right now. All right. What, what should I do? Should I just
[3166.76s -> 3173.34s]  get submachine gun ammo? I'll toss the monitor. Well, it's not going to be like this in the very
[3173.34s -> 3179.93s]  near future. I actually don't mind this angle though. I think it looks pretty fine, but this,
[3179.93s -> 3185.16s]  this wall back here, it's going to be a little bit, uh, I'll be a little bit closer. No,
[3185.16s -> 3187.64s]  it depends on how I do it, but I'll probably be closer to the wall.
[3188.46s -> 3218.36s]  And then this will be a little bit further away. I like the new setup. Well, it just,
[3218.36s -> 3226.28s]  it allows me to sit back. It's much more comfortable. I, I'll be really honest. Last,
[3226.28s -> 3232.92s]  I don't want to say the last couple of years, sitting up at a desk has just been, it's just,
[3232.92s -> 3238.81s]  it's just caused me so many issues. I don't want to get into it. I know it's a broken record at
[3238.81s -> 3244.57s]  this point talking about it, but being able to actually sit back changes everything for me.
[3245.29s -> 3262.98s]  I might be able to stealth kill like all these people. Yeah. I thought of, you know,
[3262.98s -> 3266.18s]  get a standing desk, but standing is not, doesn't, it's not great either.
[3268.57s -> 3273.99s]  This position I'm in right now is just the perfect position for me to do anything. Seated,
[3274.87s -> 3280.31s]  not really slouched, but have the support of my back at the upper chest area. Something about
[3280.31s -> 3290.47s]  sitting in a chair like this. Much better. I'm much happier. Not that I was miserable before,
[3290.47s -> 3305.19s]  but you all know, I don't have to get into it. I want to go upstairs. Wait, no, no, no. Check
[3305.19s -> 3337.82s]  every corner. I feel like there's probably something down there, but hold on. No, I was
[3337.82s -> 3341.98s]  already up there. All right, let's go. I always feel like I'm going to miss something in these
[3341.98s -> 3352.33s]  games and I always do. I'm going to get surrounded, right? That's how it works.
[3358.20s -> 3391.99s]  See you. Is that person still alive? Get off me. We're good. We're not good.
[3392.55s -> 3409.77s]  Stop exploding old people. You tried Baldur's Gate 3? Yeah, Holly and I actually played it for
[3409.77s -> 3415.45s]  a little bit, but I got a little distracted with other stuff, but I do want to get back into it.
[3416.33s -> 3431.38s]  We did the first maybe five to 10 hours. Nothing, anything past that. Can't I, hold on a second.
[3434.74s -> 3450.17s]  I need the two ovals, not, or rectangles, not the ovals. Try Voices of the Void. That game
[3450.17s -> 3465.30s]  is perfect for you. I'll try it. She has her trust over there. Oh my God. He said, he said it
[3465.30s -> 3485.91s]  funny. I did. I did say it funny. You're too self-aware. I have to be. I, sometimes I can't
[3485.91s -> 3508.79s]  even put up with my own bullshit. It's, you know what I mean? I have to be. Nice. Okay.
[3509.94s -> 3520.34s]  What's the goal here? Just to go down here. Okay. You forgot to clean the chocolate milk mustache
[3520.34s -> 3527.05s]  off. I can't, my, my, anytime I try to do something like this, it's just disgusting,
[3534.98s -> 3556.70s]  but I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. How much did this VTuber avatar cost?
[3568.22s -> 3616.47s]  What the fuck? He knows how to speak Resident Evil. Okay. Am I missing something? Nope.
[3627.40s -> 3642.34s]  Not surprised. So kind of you to keep our friends busy.
[3643.30s -> 3661.59s]  He's such a dickhead. This way looks promising. I'm not even looking. I'm not even looking. I
[3661.59s -> 3685.91s]  missed. Shit. I love this engine. It's, you know, I know, I know I'm the fuck Capcom guy.
[3686.71s -> 3693.70s]  I know that, but I think they actually might be, as of right now, probably one of the better
[3693.70s -> 3698.09s]  game company that exists right now. I think they've had, they've had like five bangers in a
[3698.09s -> 3702.33s]  row. And I can't, like, I can't deny that. It's like, I think that they've been doing,
[3702.33s -> 3718.09s]  they're doing a wonderful job, a wonderful job, but that was just, that was just anger coming out.
[3718.09s -> 3723.94s]  I didn't actually mean that I was mad because I couldn't change the FOV and I got very upset
[3723.94s -> 3745.34s]  about it. Like irrationally upset. There was no reason to be that mad about it. This is going to
[3745.34s -> 3794.39s]  fall. I think that's what happens when you play on standard mode. Oh, just in time, bros. Top
[3794.39s -> 3809.83s]  shit at the bottom. They both have little, uh, circles on them. Okay. I have to use the mouse
[3809.83s -> 3823.46s]  scroll. That's it, right? Now that I think, all right. Where's the other one? The two birds.
[3823.46s -> 3846.60s]  Is it that one? It's like the opposite to kind of either this one or this one. I'm pretty sure
[3846.60s -> 3861.64s]  it's that one. All right. Well we need the third one. I can't do it without the third one. Where's
[3861.64s -> 3884.15s]  this painted down there? Oh, he's going to get up. He's going to get up. He's going to get up.
[3884.15s -> 3903.38s]  He's going to get up. He figured it out. Wait, what's this? Oh, it's one of those. Get all the
[3903.38s -> 3910.07s]  blue things. Six spinals. All right. So are they listed? They are. So this one's right behind me.
[3910.07s -> 3937.14s]  Or is it? Oh, there it is. I see it. Did I see it? I think I did. Where are the other ones? Okay.
[3937.78s -> 3954.22s]  Uh, what is it? It is. It's the, I need to get this guy out of the way. How do I move this guy?
[3954.22s -> 3963.70s]  I think it's the two. How do I move this guy? I think I know which one it is. It's the double.
[3967.85s -> 3982.14s]  It's the two, one, two, and then I'll figure it out. Skip VOD watchers. Skip. No VOD watchers.
[3982.14s -> 3987.29s]  Stay here. Don't leave. Unless you've got something to do. You might have an appointment.
[3987.29s -> 3990.33s]  You have like other stuff going on. Maybe your friend's coming over. Maybe like school you got
[3990.33s -> 3995.29s]  to go to. Maybe you've got, um, like food to eat or something. Don't go. Unless any of those things
[3995.29s -> 3998.41s]  are happening. Maybe you'd like playing a game on your own. Maybe you don't feel like watching
[3998.41s -> 4010.25s]  TV or streaming today. That's fine. But any other scenario, don't go. Which one is it?
[4010.81s -> 4034.01s]  Is it this one? No. It's like a double bump. Is it this right here? Was it that? It had like two
[4034.89s -> 4049.30s]  bumps. Fucking one of these. One, two, but I, the guy is in the way. It's not my fault.
[4050.18s -> 4073.70s]  Does he despawn? Get the fuck out of, I don't care. It's worth it. What is on the right here?
[4073.70s -> 4088.04s]  That's what I need. Is it? Okay. One, two, wait. Okay. One, two, three. He's only covering 5%
[4088.04s -> 4094.26s]  of the design. Yeah, but it's important to know it. I think it's the one, it's one, two, three.
[4094.26s -> 4098.98s]  There's a third one right there. He's just in the way. It's one, two, three. It's three of those,
[4098.98s -> 4123.72s]  uh, squiggly swirlies, whatever they are. Right? I'm pretty sure this is it. There's only like two
[4123.72s -> 4127.86s]  options. Well, I want to do the puzzle. I don't want to just, I didn't want it to be handed to
[4127.86s -> 4136.65s]  me by a chat member saying that one third one from the left. That's not me. I don't think I
[4136.65s -> 4151.34s]  need to deal yet. Blue medallions. I'd want it to run that way. I didn't the church. I literally
[4151.34s -> 4167.22s]  turned around. I literally turned around. Oh God damn it, man. Well, can I go back? I doubt it.
[4167.22s -> 4199.32s]  Some shit over here though. I might actually have to restart. Hey, Red Dead Redemption figured this
[4199.32s -> 4208.44s]  out a long time ago. Old shift for two seconds to grab a hook. Tap shift is in a tap shift.
[4208.52s -> 4212.20s]  That doesn't work. Hold shift is run. Whatever. I don't know how to figure this shit. I don't know
[4212.20s -> 4232.42s]  how to fix this. I really want those that wins. Where's the auto save right now? Well, it looks
[4232.42s -> 4289.21s]  like we're not getting those spinals 10 seconds ago. Hey, that kind of whatever. It's okay. Hey,
[4289.21s -> 4305.54s]  we don't even need them. I don't want to miss the shit here though. I'm upset about that. I'm upset.
[4306.02s -> 4327.03s]  What do I do about this? Restart the whole DLC? No, I'm sorry. People are so mean to you.
[4327.67s -> 4359.51s]  They don't, they don't mean it. Sorry. I do. Well, you know what? Give a shit. I give a fuck.
[4359.51s -> 4411.99s]  Let's fuck up. Cut scene. Minus one. I know the vision, but the sounds weren't set. We're sad.
[4412.55s -> 4421.13s]  I like how I got a half point on that. Well, no, actually it's a half negative point. Hey,
[4421.13s -> 4433.16s]  I know the vision was there. The vision was there. I feel like I just auditioned for American
[4433.16s -> 4439.14s]  Idol and I was not very good, but you didn't want to tell me I wasn't good because you didn't want
[4439.14s -> 4467.26s]  me to like scream at you. Hey, what's that line? Where's everybody going? Bingo. Wait,
[4467.26s -> 4476.63s]  why is he dressed like this? Why is he dressed like that? Why is he dressed like that? That
[4476.63s -> 4484.62s]  didn't happen in my game. First time's free. Why does he look like that? Don't keep me waiting,
[4484.62s -> 4492.22s]  Luis. I didn't even know that was Leon. We're supposed to know that that's like a,
[4492.22s -> 4496.22s]  wow, this is that part that everybody thinks is funny and cool. I thought that was a different
[4496.22s -> 4515.85s]  character. Sir Mendez, isn't it? He has a house there. Could be worth taking a look.
[4515.85s -> 4527.11s]  Do it. I'll see what I can do it. Sorry. I just hear that and I just have to do trouble.
[4527.19s -> 4536.46s]  No stream while sitting on a camel next time, bro. Some of you guys need to fucking relax.
[4543.08s -> 4571.02s]  Okay. This thing is fucking filthy. Where do I go? So where, uh,
[4574.09s -> 4595.50s]  where do I go? It's locked. It's not locked. What if Ashley,
[4595.50s -> 4613.13s]  they're locked in the church to leave point good time. Trevor from GTA. Any other stuff in here?
[4618.50s -> 4630.26s]  He does. He does. That one was real. Uh, was it, is this a treasure map?
[4630.26s -> 4684.73s]  Somebody write that down real quick. Bird. What's up? Wait, can I break through? I can
[4684.73s -> 4700.02s]  definitely get through that glass. Yeah. Be kidding me. I can't shoot up there. Why not?
[4700.02s -> 4722.60s]  His bar is there. Well, did I miss something in that door or around the side? I would imagine
[4722.60s -> 4733.43s]  I could have grappled hooked up to the top there, but I guess not. Once we go back, wait,
[4737.46s -> 4750.25s]  can't get up there. Why don't we do that? I've asked this question before and I've
[4750.25s -> 4754.81s]  never gotten an answer. How come anytime you ever looked down or anytime you rub your eye,
[4754.81s -> 4770.18s]  everybody goes, what is the reflex in your brain that does that? Damn it. Oh, I was going to get
[4770.18s -> 4800.28s]  a lot of people to think I was cool. Glasses. Somebody has a bomb view. I'm trying to do the
[4800.28s -> 4807.94s]  melee when they're far away, but it's not, um, it's not doing it. Do I have to be really far
[4807.94s -> 4836.86s]  away? Somebody has a grenade. I can hear it. All right. So I need to go that way. Is it,
[4836.86s -> 4849.99s]  is the thing in one of the gravestones? It probably is, right? It's definitely, it's like
[4849.99s -> 4895.94s]  in or on the back yet over here somewhere. The worst place to put that. Okay. I don't see it
[4895.94s -> 4918.01s]  over here. I just have to backtrack this whole way. I do. I did. Thank you. Stranger. So what
[4918.01s -> 4928.18s]  are you buying? You've picked quite the place to set up shop stranger. I, and look what it brought.
[4928.18s -> 4949.45s]  That scared the shit out of me. Let's make our first time doing business. All right. I got money
[4949.53s -> 4956.49s]  and I, I do have that case customized shit. Don't I? I don't have any, um, key chains for it though.
[4957.21s -> 4972.42s]  Got something new for you. I trade it. Wait, let me, let me load these up first.
[4978.46s -> 4990.81s]  Blue. Uh, I could do one in one. That'd be good. Or should I wait? Is two better? Should I do two
[4990.81s -> 5001.06s]  red? I kind of don't, I don't want to lose all of them though. Two is better. Double is more.
[5001.70s -> 5019.86s]  How much more? 12,000. Yeah, let's do it. Oh, this is just for selling.
[5021.22s -> 5037.29s]  Well, killing me. Oh wait. Trade. Oh, you can trade for a spinals. Okay. That's interesting.
[5037.29s -> 5044.78s]  Got a itchy neck. Ruby's all rubbish. She makes no difference. The price. Well,
[5045.50s -> 5049.50s]  that's our choice. I don't need these glasses. Like Wesker doesn't get pissed off or something
[5049.50s -> 5054.01s]  like those are my glasses. You found them. Why did you not give them back to me? I don't think so.
[5057.62s -> 5066.02s]  Thank you. Anything else I can help you with? All right. Important. You'll get some bang for
[5066.02s -> 5080.84s]  your buck. I guarantee it. Sawed off. W870. First aid spray. I want the case upgraded.
[5081.48s -> 5089.96s]  All yours stranger. Plus 15% submachine gun ammo craft bonus frequency. I mean, why not, right?
[5094.10s -> 5106.09s]  Stranger. Should I get this or am I going to find a better submachine gun in like 20 minutes?
[5110.46s -> 5124.28s]  Get it? Stranger. I'm going to get a first aid spray because I suck at video games and I need
[5124.28s -> 5130.47s]  to make sure I have it in case I need it. You know, I'll just buy these. I don't always have
[5130.47s -> 5141.82s]  this in stock. Stranger. Punisher. That's, is that accuracy or is that, no, is that firepower
[5141.82s -> 5152.09s]  accuracy? Precision. Why not try your hand at a new gun stranger? I'm going to keep it. All right.
[5152.09s -> 5159.30s]  Tune up. Power. I think we're going to go power. Molding a weapon. We're starting to get an idea
[5159.30s -> 5164.17s]  of your tastes friend. I never used the submachine gun. I might as well this time.
[5164.97s -> 5179.45s]  Prepare the knife. Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave. I feel like I'm not going
[5179.45s -> 5184.31s]  to use this that frequently. I'd rather just not have this. It takes a lot of space.
[5193.32s -> 5207.78s]  What do I have here? Hold on. I need to make some stuff. Okay. I could make a ton of submachine
[5207.78s -> 5221.13s]  gun ammo. I can make rifle ammo too. Or handgun ammo. Yeah. Let's go submachine gun. Ooh, nice.
[5221.13s -> 5239.18s]  Okay. I'm going to hold off now. A lot of ammo. I got two heals. I'll be fine. You hate the
[5239.18s -> 5245.10s]  shotgun? Well, I mean, the last time I played this, I did 50 round shotgun and just unloaded
[5245.10s -> 5250.52s]  on the last boss and beat the game in 10 seconds. I didn't even have this equipped. Oh my God. I'm
[5250.52s -> 5266.63s]  such a dope. I don't know why I thought it was on automatically for some reason. Okay. Let's go.
[5267.35s -> 5278.12s]  So far, this is fun. I like it. Just more of a residue before. All right. This thing is ready
[5278.12s -> 5293.24s]  to go. So what's next? Into the village square. Should I make the rifle ammo and just have it?
[5293.24s -> 5309.51s]  I feel like maybe I will need it. I'll think about it. Let's go. I don't have enough money
[5309.51s -> 5318.57s]  to repair the knife, so we aren't going to do that. Get some thoughts. Unusual. Yeah. Yeah.
[5319.21s -> 5338.12s]  I said beast. Uh-huh. That thing is coming. Okay. Master, I beg you. All right. Okay. Boom. Oh,
[5338.12s -> 5342.20s]  I got to start doing 1080p streaming as well. I'm thinking about how I'm going to do that.
[5343.48s -> 5348.44s]  Maybe I just won't. 864p all the way. All right. I thought that was Darth Vader when I came over
[5348.44s -> 5364.44s]  here. Like right now, that was Darth Vader. Saddler, the leader of the cult. Make the switch
[5364.44s -> 5375.48s]  right now. We'll see. If anything, I probably would. What's the bitrate I stream at right now?
[5376.04s -> 5380.79s]  I'm pretty sure I'm at the maximum allowed bitrate for Twitch, but I'm going to look into
[5380.79s -> 5385.11s]  that again because I might be able to increase it by like 500 to a thousand, which might just
[5385.11s -> 5400.42s]  fix everything. Not that the stream looks terrible, but eh. Let's see. Make the rifle ammo.
[5400.42s -> 5433.40s]  I don't have one of these burritos. All right. This is definitely the actual fight.
[5440.73s -> 5449.69s]  Okay. What do we got? Parry. You have a knife? Oh, that's why they were saying you should repair
[5449.69s -> 5455.29s]  the knife. Jerma. Jerma, can you hear us? Jerma, please. You need to repair the knife. Oh, I see
[5455.29s -> 5476.20s]  now. I think I just did it though. You tell me to parry and then you tell me to press C on the
[5476.20s -> 5527.29s]  keyboard. Come on, Gwen. Where are you? Oh, shit. Tried to parry it. Does that mean it's locked?
[5529.96s -> 5572.58s]  Yes. God damn it. Not again. Oh, I got it. This is the real one. Oh, shit. No. I don't need to do
[5572.58s -> 5675.98s]  that yet. He's fake. It's getting thicker. You idiot. Mog-like. Kind of. Chief's house.
[5675.98s -> 5693.24s]  Thought I'd left that life behind. Are you reclined? My legs are not up. Hey, in the future,
[5693.24s -> 5702.01s]  might be an opportunity where I would be in. Legs might be up. All right. Let me just make sure I
[5702.01s -> 5720.12s]  get everything here. Let me replace all the stuff I just shot. Sausages? Corn. There are sausages
[5720.12s -> 5772.60s]  right behind it, guys. Glass. Anything else? Yes. Okay, so that was this house. You know,
[5772.60s -> 5778.54s]  I'm checking every single one of these, right? And we shouldn't. Every single one of these.
[5786.23s -> 5849.24s]  Shotgun. Boogers. Oh, Leon took it. Continuity. That it? Maybe. It's a quick rocking break.
[5849.24s -> 5865.37s]  What is the green smudge behind you? It's making me want to. Hey, will you settle down?
[5865.37s -> 5887.72s]  It's the whole Pac-Man crew. Settle down. Keep them. Oh, trust me. I will keep them.
[5887.72s -> 5892.54s]  I just want to put them there because it was fun. And I have a streamer room now.
[5892.54s -> 5897.64s]  All right. I could have. That's this one. There's one more. Two more houses I want to look at.
[5906.58s -> 5933.62s]  Anything else? I don't think so. Oh, egg. Nice. There is an Omega chest in here.
[5933.62s -> 5962.10s]  Oh, that's this one. This one. There's one. What? Two more houses? One, two. And over here.
[5962.66s -> 5980.25s]  That's it. Did I get the item I was supposed to get? No. Yeah, I don't think I did. I have to go
[5987.00s -> 6015.99s]  village chiefs. Now, did I get that item? I didn't. So what do I get that? Yeah, maybe up there.
[6015.99s -> 6035.93s]  Oh, no, it's broken. Oh, shit. I can go in here. Wait. Don't think I'm stupid. Don't think I'm
[6035.93s -> 6042.47s]  stupid. Don't think I don't think I'm stupid. Please don't think I'm stupid. I have a reason
[6042.47s -> 6058.46s]  for it. OK, but in actuality, though, I don't have the thing to put into the church thing.
[6058.46s -> 6094.06s]  It's some aviators. I just go all the way back. I didn't really accomplish much besides.
[6094.06s -> 6102.07s]  Yeah, sure. No, I know. I mean, I need that circular thing. I thought I was going to get
[6102.07s -> 6111.96s]  it from that little boss fight, but I didn't get it. Are you pretending? No. Every time there's a
[6111.96s -> 6117.66s]  cut scene, I go like this and just just watch what you guys say for five minutes. And then I turn back
[6117.66s -> 6124.79s]  when the cut scenes over and then the cut scene ends. And she has said the next step of the video
[6124.79s -> 6132.23s]  game. And I've been just like hanging out over here. It's like just like just chatting. You
[6132.39s -> 6141.35s]  you guys are the cut scene for me. That's so funny to think about. Not every time,
[6141.35s -> 6147.03s]  but a lot of time. It kind of works out that way. Name every bug. Beetle. Spider. Arachnid.
[6151.29s -> 6205.77s]  Selpigid. Scorpion. Wasp. Bee. Weevil. Death feigning beetle. Ant. Butterfly. Earwig.
[6206.33s -> 6215.98s]  Okay. Who cares? Oh, is it a cut scene? No, I'm paying attention now.
[6215.98s -> 6263.78s]  Has accepted the gift. The straw's not long enough. That's what she was during that cut scene.
[6263.78s -> 6297.02s]  Ada saves him. Ada saves him. It's pretty cool. That's my favorite chapter, I think.
[6300.87s -> 6305.51s]  Anybody else do that? I hate that I do it, but I do it. It's so obvious, but you do it anyways.
[6306.23s -> 6310.42s]  Something's on TV or a movie or a show or a game. Doesn't matter what it is.
[6311.14s -> 6315.82s]  And you know what characters on screen and you fall asleep for like five straight minutes.
[6317.82s -> 6320.62s]  And when you know that everyone else is awake and you're not,
[6321.35s -> 6324.39s]  you kind of wake up and just say the character's name. And then the thing that they were just
[6324.39s -> 6329.67s]  doing, like, oh yeah, I was watching like Ada on the roof. Yep. Ada up on the roof.
[6332.70s -> 6338.15s]  That was good. That was good. It was a good chapter. Pretty cool. What's, yeah,
[6338.15s -> 6341.91s]  that's like probably like the best part of the game, I think. And you were sleeping for five,
[6341.91s -> 6348.04s]  10 straight minutes. It's like, everybody knows you have no idea what just happened.
[6348.68s -> 6352.68s]  And it sucks so bad when that person is then like, yeah, dude. Oh,
[6352.68s -> 6357.32s]  the part right before that too. Like, remember that? It's like, oh shit. I'm getting quizzed.
[6358.28s -> 6368.79s]  Yeah. Oh, and then you make up shit that you started a new conversation. You say like,
[6369.35s -> 6374.23s]  oh yeah. Hey, did you upgrade? Did you upgrade that gun? Did you, that when you upgraded that
[6374.23s -> 6378.71s]  gun, are you going to continue to upgrade the machine gun? Then you get them talking
[6378.71s -> 6381.91s]  and make sure that they continue to kind of lead the conversation to a new area.
[6389.35s -> 6407.16s]  What a first world problem. I'll say that's social poker. No, that's, I don't want the
[6407.16s -> 6414.95s]  person to think that I don't care or I'm not paying attention or I'd be like, keep them busy.
[6419.24s -> 6428.44s]  That outfit, that outfit is so funny. I wasn't sleeping. You, you pick things that, you know,
[6428.44s -> 6449.29s]  you can ask an answer to. My sleepy dad does that a lot. I don't have a key. Okay. I need a key.
[6449.85s -> 6464.65s]  It's 3am in Europe. Why are you always alive at the worst times? Well, here's you and here am I.
[6467.02s -> 6478.81s]  There's 7 million miles between us. Sorry. Sorry. I'm really sorry. It's just the way it is.
[6487.56s -> 6492.49s]  You said I have jowls? Who just said I had jowls? Ban that person for real. Like,
[6492.49s -> 6503.06s]  don't let them ever come back. No, I don't. Whatever. Did anybody actually say that? I
[6503.06s -> 6526.52s]  actually need to know. What did they actually say? And at least their holy book looks interesting.
[6526.52s -> 6539.91s]  Jowls detected. Reload all these guns. None of us are thinking about your jowls.
[6539.91s -> 6560.02s]  They got permabanned. Let that be a lesson. Oh, you little shits. This could use some cleaning.
[6560.02s -> 6584.87s]  I can't leave empty handed. Oh, grandpa's coming out. Ooh, an extravagant clock.
[6585.43s -> 6592.49s]  Oh no, the recliner era. Yeah. I was going to have a cigar over here and have like a little,
[6592.49s -> 6597.13s]  like a lighter, just like take a break and be like, I'll be right back. Put it in and like,
[6598.18s -> 6602.60s]  just walk off camera. Maybe I still will. Just pretend you didn't see it. Pretend we didn't
[6602.60s -> 6625.14s]  talk about it. Okay. So cool. Very cool. Wait, check every single corner. Yeah, that's why.
[6626.10s -> 6644.30s]  What have we here? Wait, there was a, there was a bureau that a key could go into.
[6645.93s -> 6667.14s]  Back here. There was a key. There was a keyhole. Look at that. I think if I put that key
[6667.94s -> 6708.18s]  into the keyhole, I might be, where is that room? Is he cooking? Fellas. Fellas. There's a keyhole.
[6708.18s -> 6724.04s]  Holy. Okay. Whoa. This is probably important. Brothers and sisters. Our Lord is displeased.
[6724.36s -> 6729.70s]  Do not recklessly slay outsiders at will. All people have a right to fair. Has anybody else
[6729.70s -> 6736.74s]  found this? Henceforth, we shall deliver solemn justice without prejudice. Take any
[6736.74s -> 6746.22s]  when you capture the factory basement. Do the same with the traders. I bet they took him.
[6746.22s -> 6752.07s]  I think you might be the first. I feel like, I mean, that's, who would be able to put that
[6752.07s -> 6759.62s]  together? It's like kind of hard. Most people just would give up, I think. Okay. So now I got
[6759.62s -> 6780.36s]  to go down here. Sounds good. Let's go. Can I like run out now? Chest? No. Is this a fight?
[6786.89s -> 6809.43s]  Whoa. I, what happened to him? No. What? There's, there's going to be jewels and stuff back there.
[6809.43s -> 6818.41s]  I can't, whatever. You cannot be serious. There's no way you got a hold of me. That was just,
[6818.41s -> 6860.90s]  this lady was magnetized to my body. Can you, I wonder if you can kill him. No, you can't. Leon
[6860.90s -> 6867.13s]  kills him in like four hours from now. What am I talking about? Is there stuff in here? Who cares?
[6868.57s -> 6899.00s]  Ah! Grapple. Grapple it. Grapple. Just kill me. Kill me. That, no, this doesn't count.
[6909.77s -> 6918.14s]  I wouldn't have taken that much damage. Just let me restart. Everybody just settle down.
[6918.14s -> 6922.94s]  I bet they took him here. He's playing on standard. He's unbelievable. Ah, shut up.
[6927.34s -> 6949.03s]  Shut up. Grandpa skill issue. Yeah. All right. I'm not, I turn around and run. All of these escape
[6949.83s -> 6954.23s]  the guy. I always just take it so not seriously. And it's, you have to take it dead seriously.
[6970.95s -> 6985.37s]  She does not sound concerned at all. Looks like I gave them the slip.
[6986.01s -> 6997.67s]  He's too cool for this. Yeah. Have some new goods that might interest you.
[6997.67s -> 7003.14s]  If you turned around and started Fortnite dancing to that guy, do you think he would stop?
[7003.14s -> 7017.77s]  Do you think he'd be like, Oh, or if you like held your hand out, like, I think he'd be like,
[7017.77s -> 7020.73s]  Oh, wait a minute. What does that mean? What does that mean? Why are you doing that?
[7021.29s -> 7035.18s]  I feel like you would actually stop. Did I get, I haven't gotten any of these.
[7040.18s -> 7050.25s]  Minus two. Don't let them get to you. It's all right.
[7057.61s -> 7081.21s]  I can put a blue in here. 10,000. I haven't found any of these. I've just not been looking
[7081.29s -> 7095.56s]  or have I not found any? I can sell this, right? Yeah. That means I can sell it. I forget.
[7096.71s -> 7105.96s]  Don't play this game. I don't like it. I like it.
[7106.68s -> 7133.72s]  8% running speed. That's like, that's hacking a hundred thousand dollars. Okay. Nevermind.
[7133.72s -> 7135.96s]  Give that the care it deserves, mate.
[7138.42s -> 7146.52s]  And probably ammo capacity. Try that on for size. I've been using the knife a lot.
[7153.59s -> 7180.89s]  What can I do you for? Okay. That's a bird. Okay. Now I need to, some grubby thief has stolen
[7180.89s -> 7185.61s]  a jacket. One of those nice sheepskin leather ones. I think you can get it back. I think I saw
[7185.61s -> 7199.19s]  this. No, I didn't. It's inside here. Does this massage your back? No, that'd be really funny
[7199.19s -> 7225.40s]  if it did though. Let me do a little bit of moving around here. Okay. So I have these. Yes.
[7226.55s -> 7241.51s]  Nice. You need a sharper image chair. I have not heard that in a long time. I'm going to eat the
[7241.51s -> 7256.31s]  egg. All right, let's go. Why is the chair blurry? Like a felt material, like a upholstered.
[7261.74s -> 7268.73s]  Interactive retinal inquiry system. The iris will allow you to see clues that are almost
[7268.73s -> 7284.94s]  invisible. We get a Batman mode. Okay. How do I do that? Must be the big guys. Iris activated.
[7285.50s -> 7312.47s]  Okay. So that way, but what is over here? Can I turn that? No. This new different music is
[7312.47s -> 7358.09s]  playing right now. What? Wait. Oh no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. I'm fine. I'm fine. We're fine.
[7358.09s -> 7373.64s]  Eat the egg. That didn't count. That was annoying. Must be the big guys. Let's go.
[7401.21s -> 7450.98s]  That's some, uh, that's some TF2 backstab shit right there. Right. Just bite me. Oh,
[7450.98s -> 7467.13s]  I got the jacket. Nice. Okay. I should go too. I'm going to go turn it in right now.
[7467.13s -> 7481.19s]  It's spinals, right? Crossbow last crossbow. Oh goodness. All right. I got to, I don't think I'm
[7481.19s -> 7490.07s]  going to keep that. That's kind of got to go. Yeah, that I don't, I don't think I'm going to
[7490.07s -> 7510.71s]  use it. Let me just go back and get this, uh, turning what you're buying. Oh, I have to sell
[7510.71s -> 7534.71s]  it. Right. Seven spinals. Okay. So killing me years haven't been kind to us for operative
[7534.71s -> 7543.61s]  resources, for operative large resources. What is the, what's the one I need to use?
[7544.73s -> 7558.74s]  Okay. So that's the, the larger, small at the maps dude. Yeah, that's a good idea.
[7560.46s -> 7570.58s]  Uh, it's large, right? Yeah. Good instincts. I might just get one of these too.
[7573.24s -> 7580.60s]  What's worth more purple or probably purple. I can turn this in now. You choose that one.
[7583.40s -> 7600.41s]  Okay. Welcome. What can I interest you in? I can upgrade some more stuff. Very nice.
[7600.73s -> 7611.78s]  A deal. Well struck. There you are. This thing is now disgusting. All right. I think I'm just
[7611.78s -> 7616.18s]  going to sell this thing. I don't think I'm going to use it. I not using really it, you know,
[7619.61s -> 7624.39s]  I don't think so. How much is it worth? Do you much good in the gray? Five grand. That's it.
[7624.95s -> 7638.44s]  You don't have to keep justifying it. I know that. Right. Hold on a minute. I always go,
[7638.44s -> 7644.10s]  you know, I, you know, you know, but the, the, the 40 people in this chat that are going to call
[7644.10s -> 7667.78s]  me names because I got rid of the crossbow. He's zipping up his crotch villain arc. I just, I won't
[7667.78s -> 7671.62s]  use it. You know me. I'll wait till the last cut scene and shoot it once and miss the guy's head
[7671.62s -> 7678.41s]  this way and then reload the save. I'm just going to get rid of the trouble. Decide in a deal.
[7678.89s -> 7687.59s]  Struck. Uh, where are the, I got to just get rid of the ammo for it too.
[7688.15s -> 7702.60s]  Oh boy. I can certainly do something with this. Give that the care it deserves.
[7703.64s -> 7715.93s]  Save my money. Got to select. Thank you. Do check out my wares again soon.
[7717.53s -> 7727.30s]  Oh, I have the new case. All right. More resources. This dude absolutely hates his viewers.
[7727.86s -> 7737.21s]  He hates us. Somebody said I'm soft locked. You're freaking me out. I know it's, I don't,
[7737.21s -> 7744.36s]  I don't think I am, but he hates us. How do I turn off the golden eye clock that's on the
[7744.36s -> 7767.70s]  screen right now? How do I get this off? Or is it just on? Oh, right. It needs to be on.
[7782.25s -> 7786.55s]  My legs are up in the air right now and I'm just swinging. May as well be at,
[7787.78s -> 7877.05s]  may as well be at the park. Now what? Treasure. Where is it? Bullets. Treasure in here. Oh,
[7877.05s -> 7891.06s]  it's a, are you in an AI generated chair? I'm going to, I'm going to lift my hand up to smoke
[7891.06s -> 7906.36s]  a cigarette and I'm going to have like 14 fingers. So I can't get that. Whatever.
[7927.59s -> 7947.40s]  These belong to Louise. That's a lot of money. Okay. So these, did Louise do this? Oh, I remember
[7947.40s -> 7960.79s]  this cut scene. Wait, is this where Louise was dancing? There's a lot of, nah, this is when he
[7960.79s -> 7991.08s]  was with Leon, right? Look at that. Okay. 4-2-2-1-6-2-5. Okay. Is this his frequency?
[7991.08s -> 8007.32s]  Nobody answers an unknown phone number. That's my job. Are you about ready to hand over the
[8007.32s -> 8014.65s]  amber? There's a big house just outside the village past the windmill. Yeah, I know it.
[8054.55s -> 8066.50s]  And where's the chainsaw?
[8078.60s -> 8178.65s]  Where is it? That was fucking scary. Is that loud? I'm sorry. All right. We're good.
[8193.46s -> 8200.42s]  Am I scared of the video game or did I put my hand on a fucking hot stove? What, what, what,
[8200.42s -> 8213.03s]  what happened? If I put my hand up right now, it's going to be bright red pulsing. Jesus. I need to
[8213.03s -> 8223.16s]  settle the fuck down. I don't have a key. And why am I using this rifle? I could have just shot him
[8223.16s -> 8259.35s]  one, one second with the gun that's actually upgraded. All right. You shot her a hundred
[8259.35s -> 8267.77s]  times in the ass. Oh my God. Is she still alive? I I'm not, I'm not dying there. I'm sorry. I'm not
[8267.77s -> 8292.86s]  dying there. I have to, I have to find it. Oopsie. Oh, somebody's saying, oh, so close. Oh, I'm not
[8292.86s -> 8299.56s]  going to hit every single bear trap on the ground. Okay. I'm going the absolute wrong way, but there's
[8299.56s -> 8307.32s]  money here. Where is it that? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Sorry. I'm turned around. I was
[8307.32s -> 8318.73s]  really scared. Where is this? Uh, there we go. Okay. Let's get out of here. Uh, I can't get this.
[8318.73s -> 8357.88s]  There is something here. He's shaking. I'm fine. Use some WD 40 on that chair. Oh yeah. It looked
[8357.88s -> 8383.56s]  like it did look like that. Oh no. Let's go. There's nothing in here. And I keep, I keep doing it.
[8383.56s -> 8394.47s]  I need to take a break so I can fill this back up. It is Wesker. To what do I owe this pleasure?
[8396.09s -> 8404.02s]  Stop wasting my time, Ada. Find Lewis, fetch me the Amber. I should probably thank you for this
[8404.02s -> 8413.38s]  room. Are you staying? Back me up. I'm not here to babysit you. See that you remain an asset.
[8413.38s -> 8420.62s]  I'm not a liability. I have absolutely no use for your incompetence. Easy with the threats,
[8420.62s -> 8433.77s]  Wesker. Just get it done. I'll be in touch. Wesker, Wesker, Wesker. Uh, where do you think he gets his
[8433.77s -> 8448.70s]  glasses? Yes. Just had some business to attend to. I'm on my way now. See you soon. Ciao. Hey,
[8448.70s -> 8457.26s]  there's a lot of treasure over there. All right. Let me, uh, take a quick break. I'm going to get
[8457.26s -> 8876.30s]  some, refill my, um, drink. I'll be right back. Give me one sec. Okay. I am kind of back. Just
[8876.30s -> 8890.78s]  need to move this back and we're good. Refilled the drink. Yeah, kind of. Well, I'm settling back
[8890.78s -> 8900.68s]  down doing some stretches, moving my legs around. You're going to stream on YouTube.
[8900.68s -> 8908.68s]  Uh, I don't know. I know I want to do some YouTube content again, but I'm kind of just
[8908.68s -> 8914.36s]  playing it by ear and just doing what I feel like on a day-to-day basis, at least in like the content
[8914.36s -> 8925.51s]  creation shit besides the off-brand stuff. Cause that is usually, usually spend at least a few
[8925.51s -> 8935.54s]  hours. I'd say at least a few hours a month thinking about what I want to do for this.
[8935.62s -> 8944.55s]  So I'm just saying words while I get this figured out. I promise I'm not high. I just,
[8944.55s -> 8961.37s]  this keyboard, there we go. You didn't deny hating us earlier. I, nah, but, uh, of like the,
[8961.37s -> 8965.53s]  the hours I spent off-brand a week trying to still figure out what the good timing to stream is. I
[8965.53s -> 8980.60s]  think I got a pretty good schedule here. I would say it. I'm glad you all, I'm glad you all get it.
[8980.60s -> 8991.42s]  I'm glad you all think it's humorous. Okay. Let's go back. Good. Make sure the camera's in a good
[8991.42s -> 9032.54s]  spot. Yeah. I was happening here. It wasn't tangled. Take a step. I looked in the mirror.
[9032.54s -> 9040.87s]  I keep thinking of that person that said I look like the guy that owns the castle. All right. Hi.
[9040.87s -> 9053.85s]  Okay. Are you ready? I'm ready. I want them back down. Actually. I love this little keyboard,
[9053.85s -> 9061.34s]  this thing before we get started and keep going that I can turn the volume up and down with this.
[9063.05s -> 9070.20s]  Okay. Um, take a look at this thing. It's one of these. It's one of those half keyboards,
[9071.99s -> 9079.08s]  not a full keyboard. It doesn't have the, uh, all the number pad on it. It's awesome. It's a steel
[9079.08s -> 9088.09s]  series apex three. The thing is awesome. Great to just kind of sit right on the lap here. Perfect
[9088.09s -> 9096.63s]  little ergonomic form factor, whatever you want to call it. Small keyboard. No, no sponsor. It's
[9096.63s -> 9106.76s]  just, I just like it. It's just works great for what it's I'm using it for. And that's it. All
[9106.76s -> 9113.13s]  right. What the hell was I just doing? Getting jewels from downstairs. Is this a scary part?
[9113.13s -> 9146.20s]  Hey, Hey, bro, bro, bro. Is this a scary part? Where's this? I have everything reloaded. You're
[9146.20s -> 9156.39s]  really into bro tonight. Yeah. I'm just hitting me. I'm in one of those. I'm just in a mood. You
[9156.39s -> 9164.63s]  know, you get in a mood, you just kind of run with it. Okay. So I need to just go up all the way up
[9164.63s -> 9242.30s]  here. I got to go out the front door. I can push out of the way. Yeah. It's going to be some mood
[9242.30s -> 9279.45s]  lighting back here. Eventually. It'd be nice. Not just the Pac-Man crew. Well, stereo. It's a Nell
[9279.45s -> 9299.30s]  S Ron reunion at Odo. El Mundo. Uh, Ness, a newestro brand. Well, I could've just clicked it.
[9299.30s -> 9307.06s]  The outsider is in the villa. Assemble the village. Awaken our great child. Okay.
[9317.13s -> 9322.57s]  Come take a look. New item. I've got something new for you, man. Laser sight,
[9323.96s -> 9339.11s]  rocket launcher. What you see is what I've got. Oh, a case upgrade. Do I have anything to sell?
[9339.75s -> 9344.74s]  Splendid. Uh, yeah, I can do, I'll get the case.
[9363.75s -> 9374.47s]  All right. Did I get a knife upgrade? I think I really should make up for a lack of skill.
[9376.79s -> 9379.51s]  Maybe just all the way I'll do. Yeah. Case upgrade. I'll do it too.
[9380.15s -> 9393.93s]  Shit. I need two bucks. Ruby's all rubbish. It makes no difference. The price.
[9395.30s -> 9417.43s]  That's our choice today. Thank you. All yours. Stranger. Where would it come back anytime?
[9418.39s -> 9434.66s]  Much better. Can I do any of this? Nope. Sell the shells. Oh, welcome. That's true.
[9434.66s -> 9442.49s]  I don't think I plan on doing shotgun. I'll save the money.
[9447.30s -> 9469.18s]  What can I interest you in? Nope. Next time then. All right, let's go. Hey, what the fuck?
[9469.74s -> 9497.93s]  I still have not figured out how to do the, um, I just almost got crippled. Uh, the grapple thing.
[9499.54s -> 9588.52s]  Oh my God. I beat the shit out of me. Hey, really? It won't work. Why is your webcam like this?
[9589.32s -> 9593.98s]  Uh, it's temporary. It's uh, it's not where it's going to be, but I think it looks fine.
[9595.10s -> 9599.42s]  You guys, you guys spend way too much time caring about the webcam angle and you should be asking
[9599.42s -> 9606.46s]  about how I just missed three headshots in a row. That's the real questions you should be asking.
[9618.68s -> 9623.72s]  How did you miss three headshots in a row? See, that's why, isn't that better? That's much better.
[9631.16s -> 9671.85s]  Okay. There's stuff here. I already got, where is this jewel in this house downstairs? No,
[9671.85s -> 9699.58s]  it's in the other house over there. There it is. Very cool. That's yep. Golden chicken egg.
[9703.85s -> 9710.12s]  And this is a key that I don't have. Okay. Uh, I want to get all the treasures. So sorry,
[9710.12s -> 9714.78s]  everybody. I know we might get bored, but I want to just go get them or at least the ones I can
[9714.78s -> 9758.15s]  get. So I'm going to go into the town hall, which is okay. How do I get back into there and why did
[9758.15s -> 9770.54s]  I not get it when I was already over there? That's the most annoying part for me. Wasn't I just in
[9770.54s -> 9802.41s]  there? Was I not? Apparently I wasn't. Oh, well, how long is the DLC? Um, if you, I think it's like
[9802.73s -> 9808.34s]  three to five hours, something like that. Usually about two or four depending on who's playing it
[9809.14s -> 9863.18s]  and I'm playing it. So two hours of speed run time and a lot of health. Oh, that's why. Okay.
[9873.19s -> 9881.88s]  Ooh, cool. Uh, I guess the best way to see how far I am right now is how many chapters are there?
[9884.92s -> 9918.74s]  Six. I imagine probably five, six, seven, seven. Yeah. Everything loaded.
[9919.22s -> 9930.54s]  Kind of. All right. So now I'm going to get over here. What's the best way to get over there from
[9930.54s -> 9971.27s]  here? This way. What time are you born? 12.00 AM. I don't know, like six. That's a grenade.
[9981.48s -> 9987.40s]  It's a bouncy ball. You throw a bouncy ball at me. The bounce on that was fucking ridiculous.
[9992.82s -> 10015.54s]  There's no reason why that should have bounced that high. Oh, I thought he went down into the
[10015.54s -> 10067.61s]  thing. Okay. Damn. You have an aura of a Looney Tunes physics character. I don't know. Something.
[10067.61s -> 10108.01s]  Shit. The knife is broken. Shit. I thought I was far enough away. Am I damaging the knife when I
[10108.01s -> 10131.67s]  swing at that? When I hit the crates in the ground? I actually might be. No. Okay. Anything
[10131.67s -> 10174.20s]  in there? Can't get up top. Hold on. I can't jump into one of those windows. Really? There's nothing
[10174.28s -> 10218.17s]  over here. What kind of horse shit is that? Sell those. Somebody has a grenade somewhere. I love
[10218.17s -> 10231.56s]  that you pulled apart your sectional for this stream. You mean all of them going forward.
[10231.56s -> 10245.22s]  It ain't just for this one. It's for the rest of them. So Professor X. It looks like Professor
[10245.22s -> 10279.77s]  X's chair. Does it? What does the back of Professor X's chair look like? Something's wrong with my
[10279.77s -> 10337.51s]  game. Oh, I got seen. I thought that was a baby crying. Sorry, big guy. Can't let you go that way.
[10337.51s -> 10362.33s]  Oh, go. Okay. Cool. I'm going to destroy this shit. I throw a grenade in his mouth. I have so
[10362.33s -> 10403.51s]  many holes in his head. No, I was trying to jump onto the thing. Get on. Get on. How do I get on?
[10403.51s -> 10493.19s]  Cool. Cool. Oh, shit. Let's get the fuck out of here. Is the game loud at all? Looks like it's
[10493.19s -> 10510.81s]  kind of loud. I need to drop it by like 10%. It's good. Okay. Looks like it's getting up kind of in
[10510.81s -> 10520.38s]  the yellow. Sweet dreams. Now I'm just going to loot the whole thing because there's going to be
[10520.38s -> 10529.27s]  a lot of items around, right? Usually there is. Hey, got a smoke? I do. The kind you like. Now
[10529.27s -> 10536.25s]  where's the amber? Unfortunately, it's not on me at the moment. And you really shouldn't be telling
[10536.25s -> 10542.49s]  me. What a good job I did. Didn't we just do this like an hour ago? Managed to hide it right before
[10542.49s -> 10553.75s]  I got caught. Which is why I'm still alive. The deal was we get you out of here when you deliver
[10553.75s -> 10564.23s]  the amber. No amber, no protection, Luis. Such a stickler for details, huh, Ida? Okay, then.
[10564.87s -> 10572.49s]  I'll go get it now. How about that? It's loud during fights but quiet during cutscenes.
[10573.54s -> 10579.16s]  Everything is up all the way. Maybe I should turn the effects down.
[10586.97s -> 10627.03s]  Fine. Yeah, it's all right. I'll just leave it. Chapter four. I feel like if those things were
[10627.03s -> 10636.68s]  real, you wouldn't. You would just fly into the air and just die. You would do the grapple hook
[10636.68s -> 10640.84s]  and you'd be going 50, 60 miles per hour. You would just go straight into the air.
[10641.32s -> 10649.34s]  Or straight into the fucking wall and smash your head. It would tear your arm off.
[10649.34s -> 10653.10s]  Yeah, you would dislocate your shoulder. Both shoulders if you had it with both hands.
[10682.71s -> 10689.27s]  They are both infected. They need this medicine. It slows the infection and I know it works.
[10690.07s -> 10701.22s]  I used it on myself. So, why does this matter to me? Because you two are infected. That's what
[10701.22s -> 10705.30s]  I researched for all these years, Ida. And I see the symptoms already showing in your eyes.
[10706.26s -> 10716.31s]  You must already feel the effects, eh? The medicine will stop them for a time.
[10717.24s -> 10728.39s]  Just trust me. A lot to gain and nothing to lose. Okay, but this is your last chance.
[10729.19s -> 10741.91s]  We do this first and then the amber. I'll let Leon know.
[10741.91s -> 10747.61s]  Hola, Luis here. Las Plagas is fucked. Imagine getting like, imagine seeing one.
[10748.65s -> 10753.74s]  Because I have a present I want to give you. Medicine that will help you suppress
[10753.74s -> 10758.89s]  the progress of your problem. I can't imagine having to like, see one.
[10759.77s -> 10762.55s]  Come to the courtyard. Who is this guy?
[10763.03s -> 10776.44s]  Meet up there. Ciao. Sorry to keep you waiting. Shall we? Ladies first.
[10777.50s -> 10781.30s]  How chivalrous. I didn't even look if there's any items in the room.
[10785.64s -> 10811.10s]  There's a hidden laboratory downstairs. My stuff should be there. Along with the suppressant.
[10812.22s -> 10829.38s]  I don't care about a laboratory. We're not going there. We're not going there. I don't want to go
[10829.38s -> 10837.66s]  there. We're not going there. There's way till Resident Evil 30 when you get to pick the path
[10837.66s -> 10844.44s]  you want to go on. Do you want to go to the lab? Highlight left. Do you want to go to the church?
[10844.44s -> 10860.28s]  Highlight right. And the whole time when you're making a decision, what other character in the
[10860.28s -> 10878.12s]  cutscene does this? Which way do you want to go? Hey, we don't go out there. I fucked up the line.
[10878.12s -> 10887.13s]  I can't. Sorry. All I hear in my head is beep, beep. Like a fucking microwave. The food is done.
[10887.13s -> 10898.46s]  I screwed it up so bad. What was I hearing? Was I hearing this?
[10902.73s -> 10918.47s]  Wait, what? Are you making fucking popcorn up here? Where'd he go? Oh shit. This is what I
[10918.47s -> 10942.97s]  get for not paying attention. Who else is in the room? That was a bugleberry voice. That was an
[10942.97s -> 11017.51s]  oh yes. Shit. No, no, no, no. Not yet. I want, I want apple cake. I want apple cake. You've been
[11017.51s -> 11029.40s]  fighting this one guy down here for so long. How many bullets did you shoot into this guy? A lot.
[11029.40s -> 11035.66s]  I want apple cake. I think three of you are going to know what that's from.
[11036.06s -> 11067.40s]  Well, yeah. Monster rancher too. I want apple cake. Uh, I need to heal. Should I just take the
[11067.40s -> 11099.98s]  golden egg? No, it's worth a lot of money. He's dying. What's wrong with him? Why is she running
[11099.98s -> 11129.83s]  so weird? Oh, he's fucking dead. He's dead. Like in five seconds. I want apple cake.
[11150.89s -> 11161.96s]  Get back here. Don't inhale the smoke. It's like he's breathing in as hard as he can.
[11175.19s -> 11192.98s]  Just don't breathe forehead. That's right. If you're trying to kill yourself, can you do it
[11192.98s -> 11202.49s]  after you've delivered the amber? It's all gone. Burnt to nothing. Why is this so important to you?
[11203.45s -> 11211.40s]  There are things I must set right, but that is impossible now. It's all over
[11212.12s -> 11222.62s]  and they can't help them anymore. Pull yourself together, Louise. Nice hamster step. You know how
[11222.62s -> 11237.27s]  just do it. Yes, it is possible. The ingredients are out here in the castle. Yes, I need time.
[11237.27s -> 11247.03s]  I can still get you your amber. All right, then let's go. How many times have I said shut up
[11247.03s -> 11251.91s]  that I can go back at least five and figure out our next move. I'm just kidding, though. Don't
[11251.91s -> 11266.86s]  worry. Am I? Maybe not. It's at least more than one. Maybe not. I got the item.
[11269.43s -> 11297.37s]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Slow down. You'd rather be doing anything else right
[11297.37s -> 11303.74s]  now. That's not true. I'm having this is fun. I'm having a great time. No, I trust me. You want
[11303.74s -> 11313.40s]  about? Well, you can work for the devil as you get me out of here. I'm not. I'm you guys are
[11313.40s -> 11325.00s]  mistaking. Relaxed with bored. Boomer face cam gameplay. Yeah, that's how it is now. Sorry.
[11325.56s -> 11335.96s]  The way it is now. I think I'm having to join myself immensely right now. This is wonderful.
[11342.14s -> 11348.74s]  Oh, yeah. I'm a look. Where's the key? You should be able to use the sword.
[11348.98s -> 11379.22s]  Shit. You need a blankie. It won't be my finest effort. I might just work all the
[11379.22s -> 11383.86s]  all the way up to my to my neck, the bottom of my neck. Find these ingredients. And one of those
[11383.86s -> 11391.50s]  goofy hats. Just maybe I can make a new batch of medicine. I'm not a friend. You go way too hot to
[11391.50s -> 11396.30s]  do that. Not right now. Go grab the amber. Wish me luck. Maybe during the winter time. It'd be
[11396.30s -> 11403.94s]  funny to do that. Look like an asshole for a little bit. All right. We need red ink, gold
[11403.94s -> 11417.14s]  bottle, blue butterfly. They're probably just on the map. They are. Oh, there's a lot of shit.
[11418.26s -> 11452.68s]  OK, good luck. This is where we parked this stuff in here. Not really. Can you summarize the plot
[11452.68s -> 11463.14s]  in five seconds or less? Bugs get into your brain and control you. And Wesker has a vial,
[11463.14s -> 11472.76s]  but it keeps going like this. I think that sums it up pretty well. All right. First,
[11473.24s -> 11493.61s]  the bindery. It's this part. All right. Let me take a quick look. Nothing really in here. So
[11493.61s -> 11507.62s]  I'm not going to fuck with that. A raccoon. Guess this is fate.
[11517.34s -> 11528.14s]  Awesome way. Hey, that's a graphic stone like yourself.
[11534.02s -> 11542.41s]  Stones. Welcome. Somebody. Somebody is sub five dollars a month for me to say that every time.
[11542.41s -> 11545.13s]  I just want to make sure somebody pays five bucks a month for me to do that.
[11554.36s -> 11560.04s]  Ruby's all rubbish. She makes no difference. The price. A deal well struck.
[11561.80s -> 11573.05s]  Does this thing maxed out capacity? Dazzled. Does this have a maximum craftsmanship or no?
[11576.14s -> 11602.17s]  That's good work. If I do say so myself later, I think that's kind of it. Red nine. I don't
[11602.17s -> 11608.65s]  really necessarily care. I don't always have this in stock. Stranger.
[11611.43s -> 11615.75s]  Minus one gunpowder when you use my crafting. That's kind of good.
[11615.75s -> 11620.89s]  Flash. Actually, I should get that. Oh, remind me that that's their top shape.
[11622.01s -> 11639.94s]  Thank you. Check out my wares again soon. The worst. That's the worst harm.
[11640.74s -> 11673.08s]  Seem that bad. Do I just put a bunch of these away? Dude, green weed laughing my ass off.
[11686.09s -> 11699.74s]  Holy shit. Mod that guy or ban that guy. OK, I I got it saved. I just a compulsive saver.
[11699.74s -> 11725.18s]  I'm going to do it again. And let's continue. Green needle rainstorm. Green needle.
[11741.67s -> 11779.22s]  I just repaired this thing that's already broken. Incoming puzzle. Fuck. Not yet. Oh,
[11779.22s -> 11817.30s]  yeah. OK. Puzzle time. Puzzle time. All right. That's a that's a fan. This bird doesn't match.
[11817.30s -> 11823.45s]  Maybe. No, maybe it does. So what's you already did this one in normal mode.
[11828.54s -> 11835.40s]  Hear me out for a sec. Yesterday, when you watched the Resident Evil four playthrough
[11835.40s -> 11843.00s]  that I did and you watched this part. And today I'm streaming this. You have to remember
[11843.80s -> 11851.46s]  that was recorded four and a half months ago. So you got it right there. And here you are
[11851.46s -> 11858.63s]  one day later. So I just did this. I just did it on your screen in a while.
[11859.19s -> 11873.40s]  I was doing the smiley face. My hair looks so bad. It looks like there's a joke under here.
[11873.40s -> 11882.81s]  It looks like I'm about to lift this up and there's going to be like an animal under it.
[11882.89s -> 11896.33s]  I look like fucking Edgar Allen Poe. Do I? Holy shit. That's kind of cool. All right. I'm going
[11896.33s -> 11903.90s]  to rock it. I'm going to rock with that. All right. What was the point I was making? Oh,
[11903.90s -> 11929.86s]  yeah. I don't remember. It's been a while. It's been like two. Bird on the left.
[11930.42s -> 11937.54s]  And this be a square up here. I mean, there's only so many combinations this could be, right?
[11939.50s -> 11959.18s]  What's going on here? Doesn't this look correct? I'm biting my lip. Get off the cam.
[11977.29s -> 11986.60s]  Hmm. I just don't remember. I need another orange one, don't I? Is there another one in the room
[11986.60s -> 12042.44s]  that I'm just missing? Hmm. The fuck am I doing wrong here? What the heck? I'm subbed to this
[12042.44s -> 12058.41s]  dork. Oh, what the heck's happening here? Obviously, this needs to be a square. This
[12058.41s -> 12087.26s]  needs to be a I don't what I'm like, I feel like I'm missing a piece. I guess not. The hell am I
[12087.26s -> 12092.86s]  doing wrong? It's there's only so many this only like what, 16 combinations is only like 20
[12092.86s -> 12121.21s]  combinations. This could be. Hmm. I am munching on my lip and I got to stop. Hold on. True.
[12121.21s -> 12131.14s]  When a puzzle comes up, I just start tearing into my bottom lip. Dorito goes into the wind.
[12143.27s -> 12166.30s]  So you would need the bird needs wind. The dress needs a bird and the bird needs wind.
[12170.50s -> 12178.79s]  Bird needs that. I actually don't know. I have no idea. This shouldn't be this hard,
[12178.79s -> 12185.74s]  but I'm playing checkers when you need to play. I'm playing chess when you need to play
[12186.46s -> 12193.22s]  like hopscotch, like it's not even hard. I'm saying cheese, cheese, Dorito, cheese, cheese,
[12193.22s -> 12207.54s]  cheese, Dorito, Dorito. Illuminati symbol. Tornado. Tornado. Tornado needs a weather.
[12207.54s -> 12218.36s]  It's bad weather. It's I'm playing Pictionary again. Like the one of these has to be down here
[12218.36s -> 12233.43s]  or here. What am I missing? What's happening to me? Dorito sugar. Yeah. Stinky cheese. No sloth.
[12244.28s -> 12274.04s]  I feel like I've done every single combination you could possibly do. Um, I don't do puzzles.
[12274.04s -> 12279.38s]  I do pick Russ and that's it. I just know how to run wicked fast for like five seconds.
[12280.46s -> 12286.63s]  And like, I like, I, I, I don't know. I don't get it. How many combinations can it possibly
[12286.71s -> 12293.53s]  be that I haven't done umbrellas, dress, and bird. And I did this four months ago.
[12293.53s -> 12299.22s]  A person is watching the video of me saying the same shit right now. Pull it up. I'm doing,
[12299.22s -> 12302.42s]  I'm saying the exact same. You know what? How about we just pull the video up when I'm doing it?
[12302.42s -> 12311.98s]  And I'll say, I'll just ask myself, I will talk to myself. I don't even know where it is. That's
[12311.98s -> 12314.94s]  a, that's like a whole, that's a whole can of worms. I don't even know what timestamp it is.
[12315.58s -> 12331.67s]  What's the timestamp on the, on the VOD in a mod link, the VOD with timestamp. I need to open the,
[12333.50s -> 12359.37s]  uh, I need to have mod chat open. Yeah. Okay. I got it. I got it open now. Wait, wait, wait,
[12359.37s -> 12381.51s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
[12381.51s -> 12425.66s]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. We just don't know. You don't know. Let me ask,
[12425.66s -> 12452.07s]  let me ask you, uh, me from like four months ago. Did someone find it? I don't think so.
[12453.90s -> 12460.50s]  It's like, it's like three streams, but I just, I just don't get it. Like, and I,
[12460.50s -> 12467.93s]  it's going to be so obvious, but I just don't care. Do you know what I mean? I would just throw
[12467.93s -> 12471.29s]  a grenade at this wall. I would, you know what? I would just call somebody. I would be like,
[12471.29s -> 12475.53s]  Hey Wesker, what's up? Hey, what's up, dude? I'm sitting at a wall. Look, I'm the guy that
[12475.53s -> 12480.41s]  runs fast. And like, you know, you keep me around because I tell jokes and I, you know, I'm a writer
[12482.01s -> 12486.65s]  I'd be dead in a minute, by the way. Oh, oh, you're, oh, you're a writer. You tell you write
[12486.65s -> 12492.17s]  jokes. Yeah. I don't fucking need you at all. Actually. Let me, I don't need a writer.
[12497.74s -> 12501.37s]  Uh, what do you want? All right. So I'm looking at this thing right now, Wesker.
[12502.09s -> 12509.21s]  Uh, there's a bird and there's a cutoff symbol. There's a cutoff bird. There's a fan at the top
[12510.01s -> 12518.33s]  and that's orange. The bird and the fan are both orange and this fan has a square on it. Okay.
[12519.13s -> 12526.57s]  Okay. Are you with me here? So far? On the right, there is a, a dress in a hexagon shape.
[12526.57s -> 12530.97s]  Dress. What kind of dress is it? It's, it's got one of those poofy dresses from like the
[12530.97s -> 12536.41s]  1400s or something. A poofy 1400s dress. Yes. That, that's exactly it. The ones that like,
[12536.41s -> 12540.89s]  they have like big cage in them. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. The big ones. Okay. I got that down.
[12541.53s -> 12544.65s]  Okay. Then the bottom, this, remember it's two umbrellas. So there's a second umbrella at the
[12544.65s -> 12548.89s]  bottom of the hexagon as well. Regular umbrella. It's just like one of those umbrellas. It's got
[12548.89s -> 12554.41s]  like frills on it. Frilly umbrella. Also from the 1400s. Yes. Actually, yes. Okay. So let me think
[12554.41s -> 12574.25s]  here. So what I think is, and there's four slots. They have four slots. Uh, let them out. I don't
[12574.25s -> 12581.13s]  care. Just let them out. Just tell me what to do. I don't care. I don't care. Just tell me what it
[12581.13s -> 12586.31s]  is. We can do it together. It's fun that way. We're doing it together. We're going to do it
[12586.31s -> 12597.46s]  together. Yeah. See chat. We're hanging out. We're doing it together. Rotate them. What do you mean
[12597.46s -> 12627.02s]  rotate them? Okay. Listen, you have to understand. I thought that was telling me that I could move
[12627.02s -> 12639.69s]  them. I, the Q and the E were, were not rotate in my brain. Wow. Shit. Oh, that's on the internet
[12639.69s -> 12643.13s]  now. Do you know what I mean? Like that's not, that's on, that's like on the, that's on the
[12643.13s -> 12652.54s]  internet now forever. I'm sitting kind of far away from the screen. I it's like, it's a different
[12652.54s -> 12659.82s]  setup. I, to me, the, the rotate was not there. Oh my God. That's yeah. I can't believe it.
[12665.40s -> 12672.60s]  I had to remember. I'm not pretending at all at all. Zero pretending absolute zero.
[12673.40s -> 12679.00s]  I was just so lasered it. I don't even know how I was so lazy. That's the worst moment ever.
[12679.72s -> 12689.11s]  You don't have the attention span for directions. I, that, that's probably the worst, uh, the worst
[12689.11s -> 12700.47s]  ever, ever in 15 years of doing this. I just had to go like this. And I don't, I don't have an
[12700.47s -> 12710.14s]  excuse for you. I really don't. My only excuse is I can see it now is just ADHD. That's the only
[12710.14s -> 12716.92s]  excuse. That's it. I can't tell you another reason why I genuinely could not tell you another reason
[12716.92s -> 12726.65s]  why, because I, my brain, the Q and the E were not on the screen. They were just not on screen.
[12726.65s -> 12730.94s]  They were gone. They weren't there until you brought that up. That's crazy. What a fucking
[12730.94s -> 12739.32s]  case study. That's an unbelievable case study for ADHD because wow. We, you just watched it.
[12739.32s -> 12746.06s]  Did I do it in the last one too? We've got the timestamp for the last one. Did I do it in the
[12746.06s -> 12759.46s]  last one? Glasses in the cutscene. Yeah, they really are just ruining everything. All right.
[12759.46s -> 12777.77s]  This is the maze part, isn't it? My name is May. You can tell what game I was playing
[12778.73s -> 12801.21s]  six months ago. Oh my fucking God. I can't believe I didn't see it. How I do it again. I do it again.
[12801.21s -> 12805.69s]  I do it again. It happens. It happens back here too. I don't rotate it guys. We're talking about
[12805.69s -> 12814.20s]  this as consistency. It's consistency. It is absolute consistency. I'm just, I'm not, I haven't
[12814.20s -> 12822.36s]  spun them once. I think I'm, am I missing one? Let's just listen to them for a little while.
[12823.00s -> 12839.86s]  Oh wait, you can flip them. Oops. Took them a lot quicker. Hey, I'm retired now. It's all right.
[12839.86s -> 12862.82s]  Okay. Well it's been, sure been fun. All right. So this goes here. This goes here and
[12864.47s -> 12909.37s]  this needs to be a square. Where is the, where is that? I don't have a, I can't,
[12909.37s -> 12912.33s]  I can't tell you what just happened there. The first ingredient should be in this room.
[12916.94s -> 12921.90s]  The only thing I can attribute it to is being sitting in this new room and being like this.
[12922.62s -> 12938.81s]  That's it. Oh well. Oh well. Hey, hey, hey, the mod chat. How could you let me fucking do it?
[12938.81s -> 12941.85s]  You should have said rotate the fucking cubes, man. You should have, I should have looked over
[12941.85s -> 12946.41s]  and it should have been like, hey, rotate the fucking cubes already. You should have gave me,
[12946.41s -> 12958.52s]  you should have given me some extra fucking direction. Wait, did they? No, they didn't.
[12958.52s -> 12990.90s]  No, they didn't. Okay. Let's go touch it. Ooh, I get to do the shooting thing. Is that in this?
[12991.46s -> 13005.70s]  You're sitting too far away. That actually might be what happened. And I know, you know,
[13005.70s -> 13012.14s]  streamer dumb. I know. I know. But I think that's probably why I didn't see it. I was moving them
[13012.14s -> 13016.78s]  too quickly and I, you know, I'm not going to give excuses anymore. That was really stupid.
[13016.78s -> 13042.22s]  Oh well. Okay. Watch your eyes. He's too, he's too comfortable. Uh, I think my brain
[13042.22s -> 13050.22s]  saw them as like A and D to like move them, not rotate. Okay. I mean, let me stop giving excuses
[13050.22s -> 13067.29s]  to why that just happened and play the game. So where is it? Red ink or blue ink or something?
[13067.29s -> 13092.02s]  Where is it? Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get shooting. So shoot the shields. Who has a shield? Okay. So
[13092.02s -> 13112.90s]  what's the order? 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. That not correct. All right. Wait, wait, hold on. Zoom
[13112.90s -> 13157.21s]  it in. Let me get close. Let me go. Let me get close. One is, so wait, it's what is it? It's 1,
[13159.02s -> 13180.90s]  1. Hold on. 1, 2, 3. Is that right? 1, 2, 3. No, it's the way that they're on the wall.
[13180.90s -> 13222.38s]  So where the fuck is this one? Look around. Oh Jesus. Okay. There's other ones. Okay. So that
[13222.46s -> 13231.42s]  was, this is it here. So that's the right one over here. And then it's one. Where is this?
[13234.98s -> 13244.74s]  That's okay. That's like an elk, elk, elk, lady, little lady. All right. So where's the,
[13244.74s -> 13252.86s]  where's the elk? I mean, bro, what does that even matter? Or you just shoot it in the right
[13252.86s -> 13263.27s]  direction? 1, 2, 3, like this. Am I playing chess again? I don't know. Hold on. Did I have it right
[13263.27s -> 13287.24s]  when I spun it? 1, 2. Yeah. Okay. Spin it. 1, 2, 3, 4. Is that not right? There's no way. Well,
[13287.24s -> 13296.92s]  I, I flipped it though, right? You're playing battleship on a chessboard. I'm laughing so hard
[13296.92s -> 13342.60s]  right now. Okay. Well that's the correct one. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2. I gotta do it upside down. 1, 2, 3.
[13342.60s -> 13356.17s]  Why is he flipping it? I must be fucking tired. Am I like sleepy? Holy shit. I am like 40. Okay.
[13358.98s -> 13387.48s]  1, 1, 2, 3. Shit. Jesus. I gotta get my fucking eyes examined. Holy shit.
[13389.82s -> 13406.65s]  Oh my God. I'm like, I'm like too comfortable. Jesus. That was 15 minutes. Dude. Is it,
[13406.65s -> 13415.37s]  is there carbon monoxide going into your room? Jeez, man. That was fucking ridiculous.
[13455.59s -> 13488.65s]  Change the outfit? I can't. I have to keep it like this. It's too good.
[13491.93s -> 13515.70s]  Right. How about we continue this discussion another time? See you around. He looks like
[13515.70s -> 13555.19s]  Jerry Seinfeld. Okay. Let's go. Do I have any of the fun hats for Leon? Okay. So,
[13557.61s -> 13581.70s]  there is another thing down here. The gate and gong have the same sense.
[13583.06s -> 13589.61s]  Seems simple enough. All right. Snakes. This is a snake right here, right?
[13590.73s -> 13610.01s]  Does it just shoot snake twice? Is there another snake? There is. You should bedazzle the recliner.
[13610.81s -> 13675.45s]  No, not this shit. Turn and run? What the fuck? Open the door. Um, oh, you need to wear your
[13675.45s -> 13688.41s]  glasses. I think it's a combination of visual distance and ADHD object permanence. Like in
[13688.41s -> 13692.33s]  my brain right now, I can say, hey, that's an elk right there. And when I turn around,
[13692.33s -> 13711.88s]  it's an elephant. It's gone. It's carbon monoxide. It's it's no, I have a detector.
[13711.88s -> 13721.38s]  You're making me think for a second. You're like, oh, I'm like, oh shit. Being high doesn't help.
[13722.02s -> 13733.27s]  Yeah, that's true. Okay. Now for the second ingredient. Give me these jewels. I want it.
[13733.27s -> 13778.18s]  Looks like something goes here. Okay. Oh shit. It's one of these guys. Holy shit. That was cool.
[13812.09s -> 13861.16s]  I probably have to pick that up again. I'm imagining more stuff. Okay. No key. What?
[13861.16s -> 13930.76s]  I think I know what's coming. Yeah. Okay. Gold bottle. Oh my goodness. Okay. Oh boy.
[13930.76s -> 13961.03s]  Whoa. What just hit me? Almost out of bullets. Oh, you piece of shit. Leave me alone.
[13977.94s -> 13993.90s]  Come here. Come here. Come here. Oh my God. You little shits over there. Leave me alone.
[13994.70s -> 14050.36s]  Holy. Holy. Now I get a minute. Let me this, this, this jewels in here. Okay. So I have both
[14050.36s -> 14073.37s]  the bottles. Do I want to do anything else in this room or no? I don't think so. Do I have a
[14073.37s -> 14125.69s]  favorite gem? Um, probably birthstone. That's the easy answer. Stone of birth. What? Uh, should I go
[14125.69s -> 14139.26s]  back and check for that treasure? I feel like I should, but I think it's a key. I think it's a
[14139.26s -> 14151.59s]  key. I don't think I have a key to open it. I need the gold bottle. I need to keep the gold
[14151.59s -> 14185.19s]  bottle. So I'm not leaving that. There are blue medallions here. Okay. Out there. There's no
[14185.19s -> 14205.05s]  inputs on these. I guess not. All right. I want, what do I want to do here?
[14208.58s -> 14224.28s]  Starting to get good luck to you. There you are. I'll keep a lookout for items.
[14225.64s -> 14247.13s]  Okay. Hmm. Is there, is there another knife that I find later? I can do the whole DLC tonight.
[14248.65s -> 14260.74s]  Probably. Yeah, probably. There's only a few more chapters. There's only two more chapters.
[14261.46s -> 14277.45s]  Yeah. It's a lock drawer. All right. The last one is over way up here.
[14277.45s -> 14290.82s]  So I'm going to go through the courtyard. I want that, whatever that is. Okay. Louise,
[14291.38s -> 14302.70s]  that's two. Last one should be in a room accessible from the castle wall. And here's
[14302.70s -> 14319.94s]  some more info I've recovered about that old rock. Sending it now. Okay. Reload everything.
[14319.94s -> 14327.58s]  And where are the medallions? Can I jump this? I don't need to jump it. It's just right here.
[14328.22s -> 14353.21s]  Okay. That was easy. All right. Let's go medallion hunting. Oh wait, there are fishes in there,
[14353.21s -> 14377.42s]  aren't there? Does that work? Oh, it does. Probably. This is just health, right? Take the
[14377.42s -> 14426.58s]  free health. Wait a minute. Something over here. I think that's it. Yep. Turn on your real face
[14426.58s -> 14444.68s]  scan. You don't like my, my made up one. It's like a weird mustache. There's only actually
[14444.68s -> 14468.50s]  one treasure in here. Sting. Now, where are the others? Oh, God damn it. You wouldn't just let
[14468.50s -> 14505.35s]  me through, could you? Don't kill him. Oh, he fell. I didn't have to do anything. Shut up.
[14505.35s -> 14531.16s]  Can I throw a grenade in there? I think I got him. I got some. Oh my goodness. Run. Okay. You
[14531.16s -> 14564.57s]  are dead. Thank goodness. Yes. This thing does not do a whole lot of damage without any upgrades.
[14565.21s -> 14610.78s]  I want that. So you better believe I'm going to go get it. How do I get? It's over here.
[14610.94s -> 14648.94s]  Oh, hold on. Is it a chest? It is. I think I have enough to upgrade to. Oh, not good. Not good. Not
[14648.94s -> 14678.06s]  good. Not good. Not good. Damn. I got a million health. Okay. That was ridiculous. Bro, you are
[14678.06s -> 14700.36s]  fucking gaming. I am. Okay. So one up here, one over here. I don't think there's any more treasure.
[14702.36s -> 14732.30s]  Uh, hold on. Let me go up here. I could just go over there. Where's this one? It's in the building.
[14732.30s -> 14744.70s]  I like the stash. I get, uh, I don't know how long it's going to be here for. It will only be
[14744.70s -> 14758.39s]  here as long as it'll be here for enough time. Enough time. All right. Where is this thing?
[14758.39s -> 14812.38s]  It's like in that building. Is it in the building? How do I get in this building? No, no, no. There
[14812.38s -> 14832.44s]  we go. Okay. It's in here, right? No, it's not. Where is it? Where is it? Did I run by like three
[14832.44s -> 14857.03s]  times? Ah, okay. There it is. Last one is in the corner. Is it just right up here? You look like
[14857.03s -> 14865.48s]  one of the weasels from Roger Rabbit. Oh, that's awesome. I'm so glad you just said that. That's,
[14865.48s -> 14875.21s]  that's who I am. That's legitimately who I am as a person. All of them combined. I feel like I embody
[14875.21s -> 14885.83s]  every single one of those characters together as one, as one unit. All right. So I can turn,
[14886.31s -> 14899.19s]  I'll turn it in later. Now I'm going to go through here. Can I get there from this one?
[14912.38s -> 14928.82s]  Egg? Oh, it's a leaf. All right. Reload this. Reload this thing. What an egomaniac. Um,
[14932.14s -> 14936.54s]  they all died. They all die at the end of the movie, by the way. I just want to make sure
[14936.54s -> 14944.44s]  you're aware of that. Like they all die. What do you mean, bro? What? What do you mean? What?
[14944.44s -> 14954.92s]  Spoiled? Spoilers? Did I not say spoilers? It's the movie's 40 years old and I'm making that up
[14954.92s -> 14963.06s]  too. They don't all die. I thought that was required reading for the stream already. Oh,
[14963.06s -> 14968.42s]  I thought we already all seen it already a million times. Sorry about that. It's like a,
[14968.42s -> 14973.27s]  it's like one part of the movie. Don't worry. That was summer homework. Well,
[14973.27s -> 14983.54s]  that was summer homework in like 2019. I thought we'd all seen it already. I think we all have
[14983.54s -> 14996.33s]  some, maybe some of you haven't. I don't know. It's a great movie. I love that movie. I think
[14996.33s -> 15002.42s]  most of you've already seen it. I'd say majority probably. All right. One's in chat. If you have
[15002.42s -> 15011.11s]  not seen Roger Rabbit, I feel like you, there's no way that many of you haven't seen it. No way.
[15013.54s -> 15020.06s]  Really? Oh, well go watch it. What are you doing? Like one of the best movies ever.
[15042.84s -> 15073.37s]  No treasures. What? I did not mean to press that. That's right. I still have some unfinished
[15073.37s -> 15088.38s]  business to take care of. Did I not kill the thing? I thought I did. Nothing there. Okay.
[15088.70s -> 15095.21s]  Grab this. Somebody's on the phone.
[15106.34s -> 15113.43s]  Sorry. Nothing yet, but my little helper is creating quite the commotion. I have a little
[15113.43s -> 15131.10s]  helper? Everything will work out just fine. Oh, Louis. Louis. Leon. Yeah, Louis. Was that guy's
[15131.10s -> 15155.34s]  name again? Louis? Jesus. Leon. Changed your mind yet? Yeah. Assuming you haven't. I've got a tip
[15155.34s -> 15161.21s]  for you. Seems like something big is about to go down in the throne room. Babysitting's tough, huh?
[15163.08s -> 15167.80s]  Hey, it's me Wesker again. You know that anybody can go on a channel and hear anything
[15167.80s -> 15174.82s]  across a fucking walkie talkie. I just want to make sure you understood that. Wesker out.
[15179.86s -> 15185.13s]  Okay. I am going to go this way. Wait. I'm going to go this way actually, because I want to go.
[15185.13s -> 15216.70s]  Should I get this treasure? Yes. Thanks for answering my question. It's down even further.
[15232.12s -> 15237.98s]  What are your tips on growing a mustache? I cannot give you any because I grow a terrible mustache.
[15238.62s -> 15243.46s]  I've heard you have to just stick with it, but even if I stick with it for a month or two,
[15243.46s -> 15252.55s]  it looks like a bird shit on the top of my lip. I don't know if I have any tips for you.
[15258.71s -> 15293.54s]  All right. Let's check in up here. I will check below, but not yet. Now I'll go below.
[15304.82s -> 15322.73s]  All right. So this one will open if I do that again. Where are you going? It's not going to
[15322.73s -> 15346.95s]  happen. You would fit in well in an American civil war teledrama. It's an evil mustache.
[15346.95s -> 15373.90s]  It is kind of evil. That's all right. Okay. So that is closed. We need to open. Wait,
[15374.46s -> 15380.79s]  anything else back here? Was there another sun or anything? I'll just open it again.
[15383.54s -> 15399.48s]  Actually, wait. I want to go down here because I feel like I missed something in here. No,
[15399.48s -> 15417.42s]  it's the next room. Okay. All right. So if I go up here, I think I just get back up. I don't really
[15417.42s -> 15431.80s]  need to do that again, do I? Go back up. Nothing else? You're like a hamster running around.
[15431.88s -> 15470.76s]  Yeah. Yeah. Wait, did I not? Wait a minute. I didn't go over here. A yellow diamond. Nice.
[15477.14s -> 15484.22s]  This must be the collection room. Blue butterfly.
[15484.22s -> 15495.80s]  Blue butterfly. The collection master is a tacky and lousy boss. He leaves all the dissections
[15495.80s -> 15503.13s]  for me to do, even if he does not bother to come here. All he does is up at his three favorite
[15503.13s -> 15508.23s]  specimens in a particular order before leaving. There's nothing special about them in any way.
[15508.31s -> 15515.80s]  Well, only look at those three specimens. Mr. Wonderful. When we pay attention, don't act like
[15515.80s -> 15529.46s]  a fucking joker. It's a puzzle. Pay attention. All right. Order. Okay. So the butterflies have
[15529.46s -> 15535.66s]  to be in a certain order. We're on emote only. Yeah. I don't think that will happen again,
[15535.66s -> 15547.46s]  if I will be honest with you. Good to know. Okay. So sort of put their hands on this thing.
[15550.33s -> 15563.64s]  Skulls. Oh, bugs. Bugs and geodes. This is like my favorite room. Anything else I can interact
[15563.64s -> 15573.72s]  with? The shoes, right? So what did you do? You touched a beetle. Then you touched this head.
[15578.12s -> 15584.76s]  And I think that's it. You also went over here and you touched salamander, whatever that is.
[15585.32s -> 15608.39s]  No matter what order. All right. What are the options? It's butterfly, head, beetle, alligator,
[15608.39s -> 15615.11s]  beetle, snake, butterfly, head, beetle. All right. There's two different beetles.
[15620.23s -> 15627.88s]  You put your hands all over this thing. What kind of beetle is it? It's a beetle that's going like
[15627.88s -> 15659.00s]  this. Okay. Does it matter the order? Probably. Would you eat any of the bugs? No, of course not.
[15659.00s -> 15683.16s]  Well, I guess where do they start? Started here. You went beetle, beetle, skull, beetle, skull,
[15683.16s -> 15692.25s]  salamander. Okay. There it is. There you go. Okay. Good. Give me that butterfly.
[15692.25s -> 15718.33s]  You got everything you need, but exactly what you want. Well, that's not good. The parasite
[15718.33s -> 15725.91s]  is reacting to the ember. So that's the ember. That looks like something Wesker would want.
[15726.55s -> 15766.39s]  Give me a case. This will knock out the parasite, but only for a time. You ready?
[15775.66s -> 15780.82s]  Kind of looks like a grimace shape. Just remember, it's not a cure. We still need
[15780.82s -> 15806.50s]  to find a way to get that thing out of you. This guy again. I don't understand. It should
[15806.50s -> 15814.55s]  be working by now. Take the ember and go. Once the parasite is sedated, you can give me back
[15814.55s -> 15821.27s]  that damn stone. I can't leave you here. Not like this. Spare me. I'll be fine. You got another
[15821.27s -> 15836.28s]  promise to keep. Right. But you come find me as soon as you're done here. Okay. Well, round three.
[15836.28s -> 15880.58s]  Do I have any ammo? Oh, no. I'm just going. Okay. She's cured. I should have peed. I have to pee.
[15923.24s -> 15935.99s]  I'm just rocking around. Okay. I'm going to pee. I'll be right back. Maybe this might be
[15937.03s -> 16233.43s]  one more break after this. We'll see. I'm just going to go. Be right back. I have returned.
[16234.15s -> 16243.24s]  He must be going through some shit in there. Yeah, I was going through some shit in the bathroom.
[16256.33s -> 16276.54s]  Uh, wait, where's my headphones? Why are you pouring tea in the toilet? That is a good question
[16276.54s -> 16284.09s]  because I got a good answer for you. When I, I used to talk about tea all the time. I used to
[16284.09s -> 16296.36s]  drink tea all the time. I still do sometimes, but that's a, it's like a 2017, 2016, uh, lore.
[16296.36s -> 16300.95s]  And also people used to say that they could hear me peeing into the toilet every time I went to
[16300.95s -> 16314.62s]  the bathroom. So kind of a combination of a few things. All right, let's get back to it. Are we
[16314.62s -> 16338.31s]  ready? Chapter five. Yeah. Loud pee. Yeah, that's what it was. Okay. Make sure you get the stuff.
[16343.82s -> 16360.10s]  No stuff. Louise's footprints must've gone this way. It's handprints. All right. So I get it.
[16360.10s -> 16378.25s]  So that's a, what is it? A moon? So here's a sun. Okay. Moons are open. Is that? Oh,
[16378.25s -> 16393.83s]  it's just a locked door. Okay. Okay. Moons are open. Let me check over here. Wait,
[16406.52s -> 16430.66s]  sun needs to be opened. Chronicles of pursuit. Okay. Continue with my current method to change
[16430.66s -> 16446.31s]  nothing, but instead widen my search. My microphone needs to be closer. Okay. What
[16446.31s -> 16450.39s]  color is each subject? We know green is always science, but what's red, blue, et cetera.
[16453.98s -> 16465.93s]  Hmm. To me, red is math, right? Just like, Oh man, it's math. What about like social studies
[16466.01s -> 16479.91s]  is still social studies is blue. I think math is blue. Hmm. Yeah. No red. Now red is math.
[16482.25s -> 16498.55s]  Science is green. Yeah, for sure. Making sure I don't miss it. This is open now. Okay. So now I
[16498.55s -> 16509.46s]  can open this and go down English. You know, math might actually be yellow and English might be blue.
[16516.90s -> 16528.42s]  That's tough. You're demented for that. I it's tough though, because I don't know. It's a good
[16528.42s -> 16554.57s]  question. Okay. So, uh, I need this to be a moon. It's not a moon. I can't go anywhere else. Hmm.
[16554.57s -> 16564.92s]  Okay. Wait, there's nothing else I can do up here. Right? Yeah. This is a, this is a, this is a moon
[16565.88s -> 16582.33s]  that I haven't read the first time. Fight chat fight. Um, green might not always be science.
[16582.33s -> 16590.94s]  Science might be blue because of like, I don't know, water like, Ooh, like Marine life. Does
[16590.94s -> 16601.26s]  that make sense? If a green could also be now. Yeah, you're right. Green is always science. No
[16601.26s -> 16606.90s]  matter what. I think that's a given. Okay. Hold on. I got, I got to play the video again. I just
[16606.90s -> 16634.09s]  walked up and down the same set of stairs three times. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Can I shoot it up there?
[16634.81s -> 16654.92s]  I can't. So this has to be a sun. So I have to jump across and just, okay. So hold on.
[16663.26s -> 16673.94s]  Can I go across, but that's not, wait, hold on. I want to, I want to screw this up.
[16674.58s -> 16682.79s]  Do I have it? I have it right now. I think I do. Cause then I pull it one more time and then
[16683.59s -> 16688.23s]  down here, I'll pull it and it'll be back to normal. I think, right. You guys still fight
[16688.23s -> 16694.62s]  to both the subjects. Uh, okay. French is what color is math? Red. A lot of people said radio
[16699.45s -> 16705.46s]  math is white. Blue is math because it's cold and logical. Green is science because plants and
[16705.46s -> 16729.42s]  chlorophyll. Hold on. Let me, I got to read this. Oh, hold on. I got deleted. Yeah. Green is always
[16729.42s -> 16753.45s]  science about orange. What would be red besides math? I'm going to leave that up for now. Social
[16753.45s -> 16765.67s]  studies is orange. Yeah. That's that. That does seem pretty, that seems pretty accurate. I'd kind
[16765.67s -> 16785.19s]  of have to look at it. I would need to have the colors in the notebooks. Red is health. White
[16785.19s -> 16800.06s]  could be health too. So could red. Red could be health or blood. Down we go. Green is health. Oh,
[16800.06s -> 16811.98s]  I don't know. I think green is always science. What is this? I'll leave some signs to point you
[16811.98s -> 16818.30s]  in the right direction. Okay. He really knows his way around this place. Treasure over here.
[16818.86s -> 16847.78s]  Red is good for electives. Yeah. I'm thinking white would be, I think English is blue.
[16848.98s -> 16864.46s]  English is blue. Health is white or red. Math is red or orange. Science is green.
[16865.26s -> 16873.08s]  What about gym? Well, Jim, you don't like, you don't like study in gym in a notebook.
[16878.33s -> 16898.23s]  Jim, hope it's not a sign of things to come. Oh, not these fucking things. Okay. I'll get it there.
[16898.87s -> 16950.22s]  Move. What about wizard class? Uh, what about purple? I feel like purple is too
[16951.18s -> 16958.36s]  cool of a color to be a subject. Does that make any sense? It's too hip, I think, to be a subject.
[16959.16s -> 16988.76s]  It won't open. Not swimming in that. Math is purple. Let's keep doing this. Purple's for the
[16988.76s -> 17003.74s]  dark arts. Shit. Okay. Hold on. What's on the other door? Splish splash. Yeah. We're doing this.
[17003.74s -> 17029.86s]  Maybe not. Can I not go in there? You died very quickly. Purple is for purple alien. That's right.
[17033.13s -> 17036.17s]  You catch sight of the giant shadow moving through the water. Looks like
[17036.81s -> 17042.17s]  Gregorio's waterway has a lord reigning over its murky channels. Find out what it is and catch it
[17042.17s -> 17060.52s]  for me. Lord of the waterway. That sounds fun. In the water? That scared the shit out of me. Oh my
[17060.52s -> 17071.62s]  God. Why? I thought it was, I thought it grabbed me. I thought it was still alive and grabbed my
[17071.62s -> 17094.42s]  leg or something. Waterway. Cool. Okay. Seven. You've proven yourself reliable. Got some rare
[17094.42s -> 17102.89s]  things on sale, stranger. He's killing me. Why is this small key two and this small key six?
[17104.17s -> 17121.86s]  What's up with this scam here? That's kind of a scam. I think one of the cheap ones.
[17122.02s -> 17132.44s]  Wise choice. I know green herbs, red herbs. I mean, this thing's cool.
[17135.13s -> 17141.62s]  You can't go wrong with that. That'd be all pleasant. Oh my God. This is a mess.
[17145.14s -> 17160.84s]  Ooh, I got three blues. Go. Hey, I need all two purples. Hey, two math glasses.
[17161.48s -> 17181.19s]  And then I need blue, purple and gray. I can buy them. Can I welcome came into some other bits
[17181.19s -> 17191.64s]  in Bob's two names. Good instinct. Stranger. This ain't a charity. Why is he screaming at me? I'll
[17191.64s -> 17221.27s]  keep a lookout. I mean that it's, I could, I could do it. Although I don't, I should do every color.
[17221.35s -> 17233.14s]  That's for a hundred K. Yeah. I'll sell the other ones or wait. I got purple, green,
[17233.14s -> 17261.24s]  red. Hold on a second. Purple, red, green, blue, yellow. Ah, and I can say I'll save these.
[17261.24s -> 17267.18s]  Actually, you know what? I don't need to have to be double make the money. Only two chapters left.
[17267.82s -> 17284.55s]  As we'll just do it. I have a lot of money now for items that welcome burger King Barry
[17285.43s -> 17296.50s]  140,000. I got a lot of money now. This is an insane amount of money.
[17299.29s -> 17307.34s]  Thank you. So what now? I power. Ooh, stingray. What is that? A rifle? You'll get some bang for
[17307.42s -> 17320.28s]  your buck. I T a well-tuned increased power by one and a half times. Oh shit.
[17324.49s -> 17331.43s]  We're starting to get an idea of yours. You've exhausted our normal range of services. This
[17331.43s -> 17337.91s]  thing is unbeatable now. If you're interested in something, okay. 60,000. You catch my drift.
[17337.91s -> 17345.66s]  Should I just go for it? Your weapons. I need to do. I need a ticket. I think I need to see.
[17352.01s -> 17361.03s]  Oh, let us know when you've made some room. Okay. I have, what are you? What is happening?
[17364.12s -> 17392.66s]  What the hell are you doing? Docking up while you come back. Just make it all. Just make a ton
[17392.66s -> 17409.00s]  of machine gun ammo. Okay. That's pretty good. What do I got now? I don't eat the fish who heals
[17409.64s -> 17419.93s]  a bunch of ammo. Well, I've got something new for you. Ruby's all rubbish. She makes no difference.
[17419.93s -> 17426.92s]  I don't want to do that. Wait, is this an outfit charm? Oh, I thought that was an,
[17426.92s -> 17433.40s]  a new ADA outfit. I was like, Oh wait, this is a new outfit. Then we can talk.
[17435.72s -> 17439.96s]  You don't need to take it. Yeah. I don't want to be just completely broke though.
[17440.04s -> 17447.96s]  Got something new for you, but whatever you do, it won't do you much good. A deal. Well struck.
[17452.07s -> 17459.83s]  The thing is disgusting. It's a veritable work of art. Will that be all then? I think that's all
[17459.83s -> 17480.12s]  I want to do. Yes. Thank you. Do check out 70 shots. So we read the charm description. Well,
[17480.76s -> 17486.28s]  came into some other bits and bobs to rip shields away from certain enemies using the grapple gun.
[17486.28s -> 17493.61s]  That's great. He's killing me next time. Okay. Well this is what I need. So I'm good. All right.
[17493.61s -> 17499.53s]  Now let's fight the giant monster in the water. Imagine it's just, it's just right here. Let's
[17499.53s -> 17522.02s]  kill this thing. Can I get down there? No. Okay. Let's go. So where is progress now down? You know
[17522.02s -> 17536.57s]  what? I'm going to open that. I have a key. You know, pop it open every time it explodes. I think
[17536.57s -> 17594.73s]  it grabs me. You dick. You die in the water. Shit. What chair does he have? Probably some CEO chair,
[17594.73s -> 17615.34s]  like Herman Miller or something. This is a breastfeeding chair. This is it. This is a
[17615.34s -> 17630.30s]  nursing chair. And I wish I I'm not making that up. This is a nursing chair, but it was perfect.
[17630.30s -> 17647.27s]  And I had to have it. It was fucking perfect. It's just like, this thing is great. It's,
[17647.27s -> 17661.43s]  it works well. It can be a regular chair. It's just a chair. Who cares? Congrats.
[17672.57s -> 17694.73s]  Ooh, wait, I can fight the thing. I got a gold bar. I want to fight the thing.
[17697.96s -> 17703.21s]  Okay. Wait, you have new stuff. What do you mean?
[17705.38s -> 17710.66s]  Got some rare things on sale, stranger. A deal well struck.
[17711.78s -> 17713.22s]  Oh, you already had this. You had this.
[17713.22s -> 17716.02s]  What can I do you for? Don't get yourself killed.
[17723.43s -> 17734.68s]  Oh, chat. Is chat taking it too far? Is chat taking it too far? Settle down. It's a chair.
[17737.66s -> 17743.00s]  It's a funny little thing, but relax. Don't have to take it too far.
[17743.80s -> 17754.28s]  I agree, but we can all agree. It's a, it's a slightly humorous thing. Don't be weird about it.
[17754.84s -> 17776.09s]  Or you're going to get fucking zapped. Okay. My God. Is that him? Right? Is it,
[17776.09s -> 17842.44s]  this is the, is this the big guy? Oh shit. Where's the big guy? Wait, where's this diamond?
[17842.44s -> 17853.62s]  I don't see it. That's gross. Don't make me regret saying that. It's funny, but come on guys,
[17853.62s -> 17889.02s]  relax. Don't make it weird. Don't make it weird. What made you choose this chair over the others?
[17891.35s -> 17898.26s]  Okay. Here's the next part of this, which is why it's funny. It's one of the only chairs
[17898.26s -> 17911.77s]  at target. There are two chairs at target. This is one of them. They may be more,
[17911.77s -> 17929.96s]  there may be one to three chairs in your target. It's the target chair. I love target. Yeah.
[17931.14s -> 17936.39s]  Uh, it's also temporary. So, uh, I think I said at the beginning of the stream that
[17936.39s -> 17944.36s]  that's a big one right there. Yep. Uh, I'm getting a different chair to be here.
[17945.08s -> 17949.74s]  This is very temporary. Uh, and I'm just going to use it as a regular chair after
[17950.46s -> 17969.42s]  the other chair is just not here. It will be soon. You're going to betray this recliner.
[17969.42s -> 17971.98s]  It's actually, believe it or not, this is actually pretty comfortable.
[17972.54s -> 17982.63s]  I like it. It's just like, it doesn't, it just rocks. Uh, I want to turn that in.
[18018.58s -> 18019.46s]  What should I get now?
[18027.06s -> 18033.37s]  I think, I think I just saved my money. Is the charm of the charms worth it?
[18035.70s -> 18054.04s]  Actually it, yeah, it definitely is. Yeah. It's only five. Hard to find a nice desk chair these
[18054.04s -> 18058.92s]  days. And those gaming chairs are actually the most uncomfortable. This nursing, whatever,
[18058.92s -> 18065.08s]  like baby chair, whatever this actually is. Uh, it's just a great chair and use it for whatever
[18065.08s -> 18071.50s]  you want. Like me, you, it's, it actually is crazy. Let's get, let's get real for a second.
[18073.38s -> 18078.02s]  Finding furniture that I did when you just want like a small thing to sit in,
[18078.02s -> 18082.58s]  just like a little thing. It's kind of hard to find something like this. This kind of stuff
[18082.58s -> 18090.42s]  doesn't really exist. It's either like a giant fucking huge thing or it's part of a big couch
[18090.42s -> 18094.98s]  or it's a curved up here. It's made out of materially. It's just, it's just uncomfortable.
[18095.54s -> 18102.33s]  And it's, it's, somebody just said it's really expensive. So I, this is exactly what I wanted
[18102.33s -> 18112.50s]  it for. Everything is huge now. Yeah. And now is it like the best chair in the world? No. I mean,
[18113.46s -> 18118.98s]  I want to say this was, I mean, it wasn't cheap, cheap, cheap. I mean, it was still,
[18118.98s -> 18121.30s]  it was like, I think a couple hundred bucks, a hundred something bucks, I think.
[18123.22s -> 18127.78s]  But you get a chair that's like a nice chair like this. You might have to spend 500 to a thousand
[18127.78s -> 18134.97s]  dollars, which is, I just, I got one coming. That's going to be a little bit better, but
[18139.96s -> 18149.48s]  yeah. Some of these chairs are like over five plus a hundred thousand, 100, 100, not 100,000,
[18149.48s -> 18158.38s]  5,000 to like, I've seen chairs that are 5,000. You know, those big, they almost look like,
[18158.38s -> 18162.14s]  okay. You know, the chairs look like cigars. They look like gigantic cigars. It's all like
[18162.14s -> 18172.14s]  the only way I can describe it. The cigar chair. It's like this high off the ground and this wide.
[18172.14s -> 18178.15s]  And it looks like a cigar. Those things are more than one to $2,000 at least.
[18178.79s -> 18180.73s]  Yeah. The Mr. Green's chair. Exactly.
[18191.58s -> 18194.22s]  I think I don't need to, is there any more? There's an upgrade.
[18197.54s -> 18217.08s]  I'll do it later. Okay. So I can pull shields away now, but yeah, I want to say I'll be in
[18217.08s -> 18222.46s]  this chair for the next few streams, maybe the next two or three streams, but I did,
[18222.46s -> 18226.14s]  there is another one that I want, that I want to get. That's a little more elaborate.
[18226.14s -> 18231.82s]  That will help with my legs, but this is going to just kind of sit in the corner over here and
[18231.82s -> 18237.90s]  just be a chair. So this whole setup is temporary. You'll see some changes in the next few weeks.
[18239.11s -> 18257.27s]  I'm excited for it. Auto can sleep in it. Yeah. This would, this would be like a nice
[18257.27s -> 18261.51s]  little auto chair probably. Although it'd be hard for him to get up on top of it.
[18262.23s -> 18271.11s]  It'd be hard for him to get in and lie down on it. I'd have to pick him up and he might be able
[18271.11s -> 18285.85s]  to sit with me in the other one. That'd be kind of cute. Is he doing all right? Yeah, he's doing
[18285.85s -> 18294.31s]  great. He's doing wonderful. Oh, you bet. You better believe there'll be, I'll be hanging out
[18294.31s -> 18297.51s]  here with him sitting either right on my lap or right because the other chair I'm getting is a
[18297.51s -> 18306.34s]  lot bigger. They'd be right in the face. It's not quite a cigar chair, but it's a little bit wider
[18306.34s -> 18334.10s]  than this one. Well, I got the treasure I wanted. Where is it? Oh, it's hanging. Alrighty. We need
[18334.10s -> 18355.67s]  to go down there. Wait, I could climb up. Yeah. Wait a minute. Is it worth getting down and is
[18355.67s -> 18361.13s]  that open? I need a red robe. I actually thought about streaming with a robot and that'd be fun.
[18361.77s -> 18369.48s]  Shit. I can't open this. Okay. I gotta, I gotta lock in here. How did I even get back up here?
[18369.48s -> 18388.38s]  I'm just kind of talking. All right. I want to go this way. Yeah. You look like Hugh Hefner.
[18389.10s -> 18417.75s]  Please do one grapple melee. Yeah. I don't know. If it's just melee from a distance,
[18417.75s -> 18420.55s]  it doesn't seem to be working unless it's a different button combination that I'm not doing.
[18421.67s -> 18439.02s]  Where are you? You're gonna make me eat my egg or my fish or whatever it is.
[18439.58s -> 18459.32s]  You need to be far away and then hit it. I'll try it again, but I feel like I've been
[18460.12s -> 18483.56s]  too far away almost. Can I sneak in here? Remember guys, if there's not a button on the screen,
[18483.56s -> 18487.40s]  he can't see it and he won't know. Well, that's not true because even if there is a button on the
[18487.40s -> 18494.38s]  screen that says rotate with Q and E, I apparently won't see that either. So I'm kind of just lost
[18494.38s -> 18514.66s]  regardless. So I don't know if I can be helped. Oh, I'm so concerned about that person.
[18517.70s -> 18525.27s]  Holy shit. That was cool. That dude over there. That wasn't that far. That wasn't far away.
[18528.87s -> 18534.60s]  This person over here is, how are they still confused? Why are they not breaking out?
[18556.26s -> 18588.60s]  Oh, thank God. He took like two. Yeah. Why did he die so quickly? He died incredibly fast.
[18588.60s -> 18612.84s]  Was it the flashbang? The gun is just so upgraded. Then I'm start using it more often.
[18612.84s -> 18655.22s]  Did I get everything? Maybe. Make some more ammo. I think I can do it. Yeah. He just melted when I
[18655.22s -> 18676.07s]  shot him with this like two times. That was awesome. I think it's filthy. Use the charm for
[18676.07s -> 18703.14s]  extra SMG ammo. I think I have it on. Isn't it on? I think that's it right there. Cool chair.
[18703.14s -> 18711.78s]  It is a cool chair. It doesn't matter where it's from. It's a cool chair. 35,000. All right. What
[18711.78s -> 18716.41s]  do I want to do here? I want that. So I'm going to sell. Oh, well, there you go.
[18717.05s -> 18732.42s]  A deal well struck. Fool stranger. Melee crit. That sounds good. Now going for some mayhem,
[18732.42s -> 18738.82s]  eh? What if it is from target? Yeah, it doesn't matter. Chair is a chair. And if it's a decent
[18738.82s -> 18747.06s]  chair, it's a decent chair. Honestly, even when the new chair, when I get the new one,
[18747.94s -> 18751.93s]  who knows? I might sit in the new one and go, put me back in the other one.
[18754.49s -> 18757.37s]  It's what if it's not the same? What if I really just like this one?
[18758.01s -> 18772.71s]  Here's the second. We possibly save it again. Current one looks comfy. It is. It just does
[18772.71s -> 18781.34s]  exactly what I want it to do. Be a chair that can swivel. It can rock. It's fairly comfortable.
[18781.98s -> 18787.90s]  I will. Okay. I will say the material, this material is a little grainy. It's a little
[18787.90s -> 18806.90s]  rough, but it's not bad. It's fine. It's comfortable. No foot rest. No.
[18809.66s -> 18846.04s]  What is a man without his baby chair? True. It's a real man-sized chair. Let's kill this
[18846.04s -> 18862.66s]  guy once and for all. Definitely got him. What? The thing crashed from the ceiling,
[18862.66s -> 18867.30s]  landed right on his head. It didn't kill him? That would have killed any man or living being
[18867.30s -> 18935.51s]  or thing. Oh God. Oh, let go. Let go. Let go. Oh, not yet. Okay. Now I take it. Oh, that hurts.
[18945.54s -> 18950.42s]  This gun is so unbelievable. I could make the difficulty harder if I wanted to.
[18951.82s -> 18986.38s]  Holy shit. This thing is maxed out. Well, I'm still going to use it. Give me all the
[18986.38s -> 19005.02s]  stuff first before I lose access to all of it. You got to shoot it in the, in the orange goo.
[19005.02s -> 19083.67s]  Ouch. I think I got all the stuff. Oh, okay. This would be it. Almost out of bullets. One more time
[19083.67s -> 19135.80s]  maybe. Yeah, that's it. I thought I got, oh, that cure does not work currently. Don't tell me I'm
[19135.80s -> 19145.80s]  not good at a game when I did. Look what I just did. That's like one, two, three. Like, holy shit,
[19145.80s -> 19152.68s]  dude. Yeah. I mean, I'm seeing like a lot of people saying like, holy shit. I actually like,
[19152.68s -> 19157.91s]  I had it wrong. He's like really fucking good. I, sometimes I like to prove people wrong.
[19183.90s -> 19191.14s]  I like this area. The amber Louise, where is it? He's weird. Mushrooms.
[19191.14s -> 19228.12s]  Ada does not give a, Ada does not give a heck. Yeah, I know. It's part of her character.
[19228.12s -> 19250.97s]  Close one. Yeah. Thanks for that. You guys keeping me honest for it. I don't want to say
[19254.25s -> 19256.41s]  right. I don't want to say that.
[19256.97s -> 19303.85s]  Yeah. No, I'm just, I didn't say anything. Mom, are you reading chat Leon? There's only time to
[19303.85s -> 19311.51s]  say this once. They said it was a joke. If you hurry. Wait, if my mom was watching, wouldn't
[19311.51s -> 19340.04s]  she see the face cam? She would see the face cam. Sorry, ma. Okay. Uh, one or what? Two chapters
[19340.04s -> 19347.35s]  left. Okay. The last chapter is probably a runaway from the big, scary monster. So there's
[19347.35s -> 19366.90s]  probably one real chapter remaining, but it's all good. I'm ready to go. Let's do it. I would,
[19366.90s -> 19409.02s]  that was really lazy. I just needed to walk two more steps. That was okay. Storm trooper aim. I
[19409.02s -> 19439.69s]  got it in two hits. All right. Wait a minute. Trying to do the grapple hook thing. End up
[19439.69s -> 19461.66s]  running at them and not far enough. Really? How do you stagger from that far away? Okay. Well,
[19461.66s -> 19469.62s]  I have to get down there fast. Can I grapple hook down there? I'm just gonna wait for them to get
[19469.62s -> 19500.49s]  up here. Let's kill them. Then go grapple gun, melee attack type. Why is this showing me a
[19500.49s -> 19530.07s]  controller? But it's an F already bound to cause I changed the controls to have. Okay. So here's
[19530.07s -> 19535.99s]  what's happening. So I rebound my melee to thumb button. I thought it was telling me just to hit
[19535.99s -> 19542.78s]  the melee button, not F like, Oh, Hey, hit F, but also hit thumb button because that's what you
[19542.78s -> 19552.06s]  haven't found to because sometimes it like changes. Yeah. Okay. Well it's a, I thought they were the
[19552.06s -> 19573.02s]  same button. Okay. Let's go now. Turn it again. I collected the money. Yeah. For some reason I
[19573.02s -> 19580.14s]  thought it was just melee from far away. And even though I did see F, F to me was the same
[19580.70s -> 19590.09s]  binding of the same key, which is thumb button. So that's on me. I don't even need it.
[19597.90s -> 19598.94s]  What do I do with my money now?
[19612.86s -> 19625.08s]  I think I was going to buy gunpowder because come on, I'll buy gunpowder.
[19625.48s -> 19638.33s]  And soon. Well, it's good work. If I do say so myself, I can do that too.
[19639.13s -> 19651.70s]  A deal. Well struck. Uh, attack speed by one and a half times for the knife tuned weapon can make
[19651.70s -> 19661.78s]  up for a lack of skill friend dazzled. I like durability more. Our craftsmanship demands.
[19662.42s -> 19671.16s]  Ruby's all rubbish. It makes no difference. The price is going to be for generators.
[19671.16s -> 19685.46s]  So I'm going to keep the scope. There's some things money. An interesting choice.
[19685.46s -> 19702.06s]  I'll keep a lookout as well. All right. Welcome stranger. What can I do you for a deal? Well,
[19703.02s -> 19713.64s]  Hey, there you are. Hey, older Billy on the knife. Thank you. Equip your charm.
[19714.20s -> 19728.79s]  Didn't I? I think I had it right. Do check out my welcome. Life needs care every once in a while.
[19732.84s -> 19744.82s]  It's not on there. Welcome. Isn't that it right there? Where's that screen to equip stuff?
[19745.46s -> 19761.94s]  Like, how do I get to that menu screen? Oh, it's typewriter beat three novice star doors,
[19762.66s -> 19795.14s]  giant insects. I'll try. Yeah, that's on Nova star doors. It was a really bad dry. I'll say,
[19799.19s -> 19835.42s]  okay. This way. And then treasure. And then down that way. Don't be spotted. I upgraded the knife.
[19835.42s -> 19876.17s]  Might as well use it. Saved ammo. All right, let's try it. How do I do it? Got it. Treasure
[19876.25s -> 19930.31s]  is straight through here. Cool. Backflip flip. Cool. Flip. You suck. Oh shit. I ain't dealing
[19930.31s -> 19959.08s]  with that. Treasure up there. I'm going to play Starfield. I couldn't really get into it. I was
[19959.08s -> 19968.74s]  never a big Bethesda game player. Didn't really get into it. All right, we're down. And then,
[19968.74s -> 19986.30s]  okay, let's do this first. Although to be fair though, I never really loved games where
[19987.50s -> 19993.03s]  it's just a lot of dialogue options and dialogue options that really just it's,
[19993.03s -> 19999.05s]  Hey, here's like four things. You can just talk to this person. I never was a big fan of it.
[20000.81s -> 20009.16s]  It always kind of just leads to the same thing. Now Baldur's Gate has dialogue options, but
[20010.20s -> 20015.32s]  I feel like I'm invested in my character a little more somehow. I feel like it actually means
[20015.32s -> 20019.24s]  things. And somebody just said sorcery too, but a lot of stuff you do in sorcery, like has immediate
[20019.24s -> 20024.94s]  consequences. I feel like a lot of times in the games where you pick a lot of dialogue options,
[20024.94s -> 20028.94s]  it's just like, Hey, you can kind of talk to this person however you want. It doesn't really
[20028.94s -> 20032.70s]  necessarily matter too much, but like you can just have a conversation in the way that you would want
[20032.70s -> 20050.62s]  to. Like that's cool, but never really did it for me. Except one randomly will insult them. Yeah.
[20050.62s -> 20057.66s]  All right. I am going to get crushed by one of these and I'm not careful. I didn't get the
[20057.66s -> 20072.92s]  treasure. Did I miss my opportunity to get it? I don't think I can get back up. Oh, there it is.
[20076.74s -> 20089.34s]  Dialogue actually matters in Baldur's Gate 3. Oh yeah, it really does. Baldur's Gate,
[20089.34s -> 20098.98s]  the consequences are like sorcery. And obviously my attention span is pretty low already. So if
[20098.98s -> 20106.98s]  there's not immediate stakes on something, I kind of lose interest, which is like, Hey, talk to this
[20106.98s -> 20111.54s]  person. You need to go figure this out. It's like, Oh, okay, cool. And it's like, Oh, by the way,
[20111.54s -> 20115.98s]  you're gonna, you can sit here for a while and just talk. It doesn't really mean anything,
[20115.98s -> 20150.63s]  but you can do it. I always just skip it completely. You piece of shit. Where is it?
[20151.27s -> 20173.50s]  Oh, it's right there. I thought I was not even close guys. I thought I was naughty. I thought
[20173.50s -> 20182.33s]  I was in a perfect safe zone. Holy shit. I may have dumped my pants a little. I think I may have
[20182.33s -> 20197.16s]  dumped the chair. Okay. What the hell? Now I got to go all the way around. He's having another
[20197.16s -> 20207.13s]  brownout. Just don't, don't use any of these for thumbnails. I know you want to. Don't use
[20207.13s -> 20239.86s]  something else. Use me going like this. Okay. Try it again. Yeah, it sucks. It's a long run,
[20239.86s -> 20245.24s]  isn't it? Yeah. I feel, I can hear you're out of breath. Don't have the strength to attack,
[20245.24s -> 20269.00s]  do you? I was going to give you a minute. It's a long ass run. Now go back the way we came.
[20269.00s -> 20299.14s]  I can actually go up here, can't I? Let's not make the same mistake twice. I made the same
[20299.14s -> 20331.18s]  mistake twice. If those of you keeping score at home on your scoreboard, we're good. Who shot that?
[20343.56s -> 20367.61s]  Do it. And you missed completely. And now you got your leg hit. What was that all about? I got a
[20367.61s -> 20391.46s]  lot of herbs. I don't actually stop using my, um, my rifle because of the generators. How do I pull
[20391.46s -> 20442.58s]  it off? It looked like I had it. There we go. You're alive. I thought you were dead. Okay. Now
[20442.58s -> 20502.82s]  what? Into the ancient Chantry. I hear, I hear Laurel, to be honest. Do not shoot that. Grapple
[20502.82s -> 20506.58s]  melee doesn't make any sense. Why wouldn't they just come towards the player? Kind of like a
[20506.58s -> 20516.82s]  scorpion. Yeah. Well, I think, yeah. Unless they weigh a thousand pounds. It's just so unrealistic.
[20517.86s -> 20546.31s]  I'm surprised we're still in chapter five. I figured we would've got out of it by now.
[20563.06s -> 20567.78s]  Somebody told Leon that that hat gives him like plus 20% speed. And they were just lying to him.
[20568.34s -> 20594.47s]  That's the only reason why he's got it on. And Mr. Kennedy, why do you have that stupid hat on?
[20595.03s -> 20600.81s]  I don't think it's stupid, but it's stupid for the occasion. You're an idiot. It gives me plus
[20600.81s -> 20623.06s]  5% damage. Krauser has possession of the Amber. Don't ever do that voice again. Keep the client
[20623.06s -> 20677.91s]  happy. Sorry. Oh, do you? Okay. There's a show that is a scorn like, have you guys ever seen
[20677.91s -> 20687.72s]  Ballmasters Adult Swim? They do the scorn randomly throughout that show. You just hear
[20688.60s -> 20695.96s]  Ballmasters. They'll be in the middle of a game and it's like, Oh, big play happens. Ballmasters.
[20696.84s -> 20702.95s]  It's they do scorn. I was like, Holy shit. That's awesome. They actually,
[20702.95s -> 20710.52s]  it's actually a scorn. Like I've been waiting for somebody to do that for years. And I guess
[20710.52s -> 20720.36s]  somebody did it. That's a crazy show, by the way. That show is very alive. There's a lot happening
[20720.36s -> 20772.39s]  in that show. You didn't even play scorn. You smoking crack? Stop it. This is a great setup.
[20777.69s -> 20784.36s]  A motorcycle. It's a boat, dude. I need to eat a fucking jar of peanut butter after this. I thought
[20784.36s -> 20797.02s]  he took off on a motorcycle. God. I just hear like, Oh dude, cool. I want to see what like
[20797.02s -> 20819.94s]  fucking sick variety he's got. Looking for something? Chapter complete. Why peanut butter?
[20819.94s -> 20842.33s]  It's got protein and good fats and all that stuff. Peanut butter or hummus. Eat them both.
[20843.21s -> 20855.77s]  Not at the same time, but the hat flies off and he's just like, Oh shit. You look like you've got
[20855.85s -> 20862.49s]  something to say. I have something to ask you, but I don't think I'll get a straight answer.
[20863.29s -> 20871.93s]  Fucking stinks in that hat. Just telling you. Raccoon City. He's been wearing it for like six
[20871.93s -> 20881.38s]  days. The world changed. You try to save one person, a hundred others die. I guess I changed
[20881.38s -> 20901.06s]  too. You? Leon S. Kennedy. You haven't changed. You just think you have. So here's my question.
[20903.91s -> 20915.21s]  Have you changed Ada or are you just trying to use me again? What do you think? We're here.
[20920.07s -> 20932.97s]  Don't think too hard, handsome. See you later. Story of my life. All right. See you later,
[20932.97s -> 20954.02s]  Leon. Look at the improv show. You're about to go act in. Good one. Yes. Yes. That was a good
[20954.02s -> 20977.53s]  one. I think it was too. That one stinks. What's your opinion? I don't even have this rifle.
[20978.09s -> 20985.74s]  Whose blood are you here for this time? Mine or Sadler's? That all depends on you.
[20985.74s -> 20992.46s]  That's a sick weapon too. I don't even have it. Change of plans. Of course.
[20993.67s -> 21000.60s]  I wish I could put them all in that fucking hat. Friend's going to be enough. Interesting.
[21005.26s -> 21015.18s]  Okay. I'll do it. But cost you extra. Wise decision. Send you the new coordinates.
[21016.14s -> 21024.01s]  And remember, I do not like waiting. I know. I was going to say dialogue options.
[21024.57s -> 21043.43s]  So just get right to the point. God damn it. I've got a ways to go.
[21049.88s -> 21085.67s]  Head for the comms facility. Okay. So this is the island, right? Yeah. Okay. Treasures. Nice.
[21096.60s -> 21110.89s]  That just opened. Okay. You don't have to fight. Oh, Leon fights him, right? Crystal ore.
[21111.61s -> 21163.32s]  Stab him. Stab him. Stab him. Stab him. Why are you reloading the guns? Too close. We're good.
[21163.32s -> 21170.78s]  You're going to S plus all characters on perks? Uh, no, I did S plus on a few places and a few
[21170.78s -> 21176.46s]  people. Um, I wouldn't do that tonight though. I'm going to get to the end of the game and probably
[21176.46s -> 21184.76s]  call it. And then I think Monday is the next time I'm going to be streaming. Monday I might be in a
[21184.76s -> 21190.78s]  new setup. Well, an upgraded version of the one you see right now. I want to play party animals
[21190.78s -> 21197.02s]  again. I think stir wants to play it too. I also asked Vinny if he wanted to play as well. So we'll
[21197.02s -> 21229.21s]  probably get a crew together, play a little bit of party animals. That's fun. Well, okay. Did I
[21229.21s -> 21247.83s]  get everything from this room? No, there is a treasure hanging right here. Oh, I missed the
[21247.83s -> 21258.50s]  amp. Oh, whatever. Be just up ahead, but getting through won't be Ada and Wesker were added to
[21258.50s -> 21274.12s]  marks. Ooh, Wesker was fun. Wesker was a Magnum, right? Welcome came into some other bits and bobs
[21274.12s -> 21283.53s]  too. Why not try your hand running speed? That's kind of cold. All right. Do I, I think I want
[21283.53s -> 21294.50s]  flash grenades. Flash grenades are the best from what I remember, especially in the end, or should
[21294.50s -> 21316.68s]  I do? I don't know. Or do I just upgrade the hell out of the knife tuned weapon can make up for a
[21316.68s -> 21327.98s]  lack of skill. Why not try that on? That's about 40,000 for one and a half times attack speed.
[21328.86s -> 21340.95s]  I've never done that before. So maybe I could try it. Ruby's all rubbish. It makes no difference.
[21340.95s -> 21347.62s]  The price. Well, that's our choice to make. There's some things money. I'm going to hold
[21347.62s -> 21356.01s]  on to everything else. Anything else I can help you with 40,000. It's okay for now.
[21357.69s -> 21373.27s]  Check out my wares again. Great rifles. Probably the best at this point. Yeah. I mean,
[21373.27s -> 21391.96s]  there's a whole, I got one more chapter for this. So I want some max health, but it's sell those.
[21394.41s -> 21400.28s]  I'm not going to use them. These are so expensive.
[21401.24s -> 21404.84s]  A deal. Well, pleasant. And maybe I will just buy the rocket launcher
[21408.90s -> 21420.39s]  have like a super explosive thing at the end. All right. Handgun ammo is starting to get a
[21420.39s -> 21436.30s]  little low. You're going to regret that bolt action with the regenerators. That's why I'm
[21436.30s -> 21446.06s]  holding on to the rifle because, Oh my goodness. Bebop. No rock steady. I forget which one
[21455.46s -> 21481.83s]  hit me right in the forehead. Oh, kill him. Please. Another one. Where is he?
[21491.26s -> 21501.93s]  Oh, he's right behind me. He's not. Oh my God. Oh, that was all explosive bolts.
[21502.65s -> 21518.78s]  He just unloaded an entire magazine of rusty bolts. Hey, somebody said I looked rusty.
[21519.42s -> 21534.57s]  So I said, rusty bolts while I was saying explosive bolts, I saved it, right? Did I
[21534.97s -> 21544.26s]  write that? Did I screw that up? Yeah, we're good. Okay. Well that was kind of crazy.
[21544.98s -> 21581.00s]  Try it again. I think it's so good. All right. I got to go this way now. All right. I'm going
[21581.00s -> 21617.26s]  to blow you up when you land. All right. Where is he? Oh shit. Okay. You're dead. Collect everything.
[21617.26s -> 21637.66s]  Okay. This bunch of money over there. He's actually playing. I thought he just talks.
[21639.19s -> 21646.84s]  Well, we know what happens when I just talk. I, uh, I don't know that. I don't know Q and E rotate
[21647.56s -> 21658.17s]  a puzzle. And I turned my head upside down to see the thing right side up. Oh, look at how,
[21658.17s -> 21663.88s]  look at how pretty this is. This is like a, it's like Christmas. Somebody did all this.
[21664.68s -> 21677.22s]  Look at that. Is it for me? All the decorations. That's so cute. Thanks for me. Wait, treasure.
[21677.86s -> 21711.40s]  I should start using the knife more often. I think that's it. And yes.
[21732.46s -> 21738.87s]  Wait, why doesn't Ash, why doesn't Ashley have different clothes on?
[21740.87s -> 21748.26s]  If he's dressed like such an idiot. Wouldn't I have had her dressed in some
[21748.26s -> 21752.90s]  outfit too? I think she had sunglasses on.
[21765.59s -> 21789.62s]  Here comes the regenerators. Worst thing ever. Okay. I need to make sure I use that very well.
[21789.62s -> 21797.30s]  So we're going to the left. No we're not.
[21813.53s -> 21821.27s]  Sell two ornate beetles. There's one hidden in dissection in facility one.
[21821.27s -> 21822.55s]  And somebody stole the other.
[21830.62s -> 21833.58s]  Oh, just realized how much shit he has in his pockets.
[21833.90s -> 21852.22s]  All right. How much is the rocket launcher? 80. I'm going to hold. Hold my money.
[21856.89s -> 21870.68s]  Doing that for the regenerators only. What has he got in his pockets?
[21870.68s -> 21884.02s]  It's kinds of stuff. I need to get to the comms facility. It needs some power though.
[21884.02s -> 21903.75s]  What does he, what's in his pockets? I'm available. All right. Regenerators. I'm ready.
[21909.35s -> 21937.85s]  Don't have an automatic door. Yeah. The parasites watch out. They regenerate in.
[21938.57s -> 21991.50s]  Definitely. But it's okay. I'm hiding. Holy shit. Oh, a beetle. I'm not messing around.
[21996.87s -> 22033.13s]  Treasure in here? Where is it? Above? Hmm. No, nevermind. Okay. I am ready.
[22060.33s -> 22063.66s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. They run. They run. They run. It's running at me.
[22063.66s -> 22110.07s]  The book was way better. Is that back? It is. She played Venga bus, but really faded.
[22110.07s -> 22118.97s]  Like she's hearing Leon listen to it in the other room. I feel like that's the thing for post.
[22118.97s -> 22122.07s]  That's funny though. I'll give you, I'm going to give you a plus two for that one.
[22122.63s -> 22187.90s]  All right. Fine. That's fun. I'm doing it. Venga boys. You guys hear something?
[22187.90s -> 22217.27s]  Ow. Coming from the wall. It sounds like that's coming from below my feet.
[22217.27s -> 22283.64s]  This just sounds like it's coming out of her air pods. I just want to do this for a second.
[22283.64s -> 22286.84s]  Like, dude, he's fucking somebody. He's sleeping. Somebody wake him up.
[22286.84s -> 22299.70s]  Oh my God, man. I'm playing Resident Evil all fucking day. I'm tired, man,
[22299.70s -> 22336.82s]  but I got a playlist going. I sorry. I just wanted to make sure that
[22336.82s -> 22347.80s]  you had to deal with the muted audio in the VOD as well. Okay. Where are we going?
[22347.80s -> 22409.03s]  No, I got to go into the freezer. There is. That was bound to happen.
[22409.03s -> 22482.41s]  What the fuck? Oh goodness. I want that beetle. Jeez. Okay. I want that other beetle.
[22510.84s -> 22537.67s]  Hmm. Blood. What was this thing? Oh, there it is. Okay. I got both beetles.
[22537.67s -> 22585.77s]  Okay. Very cool. Now I got to get back down here. Science, math, English, reading,
[22585.77s -> 22610.33s]  arithmetic. He's in here somewhere. I don't know where though. Rotisserie chickens.
[22615.86s -> 22621.85s]  Why is there a rotisserie chicken down here in the, wait, okay. This is like the kitchen, I guess.
[22622.41s -> 22685.59s]  Wait, holy shit. Damn it. It just sounds like when Otto is sleeping.
[22685.59s -> 22719.54s]  I hit him. I didn't hit him in one parasite. What the fuck are you talking about? What the hell?
[22729.66s -> 22760.92s]  Why can I not hit this one? This one's been so finicky. That was very creepy.
[22761.48s -> 22804.79s]  Oh, you can't come through here. Would you guys rather fight one regenerator
[22804.79s -> 22809.27s]  with a grenade or fight two 100 duck-sized horses?
[22812.46s -> 22838.28s]  Oh, you motherfucker. Where are you? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't
[22838.28s -> 22846.84s]  know. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I don't know. How big is the grenade? First of all,
[22846.84s -> 22854.63s]  and do the duck-sized horses, do they, um, are they angry? Or that's a hard question.
[22854.63s -> 22890.20s]  Where is he now? That's the sound I would imagine that a big duck-sized horse would
[22890.20s -> 22895.80s]  make. So if they're going to make sounds like that, then boy, oh boy, I would want to be really
[22895.80s -> 22905.72s]  prepared for them because that's, that's tricky because they might get really loud in your ears
[22905.72s -> 22936.36s]  and die already. You're going to fall back in the recliner. Yeah. Like that'd be kind of funny
[22936.36s -> 22945.96s]  one day if I just threw back till I have like my both my feet be in the air. All right. Well,
[22945.96s -> 22965.27s]  that is why I did that. So I'm good now. It's getting late. Do I, um, is chapter seven really
[22965.27s -> 22978.79s]  just kind of an epilogue like fight the boss chapter or is it long? Pretty short. Yeah. Yeah.
[22978.79s -> 22994.82s]  We'll finish it. I imagine I'm getting close to the end of this chapter soon. I need to craft
[22994.82s -> 23041.54s]  some shit. Okay. Unlocked. That's the, where the power is. I got to put, oh wait, power.
[23042.26s -> 23058.28s]  They turn the beetles in, gets things done. Got a selection of good things on sale.
[23058.28s -> 23062.82s]  Stranger, your valuables won't do you much. Well,
[23064.82s -> 23069.38s]  10 spinals. Damn. All right. So what can I do now? We're getting kind of close to the end.
[23070.18s -> 23087.54s]  I can do this. I got pressures that I have on. Ooh, this would be good. Triple.
[23090.30s -> 23098.86s]  Thank you. Welcome. What can I interest you in? I'll buy it at a high price.
[23098.86s -> 23103.22s]  All right. One and a half times the tax speed. I feel like, is that really that big of a deal
[23103.78s -> 23109.06s]  to suit your specific needs? I'm not sure. I really want to spend the money on that.
[23111.48s -> 23124.89s]  Yeah. Striker charm. I could buy the rocket launcher and just store it.
[23126.60s -> 23132.57s]  Yeah, that's what I'm doing. All yours, stranger. Got a selection. Now.
[23134.49s -> 23147.61s]  Just hold on to it. Welcome. Can I buy rockets? Please have this in stock, stranger.
[23153.88s -> 23161.08s]  Um, I should probably just do some upgrades to this. Just a handgun. It's a one-time use. All
[23161.08s -> 23177.59s]  right. Maybe I just hold the money. Work. If I do say so myself. I want this information. Yeah.
[23180.15s -> 23193.86s]  Ruby's all rubbish. She makes no difference. Didn't I get a bunch of those arrows?
[23193.86s -> 23202.66s]  Blast arrows? That's our choice. Did I already sell them? I'll hold the money. Thank you.
[23202.66s -> 23212.97s]  Do check out my wares again soon. Get a TV dinner table. I actually think I'm probably
[23212.97s -> 23236.95s]  going to have one. Well, let's do it. I'm going to put it in. There are four people
[23236.95s -> 23242.47s]  fighting in the chat right now. Don't tell them stop. There should be able to get out now.
[23243.19s -> 23263.59s]  I'm going to have to pee one more time for the finale. So I will do that after this.
[23280.58s -> 23283.30s]  Not exactly covert, but it'll have to do.
[23287.10s -> 23291.58s]  Highly sensitive antenna array on the Island is finally complete.
[23293.32s -> 23298.30s]  Browser. Real bastard, isn't it?
[23300.82s -> 23344.70s]  Ow, excuse me. Good one. Well, this isn't good.
[23374.66s -> 23381.53s]  You suck at the gun. Run it back for a second. I don't think I missed one shot that whole ride.
[23382.09s -> 23413.35s]  My favorite carnival. Oh, let's just go ahead and take care of that right now.
[23427.72s -> 23449.72s]  Giant insects. I can't just destroy them or something. Hello.
[23461.38s -> 23465.91s]  I'm going to make a bunch of handgun ammo.
[23468.74s -> 23476.06s]  And I'm going to upgrade the handgun. I'm going to get the Punisher and I'm going to upgrade it.
[23477.27s -> 23493.62s]  You'll get some bang for your buck. I guarantee it. That's a good idea. The red nine is cool,
[23493.62s -> 23502.52s]  but I want to be able to go fast. I did the red nine in the last playthrough. Let's do Punisher.
[23525.48s -> 23532.02s]  Let's go like this. This kind of work is about finesse,
[23532.02s -> 23539.30s]  straight little bit goes a long way. You see anything pleasant travels.
[23540.02s -> 23562.30s]  Where is it? Is it equipped? What am I doing wrong here? Oh, OK. I was like, wait,
[23563.10s -> 23595.46s]  I want rate of fire now. Let's go. This is going to be fun. A radio tower. That's where I need to
[23595.46s -> 23620.36s]  go. Ada, you can see it from here. Why did you need to put the glasses on? Although a few hours
[23620.36s -> 23625.88s]  ago everyone was sitting there going, how the fuck does he not see this? How can he not see
[23625.88s -> 23630.76s]  that? He can like, you know, the shields and shit. Ada, actually, you know what? I take that back.
[23630.76s -> 23651.24s]  I take it back. I get it. I take it back. I didn't see it either. All right. Why are you running so
[23651.24s -> 23688.17s]  slow? I'm still alive. What the fuck? I wanted the money. I wanted the money so bad. A radio tower.
[23688.17s -> 23705.93s]  I thought I was in reach. I probably turn them off and can just come back out here.
[23706.73s -> 23768.33s]  Really? Really? Aim. He's got two. Was he double fisting Molotov cocktails?

[24509.55s -> 24536.75s]  will say I just break this the effects of the amber are greater than anything
[24536.75s -> 24542.05s]  I could have imagined Martin Nico was once a fragile uncontrollable test
[24542.05s -> 24550.42s]  subject impervious to conventional weapons now for the bad news it may be
[24550.42s -> 24555.42s]  stronger but it's a mental capacity has not improved at all right so I can't
[24555.42s -> 24566.82s]  hurt whatever this is with regular weapons this treasures in here wait a
[24566.82s -> 24628.22s]  minute I'm just gonna blow through this ceiling or what okay let's go oh you

[24817.44s -> 24824.05s]  it's gonna get I imagine this is probably a cutscene boss because I
[24824.05s -> 24830.82s]  can't hurt it with my guns so it's probably a cutscene boss nothing else to
[24830.82s -> 24886.70s]  do let's just go I was trying to get it to kill me anyways he's playing on the
[24886.70s -> 24921.46s]  difficulty that you can't fail this is it how to connect the device that was

[24926.54s -> 24930.70s]  glad cuz there's 6,000 buttons here I'm glad that the combination of six that I
[24930.70s -> 24935.71s]  put in a row were to disable the entire security system what a terrible dogshit
[24935.71s -> 24939.88s]  system that is by the way I feel like you could accidentally turn off all
[24939.88s -> 24952.78s]  security including the president's daughter won't that make things harder
[24952.78s -> 24961.30s]  for you there's no room for half measures the weak exist to serve the

[25513.14s -> 25538.21s]  stocking up while you can this is maxed out I'm gonna shoot the rocket launcher
[25538.21s -> 25551.49s]  anyways I just give her to all this stuff right why not much scope and
[25551.49s -> 25591.46s]  everything right okay I have the rocket launcher yeah I do it'll be a 60 year
[25591.46s -> 25608.91s]  old that collects knives that's a good one that's a good one all right time to
[25608.91s -> 25659.06s]  end the game holy shit that looks awful Wow maybe I will see him again I'm still
[25659.06s -> 25691.96s]  getting money wait what the fuck how's your hair like that as that because it
[25691.96s -> 25740.00s]  is oh do not know you reload I don't very much health I'll hold it for now
[25740.00s -> 25783.86s]  yeah he's still alive all right they've been doing all right yeah somebody asked
[25783.86s -> 25788.26s]  earlier they said it this is seven hours this is abnormal the last six months or
[25788.26s -> 25808.78s]  so it's part of the reason to be in this chair so much better now the frequency of
[25808.78s -> 25814.51s]  the streams is gonna stay the same right but I mean that this is not me telling you that
[25814.51s -> 25819.15s]  oh every stream is gonna be like seven to ten hours now that no no no it's just I'm
[25819.15s -> 25823.19s]  just much more comfortable than I was before and it's gonna improve it's gonna get better
[25823.19s -> 25838.16s]  I thought there was a stake when it first showed up on the screen but yeah my intention
[25838.16s -> 25847.43s]  is still you know slow it down and everything but I wanted to make sure this last kind of
[25847.43s -> 25853.31s]  arc you want to call it that was a lot more comfortable because I can sit here for whenever
[25853.31s -> 25859.27s]  I feel like it exactly what I'm doing right now it's like 12 15 at night just kind of here
[25860.27s -> 25879.34s]  oh I am out of everything what is going on why am I playing like Call of Duty world at war what
[25879.34s -> 25900.29s]  happened oh I sold the fucking scope wait treasure but it doesn't really matter we're done but I just
[25900.29s -> 25907.22s]  see the thing on the map and I want to go look at it and get it I'm glad I did it's a big one what
[25907.22s -> 25935.94s]  is it staff of royalty okay end of career voice hey I'm here right now I plan on staying here
[25935.94s -> 25942.31s]  instead of much reduced capacity like we talked about before but we don't have to we don't have
[25942.31s -> 25947.30s]  to talk about that we're playing Resident Evil with we don't have to talk about that hey remember
[25947.30s -> 25988.06s]  when I couldn't flip the fucking puzzle bring that up okay I hear it where is it use the rocket
[25988.06s -> 25997.41s]  launcher right now I have one shot in this I don't want to just use it on a regular guy that
[25997.41s -> 26020.94s]  just opens the door up I don't know the door could have been made of I don't know why I'm
[26020.94s -> 26098.50s]  doing this why am I doing why am I conducting an orchestra hat that's what happened control come
[26098.50s -> 26106.59s]  in I have the package this is gonna be hard to explain that customs well done
[26106.59s -> 26119.00s]  evacuate immediately understood he dies instantly he didn't get to say his fucking line restart now
[26119.00s -> 26134.75s]  no I know he's still alive why that was not the end he's still alive yeah he comes back and he's
[26134.75s -> 26144.88s]  like it's me and I yeah cuz we're up here I remember this I definitely should not have used
[26144.88s -> 26171.58s]  the rocket launcher there for whatever oh that was funny I don't even know what that boss fights
[26171.58s -> 26205.64s]  like should I just actually play it yeah that's all that matters is I won this right I wish I
[26205.64s -> 26249.52s]  had a second round obtain a powerful weapon okay I got the shiny thing on the ground first all
[26249.52s -> 26273.36s]  right let's go you're doing great down there Leon ooh a rocket launcher I wish I had one of those
[26273.36s -> 26344.32s]  oh shit I do have to hurry just go go go what what am I doing just run no no what is that what
[26344.32s -> 26387.84s]  is that what is that what is it that was a crazy explosion what are you doing shoot it oh my god

[26411.22s -> 26457.64s]  that's right so in this playthrough then who is a to shoot or does Leon shoot it it's Leon
[26457.64s -> 26480.00s]  definitely they wouldn't retcon the whole game okay it's a it's a it's a big one not in my
[26480.00s -> 26493.16s]  inventory it's just it's it's a cutscene I get it what are these bugs even doing here still
[26493.16s -> 26590.52s]  surprise it oh Ashley oh yeah no don't throw a grenade over there you got two minutes with
[26590.52s -> 26623.44s]  seconds to spare I feel like that would explode wouldn't it just blow up
[26623.76s -> 26680.70s]  nothing personally on the reason I had an arrangement don't worry I'll take good care
[26680.70s -> 26697.55s]  of it right here it is just so calm this collective is where we go our separate ways
[26697.55s -> 26705.02s]  look at the end of this she gets back I see goes into her house her apartment whoever grabs
[26705.02s -> 26744.45s]  the pillow holds it here and just fucking screams hello it's Wesker it's my stuff where's
[26744.45s -> 26752.68s]  my kyber crystal my lightsaber it's a yellow one my favorite patch me through yellow means
[26752.68s -> 26757.64s]  that you're intelligent and not evil and smart I've obtained the amber it's what all the nerds
[26757.64s -> 26764.65s]  want is their lightsabers that are purple just one question what are you planning to do with
[26764.65s -> 26774.01s]  this do not pay you to ask questions I wanted a yellow lightsaber no is a new dawn is breaking
[26774.01s -> 26783.72s]  self-report a hundred will give their lives so that just one may live expediting that change
[26783.72s -> 26808.98s]  so we're talking millions of casualties billions how ambitious we're changing course now Wesker
[26808.98s -> 26838.90s]  why like wrong okay that's good it's really fun but it was at seven hours and a half that
[26838.90s -> 26844.66s]  well that's you know take a like hour and 45 minutes away from the puzzles that are good
[26844.66s -> 26862.47s]  but it's total game time five hours five now that was good you're gonna play city skylines
[26862.47s -> 26891.95s]  too oh yeah absolutely I'll say for sure post credits did you play Mortal Kombat just for a
[26891.95s -> 26900.67s]  little bit I tried it out for a few hours I'm just not very good at fighting games fighting
[26900.67s -> 26906.65s]  games are really fun to watch but they're not really fun to play for me fighting games are
[26906.65s -> 26912.05s]  kind of like puzzle games in my brain a series of very specific actions have to happen in a very
[26912.05s -> 26936.67s]  specific order or you lose real-time puzzle games yeah isn't that every video game um well very
[26936.79s -> 26955.54s]  specific actions in the context of you know what I mean when I say that you have to do a very
[26955.54s -> 26963.45s]  specific set of actions to be able to do these moves and to be able to predict what your opponent
[26963.45s -> 26971.02s]  will do this is every video game I saw a lot of trues though you guys know what I mean we're gonna
[26971.02s -> 26987.92s]  read between the lines here real okay so in a puzzle game well you can play a lot of games in
[26987.92s -> 26995.68s]  different ways like I can I can press W and then let go and I'll be fine right like if I just walk
[26995.68s -> 26999.52s]  forward in a fighting game and stop moving it's over I'm gonna get comboed and I'm gonna get
[26999.52s -> 27008.23s]  together I'm dead you have to string together a very specific set of actions in a row it's
[27008.23s -> 27013.39s]  there's no time for you to stop you can't just stop playing you can't just oh I'm gonna go in
[27013.39s -> 27020.15s]  my inventory for a minute nope if you're not doing it down forward slash B walk jump down
[27020.15s -> 27026.88s]  forward B jump back down forward slash B it's like a rhythm game it's like a puzzle rhythm game you
[27026.88s -> 27032.88s]  have to really be paying attention every single millisecond of the time in action everything in a
[27032.88s -> 27040.10s]  row and I don't know I kind of like to be able to blink a few times and not worry about it oh
[27040.10s -> 27059.48s]  I thought this is the post-credits for like six hours I spent an hour and 25 minutes doing
[27059.48s -> 27067.78s]  nothing I love watching fighting games I like watching people play them but the series of very
[27067.78s -> 27085.10s]  specific actions in a row I can't do did he see that wait he got to see that that rating how long
[27085.10s -> 27093.26s]  it took for me to play the game he's watching my stream right now ah he's fucking terrible B six
[27093.26s -> 27100.38s]  hours of game time too I would have figured out that puzzle really quickly he's just watching
[27100.38s -> 27107.16s]  he's just chatting in my chat right now being mean to me when I had a fucking gas leak in my
[27107.16s -> 27121.78s]  room I don't know why I was so bad at that no oh yeah defiance changes nothing besides we have
[27121.78s -> 27156.79s]  all we continue as planned soon son was set on the age of man I feel like if Wesker just took a
[27156.79s -> 27165.97s]  bath he would kind of not give a shit about this anymore a big bubble bath with an iPad I feel like
[27165.97s -> 27174.64s]  you'd be like you know what actually I'm gonna settle down I'm just gonna relax now don't ever
[27174.64s -> 27202.54s]  underestimate what can be solved in a bath okay serious I will try somebody said just even open
[27202.54s -> 27215.64s]  it I'm not gonna try or play but I'll just hop in and check it out the mercenaries I got my points
[27215.64s -> 27244.36s]  costume unlocked lots of costumes my goodness what is by the helicopter guy he's in he's in
[27244.36s -> 27269.44s]  the movie for five minutes oh no no okay it's a model I should wait I want to go back where do I
[27269.44s -> 27304.83s]  do the what do I do the outfits out campaign only okay okay we're gonna go with a rank or above as
[27304.87s -> 27332.56s]  Ada I think I can get that pretty quickly green needle I just want to see Wesker because I'm
[27332.56s -> 27343.23s]  probably not gonna play this again anytime soon really maybe I played in my kind of off time but
[27343.23s -> 27373.18s]  what do I need for a let's get to a and I oh no it's already over that's not what is mayhem a
[27373.18s -> 27391.34s]  motor just like good aiming or just when it kills it when it headshot kills it's like instant reloads
[27391.46s -> 27426.55s]  kind of like Leon's seems pretty good seems pretty good I don't lose the combo all right
[27426.55s -> 27479.22s]  incoming where is he where are you it is good it is really fun to play that's a molotov don't lose
[27479.22s -> 27530.66s]  the combo I'm just gonna let the timer now I'll have a oh where is he whoa still alive no he's
[27530.86s -> 27588.52s]  right oh no bad I'm gonna get out of the way oh shit don't throw that shit at me right now all
[27588.52s -> 27630.76s]  right I definitely have a I am in trouble but I should be oh I gotta heal uh I'll keep it going
[27630.76s -> 27676.02s]  might as well oh I guess oh shit careful here I need to get the fuck out of the way all right
[27676.02s -> 27688.33s]  326 wow wow wow oh no I got stuck on that guy the guy in front of me was just kind of weirdly

[27708.27s -> 27729.96s]  there's docs all right let's play Wesker so what does he got he's got the Magnum he's got the
[27730.16s -> 27753.32s]  seven okay that's that's goofy don't can I turn into a monster or something what about the other
[27753.32s -> 27761.26s]  gun yeah it's one of these let me see he actually probably is the most fun to play because the
[27761.26s -> 27789.94s]  Magnum all right will you stop that's cool come on through guns kind of slow but it's still fun
[27789.94s -> 27838.76s]  all right mayhem mode what is it oh yeah he does melee attacks all right that's awesome where's
[27838.84s -> 27867.25s]  yeah okay that might be it Jesus let's flip that guy off holy shit I just got a lot of people there
[27867.25s -> 27914.74s]  these bugs are flying around okay I get a better vantage point in this the melee is amazing you
[27914.74s -> 27943.81s]  shithead whoa oh I'm stuck on something in the tunnel oh god I just kicked this guy's ass he

[28042.50s -> 28053.43s]  for watching uh somebody said to give a rating to separate ways I kind of think it's just part of
[28053.43s -> 28063.06s]  Resident Evil 4 which is a 9.5 to me it's just another few chapters extended onto the game
[28063.06s -> 28078.19s]  Resident Evil 4 is a great game it's just a remake of that it was a little different though I don't
[28078.19s -> 28082.15s]  remember a lot of those encounters in separate ways did I even I don't know if I played second
[28082.15s -> 28096.84s]  boys maybe I did do you like puzzles well the problem is I get like in a feedback loop where I
[28096.84s -> 28105.18s]  get stuck on something and then I try to go as fast I can to fix it and then it makes it even
[28105.18s -> 28119.00s]  worse but I was fine it was fine I can just be kind of a dummy sometimes but it's okay we have
[28119.72s -> 28129.02s]  our weaknesses and one of my weaknesses is shooting at shields on a ball in the correct
[28129.02s -> 28144.19s]  order lies if he is my favorite souls like that isn't from software damn saw X was really good
[28144.19s -> 28148.31s]  too damn okay I'm getting some pretty good recommendations right now of things I thought
[28148.31s -> 28160.48s]  I might want to do but yeah I'll see you guys Monday thanks for watching it's the first almost
[28160.48s -> 28169.57s]  eight hour stream in a long time it's not gonna be the norm but it is possible see you guys on
