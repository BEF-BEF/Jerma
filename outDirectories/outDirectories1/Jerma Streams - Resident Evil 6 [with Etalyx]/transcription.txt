[5.94s -> 19.66s]  Hello, how you doing? Do you have a lot of new emotes? You're right. What's up? Let's go already.
[19.66s -> 26.28s]  Let's get been I'm not late. I was here at 330. It's like this I said, I said Resident Evil six
[26.28s -> 32.68s]  is a banger. Resident Evil six is the worst Resident Evil game. Wait, hold on. Worst numbered
[32.68s -> 39.93s]  Resident Evil game, I think. Wait, hold on. It might be better than the first one. I know
[39.93s -> 44.25s]  everybody. Look, I don't like the tank controls. 20 years ago, I didn't like tank controls.
[45.43s -> 57.99s]  It automatically is like in a different category for me. Resident Evil. Yeah, they're all good.
[59.66s -> 73.51s]  And controls. I it's just it just ruins it for me. It ruins it just does. Anyways,
[73.51s -> 76.95s]  we got some stuff to talk about. We've got some exciting things to talk about. Well,
[76.95s -> 86.71s]  I mean, kind of exciting. First most important thing is tonight is the night where the New Year's
[86.71s -> 94.39s]  Eve nomination categories are going up. You'll be able to nominate for each category. Make
[94.39s -> 99.35s]  sure you follow the rules. They're going to be very, very clearly posted. I'm going to give you
[99.35s -> 109.37s]  guys probably 10 days, 12 days to nominate stuff. And a day after the nominations close,
[109.37s -> 115.53s]  I'm going to go through, make the list, and you'll be able to vote on the worst and best
[115.53s -> 125.88s]  stings of the year. Really important to note. Very important. The dollhouse is not nominatable
[125.88s -> 134.92s]  in a handful of categories. So to make it so dollhouse doesn't like inhale 10 different
[134.92s -> 144.07s]  categories, it is not eligible for best stream of the year. It's not eligible for best joke taking
[144.07s -> 147.27s]  more than five minutes to set up because I know a lot of people probably nominate stuff for that.
[147.91s -> 153.62s]  So just imagine dollhouse is grayed out in its own world and there's a new category that's
[153.62s -> 161.83s]  best dollhouse moment. So dollhouse has its own category. You're probably also probably
[161.83s -> 166.39s]  wondering if worst Peter's on there. Of course it is. I don't think I said it once. I think that's
[166.39s -> 172.25s]  the only time I said it the whole year. It's just on there. It has to be on there. I don't even care.
[177.99s -> 182.87s]  There's, yeah, there's one right there. I don't know. I was going to take it off,
[182.87s -> 191.85s]  but I was like, you know what? I don't care. Wait. Oh, I gotta make sure I didn't get kicked
[191.85s -> 200.17s]  in the lobby, which I may have. We kicked. No, he's here. Just making sure that he wasn't kicked.
[200.73s -> 205.58s]  You gotta move around a little bit. Okay. Currently me and it's Alex are currently in
[206.14s -> 212.23s]  Resident Evil 6. We're in a lobby. We're going to play. This is the Resident Evil 6 stream that
[212.23s -> 216.95s]  I've been literally like just putting off and just not doing for like the last three weeks,
[216.95s -> 222.78s]  three and a half, four weeks. Here we are. Good question. When is tomorrow's stream? Oh,
[222.78s -> 229.78s]  no, that's when is Toontown stream. I don't know. But would you like to hear the series of events
[229.78s -> 235.64s]  that is going to be pretty exciting stuff? They were playing Resident Evil 6, never going to
[235.64s -> 241.59s]  play this again. I would assume after like three or four hours, maybe five hours tops, I'm just
[241.59s -> 245.51s]  like, I fucking have to leave. I don't want to play this anymore. I'm going to be very surprised
[245.51s -> 249.83s]  if that's not the case. So you'll never see this ever again. In fact, I can't wait to uninstall it
[250.15s -> 258.31s]  from steam. Secondly, on the eighth, guess what comes out on the eighth? I didn't even know this
[258.31s -> 266.25s]  until a week ago. That's right. Monster Rancher one and two remake. It's not a remake. It's just a port.
[267.34s -> 274.58s]  We're going to play it. You bet your ass. And then on the ninth, game awards, obviously,
[274.58s -> 281.38s]  I'll be streaming the game awards like I always do. Then that's it. That's all I have planned for
[281.38s -> 292.87s]  this week. I'm very excited. I'm very excited to play Monster Rancher one and two. Beanbag Sonic
[292.87s -> 301.61s]  lives again. I'm really glad the game awards are at like four o'clock in the afternoon or five in
[301.61s -> 310.25s]  the afternoon. You want some lore? Remember the Nintendo Direct that was at 9am Pacific?
[312.17s -> 316.33s]  That was I don't think I even showered. I just ripped myself out of bed, ran in the room,
[316.33s -> 321.93s]  put my bathrobe on, put some water in my hair and turned it on. I felt like shit during that stream.
[325.78s -> 329.54s]  Nothing happens before noon here. It just does. It's been like that since I was like 12,
[330.10s -> 340.39s]  15. Doesn't matter. I, I, guys, I can't even eat before noon. I get up in the morning and it's like,
[340.39s -> 348.18s]  nope, nothing. I can't, I'm useless until 12 o'clock. And then at 2pm, I'm at peak readiness. Here
[348.18s -> 353.94s]  we go. From two to 10 or two to eight is like, I got the most energy. I'm ready to go. I'm hungry.
[353.94s -> 363.06s]  I'm ready to go. I don't know. Why is that? Why is my body reject food for two or three hours
[363.06s -> 367.14s]  after I wake up? I don't get it. I don't, I'm not, my hunger reflex is gone. I'm like, it makes me
[367.14s -> 378.82s]  kind of nauseous. It's an ADHD thing. Is it really? That's interesting. Somebody said you're gaining
[378.82s -> 386.18s]  viewers. Uh, yeah. I just turned the stream on. Yeah. Of course it's going to be gaining viewers.
[386.18s -> 393.99s]  It's the first five minutes of the stream. What you need to do is you need to wait till like the
[393.99s -> 399.11s]  end of the stream or after like a few hours of Resident Evil 6 and like 4,000 people that are
[399.11s -> 403.43s]  here. They say like POG a bunch of times and then they just leave because this game sucks.
[405.86s -> 410.42s]  I, I'm ready. That's when you say viewers plummeting, right? You got to be ready for that
[410.42s -> 422.10s]  one. What? How many people are here now? Oh shit. Oh shit. The six K all ready. We haven't even
[422.10s -> 430.22s]  started. I, you know what? I'll tell you. I have not even been paying attention to my view count.
[430.86s -> 435.56s]  I haven't even been looking at it. It's just something that I know exists.
[436.28s -> 443.40s]  Nine K. No, no, I don't care. Don't get me looking at the view count. I don't even want to look at
[443.40s -> 449.18s]  it. They could be a hundred people here or like a hundred thousand. I don't even want to know.
[449.98s -> 456.79s]  Don't tell me what I mean. If we hit 20 K, then I got to celebrate that one already. Well, I already
[456.79s -> 468.14s]  did. You're going to do a face reveal. Yeah. You're a pot. You've got a positive outlook. No, I just,
[468.14s -> 472.38s]  all right. I just want, I'm just not, I don't want to pay attention to it. Why would I?
[472.94s -> 481.99s]  Let me check and see if he's here. Not. But yeah, I have, while there's more people trickling in,
[481.99s -> 487.67s]  just listen. End of the year awards. There's a lot of new people since the last time we did this. So
[487.67s -> 493.51s]  let's make this really clear. This is, I believe the fourth annual worst shit of the year awards
[494.31s -> 500.55s]  where it's not like a typical award stream that you may be used to. We go over, over the course
[500.55s -> 506.15s]  of 2021. All the worst shit, all like the cringiest, weirdest shit that I, that apparently I've done.
[507.11s -> 510.71s]  There's also best stream of the year. There's also like best joke of the year.
[511.35s -> 516.63s]  It's things like worst face, worst sound I made, worst singing, worst impressions,
[516.63s -> 529.46s]  best impression, best noise. It's, it's fun. Irma and cringe never. Worst shit 2021.
[529.94s -> 536.23s]  Yeah. Best one guy. We take what's something that one guy in the community did.
[537.19s -> 545.93s]  The emote, right? When are you going to do a Neanderthal collab? Let's go Neanderthal. Let's go.
[549.54s -> 556.54s]  I somebody, every time. All right. Listen, anytime anybody ever says like, Oh dude,
[557.34s -> 562.14s]  what, when are you going to do collab with this person? Oh, hold on. Let me call them right now.
[562.46s -> 575.10s]  Oh, hey, hey, before you say any words. Hey, do you want to do a collab stream on Monday? Yeah.
[575.10s -> 581.18s]  I got time. You got time? Okay. Now, now say hello. What do you want to do? It's just if it happens,
[581.18s -> 585.50s]  it happens. It depends. There's a project that I think is interesting. If I want to collaborate
[585.50s -> 589.26s]  with somebody, then we collaborate. I think Neanderthal is, Neanderthal is fucking hilarious.
[594.02s -> 598.50s]  Of course that would be fun. Maybe, but like you, you, it just, it's, if it's gonna happen,
[598.50s -> 604.39s]  maybe it, it could. I would say that about anybody. Literally anyone.
[616.02s -> 622.42s]  Everyone calling me anti-social Andy. I'm about to do a collaboration in 10 minutes. Like I'm in
[622.42s -> 631.02s]  the call right now with somebody. It don't matter. I'm, I'm open to collaborations, but I'm closed
[631.02s -> 634.92s]  to everything. That's really weird to say, but it's, it's accurate.
[643.11s -> 646.95s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on a minute. I'm open to collaborations.
[646.95s -> 655.98s]  I am closed to solicitations. Okay. That's perfect way to say it. When are you going to do 1080p
[655.98s -> 666.57s]  streams? Um, I don't know when, when I, I'm not going to know. I don't know. Okay. I think we're
[666.57s -> 675.21s]  ready. Hey, did we get kicked out of the lobby? I hope not. I haven't been looking. Okay. You're,
[675.21s -> 680.41s]  you're actually in. Okay. Cool. Yeah. So tapping freaks me out though. Yeah. I don't like it.
[681.21s -> 693.56s]  Let's see. The camera's not on the camera on. Please don't be on. Don't be on. All right.
[693.56s -> 701.86s]  That's a freeze frame. It's good. I don't have one camera. All right. So we're going to play
[701.86s -> 706.74s]  resident evil six. It's going to be a fun time. It's going to be fun. Yeah. Like I would, like
[706.74s -> 711.06s]  I was telling Chaz, it's, this is the best, most critically acclaimed resident evil. This is the
[711.06s -> 718.26s]  worst one. What does your title say? It's my title says, uh, I got a, yeah, maybe I'll tap.
[718.26s -> 722.74s]  My title says picking the best resident evil for the Halloween co-op stream. You're going to tell
[722.74s -> 727.62s]  mine says this is the worst. My sense, my, my stream title, I swear to God actually says
[727.62s -> 734.12s]  literally the worst one. So, I mean, we'll find out that's that's yin and yang energy right there.
[734.12s -> 737.88s]  All right. So when we skip the opening cut scene, cause who really cares? There's a virus on the
[737.88s -> 740.76s]  loose and we have to track down the fucking tyrant or whatever. All right, let's go.
[741.48s -> 747.91s]  You ready? I'm walking as fast as I can towards this door. I don't, there's no sprint in resident
[747.91s -> 754.55s]  evil six, right? I didn't see one. There's a dash. There's a dash. There's a dash. Yeah. There's a
[754.55s -> 759.70s]  dash button. I don't know what it is. Cause I did the tutorial with a controller. Oh, that's right.
[759.70s -> 763.30s]  You're on controller. I'm on keyboard. I switched the keyboard and mouse cause you made me feel
[763.30s -> 766.74s]  insecure. You were like, I gotta, I gotta up my accuracy. So I was like, well, I gotta compete.
[766.74s -> 770.42s]  I gotta up my accuracy. So then I switched the mouse. Well, but the whole point is that
[771.24s -> 774.44s]  I would have more accuracy than you. Cause you're on controller and now you're going to make me look
[774.44s -> 782.04s]  bad. Turn on an ass cam. How would that work? Where would the cams on by default? If you haven't
[782.04s -> 789.53s]  changed the FOV, it's pretty zoomed in. Yeah. I did. I moved the FOV. What? Yeah. You have to do
[789.53s -> 797.18s]  that from the main menu. I was told. What do you, no, you don't. Oh yeah. You do. How do you wait?
[797.90s -> 803.06s]  Why am I just standing here? Cause it's a co-op moment. Oh, it's a co-op thing. I don't know how
[803.06s -> 812.66s]  to. Okay. There we go. Hey, press V. It's your best bet. Aim for the head. If somebody's, if you
[812.66s -> 817.22s]  want to toggle sprint, you have to go to the main menu and press the hilarious joke that everyone's
[817.22s -> 823.43s]  heard a thousand times back in like 2010. All right. I think sprint is all F4. Is that what
[823.43s -> 829.26s]  they're saying? You got it. All right. So this is how it works. We have to. I hope so. Okay. It's
[829.26s -> 834.71s]  actually, I think it's double tap W or shift. Is it? I've shift doesn't do anything. All right.
[834.71s -> 838.63s]  That feels good. But just, I want to make this really clear to everybody watching right now.
[838.79s -> 843.05s]  I have a script running in the background to make it so I can toggle right click. How do you think
[843.05s -> 847.93s]  streams happen? There's a script. No, but listen, like you think the humor comes off top of the
[847.93s -> 853.85s]  head. There's a script. There's probably something that's going to need. There's probably something
[853.85s -> 858.33s]  that's going to need me to just tap right click. And you have to do it because I have a script.
[858.33s -> 863.37s]  Neither of us have responded to a single individual chatter on the entire streams. I did. I did like
[863.37s -> 869.54s]  five seconds ago. You just don't pay attention to your chat. Like I do. You don't know. I'm like
[869.54s -> 875.48s]  me and my chat get together. We know each other. All right. Follow the shot. We can actually run.
[875.48s -> 883.62s]  This is good. Oh, happy birthday. Is it your birthday? Holy shit. Thanks. Why did I say thanks?
[884.82s -> 889.78s]  Hey, is it your birthday? Yeah. Thanks dude. I'm so glad that you were born and you live.
[892.54s -> 897.10s]  All right. So I'll be honest with you. I got to be really honest with you.
[897.10s -> 900.55s]  Uh huh. I don't care about any of this. You don't care about my birthday?
[901.53s -> 912.01s]  Okay. Of course I care about your birthday. What? Why is everybody saying? Oh, the game's quiet.
[912.01s -> 921.21s]  Yeah, I know. I'm a quiet game, Andy. We're chasing somebody. So we missed the opening cut scene.
[921.21s -> 927.48s]  Yeah. Wait, this is in media res. This is going to be one of those. Okay. Really though? That's how
[927.48s -> 933.24s]  the real game opens. They start with like a badass action scene because they're afraid they're not
[933.24s -> 938.36s]  going to like catch your attention in time. So a helicopter is like scraping a train and then
[938.36s -> 943.24s]  the bad guy drops in and then they go, Oh, it's you again. And then it cuts to like three weeks
[943.24s -> 947.80s]  earlier and that's where we're at now. I thought I was playing the stacker game at the who's puking.
[947.80s -> 956.44s]  Did you see the birthday cake? I mean, I don't turn that up. All right. Is that better? I was
[956.44s -> 961.21s]  like, that was like grocery store birthday cake. It probably just in the bathroom.
[961.21s -> 967.02s]  Is that better? I can hear you now. Well, I just for the end game. I have it low.
[967.02s -> 973.26s]  Why can't I not fire my gun? Did you try to shoot me at the same time? No, I'm sure. I, why do we
[973.26s -> 980.76s]  have any body? We don't have bullets in our weapons that we brought here. I'm going to put an orange
[980.76s -> 984.92s]  tip on the muzzle of this gun. This is giving me a headache because of how like shitty the frame
[984.92s -> 991.13s]  rate is for this. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Is your, uh, is your 30 80 not qualified for this
[991.13s -> 996.65s]  2012 video game? Does this look as bad as it does? It just looks awful. I mean, it looks like 2012,
[996.65s -> 1002.26s]  but the frame rate's fine. My frame rate's all over the place. It's just really zoomed in.
[1006.49s -> 1013.34s]  Wait, you dropped your phone. I think it's off. I turned the V sync on and I capped frames to 60.
[1013.34s -> 1025.30s]  I did that too. Maybe it's trying to render 120. That's weird. I might have to fix this
[1025.30s -> 1028.50s]  eventually. All right. What, once we get like into this, cause you need to, let's fix it now.
[1028.50s -> 1034.68s]  Well, no, cause we need to save point cause I don't want to do this again. Let's get to like a point.
[1036.44s -> 1041.69s]  We call them checkpoints as cameras. All right. Search the campus for Liz.
[1043.96s -> 1047.64s]  I, I don't understand why we have our guns out holding it like this.
[1048.20s -> 1053.32s]  We don't have bullets. Why would we have them out? There we go. That's a book and that's what
[1053.32s -> 1059.16s]  I'm talking about. How do you melee? Um, take out a knife and you can swing the knife. I think
[1059.16s -> 1062.20s]  you can kick without that. You, there's like, there's like a, there's like a melee dedicate.
[1063.38s -> 1069.16s]  That guy didn't get scared at all. Why did he not get scared?
[1075.37s -> 1079.50s]  Should we be looking for weapons? The lights are on. Oh, in here.
[1080.06s -> 1089.46s]  Wait, I did. I do have ammo. It says I have 18. I have what? Oh, oh, okay. Now, now we have 17.
[1090.10s -> 1097.98s]  Where do you even see 17 coming out of my eyeballs? Oh no, we have a, we have an ear mounted.
[1097.98s -> 1100.94s]  Where do you see set? Like you have to physically count the bullets over there.
[1101.90s -> 1106.87s]  I don't know. I just took the number that you said. I think it's in the inventory.
[1106.87s -> 1111.93s]  All right. Don't do anything. Cool. I'm going to, I'm going to all tap for a second.
[1112.57s -> 1119.54s]  Hope you don't get booted. Okay. All right. This guy does not, nothing phases this guy.
[1121.50s -> 1126.94s]  He's the main character. That's quite a draft. He's leading us like we're the NPC on the follow
[1126.94s -> 1132.20s]  mission. He's escorting us. Why is he not reacting to any of this? I've seen some shit.
[1132.84s -> 1140.90s]  Yeah. You have a hole in your head. I feel like somebody drilled a hole like that.
[1140.90s -> 1145.70s]  Demons are escaping you. Like your soul is escaping. Oh, from the light. You've got a light too.
[1145.70s -> 1150.42s]  Yeah. But it's, it's like a weird hole in your head. Like a luscious locks. Oh, you got Leon.
[1150.42s -> 1154.52s]  You got no brain in there, man. I can shine a flashlight in there and just see light.
[1154.52s -> 1159.08s]  Personal attacks. I'm your partner. I'm your resident partner for like the last 10 years in
[1159.08s -> 1164.04s]  this game. How are we going? I have some respect for the most popular resident evil character of
[1164.04s -> 1177.98s]  all time. Helena. Who is everybody knows Helena from the opening cut scene of this game. I don't
[1177.98s -> 1183.74s]  like the fact that we can't do just what happened. I thought he shot me. Does that hurt me? Uh,
[1183.74s -> 1190.42s]  that was a balloon jump scare. Oh, that was bad. I missed every shot. It's your daddy controller
[1190.42s -> 1195.22s]  has auto. He just say it's your daddy. I think we're looking for his daughter or something. I
[1195.22s -> 1201.51s]  don't know. Okay. Can we just kill him now? He's clearly infected. You don't know that though.
[1202.55s -> 1205.51s]  You're going to shoot him that you're going to do what I just tried to do. It didn't work.
[1207.94s -> 1212.42s]  Wait, is he running for president of the United States? Is this the same president?
[1212.42s -> 1222.42s]  Adam Benford. It's this guy. Okay. I just scared him. All right. The chandelier dropping and like
[1222.42s -> 1226.50s]  a fire starting in front of him is not scary, but he's like looking at like the constitution
[1226.50s -> 1230.82s]  of whatever this is. And it scared the shit out of him. Get ready to kill him. I will be once I
[1230.82s -> 1236.58s]  find my daughter. Hang on. Are you saying a politician is scared of the constitution
[1236.58s -> 1243.27s]  of the United States? Oh, that's so relevant. I think we have to open this. No, he's just opening
[1243.27s -> 1251.74s]  it. How do you reload? I have no idea. Wait, do we, we can't even reload. No extra ammo. Oh,
[1251.74s -> 1256.14s]  by the way, it's his fault if we die because he put, he said we should put it on veteran.
[1256.14s -> 1262.65s]  It's your fault. If we'd lose the medium difficulty, there's five difficulties.
[1262.65s -> 1268.25s]  Veterans, the third one, but I worked. That's just enough to not lose gamer points, but it's
[1268.25s -> 1271.77s]  also not enough to gain gamer points. I mean, I'm just saying we, we could have said we were on
[1271.77s -> 1279.78s]  veteran and plan easy. All right. So wait, wait, wait. So he, we have to make the elevator work.
[1282.94s -> 1290.34s]  Okay, wait, we need to, he's gliding over here. Okay. This is cool.
[1292.47s -> 1297.21s]  Resident Evil six is actually a walking simulator. The guns are kind of like in
[1297.21s -> 1301.29s]  universal studios when you go on ride, you know, they're just little laser points that you can
[1301.29s -> 1307.13s]  tally up at the end of the game. It is weird to not have the flashlight on the gun. It's like on
[1307.13s -> 1314.76s]  the side of our heads. 2012, that wasn't invented yet. You're not paying attention. Like extra
[1314.76s -> 1320.81s]  dynamic light. Careful as it doesn't really matter if I'm paying attention. I have watched like at
[1320.81s -> 1324.49s]  least one or two Will Ferrell movies with no sound on and just like, I can know what's happening by
[1324.49s -> 1330.33s]  the movements that he's doing on screen. I got, it doesn't matter. Why do you have to take the left?
[1330.33s -> 1337.22s]  I don't know. I don't like your mother, like mom calls and like I want to talk to mom for like an
[1337.22s -> 1343.80s]  hour and a half, which is just the exact runtime of like Will Ferrell's last movie. I didn't even
[1343.80s -> 1355.45s]  aim and it did it for me. Yeah. How long, how long is it like a phone call with mom? It's usually
[1355.45s -> 1360.01s]  like an hour or two, right? Yeah. Exactly. That's what I'm saying. Why is everyone question marking?
[1363.32s -> 1366.76s]  Are you saying that playing this game is like, call it reminds you of calling your mom?
[1367.70s -> 1371.94s]  No, I'm just saying a Will Ferrell movie is the exact length of time for a phone call with mom.
[1372.74s -> 1375.94s]  Yeah. So next time you're watching a Will Ferrell movie, just think about the last time you called
[1375.94s -> 1384.58s]  your mom and then mute the Will Ferrell movie. 10 minutes. Excuse me. You got to talk to mom longer
[1384.58s -> 1388.76s]  than that. That depends on if you, if, okay, but here's the thing you're talking to a bunch of
[1388.76s -> 1394.36s]  people who still live with mom. So they can't fathom calling her because she's in the other room.
[1394.36s -> 1399.56s]  I would, I would agree with that maybe a little bit, but we did a poll, we did like a census on
[1399.56s -> 1406.92s]  the channel and it's like 40% doctor, 20% scientist. Um, there's like 10% uh, like
[1407.48s -> 1415.16s]  firefighter and shit. Like these people, they're not just like at home. Okay. You got, you got like
[1415.80s -> 1422.06s]  a large proportion of firefighting moms in chat. When do we get to play the game?
[1423.10s -> 1428.58s]  The one they're waiting for. Oh, they're waiting for us to go to the elevator.
[1428.58s -> 1434.04s]  Hold on. We're going to have to move this. It's going to take both of our combined strength.
[1434.04s -> 1441.67s]  Is it really? Oh, it does. We're here. This whole game so far has been just like
[1441.67s -> 1448.26s]  your annoying upstairs neighbor in your apartment. It's just been the fucking sounds like the walking
[1448.26s -> 1456.86s]  sounds. Oh, the creaking boards. Okay. Oh, this is so ugly. I'm really sorry for everybody that has
[1456.86s -> 1468.34s]  to put up with this for now. There was entire fan base is milked. I can't imagine like that.
[1468.34s -> 1476.60s]  Like, no magic doing like a meet and greet. It's like all like older women. It's all like,
[1476.60s -> 1480.04s]  just do they are for the meet and greet. If you stay a streamer long enough,
[1480.04s -> 1497.83s]  make that a reality. I mean, I'm almost 40, man. That's called daytime TV.
[1507.24s -> 1511.80s]  What cry is that? I thought that, I thought that was the game. He just like freaked me out.
[1512.68s -> 1527.35s]  I was like, why are they leaning so hard into that? Got to do the puking off screen. This is
[1527.35s -> 1531.51s]  a hard. So let's, let's, let's get this ready. I'm going to shoot, I'm going to shoot them in
[1531.51s -> 1537.05s]  the head. You shoot them in the chest. We're going to shoot them five times each. Now I'm going to
[1537.05s -> 1540.41s]  shoot. I'm going to shoot once in the head. All right. I don't think you have a choice.
[1540.41s -> 1547.45s]  What the fuck is this one? What was that? What was that? Like DDR? Like 300. It was just DDR.
[1550.50s -> 1555.14s]  Why is the camera? I thought that was her doing that to you for a second.
[1555.14s -> 1558.50s]  It's like, why did you have the gun? Did you pull the trigger or was that all of me? I shot,
[1558.50s -> 1564.39s]  I shot him. I shot her in the back. Is it arrow keys? I think, I think it's just WASD correlates.
[1564.39s -> 1568.55s]  We'll get used to it. This is going to get really difficult with the QTs on keyboard.
[1573.05s -> 1578.33s]  How could this? I was about to scream it, but I, you're in, I don't, I feel like. It's like a yawn.
[1578.33s -> 1584.92s]  Now I want to. I was about to scream it, but there's a lot of people that were really pissed
[1584.92s -> 1589.24s]  off about that. So I'm glad. What do you mean don't let them in? There is. Don't let this guy in.
[1590.52s -> 1601.08s]  Oh, there's too many people on the elevator. I can't. All right. We have to get this way.
[1602.52s -> 1610.07s]  Bang. Bingo. Boink. How do you reload? I don't have any bullets left. Run. We have no other
[1610.07s -> 1616.68s]  bullets yet. Oh, that guy's got a pipe. How do you, how do you dash? I don't think there is one.
[1617.85s -> 1629.27s]  Definitely. That's our cue to get the hell out of here. Oh, it's space. Space? What do you mean
[1629.27s -> 1637.03s]  space? Hold space. Oh, that's weird. Okay. I feel like this is somebody pretending to run.
[1637.03s -> 1640.39s]  It's not somebody actually running. Okay. That actually
[1641.34s -> 1656.66s]  reminds me after this cut scene, I'll show you. Dude, does like security guards actually have this
[1656.66s -> 1661.53s]  many screens? Yeah, I think so. Are those two people who've been banned from your channel?
[1665.67s -> 1671.98s]  Let us back in. I promise. I promise. I won't ask to see your shit filled diaper again. I promise.
[1674.55s -> 1680.87s]  Get him. Get him, Marge. Leon, it's too late. We can do.
[1680.87s -> 1690.02s]  Or space twice when you're aimed in. Okay. Oh, I was explicitly told to not talk about diapers.
[1690.02s -> 1695.51s]  Explicitly. Yeah. Like, I'm not even kidding. Probably at least three or four people. Get the
[1695.51s -> 1701.90s]  hell out of here. You must have struck a nerve. I just was told don't do that. It's like fucking
[1701.90s -> 1711.26s]  weird. It's been at least, at least three people have told me that. All right. Pause for a sec.
[1711.90s -> 1715.86s]  Okay. I need turn sensitivity like. Yes. All the way down.
[1715.86s -> 1721.45s]  Somebody said you can, if you double tap space. What the hell are you doing? Oh, it's like a dodge.
[1721.45s -> 1730.55s]  Oh, holy shit. What? Are you seeing this? I can't focus on the settings because I'm stupid.
[1731.75s -> 1736.02s]  This is like the easiest way to get a bunch of like splinters all over your body.
[1737.11s -> 1744.39s]  Okay, that's cool. I wonder, do we share stuff on the ground? I wonder.
[1744.63s -> 1751.59s]  Oh, yeah, I can see that from my perspective. All right. Do we share what? Do we share items
[1751.59s -> 1754.31s]  like on the ground? Because I just picked up ammo and if there's no ammo on the ground,
[1754.31s -> 1769.86s]  then this is bad. Oh, look. Control settings. Can I break boxes? I don't think so. Is it camera
[1769.86s -> 1776.81s]  speed? It's, yeah. Camera speed is, and then there's aim speed too. Aim speed? Okay. Aim
[1776.81s -> 1780.49s]  speed is when you're aimed down sights and camera speed is just you walking around. There we go.
[1780.49s -> 1783.85s]  And if you put it at zero, don't worry. It's every video game ever made.
[1784.49s -> 1790.09s]  It's still horrible. You have to go, you have to go from zero to two out of sometimes potentially
[1790.09s -> 1797.51s]  a hundred. I still don't understand why that's a thing. All right. It is a PC video game.
[1798.86s -> 1804.49s]  Double tap space when not aiming. My run looks like I'm about to like go on stage at a Broadway.
[1806.55s -> 1810.39s]  Okay. Now I think you have to be, okay. So when you're aiming, if you hold the direction in
[1810.39s -> 1822.87s]  space, you'll dive and then you can get back up. All right. You ready? Overly complex, but yep.
[1824.95s -> 1833.08s]  Wait, hold on. Oh shit. That's actually kind of cool. Why do people say this is the worst one?
[1833.72s -> 1845.10s]  Jump down the stairs. They need to bring back the matrix games. I think they just kind of,
[1845.82s -> 1851.82s]  they overdid it with every video game having like a jump slow down that ever it just became
[1852.06s -> 1858.44s]  taboo to ever do it again. Even I have items too. I feel like we're just skipping everything.
[1858.44s -> 1861.56s]  Oh yeah. You got, you picked up the ammo. I didn't get any, you didn't get any ammo. Oh,
[1861.56s -> 1866.36s]  that's not good. Unless, uh, unless I just didn't look where you look about this.
[1869.05s -> 1873.69s]  We break the stuff. Bad feeling about this. Is that, is that the, be honest,
[1873.69s -> 1878.78s]  is that the voice actor for Levi? I don't know. It might be. Is that the, is that the,
[1879.58s -> 1883.82s]  I'm not going to do it because it's, it's hollowed ground, but uh, you know, the potentials there
[1884.38s -> 1887.18s]  to do like to do captain Levi from attack on Titan.
[1892.63s -> 1901.05s]  Don't you fucking dare to get that into my blood. How dare you do that. There's two things that
[1901.05s -> 1906.39s]  you were told when we in the private discord together is do not mention attack on Titan,
[1906.39s -> 1909.27s]  especially any of the main characters. That was one of the things that, and you, and you did,
[1909.27s -> 1913.58s]  you clicked, you did like the thumbs up emote on the fucking text on discord too. So I know you
[1913.58s -> 1926.81s]  saw it. Where we go? We got to go to, we got to go to class. Oh, press E while aiming. Sorry.
[1926.81s -> 1938.74s]  Oh shit. You can do double pistol. Why would we be hiding? Oh, somebody fell asleep on the stream
[1938.74s -> 1950.31s]  again. Oh, dual welding. Yep. Dual welding. I'm just picking up all the ammo. Is that,
[1950.31s -> 1954.63s]  I hope you're not mad about that. Uh, I got ammo on that one. Do you get ammo on this guy?
[1955.43s -> 1959.11s]  Those skill points. Do you get skill points on this guy? I think there actually is skills
[1959.11s -> 1962.89s]  in this game. I really do. Wait, do we have like a, do we have like a tree?
[1963.61s -> 1966.57s]  I actually think we do. All right. So what, we're in the wrong place here.
[1967.21s -> 1974.33s]  Resident sleeper six. Yep. It made it is good one chat. No, that, that actually is a good one
[1974.33s -> 1982.01s]  because this one is the worst one. Was that probably just ambient sound effect. Oh, I thought the
[1982.01s -> 1990.25s]  soda machine just broke. I was okay. All right. You know what? Can I just talk about how stupid
[1990.25s -> 1999.66s]  video games are? We can just walk over that. Help me. I've wasted so much ammo. I don't know why.
[1999.66s -> 2004.86s]  How do you do a wheel? Why can't we just walk over this? Video games are dumb. I hate them.
[2008.71s -> 2019.26s]  Look out. I have to stop fucking around because I'm seriously going to not have enough. You shoot
[2019.26s -> 2022.78s]  for, okay, you're going to have to shoot for another hour because I just used an hour of ammo.
[2024.22s -> 2029.02s]  Please do good because that was probably the next 45 minutes of in-game ammo.
[2032.82s -> 2038.31s]  What's the melee button? Uh, you've got a knife. I think you can just do the,
[2038.47s -> 2042.92s]  I've got a shotgun. Wait, why do you have a shotgun? Because we're different people.
[2042.92s -> 2047.48s]  Okay. You don't, you don't have to be like me. Well, you get a shotgun and I get a knife. Oh,
[2047.48s -> 2051.96s]  it's because I've paid for Capcom plus. Yeah. Yeah. I, by the way, I know you still were paying
[2051.96s -> 2058.25s]  for that. Uh-huh. Go ahead. Everybody tell you can, it's a confession here. Go ahead. Tell them.
[2059.21s -> 2067.61s]  I am still paying for Ubisoft plus. I forgot to cancel it and I still paid less for far cry than
[2067.61s -> 2075.56s]  you did. But I didn't look like a geek with all the, I paid for the items shit. So who really won?
[2078.15s -> 2086.62s]  Oh my God. I had like, help. I have neon. I have neon armor. Are you really, are you going to help
[2086.62s -> 2094.09s]  me with a knife? Holy shit. Okay. Wait, there's herbs. Don't forget to pick those up. I got them.
[2094.09s -> 2098.41s]  Do you want me to craft you a heel? Um, what's like the, is it an eye? How do you get to the
[2098.41s -> 2106.30s]  inventory? E. Okay. What the fuck is this inventory? I don't know how to scroll over.
[2106.30s -> 2111.83s]  How do you go down? Oh, it's mouse wheel. Okay. Mouse wheel and what's on the, what's down the
[2111.83s -> 2116.71s]  bottom? What's all this weird shit here? It's probably like, uh, actual usables. Oh, okay.
[2116.71s -> 2124.87s]  Like materials up top, full product down below. Um, all right. That's probably the, I really
[2124.87s -> 2132.06s]  don't want to be like a dick or anything. And I hate to say this. This is 2012. It was a different
[2132.06s -> 2137.34s]  time. They were doing the resident evils had the same UIs since like fucking 1996. So I don't buy
[2137.34s -> 2146.17s]  that. They were trying to get creative. They wanted everything to be in game. This is a fucking
[2146.17s -> 2150.81s]  horizontal metal gear, solid inventory and a holy shit. I hate that inventory system. I'm sorry.
[2152.07s -> 2156.23s]  Oh yeah. No, it's bad. It's bad. You got any dual wield? Okay. How do you do that?
[2157.03s -> 2161.51s]  Just a melee. Holy shit. I said a diamond cutter to somebody. I literally just RKO that person.
[2161.51s -> 2172.52s]  What? That was awesome. Yeah. Do it again. Um, no reason for me to waste any ammo.
[2173.56s -> 2178.28s]  That metal gear. So it was an amazing game. I just, I don't like the inventory.
[2179.00s -> 2188.84s]  This is a three shot double barrel shotgun. No, it's a triple barrel shotgun. Oh, incendiary
[2188.84s -> 2202.15s]  grenade. Cool. Go to the security gate. It'll lead you off the campus. Go. Resident evil five is the
[2202.15s -> 2210.81s]  Mona Lisa of video games compared to this. Um, well when Mona Lisa of video games,
[2211.29s -> 2215.61s]  but when you have to understand something, this is like, this is the same tier of games that come
[2215.61s -> 2222.06s]  in the cereal box. So that's not fair. Well, you can say, he said, first of all, I want to know.
[2222.06s -> 2225.26s]  I've seen Mona Lisa in real life and honestly, it wasn't that impressive.
[2226.22s -> 2234.22s]  It's smaller than you think. What the fuck? Yeah. Okay. There's like a spam button. Uh,
[2234.22s -> 2252.41s]  PT. Sorry. Does that hit me? Yeah. Body is falling apart. And I actually can, I want that.
[2252.97s -> 2258.97s]  And I picked that up. The sledgehammer that just disappeared. No, I don't think you can.
[2258.97s -> 2263.61s]  That's an unforgivable sin in video games when there's items that people are using and you can't
[2263.61s -> 2274.30s]  have them. You've just played too much, uh, dead rising. It was unforgivable. If there's a swinging
[2274.30s -> 2278.14s]  animation that the character is using and that falls on the ground, it's an actual, its own object.
[2278.14s -> 2285.34s]  It's a piece, it's a placement of graphical input, unity, whatever it is. If it was made with unity.
[2285.34s -> 2289.58s]  No, I'm just saying like if it's in the engine, then why can't I use it?
[2292.02s -> 2299.94s]  I want to fight with balloons and this flagpole. Why can't I use that? Graphical and input unity.
[2302.63s -> 2321.67s]  Graphical input user. How do I get to the grenade? Is this a college? G? It's not G. Does it not look
[2321.67s -> 2326.55s]  like I am doing some kind of like stage dance when I run? Okay. You stand, no, no, stand right
[2326.55s -> 2330.94s]  there at the door, but like turn around. I can't. I can see everything you're doing though. Okay.
[2330.94s -> 2340.02s]  Hold on. Am I, am I off screen? You are off screen stage left for me. Okay. Hold on. Does
[2340.02s -> 2344.98s]  it's like the, the motion of my arms, not. You just look like you're running around.
[2349.88s -> 2354.36s]  I'm so patiently waiting for you at the door. I'm just looking. I see everything you're doing,
[2354.36s -> 2358.36s]  but I'm not going to acknowledge it for some reason. This is so normal that I'm just going
[2358.36s -> 2363.90s]  to give you a minute and then you're eventually going to come over here. Okay. That was very
[2363.90s -> 2369.93s]  normal. Keep that trigger finger ready. Okay. There were no, what's around the next corner.
[2369.93s -> 2378.66s]  Wait. Okay. Ammo. We stopped doing that. We need those to like distract them. No,
[2378.66s -> 2382.98s]  cause we're, this is a fighting hall. We're going to try the door. Something's going to be jammed.
[2382.98s -> 2386.10s]  We're going to turn around. They're all going to come to life and we have to fight out the door.
[2386.10s -> 2398.87s]  So Alex, it's just going to open. Watch. Oh yeah. Then again, the door's locked. I told you I called
[2398.87s -> 2406.50s]  this a hundred percent. That's corner pocket. All right. This is, which is, this is just literally
[2406.50s -> 2410.66s]  like left for dead right now. All right. Skill points. Just wait till they come in. Who cares?
[2410.66s -> 2414.66s]  Don't even shoot. Actually, we probably should shoot them. I mean, yeah, they're going to,
[2414.66s -> 2423.38s]  they're going to commit. How was it? You half your head has gone. Wait till they get in at
[2423.38s -> 2430.17s]  least so you can get skill points. Just threw a bottle at me. The melee is better than shooting
[2430.17s -> 2437.50s]  a gun. I'm just telling you. I'm tripping over their body.
[2442.30s -> 2450.94s]  The Bailey's better. I have a shotgun. If I can upgrade this, I will. Why am I just falling down?
[2453.29s -> 2456.57s]  Okay. But an FOV is actually pretty bad. That person just,
[2457.45s -> 2461.43s]  okay. So this is what you're talking about. The X pick up the X and you pick it up.
[2461.51s -> 2471.13s]  Wow. Sick wrestling move. You're going to die?
[2474.57s -> 2480.65s]  What just happened? Did you just kill me? You just hit me in the face with something.
[2480.65s -> 2487.37s]  What'd you hit me with? You shot me in the head. You shot me directly in the face.
[2489.13s -> 2491.77s]  I'm dead again. What's happening? Where's my health meter?
[2492.25s -> 2498.94s]  You died again. But wait, we're dead. What? I feel like this is an arcade game we've put coins into.
[2498.94s -> 2507.24s]  It's like deliberately shitty and bad and hard. We'll find out where the checkpoint is,
[2507.24s -> 2513.21s]  I guess. Oh, it's right here. It's right here. Keep that trigger finger ready.
[2513.21s -> 2520.10s]  Know what's around the next corner. Oh, foreshadowing. By the way, that's totally
[2521.72s -> 2531.67s]  Levi. Probably is. There's a stamina meter. Okay. So the right top bar is health and the bar
[2531.67s -> 2534.39s]  underneath that is stamina. All right. We know what this does. Let's skip this.
[2536.97s -> 2542.84s]  We can't skip this. We have to live it. And again, the door's locked. There's no way out.
[2546.15s -> 2550.95s]  Zombies don't know how to do that. I'm it's so dumb. Like zombies that like dodge,
[2550.95s -> 2554.47s]  like juke a bullet gun shooting at them. It's like that's stupid.
[2559.18s -> 2562.78s]  I don't know. Maybe the first 45 minutes. Okay. Well, prepare yourself.
[2563.74s -> 2569.38s]  Are you prepared? What's that from? I don't know. Oh, you didn't play any of those.
[2573.19s -> 2586.20s]  Yes. You're right. Yeah, I'm good. We probably should like just stay back.
[2586.84s -> 2591.46s]  Just stay back here. You're too close. They're surrounding you right now.
[2591.46s -> 2595.86s]  It's surrounding the cool melee. We just have to live. We're in veteran. You made us do this.
[2596.58s -> 2600.10s]  Yeah, it's not even that hard. Okay. I'm not the one that died. How do I throw a grenade?
[2600.98s -> 2608.02s]  Holy shit. What the hell happened? Her head. But her head like melted off. You like slowly
[2608.02s -> 2613.74s]  simmered her head until it came off. That was like, like a tender like pork roast.
[2614.78s -> 2623.99s]  All right. You got, you got it. Reload it. Concentrate.
[2625.93s -> 2635.51s]  Kill points. It's like actually a hundred lootables on the ground.
[2635.51s -> 2641.99s]  Yeah, I know. Get rid of the Diablo to this. Nope. What? Sorry. You wanted all that stuff.
[2641.99s -> 2646.15s]  Oh my God. Are you kidding me? What am I supposed to do?
[2646.95s -> 2658.26s]  I think you just WASD really fast. I want to throw the grenade.
[2658.26s -> 2662.18s]  Fortified windows of that hallway could not hold them. This single wooden plank will.
[2662.18s -> 2667.30s]  What the fuck? How? Why can I not? I don't know how to pick up the grenade.
[2669.48s -> 2677.72s]  Define pickup. Like it's in your pocket already. It's F. What the fuck? First A. Oh, okay.
[2680.76s -> 2684.94s]  All right. So I have it. Cool. How do you like, we need to get the key card.
[2686.39s -> 2694.36s]  Yeah. How do you equip a heel? Oh, you have to manually do it. Press E. And then click it.
[2695.56s -> 2701.56s]  Combine with R for some God forsaken reason. Well, because you, one of each color is a mega
[2701.56s -> 2712.17s]  herb. So combine this with, I'll do this with red. So that's a, I made a six. All right.
[2713.51s -> 2719.99s]  You also then have to highlight the herb. Yeah. Press space, then press space again to store it
[2719.99s -> 2728.12s]  in your case. And then once it's stored in your case, then I don't know. It's gone. It's there
[2728.12s -> 2734.49s]  though. I was just, I almost just threw away bullets. All right. Um, there's also like,
[2734.49s -> 2741.37s]  you can hold Q to turn the entire game. Press one. Oh, what the fuck dude? Don't say that. I
[2741.37s -> 2745.37s]  just made an herb. Why did you say, what are you doing? Don't tell me to do that. What the fuck?
[2746.17s -> 2755.03s]  Are you healthy now? I, I already was. I'm not pressing two. There's something here. Oh,
[2757.13s -> 2765.53s]  free stuff. There's a key over this way somewhere. Oh, nice. Not alive. They changed.
[2766.25s -> 2772.02s]  They changed it. When's the next rock out break? I just want to chill. Um, this is not a thing.
[2772.02s -> 2777.45s]  This is not something you can pick up. I just opened this drawer. That looks like an item that
[2777.45s -> 2780.73s]  you put in a door resident evil style. Right? Why, what, what is it? Why can't we not
[2781.70s -> 2786.95s]  collect serpent? I just broke it. Oh, that's the thing you destroy and you eventually get to
[2786.95s -> 2794.95s]  unlock stuff. Okay. Okay. I don't do the rock outs anymore. The last time I did it,
[2795.75s -> 2799.91s]  the rock outs. Yeah. Just like, I used to do this thing where I would just like put a song on and
[2799.91s -> 2804.92s]  like air drum and shit, but people thought it was like we could cringy and I got a lot of shit for
[2804.92s -> 2811.56s]  it. So what are you doing down there? What the fuck was that? Oh, okay. There was a zombie in
[2811.56s -> 2819.45s]  this room. I, I just stabbed. I just stabbed him in the face. Why am I? It'd be nice if I had a
[2819.45s -> 2827.64s]  heel. That'd be fantastic. Oh my fucking God. Whatever. Okay. So we're looking for a, uh,
[2827.64s -> 2833.82s]  we have to escape now. We're going to go this way through the fridge, through the refrigerator,
[2836.28s -> 2841.62s]  secret trap door fridge. Nope. You hold Q, you hold Q. Yeah. You get, you get a little thing where
[2841.62s -> 2849.75s]  it shows you where to go. Nice try. Nice try. Their bodies are still physical objects even
[2849.75s -> 2855.53s]  after they're dead. So hang on. No, I didn't touch them. Resident evil does the thing.
[2857.91s -> 2862.95s]  He's going to get you. Shoot him. Thank you. Well, you call it out. What have you ever played a first
[2862.95s -> 2869.46s]  person? You go loading, you go reloading. E3 has already happened. I don't think they're going to
[2869.46s -> 2873.22s]  do the Ubisoft thing on the game awards. That's literally the worst thing they put in the game.
[2873.22s -> 2877.22s]  It's like the, the like super smash brothers brawl trip that they put in here for no reason.
[2877.86s -> 2894.57s]  Why is it in the game? What? All right. What is happening? Comic book falls. I felt like I had
[2894.57s -> 2901.14s]  so many times. Yeah. It's resident evil. I'm just going to be spamming R like, look, it's just
[2901.14s -> 2907.38s]  hit our, our, our, our, our. Nice try. Cause this skill points on the ground.
[2909.14s -> 2913.38s]  It's the room we were just in before, right? We can pick this stuff up. Yeah. Did you,
[2913.38s -> 2916.10s]  did you not, while we were walking back through, I kind of wait a minute. So you,
[2916.10s -> 2921.45s]  so you picked everything up already. You see a single thing on the ground. No, I did. So I
[2921.45s -> 2924.97s]  think we do have separate stuff. What if, what if, what if one of us picks it up and it gives it to
[2924.97s -> 2930.86s]  both of us, but also I have a shotgun. So you're not going to get like a shotgun ammo. I love
[2930.86s -> 2935.34s]  sandwiches like this, like the triangle sandwiches at like a party. Did you know
[2935.34s -> 2939.26s]  that all sandwiches can be triangles? If you just, if you just cut them the right way in half.
[2939.26s -> 2943.27s]  Yeah, but that's fine. But I'm saying I like when it's that style.
[2944.30s -> 2947.82s]  I did not, I did not purpose that by saying all sandwiches are triangles.
[2949.18s -> 2953.18s]  Yeah. But you said I love this kind of sandwich. Like you could have that every time.
[2953.18s -> 2960.20s]  Yeah. But it's a kind of pain in the ass sandwiches do taste better if you cut them in half though.
[2960.20s -> 2970.23s]  No, I hit you. They're very good. I love sandwiches. Sandwiches like probably one of my top three.
[2970.95s -> 2983.78s]  What are you doing? You still over there? I can't see what's going on behind me.
[2983.78s -> 2991.85s]  I just know that you're in some trouble. I'm just a one V wanting the strongest blue collar
[2991.85s -> 2998.50s]  zombie in the entire game. I can't, I actually can't get out of this. Oh, there we go. There is a
[2998.50s -> 3010.18s]  stamina. What about what are your top sandwich shapes? Um, sub role probably number one. Sure.
[3011.27s -> 3018.65s]  I'd say also up at S tier is it's a euro a sandwich. Um, yeah, probably. Okay. Probably
[3018.65s -> 3026.47s]  for this argument, maybe you just walk through a metal detector. Well, we're going to put our
[3026.47s -> 3030.55s]  weapons in there. We can't like, you have to go through it. Oh, we got to run. Oh,
[3035.91s -> 3040.87s]  that's what I was getting. This game does the thing like an unforgivable survival horror sin,
[3041.99s -> 3046.79s]  where there's people who you think are not alive. Oh my God. That guy hit me in the fucking head
[3046.79s -> 3052.15s]  with that axe. Why does my entire screen go white and blue when that happens? What is going on with
[3052.15s -> 3058.78s]  me? But that's when you got hit. I don't know what happened. I got hit with an accident. Am I dead?
[3062.79s -> 3066.95s]  Are we like symbiotically linked or something? Why? Why do I feel your pain? Because my entire
[3066.95s -> 3071.83s]  screen flashes white and blue and it happens to you. I don't know. Is this specific rimming
[3071.83s -> 3079.13s]  right now? Are we, are we, uh, getting drift compatible? I need to heal. I have a red,
[3080.09s -> 3090.71s]  I still don't understand what I'm looking at here. Okay. All right. This is the third,
[3090.71s -> 3095.11s]  that was the third try. They give you zombies on the ground, but you're not allowed to shoot them
[3095.11s -> 3101.03s]  until the game lets you. Oh, I see what you mean. Right. The play dead zombies, but you could in a
[3101.03s -> 3105.75s]  bunch of other survival horror games, you can, if you shoot them, they go and die. Yeah. Yeah.
[3106.71s -> 3113.30s]  I feel like we've been watching the trailer for this game the whole time we've been playing.
[3114.26s -> 3124.90s]  I feel like we haven't started playing. It's a long trailer. Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[3126.34s -> 3134.25s]  What the fuck? Oh, he was a fucking hunter from left for dead. I don't know how many more of these
[3134.25s -> 3138.57s]  I have. I have an unlimited number. I need to eat more of these like pills.
[3140.89s -> 3155.96s]  How much do I have to eat? Wait, I have a grenade. What's the grenade button again? F.
[3156.76s -> 3167.13s]  All right. Watch out. What the fuck, dude? I'm dead again. I think you're shooting me with the
[3167.13s -> 3173.30s]  shotgun. I did a kick. I did like a melee to try to help you. The top bar is your health.
[3174.26s -> 3184.12s]  Don't shoot me, please. Watch out behind you. Do I have any more pills?
[3189.64s -> 3203.82s]  Just go, go, go, go, go. Just go, go, go. You all right? Oh, that was a big, that was a big
[3203.82s -> 3207.74s]  jumping somersault to make it to the car in time. How do I drive?
[3208.46s -> 3214.82s]  Are you sure? I'm looking for the keys to the car. Yeah, find the keys. They're breaking in.
[3216.20s -> 3221.16s]  They're not in the glove box. Why is this door the fucking explorer? Like, where are they?
[3224.12s -> 3226.68s]  You turn the windshield wipers on? Are they? Look up, look up.
[3228.76s -> 3237.22s]  Gamers never look up. Oh my god. I can't help you. I am a spectator in this hellscape.
[3237.22s -> 3252.30s]  We drove, we drove 10 feet. Oh my god. All right, everyone's buckled. Can I drive the car?
[3252.86s -> 3262.95s]  I'm like in the, I'm like above the middle console right now. I just got to get through town.
[3262.95s -> 3267.91s]  Made it off campus. This is actually like a realistic college simulator. It's the RA.
[3274.07s -> 3282.71s]  Okay, so that was, that was fun. We're dead. Shit. What are you doing, man? Don't put the
[3282.71s -> 3286.31s]  bong under the covers. What if he looks at your bed? Helena, are you two all right?
[3286.31s -> 3293.45s]  All right, hang on, hang on. We need another way to the cathedral. How do we get out of here?
[3295.45s -> 3304.47s]  Turn on subtitles. Did that work? And then the really funny thing happens where like,
[3304.47s -> 3308.71s]  I took a huge hit from the bong before. I thought you were gonna say shit.
[3309.91s -> 3314.39s]  Yeah, I took a huge shit before the RA comes in. Oh my god, it's cleaning day.
[3314.39s -> 3317.83s]  No, it's cleaning day. There's a huge shit. I can't flush it. We have to go to,
[3317.83s -> 3323.91s]  you're disgusting. Stop it. Um, like the comedy movie thing where like I take a huge bong rip
[3323.91s -> 3328.25s]  and like the RA knock, knock, knock at the door and then I have to hold that in because like,
[3328.25s -> 3332.82s]  oh my god, what if the comedy smoke will come out of my mouth and will he'll know?
[3332.82s -> 3336.90s]  And then you do like a huge guffaw like, like right after they leave.
[3336.90s -> 3352.81s]  Yep. You stole that joke. Okay. Every joke is stolen. It's called life experience.
[3352.81s -> 3359.24s]  What's the matter? You stole that.
[3364.58s -> 3370.47s]  Matthew Mercer is the voice of Leon here. Yeah, it's him. It's been confirmed.
[3390.15s -> 3393.91s]  I would want, I do gotta have some shades there. I hate that when the sun's just beaming through.
[3394.15s -> 3400.33s]  You gotta get the glasses that have both little flip ups.
[3401.85s -> 3409.40s]  Holy shit, it would suck to be in this room. Yeah, honestly, they need to fix the electricity
[3409.40s -> 3418.47s]  in the White House. This is unacceptable. Natural lighting only. He's old enough,
[3418.47s -> 3422.39s]  but he would definitely be one of those like, turn the lights on or you're going to like
[3422.39s -> 3427.43s]  burn your eyes out trying to read that book. You know, my fucking dad's stuff.
[3428.15s -> 3435.51s]  Natural lighting is based. Yeah, that's what every magazine told you. And then you actually
[3435.51s -> 3440.71s]  have it. And once you get so much natural light into a room and like your head hurts.
[3440.71s -> 3447.05s]  Let's get moving. We don't have much time. Certainly got our work cut out for us.
[3447.05s -> 3451.53s]  Oh, halogen lamps only. I know. No, I'm not those either.
[3452.49s -> 3456.74s]  Florescence. I have just like those, you know, those like fluorescent bulbs that the long tubes.
[3457.70s -> 3459.06s]  Yeah, you know, the ones that go
[3463.27s -> 3474.86s]  Yeah, no, they're all of my whole movie lights. Yes. I like my house to maintain the abandoned
[3474.86s -> 3479.50s]  warehouse. Look, we'll be at a contact. I know exactly what you mean. Actually, I need heels,
[3479.50s -> 3489.02s]  but be careful. Oh, hold on. I think I figured it out. So the the number of the dots that are on
[3489.02s -> 3495.64s]  the herb is how many times you can take the pill, right? Is it? I think that's what that means.
[3495.64s -> 3502.86s]  He finally gets it. This is a dumb feature. Yeah, like, okay, the number at the bottom
[3502.86s -> 3509.34s]  right with the green leap. What's what's your number? Zero. I have nine. You do? Uh huh.
[3509.34s -> 3517.13s]  Can I have one? Yeah. Can we actually trade or no? I was about to unload the whole clip into your
[3517.13s -> 3526.62s]  head. All right. Let's we need to go to the cathedral. Taking the train to church. There
[3526.62s -> 3534.07s]  is no sprint. Yeah, you're right. There's no sprint. I'm just I'm just like twice as fast as you
[3534.07s -> 3538.87s]  deal with that zombie. How do I do it? What's sprint? It's space. Why is it space? That's right.
[3538.87s -> 3546.02s]  Why is it space? Why? Why is it space? Exactly what I just sounded like. And I did that for a
[3546.02s -> 3550.34s]  funny comedic joke thing. So you got it. Chad voice. Watch out. Watch out.
[3551.54s -> 3562.54s]  You got to save bullets. Watch out behind you. Watch out. Actually, let's just keep going.
[3563.34s -> 3565.18s]  Yeah. Why? There's no reason to stop. There really isn't.
[3566.14s -> 3573.02s]  All right. How do you heal? One. It'll take one pill and you can take one pip. You heal. You heal
[3573.02s -> 3579.08s]  one pip at a time and I think you can just spam it. Oh, there's a train coming by the way.
[3580.76s -> 3581.72s]  Space plus R.
[3590.12s -> 3595.72s]  I was hitting space and D. Space and R. What is it? What do you mean R? Why is it? Oh, that's
[3595.72s -> 3603.13s]  reload. I don't think I got it either. I think it just clipped you first. Space and hold on.
[3603.13s -> 3610.47s]  That's the canon ending. The thing is, isn't space and D dive? Why is it space and R? All right,
[3610.47s -> 3620.22s]  just run. How do you tell like this story by the way, like Leon, the professional zombie hunter?
[3620.94s -> 3630.31s]  All right. Space plus R. I swear to God, I did it. I actually did it. I don't get it.
[3630.95s -> 3638.71s]  It's because I have the script. I have to tell that story. Helena is a survivor in one of these
[3638.71s -> 3646.71s]  timelines. You go find your family. Oh, okay. Well, you do it. You do it. I did do it. Space
[3646.71s -> 3653.85s]  and R. And I think my script that I have is fucking up this whole thing. Okay. Space and R.
[3656.01s -> 3664.78s]  Okay. I got it. I was doing like space then R. No, I wasn't doing it at the same exact time. I
[3664.78s -> 3672.58s]  tried to, but dying restores your health. Oh shit. It actually does. That's a strat.
[3672.58s -> 3683.96s]  There's a zombie dog. Where? Dead, dead ahead. Oh, well, do we know if it's friendly?
[3684.76s -> 3702.20s]  It's got red eyes. He could be barking at somebody behind us. I, okay. Yeah. Oh my
[3702.20s -> 3710.94s]  jeez. He's probably barking at the train. Okay. What do we do with the skill point stuff?
[3713.29s -> 3718.09s]  I have no idea. Why are you guys doing this? They're attacking us. It's like a mutated zombie
[3718.09s -> 3725.93s]  dog. I did it. I released the pathogen. Well, who's something going on here? Why are there
[3725.93s -> 3729.69s]  so many people in the subway? That's the question. Oh fuck. I think I killed that guy.
[3733.13s -> 3746.34s]  What do you mean? There's a train. Oh my God. Okay. I don't, I think we, maybe we could have
[3746.34s -> 3752.30s]  saved that. All right. You have so much health. Let me take this one. Take what? Get high. You
[3752.30s -> 3759.50s]  guys should get high. No. Is that why they have so many herbs? Well, they want me to be high,
[3759.50s -> 3764.46s]  like in play. And I, I have, but I have sworn that off forever. Ever since I couldn't read the
[3764.46s -> 3776.14s]  analog clock on camera. Oh, good shot. Why is that one on fire? I think, uh, yeah, I think we have
[3776.14s -> 3782.78s]  to turn that off. Um, what, what happened? What did I just get hit with? They're throwing shit.
[3782.78s -> 3786.62s]  What do you mean they throw shit? They just get stuck and then they throw their, look, they
[3786.62s -> 3791.42s]  throw it again. You just hit the guy in front of them. Well, they're going to, we don't even
[3791.42s -> 3802.81s]  waste ammo on the guys in the back. Cool stuff. I'm just trying to conserve ammo because I'm
[3802.81s -> 3809.42s]  terrible. Oh, you can. Oh, so if they have a weapon, you do it for your finish move. It's,
[3809.42s -> 3813.82s]  I want to carry it around. So how do we, I'm so sorry. How do we turn that off? I thought
[3813.82s -> 3817.58s]  that was in the game. Was that, that wasn't in the game. That was a coffee leg kick up. Uh,
[3818.54s -> 3826.10s]  I think I, do we destroy it? I can't tell. I don't know. Co-op moment up here. Can I reach this
[3826.10s -> 3839.32s]  with the range? I think. Yeah, I can. I, I don't know why I don't know this about this game. I
[3839.32s -> 3844.86s]  feel like we still not playing the game yet. That's probably because we did not see the prologue or
[3844.86s -> 3853.80s]  the first cut scene. Is that explode? That's a red barrel. See, look, this, this is a pretend zombie
[3853.80s -> 3858.92s]  over on the wall. Yeah, I know. And we can't exactly see him now. You're right. Yeah, that's,
[3858.92s -> 3869.22s]  that's stupid. Was there anything in this? No. Yeah, I had something. Uh, use your knife so you
[3869.22s -> 3876.23s]  don't waste, uh, bullets. I don't have a knife. I have, uh. Okay. Come on. Are there items here for
[3876.23s -> 3885.83s]  you? Yeah. Okay. So we, we, we do both get our own stuff. Is there a train here? You go first.
[3887.19s -> 3890.87s]  It is, it is a rail. Yeah, but I don't know if it's going to be an immediate. Oh, there's a secret.
[3891.90s -> 3900.23s]  Is there? All right. I got it. I got this. All right. So we're a hundred percent in this or else,
[3901.03s -> 3915.69s]  how many gifts ups? Um, zero. Careful. Okay. I'll give you a, I'll give you zero gifts. So do you
[3915.69s -> 3921.46s]  just see how far you can get over the electricity? No, I don't know. No gift subs. No gifts. That was
[3921.46s -> 3932.49s]  the point. Yeah. Is it zero shadows? Yeah. Do you have grenades? Oh, I don't moving in humanly fast.
[3932.49s -> 3937.45s]  And I, I mean, even for like zombies. They are. All right. Is there a barrel? Does that explode?
[3938.17s -> 3943.99s]  All right. I think we just have to run, take out the first. Yeah. We just run, just run, run, run,
[3943.99s -> 3955.91s]  run. They are really good at predicting movement. Are you good? Oh, you don't look good. Are you good?
[3962.07s -> 3966.71s]  Are you good? I'm good. I'm just waiting. You're most grumpy. I'm not a grub. What are you talking
[3966.71s -> 3969.99s]  about? I'm very, I'm happy right now. This is train coming, train coming, which would from its
[3969.99s -> 3975.43s]  wrecking. It's behind us. It's behind us. It's behind us. I didn't get a prompt. What?
[3976.15s -> 3979.99s]  I think you have to be looking at it or no, you get to be on the other side of the track.
[3979.99s -> 3991.83s]  There's two tracks. Where's the prompt? Oh, we didn't get a prompt. It's been giving us prompts.
[3991.83s -> 3999.88s]  Whatever. I was sitting there waiting with, I was, okay. I was hovering. I was hovering my hand over
[3999.88s -> 4004.44s]  space and are just ready to press it. Yeah. I was too. You're not going to get the collectible again.
[4005.24s -> 4015.21s]  Not even a real game. Oh, I thought, I thought we shared that. Okay. So now we just have to go to
[4015.21s -> 4018.81s]  the other side. Yeah. So just who cares? It's going to do the dumb puppet show where it shows
[4018.81s -> 4031.45s]  those scary things and we just run by it. This is a nightmare. I keep having this vision of you
[4031.45s -> 4039.38s]  getting splattered by a train at high speed. It trains on the other side. Yep. Okay. It's definitely
[4039.38s -> 4054.20s]  going to switch. So just stay in the middle. What happened? Why? I think you got caught in
[4054.20s -> 4063.11s]  between the cars. I did not. You went into the middle prematurely. Hold on. Too much air just
[4063.11s -> 4071.19s]  came out of my fucking mouth. It was so stupid. Honest to God, I'm not, what happened? I did not
[4071.19s -> 4077.72s]  even come close. The train was already by dude. I swear to God. It was like over halfway by.
[4078.44s -> 4091.03s]  That's so stupid. This game sucks. It's the cut scene trigger. Yep. But that's the best part.
[4092.07s -> 4096.87s]  But I did not understand the cut scene trigger was going to be here. Right? Like right on the
[4096.87s -> 4101.67s]  edge. The train is like a boss and you can touch the boss and you die. No, the hitbox is huge.
[4101.67s -> 4108.65s]  I'm telling you, just stay really far to the left. The hitbox is monumental. I want to know
[4108.65s -> 4112.57s]  what it looks like when I get hit by the train. You might see it because the hitbox is huge.
[4120.94s -> 4126.78s]  Okay. Now we can just, I thought it was going to happen again. I thought it happened to you.
[4127.50s -> 4142.92s]  Apparently this is our ride. Okay. Very good. Can't open it. We're not getting that open.
[4142.92s -> 4148.68s]  There's a illuminated latch on top. Boost me up on top. Somebody just said I've got stuck at this
[4148.68s -> 4157.00s]  part for 45 minutes. Good luck. I can't wait. What the hell did I shoot you? Yeah,
[4157.00s -> 4162.20s]  directly in the fucking back of the head. The shotgun spread is insane.
[4165.64s -> 4170.36s]  Also, I can't believe friendly fire is on by default. Okay. Are you going to boost me?
[4170.36s -> 4179.40s]  Hold on. I hate this inventory. It sucks. Okay. So click on this, say send to, how do I send this
[4179.40s -> 4183.72s]  to my? You send it to desktop and then you're going to want to right click, zip it, and then
[4183.72s -> 4193.22s]  email it to me. But how, how do I do that? You're a hater. I hate this game. Well, who can, yes.
[4198.36s -> 4206.17s]  It's space. Okay. How do I get up? I'm not grumpy. I hate this game. What, there's a difference.
[4206.17s -> 4210.25s]  I'm just kidding. I like this game. Okay. So there's, why can I not send this to my inventory?
[4210.81s -> 4221.83s]  It doesn't say I have one heel. Mannequins that are definitely come to life.
[4223.88s -> 4230.28s]  Open this. Did I just use keys? I think I have to wait for you. Yeah. As soon as I dropped in,
[4230.28s -> 4241.11s]  keep your car. Oh, nice. Here comes a rage stream. Watch out.
[4248.06s -> 4258.26s]  Maybe those ones are actually. I tell you guys that somebody said that they heard that in a game
[4259.24s -> 4263.72s]  and they like freaked out that sound. They heard that sound that I always do. And they were like,
[4263.72s -> 4268.68s]  it fucking ruined the whole game for me. I couldn't even play it again. What quiet screaming? No, the
[4274.06s -> 4277.66s]  you didn't. Why would you tell me that? That was, was that the whole story? Someone played a game.
[4277.66s -> 4284.74s]  They heard that noise and didn't play it again. Yes. No, why would you tell me? I'm talking to
[4284.74s -> 4295.46s]  all of you. Not the only person here at town is like 150,000 other people here.
[4299.21s -> 4309.94s]  Watch out. They like the meltdown animation. The sludge zombie. Yeah, that's crazy.
[4314.68s -> 4319.64s]  Be careful. Be careful. Give me, I need a minute. What are you guys talking about?
[4320.36s -> 4324.63s]  There's a raid. Are you lying to me? I can't. Probably the most realistic bit about this game
[4324.63s -> 4329.74s]  is you have to do everything on your phone. Is there actually a raid? I can't see it.
[4329.74s -> 4340.25s]  Mod. Tell me the raid. You know, that actually looks like, um, who is that actual raid right now?
[4340.25s -> 4348.89s]  I need a mod. Blade Runner 2049. Uh, Lala land. I don't know. I don't think there was. That's
[4348.89s -> 4357.50s]  Ryan Gosling. Okay. That's all right. I got, I got lied to. Tell me that's not Ryan Gosling.
[4357.50s -> 4363.38s]  I see, I see Jared Leto more than Ryan Gosling. Yeah, I see that too. It's the hair and the,
[4363.38s -> 4370.54s]  and the mustache, but the face is Ryan Gosling. What the fuck happened? The guy was camping with
[4370.54s -> 4383.00s]  an X. It's just, they're just gas lighting you. Okay. Because you're using this gas can.
[4383.80s -> 4391.62s]  That's my, that is my name. Yeah. I swear to God, this is going to turn on. Isn't it?
[4391.62s -> 4396.58s]  Here comes it. Are you ready? I'm ready for space R. The train's not turning on. I mean, it's on.
[4397.38s -> 4404.02s]  No, we're just going to have, this is actually the matrix subway station. So you got to do
[4405.83s -> 4413.83s]  the backwards. That's a, that's a person, right? I feel like I fell asleep on the couch like this
[4413.83s -> 4419.98s]  last night. And that's like my whole body hurts now. Like this is how I slept. I hate that. I
[4419.98s -> 4426.95s]  fell asleep before the stream woke up and I'm like, like you said, there's no chapter.
[4426.95s -> 4433.54s]  It's got like a bomb. We're in like an extended trailer for this game. How do you switch to bomb?
[4435.22s -> 4440.18s]  It's a weird combination in the inventory. I have no idea. Cause I can see it from mouse wheel.
[4440.18s -> 4449.08s]  It's like E then like F or something. E, E. You can throw it away. So be careful.
[4449.08s -> 4459.77s]  There's literally a way to destroy it. Oh, okay. It's F and then F, F. Oh my God. This sucks.
[4459.77s -> 4467.45s]  Asshole. F is scroll vertically. And what'd you just do? You just put down, get away. Don't you
[4467.45s -> 4474.60s]  dare. Don't do it. Well, can you pick it back up? This entire station hostage. Just pick it back up.
[4474.60s -> 4479.48s]  It's fine. As long as you don't press the button. Shoot me. My like death reflex may accidentally
[4479.48s -> 4485.50s]  trigger the bomb, but you don't know that. All right. He's dead.
[4486.94s -> 4490.62s]  No, now you have to heal. We did it where I'm veteran right now. No, you can't do like
[4490.62s -> 4508.02s]  comedy references. It's okay. I got some. I thought that was part of the cut scene.
[4509.62s -> 4520.89s]  Come on. We're going to pull this all open with our bare hands. Oh, you idiot. You idiot.
[4521.85s -> 4522.65s]  You idiot.
[4528.49s -> 4534.50s]  I didn't mean to use that many. Use it. Use a bomb. Yeah. Use a bomb. Somebody's
[4534.50s -> 4538.50s]  for something in my face. Watch out. There's like a spitter. Watch out. Plant a bomb.
[4539.46s -> 4550.52s]  All right. Watch out. Yep. I didn't even see it. Cool guys. Don't look at explosions. I saw it though.
[4550.52s -> 4569.16s]  It's very cool. They're alive. All right. The worst part is switching guns. The entire gun
[4569.24s -> 4577.45s]  inventory like crosses over the crosshair. Like if you mouse wheel while you're aiming down sights.
[4578.41s -> 4584.17s]  I mean you can just say it. You can just say it. It's this game is actually not as bad as
[4584.17s -> 4590.09s]  everyone said it was. It's awful, but I would not give this an F. I'd give it like a D so far.
[4594.33s -> 4600.58s]  I would never. I would never recommend this game to my friends, but like if somebody. Yeah.
[4601.30s -> 4606.02s]  As far as like co-op games though, there's just a lot of. You can reach the street level from there.
[4606.02s -> 4610.42s]  What are conditions like up there? It's the worst Resident Evil game. It's gotten pretty bad.
[4610.42s -> 4616.26s]  If you don't like this by yourself. Yeah. This is not a game I would play solo Resident Evil.
[4616.26s -> 4624.65s]  Oh, let me turn you up. But like that. A person using the turnstile and then just leaping. Yeah.
[4624.65s -> 4629.43s]  It's fucked up. That's good content. I have no idea. I don't even know what you just said. I
[4629.43s -> 4632.47s]  just said that's fucked up after what you said because I wasn't paying any attention. I thought
[4632.47s -> 4635.03s]  you're talking about like the zombies or whatever. I was trying to fill dead air while you were in
[4635.03s -> 4639.19s]  the settings again. I did the thing where you're like on the phone and like you're just talking
[4639.19s -> 4642.78s]  to somebody and you're like that's fucked up and you don't even know what the last sentence they
[4642.78s -> 4650.73s]  said. I was talking about diapers. It's fucked up. You two will have to cross that. It's crazy.
[4652.25s -> 4668.07s]  What the fuck dude. Save him. Whoa. You can continue on. I guess. Did I punch you again?
[4668.55s -> 4684.81s]  Yes. Shoot the thing on the back. Shoot his back. Oh, a bishop. Thanks. Space R. Holy shit.
[4685.77s -> 4691.77s]  Okay. I got it. I'm good. I feel like this is just a bad feeling about this.
[4691.77s -> 4698.76s]  Okay. Those are not zombies. This guy. Get out of here dude. Run. I don't know. Why are you just
[4698.76s -> 4701.88s]  waiting for one of them to do like the thing where they're running and holding their asshole like
[4701.88s -> 4707.45s]  they're going to shit their pants. Okay. I haven't heard that reference in like four years. Just like
[4707.45s -> 4715.14s]  walking really quickly, holding your butt, shitting your pants. These are just two people
[4715.14s -> 4722.76s]  who lock themselves out of the trunk. And why the fuck does that happen in any movie or TV show?
[4722.76s -> 4725.80s]  You know what I'm talking about? Like why is it like a funny reference? Nobody like does like the
[4725.80s -> 4738.18s]  quick walk holding butt. I've never seen anybody do that. You got to be the the visionary. What is
[4738.18s -> 4742.94s]  this game's fucking broken. Just keep going. You weren't allowed to shoot them yet. They
[4742.94s -> 4748.25s]  were doing the cinematic thing. We're going to help this guy. Okay. I'll cover you.
[4748.97s -> 4756.71s]  Oh, both of us have to help this guy. Use your motherly strength. Oh yeah. This is GTA.
[4757.43s -> 4771.50s]  That was a stream sniper. What the fuck? We don't have time to deal with this. We need
[4771.50s -> 4776.30s]  ammo and shit though, dude. Yeah. So that's why they first of all, there's a military zombie
[4776.30s -> 4781.40s]  with like an assault rifle and they are shooting at us. This is too loud. Everyone always asks why
[4781.40s -> 4785.48s]  I might. The zombies have guns now in there. Oh, the zombies have guns. That's what it was. That's
[4785.48s -> 4790.63s]  why everybody hates this game. I remember I'm first. I always have the game really quiet
[4790.63s -> 4794.79s]  because that's easy to pay attention. I feel like my game's loud. I think my game is a little too
[4794.79s -> 4807.46s]  loud. The audio is good. Oh, perfect. I have, I don't know. You should. Okay. I have one bomb.
[4807.46s -> 4812.18s]  You want to put it down there? No, no, no. You just got to jump across. Okay. I couldn't put it down
[4812.18s -> 4822.54s]  there. Well, see if I can kill them. They didn't work. It did hurt me though. Why did you have a
[4822.54s -> 4832.23s]  cut scene? I didn't. You just kind of like leapt across. Okay. All right. That was all right.
[4835.22s -> 4844.86s]  What's wrong with my camera? I'm like permanently left-handed in this game because my
[4845.42s -> 4851.02s]  camera gets reset every time we do a co-op. Yeah. You're hitting caps lock. We got to run.
[4853.80s -> 4872.36s]  Ron, this way. Okay. Ron, Ron, do you know that guy? I've, I've, that's fine. We're good. What the
[4872.36s -> 4879.83s]  fuck is happening? I didn't even want to do that. Get up the ladder. Artists spend a lot of time
[4879.83s -> 4888.18s]  on these custom kills. Who, who got that there? We just like, I don't know. We just fucked up
[4888.18s -> 4896.82s]  somebody's car. Go. What the fuck is happening to me? What's going on? I just got lit up through
[4896.82s -> 4902.58s]  the grate. I can't move. I don't even understand what just happened. Why can't we get? Oh,
[4906.50s -> 4919.72s]  go. Now where? Over here? Okay. They were opening the new like path for us.
[4925.98s -> 4931.30s]  Leon is so cool. He's so cool. It looks like this way is blocked.
[4932.41s -> 4937.05s]  They're always so cool. A family of three just died. I guess we're not going that way.
[4938.89s -> 4947.59s]  And catch our breath. That'd be kind of cool if you could. I'd be really happy about that.
[4948.15s -> 4951.43s]  They should make a, they should make Resident Evil games like mini game games.
[4951.43s -> 4959.67s]  This should be a Resident Evil party game, like Mario party. What about Resident Evil, like
[4959.67s -> 4969.98s]  soccer? That'd be kind of cool. You can shoot them. What do you mean? Shoot what? I don't know. What
[4969.98s -> 4977.53s]  are you referring to? I don't know what he was saying. Well, yeah, I talked to the people over
[4977.53s -> 4985.21s]  here in my brain. The pool balls. Oh, you can shoot the pool balls. Did they do anything?
[4985.77s -> 4993.96s]  They're saying that it does. Oh my God. It works. Okay. So here's the thing. I got it.
[4993.96s -> 5001.54s]  My ball point. Oh, I was going to, we're going to call balls. And yeah, but if you play pool,
[5001.54s -> 5006.98s]  the person, if you, if you, if you get it, like I got solids, um, I've got the first one,
[5006.98s -> 5011.06s]  which is really stupid by the way, it went like it, that means that somebody can just literally
[5011.06s -> 5019.05s]  win and I don't get to play. Now I got to get the eight ball. If you get good at, you can get
[5019.05s -> 5023.13s]  to the point where you're, you physically don't. I should have just bet you something for that one
[5023.13s -> 5028.15s]  because that was pretty good. Wait, were you seeing pool balls different? Stop tripping over
[5028.15s -> 5033.59s]  there. Okay. There we go. Oh, what was that? Hold on. I want to hear that again. You said,
[5033.59s -> 5058.04s]  you said something very specific because alive is a gun client side. Uh, where'd he go? I'll go.
[5058.04s -> 5065.19s]  It's too scary in here. I'll go. Oh, I thought they were alive. Yeah. I was going to say they're
[5065.19s -> 5071.98s]  not even zombies. They are. They're going to stand out. There's one behind us. It's going to,
[5071.98s -> 5075.10s]  it's going to change to the fucking, to our Twitch channels and they're going to get up and
[5075.10s -> 5083.02s]  fucking flip out the man that'd be changed. No, these are people already watching our
[5083.02s -> 5101.05s]  Twitch channels. This is just what they look like. That's no, the entire city is on fire.
[5101.37s -> 5109.80s]  I hate that so much. So wait, do we, do we both get this? What do you mean it's locked? Find the
[5109.80s -> 5117.59s]  key. Kick it open. So where's the key? Oh, you have to, you have to carefully reach to grab the key
[5117.59s -> 5124.38s]  and then you not get grabbed. You, you want to grab key? I'll be ready. Tell me when you get it.
[5125.62s -> 5136.50s]  Going in. I'm going in for the sparkle. I have become afraid. We picked the wrong person to be
[5136.50s -> 5149.03s]  worried about. All right. We're good. Oh, I have, I have the key. There wasn't even an animation for
[5149.03s -> 5159.38s]  me grabbing it. Oh, come on. This stupid game. Of course, like you said, they are not real until
[5159.38s -> 5166.47s]  the game decides they are. Uh huh. Are you, are you healthy? Are you good? I'm not okay.
[5167.67s -> 5172.79s]  I need help. You want to talk about it? I need to talk about you having healing potions to give me.
[5173.83s -> 5179.86s]  I have four. Oh, a shotgun. Nope. Mine. Oh, you got it too. That's not cool anymore. I want my other
[5179.86s -> 5185.46s]  one bag. Do you have two shotguns? I do have two now. Yeah. Oh, that's kind of convenient. I think
[5185.46s -> 5192.66s]  we got the same one. I got like a triple barrel with no stock and then the, the tactical one.
[5192.66s -> 5195.70s]  Sorry. I have, I can't hear a thing you're saying. I'm a little screaming.
[5197.74s -> 5210.47s]  Okay. I want to use this combined with my backpack. Eat only one heel. That sucks.
[5214.65s -> 5219.21s]  Oh, this door's locked. Find the house key. Oh, this metal door is locked.
[5219.21s -> 5229.61s]  Kick their bosses. This is a boss. It's resident evil. You have to mix it with another herb. All
[5229.61s -> 5236.39s]  right. I see. Uh huh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. He's just afraid of us. I got him. Watch out.
[5236.39s -> 5245.61s]  That guy's a bomb. They're coming in behind behind us. Why can't we just shut the door?
[5248.60s -> 5255.42s]  He's fucking head. Wait, I'm just going to play through the rest of the game like this.
[5256.06s -> 5261.50s]  What do you, why can I not trip over you? That's the weird thing.
[5265.53s -> 5269.21s]  Are they different? Okay. Is it just red and green herbs or is there more?
[5269.21s -> 5272.81s]  Uh, I've only seen the two so far. They're like the turkeys over here, wherever it is.
[5275.00s -> 5281.13s]  I'm not going to explore. Yeah. I'm not going near that. He didn't, he didn't explore. That
[5281.13s -> 5285.93s]  was anticlimactic. Yes. Red and green. It became a trophy. We have skills.
[5289.46s -> 5299.13s]  Hey, green. All right. I got to, we need to do a skill thing here. It hasn't been a quiet moment
[5299.13s -> 5303.93s]  to really do anything. It's just been like constant conflict. Are you playing house of the dead?
[5304.73s -> 5310.07s]  It kind of does have that vibe. Doesn't it? Yeah. It even has the game over when one partner dies
[5310.63s -> 5315.16s]  repeatedly. Oh, we got, that is absolutely a red barrel. I'm ready for it.
[5316.97s -> 5319.53s]  You, what do you, why would, I don't understand why you do that. That's you.
[5319.53s -> 5322.25s]  You were this close to saying you fuck. You were this close.
[5322.25s -> 5325.93s]  That was, that was, there's nothing funny about that. You just ruined our experience.
[5327.67s -> 5330.47s]  You didn't, no, no, no, you just ruined my experience because I wanted to shoot that
[5330.47s -> 5338.58s]  and kill some people. You just ruined my experience. No one's even there.
[5338.58s -> 5343.19s]  We're not even going to be over there. It's not how that is strong.
[5345.75s -> 5348.95s]  All right. So you just jumped down. What would have been right there?
[5349.67s -> 5353.51s]  That would have been great. Are you supposed to be doing something?
[5353.51s -> 5359.51s]  Yeah, I'm doing it. I'm doing it. You just got to stay alive. Pushing this giant heap of trash
[5359.51s -> 5366.63s]  as fast as I can. And I don't mean the video game. I love, I have no, I'm the guy with no ammo and no
[5366.63s -> 5378.34s]  health and I'm the one that has to take care of this. Can I go now? No, I'm still looking
[5378.34s -> 5381.06s]  for an exit. You're still looking for the exit. I'm actually just going to leave you behind.
[5381.06s -> 5390.81s]  That guy got cracked. What? I'm waiting for you currently to do a co-op moment.
[5390.81s -> 5394.49s]  What? I can't even get down the stairs. How are you waiting for a co-op?
[5394.49s -> 5397.21s]  How am I supposed to free you? Wait, hold on. Oh, right here.
[5397.85s -> 5405.08s]  Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
[5405.88s -> 5409.42s]  I'm helping.
[5411.98s -> 5420.23s]  Now you really got to help me. Okay. I'm coming. Oh, I can heal you with the number one instead of
[5420.23s -> 5430.44s]  pushing V. I've apparently been choosing not to heal you. What is? Okay. I'm going to run.
[5431.16s -> 5445.11s]  Do I have any heels? No, I'm not going to combine this. Oh God. Why is V back? Oh,
[5449.14s -> 5454.26s]  too green. No, I want to do green and red. Just do it. I want to a green and red though.
[5454.26s -> 5460.55s]  I want to do red starburst. I do. Those are the best ones. It's only three. What the fuck?
[5460.55s -> 5466.01s]  You look like you're passing out right now. I probably am. Your hands are on your knees.
[5467.40s -> 5478.15s]  You're holding your gut. Don't call me menu Andy. These guys really take a lot. They pop a lot of
[5478.15s -> 5490.76s]  pills. Come on. You have to help them. Are these survivors? Is this humanity? What the fuck?
[5492.44s -> 5496.60s]  That was the only non. That was the only NPC in the whole goddamn group.
[5502.02s -> 5511.77s]  Boo. He's standing in front of me on purpose. Watch out. The guy on the top of the guy on top
[5511.77s -> 5518.62s]  of the truck. We have to shoot. We have to shoot his like growth. Oh yeah. That guy that you
[5518.62s -> 5523.26s]  already killed him in like four bullets and then he screams and then what happens? I think we get
[5523.26s -> 5536.09s]  more. What the hell? I guess that ambulance came out of nowhere and ran directly into me.
[5536.09s -> 5544.44s]  That was that car was going 80 miles per hour. That was not even like 30. The car was going
[5544.44s -> 5551.14s]  100 miles. Can an ambulance even go like 150 miles per hour? All right. This time we're going to get
[5551.14s -> 5562.78s]  this right. Come on. We have to help them. Deus ex drivers. It's actually easier to be on the
[5562.78s -> 5567.91s]  ground. All right. So wait, are you not on the ground? It's easier to lie on the ground and shoot.
[5569.03s -> 5588.55s]  Okay. But watch out for the. Oh, please. Really? Oh, he screams at us. Here it comes again. Oh,
[5588.55s -> 5595.78s]  it got you. All right. Clipped you on the back tire. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[5595.78s -> 5599.51s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Cleric beast noise. Yeah,
[5599.51s -> 5611.62s]  it is going like I thought I was going to be out of the way. Oh, survivors. Come on. We have to
[5611.62s -> 5617.72s]  help. How do you do? How do you do this? Bad ass slide. Just stand over here. There's no reason
[5617.72s -> 5622.33s]  to be in that direction. Yeah, we don't need to save these people. They're fine. But we can.
[5625.37s -> 5633.56s]  We're going to get ambulance in like 10 seconds. Oh no, there really are. Take that guy out right
[5633.56s -> 5648.41s]  now. He's on top of right here. Oh my God. You idiots. I want to get all that stuff before
[5648.41s -> 5662.06s]  the cut scene gets us. I want to get, let's go quick. Oh, go, go, go, go fast. Oh, what's wrong
[5662.06s -> 5677.70s]  with my body? I wasn't even close. I actually wasn't even close. I was over near you. What the
[5677.78s -> 5692.09s]  fuck? I'm serious. That I was actually not even close. I was over. This is the Leon campaign.
[5693.82s -> 5706.78s]  So bad. I, you know, I'm turning on the fucking tryhard right now. I always think that's the
[5706.78s -> 5719.37s]  ambulance. I know. All right. Fuck that guy. I don't. Did you see that? Watch out ambulance.
[5720.76s -> 5726.52s]  It's already ambulance. Just go over to the left. Okay. All right. My goodness. There's more.
[5726.52s -> 5748.28s]  There's more inside and they have body armor. He's got guns too. Okay. We're good. When do we,
[5748.28s -> 5755.91s]  when do we actually pick skills? Shoot the gas. Wait, don't shoot it yet with this stuff.
[5756.71s -> 5767.80s]  It's like a, there's like an omega thing over here. Okay. I'm, I'm ready. What are the second
[5767.80s -> 5771.40s]  ambulance? I don't know, but all the NPCs are over here. So it's definitely this far away.
[5778.92s -> 5786.22s]  We're good. I think we're okay. Yep. It's safe. We're here. We can rearm there.
[5786.22s -> 5790.39s]  Probably finding more people there too. I'm walking like I'm injured, but I have full health.
[5791.03s -> 5797.53s]  I think it's stamina. I don't see any other options. Oh yeah. Well, I think I'm just being
[5797.53s -> 5806.57s]  dramatic. It's Alex. We've been playing this game for an hour and a half. Yeah. It's the same level.
[5806.57s -> 5816.36s]  I feel, I, I, my brain is stuck. But also I don't think turning the difficulty down would have
[5816.36s -> 5831.05s]  stopped the one hit train kills. No. I'll just take all of his cool stuff. Who does he think
[5831.05s -> 5840.81s]  we are? Exterminators? God. It's nonstop. So just want to make it really clear. We could have just
[5840.81s -> 5846.30s]  seen an entire Will Ferrell movie. It already played. Like one of the new ones or one of the
[5846.30s -> 5852.84s]  older ones? Probably one of the new ones. That's the ones I would have muted. All right. We just
[5852.84s -> 5858.14s]  have to eliminate enemies. Yeah. That's a, did you just read that off the screen? I would just
[5858.14s -> 5870.33s]  make sure we didn't have to go upstairs. You never know. There's no way to tell. Don't worry.
[5870.33s -> 5873.77s]  Somebody doesn't already have this window. Hey, there's probably at least three people
[5874.41s -> 5880.25s]  in one of the chats making some zombies. Cod zombies jokes here. I just want to say,
[5880.25s -> 5884.25s]  I know who you are at the Cola. This Cola somewhere did not laugh. Minus two.
[5884.65s -> 5899.53s]  Okay. I have the incendiary grenade. Oh, I thought he was breaking her neck.
[5900.33s -> 5910.54s]  I thought he was going to get like a snap. Um, what the fuck? I didn't. I thought I threw that
[5912.46s -> 5917.50s]  I had to throw the incendiary onto. I had full health. Not anymore. But I was saving you. See,
[5917.50s -> 5937.35s]  the zombie that was on you died. Very funny. Very funny. These are, these are enemies from
[5937.35s -> 5947.29s]  dead rising. That guy had a golf club, clubs, axes, hammers. Somebody said this game feels
[5947.29s -> 5960.87s]  like mockery. Are they like an art critic? What? He's trying to kill them. I think that's the gun
[5960.87s -> 5976.23s]  shuffle. Oh, all right. We still have to kill enemies. Is the car shooting at us? I'm so
[5976.31s -> 5985.51s]  panicked. All right. That, that, that zombie's neck just became stretch Armstrong for a half
[5985.51s -> 6000.84s]  second and by an ambulance. Yep. Why would you wait? Was he going to monologue? Oh, it turned
[6000.84s -> 6010.28s]  into a different animal. Oh, Peter. Peter was my favorite side character, but we can go outside.
[6010.28s -> 6018.28s]  Peter was my favorite guy dressed in summer Sims clothing. He's in, he's in venom is in.
[6019.24s -> 6049.26s]  Is he dead? Nice. I still have no health. Whoa. We should be pretty close. Are we alive? Can we,
[6049.26s -> 6053.66s]  are you sure we're not supposed to just leave? Does eliminate all enemies? Yeah. Yeah. It does
[6053.66s -> 6059.94s]  say that we can go outside. I wouldn't if I were you. That doesn't sound very safe.
[6060.74s -> 6078.14s]  You're a, please tell italics to watch his six. Elbow drop that zombie. Please tell what I watch
[6078.14s -> 6084.66s]  your six. Okay. Yeah, I got it. I got it. When do we get to stop doing this? Hang on. Is it,
[6084.66s -> 6091.46s]  is that the like six when you're high or like the six when you're not high? What was the analog
[6091.46s -> 6102.38s]  clock joke? Oh, I probably couldn't even do that right now. Wait, you had a lockdown button.
[6103.10s -> 6115.38s]  I think I picked everything up off. You're all right. He said to come up. We have to go
[6115.38s -> 6125.62s]  upstairs now. Hey, I accidentally alt tab. There's bullets everywhere. Do you need help?
[6126.18s -> 6136.58s]  You let me know if you need help. Do you need help? What are you shooting at? Oh, hold on. I
[6136.58s -> 6145.53s]  need to heal. I'm going to combine some shit. How do you get out of here? I like, okay. So there
[6145.53s -> 6152.15s]  was a lot of action going on. I accidentally alt tab. How do I use this? I tab back in and everyone's
[6152.15s -> 6167.80s]  gone. Yeah. We went upstairs, bro. Oh, it's this. Yeah. Oh, now the door's locked. We're safe. I got
[6167.80s -> 6173.00s]  some folks coming for me in a bus. Any minute now, make it on board. It's a straight shot to
[6173.00s -> 6178.76s]  tall Oaks cathedral. People are evacuating there. Heard it on the radio, but that's a big if it's
[6178.76s -> 6185.46s]  a shit storm out there. We ain't waiting for any stragglers. Okay. Is this, is this dude like old
[6185.46s -> 6191.22s]  man explaining to us how bad the situation is outside? He just started shooting at that guy. Oh,
[6192.18s -> 6202.02s]  what the fuck? Why would you get the shutters? No. What door do I look out from this with this
[6202.02s -> 6213.27s]  window right here? How? Why even shoot the gun? They get, they're all going to do it outside with
[6213.27s -> 6218.95s]  a flashlight just ran across stage 11. Somebody has out there with a light. I don't see any. Oh,
[6218.95s -> 6229.70s]  somebody is out there. Who is it? This is just the game. Okay. The game was not made for more
[6229.70s -> 6232.90s]  than four players, but we modded it and like ruined the whole experience.
[6234.42s -> 6238.26s]  That's one of the big red guys. It's so loud. It is. Yeah, I guess.
[6239.38s -> 6243.62s]  That actually would be kind of funny. Imagine having 10 people in this room.
[6244.74s -> 6250.70s]  This guy is kicking the shit out of me. Please somebody help me. The carnage is attacking me.
[6250.70s -> 6259.64s]  This lady is just her AI has stopped working. What are we huddling? I don't know who I'm attacking.
[6260.60s -> 6276.31s]  I guess I'm what the hell is going on? This is so stupid. I drop it in from the ceiling.
[6277.35s -> 6286.66s]  Are you alive? I'm dying over on the corner here. Have a have a mental. Oh, thanks. You'll feel
[6286.66s -> 6298.49s]  better. I guess I feel all right. I don't know that this guy's supposed to be closing the shutters.
[6303.77s -> 6320.58s]  Why? Why is there a drop kick? This is very strangely aiming. Oh shit. All right.
[6329.85s -> 6335.69s]  Finally. Oh, why did that take so long? I don't know. This game is not good. It's not good at all.
[6336.65s -> 6342.46s]  Were we supposed to do that? No, I think it's just time based, but it's like this is weird.
[6345.69s -> 6354.82s]  We all don't tell me to do that again. We did it again. No, we don't. What the fuck? I'm just
[6354.82s -> 6374.57s]  trying to be my inventory. Okay. Okay. Don't just run out of. All right. All right. I'm in the corner.
[6374.57s -> 6380.97s]  I'm not good. I'm going to help you up while the giant monster is breathing over. Where is
[6380.97s -> 6387.05s]  he? He's just stepped on my head, dude. Why does the entire screen just flash white? There are too
[6387.05s -> 6393.16s]  many people in this room for what we're doing. This is so stupid. I can't even get up. All right.
[6393.16s -> 6405.29s]  I'm just going to drop some remote bombs. Why is he running at me? In the stomach? Lead it back
[6405.29s -> 6419.72s]  over here. It's the guy from Saints Row. Yeah. Good work. Good work, officer. You guys aren't even
[6419.72s -> 6434.70s]  helping. Frank disconnected. We need to add skills. I'm stopping right here. Where's skill
[6434.70s -> 6446.92s]  points? Equip skills. Finally. I just heard something. I got you six. Where do you equip skills?
[6447.74s -> 6452.14s]  I think it's between missions. This has been the same mission the entire time. Okay. Hold on.
[6453.19s -> 6465.26s]  Let me combine some stuff. I got this. So I want to put this in my inventory. Okay. Shut up. Wow.
[6466.22s -> 6477.35s]  All right. Hang on. I'm combining some stuff too. There is one mouse wheel scroll between store
[6477.35s -> 6487.29s]  in case and delete from game. Yeah. I don't think you've had fun for a single time. I think I've
[6487.29s -> 6492.14s]  been having fun. I think we're having a good time. Yeah. This is the kind of shitty that you have fun
[6492.14s -> 6500.62s]  with. Yeah. So we made it outside. They're waiting for us. Not like Resident Evil 3,
[6500.62s -> 6509.34s]  which was just shitty. Yeah. Resident Evil 3 was pretty bad. It just didn't do it for anybody. I
[6509.34s -> 6516.49s]  don't think this is like watching the Far Cry movie on Netflix. We're going to help this guy.
[6517.53s -> 6526.17s]  Now let him fall. Help him up. I'll cover you. Oh, watch out. Another big guy. Wait, wait, wait,
[6526.17s -> 6531.61s]  wait, wait. I didn't even want to do that. Why did it do that? I didn't. I swear to God. I didn't
[6531.61s -> 6541.03s]  want to do that. Do we both? Do we both have the same plan? Yes, we did. I think it worked.
[6541.03s -> 6550.36s]  Are you dead? Wait, where are you? I'm dead. Yeah, I did. Have a tic tac. Yeah. I keep eating
[6550.36s -> 6559.21s]  your tic tacs. Honest to fucking God. Why are you going for you? There's 10 people. Is this a bit?
[6559.21s -> 6563.85s]  No, he does 10 people here. Why do you have to attack me? I was all the way in the back.
[6564.57s -> 6568.25s]  Are you sure you're not doing like a see how long it takes to notice that he's the only one
[6568.25s -> 6587.35s]  shooting zombies? No. Oh my God. I'm going to die. It's bad. I'm going to die. I'm lying on the
[6587.35s -> 6594.89s]  ground. Just one more of those. I'm the dick that keeps asking you for tic tacs and you only
[6594.89s -> 6600.76s]  have like a few left and you don't want to give me all of them. Hey, can I borrow a pencil? Hey,
[6600.76s -> 6613.06s]  you have any gum? Can we go? I know you have two pieces of gum left and I've asked for two.
[6613.94s -> 6621.42s]  All right, let's get out of here. Do we have to go? I'm going to stay here and shoot zombies
[6621.42s -> 6635.32s]  forever because I have so much fun up on this roof. Get to the bus. They've been waiting for
[6635.32s -> 6647.19s]  us down here. It's about to have a new character. Well, you can tell this game takes place in New
[6647.19s -> 6653.13s]  York because none of these people have their own personal car. We're going to take public
[6653.13s -> 6658.22s]  transportation. I'm just going to I'm just going to pretend like I didn't hear it. Oh,
[6658.22s -> 6673.38s]  wait, they're sucking that guy out. Why can't I shoot this gun? I'm get you dead. No, I'm not.
[6673.38s -> 6689.18s]  I'm fine. Okay, but what did I just what? Oh, no. Oh, no. Back up. He was so close to me.
[6691.03s -> 6707.59s]  I did. Oh, give me a break. So excessive. We're going to crash immediately too. What's with the
[6707.59s -> 6714.76s]  end horror movies? People just driving a straight line into walls. That was that was one mission.
[6714.84s -> 6721.00s]  What was your accuracy? 64 percent. Oh, I was 79. Well, hold on. That's bullshit because you
[6721.00s -> 6726.36s]  had a shotgun. Rank A. You had a shotgun from the very beginning, which means you don't even
[6726.36s -> 6730.92s]  have to fucking aim. I had a pistol from the beginning. First hour was skewed. You had three
[6730.92s -> 6735.16s]  times as many pistols as I did. It doesn't matter. You have your shotgun will hit something. I have
[6735.16s -> 6740.87s]  to actually pinpoint the laser on people's heads. That's unfair. In fact, I think that mine's
[6740.87s -> 6745.51s]  probably better than yours. Okay, but that doesn't explain the extra nine enemies routed.
[6745.51s -> 6750.87s]  End game. By the way, can we just stop for a second and acknowledge that we apparently killed,
[6750.87s -> 6758.71s]  I assume, four hundred and fifty seven. What? Enemies in one mission. Is that am I doing the
[6758.71s -> 6763.51s]  math right there? Yeah, that's a lot. That seems like a lot. I don't think we did that.
[6765.62s -> 6773.58s]  I don't think we killed more than 30 or 40 people. 30 or 40. Maybe like 50. All right.
[6774.78s -> 6786.70s]  Hold on. Do we? This is literally a timer at the top. Can you hit? Okay. Oh, it's a timer for me.
[6786.70s -> 6791.08s]  Oh, we have to make sure we do this right because I don't want you to have the same
[6791.08s -> 6795.80s]  thing that I have so we can be different character classes. Okay. How many skill points do you have?
[6795.80s -> 6800.36s]  I have twelve thousand seven hundred experience. You got I got eleven three.
[6800.36s -> 6805.40s]  So even though I did more of the work, I got less skill points. That just means I did better work.
[6806.04s -> 6823.08s]  Okay. Melee level one defense lock on level two ritz Java killer. Slight melee damage is like all
[6823.08s -> 6833.08s]  points. Two of them are twelve thousand. So I'm like just shy of the big. I think I want crits.
[6833.08s -> 6842.81s]  You can scroll down. Oh shit. You can scroll. Oh, quick reload. Oh, greatly increases the strength
[6842.81s -> 6847.85s]  of your final remaining shot. I'm not going to pay attention to that one. The five removes your
[6847.85s -> 6854.97s]  targeting site, but increases your firepower. Oh, that's cool. Break free easily from enemy's
[6854.97s -> 6860.17s]  grasp. Yeah, that seems like that seems easy to pick. Oh, wait a minute. Hold on, dude. You
[6860.17s -> 6869.62s]  only get to have three of these active at once. Oh, yeah. There's a single player only one hundred
[6869.62s -> 6883.66s]  points. Okay, hold on. Wait, can I do a double? No. What does team up? No. Fuck that. There's a
[6883.66s -> 6890.97s]  lot of question marks at the bottom. Oh, that's single player only. Yeah, that's stupid.
[6890.97s -> 6897.34s]  Keeps your partner from helping you. Oh, God. Getting in the way. We have to pick weapons to.
[6897.34s -> 6903.54s]  Did you already pick your skills? I picked breakout, which I feel like was pretty useful.
[6907.35s -> 6910.95s]  Arrow pickup allows you to pick up an increased number of normal and pipe bombs.
[6913.78s -> 6921.05s]  Lone wolf field medic team up item drop increase. Yeah, you got to pick the item drop, right?
[6921.05s -> 6925.03s]  I feel like that's really important. Yeah. All right, we're going to be exact same build. Oh,
[6925.03s -> 6928.87s]  we're going to have the exact same build, but those are gimmies. But here's the thing, though.
[6928.87s -> 6936.31s]  It's that's really that's very useful. A lot get a zombie hunter level one. Yeah, but fuck that
[6936.31s -> 6946.79s]  lock on level one. What is it? What you want? Aim assist. Please shoot somebody. Please start
[6946.79s -> 6954.55s]  shooting people on board. I'm we're going to do this. We just killed like 500, 500 enemies killed
[6954.55s -> 6961.35s]  defense. I think I'll I'll try the lock steady's hand when shooting. Who cares?
[6961.35s -> 6968.78s]  All right, I'm going for it. I'm going to be Mr. Melee. Okay, I'm going to be crit. And
[6969.74s -> 6975.75s]  now this is locked because I used. Oh, god damn it. Whatever. Okay, I'm going to save my points.
[6975.75s -> 6990.34s]  I have enough points. All right, that's fine. Okay, let's go. Hey, I'm going to get item drop.
[6990.90s -> 6996.44s]  All right, ready? I think I'm ready. I got item drop breakout and lock on. I want the melee one,
[6996.44s -> 7000.60s]  though. How do you go to the next screen? Do you have to hit escape? I think we just have to hit
[7000.60s -> 7029.00s]  escape or something out of here. We're going to have to kill 70,000 people that an organization
[7029.64s -> 7039.22s]  This is a weird phone. That's like what people thought technology was going to look like
[7040.34s -> 7047.38s]  in 2012. You know, like we had just invented iPhones like five years prior. That's actually
[7047.38s -> 7055.02s]  kind of true. And then they did Google Glass anyways. You know, we all knew it was going to
[7055.02s -> 7065.34s]  fail, but they did it anyways. This is what graphics will be like in 2016. You know what
[7065.34s -> 7073.38s]  the difference in graphics is between this game and a modern game? There was no reason to go that
[7073.38s -> 7078.90s]  fast. It's just a person like I why what you just really wanted to show off that you're going to
[7078.90s -> 7082.50s]  ram this guy going like 80. We could have you could have just ran them over slowly and killed
[7082.50s -> 7092.15s]  them. There was no point to go that one guy and nearly drove us to our death. Yeah, there was no
[7092.15s -> 7096.31s]  reason to do that. All right, I actually need the alt tab to turn the volume down. So you got to
[7096.39s -> 7108.70s]  protect me. Okay, I'm gonna watch the cutscene first though. Hey, watch this. Watch this.
[7111.18s -> 7118.46s]  All right, protect me. Um, I don't have any bullets in my gun. Why is that guy floating?
[7123.93s -> 7133.00s]  This is making me sick. All right, I'm coming back in. I'm here. What the hell? Stop ignoring.
[7135.54s -> 7143.11s]  Are we dead? I think we're okay. Good job. Oh, here's another guy that said watch this before
[7143.11s -> 7150.38s]  he got behind the wheel. Why are they doing this? Why? Hey, check this out. See that school bus
[7150.38s -> 7157.77s]  over there? Watch this. Hold my beard joke. They just all go so fast. You don't have to go this
[7157.77s -> 7165.70s]  fast. What what if they're all like other players and we're their objective marker. So they're just
[7165.70s -> 7170.98s]  like driving and they think they're going to their objective but they're all beelining to ram into
[7170.98s -> 7176.36s]  us. Why are people saying I'm ignoring everybody? What do I do? What happened?
[7178.55s -> 7189.02s]  Read. It's important. I'm literally, I'm staring at the chat right now. I'm reading.
[7192.41s -> 7195.05s]  We're the main characters so that's how we survived and everyone else died?
[7197.46s -> 7203.00s]  Literally every other character is dead at this point I think. Read this. Read this.
[7203.64s -> 7217.93s]  Are you still the Among Us guy? Not anymore? No, not anymore. I'm the serial killer guy now.
[7220.47s -> 7226.25s]  Did you see that? Did I see what? Were you doing something like serial killer-esque?
[7226.25s -> 7233.29s]  No. So on the front page of all Reddit with 50,000 fucking upvotes. I'm not even kidding. 50,000
[7233.29s -> 7239.45s]  upvotes. Wow. They um. 50,000 upvotes. 50,000. That's like these three Reddit golds for the
[7239.45s -> 7244.01s]  first like top comment. Yeah um actually you know what if you don't even want to like breathe life
[7244.01s -> 7248.41s]  back into this just know that they put an image of me on the front page of Reddit somehow and it was
[7248.41s -> 7253.29s]  like every serial killer combined into AI and like people believed it and it spread everywhere. Did
[7253.29s -> 7258.57s]  you uh thank the kind strangers? No I actually screamed at them and said stop fucking ruining my
[7258.57s -> 7263.21s]  life. I'm just going to bury myself. Watch out this is a fucking Dark Souls enemy.
[7264.76s -> 7271.08s]  I am in a grave. I just drop kicked a zombie in a flooding grave.
[7271.96s -> 7277.24s]  I'm just going to I'm just going to play down here. These guys are actually pretty weak.
[7279.93s -> 7292.15s]  Are you are you stuck or are you can you get up? You actually need help or is this a routine?
[7293.96s -> 7300.92s]  Yeah. Don't take care of your business. That was that was from my stream. Oh. That was for you.
[7302.81s -> 7306.33s]  Oh that's right. You you've got to do some comedy routines for your stream.
[7306.33s -> 7311.88s]  That's because if you go down there you'll see what happens. Oh that is kind of funny.
[7312.84s -> 7333.86s]  It's not funny. I just got bit. Get me the fuck out of here. How do you actually oh um
[7334.74s -> 7340.02s]  lightning just struck. Okay we're fine. I sensed a disturbance in the force. Oh dad.
[7344.79s -> 7348.15s]  Because it doesn't it doesn't do anything crazy when I get hit.
[7348.23s -> 7354.46s]  Only when you do. I guess it's supposed to be like a hey your partner's in trouble.
[7354.46s -> 7358.46s]  Oh that's probably what it is. Did you get the emblem over the entire screen? I can't believe
[7358.46s -> 7361.90s]  you haven't seen it. Did you get the emblem over here? Maybe it's because I never get attacked or
[7361.90s -> 7368.81s]  die. Did you get the emblem over here? I did yeah. Idiot. The big the giant blue one. I got it yeah.
[7370.55s -> 7379.03s]  I got it like 10 seconds ago. No no that that was it. What how is that it? I think this is
[7379.03s -> 7384.95s]  lightning. Oh it's trying to scare us. I get it. When the lightning strikes we have new monsters
[7384.95s -> 7392.52s]  on the screen. Are the other monsters riding the lightning? I think they're just here when
[7392.52s -> 7399.53s]  it's to scare you I think. Is the final boss Zeus? I don't know. Can we get mythological
[7399.53s -> 7403.29s]  in Resident Evil? I don't I have no idea where this sits in the timeline. I have no idea.
[7410.52s -> 7414.68s]  Okay be more efficient with this because these guys actually take like three hits from a knife.
[7415.40s -> 7426.31s]  Oh thank you Vectro for the 20 immunity subs. Appreciate it now. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah one
[7426.31s -> 7432.02s]  two three yeah it's three hits with the knife. I was using shotgun bullets on these idiots.
[7432.02s -> 7442.15s]  Getting ready to speed run this game? I've been watching speed runs. I've become I've become a
[7442.15s -> 7452.90s]  huge fan of Mario 64 speed run. Do you need help? There you go. I literally watched Box Box get his
[7452.90s -> 7468.18s]  PB last night it was fucking awesome. Did he cut the sandwich into triangles? No I was gonna I was
[7468.18s -> 7473.06s]  gonna like gift a bunch of subs but like my credit card got declined so and he was like ended the
[7473.06s -> 7485.77s]  stream right after so I would look like an idiot. I missed every shot god damn it. I don't think
[7485.77s -> 7495.00s]  you were supposed to kill it anyways. Oh yeah we were. He's got the key in his mouth. I've seen
[7495.00s -> 7510.15s]  this movie. It could be chasing us. Where's the uh where's the drunk pirate? Where'd you go? I'm
[7510.15s -> 7516.17s]  right here. Are you doing like a your invisible joke? No no no I just I thought I saw the indicator
[7516.17s -> 7524.36s]  I didn't know if you were down here. Sprinting is like five percent faster than just moving.
[7529.05s -> 7536.28s]  Don't even attack. What's the point? Just go we gotta get the dog. What all right but that's like
[7536.28s -> 7543.88s]  actual zombie okay zombie apocalypse day 14 you just go outside your house you see a bunch
[7543.88s -> 7548.52s]  of zombies and just what's the point there's two million more like what's the point just
[7549.32s -> 7558.07s]  all right there it is there is go it's probably gonna run all right get that key
[7560.54s -> 7567.48s]  key hello what are you looking at get out of here me no this guy was just looking off my shoulder
[7568.36s -> 7578.09s]  is italics a friend or a foe foe absolutely 100 percent what which one oh 100 percent
[7579.40s -> 7587.98s]  fro oh 100 that and this is the reason why i don't have to explain anymore what the
[7587.98s -> 7607.62s]  fuck if i was a foe would i do this uh yeah i think so uh i said we run you got it i'm running
[7607.62s -> 7621.80s]  what happened i was doing some overkill you okay yeah i'm coming i'm running all the way back up
[7621.80s -> 7628.70s]  the winding path that guy it was so weird all right we're at the door of the cemetery
[7628.70s -> 7637.53s]  is this the haunted house portion of the game okay we're in probably pressing v nothing's happening
[7637.53s -> 7657.75s]  e press v what okay bye god damn it no one can revive you down there and the stupid what the
[7658.23s -> 7665.11s]  you can't attack anybody until they have this spawn protection is removed i what what is this

[7828.81s -> 7833.29s]  on the gates holding v and telling me about spectator but that's before that i beat you
[7833.29s -> 7837.77s]  in the race to get to that point because i just made my way through i was in a problem area as well
[7838.65s -> 7842.65s]  as you were i was hanging back so i can get more kills at the end of the mission
[7842.65s -> 7848.49s]  i have more kills than you and what if it helps you fucking sleep in my bro
[7848.49s -> 7860.42s]  hello it's in there look it's just us did you show something that sounds like i just swallowed
[7860.42s -> 7876.23s]  like a fucking bug okay there's a lot i think we just have to kill this really is the closest game

[7963.64s -> 7969.54s]  is it's just making us do waves of enemies this is not even resident evil this is just a wave
[7969.54s -> 7979.35s]  shooter this is the extra game mode to a resident evil game that's out they did do that like in
[7979.35s -> 7985.02s]  resident evil 5 that was the the multiplayer like what did they call it this is just a regular
[7985.02s -> 7997.46s]  campaign yeah this is a regular campaign okay well let's go for it again the special multiplayer

[8168.84s -> 8175.13s]  ratio hold on i we have to have a better strategy here because this is just this is not going to

[8191.59s -> 8196.23s]  this is not this is not there's no jokes in this scene we just have to win i hate that f is to do

[8276.26s -> 8281.21s]  to look like daniel crick i think gordon ramsey is like one of the probably one of the coolest
[8281.21s -> 8287.82s]  people on television yeah i missed every shot i love the way gordon ramsey like talks with his
[8287.82s -> 8296.92s]  body have you noticed that when he says words you'll notice it he kind of bounces and his like arms
[8296.92s -> 8301.56s]  come up his arms come down and he goes like on his tippy toes down his shoulders while his like
[8301.56s -> 8311.38s]  facial expressions i love it to disdain i love his cadences they're so cool i'm not i'm not
[8311.46s -> 8314.42s]  kidding around all right be careful
[8327.64s -> 8333.00s]  all right guy with the bullfrog all right you have the bomb there let me know if you're gonna blow
[8333.00s -> 8342.65s]  it up oh shit you can knock the guys off the edges it's actually perfect you can shoot them
[8342.65s -> 8354.02s]  down yeah they're on fire it's good like they they drop their torch i mean like starts a fire
[8354.66s -> 8361.96s]  can i climb over there all right let them let them actually get over so we can get the items
[8362.60s -> 8374.22s]  because we want to make sure you get the items all right now wait you're still shooting okay
[8374.22s -> 8381.61s]  i'm ready i got i got i got a bomb right here oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i
[8381.61s -> 8399.70s]  would like to get more than one guy but i'll take not that kill do it fuck all right let us in he
[8399.70s -> 8411.18s]  said all right all right in in in in in in in in what oh what happened i can't see anything
[8411.18s -> 8415.34s]  i can't see anything he screamed are you all right
[8422.15s -> 8424.71s]  i'm gonna pass out i'm gonna pass out i think i actually might pass out
[8425.43s -> 8429.75s]  i might actually pass out i'm not kidding come to the door come to the door come to the door
[8429.75s -> 8454.62s]  come to the door i'm gonna pass out no you're gonna live right oh no man oh no oh no okay so
[8454.62s -> 8460.31s]  once you get raised off the ground you can't sprint i don't know so i have to jog
[8461.27s -> 8466.63s]  this is the whole game by the way i didn't find a level i did not ditch him i heard the call for
[8466.63s -> 8474.22s]  help i saw that he was surrounded by people i got over there i granaded and i almost passed out but
[8474.22s -> 8480.14s]  i'm okay yeah that was that was the last thing i heard is i'm gonna pass out it sounded like
[8480.94s -> 8484.62s]  it sounded like you tried to like make your trauma like more than my almost
[8487.37s -> 8492.09s]  okay buddy why did you almost pass out because i thought it was funny and like i didn't breathe
[8492.89s -> 8498.57s]  look it's just us i got really tense and then laughed and then like my brain was like it's time
[8498.57s -> 8506.55s]  for you to shut off we're just trying to get more gameplay out of this this is like a hundred
[8506.55s -> 8511.59s]  percent run today by the way we have to stay just stay back and just shoot from afar there's no
[8511.59s -> 8514.55s]  reason to even go for the whole thing was like keep them on the just forget about the loot just
[8514.55s -> 8526.47s]  shoot them and just shoot them and let them die you're walking in circles jump behind you
[8531.62s -> 8535.14s]  here comes company i okay here's the thing oh wait do i have any like herbs
[8536.50s -> 8545.91s]  i do i can combine this is game changer okay now we actually who gives a shit just kill them on the
[8545.91s -> 8554.42s]  other side i didn't have any tic-tacs before he better not okay you know you know no no no
[8554.42s -> 8564.02s]  fuck it fuck this where did that even go what where did that go you just shot me in the head
[8564.66s -> 8572.12s]  i did i was saving you from this guy watch out watch out watch out watch out i'm throwing a bomb
[8572.76s -> 8583.02s]  oh that was a good bomb with two bombs yes i had to do it all right now it's almost ready
[8589.14s -> 8601.48s]  teamwork make sure you collect all the items goodness heads gone all right this is where
[8601.48s -> 8618.26s]  we get just absolutely messed hold on all right all right just go and press now thank goodness
[8618.26s -> 8628.17s]  that was so bad to be fair the level we were just on is representative of the entire game so i mean
[8628.17s -> 8637.22s]  we could just pretend like those were different levels we could this game gets dramatically easier
[8637.22s -> 8649.29s]  if you're bad sorry guy rescue worker so which one of these guys is gonna say watch this and
[8649.29s -> 8655.34s]  drive the school bus with all of us in it and kill everybody here wait i think if you die
[8655.34s -> 8662.06s]  they reduce enemies on the next life or is that like just a meme down there i that sounds like a
[8662.06s -> 8672.73s]  meme to me i show you there were definitely no scream guys that time all right search the cathedral
[8673.29s -> 8677.61s]  okay question if you were in a zombie apocalypse and you were in this cathedral and there were two
[8677.61s -> 8682.97s]  people outside begging for help do you open the door uh well there's that that's very very much
[8682.97s -> 8690.33s]  very contextual based because it does this fake scenario if you're a bit do you get infected
[8691.70s -> 8696.02s]  uh i was open the last time i was here i don't know because the heroes get bit all the time
[8696.02s -> 8699.78s]  in this but when people get bit they turn right like if you're not a main character let's take
[8699.78s -> 8703.46s]  a look around i mean it's it's it's tricky i would say that you'd probably bring them in
[8703.46s -> 8708.34s]  and they they we'd have we'd make a place like maybe pile up a bunch of these uh church benches
[8708.34s -> 8713.14s]  and like put make like a cube that we put that person in and they stay in there for like a week
[8713.38s -> 8717.06s]  okay so we like quarantine people yes like even if at least like a day or two and look it's not
[8717.06s -> 8720.82s]  like we're gonna you can we'll feed you we'll make sure you're okay but like just to make sure
[8720.82s -> 8727.77s]  you don't turn in 24 hours all right uh zombie ethics question do you wait until somebody like
[8727.77s -> 8732.65s]  turns into a zombie to shoot them if they're guaranteed like infected no absolutely not
[8732.65s -> 8738.10s]  absolutely no this isn't just part of the decor because that that person can be useful until they
[8738.10s -> 8742.34s]  turn okay but do you tell them that you're gonna do it before you do it or or you like rip the
[8742.66s -> 8745.22s]  it depends on how their immunity is like right some people might get bit and they're
[8745.22s -> 8749.22s]  infected on their attitude like if they suck i'm just gonna do it right now if they're like nice
[8749.22s -> 8756.44s]  there's a lot going on i'll give them a little time there's a lot going on there i think but yes
[8756.44s -> 8761.72s]  if somebody is new they go into the just the cube will make like a little cube so like if they turn
[8761.72s -> 8768.78s]  to a zombie that it can't do anything and then after that and if it's like okay i haven't been
[8768.78s -> 8774.97s]  bitter anything i'm fine and we go all right soldier we like throw like a big gun and they
[8774.97s -> 8783.69s]  catch it and it's like okay geez where are you i'm at the co-op moment we're both at a different
[8783.69s -> 8799.21s]  co-op moment by the way oh are we oh i'll come over there literally the other side yeah the exact
[8799.21s -> 8804.42s]  same ladder well now what do you have to do i have the key item so i put the key item there
[8804.98s -> 8812.26s]  there is a uh over in like the weird um clock holes thing over on the top kind of right side
[8812.26s -> 8816.84s]  there's one of those we have to have two orange slices some some no two grapefruits
[8817.48s -> 8823.32s]  and if we put both the grapefruits the motherly smile will shine upon us and the path will be
[8823.32s -> 8828.04s]  revealed is really important in the old telephone like the old like 19 like 20s telephone up in the
[8828.04s -> 8834.02s]  top with like the good glasses there's one of those blue things to shoot shoot it okay up at
[8834.02s -> 8839.86s]  the top up at the top on like where i'm facing it's on your side it's above you it's on the
[8839.86s -> 8844.06s]  balcony it looks like an old telephone it's a big window with like big telephone holes
[8845.88s -> 8855.82s]  and there's a blue thing to shoot thank you now my uh achievements can be complete i have one
[8855.82s -> 8864.74s]  bullet it's not good all right so then you have to do the puzzle oh you have to knock that down
[8864.74s -> 8876.74s]  my son marco he's in the psaa so am i not supposed to be exploring these rooms you think you're
[8876.74s -> 8879.62s]  supposed to knock down like the candy cane ladder i think okay well i'm gonna take all the loot
[8879.62s -> 8885.10s]  first actually i might be able to i might be able to solve the puzzle actually no you have to pick
[8885.10s -> 8889.58s]  this one up no i can i can do everything it says that you have two it looks just like the other
[8889.58s -> 8900.23s]  statue the question is what are they for i did kick down one okay you got it yep yep but you
[8900.23s -> 8907.77s]  said this stuff up here so i want to get it i think we both have to put a statue on like at
[8907.77s -> 8921.64s]  the same time but on opposite sides okay okay i'm gonna go to this one so i am putting one here
[8925.34s -> 8933.02s]  as he that was huge we probably shouldn't have opened this isn't this supposed to be a safe place
[8933.66s -> 8939.56s]  this is the equipment i'm not gonna no i'm not gonna do it i refuse to
[8941.56s -> 8948.47s]  there's a scene in pop culture media from the not too distant past this reminds me of
[8948.47s -> 8955.30s]  well don't ruin the don't spawn anything all right just checking to save uh we got everything we can
[8955.30s -> 8961.30s]  go i mean uh a media property with undead where the heroes go into the belly of the crypt in
[8961.30s -> 8965.29s]  order to get away from the other is nothing it's not referencing anything how do you well how do
[8965.29s -> 8980.14s]  you dive all right it's like space we have to be aimed at we said i'm sick of you um uh there that
[8981.26s -> 8987.32s]  why is it i thought that was you that didn't i can't i can't shoot this no this is you do
[8987.32s -> 8990.76s]  i what am i supposed to do just dive what am i supposed to how what do i do about this can you
[8990.76s -> 8996.34s]  help what do you do i i'm stuck on the other side is there something you can shoot oh i think i can
[8996.34s -> 9004.33s]  just i like how your first order of business was to immediately blame me well i don't know
[9004.89s -> 9010.68s]  what now it's your turn you just you just saw me do it you now you know what to do
[9010.68s -> 9018.52s]  didn't even get hit once why did they both come out at the same time when that wouldn't have caused
[9018.52s -> 9022.68s]  some chaos in the comms like oh my god what's this oh you got it too oh this is shooting both
[9022.68s -> 9027.53s]  like we could have had a little pain yeah let me get a little yeah this games time for this all
[9027.53s -> 9033.64s]  right it's me versus you we're gonna see point scores i guess you can't decide that in the middle
[9034.36s -> 9044.26s]  oh yeah oh somebody got hit i see somebody got hit oh it looks like somebody's gonna get hit
[9044.26s -> 9051.24s]  twice okay get a fucking close-up stop me just keep moving why is the activation button suddenly
[9051.24s -> 9065.43s]  space when before it was always v for the entire rest of the game it's fair when do you are they
[9065.43s -> 9070.25s]  even happening on your side or am i the only one doing this no they're happening are you just
[9070.33s -> 9083.03s]  watching me it's probably gonna be three now okay now it's your turn okay that one wasn't fair
[9083.03s -> 9092.70s]  oh shit all right this one's this one's kind of unfair fucking move after yeah exactly
[9093.74s -> 9110.50s]  why can i hit this one oh got him get up oh uh-oh a little having a little trouble over here on this
[9110.50s -> 9127.32s]  side looks like i was fine until you came over oh my god dude oh the rule of threes
[9128.04s -> 9138.62s]  you gotta have three separate sessions of the same event the developers of this game played
[9138.62s -> 9149.22s]  too much mario okay we're good okay let's go who is he talking to i i have no idea
[9149.22s -> 9154.86s]  i think you have to aim at this i'm just one of the voices inside your head
[9155.74s -> 9164.20s]  watch out what watch out for what i think you have to aim this or do i have to aim this
[9168.97s -> 9175.30s]  why is it heating up uh i don't i think you have to aim it there's no way for me to move it
[9177.85s -> 9186.41s]  oh hey dude aim your gun at mine aim your gun at mine aim your laser at mine okay okay
[9187.05s -> 9192.71s]  why is it not working oh you meant like at the thing behind you yeah yeah listen uh
[9192.71s -> 9197.11s]  grammatically speaking the nearest antecedent you said aim your laser at mine so i was aiming
[9197.75s -> 9204.60s]  my laser at your laser and then our lasers touch your words are using it too big dumb it down
[9214.71s -> 9218.39s]  where are you i'm coming up there's a guy on my side i think i have to wait for you
[9219.19s -> 9227.93s]  why is it here can we not open this there's a there's a door there's a door but it doesn't
[9228.65s -> 9235.69s]  it doesn't have a prompt is there a laser oh yeah there is you're gonna have a laser on your side
[9236.86s -> 9242.89s]  uh kind of overlooking the did you throw a grenade at me did you did did you throw a
[9242.89s -> 9249.78s]  grenade at me just yes or no it's a very simple question yes okay your honor okay aim your laser
[9249.78s -> 9257.90s]  at the thing back there what over the look oh that way here no yeah it's not throw grenade at friend
[9257.90s -> 9265.05s]  and kill friend i'm just trying to increase my chances for the scorecard at the end i had like
[9265.05s -> 9280.55s]  full health too what the fuck uh yeah there's a dude again oh this one's a mirror oh my goodness
[9280.55s -> 9290.14s]  please just die dude all right so this one's a mirror yeah okay looks yeah so i'm aiming at one
[9290.14s -> 9304.97s]  oh yeah doing it right and we're free very good the madonna of sorrow this is no puzzles in this
[9304.97s -> 9312.87s]  game the rilling somebody said this is thrilling oh yeah and shit talking the streams yeah that's
[9312.87s -> 9323.61s]  a sniper rifle i'm gonna get the sniper if you didn't oh yeah yep did you shoot this
[9323.61s -> 9334.23s]  key oh you have to shoot something to open the gate for the key item or the bells all right so
[9334.23s -> 9344.02s]  you look like you got this down but to do them like all this this three they're fourth uh they
[9344.02s -> 9355.43s]  might be a fourth all the way at the end yeah there's one more down there is there even a bell
[9356.46s -> 9373.98s]  i don't yeah i don't see anything over there uh uh there's no there's definitely nowhere to go
[9373.98s -> 9388.36s]  over here it's a it's a secret hidden bell can we go up oh it's definitely there uh told the five
[9388.36s -> 9397.72s]  bells loud and clear and that's the truth i see it cheeky it's on the uh oops did that work where
[9397.72s -> 9405.88s]  is it spin i don't know if i just made this way harder to do oh wait is this supposed to you see
[9406.04s -> 9412.28s]  it is spinning this is that five uh not quite i think i shot the actual weather
[9412.28s -> 9418.86s]  vein instead of the bell and made it spin faster i think that's ringing is there a fifth bell
[9418.86s -> 9425.24s]  one two three four on the oh yeah there's one back there yep i know where it is i get it teamwork
[9433.05s -> 9447.93s]  it was another rooster feels bad man very nice somebody said god this game sucks
[9448.81s -> 9454.89s]  wait you don't like you don't like two straight hours of non-stop action followed by two straight
[9454.89s -> 9462.34s]  hours of puzzles no did you hear that it's perfectly balanced i think i want to be the
[9462.34s -> 9471.59s]  sniper of the group you can't you picked melee i got crit yeah i didn't unlock melee i said i was
[9471.59s -> 9475.35s]  thinking about doing melee but i could be sniper rifle actually i don't think you said i think you
[9475.35s -> 9479.67s]  said i'm gonna be the melee guy it's very definitive get the fuck over there and do what
[9479.67s -> 9489.35s]  you're supposed to do this is what you're supposed to do you can't shoot the chandelier down why
[9489.35s -> 9497.82s]  not all right you can be the sniper sniper sucks and uh also everyone's just gonna make fun you
[9497.82s -> 9503.98s]  know if you miss because the the shaky cam is is so extreme while zooming in it's actually not bad
[9503.98s -> 9526.30s]  did you turn your um turn your aiming down did she stop drinking so much oh boss okay so when
[9526.30s -> 9534.12s]  they listen i understand umbrella umbrellas everywhere but how do people trapped in ancient
[9534.12s -> 9541.30s]  crypt chambers get infected like this like that yeah but like nobody nobody had opened that
[9541.30s -> 9548.66s]  potentially for centuries you know i'm saying yeah we just did it so who put the zombie there
[9549.22s -> 9555.54s]  and then resealed it no no you're not you're not doing protocol put them over in the cube
[9555.54s -> 9559.86s]  first saving them put them in the cube rifles put them in the cube first that's protocol

[9602.78s -> 9607.70s]  fucking incendiary grenade at me as a joke and took off six cubes of health maybe you should have
[9607.70s -> 9614.62s]  begun the inventory in the practice rules all right if you have a trypophobia you should probably
[9614.62s -> 9627.16s]  look away from this all right oh shit time to get some distance i'm gonna put a bomb down here be
[9627.16s -> 9633.59s]  careful i'm gonna try to get aggro hey look over here you big stupid alien hey clear comms clear

[9815.10s -> 9827.98s]  an npc came up and looted the key item that would be so funny it just runs away make sure
[9827.98s -> 9837.62s]  we don't miss anything this is important their blood is on your hands no their blood is on this
[9837.62s -> 9843.03s]  thing's hands this thing came in we think about how many more people would have died if we weren't

[9872.22s -> 9879.54s]  okay all right stuff died up here right technically it's probably it's probably
[9879.54s -> 9885.91s]  civilians that died i don't know if they drop anything by the way have you noticed any significant
[9885.91s -> 9890.76s]  increase in stuff that's dropped on the ground because i have not and we have both have that
[9890.76s -> 9896.76s]  perk i feel like it's not doing anything it's kind of hard to say it felt like there was a bunch of
[9896.76s -> 9901.32s]  stuff but that was also a boss fight so they kind of have to like litter the floor with things to
[9901.32s -> 9913.56s]  yeah not soft lock you all right we're uh ready to move perk does so little hard compatibility

[9937.75s -> 9942.15s]  characters we have a magnet like attraction to progressively more difficult enemies they're
[9942.15s -> 9946.31s]  literally safer the further they are away from us have you seen all the vehicular explosions
[9946.31s -> 9949.43s]  and you need to be general chaos looking out for us right now i need to blow my nose

[10328.74s -> 10333.83s]  channel will be up it will be very specific rules so make sure you follow the rules advertising on
[10333.83s -> 10336.95s]  my stream you're supposed to i'm supposed to be muted on you why am i even on your stream you're
[10336.95s -> 10341.99s]  supposed to have muted me you unmuted to talk yeah but i should be deafened on your stream
[10342.63s -> 10345.59s]  yeah but i turned it on in case you wanted to like i don't know
[10346.31s -> 10353.19s]  be entertaining or something i don't know that's not my responsibility what the fuck dude listen i
[10353.19s -> 10362.68s]  just oh all right i won't be able to force this one open now what's your favorite pie
[10364.73s -> 10370.74s]  uh put me on the spot depends sometimes sometimes it's key line but not often
[10370.74s -> 10376.58s]  sometimes whoa you're a key lime pie that's why it's a context that's actually that's very
[10376.58s -> 10382.66s]  surprising pecan pecan would be like always okay or pecan depending on your regional preferences
[10383.22s -> 10385.54s]  key lime is an interesting choice though i don't know if i'd put that up there
[10386.42s -> 10394.41s]  that's why i said sometimes we have to go this way somehow if i if i had like a coffee i feel like
[10394.41s -> 10404.76s]  key lime is pretty good key lime and coffee what the fuck are you drugs are you on uh all right
[10404.76s -> 10409.80s]  how do we get in there it's key key lime may just be like a leftover memory from like a nostalgic
[10410.28s -> 10414.20s]  like olive garden experience or something do they have key lime pie at olive garden
[10414.20s -> 10420.06s]  they probably do i was somebody's go this way somebody's in here you have to shoot a lock open
[10421.83s -> 10428.23s]  homemade key lime with graham cracker crust yeah that's that's a combo the key lime has way too
[10428.23s -> 10434.90s]  big of a range for me of being awful to being very good it it really varies sometimes i've had
[10434.90s -> 10438.98s]  key lime pie before and it just tasted like fucking acid it just tastes like it's great okay but we
[10439.06s -> 10445.14s]  have to weigh everything at their best right okay all right like pumpkin pie at its best is still
[10445.14s -> 10453.42s]  worse well hold on pecan pie i would have agreed with you but i recently had pumpkin pie and
[10454.14s -> 10461.27s]  it was cold it was not hot and i think that changed everything for me uh how do we what
[10461.27s -> 10466.20s]  are we supposed to be doing here can we shoot that we're supposed to be looking we can look
[10466.20s -> 10473.11s]  in through these there was the blue box that you broke over here that was just loot why would you
[10473.11s -> 10478.10s]  eat a hot pumpkin pie i don't know do you eat pumpkin pie hot who eats pumpkin pie hot because
[10478.10s -> 10487.98s]  like the only right way to eat pumpkin pie is with whipped cream on top like whip uh i just
[10487.98s -> 10493.78s]  pressed bunch of i just pressed a bunch of buttons oh there's a guy kill that guy okay you got it
[10493.78s -> 10506.23s]  okay how about now that one's open what's the one on the on the end you're right yeah there's just
[10506.23s -> 10516.02s]  a second guy his head fell off whipped cream is not gross why would you say that whipped cream is
[10516.58s -> 10525.30s]  amazing whipped cream is disgusting i am fucking pissed right now what i'm seeing that a lot i'm
[10525.30s -> 10533.19s]  seeing people that keep saying it it's because they're uh they're wrong is it what what do they
[10533.19s -> 10538.23s]  just want to get they just want to get try zero uh oh no we have to guess the number it's a
[10538.23s -> 10543.19s]  combination there's a zero one and two in different orders so it's not the two is not at the end all
[10543.19s -> 10552.04s]  right 102 this that's a bad guy uh i'll open the other one what was it probably 201 he was taking
[10552.44s -> 10558.54s]  he was he was on the pee break too all right they're all open yeah whipped cream is great
[10559.86s -> 10565.80s]  it's really light it can go with anything if he's dead or not whipped cream really goes with
[10565.80s -> 10573.82s]  everything how am i getting hit by your pistol right now i don't know nobody behind us right
[10573.82s -> 10591.70s]  no yeah there is one thing listen if i have to say something good about this game it's that if
[10591.70s -> 10598.18s]  they're gonna throw 600 enemies at least headshots actually kill unlike every other resident evil
[10598.18s -> 10611.86s]  game dude i okay real whipped cream is great i agree did i strike a nerve i think all whipped
[10611.86s -> 10618.62s]  cream is great i don't know what what's the hate to whip cream am i muted right now oh hey you are
[10618.62s -> 10625.77s]  you a muted for a second sorry what were you saying yeah i was just saying actually get the
[10625.77s -> 10632.76s]  thing the only right way to eat whipped cream is uh 60 40 ratio 60 percent whipped cream
[10632.76s -> 10643.16s]  okay all right it's oh it's two okay it's two i don't know two one zero okay we're gonna i'm
[10643.16s -> 10649.46s]  gonna help you the two is not at the end actually could be no it's definitely it's two one it's two
[10649.46s -> 10665.90s]  one zero yeah it is c what would you say like that like i didn't i wasn't disputing anything
[10665.90s -> 10671.66s]  no no i'm talking about chat too chat is really being they're saying that that whipped cream is
[10671.66s -> 10680.62s]  not that great real what's the best the best pie what's the best pie um it's banana cream pie
[10682.15s -> 10685.67s]  that's a good pie but you already know where i stand on this and it doesn't matter
[10685.67s -> 10692.46s]  banana pudding is superior no it there's no crust though don't open one something too don't open
[10692.46s -> 10702.34s]  one all right i'm gonna open zero two one i think that was the right one it's a banana cream pie
[10702.90s -> 10709.78s]  banana cream pie and um chocolate cream pie and my favorites okay i can respect the chocolate
[10709.78s -> 10715.35s]  cream pie what about one two zero these are gonna if we want to get the loot we have to open all
[10715.35s -> 10724.65s]  the doors okay well let's do it but let me put a bomb in front of the the big boys one what was
[10724.65s -> 10733.93s]  that about headshots a second ago oh he morphed chocolate cream pie actually dodged that's what
[10734.01s -> 10743.18s]  you're supposed to do i think don't worry i got this no i'm laughing at the fact that auto mod
[10743.18s -> 10756.31s]  is deleting cream pie auto mod does not want you guys to say that word apparently oh i come
[10756.31s -> 10759.75s]  listen we're not allowed to have whipped cream anymore we're not allowed to have cream pie
[10759.75s -> 10765.75s]  anymore we can't all the words are being stolen from us i'm so sorry mods i just i find that very
[10765.75s -> 10772.54s]  humorous all right two uh two oh one i'm gonna put a bomb right in front of this guy because
[10772.54s -> 10779.29s]  this is like big boy okay if you open that one i'm ready one zero two uh that opened up something
[10779.29s -> 10800.86s]  else it's not even where we are 102 okay is he coming uh here he's coming nice there we go
[10800.86s -> 10818.42s]  and then 201 or 210 what do you think 201 um he didn't die 210 okay hey i got a cut scene
[10818.42s -> 10826.49s]  problem hold on you're right wait you can take cover but why is what's the point is this mechanic
[10827.70s -> 10833.46s]  oh because we're gonna run into all the shooting zombies i do more than no well what have i not
[10833.46s -> 10845.13s]  done 201 what oh two one no i think no gates because that one on the left can be two codes
[10845.13s -> 10862.94s]  yeah it's probably it's oh one two that's all of them yeah banana cream pie is at the top chocolate
[10862.94s -> 10869.61s]  cream pie is at the top as well somewhere there but i would not pick pie as a dessert i think it's
[10869.61s -> 10875.43s]  like pretty low for me wow what about cobbler that's kind of gross whatever i don't think
[10875.43s -> 10885.11s]  that's i think that's gross what you just said cobbler like alamode um like i don't like fruits
[10885.11s -> 10888.71s]  i don't like warm fruit like people think i'm crazy but not like an apple pie that's why
[10888.71s -> 10895.77s]  alamo you get the hot and cold no no it's not that's just i don't like it i didn't know i was
[10895.77s -> 10910.10s]  i didn't know i was friends with a cobbler hater it changes the dynamic oh nice um yeah i don't
[10910.10s -> 10915.46s]  like apple pie it seems like a messier pie what pie just seems like a messier cake so where do we
[10915.46s -> 10921.83s]  draw the line but i don't like turnovers either though you just don't like you don't like anything
[10921.83s -> 10926.31s]  with fruit no i don't like warm fruit it's like warm fruit filling it kind of just reminds me it's
[10926.31s -> 10934.52s]  like a dog vomit or something candy apple it's like human puke it's i don't like it human puke
[10934.52s -> 10946.01s]  you have the appetite of a five-year-old because i don't like apple pie maybe you just haven't had
[10946.01s -> 10952.09s]  a good one okay apple pie is only good with ice cream but then so is cobbler and most fruit based
[10952.09s -> 10956.81s]  yeah but are we going to judge the merits of a dessert based on adding another dessert to make
[10956.81s -> 10962.33s]  it better i think if you allow whipped cream you have to no i don't think so that's a secondary
[10962.33s -> 10966.98s]  thing you have to then we have to judge everything with no whipped cream that's fine banana cream
[10966.98s -> 10970.98s]  pie without the whipped cream is fine oh wait a minute cream in it wait a minute it's actually
[10970.98s -> 10980.14s]  not yeah first of all it's not second of all it cream is in the name cobbler alamo is that's
[10980.14s -> 10984.38s]  that's a whole ass dessert why do you order five of those from mcdonald's i don't i don't
[10984.38s -> 10993.48s]  order five apple pies wait yeah but mcdonald's apple pie is good must be close a good banana
[10993.48s -> 10998.92s]  cream pie is important it's very simple to make but it's impossible to master people go oh i i've
[10998.92s -> 11006.28s]  got the best banana cream pie son have it and it's dog shit it's fucking disgusting i i've had ramsey
[11006.28s -> 11011.00s]  of banana cream pie i'm serious like yeah i've had banana cream pie that was like mealy and mushy and
[11011.00s -> 11017.16s]  it was supposed to be my secret recipe it was awful that's true what does tiramisu fit in this
[11017.16s -> 11025.94s]  um i like it but i wouldn't put it that high i think that's i think tiramisu and the banana
[11025.94s -> 11031.38s]  cream pie share a kinship which is a million different tiramisu exists but really like one
[11031.38s -> 11036.42s]  percent of them are are like 10 out of 10 but that's what i mean like it's it's really hard to
[11036.42s -> 11046.78s]  gauge some of these desserts because sometimes they can be made so poorly it's also it's also
[11046.78s -> 11052.36s]  like you know that's how i judge streams like 99 percent of them are shit but like the one percent
[11052.36s -> 11060.90s]  that are good you know those are the ones that get me i'll be talking about this one are we in
[11060.90s -> 11072.68s]  the one percent who knows time will tell i'm just waiting for people to
[11076.04s -> 11080.09s]  i'm gonna make them you can go ahead and make the don't make the joke if you want
[11080.09s -> 11084.73s]  germa for fuck's sake manage your inventory i don't there's an audit where's there an
[11084.73s -> 11099.06s]  inventory what are you talking about manage my inventory where over there are they pointing
[11099.06s -> 11103.22s]  at the screen i don't know that people someone got really mad i don't like there is no inventory
[11103.78s -> 11107.74s]  this is resident evil six i just made i just made some more crunchies
[11108.54s -> 11126.17s]  to resurrect you if later hold on ice manage it elbow drop oh shit
[11127.45s -> 11132.60s]  imagine i thought that was a person whoa real-time reflections in 2012

[11166.10s -> 11173.24s]  enough away to not get hurt i i actually shot it it could have been me someone just asked me if i
[11173.24s -> 11180.92s]  saw the dollhouse strings i'm currently hey dude you see those trees man did you see those dollhouse
[11180.92s -> 11189.19s]  streams well what if you didn't you maybe you didn't you may have been busy i don't know

[11293.70s -> 11301.46s]  annoying to look at it's too much it's like my arm plus you would probably use four as a dick
[11301.46s -> 11307.26s]  so why you do i really have to tell you why i have no idea what you're talking about

[11625.69s -> 11632.54s]  over there okay but i have to pull this lever which has a high probability of causing problems
[11633.10s -> 11643.30s]  so that gets us back out here i get it we have to stretch this level out
[11643.30s -> 11655.82s]  because we spend a lot of time on the art assets watch out god oh my goodness

[11911.21s -> 11924.60s]  how long is this game uh this is the leon section so it's pretty long the 30 hour game it's like 40
[11924.60s -> 11933.19s]  hours why that's way too long they just started developing and then couldn't stop and then just
[11933.19s -> 11940.41s]  added 16 waves to each arena that they made i was gonna shoot you too that's horseshit
[11942.89s -> 11950.31s]  there are four different campaigns and you will be able to see those campaigns if you decide to
[11950.31s -> 11973.38s]  buy this game when it goes on steam every year for like three dollars screamer really i thought he
[11973.38s -> 11988.30s]  was dead sniped over your shoulder you're welcome thanks uh-oh help me out whoa turned to ice he had
[11988.30s -> 11996.30s]  a nitrogen tank or whatever it was i'm clearly the sniper of the group that's fine i'll be the
[11996.30s -> 12009.82s]  melee guy i think we have to open this door yep is it like a duel it's a double yeah this campaign
[12009.82s -> 12016.26s]  has the best story what's the story i like the part where they release the virus and the entire
[12016.26s -> 12023.45s]  city engulfs in flames you know what who has a harder life a civilian in a resident evil
[12023.45s -> 12030.82s]  franchise or like in the marvel universe because i feel like in both the city is constantly exploded
[12030.82s -> 12035.70s]  and nobody ever has to like actually clean up i've seen marvel for sure because like like somebody
[12035.70s -> 12043.40s]  can literally just drop like a kamehameha on you and kill like a million people yeah i like that
[12043.40s -> 12050.73s]  part in spider-man why can't you fill me in yet i mean literally the plot of infinity war is it
[12050.73s -> 12054.49s]  all right spoilers for infinity war if you haven't seen the fucking goddamn movie by this point
[12054.49s -> 12062.28s]  but like the whole plot of infinity war is that everybody dies right no no no no like i in i'm
[12062.28s -> 12066.52s]  the spoiler for if you haven't seen infinity where then okay you don't watch television
[12066.52s -> 12073.70s]  all right but i got i got an idea what about time travel though look if you put me into like a
[12073.78s -> 12076.98s]  grocery store and i have like 500 cans of shit boyardee and i put boards up
[12078.66s -> 12082.02s]  like mr mr like electricity man is not gonna be able to get into the building
[12086.60s -> 12092.12s]  right like i'll be fine like i just worry about zombies yeah but this is a this is a pathogen that
[12092.12s -> 12099.88s]  infects everybody possibly in the entire world like there's four campaigns you don't know this
[12099.88s -> 12106.60s]  could be like a globetrotting yeah but okay who's that little that guy that's like yes oh you're a
[12106.60s -> 12111.88s]  wizard too i am me as well oh i'm going to torture you and professor coral no no no he's
[12111.88s -> 12115.48s]  in the marvel movies is that guy like oh yeah he puts his hands up and he moves his hands around
[12115.48s -> 12121.98s]  people fly around and shit is like the doctor strange fight oh yes thanos i am your most
[12121.98s -> 12128.33s]  lovely lieutenant what's this they call him like the ma right i'm afraid of that guy i'm not afraid
[12128.33s -> 12137.91s]  of a zombie what about resident evil 2 zombies though what about mr x maybe but i can run away
[12137.91s -> 12145.67s]  from mr x if just run away from thanos if the if ma puts his hand up and points at me 500 light
[12145.67s -> 12149.27s]  poles are going to stab me through the chest like it's different we don't we don't have space
[12149.27s -> 12154.39s]  bearing technology that i know of in resident evil but like in in marvel they could just run
[12154.39s -> 12158.31s]  away like thanos still can't go faster than light he has to like catch you you could just
[12159.27s -> 12162.79s]  you ever see the the best star wars movie the last jedi you know how the ships are just constantly
[12162.79s -> 12166.23s]  like uh running away from each other it's just one long spaceship chase it could be like that
[12166.23s -> 12181.21s]  you just really have to say star wars my brain just shrank to the size of a pea
[12184.87s -> 12193.77s]  let's just get her out of here and then i'll tell you everything i promise communication between the

[13226.58s -> 13232.62s]  this is resident evil it's like just i was gonna think of something funny to say after that to
[13232.62s -> 13237.26s]  like make it look like that was me like saying that was funny but like i just couldn't think of
[13237.26s -> 13243.37s]  anything afterwards so i just made it just sounded like i just said you were dumb i'm i did not mean
[13243.37s -> 13247.94s]  it like that i was trying to think of something funny to say yeah but i was just making fun of
[13247.94s -> 13251.78s]  the game so you just said the game is because that's what happened that's what's happening right
[13251.78s -> 13258.18s]  now just keep your eyes on me this is the hidden backstory lore of these two characters we didn't
[13258.18s -> 13270.52s]  even know knew each other before now all right let's see what they have to say oh they're related
[13270.52s -> 13280.73s]  see that changes the whole dynamic no we knew that before didn't we i i didn't was i supposed
[13280.73s -> 13290.42s]  to i think we knew that before i have amnesia i helped simmons breach the president's security
[13292.01s -> 13300.41s]  name five characters in the game okay um leon debora ada debora helena lana long story is what
[13300.41s -> 13305.88s]  i don't think wesker's in this he's he's in every game isn't he he's definitely in like a lord
[13305.88s -> 13315.06s]  document at least we're up against the people who really run in a very dangerous game and if you
[13315.06s -> 13332.68s]  don't well that's not fair because there's only five characters in the game simmons there's five
[13333.32s -> 13342.84s]  hunnigan simmons okay we were in a voice call with someone but someone on video call overheard us
[13344.31s -> 13354.90s]  i guess by the way leon uh what happened um well we have a rank so i you know good job
[13355.62s -> 13360.01s]  double that's double a well what was the weapon that you were using for the most part
[13360.65s -> 13365.14s]  i mean i was a sniper remember nice you get to zoom in and just put it on somebody's back
[13365.94s -> 13380.22s]  yeah that that sucked that chapter was awful all right but i liked it better than being stuck
[13380.22s -> 13387.10s]  outside the mansion five times in a row because at least we got like a cool minecart segment
[13388.58s -> 13392.50s]  i actually have um all jokes aside i'm actually having this is actually a fun game i actually
[13392.50s -> 13398.73s]  don't care i mean it's not a good game but i'm having fun with the game as far as like resident
[13398.73s -> 13404.17s]  evils go i think this game aged better because it came on the heels of resident evil five
[13405.37s -> 13410.49s]  i mean resident evil five is way better by like a thousand percent that's what i mean there's
[13410.49s -> 13415.21s]  been time to breathe and we can acknowledge that it's shitty and like play it on purpose and
[13415.21s -> 13421.38s]  enjoy it in spite of itself all right we i got money we got money what's important here
[13421.38s -> 13425.62s]  it's not melee melees actually maybe it is here's the thing you have to decide whether to drop one
[13425.62s -> 13431.78s]  of your three or upgrade one of the existing ones for like more like i have crit that i can upgrade
[13434.58s -> 13449.98s]  oh i would probably want to break out no no no no no no how much more damage does the melee do
[13449.98s -> 13462.46s]  is it significant that's a lot of money not significant it only affects the knife oh that's
[13462.46s -> 13471.94s]  awful uh honestly defense level one kind of a new perk but feels like it'd be strong you're seeing
[13472.82s -> 13483.00s]  a critical hit sounds good rock steady no eagle eye if i'm gonna do sniper there's a
[13484.47s -> 13497.46s]  that magnification i only have eight thousand i spent all my money i don't know what to do i'm
[13497.46s -> 13503.88s]  dropping breakout we're just not getting grabbed how do you get rid of it uh you have to mount
[13503.88s -> 13508.92s]  you have to like escape or did we do oh i hit escape how do i unescape i didn't oh shit you
[13508.92s -> 13515.56s]  just did the cut the timer's gone oh no i only have two skills because game is using the escape
[13515.56s -> 13526.50s]  key both to progress and also to go back to like change the skills out i'm doing crits level two
[13526.50s -> 13536.06s]  i can't cancel the countdown i'm just stuck here okay um i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm
[13536.06s -> 13548.09s]  firearm no i don't know what to do about quick reload that sounds good to me quick reload sounds
[13548.09s -> 13563.02s]  good to me all right i think i'm okay with this i still have 8 000 points good so now one second
[13563.02s -> 13579.11s]  okay i think i'm good the president spoke highly of you agent kennedy like which one's agent kennedy
[13579.11s -> 13590.46s]  told me you were the only ones present at the time of his death what are you saying how do you know
[13590.46s -> 13599.58s]  a character is evil when they talk like you must be aware i'm the bad guy of this game at the time
[13599.58s -> 13604.22s]  of the attack um there's other characters that have talked like that in that tone that were good
[13612.46s -> 13616.46s]  although i can see this actor leaning into the microphone with his hand up
[13616.46s -> 13621.32s]  curling his fingers around while he says every line he's he's gripping the microphone
[13621.32s -> 13629.35s]  but just yeah he has like glasses on down at his nose looking down at the script his hand is up
[13640.54s -> 13643.66s]  someone said dude we can't even hear the game we don't know what you're talking about
[13643.66s -> 13650.38s]  is it really that low the the dialogue's low but the action's loud it's one of the it's not even
[13650.38s -> 13657.26s]  specific to this game that's like every video game and movie is it that hard to mix audio yeah like
[13657.26s -> 13662.54s]  sound effects mean gunshots and like footsteps and when the gunshots literally blow out your
[13662.54s -> 13670.04s]  eardrums and like everything else is too low yeah i know what you mean like you can't watch a movie
[13670.04s -> 13676.60s]  at home without having the remote in your hand the entire movie to just make micro adjustments
[13676.60s -> 13684.07s]  up and down yeah it's like you sit there and you just go like plus plus plus plus plus plus
[13684.07s -> 13688.07s]  during dialogue scenes and then when you know an explosion it sucks because you've been in that
[13688.07s -> 13693.99s]  position where like you're the quarterback of the television of the living room of the experience
[13693.99s -> 13699.03s]  you have to anticipate the next explosion and go down down down down down it sucks and you have to
[13699.03s -> 13703.43s]  get good at guessing what other people you may be watching with if you're watching like a party or
[13703.43s -> 13709.99s]  something yeah like how comfortable is another person with the audio being loud or quiet you
[13709.99s -> 13714.87s]  know like i have to i have to gauge that and it kind of like fucks up your viewing experience
[13714.87s -> 13719.74s]  because you have to think of two steps ahead of the movie oh there you go
[13721.69s -> 13734.44s]  bus lemon say yes you can you get all those things yeah i'm getting some loot you get it do you need
[13734.44s -> 13744.47s]  help how do you oh i got it i think i actually have to help you do this or something can you is
[13744.47s -> 13753.26s]  it like a co-op moment because it's like i'm i'm i'm pushing can you like v next to it yo you're
[13753.26s -> 13766.09s]  lied he's lied okay yeah oh there's a snake in there it was a jump kill that it has a golden
[13766.09s -> 13772.02s]  thing right that was actually pointless oh wait i thought that all the snakes in resident evil if
[13772.02s -> 13783.19s]  you kill them they have like money will drop and stuff annoying all the only things scarier
[13783.19s -> 13790.70s]  than zombies are skeletons it's called skyrim level this is kind of look like a skyrim dungeon
[13791.66s -> 13814.10s]  oh oh look what you found i walked right by this salt rifle nice so does every campaign reset your
[13814.10s -> 13819.70s]  entire loadout to zero i guess it does it's two different characters each time so yeah probably
[13827.64s -> 13832.50s]  down what you had down watch it watch it i think we have to slide on it crawling me
[13833.30s -> 13842.86s]  this people a lot of people over there follow them back here
[13844.23s -> 13851.67s]  we don't even use bullets pull them up pull them back here just let them die this is gonna be so
[13851.67s -> 13860.07s]  cinematic in about 30 seconds when they get over here each campaign has different weapons so that's
[13860.07s -> 13870.54s]  cool uh one of them learns to crawl oh i'm trying to help you well that was dumb i hate when zombies
[13870.54s -> 13876.70s]  are smart in media okay just make them dumb they're more scary that way because if they have
[13876.70s -> 13880.78s]  intelligence then what if you're eliminating a new intelligent life form that you're simply
[13880.78s -> 13885.10s]  too intimidated by dameron to stand up dameron to stand up and go back down i think you're good
[13886.06s -> 13894.20s]  i think i could probably get i'll tell you right now this is very important
[13894.20s -> 13898.60s]  that's strike two you got one more throw incendiary grenade at jeremy when he's doing
[13898.60s -> 13905.86s]  something you got one more you got one more that's strike three catch me if you can
[13911.99s -> 13919.96s]  okay i almost walked into if i if there was a drop kick button i could confirm would have
[13919.96s -> 13929.62s]  drop kicked you into it i may have done it why would you do he was just he's he likes fire he's
[13929.62s -> 13936.14s]  a pirate we have to go over here not going that way unless like playing with fire first person
[13936.14s -> 13947.91s]  to run into the blades gets ten dollars what do i look like a like a streamer uh the deal is
[13947.91s -> 13962.46s]  out me out for ten dollars i think i have to boost you so i good luck okay i think i have to just sit
[13962.46s -> 13974.66s]  down here what is happening do i have to do some oh oh it is a fast crawl so i just have to defend
[13974.66s -> 13985.61s]  because they're just going to be coming around the corner i'm waiting i'm crawling as fast as i can
[13985.61s -> 13991.14s]  erma don't go into the fire you'll burn your wellington thanks that's a good idea
[13991.14s -> 14001.43s]  i probably shouldn't wellington i want that person to like know that i loved that one
[14002.23s -> 14007.03s]  that was awesome am i supposed to do this as fast as i can or am i like helping you
[14007.83s -> 14018.46s]  ah there's probably kiss and kin kiss and kin simon's family tree i didn't bring any other how
[14018.46s -> 14023.10s]  do you get off of this there we go not related oh we have to aim it i'm gonna sneeze i think they
[14023.10s -> 14031.30s]  left any one let you know uh i sneeze all the time but do it give you a ring your stream not
[14031.30s -> 14038.26s]  on mine do it it was on your stream not on mine i'm sorry i can't mute both wasn't even a sneeze
[14038.26s -> 14042.90s]  it was just like i accidentally startled you when you fell asleep during a movie or something
[14042.90s -> 14055.75s]  the gift data so now should we get ready just changes the fire oh but we can just we have to
[14055.75s -> 14061.77s]  do it uh maybe turn the fire back on though okay i'll tell you when to stop there stop there
[14062.49s -> 14068.92s]  stop actually oh i don't know does it i can do it as many times i want uh they're coming they're
[14068.92s -> 14078.49s]  coming they're thinking about it here comes a good job toasted roasted i'm gonna wait okay more
[14079.21s -> 14087.08s]  are we doing there's uh ones on fire one fell down literally nothing tripped them they just
[14087.08s -> 14092.68s]  fell down what's what happened to you there's people coming out of crypts the okay there's
[14092.68s -> 14102.17s]  people are you all right yeah i'm good don't back up too far i'll be good um soon uh especially
[14102.17s -> 14118.14s]  after i heal oh there's a lot of people here oh they have armor ow that hit you somehow yeah
[14118.14s -> 14122.94s]  that was a finisher move like we have to collect all the shit on the bridge man come on
[14124.47s -> 14127.59s]  all right there's about you get on the thing there's a bunch coming i think you're closer
[14127.59s -> 14133.80s]  well now i'm closer i was getting all the stuff on the bridge all right i'm gonna spin it uh-huh
[14134.44s -> 14139.72s]  okay you spin it and i'll just stand next to you yeah and take care of the people that fall down
[14140.36s -> 14144.90s]  i'm trying but like i'm running out of shotgun shells and that's how i get my accuracy up
[14150.71s -> 14156.02s]  survive the zombie attack i don't even know if there's anybody else coming
[14156.58s -> 14173.94s]  it's where i wish probably take a look and make sure okay you need to do a stream where you try
[14173.94s -> 14181.70s]  to copy gordon ramsey's recipes i don't think i want to do that i've made gordon ramsey's eggs
[14181.70s -> 14193.40s]  before in the pan seer delicious coriander two delicious two two coriander please egg
[14194.04s -> 14205.43s]  crack simmer delicious it always says in by itself looks like we gotta get our feet wet
[14205.43s -> 14213.78s]  oh water oh we're going all over the place they're already using the like they use the
[14213.78s -> 14221.29s]  minecraft boss you got the water boss and this is just in the first chapter stewie griffin no
[14221.29s -> 14228.89s]  that was a gordon ramsey impression that was not stewie griffin i feel like there's something we
[14228.89s -> 14252.39s]  can whatever um okay just keep going that was the reveal for the boss later called foreshadowing
[14254.41s -> 14268.82s]  that means the same thing okay i'll just be doing the crawl animation again i probably have to get
[14268.82s -> 14276.66s]  ready to attack so i'm gonna make sure i'm ready there's someone in here i'm ready for i saw it i
[14276.66s -> 14281.70s]  just saw it i saw it it's coming closer what is that there's something coming closer there's
[14281.70s -> 14294.44s]  something here did i get it kind of on your own i don't know i don't know if i got it i think i
[14294.44s -> 14304.58s]  got it that's kind of hard there was one enemy in that entire tunnel it was just one enemy that's
[14304.58s -> 14315.18s]  weird why you blew up a fish uh there's items i don't have time for items i'm opening the door
[14315.18s -> 14327.26s]  right now what happened uh i have been grabbed and i am being drowned and the fish is got both
[14327.26s -> 14336.90s]  of us actually can you see this yeah okay i don't know if that was a me cut scene or a both of us
[14336.90s -> 14341.94s]  cut scene it sounded like you hit the uh the edge in operation that was just an office camera angle
[14341.94s -> 14354.70s]  of you it was it was the office there's a lot going on i'm oh there's literally no way out we're
[14354.70s -> 14359.90s]  gonna have to reload what there's another zero way out i can't even come to find you yeah i know
[14359.90s -> 14365.91s]  that's why i'm that wasn't me the game just spawned enemies on top of me after i did that
[14366.47s -> 14379.94s]  i hope we have a checkpoint right there oh my god are you okay no this is this is the worst
[14379.94s -> 14385.30s]  okay so i have to snipe that's what it wants me to do all right i'm back keep moving forward
[14385.38s -> 14407.77s]  keep moving forward you got it all right cover me run oh shit okay all right i got you good
[14411.14s -> 14427.21s]  reloading that cannot kill you shut up really your turn it's my turn now you have to help me
[14429.78s -> 14441.29s]  you gotta snipe my side i can't even see you snipe my side please i'm down here all right you you
[14441.29s -> 14453.00s]  seem fine i think i am can you get through now uh there's like an unnecessarily stand up on this
[14453.00s -> 14457.96s]  i'm sorry i'm freaking out for no reason jesus jeremy's just relax how are you supposed to get
[14457.96s -> 14466.92s]  through this why won't i stay on the ground do you turn this off um i think we have to just get
[14466.92s -> 14473.62s]  through both of our like gauntlets i don't think i can turn yours off there's another step jump
[14473.62s -> 14482.57s]  scared me the snake ran into the blue trap okay now just go forward oh it's because i have the
[14482.57s -> 14491.10s]  sniper rifle out that's why okay i'm just warning you there's a non-zero chance of me instant dying
[14491.10s -> 14502.20s]  over here uh i would say the same thing over here too this is incredibly fast and that's
[14502.20s -> 14515.77s]  definitely the way i'm supposed to go um you oh there's a guy there's a guy doing it i stopped
[14515.77s -> 14524.06s]  did i stop yours you stopped him yeah okay nice now i can do yours i think find the crank
[14529.53s -> 14532.25s]  what do you mean it's not even in here you think the developers forgot
[14533.88s -> 14544.02s]  uh this guy went to find a crank um did you find it you what did you just do
[14544.02s -> 14550.90s]  why did you do that i guess that okay there was no reason for you to turn it on yeah yeah there is
[14550.90s -> 14555.78s]  yeah there was this is the only time in the entire game that we've played up to this point
[14555.78s -> 14560.74s]  where a crank didn't do something beneficial i didn't know that was the crank you killed the
[14560.74s -> 14564.66s]  guy that was turning because i just turned a crank over here that opened the door why would
[14564.66s -> 14569.94s]  why would i think that the next crank that looks identical to that would all right well here's you
[14569.94s -> 14575.54s]  with uh sharp objects wait till i get across from this i didn't know what it was i just listen in
[14575.54s -> 14579.86s]  this game up till now you see a lever you pull it and something good happens okay i got baited by
[14579.86s -> 14587.70s]  the devs okay i i don't think i can do anything until you turn this that's not no that's not
[14587.70s -> 14595.53s]  strike three that was not an incendiary grenade close though almost he's close that was a that
[14595.53s -> 14605.82s]  was a foul tip no yeah no that means you caught it okay what do i do now the game tells you
[14606.62s -> 14624.73s]  to pull this why did i put that down oh my god reunite with your partner i'd love to
[14626.14s -> 14633.56s]  why does this not work okay you could just back oh shit he dropped something he dropped something
[14633.56s -> 14648.15s]  there's a key over here or something i shot that guy in the face three times oh man oh man oh man oh
[14648.15s -> 14662.47s]  man oh man oh man oh man all right uh i'm still just kind of chilling over here with the lever
[14662.47s -> 14675.42s]  that kills you why the fuck can i hurt these guys can you pull a lever on your side over there
[14675.42s -> 14681.42s]  there's a lever over here i need to get but it go pull that one but it's protected by these stupid
[14681.42s -> 14686.38s]  spitting guys that's just won't stop and i can't hit them with anything behind you no there's a
[14686.38s -> 14694.47s]  key on the ground over here oh my fucking god what i'm gonna scream at this game if you die
[14694.47s -> 14700.71s]  before i get over there why can i not hit this guy because they're waiting they're waiting for me
[14701.27s -> 14705.91s]  i shot that guy this night what do you have a clay helmet on oh i've got a clay helmet on i'm
[14705.91s -> 14711.11s]  immune to all damage that's that's just basic minecraft progression all right i need to i need
[14711.11s -> 14719.66s]  to get that all right am i really gonna sit here and watch you through the sniper as you slowly
[14719.66s -> 14726.30s]  crawl under the blades when i am near steps away from being on the same exact level as you
[14726.30s -> 14730.78s]  don't understand i have to go that way anyway i have to i have to get the crank you're gonna go
[14730.78s -> 14744.41s]  get the key i got the crank i got it um are you okay why did that happen okay don't look i am
[14744.41s -> 14758.54s]  ready to turn the crank here we go thank you there's nobody coming after me right i hear
[14758.54s -> 14767.35s]  screaming but i don't see anybody all right i am through it's because he was below your line of
[14767.35s -> 14774.52s]  sight ah all right is this crank gonna murder you or i hope not i think it's gonna open this
[14778.52s -> 14791.13s]  oh shit how that there's no okay that was a movie action movie uh how did the bad guy hit only the
[14791.13s -> 14797.37s]  small thin piece of metal with the ricochet but not the person that they were aiming at and now
[14797.37s -> 14801.77s]  i'm now i'm not going to criticize that in a movie ever again i said if resident evil 6 is so bad
[14801.77s -> 14807.53s]  why are you playing it i think it's fun hey if the stream is so bad why are you watching it
[14808.17s -> 14813.94s]  so no don't say that looks like we're finally making it out of here i think i'm having a good
[14813.94s -> 14819.22s]  time this is really fun no yeah this is actually pretty fun game i'm at i'm not messing around i
[14819.22s -> 14827.22s]  really do think this is fun why can we not that was my i was on yours oh well sorry get the levers
[14827.22s -> 14844.26s]  confused somber music you're having fun playing explain the plot then it's a resident evil game
[14844.90s -> 14848.66s]  yeah but like i've played all the dark souls games i have no idea what's going on in the
[14848.66s -> 14864.42s]  dark souls games either or kingdom hearts i still played those you can't jump off the edge i was
[14864.42s -> 14871.72s]  testing you played kingdom hearts back up you didn't play kingdom hearts i mean i yeah i i
[14871.72s -> 14878.20s]  played kingdom hearts so i could watch when you walk away like six times in a row and then that's
[14878.20s -> 14882.62s]  pretty much the only reason i started a new game so i could watch the music video there was more
[14882.62s -> 14899.53s]  after that kingdom hearts one and two we're good there you go i would no i wanted to do that okay
[14899.53s -> 14906.07s]  so how much time is left in this campaign the leon campaign okay is it is it just me it feels like
[14906.07s -> 14909.75s]  listen we're having so much fun but i feel like we've been playing for seven hours but we've only
[14909.75s -> 14914.63s]  been playing for like three and a half just well no longer than that well i mean like the story
[14915.19s -> 14919.67s]  for like four hours but i promise you we're not gonna let simmons get away with all this okay
[14923.83s -> 14931.83s]  i was gonna do a cool snipe and i came out of the cutscene and they're going to kill me
[14932.47s -> 14937.90s]  they're not you just like playing kingdom hearts because when goofy goes
[14939.26s -> 14963.67s]  then that's true when he does what when he says boy i would kill to watch you play gears of work
[14963.67s -> 14970.07s]  co-op i don't think that would have the same charm i don't want to play gears of war i'd say
[14970.07s -> 14976.63s]  it's a the game it's it's cool i played it a lot like a long time ago but no i don't really think
[14976.63s -> 14984.84s]  so that would be like it would be so boring in comparison somebody said yeah i don't that really
[14984.84s -> 14989.56s]  is just to take cover and shoot there's nothing else going on especially like the first two of
[14989.56s -> 14996.97s]  them maybe they changed with the formula and like the last ones but i need help it's like okay
[15000.70s -> 15004.70s]  it doesn't have quite the same level of goofy cutscenes
[15009.91s -> 15015.83s]  are we supposed to just go i hate the guys that have the armor it's not fair
[15016.63s -> 15023.88s]  the rts is very good though i did play that the gears of war uh x-com game was actually good
[15024.68s -> 15032.47s]  was it yeah surprisingly here's one and two rule i don't even remember which one i played
[15033.69s -> 15040.81s]  because i definitely only played one of them i did not play like gears of war i don't remember i
[15040.81s -> 15054.94s]  think i feel like it's three they're pretty similar he's still not dead i don't know how
[15054.94s -> 15063.66s]  he's alive i just got inspired to make a beef wellington this christmas did you i thought
[15063.66s -> 15075.91s]  you were saying that i got really inspired i guess i know where i'm gonna be oops oops
[15076.63s -> 15083.02s]  yep it'd be a shame if i didn't click me there thanks for the assist partner i don't want to
[15083.02s -> 15087.10s]  make a beef wellington because beef wellington to me just looks like a weird corn dog hot dog
[15087.10s -> 15094.22s]  raw meat thing i don't want it it's just like a gigantic corn dog but it's raw in the middle
[15094.22s -> 15109.45s]  right out of the freezer but like thought watch out he's blending in okay i got you back okay
[15109.45s -> 15114.63s]  don't know what exploded can we knock the weight limit um i guess this is a cut scene we can't do
[15114.63s -> 15128.81s]  it what is he doing you got this um maybe i don't know nope he turned like 90 i may have planted a
[15128.81s -> 15135.34s]  bomb just wait till we can move away please he's gonna kill you he's gonna hit you right now i
[15135.34s -> 15140.62s]  knew it was gonna happen i knew it was gonna all right i'm in i'm in it we were supposed to
[15140.62s -> 15149.40s]  shoot the bridge oh i you killed me i didn't but i have you ever had a supposed to shoot the bridge
[15149.40s -> 15154.62s]  have you ever had a beef wellington before no okay i know everyone here's like everyone else
[15154.62s -> 15158.62s]  eat vicariously through gordon ramsay videos yeah but people kept kept just kept saying that's a
[15158.62s -> 15163.74s]  shit take worse take has anyone in this chat eaten a beef wellington before i feel like it's like
[15163.74s -> 15170.58s]  three of you i don't think anyone's even had this before listen there's not macaroni and cheese in
[15170.58s -> 15176.38s]  it they probably haven't tasted it i mean macaroni and cheese is based so all right let's get him to
[15176.38s -> 15183.75s]  run all right hurry because there's other guys so now we've when he's on the bridge we that was a
[15183.75s -> 15188.39s]  guy that wasn't me there was a guy to the bridge shoot the bridge shoot the bridge shoot the bridge
[15191.19s -> 15198.89s]  let's just run across the bridge run across the bridge i'm going as fast as i can here he comes
[15200.41s -> 15209.24s]  wait oh god oh fuck okay just how long do you have uh i have a little bit i've got like at least
[15209.24s -> 15215.72s]  five to ten seconds not he's he'll kill me if he gets another go across the bridge
[15215.72s -> 15222.62s]  run up can you get around it we don't just keep going this way there's nothing over here
[15224.31s -> 15237.46s]  this way he's coming he's coming he's coming all right another bridge we get him another place
[15238.98s -> 15247.19s]  there's two what do you mean there's two why is there two this is unfair what we're sandwiched in
[15248.07s -> 15254.94s]  oh my god we're not gonna be able to do this it did like a cut scene i could have revived you
[15254.94s -> 15259.26s]  well yeah this is bullshit because look at how much weight is currently on this thing and it
[15259.26s -> 15269.22s]  didn't fall are you serious listen umbrella uses only the best structural engineers okay how do
[15269.22s -> 15274.42s]  you think they made such a successful mutating campaign they had to start with let's not shoot
[15274.42s -> 15279.66s]  the bridge that didn't do anything okay why don't we just kill i got an idea just both of us plant
[15279.66s -> 15285.34s]  a bomb i'll just plant a bomb right here okay i'm gonna we'll just we'll plant one there don't
[15285.34s -> 15289.34s]  wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait he's coming he's coming so i'm gonna run
[15289.34s -> 15296.94s]  oh no i'm gonna put my what the it won't let it won't let me run don't blow yours up yet
[15298.22s -> 15312.65s]  three two one blow it up wow all right we got dead i'm wasting so much ammo like an idiot
[15314.25s -> 15323.29s]  okay we need to do that again yep but that one's that guy's dead i got incendiary grenades i'm
[15323.29s -> 15342.82s]  just gonna throw it all right he's not coming this way oh god watch out thank you anytime okay get
[15342.82s -> 15350.42s]  some ammo is it this bridge i think it's the next one the one that goes up wait do we go down this
[15350.42s -> 15363.46s]  bridge um yeah it's the other way yeah it's the one that goes up it's easy to get turned around
[15363.54s -> 15372.12s]  in this particular wait area hold on are we stupid here no this is the right way but i think since we
[15372.12s -> 15376.44s]  died they took one of the big boys away to make it easy no he's here here he is i think he's here
[15376.44s -> 15385.74s]  yeah there's a guy behind us careful i'll go you you wait i'll go get him don't go too okay i hit
[15385.74s -> 15393.96s]  him with that throw that i did that guy has a bunch of fucking bombs all over him did it work
[15394.36s -> 15414.95s]  all right i kind of did closer that should be good oh my god die already he's dead okay that's
[15414.95s -> 15425.08s]  not bad watch there be a third one i'm gonna get a grenade out because i feel like this is gonna be
[15425.08s -> 15436.09s]  a third one i get a checkpoint though that's good i don't see another one devs uh can i get some new
[15436.09s -> 15443.58s]  content i need something to react to uh here's somebody i can't i honestly can't the guy just
[15443.58s -> 15447.90s]  spit in my eyes and turned me into rayman okay what's going on you spit in my eyes and turn me
[15447.90s -> 15453.18s]  into rayman just get over here i'm stuck in the animation what he spit on you at the exact moment
[15453.18s -> 15460.06s]  i confirmed that the co-op moment so i'm just over here i'm in the like running crouch animation
[15460.06s -> 15475.48s]  ready to cross are you good thank you you snap me out yeah yeah nice not nice i saw the scene
[15475.48s -> 15480.92s]  of resident evil 5 uh is this the part where i punch the rock while you uh i think you have
[15480.92s -> 15486.44s]  to lower the bridge uh do you see any of these people over here that are crawling up behind me
[15486.44s -> 15491.00s]  i got you i got you i got you i'm not even kidding i seriously do okay this four of them though
[15491.00s -> 15496.36s]  keep crawling crawl crawl go go go go go go go go go i'm crawling is okay i actually just saved
[15496.36s -> 15502.33s]  your life i just that trust me when i say that you actually would have died if i did not do that
[15502.89s -> 15507.88s]  i mean i have full health but sure there were four of them grabbing you i thought you just
[15507.88s -> 15525.13s]  jumped off the edge i feel like i need this oh boy watch out i got big i am i can just snipe
[15525.77s -> 15530.26s]  i'm gonna shoot the big guy just worry about the other guys big guys going down
[15533.02s -> 15540.31s]  shut the hell up that's my character said the guy is still alive he's i've been he's taking a lot
[15540.31s -> 15555.91s]  of damage though all right big guy dead okay cool looking good looks pretty good i want all that
[15555.91s -> 15566.26s]  stuff too though oh there's some there's some juicy skill points i think somebody behind me
[15567.50s -> 15575.74s]  no i am where are you i have you have to put the bridge down here okay i'm going the right way
[15579.48s -> 15587.08s]  i am currently sniping there's people coming over are your way um what the fuck was that
[15587.08s -> 15593.72s]  dynamite what guy had who had dynamite it's like i don't know they're just trapped with dynamite
[15593.72s -> 15607.61s]  for some reason but why did it blow up near me that was i don't understand that we're gonna get
[15607.61s -> 15615.50s]  an auto check he's doing all right he's in the other room this is extremely slow like
[15617.10s -> 15628.01s]  there's nobody coming after you yet oh they are now they're on your side oh i got like 85
[15629.30s -> 15635.70s]  you got a guy right behind you 95 it's over okay now don't be mad at me for running down the whole
[15635.70s -> 15645.11s]  bridge because i want to get all that stuff kill the zigzag he's still alive oh i need bullets
[15645.75s -> 15652.84s]  that was actually really cool yeah the drop kick's fun um but you have to like queue it up let me go
[15652.84s -> 15659.30s]  get this i can't go get this stuff that's so unfair what all i can't get it skill points
[15659.30s -> 15665.59s]  i don't think you do are we as literally a huge rock they had to know let's push it
[15666.23s -> 15677.78s]  derma lost auto in his huge mansion right behind you
[15684.86s -> 15695.51s]  that was very scary did you shoot that guy no he fell all right hold on i need to do this i mean
[15695.51s -> 15701.19s]  we it took both leon and helena to push a rock whereas chris pushed it by itself so i guess he's
[15701.19s -> 15708.14s]  at least as strong as both of us combined first redfield yeah that's the other that's the fifth
[15708.14s -> 15713.75s]  character in this game i wouldn't be surprised he's show i think he has a whole campaign help me
[15714.31s -> 15727.11s]  i don't know what i did can you tell the people behind me to wait oh boy all right watch out
[15727.11s -> 15733.24s]  behind us hey uh manage your inventory real quick and then heal i got it thank you thank
[15733.24s -> 15748.18s]  your name was red it was bothering me oh on the wrong side so okay uh yeah there are noises
[15748.18s -> 15755.29s]  this progress bar i would say we should probably stop right now stop i okay and
[15755.29s -> 15761.24s]  fight how do we get off we're just one person oh come on it falls all the way back
[15765.13s -> 15771.53s]  was that like a developer meme i think that was just like a gotcha moment i was like oh you thought
[15771.53s -> 15778.17s]  you were gonna have to do the entire bridge or we or we fucked it somehow and we like
[15778.17s -> 15786.47s]  fucked it up somehow we gotta go fast i think we fucked it up oh shit are you okay yeah are you
[15786.47s -> 15798.82s]  are you i think so thanks for your concern big boy gotta go um b that was a sonic losing all
[15798.82s -> 15816.44s]  the rings moment you good yep okay you somehow landed there's way too it's too many okay there's
[15816.44s -> 15827.83s]  too much going on are you good i think so jesus are you all right yeah this is ground shaking
[15827.83s -> 15834.47s]  we keep just going you good are you okay oh are you okay man you good you think okay you good
[15835.80s -> 15843.80s]  someone put another two person boulder here that those are the like indiana jones the ones who
[15843.80s -> 15850.76s]  got squashed we made it did you ever think about how difficult it would be to reset the traps in
[15850.76s -> 15855.64s]  those temples they give you just one guy in the trigger all they only have to happen once
[15861.02s -> 15866.30s]  if you're good enough to get into the temple then you're like the earnest level threat yeah but what
[15866.30s -> 15869.82s]  i'm saying is like what if you get what if you like 80 of the way through but the last one gets
[15869.82s -> 15876.17s]  you like they have someone has to go in and reset all the other traps before the next guy comes in
[15878.76s -> 15883.64s]  are we supposed to i know is this a screen saver like what's happening it's just a cut scene
[15884.60s -> 15890.17s]  stop trying to make that a thing no i'm going to continue to try to make that a thing what what
[15890.17s -> 15899.56s]  thing uh earnest um all right so we have to swim earnest christmas special yeah all the earnest
[15899.56s -> 15905.48s]  movies are required reading yeah they're pretty good there's a space bar thing here yeah it says
[15905.48s -> 15913.21s]  perform stroke right oh there's like an air pocket i think wait there's an air pocket yeah you swam
[15913.21s -> 15919.40s]  past it i press spacebar so i get breath well hopefully i find an air pocket up here found an
[15919.40s -> 15934.44s]  air pocket good all right which would you rather do this whole section again or um i give you a
[15934.44s -> 15939.00s]  like ocarina of time water temple save and you have to start there i'd rather do this a thousand
[15939.00s -> 15955.16s]  more times 80 meters all right where's the air pocket i did you which i don't know which way
[15955.16s -> 15960.98s]  did you go i'm i'm like behind you i think i still got half air yeah i have a lot of air too

[16099.51s -> 16103.51s]  where are you you're in them are you in the mouth i thought i was i thought it was this
[16103.67s -> 16107.67s]  you're not gonna let i'm getting bit i thought i was up his ass
[16110.89s -> 16121.94s]  uh i don't know why i thought that okay let's go it's space and r the two dumbest combinations
[16122.66s -> 16141.02s]  i kind of i actually just wanted to see what would happen it's incredible that my human strength
[16142.17s -> 16163.53s]  capable of stopping that okay here we go space and r i'm ready space plus r you fell off fine okay
[16164.41s -> 16179.05s]  uh i got it mine's just mash keys all right i got space plus r ready shiny bit in the in the middle
[16179.77s -> 16194.76s]  all right i'll get it it's like a are we holding our breath this long is what i want
[16194.76s -> 16201.16s]  uh don't worry about that just stab the weak spot together probably probably both of us using a
[16201.16s -> 16210.78s]  spear at the same time i think so are you okay i'm good i'd spam i'm up in the mouth and shadow
[16210.78s -> 16216.71s]  the colossus are you at the stomach i don't know i think i was just like waiting for you
[16217.51s -> 16226.47s]  i was in there hanging out oh now you got the office camera now oh you're in the water with it
[16226.47s -> 16240.87s]  okay find a place to climb up find a place to climb up okay where we're here uh there's a tunnel
[16240.87s -> 16247.45s]  that you can swim through that's over towards me i think they just want you to go through the tunnel
[16247.45s -> 16257.51s]  oh and then i will get jump scared i said i find a thing to climb up i didn't know
[16257.51s -> 16260.87s]  we'd like go through the tunnel and around the whole level i'm looking for like a little ladder
[16260.87s -> 16264.47s]  on the edge oh you thought this was over this we're only like a third of the way through this
[16264.47s -> 16274.84s]  level i think i you you have to open this helena can you do something about these bars i'm working
[16274.84s -> 16283.05s]  on it leave me alone try hold on what if i just left you uh you would die oh you want i see this
[16283.29s -> 16293.51s]  this is testing past mechanics thank you i tried looks like i can get up over there but the fish
[16293.51s -> 16309.03s]  is probably going to jump up is that going to be ready there it is they make it uh are you live
[16309.03s -> 16325.82s]  yes you're welcome i'm telling you mario boss okay one more time we're gonna jump on its head one
[16325.82s -> 16340.50s]  more time uh okay weird spot and what am i supposed to do about this i didn't do anything
[16340.50s -> 16345.88s]  yeah i shot it why is it on the bridge i'm on the bridge above you watching you gotta start
[16345.88s -> 16356.68s]  swimming it's giving me all these prompts and then to take it away from me okay very nice time to
[16356.68s -> 16363.72s]  actually fight the fish right i imagine that's what's happening here hello how are you i made
[16363.72s -> 16370.81s]  it and i am ready to not crawl through this but rather use our combined strength to push it
[16378.01s -> 16390.52s]  okay um defeat the b.o.w why it's slow wait feed it barrels it's got this explosive barrels
[16393.99s -> 16399.59s]  um apparently the edges of the screen i feel like we're going into hyperspace i can't even
[16399.67s -> 16425.16s]  look at this this is a warp gate yeah this sucks um we're good wait for a barrel oh barrel yep
[16425.16s -> 16435.80s]  right now i'm reloading um right i think we're good not kill us i think we're okay did we just
[16435.80s -> 16440.68s]  beat it this is what it's like to get stuck in the water park i feel like we weren't supposed
[16440.68s -> 16457.50s]  to win that fast nice bit rate yeah bit rate is dead yeah i'm in the same we were sliding down
[16457.50s -> 16463.50s]  there for like 45 how did we get outside we were falling through a very long tunnel we would be
[16463.50s -> 16472.73s]  like a thousand meters underground there's a nuke that just went off so they're destroying the place
[16480.01s -> 16485.54s]  you do an impression of daniel day lewis in um where there would be blood sure i actually
[16485.54s -> 16488.82s]  haven't seen that movie
[16489.46s -> 16498.17s]  that's why you are all right that's a good one for when they're attacking leon can we get
[16498.17s -> 16504.17s]  another one with a little bit more uh energy i think that's pretty accurate
[16510.44s -> 16514.36s]  somebody said i that was a bad impression because i hate that movie that's not how it works
[16515.54s -> 16517.86s]  you're farming nominations over the end of the year
[16518.66s -> 16533.83s]  the bsaa confirmed it was so many bioterrorism attacks we just can't contain them all
[16537.90s -> 16543.02s]  it's nothing we can do umbrella is rated a plus by the better business bureau out of our hands
[16545.94s -> 16549.94s]  and right now you two are on the top of their list of suspects that sounded like a pokemon
[16553.69s -> 16575.37s]  no what pokemon sounds like that listen no it didn't what pokemon are you talking about
[16575.37s -> 16589.88s]  is this the end of his chapter we may have just beat this yeah oh look at all these accolades
[16591.83s -> 16598.98s]  s rank i got gold though you got silver now this is platinum mine has a crown my metal has a
[16599.54s -> 16607.45s]  royal crown on it and a wreath your your wreath is wilting mine is flexing you're getting outgamed
[16614.34s -> 16625.56s]  oh shit okay okay i can actually put a third skill in now we have 30 000 bucks i want to
[16625.56s -> 16632.76s]  know how bad that was i'm gonna watch the vlog later and say how bad it was i can't buy anything
[16636.54s -> 16641.42s]  how i had 8 000 left over from last time but well because you got kicked out remember
[16641.42s -> 16647.18s]  you hit like escape so you should have a lot of money right now i got 30k you should have like
[16647.18s -> 16660.34s]  20k at least no 13 there's a lot of single player only ones speeds up recovery time when dying what
[16660.34s -> 16667.14s]  does that even mean maybe i'll do firearm what's combat gauge is that a mechanic we should know
[16668.70s -> 16691.78s]  item drop thing i don't know not into i uh i'm good okay uh trying to i got 28 000 more points
[16692.42s -> 16701.37s]  i'm dropping items how many chapters are left um i would assume it's probably five or two in leon's
[16701.37s -> 16706.57s]  campaign or in the whole game in this campaign games oh i don't know there are two more for leon's
[16706.57s -> 16715.88s]  story okay i thought the daniel day lewis impression was good but i have not seen the movie
[16715.88s -> 16726.95s]  i've only seen one clip that's what my impression was based off of where's the thing i unlocked
[16726.95s -> 16742.25s]  what is happening uh what's wrong i'm trying to like there we go all right the ui is the problem
[16742.89s -> 16750.34s]  everything okay the item drop skills probably why you have so much more we got some item drop skill
[16750.98s -> 16758.79s]  users oh i had item drop on oh no because you you got to run that whole section
[16758.79s -> 16765.90s]  i yeah i did get like a big bridge with a lot of stuff you can hit escape anytime by the way
[16765.90s -> 16787.51s]  oh i thought i didn't know this plane is dead it's already dead on our way to china okay we're gonna
[16787.51s -> 16804.49s]  have a skydiving segment we might look how much space there is what are we have like a
[16806.26s -> 16811.13s]  passenger jet i don't know if somebody asked me if i'm an organ donor why is that why are you asking
[16812.09s -> 16818.18s]  what's your blood type i have no idea wouldn't stop Simmons do you know your blood type i actually
[16818.18s -> 16836.02s]  don't i have no idea no i actually don't know telling you find a boss zeus i'm very curious
[16836.02s -> 16846.68s]  what the boss will be on this campaign where's the emp in here no they turned into these things
[16847.24s -> 16858.44s]  we nuked it but what one of these things is in here yeah it's the dark souls uh you thought this
[16858.44s -> 16865.54s]  was a boss but now it's a normal elite enemy oh he's doing this on the plane oh my goodness
[16866.26s -> 16883.61s]  just open up the door back up throwing it back up just suck them out we can't go back any further
[16883.61s -> 16901.88s]  okay uh oh that's a new gun lightning hawk uh deagle that's actually pretty cool hey do you
[16901.88s -> 16907.27s]  know how to fly this thing there's something wrong with you're gonna go back to the tail of the plane
[16907.27s -> 16913.10s]  find out what's wrong it's the magnum nice i'm saving this to the last 10 seconds of the game
[16917.38s -> 16921.94s]  there's a lot of fairly calm people who are about to turn into zombies yeah
[16923.14s -> 16929.80s]  they're like already sitting yeah they're already they've been sitting calm down everyone relax
[16929.80s -> 16937.86s]  don't panic we're just two heavily armed civilians running through the plane looking for the zombie
[16938.58s -> 16943.59s]  it's just men in black music i mean there's a lot of people in suits with sunglasses so
[16944.23s -> 16965.70s]  might be onto something here i can't even hear it i'm going down how deep does this plane go i
[16965.70s -> 16980.06s]  i don't know here we go five grand do i have to help you i got it the big red valve nobody's
[16980.06s -> 16990.41s]  coming so hold on there's nobody flying the plane right now right correct this is kind of weird i
[16990.41s -> 16997.05s]  assume it's on autopilot but also there's a hole in the ceiling of the plane and uh hot steam
[16997.05s -> 17004.68s]  pouring out of some oddly placed i think we just have to be quick about it did you just shoot the
[17004.68s -> 17014.23s]  lap this is the part where wesker comes in and says uruburus i don't think the uruburus thing
[17014.23s -> 17017.99s]  was in this game was it i thought they got rid of that and it didn't they move to something else
[17017.99s -> 17024.38s]  like i just like saying it because the resident five and they're also in a plane like this one
[17024.38s -> 17030.23s]  when he says it he comes in through like the back i think we made it in time
[17033.83s -> 17040.65s]  oh god what if what if uh the monster in alien looked like that crawling
[17043.29s -> 17049.13s]  that would be kind of cool like 79 i don't even open the hatch we gotta get the gas out of here
[17050.17s -> 17057.83s]  it's just it's that's just a that's just a how do we open the hatch oh shit right here super soaker
[17058.55s -> 17062.70s]  all right protect me i gotta open this he's getting closer
[17063.66s -> 17086.17s]  oh i'm gonna try again all right let's dump him get dumped uh we're lighter than it he's gone
[17100.49s -> 17109.82s]  we would have wouldn't be flown off already holy shit see you later i was not ready for the space
[17109.82s -> 17115.96s]  r you've had more practice with that than me just curl up into a ball and hope for the best
[17118.71s -> 17122.39s]  hey anytime you wonder what happened to your luggage next time you take a flight just remember
[17122.39s -> 17127.51s]  this could be your passenger flight and you just don't know space plus r judge
[17128.82s -> 17144.78s]  dude you fucking fell off who's going through i almost got hit by that one i'm gonna win i'm
[17144.78s -> 17158.26s]  gonna win you just spread the virus that's true we just dumped that thing on top of the city
[17160.15s -> 17174.66s]  not my problem anymore oh okay elena we have to go i have zero shotgun left oh great everybody
[17175.62s -> 17195.10s]  everybody turned plane is infected yeah i'm just gonna i'm just running i okay i'm
[17196.28s -> 17204.84s]  guys i already used so much like of my don't ever make that joke again shit it's alex i need you to
[17204.84s -> 17212.65s]  say something for me uh-huh i want you to say that i say i and we injected and we ejected
[17213.45s -> 17218.09s]  ejected somebody that is like pretending to be somebody else what would you call that person
[17219.05s -> 17223.61s]  we ejected somebody that was trying to be somebody else like somebody that was
[17224.17s -> 17227.37s]  you know putting on like a costume to pretend to be somebody what would what would you call that
[17227.37s -> 17239.19s]  person um call that a really really badass halloween party no it's i can't shoot the gun
[17244.60s -> 17248.97s]  is it kind of like uh in the thing where there's like a crew of people but one of them
[17250.34s -> 17262.18s]  is not actually a person yeah i think we took too long this thing's going down man um so what do we
[17262.18s -> 17275.59s]  do hold on all right is it is it like when when they're being too noisy and you have to go
[17275.59s -> 17287.53s]  shush i have to you do something no okay i have to first switch off the autopilot to restore um
[17287.53s -> 17295.53s]  and where is that third button i didn't hear anything that she just said i think i started
[17295.53s -> 17306.41s]  a fire i said no i did that just pressing button try it again okay i think i got it
[17308.01s -> 17320.89s]  all right i am just hold the lever the people we ran past i guess are you steering this or is
[17320.89s -> 17334.15s]  it i'm flying the plane technically now what uh what are you talking about two different things
[17334.15s -> 17347.32s]  900 feet i'm doing it you're making the zombies fall down they like couldn't stand up oh we got
[17347.32s -> 17368.02s]  like this is rendered it's cinematic we should have taken the train like ada actually possibly
[17368.02s -> 17377.26s]  like tens of thousands dead and that would have they just kept them to up the ante first they
[17377.26s -> 17382.86s]  were crashing ambulances now we're crashing uh subways then trains then uh going straight
[17382.86s -> 17389.61s]  to like double decker planes what are we gonna crash next you can't keep one up on yourself
[17389.61s -> 17409.43s]  i see a ladder i wouldn't go we're gonna go there and get the item who's that that's no that's um
[17411.19s -> 17420.65s]  that's the president's daughter from the fourth game chief security advisor simmons why they're
[17420.65s -> 17426.97s]  so quiet there must be some sort of mistake i report to simmons it's wrong he's your supervisor

[17436.68s -> 17451.48s]  no you like oh me okay let me handle this what you thought is to avoid contact with anyone
[17452.36s -> 17459.22s]  leon's not just anyone he saved my life back in raccoon city okay it's it started with like
[17459.22s -> 17467.16s]  inflection and it just became like a like a regular reading oh look out evil three boss
[17467.88s -> 17492.79s]  i hope it hereditaries her you're a psycho it's an overwatch character the big monster

[18670.14s -> 18676.49s]  bit more of a reaction from that person doesn't know weaponized meat grinders it clearly worked
[18677.05s -> 18682.57s]  like why don't we just get like a transportable meat grinder to fight those zombies with
[18682.57s -> 18692.70s]  it ada just leave the door please just leave the door unlocked so we don't have to go around

[19991.77s -> 19996.81s]  thing to put in the game than to have it be like a slide if you press the button like who wants
[19996.81s -> 20011.06s]  the slide nobody wanted the slide the slide just causes problems what do we do when we get to this
[20011.06s -> 20017.22s]  end of the train all right he's on top he's gonna smash through i already pushed space see if you
[20017.22s -> 20026.02s]  can push space on the door um no i just i'd look like i could defeat mutated derrick i think oh
[20026.02s -> 20030.42s]  boy are all the characters in this game like brian oh wait wait come here come here eric
[20031.14s -> 20049.40s]  i i could just put you up why do they want me to push you up damage damage i'm doing damage

[20121.88s -> 20138.20s]  copied the villain from resident evil 6 i didn't see that i don't know what's happening uh
[20138.20s -> 20144.28s]  uh we're in the middle of i don't know what's going on i've teleported three times so i really
[20144.28s -> 20155.03s]  don't know he's on the other side of the train he's got bone shooting power we are playing
[20155.75s -> 20161.56s]  the jump cuts of a movie that's actually what's going on oh thank god okay i'm gonna hang on just

[20199.64s -> 20207.72s]  dude in space he's got a face god fucking damn it i hate this game i hate it so much i think i

[20273.88s -> 20285.13s]  i gotta get some i'm putting damage on him i just learned about this let's go all right i'm helping
[20285.13s -> 20290.92s]  okay he's gonna do the thing space r be ready here he comes okay i just shot you like six times
[20290.92s -> 20305.83s]  because you walked in front of me okay i thought he got you no i got that i picked up the smash
[20305.83s -> 20316.44s]  item all right he's up here other train all right wait there was no one on that train
[20322.10s -> 20333.37s]  it gave us control for a second um yeah what um did we win i don't i don't know i shot him with
[20333.37s -> 20341.46s]  a sniper rifle i shot him like two or three times with a sniper this is really this is the worst
[20341.46s -> 20346.82s]  boss fight of any resident evil game i think yeah but that's why it's kind of why i actually like it
[20347.54s -> 20351.30s]  we didn't even really get a chance to fight him like it was just kind of shoot him a little bit
[20351.30s -> 20356.63s]  and then there's a cutscene where we teleport around and he gets hit by a train i just love
[20356.63s -> 20362.63s]  how much time went into the like seven different cutscenes that are mostly uninteractable that lead
[20362.63s -> 20373.14s]  up to this point this is very bizarre there's actually more the world will be a better place
[20373.94s -> 20381.80s]  oh that's what it reminds me of the edge of tomorrow enemies except with more bones
[20383.00s -> 20389.24s]  yo that was sick good thing didn't even move yeah you shot the metal away from my face so i could
[20389.24s -> 20424.62s]  land between the eyes uh who's this there's no way we're on the tracks okay that's gotta be wesker
[20424.62s -> 20434.74s]  like who whoever suit guy is there they've put a bunch in the games when i said dude this game
[20434.74s -> 20449.10s]  sucks yeah yeah that does yeah would you even say you know well but i mean i i mean if you said
[20449.10s -> 20458.36s]  the game difference in this game sucks and game sucks there yeah there is a difference are we still
[20458.36s -> 20466.41s]  in the same chapter head for the mission objective we're absolutely at the finale coming up here
[20467.91s -> 20480.60s]  did we finish it we did what we could let's go excuse me excuse me the next chapter is the finale
[20481.16s -> 20490.36s]  i've got to complete the objective i've got to obtain the data remember just wants the game to
[20490.36s -> 20498.73s]  end yes do you though yeah all right well i better check to see if i have any fire bombs left
[20504.63s -> 20509.90s]  now we're gonna get one big giant finale in the last chapter but we haven't gotten the rocket
[20509.90s -> 20514.66s]  launcher yet that's how you know the game's almost over they give you a rocket launcher
[20514.66s -> 20519.94s]  with like three shots in it and they say end the game definitely infected people
[20519.94s -> 20528.65s]  who are just going to go to some safe house and mutate it's not it's not over the prologue
[20528.65s -> 20545.30s]  literally has an unfinished business here we go is it we gotta get the data what i tell you we
[20545.30s -> 20556.15s]  didn't get the data this is the key to stopping the sea virus it's jake is naked chris redfield
[20556.15s -> 20570.36s]  it's the chris redfield gift hey leave it alone ethan that's uh we're going to space
[20573.88s -> 20583.75s]  i don't yeah who is who is jake i've never heard of jake game is he from i don't think we have what
[20595.38s -> 20603.35s]  now the question is is this a traditional or is this a mutation bomb this is yeah this is a
[20603.35s -> 20623.34s]  infection where it makes everybody a zombie it's that same gas if i were a world superpower in
[20623.34s -> 20630.62s]  this universe i would invest a lot more in like air defense like anti-missile and he said why
[20630.62s -> 20637.85s]  don't they why don't they just make a big peepee virus i mean i don't know that's not i guess
[20637.85s -> 20653.26s]  that's i mean they you could just like turn the pills into a gas and then release that so are we
[20653.26s -> 20659.70s]  about to just kind of turn our backs on this and just be like well we tried oh shit's fucked oh
[20659.70s -> 20673.64s]  come on i thought i was gonna have 82 accuracy you haven't bought high deaths a new high score
[20673.64s -> 20679.86s]  yeah and how many of those deaths were you killing me intentionally we we need to remember that
[20679.86s -> 20684.02s]  that's important each chapter i have been killed deliberately by him at least two or three times
[20684.02s -> 20695.16s]  four at least two or three a chapter no no yeah chapter a chapter at least two or three now you're
[20695.16s -> 20704.68s]  ready to put this thing to bed uh i got 30 000 points not enough for crit two yeah i all right
[20704.68s -> 20708.20s]  can i can look at can i just make it like a uh actual rant about resident evil
[20709.16s -> 20713.08s]  unpopular opinion you have the floor i'm gonna before you say anything though i'm gonna say i do
[20713.08s -> 20719.16s]  not like condone or um agree with anything that he's about to say so but you have the floor okay
[20720.04s -> 20725.32s]  all right here we go i actually hate how in every resident evil they lock the super fun weapons
[20725.32s -> 20731.24s]  behind multi playthroughs just give me all the cool shit let me play i got a 60 game i kind of
[20731.32s -> 20736.04s]  don't want to play through three times just to unlock the in-game dlc just let me have all the
[20736.04s -> 20740.36s]  fun stuff scattered throughout the campaign so i can enjoy it and i'm fine paying that money for
[20740.36s -> 20749.56s]  a good experience and then i want to put it to bed i don't think that's that unpopular i feel like
[20749.56s -> 20753.56s]  the people who are like i want my extra value so i have reason to play through again and get like
[20753.56s -> 20763.72s]  quote unquote 60 dollars worth well i want this damn it i thought it was gonna be cheaper what the
[20764.36s -> 20770.12s]  3000 to 28 000 for level two get out of here that's what i mean like some of these are clearly
[20770.12s -> 20774.71s]  not going to be earnable in one campaign i thought i was gonna be able to do level two
[20774.71s -> 20781.30s]  twice whatever this one's 70k for the next one yeah i can't really afford anything i'm just gonna
[20781.30s -> 20785.86s]  i'm just gonna go playing this game with a friend is worth it yeah that's the only reason why i
[20785.86s -> 20790.81s]  play this there's no reason to play this unless you're playing with somebody else co-op makes
[20790.81s -> 20801.05s]  everything more fun that's the only reason why borderland still exists all right you're good to
[20801.05s -> 20811.64s]  go yep let's let's seal the deal on this thing i was burying the lead uh i just have a timer uh
[20811.64s -> 20818.55s]  yeah i hit escape first so what's going on here okay i think we both clicked at the same time
[20818.55s -> 20828.28s]  borderland solo can be fun i feel like you're just looking to shoot stuff and pick up items
[20828.28s -> 20840.73s]  it can be fun just to have in the background depends oh borderlands can be fun solo that's
[20840.73s -> 20846.33s]  someone that uh bought it with their friends they all got together to play one time and then none
[20846.33s -> 20849.69s]  of their friends were ever available to play a second time so they just kept playing because
[20849.69s -> 20857.77s]  no one else would and they're trying to feel good about their purchase i didn't say that i just want
[20857.77s -> 20863.96s]  to make sure everyone knows i'm the guy that did like the drink my milkshake horrible noise
[20863.96s -> 20868.44s]  everybody hated before that's not that was him that said that hate me for the other thing but not that

[21143.27s -> 21147.99s]  to be on camera yep you have to have lines you have to be able to see your face wearing helmets
[21147.99s -> 21156.70s]  are forbidden face coverings forbidden you gotta have full visual or your character can actually
[21156.70s -> 21168.23s]  die is your sensitivity insanely high right now uh it's pretty it's pretty high we can't risk
[21168.23s -> 21173.43s]  any more men in there and make sure you turn the air conditioner on to like recycle air
[21175.03s -> 21178.87s]  and put on some can you reach down the front put on some fucking spotify dude this is boring
[21178.87s -> 21185.53s]  like who drives around without music fucking weirdo i think you got the like silent uber
[21187.32s -> 21203.21s]  did you ask for like total silence i actually don't listen to music either i would listen to
[21203.21s -> 21207.93s]  music but i only have a cd player in my car i'm just gonna come out of the smoke all right
[21208.73s -> 21212.97s]  what was the last time you burned a cd
[21216.54s -> 21222.89s]  oh i don't remember i have no idea it's been a while i got defeat 500 zombies because this
[21222.89s -> 21242.78s]  dude ran one over that's funny okay so the fun fact we actually have to drive um across mainland
[21242.78s -> 21247.34s]  china this does all the way this does feel like a haunted hayride though we're just kind of slowly
[21247.34s -> 21252.92s]  driving by all the actors this is as far as i can get you why the smoke clear is right up ahead
[21252.92s -> 21258.60s]  you two keep going i'm gonna head back and try to find what's left of my team yeah we could have
[21258.60s -> 21265.34s]  gone faster if we just ran yeah but we can't breathe we could have held our breath and sprinted
[21265.34s -> 21270.78s]  and gotten there faster what if it's like skin reactive it's not it's when you breathe it in
[21271.58s -> 21294.79s]  all right going up good thing zombies can't climb sometimes they can that guy's dead why
[21294.79s -> 21301.94s]  didn't he just come with us yeah that's weird the gas is still going still having to run out of
[21301.94s -> 21310.73s]  vehicles you know on a kill it's the same you can't that there's other miles per hour you can go
[21310.73s -> 21315.21s]  that are not 100 or zero people need to tell the resident evil people just you don't have to push
[21315.21s -> 21320.49s]  down all the way on the gas it's not we're not playing like cruising usa commentary too
[21321.37s -> 21325.13s]  they're driving like they're in an arcade it goes from like you're going five miles an hour
[21325.13s -> 21331.27s]  in a humvee too watch out there's a gas tanker coming right at you and it's gonna explode
[21334.57s -> 21338.81s]  yeah the mill the guy that guy was going five miles per hour he's going like zero
[21339.53s -> 21351.59s]  you only go zero or a hundred in resident evil oh okay this is the prologue i played this part
[21351.59s -> 21362.28s]  what there's a callback the prologue of the game starts here and uh helena's wounded so how do we
[21362.28s -> 21368.46s]  do this leon it's maybe i'm not wounded yet but i'm gonna be wounded so watch out wait are we
[21368.46s -> 21374.62s]  about to like fight dr robotnik is that what this ending is no no no like i get wounded somehow and
[21374.62s -> 21386.89s]  you have to carry me and then uh returning enemy shows back up at the end this way leon leon do
[21386.89s -> 21400.12s]  you hear me are you all right am i talking to you uh maybe wait i we've changed we've changed
[21400.12s -> 21410.55s]  history at the beginning of the game leon carries helena through this part oh okay we've
[21410.55s -> 21422.82s]  found destinations all right we got something in here i've got that all right over here why did i
[21422.82s -> 21432.73s]  do that why did i just check pulse he dead that was really easy oh dinner plate but at the beginning
[21432.73s -> 21440.97s]  of the game you only have like three bullets you wouldn't understand i did the tutorial too
[21454.14s -> 21460.58s]  log doesn't have any continuity at all why do i need toggling aimed on sites um it's more
[21460.58s -> 21476.26s]  comfortable for me i just like it better action express magnum ammo why can i pick that up
[21479.51s -> 21485.78s]  i can't pick that up hold on my inventory is beautiful you have to like delete something
[21485.78s -> 21495.30s]  you end up picking up hundreds of pistol bullets over the course of the game okay got it do you
[21495.30s -> 21498.58s]  ever randomly get nervous about being like an extra on a movie set and they're doing some kind
[21498.58s -> 21502.90s]  of like you know being one of the zombies and the main characters are spraying bullets
[21502.90s -> 21506.90s]  and then all the zombies have to dive at the same time to pretend to be dead and you're the one that
[21506.90s -> 21513.83s]  like is off oh like jump to the ground first yeah like last before everybody else does well the thing
[21513.83s -> 21519.03s]  the director is sitting behind that's saying like okay down down down down down they cut the director
[21519.03s -> 21524.47s]  out he's got like his own they usually edit mount would you be one of the people that like dives to
[21524.47s -> 21528.63s]  the ground like falls backward or does like the shoulder shimmy where you do left shoulder right
[21528.63s -> 21534.50s]  shoulder left shoulder right like you got hit peppered like six times why can i oh well i would
[21534.50s -> 21538.87s]  have direction because the director would be talking but they were just like you know feeling
[21538.87s -> 21545.46s]  your vibe and they're just letting you pick the vibe all right guys just want you to feel the
[21545.46s -> 21549.51s]  vibe and just do whatever you want well then the movie would never get made they'd have to take
[21549.51s -> 21555.78s]  a hundred takes yeah but that's how it's gonna go when the zoomers finally start making movies
[21555.78s -> 21578.28s]  where are we now just do whatever your vibe is um i'm trying just to okay yep spoiler alert
[21578.28s -> 21587.40s]  there's a helicopter and this oh yeah i remember this why can i move
[21589.96s -> 21595.32s]  that's more realistic all right that's how it would probably actually happen okay was i supposed
[21595.32s -> 21599.40s]  to hold w or d because i was holding i don't know i was holding i'm sorry s right walk towards the
[21599.40s -> 21605.24s]  camera that's what i was doing but i don't know maybe it's w because it's a w it might be w i
[21605.24s -> 21612.55s]  don't know i get was i running looked like you were running i was holding s let me try it again
[21613.72s -> 21626.31s]  you're holding s like before after monka always after okay i'm holding s holding s
[21629.75s -> 21636.23s]  this is easier with a controller like i don't get it it's s yeah but you they he stops and
[21636.23s -> 21642.28s]  he just starts walking you have to hold space this is this is actually the sprint tutorial like
[21642.28s -> 21649.27s]  in the beginning of the game oh shit it's because my i'm still toggled on for my aim
[21650.39s -> 21654.39s]  you're still aiming down sights i'm character the character is still aiming because i have a script
[21657.34s -> 21669.10s]  right okay well it should be off now yeah we're good all right everybody reset take four this
[21669.10s -> 21674.46s]  stunt has cost us 18 million dollars oh way more than that this is like a 10 billion dollar stuff
[21675.26s -> 21699.86s]  you're just like flickering onto my screen that was like hey the zombie just standing there yeah
[21699.86s -> 21705.22s]  why was that guy shooting you're shooting at the cars i thought that was in the game for a second
[21705.22s -> 21715.61s]  i was like that was loud and it was weird all right you've trained how to fly a plane how about
[21715.61s -> 21734.95s]  a helicopter you got a chemistry final tomorrow well good luck i'm getting dizzy yeah i was gonna
[21734.95s -> 21745.93s]  like laugh out loud not do it but i want to get out of this it's making me sick all right i'm
[21745.93s -> 21750.25s]  gonna catch this guy and when i catch him i really he's a zombie and then oh no it's a zombie and
[21750.25s -> 21765.19s]  then i have to let him go oh that's right i'm good thank you i missed so don't worry i missed
[21765.19s -> 21790.50s]  again focus on flying i got it you're doing great all right you know okay are you like not you're
[21790.50s -> 21797.10s]  just not entertained at all right now right like me i i am but for the wrong reasons i say when
[21797.10s -> 21800.94s]  you do too much of this shit like i'm i'm not entertained anymore i'm just kind of like
[21801.90s -> 21807.59s]  i want you to breathe i want i want this game to remember this is like concurrent with uh the
[21807.59s -> 21815.98s]  uncharted games coming up so it was kind of like hot you know like the super detailed elaborate
[21816.70s -> 21830.50s]  action set pieces yeah that's that's fine but i want the game to breathe i wanted to fail that
[21830.50s -> 21837.19s]  but also i didn't know if it was going to do the whole chopper scene again or not yeah that would
[21837.19s -> 21847.99s]  have been painful that's very good call uh we got a lot of boxes here oh i think it's important this
[21847.99s -> 21856.23s]  is probably the final boxes of the game i don't have any space yeah neither do i um i don't want
[21856.23s -> 21877.72s]  this anymore did you do that yeah i want to combine these yeah you got 12 healings make sure your guns
[21877.72s -> 21884.70s]  are live whatever you know what i mean just make sure your guns work uh-huh there's a plate too
[21884.70s -> 21894.02s]  do you like upgrading guns sometimes would that make this would that be like a good feature in
[21894.02s -> 21909.93s]  this game oh yeah that that is missing that you upgrade your character in a weird way right okay
[21909.93s -> 21916.23s]  so we're about to find out who it is because he's like you're back all right if wesker comes walks
[21916.23s -> 21923.21s]  around that pillar i'll give you 50 bucks all right i i bet it's either wesker or the unkillable guy
[21923.21s -> 21938.30s]  we dropped the metal thing on there's a lot of explosives in that truck bed why do we care about
[21938.30s -> 21946.84s]  that guy like we've walked over a thousand corpses it's not wesker is it just the suited
[21946.84s -> 21957.59s]  war villain it is from the train yeah well it's uh oh eight is gonna throw us the rocket launcher
[21957.59s -> 21979.10s]  like she does in every game right looks like jake gillenhall and william defoe
[21982.20s -> 21993.16s]  that's cool i just said that's cool oh that's cool i was reading chat i'm sorry
[22000.54s -> 22006.79s]  okay here we go let's defeat derrick just explode this it's right next to him
[22009.32s -> 22019.35s]  big red tanker does not explode okay is this a dinosaur holy shit literally a t-rex this is
[22019.35s -> 22026.07s]  the coolest part of the whole game this is awesome wow with the helicopters
[22028.39s -> 22032.71s]  oh you're gonna shoot him in the eye he's got an eye in front of his mouth oh yeah i played horizon
[22033.59s -> 22047.34s]  oh now we get on we get down we start stepping on his head get him you're closer
[22047.34s -> 22058.78s]  melee him go melee him yeah yeah derrick all right unload that'll teach you to jump the turn
[22058.86s -> 22075.96s]  style at the subway station derrick oh i gotta get the fuck away from him i can't his boxes
[22075.96s -> 22094.42s]  are on the edges too i got an explosion another car is 100 miles an hour oh yeah pet the dog
[22104.39s -> 22116.90s]  all right get it it's a turret section i stopped working yes i think it overheated
[22117.86s -> 22134.98s]  okay this whole game sucked until this last 30 seconds did we not do it yeah we did it he's got
[22134.98s -> 22145.03s]  eyes in his chest too whoever's driving this thing deserves a deserves some applause they're
[22145.03s -> 22148.39s]  working with very limited space and they're honestly doing a pretty great job
[22149.99s -> 22155.19s]  can they stop doing cutscenes well that guy died he was in the driver's seat when it fell
[22156.07s -> 22162.39s]  oh we did we got like running at like 120 fps and like the game's like shit's happening too fast
[22162.39s -> 22172.71s]  or something all right he's going back into his uh into his form you want to get this one yeah i
[22172.71s -> 22204.60s]  got i got this one get it get him i'm trying get off you fucking dumbass can i get that use that
[22204.60s -> 22221.10s]  machine gun oh i think i just blew up a can by you i'm okay i'll get this one that's strike four
[22221.10s -> 22227.38s]  by the way i just want to make sure you're aware i haven't i haven't done anything yet see what you
[22227.38s -> 22230.10s]  don't know is once you get up he's going to transform then you're going to move out of the
[22230.10s -> 22236.18s]  way and then i'm going to blow it see all right now now move away what not yet wait wait wait he's
[22236.18s -> 22246.31s]  probably invulnerable now okay he screamed and i can't do it there we go i didn't like didn't
[22246.31s -> 22266.78s]  affect him at all i'm gonna come down there wait is there any magnum bullets come on we get the
[22267.58s -> 22274.47s]  and shoot the mini bird he's going down right in his face okay now we're gonna have to like
[22274.47s -> 22293.66s]  mag dump hey to relax all this will she won't she tension well this is we shoot it from the
[22300.07s -> 22317.61s]  we're not done what's wrong there's nothing let's go but that was not the last boss it just keeps
[22317.61s -> 22327.72s]  going you guys have to carve him you only have 60 seconds carve him but like a yeah like monster
[22327.72s -> 22332.36s]  hunter well the thing is that would have been actually really funny if we had done that boss
[22332.36s -> 22340.68s]  for 45 straight minutes she's more than just and we did it without cats yeah feelings for her and
[22340.68s -> 22350.25s]  then we uh retried it like five times it's only 45 minutes if you suck ass yeah i didn't say the
[22350.33s -> 22355.48s]  quality of our gameplay i just said hold on it's probably a qt
[22368.66s -> 22378.07s]  um i just took your place you have to climb first so we have to do this together
[22378.07s -> 22391.58s]  okay um i feel like i'm going too slow
[22395.02s -> 22404.17s]  i'm afraid i didn't want to overtake you uh-huh he's moving over there who else is up there ada
[22404.17s -> 22408.89s]  uh it's ada oh that's probably like the ada boss fight oh wait don't you kind of want to
[22408.89s -> 22414.70s]  see what happens i think they probably are both in god mode are they in god mode do you think
[22421.96s -> 22426.76s]  this is she's why she'd knock off spider-man in this game i don't know but i think she
[22426.76s -> 22444.66s]  wait she's probably gonna die um we have sniper rifle ammo oh now she gets to beat him up we
[22444.66s -> 22455.96s]  cannot reliably do anything from back here how i can't even we just did you have any sniper
[22455.96s -> 22462.90s]  rifle ammo yeah but i have nothing do we even have to shoot it what is it what's the objective
[22462.90s -> 22480.17s]  it just protect ada did it reach ada can you come fight over here ada just grapple literally
[22480.17s -> 22496.50s]  just grapple away okay she finally is doing the beat down uh she she has to do it three times too
[22502.20s -> 22511.16s]  oh the zombie that comes to our side is so we can they're like delivering ammo who designed
[22511.16s -> 22522.07s]  this segment but let's go like hurry up zero or 100 we have to climb again
[22526.15s -> 22532.68s]  i can't relax well i thought i i had whatever all right hang on hang on
[22532.68s -> 22540.28s]  just get two or three in front of me one two one two get in front of me why i there was no
[22540.28s -> 22546.63s]  prompt that was just you have to catch me i think i just have to get you okay go ahead one two one
[22546.63s -> 22558.06s]  two one two one all right i'm moving i think you have enough space am i too close oh shit
[22559.24s -> 22567.62s]  shoot him now uh i had this space in our hair be careful have you seen videos of like bears
[22567.62s -> 22572.90s]  climbing trees okay they can do they can do some crazy shit that's what this reminds me of
[22589.43s -> 22592.87s]  it's like they sampled clips of random orchestrated music from a hundred different
[22592.87s -> 22601.29s]  games and movies and just slapped them all together it's like it's like every marvel movie
[22601.29s -> 22608.81s]  every horror movie are you down there go punch him in the face all right i'm gonna i'm i can't move
[22609.77s -> 22618.90s]  i actually can't do anything hey where are you i'm like up here giving support i guess
[22620.02s -> 22627.86s]  ada you maybe waste every single magnum shot i don't you next you gotta be next to ada and then
[22627.86s -> 22635.61s]  do the revive movie revive i was making that up i don't know this is a waste of goddamn time
[22635.61s -> 22642.95s]  what the fuck am i doing is this what it feels like to be like a regular marine in a godzilla
[22642.95s -> 22651.14s]  movie all right i hopefully we can get you back here are you across no i'm like up in the tower
[22651.14s -> 22664.06s]  up here this is dangerous but i need that ammo he just changed he was not that he did not look
[22664.06s -> 22673.61s]  like that a second ago i'll tell you i'm just gonna use those should it be shoot him in the head
[22673.61s -> 22690.34s]  or where i'm shooting him in the ass he do got some big cheeks like big bulbous oh god damn it man
[22699.24s -> 22706.70s]  i haven't had a loaded gun in 30 to 40 straight seconds i'm doing my am i supposed to do something
[22706.70s -> 22711.10s]  up here i think we just have to do this wait oh there's a whole level up here why have the
[22711.10s -> 22716.30s]  zombies not even been attacking me defeat mutants dare all right good luck down
[22717.50s -> 22726.49s]  oh who the fuck is i thought there's just a random citizen up here
[22727.37s -> 22745.05s]  innocent oh it's my opportunity get up i'm showing body shots because i don't know where to shoot
[22745.05s -> 22752.10s]  them from down here dude having the dodge roll will you stay on the ground i'm not so sure if
[22752.10s -> 22762.39s]  that's a good idea get the fuck up all right come on is this zombie even host okay
[22762.95s -> 22769.91s]  come on you can do that the whole time knock him down what the fuck primary mechanic in the game
[22781.45s -> 22789.69s]  okay please i get us out of here you having fun down there no i zero to do something what
[22789.69s -> 22819.46s]  am i supposed to do i'm gonna fucking die did we finally do it it's in the window okay um
[22823.70s -> 22825.70s]  you had to get into the cutscene spawn
[22830.62s -> 22842.79s]  he only fell from like 100 feet it was locked until you got to zero health is that really what
[22842.79s -> 22854.28s]  that was i was so far away from all that that i had no effect on that fight
[22857.46s -> 22861.38s]  the t-rex brought this a full letter grade up but the rest of this brought it three letter grades
[22861.38s -> 22890.74s]  down i wish i could stay longer shooter we're sticking together oh leon how sweet how much
[22890.74s -> 22898.14s]  more it was there to do i feel like we've killed the same boss three times like we keep killing
[22898.14s -> 22905.67s]  these two guys guy on all fours in the t-rex yeah she texted you so you would have her number
[22905.67s -> 22922.01s]  that's right yes we see the helicopter that means the end is in sight let's just pretend
[22922.01s -> 22930.22s]  to be a zombie just walking dead all right here we go this is the puppet master zombie
[22930.22s -> 22948.86s]  this is the lady what's her name that's the it's this guy again that's it's the guy yep
[22958.52s -> 22962.28s]  are you gonna do the other playthroughs this is the whole premise of resident evil 2 though
[22962.92s -> 22969.38s]  and leon's wait no uh we're gonna do the other playthroughs no i'm going to burn the copy of my
[22969.38s -> 22980.71s]  cd i have no health i'm like dead hold on can i heal you let's do something about it
[22980.71s -> 22988.42s]  hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i got it i'm good nice what do we have to shoot here i think
[22988.42s -> 23005.59s]  it's just him i think he goes pretty good now he's gonna what this ex-zombie saved us this time
[23006.39s -> 23009.67s]  well there's the now he comes back again we have to be in the helicopter for him to spawn though
[23016.39s -> 23022.07s]  yeah we're gonna get in the helicopter he's gonna jump at us or like learn to fly even yep he's
[23022.07s -> 23027.74s]  gonna jump up he's gonna grab the helicopter with a tendril and then we are gonna have to shoot him
[23027.74s -> 23032.73s]  with the rocket launcher it's a good time to reload every gun yes that's what i am doing that
[23032.73s -> 23064.54s]  right now you guys should play the jake campaign i'd rather eat a ghost pepper oh more stuff that
[23064.54s -> 23069.10s]  was actually like five deagle rounds i feel like we should have had more opportunity to
[23069.10s -> 23083.91s]  upgrade our character or something not between chapters that's meh lame co-op moment eating a
[23083.91s -> 23092.60s]  ghost pepper not clickbait he turned into a fly did you see that hold on we got one more like
[23092.60s -> 23118.62s]  separated get me out of here i'm just like shooting at this guy climb down this is
[23118.62s -> 23129.93s]  what's up are you fighting the guy i'm just shooting this big fly in the face i think i'm
[23129.93s -> 23147.85s]  winning oh hold on did i do something you you moved it like i'm i'm far enough away from king
[23147.85s -> 23155.32s]  kong this is not scary i'm far enough away from him now like i'm not i'm not in any danger he's
[23155.32s -> 23161.32s]  one of the like haunted house uh workers like he can't touch he's always moving
[23161.32s -> 23173.53s]  what is happening oh i he's gotten angry oh i have to move this again i'm out of ammo and a lot of
[23173.53s -> 23189.46s]  weapons i have no bullets all right just hang in there i'll be with you do i have any bullets in
[23189.46s -> 23197.40s]  any gun no i have nothing i don't i can i have nothing i have no i don't know what i'm doing
[23197.40s -> 23214.95s]  i'm playing like a game show over here i don't think it matters he can't hurt me are you dead
[23215.67s -> 23225.13s]  uh i guess so i feel like okay something was wrong there something was wrong there i
[23225.69s -> 23233.05s]  used every weapon i think can you move me faster probably me but i could i could be a little faster
[23233.05s -> 23236.89s]  this time yeah i didn't know exactly what it's supposed to do first because you were just like
[23236.89s -> 23242.57s]  the giant flies over there except reunite with your partner he's very vague i used every bullet i had
[23243.37s -> 23253.94s]  i'm not even gonna shoot at him what a waste i could definitely jump to you
[23256.23s -> 23268.12s]  just kind of like a pog he's like okay so i'm not gonna do anything all right there's like four
[23268.12s -> 23276.58s]  zombies i gotta kill the zombies move them over somewhere all right you're moving i'm moving you
[23278.42s -> 23289.98s]  okay this is where he jumps now over that was pretty good shot i can't activate it again yet
[23290.78s -> 23301.37s]  all right here he comes he's coming over to the uh lift thing there he is all right now i can do
[23301.37s -> 23320.68s]  it again working on it oh shit hold on you have to be out of the way i got at least 10 seconds okay
[23320.68s -> 23334.20s]  got it okay are you moving me yeah am i moving i gotta it has to reset there's like a timer
[23336.62s -> 23348.36s]  okay i i'm out of bullets again looks like he's can i leave already yet i don't know what
[23349.24s -> 23368.79s]  oh shit okay all right you're all clear oh there's a lot of shit up here yeah okay so i've
[23368.79s -> 23374.65s]  been pushing buttons on this little device okay so now we where do we go to go through this
[23383.03s -> 23395.85s]  okay flies are so fucking ugly i hope they all die who somebody said that they think flies are
[23395.85s -> 23403.59s]  ugly and they should all die i'd be okay with that don't flies actually do something very
[23403.59s -> 23408.55s]  important like decomposition and stuff i'm sure the whole ecosystem does but like that assumes
[23408.55s -> 23415.19s]  that i'm willing to spare the ecosystem you've gotten to a bigger fly and i would rather delete
[23415.19s -> 23421.35s]  all like ants flies and wasps we're not going anywhere in that chopper all right so
[23421.35s -> 23432.36s]  so time to fight where should we shoot him with the legs
[23434.04s -> 23442.98s]  dude his arms yeah i don't know his legs his belly he's protecting his eyes so we have to make him
[23442.98s -> 23457.30s]  unheated and then shoot him in the eyes when possible all right what else is left to shoot
[23458.02s -> 23461.83s]  he just peekabooed i shot it
[23461.83s -> 23463.11s]  he just peeked yeah
[23464.95s -> 23477.37s]  what okay he zeus he's got zeus thank you you were right the lightning rod
[23484.54s -> 23493.58s]  in the head sniper bullets in there all right i'm gonna take out the ads yeah we need we need ammo
[23502.81s -> 23509.70s]  well he absorbs one zombie and oh my god there's some ammo back here yeah this crates
[23510.58s -> 23522.33s]  this is not the time for points i want bullets oh shit wait we can touch this
[23522.97s -> 23529.80s]  what okay i just stabbed this guy oh he has to eat it we're trying to make him eat the lightning
[23529.80s -> 23537.37s]  bolt so he gets electrocuted um so this guy's stabbed how do we move this guy now can i move
[23537.37s -> 23542.65s]  him can i kick him we just have to keep doing damage to his like body do the do the yellow
[23542.65s -> 23551.22s]  orbs and then shoot him in the face when he falls down we're shooting his legs off or something
[23551.22s -> 23565.66s]  need ammo okay here he goes this guy's been lightning defied now what shoot him in the eyes
[23568.58s -> 23588.02s]  all right then what about it send it how he's gonna grab it how zeus activate the power
[23607.53s -> 23613.77s]  my god it's still going like that callback actually is potentially what took down the
[23613.77s -> 23624.28s]  final boss it just won't it won't stop okay there's so much content in this game think
[23624.28s -> 23631.51s]  about how many like 20 minute youtube videos i could have made no all right here we are
[23632.23s -> 23643.22s]  we made it oh oh there it is oh there it is the bazooka the rpg
[23647.61s -> 23653.16s]  this better be a good explosion we both take the shot or do i fly into you shoot i wonder
[23653.88s -> 23673.80s]  you got up we both got i just i shot him that fall over there's a guy in a costume
[23675.10s -> 23686.14s]  one rpg that was not what i thought all right i thought we were gonna like fly the chopper and
[23686.86s -> 23700.92s]  yeah yeah i love this scene in simon so i'm ality that's not zombie movie the other one
[23700.92s -> 23706.62s]  hot fuzz it's probably not over like you said he's gonna grab the helicopter we're gonna have
[23706.62s -> 23719.69s]  to do something else yes but that one was made of dragon glass okay that's gonna make the umbrella
[23719.69s -> 23729.72s]  simple isn't it lightning couldn't kill him but an rpg could that exactly what they wanted to have
[23729.72s -> 23739.32s]  happen the plan is all in place only with the blood of the ancient one i guess not ancient he
[23739.32s -> 23754.25s]  was like born in like 1975 or something he said let's get to the chopper all right you still have
[23754.25s -> 23762.34s]  a shot let's get out of here it's because i didn't i didn't even get to shoot the final boss with
[23762.34s -> 23772.97s]  the rpg i had to do i had to do something it's gonna put us all the way back isn't it i think
[23772.97s -> 23785.99s]  you just fucked us i think you just fucked us over we have to watch that again all right at the same
[23785.99s -> 23795.21s]  time now at the same time now i think we can skip cutscenes oh shit can you escape i can't i'm in
[23795.77s -> 23800.73s]  oh my god dude we were out of it we were done just time it at the same time three two one shoot it
[23803.29s -> 23811.50s]  okay no no we both do it at the same time pick it up are you ready get in the spot one two three
[23812.30s -> 23822.95s]  okay good now escape we can skip this all right we're good let's go don't you i know you shot
[23822.95s -> 23834.62s]  yours so yep i shot mine this time it actually remembers that may have been my only chance to
[23834.62s -> 23850.17s]  shoot the rpg in the whole game it probably was oh i thought this was a smoke detector the data
[23851.54s -> 23860.54s]  you have to get the data intel the reports we're gonna break this case wide open we already know
[23860.54s -> 23864.78s]  what happened now we can make it public we already know what happened we have to clear leon's name
[23864.78s -> 23869.26s]  because everyone thinks that you killed the president exactly oh shit that's right you're
[23869.26s -> 23882.79s]  right you got it oh that's it all right i have a new i have a new game for us to play
[23883.99s -> 23892.62s]  okay uh let's go after this is over who can uninstall this game faster oh sorry uh this is
[23892.62s -> 23897.98s]  going to be the new yearly halloween co-op we got three more years because there's three more
[23897.98s -> 23904.25s]  campaigns i'm playing this ever again all right how about this you play and i'll like eat a ghost
[23904.25s -> 23911.16s]  pepper on your screen and i'll just leave who said that this one's even over what if it what
[23911.16s -> 23922.57s]  if he comes back all right well the shit all this shit talking it actually was it wasn't that bad
[23922.57s -> 23931.16s]  it was bad but it wasn't it was awful but it wasn't like awful enough to not play let's be
[23931.16s -> 23935.72s]  honest it was not good but it was not if you have a friend you can just laugh through it like we
[23935.72s -> 23964.54s]  just did all right stay for the after credit scene player has left the game uninstalled i win got it
[23964.54s -> 23970.28s]  nice i'm honestly shocked that it didn't like yank me back to the did you force quit it because
[23970.28s -> 23978.25s]  i can't even hit escape on this menu i i just literally all tabbed and just force quit it wow
[23978.25s -> 23986.46s]  okay the game's now uninstalled wow all right nice okay how much of that is related to me like
[23986.46s -> 23992.25s]  the throwing a bomb on you and how much of it is just the game well i did we had a i just figured
[23992.25s -> 24001.67s]  that it would be like a funny thing to who can uninstall it faster okay now delete the banana
[24001.67s -> 24006.95s]  gif i didn't make i didn't do upload it i've watched it and laughed at it i still have a
[24006.95s -> 24020.92s]  google image for chris redfield with a banana open i don't want to see it all right that's it
[24020.92s -> 24028.84s]  that was fun that was resident evil 6 and it was a fun game and we played it was fun yeah show
[24028.84s -> 24036.17s]  and we're going to play the next three chapters on a stream near you everyone just didn't want
[24036.17s -> 24041.13s]  to see his final score probably true oh wait did you see it did you get that actually no i i quit
[24041.13s -> 24051.13s]  too i didn't want to be left behind uh how long we've been how long has the stream been
[24051.13s -> 24057.21s]  uh six hours and 40 minutes probably like an hour of that was just the one outside the house
[24057.21s -> 24063.61s]  segment i forgot that we started at 330 in my brain this started at two but no we started
[24063.61s -> 24070.82s]  at 330 pretty cool well i hope you guys enjoyed that hope it was fun i actually had a great time
[24070.82s -> 24076.41s]  like regardless of the game was bad it was fun to do that is that supposed to be the best campaign
[24076.89s -> 24081.69s]  is that the best one in the game that's the main campaign from what i understand because look you
[24081.69s -> 24086.94s]  saw like ada i you're gonna oh ada's across the bridge she's fighting the monster you do
[24086.94s -> 24094.52s]  i think you just do their version yeah because you yeah you see them that's them in a boss fight
[24094.52s -> 24099.16s]  like later when you play that campaign and i'm sure you'll turn around as ada you'll look over
[24099.16s -> 24103.56s]  your shoulder you'll turn you'll see oh there they are there's the other two players there's leon and
[24103.56s -> 24114.34s]  yeah there was a good story moment wait you said the game was bad and you lost 500 viewers what
[24114.34s -> 24121.99s]  are you talking no i did not say that oh you're talking about right now no um people are leaving
[24121.99s -> 24127.91s]  because the stream is ending yeah yeah there's not gonna be another six and a half hour campaign
[24127.91s -> 24137.32s]  right now it's over i thought okay i thought you see you mean all right well that's uh i think
[24137.32s -> 24143.98s]  that's gonna be it thanks italics for playing it's always a pleasure it was very fun we'll uh
[24143.98s -> 24153.59s]  we'll see you soon i will indeed thank you the germamites yep for having me uh you know where
[24153.59s -> 24158.39s]  to find italics if you don't i hope you're keeping an active tally of all my plus twos

[24165.62s -> 24180.65s]  thanks everybody bye take care so where does that leave us the plan here is on wednesday
[24182.30s -> 24189.59s]  the monster rancher they're not remakes and they're not remasters so i'm not going to call them that
[24189.59s -> 24197.61s]  they're reports they're ports i'm gonna play at least monster rancher 2 i'm trying to think
[24197.61s -> 24201.51s]  if i should do them both but i don't think so i think we're just gonna do two because two is the
[24201.51s -> 24215.74s]  best one so we'll play monster rancher 2 get back into it and then on thursday is the game awards
[24215.74s -> 24219.26s]  so i'm gonna stream the game awards and depending how long the game awards is we'll probably just
[24219.26s -> 24231.88s]  go back to monster rancher 2 again and then from there that will be thursday after that i really
[24231.88s -> 24238.30s]  want to get the the baby sensory you laugh you lose kind of just chatting stream ready so that'll
[24238.30s -> 24245.66s]  probably be somewhere early in the next week i can't believe you're doing i mean i'm gonna
[24245.66s -> 24257.99s]  i'm gonna do it so this is a chill week um i don't think so maybe the monster rancher streams will be
[24258.55s -> 24262.39s]  lower energy i'm not we'll see i say that but it always ends up being the opposite
[24262.39s -> 24271.96s]  but hope you had a good time thanks for watching everybody we are out i'll see you guys on wednesday
[24271.96s -> 24280.68s]  for monster rancher you have never seen monster rancher it is it's very good it's there's a lot
