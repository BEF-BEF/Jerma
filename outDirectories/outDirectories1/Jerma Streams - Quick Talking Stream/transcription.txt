[9.72s -> 17.60s]  Hi. Welcome. Good to see you.
[17.60s -> 34.90s]  Come on, I've got my Las Vegas hat on. I'm so drunk right now, you have no idea.
[34.90s -> 40.34s]  Hi everybody. Welcome to the stream. This is gonna be a very short stream.
[40.34s -> 50.58s]  Tiny. Like this big. Small. Delay Andy. That's me.
[50.58s -> 60.64s]  It's gonna be a very compact one. I look so tired. I'm not used to waking up this early.
[60.64s -> 70.07s]  You look young. I do?
[70.07s -> 77.98s]  Wait, is it the hat? I know why. It's because I used to wear hats. Like this. All the time.
[77.98s -> 83.86s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. So now I look old again, right? Do I look old?
[83.86s -> 88.70s]  Shit. Alright, so let's put the hat back on and see what happens.
[88.70s -> 98.09s]  Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Okay.
[98.09s -> 105.19s]  Wait. I can look even younger. Ready? Watch this. That's the trick.
[105.19s -> 110.82s]  You want to look younger? Just have your hat pointing up at the ceiling and have it rest on your head.
[110.82s -> 113.89s]  Now let's look older. Ready?
[113.89s -> 121.22s]  Hey. Hey, Sport. Oh, hey, Sport. How you doing?
[121.22s -> 126.18s]  Oh, hey. Yeah, I'm doing good. School's good.
[126.18s -> 129.67s]  School's doing good? That's good to know.
[129.67s -> 133.91s]  Hey, I got you a gift card to Target for this year.
[133.91s -> 138.43s]  A gift card to Target? Cool. Thanks, Uncle.
[138.43s -> 143.61s]  Yeah, of course. Of course. You can come visit Uncle anytime. Anytime you want, come to Uncle's.
[143.61s -> 146.42s]  I'll just fix it for you.
[146.42s -> 157.13s]  Redneck? No, that's, I mean, that's earnest. Yeah, this is earnest.
[157.13s -> 162.07s]  If you pull your hat way down on, like, your eyebrows, then you're just earnest.
[162.07s -> 167.55s]  And you know what I mean, Burn? Oh, no. Look at, no.
[167.55s -> 173.75s]  No, you can, you can, okay, you can see my crow's feet. You can see my cyberpunk augmentation.
[173.75s -> 182.80s]  Hold on. No. You can see my, like, cybernetics.
[182.80s -> 196.27s]  Oh, well. Anyways, there's a dog on the floor.
[196.27s -> 205.70s]  You know what's really funny about this dog? He, that's a nice dog bed. It really is.
[205.70s -> 212.01s]  But he doesn't give a shit. He's like, I don't care. What's on your face?
[212.01s -> 221.79s]  What is it? What is like this? What is this?
[221.79s -> 224.22s]  By the way, look at his outfit.
[224.22s -> 228.22s]  I've lost complete control at this point. You know what I mean?
[228.22s -> 231.22s]  Look at the hat. I've got, like, Dr. Favorite. I've got, like, pajamas on.
[231.22s -> 233.22s]  I've got, like, pajama pants.
[233.22s -> 239.96s]  I really am like a fucking 45-year-old.
[239.96s -> 248.06s]  That's how I dress. This is how I dress. People think I'm, hold on.
[248.06s -> 251.06s]  Come on. I've got to get away from earnest. We've got to go more, there we go.
[251.06s -> 256.38s]  There we go. Okay, cool.
[256.38s -> 261.55s]  Vegas Knights? Yeah, I've, I'm such a, I'm such a fucking piece of shit.
[261.55s -> 262.55s]  You know why?
[262.55s -> 267.30s]  How many Vegas Golden Knights games do you think I've been to since moving to Vegas?
[267.30s -> 274.79s]  How many? None. That's right. Correct. Ding, ding, ding.
[274.79s -> 281.66s]  Absolute zero. Turn it backwards.
[281.66s -> 291.97s]  Oh, wow. I just de-aged again.
[291.97s -> 297.75s]  This kind of hurts, though. This is fellow kids.
[297.75s -> 303.22s]  Yeah, it is. This hurts my forehead.
[303.22s -> 305.22s]  No, I don't like it. That reminds me of VR.
[305.22s -> 308.22s]  And I don't have very much left in the front, so I don't want to do that.
[308.22s -> 316.22s]  It reminds me of a VR helmet.
[316.22s -> 318.22s]  So, what are we doing today? Well, nothing.
[318.22s -> 320.22s]  I've got about 40 minutes.
[320.22s -> 323.22s]  I figured if we look at the dog, we'd have a coffee.
[323.22s -> 326.22s]  We'd talk about a few things. A few important things.
[326.22s -> 331.22s]  This is new, by the way. So it's not, I don't, you notice I haven't been punching you in the face on stream anymore?
[331.22s -> 336.14s]  You notice that I haven't been just, like, absolutely just hammering your head?
[336.14s -> 341.73s]  I used to have a big, one of these that was just stuck out and it was a big pop filter. Not anymore.
[341.73s -> 343.73s]  And now I have this little one that still works pretty well.
[343.73s -> 346.54s]  A couple things.
[346.54s -> 353.19s]  This weekend, probably on either, probably Monday, either Sunday or Monday,
[353.19s -> 357.19s]  I'm shooting for Monday or Tuesday. You know me, though. It'll be Thursday.
[357.19s -> 360.37s]  The poll for the New Year's Eve.
[360.37s -> 363.37s]  I'm not going to be live for the next, like, eight or nine days.
[363.37s -> 366.96s]  Probably ten days, at least.
[366.96s -> 370.20s]  So, I'm not going to be able to announce when the voting is going to happen.
[370.20s -> 373.87s]  But the nominations are in. That's closed.
[373.87s -> 376.87s]  And voting is going to begin this coming week.
[376.87s -> 380.56s]  And I'm not going to be able to tell you, hey, by the way, go vote!
[380.56s -> 382.86s]  I'm doing that now.
[382.86s -> 385.86s]  So, this is a preemptive go vote on that poll.
[385.86s -> 389.86s]  So, share this clip of me talking about this to all your friends that know that they want to vote,
[389.86s -> 391.86s]  because it's going to be coming next week.
[391.86s -> 393.86s]  And I'm not going to be there to tell you about it.
[393.86s -> 395.86s]  I'm here telling you about it now.
[395.86s -> 399.32s]  This is a loser. Loser.
[399.32s -> 405.44s]  Maybe I should get back to fucking punching shit.
[405.44s -> 406.62s]  Right there!
[406.62s -> 410.30s]  Uh, stop counting. Yeah, whatever. Get out of here.
[410.30s -> 414.44s]  Alright, so that's going to... I'll tweet it, yeah.
[414.44s -> 417.44s]  Look, who even follows me, really, on Twitter anymore?
[417.44s -> 420.44s]  I make one post every, like, four years.
[420.44s -> 424.32s]  Like, you're probably not paying that much attention to what happens on my Twitter.
[424.32s -> 430.63s]  It's like, hey, I'm streaming right now, and then three years go by,
[430.63s -> 433.63s]  and I do, like, a fucking... I'm in the bathroom, like, washing my hands tweet.
[433.63s -> 448.36s]  Where's the whopper? Ow! That hurt!
[448.36s -> 456.22s]  I don't have it. Shit!
[456.22s -> 458.22s]  I knew I was forgetting something.
[458.22s -> 462.94s]  Oh, well. Liar. I knew it!
[462.94s -> 464.94s]  I was like, what am I forgetting today?
[464.94s -> 466.94s]  This is something I'm fucking forgetting.
[466.94s -> 471.97s]  Go get it now. I can't go get it now.
[471.97s -> 473.97s]  I can't go get it now!
[473.97s -> 481.88s]  Dude, delivery. It's not even going to get here.
[481.88s -> 483.88s]  What do you mean, dude, do, like, door dash?
[483.88s -> 485.88s]  It's not going to get here in time.
[485.88s -> 489.44s]  It's going to take, like, 30 or 40 minutes for me to get...
[489.44s -> 493.54s]  It always does that.
[493.54s -> 495.54s]  It's not like it's going to take too long.
[495.54s -> 497.54s]  It's going to show up here, and the stream's going to end,
[497.54s -> 499.54s]  and I'm just going to enjoy a gross whopper,
[499.54s -> 501.54s]  but I don't want to do that.
[501.54s -> 506.02s]  You only have 30 minutes.
[506.02s -> 509.28s]  I do? Oh, somebody just said in all capitals,
[509.28s -> 512.22s]  fuck you.
[512.22s -> 523.81s]  Shit. I'm in trouble.
[523.81s -> 528.65s]  Okay. Well, I didn't do it.
[528.65s -> 530.65s]  And I'll do it when I get back.
[530.65s -> 533.66s]  I promise. Nice crow's feet.
[533.66s -> 536.66s]  No, it's a fucking goddamn cybernetic augmentation!
[536.66s -> 540.56s]  Gives me 10% better eyesight.
[540.56s -> 549.97s]  He's a redneck fat ass.
[549.97s -> 553.23s]  What?
[553.23s -> 557.01s]  I'm like a skinny boy.
[557.01s -> 560.27s]  I'm not a grown-up yet.
[560.27s -> 562.58s]  What do you mean, skinny?
[562.58s -> 566.78s]  You guys don't think I'm skinny?
[566.78s -> 570.10s]  I'm like 150 pounds.
[570.10s -> 576.82s]  You are. I know.
[576.82s -> 578.82s]  I'm like 150, soaking wet.
[578.82s -> 583.88s]  Do the pancake recipe joke.
[583.88s -> 585.88s]  I don't have a gun.
[585.88s -> 587.88s]  I can't do a pancake recipe. I don't have a gun.
[587.88s -> 591.72s]  It's in a game.
[591.72s -> 593.72s]  Look, I do a thing in the video game.
[593.72s -> 595.72s]  Just look at the video.
[595.72s -> 597.72s]  It's called Secret Pancake Recipe.
[597.72s -> 601.43s]  I made it like fucking eight years ago.
[601.43s -> 607.90s]  Tell us your shitstain story.
[607.90s -> 612.44s]  Oh, also.
[612.44s -> 614.44s]  Hey. Listen to this.
[614.44s -> 616.44s]  You guys ready?
[616.44s -> 619.06s]  I got an announcement to make.
[619.06s -> 621.75s]  I have an announcement to make for you.
[621.75s -> 624.50s]  So.
[624.50s -> 626.50s]  Well, it's more like an announcement of an announcement.
[626.50s -> 628.50s]  But it's an announcement that
[628.50s -> 630.50s]  things are coming to this thing that people
[630.50s -> 633.00s]  were really into.
[633.00s -> 636.07s]  So you guys remember FTK?
[636.07s -> 638.57s]  Fuck the king. A couple of experiments we tried to do.
[638.57s -> 640.57s]  Tried to get like a thousand people in a server.
[640.57s -> 642.57s]  It was an experiment, right?
[642.57s -> 644.57s]  It was an experiment. It was an experiment.
[644.57s -> 646.57s]  It was fun. It was an experiment.
[646.57s -> 648.57s]  It was fun. So.
[648.57s -> 650.57s]  FTK has been
[650.57s -> 653.86s]  killed. The king is dead.
[653.86s -> 655.86s]  And from the ashes
[655.86s -> 658.36s]  in the king's grave is going to
[658.36s -> 663.08s]  rise. You ready?
[663.08s -> 665.45s]  An official JermaCraft
[665.45s -> 667.45s]  server for Minecraft where you can go
[667.45s -> 669.45s]  and hang out with your friends and build all kinds of
[669.45s -> 671.45s]  fun stuff. And there's gonna be like a survival. There's gonna be like
[671.45s -> 673.45s]  a bunch of cool stuff. There's gonna be like a map you can
[673.45s -> 676.33s]  walk around. There's gonna be a full on community
[676.33s -> 678.33s]  Minecraft server that will
[678.33s -> 680.95s]  exist forever. It
[680.95s -> 683.83s]  looks fucking awesome. It's currently
[683.83s -> 686.33s]  a work in progress. It looks
[686.33s -> 689.02s]  awesome.
[689.02s -> 691.02s]  I will share some things with you soon.
[691.02s -> 695.22s]  But I wanted to give an update on that.
[695.22s -> 697.22s]  It's going to be, the base is going to be
[697.22s -> 699.22s]  just vanilla Minecraft.
[699.22s -> 701.59s]  There'll probably be some additions later
[701.59s -> 704.39s]  as we add stuff to it.
[704.39s -> 706.39s]  But FTK is just becoming
[706.39s -> 708.57s]  a Minecraft server. That you guys
[708.57s -> 710.57s]  it'll be broken up into a bunch of different
[710.57s -> 713.00s]  world maps and the hub world
[713.00s -> 715.00s]  looks incredible. I cannot
[715.00s -> 717.00s]  tell you how awesome it looks. You'll see pretty soon.
[717.00s -> 719.50s]  We just get subs?
[719.50s -> 721.99s]  MysticQuest, thanks for the five community
[721.99s -> 725.45s]  subs! That was really loud.
[725.45s -> 728.52s]  And like my chair shocked
[728.52s -> 732.55s]  me. Tuber voice. That wasn't even a tuber voice.
[732.55s -> 734.55s]  That was a chewing gum from the 90s
[734.55s -> 737.43s]  commercial voice. There's over 45
[737.43s -> 740.57s]  different flavors! Whoa!
[740.57s -> 746.46s]  Uh, Freddy's, what the fuck?
[746.46s -> 751.00s]  Freddy Dredge has
[751.00s -> 753.00s]  50 subs. The last two days has been like
[753.00s -> 755.00s]  just sub the, just like
[755.00s -> 757.50s]  sub the fuck out of me! That's
[757.50s -> 760.36s]  50! Freddy!
[760.36s -> 765.35s]  Oh my god, dude.
[765.35s -> 767.35s]  Cry, cry, cry, cry.
[767.35s -> 769.35s]  There's been like 2000 subs in
[769.35s -> 771.35s]  48 hours. Something insane.
[771.35s -> 780.17s]  Sing the cry song.
[780.17s -> 782.17s]  How do you sing the cry song?
[782.17s -> 786.14s]  I don't know what that means.
[786.14s -> 789.59s]  He's in a new tax bracket.
[789.59s -> 794.89s]  Smash the hand.
[794.89s -> 797.51s]  Sing it, coward.
[797.51s -> 799.51s]  Come over here, coward. Come over here, coward.
[799.51s -> 805.08s]  Hey, you flipped me off.
[805.08s -> 807.08s]  Uh, Jeremy, please.
[807.08s -> 809.08s]  Give me some questions. Give me some questions for me
[809.08s -> 811.08s]  for like another 20 minutes before I leave.
[811.08s -> 821.05s]  No taxes on bits.
[821.05s -> 823.05s]  I don't think you know how that works.
[823.05s -> 828.55s]  But, it's okay.
[828.55s -> 830.73s]  Hold on a minute.
[830.73s -> 833.42s]  We've got another five
[833.42s -> 836.04s]  community subs!
[836.04s -> 838.04s]  From xparta45, thanks xparta.
[838.04s -> 840.04s]  This is just continuing from last night, I feel.
[840.04s -> 842.79s]  Hey, nice to see you. Nice to see you too.
[842.79s -> 848.68s]  Get that gross thing off there.
[848.68s -> 853.67s]  Do some ASMR, okay?
[853.67s -> 859.43s]  People are going to freak out if I do that.
[859.43s -> 865.77s]  This kind of looks like a pineapple upside down cake.
[865.77s -> 869.22s]  You know what I mean, doesn't it?
[869.22s -> 871.22s]  Oh, no.
[871.22s -> 873.22s]  I'm literally sitting here
[873.22s -> 875.53s]  drinking coffee.
[875.53s -> 878.34s]  I don't deserve this amount of money.
[878.34s -> 880.34s]  I do not deserve this.
[880.34s -> 882.34s]  I've just made a coffee and put a fucking
[882.34s -> 884.34s]  Vegas Golden Knights hat on
[884.34s -> 886.34s]  and sat down and told you about a Minecraft server.
[886.34s -> 888.71s]  Somebody's like 25 subs.
[888.71s -> 895.18s]  Who was that?
[895.18s -> 897.18s]  Who just gave the 25 subs?
[897.18s -> 899.42s]  Four but just came in with five.
[899.42s -> 901.42s]  Who just gave 25 subs?
[901.42s -> 905.90s]  What the fuck is going on?
[905.90s -> 910.38s]  Is this going to turn off?
[910.38s -> 912.38s]  This is still going from last night.
[912.38s -> 915.90s]  Who just gave the 25?
[915.90s -> 919.29s]  Hold on.
[919.29s -> 921.29s]  Can I take a sip of this fucking coffee?
[921.29s -> 923.29s]  I'm just holding it like a wax museum.
[923.29s -> 929.75s]  Will the Minecraft server be sub only?
[929.75s -> 932.12s]  No, but you're going to have to get white listed.
[932.12s -> 934.68s]  You'll get white listed through the Discord.
[934.68s -> 936.68s]  So no one's going to have to pay
[936.68s -> 938.86s]  to play here.
[938.86s -> 941.16s]  But you're going to have to get white listed through the Discord.
[941.16s -> 943.16s]  So no, there's not going to be a sub
[943.16s -> 945.16s]  requirement at all. But there will be a Discord
[945.16s -> 948.10s]  white listing requirement.
[948.10s -> 950.10s]  No, I don't want people to have to pay for that.
[950.10s -> 952.10s]  Every time I think about that, I'm like, no.
[952.10s -> 954.10s]  That's fucking stupid. I don't want to do that.
[954.10s -> 956.10s]  Like, oh, you've got to have...
[956.10s -> 958.10s]  Look, it's $5 a month to pay.
[958.10s -> 960.10s]  If I did that, let's say it was
[960.10s -> 962.10s]  $5 a month for you to play on that server
[962.10s -> 964.10s]  and you don't even care, you just want to play on the Minecraft server.
[964.10s -> 967.16s]  The hosting for that server,
[967.16s -> 970.36s]  it would be...
[970.36s -> 972.36s]  That would be way more money taking in
[972.36s -> 974.36s]  than I should be taking in.
[974.36s -> 977.99s]  So, no.
[977.99s -> 982.02s]  Why would I do that? My penis...
[982.02s -> 985.35s]  Whatever.
[985.35s -> 987.59s]  You should get a nose job.
[987.59s -> 993.93s]  You think so? Yeah, I know. It goes like this.
[993.93s -> 995.93s]  It's all broken and shit.
[995.93s -> 1000.41s]  No, I don't care. It's how God made me. I don't give a fuck.
[1000.41s -> 1003.61s]  It's how God made me.
[1003.61s -> 1005.85s]  He started sketching.
[1005.85s -> 1008.28s]  He got about to be right here.
[1008.28s -> 1010.28s]  Somebody grabbed his attention.
[1010.28s -> 1012.28s]  God, there's an earthquake. What?
[1012.28s -> 1014.28s]  And he smudged with his pencil.
[1014.28s -> 1016.28s]  I'll fix that later.
[1016.28s -> 1018.71s]  He got down to here.
[1018.71s -> 1020.71s]  He sneezed. Oh, shit.
[1020.71s -> 1022.71s]  That's all right. That's how I made him.
[1025.53s -> 1027.96s]  That's how it looks okay.
[1027.96s -> 1030.71s]  Then he got to about here.
[1030.71s -> 1032.71s]  And he's like, you know what?
[1032.71s -> 1034.71s]  Let's make a big mouth.
[1034.71s -> 1036.71s]  I was his funny character creator.
[1036.71s -> 1046.44s]  You don't think God made you into a character creator?
[1046.44s -> 1050.09s]  Listen to this at work.
[1050.09s -> 1052.09s]  Be careful. I don't want you to get fired or anything.
[1052.09s -> 1054.71s]  Get out of work.
[1054.71s -> 1057.78s]  I don't want your boss to come over and be like, what the fuck is this guy?
[1057.78s -> 1062.65s]  Oh, shit. Hey, bro.
[1062.65s -> 1065.40s]  I got the report.
[1065.40s -> 1067.40s]  You're doing a great job, man.
[1067.40s -> 1069.88s]  I'm working here.
[1069.88s -> 1071.88s]  You really helped me out here.
[1071.88s -> 1074.44s]  You did a huge thing for me.
[1074.44s -> 1076.44s]  I'm working here, remote.
[1076.44s -> 1078.87s]  You're there.
[1078.87s -> 1080.87s]  The work that I have for you
[1080.87s -> 1083.18s]  will be done soon.
[1083.18s -> 1085.18s]  You've helped me way more than I do.
[1085.18s -> 1089.38s]  You do so much more work than me.
[1089.38s -> 1091.38s]  I'm just really happy that I have somebody like you that I can kind of
[1091.38s -> 1093.38s]  communicate with that can help me
[1093.38s -> 1095.82s]  get work done for the boss.
[1095.82s -> 1098.57s]  Because he's like fucking...
[1098.57s -> 1100.87s]  He sucks.
[1100.87s -> 1103.94s]  He is such a fucking loser.
[1103.94s -> 1105.94s]  I know you guys, I know you like him.
[1105.94s -> 1107.94s]  You like him and you think he's really cool
[1107.94s -> 1109.94s]  and smart and funny and stuff.
[1109.94s -> 1111.94s]  He fucking sucks, dude.
[1111.94s -> 1113.94s]  And I don't even care if I get like, I don't know.
[1113.94s -> 1116.89s]  If he ever hears this, whatever.
[1116.89s -> 1118.89s]  Which is like, I find fucking annoying.
[1118.89s -> 1122.28s]  But, whatever.
[1122.28s -> 1129.06s]  I don't think he's an idiot.
[1129.06s -> 1131.06s]  You got that guy fired.
[1131.06s -> 1133.56s]  No I didn't. The boss is peering over with like
[1133.56s -> 1135.56s]  his glasses looking down.
[1135.56s -> 1137.56s]  And he hears like, oh you like him.
[1137.56s -> 1139.56s]  And I'm like, fuck him.
[1139.56s -> 1143.40s]  He stands up for me?
[1143.40s -> 1147.88s]  I don't remember that.
[1147.88s -> 1149.88s]  This is a stall stream.
[1149.88s -> 1153.78s]  There's nothing to stall to.
[1153.78s -> 1163.11s]  Are you Ellis from Left 4 Dead?
[1163.11s -> 1167.27s]  Oh shit. I mean, a little.
[1167.27s -> 1171.75s]  Stall 2 for the Whopper stream.
[1171.75s -> 1175.98s]  This is one.
[1175.98s -> 1177.98s]  Do the voice.
[1177.98s -> 1180.41s]  What does Ellis talk like?
[1180.41s -> 1182.41s]  Oh man, that's me Ellis. I'm hanging out here with my gun.
[1182.41s -> 1185.08s]  I don't know nothing about that.
[1185.08s -> 1194.55s]  Is that how he talks?
[1194.55s -> 1205.43s]  I haven't played the game in like fucking 4 years.
[1205.43s -> 1207.43s]  What about Community Content Night?
[1207.43s -> 1209.43s]  Oh alright, we can talk about that.
[1209.43s -> 1211.43s]  So, Community Content Night is
[1211.43s -> 1216.10s]  like FTK, also dead.
[1216.10s -> 1219.30s]  Sad to say.
[1219.30s -> 1222.76s]  The reason is because the Twitch DMCA
[1222.76s -> 1225.58s]  shit, there is no reliable way
[1225.58s -> 1227.58s]  I can show videos like that on stream
[1227.58s -> 1230.33s]  in a row.
[1230.33s -> 1232.82s]  Unfortunately, all the
[1232.82s -> 1235.13s]  best like possibilities
[1235.13s -> 1237.62s]  like in Harry Potter,
[1237.62s -> 1240.44s]  you know, think about it, right?
[1240.44s -> 1242.44s]  I sat in front of a green screen and said, put this in the Saw
[1242.44s -> 1245.00s]  movie. Hey look, I'm a
[1245.00s -> 1247.00s]  Harry Potter character.
[1247.00s -> 1249.43s]  You can't really do that anymore.
[1249.43s -> 1252.25s]  And I don't want to have
[1252.25s -> 1254.25s]  insane heavy restrictions on it because I feel like
[1254.25s -> 1256.25s]  the best videos are when you guys do whatever the fuck you want.
[1256.25s -> 1258.49s]  So I wouldn't want to be like,
[1258.49s -> 1260.49s]  it's going to be the original background, original music,
[1260.49s -> 1262.49s]  only original character, and only
[1262.49s -> 1264.49s]  like an original foreground, and
[1264.49s -> 1266.73s]  good luck. By the way,
[1266.73s -> 1268.73s]  I say Harry Potter in this clip 35
[1268.73s -> 1270.97s]  times. Good luck.
[1270.97s -> 1273.91s]  No idea how you're going to do that.
[1273.91s -> 1276.66s]  So that's just not going to happen anymore.
[1276.66s -> 1278.66s]  And it's sad to say it,
[1278.66s -> 1281.42s]  but that was
[1281.42s -> 1283.42s]  about a full half of those streams.
[1283.42s -> 1285.85s]  So, the idea,
[1285.85s -> 1288.86s]  and I don't know,
[1288.86s -> 1291.48s]  I think this is okay for me to say,
[1291.48s -> 1293.48s]  the idea is maybe to make a mega playlist
[1293.48s -> 1296.49s]  with the videos.
[1296.49s -> 1299.05s]  A huge one, a mega one.
[1299.05s -> 1302.25s]  And queue it up in the Discord
[1302.25s -> 1304.25s]  and just have a night where
[1304.25s -> 1306.25s]  we just, in the Discord, it's just playing
[1306.25s -> 1308.62s]  and we're all there. Somehow.
[1308.62s -> 1310.98s]  I'm trying to figure out what to do about it.
[1310.98s -> 1312.98s]  Kind of like a watch party, essentially,
[1312.98s -> 1315.99s]  in Discord. Because we can't do it
[1315.99s -> 1319.51s]  here. And I don't really want to do it on YouTube
[1319.51s -> 1321.51s]  either because YouTube also has the same problems.
[1321.51s -> 1323.51s]  And I don't really want to stream on YouTube because
[1323.51s -> 1326.20s]  I don't want to do that.
[1326.20s -> 1329.08s]  What the fuck is a Discord?
[1329.08s -> 1331.08s]  It's a service where you can get online and talk to friends.
[1331.08s -> 1333.45s]  It's like Skype, but way better.
[1333.45s -> 1335.45s]  It's just a way better version of
[1335.45s -> 1343.11s]  Skype. There you go.
[1343.11s -> 1345.11s]  Disc or mega lol. Okay, whatever.
[1345.11s -> 1347.11s]  But the artwork is
[1347.11s -> 1349.11s]  essentially started to transition into
[1349.11s -> 1351.48s]  the BRB screen. And I know there's
[1351.48s -> 1353.78s]  some kinks to work out.
[1353.78s -> 1355.78s]  There's things that we have to figure out how I'm going to do that.
[1355.78s -> 1358.22s]  Because I think
[1358.22s -> 1360.22s]  after talking to Lazy Luke
[1360.22s -> 1362.84s]  that the backlog of art
[1362.84s -> 1364.84s]  is still slowly
[1364.84s -> 1366.84s]  getting chipped away at.
[1366.84s -> 1368.84s]  And I would have to do more
[1368.84s -> 1371.77s]  BRBs. But
[1371.77s -> 1374.14s]  I don't know if I necessarily want to do that.
[1374.14s -> 1376.14s]  I don't think I want to have to be like,
[1376.14s -> 1378.31s]  I gotta take a break now.
[1378.31s -> 1380.31s]  Because if I don't take a break now, let's
[1380.31s -> 1382.31s]  do a five minute break. I'll see you later so we can show art.
[1382.31s -> 1384.55s]  Although
[1384.55s -> 1388.01s]  I could do it at the end of streams.
[1388.01s -> 1390.01s]  But the problem with doing it at the end of a stream is
[1390.01s -> 1392.01s]  I am doing the thing that I deliberately
[1392.01s -> 1394.44s]  removed like four or five months ago.
[1394.44s -> 1396.44s]  Where we hang out and sit there
[1396.44s -> 1398.44s]  for half an hour,
[1398.44s -> 1400.44s]  twenty, fifteen, twenty, thirty, forty minutes.
[1400.44s -> 1402.44s]  And we do a post stream wind down and I got rid of that
[1402.44s -> 1405.75s]  deliberately. So that's not going to happen.
[1405.75s -> 1408.12s]  So what could happen
[1408.12s -> 1410.55s]  is during, I guess,
[1410.55s -> 1412.55s]  I could do either like an art
[1412.55s -> 1414.79s]  stream. But the thing about
[1414.79s -> 1416.79s]  doing an art stream is that's just
[1416.79s -> 1418.79s]  community content night. And community content night had the videos
[1418.79s -> 1420.79s]  and it was like a big thing. It was like, oh we're going to do the art.
[1420.79s -> 1422.79s]  Then we're going to do the videos, we're going to do the music.
[1422.79s -> 1425.03s]  And it just sucks
[1425.03s -> 1427.98s]  that we can't do it all. Could do pre-stream too.
[1427.98s -> 1430.15s]  There could be a thing
[1430.15s -> 1432.15s]  during the planets, right?
[1432.15s -> 1434.15s]  Where it's
[1434.15s -> 1436.15s]  and then in the corner for like, you know, five to ten minutes
[1436.15s -> 1438.15s]  is, or like big enough obviously
[1438.15s -> 1440.65s]  the starting soon would be in the corner.
[1440.65s -> 1442.65s]  Do that. Have it run during the starting soon screen.
[1442.65s -> 1445.59s]  I think that makes sense too.
[1445.59s -> 1449.69s]  He's flustered. A little because it's
[1449.69s -> 1451.69s]  annoying that I have to, I have to
[1451.69s -> 1453.69s]  remove and delete essentially one of my favorite things
[1453.69s -> 1455.86s]  on the entire channel. Which was like the
[1455.86s -> 1457.86s]  screen screen community, not content night stuff.
[1457.86s -> 1459.86s]  Like that shit was fucking hilarious.
[1459.86s -> 1462.79s]  So it's annoying that
[1462.79s -> 1465.48s]  one of my favorite things essentially has to go away.
[1465.48s -> 1469.64s]  I just rambled for a little while
[1469.64s -> 1471.64s]  but you know I haven't talked, we have not talked about this yet.
[1471.64s -> 1477.98s]  So, do it on YouTube. Yeah
[1477.98s -> 1479.98s]  I don't want to do it on YouTube. No.
[1479.98s -> 1485.34s]  The same problems. I like the rambling.
[1485.34s -> 1489.54s]  Well good. I'm glad. Cheers to you.
[1489.54s -> 1493.13s]  I don't know why I did that. That probably hurt.
[1493.13s -> 1495.13s]  I'm really sorry. I just like did that inside of your ear.
[1495.13s -> 1505.86s]  Ramble Andy.
[1505.86s -> 1514.70s]  Go to mixer. That's funny.
[1514.70s -> 1516.70s]  Go back to gaslighting.
[1516.70s -> 1520.60s]  You want to see the dog again? Oh what I was going to say about the dog.
[1520.60s -> 1522.90s]  So he pulls the blankets off
[1522.90s -> 1524.90s]  and lies over on next to the bed sometimes.
[1524.90s -> 1527.21s]  It's like he prefers
[1527.21s -> 1529.21s]  he's such a Goldilocks dog. Sometimes he
[1529.21s -> 1531.83s]  prefers a soft bed.
[1531.83s -> 1533.83s]  And other times he prefers like a hard
[1533.83s -> 1536.58s]  ground. It's 50-50.
[1536.58s -> 1538.58s]  I have no idea. He sees Goldilocks.
[1538.58s -> 1540.58s]  No, no. He's the Goldilocks bears.
[1540.58s -> 1542.82s]  All in one animal. That's more accurate.
[1542.82s -> 1545.51s]  So
[1545.51s -> 1548.20s]  anybody got any more questions?
[1548.20s -> 1551.08s]  This is just a question stream. I'll answer anything.
[1551.08s -> 1553.90s]  I will answer anything.
[1553.90s -> 1555.90s]  You could write anything. As long as it was
[1555.90s -> 1557.90s]  TOS friendly. I would answer literally any question.
[1557.90s -> 1561.61s]  What is it? What's your name? Jeremy.
[1561.61s -> 1564.30s]  Done. Easy. Will you marry me? No.
[1564.30s -> 1568.25s]  Do I
[1568.25s -> 1570.25s]  poop? Of course I do.
[1570.25s -> 1572.25s]  That's part of my digestive system. All humans
[1572.25s -> 1577.67s]  do, of course. Can I have? No.
[1577.67s -> 1579.67s]  How's your day? It's going pretty good. It's going well.
[1579.67s -> 1583.51s]  It's going very good. Will I make it through my audit?
[1583.51s -> 1586.52s]  Yeah, just make sure
[1586.52s -> 1588.95s]  you play by the rules and make sure you give
[1588.95s -> 1591.13s]  all the documents and
[1591.13s -> 1593.13s]  work with the IRS.
[1593.13s -> 1595.69s]  You can work with the IRS somehow.
[1595.69s -> 1601.26s]  Yeah, you'll be good. Do you drink Dr.
[1601.26s -> 1603.26s]  Pepper? I have not had a sip of Dr. Pepper
[1603.26s -> 1605.26s]  in probably four or five months.
[1605.26s -> 1607.94s]  Before that it was probably a couple of years.
[1607.94s -> 1609.94s]  I just wear it because I like the shirt.
[1609.94s -> 1614.10s]  I'm an old fan.
[1614.10s -> 1620.57s]  Pirates, knights, or cowboys?
[1620.57s -> 1623.18s]  Pirates for fun, knights for protection,
[1623.18s -> 1625.18s]  and cowboys for...
[1625.18s -> 1633.24s]  No, this is not
[1633.24s -> 1635.67s]  like a sexual thing. What are you talking about?
[1635.67s -> 1638.30s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1638.30s -> 1640.30s]  Pirates are like... If I was on a pirate ship
[1640.30s -> 1642.30s]  it would be like we sing songs and like drink
[1642.30s -> 1644.66s]  and sail.
[1644.66s -> 1647.10s]  A knight has like a huge...
[1647.10s -> 1649.10s]  can protect you. He's got like a sword and a shield
[1649.10s -> 1651.72s]  and stuff. A cowboy...
[1651.72s -> 1654.60s]  for food! A cowboy
[1654.60s -> 1656.60s]  for food. If I want to have
[1656.60s -> 1658.60s]  a lot of food. Is there like... they can
[1658.60s -> 1662.57s]  get... they're cowboys, right?
[1662.57s -> 1664.57s]  I don't know. Farmers? Cowboys? They're kind of...
[1664.57s -> 1667.00s]  Cowboys used to have their own
[1667.00s -> 1669.00s]  source of food. They had to get their hunt and stuff, right?
[1669.00s -> 1674.50s]  They're not eating other cowboys.
[1674.50s -> 1678.28s]  Do you... What's your favorite... What?
[1678.28s -> 1681.35s]  Do you eat beans? I do.
[1681.35s -> 1686.92s]  Refried beans are one of my favorite things. Any news
[1686.92s -> 1688.92s]  on the D&D game? Star
[1688.92s -> 1690.92s]  is currently working on his project
[1690.92s -> 1693.10s]  which is going very well.
[1693.10s -> 1695.10s]  So we had a conversation that was just like, hey, whenever
[1695.10s -> 1697.46s]  you're... Just you do your project
[1697.46s -> 1699.46s]  and do it as best you can and then maybe later
[1699.46s -> 1701.46s]  you'll be able to get heavy, heavy
[1701.46s -> 1703.46s]  work on the German 951.
[1703.46s -> 1706.73s]  So he's got his thing
[1706.73s -> 1708.73s]  going now. And I don't want to... I didn't want to be like
[1708.73s -> 1710.73s]  oh, hey, well, fuck it. You're gonna do mine.
[1710.73s -> 1712.73s]  Forget about your project. No, it's
[1712.73s -> 1716.57s]  going very well, so... Do I smell?
[1716.57s -> 1719.58s]  Yeah. Do I smell bad? No.
[1719.58s -> 1721.58s]  I do... I emanate some type of fragrance
[1721.58s -> 1732.06s]  though. What's your opinion? I missed it.
[1732.06s -> 1735.64s]  Fucking door spring behind you.
[1735.64s -> 1740.12s]  This thing? I would even pick
[1740.12s -> 1747.42s]  that up. Touch it. Go flick
[1747.42s -> 1759.69s]  it. Okay, fine.
[1759.69s -> 1765.96s]  You happy? You made a loud
[1765.96s -> 1774.58s]  noise too. I forgot.
[1774.58s -> 1776.58s]  You can't... Like on Twitch
[1776.58s -> 1778.58s]  you have to just be a torso.
[1778.58s -> 1781.02s]  You cannot... People cannot know
[1781.02s -> 1783.02s]  that you have anything below the torso.
[1783.02s -> 1785.70s]  See, and now Otto's annoyed. I just
[1785.70s -> 1787.70s]  like... I just did that thing and he's like
[1787.70s -> 1789.70s]  fucking... What the fuck, dude? I was sleeping.
[1789.70s -> 1794.74s]  You did that. I didn't.
[1794.74s -> 1796.74s]  You have to just be a floating
[1796.74s -> 1800.20s]  upper body. When's German Rumble 2020?
[1800.20s -> 1802.50s]  New Year's Eve. Oh, hello.
[1802.50s -> 1807.22s]  New Year's Eve. Why do I look like a college
[1807.22s -> 1809.22s]  kid? Because I have a hat on. You want me to take it off and
[1809.22s -> 1812.55s]  be Jeremy again? Sure.
[1812.55s -> 1814.55s]  Alright. I'm just gonna... Whatever. I don't even need the hat anymore. Who cares?
[1814.55s -> 1820.62s]  Boomer. Maybe
[1820.62s -> 1826.12s]  a little. Your hair looks small.
[1826.12s -> 1840.65s]  It's... I was trying to hold in
[1840.65s -> 1842.65s]  a fart right there and I promise I wasn't. I just was
[1842.65s -> 1848.86s]  doing that. I don't know why. Do a wink.
[1848.86s -> 1850.86s]  That was Robert De Niro.
[1850.86s -> 1860.63s]  I don't think... Easiest impression
[1860.63s -> 1862.63s]  ever. Just like crush your face a little bit
[1862.63s -> 1869.35s]  and tilt your head around. Any chance
[1869.35s -> 1871.35s]  of... I missed it. What does it say? Any chance of...
[1871.35s -> 1874.79s]  Any chance of... When are you
[1874.79s -> 1878.31s]  gonna collab with Nianers? What the fuck was
[1878.31s -> 1880.74s]  that? When am I gonna collab with Nianers?
[1880.74s -> 1883.75s]  Nianers is... Nianers is very funny.
[1883.75s -> 1886.57s]  I don't know.
[1886.57s -> 1888.57s]  I don't know. We kind of did last night.
[1888.57s -> 1890.57s]  We were like sent the
[1890.57s -> 1893.06s]  clip thing.
[1893.06s -> 1900.94s]  We like sent... We went back and forth with like clips
[1900.94s -> 1904.20s]  on stream. Mind playing Jet Set
[1904.20s -> 1906.20s]  Radio for a stream? I did and I fucking couldn't
[1906.20s -> 1908.20s]  do it. I like couldn't do it. I freaked
[1908.20s -> 1916.33s]  out. Do a slime stream. I know.
[1916.33s -> 1918.33s]  There's so many things that I want to do but I
[1918.33s -> 1922.42s]  just didn't. You gonna be a VTuber?
[1922.42s -> 1925.43s]  Would I make a good VTuber?
[1925.43s -> 1927.80s]  I don't know. Probably not.
[1927.80s -> 1940.26s]  Christmas stream.
[1940.26s -> 1943.08s]  Not this year. New Year's stream.
[1943.08s -> 1947.82s]  Uh...
[1947.82s -> 1951.85s]  Nianers believed you could do it.
[1951.85s -> 1954.79s]  Well that's a huge endorsement.
[1954.79s -> 1957.54s]  What would I... How would I... I don't
[1957.54s -> 1964.58s]  know. What about German Direct?
[1964.58s -> 1968.28s]  Um...
[1968.28s -> 1970.28s]  I don't have much to show besides the New Year's Eve
[1970.28s -> 1972.46s]  thing and the Minecraft thing. It'd be like
[1972.46s -> 1974.46s]  a Blizzcon 2019.
[1974.46s -> 1978.17s]  People would be fucking mad at me.
[1978.17s -> 1980.17s]  Oh! But shit I gotta charge like $400
[1980.17s -> 1990.92s]  a ticket though. Will you... What does it say?
[1990.92s -> 1996.30s]  If you do Mr. Slime, let me
[1996.30s -> 1998.30s]  do it. Um... I have no
[1998.30s -> 2000.30s]  idea what I would even do.
[2000.30s -> 2002.30s]  I would have to get like a... I would have to like get
[2002.30s -> 2004.30s]  something blocked out of my brain first before
[2004.30s -> 2006.30s]  I even took that step. But somebody
[2006.30s -> 2009.50s]  just gave a shitload of money.
[2009.50s -> 2011.50s]  That was Chef Lazarus for 25
[2011.50s -> 2013.50s]  subs. So many subs.
[2013.50s -> 2015.50s]  I think... I think we broke it. Did we break it?
[2015.50s -> 2022.14s]  Let's see. Uh... I think we broke...
[2022.14s -> 2031.42s]  I think it's an all time high. Let's see.
[2031.42s -> 2034.23s]  I think we did it. When I
[2034.23s -> 2036.23s]  say we I mean you because like
[2036.23s -> 2038.23s]  I'm just receiving this and
[2038.23s -> 2040.86s]  sometimes I don't know why. Uh...
[2040.86s -> 2043.29s]  The channel has broken.
[2043.29s -> 2046.62s]  11,000 subscribers.
[2046.62s -> 2048.62s]  Just fucking ridiculous.
[2048.62s -> 2050.62s]  Uh... I believe the all
[2050.62s -> 2053.43s]  time high is
[2053.43s -> 2056.89s]  not very close to... I don't know. I don't like
[2056.89s -> 2058.89s]  keep track of this if I'm honest.
[2058.89s -> 2061.13s]  I don't like want to keep track of this
[2061.13s -> 2063.13s]  because I feel like then it becomes
[2063.13s -> 2065.13s]  something I have to care about and I don't want that.
[2065.13s -> 2067.62s]  So I don't really pay
[2067.62s -> 2069.62s]  that much attention to that.
[2069.62s -> 2072.18s]  So that's a lot
[2072.18s -> 2076.02s]  of fucking money. He doesn't care about
[2076.02s -> 2078.02s]  gift subs. No, I do. I very much
[2078.02s -> 2080.02s]  do. But I don't ever want that
[2080.02s -> 2082.02s]  to be like a number that I like
[2082.02s -> 2086.38s]  chase every day. And it's fluctuated
[2086.38s -> 2088.38s]  a lot. I mean it's gone.
[2088.38s -> 2090.38s]  It's... It has gone like wham
[2090.38s -> 2092.68s]  wham. My schedule is so erratic.
[2092.68s -> 2094.68s]  I take a lot of breaks. I don't pay attention
[2094.68s -> 2096.68s]  to that. If it ha... Again this is...
[2096.68s -> 2098.68s]  I said the word subscriber and we talked about all
[2098.68s -> 2101.30s]  I shouldn't have even said it. But this
[2101.30s -> 2103.30s]  is a lot of money and I just don't want
[2103.30s -> 2106.57s]  to pay that much attention to it. Um...
[2106.57s -> 2108.81s]  Chef Lazarus... I can't...
[2108.81s -> 2110.81s]  Somebody just gave 50. Hold on. I gotta pull this up.
[2110.81s -> 2116.68s]  That's a lot of money.
[2116.68s -> 2119.43s]  How much... What did you just give?
[2119.43s -> 2121.43s]  That was Wesley. Wesley gave 50
[2121.43s -> 2124.89s]  community subs.
[2124.89s -> 2126.89s]  We broke it. We definitely broke it.
[2126.89s -> 2128.89s]  So we don't have to do anymore.
[2128.89s -> 2131.96s]  It's absolutely been broken.
[2131.96s -> 2133.96s]  The stream is absolutely... This is the new subscriber
[2133.96s -> 2136.39s]  high. Last time it happened
[2136.39s -> 2139.34s]  was like this exact time
[2139.34s -> 2144.07s]  period last year. That's
[2144.07s -> 2149.45s]  insane. End of December into the
[2149.45s -> 2151.45s]  first of January. That's what happened last time.
[2151.45s -> 2154.39s]  But thanks guys. It's completely
[2154.39s -> 2156.39s]  unnecessary. We don't have... You don't have
[2156.39s -> 2158.39s]  to give anymore subs. We don't have to do it anymore.
[2158.39s -> 2160.39s]  Like you don't have to. This is like
[2160.39s -> 2162.57s]  already an insane number. And
[2162.57s -> 2165.64s]  we don't have to do like a
[2165.64s -> 2167.64s]  sub train today. We don't have to do
[2167.64s -> 2169.64s]  that. That doesn't have to happen.
[2169.64s -> 2172.07s]  It doesn't have to happen.
[2172.07s -> 2174.07s]  I don't need it to happen. I don't like want
[2174.07s -> 2176.07s]  you to do that. I know
[2176.07s -> 2178.07s]  that I'm just... I keep saying the word
[2178.07s -> 2180.89s]  so people are going to do it. But I
[2180.89s -> 2183.64s]  will tell you, if you have
[2183.64s -> 2187.61s]  other streamers that you watch,
[2187.61s -> 2189.61s]  I would rather you
[2189.61s -> 2191.61s]  sub to them. I would rather you
[2191.61s -> 2193.61s]  support a smaller streamer
[2193.61s -> 2195.61s]  or a streamer that you enjoy
[2195.61s -> 2197.61s]  that you know might not have 11
[2197.61s -> 2200.04s]  fucking thousand subscriptions.
[2200.04s -> 2203.16s]  You know what I'm saying? It's
[2203.16s -> 2205.16s]  an incredibly overwhelming thing.
[2205.16s -> 2207.16s]  I can't believe that this many people pay this much
[2207.16s -> 2209.66s]  money. But if you have a
[2209.66s -> 2212.97s]  choice between like a few
[2212.97s -> 2214.97s]  different people and you know that I'm about to
[2214.97s -> 2217.59s]  hit like fucking 12,000 subs,
[2217.59s -> 2219.90s]  support them. Because you know that I
[2219.90s -> 2224.57s]  would much prefer that. If you don't,
[2224.57s -> 2229.24s]  but if it's just me, if it's just
[2229.24s -> 2231.74s]  me, then alright. But no, I'm kidding.
[2231.74s -> 2237.16s]  He's doing
[2237.16s -> 2239.53s]  reverse psychology. Alright, well then
[2239.53s -> 2241.70s]  okay. If I do regular
[2241.70s -> 2243.70s]  regular psychology,
[2243.70s -> 2246.07s]  if I say do it, then that
[2246.07s -> 2254.71s]  means you won't do it. There's a burp coming in.
[2254.71s -> 2258.15s]  I can't even
[2258.15s -> 2260.15s]  count. This is so many that just came in. All
[2260.15s -> 2262.15s]  five. Five fifty. Ten
[2262.15s -> 2264.15s]  from Captain Dark. Five edgy shadow.
[2264.15s -> 2266.15s]  Five anonymous gifted. This is the same exact thing
[2266.15s -> 2269.54s]  happened yesterday. Now, and I want
[2269.54s -> 2273.83s]  another thing too. Especially
[2273.83s -> 2275.83s]  like now. You know
[2275.83s -> 2278.97s]  what I mean? Like 2020's been fucked. I'd rather
[2278.97s -> 2280.97s]  you spend that money on like you, your friends, and
[2280.97s -> 2284.47s]  your family than me.
[2284.47s -> 2286.47s]  Take care of yourselves. Make sure you do that first.
[2286.47s -> 2288.47s]  Put me at the bottom of your fucking list.
[2288.47s -> 2292.10s]  I really hope you are. Put me
[2292.10s -> 2294.10s]  at the very bottom of your list of
[2294.10s -> 2297.24s]  places where you think your money should be going.
[2297.24s -> 2299.24s]  Take care of yourself. Take care of your family. Take care of your friends.
[2299.24s -> 2303.53s]  Absolutely. Like I
[2303.53s -> 2305.53s]  It's been a fucking rough year. And I
[2305.53s -> 2308.90s]  really hope that you guys
[2308.90s -> 2316.46s]  are taking care of yourselves. Ban the subs.
[2316.46s -> 2321.26s]  Jeremy, you're getting coal for
[2321.26s -> 2331.10s]  Christmas.
[2331.10s -> 2334.23s]  Are you gonna finish Saw II? Why would
[2334.23s -> 2336.23s]  I finish Saw II?
[2336.23s -> 2338.23s]  Did you hear how much I was
[2338.23s -> 2340.23s]  not having fun in that game?
[2340.23s -> 2344.90s]  I'm not gonna finish. I'm not gonna
[2344.90s -> 2346.90s]  open Saw II again. I don't know what the
[2346.90s -> 2351.32s]  disk is. I think I threw it away.
[2351.32s -> 2354.90s]  Yes. Yeah.
[2354.90s -> 2360.28s]  But that's behind you?
[2360.28s -> 2374.74s]  I know. There's a dog behind me.
[2374.74s -> 2376.74s]  Here he comes.
[2376.74s -> 2378.92s]  Oh, big stretch.
[2378.92s -> 2382.76s]  You missed it.
[2382.76s -> 2384.76s]  I really hate to do this
[2384.76s -> 2386.76s]  but I've gotta go in like
[2386.76s -> 2389.64s]  a minute. I think I'm just gonna
[2389.64s -> 2391.64s]  turn the stream on and
[2391.64s -> 2393.64s]  hey everybody. Just going
[2393.64s -> 2395.64s]  live for like 40 minutes and collecting
[2395.64s -> 2398.33s]  subs. Thanks everybody. Appreciate
[2398.33s -> 2400.33s]  the fucking 600 subs
[2400.33s -> 2402.33s]  that just came in. Alright, see you later
[2402.33s -> 2404.76s]  40 minutes. You know what I'm saying?
[2404.76s -> 2409.24s]  You know what I mean? I wanna be real. I don't
[2409.24s -> 2411.24s]  want that. I don't want to be that.
[2411.24s -> 2413.24s]  I don't want this to turn into
[2413.24s -> 2415.24s]  that. I don't want to just collect money from you
[2415.24s -> 2418.76s]  and that's what I do.
[2418.76s -> 2423.37s]  Let me be real. Farming
[2423.37s -> 2432.52s]  subs. Where is German
[2432.52s -> 2436.23s]  land? It's coming soon.
[2436.23s -> 2438.66s]  That's like what just happened.
[2438.66s -> 2440.66s]  I turned the stream on to give you a couple of updates
[2440.66s -> 2442.66s]  and say have a good holiday.
[2442.66s -> 2444.66s]  If you celebrate Christmas, have a great Christmas. Whatever holiday
[2444.66s -> 2446.66s]  you're celebrating, happy holidays, right?
[2446.66s -> 2449.03s]  Merry Christmas to all that. Cause I'm not
[2449.03s -> 2451.53s]  gonna be here. I mean I just
[2451.53s -> 2453.53s]  got like a bunch of money.
[2453.53s -> 2455.53s]  Okay, I'm gonna update them and
[2455.53s -> 2457.53s]  yeah, I guess I'll collect
[2457.53s -> 2459.53s]  like fucking thousands of dollars.
[2459.53s -> 2462.02s]  You got crusty
[2462.02s -> 2467.32s]  lips? How about now?
[2467.32s -> 2473.46s]  Better? I know I have dry lips.
[2473.46s -> 2475.46s]  You know what? Fucking
[2475.46s -> 2477.46s]  mod that guy for five minutes and then
[2477.46s -> 2479.46s]  fucking throw his username
[2479.46s -> 2481.46s]  into the trash can
[2481.46s -> 2483.46s]  with all the other banned motherfuckers.
[2483.46s -> 2487.18s]  And then
[2487.18s -> 2491.14s]  throw him a life vest.
[2491.14s -> 2493.14s]  And take a huge smoke of
[2493.14s -> 2495.14s]  cigar.
[2497.90s -> 2500.20s]  Good luck getting back to land.
[2500.20s -> 2502.20s]  And then drop a briefcase
[2502.20s -> 2504.20s]  into the
[2504.20s -> 2506.20s]  huge briefcase into the fucking water.
[2506.20s -> 2508.20s]  And there's like 20 grand and hundreds in there.
[2508.20s -> 2520.68s]  Just fuck it up.
[2520.68s -> 2522.68s]  You know what I mean? Like wait, is he trying to kill me?
[2522.68s -> 2524.68s]  He's trying to give me money?
[2524.68s -> 2526.68s]  I don't understand what he's doing.
[2526.68s -> 2529.94s]  There's like a Lyft waiting for them?
[2529.94s -> 2534.04s]  Yeah, I'm taking you wherever you want to go.
[2534.04s -> 2538.50s]  Why? I don't know.
[2538.50s -> 2540.50s]  Mr. Green told me to do this.
[2540.50s -> 2542.50s]  I have no idea. He gave me $500
[2542.50s -> 2544.50s]  and said take him wherever he wants.
[2544.50s -> 2558.70s]  10k viewers? What would it look like
[2558.70s -> 2571.24s]  without lips? How do you do that?
[2571.24s -> 2577.83s]  Yeah. I can't get it to work.
[2577.83s -> 2581.16s]  Disgusting.
[2581.16s -> 2586.28s]  Oh, did you know that I was the Joker?
[2586.28s -> 2596.38s]  Stop. It was just Elmo.
[2596.38s -> 2599.19s]  The Joker kind of
[2599.19s -> 2603.22s]  is an Elmo laugh. It is.
[2603.22s -> 2605.22s]  You can't tell me that's not Elmo.
[2605.22s -> 2611.18s]  It's close.
[2611.18s -> 2613.18s]  It's in the line of
[2613.18s -> 2617.91s]  different Elmo laughs.
[2617.91s -> 2619.91s]  You don't go
[2619.91s -> 2621.91s]  hahahaha.
[2621.91s -> 2623.91s]  No. Who does a Joker laugh like that?
[2623.91s -> 2625.91s]  Everybody's Joker laugh is like extreme
[2625.91s -> 2627.91s]  and they throw their head
[2627.91s -> 2629.91s]  forward and they get a high pitch at the end.
[2629.91s -> 2634.71s]  It's Elmo.
[2634.71s -> 2636.71s]  Yeah, but that's different though.
[2636.71s -> 2643.24s]  Nobody does
[2643.24s -> 2645.24s]  the Joker laugh like
[2645.24s -> 2647.24s]  hahahaha. I am the Joker.
[2647.24s -> 2649.24s]  No. They all go
[2649.24s -> 2655.19s]  I don't know why we do that. Everyone does it
[2655.19s -> 2658.01s]  like that. Nobody does it the other way.
[2658.01s -> 2665.11s]  It was like 50 faces.
[2665.11s -> 2670.42s]  You need a Netflix special.
[2670.42s -> 2676.12s]  What the fuck would I even do?
[2676.12s -> 2678.12s]  You're going to be late? I'm not going to. I'm okay.
[2678.12s -> 2682.26s]  You got a link? Let's see.
[2682.26s -> 2684.76s]  Whole VTuber stream.
[2684.76s -> 2686.76s]  A VTuber face tracking program is not difficult
[2686.76s -> 2688.76s]  to get. Do it. What did you get? What is this?
[2688.76s -> 2696.38s]  Explain the toothbrush behind you.
[2696.38s -> 2708.39s]  Where? What?
[2708.39s -> 2714.79s]  There's your toothbrush. On the bottom shelf.
[2714.79s -> 2720.23s]  The fuck did you even see
[2720.23s -> 2722.79s]  that? How?
[2722.79s -> 2726.55s]  What? I don't know
[2726.55s -> 2728.55s]  why that's there. I have no idea.
[2728.55s -> 2737.32s]  I don't know why that's there.
[2737.32s -> 2739.32s]  I must have been
[2739.32s -> 2741.32s]  like, I don't know.
[2741.32s -> 2743.32s]  It must have been in my hand. I'm not a
[2743.32s -> 2745.32s]  weirdo. I promise. I don't know why there's a toothbrush
[2745.32s -> 2747.32s]  there. But I kind of need
[2747.32s -> 2749.32s]  it. So that's really good that
[2749.32s -> 2751.32s]  you saw that because I wouldn't have
[2751.32s -> 2754.39s]  seen it. It's in its case.
[2754.39s -> 2756.39s]  It's fine. I can't believe you saw that.
[2756.39s -> 2759.78s]  Explain it. I don't
[2759.78s -> 2762.02s]  know how to explain that.
[2762.02s -> 2766.70s]  How do you explain that? You don't.
[2766.70s -> 2768.70s]  Use it right now. No. I need it.
[2768.70s -> 2772.54s]  Brush your teeth. I do brush
[2772.54s -> 2774.54s]  my teeth. It's not right the second I'm
[2774.54s -> 2779.78s]  busy doing this. Unbox
[2779.78s -> 2785.42s]  it. No. That's
[2785.42s -> 2787.42s]  so fucking funny that somebody saw that.
[2787.42s -> 2789.59s]  Like, how?
[2789.59s -> 2791.59s]  People just like take every fucking
[2791.59s -> 2793.59s]  pixel and they go, what's over there?
[2793.59s -> 2795.59s]  What's over there? What's that thing right there? Is that
[2795.59s -> 2797.59s]  embarrassing? Let's find out. What's that?
[2797.59s -> 2799.59s]  Is that lotion? Is that lotion right here?
[2799.59s -> 2801.59s]  Jeremy, why do I have lotion? Why is there lotion there?
[2801.59s -> 2803.59s]  Are you zirking off? You must be zirking off.
[2803.59s -> 2805.59s]  Jeremy, why do I have lotion? Are you zirking off? You zirked off today.
[2805.59s -> 2808.02s]  No, I don't know why that's there. No, I know you
[2808.02s -> 2810.02s]  zirked off. I know it. I know it.
[2810.02s -> 2812.02s]  I know you did. You do. I know you do.
[2812.02s -> 2814.97s]  Okay, cool. Why is that?
[2814.97s -> 2816.97s]  What's in that box? The box behind you.
[2816.97s -> 2819.34s]  The box behind me? Yeah. What's it?
[2819.34s -> 2822.09s]  Was there lotion in there? Inside the box, like the cardboard box
[2822.09s -> 2824.09s]  over here. Yeah, you must have been zirking off in that box.
[2824.09s -> 2826.09s]  I don't zirk off in a box.
[2826.09s -> 2828.09s]  I don't. Yes, you do. Why is it behind you in your bedroom?
[2828.09s -> 2830.52s]  Because, I don't know, it's packing something.
[2830.52s -> 2832.52s]  Okay, yeah, right, there's lotion in there. You zirked off in that box. I know you did.
[2832.52s -> 2835.34s]  You fucking liar. I know you zirked off.
[2835.34s -> 2837.64s]  Everything has to do with that. You-
[2837.64s -> 2840.01s]  Why is the toothbrush there? What's the explanation
[2840.01s -> 2842.01s]  for that? I don't have one. You must be
[2842.01s -> 2844.01s]  fucking using that. On your butt.
[2844.01s -> 2846.01s]  You're like fucking butthole. No, I'm
[2846.01s -> 2848.01s]  not, actually. Oh, yeah? Yeah.
[2848.01s -> 2850.01s]  No, you zirked off and used that thing on your butthole.
[2850.01s -> 2852.57s]  I know you were. No, I'm not, okay?
[2852.57s -> 2860.44s]  Like, I'm not. It all
[2860.44s -> 2862.44s]  goes back to that every time.
[2862.44s -> 2866.66s]  No one said that? Oh, I'm sure
[2866.66s -> 2870.76s]  they did. You're projecting.
[2870.76s -> 2875.30s]  I thought there was a device-
[2875.30s -> 2879.21s]  Ow! I'm just saying,
[2879.21s -> 2881.64s]  it doesn't matter what's behind you,
[2881.64s -> 2883.64s]  if you're a YouTuber
[2883.64s -> 2885.88s]  or you're in a streamer room,
[2885.88s -> 2887.88s]  the thing that's not really supposed
[2887.88s -> 2890.38s]  to be in the room is
[2890.38s -> 2892.38s]  you must have been zirking off somehow.
[2892.38s -> 2908.17s]  It's every time.
[2908.17s -> 2910.17s]  Shut the door. This door is
[2910.17s -> 2914.01s]  shut. What are you talking about?
[2914.01s -> 2916.01s]  You're in a beatbox to meet the medic theme.
[2916.01s -> 2918.18s]  No, why?
[2918.18s -> 2920.87s]  I've done it like a thousand times.
[2920.87s -> 2922.87s]  Close it all the way. I will eventually
[2922.87s -> 2932.09s]  when I feel like it. Play with the
[2932.09s -> 2934.09s]  door spring to remove one million off the
[2934.09s -> 2937.03s]  dead. I already did. I did that already.
[2937.03s -> 2939.40s]  You missed it. I did that for free.
[2939.40s -> 2943.99s]  Alright. I gotta
[2943.99s -> 2945.99s]  get out of here. I have to leave.
[2945.99s -> 2947.99s]  I'm not gonna see you guys until next
[2947.99s -> 2950.42s]  week. Uh, probably like
[2950.42s -> 2952.73s]  I might- I might
[2952.73s -> 2954.73s]  even see you on New Year's
[2954.73s -> 2957.03s]  Eve. That might be the next time you physically
[2957.03s -> 2960.79s]  see me. Uh, I got a lot
[2960.79s -> 2962.79s]  of work to do. I've got a lot of stuff going on
[2962.79s -> 2964.79s]  and I'll be gone until
[2964.79s -> 2966.79s]  that week of New Year's Eve.
[2966.79s -> 2969.16s]  So, I didn't want- I wanted to stream
[2969.16s -> 2971.16s]  and I've been taking a lot of time off, I know
[2971.16s -> 2973.16s]  and that's why I feel even more like
[2973.16s -> 2975.16s]  just bad about taking
[2975.16s -> 2977.16s]  like thousands of subs
[2977.16s -> 2979.16s]  before it's like, well, see you later.
[2979.16s -> 2981.16s]  I'll see you like 12 days.
[2981.16s -> 2984.79s]  Um, but thanks
[2984.79s -> 2986.97s]  guys. We'll have fun on New Year's Eve.
[2986.97s -> 2988.97s]  A lot of festivities.
[2988.97s -> 2992.62s]  And, uh, I'll see you guys later.
[2992.62s -> 2995.29s]  We're not even gonna have an outro.
[2995.29s -> 2998.74s]  I'm just going. I'm just going.
[2998.74s -> 3000.74s]  No outro, no nothing. I didn't start with
[3000.74s -> 3007.34s]  one, I'm not gonna end with one.
[3007.34s -> 3009.83s]  Didn't start one, not gonna end with one.
[3009.83s -> 3011.83s]  Raid- Oh! You know who's live right now?
[3011.83s -> 3013.83s]  Who I never catch live because we're in different time
[3013.83s -> 3016.26s]  zones? Is, uh, RT.
[3016.26s -> 3019.08s]  RT Game Crowd's live right now.
[3019.08s -> 3021.08s]  Never catch him because we're just so far apart
[3021.08s -> 3023.32s]  in time zones.
[3023.32s -> 3027.42s]  So let's raid RT.
[3027.42s -> 3030.49s]  Absolutely. Okay.
[3030.49s -> 3032.49s]  Uh, I'll see you guys. I'll give you updates.
[3032.49s -> 3034.49s]  I'll be in the Discord. I'll be popping around.
[3034.49s -> 3037.10s]  Uh, but, I gotta make this really clear.
[3037.10s -> 3039.46s]  Make sure that you
[3039.46s -> 3041.46s]  keep an eye on the Discord over the next
[3041.46s -> 3043.46s]  like three or four days. Because the
[3043.46s -> 3045.46s]  poll, the voting of the actual awards
[3045.46s -> 3047.46s]  for your nominations that you've
[3047.46s -> 3049.46s]  nominated is gonna be there. I'll tweet
[3049.46s -> 3051.46s]  about it, it'll be in the Discord, but I'm not gonna be able to
[3051.46s -> 3054.15s]  talk about it until I'm back.
[3054.15s -> 3056.89s]  So, good night. Oh, well, it's like
[3056.89s -> 3059.26s]  no, it's like noon. Well, it's
[3059.26s -> 3061.26s]  noon somewhere. It's noon
[3061.26s -> 3063.88s]  somewhere, right? Whatever that thing is.
[3063.88s -> 3066.31s]  Yeah. I'll see you guys in like a week.
[3066.31s -> 3069.43s]  Take care of yourselves. Enjoy the rest of your
[3069.43s -> 3072.68s]  evening. Day, night, whatever.
[3072.68s -> 3076.20s]  It's noon here. It's noon here too. And I'll
[3076.20s -> 3078.20s]  see you guys soon. Happy holidays, Merry Christmas,
[3078.20s -> 3080.20s]  all that good stuff. Uh, take care
[3080.20s -> 3082.20s]  of yourselves, take care of your family, your loved ones, your friends,
[3082.20s -> 3084.20s]  uh, and enjoy the time
[3084.20s -> 3086.20s]  that you will have, uh, hopefully on like
[3086.20s -> 3088.20s]  Christmas and Christmas Eve and New Year's and stuff.
[3088.20s -> 3092.28s]  We're gonna have fun. Goodbye. Take care
[3092.28s -> 3094.84s]  of yourself. And, uh, let's go say hello to
[3094.84s -> 3100.06s]  RT. Goodbye. Gotta
[3100.06s -> 3103.64s]  go to the end slate here. Ow.
