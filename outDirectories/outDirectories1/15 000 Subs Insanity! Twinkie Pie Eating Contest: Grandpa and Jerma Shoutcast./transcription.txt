[0.31s -> 14.17s]  Hey, what's going on guys? Jerma here. I want to welcome you to the 15,000 subscriber.
[14.17s -> 20.66s]  I don't even know what you call this. This is not really a video. It's a video, but this is not a skit.
[20.66s -> 24.84s]  Really, it's more of a real life happening, I guess you could say.
[24.84s -> 28.84s]  We have Burger Boy who's standing right here. He's pretty much naked, so he can't like come into frame.
[28.84s -> 30.84s]  But I'll just say something. Say hello.
[32.59s -> 37.60s]  So what's going to happen in this video is there's going to be a Twinkie eating contest.
[37.60s -> 40.60s]  And then right after it, there's going to be a pie eating contest.
[40.60s -> 44.84s]  Both between Burger Boy and Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy.
[44.84s -> 48.84s]  So bear with us here. This is going to be pretty gross.
[48.84s -> 52.84s]  I won't recommend that you have like small children that are eating.
[52.84s -> 59.02s]  If you happen to be eating something, I would put it to the side for a second because this is disgusting.
[59.02s -> 63.02s]  So I hope you guys enjoy this. I'm going to be shout casting the whole thing.
[63.02s -> 65.19s]  So we'll see how it goes. See you in a second.
[68.31s -> 71.31s]  So welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the 15,000 subscriber video.
[71.31s -> 74.31s]  I am Anthony Wimbledon sitting alongside here with Grandpa.
[74.31s -> 76.31s]  We're going to go over the contestants for a little bit.
[76.31s -> 78.31s]  Grandpa, first introduce yourself.
[78.31s -> 81.31s]  I just want to say hello and welcome to the video.
[81.31s -> 84.31s]  This is going to be a crazy, extraordinary thing.
[84.31s -> 87.31s]  And these guys are gross, by the way. Can I just say that?
[87.31s -> 90.31s]  I think a lot of people potentially are thinking the same thing, Grandpa.
[90.31s -> 95.31s]  Okay, so first up here we have Burger Boy, who is a longtime champion of the eating events.
[95.31s -> 98.31s]  He holds seven world records for eating cheeseburgers.
[98.31s -> 101.31s]  And he is on the World Health Organization's list of potential threats.
[101.31s -> 103.31s]  Ladies and gentlemen, Burger Boy.
[103.31s -> 107.87s]  But we also have another competitor, Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy.
[107.87s -> 111.87s]  He has been doing a lot of trash talking prior to this competition.
[111.87s -> 115.87s]  All he wants to do is talk about Burger Boy and how fat he is and how stupid he is.
[115.87s -> 118.87s]  But we will see at the end of this competition if that's going to be true.
[118.87s -> 121.87s]  So let's get down to the floor here now. I guess I'm getting into my ear.
[121.87s -> 124.87s]  We're getting an interview here with Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy.
[124.87s -> 128.24s]  He's got something to say about Burger Boy. Let's get down there.
[128.24s -> 130.24s]  The Exoskeleton Bug body takes on the Burger Boy.
[130.24s -> 133.24s]  Here's how I'm going to win. The Burger Boy eats burgers, not Twinkies.
[133.24s -> 135.24s]  Boom. Shut down. Wasted.
[135.24s -> 138.24s]  He actually has quite a point there. Burger Boy looks a little stunned.
[138.24s -> 141.24s]  But what do you say we get this started, Grandpa? We're going to shell-cast this one, baby.
[141.24s -> 144.24s]  Get the countdown ready even though we're not going to keep any time.
[144.24s -> 146.24s]  That is really stupid.
[146.24s -> 148.24s]  But we're going to start this off right now. One to one right now.
[148.24s -> 152.24s]  Both of them shoving those down their throats. Burger Boy gets the upper hand with two now.
[152.24s -> 155.24s]  I mean, does this guy really think he's going to win this contest?
[155.24s -> 158.24s]  This guy's like ten times bigger than you. Are you fucking stupid?
[158.24s -> 159.24s]  Yep.
[159.24s -> 161.24s]  You can't win this. You're not going to win.
[161.24s -> 163.24s]  You are right though, Grandpa. He does have the weight advantage.
[163.24s -> 166.24s]  And he also has the eating advantage. He has multiple championships.
[166.24s -> 169.24s]  Millennium Boy has done pretty much absolutely nothing in his entire life.
[169.24s -> 171.24s]  So I can understand where you're coming from.
[171.24s -> 176.24s]  Also too, you'd really need to take into consideration the fact that the big fat guy over there...
[176.24s -> 177.24s]  Burger Boy, you mean? Yep.
[177.24s -> 183.24s]  Well, Burger Boy, he's a strong bastard. He could probably pick you up and throw you.
[183.24s -> 188.24s]  So even if he loses this fight tonight, he'll probably kick his ass.
[188.24s -> 190.24s]  And I'll probably want to watch that too.
[190.24s -> 192.24s]  And hopefully the cameraman gets that on camera.
[192.24s -> 194.24s]  That would be pretty interesting to say the least.
[194.24s -> 198.24s]  But right now, six to five. And Burger Boy seems to be losing his composure right now.
[198.24s -> 200.24s]  I thought what he just saw was really funny.
[200.24s -> 202.24s]  Actually, he's going to lose if he doesn't cut the shit.
[202.24s -> 206.24s]  Look at the inside of his mouth. That's disgusting.
[206.24s -> 209.24s]  Six to six now. Burger Boy trying to find his composure.
[209.24s -> 211.24s]  It is now tied up at the sixes.
[211.24s -> 213.24s]  Burger Boy now finds it. He gets one in there very quickly.
[213.24s -> 215.24s]  Now seven to six, Burger Boy.
[215.24s -> 218.48s]  And something that a lot of people don't understand is...
[218.48s -> 220.48s]  Twinkies are an incredibly dense snack.
[220.48s -> 224.48s]  150 calories per Twinkie and a ton of sugar.
[224.48s -> 226.48s]  Yet someone's definitely going to puke. Oh jeez.
[226.48s -> 231.48s]  If somebody doesn't puke, I will pay everybody six...
[231.48s -> 237.72s]  I will pay a dollar to charity if somebody doesn't puke.
[237.72s -> 239.72s]  Well, that's very noble of you, Grandpa. Very noble.
[239.72s -> 241.72s]  But it looks like we're starting to see a slowdown here.
[241.72s -> 244.72s]  Nine to seven. Oh, and listen to that.
[244.72s -> 246.72s]  He's got some choice words for him.
[246.72s -> 248.72s]  He's only up by one point though, trying to get a little overconfident there.
[248.72s -> 251.72s]  Yeah, he better watch that because I've done that before.
[251.72s -> 253.72s]  It came back to bite me right on the balls.
[253.72s -> 255.72s]  I said to some guy at the bus stop, I said,
[255.72s -> 258.72s]  Hey, can I see your newspaper for a second?
[258.72s -> 260.72s]  And he said, No, it's mine.
[260.72s -> 262.72s]  And then I got arrested for assault.
[262.72s -> 264.72s]  And I'm not sure where that was going.
[264.72s -> 266.72s]  But don't be mean to people.
[266.72s -> 268.72s]  That's the moral of the story.
[268.72s -> 269.72s]  Okay, that's fantastic.
[269.72s -> 270.72s]  But now we've got 11 to eight here.
[270.72s -> 272.72s]  Both of them slowing down immensely.
[272.72s -> 274.72s]  11 to nine now.
[274.72s -> 275.90s]  I think this is going to be the end here.
[275.90s -> 276.90s]  They're both stopping.
[276.90s -> 280.14s]  I don't see any more activity between either Burger Boy.
[280.14s -> 281.14s]  Let's go down to the field.
[281.14s -> 282.14s]  Let's find out what's going on down there.
[282.14s -> 285.14s]  The brick wall is there.
[285.14s -> 288.89s]  Heard it from Burger Boy himself hitting the brick wall.
[288.89s -> 290.89s]  Both of them are now conceding this match.
[290.89s -> 291.89s]  It is 11 to nine.
[291.89s -> 293.89s]  Burger Boy is your victor.
[293.89s -> 296.89s]  I mean, is that really a surprise to anybody that's watching this right now?
[296.89s -> 297.89s]  Probably not.
[297.89s -> 300.89s]  But let's go down to Jeremy, AKA me.
[300.89s -> 302.89s]  And I'll announce the winner.
[302.89s -> 308.54s]  So, ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the Twinkie eating competition,
[308.54s -> 310.97s]  Burger Boy.
[310.97s -> 314.96s]  What?
[314.96s -> 318.96s]  That's why I said you filmed it.
[318.96s -> 320.96s]  I didn't know you were going to do that either.
[320.96s -> 321.96s]  What did you just do?
[321.96s -> 322.96s]  I thought you were going to wait.
[322.96s -> 324.96s]  Wait, what?
[324.96s -> 326.96s]  So this is going to be just a bonus clip.
[326.96s -> 328.96s]  They decided to do a pie eating contest as well.
[328.96s -> 334.96s]  And as you can see here, they are both just disgusting human beings eating like a pig out of a trough.
[334.96s -> 336.96s]  And Burger Boy starts off very, very well.
[336.96s -> 338.96s]  But Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy does pretty well.
[338.96s -> 340.96s]  He keeps up pretty much the whole time.
[340.96s -> 342.96s]  We're going to go in for some live stuff in a second here.
[342.96s -> 347.96s]  But I just want to take this opportunity to thank every single person that has subscribed to the channel.
[347.96s -> 351.96s]  15,000 subscribers is mind boggling, guys.
[351.96s -> 353.96s]  So thank you all so, so much.
[353.96s -> 354.96s]  It means a hell of a lot to me.
[354.96s -> 356.96s]  You guys rock everybody.
[356.96s -> 358.96s]  So take care, guys.
[358.96s -> 359.96s]  I'll see you all soon.
[359.96s -> 361.96s]  And I'll leave you with the ending.
[361.96s -> 362.96s]  It was pretty funny.
[362.96s -> 365.96s]  So here's the ending of the pie eating contest.
[365.96s -> 367.96s]  Take care, everybody.
[367.96s -> 371.80s]  The crust is like stuck to the bottom.
[371.80s -> 372.98s]  Scrape it.
[372.98s -> 374.98s]  Scrape it?
[374.98s -> 378.21s]  Scrape it.
[378.21s -> 380.21s]  Scrape it.
[380.21s -> 381.21s]  Oh, fuck.
[381.21s -> 382.21s]  What is this stuff?
[386.38s -> 387.38s]  Oh, man.
[387.38s -> 394.49s]  Your winner, again, Burger Boy.
[396.24s -> 402.10s]  Oh, I won a pie eating contest when I was like a kid.
[402.10s -> 404.10s]  At like summer camp.
[404.10s -> 406.10s]  Everyone was like, oh, I didn't eat all day.
[406.10s -> 407.10s]  Even like, oh, the fat kids.
[407.10s -> 409.10s]  And then, oh, I won.
[409.10s -> 410.10s]  I beat them all.
[410.10s -> 411.10s]  I was like a little guy.
[411.10s -> 413.10s]  Oh, what happened now?
[413.10s -> 414.10s]  You lost.
