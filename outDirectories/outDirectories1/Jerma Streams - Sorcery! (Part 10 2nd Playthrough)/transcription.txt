[23.27s -> 28.87s]  Hey, what's up? What's happening? How's it going?
[30.91s -> 37.22s]  Hope you're enjoying your long weekend here. Not over yet.
[44.63s -> 50.33s]  Tonight, tonight going to be playing a sorcery part four pick up right where we
[50.33s -> 57.10s]  left off. Sorcery council. It should be here. It is,
[58.46s -> 65.06s]  it is nine people. So we got to make sure they're here. By the way,
[65.06s -> 71.26s]  the sorcery council changes every week. I don't even know who's on it anymore.
[77.54s -> 79.42s]  Sorcery squad. There's one, there's one.
[81.16s -> 88.96s]  There's one of the council members right there. Okay. Did you ever know? No.
[93.97s -> 101.68s]  All right. Are you guys ready? Is ready to get back into sorcery.
[102.52s -> 105.73s]  I think there's probably going to be another, I am.
[105.73s -> 107.49s]  I'm trying to think of how long this took last time.
[109.88s -> 114.75s]  We've done one three, four hours stream in part four.
[115.86s -> 119.74s]  I think it's about 15 ish, 17 ish hours,
[125.63s -> 128.59s]  which is removing the moments feature. Yeah.
[130.73s -> 132.93s]  We didn't really care too much about them here. Anyways,
[133.81s -> 137.37s]  aren't half of the moments on this channel, just complete fucking nonsense.
[139.45s -> 142.53s]  I think I specifically did like seven in a row. That just meant nothing.
[145.37s -> 150.98s]  My accolades. We cared. I cared. Oh, remember we cared. Oh,
[153.65s -> 157.29s]  I just, I'm sorry. Tell me how you really feel.
[159.80s -> 161.64s]  All, all seven. Oh my God.
[163.51s -> 167.11s]  They're kind of a pain to get right since you had to fit a moment in a 60 second
[167.11s -> 171.73s]  clip. I don't think there was anything wrong with them. It's a cool idea,
[172.53s -> 176.09s]  but I, I didn't really, I mean, mods would use it sometimes.
[176.49s -> 178.33s]  I did that one time last year.
[178.33s -> 182.37s]  I just removed them all for the month because that was funny. Oh, whatever.
[183.17s -> 190.82s]  Apparently that's going away. I, that's new news to me, bro.
[190.82s -> 194.66s]  Stop distracting me. I'm writing a research paper. Devil spawn.
[197.22s -> 213.74s]  What are you writing your paper about? Devil spawn? That's your question.
[214.83s -> 219.14s]  I mean like, well, how about this? Go do your homework. What do you go?
[219.14s -> 228.22s]  Do your paper? I only watch clip compilations.
[228.22s -> 232.98s]  When do you start being funny? Uh, never again. I'm officially retired.
[232.98s -> 237.66s]  So, um, literally never again. So sorry. You probably have to find some,
[237.94s -> 242.72s]  you're probably gonna have to find it somewhere else. I'm never gonna,
[242.72s -> 256.45s]  I'm never gonna make a joke ever again. Ever. I still got it.
[257.99s -> 258.91s]  I still got it.
[261.09s -> 264.85s]  And that person for even questioning if I would make a funny noise,
[265.87s -> 270.69s]  I know that's not what they said, but I don't care. All right. You guys ready?
[279.38s -> 284.95s]  My mother got food poisoning. How do I help? Okay. First of all,
[285.55s -> 290.82s]  sorry to hear that. Second of all, just if your mother yells down,
[290.82s -> 295.25s]  I need a Gatorade. You go get the fucking Gatorade. You understand?
[298.98s -> 312.87s]  You go get it. Did you see the hard drive article? I did very recently.
[312.87s -> 315.95s]  Like that was the one that was the last thing that I saw before turning the
[315.95s -> 322.14s]  stream on. It was like, Hey, did you see this? I was like, Oh,
[322.22s -> 329.98s]  I guess yeah. Yeah, I guess so. I, okay. I don't, I'll tell you, I don't,
[329.98s -> 335.16s]  I try not to pay that much attention to many things because I'm,
[335.92s -> 339.88s]  I told you I'm very disconnected from social media. So sometimes I'll just hear,
[340.52s -> 344.72s]  Hey dude, look at this. Do you see this picture of your face? I,
[346.00s -> 351.94s]  I guess what's the context of this picture? So that's cool though.
[352.26s -> 357.81s]  That's fun. I mean, there are things that I, you know, I,
[358.21s -> 361.85s]  what was written about me, you know, my accolades. That's cool with me.
[362.73s -> 365.41s]  You're going to write about my accolades then. Absolutely. I'd love to read it.
[368.48s -> 383.94s]  Somebody said it good. Humble brag. Do you feel like a celebrity?
[385.98s -> 389.58s]  No, no. I don't fucking want to be a celebrity. No,
[389.66s -> 393.78s]  that's we're not going to use that language. I am an E clown and that's it.
[394.85s -> 399.13s]  I am a certified E clown with my own certification. I certified myself.
[402.60s -> 408.17s]  Don't call me that. Call me an E clown. But no, I mean, it's a bit,
[408.17s -> 409.01s]  I guess it depends.
[410.58s -> 413.98s]  I try to stay grounded because I don't want to think of myself that way because
[413.98s -> 420.80s]  then it's like, Mr. Celebrity, look at me. No, don't.
[420.80s -> 427.78s]  I just make jokes on the internet sometimes. All right, you guys good.
[427.82s -> 435.83s]  Let's go. They picked the worst picture for that article.
[435.83s -> 439.06s]  You look deranged in it. Guys,
[439.06s -> 443.76s]  there are no pictures of me where I don't look like that. Do you understand?
[444.24s -> 448.48s]  I have never in 13 years straight,
[449.12s -> 454.12s]  I have never gotten in front of a camera that was taking still photography to
[456.57s -> 461.63s]  use anywhere like, Oh, Hey, of course I had to get my headshots.
[463.02s -> 464.34s]  I had to get my pictures taken.
[465.43s -> 470.23s]  Every picture of me on the internet is of me sitting in a chair with a blown up
[470.23s -> 472.47s]  webcam image. Cause it's always at the bottom of the screen,
[472.47s -> 475.59s]  or it's running at such a shit bit rate that even when it is blown up,
[475.59s -> 482.32s]  it looks terrible. I've never taken like real professional headshots.
[491.26s -> 491.90s]  The dollhouse. Yeah.
[491.90s -> 496.90s]  The reason why people use that dollhouse image from like the red sex thing is
[497.50s -> 502.50s]  because that's probably one of the only front facing pictures I have of myself.
[504.44s -> 507.16s]  That's the only one where the angle is correct for my face.
[508.54s -> 520.82s]  All the other ones are just weird. Taken from a webcam. Stop stalling. Hey,
[521.42s -> 532.80s]  I'm going to stall as long as I want. Your stream, your stream is too high quality.
[532.80s -> 538.86s]  No, it's not stalled more. But it's funny that, uh,
[538.90s -> 541.94s]  we've all seen the picture of me leaning back with my mouth open and my teeth
[541.94s -> 546.46s]  showing that's used a lot. It's funny. Like, Oh, Hey, what do you think? Hey,
[546.46s -> 550.26s]  here's a picture of Jerma that we're going to use the one where he's leaning
[550.26s -> 554.26s]  back with his mouth open and his teeth out and his mouth is just open sitting
[554.26s -> 561.18s]  back in a chair. But who cares? I don't care.
[561.50s -> 566.41s]  If I cared I would have gotten pictures taken a long, long time ago. Which one?
[566.41s -> 568.93s]  You know, the one, it's the one where I'm leaning. My mouth is open.
[568.93s -> 572.89s]  My teeth are kind of showing and my head's tilted. My teeth are,
[573.17s -> 577.72s]  my front teeth are showing you. It's you guys know which one, cause there's three.
[578.48s -> 587.77s]  There were three pictures of me. It's it's two. But anyways, you guys, right?
[588.62s -> 598.98s]  Let's go. We literally don't know the picture. You do.
[599.96s -> 606.70s]  You know, you know, the picture. Okay. You ready? What's he talking about?
[606.74s -> 608.82s]  Uh, you kind of, you need to know. We're talking about,
[608.82s -> 610.98s]  there was an article that was written about me. It was a jokey article.
[610.98s -> 615.80s]  It was funny. It was on hard drive. They're funny. And, uh, yeah,
[615.80s -> 620.75s]  you, the mods got it and we were just talking about it for a few seconds.
[623.98s -> 626.58s]  They got your job wrong. They said digital clown.
[630.73s -> 638.03s]  It's not accurate. Okay, let's go. That was an 11 minute stall.
[639.35s -> 642.11s]  No, that's it. That's amateur hour. That is nothing.
[644.38s -> 651.31s]  I've stalled for like 40 minutes before. That's nothing. That's nothing. Okay,
[651.31s -> 657.07s]  here we go. Uh, TLDR. Hope you're having a good weekend. Hope you're, uh,
[658.53s -> 662.37s]  let's go. I'm going to go. All right. You emerged from the alley into the,
[662.49s -> 663.61s]  why did I need to stop to do that?
[664.46s -> 666.62s]  You emerged from the alley into the edge of the main square.
[666.66s -> 673.72s]  What happened last episode? Everybody. We got into,
[675.00s -> 679.91s]  uh, we made it into Isamu. We made it into Manpang.
[681.15s -> 686.22s]  We are now at the steps of the fortress of the Archmage.
[688.29s -> 690.78s]  Such a teacher question. Yeah.
[690.78s -> 695.14s]  I just told you guys to open up your textbooks. So where do we leave off? Okay.
[697.38s -> 698.78s]  In my sorcery playthrough,
[701.77s -> 704.45s]  would you guys have a lot more fun in school if you had homework based on these
[704.45s -> 707.98s]  streams?
[707.98s -> 711.66s]  You had to come back with like a worksheet filled out of what we did today.
[713.90s -> 716.05s]  I feel like that wouldn't be awful. All right,
[716.05s -> 716.89s]  I'm going to go right into the square.
[720.65s -> 726.90s]  You would be getting a very poor education if you did, if that happened. All right.
[726.90s -> 729.22s]  The air moves a little around you still icy, but fresh.
[729.82s -> 732.98s]  You stride out into the middle of the public square where Manpang's inhabitants
[732.98s -> 733.90s]  go about their business.
[735.07s -> 739.03s]  In the center is a huge statue of a faceless man holding a crown aloft.
[739.76s -> 753.05s]  The Archmage. Let's look at it. Look around.
[754.09s -> 755.61s]  Many people here are simply passing through,
[755.61s -> 757.81s]  but several are browsing the market on the West side.
[758.29s -> 762.53s]  You also spot several guards to the North clustered around a road that leads
[762.61s -> 766.64s]  upwards. And look at the statue.
[768.25s -> 772.73s]  The statue seems unimaginably old and yet the Archmage depicted
[773.13s -> 775.37s]  here is definitely holding the crown of Kings.
[776.37s -> 778.85s]  Has he been planning this theft for such a long time then?
[779.41s -> 782.81s]  Or is this prophecy a celebration of a day destined to come?
[786.82s -> 796.80s]  I forget what you can do here. Should I give the statue depression?
[803.72s -> 810.65s]  The statue is not an animal. I don't think we can talk to it. Zap it?
[811.89s -> 815.46s]  I don't think that's a good idea either. Can I read the statue's mind?
[823.18s -> 825.22s]  Drawing the skull cap from your pack, you cast a spell.
[825.74s -> 828.66s]  From all around the square come a multitude of, oh, it's everybody.
[829.42s -> 833.14s]  A multitude of thoughts. You concentrate to pick one out.
[834.22s -> 836.06s]  A nearby monk is shaking with fear.
[837.61s -> 842.17s]  Those red eyes, they are God fearing, but I fear them.
[843.44s -> 844.52s]  Remove the cap once more.
[845.33s -> 847.65s]  There are guards patrolling more frequently even here.
[848.54s -> 851.86s]  They're patrolling frequently even here. You'll have to be careful to blend in.
[865.90s -> 869.46s]  I think it's just sus. That's the easy, that we're doing sus. Come on.
[872.50s -> 874.22s]  You turn the starlight into alignment around you.
[874.22s -> 876.38s]  A calm voice speaks into your thoughts.
[877.19s -> 881.35s]  You receive a strong feeling of trepidation about the alley to the East.
[882.03s -> 886.07s]  Being so near the gates means there is a greater number of merchants and
[886.07s -> 888.71s]  travelers here. The further into the keep you go,
[889.19s -> 891.59s]  the inhabitants will become increasingly wary of outsiders.
[898.00s -> 900.52s]  Maybe I can't really do anything with it. What if I go, what can I make?
[900.52s -> 907.68s]  Can I just make a move? Oh shit. All right. Now this is important. All right.
[907.68s -> 911.33s]  Where are we going? Remember, I don't have any rewinds.
[912.58s -> 918.59s]  So this is important. I don't know if I want to put all these on a pole,
[919.64s -> 921.48s]  but I'm going to pick out a few.
[924.14s -> 927.98s]  I'm going to pick out archway. So in here, this building here,
[929.38s -> 932.37s]  I'm going to pick out North side.
[933.82s -> 938.01s]  So archway North or the market.
[939.77s -> 942.65s]  So we're going to go up North, which goes up here.
[944.78s -> 949.30s]  East goes into this archway or West to the market. We can get a pole.
[949.34s -> 958.73s]  One of the moderators can do that. Please. It would be awesome. Uh, okay.
[959.95s -> 964.06s]  Markets are always fun. They are always fun. But what's in this building?
[966.91s -> 974.98s]  I got a raspberry tea tonight. Anybody was keeping score. It's good.
[979.26s -> 986.74s]  Go to the bathroom. I already did. Why would you? Okay.
[988.21s -> 993.81s]  Oh, what are the pole? Uh, the options are North archway or market.
[994.99s -> 998.32s]  A lot of decisions to make. Go pee. I, I,
[999.08s -> 1004.75s]  I try to go empty my bladder and other areas before stream because I don't want
[1005.95s -> 1008.63s]  to have to get up. I want to be able to sit here for at least an hour or two.
[1014.05s -> 1018.92s]  Why did you phrase it like that? I don't know. Because people are weird.
[1024.50s -> 1025.26s]  Because if I said, well,
[1025.26s -> 1029.58s]  you see what I do before every stream is I take the shit and I empty my fuck.
[1029.58s -> 1032.94s]  I piss. Someone would be like, Oh, he said these words. I'm going to clip it.
[1033.50s -> 1043.03s]  He shit his pants. He said he shit his pants today. That's a lot more normal.
[1046.89s -> 1052.93s]  Hey, thanks for the clip. Yeah, you're welcome. Paranoid.
[1054.77s -> 1065.46s]  I mean, I'm fucking around. All right, where are we going? Market. Okay,
[1066.22s -> 1073.38s]  let's go. The market is busy with traders and stalls, a city in miniature.
[1074.03s -> 1077.11s]  The market is not as large as those you encountered in Kare,
[1077.59s -> 1080.35s]  but still it bustles with life. Even in Mampang,
[1080.39s -> 1088.02s]  people need to go about their day. All right, let's go to the stalls.
[1091.79s -> 1096.27s]  Most of the stalls are mundane, roughly made household goods in some trinkets.
[1096.87s -> 1100.39s]  Despite the number of shoppers, there are in fact very few goods,
[1101.23s -> 1103.07s]  but as you wander the stalls, the stands,
[1103.92s -> 1105.92s]  you do spot a weapons dealer,
[1105.92s -> 1111.04s]  flaunting his wares and a bent backed peddler with unusual items spread on a
[1111.04s -> 1116.45s]  cloth. All right. Weapons dealer or the peddler.
[1116.89s -> 1123.88s]  I have a bunch of really great, I have great weapons right now at the trinkets.
[1123.92s -> 1130.75s]  Oh my God. That's what I was thinking. He's just chill.
[1132.77s -> 1136.97s]  The peddler smiles as you approach any gestures across a motley collection of
[1136.97s -> 1140.29s]  objects laid out on a blanket, this chipped pottery,
[1140.65s -> 1145.09s]  dull knives and an empty picture frame. The man is not old,
[1145.25s -> 1151.33s]  but a hard life has aged his looks. Junk, refuse,
[1151.33s -> 1157.74s]  memorabilia, all for the discerning customer. Where are you from?
[1158.94s -> 1163.38s]  Shores of Lake Eklalala originally, but that was long ago.
[1163.98s -> 1166.58s]  I took to wandering at a young age and finished up here.
[1167.94s -> 1176.70s]  Not what I hoped for really. Oh, I can sell stuff. Should I sell the gems?
[1178.28s -> 1181.06s]  Why are you selling junk? He cackles,
[1181.06s -> 1187.75s]  which ends in a tremendous coughing fit. Oh,
[1187.75s -> 1189.95s]  you know another person's treasure, right?
[1197.88s -> 1203.31s]  Some of these can be used for magic. I am no sorcerer,
[1203.31s -> 1206.57s]  just a man with a good eye for value. I've learned.
[1206.97s -> 1210.25s]  There are those out there who know a worthy purchase when they see it.
[1216.94s -> 1220.26s]  How did you come across these things? He points to a dried flower.
[1221.17s -> 1223.81s]  That I found in the back pocket of a sleeping werewolf.
[1224.33s -> 1228.97s]  This clue I won from a man in a contest of riddles. And this mirror,
[1229.21s -> 1232.13s]  I found dangling from a tree in an ancient swamp.
[1233.94s -> 1238.00s]  You are quite the adventurer. In my youth, I was many things.
[1238.00s -> 1239.44s]  An excellent dancer, for instance.
[1239.96s -> 1243.52s]  I fathered 47 children by that particular skill.
[1244.95s -> 1252.35s]  He scratches his nose. You're going to buy anything? 47 children. Okay.
[1254.39s -> 1256.23s]  Scrutinizing his assortment of junk.
[1256.27s -> 1258.47s]  You can see few items that would be useful to you.
[1259.95s -> 1262.99s]  47 children by being a good dancer.
[1268.20s -> 1276.14s]  Somebody said it, right? Yep. Somebody said puzzler.
[1277.66s -> 1284.03s]  The puzzler. In every state, in every country.
[1286.68s -> 1297.35s]  Um, what do I need? I kind of have everything I need,
[1298.74s -> 1300.40s]  but maybe the mirror.
[1308.96s -> 1312.12s]  You pick up the gold backed mirror and admire yourself in it.
[1312.85s -> 1317.07s]  The peddler smiles and hands over the mirror. It still may smell of swamp.
[1317.63s -> 1322.57s]  It's 48 gold pieces. It is too expensive. You replace it on the rug.
[1324.42s -> 1325.46s]  That is way too expensive.
[1327.17s -> 1332.24s]  Why do I have to pay the amount of children he has in gold pieces?
[1333.51s -> 1343.67s]  That's weird. What about the gems? Do you buy as well? I have gems for sale.
[1344.44s -> 1348.68s]  Gems? No, no point in me buying gems.
[1349.28s -> 1351.72s]  What would happen if I put them out on my rug here, do you think?
[1352.36s -> 1358.34s]  Would I make my money back? I don't think so. Who might take them?
[1359.88s -> 1362.80s]  Try Hummingbird, the weapons dealer. He's nuts.
[1363.52s -> 1369.16s]  He waves at his wares again. His previous grin returning. Okay.
[1371.27s -> 1383.93s]  Um, so that, this is kind of unfortunate. Limberry potion.
[1384.77s -> 1387.69s]  You lift the vial of potion carefully. Fresh, the peddler says.
[1388.01s -> 1393.60s]  Oh, fresh enough anyway. Yours for 30 gold. Yeah. What is going on here?
[1394.20s -> 1397.15s]  Why so much? You inquire. He shrugs.
[1397.81s -> 1403.44s]  You seen any blimberries around here? You put it back. Okay.
[1403.44s -> 1409.62s]  But this is all going to be too expensive. Yeah. A giant's tooth for 39 gold for
[1409.62s -> 1417.14s]  one giant's tooth. No. What about the glue?
[1418.53s -> 1422.05s]  Have a lot of spilling. Peddler says, as you lift the vial of glue,
[1422.45s -> 1428.42s]  it's 24 gold pieces. You smile weakly. You put it back down on the mat.
[1429.46s -> 1432.66s]  You decide to take your leave. The peddler wishes you safe travels with a wink.
[1435.22s -> 1439.95s]  Okay. Well that guy was not very helpful. The mirror probably was worth it,
[1439.95s -> 1445.30s]  but let's go sell our gems. You approach the weapon stall.
[1445.38s -> 1449.74s]  The trader is extraordinarily thin. He might disappear if he turned sideways.
[1451.03s -> 1454.75s]  Welcome friend. The army has procured most of my goods,
[1455.07s -> 1457.91s]  but I have a few items left to sell for my original stock.
[1461.31s -> 1466.52s]  You buy gemstones? I might, may I see? Perhaps a trade in kind.
[1470.74s -> 1477.09s]  Is he going to run if I give these to him? Gems for a sword.
[1481.66s -> 1486.86s]  I might let him see them. Gems for a sword, you ask? How about this?
[1487.22s -> 1491.70s]  He lifts a cutlass from the mat. It really is my finest blade. Strong,
[1491.70s -> 1495.64s]  supple perfection. Where did you get it?
[1496.81s -> 1501.37s]  It washed up in the fountain of the merchant's yard. To my very great surprise,
[1501.69s -> 1503.13s]  the fountains are fed by rivers.
[1503.61s -> 1507.81s]  I suppose something must have sunk somewhere once upon a time.
[1508.29s -> 1514.16s]  Or else someone dropped it there by accident. Is that any good though?
[1518.23s -> 1526.02s]  I don't think I'm doing this. He stole it off a corpse. I mean,
[1526.02s -> 1529.30s]  it is episode four. We don't have very many other places to spend this stuff.
[1530.08s -> 1534.28s]  We are at the last episode, so can't take it with us.
[1536.82s -> 1540.32s]  So I don't know if there's another opportunity to get rid of these gems.
[1540.32s -> 1545.38s]  There might be, I don't remember. Stop buying so many swords.
[1545.38s -> 1550.44s]  You're like Finn, but worse. I do have a lot of weapons. That's true.
[1550.68s -> 1553.60s]  How many do we have? All right. If we have more than three, I won't buy it.
[1555.78s -> 1560.06s]  One sword, one long sword, one assassin's sword,
[1560.14s -> 1564.66s]  one blessed hardwood spear, one chopping knife, one hefty arrow,
[1564.70s -> 1567.78s]  one hewing axe, one chakram, and a silver chain.
[1570.45s -> 1577.96s]  This is more than three. This is way more than three. There's a lot of weapons.
[1578.00s -> 1579.84s]  You're right. You're right. You're right. Okay. All right. You're right.
[1579.84s -> 1583.03s]  You're right. You're right. You're right. Okay. Don't buy the sword.
[1583.47s -> 1588.09s]  I don't want it. It's not what I want. You shake your head.
[1589.37s -> 1591.13s]  That's the best blade I have.
[1592.39s -> 1596.99s]  And I don't have enough gold on me to buy them outright. Sorry, friend.
[1597.90s -> 1603.14s]  No deal. What do you have? Is everything besides weapons?
[1603.70s -> 1607.16s]  But it is the weapons dealer. What do you have?
[1608.24s -> 1609.56s]  I can see you're a seasoned one,
[1609.60s -> 1613.04s]  so I won't waste your time with the lumps the common soldier gets stuck with.
[1613.66s -> 1617.10s]  I have this broad sword, which I can let go for, say,
[1617.50s -> 1619.54s]  15 gold pieces.
[1620.32s -> 1624.24s]  And the best sword in my possession is this cutlass for 600 gold pieces.
[1625.00s -> 1627.68s]  Of course, at these prices, you are practically robbing me,
[1627.68s -> 1632.04s]  but then so has everyone else in this place. 600 gold.
[1637.59s -> 1640.94s]  It was a plus six cutlass. What?
[1643.45s -> 1648.85s]  Your prices are too expensive. He shakes his head.
[1649.65s -> 1651.81s]  This is the best you'll find in this fortress.
[1652.21s -> 1656.73s]  I am nearly destitute thanks to Nighlok. I cannot go any lower.
[1659.65s -> 1662.21s]  But 600 gold pieces.
[1665.04s -> 1667.08s]  Somebody said go back. There is no going back.
[1667.52s -> 1669.54s]  There are no more rewinds.
[1669.54s -> 1673.41s]  We have to live with whatever happens here.
[1673.41s -> 1675.29s]  This is no ordinary cutlass.
[1675.29s -> 1677.45s]  The edge is unbreakable. The weight is perfect.
[1677.85s -> 1680.29s]  The blade cannot be dropped or slipped from the hand.
[1680.29s -> 1681.65s]  It cannot miss.
[1681.65s -> 1683.89s]  This blade will make you all but invincible.
[1685.22s -> 1688.06s]  Oh, spit in my... It's pretty good, see?
[1690.52s -> 1692.52s]  He pauses to wipe spit from his mouth.
[1692.52s -> 1695.74s]  That's such a gross sentence.
[1695.74s -> 1698.54s]  Give me a better deal.
[1698.54s -> 1702.14s]  Friend, this morning, a beast man was so upset about the price
[1702.14s -> 1704.98s]  he threatened me with the very sword I was trying to sell him.
[1705.74s -> 1708.82s]  I can see you have a lot to learn about haggling in Mampang.
[1710.03s -> 1711.31s]  You've seen enough.
[1711.31s -> 1713.66s]  You nod to the trader.
[1713.66s -> 1716.34s]  Are you not from Mampang?
[1716.34s -> 1718.66s]  There are safer trade routes. Yes, I know.
[1719.34s -> 1722.74s]  But as a bold young man, I heard that the archmage was offering
[1722.74s -> 1724.82s]  a fortune for weapons.
[1724.82s -> 1726.90s]  The trader waves his hand vaguely,
[1726.90s -> 1729.06s]  outfitting a new army or something.
[1729.06s -> 1730.70s]  I am not so sure.
[1730.70s -> 1733.06s]  Of course, once I got here.
[1733.06s -> 1736.58s]  Well, hmm.
[1736.58s -> 1738.47s]  What happened?
[1738.47s -> 1740.91s]  He glances at a passing guard and lowers his voice.
[1742.38s -> 1745.26s]  That snake Nylok would only pay me half
[1745.90s -> 1747.94s]  and left me stuck on the wrong side of the wall.
[1748.62s -> 1749.78s]  But what could I do?
[1749.78s -> 1753.70s]  If I tried to leave, some bird man would have no doubt swooped down and...
[1754.88s -> 1756.93s]  Quiet?
[1756.93s -> 1758.17s]  Swooped down.
[1758.17s -> 1760.23s]  And that would have been the end of it.
[1760.23s -> 1762.47s]  At least I'm in a state to appreciate my poverty.
[1763.03s -> 1768.35s]  But what can I do for you?
[1768.35s -> 1770.16s]  Nylok.
[1770.16s -> 1771.64s]  He makes a rude noise.
[1771.64s -> 1772.52s]  Bleh!
[1772.52s -> 1774.44s]  The archmage is official merchant.
[1774.44s -> 1776.72s]  She handles all the trade for Mampang.
[1776.72s -> 1777.96s]  Not us.
[1777.96s -> 1779.94s]  And he gestures to the crowds.
[1779.94s -> 1783.30s]  But the fortress, the guard encampment around the tower.
[1783.30s -> 1786.78s]  I suppose she's now chiefly interested in outfitting the army.
[1788.64s -> 1789.88s]  An army?
[1789.88s -> 1791.16s]  Oh, oh, indeed.
[1791.16s -> 1793.92s]  Though I couldn't tell you who they're supposed to be fighting.
[1794.56s -> 1796.96s]  Everyone outside the walls is now dead.
[1796.96s -> 1798.36s]  Or so they say.
[1798.40s -> 1801.68s]  Now, are you going to buy something or are we to simply chatter like
[1802.04s -> 1803.80s]  a clatter man's grandmother?
[1803.80s -> 1808.59s]  Farewell.
[1808.59s -> 1813.06s]  Farewell, then do come back.
[1813.06s -> 1814.22s]  Everyone is dead.
[1814.22s -> 1818.22s]  Oh, no.
[1818.22s -> 1820.86s]  Is it getting close to your Sheldon impression?
[1823.35s -> 1827.47s]  Well, my my my siblings were very interesting people.
[1828.11s -> 1831.11s]  My sister at dinner one time.
[1831.63s -> 1839.14s]  Oh, shit. It is.
[1839.14s -> 1846.90s]  All right, let's go to the tents.
[1847.34s -> 1848.02s]  Hold on.
[1848.02s -> 1850.30s]  How close to Bugleberry is my Sheldon?
[1851.26s -> 1853.29s]  There was a time.
[1853.29s -> 1855.41s]  My sister, my sister.
[1856.67s -> 1857.67s]  There was a time.
[1857.67s -> 1866.14s]  There was there was a time.
[1866.14s -> 1867.94s]  Or is it just the Joker?
[1867.94s -> 1874.65s]  You'll never know.
[1874.65s -> 1875.73s]  Omegalul stop.
[1875.73s -> 1877.93s]  You can't write that and then say stop.
[1877.93s -> 1878.17s]  All right.
[1878.17s -> 1881.65s]  There are a few large tents set up some and some stone buildings, too.
[1883.60s -> 1887.24s]  There's a hawker loudly proclaiming that mysteries and wonders
[1887.24s -> 1889.03s]  await in his tent.
[1889.03s -> 1892.63s]  In one corner, a long line of creatures queue outside of a low stone building.
[1895.96s -> 1898.32s]  Fortune teller, the hawker.
[1898.32s -> 1899.84s]  We were already here.
[1899.84s -> 1907.18s]  Maybe I should just get a weapon.
[1907.18s -> 1909.56s]  Fortune teller.
[1909.56s -> 1910.44s]  We need food.
[1910.44s -> 1915.80s]  Yes, we do.
[1915.80s -> 1919.63s]  Let's go to fortune teller.
[1919.63s -> 1920.67s]  I love that, by the way, though.
[1923.10s -> 1925.60s]  I'm not sure if you could hear it.
[1925.60s -> 1928.24s]  You join a long line of creatures outside the low stone
[1928.24s -> 1930.04s]  building of the fortune teller.
[1930.04s -> 1934.01s]  They're waiting with surprising patience.
[1934.01s -> 1936.38s]  Let's talk to the creature ahead of me.
[1936.38s -> 1939.78s]  The creature in front of you is a hobgoblin with long blonde hair
[1939.78s -> 1941.98s]  and two protruding hooked teeth.
[1945.70s -> 1947.14s]  Why is everyone waiting?
[1947.14s -> 1949.58s]  You ask?
[1949.58s -> 1951.60s]  You don't know.
[1951.60s -> 1953.84s]  Why are you waiting here if you don't know?
[1954.24s -> 1958.49s]  I saw the line.
[1958.49s -> 1960.45s]  So you just joined?
[1960.45s -> 1965.72s]  Well, I suppose when I first joined the line, it was for the same reason.
[1966.57s -> 1970.94s]  But it seems so long ago now.
[1970.94s -> 1973.07s]  How long have you been waiting?
[1973.07s -> 1974.55s]  This time?
[1974.55s -> 1977.95s]  A few hours, maybe.
[1977.95s -> 1980.39s]  What do you mean this time?
[1980.39s -> 1982.55s]  Well, this isn't my first visit.
[1983.23s -> 1985.59s]  No one visits wide only once.
[1987.75s -> 1990.17s]  Did you say wide?
[1990.17s -> 1991.45s]  That's right.
[1991.45s -> 1993.05s]  Fair and wide.
[1993.05s -> 1995.57s]  The great seer of Lower Manpang.
[1999.34s -> 2001.55s]  See, you have heard of them.
[2002.45s -> 2005.77s]  She pauses to scratch her chin.
[2005.77s -> 2008.85s]  If you don't mind, I'd like to get back to waiting.
[2011.97s -> 2015.25s]  I saw something over in chat and I have to say it because it was very funny.
[2016.17s -> 2018.09s]  Somebody said wisdom teeth voice.
[2019.60s -> 2030.27s]  OK, I get it.
[2030.27s -> 2032.25s]  Come on, I'm acting here.
[2032.25s -> 2033.93s]  All right, you I'm going to wait.
[2033.93s -> 2035.61s]  You wait.
[2035.61s -> 2039.53s]  A thin creature emerges from the building with a curious half smile on his face.
[2040.17s -> 2043.45s]  The next creature, a dwarf enters.
[2043.45s -> 2044.21s]  I pushed to the front.
[2044.21s -> 2045.50s]  Now we're going to wait.
[2045.50s -> 2046.94s]  You continue waiting.
[2046.94s -> 2048.71s]  Nothing happens.
[2048.71s -> 2049.59s]  You wait.
[2049.59s -> 2051.50s]  You continue to wait.
[2051.50s -> 2053.14s]  And the dwarf emerges.
[2053.14s -> 2055.78s]  She, too, has a curious half smile on her face.
[2056.30s -> 2059.05s]  A black elf goes inside next.
[2059.05s -> 2059.81s]  You wait.
[2059.85s -> 2061.01s]  You keep waiting.
[2061.01s -> 2062.14s]  You wait.
[2062.14s -> 2064.38s]  You wait a little longer.
[2064.38s -> 2066.41s]  You damn it.
[2066.41s -> 2067.93s]  I didn't mean to do that.
[2067.93s -> 2068.97s]  I clicked the wrong thing.
[2068.97s -> 2070.73s]  You step out of the line.
[2070.73s -> 2073.69s]  The creatures who have joined behind you hurry forward to fill the space.
[2074.26s -> 2077.54s]  And as they do so, you see it is the thin creature whom you saw
[2077.54s -> 2078.82s]  coming out of the building.
[2078.82s -> 2081.54s]  He has rejoined the line directly behind you.
[2082.78s -> 2085.53s]  Return to the line. Shit.
[2085.53s -> 2087.90s]  You go back to the line to rejoin.
[2087.90s -> 2091.42s]  To your surprise, the creature shuffled back to let you slot
[2091.42s -> 2093.60s]  into your previous place.
[2093.60s -> 2096.76s]  The hobgoblin you spoke to before even spares you a faint smile.
[2099.20s -> 2101.42s]  What? Wait.
[2101.42s -> 2103.82s]  The black elf emerges looking furious about something.
[2104.30s -> 2107.10s]  A wood golem enters the building.
[2107.10s -> 2108.39s]  You wait.
[2108.39s -> 2111.31s]  Creatures in the line stir a little, but no one leaves the queue.
[2113.14s -> 2116.12s]  Wait. You keep waiting.
[2116.12s -> 2116.80s]  You keep waiting.
[2116.80s -> 2119.68s]  The wood golem emerges looking furious about something.
[2120.28s -> 2121.96s]  A goblin goes inside.
[2121.96s -> 2125.29s]  We wait. You wait a little longer.
[2125.73s -> 2127.78s]  The creature in the line stir.
[2127.78s -> 2129.01s]  You wait.
[2129.01s -> 2132.17s]  Goblin emerges looking furious about something.
[2132.57s -> 2139.31s]  The hobgoblin is next.
[2139.31s -> 2141.15s]  Wait. You keep waiting.
[2141.15s -> 2144.08s]  You keep waiting.
[2144.08s -> 2146.46s]  You wait a little longer.
[2146.46s -> 2149.10s]  The hobgoblin emerges looking furious about something.
[2149.10s -> 2154.33s]  A guard enters the building.
[2154.33s -> 2159.16s]  Wait. Keep waiting.
[2159.16s -> 2161.90s]  The guard emerges looking furious.
[2161.90s -> 2164.74s]  A small moth child goes inside.
[2164.74s -> 2169.27s]  Does this matter?
[2169.27s -> 2173.70s]  I forget if this matters. I don't remember.
[2173.70s -> 2175.42s]  You wait. Wait.
[2175.46s -> 2178.45s]  The creatures stir. You wait.
[2178.45s -> 2180.61s]  A small moth child emerges looking furious.
[2180.81s -> 2182.73s]  Everyone. OK. The first three people were happy.
[2182.73s -> 2185.13s]  The next six people have been very, very mad.
[2191.86s -> 2195.30s]  Hold on a second.
[2195.30s -> 2198.54s]  OK. Thin creature emerges from the building with a smile.
[2199.40s -> 2200.76s]  OK. A thin creature.
[2200.76s -> 2203.50s]  Smile. Dwarf.
[2203.50s -> 2209.76s]  Smiled. Black elf.
[2209.76s -> 2215.18s]  Angry. Everything has been angry.
[2216.10s -> 2219.02s]  OK, let's keep waiting.
[2219.02s -> 2221.24s]  You wait a little longer.
[2221.24s -> 2222.74s]  Keep waiting.
[2222.74s -> 2225.62s]  The rat faced orc emerges looking furious about something.
[2225.62s -> 2227.86s]  The one legged dwarf enters the building.
[2231.43s -> 2236.83s]  OK. OK. OK.
[2236.83s -> 2240.68s]  A lanky guard goes inside.
[2240.68s -> 2243.42s]  I feel like patience is going to pay off here.
[2243.42s -> 2248.23s]  I don't remember what happens.
[2248.23s -> 2250.87s]  OK. Black elf is next.
[2250.87s -> 2256.16s]  Did I not get to go?
[2256.16s -> 2258.54s]  Wood golem enters the building.
[2258.54s -> 2262.02s]  How come I got passed in line like three times?
[2265.06s -> 2266.18s]  Goblin goes inside.
[2266.18s -> 2266.74s]  I've been passed.
[2266.74s -> 2270.18s]  I've been I'm being I'm being toted in Mario Kart.
[2271.59s -> 2276.26s]  They're lapping me.
[2276.26s -> 2281.39s]  You wait. Hobgoblin is.
[2281.39s -> 2282.11s]  All right.
[2282.11s -> 2290.02s]  I don't know. Should I just go for it?
[2290.02s -> 2294.18s]  No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2294.18s -> 2296.30s]  All right. I need a poll because I actually I don't know what to do.
[2297.15s -> 2298.71s]  If it were me, I would have pushed to the front.
[2298.71s -> 2303.54s]  But I don't know.
[2303.54s -> 2305.18s]  Yeah, well, we need to pull.
[2305.18s -> 2309.92s]  I can get this one. It's quick.
[2309.92s -> 2310.88s]  Which one?
[2312.94s -> 2314.98s]  Wait or push to front.
[2319.24s -> 2330.28s]  Here we go. Which way are we going?
[2330.28s -> 2332.14s]  I think I know where we're going.
[2332.14s -> 2333.14s]  You need to wait your turn.
[2333.14s -> 2343.43s]  Be polite. Be polite.
[2343.43s -> 2346.02s]  I'll wait all fucking day.
[2346.02s -> 2349.10s]  That's a great comment.
[2349.10s -> 2351.58s]  You know, that person wrote that.
[2351.58s -> 2353.02s]  I'll wait all fucking day.
[2353.02s -> 2354.10s]  And you know why they said that?
[2354.10s -> 2355.45s]  Because they have ready.
[2355.45s -> 2357.41s]  They've got they got food in front of them.
[2357.41s -> 2359.70s]  They've got a full drink.
[2359.70s -> 2361.78s]  They're comfortable in their seat on the couch.
[2361.78s -> 2363.18s]  Maybe they're ready.
[2363.18s -> 2372.73s]  They're they're locked in for the long haul.
[2372.73s -> 2374.81s]  Hey, I'll wait all fucking day.
[2375.91s -> 2376.79s]  They take their phone.
[2376.79s -> 2377.79s]  They put it on silent.
[2377.79s -> 2380.02s]  They put it face down.
[2380.02s -> 2386.80s]  I ain't taking any calls today.
[2386.80s -> 2395.36s]  All right. We're doing this one more time.
[2395.36s -> 2399.94s]  Guard enters the building.
[2399.94s -> 2401.46s]  Keep waiting.
[2401.46s -> 2403.70s]  You keep waiting.
[2403.70s -> 2404.74s]  A small moth child.
[2404.74s -> 2409.83s]  I'm getting lapped again.
[2409.83s -> 2412.98s]  Waiting again.
[2412.98s -> 2418.06s]  Rat faced orc.
[2418.06s -> 2419.30s]  You wait a little longer.
[2419.30s -> 2426.50s]  A large dwarf enters the building.
[2426.50s -> 2428.02s]  OK, push to the front.
[2428.02s -> 2430.70s]  I have to do one more cycle of this.
[2433.82s -> 2435.78s]  Seventy seven percent of you said to wait.
[2437.10s -> 2444.72s]  That's a lot of people that said wait.
[2444.72s -> 2445.80s]  I'm going to click wait
[2445.80s -> 2449.85s]  ten more times than I'm pushing to the front.
[2449.85s -> 2463.71s]  Two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[2463.75s -> 2464.79s]  It's definitely I've definitely
[2464.79s -> 2467.03s]  to push in front of somebody specific.
[2467.78s -> 2470.11s]  And I don't know who.
[2470.11s -> 2472.83s]  Should I push in front of my hobgoblin friend
[2472.83s -> 2476.17s]  that I just made?
[2476.17s -> 2484.60s]  Who should I push to the front in front of?
[2484.60s -> 2486.60s]  Leave the line, Gigachad.
[2488.38s -> 2495.66s]  After all that, you don't even ride the ride.
[2497.81s -> 2500.10s]  I just get in line at Disney World.
[2500.10s -> 2501.66s]  Wait till I'm about to get called
[2501.66s -> 2503.42s]  to go into the cart and leave.
[2516.39s -> 2519.77s]  I'm just pushing to the front.
[2519.77s -> 2521.33s]  There's definitely a rhyme to this.
[2521.33s -> 2522.93s]  There's definitely I've had this.
[2522.93s -> 2526.47s]  I have to do this somehow.
[2526.47s -> 2532.91s]  I don't know who I'm cutting in front of, though.
[2532.91s -> 2534.23s]  Cut in front of the moth child
[2534.23s -> 2536.22s]  is what people are saying.
[2536.22s -> 2539.97s]  OK, you slip out of the line again,
[2539.97s -> 2542.21s]  which closes up behind you immediately
[2542.21s -> 2544.25s]  and you walk towards the door of the building.
[2545.02s -> 2547.02s]  A rat faced orc stops you.
[2550.27s -> 2556.98s]  What do you think you're doing?
[2556.98s -> 2559.35s]  Get out of my way.
[2559.35s -> 2561.43s]  I heard the teller's name is wide.
[2562.30s -> 2568.31s]  I want to see if it's worth waiting for.
[2568.31s -> 2569.54s]  I don't know.
[2569.54s -> 2571.66s]  I wouldn't want to pick a rat faced orc.
[2576.49s -> 2579.54s]  I want to see if it's worth waiting for.
[2579.54s -> 2581.47s]  Oh, it's worth it.
[2582.35s -> 2584.11s]  This is my 13th time.
[2587.69s -> 2596.48s]  But how come I can't get in?
[2596.48s -> 2600.75s]  I've been passed ten times.
[2600.79s -> 2603.87s]  You know, I heard the teller's name is wide.
[2605.53s -> 2608.60s]  Is that right?
[2608.60s -> 2613.43s]  So what?
[2613.43s -> 2614.15s]  Come in there.
[2614.15s -> 2614.95s]  All right, I'll get back.
[2614.95s -> 2617.31s]  I'm going to rejoin the line.
[2617.31s -> 2619.23s]  We get back in line.
[2619.23s -> 2623.54s]  You wait.
[2623.54s -> 2625.26s]  Now a rat faced orc is next.
[2625.26s -> 2625.98s]  No, I'm going to.
[2625.98s -> 2627.62s]  OK, I know what I'm doing.
[2627.62s -> 2628.98s]  I'm going to cut every single person
[2628.98s -> 2631.26s]  till we get the right one.
[2631.26s -> 2632.47s]  OK, here we go.
[2632.47s -> 2645.43s]  Wait. Oh, did I actually miss the opportunity?
[2646.78s -> 2653.85s]  I can't push now.
[2653.85s -> 2656.07s]  Really?
[2656.07s -> 2657.31s]  Do I actually get to do
[2657.31s -> 2662.32s]  the whole thing screwed up now?
[2662.32s -> 2681.66s]  All right. Ten more clicks and I'm done.
[2681.66s -> 2685.21s]  Wait. Talk to the thin creature.
[2686.22s -> 2690.06s]  You turn to the thin creature.
[2690.06s -> 2692.34s]  Didn't you just go in?
[2692.34s -> 2695.86s]  Yes. So why are you in line again?
[2697.78s -> 2700.39s]  Haven't you been inside yourself?
[2700.39s -> 2702.69s]  No. Oh, you'll understand
[2702.69s -> 2704.35s]  once you've been inside.
[2704.35s -> 2706.59s]  Wide explains it better than I could.
[2709.01s -> 2711.49s]  What did he tell you?
[2711.49s -> 2713.21s]  The thin creature shakes his head.
[2713.21s -> 2716.06s]  It's too personal to share.
[2716.06s -> 2718.46s]  Besides, without knowing the answers
[2718.46s -> 2719.62s]  to the previous questions,
[2719.62s -> 2723.60s]  you wouldn't understand, I think.
[2723.60s -> 2725.98s]  And what will you do with the answer?
[2725.98s -> 2727.64s]  Choose my next question.
[2727.64s -> 2729.44s]  I'm getting close to my true calling now.
[2729.44s -> 2731.94s]  I can feel it.
[2731.94s -> 2734.29s]  How many times you've been in there?
[2734.29s -> 2735.93s]  That was my 15th visit.
[2735.93s -> 2736.81s]  Every time the future
[2736.81s -> 2738.34s]  becomes a little clearer.
[2738.34s -> 2740.14s]  I see real potential now.
[2740.14s -> 2742.31s]  I could become almost anything.
[2742.31s -> 2744.11s]  I'm almost giddy with excitement.
[2744.11s -> 2745.79s]  But I'll have to wait, of course.
[2745.79s -> 2746.51s]  Please.
[2746.51s -> 2752.26s]  I need to contemplate my next question.
[2752.26s -> 2753.34s]  Why do I have to wait?
[2753.34s -> 2754.34s]  Why can't I go in?
[2754.34s -> 2762.46s]  Why are people just passing me?
[2762.46s -> 2768.65s]  God damn it.
[2768.65s -> 2771.17s]  You walk by the hawker
[2771.17s -> 2773.45s]  who is plying her trade to the crowd.
[2773.69s -> 2776.12s]  Shit.
[2776.12s -> 2777.88s]  Examine the one.
[2777.96s -> 2781.50s]  Examine the wonder stone of secrets.
[2781.50s -> 2783.34s]  Marvel as it speaks, advises,
[2783.34s -> 2787.63s]  and prophecies its sizes.
[2787.63s -> 2788.83s]  You approach the hawker
[2788.83s -> 2790.59s]  who points right at you.
[2790.59s -> 2792.51s]  Now here is a discerning patron
[2792.51s -> 2794.07s]  of the weird and wonderful.
[2794.07s -> 2796.11s]  Will he enter and experience the mysteries
[2796.11s -> 2797.87s]  that even our best magical knowledge
[2797.87s -> 2801.08s]  cannot explain?
[2801.08s -> 2803.95s]  You're a fraud.
[2803.95s -> 2805.31s]  The tone of the accusation
[2805.31s -> 2807.59s]  barely registers with the hawker.
[2807.59s -> 2811.19s]  Oh, friend, I commend you on your skepticism.
[2811.19s -> 2813.11s]  We should not believe the words of strangers.
[2813.11s -> 2815.75s]  We should judge with our own eyes.
[2815.75s -> 2818.07s]  And that is why, just for you,
[2818.07s -> 2819.99s]  I will allow an intelligent traveler
[2819.99s -> 2822.19s]  such as you to experience the stone
[2822.19s -> 2827.74s]  for only two gold pieces.
[2827.74s -> 2832.49s]  What is it?
[2832.49s -> 2834.94s]  She puffs herself up.
[2834.94s -> 2836.06s]  The stone of secrets
[2836.06s -> 2837.98s]  is an incredibly rare artifact
[2837.98s -> 2839.94s]  discovered deep within a lost cave
[2839.94s -> 2841.84s]  many moons ago.
[2841.84s -> 2843.48s]  It is the only stone in the world
[2843.48s -> 2844.92s]  which can speak.
[2844.92s -> 2846.32s]  It is not powered by magic,
[2846.32s -> 2848.00s]  but a strange alien force
[2848.00s -> 2850.21s]  unique to the old world.
[2850.25s -> 2851.81s]  The greatest magicians of our age
[2851.81s -> 2852.85s]  have examined it
[2852.85s -> 2858.58s]  and walked away confounded.
[2858.58s -> 2863.62s]  It's only two bucks.
[2863.62s -> 2865.38s]  Where are you from?
[2865.38s -> 2867.04s]  You ask.
[2867.04s -> 2869.89s]  I'm a proud daughter of the eighth slum,
[2869.89s -> 2870.97s]  but they say my family
[2870.97s -> 2873.37s]  were once great travelers and traders
[2873.37s -> 2875.93s]  crossing the whole of the old world.
[2875.93s -> 2884.39s]  Can you imagine such a journey, Trelawney?
[2884.39s -> 2889.20s]  No, she nods.
[2889.20s -> 2891.08s]  Indeed, it is but a journey
[2891.08s -> 2892.68s]  beyond all imagining,
[2892.68s -> 2894.32s]  especially for one without,
[2894.32s -> 2895.24s]  if I might say,
[2895.24s -> 2896.76s]  the traveler's blood.
[2896.76s -> 2901.94s]  The tales my stone could tell you now.
[2901.94s -> 2905.70s]  Rubbing the stone.
[2905.70s -> 2907.64s]  I will pay.
[2907.64s -> 2909.40s]  You pay the fee and the hawker beams
[2909.40s -> 2911.68s]  her gaze already slipping past you.
[2911.68s -> 2913.00s]  Here is a brave soul
[2913.00s -> 2914.24s]  who has chosen to embrace
[2914.24s -> 2915.84s]  the mystery and wonder.
[2915.84s -> 2918.15s]  Who will follow him?
[2918.15s -> 2921.21s]  It's two bucks, whatever.
[2921.21s -> 2922.09s]  If I walk through here
[2922.09s -> 2923.69s]  and it was a jump scare,
[2923.69s -> 2924.77s]  I'd be like it was two gold.
[2924.77s -> 2928.70s]  I don't even care.
[2928.70s -> 2931.46s]  Inside the tent is a dim and cramped.
[2931.46s -> 2933.27s]  It's very like that.
[2933.27s -> 2934.35s]  A large stack of boxes
[2934.35s -> 2935.11s]  sits to one side,
[2935.11s -> 2936.99s]  a cloth draped over them.
[2936.99s -> 2938.47s]  Other curiosities, no doubt,
[2938.47s -> 2939.91s]  that the hawker has shelved
[2939.91s -> 2944.22s]  in favor of the more profitable stone.
[2944.22s -> 2944.74s]  Sure, it's the box.
[2944.74s -> 2946.94s]  Let's just let's do it.
[2946.94s -> 2948.74s]  You begin to rifle through the boxes
[2948.74s -> 2950.82s]  when suddenly you are stopped short.
[2950.82s -> 2954.10s]  Then a voice booms through the tent.
[2954.10s -> 2955.30s]  I don't know who this is,
[2955.30s -> 2957.49s]  so it's going to be pretty generic.
[2957.49s -> 2960.46s]  Anor Londo.
[2960.46s -> 2962.74s]  A familiar voice.
[2962.74s -> 2964.38s]  The voice is familiar,
[2964.38s -> 2965.86s]  but quite impossible.
[2965.86s -> 2968.06s]  It is the booming tone of Shadrach,
[2968.06s -> 2971.04s]  the hermit from the backlands.
[2971.04s -> 2973.18s]  This must be a trick.
[2973.22s -> 2975.35s]  Alas, no trick,
[2975.35s -> 2977.18s]  replies the voice happily.
[2977.18s -> 2978.98s]  A fairly poor outcome for me,
[2978.98s -> 2983.30s]  I'll warrant, but no trick.
[2983.30s -> 2985.08s]  Shadrach?
[2985.08s -> 2986.28s]  Yes, yes, it is I.
[2986.28s -> 2989.22s]  It is good to see you again.
[2989.22s -> 2992.24s]  After a fashion, at least.
[2992.24s -> 2993.98s]  What happened?
[2993.98s -> 2996.50s]  I bound a piece of my spirit to this rock.
[2996.50s -> 2999.73s]  A desperate move.
[2999.73s -> 3001.40s]  Why?
[3001.40s -> 3004.44s]  The Archmage's assassins found my cave.
[3004.44s -> 3006.96s]  I was staked outside on a cross.
[3006.96s -> 3010.13s]  My body is still there, wasting away.
[3010.13s -> 3011.09s]  I was able to project
[3011.13s -> 3014.44s]  a fragment of myself into this stone.
[3014.44s -> 3018.59s]  Another into a tree.
[3018.59s -> 3021.30s]  You will not last long in there.
[3021.30s -> 3022.46s]  True.
[3022.46s -> 3025.10s]  I only saved a small portion of my mind,
[3025.10s -> 3031.86s]  and the magic binding me to the stone is tenuous.
[3031.86s -> 3033.99s]  Can I aid you?
[3033.99s -> 3035.03s]  No.
[3035.03s -> 3037.65s]  It is best you put me out of your mind.
[3037.65s -> 3042.08s]  Your own task is all that matters.
[3042.08s -> 3044.58s]  Can you help me?
[3044.58s -> 3046.26s]  I only hope I can help.
[3046.26s -> 3047.96s]  I am but a rock.
[3047.96s -> 3051.00s]  The stone dulls in color a touch,
[3051.00s -> 3052.76s]  as though it sighed.
[3053.76s -> 3056.32s]  But all I have learned of Manpang
[3056.32s -> 3057.96s]  has made my heart heavier.
[3062.64s -> 3067.64s]  All right, we got to get some questions answered here.
[3067.64s -> 3071.82s]  Beat the Archmage to death with the soul rock.
[3071.82s -> 3077.66s]  Hey, make that happen.
[3077.66s -> 3078.87s]  Okay.
[3078.87s -> 3083.32s]  What secrets does Manpang hold, do you ask?
[3083.32s -> 3086.16s]  The greatest secret are the vaults of Manpang,
[3086.16s -> 3088.44s]  buried somewhere beneath the city.
[3088.44s -> 3090.32s]  They hold the treasure of the fortress,
[3090.32s -> 3093.80s]  but they are heavily guarded.
[3093.80s -> 3096.30s]  What do you know about these vaults?
[3096.30s -> 3098.38s]  The stone would shake its head
[3098.38s -> 3100.82s]  if it had a head to shake.
[3100.82s -> 3102.22s]  Nothing.
[3102.22s -> 3104.92s]  But the crown will not be in any vault.
[3104.92s -> 3108.97s]  It is too precious for that.
[3108.97s -> 3111.98s]  How do I reach the Archmage?
[3111.98s -> 3115.47s]  You must enter the Sorcerer's Spike.
[3115.47s -> 3117.53s]  But its doors have never opened.
[3117.53s -> 3119.77s]  They were made by the necromancer Throbin,
[3119.77s -> 3122.73s]  locked in three ways and then sealed in a fourth.
[3122.73s -> 3126.85s]  The last seal was a bind that required he took his life.
[3126.85s -> 3128.77s]  But the only power that can defeat the crown
[3128.77s -> 3131.53s]  lies behind those doors.
[3131.57s -> 3136.40s]  The rock rattles and then falls still for a time.
[3136.40s -> 3139.65s]  I am sorry, Anor Lander.
[3139.65s -> 3144.34s]  Lack the strength to continue speaking.
[3144.34s -> 3149.22s]  My body has already failed and my spirit
[3149.22s -> 3152.51s]  cannot stay anchored to this rock forever.
[3152.51s -> 3164.58s]  Keep your wits about you and know that I am proud.
[3164.58s -> 3172.17s]  The rock stills as Shadrach's voice fades.
[3172.17s -> 3175.83s]  Shadrach, what the heck?
[3175.83s -> 3179.83s]  Master class actor.
[3182.01s -> 3188.02s]  Acting.
[3188.02s -> 3189.42s]  He does not care.
[3189.42s -> 3193.37s]  All he cares about is acting.
[3193.37s -> 3194.21s]  He doesn't even care.
[3194.21s -> 3195.05s]  He's not even sad.
[3195.05s -> 3199.20s]  He just wants to keep just acting.
[3199.20s -> 3202.12s]  To be fair, I did finish that and was like acting.
[3202.12s -> 3213.26s]  So I understand the criticism.
[3213.26s -> 3216.03s]  Can you act like you care?
[3216.03s -> 3218.14s]  Oh, all right.
[3218.14s -> 3219.06s]  Throw me a curve ball there.
[3219.06s -> 3220.52s]  Okay, yeah.
[3220.52s -> 3221.48s]  That's a tough one.
[3221.48s -> 3222.40s]  See if I can do that.
[3222.40s -> 3224.13s]  That's a hard role.
[3224.13s -> 3225.17s]  Well, that's quite a role.
[3225.17s -> 3226.97s]  I have to like care.
[3226.97s -> 3230.21s]  Okay, goodness.
[3230.21s -> 3232.82s]  That's gonna be hard.
[3232.82s -> 3237.06s]  Outside the tent, the Hawker claps you on the shoulder.
[3237.06s -> 3239.90s]  Well, friend, did the stone unlock the mysteries
[3239.90s -> 3241.38s]  of the universe for you?
[3241.38s -> 3243.26s]  Did it dazzle your senses?
[3243.26s -> 3246.84s]  Delight your spirit?
[3246.84s -> 3249.40s]  Indeed, you're exploiting that creature.
[3251.66s -> 3256.30s]  But he's dead, so I don't know.
[3256.30s -> 3260.84s]  Do I just walk?
[3260.84s -> 3262.22s]  Walk away.
[3262.22s -> 3267.14s]  You walk away without a word.
[3267.14s -> 3268.62s]  All right, am I getting that weapon?
[3268.62s -> 3278.34s]  I think I have one more opportunity to get it.
[3278.34s -> 3279.26s]  You return to the stalls,
[3279.26s -> 3282.18s]  noisy with the sounds of aggressive haggling.
[3282.18s -> 3284.82s]  Nearby, a fight breaks out over the price of cloth,
[3284.82s -> 3288.35s]  but there's nothing more to be bought.
[3288.35s -> 3291.30s]  Is there anything else that I missed?
[3291.30s -> 3294.30s]  No opportunity to go this way.
[3294.30s -> 3297.59s]  Let me check.
[3297.59s -> 3298.43s]  There is not.
[3298.43s -> 3302.91s]  All right, so we have to go back to the square.
[3302.91s -> 3304.79s]  You head away from the maze of stalls and shops.
[3304.79s -> 3307.16s]  Which way now?
[3307.16s -> 3310.82s]  All right, we got another opportunity.
[3310.82s -> 3312.90s]  There is the west side,
[3312.90s -> 3316.66s]  which I'm imagining takes us through here.
[3316.66s -> 3317.50s]  Down here.
[3317.50s -> 3319.73s]  I'll give you a bigger picture so you can see again.
[3319.73s -> 3322.34s]  Are we staying west?
[3322.34s -> 3325.06s]  There's also this here.
[3325.06s -> 3327.28s]  There's this here.
[3328.00s -> 3331.50s]  There's all this over on the eastern side.
[3331.50s -> 3336.51s]  And there's actually the fortress itself, which is here.
[3336.51s -> 3339.07s]  Are we gonna go?
[3339.07s -> 3341.42s]  I'm gonna make it pretty general.
[3341.42s -> 3342.38s]  I can run the poll too.
[3342.38s -> 3345.06s]  It's probably just way easier.
[3345.06s -> 3350.45s]  Because I'll just do it very, very quickly.
[3350.45s -> 3357.30s]  West, north, or east?
[3357.30s -> 3366.20s]  Where do you wanna go?
[3366.20s -> 3367.64s]  Yeah, for more complicated polls
[3367.64s -> 3370.00s]  that require a sentence or so for each answer,
[3370.00s -> 3373.09s]  or at least a few words, then yeah.
[3373.09s -> 3375.01s]  But in like the 10 seconds of stream delay
[3375.01s -> 3377.21s]  it takes to communicate it,
[3377.21s -> 3391.24s]  I think it's easy for me just to write it.
[3392.24s -> 3403.14s]  It's kind of, could go either way.
[3403.14s -> 3404.42s]  He's on the road to retirement
[3404.42s -> 3408.13s]  and he learned how to do polls.
[3408.13s -> 3425.34s]  I've also been very on time since talking about that.
[3425.34s -> 3436.62s]  Good job, peepaw.
[3436.62s -> 3438.91s]  All right, we're going west.
[3438.91s -> 3443.99s]  We're gonna stay on this side.
[3443.99s -> 3446.03s]  You hit him with the peepaw?
[3446.03s -> 3448.01s]  What?
[3448.01s -> 3454.40s]  What?
[3454.40s -> 3455.76s]  You hit the dude with peepaw?
[3455.76s -> 3458.51s]  You hit him with peepaw?
[3458.51s -> 3460.85s]  Is that bad?
[3460.85s -> 3462.18s]  All right, here we go.
[3462.26s -> 3467.18s]  An old beggar woman lounges against a well nearby,
[3467.18s -> 3469.40s]  watching people come and go from the market.
[3469.40s -> 3472.72s]  A wider road leads west into a rundown area of the city.
[3472.72s -> 3476.90s]  Clouds rumble as they roll across the dimming sky.
[3476.90s -> 3482.26s]  The beggar, let's go to the beggar.
[3482.26s -> 3483.98s]  You walk over to the well where an old woman,
[3483.98s -> 3487.10s]  little more than a bundle of rags, sits.
[3487.10s -> 3490.63s]  She does not look at you as you approach.
[3490.63s -> 3492.34s]  Look at the woman.
[3492.34s -> 3495.18s]  Her face is obscured by a shapeless hood.
[3495.18s -> 3496.62s]  She rarely acknowledges anyone,
[3496.62s -> 3499.02s]  not even holding out her hand for alms.
[3503.82s -> 3506.70s]  Greet her.
[3506.70s -> 3508.71s]  Greetings, old woman.
[3508.71s -> 3511.30s]  You declare.
[3511.30s -> 3514.88s]  I think I remember this one.
[3514.88s -> 3518.14s]  I remember this.
[3518.14s -> 3525.52s]  This is a very old footage.
[3525.52s -> 3527.26s]  Those that know, they know.
[3527.26s -> 3532.38s]  She looks moldy.
[3532.38s -> 3540.47s]  I think back in 2016, this clip was like,
[3540.47s -> 3542.51s]  I think the first time that a clip on the channel
[3542.51s -> 3545.99s]  really like, whoa, people watched it.
[3545.99s -> 3548.91s]  There's a lot of views on that clip.
[3548.95s -> 3550.23s]  I remember that was kind of like,
[3550.23s -> 3554.10s]  holy shit, there's a lot of views on this clip.
[3554.10s -> 3556.91s]  2016.
[3556.91s -> 3557.75s]  All right, but anyways,
[3557.75s -> 3561.81s]  we can be nostalgic all we want.
[3561.81s -> 3563.38s]  Let's continue.
[3563.38s -> 3565.30s]  He's reminiscing.
[3565.30s -> 3569.28s]  Her voice when she speaks is raspy, barely above a whisper.
[3569.28s -> 3572.04s]  And her eyes, when they meet yours,
[3572.04s -> 3576.30s]  are a smooth, glossy black.
[3576.30s -> 3579.47s]  There you are, my love.
[3579.47s -> 3582.27s]  Found you now.
[3582.27s -> 3585.95s]  Spare an old blind woman a coin,
[3585.95s -> 3591.60s]  left by a crust of bread, perhaps.
[3591.60s -> 3593.12s]  Here, you can have a coin.
[3593.12s -> 3595.12s]  You toss a gold coin into her lap
[3595.12s -> 3600.83s]  and she rocks back and forth, grinning.
[3600.83s -> 3605.26s]  You have made Javine a happier woman.
[3605.26s -> 3607.78s]  Bless you for helping me live out my last days.
[3611.52s -> 3617.55s]  Now, love, anything else for an old blind woman?
[3617.55s -> 3619.70s]  Who are you?
[3619.70s -> 3624.96s]  Well, now, my love, most call me Hergifilia.
[3624.96s -> 3627.62s]  But you can call me Javine.
[3627.62s -> 3631.40s]  It is my prettier name.
[3631.40s -> 3634.13s]  And now you are a beggar.
[3634.17s -> 3639.88s]  I was a healer before, but now, yes, now I beg.
[3639.88s -> 3643.98s]  I sit here every day with little to pass the time,
[3643.98s -> 3647.79s]  tormenting I receive from the Sightmasters.
[3647.79s -> 3650.43s]  Sightmasters here in Mang-Pang Shirley,
[3650.43s -> 3654.31s]  she must be mistaken.
[3654.31s -> 3658.57s]  There can be no Sightmasters here, you assure her.
[3658.57s -> 3660.29s]  Know about them, do you?
[3662.85s -> 3664.01s]  Next you'll be.
[3664.01s -> 3669.33s]  Tell me you're the Anor Lander you are.
[3669.33s -> 3671.11s]  I am.
[3672.97s -> 3677.51s]  And fresh-faced young beauty am I.
[3677.55s -> 3683.01s]  Little Sightmasters, they're like a pox on me.
[3683.01s -> 3687.30s]  One lacking sight is a source of much curiosity to them.
[3687.30s -> 3688.86s]  Half of them want to kill me
[3688.86s -> 3691.04s]  and half of them are in love with me.
[3691.04s -> 3697.23s]  And those halves aren't entirely separate halves.
[3697.23s -> 3702.06s]  The ones from my homeland were honorable.
[3702.06s -> 3709.78s]  These may be the outcasts then, it is hard to say.
[3709.78s -> 3712.37s]  What happened to your eyes?
[3712.37s -> 3715.90s]  Well, you don't waste time with pleasantries, do you?
[3715.90s -> 3719.06s]  But I'll tell you my tale.
[3719.06s -> 3721.98s]  I was called on by the Archmage himself
[3721.98s -> 3725.22s]  to examine one of his creation.
[3725.22s -> 3727.93s]  The Archmage makes creatures, you see,
[3727.93s -> 3730.54s]  of all mixtures and kinds.
[3730.54s -> 3732.66s]  This one was a mucousy, slimy sort of a thing
[3732.66s -> 3737.43s]  called a mu-galactic, if I remember.
[3737.43s -> 3740.34s]  A miserable thing born totally without fear.
[3740.34s -> 3746.76s]  They're almost deaf and speak only in whisper.
[3746.76s -> 3749.90s]  Why does the Archmage make such creatures?
[3749.90s -> 3751.79s]  Why does the Archmage do anything?
[3751.79s -> 3753.19s]  Why does he sleep for a hundred years
[3753.19s -> 3757.66s]  and wake up to measure the positions of the stars?
[3757.66s -> 3759.06s]  If I knew the workings of his mind,
[3759.06s -> 3761.78s]  I would have twisted them to my own end years ago,
[3761.78s -> 3764.84s]  but I don't.
[3764.84s -> 3765.68s]  Oh.
[3769.34s -> 3770.62s]  Ew.
[3770.62s -> 3772.33s]  What a lovely chat.
[3772.33s -> 3775.64s]  I so rarely get to talk these days, love.
[3775.64s -> 3777.31s]  Come back anytime,
[3777.31s -> 3780.67s]  especially if you slay one of the Sightmasters.
[3781.75s -> 3785.56s]  Like this.
[3785.56s -> 3788.41s]  I have killed a Sightmaster, you lie.
[3791.10s -> 3793.86s]  You're a silver-tongued one, aren't you?
[3793.86s -> 3796.98s]  Know all the right things to say, but it's no good.
[3796.98s -> 3798.81s]  I'm not stupid.
[3798.81s -> 3801.49s]  I got sight.
[3801.49s -> 3803.49s]  You leave the woman huddled by the wall.
[3808.70s -> 3809.86s]  Why would you lie?
[3809.86s -> 3811.19s]  I don't know.
[3811.19s -> 3817.71s]  Didn't I?
[3817.71s -> 3818.55s]  Oh, one died.
[3818.55s -> 3819.39s]  No, no, no.
[3819.39s -> 3822.54s]  One died in front of me.
[3822.54s -> 3827.78s]  That doesn't count.
[3827.78s -> 3830.97s]  She saw through your lie.
[3830.97s -> 3833.46s]  Why are you taking credit for that?
[3833.46s -> 3834.70s]  Well, I don't want to take credit for it.
[3834.70s -> 3838.36s]  I just, I don't know.
[3838.36s -> 3841.01s]  You've returned to the west side of the square.
[3841.01s -> 3843.86s]  Jovine appears to go back to sleep.
[3843.86s -> 3847.03s]  A wider road leads west into a rundown area of the city.
[3847.03s -> 3849.23s]  The sun is almost set and the sky has turned a deep purple.
[3849.23s -> 3853.05s]  It'll be night soon.
[3853.05s -> 3858.38s]  All right, we're going this way.
[3858.38s -> 3861.66s]  You walk west out of the square following a wide road.
[3861.66s -> 3864.12s]  It passes by a larger gate.
[3864.12s -> 3865.52s]  Another night begins.
[3865.52s -> 3866.68s]  You should try to find a place to sleep,
[3866.68s -> 3868.69s]  especially on an empty stomach.
[3868.69s -> 3870.17s]  Before you is a stone facade
[3870.17s -> 3871.97s]  that stretches the length of the street.
[3871.97s -> 3874.93s]  It seems to be closed for the night.
[3874.93s -> 3877.60s]  Oh, it's nighttime.
[3877.60s -> 3879.98s]  Arched windows are placed evenly,
[3879.98s -> 3882.46s]  though several panes are missing.
[3882.46s -> 3884.58s]  Worn steps lead to a door that is rather small
[3884.58s -> 3886.33s]  for such a large building.
[3886.33s -> 3891.49s]  The doors are sealed fast for the night.
[3891.49s -> 3899.02s]  Um, should I just sleep out here?
[3899.02s -> 3901.93s]  You should just read a book at this point.
[3901.93s -> 3904.44s]  I think that is exactly what we're doing.
[3904.44s -> 3906.52s]  Sorcery is a book.
[3906.52s -> 3911.34s]  It has been, its pages have been ported to a digital,
[3911.34s -> 3912.94s]  but it's a digital book.
[3912.94s -> 3919.06s]  It's what we're doing.
[3919.06s -> 3920.86s]  You spent so much time waiting in line.
[3920.86s -> 3928.91s]  Uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep going.
[3929.19s -> 3935.70s]  I feel like that's not a safe place to go.
[3935.70s -> 3938.10s]  The road curves along the edge of a tall stone wall,
[3938.10s -> 3940.57s]  eventually reaching a low metal door.
[3940.57s -> 3945.42s]  The moon moves slowly across the dark sky.
[3945.42s -> 3947.00s]  All right, we got a door.
[3947.00s -> 3949.64s]  The door is made of thin strips of metal riveted together
[3949.64s -> 3952.34s]  with a few gaps and holes between the plates.
[3952.34s -> 3953.26s]  Peering through the holes,
[3953.26s -> 3956.06s]  you make out a sea of waving grass stalks,
[3956.06s -> 3959.71s]  tall and clearly half wild.
[3959.71s -> 3961.30s]  Going.
[3961.30s -> 3962.82s]  You push at the door and are surprised to find
[3962.82s -> 3964.02s]  it is not locked.
[3964.02s -> 3966.34s]  It is, however, heavy enough that it swings shut
[3966.34s -> 3967.83s]  when you release it.
[3967.83s -> 3970.35s]  You had better sleep when you can find somewhere safe.
[3970.35s -> 3973.99s]  Next.
[3973.99s -> 3977.42s]  Oh shit, wait, that was for this.
[3977.42s -> 3986.38s]  I don't think we sleep in a field.
[3986.38s -> 3988.02s]  Remember, unironically, you're the type of person
[3988.02s -> 3989.50s]  to close your eyes while shooting a gun
[3989.50s -> 3998.17s]  so the noise doesn't hurt your ears.
[3998.17s -> 4000.13s]  You don't know, you don't know anything about me.
[4002.22s -> 4003.06s]  Come on, dude.
[4005.83s -> 4007.03s]  Well, how do you, why would you even,
[4007.03s -> 4013.14s]  how do you even know that?
[4013.14s -> 4016.12s]  That was a deep cut.
[4016.12s -> 4019.29s]  You don't like the sound of tape, that's how we know.
[4019.29s -> 4026.69s]  All right, me not enjoying this.
[4026.69s -> 4030.62s]  We're going in the field.
[4030.62s -> 4033.39s]  That touched a nerve.
[4033.39s -> 4035.19s]  Yeah, cause you know why?
[4035.19s -> 4037.36s]  Cause I don't have a rebuttal,
[4037.36s -> 4039.20s]  but you all know that I have one.
[4039.20s -> 4040.90s]  I just can't give one.
[4040.90s -> 4042.74s]  I can't give a rebuttal.
[4042.74s -> 4045.55s]  Cause like, how do I prove that?
[4045.55s -> 4048.05s]  I could tell you it's not true.
[4048.05s -> 4049.33s]  How do I prove that?
[4049.33s -> 4051.85s]  Me acknowledging that person's criticism
[4051.85s -> 4057.14s]  means I have to, how do I prove that person wrong?
[4057.14s -> 4063.19s]  It's a no win scenario for me.
[4063.19s -> 4064.63s]  I have to dodge the ax.
[4064.63s -> 4067.89s]  I do.
[4067.89s -> 4068.93s]  I got to dodge that ax.
[4075.54s -> 4078.36s]  I have to go to a shooting range,
[4078.36s -> 4081.40s]  but to prove that I don't close my eyes
[4081.40s -> 4083.04s]  when firing a firearm,
[4083.04s -> 4086.73s]  that's that important to you all.
[4086.73s -> 4088.87s]  That is this important.
[4088.87s -> 4091.18s]  I have to prove it.
[4091.18s -> 4092.42s]  I don't want to do that.
[4092.42s -> 4102.02s]  I don't want to go to like a shooting range.
[4102.02s -> 4105.35s]  All right, I'll write it down.
[4105.35s -> 4106.51s]  Just because I wrote it down
[4106.51s -> 4107.75s]  doesn't mean I'm going to do it.
[4107.75s -> 4109.33s]  It just means I'm going to think about it.
[4109.33s -> 4110.61s]  I'm just going to write it down.
[4110.61s -> 4111.89s]  It's never happening,
[4111.89s -> 4114.69s]  but just know that it's made it past the barrier
[4114.69s -> 4122.95s]  of I wrote it down.
[4122.95s -> 4123.79s]  Okay.
[4123.79s -> 4130.65s]  You slip under the archway into a wide field of wheatgrass.
[4130.65s -> 4133.63s]  Each stalk is taller than you stand.
[4133.63s -> 4135.83s]  The heavy door slams shut behind you.
[4135.83s -> 4138.86s]  That's not good.
[4138.86s -> 4140.26s]  You look over the door.
[4140.26s -> 4142.34s]  It is solid, but seems in good repair,
[4142.34s -> 4144.80s]  as though used fairly frequently.
[4144.80s -> 4154.74s]  It does not appear to be locked.
[4155.18s -> 4160.42s]  I'm just going to move through the grass.
[4160.42s -> 4171.29s]  Inevitably, I want to be here.
[4171.29s -> 4173.17s]  You walk on through the long grass.
[4173.17s -> 4176.38s]  Then something large slithers over your foot.
[4176.38s -> 4180.30s]  Hopping back, you see a large snake disappear into the wheat.
[4180.30s -> 4181.96s]  No, back away.
[4181.96s -> 4183.32s]  You back away from the snake.
[4183.32s -> 4185.80s]  The stalks close around you.
[4185.80s -> 4189.41s]  Where did it go?
[4189.41s -> 4194.07s]  I can make it.
[4194.07s -> 4196.19s]  Why did you emphasize large so heavily?
[4196.19s -> 4198.23s]  Because it was in, it was like bolded.
[4198.23s -> 4206.47s]  It was like in a italics.
[4206.47s -> 4207.95s]  You stride onwards through the field of wheat.
[4207.95s -> 4209.39s]  The spire stands in front of you,
[4209.39s -> 4211.74s]  as high as an ancient tree.
[4211.74s -> 4213.02s]  But impossibly thin.
[4213.02s -> 4214.95s]  How can it stay upright?
[4214.95s -> 4219.25s]  At the base is an opening just large enough to enter.
[4219.25s -> 4220.09s]  Look up?
[4220.09s -> 4221.68s]  Let's see.
[4221.68s -> 4224.72s]  The spire is built from tiny stacked stones
[4224.72s -> 4227.02s]  into a low pointed tower.
[4227.02s -> 4230.22s]  It is clearly old and somewhat poorly maintained.
[4230.22s -> 4231.70s]  There's a low door at its base,
[4231.70s -> 4234.65s]  though it hardly seems large enough for a person to enter.
[4234.65s -> 4236.49s]  You could venture inside the dim space
[4236.49s -> 4237.89s]  within the narrow spire.
[4237.89s -> 4243.27s]  It should provide a safe place to sleep.
[4243.27s -> 4247.42s]  Okay.
[4247.42s -> 4250.88s]  Well, we're going in.
[4250.88s -> 4253.28s]  Weak moonlight filters in from above,
[4253.28s -> 4255.52s]  but the ceiling is shrouded from view.
[4255.52s -> 4256.64s]  There is no floor,
[4256.64s -> 4259.08s]  but the grass underfoot is pale and short.
[4259.08s -> 4261.16s]  At the center of the room is a small shrine,
[4261.16s -> 4267.50s]  a cut stump of wood on which stands a tiny clay idol.
[4267.50s -> 4272.34s]  I'm gonna pick this up and I'm gonna get smushed.
[4272.34s -> 4274.70s]  Search the space.
[4274.70s -> 4276.10s]  You investigate around the shrine,
[4276.10s -> 4279.74s]  but find nothing except a rotten ladder bolted to one wall.
[4279.74s -> 4284.33s]  Most of its rungs missing.
[4284.33s -> 4286.66s]  Uh, what about the shrine?
[4286.66s -> 4289.14s]  You approach the shrine, a hefty tree stump.
[4289.14s -> 4292.55s]  It has been carried here and carefully cut and sanded.
[4292.55s -> 4296.43s]  The idol on top is unpainted clay.
[4296.43s -> 4297.31s]  Pray at the shrine.
[4297.31s -> 4302.22s]  Ooh, what's the idol?
[4302.22s -> 4305.66s]  The idol is small enough that you need to squat to see it.
[4305.66s -> 4308.58s]  It is roughly made with pits and defects.
[4308.58s -> 4309.90s]  It is human shaped,
[4309.90s -> 4312.74s]  clutching a sword that points towards the ground.
[4312.74s -> 4316.62s]  It lacks a face and is unnaturally cold to the touch,
[4316.62s -> 4321.33s]  as though it drank your warmth.
[4321.33s -> 4330.41s]  Uh, uh, it's either pray and get a new god,
[4330.41s -> 4338.70s]  or maybe this is not a good thing.
[4338.70s -> 4350.62s]  Uh, pray, leave, alone, destroy.
[4352.31s -> 4353.47s]  Which one?
[4353.47s -> 4363.25s]  Cause I really don't, I really don't know.
[4363.25s -> 4375.39s]  Is it gonna be that god of gods asshole again?
[4375.39s -> 4379.58s]  This sounds like an evil god.
[4379.58s -> 4389.13s]  I don't remember, so.
[4389.13s -> 4391.27s]  What gods are left?
[4391.27s -> 4400.54s]  Um, I think there's a few here in the fourth game.
[4400.54s -> 4403.04s]  All right, well it's gonna be pray.
[4403.04s -> 4407.42s]  All right, pray at the shrine, let's go.
[4407.42s -> 4409.68s]  You kneel down to pray at the shrine.
[4409.68s -> 4414.11s]  Your mind empties and you hear whispering from far below.
[4414.11s -> 4417.43s]  The earth shifts slightly as the empty heavens recoils
[4417.43s -> 4420.14s]  from the presence in the narrow room.
[4420.14s -> 4425.18s]  Words are coming unbidden to your mind.
[4425.18s -> 4427.37s]  Whisper the words.
[4427.37s -> 4428.81s]  You murmur the words in your mind
[4428.81s -> 4431.01s]  and they grow thicker and faster,
[4431.01s -> 4434.62s]  turning from trickle, torrent.
[4434.62s -> 4437.34s]  There are prayers for suffering, for safety,
[4437.34s -> 4439.98s]  for rain and sun and dry lands.
[4439.98s -> 4441.66s]  There are words for a ruined world
[4441.66s -> 4444.42s]  and the words for a breaking bud.
[4444.42s -> 4447.26s]  There are tumbling seasons and birds in flight
[4447.26s -> 4449.55s]  and stars in the sky.
[4449.55s -> 4452.59s]  The spire in which you stand seems to extend in height
[4452.59s -> 4454.89s]  as though its tip touched the sky
[4454.89s -> 4460.09s]  and its base lay at the center of the world.
[4460.09s -> 4463.63s]  Keep going.
[4463.63s -> 4465.47s]  You murmur onwards,
[4465.47s -> 4466.91s]  but despite the extent of the space
[4466.91s -> 4469.14s]  your prayers have created,
[4469.14s -> 4471.03s]  no voice enters it.
[4471.03s -> 4472.31s]  No voice replies.
[4472.31s -> 4474.50s]  This place is empty.
[4474.50s -> 4478.70s]  Your words dry up, spent, as the earth shifts again.
[4478.70s -> 4480.50s]  The spire is once more silent.
[4480.50s -> 4483.55s]  In this place, there is nothing, only silence.
[4483.55s -> 4486.90s]  Your maximum stamina has increased.
[4486.90s -> 4490.18s]  24.
[4490.18s -> 4493.42s]  Now we go to sleep.
[4493.42s -> 4494.98s]  This place seems safe enough.
[4494.98s -> 4498.03s]  You lie down and gratefully close your eyes,
[4498.03s -> 4500.86s]  but your sleep is not without interruption.
[4500.86s -> 4503.90s]  In the dead of night, you are stirred by a bright light
[4503.90s -> 4511.20s]  playing over your eyes.
[4511.20s -> 4513.23s]  Look.
[4513.23s -> 4514.51s]  You lift your eyelids a crack
[4514.51s -> 4516.59s]  to see a brilliant bright glow
[4516.59s -> 4519.71s]  radiating from the idol on the altar.
[4519.71s -> 4522.27s]  It pulses like a breath.
[4522.27s -> 4524.07s]  Your breath clouds in front of your face.
[4524.07s -> 4530.38s]  When did it become so cold?
[4530.38s -> 4541.84s]  I feel like we keep watching.
[4541.84s -> 4546.05s]  You watch, and a worshiper arrives.
[4546.05s -> 4547.89s]  A hunched figure scuttles into the chamber
[4547.89s -> 4549.93s]  to crouch before the idol.
[4549.93s -> 4551.01s]  They have not noticed you,
[4551.01s -> 4554.16s]  or else you are unimportant to them.
[4554.16s -> 4555.44s]  They're whispering to the idol,
[4555.44s -> 4558.19s]  voice soft and pleading.
[4558.19s -> 4560.95s]  Excuse me!
[4560.95s -> 4567.30s]  Uh, I think I'm just gonna lie still.
[4567.30s -> 4571.40s]  You wait, regulating your breathing to appear asleep.
[4571.40s -> 4573.32s]  The figure continues to whisper at the idol,
[4573.32s -> 4576.63s]  their words becoming increasingly frantic.
[4576.63s -> 4579.23s]  They stop mid-sentence, holding back a sob.
[4579.23s -> 4580.55s]  After a long pause,
[4580.55s -> 4582.39s]  they turn away from the altar,
[4582.39s -> 4587.12s]  struggling to their feet.
[4587.12s -> 4589.26s]  Greet the figure.
[4589.26s -> 4591.66s]  You open your eyes as the figure passes
[4591.66s -> 4594.98s]  the end of where you lie.
[4594.98s -> 4596.62s]  Greetings.
[4596.62s -> 4598.22s]  The figure gasps.
[4598.22s -> 4601.64s]  Annalender, you are awake?
[4601.64s -> 4604.02s]  Uh, shing!
[4604.02s -> 4605.70s]  That's not me.
[4605.70s -> 4611.34s]  You know me?
[4611.34s -> 4612.70s]  Do you know me?
[4612.70s -> 4614.46s]  You ask, your voice is calm
[4614.46s -> 4616.99s]  in the gentle darkness of the spire.
[4616.99s -> 4620.21s]  The figure chokes a sob.
[4620.21s -> 4621.97s]  I've always loved you.
[4621.97s -> 4625.55s]  How could I not recognize you now?
[4625.55s -> 4626.99s]  Does the figure lie?
[4626.99s -> 4629.67s]  You cannot see the eyes below the cowl,
[4629.67s -> 4631.23s]  but if you could,
[4631.23s -> 4638.51s]  they would be sobbing.
[4638.51s -> 4640.99s]  Uh, what trick is this?
[4640.99s -> 4643.37s]  You ask suspiciously.
[4643.37s -> 4645.70s]  The figure shakes its head.
[4645.70s -> 4647.12s]  No trick.
[4647.12s -> 4649.12s]  I cannot control my heart.
[4649.12s -> 4653.46s]  I was made to love you.
[4653.46s -> 4657.08s]  Come over here where I can see you.
[4657.08s -> 4660.52s]  I yearn for you, the creature replies plaintively,
[4660.52s -> 4664.22s]  but I love you too much to do what I was made to do.
[4664.22s -> 4665.58s]  A single tear catches the light
[4665.58s -> 4672.10s]  as it rolls down the figure's cheek.
[4672.10s -> 4672.98s]  Why are you crying?
[4672.98s -> 4675.61s]  Like, who are you?
[4675.61s -> 4679.65s]  Oh, Annalander, I prayed for a vision of you,
[4679.65s -> 4681.92s]  but what I was told...
[4681.92s -> 4687.98s]  Oh, tell me.
[4687.98s -> 4691.78s]  You will die here in Mampang.
[4691.78s -> 4694.98s]  Oh, oh, it's awful.
[4694.98s -> 4697.82s]  Before you ever reach the great doors of Throbin,
[4697.82s -> 4700.43s]  you will die.
[4700.43s -> 4702.64s]  Get out while you can.
[4702.68s -> 4703.52s]  The figure...
[4703.52s -> 4705.84s]  Why does this turn into Dawn Nots?
[4705.84s -> 4708.30s]  The figure is shaking its head sadly.
[4708.30s -> 4712.86s]  Oh, you will die over and over and over again.
[4712.86s -> 4715.62s]  With that, the figure rushes out into the night,
[4715.62s -> 4720.26s]  sobbing and wailing as though their heart were breaking.
[4720.26s -> 4723.62s]  The remainder of the night passes in uneasy sleep.
[4723.62s -> 4729.73s]  You sleep and you do not dream.
[4729.73s -> 4731.45s]  Who is this person?
[4731.45s -> 4740.48s]  Who the fuck was this person?
[4740.48s -> 4742.00s]  You gained some max stamina,
[4742.00s -> 4745.20s]  lost some gold, and searched the wheat fields,
[4745.20s -> 4748.28s]  and you spoke to Shadrach's stone.
[4748.28s -> 4751.22s]  The Archmage is unaware of you still.
[4751.22s -> 4754.23s]  That was not Flanker, though.
[4754.23s -> 4755.11s]  You hurry to your feet.
[4755.11s -> 4757.91s]  Let's get on top of the ladder.
[4757.91s -> 4758.87s]  You attempt to scale the ladder,
[4758.87s -> 4760.59s]  but there are too few handholds,
[4760.59s -> 4763.36s]  and the ladder is far too old to be of any use.
[4763.36s -> 4766.33s]  Even if there was anything worth climbing up to,
[4766.33s -> 4767.95s]  you leave the spire.
[4767.95s -> 4771.96s]  The sun breaks over the eastern wall.
[4771.96s -> 4785.12s]  I wonder how differently that can play out.
[4785.12s -> 4786.44s]  Well, I'm gonna go this way.
[4786.44s -> 4789.22s]  I'm curious about this.
[4789.22s -> 4791.34s]  You pace on through the tall, swaying stems.
[4791.34s -> 4795.20s]  Stalks break and crack around you as you walk.
[4798.47s -> 4800.75s]  What are your thoughts on banana bread?
[4800.75s -> 4801.90s]  Beautiful.
[4801.90s -> 4803.10s]  Wonderful.
[4803.10s -> 4805.98s]  It's fantastic.
[4805.98s -> 4812.62s]  I think it's great.
[4812.62s -> 4815.57s]  I don't like bananas, but I like banana bread.
[4815.57s -> 4819.01s]  It's so funny because a regular banana,
[4819.01s -> 4821.95s]  I would put on like B or C tier,
[4821.95s -> 4827.62s]  but everything made with banana is S.
[4827.62s -> 4829.83s]  Banana bread, S.
[4829.83s -> 4832.43s]  Banana pudding, banana cream pie, S.
[4832.43s -> 4834.34s]  S.
[4834.34s -> 4836.96s]  Regular banana the fruit?
[4836.96s -> 4838.96s]  It's a B or an A.
[4838.96s -> 4841.00s]  It's a B.
[4841.00s -> 4842.88s]  But I love all the things you make with banana
[4842.88s -> 4844.80s]  more than the actual fruit.
[4845.76s -> 4846.68s]  Banana muffins.
[4846.68s -> 4849.55s]  Oh yeah.
[4849.55s -> 4851.86s]  That's S tier.
[4851.86s -> 4853.26s]  It's A at least.
[4853.26s -> 4854.90s]  Where did I put it when I did the fruit tier list
[4854.90s -> 4857.76s]  like three years ago?
[4857.76s -> 4858.84s]  I think I put it pretty high.
[4858.84s -> 4866.22s]  I think it was like A or S.
[4866.22s -> 4871.29s]  It was C.
[4871.29s -> 4874.08s]  Bananas that are about to turn brown are S tier.
[4874.08s -> 4875.35s]  Oh yeah.
[4875.35s -> 4880.22s]  A ripe banana is the best thing to put in a smoothie.
[4880.22s -> 4882.23s]  Okay, let's keep going.
[4882.23s -> 4885.19s]  All right, the grass here is strewn with rubble and rocks,
[4885.19s -> 4886.90s]  which make the going difficult.
[4886.90s -> 4888.78s]  The blocks have fallen from the outer wall
[4888.78s -> 4891.93s]  and a sheer drop beckons to the west.
[4891.93s -> 4893.96s]  Search the stones.
[4893.96s -> 4898.78s]  You search through and around the stones.
[4898.78s -> 4899.98s]  Eventually you come across something,
[4899.98s -> 4903.58s]  a human arm bone underneath one large block.
[4903.58s -> 4904.98s]  Presumably this is unfortunate.
[4904.98s -> 4909.20s]  It was standing below the wall when it fell.
[4909.20s -> 4911.82s]  Uh, move back from the edge.
[4911.82s -> 4916.60s]  I'm not messing with that.
[4916.60s -> 4922.01s]  I guess I could jump off.
[4922.01s -> 4927.23s]  You walk on through the field of wheat.
[4927.23s -> 4930.81s]  Um, is anything out here?
[4930.81s -> 4931.85s]  I'm gonna check.
[4931.85s -> 4934.62s]  I feel like there probably is.
[4934.62s -> 4937.06s]  You stride onwards through the tall swaying stems.
[4937.06s -> 4938.51s]  Then suddenly you stop.
[4938.51s -> 4944.86s]  You have seen a prone form lying in the grass up ahead.
[4944.90s -> 4948.83s]  Somebody's proning, looking at me.
[4948.83s -> 4950.27s]  Have you ever had an unripe avocado?
[4950.27s -> 4955.02s]  Yeah, yeah, it's always a painful experience
[4955.02s -> 4956.66s]  when you're like, is it ready?
[4956.66s -> 4964.62s]  You open it, fuck, it's not.
[4964.62s -> 4974.18s]  Oh, I'm gonna read this thing's mind.
[4974.18s -> 4980.60s]  You gotta become an avocado whisperer.
[4980.60s -> 4984.09s]  It's not ready.
[4984.09s -> 4988.64s]  That's funny, if I pick an avocado, it's awful.
[4988.64s -> 4992.78s]  Holly picks an avocado, it's great.
[4992.78s -> 4993.78s]  I can't do it.
[4993.78s -> 5002.84s]  I can't do it, every time I've tried.
[5002.84s -> 5007.86s]  Avocado salsa tastes like radioactive waste.
[5008.50s -> 5012.32s]  No, it does not.
[5012.32s -> 5015.33s]  What do you, no, what?
[5015.33s -> 5017.09s]  I'm seeing a lot of trues right now,
[5017.09s -> 5018.94s]  and I have to disagree.
[5018.94s -> 5022.90s]  Wait, what do you mean, avocado salsa?
[5022.90s -> 5024.73s]  You mean guacamole.
[5024.73s -> 5026.73s]  Talking about guacamole, you mean like salsa that's,
[5026.73s -> 5031.14s]  what do you mean?
[5031.14s -> 5032.86s]  Guacamole's great.
[5032.86s -> 5034.82s]  I, you know what, I didn't really like guacamole
[5034.82s -> 5039.51s]  until like five years ago.
[5039.51s -> 5043.44s]  I like a chunky guacamole.
[5043.44s -> 5046.34s]  I don't like smooth guacamole, it's too pasty.
[5046.34s -> 5050.91s]  But big, chunky avocados in the guac,
[5050.91s -> 5051.79s]  that's where you got me.
[5051.83s -> 5057.03s]  Now I'm there, I'm excited.
[5057.03s -> 5058.91s]  What would you name your first child?
[5058.91s -> 5060.70s]  Bill.
[5060.70s -> 5063.55s]  Okay, you weave the spell pulling on the cloth, let's see.
[5063.55s -> 5065.71s]  Thoughts rise up from the sleeping figure.
[5065.71s -> 5067.55s]  It is dreaming of scratching its nose.
[5067.55s -> 5073.02s]  Okay, this is, person's asleep.
[5073.02s -> 5075.78s]  Poor kid, what's wrong with Bill?
[5075.78s -> 5077.06s]  You got a problem with Bill?
[5077.06s -> 5080.02s]  You got a problem with Bill, the name Bill?
[5080.02s -> 5083.05s]  How many Bills in here just got fucking pissed at you?
[5083.05s -> 5085.65s]  How many Williams are here right now
[5085.65s -> 5087.41s]  that are like, excuse me?
[5087.41s -> 5089.25s]  Why are they truing this?
[5089.25s -> 5099.53s]  Yeah, what the hell's going on here?
[5103.54s -> 5104.90s]  Bill is an epic name.
[5104.90s -> 5108.85s]  Yeah, thanks.
[5108.85s -> 5111.45s]  Okay, we're not gonna talk about food.
[5111.45s -> 5112.93s]  We're not gonna talk about Bill.
[5112.93s -> 5116.50s]  We're not gonna talk about Bill or food.
[5116.50s -> 5124.06s]  We're gonna play sorcery, okay?
[5124.06s -> 5134.37s]  You have another kid gonna be Ted, Bill and Ted.
[5134.37s -> 5136.01s]  Can I write it now?
[5136.01s -> 5139.46s]  Can I write it?
[5139.46s -> 5143.20s]  Okay, that's my reaction.
[5143.20s -> 5144.04s]  You know what I mean?
[5144.04s -> 5147.55s]  Like that's my, you guys do it, I'm gonna do it now.
[5147.55s -> 5151.93s]  Okay, let's go.
[5151.93s -> 5154.17s]  Okay, you weave the spell, okay, sleeping.
[5154.17s -> 5156.02s]  Let's keep listening.
[5156.02s -> 5159.01s]  You keep listening, the dream intensifies.
[5159.01s -> 5161.89s]  It is now cleaning the inside of its ear
[5161.89s -> 5165.05s]  and gently stroking across the top of its head.
[5165.05s -> 5172.34s]  Both actions are giving the creature ecstatic pleasure.
[5172.34s -> 5175.34s]  You remove the skull cap, feeling somewhat sullied
[5175.34s -> 5178.50s]  and the spell fades.
[5178.50s -> 5183.46s]  What is going on?
[5183.46s -> 5185.39s]  Okay.
[5185.39s -> 5186.79s]  The figure is a strange creature
[5186.79s -> 5189.27s]  with long flat bladed arms.
[5189.27s -> 5190.95s]  A little like the curious farmers you saw
[5190.95s -> 5192.78s]  in the fields of Lowakari.
[5192.78s -> 5194.58s]  The figure is fast asleep,
[5194.62s -> 5197.78s]  an empty wine skin by its side.
[5197.78s -> 5198.74s]  Should I go up and wake the figure?
[5198.74s -> 5200.13s]  I'm waking him up.
[5200.13s -> 5201.53s]  You shake the figure on the shoulder
[5201.53s -> 5202.89s]  until it opens its eyes.
[5202.89s -> 5207.04s]  Instead of yawning, it lets out a series of small chirps.
[5208.04s -> 5208.88s]  You're right.
[5210.32s -> 5211.60s]  I should probably get back to work.
[5211.60s -> 5214.04s]  Was that a bird or an ape?
[5214.04s -> 5216.76s]  Who knows?
[5216.76s -> 5219.58s]  You look over the creature and it stares back at you.
[5219.58s -> 5223.34s]  Large teeth barred in what might be a smile.
[5223.34s -> 5225.80s]  Its eyes are glossy like an insect's
[5225.80s -> 5231.78s]  and you see a harsh reflection of yourself in them.
[5231.82s -> 5233.70s]  Who are you?
[5233.70s -> 5236.95s]  What an odd question.
[5236.95s -> 5239.01s]  I'm me.
[5239.01s -> 5241.37s]  As you speak, the creature idly shaves off
[5241.37s -> 5244.74s]  some grass with a blade.
[5244.74s -> 5246.28s]  Where are you from?
[5246.28s -> 5247.90s]  Are you natural?
[5247.90s -> 5249.82s]  Do you live in this field?
[5249.82s -> 5252.20s]  You live here.
[5252.20s -> 5254.40s]  I usually sleep here,
[5254.40s -> 5256.56s]  but sometimes I sleep closer to the market
[5256.56s -> 5259.95s]  where I get some food.
[5259.95s -> 5261.55s]  Are you given a wage?
[5261.55s -> 5263.44s]  You ask puzzled.
[5263.44s -> 5267.45s]  A woman gives me apples and water in exchange for my wheat.
[5267.45s -> 5271.46s]  This conversation is oddly like talking to a plant.
[5271.46s -> 5276.93s]  Are you from here?
[5277.85s -> 5281.52s]  I have always lived in this field.
[5281.52s -> 5282.56s]  What a coincidence.
[5282.56s -> 5283.68s]  Me too.
[5283.68s -> 5285.48s]  The creature beams up and sits up.
[5285.48s -> 5287.48s]  Oh, it's so nice to sit with a human.
[5287.48s -> 5290.76s]  Most avoid the fields or spit at me and call me a name.
[5290.76s -> 5293.08s]  Now, what is it?
[5293.08s -> 5294.90s]  What is it?
[5294.90s -> 5298.75s]  Freak, mutant, friend.
[5298.75s -> 5300.60s]  Friend?
[5300.60s -> 5302.51s]  Friend.
[5302.51s -> 5305.07s]  I've never heard that word before.
[5305.07s -> 5312.15s]  And he picks his nose with the blade tip.
[5312.15s -> 5314.56s]  I think the Archmage made you.
[5314.56s -> 5316.45s]  Perhaps it is a jest.
[5316.45s -> 5318.89s]  Has the Archmage been selling your type to Kare?
[5321.93s -> 5322.97s]  We'll go to the middle.
[5322.97s -> 5325.99s]  Perhaps it is a jest.
[5325.99s -> 5328.07s]  They usually don't stay around long enough
[5328.07s -> 5329.03s]  for me to find out,
[5329.03s -> 5331.86s]  but they are laughing as they say it.
[5331.86s -> 5334.55s]  The creature bows its head to you.
[5334.55s -> 5339.03s]  Not every day I get to spend time with a human.
[5339.03s -> 5340.91s]  Few come by here and most ignore me.
[5342.19s -> 5351.94s]  Perhaps, could we play a game of swindle stones or a drink?
[5351.94s -> 5357.19s]  How about a drink?
[5357.19s -> 5363.23s]  Swindle stones?
[5363.23s -> 5368.20s]  It's been a while since we played swindle stones.
[5368.20s -> 5374.22s]  The farmer counts out four dice each and takes first bid.
[5374.22s -> 5375.06s]  Okay.
[5375.06s -> 5381.14s]  So four each.
[5381.14s -> 5381.98s]  Okay.
[5381.98s -> 5384.18s]  I got to remember everything about this game.
[5384.18s -> 5385.06s]  Where do you live?
[5385.06s -> 5386.80s]  Near the market?
[5386.80s -> 5387.64s]  Okay.
[5387.64s -> 5389.98s]  So I have to, I'm going to say use one.
[5389.98s -> 5391.95s]  That means you have one.
[5391.95s -> 5392.79s]  Okay.
[5392.79s -> 5394.93s]  Then let's go with three ones.
[5394.93s -> 5400.62s]  No.
[5400.62s -> 5402.74s]  If he calls that, it's going to be real.
[5402.74s -> 5406.20s]  Should I say four ones?
[5406.20s -> 5408.04s]  There are four, four ones.
[5408.04s -> 5410.56s]  What do you think about that?
[5410.56s -> 5411.40s]  Call it.
[5411.40s -> 5412.24s]  Good.
[5412.24s -> 5415.42s]  You have one.
[5415.42s -> 5416.26s]  Call it.
[5416.26s -> 5419.83s]  You didn't even have, what?
[5422.82s -> 5431.17s]  You had three twos and he's calling out ones.
[5431.17s -> 5433.05s]  How is he rolling the dice?
[5433.05s -> 5433.89s]  A good question.
[5433.89s -> 5435.48s]  Okay.
[5435.48s -> 5444.59s]  There is, there are two twos.
[5444.59s -> 5448.02s]  There are three ones?
[5448.02s -> 5448.86s]  Shit.
[5448.86s -> 5454.94s]  That might be accurate.
[5454.94s -> 5465.51s]  Do I dare say four?
[5465.51s -> 5466.35s]  Should I say three?
[5466.35s -> 5467.75s]  No.
[5467.75s -> 5478.50s]  I think he's got me again.
[5478.50s -> 5479.34s]  He got me again.
[5479.34s -> 5480.18s]  I'm rusty.
[5480.18s -> 5489.67s]  I haven't played in like a year.
[5489.67s -> 5491.22s]  Two twos.
[5491.22s -> 5492.06s]  Fuck.
[5492.06s -> 5492.90s]  How, okay.
[5492.90s -> 5493.74s]  Can he see?
[5493.74s -> 5494.58s]  How can he see mine?
[5494.58s -> 5499.37s]  That's, he keeps getting the ones that I have.
[5499.37s -> 5501.18s]  What about two fives?
[5501.18s -> 5506.67s]  Or two fours?
[5506.67s -> 5507.51s]  All right.
[5507.51s -> 5509.53s]  If you have one five that I get it.
[5509.53s -> 5510.37s]  I mean, one four.
[5510.37s -> 5512.84s]  What?
[5512.84s -> 5515.28s]  How do you not have one?
[5515.28s -> 5520.35s]  This, this guy's crazy at this game.
[5520.35s -> 5524.26s]  I can't even rewind.
[5524.26s -> 5525.86s]  I got screwed so bad.
[5525.86s -> 5528.50s]  Me having three ones and him having three twos.
[5528.50s -> 5529.34s]  And he says there are,
[5529.34s -> 5530.78s]  he's calling out ones in the beginning.
[5530.78s -> 5535.50s]  That fucked up the whole thing.
[5535.50s -> 5536.34s]  I'm just going to make it up.
[5536.34s -> 5542.70s]  I have one one, two twos.
[5542.70s -> 5543.54s]  Okay.
[5543.54s -> 5545.24s]  You have to have those.
[5545.24s -> 5547.04s]  So should I just call him?
[5547.04s -> 5551.35s]  That means he has to have two twos.
[5551.35s -> 5552.47s]  Do I dare tell?
[5552.47s -> 5553.68s]  No.
[5553.68s -> 5554.89s]  I have to call it.
[5554.89s -> 5558.14s]  I have to.
[5558.70s -> 5562.78s]  He's making this up or I mean, we lose anyways.
[5562.78s -> 5563.62s]  Yeah.
[5563.62s -> 5566.36s]  Call it out.
[5566.36s -> 5567.20s]  Of course.
[5567.20s -> 5570.32s]  This guy's hands have been fucking disgusting, by the way.
[5570.32s -> 5575.18s]  These are disgusting hands to get.
[5575.18s -> 5579.32s]  Just absolutely disgusting hands.
[5579.32s -> 5586.58s]  Let's play again.
[5586.58s -> 5587.42s]  Okay.
[5587.42s -> 5588.70s]  That's a, this is good.
[5588.70s -> 5589.54s]  There are two twos.
[5589.54s -> 5590.38s]  Really?
[5590.38s -> 5591.22s]  You think there are?
[5591.22s -> 5594.70s]  I think there are three twos.
[5594.70s -> 5595.71s]  Call it.
[5595.71s -> 5605.99s]  Four twos.
[5605.99s -> 5607.15s]  Is he lying again?
[5607.15s -> 5608.15s]  He's lying again.
[5608.15s -> 5610.40s]  You don't have two.
[5610.40s -> 5616.92s]  What the fuck?
[5616.92s -> 5618.40s]  Yeah, but if I said five twos,
[5618.40s -> 5621.74s]  he would call it and I would lose anyways.
[5621.74s -> 5629.10s]  Cause he knows.
[5629.10s -> 5634.66s]  Let's go with two of these.
[5634.66s -> 5635.50s]  Just two.
[5635.50s -> 5636.34s]  What about just two ones?
[5636.34s -> 5637.18s]  Something I don't have.
[5637.18s -> 5640.43s]  Two ones.
[5640.43s -> 5644.37s]  Oh, is he cheating?
[5644.37s -> 5647.70s]  I think he's cheating.
[5647.70s -> 5656.95s]  This guy's cheating.
[5656.95s -> 5659.18s]  He's cheating.
[5659.18s -> 5660.02s]  He's gotten this.
[5660.02s -> 5669.42s]  He's known what I've had in my hand every time.
[5669.42s -> 5672.40s]  I'm going to say there are four of those
[5672.40s -> 5674.16s]  because I don't know why you would say that
[5674.16s -> 5677.32s]  if you didn't think you had at least two of them.
[5677.32s -> 5680.90s]  Call it.
[5680.90s -> 5685.22s]  What the fuck?
[5685.22s -> 5690.71s]  That means you have almost three fours are in your hand?
[5693.26s -> 5695.36s]  No.
[5695.36s -> 5704.54s]  This game, he's cheating.
[5704.54s -> 5705.38s]  See, look, he's got,
[5705.38s -> 5708.30s]  how can he see what he knows what I have?
[5708.30s -> 5709.14s]  All right.
[5709.14s -> 5709.98s]  I'm going three.
[5709.98s -> 5710.82s]  No, you know what?
[5710.82s -> 5712.59s]  Fuck you.
[5712.59s -> 5715.76s]  Four twos.
[5715.76s -> 5718.15s]  Oh, you think there are five twos?
[5718.15s -> 5719.37s]  There are not.
[5719.37s -> 5723.01s]  Sorry.
[5723.01s -> 5726.45s]  Here comes a comeback.
[5726.45s -> 5727.29s]  You need to relax.
[5727.29s -> 5729.33s]  It's just a game.
[5729.33s -> 5730.41s]  Stick to talking about fruits.
[5730.41s -> 5735.32s]  You're not very good at this.
[5735.32s -> 5736.36s]  Hey, I'm a little rusty.
[5736.36s -> 5737.90s]  I'm doing fine.
[5737.90s -> 5738.74s]  All right, this is good.
[5738.74s -> 5739.58s]  This is good.
[5739.58s -> 5740.66s]  This is huge.
[5740.66s -> 5741.50s]  This is a huge deal.
[5741.50s -> 5745.19s]  If I start out with two threes,
[5745.19s -> 5746.95s]  okay, I'm going to say two threes.
[5746.95s -> 5747.99s]  That's going to ruin everything
[5747.99s -> 5762.78s]  because now he's going to say three threes.
[5762.78s -> 5771.56s]  He's cheating.
[5771.56s -> 5775.75s]  There are two ones because I have one of them.
[5775.75s -> 5781.26s]  Hmm.
[5781.26s -> 5782.86s]  This is fucked up.
[5782.86s -> 5783.70s]  I'm sorry.
[5783.70s -> 5784.54s]  This is the best,
[5784.54s -> 5788.26s]  like the most ridiculous little stones I've ever played.
[5788.26s -> 5790.62s]  This is actually cheating.
[5790.62s -> 5792.16s]  Game over.
[5792.16s -> 5793.28s]  The farmer shrugs.
[5793.28s -> 5795.28s]  It is rather hard for me to roll, you see,
[5795.28s -> 5796.56s]  but I do enjoy it.
[5796.56s -> 5806.63s]  But another?
[5806.63s -> 5814.75s]  How about one one?
[5814.75s -> 5817.82s]  Two twos.
[5817.82s -> 5819.02s]  Three ones.
[5819.02s -> 5821.26s]  Oh, you piece of shit.
[5821.26s -> 5824.94s]  Okay, he probably has two.
[5824.94s -> 5827.82s]  I don't think I can call him on that.
[5827.82s -> 5831.30s]  I'm going to say there are three threes.
[5831.30s -> 5832.14s]  I have two.
[5832.14s -> 5835.46s]  He just needs one.
[5835.46s -> 5836.30s]  Reveal it.
[5836.30s -> 5837.14s]  You definitely have one.
[5837.14s -> 5853.00s]  Show your hand.
[5853.00s -> 5855.81s]  Two threes.
[5855.81s -> 5857.13s]  Three twos.
[5857.13s -> 5858.53s]  He knows what I have.
[5858.53s -> 5859.37s]  He's cheating.
[5859.37s -> 5878.74s]  He's literally cheating.
[5878.74s -> 5880.68s]  You bad at bluffing?
[5880.68s -> 5882.92s]  This isn't a real guy.
[5882.92s -> 5886.94s]  I can't bluff a fake person.
[5886.94s -> 5894.69s]  He's got computer knowledge in here of him cheating.
[5894.69s -> 5900.54s]  I'm just going to say something crazy.
[5900.54s -> 5902.10s]  I mean, I'm just going to call it
[5902.10s -> 5905.38s]  because it's very high that he has two twos,
[5905.38s -> 5907.00s]  but what am I going to do?
[5907.00s -> 5907.84s]  Yeah.
[5907.84s -> 5916.56s]  Got two twos and two ones.
[5916.56s -> 5917.52s]  One.
[5917.52s -> 5922.38s]  Okay.
[5922.38s -> 5925.43s]  There are two of those.
[5925.43s -> 5926.74s]  I'll say three.
[5926.74s -> 5927.58s]  He's cheating.
[5927.58s -> 5929.90s]  I've played this game a thousand times.
[5929.90s -> 5932.38s]  This guy's not, this is, he's cheating.
[5932.38s -> 5933.38s]  Hey, watch this.
[5933.38s -> 5934.22s]  Watch this.
[5934.22s -> 5935.06s]  I'm going to, and he's going to be like,
[5935.06s -> 5937.98s]  oh, by the way, thanks for showing me all those twos.
[5937.98s -> 5938.94s]  And I'm going to get the opportunity
[5938.94s -> 5941.02s]  to shoot a lightning bolt in his head.
[5941.02s -> 5943.02s]  I'm just telling you what the game is going to do for us.
[5943.02s -> 5949.10s]  It's going to, that's what's going to be presented to us.
[5949.10s -> 5953.59s]  Oh, there are two ones.
[5953.59s -> 5954.43s]  Two twos.
[5955.23s -> 5957.24s]  Get out of here with this shit.
[5957.24s -> 5963.25s]  Get out of here with this.
[5963.25s -> 5965.48s]  I'm going to try it one more time.
[5965.48s -> 5966.32s]  Oh, I do love this.
[5966.32s -> 5968.80s]  He's probably stealing shit from me while he cheats.
[5968.80s -> 5971.04s]  I don't even care because I have to beat the cheater.
[5971.04s -> 5974.63s]  I have to beat the cheater.
[5974.63s -> 5975.47s]  Two twos.
[5975.47s -> 5976.31s]  Yeah.
[5976.31s -> 5980.56s]  I wonder why.
[5980.56s -> 5981.40s]  You know what?
[5981.40s -> 5984.20s]  Let's go, let's just go with four twos.
[5984.20s -> 5985.04s]  Four twos.
[5985.04s -> 5986.31s]  What are you going to do about it?
[5986.31s -> 5987.15s]  Okay.
[5987.15s -> 5991.34s]  Well, you, you're a liar.
[5991.34s -> 6004.69s]  This motherfucker, I swear to God.
[6004.69s -> 6007.15s]  How about just one?
[6007.15s -> 6009.72s]  One.
[6009.72s -> 6011.33s]  One five.
[6011.33s -> 6014.58s]  One four.
[6014.58s -> 6024.85s]  Two fours.
[6024.85s -> 6026.29s]  Three threes.
[6026.29s -> 6028.08s]  You might have one.
[6028.76s -> 6032.38s]  Oh, okay.
[6032.38s -> 6036.54s]  So that means you have two.
[6036.54s -> 6043.51s]  I don't think you do.
[6043.51s -> 6048.19s]  I mean, you probably have two.
[6048.19s -> 6049.67s]  He gets two of these every time.
[6049.67s -> 6051.67s]  And then he, he always calls.
[6051.67s -> 6052.51s]  He always says,
[6052.51s -> 6055.64s]  hey, what about the exact thing that you have?
[6055.64s -> 6056.48s]  Yeah.
[6056.48s -> 6057.32s]  All right.
[6057.32s -> 6058.16s]  All right.
[6058.16s -> 6059.50s]  I am.
[6059.50s -> 6060.34s]  All right.
[6060.34s -> 6061.18s]  I'm zapping this guy.
[6061.18s -> 6067.89s]  I don't care what I get for it.
[6067.89s -> 6069.15s]  Three twos.
[6069.15s -> 6069.99s]  Yeah.
[6069.99s -> 6077.88s]  Cause, cause you screwed me over.
[6077.88s -> 6084.10s]  I can't win like this.
[6084.10s -> 6085.60s]  Two twos.
[6085.60s -> 6086.44s]  All right.
[6086.44s -> 6087.87s]  How about three twos?
[6087.87s -> 6093.94s]  I mean, three ones.
[6093.98s -> 6094.82s]  Let me guess.
[6094.82s -> 6098.54s]  He's going to have one this time.
[6098.54s -> 6100.14s]  Oh, when you can, when you can't,
[6100.14s -> 6102.42s]  when you can only mess with one die,
[6102.42s -> 6106.16s]  it's not so easy, is it?
[6106.16s -> 6107.00s]  Well, okay.
[6107.00s -> 6108.44s]  If you, you have one, one.
[6108.44s -> 6109.28s]  All right.
[6109.28s -> 6110.88s]  So let's go with two.
[6110.88s -> 6111.96s]  I'll throw this right back at you.
[6111.96s -> 6120.59s]  Let's go.
[6120.59s -> 6122.70s]  Okay.
[6122.70s -> 6131.34s]  Somehow I'm clawing this back.
[6131.34s -> 6132.18s]  Okay.
[6132.18s -> 6136.98s]  There's one, one, two.
[6136.98s -> 6137.82s]  Okay.
[6137.82s -> 6139.46s]  You have to have two fours,
[6139.46s -> 6143.18s]  which is there's no way.
[6143.18s -> 6155.06s]  Oh my God.
[6155.06s -> 6157.16s]  Cheating.
[6157.16s -> 6158.36s]  The farmer offers you an apple
[6158.36s -> 6164.23s]  as a token of appreciation.
[6164.23s -> 6166.51s]  The creature offers you a dark purple drink,
[6166.51s -> 6168.35s]  which it insists is simply water.
[6168.35s -> 6170.30s]  It smells awful.
[6170.30s -> 6180.89s]  Why would I drink this?
[6180.89s -> 6181.77s]  You take a drink.
[6181.77s -> 6183.57s]  It tastes like the sewers beneath Carré,
[6183.57s -> 6186.76s]  but afterwards you feel strangely refreshed.
[6186.76s -> 6188.92s]  I am very careful about what I drink.
[6188.92s -> 6190.80s]  No ale or strange potions.
[6190.80s -> 6194.50s]  Only pure water for me.
[6194.50s -> 6196.10s]  You elect to keep going.
[6196.10s -> 6197.94s]  The farming creature nods to you,
[6197.94s -> 6200.04s]  then scurries away across the grass.
[6200.04s -> 6209.79s]  The air stirs a little cold, but fresh.
[6209.79s -> 6214.97s]  Fuck that guy.
[6214.97s -> 6216.86s]  You pace on through the long grass.
[6217.22s -> 6218.46s]  The stalks nearby shiver.
[6218.46s -> 6221.77s]  And then the snake you saw earlier bursts up.
[6221.77s -> 6224.53s]  You twist away as it rears up and goes for your neck
[6224.53s -> 6227.41s]  and your blade is out before it can disappear again.
[6227.41s -> 6230.07s]  And you track it with hawk eyes.
[6230.07s -> 6232.75s]  But you have fought larger serpents than this one.
[6232.75s -> 6235.54s]  I'm going to burp.
[6235.54s -> 6241.54s]  Oh, can I talk?
[6241.54s -> 6243.14s]  You always tried the talk, right?
[6246.94s -> 6250.10s]  It's rap, right?
[6250.10s -> 6254.40s]  Sharpen.
[6254.40s -> 6256.28s]  Zap is probably going to light the whole field on fire,
[6256.28s -> 6259.40s]  which I don't want to do.
[6259.40s -> 6261.06s]  Ooh.
[6261.06s -> 6261.90s]  Law.
[6261.90s -> 6263.18s]  Control non-intelligent creatures.
[6263.94s -> 6267.65s]  Is a snake smart?
[6267.65s -> 6271.58s]  Find out.
[6271.58s -> 6273.42s]  Insulting the stars, you bind the magic.
[6273.42s -> 6275.62s]  The creature stops in its track.
[6275.62s -> 6277.66s]  Its will now bent to yours.
[6281.66s -> 6283.50s]  Should I kill it?
[6283.50s -> 6286.23s]  I'm going to send it away.
[6286.23s -> 6289.31s]  In a moment of conscience, you send the creature away.
[6289.31s -> 6293.31s]  Your grip on its mind fades as it escapes into the grass.
[6293.31s -> 6297.00s]  The grass waves and wafts around your feet.
[6297.00s -> 6300.00s]  This could be a bucolic paradise
[6300.00s -> 6301.84s]  if it wasn't for the looming ghoul
[6301.84s -> 6303.99s]  of the sorcerer's spike to the east.
[6304.03s -> 6308.80s]  A few clouds drift across the sky.
[6309.76s -> 6315.12s]  Should I just keep going?
[6315.12s -> 6316.64s]  You move onwards through the field of wheat.
[6316.64s -> 6319.52s]  You almost trip over a half-rotten tree stump
[6319.52s -> 6321.38s]  lost in the long grasses.
[6321.38s -> 6324.71s]  A low murmuring comes from inside the ancient wood.
[6324.71s -> 6326.69s]  Is somebody in the tree?
[6326.69s -> 6328.62s]  You squat down and peer at the stump.
[6328.62s -> 6330.50s]  A bee crawls from a crack in the wood
[6330.50s -> 6334.09s]  and takes off into the air as you watch.
[6335.88s -> 6342.32s]  Why would I split open the beehive?
[6342.32s -> 6348.91s]  Fucking starlight kid bucolic kid.
[6348.91s -> 6351.82s]  Do it for science.
[6351.82s -> 6353.90s]  With your sword, you pry open a section of the wood
[6353.90s -> 6358.10s]  and a hundred bees spill out in a sudden angry swarm.
[6358.10s -> 6360.14s]  They whip around in furious clouds
[6360.14s -> 6363.33s]  searching for their attacker.
[6363.33s -> 6367.62s]  Ah, run from bees.
[6367.62s -> 6369.62s]  I'm the Archmage of Mampang.
[6369.62s -> 6371.74s]  I know there's an assassin to come and get me.
[6371.74s -> 6374.90s]  I know he's tracking through the universe to find me.
[6374.90s -> 6378.14s]  Who's that out there in the weeds out there in the wheat?
[6378.14s -> 6379.10s]  Is that Frank out there?
[6379.10s -> 6380.84s]  No, who's that?
[6380.84s -> 6382.28s]  No being swarmed by bees.
[6382.28s -> 6383.28s]  That's my attacker.
[6383.28s -> 6384.12s]  Oh, okay.
[6384.12s -> 6389.98s]  I'm in deep trouble.
[6389.98s -> 6390.98s]  I think I'll be fine.
[6390.98s -> 6395.78s]  In fact, I'm gonna keep the windows open.
[6395.78s -> 6401.07s]  Um, I'm just gonna look in the trunk.
[6401.07s -> 6402.95s]  You swat away the swarm as best you can
[6402.95s -> 6404.79s]  to look inside the trunk
[6404.79s -> 6407.98s]  where you can see a huge supply of beeswax.
[6407.98s -> 6410.46s]  The bees seize their chance to surround you.
[6410.46s -> 6413.14s]  You fall but stagger quickly back to your feet.
[6413.14s -> 6416.66s]  The stings are oversized like the plants here
[6416.66s -> 6418.82s]  and you feel the poison causing stiffness
[6418.82s -> 6420.90s]  and rictus in your body.
[6420.90s -> 6423.38s]  You must keep moving.
[6423.38s -> 6426.16s]  Reach in and get some beeswax.
[6426.16s -> 6428.56s]  You scoop out several handfuls of beeswax,
[6428.56s -> 6432.14s]  enough for six or seven spell castings,
[6432.14s -> 6433.74s]  but the slightest hesitancy
[6433.74s -> 6435.70s]  is enough for the bees to catch you.
[6435.70s -> 6437.30s]  You gasp with pain.
[6437.30s -> 6438.62s]  There is no time to waste.
[6438.62s -> 6439.96s]  Run.
[6439.96s -> 6442.25s]  The bees are right behind you.
[6442.25s -> 6444.69s]  You open your arms to cast a spell and the bees attack.
[6444.69s -> 6446.65s]  You fall but scramble quickly to your feet.
[6446.65s -> 6450.66s]  You must keep moving.
[6450.66s -> 6452.63s]  Uh-oh.
[6452.63s -> 6455.26s]  I have to go this way.
[6455.26s -> 6458.10s]  You run forward, the swarm hot on your heels
[6458.10s -> 6461.43s]  and the swarm of bees catches you stinging viciously.
[6461.43s -> 6463.71s]  You gasp and bat at them furiously.
[6463.71s -> 6464.91s]  You wail with pain.
[6464.91s -> 6466.39s]  You cannot take much more of this.
[6467.15s -> 6470.82s]  There is no time to waste.
[6470.82s -> 6473.66s]  The bees do not slow or stop as you rush forward.
[6473.66s -> 6475.94s]  You stand in the shadow of the inner wall by a heavy metal
[6475.94s -> 6478.13s]  door, the door is closed.
[6478.13s -> 6479.53s]  Open the door.
[6479.53s -> 6484.16s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[6484.16s -> 6487.12s]  You try for the door and find it open but stiff.
[6487.12s -> 6488.60s]  The bees reach you.
[6488.60s -> 6492.45s]  The impact of a hundred stings is too much for you.
[6492.45s -> 6503.50s]  You succumb to the sound of a hundred furious bees.
[6503.50s -> 6508.74s]  But then, after some time, you awaken.
[6508.74s -> 6511.50s]  The sun disappears heading towards the horizon.
[6511.50s -> 6514.94s]  You ache all over.
[6514.94s -> 6517.74s]  Where am I?
[6518.50s -> 6519.34s]  You lift your head.
[6519.34s -> 6521.06s]  You're lying on a pallet.
[6521.06s -> 6522.72s]  Be careful.
[6522.72s -> 6528.23s]  You were very badly wounded before we carried you here.
[6528.23s -> 6530.65s]  Who are you?
[6530.65s -> 6532.81s]  We're a friendly order.
[6532.81s -> 6534.67s]  Rest now.
[6534.67s -> 6537.07s]  The figure bows its head and slips you away.
[6537.07s -> 6542.51s]  You pass out once more.
[6542.51s -> 6544.02s]  Night has fallen.
[6544.02s -> 6546.14s]  You need to rest, especially on an empty stomach.
[6546.14s -> 6547.06s]  More time passes.
[6547.06s -> 6549.89s]  How long have you been here?
[6549.89s -> 6551.93s]  Get up.
[6551.93s -> 6553.51s]  You struggle to your feet.
[6553.51s -> 6557.15s]  You're in a monastery, it would seem, in a dormitory.
[6557.15s -> 6558.07s]  You make your way slowly,
[6558.07s -> 6563.56s]  staggering up a short flight of stairs.
[6563.56s -> 6566.65s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[6566.65s -> 6569.82s]  I, uh, I thought we were in the larder.
[6569.82s -> 6571.38s]  I thought we were that other person.
[6571.38s -> 6572.38s]  Sorry about that.
[6572.38s -> 6579.17s]  Changing voice now.
[6579.17s -> 6582.28s]  Sorry about that.
[6582.28s -> 6585.84s]  Your footsteps echo on the cool stone floor.
[6585.84s -> 6587.56s]  As you emerge into a wide hall,
[6587.56s -> 6594.26s]  pews line one side, and an altar is in the corner.
[6594.26s -> 6595.87s]  Let's rest.
[6595.87s -> 6597.83s]  You take a moment to rest on one of the stone benches.
[6597.83s -> 6599.23s]  It is a peaceful spot,
[6599.23s -> 6601.98s]  perhaps the most peaceful in all of Mampang.
[6601.98s -> 6604.38s]  All is quiet in the chamber.
[6604.38s -> 6606.06s]  You could explore the monastery further,
[6606.06s -> 6609.41s]  or go out into the streets.
[6609.41s -> 6614.62s]  I think we're gonna explore.
[6614.62s -> 6617.35s]  Uh, how about back in the dormitory?
[6617.35s -> 6618.19s]  Sorry, I didn't die.
[6618.19s -> 6620.68s]  That's cool.
[6620.68s -> 6621.84s]  You head down a short flight of steps
[6621.84s -> 6624.12s]  into the dormitory's unseen.
[6624.12s -> 6625.64s]  You're back in the dormitory
[6625.64s -> 6627.64s]  where you nursed back to life
[6627.64s -> 6629.93s]  after your encounter with the bees.
[6629.93s -> 6633.21s]  The cots are filled with sleeping bodies.
[6633.21s -> 6637.30s]  Should I go back to sleep?
[6637.30s -> 6640.28s]  Look at the monk's habits.
[6640.28s -> 6642.92s]  One of the habits looks to be your size.
[6642.92s -> 6646.98s]  It has a large hood which will hide your face well.
[6646.98s -> 6648.38s]  Put it on.
[6648.38s -> 6650.10s]  You gather up the monk's concealing habit
[6650.10s -> 6653.22s]  and quickly pull it on.
[6653.22s -> 6656.35s]  Disguise.
[6656.35s -> 6658.35s]  You will now pass as a monk.
[6658.35s -> 6661.67s]  A sense of great calm descends upon you.
[6661.67s -> 6664.22s]  Sleep.
[6664.22s -> 6666.90s]  Trusting that your habit will keep you out of trouble,
[6666.90s -> 6668.78s]  you stretch out on a berth.
[6668.78s -> 6669.74s]  Laying your pack down,
[6669.74s -> 6671.18s]  you try to stretch out under your habit
[6671.18s -> 6673.18s]  despite the uncomfortable floor.
[6673.18s -> 6674.78s]  You've not eaten today, but I do have food.
[6674.78s -> 6677.83s]  How?
[6677.83s -> 6679.31s]  Oh, the apple!
[6679.31s -> 6680.47s]  That's right.
[6680.47s -> 6683.70s]  I forgot.
[6683.70s -> 6684.86s]  Taking the apple from your pack,
[6684.86s -> 6686.42s]  you fill your empty stomach
[6686.42s -> 6689.50s]  and try not to think about what you will eat tomorrow.
[6689.50s -> 6691.62s]  Then you lie back and try to forget your troubles.
[6691.62s -> 6695.38s]  You feel quite safe and you do not dream.
[6695.38s -> 6697.30s]  All right, we're back.
[6697.30s -> 6702.19s]  We're good.
[6702.19s -> 6703.31s]  I was gonna kill that guy too.
[6703.31s -> 6705.46s]  Thanks for the apple.
[6705.46s -> 6709.10s]  You entered the monastery of Effie the Fortuitous,
[6709.10s -> 6712.96s]  disguised yourself as a monk and found no new clues.
[6712.96s -> 6717.61s]  Still unaware, which is good.
[6717.61s -> 6720.13s]  You wake refreshed, then sit bolt upright
[6720.13s -> 6722.33s]  as you find six monks sitting around the bed,
[6722.33s -> 6724.13s]  washing you intently.
[6724.13s -> 6726.93s]  As your eyes open, one punches the air
[6726.93s -> 6728.71s]  and the other shakes their heads.
[6728.71s -> 6730.35s]  They exchange a few coins,
[6730.35s -> 6733.66s]  nod to you, and then move away.
[6733.66s -> 6735.14s]  With slow, solemn paces,
[6735.14s -> 6739.18s]  you make your way back up to the steps.
[6739.18s -> 6743.48s]  They're betting on if I was gonna wake up, I think.
[6743.48s -> 6744.92s]  Oh, I don't wanna spoil anything,
[6744.92s -> 6748.73s]  but this is a good part of the game.
[6748.73s -> 6750.90s]  You head back to the main chamber.
[6750.90s -> 6754.54s]  Chanting fills the space.
[6754.54s -> 6756.46s]  Listen to the singing.
[6756.46s -> 6758.62s]  You pause for a while to listen to the singing.
[6758.62s -> 6760.34s]  It is a strange tune.
[6761.30s -> 6762.78s]  Sometimes harmonious,
[6762.78s -> 6766.39s]  but at other times, horrifically atonal.
[6766.39s -> 6767.55s]  It is as though all the singers
[6767.55s -> 6769.43s]  are singing their own songs,
[6769.43s -> 6773.35s]  letting them coincide or conflict as luck would have it.
[6773.35s -> 6774.79s]  The effect is rather unsettling
[6774.79s -> 6776.78s]  and not especially pleasant.
[6776.78s -> 6779.98s]  Monks move this way and that about their business.
[6779.98s -> 6782.63s]  It's time to make a choice on where you would go.
[6782.63s -> 6788.98s]  Let's go on the altar.
[6788.98s -> 6791.46s]  You move closer to the altar and the pews.
[6791.46s -> 6793.64s]  Some kind of service is going on.
[6793.64s -> 6795.04s]  Monks are clustered in groups,
[6795.04s -> 6797.42s]  chanting in a slurring monotone.
[6797.46s -> 6799.86s]  A monk in bright red robes, the abbot,
[6799.86s -> 6802.58s]  stands with arms outstretched.
[6802.58s -> 6805.25s]  Let's watch the service.
[6805.25s -> 6806.89s]  You stand and watch the service.
[6806.89s -> 6808.62s]  The chanting is odd,
[6808.62s -> 6811.56s]  a droning buzz lacking discernible phrases.
[6811.56s -> 6813.96s]  You catch snatches of what might be words,
[6813.96s -> 6816.56s]  but they sound like a strange imitation of language.
[6816.56s -> 6817.72s]  Some monks are jovial,
[6817.72s -> 6820.08s]  whispering to each other and jostling,
[6820.08s -> 6822.18s]  but others are solemn.
[6822.18s -> 6823.14s]  Should we go back to bed?
[6823.14s -> 6826.15s]  Snooze.
[6826.15s -> 6827.35s]  I'm going back to sleep.
[6837.88s -> 6843.30s]  Create the illusion of worship.
[6843.34s -> 6845.22s]  I know you wrote so funny in all caps.
[6845.22s -> 6847.24s]  I know.
[6847.24s -> 6848.08s]  I know.
[6848.08s -> 6851.57s]  I'm not gonna do it.
[6851.57s -> 6858.79s]  I could teleport.
[6858.79s -> 6874.09s]  Should I just cause everybody to go to sleep?
[6874.09s -> 6875.37s]  It's not that I don't understand the language.
[6875.37s -> 6878.43s]  They're all just talking over each other.
[6878.43s -> 6885.02s]  Um, should I just make six of me?
[6885.02s -> 6889.14s]  I'm making six of me.
[6889.14s -> 6891.26s]  You gather the stars into your design around you
[6891.26s -> 6893.62s]  and five clones step out from behind you,
[6893.62s -> 6895.22s]  forming a semicircle.
[6895.22s -> 6899.19s]  The six of you sit side by side quietly.
[6899.19s -> 6902.03s]  See how our numbers have swelled,
[6902.03s -> 6904.66s]  the abbot declares as he looks around the room.
[6904.66s -> 6907.42s]  The abbot, his bright habit distinguishing him,
[6907.42s -> 6910.56s]  stands placidly at the front of the room.
[6910.56s -> 6912.28s]  The altar near him is covered in bronze,
[6912.28s -> 6914.30s]  its top battered and pitted.
[6914.30s -> 6917.22s]  Atop is a small bowl and a set of metal dice.
[6917.22s -> 6922.74s]  The chanting peters out and the abbot smiles.
[6922.74s -> 6927.07s]  Brothers and sisters, we give thanks to Effie.
[6927.07s -> 6932.27s]  We meditate on the changes and chances that fill our lives.
[6932.27s -> 6936.31s]  We give ourselves over to the dice roll, to the risk,
[6936.31s -> 6940.45s]  and let her nudge as she sees fit.
[6940.45s -> 6943.88s]  He gestures to a monk who approaches the altar.
[6943.88s -> 6949.01s]  Sister, it is your day to roll.
[6949.01s -> 6952.22s]  Wait, a monk approaches, grasps the dice,
[6952.22s -> 6955.06s]  and then tosses them across the altar with a clang.
[6955.06s -> 6959.03s]  The abbot considers the dice and tuts.
[6959.03s -> 6962.99s]  No luck for you, half rations for a day.
[6962.99s -> 6965.95s]  Think upon this chance.
[6965.95s -> 6968.35s]  Snooze.
[6968.35s -> 6970.83s]  There is a long stretch of chanting,
[6970.83s -> 6972.99s]  and then the service comes to an end.
[6972.99s -> 6974.79s]  The monks file out towards the gardens
[6974.79s -> 6976.63s]  or linger by the altar.
[6976.63s -> 6978.58s]  The echoes die away.
[6978.58s -> 6981.42s]  The monks stand and file away.
[6981.42s -> 6987.12s]  It's a gambler's den.
[6987.12s -> 6988.80s]  You step back to the doors once more.
[6988.80s -> 6992.32s]  One by one, your clones vanish.
[6992.32s -> 6994.34s]  So we just gassed that guy up.
[6994.34s -> 6997.96s]  That's all we did.
[6997.96s -> 7004.35s]  That guy thought they added six new people, okay?
[7004.35s -> 7005.95s]  Behind you, the ceremony comes to an end
[7005.95s -> 7009.10s]  and monks file past into the courtyard.
[7009.10s -> 7010.58s]  The abbot himself emerges from the room
[7011.42s -> 7014.52s]  in quiet discussion with a few senior monks.
[7014.52s -> 7016.36s]  Let's go talk to the abbot.
[7016.36s -> 7018.00s]  You catch the abbot's sleeve.
[7018.00s -> 7019.68s]  Your head is bowed under your cowl,
[7019.68s -> 7022.89s]  but he still stops you.
[7022.89s -> 7024.69s]  And what do you think you're doing?
[7024.69s -> 7027.82s]  He demands.
[7027.82s -> 7029.84s]  Contemplating.
[7029.84s -> 7032.27s]  It's not what you think.
[7032.27s -> 7036.93s]  Father, look over there.
[7036.93s -> 7038.45s]  Contemplating.
[7038.45s -> 7040.72s]  You reply.
[7040.72s -> 7042.73s]  That so?
[7042.73s -> 7047.66s]  Contemplating.
[7047.66s -> 7049.70s]  Sound of my footsteps.
[7049.70s -> 7051.61s]  The rhythm of my breathing.
[7051.61s -> 7054.13s]  The cracks of the stone.
[7054.13s -> 7057.43s]  All right, which one of these is gambling?
[7057.43s -> 7059.27s]  Which one of these has a range?
[7059.27s -> 7063.83s]  Probably cracks, right?
[7063.83s -> 7065.83s]  Like how many cracks will happen in the,
[7065.83s -> 7069.33s]  I feel like it's probably stone.
[7069.33s -> 7073.50s]  The cracks of the stone.
[7073.50s -> 7075.94s]  They are indeed profound.
[7075.94s -> 7077.30s]  But.
[7077.30s -> 7079.27s]  And he wags a finger.
[7079.27s -> 7082.32s]  You cannot fool me so easily.
[7082.32s -> 7083.53s]  Hmm.
[7083.53s -> 7087.07s]  Should you not be polishing the steps, novite?
[7087.07s -> 7089.87s]  He turns you gently about by the shoulders,
[7089.87s -> 7092.07s]  explaining a few points about the laziness
[7092.07s -> 7094.04s]  of the younger orders.
[7094.04s -> 7096.50s]  The abbot deposits you in the courtyard.
[7096.50s -> 7097.94s]  Effie be with you.
[7097.94s -> 7100.21s]  He murmurs before moving away.
[7100.25s -> 7106.15s]  Oh, shoot.
[7106.15s -> 7108.94s]  This place seems rather busy for a monastery.
[7108.94s -> 7111.46s]  Monks and citizens crowd around long tables
[7111.46s -> 7114.53s]  and a commotion is coming from a crowd to one side.
[7114.53s -> 7117.69s]  Wide doors lead deeper into the monastery itself.
[7117.69s -> 7120.73s]  Small iron lined windows dot the walls,
[7120.73s -> 7124.21s]  allowing a little light.
[7124.21s -> 7126.60s]  What else can I do in here?
[7126.60s -> 7127.80s]  I think you can actually,
[7127.80s -> 7131.80s]  I think you can do more gambling.
[7131.80s -> 7135.76s]  Let's do it.
[7137.16s -> 7141.01s]  Resurrect the dead.
[7141.01s -> 7150.01s]  Who's dead in here?
[7150.01s -> 7158.62s]  That's gonna consume the holy water though.
[7158.66s -> 7166.68s]  I can see the future in here.
[7166.68s -> 7169.31s]  There are no animals in here.
[7169.31s -> 7172.35s]  Do it.
[7172.35s -> 7179.17s]  I don't think I wanna do it.
[7179.17s -> 7184.66s]  I think I'm gonna use diplomacy.
[7184.66s -> 7186.86s]  Most of Effie's monks are gambling
[7186.86s -> 7189.25s]  or betting in one way or another.
[7189.25s -> 7192.34s]  One stands on one leg while another count seconds.
[7192.34s -> 7194.62s]  Opposite, two monks stand under a tree,
[7194.62s -> 7197.13s]  guessing when a particular leaf will fall.
[7197.13s -> 7199.73s]  Along a far wall surrounded by many spectators
[7199.73s -> 7204.51s]  is an intricate race course for rats.
[7204.51s -> 7206.23s]  Let's go.
[7206.23s -> 7208.19s]  The rattle of dice and the grumble of betting
[7208.19s -> 7210.62s]  comes from a side chamber.
[7210.62s -> 7217.34s]  The rat run, the dice chamber, or the hall.
[7217.34s -> 7219.76s]  All right, let's go to rat run.
[7219.76s -> 7221.52s]  You walk up to the rat course,
[7221.52s -> 7223.36s]  elbowing your way through the crowd.
[7223.36s -> 7224.72s]  Four rats are hurrying through
[7224.72s -> 7226.56s]  an assortment of turns and obstacles,
[7226.56s -> 7229.08s]  trying to reach a molding morsel of cheese
[7229.08s -> 7231.04s]  fixed to a spike at the far end.
[7231.04s -> 7234.68s]  A monk with scars on his face directs the proceedings.
[7234.68s -> 7237.61s]  The scarred monk looks up at you.
[7237.61s -> 7240.46s]  Here to bet?
[7240.46s -> 7243.06s]  I have questions.
[7243.06s -> 7245.15s]  Ask away?
[7245.15s -> 7247.18s]  Are the rats magical?
[7247.18s -> 7248.62s]  Why do you gamble so much?
[7248.62s -> 7250.98s]  Do the rats enjoy racing?
[7250.98s -> 7253.38s]  What can I win?
[7253.38s -> 7255.60s]  Are the rats magical?
[7255.60s -> 7257.12s]  What, no.
[7257.12s -> 7259.28s]  Why would we use magic rats?
[7259.28s -> 7261.44s]  They just run, after all.
[7261.44s -> 7264.32s]  What a horrible idea, anyway, a magical rat.
[7269.44s -> 7274.42s]  Why do you gamble so much?
[7274.42s -> 7277.42s]  If you're really interested, ask one of the others.
[7277.42s -> 7280.64s]  I'm busy.
[7280.64s -> 7283.48s]  Do the rats enjoy racing?
[7283.48s -> 7284.95s]  I don't know.
[7284.95s -> 7286.11s]  They run without prodding.
[7286.11s -> 7288.39s]  Could be they like the cheese.
[7288.39s -> 7290.07s]  The monk is called away by another
[7290.07s -> 7291.51s]  to supervise another race.
[7294.85s -> 7297.43s]  Should I bet?
[7297.43s -> 7299.49s]  I wish to bet, you declare.
[7299.49s -> 7302.13s]  This should be an interesting race.
[7302.13s -> 7305.04s]  The monk handling the wagers assures you.
[7305.04s -> 7308.00s]  The stake will be 30 gold pieces.
[7308.00s -> 7310.08s]  What do you say?
[7310.08s -> 7312.78s]  Oh my God.
[7312.78s -> 7315.42s]  That is too much, you admit.
[7315.42s -> 7317.26s]  The scarred monk shrugs and the race begins.
[7317.26s -> 7318.90s]  You leave the rat course behind.
[7318.90s -> 7328.10s]  I don't have any money.
[7328.10s -> 7331.80s]  Okay.
[7331.80s -> 7343.82s]  Should I just fuck the whole thing up?
[7343.82s -> 7347.04s]  Doc is heal disease.
[7347.04s -> 7351.36s]  What about seeing the future?
[7351.36s -> 7352.84s]  Oh, if I win the bets or not?
[7352.84s -> 7356.80s]  Okay, fine.
[7356.80s -> 7358.04s]  You sit cross-legged on the ground
[7358.04s -> 7359.60s]  and put your palms on the orb.
[7359.60s -> 7360.64s]  You craft the enchantment
[7360.64s -> 7363.48s]  and everything I imagined using this.
[7363.48s -> 7365.92s]  You see yourself laying down bet after bet
[7365.92s -> 7369.12s]  against a table full of scurrying creatures,
[7369.12s -> 7370.98s]  but without rhyme or reason.
[7370.98s -> 7375.21s]  Days seem to pass and you grow thin and haggard.
[7375.21s -> 7381.13s]  The crown forgotten in an ecstasy of gambling.
[7381.13s -> 7388.31s]  The vision of rather puritanical one at that fades.
[7388.31s -> 7389.71s]  So wait, if I gamble,
[7389.71s -> 7393.73s]  am I gonna just get stuck here or something?
[7394.57s -> 7403.71s]  Okay, what else can I do?
[7403.71s -> 7405.67s]  You need to talk to the rats.
[7405.67s -> 7407.86s]  Maybe I could.
[7407.86s -> 7414.96s]  Am I within a certain distance?
[7414.96s -> 7416.08s]  Taking the wig from your pack,
[7416.08s -> 7418.04s]  you wear it and form your spell.
[7418.04s -> 7420.28s]  There are no animals around to talk to,
[7420.28s -> 7421.48s]  but from the rat race course,
[7421.48s -> 7424.09s]  you can hear a tiny voice.
[7424.09s -> 7425.25s]  I win again.
[7425.25s -> 7428.33s]  The cheese is mine, you bumpkins.
[7428.33s -> 7430.69s]  It seems the gambling at the monastery goes on
[7430.69s -> 7434.20s]  even in the middle of the day.
[7434.20s -> 7435.04s]  I win again.
[7435.04s -> 7443.58s]  The cheese is mine.
[7443.58s -> 7446.38s]  Even the rats are gambling.
[7446.82s -> 7447.90s]  I don't know if I can do very much
[7447.90s -> 7449.42s]  besides throw a fireball,
[7449.42s -> 7450.90s]  so I don't think I'm gonna do it.
[7456.23s -> 7462.50s]  What about how?
[7462.50s -> 7463.66s]  Reaching up to the constellations,
[7463.66s -> 7464.66s]  you create the spell.
[7464.66s -> 7467.73s]  A quiet voice begins to speak to you.
[7467.73s -> 7471.20s]  Effie may take you into her grace,
[7471.20s -> 7474.82s]  but she is a fickle patron.
[7474.82s -> 7476.90s]  The rats continue to bicker and argue
[7476.90s -> 7481.47s]  from the race course.
[7484.14s -> 7485.26s]  I didn't go in the dice chamber,
[7485.26s -> 7490.96s]  so let's go in there and win in swindle stones.
[7490.96s -> 7492.32s]  You walk over into a long room
[7492.32s -> 7493.20s]  set with a wooden table
[7493.20s -> 7495.12s]  on which several games of swindle stones
[7495.12s -> 7496.32s]  are being played.
[7496.32s -> 7498.98s]  You find a monk who grins at you.
[7498.98s -> 7501.14s]  Fancy a game, brother?
[7501.14s -> 7506.48s]  We stake 10 gold pieces in Effie's honor.
[7506.48s -> 7507.64s]  The stake is too much.
[7507.64s -> 7508.48s]  I have.
[7508.48s -> 7512.14s]  Oh, I don't have it.
[7512.14s -> 7514.66s]  That is too much, you tell the monk.
[7514.66s -> 7515.83s]  Here then.
[7515.83s -> 7518.90s]  He hands you 10 gold pieces from his pocket.
[7518.90s -> 7520.58s]  In Effie's honor.
[7520.58s -> 7522.71s]  Now a game.
[7522.71s -> 7526.65s]  Oh, okay, let's go.
[7526.65s -> 7527.49s]  Three dice.
[7527.49s -> 7528.83s]  All right, let's go.
[7528.83s -> 7530.86s]  No cheating.
[7530.86s -> 7531.70s]  Good hand.
[7532.95s -> 7534.19s]  Unbeatable hand.
[7534.19s -> 7536.06s]  Actually, it's an unbeatable hand.
[7536.90s -> 7548.53s]  All right, you think there are one of those.
[7548.53s -> 7552.71s]  All right, do I say there are four?
[7552.71s -> 7555.05s]  I think I get him off guard here.
[7555.05s -> 7557.97s]  There are four of those.
[7557.97s -> 7560.97s]  Four threes.
[7560.97s -> 7565.46s]  Call it, that's fine.
[7565.46s -> 7567.18s]  Got it.
[7567.18s -> 7576.78s]  Yeah, there's no way you bluffed that early.
[7576.78s -> 7577.86s]  I'm gonna get, let's get weird.
[7577.86s -> 7578.98s]  One, two ones.
[7592.22s -> 7596.08s]  Uh-oh, okay.
[7596.08s -> 7597.32s]  I have one of them.
[7597.32s -> 7607.86s]  He only has two dice.
[7607.86s -> 7610.63s]  Three twos.
[7610.63s -> 7612.31s]  I could call three,
[7612.31s -> 7616.66s]  but I think he knows that he,
[7616.66s -> 7622.01s]  that's kind of hard.
[7622.01s -> 7622.85s]  I'll do it.
[7622.85s -> 7625.02s]  I'll do it.
[7625.02s -> 7626.74s]  Three fours.
[7626.74s -> 7639.14s]  Okay, now you're in trouble.
[7639.14s -> 7640.60s]  What do you got?
[7640.60s -> 7643.90s]  One one.
[7643.90s -> 7649.59s]  Two ones.
[7649.59s -> 7651.51s]  Three ones.
[7651.51s -> 7652.87s]  Aw.
[7652.87s -> 7654.11s]  Thanks for playing.
[7654.11s -> 7657.26s]  Hey, thanks for the free money.
[7657.26s -> 7660.07s]  That was fun.
[7660.07s -> 7661.59s]  This guy gave me 10 bucks
[7661.59s -> 7665.44s]  to make sure he could play dice against somebody
[7665.44s -> 7666.44s]  and then he lost it.
[7666.44s -> 7668.16s]  So I got 20 bucks.
[7668.16s -> 7672.97s]  This guy gave me $20 to play a game with him.
[7672.97s -> 7675.24s]  I win, don't I?
[7675.24s -> 7677.08s]  The monk nods with great pleasure
[7677.08s -> 7678.76s]  and hands over 10 gold pieces
[7678.76s -> 7681.02s]  as you take back your stake.
[7681.02s -> 7683.14s]  A fine match.
[7683.14s -> 7686.08s]  Another?
[7686.08s -> 7691.18s]  Let's increase the stakes a little.
[7691.78s -> 7692.86s]  This is how he wants to get you.
[7692.86s -> 7694.12s]  This is what he, okay.
[7694.12s -> 7697.71s]  So he wants, we won.
[7697.71s -> 7702.31s]  I'm done.
[7702.31s -> 7703.58s]  The monk nods.
[7703.58s -> 7706.18s]  True luck does not always favor play.
[7706.18s -> 7707.26s]  He agrees.
[7707.26s -> 7708.50s]  You get up from the long table,
[7708.50s -> 7710.51s]  the monk bidding you goodbye.
[7710.51s -> 7715.24s]  I just left with 20 extra gold
[7715.24s -> 7718.57s]  and we're taking it right to the rats.
[7718.57s -> 7719.69s]  Oh, I need 30.
[7719.69s -> 7721.02s]  Nevermind.
[7721.02s -> 7724.41s]  Shit.
[7724.41s -> 7725.37s]  Yeah, guys, I'm gonna win.
[7725.37s -> 7727.85s]  I'm gonna walk away from that table.
[7727.85s -> 7730.95s]  I made 20 bucks
[7730.95s -> 7733.35s]  and I'm gonna go sit at a different table.
[7733.35s -> 7735.19s]  I walked away from that.
[7735.23s -> 7738.87s]  Come on.
[7738.87s -> 7747.38s]  I'm gonna, I wanna play the rat race.
[7747.38s -> 7748.22s]  You have to play one more time
[7748.22s -> 7751.50s]  to get enough for rats.
[7751.50s -> 7753.02s]  Oh, hey, a win is a win.
[7753.02s -> 7754.94s]  I'm taking my 20 bucks out of here.
[7754.94s -> 7755.78s]  Rat, it's too much.
[7755.78s -> 7762.43s]  Rat is 30.
[7762.43s -> 7763.27s]  I wonder, hold on.
[7763.27s -> 7765.91s]  Let me go back in the hall.
[7765.91s -> 7768.35s]  The monastery is busy and peaceful yet enough.
[7768.35s -> 7770.75s]  Okay.
[7770.75s -> 7771.75s]  Can I run into that?
[7771.75s -> 7773.11s]  I'm, I'm.
[7773.11s -> 7773.95s]  Shit.
[7773.95s -> 7779.81s]  I think I missed my opportunity.
[7779.81s -> 7782.18s]  I think I missed my opportunity.
[7782.18s -> 7783.62s]  I could probably go back to sleep,
[7783.62s -> 7788.80s]  which might not be a bad idea.
[7788.80s -> 7789.64s]  No, dammit.
[7789.64s -> 7806.93s]  All right, I think, I think I gotta go.
[7806.93s -> 7811.98s]  All right, 10 gold, let's go.
[7811.98s -> 7815.17s]  Two ones.
[7815.93s -> 7816.77s]  All right, check this out.
[7816.77s -> 7817.61s]  I'm gonna say there are,
[7817.61s -> 7822.16s]  I'm gonna say there are two ones.
[7822.16s -> 7823.84s]  There are two of those.
[7823.84s -> 7826.54s]  There are two of those.
[7826.54s -> 7828.84s]  Two threes.
[7828.84s -> 7830.32s]  Two fours.
[7830.32s -> 7832.16s]  You need to have them.
[7832.16s -> 7833.60s]  I, I don't think you have them,
[7833.60s -> 7836.39s]  but you need to have those.
[7836.39s -> 7840.95s]  I could say three fours
[7840.95s -> 7843.97s]  or go with three twos or three ones.
[7850.23s -> 7853.31s]  I'm gonna call it.
[7853.31s -> 7856.06s]  Yep.
[7856.06s -> 7856.90s]  Okay.
[7856.90s -> 7864.50s]  It was a risky play, but I got it.
[7864.50s -> 7868.18s]  How about one one?
[7868.18s -> 7869.77s]  Two ones.
[7869.77s -> 7871.46s]  Say you have both of them.
[7871.46s -> 7873.12s]  Let's see it.
[7873.12s -> 7877.85s]  Ooh.
[7877.85s -> 7878.93s]  Okay.
[7878.93s -> 7887.56s]  Shit.
[7887.60s -> 7890.92s]  I mean, I have one of those.
[7890.92s -> 7891.76s]  Call it.
[7891.76s -> 7895.47s]  Oh, there's no way you've got a double twice in a row.
[7895.47s -> 7898.05s]  No way, right?
[7898.05s -> 7898.89s]  Yeah.
[7898.89s -> 7910.85s]  We're good.
[7910.85s -> 7912.70s]  I can ruin this whole thing for him.
[7912.70s -> 7914.48s]  Watch this.
[7914.48s -> 7915.32s]  Let's go all the way up here.
[7915.32s -> 7920.81s]  Two of these.
[7920.81s -> 7921.65s]  You're full of shit.
[7921.65s -> 7937.70s]  You don't have one of those.
[7937.70s -> 7941.16s]  Oh, no.
[7941.16s -> 7945.10s]  I have one too.
[7945.10s -> 7948.06s]  I fucked it up so bad, I think.
[7948.06s -> 7949.94s]  That was not a bad play though.
[7949.94s -> 7953.49s]  You can't tell me that was a bad play.
[7953.49s -> 7954.81s]  I could call them right here.
[7954.81s -> 7961.14s]  No, I have to say there's one three.
[7961.14s -> 7964.10s]  Yes.
[7964.10s -> 7965.82s]  Why would you do that?
[7965.82s -> 7967.38s]  He just threw it away so bad.
[7967.38s -> 7969.68s]  What?
[7969.68s -> 7972.18s]  I had 37 gold.
[7972.18s -> 7973.30s]  All right, now I'm up.
[7973.30s -> 7982.42s]  So now I can do one more.
[7982.42s -> 7989.50s]  Okay, one two.
[7989.50s -> 7991.46s]  Yeah, there are two twos.
[7991.46s -> 7993.17s]  I've got one.
[7993.17s -> 7994.01s]  Three twos.
[7994.01s -> 7994.85s]  Yes.
[7994.85s -> 7996.17s]  I mean, there's no way you have it.
[7996.17s -> 8007.87s]  Goodbye.
[8007.87s -> 8009.95s]  A random farmer is better at this
[8009.95s -> 8013.62s]  than the literal acolyte of the gambling god.
[8013.62s -> 8016.22s]  But the farmer was cheating.
[8016.22s -> 8017.58s]  Okay, one one.
[8017.58s -> 8018.92s]  Let's go.
[8018.92s -> 8020.76s]  Let's really fuck him up big time.
[8020.76s -> 8023.06s]  Watch this.
[8023.06s -> 8025.18s]  Two threes.
[8025.18s -> 8034.86s]  Let's go right off the bat.
[8034.86s -> 8043.42s]  I know that was funny.
[8043.42s -> 8048.94s]  One three.
[8048.94s -> 8052.66s]  Oh, I dare say there are two threes.
[8052.66s -> 8055.73s]  You think there are three?
[8055.73s -> 8063.20s]  Dare say there's a third one.
[8063.20s -> 8065.90s]  Hey, I'm of the philosophy now.
[8065.90s -> 8067.63s]  Now you just bet till you lose.
[8067.63s -> 8071.13s]  And when you lose once, you're done.
[8071.13s -> 8072.17s]  I'm up.
[8072.17s -> 8074.21s]  I'm up like more than 100%.
[8074.21s -> 8075.05s]  You know what I mean?
[8075.05s -> 8077.33s]  At this point, like you play till you lose one fucking hand
[8077.33s -> 8086.54s]  and then you leave.
[8086.54s -> 8091.31s]  Okay, one three.
[8091.31s -> 8093.52s]  This might, I'm gonna go all the way.
[8093.52s -> 8105.11s]  Let's make him have to commit to saying that there are four,
[8105.11s -> 8108.30s]  which I doubt is true.
[8108.34s -> 8112.88s]  Wait a minute.
[8112.88s -> 8118.09s]  There are two twos.
[8118.09s -> 8118.93s]  Okay.
[8118.93s -> 8120.34s]  Okay.
[8120.34s -> 8121.18s]  Guess what?
[8121.18s -> 8124.95s]  I think there are three of those.
[8124.95s -> 8140.06s]  No, make him have to say five.
[8140.06s -> 8140.90s]  What?
[8140.90s -> 8141.74s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8141.74s -> 8154.67s]  He only had three?
[8154.67s -> 8155.91s]  Don't call it, please.
[8155.91s -> 8157.15s]  Okay, two.
[8157.15s -> 8165.40s]  Uh, hmm.
[8165.40s -> 8171.49s]  He might have two of them.
[8171.49s -> 8175.59s]  Oh shit.
[8175.59s -> 8179.36s]  Of course he does.
[8179.36s -> 8180.20s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8180.20s -> 8181.04s]  What just happened?
[8181.04s -> 8181.88s]  What did I just do?
[8181.88s -> 8182.72s]  What did I just do?
[8182.72s -> 8183.56s]  Did I do something wrong?
[8183.56s -> 8184.90s]  What happened?
[8184.90s -> 8190.72s]  Wasn't I just trying to say that he didn't have those?
[8190.72s -> 8195.06s]  Wait, what?
[8195.06s -> 8201.59s]  Oh, I fucking, I screwed up.
[8201.59s -> 8204.92s]  One two.
[8204.92s -> 8205.80s]  Why can I not say there?
[8205.84s -> 8211.60s]  Oh, he's saying there are two ones.
[8211.60s -> 8212.44s]  There are three ones.
[8212.44s -> 8220.50s]  Uh-oh.
[8220.50s -> 8224.71s]  There are though.
[8224.71s -> 8226.05s]  Yeah.
[8226.05s -> 8234.11s]  Sorry, that's one too many.
[8234.11s -> 8238.78s]  There's one four.
[8238.78s -> 8240.02s]  Ooh, okay.
[8240.02s -> 8242.19s]  This is where we get him right here.
[8242.19s -> 8243.23s]  Cause he has to have a double
[8243.23s -> 8245.55s]  and I'm willing to take that risk.
[8245.55s -> 8246.39s]  Brought it all the way back.
[8246.39s -> 8255.73s]  Let's go.
[8255.73s -> 8257.21s]  Okay, now we got him because we both,
[8257.21s -> 8261.14s]  wait, he might be lying.
[8261.14s -> 8263.18s]  There's one.
[8263.18s -> 8264.97s]  Hold on.
[8264.97s -> 8269.33s]  If he has one of those, there are two in play.
[8269.33s -> 8271.49s]  I feel like I have to just say there's one of these to,
[8271.49s -> 8273.57s]  no, I have to make him say there's three.
[8273.57s -> 8276.70s]  But what if he doesn't have one?
[8276.70s -> 8277.62s]  He might just be,
[8278.30s -> 8279.14s]  usually if you have one,
[8279.14s -> 8282.78s]  you don't say the thing you actually have.
[8282.78s -> 8284.02s]  So if I say there's two of these
[8284.02s -> 8291.62s]  and he has like a two, then I'm, I lose.
[8291.62s -> 8300.74s]  I think I have to just say one.
[8300.74s -> 8309.63s]  One of us had to,
[8309.63s -> 8313.39s]  it's, aren't I always screwed in that case?
[8313.39s -> 8314.23s]  Did I actually throw?
[8314.23s -> 8317.27s]  Because he could be making it up still,
[8317.27s -> 8318.55s]  but now he's not though.
[8318.55s -> 8320.29s]  So he wasn't making it up.
[8320.29s -> 8323.45s]  When you have one die left in liar's dice
[8323.45s -> 8325.94s]  or swindle stones, whatever you want to say.
[8325.94s -> 8329.42s]  I mean, if he says one, two,
[8329.42s -> 8332.18s]  if he says one three,
[8332.22s -> 8336.93s]  he could have like a four under there.
[8336.93s -> 8339.09s]  So he actually did have it.
[8339.09s -> 8341.32s]  He actually did have it.
[8341.32s -> 8343.10s]  He wasn't lying.
[8343.10s -> 8350.83s]  Last one.
[8350.83s -> 8351.91s]  All right.
[8351.91s -> 8354.85s]  One, four.
[8354.85s -> 8358.55s]  There are two twos.
[8358.55s -> 8359.59s]  Three twos.
[8359.59s -> 8365.95s]  What's the chance that you have two of those?
[8365.95s -> 8374.33s]  None.
[8374.33s -> 8376.69s]  This is a good hand for me.
[8376.69s -> 8385.98s]  Let's say there's one, three, one.
[8385.98s -> 8396.47s]  Okay.
[8396.47s -> 8401.84s]  There are two of those.
[8401.84s -> 8402.88s]  There are, okay.
[8402.88s -> 8404.64s]  So you're telling me every single one of yours
[8404.64s -> 8406.82s]  is all three of them.
[8406.82s -> 8414.74s]  You're full of shit.
[8414.74s -> 8434.11s]  Okay. Two and a four.
[8434.11s -> 8436.07s]  There's a couple of ways to do this.
[8436.07s -> 8437.27s]  There's do it for real.
[8437.27s -> 8439.63s]  And we both have one, two.
[8440.03s -> 8447.96s]  You might have two twos.
[8447.96s -> 8450.77s]  Let's go with this.
[8450.77s -> 8452.68s]  Call it.
[8452.68s -> 8472.32s]  All right.
[8472.32s -> 8473.16s]  Come on.
[8473.16s -> 8474.00s]  Do you have two?
[8474.00s -> 8474.84s]  Do you have snake eyes?
[8474.84s -> 8475.68s]  Please, you don't.
[8475.68s -> 8478.41s]  You don't have two.
[8478.41s -> 8488.45s]  Ah, come on.
[8488.45s -> 8489.73s]  I'm winning this one.
[8489.73s -> 8500.60s]  Check this out.
[8500.60s -> 8501.44s]  Okay.
[8501.44s -> 8511.86s]  What was his first one?
[8511.86s -> 8513.20s]  You definitely have two.
[8513.20s -> 8516.97s]  He's got two.
[8516.97s -> 8526.98s]  Yeah, I'm going to get my money back.
[8526.98s -> 8535.19s]  What two ones?
[8535.19s -> 8536.35s]  One, two.
[8536.35s -> 8560.47s]  Okay.
[8560.47s -> 8561.87s]  The probability that this is wrong,
[8561.87s -> 8562.71s]  he's going to call this
[8562.71s -> 8563.55s]  because he's going to be like,
[8563.55s -> 8567.22s]  what the fuck are you talking about?
[8567.22s -> 8569.81s]  Because I don't think he has a two.
[8569.81s -> 8571.52s]  He's just going to call it
[8571.52s -> 8575.35s]  and I'm going to lose.
[8575.35s -> 8576.19s]  I mean, I'll do it.
[8576.19s -> 8577.11s]  It's like the best play,
[8577.11s -> 8580.50s]  but he, yeah, he doesn't have a two.
[8580.50s -> 8582.10s]  If he has a two, that'd be crazy.
[8582.10s -> 8584.37s]  Wow.
[8584.37s -> 8585.69s]  How did he have a two?
[8585.69s -> 8591.50s]  Okay.
[8591.50s -> 8593.04s]  All right, we got the money back.
[8593.04s -> 8595.11s]  One, one.
[8595.11s -> 8596.51s]  Well, I dare say, wait a minute.
[8596.51s -> 8597.35s]  He could be lying,
[8597.35s -> 8598.43s]  but let's just call him out on it.
[8598.43s -> 8599.27s]  There are two ones.
[8599.27s -> 8600.48s]  Call it.
[8600.48s -> 8601.32s]  That's fine.
[8601.32s -> 8602.16s]  There cannot be three ones.
[8602.16s -> 8603.28s]  It's physically not possible.
[8603.28s -> 8608.52s]  I will take my money back, please.
[8608.52s -> 8609.36s]  Okay.
[8609.36s -> 8610.20s]  Hey, look at that.
[8610.20s -> 8612.18s]  We're exactly where we just were.
[8612.18s -> 8617.28s]  Can you lend me more money?
[8617.28s -> 8619.90s]  Can you lend me more money?
[8619.90s -> 8621.37s]  I cannot.
[8621.37s -> 8623.41s]  Effie does not wish us to be generous
[8623.41s -> 8629.58s]  as generosity defies the action of luck.
[8629.58s -> 8633.02s]  Okay, that was fun.
[8633.02s -> 8633.86s]  The monk nods.
[8633.86s -> 8635.64s]  You get up from the long table.
[8635.64s -> 8640.67s]  You bid the monk farewell.
[8640.67s -> 8643.31s]  So I just want to make sure I get this clear
[8643.31s -> 8645.20s]  with everybody here watching.
[8645.20s -> 8646.52s]  The whole idea was everyone was like,
[8646.52s -> 8647.88s]  get up, no, stop gambling.
[8647.88s -> 8648.76s]  Get up from that table.
[8648.76s -> 8649.60s]  Get out of here.
[8649.60s -> 8650.68s]  Get up.
[8650.68s -> 8652.72s]  And now bet even more over there,
[8652.72s -> 8655.20s]  is what you're saying.
[8655.20s -> 8657.84s]  The price for entry is 30 gold over here.
[8657.84s -> 8661.62s]  It's 10 over there.
[8661.62s -> 8666.74s]  Okay.
[8666.74s -> 8667.98s]  You head back to the rat course.
[8667.98s -> 8669.70s]  Spectators stand either side,
[8670.38s -> 8671.46s]  the monk ripping money.
[8671.46s -> 8673.21s]  The scarred monk greets you.
[8673.21s -> 8675.82s]  A bet, I hope.
[8675.82s -> 8678.00s]  I wish to bet.
[8678.00s -> 8680.76s]  This round will be an odd round.
[8680.76s -> 8683.82s]  The monk handling the wagers assures you.
[8683.82s -> 8686.18s]  It's 30 gold pieces.
[8686.18s -> 8689.41s]  What do you say?
[8689.41s -> 8690.81s]  An odd round.
[8690.81s -> 8692.05s]  Should I watch one?
[8692.05s -> 8694.75s]  We're gonna pass.
[8694.75s -> 8697.03s]  You declined to bet and the race goes on.
[8697.03s -> 8701.26s]  The rat you had your eye on loses by inches.
[8701.26s -> 8703.75s]  Next round starting soon.
[8703.75s -> 8705.23s]  You in for this one?
[8705.23s -> 8706.43s]  It's 30 gold pieces.
[8706.43s -> 8714.19s]  What do you say?
[8714.19s -> 8717.15s]  You place your coin on a promising looking rat.
[8717.15s -> 8718.91s]  The four rats shoot off,
[8718.91s -> 8721.39s]  climbing a steep hill made of wood and paper.
[8721.39s -> 8724.33s]  Your pick stumbles near the top.
[8724.33s -> 8726.33s]  The rats then jostle through a narrow tunnel
[8726.33s -> 8729.85s]  and your favorite nearly gains the lead.
[8729.85s -> 8731.29s]  The rats round a sharp corner
[8731.29s -> 8732.81s]  and then rush towards the finish line.
[8732.81s -> 8734.57s]  Yours looks confident as it nears the end
[8734.57s -> 8737.46s]  though it's hard to tell with a rat.
[8737.46s -> 8740.16s]  Your rat comes in.
[8740.16s -> 8742.04s]  It scurries across the finish line with no room to spare.
[8742.04s -> 8743.76s]  The monks grown as the race ends.
[8743.76s -> 8746.40s]  The scarred monk hands you over your...
[8746.44s -> 8747.64s]  I won!
[8747.64s -> 8750.58s]  I got a hundred bucks.
[8750.58s -> 8753.83s]  The scarred monk hands over your money grinning.
[8753.83s -> 8757.34s]  The rats are scooped up and watered
[8757.34s -> 8759.54s]  and then placed back at the start.
[8759.54s -> 8761.68s]  They seem eager to go.
[8761.68s -> 8763.12s]  And he vexed for the next round.
[8763.12s -> 8764.56s]  It's 30 gold pieces.
[8764.56s -> 8765.44s]  Let's go again.
[8765.44s -> 8767.99s]  No.
[8767.99s -> 8769.93s]  You shrug losing interest in the race.
[8769.93s -> 8772.33s]  You leave the rat course behind.
[8772.33s -> 8776.62s]  I got 97 bucks.
[8776.62s -> 8782.90s]  That's good enough for me.
[8782.90s -> 8789.34s]  I just have a question.
[8789.34s -> 8791.26s]  My question is how high are the stakes
[8791.26s -> 8795.85s]  in the Swindlestone's gambling room?
[8796.45s -> 8799.54s]  I just have a question.
[8799.54s -> 8803.26s]  You had seven before betting.
[8803.26s -> 8808.38s]  I did have seven gold before I came in here.
[8808.38s -> 8810.22s]  That is a monstrous increase.
[8811.94s -> 8813.62s]  I'm going to take it and leave.
[8813.62s -> 8818.22s]  I'm going to take it and leave.
[8818.22s -> 8820.92s]  You make your way down the steps and out of the yard.
[8820.92s -> 8824.81s]  It's time to leave.
[8824.81s -> 8828.01s]  Back out to the road.
[8828.01s -> 8828.85s]  All right.
[8828.85s -> 8829.93s]  I'm going to go be right back.
[8829.93s -> 8831.80s]  I'm going to refill my tea
[8831.80s -> 8835.37s]  and I will see you guys in a few minutes.
[8835.37s -> 9545.57s]  Be right back.
[9545.57s -> 9546.93s]  I made a tea.
[9546.93s -> 9554.14s]  Took a little bit.
[9554.14s -> 9557.94s]  I took a little extra minutes.
[9557.94s -> 9558.78s]  Refunded.
[9558.82s -> 9561.81s]  What are you betting on?
[9561.81s -> 9563.41s]  You guys making bets on when I was...
[9563.41s -> 9570.41s]  If I was going to come back?
[9570.41s -> 9575.96s]  I just don't come back.
[9575.96s -> 9578.70s]  Well, that would have been a crazy return.
[9578.70s -> 9582.43s]  I'm imagining nobody was doing that.
[9582.43s -> 9585.93s]  That would have been like a 100 to one return
[9585.93s -> 9590.62s]  on channel points.
[9590.62s -> 9594.00s]  All right, let's go.
[9594.00s -> 9598.23s]  We stepped out of the gambling hall,
[9598.23s -> 9600.31s]  back in a Manpang.
[9600.31s -> 9602.46s]  And this is where we ended up.
[9602.46s -> 9606.11s]  Not very far from where we just were.
[9606.11s -> 9608.95s]  We got attacked by bees over here.
[9608.95s -> 9614.74s]  We kind of died.
[9614.74s -> 9616.62s]  Do we want to go back this way again?
[9616.62s -> 9618.52s]  I was going to go this way.
[9618.52s -> 9621.54s]  That's where I was going to be.
[9621.54s -> 9623.71s]  So let's just continue our journey
[9623.71s -> 9629.58s]  the same way that we were going to go.
[9629.58s -> 9631.82s]  The road curves along the edge of a tall stone wall,
[9631.82s -> 9635.09s]  eventually reaching the door to the wheat fields.
[9635.09s -> 9637.10s]  Not going back in there.
[9637.10s -> 9638.64s]  We're going this way.
[9638.64s -> 9645.22s]  It's where I was going to go before.
[9645.22s -> 9646.98s]  You continue along the road.
[9646.98s -> 9649.46s]  The sun has reached its highest point now.
[9649.46s -> 9650.90s]  You pass a side street,
[9650.90s -> 9656.38s]  leading off into a maze of smaller streets and alleys.
[9656.38s -> 9663.18s]  The maze side streets are over here.
[9663.18s -> 9664.58s]  Eh, side streets are fun.
[9664.58s -> 9668.37s]  Let's go down here.
[9668.37s -> 9671.49s]  You walk down a narrow street lined by low warehouses.
[9671.49s -> 9674.26s]  You catch the scent of grain as you pass one.
[9674.26s -> 9677.14s]  You're into the middle part of the day,
[9677.14s -> 9679.56s]  and yet the citadel is still cold.
[9679.56s -> 9680.56s]  As you turn a slight corner,
[9680.56s -> 9682.28s]  you spy three guards walking towards you.
[9682.28s -> 9685.69s]  One dressed in a finery of a captain.
[9685.69s -> 9693.32s]  Distracted by conversation, they have yet to spot you.
[9693.32s -> 9697.53s]  Um, hide in a warehouse.
[9697.53s -> 9700.13s]  You hurry quickly over to the door of a nearby warehouse
[9700.13s -> 9702.90s]  and slip inside.
[9702.90s -> 9706.58s]  I'm not messing with that right now.
[9706.58s -> 9709.39s]  The large warehouse is filled with stacks of crates,
[9709.39s -> 9712.74s]  but as you enter, you hear a guard speak.
[9714.48s -> 9716.01s]  See what?
[9716.01s -> 9718.88s]  Someone just went in that building.
[9718.88s -> 9722.00s]  Footsteps grow louder as they approach the entrance.
[9722.00s -> 9724.17s]  Hide.
[9724.17s -> 9726.29s]  You duck into the narrow passage between the crates,
[9726.29s -> 9728.19s]  weaving in the gloom.
[9728.19s -> 9729.93s]  The air here is stuffy,
[9729.93s -> 9731.97s]  and you resist the urge to sneeze
[9731.97s -> 9735.45s]  as you disturb layers of dust.
[9735.45s -> 9737.21s]  Oh, thank God.
[9737.21s -> 9740.17s]  Hidden, you watch the three guards stop at the threshold,
[9740.17s -> 9742.22s]  trying to catch sight of you.
[9742.22s -> 9745.74s]  It still must be in here, one says.
[9745.74s -> 9746.70s]  They begin to creep along,
[9746.70s -> 9749.83s]  probing stacks of cloth with drawn blades.
[9749.83s -> 9753.48s]  Their captain stands at the entrance, feet planted wide.
[9753.48s -> 9755.77s]  Her skin shimmers in the dim light.
[9755.77s -> 9759.55s]  There is magic at work.
[9759.55s -> 9764.18s]  All right, um, I don't know.
[9764.18s -> 9768.98s]  I feel like waiting is a bad idea, but so is this one.
[9768.98s -> 9774.62s]  And this is probably the worst idea.
[9774.62s -> 9778.58s]  Maybe slip?
[9778.58s -> 9782.38s]  All right, I'm gonna wait, and then I'm gonna slip.
[9782.38s -> 9785.02s]  You continue hiding, waiting for the moment to strike.
[9785.02s -> 9787.66s]  The guards blunder through the warehouse,
[9787.66s -> 9789.82s]  walking down corridors of crates.
[9789.82s -> 9791.14s]  They penetrate deeper into the warehouse,
[9791.14s -> 9794.96s]  leaving the captain alone at the threshold.
[9794.96s -> 9797.12s]  Hunt down the guards.
[9797.16s -> 9804.48s]  Okay, uh-huh.
[9804.48s -> 9808.97s]  Should I do that?
[9808.97s -> 9810.67s]  That's a blunder move.
[9810.67s -> 9813.18s]  That kind of is a blunder.
[9813.18s -> 9816.48s]  Yeah, I'm leaving.
[9816.48s -> 9817.88s]  With the two guards now far away,
[9817.88s -> 9820.34s]  you're able to sneak towards the exit.
[9820.34s -> 9823.18s]  You creep past crates until you are a short distance away
[9823.18s -> 9824.96s]  from the captain in the doorway.
[9824.96s -> 9827.81s]  Her skin is still shimmering in the light.
[9827.81s -> 9831.23s]  Find anything, she shouts.
[9831.23s -> 9834.83s]  Not yet, comes a voice from the back of the warehouse.
[9834.83s -> 9842.20s]  Just charge her.
[9842.20s -> 9844.26s]  Turn this down a little.
[9844.26s -> 9847.86s]  All right, uh, law, they're intelligent.
[9847.86s -> 9851.65s]  They're not non-intelligent.
[9851.65s -> 9855.94s]  Her, I can't cast it because I don't know it.
[9855.94s -> 9858.19s]  Jig is easy here.
[9858.19s -> 9861.96s]  It's always funny.
[9861.96s -> 9868.50s]  Zap is always here.
[9868.50s -> 9870.92s]  Uh, I could fart.
[9870.92s -> 9873.18s]  I could make the whole room smell.
[9873.18s -> 9876.72s]  That's comedy right there too.
[9876.72s -> 9882.39s]  Do we want to do the comedy spells or the damage spells?
[9885.46s -> 9887.14s]  I feel like I never have a playthrough with this,
[9887.14s -> 9892.30s]  so I'm gonna do it.
[9892.30s -> 9894.66s]  You grab your nose plugs and stick them into your nostrils
[9894.66s -> 9896.22s]  before casting the spell.
[9896.22s -> 9898.78s]  A terrible odor begins to blossom from your sleeves
[9898.78s -> 9900.72s]  in a choking cloud.
[9900.72s -> 9902.28s]  The smell tickles your nostrils,
[9902.28s -> 9904.87s]  but does nothing to the captain.
[9904.87s -> 9906.95s]  She's not wearing nose plugs that you can see,
[9906.95s -> 9909.78s]  so how can this be?
[9909.78s -> 9911.22s]  The captain peers into the gloom
[9911.22s -> 9915.16s]  and then smiles as she spots you.
[9915.16s -> 9917.38s]  There you are.
[9917.38s -> 9920.94s]  Oh, I just made myself really smelly.
[9920.94s -> 9935.30s]  Uh, well, for old time's sake, let's zap.
[9935.30s -> 9937.34s]  You spin the constellations into shape around you,
[9937.34s -> 9940.29s]  winding a powerful electric force in your hand,
[9940.29s -> 9943.83s]  but the bolt simply vanishes upon touching the captain.
[9943.83s -> 9947.51s]  She laughs at your attempts, hefting her blade.
[9947.51s -> 9951.34s]  It seems she is protected from magic somehow.
[9951.34s -> 9954.63s]  The captain laughs at your spell casting.
[9954.63s -> 9956.73s]  You think I am not prepared?
[9956.73s -> 9960.16s]  I'm a much stronger sorcerer than you.
[9960.16s -> 9963.76s]  The shimmer around her is an effect you have seen before.
[9963.76s -> 9966.54s]  Not a force field though, not that.
[9966.54s -> 9970.65s]  The captain watches you with something close to amusement.
[9970.65s -> 9977.80s]  Um, so what's going on with her?
[9977.80s -> 9980.68s]  So I have to counter it.
[9980.68s -> 9981.76s]  Shield?
[9981.76s -> 9989.16s]  It's not a shield though.
[9989.16s -> 10018.82s]  Um, I'm not sure I can do anything here.
[10018.82s -> 10020.79s]  I don't think there's a mini-mite here.
[10020.79s -> 10030.45s]  Um, is it walk?
[10030.45s -> 10034.79s]  Check the spell book.
[10034.79s -> 10036.66s]  Oh, here we go.
[10036.66s -> 10037.58s]  Not zen.
[10039.10s -> 10044.36s]  Not dock.
[10044.36s -> 10049.48s]  Not giant.
[10049.48s -> 10050.56s]  Counter's gack.
[10050.56s -> 10054.05s]  Not blue.
[10054.05s -> 10060.92s]  Wait, no, gack is, yeah, gack is blue.
[10060.92s -> 10062.82s]  Big.
[10062.82s -> 10067.81s]  Not fix.
[10067.81s -> 10078.74s]  No.
[10078.74s -> 10088.20s]  So what spell is she using?
[10088.20s -> 10089.36s]  She's using mag.
[10091.05s -> 10091.89s]  That's what it sounds like,
[10091.93s -> 10094.13s]  didn't she say this wasn't a shield?
[10098.12s -> 10099.96s]  It's not a force field.
[10099.96s -> 10102.60s]  Okay, so, but it's a magic force field.
[10102.60s -> 10107.73s]  Do I, I don't think I can cast anything that counters it.
[10107.73s -> 10113.82s]  I could just attack.
[10113.82s -> 10116.03s]  Is it a projection?
[10116.03s -> 10118.70s]  Mag has a counter.
[10118.70s -> 10123.60s]  I don't think I learned it though.
[10123.60s -> 10127.05s]  And I think you need to have learned it for it to work.
[10127.05s -> 10132.57s]  Someone's gonna play the flute.
[10132.57s -> 10142.47s]  Uh, what else can I do?
[10142.47s -> 10146.32s]  I'm casting this, I don't even know what it is.
[10146.32s -> 10149.84s]  Cast the spell and a bounty of cats appears from somewhere.
[10150.52s -> 10151.40s]  They scramble all over the crates,
[10151.40s -> 10154.50s]  meowing in a rowdy chorus.
[10154.50s -> 10156.54s]  Is that the best you can do?
[10156.54s -> 10158.62s]  The captain finally steps forward, blade in hand.
[10158.62s -> 10160.70s]  Okay, I didn't do anything.
[10160.70s -> 10162.38s]  We're going full blast.
[10162.38s -> 10163.38s]  And it was a great call.
[10163.38s -> 10164.94s]  That's four damage.
[10165.86s -> 10167.06s]  And I'm going forward again.
[10167.06s -> 10168.81s]  I don't even need to look.
[10168.81s -> 10171.69s]  That's what we call horse shit in the industry.
[10171.69s -> 10175.78s]  That's what we call horse shit in this fucking industry.
[10175.78s -> 10176.70s]  Okay.
[10176.70s -> 10179.59s]  The captain gives you two quick jabs.
[10179.59s -> 10181.95s]  Wheedling around your weapon, you stagger backwards,
[10181.99s -> 10187.68s]  clutching at a bleeding wound.
[10187.68s -> 10190.31s]  I made up for it.
[10190.31s -> 10192.82s]  Okay, captain steps back.
[10192.82s -> 10195.56s]  I'm gonna def...
[10195.56s -> 10196.40s]  Mm.
[10196.40s -> 10198.81s]  Okay.
[10198.81s -> 10201.46s]  I feel like I could do that again.
[10201.46s -> 10203.50s]  Oh, fuck you.
[10203.50s -> 10204.34s]  Where'd you get that?
[10204.34s -> 10206.81s]  You've been doing moves the whole, whatever.
[10206.81s -> 10211.53s]  Again.
[10211.53s -> 10214.08s]  I'm being so greedy.
[10214.08s -> 10214.92s]  And look at that.
[10214.92s -> 10215.76s]  Look at that.
[10215.76s -> 10216.60s]  Look at that.
[10216.60s -> 10218.64s]  That's so stupid.
[10218.64s -> 10220.74s]  Actually stupid.
[10220.74s -> 10221.58s]  I lost so much health.
[10221.58s -> 10230.34s]  I wanna do it again.
[10230.34s -> 10231.18s]  Okay.
[10231.18s -> 10232.67s]  It's not again.
[10232.67s -> 10233.51s]  Yep.
[10233.51s -> 10236.60s]  This time you do 3.2 instead of 4.6.
[10237.20s -> 10238.04s]  Okay.
[10238.04s -> 10238.88s]  She steps back.
[10238.88s -> 10243.78s]  I'm gonna full blast it again.
[10243.78s -> 10244.86s]  Struggles to hide the pain.
[10244.86s -> 10246.06s]  She keeps an eye out.
[10249.85s -> 10254.13s]  Yeah.
[10254.13s -> 10258.66s]  I think it's full blast again.
[10258.66s -> 10259.50s]  Shifts away.
[10259.50s -> 10260.34s]  It's okay.
[10261.58s -> 10263.42s]  I'm gonna defend.
[10263.42s -> 10268.50s]  Full blast again and we win the game.
[10268.50s -> 10271.15s]  See you later.
[10271.15s -> 10271.99s]  Okay.
[10271.99s -> 10276.22s]  You thrust your blade through her neck and she falls.
[10276.22s -> 10277.66s]  The captain may be dead,
[10277.66s -> 10281.10s]  but the remaining guards burst out ready to avenge her.
[10281.10s -> 10284.72s]  You only have just enough time to flee the warehouse.
[10284.72s -> 10287.74s]  Get the hell out of here.
[10288.38s -> 10289.82s]  You race out of the warehouse and up the road,
[10289.82s -> 10290.86s]  managing to keep the...
[10290.86s -> 10291.70s]  You're ahead of them.
[10291.70s -> 10297.18s]  You got ahead of the guards.
[10297.18s -> 10301.38s]  Let's go this way.
[10301.38s -> 10302.74s]  You pick your way through broken buildings
[10302.74s -> 10305.02s]  and through the wreckage of fallen homes.
[10305.02s -> 10307.34s]  It seems the city once housed a lot more people
[10307.34s -> 10308.85s]  than it does now.
[10308.85s -> 10311.59s]  Perhaps its life is simply ebbing away.
[10311.59s -> 10312.43s]  Across the ruins,
[10312.43s -> 10315.11s]  you can make out the stalls and tents of the bustling market.
[10315.11s -> 10319.54s]  The sun is beginning to lower and the air begins to cool.
[10319.54s -> 10320.86s]  We already went to the market.
[10320.86s -> 10322.19s]  So we're...
[10322.19s -> 10326.34s]  I'm not gonna run back into them, am I?
[10326.34s -> 10327.55s]  No.
[10327.55s -> 10330.80s]  I can go back in the warehouse.
[10330.80s -> 10336.93s]  It's foolish.
[10336.93s -> 10338.17s]  I do have 90...
[10338.17s -> 10339.57s]  Hold on a second.
[10339.57s -> 10346.74s]  I have 97 gold.
[10346.74s -> 10348.30s]  Wasn't there something I could buy at the market
[10348.30s -> 10351.50s]  that I couldn't afford before?
[10351.50s -> 10356.74s]  I don't think they sell food at the market.
[10356.74s -> 10358.88s]  Oh, I could get the mirror.
[10358.88s -> 10360.36s]  Yeah, we're gonna...
[10360.36s -> 10364.75s]  Let's go back to the market.
[10364.75s -> 10366.35s]  If I can buy that mirror, I want it.
[10366.35s -> 10367.99s]  Because that lets me do what exactly?
[10367.99s -> 10374.64s]  Let's see.
[10374.64s -> 10376.46s]  I can do kin.
[10376.46s -> 10378.66s]  In battle, a gold-backed mirror must be pointed
[10378.66s -> 10380.74s]  at a creature when this spell is cast.
[10380.74s -> 10384.38s]  An exact replica of the enemy will then be created
[10384.38s -> 10386.06s]  under the caster's control.
[10386.06s -> 10390.82s]  However, should either creature die, both will disappear.
[10390.82s -> 10392.64s]  I think that's worth it.
[10392.64s -> 10395.18s]  That's amazing.
[10395.18s -> 10397.02s]  Yeah, it's like 40 gold.
[10397.02s -> 10397.86s]  I can afford it.
[10397.86s -> 10403.68s]  I'm gonna get it.
[10403.68s -> 10405.75s]  Whoa, where did we just go?
[10409.10s -> 10414.81s]  It's up here in the stalls.
[10414.81s -> 10418.00s]  Peddler.
[10418.00s -> 10419.58s]  All right, I'm back.
[10419.58s -> 10421.60s]  I want that mirror.
[10421.60s -> 10423.08s]  48 gold pieces.
[10423.08s -> 10425.04s]  This is so annoying that I have to pay that much,
[10425.04s -> 10427.45s]  but I want this.
[10427.45s -> 10430.86s]  And do I have glue?
[10430.86s -> 10431.70s]  No, no, no, no.
[10431.70s -> 10436.42s]  That's not...
[10436.42s -> 10437.26s]  I'm done.
[10437.26s -> 10441.33s]  And I'll get the cutlass.
[10441.37s -> 10442.25s]  What do you have?
[10447.16s -> 10448.72s]  I will take the broadsword.
[10448.72s -> 10453.20s]  I don't want that.
[10453.20s -> 10459.46s]  You already sold it.
[10459.46s -> 10465.19s]  It doesn't have it anymore.
[10465.19s -> 10470.25s]  Well, that's not good.
[10470.25s -> 10475.38s]  Okay, well, let's go this way.
[10475.38s -> 10479.23s]  Which way now?
[10480.51s -> 10484.46s]  We've been here.
[10484.46s -> 10487.62s]  We've seen most of this part of the city.
[10487.62s -> 10490.40s]  We have the right side here that we haven't done.
[10490.40s -> 10494.78s]  We have in here that we haven't done.
[10494.78s -> 10497.56s]  And this is going through the front door
[10497.56s -> 10499.70s]  where the archmage is.
[10499.70s -> 10500.90s]  Didn't do this over here.
[10500.90s -> 10503.47s]  There's still a lot over here as well.
[10503.47s -> 10520.12s]  I'm going to complete the Western side.
[10520.12s -> 10524.40s]  The monastery is closed.
[10524.40s -> 10525.68s]  Need to get food.
[10525.68s -> 10527.75s]  I don't think anybody sells it.
[10527.75s -> 10531.25s]  At least not right over here.
[10531.25s -> 10536.46s]  I have a blimberry potion though, don't I?
[10536.46s -> 10537.86s]  All right, we're not going to get trapped over there.
[10537.86s -> 10541.41s]  We're going to go this way.
[10541.41s -> 10543.33s]  The road leads away towards a ruined portion
[10543.33s -> 10544.25s]  of the citadel.
[10544.25s -> 10545.93s]  The night air is cold.
[10547.50s -> 10548.70s]  Okay.
[10548.70s -> 10550.02s]  I do remember these.
[10550.02s -> 10552.44s]  These are interesting.
[10552.44s -> 10556.67s]  I'm not going to spoil it, but they're very fun.
[10556.67s -> 10560.11s]  The road ends in a tall wall of obsidian black bricks,
[10560.11s -> 10562.22s]  tall enough to keep out a giant.
[10562.22s -> 10563.58s]  But the wall has crumbled,
[10563.58s -> 10565.66s]  brought down by the piercing gripweed vines
[10565.66s -> 10567.40s]  that cover its length.
[10567.40s -> 10569.28s]  You could scramble over the fallen stones
[10569.28s -> 10572.26s]  and inside easily enough.
[10572.26s -> 10575.98s]  Cold night lingers on.
[10575.98s -> 10578.14s]  You scramble up onto a block and peer over the wall.
[10578.14s -> 10580.82s]  Beyond stretches an empty region of lapping water
[10580.82s -> 10584.06s]  from which tall, isolated, gloomy towers rise.
[10584.06s -> 10589.02s]  Strange noises reach you from across the wall.
[10589.02s -> 10592.79s]  We're going.
[10592.79s -> 10594.39s]  You scramble up and over the broken wall
[10594.39s -> 10598.70s]  into a narrow strand of stone on the edge of a watery pool.
[10598.70s -> 10603.44s]  Towers rise on all sides, connected by spidery paths.
[10603.44s -> 10607.61s]  Sand is scattered over the edge of the pool.
[10607.61s -> 10608.45s]  It's free sand.
[10608.45s -> 10610.55s]  I'll take it.
[10610.55s -> 10613.90s]  Oh God, what'd I do?
[10613.90s -> 10616.14s]  You scoop up a couple of handfuls of usable sand.
[10616.14s -> 10624.46s]  The path between the towers awaits.
[10624.46s -> 10625.62s]  You leave the shade of the wall
[10625.62s -> 10628.26s]  and follow the stepping stones out across the water.
[10628.26s -> 10632.06s]  Everywhere the signs of ruin abound.
[10632.06s -> 10633.50s]  Weeds crack the stones,
[10633.50s -> 10636.84s]  turret roofs and buttresses have collapsed into heaps.
[10636.84s -> 10639.37s]  Why has the Archmage allowed such ruin?
[10639.37s -> 10642.49s]  Surely the rumors of his death cannot be true.
[10642.49s -> 10644.01s]  What is this place?
[10644.01s -> 10646.33s]  It looks like no part of Mampang you've yet encountered.
[10646.33s -> 10653.07s]  The air itself is somehow different.
[10653.07s -> 10655.43s]  There is a tension here.
[10655.43s -> 10657.79s]  The air itself feels tightened,
[10657.79s -> 10660.23s]  as though the world is stretched thin here.
[10660.23s -> 10664.43s]  A taut drum skin pulled over a too wide a frame.
[10664.43s -> 10666.67s]  It feels as though the tiniest step
[10666.67s -> 10670.38s]  might unleash a powerful rupture.
[10670.38s -> 10672.46s]  Look at the stars.
[10672.46s -> 10675.06s]  You look up for the stars, but can't find anything.
[10675.06s -> 10677.38s]  The starlight seems to bend and divert
[10677.38s -> 10679.14s]  before it can reach you,
[10679.14s -> 10680.90s]  as though it's being funneled away.
[10680.90s -> 10683.16s]  What is happening in this place?
[10683.16s -> 10684.84s]  The path splits here,
[10684.84s -> 10686.84s]  with the shortest way leading up to an arch doorway
[10686.84s -> 10690.58s]  in a nearby tower.
[10690.58s -> 10692.61s]  Okay, what's in that tower?
[10692.61s -> 10694.74s]  You look over at the nearby tower.
[10694.74s -> 10697.34s]  It is squat and ugly,
[10697.34s -> 10702.85s]  with a low, slightly squalid archway leading inside.
[10702.85s -> 10705.32s]  I'm gonna sleep here.
[10705.32s -> 10707.72s]  Putting down your pack, you try to rest despite the cold.
[10707.72s -> 10709.48s]  You have eaten nothing today,
[10709.48s -> 10710.68s]  but you have no provisions,
[10710.68s -> 10716.25s]  only two vials of blimberry juice.
[10716.25s -> 10718.01s]  I will take a blimberry potion.
[10719.70s -> 10720.78s]  You gulp down a mouthful.
[10720.78s -> 10722.38s]  You feel somewhat improved,
[10722.38s -> 10724.22s]  and your hunger is abated.
[10724.22s -> 10726.76s]  Then you get comfortable and rest.
[10726.76s -> 10727.92s]  You roll over, trying to sleep,
[10727.92s -> 10729.80s]  but you cannot seem to rest.
[10729.80s -> 10731.40s]  After a while, you get to your feet
[10731.40s -> 10734.01s]  and begin to walk through the darkness.
[10734.01s -> 10735.61s]  Crumbling walls and broken towers
[10735.61s -> 10737.37s]  move past on either side.
[10737.37s -> 10740.05s]  You are walking past an old, crumbling building
[10740.05s -> 10744.22s]  when you hear voices.
[10744.22s -> 10747.47s]  Can you starve to death in this game?
[10747.47s -> 10749.97s]  I believe you can.
[10749.97s -> 10753.29s]  Every time you do not sleep, you,
[10753.29s -> 10754.13s]  if you, no, no, no,
[10754.13s -> 10756.01s]  every time you do not sleep after eating,
[10756.01s -> 10758.24s]  you have to eat.
[10758.24s -> 10759.54s]  Can you?
[10759.54s -> 10762.32s]  I'm really thinking this through here.
[10762.32s -> 10763.32s]  I think you can,
[10763.32s -> 10766.63s]  because you take like three damage if you don't eat,
[10766.63s -> 10769.10s]  even if you sleep.
[10769.10s -> 10769.94s]  You're confusing me?
[10769.94s -> 10772.14s]  I'm confusing myself.
[10772.14s -> 10774.14s]  I'm pretty certain you lose a few health
[10774.14s -> 10777.33s]  if you sleep without eating.
[10777.33s -> 10783.49s]  So eventually, yes, but you could always rewind.
[10783.49s -> 10788.99s]  Okay, let's listen.
[10788.99s -> 10791.27s]  You listen closer, leaning against the wall.
[10791.99s -> 10793.31s]  It sounds like a distant crowd,
[10793.31s -> 10795.99s]  too far even to be on the other side of the wall.
[10795.99s -> 10800.78s]  Where are these voices coming from?
[10800.78s -> 10802.86s]  Let me look over the wall.
[10802.86s -> 10805.90s]  Looking over the wall, you spot a missing brick.
[10805.90s -> 10808.10s]  A green-gray mold has covered the gap,
[10808.10s -> 10810.40s]  coating the interior with fuzz.
[10810.40s -> 10813.62s]  Ooh, I love green mold.
[10813.62s -> 10816.22s]  Wait, this is not the same mold.
[10816.22s -> 10817.58s]  As you lean down to peer at the mold,
[10817.58s -> 10822.52s]  you realize the voices are growing louder.
[10822.52s -> 10824.37s]  Look at it.
[10824.37s -> 10826.41s]  You squint, peering at the mold.
[10826.41s -> 10828.25s]  It is unusually shaped,
[10828.25s -> 10830.25s]  buried in color with peaks and valleys.
[10830.25s -> 10832.65s]  Tiny bumps dot the mold,
[10832.65s -> 10836.14s]  along with taller outcroppings that look like spires.
[10836.14s -> 10837.70s]  But then something else catches your eye.
[10837.70s -> 10838.94s]  Movement.
[10838.94s -> 10841.58s]  Hundreds of tiny specks swarm across the surface
[10841.58s -> 10842.42s]  of the brick,
[10842.42s -> 10846.10s]  making circuits in all directions around the mold.
[10846.10s -> 10852.70s]  What could they be?
[10852.70s -> 10854.75s]  I'm moving away.
[10854.75s -> 10857.83s]  You decide some mysteries are better left unexplored
[10857.83s -> 10858.67s]  and move on.
[10858.67s -> 10861.70s]  The wall is lost somewhere behind you.
[10861.70s -> 10865.95s]  Did I just get health for that?
[10865.95s -> 10866.87s]  Oh, I slept.
[10866.87s -> 10872.39s]  It was a dream.
[10872.39s -> 10876.40s]  I thought I was awake.
[10876.40s -> 10880.12s]  I did, I guess I did fall asleep.
[10880.12s -> 10881.96s]  Okay, you gained a huge amount of gold
[10881.96s -> 10884.94s]  and found no new clues.
[10884.94s -> 10886.34s]  You pick yourself up to your feet,
[10886.34s -> 10890.57s]  try to shake away your more curious dreams.
[10890.57s -> 10892.25s]  The wind picks up a little spray from the water
[10892.25s -> 10893.85s]  and splashes it into your face.
[10893.85s -> 10897.34s]  It stings where it touches you.
[10897.34s -> 10901.01s]  How is the Archmage not aware you attacked his guards?
[10901.01s -> 10909.19s]  He might, pretty soon.
[10909.19s -> 10911.91s]  You'll lean out over the path and look down into the water.
[10911.91s -> 10918.62s]  It is black, reflectionless, as though infinitely deep.
[10918.62s -> 10920.94s]  Let's drop a stone.
[10920.94s -> 10922.62s]  No, no, I don't want to drop one of my pebbles.
[10922.62s -> 10925.54s]  I want to drop pebbles on the ground.
[10925.54s -> 10927.42s]  God damn it.
[10927.42s -> 10930.22s]  You drop one of your pebbles into the water.
[10930.22s -> 10933.02s]  It sinks without a trace and without even a ripple,
[10933.02s -> 10934.06s]  but you must keep moving.
[10934.06s -> 10936.29s]  I just wasted a spell right there.
[10936.29s -> 10940.22s]  That stinks.
[10940.22s -> 10941.14s]  Ah, there's this tower.
[10941.14s -> 10942.26s]  We can go around here,
[10942.26s -> 10945.08s]  which I believe leads to these two.
[10945.08s -> 10945.96s]  This one, I believe,
[10945.96s -> 10949.70s]  let's just go in this one we're in right now.
[10949.70s -> 10950.54s]  We're standing right in front of it.
[10950.54s -> 10953.85s]  Let's go inside.
[10953.85s -> 10955.97s]  The early morning sun makes the air glow.
[10955.97s -> 10957.49s]  You cross the waters and push your way
[10957.49s -> 10959.29s]  inside the crumbling tower
[10959.29s -> 10961.75s]  without knowing what you might find.
[10961.75s -> 10965.30s]  Once inside, you immediately break out into a smile.
[10965.30s -> 10966.38s]  This tower might be gloomy,
[10966.38s -> 10969.91s]  but it's certainly a relief after the ruin outside.
[10969.91s -> 10971.99s]  So nice in here.
[10971.99s -> 10973.37s]  Look around.
[10973.37s -> 10975.75s]  You have a quick peek around the room,
[10975.75s -> 10978.37s]  this way and that, this way, that way.
[10978.37s -> 10980.15s]  It is curiously dark.
[10980.15s -> 10981.71s]  You pay special attention to the corners,
[10981.71s -> 10983.39s]  hoping to find something interesting,
[10983.39s -> 10988.43s]  a colorful spider maybe, or some nice juicy moss.
[10988.43s -> 10989.80s]  You don't see anything.
[10989.80s -> 10993.64s]  And after a while, start to feel a bit let down.
[10993.64s -> 10997.11s]  The atmosphere of this place seems genuinely good for you.
[10997.11s -> 11003.58s]  What a charming place.
[11003.58s -> 11005.77s]  Look at the doors.
[11005.77s -> 11006.97s]  You look over at the doors.
[11006.97s -> 11009.35s]  There's one behind you and one in front of you.
[11009.35s -> 11010.67s]  But when you try to count them,
[11010.67s -> 11014.38s]  you find you can't quite manage it.
[11014.38s -> 11016.42s]  It's probably because turning to look at one
[11016.42s -> 11018.59s]  means the other one is behind,
[11018.59s -> 11020.46s]  so you can't see it anymore.
[11020.46s -> 11022.82s]  And you can hardly count something you can't see,
[11022.82s -> 11024.83s]  after all.
[11024.83s -> 11027.83s]  What?
[11027.83s -> 11030.87s]  Eventually you decide there are most likely two doors here,
[11030.87s -> 11034.42s]  even if you can't really be certain.
[11034.42s -> 11035.74s]  You open your arms to cast a spell
[11035.74s -> 11037.30s]  and end up falling over backwards
[11037.30s -> 11039.67s]  and collapsing into giggles.
[11039.67s -> 11041.19s]  Such a shame there's no one here
[11041.19s -> 11042.31s]  to enjoy this place with you.
[11042.31s -> 11046.46s]  It really is quite delightful.
[11046.46s -> 11051.24s]  Uh-oh, sit down.
[11051.24s -> 11055.46s]  You drop down onto all fours quite merrily.
[11055.46s -> 11057.74s]  This is no kind of place to sleep,
[11057.74s -> 11060.41s]  but it's a great place to cross your legs.
[11060.41s -> 11063.15s]  You try crossing them one way and then the other,
[11063.15s -> 11065.91s]  but neither way is really comfortable.
[11065.91s -> 11068.59s]  You're forced to stand up once more.
[11068.59s -> 11076.56s]  Clearly there's something wrong with the floor.
[11076.56s -> 11078.54s]  You pause where you stand
[11078.54s -> 11082.03s]  to regard the cracks in the flagstones underfoot.
[11082.03s -> 11083.51s]  You trace them this way and that.
[11083.51s -> 11086.58s]  They form loops, branch, and then rejoin.
[11086.58s -> 11088.22s]  It is, you realize after some time,
[11088.22s -> 11092.36s]  almost as though all the stones fit together.
[11092.36s -> 11093.71s]  Wow.
[11093.71s -> 11095.51s]  After tracing a crack for several minutes
[11095.51s -> 11097.67s]  only to have it disappear under your own boot,
[11097.67s -> 11101.67s]  you look up once more.
[11101.67s -> 11103.03s]  You head for the door,
[11103.03s -> 11104.15s]  but get distracted by the way
[11104.15s -> 11108.23s]  the view of the world outside moves left and right a little.
[11108.23s -> 11109.99s]  As you sway from side to side,
[11109.99s -> 11115.27s]  you are soon standing on the spot and just swaying.
[11115.27s -> 11120.88s]  I think I'm fucked up right now.
[11120.88s -> 11124.12s]  I don't have a god to pray to.
[11124.12s -> 11127.49s]  I'm just gonna leave?
[11127.49s -> 11129.26s]  Why would you leave?
[11129.26s -> 11131.98s]  This empty chamber is fascinating.
[11131.98s -> 11133.90s]  You turn around on the spot a few times
[11133.90s -> 11140.64s]  to get a full view and fall over, pray.
[11140.64s -> 11143.12s]  You close your eyes and attempt to offer a prayer,
[11143.12s -> 11147.38s]  but end up singing a song from your childhood instead.
[11147.38s -> 11150.42s]  Five sight masters wearing spiky hats.
[11150.42s -> 11152.58s]  The song brings a smile to your face
[11152.58s -> 11157.12s]  and it must be said, a tear to your eye.
[11157.12s -> 11159.04s]  You have another try for the far door,
[11159.04s -> 11161.72s]  though you are by now turned around enough
[11161.72s -> 11164.45s]  that you can't really be sure which door is which.
[11164.45s -> 11165.45s]  Stepping out into the open,
[11165.45s -> 11167.54s]  you feel a slight headache coming on,
[11167.54s -> 11175.59s]  as though you had drunk too much ale.
[11175.59s -> 11179.86s]  Let's go this way.
[11179.86s -> 11184.97s]  Is this the weed room?
[11184.97s -> 11188.92s]  I don't know what that was.
[11188.92s -> 11190.58s]  Okay, next room.
[11190.58s -> 11193.61s]  You step back out onto the path and follow it a short way.
[11193.61s -> 11195.37s]  Three paths meet at this point
[11195.37s -> 11197.31s]  in the shadow of the eastern rock.
[11197.31s -> 11198.15s]  From the eastern tower,
[11198.15s -> 11200.41s]  you hear the faintest sound of music.
[11200.41s -> 11203.37s]  The air seems to fizz and crackle with secret energy.
[11203.37s -> 11207.54s]  Which way now?
[11207.54s -> 11212.86s]  The eastmost one sounds like music.
[11212.86s -> 11214.66s]  Music in here?
[11214.66s -> 11217.04s]  I don't know what's in here.
[11217.04s -> 11226.93s]  I'm gonna say maybe the one right next to me.
[11226.93s -> 11230.07s]  Oh, that's not good.
[11230.07s -> 11232.89s]  The air moves a little around you, still icy but fresh.
[11232.89s -> 11235.49s]  You enter the next tower nervously.
[11235.49s -> 11238.41s]  This chamber is large, circular,
[11238.41s -> 11241.28s]  and peppered with dark alcoves.
[11241.28s -> 11246.78s]  The floor is pure marble, as are the walls.
[11246.78s -> 11248.62s]  In the center, standing on a pedestal of rough stone,
[11248.62s -> 11251.78s]  is a large stone sculpture of a ram.
[11251.78s -> 11259.30s]  Ooh, study the statue.
[11259.30s -> 11261.54s]  You pause to admire the statue.
[11261.54s -> 11262.90s]  It is about twice your height,
[11262.90s -> 11265.31s]  cut smoothly into the glossy rock.
[11265.31s -> 11266.91s]  The craftsmanship is impressive.
[11266.91s -> 11269.58s]  Sculpted fur that looks soft enough to touch.
[11269.58s -> 11271.42s]  There's only one flaw.
[11271.42s -> 11276.20s]  The eyes lack pupils and are instead solid white orbs.
[11276.20s -> 11277.20s]  You cannot shake the feeling
[11277.20s -> 11283.02s]  that the statue is looking at you.
[11283.02s -> 11285.17s]  Look around the room.
[11285.17s -> 11286.54s]  You scan the room.
[11286.54s -> 11287.50s]  Nothing moves,
[11287.50s -> 11291.08s]  but the darkness in the alcoves might hide something.
[11291.08s -> 11292.96s]  Across the room is a set of double doors,
[11292.96s -> 11295.91s]  large enough that three ogres could walk through.
[11295.91s -> 11297.59s]  Another doorway leads north,
[11297.59s -> 11307.78s]  but the path in that direction has crumbled into ruin.
[11307.78s -> 11312.08s]  I could turn back to.
[11312.08s -> 11314.58s]  I'm gonna look at the walls.
[11314.58s -> 11316.86s]  The marble covering the walls and floors is quite exquisite,
[11316.86s -> 11320.19s]  but peering closer, you notice splintering cracks.
[11320.19s -> 11323.25s]  What would have caused such damage?
[11323.25s -> 11327.48s]  Just then, the statue behind you moves.
[11327.48s -> 11329.56s]  It does?
[11329.56s -> 11333.00s]  Its marble body groans with strain
[11333.00s -> 11335.35s]  as its head lifts to face you.
[11335.35s -> 11337.95s]  It shakes itself, the stone flaking.
[11337.95s -> 11340.41s]  Two blank eyes stare you down.
[11340.41s -> 11343.61s]  It jerks and twitches as it raises a leg.
[11343.61s -> 11347.37s]  It brings a hoof down onto the stone.
[11347.37s -> 11348.64s]  Boom!
[11348.64s -> 11351.72s]  They do exist.
[11351.72s -> 11355.07s]  The air shudders with the force of a single step.
[11355.07s -> 11356.41s]  Boom!
[11356.41s -> 11358.37s]  The ram descends from the pedestal,
[11358.37s -> 11361.04s]  never taking its eyes from you.
[11361.04s -> 11366.04s]  Before you stands one of the archmage's deadliest servants,
[11367.28s -> 11371.96s]  one of us, the sleepless ram.
[11371.96s -> 11373.60s]  You shift your weight, ready to leap out or attack,
[11373.60s -> 11377.42s]  but the ram simply stares, unblinking and unmoving.
[11377.42s -> 11380.44s]  Then it takes one more halting step,
[11380.48s -> 11384.38s]  lowers its head and begins to charge.
[11384.38s -> 11390.50s]  There is no time for any singing.
[11390.50s -> 11394.43s]  Why would I be singing?
[11394.43s -> 11398.82s]  Just in case you know, there's no time for that.
[11398.82s -> 11402.29s]  Wait for it.
[11402.29s -> 11403.82s]  Should I just get hit by it?
[11403.82s -> 11405.47s]  Wait for it.
[11405.47s -> 11409.02s]  You hold your nerve as the creature pounds closer.
[11409.02s -> 11410.34s]  Jump onto its back.
[11410.34s -> 11413.92s]  That's kind of cool.
[11413.92s -> 11415.88s]  You had a clue about this guy.
[11415.88s -> 11418.76s]  Ooh, I think you're right.
[11418.76s -> 11423.24s]  I actually think you're right.
[11423.24s -> 11429.69s]  Oh shit, right here.
[11429.69s -> 11435.17s]  Should have read my notes before going in the room.
[11435.17s -> 11437.50s]  You can sing it to sleep.
[11437.50s -> 11440.97s]  Uh, whoops.
[11440.97s -> 11444.01s]  I'm gonna jump onto its back.
[11444.01s -> 11446.66s]  You grab and leap onto the creature's back,
[11446.66s -> 11450.57s]  hoping to settle into place, but it's a hopeless cause.
[11450.57s -> 11453.43s]  Instead, you vault clean over the ram,
[11453.43s -> 11458.21s]  but it turns on a pinhead, rears and slams you down
[11458.21s -> 11460.35s]  with both hooves.
[11460.35s -> 11463.27s]  Despite its jerky, unnatural movements,
[11463.27s -> 11465.40s]  the ram is incredibly fast.
[11465.40s -> 11467.92s]  You spin in the air before bouncing off the ground.
[11467.92s -> 11469.20s]  Dazed on the ground,
[11469.20s -> 11473.51s]  you hear the thunderous steps as the creature turns.
[11473.51s -> 11475.57s]  Oh God.
[11475.57s -> 11477.70s]  Uh, look around.
[11477.70s -> 11481.06s]  You look around just as the ram barrels into you once more.
[11481.06s -> 11483.02s]  Caught by its horns,
[11483.02s -> 11485.54s]  you are carried bodily across the room
[11485.54s -> 11487.90s]  until the creature slams you into the wall.
[11487.90s -> 11491.46s]  Smash, brush.
[11491.46s -> 11493.18s]  The marble cracks under the blow
[11493.18s -> 11496.50s]  and you slide onto the ground, barely able to breathe.
[11496.50s -> 11500.56s]  The thing backs off a short way, readying another charge.
[11500.56s -> 11502.02s]  Get up.
[11502.02s -> 11503.75s]  You get to your feet, nauseous.
[11505.02s -> 11507.14s]  By simply entering this room, you have sealed your fate.
[11507.14s -> 11511.98s]  This is now a fight for your life.
[11511.98s -> 11515.38s]  Sing to it.
[11515.38s -> 11517.75s]  You know the ram can be sung to sleep,
[11517.75s -> 11518.99s]  but as you ready yourself to try,
[11518.99s -> 11524.23s]  you realize Dintantia never mentioned what song to sing.
[11524.31s -> 11527.72s]  Perhaps it is just music in general.
[11527.72s -> 11528.76s]  Uh,
[11528.76s -> 11531.97s]  Strawberries fields.
[11531.97s -> 11534.68s]  Slang, oh, slang.
[11534.68s -> 11536.95s]  The wizard's three.
[11536.95s -> 11538.23s]  Oh mama.
[11538.23s -> 11542.96s]  Not again-a.
[11542.96s -> 11544.08s]  Karma.
[11544.08s -> 11544.92s]  Oh, oh.
[11544.92s -> 11546.90s]  A-O.
[11546.90s -> 11550.62s]  I don't know.
[11550.62s -> 11551.46s]  Sing nothing?
[11551.46s -> 11557.66s]  No, I gotta sing something.
[11557.66s -> 11559.94s]  It probably doesn't matter.
[11559.94s -> 11560.78s]  Let's do the analy-
[11561.46s -> 11562.30s]  Yeah, I agree.
[11562.30s -> 11564.34s]  Analand lullaby.
[11564.34s -> 11566.14s]  Facing the ram, you sing a soothing lullaby
[11566.14s -> 11569.39s]  from your village, but the creature doesn't care.
[11569.39s -> 11571.83s]  For the tune and charges, it knocks you down
[11571.83s -> 11573.55s]  and narrowly misses crushing your skull
[11573.55s -> 11575.35s]  like a melon as you scramble away.
[11577.88s -> 11587.24s]  Um, I don't know.
[11587.24s -> 11588.38s]  Karima?
[11588.38s -> 11590.87s]  All right, Karima.
[11590.87s -> 11592.79s]  Voice wavering, you try to sing songs
[11592.79s -> 11596.05s]  half remembered from the fire pits of Kariyama.
[11596.05s -> 11597.09s]  The song has no effect.
[11597.09s -> 11600.87s]  You escape being gored by mere seconds.
[11600.87s -> 11603.43s]  You're beginning to feel that Dintantia
[11603.43s -> 11607.32s]  was lying to you.
[11607.32s -> 11609.40s]  The wizard's three.
[11609.40s -> 11610.36s]  Oh me.
[11610.36s -> 11612.64s]  You barely can muster the breath to sing anymore.
[11612.64s -> 11614.32s]  So you whisper the song you sang
[11614.32s -> 11616.88s]  as you climbed the steps into High Zamen.
[11616.88s -> 11618.68s]  But just as before, the cheerful words
[11618.68s -> 11621.59s]  seem foolish and quickly die in your throat.
[11621.59s -> 11624.34s]  The ram charges the song has not worked.
[11624.34s -> 11626.02s]  You are running out of songs,
[11626.02s -> 11631.59s]  not to mention the bravery required to sing them.
[11631.59s -> 11640.72s]  Oh the, oh the wizardry?
[11640.72s -> 11645.81s]  Can I get it wrong this many times in a row?
[11645.81s -> 11648.14s]  Oh mana.
[11648.14s -> 11649.02s]  What was it?
[11649.02s -> 11653.34s]  It doesn't work.
[11653.34s -> 11655.34s]  You sing weakly the strange wordless chant
[11655.34s -> 11659.11s]  you overheard in the monastery of Effe as best you can.
[11659.11s -> 11660.39s]  Song does not put the ram to sleep,
[11660.39s -> 11663.79s]  but rather causes it to charge straight at you and miss.
[11663.79s -> 11666.18s]  Okay, this is, I have,
[11666.18s -> 11669.59s]  you sing weakly the song of slang
[11669.59s -> 11671.23s]  chanted in the temple of Kare.
[11671.23s -> 11674.25s]  The ram charges once more.
[11674.25s -> 11676.11s]  What?
[11676.11s -> 11695.10s]  Why, was it, did she just make it up?
[11695.10s -> 11701.45s]  I'm gonna open the door behind me and run out.
[11701.45s -> 11703.37s]  Okay, look into the stars as you craft the magic.
[11703.37s -> 11706.40s]  The double doors at the end fly open,
[11706.40s -> 11709.08s]  then begin to fall shut once more under their own weight.
[11709.08s -> 11711.95s]  You cannot make it in time before they slam.
[11711.95s -> 11714.28s]  Oh, fuck you.
[11714.28s -> 11717.03s]  You run, why did I not go there first?
[11717.03s -> 11719.15s]  You slip around the ram heading towards the double doors,
[11719.15s -> 11720.91s]  but it is too fast.
[11720.91s -> 11721.75s]  You try to avoid it,
[11721.75s -> 11724.99s]  but it smashes your shoulder as it rockets past.
[11724.99s -> 11730.29s]  This creature will charge as soon as you even blink.
[11730.29s -> 11739.54s]  Um, jig?
[11739.54s -> 11744.13s]  What do I have access to?
[11744.13s -> 11745.21s]  I don't have glue.
[11747.25s -> 11751.02s]  Uh, zap is not gonna work.
[11751.02s -> 11752.50s]  What about wall?
[11752.50s -> 11759.46s]  Oh, can't.
[11759.46s -> 11760.30s]  Oh, slowness?
[11760.30s -> 11762.85s]  I'll try it.
[11764.24s -> 11766.28s]  You move the starlight into order around you,
[11766.28s -> 11769.74s]  and it seems as if the ram is plunged into water.
[11769.74s -> 11772.66s]  It begins to charge and yet is hardly moving.
[11772.66s -> 11774.54s]  You have a few moments in which to act.
[11774.54s -> 11776.53s]  Open the door.
[11776.53s -> 11778.93s]  You tug on the far doors of the chamber,
[11778.93s -> 11781.38s]  but they do not budge.
[11781.38s -> 11783.82s]  Oh my God, I have to open this with dop.
[11783.82s -> 11800.88s]  I need to take a potion.
[11800.88s -> 11803.38s]  I think I'll get out.
[11803.38s -> 11804.66s]  This should fly open now.
[11804.66s -> 11810.52s]  Open locks and doors.
[11810.52s -> 11811.36s]  Yes!
[11811.36s -> 11812.20s]  You leave the enchantment.
[11812.20s -> 11813.92s]  The double doors at the end fly open
[11813.92s -> 11816.48s]  and begin to fall shut once more under their own weight.
[11816.48s -> 11818.96s]  You dive quickly through, gasping for air.
[11818.96s -> 11820.78s]  All right, I made it.
[11820.78s -> 11826.56s]  That was pretty rough.
[11826.56s -> 11829.22s]  Pretty rough.
[11829.22s -> 11833.92s]  So now we're on the walkway.
[11833.92s -> 11834.88s]  I don't know if I'm pressing a button.
[11834.88s -> 11835.72s]  It keeps like jumping over.
[11835.72s -> 11839.70s]  All right, so this is where we are now.
[11839.70s -> 11844.65s]  Here, this leads to these ones.
[11844.65s -> 11847.46s]  We're on the walkway above here.
[11847.46s -> 11850.75s]  You stand atop a short walkway between the two towers.
[11850.75s -> 11853.31s]  A stone archway passage holds a doorway,
[11853.31s -> 11855.07s]  but the door has been bricked over.
[11855.07s -> 11859.86s]  The work looks shoddy and rushed.
[11859.86s -> 11864.22s]  Should I rest?
[11864.22s -> 11866.70s]  You're feeling weak, so you stop to rest and meditate.
[11866.70s -> 11868.82s]  The middle of the day is hot.
[11868.82s -> 11870.26s]  Eventually you get back to your feet once more,
[11870.26s -> 11871.38s]  somewhat refreshed.
[11871.38s -> 11872.91s]  Here we go.
[11872.91s -> 11873.99s]  For just a moment,
[11873.99s -> 11875.35s]  you catch the sound of muttering
[11875.35s -> 11879.03s]  coming from somewhere nearby.
[11879.03s -> 11880.77s]  I'm gonna listen.
[11880.77s -> 11883.82s]  You press your ear to a gap in the mortar.
[11883.82s -> 11887.23s]  You hear grunting, scratching, and the tearing of flesh.
[11887.23s -> 11891.78s]  There is a thump as something is thrown against the wall
[11891.78s -> 11896.67s]  and what might be a bone snapping.
[11896.67s -> 11901.83s]  I don't know if I want to go in here.
[11901.83s -> 11906.46s]  Should I just kick it down?
[11906.46s -> 11911.74s]  Or do we avoid this?
[11911.74s -> 11913.57s]  You kick the wall.
[11914.25s -> 11915.89s]  It bows with the blow, mortar crumbling away.
[11915.89s -> 11919.58s]  It is weakened.
[11919.58s -> 11920.94s]  Kick the wall again.
[11920.94s -> 11921.78s]  You kick again.
[11921.78s -> 11922.90s]  The weakened wall does not crumble,
[11922.90s -> 11925.45s]  but you do hurt your foot.
[11925.45s -> 11927.51s]  Oh, please.
[11931.54s -> 11936.02s]  Why would I want to get in here so bad?
[11936.02s -> 11938.70s]  This is gonna hurt.
[11938.70s -> 11940.66s]  You push against the weakened spot in the wall
[11940.66s -> 11943.26s]  where you kicked and it gives way.
[11943.26s -> 11944.66s]  The bricks crumble inwards,
[11944.66s -> 11946.92s]  leaving a choking cloud of dust.
[11946.92s -> 11947.76s]  A moment later,
[11947.76s -> 11950.12s]  two goblins squeeze through the hole in the wall,
[11950.12s -> 11952.28s]  knocking you to the ground in their haste.
[11952.28s -> 11956.61s]  It seems they were bricked up inside the tower.
[11956.61s -> 11958.33s]  All right.
[11958.33s -> 11959.97s]  They want to...
[11959.97s -> 11962.38s]  No, I'm not going in.
[11962.38s -> 11966.02s]  I'm not going in.
[11966.02s -> 11970.60s]  I'm not going in.
[11970.60s -> 11972.08s]  They are trying to get away.
[11972.08s -> 11973.44s]  Why would I want to go in?
[11984.27s -> 11986.82s]  And he said, oh my God, you're good.
[11986.82s -> 11987.86s]  Fine, I'll listen to that person.
[11987.86s -> 11989.90s]  We'll go in.
[11989.90s -> 11991.86s]  Stealing your courage and with your hand at your sword hilt,
[11991.86s -> 11994.06s]  you step inside the foul-smelling tower.
[11994.06s -> 11994.94s]  What's the worst that could happen?
[11994.94s -> 11996.54s]  Let's go in.
[11996.54s -> 12003.24s]  Go in the goblin room.
[12003.24s -> 12004.28s]  You step into the chamber.
[12004.28s -> 12007.98s]  The smell is worse than you could have ever imagined.
[12007.98s -> 12009.26s]  A few of the goblins look up
[12009.26s -> 12011.42s]  from their rampant cannibalism
[12011.46s -> 12014.63s]  to stare at you with slack-jawed expressions.
[12014.63s -> 12023.10s]  How long have they been stuck here?
[12023.10s -> 12027.03s]  Jesus.
[12027.03s -> 12030.95s]  Well, I don't have very much power.
[12034.18s -> 12041.17s]  I could make a giant.
[12041.17s -> 12046.72s]  I could blow the gale horn.
[12046.72s -> 12053.78s]  I could make a shield.
[12053.78s -> 12060.83s]  I could create the illusion of worship.
[12060.83s -> 12064.37s]  Let's pretend I'm a god.
[12064.37s -> 12069.23s]  That might be kind of fun.
[12069.23s -> 12075.03s]  Should I just pretend to be god?
[12075.03s -> 12075.87s]  That sounds fun.
[12075.87s -> 12079.45s]  Yeah.
[12079.45s -> 12080.73s]  Consulting the constellations overhead,
[12080.73s -> 12082.81s]  you bind the spell and your jewel of gold
[12082.81s -> 12085.32s]  begins to shine in gleam.
[12085.32s -> 12087.52s]  The goblins nearest to you collapse to their knees,
[12087.52s -> 12089.90s]  wailing and supplicating.
[12089.90s -> 12094.03s]  With the crazed mob cowered by your spell casting,
[12094.03s -> 12098.37s]  you have a moment to act.
[12098.37s -> 12099.96s]  I'm going for the fire door.
[12099.96s -> 12102.44s]  You take advantage of the lull to race across the room.
[12102.44s -> 12104.50s]  The door to the east is closed
[12104.50s -> 12108.78s]  and the door in the west wall is open.
[12108.78s -> 12111.97s]  Okay, where are we?
[12111.97s -> 12116.18s]  So this one is closed.
[12116.18s -> 12119.72s]  So this one's open.
[12119.72s -> 12121.24s]  All right, we're going west.
[12121.24s -> 12125.33s]  Wait, what?
[12125.33s -> 12129.54s]  Retreat.
[12129.54s -> 12130.38s]  I don't want to retreat.
[12131.90s -> 12137.54s]  Isn't that the west door?
[12137.54s -> 12138.38s]  You try the door.
[12138.38s -> 12139.52s]  It is locked.
[12139.52s -> 12141.28s]  Your spell will not last much longer.
[12141.28s -> 12142.16s]  If you cannot escape,
[12142.16s -> 12147.31s]  you will be trapped in here with these creatures.
[12147.31s -> 12158.38s]  Um, do I have a key?
[12158.38s -> 12160.70s]  This is the key to the prison cells of Kare.
[12160.70s -> 12171.00s]  I don't, I don't think this is gonna work.
[12171.00s -> 12172.24s]  You have a key.
[12172.24s -> 12175.82s]  You try it in the door, but it doesn't fit the lock.
[12175.82s -> 12176.66s]  Your spell gives out
[12176.66s -> 12179.59s]  and the goblins begin creeping up on you.
[12179.59s -> 12182.54s]  Smash the door down.
[12182.54s -> 12184.58s]  You charge the door with your shoulder and it shudders,
[12184.58s -> 12186.32s]  but it does not break.
[12186.32s -> 12187.16s]  Goblins leap up,
[12187.16s -> 12189.36s]  clutching your arms and chest in a frenzy.
[12189.36s -> 12191.84s]  You are brought down, rolling along the sticky floor
[12191.84s -> 12193.20s]  as more pile on top of you.
[12193.20s -> 12195.04s]  Pain flares up along your body
[12195.04s -> 12198.50s]  as the crazed goblins tear into your flesh.
[12198.50s -> 12200.26s]  You try to open your arms to cast a spell,
[12200.26s -> 12201.78s]  but your limbs are pinned.
[12201.78s -> 12205.11s]  The creature's already flaying strips of skin.
[12205.11s -> 12208.66s]  You convulse as your gut is ripped open.
[12208.66s -> 12211.66s]  Looking down, you see two fighting over your liver,
[12211.66s -> 12215.91s]  shoving each other away as they devour it.
[12215.91s -> 12217.15s]  Curse you!
[12217.15s -> 12220.25s]  Curse you, fucked up goblins!
[12220.25s -> 12221.49s]  You open your mouth to cry out,
[12221.49s -> 12223.97s]  but a beefy goblin kneels on your throat,
[12223.97s -> 12227.67s]  fingers clawing at the sweet taste of your eyes.
[12227.67s -> 12234.15s]  Long nails find their target and everything goes black.
[12234.15s -> 12237.21s]  You have been devoured by goblins.
[12237.21s -> 12238.80s]  You're dead.
[12238.80s -> 12243.53s]  You feel the cold veil of death surrounding you.
[12243.53s -> 12244.61s]  What's going on?
[12244.61s -> 12246.73s]  A moment later, you find yourself moving.
[12246.73s -> 12248.00s]  What's happening?
[12248.00s -> 12258.02s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh!
[12258.02s -> 12258.86s]  What's happening?
[12258.86s -> 12260.77s]  Pee?
[12260.77s -> 12263.30s]  Where are my skin, my eyes, my flesh?
[12263.30s -> 12265.55s]  They were eating me?
[12265.55s -> 12267.72s]  What do I?
[12267.72s -> 12273.62s]  I can't cast anything.
[12273.62s -> 12291.74s]  I can cast zen.
[12291.74s -> 12297.05s]  You do not cast the spell, but rather it casts you,
[12297.05s -> 12308.75s]  pulling you open only to scatter you into the winds.
[12308.75s -> 12310.31s]  You're being wrenched in directions
[12310.31s -> 12312.37s]  you did not know existed.
[12312.37s -> 12313.85s]  The pain is unbearable,
[12313.85s -> 12315.45s]  and just when you think you will go mad from it,
[12315.45s -> 12317.93s]  the forces tear you apart.
[12317.93s -> 12321.81s]  Then you hit the ground in one piece,
[12321.81s -> 12325.10s]  in the thin alleyway leading from the great.
[12325.10s -> 12327.73s]  It is where you met the beggar,
[12327.73s -> 12332.02s]  but he is nowhere to be seen.
[12332.02s -> 12337.16s]  You've lost one point of maximum stamina.
[12337.16s -> 12339.02s]  Check myself over.
[12339.02s -> 12340.06s]  You pat yourself down.
[12340.06s -> 12342.62s]  You're quite alive.
[12342.62s -> 12344.98s]  What is more, you have all of your possessions,
[12344.98s -> 12346.58s]  all your gold, all your knowledge.
[12346.58s -> 12348.42s]  Everything is intact.
[12348.42s -> 12351.60s]  The narrow alley mouth opens into the square.
[12351.60s -> 12355.64s]  You need to rest.
[12355.64s -> 12356.92s]  The alley isn't a bad place to rest.
[12356.92s -> 12360.52s]  It is quiet, secluded, and offers plenty of shadow.
[12360.52s -> 12362.80s]  Removing your pack, you try to settle under your habit,
[12362.80s -> 12366.17s]  despite the strange noises that drift through the air.
[12366.17s -> 12369.54s]  I'm alive.
[12369.54s -> 12373.42s]  You close your eyes and let your tiredness overtake you.
[12373.42s -> 12375.95s]  What is left of the night is restless with visions.
[12375.95s -> 12378.03s]  Through it all, you feel the heat of Anorland
[12378.03s -> 12379.67s]  burning should your quest fail.
[12383.94s -> 12386.14s]  You lost a little maximum stamina,
[12386.14s -> 12389.02s]  died, and found no new clues.
[12389.02s -> 12391.42s]  The Archmage remains completely unaware of you.
[12397.13s -> 12398.25s]  You get quickly to your feet.
[12398.25s -> 12399.25s]  You have not been discovered,
[12399.25s -> 12402.50s]  but you should not wait any longer.
[12402.50s -> 12405.55s]  And now you are understanding
[12405.55s -> 12411.35s]  what the fourth episode is like.
[12411.35s -> 12414.81s]  Welcome to Zed.
[12414.81s -> 12419.60s]  There are no rewinds in the fourth episode.
[12419.60s -> 12424.88s]  If you die, you cast Zed,
[12424.88s -> 12430.33s]  and you have to come back and do it all over again.
[12430.33s -> 12436.67s]  That's where we are now.
[12436.67s -> 12438.47s]  So as you see, I'm back here.
[12438.47s -> 12440.71s]  I'm about to go back into the square.
[12440.71s -> 12443.75s]  And I say that because you're noticing something over here.
[12443.75s -> 12447.14s]  Where are my pins?
[12447.14s -> 12457.01s]  They don't exist.
[12457.01s -> 12461.86s]  All the progress is physically gone,
[12461.86s -> 12465.18s]  but we have the knowledge of going there.
[12465.18s -> 12466.22s]  You keep all your items.
[12466.22s -> 12468.66s]  You keep all your gold, yes.
[12468.66s -> 12473.61s]  But the progress you made is reset.
[12473.61s -> 12475.41s]  So can you buy the sword now?
[12475.41s -> 12476.68s]  Yes.
[12476.68s -> 12480.89s]  That is the first thing we're gonna go do right now.
[12480.89s -> 12485.54s]  So imagine that this just reset to zero,
[12485.54s -> 12489.49s]  but I stayed the same.
[12489.49s -> 12491.05s]  So we don't technically have to do it again.
[12491.05s -> 12492.70s]  No.
[12492.70s -> 12495.40s]  I mean, I think there's a lot of stuff to get.
[12495.40s -> 12500.52s]  So you can be Zedded dozens of times,
[12500.52s -> 12501.84s]  I think, if you really wanted to.
[12501.84s -> 12503.52s]  Although you're gonna lose stamina every time.
[12503.52s -> 12510.66s]  So it's not the greatest thing, not the greatest idea.
[12510.66s -> 12516.66s]  But yeah, let's go get that weapon.
[12516.66s -> 12520.58s]  Would you dupe swords?
[12520.58s -> 12525.30s]  I feel like there's no amount of money that you,
[12525.30s -> 12526.70s]  because it's 600 gold.
[12526.70s -> 12529.82s]  I think that that's why it's 600 gold.
[12529.82s -> 12533.54s]  Because if you played through this game
[12533.54s -> 12536.88s]  and technically saved every single cent,
[12536.88s -> 12543.67s]  you might get close to 500, 600.
[12543.67s -> 12545.35s]  I guess maybe you could get two,
[12545.35s -> 12550.02s]  but why would you ever get two?
[12550.02s -> 12552.28s]  If you gambled enough, yeah.
[12552.28s -> 12554.85s]  Jewels.
[12554.85s -> 12556.41s]  Can you check out that line again?
[12556.41s -> 12557.25s]  Oh, that's right.
[12557.25s -> 12558.84s]  Yes, I can.
[12558.84s -> 12562.43s]  All right, now we're gonna go over there with knowledge.
[12562.99s -> 12563.83s]  We didn't do anything with the statue,
[12563.83s -> 12565.67s]  but I'm not gonna do that right now.
[12565.67s -> 12568.79s]  Let's go clean up this stuff over here,
[12568.79s -> 12575.22s]  because I do want the weapon.
[12575.22s -> 12576.30s]  Everything is exactly the same.
[12576.30s -> 12578.48s]  So if you notice that I'm kind of speed running
[12578.48s -> 12579.32s]  through some of the dialogue,
[12579.32s -> 12582.32s]  it's because it is identical.
[12582.32s -> 12586.37s]  All right, let's do it.
[12586.37s -> 12589.43s]  Uh-huh, there's showing his wares.
[12589.43s -> 12593.06s]  We wanna go to the peddler.
[12593.06s -> 12594.26s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, we don't.
[12594.26s -> 12596.23s]  No, we don't.
[12596.23s -> 12598.37s]  There's nothing else here I wanted, right?
[12598.37s -> 12600.18s]  Hmm.
[12600.18s -> 12605.73s]  I don't think so.
[12605.73s -> 12611.44s]  Although I guess it remembers if you did buy something,
[12611.44s -> 12612.72s]  because I can't buy the mask.
[12612.76s -> 12617.95s]  Not the mask, the mirror.
[12617.95s -> 12619.99s]  How much is it?
[12619.99s -> 12621.75s]  18 gold, no.
[12621.75s -> 12623.11s]  I'd rather, no.
[12623.11s -> 12628.46s]  That's not happening.
[12628.46s -> 12630.58s]  Oh, I think it's because technically we already own it,
[12630.58s -> 12633.06s]  so it wouldn't become an option.
[12633.06s -> 12636.45s]  Yeah, okay.
[12636.45s -> 12640.84s]  I just didn't know if you could buy stuff twice.
[12640.84s -> 12642.12s]  All right, here we go.
[12642.12s -> 12645.17s]  Do you buy gemstones?
[12645.17s -> 12646.53s]  I was told you might.
[12646.53s -> 12648.37s]  I might, may I see?
[12648.37s -> 12649.90s]  Take a look.
[12649.90s -> 12650.74s]  No.
[12650.74s -> 12652.55s]  Gems for a sword?
[12652.55s -> 12654.47s]  How about this?
[12654.47s -> 12657.42s]  My finest blade.
[12657.42s -> 12659.66s]  Okay, I'm making the trade.
[12659.66s -> 12661.14s]  You take the blade and hand over the gems.
[12662.02s -> 12663.86s]  The sword is truly magnificent.
[12663.86s -> 12666.26s]  You have never held anything like this.
[12666.26s -> 12669.55s]  The merchant nods with evident pleasure.
[12669.55s -> 12671.63s]  Cool.
[12671.63s -> 12674.90s]  What else do you have?
[12674.90s -> 12678.46s]  I don't want a broadsword.
[12678.46s -> 12679.42s]  You are not from Manpang?
[12679.42s -> 12683.33s]  Did we already ask this?
[12683.33s -> 12684.17s]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12684.17s -> 12685.01s]  We already saw this.
[12685.01s -> 12685.85s]  Okay, farewell.
[12685.85s -> 12691.44s]  Thank you.
[12691.44s -> 12694.14s]  Wow.
[12694.14s -> 12697.02s]  I think it defaults to the best weapon.
[12697.02s -> 12700.83s]  I think it's a plus six.
[12700.83s -> 12705.23s]  I should not have any trouble fighting anymore.
[12705.23s -> 12707.51s]  All right, what else did I want to do over here
[12707.51s -> 12709.85s]  that I got wrong?
[12709.85s -> 12718.06s]  Maybe the, the captain?
[12718.06s -> 12723.94s]  By the glue?
[12723.94s -> 12724.78s]  Fortune teller.
[12724.78s -> 12729.27s]  Oh yeah, I want to go back to that line.
[12729.27s -> 12730.75s]  Fortune teller, okay.
[12730.75s -> 12737.65s]  So I'm put, what is the play here?
[12737.65s -> 12739.33s]  So you get to the long line.
[12739.33s -> 12742.19s]  Talk to the creature ahead of me.
[12742.19s -> 12743.91s]  Creature ahead of you is a hobgoblin.
[12743.91s -> 12747.33s]  Hey, like what's going on here?
[12747.33s -> 12748.93s]  Oh, you don't know?
[12748.93s -> 12750.41s]  Why are you waiting here if you don't know?
[12750.41s -> 12752.84s]  Oh, so I saw the line.
[12752.84s -> 12753.76s]  So you just joined.
[12753.76s -> 12755.92s]  Well, I suppose when I first joined the line.
[12755.92s -> 12756.76s]  Okay, all right.
[12757.66s -> 12760.06s]  Uh, how long have you been waiting?
[12760.06s -> 12762.26s]  A few hours.
[12762.26s -> 12763.70s]  What do you mean this time?
[12763.70s -> 12764.70s]  This isn't my first visit.
[12764.70s -> 12768.02s]  I always, you can't go here just once.
[12768.02s -> 12768.86s]  Did you say wide?
[12768.86s -> 12769.70s]  Yeah, that's right.
[12769.70s -> 12771.10s]  Fair and wide.
[12771.10s -> 12772.53s]  Okay.
[12772.53s -> 12774.58s]  I would like to get back to waiting.
[12774.58s -> 12777.03s]  Okay, here we go.
[12777.03s -> 12778.95s]  You wait, a thin creature emerges from the building
[12778.95s -> 12781.79s]  with a curious half smile on his face.
[12781.79s -> 12786.64s]  Am I just going in right now?
[12786.64s -> 12792.46s]  I think I just go right in immediately.
[12792.46s -> 12795.34s]  You slip out of the line, which closes up behind you
[12795.34s -> 12797.66s]  and you walk towards the door of the building.
[12797.66s -> 12800.42s]  A wood golem stops you.
[12800.42s -> 12803.71s]  What do you think you're doing?
[12803.71s -> 12807.02s]  Get out of my way.
[12807.02s -> 12809.50s]  The wood golem shakes its head.
[12809.50s -> 12813.02s]  You wait your turn like everyone else.
[12813.02s -> 12818.53s]  Hmm, it's better that way.
[12818.53s -> 12820.01s]  Uh, are you a threat?
[12820.01s -> 12821.17s]  Is that a threat?
[12821.17s -> 12823.82s]  Is that a threat?
[12823.82s -> 12825.26s]  Oh no, not at all.
[12825.26s -> 12827.43s]  Not at all is advised.
[12827.43s -> 12830.51s]  If you visit a fortune teller early,
[12830.51s -> 12833.74s]  fortune they give is less precise.
[12833.78s -> 12836.14s]  That pays to wait as long as you can.
[12840.11s -> 12842.66s]  Push my way into the building.
[12842.66s -> 12843.98s]  You push the creature aside
[12843.98s -> 12846.02s]  and barge your way into the building.
[12846.02s -> 12852.35s]  To your surprise, those waiting in line give no response.
[12852.35s -> 12857.49s]  All right, I'm in.
[12857.49s -> 12858.77s]  You step inside the low building
[12858.77s -> 12861.07s]  just as the black elf leaves.
[12861.07s -> 12863.55s]  Inside the room appears to be empty.
[12863.55s -> 12865.95s]  Then a moment later, you notice a squat,
[12865.95s -> 12873.40s]  ugly figure behind the door clutching a pot.
[12873.40s -> 12875.34s]  Okay.
[12875.34s -> 12878.84s]  The creature meets your eyes and stares with fear.
[12878.84s -> 12885.14s]  It's clear he was about to try to strike you on the head.
[12885.14s -> 12886.82s]  Who are you?
[12886.82s -> 12887.66s]  Give me that thing.
[12887.66s -> 12892.06s]  You grab for the pot and toss it away into a corner.
[12892.06s -> 12894.50s]  Sorry about that.
[12894.50s -> 12896.46s]  I saw you coming, you see.
[12896.46s -> 12901.78s]  I knew you'd be trouble.
[12901.78s -> 12904.96s]  You are Farron Wyde?
[12904.96s -> 12907.84s]  Indeed I am.
[12907.84s -> 12911.44s]  The greatest fortune teller in Lower Mampang.
[12911.44s -> 12913.56s]  The only one, really.
[12913.56s -> 12920.75s]  The others were all, well, unpopular.
[12920.75s -> 12924.64s]  And you are very popular?
[12924.64s -> 12926.32s]  The line outside is long.
[12926.32s -> 12928.84s]  You're very popular.
[12928.84s -> 12932.49s]  Being loyal, I could tell my little ruse
[12932.49s -> 12934.29s]  wouldn't work with you.
[12934.29s -> 12936.33s]  So I didn't bother.
[12936.33s -> 12938.33s]  People who come looking for fortunes
[12938.33s -> 12941.30s]  never really want to hear them, you see.
[12941.30s -> 12945.28s]  They always want to be just about to hear them.
[12945.28s -> 12948.56s]  So that's what I do.
[12948.56s -> 12951.37s]  You are a con artist.
[12951.41s -> 12953.36s]  Oh, no.
[12953.36s -> 12955.88s]  I really can see their futures.
[12955.88s -> 12957.37s]  All of them.
[12957.37s -> 12958.93s]  But why tell them?
[12958.93s -> 12962.13s]  Who wants to know they're gonna die of stomach blight?
[12962.13s -> 12964.85s]  Or that their husband is gonna leave them
[12964.85s -> 12965.97s]  for a rock goblin.
[12965.97s -> 12970.46s]  What good does that do, again?
[12970.46s -> 12974.80s]  You are, you truly are a fortune teller.
[12974.80s -> 12978.66s]  Mm, mm, more is the pity.
[12978.66s -> 12981.15s]  Please leave.
[12981.15s -> 12984.86s]  What is my fortune, you demand?
[12984.86s -> 12986.22s]  Won't say.
[12986.22s -> 12988.74s]  Can't make me say.
[12989.50s -> 12992.19s]  Do it or I'll kill you.
[12992.19s -> 12996.17s]  You ball your fingers into a fist.
[12996.17s -> 12998.73s]  Told you you'd make trouble.
[12998.73s -> 13001.61s]  I'm never wrong, see?
[13001.61s -> 13002.97s]  So tell me my fortune.
[13002.97s -> 13006.99s]  You are an imposter, you tell him.
[13006.99s -> 13009.02s]  Mm, mm, mm, mm.
[13009.02s -> 13011.14s]  Will you answer the question?
[13011.14s -> 13012.78s]  Mm, mm, mm, mm.
[13012.78s -> 13013.62s]  Let me ask you.
[13013.62s -> 13017.22s]  Is it possible to pass the Throvan doors?
[13017.22s -> 13019.90s]  Why throws his hands over his ears?
[13019.90s -> 13021.98s]  Please don't ask me anything.
[13021.98s -> 13027.70s]  Everything you say makes it more and more obvious.
[13027.70s -> 13029.87s]  Makes what obvious?
[13029.87s -> 13032.26s]  Who you are.
[13032.26s -> 13035.35s]  Then shakes his head sharply from side to side.
[13035.35s -> 13037.75s]  Oh, it's no good, it's no good.
[13037.75s -> 13039.31s]  It's too late already.
[13040.43s -> 13041.63s]  Please go, please go.
[13041.63s -> 13042.95s]  I've got people waiting.
[13042.95s -> 13044.95s]  Oh, shoot.
[13044.95s -> 13047.55s]  Oh, butterfingers.
[13047.55s -> 13051.87s]  Oh, you are, oh boy.
[13051.87s -> 13054.59s]  You walk away from the unfortunate fortune teller
[13054.59s -> 13057.18s]  and leave the building once more.
[13057.18s -> 13069.86s]  Outside, the line shuffles forward as you emerge.
[13069.86s -> 13071.38s]  Oh, he's improvising now.
[13071.38s -> 13072.26s]  He's improvising.
[13072.26s -> 13074.66s]  Hey, what the fuck was that, dude?
[13074.66s -> 13078.71s]  What?
[13078.71s -> 13083.14s]  What was wrong with that?
[13083.14s -> 13086.41s]  Looking furious about something.
[13086.41s -> 13089.15s]  Yeah.
[13089.15s -> 13090.39s]  All right, well, that was fun.
[13090.39s -> 13091.27s]  I don't think I did it right,
[13091.27s -> 13100.05s]  but it was still humorous and fun to do.
[13100.05s -> 13102.57s]  I, did I miss something?
[13102.57s -> 13104.41s]  What about the hawker?
[13104.41s -> 13110.37s]  Something else I could do here?
[13110.37s -> 13112.38s]  Oh, this is okay.
[13112.38s -> 13119.60s]  Can I get anything else from the stone?
[13119.60s -> 13129.66s]  Is there another question I could have asked?
[13129.66s -> 13130.78s]  You think you're going to finish this today?
[13130.78s -> 13133.54s]  Oh, no way.
[13133.54s -> 13135.65s]  No way.
[13135.65s -> 13138.94s]  There's probably at least one or two more streams of this
[13138.94s -> 13141.13s]  because I'm probably going to end soon.
[13141.13s -> 13146.38s]  Probably like four hours.
[13146.38s -> 13149.78s]  So if there's another three to five hour sorcery stream,
[13149.78s -> 13151.62s]  we might get there.
[13151.62s -> 13153.22s]  We might need one more to clean it up
[13153.22s -> 13160.07s]  and move on to something else.
[13160.07s -> 13161.47s]  No, not four more hours.
[13161.47s -> 13162.63s]  I mean, at hour number four.
[13162.63s -> 13167.90s]  So in like 20, 30 minutes.
[13167.90s -> 13168.86s]  Four is not soon.
[13168.86s -> 13175.19s]  Well, I mean like four hours streamed.
[13175.19s -> 13176.39s]  There are no takebacks.
[13180.22s -> 13181.74s]  You could beat the game in 10 minutes right now
[13181.74s -> 13183.15s]  if you know.
[13183.15s -> 13186.31s]  Yeah, I, okay.
[13186.31s -> 13190.62s]  I could technically beat the game right now,
[13190.62s -> 13194.55s]  but I want to experience it.
[13194.55s -> 13195.39s]  I want to experience it.
[13195.39s -> 13201.87s]  I don't want to just run to the end.
[13201.87s -> 13203.75s]  There's a lot of fun stuff to still see.
[13203.75s -> 13205.75s]  So I want to see it.
[13205.75s -> 13208.30s]  It's been too long.
[13208.30s -> 13212.98s]  I can't imagine I'm going to play this again anytime soon.
[13212.98s -> 13216.12s]  It's been six or seven years at this point.
[13216.12s -> 13220.52s]  So you have to imagine it'll be at least a few years
[13220.52s -> 13221.56s]  before I would do it again.
[13221.56s -> 13223.16s]  So I'm good.
[13223.16s -> 13227.46s]  I'm good to slowly and surely kind of
[13227.46s -> 13231.46s]  take it little by little.
[13231.46s -> 13233.93s]  All right, so let's keep going.
[13233.93s -> 13239.98s]  I don't think there's anything else I can do here,
[13239.98s -> 13242.46s]  but I'm going to go.
[13242.46s -> 13245.32s]  I want to go into here.
[13245.32s -> 13246.64s]  And I forget what's in here.
[13246.64s -> 13250.26s]  I want to go in there.
[13250.26s -> 13254.34s]  Wait a minute.
[13255.76s -> 13257.12s]  This is bad.
[13257.12s -> 13260.48s]  You head away from the maze of stalls and shops.
[13261.20s -> 13262.76s]  There is a sudden commotion amongst the crowd.
[13262.76s -> 13265.00s]  People are shouting and pointing, looking up.
[13265.00s -> 13268.33s]  The skies have been darkened by widespread wings.
[13268.33s -> 13270.49s]  Birdmen.
[13270.49s -> 13272.56s]  Let's watch.
[13272.56s -> 13274.56s]  You watch motionless.
[13274.56s -> 13277.12s]  Perhaps they have not yet seen you.
[13277.12s -> 13279.00s]  The people of Mampang are terrified
[13279.00s -> 13281.60s]  and scatter in all directions around you.
[13281.60s -> 13283.56s]  The birdmen swoop down onto the ground
[13283.56s -> 13285.93s]  and they'll now empty market.
[13285.93s -> 13289.98s]  They then begin to pound across the flagstones,
[13289.98s -> 13291.72s]  but not towards you.
[13291.72s -> 13294.56s]  Instead, they enter the hut of the fortune teller,
[13294.56s -> 13296.86s]  Farrenwide.
[13296.86s -> 13299.06s]  A moment later, everything is still.
[13299.06s -> 13302.35s]  Oh no, they're going to question him.
[13302.35s -> 13305.23s]  Keep watching?
[13305.23s -> 13306.55s]  What are they doing?
[13306.55s -> 13308.95s]  Are they arresting him for talking to you?
[13308.95s -> 13312.25s]  And will he sell you out?
[13312.25s -> 13315.86s]  He's not going to sell me out.
[13315.86s -> 13318.02s]  You stay low watching.
[13318.02s -> 13319.88s]  Nothing happens.
[13319.88s -> 13322.36s]  And then the thatched roof of the low building
[13322.36s -> 13326.84s]  explodes outwards and the birdmen rise from inside.
[13326.84s -> 13331.06s]  Farrenwide dangles from their talons, limp.
[13331.06s -> 13332.42s]  The birdmen wheel about
[13332.42s -> 13335.30s]  and disappear towards the inner tower.
[13335.30s -> 13339.38s]  Oh shit, I killed that guy.
[13339.38s -> 13345.46s]  Do you think he talked?
[13345.46s -> 13347.80s]  He's not going to talk.
[13347.80s -> 13349.39s]  No.
[13349.39s -> 13350.71s]  I mean, I did threaten him.
[13350.71s -> 13352.95s]  I did say, tell my fortune or I'll kill you.
[13354.23s -> 13355.59s]  He probably doesn't think we're the nicest person,
[13355.59s -> 13359.84s]  but he must know our quest is important.
[13359.84s -> 13360.68s]  Why wouldn't he talk?
[13360.68s -> 13362.70s]  Because I'm the Anor Lander.
[13362.70s -> 13370.70s]  I'm supposed to save every, I'm here to save everybody.
[13370.70s -> 13373.70s]  You are, I'm, he's not going to talk.
[13374.18s -> 13377.28s]  It's fine.
[13377.28s -> 13380.86s]  Rest in peace, goofy voice man.
[13380.86s -> 13382.98s]  I'm not going to be able to hear that character again.
[13382.98s -> 13384.73s]  That's sad, that's right.
[13384.73s -> 13386.70s]  All right, I want to look in here.
[13386.70s -> 13387.62s]  You stroll through the arch
[13387.62s -> 13390.74s]  into a well-appointed empty courtyard.
[13390.74s -> 13392.46s]  From a small booth by the entrance way,
[13392.46s -> 13394.02s]  a guard nods to you.
[13394.02s -> 13396.18s]  Brother?
[13396.18s -> 13404.66s]  Oh, I've been in this, I'm still in this disguise.
[13404.66s -> 13406.14s]  You step out into the central courtyard
[13406.14s -> 13408.24s]  that fills this enclosure.
[13408.24s -> 13411.10s]  This place is blessedly quiet.
[13411.10s -> 13413.19s]  With several routes leading out of it,
[13413.19s -> 13415.42s]  a dome looks up at the sky.
[13415.42s -> 13419.14s]  A fountain plays in the center of the courtyard.
[13419.14s -> 13421.18s]  Search the courtyard.
[13421.18s -> 13422.18s]  You look around the courtyard,
[13422.18s -> 13424.06s]  but there isn't much to see beyond the fountain
[13424.06s -> 13426.02s]  and the benches that surround it.
[13426.02s -> 13429.10s]  The doors are a mixture of shops and storage rooms.
[13429.10s -> 13432.14s]  A few brightly feathered birds flap past overhead.
[13432.14s -> 13437.89s]  This little square is almost comfortable.
[13437.89s -> 13439.67s]  Look at the fountain.
[13439.67s -> 13441.19s]  The water from the fountain plays merrily
[13441.19s -> 13444.75s]  over several stone statues set into the center of the bowl,
[13444.75s -> 13448.18s]  arching satyrs, weeping maidens,
[13448.18s -> 13451.41s]  aged men, head-butting orcs.
[13451.41s -> 13453.02s]  It must tell some legend,
[13453.06s -> 13455.82s]  but what that legend might be has clearly been lost to time
[13455.82s -> 13458.70s]  and the wearing water.
[13458.70s -> 13461.18s]  Let's drink.
[13461.18s -> 13462.82s]  You cup a handful of the sparkling water
[13462.82s -> 13464.28s]  and raise it to your lips.
[13464.28s -> 13465.92s]  A moment later, you spit it out.
[13465.92s -> 13469.34s]  Gasping for breath, the water is quite foul.
[13469.34s -> 13471.42s]  A door leads out to the main square of the inner city,
[13471.42s -> 13472.70s]  but there are several other doors
[13472.70s -> 13474.22s]  leading off from the courtyard.
[13474.22s -> 13478.71s]  One is a signpost, Nighlok.
[13478.71s -> 13487.66s]  Did we hear about Nighlok?
[13487.66s -> 13490.60s]  Uh, I feel like I could die in any one of these.
[13490.60s -> 13498.39s]  So let's just go in here.
[13498.39s -> 13500.27s]  You slip into a small side room.
[13500.27s -> 13501.43s]  Inside are a pile of crates
[13501.43s -> 13505.47s]  and a side room that are marked with the Seal of Kare.
[13505.47s -> 13507.06s]  Let's take a look.
[13507.06s -> 13509.46s]  There are several stacked crates,
[13509.46s -> 13512.53s]  each bearing the official mark of Kare's First Noble.
[13512.53s -> 13514.31s]  What are they doing here?
[13514.31s -> 13516.19s]  A few large empty crates lie undisturbed
[13516.19s -> 13519.67s]  at the back of the room.
[13519.67s -> 13522.88s]  Open an empty crate.
[13522.88s -> 13525.32s]  Isn't that kind of a,
[13525.32s -> 13531.68s]  doesn't that imply there's nothing in there?
[13531.68s -> 13535.01s]  You open one of the large crates, empty and roomy.
[13535.01s -> 13536.69s]  It occurs to you that you could hide
[13536.69s -> 13540.98s]  your monk's concealing habit in one of the boxes for later.
[13540.98s -> 13555.37s]  Oh, stash my disguise?
[13555.37s -> 13558.58s]  Open a sealed crate.
[13558.58s -> 13559.62s]  The crates are nailed shut,
[13559.62s -> 13562.30s]  but you manage to slip your cutlass between two boards.
[13562.30s -> 13564.62s]  You pry off the lid.
[13564.62s -> 13567.26s]  Inside are stacks of magical armor,
[13567.26s -> 13570.80s]  the kind you saw used in Kare by Vik's army of werewolves.
[13570.80s -> 13572.40s]  How could they possibly be here?
[13572.40s -> 13577.85s]  And if it's here, is Vik here too?
[13577.85s -> 13580.65s]  You saw several sets of lupine armor up close
[13580.65s -> 13582.41s]  during your time in Kare.
[13582.41s -> 13590.36s]  This looks similar, though perhaps not as well-made.
[13590.36s -> 13591.20s]  That's it.
[13591.20s -> 13599.44s]  So I can hide my disguise in here, that's fine.
[13599.44s -> 13601.78s]  All right, which way now?
[13601.78s -> 13606.39s]  Uh, let's just check them all, as long as I don't die.
[13606.39s -> 13607.55s]  You approach the guard's room.
[13607.55s -> 13611.90s]  The guard turns to you with narrowed, unfriendly eyes.
[13611.90s -> 13614.83s]  What?
[13614.83s -> 13617.82s]  There's a thief in the courtyard.
[13617.82s -> 13620.83s]  Yeah, there is.
[13620.83s -> 13622.87s]  Her name is Nylock.
[13622.87s -> 13623.95s]  With that, she waves you away.
[13623.95s -> 13634.40s]  You head back to the courtyard.
[13634.40s -> 13640.29s]  Uh, side chambers?
[13640.29s -> 13641.98s]  Interesting.
[13641.98s -> 13643.38s]  You choose a small side door,
[13643.38s -> 13646.14s]  which opens to reveal dirty living quarters.
[13646.14s -> 13649.02s]  A bare rug covers the floor,
[13649.02s -> 13652.01s]  and an unmade bed lists in the corner.
[13652.01s -> 13656.22s]  A wood chest sits at its foot, facing an empty table.
[13656.22s -> 13662.22s]  A chest.
[13662.22s -> 13666.86s]  This is presumably home to some lowly guard or other.
[13666.86s -> 13668.78s]  Pull up the rug.
[13668.78s -> 13671.50s]  You grab the edge of the rug, cutlass at the ready.
[13671.50s -> 13673.66s]  Flip it over.
[13673.66s -> 13675.46s]  You flip it aside to find a small trapdoor
[13675.46s -> 13678.08s]  set into the floor of the room.
[13678.08s -> 13681.46s]  Open it.
[13681.46s -> 13683.78s]  You grasp the handle and pull with all your might,
[13683.78s -> 13685.05s]  but it doesn't budge.
[13685.05s -> 13687.94s]  The door doesn't even rattle.
[13687.94s -> 13690.19s]  Let's look closely.
[13690.19s -> 13693.70s]  You feel along, you feel along the edges,
[13693.70s -> 13696.10s]  discovering that it's a fake.
[13696.10s -> 13697.86s]  The wood has merely been cleverly cut
[13697.86s -> 13699.80s]  to appear like a trapdoor.
[13699.80s -> 13701.40s]  You let the rug fall once more.
[13701.40s -> 13704.14s]  Why?
[13704.14s -> 13707.70s]  Open the chest.
[13707.70s -> 13708.86s]  You squat down in front of the chest.
[13708.86s -> 13711.02s]  There is no lock.
[13711.54s -> 13713.46s]  Open it.
[13713.46s -> 13716.01s]  You flip open the lid.
[13716.01s -> 13718.58s]  Step back.
[13718.58s -> 13721.37s]  Poison gas is coming out.
[13721.37s -> 13724.66s]  You step quickly back, but nothing else happens.
[13724.66s -> 13726.70s]  The box appears quite empty.
[13726.70s -> 13728.40s]  Nothing jumps out of it.
[13728.40s -> 13731.73s]  There isn't even a cobweb or a loose gold coin.
[13731.73s -> 13735.21s]  Maybe this is a simple servant's room.
[13735.21s -> 13736.97s]  Tip the box over.
[13736.97s -> 13740.26s]  You lift the box out from under the table and turn it over.
[13740.26s -> 13746.57s]  Then you hear a click from somewhere behind you.
[13746.57s -> 13749.37s]  You turn and rush towards the exit, but you're too late.
[13749.37s -> 13752.17s]  A heavy portcullis is dropped from the ceiling,
[13752.17s -> 13753.09s]  barring the doorway.
[13753.09s -> 13754.98s]  You are trapped.
[13754.98s -> 13758.35s]  From somewhere nearby, you hear a hissing noise.
[13758.35s -> 13760.28s]  Oh God.
[13760.28s -> 13761.76s]  You hold your breath to listen.
[13761.76s -> 13763.20s]  The hissing is growing louder.
[13763.20s -> 13765.82s]  Look up.
[13765.82s -> 13767.74s]  You look up to see a greenish cloud
[13767.74s -> 13768.98s]  descend from the ceiling.
[13768.98s -> 13771.24s]  Poison gas.
[13771.24s -> 13773.52s]  This is not anyone's living quarters.
[13773.52s -> 13775.56s]  This room is nothing but a trap
[13775.56s -> 13777.28s]  and you have walked straight into it.
[13777.28s -> 13780.09s]  God damn it.
[13780.09s -> 13790.10s]  Can I do anything here?
[13790.10s -> 13791.33s]  I'm throwing a grenade.
[13791.33s -> 13792.17s]  I can't.
[13792.17s -> 13796.68s]  I used it to test the water lake an hour ago.
[13796.68s -> 13798.89s]  What an idiot.
[13798.89s -> 13807.57s]  Strength?
[13807.57s -> 13809.22s]  A huff might work.
[13809.22s -> 13814.78s]  Gale horn?
[13814.78s -> 13816.94s]  You turn into the starlight
[13816.94s -> 13818.22s]  and put the alignment around you,
[13818.22s -> 13820.66s]  lifting the gale horn and blowing a loud note.
[13820.66s -> 13823.06s]  The mighty gale howls about the room,
[13823.06s -> 13825.82s]  blowing the poison gas out through the portcullis.
[13825.82s -> 13828.69s]  The clean air tastes sweet.
[13828.69s -> 13831.75s]  You approach the portcullis.
[13831.75s -> 13832.59s]  Help!
[13832.59s -> 13833.43s]  Help!
[13833.43s -> 13834.27s]  Help!
[13834.27s -> 13835.11s]  Help!
[13835.11s -> 13836.32s]  Help!
[13836.32s -> 13838.68s]  It's not gonna work.
[13838.68s -> 13841.36s]  Let's look it over.
[13841.36s -> 13842.20s]  Looking over the grate,
[13842.20s -> 13845.01s]  you can see it descends from a hidden panel in the ceiling,
[13845.01s -> 13846.81s]  but you can't see any switches or levers
[13846.81s -> 13851.26s]  on the walls either side.
[13854.16s -> 13855.77s]  I'm gonna lift it.
[13855.77s -> 13856.85s]  In your healthy condition,
[13856.85s -> 13858.73s]  you have no trouble lifting the gate.
[13858.73s -> 13863.50s]  It rolls up and you hold it aloft before diving under it.
[13863.50s -> 13868.12s]  Okay, so it was just a trap room.
[13868.12s -> 13870.41s]  All right, now we're gonna go in here.
[13870.41s -> 13877.76s]  Let's wait.
[13877.76s -> 13880.12s]  Wait a minute.
[13880.12s -> 13882.78s]  Can I come out of this?
[13882.78s -> 13886.29s]  Wait.
[13886.29s -> 13887.13s]  No.
[13887.13s -> 13890.11s]  There's a different one.
[13890.11s -> 13894.89s]  All right, let's go to Nylok's shop.
[13894.89s -> 13897.50s]  I did come out from under that.
[13897.50s -> 13899.62s]  You enter a trade post of some kind.
[13899.62s -> 13903.29s]  A bald woman with one eye leans on a counter,
[13903.29s -> 13906.57s]  flanked by shelves stacked with goods and trinkets.
[13906.57s -> 13913.32s]  At this moment, she's talking to a finely dressed traveler.
[13922.90s -> 13925.58s]  The merchant Nylok glances up as you enter,
[13925.58s -> 13928.82s]  then returns to her bargaining.
[13928.82s -> 13932.04s]  Still, I'm, okay, well, I'm gonna take shit.
[13932.04s -> 13939.78s]  You stroll over to the back of the room.
[13939.78s -> 13943.38s]  The man and Nylok are both distracted by their bargaining.
[13943.38s -> 13945.34s]  You pretend to examine a stack of pelts
[13945.34s -> 13947.50s]  while spying some likely trinkets
[13947.50s -> 13949.80s]  in the corner of your eye.
[13949.80s -> 13951.56s]  Grab something and run.
[13951.56s -> 13957.28s]  Quietly pocket something or don't risk it.
[13957.28s -> 13958.32s]  I've never picked it
[13958.32s -> 13963.80s]  because it always feels like the just die option,
[13963.80s -> 13966.68s]  but it's funny that you can actually just grab and run.
[13966.68s -> 13969.53s]  Somebody's just gonna kill you.
[13969.53s -> 13971.49s]  Maybe it works.
[13971.49s -> 13977.96s]  Maybe it works.
[13977.96s -> 13980.48s]  This option is always here.
[13980.48s -> 13982.99s]  I never touch it.
[13982.99s -> 13985.33s]  I feel like, should we just try?
[13985.33s -> 13995.00s]  Like, if I grab and just fucking run, it might just work.
[13995.00s -> 13998.00s]  Moving quickly, you grab a jewel of gold
[13998.00s -> 13999.86s]  off the nearest shelf.
[13999.86s -> 14002.98s]  Clutching your prize, you race for the door.
[14002.98s -> 14005.70s]  Nylok languidly presses a switch as you reach the door
[14005.70s -> 14007.62s]  and a thick rope net drops from the ceiling.
[14007.62s -> 14011.24s]  You are trapped.
[14011.24s -> 14015.25s]  Nice try, but this is Mampang.
[14015.25s -> 14019.52s]  You have to be faster than that to steal from me.
[14019.52s -> 14020.36s]  I'm sorry.
[14020.36s -> 14021.20s]  I said, release me.
[14021.20s -> 14022.04s]  I, release me.
[14022.04s -> 14023.52s]  I, you cannot keep me here.
[14023.52s -> 14025.45s]  I'm so sorry.
[14025.45s -> 14027.44s]  I don't intend to.
[14027.44s -> 14032.24s]  She pulls on a bell rope and a group of guards soon arrive.
[14032.24s -> 14037.92s]  Oh, that didn't work.
[14037.92s -> 14040.68s]  Bound and gagged, you are dragged by your ankles
[14040.68s -> 14044.16s]  by two guards who mutter about the trouble caused.
[14044.16s -> 14047.84s]  They gossip to passing companions about you.
[14047.88s -> 14050.82s]  The tale of your exploits will soon spread through Mampang.
[14050.82s -> 14060.42s]  This will make it more...
[14060.42s -> 14063.02s]  Don't say room temperature IQ.
[14063.02s -> 14065.59s]  I was testing that.
[14065.59s -> 14066.59s]  I don't know.
[14066.59s -> 14068.86s]  Yeah, I'm trying to...
[14068.86s -> 14071.12s]  What's the worst thing you could possibly do
[14071.12s -> 14073.63s]  when you're trying to lay low?
[14073.63s -> 14079.01s]  Is scream while you're stealing from a store.
[14079.01s -> 14081.61s]  Like, I'm gonna just grab this and run out
[14081.61s -> 14083.57s]  and bump into a bunch of shit on the way out.
[14083.57s -> 14085.77s]  That's the worst thing I could have possibly done.
[14085.77s -> 14086.89s]  Somebody said, hey, rewind.
[14086.89s -> 14087.73s]  I can't.
[14087.73s -> 14088.57s]  It's over.
[14088.57s -> 14089.73s]  There's no rewinding now.
[14090.49s -> 14091.73s]  And that's not a rule I put on myself.
[14091.73s -> 14094.08s]  That is baked into the game now.
[14094.08s -> 14096.98s]  It's over.
[14096.98s -> 14099.18s]  The tale of your exploits will soon spread through Mampang.
[14099.18s -> 14101.42s]  This will make it more difficult to blend in from now on
[14101.42s -> 14103.99s]  should you escape.
[14103.99s -> 14106.63s]  Try to bribe them.
[14106.63s -> 14108.27s]  You attempt to bribe them,
[14108.27s -> 14111.04s]  offering rewards and fabulous riches.
[14111.04s -> 14112.04s]  But through the gag,
[14112.04s -> 14115.68s]  it is little more than the mummery of an idiot.
[14115.68s -> 14117.28s]  The guards ignore you.
[14118.20s -> 14119.04s]  I'll give you jewels.
[14119.04s -> 14121.08s]  I'll give you precious stones.
[14122.04s -> 14125.36s]  Mm, mm, mm!
[14125.36s -> 14127.24s]  Hopelessly, you are dragged into the office
[14127.24s -> 14134.45s]  of the commander of the guard.
[14134.45s -> 14135.49s]  The room is windowless,
[14135.49s -> 14142.67s]  but lit by a half dozen lamps scattered about.
[14142.67s -> 14144.94s]  I love this picture.
[14144.94s -> 14145.78s]  Is it a picture?
[14145.78s -> 14147.56s]  Or is that somebody outside looking in?
[14147.56s -> 14148.68s]  Wait, I don't know.
[14148.68s -> 14152.21s]  No, there's no windows.
[14152.21s -> 14154.85s]  Khartoum, commander of the guards of Mampang,
[14154.85s -> 14161.88s]  sits behind a wooden desk covered in scattered parchments.
[14161.88s -> 14162.88s]  Hello?
[14162.88s -> 14166.88s]  Uh, I, ow!
[14166.88s -> 14168.80s]  Who is this?
[14168.80s -> 14170.44s]  Khartoum demands.
[14170.48s -> 14171.72s]  His high-pitched voice
[14171.72s -> 14175.92s]  is an odd contrast to his grim face.
[14175.92s -> 14179.80s]  That's, this is, it's, I, zip!
[14179.80s -> 14181.59s]  Who is this?
[14181.59s -> 14182.83s]  Khartoum demands.
[14182.83s -> 14186.80s]  His high-pitched voice is an odd contrast to his grim face.
[14186.80s -> 14187.80s]  Wait!
[14187.80s -> 14191.49s]  He snaps before one of the guards can speak.
[14191.49s -> 14195.48s]  This is almost certainly the Anilander.
[14195.48s -> 14197.38s]  Yeah, it's true.
[14197.38s -> 14198.34s]  It's true.
[14198.34s -> 14199.96s]  What can I say?
[14199.96s -> 14202.92s]  The captain has taken aback.
[14202.92s -> 14205.70s]  I did not expect you to admit it.
[14205.70s -> 14210.00s]  The tales of your cunning are obviously exaggerated.
[14210.00s -> 14210.84s]  Are they?
[14213.04s -> 14215.67s]  He sighs.
[14215.67s -> 14218.48s]  It would appear so, yes.
[14218.48s -> 14223.32s]  I should have you killed as fast as possible.
[14223.32s -> 14224.96s]  Why don't you try it then?
[14224.96s -> 14227.88s]  What are you gonna do?
[14227.88s -> 14233.30s]  He stares back at you and you see fear creeping at his eyes.
[14233.30s -> 14236.21s]  They tell the strangest stories about you.
[14236.21s -> 14237.13s]  They say, for instance,
[14237.13s -> 14240.20s]  that you are over a thousand years old.
[14240.20s -> 14242.84s]  They say you destroyed the village of Kariyama
[14242.84s -> 14246.56s]  in retribution for giving birth to the Archmage.
[14246.56s -> 14251.70s]  They say you laid waste to the ancient world.
[14251.70s -> 14255.92s]  Yeah, it's all true.
[14255.92s -> 14257.77s]  You want to take a step forward?
[14257.77s -> 14259.11s]  Huh?
[14259.11s -> 14260.32s]  Bud?
[14260.32s -> 14261.58s]  Buddy?
[14261.58s -> 14262.42s]  Hey, pal.
[14262.42s -> 14263.26s]  Hey, Bud.
[14263.26s -> 14264.28s]  Step forward.
[14264.28s -> 14265.24s]  It's all true.
[14265.24s -> 14266.44s]  Bud?
[14266.44s -> 14267.64s]  Hey, Bud.
[14267.64s -> 14268.48s]  Why don't you take a step?
[14268.48s -> 14269.36s]  Take one step forward.
[14269.36s -> 14270.20s]  Do it.
[14270.20s -> 14271.44s]  Any of you, all three of you in the room.
[14271.44s -> 14272.59s]  Hey, Bud.
[14272.59s -> 14274.07s]  Step forward.
[14274.07s -> 14277.03s]  It's all true.
[14277.03s -> 14279.69s]  Perhaps.
[14279.69s -> 14282.05s]  In the end, I am a soldier.
[14282.05s -> 14284.81s]  I believe I can run you through with a sword.
[14284.81s -> 14286.21s]  And if you get up again afterwards,
[14286.21s -> 14288.49s]  I believe I can run you through again.
[14288.49s -> 14291.25s]  I believe that if I toss you into our highest cell,
[14291.25s -> 14294.64s]  you will not fly away.
[14294.64s -> 14296.56s]  If you kill me,
[14296.56s -> 14301.82s]  I will come back for you.
[14301.82s -> 14305.57s]  Well now,
[14305.57s -> 14309.45s]  you really are as black hearted as they say, aren't you?
[14309.45s -> 14312.41s]  Oh, we'd better then put this immortality of yours
[14312.41s -> 14313.90s]  to the test.
[14313.90s -> 14315.42s]  Guards, take him to the block
[14315.42s -> 14319.30s]  and don't waste another moment of my time.
[14319.86s -> 14321.22s]  You yank one arm free,
[14321.22s -> 14322.82s]  then leap towards Khartoum.
[14322.82s -> 14325.14s]  But the guards will not fail to protect their leader.
[14325.14s -> 14328.79s]  They soon have your arms twisted up behind your back.
[14328.79s -> 14331.62s]  The commander is grimacing.
[14331.62s -> 14334.28s]  Get this one out of my office.
[14334.28s -> 14336.68s]  Remove his head and bring it back to me.
[14336.68s -> 14339.28s]  I need somewhere to keep my pencils.
[14341.01s -> 14346.90s]  How does that sound, Mr. Strong guy?
[14346.90s -> 14351.89s]  When I come back, I'm gonna eat you.
[14351.89s -> 14355.23s]  I'm gonna eat you.
[14355.23s -> 14359.20s]  Get him out of here.
[14359.20s -> 14361.08s]  Your head bumps over the cobblestones
[14361.08s -> 14365.02s]  as you are dragged up to a rough wooden block.
[14365.02s -> 14369.00s]  A massive man, shirtless, but masked,
[14369.00s -> 14371.88s]  lounges in the shadow of the wall with an ax.
[14371.88s -> 14375.36s]  The guards call him over.
[14375.36s -> 14377.44s]  Welcome.
[14377.44s -> 14380.67s]  Always nice to see a new face.
[14380.67s -> 14382.35s]  What would your name be?
[14382.35s -> 14388.81s]  Then hate to have a face without a name.
[14388.81s -> 14393.99s]  I am No-One.
[14393.99s -> 14396.08s]  You don't say.
[14396.08s -> 14399.37s]  I've never met No-One.
[14399.37s -> 14403.88s]  Soon you'll be Bloody Nobody as well.
[14403.88s -> 14407.22s]  He he he he he.
[14407.22s -> 14409.22s]  Grrrr.
[14409.22s -> 14411.40s]  Oh, what's that?
[14411.40s -> 14413.68s]  You look up.
[14413.68s -> 14415.12s]  You turn and look but see nothing
[14415.12s -> 14418.68s]  but the sunlight gleaming off a high tower window.
[14418.68s -> 14421.17s]  Yes, we lost.
[14421.17s -> 14422.88s]  At once we lost.
[14422.88s -> 14425.82s]  The large man says to the empty air.
[14425.82s -> 14428.68s]  Then he turns back to you.
[14428.68s -> 14430.36s]  Order's been given.
[14430.36s -> 14434.35s]  Yeah, well, doesn't look good for you.
[14434.35s -> 14436.63s]  He scoops you up and positions you on the block,
[14436.63s -> 14441.24s]  securing an iron band around at the base of your neck.
[14441.24s -> 14445.98s]  Forgive him.
[14445.98s -> 14447.38s]  I forgive you.
[14447.38s -> 14450.52s]  You murmur as he raises his blade.
[14450.52s -> 14453.16s]  The executioner smiles at you.
[14453.16s -> 14455.04s]  Very decent of you.
[14455.04s -> 14457.89s]  Here's my own forgiveness in return.
[14457.89s -> 14459.59s]  The ax comes down.
[14459.59s -> 14462.52s]  You've been executed.
[14462.52s -> 14464.52s]  Ow!
[14464.52s -> 14466.21s]  Oh!
[14466.21s -> 14471.50s]  Oh!
[14471.50s -> 14480.60s]  Zed.
[14480.60s -> 14482.76s]  Spell finishes in a blinding net of starlight
[14482.76s -> 14487.82s]  that winds around your body like a sheet.
[14487.82s -> 14492.18s]  And here we are.
[14492.18s -> 14495.48s]  Now I sprint to the commander's office and go,
[14495.48s -> 14498.48s]  surprise, you fucking bastard.
[14498.48s -> 14500.36s]  Kill me again.
[14500.36s -> 14501.36s]  Do it again.
[14501.36s -> 14502.67s]  Come on.
[14502.67s -> 14503.67s]  Oh, wait.
[14503.67s -> 14509.26s]  He won't remember.
[14509.26s -> 14510.26s]  He actually won't remember.
[14510.26s -> 14511.82s]  I forgot.
[14511.82s -> 14514.19s]  Told you I'd come back.
[14514.19s -> 14515.19s]  Who are you?
[14515.19s -> 14516.19s]  We've never met before.
[14516.19s -> 14520.37s]  I told you when I came back I was going to eat you.
[14520.37s -> 14521.37s]  Why?
[14521.37s -> 14522.37s]  What did I do?
[14522.37s -> 14529.12s]  Why are you doing this?
[14529.12s -> 14531.55s]  I don't even know who you are.
[14531.55s -> 14532.55s]  He knows about you, though.
[14532.55s -> 14535.39s]  Yeah.
[14535.39s -> 14536.39s]  All right.
[14536.39s -> 14539.23s]  I'm going to call it here.
[14539.23s -> 14541.36s]  Let's go to bed.
[14541.36s -> 14542.80s]  Let's go to sleep.
[14542.80s -> 14549.52s]  I don't have any rations or anything, but it's okay.
[14549.52s -> 14551.52s]  He lost a little max stamina.
[14551.52s -> 14553.52s]  Changed to using the Cutlass.
[14553.52s -> 14555.52s]  Discarded your disguise.
[14555.52s -> 14556.52s]  Died again.
[14556.52s -> 14557.52s]  And found no—
[14557.52s -> 14558.52s]  He still doesn't know?
[14558.52s -> 14559.76s]  What?
[14559.76s -> 14560.76s]  How?
[14560.76s -> 14562.64s]  What?
[14562.64s -> 14563.64s]  All right, this one here.
[14563.64s -> 14565.64s]  You want me to chop this one's head off?
[14565.64s -> 14567.94s]  Yes, I would like for you to kill that man.
[14567.94s -> 14568.94s]  I'm the Archmage.
[14568.94s -> 14569.94s]  All right, this one here.
[14569.94s -> 14570.94s]  The Islandlander.
[14570.94s -> 14571.94s]  This guy right here.
[14571.94s -> 14572.94s]  The guy?
[14572.94s -> 14573.94s]  Yes, that's the man.
[14573.94s -> 14574.94s]  Okay.
[14574.94s -> 14578.23s]  You're not aware of him, though.
[14578.23s -> 14580.81s]  He doesn't know.
[14580.81s -> 14581.81s]  But, yes.
[14581.81s -> 14582.81s]  Episode 4.
[14582.81s -> 14587.81s]  The reason why a lot of people don't like Episode 4 is because they got rid of rewinds
[14587.81s -> 14592.24s]  and they make you have to stick with decisions, and you're going to get it wrong, and you're
[14592.24s -> 14594.55s]  going to have to come back over and over again.
[14594.55s -> 14604.00s]  So, it kind of turns the game into a little bit of a roguelike, which is okay, but if
[14604.00s -> 14610.74s]  you make a mistake up here, or like in here, or over here, the fact that you have to rewind
[14610.74s -> 14617.86s]  all the way to here is where this part gets a little grating.
[14617.86s -> 14619.86s]  I hate dealing with the consequences of my actions.
[14619.86s -> 14622.64s]  Yeah.
[14622.64s -> 14626.96s]  But, we have played this enough where I know.
[14626.96s -> 14631.89s]  I know a lot of the major beats and how to get to them.
[14631.89s -> 14634.58s]  Everything in between is kind of gone, though.
[14634.58s -> 14639.25s]  I still love this franchise.
[14639.25s -> 14641.25s]  I think it's one of the best games ever made.
[14641.25s -> 14642.88s]  I just do.
[14642.88s -> 14644.31s]  Not because it's...
[14644.31s -> 14652.54s]  I mean, it's like essentially one of the foundations of kind of like video game RPG type storytelling
[14652.54s -> 14654.16s]  stuff.
[14654.16s -> 14656.34s]  So, I love it, and we're going to finish it.
[14656.34s -> 14659.80s]  I hope you all enjoyed it.
[14659.80s -> 14665.19s]  Enjoy the rest of your long weekend here.
[14665.19s -> 14669.49s]  Tomorrow is the 4th, okay?
[14669.49s -> 14671.92s]  So, let me take a look at the calendar.
[14671.92s -> 14677.81s]  You can expect to see me again probably like mid to late week.
[14677.81s -> 14679.82s]  Let me see.
[14679.82s -> 14682.21s]  Probably like Friday.
[14682.21s -> 14683.21s]  Friday makes sense.
[14683.21s -> 14686.18s]  Come back on Friday.
[14686.18s -> 14691.12s]  And, I think I'm not going to do sorcery.
[14691.12s -> 14696.20s]  We're either going to do Armored Core or something else.
[14696.20s -> 14699.38s]  But, Armored Core is currently the first thing that's first up.
[14699.38s -> 14708.04s]  What about Starfield?
[14708.04s -> 14711.01s]  Yeah.
[14711.01s -> 14713.08s]  I don't know.
[14713.08s -> 14719.44s]  I don't think I've...
[14719.44s -> 14722.44s]  I thought about it a little bit more and right now.
[14722.44s -> 14726.03s]  I'm not sure I want to start Starfield right now.
[14726.03s -> 14729.04s]  That's a massive game.
[14729.04s -> 14736.06s]  Um, does that really matter?
[14736.06s -> 14739.68s]  Considering the philosophy of the kind of channel now.
[14739.68s -> 14741.92s]  Like, does that really matter?
[14741.92s -> 14744.80s]  Oh, it's going to take too long.
[14744.80s -> 14746.56s]  It'll...
[14746.56s -> 14748.56s]  It's too much to hang out and sit through.
[14748.56s -> 14749.56s]  Does that really matter?
[14749.56s -> 14759.50s]  What about Final Fantasy XVI?
[14759.50s -> 14762.38s]  I actually got the urge to play that.
[14762.38s -> 14764.94s]  I want to say like three or four days ago.
[14764.94s -> 14766.76s]  It's just...
[14766.76s -> 14767.76s]  It's such a...
[14767.76s -> 14769.76s]  It's another one of those games that's like 30, 40, 50 hours.
[14769.76s -> 14772.83s]  I just need the opportunity to sit down and do it.
[14772.83s -> 14773.83s]  But, I did get the urge to play it.
[14773.83s -> 14775.58s]  I did really like it.
[14775.58s -> 14779.57s]  So, we'll see.
[14779.57s -> 14781.57s]  But, I know for a fact that I'm playing Armored Core.
[14781.57s -> 14782.57s]  At least.
[14782.57s -> 14784.26s]  So, we'll do that on Friday.
[14784.26s -> 14786.91s]  And, we'll see.
[14786.91s -> 14787.91s]  We'll go from there.
[14787.91s -> 14790.24s]  Finish Breath of the Wild.
[14790.24s -> 14796.04s]  I promise you, I will complete Breath of the Wild at some point before...
[14796.04s -> 14797.28s]  Um, I don't know.
[14797.28s -> 14801.48s]  I don't want to eat a glove or eat like a shoe or something.
[14801.48s -> 14803.72s]  Um, I'll just play it eventually.
[14803.72s -> 14808.22s]  You'll see it.
[14808.22s -> 14815.43s]  At some point means nothing, sir.
[14815.43s -> 14820.53s]  Hey, the Sorcery Council said that for a year.
[14820.53s -> 14829.28s]  Turns out it wasn't true.
[14829.28s -> 14830.28s]  All right.
[14830.28s -> 14831.28s]  I'll see you guys later.
[14831.28s -> 14832.28s]  Thanks for watching.
[14832.28s -> 14833.28s]  Thanks for hanging out.
[14833.28s -> 14835.16s]  Have a good rest of your weekend.
[14835.16s -> 14838.71s]  See you guys on Friday.
[14838.71s -> 14839.71s]  Take care of yourselves.
[14839.71s -> 14852.60s]  Call your mother.
[14852.60s -> 14859.00s]  See you later.
[14859.00s -> 14860.76s]  Have a great evening.
[14860.76s -> 14861.93s]  Oh, also too.
[14861.93s -> 14862.93s]  I do want to mention this very briefly.
[14862.93s -> 14866.67s]  If you remember the GoFundMe that we were raising.
[14866.67s -> 14867.67s]  Well, not we were raising.
[14867.67s -> 14870.67s]  But, like I brought up about the Science Center.
[14870.67s -> 14875.94s]  Terrible tragedy that struck that family.
[14875.94s -> 14880.88s]  Uh, the GoFundMe goal has been crossed.
[14880.88s -> 14884.44s]  As of, I believe, pretty, pretty quickly.
[14884.44s -> 14892.32s]  So, that was, I mean, that was at least 15 to 20 grand that came through from this community.
[14892.32s -> 14895.88s]  So, I just want to say thanks.
[14895.88s -> 14898.88s]  Um, that's amazing to give.
[14898.88s -> 14902.00s]  I'm just happy that that goal can be crossed.
[14902.00s -> 14905.95s]  Uh, again, it's a really awful scenario.
[14905.95s -> 14910.32s]  But, just trying to put, um, just put some attention on it.
[14910.32s -> 14915.27s]  Because, uh, the Science Center people were a huge part of the GrottoBeast stuff.
[14915.27s -> 14929.20s]  So, I just want to say thanks.
[14929.20s -> 14930.64s]  Have a great night.
[14930.64s -> 14933.60s]  Take care of yourselves.
[14933.60s -> 14935.61s]  Have a great one.
[14935.61s -> 14952.34s]  And good night.
[14952.34s -> 14954.34s]  Also, mods, if you want to give a little context for people that don't know what I'm talking about.
[14954.34s -> 14957.73s]  Maybe link the GoFundMe.
[14957.73s -> 14961.87s]  Just for those of you that don't know what I'm talking about here.
[14961.87s -> 14965.52s]  The GoFundMe that was set up.
[14965.52s -> 14969.06s]  That we got our attention to.
[14969.06s -> 14970.81s]  Somebody brought it to our attention.
[14970.81s -> 14974.70s]  And just wanted to give it some attention.
[14974.70s -> 14978.18s]  Take care.
[14978.18s -> 14979.55s]  Good night.
[14979.55s -> 14981.55s]  See you soon.
