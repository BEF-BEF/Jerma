[0.31s -> 12.10s]  Just made it. Just barely made it. I got that window. Between 3 and 4 p.m. Pacific.
[12.66s -> 29.05s]  340. Last stream. 350. Stream before that. 315. 359. I'm here to do the work. Uh, back to VR.
[30.30s -> 40.95s]  Welcome everybody. Hope you had a good few days here. This last few days. Proud of you. Hey.
[43.27s -> 51.40s]  Thanks. Everybody was talking about politics and I said don't do that.
[54.26s -> 62.18s]  They're right. Don't do that. Some of you may be noticing. Hold on. We'll wait. Hold on a second.
[63.24s -> 104.20s]  Give me a second. Hold on. You find yourself unable to cast sus because the stream is live.
[108.30s -> 118.04s]  But yes. Back to VR. Sure you're noticing, like I said before, uh, did somebody install
[118.04s -> 127.82s]  a certain add-on for Twitch? It might be something here. Let's take a look.
[135.06s -> 149.35s]  BTTV. I got it. And I added a peepo dance. Uh, Sticks Renegade. Thanks for the 50 bucks. And
[149.35s -> 161.46s]  they say hey, tax return stream. Tax return stream. Hold on. Let me see. I can't even
[161.46s -> 165.86s]  hear this. Hold on. I'm not going to be able to play this because I have my Vive audio
[165.86s -> 171.58s]  going through the Vive. Hold on. Can I hear it like through the Vive? Let me see if I can
[171.58s -> 180.94s]  hear this through the Vive. Oh, I can. That's really low though. What the hell? That's so
[180.94s -> 196.26s]  strange. Yeah, let's try it again. You want to see my tax returns? All right. Remind me,
[196.26s -> 201.14s]  in 2019, we'll take a look at my tax returns and we'll see how much money I get paid.
[203.54s -> 211.69s]  It's zero. See? That's because everyone was giving me shit. I'm not going to show you
[211.69s -> 218.42s]  guys my fucking tax returns. That was like a jokey, funny little jokey thing about how
[218.50s -> 225.06s]  you're playing Octogeddon too much. Therefore, somebody had to pay you to do it. That wasn't
[225.06s -> 239.26s]  even true. Okay, remind me in like 2021 that I'll show you a receipt. I'll show you like a
[239.26s -> 245.59s]  business receipt. You can clip that if you want. All right, here we go. We're going to
[245.59s -> 253.27s]  start with Duck Season. I don't know what this is. I know this is like a scary game.
[253.27s -> 258.39s]  That's what I've been told. Why don't we like get on camera? Get that out of here.
[258.95s -> 265.19s]  Hey, would you look at that? There he is. He's back and he's got his workout gear. Yep.
[266.63s -> 276.06s]  The shirt's back. It actually feels pretty good when you have it on. We got a full 3D
[276.06s -> 281.75s]  motion here, right? Make sure you can see more than you could. Don't touch that thing,
[281.75s -> 287.27s]  though. Don't touch that. The whole thing will probably explode if I put my hands on that.
[289.74s -> 293.90s]  So, I'm going to get in. Hold on. Is my shit all together here?
[293.90s -> 302.79s]  I think it is. Can you guys hear this? Is this sound? No. Does this have sound?
[305.61s -> 315.34s]  That got sound, right? Okay, yeah. Good. All right, I got the chat too. I'm ready to go in.
[316.06s -> 326.44s]  Just give me a minute. My head in frame. Wait a minute. Hold on. Activate the clap
[326.44s -> 332.52s]  emote. And then they called me the B word. Well, that should help a little bit with
[333.16s -> 346.86s]  the helmet. All right, let's go. I didn't even get a sip of coffee. Don't you? Okay.
[348.30s -> 352.70s]  I know I stall when I play VR, but you have to remember something. Once I go in here,
[353.98s -> 362.92s]  I can't even breathe until I come out. You can't take a sip of a drink.
[363.72s -> 371.35s]  You can't eat anything. You can barely move. Here we go. Duck season is what we're starting
[371.35s -> 381.94s]  with. It's a real boomer game. I remember Duck Hunt. Yeah, I used to flash the screen.
[381.94s -> 388.06s]  It was fucking crazy. All right. Hold on. Where's my headset? Why does this feel tighter?
[388.62s -> 407.42s]  Oh shit. Oh shit. It's because Kim was playing this. I got to adjust. Not yet. Hold on.
[414.65s -> 419.29s]  Yes. Yes. The question. I'll answer that question for you. Sure. Yes. Me and my
[419.29s -> 425.05s]  girlfriend had a VR date night. I took her on a date in virtual reality. It's very expensive
[425.05s -> 433.16s]  to go places. It's called dinner date. You get to order the most expensive wine. You get to have
[433.16s -> 438.86s]  the most expensive food and I could just sit in the corner over there and just be like this.
[438.86s -> 445.34s]  Like, yeah, it's nice. And she's like, wow, hold on. Wait, you took me. You took me here.
[445.34s -> 448.22s]  She's looking around with like on vacation and shit. It's best bucket program you could ever
[448.22s -> 459.22s]  have. This is the nicest restaurant in the city. Yeah. Yes, it is. Okay. Hold on. Hey,
[459.22s -> 464.18s]  what do you think about that? Boyfriend of the year, right? And then I go in like for a kiss
[464.18s -> 476.38s]  and it's like, cause she can't see me. So it's like, oh yeah, thanks honey. I need to put these.
[480.28s -> 492.62s]  I can't see. I can't see anything. Come on. Is this left or right? I got to ask you guys.
[495.03s -> 508.07s]  I might have to put this into the camera. What a stalling asshole. I can't. I feel like
[508.07s -> 519.32s]  I'm looking through a microscope. Which one is this? Come on. That's left. This one's left.
[520.33s -> 534.17s]  This one's right. All right. I'm ready. This text is red now. Yeah. What about it? All right.
[534.17s -> 549.78s]  Let's take a look at volume. That sounds a little low to me. Hold on. Where's my mouse?
[560.04s -> 567.58s]  I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it. Hold on. There we go. That's what
[567.58s -> 573.30s]  I'm talking about. That's much better. How's that sound? It's probably a little too loud.
[574.18s -> 585.50s]  All right. Now let's test that out. Loud. Hold on. Do you tell me better? That's probably
[585.50s -> 594.41s]  fine, right? That's good. That's fine. All right. Difficulty medium. Uh,
[598.06s -> 602.65s]  dominant hand is the right hand. I was going to say Dalmatian. Well, light gun,
[603.37s -> 609.85s]  peripheral disabled, adaptive quality on. I don't know what this any of this means.
[609.85s -> 618.84s]  Just go new game medium. Uh, normal hunter here for the game. Okay.
[619.48s -> 629.38s]  Anyway, I'd have to stay in somewhere specific. Stress level zero. Life is strange.
[629.38s -> 637.29s]  Dibs make this game the kid that wants to be a superhero. Mom? They carry in these groceries.
[639.77s -> 651.05s]  Oh, you got duck season. One day rental. So make the most of it. Oh, I will.
[651.37s -> 666.54s]  Well, it's kind of loud. It's loud as fuck. All right. Hold on. It's loud as fuck.
[667.50s -> 689.77s]  I'll take care of it. All right. Hey hunters, it's duck season. So that means we got a lot
[689.77s -> 695.21s]  of first time hunters out there. How to use your shotgun today. All our shotguns come
[695.21s -> 700.86s]  preloaded. So to start shooting, all you gotta do is aim it and pull the trigger.
[700.94s -> 705.26s]  Now to keep shooting. All you gotta do is place your hand on the pump of the shotgun
[707.34s -> 709.66s]  now you got another round in the chamber and you're ready to shoot.
[712.68s -> 717.96s]  Just like that. Now reloading your shotgun is easy. All you gotta do is put your hand up,
[719.16s -> 724.52s]  summon a shell from your box and put that baby into the chamber underneath the shotgun.
[724.60s -> 728.60s]  And pump it one more time and you're ready to go again.
[730.12s -> 735.80s]  Now professional hunters, they like to keep their shotgun topped off. So each time you fire
[735.80s -> 740.36s]  up a round and you have a second, you know, put a baby in there. Keep yourself prepared for
[740.36s -> 743.80s]  the amount of ducks that we flying at you. They'll be coming from everywhere from the left
[744.44s -> 749.80s]  to the right. They're everywhere, man. So I hope you guys learn something. And remember,
[749.88s -> 755.32s]  first rule of gun safety is have fun. Cause remember it's duck season.
[780.06s -> 784.54s]  Hey hunters, it's duck season. So that means we got a lot of first time hunters out there.
[784.54s -> 788.54s]  I'm going to teach you how to use your shotgun today. All our shotguns come preloaded.
[789.50s -> 796.06s]  All you gotta do is aim it and pull the trigger. Now to keep shooting. All you gotta do is place
[796.06s -> 801.10s]  your hand on the pump of the shotgun and rack that baby. Now you got another round
[801.10s -> 810.60s]  in the chamber and you're ready to shoot. Whoa, a banana. It's huge. What kind of
[810.60s -> 821.43s]  mutant world are we living in? Why are these so big? I used to have a cup like this.
[821.43s -> 839.64s]  All right. Stop. Okay. Just play. How do I play level one? Oh, I got a level one.
[848.79s -> 868.36s]  It's lagging. Is it Cox? It's not doing that on my end. Oh, it's just, really? Oh,
[868.36s -> 883.91s]  it's a drop of frames. Fuck. The line controllers pulled trigger. I'm not getting any like
[883.91s -> 890.34s]  hardware lag. Let me just check and see how many frames I've dropped. It's never easy,
[890.34s -> 910.46s]  is it? It's never easy. Okay, just play a goddamn game. Oh, shit. No, it is. Like,
[910.46s -> 924.86s]  what the fuck is going on here? Hold on. My CPU is going like nuts. Why? I didn't change
[924.86s -> 945.21s]  anything from last time. I got nothing else going on in the background here. Let
[945.21s -> 951.22s]  me just do one thing real quick here. No, I got like, yeah, I got like an encoding issue.
[951.94s -> 959.24s]  What the fuck? It's BTTV. Better twitch.tv. I'm going to have to, I might have to restart
[959.24s -> 972.41s]  three. Why? No, OBS had a fucking major update today. There was a major OBS update today
[972.41s -> 983.99s]  that I think may have caused me a problem. Fuck. Oh, I'm going to change to the other
[983.99s -> 988.36s]  codec. Streams going to turn off. Tell me how this works. I'll be right back.
[990.73s -> 1019.27s]  I'll be right back. Hello? How's it look? My CPU has dropped by an insane amount.
[1023.82s -> 1029.42s]  Yeah, OBS had a pretty major update today and I just changed it to like hardware codec.
[1029.42s -> 1036.50s]  That's the first time I've had to do that in like three years. Okay, well, sorry about that.
[1036.50s -> 1041.80s]  That was weird. Didn't expect an update to do that, but let me know if it keeps going or
[1041.80s -> 1049.85s]  anything else happens. Wait, I got an opportunity to drink an iced coffee. Yeah,
[1049.85s -> 1063.34s]  I was, OBS was at like 60% CPU. Now it's at 11%. Okey dokey. Let's go. Let's actually
[1063.34s -> 1096.76s]  play. All right. Duck season. All right. Put your hand here and then pump. Okay, just make
[1096.76s -> 1109.18s]  sure. Grab a shell. Force grab a shell. How many do I have in there? It's wicked loud.
[1114.06s -> 1121.32s]  Fucking Vive, man. I need like a tech director to play Vive. All right. Round one. Ready?
[1121.32s -> 1169.53s]  Just lower your volume for like five minutes. This is actually really fun.
[1170.49s -> 1184.98s]  So they're gonna get, does Nintendo like get angry with them for them?
[1184.98s -> 1202.97s]  I can see Nintendo getting angry with them. Okay, come on. I'm pretty good at these kind
[1202.97s -> 1229.94s]  of games. Throw like more than one at me. Got it. All right. Round two. Ready?
[1232.50s -> 1234.50s]  Actually, Nintendo's about to shut the screen down.
[1236.74s -> 1247.64s]  Lower the volume. All right. Hold on a minute here. Let me lower the fucking volume. This
[1247.72s -> 1269.53s]  is probably like unbearable. There you go. All right. Round two. I think I'm getting
[1269.53s -> 1276.39s]  the hang of this. See now it's horrible. Let me load the shotgun up a little bit here.
[1276.39s -> 1297.24s]  How many can fit in there? One, two, three, four, five. Okay. Bring it on. Fuck!
[1302.12s -> 1325.03s]  It's all right. I feel like I'm playing Diner Dash. Didn't even need to look, did I?
[1325.67s -> 1338.17s]  Oh, this is fucking fun. Can I like not even do the horror movie part? Can I just do this?
[1349.70s -> 1354.07s]  A little bit. Okay. Those are the ducks that I... I thought I was getting like creepered over
[1354.07s -> 1368.87s]  here. All right. Is it loaded? I don't need to reach. You know. Make it louder. Turn around.
[1372.79s -> 1411.98s]  What? Oh, look at me! Oh, nope. I ain't gonna do that. I ain't gonna do that one.
[1412.54s -> 1451.88s]  Look out. Oh, look at me! I don't have to do that. I have to though. It's VR.
[1460.12s -> 1471.67s]  Two more. What do I get for ranking? That's gotta be at least like a D. Is that at least a D?
[1483.45s -> 1517.06s]  Quickly! Quick! God damn it! Come on. Where's my mouse? Like around the back. Now I have to do
[1517.06s -> 1525.51s]  that, right? Okay. If you shot a shotgun that close to somebody's head, their hearing would be
[1525.51s -> 1531.53s]  gone for the rest of their life. That would be like a bang. Like the whole... Everybody would
[1531.53s -> 1551.59s]  be like going like this. How's that? Turn up the volume. Turn down the volume. Turn up the
[1551.59s -> 1570.87s]  volume. Turn down the volume. Turn up the volume. Look at me! Hey, Mom! Okay. I am against a wall.
[1570.87s -> 1576.15s]  This is fucking weird. I'm actually like sitting here like this. What wall is this?
[1581.08s -> 1590.18s]  Mom, can I have soda? Uh, duck season loading level two. Let's go.
[1593.05s -> 1601.14s]  Now it's as fucking loud as shit. Okay. Turn it up. Turn it down. Turn it up. Turn it down.
[1601.14s -> 1608.86s]  Turn it up. Turn it down. I've already watched this. Oh! That was perfect, isn't it?
[1612.42s -> 1620.23s]  Jeremy, I think you might need to adjust the game volume. Just a little. It's so loud.
[1621.43s -> 1628.07s]  I gotta get... I can't. Alright, I'm gonna go to like the steep... No, I'm gonna go back out and...
[1636.86s -> 1643.02s]  It's hard. Just turn your volume slider down. I usually have really quiet streams.
[1643.02s -> 1681.67s]  Just like turn the slider down for one. The fire? Use language. Use steam menu for volume.
[1691.48s -> 1696.84s]  Everybody use hand signals to communicate with him. Oh, no. He's... Oh, no. He's wearing
[1696.84s -> 1709.22s]  iPods. He can't hear us. Right? Let's keep the stream going.
[1726.20s -> 1754.81s]  Let me get times 10. I'll be happy. I can sense it. I can feel ultra instinct.
[1755.21s -> 1801.30s]  Round three. Is it gonna get three ducks at the same time? Gotta keep a rhythm going.
[1802.02s -> 1825.22s]  It's alright. It's okay. It's alright. I got it. What an absolute turret. Time's at 2 a.m.
[1825.94s -> 1839.72s]  Only 1995. Duck food? I'm not killing ducks, am I? This is just supposed to be a computer
[1839.72s -> 1844.17s]  game. This is not supposed to be real. What else we got here? Oh, thanks!
[1852.95s -> 1876.71s]  Thanks, Mom! Did she get angry? What the fuck? I've got a frisbee. Oh, who hasn't done this yet?
[1878.02s -> 1882.50s]  Dude, I watched a guy play duck season and I swear to God he started throwing stuff at the
[1882.50s -> 1916.41s]  mom. What? But did they hit her in the head? Spoilers. I spoiled it for myself. It's okay.
[1921.06s -> 1932.71s]  Advanced level. Oh, fuck. He went far. Come on, give me a...
[1932.71s -> 1965.46s]  Here we go. Round one. Oh, what a bad joke. Like, I snorted the bullet and I just broke my vibe.
[1966.50s -> 1999.42s]  Fucking idiot. Perfect. That's fine with me.
[2002.79s -> 2054.73s]  3,333 viewers. It's a sign. That means, right? I gotta pay attention. The sun is bright.
[2055.53s -> 2068.14s]  Ah, shut up, Jeremy. Make the shots. Bad. Bad. He's bad. I'm not in the right place.
[2068.86s -> 2124.62s]  Sign, R. Get a letter. Damn. Pretty good. Eat the shells. No, I already almost hurt myself.
[2127.62s -> 2174.18s]  Did Jeremy already do the shoot the dog joke? Yes. What the fuck? That was pretty good.
[2175.06s -> 2188.57s]  That's pretty good. What? I got it. What for, huh? Oh, I got it! Look!
[2189.29s -> 2209.93s]  How does it work? What? No, I want to shoot the thing. Come on, man. Oh, I can do it again.
[2209.93s -> 2234.78s]  I can't let go of it. How do I let go? You've seen anybody do that before?
[2234.78s -> 2247.93s]  That's pretty good fan physics. Would you like this when you were a kid?
[2249.21s -> 2256.34s]  I don't know. Probably. I did it with a beat.
[2257.86s -> 2263.70s]  All right, it's going to be probably harder. I'm ready.
[2293.80s -> 2297.40s]  Okay, by the way, this shirt stinks like a dirty laundry basket.
[2298.12s -> 2303.03s]  I can't. It's fucking me up. It was in the laundry, I think, for too long,
[2303.03s -> 2308.55s]  and it has that dirty inside of a gym bag smell. Oh, it's fucking with me.
[2319.77s -> 2326.28s]  Just fucking put one in. I swear to God, I'm ripping this shirt in half.
[2326.28s -> 2342.54s]  It stinks in here. It's not me. It's the shirt. It's not me. It's not me. It's like
[2342.54s -> 2347.90s]  it was in the laundry for too long, and it didn't get dried fast enough,
[2347.90s -> 2352.76s]  and now it has that smelly. I thought somebody just like fucking hacked me.
[2363.61s -> 2371.96s]  It's filling my nostrils every time I breathe in. It's not me.
[2372.84s -> 2378.28s]  It's because I started to get some moisture going through the shirt.
[2379.08s -> 2421.64s]  Everybody relax. Change shirt. Not yet. I deserve this. That's a pretty good tactic right there.
[2421.64s -> 2451.32s]  Let's go. Ain't going to go through the fucking tree on me. Did he? Good to go.
[2452.94s -> 2456.54s]  I'm watching in spell-o-vision, and this is unbearable. Please change shirt.
[2465.02s -> 2468.78s]  Yeah, just go get like a piece of dirty laundry and just put it in your face.
[2468.78s -> 2474.23s]  What the hell is going on now? All right. Okay. I'm going to close my eyes,
[2474.23s -> 2477.51s]  and wherever this lands, that's exactly where I'm going to take my next vacation. Ready?
[2477.51s -> 2514.49s]  One, two, three. Can you stop? Does it stop? I don't think it stops. It doesn't stop.
[2521.59s -> 2529.48s]  That's nowhere. All right. Where am I going? That's a huge piece of pizza.
[2529.48s -> 2534.79s]  No, don't do this to me. This looks like really good. I know this is like actually
[2534.79s -> 2537.59s]  it's kind of like a dirty laundry pizza, but I still think it looks good.
[2537.83s -> 2542.94s]  I, you can actually take a bite out of it. Fucking game of the year. What's that?
[2542.94s -> 2555.98s]  Can I like, you want to bite the whole thing? Some dogs go to hell. Where is the gra- that's
[2555.98s -> 2564.81s]  fucking creepy. This says, uh, radical racers. Look, I just got to stand still like this,
[2564.81s -> 2567.69s]  and then I'll be able to know what direction that I, like, where the gravity is.
[2568.73s -> 2571.69s]  Okay, so gravity's going this way, so I'm standing on the wall this way.
[2571.77s -> 2595.00s]  So I'm like, like that. Okay. Can I wake myself up? I'm in a dream.
[2595.72s -> 2622.28s]  Holy shit, he's coming to get me. Where's the wall? What do you want, the knife?
[2622.84s -> 2644.04s]  A knife? Oh, ma. Shit, knife, right? But the throw. Don't make fun of my throw.
[2653.11s -> 2655.35s]  She's going to be like the- I'm going to have to like hide somewhere. She's
[2655.35s -> 2663.13s]  going to turn into a fucking monster. I guarantee it. Watch some dogs go to hell.
[2663.13s -> 2680.01s]  Go. That was your warning shot. I'm going to get a perfect. I'm going to get a perfect
[2680.01s -> 2706.94s]  or I'll shit my pants on spring. What an immature fucking thing to say. Give me a break.
[2707.74s -> 2726.31s]  Where'd you go? Oh, they disappear quickly.
[2740.52s -> 2750.63s]  Multiple shits. Every time. Next time, we'll do it next dream, guys. I'll just drink coffee
[2750.63s -> 2768.34s]  and eat soft cheeses. That's not appropriate for work. I can't do that. A lot of people
[2768.34s -> 2782.44s]  watch my stranger at work. Damn it. My boss heard you. That's what I'm saying. I got to
[2782.44s -> 2790.04s]  be more careful. Not applicable for work. One would say it's not safe to watch this dream
[2790.04s -> 2796.97s]  if you're at jobs. All right, now I got to come. I got to shut up. I was doing so good.
[2798.09s -> 2817.77s]  Do it. What the fuck are you doing? I'm trying to pump the damn thing.
[2821.13s -> 2840.95s]  I'm going to cry. I'm going to cry. I'm a teacher. Please don't swear in front of my
[2840.95s -> 2850.36s]  class. Why did you wheel a TV into the room and put my stream on? What are you teaching them
[2850.36s -> 2867.90s]  about? I guess so. I wrote this song a long time ago, but I guess they just realized
[2867.90s -> 2870.78s]  what it's all about. Mom just kind of walks back and forth, huh?
[2870.78s -> 2907.06s]  Beatsaber. There's no I in Iowa. We'll be right back.
[2911.83s -> 2921.56s]  What's that? Kazoo Kid. I kind of want to see what the Kazoo Kid is.
[2925.54s -> 2961.16s]  Do you see what your child is watching over here? Get involved. That's about enough of
[2961.16s -> 2980.89s]  that I can take. King bit game system level six. Dogs go to hell. Oh, right. Dogs go to
[2980.89s -> 3000.47s]  hell. I forgot about dogs go to hell. Just how many levels are in this game? I mean,
[3000.47s -> 3015.37s]  do I have to keep showing like my extreme skill set with the light gun? Don't pay attention
[3015.37s -> 3075.56s]  to that one. I'm not fucking around anymore. Watch this one. I just shit my pants on stream.
[3076.20s -> 3125.05s]  What just happened? I just think this control is broken. Here we go. I'm ready. Now you
[3125.05s -> 3130.98s]  motherfucker. I gotta like move. I think I'm not getting picked up by the sensor.
[3131.54s -> 3161.53s]  I should have got a triple right there too. I know like the kids right there. Check your
[3161.53s -> 3173.42s]  six. Tonight channels. All right. Where's uh, where's dogs go to hell? Watch that one next.
[3174.14s -> 3201.26s]  I mean, that's unbelievable. This is an ode to G mod. I don't want to watch that.
[3203.08s -> 3212.15s]  Time buddies. No, where's dogs go to hell? Treasure hunters. I don't know which one is
[3212.15s -> 3244.58s]  this? Right? Right? Right? Everybody funny, right? It's gonna take off. It's gonna fly away.
[3254.86s -> 3260.30s]  I just realized the Travelocity gnome just started to tap into like the young millennial
[3260.30s -> 3269.74s]  audience, right? Didn't even need to do anything. The Travelocity gnome just has to exist
[3269.74s -> 3288.36s]  and he'll be like hip still. They make a Travelocity commercial where he like pops up
[3288.36s -> 3292.89s]  on the screen and just goes like, Oh, all of you guys would fucking buy that insurance.
[3293.53s -> 3304.94s]  Right. Wait. No, you'd whatever it is. No, that's kind of okay. What about these other games here?
[3304.94s -> 3319.35s]  Hold on. This is duck season. What's this one? Whaling 1842. Do I have to play this?
[3324.76s -> 3362.55s]  Jesus. Oh my God. I think I lost. What are the other games? The whales win.
[3370.84s -> 3396.42s]  Triple Tiger. Triple Tiger. This is a shooting game. Okay. Um, I don't know. That's not
[3396.74s -> 3418.31s]  like a Pokemon scenario there. Remember your training. I have a gun. You go for a punch.
[3418.31s -> 3429.02s]  Oops. Go for a high kick. Gotta go for a punch. Low kick. Gotta go for a high punch.
[3429.02s -> 3450.95s]  I don't understand. It's like rock, paper, scissors. Battle. Oh, the Super Mario Brothers.
[3451.51s -> 3470.68s]  That's like Tropical Fruit Mario Brothers. It's just Flappy Bird. All right. Hold on.
[3470.68s -> 3513.51s]  Let me try this one again. It's just Flappy Bird. No. There's a lot of random games here, huh?
[3518.04s -> 3541.24s]  Desert Boss. Behind you. What? Mom, Mom, are you eating a pizza sandwich? That's a slice of
[3541.24s -> 3554.58s]  pizza on top of face down on a slice of pizza. What's wrong with you? I gotta wait. Where's
[3554.58s -> 3562.06s]  my, where'd it go? It just went into the machine. It just sucked in. See, look, Mom
[3562.06s -> 3566.06s]  took one of these, flipped it this way and put another one underneath that is eating that.
[3567.66s -> 3576.78s]  I've never, I actually want to do that. I'm going to try that. Okay. Uh, what happened to,
[3578.33s -> 3582.73s]  no, I don't want to play that stupid game. Okay. Somebody says blowing it.
[3583.53s -> 3599.19s]  I didn't do anything. There's a microphone up here. I don't know if it's like,
[3599.19s -> 3615.11s]  could have thought I was doing something. Get that out. Try harder. It's not going to,
[3616.94s -> 3627.82s]  no, I'm not fucking humoring you guys. That's not real. Pizza Boy. Wasn't there,
[3627.82s -> 3639.51s]  I was supposed to play another game. Hold on. How do you play Pizza Boy? How do you throw a
[3639.51s -> 3661.29s]  pizza? Is it like throw pizza? Oops. I don't know how to throw a pizza. Oh, I just like
[3661.29s -> 3678.17s]  killed that guy. Oopsie daisy. Just pulling a guy over. Sir, you know, I pulled you over.
[3679.40s -> 3683.96s]  I don't know. Is it, is it the 15 to 20 pizzas I've thrown up my driver's side window?
[3684.76s -> 3696.09s]  All right. That's it. What's that one? Hover junkers. What's this one? I gotta play Sinatra first.
[3696.89s -> 3720.22s]  Fucking weird lady. I don't get it. This one's actually kind of fun. Oops.
[3726.10s -> 3729.85s]  What's this one? You know what's really funny about this? This is like,
[3730.73s -> 3735.77s]  this is what we did three days ago. This is just me with like a dream cast or like a
[3735.77s -> 3740.57s]  PlayStation 2 or the PlayStation 1. What's the next one? What's up? I died once.
[3747.32s -> 3793.14s]  Yeah, guys, this was like $485. Did I lose? How do I reload? That was pretty good, man.
[3793.14s -> 3799.91s]  That was like 48 bucks. All right, let's go back to the real game. No, dogs go to hell.
[3799.91s -> 3815.94s]  Let's see what this one is like. That one's not safe for work. What's wrong with it?
[3816.50s -> 3836.42s]  I tried. I have no idea. All right. Back in the game. Let's get back into it.
[3842.74s -> 3850.38s]  Hey, dog. I haven't played in so long. I think I lost my muscle memory of how to play this game.
[3851.58s -> 3870.79s]  I gotta get the better spot. Yeah, it's the spot. It's doing it like this right there.
[3890.90s -> 3897.24s]  Got four coming out at the same time now. I got an issue here. I got like a wardrobe
[3897.24s -> 3901.72s]  malfunction here. This like is going to come down and like rip off all my clothes.
[3913.78s -> 3955.58s]  Reloaded. Last round.
[3993.88s -> 4005.98s]  Got wiggly at the end there. I should be looking behind me. Shoot the sun.
[4007.67s -> 4011.11s]  Am I like stuck in an infinite loop? No, it's like six months. That's my bedtime.
[4032.33s -> 4050.57s]  How much are the wiggles? What the? Oh, it's that guy.
[4056.54s -> 4069.42s]  Wow, there's a guy over there. He was stalling because he was scared.
[4069.42s -> 4080.25s]  You can call it whatever the heck you want. Check this in training. What's that? What's that?
[4080.25s -> 4084.73s]  An intruder onto my right. That kid is going to play calm. I'm dancing to the fucking wiggles.
[4085.45s -> 4093.30s]  They all get different colored shirts on. Bang. That would just hit him right in the
[4093.30s -> 4102.20s]  fucking nose. I would break his nose up into his head. I'll show you again. Bang.
[4103.77s -> 4112.54s]  He'd fucking puke and that would sprint over in fucking one, two, three uppercut.
[4112.78s -> 4129.46s]  What would fucking happen? What a gamer. I gotta get like the hand. I gotta keep the hand down.
[4130.58s -> 4172.14s]  That works too, doesn't it? Beautiful. All right. Not bad. Not terrible. Not good,
[4172.14s -> 4188.86s]  but not bad. But pretty good. I thought he was going to be quicker than that. Slow than that,
[4188.86s -> 4221.11s]  I mean. Come on, man. I had it. Sometimes you just, you see how my hand comes down?
[4250.07s -> 4288.23s]  Come on, do it. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Whoa. You're in the room. What happened? What happened?
[4288.23s -> 4300.86s]  Oh shit. Oh no. Now that's, now that's, that's something bad happened there.
[4322.54s -> 4353.69s]  Well, mom's, mom's seen better days. Come on. Got it. Okay. Oh, pizza. Double pizza.
[4353.69s -> 4376.38s]  See? What a, that's a genius fucking thing. Last meal. All right. Come face me. Anything else
[4376.38s -> 4395.85s]  I should be looking at here? Don't let the TV break. Well, what do you mean don't let the
[4395.85s -> 4408.81s]  TV break? That TV? I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. Ready? Shoot the moon.
[4408.81s -> 4446.25s]  Oh, he's throwing fucking bombs. Fuck. How did I miss? All right. That was just bullshit.
[4446.25s -> 4505.50s]  You saw that. Cock the gun. Cock the gun. Why does it not do it? What do I shoot him? In the
[4505.50s -> 4557.99s]  fucking eyes? My god. Oh my. Oh, it's making me mad. Oh, let me shoot the gun. Look at
[4558.23s -> 4596.49s]  it. Like, no, I want to fight him again. Give me like a fucking shock and then they're like
[4596.49s -> 4638.31s]  screws in it. Seven endings in this game. Stuck forever. I'm you. That was fun. Whoa,
[4638.31s -> 4646.02s]  don't do that to me. That was fucking weird. Uh, what does continue do? Can I start? Could I
[4646.02s -> 4653.48s]  do it again? I'm going to kill this guy. That will make me throw up though. All right.
[4653.48s -> 4658.14s]  Yeah. Let's go. Let's go. Let's do it again. I'm ready. Come face me. Let's go.
[4658.62s -> 4689.66s]  Let's get the good end. Ah, fuck you. Freddy Fazbear asshole. Let's go. All right. Let's
[4689.66s -> 4763.35s]  like do it. Well, that was bullshit. Play with the trombone to reload this shotgun.
[4763.35s -> 4844.36s]  Yay. Just wait a minute. Hold on. That ain't going to be it. Ow. Did I escape the video
[4844.36s -> 4862.26s]  game? Midnight. Is there more? Oh god. Mom's still dead back there. What? I thought I
[4862.26s -> 4873.16s]  would correct it though. Oh my god. He's here. Where is he? Where is this motherfucker?
[4887.82s -> 4908.79s]  Does anybody know where he is? He was right there and like right here. What the fuck?
[4914.49s -> 4945.78s]  Stay in there. We're good. I think I did it. Midnight. Oh, like stomped on the game.
[4948.90s -> 4949.78s]  I called the police.
[4949.78s -> 4971.48s]  Hello? It's my, it's my mom. Why is mom dead? Why would mom be dead here? We're going
[4971.48s -> 4996.25s]  to bury mom? What the fuck? Uh, okay. This is not just a good ending. This is a bad
[4996.33s -> 5023.30s]  ending too. What? Duck season. So is there an ending where mom lives? That was a little
[5023.30s -> 5031.53s]  out of control. It was a fun game though. Nice job, Alex. Nice job, Brandon. Nice job,
[5031.53s -> 5039.06s]  Cameron. Nice job, Kevin. Nice job, Jeremy. Tiffany. Nate. Nate. Chris. Michael. Spencer.
[5039.06s -> 5045.80s]  Spencer again. Two different Spencers in this company. Chapman. Tyler. Heldine. And of course,
[5045.80s -> 5049.80s]  we could forget Jake Watson. He's the one that kept it all together. He's the fucking lawyer.
[5049.80s -> 5067.70s]  Oh, I'm so glad that the Nickelodeon snick couch is behind me. That's, that's only 90s
[5067.70s -> 5078.04s]  boomers will know what that is. Well, there we go. All right. That's cool. That was fun.
[5078.76s -> 5084.39s]  That was a nice little experience. Shooting was fun. Let me come out for a second.
[5084.47s -> 5103.34s]  Oh yeah. Save mom. I, no, I can't. I'm not going to do that. There's five more endings
[5103.98s -> 5110.07s]  and you can get them when you play for the vibe in Oculus Rift. Do a pee break. Yeah,
[5110.07s -> 5112.95s]  I'm going to take a break for a minute. It's going to take a piss and just kind of throw
[5112.95s -> 5118.76s]  some water in my face. And then we come back. I got all this flot. Uh, there is,
[5120.23s -> 5123.27s]  like I could, I could start. I don't think I want to start a mind show yet
[5123.27s -> 5128.41s]  because if I start mine show, then I'm probably not going to get out of that for a while.
[5129.13s -> 5137.82s]  So, uh, there is, I'm not playing that right now. I'll come back. We'll figure it out.
[5137.82s -> 5146.39s]  I have like the Creed boxing game. I've got disassembly VR. I've got a horror game. I've got
[5147.72s -> 5150.44s]  jet Island. I've got another Island. I'm going to, I think it might come back and
[5150.44s -> 5158.54s]  do the dinosaur Island one. We'll find out. I got lots to do. I'll be right back.
[5159.34s -> 5163.34s]  Hold on. Let me just slowly put this down. Okay. See you guys. And did you just hear that like,
[5163.90s -> 5168.63s]  I made like a weird like cat noise at my throat. Uh, I'll be back in like two,
[5168.63s -> 5340.65s]  three minutes. Just going to take a quick little break. All right.
[5342.25s -> 5344.57s]  So I think I'm going to play the dinosaur Island game.
[5345.77s -> 5356.09s]  This is Island three 59. It's a game where you land on an Island and have to fight
[5356.09s -> 5374.26s]  dinosaurs. It's kind of right up my alley. Move this. All right. Uh, dinosaur four 20. No,
[5374.26s -> 5384.62s]  I need to change the game title. I don't think this is Island three. I don't know. This ain't
[5384.62s -> 5395.59s]  even on Twitch directory. No, yes, there it is. All right, let's go. Thank you for your
[5395.59s -> 5424.87s]  patience. Let's open Island three 59. I got to move. All right. We tangled. No, this
[5424.87s -> 5428.63s]  actually is not tangled tonight. I really have to move around too much in the last one. So
[5430.07s -> 5454.57s]  let's go ahead and bring this back. Instruction stand upright. Okay. I got to like do my height.
[5455.77s -> 5462.89s]  Get it out of your system. Now. All right. Get it out of your system. I will allow at least
[5463.53s -> 5475.48s]  25 seconds of height joke spam and then that's it. You got 20 seconds.
[5481.90s -> 5495.40s]  Virtual self. Where is this one? This is lying to me where this control is not over here.
[5495.40s -> 5505.67s]  It's over here. Okay. Stand upright. Make sure a floor height is accurate.
[5506.55s -> 5516.12s]  Okay. Using virtual self. Virtual self is in beta. Step into boots. Step into boots.
[5517.42s -> 5527.42s]  Click create new profile and then use the sliders. I fucked it up again. I'm going to
[5527.42s -> 5536.92s]  put like tape on this shit. So I know. All right. So we can step into the boots.
[5537.56s -> 5558.46s]  Am I in the boots? Does this count? Okay. Arm length. I got to make me shoulders forward
[5558.46s -> 5569.16s]  and back. This looks really strange. No, my chest is kind of like that does not look
[5569.16s -> 5586.09s]  correct. Like an earthworm person. No, that's not, I'm not even on the ground.
[5588.57s -> 5599.78s]  I have to at least be like on the ground. All right. That looks okay.
[5601.08s -> 5613.51s]  Characters. There's different characters. I'm just going to read this guy. Warning
[5613.51s -> 5625.30s]  impacts. Add spectator camera. What the name of God is that? What is that?
[5631.10s -> 5639.93s]  So I can add like my own president evil camera. Can you guys even,
[5640.97s -> 5654.63s]  how do you let anybody see that? Can you guys see this? No, why am I doing that? You're
[5654.63s -> 5667.02s]  in my arm. Yeah, but like that doesn't, this is not going to do anything.
[5678.46s -> 5683.02s]  Use the window capture instead of open VR. Yeah, that's going to run like shit though.
[5683.02s -> 5704.90s]  Now we're going without it. Jesus. Ready to start? You betcha. Let's talk about you
[5705.54s -> 5713.43s]  and your life. He's got a gamer in there.
[5722.81s -> 5729.80s]  Pick up that bucket. Oh, it is like a pew, right?
[5732.76s -> 5745.32s]  Both buckets of face. Oh, just look at the ground. The basics. It was a comfortable
[5745.32s -> 5748.31s]  movement method.
[5760.52s -> 5781.96s]  Oh, I'm going to say teleport track pad. How would you choose how you'd like to aim?
[5784.18s -> 5803.74s]  Look, look, get to the wave. No, go back. Go back. Go back. Did I?
[5805.34s -> 5819.42s]  Hold on. Didn't I turn off? How do I open the menu for this game?
[5820.06s -> 5847.78s]  The in-game menu. Yeah. Sorry guys. Movement mode. Teleport. Okay. Thank you.
[5850.41s -> 5853.53s]  Yo, that's so much easier. I'm not going to die now.
[5868.39s -> 5870.71s]  So press menu to drop on the X.
[5879.74s -> 5883.11s]  Hold the grip. Let's pick a backpack up.
[5892.73s -> 5898.78s]  Okay. All right.
[5905.86s -> 5920.42s]  It's not going to kill us, right? Wait, give him a knife. Yeah.
[5920.98s -> 5937.11s]  What the fuck?
[5941.78s -> 5955.90s]  Climb up the ladder. You got it. There. Wait, what is that? Why is there a secret like
[5955.90s -> 5975.75s]  Alice in Wonderland door? Oh, this is from the helicopter. Reach out and grab a run.
[5975.75s -> 6000.94s]  Oh, that's not even you sprint to enter tower.
[6010.18s -> 6028.47s]  Bucking for you. Lucky for you. Double agent.
[6033.11s -> 6035.67s]  You should be in the clear. I can't shoot the sky.
[6039.94s -> 6044.18s]  That's a good idea. This is the absolute worst way we could be having this conversation.
[6045.48s -> 6056.57s]  Oh, the kids, the kids doing good. All right. It doesn't, it's fine. It doesn't work.
[6063.64s -> 6077.11s]  Aim movement at ladder to exit. All right. Fall like a nose.
[6080.23s -> 6086.81s]  Restricted area warning. All right. We're looking for what? We're looking for dinosaurs.
[6087.69s -> 6129.93s]  I didn't mean to do that. Get to the thing. What? One, two, three. All right. Oh, you're too close.
[6131.53s -> 6139.22s]  What's in here? Oh, more of this.
[6144.70s -> 6147.66s]  Hold down grip with gun hand until ammo selector appears.
[6160.41s -> 6170.65s]  All right. That's odd, but fine. Thanks a lot. I don't know what this guy's name is.
[6172.63s -> 6211.24s]  Kill the raptors. When did they attack? Thank you. That was kind of lame. It's all right though.
[6224.55s -> 6234.65s]  All right. You got a leopardette. Pills? What is this leopardette?
[6240.47s -> 6243.51s]  That was scary. I thought that was a tree.
[6243.51s -> 6269.10s]  I thought it was a tree and it started moving. Grab everything. That's cool. Up into the house.
[6275.83s -> 6306.66s]  What kind of door? It's a push door. Really? Move upgrade to highlighted area on guns. Laser
[6306.66s -> 6323.19s]  sight. What was that? How do I get to the gate? Can I sneak out this way? Yep. Come on. I
[6323.19s -> 6347.98s]  can't do that. Shit. Where? Kill the stegosaur. Where's there a stegosaur?
[6364.44s -> 6387.53s]  Where? Okay. I want to see a clip of that. I want to see how stupid I actually am. There's
[6387.53s -> 6415.94s]  no stegosaur. I'm a fucking idiot. I could hear him, but he wasn't on the screen.
[6416.50s -> 6443.16s]  All right. T-Rex is going to show up right here. All right. Let's go. Island 359.
[6444.04s -> 6455.27s]  So what do you do? What are you supposed to do in this game? Update 1.0. Survival mode exists now.
[6455.27s -> 6463.53s]  What is over here? Mercenary store. Cash in merc credits for gear. Sell found gear for credits.
[6467.94s -> 6478.44s]  Okay. That's pretty cool. Let me get this shit on. All right. See you later. Good luck.
[6482.82s -> 6488.09s]  Survival mode? Which one? What do you want me to do? Sell your knife and gum.
[6493.82s -> 6499.26s]  Survival. A carefully paced survival experience. Traverse the open island.
[6499.26s -> 6504.30s]  Discover survivor stories. Explore camp, scrounge, loot, kill, and survive. Okay.
[6505.42s -> 6520.82s]  I'll give it a try. I'm going to throw up for this. Do I get a different gun? Same gun?
[6530.95s -> 6541.58s]  Yeah. Yeah. Give me that. I'm not doing that again. I'm going to wear the bucket. I just
[6541.58s -> 6559.08s]  want to land. Oh, that kind of hurts. That's a great feature. I don't even know what I'm looking
[6559.08s -> 6573.51s]  at. Am I crazy? Does that look strange? My hand is fucked up. That's all right.
[6574.31s -> 6582.62s]  I feel like I'm looking at the world through some strange filter.
[6583.34s -> 6586.49s]  What do I have to do? Eat berries or something? Eat weeds?
[6589.10s -> 6598.55s]  All right. I hear something. I don't have any bullets in this guy. Get out of here.
[6618.02s -> 6627.91s]  Stick it back on like a kebab. Is there an alarm on you? What the? Oh, this is on my hunger meter?
[6628.71s -> 6643.50s]  Okay. I'm just going to find the bed. That's just a JPEG. That's not going to do anything
[6643.50s -> 6652.28s]  for me. What about over here? Up in the top? No, there's a building right here.
[6653.08s -> 6667.05s]  There we go. Health. What about food? Do I need anything? What's this? Potato chips?
[6670.94s -> 6685.59s]  Okay. No. Give me the knife back. There's something in here. There's a crate here.
[6689.83s -> 6692.52s]  I don't think I can do anything with it. Can I not do something with this?
[6693.16s -> 6709.37s]  This is like a weapon crate. Should I go in the outhouse? This is just an open world.
[6709.93s -> 6732.94s]  Let's climb up. Pretty good vantage point though. A crowbar? I don't think I can pick
[6732.94s -> 6748.66s]  that up. Yeah, I can. Nice. I'm bashing. Somebody's heading with this thing. Okay.
[6750.73s -> 6758.81s]  Check the yellow one. This is not a rhinoceros. What are those things? Triceratops.
[6760.78s -> 6784.60s]  Are Triceratops friendly? Will he run after me? I don't even know where he is.
[6785.96s -> 6797.03s]  Oh my God. He's freaking out. He's like a dog with the zoomies. He's a dog that just had a
[6797.03s -> 6824.66s]  bath. What is it? Shit. That was so mean. Did he tire himself out? He killed that dog. I
[6824.66s -> 6872.36s]  didn't kill anything. Come here you motherfucker. Oh, he hit me. He's hitting me. All right. I
[6872.36s -> 6883.11s]  have to get out of this. I'm gonna die. Have fun. Goodbye. I'm getting killed over this.
[6883.11s -> 6901.11s]  I'm already like dead. He's just stuck down there in that ditch. He's still there? That's
[6901.11s -> 6904.55s]  so terrifying that they move so erratically like that. If you come across a huge...
[6906.62s -> 6915.54s]  Where was it? Where did I want to go? Is that him? I'm just gonna go this way.
[6927.08s -> 6947.66s]  How do I eat? Oh shit. I'm almost dead. What's up there? Okay. Fizz. I don't know
[6947.66s -> 6955.14s]  what that thing is. Do I have to eat the dinosaurs? Is that how this works?
[6956.57s -> 6961.14s]  He's not threatening, right? They're not that threatening. That's one of the
[6961.14s -> 6978.10s]  velociraptors. That's like some of the weird dinosaur. It looks kind of mean though. I'm
[6978.10s -> 7005.19s]  not gonna fuck with that. It's an elephant. It's an elephant. Run. Why is it an elephant?
[7006.23s -> 7025.34s]  Run away. Oh, that's unbelievable. Is that what that dinosaur actually sounded like?
[7026.14s -> 7048.01s]  Get out of here. Hey, you want something? Here. I think I ate it. He's running again.
[7054.84s -> 7072.78s]  I don't know. He's still chasing me with his tuba. Oh, come on. Why is he still here?
[7073.74s -> 7089.02s]  I don't know how to get away from him. I got dirt in the head. I was so called for.
[7091.93s -> 7109.78s]  I just spit on myself. He's still chasing me. Why? Aren't you out of breath at this point?
[7112.18s -> 7123.82s]  He's gonna kill over and die from exhaustion. There's a car. Can I get in the car?
[7128.42s -> 7130.90s]  Get on top of the car. All right. I'm on top of the car. He can't get me.
[7149.94s -> 7155.50s]  You bastard. Get away from me. Leave. Leave me alone.
[7155.50s -> 7171.64s]  This is the stupidest thing. He followed me for like 12 blocks.
[7183.70s -> 7189.54s]  That was too much. I swear to God, if I get off this and he's right there,
[7189.54s -> 7195.86s]  I'm gonna fucking pee my pants. Okay. Are we good? I'm gonna open this door.
[7203.18s -> 7204.70s]  How do I open this?
[7204.70s -> 7223.43s]  There's nothing even in here. There's just mold. I can't get over that. That was stupid.
[7224.07s -> 7232.92s]  Okay. Let's keep going. I need to... I'm gonna die. The whole world is red right now because
[7232.92s -> 7261.43s]  I'm one head away from death. Oh shit. Does he have a camera? He's videotaping like a
[7261.43s -> 7268.17s]  skateboard video. Look at that. Watch. A fucking velociraptor is gonna do like an
[7268.17s -> 7287.90s]  ollie right here and go over him. I think he's too far away. Yeah. He's recovering.
[7287.90s -> 7304.74s]  He's thinking about what he did. Is that like a base I can ransack or something?
[7316.76s -> 7320.36s]  I don't like how open this looks. This is a big open field. I don't like it at all.
[7321.08s -> 7329.70s]  I also don't like what's going on here on the skyline. It hurts my head.
[7330.50s -> 7350.92s]  Am I at the edge of the world? I'm so lost.
[7357.10s -> 7358.62s]  Is it that? I would have...
[7369.11s -> 7375.96s]  There's something right here. What is it? It's a stegosaurus.
[7379.98s -> 7397.26s]  Don't like run around in a circle like a dog. I can't get on top of this rock, can I?
[7397.26s -> 7414.78s]  Okay. I'm on the rock. I think I'm safe. Base. How do I get by you to get down there?
[7414.78s -> 7429.48s]  Wrap all the way around. He's just waiting for me to move. He's just got his eyes on me.
[7430.12s -> 7434.84s]  I didn't know stegosaurus was that fast. I thought they were slow lumbering animals.
[7448.14s -> 7461.78s]  Okay, we're good. Ammo. Give me something. The base is right down here.
[7461.78s -> 7469.08s]  There's air conditioning here. That's electricity.
[7475.83s -> 7495.13s]  What is that? Punch it? It's not gonna work. Is there like a front door? Here it is.
[7495.13s -> 7507.45s]  How do I open this? There's a big on button. That would work, wouldn't it?
[7508.09s -> 7522.73s]  Eureka! Give me something to eat or scavenge or something. I got AC over here.
[7523.37s -> 7537.08s]  Let's go in the building. Find story note to unlock. What is this? Slenderman?
[7537.88s -> 7557.99s]  Let me find story note. Bullets know nothing? Oh god damn it. Come on. What? Tent? It's getting
[7557.99s -> 7565.10s]  dark out. I can't even go in this tent. Anything in the dumpster?
[7586.09s -> 7590.81s]  Uh, okay. I'm supposed to be picking up sticks. I gotta get another note.
[7591.85s -> 7605.21s]  It's getting too dark. Resident sleeper. Crafting game. Look, let me just...
[7612.06s -> 7623.83s]  Next game. Hold on. Give me one second. It showed its true nature. It's a crafting game.
[7630.81s -> 7648.06s]  Huh, okay. Just play mercenary mode. That's true. We should probably... Wow, that's
[7648.06s -> 7655.35s]  main menu. Let's do mercenary mode. Let's see how it is. That's like putting sticks
[7655.35s -> 7671.29s]  together and making fires. I don't wanna do that. Mercenary mode. Move freely,
[7671.29s -> 7677.21s]  explore, hunt, kill, or be killed. We'll go to the beach. Loot drop. Big hunt. Loot drops.
[7677.21s -> 7689.64s]  Big hunt. Big hunt. Difficulty normal. Let's go. We'll move on after this.
[7692.78s -> 7709.53s]  I'm not even gonna give it a second. Wait, wait. No, no. No, no. Give me that.
[7709.61s -> 7733.34s]  Ah, come on. What was that? What was that? Go to the waypoint. Okay.
[7739.03s -> 7756.26s]  How do I give it a gun? Can't grab arrow with gun. Well, how do I let go of this? Okay,
[7756.26s -> 7764.71s]  arrows. Where are the arrows? Where are the arrows? What the fuck is this?
[7768.62s -> 7786.82s]  What is that? What is this? Where are the arrows? It says can't grab arrows with gun. Why not?
[7802.58s -> 7831.86s]  Oh, no. I want the backpack. I want the backpack. That's pretty fucking sick. All right,
[7831.86s -> 7850.07s]  let's go. I think I have infinity of these. Let's go. I don't put the knife away. All right,
[7850.07s -> 7929.16s]  hide. Wait, we point right in the neck, right? Wait! One more time. One more time.
[7929.16s -> 7947.42s]  One more time. Okay, let's go. No, I don't want that. Let's just, I'm gonna kill this thing.
[7948.86s -> 7957.64s]  I don't even need, I don't give a shit about anything else. Let's go. I'd like some radio
[7957.64s -> 8012.97s]  metal. What? Jesus Christ. Please just let me do it. Ah! Okay, moving on. This game's
[8012.97s -> 8021.10s]  actually pretty cool. This game's pretty cool. It is. It's a pretty cool game. I'll tell you.
[8024.01s -> 8036.18s]  All right, next up is Apollo Creed, the boxing game. This game makes me angry. Wait, why?
[8037.22s -> 8062.79s]  How the fuck did I end up over here? Give me one sec. I'm the bad guy. You look sad.
[8064.47s -> 8081.30s]  Sad? All right, you want to do horror? I do have a horror game. All right, we'll try this
[8081.30s -> 8100.10s]  horror game that I got. Let me close out of this. All right, how do I get out of this? Quick. Okay.
[8103.82s -> 8109.26s]  The game I have is called Dreadhalls. It looked like people thought it was fun. It looked like
[8109.26s -> 8130.10s]  it was pretty highly rated. Let's give it a try. Yeah, Dreadhalls. Not that one. What's
[8130.10s -> 8148.30s]  wrong with that one? Okay, launch Dreadhalls in Steam VR mode. That's the one I want to do.
[8148.30s -> 8169.42s]  All right, let's just do it. All right, I need to change the game to Dreadhalls.
[8169.42s -> 8189.43s]  Is this game going to actually cause me a problem? Well, as long as I don't throw up, I don't care.
[8190.98s -> 8200.74s]  And turn the lights off. Why does that matter? Turn the lights off? I'm in here. Why do I
[8200.74s -> 8221.43s]  need to turn the lights off? Turn the lights off. Hold on. Why would you want me to do this?
[8222.31s -> 8235.77s]  I can't even, why can I not control my lights? I'm not connected? Unable to connect
[8237.69s -> 8259.74s]  to my Phillips Hue? Why? There we go. Is that better? All right, see you guys on there.
[8262.14s -> 8269.85s]  By the way, if you want to know the plan on Saturday, I'm pretty sure me and Star are
[8269.85s -> 8280.90s]  going to do some co-op VR games. So that should be a lot of fun. We're going to try
[8280.90s -> 8293.78s]  like Wreck Room, a couple of the multiplayer games, see how they are. Ow, my hair. I got
[8293.78s -> 8300.02s]  to prepare for this. I hate this shit. God damn, like horror games and I got to put both headphones
[8300.02s -> 8323.08s]  in. Hey, get ready for some fake reactions. Yeah, that's right. It's tuber time. Let me
[8323.08s -> 8338.71s]  give you a good thumbnail first though. Let me get you a good thumbnail. Is that good? Both
[8338.71s -> 8351.54s]  these have to go in. God damn it. I'm doing both. I'm doing both. It's a horror game. I'm
[8351.54s -> 8372.42s]  going to do both. All right. Here we go. Just don't ever have hair. Just get rid of it.
[8373.24s -> 8380.46s]  It just gets in the way. It's just dead. Why even have it? It's just fingernails. You
[8380.46s -> 8384.92s]  know that your hair is just your fingernails, but finer. We cut our fingernails. Just get
[8384.92s -> 8391.80s]  rid of them. We're going to evil off our fingernails off anyways. All right. I'm ready.
[8393.29s -> 8401.70s]  No, I'm not. I am. Okay. That was, I was just puked. I was just like refluxed.
[8402.34s -> 8419.00s]  Fucking stalling. I know I'm stalling. All right. Options. Audio setting. Five hands.
[8419.00s -> 8431.80s]  Right-handed. Keep the tutorial on. How are we doing on audio? We good? How's that?
[8432.68s -> 8439.51s]  Pretty good. Video settings should be fine. Quality good. Anti-aliasing. That's whatever.
[8440.47s -> 8446.87s]  Moving settings. Rotation speed. Snap comfort. Move in looking direction. Press trackpad to
[8446.87s -> 8457.96s]  move. I think that's fine. Well, here you go, motherfuckers. This is what you wanted.
[8459.32s -> 8462.92s]  Content warning. This game is an intense horror experience featuring scenes of disturbing
[8462.92s -> 8477.86s]  nature. Player discretion is advised. Inventory move light. Interactive open sprint map look.
[8478.10s -> 8485.30s]  So I move around with this. I look with this. That's inventory. This is map. Interactive light
[8485.30s -> 8507.58s]  and sprint. Point with your right hand and press trigger to pick up. A bottle of oil.
[8507.58s -> 8516.10s]  You can use it to fuel your lamp. Right trigger to collect. Oh, I have a lamp. This
[8516.10s -> 8531.14s]  is just VR amnesia. You actually have to walk around. What the fuck is this thing?
[8531.14s -> 8536.79s]  What the fuck is this thing? Handwritten note. I can't wait for you. Not anymore. Not here.
[8536.79s -> 8542.71s]  There's an exit. The stone face told me. I'll be there. I'll wait for you there.
[8542.71s -> 8553.80s]  Follow my trail. Find the eyes. Find the exit. Hold right hand. Trigger and turn hand
[8553.80s -> 8605.38s]  left and right. Okay. So does that drive a weapon? Two coins? You can always brute force
[8605.38s -> 8609.46s]  locks. But using these lock picks should be faster. Right trigger to collect them.
[8609.46s -> 8613.45s]  What about these coins? A coin from the past. Right trigger to collect it.
[8614.57s -> 8636.60s]  What do you do with the coins though? Haunted house games.
[8651.85s -> 8663.90s]  Try to close this behind me. Close. Get this thing closed. How can I tell
[8663.90s -> 8668.46s]  how much oil is in the tank here? Use the oil in your inventory to fuel your lamp.
[8669.26s -> 8678.82s]  So that's the inventory. What the hell was that noise? Grab the lamp oil.
[8678.82s -> 8696.14s]  Okay. That makes it brighter. I have a couple more lock picks. When do I get machete?
[8696.14s -> 8723.94s]  Open the inventory and grab a lock pick. Place the lock pick here and then release.
[8723.94s -> 8735.19s]  So it opens it instantly. Coins. No! That was important information. How do I look at that
[8735.19s -> 8738.55s]  again? Where's that? How do I look at that again? That was probably like how to stop the
[8738.55s -> 8757.30s]  monster. No, that was just like geolocation. Is this like a dress? Oh. Cheeto location.
[8758.02s -> 8807.13s]  I need to be able to hear shit. Sir! Straight through here. Oh my god. Should I turn around
[8807.13s -> 8854.46s]  and run the other way? Looks like a receptacle or something. Hear this! What do I do? I hear
[8854.54s -> 8857.74s]  something moving over here behind me. I need to fill this up with oil.
[8868.14s -> 8874.06s]  I didn't change the game. Away from Dino D-Day. Whatever it's called. What's it called? Island
[8874.06s -> 8879.66s]  Dino? Is there a mod with power? Can you change it? No, I did change it. I'm just
[8879.66s -> 8921.91s]  panicking right now. Give me this. Give me these. Give me those. Give me this.
[8928.47s -> 8937.94s]  Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! What is this? What is this? What is that for?
[8938.74s -> 8956.70s]  A human eye. Find the eyes. Oh no, that's gonna activate her. I just activated her.
[8956.70s -> 8978.71s]  I just activated her! All right, I'm gonna have to- I'm gonna- I'm going with the
[8978.71s -> 8989.11s]  Burger Boy technique. You ready? Burger Boy technique. What would Burger Boy do? He would
[8989.11s -> 9017.14s]  do this. All right, I'm ready to breath from here. All right, I can go that way. One of
[9017.14s -> 9032.12s]  these is gonna open. That's the good witch of the west, right? The good witch of the east.
[9035.14s -> 9049.24s]  That did it. It must be another eye. The snake?
[9084.71s -> 9093.98s]  Where is that person coming from? Where is that person coming from? There's a room
[9094.62s -> 9114.01s]  to the left. Monoculars. Walking along the corridor, I can hear my footsteps,
[9114.01s -> 9118.87s]  my breathing, but also something else. A scraping sound coming from the darkness behind me.
[9119.51s -> 9122.87s]  It ceased when I stopped to look around me, but now I can hear it again.
[9123.99s -> 9129.83s]  Is that supposed to be a tutorial? That's a tutorial, right? What tutorial does that mean?
[9129.83s -> 9141.32s]  Just don't look behind me. I wanna make something very clear here. I am bumping into
[9141.32s -> 9154.92s]  something right here. I cannot go back. I'm bumping into an object. She's literally right on me.
[9154.92s -> 9160.44s]  I'm bumping into her back. I'm in like a fucking line at Disney World bumping into her.
[9161.08s -> 9200.62s]  She's right there. You can go ahead and just stay in there if you'd like.
[9200.62s -> 9205.70s]  I'm trying to close the door. Just stay in there. You don't have to worry about me.
[9208.34s -> 9223.62s]  I'm just gonna walk. I have an itchy eyeball.
[9228.22s -> 9233.16s]  She's gonna be behind me and she's just gonna jump in and scare me.
[9235.38s -> 9262.52s]  It's a big room. I'm like a shuffling old man.
[9295.74s -> 9332.46s]  She's right fucking there. I'm not looking. She might be in one of the... I got an itchy
[9332.46s -> 9350.23s]  ass. Hold on. Is this thing gonna stand up? Why did I wake up alone and I have no answer?
[9350.23s -> 9353.59s]  My head still hurts so perhaps I stayed unconscious for too long but
[9353.59s -> 9356.31s]  they wouldn't have waited for me. That is unless they couldn't stay here.
[9357.03s -> 9370.20s]  Oh fuck off lady. That's fine. I'll just stay over here. Can I see like a shadow behind me?
[9370.20s -> 9404.09s]  I can't. I can't move. Can I? Be gone!
[9410.12s -> 9413.48s]  Ah shit. Okay. What's the... Okay. You can go down here.
[9449.18s -> 9456.73s]  What? This creature moves when you look away. Don't turn your back to it. I thought I was
[9456.73s -> 9467.62s]  supposed to like put my back towards the creature. What? So the thing was just glued to me the whole
[9467.62s -> 9480.73s]  time? So I have to stare at that lady. I'm sitting there like backing up. She's just like
[9480.73s -> 9495.56s]  dancing behind me. Oh man that was... Oh god. There's more than one. Oh that's unbelievable.
[9495.56s -> 9503.29s]  The whole thing is computer generated right? The whole thing is just computer generated.
[9503.29s -> 9516.26s]  Alright where are you guys? I want to make sure I'm in the right spot. God damn it.
[9518.84s -> 9531.38s]  So I did find the other eyes. I was done. God. Alright let's go. I knew she was in the room too.
[9532.34s -> 9541.40s]  Oh I hurt my whole body. There's got to be another eye. Alright I gotta stare right at the lady.
[9544.23s -> 9549.46s]  I hate that mechanic. I hate this mechanic. I don't like this mechanic.
[9550.10s -> 9558.60s]  Okay stare at her. Right stare right at her face. Come here lady. I don't want any trouble
[9558.60s -> 9600.02s]  with you. Where the fuck is she? It's just pillows. Oh dude no no no. Humans weren't supposed to be
[9600.02s -> 9618.46s]  doing this shit. Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Hello? Yep you're over here
[9618.46s -> 9648.84s]  somewhere. Humans weren't supposed to be doing this. I looked at you. I'm looking at you right
[9648.84s -> 9661.11s]  now. I'm looking at you right now. Food just came up out of my mouth. Like old food.
[9661.11s -> 9691.59s]  I just like puked. I just tasted tobacco. How? Was I eating cigarettes in my sleep?
[9691.59s -> 9708.54s]  It's not that even back here. I gotta go down that hall.
[9708.54s -> 9718.15s]  Oh shit. In my pants. I think she's behind me. I gotta look at her. Hey hey hey hey hey hey
[9718.15s -> 9729.08s]  Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey there! Hey there! Hey boy! Hey! Hi!
[9729.08s -> 9733.85s]  Don't you dare get out of that! You! That hurt you!
[9733.85s -> 9741.52s]  I'm looking at you! I'm looking at you! I'm looking at you! Huh?
[9741.52s -> 9758.42s]  This is wrong monster. You shouldn't have looked at her.
[9758.42s -> 9777.66s]  Don't look at the lady. Look at the other one. I thought they were both ladies.
[9777.66s -> 9783.54s]  I don't do well in this environment, man. I got both the headphones in.
[9785.98s -> 9810.35s]  I'm fucking... I'm eating cigarettes in my sleep.
[9810.35s -> 9821.69s]  Alright, I'm gonna just do it. It's like sweat all over my mouth.
[9821.69s -> 9826.32s]  Are you gonna give me a weapon?
[9826.32s -> 9829.14s]  Come on, am I getting Luigi?
[9829.14s -> 9833.82s]  Sid, he was the one who told me about the god and this place.
[9833.82s -> 9836.42s]  He didn't want to come, not at first, but I convinced him.
[9836.42s -> 9841.22s]  I wanted to see it. I needed to.
[9841.22s -> 9844.17s]  Points.
[9845.66s -> 9854.78s]  I'm thinking how big this map is.
[9854.78s -> 9860.15s]  Ugh. So this... Don't look at lady.
[9860.15s -> 9864.39s]  Look at the... the smoke monster?
[9864.39s -> 9874.74s]  So, the cloud of dust. Look at the dust cloud. Don't look at lady.
[9874.74s -> 9879.81s]  Is there any other monsters that I need to have tutorials on?
[9879.81s -> 9883.43s]  But they both look like they could be made out of the dust.
[9883.43s -> 9891.41s]  Ugh. Standing around and...
[9891.41s -> 9894.41s]  Okay, is that the duster or is that her? It's a duster.
[9894.41s -> 9912.05s]  Magic staff. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it do?
[9921.63s -> 9942.46s]  Take me. I have no idea what that does.
[9946.87s -> 9953.12s]  I feel like this is important.
[9953.12s -> 9974.93s]  Should I do something with that?
[9974.93s -> 9979.15s]  What is the point?
[9979.15s -> 10003.83s]  Alright, bye. Is this a safe room? Can I come back here and...
[10003.83s -> 10005.83s]  I have no clothes.
[10011.49s -> 10022.26s]  Don't look at lady. Look at the dust cloud.
[10022.26s -> 10024.26s]  And do I have to run from lady?
[10024.26s -> 10043.78s]  The hallways connect and it just causes me so much fucking stress.
[10043.78s -> 10047.87s]  Is it? I don't know. Is that it? I don't know what that is.
[10047.87s -> 10049.87s]  I don't know what that is. Someone's crawling.
[10049.87s -> 10055.94s]  I don't know what that is.
[10055.94s -> 10058.94s]  Somebody's like crawling on the ceiling?
[10058.94s -> 10060.94s]  Somebody crawling on the ceiling? I don't know.
[10060.94s -> 10069.24s]  This is horrible.
[10069.24s -> 10074.81s]  Ugh. Damn it.
[10074.81s -> 10077.18s]  God damn it. I don't know what I'm doing.
[10077.18s -> 10079.18s]  God damn it. It's lady. Don't look at the lady.
[10079.18s -> 10081.85s]  God damn it.
[10081.85s -> 10084.22s]  God damn it.
[10084.22s -> 10087.42s]  God damn it.
[10087.42s -> 10090.42s]  God damn it.
[10090.42s -> 10093.11s]  God! Is that a boss? Is that a guy? Is that a boss?
[10093.11s -> 10095.11s]  Is it a boss?
[10095.11s -> 10097.11s]  Is it a skeleton or a boss?
[10097.11s -> 10099.35s]  I don't know. I don't know.
[10099.35s -> 10101.35s]  No, I'm not. I gotta move. Where am I gonna go?
[10101.35s -> 10103.35s]  Is it a dust cloud? Is it a dust cloud behind me?
[10103.35s -> 10107.13s]  This is unbearable.
[10107.13s -> 10109.82s]  Holy shit. Come on, give me the eye.
[10109.82s -> 10111.82s]  No, another dead end.
[10111.82s -> 10116.55s]  Shit.
[10116.55s -> 10119.62s]  Is that the lady or is that the...
[10119.62s -> 10121.62s]  It's a smoke man.
[10121.62s -> 10124.31s]  That's a smoke guy, right?
[10124.31s -> 10130.63s]  Stare at the smoke.
[10130.63s -> 10132.63s]  Down, down, down, down, down, down,
[10132.63s -> 10134.63s]  out, out, out, out, out.
[10134.63s -> 10144.86s]  Okay. Do you go away?
[10144.86s -> 10152.07s]  Mission accomplished.
[10152.07s -> 10160.97s]  No, how dare you come out now.
[10160.97s -> 10162.97s]  How dare you come out now.
[10166.49s -> 10176.22s]  Is that a person? I don't know.
[10176.22s -> 10181.72s]  Wait a minute. Is that a thing? What is that thing?
[10181.72s -> 10187.29s]  Yeah, yeah.
[10187.29s -> 10189.53s]  I was never scared of small places
[10189.53s -> 10191.53s]  but the walls of these narrow corridors seem to be
[10191.53s -> 10193.53s]  suffering from a lot of attempts to feel like I can't breathe. Yeah, fine.
[10193.53s -> 10199.54s]  Oh, fuck.
[10199.54s -> 10207.35s]  I don't know if it's the lady or if it's the smoke.
[10207.35s -> 10214.14s]  It's not the smoke.
[10214.14s -> 10216.14s]  It's not the smoke. It's smoke, I think, right?
[10216.14s -> 10218.14s]  It's not smoke. It's not smoke.
[10218.14s -> 10220.14s]  It's not smoke. It's not smoke.
[10220.14s -> 10233.94s]  It's smoke!
[10233.94s -> 10239.90s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[10239.90s -> 10243.48s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[10243.48s -> 10251.35s]  Okay, straight ahead.
[10251.35s -> 10253.35s]  I don't care about shit about money.
[10253.35s -> 10255.35s]  I don't care about money.
[10255.35s -> 10257.35s]  Can I turn that? Can I please pull this?
[10257.35s -> 10259.35s]  Sir?
[10259.35s -> 10261.35s]  I hear him again.
[10261.35s -> 10263.91s]  Don't you dare.
[10263.91s -> 10269.86s]  Get down. Back to hell.
[10269.86s -> 10283.18s]  Why can I not pull that?
[10283.18s -> 10289.77s]  I have to go to the doctor after this.
[10289.77s -> 10291.77s]  So why can I not pull this?
[10291.77s -> 10306.02s]  Where is this damn thing?
[10306.02s -> 10308.02s]  Left and then down this hole.
[10308.02s -> 10316.22s]  Okay, here's what I need you guys to do for me.
[10316.22s -> 10318.22s]  I need you guys to scream in the chat
[10318.22s -> 10320.22s]  Is that lady or smoke? My brain, I can't do it.
[10320.22s -> 10329.37s]  You understand?
[10329.37s -> 10332.25s]  Is that lady or smoke? Which one is it?
[10332.25s -> 10335.32s]  Is that lady or smoke?
[10335.32s -> 10339.80s]  Which one is that one?
[10339.80s -> 10347.35s]  Lady?
[10347.35s -> 10350.81s]  Is it smoke?
[10350.81s -> 10353.88s]  I hear something.
[10353.88s -> 10355.88s]  Is it smoke?
[10355.88s -> 10360.87s]  I'm fucking panicking right now.
[10360.87s -> 10365.99s]  This is so bad.
[10365.99s -> 10373.74s]  I don't know.
[10373.74s -> 10376.62s]  Don't listen to chat.
[10376.62s -> 10380.71s]  Sweat is fogging up these mirrors.
[10380.71s -> 10399.46s]  Almost there.
[10399.46s -> 10401.46s]  Almost there.
[10401.46s -> 10414.46s]  I'm there.
[10414.46s -> 10428.60s]  Hey!
[10428.60s -> 10430.60s]  It's a smoke person. I think it's a smoke person.
[10430.60s -> 10434.38s]  I'm not cut out for these games.
[10434.38s -> 10443.26s]  There it is.
[10443.26s -> 10445.26s]  I tapped something. What did I tap?
[10445.26s -> 10448.90s]  What happened?
[10448.90s -> 10450.90s]  Is this what I wanted when I decided to come here?
[10450.90s -> 10453.27s]  This is a horrible place. I always knew what it would be.
[10453.27s -> 10456.34s]  Why am I here?
[10456.34s -> 10461.19s]  An exit.
[10461.19s -> 10472.52s]  Am I out? Is this wind?
[10472.52s -> 10474.52s]  I missed oil. It's alright.
[10474.52s -> 10478.17s]  I've been missing some fucking brain cells after this one.
[10478.17s -> 10480.17s]  I've been missing some fucking brain cells after this one.
[10480.17s -> 10483.50s]  I'm too neurotic of a person to play these games.
[10483.50s -> 10485.50s]  I'm too neurotic of a person to play these games.
[10485.50s -> 10487.50s]  This is too more to do.
[10487.50s -> 10500.34s]  This is too more to do.
[10500.34s -> 10502.34s]  I think I'm just gonna go, like I said before,
[10502.34s -> 10504.34s]  with the original tactic
[10504.34s -> 10506.34s]  of just run as fast as I can to the exit.
[10506.34s -> 10508.34s]  of just run as fast as I can to the exit.
[10508.34s -> 10512.57s]  I feel like that's gonna be a good idea.
[10512.57s -> 10522.02s]  Good luck.
[10522.02s -> 10524.02s]  My back hurts right now.
[10524.02s -> 10526.02s]  This is just like tense.
[10526.02s -> 10529.61s]  I'm gonna have to go get like a massage.
[10529.61s -> 10531.61s]  Oh, you have a lot of tension.
[10531.61s -> 10533.61s]  Wow, is this from work?
[10533.61s -> 10535.78s]  Uh, I mean, maybe.
[10535.78s -> 10537.78s]  Oh, wow.
[10537.78s -> 10539.78s]  Do you like construction?
[10539.78s -> 10541.78s]  Do you sit down for a long time?
[10541.78s -> 10543.78s]  I was playing a VR game on Twitch.
[10543.78s -> 10545.78s]  I was playing a horror game.
[10545.78s -> 10547.78s]  I was playing a horror game.
[10547.78s -> 10550.09s]  Oh, yeah, that's what I did for work.
[10550.09s -> 10553.61s]  That's fucking kind of weird, but okay.
[10553.61s -> 10557.32s]  That's fucking kind of weird, but okay.
[10557.32s -> 10559.32s]  Do a narrow-toed run into the entrance. Sure.
[10559.32s -> 10587.34s]  No, it's the other thing. Hold on.
[10587.34s -> 10600.57s]  There you go. It's time to go.
[10600.57s -> 10602.57s]  I'm not gonna waste any time. Get it open.
[10602.57s -> 10639.43s]  Go.
[10639.43s -> 10643.83s]  Fuck you! Fuck you!
[10643.83s -> 10669.43s]  It's a lady. It's a lady.
[10669.43s -> 10672.44s]  I need to not look at the lady. Look at the statue.
[10672.44s -> 10674.44s]  I need to look at the statue. Don't tell me
[10674.44s -> 10676.44s]  to look at the statue that's right here.
[10676.44s -> 10678.44s]  The statue... Oh, would you look at the
[10678.44s -> 10680.44s]  statue that's right there. You know,
[10680.44s -> 10682.44s]  the fucking monster that's gonna jump
[10682.44s -> 10684.44s]  in your face because you looked at the statue.
[10684.44s -> 10717.98s]  Oh, man, that thing.
[10717.98s -> 10720.98s]  He got off the pedestal, right?
[10720.98s -> 10726.49s]  That's what this is.
[10738.52s -> 10742.36s]  Punch it.
[10742.36s -> 10745.11s]  Who's doing that one?
[10745.11s -> 10747.11s]  Am I gonna get crowded by monsters?
[10747.11s -> 10749.11s]  I have to move. I gotta move.
[10749.11s -> 10751.11s]  But I don't know what that means. If I turn around, is he gonna follow me?
[10751.11s -> 10753.11s]  I don't know.
[10753.11s -> 10755.11s]  I don't understand. If I leave this room, is he gonna follow me behind me?
[10755.11s -> 10757.11s]  I don't know what to do here.
[10757.11s -> 10759.11s]  I'm so fucking... I don't know.
[10759.11s -> 10784.58s]  The door's open here.
[10784.58s -> 10791.82s]  Okay, I'm gonna say left.
[10791.82s -> 10795.85s]  Okay, fuck you. Bye.
[10795.85s -> 10803.59s]  Don't look at the lady. Look at the smoke
[10803.59s -> 10807.30s]  and look at the statue guy. Is he behind me?
[10807.30s -> 10809.30s]  Fucking crawling.
[10809.30s -> 10812.76s]  Oh, God.
[10814.76s -> 10816.76s]  Go, go, go, go. Out, out, out, out.
[10816.76s -> 10819.77s]  Oil, oil, oil, oil in the can.
[10819.77s -> 10824.70s]  Go, go, go.
[10824.70s -> 10826.70s]  Oh, you bitch. No.
[10826.70s -> 10831.43s]  It's the same room?
[10831.43s -> 10851.38s]  Oh!
[10851.38s -> 10854.58s]  Only one more and I get a prize.
[10854.58s -> 10863.93s]  Um, what the hell is that?
[10865.93s -> 10882.18s]  This is it. One more.
[10882.18s -> 10892.30s]  This game's crazy. Look in that door.
[10892.30s -> 10900.04s]  What?
[10900.04s -> 10906.82s]  I've already been down there. Don't, don't.
[10906.82s -> 10908.82s]  Your fly is down. I don't have a fly right now.
[10908.82s -> 10911.64s]  I'm wearing workout pants.
[10911.64s -> 10913.64s]  Alright, let's go.
[10913.64s -> 10929.26s]  Am I getting a shield?
[10929.26s -> 10933.80s]  Do I get to have a shield?
[10933.80s -> 10941.61s]  That's a huge shield.
[10941.61s -> 10943.61s]  So let me just clarify this one more time.
[10943.61s -> 10947.88s]  The statue,
[10947.88s -> 10949.88s]  I've got to look at that statue. You guys are not just fucking with me.
[10949.88s -> 10951.88s]  That's a real monster.
[10951.88s -> 10961.67s]  I just want to make sure.
[10961.67s -> 10963.67s]  So I've got to burn smoke guy,
[10963.67s -> 10965.67s]  don't look at lady, look at statue.
[10965.67s -> 10975.34s]  I'm going to have to like,
[10975.34s -> 10977.34s]  I'm going to have to wipe down this visor.
[10977.34s -> 10979.70s]  It's so dirty from my sweat.
[10979.70s -> 10993.85s]  Give me like a lucky break right here.
[10993.85s -> 10995.85s]  And it's right here. I don't even care about that.
[10995.85s -> 10997.85s]  This is a difficult lock. Let's just get it open.
[10997.85s -> 10999.85s]  I hear somebody.
[10999.85s -> 11007.13s]  I hear something.
[11007.13s -> 11013.53s]  Is that the gargoyle?
[11013.53s -> 11020.31s]  What the fuck is that?
[11020.31s -> 11024.47s]  What did I do about the giant dog?
[11026.47s -> 11049.11s]  This has been like a YouTuber scream stream.
[11049.11s -> 11051.11s]  This has been just like,
[11051.11s -> 11058.28s]  welcome to my YouTube channel.
[11058.28s -> 11060.28s]  I scream at horror games.
[11060.28s -> 11063.54s]  Thankfully, thank God I'm standing up in a position
[11063.54s -> 11065.54s]  where I'm away from the microphone.
[11065.54s -> 11067.54s]  The mic would have peaked like 16 times tonight.
[11067.54s -> 11069.54s]  Thank God it's bouncing off the walls.
[11069.54s -> 11071.78s]  That guy was huge.
[11071.78s -> 11076.33s]  Oh, that sucks.
[11076.33s -> 11078.33s]  Oh,
[11078.33s -> 11080.33s]  that thing's ridiculous.
[11080.33s -> 11082.95s]  Where's the right way to look?
[11082.95s -> 11086.09s]  I think it's so scary.
[11086.09s -> 11092.86s]  It's so much bigger than everything, too.
[11092.86s -> 11095.42s]  And this is all procedurally generated.
[11095.42s -> 11097.42s]  Now that I know he exists,
[11097.42s -> 11104.58s]  I don't want to play anymore.
[11104.58s -> 11106.58s]  Is he
[11106.58s -> 11138.70s]  coming down this hall?
[11138.70s -> 11140.70s]  I think he's behind me.
[11140.70s -> 11145.37s]  Hello?
[11145.37s -> 11151.94s]  Somebody's opened a door.
[11151.94s -> 11154.50s]  Can he open doors?
[11154.50s -> 11156.50s]  Can he open doors?
[11156.50s -> 11172.68s]  Shh, calm down. I'm gonna hate these little rooms.
[11172.68s -> 11178.55s]  I'm gonna come out here and bang him right.
[11178.55s -> 11192.17s]  Can he open doors?
[11192.17s -> 11206.89s]  Do you hear something?
[11206.89s -> 11235.50s]  Shit! Shit, man!
[11235.50s -> 11245.22s]  Okay, it's gonna be right here to the left.
[11245.22s -> 11251.61s]  It's gonna be in this room.
[11251.61s -> 11254.09s]  Damn it! It's not in there.
[11254.09s -> 11258.89s]  I don't even want to go in there.
[11258.89s -> 11268.81s]  It's gonna be right in here, right to the left, and right in this room.
[11268.81s -> 11271.24s]  Oh, thank God it's one of those sanctuary rooms.
[11271.24s -> 11273.48s]  Oh, yes.
[11273.48s -> 11284.28s]  I'm safe in here, right?
[11284.28s -> 11289.40s]  Thank God. I just heard a person.
[11289.40s -> 11292.84s]  I just heard a person.
[11292.84s -> 11301.99s]  Are we certain of this?
[11301.99s -> 11319.78s]  Why did I hear somebody's voice?
[11319.78s -> 11322.09s]  It's right in here, right?
[11322.09s -> 11329.51s]  Don't do me like this.
[11329.51s -> 11338.22s]  Don't do me like this.
[11338.22s -> 11357.21s]  Don't do me like this.
[11357.21s -> 11359.70s]  I hear something.
[11359.70s -> 11369.29s]  Bullshit! That's a lady, right?
[11369.29s -> 11372.04s]  No, what does that mean?
[11372.04s -> 11374.04s]  I don't know what that thing means.
[11374.04s -> 11376.79s]  I think that attracts people.
[11376.79s -> 11380.31s]  No, that attracts a bad person.
[11380.31s -> 11382.62s]  Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Is it the smoke?
[11382.62s -> 11389.53s]  Is it smoke?
[11389.53s -> 11392.15s]  I think the smoke guy is literally right behind me.
[11392.15s -> 11394.15s]  I think it's smoke.
[11394.15s -> 11396.84s]  I don't know what to do. I'm scared.
[11396.84s -> 11398.84s]  I'm not gonna answer it. Just give me the keys.
[11398.84s -> 11401.40s]  Just give me the keys.
[11401.40s -> 11403.40s]  Just give me the fucking keys. Where are the keys?
[11403.40s -> 11405.40s]  Just give me the keys.
[11405.40s -> 11407.40s]  I looked everywhere. Where are the goddamn keys?
[11407.40s -> 11409.40s]  Where are the goddamn keys? I don't even know what I'm looking at here.
[11409.40s -> 11418.23s]  What the fuck is this?
[11418.23s -> 11422.26s]  Motherfucker. Come on.
[11422.26s -> 11435.62s]  It's gonna be in this room.
[11435.62s -> 11438.57s]  You son of a bitch.
[11438.57s -> 11440.57s]  Smoke guy.
[11440.57s -> 11442.57s]  How dare you?
[11442.57s -> 11448.90s]  What? Look at him!
[11448.90s -> 11450.90s]  What the fuck?
[11450.90s -> 11463.62s]  What happened?
[11463.62s -> 11471.37s]  I was holding the lantern in his face.
[11471.37s -> 11480.20s]  Was there no oil in the lamp?
[11480.20s -> 11482.20s]  Not enough oil?
[11482.20s -> 11494.23s]  Didn't I just fill it?
[11496.23s -> 11503.72s]  Shadows don't care.
[11503.72s -> 11506.86s]  It needs to be refilled immediately.
[11506.86s -> 11511.34s]  I checked so many places too.
[11511.34s -> 11513.34s]  I checked so many places too.
[11513.34s -> 11515.64s]  That whole map was uncovered.
[11515.64s -> 11517.64s]  And I only had the two places I didn't go.
[11517.64s -> 11519.64s]  And I only had the two places I didn't go.
[11519.64s -> 11522.26s]  I got destroyed.
[11522.26s -> 11527.13s]  Gonna talk to the face on the wall.
[11527.13s -> 11535.96s]  This thing.
[11535.96s -> 11539.03s]  Why did you wake us?
[11539.03s -> 11541.03s]  Paid two coins. But what?
[11541.03s -> 11543.66s]  What am I paying for?
[11543.66s -> 11545.66s]  You have 21 old coins. You wish to pay the price?
[11545.66s -> 11558.70s]  Ask.
[11558.70s -> 11560.70s]  You were drawn here by the shadows.
[11560.70s -> 11562.70s]  Enthralled by them.
[11562.70s -> 11564.70s]  It was you who stepped into the darkness.
[11564.70s -> 11566.70s]  It was you who chose to be bound by it.
[11566.70s -> 11568.70s]  It was you who chose to be bound by it.
[11568.70s -> 11570.70s]  You are nothing but their pawn.
[11570.70s -> 11573.00s]  Did this cost me two dollars for that?
[11573.00s -> 11579.34s]  Did this cost me two dollars for that?
[11579.34s -> 11583.18s]  Now you're gonna go in a shell?
[11583.18s -> 11585.18s]  There's two bucks.
[11585.18s -> 11598.41s]  Okay.
[11598.41s -> 11601.54s]  I'm so close too.
[11601.54s -> 11603.54s]  Damn. I had it.
[11603.54s -> 11605.54s]  It was so much stress but I almost did it.
[11605.54s -> 11607.54s]  I was almost ready. I was almost out of there.
[11607.54s -> 11612.60s]  I gotta make sure I'm in the right spot here.
[11612.60s -> 11619.38s]  I thought it was dark in this room.
[11619.38s -> 11622.58s]  Alright. Let's just start here.
[11622.58s -> 11625.66s]  I'm gonna try again.
[11625.66s -> 11627.66s]  I felt something just on my neck but it's my sweat.
[11627.66s -> 11630.28s]  A sweat bead just went down the back of my neck.
[11630.28s -> 11632.28s]  And I thought it was a bug.
[11632.28s -> 11636.95s]  Jesus.
[11636.95s -> 11638.95s]  Can I talk to this thing?
[11638.95s -> 11645.80s]  This thing doesn't want to speak to me.
[11645.80s -> 11650.54s]  Alright.
[11650.54s -> 11659.93s]  I was so close.
[11659.93s -> 11668.25s]  Just let me get lucky here.
[11668.25s -> 11691.16s]  What if I just hold my fist?
[11691.16s -> 11693.16s]  Oh my fucking Jesus! My God!
[11693.16s -> 11698.47s]  You can't get in here!
[11726.82s -> 11732.84s]  Come on. Just give me the key.
[11732.84s -> 11735.34s]  Let me get out of this fucking place.
[11735.34s -> 11747.62s]  Where's that dog again?
[11747.62s -> 11752.04s]  Where's that darn dog?
[11752.04s -> 11757.29s]  The lady's in here with me.
[11757.29s -> 11759.29s]  Close the door.
[11759.29s -> 11766.90s]  Just leave me the fuck alone.
[11766.90s -> 11768.90s]  I can't believe it.
[11768.90s -> 11774.79s]  Can't believe it that she's in here.
[11774.79s -> 11783.05s]  And is there a smoke monster?
[11783.05s -> 11785.05s]  Can you spawn in here as well?
[11785.05s -> 11787.05s]  You've got to be fucking shitting me, sir.
[11789.42s -> 11793.32s]  Okay, well that was fun at the party.
[11793.32s -> 11795.32s]  The fucking scary people.
[11798.12s -> 11800.12s]  The scary people party. That was fun of us to go out and hang out here.
[11821.11s -> 11823.11s]  A full squad just landed on me.
[11823.11s -> 11826.82s]  I have to go that way.
[11826.82s -> 11831.37s]  I have to go this way.
[11831.37s -> 11834.44s]  Get me out of the doorway, please.
[11839.03s -> 11842.79s]  Sanctuary room.
[11842.79s -> 11844.79s]  Ah.
[11844.79s -> 11846.79s]  Show me with light in the
[11846.79s -> 11848.79s]  sanctuary room of our father.
[11848.79s -> 11855.30s]  Thank God.
[11855.30s -> 11857.30s]  What the hell do you want to tell me, lady?
[11857.30s -> 11863.38s]  What is your question?
[11863.38s -> 11867.03s]  About the coins.
[11867.03s -> 11869.03s]  Token of devotion.
[11869.03s -> 11871.03s]  What? What?
[11871.03s -> 11873.03s]  What? What?
[11873.03s -> 11875.03s]  What? What?
[11875.03s -> 11878.81s]  What is it?
[11878.81s -> 11880.81s]  What is it? Something in my
[11880.81s -> 11882.81s]  sanctuary room? Something in my
[11882.81s -> 11885.69s]  sanctuary room?
[11885.69s -> 11888.50s]  Is it the lady?
[11888.50s -> 11892.02s]  What are you doing in my fucking room?
[11892.02s -> 11899.96s]  Guys?
[11909.58s -> 11912.71s]  Let's go over here.
[11920.71s -> 11922.71s]  This is horrible.
[11922.71s -> 11924.71s]  This is the most stressed I've ever been on a stream.
[11924.71s -> 11927.40s]  Am I? Ever.
[11927.40s -> 11929.64s]  This is the most stressed I've ever been.
[11929.64s -> 11931.64s]  It's the fucking lady again. They're just like dumping on me.
[11931.64s -> 11933.64s]  They're collapsing on me.
[11933.64s -> 11936.01s]  Light in the lantern. I don't have any more light.
[11936.01s -> 11938.76s]  Left trigger. Turn the light back on.
[11938.76s -> 11940.76s]  What the fuck is happening?
[11940.76s -> 11944.15s]  Why is this happening to me?
[11944.15s -> 11946.65s]  They're relentless.
[11946.65s -> 11948.82s]  They are relentless.
[11948.82s -> 11954.38s]  I think I've had enough fun.
[11954.38s -> 11956.38s]  I think it's time for me to
[11956.38s -> 11958.38s]  do something else.
[11958.38s -> 11961.06s]  I'm going to go take a bath.
[11961.06s -> 11963.06s]  God damn it.
[11963.06s -> 11969.98s]  I hear the dog now.
[11969.98s -> 11971.98s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[11971.98s -> 11973.98s]  Give it to me. Come on.
[11973.98s -> 11975.98s]  Give me the key. It's got to be right in here.
[11975.98s -> 11983.19s]  I don't have any more lantern oil.
[11983.19s -> 11985.19s]  Do I? Nope.
[11985.19s -> 11988.57s]  Right here. Key.
[11988.57s -> 11990.57s]  Do it. Key.
[11992.57s -> 11994.94s]  Yeah.
[11994.94s -> 12003.32s]  Thank God.
[12003.32s -> 12011.00s]  Man, this is unbelievable.
[12011.00s -> 12013.00s]  Now I see why people wanted me to play this.
[12013.00s -> 12015.82s]  This is like one of the nerve wracking.
[12015.82s -> 12017.82s]  There's so many people surrounding you that have different
[12017.82s -> 12021.27s]  traits.
[12021.27s -> 12024.22s]  Wait. Should I learn some more info?
[12024.22s -> 12026.22s]  I'm going to summon a demon right now.
[12026.22s -> 12029.78s]  Is it too late?
[12029.78s -> 12032.02s]  No.
[12032.02s -> 12041.11s]  There it is. There's another level.
[12041.11s -> 12043.42s]  Yes. I'd like to talk.
[12043.42s -> 12045.42s]  Oh, man.
[12045.42s -> 12049.45s]  We demand payment.
[12049.45s -> 12051.45s]  Ask why only one...
[12051.45s -> 12053.45s]  Where were you before?
[12053.45s -> 12055.45s]  Another wanderer.
[12055.45s -> 12057.45s]  From beyond the walls of this world.
[12063.90s -> 12065.90s]  I'd rather just sell these tokens
[12065.90s -> 12074.47s]  on eBay.
[12074.47s -> 12076.47s]  You can probably get like a hundred bucks
[12076.47s -> 12078.47s]  per token. Some ancient artifact?
[12078.47s -> 12080.47s]  Are you kidding me?
[12080.47s -> 12082.47s]  Alright, well, let's see what's in store here.
[12082.47s -> 12085.35s]  Make sure I'm facing the right way.
[12085.35s -> 12090.01s]  I am.
[12090.01s -> 12094.55s]  There's more.
[12094.55s -> 12096.55s]  I actually have to do more of this shit.
[12096.55s -> 12105.06s]  This looks different.
[12105.06s -> 12110.82s]  Is this different?
[12110.82s -> 12122.52s]  What is this for?
[12122.52s -> 12135.32s]  Hey, I need some...
[12135.32s -> 12137.62s]  We demand payment.
[12137.62s -> 12139.62s]  Ask about the corpses. Ask about...
[12139.62s -> 12141.62s]  All the wanderers just like you
[12141.62s -> 12143.62s]  judged unworthy,
[12143.62s -> 12145.62s]  devoured by the shadows.
[12145.62s -> 12147.62s]  Okay.
[12147.62s -> 12152.62s]  Now it's three coins.
[12152.62s -> 12154.62s]  Your price went up.
[12154.62s -> 12157.62s]  What the hell? I can die from that thing?
[12157.62s -> 12160.89s]  I only have...
[12160.89s -> 12168.63s]  oil.
[12168.63s -> 12170.63s]  Fuck off with this.
[12170.63s -> 12183.16s]  What the hell is this?
[12183.16s -> 12191.80s]  What the hell is this?
[12191.80s -> 12193.80s]  Oh, you're going to make me do like a gauntlet here?
[12193.80s -> 12195.80s]  Well, this is fun, guys.
[12195.80s -> 12197.80s]  Thanks for playing. Thanks for hanging out.
[12197.80s -> 12199.80s]  The stone here is colder, sharper. I think I'm getting
[12199.80s -> 12201.80s]  closer to the pillars. I can hear their call.
[12201.80s -> 12205.96s]  This was Blast.
[12205.96s -> 12209.22s]  I hope you guys enjoyed it.
[12222.52s -> 12224.82s]  Give me some oil or something.
[12224.82s -> 12231.93s]  I mean, this is like a new hub world.
[12231.93s -> 12238.97s]  This is not going to be a new hub world,
[12238.97s -> 12244.60s]  right? It doesn't look like it.
[12244.60s -> 12249.85s]  It is a new hub world.
[12249.85s -> 12257.70s]  This game is
[12257.70s -> 12259.70s]  ten hours.
[12259.70s -> 12261.70s]  What?
[12261.70s -> 12263.70s]  This is like a 30 minute
[12263.70s -> 12265.70s]  stream experience.
[12265.70s -> 12278.42s]  It only takes so much of this in one sitting.
[12278.42s -> 12295.64s]  Ridiculous, though. Look at how much bigger
[12295.64s -> 12298.52s]  the areas are.
[12298.52s -> 12302.10s]  This is times two.
[12302.10s -> 12305.56s]  The amount of stress.
[12305.56s -> 12323.29s]  I can't even speak.
[12323.29s -> 12325.29s]  See you later. That's enough.
[12325.29s -> 12327.46s]  That's enough.
[12327.46s -> 12329.46s]  Yeah, that's enough.
[12329.46s -> 12337.53s]  I'm just going to walk over here and turn it off.
[12337.53s -> 12345.91s]  That's enough.
[12345.91s -> 12365.69s]  See you later. Bye.
[12365.69s -> 12373.11s]  Coward.
[12373.11s -> 12375.11s]  No, I can't.
[12375.11s -> 12381.00s]  I'll take beating the first area.
[12381.00s -> 12385.99s]  Finish it. Finish it.
[12385.99s -> 12387.99s]  I'm going to go ahead and go for...
[12387.99s -> 12389.99s]  We're going to play the boxing game.
[12389.99s -> 12393.00s]  I have not left the game.
[12393.00s -> 12395.00s]  That's right. I think there's a monster about to come over to me.
[12395.00s -> 12400.70s]  I'm going to play it with the OBS preview.
[12400.70s -> 12414.06s]  Ugh.
[12414.06s -> 12423.66s]  Copy the Wii.
[12423.66s -> 12425.66s]  You were almost done. You were one guide super hard.
[12425.66s -> 12429.62s]  Really? You got one
[12429.62s -> 12434.81s]  guide. Where's this lady?
[12434.81s -> 12454.76s]  She's not even here.
[12454.76s -> 12460.07s]  At least see the monster.
[12460.07s -> 12462.07s]  I'll at least see what the monster is.
[12462.07s -> 12464.44s]  And then I'm going to take another quick break.
[12464.44s -> 12466.44s]  Come back and we'll do the boxing game for a little while.
[12466.44s -> 12469.45s]  Alright, let's go see the monster.
[12469.45s -> 12515.08s]  No, I'll look it up on YouTube.
[12515.08s -> 12517.08s]  I'm going to YouTube it.
[12517.08s -> 12525.53s]  It's so quiet. I'll look it up on YouTube.
[12525.53s -> 12563.78s]  No, I'll look it up on YouTube.
[12563.78s -> 12565.78s]  Right around this corner.
[12565.78s -> 12567.78s]  Pretend I'm on a YouTube video.
[12567.78s -> 12572.71s]  I'm on a YouTube VR video.
[12572.71s -> 12574.71s]  I don't know what it is. Is it in here?
[12595.24s -> 12598.38s]  I got
[12598.38s -> 12600.74s]  this
[12600.74s -> 12602.74s]  I can't
[12602.74s -> 12605.11s]  I can't
[12605.11s -> 12607.11s]  I can't do it.
[12607.11s -> 12609.11s]  I can't
[12609.11s -> 12624.47s]  I can't do it.
[12624.47s -> 12629.98s]  It's so big.
[12629.98s -> 12631.98s]  Why did you wake us?
[12631.98s -> 12635.24s]  We must speak
[12635.24s -> 12637.24s]  when you bring payment.
[12637.24s -> 12639.24s]  Those are the rules, and we will follow them.
[12639.24s -> 12641.24s]  But we are not here for your
[12641.24s -> 12643.24s]  amusement, Wanderer.
[12643.24s -> 12647.34s]  It's fucking fantastic.
[12647.34s -> 12649.83s]  Here we go.
[12649.83s -> 12652.20s]  I'm ready. Let's go. Come on.
[12652.20s -> 12668.49s]  One more.
[12668.49s -> 12670.49s]  What's the gimmick for this new guy?
[12670.49s -> 12679.56s]  What's the gimmick for the new guy?
[12679.56s -> 12681.74s]  What's the gimmick for the new guy?
[12681.74s -> 12687.94s]  That's how I see red.
[12687.94s -> 12690.31s]  What does that mean?
[12690.31s -> 12696.50s]  Oh shit.
[12696.50s -> 12698.50s]  He's attracted to light. Why did you just tell me to do that?
[12698.50s -> 12703.18s]  What the hell is that guy?
[12703.18s -> 12705.18s]  How do I blow it out?
[12705.18s -> 12721.42s]  Do I have to stand still?
[12721.42s -> 12723.42s]  Jesus Christ.
[12723.42s -> 12727.58s]  Dog.
[12727.58s -> 12729.58s]  Is it a dog?
[12729.58s -> 12731.58s]  It's the dog, isn't it?
[12731.58s -> 12734.07s]  Is it the dog?
[12734.07s -> 12739.26s]  Yeah, it is. What?
[12739.26s -> 12741.26s]  Be in here.
[12741.26s -> 12744.50s]  Be in here.
[12749.06s -> 12756.04s]  I'm regressing.
[12756.04s -> 12760.89s]  I'm regressing.
[12760.89s -> 12763.58s]  I don't even know what it said.
[12763.58s -> 12767.10s]  I have no idea. We gotta go.
[12767.10s -> 12769.10s]  I'm just regressing to noises and shit.
[12769.10s -> 12773.51s]  I'm gone forever.
[12773.51s -> 12775.51s]  Right through this door. You gotta be in here.
[12790.15s -> 12796.49s]  Let's see what this lady has to say.
[12796.49s -> 12798.49s]  Oh no. Oh no.
[12798.49s -> 12800.49s]  Shut. What?
[12800.49s -> 12802.98s]  Don't leave me alone.
[12802.98s -> 12804.98s]  What's this say?
[12804.98s -> 12806.98s]  An ear piercing scream suddenly filled the dungeon without us sleeping.
[12806.98s -> 12808.98s]  It took me a few seconds to realize it was mine.
[12808.98s -> 12810.98s]  Get off the screen.
[12810.98s -> 12814.82s]  Look at how far away this took me. I don't care.
[12814.82s -> 12816.82s]  Son of a bitch.
[12816.82s -> 12819.19s]  Procedurally random generated.
[12819.19s -> 12837.62s]  Do these things attack?
[12837.62s -> 12842.68s]  One, two, three, go.
[12842.68s -> 12855.61s]  I woke up. Who cares?
[12855.61s -> 12868.92s]  Give me the eye.
[12868.92s -> 12870.92s]  I've gone so far around this whole damn thing.
[12872.92s -> 12885.27s]  Oh no, it's the dog.
[12885.27s -> 12891.35s]  But where is it?
[12891.35s -> 12894.49s]  Which way is the dog?
[12924.70s -> 12929.48s]  You stupid lady.
[12929.48s -> 12944.39s]  Fucking close.
[12944.39s -> 12956.87s]  I gotta be close.
[12956.87s -> 12961.61s]  It's the lady.
[12961.61s -> 12966.15s]  Come on, look at this shit.
[12966.15s -> 12969.35s]  Oh no.
[12969.35s -> 12973.45s]  I gotta go to the left,
[12973.45s -> 12976.52s]  and then out, and then right.
[12976.52s -> 12993.38s]  Is she here? The lady.
[12993.38s -> 12995.88s]  How did he get in there?
[12995.88s -> 12998.57s]  He can go down there? Not even possible.
[12998.57s -> 13000.57s]  Oh my god.
[13000.57s -> 13002.57s]  It's not the dog, it's that guy.
[13002.57s -> 13004.57s]  It's that bad guy. He looks like a fucking goat.
[13004.57s -> 13006.57s]  Okay.
[13006.57s -> 13011.11s]  End this.
[13011.11s -> 13013.11s]  End this.
[13013.11s -> 13024.70s]  Oh shit.
[13024.70s -> 13028.15s]  It's up there.
[13028.15s -> 13030.15s]  Oh fuck off, will ya?
[13030.15s -> 13032.15s]  Look at how much of this. I beat it, I win.
[13032.15s -> 13036.70s]  Hello?
[13036.70s -> 13040.02s]  Should I not have done that?
[13040.02s -> 13044.12s]  I maybe should not have done that.
[13044.12s -> 13048.28s]  What's the fastest way for me to get there?
[13048.28s -> 13050.78s]  Bang up right, and then bang up right.
[13050.78s -> 13057.46s]  Straighten.
[13057.46s -> 13059.46s]  Motherfucker, just pretend I beat it.
[13059.46s -> 13063.93s]  I don't know what it is.
[13063.93s -> 13065.93s]  That's a thing!
[13065.93s -> 13069.64s]  What is that thing? I don't know!
[13069.64s -> 13071.82s]  Should I stop moving?
[13071.82s -> 13081.78s]  I don't know what it is, I'm just gonna die.
[13081.78s -> 13090.10s]  Go!
[13090.10s -> 13092.10s]  Fuck you!
[13092.10s -> 13094.10s]  You can't do this to me.
[13094.10s -> 13096.10s]  You can't do this to me.
[13096.10s -> 13103.13s]  How close I am.
[13103.13s -> 13105.43s]  One little bit, right here.
[13105.43s -> 13111.00s]  Oh my god, I win. I beat the game.
[13111.00s -> 13113.43s]  Open!
[13113.43s -> 13119.51s]  Open?
[13119.51s -> 13129.86s]  Jesus.
[13129.86s -> 13137.80s]  I stuck it through when I did it.
[13137.80s -> 13139.80s]  That's the end.
[13139.80s -> 13141.80s]  I'll see the ending cutscene, please.
[13141.80s -> 13143.80s]  Hey, the ending cutscene.
[13143.80s -> 13161.14s]  Give it to me.
[13161.14s -> 13177.64s]  I hope this is the end.
[13177.64s -> 13185.00s]  Is this not it?
[13185.00s -> 13188.58s]  I thought this was it.
[13188.58s -> 13216.94s]  Is it an eyeball?
[13216.94s -> 13224.81s]  I thought you guessed it was the end of the game.
[13224.81s -> 13244.20s]  Is this supposed to be like a cutscene?
[13244.20s -> 13246.20s]  Like the ending cutscene?
[13246.20s -> 13248.76s]  I don't know.
[13248.76s -> 13259.00s]  I mean, it looks pretty linear.
[13261.01s -> 13266.64s]  Only two more.
[13266.64s -> 13268.64s]  New hub, two more, two more.
[13268.64s -> 13278.61s]  No, I gotta get out of that.
[13278.61s -> 13282.51s]  That game is a ton of fun and it's so stressful.
[13282.51s -> 13284.51s]  But, I can't do that anymore.
[13284.51s -> 13289.87s]  It's gonna actually kill me.
[13289.87s -> 13296.21s]  So we're gonna move on.
[13296.21s -> 13298.21s]  We're probably gonna end on...
[13298.21s -> 13300.21s]  I was gonna play Mind Show, but I don't know if I'm gonna have enough time to do it.
[13300.21s -> 13304.28s]  I feel like I'm gonna have to start with Mind Show.
[13304.28s -> 13307.22s]  Because I've exhausted myself.
[13307.22s -> 13312.17s]  I'm gonna have to start with Mind Show another day.
[13313.66s -> 13318.08s]  No, Mind Show, not Minecraft.
[13318.08s -> 13323.52s]  Let me take another break.
[13323.52s -> 13325.52s]  I'm just gonna get some more water thrown in my face.
[13325.52s -> 13331.10s]  And we'll come back and we might just play the boxing game for like a little while.
[13331.10s -> 13336.35s]  I'll be right back.
[13336.35s -> 13341.60s]  What? Is something in here?
[13341.60s -> 13361.30s]  I don't see anything.
[13361.30s -> 13366.99s]  Alright, I'll see you guys in a minute.
[13366.99s -> 13368.99s]  I can't leave up track to the game.
[13368.99s -> 13602.32s]  Okay. Hello again.
[13602.32s -> 13608.66s]  We are now gonna jump into...
[13608.66s -> 13612.05s]  Oh, let's see.
[13612.05s -> 13617.21s]  Something like easy and relaxing.
[13617.21s -> 13625.12s]  Although I'm not entirely sure that the boxing game will be very relaxing.
[13625.12s -> 13632.66s]  Let's do it.
[13632.66s -> 13638.67s]  What the hell is it there? It's Creed.
[13638.67s -> 13653.52s]  This looks really fun, actually.
[13653.52s -> 13659.17s]  I can't even remember what I was even saying during that stream.
[13659.17s -> 13662.17s]  Hopefully that was an interesting experience for all of you.
[13662.17s -> 13669.21s]  Have I done Superhot? Yeah, I did a Superhot VR last week.
[13669.21s -> 13674.65s]  Let's try Creed.
[13674.65s -> 13684.42s]  Alright, going back in.
[13686.88s -> 13689.18s]  What's the battery life on these things?
[13689.18s -> 13698.66s]  Should I turn the lights back up?
[13698.66s -> 13702.94s]  I probably should.
[13702.94s -> 13706.34s]  Let me turn the lights on.
[13706.34s -> 13719.06s]  A bit higher than they are now. That's better.
[13719.06s -> 13728.98s]  That looks good.
[13728.98s -> 13731.98s]  So I heard this game is pretty realistic.
[13731.98s -> 13733.98s]  It really feels like you're fighting.
[13733.98s -> 13740.76s]  Press any button to calibrate.
[13740.76s -> 13763.27s]  So press any button to calibrate.
[13763.27s -> 13765.27s]  What the fuck?
[13765.27s -> 13768.15s]  That's not correct.
[13768.15s -> 13771.80s]  That doesn't look right.
[13771.80s -> 13776.46s]  Hold on. What happened there?
[13776.46s -> 13783.66s]  Stop stream. End of the stream.
[13783.66s -> 13788.27s]  I think that's better.
[13788.27s -> 13792.50s]  Hey, look. There we go.
[13792.50s -> 13799.20s]  This is also pretty wild.
[13799.20s -> 13802.66s]  Ok. Alright.
[13802.66s -> 13804.66s]  Career. Free play. Options.
[13804.66s -> 13806.66s]  Am I standing in a good spot?
[13806.66s -> 13810.48s]  Ok.
[13810.48s -> 13812.48s]  Gameplay. Graphics. Gameplay. Comfort mode.
[13812.48s -> 13814.48s]  On. Reset profile. Advanced.
[13814.48s -> 13817.42s]  Local motion. What does that mean?
[13817.42s -> 13829.01s]  Yeah, I know it's times two. Don't worry.
[13829.01s -> 13842.56s]  Gameplay. Let's just go through it.
[13842.56s -> 13847.04s]  Career. Pro.
[13847.04s -> 13856.18s]  I probably should change the title too. I didn't.
[13856.18s -> 13858.61s]  Delta Gym.
[13858.61s -> 13860.61s]  Seven months before underground championship.
[13860.61s -> 13863.30s]  Oh, this is cool.
[13863.30s -> 13865.30s]  I thought that was me.
[13865.30s -> 13868.05s]  Actually me.
[13868.05s -> 13870.05s]  Hold the trackpad while swinging your arms.
[13870.05s -> 13877.79s]  Ok.
[13877.79s -> 13882.98s]  Anything else you'd like to tell me?
[13882.98s -> 13888.42s]  Oh. Punch.
[13888.42s -> 13896.48s]  Punch harder for more damage.
[13896.48s -> 13909.28s]  Harder than that.
[13911.28s -> 13913.28s]  These are going to fly off.
[13915.71s -> 13917.89s]  This is kind of cutting off circulation.
[13917.89s -> 13919.89s]  How am I using a cell phone with these on?
[13919.89s -> 13921.89s]  Come on in.
[13921.89s -> 13923.89s]  Teach me.
[13923.89s -> 13933.47s]  Hey, there he is.
[13933.47s -> 13936.10s]  Let me show you what I can do.
[13936.10s -> 13938.34s]  Huh?
[13938.34s -> 13940.83s]  I just used all my energy.
[13940.83s -> 13943.20s]  I don't think I can even make it over there.
[13943.20s -> 13945.20s]  What? Oh.
[13945.20s -> 13952.62s]  Ok. Hold on.
[13952.62s -> 13954.62s]  Whoa.
[13954.62s -> 13965.81s]  Let's go. Train me.
[13965.81s -> 13968.50s]  Hey, Bonham.
[13968.50s -> 13970.50s]  Hey, Bonham.
[13970.50s -> 13972.50s]  I got to tie this.
[13972.50s -> 13974.80s]  This is going to be tighter.
[13974.80s -> 13978.96s]  I'm going to move around so much this is going to be bad.
[13978.96s -> 13990.93s]  This is going to fly off my head.
[13990.93s -> 13993.36s]  Ok. Defend with gloves.
[13993.36s -> 13995.36s]  Sounds easy enough.
[13995.36s -> 14002.40s]  Dodge punches to trigger slow-mo.
[14002.40s -> 14004.40s]  I'm going to see you guys every time.
[14004.40s -> 14007.47s]  Dodge punches to trigger slow-mo.
[14012.22s -> 14014.22s]  Do I have enough room?
[14014.22s -> 14016.22s]  I will break something here.
[14018.22s -> 14020.98s]  Finish exercise as quick as possible.
[14020.98s -> 14022.98s]  Ok.
[14022.98s -> 14025.54s]  Stand in the center of your play space.
[14025.54s -> 14030.91s]  While counting down.
[14030.91s -> 14034.82s]  Rapidly hit the target.
[14034.82s -> 14043.82s]  Swing.
[14043.82s -> 14049.20s]  This is like happening too fast.
[14049.20s -> 14076.26s]  Did I do good?
[14076.26s -> 14081.82s]  Come on. Bring it on.
[14081.82s -> 14083.82s]  I wanted a relaxing game.
[14083.82s -> 14094.38s]  Ten exceptions to training.
[14094.38s -> 14096.38s]  Training determines stamina.
[14098.38s -> 14100.38s]  Hands are slower and weaker while tired.
[14100.38s -> 14102.38s]  Punching consumes stamina.
[14104.38s -> 14107.58s]  Keep hands still to recover stamina.
[14107.58s -> 14111.87s]  Not enough oxygen is going into his brain.
[14111.87s -> 14116.74s]  I'm fine. Don't worry.
[14116.74s -> 14126.85s]  First combatant.
[14126.85s -> 14130.86s]  Do you think you're going to take on me?
[14130.86s -> 14133.55s]  He's 0-12.
[14133.55s -> 14136.69s]  Well, what do you got?
[14136.69s -> 14141.74s]  Huh?
[14141.74s -> 14146.14s]  You're going to rip that off the bottom of your chin.
[14149.02s -> 14151.02s]  Keep this above the belt and inside the ring.
[14151.02s -> 14153.02s]  The fight starts as soon as you touch gloves.
[14153.02s -> 14155.52s]  Ok.
[14155.52s -> 14158.53s]  As soon as we touch gloves.
[14195.36s -> 14200.22s]  I didn't even let him count.
[14200.22s -> 14216.74s]  That's not how you box.
[14216.74s -> 14218.74s]  That's not how you box.
[14220.74s -> 14222.74s]  I would get thrown out of the gym.
[14222.74s -> 14224.98s]  I'm trying to get him in the stomach.
[14226.98s -> 14231.33s]  That's not how I would get tossed.
[14231.33s -> 14252.69s]  Dammit.
[14252.69s -> 14258.24s]  He's done.
[14258.24s -> 14261.06s]  He's out.
[14290.75s -> 14294.14s]  How is he going to go out?
[14294.14s -> 14312.58s]  What?
[14312.58s -> 14320.58s]  Whoa, what did I hit?
[14322.58s -> 14325.33s]  I'm going to go for the legs.
[14344.14s -> 14354.58s]  Where am I going?
[14354.58s -> 14356.58s]  I just beat the shit out of his head.
[14356.58s -> 14379.41s]  5.
[14379.41s -> 14387.02s]  Fuck you.
[14387.02s -> 14389.58s]  You want to come fuck with me?
[14389.58s -> 14397.06s]  Don't wake that up.
[14397.06s -> 14407.02s]  Label.
[14407.02s -> 14415.15s]  I did it.
[14415.15s -> 14418.10s]  This trip is tired.
[14418.10s -> 14421.49s]  I am.
[14421.49s -> 14425.46s]  Come on, I need this exercise though.
[14425.46s -> 14427.63s]  That was fucking funny.
[14427.63s -> 14429.63s]  I showed that motherfucker who's boss.
[14429.63s -> 14434.62s]  Yeah.
[14434.62s -> 14443.01s]  Where?
[14458.69s -> 14460.69s]  Okay.
[14460.69s -> 14462.69s]  Dodge, punch the bag without missing.
[14462.69s -> 14464.69s]  Dodge when ball glows red.
[14464.69s -> 14475.76s]  Okay.
[14475.76s -> 14495.14s]  I win.
[14495.14s -> 14500.51s]  Hey.
[14500.51s -> 14510.62s]  Alright, let's go.
[14510.62s -> 14512.62s]  You and me in the ring.
[14512.62s -> 14515.89s]  Why is it counting?
[14515.89s -> 14519.02s]  What are you doing?
[14519.02s -> 14529.52s]  This has been the longest 3 seconds ever.
[14529.52s -> 14536.42s]  What the fuck?
[14536.42s -> 14566.80s]  Alright, come on.
[14566.80s -> 14568.80s]  I've done training. Let me fight the next guy.
[14568.80s -> 14581.78s]  Alright, go.
[14581.78s -> 14583.78s]  I don't care. I'll take 3 out of 5.
[14586.27s -> 14588.27s]  I will take the same rating as a pizza hut.
[14588.27s -> 14592.88s]  That's alright with me.
[14592.88s -> 14597.94s]  Yeah, begin fight. Let's go.
[14597.94s -> 14609.06s]  Who's next?
[14609.06s -> 14616.54s]  Come on. You're next.
[14616.54s -> 14619.30s]  In fact, you know what? Fuck this.
[14619.30s -> 14630.82s]  Oh, that's a guy I gotta fight.
[14630.82s -> 14633.50s]  This is not a thesis guy that has knockouts.
[14633.50s -> 14635.50s]  That's me.
[14635.50s -> 14649.76s]  Give me that fucking mic.
[14649.76s -> 14651.76s]  I got something to say.
[14669.14s -> 14689.49s]  Why would I do that?
[14689.49s -> 14691.49s]  Ooh, right in the face.
[14691.49s -> 14708.82s]  Get down.
[14708.82s -> 14723.39s]  Uh oh, easy.
[14723.39s -> 14726.02s]  Oh shit. What do I do?
[14738.43s -> 14740.43s]  I keep on getting knocked out.
[14740.43s -> 14742.43s]  Over and over again.
[14742.43s -> 14748.26s]  I get knocked out like 6 times.
[14748.26s -> 14780.50s]  What's wrong with my leg?
[14802.94s -> 14810.30s]  Oh, right in the fucking head.
[14814.14s -> 14818.50s]  Shit, I'm losing audio.
[14822.08s -> 14834.99s]  Hold on, I gotta put my head back.
[14834.99s -> 14836.99s]  Put my head back.
[14836.99s -> 14839.23s]  Put my head back.
[14841.60s -> 14843.90s]  It's time to play defensively.
[14843.90s -> 14864.43s]  I got him.
[14864.43s -> 14883.42s]  You're dead motherfucker.
[14887.20s -> 14889.20s]  Ah, I shattered my leg.
[14895.71s -> 14910.88s]  I was being a dick and I broke my leg in half.
[14910.88s -> 14915.92s]  Oh man.
[14915.92s -> 14917.92s]  I'm gonna be so sloppy in the next fight.
[14917.92s -> 14919.92s]  This is not fair.
[14919.92s -> 14922.61s]  Typical.
[14922.61s -> 14924.61s]  Typically you should fight in a boxing match.
[14924.61s -> 14926.61s]  You don't fight again 10 minutes later.
[14926.61s -> 14928.98s]  It takes like 6 months to recover.
[14928.98s -> 14944.64s]  Whatever.
[14944.64s -> 14947.52s]  What do you got for me?
[14950.40s -> 14952.40s]  More training?
[14952.40s -> 14954.40s]  Oh god.
[14954.40s -> 14956.70s]  Okay, I gotta...
[14956.70s -> 14959.01s]  Alright.
[14959.01s -> 14967.25s]  Alright, scan him.
[14967.25s -> 14980.03s]  You can't do it.
[14980.03s -> 14982.27s]  Hang on.
[14982.27s -> 14989.74s]  You're gonna kill me.
[14989.74s -> 14991.74s]  Don't have like a McDonald's rating.
[14991.74s -> 14994.05s]  That's all I care about.
[14994.05s -> 14996.05s]  No McDonald's rating and I'll be fine.
[15003.63s -> 15005.63s]  I have to have a better fucking local McDonald's.
[15021.30s -> 15027.57s]  Ah, shit.
[15027.57s -> 15029.57s]  I gotta do a new tactic on this next fight.
[15032.30s -> 15034.30s]  Here's the new tactic, you'll see.
[15034.30s -> 15038.53s]  Guaranteed victory.
[15038.53s -> 15040.53s]  I'm gonna Toy Story this fucking guy coming up.
[15040.53s -> 15051.28s]  Oh no, this is like a championship fight.
[15051.28s -> 15059.02s]  Oh shit.
[15059.02s -> 15061.65s]  This guy's huge.
[15061.65s -> 15070.98s]  Dwayne Reynolds.
[15070.98s -> 15072.98s]  He's 29 and 0.
[15072.98s -> 15080.51s]  Okay.
[15080.51s -> 15084.16s]  Here we go.
[15084.16s -> 15086.59s]  Oh boy.
[15086.59s -> 15091.58s]  Okay.
[15091.58s -> 15093.58s]  We got it.
[15095.58s -> 15099.28s]  Good luck.
[15099.28s -> 15102.16s]  Just wanna say, I respect you.
[15102.16s -> 15104.16s]  And I think you're a very good fighter.
[15104.16s -> 15106.16s]  And I've been looking up to you for a long time.
[15140.59s -> 15142.59s]  This would be the worst fight you could ever go to.
[15142.59s -> 15144.59s]  This would be embarrassing.
[15144.59s -> 15185.73s]  Work on the body.
[15185.73s -> 15194.99s]  Whoa, what?
[15194.99s -> 15199.41s]  I knocked him out.
[15199.41s -> 15205.34s]  God damn it.
[15247.31s -> 15256.53s]  Damn it.
[15256.53s -> 15258.83s]  Where the hell have you been?
[15258.83s -> 15272.00s]  I don't know how to dodge that.
[15318.98s -> 15323.71s]  No, come here.
[15323.71s -> 15330.03s]  No.
[15345.49s -> 15370.62s]  He's gonna get up.
[15370.62s -> 15375.66s]  He's gonna get up.
[15375.66s -> 15382.43s]  I'll get you this time.
[15382.43s -> 15385.12s]  Starting the fight on your back.
[15385.12s -> 15390.86s]  Starting the fight on your back.
[15390.86s -> 15392.86s]  No, I'll be fine.
[15392.86s -> 15395.87s]  I'll be fine.
[15395.87s -> 15397.87s]  Just give me a second.
[15417.30s -> 15419.66s]  Yes, that's me.
[15429.15s -> 15439.65s]  Alright.
[15439.65s -> 15441.65s]  Yeah, I'm ready.
[15441.65s -> 15443.65s]  Yeah, let's go motherfucker.
[15443.65s -> 15447.36s]  You and me.
[15447.36s -> 15475.97s]  There's this guy.
[15475.97s -> 15477.97s]  I'm gonna puke.
[15477.97s -> 15479.97s]  How do I grab? Can I grab him?
[15479.97s -> 15487.38s]  Come here.
[15487.38s -> 15491.79s]  Whoa, what?
[15491.79s -> 15496.14s]  Oh, am I supposed to be at my desk?
[15496.14s -> 15507.52s]  You know, it's too tired.
[15507.52s -> 15509.52s]  I can't.
[15509.52s -> 15513.28s]  He's been beaten up too many times.
[15513.28s -> 15518.66s]  He's been punched too many times in the face.
[15520.66s -> 15524.62s]  And so that's what I told him.
[15524.62s -> 15526.62s]  Like, oh, you're gonna go to the grocery store without me?
[15526.62s -> 15528.62s]  Make sure you pick up some Pringles.
[15528.62s -> 15530.62s]  You know what I'm saying?
[15530.62s -> 15535.15s]  God.
[15535.15s -> 15542.13s]  There's gotta be a strategy I can do here.
[15559.90s -> 15564.77s]  Check's activated!
[15606.74s -> 15615.30s]  Get out!
[15615.30s -> 15658.40s]  Get out!
[15658.40s -> 15667.41s]  Fuck!
[15667.41s -> 15718.99s]  No!
[15718.99s -> 15758.78s]  Alright.
[15758.78s -> 15763.76s]  Get back to the gym.
[15763.76s -> 15774.24s]  Maybe I'll put this over here for a
[15774.24s -> 15777.44s]  just a moment.
[15777.44s -> 15790.10s]  Put this over here.
[15790.10s -> 15792.10s]  One sip of soda is not hydration.
[15792.10s -> 15794.10s]  I'm alright.
[15794.10s -> 15798.62s]  I'll get some water.
[15798.62s -> 15800.62s]  I'll get some real water.
[15804.40s -> 15807.79s]  Let's go, hey, let's go play a
[15807.79s -> 15809.79s]  relaxing game.
[15809.79s -> 15814.58s]  I'll be right back.
