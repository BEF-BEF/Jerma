[1.34s -> 13.05s]  Okay, hello. Alright, so here are the options. We can start season two and do like episode one.
[14.62s -> 21.58s]  Or we can wait and actually dedicate a whole stream to doing like two to three episodes.
[25.82s -> 36.26s]  Or I open up Mordhau and now that progression actually works, be able to play and level up
[36.26s -> 45.40s]  and buy stuff and actually progress in that game. Those are the two options. I'm probably
[46.84s -> 57.29s]  I don't know. I'm not sure. I'm leaning towards... I'm torn because I really want to
[57.85s -> 63.10s]  level up in Mordhau just because I want to see what's in the game. And then we can save season
[63.10s -> 68.06s]  two for give it its whole stream. Give it even so I don't have to just do one episode or
[68.06s -> 83.53s]  one and a half episodes or something. Alright. Yeah, I think that's what's going to happen.
[88.18s -> 93.48s]  We're going to play Mordhau for a little bit and then Sam and Max season two
[94.28s -> 100.84s]  will dedicate it so we don't have to have it be one episode spread out and then two
[100.84s -> 111.43s]  episodes. I'd rather just do two or three episodes in one night. But season one concluded.
[117.54s -> 125.85s]  Why ask? Well, I'm just curious, you know. I mean, I'm going to do what I
[125.85s -> 132.17s]  feel like I would have the most fun doing right now. You know, season two would be fun,
[132.17s -> 146.06s]  but I'd rather dedicate it to a whole stream. I didn't put a poll up. I was just deciding.
[146.06s -> 157.96s]  I didn't put a poll up. What are you talking about? If I had put a poll up and left to
[157.96s -> 163.69s]  go to the bathroom and come back, then yeah, I didn't put up a poll. I was just
[163.69s -> 176.70s]  torn on what I was going to do. Alright, so let's change this over. Plus, I want to see
[176.70s -> 191.06s]  what's in that game. We didn't get a chance to see the other items. I did do a poll.
[191.14s -> 206.60s]  Yeah, I did the what I did. What color am I? Poll. How do you do the degree symbol?
[208.87s -> 222.79s]  It's like a little, it's a little O, right? Because I can't, it's fine. That's, that's,
[222.79s -> 252.49s]  that does not look correct. But who cares? 360 O's. Alright, let's open it up. Alright.
[253.21s -> 257.85s]  Thank you for watching Sam and Max. It will return. We will do a, we'll properly do
[257.85s -> 275.34s]  season two. That's not a lie. Look, if this is going to be a Jerma lied about Sam and
[275.34s -> 281.10s]  Max scenario, you wouldn't have seen season one today at all. I would have been like,
[281.10s -> 285.10s]  yeah, I don't know. I don't know if I, I don't think I'm going to do it today.
[285.10s -> 299.67s]  I would have been like, nah, I don't think so. Maybe next week. I didn't want to
[299.67s -> 318.22s]  conclude it though. Alright, open. Hopefully this is not too loud. It might be lying
[318.22s -> 333.94s]  about Minecraft story mode. Oh shit, I was trying to mute this. Everything has to be loud
[334.02s -> 342.36s]  as fuck. Don't you guys know? So let's go over the, let's see what's, what's on tap here. We got
[346.62s -> 354.38s]  Wednesday, I want to do dreams stuff. So when you will probably, so dreams is Wednesday,
[355.34s -> 360.76s]  Thursday, I got something I want to do in there. Alright, here you go. Here's the block
[360.76s -> 367.54s]  out for this week coming up here. So Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and then probably Sunday.
[369.00s -> 372.20s]  That makes the most sense. So you'll probably, we'll do season two of Sam and Max before
[372.20s -> 379.83s]  we started on Friday. Dreams is coming back because I, I want to show you some things
[379.83s -> 388.07s]  that I've made. So like, hopefully I can get some shit to see. And if anybody else has made
[388.07s -> 391.67s]  anything, if you haven't, if nobody's done anything, then whatever. I, you're not expected
[391.67s -> 409.56s]  to. Alright, here we go. Now the question is, will this work? Will you work? Is progression
[409.56s -> 424.71s]  functioning? Cause I really want to see what's available in the game. Okay, it does. Thank
[424.71s -> 433.56s]  God. Good. So let's, let's test this theory. I'm going to search for a battle Royale.
[433.56s -> 444.36s]  I gotta remember how to play. Don't do BR, please. Look how quick that was. That was in
[444.36s -> 455.27s]  seconds. He's just, he's turning into a normie streamer. No, no, I just wanted, I just wanted
[455.27s -> 466.09s]  to see. Yeah, last time this barely worked. Alright, I remember and this is the stab.
[467.13s -> 484.57s]  This is the feign. Oh, I forgot you can kick. You can kick. What's kick? What is kick?
[485.70s -> 500.55s]  Oh, I remapped it. I remapped it. There it is. Fuck. Does this play better than chivalry?
[502.17s -> 509.78s]  Um, I, I have this weird memory of chivalry where I remember playing it a lot, but I kind
[509.78s -> 517.46s]  of don't. I feel like I'm having more fun in this game than I did in chivalry. Like I
[517.46s -> 522.94s]  don't remember like really that much about chivalry. It's been too long. Alright, last
[522.94s -> 531.06s]  time I did this, there was like 10 people in each one of these. Rock and a bandage. Oh
[531.06s -> 543.85s]  god, I got a rock. Okay. Is that what all that was in there? Five ammo. I need to move. I'm like,
[543.85s -> 549.22s]  I'm freezing. There's a chest right there. There's like two chests. God damn it. I hope
[549.22s -> 559.56s]  they didn't. I'm surrounded by chests. Alright, I got a falchion. There's a, uh,
[561.37s -> 568.22s]  bear trap. I'm just gonna put it down like right next to the chest and I need a
[568.22s -> 577.77s]  shield or something. Shield. Okay. What is this? Light chest. Okay, it's on.
[580.50s -> 587.38s]  Ah! My, oh my god, what the fuck? That hurt so bad. I don't, that scared the shit out of me.
[597.16s -> 602.84s]  Why did that just scare me so much? I'm out of here. We're not doing Battle Royale.
[611.50s -> 617.08s]  Frontline. I'm just gonna do matchmaking. Okay, it's time for season two episode one
[617.72s -> 641.86s]  of Sam and Max. Finally. Come on, give me a server here. Come on. I'm trying to get
[641.86s -> 652.60s]  in your game. Come on, Battle Royale took like 10 seconds and the other
[653.32s -> 661.08s]  fun game mode is not gonna take. Come on. Maybe I should try a different region
[664.90s -> 675.45s]  or just go right in the browser. Uh, any game mode is fine. There are a shitload of these
[675.45s -> 688.81s]  servers. 39 out of 48. Oh goodness. This is gonna be a mess. There are 800,000 people
[688.81s -> 697.00s]  playing this right now. Are you kidding me? There are 800,000 people playing this?
[700.84s -> 714.81s]  That's insane. Let's just get in a game. It's 30,000. Oh, I was gonna say that's more than,
[714.81s -> 727.75s]  that's more than like Dota 2. This guy's so dead. I'm the one that get hit by that.
[727.75s -> 743.06s]  Really? Yeah! Oh shit, I thought he was red. Oh boy, too many people.
[749.21s -> 767.54s]  Do-O-Mega-Lol-Ota. Fucking Omega-Lol. Why do I find that so funny?
[769.85s -> 790.26s]  Yeah, I chopped off his arm, mate. All right, here we go. How do I, here we go. I want to throw it at
[790.26s -> 809.27s]  him. Watch out, watch out, watch out. I didn't mean to. I didn't. I promise. Damn it. I'm going
[809.27s -> 831.72s]  for a stab. Shit. Damn it. Oh, I stepped in the fucking fire. Spawn here. I gotta do more faking.
[831.72s -> 836.71s]  I like the fake into the stab. So you go like, I'm gonna stab. That works a lot. That's
[836.71s -> 852.49s]  really, really hard to defend against that. I just want to unlock a new weapon. All right,
[852.49s -> 862.22s]  here we go. Up here. Oh, fucking bear trap. I was so tunnel-visioned into trying to hit this guy.
[873.72s -> 909.50s]  Shit. Damn it. Professional gamer. Well, not really. Oh, that's way too many. This is bad.
[909.50s -> 918.46s]  Really? That didn't hit him. Who even killed me? I don't even know what happened to me.
[918.46s -> 938.26s]  Let me change classes. How do I change classes? It was me. Oh, that was the last stand. Right,
[938.26s -> 953.03s]  right, right. You're right. Really? Really? What was that for? Now I have 50% of my health gone.
[953.03s -> 976.41s]  He's just waiting for me to land. Watch out for this dude. He blocked it. Someone's gonna drop
[976.41s -> 999.78s]  down here. Come on. Thank you. Watch out for the fire. No, that's not a guy. He looked blue.
[999.78s -> 1030.01s]  His left side is blue. He's like two-faced. I didn't think he was gonna go straight into me.
[1030.01s -> 1036.57s]  If I don't sprint, I'll regenerate HP. Good to know. Thank you. Heal by walking,
[1036.57s -> 1055.43s]  not by sprinting. LOL. Idiot. All right, let's make something happen here.
[1055.43s -> 1072.28s]  How did that guy block that from behind? How? I don't believe it. Nope.
[1093.98s -> 1099.27s]  Okay, don't sprint and just stand here and heal. That is so fucking funny.
[1099.27s -> 1104.70s]  This game is, I love this game. All right, I got him right in the head.
[1104.70s -> 1128.74s]  He's behind me. Somebody behind? Oh, God. What? This guy didn't even do the tutorial.
[1128.98s -> 1134.42s]  What? It's really annoying when these streamers just jump into a game and they just like,
[1135.62s -> 1138.66s]  they just play and they don't even do the tutorial and they talk about like,
[1138.66s -> 1143.22s]  what the fuck? What killed me? It's like you didn't stop and heal. I don't know what
[1143.22s -> 1146.74s]  we're talking about, but this game is like a fucking problem with the game. It's like you
[1146.74s -> 1151.40s]  have to press Q to feign he's not doing that. These fucking streamers. You know what I'm
[1151.40s -> 1189.16s]  saying? Nope. You were taunting. Let's see it. Clubbed. I'm going way too far up here.
[1189.16s -> 1227.02s]  I got to slow down. Getting too zealous. Whoa. What? That's okay. I died so fast and I spawned
[1227.02s -> 1236.76s]  so fast. I just saw myself dead on the ground. We lost. Oh well. I'm not in the last place. Yes,
[1236.76s -> 1245.88s]  I am. I thought I came in late. Come on. I'm not very good, but I still have fun.
[1256.94s -> 1265.40s]  Last place. That's what losers say. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1265.40s -> 1284.54s]  You can't have fun while playing games. Don't you know that's the worst thing ever.
[1284.54s -> 1302.66s]  Okay. Let's go with. I don't know. Maybe. Mm. Raiders. I like Raiders. It's fun.
[1302.66s -> 1307.29s]  You shouldn't be laughing. This is your job. It's my job to be really good at video games.
[1307.29s -> 1325.82s]  Come on. All right. I'm ready. I hate it when Jerma has fun. Why? Do you want me to be mad
[1325.82s -> 1329.02s]  and talk about like, I'm not just, I'm just fucking not even fun. Like this is like seriously
[1329.02s -> 1332.14s]  like fucking not even fun. It's like too hard and stupid. It's like everyone's too good at
[1332.14s -> 1334.46s]  the game and I fucking like it. It's like I died. We played against people that had been
[1334.46s -> 1338.54s]  playing for like 50 hours today. It's like not even fun. You want me to do that? No,
[1338.54s -> 1354.17s]  I'm not going to do that. I'm going to have fun. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This guy in the
[1354.17s -> 1362.68s]  corner here. I'm going to go overhead like that. Holy shit. That guy killed everybody.
[1365.35s -> 1375.74s]  Easy with that. Don't come in too hot here. Somebody behind me. Ah, shit. You have to be
[1375.74s -> 1416.49s]  monotone and serious. Fine. That what you want. Here we go. Oh, fuck. I'm laughing.
[1416.49s -> 1433.38s]  I'm not supposed to be doing that. Hey, why is do some of you do this to me? That's not
[1433.38s -> 1437.94s]  nice. Oh, that's a, that was a legit misclick. Okay. All right. No, no, no. That's okay.
[1437.94s -> 1471.38s]  That's fine. Fuck. Oh, I'm getting so outplayed. Fuck. Died to stick. Well,
[1471.38s -> 1486.22s]  there were four of them over there. Oh God. That's the one thing I didn't like
[1486.22s -> 1513.93s]  about crossbows. They take too long to reload. That's the one thing I don't like.
[1513.93s -> 1528.55s]  What? What happened to my weapon? You don't even know who's here. Somebody's
[1528.55s -> 1543.34s]  coming behind you. Good job. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Chat's going to yell at me. Where's my,
[1543.34s -> 1558.79s]  where's my health? There we go. Hey, what just hurt me? Did I get sniped? Don't,
[1558.79s -> 1585.29s]  I'm trying to heal the fuck out of here. I would have had more health. Too many. Really?
[1585.29s -> 1616.70s]  That was a weird arc there. Damn it. Attention. Horses in the stables. Red team OP. The blue,
[1616.70s -> 1620.78s]  it's quite funny. The blue team generally team kill more due to people mistaking them for
[1620.78s -> 1632.82s]  red players when they are low health because they're blood. That's so funny. I've definitely
[1632.82s -> 1663.35s]  been guilty of that at least five to ten times. What are you doing? What? What are you doing?
[1663.35s -> 1675.43s]  That guy just ran into the wall and died, I think. He put up the wall and the guy like
[1675.43s -> 1708.10s]  bugs-bunnied into it. That didn't hit him. Watch it. No, dude. Shit. You can't hear the game. What?
[1708.10s -> 1729.45s]  No, dude. It's really quiet. Is it? Is that better? It should be. Uh oh. Getting a little
[1729.45s -> 1752.07s]  bit of frame dropage here. The guy playing the harmonica or whatever it was just got
[1752.07s -> 1775.40s]  crushed. I get too distracted by the funny things on screen. Let's go. Got the roof.
[1782.47s -> 1790.98s]  All right. Makes that guy swing again. This is too confusing. I'm going the other way.
[1802.76s -> 1806.76s]  What? Hold on. I hit that guy twice in the back and he's still alive?
[1821.05s -> 1827.64s]  Frame rate. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, he's got that perk, right. Okay.
[1838.73s -> 1860.98s]  Fuck. Nope. No way. Get those bastards. Enemy is capturing the stables. Not good.
[1862.42s -> 1882.06s]  All right. I'm gonna go shirtless guy in here. Ready? Puck. Okay. I'm in the middle of everybody
[1882.06s -> 1888.76s]  now. They both did the same thing. I'm trying to go around the corner and like hit him in the
[1888.76s -> 1897.03s]  face. All right. I was doing okay. It wasn't like the top five and I'm dropping down.
[1897.67s -> 1931.21s]  Let me get another couple kills here. Minus 67. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna wrap around. Watch this.
[1931.21s -> 1935.29s]  Watch, watch, watch, watch, watch, watch this strategy. Never mind. There was no. Never
[1935.29s -> 1943.19s]  mind. Never mind. I was gonna wrap around that guy but he backed up too much. I thought
[1943.19s -> 1976.68s]  they're gonna fight in the tunnel together. Ooh. Oof. Should I? No. Bad idea. Hey, I'm just
[1976.68s -> 1992.10s]  trying to heal. Wait, was I blocking? I think I was blocking the whole staircase up here.
[2000.57s -> 2008.01s]  Got it. Somebody ran all the way over there. This guy doesn't know.
[2008.74s -> 2010.42s]  Stay out of his peripheral. I'm gonna hit him right in the head.
[2019.34s -> 2031.40s]  Damn it. Capture it. All right. Watch out for those spikes. Guy on the, on the, on the
[2031.40s -> 2051.02s]  treachery belt. Whatever. The trebuchet. It's our trebuchet now. Oh yeah. Now we got a
[2051.02s -> 2071.77s]  string. Now we got a string. Fire. Horse. Horse. Give me the horse. What? What happened?
[2077.24s -> 2110.54s]  Because it was in the fire? Oh. The horse died to fire and then stumbled on me. Did
[2110.54s -> 2134.30s]  that guy fall down? Is that a teammate? No. Damn it. Ooh. He went all the way around.
[2167.34s -> 2169.74s]  I know what you're talking about now when you say that they might, that they look
[2169.74s -> 2179.94s]  like they're red. Everybody I try to hit. What are they? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold
[2179.94s -> 2189.00s]  on. Hold on. Hold on. I mean like seriously. What? He just, it's like he's shooting rocks
[2189.08s -> 2205.32s]  over. I gotta go visit this guy. I have to get over there. Come on. That was right in
[2205.32s -> 2231.78s]  the back of his head. I took, that was clean on the nape of his neck. Ooh. He caught that
[2231.78s -> 2270.54s]  one with his teeth. Ooh. Hey. Is that all you got mates? Oh, but it is a take to take me
[2270.54s -> 2295.90s]  down. Seven. How many? Eight. Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click,
[2295.90s -> 2298.38s]  click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[2301.24s -> 2343.83s]  Really? Level two. I should be much higher than that. Come on. Oh. All right. I gotta
[2343.83s -> 2354.78s]  get the trebuchet guy again. This time I gotta take his head clean off. Oh God. Oh God.
[2359.35s -> 2370.62s]  Why are you standing there still? No, I can't play like this. He was alive.
[2375.86s -> 2386.90s]  Uh, he was probably rage typing. Definitely. Fucking idiot. Why do I have to get out of
[2386.90s -> 2394.41s]  always the losing team? Seriously? Like I have to just stop team killing. Oh my God.
[2395.05s -> 2411.10s]  I mean, okay. Let me be fair. If you were riding in on a stallion and you were going
[2411.10s -> 2415.93s]  in for the kill and there was a free target for me just standing there and some dude just
[2415.93s -> 2433.37s]  swung and cut your horse down and you fell off. What? I can't swing it here.
[2444.54s -> 2458.02s]  That guy's so relentless. I couldn't fight him in there. Oh, wait. Right. You're right.
[2458.02s -> 2478.62s]  Right. Right. Okay. I can hold the, I can hold it in a different way. Can I? Right. Come
[2478.62s -> 2504.89s]  on. Right in the fucking head. Right in the fucking head. Oh, crossbow. The horse is OP.
[2504.89s -> 2519.42s]  Um, I, I, maybe I'm just not experienced in the game, but it's hard to control. Am I helping?
[2520.44s -> 2537.83s]  No, not really. Oh yeah. Destroying these guys right now. This one's running. Please
[2537.83s -> 2555.16s]  close the door. All right. Let's all, let's get in there. This is not, we, nobody can move.
[2559.53s -> 2567.82s]  No, no. Stop. Open the door. What have you done? I'm just gonna stop moving.
[2576.25s -> 2598.31s]  Ah, ah. Oh shit. Guys. I got it. It's okay. Don't worry. Oh fuck. Close it. Close the door.
[2598.95s -> 2620.06s]  Close the door. Close the door. What's he throwing in here? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[2620.06s -> 2640.84s]  No, no. Where am I? Oh shit. Oh my God. What? Oh fuck God. I was just in Super Mario
[2640.84s -> 2649.74s]  World. How did I not get hit and how did I not hit anybody? The never-ending Bowser
[2649.74s -> 2664.36s]  staircase. Can I open the gate? Nobody else fighting up here? Holy shit. Where did you come
[2664.36s -> 2675.74s]  from? He just did, did you see what he did with his hands? He just like changed hands.
[2676.38s -> 2698.33s]  He like switched hands. That was weird. That was bad. We can't just stuff in here like this.
[2702.28s -> 2731.51s]  Oh yeah. I know about Q. I use it sometimes. I know about you can, you do stab into faint
[2731.51s -> 2738.65s]  there. You can do a swing into a stab. You can Q. You can kick. You can kick into a kick.
[2738.65s -> 2749.66s]  You can swing into a swing. Dude, if you just had not walked right there, you walked right
[2749.66s -> 2763.16s]  in front of it, I could have healed. I did the tutorial last time, but it didn't count
[2763.16s -> 2768.79s]  because the servers were down. So I would just be doing the tutorial for money. But I don't know
[2768.79s -> 2771.83s]  if you guys want to see, I could do that off stream, you know, and we really want to do
[2771.83s -> 2778.58s]  that right now. I don't even know what's going on, right? I guess it is worth it for money.
[2778.58s -> 2801.21s]  How did he die? How many more? One guy. Oh god damn it. I've seen too many episodes of TV.
[2801.85s -> 2810.42s]  Doesn't work like that. The guy on the horse always wins. I was like waiting for and prepared
[2810.42s -> 2831.78s]  to strike him down. I've seen too many fucking episodes of TV. Okay. I've played too many
[2831.78s -> 2841.96s]  video games. I've seen too much TV. See you later. Oh, that would have been a fucking
[2841.96s -> 2868.70s]  champ moment if you ask me. How much gold? 600 gold. Finally leveling up and getting
[2868.70s -> 2875.05s]  money for playing. Nice. That wasn't the last place. That was right there in the middle.
[2877.88s -> 2895.70s]  All right, one more game and then we're gonna go spend some money. 600,
[2895.70s -> 2904.14s]  that's a lot of medieval money. Yeah, it is. This time we're gonna go,
[2907.69s -> 2918.73s]  I'll go protector this time. Why not? We have the smoke bombs, the mace, the shield.
[2919.37s -> 2926.22s]  Can two people get on the horse? That'd be funny if you could.
[2929.61s -> 2943.83s]  Archer on horseback. Let's see how this plays out. Are we gonna go? You gotta lead the charge.
[2944.39s -> 2982.12s]  Okay, capturing. Okay, on to the camp, wherever this is. All right, watch out. Nice work. Watch
[2982.12s -> 2997.61s]  out behind you. Did that hit me? I think I got hit. No. I took it down right when he started
[2997.61s -> 3006.15s]  swinging. Derma shield spam. I'm a protector. I'm supposed to get in front and put the
[3006.15s -> 3019.32s]  shield out. Can I heal with this character too if I don't move? Yes. So it's only, it happens no
[3019.32s -> 3042.34s]  matter what. Yeah, guys. That guy's, whoo. Oh, a guy from firefight with a fucking sword.
[3042.34s -> 3069.83s]  God damn it. Press end. What? Why is he still on the horse? We got three people smashing
[3069.83s -> 3116.97s]  him. Is that him again? No, that's our horse guy. That didn't hit him? Archer is so hard.
[3116.97s -> 3143.48s]  If you hit it, it's hard though. Oh fuck. No, no, no, no, no. 70 damage is pretty hard. That's
[3143.48s -> 3154.47s]  only two shots to kill somebody in the head. What is a headshot? Is it dead? It's a dead shot
[3154.47s -> 3214.71s]  is what that is. Damn. Really? I was standing still. God fuck. The little arrows. Like, okay.
[3216.58s -> 3255.10s]  I guess I got him. Ooh, the Pankai is just out to get you. Well, whatever. Let them come.
[3255.10s -> 3275.14s]  We just got destroyed. Vote scramble. I feel like I would really love that bow.
[3277.48s -> 3288.79s]  Uh, where have we not gone? This one's cool. Don't go in the bedroom. Oh, okay. Oh,
[3288.79s -> 3303.74s]  okay. Right, right, right. Along to the game has hats? I don't think that'll take very long.
[3303.74s -> 3327.40s]  All right, we're gonna stick with it. What are the breaks?
[3341.98s -> 3353.70s]  Is he chasing me? He's chasing me, isn't he? All right, somebody else take this. I don't want
[3353.70s -> 3387.91s]  it. Yeah, watch out. Oh, I can see them. Is that a balloon? That's a balloon. I'm helping.
[3387.91s -> 3413.50s]  I'm helping. I helped. Oh, that went right by his head. Hello? Let's go. Shit, I had it.
[3413.50s -> 3428.50s]  Where's this dude? Hey, what are they? Oh, this guy's right in the head. One,
[3428.50s -> 3441.91s]  two, three. Oh, no. He knows. He knows what I'm trying to do. That guy just killed himself.
[3441.91s -> 3477.78s]  Come on. Thank you for the help. I appreciate it. I'm coming out. Why did that not run him
[3477.78s -> 3490.62s]  over at least? I blocked it. Oh, where is he? I think I'm gonna hold it up like it's a sign.
[3490.62s -> 3513.00s]  He's gonna get hit in the face. I remember my bow. He knocked my bow out of my hands.
[3516.76s -> 3526.78s]  Why is he? I didn't do that. I didn't do it. He got R1'd from above.
[3534.47s -> 3542.39s]  Here he's running. He's running. Oh, didn't get away this time. Sorry, mates.
[3543.35s -> 3580.98s]  Oh, I blocked it. This is bad. I gotta get out of this. Uh-oh. Oh, I held up. I made it.
[3580.98s -> 3608.84s]  I made it. I finally did it. Even for five seconds, I did it. I gotta get closer.
[3613.35s -> 3633.19s]  Damn it. That guy distracted me. Wow. Come on. Just stand up there. People throwing
[3633.19s -> 3666.02s]  pans at him. That guy got a frying pan at him. Oh, shit. No. That guy has a lot of pans.
[3666.66s -> 3685.93s]  Oh, I thought he was gonna step back. All right. This guy's done. Headshot. Three, two, one. He
[3685.93s -> 3696.82s]  jumped. Watch this guy right here. This guy is just like fucking taunting. Oh, no. That guy was
[3696.82s -> 3718.68s]  so dead. Speaking of dead guys. Yeah, speaking of the guys that are dead. Hey, trying to take
[3718.68s -> 3740.68s]  out my fucking... He blocked that point blank. He's still up there. Oh, he's still there.
[3743.86s -> 3752.81s]  Oh, is he still... Are these even going? What's the drop like here? Am I shooting too low?
[3759.46s -> 3782.78s]  Get the fuck at it. Give me this thing. Oh, shit. I can throw it. All right. New plan. I'm going
[3782.78s -> 3804.65s]  to... Let's go with this guy. We got short sword, fists. All right. Let's make something
[3804.65s -> 3837.06s]  happen. Damn it. I'm so sorry. The guy with the hammer is seriously freaking me the fuck
[3837.06s -> 3845.62s]  out every time. Oh, you can throw it. Okay. Why was that just a weird like,
[3845.62s -> 3873.05s]  wiffle ball throw? Oh, that was a full baseball swing to his face. It's another one. Oh,
[3873.05s -> 3918.63s]  that's another one. Oh, who's doing that? Nice block. Oh, come on. Come on.
[3922.36s -> 3952.22s]  Oh, it's going crazy. Oh, my God. He's gonna die. He's gonna die. He's gonna die.
[3952.30s -> 3967.61s]  He's gonna die. Did he die? Why did he not... The countdown. Wait, how come that's his
[3967.61s -> 3987.64s]  territory? Oh, bullshit. I was waiting for him to have the four or five seconds countdown.
[3987.64s -> 4010.76s]  Nice. Oops. I hit like four people on my team. I was like a hundred miles away.
[4012.89s -> 4020.18s]  I reached across the Atlantic Ocean to hit that guy. They're killing their own teammates.
[4021.74s -> 4056.87s]  Oh, what are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Watch out. Oops. Oh, the stupid catapult
[4056.87s -> 4067.05s]  just hit me right in the head. Dude, that... I want to see a replay of that. The dude with the
[4067.05s -> 4087.86s]  two pins. I came across. My sword was like 40 feet long. He blocked it. Nice. Come on.
[4087.86s -> 4102.82s]  I'll take the bolt on. Let's see. I'll take your fucking all on at once. I'll take your
[4102.82s -> 4140.70s]  fucking all on. I need to heal. Heal. Heal. Heals. Somebody heal? Damn. What do I need?
[4140.70s -> 4164.06s]  I need some more assists. I'm gonna go around the corner here. Watch this. One, two. Yes.
[4166.09s -> 4175.30s]  Uh-oh. It's pan guy. This guy with the pants. Seriously. Every time.
[4179.70s -> 4182.98s]  Oh, everyone is getting clubbed by my weapon.
[4183.78s -> 4202.07s]  Uh-oh. Damn it. Three pans and no armor. He just runs up and I end up just clothes lining
[4202.07s -> 4217.54s]  him every time. Sorry. I'm too busy fucking paying attention to other things in my mind.
[4219.66s -> 4230.07s]  You piece of trash. Stop killing the guys with the loots? What? Why?
[4230.87s -> 4253.48s]  Is that like a sandwich heavy or something? How is that not... Holy shit. That guy got hit
[4253.48s -> 4262.82s]  by five weapons. It's too hard to pay attention to some of this shit, man. Seriously. Like,
[4262.82s -> 4271.35s]  I need... I gotta focus again like I just was. I gotta go out on top here. Well, no. I'm not
[4271.35s -> 4300.18s]  stop playing, but... I was so focused. Now I'm just laughing. No, that didn't block. Damn it.
[4303.22s -> 4312.34s]  No. I'm so pumped right now. I gotta be in first. How much time is left?
[4312.42s -> 4334.15s]  Just presented my crotch to him. Guys down here. I'm gonna wrap around and see if I can poke.
[4339.08s -> 4350.97s]  Damn it. A little too high. I still don't have that down. Again, this guy again. The guy with
[4350.97s -> 4381.64s]  the pants. Come on. Kill him. Here he is again. The guy with the pants. Ooh, good blocks. Give me
[4381.64s -> 4397.72s]  it. Give it to me. Oh, fuck. I was gonna throw it at him. That guy is just a free...
[4398.28s -> 4447.29s]  guy is a free kill. There he is. Oh, my shit. Come on. Throw it. Throw it at me. Oh.
[4470.84s -> 4484.47s]  I was just desperately trying to kill this guy. Oh, right in the back of the head.
[4484.47s -> 4514.52s]  Damn. 35, 35, 14, 13, 10, 7. That would have been cool, wouldn't it? One day. One day
[4514.52s -> 4541.93s]  I'll get it. Ow. Is he dead? Oh, shit. I'm getting so into this. Did you tell us
[4541.93s -> 4565.02s]  tonight's powerball numbers? 8, 14, 77, 6, 2, 2. I guess. Holy shit. That guy hit me right in the
[4565.02s -> 4581.32s]  head. Oh, boy. Oh, no. I think I'm gonna lose my first place here. Come on. I gotta get,
[4581.32s -> 4619.80s]  like, a couple more kills right here. Ow! What the fuck? I probably could have done it if I
[4619.80s -> 4629.82s]  wasn't being a dickhead. Oh, I really could have done that, too. If I wasn't being such a
[4629.82s -> 4640.39s]  dumbass, I probably would have gotten another kill or two. All right, I'll make a character now.
[4640.39s -> 4655.58s]  Let's see what weapons I can unlock. All right. Armory. So, let's go down here.
[4658.17s -> 4668.34s]  What am I? What is this? Ain't gonna work. Okay, so, Archer's Camp Wanderer's Hood. Can't do
[4668.34s -> 4687.34s]  that yet. None of these. Chain Coif. No, it's too much money. Root Smokebomb Cleaver Primary.
[4687.34s -> 4702.76s]  Okay. A little Hand Axe. I feel like I'd like that. A War Hammer. Oh, why? Yeah, I think so.
[4703.98s -> 4715.00s]  War Hammer is so cool. I need to be level four for these. I am level four. Oh, four points.
[4715.00s -> 4727.05s]  I see. Well, let's get rid of this shit. Okay. I want to do- I think I want to do War Hammer.
[4730.18s -> 4749.21s]  Let's try War Hammer. War Hammer and Targe is not bad. Greatsword.
[4755.35s -> 4767.37s]  Maul. Execution of Sword. Evening Star. Well, I'm gonna keep the rock. I think War Hammer,
[4767.37s -> 4779.75s]  Targe will be all right. Utility Head? Popular Head and Gothic Head. Holy shit. Okay, that's
[4779.75s -> 4791.14s]  cool. Shaft. Hybrid Handle. Bar Handle. Let this drop a hybrid handle. Is it just cosmetic
[4791.14s -> 4808.38s]  or does it do anything? I mean, I like that look better than this. Okay, can I upgrade the rock?
[4809.02s -> 4820.87s]  What about Chest Mail? Torso Chain Mail. That's only 480 bucks. Oh, shit. Well,
[4820.87s -> 4830.36s]  that's okay. I can put this on. Shoulders. Basic Shoulders is 300. Yeah, put them on.
[4831.93s -> 4840.58s]  Okay. Arms. Anything for free? What do we got for perks? Fist damage? No.
[4843.00s -> 4846.68s]  Melee damage against structures increased. Repair effectiveness. Bloodlust. Full health on
[4846.68s -> 4854.49s]  melee kills. I mean, it's just- why would you not have that on? Passive. That's all I can do.
[4856.31s -> 4874.74s]  Wow, your character looks good. Well, give me a break. He's got a little while. Okay.
[4874.74s -> 4881.67s]  All right, I think that's good. I'm gonna try the War Hammer. We have to keep playing
[4881.67s -> 4892.89s]  to unlock cool stuff. All right, back in it. Please put on a helmet. No, we don't need pants.
[4893.61s -> 4902.65s]  Not yet. All right, this is official. Five out of six. Six out of 48. Los Angeles. Mountain
[4902.65s -> 4908.79s]  Peak. This is frontline again. Team Deathmatch. Let's see, we did a lot. We'll do Deathmatch.
[4908.79s -> 4914.57s]  We'll just do standard Deathmatch. Well, maybe not. I do like the frontline maps. So
[4914.57s -> 4928.04s]  much fun. I'm going back in. Do I not want to show the server? It's all right. I mean,
[4928.04s -> 4932.04s]  at this point, it really wouldn't be that hard for someone to find the server I'm in.
[4932.92s -> 4945.59s]  You know, it wouldn't take very long. Okay, so this is the War Hammer. What's it swing like?
[4948.94s -> 4954.76s]  Cool. Is there another way to hold it? I can swing it around the other way. I can do the
[4954.76s -> 4988.98s]  claw of the hammer. I wonder what the difference would be here. God damn it! I forgot,
[4988.98s -> 5009.06s]  because I was on the other team for so long. You just crit your teammate from behind.
[5009.62s -> 5040.70s]  I know. I know it's fucking bad. Damn it, that didn't hit. Yeah, assuming the blunt is probably
[5040.70s -> 5092.02s]  for better for heavy, right? All right, whatever. Boink! Oh shit. Damn. Oh god. All right,
[5092.02s -> 5094.98s]  so I had the hammer switched the other way. Seems like he had light armor on. I was only
[5094.98s -> 5111.67s]  doing 20 damage. Do I have that backwards? Nobody's playing the objective. The spike
[5111.67s -> 5130.71s]  should be for armor. Yeah, I guess. I had it the other way around. Too many. Yeah,
[5130.71s -> 5134.81s]  claw to pierce, hammer to bludgeon. Yeah. I don't know why I thought the spike was
[5134.81s -> 5146.30s]  going to do more damage to it. I got peasant armor. This is a really, really fun game.
[5148.41s -> 5161.38s]  It just, it's got, it hits all the notes. I can see you. Holy shit, your whole team's here.
[5179.24s -> 5184.15s]  Here. I killed him with the rock. It's just not, I'm going to go the other way.
[5188.01s -> 5220.20s]  Heal. Come on. Yeah. Okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Is that it? We got
[5220.20s -> 5245.05s]  two more, right? Yeah, right in the face. There's a guy behind. Is this a bad guy?
[5245.69s -> 5293.83s]  It is. What? We lost. I must've joined that one in the very end, huh? Nobody played the
[5293.83s -> 5300.92s]  objective. Yeah. You have to play the objective on the objective map. That's right. It's not just
[5300.92s -> 5326.54s]  TDM. Oh, I like this map. Middle fighting in Warsong Gulch. That really is what it reminds me
[5326.54s -> 5357.18s]  of. I don't want to get like across the mob. Rock kill. Can I reach? I don't think I can
[5357.18s -> 5375.74s]  reach. You can't reach it. Oh, damn it. Oh, well. Oh God. Oh God. I thought that guy was just
[5375.74s -> 5399.35s]  swinging over and over again. I thought he was going to faint. One of them. Here we go. This
[5399.35s -> 5433.54s]  is not good. Too many of you. Come on. Pierce that armor. Kick them off. God damn it. There's
[5433.54s -> 5458.74s]  too many of you. I can't. Back it up. Use rock. 36. I feel like this is the wrong side
[5458.74s -> 5472.82s]  again. It's got to be... Jesus. All right. Desperate times, guy. That's not working out.
[5472.82s -> 5510.30s]  I got to go with the... back to Brigand. I'm kind of getting rolled here. Who's playing the piano?
[5510.94s -> 5525.29s]  What? What is going on? What's this music? I thought that was a little loot.
[5525.29s -> 5546.10s]  Not like a band in a box. All right. He's almost dead. I thought there was a guy right
[5546.10s -> 5569.24s]  here. There he is. Oh no. No. They don't even see me. Oh, come on. Oh, the guy comes
[5569.24s -> 5592.09s]  at a fucking stage left with a horse. This is bad. This is bad. Yeah. We just got steamrolled.
[5592.09s -> 5610.82s]  Play the objective. It's hard to play the objective when the other team
[5611.77s -> 5628.39s]  kills all of your team and they're all still alive. You can't really walk out the door.
[5628.39s -> 5643.96s]  Red always gets rolled on that map, do they? No. I'm going to get auto-picked.
[5643.96s -> 5647.64s]  Just TK the loot guy. I can't do that. People will be mad at me.
[5648.44s -> 5670.76s]  I have no idea what I'm doing on here, but I'm going to do it. Is there a way I can
[5670.76s -> 5680.20s]  actually aim the sword? Oh my God. Oh, that's my first experience trying that.
[5680.20s -> 5687.70s]  I think he took my head off. Oh, he's using the lance. That's why.
[5695.93s -> 5700.25s]  Killed off by stage left by horse. No, I mean, I saw where he was going.
[5701.75s -> 5705.99s]  He killed me. All right. Let's go. Time to turn it back on.
[5721.66s -> 5740.55s]  Oh, come on. What the fucking horse. Stop. I need to play as the loot man.
[5741.35s -> 5760.66s]  No, I don't like loot man. You just do this and like dance. Oh God, here he comes. I smelled him.
[5774.02s -> 5778.42s]  Dude, can we just have the door fucking open? Does this have to keep going like this?
[5789.90s -> 5792.94s]  No one has been able to take that guy off the horse. He's been running around in a circle
[5792.94s -> 5815.98s]  for like eight minutes. I didn't do it. You understand, that wasn't me. I may have been
[5815.98s -> 5848.23s]  thinking it, but I didn't do it. I'm so concerned about everybody. There's somebody behind me too.
[5848.23s -> 5856.89s]  Look at how bad we're going to be. Look at the guy on the other team. We're going to be so bad
[5856.89s -> 5880.76s]  because that guy over there has 10 kills. One guy. Smoking is all. I just got instantly killed.
[5880.76s -> 5884.78s]  All right. I got to stop looking at the guy standing still with the loots.
[5886.79s -> 5893.29s]  They're distracting me. I'm not even looking at him. I'm going to, I'm facing the camera
[5893.29s -> 5953.90s]  this way. Damn. I thought I was going to walk into it. Damn it. Fuck. No. Look at the kill feed.
[5956.78s -> 5959.74s]  All right. Give me a break. Come on. Look at this shit.
[5976.86s -> 5983.86s]  I can't. I can't. I can't. Why is he going in a circle like this?
[5984.18s -> 6032.95s]  Oh my God. Oh, my face is itchy. No. All I can hear is the music. Oh my God.
[6033.59s -> 6046.02s]  I got to change it up for something, man. I can't even do anything. There's a dude on the team
[6046.02s -> 6067.70s]  with 34 kills. Somebody sign that guy up. Oh my God. They were just everywhere. It's almost
[6067.70s -> 6076.39s]  like they have a double spawn rate. Are they spawning inside of this building? I'm going to
[6076.39s -> 6084.31s]  get him when he comes around. Watch this. I'm ready for him. I told you. I ripped him out of
[6084.31s -> 6115.91s]  this fucking dimension. Who the hell is behind me? Get vehicle damage. Finally. Maybe I'll do
[6115.91s -> 6135.74s]  something with the bow. Got to get on the objective though. That went right through his
[6135.74s -> 6168.18s]  body. Stay on the cleaver. All right. I'm on. I'm on again. I'm turned on again.
[6168.66s -> 6250.01s]  Oh, that's not hitting him. Oh, thanks for the shield. Can I get anybody from back here?
[6250.01s -> 6295.29s]  Probably not. There's a guy over here. No, I got a guy in the back. Do I win the prize?
[6295.29s -> 6323.67s]  Is there? Will you leave me the fuck alone? Kill him. Please. I'm dead. All right. I guess
[6323.67s -> 6342.60s]  I'm going to go with like Raider for a while. There's not somebody back here, right? There
[6342.60s -> 6395.29s]  is somebody back here. Got him. I helped. All right. Heal. I took his head off. We did it. Oh,
[6395.29s -> 6405.62s]  I thought I could get him down before he could. You really want that, don't you?
[6406.18s -> 6429.32s]  You really want to get that, don't you? You want it so bad you can taste it. Oh,
[6429.32s -> 6443.11s]  I was stuck on top of the horse. I didn't know that little Labo supported this game.
[6443.98s -> 6456.20s]  New to the Nintendo Labo. That was pretty sick. That was perfect. Streamer, look at the chat.
[6458.04s -> 6488.94s]  What? What is it? All right. I'm going right up the middle here. Thanks. There's somebody behind me
[6488.94s -> 6502.87s]  in there. No, I thought, no, it's just a cage. This guy. He finally panned me. He finally found
[6502.87s -> 6560.52s]  me and panned me. He did it. Got it. Oh, I thought. I got it. Vehicle. Oh, my God. He
[6560.52s -> 6590.54s]  actually. Oh, hi again. Did I make my own class? I did make my own class, but I don't
[6590.54s -> 6603.56s]  really have enough money to make a good class yet. I could do the peasant thing. I need more
[6603.56s -> 6609.40s]  armor, I think, if I want to make a class. Because I'm walking around with no pants on.
[6610.04s -> 6621.61s]  I got that. I tapped that guy so many times. There's no way he stays alive from that.
[6623.45s -> 6645.14s]  He's been quadruped. He's got a triple tap. They're surrounding me with pants.
[6650.95s -> 6663.27s]  All right. I'm going to play something else to submit to the pans. I'm going to have to
[6663.27s -> 6703.16s]  become one. I'm going to get some kills here. Get away. All right. We're pushing out. Let's go.
[6703.72s -> 6721.03s]  As a team, we can do it. Why are you over here? What the fuck is this guy doing?
[6738.17s -> 6770.42s]  Loot man gets revenge. I'm going to need one guy over here. Guy on a horse though.
[6770.42s -> 6792.01s]  No, that's our horse. Oh, my God. They're doing like psychological warfare on me.
[6792.73s -> 6826.14s]  No, too slow. I'm going to go back tonight. That guy has 67 fucking kills. All right. New server.
[6861.00s -> 6868.65s]  Thank you. It's not going to do anything. It's going to take 30 seconds for someone to defy
[6868.65s -> 6922.18s]  this fucking server. I like this map though. All right. Fresh start. Let's go. Did that not
[6922.18s -> 6934.38s]  hit? I hit the flag. Ah, fire. All right. Am I going to die? Three, two, one. I'm alive.
[6935.02s -> 7003.75s]  Are you serious? How? He's typing. Typing. Got the guy typing. Sick. Typing destroyed. I don't think
[7003.75s -> 7025.29s]  he was typing that. I think he was typing. Hey guys, I got to go. Can you be faster than me?
[7025.29s -> 7057.98s]  How is he still alive? I was trying to fake that. Let's see. Holy shit. Oh, right in the mouth.
[7057.98s -> 7089.38s]  Why do they always run? Stand and fight. Oops. Whoa, too many. Why are you running?
[7089.38s -> 7118.10s]  Why are you running, dude? Loud as hell. People here. Well. Oh, come on. How?
[7132.92s -> 7138.57s]  That was no horse, was it? I thought that was a meteorite. Kick them. What did they do?
[7144.57s -> 7165.21s]  It was a medieval meteorite. That's far too many. We all just got killed there. Five of us
[7165.21s -> 7198.71s]  just died. Okay. Let's go this way. All right. Move, move, move, move, move, move. We can do
[7198.71s -> 7223.51s]  it. Oh, fire. Good, good. Clear them out. Clear them out. Fuck. There's really nothing I
[7223.51s -> 7259.72s]  could do there. How long did it take? It's all right. Whatever. He's on my team. It's fine.
[7259.72s -> 7300.34s]  I didn't touch. That didn't hit. I didn't connect. That was fucking funny.
[7312.10s -> 7322.55s]  Whoa. Well, that was okay. That's not a good idea. Back to the team. What's happening?
[7324.09s -> 7392.63s]  Oh my God. Well. Yeah, you can ride a horse in this. It's crazy. It's very fun. Damn it. Ah,
[7392.63s -> 7416.65s]  somebody behind me. Fuck. Got killed by Rockman. Probably. You stabbed him in the back.
[7423.82s -> 7431.00s]  Oh, come on. Just aim the thing there and just wait and then press the button.
[7431.80s -> 7469.59s]  You'll kill four people. Just keep loading it up. Yeah, let's do new game mode. And we're gonna,
[7469.59s -> 7475.18s]  we're gonna bring the sample size down here a little bit instead of like 50 person servers.
[7475.74s -> 7500.17s]  Okay. We've got four deathmatch death. We've done all frontline. This TDM.
[7503.56s -> 7524.26s]  Now hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's see what we got for team deathmatch.
[7524.26s -> 7540.50s]  Team deathmatch is fun. Do a dual server. Great screen while I'm picking a server.
[7541.38s -> 7574.70s]  No, let's bring down the player count and do a, let's just do like some TDM. All right.
[7574.70s -> 7590.97s]  Whatever you do, don't press tab. No, it's just enough. Oops.
[7591.85s -> 7594.81s]  I actually didn't mean to press that. I was trying to press Q.
[7594.81s -> 7631.11s]  Fire, fire, fire. Oh, I got hit in the head. Don't touch that dial now. We're just getting
[7631.11s -> 7648.54s]  started. There was just little congregation here of fighters. Well, I didn't want to hit
[7648.54s -> 7703.13s]  anybody in the head accidentally. Easy. Nice. Good job. Really? Damn. Oh, I probably should
[7703.13s -> 7735.45s]  have spun it around on that guy before. That was weird. All right. Here we go. Back in the
[7735.45s -> 7757.56s]  action. I just didn't know which way to look. Left and right. Both my blind spots.
[7757.56s -> 7765.21s]  Okay. This is just TDM. How much does the game get? I think it's 30 bucks.
[7766.39s -> 7771.77s]  25 right now. Maybe something like that. Oh my goodness. They're all over here.
[7771.77s -> 7791.10s]  I got to pick a spot and stay there. I'm just so, I keep trying to change directions.
[7791.10s -> 7823.75s]  This guy's walking. Is this guy role playing? Oh dear. That was a mistake.
[7823.75s -> 7843.40s]  Oh, that was a mistake. Was I enough of a bait for someone to get killed? Can I climb up
[7843.40s -> 7857.32s]  the rocks? I'm just trying to be like the guy that runs in for this guy to stab him in the
[7857.32s -> 7882.17s]  back. We won. I want to play like a full round. I keep joining and like did three
[7882.17s -> 7901.21s]  minutes. It's over. Loot, loot, loot, loot, loot, loot, loot. No, no loot. I'll do my final
[7901.21s -> 7931.19s]  round as a loot. Okay. Ooh, this is fun. I like this one. Oh, packet loss. That's not good.
[7931.75s -> 7959.82s]  All right. Let's go this way. No, that's bad. Let me regen. Oh, no more glass bottles of
[7959.82s -> 8002.54s]  gasoline. Good job. Kick him off. I think he did. I think he kicked him off. Looked like
[8002.54s -> 8013.26s]  it at least. I really, I thought he was going, I thought he was going to get blocked
[8013.26s -> 8019.94s]  by the guy in front of me. Apparently, I just got hit right in the head. I thought that he
[8019.94s -> 8042.68s]  was going after the guy right next to me. Oh, he walked into that. It wasn't my fault.
[8048.39s -> 8102.84s]  I'm trying to kick somebody. Let's do Raider. Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear. Not good.
[8102.84s -> 8121.50s]  It's going to be an extra kick perk. That would be nice. No, that's okay. Not good. Oh
[8121.50s -> 8156.60s]  my god. I'm just going to hang out back here. Let's go short here. No one's running
[8156.60s -> 8182.81s]  through here. Nobody else is going to run through the door, huh? No bad. No bad. How do
[8182.81s -> 8222.44s]  you minus one from team killing? Too many. Wow. I just, I got spun around. I just can't
[8222.44s -> 8256.95s]  get anything going. No. Oh my god. I'm doing so bad right now. I need like a smaller weapon.
[8256.95s -> 8273.54s]  Give me a scoundrel. Green and yellow would be better. That's actually a good idea. He's
[8273.54s -> 8278.92s]  gone this way. I didn't block it. He was doing the same thing waiting for me.
[8297.02s -> 8328.06s]  I just have to play defensively here. Good job. Damn. I didn't think he was going to get that.
[8337.14s -> 8346.57s]  Get him. Somebody get this guy. Oh, this is fucking Superman. We can't kill this one person.
[8347.53s -> 8369.70s]  He's just running around. I got it right in the face. Oh, at least that wasn't at the
[8369.70s -> 8395.54s]  very bottom. You haven't won a single game. Yeah, I'm one of 50 people. Is that really?
[8395.54s -> 8419.69s]  I had like four people play Lutz the whole time. Is that my fault? I can't carry. What?
[8419.69s -> 8428.26s]  You really think that's going to happen? The last game I had three people trying to pan me.
[8429.91s -> 8461.62s]  I'm the variable. Like apparently I am. Watch the sides. Sneak in. Sneak a little bit in.
[8473.83s -> 8483.83s]  Heal. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. I need to heal. This is not a good place to heal in front of everybody.
[8483.83s -> 8516.07s]  In front of- Oh, this guy's just wildly swinging over here. Get him. This guy's- Why?
[8516.07s -> 8579.58s]  I'm a psycho. Oh, right in the head. Come on, right in his face. No. Well, that was
[8579.58s -> 8596.86s]  probably a bad idea. I ran into him and he just over- it's almost too long. And I just
[8596.86s -> 8604.47s]  put my mouth up. I was like, yeah, take a picture of my mouth. He's over here. He just
[8604.47s -> 8621.16s]  hit me right in the mouth. Fuck. I didn't know that many people here. They'll kill each other.
[8621.16s -> 8677.85s]  Good. I need to be behind. We're both just the same thing. Nice. Good work. Oops. Stick
[8677.85s -> 8699.69s]  him. Stick him. Oh. Let's see if I can sneak in my skewer here. I'm trying to hit that
[8699.69s -> 8727.85s]  guy. No. Shit. Guy behind. All right. I'll try to- after this map, I'm going to do a-
[8728.49s -> 8741.29s]  try to find, like, another server. Maybe we'll do some 1v1s, maybe. I don't even know which side
[8741.29s -> 8782.94s]  I am. Okay. Well, I helped. He just got Stooges. I could smell that one all the way, all the way
[8782.94s -> 8803.62s]  over here. I'm going down. Yep. Ah, shit. I got locked up. This game is very squelchy.
[8803.62s -> 8824.50s]  What do you mean squelchy? Squelchy? Damn it. One in front, one behind. Not much you can do.
[8825.14s -> 8835.86s]  Does Jax do games like this or only shooters? Jax does anything that I ask him to,
[8836.42s -> 8845.45s]  as long as he's had enough rest. Usually he's, like, seven months. Seven months of rest.
[8846.09s -> 8879.11s]  Oh, fuck. Jax is just Jerma's competent alter-rego. That's- yeah, that's true.
[8879.11s -> 8893.78s]  All right. Let me get him to, like, a- we'll- we'll do a little bit more. We'll do some
[8893.78s -> 8901.37s]  duels. And are there any official duel servers? Or do I have to find, like, a custom one?
[8901.93s -> 8930.86s]  I don't think there's any official ones. Let's see. All right. We got 1v1.
[8931.50s -> 8959.64s]  I don't want 32 people to go. Duels. US West 1v1s. That looks pretty good. All right.
[8959.64s -> 8977.94s]  1v1s. How does one determine? Do I just pick out an opponent and we go? All right. Guy with
[8977.94s -> 9009.77s]  the t-shirt on. All right. Do I say yes? I think we just- you just fight. Hey, get- no!
[9010.73s -> 9040.52s]  I don't- I can't even, man. I seriously can't get over that. He just kind of ran up and started
[9040.52s -> 9054.70s]  swinging. I guess it's you and me again. Oh, boy. I'm just getting fucking killed by this dude.
[9056.87s -> 9087.16s]  Hey, you! Oh, fuck. That was long. Shit! I was pretty much sure if I connected that.
[9087.16s -> 9097.14s]  Like that? Ah. I don't know what to do here. This is- okay, you and me.
[9097.14s -> 9140.86s]  It's quick. I- I've tried to flourish, but where do I go? Over here? Somebody? I need to
[9140.86s -> 9152.60s]  get back in line. Where's the duel line? Hey, you! I guess we could fight each other. Wait,
[9152.60s -> 9212.22s]  hold on. I gotta- I need to heal first. All right. Me and you. Ooh, good. Ooh. Uh-oh!
[9212.94s -> 9227.40s]  No! I could have pressed two. I forgot I had another sword. Okay, you two fight.
[9227.40s -> 9233.22s]  All right. Let's go Minecraft Steve. That's exactly who this person's playing as. Like,
[9233.22s -> 9250.63s]  this is Minecraft Steve. That's a big swing windup, too. He's dead. I need to heal.
[9251.27s -> 9270.49s]  Okie dokie. Don't do that. Not nice. Really? Okay. Well, I- this is- I was supposed to fight
[9270.49s -> 9287.59s]  this guy right here. Did I cut his hands off? I'm so confused right now. I think I chopped up
[9287.59s -> 9323.94s]  both that guy's hands. Ah, I thought he was gonna fake it. All right. Wait, that's- all
[9323.94s -> 9327.38s]  right. That's not fair. He's throw- all right. You know, reset. Reset. Not fair.
[9327.38s -> 9368.73s]  Somebody's being a dick. Somebody's being a dick. Okay, here we go. He thought I was gonna
[9368.73s -> 9394.23s]  fake, didn't he? Mm-hmm. He thought I was gonna fake. All right, let's go. Why is everybody naked?
[9404.14s -> 9415.50s]  Over! That was fun. Am I- no, I'm not naked. I'm just default regular character. That was a lot
[9415.50s -> 9425.40s]  of money. 11 h- no, no, no, never mind. All right, I'm gonna do this again. I'm gonna do
[9425.40s -> 9433.46s]  this again, but I'm gonna do, um, what am I- maybe I want to play- I don't have enough
[9433.46s -> 9453.64s]  money to buy anything. I'll try spear. Let me see. The tutorial is gonna give you 2,500. Yeah,
[9453.64s -> 9467.70s]  that's true. It's true. So can I- spear is obviously you want- is there a way to- because
[9467.70s -> 9484.60s]  you don't want to swing a spear, right? It's all about stabs. Oh, fuck. He's relentless.
[9488.89s -> 9494.01s]  Damn, all right. He just was right up in your face with the dagger. I don't really
[9494.01s -> 9501.29s]  like the spears. It's- it almost feels like- it feels like I'm trying too hard to stab.
[9527.99s -> 9535.37s]  Whoa! That was a little laggy. Get a halberd if you want to swing. Yeah. I don't- I can
[9535.37s -> 9546.68s]  unlock it. It's all about spacing with the spear. Yeah, it's- I guess I just don't think
[9546.68s -> 9562.82s]  about how long it is. That's really long. Nah. Nah, I don't like it. I don't like it.
[9562.82s -> 9620.18s]  I don't like it. Let's go raider. All right, let's do it. You and me. Ooh. All right, I'm
[9620.18s -> 9634.39s]  gonna- my stamina is- I'm freaking out! Okay. I just got really panicky. Chamber you casual.
[9634.39s -> 9655.45s]  I don't even know what that means. Oh, he tried to throw that at me. If you stab
[9655.45s -> 9664.12s]  at a stab, you will chamber. Okay. I think- but we have the wrong idea here. I don't know who-
[9664.12s -> 9702.52s]  All right, I guess I'm fighting you. No, it was you? Oh, I thought he was gonna fake.
[9707.06s -> 9716.58s]  Ooh, nice. Damn it. Flourish. Yeah, I know how to flourish. Am I supposed to do that every
[9716.58s -> 9761.61s]  time I want to fight somebody? Damn. I must have got him right in the good spot. Ooh,
[9761.61s -> 9801.10s]  that would have hit me. Hello, Steve. Oh, I was gonna flourish. Ooh, that's a windup.
[9801.10s -> 9831.61s]  The pickaxe is really cool because it has a huge windup. Ooh, chop his legs off. I haven't
[9831.61s -> 9858.10s]  fought you, I don't think. You. Right there. A little belly poke. That's not how you hold a
[9858.10s -> 9880.90s]  sword. He's trying to blunt me. Okay, yeah, sure. Ooh, that like double pump. Nice. He does
[9880.90s -> 9908.18s]  like- that like fake fake pump. Minecraft Steve coming in. Oops. I tried to fucking fake
[9908.18s -> 9918.04s]  it out. Holy fuck, I didn't think that was gonna happen. You never expect somebody to
[9918.04s -> 9945.02s]  throw their weapon. Whoa, what are you trying- what are you trying to pull here?
[9945.02s -> 9960.25s]  Oh, pan guy. Oh, a little too close. Damn. That was fun though. Good job.
[9975.02s -> 9982.81s]  I can't play after that one. Okay, let's try this again. Let's try this again. Wrong
[9982.81s -> 9993.02s]  thing. This thing. Damn. Oh, that's fucking dirty. That sword is awesome.
[9993.74s -> 10028.63s]  I want to fight big guy with huge sword again. Nice. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, nope, nope,
[10028.63s -> 10034.95s]  no, he did it to me too. Oh, did I kill him? Whenever you- somebody drops their weapon,
[10034.95s -> 10040.12s]  they just get- it's like panic syndrome. They just get right in your face. All it takes
[10040.12s -> 10069.21s]  is one little punch. Uh, I guess I'll do you. Whoa, that was weird. Wow, he's like
[10069.21s -> 10074.78s]  spinning. It's like he's starting over here and he ends up like over here. It's weird.
[10074.78s -> 10107.80s]  Let's try it again. Nice. Oh, oh, that guy's- this guy's good. Damn it. Again. Oh, yay.
[10108.36s -> 10133.05s]  Sorry, I pressed the DPI button. No, I tried to switch it. I'm trying to switch it again.
[10133.05s -> 10145.67s]  What the fuck? Good, good, good, good, good. All right, I gotta fight this guy here. He's
[10145.67s -> 10163.48s]  very good. He's very good. Oh, that little like- that little pump is so hard to predict.
[10179.51s -> 10194.94s]  Damn it. Oh, not good. Hey, you wanna reset it or how you doing? You good? What the
[10194.94s -> 10245.13s]  hell was that? Wrong thing. Oh, all right, it was a good poke. Okay. Whoa! I just opened
[10245.13s -> 10252.82s]  the developer console. Sorry. Wait, get out of the developer console. He just like put his
[10252.82s -> 10295.34s]  head down. He was like, oh shit. Oh, ah, I try- I was trying to block it. Do the tutorial
[10295.34s -> 10298.94s]  for money and to get better. I mean, I don't know if I could get better from the tutorial.
[10298.94s -> 10303.91s]  I know pretty much how all the things to do in the game except for I don't really chamber
[10303.91s -> 10345.99s]  that well. This guy's very good. That guy is phenomenal. That guy is exceptional. Did I say
[10345.99s -> 10356.18s]  what the fuck just happened? Hold on, did I just swing and hit his- I'm so confused
[10356.18s -> 10389.64s]  what the hell just happened. I just like hit him. I have no idea. No, I already did
[10389.64s -> 10395.37s]  the tutorial. I mean, I know what's happening. It's not gonna help me. I did it the last
[10395.37s -> 10408.84s]  time I streamed this game. The servers weren't on, so that's not counting. I'm so- what the
[10408.84s -> 10416.12s]  hell is- should I start going like this? Like, should I start like dragging my hands over to
[10416.12s -> 10422.65s]  like help with the bait? Should I like put my sensitivity way up and like- is it- how-
[10422.65s -> 10439.19s]  should I do that? I'm getting kind of fatigued. Gamer fatigue is kind of settling in here.
[10439.19s -> 10455.88s]  It's alright. Just push- hold on, like- no, you can't. I have the DPI button as high as
[10455.88s -> 10489.35s]  I can go. That doesn't really work that well. Damn. Alright, a couple more and then I'm
[10489.35s -> 10501.45s]  probably gonna be done for today. Yeah, I just don't stand a chance when people are this good.
[10506.01s -> 10515.45s]  No way. Yeah, I did promise Bard. I'm gonna play Bard one-on-one.
[10520.65s -> 10527.72s]  Yeah, I'm tired. I'm getting- just everything's blending together. I'll play one- and plus my
[10527.72s -> 10534.81s]  DPI is so fucking high. Remind me to rip these buttons off, by the way, and fucking
[10534.81s -> 10551.45s]  burn them. Alright, let's go, engineer. Mom said it's my turn with the sword. Alright,
[10551.45s -> 10566.57s]  here you go. Ready? I gotta play the song first. Alright, who- who am I fighting here?
[10566.57s -> 10584.28s]  There's too many of you. Wait, what? I've never used this as a weapon before.
[10598.01s -> 10612.79s]  No. Alright, last one. And then I'm gonna call it for tonight. Let's see if I can win with
[10612.79s -> 10635.27s]  the loot. And there is no flourish with this thing. Get out of here. What the hell? Like,
[10635.27s -> 10654.60s]  I was going under the fucking bottom rope of the wrestling ring. I'm gonna die. Alright,
[10654.60s -> 10663.42s]  I'm done. I'm done. I'm outta here. I can't do it anymore. Yeah, like perfect timing.
[10663.42s -> 10675.50s]  That was good. You know, I wanna see people- the guy with the execution of his sword guy.
[10676.14s -> 10681.13s]  I wanna see two guys like that fight each other. I feel like that'd be really,
[10681.13s -> 10694.49s]  really cool to watch. That guy was like in another league. Let me get a-
[10694.49s -> 10699.61s]  This game's really, really fun, though. I know I'm kind of just being like a silent
[10699.61s -> 10711.43s]  try-hard sometimes during this stream, but it's fun. Alright, last one. Actual last one.
[10711.83s -> 10763.19s]  That was fun. That game's so fun. But yeah, that's gonna be it. So I will see you guys.
[10763.19s -> 10768.81s]  Thanks for watching Sam and Max and the kind of part two of the stream, which was
[10769.37s -> 10774.68s]  dicking around on Mordhau again. If you got into play some of those duels,
[10775.40s -> 10779.82s]  thanks for playing. Some of you guys are really fucking good. I mean, that's really
[10779.82s -> 10791.90s]  cool to see. Keep playing and keep kicking ass. So you will see me on my return
[10792.46s -> 10799.90s]  What was part one? We did Sam and Max season one finale. So you will see me again on Wednesday
[10799.90s -> 10807.26s]  because Dreams- Dreams is gonna be on Wednesday. I'm gonna bring you guys a couple of things,
[10807.26s -> 10814.68s]  hopefully, that I've been able to make. And if anybody else has anything made,
[10815.48s -> 10820.01s]  we can go through it as well. If they have, doesn't matter what it is. We'll just kind of
[10820.01s -> 10826.17s]  chill and play it. And then after that, I might move on to something else for PlayStation
[10826.17s -> 10830.90s]  4.2 because we're gonna have the PS4 plugged in. So if we do that for like an hour or two,
[10830.90s -> 10836.86s]  couple hours of showing stuff off, maybe we'll hop in something else and play flick, you know,
[10837.88s -> 10842.70s]  because I do like to, unless it's a big event or something, I like most streams to go
[10842.70s -> 10850.74s]  at least, you know, five and a half to six and a half hours. But thanks for watching.
[10850.74s -> 10865.96s]  I'll see you guys soon on Wednesday to be exact. There's a guide for Mordhau. Yeah,
[10865.96s -> 10870.06s]  I don't know. I might keep playing. I'm not sure how much more I'll stream it,
[10870.06s -> 10878.62s]  but I think I'm gonna keep playing because it is just scratching a FPS, goofy, interesting
[10878.62s -> 10885.16s]  itch. So we'll see. I know I have like a ceiling of how good I can probably get in the game like
[10885.16s -> 10893.22s]  this. So if I ever do, you know, get to a decent level, which I don't know, this is
[10893.22s -> 10902.07s]  somebody first person swinger. Yeah. But it is a damn fun game. I highly recommend it.
[10902.79s -> 10914.97s]  So with that, we'll move on to the bits. Let's see here. There it is. So let's go back to about
[10914.97s -> 10920.90s]  five and a half, six hours ago here. The skill ceiling in the game is huge. But honestly,
[10920.90s -> 10932.46s]  you're doing great. You probably could get much better. Maybe, I don't know. Possibly. It's
[10932.46s -> 10937.10s]  really cool to see the people that are just already finding all the interesting things to
[10937.10s -> 10952.65s]  do. And it's the fainting that's just so interesting to me. It's a blast. Even though
[10952.65s -> 10957.98s]  a lot of times I kind of get my ass kicked, it's still a lot of fun. But Smelly Boy,
[10957.98s -> 10962.06s]  thanks for the 250 earlier. Just want to say thank you so much for being there when I have
[10962.06s -> 10965.90s]  a shitty week. Some days are really rough and it helps so much to stand outside your house at
[10965.90s -> 10977.29s]  2 13 a.m. every morning until 2 16 a.m. That's terrifying. Thank you Smelly Boy for the
[10977.29s -> 10986.90s]  scariest bit message I have ever received. Because that is so specific. That's very
[10987.70s -> 10992.04s]  Thanks for the 250.
[10998.52s -> 11002.76s]  Yeah, I came in and changed it. I woke up this morning and I was like, I feel like
[11002.76s -> 11007.24s]  not that great. But I feel, I knew that by the afternoon I was going to feel better. So
[11007.80s -> 11010.76s]  and I did so I didn't want to obviously and I did say that we were going to do five days
[11010.76s -> 11025.37s]  this week. And we did. So I did want to make sure that I adhered to that. Got to be a
[11025.37s -> 11031.46s]  Vaude Boy. This is a pretty, this is a pretty good stream. This has been a pretty good
[11031.46s -> 11036.44s]  roller coaster weekend. Don't you think? You know, we went up the, we went up the chain
[11037.32s -> 11041.80s]  in the first part of Labo. We got to the peak. I got drunk and said a few swears.
[11042.60s -> 11048.10s]  Just a few. And then we went down the roller coaster with the Labo drunk wine stream. And
[11048.10s -> 11058.10s]  then, hey look, we pulled into the breaks for Sam and Max. A few. What was the name of the
[11058.10s -> 11074.31s]  bacteria? It was Roy G. Biv. Mr. Bliss, Hugh Bliss. But yeah, thank you Frodeo. I'll see you on
[11074.31s -> 11078.79s]  Wednesday. If you'll be there. D Flyers, thanks for the five dollars. D Flyers, if you
[11078.79s -> 11082.39s]  enjoy point and click adventure games, you should play the Submachine series of games.
[11082.39s -> 11085.99s]  They have really good atmosphere and lore as well as being free to play in standard
[11085.99s -> 11093.62s]  definition. Or you can buy the HD versions. Speaking of Sam and Max, what is this?
[11095.50s -> 11108.60s]  Oh, the Max head. That is a perfect, that's perfect. Submachine. I do love point and click
[11108.60s -> 11117.10s]  adventure games. Especially the odd ones. I remember we played Harvester. That was a journey.
[11117.90s -> 11129.00s]  Sam and Max is cool too. When was the last time I got a sunburn? I got a little bit of sun
[11129.72s -> 11138.68s]  a couple weeks ago when my mother was here. But thank you D Flyers. I'll look, I'll type
[11138.68s -> 11153.08s]  into Google right now. Submarine, Submachine. You know what this looks like? I played a
[11153.08s -> 11158.68s]  series of point and click adventure, almost escape room type games. Is this more like
[11158.68s -> 11167.05s]  an escape room? What's the series? It's called the Cube or something. There's like 10 parts
[11167.05s -> 11184.02s]  of it. What is it called? It's called like the Cube. Oh, Cube Escape. Yeah, Cube Escape.
[11184.82s -> 11191.02s]  Cube Escape is, I've played all of them. They're really, really good. They're really interesting.
[11192.39s -> 11200.12s]  But this, this kind of looks similar. It's like a, almost like an escape room,
[11200.76s -> 11208.36s]  which I love the room. That's my favorite adventure game, escape room type game.
[11209.16s -> 11213.88s]  But Cube Escape is, reminds me of what you just linked me. You didn't link anything. I
[11213.88s -> 11218.87s]  typed it into Google. But thank you for the recommendation. I will look into more of that
[11218.87s -> 11224.15s]  off stream. Mr. Comcast back again for five dollars. Hey, German John Comcast here.
[11224.95s -> 11229.46s]  Just letting you know that I got a restraining order the other day. So I can't go near any
[11229.46s -> 11233.14s]  washed up YouTubers. Don't worry though, I'm working on it just for you. Anyway,
[11233.14s -> 11236.10s]  in a completely unrelated subject, I saw you in Walmart the other day. I was going to say
[11236.10s -> 11240.50s]  hi. But then you started fighting the other children to get the last V bucks card that was
[11240.50s -> 11246.26s]  sitting on the shelf. So I didn't want to disturb you. I found it weird when you started
[11246.26s -> 11256.12s]  crying though. Give me that. Give me that. Idiot. Idiot. Dumb idiot head. That's what I would do
[11256.12s -> 11263.70s]  if that were real. Hey, The Jack. Thanks for the three dollars. You said you needed money to get
[11264.58s -> 11267.94s]  Jimmy off the parking meter. So here you go. Hey, thanks. It worked.
[11270.97s -> 11279.14s]  Snooze and Crofter. Thanks for the 250. You mentioned Mordhau and I played Mordhau.
[11279.78s -> 11283.29s]  I saw Vinny stream Mordhau. I think you guys would play it together.
[11283.29s -> 11286.97s]  Now that the game actually works, you can create your own character. I'd like to see that.
[11286.97s -> 11290.41s]  Also, I was reminded about how some people here were talking about how they met each other
[11290.41s -> 11294.81s]  because of your Discord. I didn't. And my girlfriend is almost getting jealous because
[11294.81s -> 11309.67s]  I mentioned you so much. She kind of hates you now. Sorry. Well, tell her it's just
[11309.67s -> 11314.70s]  tell her it's like Netflix. What are you watching there? It's like Netflix. You don't
[11314.70s -> 11327.93s]  have to just just it's like Netflix. That's all you have to say. But I mean, I'm always
[11327.93s -> 11333.21s]  down to play with people that, you know, obviously like Vinny and Metallix, Joel,
[11334.17s -> 11338.33s]  even like Star. It doesn't matter. It just, you know, depends on what they're doing,
[11339.21s -> 11351.69s]  what people's schedules are, what people want to do. Pipe Joel again. Yeah, that's so funny
[11351.69s -> 11356.73s]  how that just was, that was all talk from the both of us. It's hilarious. Oh, even,
[11357.37s -> 11368.52s]  yeah, you know, even Star. Hey, multi-trip. Thanks for the $15. Silence Redditor. Oh,
[11368.52s -> 11375.59s]  I forgot to do Bleed Purple Don't Hit Me. I'm not going to, what are you talking about?
[11375.59s -> 11384.26s]  Thanks for the, oh, okay, I see. Thanks for the $15. And thanks for the extra bonus bits
[11384.26s -> 11395.16s]  are there too. Thank you. Multi-trip. 15 bucks. Also, Hohohokuma. Hohohokuma. Thanks
[11395.24s -> 11400.20s]  for the $10. Have you ever played Silent Hill 2 or would you consider doing a stream on it?
[11401.54s -> 11404.50s]  First of all, thanks for the 10 bucks. And yes, I've played through Silent Hill 2,
[11404.50s -> 11412.95s]  long time ago. And I have a kind of a rule on this channel where if I've already played the
[11412.95s -> 11420.12s]  game, especially if it's a single player game, not on stream or in video format,
[11421.32s -> 11427.48s]  I probably don't, I won't do it again because I like the idea of playing things
[11428.44s -> 11436.76s]  and experiencing them for the first time with people here. And if I know what's going on
[11436.76s -> 11442.04s]  and I know what happens in the game and I know what the major encounters are, it makes it almost,
[11442.84s -> 11450.55s]  I'd rather not. I'd rather experience it for the first time. But I have played it,
[11450.55s -> 11463.96s]  it is a classic. Explain Clock Tower. Clock Tower? I never played that Clock Tower game
[11464.04s -> 11480.33s]  before that stream. I just started and finished it in one stream. I forgot about that. But thank
[11480.33s -> 11486.41s]  you Hohohokuma for the $10. Appreciate it. Super Bruce, thanks for $5. Hey Jerma,
[11486.41s -> 11489.37s]  I'm going to be in Vegas for just a day for a business trip and I need a recommendation
[11489.37s -> 11493.45s]  where to eat. What's your favorite spot? Price is irrelevant. Hash house a go go in the link.
[11494.57s -> 11502.30s]  That's my favorite restaurant in all of Las Vegas. Torati right now, 10 community subs.
[11502.38s -> 11509.67s]  Torati gave I believe 20 community subs earlier last night. Thank you so much Torati
[11510.39s -> 11520.42s]  for your huge amount of community subs. It was Torati, there was at least three or four people
[11520.42s -> 11532.74s]  that gave more than 10 or 20 last night. But yes, Super Bruce. The Bacchanel in Paris,
[11532.74s -> 11539.58s]  not Paris, in Caesars Palace is insane. It's a buffet. It's one of the best buffets I've
[11539.58s -> 11544.86s]  ever been to, the Bacchanel. Hash house a go go is probably my favorite restaurant.
[11545.66s -> 11561.93s]  There's no shortage of good food in Vegas, that's for sure. But um, have fun in Vegas.
[11566.04s -> 11569.48s]  Hopefully you oh and if you go to Hash house a go go, you got to get the blue cheese burger.
[11570.44s -> 11573.96s]  The burger is the best thing on that. It's the best burger I've ever had in my life.
[11573.96s -> 11581.06s]  It is the best hamburger you will ever eat. That is a Jerma985 guarantee. The blue cheese
[11581.06s -> 11588.22s]  stuffed burger. There it is. Unless you hate blue cheese, which in that case there's a couple other
[11588.22s -> 11594.23s]  ones on the menu. Have you ever been to Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in Vegas? Yes, I've been
[11594.23s -> 11599.27s]  to Gordon Ramsay's steak once. And it was immensely expensive, but it was one of the
[11599.27s -> 11605.67s]  best pieces of meat I've ever had. That's another great one. That one is in Paris.
[11605.67s -> 11609.03s]  Gordon Ramsay's steak in Paris is fantastic. Yes, that's the third one I would probably
[11609.03s -> 11614.71s]  recommend. You've mentioned that price is irrelevant. Well, I hope that's the case,
[11614.71s -> 11618.55s]  because if you go to Gordon Ramsay's steak, you are going to do that thing where you open
[11618.55s -> 11622.39s]  up the check and go, and then close it immediately and look around and be like,
[11622.39s -> 11626.71s]  so we are splitting up who's who's who got what did you get? Did you get a drink?
[11627.67s -> 11644.92s]  So be prepared for that. He's a cheap streamer. No, you ordered the two vodka tonics,
[11644.92s -> 11654.36s]  right? I mean, I got I got a tea. And it was like 250. Your three vodka tonics were like,
[11654.36s -> 11659.24s]  45 bucks. So we split in there and we split in the bill. You're just going to give me like
[11659.24s -> 11666.20s]  cash or how does that work? I mean, mine was like mine was like 12. Yours was like 80.
[11666.20s -> 11675.13s]  Are we just going to split in half? There's a I think there's a whole entire Larry David
[11675.13s -> 11679.69s]  segment of exactly what I'm describing. I think this is an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.
[11680.33s -> 11691.40s]  I think it is. But have fun on your trip Super Bruce. Hash House at Go-Go.
[11691.40s -> 11693.08s]  Freudian Weapon. Thanks for the 250, Freudian.
[11693.80s -> 11697.08s]  Since you don't call your mom for money, I'll send you some instead. Have a good night,
[11697.08s -> 11705.35s]  sweetie. Thanks, mom. Appreciate it, mom. Let's see some Jerma Hearts from mom.
[11708.06s -> 11715.05s]  Jerma lied about 5k subs. Thanks for the 250. Your color is going to be piss brown
[11715.61s -> 11720.25s]  tomorrow. Wait, what? What is it? I don't know. What is this Jerma lied about 5,000 subs?
[11724.23s -> 11741.10s]  What's this a reference to? 5,000 gifted subs. Well, did I lie? I don't know.
[11748.10s -> 11761.35s]  Did I lie? What? I don't know what I even lied about. I got a video here from Effectator.
[11762.07s -> 11767.10s]  I don't want to put it up. Sorry, I'm being like silent because I'm trying to see
[11768.06s -> 11775.14s]  what just happened to my stream labs. Oh, Dr. Steen comes in with five community subs.
[11775.14s -> 11789.51s]  Thank you, Dr. Steen. Five more subs flying in. This is from Effectator. 250 from Effectator.
[11790.07s -> 11795.27s]  Finishing up the Hotline Miami 2 video felt contractually obligated to make this.
[11796.54s -> 11800.54s]  PikaBanana5 community subs back to back to back here. Thank you, PikaBanana.
[11801.26s -> 11803.26s]  Let's see what this is.
[11853.56s -> 11866.18s]  Jesus. Well, that was fucking awesome. Thank you, Effectator.
[11868.94s -> 11879.50s]  That was the most intense. That was okay. Sekiro was really hard and was really relentless,
[11880.76s -> 11886.90s]  but I believe that Hotline Miami 2 may have been the hardest I've ever tried on stream
[11886.90s -> 11896.94s]  in a video game. That is the most frustrated and annoyed and hardest I've probably ever
[11896.94s -> 11908.57s]  tried on stream. Sekiro came close, but I was able to like talk myself down in Sekiro.
[11910.23s -> 11916.47s]  I was not able to give myself a chill out talk at any point during Hotline Miami 2.
[11917.03s -> 11919.99s]  It was just, I stepped on the gas and just went until the car turned off.
[11929.22s -> 11933.62s]  I would recommend that game though. Mario Tennis was blood fuel.
[11937.59s -> 11941.83s]  Nah, Simpsons Hit and Run was not, I was not getting angry at Simpsons Hit and Run.
[11941.83s -> 11954.25s]  I was just going crazy. How do I feel about Mordhau? I think it's great. I think it's a
[11954.25s -> 11961.03s]  really, really fun, funny, interesting, cool, gigantic battle simulator. It's awesome.
[11965.00s -> 11969.66s]  But thank you Effectator for that video. It was great. Thanks for the $252.
[11969.66s -> 11973.26s]  Thank you Multitrip for the $5. Congrats on top fragging in a pub.
[11975.90s -> 11978.54s]  I'm not sure if, I'm not sure if that's supposed to be mean.
[11980.12s -> 11983.40s]  Is that like a, is that a, is that, that's not, because some people might be like,
[11983.40s -> 11988.44s]  hey, congratulations on top fragging in a pub. You know, there's, but there's no space there.
[11988.44s -> 11994.36s]  There's no dash. Okay. No, this is actual, this is actual praise because it's just
[11994.36s -> 11999.53s]  congrats on top fragging in a pub. What I'm describing would be congrats on top fragging
[11999.53s -> 12005.27s]  dot dot dot dot in a pub. So this is a good, that's a compliment. Thank you.
[12005.83s -> 12013.16s]  Appreciate that. Thanks for the $5 too. Thank you Rain for the $3.
[12013.80s -> 12020.34s]  Jerma is getting Kingdom Come flashbacks. No, no. I was just having fun.
[12024.82s -> 12028.50s]  Captain Worgen, thanks for the $4. Hey Jerma, cool to see you getting into Mordhau.
[12028.50s -> 12031.54s]  I haven't been able to catch these streams in a while and there are too many new VODs
[12031.54s -> 12038.10s]  for me to catch up on. You need to control your streaming addiction. Well, I mean,
[12038.10s -> 12043.06s]  a lot of that has to do with, I've streamed five times this week. I've streamed what?
[12043.06s -> 12045.94s]  Five of the last six days, five of the last seven days. I don't usually do that.
[12047.59s -> 12054.02s]  Some of them have been long. I typically only stream four-ish, four times a week,
[12054.02s -> 12060.52s]  three or four times a week. So I have streamed a lot in the last five days, six days.
[12061.48s -> 12069.08s]  Maybe that's why. But I was gone for a long time, so I kind of want to make up for it.
[12077.45s -> 12081.91s]  I don't really plan that. It just kind of, you know, if I feel like going five days,
[12081.91s -> 12087.24s]  four, five, six days, whatever. Do I have a date for season two of Sam and Max? Yes,
[12087.24s -> 12093.26s]  Friday. We'll do Sam and Max season two, at least the first probably couple, two or three
[12093.26s -> 12105.54s]  episodes maybe on Friday night. Dreams will be on Wednesday. Thursday's a mystery stream.
[12106.34s -> 12112.12s]  Could be anything. I wouldn't miss it. Could be anything. And then Friday we'll do Sam and Max,
[12112.12s -> 12118.36s]  and then we'll take Sunday, Saturday off, and we'll be back on Sunday or something.
[12119.08s -> 12126.06s]  So we'll do two days off here, three days on, one day off, one day on. That'll complete
[12126.06s -> 12137.32s]  the week there. World of Warcraft? Hmm. You know what I considered for a second?
[12138.04s -> 12145.88s]  Just doing a community World of Warcraft classic. Just be dickheads and just run around together
[12145.88s -> 12151.61s]  and take over servers. But I would only really want to do that if it was, if we could separate
[12151.61s -> 12156.86s]  ourselves. Because I really don't, I don't want to fuck up somebody else's game. If we can
[12156.86s -> 12168.06s]  find some low population server and nobody's on, and just start at zero and try to get
[12168.06s -> 12172.54s]  to molten core with 40 people and only the strong survive. You know what I mean? Like if you,
[12173.74s -> 12179.50s]  we've got to come up with 40 people to do molten core. And if we don't beat molten core
[12180.22s -> 12185.10s]  every time we wipe, something happens. I don't know. We have to beat molten core with viewers
[12185.10s -> 12192.68s]  only. Somebody just gave 50 bucks. By the way, that is probably impossible. What I just
[12192.68s -> 12198.44s]  described is not even remotely completable. Maybe we can do it though. It might be fun.
[12199.16s -> 12209.54s]  Tora T on top of the massive community subs gave 50 bucks. Thank you so much. 50 dollars.
[12209.54s -> 12213.30s]  And just want to say you're my favorite streamer and savior of my rough college days.
[12213.30s -> 12216.82s]  I've been gifting subs from time to time and will continue to support you in this amazing
[12216.82s -> 12220.90s]  community. Keep up the amazing work, Jerma. We'll all be supporting your future works.
[12223.03s -> 12232.87s]  Thank you. I'm so fucking happy to hear that you think this is an amazing community. That
[12232.95s -> 12245.83s]  you think it's a great place to be. Sorry about your rough college time. I am honored to be your
[12245.83s -> 12249.43s]  favorite streamer. Thank you for the 50 dollars. Thank you for the hundreds of other dollars
[12249.43s -> 12260.01s]  you've given with community subs. Thank you. And from that, we're going to be moving to
[12263.45s -> 12269.91s]  sly161 for 250. Hey Jerma, you may not have seen me, but I got into the first few Mordhau
[12269.91s -> 12273.43s]  games. It was pretty fun. Would you ever consider making a server on a multiplayer
[12273.43s -> 12279.85s]  game like this where fans could hang out? Yeah, here's my one issue with making a server.
[12280.57s -> 12285.34s]  The same kind of thing happened to the TF2 server that I ran years and years and years ago.
[12286.30s -> 12294.46s]  I just wasn't around to manage it. And you get admins and mods and sometimes it's almost
[12294.46s -> 12298.94s]  like you build it, you make it, and you have it just open. And then if there's ever a
[12298.94s -> 12302.38s]  problem or something, it comes back to me and they're like, hey, something's going on
[12302.38s -> 12307.26s]  on the server. And I'm like, oh, fuck the server, right? Okay, let me get in contact with an admin.
[12308.70s -> 12313.58s]  Honestly, it would probably be one of those scenarios where if I were to do something
[12313.58s -> 12319.34s]  like that, I would just pay for the server and it would just be like I would hand that
[12319.34s -> 12324.38s]  off completely to just somebody in the community, a handful of people that really
[12324.38s -> 12329.50s]  wanted to do that. And I would just pay for it. And it would be a community run server
[12330.14s -> 12339.30s]  that I was just essentially just keeping turned on. Because it's just hard to be that guy that
[12339.30s -> 12344.42s]  gets the message like, hey, there's a hacker in your server. And he's like spinning fucking
[12345.06s -> 12355.06s]  earblast music. And it's like, oh, okay, let me go into console. It's hard to manage that.
[12355.06s -> 12358.10s]  And I'd rather just have somebody in the community take that over completely.
[12358.74s -> 12372.46s]  But it's an interesting idea. Maybe I'll talk to some of the mods about it and we'll see if
[12372.46s -> 12382.57s]  anybody would be interested in if anybody likes the game or something maybe. But I do miss that
[12382.57s -> 12390.25s]  aspect of just being able to jump into my server. And it's just there's my server. And I always
[12390.25s -> 12396.30s]  know I have a spot on it. And there'll be people in it. That was a pretty cool thing.
[12396.30s -> 12401.82s]  A lot of the videos on TF2. I mean, maybe some of you people that are new to the channel
[12401.82s -> 12407.58s]  recently in the last year or two. But a lot of those TF2 videos that required
[12407.58s -> 12413.90s]  like 30 people to do something weird were done on my server. And people lining up and
[12413.90s -> 12421.10s]  listening to the things that I was telling them to do. So it was a lot of fun to have
[12421.10s -> 12433.03s]  that opportunity to do it. But moving on from that, multi trip, thanks to the $9 multi trip.
[12434.07s -> 12442.49s]  And he says, Oppa Gagnum style. Those are the people who, you know, know you from the
[12442.49s -> 12451.80s]  servers. Thank you multi trip for the $9. I think Gagnum style is a dance in the game, right?
[12452.60s -> 12461.48s]  Thank you for the $9. pasta globs thanks to the 250 haha manual blinking and breathing what
[12461.48s -> 12480.01s]  was it what is that manual blinking and breathing blinking fuck you fuck you what's
[12480.01s -> 12494.39s]  going on oh it's to force you to think about your blinking and breathing he's too dumb to
[12494.39s -> 12505.02s]  get it he's immune did it just bounce off me good uh gutsy thanks for the three dollars and 12 cents
[12505.02s -> 12512.54s]  gutsy sorry for pan but this game is a lot of fun germ ejects i i did have like three or four
[12512.54s -> 12524.41s]  pan guys coming after me there was at least three trying they were like in the back of
[12524.41s -> 12529.29s]  the crowd just throwing pans over they were lining me up in their sights oh i know he's
[12529.29s -> 12537.56s]  backing up i just trying to hit me in the head with a pan i was being pan harassed
[12538.20s -> 12540.52s]  reminded me of the brupac tf2 flashbacks
[12546.28s -> 12559.24s]  remember that i missed that noise do you really do you actually miss that noise
[12565.10s -> 12568.30s]  you'll hear that sound again and go whoa and pull the headphones off
[12571.10s -> 12579.74s]  but thank you gutsy for the three dollars and 12 cents and thanks for playing i'm glad you had
