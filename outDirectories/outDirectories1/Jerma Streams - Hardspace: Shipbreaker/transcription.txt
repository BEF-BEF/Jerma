[3.26s -> 7.58s]  Uh, so I have no idea how this game works. We're gonna give it a try. See if it's any good.
[10.18s -> 14.98s]  Hard Space Ship Breaker. Okay, I did already make an account in this game because I knew we were
[14.98s -> 20.98s]  probably gonna pivot because... I don't know. I had it just in case. We needed to do it, right?
[21.54s -> 43.13s]  Turn this shit on so you can hear it. And we add it. Looking for a... There you are.
[43.69s -> 53.70s]  This is Hard Space Ship Breaker. This for cleanup detail in space is what I've been told. We're ready
[53.70s -> 57.62s]  for Evolvo. Okay, anybody that says anything that says Evolvo in it and please play it,
[57.62s -> 65.99s]  I want you to ban them for at least four hours. At least. That's like 240,000 minutes.
[66.55s -> 90.94s]  Don't want that one. All right, let's go. This is me, Jerry. Career. Please, please. How do you...
[90.94s -> 105.85s]  How does this game work? I guess it's gonna tell me, right? Wait, was I supposed to jump?
[111.62s -> 140.87s]  I can't even hear his audio. Okay, shh. Let's get to work. All right, how do I do this? Open
[140.87s -> 156.09s]  the work order. Thrust forward. Thrust backward. Descend. Ascend. Break. Roll. Oh, boy. Thrust
[156.09s -> 167.38s]  backwards. Now, uh, descend for three seconds. I want to change that though. I don't like to see
[167.38s -> 182.07s]  his descend. Descend for three seconds. Controls break. I'm so glad there's a break that's a hard
[182.07s -> 203.62s]  break. Grapple. It rolls. Yeah, roll left for two seconds. Depute game. That's all right. I've been
[203.62s -> 222.09s]  known to at least get an hour into puke games. Grapple. Grapple. Hold. Push an object when
[222.09s -> 232.58s]  grappled is F. Some objects can be detached with your grapple. Look for the detach prompt. Whoa,
[232.58s -> 247.29s]  wait a minute. That's a push? So F pushes. I want it to descend. Can you not move when you're in
[247.29s -> 256.10s]  the... Okay, maybe you can't move. All right, salvage the antenna. How do you salvage something?
[256.10s -> 272.10s]  Grapple. And then I drag it over here. Green arrows. Yeah, but how do I pull it over there?
[272.58s -> 284.71s]  Use the grapple to attach an antenna. Push when... Push. No, that's not an antenna.
[285.27s -> 296.82s]  Oh, where the... Where the fuck is an antenna? Wait, that's the antenna. This doesn't look like
[296.82s -> 306.49s]  an antenna. I thought it wanted me to grapple with weird things. I don't know. It didn't... Okay.
[307.05s -> 317.14s]  Grapple the antenna. Hit the brakes. Breaks. Breaks. Break. Oh, this is not going to work well.
[317.14s -> 320.30s]  This is going to be bad. This is going to be bad. This is going to be very bad. I'm not going to be
[320.30s -> 336.22s]  able to do this. Attach an antenna. This is going to be really tricky. Okay, grab and detach.
[336.86s -> 358.34s]  Shoot the antenna. Didn't I just do that? All right, then throw it in there.
[386.73s -> 412.87s]  Physics gun. The whole game is physics. No. Scanner. Cut points. Oh, cut points. I see some.
[412.87s -> 432.22s]  Are they yellow? Okay, so you need to cut this shit. Cut level two. Execute the cut. Grapple.
[432.22s -> 461.70s]  Equip the cutter. Z. It's two. Could it be Z? Okay, let me see it. I'm trying to do the cut.
[461.70s -> 473.98s]  Okay, I just pressed two. I pressed it like five times. Descend! It's C. Oh my god, it's not
[473.98s -> 487.14s]  control. You were grappling. Amazon keyboard. No, no, I wouldn't... I don't even know what direction
[487.14s -> 494.84s]  we've been looking at this fucking thing. All right, scan it. Right there. All right, stop moving.
[494.84s -> 522.22s]  Cut that. Cutting it. Can I do it? Cut point. Right there, right? Does it have to go through it?
[522.22s -> 535.91s]  Isn't the cut point right here? Salvage it. Yeah, but do I have to pull it off? I don't understand.
[535.91s -> 542.82s]  Do I have to be like looking? I thought it was x-ray vision, guys. I thought it was x-ray vision.
[542.82s -> 560.31s]  I thought that was inside of this thing. Is it because I'm too far away? What the fuck is going
[560.31s -> 589.34s]  on? Am I not cutting it? Okay, so you have to be right next to it. Okay, what? There's another one
[589.34s -> 607.45s]  right here. There it goes. All right, cool. I get it. Can I spin this thing around? Wrong timing,
[607.45s -> 613.80s]  though. The floating around. You guys watch me play Outer Wilds. This is like extra controls.
[613.80s -> 630.68s]  I want space to be down. Space should be down. And I want... What the hell do I want? Like one
[630.68s -> 648.58s]  of the mouse buttons. Okay, so that's that side done. Cut this thing right here. I don't think
[648.58s -> 652.58s]  you have to actually cut it. I think you just have to let it heat it up till it disappears.
[652.58s -> 672.12s]  I'm going to salvage this thing somehow. So can I... Do I have to go around it?
[673.32s -> 689.03s]  This thing actually cut through walls. Okay, so I'm done cutting. Am I? So it cuts through walls.
[689.75s -> 708.74s]  Is there face damage? Is it like into the screen damage? I'm just gonna hold the break the whole
[708.74s -> 740.20s]  time. I had it right. Go closer. Go closer. What the fuck? What? I don't... What am I doing wrong?
[740.20s -> 765.45s]  The arrows. What? I'm not supposed to cut all this shit? Or... We just pick it up? All right,
[765.45s -> 779.94s]  where's that salvage thing? All right, there it is. All right, throwing. Is that gonna get in there
[779.94s -> 814.70s]  or is that not gonna make it? It's not gonna make it. Space. Yeah, isn't it? It's supposed to be.
[827.27s -> 834.12s]  Not flat earth. You don't have to grapple to push. Oh, all right. Okay, I get it. Cool.
[834.12s -> 848.73s]  Don't have to cut all the yellow. Just the ones that they point at. Cool. Certification. 16 out of
[848.73s -> 856.12s]  16. I got it. I'm good. I have a hot trillion dollars. Why am I working here? Oh, that's my
[856.12s -> 890.12s]  debt. That's how much I owe. Oh, okay. Probably bull shit. Go home. Trillion dollar debt. Yeah,
[890.12s -> 920.38s]  that's weird. That seems like a lot. All right, I got it. I went home. Get in the habitat. He did
[920.38s -> 930.01s]  it. Whoa, yay. Rank two. You've achieved the prestigious rank of basic certification. You
[930.01s -> 945.43s]  unlocked modular laser cutter upgrades and ship class. Yeah, complete the shift. Minimum payments
[945.43s -> 972.12s]  are due? Whoa. What's this? Laser cutter. Okay. So, this is split saw license? Cutting head fires
[972.12s -> 985.08s]  a splitting beam for speedier and more capable ship disassembly. Yeah, that sounds cool. Start
[985.08s -> 1007.77s]  shift. That's too many things. I don't understand all these things. Thank you. Can you tell if
[1007.77s -> 1016.52s]  everybody can chat that, please? I can't run until I know how to walk. Establish maximum amount of
[1016.52s -> 1044.82s]  value. Split saw. I can swap the head. Okay. Rotate the cut angle. All right, let's go.
[1049.27s -> 1056.57s]  Work order? All right, salvage the soft crate, the aluminum, and the nano carbon. All right,
[1056.57s -> 1064.36s]  where's the aluminum? All right. Processor. We're going to the processor. This one here.
[1064.36s -> 1081.53s]  What do we got? There's nothing in there. Where's the aluminum? Oh, that's where I was about to go
[1081.53s -> 1090.76s]  into it. I was about to trash myself into the furnace. I thought these were like Mario paintings.
[1092.58s -> 1098.74s]  I was going to go in them and say, oh, here, this is this area. All right. Is this thing right here?
[1098.74s -> 1111.06s]  Oh, this panel's aluminum. Oh, sick. Why can't I pull it off? All right, this is cutting angle.
[1111.62s -> 1119.24s]  Got to go right here. Ready? That was pretty cool. Did it do anything? Oh, fuck. I just didn't
[1119.24s -> 1153.42s]  mean to do that. Wait, I took it off. Am I supposed to do that? Wait, like this, right? Wow. I got it.
[1153.42s -> 1166.66s]  It's aluminum. Okay, I like this game. This game's cool. Let's go. I need one that can carry heavy
[1166.66s -> 1181.13s]  objects into the processor, right? The processor wants aluminum? Processor aluminum. Doesn't want
[1181.13s -> 1203.90s]  aluminum. No. Oh, there's a processor in here. Hold on. This computer's in here. Is this somebody's
[1203.90s -> 1213.67s]  computer? Is there a flashlight? Wait, where's the processor? I just saw it. Is that it? Is that a
[1213.67s -> 1236.98s]  processor? Is there a flashlight? There's not. All right, that's a... I can't just pick it up.
[1236.98s -> 1242.23s]  Oh, shit. Okay, this processor. Be careful with this thing. All right, get it in there.
[1242.79s -> 1266.28s]  It's like Paperboy. It's not a processor. This is a barge. Furnace. Processor. Is the processor in
[1266.28s -> 1277.75s]  here? Wow, this computer sucks. I can't take... I can't pick it up. I have to cut it out with this,
[1277.75s -> 1300.60s]  don't I? Oh! Pretending. What are you talking about? That processor's right there. I'm trying to pull
[1300.60s -> 1325.46s]  it out. I can't pull it out. For the processor. Furnace. Barge. Well, we don't... Oh. I don't have
[1325.46s -> 1328.42s]  a barge. So what the fuck am I supposed to do with this? That's why it's freaking me out.
[1328.42s -> 1350.30s]  All right, cut this shit up. It's not a computer. This is still connected. Hold on. What else is
[1350.30s -> 1355.50s]  there? It's still connected. Fuck you. All right, everything's... Nope. Down here. Disconnect this,
[1355.50s -> 1375.22s]  too. All right, everything's been disconnected. Cut this. They didn't say it had to be pretty.
[1375.78s -> 1395.99s]  Come on, get up. This is supposed to go to the barge, but I don't have a barge.
[1395.99s -> 1433.53s]  All right, don't mess it up. Hit the brakes. Wow! It'll get in. It's that thing below you.
[1435.21s -> 1445.00s]  Oh, okay. Where's that thing that I threw? What's that for? Barge? All right, I got a barge. It's
[1445.00s -> 1458.94s]  down here. Don't please get in the corner. Okay, good. Shit, I didn't do it though. I threw... All
[1458.94s -> 1478.58s]  right, I get it now. I understand it now. Processor. Furnace, I mean. Okay. Aluminum has been salvaged.
[1478.58s -> 1488.92s]  That wasn't... Wait, what's going on? Why does this say processor now? What? This is a different
[1488.92s -> 1502.63s]  material? The other one... The front panel was furnace. Handle. Nanocarbon. Processor. Okay.
[1511.69s -> 1530.26s]  Maybe play a game that you can handle. Ban that guy for now. Do I have to cut anything on this?
[1530.90s -> 1546.01s]  All this is going to the processor, so just punch it. I could cut it into smaller pieces. I could,
[1546.01s -> 1556.71s]  but I could just dump it in here, couldn't I? This whole thing. Processor. Yeah, the whole thing.
[1556.71s -> 1568.50s]  Processor. Processor. Processor. Get it in there. Why cut them into small pieces? Do you take the
[1568.58s -> 1579.18s]  whole thing? Okay, this is all processor. Processor. Processor. All right, get it in there.
[1579.18s -> 1605.85s]  Eventually, it's probably gonna be too heavy to do that, but it's fine. So this whole... This needs
[1605.85s -> 1616.30s]  to go into the furnace. That's the barge. Let's get it. All right, now I just need to do the
[1616.30s -> 1629.98s]  aluminum. I gotta cut this though, don't I? I can't take the whole thing. Can I cut this in half?
[1630.78s -> 1645.77s]  Does that not work? Holy shit, that's awesome. Wait, this is actually how I cut up an apple.
[1646.71s -> 1649.59s]  That's so cool. I just needed to see it for myself. Okay, processor. Get it in there.
[1660.50s -> 1675.53s]  Furnace. Furnace. This is awesome. This is awesome. I love this. Okay, processor.
[1675.53s -> 1690.60s]  You got it. Okay. Furnace. What is this? Let's go down. I gotta cut this up a little more.
[1691.16s -> 1711.83s]  Okay, this is the furnace. We got like one crumb. I'm not doing that right. No, no, no, no, no. Give
[1711.83s -> 1730.70s]  me, give me, give me. I don't know why I get what you're saying, but I get what you're saying.
[1731.26s -> 1735.88s]  I get it. I don't know how it makes sense, but it does. Somebody said this is like trying to stuff
[1735.88s -> 1742.73s]  an entire steak in your mouth. Yeah, it kind of is. It's that same energy. It's got that same vibe to
[1742.73s -> 1762.82s]  it. Okay, get this thing up. I gotta cut. Can I not cut through this shit? All right, into the
[1762.82s -> 1771.13s]  furnace. This is taking me so long to do this. This is gonna get like studied. There's gonna be
[1771.13s -> 1787.13s]  a room full of guys in suits studying this with lab coats on. I have to detach it from here.
[1787.13s -> 1797.43s]  Feels so good to do that though. I don't even care if it looks like shit. It feels good.
[1798.31s -> 1811.21s]  Okay, don't let it fly away. Furnace. It'll get there. How many more do I need? 200 kilograms?
[1816.81s -> 1825.26s]  Please. He's cutting the crust off his sandwiches.
[1825.90s -> 1834.96s]  Cut.
[1837.18s -> 1847.37s]  Go to a processor. What the fuck are you talking about? No, no, no. Only one of those goes into the
[1847.37s -> 1859.64s]  processor. Stay right here. Which one of those goes in the processor? The thing on top? I need
[1859.64s -> 1867.13s]  to swim over here. All right, stop, stop, stop, stop. I have to cut this out. This is furnace.
[1867.13s -> 1891.72s]  This is processor. I can't remove this. Oh, oh, wow. This is fun. Sick. This game's awesome.
[1892.36s -> 1909.43s]  I love this game. Okay, I need one more for the furnace. That's a tuber voice. No, it's not. I
[1909.43s -> 1936.63s]  did it. I got extra money. I did it. Keep going. That's such a mess. I'd rather start new now that
[1936.63s -> 1945.91s]  I get it. I truly get it now. So that's things over there. It's just an absolute train wreck.
[1946.55s -> 1961.64s]  Oh, I unlocked grapple upgrade. Destroyed. I didn't lose any money though, right? All right,
[1961.64s -> 1980.54s]  that's fine. New equipment. Grapple. Peather. Peathers can be deployed to establish two
[1980.54s -> 1984.62s]  electromagnetic anchors that pull objects along a field medium. All right, that's huge.
[1985.42s -> 2002.31s]  That's actually huge. Use ship catalog? What is this thing? What is that? Current ship.
[2003.03s -> 2008.57s]  Claiming a new ship will clear the salvage bay of your existing ship.
[2011.03s -> 2032.86s]  What? Who cares? Yes, this is technically another cleaning game. Man. Wow. Okay,
[2032.86s -> 2038.49s]  I gotta be careful. Cutter temporarily disabled to prevent unnecessary destruction to company
[2038.49s -> 2073.03s]  equipped by inexperienced cutters. It's tether? All right, cancel tethers. Tether multiple objects
[2073.03s -> 2086.20s]  together or stack multiple on a single object for even greater strength. Sick. All right,
[2086.20s -> 2100.95s]  I got it. I did tethers. What's pulling them in? Should it be doing that? Okay, now what?
[2100.95s -> 2119.21s]  Cutter is disabled. Why is the cutter disabled? What is this? Can I pull this stuff off?
[2120.17s -> 2138.22s]  Tether to the barge. New work order. Salvage the nassil. Okay, where's my cutter? Why is it
[2138.22s -> 2149.83s]  my cutter's disabled? How do I delete the cutter? I need to put this in the barge.
[2150.71s -> 2166.49s]  Throw the thrusters into the barge. No, why did I want me to tether these? You're gonna pull it?
[2166.49s -> 2186.09s]  Okay, cancel tether. What? That's like 600 light years away. I did not know the range was that
[2186.09s -> 2193.59s]  extreme. Okay, my cutter only goes like four feet. My tethers go across the entire Atlantic Ocean.
[2194.23s -> 2233.30s]  Use more tethers? Oh, shit. Okay, compression points? Okay, I see a lot of green. What's the
[2233.30s -> 2281.88s]  green mean? Okay, airlock. Enter through the airlock. I have to go in? What the fuck? What the hell?
[2282.36s -> 2314.23s]  Wait, I'm in another game. This is freaking me out. Pressurize. That's it? For the atmosphere
[2314.23s -> 2332.10s]  regulator? It has a nuke sign on it. Engine. Cabin. Cabin. Airlock. Cabin. Cabin. Cabin. Cabin.
[2333.13s -> 2358.07s]  Cabin. Engine. Engine. Cabin. What are the arrows? Where are the arrows? What do you mean? Oh, fuck.
[2358.07s -> 2383.24s]  Use it. Cut the reactor. Look at the reactor. It gets out. Okay.
[2387.90s -> 2393.38s]  I can do that right through here. I'm just gonna cut this whole thing down.
[2393.38s -> 2423.46s]  Okay, so just open up the side and take it right off the fucking exit you make for yourself. Done.
[2424.02s -> 2441.98s]  Okay, cool. Done. It's gonna come out here. Wait, there's another one. Where am I? I can't cut
[2441.98s -> 2448.92s]  through this. Why? What are these? Like batteries in here? It's the hull of this ship. Wait, I have
[2448.92s -> 2459.35s]  to... I need like a good spot to go. I'll just go... Oh, just go through the door.
[2463.94s -> 2504.10s]  Just take it through here. Who cares? Don't put it over there. Put it over here.
[2504.10s -> 2526.34s]  I got it. Into the barge. All right, salvage the nanocarbon. Easy. Can I not open... I can't
[2526.34s -> 2542.49s]  cut through the hull. I can cut through this. It's just the controls. I just broke the controller.
[2544.68s -> 2547.96s]  No, no, no. Get it in the furnace. Get it in the furnace at least. Where did it go?
[2551.22s -> 2566.01s]  Whatever. Cut the yellow? I can't cut any of this. I can't cut it. Let's go back in here.
[2566.01s -> 2573.21s]  Can't cut through nanocarbon. Oh, that's stupid. All right, what do we got in here?
[2574.22s -> 2592.74s]  Oh, look at this. Was this aluminum? Oh, I love aluminum. Let's cut this first. Oh, fuck. Oh,
[2592.74s -> 2597.54s]  fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
[2597.54s -> 2616.76s]  Oh, okay. That goes in the furnace. Does it all go in the furnace? I hope so. Oh, this goes in the
[2616.76s -> 2646.89s]  processor. Hold on. I can take care of this. How'd it happen? No, shit. No, no, no, no, no. Get back
[2646.89s -> 2653.02s]  here. Get back here. Get back here. Okay. Back, back, back, back. I need that processor part.
[2654.65s -> 2658.01s]  I'm going into the fire. I'm going into the fire. All right. I'm going. I'm going to the fire. I
[2658.01s -> 2671.40s]  can't. It's pulling me in. There's a current. Just whatever. So, how do I get the nanocarbon to be?
[2671.40s -> 2676.98s]  I need to... Oh, I have to get it off. Okay. I have to remove it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get
[2676.98s -> 2687.08s]  it. I get it. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Go, go, go, go. All right. Check this
[2687.08s -> 2701.14s]  out. Not that. This. I'm going to get up there. I've got to be ready. I've got to cut this piece
[2701.14s -> 2721.64s]  off of the nanocarbon. Dude. Chuck E. Cheese is here. How do I get this piece out? This goes in
[2721.64s -> 2733.80s]  the processor. They both go in the processor? Okay. Process it, right? Can I just drag it? Okay.
[2733.80s -> 2753.69s]  Tether into here. Can it work? I hope so. Nice. Chuck E. Cheese. Good luck to Chuck.
[2755.85s -> 2763.54s]  How do I pull this off? Oh, shit. Hold on. I'm just going to take the whole thing apart. Who cares?
[2763.54s -> 2778.87s]  Whatever. Let's just go. Just rip it apart. It doesn't matter. Isn't that a Dane Cook movie?
[2778.87s -> 2801.99s]  I have no idea. Nesquik is here. Dude, they're all here. Hold on. This one's floating up. Tether it.
[2802.79s -> 2813.69s]  I don't know. How much more do I need? This is really cool though. I really like this.
[2814.49s -> 2829.51s]  All right. Hold up. Do I salvage everything? Do I salvage everything?
[2830.23s -> 2861.24s]  I'm getting too excited. Okay. Hold on. Stop. Really? What? People happy. Corporate. People
[2861.24s -> 2872.65s]  happy. Corporate. Can I get through here? This is on there pretty tight. No, I can't. Wait.
[2872.65s -> 2892.31s]  Holy shit. What is all this stuff? Cut this off. Taking the whole hull off. Tried to tell you.
[2893.56s -> 2908.76s]  It did. But I didn't listen. Okay. One more. This whole thing's going to fall off.
[2909.40s -> 2917.98s]  This all goes to the processor. Wait. This goes to the barge. Get this shit off. Leave this stuff
[2917.98s -> 2929.50s]  over here. Can I pull shit towards me? What is this? Why is this in here? Get out of here.
[2935.64s -> 2957.83s]  Bank of America. Dude. Bank of America in chat. It's gone. Whatever. Fuck it. This is attached
[2957.83s -> 2976.07s]  by so many things. I hope I can really push this. Chuck E. Cheese just raided the channel.
[2981.32s -> 2994.79s]  Actual Chuck E. Cheese raid. Entertainment is my middle name. No, it's not. It's Edward and we all
[2994.79s -> 3010.52s]  know it. Thanks for the raid. Welcome everybody from Chuck E. Cheese. We're playing. This is a
[3010.52s -> 3019.19s]  salvage game. We salvage materials from a spacecraft and you have to make money and you
[3019.19s -> 3028.89s]  get to carve stuff and slice through the hull. This is it, right? Is it going to happen?
[3029.45s -> 3037.40s]  All right. I kind of, how do I get it up? Can you salvage this stream?
[3042.06s -> 3050.28s]  Quiet, quiet, quiet down. Quiet. Quiet. I'm not going to hear that. I'm not going to hear that
[3050.28s -> 3059.51s]  right now. This whole thing's going to come apart. Are you really going to say that to me in front of
[3059.51s -> 3085.30s]  Charles Entertainment Cheese? How could you? It's still holding this on. It wants to game. New
[3085.30s -> 3103.24s]  streamer friend. It's Chuck E. Cheese. All right. How do I, can I move this? What the fuck is this
[3103.24s -> 3111.94s]  year? I, that's a great question. What do you want to play? Does he talk? Does Chuck E. Cheese talk
[3111.94s -> 3127.11s]  in this universe? You're swearing. Oh, that's, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, plays guitar. No, no. I mean,
[3127.11s -> 3137.00s]  but like it, does he talk on his stream or is it a silent stream? It's important to know. No,
[3137.00s -> 3141.24s]  I don't want to play fall guys. All right. Well, Chuck E. Cheese, well, Chuck E. Cheese play
[3142.04s -> 3147.66s]  like a horror game, a horrible one where like zombies are like attacking us and Chuck E. Cheese
[3147.66s -> 3162.39s]  is like bury an ax in a zombie's head. I haven't gotten my mic set up. What? I'm just asking a
[3162.39s -> 3175.14s]  question. That's all goes processor, right? He said, no, he's a family friendly mascot.
[3176.87s -> 3181.11s]  No, we're just buddies though, right now. You know what I mean? Like, okay, guys, I'm sorry to tell
[3181.11s -> 3196.55s]  you when Chuck E. Cheese takes the mask off, he, he might say the, he might say shit sometimes,
[3196.55s -> 3220.62s]  mask. I'm just saying like a theoretical, like a, like a metaphorical mask. Don't say that. I
[3220.62s -> 3228.42s]  imagine like, I imagine a lot of like, like the Chuck E. Cheese, like eye ups right now going,
[3228.42s -> 3232.34s]  all right, hold on a second. Who, who, who is this guy that we just rated? Okay. What does he,
[3232.34s -> 3234.74s]  what does he do? What does he do? Does he, any family? Does he, does he, does he, does he,
[3234.74s -> 3242.68s]  can he talk about cartoons? Can he talk? What's he saying? Oh shit. What have we done? Why is he
[3242.92s -> 3246.60s]  why does he talk about, why does he talk about his ass? He's talking about eating ass. We have to
[3246.60s -> 3266.49s]  get out of here. Charles, go find a Fortnite streamer quick. No, seriously, thanks. I used to
[3266.49s -> 3275.82s]  love Chuck E. Cheese when I was a kid. My favorite place ever. You know, I can't, I can't think of a
[3275.82s -> 3282.20s]  bad memory I had of Chuck E. Cheese. I really can't. I'd love to tell you that that's fake.
[3283.27s -> 3302.17s]  Always have just good memories from Chuck E. Cheese. Please don't miss. Chuck E. Cheese puke
[3302.17s -> 3305.77s]  story. There's no Chuck E. Cheese puke story. Why would I puke there? They have some of the
[3305.77s -> 3312.95s]  finest cheeses. They have some of the most delicious red sauce on their pizza. What are
[3312.95s -> 3332.28s]  you on about? True. All right. I have to, I, did I do it? What's the hab? Did I get some more? I feel
[3332.28s -> 3339.19s]  like I want more. Not, I don't want, I want one more. Which way is the right way of the ship?
[3341.08s -> 3352.01s]  Yeah, I want a little bit more. What are these attached to? A bunch of nothing. Still in chat.
[3352.57s -> 3363.61s]  Yeah, that's good. Oh, all right. Over here. You think I'm really going to turn down a new
[3363.61s -> 3379.96s]  streamer best friend? That's Chuck E. Cheese. That hurt. I'm sorry. I mean, sorry, kids.
[3380.52s -> 3409.13s]  I'm sorry, kids. More in there. I can't help it. What if Chuck E. Cheese became my best friend?
[3410.01s -> 3421.03s]  Then I would definitely be in a cartoon universe. What is it still attached to?
[3421.83s -> 3444.70s]  I want to just take the whole hole. Yeah. Okay. Now what? A few more over here. I feel like that's
[3444.70s -> 3448.78s]  a conversation I would have with my mother over the phone and she would start to get worried
[3449.66s -> 3455.06s]  and ask me like if everything was like, okay. Hey mom, you wouldn't believe it. My new best
[3455.06s -> 3459.62s]  friend is Chuck E. Cheese. You know, the rat from Chuck E. Cheese. He's coming over tomorrow.
[3462.34s -> 3472.52s]  Okay. Jeremy, how do you feel? How are you feeling right now? That's a like, how are you doing
[3472.52s -> 3487.67s]  conversation that my mother would have? CBD is taking over. There we go. Look at this. I guess.
[3487.67s -> 3493.03s]  Look at all this money. All this money. I'm going to get that tethered together. Let's do a double
[3493.03s -> 3498.25s]  tether right now. Everyone's going to be like, Holy shit. I didn't even think of that. There you go.
[3498.25s -> 3519.05s]  Check it out. Look at that. Tether that too. Tether this too. Take the whole thing. Nice. It'll get
[3519.05s -> 3528.42s]  there. Don't worry. Being friends with Chuck E. Cheese is like a throwaway family guy bit. Yeah,
[3528.42s -> 3546.17s]  but this is real. Oh, no furnace, right? Yeah. Can I take this whole thing now? Yes. Make a giant
[3546.17s -> 3575.11s]  train. Need a little bit more tension over here. How's it breaking? Hold it. Shit. Did I lose it?
[3575.11s -> 3585.46s]  There goes the broom. Whatever. I'm being hosted by Chuck E. Cheese. It just feels so weird to me.
[3586.18s -> 3596.71s]  Does this feel so surreal? This is like some type of weird comedy validation that I'm getting right
[3596.71s -> 3616.39s]  now. Dude, I'm being hosted by Chuck E. Cheese. Man. Nice. It's real. I know. I keep, I see the
[3616.39s -> 3629.18s]  raid. It's ridiculous. Just give me the damn thing. Whatever. All right. I need some tethers,
[3629.18s -> 3632.46s]  tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers.
[3632.46s -> 3645.08s]  I don't know what I'm doing. Freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze the game. Pause. Fuck. It's time
[3645.08s -> 3658.47s]  to wake up, Jeremy. I need to carve this off and not be an idiot. First of all, second of all,
[3660.02s -> 3686.33s]  carve this. Easy. What the? What is it being held on by? Nothing left. There's nothing,
[3686.33s -> 3710.70s]  it's not attached to anything. It's not attached to anything. Oh, gonna work. Carve this shit
[3710.70s -> 3714.86s]  while it's being pulled. Wow. That probably would have killed me if I didn't get out of the way.
[3715.66s -> 3727.90s]  It doesn't mean I get to be in like a Chuck E. Cheese commercial. You know what I mean?
[3731.45s -> 3735.13s]  All right. Can I just, I don't want to do anything. Look, I'll do this for free. I don't even care.
[3736.28s -> 3743.08s]  Can I be the guy that they paint, like there's a lot of quick cuts and it cuts to, like it cuts to
[3743.08s -> 3747.72s]  a guy like me and I've got a bunch of tickets in my hands. There's two pizzas in front of me.
[3748.60s -> 3752.28s]  And there's like three or four other like family members and I've got a bunch of tickets
[3752.36s -> 3757.98s]  and I'm like, like that with like two fistfuls of tickets and there's three
[3757.98s -> 3766.12s]  untouched pizzas in front of me. That's a one, like a two second cut. Can I be, can I go like this?
[3766.12s -> 3772.47s]  Like, can I be like, like looking around for new games? Like it just make, put me somewhere.
[3772.47s -> 3776.15s]  Look, I'll even just give it to you right now. Like you can just use this. Like ready? Like,
[3776.15s -> 3782.54s]  oh, there's new games at Chuck E. Cheese. I'll be like, like I don't use it. I don't care.
[3783.75s -> 3786.95s]  You can literally put it where I do it. You can use it wherever you want.
[3786.95s -> 3794.71s]  Just do it on a green screen. No, it has to be like there, like in my, on my camera.
[3794.71s -> 3811.21s]  Nice and hairy armpits. Somebody, I didn't, I manscaped really recently. So wrong. Use RTX.
[3814.98s -> 3823.30s]  Not the brand. No, the, like the, the term, just because somebody made a product that is called
[3823.30s -> 3832.30s]  manscape, that's the term that existed. Prove it. Show a receipt. A receipt for what?
[3832.62s -> 3848.44s]  What have I done? I'm talking about my, my, by the way, no dust. I'm talking about like,
[3849.86s -> 3854.26s]  I don't, okay. Should I just go to just chatting and just who fucking cares anymore?
[3856.66s -> 3862.34s]  I feel like Chuck E. Cheese has turned this stream like it's not, it's not who cares about
[3862.34s -> 3866.50s]  this video game. Chuck E. Cheese is my best friend now. Like who cares about the game I'm playing.
[3866.50s -> 3886.22s]  Fuck it. Okay. All right. Hold on. I'll be back. Let me just put on, let me just put on underwear.
