[0.31s -> 13.89s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some Counter-Strike Global Offensive.
[13.89s -> 17.89s]  Now, this game is released. It is out. I want to say that very first and foremost.
[17.89s -> 24.89s]  I haven't done a video on CSGO in quite a while, and that's because I was really waiting for this mode to come out.
[24.89s -> 29.89s]  I was waiting for it to come out to retail so I could buy it and play on this map whenever I felt like...
[29.89s -> 35.13s]  Oh, no, sorry, this mode, whenever I felt like it. And this mode is Jailbreak.
[35.13s -> 41.13s]  If you do not know what Jailbreak is, I'm going to give you a very brief synopsis before we cut into some of these goofy moments here.
[41.13s -> 47.13s]  And I have a video coming out in a couple of days that is pretty hysterical. It's me as the warden.
[47.13s -> 51.13s]  But we will get into that later in a couple of days, but I'm going to give you the basics of this mode.
[51.13s -> 57.13s]  I'm going to talk about a little bit why I love it so much, and then we'll get into some goofiness that happened during these playthroughs.
[57.13s -> 64.43s]  So what is Jailbreak? What exactly is going on? What is this game mode all about? And why is it so much fun?
[64.43s -> 71.67s]  First and foremost, Jailbreak is a game mode that pits two sides against each other, but not in the typical sense.
[71.67s -> 77.67s]  You have the prison guards who are there to construct order and to make sure nothing crazy happens.
[77.67s -> 80.67s]  And then you have the prisoners. And then you have the warden.
[80.67s -> 87.67s]  So pretty much there's three different things going on here. You have one guy who is the warden giving orders to all the prisoners.
[87.67s -> 95.67s]  Now, as a prisoner, you can either take these orders and follow the rules and follow the guidelines and survive till the end of the round, maybe.
[95.67s -> 97.67s]  Maybe make a couple of friends while you're at it.
[97.67s -> 102.67s]  But if you do not want to listen to the orders the warden gives you, you do not have to.
[102.67s -> 108.67s]  And that's why it's such a crazy social experiment, because you can start uprisings. You can just attack somebody.
[108.67s -> 112.67s]  You're probably going to die, but it's still fun to see reactions regardless.
[112.67s -> 119.17s]  So if you are playing as a prisoner, if you are on the side with the majority of people, that's where the most people are going to be.
[119.17s -> 126.34s]  Most people are going to be a prisoner. You start with only a knife and you start in a jail cell.
[126.34s -> 129.71s]  Some of these cells are going to have weapons in them.
[129.71s -> 134.71s]  Very, very minor weapons, something like a pistol or a grenade or something like that.
[134.71s -> 137.71s]  And the warden and the prison guards are going to be looking out for that.
[137.71s -> 144.71s]  So you really need to be cautious if you're going to plan on using these items that happen to be spawned in your particular jail cell.
[144.71s -> 148.95s]  So right at the beginning of a round, every single round, this is how every single round plays out,
[148.95s -> 153.95s]  they're either going to give you a free day or they are going to give you specific instructions.
[153.95s -> 158.95s]  Now what a free day is, a free day is they just open the doors and you can do whatever you want.
[158.95s -> 161.95s]  If you happen to attack one of the prison guards, you're going to die.
[161.95s -> 165.95s]  But you don't have to follow any specific instructions during a free day, in quotes.
[166.95s -> 171.45s]  So you're probably asking yourself, Jerma, how the hell is order even kept here?
[171.45s -> 176.45s]  Why don't the prison guards just open fire on everybody and why aren't there trolls everywhere?
[176.45s -> 183.45s]  Now they do exist, but you have to remember these admins are very, very strict about who they allow to play these games.
[183.45s -> 189.45s]  So if you jump into one of these games as a prison guard and you just start unloading on the prisoners for no reason at all,
[189.45s -> 194.45s]  you are going to get permabanned from this server. You're going to get kicked. If you do it again, you're going to get banned.
[194.45s -> 198.45s]  They're very, very proactive about that. So nobody really does it.
[198.45s -> 202.82s]  Usually everybody plays along and tries to fit in their specific role.
[202.82s -> 206.82s]  I, for one, when I play these games, I have such trouble playing as a prisoner.
[206.82s -> 212.82s]  I always try to find a way to sneak away or try to get a gun and shoot one of the prison guards.
[212.82s -> 218.82s]  It's so much fun trying to find different things to do because there's all kinds of little hidden areas you can find your way into.
[218.82s -> 223.82s]  It's so much fun, guys, and I highly recommend you jump into a jailbreak server.
[223.82s -> 228.82s]  Whether if you're going to try and play as the warden and give instructions and keep order or play as a prisoner
[228.82s -> 234.82s]  and either follow the directions and play till the end and try and last till the very end or try to start an uprising.
[234.82s -> 240.82s]  It's just a great experiment, guys, and please, please, please go find some servers that play jailbreak.
[240.82s -> 244.82s]  There's only about a handful of them, though, so you got to really look for them.
[244.82s -> 251.50s]  So that is going to wrap up my post commentary here. I'm going to cut to a couple of funny moments in the next couple of minutes.
[251.50s -> 258.50s]  So sit back, relax and enjoy the jailbreak, guys, and look forward in the next couple of days to Jerma the warden.
[258.50s -> 264.09s]  And I'll leave it at that. And of course, take care, everybody.
[264.09s -> 269.42s]  What did he say? What did you say?
[269.42s -> 276.74s]  Another free day. Free day. He said come within five feet and we get shot.
[276.74s -> 281.74s]  There's a sniper rifle just sitting right here. I want that sniper rifle.
[281.74s -> 284.74s]  Oh, Tio, Tio, Tio got it.
[293.36s -> 294.36s]  Jerma, do it.
[294.36s -> 299.36s]  No, dude, there's four of them just sitting here pointing at me. I'll never get out in time.
[299.36s -> 302.36s]  As soon as he does, hell will break loose.
[302.36s -> 304.36s]  Spoon, are you still alive?
[304.36s -> 307.36s]  No, I said I'm free and ran away and died.
[307.36s -> 311.36s]  I'm just waiting for an opportunity to try and grab that and run out of the room.
[313.36s -> 315.36s]  I'm just staring.
[316.36s -> 318.36s]  Oh, he just made it easier.
[318.36s -> 320.36s]  I got it. I got it.
[320.36s -> 326.11s]  CT's on the top floor. I want you to walk towards the end, walk down the stairs and join your buddies.
[326.11s -> 329.11s]  Walk down the stairs. Are these the stairs?
[329.11s -> 331.11s]  Why are you shooting me?
[331.11s -> 333.98s]  No free killing, guys.
[333.98s -> 336.98s]  Oh, I got an opportunity to knife this guy right in the back.
[336.98s -> 339.98s]  Oh, no, I've been doing way too much of that.
[340.98s -> 343.47s]  Face the wall.
[343.47s -> 345.47s]  Are we playing Red Rover?
[345.47s -> 348.08s]  We sure are.
[348.08s -> 351.08s]  Someone go up there and check to make sure there's no one left up there.
[352.38s -> 354.38s]  This is so scary.
[355.38s -> 357.38s]  I'm getting so fucking stupid.
[357.38s -> 359.38s]  Oh shit, what is this?
[359.38s -> 361.38s]  First reaction, last reaction.
[361.38s -> 363.38s]  I forget how this works.
[365.71s -> 368.71s]  I think it's the first person to do something.
[368.71s -> 371.89s]  I hope you guys know the rules, CT's.
[371.89s -> 375.71s]  Explain the rules, please.
[375.71s -> 378.71s]  First reaction, the first person to do something gets killed.
[378.71s -> 381.71s]  If I call last reaction, the last person to do it gets killed.
[381.71s -> 383.71s]  Okay, thank you.
[406.27s -> 408.27s]  What is going on?
[408.27s -> 410.27s]  Where's the gun? Where's the gun?
[412.96s -> 414.96s]  Don't shoot, don't shoot.
[414.96s -> 417.52s]  All right, all right, guys.
[417.52s -> 419.52s]  We're going to start playing now.
[421.52s -> 423.52s]  Fuck everybody!
[426.52s -> 428.52s]  Dude, there's only like three people alive.
[430.52s -> 432.52s]  What?
[436.98s -> 438.98s]  I got given a grenade. Should I throw it away?
[438.98s -> 441.47s]  Throw it in yourself, please.
[441.47s -> 443.47s]  Don't kill him, don't kill him.
[443.47s -> 445.47s]  Don't kill him, don't kill him.
[445.47s -> 447.65s]  Don't kill him.
[447.65s -> 449.65s]  I did it.
[449.65s -> 451.65s]  Oh, what the hell?
[451.65s -> 453.65s]  What the fuck did you kill him for?
[453.65s -> 455.65s]  He killed me.
[455.65s -> 457.65s]  Son of a bitch.
[457.65s -> 459.65s]  Don't pick up his gun.
[459.65s -> 461.65s]  Dude, he's giving me the gun.
[461.65s -> 463.65s]  He just gave me the gun.
[463.65s -> 465.65s]  Go drop it, go drop it.
[465.65s -> 467.65s]  Did he steal the gun away?
[467.65s -> 469.65s]  What are you...
[469.65s -> 472.78s]  I don't know.
[477.34s -> 479.34s]  Dude, the guy walked over and threw the gun at me.
[479.34s -> 481.34s]  He was like planting it on me.
[481.34s -> 483.58s]  Did I have a grenade or something?
