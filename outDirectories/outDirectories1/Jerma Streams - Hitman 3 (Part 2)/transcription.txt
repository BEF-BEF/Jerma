[1.85s -> 10.66s]  Hello. He forgot to talk. No, no, all right, all right, all right. Listen, listen, listen.
[13.32s -> 22.62s]  He's very early. I'm like seven minutes early. Somebody said, were you, were you all right at
[22.62s -> 32.41s]  the end of yesterday's stream? Yeah? Yeah, what, what do you mean? At the end of the stream? What
[32.41s -> 47.35s]  happened? What happened at the end of last night's stream? I don't know, what is the person talking
[47.35s -> 56.68s]  about? He forgets. Jesus, this is bad. Wait, wait, didn't I scream because, wait, didn't we raid
[56.68s -> 60.98s]  somebody? Did we raid somebody and I like screamed because I ran out of time? Is that what you're
[60.98s -> 65.74s]  talking about? What happened? We didn't raid anybody last night, did we? Yes, we did. We raided
[65.74s -> 82.87s]  Ludwig. Anyways, oh, by the way, I was there for Ludwig's raid song. It was fucking pretty good.
[84.25s -> 86.89s]  You guys just make everybody do the raid song. He's sitting there like,
[88.52s -> 91.48s]  like do the raid song, do the raid song. Keep seeing. He's like, what is the raid song? He said,
[91.48s -> 94.76s]  we don't have a raid song. You're just confusing the absolute fuck out of him.
[95.32s -> 100.33s]  And on the spot, he just turned on a little music file and he did a song better than anything I
[100.33s -> 110.12s]  could have ever done. Do the raid song. You're just going to confuse everybody we ever raid.
[116.82s -> 125.51s]  We're raiding you right now. No, you're not. Yeah, I think everybody we've raided has had
[125.51s -> 134.18s]  to do a raid song. You guys can't just force people to do a raid song. Anyways, tonight we're
[134.18s -> 141.38s]  going to play Hitman 3. I'm very scared to open up the save file because I'm going to be very
[141.38s -> 147.64s]  honest with you. This third level, I'm just going to kill them and run to the exit. I don't like
[147.64s -> 152.86s]  this place. I'm going to just find the people. I'm going to kill them and run and like save state
[152.86s -> 160.52s]  and run out of the level. I think we also had a thing today, which I want to go over.
[162.46s -> 169.46s]  It was about maybe playing Hitman while a little bit high, right? And while I think that's a fun
[169.46s -> 176.76s]  idea, I want to make sure I let you guys know this. There's going to be no debt wiping today.
[178.18s -> 181.70s]  This is not going to do any debt. This is not for any reason in particular.
[182.60s -> 194.25s]  I don't want to incentivize like doing drugs on stream for a benefit. So if I'm going to do
[194.25s -> 200.95s]  anything, it's going to be because I just feel like it. I do it sometimes, but no, I don't really
[200.95s -> 205.99s]  like the idea of incentivizing me doing drugs. I don't think that's cool. I think that's not a
[205.99s -> 213.02s]  good way to, I think that's not a good start to like doing something like this. So cause like,
[213.02s -> 218.22s]  oh, hey, hey, hey, dude, 500 million. If you get high right now, wait, right now. Okay. Yeah.
[219.18s -> 224.46s]  No, that's not going to happen. So there's no incentive here. If I'm going to do it today,
[224.46s -> 232.31s]  I'm going to do it for fun. And that's it. So there's no, don't, there's no debt wipes or
[232.31s -> 244.47s]  anything like that. Pull, pull out the what you've bong rips. No, no, no. And I'm not going to do
[244.47s -> 251.32s]  that. I look, Hitman is a very complicated game. And I know a ton of you guys are going to laugh
[251.32s -> 256.47s]  and be like, no, it isn't. You just have to go strangle people with piano wire. I know, I know
[256.47s -> 262.55s]  it's not, it's, but it is this, okay. If there's more than like a hundred people in a room and I
[262.55s -> 267.43s]  have an apple in my hand and all the people in that room can get hit in the face by an apple,
[267.43s -> 279.38s]  it's incredibly complicated. There's too many, the flow chart is all over the place. So we're
[279.38s -> 285.86s]  going to try to do this level that I, I don't, dude, I don't remember. It was, I just walked
[285.86s -> 290.10s]  around in the circle for 20 minutes and said, I hate this. I hate this place. I hate cement. Delete
[290.10s -> 296.07s]  this level. And I couldn't figure out how to get back to the dance floor. So I'm just going to
[296.07s -> 301.74s]  really try to beat this level because I want to see the rest of the game. You're no longer family
[301.74s -> 306.62s]  friendly. It's, you got to click the 18 plus mature audience warning. How many times do I have to say
[306.62s -> 313.86s]  that? How many times do I have to say that? This is a mature audience stream. We talk about mature
[313.86s -> 320.73s]  things here, like your favorite Yoshi character. Mine's definitely
[321.69s -> 335.26s]  Oshi. All right, let's go. You hit the beat. All right. I have to be ready for this. I was,
[335.26s -> 341.74s]  I got to, I'm trying to look the best pitchers in the major leagues. If they let up a home run,
[341.74s -> 346.89s]  or they let up 10 runs and they have to pitch two days later, the last one didn't even happen. You
[346.89s -> 355.94s]  got to delete it from your memory. Didn't even happen. So that last stream didn't happen.
[356.58s -> 361.48s]  All right. Here we go. So like, I'm ready. I'm ready to pitch. I'm ready to pitch right now.
[361.48s -> 365.56s]  I'm ready to pitch. I got to kill that guy over there. Gun, uh, with the gun, gun, gun.
[366.90s -> 374.33s]  This is really loud. Hold on. Spoilers. This is level three. Yeah. We're playing hitman three,
[374.33s -> 383.90s]  level three. Are you high already? No. All right. Hitman three, level three. I'm currently the DJ.
[384.86s -> 393.38s]  Poison. Those look pretty good. What's going on here? What's wrong with my computer? All right.
[393.38s -> 397.24s]  No, don't go into this. Don't go. Don't go into the cement yet. All right. Who'd I kill?
[400.18s -> 411.02s]  Kill somebody who died. Did I, somebody died? Somebody just walk off a cliff. Okay. All right.
[411.02s -> 413.42s]  Where are you? Where? Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to kill that guy over there.
[414.34s -> 421.56s]  David. Somebody died. Perfect. Holy shit. That's fucking unbelievable. All right. Thank God.
[422.12s -> 426.38s]  I only have to kill. I don't even know how many more people will. Let's go. What do I have for
[426.38s -> 431.69s]  weapons? I don't have any weapons. Do I? Oh, yes, I do. All right. I'm going to syringe somebody in
[431.69s -> 444.25s]  the neck. That's very important. I want to go. He's so good. Let's go get this guy over here.
[444.25s -> 450.46s]  I want to syringe this part. Put the syringe away. Wait, I thought I'm going to, I'm not allowed
[450.46s -> 461.98s]  in here. Is he going to be mad that I try to come in? Tech only. Brown this guy and froth. All right.
[461.98s -> 483.77s]  Hold on. There he is. I played cool. Intel. What? You want to bench press me? What the fuck? That
[483.85s -> 494.94s]  was Intel. Actually just kill. What do you think I'm trying to do? Okay. I'm going to follow this guy
[494.94s -> 505.50s]  around. That's the guy I have to kill. I'm going to syringe him in the neck and I'm going to step
[505.50s -> 510.30s]  on his head. This person is going to fight me. Look at this person walking up to me like they're
[510.30s -> 523.90s]  going to punch me in the face. Get away from me. Where are you going? Okay. So I can't do it on the
[523.90s -> 528.92s]  dance floor. Does he like go to the bathroom over here? All right. He goes in here. Who else is in
[528.92s -> 535.69s]  there? There's some tech people in there. Wait, that's two of these guys to get. Oh shit. Hold on.
[536.25s -> 543.14s]  They come in this little staff room. Can I go in that? Maybe I can go. Okay. I'm going to go kill
[543.14s -> 548.26s]  people in the staff room first. What do you think? That's probably a good idea. Does he walk this way
[548.26s -> 555.22s]  or that way? God damn it. I hate this place. I'm really thinking about just going for stabbing
[555.22s -> 557.78s]  him in the neck and then running and stabbing the other guy in the neck and then killing the other
[557.78s -> 573.43s]  guy and then stabbing. I just want to kill both these guys right now. Shut up. Does he only walk?
[573.43s -> 580.15s]  All right. I need to get in this. Can I sneak around him? All right. He goes in here. His path
[580.15s -> 595.21s]  goes in here. What's in here? I need a key card. The DJ is just following a guy around.
[595.77s -> 607.45s]  There has to be a creative way I can kill this guy, right? I'm going to syringe him in the neck
[607.45s -> 611.03s]  and run. What else am I going to do? I don't know. Look, I know there's probably an elaborate way.
[617.35s -> 627.70s]  Just do it and run. I just want to see if this guy's path is just a circle on the dance floor
[627.70s -> 635.82s]  because if it is, then we have to drop a chandelier on his head. That's the one thing I wasn't doing
[635.82s -> 640.12s]  last time. I wasn't following their individual paths around. Where's he going? Okay. There he
[640.12s -> 650.71s]  goes. Where's this at? Where's this at? Where's this at? Opportunity coming up. Probably right
[650.71s -> 659.11s]  here. I should have done it right there. Oh my God. Can I throw a beer bottle?
[660.54s -> 668.50s]  Fuck. Are you talking about? God damn it, dude. Really? Shut up. Don't point. Don't point. Hide
[668.50s -> 677.77s]  and seek. Don't point at me. How could you? You don't know that I'm the DJ. I'm the DJ.
[678.73s -> 682.65s]  You want to? You're going to? That's just random guy here is the guy that you're going to
[682.65s -> 686.57s]  give information to. You came here to see me tonight. Don't you want to make me happy?
[688.98s -> 723.19s]  He's dead. Here's the broom. Who's shooting? I'm just going to go fucking kill this guy. I'm
[723.19s -> 726.31s]  just going to go syringe him. I don't care. I don't like this level. I don't. I don't like
[726.31s -> 748.89s]  this level. I'm just going to go syringe him. Who is this? Is that one of them? How could?
[748.89s -> 763.54s]  Oh my fucking God. I hate this level. Where is it? Right here? Just use a gun. I don't have
[763.54s -> 780.95s]  a gun. The syringe doesn't kill them. I'm just going to fucking sprint. I'm allowed to be here.
[780.95s -> 796.82s]  I'm the DJ. What do you mean? What am I doing back here? This is my set. You're on my set.
[797.54s -> 813.64s]  What do you mean they see through you? They see 3PO. What? They see through you.
[817.96s -> 821.72s]  Hey, what are you doing back here? You're not supposed to be back here. Oh, by the way,
[821.72s -> 830.34s]  I loved the last song you played. You'll be paying me in the parking lot, right?
[830.34s -> 860.38s]  Oh, I did it again. Oh my God. I hate this level. I have to beat this level.
[861.69s -> 874.52s]  I hate this place. Where's my opportunities? I don't have any intel. I need my intel.
[878.46s -> 884.52s]  There's no good things to do. I just have to follow these people around and then kill them.
[884.52s -> 899.24s]  There's like 3,000 people here. Entitled streamer needs his intel. Where's my intel?
[900.28s -> 907.80s]  You know what? I'm going to go after that guy up there. Fuck this.
[911.67s -> 914.31s]  Where are the opportunities? No, there's no opportunities because this is not like an
[914.31s -> 919.58s]  assassin mission. This is just going to avoid the red guy but kill the red guy.
[921.93s -> 937.82s]  There's no assassination here. I'm going up there. All right. I'm going to go up. I'm
[937.82s -> 945.42s]  going to wait for his path to go up that way. Why are you already mad? I hate this level.
[949.94s -> 959.56s]  This guy's got a bodyguard with him too. All right. You know what? Do I have any grenades?
[959.56s -> 967.18s]  I'm throwing a grenade in that room. He's going to come through here. Hold on. This
[967.18s -> 970.50s]  is my opportunity right here. I'm going to save it right here. Watch this shit.
[970.50s -> 1001.62s]  I'm going to get one right here. Come on. Walk through here. He's zonked and naked.
[1001.62s -> 1018.81s]  Does he take a right or take a left? I think he takes a right. Here he comes.
[1018.81s -> 1037.05s]  Where's my intel? I need that. Look, I know. I'm one of those... Wait, this guy's number six,
[1037.05s -> 1046.36s]  but I'm not allowed to be... Wait a minute. Do they like me now? No. Put that back on.
[1046.36s -> 1051.40s]  Look, I know. I'm one of those people that I'm playing hitman. You got to play it the real way.
[1051.40s -> 1057.96s]  You know, you can't have any intel, no blue markers on the map, but I'm sorry. I need those.
[1058.68s -> 1063.45s]  I need you to show me where the thing to drop the chandelier is. I need it.
[1064.09s -> 1071.86s]  Let me go up. They just walk up and round a circle. All right. This guy's dead.
[1073.42s -> 1077.42s]  I'm going to cut this guy off in the concrete up here, and I'm going to kill him.
[1077.42s -> 1086.07s]  Could I disguise as somebody else that he trusts or something and lure him away or take him
[1086.07s -> 1093.11s]  somewhere or do something? I feel like I don't have anything to do. There was the electrocute
[1093.11s -> 1109.82s]  the guy with the tree. What are the things going to do to these guys? They just walk around up
[1109.82s -> 1119.34s]  here. All right. I might be able to kill him over there. I can come back here. Yeah. That's the
[1119.98s -> 1125.10s]  play. The play here is I'm going to brick. Okay. This is the play. I got it. These two guys walk
[1125.10s -> 1128.30s]  down here. I'm going to wait. They're going to cycle over here. I'm going to hide right here.
[1128.30s -> 1133.27s]  I'm going to brick the first guy and I'm going to punch him. What will kill them? Definitely.
[1133.27s -> 1136.71s]  Crowbar? A knife. All right. I'm going to stab him. I'm going to stab him in the head.
[1151.06s -> 1156.76s]  Did they walk back this way? If they do, I'll hide over here. I just don't want these techs to see
[1156.76s -> 1171.56s]  this. He's definitely ADHD. Too much to wait that long. Oh, I don't like this. I like the 47. This
[1171.56s -> 1179.85s]  is Diana here. Here we have a Bingleberry Tingleberry, an oil rig, a machinery extraordinaire.
[1179.85s -> 1184.25s]  He's welled up in his panta. I don't want to just wait around and follow the fucking red outline guy.
[1184.25s -> 1198.49s]  No, I hate this. I don't like this level. Just go kill them. I tried that. Every single person in
[1198.49s -> 1213.02s]  this dance floor has a gun. They just start firing at me. I really might be too ADHD to wait this
[1213.02s -> 1221.35s]  long. I have to wait this long. Kill one and take their gun. That's the plan. The plan is when this
[1221.35s -> 1225.43s]  guy dies, I'm going to stab him in the throat. No, first of all, I have two of these. I'm going
[1225.43s -> 1230.34s]  to throw the knife into his face and then kill his partner. I'm going to take his gun. I'm going to
[1230.34s -> 1232.74s]  lean over the edge. I'm going to shoot that guy in the fucking head and then I'm going to go to the
[1232.74s -> 1248.86s]  exit. This is going to take so long. In fact, I could probably just do this right now. Can I reach
[1248.86s -> 1254.98s]  from here? Wait, can I reach from here? Nobody will know what it is. Nobody will know if I can
[1254.98s -> 1267.35s]  get it from here. No, it does not. Okay. All right. Here they come. Where are they? Where do you go?
[1267.43s -> 1278.81s]  There he is. Okay. I'm ready. I'm going to be ready for the save it so I don't fuck this up.
[1278.81s -> 1285.56s]  There are five guards. No, there's not. There's four. Wouldn't I have found the other one by now?
[1285.56s -> 1289.48s]  If there's a fifth guard, if I have to walk around and just stand next to people until
[1289.48s -> 1295.21s]  one of them puts a thing on their ear, I'm not going to be happy at all.
[1295.21s -> 1310.57s]  There are five. Great. Got to get up here already. This is awful gameplay. I don't, I look, this is
[1310.57s -> 1317.78s]  probably the worst hitman gameplay you're ever going to see. You could put a headset on your dog
[1317.78s -> 1325.05s]  and put the mouse on their paw and then put a treat in the air and the movement from the tail
[1325.05s -> 1332.36s]  wagging, the moving, and their paws going back and forth would probably kill both these guys.
[1332.36s -> 1342.39s]  All right. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait a minute. Is he alone? They're both
[1342.39s -> 1348.18s]  coming up here. Can I get a double? Here we go. Here we go. This is important. I got two of these.
[1348.18s -> 1352.15s]  I'm going to throw one in his head. Let Otto play. Hey, tiger. Thanks for the vibe. Give me
[1352.15s -> 1361.16s]  it or these apps. You're just standing there. Yeah, I'm being an assassin. Assassins wait for
[1361.16s -> 1373.80s]  their prey. Come on. Just walk down here. This is a nice concrete stream. Don't even get me
[1373.80s -> 1384.04s]  started on that concrete. Where is he? Why is he walking that way? They're going to come this way.
[1384.04s -> 1391.67s]  You're a camper. I have to get out of this level. I did. I need to beat this level because if I skip
[1391.67s -> 1400.49s]  this level, like a lot of people have said, then I didn't beat hitman three. Here they come. Don't
[1400.49s -> 1410.70s]  walk all the way down. Take a right. There we go. Okay. Here we go. You play the other games. You
[1410.70s -> 1413.58s]  should know how to play this one. This is the first time they've done a mission like this
[1413.58s -> 1418.18s]  where there's no target. You just have to like wait around and like fucking kill the guy.
[1418.18s -> 1432.66s]  I'm ready. This is it. Are you ready? First time. Here we go. First try. One, two. Who? What? Who is
[1432.66s -> 1459.75s]  it? Get off. Get off cover. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Where is he? No. Did anybody hear the shot?
[1459.75s -> 1493.98s]  No. Nobody else come up here. What? He was two people. He just dead ringered. Kill that spy.
[1500.66s -> 1512.95s]  I'm done. I'm done. I'm skipping the level. I'm skipping the level. Why did he hear it? He
[1512.95s -> 1531.00s]  shouldn't have heard it. That was so stupid. You got face stabbed. Okay. Well, obviously they see
[1531.00s -> 1537.85s]  this, so I need to move. I have to wait even a little longer. This is surprising if this guy's
[1537.85s -> 1582.94s]  standing here, right? Don't shoot. Who found it? Oh my God. I hate this place. You fucking suck.
[1582.94s -> 1587.90s]  Stop saying that. It's making me unconscious. It's making me self-conscious. Stop saying that.
[1587.90s -> 1607.26s]  I need to move. Hold on. Here's the play. Here's the play. Here's the play. Ready?
[1607.26s -> 1615.54s]  Will he see me or is he stupid? He's too dumb, right? Too dumb. No. I want to stab him with the
[1615.54s -> 1636.01s]  fucking syringe. What are you doing? Oh my God. No, no, no, no, no. He's arresting me.
[1636.73s -> 1675.21s]  I'm being arrested. Oh shit. I'm being arrested. All right. I'm good. Eliminate agents too.
[1676.86s -> 1686.73s]  That guy's fucking alive. What do you mean? He's alive. He's alive. He's not alive. Oh my God.
[1686.73s -> 1693.83s]  He's alive. No, no, no, no, no. I didn't take his knife. Oh my fucking God. Are you kidding me?
[1709.62s -> 1728.14s]  Get the fuck out of here. Leave. What the fuck? Oh shit. I have to hide in the locker.
[1728.94s -> 1732.62s]  Is there a locker over here? Oh my God. I'm in so much trouble. I'm in so much trouble.
[1733.34s -> 1755.43s]  Oh my God. He has to die. That guy has to die right now. No one will hear it, right?
[1773.37s -> 1781.03s]  No, no, no. That guy has to die. That guy has to die. No, this guy has to die. He's fucking naked.
[1785.51s -> 1788.95s]  No, the other guy. The other guy. The other guy. The other guy. The other guy. The other guy.
[1788.95s -> 1818.98s]  There he is. Thank you. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. I need new clothes. Montgomery Burns?
[1819.62s -> 1840.26s]  Wait, we're clearing the place out. Get back in here. Get in here. Come in here. Thank you.
[1840.26s -> 1845.27s]  Oh my God. Why did you open that fucking door? Why did you open that door? Why did you open
[1845.27s -> 1849.43s]  this door? You're supposed to be clearing out the facility, not opening doors to like staff rooms.
[1849.43s -> 1871.29s]  I need a new clothes. Just evacuate. I'm compromised. I need new clothes. Everybody
[1871.29s -> 1887.80s]  knows me. Ow. Every single person here knows who I am now. This is like Batman dropping down with
[1887.80s -> 1902.15s]  the Batman costume on. Oh, I'm fucking in tons of trouble here. I think I'm in... I just messed
[1902.15s -> 1909.61s]  everything up. I have nowhere to go. I just blew it so bad. I can't go anywhere. Can I stand up and
[1909.61s -> 1924.87s]  grab that? Stand up. Why can I not stand up? Just go and kill. I... All right. I can't even stand up.
[1924.87s -> 1935.50s]  Whatever. I don't care. Save it here. I think I'm all right. Holy shit. Nobody saw. All right. Good,
[1935.50s -> 1945.29s]  good, good, good, good. I got two tech people down there. There's one dude over there. Oh,
[1945.29s -> 1957.53s]  nice. Okay. Who's here? Okay. Perfect. There's no one else in this room. I need to lure these two
[1957.53s -> 2031.34s]  over. I don't even... I don't have no idea. Wait. That's... There he is. Oh, no. What? I didn't even
[2031.34s -> 2057.58s]  put him on. I have to find the last person. I have to find the last person. Intel. The drug dealer
[2057.58s -> 2062.92s]  is apparently supplying some of the staff and security... Where was this? I can't follow that.
[2062.92s -> 2078.28s]  Where's my blue marker for that? Wait. Is that right below me? Is that the drug dealer right
[2078.28s -> 2088.90s]  there? Where's the drug dealer? It's my Intel. Drug dealer. He's got a red hat on. There he is.
[2088.90s -> 2095.18s]  Oh, God. That's the drug dealer. Okay. I need a new costume. Follow that guy. Follow the guy in
[2095.18s -> 2128.38s]  the red hat. Save it here. Follow that guy in the red hat. There he is. Where's he going? Destroy
[2128.38s -> 2135.80s]  that guy. I need a new outfit. This one's already compromised. I have to lure... Oh, you up there.
[2135.80s -> 2139.99s]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
[2139.99s -> 2143.69s]  Get him. Get this motherfucker right now before he goes upstairs. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Get him,
[2143.69s -> 2145.85s]  get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him.
[2145.85s -> 2171.46s]  I want to follow... I want to do a mission. Follow the drug dealer. There he is. Okay. There's somebody
[2171.46s -> 2176.76s]  in here does not know... Can see right through me. He's not in the room though. Okay. What's going on
[2176.76s -> 2190.02s]  here with these drugs? Apparently busy. I was getting killed by a derma in Team Fortress 2
[2190.02s -> 2198.52s]  last night. Was it you? What happened? Am I searching what? What do you mean searching?
[2199.32s -> 2216.10s]  I don't understand. Searching for what? Okay. How many fucking times? He's still alive?
[2216.74s -> 2236.02s]  Where's this last person? Look at the link, please. Literally just you're in a bad trip. I'm fine.
[2236.02s -> 2249.05s]  Look at it. Look at it. Mission stories. Just click this. Oh, my God, derma. What? Hold on.
[2249.05s -> 2261.32s]  What do you mean? Just click this. Just click this. Mission stories. The game's like crashing.
[2261.32s -> 2276.09s]  Mission stories. Not available for this mission. It's a really good game. It's a really good...
[2276.09s -> 2286.70s]  Where's this last person? It's probably you. Is it you? I don't care if I get a zero in
[2286.70s -> 2302.62s]  this mission. I don't care. Where'd he go? Where'd you go? What? Did they find this body?
[2302.62s -> 2314.90s]  Who found this body? It said searching. Does he turn around and come down here? Let's find out.
[2323.46s -> 2327.32s]  Why did it say searching? I shot someone. No, no, no. When I went to the drug dealer,
[2327.32s -> 2333.56s]  it said, oh, searching now. I didn't do anything. He got scared. I think somebody comes up these
[2333.56s -> 2353.54s]  stairs and sees him. Okay. Found him. Found him. I just karate chopped his neck. Okay. I think I'm
[2353.54s -> 2377.94s]  in a clear now. Talk to the drug dealer. Drug dealer. Hi. What's up? Ask about buying drugs.
[2380.55s -> 2387.86s]  Follow me. I can't go that way. I can't. Can we go a different way? Can we go a different way? I
[2387.86s -> 2396.50s]  can't go... I know somebody here. I don't want them to see me here. I don't want them to see
[2396.50s -> 2402.50s]  we went to the same club on the same night. I literally texted this person that I wasn't
[2402.50s -> 2407.14s]  around tonight, that I had family in town. Okay. So fucking come on. Can we go a different way?
[2420.66s -> 2455.18s]  Thanks. How do I syringe him? What's wrong with him? Why is he not falling down? This guy,
[2455.18s -> 2462.47s]  I think this guy does a lot of drugs. So like, it's not going to make him fall down. I think
[2462.47s -> 2481.86s]  he'll be okay in like five minutes. I can't kill. I feel kind of like, I can't hurt this guy.
[2510.22s -> 2514.06s]  How did I break it? I just stabbed him and I was trying to take his clothes.
[2524.33s -> 2530.30s]  He's stupid. I wanted to subdue him so I could take his clothes and hide his body because I'm
[2530.30s -> 2533.82s]  the drug dealer now and I can go to one of the staff members with the drugs. He was sitting there
[2533.82s -> 2545.37s]  going... The game was glitched. I couldn't even get out of it. So I had to shoot the guy. I gave
[2545.37s -> 2568.07s]  that plenty of time for that to work itself out and it didn't. So I had to shoot him. I had to.
[2574.01s -> 2578.46s]  Don't sell me the drugs right here. What are you stupid? Can I save it here? Okay. Thank God.
[2578.54s -> 2583.29s]  Oh, Richard Nixon impression. Sure.
[2588.73s -> 2596.87s]  There. That'll be a thousand dollars. In joke currency, fake money. Not real money.
[2596.87s -> 2614.62s]  Why does he drop it on the ground? You notice that? So give it to me. Oh, right. He wants money.
[2618.65s -> 2634.65s]  That's what I wanted to have happen last time. Get silent. Somebody will hear me if I stab him.
[2639.30s -> 2643.54s]  Okay. I'm now the drug dealer. So now I have to walk up to one of these guys and sell drugs to him.
[2644.10s -> 2654.20s]  Okay. Which one of these guys does the drugs? Let's see if it's you.
[2667.32s -> 2673.51s]  I have something for you. You might like... You think that... Why wouldn't he? He should put on
[2673.51s -> 2680.78s]  like a... Put a voice on, right? 47 never puts a voice on. Every time you disguise, he's just like,
[2680.78s -> 2686.15s]  yes, I'm here. The chef ready to serve you. You think if he was an assassin like that,
[2686.15s -> 2692.82s]  why wouldn't you put a voice on? Put a voice on. Okay. And would you like some drugs?
[2694.30s -> 2699.40s]  Why do I have to just speak my normal voice? This guy doesn't want any drugs, I don't think.
[2711.11s -> 2716.38s]  At some point, I've never been recorded. And if I'm the most incredible assassin in the world,
[2717.10s -> 2721.82s]  nobody picked me up. I'm like a microphone in an office complex being like,
[2721.82s -> 2727.64s]  the job is done. I just blew it. I got too close. I was talking.
[2727.64s -> 2751.59s]  The game crashed. It's a hard crash. I have to... Oh, god damn it. Okay.
[2761.35s -> 2779.08s]  Oops. I think that was just... You just walked directly in front.
[2780.28s -> 2783.32s]  I was so quick that you wouldn't even be able to avoid it if you wanted to.
[2786.66s -> 2794.01s]  Did that person lean in? Was that person over my shoulder with a stretched out neck being like,
[2794.01s -> 2798.17s]  hey, what's happening over here? Like Beetlejuice style? Like a long neck?
[2798.89s -> 2812.20s]  Hey, yeah. Whoa. Bang. Like, I don't understand. Watch the clip. The hitscan was behind you. What?
[2817.16s -> 2822.25s]  No, hold on. I actually do want to see how this happened. At some point...
[2823.05s -> 2848.73s]  Let's see. See how this played out. Okay. Let's see. So, I'm walking around.
[2850.44s -> 2854.12s]  Like, at some point, I've never been recorded. And if I'm the most
[2854.68s -> 2860.04s]  incredible assassin in the world, nobody picked me up. I'm like a microphone in an
[2860.04s -> 2866.26s]  office complex being like, the job is done. I just blew it. Who is this person?
[2866.26s -> 2868.82s]  I got too close. I don't see... It was a lady, right? Is this lady right here?
[2872.60s -> 2877.80s]  What happened? What? I just blew it. I got too close. I was talking.
[2878.92s -> 2884.98s]  There she is. She walks forward. The gun is out. The gun is in front of me.
[2885.62s -> 2891.51s]  And I shoot her directly in the head. It's like I held the gun up and pointed my wrist
[2891.51s -> 2899.86s]  backwards and just blew her head off. What? I got too close. I was talking.
[2899.86s -> 2903.30s]  This is one of those scenarios where this is the assassin behind me.
[2903.30s -> 2906.74s]  And this is just a big show with this guy in front of me.
[2906.74s -> 2917.80s]  She's coming up to kill me. Wrist back kill. The bullet is from the camera.
[2917.80s -> 2928.70s]  Third person game. Let's go. Let me turn it up too. It's a little low.
[2928.70s -> 2938.74s]  The hitscan is from the camera. Well, I guess we figured that out.
[2939.38s -> 2943.62s]  Where's the save point? 17 right here. Where is it? Yeah.
[2955.00s -> 2961.56s]  Hmm. This game is zonked. When are you going to get high?
[2963.27s -> 2968.79s]  Look, relax. When am I going to... Hey, I'm only here for the guy to get high.
[2970.26s -> 2973.22s]  Yeah. I mean, I heard that this dude was going to just get high today.
[2973.94s -> 2978.07s]  That's the only reason why I showed up. Wait. Why does the guy have a...
[2978.07s -> 2991.43s]  The drug dealer has a key card? I may or may not be currently partaking.
[2991.43s -> 2995.11s]  You don't know. And I'm doing it on my own for my own amusement.
[2995.11s -> 3004.25s]  What is even back here? Okay. So this dude right here does not care about drugs
[3004.25s -> 3008.49s]  because he literally... I followed him around for a minute or two.
[3008.49s -> 3013.42s]  Okay. I can't unlock this door. Yes, I can. Oh, no, I can't.
[3016.74s -> 3020.02s]  Let me guess. The person that wants the drugs is somebody I've already killed.
[3020.02s -> 3026.44s]  Let me guess. We get to do the fun thing where we now walk around in circles until somebody goes,
[3027.64s -> 3033.66s]  yeah, I'm looking for him. I don't see him. Out of the 5,000 people here.
[3042.17s -> 3052.74s]  Why are you dressed up as Paddington Bear? I don't know, man.
[3055.69s -> 3057.53s]  Okay. So I don't think it's anybody else on the dance floor.
[3062.25s -> 3066.10s]  We're looking for a girl. The fifth agent is a girl.
[3066.10s -> 3074.01s]  Does the guy want drugs? Get out of here. Looking for a girl.
[3078.92s -> 3108.79s]  Who are you? Approach. What? I really think it's one of the people back here.
[3108.79s -> 3111.83s]  I did not explore this way yet. I got to find this last person.
[3112.55s -> 3129.19s]  Why not? Hey, hey, vouch for me. Vouch for me. Look, I'm with the tech.
[3129.75s -> 3139.77s]  Can you vouch for me? Can you say something, please? Say something.
[3141.93s -> 3145.53s]  Or I'm going to blow this up right now and say that I'm selling you drugs. Say something.
[3147.22s -> 3157.29s]  Hey, Bob Richardson is buying drugs from me. Say it. Let us in. Let us in. Are you really trying
[3157.29s -> 3160.81s]  to get me? I will expose you right now. I don't care. People know I'm the drug dealer. Everybody
[3160.81s -> 3179.42s]  knows me in here. I'm the drug dealer with the red hat. All right. Looking for a girl.
[3180.14s -> 3188.10s]  They keep communicating that there's a girl assassin somewhere. Up top, maybe.
[3188.66s -> 3200.65s]  Is this guy still following me? He is. What if I never give this guy drugs? I just take him on
[3200.65s -> 3213.99s]  an elaborate just follow mission where he just follows me around. I can't talk to him. Oh,
[3213.99s -> 3230.09s]  you're getting upset. Omega Lol Skyrim partner. Oh wait, here's the merch store. Is there an assassin
[3230.09s -> 3252.20s]  in here? Nobody here. I'm looking for the last person. Staff only. There's no one even back here.
[3252.84s -> 3264.89s]  This is the front. Did I even check out front? You know what I mean? I feel like I didn't spend
[3264.89s -> 3271.94s]  very much time back here. Is somebody in here? Is somebody out here in the line? I don't know
[3271.94s -> 3285.00s]  where this final person is. They're just waiting in the line. I don't know. What?
[3289.16s -> 3302.68s]  What? What is he talking about? He's doing like a football juke to spin around him.
[3302.68s -> 3306.68s]  Okay all right all right I'm gonna leave. Okay you whip around.
[3308.60s -> 3313.51s]  Where's the other one? Where's the last one? Where's the last guy?
[3314.66s -> 3320.26s]  Where's the last one? Where's the last one? Davenport. I killed Davenport.
[3320.98s -> 3329.22s]  Where's the last one? No no no no no no no no I don't hurt anybody.
[3329.22s -> 3334.26s]  No no no I don't want to hurt anybody. I don't want to hurt anybody.
[3334.26s -> 3351.27s]  I don't want to hurt anybody
[3360.01s -> 3368.65s]  With the last guy ways alive
[3369.25s -> 3378.54s]  The guy live with the guy that I shot in the head is live. No, he's not
[3378.54s -> 3405.40s]  I can't save it until I'm not a country anymore. Oh fuck. I gotta go down. I save it
[3434.17s -> 3442.55s]  Shit I didn't I gotta get his body
[3443.50s -> 3446.58s]  Give me the body. Who the fuck are you? Who's looking at me? Who are you? What are you doing?
[3447.14s -> 3475.85s]  That's unconscious. What is it? Does he know the controls? Yeah, but you hold holding G is awkward
[3475.89s -> 3489.80s]  It's like a weird button to have it be like E. There's a real nasty troublemaker out there
[3490.16s -> 3494.23s]  You don't you say that for like somebody dropped like firecrackers like outside
[3494.83s -> 3502.37s]  Not like someone's killing people with an axe. Thank God. I found security. There's a real like rascal troublemaker out there
[3502.37s -> 3504.37s]  He's dropping the firecrackers
[3533.72s -> 3547.03s]  You gotta be fucking dead
[3547.91s -> 3554.17s]  No
[3554.17s -> 3577.89s]  God damn it. It's give me out of this mission. I don't want to do this one anymore
[3577.89s -> 3615.80s]  I hate this place fucking game is lagging. Oh my god, of course this cameras it hits me
[3616.86s -> 3643.38s]  Really that camera is gonna do this audible frustration intensifies. It doesn't even feel like a hitman mission. Where's the exit?
[3649.91s -> 3679.21s]  No, the exits like up here. Okay, where does he go? They have to go up another floor
[3679.77s -> 3685.73s]  Let me see. Let me look at the map. Club security. Let's go level zero
[3685.73s -> 3700.00s]  Let's see. He just that guy just walks around down here. He just walks around in a circle
[3700.00s -> 3702.36s]  I probably had to have done something to him down there
[3703.04s -> 3707.20s]  The exits up here you leave through this way. I just gotta run but how am I gonna kill this guy?
[3707.48s -> 3712.24s]  How do I kill this guy down here without causing a huge scene?
[3713.20s -> 3720.32s]  Poison or something. He's not that I that's not the drug guy. I don't know. He goes into that side room
[3720.48s -> 3725.77s]  I think I'm gonna shoot him in the head and then run. I need to took out of the next mission
[3725.77s -> 3741.19s]  I just to get out of here and run by with a bicycle. That's plan
[3741.75s -> 3752.55s]  Yeah, I know this is dogshit gameplay. This is like horrible gameplay Andy
[3752.55s -> 3762.98s]  I know but I want to see that I want to get it. I don't like this level. I'm just gonna go for
[3763.52s -> 3775.77s]  Kill him already. I'm just gonna wait till he gets into view so I can do it and I better not shoot this lady in
[3775.77s -> 3793.67s]  The head I better not get up don't no one stand behind me. He's actually coming upstairs. It's perfect
[3793.67s -> 3801.77s]  Alright, here we go. Line it up. Get a good line of sight here
[3802.41s -> 3814.58s]  Right there right there. Here we go. Three two one action. Don't get out. Get it my way
[3816.73s -> 3821.85s]  They don't know it's me, right? They don't know it's me. They've no idea
[3828.68s -> 3838.42s]  What I just went the wrong way. I got shot himself. Wait, what happened? This wasn't the right way
[3838.62s -> 3864.71s]  Isn't this that you've done you hold on? Let me see with this. Where does this go? This goes up here and then
[3865.27s -> 3873.74s]  Bang a left right out this way. How do I get out of here? What's the actual like exit?
[3881.16s -> 3890.99s]  It was the other way. So like down here. Wait, so come here. I go here
[3891.59s -> 3896.90s]  That's not good. You have to go up the exit. Don't you?
[3897.26s -> 3909.95s]  Up the stairs to the right this way and then you're trapped here. No, not off this. It's the same staircase
[3910.57s -> 3918.00s]  And then to the right but then wait the straight through here. Let me see
[3918.44s -> 3934.07s]  It was just the actual I've never been out here yet. What the hell is this place? What the fuck? What is this?
[3934.59s -> 3960.45s]  Why is it like nobody out here? What's the point of this whole area? Just follow the exit sign. Hold on. This is the exit
[3960.49s -> 3979.95s]  That's the exit, right? I'm going for it. There's more areas with more agents. I hope you enjoy it
[3979.95s -> 3987.61s]  I hope this is your favorite level. I hope you love this place. I will never open this level ever again
[3987.93s -> 4004.14s]  I'm not gonna open this level for any reason you could tell me that love it
[4004.14s -> 4008.26s]  It was like five BTC hidden on this level and I wouldn't care. I'd be like, I don't care
[4008.26s -> 4019.60s]  I don't know. I don't want even going there. I'm not going there. I'm following that follow the goddamn exit signs
[4021.99s -> 4034.40s]  There was two green exit signs
[4043.72s -> 4065.93s]  Okay, fine. Where am I?
[4066.01s -> 4071.34s]  It's the bright lights and the fucking concrete and the thousand people get me out of here
[4071.78s -> 4077.98s]  Get me out of the streamer room. I don't want to be in this live streamers room. Okay, get me out of this place, too
[4082.34s -> 4089.46s]  Excuse me. Excuse me. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. It was very nice. That was very fun to see you. Goodbye exit
[4089.46s -> 4097.00s]  I'm out. Where's the exit?
[4097.08s -> 4113.00s]  What I let me locate the exit and I didn't leave who the fuck are these people I'm going to the fucking sewer
[4115.60s -> 4124.61s]  Get out get out go in the sewer. What are you doing? Go in the sewer
[4125.31s -> 4137.52s]  Go in the sewer. Where's the my fucking god? Why can I not go in here put the gun away get me?
[4172.10s -> 4174.10s]  Hiding behind this guy. Oh
[4177.75s -> 4179.75s]  Yes, when will it end why can't I leave
[4180.55s -> 4185.44s]  Why can't I go down sewer? What the fuck is this buggy shithawk?
[4186.36s -> 4189.36s]  Shithawk, what's a shithawk?
[4197.52s -> 4199.12s]  shithawk
[4199.12s -> 4202.96s]  That's some kind of large bird
[4217.35s -> 4219.35s]  God why can't I fucking leave?
[4219.71s -> 4237.10s]  Why are they doing this to me? They're doing it to me on purpose. They're doing to me. This is on purpose. Move
[4248.33s -> 4266.59s]  Please get away from me exit combat. Are you kidding me? Just reload it. Reload it. Reload it. Reload it. Reload it.
[4266.59s -> 4275.99s]  Is that what was happening? I couldn't go in. Use the map. The map in Hitman is one of the most confusing things in the whole game
[4276.15s -> 4288.10s]  No, no, what do you mean blind? I can't even go up there. It was an arrow
[4288.10s -> 4291.76s]  I know but I was trying to sneak away. It's just taking me the same way
[4292.64s -> 4295.54s]  Why can't I just go in the in the in the manhole cover?
[4296.32s -> 4299.64s]  Jesus you're a stormtrooper
[4299.64s -> 4316.88s]  Because you were in combat. I've no I wasn't I wasn't in combat when I opened the manhole
[4316.88s -> 4321.76s]  I I did like the whole G to exit and it didn't do anything
[4322.16s -> 4345.46s]  Go right into the store and then right again it bugged out but the silencer run I guys I didn't unlock the silencer because the game
[4345.66s -> 4352.24s]  Doesn't stay connected to the internet for more than fucking two hours. You remember that shit. I don't have any unlockables
[4352.80s -> 4359.49s]  I've completed like two missions being kicked off line, so I have no progress
[4360.45s -> 4383.85s]  Just stop killing them die. It's the starting gun. Is it? Oh, we're getting real anger
[4386.33s -> 4389.09s]  No, we're not I just like I couldn't unlock any cool things
[4389.77s -> 4395.64s]  All right, just fucking come on. Just get out of here. I'm gonna listen to the one guy
[4395.64s -> 4410.88s]  Let's see if they're right. I said go to the store take a right. Please don't let me down. Don't let me down one guy come on
[4441.60s -> 4452.00s]  I can't I can't just run. I'll die guys. I'll die. I will just die and I can't say
[4452.74s -> 4455.11s]  I'll get shot like three times in the back and die
[4456.03s -> 4464.88s]  Yeah, I will I'll die. I will die
[4465.40s -> 4476.22s]  These guys are made out of like ceramic. Why I don't
[4476.92s -> 4480.89s]  Alright, I'm gonna settle down. I'm gonna relax
[4481.25s -> 4489.89s]  Okay, if I could rank every hitman level across every single one of the video games. This is below ET
[4515.90s -> 4524.74s]  All right, my favorite comment I've read was in all capitals this sucks and you suck at least we both equally suck
[4524.74s -> 4547.06s]  It's not just we both equally suck. I'm like, thank god damn it man. Just fuck this place never coming back here again
[4547.06s -> 4550.62s]  There's gonna be like a five achievements to get here. I'm never gonna see this opened up one way ever
[4551.14s -> 4557.35s]  We started back here like taking a phone call. Remember there's a guy. I gotta try to call somebody
[4558.51s -> 4582.95s]  The Joker how did I get this many achievements for this? This is so embarrassing
[4583.55s -> 4586.53s]  This is so embarrassing
[4586.53s -> 4592.33s]  That's the most amount of achievements for a level think I've gotten in any level even doing it right and doing it the way that you're
[4592.33s -> 4609.62s]  Supposed to but what it isn't that's embarrassing, isn't it? Oh man. Finally, what a shithawk of a level
[4621.21s -> 4627.43s]  Shit cock maybe that's what I was saying. I don't know. Oh cool
[4645.31s -> 4649.77s]  He's and I'm right here and he's doing jumping Jackson he's looks huge he's really really good
[4654.26s -> 4661.60s]  47 he didn't suffer did he he made it
[4662.42s -> 4672.82s]  Nobody cares about the hitman story skip. I
[4675.08s -> 4677.08s]  Mean, I don't but I'm still gonna watch it
[4677.08s -> 4683.16s]  I didn't care about like the Sonic the Hedgehog the movies storyline, but I watched it and thought it was cool
[4692.92s -> 4697.72s]  You stormed the heavens took down the untouchables and yet here we are
[4698.72s -> 4706.27s]  Status quo it just goes to show you can't fight power miss Byrd would power never dies
[4706.47s -> 4708.47s]  It only changes hands
[4709.35s -> 4711.35s]  the best
[4713.83s -> 4715.83s]  Pretty nice picture of a
[4717.11s -> 4724.00s]  It's the thing that gets you to the thing as the next constant you can be the
[4727.55s -> 4729.55s]  Transform the system from the inside
[4730.83s -> 4734.53s]  Be transformed the thing that gets you to the thing
[4735.79s -> 4741.51s]  Power is the thing that gets you powerful. It gives the thing to different people to you to me. It's power
[4741.51s -> 4750.35s]  It's a bit of an object that we can grasp and hold and bring it and bring it hard and bring the gas
[4750.87s -> 4761.97s]  Power power power is power power is a curious thing. Are you fond of riddles?
[4761.97s -> 4769.41s]  Why am I about to hear one three men stand in the barracks a priest a rich man and a clergyman
[4769.85s -> 4773.13s]  Each is bidding the sellsword to kill the other man
[4773.73s -> 4779.61s]  Who kills who well that depends on the sellsword does it he is if not gold or no favor with the crown
[4780.17s -> 4785.53s]  It depends on the sellsword. I don't know. Well, I'll tell you a very small man can cast a large shadow
[4786.05s -> 4795.93s]  No other way. It's a very small. Did I say it right?
[4795.93s -> 4803.34s]  I said it wrong
[4803.34s -> 4806.34s]  Closer. I'm telling you the file John
[4807.76s -> 4815.00s]  Constant doesn't so much burn his bridges as blow them up Arthur Edwards, whoever he was don't exist anymore
[4815.70s -> 4821.66s]  His personal data somehow deletes itself from any system that records him way beyond advanced
[4822.32s -> 4826.69s]  The partner spared no expense to make sure that controller would be untraceable
[4827.25s -> 4829.25s]  How untraceable I?
[4829.65s -> 4838.56s]  Did what you asked but gray's gone and I'm no Diana. That's the first since I actually comprehended in about you gotta be kidding six minutes
[4838.56s -> 4846.67s]  I see they're hacking somewhere. I used every encryption known to men. Who are these guys best?
[4846.91s -> 4852.32s]  It's only a matter of time before they get luck. We need to take them down
[4853.38s -> 4860.40s]  You and which army I don't need one the agency stores its files mission reports client data
[4861.12s -> 4865.25s]  If we leak it to the public you want to whistleblow the ICA
[4866.29s -> 4869.65s]  It's the path of least resistance. Holy shit. They made a hitman movie
[4870.53s -> 4874.69s]  Did anyone see it? I don't think anybody saw it
[4875.59s -> 4888.79s]  And i'm out. So what are we breaking into data facility and chunking three of them run by a man, of course
[4889.43s -> 4895.52s]  The ICA side in Chongqing houses the agency's data storage and analyst division
[4896.66s -> 4899.14s]  Needless to say security is daunting
[4900.18s -> 4904.98s]  The state of the art server vault is biometrically wired to the facilities to overseers
[4905.94s -> 4907.46s]  imaging reuss
[4907.46s -> 4909.54s]  behavioral analysis pioneer
[4909.54s -> 4910.82s]  and hush
[4910.82s -> 4914.60s]  A data security guru with a taste for fringe transhuman experimentation
[4915.78s -> 4921.06s]  Tell me about hush. It's a matrix a former cyber terrorist for the ministry of state security in kadan yang
[4921.62s -> 4925.38s]  Who fled his country after one of the po regime's periodic purges?
[4926.26s -> 4932.58s]  He made a career doing cyber security for dark web deplorables human traffickers organ harvesters
[4933.22s -> 4936.98s]  Scum like him with no code or conscience no code
[4937.70s -> 4940.02s]  ICA sure can pick them
[4940.02s -> 4941.38s]  No offense
[4941.38s -> 4943.38s]  Can you disable security? Whoa?
[4943.78s -> 4950.10s]  A dual authentication wait are they plugged in any handling of data must be directly authorized by hush and royce
[4950.82s -> 4954.18s]  The proverbial human factor device to make the system impenetrable
[4955.14s -> 4957.38s]  Luckily, I found a loophole
[4958.42s -> 4961.94s]  If both overseers should unexpectedly die within a short space of time
[4961.94s -> 4968.02s]  Oh, no, the system reverts to a temporary failsafe protocol, which I can buy so they both have to die within like a minute
[4968.02s -> 4970.90s]  Take them off the board and you'll have free access to the data core
[4971.70s -> 4973.62s]  And i'll handle the rest
[4973.62s -> 4976.12s]  And you're sure it'll work
[4976.20s -> 4981.58s]  Look, I know hush. Oh just like the romeo and juliette encounter. We won't live long enough in carousel
[4982.68s -> 4984.20s]  Yes like that
[4984.20s -> 4996.90s]  Wink wink both of us leave you to prepare. I'm so glad i'm getting just massive minus two
[5000.04s -> 5002.32s]  All right, let's go
[5002.32s -> 5005.52s]  That's on master
[5005.52s -> 5007.52s]  Excuse me. Oh, no, I thought it was selected. Okay
[5008.34s -> 5009.22s]  Oh
[5009.22s -> 5016.31s]  All right. Here we go
[5016.31s -> 5018.04s]  neon city
[5018.04s -> 5020.79s]  I'm ready mission stories
[5021.27s -> 5046.00s]  Certainty principle impulse control all seeing I i'm looking forward to this one. Let's go. I'm not doing master. No chonking china
[5046.72s -> 5052.80s]  This city is big brother's wet dream with more than 2.5 million cameras covering 15 million people that seems
[5054.16s -> 5056.16s]  That seems like they would get stuck everywhere
[5056.24s -> 5062.24s]  It's pretty ironic four of those would just be in your pantry randomly during the day. That'd be horrible
[5063.80s -> 5071.81s]  You'll find hush conducting his fringe experiments in an abandoned apartment building while imaging royce the archivist
[5072.29s -> 5075.25s]  Runs a day-to-day business of the ica data facility. Okay
[5076.37s -> 5078.37s]  I just hope you know what you're doing 47
[5079.91s -> 5085.44s]  All right sniper
[5085.44s -> 5090.32s]  All right, eliminate hush eliminate emojin royce hack the data core
[5090.80s -> 5100.92s]  What we got here, this is pretty level they're very very far away. They're very far away. Okay
[5101.64s -> 5111.62s]  Holy shit. This is so high up
[5111.70s -> 5116.05s]  And look anybody that wants to tell me
[5116.05s -> 5118.05s]  That says durama don't push her
[5120.66s -> 5122.66s]  She's only here to be pushed
[5123.38s -> 5125.57s]  You understand?
[5125.57s -> 5127.41s]  It's the beginning of the level
[5127.41s -> 5129.49s]  It's just one person right at a balcony
[5130.37s -> 5136.53s]  They put this person here to try to just see who will push her off. It doesn't it's why there's no reason for this person
[5136.53s -> 5150.95s]  To be here. Okay. Look at look. She's the only one
[5151.67s -> 5159.19s]  All right, let's get I want to get some intel. It's a very pretty map. It is
[5159.83s -> 5161.03s]  ooh
[5161.03s -> 5177.03s]  Can I ride that? I think i'm gonna go this way go back and shove her now
[5177.67s -> 5187.03s]  No, you can do it in your playthrough. I guess i'm just gonna just check out up here
[5188.63s -> 5189.91s]  Oh, wait
[5189.91s -> 5191.35s]  I can drop these
[5191.35s -> 5198.96s]  But why would I want to do that? This guy care that i'm going into this like a house
[5204.72s -> 5214.39s]  Laundromat what's going on in here?
[5215.48s -> 5218.58s]  Uh, wait, what is going on in here?
[5223.16s -> 5225.56s]  It's like just buckets. So they do you go to a laundromat and like wash your
[5226.36s -> 5228.12s]  Clothes and like just like a bucket
[5228.12s -> 5233.06s]  Wait, i'm confused. Well, where are the wait a minute. Oh, they're just not here. Okay
[5236.79s -> 5245.48s]  Any intel
[5255.83s -> 5266.71s]  Oh, well, sorry
[5266.71s -> 5272.21s]  Buy one buy one and let it come up
[5275.09s -> 5276.61s]  Oh nothing came out
[5276.61s -> 5281.40s]  You just kick it. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, we just boot that
[5289.09s -> 5291.14s]  You didn't get one here
[5291.14s -> 5292.66s]  Here I can help you
[5292.66s -> 5294.66s]  Look, I know these things can be kind of finicky
[5295.44s -> 5301.84s]  There yeah, I pressed on uh lemon lime soda and a root beer came out. That means yours was in the queue before mine
[5307.16s -> 5308.93s]  um
[5308.93s -> 5309.81s]  Okay
[5309.81s -> 5314.93s]  What's in here?
[5314.93s -> 5317.33s]  Sorry, I like looked at you for a second
[5321.60s -> 5323.20s]  Just throw it to her
[5323.20s -> 5332.95s]  Oh, yeah, good call
[5332.95s -> 5333.91s]  Okay
[5333.91s -> 5340.80s]  Out of the laundromat. We're now
[5340.80s -> 5360.34s]  You up there opportunity 47 a guard patrols are clearly searching for something on the roof of the laundry
[5360.90s -> 5368.76s]  What could they be looking for?
[5368.76s -> 5372.84s]  Why don't we find out?
[5372.84s -> 5382.80s]  Okay, is there a ladder I can climb up on is there a way to go up from here?
[5383.04s -> 5392.92s]  What about this way interact with the keypad?
[5393.48s -> 5415.24s]  I gotta get the code from this guy
[5415.24s -> 5418.50s]  Watch the code to the door
[5418.58s -> 5421.46s]  Say it on one of the uh, one of these things. No, that'd be funny if it did
[5425.17s -> 5426.69s]  Ooh, what is that?
[5426.69s -> 5430.84s]  Okay, this like poison over there. Hold on. I just want to get heaven. I want it to come out
[5437.67s -> 5439.67s]  Wait, can I give me the iron?
[5439.75s -> 5447.99s]  Is there a way to go up from here? I gotta get on the roof
[5451.56s -> 5455.81s]  And wait
[5455.81s -> 5458.45s]  Can I jump out when it's right there?
[5466.28s -> 5474.40s]  It's written on one of the laundry machines
[5475.20s -> 5476.82s]  Is it?
[5476.82s -> 5485.73s]  Well, do I need to do that?
[5485.73s -> 5499.00s]  I climbed the pipe. Let's go down here. See if I can wrap around. I don't want to push him yet
[5499.08s -> 5502.42s]  No, I need to explore the area. What's going on in the noodle place?
[5523.40s -> 5524.76s]  Noodle run. Okay
[5524.76s -> 5535.09s]  That wasn't data. How was that not data? I just don't want I don't want that to be very loud. Hold on
[5535.33s -> 5541.28s]  Okay, that wasn't intel of any kind
[5543.24s -> 5546.37s]  But up there
[5546.92s -> 5557.38s]  Okay, I see a pipe. I'm gonna let me get on top of the laundromat. Let me find a way up there down here
[5559.22s -> 5563.51s]  And then go up that way. He's drinking a heel
[5568.71s -> 5584.29s]  Okay, get on top of the laundromat. What's this?
[5588.64s -> 5592.56s]  No, I already went up this way. Is there how do I get on there? I do I think I have to jump out of that
[5593.12s -> 5595.76s]  This just takes me around the back
[5595.76s -> 5598.20s]  It's a loop. Yeah
[5603.46s -> 5608.50s]  Can I hang from here? How do I need maybe I can't can I get on this pipe? I don't think I can get on the pipe
[5616.20s -> 5619.30s]  Can I jump from here? I don't know
[5620.18s -> 5628.40s]  What's the map look like? No, I don't know because this is the laundromat here. There's a staircase
[5629.41s -> 5631.49s]  Wait, I think I might do I need the password?
[5632.21s -> 5635.67s]  I think I need the password
[5635.67s -> 5647.14s]  Do I need to reload the whole map? Is that you guys not fucking around? I was gonna explore
[5655.92s -> 5660.56s]  You know, okay down i'm gonna down to this. How what's the time? How I have to kill him in a certain time frame
[5660.80s -> 5680.55s]  Is that legit?
[5680.71s -> 5685.25s]  Stealing her past
[5686.05s -> 5688.80s]  What does that mean though? What's that mean?
[5693.59s -> 5718.08s]  Is it just me or have they upped the crazy lately? Where's the fucking intel? I want to do this one
[5718.56s -> 5732.47s]  It says I can make a lot of money to be in some experiment
[5733.03s -> 5735.03s]  Oh put me in the experiment, please
[5735.43s -> 5741.56s]  What the hell is happening?
[5741.56s -> 5744.08s]  What are you guys doing? Why is everyone freaking out?
[5746.39s -> 5748.39s]  This is my chance
[5748.39s -> 5752.08s]  Are we throwing it on sub only?
[5752.08s -> 5756.93s]  Throw it on sub on throw it on sub only immediately. I just missed this
[5766.31s -> 5769.99s]  All right disguise yourself as a homeless person, right? They were talking about like the okay
[5770.95s -> 5775.30s]  This is I kind of I don't this like I don't like this
[5779.99s -> 5782.63s]  Why do I have to take a homeless person's disguise?
[5783.72s -> 5786.20s]  Why can't I just say i'm homeless? I don't understand that
[5788.92s -> 5790.92s]  Why do I have to like take this guy out?
[5798.18s -> 5800.34s]  Oh shit, the fucking channel points shit

[6920.08s -> 6929.38s]  This guy's as the board member. Yeah, isn't that the guy that was just sitting at the restaurant?

[7480.60s -> 7482.60s]  You see the red
[7482.60s -> 7486.53s]  All is a break, please. Why?
[7490.95s -> 7493.51s]  Oh, that's what this is the secret takes you along

[7511.14s -> 7513.14s]  Yeah, I knew it was zero one one eight
[7513.38s -> 7523.03s]  I'm pretty good at guessing
[7523.03s -> 7527.43s]  No, this is why it's cement everywhere. I can't wait. Well, there's the big reveal
[7527.75s -> 7532.50s]  Welcome, please report to security desk for visitor sign in we'll do
[7536.48s -> 7543.84s]  Is really looking out for us and we're in the inside is a self-contained modular bill that can be disassembled
[7543.92s -> 7550.32s]  I'm in in less than 12 hours. I'm in we are compromised no trace. We will ever hear I agree
[7551.04s -> 7553.68s]  Leaving no trace behind is the only sensible
[7554.48s -> 7562.32s]  The outside shell is a building marked for demolition. We put a hold on it with city planning a deliberate misplacement of the order
[7562.96s -> 7565.60s]  But have people in place to rectify that
[7566.32s -> 7569.28s]  At first shift city construction will move in
[7570.64s -> 7578.24s]  Our policy around ica personnel is that they are a resource but also a risk on top of contractual repercussions
[7578.32s -> 7582.32s]  If breaches occur, we perform detailed vetting on every
[7585.86s -> 7587.86s]  Blood
[7587.86s -> 7593.64s]  To vetting is a frisk. We have of course never had you can use your camera to hack that panel
[7596.42s -> 7603.24s]  But we do consider that important i'll need to stop the setup of your visitor security clearance
[7603.30s -> 7605.30s]  I'm just like taking pictures of everything
[7605.78s -> 7609.46s]  Please give me your people you want mr. Richard so we can get things rolling
[7611.78s -> 7617.99s]  Hello, sir, p41. How do I give it to you?
[7626.87s -> 7628.87s]  Procedure
[7632.47s -> 7637.91s]  Okay, you'll have to be frisked like everyone. Oh, I should probably put the gun down mr. Richard
[7641.43s -> 7643.43s]  All right. Let me take a let me look around first
[7645.49s -> 7647.49s]  There's no way you're getting through that door 47
[7647.89s -> 7653.49s]  It only opens for people with an authentic security clearance. The signal is encrypted without a dongle. We can't hack it
[7653.49s -> 7658.29s]  Uh, did you see did you see on your camera? Did you see I hope you did?
[7659.52s -> 7669.32s]  Of course, I got it
[7681.19s -> 7684.55s]  Oh god damn this guy's on a fucking cell phone, of course, he's not gonna pay attention
[7686.16s -> 7713.11s]  Wait, that means I can just walk by him

[7730.08s -> 7734.16s]  Tier one access dongle. I don't even need to be in here anymore. I got an access dongle
[7734.80s -> 7740.29s]  Holy shit. I got an access dongle
[7740.29s -> 7744.77s]  A dongle provides olivia with the encryption key needed to hack access tier one rfid panels
[7745.25s -> 7749.64s]  Now I gotta hide my gun
[7749.64s -> 7759.56s]  So I can I you what is it? I guess that blocks out the view
[7765.22s -> 7767.22s]  Security protocol overruled
[7770.45s -> 7775.25s]  Security protocol overruled I can just open up off the door. Wait, can I open up the door behind them?
[7776.93s -> 7778.45s]  God, that would be funny
[7778.45s -> 7780.69s]  No, don't first me yet. I'm not ready. I have a gun on me

[7805.83s -> 7807.83s]  Is a vent into this room
[7808.44s -> 7810.44s]  Okay, hold on. Cool. This is cool. I like hacking stuff
[7811.00s -> 7818.77s]  This is way cooler than the the 15 watchdogs allegiance missions that I played
[7819.41s -> 7821.57s]  Where was the same two missions back and forth?
[7822.05s -> 7832.56s]  What's this package? I'll take it. I don't even know what it is. I'll take it though. All right, I gotta put a gun away
[7833.28s -> 7838.69s]  All right, we're gonna conceal, uh the gun
[7839.25s -> 7843.36s]  Do I have anything else illegal?
[7843.36s -> 7846.31s]  No, what the fuck man?
[7846.31s -> 7848.39s]  I have okay. I have a lot of illegal items
[7848.79s -> 7860.64s]  What is it? How do you drop stuff? F G L
[7867.36s -> 7871.52s]  Z
[7871.52s -> 7873.52s]  All right. I have no more illegal items. Right?
[7874.08s -> 7890.02s]  I kind of want to get frisked while I hold a meaty bone in my hand. Yeah. Sorry. I just got back from disneyland
[7891.30s -> 7895.62s]  Have you had one of these have you had one of these yet? I'm gonna need to go through your pockets my friend
[7896.02s -> 7899.80s]  Let me just pat you down here
[7900.20s -> 7909.09s]  Proceed by the way, those things are gross
[7910.42s -> 7915.38s]  Oh the gigantic turkey leg those things are disgusting. I hate them. Who wants to eat that? They're terrible
[7915.70s -> 7919.70s]  They get cold and shit you you bite like two bites off of it and it's cold in five to ten minutes
[7919.70s -> 7924.50s]  You're walking around like outside. It's really like stringy meat. It's just like a meme
[7924.58s -> 7938.50s]  I don't know. They're not even they're not good. Don't order those go get the mickey mouse ears chocolate bar. Can I close this window?
[7938.98s -> 7946.34s]  Good you're here. I am here
[7948.26s -> 7951.54s]  It will take a little while since you're covered by the zero protocol
[7952.18s -> 7953.94s]  all your data will
[7953.94s -> 7961.60s]  Be encrypted and inaccessible without your authorization access only facility ai will use it for id analysis
[7962.16s -> 7967.20s]  Fully anonymized, of course, but we can do a few more steps on the tour while it's validating
[7968.48s -> 7971.04s]  Id analysis what the hell does that mean?
[7972.15s -> 7974.15s]  Give me a minute. I'll try to find out
[7974.55s -> 7987.22s]  Nothing in here take something something to take chloroform and
[7987.94s -> 7995.75s]  Tiered an access dongle
[8002.20s -> 8010.20s]  Caught
[8010.20s -> 8012.52s]  I'm just so annoying. This is probably you know
[8012.52s -> 8018.20s]  This is probably what it was like to like be a hotel concierge and deal with the rock bands that came in
[8018.76s -> 8020.36s]  Back in like the 80s
[8020.36s -> 8025.08s]  We perform a type of obnoxious shit. They probably had to deal with to guarantee that no
[8030.04s -> 8037.08s]  Drug use physical health issues external pressure or moral hesitancy the scan only takes a few seconds
[8037.48s -> 8039.48s]  Let's step inside
[8040.20s -> 8051.84s]  Until the iSafe facility has top-level security because of the highly stressful nature of the job employees are put through mandatory checkups on a regular basis
[8052.54s -> 8058.16s]  Additionally, they are being monitored for elevated stress levels and other risk factors while in the workplace
[8058.48s -> 8074.48s]  Will they scan my barcode? We can't proceed beyond this room until your security clearance is finalized
[8075.04s -> 8079.52s]  So why don't you have a little look around while we wait? Mr. Richard? It should be here
[8080.48s -> 8082.37s]  Shortly
[8082.37s -> 8083.57s]  Shit
[8083.57s -> 8087.41s]  We need to intercept that 47 or the facility ai will blow your cover
[8088.05s -> 8092.93s]  Blow me up to one of those computers and do it fast computer. You've got 60 seconds before all hell breaks loose
[8092.93s -> 8096.45s]  I have 60 seconds to get into a computer. What do we 60 hack this one?
[8097.49s -> 8099.49s]  Wait, don't look at me
[8100.24s -> 8109.08s]  security protocol
[8109.56s -> 8117.96s]  Good i'm in i'm in and and you're safe
[8119.36s -> 8120.88s]  That was a close one
[8120.88s -> 8124.00s]  You didn't see shit
[8124.00s -> 8129.83s]  What's on your desk?
[8129.83s -> 8132.23s]  You are way too close to me and you're really freaking me out
[8135.32s -> 8138.04s]  Your clearance just came through let's continue
[8139.65s -> 8141.65s]  How many of these dongles do I have?
[8147.54s -> 8149.54s]  All right, let's see what it did
[8150.34s -> 8153.86s]  Come on this way. Uh, your floor is two floors up on the elevator
[8155.06s -> 8160.24s]  Maybe just go take a look inside what we just did over there with the printer. What did you do?
[8160.56s -> 8162.88s]  I signed my ass and I scanned my ass on it
[8164.53s -> 8177.57s]  Ha ha ha great very serious about security
[8178.13s -> 8185.89s]  What we protect is after all core to all ica operation we and we alone store all legal work
[8190.21s -> 8194.45s]  I just made her mouth closed do like the closed jaw teeth it like
[8195.89s -> 8200.21s]  It made like a loud and she bit her teeth together that sucks when that happens
[8200.29s -> 8204.13s]  Target profiles and of course offer real-time contract support
[8204.45s -> 8211.89s]  If your chin gets closed too hard like you get bumped and it's like you bite like that takes constant vigilance to keep safe
[8212.61s -> 8219.97s]  We have a team of engineers solely dedicated to that task and on top of that we have a dual human authentication process set up
[8220.45s -> 8221.33s]  all
[8221.33s -> 8227.22s]  Access and alterations to the source are authentic
[8227.62s -> 8230.57s]  Oh
[8238.41s -> 8242.89s]  I'm sorry. It's like if you get too close to the ropes in the wrestling ring, i'm gonna push you over
[8244.15s -> 8246.87s]  I saw that coming. She was getting really close
[8254.18s -> 8256.18s]  Wait, that was the target that walked out
[8260.25s -> 8263.19s]  Oh my god, it is
[8267.93s -> 8271.13s]  Imogen royce i've been looking forward to meeting you likewise
[8286.22s -> 8288.32s]  Wait, hold on. Did that just say attack?
[8304.78s -> 8307.46s]  I'm gonna get you
[8307.70s -> 8309.94s]  Wait a second. Hold on
[8310.10s -> 8313.82s]  Hold on just a second
[8313.90s -> 8316.52s]  If I can I pull her off?
[8321.99s -> 8323.99s]  I hope I can
[8330.42s -> 8333.54s]  Nice to meet you. Yes, it is. It's very it's wonderful
[8359.40s -> 8369.40s]  What I could have pushed him out the grade
[8370.12s -> 8380.04s]  Try to put the gun down
[8380.12s -> 8382.20s]  All right. All right. All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's go
[8384.89s -> 8386.89s]  Can you imagine seeing that?
[8387.54s -> 8391.78s]  The person you're giving the tour to oh, yes, it's very nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Yeah
[8392.90s -> 8397.46s]  Over the edge, although that guy's fucking weird. I don't know why excuse me. Um, mr. Mr. Pritchett
[8397.46s -> 8410.81s]  Do you know can you come back over just grabs pulls her over what's I don't even know his name
[8422.54s -> 8425.82s]  I want to remember this moment the rest of my fucking life
[8428.06s -> 8430.06s]  Looking forward to meeting you likewise
[8430.86s -> 8434.73s]  Let's go
[8434.73s -> 8436.81s]  So show me what's going on in this facility
[8440.47s -> 8442.95s]  God damn it. Don't get close. Don't get that close to the edge. I'm telling you
[8443.03s -> 8446.95s]  I'm like a fucking trapdoor spider if you get too close, you're gonna go i'm gonna grab you
[8447.75s -> 8454.95s]  This is the blood and emp shielded call room the nervous system of the ica where we store the past and facilitate the present
[8456.09s -> 8462.73s]  In general only a handful of people can access this room hush and myself plus bodyguards and a chosen few of the engineers
[8463.29s -> 8469.37s]  I'm the most likely person to meet in here because I perform a regular physical check-in on the core console as you plug in
[8475.90s -> 8483.10s]  We have a strict routine of daily core maintenance part of that procedure is a flash process evaporating all biological matter in the room
[8484.06s -> 8486.42s]  Yeah, do it with that maybe we could
[8487.62s -> 8493.06s]  It's her job to initiate the maintenance. Don't worry. We're safe. I read the safety mechanism is engaged
[8493.46s -> 8498.82s]  Even if reed presses the button the procedure will not happen until we leave the call room the doors to the call room
[8498.82s -> 8500.82s]  Are all equipped with
[8501.78s -> 8503.78s]  What screw this tour?
[8504.10s -> 8507.06s]  I know why you're really here. It's a chase. I see
[8508.34s -> 8510.10s]  Knowledge is power
[8510.10s -> 8517.06s]  More importantly knowledge stand the way turn around. Don't look at me spin around you kill him. Don't kill him
[8518.66s -> 8520.66s]  Power is power
[8520.66s -> 8524.02s]  Has not been reported it has no doubt brought you here
[8524.74s -> 8530.10s]  You do have authority to shut down unwanted efforts, but I just did that like an hour ago
[8530.18s -> 8532.18s]  But there was not an opportunity to do it
[8532.58s -> 8538.34s]  You have sway with the board and as I see it your opinion is now power is the thing that gets you the thing
[8540.50s -> 8542.58s]  So here we go imagine this
[8543.46s -> 8550.02s]  Having a time schedule on a target with minute details on location doesn't matter who has the power someone will always have power
[8550.90s -> 8552.82s]  power is
[8552.82s -> 8556.98s]  Attainable and one of us will have it will have that transform a contract
[8557.30s -> 8559.30s]  powerful
[8559.62s -> 8561.62s]  No mess no fuss
[8561.62s -> 8563.62s]  Low cost just how I like it
[8564.20s -> 8572.36s]  I've been working on a prediction algorithm based on a combination of big data analysis and micro targeted surveillance of defining target markers
[8572.36s -> 8573.96s]  I have to pee so bad
[8573.96s -> 8576.04s]  are astounding
[8576.12s -> 8583.72s]  All this state of the art is nothing but heavy old-fashioned machinery compared to what I offer analysts preparing detailed files
[8583.80s -> 8590.84s]  Dedicating days weeks to prepare our contracts gone handlers and analysts supporting our operatives during missions
[8591.24s -> 8596.20s]  Gone teams for cleanup and media manipulation in the rare case something else does happen
[8596.92s -> 8600.92s]  All of it gone. I asked you to imagine that scenario
[8601.32s -> 8604.84s]  But what good is imagination when you can see it with your own eyes?
[8605.48s -> 8608.92s]  I've set up a little demonstration for you. This is where they kill me
[8609.64s -> 8613.00s]  Three employees unaware that I can accurately predict their behavior
[8613.64s -> 8618.12s]  Accurately predict my behavior in an already clearly defined reaction on the top left
[8618.20s -> 8623.16s]  We have sharon reed who you saw downstairs. She's a dutiful and trusted employee
[8623.88s -> 8631.80s]  If she is to be fired my algorithm predicts with a certainty of 97.8 percent that she will finish up her most important tasks
[8631.88s -> 8638.36s]  Before she leaves the building interesting specifically she will press the maintenance button within 11 seconds
[8638.44s -> 8642.76s]  Will she the guard in the lower left is as tough as nails when on duty
[8643.24s -> 8645.56s]  But in private he's a real mummy's boy
[8646.20s -> 8653.00s]  If fired he will immediately call his mother and at her advice seek out who he considers his best friend for support
[8653.08s -> 8655.80s]  Why is she giving me mission intel objectives?
[8656.76s -> 8665.85s]  Explains why he's always next to me at lunch at the top right you see alicia reynolds right and very passionate about her job
[8666.41s -> 8669.93s]  However, also very possessive about her contribution
[8670.01s -> 8674.97s]  Okay, my prediction is that she will try to disable the work she has done for the ica
[8675.61s -> 8677.61s]  If she's not allowed to enjoy her results
[8677.85s -> 8684.01s]  No one is specifically that means she will try to enter the call room and disable the safety mechanism
[8684.09s -> 8687.53s]  I'll leave you to consider your choice of who you want me to use for the demonstration
[8687.69s -> 8692.33s]  Just let the guard outside the door know when you're ready and i'll be right back. I will have a closer look
[8693.13s -> 8696.49s]  Maybe your project could play a part in the future of the ica
[8696.73s -> 8701.13s]  Just let the guard outside the door know when you're ready and i'll be right back only two of us in here
[8701.13s -> 8704.97s]  If you decide to leave the room a guard will escort you around safety protocol
[8705.61s -> 8709.69s]  So there's only two of you. She really takes the term god complex to a whole new level
[8710.65s -> 8716.87s]  Sitting in there pulling the strings like that. Oh, I think you should take her setup and give it a spin 47 sure
[8717.43s -> 8718.71s]  I see
[8718.71s -> 8724.54s]  Potential if you time it right
[8725.11s -> 8727.11s]  Use terminal who are you gonna fire?
[8728.14s -> 8729.58s]  erin reid
[8729.58s -> 8733.05s]  disabled
[8733.05s -> 8734.41s]  jeremy bolt
[8734.41s -> 8736.41s]  or alicia reynolds
[8736.41s -> 8738.33s]  disabled safety mechanism
[8738.33s -> 8740.57s]  performs core maintenance by disabled safety
[8748.22s -> 8766.68s]  Uh, okay, that was weird. All right. I'm gonna fire alicia reynolds. We're gonna disable
[8766.76s -> 8771.66s]  The security system alicia reynolds
[8772.14s -> 8776.95s]  I regret to inform you that code 41 is now effective for your employment status
[8777.75s -> 8779.75s]  Thank you for your service
[8782.34s -> 8788.50s]  Don't mind me, sir. I'll be escorting you around. I'm ready to see voice now. I'll let her know don't mind me, sir
[8789.06s -> 8791.38s]  I'll be escorting you around. Can I do that backwards?
[8792.34s -> 8804.30s]  The vip is ready to see you
[8804.38s -> 8806.22s]  Sharon reid
[8806.22s -> 8810.54s]  I regret to inform you that code 41 is now effective firing everybody
[8811.42s -> 8813.42s]  Thank you for your service
[8827.22s -> 8830.20s]  Okay, um
[8830.20s -> 8833.32s]  Yeah, so I I disabled the safety mechanisms and then I go do something
[8833.72s -> 8840.10s]  Do I have to do these in a row? I gotta pee. Let me go pee
[8840.10s -> 8843.45s]  I'll be right back first beer every other night if you time it right beer be
[8844.09s -> 8847.03s]  Let me know I have to go to the bathroom
[8847.03s -> 9094.71s]  I'll be right back. All right. I may have startled you. I don't want to five cat boys cat boy. All right, let's go
[9102.82s -> 9116.66s]  Streaming. All right. So there's a there's an order to this right? Okay, so
[9117.22s -> 9120.02s]  Core maintenance
[9120.02s -> 9131.26s]  Engineer so why hold on right and very passionate if fired
[9131.26s -> 9135.34s]  There's a 98 that she will try to disable the safety mechanism in the core room
[9136.23s -> 9142.62s]  Okay, if fired he will leave his post at the core room door to call his mother
[9143.18s -> 9148.68s]  Okay, if fired she will finish her most critical task before leaving the facility
[9148.76s -> 9151.96s]  She will press the core maintenance button within 11 seconds
[9153.85s -> 9162.30s]  Okay, so we need to so core maintenance so we have to go
[9163.19s -> 9164.44s]  one
[9164.44s -> 9167.64s]  Fire alicia fire jeremy fire alicia and then fire
[9168.20s -> 9180.12s]  Sharon read or fire jeremy fire alicia then sharon so fire jeremy
[9180.68s -> 9182.68s]  Fire alicia and then sharon
[9184.23s -> 9196.54s]  All right, because we have only have 11 seconds. Let's try it first. Let's try jeremy sharon alicia
[9199.96s -> 9201.32s]  jeremy bolt
[9201.32s -> 9208.28s]  Correct to inform you that code 41 is now effective for your employment status. No alicia first because I only have 11 seconds
[9211.00s -> 9214.60s]  Code 41 is confirmed effective for your employment status
[9215.80s -> 9220.97s]  alicia reynolds
[9220.97s -> 9227.61s]  I regret to inform you that code 41 is now effective for your employment. She has 11 seconds to get over there for your service
[9227.93s -> 9229.93s]  No, it was it was sharon first
[9230.25s -> 9234.18s]  right
[9234.18s -> 9235.94s]  Sharon read
[9235.94s -> 9240.50s]  I regret to inform you that code 41 is now effective for your employment status
[9241.14s -> 9245.62s]  Thank you. Oh, okay. So I hold on the way over there. I did them all okay. Wait, wait, wait
[9247.29s -> 9252.57s]  Yeah, okay. I get it. I understand. I get it. I get it. Okay, so you do it to jeremy you wait till he unlocks the door
[9253.53s -> 9255.29s]  Actually, did I do too fast?
[9255.29s -> 9259.18s]  It still might happen
[9259.99s -> 9261.27s]  Okay
[9261.27s -> 9262.55s]  They're going
[9262.55s -> 9266.38s]  She got in they switched
[9266.38s -> 9278.66s]  Here he comes
[9278.66s -> 9311.58s]  Got it. What happened they get it. It's way too early wait for the safety mechanism to be disabled then fire sharon, right?
[9312.46s -> 9327.10s]  Right, right. Okay, that's true. All right, so we go disable disable jeremy give it like five to ten seconds
[9327.74s -> 9344.92s]  Disable alicia and then wait like a minute and then fire sharon read here we go. Jeremy bolt
[9345.72s -> 9350.52s]  I regret to inform you that code 41 is now effective for your employment status
[9351.08s -> 9353.08s]  Thank you for your service
[9353.40s -> 9358.63s]  Be right code 41 is confirmed effective for your employment status
[9358.71s -> 9360.71s]  Okay, hold on one
[9360.71s -> 9361.67s]  two
[9361.67s -> 9362.63s]  three
[9362.63s -> 9363.67s]  four
[9363.67s -> 9364.71s]  five
[9364.71s -> 9365.67s]  six
[9365.67s -> 9366.71s]  seven
[9366.71s -> 9367.75s]  eight
[9367.75s -> 9368.79s]  nine
[9368.79s -> 9373.00s]  Ten go
[9373.00s -> 9375.32s]  And then we're gonna wait a minute and we're gonna get rid of farron
[9377.88s -> 9379.72s]  Is this sub only?
[9379.72s -> 9384.52s]  Well, I thought I told you guys you needed to behave what people freaking out people be non with people misbehaving
[9386.44s -> 9388.12s]  Okay, so
[9388.12s -> 9391.32s]  Alicia disables the safety mechanism sharon gets fired

[10097.59s -> 10103.43s]  Yeah, what is this shit brick massage?
[10106.81s -> 10108.49s]  I thought that was a door

[10116.71s -> 10119.51s]  All right to go up the stairs all the way up to tier three
[10119.99s -> 10149.06s]  Does that mean tier three like three deep or three up? That's three deep
[10151.22s -> 10161.61s]  Is it use the map? That's three deep or is it?
[10170.23s -> 10177.54s]  With the emergency exit open if I hack it I get in one guide. Is that real? Oh

[10958.58s -> 10962.25s]  I'm definitely gonna need that
[10962.25s -> 10989.42s]  It's a gun. What is it? I'm a security. I'm a security guard. Do I have to pretend to be a test subject?
[10989.74s -> 10996.39s]  Okay, let's let's let's do the test subject one
[11011.02s -> 11013.83s]  Because it doesn't I don't want to do it
[11014.47s -> 11036.52s]  No package for you
[11036.52s -> 11048.36s]  Bye. Okay. Now I why would they give me the opportunity to do that now? I have to get rid of the gun

[11091.96s -> 11095.16s]  He looks a lot older
[11129.06s -> 11147.40s]  Tomato in his face identify memory marker 90. I mean, I can't keep getting away with it, right?
[11155.35s -> 11157.35s]  Why it wants me to throw in his head
[11172.65s -> 11175.70s]  You can't go around people's heads like that
[11176.74s -> 11181.75s]  I understand
[11181.75s -> 11184.95s]  Does that jog the memory does that jog your memory?
[11192.92s -> 11204.36s]  I mean, I guess I could could I just go and zap him. Okay, I just I could just overload his brain with
[11204.92s -> 11211.83s]  Just junk, right?
[11221.91s -> 11227.29s]  I want to overload his brain
[11236.47s -> 11238.47s]  I can all right. All right. All right
[11239.51s -> 11244.57s]  I'm ready to experiment. Oh good. I'll let sister. They know to join us for the experiment
[11250.81s -> 11254.65s]  We'll get started now. We're gonna lock in and have like a battle inside of our heads
[11256.92s -> 11259.00s]  I see what we have an eye and e is there an o
[11259.64s -> 11273.59s]  He's ready for you. He looks strong. Hey by good specimen to conclude this phase. We'll get started when sister lays here
[11275.75s -> 11277.75s]  It's gonna be a mind battle. Yeah
[11277.75s -> 11279.75s]  we're both gonna be like
[11280.98s -> 11284.94s]  Came to his senses. I see sister lay
[11285.66s -> 11288.01s]  Yes
[11288.01s -> 11290.01s]  Please I need space
[11290.41s -> 11299.69s]  What sister lay yes, we're about to perform the final test of this project here we go
[11301.72s -> 11308.63s]  Hijack the data
[11315.88s -> 11326.42s]  Ready when jimmy let's start at 100 signal spectrum. What am I supposed to do here? I mean, there's no need
[11326.98s -> 11332.82s]  The subject is clean cooperative. I was thinking 25 percent and then adjust if necessary
[11333.14s -> 11339.66s]  60 percent is minimum. We'll get no motor control below. Am I actually gonna like blow his head up with my brain?
[11340.22s -> 11346.44s]  Long experiment page 109 initiated operation 60 percent
[11347.24s -> 11349.99s]  I feel like I was supposed to mess with something
[11349.99s -> 11354.31s]  page 109 initiated load suggestion motor control
[11355.50s -> 11357.50s]  44.1
[11362.86s -> 11367.93s]  The signal's too low resist
[11370.62s -> 11373.91s]  The signal is too weak. We'll get nothing
[11378.97s -> 11383.45s]  100 percent
[11385.66s -> 11390.14s]  Is the meter on the right it's safe don't resist
[11396.15s -> 11403.23s]  100 percent I can't say continuing experiment h 109 volt meter. Should I watch should I watch the volt meter?
[11420.84s -> 11426.97s]  100 let's go
[11427.53s -> 11429.53s]  Is
[11437.77s -> 11439.77s]  Voltage is getting too high
[11450.94s -> 11462.83s]  We're going to a hundred and fifty percent attack him with the soda
[11463.31s -> 11475.60s]  Became to be without pain calling it quits hush. You need rest. Okay. Okay a short break
[11480.35s -> 11489.77s]  What the fuck how did I did it wrong
[11500.41s -> 11504.49s]  link impulse drink point zero two two to defining a moment so
[11505.21s -> 11507.21s]  Do I have to overload? I have to overload his chair
[11508.68s -> 11513.40s]  Because I I definitely have to overload the chair. Hold on the same that calibration unit in the other room
[11513.40s -> 11519.10s]  I'm supposed to wait. What I was doing it, right?
[11520.84s -> 11523.15s]  Wait, what?
[11523.15s -> 11525.15s]  You can't do it on the first one
[11525.23s -> 11526.43s]  Oh
[11526.43s -> 11527.39s]  Okay
[11527.39s -> 11533.56s]  Run simulation an experiment. I need to do it. Uh, I thought if that was it like, oh well, we'll try it again
[11533.72s -> 11535.72s]  I thought we were resetting his encounter
[11535.88s -> 11540.54s]  Oh, okay. I thought I I needed to do something else
[11550.81s -> 11552.81s]  ADHD dumb fuck
[11554.73s -> 11558.00s]  Jesus
[11560.73s -> 11574.70s]  He's ready for you hush he looks strong good specimen to conclude this phase so
[11575.74s -> 11581.66s]  The test subject came to his senses. I see. Hi good. Just delay. Yes
[11582.38s -> 11585.58s]  We're about to perform the final test of this project
[11588.38s -> 11592.46s]  All right, sit down let's get it saved right before he sits down so I can just not have to do this again
[11592.54s -> 11597.84s]  Because something screws the fuck up. Okay sick. Yeah sick sick sick sick sick. Yeah sick
[11602.94s -> 11616.20s]  Take a seat ready when you generally let's start at 100 signal strength 100 percent. I mean
[11619.80s -> 11624.86s]  200 percent
[11624.86s -> 11630.68s]  60 percent is minimum. We'll get no motor control below and wasting my time but
[11631.32s -> 11636.92s]  60 log concluding experiment page 109 initiated we talked yesterday about
[11638.36s -> 11642.44s]  Going into a vr headset and controlling somebody else like an avatar in the real world
[11644.80s -> 11646.80s]  This is that this is what he wants to do
[11664.97s -> 11673.71s]  Wow, you're paying attention ban that person for six days six days in dog years
[11673.79s -> 11683.26s]  It can cause you real physics it's safe you're strong you can overcome it
[11684.53s -> 11693.44s]  100 percent do it log continuing experiment h 109 run calibration. Yeah, that'd be about that'd be about four hours
[11694.40s -> 11696.40s]  It's like an hour. Yeah
[11713.06s -> 11715.06s]  You're fucking nuts
[11717.23s -> 11726.38s]  It's too much it's too much it's too much
[11734.69s -> 11739.95s]  He is a strong one and you banned me for a little bit. It's a sex thing
[11741.33s -> 11743.33s]  Do not ban that person
[11758.98s -> 11763.54s]  Came to be without pain. I'm calling it. Nothing can stop the blob
[11764.26s -> 11767.95s]  Okay, okay a short break
[11768.83s -> 11770.83s]  I'll return with a clear head
[11771.49s -> 11776.40s]  God damn that assistant if they up the signal it will kill him. Oh
[11777.20s -> 11779.20s]  You need to be the assistant
[11781.52s -> 11784.64s]  I'll stick around
[11784.64s -> 11786.64s]  We need to get rid of I thought I just took a gun out
[11791.20s -> 11793.20s]  Oh, we need to be the assistant
[11795.92s -> 11802.14s]  No, increase the power
[11802.14s -> 11804.38s]  Increase power increase the power level increase power
[11805.18s -> 11808.06s]  Jack up power to way higher than than we can allow
[11809.15s -> 11812.26s]  Tons of power put the power up
[11812.26s -> 11814.48s]  Jack up the power
[11814.48s -> 11816.34s]  Just wait
[11816.34s -> 11820.77s]  What do you mean? Just wait
[11820.77s -> 11839.14s]  Kill the assistant. It's definitely I definitely mess with the server room or something
[11839.38s -> 11843.06s]  That has to be what I have to do. All right, I mean look at that power. We need more power power
[11855.98s -> 11858.93s]  God he is dumb
[11858.93s -> 11862.35s]  What?
[11862.35s -> 11868.58s]  Mm-hmm. Wait, is this the assistant?
[11869.30s -> 11882.98s]  Where's the assistant?
[11882.98s -> 11896.18s]  This is the assistant right here. You're pretending he's pretending again. Uh-oh
[11906.91s -> 11913.63s]  Let me read this sister lay has been pushing for hush to go further than advisable in his testing
[11913.63s -> 11919.10s]  But his personal assistant has convinced him. It's too dangerous if testing is to proceed
[11919.84s -> 11925.22s]  That assistant might need to be taken care of the assistant needs to die
[11935.22s -> 11940.30s]  so
[11940.30s -> 11943.46s]  We need the assistant now. Give me a hand here
[11945.68s -> 11947.68s]  I think it's bugged out. Is it? No, it's not
[11952.08s -> 11954.08s]  All right. So
[11954.08s -> 11956.58s]  All right. So
[11956.58s -> 11962.98s]  All right. So why are you writing that?
[11962.98s -> 11965.87s]  You already failed it
[11965.87s -> 11967.87s]  The other lady not the one doing that. Yeah, I know but
[11968.43s -> 11982.42s]  If we had missed the opportunity to you should have gotten up by now. This is a legit bug
[11983.14s -> 11989.04s]  Oh
[11989.04s -> 11995.47s]  Is it 13?
[11995.47s -> 11997.37s]  1936
[11997.43s -> 12012.70s]  1840 he's supposed to get up. It's not bugged. I think I broke it
[12018.08s -> 12019.68s]  Shoot him and run
[12019.68s -> 12046.30s]  I'm not gonna do that. Like we did the last one just shoot him and run. Okay, so is it actually bugged?
[12047.87s -> 12052.52s]  It's not bugged. Why are you guys are people just gaslighting me? Am I getting gaslighted?
[12054.01s -> 12073.61s]  He's literally supposed to get up. I mean, there's only three people. You know what? Let's just try this you got up
[12087.95s -> 12090.27s]  You're gonna be part of something truly amazing
[12090.99s -> 12092.99s]  He's a genius
[12097.47s -> 12100.86s]  It actually did bug oh
[12101.66s -> 12105.50s]  Actually had to get up if you could just go along with it, okay
[12106.30s -> 12109.50s]  Don't try to resist the impulses he sends
[12110.38s -> 12112.70s]  I don't want him to exert himself
[12113.74s -> 12115.74s]  Can you do that?
[12131.87s -> 12134.83s]  That's the most brutal thing i've ever seen
[12144.33s -> 12146.33s]  Oh my god my stomach
[12148.41s -> 12149.69s]  Okay
[12149.69s -> 12167.05s]  It's time to do the test again get to the skies. No, I have to be the patient
[12174.11s -> 12177.82s]  Wait, why are you doing that?
[12178.14s -> 12192.92s]  I hit an enrage timer. What happened save save it save save save save save. It's good. Just wait
[12194.14s -> 12196.54s]  I have to wait up here. You're gonna make me sit up here
[12197.18s -> 12201.04s]  I you I have to sit up here and not do anything stupid
[12208.52s -> 12210.52s]  Oh my god, are you kidding me?
[12210.84s -> 12226.14s]  These people are gonna wake up by the time he gets back. Just make some noise in the meantime. Okay, that's yeah
[12226.14s -> 12228.14s]  Sure. What do I have? I have a meaty bone
[12236.83s -> 12239.15s]  Sorry, excuse me. You're not allowed here, you know
[12241.08s -> 12255.79s]  You know what the best part about that was
[12255.79s -> 12292.60s]  That yeah, it didn't make any noise. I hit him with like the meat part. What's wrong? Is the gun I need help here
[12293.00s -> 12301.24s]  I couldn't fucking wait. I couldn't I couldn't wait. I couldn't wait. I couldn't wait. I couldn't wait. I couldn't wait
[12301.32s -> 12305.84s]  I couldn't wait. I couldn't fucking wait. I couldn't wait
[12307.48s -> 12318.80s]  I'm gonna take my hands off. I'm gonna take my hands off the mouse and shit. Well, I did wait
[12318.96s -> 12321.52s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, let me give it. I gotta take some credit here
[12322.52s -> 12327.00s]  I didn't know that walking by this guy would make him immediately be like hey get back here
[12327.40s -> 12330.76s]  So I had to hit him in the face of the meat and I and I had to improvise so I dragged him into
[12330.76s -> 12332.36s]  The thing and I've left the gun
[12332.36s -> 12344.33s]  I'm not moving not going anywhere
[12344.33s -> 12346.33s]  You were fine when you took a step back
[12346.72s -> 12357.68s]  Idiot call me an idiot. How dare you? That was my day. My day is going pretty well
[12358.62s -> 12362.14s]  First thing I see in chat doesn't matter what it is. It doesn't even if it's an unedible. I'm gonna eat it for dinner
[12362.14s -> 12370.64s]  What is it?
[12370.64s -> 12373.13s]  ass
[12373.53s -> 12375.53s]  No, the first thing was burger
[12376.27s -> 12381.77s]  Excellent. Hey, you know a burger could be ass
[12382.41s -> 12384.49s]  It could be
[12384.49s -> 12388.01s]  Right. It's ground beef that could be like ass. So
[12388.65s -> 12406.84s]  I'm good. Here we go
[12406.84s -> 12408.84s]  And it's between two buns. Yeah
[12409.48s -> 12413.13s]  That's that's fine
[12413.13s -> 12414.97s]  Don't load save
[12414.97s -> 12419.45s]  All right, let's go
[12422.09s -> 12425.29s]  Push yourself harder
[12430.33s -> 12434.97s]  Yes, 100 percent I feel strong I can take him
[12440.08s -> 12440.96s]  um
[12440.96s -> 12444.78s]  So does 47 just have some type of power where he can resist this dude?
[12446.65s -> 12450.89s]  I didn't do anything special. Like i'm just 47. He's going into my head and stuff
[12453.85s -> 12455.85s]  I hope his head explodes
[12456.81s -> 12463.29s]  What does that say on the safe and then gamer he's gonna go full gamer mode or something I don't understand what's that mean
[12472.04s -> 12486.59s]  So I should just let him do it oh resist nope safe
[12489.00s -> 12491.37s]  The way we have to build it up. Okay
[12504.12s -> 12509.88s]  47 has a huile brain
[12516.57s -> 12521.26s]  Experiment h 109 calibration 120
[12522.14s -> 12524.78s]  I have to wait like right to the very end and then pull it
[12528.30s -> 12530.30s]  That was a plus two chat joke it was
[12539.10s -> 12543.56s]  Let's go his head's gonna explode you're gonna get to see the head explosion part
[12565.31s -> 12570.46s]  Brain blast both targets down good
[12571.26s -> 12573.02s]  Give me a second
[12573.02s -> 12576.30s]  And i'm in you can now access the core 47
[12583.61s -> 12585.61s]  I'm fine, by the way
[12586.86s -> 12599.55s]  Okay, I need the data core are there so many I don't know which one is which

[12757.98s -> 12761.74s]  I would be they put it on the table with some tape and it'd be on a table as a placemat
[12762.30s -> 12766.01s]  I didn't do that to you
[12766.01s -> 12768.01s]  Okay, I need that data core
[12768.01s -> 12780.38s]  You save it. All right, so we gotta keep going down. It's all the way down
[12785.21s -> 12787.85s]  It's a placemat
