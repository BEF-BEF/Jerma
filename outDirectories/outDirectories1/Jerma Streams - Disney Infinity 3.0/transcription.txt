[0.82s -> 7.14s]  Disney Infinity 3.0. Those of you that don't know, I said to somebody, somebody said,
[7.14s -> 11.14s]  hey would you ever play Disney Infinity 3.0? And I said I would rather show my asshole on stream.
[16.92s -> 26.17s]  So, I guess I would rather do this. I have no idea what this game is. I have absolutely no clue.
[26.17s -> 32.74s]  I just know that somebody said, dude play Disney Infinity 3.0. And it just hard crashed.
[36.25s -> 49.38s]  Disney Infinity 3.0 is not responding. Let's try that again. Disney Infinity 3.0 Gold Edition.
[50.10s -> 62.57s]  Okay. Can I put, this is taking over my whole computer. It's on the, okay I have three monitors.
[62.57s -> 78.79s]  It's on that monitor now. Over there. Why is it on the other monitor? This game uses an auto
[78.79s -> 83.11s]  save feature. Do not power off the system while this icon is shown. Streaming videos not rated
[83.11s -> 93.22s]  by local rating boards. What? What does that mean? There are videos on here that have not been rated?
[93.22s -> 97.32s]  Is that what it means? Or does it mean that it's, if you're watching a stream of somebody
[97.32s -> 103.32s]  play this like me, that's not rated? I, you can't see it but I don't want it on this monitor.
[115.78s -> 120.42s]  I'm trying to capture the game.
[130.68s -> 150.26s]  Give me a sec. God, I can't move it. How do I move this fucking thing? Why are there no options? How
[150.26s -> 168.26s]  do I move this to another monitor? Shift and arrow key. Windows shift arrow key. That did not do
[168.26s -> 184.04s]  anything. That ruined everything. I have, it's a mess now. It's a fucking mess. I can't move it.
[184.04s -> 199.18s]  I'm just gonna play it on the other monitor. It's not, the game's not even being captured either.
[199.18s -> 242.74s]  So get it. So capture it. It's not gonna happen. This game was, okay they made this game for like
[242.74s -> 248.94s]  consoles and then they just, they just dragged the folder over to a CD and then they were just like,
[248.94s -> 260.22s]  just to do that. That's it. There's no options. I can't do anything. Alt plus enter to switch
[260.22s -> 280.60s]  window mode. It's not working. It can't even, okay I'm done. That was Disney Infinity 3.0.
[281.90s -> 287.10s]  Game can't fucking be played and streamed. It has to be played on a monitor that it chooses.
[289.02s -> 301.02s]  So I'm gonna get up and show my asshole on camera. What if I, hold on, let me try this.
[305.67s -> 318.49s]  Yeah, we won. We win. I'm gonna try this one more time. It's on this monitor now. It's okay,
[318.49s -> 341.34s]  it's on the right monitor but it won't capture. Capture it. Dude, and now it's on, I'm done.
[341.90s -> 365.19s]  Fuck this game. Wait, I'm, okay count to 30. I want everyone to count to 30 because in 30 seconds
[365.19s -> 369.27s]  I'm moving on to the next game and that was fun. I played Disney Infinity 3.0. It was a fun game.
[371.22s -> 397.75s]  Count to 30 seconds. It's not capturable and it's fucked up again. Yeah, fuck this game.
[399.03s -> 404.87s]  No, no thanks. No thanks. Fuck that stupid ass game. Okay, I'm done. That was fun. Cool.
[404.87s -> 408.07s]  I'm uninstalling it right now. Literally manage. Uninstall.
