[0.31s -> 15.82s]  The heart of Atlantis is power beyond belief, forged by the greatest civilization ever to walk the earth.
[15.82s -> 17.82s]  Whoa, dude, you need to chill out.
[17.82s -> 19.82s]  It has to be.
[19.82s -> 21.82s]  You gotta calm down and take your sand raider with you.
[21.82s -> 25.13s]  From fucking Star Wars in the background.
[25.13s -> 26.75s]  You!
[26.75s -> 29.02s]  Let's go.
[29.02s -> 32.71s]  What?
[32.71s -> 33.71s]  It's an evil pharaoh.
[33.71s -> 37.04s]  What the hell is he doing?
[37.04s -> 39.92s]  He's like, oh god, I can't see.
[39.92s -> 41.92s]  Oh, fuck you, dude.
[41.92s -> 42.92s]  Come on, dude.
[42.92s -> 43.92s]  Put that thing down.
[43.92s -> 45.92s]  I'm just an evil pharaoh guy.
[45.92s -> 46.92s]  I just wanna swing a sword.
[46.92s -> 47.92s]  God damn it.
[47.92s -> 49.92s]  Would you just stop it, man?
[49.92s -> 52.63s]  Where is he?
[52.63s -> 53.63s]  Where are you?
[53.63s -> 54.63s]  I know I'm gonna find you.
[54.63s -> 55.63s]  When I find you, you're gonna die.
[55.63s -> 56.63s]  I swear to god, dude.
[56.63s -> 57.63s]  There you are.
[57.63s -> 58.63s]  There you are.
[58.63s -> 59.63s]  You thought you could get away from me?
[59.63s -> 60.63s]  You thought you could escape the mummy?
[60.63s -> 61.63s]  Oh, dude.
[61.63s -> 62.63s]  Oh, come on, man.
[62.63s -> 63.63s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[63.63s -> 64.63s]  I can't see.
[64.63s -> 65.63s]  Oh, what the hell?
[65.63s -> 66.63s]  Tell him to put the light down.
[66.63s -> 67.63s]  We're just playing.
[67.63s -> 70.90s]  This is the dumbest thing ever.
[70.90s -> 76.23s]  I feel bad for this guy.
[76.23s -> 78.92s]  You burn him with the light?
[88.88s -> 90.88s]  Is he dead?
[90.88s -> 95.76s]  Dude, life sucks for this guy right now.
[95.76s -> 100.69s]  This guy is just having a...
[100.69s -> 103.89s]  Yeah, you'll be fine.
[103.89s -> 107.60s]  You're obviously not slipping.
[107.60s -> 108.60s]  I got you.
[108.60s -> 109.60s]  Don't worry about it.
[109.60s -> 111.93s]  Whoa.
[111.93s -> 113.30s]  What?
[113.30s -> 115.30s]  Oh, we're sliding down this right now?
[115.30s -> 117.30s]  It's like a big schneid.
[118.30s -> 122.18s]  Look, you can see my little elf shoes.
[122.18s -> 128.58s]  Why do I have like little elf cowboy boots on?
[128.58s -> 129.58s]  Oh, no.
[129.58s -> 132.14s]  Are these guys enemies?
[132.14s -> 135.14s]  Is everybody an enemy?
[135.14s -> 139.37s]  Are you serious right now?
[139.37s -> 145.88s]  What just killed him?
[145.88s -> 146.88s]  Who shot him?
[146.88s -> 147.88s]  Did he get just friendly fired?
[147.88s -> 148.88s]  I think he did.
[148.88s -> 151.72s]  Watch it.
[151.72s -> 152.72s]  Watch it.
[152.72s -> 153.96s]  Mummy's to your right.
[153.96s -> 154.96s]  Don't worry.
[154.96s -> 155.96s]  I got this.
[155.96s -> 156.96s]  I'll flashlight him.
[156.96s -> 157.96s]  I'm gonna do the flashlight and you guys take care of him with the...
[157.96s -> 158.96s]  What are you doing?
[158.96s -> 159.96s]  Don't get that close.
[159.96s -> 161.96s]  This guy's a fucking idiot.
[161.96s -> 163.96s]  Why are you getting that close?
[163.96s -> 164.96s]  You guys...
[164.96s -> 169.38s]  Who would ever get that close to a mummy?
[169.38s -> 171.87s]  Who would ever do that?
[171.87s -> 179.04s]  Well, that's a pretty large machine gun.
[179.04s -> 181.94s]  No.
[181.94s -> 182.94s]  No, we're not doing it like this.
[182.94s -> 183.94s]  We're not doing it like this.
[183.94s -> 185.94s]  We're gonna see if I can use the light on people too.
[185.94s -> 189.44s]  Can I be the annoying flashlight guy on people?
[189.44s -> 191.44s]  You really can.
[191.44s -> 195.44s]  You seriously can be the annoying flashlight guy on...
[195.44s -> 200.29s]  Oh, fuck.
[200.29s -> 203.72s]  He's aiming it down here at my face.
[203.72s -> 204.72s]  What?
[204.72s -> 209.86s]  This guy apparently made his way to Hoff, which is interesting.
[209.86s -> 213.55s]  Where's the AT-ATs?
[213.55s -> 218.48s]  Where's the serial AT-ATs?
[218.48s -> 219.48s]  What is that?
[219.48s -> 221.94s]  What?
[221.94s -> 223.69s]  What?
[223.69s -> 225.69s]  Did I walk over another one of those mines?
[225.69s -> 226.69s]  Or the tripwire things?
[226.69s -> 229.06s]  No, there wasn't anything on the ground.
[229.06s -> 230.06s]  What?
[230.06s -> 233.26s]  I need to be sure about this.
[233.26s -> 238.26s]  Another one of those tripmines killed me when I was looking at the freak baby things sitting on the table.
[239.69s -> 242.12s]  Why is this place booby-trapped?
[242.12s -> 244.12s]  What have they got to hide?
[244.12s -> 245.42s]  Like, seriously?
[245.42s -> 248.94s]  Okay, that hurt.
[248.94s -> 252.78s]  No, there is not one of those in here.
[252.78s -> 256.88s]  Oh, it's...
[256.88s -> 257.88s]  Who did that?
[257.88s -> 262.25s]  Who does that and who's stupid enough to walk into it?
[262.25s -> 263.25s]  Apparently me.
[263.25s -> 268.74s]  I guess I'm dumb enough to find, like, Buddha.
[268.74s -> 271.11s]  Whatever this is.
[271.11s -> 272.11s]  You see him?
[272.11s -> 273.11s]  I can't really see him.
[273.11s -> 275.11s]  He's down here somewhere, though.
[276.11s -> 277.11s]  Well, just keep firing down there.
[277.11s -> 278.11s]  You've got to be able to find him.
[278.11s -> 280.11s]  We need to get this kill.
[280.11s -> 282.42s]  I can't even tell where I'm shooting.
[282.42s -> 283.42s]  Can you help me here?
[283.42s -> 284.42s]  I can't...
[284.42s -> 285.42s]  He's right next to you!
[285.42s -> 286.42s]  What?
[286.42s -> 288.42s]  What are you...
[288.42s -> 301.36s]  Are we just not realizing what he just did?
[301.36s -> 304.36s]  He's just like Incredible Hulk through a steel door.
[304.36s -> 307.36s]  And they're having just a general conversation.
[314.36s -> 315.36s]  You heard the man.
[315.36s -> 318.36s]  Name is the era of Waffle Router.
[318.36s -> 323.86s]  You don't know how to speak that language, idiot.
[323.86s -> 327.25s]  Put down your waffles.
[327.25s -> 331.25s]  Oh, that was such a funny joke.
[331.25s -> 332.25s]  Afraid of heights?
[332.25s -> 334.25s]  Not until I saw that rope.
[334.25s -> 335.25s]  No offense, Doc.
[335.25s -> 337.25s]  But we have no time for a detour.
[337.25s -> 339.25s]  I'll go first and prove it safe.
[339.25s -> 342.62s]  Oh, someone's shining a light in my face.
[342.62s -> 346.93s]  See?
[346.93s -> 347.93s]  How do you like it?
[347.93s -> 352.13s]  How do you like having your eyes blinded by something?
[352.13s -> 354.37s]  It sucks, doesn't it?
[354.37s -> 363.26s]  So I have found Han Solo from Star Wars when he's in like the steel glue shit.
[363.26s -> 365.26s]  He has Luke Skywalker's lightsaber.
[365.26s -> 366.26s]  This is not canon.
[366.26s -> 368.57s]  This didn't happen in Star Wars.
[368.57s -> 369.57s]  That's a...
[369.57s -> 371.57s]  Look at this replica of a lightsaber.
[371.57s -> 372.57s]  We'll see.
[372.57s -> 375.06s]  We'll try to get him out of there and see what he has to say.
[375.06s -> 383.62s]  Han Solo, it's time to let you out of your chamber.
[383.62s -> 387.22s]  Give us the secrets of the Millennium Falcon.
[387.22s -> 388.22s]  Oh, God.
[388.22s -> 389.22s]  What's with the light, dude?
[389.22s -> 390.22s]  What the...
[390.22s -> 391.22s]  Oh!
[391.22s -> 392.22s]  Oh, what's going on?
[392.22s -> 393.22s]  Don't shoot me!
[393.22s -> 394.22s]  I'm just gonna have to fucking go!
[394.22s -> 395.22s]  Oh, please!
[395.22s -> 396.22s]  I'm just gonna let you...
[396.22s -> 397.22s]  Where's Leia?
[397.22s -> 398.22s]  Ah!
[398.22s -> 399.22s]  Ah!
[399.22s -> 400.22s]  Ah!
[400.22s -> 401.22s]  Ah!
[401.22s -> 402.22s]  Ah!
[402.22s -> 403.22s]  Ah!
[403.22s -> 404.22s]  Ah!
[404.22s -> 405.22s]  Ah!
[405.22s -> 406.22s]  Ah!
[406.22s -> 407.22s]  Ah!
[407.22s -> 408.22s]  Ah!
