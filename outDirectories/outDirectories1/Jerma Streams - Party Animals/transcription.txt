[33.98s -> 40.86s]  Going on, you know, a lot of happy birthdays. Appreciate that. Thanks for the birthday wishes.
[45.64s -> 59.98s]  33. It's good to be 33. I'm not almost 40. You know what I mean? So today I've got a few things
[59.98s -> 66.76s]  to talk about. Let's go over some things. I might sound a little different. That's okay.
[68.70s -> 78.02s]  I have changed setups. You're not going to believe where I am right now. I could tell you where I am
[78.82s -> 83.38s]  but you wouldn't believe me, but I don't have the camera set up to prove what's going on.
[84.87s -> 95.19s]  I am lying on the ground right now. Isn't that interesting? I got like a beanbag chair.
[95.19s -> 99.51s]  I'm like lying on the ground. I've got a set. I'm like lying down and playing today.
[100.31s -> 110.25s]  This is gonna be awesome. This is gonna be so cool. I can't wait. Is he zonked? No,
[111.53s -> 121.86s]  I am absolutely sober, but I'm going into full relaxation mode today. Can you show us? I'll
[121.86s -> 127.66s]  probably set a camera up here and then I don't know if this is permanent. So this could be
[127.66s -> 131.18s]  pretty temporary, but I, you know, I just felt like today I'm like, you know what?
[132.62s -> 137.02s]  I want to like lie down and just, well, I'm not lying on my back. Let's be really honest and clear
[137.02s -> 142.30s]  here. I'm sitting up, but I'm sitting in like a beanbag chair. It's a, it's not a beanbag chair.
[142.30s -> 158.76s]  I keep making that up, but I am reclined. He's in a hospital bed. I have really retired. Yeah.
[158.76s -> 167.14s]  I'm screaming from the, you know, retirement home. Don't fall asleep. No, if anything,
[167.14s -> 173.32s]  this is going to be, I feel like this is going to be better to stream from. I can just sit back now.
[174.04s -> 178.81s]  All right. Let's, let's do real talk for a second. I actually have a lot of trouble,
[178.81s -> 181.53s]  which I've been realizing lately, the last like, I want to say two or three years.
[182.33s -> 188.92s]  I know it has a lot to do with the chest and back problem, but sitting up,
[189.72s -> 195.61s]  does anybody else hate sitting up in a chair? Sitting straight up with like my arms up is,
[195.61s -> 201.13s]  it causes a lot of pain in, especially nowadays. So I was like, you know what? I'm going to try it.
[201.13s -> 204.65s]  I'm going to try just lying down, like sitting down, sitting back, reclining.
[205.62s -> 214.20s]  This is a trial run. Let's see how it goes. Yeah. It's going to be back. You can play CS2. I don't
[214.20s -> 224.62s]  think so. It's way better. Well, if you're sitting up, you want your posture to be good,
[225.66s -> 233.10s]  but if you're leaning back a little and put my knees up, I bet you in an hour, I talk about how
[233.10s -> 240.17s]  much I hate this. I'm going to be leaning back like this with, and I'm just going to be like,
[240.17s -> 246.74s]  I hate this. All right. Give me one second. Let me, I just want to grab a drink. Be right back.
[333.38s -> 342.54s]  Okay. I got my drink. So is this game any good? I saw this game being played. It looked really fun.
[343.35s -> 350.46s]  Is it fun? It looks good. What are you drinking? Something really weird.
[351.02s -> 364.07s]  It's a sun-kissed berry lemonade. We're going full recline streamer mode now. It's all right.
[364.07s -> 379.37s]  It's pretty good. Going complete food mode. All right. So what, let's go. All right. So what,
[379.37s -> 385.83s]  what's the best character? Who should I play as? Do they have stats or is it just, they're just
[385.83s -> 393.19s]  characters? What about Resident Evil 4 DLC? Oh yeah. A hundred percent. Maybe not, not today.
[396.22s -> 406.70s]  Do the otter? I just burped wicked loud. I really am retired. Did that come through the mic?
[406.70s -> 420.50s]  That was like, do otter? They're all really cute. They are. I'm going to go. No, no, no.
[425.78s -> 444.57s]  Ooh, ooh. Maybe royalty-free Garfield. Should I be royalty-free Garfield or all right. We're
[444.57s -> 457.50s]  going to go with Lloyd. Do I have this stuff? No, I don't. All right. Well, we'll go Lloyd.
[459.51s -> 466.87s]  So now we just do quick match, right? Is that how this works? You should do dark Lloyd. I can do
[466.87s -> 482.42s]  dark Lloyd. Oh, I don't have enough money. Okay. Well, let's go do the tutorial. All right. Time
[482.42s -> 498.02s]  to play. Do you dye your hair still? It's completely natural. Okay. Left and right.
[502.02s -> 507.06s]  Move on to the next room when you're ready. Let's go. You see that wee thingy that just
[507.06s -> 512.38s]  popped out? It's pretty sloppy. That is the stamina bar. You need stamina to run,
[512.38s -> 516.46s]  attack, climb, or carry things around. Okay, there's the stamina bar. Better keep good
[516.46s -> 521.74s]  track of it at all times. I'm like choking myself. A little run up lets you jump further.
[522.86s -> 530.39s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. So run up. Wait, what did I miss? Easy. All right.
[533.48s -> 537.56s]  You can grab everything in the game. Pick up the green cube thing.
[538.28s -> 542.60s]  Oh, I like lying down and screaming. This is awesome. I'm starting a new trend. Yes,
[542.60s -> 546.92s]  yes. Just like that. Calling it right now. Now, put the cube thing onto the metal pressure
[546.92s -> 555.00s]  sensor to unlock the door. Chop, chop. Right here. Easy. This is maximum chill. That's right.
[556.09s -> 566.12s]  Did I not get it? You didn't invent lying down, but I invented lying down and screaming at the
[566.12s -> 580.54s]  same time. No, I didn't. Okay. All right. All right. What do I do? Hold X to charge
[581.18s -> 592.30s]  and then release. That didn't really work. What do you think invented means?
[594.38s -> 598.46s]  You are the first person to do something. You invented it and then you patented it. See,
[598.46s -> 612.20s]  the problem is I didn't patent this yet. That's what I need to do. Close enough. Yeah.
[613.42s -> 618.30s]  See that punching bag? Time to learn a couple of moves. Yeah, well, there's a punch in the game.
[618.30s -> 625.67s]  A couple of jabs for a start. It automatically just got a full letter grid. Quite a sizable
[625.67s -> 636.15s]  hedge you've got there, don't you? Headbutt. B. Where's Lloyd? This is the tutorial. I don't
[636.15s -> 643.94s]  think Lloyd is in the tutorial. Sorry. Forgot to mention, you can get knocked out by your own
[643.94s -> 648.42s]  attacks from time to time. I won't forget again. It'll be a 10 if there are cars in this game. If
[648.42s -> 659.19s]  there are cars in the game, it's a 10.0. While running? Press X while running. Oh, you mean like
[659.19s -> 673.80s]  this? I feel like this is like a toddler having a tantrum. Those are tantrum arms. Okay. Jump.
[673.80s -> 686.60s]  Wait. I missed. Oh my God. I'm bad at this. All right. Turn this way and do it.
[688.07s -> 693.67s]  Just me, or is there a nice lollipop in the presentation box? Lollipop? Let's break it out.
[695.61s -> 701.75s]  Give me it. Give me this thing. To pick up, wait to align your hands with the handle.
[701.75s -> 706.49s]  All right. Now we... I'm going to like this a lot, I think. All right. How do I use it?
[710.23s -> 716.07s]  To correctly pick the weapon up. Correctly. Like this? This is like this. Okay. Oh, and you can't
[716.07s -> 722.98s]  let go of the grab button. Hit the punching bag with the lollipop. Oh, I'm going to bash somebody's
[722.98s -> 729.85s]  head in with this thing. That's what you're supposed to do, right? I'm going full violence
[729.85s -> 742.79s]  mode and I don't even know if that's what the goal of the game. Double press it. Okay. Hold Y
[742.79s -> 754.68s]  while grabbing the net. Okay. Hold Y. Oh, we have to grab it. Right. Okay. I don't do anything else
[754.68s -> 766.20s]  because it's... Oh, it's automatic. Okay. Let's go. Dodge roll. Are there iframes in this game?
[766.20s -> 780.66s]  Because that would be really funny if there were. Okay. Well, I missed. No. Okay. No. All right.
[780.66s -> 793.75s]  Wait. That was good. Clap for me. Clap. Beat the crocodile. Oh my God. All right. So...
[798.84s -> 808.46s]  Throw him off. What the fuck? I win.
[808.62s -> 813.96s]  That was not too bad at all. Next room. All right. Cool. Whenever you're ready.
[814.52s -> 826.30s]  I got one star. That's pretty good. Except it's not. Why would you want... You're going to give
[826.30s -> 845.99s]  me stars in a tutorial? All right. Quick match. Let's go. I don't have any friends.
[846.55s -> 861.43s]  How come I'm... Where's my... Where's the other character? Am I the dog? Don't ever do that slurp
[861.43s -> 869.05s]  again. Well, now I'm going to do it because you just said not to. Three, two, one.
[872.23s -> 888.28s]  Okay. Choose the map you want to play. How about this one? Does it matter? Don't get carried away
[888.28s -> 903.03s]  by water and stay alive. Oh. Why are you really goofy today? I think that's just who I am, man.
[903.03s -> 921.96s]  That's the worst sound of the year. No, not even close. No way. Oh, here we go. All right. I want
[921.96s -> 927.90s]  to be... I want to be somebody that nobody else is though. Oh, I have streamer mode on. Is that
[927.90s -> 943.14s]  a good thing? Probably. I'll be the duck. So it's all about just beat the shit out of each other.
[943.14s -> 951.35s]  I think that's a great title for a game. Don't you think that's a huge grabber for a title?
[951.91s -> 961.53s]  Beat the shit out of each other. Oh my god. I wasn't even looking. Am I already dead? All right.
[961.53s -> 972.23s]  I'm ready. Okay. That was bad. That was very bad. I'm all right. Am I all right? Get back up here.
[972.23s -> 983.66s]  How do I climb? What? Oh, this is all wear on teams. All right. Enough with that. Give me these.
[983.66s -> 990.98s]  Give me the nunchucks. Oh, now you're in trouble. I'm gonna come. I'm gonna come over here and...
[993.42s -> 1005.08s]  What is wrong with me? What is wrong with my character? Get over here. Get back. Get back. Get back.
[1005.08s -> 1019.27s]  I didn't let go of items? All right. Get rid of them. Shit. We can do it. We can do it. We're fine.
[1019.27s -> 1023.77s]  We're fine. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. What is this?
[1027.10s -> 1032.07s]  Headbutt. Headbutt, right? Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. We have to climb.
[1034.39s -> 1038.60s]  Get off of me. All right. Now, I'll get a step on his fingers when he gets up here.
[1044.98s -> 1058.44s]  Oh, shit. That's bad. No. Wait. I'm all right. I'm all right. Everything's fine. I'm still alive.
[1063.38s -> 1081.40s]  Oh my god. It's... I'm still holding on. Am I still alive? We won. We did it. All right. We're good.
[1082.12s -> 1101.83s]  Smash somebody with a frying pan. This is not how you pick that up. Yeah. Get out of here. Get away
[1101.83s -> 1136.18s]  from me. All right. I have... I have the fry... Oh my god. Get up. Get up. Whoa. Okay. I need to...
[1136.18s -> 1140.50s]  Okay. Should you grab them when they're still alive? Oh, wait. Oh my god. I have an opportunity right now.
[1142.39s -> 1152.04s]  Didn't work. Oh my god. I'm gonna crush him. He's gonna get squished like the juicer. Whatever this
[1152.04s -> 1167.40s]  thing is. He's in like the meat grinder. Oh god. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Oh, I'm unconscious right now.
[1176.04s -> 1191.03s]  Do not hit me with that, please. All right. We're good. Get up. Pick him up with both hands. Yes. I got it.
[1191.59s -> 1195.96s]  All right. Just hold on. Hold on. I'm gonna hold on for... I'm absolutely gonna hold on.
[1196.68s -> 1211.14s]  Who is throwing stuff at my head? We're all wedged into this hole. How did we all get in? No.
[1211.14s -> 1219.78s]  No. No. Grab it. He's holding my head under the water. That's illegal. You can't do that.
[1220.42s -> 1239.16s]  That's illegal. Oh, boy. There's no more boat. Oh. All right. I get it now. Let's go. Oh, shit. My
[1239.16s -> 1247.14s]  headphones fell out. Sorry. They're not paying attention. Should you always go for like running
[1247.14s -> 1253.35s]  kicks or what? Baseball bat. Give it to me. No. What am I doing? Just get up there now.
[1254.23s -> 1267.26s]  Shouldn't I climb to the very top right now? You piece of shit. Don't get eliminated immediately,
[1267.26s -> 1287.70s]  really. What just happened to me? What was that? What just happened? Oh. I only had three. I had
[1287.70s -> 1302.31s]  two. Did I spend all my coins? All right. Wait. Wait. Wait. I'm gonna throw a coin at this guy.
[1305.30s -> 1317.16s]  Oh, I just missed. Oh, they're in trouble now. All right. Okay. Here we go. Ready?
[1319.78s -> 1324.74s]  That's not where I just aimed. Why did it go all the way up here? My crosshair was right here.
[1328.57s -> 1342.44s]  Garfield's on your team. Oh, whoops. Here we go. Nice. Very, very nice. Ah, shit. Garfield's got it.
[1349.66s -> 1369.30s]  Don't let him take you in there. Right in the face. I don't want to throw this. I'm afraid I'll hurt
[1369.30s -> 1391.08s]  him. Dude, that was like a snipe, bro. Nevermind. Damn it. I'm so bad at this. Take the shot. That
[1391.08s -> 1402.92s]  was really close though, you have to admit. Where are they? All right. Did we win? All right. No.
[1402.92s -> 1407.08s]  All right. Let's go. Okay. Okay. I'm ready. Ready. Garfield, we're gonna get this right now.
[1407.80s -> 1420.97s]  Check this out. I got a gun now. Pick it up with both hands. Start whacking people.
[1428.60s -> 1437.58s]  Get over here. All right. At least I scared him. I almost just walked into the fucking like,
[1438.38s -> 1455.22s]  hold on. Oh, how do I pick them up? How do you pick people up? How do you pick people? How do
[1455.22s -> 1460.10s]  I let go of the bat? Isn't it right? Oh, it's double tap right trigger. That's why I was just
[1460.10s -> 1477.72s]  tapping right trigger. Just get up. I'm going up right now. Forget about anything else. Yeah. This
[1477.72s -> 1481.88s]  is all that matters. It's just whoever's at the highest point. So who cares? I'm just gonna stand
[1481.88s -> 1494.97s]  at the very top of this thing. Why would you do anything else? Just hold on right here. Don't move.
[1495.53s -> 1513.14s]  Oh, you idiot. No, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on tight. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold
[1513.14s -> 1523.96s]  on. Hold on. Oh, that's bad. I'm good. All right. Just me and you. Ooh, somebody missed big time.
[1525.74s -> 1542.10s]  And no, please get a shot. Beautiful. Unbelievable shot. All right. Just hold,
[1542.10s -> 1553.22s]  hold right here. All right. Am I safe? Yeah, there we go. All right. That's a win. We're good.
[1553.94s -> 1563.50s]  All right. This is it. This is, this is for all the marbles right here. Do not put me into the
[1563.50s -> 1574.54s]  fucking juice machine. I'll put you in there though. Let's go. Oh, it's a rocket comes out.
[1574.54s -> 1579.90s]  I thought it was the thing that opens and just crushes whoever's in there. Oh, it does both.
[1579.90s -> 1597.83s]  Okay. That's whatever. Ooh. See you later. Get over here. Why would a submarine have that? I
[1597.83s -> 1610.02s]  don't know. It's a goofy cartoon game. As long as I, I'm doing the same strat I did last time.
[1611.32s -> 1635.18s]  Seriously. Why is he going so slow? He's so, why did I do that? No, don't even think about it.
[1643.37s -> 1649.05s]  What did you just threw it to me? And I pick, I, I, what? I caught it. Put it down. Why did I pick,
[1649.05s -> 1664.65s]  I caught it out of the air. I didn't mean to do that. I think it just ran into the pole. Oh my
[1664.65s -> 1673.02s]  God. What am I doing? Why did I do that? Honestly, if as long as blue doesn't win, that was bad.
[1675.32s -> 1693.72s]  Oh, that's not good. It's very bad. Well, as long as blue doesn't win, we're good. All right. I
[1693.72s -> 1705.94s]  gotta help. Hey, we did it. Nice. Is that, that's worth, is that worth something? Nice job,
[1705.94s -> 1717.53s]  Garfield. You did it. I don't know why. I just, I don't know. That, that character, that character
[1717.53s -> 1723.34s]  had a punchable face. That character had a punchable face. That just went right. By the way,
[1724.87s -> 1729.90s]  what is up with that? Have you guys ever noticed that like, oh, that, oh yeah, that guy has a
[1729.90s -> 1737.51s]  wicked punchable face. Why is like your first impression of somebody to physically assault
[1741.37s -> 1752.46s]  them? What, what's up with that? Oh, it took a picture. I see. Your face is punchable.
[1753.50s -> 1757.30s]  But you know what I mean? Like, oh yeah, yeah. That guy's got a wicked punchable face.
[1759.29s -> 1763.45s]  You're already like having a fantasy of beating this person up. You don't even know who this
[1763.45s -> 1782.28s]  person is. You just said it though. I was setting up the joke. I was going to bring that up like
[1782.28s -> 1795.10s]  two weeks ago. All right. What's up? What's the fun one? Winter is, oh, well I guess we don't
[1795.10s -> 1811.11s]  even have a choice. Is anybody, is people saying play with other people? Is that, I know this is
[1811.11s -> 1816.07s]  like a multiplayer game and everything, but I kind of just wanted to try it. I don't know how
[1816.07s -> 1821.27s]  long I'm going to play this game for. So I don't, I mean, I know I might be here for playing this
[1821.27s -> 1825.91s]  game for like an hour or two or three, but I don't know if I want to be like, Hey everybody,
[1825.91s -> 1833.56s]  let's do it. And then like 20 minutes later, I'm like, yeah, I'm kind of done. All right. This is
[1833.56s -> 1854.63s]  really fun though. I like it. All right. So we just have to stay alive. Wait, wait. Oh, it's not
[1854.63s -> 1861.38s]  stay alive. It's okay. I was being it. Okay. It's not stay alive. It's, I didn't pay attention at
[1861.38s -> 1869.16s]  all. All right. So you have to score a goal in a circle. Sorry. All right. I get it now. It's
[1869.16s -> 1871.88s]  the first time I've played it. Okay. I'm going to go. Don't wait. You'll never be the first person
[1871.88s -> 1884.60s]  that runs for the dodge ball. All right. That's fine. What is, what goal is ours? Because that's
[1884.60s -> 1892.10s]  incredibly embarrassing if I don't do it the right way. What goal is ours? What team am I on?
[1892.66s -> 1915.43s]  What team am I on? Blue team. All right. Good. Oh, right. It's right up over our heads.
[1915.99s -> 1927.64s]  Okay. So we want to score on that goal in front of us. I'm really upset that Garfield's not there.
[1928.73s -> 1936.36s]  Oh, it's okay. Yeah. The whole time that it was explaining, I was looking over here,
[1936.36s -> 1948.25s]  talking about the punchable face thing. I wasn't even looking. I'm scoring a goal. Get off me.
[1948.97s -> 1961.19s]  How long did you stay down for? All right. I'm good. Oh, I got it. I got it. I got the ball. I
[1961.19s -> 1964.15s]  got the ball. I got the ball. I got the ball. I got the ball. I got the ball. I got the ball.
[1973.51s -> 1988.79s]  Shit. I tried to drop kick. I like the gorilla. The gorilla's cool. You can move the camera. Oh,
[1988.79s -> 2002.49s]  shit. Right stick, I guess. I just tried to do the same thing and I got hit. Really? We just
[2002.49s -> 2016.79s]  got annihilated. Is it actually five to nothing? What is happening right now? I'm going, I'm jumping
[2016.79s -> 2019.19s]  in and drop kicking immediately. I'm going to do the same thing they just did to me.
[2020.49s -> 2027.90s]  I pressed B instead of A. Let go of me. How do you get somebody to let go of you?
[2036.01s -> 2047.56s]  Okay. How do I stop this guy from doing this? Somebody help. Good. Good. Good. Good.
[2047.56s -> 2075.30s]  Clear shot. Clear shot. Yes. We got one goal. They disconnected. Did they? Do not. Oh my god,
[2075.30s -> 2088.01s]  how? All right. That one needs a little more practice. This gorilla scored, I think,
[2088.01s -> 2114.63s]  all of their goals. No, I want to be right in the middle. What the hell? Is he biting me? He's
[2114.63s -> 2138.52s]  biting me. Did you see Destiny 2's DLC? No. All right. All right. Let's go. Do you like frosty
[2138.52s -> 2142.52s]  flakes? Yeah. Frosted flakes, but it was too long of a name, so I had to get rid of the E and D.
[2143.32s -> 2151.80s]  The name was too long. What about sorcery? We'll go back to sorcery probably in this coming week,
[2152.36s -> 2157.40s]  next week maybe. All right. I want to do beat up bridge 100%. That looks like the absolute best
[2157.40s -> 2178.87s]  one. Stay on the bridge and stay alive. You got it. I think the problem was I wanted to be the
[2178.87s -> 2189.30s]  goose and I was playing as the duck. I think that was, I think that was the mistake. Your
[2189.30s -> 2194.90s]  shout out for frozen red grapes literally changed my life. Thank you. Honest to God. I'm glad to
[2194.90s -> 2202.25s]  hear that. I'm seeing a lot of sames right now. I'm seeing a lot of sames. That's great.
[2202.81s -> 2211.46s]  They hurt my teeth. All right. Let me, let me give you a little bit of a tip. You, this is
[2211.46s -> 2214.82s]  very important. A lot of people that do frozen grapes, they fuck the whole thing up. So listen
[2214.82s -> 2226.41s]  closely. Okay. The grapes, they need to be in the freezer for at least a whole day. This takes a
[2226.41s -> 2231.69s]  whole day. It takes like six plus hours to get, they need to be frozen solid, frozen solid.
[2232.33s -> 2241.78s]  Take them out. And then once they're out, you, I lost. Um, that was okay. Uh, anyways. So what
[2241.78s -> 2251.37s]  were we talking about? Okay. Frozen grapes. Did I actually just lose? Okay. So put them in the
[2251.37s -> 2256.57s]  freezer for at least six to eight hours. If you've frozen solid, when you take them out of the
[2256.57s -> 2261.77s]  freezer, don't just eat them right away. I know it's like, Oh, here they are frozen grapes. Let
[2261.77s -> 2268.17s]  them sit out for 15 to 20 minutes, maybe like 10 minutes. They'll be a little bit softer,
[2268.17s -> 2273.37s]  but still frozen and chewy on the inside. I, it is the greatest snack ever invented.
[2274.01s -> 2284.25s]  I invented it. I just want to make sure that we all can attribute it to me. Did I miss with the
[2284.25s -> 2296.60s]  bomb? Yeah. You invented it. Uh, also somebody said frozen blueberries. And I said, Oh, intriguing.
[2297.24s -> 2319.45s]  I had them. They're wonderful. Why the fuck did I just do that? Okay. Yeah. I will reiterate this
[2319.45s -> 2329.45s]  one more time. Regular grapes. They're not as good to me. And the thought of eating a handful
[2329.45s -> 2334.89s]  of grapes is like, Hmm, that's okay. I cannot get enough of these frozen grapes. I can't get enough
[2334.89s -> 2343.35s]  of them. I have, let me tell you something. I've been to the grocery store three different times
[2344.07s -> 2351.11s]  to get another big container of grapes. The last time before this, that I got a container of grapes,
[2351.91s -> 2357.18s]  I didn't even eat half of them. I don't think. And it's like, Oh shit. I don't like doing that.
[2357.18s -> 2361.90s]  Right. So you buy like the smaller container to make sure I'm buying the big ass container
[2361.90s -> 2366.14s]  and I'm freezing them all. And I'm eating the whole fucking thing. Not in one sitting,
[2366.14s -> 2389.91s]  obviously, but I can do some head butts. Wait, that's not a bad idea. Get away from the bomb.
[2389.91s -> 2398.41s]  He's trying to like put it in my mouth. Why there's so many of these.
[2405.16s -> 2424.31s]  Holy shit. I just did it. And I was unconscious when it happened. Cool. We did it again. No,
[2424.31s -> 2450.30s]  get off me. Thank you so much. You just saved my life. Not good. Oh my God. Why? I just went
[2450.30s -> 2465.24s]  flying. It'll hit somebody, whatever. I'm just dumped my entire drink on me. Yeah. Frozen
[2465.24s -> 2470.92s]  blueberries are awesome, but frozen grapes. Oh my goodness. It just changes everything.
[2474.23s -> 2481.54s]  Speaking of somebody that actually finds it kind of difficult to put fruits into his diet. I can
[2481.54s -> 2487.38s]  do vegetables, right? But there's something about a fruit, like eating an orange or an apple or,
[2487.38s -> 2493.34s]  yeah, I'm going to eat a bunch of melon today. That kind of just doesn't happen. This thing is
[2493.34s -> 2500.20s]  vertical. Bananas are great. I like to blend bananas in a smoothie, but if you're having
[2500.20s -> 2506.52s]  trouble getting fruits in your diet, is it no jokes around? It's a great way to do it.
[2506.52s -> 2526.54s]  Damn it. You should talk about tuna fish again. Okay. So what about the Silent Hill 2 remake?
[2527.18s -> 2541.50s]  Is it out? Remember, you're not even playing the game. I was playing. Watch this. I just,
[2541.50s -> 2560.65s]  he tripped on it. You should try eating a cold orange in the shower. I've had a can of Coke in
[2560.65s -> 2571.88s]  the shower and that was kind of cool. It's been a very long time. I've had a freezing cold,
[2571.88s -> 2576.50s]  like a really ice cold can of Coke. There's something about it. I don't know. I don't
[2576.50s -> 2581.53s]  recommend you do this, but I remember just slurping it down and I didn't even care if
[2581.53s -> 2585.45s]  it got all over me. I didn't even care. It was like, oh yeah, I'm going to slam this.
[2594.49s -> 2601.43s]  I want to pick up the right way. No, you know, I didn't pick it up the right way.
[2602.39s -> 2620.36s]  Why didn't I do that? How come he didn't use his other hand? Yep. Okay. See ya.
[2621.08s -> 2647.66s]  Oh, the tables have turned. Give me the gun. Gun. It's like woke me up.
[2655.21s -> 2666.50s]  Put that down. That's one. Holy shit. We did it. That's another win. That's a,
[2666.50s -> 2674.09s]  that's a W right there. You can call it a cleanup job if you want, but that was still,
[2674.17s -> 2685.61s]  hold on. I just spilt this shit. I'm an idiot. Did I a little bit? Whatever. I'm in the picture. I
[2685.61s -> 2709.24s]  don't care. Play this with Vinny. Thank you so much. She's rescuing me. Yeah, I got it. It's
[2709.24s -> 2717.24s]  good. It's just in my, it's just on my hand. I got to get used to that. I got, I'm a, I'm a,
[2717.24s -> 2739.99s]  I'm a reclined streamer now. Gator Valley. Do this one. Show us the setup. Uh, I didn't really
[2739.99s -> 2745.24s]  have time to put the webcam in, but you'll see it. And you're all going to think I'm
[2745.24s -> 2753.43s]  out of my fucking mind, but it's all right. Cause I'm comfortable here. And who cares people? Uh,
[2753.43s -> 2758.87s]  yeah. My stream set up. I've got all these like lights and I've got like a green screen and I've
[2758.87s -> 2763.18s]  got like stuff. I have like that Reddit shelf, right? Like, Oh, I'm going to put stuff on it.
[2763.18s -> 2767.82s]  I'm everything's on the ground right now. I'm literally on the ground and I kind of like it
[2767.82s -> 2771.82s]  here. I kind of like it just sitting here against like with a beanbag chair. That's not a beanbag
[2771.82s -> 2783.85s]  chair. I don't think I don't, I don't even care. It's fun. I like it. Uh, I'm going to stay with
[2783.85s -> 2794.70s]  the goose. There's nothing quite like being on the floor streamer. Yeah. And God damn it. I wasn't
[2794.70s -> 2805.40s]  even looking. All right. I think we're teams, right? Yeah. It's like a candy factory. Oh,
[2805.40s -> 2825.62s]  we eat the candy, bro. Get off me. Oh, wait, are we taking the, I didn't pay any attention.
[2825.62s -> 2831.32s]  Are we taking the candy back to our base? And in one sentence, what's the goal?
[2835.99s -> 2861.67s]  Steal the candy. Okay. I'm just going to be the muscle.
[2873.75s -> 2878.78s]  Ooh, that was a big one. All right. Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[2879.42s -> 2900.25s]  I am clobbering this dude. Oh my God. I killed him. You can kill people. All right. It's only
[2900.25s -> 2943.85s]  us here. We should be fine. Are we winning? Shit. I'm I'm I helped quite a bit. Actually.
[2944.57s -> 2971.48s]  I, that was, I helped quite a bit. Where am I? Damn it. I got an egg coin. Cool. The rabbits
[2971.48s -> 2982.22s]  are holding hands. Are they kind of remarkable? They actually could go up there is gambling.
[2982.78s -> 2994.55s]  Ooh, really? Okay. Don't tell them about that. Well, it's too late. I already did. Oh man,
[2994.55s -> 3003.72s]  this one looks kind of crazy. Frozen grapes are great, but if you hold on, let me see what you
[3003.72s -> 3010.49s]  said. Combine them with whipped cream. Hold on. I need to know that strat. It looks like somebody
[3010.49s -> 3019.08s]  has a frozen grape strategy. Have you tried carbonating them in a whipped cream dispenser?
[3020.82s -> 3029.42s]  Huh? Carbonated grapes? I don't, I don't even know what that means, but it sounds kind of
[3029.42s -> 3035.51s]  intriguing. You mean like you mash them up and whip them up with a, and then you put them in
[3035.51s -> 3040.07s]  like heavy cream and put them in a dispenser? That actually sounds kind of cool. You can do
[3040.07s -> 3047.99s]  that with like any kind of fruit, right? All right. I got to pay attention. That was,
[3048.55s -> 3060.84s]  I hope that was not a teammate. I don't, it might've been. Ooh, get out of here. Get out of
[3060.84s -> 3074.04s]  here. No. Oh, I freaked out. Oh, that was a victory right there. I freaked out. We still won.
[3074.04s -> 3094.60s]  Oh, I didn't. Oh, that hurt a lot. What if I just stay on the ground? Will anyone come get me? Um,
[3094.60s -> 3122.44s]  who has the electricity? Don't ever give me a weapon. I'm going to stand over here. Oh,
[3122.44s -> 3138.15s]  is there a taunt button? I hope there is. Oh, what is going on? Get off me. There's tasers.
[3149.05s -> 3165.16s]  Can I have some? Pick him up. Pick him up. Oh my God. You have to be fucking kidding me.
[3165.16s -> 3168.28s]  I'm trying to grab him and he just holds on with one hand. Like he's,
[3169.00s -> 3192.57s]  has a fucking little kid's wagon behind him. A whole wagon? Like those little kid wagons that
[3192.65s -> 3208.39s]  you drag. All right, let's stay back here together. Oh, okay. I'm not very good at this.
[3209.03s -> 3225.35s]  I went for a super move and it didn't do anything. Oh man. Oh man. I just wanted to
[3225.35s -> 3234.73s]  punch that guy in the face so bad. There was so much power in that punch. If it hit anybody,
[3234.73s -> 3250.17s]  it would have gotten annihilated. It's getting intense though. Ooh, big kick.
[3255.78s -> 3266.63s]  I mean, we got a 10 out of 10 cameraman here and saw the whole thing. This is a formal request for
[3266.63s -> 3273.03s]  you to play Baldur's Gate. Holly and I have actually been playing it off screen. Not a
[3273.03s -> 3285.62s]  whole lot though. Where am I? Just barely got into it. Oh, hold on. Actually, let me go see
[3285.62s -> 3298.02s]  the other stuff. I can do, I have money now, right? I have like coins or something. Okay,
[3298.02s -> 3314.36s]  level up. I got 1500 cookies and a bacon avatar. Okay, cool. So where are these eggs?
[3314.92s -> 3329.05s]  How do you like it so far? It's really, really, really cool. I like that it's kind of, you just
[3329.05s -> 3333.37s]  can sort of go wherever you want really. There's that, you know, there's a ton of
[3334.17s -> 3338.82s]  main mission storyline stuff, but you can kind of just walk in a direction and just kind of
[3338.82s -> 3354.68s]  do whatever you want. Okay. Surprise eggs. How many do I have? One? Okay. I can do one egg.
[3354.68s -> 3357.88s]  Let's go. Is it worth doing it like this? Or I think this, no, that's end game currency.
[3358.68s -> 3376.41s]  All right. What do we get? Character. I'm playing a, a gnome sorcerer focusing on lightning. Pink
[3376.41s -> 3405.86s]  hammer. Ooh, okay. That's right. Laughing my ass off. That's you. Of course it's always sorcery.
[3405.86s -> 3424.28s]  Well, sorcery is one of my favorite games of all time. I'm going to compare it to sorcery. No,
[3424.28s -> 3437.27s]  I don't want to do this one again. This one was too hard. Can you review the game immediately?
[3438.07s -> 3444.17s]  That might take a long time. I have a feeling that's going to take a little bit.
[3444.73s -> 3454.41s]  I feel like I've seen the amount of the game that amounts to the first preview at the movie
[3454.41s -> 3469.96s]  theater. Well, you're gonna have to give me a little bit. Oh my God. Hell yeah. Did you win
[3469.96s -> 3483.51s]  any F-Zero games? Holly and I have been obsessed with F-Zero 99. I've come in third place overall
[3483.51s -> 3495.58s]  one time. I took a screenshot to prove it just in case anyone didn't believe it. There's a lie.
[3495.58s -> 3504.06s]  Well, it's no, it isn't. It's for real. But realistically at this point I can get into the
[3504.06s -> 3510.87s]  top, like top 15, top 20. Very, very much consistently. Pretty much every time.
[3511.67s -> 3528.95s]  I like this character a lot. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're way stronger. Why?
[3532.39s -> 3538.79s]  Let me up. Pull me up. Pull me up. Come on. Up, up, up, up. Pull us up. Pull us up, dude. Come on. Pull us up.
[3539.35s -> 3560.68s]  Pull us up, dude. Please pull us up. I was trying to let him go, but okay. It's all right. Can I get in the
[3560.68s -> 3586.87s]  cockpit? What the hell was that? Dude, he hit me in the hands and I shot the gun straight in the air.
[3594.22s -> 3621.45s]  Yes. Wait. Yes. Do not get eliminated first. Come on. Thank you, whoever did that. Thank you.
[3621.45s -> 3626.54s]  Actually, thank you very much. I'm a hammerhead. I should be hitting people with the head.
[3634.81s -> 3644.41s]  Get out of here. Oh, I'm on your team. I'm, hey, what are you doing? Why did you do that?
[3645.05s -> 3649.05s]  Why? He just saw red. He just saw red. He didn't even know. I don't think he even knew.
[3649.93s -> 3663.11s]  All right. We're kind of just fucking this guy up. That was revenge. Did I shoot him before? No.
[3664.38s -> 3668.22s]  Revenge? Why are you saying? Wait, really? Oh, no. That's not good. All right. I deserved it.
[3673.27s -> 3689.56s]  That's very, dude, I'm getting carried so hard. You tased him. But all right. But here's the thing.
[3689.56s -> 3695.24s]  I didn't mean to. He meant to punch me in the face and throw me off the ship.
[3695.80s -> 3713.13s]  The person just rolled off. That's a cool skin or whatever it is. What kind of animal is that?
[3713.77s -> 3729.38s]  I want to see. All right. As long as blue doesn't win, we're good. Ori and the Blind Forest. Oh,
[3729.38s -> 3744.20s]  okay. That's cool. I want to pick these up. How do you pick up the things on the ground?
[3751.78s -> 3755.38s]  What are you doing? I made one mistake and you're going to eliminate me twice?
[3756.18s -> 3761.58s]  What the hell? I tased you once and you're going to throw me off the ship two times?
[3764.70s -> 3786.60s]  Come on, man. Bro is holding a grudge. Yeah. Well, I still, I want you to win because I get the win
[3786.60s -> 3800.90s]  too. Oh, he hates you. He does. He hates me. I'm going to stay away from him. I'm going to,
[3800.90s -> 3804.58s]  I can stay on the other side of the map because he sees the hammerhead and he's like,
[3804.58s -> 3843.51s]  I'm going to kill that guy. Good backflip. Give me, give me. Oops. Sorry. That was kind of loud.
[3846.01s -> 3852.95s]  No, no, no, no. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. See ya. All right. I got,
[3852.95s -> 3864.60s]  I got to clutch this up right now. What are you doing? Oh my God. I freaked out. What I,
[3867.90s -> 3874.06s]  I didn't. Okay. Let me explain. Let me explain. Everyone listened for one second. I thought the
[3874.06s -> 3884.47s]  ship was two or three. I thought it was longer. No, I want to get up there and get my picture
[3884.47s -> 3894.06s]  taken. You're so bad. I thought the ship was a little bit longer. I was, that guy freaked me
[3894.06s -> 3901.22s]  out. I thought he was coming to get me. We still win. That's all right. It's a win. He looked like
[3901.22s -> 3916.89s]  a mole rat. Why did you move? I don't know. What famous animal would you add to this game? An
[3916.89s -> 3932.90s]  armadillo? It might even be in the game already. Oh, what is this one? Carry candies back. Oh,
[3932.90s -> 3942.58s]  okay. Carry candies back to base to earn points. I'm going just straight up defense. Octopus.
[3942.58s -> 3950.63s]  Octopus will be cool. Squid. Octopus. Is there a whale? Is there like a lobster or crab or
[3950.63s -> 3963.53s]  something? That'd be a great addition. Play Counter-Strike 2 in your off time. It's a great
[3963.53s -> 3973.74s]  game. It's really fun. I remember playing the original Counter-Strike 1.6. I was terrible at
[3973.74s -> 3983.29s]  it, but I played it. I tried CSGO. There's a video on my YouTube channel where I talk about
[3983.29s -> 3988.01s]  like, oh yeah, man, going to be playing a lot of CSGO. I think I played it one time and never played
[3988.01s -> 3993.00s]  it ever again. And I think there's a video of me playing it. And it's like, oh yeah, like it's a
[3993.00s -> 3999.70s]  big deal. And I just, I just, it just wasn't for me at all. People are, people are too good at that
[3999.70s -> 4012.02s]  game. Where's our base? Where do we turn this in? Oh, right here. You can't fall down that, can you?
[4012.58s -> 4039.46s]  I'm going to start just transferring. Give me that. All right. Deposit those and we'll win.
[4050.92s -> 4075.05s]  Did I help? Am I dead? Dead? Am I dead? Dead? I'm here. I'm good. Nice job. Duck. All right.
[4075.05s -> 4084.02s]  We're doing all right. No shit. I'm sorry. Make sure you bring them all back. Come on,
[4084.02s -> 4098.97s]  we got to work together. Get with that shit. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[4098.97s -> 4103.34s]  Just take it back. Take it back. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Go, go, go, go,
[4103.82s -> 4117.50s]  up, up, up, up, up. We got it. We got it. We got it. Where are you going? Where are you going?
[4117.50s -> 4121.38s]  Where are they going with that? I just stomped all over that guy's face.
[4128.58s -> 4139.00s]  Don't let him drop it. Don't let him. Close this shit. No, don't open it again. Close it. Did I
[4139.00s -> 4159.00s]  close it or did I open it? Give me this. Give me this. I'm going to drop you into the fucking
[4159.00s -> 4176.20s]  freezer. Damn it. We can hear you mashing buttons. You can hear me like gripping the controller.
[4186.82s -> 4210.65s]  Shit. This game is fun. I like it. Don't eat the controller. It's going to hurt to poop.
[4210.65s -> 4226.79s]  What about Dark and Darker? Um, not in the immediate future. What about football? What
[4226.79s -> 4237.48s]  is it? Stay away from the poison cloud and stay alive. Uh, I get it. Browser games? We'll do
[4237.48s -> 4243.43s]  browser games the next time I stream. Or maybe I'll play the Resident Evil DLC. That sounds fun
[4243.43s -> 4268.79s]  too. Resident Evil 4? I also have to finish Sorcery. He's just going to play Binding of Isaac
[4268.79s -> 4290.34s]  for four hours. Waste. All right. Stay out of the poison. I have a new strategy. It's called just
[4290.34s -> 4309.59s]  stay on the ground. It's playing dead. Nobody pays attention really. This is where I get up and
[4309.59s -> 4327.11s]  throw you. I'm going to throw you in. Oh, nevermind. God damn it. How do I get out of here? Oh shit.
[4337.78s -> 4346.92s]  All right. I had a choice. I knew that was going to blow up in half a second. I was trying to
[4346.92s -> 4350.84s]  throw it at somebody. Just, you got to try. You have to go for it. Otherwise I would have blown
[4350.84s -> 4368.78s]  right back. Yeah, but why? Okay. I was climbing up here and there were three bombs here. I climbed
[4368.78s -> 4385.18s]  up here. Boom. Blinking red. At some point you have to just go for it. Your teammate is so good.
[4385.82s -> 4394.57s]  Yeah. They're so good. In fact, that I'm on the menu too. As long as we win, I'll take the three
[4394.65s -> 4420.79s]  eggs. Whatever. Oh, I think we actually, no he's dead. Oh, it gets closer. Oh, he shot him in the
[4420.79s -> 4441.94s]  head. What the fuck? That guy, he's done that to me twice. Thank you so much. Damn it. I want those
[4441.94s -> 4463.82s]  nunchucks. Why is this guy glowing? I don't know how to fix this. How do I fix this? Oh, okay.
[4463.82s -> 4482.87s]  Give me. Hold it the right way. Oh shit. Sorry. I'm sorry. I did not mean to hit you in the head
[4482.87s -> 4500.74s]  with that, but it just happened. Second, I get a melee weapon. It's over for everybody. I'm trying
[4500.74s -> 4543.93s]  to plant this on somebody. Damn it. Hold it the right way. No. Oh, come on. Fuck. Dude, Miku has
[4543.93s -> 4549.93s]  been waiting for birthday wishes for you from a month. I said, happy birthday, Miku. You just
[4549.93s -> 4573.91s]  weren't here. I said it. Yes, I did. Oh my God. This guy's going to kill me. You can't see who
[4573.91s -> 4587.22s]  did that, right? This person has no idea I did that. I should save the coins. Do they carry over?
[4590.41s -> 4622.38s]  I imagine probably so. I'm going right for the boomerang. I need to get away from everybody.
[4630.09s -> 4644.81s]  Damn it. Watch out, please. You hit, hit. I have to get away from the guy with the frying pan.
[4648.82s -> 4652.82s]  That was a risky move, but you know what? Fuck it. I'm in the face of the fucking cinder block.
[4656.70s -> 4695.19s]  Who is dude? What? Watch out. Uh, we need some, we need some more teamwork.
[4696.23s -> 4710.66s]  Just give it to me. Don't. This is such a bad place to be. Why am I still on the ground?
[4733.75s -> 4763.56s]  I screamed a lot today. They call me. Okay. Get the brick. Did I not? I didn't. How did I not
[4763.56s -> 4797.05s]  hit you with the brick? I dropped on his head. I got him. He's not getting up for a long time.
[4797.05s -> 4814.31s]  Oh, thank goodness. We're all hurt. This guy just won't leave me alone. No. What? Wait,
[4814.31s -> 4831.72s]  what just happened? Oh, the gas was everywhere. Come on. We got to get in the picture together.
[4845.85s -> 4857.27s]  Right when the picture gets taken. Can't wait for Hylics 2. How long is Hylics 2?
[4857.27s -> 4876.42s]  Because I know Hylics 1 was four, five hours? Three, four? It's like five to 10. There's a
[4876.42s -> 4886.38s]  lot of game modes. What is wind tunnel? Eh, we'll do this one. Beat the hockey into opponent's
[4886.38s -> 4905.54s]  gate to earn points. Beat the hockey into opponent's gate. Trevor, can you do another
[4905.54s -> 4911.75s]  sponsored stream? Oh, all right. Okay. I mean, that's a request. That's a request. Somebody
[4911.75s -> 4931.54s]  just requested one. One guy, one guy moment. You know what I mean? Nobody said. Nobody said
[4931.54s -> 4948.41s]  you make me sick. Oh, settle down. Industry plant. All right. So we have to score goals.
[4948.41s -> 4964.90s]  Oh, it's this thing. It's a huge puck. We're not going to score on our own goal, right?
[4971.69s -> 4974.65s]  It's a whole, there's a whole team of gorillas. Oh, no, it's not.
[4982.62s -> 5002.44s]  Dude, I want to, I want to watch this version of hockey. Oh, I'm on your team. Give me this thing.
[5003.38s -> 5028.58s]  I got it. I got it. I'm just going to play defense. He's just holding his arm out and
[5028.58s -> 5039.42s]  has his palm on the top of my head and I am swinging while he holds me back. We just get a
[5039.42s -> 5057.42s]  goal. Okay, let's go. All right. We got to be aggressive now. Aggressive, aggressive, aggressive.
[5059.85s -> 5077.29s]  Good, good, good, good, good, good. One more. There it is. Nice job. That was the most tired
[5077.29s -> 5101.62s]  let's go ever. Let's go. This thing probably pushes it pretty far, right? I'm going to play
[5101.62s -> 5112.44s]  goalie. I actually think that's a smart use of my time right now. All right, get it out of here.
[5115.35s -> 5132.04s]  Yeah, this is offsides. You're going to get a fucking red card. Where am I? Yeah, try getting
[5132.04s -> 5154.02s]  it by me. Oh shit. Don't please. Okay. And the goalie is coming out of his goal and he's going
[5154.02s -> 5160.94s]  all the way down. We've never seen anything like this before in giant puck ice hockey.
[5167.10s -> 5193.83s]  I helped. Defense. Let me handle this. Had my shield. Oh, deflected. Parried. Oh, parried again.
[5193.83s -> 5215.72s]  Come on. You're just, I mean, you're getting parried. You guys got it. Stay forward. Face forward.
[5221.53s -> 5238.55s]  Get out of here. Oh my god. That, my head spun 360 degrees. Oh, that's sad. Look at where I was.
[5238.87s -> 5259.29s]  This game is fun. All right. You want to fight? I'll give you a fight. I blocked it with my body
[5259.29s -> 5271.61s]  and my face and my head and my brain and the concussion that I now have. I don't know. It
[5271.61s -> 5289.21s]  looks so good. I just got up from a concussion, dude. Really? Unsportsmanlike conduct. Got it.
[5289.21s -> 5313.30s]  They're dinosaurs. That's cool. If you come over here, I am going to make your life a living hell.
[5314.02s -> 5329.86s]  Nice. Tell the Oreo puke story. Okay. When I was
[5333.34s -> 5376.65s]  college, what did I just do? There's a puck. This is my chance. It's my chance. No, we can do it.
[5376.65s -> 5386.49s]  Come on. Stay in the back a little. If it flies back here, I'm going to be ready to get it.
[5386.49s -> 5421.99s]  Everybody just stay on the goal. I just have to body block. Oh, this is so embarrassing.
[5422.07s -> 5434.63s]  This is really embarrassing. It's like I took an extra five seconds to know I was still playing
[5434.63s -> 5463.56s]  the game. Oh my God. Get out of here. Oh shit. Oh shit. You stood there like a kid in the little
[5463.56s -> 5485.14s]  league. Yeah. Come on. It's right there. We won. Wasn't it a tie? Oh no, we did win.
[5485.14s -> 5508.74s]  I just want to get in front of this guy and ruin the picture. Your character looks like you.
[5509.30s -> 5533.26s]  I don't think. What do you mean? Explain. Explain. He does. Explain. It's the eyes.
[5536.25s -> 5554.92s]  You guys think my eyes are that far apart? My eyes are not that far apart. Your eyes are close
[5554.92s -> 5574.42s]  together. I think my eyes are very normal distance. We should compare. Looks like we struck
[5574.42s -> 5582.42s]  a nerve. I don't care. I don't like, I don't fucking care at all. It's just annoying. I don't
[5582.90s -> 5588.50s]  give a shit. I don't care. I don't give a fuck about that. I don't know. It's annoying to me.
[5588.50s -> 5605.38s]  I don't care though. What are you talking about? I think I'm good right here. Nice try. No,
[5605.38s -> 5615.13s]  no, you're not going to get me off it. I'll pull it this way. I don't care as long as I'm behind
[5615.13s -> 5635.85s]  the wind. Dude, everybody just stop grabbing at it. Oh, I'm going to fuck this up so bad.
[5636.73s -> 5663.64s]  Oh, actually not bad. Oh, well, sacrifice yourself. Blue team wins, right? You need to
[5663.64s -> 5678.49s]  do a bunch of wind compensation there. Is somebody else alive? No. Dude, I'm on your team.
[5683.56s -> 5693.69s]  Get up. We've got to pull, all right, we have to pull a lever. Somebody, we're all going to go,
[5693.69s -> 5717.56s]  we're all going to die. That's what I want. I want chaos. Hit him instead. Oh fuck. All right,
[5717.56s -> 5741.14s]  that's really strong. Yeah, go the long way. Everybody comes over to me. You're getting shot.
[5748.76s -> 5772.28s]  Oh fuck. I need to live too. Oh shit. No. Oh shit. It's two v one. This is not good. Oh,
[5786.02s -> 5796.20s]  oh, I got him. Can you not climb this? What's going on here? Why are you not doing this?
[5798.44s -> 5820.98s]  Climb up this. Why can't I? Why couldn't I climb? He had to go around. It was convex. Oh shit.
[5821.70s -> 5843.18s]  Stick out by my guys up there. Take somebody off from red because they're going to sacrifice
[5843.18s -> 5858.06s]  themselves. This is very, very low. Is he going to get blown off? What's going on with this guy?
[5858.06s -> 5888.74s]  Trying to get the head butt in. All right, the goal is to stay all the way to the left.
[5888.74s -> 5913.67s]  Everyone's going to just, as we need stuff up now, hold on. Don't let go. Don't let go. Don't
[5913.67s -> 5937.78s]  let go. I'm holding the thing down. At least the wind's not here. Fine, fine, fine. Take that one.
[5937.78s -> 5955.22s]  I don't care. We can all have one. Let me know. This is how we survive. What the fuck? I was
[5955.22s -> 5974.39s]  what? What was that? Well, I got annihilated. What was that all about? No, don't. No, don't. Please.
[5992.39s -> 6027.27s]  I got it. Don't worry. All right. Good luck. All right. Lower profile. And him. Oh man,
[6027.27s -> 6039.37s]  that was pretty good. That's fine, I don't care. Just stuff over here. Oh, don't ever jump here.
[6039.37s -> 6065.48s]  Ever. Oh my. God damn it. Bring back grandpa. Hey, it's me. Grandpa. Okay, bye. Hey, oh,
[6065.48s -> 6082.10s]  Grant, you just missed him. You didn't even get a crown. I got a crown my first game,
[6082.10s -> 6096.14s]  and the second game, and the third game. Are you playing against bots? No, it's a streamer
[6096.30s -> 6104.92s]  zone. I just saw it was a thing I could click, and I said, if they have it, something to enable,
[6105.48s -> 6109.24s]  there's a reason why they want you to enable it. That's my philosophy on the whole thing.
[6110.31s -> 6147.56s]  Oh, everybody loves this one. These are bots. I need to get some new skins. You should roll for
[6147.56s -> 6159.16s]  10 skins. You have to get a high enough MMR to matchmake. Oh, is that for real? I kind of feel
[6159.40s -> 6207.86s]  like I've been talking shit this whole time. Nice try. Oh, double tap. Oh, triple. No, you don't.
[6207.86s -> 6221.59s]  It's just 2v2. We got it. Come on, duck. You just pushed me off. You dope. You dope. You jumped off.
[6221.59s -> 6229.08s]  Well, I jumped, but then he gave me the extra momentum to fly off. I would have landed perfectly
[6229.08s -> 6257.53s]  fine. I'm perfectly safe. Okay, come on. Does this thing hurt, or is it just bounce? Yeah,
[6257.53s -> 6271.74s]  I think it's just a bouncer. Swing at him. Why am I not swinging it anymore?
[6283.19s -> 6303.35s]  Oh, that's my friend. Sorry. No. Oh, shit. That hurt. I'm using an inflatable toy.
[6304.31s -> 6326.89s]  Good start. I tried to save him. Don't even think about it. Was that a hat? Oh, it's a banana.
[6345.34s -> 6363.08s]  Get that bomb away from me. Oh my god. I have the weapon, and I'm scared. No, give me back. Give
[6363.08s -> 6392.49s]  me the weapon back. Yeah. I'm just not capable of doing that advanced technique, and I just tried.
[6392.49s -> 6398.62s]  I went for the advanced technique. It was just immediately run, jump, kick, and it was a problem.
[6408.41s -> 6439.85s]  Why is Yoshi driving? I don't know. Yoshi, you can do it. I know you can. You have super power.
[6443.75s -> 6453.56s]  Don't do the dive jump. It's bad. Not a good idea right now. Good. Finish it off. Finish it.
[6453.56s -> 6484.55s]  Good finish. Nice work. God damn it. Don't shoot me. Okay, I'm good. Get away from me.
[6485.43s -> 6490.65s]  Oh, he's got me with the plunger. No, I'm plunged right now.
[6498.84s -> 6518.14s]  Where is it? What the fuck was that? What was I doing? The fact that he was pulling his arms
[6518.22s -> 6528.90s]  behind his back trying to... Oh, that was cartoonish. That was fucking wedged.
[6529.62s -> 6538.38s]  Jeez. Okay, as long as green doesn't win, we're good. I don't even know who... I don't know who won.
[6538.38s -> 6556.22s]  They both fell off at the same time. That was fun. All right, now I'm gonna get some skins.
[6556.22s -> 6584.07s]  I'm like whispering a secret to him. Where'd they get... That's a pumpkin head. That's kind of cool.
[6584.07s -> 6597.29s]  All right, let me go back and do some... Let's see. 1,500 cookies and some money. I got 200 bucks.
[6598.86s -> 6605.05s]  All right, what can I do? This one's 22,000. 12,000. This is what people are spending their
[6605.05s -> 6636.44s]  money on, I guess. Okay, yeah, that's cool. I like blue. Should I do it with money? Why not, right?
[6636.44s -> 6652.76s]  And I got blue. I wanted blue and now I have blue blue. Nice. Do I need to have blue to do blue blue?
[6653.48s -> 6669.62s]  You should roll for 10. Do you have to buy the money? No, okay. Let's do it. I'm gonna do one
[6669.62s -> 6676.06s]  more and then I'm gonna go take a quick break and come back and do this one. You get money on level
[6676.06s -> 6708.18s]  ups, yeah. Is he tired already? No, I'm lounging. Show the beanbag chair. Uh, you will see it
[6708.18s -> 6722.52s]  eventually. This is the one that we have not seen. You should wear a giant yellow raincoat on stream.
[6722.52s -> 6756.01s]  Intriguing. Cool. All right, Lulu. And get a big yellow hat and adopt a monkey. What did the man
[6756.01s -> 6767.98s]  in the yellow hat do for a living? What did he do? He's an archaeologist. He was a researcher.
[6767.98s -> 6780.23s]  He was a zookeeper. I was like, what a fit that is. A long brimmed yellow hat and just a yellow
[6780.95s -> 6793.85s]  jacket, yellow pants. That is an awesome look. Then you showed up to work and your boss was in the
[6794.33s -> 6805.90s]  the man, the curious George dad fit. He'd be like, holy shit, I really hate to do this. I'm really
[6805.90s -> 6812.55s]  sorry. What just happened? What just happened to my head? What did he just do? Did I just hit my
[6812.55s -> 6833.32s]  head on his head? What just happened? Yes, come on. Oh, I would say I deserved it, but it's a free
[6833.32s -> 6848.89s]  for, no it's not. What hit me? The gorilla is popular. Look at this. I kind of want the gorilla
[6848.89s -> 6870.18s]  now. I feel like my gaming skill would increase by at least 25% if I was the gorilla. Got him on
[6870.18s -> 6898.65s]  the backswing. Oh, my team, I'm on green. Okay. Hi, I want you to win. You can do it. Did I help?
[6898.65s -> 6925.93s]  I'm not sure. You can do it. Let them fight each other. Ooh, big punch. Almost got it. Watch out
[6925.93s -> 6934.23s]  behind you though. I'm not in a discord with anybody, but they can't hear me. Seems to lose, right?
[6935.03s -> 6979.00s]  Did we win? Okay, good. I want to stick this on somebody. Come here. Got you. Okay, let go. Shit.
[6989.66s -> 7003.93s]  Okay, come here. I threw him far too. Good. I punched him in the face. In your arms. Nice work.
[7004.01s -> 7054.50s]  Come on, get up. Dude, you overshoot it every time. Fuck you. Oh, that's bad. Actually kind of good. Come
[7054.50s -> 7085.26s]  on. Shoot. All right, two gorillas. One with a nunchuck. Who wins? He just knocked himself out
[7085.26s -> 7105.35s]  with a nunchuck. That'd be so funny if he lost. Pretty even. You're AFK. I'm going to help you here.
[7105.35s -> 7125.27s]  See? I didn't kill you. You're AFK. Remember that for when you try to get me. How is it going through
[7125.27s -> 7148.17s]  the gap between their two heads? That's what I want to know. Oh, don't even think about it. Shit.
[7153.10s -> 7159.78s]  The poor cat is over there, still lying down. I need to rescue the cat. I'm rescuing the cat.
[7160.42s -> 7173.72s]  I think it's too late. Oh, come on. The cat. The cat's going down. Cat's going down.
[7174.76s -> 7191.42s]  Iceberg melting. Oh, I feel bad. That was my fault. I'm going to get up first and we're going to win.
[7197.29s -> 7208.06s]  Get. Come on. What? Oh, give me a break. I was grabbing onto the ledge and then my left arm
[7208.06s -> 7214.30s]  grabbed onto his head and then pushed his head down. I just saw blood and I just had to just
[7214.30s -> 7227.05s]  continue. No. Why didn't you climb up? Whatever. Oh, this is going to be fun. Oh, I was going to
[7227.05s -> 7240.46s]  try to have like 10 plungers in his head. I'm staying. No. I want to stay over here with the cat.
[7241.10s -> 7304.57s]  Oh, shit. This is big for me. No. Excuse me. Get me the fuck away from that. Wait. You idiot.
[7304.57s -> 7313.74s]  The two red team is still here. All right. I'm going to hang out for a second.
[7325.69s -> 7349.00s]  Get away from me. I don't know what to do. Oh, conductivity. I forgot about conductivity.
[7349.08s -> 7369.38s]  Sorry, I'm still alive. Run. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why are you having so much trouble
[7369.38s -> 7378.22s]  getting up? Come on, dude. Get up. Do it. Get up. Why is he not getting up? Why is he not getting
[7378.22s -> 7390.36s]  up? Did I win? No stamina. Oh, I think we still won. All right. One more. This might be a win
[7390.36s -> 7417.88s]  right here. I just knocked somebody out with my body weight. Jesus. What happened? What happened?
[7427.14s -> 7445.62s]  Get out of here. Come on. Who wants to fuck around? Who wants to fuck around? Get that thing
[7445.62s -> 7455.93s]  away from me. This is it. This is a win right here. If I get it, if I get it. I got it. I got
[7455.93s -> 7479.83s]  it. I got it. This is a win. This is a guaranteed win. I thought everybody was dead. I thought
[7479.83s -> 7486.74s]  everybody was dead, but they were just on a different part of the map. That dude's probably
[7486.74s -> 7492.70s]  pissed. That's the first time that person's got that power up and they get hit with a coin.
[7502.10s -> 7509.00s]  Uh, okay. We're still in it as long as, uh, yeah, there's no green. Unfortunately,
[7512.65s -> 7527.21s]  yellow can win. That's fine. Good. Blue winning here would be huge. So we're going to try to
[7527.77s -> 7539.69s]  put our thumb on the scale here. Nice job. You're green. Yeah. I don't want yellow to win.
[7542.70s -> 7546.78s]  Okay. Oh, blue had one win too. Shit. All right. This is, this is it. This is the one here. Let
[7546.78s -> 7559.30s]  me try as hard as I can. One, two, three, go. Yup. Wow. Oh, please tell me I eliminated five
[7559.30s -> 7583.69s]  people. We don't want blue to win. Blue or yellow has to lose. Where's my teammate? Do I have a
[7583.69s -> 7610.63s]  teammate? No, I need that pen. Oh my God. It hit me right in the face. It hit me right in the face.
[7610.63s -> 7618.54s]  That's so frustrating. You can do it. I know you can get up there. I'll be careful though.
[7619.58s -> 7658.54s]  But, but, but, but get off me. Get off me. What did I just do? No, I had an opportunity,
[7658.54s -> 7681.90s]  but I missed it. Holy shit. Whoever did that, you just saved everything. Shit. No, right to him.
[7683.13s -> 7690.62s]  Don't. Oh my God. Why is he so super powered? Why does this guy have super powers? How do you get,
[7690.62s -> 7701.61s]  how do you get the super power? You have to eat a biscuit or a drink. Oh,
[7707.08s -> 7715.93s]  damn it. Did I even have a teammate? I feel like I didn't have a teammate that whole time.
[7727.61s -> 7742.89s]  There's a whole gorillas. You killed him with the bomb. Oh, that seems to be a theme.
[7743.77s -> 7748.50s]  Where's my teammate? What happened? Oh, you killed him in the first five seconds. Oh, right.
[7748.50s -> 7757.75s]  Makes sense. Right. Sure. He was AFK the whole time. I think we did pretty good for AFK teammate.
[7763.45s -> 7790.86s]  Can we bully Jerma? No, but you lighten up a little bit. Bullies you. Stop. It's not his
[7790.86s -> 7796.50s]  birthday anymore. We don't have to be nice to him. It's my birthday month. Hey, if Grimace gets to do
[7796.50s -> 7839.75s]  that, I do too. You gotta follow the same rules. Where's your weird milkshake? All right. This is
[7839.75s -> 7866.95s]  a goofy one. Is it lit? Oh, that's not good. Saved by the bomb. What do I do with it? There was no
[7866.95s -> 7892.65s]  way to put it. All right. Good job, blue team. No, it's my bomb. Oh, I got him. I got him. He
[7892.65s -> 7909.18s]  bailed on the bomb and it was the mistake. He bailed on the bomb. What the fuck? I'm all right.
[7909.18s -> 7937.27s]  I got a hand on the, uh, on it. Oh, this is one of those laughing games. You know what I mean?
[7937.27s -> 7947.21s]  I kind of threw pretty hard right there. I'm not gonna lie. That was really dumb.
[7947.93s -> 7960.76s]  I threw completely. I actually just, I just threw. Where's my teammate? Oh, there you go. Well,
[7961.40s -> 7980.31s]  we'll get him next time. Right in the head. Oh, you're gonna get kicked from the clan for that
[7980.31s -> 8000.94s]  one. That's so rough when it does that. I get so impatient here because I just want to throw
[8000.94s -> 8028.02s]  rocks at him. I don't want to. The bomb is awesome, but anybody's game. Ouch. That was a
[8028.02s -> 8039.85s]  really good throw too. Oh, unfortunate. That was a great throw. Perfect placement. All right. Let
[8039.85s -> 8057.13s]  me see if I can drop bomb. Got it. I just threw it right there. Decent placement. Lots of damage
[8057.13s -> 8080.74s]  on blue. We don't want blue to win. No. Oh, that's too bad. That's if you can get this thing,
[8080.74s -> 8093.38s]  it's game over. No, I need to buy the handle. No, no, nobody can use it. Shit. Come on.
[8094.34s -> 8109.72s]  Your teammate's AFK, is he? Not like it really matters that much. You have five feet of space
[8109.72s -> 8126.55s]  next to you. People just ramming into each other anyways. Floating dead in the river right now.
[8128.79s -> 8145.22s]  Nobody's won yet. We're doing all right. That, I didn't even see that. Am I the only one that
[8145.22s -> 8155.21s]  died from that? I'm the only person that died. Okay. Well, blue, I got it. This has got to be
[8155.21s -> 8162.95s]  a good bomb here. Right there. Perfect. Oh, that's going to be great. Watch this.
[8164.07s -> 8173.77s]  Oh, I thought they were going to get launched over to it. Blue cannot win. Come on, cat. You got it.
[8173.77s -> 8207.34s]  Nice throw. There we go. Don't be. Okay. You guys can do that all you want. Whoa. Wow.
[8207.50s -> 8235.46s]  What happened to that guy? Hey, we did it. He hit himself. Oh, okay. Wait, I got to drink that,
[8235.46s -> 8251.78s]  right? I plunged him. Watch out for that bomb. It's going to eliminate every single person.
[8251.78s -> 8266.55s]  This is going to be awesome. Nobody wants to pick it up. Dude, really? Really? Everyone's like
[8266.55s -> 8270.47s]  running around the bomb. No, I would have picked it up. I would have been the first person to pick
[8270.47s -> 8308.02s]  it up. Oh, red one. I need to win another one. Oh, game's addicting. Damn it. Okay. One more.
[8308.02s -> 8315.35s]  And then I'm going to actually go to the bathroom. Get blue death feigning beetles?
[8316.84s -> 8325.16s]  No, we want them. We just want to be in a position where we can take care of them.
[8325.80s -> 8335.59s]  It's all like the traveling, lots of stuff going on. I would say probably like in the,
[8335.59s -> 8341.22s]  in the new year, we'll probably get them. I want to make sure we can really,
[8341.22s -> 8347.53s]  like truly pay attention to them. Everything. Oh, what is this? I've never seen this one.
[8347.53s -> 8369.51s]  Oh, let's play the new one. They're very easy to take care of. That's what we have heard. Hey,
[8369.51s -> 8381.05s]  they love grapes, right? I love grapes. It was just meant to be. Did you get a pet lobster?
[8383.64s -> 8393.05s]  That's cool. I love fish. I love aquatic life. I love marine life, but I don't, taking care of
[8393.05s -> 8399.66s]  aquatic life. There's a lot of maintenance, like cleaning the tank and making sure that the
[8399.66s -> 8410.82s]  levels are good, right? Like you can't just like, oh, there's my lobster. I mean, I've heard it's
[8410.82s -> 8419.16s]  very fulfilling and it's really cool to have like a bunch of fish in a fish tank or lobsters or
[8419.16s -> 8447.24s]  crabs or whatever people do. I'm going to score my first goal ever. Hey, why are you so mean to me?
[8451.00s -> 8493.19s]  That's the inside of that. How are you that good to be able to do that? Also the play is probably
[8493.19s -> 8517.00s]  just a standstill while everybody just runs into each other. There you go. Nice. Are you excited
[8517.00s -> 8523.03s]  for the FNAF movie? Yeah, I'll watch that one on times four speed instead of times six speed.
[8523.75s -> 8545.18s]  So yeah, I mean, I'm very, I'm going to tell him very excited for it. What's Saw X? Yeah, I don't,
[8545.18s -> 8561.43s]  I want to see Saw X, but I don't want to go to the theater to see Saw X. Although they're making
[8561.43s -> 8573.64s]  this one a big deal. This one's a big deal. And we all know how much of a fan I am of the
[8573.64s -> 8592.12s]  Saw movies. Although I can't say I remember what happened between five and 10. Oh my God. I, wow.
[8592.76s -> 8604.90s]  I jumped in the air and he hit me right in the chin. Come on, come on. Go, go, go, go, go. It's
[8604.90s -> 8629.03s]  right there. Stop him from doing this. How did we not stop him from doing that? Marathon them.
[8639.90s -> 8645.34s]  I still do want to do that thing I talked about. It might just, it might just be a video. I think
[8645.34s -> 8659.88s]  it's funnier as a video. Yeah. So watch along. Wait, did I, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's
[8659.88s -> 8664.20s]  happened? I forgot what, I forgot what team I was on. Am I going, is this correct? Is this bad?
[8685.86s -> 8703.85s]  That got everybody. That wiped out the whole crew. Oh my. This has been a big talking stream,
[8703.85s -> 8712.58s]  more than a gaming stream. It can be both. But a game like this is pretty much just kind of goofy
[8712.58s -> 8733.13s]  and fun to sit here and play it. Pulling his hair. Oh shit. I forgot I was going to go. All
[8733.13s -> 8740.20s]  right. One more. How's the mystery video? Well, there are two videos that I want to do. The one
[8740.20s -> 8748.94s]  I was just talking about. And then this one, the mystery one. I'm only making the mystery video
[8748.94s -> 8755.86s]  for me. It's not for anybody else. So when you see this, just, it was not, I didn't make it for
[8755.86s -> 8774.33s]  anybody else, but it could get 10 views and I wouldn't even care. Everyone wants to play them.
[8774.33s -> 8783.13s]  I'm bad at these ones. I don't like these ones. Okay. I won't watch it. That's all right. It
[8783.13s -> 8788.71s]  actually is fine because the video is not going to be any good. This video is going to overstay its
[8788.71s -> 8795.78s]  welcome in the first 30 seconds. And it's going to be like a seven minute video or more. It could
[8795.78s -> 8819.32s]  be longer. I don't know. I am actually going to play goalie this time. All right. Good, good,
[8819.32s -> 8831.51s]  good. Go. Nice. Somebody else is playing goalie. Watch this. I'm going to go fuck this guy up.
[8836.71s -> 8859.83s]  Yeah. I'm talking to you. What the fuck? I see. I'm distracting him. This is bad for him.
[8860.47s -> 8872.23s]  All right. All right. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. All right. All right. I'm done.
[8872.95s -> 8890.01s]  I'm a good spot right here. Give me a spot right now. Watch this. I got a line right to the goal.
[8890.01s -> 8906.50s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Here we go. Three, two, one. Dude, get it out of here.
[8907.06s -> 8950.73s]  Okay. We're good. What'd you say? Get over there. Oh, I get credit for that one. I do.
[8950.73s -> 8968.07s]  I get credit for that one. Perfect bounce. I like that little guy. He's funny. The shark. Yeah.
[8968.07s -> 8994.36s]  I'm going to be the last one to get up. I would have been there, but I was so late to get up. Hey,
[8994.36s -> 9002.06s]  good night, Jerma. You should have played fall guys instead. I don't want to play fall guys.
[9002.06s -> 9037.94s]  I want to play party animals. I'm getting in the goal. This is dangerous. Imagine seeing a goalie
[9037.94s -> 9053.90s]  come out and do that. The other team scores on their goal. Oh, he's not on the goal. He's not
[9054.70s -> 9068.42s]  on the goal. Uh-oh. Not on the goal. Hey, hey, hey, bro, bro. Get your head in the game.
[9068.42s -> 9090.62s]  Who else wasn't in the goal? Yeah, but I belly to belly suplex that guy. It's worth something.
[9101.24s -> 9120.86s]  That cat's eyes. Holy shit. That cat. That cat like hot boxed his room for an hour. All right.
[9120.86s -> 9129.26s]  I'll be right back. Just going to get another, get some water. Use the bathroom. Back in two
[9129.26s -> 9370.62s]  minutes. Three minutes. I am back. I want to do something. Check this out. Ready? Turn the game
[9370.62s -> 9391.32s]  down. Have you guys ever done this before? The brainstorm or green needle viral video? Somebody
[9391.32s -> 9408.94s]  have. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no. It's really, it's weird. Okay. So there's this toy that when you
[9408.94s -> 9418.92s]  press a button on it, it plays an audio file and the audio file that it plays, it goes brainstorm,
[9418.92s -> 9426.73s]  brainstorm, but you can make your brain. You can make you, you can make yourself hear something
[9426.73s -> 9431.58s]  else. Let's do the experiment. It's been like five years. Hey, I just found it. So whatever.
[9435.42s -> 9453.69s]  I'm 40 and I'm retired. Okay. We find things a little later. I want to do it, uh, brainstorm
[9453.69s -> 9464.07s]  because sometimes it'll say both at the same time and it's freaky. All right, here we go. Ready?
[9464.07s -> 9493.50s]  What do you hear? Do you hear brainstorm or do you hear green needle? Brainstorm.
[9497.22s -> 9515.08s]  Brainstorm. Right? Brainstorm. Okay. Green needle. Green needle. Green needle. Brainstorm.
[9519.50s -> 9524.62s]  Who the fuck is hearing green needle? It's going to happen. You know, that image of,
[9524.62s -> 9528.94s]  I think it's like a spinning ballerina that if you watch it long enough, it spins the other
[9528.94s -> 9545.40s]  way. It's like that. Just give it a second. Green needle. Buzzfeed Andy. Green needle.
[9549.40s -> 9567.91s]  Isn't that cool? Isn't that interesting? Isn't that cool? I heard radio static. Huh? Getting
[9567.91s -> 9577.02s]  real 78 year old grandmothers showing something on the computer vibes. Do Yanny and, oh yeah,
[9577.02s -> 9592.79s]  this one too. Let's try this one. All right. What do you hear on this one? What do you hear?
[9592.95s -> 9603.21s]  Mary. Laurel. Mary. Laurel. Mary. Mary. It's hard for me to get it to do the other one.
[9604.60s -> 9607.56s]  Mary. Mary. Cause it goes like,
[9616.10s -> 9618.18s]  I can't get it to say, I can't get it to say Yanny.
[9619.21s -> 9630.66s]  Mary. Yanny. No, I can't get it to do Yanny now. Mary. Mary. Shit. Mary. It's Laurel only.
[9630.98s -> 9642.34s]  Mary. Say, say. Mary. Yanny. Mary. Shit. Mary. Mary. Okay. So the parts, the, the kind of the,
[9642.34s -> 9655.10s]  the like the vibrato of the, the voice, it's like, it goes like Yanny. Yanny. But I can't get
[9655.10s -> 9672.25s]  him to do it now. Mary. Mary. Shit. Mary. Mary. Mary. Damn it. Mary. Mary. Yeah. Sometimes it
[9672.25s -> 9690.87s]  goes Laurel. Yanny. Yanny. Mary. I can't get him to do it now. All right. What do you, uh,
[9690.87s -> 9699.54s]  there's a couple more interesting ones too. Mary. I can't get them to do it. Mary. I'm
[9699.54s -> 9708.46s]  gonna try it one more time. Yanny. Say it. Mary. Mary. Mary. There's a couple more cool ones.
[9710.78s -> 9722.68s]  Let's try this one. All right. Do you hear this one? This one tripped me up big time. Do you hear
[9723.40s -> 9730.54s]  a burp or a fart? Which one? It's, it's hard for me to find, to decipher it. What do you guys hear?
[9730.54s -> 9761.66s]  What'd you hear? See, I can't get it to burp now. No, still. What are you guys hearing? You hear
[9761.66s -> 9769.22s]  both? Let me try it one more time. So I'm saying if you slow them down, you can hear different
[9769.22s -> 9790.97s]  things. Really? Hey, I, uh, like I'm, I'm hearing Laurel. That's interesting. I hear brainstorm
[9796.12s -> 9802.94s]  minus 3 million. Well, unfortunately you can't take that many points away. There's only a hundred
[9802.94s -> 9815.30s]  points. So I still get an F. You could have said you minus 50 points and I still get an F. Dude,
[9815.30s -> 9837.24s]  you're embarrassing me. All right, let's keep playing this one. Yanny. Yanny. Yanny. Okay.
[9837.24s -> 9840.68s]  If you take what I just did and mess with it, can you make it say Laurel? That's what I'm,
[9840.68s -> 9862.42s]  that's my question. Is it going to haunt me in my sleep? Um, just like,
[9863.70s -> 9878.01s]  like a couple of blueberries. It'd be all right. All righty. Let's do it. Did I get any new stuff?
[9878.57s -> 9901.06s]  Did I get any new things? Refreshes in three days. Oh, is it a burp or a fart? It's so funny.
[9901.78s -> 9930.36s]  Kind of with the cat. I'm buying the cat. Uh, hold on. I need to, this is, we're not,
[9930.36s -> 9937.00s]  we're not going anywhere. Somebody said this sounds like the DVD menu for the mask.
[9938.28s -> 9950.50s]  And we need, is it available to see if that's the, hold on a second. Oh, we, we stall a lot here.
[9950.50s -> 9962.26s]  Sorry. I'm curious. The mask DVD menu. It's right. It is here. All right. So this is the,
[9962.26s -> 9984.90s]  this is the mask DVD menu song. Okay. He's like spinning around. Okay. This is not even close.
[9990.94s -> 10003.38s]  Wait, they were thinking Austin powers. Oh, were they thinking Austin powers?
[10003.38s -> 10007.38s]  Oh, we have to, we have to ban that guy. Yeah. You gotta get, you gotta ban for at
[10007.38s -> 10010.81s]  least a couple of days. I mean, I stream like once a week now, but like, you know,
[10010.81s -> 10021.37s]  you're banned for a day. Austin. Yeah. This is just, this is kind of scary.
[10022.09s -> 10046.76s]  Austin powers DVD menu. Okay. I mean, not, I mean, not really. This is wrong too. What
[10046.76s -> 10070.92s]  does it sound like? No, not, not really. Well, wait a minute. Hold on. Wait. Unban that person.
[10070.92s -> 10085.96s]  Unban that person. And I'll tell you why this is the mask, the animated series intro.
[10086.52s -> 10089.82s]  This is what they thought of.
[10109.51s -> 10113.35s]  Wow.
[10117.98s -> 10119.42s]  Okay. Hold on.
[10122.71s -> 10136.12s]  Yeah. I tried to save you. It's, it's the same genre of music. There's two or three of the same
[10136.12s -> 10150.42s]  instruments. What about, hold on. No, I can't. I'm sorry. I can't save you, but you know,
[10150.42s -> 10159.19s]  what's cool though. I, it could be, it really could be, this could be the mask DVD menu.
[10159.19s -> 10163.85s]  You could have convinced everybody. In fact, I, it should be all right. What's going on? Oh,
[10163.85s -> 10183.02s]  I'm in an activity. Change outfit. Ah, wait. Surprise egg. Do I have enough? No. All right.
[10183.02s -> 10205.69s]  Let's play. Olive garden music. I remember that. That was great. That was a really fun night.
[10214.62s -> 10236.74s]  Jackbox. It could be jackbox. All right. I want to play this one. No, no one wants to play the
[10236.74s -> 10256.02s]  safe back to base to earn points. All right, let's go. So to grab onto it. Have you ever
[10256.02s -> 10265.56s]  done a jackbox stream? Oh yeah. Lots of times. Lots of times. Oh, let's see if my mouse is
[10265.56s -> 10277.46s]  moving. Okay. It's been a very long time. I think the reason why I don't do jackbox streams anymore
[10277.46s -> 10285.91s]  is because, uh, all the answers. Oh, okay. Everybody. So what do you think is the answer?
[10286.71s -> 10294.23s]  Is it German? Nine, eight, five. Jerma sucks. Jerma pooped his pants or Jerma sucks.
[10294.87s -> 10303.93s]  Which one of those is it? I was just like, well, these are all kind of the same answer.
[10304.01s -> 10314.18s]  Aren't they somehow? Who am I holding onto? I'm sorry. I apologize. Can I apologize?
[10314.90s -> 10347.59s]  I apologize to that person. Hey. All right. I've, I've had you in chokehold. I don't know who has
[10347.59s -> 10356.06s]  who here. He's stuffing me into a locker. I can't get out of here. What the hell?
[10357.02s -> 10411.35s]  Get off me. Just start bite, bite his neck. Bite him. Not right here. Shit. Yeah. Got him.
[10411.99s -> 10429.08s]  Let's make this way easier for us. Uh, I have, I don't know what, how this one works. This thing
[10429.08s -> 10437.27s]  floats around and we have to like put it over here. We got it. All right. Press the button.
[10438.07s -> 10484.57s]  I think we got it. Yeah, we do. There we go. We need to get the actual thing. Oh,
[10484.57s -> 10489.96s]  everyone's holding onto it. All right. Where we need to bring it. Where? I don't really know
[10489.96s -> 10512.57s]  what's happening, but we're having fun. We just got it again. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got
[10512.57s -> 10527.80s]  it. I got it. I got it right there. Right there. No. Knock it up. The first victory in an hour
[10527.80s -> 10567.66s]  and a half. That was a really bad picture. It's beautiful. Is it? It's September 27th already.
[10572.50s -> 10589.53s]  I blinked and we went from May to September. Icebreaker is a lot of fun. It's probably one
[10589.53s -> 10616.86s]  of the best maps. Retirement does too. I'm very active. I have 0.99. I wanna do that. When's the
[10616.86s -> 10620.89s]  update? Isn't there a big update coming really soon? Because I'll definitely play it when the
[10620.89s -> 10643.32s]  update comes out. Somewhere in October, right? Yes, I did try to punch my teammate and yes,
[10643.32s -> 10654.90s]  I'm sorry about it. Okay, okay, okay. You heard me. I went Super Saiyan. Am I actually gonna fall
[10654.90s -> 10671.40s]  down here at Super Saiyan? I'm gonna ruin this for everybody. This is gonna be great. Let's do this.
[10680.78s -> 10688.04s]  That should count for a win for me. I should get points for that. I should get every point for that
[10688.04s -> 10708.55s]  one. Oh, that was great. I'm so sorry, but you definitely lost. Why are we all on one of them?
[10709.11s -> 10711.75s]  There's more than one. Oh boy, that's not good.
[10731.43s -> 10740.94s]  Come on, what the hell? It's like he did that for dramatic effect. All right, let's see.
[10745.51s -> 10754.74s]  Yeah, see you later. I'm gonna put it right in the middle. Oh, that's bad for you. That whatever
[10754.74s -> 10773.10s]  the pig guy. The wind actually helped. You're terrible at this game. I know you are, but what
[10773.10s -> 10792.17s]  am I? The pig is on my team. For some reason, I always just think I'm on green team. Just to
[10792.17s -> 10829.02s]  be green. It's like, yeah, green versus red. I'm always on green team. That bunny is pissed
[10829.02s -> 10842.01s]  because of what I did last. You can hear the button pressing. Somebody turn it on. I got you.
[10843.34s -> 10882.90s]  Don't let go. I'm still here. I'll stay over here. Fuck all of you. Hey, hey, you're weighing
[10882.90s -> 10888.38s]  it down. He's weighing it down. He just weighed it down. He sat on top of the N64 cartridge and
[10888.38s -> 10902.38s]  just went right in. All right, I gotta make something happen here. I'm just like hitting
[10902.38s -> 10949.91s]  nothing. Oh, fuck. Oh, there's another one. Get up. Try to get away from the bomb. Headbutt with
[10949.91s -> 10961.42s]  that glorious head of yours. I'm gonna wait for the win. Actually, you know what? Oh, never mind.
[10961.50s -> 10982.55s]  Yellow team is the team to beat. Oh, he's gonna slurp down there. Yep. Oh, he didn't even know.
[10982.55s -> 11005.66s]  He didn't even know. I have to hold on to my friend. Oh, shit. Big move right there. Okay,
[11005.66s -> 11016.58s]  we win. We win. We win. We win. We win. We win. We win. No! I just hit him in the head with that.
[11019.46s -> 11034.18s]  I'm so sorry. Are you still alive? You can do it, man. I know you can. You can do it.
[11039.37s -> 11060.89s]  Where is he? Where is he? Where was he that whole time? My control is in my lap right now.
[11065.06s -> 11077.82s]  Whatever. Good luck, everybody. Oh, that's not good for the person. No, that's my friend,
[11077.82s -> 11101.88s]  but I gave him a bomb and he's gonna utilize it. Nice throw. All right, I have confidence in the
[11101.88s -> 11117.98s]  dog. You got this. Nice job. Stay alive. I'm gonna wait for a bomb. My team is green.
[11118.62s -> 11154.02s]  Unless they're... I might wait for the last one. Nah, let's do it now. You're okay.
[11159.42s -> 11189.90s]  Jess gets his head electrocuted. That's not cool. That's not cool. He's gone. See, to me,
[11189.90s -> 11194.76s]  you pick the bomb up when it's 2v2 and you just run at the other guy. You drop it and turn around
[11194.76s -> 11219.30s]  last second jump. Oh, you're both going down. You gotta get something up. Oh, I don't... Who was it?
[11219.86s -> 11267.54s]  Okay, good. Is the game fun? Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's really fun. Oh, this cat. Can I pull the cat
[11267.54s -> 11308.55s]  through? Okay. Big moves. Big moves. Got two of us here. Clawing under his head. No, we're all
[11308.55s -> 11320.76s]  going. Oh, and that one guy that's stuck right there. That's so annoying. Oh, we should have
[11320.76s -> 11336.14s]  spread out. That was my fault. I should have went the other way. That's the best one of the whole
[11336.14s -> 11361.37s]  night. It's a really good one. How do I add it? I want it. It's a great one. Do you think there'll
[11361.37s -> 11380.49s]  ever be one of these where everyone just behaves? Just stands in line? I'd like to see that. Do you
[11380.49s -> 11392.36s]  do your own laundry or do you have a butler? I have six butlers. One for the left arm,
[11392.36s -> 11399.37s]  one for the right arm, one for my head through, and one to feed me while I'm doing it. The other
[11399.37s -> 11407.14s]  two tie my shoes. And then the other one reads me the daily briefing of the day that I need to hear.
[11407.86s -> 11422.92s]  Number seven brushes my teeth. Number eight has already... I don't know. Number eight can just do
[11422.92s -> 11450.44s]  whatever he wants. They asked you if you did your own laundry. Oh, uh, yes. Screw that. I'm going
[11450.44s -> 11461.70s]  over here. Why fight when you can guarantee you'll be in the top four if you just smoker?
[11468.62s -> 11493.13s]  Oh my god. That was not... I just laid this person out so hard. It's like off the top rope. Excuse
[11493.13s -> 11510.81s]  me. Why did we both just do that? That was very odd. I'm not coming up here yet. You can stay up
[11510.81s -> 11526.79s]  there and taunt all you want. Look at these clowns over here. Okay, good. Very good. That's exactly
[11526.79s -> 11540.92s]  what I was wanting to see. I'm just gonna hold on. I'm just gonna hold on to this pole. Am I
[11540.92s -> 11557.99s]  still holding on to it? Somebody saved my life. This is like... I had quite a few cocktails. I'm
[11557.99s -> 11574.84s]  just gonna lie in here. I am the king of the mountain. I think I won. I did, right? Yeah.
[11575.40s -> 11608.76s]  They've been in the water for way longer than I have. Okay, I was gonna say, geez. Oh, it worked.
[11608.76s -> 11649.19s]  It worked, but I got hurt. I think I'm gonna be all right. I... I'm gonna be all right. I'm all right.
[11649.19s -> 11675.61s]  I can do it. I'm going for another win. All right, who wants to fuck around? That was a big mistake.
[11676.33s -> 11695.86s]  It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Fine. I'll... It's all right. I still have my teammate here, right?
[11695.86s -> 11705.18s]  Pretty sure the teammate... Yeah, teammate's still there, right? Oh, too bad. You can grab right here.
[11716.95s -> 11753.56s]  Shit. Well, it looks like it's the... the tower bolt. Let go. Really? That's dirty. That was really dirty.
[11762.86s -> 11769.26s]  Dirty. Really dirty. All right, you're playing dirty. That's fine. That's all right. Got my sights on you now.
[11769.82s -> 11790.74s]  You're gonna play dirty? Okay. All right. That's fine. You're gonna play dirty? I need to have a chance to get off.
[11792.70s -> 11807.48s]  Uh, I'm dead. Um, that guy just... All right. Well, now... Now you're dead. My buddy's up there now.
[11807.48s -> 11821.18s]  Hey, wait. You want a coin right to the head? Oh, I may have made a mistake. I am bad.
[11822.06s -> 11832.86s]  It's okay, though. It's okay. As long as you don't win. Oh, man. I gotta aim much lower than that.
[11843.14s -> 11849.72s]  Okay, I gotta hit this. This is make or break. I have to hit this. Who's in first? Who's in first?
[11851.91s -> 11853.11s]  Oh, would you look at that?
[11855.30s -> 11887.99s]  That's not my stamina though, duckhead. Don't do that. Really?
[11905.21s -> 11925.75s]  Say hi to fucking Satan for me. Oh, the rocket went off. Easy. Look at him. That is... That is like
[11925.75s -> 11950.02s]  rabid. What? How does he hit me like that? There's no way. I still got my buddy over here. Are you good?
[11951.24s -> 11957.83s]  Hey, I'm not going up there. That's a stupid idea. Let's... Hey, hang out down here. Yeah,
[11957.83s -> 11973.46s]  let him do that. No room up there. I... I'm gonna uninstall the game. I'm so fucking bad.
[11979.29s -> 11987.00s]  I tried to hit it. It's okay. I'm still here. And I'm still a fine... I'm still... No, I'm not. It's
[11987.00s -> 12001.42s]  over. Oh my god. I feel so bad. Use me. Use... Just use me. Use me. Use me as a raft. Use me...
[12001.50s -> 12010.38s]  Use me as a raft. Use me as a raft. Use me as a raft. Oh, whatever. Oh. Oh, I punched him right in
[12010.38s -> 12025.22s]  the nose like it couldn't have been cleaner. Right in the face. Yeah. Yeah. This guy. Yeah.
[12030.71s -> 12057.80s]  Get in that racket. I'm gonna smash your head over there. Get out of here. We both need to
[12057.80s -> 12110.63s]  have weapons and we got this in the clear. Oh god. No. He's just beating the shit out of my face.
[12111.35s -> 12160.18s]  Don't ever suspect anything. Oh, my head's underwater. No. Oh, shit. It depends on who has
[12160.18s -> 12162.90s]  the most... How do I... Okay, just... I'm just gonna just explode. Just float. Float. Float. Float.
[12162.90s -> 12192.66s]  Float. Float. I'm just gonna float. I'm gonna conserve all my energy. Why'd I die? Oh, I
[12192.66s -> 12213.19s]  couldn't turn around fast enough. That's a good one. That's a good one. To throw them off the
[12213.19s -> 12225.19s]  submarine. I threw that guy off the submarine three or four times. It's a shame corner. Yeah.
[12234.46s -> 12242.63s]  Late night stream. Uh, kind of, yeah. I was around like eight. I was around like about 430. I
[12242.63s -> 12256.20s]  probably will do more later streams like late night. I know EU does not want to hear that but
[12256.20s -> 12278.33s]  I don't want to start too, too late but around this time is alright. I'm between like four and
[12278.33s -> 12303.19s]  seven, four and six Pacific. How long is the Resident Evil 4 DLC? It's football? Oh, this is
[12303.19s -> 12312.25s]  so... Can we pass it? You have to get a touchdown? This is so cool. Alright, I probably should be
[12312.25s -> 12353.66s]  playing baseball. I wonder if that didn't connect. I got it. Good. What? I got it. I have it. I have
[12353.66s -> 12388.76s]  the ball. I have the ball. There we go. About five to six hours. Okay. Oh, this is free.
[12388.84s -> 12421.38s]  How have you got so much faster than me? Good, good, good, good, good, good throw, good throw.
[12422.54s -> 12463.96s]  Oh. Oh, no stamina. No. Good hit. Yo. Oh, it's not. Wow. Huh? What just happened?
[12484.54s -> 12508.50s]  They better not. They won't do it. Do goals not work anymore? You have to be holding the ball.
[12511.58s -> 12551.85s]  Shoot. I got it. Dang it. Patriots fan. Alright, the same... The Yoshi character just takes it
[12551.85s -> 12558.33s]  every time. That Yoshi character just picks it up and runs every... Okay, I'm not going anywhere.
[12565.83s -> 12578.07s]  This Gumby character. Put it in there. Is his name Prickle? Yeah. Uh-huh. Let me get through
[12578.07s -> 12637.94s]  my defense. Where's, where's, where's... Pass it. Alright, somebody just touch it. Give me this ball.
[12640.12s -> 12675.16s]  No, no, no, no. Oh, he's gonna run away with it. Okay, that's a good attempt. Nice try. Your
[12675.16s -> 12694.33s]  teammate knocks you out like six times. Yeah, this is the way it is. It's fine. Alright, good, good, good.
[12695.05s -> 12715.02s]  Don't let it roll down. Nice. Okay, we're in the game. Chad is helping somebody with their math
[12715.10s -> 12730.41s]  homework. I would don't... I do not... I would not take math homework advice from Chad. You're gonna end up...
[12731.05s -> 12751.80s]  You're gonna end up like on a different continent. Alright, we're back in this. If you throw it, I'll
[12751.80s -> 12785.78s]  get it. I just want to get it down. My Gummy. Did I hit the shark out of 15 people? How did I hit him
[12785.78s -> 12807.98s]  right in the forehead? You're still in it. You get that ball down here and I'm gonna run away with it.
[12807.98s -> 12825.11s]  Somebody just toss it down here and I got it. Get it down here. You can do it. That's their MVP
[12825.11s -> 12858.71s]  right there. I want to get in the picture. I'm always lying down in the pictures. The F-Zero
[12858.71s -> 12886.79s]  update came out right now. I feel like that's a lie. It's true. I was trying so hard doing the
[12886.79s -> 12894.78s]  practice game. I want to do this. Please, somebody vote for this. No one's doing it. Everybody
[12894.78s -> 12912.60s]  picks the soccer or football ones. It looks like trivia. Is it some kind of trivia? I want to see
[12912.60s -> 12951.54s]  it. Alright, we need a new hit here. How is Otto? Otto's doing good. He needs to get his teeth
[12951.54s -> 12966.12s]  cleaned for that. He needs a dental appointment. The game's a little loud. It is kind of loud.
[12967.88s -> 12998.42s]  You're right. Oh, I hit the wrong person. You're quiet too. That might be... I'm leaning back
[12998.42s -> 13005.50s]  quite a bit. That's probably why. This new setup, I'll make sure I... I got to get it a little bit
[13005.50s -> 13034.44s]  more. The word I'm looking for is complete. I'm getting rolled. This is not good. Who even has...
[13034.44s -> 13047.43s]  Oh, you have the ball. Alright. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good. Nice. Wait, did you score on our own goal?
[13048.65s -> 13062.90s]  Wait, I'm confused. What just happened? You're red.
[13063.86s -> 13082.33s]  You're not very good at this. I'm staying all the way back because they just keep barreling
[13082.33s -> 13096.28s]  through everybody and just... Okay, I'm staying back here. Yeah, I know this bullshit. I know
[13096.28s -> 13124.84s]  this bullshit tactic. Get out of here. I tried. What back brace were you using for your VR streams?
[13126.12s -> 13133.82s]  Um, I kind of flip-flopped between just an abdominal band that I would wear.
[13134.78s -> 13140.98s]  Kind of on the upper part of my abdomen. I don't remember the brand though. I think it was just
[13140.98s -> 13154.22s]  like an abdominal band. Not tight. Just kind of there. Are you making shit up? Nope. Uh, the VR
[13154.22s -> 13162.74s]  streams, I have like a jet pack on on some of them. I used to wear a brace for my chest. It was
[13162.74s -> 13170.90s]  like a intercostal pain chest piece. It was okay, but it became pretty clear that it was putting a
[13170.90s -> 13177.48s]  little too much pressure on my body and wearing something like that for three, four, five, six,
[13177.48s -> 13185.56s]  seven hours sometimes was like, uh, this, I should not be doing this. No, no, I'm, I'm quitting. I'm
[13185.56s -> 13210.28s]  rage quitting. I don't want to play soccer again. How are you doing now? It's still there. Eh,
[13210.28s -> 13234.90s]  it's all right. Pick a map from the main menu. Maybe stretch before. Yeah. So not to get into
[13234.90s -> 13244.14s]  it again for the millionth time, but I just realistically have to go just, just do hernia
[13244.14s -> 13249.11s]  surgery. I think that's really what it is. And I, I said that like a year or two ago and I just
[13249.11s -> 13259.22s]  never did it, but that might not even be the problem. The last doctor I went to that I had a,
[13259.22s -> 13263.78s]  an upper endoscopy, they were like, yeah, you have a idle hernia, but it really shouldn't be
[13263.78s -> 13274.09s]  causing those problems. Like, oh, oh shit. And then you kind of start convincing yourself. No,
[13274.09s -> 13292.09s]  it has to be that. No, it has to be. It's not, it's nothing else. Get in there. But I'm good.
[13292.09s -> 13296.92s]  I'm good. I would tell you if I wasn't, I was pretty transparent about it a few years ago,
[13301.35s -> 13307.43s]  just managing it. And then maybe I'll just go in and get surgery done to see if it does anything.
[13309.80s -> 13320.25s]  It was officially costochondritis, but I don't know. I don't know if I agree with that. I don't
[13320.25s -> 13340.23s]  know. Yeah. I don't want to play. I want to hit people with shovels. I don't want to play soccer.
[13340.95s -> 13362.76s]  This has 100% less shovel gameplay. Would it be you're just old baby? I mean, that would be kind
[13362.76s -> 13371.74s]  of weird because this started and it's been a while. It's been a long time now. I remember
[13371.74s -> 13376.26s]  telling doctors being like, oh yeah, it's been going on for like two or three years now. And
[13376.26s -> 13385.62s]  that was 2019, 2020. Right. It's weird how you kind of just get used to something and then just
[13385.62s -> 13393.96s]  try to not let it dominate your entire life. And don't get me wrong. I am fine. Like this is not
[13393.96s -> 13402.01s]  like debilitating at all. It's just there. It can get a little rough sometimes if I'm,
[13402.01s -> 13405.53s]  if I said a certain way or I kind of stand up for too long or sit for too long.
[13406.33s -> 13418.94s]  Just had hernia surgery three weeks ago. I hope it fixes whatever is going on with you. No,
[13419.90s -> 13449.62s]  don't do it. This dude eats goat cheese. Definitely. I do. I like the bear that right
[13449.62s -> 13483.32s]  to the left. I love that. I want one of those. I wish there was a dance. Oh no. You had to eat a
[13483.32s -> 13494.38s]  whole frozen stick of butter in 30 minutes. How would you do it? Uh, I wouldn't, but if I had to,
[13495.83s -> 13505.26s]  if I had to probably just melt it down and drink it. That seems the least awful way.
[13508.92s -> 13513.32s]  What's the stipulation here? Do I have to eat it whole or can I put it in something? But I just
[13513.32s -> 13519.08s]  have a wicked gross fettuccine Alfredo that has like a ton of butter in it. Fettuccine Alfredo
[13519.08s -> 13524.62s]  already has a stick of butter in it. So I'll just eat some fettuccine Alfredo. I think I've
[13524.62s -> 13543.85s]  solved your conundrum. I feel like I'm not doing anything, but I also feel like I'm doing a lot.
[13544.41s -> 13568.57s]  Just by being a presence back here. See, we won. I did not play. Prove you can make
[13568.57s -> 13573.43s]  fettuccine Alfredo. I don't need, I don't know how to make fettuccine Alfredo. I don't know,
[13573.43s -> 13582.34s]  butter, shredded cheese, flour, uh, water. I don't even know what's in fettuccine Alfredo.
[13582.98s -> 13603.37s]  I know it's like cream, cream, butter, salt, garlic, a little bit of au jus. You know what I
[13603.37s -> 13611.22s]  had? Oh man. So my mother made this for me. If you didn't know, I was visiting with my mother
[13612.39s -> 13621.42s]  all the way around. And my mother made, it's great to see her by the way. It's been a while.
[13621.42s -> 13630.22s]  She tries to make the trip every year or two, but it was wonderful. She taught me how to make
[13630.22s -> 13636.65s]  a poached egg because I've tried a million times and I can't do it. But a poached egg on a piece
[13636.65s -> 13650.81s]  of toast, jammy in the middle, forget about it. That's the worst egg. Oh no, no. You just haven't
[13650.81s -> 13659.37s]  had it made right. Trust me. I've had poached eggs that were just disgusting boogers. I get it. But
[13659.37s -> 13665.10s]  a good poached egg, I think is probably the best kind of egg, but they're just so annoying to make.
[13665.66s -> 13675.45s]  It's really easy to mess them up. All right, we're going gorilla. Take a piece of toast
[13675.45s -> 13685.83s]  or two, two pieces of toast, butter the toast. Nice and buttery. Drop that egg, that poached egg
[13685.83s -> 13694.17s]  right on top and just start carving it out with a fork and knife and eating it like steak. So,
[13694.89s -> 13731.83s]  so good. I'm putting these in the right side, right? This is not the wrong way, is it?
[13731.83s -> 13735.75s]  Yeah, I've heard, uh, my mother talked about the, uh, vinegar, the, I can't say the word,
[13735.75s -> 13742.57s]  the vinegar trick. Yeah, poached eggs get really stringy, but if you add vinegar to the water
[13743.93s -> 13757.32s]  just a tiny bit, it makes it so it doesn't get so stringy. I'm trying, trying to get him up here.
[13762.10s -> 13770.66s]  He's faking his accent. What? What accent? He's faking his accent? What am I doing?
[13771.22s -> 13775.83s]  What am I doing? I, I'm not aware of it, whatever it is. What did I do? What did I say?
[13781.19s -> 13786.84s]  Am I faking it? I don't know. I don't, I'm not even aware of the word. He just got exposed. I
[13786.84s -> 13793.66s]  don't even know what you mean. What word did I say? Mother. Oh, but that's just how you say it.
[13800.90s -> 13809.16s]  He just went down. Oh, are you referring to what I just said? Forget about it.
[13810.12s -> 13840.78s]  Yeah, that was a little weird. I agree. Oh, look at that pig. You do feel more powerful when you're
[13840.78s -> 13860.58s]  the gorilla. Confirmed. Where are you taking it? Get it through the door. Get that pig.
[13863.75s -> 13886.94s]  I gotta get this pig. Oh my goodness. Oh my god, I ruined everything. Whoa, we are moving with this
[13886.94s -> 13914.44s]  now. Holy shit. We're on point. Pull it. Here we go. Nice. We moved. We went so quick. Oh,
[13914.44s -> 13937.91s]  I almost had 11 cookies. That pig was a bat. Oh, a watching bacon and cookies. 12,000. I don't
[13937.91s -> 13948.74s]  really want this stuff though. This one's kind of cool. Yeah, I'll get this one. You're not saying
[13948.74s -> 13977.19s]  it in the right voice. Yeah, true. Cookies. There you go. Oh, did you mean the Mario version?
[13980.25s -> 13996.07s]  Cookies. Well, you got both. I've already dunked your cookie in milk. I've never seen this one.
[13996.07s -> 14010.09s]  I thought that said butthole lab. Uh, stay away from the black hole and stay alive. So you take
[14010.09s -> 14015.72s]  the cookie if it's an Oreo or if it's a chocolate chip, doesn't matter. You just dunk it halfway.
[14016.98s -> 14038.47s]  Count to 10. Take it out. Tap, tap. Bite. Yeah, that's a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Pull it
[14038.47s -> 14048.79s]  out. I want it soft, but I don't want it to be mushy. How incompetent do you think we are? No,
[14049.75s -> 14055.14s]  that's not what I said. Somebody asked how I dip my cookies in milk. I didn't say every single
[14055.14s -> 14072.90s]  person needs to do it like this or you're stupid, but you are if you don't. One omega lull in a sea
[14072.90s -> 14081.40s]  of D faces. Hey, hey, hey, hey, you and me get it. Hey, you and me get it. You know what I mean?
[14081.40s -> 14131.38s]  This is a cool skin. I like it. All right, don't go in the black hole. Am I doing it right? I think
[14131.38s -> 14147.83s]  I just broke my neck. Is he all right? Uh-oh. I think I might be wedged in this. Don't tell him.
[14147.83s -> 14164.70s]  I think I just automatically won the game. I think I'm stuck in here. Am I? Something is wedged here
[14164.70s -> 14170.18s]  and I can't really figure it out. Oh, I was stuck in the, no, maybe I wasn't. That was weird. I
[14170.18s -> 14195.48s]  couldn't move. Oh, that's what just happened. Everybody's a gorilla. Oh, that was an amazing
[14195.48s -> 14223.26s]  shot. It's midair. I mean, strategy is obviously grab the cane. They feel about just straight up
[14223.26s -> 14231.80s]  milk. Sometimes people treat me like I'm the devil for drinking milk. You do whatever you want. You
[14231.80s -> 14237.78s]  you should do eat. You should you should care about whatever you want to care about. Like
[14237.78s -> 14248.04s]  things you like. Somebody says it's gross that you drink, uh, you drank, um, like almond milk
[14248.04s -> 14269.61s]  or something or regular milk or oat milk. Okay. Every time I talk about the milk that I like,
[14270.17s -> 14276.65s]  it's almost like I like almond milk. Well, almond milk is bad. Oh, regular milk. Regular milk is
[14276.65s -> 14283.77s]  bad too. Oh, what about, um, oat milk? Oat milk sucks. It's bad. It's really bad. Everything's bad.
[14284.73s -> 14315.16s]  Uh, uh, rice, milk, soy milk. I just want my coffee to taste a little creamier. I've somehow
[14315.16s -> 14321.78s]  made it all the way. Oh, milk is good, but it depends on the brand. Yeah. I like oat milk right
[14321.78s -> 14335.43s]  now. I think oatmeal tastes the best out of all of them. I was just missed and went over. That
[14335.43s -> 14346.54s]  would have been so funny. Where's the chain? It's over here, isn't it? That's bad. I didn't even get
[14346.54s -> 14370.22s]  anything. I got this guy though. All right. We're good. No, that's my friend. It's just a cat and
[14370.22s -> 14384.18s]  three gorillas. Why do I feel like they're on the same team even though they're not? No, get away.
[14384.18s -> 14393.77s]  It's mine. Fine. He just knocked me out. You better hold onto me. You'd better hold onto me
[14393.77s -> 14420.01s]  this whole time. Dude, you killed us both. I love matcha. I just wanted to call him a freak. Matcha
[14420.01s -> 14436.62s]  is great too. Ooh. Well, we have to even the odds. Is that going to hit him? It skimmed right over
[14436.62s -> 14456.14s]  his head. How long have we gone without talking about milk? Don't you guys feel like it's sometimes
[14456.14s -> 14470.52s]  it's like once every two weeks, bro. You just absolute. You know what? Yeah. There you go.
[14471.16s -> 14482.44s]  There you go. Yep. I'm going to hit somebody right in the head. What team am I on? Okay. I'm on yellow.
[14486.52s -> 14491.74s]  Well, you stream once every two weeks, so yeah. We just talk about milk every single time I'm live.
[14492.38s -> 14510.55s]  So you say, oh, milk, but almond milk. I'm going to be such a bastard here. All right. I want to
[14510.55s -> 14538.58s]  avoid hitting you. Oh, that's going to be so sad. Is it going to get anybody? No. Stop engaging in
[14538.58s -> 14545.38s]  the conversation. I like that conversation. It's fun, but also to something to keep in mind.
[14545.46s -> 14552.54s]  How many people here? It's very possible that there's like 11,000, like 10,000 very much.
[14552.54s -> 14556.06s]  Oh shit. I just clicked back into the window and threw the bomb into the trash.
[14557.42s -> 14561.50s]  All right. So if this 10,000 people here, it's very possible that this 10,000 people
[14562.14s -> 14567.82s]  is a different 10,000 people next time. And the time after that, it could be like another
[14567.82s -> 14576.89s]  10,000 different people. Everyone's not all here at the same exact time at the same exact stream.
[14586.44s -> 14593.19s]  So if we talk about, uh, oat milk, we might be talking to a completely different group of people.
[14593.83s -> 14637.69s]  I still got it. It's okay. Oh, what? No, give it to me. Aha. That's a win right there. At least
[14637.69s -> 14663.88s]  it should be. Pick them up already. Why did that explode? Okay. Are you high? No, I'm just chilling
[14663.88s -> 14686.68s]  man. Hey, I've done that a million times before. I know how it feels. Dude, don't. You're doing it
[14686.68s -> 14709.77s]  on purpose. Of course they are. How would it be on accident? You're just dropping people left and
[14709.77s -> 14728.78s]  right. This. Why am I, am I holding it? He's holding it with one hand. Why? Put both hands
[14728.78s -> 14779.08s]  on it, please. Oh, you're getting dunked. Hey, we did it. On the ground again. Milk and Pepsi.
[14779.08s -> 14788.17s]  I drank the, the pilk on stream. Weird, but it was okay. I would never drink it again, but
[14788.17s -> 14804.33s]  I wouldn't spit it out. I love pilk. Hashtag pilk fan. If we have an opportunity, please vote for
[14804.33s -> 14811.61s]  that one. One person voted for that. One person voted for it and we're going there. Two of us
[14811.61s -> 14825.62s]  voted on the right one. Everybody wants to play sports. I just want to beat people up with shovels.
[14825.62s -> 14858.30s]  I need to read this because I, I don't even know what it is. Oh no, I don't. Okay, never mind. What just hit me?
[14858.30s -> 14877.74s]  Oh, it was the puck. All right. And there it is. No, there's a cow. I love that. I want that.
[14878.38s -> 14926.10s]  That's the best skin in the whole game. It's just so perfect. Big fat orange cat is cool too.
[14926.10s -> 14943.22s]  God, that was a good block. That was good. Damn it. I wasn't, if I was lined up right there,
[14943.94s -> 14959.50s]  it was just a little to the left. Okay. Oh, it's perfect. Somebody to get it. It's right there.
[14959.50s -> 15001.78s]  Look. Set me up. Set me up. Damn it. I think I'm going to get an opportunity right. Get it out of
[15001.78s -> 15072.58s]  the corner. Ouch. Do not. Wow. I thought that went in. Is it in? This is a pretty good game so far.
[15072.58s -> 15097.78s]  Sorry. Sorry. Not sorry. Racist. Do something about racist. Mean Geno. I'm trying. I had it first.
[15097.78s -> 15103.30s]  Macho Man is a voice that if you can do it, you can sometimes do it for like three seconds and
[15103.30s -> 15124.57s]  then it just turns into something else. Yeah. Let me tell you. Let me tell you. Let me. Macho Man.
[15124.57s -> 15146.84s]  Randy Savage. I'm trying to do a voice. Don't punch me. Cream of the crop. They'll just never
[15146.84s -> 15151.48s]  be another Macho Man. Randy Savage. There's a lot of those guys that just, they'll never be another
[15151.48s -> 15170.82s]  one ever again. Ever. All right. I want to get lined up. This cow is a good goalie. We got to
[15170.82s -> 15187.32s]  get that shield away from you. Right now. A lot of you might not know this, but you know the way
[15187.32s -> 15192.86s]  that I talk sometimes where I talk like this. Emphasizing a lot of the W's. That's Mean Gene
[15192.86s -> 15200.46s]  Oakland. Mean Gene Oakland was a huge, huge influence on like voice stuff. He had this
[15200.46s -> 15209.88s]  incredibly particular way of talking. He was a master at it. You just did it in your own goal?
[15209.88s -> 15245.78s]  Oh, sorry. Oops. I'll make up for it right now. Get up. What? Oh, I thought we got a goal because
[15245.78s -> 15257.18s]  he put the shield in his own goal. That's weird. Set me up. Set me up. Set me up. Set me up. Set
[15257.18s -> 15289.88s]  me up. I'll be goalie. That's fine. I keep getting clocked by this thing every time. That's a
[15289.88s -> 15305.90s]  beautiful setup. Oh yes. There we go. I haven't seen him contribute in any way. You must have
[15305.90s -> 15309.34s]  just came to the stream because I'm the one that got the first goal and it was a beautiful shot.
[15311.02s -> 15328.02s]  Like this. Good tie. Oh no, we won. He was the team's clown. Yeah, I have to entertain everybody.
[15328.90s -> 15354.54s]  The goal. I finally got my face in a picture. No more sports. More shovel. Yeah, that's what I'm
[15354.54s -> 15373.18s]  saying. You always feel the compulsive need to entertain everybody. I think that just comes
[15373.18s -> 15380.79s]  with not being able to sit still. So talking a lot is a way to expel a lot of energy.
[15386.02s -> 15394.12s]  Which I usually have a lot of. Maybe not so much anymore, but I still do. 10 years ago, 15 years ago,
[15394.12s -> 15399.08s]  I was just a ball of just energy that had to constantly be doing something or talking or
[15399.08s -> 15406.31s]  moving. I've definitely mellowed out a lot in the last five years, I'd say. Without a doubt.
[15406.31s -> 15442.92s]  You're a mellow yellow. Do I? Wait a minute. That's soda, right? It's a drink. Just block them all.
[15443.56s -> 15449.19s]  That's a great strategy. Make it so they can't get over here.
[15449.75s -> 15467.61s]  I don't have stamina. How are we holding hands backwards behind? That was very strange.
[15469.70s -> 15482.89s]  God damn it. Is Mountain Dew for boring people? I didn't even mean to do that and I hit my own
[15482.89s -> 15494.54s]  teammate. No, I didn't. OK, I'm on green this time. Mellow yellow is boring? I feel like that's the
[15494.54s -> 15498.14s]  opposite because wouldn't Mountain Dew be the default and that's just the one to get because
[15498.14s -> 15503.48s]  it's Mountain Dew because it's everywhere and it's the popular one? Mellow yellow to me is no,
[15503.48s -> 15509.08s]  we don't got Mountain Dew. We got mellow yellow. It's like, whoa, interesting. You've got,
[15509.08s -> 15518.02s]  I haven't seen that in a while. That's like having squirt in your fridge. It's like,
[15518.02s -> 15525.05s]  oh shit, you've got, you've got squirt? I would have thought it would have been a Sprite.
[15541.27s -> 15549.03s]  Oh, whatever. I don't care. I don't even care. I don't care. Oh shit.
[15559.58s -> 15574.94s]  Oh, that was very embarrassing, but it's OK. I just forgot to hold right trigger to grab onto
[15574.94s -> 15608.44s]  the ledge and just hit my teeth off the ledge. Squirt is a good soda. One of the best. Not
[15608.44s -> 15632.74s]  messing around this time. Wow, nice. Ooh, tiger skin. There are a lot more models in this game
[15632.74s -> 15644.84s]  than I thought there were going to be. Highlord Tyrion Fordring needs you, champion. The Lich
[15644.84s -> 15657.46s]  King must be stopped. Yeah, I also can sit in Dalaran for 60 minutes a day and hear that
[15658.50s -> 15680.95s]  two or three times. One shot, one shot, one shot to get up. Please get up. One shot. You're going
[15680.95s -> 15695.21s]  to get us both killed. You're going to get us both killed. Who's your favorite Dragonball Z
[15695.21s -> 15712.73s]  character? Who's the one that goes like this? Boo. That's right. That's the one. I'm alive,
[15712.73s -> 15733.72s]  right? I'm holding it. Not Mr. Satan. No, it's not Boo. I don't give a shit about Boo
[15733.72s -> 15748.95s]  at all. I just thought it'd be funny to do that for five seconds. It's Mr. Satan. It's not Mr.
[15748.95s -> 15753.03s]  Satan. I just like that voice. So I say it's my favorite character, but it's actually Beerus.
[15753.83s -> 15772.65s]  Fuck that guy. It's Goku. You know what I mean? And that's how you tell everybody
[15773.37s -> 15783.77s]  your top four favorite DBZ character. He's on the wiki looking at them all.
[15785.21s -> 15790.17s]  In the beginning of the stream, I told you I was lying down. I don't have Wikipedia over here.
[15790.89s -> 15801.26s]  I'm lying in one of those beanbag chair, upright chair things on the ground. I don't
[15801.26s -> 15821.00s]  got Wikipedia. You lost viewers for that? Oh, they weren't strong enough. I thought
[15821.00s -> 15828.36s]  you were going to punch me, but you didn't. So I'm not going to punch you. Look at that tiger.
[15829.16s -> 15839.77s]  That's so sad. That's so sad. He made it? What? I just knocked myself out?
[15848.52s -> 15853.26s]  I was trying to. Okay. I did not know that could happen.
[15857.85s -> 15888.65s]  You got styled on. I did. You're right. We still got a shot. Oh, now you're all in trouble.
[15889.45s -> 15918.23s]  That was my friend, but it's okay. It's not here yet. Please lift that up. Don't leave me hanging.
[15919.32s -> 15943.51s]  Keep it up. Thank you. Oh, we got a 2v1 scenario, don't we? No. Did I die?
[15946.38s -> 15969.19s]  I'm dead. I didn't even know that was possible. That alligator is so fucked up right now.
[15973.54s -> 16009.37s]  Stop. Somebody has to pull the lever. I'll do it. What's this? Is this a helmet?
[16014.42s -> 16049.51s]  My buddy's still here. Oh, shit. Don't. What? It broke. It broke. Why am I getting the three
[16049.51s -> 16068.92s]  stooges shit happening to me all the time? All right. That's not a bad photo. Preferred
[16068.92s -> 16078.06s]  brand vacuum cleaner. A stick vacuum. I don't have to plug it in. I'm a mover. I'm like a
[16078.06s -> 16084.10s]  cellar spider when I vacuum. I'm just up all over the place. I'll start in the corner in one room.
[16084.10s -> 16089.30s]  I'll just walk to the other room and just go in the other room. In the bedroom. One, two, three.
[16089.30s -> 16098.84s]  Just walk across the fucking hall. Just go across to the other room. In the bathroom. Just zooming
[16098.84s -> 16107.40s]  around with a stick vacuum. Because when you don't have a stick vacuum, you end up having
[16107.40s -> 16112.06s]  you're tethered to the plug. Vacuum a whole room with a plug in the wall and all of a sudden it's
[16112.06s -> 16117.82s]  like, yeah, I got to unplug this. Pick this up. It's kind of heavy. I got a bag. I got to move to
[16117.82s -> 16124.09s]  another room. Where's an outlet? Am I going to have the problem where I vacuum too far where
[16124.09s -> 16129.75s]  the outlet can't reach and there's just one strip that is just never done because I just don't care
[16129.75s -> 16145.32s]  about the vacuum can't go that far? Stick vacuum. Add coal into the furnace to speed up your train.
[16145.32s -> 16160.18s]  Okay. Bro, what's the brand? We don't want to rant. Um, I had a Dyson stick vacuum,
[16160.82s -> 16170.95s]  but I broke it. I have it. A Dyson is like, it's like a Cadillac. I just, I, I don't want to get
[16170.95s -> 16180.47s]  another one. Cause what if I break that one? And they're very expensive. One of my friends came
[16180.47s -> 16187.05s]  over one time and they thought I had one of those standing hand sanitizers in the corner of the
[16187.05s -> 16193.43s]  room. Like they were like, why do you have a big hand sanitizer? I was like, that's not what that
[16193.51s -> 16203.64s]  is. Cause it does kind of look like one. It looks like a big standing hand sanitizer. He was like,
[16203.64s -> 16206.92s]  I was going to go over and put my hand underneath it. I thought you were a weirdo for a second,
[16206.92s -> 16246.20s]  but it's a vacuum. What train am I putting this? I never played this one before. Holy
[16246.20s -> 16286.62s]  shit. Drop it. That was a big one too. Let's go put them in the furnace. Oh, that was a bad idea.
[16300.02s -> 16305.16s]  Damn it. All right. They're ahead of us. Forget about that guy. He's just going to troll us.
[16320.46s -> 16350.28s]  Okay. What does this do? Is it the gas? I didn't know if you had to heat it up.
[16350.84s -> 16365.85s]  Why would you break? Oh, but why? Oh, I get it. I was saying, why is there a lever on? I get it.
[16365.85s -> 16375.70s]  I get it. I get it. All right. We're going to, we'll be fine. Oh my God. You are shit face.
[16375.70s -> 16413.72s]  Just get it in. I'm so sad. I'm an anchor right now. Misjudge the jump just a little.
[16414.44s -> 16445.61s]  Steal this too. Oh, give me the shovel. We're winning. I was such an annoying distraction.
[16445.61s -> 16483.38s]  We won. My head. Fuck you. We did it. Oops. Yeah. They're not halfway there. We've
[16484.02s -> 16516.04s]  been by a mile. I got it. Yes. I want that one. I got it. I did not think I was going to be playing
[16516.04s -> 16531.03s]  this for almost five hours, but it's really fun. How do you feel about boiled peanuts?
[16532.36s -> 16538.70s]  I don't know if I've ever had them. I don't really know. I ate them. What are they in?
[16539.42s -> 16567.51s]  You just eat them by themselves. I don't think I've ever had it before. So do you take the
[16567.51s -> 16578.28s]  peanuts out of the shells or is it in the shells? And then you take them out in the shells. Okay.
[16578.28s -> 16591.03s]  You know what? You take them out. How long do you boil them in the shells for in water?
[16595.56s -> 16609.77s]  They're so good. Seven hours. You do it for a couple of what you boil them for hours.
[16615.06s -> 16624.49s]  I kind of am interested in this though. So not you just talking about like on the stovetop.
[16624.49s -> 16646.04s]  I feel like that would be kind of crazy. Rock pot will do it. Yeah. On low heat. Let me take
[16646.04s -> 16657.16s]  care of this guy. This person just had a bunch of groceries in their hands. That was so sad.
[16657.16s -> 16666.10s]  This is one of those games where you just giggle. Wait, you mean I can smash somebody's head with
[16666.10s -> 16689.85s]  this? We got to go. You got it. We got to shove it in. Just kick it in. Kick it. Punch it. How
[16689.85s -> 16693.53s]  do you do emotes? There we go. That was weird. It was like I was trying to press left stick,
[16693.53s -> 16702.06s]  right stick. That was so lucky that we got this immediate spawn. If the team is AFK. Oh,
[16702.06s -> 16735.98s]  that's sad. All right. Good job. You didn't have to go in too. We can let them get one gumdrop.
[16735.98s -> 16754.78s]  Right? We can't just take them all. We got the perfect placement on this too. This is the way
[16754.78s -> 16781.69s]  to do it. And they were AFK. Oh, I just won a quick match without being knocked out. I don't
[16781.77s -> 16814.10s]  know where I am. Oh, I got money. Let's open up one of those surprise eggs. 200. So if I
[16814.74s -> 16837.00s]  1080, I feel like that's going to take a while. Yeah. I want one now. It's green. What is it?
[16837.00s -> 16866.52s]  Is that like epic or something? Cute. Pink sparky. Uncommon. Dark ancient underbite.
[16866.52s -> 16901.45s]  Don't I already have this? I want to see those ones. What were those? Dark ooga. Okay. But could
[16901.45s -> 16924.79s]  you beat Goku though? Yes. I 100%. I 100% could beat Goku at rock, paper, scissors. Maybe spend
[16924.79s -> 16950.47s]  five grand on skins. No. Can you even use real money? You can. All right. I got some cool stuff.
[16950.47s -> 16965.99s]  What'd I get? I got a melon hat. How do I change outfit? Oh, there we go. Melon hat or do that one.
[16965.99s -> 16979.03s]  I mean, maybe I get a little, like a little bit of the in-game currency, but I'm going to spend
[16979.03s -> 16999.91s]  $5,000. That's too much. How did we fuck that up? How did we screw that up? I was going to say that
[16999.91s -> 17020.71s]  was three knuckleheads. Yeah. I think the game's definitely worth it. Especially if you have a
[17020.71s -> 17031.85s]  group of friends. This is one of those ultimate party games and the varieties there. I thought
[17031.85s -> 17049.54s]  this was going to be four maps or so. I was completely wrong. And yeah, it's on. I thought
[17049.54s -> 17061.43s]  that was one of my teammates pissed that I kept trying to grab the ball. Can somebody get it in
[17061.43s -> 17070.01s]  there? It's on Game Pass. That's right. Ace Attorney is coming to Game Pass. You have no excuse now.
[17070.01s -> 17108.07s]  Okay. True. That's true. Trying to run away with it here. Don't tease me like that. I'll play. I'm
[17108.07s -> 17116.23s]  definitely not going to play the whole series. I'm not going to do all of them. I'll try one or two
[17116.23s -> 17135.30s]  cases because I don't know how much I like those games. Genuinely. I've never played one. I have
[17135.30s -> 17143.16s]  downloaded them on four separate devices over the course of 10 years, but I haven't played it.
[17144.44s -> 17157.45s]  I know. It's weird. I've gotten it on iPad, on Steam, on what was the like, like a PS4.
[17159.88s -> 17164.36s]  I've just, I buy it every single console generation with the intent that I'm going to play it.
[17164.44s -> 17183.70s]  And I just don't. They're not great stream games. Yeah. But I mean, I got a new philosophy anyways,
[17183.70s -> 17189.64s]  right? Doesn't everything doesn't have to be, oh, it's going to be really high energy and
[17190.20s -> 17196.42s]  tons of interaction. And maybe it's just fun to do one day just to hang out and play it.
[17199.08s -> 17201.32s]  A lot of reading out loud. Well, I do sorcery. Sorcery is fun.
[17202.12s -> 17219.86s]  Kind of the same thing, right? Yeah. I've said a thousand year door. That's the one where Luigi
[17219.86s -> 17247.85s]  goes. I'll give it a try. That was a great walk down there by player 244. I'll tell you what I'm
[17247.85s -> 17257.37s]  the most excited for besides Elden Rings DLC. WarioWare. They're going back to the basics
[17257.37s -> 17273.00s]  on WarioWare. That is, I'm going to play the absolute hell out of that game. I'm going,
[17273.00s -> 17285.70s]  I'm going to try to 100% that game. I hope it's good. You can swear, you know, right?
[17287.42s -> 17298.49s]  Yeah. But my mother was just here and I'm kind of used to being a little more, a little more tame.
[17299.59s -> 17302.79s]  All right, everybody, if you're in the game right now, dude, oh, we're doing icebreaker.
[17302.79s -> 17314.23s]  I want to, what is that one? But you're almost 40. It doesn't matter how, if you're 30, 40, 50,
[17314.23s -> 17318.95s]  nobody wants to be like, oh, fuck this. Fuck you. And fuck that and fucking whatever.
[17318.95s -> 17342.55s]  It's my mother. You're going to come on. My mom cusses a lot. Yeah. My mother swears too a lot.
[17343.19s -> 17353.43s]  My mother and father both swear. It was never like weird, but I tone it down. You tone it down
[17353.43s -> 17376.34s]  a little bit. You don't want to, you just don't want to overdo it in front of ma and dad. My mom
[17376.34s -> 17392.07s]  is here. How come you're not playing this? I'm sure your mother would think this was fun. I'm
[17392.07s -> 17406.87s]  sure your mother would love this game. Why you guys should play it. Family friendly streamer.
[17406.87s -> 17421.40s]  Stay tuned. Coming up next. We got, can't think of anything funny. Just imagine I was pretending
[17421.40s -> 17444.60s]  to be a like G rated person. Okay. So how do we feel about that? I somehow got the W on that one.
[17444.60s -> 17473.02s]  And I don't know how. You're watching the Disney channel. Oh, that's also a dinosaur.
[17487.59s -> 17515.59s]  Ooh. Oh, that shut the whole crowd up. I just slipped on the banana field. All right. We're
[17515.59s -> 17541.85s]  good. Sorry, mom. They were Yoshis before. Yeah, that's true. They can stay Yoshis. My shovel.
[17546.06s -> 17568.79s]  I did not hit my head on the shovel. Right. We can all agree on that. Shit. Oh, that's not good.
[17571.56s -> 17587.16s]  That's bad. Not good. I'm going to die. I'm so greedy. I want it so bad. And now I'm dead.
[17588.87s -> 17618.06s]  Now I think I'm dead. I'm so sorry. I forgot you were on my team. Get me away from the edge.
[17634.44s -> 17648.55s]  Damn it. Oh, that's so sad. That's very sad. I couldn't get him with the, I still have a
[17648.55s -> 17678.63s]  teammate in here, right? Not anymore. Too slippery. Is this a bit? Uh, no, it's just when the changing
[17678.63s -> 17686.30s]  teams like one round, you're on green one game. You're on blue one. You're on red. Oh my God.
[17686.30s -> 17728.92s]  That was a great shot. Oh, I hit him. I had this exact same idea and we both missed. You leave him,
[17728.92s -> 17747.30s]  but leave him alone. Leave him alone. This is my friend. That was a dangerous move, but it was
[17747.30s -> 17788.50s]  worth it. Oh, I took his head off. Just jumped over it. Let go of the shovel and get up, bro.
[17789.22s -> 17797.38s]  What are you doing? I couldn't drop the shovel. I couldn't drop the shovel.
[17797.94s -> 17810.30s]  It was just still in my hands. Oh, I got you. I got you. I got you. You got it. I know you got
[17810.30s -> 17831.67s]  this. Roman, Roman, Roman. That's teamwork right there. You can do it. No, it was a good try.
[17832.23s -> 17863.82s]  Nice try. Anybody's game. I, I, I have no defense on that. I don't have a defense on what just
[17863.82s -> 17871.34s]  happened. Dude, you're going to kill yourself too. You're going to die down here too. It's not worth
[17871.34s -> 17887.91s]  it. You, you, it's not worth it. Trust me. Just get up there. See, forget about the bat. No,
[17888.71s -> 17912.17s]  you okay? Don't get on this. I'm dead. I was just way too far away. I wouldn't have made it.
[17912.73s -> 17945.32s]  Is my buddy still here? No. He doesn't see it. You're a bad teammate. I accidentally hit him.
[17945.32s -> 17950.06s]  I protected him at least two or three times, but it was the one time that I hit him in the head
[17950.06s -> 17968.44s]  with the shovel. You guys are going to keep going back to a lot of stuff. All right. Deny yellow at
[17968.44s -> 18022.76s]  all costs. That was the plan. Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up. All right. Dunk him. As long
[18022.76s -> 18047.93s]  as I don't go in the water, I don't care. Shit. That's bad. Oh, thank God. I just can't catch a
[18047.93s -> 18067.32s]  break. Get me up. Oh, what? How am I still here? Time for you to go for a fucking swim.
[18086.71s -> 18099.94s]  Oh shit. Shovel versus pan. Oh shit. Oh, I thought I had an extra half second. No,
[18102.47s -> 18114.82s]  he got me with the very, very end of it. It was like the tip of the top of it. He had the length.
[18114.82s -> 18121.19s]  Yeah. I was always going to be hard. He had a full foot on me and what he could be able to swing
[18121.19s -> 18148.30s]  with. I made it in the picture. All right. Last one. Last one. And then I am going to go eat some
[18148.30s -> 18162.26s]  dinner and I'm going to go chill. What's the other game I said I wanted to play? Oh,
[18162.26s -> 18178.60s]  Resident Evil 4 DLC. Uh, we got to close it on a typhoon. It's the best one. F 0 99 and the DLC
[18178.60s -> 18199.67s]  for Resident Evil 4. He's addicted to the funny animal game. Oh, it's great. It's great. Let me
[18199.67s -> 18217.48s]  think of some good. Let me look at the calendar. Maybe Sunday, Sunday or Monday. All right. I got
[18217.48s -> 18238.34s]  to go out big. So my best games were with the cat. When are you going to stream? Uh, either Sunday
[18238.34s -> 18244.65s]  or Monday or this week? Likely Monday. Monday makes the most sense for me. Schedule wise.
[18245.37s -> 18278.84s]  It's going to be annoying over here. No, you don't understand. It's the boat. That's the problem.
[18278.84s -> 18291.46s]  It's the boat. That's the problem. We need to fight the boat. You guys don't get it. They want
[18291.46s -> 18309.61s]  us to fucking kill each other and then they'll get all the snacks. Oh God. Watch out. I'm just
[18309.61s -> 18324.49s]  climbing up. If there's ever a game that I wish the floss was in, it's this one because I would
[18324.49s -> 18359.08s]  just do it right here. Welcome. What the hell was that? I don't think a bird shit on me. Oh,
[18359.88s -> 18368.38s]  I don't think any of us are going to get out of here. Yeah, there's, there's no getting up.
[18370.18s -> 18397.66s]  Okay. Now there is, this is a victory for sure. Come on, come on. I had more health than you did.
[18399.90s -> 18429.03s]  I had more health than you. Didn't I? Oh, but cracked out right now. Hey, what's up? You piece
[18429.03s -> 18443.72s]  of shit. Oh, that's my friend. So fucking sorry. I'm so sorry. He's AFK. Whatever. It doesn't matter.
[18443.72s -> 18460.73s]  It's not like he was playing anyways. Oh boy. I might be in trouble. I don't think I have enough
[18460.73s -> 18504.33s]  stamina to get up all the way. Oh, it's going to be close. Okay. You dummy. Oh no, my friend. Oh,
[18509.82s -> 18527.35s]  stay up back into the cockpit again. I was going to spam the head butt button and see what happens.
[18536.60s -> 18540.68s]  He was just left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right to my face
[18540.68s -> 18567.42s]  and killed me. Come on, man. Yeah, that was all wind up in the face. Right hand,
[18567.98s -> 18575.75s]  elbow up, back, left hand in the face. Repeat 10 times. I was not going to get up from that.
[18576.31s -> 18608.39s]  I'm going off the stop rope. Oh, the rocket came out. I just got rocked. Come on. It's right there.
[18608.39s -> 18622.34s]  Grab it. It's right here. Put somebody in the missile silo. I got somebody in the very beginning
[18622.34s -> 18629.64s]  of the stream. Dammit. Well, let's see if I can blow somebody up. Is my teammate still here?
[18630.44s -> 18646.06s]  Oh no, they're AFK now. Good placement. Yes. Holy shit. That was diabolical, dude.
[18646.78s -> 18653.51s]  You already had the wind. You froze him and then just kicked his dead, lifeless body into the
[18653.51s -> 18665.93s]  water. That was terrible. What are you looking at? Whoops. I'm going to get him right in the head.
[18667.64s -> 18702.62s]  No. Fuck. How much higher? Of course. We want yellow to win, but looks a little hairy right now.
[18703.34s -> 18740.74s]  Oh, maybe. Okay. We need a crown too. Yeah. Let's get this. Let's get this party going.
[18740.74s -> 18748.73s]  I'm underneath this and I can't get up. What the fuck? Am I underneath the boat?
[18755.18s -> 18795.64s]  Oh, that rocket's coming out. Blast him. This is going to be so scary for this guy.
[18808.34s -> 18836.76s]  Nice try. Fuck that. You thought you could get rid of me? Not yet. That's not fair. They shouldn't
[18836.76s -> 18842.70s]  be able to throw things from the stands. You shouldn't be able to throw things from the
[18842.70s -> 18873.77s]  stands. That's just not... That's very dangerous. I just hit with the ground. Oh, all right. I went
[18873.77s -> 18881.59s]  for the punch. Is there a reason why I was just electrocuted for a hundred million years?
[18882.15s -> 18909.11s]  Why me? Why me? Anybody else? Leave me alone. Somebody help me. Oh,
[18910.07s -> 18915.62s]  now the tables have turned. Looks like you're in a little bit of a pickle, aren't you?
[18916.50s -> 18943.93s]  Be careful down there. Oh, you're alive I see. Hello, Captain. I thought I was friendly.
[18944.57s -> 18952.92s]  I was not. It always happens like this. And then someone's going to drop a brick on my head and
[18952.92s -> 18965.72s]  they're going to throw me overboard. This gorilla... Yeah, see? Somebody stop him. Stop him.
[18965.72s -> 18975.99s]  Gorilla, help me. It's 2v2 with one on each team. 2v2. That's fine. I'll just climb to the top.
[18982.63s -> 19030.09s]  Ow. Let go. I should have won that. This didn't have enough health. Watch out. Why am I not
[19030.09s -> 19049.00s]  swinging it? Damn it. You want to put me in the fucking juice machine, huh? You want to put me
[19049.00s -> 19056.01s]  in the juicer? I think you're gonna put me in the fucking meat grinder, don't you? Well, now we're
[19056.01s -> 19082.44s]  both dead. I hope you're happy. I gotta go. Oh my god. That was the strongest headbutt I have ever
[19082.44s -> 19095.54s]  seen. That was... I just got sent to outer space. You can definitely get there. Are you kidding me?
[19096.34s -> 19133.42s]  Sitting there. I'm holding Y and right trigger and this won't do it. I have to try. Too much lasagna?
[19134.38s -> 19151.96s]  That was a crazy headbutt. Is it green? It wasn't blue. All right, one more. I want to do one more.
[19151.96s -> 19188.71s]  Actually, one more. I mean it. I just went out really badly. Rude. Rude. Still looked the coolest
[19188.71s -> 19200.49s]  though. There's some pretty cool cats here. This game seems rage-inducing. You would think so,
[19200.49s -> 19217.40s]  but everything is so goofily presented that you can't be. Please play as Melon Dog. I don't think
[19217.40s -> 19253.08s]  I can. Don't pull the brake this time. Yeah, I'll try. I'll be Melon Dog. Should I actually
[19253.08s -> 19272.34s]  try winning this time? It's not about winning. It's about... Whoa. Is that a moose? That's cool.
[19272.34s -> 19285.83s]  What an insane animal a moose is. Sometimes you forget just how unbelievably massive a moose
[19285.83s -> 19298.41s]  really is. They're like elephants. They're gigantic. They're such a majestic... Are those antlers too?
[19322.42s -> 19325.54s]  What? Was it the sign? Did I get hit in the face by the sign?
[19326.41s -> 19347.56s]  Oh. All right. I'm gonna go fuck with the other team. It's just like looking into the abyss.
[19348.54s -> 19363.50s]  I have... I just... I need to go over here. All right. Well, they let me help them. Let's see.
[19370.31s -> 19391.40s]  Stop. I'm on your team. Holy shit. It's a mess over here. I want to play too. Actually, you know,
[19391.40s -> 19408.98s]  while that's happening, let's load this shit up. Forget about this. All right. Forget about the
[19409.78s -> 19419.86s]  moose. Just put the coal in. He's doing it on purpose to mess with us. It's such a great strategy
[19420.42s -> 19425.90s]  because it's just like I have to get this moose. He's just... We have to kill him. And then you
[19425.90s -> 19438.66s]  can just get distracted the whole time. All right. Somebody kill the moose. No. No. Get me out of the
[19438.66s -> 19481.78s]  fire. Whoa. Easy. I think we can still do it. Okay. I've had just about enough of this. Get out of
[19481.78s -> 19516.04s]  here. Hey. Okay. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.
[19516.04s -> 19522.14s]  I think we're going to lose. It wasn't my fault though. I just jumped off the edge like five
[19522.14s -> 19535.62s]  times accidentally and then accidentally killed the teammate and a little bros running around
[19535.62s -> 19541.27s]  here with a tennis racket right now. He's no regard for anything. He's just hitting every...
[19541.27s -> 19545.99s]  It doesn't matter who it... He doesn't care what letters or colors or... He's just hitting
[19545.99s -> 19564.94s]  everybody it doesn't matter who it is this this gator needs to be stopped immediately he still
[19564.94s -> 19580.49s]  has it somebody stop him stop this fucking gator you're watching too much tiktok i don't have i
[19580.49s -> 19592.66s]  don't have tiktok guys i'm not even signed into youtube i watch youtube shorts until i fuck up
[19592.66s -> 19598.90s]  my entire algorithm to to the point where it's just just wacky wacko shit and then i have to
[19598.90s -> 19604.74s]  clear all my search history and all my fucking browser history on it so i reset the algorithm
[19604.74s -> 19614.54s]  again and then it gets all fucked up again in like 20 minutes yeah and it's even worse when
[19614.54s -> 19624.30s]  you reset the algorithm it's even worse for like 10 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes and then you go
[19624.30s -> 19628.86s]  through one of these youtube shorts it's just like oh shit this was like a fucking goofy one
[19629.58s -> 19635.10s]  and i could have just skipped it but i was on it from the whole time i watched the whole thing
[19635.10s -> 19645.24s]  so now i fucked up the algorithm again one too many roll the glass down the stairs videos and
[19645.24s -> 19653.32s]  it's just like oh i want to see what happens and it's like oh shit ah damn it now i gotta go clear
[19653.32s -> 19665.80s]  the watch history again and i watch him every time i watch him the whole way through i don't watch
[19665.80s -> 19673.91s]  very much youtube shorts though i feel like they literally burn a hole in your brain i i i seriously
[19688.95s -> 19696.02s]  all right now that was supposed to be the last one oh wait and i want to do a sports one they're
[19696.02s -> 19707.99s]  fun wait is this football or soccer yeah no i i gotta go i want to eat something it's been a
[19707.99s -> 19718.71s]  little while since i've had some food is it bad is it bm if i leave now that's all bots anyways
[19718.71s -> 19760.46s]  you get um if you leave it's bm you have to play okay fine let's make this quick all right we got
[19760.46s -> 19784.34s]  we have the advantage here i'm not gonna let otter take the ball from us are we get it downfield
[19784.98s -> 19802.63s]  how did i not grab it what am i doing why would he oh my stamina bar is low and somehow i managed
[19802.63s -> 19829.88s]  to get out with that they were just pulling me in two different directions that was good
[19829.88s -> 19866.12s]  all right get it downfield down down down down no okay good it's all right i'm gonna rip his head
[19872.79s -> 19898.82s]  that's a lot of people all holding the ball like help me get that shit out of here now this is
[19898.90s -> 19912.10s]  interesting um i don't think the ball is technically on the ground or i don't know
[19912.10s -> 19928.90s]  where it is all right if we actually score after that that's gonna be awesome come on we can do it
[19928.90s -> 19938.02s]  that's so clutch if we do get it bunny oh so clutch get it in there you didn't think i was
[19938.02s -> 19941.22s]  ready for that you didn't think i was ready to catch you didn't think i was ready to catch that
[19941.22s -> 19946.02s]  is that what you thought did you think that oh no get it funny right there come on get it in there
[19946.74s -> 19967.43s]  that's a huge that's a huge deal that's one for the history books for sure how come that didn't
[19967.43s -> 19972.65s]  count before i think because the ball was on top of so many people that it technically was like out
[19972.65s -> 19994.98s]  of bounds that's my best guess oh they're pissed off now all right yeah they are not happy about
[19994.98s -> 20013.00s]  that stay back here right through his head no we can't just let him run away with it like this
[20033.43s -> 20069.94s]  yeah yep yep yep yep yeah let's go but one more two more uh that's gonna be a goal all right well
[20070.50s -> 20101.48s]  the game now and that is big so is this if i stop you big run it in yeah nice i like this one way
[20101.48s -> 20123.13s]  more than the soccer one or the hockey one all right we're all here we're all here just let
[20123.13s -> 20149.30s]  let somebody let somebody grab it everybody wants to be the hero of the game i'm running the stamina
[20149.30s -> 20159.38s]  somebody grab it we could win it right here there you go wow the juke that was unbelievable
[20163.08s -> 20172.87s]  he went a little too far over his head i just he knows he's coming wow that was well played
[20172.87s -> 20177.96s]  on both of them that was a great play for both of them it just one of them did it a little better
[20192.04s -> 20218.82s]  oh no stamina good exactly what you should have done yeah oh yes it's all right good good good
[20218.82s -> 20236.14s]  good grab it grab it shit they're gonna tie it up no they're not okay three what four to two
[20236.14s -> 20258.10s]  four three just a little bit chance oh we should be all right do not let him run away with it like

[20355.22s -> 20369.48s]  about very soon a couple of fun things uh grotto beach tts is very very close very close i'd expect
[20369.48s -> 20375.40s]  you'll see a lot more on that very very soon and that's just going to kind of live as long as people
[20375.40s -> 20384.26s]  want to play it and then there's something else fun i'm going to be doing something it'd be
[20384.26s -> 20397.27s]  interesting i got to figure out a lot of stuff here in the next like three months we're going
[20397.27s -> 20403.98s]  to do sorcery on monday uh i want to do the resident evil 4 dlc so we'll do that that if
[20403.98s -> 20418.23s]  that takes three or four hours maybe but that's the plan for monday i hope you start making youtube
[20418.23s -> 20427.14s]  shorts i want to do a youtube short where i just have a podcast microphone in front of me it's like
[20427.14s -> 20432.60s]  a podcast room and i'm just talking to somebody who also has like a podcast mic in front of them
[20432.60s -> 20450.12s]  as if this is like episode 400 i find that to be kind of funny just upload a shitload of them
[20457.45s -> 20467.38s]  i've seen people do that that's funny i don't have very i really don't have any plans for youtube
[20467.38s -> 20476.54s]  shorts maybe i remember talking to stir about how interesting the concept was and he's talked
[20476.54s -> 20488.39s]  about it a lot too but a youtube short for me i would want it to be i there's two kind of schools
[20488.39s -> 20494.07s]  of thought it's like highlight interesting things that happen on a stream but also or that's
[20494.07s -> 20504.76s]  something that's happened in a video but also a completely just original 30 second short video
[20504.76s -> 20509.46s]  then i feel like you go kind of down the rabbit hole with that and i don't know exactly how much
[20509.46s -> 20516.23s]  time i want to put into something like youtube shorts not really much time at all if i'm honest
[20516.23s -> 20532.97s]  turn this off yeah thanks for hanging out thanks for watching i didn't i think a couple of raids
[20532.97s -> 20541.26s]  came in looks like i missed them i'll get in a more comfortable setup though this is step one of
[20541.26s -> 20551.75s]  three stages to be able to kind of not be sitting so upright when i stream and i feel pretty good i
[20551.75s -> 20557.67s]  feel okay usually after about six hours i kind of start to lock up a little and feel like but
[20557.67s -> 20569.22s]  i felt pretty good today so are you laying down well i'm not that was a joke i'm sitting up but
[20569.22s -> 20576.65s]  i'm just sitting back into a more comfortable kind of pillowy chair and it is on the ground
[20577.45s -> 20592.70s]  i have stuff underneath me too on the ground it's comfortable i like it yeah i'll see you guys on
[20592.70s -> 20600.57s]  monday i'll be around like let's just say five pacific that makes sense do another kind of later
