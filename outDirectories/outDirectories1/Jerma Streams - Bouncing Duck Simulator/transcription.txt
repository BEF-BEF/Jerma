[0.66s -> 1.16s]  How's it going?
[3.11s -> 3.61s]  What's up?
[18.30s -> 21.70s]  Today, we're going to play Bouncing Duck Simulator.
[23.16s -> 26.94s]  Those of you that watched the Team Fortress 2 Man vs.
[26.94s -> 34.98s]  Machine stream, you would know that Poke gave us a pretty, pretty good
[34.98s -> 36.32s]  recommendation to play this game.
[38.44s -> 39.22s]  So we'll find out.
[40.27s -> 45.55s]  I, I do trust Poke's game recommendations, plays a lot of interesting stuff.
[46.53s -> 48.47s]  So here we go.
[51.04s -> 52.90s]  It looks kind of, it looks kind of good.
[58.54s -> 59.66s]  It looks pretty good.
[60.81s -> 62.17s]  I feel like I'm going to have fun with this for a little while.
[70.86s -> 71.78s]  I thought you retired.
[72.50s -> 80.21s]  I mean, yeah, it doesn't mean I'm not going to, I'm going to stream when I feel
[80.21s -> 84.33s]  like it and make YouTube videos still and work it off brand and check in.
[85.37s -> 85.97s]  Yeah, what's up?
[85.97s -> 86.47s]  I'm here.
[86.89s -> 87.39s]  I'm right here.
[88.82s -> 89.32s]  I'm right here.
[89.70s -> 90.20s]  I'm still here.
[95.78s -> 96.98s]  He's a YouTuber now.
[105.27s -> 106.67s]  I can still hear him.
[106.71s -> 107.01s]  Yeah.
[107.01s -> 108.51s]  Cause I'm live right now.
[108.51s -> 111.43s]  About to play Bouncing Duck Simulator.
[113.24s -> 113.52s]  All right.
[113.56s -> 114.06s]  You guys ready?
[115.78s -> 116.02s]  I don't know.
[116.02s -> 117.46s]  The stream might not, might not be too long.
[117.46s -> 122.67s]  I know Armored Core 6 is the elephant in the room, but we'll see.
[123.11s -> 124.39s]  I did say I wanted to play this too.
[125.79s -> 128.47s]  Maybe I'll try Armored Core 6 on my own.
[128.47s -> 129.63s]  Maybe I'll stream it.
[129.67s -> 130.75s]  Maybe I won't.
[130.95s -> 132.47s]  Maybe we'll play Sorcery.
[132.91s -> 140.91s]  I don't know, but let's go.
[145.18s -> 145.68s]  You guys ready?
[146.30s -> 149.10s]  This song, by the way, has been stuck in my head since I was sitting here.
[151.75s -> 152.15s]  Listen to that.
[152.15s -> 152.79s]  Ready for the song?
[153.43s -> 153.83s]  Not the one.
[153.83s -> 155.51s]  I mean, this one's a, this is a banger too, but hold on.
[155.51s -> 156.01s]  Listen to this one.
[156.39s -> 162.16s]  This one has just been burning in my brain for a full, I want to say 20, 30
[162.16s -> 163.48s]  minutes of hanging out and getting ready.
[165.28s -> 166.12s]  You guys ready to hear this?
[176.19s -> 177.47s]  This is what I've been setting up to.
[181.41s -> 182.89s]  It's a, it, this thing's great.
[182.89s -> 183.45s]  It's great.
[191.46s -> 196.18s]  I can't, I, yeah, this is the game that poke mentioned.
[196.18s -> 196.68s]  Yeah.
[201.94s -> 205.22s]  I got to like DM poke and be like, Hey, I got to give him a review after this.
[206.13s -> 207.37s]  I will give him a full review.
[209.71s -> 214.14s]  That full review is going to be one sentence, but all right.
[214.14s -> 214.62s]  You guys ready?
[214.62s -> 215.12s]  Let's just play.
[215.12s -> 215.62s]  Let's hang out.
[217.94s -> 219.74s]  Make it louder, louder, louder, louder.
[221.61s -> 223.01s]  Um, it's kind of, it's all right.
[223.17s -> 224.05s]  That's good enough right here.
[224.53s -> 225.69s]  I don't know how loud the rest of the game is.
[225.69s -> 226.19s]  So not yet.
[227.39s -> 227.67s]  All right.
[227.67s -> 228.87s]  Bouncing duck simulator.
[228.87s -> 230.15s]  Start new game.
[237.58s -> 239.10s]  Stir would hate this game.
[242.14s -> 242.74s]  Oh, that's right.
[242.74s -> 243.02s]  Yes.
[243.02s -> 244.46s]  Durr would hate this.
[248.91s -> 249.27s]  All right.
[249.27s -> 251.99s]  So we woke up, we're in a, we're in a room.
[254.02s -> 254.26s]  Okay.
[254.30s -> 257.06s]  This mouse sensitivity is very high.
[257.06s -> 257.58s]  Hold on.
[260.27s -> 261.67s]  Uh, give me one sec.
[261.83s -> 263.43s]  How do I turn the mouse sensitivity down?
[264.10s -> 264.54s]  I do.
[264.58s -> 264.90s]  Okay.
[264.94s -> 266.66s]  Wait, can I do it through here?
[270.34s -> 272.26s]  How do I change the DPI of my mouse?
[272.94s -> 273.90s]  Does anybody know?
[277.43s -> 280.51s]  How do I affect the DPI of my mouse?
[285.62s -> 286.78s]  You're a grown ass man.
[286.82s -> 287.32s]  Yeah.
[289.46s -> 293.02s]  Wait, do I have to open up my like razor program?
[293.66s -> 294.16s]  Okay.
[294.16s -> 294.66s]  Razor.
[296.56s -> 300.24s]  This is the thing that I force quit every single time it opens, but I'm opening it
[300.24s -> 300.92s]  for real now.
[303.78s -> 303.98s]  Okay.
[303.98s -> 304.48s]  Here it is.
[305.02s -> 305.54s]  Okay.
[306.56s -> 308.60s]  Uh, I don't have performance.
[311.47s -> 311.87s]  Okay.
[311.87s -> 312.63s]  Sensitivity.
[312.63s -> 314.19s]  The number of dots per inch.
[314.81s -> 317.98s]  It's currently at, I'm going to put it at 800.
[318.30s -> 318.94s]  See if that helps.
[320.72s -> 321.24s]  Holy shit.
[321.24s -> 321.96s]  This sucks.
[323.03s -> 323.79s]  How's it in here though?
[326.73s -> 328.25s]  Ooh, that's actually much better.
[328.45s -> 329.37s]  It has to be even lower.
[329.37s -> 332.99s]  Hold on.
[333.17s -> 333.73s]  Even lower.
[333.73s -> 336.05s]  Like one, like 600 probably.
[338.06s -> 338.58s]  Oh my God.
[338.58s -> 339.18s]  This is awful.
[342.28s -> 342.48s]  All right.
[342.48s -> 342.98s]  There we go.
[343.12s -> 343.92s]  I think that's okay.
[344.68s -> 346.08s]  I might have to lower it a little more later.
[346.67s -> 347.79s]  Why did I turn it off?
[354.24s -> 354.74s]  Okay.
[355.99s -> 357.07s]  That's much better.
[357.11s -> 358.31s]  Like a million times, but okay.
[358.31s -> 359.39s]  13, five, six.
[359.39s -> 359.89s]  What does this mean?
[359.91s -> 360.41s]  Zero.
[360.47s -> 360.97s]  What's up?
[363.20s -> 364.72s]  Okay. That's turning music on and off.
[367.59s -> 368.63s]  I mean, we're going to keep the music on.
[370.36s -> 371.00s]  Is there a sprint?
[376.32s -> 376.82s]  What do I get?
[376.84s -> 377.52s]  What do I get a duck?
[383.48s -> 384.20s]  Oh, wait, we're here.
[387.24s -> 389.96s]  Poke is worried that you're going to hate this and be mad at him.
[393.20s -> 393.72s]  That was okay.
[393.72s -> 394.64s]  This is loud.
[394.96s -> 396.16s]  I'm, I'm turning it down.
[399.31s -> 400.19s]  Oh, poke, poke.
[400.19s -> 402.91s]  Our friendship relies on me enjoying this game.
[402.99s -> 403.49s]  Uh oh.
[406.41s -> 407.49s]  He's nervous.
[407.61s -> 408.53s]  I'm going to love it.
[408.73s -> 411.05s]  It's a game where you, you don't have that to play.
[411.95s -> 413.35s]  I love these kinds of games.
[414.83s -> 418.71s]  Poke. One of my favorite games of all time is a game where you clean houses and
[418.91s -> 421.15s]  like hit walls with a fucking sledgehammer.
[421.81s -> 422.85s]  I, we're going to, it's going to be fine.
[427.40s -> 428.28s]  I just got 10 bounces.
[428.56s -> 429.28s]  That's gotta be a record.
[432.64s -> 435.68s]  Okay. So a whole left click and then left go to throw it.
[439.32s -> 440.32s]  Okay. What does right click do?
[443.60s -> 444.32s]  I'm going to do the thing.
[444.72s -> 446.08s]  I'm going to take my bouncy ball.
[446.08s -> 451.41s]  I'm going to run, sprint, hop, hop, hop, jump at the ground as hard as I can.
[453.30s -> 453.98s]  It didn't really work.
[457.57s -> 458.57s]  Can I spawn more than one?
[463.06s -> 463.56s]  No.
[464.13s -> 465.37s]  I only have 27 bounces.
[465.37s -> 469.54s]  What, how do I get more into the corner?
[474.94s -> 477.26s]  I probably get, if I get to a hundred, I bet it changes.
[488.96s -> 490.60s]  I kind of feel like a dog right now, but that's all right.
[498.22s -> 500.14s]  What happens when I get to a hundred?
[506.50s -> 507.14s]  99. All right.
[507.14s -> 508.38s]  This is it. 100.
[510.22s -> 510.72s]  I just got it.
[513.02s -> 513.50s]  Oh shit.
[513.50s -> 515.50s]  All right. So now I can press this button.
[519.45s -> 521.85s]  I have two, I have two ducks in here now.
[523.22s -> 523.72s]  What is this?
[525.36s -> 525.86s]  Health?
[527.18s -> 527.82s]  What do I do with that?
[535.80s -> 537.24s]  Can I feed it to the duck or something?
[540.62s -> 541.54s]  Whoa. Okay.
[541.54s -> 542.04s]  It's bigger.
[546.31s -> 547.91s]  Does this count for more bounces?
[549.02s -> 549.74s]  It was a battery.
[549.78s -> 550.42s]  All right. Well, all right.
[550.42s -> 551.06s]  I get it. I get it.
[551.06s -> 552.30s]  I know. I get the game now.
[557.86s -> 559.02s]  Poke. Don't ever call me ever again.
[559.46s -> 559.96s]  I'm just kidding.
[569.46s -> 571.46s]  I think I actually, I'm going to really like this.
[571.50s -> 572.30s]  I get it.
[574.30s -> 575.86s]  I get what's going on right now.
[576.46s -> 577.10s]  I'm into this.
[581.74s -> 582.34s]  I got to get to two.
[582.34s -> 583.10s]  What? 500?
[585.75s -> 592.14s]  I'm going, I think going in the corner corner, we'll get at least three or four.
[592.14s -> 592.46s]  Right?
[592.50s -> 593.98s]  If we stuff it in here and get it glitched.
[597.84s -> 598.60s]  That's a good strategy.
[598.80s -> 599.76s]  500. I'm going 500.
[604.68s -> 605.18s]  Shit.
[605.32s -> 606.04s]  Whoa. I got more.
[609.50s -> 610.50s]  Can I pick up more than one?
[614.22s -> 615.68s]  These things are worth two.
[616.08s -> 616.58s]  Watch this.
[616.88s -> 617.64s]  Can I pick up more than one?
[627.57s -> 628.07s]  Okay.
[629.04s -> 630.84s]  I love how this game was recommended for me.
[632.08s -> 632.58s]  Hey man.
[632.88s -> 635.20s]  I got a great game that I think you'll really like.
[635.70s -> 636.38s]  Oh, what is it?
[637.10s -> 637.98s]  Baldur's Gate 3.
[638.68s -> 639.36s]  Strategy.
[640.02s -> 641.06s]  RPG elements.
[641.88s -> 643.08s]  There's a lot of decision-making.
[644.20s -> 644.70s]  Not that one.
[645.73s -> 646.73s]  Armored Core 6.
[647.01s -> 647.97s]  Action-oriented.
[648.41s -> 654.45s]  Tons of difficult boss encounters and tons of upgrades to put in your character and make a mech that you can fight with.
[655.29s -> 655.93s]  Not that one either.
[657.05s -> 660.13s]  Dude, I think you'd be a huge fan of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.
[660.41s -> 664.77s]  You can explore a vast, incredibly large open world.
[665.13s -> 667.09s]  And create any- No, not that one either.
[668.86s -> 670.46s]  I'd like to have you play with toys.
[671.85s -> 672.69s]  Now that one.
[672.81s -> 674.45s]  That's the one for you.
[679.76s -> 682.08s]  I'm just chasing around dog toys.
[685.01s -> 686.53s]  Is this what Otto feels like?
[691.26s -> 692.66s]  He's got Otto brain.
[693.34s -> 694.06s]  Oh, I got another one.
[694.14s -> 694.64s]  Oh, look.
[694.74s -> 695.62s]  Another thing to press.
[698.26s -> 698.76s]  Yes.
[699.73s -> 700.23s]  What is it?
[702.01s -> 702.93s]  All right. This is a big deal.
[704.12s -> 708.56s]  Do I give the battery to the pink one or to the yellow one?
[714.07s -> 716.79s]  Should we keep them the same size or?
[719.46s -> 720.18s]  I'm going for that.
[721.33s -> 722.17s]  To me, that was the right.
[724.77s -> 728.19s]  All right. What about like, wait, I can't pick it up anymore.
[729.46s -> 730.18s]  Why can I not pick it up?
[733.59s -> 734.09s]  How much is it?
[734.11s -> 735.03s]  Wait, I can't pick it up.
[736.68s -> 743.70s]  Oh, that's worth 10 now.
[743.70s -> 744.20s]  I think.
[744.89s -> 745.49s]  All right. I got it.
[746.93s -> 747.81s]  Just keep throwing shit at it.
[754.70s -> 755.38s]  You ruined it.
[755.38s -> 756.10s]  You need to restart.
[757.86s -> 758.36s]  No, I'm good.
[759.14s -> 759.64s]  I'll be okay.
[765.91s -> 766.51s]  Nice. Okay.
[766.51s -> 767.19s]  Thousand.
[772.92s -> 773.60s]  That one's different.
[775.34s -> 777.18s]  Okay. This one is permanently bouncing.
[779.31s -> 779.83s]  We're going to have to.
[779.83s -> 781.91s]  Okay. When we get the next level up, we're giving it to that one.
[784.37s -> 789.29s]  Also, by the way, I do apologize for anybody that does have a dog in the room and you're listening to this with a speaker.
[791.90s -> 792.74s]  Honestly, I can't.
[792.74s -> 793.82s]  There's not much I can do about it.
[794.02s -> 803.58s]  It's either that or turn off the volume, but I'm probably making a lot of your dogs head tilt at your computer right now.
[804.22s -> 805.42s]  And I, for that, I apologize.
[808.51s -> 809.51s]  All right. We got more.
[810.71s -> 811.59s]  Almost at 1500.
[813.15s -> 813.67s]  This one's different.
[813.67s -> 814.35s]  This one's like glass.
[815.18s -> 815.68s]  What is this one?
[817.84s -> 818.60s]  Can I break this one?
[818.60s -> 819.32s]  I'm scared to break it.
[821.47s -> 822.51s]  This is worth a hundred.
[822.95s -> 823.63s]  How much is that worth?
[825.27s -> 825.77s]  Okay, dude.
[826.23s -> 835.31s]  Oh, oh, I don't know if I did that wrong, but whatever.
[838.73s -> 842.33s]  All right. We have to focus on bouncing the big one with the little one.
[842.45s -> 845.21s]  That one's just a permanent stat increases.
[845.21s -> 848.06s]  So I'm gonna play this for at least a couple hours.
[848.10s -> 849.86s]  Like, that's what's happening today.
[854.09s -> 854.59s]  Ow!
[859.80s -> 861.32s]  Is this a pre-recorded stream?
[861.32s -> 861.82s]  No.
[863.66s -> 864.54s]  Wait, I can press the button.
[868.10s -> 868.62s]  All right. All right.
[868.62s -> 870.54s]  All right. This is, this is really important.
[870.58s -> 875.17s]  I'm going to give this to you because I want you to get, that's the right call, right?
[877.98s -> 880.82s]  Min maxing this, you would give them all to this eventually.
[881.18s -> 881.68s]  All right, here we go.
[883.65s -> 884.17s]  What's that giving me?
[886.54s -> 887.46s]  That's 20 each one.
[888.29s -> 889.17s]  All right. Keep that one moving.
[889.61s -> 890.93s]  Can I trap that in a corner or something?
[902.30s -> 904.06s]  Is he going to play this for 52 hours?
[904.74s -> 905.38s]  Not that long.
[907.60s -> 910.60s]  I do want to get to at least a million bounces.
[910.92s -> 911.80s]  Is that going to take a long time?
[914.18s -> 915.62s]  Is that going to take like more than two hours?
[921.25s -> 921.75s]  More.
[922.40s -> 922.90s]  More!
[925.79s -> 927.19s]  Okay. That one, all this one's metal.
[930.61s -> 931.49s]  I wonder if this one breaks.
[934.39s -> 935.07s]  Is that worth anything?
[939.92s -> 940.42s]  I can't tell.
[940.52s -> 941.28s]  That's not very much.
[944.42s -> 946.06s]  Maybe, I guess it moves more?
[947.72s -> 948.22s]  Heavier?
[959.37s -> 959.87s]  Nice.
[963.31s -> 964.35s]  I'm definitely gonna get to a million.
[964.35s -> 964.85s]  Easy.
[968.22s -> 971.58s]  I have so much training playing any video game on the iPad.
[972.87s -> 973.91s]  I'm going to be really good at this.
[979.94s -> 982.58s]  It kind of sounds like they're like yelling at each other or something.
[982.78s -> 994.84s]  He's an iPad baby.
[995.04s -> 996.20s]  I'm already at 10,000.
[996.20s -> 997.32s]  You don't think I'm going to get to a million?
[1002.49s -> 1003.21s]  All right. What do I up?
[1003.25s -> 1004.49s]  I'm going to upgrade this one again.
[1005.05s -> 1006.25s]  It's just too consistent.
[1013.66s -> 1014.42s]  I mean, the game is corrupt.
[1020.42s -> 1022.26s]  Is that going to keep, is that going to keep going the whole time?
[1026.69s -> 1028.53s]  That's not going to stay there the whole time, right?
[1029.86s -> 1033.54s]  Because I don't think I can sit in this room for two, more than an hour,
[1033.82s -> 1034.78s]  listening to this on loop.
[1048.11s -> 1049.15s]  Well, this one's magical.
[1051.06s -> 1051.56s]  What if I do this?
[1052.34s -> 1052.84s]  Shit.
[1061.12s -> 1061.62s]  All right.
[1062.98s -> 1065.70s]  I might have to put my own music on.
[1066.26s -> 1067.10s]  I'm going to have to put my own.
[1067.98s -> 1069.86s]  All right. At what point have I won listening to this?
[1071.06s -> 1072.42s]  Does anybody, anybody want to tell me?
[1072.42s -> 1073.42s]  At what point have I won?
[1076.55s -> 1077.15s]  30 minutes?
[1079.84s -> 1080.76s]  What if I just do it again?
[1085.00s -> 1085.50s]  Get over here.
[1090.18s -> 1095.32s]  Oh, get the fuck over here.
[1105.83s -> 1109.71s]  You're doing, you're doing like what every cartoon character in every single
[1109.71s -> 1111.51s]  piece of media does when they have sugar.
[1118.68s -> 1120.32s]  I don't, I don't think I can, I can't pick it up.
[1128.72s -> 1129.22s]  All right.
[1129.22s -> 1130.84s]  Where's the, where is it?
[1133.96s -> 1134.92s]  No, I lost it.
[1136.08s -> 1137.00s]  Oh my God.
[1150.59s -> 1151.09s]  Shit.
[1152.33s -> 1152.85s]  All right. All right.
[1152.85s -> 1153.29s]  All right. Right.
[1153.29s -> 1154.41s]  Right. I have to just yield it.
[1156.43s -> 1157.19s]  I'm giving it to this one.
[1169.98s -> 1174.30s]  If I knew that I was going to do nonstop Nyan cat, we would not be in this
[1174.30s -> 1176.30s]  scenario right now, but here we are.
[1189.63s -> 1191.43s]  If what, what 50 K is going to give me something good.
[1191.43s -> 1191.93s]  Probably. Right.
[1194.15s -> 1194.95s]  Should I break this?
[1201.88s -> 1202.60s]  All right. 50 K.
[1207.34s -> 1208.02s]  What's this one?
[1209.16s -> 1210.08s]  This one's just a regular one.
[1217.51s -> 1218.07s]  It's a blue one.
[1218.07s -> 1218.57s]  Yeah.
[1219.88s -> 1221.76s]  This thing is somehow not hitting anything in the room.
[1225.95s -> 1226.95s]  What is this giving for points?
[1227.35s -> 1227.99s]  Like 80.
[1231.06s -> 1233.14s]  All right. We got to actually start to use skill here.
[1235.41s -> 1236.81s]  This feels like an experiment.
[1238.83s -> 1239.87s]  A hundred K is going to get something good.
[1239.87s -> 1240.37s]  Right?
[1249.12s -> 1250.04s]  What's pokes high score.
[1254.51s -> 1254.83s]  I should wait.
[1254.83s -> 1255.19s]  Don't tell me.
[1255.19s -> 1255.55s]  Don't tell me.
[1255.55s -> 1255.91s]  Don't tell me.
[1255.91s -> 1256.41s]  Nobody tell me.
[1256.59s -> 1257.11s]  Nobody tell me.
[1257.15s -> 1260.67s]  Uh, clear chat, mods, clear chat, mods, clear chat, mods, clear chat,
[1261.59s -> 1262.35s]  mods, clear chat.
[1262.95s -> 1263.45s]  Nobody tell me.
[1266.44s -> 1268.72s]  I have to, I have to beat pokes, uh, score, whatever it is.
[1281.68s -> 1282.32s]  72.
[1282.36s -> 1283.00s]  I got to get to a hundred K.
[1290.77s -> 1292.29s]  I have to turn this off at some point.
[1292.93s -> 1294.93s]  I personally can't take this.
[1296.72s -> 1298.28s]  I personally don't think I could take this.
[1298.72s -> 1300.96s]  This not the game, this song.
[1302.51s -> 1304.55s]  Look, it's a classic classic song.
[1305.96s -> 1313.96s]  Wait, that's another power up.
[1314.60s -> 1314.80s]  All right.
[1314.80s -> 1316.40s]  Can I please feed it to you?
[1317.75s -> 1318.71s]  Do you turn into something else?
[1324.20s -> 1324.44s]  Come here.
[1324.44s -> 1324.60s]  Come here.
[1324.60s -> 1324.84s]  Come here.
[1332.35s -> 1333.11s]  I'm just gonna stand still.
[1333.15s -> 1333.83s]  It'll hit me eventually.
[1340.50s -> 1341.98s]  It's given a lot of points though.
[1342.46s -> 1342.90s]  Right here.
[1343.18s -> 1347.32s]  Stupid.
[1360.51s -> 1361.63s]  I can't track it.
[1364.13s -> 1365.09s]  Just give it to the crystal.
[1366.44s -> 1367.16s]  Oh, I can't.
[1368.72s -> 1370.76s]  Um, who should I give it to?
[1372.88s -> 1373.80s]  Is this it fully upgraded?
[1373.80s -> 1374.76s]  What about the King?
[1375.62s -> 1375.90s]  No.
[1376.46s -> 1377.46s]  Uh, what about blue?
[1381.86s -> 1382.30s]  No.
[1382.74s -> 1383.54s]  Who can I give this to?
[1387.44s -> 1387.92s]  Whoa.
[1389.72s -> 1390.84s]  Somebody just to throw pink.
[1390.88s -> 1392.76s]  Oh, guys make one.
[1392.88s -> 1393.68s]  Hold on a second.
[1393.72s -> 1394.40s]  I just made.
[1396.85s -> 1398.29s]  Oh dear God.
[1399.27s -> 1400.19s]  Oh dear God.
[1409.06s -> 1418.04s]  Uh, where's wait, I need both of you over here in the corner.
[1418.56s -> 1419.24s]  No shit.
[1419.32s -> 1419.64s]  Come here.
[1422.42s -> 1427.87s]  Can I crouch a hundred thousand bounces?
[1427.87s -> 1428.23s]  Let's go.
[1431.56s -> 1431.88s]  Okay.
[1433.66s -> 1434.34s]  How much is this one worth?
[1434.94s -> 1435.70s]  That's a lot.
[1435.70s -> 1444.36s]  I think this, ah, it's a bomb.
[1444.40s -> 1444.80s]  It's a bomb.
[1444.80s -> 1445.24s]  That's a bomb.
[1445.24s -> 1445.56s]  It's a bomb.
[1445.56s -> 1445.88s]  It's a bomb.
[1445.88s -> 1446.20s]  It's a bomb.
[1446.68s -> 1447.24s]  Just leave it over there.
[1452.34s -> 1454.18s]  I want to shut that off so bad.
[1462.52s -> 1464.00s]  I used to, how do I upgrade?
[1464.98s -> 1466.14s]  Who wants to upgrade?
[1466.18s -> 1466.78s]  What about you?
[1472.82s -> 1473.46s]  Get over here.
[1475.08s -> 1476.20s]  Why can't I upgrade anybody?
[1478.54s -> 1479.14s]  Oh shit.
[1479.14s -> 1479.90s]  That turned gold.
[1493.03s -> 1494.15s]  Should I blow one of these up?
[1495.56s -> 1496.20s]  I'm afraid of this.
[1505.26s -> 1506.06s]  I, we need to make more.
[1517.18s -> 1517.94s]  This is so loud.
[1517.94s -> 1518.86s]  I'm so glad I turned it down.
[1523.00s -> 1527.13s]  I think it's all about making, um, I think I honestly, I think it's all about putting
[1527.13s -> 1529.49s]  on the plock OST in five minutes.
[1530.30s -> 1530.74s]  You know what I mean?
[1540.04s -> 1540.80s]  I'm into this though.
[1540.96s -> 1544.19s]  I I'm definitely into, uh, I want to keep this going.
[1544.19s -> 1545.19s]  I want to get, I gotta get to a million.
[1547.25s -> 1550.61s]  If you're going to open this game, you'd better get to a million points.
[1551.05s -> 1552.21s]  Otherwise, why did you open it?
[1553.23s -> 1554.27s]  Why did you open the game?
[1554.27s -> 1554.55s]  Right?
[1555.03s -> 1555.63s]  I think that's fair.
[1562.57s -> 1567.72s]  Each one of these bounces from the baby is given, uh, at least one.
[1573.77s -> 1574.33s]  He's in the way.
[1574.37s -> 1574.89s]  Let me move him.
[1587.49s -> 1589.01s]  I hate when it flies by my head.
[1589.65s -> 1591.87s]  It's like somebody's zooming by me.
[1594.34s -> 1598.46s]  It's like when a fly flies right next to your head and it's in full stride and you
[1598.46s -> 1602.34s]  get that by your, oh, imagine if they played Nyan cat.
[1606.09s -> 1606.85s]  Another one of these.
[1610.85s -> 1612.53s]  One 50 probably is a milestone somehow.
[1623.94s -> 1625.70s]  I talk about like YouTube shorts.
[1625.74s -> 1626.06s]  Oh yeah.
[1626.06s -> 1630.26s]  I checked out YouTube shorts the other day and oh, I wasn't a big, I wasn't a fan.
[1631.13s -> 1633.33s]  And this is what I'm exposing all of you to.
[1636.16s -> 1638.72s]  There's a, there's a little bit of hypocrisy there.
[1660.13s -> 1661.13s]  I'm just going to focus on this.
[1678.45s -> 1682.75s]  Folks said, dude, he just disappeared from my friends list.
[1689.81s -> 1691.01s]  Just like, oh, he, why is he not?
[1691.05s -> 1692.33s]  Why is it not online anymore?
[1692.33s -> 1692.97s]  What happened?
[1693.13s -> 1695.13s]  I, is he, is he appearing offline or what happened?
[1697.30s -> 1706.57s]  No, if anything, poke, this strengthened our friendship.
[1707.45s -> 1708.65s]  I just want to make sure you understand that.
[1712.61s -> 1714.25s]  This, this strengthened our bond.
[1718.64s -> 1719.44s]  What's the goal?
[1722.10s -> 1723.02s]  Well, that's simple.
[1724.80s -> 1727.44s]  Number on right side of screen goes up.
[1728.20s -> 1728.64s]  That's it.
[1729.52s -> 1731.92s]  It's pretty, I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory, I think.
[1747.93s -> 1749.53s]  Number on screen go up.
[1751.26s -> 1751.78s]  I like.
[1760.00s -> 1764.04s]  Oh, will we, will we, I can't fucking do it.
[1764.84s -> 1769.32s]  Will we reach 500,000 subs today, guys?
[1769.36s -> 1770.32s]  I don't know.
[1770.68s -> 1772.44s]  I have a feeling it's possible.
[1774.44s -> 1778.28s]  Will we cross 200,000 subs tonight?
[1783.48s -> 1786.32s]  What would I have had to have done to get this many subs immediately?
[1790.34s -> 1795.57s]  What would be causing this amount of people to sub to a channel this fast?
[1796.25s -> 1797.05s]  What would it take?
[1799.58s -> 1802.02s]  Is this what, this is what happens if I shove the baseball up my ass?
[1802.02s -> 1802.54s]  Somebody said.
[1812.29s -> 1818.61s]  I'm not, I'm not, I am not shoving a baseball up my ass until we hit a million subs.
[1818.61s -> 1818.97s]  Right?
[1819.97s -> 1820.77s]  Let's just sit here.
[1821.25s -> 1821.73s]  Just what?
[1821.73s -> 1822.41s]  Just holding it.
[1831.52s -> 1833.28s]  I feel like it would be going down.
[1833.48s -> 1834.76s]  This would be going down.
[1835.73s -> 1836.77s]  This would not be going up.
[1836.77s -> 1837.93s]  This would be going down.
[1845.78s -> 1849.86s]  No, this is very, hey, everybody in chat, quiet for a second.
[1850.30s -> 1853.02s]  We're talking about a comedic jokey thing.
[1853.50s -> 1854.78s]  This is not a real thing.
[1854.78s -> 1856.42s]  We're just talking about a jokey thing.
[1856.54s -> 1860.65s]  This is me pretending, please for the love of God, stop it.
[1861.41s -> 1861.89s]  Stop.
[1861.93s -> 1864.85s]  We already crossed a million followers in the channel like a year ago.
[1865.05s -> 1866.45s]  So excuse me.
[1874.26s -> 1874.42s]  All right.
[1874.42s -> 1875.62s]  We'll check back in on that later.
[1881.27s -> 1881.43s]  All right.
[1881.43s -> 1881.95s]  What's the next one?
[1883.12s -> 1884.96s]  Ooh, what are we going to upgrade?
[1885.60s -> 1886.28s]  What can I upgrade?
[1892.96s -> 1893.44s]  The bomb?
[1899.86s -> 1901.06s]  I don't think you can upgrade some of them.
[1902.20s -> 1903.84s]  Some of them just cannot be upgraded.
[1904.68s -> 1905.72s]  What about one of the little babies?
[1918.16s -> 1919.16s]  I got to get my subs up.
[1924.31s -> 1926.63s]  Oh, I farted.
[1929.79s -> 1930.19s]  It's working.
[1930.19s -> 1930.55s]  It's working.
[1941.64s -> 1942.72s]  Oh no, they're going to go down.
[1947.29s -> 1947.69s]  All right.
[1947.69s -> 1948.09s]  All right.
[1948.37s -> 1950.17s]  I have to turn this fucking audio off.
[1950.53s -> 1958.78s]  Is it going to explode?
[1967.28s -> 1970.88s]  That honestly, that sounds like a, that sounds like a video that would be made in
[1970.88s -> 1971.80s]  2023, right?
[1973.32s -> 1974.96s]  On the wall here, I have my sub count.
[1976.18s -> 1979.74s]  I have to be in this room until my subs go over a million.
[1981.32s -> 1984.24s]  I cannot leave the room until it crosses that threshold.
[1995.36s -> 1995.92s]  I need more of these.
[1996.98s -> 1997.30s]  Look at this.
[1997.62s -> 1998.02s]  Look at this.
[1998.30s -> 1998.94s]  There's something here.
[1999.10s -> 1999.90s]  There's something on this wall too.
[1999.90s -> 2000.10s]  Look.
[2001.22s -> 2001.54s]  See this?
[2002.54s -> 2003.50s]  This like panels.
[2003.66s -> 2004.46s]  I'll probably get to open them.
[2004.78s -> 2005.18s]  I bet.
[2007.61s -> 2007.77s]  All right.
[2007.77s -> 2008.05s]  What was that?
[2008.05s -> 2008.45s]  Two 50.
[2008.45s -> 2009.13s]  What happens in two 50?
[2011.95s -> 2013.27s]  Maybe smash them with the metal duck.
[2013.75s -> 2014.03s]  Okay.
[2015.14s -> 2019.06s]  I mean that very clearly, it probably, maybe you upgrade it and it opens to like
[2019.06s -> 2019.94s]  another button to press.
[2020.89s -> 2021.09s]  All right.
[2021.09s -> 2025.67s]  Where is, where is the metal duck over here?
[2029.37s -> 2030.77s]  That was, it's so loud.
[2031.82s -> 2033.18s]  So you say smash this against the wall.
[2036.44s -> 2036.88s]  It worked.
[2036.88s -> 2037.16s]  It worked.
[2037.16s -> 2037.44s]  It worked.
[2037.44s -> 2037.68s]  It worked.
[2037.68s -> 2037.88s]  All right.
[2037.88s -> 2038.28s]  All right.
[2038.36s -> 2038.88s]  I got something.
[2038.88s -> 2039.20s]  What is this?
[2039.24s -> 2040.28s]  X marks that.
[2041.21s -> 2041.37s]  All right.
[2041.37s -> 2041.89s]  What about over here?
[2045.26s -> 2049.35s]  Ooh, what's that?
[2058.72s -> 2058.88s]  Yeah.
[2058.88s -> 2059.84s]  I knew you could open those.
[2060.48s -> 2061.16s]  Is there any more of those?
[2067.68s -> 2068.12s]  There's gotta be.
[2068.12s -> 2069.04s]  Wait, a bomb.
[2069.32s -> 2069.96s]  Bomb, bomb, bomb.
[2072.77s -> 2073.53s]  Why is this a skeleton?
[2074.36s -> 2076.00s]  I'm going to throw the bomb at this.
[2076.40s -> 2077.48s]  It's absolutely what you have to do.
[2081.35s -> 2082.07s]  There's one on the roof.
[2083.08s -> 2083.88s]  Oh, there is one right there.
[2083.92s -> 2085.20s]  I don't think I can make that though.
[2088.37s -> 2090.57s]  Maybe with the, I don't think I had to like get higher.
[2093.24s -> 2093.44s]  All right.
[2093.44s -> 2093.72s]  Two.
[2093.72s -> 2094.64s]  We crossed two 50.
[2094.64s -> 2095.40s]  No button to press.
[2107.92s -> 2111.71s]  Who can I, can I, can I actually upgrade the, this thing still?
[2111.83s -> 2118.92s]  The, the Nyan one, or will you guys upgrade the skeleton?
[2119.00s -> 2120.16s]  Ooh, can I?
[2121.40s -> 2122.56s]  Whoa, it worked.
[2123.23s -> 2123.87s]  What does that do?
[2124.61s -> 2125.25s]  It has a face.
[2126.56s -> 2127.28s]  Is it worth anything?
[2128.04s -> 2128.80s]  I can't tell.
[2133.92s -> 2134.12s]  Okay.
[2134.12s -> 2134.52s]  That's cool.
[2137.72s -> 2138.64s]  We got to keep these things moving.
[2138.64s -> 2140.28s]  If you see one on the ground, it's not moving.
[2140.28s -> 2140.92s]  We have to make it move.
[2147.47s -> 2147.87s]  There we go.
[2147.99s -> 2148.75s]  That's much faster.
[2150.32s -> 2150.88s]  Something broke.
[2151.20s -> 2151.60s]  Whoa.
[2151.64s -> 2152.80s]  What, what was that?
[2154.16s -> 2155.04s]  Oh, look at this.
[2156.25s -> 2162.24s]  One of the big ones broke into a little ones that are giving me more.
[2163.90s -> 2166.30s]  I think when they break, they give you money or whatever it is.
[2166.66s -> 2168.82s]  Subscribers or whatever, whatever that who cares.
[2172.48s -> 2172.68s]  Nice.
[2176.41s -> 2176.65s]  Yeah.
[2176.69s -> 2176.93s]  All right.
[2178.06s -> 2179.46s]  Bomb on X bomb on X.
[2179.46s -> 2180.26s]  I can't get it to blow up.
[2180.38s -> 2181.54s]  Do I need a fire duck?
[2182.27s -> 2182.95s]  That would make sense.
[2196.64s -> 2200.92s]  I, you know, if there was a statistic to tell how many people muted the stream,
[2201.08s -> 2203.68s]  put it on the other monitor and are doing something else on the other monitor.
[2204.36s -> 2208.18s]  I think I might've broken the record for this channel right now.
[2216.34s -> 2218.06s]  Oh, pixel duck.
[2230.97s -> 2231.21s]  Dude.
[2231.21s -> 2232.17s]  That's every stream.
[2233.71s -> 2235.87s]  That's you're, you're so funny.
[2237.52s -> 2243.58s]  All right.
[2243.58s -> 2252.54s]  We have to blow this wall up with the bomb, but I don't think we're going to move the
[2252.54s -> 2253.34s]  big one around more.
[2254.14s -> 2255.06s]  It's worth so much more.
[2263.20s -> 2263.56s]  Where'd it go?
[2265.84s -> 2266.56s]  There we go.
[2266.56s -> 2266.92s]  Look at that.
[2266.92s -> 2267.84s]  300 K already.
[2286.42s -> 2287.30s]  What is it worth?
[2288.13s -> 2288.97s]  It's hard to tell.
[2296.51s -> 2296.75s]  All right.
[2296.79s -> 2300.04s]  Every, uh, everybody minimize the screen for a second.
[2304.44s -> 2304.72s]  Okay.
[2304.80s -> 2305.68s]  Minimize the screen.
[2307.17s -> 2308.85s]  Just like, don't just don't watch for a second.
[2308.85s -> 2309.53s]  I'm warning you.
[2309.77s -> 2310.17s]  Here we go.
[2310.17s -> 2311.56s]  Three, two.
[2311.60s -> 2313.80s]  What's going to get wild on the screen.
[2313.84s -> 2314.20s]  You ready?
[2314.20s -> 2315.04s]  Three, two, one.
[2318.31s -> 2319.55s]  That actually might be a good strategy.
[2333.08s -> 2334.56s]  I think we just need to do more of this.
[2337.96s -> 2340.28s]  No, I don't want more than 340,000 subs.
[2340.28s -> 2341.60s]  It's going to crash my computer.
[2343.44s -> 2345.66s]  I need to break this very clearly.
[2346.85s -> 2348.53s]  The last one broke and it was, it gave us a lot.
[2361.40s -> 2362.88s]  Throw gold at glass duck.
[2364.00s -> 2364.88s]  I was going to try that after.
[2373.05s -> 2373.93s]  Oh, it's going to work.
[2374.17s -> 2374.69s]  I can hear it.
[2379.46s -> 2381.30s]  Ooh.
[2394.02s -> 2395.41s]  Um, all right.
[2395.41s -> 2400.93s]  Once we get to half a million, I will put on whatever, uh, mods.
[2401.33s -> 2402.49s]  Just, Hey mods.
[2402.97s -> 2405.85s]  It's hard for me to talk, to take, to think and talk.
[2406.53s -> 2411.06s]  Um, can, can one of you, all right, hold on.
[2411.06s -> 2412.14s]  I need to say, I need to take my headphones out.
[2413.20s -> 2420.25s]  Uh, can somebody put a poll up of four fun OSTs to listen to and
[2420.45s -> 2421.69s]  just check and vote on it?
[2421.77s -> 2423.37s]  Mods can determine what they are.
[2423.41s -> 2424.85s]  We're looking for video game OSTs.
[2426.65s -> 2427.01s]  I'm good.
[2428.14s -> 2428.38s]  Okay.
[2428.42s -> 2429.90s]  Now I, now I cannot talk anymore.
[2429.90s -> 2431.26s]  I can't think anymore because my headphones are in.
[2435.27s -> 2436.19s]  Can you mute the music?
[2436.19s -> 2436.59s]  I wonder.
[2439.88s -> 2440.80s]  Progress will be saved.
[2440.80s -> 2440.92s]  All right.
[2440.92s -> 2441.08s]  Hold on.
[2441.08s -> 2441.48s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[2444.42s -> 2444.66s]  Hold on.
[2444.66s -> 2445.30s]  Can I mute the music?
[2447.08s -> 2447.52s]  I can't.
[2449.80s -> 2451.60s]  What duck decks?
[2452.12s -> 2453.64s]  Oh, it tells you what you found.
[2463.12s -> 2465.00s]  Wake it up in the corner of the room.
[2467.53s -> 2469.29s]  Oh, I don't know.
[2469.29s -> 2470.29s]  No, I don't.
[2470.33s -> 2470.97s]  I don't.
[2471.80s -> 2473.88s]  I don't care about how many subs I have.
[2474.62s -> 2475.62s]  Why did I do this?
[2478.41s -> 2479.93s]  Why do I give a shit about this?
[2479.93s -> 2481.05s]  I could just be doing anything.
[2481.05s -> 2483.29s]  I could be relaxing on the couch right now.
[2484.02s -> 2485.82s]  I don't care about how many subs come in.
[2488.26s -> 2488.94s]  It's too much.
[2488.94s -> 2489.50s]  It's too much.
[2489.50s -> 2490.34s]  Too many subs.
[2494.58s -> 2495.58s]  Hey, what's going on everybody.
[2495.58s -> 2496.46s]  Welcome back to the video.
[2496.46s -> 2501.42s]  It's me checking out that sub counter as we see here.
[2501.42s -> 2505.60s]  It's at 400,000 subs getting there.
[2506.00s -> 2508.80s]  I'd like to see that hit a million.
[2516.78s -> 2520.79s]  Jerry, I want to see it at a million subs, Jerry.
[2526.79s -> 2527.71s]  That's never going to happen.
[2527.71s -> 2529.31s]  We are absolutely going to get to a million.
[2529.31s -> 2530.47s]  There's no way we are not.
[2538.16s -> 2538.36s]  All right.
[2538.36s -> 2542.25s]  What do we got for, uh, what we got for, uh, OST voting?
[2542.97s -> 2543.65s]  Blow up the wall.
[2543.65s -> 2546.01s]  I don't know how I was thinking about this.
[2546.05s -> 2546.89s]  Yeah, I was trying to.
[2547.45s -> 2548.61s]  I need to light the fuse.
[2549.80s -> 2551.20s]  See, there's a fuse.
[2551.24s -> 2560.68s]  I need to light, but I was holding that way.
[2560.68s -> 2561.44s]  These are closed again.
[2573.00s -> 2574.72s]  This is going to blow up in my face.
[2574.76s -> 2577.84s]  It's going to blow up my face and be extremely loud.
[2587.60s -> 2588.24s]  I don't think so.
[2601.36s -> 2602.08s]  I like that one.
[2610.08s -> 2612.16s]  It's like a bullet going by my face.
[2612.64s -> 2615.04s]  It's that's, I don't like that.
[2624.99s -> 2625.79s]  Wait, hold on.
[2627.16s -> 2634.54s]  Can I pick an OST?
[2634.54s -> 2638.09s]  The mods have decided on a few, uh, get us in something.
[2639.46s -> 2640.62s]  Just chill and play the game.
[2651.92s -> 2653.12s]  I haven't seen an upgrade in a while.
[2663.64s -> 2664.96s]  These are not generating any points.
[2664.96s -> 2667.16s]  They have to be increased.
[2670.56s -> 2671.40s]  What's the diamond?
[2672.20s -> 2674.84s]  Uh, diamond is a diamond.
[2681.52s -> 2683.84s]  I can, I don't think I can reach anything up there yet.
[2686.12s -> 2687.24s]  I can't throw the metal on that.
[2687.24s -> 2688.48s]  I can't throw the bomb that high either.
[2690.14s -> 2690.94s]  Maybe the bone.
[2694.84s -> 2696.32s]  No, I don't think I have enough power to throw.
[2702.08s -> 2702.64s]  Maybe this one.
[2703.98s -> 2705.26s]  Oh, I actually might hit it with that one.
[2705.26s -> 2705.66s]  Hold on.
[2710.18s -> 2710.58s]  Shit.
[2715.51s -> 2715.83s]  Damn it.
[2717.05s -> 2719.05s]  Uh, congratulations, everybody.
[2719.05s -> 2720.05s]  Plock has won.
[2721.30s -> 2726.75s]  Uh, give me one sec while I turn this down.
[2735.21s -> 2735.65s]  All right.
[2737.21s -> 2739.09s]  I feel like my soul just re-entered my body.
[2741.77s -> 2741.97s]  All right.
[2741.97s -> 2743.17s]  Let's put on Plock.
[2743.89s -> 2744.73s]  Plock OST.
[2744.77s -> 2746.37s]  We listen to this all the time, but it's a good one.
[2758.45s -> 2758.93s]  All right.
[2759.97s -> 2760.81s]  Yeah.
[2760.85s -> 2763.09s]  Now everybody can relax.
[2771.40s -> 2772.40s]  Now we got a vibe going.
[2775.24s -> 2775.80s]  There we go.
[2779.57s -> 2781.01s]  I'm missing the quacks, but it's fine.
[2786.76s -> 2787.60s]  Turn it up a little louder.
[2788.00s -> 2788.36s]  You got it.
[2791.77s -> 2792.77s]  That's as loud as I'm willing to go.
[2795.96s -> 2796.08s]  All right.
[2796.08s -> 2796.80s]  Almost a half million.
[2798.02s -> 2798.54s]  Oh shit.
[2798.54s -> 2800.06s]  I just, I just turned the stream off.
[2805.98s -> 2809.62s]  I can jam to this and just play.
[2810.14s -> 2810.66s]  I'm into that.
[2813.90s -> 2814.66s]  All right, here we go.
[2814.66s -> 2815.54s]  We're at half a million.
[2816.59s -> 2817.15s]  Yes.
[2823.87s -> 2824.07s]  All right.
[2824.07s -> 2824.75s]  This is an upgrade.
[2824.75s -> 2827.11s]  This one's really important because I don't know who to give this to.
[2835.57s -> 2838.01s]  I think that, can I give it to anybody besides the skeleton?
[2838.21s -> 2838.97s]  What about the metal one?
[2839.69s -> 2840.09s]  Bomb?
[2847.65s -> 2848.69s]  I don't think I can give it to bomb.
[2849.33s -> 2849.89s]  All right, here we go.
[2851.82s -> 2852.22s]  All right.
[2853.65s -> 2854.65s]  Uh, this one, what did it do?
[2859.44s -> 2860.36s]  Give it a pixel duck.
[2861.16s -> 2862.04s]  Oh shit.
[2871.02s -> 2872.30s]  Uh, we're at 515.
[2872.30s -> 2873.90s]  It's going, it's going a lot faster.
[2875.41s -> 2875.57s]  All right.
[2875.57s -> 2876.25s]  I'm going to focus.
[2879.20s -> 2879.72s]  I need to start.
[2879.88s -> 2880.60s]  Look at this.
[2881.12s -> 2882.12s]  Look at how terrible I'm doing.
[2882.44s -> 2884.48s]  Look at all the, all the ducks that are on the ground that are not bouncing.
[2889.91s -> 2891.79s]  What am I, am I, am I even playing the game?
[2898.74s -> 2900.58s]  I need to be moving this one a lot.
[2902.31s -> 2902.55s]  Yep.
[2902.55s -> 2903.11s]  There we go.
[2903.79s -> 2904.59s]  Look at that number climb.
[2909.09s -> 2910.09s]  I need to like whack it.
[2915.73s -> 2917.73s]  This does feel like a YouTube short now.
[2928.37s -> 2928.89s]  600.
[2928.89s -> 2929.65s]  What happens at a million?
[2931.77s -> 2932.85s]  I missed the quacks.
[2933.80s -> 2937.08s]  I missed the quacks too, but removing the quacks also removed.
[2937.68s -> 2943.08s]  Um, uh, for the next three hours straight.
[2945.21s -> 2946.65s]  So it's a sacrifice we had to make.
[2954.20s -> 2955.00s]  I got to move the big one.
[2955.00s -> 2955.68s]  It has the most points.
[2955.68s -> 2958.32s]  So we just have to use the metal one is continuously move the big one.
[2962.11s -> 2964.51s]  Just play quacking sounds in the background.
[2966.32s -> 2968.48s]  No, no, I, no, I need a break.
[2968.72s -> 2969.12s]  I need a break.
[2969.16s -> 2970.52s]  I've been playing this for like 40 minutes.
[2970.56s -> 2972.48s]  I need a quick break from all that.
[2973.70s -> 2977.38s]  Let me just listen to pluck and throw things into walls and talk just for a little bit.
[2978.78s -> 2979.46s]  We need a break.
[2981.77s -> 2982.45s]  Everything's gonna be all right.
[2996.90s -> 2997.86s]  There's a speaker box.
[2998.50s -> 2998.78s]  Yeah.
[2998.78s -> 2999.78s]  This is the speaker box.
[2999.78s -> 3002.34s]  Unfortunately, it only turns off the music coming out of this.
[3002.34s -> 3004.42s]  It does not turn off the Nyan cat song.
[3008.67s -> 3015.57s]  I think I was going to go with some growth and growth makes sense here.
[3024.97s -> 3025.53s]  I'm going to focus.
[3025.57s -> 3025.81s]  Okay.
[3025.81s -> 3027.85s]  I'm going to focus on growth for the next 10 straight minutes.
[3029.23s -> 3029.55s]  All right.
[3031.67s -> 3038.15s]  So if I do anything besides focus on growth, I would like for you to all to be yell at me because that's exactly what I'm trying to do.
[3038.99s -> 3045.88s]  So at one hour streamed exactly is when I'm going to stop focusing on growth.
[3050.68s -> 3052.40s]  And then we'll focus on something else for a little bit.
[3062.20s -> 3063.28s]  If I see one, I'm going to bounce one.
[3067.16s -> 3068.32s]  How did I miss that close?
[3069.90s -> 3081.53s]  Where I wasn't actually, it actually is a little too soft.
[3081.57s -> 3082.33s]  Let's put it up a little louder.
[3092.80s -> 3092.92s]  All right.
[3092.92s -> 3093.64s]  That's a little meatier.
[3094.28s -> 3094.88s]  That's meatier.
[3098.95s -> 3101.35s]  We don't want it to meaty, but we'll be able to hear it.
[3101.47s -> 3101.83s]  You'll hear it.
[3107.34s -> 3107.50s]  All right.
[3107.50s -> 3108.06s]  Growth, growth.
[3108.10s -> 3108.42s]  Yeah, I know.
[3108.42s -> 3108.70s]  I got it.
[3108.70s -> 3108.86s]  Got it.
[3124.47s -> 3127.39s]  I love the Super Nintendo trumpet sound.
[3127.43s -> 3128.31s]  Well, like what is it?
[3128.35s -> 3128.75s]  Tuba.
[3142.84s -> 3143.04s]  All right.
[3143.04s -> 3149.08s]  Seven more minutes of this and then I'll be probably close to a million.
[3163.88s -> 3173.04s]  600,000 stay in the corner.
[3173.04s -> 3173.60s]  This is perfect.
[3180.51s -> 3182.07s]  I wish these would just automatically jump around.
[3185.40s -> 3186.16s]  I need more of those.
[3186.16s -> 3187.68s]  Um, Nyan cat ones.
[3199.97s -> 3202.17s]  Somebody just said, I don't understand.
[3205.65s -> 3209.98s]  Uh, honestly, I think, I think you do.
[3211.20s -> 3215.00s]  I think you're just afraid to admit out loud that this is what I'm doing today.
[3216.36s -> 3220.00s]  So it's like, no, he's not, he's not doing this, right.
[3222.75s -> 3223.87s]  But I'm into it.
[3224.07s -> 3224.63s]  So that's what we're doing.
[3226.69s -> 3227.77s]  You wouldn't get it.
[3229.75s -> 3235.98s]  I mean, there is not very much to get right now, but there's such, there's such
[3235.98s -> 3239.18s]  little to get right now that I do understand the, like, what am I looking at here?
[3239.82s -> 3240.14s]  I get it.
[3259.10s -> 3259.70s]  Okay.
[3259.90s -> 3261.46s]  Uh, we have five more minutes of this.
[3261.86s -> 3263.10s]  Five more minutes of growth and we'll be good.
[3263.38s -> 3275.43s]  All right.
[3275.43s -> 3276.35s]  Get moving over here.
[3276.39s -> 3277.59s]  What is going on with this corner?
[3278.60s -> 3279.04s]  Get moving.
[3298.16s -> 3298.88s]  Boss fight, right?
[3306.59s -> 3306.83s]  Shit.
[3309.38s -> 3309.58s]  Shit.
[3314.28s -> 3316.52s]  It's actually going to get hard to pick up the ducks on the ground.
[3321.37s -> 3323.29s]  Oh, this is the one that I did that dance to that.
[3323.29s -> 3324.81s]  I keep seeing the same dance.
[3327.44s -> 3327.68s]  Point.
[3328.08s -> 3357.36s]  Point, point, point, point, you know, the one, uh, three more minutes we'll be at
[3357.36s -> 3368.44s]  700 and then after that, we're going to bounce around the big King duck and
[3368.44s -> 3371.04s]  hopefully get to a million pretty quickly.
[3387.73s -> 3388.17s]  Green light.
[3388.21s -> 3389.17s]  Ooh, okay.
[3389.17s -> 3390.53s]  It's 700 Ks in a green light.
[3393.03s -> 3397.05s]  We got, oh my goodness.
[3402.48s -> 3403.56s]  We're still focusing on growth.
[3404.80s -> 3428.84s]  So actually starting to get hard to move around.
[3440.30s -> 3441.26s]  A million was going to be easy.
[3442.14s -> 3444.50s]  Really underestimated how easy that was going to be to get there.
[3445.66s -> 3446.74s]  I mean, actually it's an hour.
[3446.98s -> 3449.30s]  You have to dedicate like at least 30 to 40 minutes to doing this.
[3451.92s -> 3452.64s]  I mean, I'm into it though.
[3452.64s -> 3452.88s]  I'm here.
[3465.84s -> 3466.24s]  Oh wait.
[3466.28s -> 3468.52s]  Bit rate, bit rate, bit rate, bit rate.
[3468.64s -> 3469.52s]  Oh no.
[3471.11s -> 3473.03s]  Is this going to be a bit rate stream?
[3476.37s -> 3477.13s]  How bad is it?
[3479.26s -> 3480.18s]  It's not that bad.
[3480.22s -> 3480.54s]  Okay.
[3480.58s -> 3481.26s]  It's actually fine.
[3481.38s -> 3481.58s]  Okay.
[3481.58s -> 3481.70s]  Okay.
[3481.70s -> 3481.94s]  Okay.
[3482.54s -> 3494.67s]  It's fine.
[3495.58s -> 3498.82s]  I wonder how bad it'll get like vampire survivors.
[3502.72s -> 3506.65s]  I got one more minute of growth and then I'm going to focus on just trying to get
[3506.65s -> 3508.01s]  points with the big one and the metal.
[3514.30s -> 3514.54s]  There you go.
[3522.91s -> 3523.75s]  Uh, all right.
[3523.75s -> 3525.03s]  We're, we're pretty much done with growth.
[3532.24s -> 3533.04s]  800,000.
[3537.92s -> 3539.24s]  This is an electric guitar.
[3546.64s -> 3547.40s]  Why is it darker?
[3548.60s -> 3550.16s]  Oh, one of the lights is out.
[3550.68s -> 3550.96s]  Hold on.
[3550.96s -> 3551.68s]  Did I do that?
[3551.84s -> 3553.04s]  I think I knocked a light out.
[3563.60s -> 3563.92s]  All right.
[3564.04s -> 3565.92s]  It's time to focus on a million.
[3570.17s -> 3579.87s]  Let's make sure everything on the ground is moving pretty much.
[3579.91s -> 3580.23s]  All right.
[3584.31s -> 3585.07s]  Whoa.
[3585.11s -> 3587.57s]  That had a, I broke the radio.
[3588.91s -> 3589.31s]  Oh shit.
[3589.31s -> 3589.91s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3589.99s -> 3590.67s]  What do I give this to?
[3594.76s -> 3595.36s]  Who should eat that?
[3600.16s -> 3600.60s]  Pixel.
[3600.84s -> 3601.08s]  All right.
[3601.44s -> 3604.88s]  Where's pixel duck over here?
[3608.03s -> 3616.28s]  Oh, is it, is it going to be, what's it's worth now?
[3617.44s -> 3618.04s]  Like the rainbow.
[3618.08s -> 3618.36s]  All right.
[3618.40s -> 3621.68s]  Um, is it going to do, is it going to bounce around like the Nyan cat or no?
[3622.25s -> 3622.97s]  It's just worth a lot.
[3629.89s -> 3630.69s]  It's probably worth a lot.
[3633.97s -> 3634.17s]  All right.
[3634.33s -> 3635.85s]  Focus on hitting big one.
[3642.55s -> 3643.27s]  Throw the bomb up.
[3647.21s -> 3647.29s]  Yeah.
[3647.29s -> 3648.09s]  I can't reach that far.
[3649.62s -> 3650.82s]  The roof is still not broken.
[3650.82s -> 3650.94s]  Yeah.
[3650.94s -> 3651.90s]  I can't reach this far though.
[3660.15s -> 3660.63s]  Skeleton.
[3673.91s -> 3677.16s]  Wait, is that, that's not a fire.
[3677.16s -> 3677.44s]  Is it?
[3677.92s -> 3678.92s]  It's not like a candlelight.
[3680.35s -> 3680.99s]  Is that a candle?
[3683.38s -> 3684.82s]  Wait, this thing's smoking now.
[3685.42s -> 3687.51s]  Does this count as a fire?
[3694.14s -> 3695.02s]  That might count as a fire.
[3711.08s -> 3712.40s]  Wait, maybe I can throw this to the roof.
[3715.91s -> 3717.11s]  I might be able to make it to the roof with that.
[3721.90s -> 3722.94s]  Ah, oh shit.
[3722.94s -> 3723.50s]  I almost had it.
[3728.73s -> 3729.01s]  Damn it.
[3735.40s -> 3736.00s]  That's hitting it.
[3736.32s -> 3743.86s]  Oh, somebody said, maybe I can do this.
[3746.30s -> 3748.74s]  Place this and maybe throw something heavy at it and smush it.
[3749.30s -> 3762.73s]  I don't think that's going to work.
[3764.12s -> 3765.20s]  It's a couple of good direct hits.
[3766.26s -> 3767.14s]  Break the other lights.
[3769.97s -> 3770.89s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3770.89s -> 3771.45s]  This is important.
[3772.68s -> 3773.80s]  I'm almost at a million subs.
[3774.64s -> 3775.76s]  Get, get out of my way.
[3775.76s -> 3776.76s]  This is my moment.
[3779.80s -> 3780.80s]  I was at a million subs guys.
[3798.55s -> 3799.39s]  I was here.
[3804.78s -> 3805.86s]  I need to unmute for this.
[3808.42s -> 3808.90s]  Did I unmute?
[3820.11s -> 3820.75s]  No, I'm going to miss it.
[3820.75s -> 3821.19s]  I'm going to miss it.
[3824.72s -> 3825.92s]  No, I'm going to actually miss it.
[3837.18s -> 3845.86s]  One million subscribers.
[3845.86s -> 3846.54s]  Something's happening now.
[3849.52s -> 3849.72s]  All right.
[3849.72s -> 3851.56s]  We need to turn this off, this music off.
[3853.67s -> 3854.71s]  What is going on right now?
[3856.16s -> 3856.68s]  Turn the volume up.
[3864.33s -> 3865.01s]  Did I just beat the game?
[3872.65s -> 3873.17s]  I can't move.
[3886.64s -> 3887.04s]  I just won.
[3889.40s -> 3890.00s]  I can't move.
[3895.40s -> 3896.20s]  I think I have to catch them.
[3898.81s -> 3899.09s]  He's coming.
[3899.09s -> 3900.37s]  He's actually walking towards me.
[3905.81s -> 3906.61s]  Shit, he's coming.
[3910.52s -> 3912.04s]  Is this going to do like a five minutes at Freddy's?
[3912.04s -> 3914.72s]  Like, if I'm just, I'm warning you, it probably will.
[3915.16s -> 3916.20s]  We're probably there right now.
[3916.20s -> 3917.84s]  You jump scare probably incoming.
[3930.59s -> 3930.91s]  What?
[3931.35s -> 3932.47s]  I didn't beat it.
[3933.99s -> 3934.47s]  The end.
[3935.13s -> 3936.17s]  The game just turned off.
[3944.11s -> 3945.35s]  I got the, no, that was the good ending.
[3945.51s -> 3946.27s]  I said, good ending.
[3952.04s -> 3953.04s]  How do I get the bad ending?
[3956.82s -> 3960.06s]  You had this open for 15 minutes before your stream.
[3964.35s -> 3964.63s]  Yeah.
[3964.63s -> 3967.63s]  Cause I had, I was like getting my stream ready.
[3969.97s -> 3973.97s]  And it was just sitting on the menu because I was like, I had to get my stream ready.
[3973.97s -> 3974.93s]  I had to, you have something to eat.
[3975.57s -> 3976.85s]  I didn't want to just close everything.
[3979.08s -> 3979.32s]  All right.
[3979.32s -> 3980.84s]  So how do I get the other endings?
[3980.84s -> 3982.00s]  I need to open that thing up there.
[3987.28s -> 3988.76s]  You need to, okay.
[3988.76s -> 3989.44s]  Skeleton duck.
[3989.48s -> 3991.24s]  But how do I open this thing?
[3991.88s -> 3993.36s]  I don't know how I need to blow up the wall too.
[3995.29s -> 3995.57s]  All right.
[3995.61s -> 3996.21s]  Blow the wall up.
[3996.21s -> 3996.73s]  That's important.
[4001.42s -> 4001.66s]  Okay.
[4001.66s -> 4002.38s]  How do I do that?
[4003.16s -> 4004.00s]  I need the bomb.
[4005.76s -> 4006.84s]  There are multiple endings.
[4006.96s -> 4011.84s]  Apparently I want to get at least a couple of them.
[4013.81s -> 4014.93s]  Upgrade the skeleton all the way.
[4018.96s -> 4020.48s]  But I might have to do a new game for that though.
[4024.25s -> 4024.45s]  All right.
[4024.45s -> 4025.21s]  Where's bomb duck?
[4025.57s -> 4027.17s]  How do I light bomb duck?
[4034.07s -> 4044.52s]  Break the radio on bomb duck sparks from the light.
[4048.41s -> 4049.57s]  Yeah, we'll get, let's break all the lights.
[4057.38s -> 4058.30s]  How do I get more force?
[4064.08s -> 4065.16s]  Do I have to do it with the gold one?
[4070.33s -> 4078.84s]  Maybe I have to get some, get some air stand on the box.
[4087.96s -> 4088.28s]  Oh wait.
[4088.32s -> 4088.80s]  I know what you mean.
[4096.65s -> 4096.97s]  Okay.
[4101.26s -> 4101.66s]  Damn it.
[4105.95s -> 4107.15s]  Can you smash the screen?
[4107.15s -> 4108.11s]  Smash the screen.
[4108.39s -> 4108.63s]  Hold on.
[4108.63s -> 4109.43s]  Wait, that might actually work.
[4119.55s -> 4120.03s]  I broke it.
[4123.11s -> 4123.59s]  What did that do?
[4132.91s -> 4133.67s]  I want to open that.
[4133.67s -> 4134.79s]  I want to open the ceiling panel.
[4140.53s -> 4141.49s]  Wall panels might do it.
[4141.73s -> 4142.81s]  That's a good idea.
[4155.21s -> 4156.41s]  Stop knocking it out of my hand.
[4163.86s -> 4164.34s]  Stop.
[4171.70s -> 4172.50s]  This might be fire.
[4172.50s -> 4174.58s]  It actually might be, but how did I break it before?
[4177.33s -> 4178.25s]  I'm going to start over.
[4182.67s -> 4184.35s]  Try to make a spark with the metal one on.
[4184.88s -> 4185.08s]  Yeah.
[4185.08s -> 4185.72s]  I tried that before.
[4185.72s -> 4186.32s]  It didn't really work.
[4190.58s -> 4191.14s]  Start over.
[4193.36s -> 4194.64s]  Smash the radio with the metal.
[4205.46s -> 4205.94s]  Oh shit.
[4205.94s -> 4206.18s]  Shit.
[4206.18s -> 4206.34s]  Okay.
[4206.34s -> 4206.62s]  I got one.
[4206.62s -> 4206.90s]  I got one.
[4207.46s -> 4208.38s]  Now who do I give this to?
[4210.43s -> 4211.15s]  The bone?
[4211.39s -> 4218.56s]  It's not there yet.
[4221.30s -> 4222.30s]  Do I get any more?
[4222.50s -> 4225.62s]  Um, do I get any more juice to give to the bone duck?
[4230.66s -> 4231.02s]  Bomb?
[4231.06s -> 4232.38s]  Uh, I can't, I can't give it to the bomb.
[4232.90s -> 4234.02s]  The bomb doesn't take it.
[4241.32s -> 4242.20s]  You might have to restart.
[4243.32s -> 4244.44s]  I think you get one more.
[4249.32s -> 4251.32s]  You have to smash the radio when it's off.
[4265.01s -> 4265.81s]  You would think this would work.
[4274.03s -> 4274.31s]  All right.
[4275.60s -> 4277.33s]  I got one more for the bone.
[4278.44s -> 4279.84s]  Ooh, now what?
[4280.28s -> 4280.96s]  What does this do now?
[4290.48s -> 4291.52s]  Maybe I can break the panels now.
[4297.95s -> 4299.11s]  I can't remove the panels with this.
[4302.44s -> 4303.56s]  It's just really cool looking.
[4304.60s -> 4305.52s]  Smash the radio more.
[4312.84s -> 4314.36s]  I feel like a caveman.
[4330.64s -> 4331.20s]  I don't think so.
[4341.24s -> 4342.44s]  I got to get that panel off.
[4343.72s -> 4345.52s]  Maybe I shouldn't have upgraded the duck.
[4346.28s -> 4348.20s]  I think I, all right, hear me out on this.
[4350.49s -> 4355.25s]  I might have to start over to get the small duck to break the lights and
[4355.25s -> 4356.45s]  break the panel off the ceiling.
[4359.89s -> 4360.41s]  You know what I mean?
[4362.02s -> 4363.62s]  The metal duck will create sparks.
[4363.78s -> 4367.86s]  I can't get it.
[4372.49s -> 4373.41s]  God help us.
[4379.05s -> 4380.53s]  Use the angel for the ceiling.
[4381.88s -> 4382.56s]  Does it have enough weight?
[4392.72s -> 4394.04s]  I'm not sure this has enough weight.
[4398.72s -> 4399.68s]  Break the angel maybe?
[4401.07s -> 4401.87s]  That's not a bad idea.
[4408.24s -> 4409.32s]  Oh, that was a direct hit.
[4412.04s -> 4412.72s]  That was a direct hit.
[4412.76s -> 4413.84s]  Smash the button.
[4415.36s -> 4415.80s]  Good idea.
[4431.32s -> 4433.12s]  Smash that like button.
[4435.32s -> 4436.40s]  Press it a hundred times.
[4442.48s -> 4453.54s]  Oh, what just came out?
[4455.08s -> 4455.44s]  What was that?
[4455.88s -> 4456.40s]  I heard something come out.
[4459.10s -> 4459.62s]  What is that?
[4461.76s -> 4462.32s]  Potato?
[4462.32s -> 4463.12s]  Like a baked potato.
[4463.16s -> 4463.72s]  Ooh, wood.
[4463.72s -> 4464.28s]  This is wood.
[4464.28s -> 4465.08s]  Wood makes fire.
[4465.08s -> 4466.60s]  Fire makes electricity.
[4466.60s -> 4467.96s]  Electricity makes currents.
[4467.96s -> 4469.76s]  Currents allows for a bomb to be lit.
[4471.67s -> 4471.91s]  Okay.
[4471.91s -> 4472.27s]  Here we go.
[4484.54s -> 4484.98s]  Come on.
[4484.98s -> 4485.74s]  I need a spark.
[4499.76s -> 4500.68s]  This has to work.
[4502.12s -> 4503.56s]  How could I, how would this not light on fire?
[4504.38s -> 4505.50s]  You need fire.
[4505.58s -> 4507.10s]  I need a fire duck.
[4511.64s -> 4514.64s]  Wait, what if we put the fire, the wood right on top of the vent here?
[4515.77s -> 4516.53s]  Can we like roast it?
[4516.85s -> 4517.65s]  Like a marshmallow kind of?
[4529.13s -> 4531.29s]  No, we need, we need a duck that's on fire.
[4538.53s -> 4540.61s]  So the way that you're problem solving is concerning.
[4543.84s -> 4546.48s]  Dude, it's a, it's a duck game.
[4550.80s -> 4552.24s]  I'm not changing a tire.
[4561.21s -> 4562.13s]  You were right the first time.
[4562.13s -> 4562.65s]  Restart.
[4563.17s -> 4563.69s]  Fire.
[4563.93s -> 4564.21s]  Okay.
[4564.21s -> 4564.53s]  All right.
[4564.57s -> 4565.65s]  Well, you have to, we're restarting.
[4568.67s -> 4569.83s]  It's a lot of ducks I haven't seen yet.
[4572.69s -> 4572.89s]  All right.
[4572.89s -> 4573.89s]  We'll get, we're going to restart.
[4575.96s -> 4576.36s]  New game.
[4582.59s -> 4583.75s]  Stop bullying Jerma.
[4583.83s -> 4584.39s]  Stop.
[4584.63s -> 4585.55s]  What the heck did I do?
[4585.63s -> 4589.18s]  Thank you.
[4591.56s -> 4592.20s]  You've ruined it.
[4592.56s -> 4593.24s]  I don't think I did.
[4593.73s -> 4594.69s]  I had the, okay.
[4594.69s -> 4597.67s]  That metal duck was small enough for me to throw.
[4598.76s -> 4603.08s]  I think I need to use the metal duck to break that panel and break the lights.
[4605.28s -> 4606.32s]  Oh shit.
[4608.87s -> 4609.63s]  I can get them back.
[4614.84s -> 4615.88s]  I'm not getting to a million again.
[4615.88s -> 4618.42s]  I just want to see, I want to see what's behind the panels.
[4619.02s -> 4620.30s]  We, I want to see the content.
[4627.88s -> 4629.20s]  That's a good strategy for the beginning.
[4634.87s -> 4652.71s]  It's kind of very gently.
[4652.71s -> 4653.79s]  You got to get, here we go right here.
[4653.83s -> 4654.95s]  And then just shake.
[4672.13s -> 4675.87s]  This gives us the metal one.
[4675.87s -> 4676.15s]  No.
[4676.64s -> 4676.96s]  All right.
[4678.20s -> 4679.08s]  I don't want to use that.
[4679.32s -> 4679.72s]  Okay.
[4679.72s -> 4679.96s]  Okay.
[4679.96s -> 4681.68s]  Keep all the power-ups in the corner.
[4683.83s -> 4685.59s]  Cause I don't want to use them until later.
[4691.80s -> 4717.30s]  So now, wood, you get the wood duck.
[4717.30s -> 4718.02s]  Oh, that's right.
[4737.22s -> 4737.54s]  All right.
[4737.54s -> 4738.26s]  Wood duck.
[4742.81s -> 4743.81s]  Upgrade the wood.
[4744.13s -> 4744.65s]  Let's see what happens.
[4753.02s -> 4753.46s]  Nothing.
[4753.66s -> 4756.44s]  No upgrade for the wood duck.
[4760.38s -> 4760.62s]  Okay.
[4760.62s -> 4762.06s]  Well, how much is the wood duck worth?
[4763.24s -> 4763.92s]  Nothing.
[4770.57s -> 4771.09s]  Nothing.
[4774.71s -> 4774.95s]  All right.
[4774.95s -> 4776.23s]  Well, we have to stay with the strategy.
[4777.07s -> 4778.11s]  Strat's going to stay the same.
[4786.12s -> 4786.52s]  What was that?
[4788.56s -> 4789.68s]  Look at the above.
[4793.10s -> 4796.58s]  Wait, what if we get to one, three, five, six and just don't do anything?
[4800.45s -> 4801.01s]  Does that make sense?
[4805.16s -> 4806.32s]  One, three, five, six.
[4806.32s -> 4806.76s]  And then I'm done.
[4807.20s -> 4807.36s]  Right.
[4807.36s -> 4808.12s]  I know I'm going to see what happens.
[4808.24s -> 4811.64s]  That's worth two.
[4811.64s -> 4811.84s]  All right.
[4811.84s -> 4813.56s]  We're going to do the wiggle strat.
[4813.56s -> 4813.76s]  Yep.
[4836.93s -> 4837.21s]  Right.
[4837.49s -> 4837.93s]  This is the one.
[4845.28s -> 4845.52s]  All right.
[4845.52s -> 4846.52s]  Keep that power up.
[4846.60s -> 4848.36s]  I probably want all of them over here.
[4850.04s -> 4850.76s]  I have two right now.
[4850.76s -> 4851.48s]  Don't let me forget that.
[4851.48s -> 4851.92s]  Cause I will.
[4855.41s -> 4875.44s]  One, three, five, six, seven 52.
[4877.72s -> 4879.44s]  I don't, I don't want anybody bouncing around right now.
[4889.60s -> 4891.20s]  Use the bottom tri corner.
[4891.87s -> 4894.39s]  I think I can't really crouch, but that actually worked pretty well.
[4903.37s -> 4903.97s]  I wish I could crouch.
[4906.49s -> 4907.45s]  What's your favorite pasta sauce?
[4908.01s -> 4909.01s]  Uh, that varies.
[4909.78s -> 4911.70s]  Sometimes it's like a tomato, garlic, basil.
[4911.94s -> 4916.16s]  Sometimes it's, um, nothing at all.
[4916.16s -> 4916.60s]  Actually.
[4916.60s -> 4918.72s]  A lot of times it's actually just olive oil and a little bit of salt.
[4919.45s -> 4920.13s]  A little bit of pepper.
[4922.68s -> 4924.28s]  That's probably actually my favorite way to eat it.
[4925.04s -> 4929.38s]  My favorite way to eat pasta is just a little bit of olive oil and a little bit
[4929.38s -> 4934.32s]  of salt and pepper, maybe sprinkle a little bit of Parmesan, but not necessarily.
[4936.72s -> 4937.76s]  Pesto is amazing too.
[4949.16s -> 4950.60s]  Butter, buttered noodles.
[4950.60s -> 4957.91s]  Andy, I would like for all of you to just look up pasta and olive oil and
[4957.91s -> 4959.91s]  understand that that is a classic dish.
[4959.95s -> 4962.99s]  That is not, that is not like a children's menu dish.
[4964.00s -> 4967.16s]  You actually need to look into that because you've got that wrong.
[4971.99s -> 4973.35s]  This is really upsetting him.
[4977.45s -> 4977.77s]  All right.
[4977.77s -> 4979.69s]  One, three, five, six.
[4989.64s -> 4990.56s]  Stop bouncing around.
[4993.29s -> 4993.45s]  Yeah.
[4993.45s -> 4997.37s]  I really, a nice olive oil pasta.
[4998.56s -> 4999.24s]  Not a whole lot either.
[4999.24s -> 5000.00s]  Just, just enough to get it.
[5001.00s -> 5002.80s]  A little bit, just like a touch of salt.
[5039.04s -> 5040.08s]  He's having fun.
[5040.32s -> 5042.36s]  Actually, I am actually having a lot of fun.
[5050.32s -> 5050.56s]  All right.
[5050.56s -> 5051.08s]  Wait a minute.
[5051.48s -> 5052.72s]  How many bounces does it do?
[5052.72s -> 5058.99s]  If I just let it go like right here, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[5059.03s -> 5059.79s]  Oh my God.
[5059.79s -> 5061.23s]  This is going to be fucking horrible.
[5100.92s -> 5101.32s]  Did I get it?
[5103.36s -> 5104.64s]  I don't know what happened.
[5105.12s -> 5106.12s]  I don't understand what I was supposed to do.
[5117.76s -> 5118.84s]  What did I, what did I do wrong?
[5118.88s -> 5119.48s]  Nothing happened.
[5121.74s -> 5124.50s]  You understood you just messed it up, but what did I do?
[5126.37s -> 5127.49s]  I have to actually restart it.
[5129.03s -> 5129.91s]  You were impatient.
[5131.66s -> 5134.54s]  Do I just stand in the middle of the room at one, three, five, six.
[5135.87s -> 5137.03s]  You need to click the button.
[5140.10s -> 5141.90s]  It just gave you, it just made the button green.
[5142.34s -> 5142.54s]  All right.
[5142.54s -> 5146.65s]  Did it actually even do anything or am I being gas lit?
[5161.23s -> 5161.95s]  3000.
[5164.56s -> 5164.80s]  All right.
[5164.80s -> 5165.48s]  Keep these.
[5168.79s -> 5169.83s]  You lost an upgrade.
[5169.91s -> 5172.08s]  Where's the, where's the other one?
[5173.60s -> 5174.24s]  Did this thing eat it?
[5180.64s -> 5181.00s]  Okay.
[5181.68s -> 5187.43s]  Um, I want the metal duck, so let's just go ahead and hang out and talk about
[5187.43s -> 5188.63s]  pasta for a little bit of minutes.
[5189.46s -> 5189.78s]  All right.
[5191.32s -> 5196.58s]  Uh, so there's the metal one right there.
[5199.98s -> 5200.22s]  All right.
[5200.22s -> 5200.54s]  Cool.
[5200.66s -> 5201.26s]  Perfect.
[5208.94s -> 5209.46s]  Nice.
[5209.58s -> 5209.86s]  Okay.
[5209.86s -> 5211.22s]  There's electricity up there now.
[5212.14s -> 5215.82s]  I think that means bomb, but let's break everything.
[5216.76s -> 5217.48s]  What happens when I do this?
[5223.01s -> 5224.53s]  You stupid piece of shit.
[5224.53s -> 5225.53s]  You actually got into the corner.
[5225.53s -> 5227.93s]  You viewed the DVD menu thing, hit the corner.
[5228.25s -> 5228.97s]  It's impossible.
[5235.44s -> 5237.08s]  That's exactly why I placed it all over there.
[5243.03s -> 5243.19s]  All right.
[5243.19s -> 5243.87s]  What happens when I do this?
[5249.31s -> 5249.43s]  Okay.
[5249.43s -> 5250.15s]  That's kind of creepy.
[5255.74s -> 5256.54s]  Don't touch that.
[5274.25s -> 5274.61s]  Okay.
[5276.51s -> 5276.87s]  Now what?
[5282.22s -> 5282.66s]  What was that?
[5285.39s -> 5286.99s]  It's like Satan duck.
[5291.68s -> 5292.08s]  I feed it.
[5294.83s -> 5295.91s]  I'm going to feed the Satan duck.
[5301.42s -> 5301.82s]  You can't.
[5306.64s -> 5307.24s]  Okay.
[5307.72s -> 5308.88s]  So what's the point of this though?
[5313.85s -> 5315.01s]  Now I'll get the angel duck.
[5317.91s -> 5318.79s]  Um, okay.
[5318.99s -> 5320.91s]  Angel duck is just any points, right?
[5330.04s -> 5331.12s]  What gives a lot of points?
[5332.04s -> 5333.36s]  I got to catch the, uh, all right.
[5333.36s -> 5334.40s]  This is going to be unbearable.
[5334.40s -> 5337.12s]  I'm apologize already, but we have to do this for a minute.
[5337.92s -> 5340.72s]  Uh, I need to grab that and go into the corner and just do the wiggle.
[5343.48s -> 5344.32s]  I need bone duck.
[5344.36s -> 5344.76s]  Oh, yep.
[5344.76s -> 5344.88s]  Yep.
[5344.88s -> 5345.04s]  Yep.
[5345.04s -> 5345.24s]  Yep.
[5345.24s -> 5345.44s]  Yep.
[5345.76s -> 5350.28s]  What corner is it in?
[5350.64s -> 5353.68s]  Thank God.
[5363.26s -> 5368.47s]  Hey, this bone green button.
[5372.95s -> 5374.99s]  Do not do not do not do not.
[5375.19s -> 5375.71s]  Here we go.
[5376.78s -> 5377.54s]  I think I have enough to do it.
[5377.54s -> 5377.78s]  Don't I?
[5378.18s -> 5381.23s]  The three or four are angel duck.
[5381.75s -> 5383.51s]  And I have the Satan duck.
[5384.15s -> 5385.07s]  What happens when I put them together?
[5401.93s -> 5402.69s]  Nothing so far.
[5410.15s -> 5411.07s]  I'm glad I have light though.
[5411.07s -> 5412.11s]  Let's put it like right in the middle.
[5419.20s -> 5419.40s]  All right.
[5419.40s -> 5420.28s]  There's a blue.
[5425.11s -> 5426.71s]  Hold the bad one.
[5426.91s -> 5427.27s]  Hold on.
[5435.00s -> 5435.76s]  Oh shit.
[5435.76s -> 5436.92s]  You make them evil.
[5438.04s -> 5442.04s]  Wait, can you do that with the angel duck too?
[5451.48s -> 5453.84s]  You can.
[5455.35s -> 5456.03s]  What is it doing?
[5457.08s -> 5458.72s]  Is it making them just regular size?
[5465.75s -> 5466.79s]  That's an original duck.
[5466.79s -> 5476.65s]  Now make it the King evil.
[5477.29s -> 5479.92s]  Can I even upgrade wrong duck?
[5488.33s -> 5490.05s]  I wish I could see anything.
[5490.37s -> 5494.40s]  Okay.
[5494.48s -> 5495.80s]  So wait, get over here.
[5496.16s -> 5496.80s]  Does it not do anything?
[5502.66s -> 5503.82s]  Read the duck decks.
[5507.50s -> 5508.10s]  Dark duck.
[5509.60s -> 5510.24s]  Bomb duck.
[5511.92s -> 5512.60s]  Holy duck.
[5514.60s -> 5515.36s]  Skeleton duck.
[5515.52s -> 5516.24s]  Still missing a few.
[5520.00s -> 5521.00s]  Extra large duck.
[5521.74s -> 5522.78s]  16 bit duck.
[5524.21s -> 5525.01s]  Holy duck.
[5526.12s -> 5527.08s]  Isn't that the one I already have though?
[5528.44s -> 5530.80s]  Read, read.
[5531.61s -> 5532.53s]  I can't like open this.
[5535.13s -> 5536.05s]  Throw the wood at the wire.
[5536.76s -> 5538.60s]  I don't want to throw the wood at the wire until I have the bomb.
[5547.04s -> 5547.56s]  That makes sense.
[5547.56s -> 5547.84s]  Doesn't it?
[5556.09s -> 5557.65s]  If I light it right now, will it stay on fire?
[5565.24s -> 5565.80s]  Oh shit.
[5565.80s -> 5566.76s]  I don't even know what the panel is.
[5571.34s -> 5572.02s]  Not that side.
[5578.09s -> 5579.77s]  Evil duck is removing points.
[5579.81s -> 5580.25s]  That's all right.
[5585.89s -> 5586.13s]  All right.
[5586.13s -> 5587.29s]  This is all right.
[5587.29s -> 5587.97s]  Here's bomb duck.
[5588.95s -> 5590.71s]  I need to take a second because I need light.
[5592.30s -> 5593.30s]  Where's the bomb panel.
[5595.68s -> 5599.60s]  I think it's, I just got hit in the head in like real life.
[5599.60s -> 5602.32s]  That felt like, okay, there's this panel.
[5603.78s -> 5606.50s]  The other panel is on the other side, right?
[5618.44s -> 5619.52s]  Where is this panel?
[5622.70s -> 5623.66s]  Where is the panel?
[5624.60s -> 5632.50s]  What side is the panel on above the button?
[5641.46s -> 5642.02s]  Does that work?
[5646.95s -> 5648.27s]  Hey dude, do you want to see the burrito?
[5649.07s -> 5650.79s]  Um, I'm sure it's delicious, but I'm good.
[5650.79s -> 5651.23s]  Thanks man.
[5652.60s -> 5653.00s]  There it is.
[5653.00s -> 5653.20s]  Okay.
[5653.20s -> 5653.48s]  I see.
[5660.48s -> 5660.96s]  Is that it?
[5666.48s -> 5668.34s]  I should have broke this before.
[5695.94s -> 5697.94s]  I wanted to place that there for some marker.
[5702.16s -> 5702.44s]  Got it.
[5704.90s -> 5705.22s]  Okay.
[5705.50s -> 5706.10s]  Wood duck.
[5710.09s -> 5710.89s]  Where's wooden duck?
[5712.09s -> 5713.29s]  Wooden duck is right here.
[5714.96s -> 5716.44s]  Light wooden duck on fire.
[5717.04s -> 5717.80s]  And then hold on.
[5717.88s -> 5718.52s]  It's a button to press.
[5722.25s -> 5722.57s]  Okay.
[5722.85s -> 5724.84s]  Put that in the corner over here.
[5727.08s -> 5727.28s]  Okay.
[5727.28s -> 5728.92s]  Where's that bomb panel?
[5728.92s -> 5730.32s]  It's right here.
[5739.44s -> 5740.00s]  Get over here.
[5748.43s -> 5748.67s]  All right.
[5748.71s -> 5749.43s]  There it is.
[5750.84s -> 5751.08s]  Place.
[5751.20s -> 5752.28s]  Can you place that a throw?
[5762.81s -> 5763.73s]  I don't think you can place.
[5765.60s -> 5767.84s]  I'd like for it to end up hanging out in the corner over there though.
[5768.42s -> 5768.74s]  Oh, whatever.
[5768.74s -> 5769.26s]  I know where it is.
[5769.26s -> 5769.70s]  Just give me.
[5780.14s -> 5781.14s]  I can't just let go of it.
[5783.91s -> 5786.79s]  And when you let go of it, you just whip it against the wall as hard as you can.
[5790.92s -> 5791.36s]  Is it off?
[5799.20s -> 5799.44s]  Okay.
[5799.44s -> 5799.88s]  It's off.
[5800.74s -> 5803.76s]  Now I need to, I have to place this here.
[5805.20s -> 5807.40s]  Like I have to just figure out how to get stuck.
[5809.98s -> 5811.10s]  It just bounces way too much.
[5814.08s -> 5814.92s]  We're gonna have to just guess.
[5818.10s -> 5818.26s]  All right.
[5818.26s -> 5818.74s]  Where's the wood?
[5833.21s -> 5833.57s]  Okay.
[5833.61s -> 5834.33s]  Let's light that.
[5837.08s -> 5838.08s]  Actually leave that there.
[5838.36s -> 5843.69s]  I'm going to put the bomb right here as close as I can get to this.
[5843.69s -> 5846.28s]  Cause it's going to fall and then I need to light it.
[5846.80s -> 5847.84s]  So it's right next to it.
[5847.84s -> 5848.04s]  Okay.
[5848.04s -> 5848.64s]  It's right here.
[5849.40s -> 5850.24s]  That's probably too close.
[5866.92s -> 5867.64s]  Is it not going to work?
[5872.36s -> 5872.80s]  Oh shit.
[5872.84s -> 5873.20s]  Oh shit.
[5873.20s -> 5873.56s]  Oh shit.
[5873.56s -> 5873.88s]  Oh shit.
[5873.92s -> 5874.12s]  Okay.
[5874.12s -> 5874.32s]  Okay.
[5874.32s -> 5874.60s]  Okay.
[5875.12s -> 5875.60s]  Where's the bomb?
[5875.88s -> 5876.85s]  Where's the bomb?
[5878.37s -> 5879.09s]  Where's the bomb?
[5879.69s -> 5880.45s]  It's the bomb.
[5881.77s -> 5883.37s]  How long is that on fire for?
[5885.72s -> 5886.44s]  Get over here.
[5886.60s -> 5887.16s]  Where's the bomb?
[5893.32s -> 5893.52s]  Where?
[5895.42s -> 5896.34s]  Oh my God.
[5896.34s -> 5897.50s]  You stupid fucking thing.
[5897.50s -> 5898.90s]  I hate that Nyan cat thing.
[5899.50s -> 5900.62s]  You just ruined everything.
[5902.16s -> 5902.68s]  Where is it now?
[5904.79s -> 5905.39s]  Oh my God.
[5905.39s -> 5906.39s]  Get out of my way.
[5915.24s -> 5915.92s]  Where did it go?
[5921.78s -> 5922.22s]  All right.
[5922.22s -> 5924.60s]  Stop right there.
[5924.64s -> 5926.24s]  It's directly across.
[5926.44s -> 5927.00s]  No, it's not.
[5930.16s -> 5931.52s]  It's a little bit to the left.
[5933.04s -> 5933.56s]  All right, here we go.
[5934.32s -> 5938.78s]  I need to grab the bomb because it's right here.
[5939.18s -> 5940.42s]  It's not directly across.
[5948.02s -> 5948.62s]  Where did it go?
[5948.94s -> 5951.74s]  Did that stupid Nyan cat thing fucking knock it out of the way?
[5952.10s -> 5953.38s]  I hate that thing so much.
[5954.58s -> 5955.50s]  I don't even know where it is now.
[5957.53s -> 5958.37s]  Where did you knock it?
[5967.08s -> 5968.32s]  Well, here's the bomb.
[5970.10s -> 5971.02s]  Oh my, give it to me.
[5971.06s -> 5972.06s]  Oh my God.
[5981.76s -> 5982.88s]  I'm I hate this game.
[5992.90s -> 5994.70s]  Give me my panel back.
[5998.94s -> 6000.38s]  I need one light panel.
[6005.44s -> 6006.28s]  Is it, is it lit?
[6006.48s -> 6006.68s]  All right.
[6006.68s -> 6007.04s]  It's lit.
[6014.84s -> 6015.40s]  What is this?
[6016.00s -> 6016.76s]  This is a purple duck.
[6017.08s -> 6017.64s]  Oh, it's pink.
[6031.40s -> 6032.32s]  Where are you?
[6033.41s -> 6033.65s]  Okay.
[6033.65s -> 6034.25s]  There he is.
[6034.37s -> 6035.09s]  Now, wait a minute.
[6035.99s -> 6037.07s]  Right across here.
[6038.10s -> 6043.27s]  I have to, oh my God.
[6050.15s -> 6050.99s]  This is going to be loud.
[6052.20s -> 6052.92s]  Is that the right spot?
[6054.67s -> 6055.03s]  I got it.
[6061.64s -> 6061.92s]  I got it.
[6061.92s -> 6062.16s]  I got it.
[6062.16s -> 6062.40s]  I got it.
[6062.40s -> 6062.68s]  I got it.
[6062.68s -> 6062.96s]  I got it.
[6065.92s -> 6066.64s]  I love this game.
[6070.53s -> 6070.73s]  Okay.
[6070.73s -> 6074.01s]  Now I can break that open with the big metal duck.
[6077.68s -> 6078.68s]  I have power up somewhere, right?
[6080.40s -> 6081.32s]  Oh, do I need a key?
[6086.98s -> 6087.58s]  Do I need a key?
[6089.40s -> 6090.60s]  You have a negative score.
[6090.80s -> 6100.05s]  I just found out you ate him and this game.
[6101.32s -> 6102.60s]  I didn't even want to click on it.
[6102.60s -> 6104.48s]  The Nyan cat pushed it into me.
[6110.94s -> 6111.82s]  Can I break it?
[6116.23s -> 6118.07s]  Do I actually need a key or could I break it?
[6119.46s -> 6120.70s]  I can definitely break it, right?
[6131.66s -> 6131.90s]  All right.
[6131.94s -> 6132.54s]  Break this.
[6144.39s -> 6148.54s]  I can't skeleton key duck.
[6151.18s -> 6152.34s]  Uh, I already have this.
[6153.10s -> 6153.94s]  I don't have a skeleton anymore.
[6153.94s -> 6155.60s]  Wait, does that actually work?
[6156.76s -> 6157.48s]  Upgrade fire.
[6161.85s -> 6164.31s]  Can't yeah.
[6164.31s -> 6165.23s]  Skeleton became angel.
[6165.51s -> 6170.50s]  I can't leave without, I got it.
[6170.50s -> 6172.18s]  At least I got it.
[6172.42s -> 6173.93s]  I can't not open this.
[6174.49s -> 6176.57s]  This is like the big treasure chest of the game.
[6177.52s -> 6177.88s]  Burn it.
[6184.54s -> 6185.42s]  Upgrade the chest.
[6186.99s -> 6192.05s]  Oh, you need a negative score.
[6193.88s -> 6194.08s]  All right.
[6194.08s -> 6195.08s]  So, all right, all right, all right.
[6195.16s -> 6195.48s]  Let's go.
[6195.48s -> 6195.72s]  Let's go.
[6195.72s -> 6195.96s]  I got it.
[6195.96s -> 6196.24s]  I got it.
[6196.60s -> 6211.01s]  So we have to make a bunch of devil, um, bunch of devils and that will bring my
[6211.01s -> 6211.57s]  score negative.
[6217.59s -> 6218.15s]  Is that accurate?
[6228.55s -> 6228.75s]  All right.
[6228.75s -> 6229.67s]  This is going to take a little while.
[6229.67s -> 6230.99s]  So we're going to put a new OST on.
[6230.99s -> 6232.51s]  Can we get a recommendation?
[6234.39s -> 6237.07s]  Maybe make, can you make the Nyan cat want a devil?
[6249.95s -> 6250.59s]  I'm not sure you can.
[6260.84s -> 6262.16s]  Now I'm not leaving until I open this box.
[6263.06s -> 6264.38s]  This is like the good ending.
[6266.45s -> 6268.17s]  Uh, I'm just going to keep making them.
[6268.95s -> 6269.63s]  Can I upgrade them?
[6279.85s -> 6280.25s]  All right.
[6280.37s -> 6280.97s]  Uh, yeah.
[6280.97s -> 6283.33s]  Mods get a, get a good four choices.
[6292.24s -> 6300.08s]  No, no one's forcing you to play this.
[6300.12s -> 6301.48s]  I, I want to play this.
[6301.88s -> 6303.84s]  That's why I'm playing.
[6308.88s -> 6312.96s]  I not jokingly enough want to see the end.
[6325.46s -> 6326.82s]  Am I, I'm not losing points though.
[6338.78s -> 6340.10s]  Smash the battery again.
[6340.42s -> 6341.98s]  Make a negative battery.
[6347.95s -> 6351.32s]  Uh, it sounds a little too complicated.
[6353.46s -> 6357.03s]  I feel like I have to restart to get to the next part, but I can't.
[6359.42s -> 6363.02s]  I feel like I gained way too many points with the Nyan cat one.
[6366.15s -> 6368.87s]  Cause I'm gonna have to sit here and make a ton of negative scoring ducks and it's
[6368.87s -> 6370.87s]  going to take an hour to reverse it.
[6373.40s -> 6374.20s]  I'm going to give it one more try.
[6376.73s -> 6377.33s]  The runs are ruined.
[6377.33s -> 6377.65s]  It's all right.
[6385.80s -> 6387.64s]  The key is minus 50 K.
[6387.64s -> 6388.00s]  Okay.
[6390.24s -> 6391.32s]  Leaving the lights on this time.
[6397.03s -> 6405.44s]  So this time the goal is to get, just don't break the lights.
[6414.16s -> 6414.56s]  Okay.
[6416.80s -> 6418.64s]  You need to break the lights to get devil duck.
[6419.51s -> 6420.75s]  Oh, that's true.
[6426.96s -> 6428.24s]  You need to break the lights eventually.
[6429.04s -> 6429.88s]  Hmm.
[6434.36s -> 6439.15s]  I think, yeah, I think I can get the wood duck first.
[6439.23s -> 6441.44s]  Get the bomb done out of the way.
[6448.84s -> 6449.08s]  Yeah.
[6449.08s -> 6451.52s]  I'm going to, once I get the chest out, then I can figure that out.
[6456.80s -> 6458.72s]  Bomb will come after the Nyan cat.
[6468.44s -> 6468.56s]  Yeah.
[6468.56s -> 6473.78s]  Trying to not get the Nyan cat to upgrade is the real problem.
[6476.64s -> 6477.40s]  Where can I put this?
[6477.40s -> 6478.80s]  We're just maybe like behind here.
[6478.84s -> 6479.08s]  Okay.
[6479.08s -> 6479.72s]  What if I do this?
[6481.13s -> 6482.01s]  I'm going to make a shield.
[6485.88s -> 6489.28s]  So it'll never, it'll always have to bounce off of this first.
[6489.32s -> 6490.48s]  It's not going to ever go in there.
[6492.27s -> 6493.55s]  We need to make a protective box.
[6495.24s -> 6497.12s]  So now it almost physically can't touch it.
[6499.60s -> 6499.92s]  Okay.
[6507.62s -> 6509.46s]  I'm giving this one more attempt, and then I'm going to open up the
[6509.46s -> 6513.41s]  armored core six tutorial and, um, get very angry.
[6513.77s -> 6514.37s]  I don't think I will.
[6514.41s -> 6514.97s]  I think I'll have fun.
[6522.85s -> 6523.37s]  Okay.
[6524.69s -> 6525.81s]  So what's the order?
[6526.88s -> 6527.32s]  What do you guys think?
[6527.32s -> 6527.84s]  What's the order?
[6529.18s -> 6529.82s]  Wood duck?
[6532.01s -> 6532.97s]  Blow up wall.
[6533.84s -> 6534.76s]  I got to get metal duck.
[6542.52s -> 6543.76s]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[6544.50s -> 6547.26s]  Hide the batteries in the, where the bone duck was.
[6560.76s -> 6561.88s]  Break one light.
[6562.44s -> 6563.60s]  Make a bunch of children.
[6563.80s -> 6566.32s]  Then once you blow up the wall, turn all the lights out to get the
[6566.32s -> 6567.40s]  devil and bounce them around.
[6567.68s -> 6568.52s]  Good idea.
[6568.72s -> 6569.04s]  Actually.
[6569.04s -> 6569.44s]  Great idea.
[6590.74s -> 6591.10s]  Okay.
[6592.52s -> 6593.08s]  That was about right.
[6596.86s -> 6597.06s]  All right.
[6597.06s -> 6598.74s]  We got hot wheels, stunt track coming up.
[6602.97s -> 6606.68s]  Hot wheels, stunt track.
[6607.08s -> 6607.68s]  Oh, S T.
[6607.68s -> 6608.68s]  Is this, what was this for?
[6612.44s -> 6613.36s]  Hot wheels, stunt track.
[6613.89s -> 6614.89s]  Oh, S T.
[6617.81s -> 6618.61s]  I think this is correct.
[6621.06s -> 6622.26s]  Ooh, this sounds pretty good.
[6624.60s -> 6624.96s]  All right.
[6624.96s -> 6625.56s]  I'm into this.
[6632.08s -> 6632.28s]  Cool.
[6644.10s -> 6646.70s]  It's like rubber ducky death metal.
[6657.23s -> 6659.43s]  He's saying all kinds of fucked up shit right now.
[6673.15s -> 6674.35s]  This is not death metal.
[6675.03s -> 6676.43s]  He listened to this death metal.
[6682.26s -> 6683.94s]  You need to open poke stream right now.
[6683.94s -> 6684.86s]  It's very important.
[6686.43s -> 6686.71s]  Why?
[6703.51s -> 6710.07s]  This warlock thing, this warlock, this warlock, this warlock item.
[6715.00s -> 6716.16s]  He's kind of doing it to the beat.
[6719.20s -> 6719.88s]  Oh, keep going.
[6721.16s -> 6721.96s]  You're cooking right now.
[6722.62s -> 6723.42s]  Just keep farming money.
[6723.42s -> 6726.94s]  It's got a lot of gold and we should start investing on items.
[6728.11s -> 6730.99s]  Is it cheating if my viewers send me items and I buy it?
[6731.59s -> 6732.99s]  Respectfully, for a good price.
[6736.75s -> 6738.83s]  Does he have my stream up behind him?
[6743.16s -> 6745.52s]  It sounds like a promo for poke stream.
[6746.97s -> 6749.69s]  Like here's the crazy stuff that poke gets up to.
[6756.32s -> 6757.84s]  Oh, we've been caught.
[6759.60s -> 6761.52s]  Jerma, did you, did you get the ducks or what?
[6761.72s -> 6762.88s]  Yeah, it was awesome.
[6763.44s -> 6765.56s]  I got to a million points and I'm still working.
[6765.56s -> 6771.04s]  I'm still trying to figure out how to, uh, get the box open, which is pretty,
[6771.24s -> 6772.36s]  it's been pretty interesting so far.
[6775.36s -> 6775.52s]  Okay.
[6775.52s -> 6776.48s]  I can't listen to the stream anymore.
[6776.48s -> 6777.68s]  Cause I'm listening to myself three times.
[6779.83s -> 6780.95s]  How do I get the box open?
[6791.47s -> 6792.91s]  I'm stealing your content right here.
[6792.91s -> 6793.99s]  Thanks Jerma for the content.
[6802.51s -> 6804.67s]  He just starts throwing shit in his room.
[6805.19s -> 6808.95s]  That kind of sounded like he's doing his own duck bouncing.
[6808.99s -> 6809.99s]  He's like, Oh, Hey, thanks.
[6809.99s -> 6811.71s]  I got, I got, I got some ideas now.
[6812.07s -> 6814.79s]  He just starts picking up shit in his room, throwing it into the walls.
[6819.98s -> 6820.90s]  All right, let's keep going.
[6834.56s -> 6835.16s]  Hold on a second.
[6835.44s -> 6836.04s]  This is important.
[6839.47s -> 6842.83s]  Let's see if we can get ourselves up on the, don't, don't say anything to poke.
[6879.24s -> 6880.00s]  You're sweating.
[6898.52s -> 6901.08s]  I was not sweating this much when I played Elden Ring.
[6902.64s -> 6904.52s]  It's just my right arm too.
[6904.72s -> 6907.76s]  My left arm, my left underarm is perfectly fine.
[6907.76s -> 6908.96s]  Holy shit.
[6910.01s -> 6910.37s]  All right.
[6910.37s -> 6911.05s]  Well, that was fun.
[6913.77s -> 6914.01s]  All right.
[6914.01s -> 6914.25s]  All right.
[6914.29s -> 6916.25s]  Stay with the, uh, stay with the, what I was doing.
[6920.17s -> 6921.33s]  What did I get behind him?
[6928.76s -> 6930.56s]  Was that, did I get to be on the screen behind him?
[6931.66s -> 6931.94s]  Good.
[6931.98s -> 6932.42s]  Was it good?
[6937.02s -> 6939.54s]  He's in the middle of like a hard fight in dark and darker.
[6939.54s -> 6940.62s]  And I'm just sitting there behind him.
[6942.27s -> 6943.71s]  I just start smoking behind him.
[6946.96s -> 6947.16s]  Hold on.
[6947.16s -> 6947.72s]  Here's the clip.
[6947.84s -> 6948.16s]  Hold on.
[6948.40s -> 6948.80s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[6948.80s -> 6949.28s]  This is important.
[6949.28s -> 6949.76s]  I want to see this.
[6954.50s -> 6955.10s]  Where's the clip.
[6967.35s -> 6968.27s]  I got to get this on.
[6968.79s -> 6969.47s]  Hold on a sec.
[6977.22s -> 6977.58s]  We got it.
[6977.58s -> 6978.86s]  We got to get this on the big screen.
[6978.86s -> 6979.14s]  Hold on.
[6985.15s -> 6986.23s]  Oh, where is it?
[6988.27s -> 6988.87s]  Okay.
[6989.72s -> 6990.20s]  Here we go.
[7004.25s -> 7004.81s]  All right, here we go.
[7004.81s -> 7005.21s]  Let's see.
[7014.07s -> 7015.51s]  Did your name's a bad look for me, man.
[7015.79s -> 7016.63s]  I'm just going to say it right now.
[7027.16s -> 7028.00s]  I don't know him.
[7033.02s -> 7034.22s]  That's so stupid.
[7034.54s -> 7035.06s]  I love it.
[7035.58s -> 7036.46s]  He's flipping me off.
[7037.66s -> 7039.10s]  Oh, you can see him like pull out.
[7044.28s -> 7045.44s]  Oh, that's great.
[7047.49s -> 7049.05s]  Oh, that's, I love that.
[7049.25s -> 7049.89s]  That was amazing.
[7055.55s -> 7055.87s]  Okay.
[7056.79s -> 7061.21s]  So, uh, let's get back to the game.
[7068.31s -> 7068.67s]  What was that?
[7068.67s -> 7070.19s]  What was the, I want to know what, what was I doing?
[7071.00s -> 7071.76s]  I forget what I was doing.
[7072.44s -> 7073.00s]  Back to business.
[7073.00s -> 7073.20s]  Yeah.
[7073.36s -> 7073.60s]  Yeah.
[7073.64s -> 7073.84s]  All right.
[7073.84s -> 7074.20s]  Back to this.
[7075.26s -> 7076.70s]  He stayed full screen after that.
[7076.70s -> 7077.54s]  Cause he was in the middle of it.
[7082.78s -> 7083.62s]  Oh, I need the music.
[7084.36s -> 7086.08s]  Can't just have no music on what's going on here.
[7096.22s -> 7096.58s]  Okay.
[7098.04s -> 7102.24s]  So stay with the plan.
[7115.28s -> 7117.20s]  I'm doing this and I'm, I, this is it.
[7118.37s -> 7124.28s]  I'm having fun with this, but I want to do this tutorial in armored
[7124.28s -> 7125.36s]  core and then turn my stream off.
[7139.14s -> 7140.22s]  The battery in the corner.
[7140.26s -> 7140.78s]  Yo.
[7140.78s -> 7141.02s]  Yup.
[7141.02s -> 7141.18s]  Yup.
[7141.18s -> 7141.34s]  Yup.
[7141.34s -> 7141.50s]  Yup.
[7141.50s -> 7141.70s]  Yup.
[7142.38s -> 7142.94s]  Oh, yup.
[7159.62s -> 7164.31s]  We do not want that Nyan duck to touch this.
[7164.31s -> 7165.31s]  Hopefully this is a good spot.
[7170.40s -> 7177.64s]  We need the metal duck yet.
[7177.64s -> 7178.56s]  Wooden duck right now.
[7179.16s -> 7182.82s]  Um, wouldn't, what was the process to get wooden duck?
[7182.82s -> 7183.50s]  I need to break this.
[7183.50s -> 7184.02s]  Let me break it.
[7185.16s -> 7185.32s]  Wait.
[7185.32s -> 7186.60s]  I can't break that without metal duck.
[7187.51s -> 7188.27s]  I think I have to keep going.
[7192.25s -> 7192.77s]  Ah, that's right.
[7192.77s -> 7193.13s]  It's a button.
[7193.25s -> 7193.61s]  Thank you.
[7193.77s -> 7194.17s]  Appreciate it.
[7205.86s -> 7206.26s]  Oh my God.
[7206.26s -> 7206.78s]  I've lost it.
[7207.10s -> 7207.86s]  Lost my touch here.
[7215.48s -> 7216.60s]  Looking good so far.
[7219.77s -> 7235.92s]  So now, now I just need to get enough points to get, uh, you know,
[7256.80s -> 7260.67s]  that's just putting up like fucking like Lord of the Rings.
[7263.21s -> 7264.41s]  Would we both get banned?
[7284.09s -> 7284.45s]  Okay.
[7285.10s -> 7286.14s]  I think we're close.
[7288.15s -> 7288.35s]  All right.
[7288.35s -> 7292.80s]  Do not bounce into the corner at all.
[7297.20s -> 7298.04s]  We're going to continue.
[7298.72s -> 7299.40s]  What do you mean ruined?
[7299.44s -> 7299.68s]  What?
[7303.57s -> 7304.61s]  Upgrade the normal duck.
[7305.33s -> 7306.05s]  Guard the corner.
[7306.25s -> 7307.81s]  No, it is this it's blocked over there.
[7308.84s -> 7309.04s]  Okay.
[7309.04s -> 7311.56s]  We have to, we got to hurry up because we need to start.
[7311.56s -> 7313.48s]  We need to, we need the blue duck.
[7316.36s -> 7317.64s]  Then we got to get rid of all the lights.
[7334.53s -> 7335.09s]  Did I fuck it up?
[7341.40s -> 7342.12s]  Don't break this.
[7344.59s -> 7346.27s]  What poke stream in your corner?
[7347.70s -> 7350.87s]  I can't, I can't do that.
[7355.69s -> 7356.57s]  You just broke it.
[7357.85s -> 7359.85s]  I'm paying attention to too many things right now.
[7362.17s -> 7364.01s]  I, I need the blue duck.
[7364.05s -> 7365.33s]  I'm, I'm going with what I know.
[7374.32s -> 7376.60s]  His Sims queue is full right now.
[7376.92s -> 7378.36s]  You, that is a good way to put it.
[7378.36s -> 7378.84s]  Seriously.
[7381.77s -> 7383.05s]  Actually a great way to put it.
[7384.32s -> 7385.16s]  Did we get that way though?
[7385.24s -> 7385.68s]  Honestly?
[7385.80s -> 7386.60s]  No, like joking around.
[7390.52s -> 7390.72s]  Okay.
[7390.72s -> 7397.29s]  Here comes now the strategy that that chatter said, don't you dare touch that.
[7421.47s -> 7422.67s]  You cannot upgrade the wooden one.
[7422.67s -> 7425.56s]  Unfortunately, it's not upgradeable.
[7431.55s -> 7432.59s]  I think I need like 5,000.
[7448.04s -> 7450.08s]  What pokes webcam on your stream?
[7453.22s -> 7463.41s]  Oh, but that would mean poke would have to be full cam for me to do that.
[7467.56s -> 7470.04s]  Hey, we'd have to be full cam pretending to play this game.
[7471.29s -> 7472.33s]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[7473.09s -> 7474.97s]  No, poke is, is playing dark and dark.
[7474.97s -> 7475.81s]  He's probably having a good time.
[7478.67s -> 7479.15s]  Crop it.
[7479.15s -> 7485.22s]  So you can crop it.
[7490.82s -> 7491.78s]  Now you've got me.
[7491.82s -> 7493.14s]  Now you got me interested.
[7494.44s -> 7495.20s]  All right.
[7495.20s -> 7495.88s]  Hold on.
[7495.92s -> 7496.84s]  This is going to take a minute.
[7496.84s -> 7497.92s]  Don't tell him we're doing this.
[7497.92s -> 7501.48s]  I know you, you guys are going to just, you guys are going to rat us out.
[7502.00s -> 7522.84s]  Okay.
[7522.84s -> 7523.56s]  This is going to take a second.
[7523.56s -> 7524.36s]  Cause I'm going to crop it.
[7524.48s -> 7538.88s]  Well, you know, try to stop talking to, don't tell him I'm going to stop talking
[7538.88s -> 7541.60s]  to, this is going to be actually fucking hilarious.
[7541.96s -> 7542.56s]  Hold on a second.
[7550.87s -> 7553.15s]  Nobody blow this because this might be very funny.
[7554.92s -> 7556.20s]  He's going to be talking about the game.
[7556.24s -> 7558.36s]  His game is going to be like, what is he talking about?
[7560.07s -> 7560.47s]  Okay.
[7560.55s -> 7561.03s]  Hold on.
[7561.35s -> 7566.82s]  You need this to be bigger.
[7572.47s -> 7572.95s]  Turn it up.
[7577.75s -> 7578.71s]  I have to do this quick.
[7578.71s -> 7580.91s]  Cause the background in his stream is going to change.
[7587.89s -> 7588.37s]  Okay.
[7588.37s -> 7590.85s]  Where is this?
[7597.74s -> 7597.98s]  Shit.
[7597.98s -> 7598.66s]  That's not the right one.
[7602.16s -> 7602.52s]  Okay.
[7603.47s -> 7604.23s]  Give me a sec.
[7612.45s -> 7614.09s]  It's important that nobody blows this.
[7619.10s -> 7619.74s]  Keep chilling.
[7620.26s -> 7621.06s]  You guys are doing great.
[7621.26s -> 7622.14s]  You guys are doing great.
[7626.67s -> 7627.91s]  You guys are doing great right now.
[7627.91s -> 7628.43s]  Just hold on.
[7648.32s -> 7648.68s]  Where is he?
[7675.45s -> 7676.25s]  Rat pendant.
[7676.29s -> 7677.85s]  I'm going to go for it one time, guys.
[7679.89s -> 7681.93s]  Wait, isn't rat resourcefulness?
[7682.25s -> 7683.61s]  This could be very useless, right?
[7685.00s -> 7686.80s]  Resourcefulness could be very useless.
[7687.87s -> 7689.91s]  Wait, resourcefulness is that right guys?
[7694.00s -> 7694.28s]  Yeah.
[7694.28s -> 7695.76s]  It's probably the worst one too.
[7697.15s -> 7701.86s]  But what if it's at a 900 gold, 900 gold?
[7702.90s -> 7703.34s]  Oh shit.
[7703.34s -> 7704.50s]  My food's here, guys.
[7705.44s -> 7708.24s]  I gotta go to a laughing face.
[7712.81s -> 7713.57s]  I look at my food.
[7724.84s -> 7725.12s]  Oh shit.
[7725.12s -> 7725.64s]  I can't move.
[7725.92s -> 7727.80s]  Oh, he's getting food.
[7741.72s -> 7742.60s]  He's getting food.
[7742.64s -> 7743.44s]  We can't move.
[7744.00s -> 7745.32s]  Wait, the face cam's not even right.
[7745.44s -> 7745.68s]  Fuck.
[7745.68s -> 7746.00s]  Hold on.
[7746.16s -> 7761.61s]  I got McDonald's.
[7766.00s -> 7766.76s]  I turn off the blue.
[7767.20s -> 7769.52s]  Don't never buy no weed from the gas station, bro.
[7769.88s -> 7770.20s]  Wow.
[7770.20s -> 7771.76s]  45 months in the pond.
[7771.76s -> 7772.60s]  Love you, man.
[7783.02s -> 7784.30s]  Hey, when does he notice though?
[7788.02s -> 7788.94s]  Hope he's making coffee.
[7792.00s -> 7792.92s]  Okay.
[7806.72s -> 7807.64s]  Wait, what's going on here?
[7812.60s -> 7813.04s]  What?
[7815.74s -> 7816.62s]  Wait, what's going on here?
[7819.86s -> 7820.46s]  Yo, what?
[7821.61s -> 7821.93s]  What?
[7825.52s -> 7829.40s]  I, uh, so I think what's going on with the, you know what?
[7830.38s -> 7831.46s]  I think it was bugged for a second.
[7831.46s -> 7832.10s]  Did you guys see that?
[7833.37s -> 7835.05s]  There's probably internet, something going on with the internet.
[7835.29s -> 7838.33s]  I, uh, heard that there's like an internet, like Ross thing today.
[7839.39s -> 7842.31s]  There's like a, like a cross, like some wires or something today.
[7845.56s -> 7846.52s]  Guys, well, we got food.
[7846.52s -> 7851.16s]  So let's just react to Derma now while we have eat food, but to react to my
[7851.16s -> 7852.48s]  favorite streamer and eat food.
[7852.48s -> 7860.74s]  And what, while we have like a little bit, like a little bit, but to react
[7860.74s -> 7873.66s]  to my favorite streamer, while we have like a little bit, what's happening?
[7886.94s -> 7890.76s]  Is he, was it me on his computer?
[7895.20s -> 7895.88s]  I can't hear him.
[7895.88s -> 7896.24s]  Talk.
[7896.24s -> 7896.84s]  Is it bug?
[7896.84s -> 7900.61s]  Is he, is it me on his computer?
[7905.05s -> 7905.73s]  I can't hear him.
[7905.77s -> 7906.89s]  Oh, is it buggy?
[7908.60s -> 7910.00s]  No, I just got to hit this duck more.
[7910.04s -> 7910.72s]  That's all I got to do.
[7911.80s -> 7912.92s]  We're just doing this duck thing.
[7912.92s -> 7916.40s]  And if this, if I restart one more time and get this battery hitting this, uh,
[7917.24s -> 7919.88s]  that, that duck thing, you know, it's going to piss me off more.
[7919.88s -> 7921.20s]  That's all I got to get this right.
[7921.24s -> 7922.80s]  Duck here, guys, duck thing.
[7922.80s -> 7926.24s]  And if this, if I restart one more time and get this battery hitting this, uh,
[7927.04s -> 7929.68s]  that, that duck thing, you know, it's going to piss me off more.
[7929.72s -> 7931.00s]  That's all I got to get this right.
[7931.04s -> 7932.60s]  Duck here, guys, duck thing.
[7932.68s -> 7935.76s]  And if this, if I restart one more time and get the battery hitting this.
[7935.80s -> 7939.16s]  Uh, that, that duck thing, you know, it's going to piss me off.
[7942.60s -> 7949.32s]  I feel really strong about this in my, uh, my arms hurt.
[7949.48s -> 7950.72s]  I've been a sore.
[7952.12s -> 7953.16s]  I've been sore.
[7953.16s -> 7956.68s]  And, uh, I've just, you know, yeah.
[7956.68s -> 7962.56s]  Oh, yeah, I've been just really sad about what is going on in the community of us
[7963.08s -> 7966.60s]  You know, but it's okay. We can get through this. I
[7967.16s -> 7969.52s]  Don't even know if he's hearing me right now
[7969.68s -> 7976.62s]  my butt
[7976.62s -> 7983.57s]  with enough time guys, we can get through this duck stuff and
[7986.09s -> 7987.37s]  I am
[7987.37s -> 7991.36s]  Gonna address the swollen balls allegations very soon
[7991.96s -> 8012.19s]  Jerma, what are you doing?
[8013.07s -> 8022.72s]  I don't know. I just kind of went off the rails. I'm sorry. I just want to eat my food man. I'm sorry
[8022.72s -> 8024.72s]  It's just kind of went off the rails
[8026.61s -> 8031.85s]  You got McDonald's though, enjoy your McDonald's I love McDonald's
[8034.97s -> 8046.94s]  All right, I closed a spring let's finish this out now the game is really fun poke
