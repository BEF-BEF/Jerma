[0.63s -> 38.55s]  What's up? How's everybody doing? How are you? Good afternoon. Here comes illegal movie night. Nope, that's not even correct. We're gonna go we'll talk about it right now. I should probably wait. I've only been live for about 60 seconds. You gotta wait for people to come in. I'm fucking I'm excited today. I'm full I'm full of vitamin D today. Now just be clear. Just the sun was just in my face. Like 15 minutes. Now I just I could just find the vitamin D is flowing through my body. I was just I was there was a shade open. I just stood there and just let the sun hit me
[38.55s -> 84.87s]  in the face through the window. I feel great. We can tell he's a what he's a photosynth he's a photosynthesis streamer. That's probably true. I'm at the peak. The height of my energy. When the sun is at its hottest. And at its complete and total apex. I definitely I'm probably made I'm probably part plant. Yeah, I'm like 40% human 25% dog 10% goldfish.
[85.11s -> 124.06s]  And then to one. Hi, how are you can see? And probably like, I don't know, 18% humidity. And then maybe three or 4% of lily or something. That makes sense. Definitely not a cactus. I drink too much water. I gotta move this. I gotta move this thing. I mean, and I will. I'm gonna get this on like a big I'm gonna get like a professional streamer hook. You know, those things that come down, like the old like 1980s radio stations, the thing that hangs down in front of people's faces.
[124.10s -> 150.62s]  I'm gonna get one of those. So I never like elbow you in the head of her again. I can't believe you won't finish beautiful Joe. It's all right. You take your losses and you take your wins. Beautiful Joe was a loss for me. It's okay. I have the second one too. I was like, people are gonna love this.
[150.62s -> 188.11s]  People are gonna love beautiful Joe man. Beautiful Joe one, I got beautiful Joe too. People are gonna be clamoring for this. Exactly. They can't wait for beautiful Joe too. I got 40 minutes into beautiful Joe one. And it was like you guys would, you guys were beaten up by it. And I keep talking about this too. I keep talking about beautiful Joe. This is like day three in a row where I've talked about beautiful Joe. So this is it. We're not gonna talk about beautiful Joe anymore. This is where it ends.
[188.11s -> 222.46s]  Okay, but let's go over what's gonna happen next week. I've got a plan for next week. We've got the whole thing locked out. Are you ready? So starting on Tuesday, Tuesday is going to be the movie night. So what's movie night? What do you mean? What are you talking about? We talked last night and a couple nights ago, we went over it. I was going to try the twitch prime movie watch party thing. But I looked at it. I looked at what was on the watch party as like 15 movies and then 40 or 50.
[222.70s -> 223.18s]  Amazon TV shows that they desperately want people to watch. Like, like Jack Russell, whatever it was. What's that show? Jack Russell? No, that's a dog. What? What's the show that like Amazon wants everybody to watch so bad? Jack Ryan. Okay. Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to watch Jack Ryan. That's it. It's like Jack Ryan. And then like seven movies. So until they fill that catalog up with hopefully a bugs life at some point, we're going to watch a public domain movie on Tuesday. We might even watch two depending on how long they are. So Monday,
[260.90s -> 297.22s]  it's going to be public domain movie night. And there is the watch party on twitch right now is only for people in the United States. You have to have Amazon prime, you know, twitch prime. And maybe in the future, we'll try it out. But I do want to try it eventually. But we're going to do public domain movies. So tonight, after Casino Wink, we're going to go back to Casino Wink because I want to play it again, because I think it was really fun. After we're done with that, after maybe a few hours, we're going to spend a little time. We're going to pick some of some of our top picks for public domain
[297.22s -> 340.66s]  movie. And that's the plan. So Tuesday's public domain movie night, Wednesday is going to be community content night. There we go. Future me does not now have to go back and go, what? Oh, I didn't know. I'm holding future me accountable. Wednesday is going to be community content night. Thursday will be mystery game and throw mystery game in there. And then Friday, Friday is going to be the Easy Bake Oven stream. Hopefully all the things that I need will be available for it. That's the plan. Plan is to have Friday be the Easy Bake Oven stream. If Friday cannot be the
[340.66s -> 387.26s]  Easy Bake Oven stream, if for some reason it's not ready, then it'll just be on Saturday or Sunday. It's going to happen this weekend. I'm looking forward to it. Why does somebody just say we to do? Does that make any sense? Oh, because I said the word bake. Right, right, right. Today is Friday. Yeah, I'm talking about like for next week. Movie night, community content night, mystery game, Easy Bake Oven is your plan for next week. But for now, we're going to go back into Casino Wink. And the reason why I was going to think about doing a movie
[387.26s -> 403.20s]  tonight, like I was going to do it tonight, but I don't want to rush through Casino Wink. I feel like there's at least a few more hours of stuff that I want to see. I'm having fun with it. I don't want to put this. Oh, I got to, I got to hurry the fuck up and get off Casino Wink because we got to watch that movie.
[405.02s -> 423.11s]  So Tuesday is going to be the movie, maybe even two. We'll find out. We'll figure it out tonight. So let's see how much more stuff there is to do in Casino Wink. I those of you that missed it, we're going to pick up where we left off. I'm going to try
[423.15s -> 443.05s]  to stop the bleeding. I'm going to try to stop the the never ending money drain. I'm going to try to get a second property and we're going to make the second property, the Chuck E. Cheese. Because then I can, I don't have to, I don't have to delete anything. I'm going to try.
[443.05s -> 487.19s]  So without further ado, let's get started. We're not going to get something called Chuck E. Cheese. It's going to be like a Chuck E. Cheese styled restaurant. It's going to be arcade games. It's going to be pizzas. And I'm going to permanently have a Rhino on staff to walk around and be the Charles E. Rhino. Whatever the, whatever the Chuck E.'s name is. It's Chuck E. Cheese. It's Charles Cheese. That's the name of the rat. Of course it is. What am I talking about? Let's go. We have to make sure this is getting captured. Doesn't look like it is. Let's try this. Oh, there it is. All right. So which one of these
[487.19s -> 536.36s]  is right? His name is Charles Entertainment Cheese. That's so funny. All right. Which one? This one is 1646. This one is 1728. No. Wait, what? How was this? February 7th, 1970. Oh, right. That's the date in the game. All right. Which we're not doing this auto save. We're going to do from here. We're going to see where we were. There's a clown convention coming in. The window is too big. Hold that thought. Let me fix it. There you go. All right. So where we left
[536.36s -> 551.09s]  off was there was a problem. There was a, there was, I had a problem with one of my chefs. I got rid of him. He was, he was removed from the company. The doorman was a, there was a problem with the doorman. He was also removed from the company. And then we ended up here. Okay.
[552.76s -> 567.30s]  No, it is no longer a puke casino. It's actually fairly clean, but we had a lot of people leave the company recently. And there was a restaurant problem. Don't ever get into the restaurant business. It's just a never ending hole that you put money into. It's just don't ever make a
[567.30s -> 591.45s]  restaurant. There's no, don't do it. It was a hotel. All right. Here we go. I need $44,000. We need to go over our staff. This hotel makes a lot of money. $21,000. I got fined twice by the police for having too many prostitutes. And then for having too many fights, which I changed that.
[591.45s -> 605.06s]  Oh, there's no sound. I got it. Um, I fixed that by making the drinks, not $3. That helped, I think. So now let's take a look at our staff. What do we need?
[609.10s -> 637.05s]  Fuck. I can't collect. No, no, no, we're not. No, I can't do it. Just imagine this there. Put it on your screen and like look at it over on the, on like another window every few minutes. Hold on. Wait, I can't. I'll tab right now. Just hold on a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This guy's making $240. Do it now. I'll do it later when I have a minute.
[638.17s -> 676.17s]  Just hold on. The hotel is doing fine. I need to go down to the second floor. We got to figure out what I want to do here. Okay, so who needs to stay? We have, you guys are still here. This is the burger factory and the ice cream factory. The bar. There's two bartenders that don't need to be here. There's only no, there's only here. The last thing that happened. Okay, the last thing happened was I accidentally. There's a convention starting. Okay, biker. No clowns. Oh, yes. I remember. Yeah, I asked the Garfield accidentally shot one of the technicians. I now remember.
[676.17s -> 724.52s]  Okay, so we need a new technician here. Seinfeld. Oh, okay. We need a technician, a cheap one. You can get to work. We only need one. There's not very many machines that are really in operation. All the waitstaff can go. We have to get rid of the waitstaff. We do. There's no, there's nothing. There's no, I don't know. Restaurant. There's no, nobody here. We have to wait till people actually start coming back to the casino. Just, just get rid of all the hookers that come in. Do I have any other counselors? I don't think I do. I don't. Just get rid of. Okay, you. Don't shoot him.
[724.52s -> 769.61s]  Just get rid of them. Eject. Every time I shoot somebody, I lose an hour of progress. Okay, people are starting to come back. We're not going to do that anymore. We're going to slowly build our empire back up to like, I make money and then I'm going to make a Chuck E. Cheese. It's going to be slots and lanes too. And there's no slot machines in the whole place. Okay, looking all right so far. Now what else do we need? Let me look at the staff menu again. Cashier wants more money. Where are you? Up here with the sports betting. Um.
[769.61s -> 810.97s]  City average is 36 bucks. Should I really give this person like five times what the city's average is? Just get. Get out of here. This is the dealer. You want five times. You want like at least twice double what everybody. You're a five star dealer. I have to keep you around. I have to keep the five star dealer around. Don't shoot him. Oh yeah, right. I shot him last time. Don't, just don't shoot him. Just get rid of him. I know they're asking for a raise. Don't shoot him. We have a second chance here.
[810.97s -> 856.31s]  Just fire detective curvy, whatever his name is. Goodbye. You're no longer working for the company. The doorman's not happy either. 95 dollars. I'm sorry. I'm doing it right now. And then we'll give a bonus to everybody that gets a bonus. All of you. Of two dollars. That's enough. Now let's go. No, I'm not going to blast him. We need to, we need to build our customers back up. All right, this wall is fucking with everybody's brains apparently. Okay, get, just delete it. No one's even using it anyways. We can have something else over here.
[856.31s -> 906.42s]  Well, I know, you know, this is more room for gambling. Yeah, get rid of these tables. I'm sorry. The whole waitstaff has to go. Where are you going? I don't have enough money. They have to go. No more waitstaff. I know. I know. I know the person. Okay. So the person making 270 dollars quadruple what everybody else is making. Sees somebody gets fired and goes, Oh no, I'll die. No, you just fired that person. Now you, therefore you freed up more money to pay me. Are you fucking kidding me? Unbelievable. I'm, it's, I know you're a five star dealer,
[906.42s -> 947.96s]  but there has to be somebody at the table. All right. Sorry. Ike is going to be losing. All right. 290 bucks. That's good. Okay. Here we are. We're doing all right. It's not bad now. We still have an opportunity. So we got to bring in some more customers. I got rid of a lot of, uh, overhead here. I got 24,000. This casino blows laughing my ass up. Yeah, it does. Because I had to do, I had to get rid of a bunch of shit because I had to delete a bunch of stuff because I wasn't making any money.
[947.96s -> 1005.82s]  And four people were killed. Do you understand that? I'm trying. Here we go. Sit at this poker table. I got to come sit over here and play. I wish they would keep the noise down. How am I supposed to do that? Wait. Now you keep it. Now he's had causing a disturbance. Is it unlike the slot machine sounds? Get out. No, he don't get out. Go play one of these slot machines. There you go. There you go. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Okay.

[2231.30s -> 2261.98s]  Everyone loves the poker tables. They're the best in the city. They really like this dealer. You're so expensive though. My God. She's expensive but she's keeping everybody at this table. You on the other hand, nobody is playing for more than five seconds. Check this guy out.
[2261.98s -> 2319.80s]  The best poker in town. Slots in lane. That's right. Slamming. Well, sorry. Let me correct you there. It's slamming slots in lane. You need to Garfield her. Alright, we're going to have to. I'm going to have to do something here. We're going to have to do something. Just hold on. I have to change something. We're pretty dire right now. We need customers. So we need customers. Just don't serve me. Oh no. Another fire. Add pasta Italiano.
[2319.80s -> 2358.50s]  Can you imagine? There's five chefs. I would never eat at this restaurant. Can you imagine eating at pasta Italiano when there's a fire once every four days? This shit better be almost free to eat here. This guy's still cooking. Wait a minute. Why are you still cooking? I've got to taste the soup. No, it's not ready. Another few minutes.
[2358.50s -> 2361.92s]  Nate, you got to get out of here. No, no, it's been simmering for 24 hours. Okay, fine. 26,000 turning up the heat, turning up the heat. Fire done. That's kind of very low brain way to say that. Fire done. Hotel. Look at this. Hotels. I should just do only hotels. $20,000 in profit. Are you kidding me? I should have just done
[2436.15s -> 2475.22s]  your cheat just got back with some loot. Nice. 29,000. Why should why did I make a second floor for the casino? Why did I make this hotel? What the fuck is wrong with me? I'm not losing money. I'm up to 30,000. All right, here is the here's the moron play. The moron play is to just turn floor two into a hotel, right? Just get rid of all this shit and turn floor two into a hotel. That means we lose porn theater, but we might need to. Well, guys,
[2475.22s -> 2512.42s]  when I get my third property, we'll eventually just make a porn house. We'll just make like a pornographic building. There's like two porn theaters. There's like a porn show. I can separate it here. Okay, time for renovations. Sports betting does make a lot of profit, though. I'm going to move this downstairs. It was a good spot for it. Sports betting does really, really, really well. Right here. Right in this corner. Get rid of the lava lamp. Sports betting is going in the corner. Save it. Good idea.
[2519.61s -> 2523.35s]  Making moves. All your profit is from the second floor. Yeah, but if I if I have another hotel and I can make this potentially a two star hotel on top of the one star hotel, which that's I mean, I that's kind of a dumb idea. But just have five floors and have floor two be one, two and then three and then four star hotel. I mean, yeah, they all have to go in the same elevator. But who the fuck cares? You don't have to go on the top floor. Like, are you really going to be
[2554.33s -> 2570.36s]  I guess like the guy that's been spent $500 a room that's in like the business suit on on some business trip is and is it going to be bad that there's like free crack heads in the elevator with them for the room that's like $25 a night? Probably.
[2571.16s -> 2574.88s]  Oh, fuck that guy. Who cares? I'm making money. Let's go.
[2574.88s -> 2581.75s]  Fuck whatever. OK, here we go. It's $30,000, but I don't need it. We're going to move the sports betting. You saw where I was going to do. We're going to sell this lava lamp. It's there for no reason. And let's move the sports betting downstairs. Perfect. OK, it is now downstairs. Sports betting is now in the corner. Now let's go back up here. You have a job downstairs. That's right. We're going to get rid of the bowling alley, wait for her to pay and I'll let her
[2630.75s -> 2647.23s]  play for a one fucking ball. Thanks for coming, Sally. You are now fired. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. We'll let the point. Well, OK, we'll let the porn theater run for like in a few minutes because these people are going to stay in here.
[2648.55s -> 2674.10s]  Sally, Lili. Wait, can Sally Lili do anything downstairs? What's available downstairs for Sally? Anything? Can we give Sally a job somehow? What's a job that Sally can do? I don't have one at the porn hotel. Keep the porn theater. I have no room for it.
[2676.53s -> 2689.12s]  It can't go up here. It's too big. What am I supposed to put the porn theater? Should I get rid of roulette? Get rid of OK. Should I get rid of unprofitable blackjack and put porn theater over here?
[2692.96s -> 2710.62s]  No one's going to, but people aren't going to even want to go there. I'll try it. No, that's so awful. Fine. OK, I'm going to go right here. In fact, we're going to move these slots. OK, wait till she spends all of her money.
[2710.62s -> 2764.67s]  Where can I put it? The porn theater. I don't want to move it yet. They're still watching. This is remember this is like this. It's twenty five dollars per movie and the movies have 10 seconds long. This is seventy five dollars a minute. I gotta wait till this is empty. All right, let's get a janitor up here to clean this shit up because I mean, look at this. This is a mess. Travis, you're doing a very good job, Travis. Can I say Travis is three dollars because Travis has never complained about any money or anything. All Travis has done is just do a good fucking job. All right, let them stay in here for a minute and then we're going to get OK.
[2764.99s -> 2767.06s]  All these chairs. I'm getting there. I'm getting the forty four. I didn't do anything drastic. I'm just going to make another hotel. All right. We're clearing out. All right. You two. You're going to have to leave. I'm going to move the movie theater downstairs. Get out. Can I clean this? Could we like spray the floor with a hose? It's the end of the day. We need to like spray this whole thing down with a hose. All right. So that has to move over here. I put it into storage. I got to store this for now. Clean this all up. Get this guy out of here. I'm going to make this. I'm going to make this a another one star hotel.
[2825.10s -> 2881.79s]  Or a two star hotel. I made twelve thousand in profit. Doing good. A two star. Can I afford a two star hotel? All right. I don't want to. Let's move the roulette table over here. You can sit down. No, you don't. OK, move the roulette table. We need to make room for the porn theater and just move this right here. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there is all right. OK. And then we move these and we should have enough room. Get these in this corner. Nice.
[2881.79s -> 2900.47s]  Wait till he's done. OK, I got all day. This lack of symmetry. Symmetricity is pitiful. This is temporary until I get everything done. Don't you understand? I was going to sell the porn theater, not move it downstairs.
[2901.64s -> 2935.76s]  Convention. A hippie convention will start soon. All right. Get off. Let's go into storage. Movie theater. This is so bad. Like right here. But that like sucks. Oh, that's so ugly.
[2940.59s -> 2960.52s]  Move the slots. Maybe I should just sell those slots and put it over here. It's got to go. It's got to go like in that in the corner like this or like this. Right. It has to put a wall around it.
[2965.89s -> 2993.85s]  These aren't making any money. Just get rid of them. It's going in this corner. There we go. Like that. There. Let's make it 20 bucks a movie.
[2995.86s -> 3020.70s]  And we need a cashier with this review of the sports betting. You are not. Come here. You now work there. Oh, there was a spot for her. Look where she sat. Look, Sally Delaney. She does have a job. That's good. OK, let's start running that movie theater again. Back to upstairs.
[3024.95s -> 3038.71s]  I want to move these. They're ugly and in the way. Plus, I don't want this in a way where people can like watch that. I could also want to put I should put a wall right here, too, like a right with the beanbag chairs in front of the bar.
[3048.88s -> 3056.65s]  Imagine that to sit there and just to have a for. All right, let's go to the third second floor. All trash has been removed.
[3058.00s -> 3088.36s]  Scratch that. We've got to remove one more person upstairs and eject this hooker and then I'm converting this to a hotel. See how expensive this would be. All right. Get him out of here, please. Just do a bunch of movie theaters. No, there's not enough people at the forty four thousand first. How much does this cost? Just do it first.
[3088.50s -> 3102.00s]  We have a very important decision I need to make. Garfield, come on, really? He just walked right by you. You were in the same elevator. It's starting to fill up.
[3102.00s -> 3133.57s]  Eject and then eject her, too. I think she's leaving, but no, she's not. Eject. Get out. Leave. The janitor's not really doing a whole lot, but it's OK. Go empty that trash can. It's 52 percent full.
[3134.07s -> 3147.85s]  I need, like, a place to sit on, too. I'm going to put, like, a table, a couch or something. How are people going to eat? This is doing pretty well.
[3150.62s -> 3169.24s]  Travis needs a break. He is doing it. He is on a break. He's on an almost permanent break right now. Where are my cheats? How happy is everybody there? Everyone all right?
[3169.74s -> 3177.63s]  You guys could use a little bit of a bonus. How about 10 bucks? How about 136 dollars a day?
[3177.63s -> 3203.28s]  We have a puke. How are the drinks doing? Good. We're starting to fill up. People are starting to actually remember that we were the cheaper, nicer, more porn-filled casino than any other casino in the area.
[3204.14s -> 3232.93s]  They're starting to remember now. He's losing a lot of money. More throwing up. OK, why? What's the food? Holy shit! How is charging 8 dollars for a 1 dollar hamburger?
[3233.93s -> 3245.14s]  Oh my god! OK, that's why. How are the drinks? The drinks are OK, right? Charge a little more for that, please.
[3249.97s -> 3260.00s]  Stadium food prices. Yeah, I know. Are people using this? Yeah, kind of.
[3265.54s -> 3281.08s]  All right, banking high roller. Go play roulette. I wish I could sit down and play. I wish I could sit down and play at my own casino with my money. Check him out.
[3281.58s -> 3311.51s]  44. All right. No, I lost it. How do I lose a thousand dollars? Someone's cheating somewhere. Where am I losing this much money? 42,000. OK. No, I think somebody's hit a jackpot. That's all. Yeah, somebody hit a jackpot. We're good.
[3312.51s -> 3331.35s]  OK, good. I did it and I didn't have to do anything crazy. Let's fast forward a little bit. Shit. I went down. OK, good. That high roller is a cheat.
[3331.85s -> 3365.32s]  Is he cheating? He's being watched by the floorman. I don't think he's cheating. Take a look. Watch this, please. Are you sure? No, no. He's spent a thousand dollars. He got a thousand dollars back, I guess.
[3365.82s -> 3391.23s]  I don't think he's cheating. We're bumping again. This is good. This is good news. No floors for people to come mess up. I'm going to drop the price here to 50 bucks. No, 45. 45 dollars a room. Let's fill every one of these rooms.
[3397.03s -> 3421.96s]  I'm out of ads. I'm completely out of ads. Stay up over 45, please. 23 hours. We'll be fine. Here comes the convention. What are hippies like?
[3422.46s -> 3453.78s]  Hippies like expensive drinks or cheap drinks? Cheap drinks. Cheap drinks and cheap food, right? What are they like for betting frequency? Jackpot frequency medium. Let's change all of our machines to medium.
[3456.18s -> 3486.78s]  Medium, jackpot, low. Let's go nuts here. Return percentage low. There's a big convention in town. Actually, I'll keep these the way they are.
[3487.84s -> 3510.18s]  20 more hours. Stay above 46. Come on. I almost forgot to say that one. I forgot to say that part. Why is there a commissioner by the front door? This is the doorman. He doesn't do anything right now, actually. He does nothing.
[3511.42s -> 3520.42s]  In fact, I'm not sure why he's still on payroll. Because he's supposed to block certain people from coming in. And I have allowed teenagers into the casino. So he's just a guy that stands.
[3522.89s -> 3540.82s]  19 hours. Here we go. 47. Where's the hippies? Here they are. Here they go. All right. We need extra staff. We need staff on duty and on guard at all times here.
[3541.82s -> 3558.35s]  We're about to give hippies really cheap drinks and cheap food. They're all checking in.
[3558.85s -> 3574.54s]  Mr. Janitor? Is that Puke? This table is making a lot of money. We'll get the other one. It's right next to it.
[3575.54s -> 3591.19s]  Here comes the Puke casino. Wait, hey. Wait a minute. They all checking into my hotel because it's the cheapest hotel and then leaving to go to the other casino.
[3591.69s -> 3611.61s]  Uh, well. All right. Then I have to. That's fine with me. I'll be the hotel. I'll be the hotel. That's okay. All right. More people coming in.
[3612.61s -> 3624.90s]  Porn theatre is not doing. Wait. What are hippies like? Hippies love porn, don't they? Make it cheaper. I knew it. That's why you're here. Get ready.
[3625.40s -> 3633.28s]  Get ready. You might as well puke into his dustpan. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. What are you doing?
[3634.28s -> 3654.02s]  Just puke right into his dustpan. All right. Cheap porn incoming. $12. You've done that. I can tell. You think I've puked into a dustpan.
[3655.02s -> 3671.24s]  It would just go everywhere. You wouldn't even be able to do that. I got a lot of money. Look at how much we've turned this around.
[3671.74s -> 3710.51s]  Uh oh. Uh, ma'am, you can't come back here. And that's for staff only. Evicted. And evict this guy too. Eject. Look at this old lady.
[3711.51s -> 3731.17s]  Trudy Coffee. Oh, good old Trudy Coffee. I love Trudy Coffee. What a great name. No, stay. Well, $5,000 in income. $5,000 in profit. That's good.
[3731.67s -> 3750.82s]  Trudy Cheetos. Well, should I throw them out? Maybe I shouldn't throw them out. Because they're going to just spend a bunch of money.
[3751.82s -> 3755.82s]  Uh oh. Ever since I threw away the two belligerent drunk people, I lost $2,000.
[3761.80s -> 3775.32s]  All right. Two more hours. One, two, and that's it. Did it.
[3778.32s -> 3782.32s]  Remember how I did this last night? I sold every single thing in the casino.
[3785.55s -> 3797.75s]  All right. I now have two hitmen. Our rivals are shaken up. We need to purchase real estate. That's my new objective is to buy real estate.
[3799.50s -> 3808.26s]  Save the game here. I got $50,000. I'm in the green. Things are going well. I can either make a hotel on top of here.
[3808.76s -> 3847.64s]  I could do a five-star hotel right here. That's $225 a night. That's $15,000. I'm going for it. $225 a night. Five-star hotel. Look at how nice this is.
[3855.22s -> 3867.46s]  And there's a bathroom in here. These ones don't even have bathrooms. That's pretty good. These ones are worse than prison cells.
[3867.96s -> 3872.44s]  It's just a bed and a bunch of walls.
[3873.44s -> 3879.94s]  All right. Just wait for the money to start rolling in. $225 a night.
[3880.94s -> 3893.48s]  In fact, it's our inaugural opening. Make it $205. Open a new casino. Here we go. How much money is it? What do we have available?
[3897.73s -> 3911.92s]  Okay. We can go Wasteland Manhattan Road. Wasteland Boston Road. Oh, these are all, this is all like, this is bad. This is all like out in the middle of nowhere.
[3912.42s -> 3932.24s]  Quick stop motel. Quick stop motels. And I'm going to put a Chuck E. Cheese over here. It's $30,000. What else do we got?
[3935.01s -> 3948.54s]  Red light. Should I put a Chuck E. Cheese style to kid's restaurant next to a red light brothel? Oh, yikes, as they say.
[3949.54s -> 3962.96s]  No, it's got to be, what about, look it, this is a nice place. No one's going to go there. Parents will drop them off and then go there.
[3965.86s -> 3978.41s]  That's not how that works. Well, I can't, I'm not going to do it yet. I don't want to be completely in the, I don't want to be completely in the, I want money.
[3982.53s -> 3991.77s]  All right. We got out of two hotels. The casino's here. Who wants money? The doorman does. I mean the doorman that hasn't had to do any work.
[3992.77s -> 4012.78s]  Actually has not had to do anything. You don't have to even do anything. See you later. That frees up some money that I can pay everybody else.
[4014.67s -> 4021.22s]  What do I even need a doorman for? I'm not blocking anybody from doing anything. Everybody can get a $5 raise now that he's gone.
[4029.24s -> 4046.26s]  What, are you, ma'am, leave the staff alone, please. Leave the staff alone. What, do you want to work here?
[4047.26s -> 4094.55s]  Okay. Here's the third cashier. Mimi Stemmer. Okay, yes. We're going to get you that new trailer. Come on. Yes, yes, you do.
[4095.05s -> 4117.60s]  The convention has now finished. I don't think that guy's real. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. Put it in slow motion for a second.
[4132.80s -> 4133.80s]  I need a new trailer.
[4152.19s -> 4153.19s]  The visitor you just beat up denied it.
[4158.20s -> 4165.64s]  Holy shit, she's still going. No, get it. She's going to stop.
[4166.64s -> 4169.04s]  I'd like to talk to.
[4169.04s -> 4170.04s]  Stop it.
[4170.04s -> 4171.85s]  I need a new trailer.
[4171.85s -> 4172.85s]  No, come here.
[4172.85s -> 4173.85s]  I need a new trailer.
[4176.95s -> 4189.12s]  Get in there and stop being so fucked up. Oh my God. Just get her in here.
[4191.00s -> 4199.80s]  One moment.
[4199.80s -> 4202.36s]  Wait, what? Are they fighting each other?
[4203.72s -> 4204.72s]  Why are they fighting each other?
[4205.72s -> 4207.28s]  Why is he hitting him in the face?
[4208.28s -> 4209.28s]  The visitor you just beat up denied it.
[4210.28s -> 4211.28s]  What the fuck is going on?
[4213.55s -> 4216.55s]  Oh my God. Just get rid of her.
[4217.55s -> 4218.55s]  Hold on, what?
[4219.92s -> 4220.92s]  Staff are asking for a raise.
[4220.92s -> 4221.92s]  Okay, fire somebody.
[4222.92s -> 4225.99s]  I need a new trailer.
[4230.81s -> 4231.81s]  Why are they still doing this?
[4232.31s -> 4243.42s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[4252.38s -> 4266.21s]  No, we can't. I can't.
[4266.21s -> 4267.21s]  I can't.
[4272.80s -> 4273.80s]  I crashed the game. Fuck.
[4283.89s -> 4285.89s]  I need a new trailer.
[4286.89s -> 4299.46s]  This ain't no firecracker.
[4300.46s -> 4312.09s]  Father, the visitor is on fire.
[4324.02s -> 4325.02s]  Excuse me.
[4336.07s -> 4338.07s]  No, that's not the right image.
[4340.07s -> 4341.07s]  Oh God.
[4346.26s -> 4354.58s]  Where's the image of me standing?
[4356.46s -> 4357.46s]  I saved over it. Where is it?
[4360.81s -> 4363.05s]  I'm not having Bernie Pog.
[4371.26s -> 4372.26s]  Okay, hold on. No.
[4373.26s -> 4374.26s]  Oh, this one's disgusting.
[4375.26s -> 4376.26s]  No, no, this one's, I don't like this one.
[4377.26s -> 4378.26s]  I don't want this on the screen for more than like three hours.
[4379.26s -> 4381.78s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[4381.78s -> 4382.78s]  No, this one's fucking horrible.
[4383.78s -> 4385.28s]  This is horrible.
[4386.28s -> 4396.74s]  It actually is terrible to look at.
[4397.74s -> 4417.22s]  That hurts to look at.
[4417.72s -> 4418.72s]  All right, here we go.
[4421.36s -> 4424.52s]  This is only going to stay on for like 20 minutes.
[4425.52s -> 4426.52s]  That's the wrong one.
[4431.41s -> 4432.41s]  Now I have to fire all these bouncers that I hired for no reason.
[4433.41s -> 4436.12s]  Yeah, hold on. Is this the right one?
[4437.12s -> 4445.28s]  They're all fucking gross.
[4446.28s -> 4460.89s]  All right, it didn't crash.
[4461.89s -> 4464.09s]  Good. All right.
[4465.09s -> 4468.23s]  Now I have to fire these guys and stop this.
[4487.60s -> 4494.28s]  Just get out of the way.
[4495.28s -> 4496.28s]  They're going to do this one more time.
[4497.28s -> 4498.28s]  I made five grand a day.
[4499.28s -> 4500.28s]  All right, just let her go back upstairs.
[4500.78s -> 4501.78s]  Just move out of the way.
[4502.78s -> 4503.78s]  I need to fire this.
[4504.78s -> 4505.78s]  No, no, this guy's one of my best bouncers.
[4506.78s -> 4508.02s]  These two have new hires.
[4509.02s -> 4510.02s]  I just hired them to beat up some lady.
[4511.02s -> 4513.22s]  Who's just the one that got hit in the face with a wrench?
[4520.28s -> 4521.28s]  Where's my second hitman?
[4522.28s -> 4526.40s]  There he is.
[4530.26s -> 4531.26s]  Okay, we don't need these yet.
[4532.26s -> 4533.26s]  All right, both of you stop this nonsense.
[4534.26s -> 4535.44s]  All right, Malvin.
[4536.44s -> 4540.54s]  He's doing this on his own.
[4541.54s -> 4550.21s]  All right, now go back upstairs.
[4551.21s -> 4553.34s]  No, you both fired.
[4553.84s -> 4554.84s]  This guy here, you're fired.
[4555.84s -> 4557.15s]  And this bouncer right here, you're also fired.
[4558.15s -> 4559.15s]  Oh shit.
[4560.58s -> 4561.58s]  Okay, now everybody, wait, wait, wait.
[4561.58s -> 4562.58s]  Money, money, money, money.
[4562.58s -> 4563.58s]  Look, money, look, money.
[4563.58s -> 4564.58s]  Look, look, look, look, look, money.
[4565.58s -> 4570.29s]  This dealer is almost, this dealer is going to make more than money than I will.
[4571.29s -> 4576.69s]  Why are you still down here beating up this lady?
[4577.69s -> 4583.64s]  Are you seriously still beating up this lady down here?
[4584.64s -> 4590.62s]  Tell her to leave.
[4591.62s -> 4602.97s]  Okay, 39,000.
[4602.97s -> 4603.97s]  How's the hotel doing?
[4603.97s -> 4606.30s]  Nobody is here.
[4607.30s -> 4609.18s]  Not one person.
[4609.18s -> 4617.01s]  Staff are asking for a raise.
[4617.51s -> 4618.51s]  Staff are asking for a raise.
[4619.51s -> 4621.65s]  You're gone.
[4627.62s -> 4634.62s]  Imagine seriously continuing to ask for this much money, but this table makes $21,000.
[4635.62s -> 4637.25s]  How much does this table make?
[4638.25s -> 4639.25s]  Okay, she's a five-star dealer.
[4640.25s -> 4644.32s]  She makes $367 a day.
[4645.62s -> 4648.62s]  This table takes in like $2,500 a day.
[4651.40s -> 4652.40s]  I've got to keep her around.
[4653.40s -> 4654.40s]  Does people come here for this dealer?
[4654.40s -> 4655.40s]  There's a good dealer.
[4655.90s -> 4665.14s]  $50 bonus, and that's enough.
[4666.14s -> 4668.14s]  I can't believe I just gave you $50 and you don't even care.
[4671.94s -> 4673.94s]  Holy shit, how much fucking money do you guys want?
[4678.00s -> 4679.00s]  Everybody wants a raise.
[4680.00s -> 4681.00s]  All of you want a raise.
[4682.00s -> 4683.00s]  Staff are asking for a raise.
[4687.31s -> 4688.31s]  Don't give weak bonuses.
[4688.31s -> 4689.31s]  That was a $50 bonus.
[4696.50s -> 4697.50s]  All right, I got 41 grand.
[4699.19s -> 4700.19s]  This needs to start taking in customers.
[4701.19s -> 4706.08s]  This shit's not taking in any customers.
[4707.08s -> 4713.44s]  All right, I think I'm ready.
[4714.44s -> 4715.44s]  This is generating enough money.
[4715.94s -> 4718.33s]  Ban the trailer trash.
[4723.98s -> 4725.98s]  Ban trailer trash, and then people will use it.
[4726.98s -> 4730.50s]  But that's my number one customer base.
[4731.94s -> 4732.94s]  I should convert the one up.
[4733.94s -> 4734.94s]  I shouldn't have done a five-star.
[4734.94s -> 4735.94s]  I should have done the one-star.
[4749.23s -> 4753.29s]  Promo.
[4753.29s -> 4754.29s]  I need more porn theaters.
[4755.72s -> 4756.72s]  I'm doing pretty well.
[4756.72s -> 4758.72s]  I'm making actually pretty decent profit right now.
[4762.90s -> 4763.90s]  Look, this theater's doing so good.
[4766.30s -> 4767.30s]  These old people in trailer trash are my number one.
[4768.30s -> 4770.30s]  All right, I think it's time for me to buy a property.
[4770.80s -> 4779.91s]  Or should I wait till like $60,000?
[4780.91s -> 4790.85s]  Well, clean it up.
[4792.54s -> 4793.54s]  Buy a brothel.
[4795.16s -> 4796.16s]  Get a brothel.
[4799.90s -> 4801.72s]  Buns Burger Bar.
[4802.72s -> 4816.56s]  So how does this work?
[4817.56s -> 4819.56s]  So there are 12 hookers in the Crypt Casino right now.
[4820.56s -> 4825.04s]  That's $4,000 to do this.
[4826.04s -> 4827.04s]  That's a ton of money.
[4837.05s -> 4839.05s]  I can minus take one away from there.
[4840.05s -> 4842.57s]  Where's my casino?
[4843.57s -> 4845.52s]  Slamming slots and lanes.
[4846.52s -> 4848.52s]  All right, I can either have more hookers come here.
[4849.52s -> 4850.52s]  Or get rid of them.
[4852.59s -> 4854.59s]  Send them to Pasta Italiano.
[4856.85s -> 4859.85s]  Should I just send like ten prostitutes to Pasta Italiano?
[4863.91s -> 4864.91s]  Well, that place is going to be a mess.
[4865.91s -> 4866.91s]  It burns down every other day.
[4867.91s -> 4868.91s]  And it's just all prostitutes.
[4872.07s -> 4874.07s]  What does that even do for me?
[4880.49s -> 4882.49s]  Send the hitmen to Pasta Italiano?
[4883.49s -> 4884.49s]  For what?
[4885.86s -> 4886.86s]  Why would I?
[4887.86s -> 4894.39s]  Why am I trying to destroy their business?
[4894.89s -> 4901.22s]  Send hitmen to Pasta Italiano?
[4903.36s -> 4904.36s]  Why would I do that?
[4912.06s -> 4915.06s]  What's the point of sending him to Pasta Italiano?
[4918.06s -> 4921.48s]  What the fuck?
[4923.30s -> 4925.30s]  Okay, go to Pasta Italiano.
[4931.21s -> 4935.18s]  Is this a mob movie?
[4939.68s -> 4940.68s]  I don't understand.
[4958.05s -> 4959.05s]  Where should we send him?
[4965.29s -> 4966.85s]  We'll send him there.
[4967.85s -> 4968.85s]  He eats lunch every day.
[4970.92s -> 4971.92s]  We all eat lunch every day.
[4972.92s -> 4973.92s]  But he specifically eats it.
[4974.92s -> 4975.92s]  Pasta fucking Italiano.
[4976.92s -> 4977.92s]  Wait, what? He spotted a cheater.
[4979.80s -> 4980.80s]  That's Trump?
[4982.87s -> 4984.87s]  All right, it's one step removed from Trump.
[4985.87s -> 4986.87s]  Fine.
[4986.87s -> 4987.87s]  Here's Trump.
[4987.87s -> 4988.87s]  You know, it's me, Donald.
[4988.87s -> 4989.87s]  It's me, Donald Trump.
[4989.87s -> 4994.87s]  And then this is me, Donald the Donald the Don.
[4995.37s -> 4998.37s]  It's one small degree of separation.
[4998.37s -> 4999.37s]  You know, the fucking guy.
[5000.37s -> 5001.37s]  Get him. It's me, Don.
[5002.37s -> 5003.37s]  All right, it's true.
[5003.37s -> 5004.37s]  Fine, whatever.
[5004.37s -> 5007.32s]  Wait, he arrived at Pasta Italiano.
[5007.32s -> 5011.05s]  What's he doing here?
[5011.05s -> 5018.03s]  Okay, he's in Pasta Italiano.
[5018.03s -> 5019.03s]  For what reason?
[5021.74s -> 5024.74s]  What's his purpose of being in Pasta Italiano?
[5049.08s -> 5050.08s]  Why would I do this?
[5051.82s -> 5052.82s]  Why would he do something like this?
[5058.15s -> 5062.97s]  No!
[5063.47s -> 5064.47s]  I don't want to do that.
[5064.47s -> 5066.47s]  This is not like a mob movie.
[5077.54s -> 5078.54s]  I know there's a fight.
[5078.54s -> 5079.54s]  Okay, Henrietta.
[5092.30s -> 5094.30s]  She's putting the cigarette on his face.
[5095.30s -> 5096.80s]  Oh, she's a cheater.
[5096.80s -> 5097.80s]  She's a cheater.
[5097.80s -> 5098.80s]  Get rid of her.
[5102.73s -> 5103.73s]  Nice work.
[5103.73s -> 5114.63s]  She's out.
[5115.13s -> 5118.37s]  Hey, don't put a bomb in the spaghetti.
[5118.37s -> 5138.17s]  I can't.
[5138.17s -> 5144.40s]  Can't?
[5144.40s -> 5146.40s]  I can't even go in here.
[5146.40s -> 5150.08s]  Save the game?
[5150.08s -> 5151.08s]  Hold on.
[5151.08s -> 5158.52s]  Hey, Jimmy the Fish sends his regards.
[5159.52s -> 5160.52s]  And the fish family.
[5181.35s -> 5187.26s]  Okay, well, that's a rewind.
[5187.26s -> 5193.15s]  Why am I here?
[5193.15s -> 5194.15s]  Why can I do this?
[5195.15s -> 5198.96s]  Why would I ever come into the Pasta Italiano?
[5201.36s -> 5203.36s]  After a wage war?
[5203.36s -> 5205.56s]  On what?
[5206.56s -> 5210.04s]  What's the?
[5210.04s -> 5211.04s]  What am I doing?
[5211.04s -> 5213.04s]  Who owns this place?
[5213.04s -> 5214.04s]  This is a competitor?
[5216.94s -> 5218.94s]  I got a better idea.
[5218.94s -> 5219.94s]  I got a better idea.
[5219.94s -> 5223.94s]  We're going to keep Frankie the Fish here.
[5223.94s -> 5224.94s]  So I can...
[5224.94s -> 5226.94s]  There's an Elvis convention coming in.
[5226.94s -> 5229.94s]  We're going to keep Frankie the Fish here.
[5229.94s -> 5233.12s]  Because I'm not going to have to do anything.
[5233.12s -> 5236.12s]  I will make a casino bet with you here.
[5236.12s -> 5238.12s]  I don't have to do anything.
[5238.62s -> 5240.62s]  That within the next 20 minutes,
[5240.62s -> 5242.62s]  this place will be on fucking fire.
[5242.62s -> 5244.62s]  And these people will all be dead.
[5244.62s -> 5250.31s]  And I won't have to do anything.
[5250.31s -> 5254.97s]  In fact, let's just test this theory.
[5254.97s -> 5256.97s]  Let's see how long it takes
[5256.97s -> 5258.97s]  for Pasta Italiano to catch fire
[5258.97s -> 5261.34s]  a seventh or eighth time.
[5267.74s -> 5303.15s]  Wait.
[5303.15s -> 5305.15s]  There's a lot of chefs in here.
[5311.63s -> 5313.38s]  Really?
[5313.88s -> 5314.88s]  Hold on.
[5314.88s -> 5315.88s]  We'll go back.
[5316.88s -> 5328.07s]  Nightspot is out of business.
[5328.07s -> 5329.07s]  Good.
[5329.07s -> 5330.07s]  I'm still here.
[5331.07s -> 5333.20s]  Oh my God.
[5333.20s -> 5334.20s]  Just hold on.
[5334.20s -> 5335.20s]  Two days.
[5335.20s -> 5336.20s]  It's been two days.
[5361.32s -> 5362.32s]  On the third day.
[5365.32s -> 5366.32s]  He's just standing here.
[5366.32s -> 5367.32s]  It's going to happen.
[5367.32s -> 5371.22s]  This place catches fire fucking twice a week.
[5372.22s -> 5374.22s]  What the fuck guys?
[5376.62s -> 5378.62s]  What the fuck guys?
[5378.62s -> 5382.96s]  Just to shut you up.
[5382.96s -> 5384.96s]  I need a new trailer.
[5384.96s -> 5386.96s]  I need a new trailer.
[5386.96s -> 5388.96s]  How many people are in there?
[5395.96s -> 5398.96s]  This place is getting overrun.
[5398.96s -> 5399.96s]  Oh my God.
[5399.96s -> 5403.16s]  It's getting overrun.
[5403.16s -> 5404.16s]  Is this why?
[5404.16s -> 5405.16s]  They want to...
[5405.16s -> 5406.46s]  Wait a minute.
[5406.46s -> 5410.24s]  What's happening in my casino?
[5410.24s -> 5412.24s]  The people at Garfield are going to quit.
[5412.24s -> 5414.98s]  What?
[5414.98s -> 5415.48s]  Wait.
[5415.48s -> 5416.48s]  Wait to stay.
[5427.57s -> 5428.57s]  Oh my God.
[5428.57s -> 5429.57s]  They're everywhere.
[5434.20s -> 5445.30s]  Come on.
[5445.30s -> 5447.30s]  Do it already.
[5447.30s -> 5467.33s]  I want to drop a match.
[5467.33s -> 5469.33s]  I have $62,000, man.
[5470.33s -> 5476.18s]  Alright.
[5476.18s -> 5477.18s]  One more day.
[5477.18s -> 5479.18s]  And then I will admit defeat.
[5479.18s -> 5481.18s]  And a clown convention starts in a couple of days.
[5481.18s -> 5482.18s]  Perfect timing.
[5484.18s -> 5495.02s]  Yes.
[5495.02s -> 5515.37s]  I didn't have to do shit.
[5515.37s -> 5517.38s]  No.
[5517.88s -> 5518.88s]  No.
[5518.88s -> 5520.88s]  I'm not going to bomb now.
[5520.88s -> 5531.85s]  I told you.
[5531.85s -> 5533.85s]  These fucking idiots.
[5533.85s -> 5536.85s]  We're going to light this place on fire in a few days.
[5536.85s -> 5537.85s]  I told you.
[5537.85s -> 5538.85s]  I told you.
[5540.85s -> 5541.85s]  He's burnt me.
[5542.85s -> 5543.85s]  You just burnt me.
[5543.85s -> 5547.30s]  You just burnt me.
[5547.30s -> 5555.46s]  Who's this guy?
[5559.26s -> 5561.26s]  Police are going to an opponent's place.
[5563.75s -> 5564.75s]  Oh shit.
[5565.25s -> 5566.25s]  No.
[5567.25s -> 5568.25s]  Leave.
[5568.25s -> 5569.25s]  Leave the building quick.
[5569.25s -> 5571.25s]  Leave the building quick.
[5571.25s -> 5591.46s]  You're going to be dying.
[5591.46s -> 5593.46s]  Oh, you fucked up.
[5593.46s -> 5595.46s]  There was this police out here.
[5595.46s -> 5598.46s]  But I didn't even do anything.
[5600.15s -> 5602.15s]  I didn't do anything.
[5604.60s -> 5610.64s]  I got the thing burnt, the place down.
[5610.64s -> 5612.64s]  The lady lit me on fire.
[5612.64s -> 5615.64s]  So I raised my firearm in self-defense
[5616.14s -> 5620.14s]  when the lady is doing it on purpose trying to kill me.
[5620.14s -> 5622.14s]  And then I get shot by that guy.
[5625.78s -> 5626.78s]  I knew it.
[5626.78s -> 5627.78s]  I told you it was going to happen.
[5627.78s -> 5632.65s]  These guys suck.
[5632.65s -> 5633.65s]  Reset it.
[5640.33s -> 5641.33s]  Who do I have left?
[5641.33s -> 5644.08s]  Oh, I still have one.
[5644.08s -> 5645.08s]  I'm good.
[5645.08s -> 5646.08s]  I got Otis.
[5646.08s -> 5647.08s]  Otis is good to go.
[5647.08s -> 5657.62s]  I don't need to correct the timeline.
[5657.62s -> 5659.62s]  I got $62,000.
[5659.62s -> 5667.06s]  I need a new trailer.
[5668.00s -> 5669.00s]  All right.
[5669.00s -> 5670.00s]  We're good.
[5670.00s -> 5671.36s]  We're good.
[5671.36s -> 5672.36s]  I got tons of fucking money.
[5672.36s -> 5679.15s]  We can buy a new property.
[5679.15s -> 5680.15s]  All right.
[5680.15s -> 5681.15s]  Let's make the Chuck E. Cheese.
[5681.15s -> 5682.15s]  Stop saying Chuck E. Cheese.
[5682.15s -> 5684.15s]  It's not what that is.
[5684.15s -> 5687.15s]  Slamming slots to extra lanes.
[5687.15s -> 5688.15s]  I don't know.
[5688.15s -> 5689.15s]  What was it called?
[5689.15s -> 5694.48s]  Slots of cheese.
[5694.48s -> 5695.48s]  All right.
[5695.48s -> 5696.92s]  This is still generating fucking cash.
[5696.92s -> 5697.92s]  Good.
[5697.92s -> 5699.09s]  Look at this.
[5699.09s -> 5700.09s]  All I had to do.
[5700.09s -> 5701.09s]  Drop the price even more.
[5701.09s -> 5702.09s]  $195.
[5702.09s -> 5705.38s]  Where are the clowns?
[5705.38s -> 5706.38s]  I told you this shit was going to burn.
[5706.38s -> 5708.13s]  I didn't think it was going to happen.
[5708.13s -> 5710.13s]  Let's have these people go cheat.
[5710.81s -> 5711.81s]  Toy Box Casino.
[5711.81s -> 5713.81s]  Looking for two grand from each one of you.
[5713.81s -> 5721.10s]  Go to the Crip Casino.
[5721.10s -> 5722.10s]  Two grand from both of you.
[5722.10s -> 5723.10s]  Is that $1,500?
[5723.10s -> 5727.29s]  I made $624.
[5727.29s -> 5728.29s]  Yes.
[5728.29s -> 5729.29s]  I know.
[5729.29s -> 5730.29s]  I think somebody's cheating.
[5730.29s -> 5734.47s]  Who's cheating?
[5734.47s -> 5736.47s]  Somebody has to be, right?
[5736.47s -> 5746.33s]  Did I get big bits?
[5746.33s -> 5747.33s]  Oh shit.
[5747.33s -> 5748.33s]  My thing is fucked up.
[5748.33s -> 5749.76s]  Hold on.
[5749.76s -> 5750.76s]  I'm going to make a new save here.
[5750.76s -> 5754.51s]  This is going to be called After Fish.
[5754.51s -> 5765.93s]  Crash?
[5765.93s -> 5769.98s]  Don't crash.
[5769.98s -> 5771.61s]  I'm good.
[5771.61s -> 5773.04s]  I don't think it crashed.
[5773.54s -> 5777.10s]  We had two very, very, very big bit donations.
[5777.10s -> 5781.10s]  We had one $69 bit donation.
[5781.10s -> 5783.10s]  6900 bits from Vilemi.
[5783.10s -> 5786.34s]  Thanks for the 69 fucking dollars.
[5786.34s -> 5788.82s]  That's a lot of money.
[5788.82s -> 5789.82s]  Nice.
[5789.82s -> 5791.00s]  Yeah, okay.
[5791.00s -> 5794.00s]  Jeremy, why would you send an arsonist to burn down Vinny's restaurant?
[5794.00s -> 5797.45s]  That wasn't Vinny's restaurant.
[5797.45s -> 5798.45s]  What are you talking about?
[5798.45s -> 5803.00s]  That was Pasta Italiano.
[5803.00s -> 5805.00s]  That place just sucks.
[5805.00s -> 5806.00s]  I don't have to do anything.
[5806.00s -> 5808.00s]  They'll just destroy themselves.
[5808.50s -> 5812.30s]  I can't believe he died.
[5812.30s -> 5813.30s]  It's all right.
[5813.30s -> 5815.30s]  The timeline has to stay the same.
[5815.30s -> 5821.06s]  That's not even Vinny's restaurant.
[5821.06s -> 5822.06s]  What are you talking about?
[5822.06s -> 5823.06s]  That's not Vinny's restaurant.
[5823.06s -> 5825.26s]  What does that mean?
[5825.26s -> 5826.26s]  I don't even know what that means.
[5826.26s -> 5828.26s]  He literally doesn't know Vinny.
[5828.26s -> 5829.26s]  What?
[5829.26s -> 5839.88s]  It's the Vinesauce restaurant.
[5839.88s -> 5843.70s]  Yeah, I know who Vinny is, but you think I just don't know who that is?
[5843.70s -> 5844.70s]  Who's Vinny?
[5844.70s -> 5845.70s]  Who are you talking about?
[5845.70s -> 5847.13s]  Vinny?
[5847.13s -> 5850.13s]  Vinny like Vinny the Cheese?
[5850.13s -> 5851.13s]  Frankie the Fish?
[5851.13s -> 5852.13s]  What do you mean?
[5852.13s -> 5856.80s]  Yeah, mob movies.
[5857.30s -> 5859.30s]  Vinny the Pasta Italiano.
[5859.30s -> 5870.87s]  That's not what it is.
[5870.87s -> 5872.87s]  Anyways, thanks for the 6,900 bits.
[5872.87s -> 5875.32s]  That's a lot of money.
[5875.32s -> 5877.32s]  And then Phylacter Lich gave 5,000 bits too.
[5877.32s -> 5882.19s]  Another 50 dollars.
[5882.19s -> 5884.19s]  Germa, you should really send your Hitman to the Crypt Casino.
[5884.19s -> 5886.68s]  It's your biggest competition.
[5886.68s -> 5888.68s]  Also, shout out to the pre-stream chat.
[5888.68s -> 5889.68s]  We all have one thing in common.
[5889.68s -> 5891.68s]  An unhealthy desire to see Germa stream.
[5891.68s -> 5894.95s]  I have an unhealthy desire to stream.
[5894.95s -> 5897.76s]  That works.
[5897.76s -> 5901.09s]  Thanks for the 50 dollars.
[5901.09s -> 5902.09s]  A thousand times.
[5903.02s -> 5905.02s]  And then Lime Liquors, thanks for the 5 community subs.
[5905.02s -> 5907.52s]  That was earlier, but thanks guys.
[5907.52s -> 5909.82s]  Thanks for the 120 dollars.
[5909.82s -> 5911.82s]  150 dollars almost.
[5911.82s -> 5914.45s]  Thanks guys, seriously.
[5914.45s -> 5917.38s]  Thank you.
[5917.38s -> 5919.77s]  Who's cheating?
[5919.77s -> 5925.91s]  Where are we losing the money from?
[5925.91s -> 5926.91s]  Why is this place empty right now?
[5926.91s -> 5930.52s]  No, it's not.
[5930.52s -> 5932.52s]  You're overpaying staff.
[5932.52s -> 5933.52s]  Yeah, you're right.
[5933.52s -> 5934.89s]  Fuck.
[5934.89s -> 5936.89s]  Oh, you make 600 dollars a day.
[5936.89s -> 5939.58s]  It's time for you to go.
[5939.58s -> 5940.58s]  Time to go.
[5940.58s -> 5941.82s]  Fire.
[5941.82s -> 5942.82s]  Cashier, you're fired.
[5943.88s -> 5946.18s]  Our staff level 4, you're fired.
[5946.18s -> 5948.18s]  Who else is making way too much money?
[5948.18s -> 5950.18s]  This Janet is making, I know Travis.
[5950.18s -> 5952.18s]  Travis, you make too much money.
[5952.18s -> 5955.12s]  Travis, you're fired.
[5955.12s -> 5957.30s]  Burek, you're fired.
[5957.30s -> 5963.96s]  I know, I know, I know.
[5963.96s -> 5969.84s]  I gotta free up some money here, guys.
[5969.84s -> 5971.84s]  Who are you?
[5971.84s -> 5976.00s]  You're a level 1 dealer and you want 180 bucks fired.

[5983.20s -> 5985.20s]  I'll give you 200.
[5986.33s -> 5989.66s]  I'll give you 180.
[5989.66s -> 5991.66s]  This dealer, level 1 dealer, wants 3 times the city average.
[5991.66s -> 5994.34s]  You're fired.
[5994.34s -> 5996.58s]  Bar staff, want twice the city average, you're fired.
[5996.58s -> 5998.58s]  Server, you want 3 times city average, you're fired.
[5998.58s -> 6002.23s]  You have 1 guard?
[6002.23s -> 6005.10s]  Wait, that's Garfield.
[6005.10s -> 6008.74s]  Yeah, Garfield, you can stay.
[6008.74s -> 6012.33s]  This level 4 bouncer though, let's make you happy.
[6012.33s -> 6016.94s]  I'll give you 215.
[6016.94s -> 6019.30s]  Bounce events is starting.
[6019.30s -> 6022.06s]  Alright, now let's get some new staff in here.
[6022.06s -> 6024.06s]  New staff, we need a poker dealer.
[6024.06s -> 6026.49s]  We gotta get people here now.
[6026.99s -> 6030.19s]  Level 4, it gets to be a little too late.
[6030.19s -> 6032.49s]  Level 5, you're 220 dollars.
[6032.49s -> 6034.49s]  That's good.
[6034.49s -> 6036.49s]  Good starting.
[6036.49s -> 6039.50s]  Are you a poker player?
[6039.50s -> 6042.19s]  Good, right here, roulette.
[6042.19s -> 6051.28s]  And then we need some bar staff.
[6051.28s -> 6053.28s]  That's good, we have roulette.
[6053.28s -> 6055.71s]  We need a server over here.
[6055.71s -> 6060.19s]  We need some bar staff.
[6060.19s -> 6062.19s]  Level 3 bar staff is fine, and a level 2 is fine.
[6062.19s -> 6066.80s]  You guys can both get to work.
[6066.80s -> 6071.02s]  Here come the clown.
[6071.02s -> 6074.40s]  I thought that guy was a clown for a second.
[6074.90s -> 6079.30s]  Look, it's that easy.
[6079.30s -> 6085.31s]  I need a cashier.
[6085.31s -> 6087.31s]  Level 1 cashier.
[6087.31s -> 6090.00s]  You just keep doing movie tickets.
[6090.00s -> 6092.00s]  That's running now, we got one over here.
[6092.00s -> 6106.26s]  Here come the clowns.
[6106.26s -> 6110.22s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[6110.22s -> 6112.22s]  All the rooms are almost occupied up here.
[6112.22s -> 6115.04s]  Getting some good occupancy here.
[6115.04s -> 6119.63s]  There's a clown.
[6119.63s -> 6121.63s]  8200, that's a lot so far.
[6121.63s -> 6123.63s]  This one's been here the whole time.
[6123.63s -> 6127.02s]  That's not bad.
[6127.02s -> 6135.86s]  Now we need a floor manager.
[6136.36s -> 6138.92s]  Mr. Ransom.
[6138.92s -> 6141.22s]  Be our floor manager, please.
[6141.22s -> 6144.23s]  And now we're not bleeding money through staff anymore.
[6144.23s -> 6148.58s]  Where's the janitor?
[6148.58s -> 6150.95s]  I fired the janitor, right?
[6150.95s -> 6154.85s]  Level 4 janitor, that's pretty good.
[6154.85s -> 6157.09s]  Actually, we don't even need a level 4 janitor.
[6157.09s -> 6159.09s]  There's no trash.
[6159.09s -> 6169.32s]  Nice.
[6169.32s -> 6174.42s]  What are the burgers?
[6174.42s -> 6176.42s]  There's a convention in town, let's overprice everything.
[6176.42s -> 6186.00s]  Brinks as well.
[6186.00s -> 6190.63s]  Let's go open our Chuck E. Cheese.
[6191.13s -> 6193.43s]  Stop saying
[6193.43s -> 6197.14s]  that name.
[6197.14s -> 6199.58s]  It's not...
[6199.58s -> 6201.58s]  It's fucking
[6201.58s -> 6203.58s]  slots of cheese.
[6203.58s -> 6213.03s]  Anyways, let's go.
[6213.03s -> 6215.03s]  Time to buy...
[6215.03s -> 6218.49s]  This is too much.
[6218.49s -> 6221.05s]  30,000.
[6221.05s -> 6223.05s]  The wasteland.
[6223.05s -> 6225.05s]  I can't afford anywhere else.
[6225.05s -> 6230.86s]  This is not bad.
[6230.86s -> 6232.86s]  I can buy the gym and turn it into a Chuck E. Cheese.
[6232.86s -> 6235.86s]  I can buy the bookstore and turn it into a Chuck E. Cheese.
[6236.36s -> 6238.92s]  Buy the pawn shop.
[6238.92s -> 6242.89s]  The cupcake bakery.
[6242.89s -> 6245.96s]  Frankie's Fish.
[6245.96s -> 6249.61s]  I'm eventually going to have to own that.
[6249.61s -> 6253.26s]  How about right here?
[6253.26s -> 6258.96s]  The bookstore.
[6258.96s -> 6266.76s]  That's a prime location right here.
[6266.76s -> 6268.76s]  Go buy Pasta Italiano.
[6268.76s -> 6273.56s]  Where even is Pasta Italiano?
[6273.56s -> 6276.38s]  Right there.
[6276.38s -> 6283.16s]  Can I buy Pasta Italiano?
[6283.16s -> 6285.16s]  I definitely can buy Pasta Italiano.
[6285.16s -> 6293.66s]  Where is it?
[6293.66s -> 6297.56s]  No, I can't buy Pasta Italiano.
[6297.56s -> 6299.80s]  Alright, I'm going to buy this one here.
[6299.80s -> 6307.10s]  The bookstore.
[6307.10s -> 6313.42s]  Candy store or bookstore?
[6313.42s -> 6315.42s]  Drug store?
[6315.42s -> 6321.76s]  No, this isn't a much better location.
[6321.76s -> 6326.11s]  The candy store is right next to the toy box.
[6326.11s -> 6329.56s]  That's competition.
[6329.56s -> 6331.56s]  I don't have that money.
[6331.56s -> 6334.06s]  No, I'm doing the bookstore.
[6334.06s -> 6336.06s]  I'm bidding $31,000 for it right now.
[6336.06s -> 6348.01s]  You good?
[6348.01s -> 6350.01s]  Just open up a Spite store next to Pasta Italiano.
[6350.01s -> 6356.80s]  What is this?
[6356.80s -> 6361.84s]  It's an auction.
[6361.84s -> 6364.14s]  I'm the highest bidder.
[6364.14s -> 6366.14s]  Oh, it has to take a day or two.
[6366.14s -> 6374.20s]  No one is going to outbid me for the bookstore.
[6374.20s -> 6376.20s]  Make Pasta Italiano go bankrupt and then buy it.
[6378.20s -> 6380.20s]  Well, that's never going to happen.
[6380.20s -> 6382.20s]  Considering Pasta Italiano has
[6382.20s -> 6384.20s]  burnt down ten times and rebuilt
[6384.20s -> 6386.20s]  100% every time.
[6386.20s -> 6388.20s]  Whoever owns Pasta Italiano
[6388.20s -> 6390.44s]  has hundreds of billions of dollars
[6390.44s -> 6392.68s]  in money to spend.
[6392.68s -> 6397.10s]  It doesn't matter what happens.
[6397.10s -> 6399.10s]  I want to make my arcade.
[6399.10s -> 6401.10s]  Got it.
[6401.10s -> 6404.81s]  And
[6404.81s -> 6406.81s]  I got it for free.
[6406.81s -> 6408.81s]  I just got $30,000 for doing that.
[6410.81s -> 6412.81s]  Wheel of Fortune has been unlocked.
[6412.81s -> 6414.81s]  And I can get a large sport betting bar now.
[6419.80s -> 6421.80s]  You must control the majority of
[6421.80s -> 6426.35s]  Fortune Falls gambling.
[6426.35s -> 6428.35s]  I need 45% market share.
[6428.35s -> 6434.49s]  Holy shit.
[6434.49s -> 6437.95s]  Alright, I got another.
[6437.95s -> 6440.70s]  Here we go.
[6440.70s -> 6443.39s]  Colston's Bookstore.
[6443.39s -> 6447.04s]  That's ugly.
[6447.04s -> 6449.04s]  Firefighters have been called to the toy box.
[6449.04s -> 6452.24s]  Your cheat brought home $1,500.
[6452.24s -> 6456.14s]  Clams.
[6456.14s -> 6461.52s]  One floor.
[6461.52s -> 6463.52s]  I made $935.
[6463.52s -> 6467.87s]  Alright, here we go.
[6467.87s -> 6469.87s]  Arcade machine.
[6469.87s -> 6472.36s]  Endball machine.
[6472.36s -> 6474.36s]  Pool tables. Big bowling alley.
[6474.36s -> 6476.36s]  Small dance floor.
[6476.36s -> 6480.97s]  This is going to be a fun place for kids.
[6480.97s -> 6484.43s]  Arcade machines.
[6484.43s -> 6489.61s]  Row. And then another row.
[6489.61s -> 6493.26s]  Make this the porn house instead?
[6493.26s -> 6495.26s]  The title of the stream is Chuck E. Cheese.
[6495.26s -> 6501.08s]  I'll buy another property
[6501.08s -> 6510.94s]  and make it a porn house.
[6510.94s -> 6512.94s]  Arcade machines. Line in the front door.
[6512.94s -> 6525.42s]  When you walk into Slam and Slot's
[6525.42s -> 6527.85s]  cheesy style,
[6527.85s -> 6529.85s]  you are met with an incredible array
[6529.85s -> 6531.85s]  of old classic video games.
[6531.85s -> 6535.95s]  Take a step by.
[6535.95s -> 6543.04s]  Line. That's a line.
[6543.04s -> 6546.11s]  Take a step by.
[6546.11s -> 6549.24s]  And see the...
[6549.24s -> 6558.20s]  E. Cheese.
[6558.20s -> 6560.89s]  It's got to be like...
[6560.89s -> 6576.88s]  I can't wait.
[6576.88s -> 6583.98s]  Let me do the thing I want to do.
[6583.98s -> 6585.98s]  The competition just bought
[6585.98s -> 6590.01s]  another property. Who did?
[6590.01s -> 6592.01s]  They just bought the Slam and Drinks bar.
[6592.01s -> 6603.53s]  Oh, fuck off. What do I have in storage?
[6603.53s -> 6609.85s]  Oh, cool.
[6609.85s -> 6612.67s]  No. I don't know how
[6612.67s -> 6615.74s]  I want to do this.
[6615.74s -> 6617.74s]  Somebody said, what is happening here?
[6617.74s -> 6622.84s]  I don't know. I don't know how I want to do the
[6622.84s -> 6626.30s]  layout. I'm going to store these.
[6626.30s -> 6629.18s]  Okay, I want... What's the big attraction in here?
[6629.18s -> 6631.48s]  It's obviously... It's obviously
[6631.48s -> 6634.36s]  the bowling alleys. Yeah.
[6634.36s -> 6636.73s]  This is... Shuuuuuuuuuuuuut
[6636.73s -> 6638.91s]  uuuuup.
[6638.91s -> 6646.27s]  Bowling alley. Walls first.
[6646.27s -> 6648.27s]  Walls first. I don't have any walls. Oh, make
[6648.27s -> 6650.27s]  walls, you mean. Okay.
[6650.27s -> 6652.27s]  Large wall. So you come on
[6652.27s -> 6654.27s]  in the front door and you're met with
[6654.27s -> 6656.27s]  the first line.
[6656.27s -> 6664.83s]  Run! Just run!
[6664.83s -> 6669.50s]  Oh, no. He's going to...
[6669.50s -> 6671.50s]  He's going to get beat up.
[6673.50s -> 6678.22s]  Walls are a waste.
[6678.22s -> 6680.22s]  Whatever. He's going to get his ass kicked and he's going to fucking turn.
[6680.22s -> 6682.84s]  Whatever. Who cares?
[6682.84s -> 6685.21s]  Alright, let's go to uh...
[6685.21s -> 6705.37s]  Oh, here it is.
[6705.37s -> 6716.51s]  Your cheat has changed sides.
[6716.51s -> 6718.51s]  Alright, so let's do a wall coming in.
[6718.51s -> 6721.20s]  You walk in the front door and you're greeted
[6721.20s -> 6724.20s]  with...
[6724.20s -> 6726.20s]  Why am I... Oh my god.
[6726.20s -> 6728.57s]  That's... Free striking route.
[6728.57s -> 6736.89s]  This is changing as soon as possible.
[6736.89s -> 6738.89s]  I'm thinking like arcade machines lining
[6738.89s -> 6741.20s]  both walls. Yeah.
[6741.20s -> 6751.37s]  That would be sick.
[6751.37s -> 6776.65s]  It's just machines. Machines.
[6776.65s -> 6779.15s]  God damn it. I can't do that. I need so much
[6779.15s -> 6794.76s]  space. Fuck does anything look like?
[6794.76s -> 6797.39s]  You know what I mean?
[6797.39s -> 6801.61s]  Anybody else have trouble doing this shit? Like,
[6801.61s -> 6803.92s]  what does anything even look like?
[6803.92s -> 6805.92s]  If I walked into a store or I walked into
[6805.92s -> 6807.92s]  an arcade or something, it's like, oh, this is what it looks like.
[6807.92s -> 6809.92s]  Looking at it from the top without
[6809.92s -> 6812.60s]  anything there. I don't...
[6812.60s -> 6814.60s]  How the fuck does any of this shit even make any sense?
[6814.60s -> 6816.60s]  I don't even know how this makes... I don't even know how this
[6816.60s -> 6820.00s]  works. Like, I don't even
[6820.00s -> 6837.77s]  know. Oh, fuck my game.
[6837.77s -> 6839.77s]  Okay, maybe separate it a little more?
[6839.77s -> 6842.78s]  Like this. It's gonna just be like
[6842.78s -> 6844.78s]  fucking toilets back here. Who cares?
[6844.78s -> 6850.46s]  No, this doesn't even make any sense.
[6850.46s -> 6852.46s]  What the fuck does anything even look like from above?
[6852.46s -> 6854.46s]  What does anything even
[6854.46s -> 6865.53s]  look like? Like, I
[6865.53s -> 6867.53s]  couldn't explain to you what a arcade...
[6867.53s -> 6869.84s]  It's just like machines
[6869.84s -> 6871.84s]  everywhere. There's no, like, walls.
[6874.01s -> 6876.19s]  It's like this. There'll be like a wall
[6876.19s -> 6881.05s]  in the middle to separate, like,
[6881.05s -> 6889.88s]  one thing. Like, there'll be machines over here
[6889.88s -> 6891.88s]  and then there'll be like machines over here and like a
[6891.88s -> 6895.79s]  fucking skeeball. The walls are usually made
[6895.79s -> 6898.35s]  out of arcade machines. Yeah.
[6898.35s -> 6901.08s]  Well, this will be the restaurant side.
[6901.08s -> 6903.08s]  Yeah, this is like where you get your pizza and your fucking
[6903.08s -> 6905.08s]  fruit snacks and shit and this is the arcade over here.
[6905.08s -> 6907.58s]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[6907.58s -> 6910.59s]  I get it. Just look up a reference.
[6910.59s -> 6912.59s]  One would look up a Chuck E. Cheese
[6912.59s -> 6923.26s]  blueprint. Okay.
[6923.26s -> 6925.26s]  Chuck E. Cheese floor plan.
[6925.26s -> 6931.00s]  What do these even look like? Okay,
[6931.00s -> 6938.36s]  here we go. Alright, how does this work?
[6938.36s -> 6941.24s]  We'll see what this looks like.
[6941.24s -> 6943.24s]  There's a Chuck E. Cheese...
[6943.24s -> 6947.15s]  There's a floor plan for how...
[6947.15s -> 6958.86s]  Alright, let's see. Let's see what this looks like.
[6958.86s -> 6961.80s]  I feel like this is
[6961.80s -> 6964.75s]  impossible.
[6964.75s -> 6966.75s]  What are you doing? You'll suffer,
[6966.75s -> 6968.75s]  Jeremy, with, like, you just, like,
[6968.75s -> 6970.75s]  scribbled on a piece of paper.
[6970.75s -> 6986.28s]  Let me open this. Does anybody
[6986.28s -> 6988.28s]  else fucking hate Windows 10?
[6988.28s -> 6990.28s]  You know when, like, you have a
[6990.28s -> 6992.52s]  file on your computer
[6992.52s -> 6994.52s]  and you go to, like, the
[6994.52s -> 6996.52s]  home screen and you type in the search bar
[6996.52s -> 6998.52s]  but you know the
[6998.52s -> 7000.52s]  title of the image or the title
[7000.52s -> 7002.52s]  of a video or something that you have on your computer
[7002.52s -> 7004.52s]  and the search bar is just like, I have no fucking idea
[7004.52s -> 7006.52s]  what the hell you're talking about. That doesn't
[7006.52s -> 7009.40s]  exist on your whole computer.
[7009.40s -> 7018.36s]  Who made this and why is it so bad?
[7018.36s -> 7020.36s]  Like, that's the title of this thing.
[7020.36s -> 7027.08s]  Why is... I can't get mad.
[7027.08s -> 7029.08s]  What am I going to do?
[7029.08s -> 7033.93s]  Alright, there it is.
[7033.93s -> 7035.93s]  Is my computer crashing? Don't even crash. You better not.
[7035.93s -> 7042.00s]  Okay.
[7042.00s -> 7044.00s]  This isn't even a floor plan.
[7044.00s -> 7047.13s]  This is, like, a view
[7047.13s -> 7049.13s]  of the... I knew
[7049.13s -> 7055.66s]  this was fucked up. This is
[7055.66s -> 7057.66s]  of, like, a strip mall and Chuck E. Cheese
[7057.66s -> 7060.48s]  is one of the squares here. No.
[7060.48s -> 7063.10s]  No. That's, like, a place.
[7063.10s -> 7065.10s]  That's, like, a specific Chuck E. Cheese
[7065.10s -> 7067.10s]  and specific business.
[7067.10s -> 7069.40s]  Oh, no. I don't want... I'm not showing that.
[7069.40s -> 7071.40s]  Where is it? Just a floor plan of
[7071.40s -> 7073.40s]  arcade floor plan.
[7073.40s -> 7091.23s]  Here we go. You got one?
[7091.23s -> 7093.23s]  Is this a SpongeBob thing? I see...
[7093.23s -> 7096.36s]  Sponge in here. Backstage.
[7096.36s -> 7098.36s]  Freddy Fazbear. What is it?
[7098.36s -> 7101.18s]  Okay. Freddy's dining hall.
[7101.18s -> 7113.20s]  Okay. Let's see.
[7113.20s -> 7121.05s]  So, pirate, pirate.
[7121.05s -> 7125.26s]  Break room. Alright.
[7125.26s -> 7127.26s]  So, boss. Ladies are...
[7127.26s -> 7129.26s]  Freddy's... This dining hall is in the middle.
[7129.26s -> 7132.01s]  So there's two walls.
[7132.01s -> 7134.01s]  I'll use this as a reference for a little bit.
[7134.01s -> 7144.70s]  Freddy's Fazbear. Is this like a...
[7144.70s -> 7146.70s]  Five Nights at Freddy's, like, fan
[7146.70s -> 7148.70s]  plot? Or is this, like, the actual...
[7148.70s -> 7150.70s]  This is the...
[7150.70s -> 7152.70s]  Okay, this is just a plot.
[7152.70s -> 7154.70s]  This is just the Five Nights at Freddy's security
[7154.70s -> 7156.70s]  images that you go to.
[7156.70s -> 7162.06s]  Right. This is like somebody made
[7162.06s -> 7164.43s]  a fan one. Okay.
[7164.43s -> 7166.43s]  Well, I'm gonna use it, because it's what I have.
[7166.43s -> 7172.70s]  So we got the backstage area, but that's the
[7172.70s -> 7174.70s]  elevator, so we can't really do much there.
[7174.70s -> 7176.70s]  Okay. Arcade.
[7176.70s -> 7181.74s]  The dining hall is here.
[7181.74s -> 7183.74s]  I can't even... I don't even know what this looks like. I can't even do it.
[7183.74s -> 7187.52s]  Break room. Okay. There's a break room
[7187.52s -> 7194.11s]  up here. Okay. Break room.
[7194.11s -> 7196.92s]  Pirate cove. So there'll be
[7196.92s -> 7199.68s]  a pirate cove.
[7199.68s -> 7201.85s]  Supply closet.
[7201.85s -> 7212.40s]  Okay, so supply closet,
[7212.40s -> 7216.62s]  janitor. And then this is the break room.
[7216.62s -> 7218.92s]  And then pirate's cove
[7218.92s -> 7220.92s]  goes out this way. So this is pirate's cove.
[7220.92s -> 7224.44s]  Which then goes like this.
[7224.44s -> 7230.33s]  Feels like little tabs.
[7230.33s -> 7235.56s]  Okay. And then there's like
[7235.56s -> 7237.56s]  a pirate's cove there. And then there's an
[7237.56s -> 7240.57s]  arcade this way. This is gonna
[7240.57s -> 7243.71s]  have to come up a little more. Okay, that looks
[7243.71s -> 7246.52s]  alright. Yeah, that's
[7246.52s -> 7250.56s]  alright. And then this goes this
[7250.56s -> 7254.65s]  way. I know, I've lost eighty seven
[7254.65s -> 7256.65s]  hundred dollars.
[7256.65s -> 7262.60s]  You come in.
[7262.60s -> 7264.60s]  Free arcade machines.
[7264.60s -> 7273.68s]  And then there's the dining hall.
[7273.68s -> 7277.20s]  And then over here can be...
[7277.20s -> 7280.52s]  Alright, that's actually
[7280.52s -> 7286.48s]  okay for now. That's fine.
[7286.48s -> 7288.48s]  Alright, that's good for my arcade machines.
[7288.48s -> 7300.70s]  Why is this one little? Oh, that's a seat.
[7300.70s -> 7306.65s]  Alright, now we need a
[7306.65s -> 7309.98s]  movie theater.
[7309.98s -> 7311.98s]  No, a dance floor. No, no, no. Where is it? A media...
[7311.98s -> 7313.98s]  A stage, right? Cause it's Friday's Fast Burst.
[7313.98s -> 7320.51s]  Got it. Alright, small stage.
[7320.51s -> 7322.51s]  Oh, you motherfucker. Come on.
[7322.51s -> 7333.05s]  Come on.
[7333.05s -> 7352.43s]  Just have to move it. Fit in there. Small
[7352.43s -> 7356.91s]  stage. Alright.
[7356.91s -> 7358.91s]  It does fit right there, but this other side
[7358.91s -> 7360.91s]  has to move. And I'll put like trees
[7360.91s -> 7365.07s]  over here. Wanna make sure it fits.
[7365.07s -> 7374.73s]  Police are going to an opponent's place.
[7374.73s -> 7376.73s]  That's what I was saying. Staff are
[7376.73s -> 7378.73s]  asking for a raise. Uh huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7378.73s -> 7388.97s]  Yeah, that's fine.
[7388.97s -> 7392.49s]  So fucked up. These walls
[7392.49s -> 7394.49s]  are bad, okay?
[7394.49s -> 7396.49s]  It's not my fault that these walls suck.
[7396.49s -> 7398.49s]  They're so bad.
[7398.49s -> 7403.61s]  They don't even make any sense.
[7403.61s -> 7406.94s]  This shit doesn't even make any sense.
[7406.94s -> 7415.76s]  Let me just get it in there first.
[7415.76s -> 7421.00s]  Okay, there we go. Nice. How much was that?
[7421.00s -> 7423.00s]  $6,000. That's a lot of money. You wanna
[7423.00s -> 7426.52s]  raise? I'll get it somewhere else.
[7426.52s -> 7435.80s]  Actually, you know what? You wanna come work here?
[7435.80s -> 7439.07s]  Now I can bring this up.
[7439.07s -> 7441.82s]  Cause now the thing's actually in here.
[7441.82s -> 7446.36s]  There we go. Okay, nice.
[7446.36s -> 7449.24s]  I can put some seats in.

[12866.20s -> 12874.25s]  the i think it's gonna be gorilla so here's the i have a question so this is a oh let's just watch
[12874.25s -> 12880.86s]  public domain movies until we can't fucking take it anymore right should there be a scenario what's
[12880.94s -> 12889.76s]  the cutoff what's the cutoff if after 20 minutes or 30 minutes it's like this is sucks it's not
[12889.76s -> 12894.08s]  even funny it's not even interesting it's not scary it's terrible is there is there a cutoff
[12894.08s -> 12898.14s]  we can do after like 20 minutes to be like we gotta we gotta go or something we're gonna do
[12898.14s -> 12906.19s]  something way to move on to the next one 40 minutes and we're going to do at least one or
[12906.19s -> 12909.95s]  two i told you the way that i watch some movies sometimes is yeah we're gonna we're gonna we're
[12909.95s -> 12914.59s]  gonna do at least three or four of these at the the germa 985 technique i've told you about before
[12914.59s -> 12918.99s]  the germa 985 watch the movie technique that you don't give a fuck about is you skip 10 minutes
[12918.99s -> 12925.55s]  and watch 60 seconds skip 20 minutes watch five minutes skip 30 minutes watch two minutes skip
[12925.55s -> 12930.14s]  10 minutes watch 10 minutes that's that's the technique and you can get the whole fucking movie
[12930.14s -> 12944.60s]  that way we're gonna do that with with at least one or two of these you get the whole movie i'm
[12944.60s -> 12950.36s]  gonna have a bingo chart for the movie that might be fun too just to have like a bingo chart for the

[13590.89s -> 13595.68s]  just being there i don't talk much and chatter in the discord because i'm very shy but it's
[13595.68s -> 13600.44s]  always very comforting to come back and watch you live what everybody has to say in chat and
[13600.44s -> 13605.29s]  it always makes me feel like i'm not truly just alone and depressed in my room all the time hope
[13605.29s -> 13610.41s]  you're handling your condition well and sorry for the long and filthy message i love you guys

[13644.78s -> 13650.51s]  hanging out we are well we are absolutely happy to welcome anybody that wants to hang out here
[13650.51s -> 13654.91s]  that's kind of all i care about on this channel is having just people hang out
[13654.91s -> 13660.27s]  laughing talking shit about random stuff talking around is having a good time that's it that's
[13660.27s -> 13665.82s]  pretty much the number one thing but to know that it's somebody's doing that it means a lot
[13665.82s -> 13685.71s]  here was 35 despite looking 19 i look older than 19 i get i get carded at bars guys wait that means
[13685.71s -> 13696.62s]  oh that is what that means i don't know where my brain was going with that i think it was trying
[13696.62s -> 13703.68s]  to say i don't get carded but i do every time no matter what like i get carded because i look
[13703.68s -> 13711.40s]  younger than i do yeah okay so i'm wrong it's all right hey mostly lost thanks to the 250 i think
[13711.40s -> 13717.68s]  it's adorable how you always pronounce the full words when you see laughing my ass off lmao doesn't
[13717.68s -> 13727.31s]  sound correct to me lmao no that's i don't like that lmao i feel like i'm texting like
[13727.31s -> 13748.94s]  lol lmao brb g2g lmao no it's laughing my fucking ass off lmao lmao hey hot gamer thanks for the
[13748.94s -> 13754.94s]  five dollars this whole chat trashing beautiful joe kind of reminds me of when uh hideki kimiya
[13754.94s -> 13760.30s]  tried doing focus testing which was mostly composed of children lmao or beautiful joe in
[13761.18s -> 13765.55s]  they said i think the whole focus group thing is not the way to make a game because you start to
[13765.55s -> 13769.96s]  bring in other people's opinions and lose some of the originality for beautiful joe we brought in
[13769.96s -> 13775.16s]  some kids to do a focus test and asked them what do you think of the characters and all the kids
[13775.16s -> 13782.84s]  said oh his head's too big or silvie is annoying i just want to kill her they were just trashing
[13782.84s -> 13794.17s]  the game so i just got pissed off and said i'm not changing anything and i'm glad he did because the
[13794.17s -> 13800.73s]  game is fantastic it's the best game maybe you should try his method and play whatever game you
[13800.73s -> 13811.96s]  like regardless of what chat says i do that i do that though so times when i because you gotta
[13811.96s -> 13821.45s]  remember i do like to play the things that i want to play and i do it most of the time it gets to
[13821.45s -> 13828.72s]  be a point where it's very evident that people are just not don't want i don't like my goal here
[13828.72s -> 13833.72s]  when i broadcast is i want everyone to have fun and have a good time and i want to be having a
[13833.72s -> 13838.52s]  good time and when people are like this is boring or this sucks this is stupid i don't like this
[13838.52s -> 13843.36s]  game this game's and it's not just like three people it's like hundreds of them it's harder
[13843.36s -> 13849.00s]  for me to be like look at how much fun this is oh gosh check this out i'm having so much fun
[13849.87s -> 13859.56s]  hey everybody it's a fun time and you guys are not having fun i feed off of people's energy
[13859.56s -> 13863.00s]  right like i feed off of what you guys say and the things that you guys are laughing about or
[13863.00s -> 13871.05s]  talking about um that's that kind of i'm a creature of that kind of habit he's a demon
[13871.05s -> 13880.00s]  but call me whatever you want that's what a monster does that's call me whatever you want
[13880.00s -> 13886.80s]  but if i'm not feeling like the chat vibe and i'm not having fun having fun with you guys and
[13886.80s -> 13891.60s]  having you understand that we're you know having you guys have fun and there needs to be this like
[13891.60s -> 13896.08s]  mutual kind of understanding that what we're doing is what is fun to do because otherwise it's me
[13896.08s -> 13901.40s]  just like talking at a wall while people scream about how they hate what i'm doing and it feels
[13901.40s -> 13907.82s]  odd oh it got that power up nice okay what's that 10 000 power ups this game sucks this game's
[13907.90s -> 13913.66s]  fucking stupid jeremy this is so bad please do something else god this sucks so bad okay so
[13913.66s -> 13919.32s]  that's 10 000 points all right i guess oh i do a spin move there what are you guys saying what's
[13919.32s -> 13928.36s]  happening over here oh okay that's cool all right um nice so um guys this door here needs to be
[13928.36s -> 13937.87s]  yeah it's hard for me i i feed off of fucking chat the dreamcast sucks lab that's different
[13937.87s -> 13947.20s]  it's different you should do straw balls sometimes to see if chat really enjoys this
[13947.20s -> 13952.16s]  yeah but i also don't want to just hand you guys the keys to my car you know what i mean
[13952.16s -> 13955.76s]  if i want to if i want to do something and it's something i'm gonna plan to do like i'm gonna do
[13955.76s -> 13961.85s]  it i'm not gonna be like guys tell me what to stream every day like i'm not that's like i have
[13961.85s -> 13969.82s]  the keys to the car you guys are passengers in this car now i can take suggestions for where you guys
[13969.82s -> 13979.69s]  want to go but at the end of the day i'm the one with the wheel in the hand we're in the baby seat
[13979.69s -> 13993.64s]  maybe some of you are there's at least one of you that might be we're not gonna crash we're fine
[13993.64s -> 14003.60s]  i've got my eyes on the road but the point still stands is i like having that balance of you guys
[14003.60s -> 14009.44s]  having recommendations and influencing some of the stuff that's done but it's not just going to be
[14009.44s -> 14013.60s]  like i do polls in the pretty stream chat all the time it'd be like what do you guys think is what
[14013.60s -> 14018.75s]  do you guys want to do today they're like choices that i have made right anytime you guys have ever
[14018.75s -> 14025.93s]  seen a poll it's always been here's like three or four things that i would like to do and then you
[14025.93s -> 14030.32s]  guys like oh do this this sounds good this sounds fun i don't know about that one those are all
[14030.32s -> 14035.96s]  things that i want to do but i like that i would probably want to do but if i start handing you
[14035.96s -> 14042.62s]  guys the keys then it's like i can't um i can't really make decisions for myself anymore you know
[14042.62s -> 14047.77s]  what i mean it's like well i guess i'm not doing this because they told me i can't but i don't
[14047.77s -> 14058.84s]  want that to ever be a possibility it's gonna turn this car around yes no you're not getting
[14058.84s -> 14069.68s]  the keys why does it smell like piss because you pissed your pants you're sitting down and
[14069.68s -> 14079.74s]  it's sitting in your own pee or peed your pants in the car all right moving on that was hot gamer
[14079.74s -> 14085.02s]  for 500 bits thank you miami hotlines thanks for 250 hey king it's me again heart your casino is
[14085.02s -> 14089.95s]  still so ugly i might barf well we can add you to the list of the hundreds of people that barfed in
[14089.95s -> 14097.31s]  the casino so it's not really not even a big deal at that point thanks a lot though hole of one
[14097.31s -> 14102.35s]  zombie thanks for the 500 you mentioned you could live in a casino howard hughes actually did that
[14102.35s -> 14108.11s]  he also made his fortune from drill bits made movies like rat movie and he genuinely spent
[14108.11s -> 14114.68s]  most of his time naked in his hotel room not making that up germa hughes spruce goose bird house
[14129.85s -> 14136.73s]  i mean you can live close to casinos or close to the strip but nobody i mean unless you're like
[14136.73s -> 14144.25s]  a celebrity or an athlete or like uh boxers or ufc fighters have permanent rooms in some of the
[14144.25s -> 14148.81s]  hotels down there but people don't you don't like live in the belagio you don't like live in circus
[14148.81s -> 14166.06s]  circus you could but you don't people you don't or a streamer yeah or a streamer that'd be so weird
[14166.06s -> 14172.27s]  i would never want to live in a resort or hotel or something just think about that somebody does
[14172.27s -> 14180.03s]  your laundry somebody cleans your room every day i would lose so i you know oh yeah somebody's
[14180.03s -> 14183.95s]  going to come in and just do a bunch of shit for me in my room people take out you if somebody
[14183.95s -> 14193.31s]  else takes your trash out i feel like i would be i'd become so complacent and then you know i would
[14193.31s -> 14205.50s]  just turn into like a slug because then after like after like five years of that it's hard to go back
[14205.50s -> 14212.59s]  to like doing your own bed and cleaning your own sheets and taking your own trash out each human
[14212.59s -> 14224.73s]  slug would be living in a hotel it's true hey thank you pigeon for the 500 bits they say germa
[14224.73s -> 14234.08s]  read it's a very a germa the time has come for me to write you a very long letter okay let's see
[14234.88s -> 14248.78s]  uh i'll be 20 years old tonight okay happy birthday at 12 a.m have a good 12 a.m birthday
[14248.78s -> 14253.69s]  feels birthday man uh this marks seven years of my enjoyment of you and your content
[14254.25s -> 14260.44s]  i've written a letter written a paper about you i've met you in person in fact the symbol of the
[14260.44s -> 14265.00s]  moment is now the highlight of my room's decor yes you can show this what you do you have like
[14265.00s -> 14276.67s]  a picture of me and wait what is this this is like hanging in your room oh sick so there it is
[14276.67s -> 14285.96s]  yeah i'm a signer i sign no it's not like a fixed guys it's not like a picture of my face or
[14285.96s -> 14294.70s]  something oh wait is there one up here no it's a twitchcon badge it's not like he's got like a
[14294.70s -> 14303.18s]  shrine of my face i said people are gonna make fun of this signature but i'll show it because
[14305.10s -> 14308.78s]  people gonna i know it's bad i have such a shitty handwriting and everything
[14308.78s -> 14330.70s]  i'll just save this as where is it oh that's the blueprint for freddy fazbear's pizza
[14331.34s -> 14342.72s]  okay there we go so here look i have really shitty handwriting and it's kind of hard it's
[14342.72s -> 14349.23s]  really hard to draw when you're standing up and holding your hand underneath as a pad and i'm
[14349.23s -> 14354.83s]  very much aware that that i know i do a thing under the a and i didn't know this until very
[14354.83s -> 14362.67s]  recently that i just have subconsciously been stealing that from amazon that's how i do every
[14362.67s -> 14372.52s]  single one i've signed probably if i'm realistic i don't know is 80 things i always do the certain
[14372.52s -> 14380.03s]  the thing underneath the a and it's just fucking amazon and i just i don't just do it i'm just
[14380.03s -> 14394.97s]  like oh german okay whatever let's put a smile on that box god damn it and the smile well yeah i
[14394.97s -> 14401.79s]  don't know i just did it they say german nobody on the internet can offer what you do nobody can
[14401.79s -> 14407.93s]  pretend to you offer a hilarious and personal experience when i watch other streamers my
[14407.93s -> 14413.82s]  experience is immediately halted as a bit donation is read as it is given ironically reading the
[14413.82s -> 14417.42s]  donations which is supposed to serve to make the setting of twitch chat to streamer more intimate
[14417.98s -> 14422.52s]  but instead it works to disconnect those who aren't the bit messenger well i do have something to
[14422.92s -> 14433.47s]  do i will tell you this though that there probably always will be a disconnect i think that's
[14433.47s -> 14443.20s]  important to mention too and to remember as well that there's always going to be a disconnect now
[14443.20s -> 14449.52s]  it doesn't have to be a situation where i just hey thanks for the ten dollars okay bye right
[14450.46s -> 14459.71s]  but there will always be a disconnect between anybody who's ever really on this channel
[14459.71s -> 14466.35s]  and fluter did just say um that's not true plenty of other good streamers that is true too
[14466.35s -> 14474.06s]  but it's not just i'm the only person on the whole entire website that says thanks in a way or gives
[14474.06s -> 14477.58s]  some kind of attention in a way to people that give money to the stream there's plenty of people
[14477.58s -> 14484.40s]  that do that but there always will be a form of a disconnect between anybody on this channel and me
[14484.40s -> 14490.86s]  that's just kind of the nature of this whole platform but i do kind of see what you're saying
[14491.42s -> 14498.43s]  what do you mean i'm not as close to i'm not as close to people i'm not as close as people
[14498.43s -> 14507.52s]  to you as in real life well my understanding is we all are in this community together this is a big
[14507.52s -> 14515.15s]  place there's a lot of people here and personal attention is impossible it is i'll be up front
[14515.15s -> 14524.27s]  with you it's impossible there's no way for me to give any of you any real personal attention
[14524.27s -> 14535.31s]  ever give me attention okay sure but when you have a large community like this everyone kind
[14535.31s -> 14539.71s]  of everyone's kind of is in the same spot and everyone kind of thinks the same things are
[14539.71s -> 14548.19s]  interesting and just because i i can't and won't give anybody personal personal attention doesn't
[14548.19s -> 14551.87s]  mean that we all can't enjoy the same things together and have fun in this space that's what
[14551.87s -> 14559.72s]  it's for and of course if so if like if you go to a convention and i'm there we can hang out and
[14559.72s -> 14571.28s]  shoot the shit for a little bit right but we're in that same space disable donations you know
[14572.28s -> 14579.84s]  it actually took me a pretty long time to come to terms with stuff like paypal and bits and stuff
[14579.84s -> 14586.09s]  it actually took a long time i never had a paypal for bits or anything and when bits came then i
[14586.09s -> 14601.74s]  was very even reluctant to turn it on i'm constantly evaluating this stream like i've never
[14601.74s -> 14606.94s]  it's never well when you're not recently have i thought oh maybe i should turn off
[14606.94s -> 14613.60s]  donations and just like let's just hang out whatever and he's under constant evaluation
[14613.60s -> 14621.00s]  but i never want this stream to be a scenario be it up i don't i never want to be in a scenario
[14621.00s -> 14630.84s]  where people want to pay me money to talk to me it shouldn't be like that you understand i don't
[14630.84s -> 14643.15s]  that never sat well with me and i know that there's a lot of he hates scenarios i know i
[14643.15s -> 14652.72s]  say the word scenario scenarios one of my favorite words it's happening now and that been and that's
[14652.72s -> 14660.46s]  the thing when you get to a point when that's when that happens that's why i always want to
[14660.46s -> 14664.86s]  kind of evaluate where i am and what i'm doing and how comfortable i am doing the things that i do
[14665.58s -> 14673.80s]  remember i come from youtube where i would just make a video and there it is and if you liked it
[14673.80s -> 14680.62s]  you could tell me to go fuck off somewhere in the comments but we didn't it wasn't real time
[14680.62s -> 14691.39s]  and nobody really sent me any any direct personal messages that i addressed in video or anything
[14691.39s -> 14698.75s]  and then we get to the scenarios ah i said it again then we get to the thing where because more
[14698.75s -> 14705.60s]  and more people are on this channel and more and more people are sending money that i read at the
[14705.60s -> 14709.98s]  end of streams or read whatever well let's just say like you're talking about other streamers
[14709.98s -> 14714.54s]  you have to increase you're gonna put some you're gonna put the gate up and make it so it's harder
[14714.54s -> 14721.39s]  to do because you don't want the whole stream just to be talking to people for money that was
[14721.47s -> 14727.95s]  one of the main reasons why i moved this to the end of the streams because i don't i want to
[14727.95s -> 14732.99s]  broadcast and i want to like i said collectively do something fun and hang out and have fun
[14732.99s -> 14737.82s]  and enjoy ourselves together i never wanted this stream to be like for a dollar i'm just
[14737.82s -> 14742.96s]  gonna start talking to you you know what i mean i don't want that and i hope that doesn't sound
[14744.01s -> 14753.79s]  like like i'm some kind of dickhead or something i really hope it doesn't oh this is still yes i
[14753.79s -> 14767.26s]  do sign shit like that it sounds like you hate me no i just i never want it to get to a position
[14767.26s -> 14779.12s]  where the stream takes a back seat to just being paid money to just talk to you that's why i
[14779.92s -> 14782.88s]  i took it away from the middle of streams i put it to the end of streams i raised the
[14783.44s -> 14790.57s]  bit amount that needed to be read at the end of streams and but that can come off as well now
[14790.57s -> 14800.17s]  he's putting he's making us spend more money to say anything to him at all fuck that get you a
[14800.17s -> 14811.28s]  money no but but this channel already does this channel already makes a lot of money it does
[14811.28s -> 14816.73s]  that's very obvious and very plain for anybody to do any basic math to know how many subs this
[14816.73s -> 14826.27s]  channel has and i don't i don't want to like pretend like that's not happening but i also
[14826.27s -> 14833.31s]  don't want it to become the one thing that matters for me to just drain people to just send me fucking
[14833.31s -> 14840.44s]  money and i just hey thanks for the fucking 20 bucks you got to say the one thing to germa see
[14840.44s -> 14845.44s]  you later so that's why i do like to give some personal attention but then how far does that go
[14846.00s -> 14860.09s]  how far does that go in that regard right it's something that i like i said i constantly evaluate
[14860.09s -> 14870.14s]  quick clip it and cut the sensible part oh my god but anyways they say uh pin says uh please
[14870.14s -> 14874.54s]  keep working hard like you do know that every important and unimportant birthday i will somehow
[14874.54s -> 14880.67s]  make a time to celebrate me stumbling onto your channel all the way back in 2013 thank you
[14880.67s -> 14889.18s]  seriously they say also say uh sorry about structure i'm pretty high while i write this
[14889.18s -> 14902.64s]  it's all good it's all good dude fucking we but i really appreciate it i really do
[14902.64s -> 14910.76s]  that so the fact that somebody would write a letter like this to me it's shocking to me i
[14910.76s -> 14917.71s]  i still have trouble realizing and believing that this that people think that is surprising
[14918.59s -> 14931.74s]  so thank you for even considering that i'm somehow some major influence in your life thanks i i hope
[14931.74s -> 14939.64s]  you're taking something good or i hope you it makes you i don't know hopefully you can
[14941.84s -> 14947.84s]  enjoy this stuff going on here and maybe it maybe and maybe i shape one of your views or

[15114.88s -> 15120.92s]  the old one big difference they need to stick to making their games like that instead of how
[15120.92s -> 15127.58s]  resident evil 5 and 6 were the remake all right there you go i think they're leaning now i think
[15127.58s -> 15131.02s]  they're learning now that they should stick to what they've always been good at anyways have a
[15131.02s -> 15136.59s]  good night yeah resident evil 4 is really good too but resident evil 3 remake apparently sucks
[15137.52s -> 15144.16s]  help me help me i keep people tell me that the game's not good it's like a bad game and it's
[15144.16s -> 15149.76s]  not worth playing i keep i'm nobody tells me it's good i think i've heard by maybe one or two
[15149.76s -> 15153.04s]  accounts that it was like oh yeah that's rarely really good is it good should i do should i play
[15153.04s -> 15162.91s]  it it's not is it good it's fucking great it's good it sucks it's worth playing once it's not

[16056.36s -> 16062.20s]  250 i've noticed more people suggesting games and chat being unruly with your game choices
[16062.20s -> 16065.80s]  no offense but i think it's because you've only been playing boomer games in the past two months
[16065.80s -> 16071.26s]  i think doing a straw poll you pick streams once or twice a month could help well also there's
[16071.26s -> 16079.12s]  no games have come out the last three months besides like the last week what what what games
[16079.12s -> 16086.19s]  have come out in the last two or three months doom animal cross yeah but i've thought like
[16086.19s -> 16095.77s]  when doom come out why would i play the final fantasy 7 remake have you ever heard me ever
[16095.85s -> 16114.83s]  all i've said i've done is talk shit about that game there are new people here no not to get
[16114.83s -> 16123.23s]  uh i gotta rephrase that i have i've all i've done is make fun of the trailers and tell you how i
[16123.23s -> 16134.89s]  don't play final fantasy i'm not gonna play final fantasy 7 remake i didn't pay five bucks for this
[16134.89s -> 16146.04s]  bullshit i just i it's a what a fantastic okay backtracking barry coming in hold on a minute
[16146.04s -> 16172.96s]  is one of the most influential most respected series ever ever but i never played them never
[16172.96s -> 16181.53s]  got into them i actually really don't like turn-based rpgs they i find them boring they
[16181.53s -> 16186.65s]  kind of bore me and that's not just with final fantasy that's with everything that is a turn-based
[16186.65s -> 16190.89s]  rpg i'm just not into them i need the laser beam to go
[16193.47s -> 16204.27s]  dodge rolls i need fps any blood any characters that have funny voices time wait for an attack
[16204.83s -> 16217.56s]  what about chrono triggers the best game ever made it is to marry rpgs the best game ever made
[16218.36s -> 16237.40s]  it is those are both turn-based rpgs they are i know jerma could you say something like that
[16238.60s -> 16268.88s]  and have that opinion love those games so much i had to close my window hold on okay listen
[16269.60s -> 16276.81s]  important um i turn-based rpgs they gotta really do it for me chrono triggers one of the only
[16276.81s -> 16282.57s]  ones super mario RPGs one of the only ones you good you named the only two turn-based rpgs
[16282.57s -> 16291.63s]  that i actually liked to play i that's those the only two even played that many yes i have

[16629.04s -> 16633.93s]  in the history of video games it's the reason it's the reason why you have some of your games
[16633.93s -> 16640.57s]  today is because final fantasy paved the way for fucking everything it's like the dungeons and dragons
[16640.57s -> 16650.09s]  of modern fucking video games and rpgs and shit i know i know trust me i do i love it this is just
[16650.09s -> 16670.40s]  to prevent anybody from throwing a rock at my house that's dragon quest yo the remake is hot

[16771.68s -> 16780.44s]  doom this is so many this i have so many things i want to do that's the right answer apology in
[16780.44s -> 16788.03s]  bound valorant and i think my brain might be too small for valorant and plus you need to get like
[16788.03s -> 16795.21s]  a secret key you need to get a secret like what how do i how do i get a key for valorant
[16800.06s -> 16809.34s]  don't play valorant no don't play they would give you a key is it any good is valorant any good or
[16809.34s -> 16836.78s]  is it just like a it's just like a like a cartoon cs go don't play it it's called it's cuck strike
[16838.06s -> 16864.04s]  anyway i'm not gonna like it but i don't think i like it moving on hey sticks renegade thanks
[16864.04s -> 16869.64s]  to 250 hot take jackie chan stunt master is greater than resident evil 3 uh i would put a
[16869.64s -> 16876.83s]  rock defense up in front of your house hey dinosaurs rex thanks to the 250 also how did
[16876.83s -> 16880.75s]  you develop so much confidence confidence is something i've been struggling with for a while
[16880.75s -> 16886.09s]  now and i wanted to let develop more of it any advice for me and the rest of chat i think i think
[16886.09s -> 16892.44s]  i'm just honestly i think i'm just too fucked up to even care does that actually make any sense
[16899.56s -> 16906.51s]  i feel like i don't even think about like confidence or anything at this point because
[16907.61s -> 16915.28s]  i'm so my brain is so all over the place i don't have time to even think about it i don't even
[16915.28s -> 16920.24s]  think i am that confident considering uh backtrack barry just told you like four different things
[16920.24s -> 16930.56s]  about the final fantasy series in the span of about five minutes is that confidence or is that
[16931.20s -> 16946.01s]  i'm not sure no shame is no that's a lack of shame he's too stupid to be shy
[16949.66s -> 16955.96s]  i think here's where here's here it is right it's comfortable it's being comfortable confidence
[16955.96s -> 16960.68s]  comes from comfort because you're comfortable in any scenario that you can put yourself in
[16963.61s -> 16971.26s]  and how you get yourself more comfortable is the real question music is gone monkey
[16975.15s -> 16982.16s]  having no shame makes you a psychopath i took the psychopath test i'm only like 60
[16982.88s -> 16994.70s]  i'm only like 62 psychopath or something that i'm fucking 38 angel okay the test was 150 dollars
[16995.26s -> 17005.72s]  got it online but uh how do you how do you build confidence you just have to be comfortable in the
[17005.72s -> 17014.28s]  thing that you're doing and that takes time takes time that's really the only advice i can give you
[17014.28s -> 17025.71s]  because um i'm something wrong i skipped a bunch of bits here john cena is killed thanks to three
[17025.71s -> 17029.23s]  dollars i missed the whole stream because of work can you do the whole thing again i don't want to
