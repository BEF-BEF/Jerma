[0.82s -> 4.66s]  I'm not thinking about like the numbers and ga... I'm thinking about like the conference.
[4.66s -> 8.38s]  You know what I mean? That's all I care about. I just care about the Square Enix
[8.38s -> 13.70s]  video game live conference. Anybody getting hyped up in the chat in here? Anybody getting
[13.70s -> 25.48s]  hyped up in here? Yeah, I'm sorry. I've been drinking all day. This is just... I've been
[25.48s -> 38.46s]  drinking booze. So I mean like a big fucking glass of water IQ. Damn. Shave? Probably lay
[38.46s -> 44.10s]  after tonight. Alright, so we're gonna do one last break and then we're gonna do the
[44.10s -> 49.93s]  Square Enix conference. I'm gonna get myself in the right position. Let's get it on screen
[49.93s -> 54.57s]  just to have it here. That was MS-DOS stuff. It was fun. Glad we got to play some of them.
[54.57s -> 59.94s]  They were interesting. Now let's close this window out because we don't need it right now.
[63.19s -> 68.31s]  Glass of water. It's kind of peeing out on my intelligence. I bring in so many nutrients
[68.31s -> 76.94s]  and I just pee them out. Alright, where's that browser? We're gonna, yeah, T minus like 15
[76.94s -> 81.82s]  minutes, right? I can change my category again and not be like the guy that's sitting in
[81.82s -> 95.35s]  the wrong category. So this is, is it just, what's the, let's see. Is it Square? Twitch
[95.35s -> 115.86s]  like Square? What's like the actual Twitch page? Or is it Square Enix? Square Enix. Okay.
[116.68s -> 126.98s]  No, that's wrong. Pay no attention to this. It's wrong. I wonder if we're gonna get
[126.98s -> 155.91s]  anything good here. We good? Am I pulling it? Why not? It's weird. Is there a live feed
[155.91s -> 172.02s]  right now or is it not up yet? Let me see here. It should be up, right? Square Enix,
[172.02s -> 189.64s]  there it is. Yeah, it's live. So where the hell is it? Well, finally. Okay, that was weird.
[189.64s -> 198.26s]  Alright, Square Enix is coming up. I'll be right back to pee. See you guys in a second.
[198.26s -> 202.18s]  Good evening. Welcome to Square Enix Live. No, no, no, no. I'm not ready yet. Please
[202.18s -> 206.10s]  take your seat. I'm not ready for this. The show will begin in 15 minutes. Oh,
[206.10s -> 212.87s]  alright. Thank God. They had a countdown on the screen too. They're going all out.
[213.75s -> 223.80s]  Feel like I'm watching a live stream. I am watching the live stream. Something in the
[223.80s -> 233.03s]  water today. What's going on right now? Something in the fucking water. I'll be right back.
[233.75s -> 322.74s]  Where's the countdown? Oh, I thought we were going. What the hell's happening?
[323.46s -> 340.06s]  Alright, I'll go back into the E3 special event category. Square Enix. I can't wait for
[340.06s -> 346.30s]  Quiet Man to come back. We're not gonna get Quiet Man. They're gonna go bury that in the
[346.30s -> 357.24s]  landfill somewhere. 12 minutes. What am I gonna do for what? What do I do for 12 minutes?
[357.96s -> 375.53s]  Just hang out? Smart. Like, you're not getting that privilege back. There's absolutely no way
[375.53s -> 385.46s]  I'm gonna give that back to you. Tell us my favorite story. Jack and Jill went up a hill
[385.46s -> 391.30s]  to get a patch of water. Jack fell down and smashed his crown, and Jill fell down
[391.30s -> 396.74s]  afterwards and hit her head on a rock. Then they got up and they drank the water
[396.74s -> 410.25s]  and they were fine. Do I wear shoes indoors? No. Why? Okay. This is why I don't do face
[410.25s -> 413.21s]  games. I told you. Like, boogers almost just came flying out of my fucking nose.
[417.02s -> 421.10s]  Like, that's what we care about right now. It's like, oh, Square Enix. What are we gonna
[421.10s -> 425.98s]  talk about before the... Oh, AMD. Oh, right. Never mind. The markets aren't open.
[428.42s -> 434.18s]  This is what we talked about before. Conference. You have to act like we're there,
[434.18s -> 439.78s]  right? If we were in the audience right now, you and I together, we're hanging out before E3
[439.78s -> 443.62s]  and then here it comes. We got 10 minutes. Are you gonna lean over to me like these people
[443.62s -> 448.97s]  are leaning over and go, hey, do you wear shoes inside or do you just have bare feet?
[449.69s -> 463.99s]  It's like, what are you talking about? You're not gonna have that conversation.
[467.77s -> 473.58s]  I might ask you that. No, but you know you are. All right, I need to change the
[473.58s -> 482.70s]  lighting here because it's Square Enix. What's Square Enix's color scheme? Red and,
[482.70s -> 501.54s]  what is it, red? Look, I am there. I get to pretend that I'm here. Good evening. Where
[501.54s -> 506.50s]  would I be? Welcome to Square Enix Live. Welcome. You have 10 minutes. The show will
[506.50s -> 517.02s]  begin in 10 minutes. Sit down and shut up. Turn the lights off. It's the middle of the day
[517.02s -> 535.88s]  still here. The lights are off right now. We came to the movie early and I hate when this
[535.88s -> 539.56s]  shit happens. I don't like doing this. I don't like coming to the... Oh, no, get to the
[539.56s -> 545.37s]  movie. Let's get to the movie early. Because you go like this and you watch the same
[545.37s -> 551.70s]  fucking ad about like three or four car assurances. There's nobody in the seats.
[551.70s -> 563.80s]  And you're just like, okay. Just waiting. And then you gotta watch the previews. I always
[563.80s -> 575.50s]  show up like two or three minutes late doing that. Talk to your friends. Hey, I'm not doing
[575.50s -> 588.87s]  that. Have I seen Elden Ring? Yes, I have. I don't go to the theater by myself. I mean,
[588.87s -> 597.06s]  whatever you do, you do. The last movie... 7,500 people watching the countdown. Yeah,
[597.06s -> 605.77s]  we got to the movie too early and it's going really slow. I was gonna say fast,
[605.77s -> 611.13s]  but that was not true. Best game of E3 so far? I mean, it's easy to say Elden Ring.
[617.02s -> 620.46s]  We didn't get to see much of it, but it's one I'm probably most excited for.
[621.50s -> 630.38s]  Best game that they've actually shown gameplay of? I don't know. That's tough.
[633.74s -> 650.42s]  Yeah, Doom did look pretty good. Either Doom or... I kind of do want to say Watch Dogs 3
[650.42s -> 654.42s]  only because I want to be the grandma. It's not about the gameplay. It's about the character
[654.42s -> 666.23s]  that I get to play as. That's it. That's the only reason why is because of the grandma.
[666.95s -> 673.29s]  And that is extremely biased. They may as well... You could have the shittiest game ever made
[673.29s -> 676.65s]  and there's a clown character that you can play as and run around and punch people as a
[676.65s -> 682.73s]  clown. I would be... Right off the bat, I'd be excited for it. Just like, oh, I could be a
[682.73s -> 699.02s]  clown? I could be a grandma? That's fun. Cool. You just ate 500 grams of apricots. Well,
[699.02s -> 720.54s]  you're gonna have diarrhea in about 14 minutes. Is it too red or is it just red enough? Your
[720.54s -> 731.72s]  face will look lovely in that golden frame. Dude, I can't believe I'm here right now.
[733.18s -> 739.56s]  I'm facing the wrong way. Am I on the stage? Are they all here from, like, looking at me?
[742.23s -> 750.47s]  Hey! Well, there we go. Now I'm in the audience. This music is scaring me. Well, it's scary
[750.47s -> 787.16s]  music. Only five and a half more minutes to kill. Put that on your wall. All right. The
[787.16s -> 794.66s]  next... Every time somebody says Five Nights at Freddy's VR, I'm gonna fucking delete
[794.66s -> 804.78s]  one minute from tonight's stream. Good evening. Welcome to Square Enix Live. Please take your
[804.78s -> 809.50s]  seats. Wow! That's a lot of minutes. That's a lot of minutes. It looks like I'll be out
[809.50s -> 813.74s]  of here. I'm gonna have to be taken off after the conference, guys. Oh, and it's
[813.74s -> 816.94s]  about tomorrow too? Oh, you guys are deleting time from every... You know, I'm not even
[816.94s -> 838.07s]  gonna... Shit. What the fuck am I gonna do now? Delete the bots. I feel like I should be
[838.07s -> 842.87s]  doing something. I can't do this. I'm not very good at this. I'm very bad at just, like,
[843.67s -> 848.17s]  looking. I need to be, like, moving. Do you guys mind if I move around?
[848.89s -> 860.07s]  I can't look at, like, a countdown. We should have played Commander King for, like, an extra
[860.07s -> 869.58s]  20 minutes. What? Not Commander King. What the fuck is that game? Uh, Doctor... The
[869.58s -> 877.46s]  Island of Doctor Moreau, whatever it was called. I just gotta fucking move around. I just can't
[877.46s -> 882.31s]  sit here. I would be doing this in the seat too. I'd just be like,
[884.25s -> 898.81s]  go get a drink. I've already got one. Do a backflip. No, I ain't doing that again. I
[898.81s -> 906.49s]  gotta be drunk to do that. Three minutes of improv? All right, give me a topic. Quick.
[906.49s -> 910.41s]  Give me something. Give me something. Let me get a, let me get a setting. A setting. A place.
[911.21s -> 918.79s]  A place. A place. A place. Place. Place. Uh, okay, come on. Come on. Come on. E3. I got E3.
[918.79s -> 923.59s]  E3. Uh, give me, um... Give me a theme to E3. Give me a theme. What's going on? What's
[923.59s -> 926.55s]  happening at E3? Give me, give me something. Let me see if it comes up. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[929.99s -> 935.99s]  Uh, a game. A game. A presentation. A game. Square Enix presentation. Give me something else.
[936.63s -> 941.00s]  Give me, uh, give me, give me, give me a clothing style. Give me like what I should be wearing.
[947.74s -> 953.90s]  Fancy. Fancy. Okay, we got E3. We've got a fancy clothing style. We've got a presentation
[953.90s -> 958.46s]  for a video game. Uh, and give me, give me an adjective. Give me an, give me two adjectives.
[965.19s -> 971.54s]  Boring. Okay. The boring. Stalling. Okay. All right, so we got boring,
[971.54s -> 980.04s]  stalling, E3, game, conference. All right. Okay, let's see what I can do.
[981.00s -> 985.56s]  Boring. Boring, stalling, E3, game, conference, fancy clothes.
[990.10s -> 994.50s]  Stalling. No, okay. Okay, just give me a minute to prepare. Let me see what I can do.
[1011.38s -> 1038.09s]  Me, me, me, me, me, me. Okay. All right. I'm gonna, here we go. Okay. Boring, E3, conference,
[1038.89s -> 1051.50s]  fancy clothes. What was the last one? I should have done this joke two minutes
[1051.50s -> 1080.34s]  before. Not three minutes before. Stalling. Right. Self. Go in the frame. Quick. There.
[1095.53s -> 1105.06s]  10 seconds. All right. Here's, here's like the here's your improv joke. Here it comes.
[1105.06s -> 1154.78s]  Did it 45 seconds too early. Are they serving booze here? I hope it fucking blue screens.
[1154.78s -> 1221.38s]  That's so mean. I'll be, I'll be quiet. Please welcome Yoshinori Kitase, producer,
[1221.38s -> 1226.50s]  Final Fantasy 7 remake. Are we ever going to see what this game looks like? I feel like
[1226.50s -> 1241.83s]  they've been making this game remade like for the last 15 years. Project, gotta speak louder.
[1248.87s -> 1254.31s]  I am very happy to be able to introduce this long beloved title once again.
[1254.95s -> 1259.91s]  After 22 years, the familiar characters we love have returned while becoming more
[1259.91s -> 1277.91s]  beautiful and captivating than ever before. To our long time fans, we thank you
[1277.91s -> 1282.07s]  for your support and patience over these years, and we look forward to embarking on
[1282.07s -> 1283.11s]  this journey together.
[1307.91s -> 1322.23s]  Remaking Final Fantasy 7 has allowed us to dive much deeper into the world and its characters
[1322.23s -> 1326.15s]  than ever before. The game design was optimized for this title as well,
[1326.15s -> 1329.59s]  and we anticipate two blu-ray discs worth of gameplay content.
[1332.87s -> 1337.59s]  The first game in this project expands on the story of Midgar and is such an
[1337.59s -> 1341.75s]  elaborate retelling that it has become a solid standalone game in its own right.
[1354.71s -> 1358.63s]  Through the content we are about to unveil today, and through all that we have yet
[1358.63s -> 1366.12s]  to unveil, we will not disappoint your expectations. Your reunion with the Final
[1366.12s -> 1378.44s]  Fantasy 7 you know is near. To newcomers who never played the original,
[1378.44s -> 1382.76s]  we present to you a completely new Final Fantasy and a perfect starting point
[1382.76s -> 1390.28s]  to explore the world of Final Fantasy 7. Please welcome Neil Pabon, Senior Manager,
[1390.28s -> 1392.52s]  Product Marketing, Square Enix.
[1427.22s -> 1432.66s]  is a swing of Cloud's Buster Sword. Cloud attacks, dodges, and blocks all in real time.
[1432.66s -> 1437.14s]  His standard attacks do some damage, but they barely scratch the surface of Cloud's
[1437.14s -> 1442.34s]  true potential. Succeeding on the battlefield requires much more than just hacking and
[1442.34s -> 1449.86s]  slashing. Cloud needs to be tactical. He needs ATB. Two ATB bars are displayed in the
[1449.86s -> 1455.22s]  lower right. These fill up slowly over time, but fill much faster as Cloud lands
[1455.22s -> 1464.07s]  standard attacks. Once an ATB bar is full, you can enter a tactical mode where time slows
[1464.07s -> 1468.31s]  to a crawl and you have the opportunity to choose actions from the command menu.
[1468.87s -> 1473.27s]  Katase-san, I've had the pleasure of seeing you play the game, but tactical mode never
[1473.27s -> 1478.31s]  gets old for me. I could just sit here all day long and watch this beautiful slow motion action.
[1479.19s -> 1487.99s]  I think the audience would like to see more. Isn't that right, everyone?
[1490.78s -> 1495.90s]  Good point, good point. Well, once in tactical mode, you can choose to perform various
[1495.90s -> 1500.22s]  abilities, such as Cloud's Braver Attack. So you couldn't do this in the other one, right?
[1501.02s -> 1504.86s]  Using an item in battle will deplete an ATB charge, and if Cloud has the right
[1504.94s -> 1512.06s]  materia equipped and enough MP, he can use ATB charges to cast spells. Of course,
[1512.06s -> 1518.90s]  this being a remake, we're sure to see some familiar faces. The use of his iconic gun arm,
[1518.90s -> 1522.98s]  Barrett is able to target enemies at a distance. Barrett's standard attacks generate
[1522.98s -> 1528.66s]  ATB charges similar to Cloud, but his abilities are entirely different. Switching
[1528.66s -> 1532.34s]  between characters in combat is done with a single button press, which makes rotating
[1532.34s -> 1536.58s]  through party members a snap. Speaking of other party members, Katasia-san,
[1536.58s -> 1547.26s]  when are we going to see Tifa in action? Maybe soon. All right. Characters will continue
[1547.26s -> 1551.02s]  to fight even when you're not controlling them correctly, but it's up to you to choose
[1551.02s -> 1556.14s]  how and when ATB charges are used. You can maximize your effectiveness by switching
[1556.14s -> 1565.03s]  between characters or issuing commands to characters with full ATB bars. Every enemy
[1565.03s -> 1569.27s]  has a focus gauge that fills up as you do damage. When the gauge is full, the enemy
[1569.27s -> 1573.75s]  becomes staggered, and you'll deal bonus damage. Tactical mode evokes the command
[1573.75s -> 1578.23s]  selections from the original Final Fantasy 7 and allows players to enjoy battle while taking
[1578.23s -> 1584.31s]  the time to think strategically. For players who prefer fast-paced action, abilities and
[1584.31s -> 1589.43s]  spells can be bound to shortcuts for immediate execution. Shortcuts make combat extremely
[1589.43s -> 1592.63s]  dynamic, with the choice of using them is entirely up to you.
[1592.63s -> 1594.23s]  Have you ever played Final Fantasy 7?
[1598.23s -> 1601.59s]  That's right. The game has been made so that you can choose how to play.
[1601.59s -> 1603.19s]  I hope players get excited about this.
[1604.63s -> 1610.26s]  Well, that's a brief introduction to combat in Final Fantasy 7 Remake, and we look forward
[1610.26s -> 1615.88s]  to showing you a whole lot more in the coming months. For now, let's see how Cloud
[1615.96s -> 1618.36s]  and Barrett do against a more formidable foe.
[1619.80s -> 1624.10s]  All right, now show us Cat's Set.
[1650.34s -> 1656.98s]  This is more inclined to Final Fantasy 15, right? This is kind of how that game was played.
[1682.49s -> 1702.06s]  It looks pretty fun. Turn-based is really outdated now. Yeah,
[1702.78s -> 1721.51s]  it is, at least in a mainstream setting. No, it isn't. Not very many AAA companies make
[1721.51s -> 1726.47s]  turn-based games like this. What's a turn-based AAA game that's come out?
[1743.85s -> 1746.81s]  I wouldn't call Persona 5 mainstream AAA game.
[1747.77s -> 1762.44s]  Pokemon, maybe. It is now. Persona 5 sold a million copies.
[1800.84s -> 1855.06s]  It's a long fight. It's kind of cool, though. It's good.
[1858.50s -> 1863.30s]  There's nothing wrong with a boss battle. Boss battles should be harder, more interesting.
[1871.94s -> 1906.09s]  This is just a normal fight. I thought that was going the whole time.
[1906.09s -> 1917.83s]  I got to press the button, Crab.
[1927.43s -> 1930.47s]  All right, are we going to get a Cloud or Sephiroth cosplay on the screen?
[1935.03s -> 1946.07s]  Final Fantasy 7 Remake.
[1946.07s -> 1950.47s]  Thank you for joining us, Nomura-san. It is an absolute honor to have you here.
[1951.11s -> 1956.07s]  Kitase-san, how do you feel working with Nomura-san once again on Final Fantasy 7 Remake?
[1965.67s -> 1970.87s]  It depends. I might be interested. I didn't play Final Fantasy 15.
[1973.75s -> 1977.19s]  I'm happy to see that he's working hard on this game.
[1995.91s -> 1997.11s]  Nomura-san, please comment.
[1997.91s -> 2008.55s]  I've been waiting for a long time. Thank you so much for all the support you've been giving me.
[2013.03s -> 2019.75s]  This is the first time you've seen me play on the screen for a long time.
[2019.75s -> 2026.71s]  I think it was a little different from what I had imagined.
[2027.51s -> 2032.55s]  So first and foremost, we wanted to extend our gratitude to those who have been waiting so patiently
[2032.55s -> 2036.15s]  and have been supporting us for such a long time until now.
[2036.15s -> 2042.79s]  And also, we've taken a look at gameplay right now and we've fairly showed you a good bit.
[2043.51s -> 2051.83s]  So that's why I thought you'd all be interested in playing the game.
[2051.83s -> 2056.55s]  Would you like to actually play the game?
[2056.87s -> 2061.03s]  And I was wondering, do you guys want to actually play the game?
[2081.27s -> 2086.31s]  So we actually have playable demo kiosks available at the Square Enix E3 booth.
[2086.63s -> 2089.67s]  So I hope you have the opportunity to try it out.
[2108.95s -> 2110.15s]  What did that person yell?
[2111.03s -> 2117.43s]  So finally, there is something that we wanted to show you.
[2118.15s -> 2122.79s]  Yesterday, we showed you a short version of a trailer at the Final Fantasy 7 concert.
[2124.47s -> 2126.31s]  Today, we have a longer version.
[2128.31s -> 2129.59s]  You're giving me the trailer?
[2131.19s -> 2132.23s]  All right, please take a look.
[2133.11s -> 2141.16s]  Oh, this one already was out, yeah.
[2141.88s -> 2150.50s]  That's the popcorn.
[2173.90s -> 2177.26s]  These sewer rats appear to call themselves Avalanche, sir.
[2181.26s -> 2185.53s]  I'm saving my life.
[2186.81s -> 2192.42s]  You think he's a keeper?
[2193.06s -> 2193.70s]  Oh my god.
[2193.70s -> 2203.32s]  Have they shown-
[2203.32s -> 2203.82s]  Oh, red.
[2203.82s -> 2205.64s]  You all gotta look at the bigger picture here.
[2206.28s -> 2209.56s]  Nothing worth fighting for was ever won without sacrifice.
[2216.74s -> 2217.24s]  Not yet.
[2218.44s -> 2219.72s]  No red and no pizza, correct?
[2231.05s -> 2244.78s]  Oh, it's her.
[2325.18s -> 2325.68s]  Who's that?
[2332.81s -> 2337.69s]  Oh, it's Axel.
[2338.49s -> 2354.86s]  That's probably gonna be good.
[2355.50s -> 2359.50s]  If you're a big fan of Final Fantasy 7 and you've really, really, truly have been waiting,
[2359.50s -> 2360.78s]  you've been waiting for this for a long time.
[2361.66s -> 2364.62s]  There are a lot of people that have been seriously waiting for this.
[2367.42s -> 2369.10s]  It's taken like two decades.
[2371.05s -> 2372.33s]  And you get a motorcycle.
[2372.33s -> 2375.61s]  It's only like $64,000 for that whole collector's edition.
[2385.96s -> 2387.56s]  People are still screaming things.
[2409.40s -> 2411.32s]  A new chapter of Life is Strange?
[2420.06s -> 2421.26s]  Oh my god, this is so exciting.
[2423.10s -> 2424.22s]  Oh my gosh.
[2424.22s -> 2425.10s]  I love the setting.
[2425.10s -> 2426.14s]  It's so beautiful, man.
[2427.58s -> 2428.62s]  Time to hit the road.
[2429.50s -> 2432.66s]  I like the superpowers in the-
[2434.26s -> 2435.78s]  I'm not gonna give spoilers, never mind.
[2435.78s -> 2436.28s]  Sorry.
[2437.06s -> 2438.66s]  I wanna see what his power can do.
[2438.66s -> 2439.86s]  Come on, Daniel.
[2439.86s -> 2441.14s]  You got this.
[2441.14s -> 2442.66s]  He's starting to be able to control his powers.
[2450.84s -> 2456.74s]  What's going on?
[2459.06s -> 2459.70s]  What is that?
[2460.34s -> 2461.22s]  This is not part of the video.
[2461.22s -> 2461.70s]  What is that?
[2461.70s -> 2462.50s]  What the fuck was that?
[2485.34s -> 2486.38s]  It's still coming out.
[2487.90s -> 2488.86s]  It's still coming out.
[2502.46s -> 2503.58s]  It's coming out of my nose.
[2514.36s -> 2515.72s]  This game is awesome.
[2517.16s -> 2526.90s]  Isn't Life is Strange 2 already out?
[2558.36s -> 2559.00s]  What is this?
[2567.74s -> 2571.26s]  Never did I imagine that it could be so bright.
[2571.26s -> 2572.78s]  The Terminator has asthma?
[2574.30s -> 2575.18s]  What are you talking about?
[2579.32s -> 2580.60s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[2581.56s -> 2583.48s]  Keep the adventure close at hand.
[2583.48s -> 2585.88s]  The journey now unfolds on smartphones.
[2587.64s -> 2590.60s]  Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition.
[2591.40s -> 2594.28s]  This winter, embark on a new journey once more.
[2594.28s -> 2595.32s]  Eh, no, that's fine.
[2595.32s -> 2595.82s]  Whatever.
[2600.68s -> 2604.95s]  Lead us on our way.
[2604.95s -> 2605.83s]  This should be fine.
[2607.51s -> 2612.73s]  This world is full of mysteries.
[2619.86s -> 2621.06s]  Kind of just a lot of ads, huh?
[2621.94s -> 2623.98s]  This game's out.
[2623.98s -> 2626.54s]  Now the true lesser begins.
[2626.54s -> 2627.58s]  The hunt is on.
[2628.30s -> 2630.22s]  This is the beginning, your end.
[2630.22s -> 2632.34s]  I'm just fighting.
[2632.34s -> 2634.34s]  This will certainly be the end.
[2634.34s -> 2636.50s]  My blade protects those in need.
[2637.86s -> 2639.62s]  This entire event is an ad.
[2640.82s -> 2642.42s]  E3 is a giant ad.
[2642.58s -> 2643.46s]  Strike you down.
[2647.13s -> 2648.33s]  This is our chance.
[2648.97s -> 2651.05s]  Yeah, this whole stream is an ad.
[2651.77s -> 2656.49s]  Yeah, but yeah, like somebody just said,
[2656.49s -> 2658.17s]  normally it's an ad for new stuff.
[2660.44s -> 2660.68s]  New?
[2701.75s -> 2704.55s]  That's why they removed it from Steam.
[2704.55s -> 2715.22s]  That was on Steam, right?
[2715.22s -> 2717.06s]  And they removed it and it was like a big deal.
[2740.98s -> 2741.94s]  Is this cool?
[2741.94s -> 2742.58s]  Let's find out.
[2743.75s -> 2744.79s]  Dragon Quest Builders.
[2744.79s -> 2748.71s]  The Children of Hargon, the vile cult that worships destruction,
[2748.71s -> 2752.47s]  has outlawed the building, cooking, and creation of all things.
[2752.55s -> 2754.15s]  And captured the builders.
[2755.75s -> 2758.71s]  All hope seems to be lost until you,
[2758.71s -> 2760.23s]  a young apprentice builder,
[2760.23s -> 2762.63s]  manages to escape the clutches of evil.
[2764.31s -> 2767.35s]  Washed up on the deserted shores of the Isle of Awakening,
[2767.35s -> 2769.67s]  and with the help of your spirited and mysterious...
[2769.67s -> 2771.67s]  This is a really nice looking game.
[2771.67s -> 2774.79s]  It is up to you to doth your mallet and club,
[2775.51s -> 2777.74s]  unravel the rules of this land,
[2777.74s -> 2780.94s]  and defeat the hateful Children of Hargon.
[2780.94s -> 2789.29s]  Travel the diverse islands and discover your true potential as a master builder.
[2790.25s -> 2792.65s]  There is a land of adventure with many islands,
[2792.65s -> 2794.65s]  offering unlimited building combinations.
[2795.77s -> 2798.65s]  You will have to master new crafting skills on each island,
[2799.29s -> 2802.01s]  with more to do and even more to create.
[2805.98s -> 2809.66s]  Everything in Dragon Quest Builders 2 is much, much bigger.
[2810.62s -> 2816.92s]  Build huge structures in a larger world with more variety and options than ever before.
[2816.92s -> 2819.24s]  And with a little help from the eager islanders...
[2819.24s -> 2820.28s]  This kind of looks fun.
[2821.08s -> 2825.80s]  The world is humongous, and you'll need your wits about you to get around.
[2825.80s -> 2828.76s]  Run across open fields and explore ruins.
[2828.76s -> 2831.08s]  It is, and it looks like it could be.
[2831.08s -> 2831.80s]  It looks like it is.
[2833.00s -> 2837.22s]  Die in watery depths to discover hidden treasures.
[2837.22s -> 2840.02s]  Climb the highest mountains to catch the sunset.
[2840.10s -> 2844.90s]  And glide home to rest up for your next day of adventure.
[2848.23s -> 2854.07s]  But beware, monsters roam this land and will need to be dispatched with cunning composure.
[2855.29s -> 2859.69s]  Luckily, accompanying you on your quest is the enigmatic Malrog,
[2859.69s -> 2862.89s]  an aggressive amnesiac with a fondness for fighting foes.
[2864.25s -> 2868.33s]  Use powerful attacks on the battlefield to take down monstrous beasts.
[2869.13s -> 2869.63s]  Yay!
[2874.76s -> 2879.24s]  Work together with your villagers to till soil, plant seeds, and raise a multitude of crops.
[2879.24s -> 2880.20s]  Can you do this in multiplayer?
[2881.24s -> 2885.72s]  Be sure to customize the way you build your fields to support the kind of crops you're growing.
[2886.52s -> 2889.08s]  Harvest anything from the humble cabbage and wheat.
[2889.08s -> 2890.60s]  This is speaking my language right now.
[2890.60s -> 2891.80s]  Tantalize any tasty tomatoes.
[2892.92s -> 2896.94s]  It's harvesting fruits and shit.
[2896.94s -> 2899.02s]  Big projects require big, big help.
[2899.02s -> 2905.08s]  You and three friends can team up online to build anything you can imagine.
[2906.60s -> 2908.92s]  Let your creativity run wild.
[2910.28s -> 2916.26s]  The only limit is your imagination.
[2916.26s -> 2920.26s]  So call on your friends and build your fate together.
[2920.26s -> 2929.93s]  The road you build is paved with peril, young builder.
[2931.45s -> 2938.87s]  Only you can defeat the children of Hargar to destruction.
[2956.55s -> 2957.59s]  June 27th.
[2964.52s -> 2965.16s]  Luminary.
[2978.10s -> 2979.54s]  I've never heard of any of this shit.
[2981.06s -> 2991.75s]  I mean, I know Dragon Quest, but...
[3015.70s -> 3027.19s]  Dragon Quest 11.
[3028.47s -> 3038.87s]  Dragon Quest 11.
[3041.35s -> 3044.15s]  Do I have to see the first 10 Jason movies to understand Jason 11?
[3084.79s -> 3085.51s]  Quiet, man.
[3086.23s -> 3089.99s]  They're going to show three frames of Quiet, man.
[3090.71s -> 3099.19s]  Or do they leave it off the list?
[3099.91s -> 3104.09s]  No, they don't want to put that on the list.
[3114.12s -> 3116.28s]  This is Carolina.
[3116.28s -> 3117.08s]  Alberto.
[3117.08s -> 3118.60s]  And Carlos Mastretta.
[3118.60s -> 3127.14s]  We're a family of motorsport fans from Mexico, and we're the founders of Original Fire Games.
[3127.14s -> 3131.30s]  Over the last few decades, we have seen a fascinating evolution in racing games,
[3131.30s -> 3135.54s]  and nowadays you can drive almost any type of car on amazing recreations of the best
[3135.54s -> 3136.34s]  tracks in the world.
[3137.06s -> 3140.02s]  However, we will reach time to try something different.
[3140.58s -> 3145.22s]  We want to do this by reviving a style that pioneered racing games decades ago.
[3145.22s -> 3145.70s]  Bob Sledding.
[3145.70s -> 3151.22s]  The game mixes top-down racing with a classic sharp arcade look and tactile driving physics,
[3151.22s -> 3156.10s]  which brings together a whole range of styles and eras of motorsport.
[3156.10s -> 3160.18s]  We are delighted to share this moment with you and show a sneak preview of our game,
[3160.18s -> 3162.90s]  which Square Enix Collective will publish in 2020.
[3162.98s -> 3164.98s]  Join us for the ride and see you again soon.
[3175.05s -> 3175.85s]  Micro machines?
[3187.40s -> 3188.84s]  Reminds me of those little cars.
[3188.84s -> 3191.88s]  But you had the remote control and if you held down the button,
[3191.88s -> 3193.80s]  the harder you held it down, the faster it would go.
[3193.80s -> 3195.16s]  It would just fly off the track.
[3196.98s -> 3197.86s]  Is that what they're going for?
[3202.70s -> 3207.90s]  Battalion 1944 recaptures the core of classic competitive first-person shooters.
[3210.26s -> 3213.78s]  You'll need to quickly coordinate strategies with your team on the fly.
[3213.86s -> 3219.46s]  Whilst keeping your movement nimble and your aim precise if you hope to beat out the competition.
[3220.98s -> 3224.26s]  There are multiple game modes for you and your team to dive into.
[3224.98s -> 3226.90s]  Test your skills in domination.
[3226.90s -> 3229.38s]  Capture the flag or team death match.
[3229.38s -> 3233.46s]  And perfect your tactics in the highly competitive wartime game mode.
[3233.46s -> 3234.58s]  You know what this reminds me of?
[3235.94s -> 3236.98s]  Uh, like Day to Feet.
[3236.98s -> 3239.70s]  This competitive toolset is fully integrated into the game.
[3239.70s -> 3242.50s]  Bringing world-renowned competitive matchmaking.
[3242.50s -> 3243.62s]  Day to Feet was fun.
[3243.62s -> 3246.18s]  Tournaments, rankings, and leaderboards.
[3250.81s -> 3257.13s]  Kill enemies, win matches, and rank up to demonstrate your Battalion 1944 prowess.
[3257.13s -> 3259.61s]  And unlock visual customization rewards.
[3261.45s -> 3269.90s]  Each season will bring challenges for you to complete and medals to unlock.
[3269.90s -> 3271.90s]  Whilst tracking your in-game accomplishments.
[3271.90s -> 3276.86s]  And providing you with an easy way to compare them against your friends by in-game leaderboards.
[3277.42s -> 3280.41s]  Come on Terry, Terry you can do better than that.
[3280.41s -> 3284.09s]  Hold the Axis Offensive in their tracks with the rapid fire PPSH.
[3284.09s -> 3287.93s]  Or take fire with pixel precision with the Mosin Nagant.
[3287.93s -> 3292.25s]  And a whole host of new weapons just as deadly as their owners.
[3294.09s -> 3296.81s]  With a range of environments to test your skills in.
[3296.81s -> 3299.45s]  And a variety of weapons at your disposal.
[3299.45s -> 3303.13s]  Play as a team and compete to be top of the leaderboards.
[3303.13s -> 3304.33s]  They don't look bad.
[3305.29s -> 3309.29s]  It looks like a kind of no frills just shooter.
[3311.69s -> 3314.04s]  It's already out.
[3315.00s -> 3315.64s]  Okay never mind.
[3326.66s -> 3328.26s]  No frills shooter.
[3328.26s -> 3329.14s]  It looks terrible.
[3329.70s -> 3331.46s]  Look I'm trying to keep an open mind here.
[3331.46s -> 3332.74s]  I'm giving you what I really think.
[3333.94s -> 3355.78s]  He is going to blow her eardrum out.
[3379.54s -> 3380.66s]  I guess it's...
[3381.62s -> 3383.14s]  They just added it to...
[3384.10s -> 3386.07s]  They added their soundtracks?
[3387.11s -> 3394.86s]  Oh is this Mickey Mouse?
[3395.74s -> 3398.57s]  Why is there no voice acting?
[3398.57s -> 3420.92s]  Did that remind you of when they first showed that first trailer for Kingdom Hearts?
[3421.96s -> 3424.44s]  And it was missing music and audio files and stuff.
[3424.44s -> 3427.72s]  They're really not that great at making trailers for these games are they?
[3428.60s -> 3459.14s]  Quiet Hearts.
[3459.94s -> 3461.14s]  Kingdom Hearts 3.
[3462.66s -> 3463.46s]  Remind.
[3469.35s -> 3471.19s]  A developer could have just sat in and just
[3471.99s -> 3472.63s]  gone like this.
[3472.63s -> 3473.43s]  She doesn't have voice.
[3521.42s -> 3522.22s]  Shadowbringers.
[3523.26s -> 3524.22s]  Final Fantasy XIV.
[3531.22s -> 3533.22s]  That's like 50 weeks.
[3553.38s -> 3564.26s]  It's been six years since the release of A Realm Reborn in 2013 and over the years
[3564.26s -> 3567.86s]  we have surpassed 16 million total registered users.
[3567.86s -> 3573.30s]  Plus we have reached the highest number of active subscribers in its history before
[3573.30s -> 3574.90s]  the launch of Shadowbringers.
[3574.90s -> 3578.26s]  This is all thanks to our players, our warriors of light.
[3581.06s -> 3582.98s]  Registered users.
[3585.78s -> 3588.18s]  How many players does this ever need to have?
[3600.50s -> 3600.98s]  Two.
[3600.98s -> 3605.30s]  Play experiences that are comparable to a brand new standalone RPG title.
[3614.50s -> 3616.10s]  Over 9 billion served.
[3619.38s -> 3622.90s]  Over 100 billion capsules sold of our vitamin.
[3624.18s -> 3624.90s]  Bottles.
[3624.90s -> 3625.54s]  Capsules.
[3631.94s -> 3632.68s]  Skip this.
[3632.68s -> 3635.88s]  I don't have any master controls here to skip this.
[3645.00s -> 3648.60s]  We are excited to bring Shadowbringers as the latest installment in the
[3648.60s -> 3651.24s]  Final Fantasy franchise for our fans to enjoy.
[3651.88s -> 3656.76s]  At least until 2020 March 3rd when Final Fantasy VII Remake comes out.
[3661.40s -> 3661.90s]  March.
[3663.32s -> 3663.82s]  March.
[3665.88s -> 3667.32s]  We need the mind eraser from.
[3670.04s -> 3674.20s]  We are pleased to bring a world premiere of the launch trailer for Shadowbringers
[3674.20s -> 3675.08s]  releasing on July 2nd.
[3675.08s -> 3675.58s]  I'll help you.
[3695.46s -> 3696.10s]  God damn it!
[3696.74s -> 3697.62s]  I did it to myself.
[3702.58s -> 3703.30s]  Square Enix.
[3707.19s -> 3708.39s]  What happened to Square Soft?
[3711.37s -> 3712.97s]  Between realms.
[3712.97s -> 3716.01s]  Time, space, war, and land in...
[3716.01s -> 3716.97s]  Holy shit.
[3719.91s -> 3721.51s]  Graphics approved.
[3721.51s -> 3726.50s]  What O'Riorge saw was the future.
[3730.41s -> 3741.91s]  That's how the Zenitists came to be.
[3742.79s -> 3748.47s]  They were once living creatures with people that were caught in the path of the flood.
[3748.47s -> 3750.23s]  I certainly do not know how to do math.
[3750.23s -> 3759.34s]  There is no going back.
[3759.34s -> 3763.42s]  The eternal light of these creatures has confounded us for nigh on a hundred years.
[3764.06s -> 3767.74s]  For each we have put down, another has risen up in its place.
[3768.30s -> 3772.14s]  Born of the self-sane Aether relinquished by its predecessor.
[3773.42s -> 3780.73s]  He's having another episode.
[3783.00s -> 3783.50s]  That's him.
[3784.44s -> 3785.74s]  That's Valkyrie.
[3789.42s -> 3792.22s]  Zenitists are part of Yulmur society.
[3793.64s -> 3795.64s]  But they must be fed with Aether.
[3796.84s -> 3798.20s]  Living Aether.
[3813.18s -> 3814.94s]  This world's beyond saving.
[3816.38s -> 3820.34s]  Like those who try to save it.
[3820.34s -> 3823.46s]  This world has had its fill of heroes.
[3829.93s -> 3831.13s]  Wizard 202.
[3831.93s -> 3852.79s]  He gave.
[3853.91s -> 3855.99s]  What was it for?
[3857.27s -> 3865.90s]  I like that guy.
[3871.43s -> 3897.10s]  We did for this moment nothing.
[3907.32s -> 3909.72s]  Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers.
[3909.72s -> 3911.16s]  And sacrifice.
[3911.16s -> 3914.68s]  The will of the star was made manifest.
[3914.68s -> 3915.48s]  I'm staying on script.
[3915.48s -> 3915.96s]  I'm sorry.
[3915.96s -> 3917.88s]  I can only assume I misheard.
[3917.88s -> 3923.64s]  But it sounded an awful lot like you were implying both Zodiark and Hydaelyn are not gods.
[3923.64s -> 3926.76s]  But they are gods after a fashion.
[3926.76s -> 3927.26s]  Yes.
[3928.20s -> 3934.31s]  The eldest and most powerful of primals.
[3935.67s -> 3942.28s]  I had no idea what was going on that whole time.
[3943.08s -> 3947.14s]  They like just opened a book two-thirds of the way through it instead of reading.
[3958.04s -> 3958.54s]  Techland.
[3958.54s -> 3984.16s]  Dying Light?
[3984.16s -> 3990.01s]  No this is um this is the other zombie game.
[3991.32s -> 3992.04s]  There are a lot of them.
[3996.56s -> 4011.15s]  No no no.
[4011.15s -> 4011.79s]  Dead Island.
[4027.18s -> 4034.09s]  That was so different than the last Dying Light trailer that I can't believe that's the same game.
[4038.59s -> 4041.47s]  That was the parkour jumping around and flying around like that.
[4041.47s -> 4043.07s]  That was they were two different games.
[4065.13s -> 4066.25s]  Say the funny line.
[4088.94s -> 4090.54s]  I'm not gonna say the line.
[4106.54s -> 4107.02s]  Saga?
[4113.53s -> 4117.21s]  No I don't want to be I don't want to be like the washed up actor at the fucking convention.
[4117.77s -> 4119.13s]  That everyone's just like do it!
[4119.13s -> 4120.57s]  He's like okay I'll get after it.
[4121.29s -> 4123.45s]  Coffee, Cheetos, Chicken!
[4123.45s -> 4124.49s]  Everybody screams.
[4124.49s -> 4125.21s]  I don't want to do that.
[4136.88s -> 4139.84s]  The guy that just goes to every comic con and he has like the one line.
[4151.53s -> 4152.09s]  He did it.
[4152.09s -> 4152.73s]  Let's go.
[4156.06s -> 4157.74s]  That's all you were here for.
[4157.74s -> 4159.58s]  Time to get in line for the next signing.
[4160.80s -> 4162.08s]  Oh what's your name again?
[4162.96s -> 4164.00s]  Oh Gregory.
[4164.00s -> 4165.60s]  Cheetos and Chicken.
[4165.60s -> 4168.72s]  I write it on every single fucking person's pamphlet.
[4169.36s -> 4170.96s]  Who's your name?
[4171.85s -> 4172.41s]  Diane.
[4172.41s -> 4172.97s]  Diane.
[4173.61s -> 4176.01s]  Copy Cheetos.
[4176.01s -> 4180.17s]  Enjoyed by fans the world over has surpassed 39 million downloads.
[4182.14s -> 4188.62s]  Now Square Enix proudly presents the international reveal of a new title born from the FFBE universe.
[4189.50s -> 4193.05s]  War of the Visions.
[4193.05s -> 4195.29s]  Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.
[4196.49s -> 4203.21s]  These two titles FFBE and War of the Visions will be the pillars of the growing world of Lapis.
[4203.21s -> 4204.41s]  War of the Visions.
[4204.41s -> 4206.89s]  Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.
[4207.85s -> 4213.80s]  This is the story of Ardora, a continent of Lapis.
[4214.68s -> 4220.28s]  A tiny spark here ignites the flames that would embroil the entire continent in conflict.
[4222.78s -> 4223.34s]  Conflict.
[4224.46s -> 4227.58s]  By the way guys the entire continent is in conflict.
[4227.58s -> 4229.10s]  The whole continent, everything, everywhere.
[4229.10s -> 4241.55s]  War of the Visions possesses the power of visions as well as twin princes.
[4242.75s -> 4251.31s]  The great western kingdom governed by a policy of peace and its brave and wise king.
[4253.23s -> 4260.89s]  Venice where the king of the savages has organized the barbarian tribes into Ardora's
[4260.89s -> 4262.25s]  mightiest militant state.
[4263.13s -> 4271.47s]  Weset the great eastern kingdom over which reigns its icy desolate.
[4272.43s -> 4275.08s]  How many more kingdoms are there?
[4275.64s -> 4280.20s]  Crystal Sanctum, a religious city-state with believers throughout Ardora.
[4280.20s -> 4282.68s]  Founded by one who claims to be god.
[4282.68s -> 4283.96s]  Can't you all get along?
[4283.96s -> 4285.08s]  How many kingdoms you got?
[4285.08s -> 4287.40s]  Each burden with its own dignity.
[4287.40s -> 4292.20s]  Thus is the curtain drawn on a struggle in which the fate of the nations rests.
[4296.12s -> 4297.96s]  Is for one's homeland.
[4299.48s -> 4304.52s]  War of the Visions.
[4304.52s -> 4307.48s]  Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.
[4307.64s -> 4308.44s]  War of the Visions.
[4308.44s -> 4309.96s]  Now in development.
[4309.96s -> 4312.52s]  Final Fantasy Constant Conflict.
[4322.57s -> 4323.05s]  All right.
[4324.33s -> 4324.65s]  Okay.
[4340.86s -> 4380.32s]  Impressive.
[4381.02s -> 4382.64s]  Impressive.
[4387.52s -> 4388.40s]  Outriders.
[4391.95s -> 4392.99s]  Welcome to E3.
[4393.71s -> 4396.94s]  Where all of our trailers could be any fucking game.
[4398.72s -> 4401.12s]  Close up of somebody's like burnt scratched face.
[4402.67s -> 4405.87s]  Long shot of three or four of us standing in front of different buildings.
[4408.86s -> 4410.14s]  And laser gunfire.
[4413.56s -> 4414.92s]  Guess what it could be.
[4414.92s -> 4415.40s]  Who knows?
[4418.20s -> 4421.08s]  Please welcome Sebastian Wojciechowski.
[4421.64s -> 4422.76s]  Studio head.
[4422.76s -> 4423.72s]  People can fly.
[4425.08s -> 4436.57s]  Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
[4436.57s -> 4438.33s]  I'm Sebastian Wojciechowski.
[4438.33s -> 4439.61s]  Studio head that people can fly.
[4440.25s -> 4442.97s]  The studio behind Bulletstorm and Geese of War Judgment.
[4444.52s -> 4445.00s]  Yeah.
[4445.00s -> 4447.48s]  Any Bulletstorm fans in the house?
[4447.48s -> 4448.84s]  Which one of these didn't cancel?
[4449.32s -> 4449.80s]  Wow.
[4449.80s -> 4450.44s]  Let me tell you.
[4450.44s -> 4451.48s]  It feels great to be here.
[4451.48s -> 4454.20s]  It's amazing to be able to finally announce.
[4454.84s -> 4455.40s]  Outriders.
[4455.40s -> 4456.44s]  The whole person was happy about that.
[4458.32s -> 4459.68s]  Looks like Bulletstorm in here.
[4460.56s -> 4463.44s]  I'd like to thank the team at People Can Fly.
[4463.44s -> 4464.64s]  You guys are amazing.
[4464.64s -> 4467.20s]  And I know that some of you are watching this live.
[4467.20s -> 4470.24s]  Even though it's 4 a.m. in the morning in Poland.
[4470.24s -> 4473.28s]  So make a noise for them please.
[4477.45s -> 4478.01s]  Thank you.
[4478.01s -> 4480.33s]  You should tell us to wake everybody up across the world.
[4480.33s -> 4484.25s]  For the help and support as we work together on this exciting new IP.
[4485.05s -> 4487.21s]  You know over the past few years.
[4487.21s -> 4490.73s]  People Can Fly has grown to over 200 developers.
[4490.73s -> 4493.05s]  And four studios across Poland.
[4493.05s -> 4494.09s]  The UK.
[4494.09s -> 4495.77s]  And most recently the U.S.
[4495.77s -> 4499.29s]  To bring you what is our most ambitious shooter to date.
[4500.33s -> 4501.21s]  To present more.
[4501.77s -> 4506.00s]  To present more of our vision.
[4506.00s -> 4509.20s]  I would like to take this moment to introduce a short video.
[4509.20s -> 4510.24s]  From our game director.
[4510.24s -> 4510.80s]  Am I right?
[4510.80s -> 4511.60s]  Bartek Mita.
[4512.24s -> 4513.04s]  So thanks a lot.
[4513.60s -> 4515.44s]  More on Outriders this winter.
[4516.16s -> 4516.56s]  Thank you.
[4532.09s -> 4533.29s]  Shooters are in our DNA.
[4535.23s -> 4536.11s]  It's our passion.
[4537.72s -> 4539.32s]  And it's what we do.
[4539.32s -> 4540.60s]  Didn't your room get any darker?
[4540.60s -> 4545.72s]  Outriders draws on all our experience from all our previous titles.
[4549.90s -> 4553.50s]  It's a game we wanted to make for a very long time.
[4554.22s -> 4562.72s]  We describe Outriders as a dark model shooter.
[4563.20s -> 4565.28s]  Built with traditional bodies.
[4566.32s -> 4570.72s]  By that I mean we are creating an experience with a strong story.
[4570.72s -> 4573.44s]  That you can enjoy with your friends or on your own.
[4574.24s -> 4576.81s]  We want to tell a complete story.
[4577.53s -> 4578.73s]  I already forgot.
[4578.73s -> 4579.69s]  We are confident.
[4579.69s -> 4582.81s]  We are building a shooter with a powerful gunplay.
[4582.81s -> 4583.69s]  Sliders.
[4583.69s -> 4584.81s]  Incredible weaponry.
[4585.93s -> 4587.45s]  Long sliders what is it called?
[4588.41s -> 4590.41s]  We want to spend many hours in.
[4593.47s -> 4596.51s]  It's a game we've had in our heads ever since.
[4597.87s -> 4598.99s]  Outsiders?
[4598.99s -> 4599.23s]  No.
[4600.75s -> 4605.71s]  Outriders is a one-two or three-player drop-in drop-out cop shooter.
[4606.99s -> 4609.79s]  In our game you recreate your own Outrider.
[4609.79s -> 4612.51s]  And journey across the hostile planet of Dino.
[4612.51s -> 4616.75s]  In search of the source of a new strategy.
[4616.75s -> 4619.31s]  It's a pretty dark and unforgiving world.
[4619.31s -> 4622.03s]  And yes there is a lot more depth to the game.
[4622.03s -> 4624.11s]  But I can't say too much more right now.
[4624.83s -> 4633.04s]  Is William Neeson jumping over a fence or what's going on here with these cuts?
[4633.92s -> 4636.48s]  Come on that was that was that was fucking with it.
[4637.36s -> 4654.67s]  No gameplay unfortunately we don't get that.
[4655.47s -> 4665.77s]  Reincarnation is the foundation of our way of life.
[4665.77s -> 4668.89s]  For a second I think somebody about to make your room smaller.
[4668.89s -> 4669.93s]  How the fuck am I going to do that?
[4669.93s -> 4672.41s]  And offer up prayers for the next.
[4673.76s -> 4676.72s]  It is grief of death which shackles the living.
[4677.36s -> 4679.36s]  And causes the dead to stray.
[4680.48s -> 4685.04s]  Indeed there is no greater affront to reincarnation.
[4686.24s -> 4690.64s]  So we turn our grief to joy as we send off the dead.
[4699.72s -> 4703.16s]  But the souls of those who held back their tears in life.
[4703.96s -> 4706.84s]  Still need salvation in death.
[4706.84s -> 4708.44s]  This is a new PS Vita game?
[4709.24s -> 4712.68s]  A duty that falls to the Watchers.
[4712.68s -> 4714.12s]  PS Vita is discontinued.
[4714.44s -> 4720.20s]  The Watchers sever the bonds that tie the lost to this world.
[4721.00s -> 4723.24s]  And send them off to the next.
[4723.24s -> 4725.00s]  They've been working on this for a long time.
[4725.00s -> 4728.20s]  Unfortunately the code was already there for this to be on the Vita.
[4731.90s -> 4735.18s]  They prize life above all else.
[4737.26s -> 4744.59s]  Looks pretty fun.
[4744.59s -> 4745.47s]  This looks pretty cool.
[4746.35s -> 4747.23s]  Alright everybody hold on.
[4747.23s -> 4750.60s]  This is the story of one Watcher.
[4764.35s -> 4765.39s]  I'm not even going to taste.
[4766.27s -> 4768.86s]  That's the thing that sucks about a lot of E3.
[4768.86s -> 4771.42s]  Like they don't even give you a taste of what this is going to be.
[4771.42s -> 4774.22s]  They just put the flavor in a fucking diluted spray bottle
[4774.22s -> 4776.70s]  and like spray you in the face twice.
[4776.70s -> 4777.50s]  And then they run.
[4778.22s -> 4783.40s]  Does that mean I want to taste it?
[4792.32s -> 4793.20s]  Final Fantasy.
[4797.20s -> 4798.24s]  This is Final Fantasy VIII.
[4801.52s -> 4802.56s]  Final Fantasy Skate.
[4803.44s -> 4804.56s]  Final Fantasy Skate.
[4805.36s -> 4823.23s]  Final Fantasy VIII.
[4823.23s -> 4832.27s]  Is this a, are we getting a re-release onto Steve or something?
[4832.27s -> 4841.46s]  This week?
[4841.46s -> 4857.87s]  Final Fantasy VIII.
[4857.87s -> 4858.37s]  Green map.
[4858.75s -> 4860.11s]  Green map.
[4860.11s -> 4861.31s]  That didn't look very green actually.
[4862.03s -> 4869.18s]  That looked pretty, that looked really similar to what it looked like when it released didn't it?
[4874.35s -> 4883.48s]  Well this, okay hold on.
[4883.48s -> 4884.20s]  This is the Marvel game.
[4885.00s -> 4891.74s]  The Avengers.
[4892.30s -> 4910.92s]  Thor.
[4910.92s -> 4911.96s]  Tony check it out.
[4911.96s -> 4912.92s]  At once.
[4912.92s -> 4913.56s]  Try to keep up.
[4915.24s -> 4919.39s]  Who's the villain?
[4919.39s -> 4920.91s]  She's just got a whole lot more interesting.
[4921.47s -> 4922.67s]  Or is it a group of villains?
[4922.67s -> 4929.74s]  That was just a guy.
[4931.40s -> 4932.28s]  That was the pilot.
[4948.12s -> 4948.76s]  He's just.
[4948.76s -> 4949.40s]  Is that a joke?
[4950.20s -> 4951.40s]  He's like a superhero power.
[4954.81s -> 4956.09s]  They got pulsar tanking.
[4956.09s -> 5009.12s]  Oh shit.
[5009.12s -> 5010.40s]  Some say they were set up.
[5011.20s -> 5017.04s]  Others call them murderers.
[5017.04s -> 5019.52s]  Do the Avengers pose a danger to society?
[5019.52s -> 5020.80s]  That was the question Bruce.
[5021.52s -> 5022.56s]  That was the question.
[5024.00s -> 5028.56s]  Well why did Thor have a lowly Halloween costume on his chest?
[5032.20s -> 5033.88s]  That's not how this story ends.
[5055.23s -> 5056.91s]  Well what are we waiting for?
[5058.51s -> 5062.99s]  Is it Galactus?
[5063.87s -> 5065.60s]  Oh he's huge.
[5068.36s -> 5071.16s]  Please welcome Sean Eskai.
[5071.16s -> 5073.80s]  Creative director Crystal Dynamics.
[5073.80s -> 5075.40s]  And Bill Roseman.
[5075.40s -> 5078.76s]  Vice president and creative director Marvel games.
[5090.03s -> 5091.88s]  Thank you.
[5094.20s -> 5094.76s]  We love you.
[5095.98s -> 5096.54s]  Yeah.
[5096.54s -> 5100.27s]  Thank you.
[5100.27s -> 5101.55s]  Thank you everyone.
[5101.55s -> 5106.03s]  We are incredibly excited to reveal Marvel's Avengers to the world.
[5106.03s -> 5107.15s]  They look like they're gonna fuse.
[5108.92s -> 5110.76s]  I don't like this whole weird stage setup.
[5111.72s -> 5113.10s]  A few years ago.
[5113.10s -> 5116.38s]  The curtain's gonna go up and it's gonna be like a trans-blogger fire behind them.
[5116.38s -> 5117.66s]  Original Avengers game.
[5118.86s -> 5121.26s]  One that combined epic action adventure.
[5121.26s -> 5122.14s]  They're gonna switch brains.
[5122.30s -> 5129.90s]  A game where we as players can experience in both single player and co-op what it's
[5129.90s -> 5132.30s]  like to be Earth's mightiest heroes.
[5133.74s -> 5136.33s]  Do I have any true believers in the house?
[5137.53s -> 5139.77s]  Yeah awesome.
[5140.49s -> 5145.37s]  Because you will instantly recognize your favorite superheroes and villains.
[5145.37s -> 5148.97s]  But you'll also see that they're unique to this game.
[5148.97s -> 5153.21s]  As this is Crystal's interpretation of these iconic characters.
[5154.57s -> 5157.13s]  Our story begins at A day.
[5157.13s -> 5157.85s]  What does that mean?
[5157.85s -> 5161.37s]  San Francisco celebrates the opening of the Avengers West Coast headquarters.
[5162.17s -> 5167.85s]  And the team's custom helicarrier outfitted with a strange experimental energy source.
[5168.89s -> 5173.37s]  However the day turns deadly when an attempt to steal this new technology
[5173.93s -> 5175.77s]  results in massive destruction.
[5176.97s -> 5182.01s]  Blamed for the tragedy the Avengers are outlawed and our heroes disband.
[5182.97s -> 5188.19s]  Five years later a horrific evil threatens the world.
[5188.83s -> 5193.15s]  And our only hope is to reassemble Earth's mightiest heroes.
[5194.59s -> 5200.27s]  You'll play as your favorite Avengers in an all new original story.
[5200.91s -> 5205.15s]  Showcasing authentic Marvel heroism and humanity.
[5206.11s -> 5211.95s]  It's about losing what matters to you most and fighting to get it back.
[5211.95s -> 5214.67s]  I wonder what the villain's gonna be.
[5220.67s -> 5222.91s]  I feel like he got that from a Hallmark card.
[5225.15s -> 5227.76s]  That was like a pretty good tagline.
[5228.48s -> 5232.96s]  Most importantly this is a story about self-acceptance in the face of adversity.
[5233.84s -> 5239.92s]  About embracing our individual powers and learning that together we are mighty.
[5245.31s -> 5249.55s]  You'll lead the team as the legendary super soldier Captain America.
[5250.35s -> 5253.07s]  This is a work email I got like five years ago.
[5253.07s -> 5257.15s]  You'll call down the lightning as the Asgardian god of thunder Thor.
[5260.24s -> 5265.04s]  You'll channel the anger of scientist Bruce Banner by unleashing the Hulk.
[5267.68s -> 5273.36s]  You'll gather intel and strike swiftly as the ultimate tactical spy Black Widow.
[5275.58s -> 5280.94s]  And finally you'll blast through the sky as a charismatic Tony Stark.
[5281.90s -> 5286.06s]  Known to the wider world as the armored iron man.
[5287.18s -> 5295.07s]  To bring this incredible story to life we've assembled an all-star cast.
[5296.19s -> 5298.03s]  I'll let them introduce themselves.
[5303.47s -> 5307.20s]  Here they come Robert Downey Jr.
[5307.20s -> 5308.40s]  So here we are.
[5308.40s -> 5309.44s]  Avengers assembled.
[5310.08s -> 5310.80s]  Chris Evans.
[5310.80s -> 5311.76s]  Who are you people again?
[5315.04s -> 5317.36s]  Hi I'm Troy Baker and I play Bruce Banner.
[5318.08s -> 5320.48s]  Hi I'm Jeff Schein and I play Captain America.
[5321.04s -> 5323.04s]  Hi I'm Travis Willingham and I play Thor.
[5323.68s -> 5325.84s]  Hi I'm Laura Bailey and I'm playing Black Widow.
[5326.88s -> 5329.12s]  Hi I'm Nolan North and I play Tony Stark.
[5329.12s -> 5333.04s]  There's certain characters I don't think you ever have to be uh talked into.
[5333.84s -> 5336.32s]  You know so we'd like to have you play Tony Stark Iron Man.
[5336.32s -> 5336.80s]  Yeah yes.
[5338.80s -> 5341.36s]  We are we are the Avengers of voice acting.
[5341.36s -> 5342.88s]  We're in every fucking single game.
[5342.88s -> 5345.52s]  We are the Avengers of voice acting and games.
[5345.60s -> 5347.84s]  I think he's one of the most vulnerable guys.
[5347.84s -> 5351.20s]  I think Bruce is just such a cool character.
[5351.20s -> 5354.88s]  A lot of people are really quick to bring out the big green
[5354.88s -> 5359.84s]  but I think that that Bruce is a super complex character.
[5359.84s -> 5362.00s]  He's fun and I've never played him before.
[5362.00s -> 5366.64s]  What is very relatable about Natasha is she's extremely capable
[5366.64s -> 5369.28s]  but she's at the core she's human.
[5369.28s -> 5374.08s]  She's surrounded by all of this larger than life stuff
[5374.08s -> 5376.56s]  and she has to step up to it.
[5376.56s -> 5380.88s]  I feel like Thor got really interesting in the last like 10 or 15 years from for me.
[5380.88s -> 5384.88s]  I like where he's kind of landed in the public eye you know.
[5384.88s -> 5389.36s]  One of the things I think is cool about Cap is I never feel like he uh
[5389.36s -> 5391.76s]  he necessarily wants to be a leader.
[5391.76s -> 5392.96s]  He accepts that he is.
[5392.96s -> 5395.92s]  I feel like sometimes the best leaders are the ones who don't necessarily want to be
[5395.92s -> 5397.60s]  but they're right for the job.
[5397.60s -> 5399.44s]  Having an original story to tell as well
[5400.56s -> 5402.72s]  what they've done at Crystal Dynamics is great so
[5402.72s -> 5404.88s]  I think everybody's gonna be pretty stoked.
[5404.88s -> 5407.52s]  The Avengers are at their best when they are all together
[5407.52s -> 5411.28s]  but the chemistry is do not shake.
[5413.60s -> 5415.20s]  Thanks everybody for joining us.
[5415.20s -> 5416.80s]  Can't wait for you to be able to play the game
[5416.80s -> 5420.40s]  but right now you don't have to wait for some exclusive content.
[5421.12s -> 5421.92s]  By the way it's me.
[5421.92s -> 5423.76s]  I sound like exactly the guy on the other side
[5423.76s -> 5425.36s]  but it's not him it's me talking now.
[5426.24s -> 5427.92s]  When he talks it sounds like me talking.
[5427.92s -> 5430.40s]  Do the Avengers pose a danger to society?
[5430.40s -> 5431.60s]  That was the question Bruce.
[5432.40s -> 5433.44s]  That was the question.
[5434.00s -> 5435.76s]  Did you even check the science?
[5437.52s -> 5439.04s]  It was a heist Bruce.
[5439.04s -> 5439.28s]  No.
[5439.28s -> 5440.40s]  We were outsmarted.
[5440.40s -> 5444.72s]  The Terrigen reactor was unstable and you knew that you knew that
[5444.72s -> 5447.44s]  and you still paraded it before the entire world.
[5447.44s -> 5448.08s]  So what?
[5448.08s -> 5448.96s]  We just give up.
[5448.96s -> 5451.20s]  We didn't give up Tony.
[5451.20s -> 5452.48s]  We failed.
[5453.28s -> 5454.72s]  At least I can admit that.
[5458.28s -> 5459.96s]  We failed him.
[5459.96s -> 5462.33s]  We failed him.
[5462.97s -> 5466.86s]  Who's him?
[5466.86s -> 5472.06s]  Please welcome Scott Amis, head of studio and Megan Marie,
[5472.06s -> 5475.82s]  senior community and social media manager Crystal Dynamics.
[5477.02s -> 5486.76s]  This game might be pretty good.
[5486.76s -> 5487.72s]  Hello E3.
[5493.66s -> 5497.02s]  You've just seen a high level view of the cinematic
[5497.02s -> 5500.14s]  and character-driven campaign of Marvel's Avengers
[5500.70s -> 5504.22s]  but launch is only the beginning of this adventure.
[5505.02s -> 5508.62s]  Marvel's Avengers delivers a narrative over multiple years
[5508.62s -> 5511.58s]  with exciting new content released at a regular basis.
[5513.02s -> 5516.62s]  Like the Avengers, you and your friends are stronger together.
[5517.50s -> 5521.34s]  You'll assemble into teams of up to four players online
[5522.30s -> 5526.68s]  where you can master extraordinary abilities,
[5527.32s -> 5531.00s]  where you can customize a growing roster of heroes
[5531.00s -> 5533.56s]  and defend the earth from ever-escalating threats.
[5534.52s -> 5535.32s]  Oh, yes.
[5535.32s -> 5536.28s]  Oh, yes.
[5537.32s -> 5540.76s]  And to make sure everyone on this journey with us,
[5540.76s -> 5542.84s]  we're incredibly thrilled to announce
[5542.84s -> 5546.52s]  that every new superhero and every new region
[5546.52s -> 5548.68s]  will be delivered at no additional cost.
[5549.80s -> 5560.28s]  Our promise to the community
[5560.28s -> 5562.52s]  is that we won't have random loot boxes
[5562.52s -> 5563.96s]  or pay-to-win scenarios.
[5565.32s -> 5569.31s]  I love how that's such a selling point now.
[5569.87s -> 5571.55s]  This game represents a collaboration across Crystal Dynamics.
[5571.55s -> 5573.87s]  It's like going to the fucking dentist.
[5574.03s -> 5575.31s]  And he's like, let me tell you something.
[5575.31s -> 5577.63s]  I promise not to use the drill on your eye.
[5579.10s -> 5579.66s]  Oh, thanks.
[5579.66s -> 5580.38s]  I love Montreal.
[5580.38s -> 5581.10s]  These guys are here.
[5582.73s -> 5587.47s]  Nixie Software, our new Crystal Northwest studio
[5588.81s -> 5590.65s]  and everyone at Square Enix.
[5595.96s -> 5598.52s]  So our game is about embracing your powers
[5598.52s -> 5600.44s]  and living your superhero dreams.
[5600.44s -> 5602.60s]  It's bad when the other dentists do that.
[5602.60s -> 5603.56s]  We have an exclusive game play demo in our booth
[5603.56s -> 5606.44s]  that will show you more of the core campaign.
[5606.44s -> 5608.04s]  It's original story.
[5608.04s -> 5609.80s]  This would be $5 per stamp.
[5614.56s -> 5617.12s]  So Marvel's Avengers will release worldwide
[5617.84s -> 5623.12s]  on PS4, Xbox One, Stadia, and PC.
[5623.12s -> 5623.62s]  When?
[5624.16s -> 5626.67s]  We got you covered.
[5627.87s -> 5630.67s]  And we're excited to be partnering with PlayStation
[5630.67s -> 5633.07s]  to bring some awesome surprises
[5633.07s -> 5634.27s]  to the PlayStation audience.
[5635.98s -> 5638.06s]  Google may as well just pull the fucking zipper
[5638.06s -> 5639.18s]  off the top of the ceiling
[5639.18s -> 5640.14s]  and drop the fucking money.
[5641.85s -> 5642.57s]  They want it.
[5642.57s -> 5644.01s]  They want you on there.
[5644.01s -> 5645.29s]  That will be revealing in the future.
[5645.29s -> 5647.45s]  Just sprinkle it across the whole crowd.
[5648.78s -> 5649.74s]  But before we go,
[5650.70s -> 5653.02s]  we have one final glimpse into our world,
[5653.90s -> 5656.54s]  including when you'll get to play this game.
[5659.10s -> 5662.06s]  This is what's next for the Avengers.
[5662.06s -> 5663.26s]  Thank you, true believers.
[5664.06s -> 5666.40s]  We're going to release date?
[5669.69s -> 5670.19s]  Damn it.
[5671.05s -> 5674.96s]  I have a plan, but it's risky.
[5676.48s -> 5678.32s]  Hank, that doesn't look ready.
[5678.32s -> 5679.68s]  Come on, Tony, live a little.
[5681.36s -> 5689.55s]  Unbelievable.
[5690.19s -> 5690.69s]  It worked.
[5692.68s -> 5693.18s]  Hank?
[5693.80s -> 5696.68s]  It's sort of cute when they're small.
[5697.90s -> 5699.90s]  Ah, I didn't doubt you for a second, Hank.
[5701.66s -> 5714.65s]  Release date, come on.
[5716.80s -> 5718.08s]  Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes.
[5747.66s -> 5750.06s]  Whoa, whoa, I don't agree to any of that shit.
[5750.06s -> 5750.94s]  I don't agree to that.
[5751.58s -> 5753.71s]  I didn't agree to this.
[5754.35s -> 5766.41s]  Hey, thanks for watching the show.
[5766.41s -> 5768.41s]  All right, I'll tell you, I'll tell you one thing.
[5769.60s -> 5774.59s]  I, Final Fantasy VII was kind of cool.
[5775.72s -> 5777.00s]  I'm really not interested in, like,
[5777.00s -> 5778.76s]  anything else that was shown today or here.
[5779.32s -> 5785.21s]  Final Fantasy VII looks pretty good.
[5785.21s -> 5787.69s]  I'm not really into really any of the other stuff.
[5787.69s -> 5796.52s]  The Dragon Quest building game looked kind of fun.
[5796.52s -> 5798.20s]  May 15th, you idiot.
[5800.56s -> 5809.08s]  Respect the streamer!
[5809.08s -> 5814.12s]  So, uh, play the first one.
[5814.68s -> 5816.68s]  I really am, like, in a dark corner, huh?
[5820.51s -> 5823.15s]  E3 was pretty, pretty bad this year.
[5823.15s -> 5830.75s]  Am I going to do Nintendo tomorrow?
[5830.75s -> 5832.35s]  I don't know, I don't think so.
[5832.35s -> 5835.87s]  Because, let me, let's get like a,
[5835.87s -> 5837.23s]  it really is dark in here.
[5837.23s -> 5842.94s]  Let's, let's figure out what's going to happen.
[5842.94s -> 5844.70s]  I don't think I'm going to do Nintendo tomorrow.
[5845.34s -> 5850.65s]  Because Nintendo really is only like,
[5850.65s -> 5852.01s]  what, like 45 minutes?
[5852.57s -> 5854.01s]  It's an edited thing.
[5854.01s -> 5854.89s]  I'm not sure I'm going to do it.
[5855.45s -> 5856.25s]  I didn't do Devolver.
[5856.25s -> 5857.37s]  I kind of, I'd rather just watch, like,
[5857.37s -> 5859.45s]  the 40 to 50 minute presentation, whatever it is.
[5862.96s -> 5864.08s]  It's just for, like, Smash.
[5864.08s -> 5865.28s]  It's probably going to be Smash and
[5868.04s -> 5870.20s]  shows up for Bethesda and Square and Ubi,
[5870.20s -> 5871.80s]  but won't do Nintendo.
[5871.80s -> 5877.10s]  Oh, this is about to, like, turn off.
[5886.35s -> 5889.87s]  Show it up for AMD, but won't show up for Nintendo.
[5891.95s -> 5893.87s]  Yeah, but come on.
[5901.02s -> 5902.78s]  I didn't do Nintendo last year.
[5902.78s -> 5904.06s]  Did I do Nintendo last year?
[5904.62s -> 5905.10s]  I didn't.
[5911.80s -> 5913.08s]  I did Nintendo last year.
[5914.59s -> 5915.07s]  All right.
[5915.07s -> 5915.47s]  All right.
[5915.47s -> 5916.11s]  I'll do Nintendo.
[5916.11s -> 5916.83s]  We'll do, all right.
[5916.83s -> 5917.63s]  I'll do Nintendo.
[5917.63s -> 5918.59s]  I'm going to do Nintendo.
[5919.15s -> 5919.55s]  You're here?
[5919.55s -> 5920.83s]  I just confirmed it.
[5920.83s -> 5922.19s]  It didn't last, all right.
[5922.19s -> 5923.87s]  I'll do, all right, all right, all right.
[5923.87s -> 5927.12s]  Tomorrow, tomorrow is going to be a quick one though.
[5927.12s -> 5927.92s]  Tomorrow I'm going to do,
[5927.92s -> 5931.29s]  it's going to be a short stream tomorrow.
[5931.29s -> 5932.41s]  It's at 9 a.m.?
[5935.26s -> 5936.70s]  Oh, fuck no.
[5936.70s -> 5938.06s]  It's at 9 a.m. Pacific?
[5938.06s -> 5938.70s]  No, it's not.
[5943.61s -> 5944.89s]  I ain't waking up for that one.
[5944.89s -> 5945.37s]  I'll try.
[5946.01s -> 5950.59s]  I'm going to, I'm going to, okay.
[5950.59s -> 5951.39s]  I'm going to, I'll tell you,
[5951.39s -> 5952.27s]  I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
[5955.40s -> 5957.24s]  I will tear myself out of bed.
[5958.04s -> 5959.80s]  I will, I will rip myself out of bed
[5959.80s -> 5961.72s]  and like fucking get over here in a bathrobe
[5961.72s -> 5964.64s]  and stream for an hour.
[5964.64s -> 5965.20s]  That's the plan.
[5965.20s -> 5965.76s]  That's what I'm doing.
[5968.30s -> 5969.58s]  You can't get up by 9.
[5972.11s -> 5974.83s]  No, it's not that I can't get up by 9.
[5974.83s -> 5978.03s]  It's that when your body is so used to waking up
[5978.03s -> 5981.07s]  at like fucking 11, 12, 1 p.m.
[5981.07s -> 5981.79s]  I wake up late.
[5981.79s -> 5982.67s]  I go to bed late.
[5984.86s -> 5985.98s]  It's hard to get up at like 8.
[5985.98s -> 5987.90s]  I don't, I'm not waking up at 9.
[5987.90s -> 5989.74s]  I'd have to get up at like 7.30.
[5989.74s -> 5991.18s]  I got to go to the bathroom.
[5991.18s -> 5992.14s]  I've got to eat food.
[5992.14s -> 5993.02s]  I've got to shower.
[5993.66s -> 5994.86s]  It takes like an hour and a half.
[5995.74s -> 5996.86s]  I'm going to wake up at like 6.
[6000.00s -> 6001.76s]  The big boy sleeps late.
[6005.96s -> 6006.52s]  No, we'll do it.
[6006.52s -> 6007.08s]  I'll get up.
[6007.08s -> 6007.40s]  I'll do it.
[6007.40s -> 6008.36s]  I'm going to look like shit.
[6008.36s -> 6009.40s]  I'm not going to be like fucking,
[6010.36s -> 6011.16s]  I'm going to look terrible.
[6011.16s -> 6012.20s]  I'm going to be unshowered.
[6013.13s -> 6014.57s]  I'm going to be unshowered, unshit,
[6015.13s -> 6016.25s]  and like unshaved.
[6019.48s -> 6020.76s]  So I hope you're ready for that stream.
[6020.76s -> 6021.80s]  By the way, that stream is going to be
[6021.80s -> 6023.40s]  literally fucking an hour and 30 minutes.
[6024.60s -> 6026.78s]  We ain't doing a long one tomorrow.
[6026.78s -> 6028.06s]  I'm going to just go back to bed.
[6031.05s -> 6032.65s]  I'm going to watch the Nintendo conference,
[6032.65s -> 6035.21s]  give you my like terrible dog shit takes,
[6035.21s -> 6036.25s]  and then I'm going to go to bed.
[6038.49s -> 6039.29s]  No makeup.
[6039.29s -> 6040.97s]  Yeah, no makeup involved tomorrow.
[6046.52s -> 6047.56s]  Lazy boy.
[6051.45s -> 6054.73s]  Guys, do you understand how bad my takes are
[6054.73s -> 6055.29s]  for these things?
[6056.01s -> 6058.56s]  Persona 5, not even like a mainstream game.
[6058.56s -> 6060.48s]  It only sold like millions of copies.
[6061.28s -> 6063.76s]  But Final Fantasy VII, who's that character?
[6063.76s -> 6064.26s]  Axel?
[6064.88s -> 6065.68s]  I don't know shit.
[6066.48s -> 6069.02s]  I know two things.
[6071.52s -> 6072.64s]  How to remove a wart.
[6073.28s -> 6076.60s]  You put, I know how to remove a wart.
[6077.87s -> 6080.24s]  And the best way to clean the toilet.
[6080.24s -> 6082.32s]  I don't know anything else.
[6082.32s -> 6083.44s]  I know about conflict.
[6085.32s -> 6085.88s]  You freeze it.
[6085.88s -> 6086.76s]  You get a little freeze thing.
[6086.76s -> 6089.42s]  You're like, I just did it like a week ago.
[6089.42s -> 6090.14s]  I had like 12.
[6090.14s -> 6092.06s]  I had like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[6092.06s -> 6092.62s]  They were all over me.
[6094.30s -> 6097.02s]  I keep like breathing in frogs and I can't stop.
[6099.98s -> 6101.26s]  They're all over my hands.
[6101.26s -> 6102.62s]  I have like 25 frog pets.
[6102.62s -> 6103.10s]  They're the best.
[6103.74s -> 6112.32s]  How do you clean a toilet?
[6112.88s -> 6115.34s]  Wouldn't you like to know?
[6115.90s -> 6119.34s]  What's your secret to removing warts?
[6119.34s -> 6122.67s]  You have to get the witch to come over
[6122.67s -> 6123.79s]  and fucking de-curse you.
[6126.06s -> 6127.50s]  You lick the bowl.
[6128.14s -> 6129.34s]  You guys are fucked.
[6137.02s -> 6138.30s]  Hey, skip this guy talk.
[6138.30s -> 6139.42s]  Where's the next trailer?
[6139.42s -> 6140.70s]  Where's the next E3 trailer?
[6140.70s -> 6141.50s]  This guy sucks.
[6144.16s -> 6146.94s]  All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[6146.94s -> 6147.82s]  I'm going to wake up.
[6147.82s -> 6148.78s]  I'm going to get up and I'm going to,
[6148.78s -> 6149.58s]  it's going to be painful.
[6150.38s -> 6151.98s]  I'm going to, you're going to see me
[6151.98s -> 6153.10s]  at my absolute worst.
[6153.82s -> 6154.32s]  Okay?
[6155.82s -> 6156.62s]  When I'm going to turn,
[6156.62s -> 6157.98s]  I'm going to rip myself out of bed
[6157.98s -> 6160.36s]  and I'm going to press the stream button.
[6160.36s -> 6161.72s]  You, it's going to be me
[6161.72s -> 6164.84s]  at the very, very base level of person.
[6164.84s -> 6165.80s]  Like it's just going to be me.
[6171.21s -> 6172.49s]  I forgot about five nights at Freddy's.
[6173.37s -> 6174.49s]  Well, that person just removed
[6174.49s -> 6175.77s]  a minute from the broadcast.
[6175.77s -> 6176.49s]  So that's it.
[6177.13s -> 6178.57s]  I was going to give 60 more seconds,
[6178.57s -> 6183.90s]  but you know, let's back it out here.
[6183.90s -> 6184.46s]  Thanks for watching.
[6184.46s -> 6185.42s]  Hope you enjoyed E3.
[6187.71s -> 6188.83s]  See you tomorrow for Nintendo.
[6191.48s -> 6192.76s]  Hopefully you're excited about some stuff.
[6195.42s -> 6196.30s]  Some of that look pretty good.
[6197.55s -> 6199.07s]  I actually really think Watch Dogs 3
[6199.07s -> 6201.64s]  might be fun or Watch Dogs Legion.
[6201.64s -> 6205.08s]  Sorry, at least for a while.
[6205.08s -> 6215.80s]  Let me go like this,
[6216.94s -> 6218.78s]  but we'll do the bits and the subs.
[6218.78s -> 6219.42s]  Thanks everybody.
[6220.41s -> 6222.09s]  See you bright and early tomorrow
[6222.09s -> 6226.04s]  if you get up for it at what?
[6226.04s -> 6230.24s]  Something like eight or nine AM Pacific?
[6230.24s -> 6231.20s]  Whatever it is.
[6231.20s -> 6232.16s]  The suss will be correct.
[6234.80s -> 6237.08s]  I will see you all tomorrow.
[6237.08s -> 6237.96s]  I'm going to oversleep.
[6238.52s -> 6239.00s]  No, I'm not.
[6240.36s -> 6242.12s]  If I confirmed it, it's happening.
[6242.12s -> 6249.96s]  I hope you had a good time.
[6249.96s -> 6252.27s]  It's always fun to hang out
[6252.27s -> 6254.92s]  and stick around with the chat for a while.
[6257.55s -> 6258.43s]  So what do you say?
[6258.43s -> 6261.63s]  We do the bits from earlier this afternoon.
[6268.25s -> 6270.01s]  So from earlier we had
[6272.65s -> 6275.45s]  we had $2.50 from Dorkcube.
[6275.45s -> 6276.17s]  Thank you Dorkcube.
[6276.81s -> 6280.59s]  I hate Jerm.
[6281.79s -> 6284.35s]  Liu Da Wang did a stream yesterday
[6284.35s -> 6285.31s]  where she made probably
[6285.31s -> 6287.31s]  the most accurate depictions of you.
[6288.03s -> 6290.19s]  She may have also given you
[6290.19s -> 6291.71s]  a sans undertale eye.
[6303.82s -> 6305.26s]  I have so many monitors.
[6312.75s -> 6314.51s]  One of my monitors is a triangle.
[6314.51s -> 6315.55s]  That's fucking hilarious.
[6316.65s -> 6319.61s]  Chatter 7369, 69,000 bits.
[6319.61s -> 6321.05s]  Ah, funny meme reference.
[6321.77s -> 6322.99s]  He doesn't know.
[6322.99s -> 6323.39s]  LOL.
[6323.39s -> 6324.27s]  What is a meme?
[6324.27s -> 6325.15s]  I do this all the time.
[6325.71s -> 6330.67s]  I'll put it on the screen.
[6334.25s -> 6335.05s]  Every time we have a stream
[6335.05s -> 6335.85s]  I have to go back and like
[6336.65s -> 6338.17s]  fact check my memes.
[6339.26s -> 6340.54s]  I can't believe that that's a real thing
[6340.54s -> 6341.10s]  that I have to do.
[6353.55s -> 6354.19s]  That's not it.
[6354.75s -> 6365.10s]  What are some of these pictures?
[6369.87s -> 6370.35s]  There it is.
[6371.07s -> 6380.59s]  Two o'clock and you get the
[6380.59s -> 6381.39s]  two o'clock in the morning.
[6381.39s -> 6382.19s]  That's perfect.
[6383.07s -> 6383.87s]  Sometimes later.
[6390.89s -> 6391.53s]  Is that Kim?
[6393.93s -> 6394.41s]  Wait, why?
[6397.32s -> 6398.52s]  There's like a spilt shit
[6398.52s -> 6399.16s]  all over the place.
[6400.73s -> 6401.61s]  I'm in A's.
[6403.28s -> 6404.48s]  Why is she on the floor?
[6406.32s -> 6406.96s]  Thank you for this.
[6406.96s -> 6407.84s]  This is fucking awesome.
[6416.59s -> 6417.39s]  That's good shit.
[6417.39s -> 6417.71s]  Thank you.
[6418.27s -> 6421.50s]  And thank you door cue for the 250.
[6423.96s -> 6425.48s]  Hey mouse, thanks for 250.
[6426.04s -> 6427.24s]  We can achieve the goal of having
[6427.24s -> 6429.88s]  an only elderly hacktivist organization.
[6430.52s -> 6433.28s]  I'll try it.
[6433.28s -> 6434.00s]  When that comes out
[6434.00s -> 6435.28s]  I'm only going to do old people.
[6438.67s -> 6440.27s]  My whole gang is going to be
[6440.27s -> 6441.23s]  all elderly.
[6442.49s -> 6443.05s]  We can try.
[6445.92s -> 6448.24s]  Thank you SGH for the 15 dollars.
[6448.24s -> 6449.12s]  Love you Jerma.
[6449.12s -> 6450.08s]  Just finished cracking up
[6450.08s -> 6451.12s]  with your last upload.
[6451.12s -> 6451.60s]  Never change.
[6453.28s -> 6454.40s]  Thanks for the 15 dollars.
[6456.38s -> 6458.06s]  I don't have any capability to.
[6462.43s -> 6464.03s]  So I can't change.
[6464.83s -> 6465.47s]  It's too late.
[6466.11s -> 6467.96s]  So thank you.
[6467.96s -> 6468.76s]  I really appreciate it.
[6469.40s -> 6471.08s]  Thank you for the 15 dollars.
[6471.80s -> 6474.99s]  Jerma lied about Taco Bell
[6474.99s -> 6475.87s]  thanks to the 250.
[6478.04s -> 6479.56s]  Devs keep putting celebrities
[6479.56s -> 6480.76s]  into single player storylines
[6480.76s -> 6482.36s]  for like five minutes to drum a pipe.
[6482.92s -> 6484.84s]  For five out of ten cod rip-offs.
[6489.32s -> 6489.96s]  What?
[6489.96s -> 6494.04s]  Oh, thought too much conflict.
[6495.34s -> 6495.74s]  You know what?
[6495.74s -> 6496.70s]  I am really excited
[6496.70s -> 6498.14s]  for tomorrow's Nintendo stream.
[6498.70s -> 6499.26s]  You know why?
[6500.51s -> 6501.47s]  There's not going to be a whole lot
[6501.47s -> 6503.39s]  of constant conflict on that stream.
[6506.70s -> 6507.02s]  Wow.
[6508.60s -> 6510.28s]  Nintendo may win the conference
[6511.95s -> 6513.15s]  just because of that one reason.
[6513.71s -> 6517.82s]  That depends on what they show.
[6518.62s -> 6524.56s]  Smash Brothers is all constant,
[6524.56s -> 6525.36s]  is all conflict.
[6526.25s -> 6527.05s]  Uh oh, you're right.
[6528.27s -> 6528.75s]  Don't worry.
[6528.75s -> 6529.23s]  Don't worry guys.
[6529.23s -> 6530.51s]  Guys like Toad's going to solve
[6530.51s -> 6532.19s]  a couple of puzzles in his new game.
[6532.19s -> 6533.87s]  So that'll balance it out a little.
[6540.65s -> 6541.61s]  Hey, thank you to
[6542.41s -> 6543.85s]  Demonic Cucumber for the three bucks.
[6543.85s -> 6544.49s]  The purple light
[6544.49s -> 6545.61s]  and the slick back villain hair
[6545.61s -> 6547.21s]  makes Jerma look like Mega Mind.
[6549.08s -> 6549.96s]  Thanks for the compliment.
[6550.52s -> 6553.85s]  It means I'm pretty smart.
[6565.12s -> 6565.68s]  But thank you.
[6568.49s -> 6570.17s]  Thank you also to, uh,
[6571.53s -> 6572.81s]  Kyari, Ky-
[6572.81s -> 6574.57s]  Kyari 5.
[6574.57s -> 6575.77s]  No, Kyari, Ky-
[6577.42s -> 6580.14s]  Kyari 13 for the five dollars.
[6580.14s -> 6580.54s]  There you go.
[6582.86s -> 6589.08s]  Uh, for the Gungeon Cab Fund cabinet.
[6589.64s -> 6591.26s]  What would you guys do
[6591.26s -> 6591.98s]  if you seriously,
[6591.98s -> 6592.94s]  if the stream turned on
[6593.74s -> 6594.70s]  and right behind me,
[6594.70s -> 6595.82s]  I turned the webcam on
[6595.82s -> 6596.86s]  and the Enter the Gungeon
[6596.86s -> 6598.46s]  five thousand dollar cabinet was behind me.
[6605.42s -> 6607.66s]  I would post the PogChamp emote in the chat.
[6608.22s -> 6613.24s]  But then what would I do with it?
[6613.24s -> 6614.52s]  You know how much of a pain in the ass
[6614.52s -> 6615.96s]  it was to get that TV out of my room?
[6617.85s -> 6618.97s]  It was so difficult
[6618.97s -> 6621.77s]  and so hard to get that television
[6621.77s -> 6622.57s]  into that room
[6622.57s -> 6623.45s]  and out of that room.
[6631.48s -> 6633.56s]  Me and Kim brought that big
[6633.56s -> 6635.48s]  300 pound TV down the stairs.
[6636.80s -> 6638.24s]  We almost like died.
[6639.31s -> 6640.59s]  The two of us were just like,
[6640.59s -> 6641.55s]  no, no, no, no, just look out,
[6641.55s -> 6642.67s]  wait, wait, wait, I gotta put it down,
[6642.67s -> 6643.95s]  put it down, put it down.
[6643.95s -> 6658.54s]  I think I threw my back out during that
[6658.54s -> 6659.50s]  and it's never healed.
[6660.22s -> 6663.40s]  When we were bringing that
[6663.40s -> 6664.76s]  down the stairs into that room,
[6665.32s -> 6667.00s]  I think I have never recovered
[6667.00s -> 6668.44s]  from like hurting my back
[6668.44s -> 6669.48s]  like a year ago.
[6670.20s -> 6673.24s]  It's because Kim did all the work.
[6673.24s -> 6674.36s]  No, I didn't do the thing.
[6675.00s -> 6675.80s]  Look, I know everybody
[6675.80s -> 6676.68s]  thinks I did the thing
[6677.40s -> 6679.80s]  where like here, oh my God.
[6680.60s -> 6681.08s]  You all right?
[6681.88s -> 6685.48s]  Yeah, I'll think I did the thing
[6685.48s -> 6687.96s]  where here's a big heavy item, right?
[6687.96s -> 6689.88s]  One person's here, one person's here
[6689.88s -> 6691.56s]  and maybe three of you lifted it.
[6691.56s -> 6692.76s]  And you do the like
[6693.32s -> 6694.68s]  we're over at a sleepover
[6694.68s -> 6695.80s]  doing light as a feather,
[6695.80s -> 6696.52s]  as stiff as a board
[6696.52s -> 6697.64s]  and I'm just like pretending
[6697.64s -> 6699.08s]  like I'm putting pressure here.
[6699.08s -> 6700.36s]  But really I'm just making you
[6700.36s -> 6701.64s]  you two do all the work
[6701.64s -> 6703.00s]  while I go like this
[6703.00s -> 6704.28s]  and just like pretend to lift it up.
[6705.56s -> 6706.76s]  I know that you thought that
[6706.76s -> 6707.40s]  that's what I was doing
[6707.40s -> 6708.44s]  but that's not possible.
[6709.24s -> 6710.20s]  That's not possible
[6710.20s -> 6711.80s]  in a two-person scenario.
[6711.80s -> 6713.48s]  In a three-person, four-person scenario,
[6713.48s -> 6714.92s]  yes, I do that all the time.
[6715.48s -> 6717.32s]  And I'm not a strong person.
[6717.88s -> 6719.64s]  I just like to people
[6719.64s -> 6720.52s]  to think that I'm helping.
[6721.72s -> 6726.57s]  Why is this so heavy?
[6726.57s -> 6727.53s]  What the fuck's happening?
[6727.53s -> 6729.80s]  I know this thing's really heavy.
[6729.80s -> 6730.60s]  Yeah, this is heavy.
[6731.40s -> 6732.44s]  Fuck, it's like hurt my arm.
[6733.24s -> 6735.00s]  You guys good?
[6739.56s -> 6740.60s]  I don't do that.
[6740.60s -> 6741.24s]  It's a joke.
[6741.96s -> 6749.36s]  You thought I was Jack?
[6749.36s -> 6750.80s]  No, I just it's air.
[6750.80s -> 6752.00s]  I was inflated.
[6752.56s -> 6757.20s]  I was wearing one of those
[6757.20s -> 6758.96s]  cheap, goofy, inflated suits.
[6765.24s -> 6766.04s]  Spongebob.
[6766.04s -> 6767.08s]  Yeah, Spongebob arms.
[6769.84s -> 6770.24s]  Anyways.
[6771.66s -> 6772.70s]  Thank you to Germalight
[6772.70s -> 6774.54s]  about Taco Bell for the two dollars and fifty cents.
[6775.42s -> 6776.46s]  You can't rob a bank
[6778.08s -> 6779.28s]  live stream the robbery
[6779.28s -> 6780.32s]  and expect to get away with it.
[6782.54s -> 6783.82s]  No, that's why I know.
[6784.70s -> 6785.50s]  That's not going to happen.
[6794.04s -> 6795.64s]  Why is Slow Mode still on?
[6795.64s -> 6797.40s]  Because there were a lot of people here today
[6797.40s -> 6798.20s]  and yesterday too.
[6798.92s -> 6801.36s]  So Slow Mode was on
[6802.00s -> 6803.28s]  pretty much the whole time, yeah.
[6804.16s -> 6808.25s]  How did I react to Destroy All Humans?
[6809.28s -> 6812.08s]  It looks, from what you can see, looks good.
[6812.08s -> 6813.52s]  I didn't, I saw the trailer
[6814.24s -> 6815.92s]  where they, everyone gets hypnotized.
[6817.60s -> 6822.91s]  E3, E3 attracts a lot of people.
[6822.91s -> 6824.51s]  I hope they had fun here.
[6826.51s -> 6828.40s]  Sometimes, yeah, you look over and you
[6829.52s -> 6830.48s]  say, holy shit, wait,
[6830.48s -> 6832.08s]  there's like 8,000 people here.
[6832.88s -> 6837.05s]  Like, hopefully they liked it.
[6841.60s -> 6843.76s]  Hey, thank you Rad Sully for the five dollars.
[6844.48s -> 6848.16s]  All this E3 talk is getting me
[6849.12s -> 6851.04s]  hot for the epic Jerma Khan.
[6851.04s -> 6851.54s]  When is it?
[6852.48s -> 6855.71s]  The epic Jerma Khan.
[6857.02s -> 6858.22s]  I forgot about that.
[6861.42s -> 6864.62s]  Maybe, soon, possibly, in the future,
[6864.62s -> 6866.14s]  you will see a get-together.
[6866.14s -> 6867.34s]  Possible, it might happen.
[6868.06s -> 6868.94s]  Don't quote me on that.
[6868.94s -> 6869.82s]  Don't hold me to that.
[6873.42s -> 6874.14s]  I know what it is.
[6874.14s -> 6875.58s]  I wasn't like trashed.
[6877.39s -> 6879.15s]  Hey, thanks Mr. Comcast for the three dollars.
[6879.15s -> 6880.35s]  Hey Jerma, John Comcast here.
[6880.35s -> 6881.31s]  Just letting you know that I'm sitting
[6881.31s -> 6882.67s]  in the audience at E3
[6882.67s -> 6884.19s]  and I found it weird when you showed up
[6884.19s -> 6886.19s]  on stage completely naked and drunk.
[6886.27s -> 6888.03s]  I found it very disrespectful
[6888.03s -> 6890.67s]  when you DDT'd the other host into the audience
[6890.67s -> 6893.79s]  while shouting about how tight your ass is
[6893.79s -> 6894.91s]  when you flex it.
[6894.91s -> 6896.03s]  I found it weird when you started
[6896.03s -> 6897.39s]  to push your way through the audience
[6898.35s -> 6899.31s]  taking their wallets.
[6900.11s -> 6901.15s]  The police showed up but you managed
[6901.15s -> 6901.95s]  to sneak out the back door
[6901.95s -> 6903.55s]  while holding a box of AMDs.
[6907.56s -> 6909.24s]  A box of AMDs.
[6910.99s -> 6914.64s]  Just the letters, not the graphics cards.
[6915.20s -> 6918.28s]  Well, I thought they were valuable.
[6924.62s -> 6926.86s]  Thank you Mr. Comcast for the three bucks.
[6926.86s -> 6928.70s]  Thank you Demonic Cucumber for the two fifty.
[6930.12s -> 6930.92s]  I don't think you thought
[6930.92s -> 6932.60s]  this MS-DOS game thing through.
[6932.60s -> 6934.12s]  You sorted it by best games
[6934.12s -> 6935.72s]  and are picking three
[6935.72s -> 6936.68s]  and then scrolling down.
[6936.68s -> 6937.80s]  Meaning that you're actively skipping
[6937.80s -> 6938.60s]  more than 70 percent
[6938.60s -> 6940.36s]  of the top-moded games on there.
[6940.36s -> 6941.64s]  Surely you should play more games
[6941.64s -> 6942.76s]  towards the top seeing as you're
[6942.76s -> 6943.96s]  sorted them by best games.
[6944.84s -> 6948.08s]  I can always go back.
[6950.65s -> 6951.45s]  There's so many.
[6952.09s -> 6953.05s]  And look, we don't have to play
[6953.05s -> 6956.04s]  the best games, you know?
[6956.04s -> 6958.52s]  When we sorted by not by popular,
[6959.61s -> 6960.97s]  we got some classics in there.
[6961.69s -> 6966.70s]  There's a lot.
[6966.70s -> 6968.14s]  Oh, there's forty-three hundred.
[6975.63s -> 6976.51s]  There's a lot to go through.
[6977.07s -> 6978.84s]  We got to see Pizza Worm.
[6978.84s -> 6983.32s]  It's pretty good.
[6983.88s -> 6985.18s]  Although Pizza Worm
[6985.18s -> 6986.38s]  may have been really popular.
[6991.47s -> 7004.96s]  Go back and do games that you missed.
[7004.96s -> 7005.60s]  I probably will.
[7006.96s -> 7008.08s]  It's just, it's hard to,
[7008.88s -> 7010.08s]  because there are so many of them.
[7011.80s -> 7012.92s]  It's almost like we just have
[7012.92s -> 7014.68s]  to throw darts for a while.
[7014.68s -> 7017.48s]  And then later when we go through
[7017.48s -> 7019.00s]  and get, I think there's like
[7019.00s -> 7021.80s]  an exhaustion period with that kind of site
[7022.99s -> 7024.67s]  where doing another three,
[7024.67s -> 7025.63s]  four, five, six times.
[7025.63s -> 7026.83s]  Maybe we will just go back
[7027.63s -> 7029.39s]  and pick out some of the classic ones
[7029.39s -> 7030.03s]  to just play.
[7030.99s -> 7033.28s]  But we're in dart phase right now.
[7037.24s -> 7038.65s]  But thank you.
[7041.16s -> 7042.20s]  Also, thank you, Mr.
[7042.20s -> 7043.56s]  Comcast again for the three dollars.
[7043.56s -> 7045.24s]  Hey, JermaJohnComcast here.
[7045.24s -> 7046.52s]  Just letting you know that I saw you
[7046.52s -> 7048.12s]  again after the E3 conference.
[7048.68s -> 7049.64s]  You were still naked,
[7049.64s -> 7051.00s]  but you had two AMD chips
[7051.00s -> 7052.04s]  glued to your nipples.
[7052.04s -> 7053.88s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[7053.88s -> 7055.40s]  You started yelling at passersby
[7055.40s -> 7057.72s]  about how your AMD stocks plummeted.
[7057.80s -> 7059.32s]  And that you were broke.
[7059.32s -> 7061.24s]  I found it weird when Keanu Reeves
[7061.24s -> 7062.12s]  showed up and you started
[7062.12s -> 7063.48s]  throwing swears at him.
[7063.48s -> 7064.92s]  Shouting that it should have been
[7065.64s -> 7067.40s]  your skin added to Fortnite.
[7067.40s -> 7068.28s]  The police showed up again
[7068.28s -> 7068.76s]  and they caught you
[7068.76s -> 7070.84s]  because you stopped to punch.
[7075.96s -> 7076.84s]  Thank you, Mr.
[7076.84s -> 7077.40s]  Comcast.
[7078.04s -> 7080.30s]  I really appreciate it.
[7080.30s -> 7082.14s]  Thanks for the funny little,
[7082.86s -> 7084.22s]  you know, laughing about it fiction.
[7088.40s -> 7089.84s]  Thank you, girl revolution
[7089.84s -> 7090.64s]  for the five dollars.
[7090.64s -> 7091.84s]  This is actually the very first
[7091.84s -> 7093.04s]  video game I ever played.
[7093.60s -> 7094.64s]  Thank you for reminding me.
[7095.12s -> 7097.18s]  I'm not sure what game that was.
[7097.90s -> 7100.78s]  Whatever game it happened to be.
[7101.50s -> 7103.15s]  I'm glad you got to see it.
[7105.69s -> 7106.25s]  Mini clips.
[7106.25s -> 7107.05s]  Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[7107.05s -> 7107.61s]  Mini clips.
[7109.26s -> 7110.62s]  The look of a mad man.
[7115.42s -> 7116.06s]  Me?
[7116.06s -> 7116.38s]  Yeah.
[7117.02s -> 7119.31s]  The mother goose one?
[7119.31s -> 7126.14s]  Oh, that one was cute.
[7126.14s -> 7127.02s]  I would have played that
[7127.02s -> 7128.06s]  for like 10 minutes.
[7128.94s -> 7132.38s]  But thank you.
[7132.38s -> 7133.50s]  Mini clips for the 10 bucks.
[7134.67s -> 7135.87s]  Oh, what?
[7135.87s -> 7136.19s]  What?
[7136.19s -> 7136.75s]  Freage.
[7136.75s -> 7138.59s]  Thanks for the 15 dollars.
[7138.59s -> 7139.63s]  Cheater streamer loses
[7139.63s -> 7140.83s]  Wheel of Fortune anyways.
[7141.63s -> 7144.11s]  Not very good at Wheel of Fortune.
[7146.51s -> 7147.63s]  I'm good at Family Feud.
[7151.20s -> 7152.24s]  That's the one I'm pretty good at.
[7154.68s -> 7155.16s]  Thank you.
[7155.16s -> 7156.60s]  Freudian weapon for the 250.
[7156.60s -> 7157.80s]  Lost to Fortune Wheel.
[7160.40s -> 7161.76s]  Literally, yes.
[7161.76s -> 7162.40s]  Literally.
[7163.12s -> 7163.36s]  Sure.
[7164.00s -> 7165.13s]  I'll let that one slide.
[7165.93s -> 7168.08s]  And we also had Flug Boy.
[7168.08s -> 7168.88s]  Two dollars and 50 cents.
[7168.88s -> 7169.84s]  A German full disclosure.
[7169.84s -> 7170.96s]  Dragon Quest 11 is probably
[7170.96s -> 7172.48s]  one of the best in the series.
[7173.12s -> 7176.56s]  I've been playing since DQ7, probably.
[7176.56s -> 7177.52s]  And I highly recommend it
[7177.52s -> 7178.64s]  if you're interested.
[7178.64s -> 7179.44s]  I would say it's definitely
[7179.44s -> 7181.36s]  an off-stream game though.
[7181.36s -> 7181.92s]  Much love.
[7186.09s -> 7189.02s]  Yeah, they look cool.
[7189.02s -> 7189.74s]  It looks fun.
[7189.74s -> 7190.54s]  It looks interesting.
[7191.34s -> 7198.78s]  I just never got into any of those
[7200.52s -> 7201.88s]  in the years that they've existed.
[7202.60s -> 7205.00s]  Do I play games off stream?
[7205.00s -> 7205.48s]  Sometimes.
[7206.20s -> 7207.16s]  I actually just downloaded
[7207.16s -> 7208.28s]  Slay the Spire for the Switch.
[7209.16s -> 7212.49s]  Just was hanging out
[7212.49s -> 7213.21s]  playing it the other day.
[7213.85s -> 7215.12s]  It's pretty fun.
[7215.92s -> 7223.50s]  Frank Leo Wright.
[7224.22s -> 7226.72s]  It's another one of those things
[7226.72s -> 7228.32s]  that I will just never live down
[7228.32s -> 7229.36s]  for the rest of my life.
[7230.08s -> 7235.18s]  It's like I have live
[7235.18s -> 7239.02s]  time-stamped clips of Leo.
[7240.06s -> 7241.26s]  What a pee pants moment.
[7241.82s -> 7244.41s]  It's all right.
[7245.13s -> 7248.48s]  At least it wasn't the slap.
[7248.48s -> 7249.44s]  That was by far the worst
[7249.44s -> 7250.48s]  thing I've ever done on camera.
[7251.12s -> 7253.10s]  Let me remind myself again
[7253.10s -> 7254.30s]  to keep myself grounded.
[7260.20s -> 7264.67s]  Jesus fucking God.
[7268.27s -> 7269.39s]  Nobody can do this.
[7270.75s -> 7272.27s]  I saw a comment of somebody saying
[7272.27s -> 7273.79s]  that this is not possible.
[7273.79s -> 7274.67s]  It has to be fake.
[7275.84s -> 7277.12s]  I agree with that person.
[7278.54s -> 7281.18s]  It's not possible to do what I did.
[7281.18s -> 7281.98s]  It's impossible.
[7282.62s -> 7291.39s]  Little do they know.
[7294.35s -> 7295.39s]  Yeah, I saw that comment.
[7295.39s -> 7296.51s]  I'm just like, fuck.
[7296.51s -> 7297.95s]  It's I know.
[7297.95s -> 7298.67s]  I know.
[7299.55s -> 7302.14s]  I want to like come in there
[7302.14s -> 7303.02s]  and be like, I know.
[7303.58s -> 7303.90s]  I know.
[7304.70s -> 7305.42s]  I trust me.
[7305.42s -> 7306.94s]  I know better than anybody.
[7312.83s -> 7313.63s]  Hey, Tora T.
[7313.63s -> 7314.35s]  Thanks for the $15.
[7315.23s -> 7316.70s]  Jeremy, you better do it.
[7316.70s -> 7317.66s]  Don't lie to us.
[7318.38s -> 7319.82s]  I'm gonna do the Nintendo conference.
[7320.62s -> 7322.43s]  We also had Hack It Fast.
[7322.43s -> 7323.31s]  Had five community subs.
[7323.31s -> 7324.19s]  Thank you, Hack It Fast.
[7327.95s -> 7329.15s]  Some more community subs come in.
[7329.71s -> 7333.37s]  We had Hack It Fast gave five.
[7333.37s -> 7335.13s]  Bala Koala gave some too.
[7335.13s -> 7337.13s]  Thank you guys for your community subs.
[7337.85s -> 7339.68s]  And thank you Tora T for the $15.
[7340.40s -> 7344.94s]  That was your first ever stream of me
[7344.94s -> 7346.54s]  and I slapped myself
[7346.54s -> 7347.34s]  within the first 10 minutes
[7347.34s -> 7347.98s]  of you watching it.
[7351.69s -> 7352.49s]  Welcome to the channel.
[7357.85s -> 7358.65s]  Hey, you still here?
[7361.21s -> 7361.85s]  How do you do?
[7362.41s -> 7363.05s]  Good to see you.
[7363.69s -> 7365.40s]  That's how you reel them in.
[7366.20s -> 7366.84s]  Oh God.
[7367.80s -> 7368.52s]  Dabs for dinner.
[7368.52s -> 7369.32s]  Thanks for the $2.50.
[7369.32s -> 7370.68s]  You showed up for the Nintendo showcase
[7370.68s -> 7371.80s]  in a bathrobe last year.
[7372.44s -> 7373.88s]  So it's only fitting that you do it again.
[7374.60s -> 7378.41s]  Yeah, and I was on East Coast time last year.
[7379.13s -> 7381.45s]  It's three hours behind in Vegas.
[7382.09s -> 7383.26s]  It's gonna be even harder.
[7383.26s -> 7384.30s]  I'm gonna look horrible.
[7384.86s -> 7393.00s]  I couldn't even get up at like noon.
[7395.28s -> 7396.24s]  God, I'll be fine.
[7396.24s -> 7396.72s]  I'll be here.
[7396.72s -> 7397.12s]  Don't worry.
[7398.75s -> 7402.43s]  Thank you SleepTiner for the $3.20.
[7402.43s -> 7403.15s]  Thanks for the stream.
[7403.87s -> 7405.10s]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[7405.66s -> 7406.99s]  Thanks for watching.
[7409.72s -> 7411.32s]  Snoozingcopter, thanks for the $2.50.
[7412.20s -> 7415.28s]  Derma just said he never lies to us.
[7415.28s -> 7417.28s]  That means we're finally going to see Ace Attorney.
[7417.92s -> 7423.12s]  Also really disappointed that we didn't see Babylon's fall at Square today.
[7423.12s -> 7426.16s]  They just teased it last year and now it seems forgotten.
[7426.16s -> 7429.36s]  Even though it looks so cool, it was co-developed by Platinum Games.
[7430.40s -> 7438.83s]  Yeah, I wasn't really grabbed by much of the Square stuff.
[7444.86s -> 7445.74s]  Not this year at least.
[7445.74s -> 7447.26s]  Except for maybe one or two little things.
[7447.98s -> 7456.56s]  I felt kind of bad because I was kind of just like sitting there.
[7457.04s -> 7461.93s]  Watching and like I don't really have much to say about any of these games.
[7464.44s -> 7466.52s]  But I just kind of just didn't really have much to say.
[7467.24s -> 7476.17s]  The cute deer game looked interesting.
[7479.92s -> 7480.32s]  It did.
[7480.32s -> 7481.20s]  You're right.
[7481.20s -> 7485.26s]  But thank you Snoozingcopter for the $2.50.
[7485.26s -> 7486.22s]  I lie all the time.
[7486.22s -> 7489.98s]  So Ace Attorney is encompassed in the lies.
[7493.40s -> 7495.96s]  And Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $2.50.
[7496.68s -> 7498.12s]  Smelly Boy, thanks for the $2.50.
[7498.76s -> 7501.85s]  Do you have a video on the main channel that points viewers to the second channel?
[7501.85s -> 7502.57s]  If not, why?
[7507.68s -> 7508.32s]  I don't know.
[7508.32s -> 7509.04s]  I just kind of don't.
[7509.60s -> 7512.56s]  The last video I made on the main channel just said that I was going to be streaming full time.
[7513.44s -> 7514.96s]  Or like at least a lot.
[7515.84s -> 7523.45s]  That was the doctor's appointment.
[7523.45s -> 7530.65s]  Spider-Man hasn't took a year for me to find Jerma 2.
[7532.99s -> 7536.75s]  It's weird because part of me feels like if I make a video on the main channel that says,
[7536.75s -> 7538.51s]  hey guys, remember me?
[7538.51s -> 7540.27s]  Well, this is not a video.
[7540.27s -> 7542.67s]  This is me telling you that there's another channel.
[7542.67s -> 7545.31s]  And oh, by the way, I'm still streaming.
[7545.31s -> 7546.67s]  This is not a video though.
[7547.39s -> 7549.61s]  I feel like that's like the hermit is coming out.
[7549.61s -> 7553.29s]  Like the rock is moving and there's like a crowd of people just waiting.
[7554.25s -> 7555.05s]  It's like a theater.
[7556.97s -> 7558.81s]  There's a giant rock in a cave.
[7558.81s -> 7561.45s]  And there's like fucking thousands of people all sitting there with popcorn
[7561.45s -> 7564.57s]  with like 3D glasses on waiting for the cave boulder to move.
[7565.69s -> 7567.05s]  And like here it starts to move.
[7568.57s -> 7569.29s]  Oh my god, it's moving.
[7569.29s -> 7572.01s]  And everyone fucking sits down, shuts up, turns their phones off and starts watching.
[7572.65s -> 7574.17s]  Holy shit, the boulder's moving.
[7574.97s -> 7578.70s]  And the bright lights hit me in the face.
[7578.70s -> 7580.22s]  I have a huge beard and I'm just like.
[7583.93s -> 7584.81s]  Here he is, he's back.
[7585.45s -> 7589.69s]  Hey, just going to use the bathroom.
[7590.41s -> 7593.29s]  And I grab a newspaper and just walk across the audience
[7593.85s -> 7594.97s]  and just go shit in the woods.
[7596.22s -> 7601.69s]  And then go back into the boulder and push it closed.
[7602.41s -> 7603.21s]  That's what that is.
[7613.23s -> 7616.03s]  No, I feel like I don't want to really do that.
[7617.13s -> 7618.49s]  Just do that as the video.
[7620.73s -> 7622.49s]  I feel like that would piss off so many people.
[7624.00s -> 7626.40s]  If I did that and I actually uploaded that,
[7626.40s -> 7629.44s]  people would be like, are we, what, I'm the audience member?
[7629.44s -> 7630.80s]  I'm like just sitting here waiting for you?
[7632.24s -> 7633.76s]  You think I'm just going to sit here and wait?
[7634.48s -> 7635.60s]  What, you think you're that important?
[7636.24s -> 7637.28s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[7637.28s -> 7638.08s]  Okay, fine, dick.
[7638.88s -> 7646.36s]  Just upload that.
[7646.36s -> 7647.08s]  What if I just did that?
[7648.44s -> 7651.80s]  Before I go to the cave, I'm just like, oh by the way,
[7652.83s -> 7656.19s]  there's a second turbo channel if you want to watch it
[7656.19s -> 7658.35s]  and I stream from inside this cave.
[7662.14s -> 7663.74s]  There's like this, you can peer over the shoulder
[7663.74s -> 7664.46s]  and zoom in a little bit.
[7664.46s -> 7665.74s]  There's like a streamer set up.
[7673.20s -> 7674.16s]  Cave office.
[7676.16s -> 7682.32s]  I would watch that.
[7682.32s -> 7682.80s]  I would too.
[7683.44s -> 7692.78s]  You aren't funny, stop doing voices.
[7692.78s -> 7695.18s]  You are, what is this like, what's this coffee pasta?
[7703.16s -> 7705.56s]  Oh shit, it's two, it's two, I'm fucked.
[7709.82s -> 7713.92s]  That's 100% more than the typical one guy.
[7726.33s -> 7727.77s]  Well, I can't stop doing voices
[7728.73s -> 7730.01s]  because too many people live up here.
[7733.12s -> 7734.72s]  I don't even know what you mean by voices.
[7734.72s -> 7736.40s]  This is just other people that are up in my head.
[7747.00s -> 7748.76s]  Sometimes they just kind of come out.
[7755.40s -> 7756.92s]  Legal ramifications of tomorrow?
[7756.92s -> 7758.52s]  What do you mean legal ramifications?
[7765.40s -> 7767.56s]  Chat lives up in my head, rent free.
[7769.56s -> 7771.26s]  Nah, it's not rent free.
[7780.62s -> 7781.74s]  Do they pay rent?
[7788.59s -> 7790.35s]  But somebody, I mean, they said like,
[7790.35s -> 7791.87s]  you're not funny, stop doing voices.
[7791.87s -> 7792.91s]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[7793.39s -> 7794.99s]  I have to disagree with you personally.
[7794.99s -> 7796.19s]  As the streamer, I was interviewed
[7796.83s -> 7799.31s]  by youngbostonfunnycomedians.org
[7800.35s -> 7801.31s]  when I was like 14.
[7801.31s -> 7804.83s]  And I almost won like the RU as funny contest.
[7805.87s -> 7810.52s]  So when I was like 15.
[7811.98s -> 7816.49s]  And I was in Beauty and the Beast as Gaston.
[7816.49s -> 7817.93s]  So I think I have some credentials.
[7829.63s -> 7830.59s]  Yeah, I was Gaston.
[7831.23s -> 7838.75s]  Was that really?
[7838.75s -> 7839.31s]  Of course I was.
[7841.21s -> 7842.81s]  And I did this great voice.
[7843.53s -> 7844.25s]  Let me tell you.
[7845.77s -> 7847.53s]  It was a really, really good voice.
[7852.94s -> 7853.58s]  No, I'm done.
[7853.58s -> 7854.38s]  I'm done.
[7854.38s -> 7855.34s]  I'm done.
[7855.34s -> 7856.06s]  No more of this.
[7859.23s -> 7860.91s]  This is the auto voice.
[7861.47s -> 7868.24s]  Oh shit, I just have to rock this.
[7874.43s -> 7876.03s]  No one, I'm not gonna read that.
[7882.65s -> 7883.45s]  Do it, do it.
[7883.45s -> 7884.49s]  You played yourself.
[7887.31s -> 7888.67s]  I play myself every day.
[7896.22s -> 7897.02s]  But let's move on.
[7899.71s -> 7900.67s]  I'll fix you though, don't worry.
[7908.86s -> 7909.50s]  Doesn't matter.
[7909.50s -> 7910.30s]  I could say anything.
[7910.86s -> 7912.38s]  And it's gonna just turn against me.
[7920.01s -> 7920.89s]  Thank you too.
[7923.50s -> 7924.14s]  Where are we?
[7927.18s -> 7929.18s]  Hey Jamie, thanks for the $5, Jamie.
[7929.18s -> 7930.14s]  Appreciate it.
[7930.14s -> 7933.69s]  Is no message.
[7933.69s -> 7935.61s]  Jamie2803, thanks for the $5.
[7935.61s -> 7939.45s]  Thank you Slater Ashby for the $5.
[7939.45s -> 7940.89s]  Jerma, I want to thank you.
[7942.75s -> 7944.19s]  Appreciate the $5.
[7944.19s -> 7944.91s]  Thanks for that.
[7946.92s -> 7949.72s]  Anything else show official?
[7949.72s -> 7950.68s]  Thanks for the $15.
[7954.48s -> 7954.80s]  Thank you.
[7954.80s -> 7955.76s]  Anything else show official?
[7956.40s -> 7957.04s]  15 bucks.
[7957.68s -> 7959.23s]  Hell yeah.
[7959.79s -> 7962.88s]  Had fun watching your drunken stream today, Jerma,
[7962.88s -> 7964.24s]  while I was sick with bronchitis.
[7965.18s -> 7969.58s]  But a bilateral ear infection and sinusitis.
[7969.58s -> 7971.34s]  So I hope you're glad you gave me some laughter
[7971.34s -> 7973.10s]  while I was dying, coughing, and sneezing today.
[7973.74s -> 7977.98s]  Well hopefully you're feeling all right.
[7978.62s -> 7985.08s]  Hopefully you're not like actually in like any pain or anything.
[7985.80s -> 7988.27s]  But I wish you a swift recovery.
[7988.27s -> 7989.31s]  Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[7992.46s -> 7993.82s]  Getting sick during the summer is the worst.
[7993.82s -> 7994.22s]  Yeah it is.
[7994.94s -> 7996.96s]  Because you just don't feel like you're supposed to be sick.
[7997.76s -> 8004.19s]  You feel like it's like sunny and nice out.
[8004.19s -> 8005.23s]  So it's just like why?
[8005.23s -> 8006.83s]  When it's cold and wintery and shitty out,
[8006.83s -> 8007.39s]  it doesn't matter.
[8007.39s -> 8008.51s]  It's like good I'll stay in bed.
[8009.47s -> 8015.13s]  But sorry to hear that.
[8015.13s -> 8016.41s]  Hopefully you get a swift recovery.
[8016.41s -> 8017.45s]  Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[8019.53s -> 8021.45s]  A vertebral giant.
[8021.45s -> 8022.49s]  Thanks for the $5.
[8023.77s -> 8025.53s]  Thanks for killing it with jokes tonight.
[8025.53s -> 8028.01s]  By the way, Twitch tweeted out your Christopher Walken joke
[8028.01s -> 8029.29s]  about Keanu Reeves.
[8029.29s -> 8030.41s]  Have a good one.
[8030.41s -> 8032.17s]  That was the worst joke I made yesterday.
[8032.89s -> 8035.24s]  That was such like a flat shit joke.
[8035.24s -> 8036.68s]  And people probably clicking on that gale night.
[8036.68s -> 8037.72s]  This guy sucks.
[8037.72s -> 8039.08s]  The person that said that my jokes suck
[8039.08s -> 8040.28s]  probably came here from that tweet.
[8041.08s -> 8041.72s]  Now I get it.
[8041.72s -> 8042.28s]  I understand.
[8051.55s -> 8052.27s]  No, it was fun.
[8052.27s -> 8052.83s]  That was fun.
[8056.89s -> 8059.21s]  But it was kind of the equivalent of me being like
[8059.21s -> 8060.65s]  pee-pee doo-doo.
[8060.65s -> 8061.45s]  Like poo-poo.
[8072.03s -> 8072.51s]  There it is.
[8072.51s -> 8073.15s]  Hilarious.
[8082.08s -> 8084.46s]  That's it.
[8084.46s -> 8085.50s]  That's what I do normally.
[8087.96s -> 8089.24s]  If you don't think this stream is funny,
[8089.24s -> 8091.40s]  I hope you find somebody that you think is funny.
[8091.40s -> 8092.92s]  Hope you find something to enjoy.
[8092.92s -> 8094.84s]  And if you enjoy not thinking that I'm funny,
[8094.84s -> 8095.72s]  I'm glad to have you.
[8095.72s -> 8096.36s]  Thanks for watching.
[8097.08s -> 8104.49s]  So we had a couple more from smellyboy250.
[8105.05s -> 8107.61s]  Disregard my last comment.
[8107.61s -> 8108.33s]  I eat ass.
[8110.00s -> 8110.48s]  Will do.
[8110.48s -> 8115.18s]  I will, I guess, disregard that comment.
[8115.18s -> 8115.68s]  Thanks.
[8117.37s -> 8118.89s]  DubskiDude, thanks for the 250.
[8118.89s -> 8120.89s]  I love the Dragon Quest series,
[8120.89s -> 8122.49s]  but I would say the constant puns
[8122.49s -> 8124.49s]  are extremely painful to read.
[8125.13s -> 8126.49s]  It's spine breaking.
[8127.05s -> 8128.57s]  They really localize it poorly,
[8128.57s -> 8130.49s]  but otherwise it's pretty fun off stream game.
[8133.90s -> 8134.46s]  Maybe I'll get it.
[8135.02s -> 8140.92s]  Maybe I'll give it a try.
[8146.03s -> 8147.63s]  I kind of need a new game just to lie down.
[8149.12s -> 8150.24s]  Just stare at a screen with...
[8151.12s -> 8153.80s]  Can I get that on?
[8153.80s -> 8155.08s]  What can I get that on?
[8155.08s -> 8155.58s]  Let's see.
[8156.28s -> 8159.16s]  Oh, let's get the credits on.
[8159.16s -> 8160.12s]  There were a lot of subs.
[8163.34s -> 8163.98s]  Let's show them.
[8164.62s -> 8168.03s]  I don't know what it is with these E3 streams,
[8168.03s -> 8169.47s]  but they like are killing my voice.
[8170.35s -> 8174.91s]  I mean, I've been drinking water.
[8175.47s -> 8178.22s]  Have I been talking more than usual?
[8178.22s -> 8178.86s]  I don't think so.
[8184.83s -> 8185.87s]  Not more than usual.
[8186.59s -> 8188.41s]  I think I'm just getting old.
[8188.41s -> 8189.13s]  Yeah, maybe I am.
[8192.78s -> 8193.66s]  But here comes the credits.
[8193.66s -> 8197.60s]  These are all the subs that were here today
[8197.60s -> 8198.64s]  on this stream tonight.
[8199.82s -> 8202.62s]  See you tomorrow morning for the Nintendo conference.
[8203.26s -> 8208.88s]  And then we'll probably hang out for like a little bit after that.
[8209.52s -> 8216.11s]  I'm going to show up late.
[8216.11s -> 8216.91s]  I can't.
[8216.91s -> 8218.03s]  I can't be late to these
[8218.83s -> 8219.87s]  because they start without you.
[8222.56s -> 8223.76s]  But thank you again, everybody,
[8223.76s -> 8227.76s]  for your continued support of this stream.
[8231.29s -> 8233.53s]  Hopefully you've been having fun on these E3 streams.
[8233.53s -> 8234.33s]  They're fun to do.
[8234.33s -> 8235.29s]  They're fun just to hang out.
[8236.09s -> 8239.74s]  And let's finish up.
[8239.74s -> 8241.10s]  There's only one more bit to do.
[8241.98s -> 8242.54s]  Or is there?
[8242.54s -> 8243.34s]  I think I already got it.
[8243.90s -> 8245.72s]  But yeah, I already got it.
[8250.83s -> 8253.31s]  So you mean you're only late when you can be late?
[8253.95s -> 8259.58s]  I mean, kind of.
[8259.58s -> 8261.50s]  But I mean, that's why I have the window now
[8261.50s -> 8263.18s]  to make sure that I kind of can't be.
[8266.57s -> 8268.65s]  But I'll see you bright and early.
[8268.65s -> 8270.25s]  Those of you that are going to be awake or around.
[8271.05s -> 8277.05s]  Have a great rest of your night
[8277.05s -> 8279.45s]  if you're going to check out some more of the E3 stuff.
[8279.45s -> 8279.85s]  I think there's...
[8279.85s -> 8280.97s]  Is there anything else going on tonight?
[8280.97s -> 8282.09s]  I don't think there is, right?
[8282.09s -> 8283.21s]  The Square Enix was the last one.
[8284.09s -> 8298.46s]  Am I only interested in the building one?
[8300.94s -> 8302.62s]  No, I would play Dragon Quest XI.
[8303.34s -> 8305.36s]  Don't think I would stream it,
[8305.36s -> 8306.24s]  but I would probably play it.
[8307.85s -> 8309.37s]  NVIDIA and Intel subs.
[8309.37s -> 8310.65s]  Well, somebody gave them subs.
[8319.50s -> 8319.98s]  Leo.
[8324.08s -> 8324.88s]  It is what it is.
[8327.40s -> 8329.48s]  I'm just glad I did the Dr. Island brain games
[8329.48s -> 8331.08s]  without too much of a problem.
[8331.72s -> 8333.16s]  That was a meltdown waiting to happen.
[8346.65s -> 8347.93s]  Leo Peepo dance.
[8351.66s -> 8352.38s]  Take care, guys.
[8353.02s -> 8355.50s]  Holy shit, there were a lot of subs.
[8356.30s -> 8361.60s]  You guys, generosity never ceases to amaze...
[8361.60s -> 8363.68s]  Oh, by the way, let's take a look at this
[8364.32s -> 8365.44s]  because I'm doing this next week.
[8366.00s -> 8368.08s]  Actually, not next week, but I'm doing this this weekend.
[8369.21s -> 8369.45s]  Yeah.
[8370.41s -> 8376.30s]  So after tomorrow, I will be live on Friday and Saturday.
[8379.02s -> 8381.10s]  Yeah, after tomorrow, I'm going to be live Friday, Saturday.
[8381.74s -> 8382.78s]  And we're doing this shit.
[8384.38s -> 8386.86s]  You want to show up to like a drunk asshole stream?
[8386.86s -> 8387.66s]  It's going to be this one.
[8388.54s -> 8393.15s]  What do you think we should do first?
[8396.00s -> 8397.04s]  Tombstone Express?
[8397.68s -> 8400.75s]  I mean like Tombstone Express?
[8402.49s -> 8403.21s]  What else we got?
[8404.01s -> 8410.27s]  The Squeak and Sausage Unlock Adventure
[8413.23s -> 8415.23s]  or the Exotic Expedition.
[8415.79s -> 8420.28s]  We're going to try to beat these.
[8422.43s -> 8426.51s]  These are card games that you play with yourself
[8427.87s -> 8428.67s]  or with a friend.
[8429.55s -> 8430.83s]  But we're going to do that.
[8430.83s -> 8431.95s]  You and I are going to do this.
[8434.25s -> 8436.09s]  It has an app that you sit on a table
[8436.65s -> 8440.17s]  and you essentially have to escape from the encounter.
