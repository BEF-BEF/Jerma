[1.14s -> 7.26s]  Sup. How you doing? How you been? How's your family? How's your father? How's your mother?
[8.06s -> 18.76s]  How are you kids? Good? Good. Good to hear. Just open up. Crack open a fresh beer. Okay.
[19.64s -> 29.16s]  Early. Now gift 2,000 subs. That's not part of the deal. That's not part of the deal.
[30.20s -> 37.86s]  I said if I was even one minute after two o'clock. I said I was gonna be early.
[38.66s -> 44.02s]  If I wasn't early I was gonna gift a thousand subs and this is this is 30 minutes early.
[44.02s -> 55.32s]  Just about 30 minutes early. Something like that. I do have something very very quick to say though.
[56.04s -> 60.20s]  While people trickle in. Very very important stuff that I want everyone to pay attention to.
[60.20s -> 69.13s]  So listen up if you could. Sonic is the number one movie in the world. It's the funniest movie of the
[69.13s -> 77.38s]  year. Critics and audiences agree. Sonic is the funniest movie in America. Sonic the head
[77.38s -> 86.78s]  shark. Reddit BG. Critics agree. Sonic is the funniest movie ever made. Audiences say Sonic is
[86.78s -> 91.50s]  the funniest movie of the year. You know how many fucking times I've had to hear that?
[95.32s -> 103.32s]  It's burned into my brain. I've heard it so many times. I keep hearing it and I'm not even trying
[103.32s -> 110.74s]  to. Stop watching TV. I can't. Sonic is the number one movie of the year. It worked. They got me.
[117.85s -> 125.54s]  I laughed. Yeah yeah. Sonic is the number one movie in America. It's the funniest movie of the year.
[126.90s -> 132.82s]  Critics and audiences agree. On Rotten Tomatoes. They do that shit now. They do that. They start
[132.82s -> 140.15s]  talking about Rotten Tomatoes. Dave L from Rotten Tomatoes says I shit my pants. It was so embarrassed.
[140.15s -> 150.07s]  Sonic was the funniest movie I've ever seen. I feel really bad about the movie theater.
[150.71s -> 153.59s]  Hopefully somebody can help clean that up. Should I help?
[155.06s -> 158.42s]  68% on Rotten Tomatoes. It's the funniest movie of the year.
[160.97s -> 173.37s]  Okay. Let's go. Are you using a voice changer? Nah. What? I don't do that. Oh we got a wink.
[173.93s -> 181.86s]  Real quick. We got a wink. Does it have a camera set up? Oh shit. I don't even have my camera set
[181.86s -> 194.14s]  up. Two winks. What? Oh shit. That is two winks. Get him out now. He's disabling the voice changer.
[194.14s -> 203.16s]  I've heard him in real life. He always sounds like that. It's the funniest movie of the year.
[206.90s -> 217.37s]  Ten winks? No. I can't. I can't stop doing it. That's going to be what's going to happen today.
[217.37s -> 232.38s]  I'll do it like 30 more times. I'm sorry. Talking black and white. Oh I've got a wink. Two distinct
[232.38s -> 244.87s]  winks. Ten thousand points equals funny voice. No. I'm not going to replace winks with something
[244.87s -> 252.60s]  else that I have to say or do. We're going to make some cool channel point stuff. You'll see.
[253.75s -> 260.30s]  No brace today. Yeah. I'm trying to loosen up a little bit. I've been a little tight so I don't
[260.30s -> 269.69s]  want to put a bunch of weight on me and pressing in. I want to be a little loose today. But we're
[269.69s -> 275.69s]  going to do black and white too as you see. We left off last night. I want to play until I'm kind of
[275.77s -> 280.82s]  done. I'm still having a good time. I think it's still fun. Where's the audio?
[283.22s -> 284.02s]  Why is there no audio?
[286.98s -> 291.06s]  Hold on a second. What the fuck is going on here? Can you guys hear this? I don't hear anything.
[292.74s -> 297.06s]  It's because the game is paused. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You're right.
[297.06s -> 308.89s]  All right. Oh, there it is. There it is. Okay. So if you want to get some zoom out here,
[309.69s -> 319.82s]  you can see what we've been doing. This Murius growing up big and strong. If you missed last
[319.82s -> 327.48s]  night, Murius beat the absolute shit out of somebody. Murius has a bunch of new fighting
[327.48s -> 336.34s]  techniques. Is he planting flowers? Who's doing the flowers? That's not one of the fighting
[336.34s -> 346.81s]  techniques, but that's still pretty sick. Look at that dance. Are people pretending to like this?
[348.89s -> 364.66s]  That's a sick wedding dance. No, they do like it. They love it. I love them. I'm a bit hungry.
[366.04s -> 372.74s]  Well, eat something here. Eat this. Yeah. If you just caught the stream today and you didn't
[372.74s -> 379.66s]  catch yesterday's, we're about... eat it. What are you afraid of grain? What's wrong with you?
[380.62s -> 394.60s]  What? What's the skull? I mean, somebody's dead. Here, eat. Eat this. If you're hungry, please.
[395.64s -> 401.82s]  Eat it. Eat it. It's good. I'm fine. You just said you were hungry.
[402.70s -> 421.13s]  Broccoli. I don't like broccoli. Holy shit. That face. All right. Fine. Fine. Do whatever you want
[421.13s -> 427.10s]  with it. All right. I got to take over two more towns by force. I'm doing pretty well. Look at
[427.50s -> 432.14s]  my city. We've got the development over here. We've got this little town this way. We've got
[432.14s -> 434.70s]  some development this way. We've got some development over here. We've got a couple
[434.70s -> 439.50s]  more developments. We have some developing over here. The idea is I need to spread my influence.
[439.50s -> 446.73s]  We're going to build up this way. I just took this town and I think it's time to take another one.
[447.37s -> 453.86s]  What's above here? Oh shit. Are there people here? Yeah, this is mine. This is mine. I need
[453.86s -> 465.11s]  citizens. Anybody live here? Nobody lives here. Okay. I'm going to start building towns.
[469.16s -> 472.20s]  Actually, I want you. You guys take a walk over here. You take this town too.
[477.51s -> 481.96s]  That one's pretty far away, but it'll give me some more influence. Remember that's my house.
[483.38s -> 490.66s]  Well, it's sorry. What you meant to say was it's my house. This is my house. No,
[493.91s -> 497.03s]  but that's what's happening. No, it's mine. No, that's actually it's mine.
[497.83s -> 502.73s]  It's mine now because I'm going to get it. It's mine. Can I just take this one too? Maybe I'll
[502.73s -> 508.38s]  take this one first. Yeah, I'll take this one first. Wait, he's got an army over here. No,
[508.38s -> 515.56s]  no, no. That's not that big of an army. That army sucks. Take it. Take this. I'm going to
[515.56s -> 527.37s]  send Murius up here too. Where's the archers? How come the archers don't have a flag? Where's
[527.37s -> 538.14s]  the archers flag? Why is this guy going so fast? Oh, the archers are already on the way down to
[538.14s -> 546.79s]  the other town. This is perfect. Perfect. All right, Murius, I need you. You have to start
[546.79s -> 555.13s]  to spread some influence here. Come with me and then we're going to make new base of operations
[555.13s -> 566.34s]  up here. This would be perfect. All right, well, here comes some resistance, you know,
[566.34s -> 580.63s]  to do Murius. Get fucking angry. They think that, oh, they're archers. They're archers. All right,
[580.63s -> 587.93s]  get in, get in, go in. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is important. Go attack, attack, attack.
[589.05s -> 607.06s]  They'll just stop picking everybody off. Attack. Just kill them. Murius, get up here. Good. Good.
[607.06s -> 611.53s]  They all leveled up. Nice. All right, come on, bring it in. Wait, you're not sending everybody,
[611.53s -> 621.99s]  are you? Defend, defend, defend. Fight, fight each other. What are you doing? It's not musical
[621.99s -> 644.79s]  chairs. Fucking start swinging. What are you doing? We're good. Murius, dude, this is not going well.
[647.50s -> 659.56s]  What are they doing? Why are they like, are we winning? I don't think we're winning.
[661.06s -> 667.69s]  Build up them troop numbers. Okay, why did we just get stomped? It was like 30 of us.
[674.23s -> 681.32s]  Murius, what are you doing over here? Murius, you're just stepping on our own. All right,
[681.32s -> 684.76s]  here, I don't know what the fuck you've done, Murius, but we're taking this town instead.
[685.40s -> 694.39s]  Murius with the other way. Why did you go the other way? You got fucking distracted. No,
[694.39s -> 700.60s]  not time to take a piss in the woods. Let's go over here. Support your friends. The gate is closed.
[700.60s -> 708.44s]  He doesn't know how to open the gate. He doesn't know how to open the gate. Oh, fuck. Okay,
[708.44s -> 729.32s]  whatever. Just hang out over here. What are you up to? Come here. Let's cap this. Okay.
[730.12s -> 737.78s]  God damn it. Hey, never trust Nanner's. Thanks for the 10 community subs. Thank you. Never
[737.78s -> 744.49s]  trust Nanner's. It's an old, old YouTube. All right, he's kicking. That's good. Old YouTube,
[745.69s -> 751.14s]  old YouTube series, huh? It's an old one. I wish I could get this one without a problem.
[751.14s -> 760.74s]  Murius is up here now. The mine workers have to walk so far. Wait, why are they going all the
[760.74s -> 775.72s]  way over here? Why are they doing this? Or there's no ore in here. Oh, shit.
[782.46s -> 790.09s]  Do I get some tribute? Let me see if I can find anything. Multi hand pickup. Extend your grabbing
[790.09s -> 794.01s]  ability and pick up many tribes people at once. But you can pick. Yeah, I like this.
[795.32s -> 799.16s]  Click and hold with the action button when picking up an object to engage multi pick.
[799.72s -> 811.59s]  All right, that's good. I like that. I want that. Multi pick up is nice. Yeah, it seems like it's
[811.59s -> 817.21s]  pretty nice. So there's no more ore in here. We'll have this city. Where's the nearest ore?
[817.21s -> 824.76s]  Up here? Shit. How am I going to do this? Am I going to have to make like a store room over
[824.76s -> 836.44s]  here or just people are going to have to walk? Oh dear. Okay. He's coming back this way. He's
[836.44s -> 844.49s]  not coming all the way down. I got archers. That should be okay. Are you going to get a lizard?
[845.13s -> 854.15s]  Probably not. All right, let's keep working. How are we doing on breeding? What does the
[854.15s -> 861.88s]  population look like? Looking for food, but people are unhappy. We got 500. There's still
[861.88s -> 870.78s]  300 male to female ratio. 300 male to... Wait, why is this still like double the amount of men?
[871.66s -> 885.72s]  I don't understand. All right, let's get some more groups here.
[885.72s -> 900.62s]  Let's do like 50. No, let's do like 70. What's wrong with the cow? He's just kicking stuff.
[901.82s -> 916.30s]  Look, I came over and he loves me. He's so happy to see me. Turn your blinker off.
[920.38s -> 925.18s]  Ah, shit. How long has the blinker been on? We've been on the highway for two hours.
[926.86s -> 940.18s]  Oh, I feel like a fucking real asshole. Let's get some. This is still mine. It's time to build
[940.18s -> 951.75s]  in here. They don't have anything. They didn't have anything. That's all, folks. How do I drop
[951.75s -> 963.64s]  it? Okay, I'll do it. I'm just going to play this all out. Let's get a bunch of wood because I want
[963.64s -> 974.25s]  to build some shit over here so we get some plenty of wood. All right, I got a store. I want a field
[974.25s -> 985.08s]  up here for food. What the hell is that? Because they don't have... I mean, they have one field over
[985.08s -> 1000.47s]  here. They have a granary, though. You missed Wink? No, I didn't. Take over three towns by force. I
[1000.47s -> 1007.85s]  must have it. There's no fucking people that live here. Let's get some small houses. Let's get a
[1007.85s -> 1016.06s]  couple of villas. That's a nursery. Villa. Why do they... why do they always... they're already
[1016.06s -> 1030.86s]  pissed off about this? That's okay. They're unhappy in certain places. Okay,
[1032.63s -> 1043.58s]  they're happy next to the storeroom? Actual Wink? Well, use the one I just did.
[1045.91s -> 1053.51s]  Fucking that stupid thing, man. That shit's got to go. It's not even hard to do, but you know
[1053.51s -> 1073.02s]  what I mean? It's just got to go. It's not even hard to do it. I just did it. Another... oh my god.
[1077.05s -> 1098.12s]  Wink again, slave. We take a town. Oh, they captured that town. Well, it's mine now, stupid.
[1102.78s -> 1110.02s]  I'm soaking. Yes, you are. All right, now I got to build a war room. We're going to put these guys
[1110.02s -> 1120.12s]  away. We're going to make them live here. We need an archer factory. I want these people to just
[1120.12s -> 1130.90s]  start populating here. So, another one. Because can they live in these houses? I'm sure they can.
[1131.62s -> 1137.99s]  All right, Murius, you can go back to doing what you were doing. Use some free will.
[1138.63s -> 1150.10s]  Go, go do whatever you want. Another one. No, that was... is it really? Holy shit. Okay,
[1150.10s -> 1158.01s]  you're not lying. All right, whatever. All right, I need to build an archer factory.
[1172.22s -> 1179.56s]  Put this over here. No, put this like down here. What's the... all right, there we go. Right there.
[1180.12s -> 1195.94s]  Take some of this wood. Dump it on here. Every time a streamer winks, an angel gets its wings.
[1200.90s -> 1219.16s]  Huh? That's them. We need more food. Pronto. I like that word. Pronto. We need ore.
[1219.16s -> 1224.78s]  Ore is going to be... All right, I need you to get ore. Murius, come here. It's time for you to gather
[1225.42s -> 1242.26s]  ore. You can do it. You're very smart. Fake winks? I know. I can see them. I can see the winks.
[1242.26s -> 1254.02s]  I know which ones are real and which ones are fake. All right, let's turn these guys back into...
[1254.26s -> 1260.20s]  Uh, let's make them just citizens. We're gonna have them live here. They're gonna start to collect
[1260.20s -> 1276.44s]  shit here. I'm gonna bring the other army who are this way. You guys right here. Fortify here.
[1277.48s -> 1283.43s]  Open this door first. They're gonna... I don't want to leave this just open.
[1285.58s -> 1300.09s]  You guys can live here and shit. Got another wall to build. Good. Build it. Continue to fortify.
[1300.57s -> 1315.22s]  The ticking is the wink counter? Oh shit. Can I even do this? Okay. That was um... How many was
[1315.22s -> 1339.27s]  that? That was like... That was like 20? 30? Inflation. We need ore. We need more. We need more
[1339.27s -> 1351.67s]  gold. We need more lumber. I'll take care of it. Don't worry. This winking shit is stupid. That's
[1351.67s -> 1357.88s]  why it's going away. Citizen of the German community. Yes, the winking will not exist
[1357.88s -> 1371.46s]  anymore as of next week. So, hey, don't worry. He won't be here anymore. Why, Pepehands? Why?
[1372.58s -> 1376.92s]  What do you mean nobody said that? It was very clear. Someone was like, this is dumb. And then
[1376.92s -> 1388.33s]  I'm like, yeah. And then they said, yeah. And they agreed. Trust me. I agree. All right. Get the
[1388.33s -> 1395.48s]  creature to help build 30 houses. All right. People live in here now? Are there any women? Oh no,
[1395.48s -> 1402.18s]  it's all men. All right. I need to... I need to get some breeding going on up here. And then those...
[1403.14s -> 1418.42s]  Let's start farming. Foresting. Get to the mine. Wait, breed. Yeah.
[1429.48s -> 1434.54s]  How does she sound stoned?
[1438.06s -> 1443.48s]  Does she? Not really. What? What are you talking about?
[1454.97s -> 1459.05s]  All right. This town is going to start rocking here. Let me get a, uh, a field.
[1461.45s -> 1483.90s]  And go. Let's water that field. Are we doing an ore? You can multi-pick people too. Ah,
[1483.90s -> 1486.22s]  shit. That's right. I forgot about that. Thanks for the reminder.
[1490.42s -> 1504.68s]  Iris, what are you picking up? Wait, what is that? No, no. You're getting... You need to get the
[1504.68s -> 1518.01s]  mine. Where did he even get the tree? Where is he getting the trees? No, there's wood on the ground.
[1518.01s -> 1528.01s]  No, no. Don't pick up the fucking... One pebble. You could go into the mine and pick up a huge one.
[1528.01s -> 1539.85s]  This is like worth 10 cents, Murius. That's not worth very much. 1305. Okay. It was 95 ore. Good
[1539.85s -> 1550.70s]  work. But pick up the big ones. This is when a little kid actually helps you clean the house.
[1553.08s -> 1557.48s]  You've got like four bags of laundry on your back. You've got a mop in your hand. You mop in the
[1557.48s -> 1562.60s]  floor and they come over and they're like, I found this on the ground. It's like, oh yeah. That's...
[1562.60s -> 1568.68s]  What is that? Oh, that's a hair tie. Yeah. Good. Okay. Good work. Good. Yeah. Oh, mom's kind of
[1568.68s -> 1580.47s]  busy right now though. Okay. I found a coin. Oh, good. Yeah. Thanks for the coin. Okay. Yeah. Good
[1580.47s -> 1584.95s]  cleaning. We're cleaning. We're cleaning. We make up a song about cleaning. And then they go like,
[1584.95s -> 1611.34s]  yay! They get fucking happy. Stop doing the mom role play. He's not doing very much. He needs
[1611.34s -> 1620.92s]  to learn more. All right. Okay. What do I have? I need to... I still don't understand that.
[1621.80s -> 1637.70s]  Let's get some more food. All right. This town is going to start to become good. What is this? Is
[1637.70s -> 1649.38s]  this a temple? It's a temple. Did he just put sand in there? All right. I need... I need tribute.
[1650.95s -> 1657.51s]  Gathering. I will always gather ore. Good. So now let me... What's the next town? What would...
[1657.51s -> 1663.21s]  The next goal is to start to encroach. So I'm actually not going to do any violence here.
[1663.85s -> 1670.20s]  I'm going to build up and get to right about here. Or is it always violence? What do you think?
[1670.84s -> 1692.38s]  It's over here. Always violence? No, not always. What is this? A maze?
[1707.59s -> 1711.67s]  If you spend the signs, you might be able to get them through safely.
[1711.67s -> 1718.39s]  Those dumb ambushes will also follow the signs so we can send them on a wild ghost chase and make
[1718.39s -> 1729.22s]  sure the spy gets through. What? Oh no. Okay. Make sure the spy gets through. Wait, do I just have to...
[1729.22s -> 1760.26s]  Hold on. Save it. Oh, they seek me here. They seek me. You have to turn the signs.
[1762.04s -> 1775.19s]  Okay. Save it again. Where does he need to go? Oh God. Wait, what is it? Which way does he need
[1775.19s -> 1813.96s]  to go? I don't know which way he's actually supposed to end up. Here? Up here. Where does
[1813.96s -> 1834.22s]  he need to go? Right here? Over here? Oh, right there. Don't turn this way. I win. Wait. I'm in
[1834.22s -> 1838.94s]  a weird fucked up camera spot right now. Oh my God. I'm trying to move the fuck over here,
[1838.94s -> 1853.64s]  but I can't move. I'm trying to get this... This is fucking RTS bullshit. I didn't get it. I got it.
[1864.44s -> 1867.96s]  This isn't going to be an actual living hell because when you get down here and you try to
[1867.96s -> 1879.69s]  move around, it's like... I just tried. I just tried to move like five times. You saw it happen
[1879.69s -> 1907.03s]  in real time. I was trying to move the camera and I was stuck on like a rock behind me. Here we go.
[1907.75s -> 1921.77s]  I'll get it. Remember, your odor is foul. Whatever. I'm going to tell you.
[1926.17s -> 1928.81s]  Using natural sea salt underneath my arms. What are you talking about?
[1935.85s -> 1947.46s]  Where's the next one? Or is it the left? All right. So this is okay. We're going to go... We just
[1947.46s -> 1956.79s]  got to follow that, whoever this guy was. We're going to go left and this guy's coming up.
[1956.79s -> 1965.69s]  Turn this around. Which way is he going to go? Is he going to go straight up or is he going to
[1965.69s -> 1986.42s]  take a right? All right. We're good. All right. It's okay. He's going to go before I do. Yeah,
[1986.42s -> 2005.64s]  we're good. It's the new follow the guide mission. Hold on. Save it. Type a check. Let me see. We're
[2005.64s -> 2016.46s]  good. All right. Wait, what do I want to... This way. And then over here. Anybody else coming? All
[2016.46s -> 2022.68s]  right. This guy is. Turn that sign this way. Make this guy have to walk around the whole fucking
[2022.68s -> 2033.56s]  thing. Who else is around? Anybody? I... Anybody here? Wait. Guy coming. Who's going to get there
[2033.56s -> 2043.38s]  first? Who's going to get there first? Turn. What? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[2043.38s -> 2054.82s]  We're good. We're good. We're good. Save it right here. All right. We're good. I'm going to get the
[2054.82s -> 2074.26s]  second piece of fucking info. Nobody else, right? Okay. I'm offended on all sides until I get this.
[2074.90s -> 2102.71s]  Cancel germawink and replace it with germapoop. Why did you read that one? Because I like to read
[2102.71s -> 2111.06s]  the oddities. I'm a collector of oddities in chat. You have another piece of information.
[2111.06s -> 2124.87s]  Save game. Where's the last one? Okay. The last one is right over here. What do we have to deal
[2124.87s -> 2139.19s]  with? Is there a guy coming? It doesn't look like it. Let's check this out. All right. I go down here.
[2140.07s -> 2159.70s]  This guy right here. Oh man. Oh my god. There's so many people. Um, I think I did it. I'm going to do
[2159.70s -> 2194.68s]  it. All right. Nobody coming. Save it right here. Please one guy me. I got you. So how many more do
[2194.68s -> 2204.12s]  I need? Two more? Three more? Bounce it back. You have another piece of information now.
[2204.76s -> 2215.06s]  How many more are there? All right. So if I go here and then go this way, there ain't nobody over
[2215.06s -> 2225.37s]  here. Save it just in case something fucked up happens. And then we wrap around here. There's
[2225.37s -> 2242.68s]  nobody here. Another scroll. And then there's, I have no idea. Where's this last one? All right.
[2242.68s -> 2260.22s]  We got a guy coming. Spin this guy around this way. Is there one down here? Oh shit. Where is he?
[2260.22s -> 2276.63s]  Into you. I think that's it. Excellent. You have all of the necessary pieces of information.
[2276.63s -> 2287.37s]  Now what? Information. Did it. I can't believe it. I can't wait to see Sonic the Hedgehog.
[2287.37s -> 2307.90s]  It's the funniest movie of the year. Don't stop doing that joke. Well done.
[2308.70s -> 2325.05s]  You know. 40,000 tribute. I'll take that tribute and I'll bank it. 40,000 tribute. All right. Any
[2325.05s -> 2342.39s]  more? Any more scrolls? Any more scrolls? Oh, my poor dolly. You look so poorly. What on earth is
[2342.39s -> 2354.28s]  wrong with you? What? That sheep isn't ill. It's giving birth. Catch her lambs or they'll get hurt.
[2354.28s -> 2361.16s]  Catch the lambs? Better go nice with some potatoes. Maybe a little salad, you know,
[2361.16s -> 2371.51s]  little onions, tomato. Yeah, that'd be nice. Little tasty. Here comes another. Now put it down.
[2371.51s -> 2387.38s]  Save the game. What does this do? I used to cast it a water spell.
[2397.75s -> 2410.55s]  Wink for the fans. Hold on. Dude, this is fucking morbid. You know what I mean? Like,
[2410.55s -> 2442.07s]  what the heck? This is so fucking morbid. More? More? Fire it. Oh, that one's
[2442.71s -> 2448.71s]  spinning. Ten lambs saved. How many more do I save the lambs? Ten more? Do I have to have
[2448.71s -> 2471.66s]  ten completed? Ten total? Uh oh. Well, that one, I think that one hit the ground. How many more?
[2471.66s -> 2479.48s]  This is quite the litter. How many babies does a lamb have? They don't have like 20 babies at once.
[2479.48s -> 2497.51s]  No, they don't. They have like one. That's 20. Sheep can lay up to 16 eggs.
[2506.18s -> 2512.58s]  Yeah, it just goes it swims around and then puts them on a lily pad. Get ready. Here it comes.
[2513.54s -> 2531.96s]  That one hit the ground. That's really funny. Seriously, that's like, that's almost as funny
[2532.84s -> 2538.92s]  as the funniest movie of the year. Sonic the Hedgehog. Critics and audiences are saying
[2538.92s -> 2546.71s]  it's the best movie of the year. I told you I wasn't gonna stop doing it. I told you.
[2546.71s -> 2552.87s]  You're better now. And we've got these new friends to play with. You did it, leader. It's invasive.
[2556.02s -> 2562.66s]  It's February. I know that's fucking stupid. Oh, dude, can you believe the funniest movie
[2562.66s -> 2585.10s]  of the year? It's been like six and a half weeks. I'm gonna see it though. I am. I'm gonna see it.
[2585.74s -> 2589.82s]  You're not gonna tell me I'm not gonna see the Sonic the Hedgehog movie. Why would I not?
[2590.70s -> 2593.98s]  The same reason why I saw cats by myself in the theater. Nobody wanted to go with me. I
[2593.98s -> 2598.17s]  went by myself. And I just was sitting there going like this the whole time.
[2599.29s -> 2625.34s]  That's literally me when I watch your streams. Oh, get the fuck out of here. Oh, the wink. I forgot
[2625.34s -> 2647.08s]  to wink. That's me. All right. What was I doing? Oh, I want to do it again. So bad. I know. Okay.
[2648.04s -> 2652.73s]  When the stream's off, I'm gonna do this every fucking 10 seconds in my own house.
[2653.37s -> 2663.96s]  I don't have to worry about it. Pot market. No, I need to upgrade various.
[2666.07s -> 2675.05s]  Siege workshop. Powerful siege engines to do battle. These machines can attack fortifications
[2675.05s -> 2683.03s]  and buildings with a power no man could hope to match. Should I teach them water? What about
[2683.03s -> 2694.20s]  a university? All right. Intelligence or violence? University. All right. Let's teach them something
[2694.28s -> 2704.15s]  else too. Heal miracle. Smelter. Advanced entertainment. I don't think I want that.
[2705.35s -> 2711.70s]  Should I get the siege? Water miracle. I don't know what to do. Smelter. Probably that smelter
[2711.70s -> 2725.58s]  is so necessary. I don't have, I gotta get it. 25,000. I can also do a lamp. Pot market. No,
[2725.58s -> 2731.32s]  no. Let's save it. Save the money. You didn't research advanced entertainment. I know. All
[2731.32s -> 2741.11s]  right. Wow. We need food. Who needs it? There's food over here. This is fine. Where's uh, where's
[2741.11s -> 2750.90s]  Murius? Oh, Murius. You probably don't want to do this anymore. I guess you're, yeah, you're good.
[2750.90s -> 2755.38s]  You're good. Do whatever you want. I'm really lonely. Okay. Entertainment time. Go be an
[2755.38s -> 2778.30s]  entertainer. I'm feeling a bit ignored. That shoulder. This is bad posture. Okay. You good?
[2778.30s -> 2788.28s]  Go play. Go play. Go entertain. Go have fun. Let's go back to where I was before here.
[2788.28s -> 2797.03s]  Tons of shit going on. We need more food. How many people exist?
[2801.29s -> 2807.99s]  We're almost at max population here. I need more houses. All right. We're going to go up this way
[2807.99s -> 2815.94s]  with houses. I'm also going to put a smelter over here. Melt her first because this is where the
[2815.94s -> 2829.22s]  mine actually even is. All right. Smelt. Hey, what are you doing? It's going to come back and hit him.
[2830.18s -> 2832.90s]  It's going to throw it into the wall. It's going to bounce back and hit him in the face.
[2832.90s -> 2852.76s]  He's going to get even more angry. All right. Smelter. I don't want to do it again. I want to,
[2852.76s -> 2867.21s]  but I'm not going to. What's he laughing at? He's laughing at war? I love how he just makes
[2867.21s -> 2879.64s]  himself laugh. Those people don't have any houses to sleep in. Is he laughing? Oh no, he's puking.
[2881.72s -> 2897.40s]  Oh, he's puking on people. Be gentle. Gentle. Gentle. They're your friends. Yes. All right.
[2897.40s -> 2912.14s]  That might be two broken legs. Good. Okay. See? All right. Smelter's online. That's good. No,
[2912.14s -> 2917.18s]  I also got a, what else did I get? I got something else too, right? Let's get a market in here so
[2917.18s -> 2933.48s]  everyone's happy. All right. Murius, can we favor? Build that. Build that. Help me out. Do some stuff.
[2933.64s -> 2944.95s]  Help me. All right. I also unlocked. What else did I unlock? Something else too, right? University.
[2944.95s -> 2948.23s]  There it is. All right. Let's bring this over here. This is where the most people are.
[2950.79s -> 2956.49s]  University can go. That's a, I mean, that's a pretty good spot for it. Or right over here.
[2956.49s -> 2968.54s]  No, right here. University. Please tell me what Sonic is. I don't know. It's a movie
[2969.26s -> 2977.66s]  that they remade almost the whole movie because, uh, Sonic was looked like a real hedgehog,
[2977.66s -> 2982.46s]  not a, like the actual Sonic the Hedgehog. It made him look like a person hedgehog thing with
[2982.46s -> 2986.70s]  like human teeth and shit. It was weird. From the writings of their scholars.
[2987.66s -> 2999.18s]  All right. There we go. So people are going to use this. Get the creature to help build 30 houses.
[3000.41s -> 3010.89s]  Build a wonder. Still like research of wonder. Mansion skyscraper. Is that a wonder?
[3012.66s -> 3022.25s]  Bats. Best siege engine. Meteor amphitheater. Best a hundred soldiers. Best a hundred archers.
[3022.25s -> 3028.73s]  Here we go. Wonders. This is fucking 600,000. I'm not going to have that. How am I going to get that?
[3029.29s -> 3036.65s]  Is this a funny movie compared to others that may have come out in the last six and a half weeks?
[3037.53s -> 3047.06s]  Um, yeah. I mean, of the year so far, I would think so. Probably. From what I've heard,
[3049.53s -> 3056.65s]  on all the stupid amount of AdSense space that they've paid for to make sure to tell me that
[3056.65s -> 3070.38s]  every day. More than once a day. Uh, okay. Good job. Did you do it? You did it. Okay. Now build.
[3070.46s -> 3075.74s]  We need a, we need some houses up here. I want a well too. Build this too. Build everything.
[3075.74s -> 3093.75s]  I'm getting tired. Build that. You can do it. Get a manor in here. All right. I gotta get them off
[3093.75s -> 3116.09s]  this leash. But continue to build though. Not enough space for a manor. My house. Come on.
[3116.73s -> 3121.53s]  Then we're going to put a well right here. The university is going to go over here too.
[3126.41s -> 3144.04s]  Right there. All right. Now we can build it. Repeat the joke. More wood. Place Wink with
[3144.04s -> 3165.10s]  wasting points. But it just says you throw away 75,000 points. People are using it because they
[3165.10s -> 3169.90s]  know they're going away. It's so, it's actually like a, it's an interesting, uh, experiment if
[3169.90s -> 3176.15s]  you will. Because people know it's going away. So they're like, oh fuck. I gotta, I gotta use it
[3176.15s -> 3188.06s]  now before they become worthless. It's, uh, I'm saving for whatever's next. It's smart.
[3188.86s -> 3205.45s]  Saving for the future. We do need wood. Yeah, you do. Um, what am I supposed to do about this?
[3206.01s -> 3216.15s]  What happens if you run out of wood? Game over. That's game over. If you run out of wood.
[3221.74s -> 3238.71s]  Getting concerned about this. I'm getting concerned here. Wait, Munga S question mark.
[3238.71s -> 3245.19s]  Is this the time for me to do this? I say Munga S. I mean, as I think so, this is kind of scary.
[3246.63s -> 3264.70s]  We need wood. Gentle. What did you do? Don't throw them. I'm going to rip out and gather that tree.
[3264.70s -> 3276.23s]  Good. Very useful, Murius. Thank you. Is this a Munga? I don't know if it is. I had a story
[3276.23s -> 3283.10s]  to tell you guys. I don't remember what it was. It was weird. I'm trying to remember what the hell
[3283.10s -> 3302.31s]  it was. What was the story? Oh, nothing to do with Sonic. Um, what was it? I don't remember.
[3302.95s -> 3314.30s]  Maybe it'll come to me eventually one day. French fries? No, no, nothing to do with French fries.
[3315.26s -> 3327.32s]  All right. Now we have some actual settlements here. It's time to go get it. Why are you looking
[3327.32s -> 3348.28s]  at me? I like, I sometimes decide to get wood. Yes. Very good. We'll go get it. I want wood.
[3348.28s -> 3353.24s]  We'll go get it. It's right next to your town. I'm getting it. Look at me.
[3353.96s -> 3366.90s]  Disciple Forester. Do we have a lumber mill? If I don't, I will soon. Disciple Forester. No
[3366.90s -> 3372.47s]  lumber mill here? What the fuck am I even doing with my fucking life right now? No lumber mill.
[3373.11s -> 3382.79s]  I think I just want to drop somebody in the torch pit and just see what happens.
[3384.12s -> 3390.90s]  Ranery. We need lumber mill. There it is. All right. Let's get this right over here.
[3393.72s -> 3396.92s]  Okay. How much wood does it need? A lot. Not very much. It needs a lot of ore.
[3397.64s -> 3404.20s]  It's a very cool game. It is. It is very cool game. I agree. That's why we're doing it. Two
[3404.20s -> 3416.25s]  streams in a row because I'm still having fun. Is chat behaving? Yeah. Yeah, they are. They're
[3416.25s -> 3431.02s]  doing just fine. Taking a nap. All right. Now we get foresters. We have, how's this town actually
[3431.02s -> 3441.35s]  even doing though? More wood. What do they want for desires? They're okay. They want more children.
[3443.13s -> 3448.73s]  Uh, you're a farmer. You are now a breeder. You are a, I don't know, but you're a breeder.
[3449.61s -> 3462.57s]  Looking good. Looking good. All right. It's time to continue the plan. The plan is
[3463.29s -> 3471.30s]  the areas we're taking the city. What do I have for soldiers right now? We've got a good group
[3471.30s -> 3487.00s]  right here. This city doesn't have anything though. Do I build this place up? Look at all
[3487.00s -> 3496.34s]  this wood. I'm stealing it from here. I mean, this is a ton of wood. Just take it. These guys need
[3496.34s -> 3503.80s]  wood. Bad. There you go. Check it out. Actually, no, don't take it all. Take like, I mean like
[3503.80s -> 3511.98s]  five, three thousand back. Wait, are there other subs? There are other people subbed to other
[3511.98s -> 3517.45s]  channels other than mine. That's, hold on. I'm not processing what you're saying.
[3518.41s -> 3531.90s]  Is somebody, this other stream, wait, what the fuck are you saying? I'm just a little,
[3533.74s -> 3546.84s]  I'm just a little confused. That's all. Why is this not built? See if I can do this now.
[3552.71s -> 3556.55s]  It's time for you to go soldier mode. You don't need to gather anymore.
[3557.35s -> 3563.43s]  Let's get you leashed and let's get you into soldier activation mode. Eat that.
[3564.07s -> 3570.65s]  Get some food. Yep. Trust me. You're going to like it.
[3573.45s -> 3584.94s]  All right. It's time to take the city. This one. And then I got a good central location to feed
[3584.94s -> 3598.30s]  everybody. Bring up the soldiers. Murius is going in first. Murius is the base of attack operations.
[3598.30s -> 3609.59s]  These guys are here to take. Murius is going in first. Are you smelling the flowers?
[3615.37s -> 3631.66s]  He was not quite smelling the flowers. All right. We're in. Get up here and just hang out up here.
[3632.22s -> 3646.06s]  We're trying to bait a response. Murius, do your thing. Bait out a response. We're looking for
[3646.86s -> 3661.62s]  an attack. Nice. Oh, good. It worked. Very good. Very good. Murius. All right. Nice. You
[3661.62s -> 3672.28s]  kick down the fence. Go kick some ass. You ain't got nothing on fucking Murius. The Murius.
[3676.76s -> 3694.79s]  Now we're moving with the other troops. Ready to go. Oh, just take it. Where's the capture point?
[3694.79s -> 3712.25s]  Right there. New move. The mega stomp. I'm going to eat that villager. Do so. Do it. Wait, who are
[3712.25s -> 3724.60s]  you eating? Oh, you've reached into somebody's house. Oh my god. You just. All right. You just
[3724.60s -> 3739.08s]  did the original rampage arcade game. That was fucked up. Here comes another group. I'm ready.
[3739.08s -> 3752.65s]  Murius, how you doing? I need a heal. Let's get a heal. Heal. Do I have it yet? All right. Come on.
[3753.29s -> 3767.37s]  Let's take it so long. This would be a character. Yes. I'm surprised it wasn't like a cow character.
[3767.37s -> 3769.77s]  How do I not have this yet? Do I have no worshippers?
[3770.57s -> 3781.59s]  I'm going to destroy that storehouse. Didn't you just build it? All right. Murius here.
[3786.07s -> 3792.82s]  I think I don't need it. I think it's fine. Let's see. How you doing?
[3793.54s -> 3810.98s]  Make sure we get it. I don't care about anything else. He's just staring at it like he can't believe
[3810.98s -> 3825.85s]  it. Oh, did I just do that? Wow. That was kind of easy. All right. Now let's build this place
[3825.85s -> 3837.94s]  up now. Quick. We need to have this place ready to go. Defend this. Get a whole city here. Here
[3837.94s -> 3846.63s]  they come. Look. He's fucking. Look at him. Stay right here. Look at this shit. He thinks he's coming.
[3847.27s -> 3855.93s]  Let's get this shit built up. What do they have in this town? A lot of room too. All right. Let's
[3855.93s -> 3864.60s]  go. I want a temple right here. Right now. Temple. Altar. Let's go. No. Temple. No. Yeah. Altar. Yeah.
[3864.60s -> 3872.07s]  Right here. Let's do it. Who cares? Put it down. I want a creature pen right here. Get it down.
[3874.17s -> 3883.53s]  What? Why do I have water in my hand? Creature pen right here. Bingo. I want.
[3887.69s -> 3894.28s]  I want a temple. Do they have a temple? What's this thing? What's this? It's a tavern. All right. I
[3894.28s -> 3915.54s]  need a temple. Quickly. Get this shit going. All right. Murius. Listen to me. Very, very carefully.
[3915.54s -> 3932.31s]  Listen to me. We got to build this shit. Build your house. Oh no. The free will. It's okay.
[3942.58s -> 3957.91s]  Murius. What are you doing? Why is he going so far away? Murius. Oh, he's going to get wood.
[3958.87s -> 3963.27s]  In the time it took him to go get the wood. How much wood did he pick up? All right. He picked up
[3963.27s -> 3971.21s]  he picked up like five wood. That's not a whole lot, Murius. It's okay. You're trying. I'm going to
[3971.21s -> 3985.32s]  we're going to go free will after this. Do you have a link to my only fans? Uh, no. I don't have
[3985.32s -> 3992.57s]  one of those. Big boulder. Watch this shit. You guys want to see this? Get your fucking camera ready.
[4004.60s -> 4013.93s]  Go to sleep. Get some rest. I'll take care of the rest.

[13648.13s -> 13651.01s]  and unimportant I feel like when I try to do something I learn how to do it
[13651.01s -> 13654.89s]  slower and do it worse than most people I'm unambitious which has led me not to
[13654.89s -> 13657.89s]  pursue college a better job a significant other etc do you have any
[13657.89s -> 13666.10s]  advice other than watching you stream never a dull moment here thanks well
[13666.10s -> 13681.01s]  here's the thing depending on what you like to do it sounds like it sounds
[13681.01s -> 13685.84s]  like you might be you're not passionate about very many things correct me if I'm
[13685.84s -> 13693.17s]  wrong you kind of have to find something that you are very very passionate about
[13693.17s -> 13700.32s]  that you really really care about and then those things that you really care
[13700.32s -> 13705.48s]  about you you'll never feel that way because you really like it it's it
[13705.48s -> 13708.88s]  doesn't even have to be potentially for work or for a job if you really enjoy
[13708.88s -> 13714.96s]  something do it make yourself happy try to make yourself feel better make
[13714.96s -> 13727.63s]  yourself happy about something try to truly care about something because when
[13727.63s -> 13733.55s]  you start throwing darts that's when you can get into trouble you know oh I want
[13733.55s -> 13739.07s]  a significant other that's one thing to put time into I want a better job I want
[13739.11s -> 13744.03s]  to go to college I want I want all these things I want them I need them all right
[13744.03s -> 13758.96s]  you almost have to focus on one thing that you know you want to do and the
[13758.96s -> 13763.78s]  other things might come you talking about like significant other I I didn't
[13763.78s -> 13768.49s]  have a girlfriend or anything for like eight years it's great it kind of just
[13768.49s -> 13771.77s]  happened Kim and I just sort of happened I didn't even try I wasn't even trying
[13771.77s -> 13776.84s]  you just don't know what's gonna happen but all you can do is try to stay
[13776.84s -> 13788.68s]  passionate and try to care about something and try to do it there's no
[13788.72s -> 13798.75s]  real secret recipe I don't think that was a humble wait I just I just told you
[13798.75s -> 13804.25s]  I didn't have a girlfriend for like ten years how's it hey guys you know look at
[13804.25s -> 13808.71s]  me I haven't had a girlfriend in ten years until I came came along that's
[13808.71s -> 13816.37s]  how's that bragging that's just real life actually I want to take some of you
[13816.37s -> 13835.19s]  guys away you didn't have to try oh oh wait hold on people at the gate wait I
[13835.67s -> 13841.03s]  see you saying no I mean like I wasn't pursuing it it's sort of just happened
[13841.03s -> 13847.38s]  and I've tried you guys remember the tinder years I was on tinder I was on
[13847.38s -> 13851.90s]  dating websites trying to I got stood up on a fucking date from tinder I told
[13851.90s -> 13857.36s]  why we already went over that I was trying and the the moment that I just
[13857.36s -> 13862.32s]  stopped trying for some reason it was like okay a few months later I just met
[13862.32s -> 13870.73s]  this person like a Christmas party and it's not like I gave up on tinder or
[13870.73s -> 13874.05s]  anything like that it was just I it wasn't a priority for me anymore
[13874.05s -> 13888.40s]  tinder is garbage yet tinder is is 75% bots 10% people making accounts just to
[13888.40s -> 13893.86s]  see what happens like they did not oh I'm just gonna make a tinder I match
[13893.86s -> 13897.94s]  with this person well all right cool that's how many matches did I have today
[13897.94s -> 13917.00s]  that's it and like 4% people that want to like go on dates more like 1% it's a
[13917.00s -> 13922.61s]  hookup app no it's a place to get bought phone numbers to data mine your
[13922.61s -> 13935.61s]  fucking cell phone but to put a cap on that I should probably game actually
[13935.61s -> 13943.12s]  because a lot of time just went by to put a cap on that it's hard to it's hard
[13943.12s -> 13946.00s]  to give advice on stuff like this because I don't really know the answers
[13946.00s -> 13952.99s]  I don't really have them I wish it did all I can tell you is
[13952.99s -> 13960.72s]  experiences that I've had and some of them are fairly fucking strange I wish I
[13960.76s -> 13965.86s]  had a way to answer
[13967.78s -> 13972.56s]  wait Jeremy you're not an internet psychologist
[13973.00s -> 13976.72s]  but I feel like I have some experiences that could maybe help people or try to
[13976.72s -> 13984.12s]  tell them how I did things but I did things really strange
[13988.14s -> 14004.32s]  did you try Bumble no I was I was out of the game by the time Bumble was like

[22245.72s -> 22260.08s]  a test run test run like the movie about the blue animal when they released the
[22260.08s -> 22264.08s]  first trailer and people weren't happy with it it was sort of a test but the
[22264.08s -> 22270.86s]  future and then they ended up changing it into the what the character is now
[22270.86s -> 22286.44s]  it's then progressed into from what I've heard one of the what is it s comment

[28492.70s -> 28506.58s]  so slightly stretched like this it looks it looked I looked strange okay that was
[28506.86s -> 28528.80s]  something about that was fucking strange right it was like this I let's complete
[28528.80s -> 28533.64s]  this in uh I'm gonna be going to bed well not bad actually I need to get food
[28533.64s -> 28542.36s]  need to eat something we'll call it pretty much exactly at eight hours
[28542.36s -> 28548.12s]  McDonald's no no McDonald's none of that um all right I got forty thousand
[28548.12s -> 28553.84s]  favor right what what happened wait wait wait wait what happened here I wasn't
[28553.84s -> 28559.28s]  paying any and I mean a single fucking piece of attention is another one I
[28559.28s -> 28576.96s]  didn't even hear what they said what was the clue find the point between tasks
[28576.96s -> 28597.93s]  past hmm a difficult riddle point between tasks past point between tasks
[28597.93s -> 28635.57s]  past bad on purpose what what's going on we talking about between tasks past it's
[28635.57s -> 28642.26s]  like in here somewhere point between tasks past wouldn't be in the middle
[28642.26s -> 28660.28s]  of all these geometry he's actually pretending sad face I don't I wouldn't I
[28660.28s -> 28680.33s]  wouldn't even look at it anything how is this the middle didn't I already tried
[28680.33s -> 28685.83s]  this in this clearing he's the guy I already did it in here but he's actually
[28685.83s -> 28695.90s]  pretending just tell me where it is I don't I I could give a shit less about
[28695.90s -> 28721.82s]  what I'm doing right now triangle what it's the green patch on the hill this
[28721.82s -> 28764.52s]  point between tasks past that doesn't help me middle of a triangle turn on
[28764.52s -> 28775.44s]  click maps I can't cuz I can't all tab the game these are the tasks right here
[28775.44s -> 28784.65s]  in the middle point between tasks past wouldn't that be like right here or like
[28784.65s -> 28801.16s]  here I don't understand I'm just as confused as he is that's the logic I
[28801.16s -> 28808.50s]  think well it can't be serious no you're not serious because you don't know where
[28808.50s -> 28859.38s]  the fuck it is either so where is it on the patch rocks I did it here like
[28859.38s -> 28900.01s]  fucking ten times why won't it do it I did it here like already a bunch of
[28900.01s -> 28906.37s]  time it shows me the way to the ruin follow me I actually did it there like
[28906.37s -> 28918.68s]  at least three four times here we are the ruins must be beneath these huge
[28918.68s -> 28925.36s]  rocks oh we would need the strength of the gods to move these who will never
[28925.36s -> 28930.12s]  get to examine the roof fuckers wanted me to go up to the mountain all right so
[28930.12s -> 28972.52s]  I wonder if anyone will give it a rest ruins okay why do you I go in I cleared
[28972.56s -> 29001.20s]  it for you go take a look smooth them throw the rocks into the water fuck you
[29001.20s -> 29017.92s]  can't just walk in here it's the funniest movie of the year Sonic the
[29018.92s -> 29040.20s]  I thought I was getting hacked I thought I was getting hacked dude what the fuck
[29040.20s -> 29046.56s]  just happened like an ad just started playing fuck I must have downloaded
[29046.56s -> 29056.91s]  something weird holy shit this is too many people we um I don't think we can
[29056.91s -> 29073.57s]  take this many people how many this is like six million people it's a thousand
[29073.57s -> 29104.34s]  people I don't even have a thousand people my whole town all right there's
[29104.34s -> 29119.65s]  so many you look like Nickelodeon floam for God's sakes there's so many people
[29119.65s -> 29127.50s]  there it just looks like floam it didn't happen you didn't see it you did I'm
[29127.50s -> 29163.53s]  going back okay I don't want to see that it's too much it's too much for my brain

[29220.00s -> 29224.12s]  hard at anything but I've just said it's been a constant stream of comedy and
[29224.28s -> 29230.49s]  humor for me like it's been almost seven straight hours of me just laughing oh
[29230.49s -> 29243.47s]  all right come on in everybody in successful penis stream why don't I
[29243.47s -> 29258.41s]  just read that so many people let's at least go see the next cutscene
[29258.41s -> 29279.32s]  Murius be nice Murius be nice he's shaking his head he's like no no no no
[29279.32s -> 29293.36s]  too many people they're having a food all right we're there they're in let's
[29293.36s -> 29296.48s]  check out the next area and then I'm going to bed and I gotta get out here

[29323.40s -> 29326.28s]  Tuesday Wednesday something like that but I really wanted to see this part
[29326.28s -> 29334.51s]  because this is uh this is important no towns taken by force the whole night
[29334.51s -> 29343.78s]  well actually that's a lie I beat the last level to 9% evil I didn't do
[29343.78s -> 29353.66s]  anything impressiveness yeah happiness was pretty good population the highest
[29353.66s -> 29369.86s]  population was 1234 which is because I got 778 people what happened here 1100
[29369.86s -> 29381.10s]  male population a hundred and forty three female is that why we're having
[29381.10s -> 29392.77s]  so many props that I just get really bad RNG or something that's weird that's
[29392.77s -> 29402.78s]  number of enemy soldiers killed five hundred and fifty five I wonder how
[29402.78s -> 29414.36s]  many of those are Murius 17 hundred and fifty eight deaths 58 water miracles six
[29414.36s -> 29421.20s]  only six fireballs that's pretty good I did most of the no I didn't do any of
[29421.24s -> 29434.49s]  these didn't not oil are here's the good one 70% good 70% good he's 12 he's 11
[29434.49s -> 29449.18s]  feet tall he's now 8,000 pounds he's at 92% muscle 75% fit mmm hundred hit
[29449.74s -> 29480.26s]  146 bowel movements he killed 800 people that's though in the whole land he was
[29480.26s -> 29486.78s]  responsible for killing half of every single living person on in this whole
[29486.78s -> 29495.16s]  country over the course of what I assume is like three or four years he killed
[29495.16s -> 29513.59s]  half the population himself Jesus good job my head take a look at this next
[29513.59s -> 29524.13s]  cutscene as we ready ourselves we will let the Greeks prepare for our storm to
[29524.13s -> 29533.45s]  come you are right they have divine help but the prophecy says they will rise
[29533.45s -> 29541.07s]  against those who nearly destroyed them the Aztecs if they can triumph over us
[29541.07s -> 29548.30s]  we will have no option but to offer ourselves to their side you speak sense
[29548.30s -> 29554.02s]  brother we have both seen what these Greeks can do but we must make us turn
[29554.02s -> 29562.17s]  here first finally this is a tiger that I humiliated three times I'm sick that
[29563.13s -> 29568.97s]  but the second brother isn't a city builder he prefers destruction you
[29568.97s -> 29575.25s]  should be where beware him he can kiss my shiny right behind this level is
[29575.25s -> 29582.57s]  huge let's build us some armies and get cracking on those nasty miracles this is
[29582.57s -> 29588.21s]  gonna be it is imperative we protect ourselves with walls the Japanese won't
[29588.25s -> 29598.76s]  wait for you to make your move they will be desperate to drive us out and that's
[29598.76s -> 29606.16s]  where we're gonna close it for tonight I do want to take a look at the map this
[29606.16s -> 29615.52s]  is a big boy not really actually it's just too big stronghold soon no one
[29615.52s -> 29627.31s]  shall be able to save it here I'm gonna call this one not two fronts exist the
[29627.31s -> 29634.01s]  beauty of my city classic RTS map yeah and there's one in the middle that's a
[29634.05s -> 29639.90s]  big point of interest this one I wish this is the one we just played this one
[29639.90s -> 29647.40s]  looks fun but that's gonna be it for today I will see you guys later see you
[29647.40s -> 29655.67s]  guys on Monday we are not going to come back to black and white to on Monday
[29655.67s -> 29672.26s]  we're gonna change games get a good look at Murius beautiful beautiful it's still
[29672.26s -> 29686.47s]  quite itchy Murius we're going to do on Monday chibi robo I have it it's ready
[29686.47s -> 29706.54s]  to go should be a lot of fun pet Murius after chibi robo is done we will see if
[29706.54s -> 29709.70s]  I want to come back and finish this because I believe this I think there's
[29709.70s -> 29717.72s]  only one or two maps left in the whole game there's also the expansion which I
[29717.72s -> 29725.81s]  do own as well so I'm assuming I could probably do another stream on this and
[29725.81s -> 29733.06s]  finish the base game at least we'll see I'm not gonna be doing that next week
[29733.26s -> 29737.58s]  we're gonna have to put the cap on this for a little while but it is available
[29737.58s -> 29746.70s]  the black and white two is now just available and the expansion mentions
[29746.70s -> 29760.44s]  like five big levels cool available in quotes no but I love this game so I'm
[29760.44s -> 29762.88s]  having so much fun it's definitely something I want to play again on
[29762.88s -> 29772.56s]  stream at the cow before I do okay I'll pet cow before I turn it on hey you hey
[29772.56s -> 29801.02s]  come here you're hiding watch out goodbye Murius we'll see you again soon
[29801.02s -> 29812.65s]  and that goes for you guys as well we'll see you again on Monday it is saved
[29812.65s -> 29836.80s]  there Murius for rumble Murius for own TV show I'll see you guys later I'm gonna
[29836.80s -> 29854.97s]  get some food I'm hungry Murius replace bugleberry let me just load up the make
[29854.97s -> 29864.89s]  sure I have the bits in the right spot I should I do okay let's go back earlier
[29864.89s -> 29872.02s]  today we had two dollars and 80 cents from for real dough 280 bits now you've
[29872.02s -> 29876.69s]  been enjoying black and white any chance you'll reconsider dungeon keeper maybe
[29876.69s -> 29884.74s]  but I think the reason why I like black and white so much is because there's so
[29884.74s -> 29889.78s]  much to look at at any given moment having the creature just do shit and run
[29889.78s -> 29894.95s]  around and I can just laugh at the things that the cow is doing takes me
[29894.95s -> 29899.87s]  away from the actual video game of city building and that's why I can stay
[29899.87s -> 29909.92s]  interested dungeon keeper is it's an interesting game but I think it's more
[29909.92s -> 29916.32s]  so I would probably lose interest in it after a stream and that's correct me if
[29916.32s -> 29923.62s]  I'm wrong but that's a pretty long experience isn't it isn't dungeon
[29923.62s -> 29934.43s]  keeper more than like a 30 plus hour game potentially just look at Chad
[29934.43s -> 29941.03s]  instead it is well not that long but the bit yeah and I always have trouble
[29941.03s -> 29947.00s]  finishing games on stream anyways that I don't know and look I'm speaking
[29947.00s -> 29952.04s]  completely kind of out of my ass here because I've only played dungeon keeper
[29952.04s -> 29961.38s]  for maybe 30 minutes total more than 15 years ago I just don't I didn't grab me
[29961.38s -> 29966.72s]  when I was younger this did I remember what I'm ever being 15 years old playing
[29966.72s -> 29978.32s]  black and white one 14 something like that whatever how old I was I also
[29978.32s -> 29982.51s]  don't like to completely say I'm never gonna do something because sometimes it
[29982.51s -> 29995.66s]  just happens so I don't know I'll have to look into it but thank you for the 280
[29995.66s -> 30001.16s]  though thank you raddest raccoon for the 250 I need to know if you're gonna
[30001.16s -> 30004.32s]  replace the wink with something else do I sell my wing points or do I save them
[30004.32s -> 30010.20s]  for something better there's gonna be a couple things on the new channel points
[30010.20s -> 30017.70s]  you'll see you do what you want with your own currency though whatever you
[30017.70s -> 30023.96s]  want to do with it it's your call it's your idea I'm gonna be adding other
[30023.96s -> 30032.04s]  stuff though that's hopefully interesting dark soul thanks for the 250
[30032.04s -> 30036.53s]  dark soul hi I'm here from goop gaming really excited to reach out to you our

[30224.41s -> 30228.17s]  play whenever someone redeems it no one has to know people will know immediately
[30228.17s -> 30233.61s]  something that twitch chat and the internet kind of culture in general can
[30233.61s -> 30245.11s]  do is sniff out bullshit instantly instantly it would take one or two times
[30245.11s -> 30258.86s]  before it was cat was out of the bag you know I mean thank you uh jump T thanks
[30258.86s -> 30261.26s]  for 300 bits love the stream do you think you'll be playing the new Animal

[30273.66s -> 30279.12s]  sitting there in the corner not turned on ever it's kind of turning into the
[30279.12s -> 30286.48s]  way that my Xbox one was but I haven't really turned on my ps4 either I need a
[30286.48s -> 30295.12s]  reason to play something we are getting close to the end of the console cycles
[30295.12s -> 30303.03s]  or at least Xbox and ps4 ps5 is coming out this year it's so is it's so weird
[30303.07s -> 30317.70s]  it's so strange that the ps5 is gonna come out this year holiday this year you
[30317.70s -> 30322.48s]  think they'll delay it been like seven years for this console cycle yeah but
[30322.48s -> 30326.45s]  for some reason it feels like it hasn't been this has been an incredibly long
[30326.45s -> 30331.73s]  cycle going into eight years after right it's doesn't feel like it's only been
[30331.73s -> 30335.81s]  out for like three years four years feel like it hasn't been out for that long
[30341.71s -> 30346.64s]  subway rat princess thanks for 300 bits three dollars thank you
[30346.64s -> 30354.96s]  Esquilo thanks for the 250 hey jerk ma 985 a sandwich is defined as a
[30354.96s -> 30359.04s]  carbohydrate product or other containing edible structure of reasonable
[30359.04s -> 30363.04s]  structural fortitude utilizes a vehicle for ingredients to reach the mouth with
[30363.04s -> 30368.48s]  excessive dirtying or greasing of the hands a sandwich must have portability
[30368.48s -> 30372.24s]  and relative tidiness its main function is to guide the ingredients to the mouth
[30372.24s -> 30376.96s]  without the use of utensils thus a pizza is a sandwich hot dog is a sandwich a
[30376.96s -> 30389.08s]  taco is a sandwich no they're not pizza is a pizza it's not a pizza sandwich a
[30389.08s -> 30395.36s]  hot dog is a hot dog it's in a bun it's a it's not a hot dog sandwich taco is a
[30395.36s -> 30410.92s]  taco it's not a taco sandwich and by the way we have pizza is a pie and what's
[30410.92s -> 30420.27s]  an open-faced sandwich a sandwich that's not completed it's is not a pie it's a
[30420.87s -> 30432.72s]  we talked about this in the discord for like 40 minutes no no no a sandwich was
[30432.72s -> 30441.88s]  created by some some dude modern concept of a sandwich using slices of bread as
[30441.88s -> 30458.18s]  found within the West can arguably trace to 18th century Europe John sandwich the
[30458.18s -> 30462.86s]  use of some kind of bread or bread like substance to lie under and over some
[30462.86s -> 30467.58s]  other food or used to scoop up and enclose or wrap some other type of food
[30468.06s -> 30473.76s]  so we talk about a complete closure here is a sandwich hot dog does not have a
[30473.76s -> 30478.24s]  complete closure pizza does not have complete closure taco does not have
[30478.24s -> 30486.72s]  complete closure a sandwich is a complete closure and you could also say

[30551.30s -> 30557.84s]  describe bread and stuff in the middle you know that's not like I guess
[30557.84s -> 30561.16s]  technically you could be like well a hot dogs the same yeah but I mean like
[30561.16s -> 30565.62s]  that's everybody just knows that a sandwich is just bread and stuff in the
[30565.62s -> 30569.92s]  middle eyes are sandwiches no they're not what how is a pie a sandwich it's

[30858.04s -> 30861.68s]  making new friends I recently pushed myself to do a few new activities to
[30861.68s -> 30866.16s]  meet new people sometimes feel like I'm just too awkward or slow for people to
[30866.16s -> 30870.60s]  slow to for people to enjoy my company that's very discouraging thanks for the
[30870.60s -> 30879.05s]  laughs and to be honest ASMR like voice please fart on the face cam alright you
[30879.05s -> 30883.01s]  look at you looking for advice and then you end it with like please fart on face
[30883.01s -> 30893.08s]  cam you've thrown me off alright making new friends the best place to make new
[30893.08s -> 30897.20s]  friends and you've said you've recently pushed us up to do a few new activities
[30897.20s -> 30907.17s]  to meet people you kind of need to do something you already like and that you
[30907.17s -> 30912.46s]  know that has people around that also like those things doing something that's
[30912.66s -> 30920.04s]  new it's much easier to it's much easier to do new activity with friends and make
[30920.04s -> 30926.02s]  new friends at new activity and it is to go to new activity and make all brand
[30926.02s -> 30933.04s]  new friends by yourself going in groups is much easier for something brand new
[30933.04s -> 30943.23s]  I'm getting question marks for this what a new activity except if you something
[30943.23s -> 30952.80s]  well why am I getting question mark for this did I not say that correctly doing
[30952.80s -> 30955.92s]  stuff in groups that you've all of you never done before it's much easier for
[30956.00s -> 30958.88s]  you to bounce off each other and meet new people and hang out with people
[30958.88s -> 30966.26s]  because it's not just you that has to talk to new people that makes sense
[30966.26s -> 30977.36s]  right yeah I'm getting question mark yeah spend money to make money I get it I
[30977.36s -> 30986.50s]  get it you just went full I was pretty articulate all right anyways solo
[30986.50s -> 30994.05s]  activities it's harder to kind of assimilate yourself into a group but the
[30994.05s -> 30998.97s]  internet has done so many things to create places for you to hang out and
[30998.97s -> 31013.26s]  spend time and kind of make friends so you got a fart or what into the webcam I
[31013.26s -> 31023.16s]  don't know if I can do it into the webcam into the into the web I didn't
[31023.16s -> 31028.06s]  have the webcam that just came out I didn't have the webcam on I you can't
[31028.06s -> 31039.95s]  time these things guys Jesus Christ sorry there was still some there there's
[31039.95s -> 31047.16s]  still some in there you can't just let it sit in the chamber it's got to go what
[31047.20s -> 31056.31s]  was going on oh yeah making friends I made a lot of friends on YouTube because
[31056.31s -> 31063.00s]  people were just we were doing the same thing you need to find something you
[31063.00s -> 31068.00s]  really like that you can do solo that also has other people that are doing it
[31068.00s -> 31072.88s]  solo at the same time if you really have trouble making friends tuber friends oh
[31072.88s -> 31083.82s]  yeah tuber friend term it's 1 a.m. please I'm going you got to go to bed

[31157.24s -> 31167.08s]  did that more than once oh it would be bad it would be people would be they
[31167.08s -> 31174.00s]  would be minus two is it be like stop stop dude what the fuck this is not this

[32944.27s -> 32948.59s]  not as far as you went that's still pretty far though still that's still far
[32948.59s -> 32951.95s]  but very far I guess the main differences with me is that I'm single
[32951.95s -> 32955.19s]  and I'm also an only child I really don't like it here not because the
[32955.19s -> 32958.11s]  people of politics or anything but it's like it might be difficult to live so
[32958.11s -> 32969.73s]  far from my family thanks German um yeah I was fortunate enough to have my
[32969.73s -> 32977.50s]  girlfriend who was just was gonna follow me anywhere and continued will we're
[32977.50s -> 32983.82s]  going to continue to also had a buddy Alex he's right over there that also was
[32983.82s -> 32988.34s]  wanted to check it out and do it for a little while and it's much easier with
[32988.34s -> 33005.27s]  other people it really is but with that being said how do I do it a lot of
[33005.27s -> 33009.87s]  people have come up here and again this is another thing of how I'm pretty
[33009.87s -> 33015.35s]  fortunate with this too is I mean I live in Las Vegas and that's a destination
[33015.35s -> 33019.15s]  people are like yeah I got a trip to Vegas in two months I'm like okay I live
[33019.15s -> 33025.79s]  here oh yeah great I'll see you a lot of people come up here but Utah Utah's
[33025.79s -> 33030.55s]  actually a pretty great state from what I hear you people will come to you is
[33030.55s -> 33033.55s]  what I'm saying especially with some of the cool shit that you could find and
[33033.55s -> 33046.35s]  entice people to come up is it yeah Utah Utah supposed to be pretty good what's
[33046.35s -> 33062.57s]  wrong with Utah now what do you mean doubt the Grand Canyon is in Utah that's
[33062.61s -> 33068.09s]  kind of in that's that's one of the most biggest marvels of our entire fucking
[33068.09s -> 33102.54s]  world doesn't Grand Canyon doesn't pass through Utah I thought it did I thought
[33102.54s -> 33112.95s]  it passed through Utah it doesn't I thought it did I thought it hit the I
[33112.95s -> 33118.01s]  thought it hit like the bottom like like the self I thought it hit like the
[33118.01s -> 33129.83s]  self fucking the southern point of the state it doesn't know it's only in
[33130.43s -> 33146.45s]  what about those salt lakes those salt lakes are pretty sick salt Lake City
[33146.45s -> 33153.16s]  it's a great fucking place from what I've heard look I'm gonna fix this I'm
[33153.16s -> 33161.34s]  gonna fucking enlighten some of you guys Utah is actually pretty high up in like
[33161.34s -> 33168.18s]  the in this in the rankings of states rankings Utah numbness is not bullshit
[33168.18s -> 33175.83s]  take a look I want you to see this Utah is in the top ten in health care top
[33175.87s -> 33181.19s]  ten in education top the second strongest economy the third best
[33181.19s -> 33187.22s]  infrastructure in the entire country the one of the most fiscally stable and
[33187.22s -> 33200.65s]  one of the safest states in the country okay that's real data that is pretty
[33200.65s -> 33218.95s]  low if that is like 38 sounds stupid why don't you just move to rank one just
[33218.95s -> 33224.38s]  move back I want to go to rank well what is Nevada that is 37 Nevada has two
[33224.38s -> 33228.46s]  things that are going for it it's top ten economy and top five in
[33228.46s -> 33236.58s]  infrastructure and this is based off of you can pull up each one that's this is
[33236.58s -> 33240.78s]  actually a really really interesting website because I sat here for like a
[33240.78s -> 33246.52s]  couple hours picking out individual states and being like why is that why
[33246.52s -> 33258.05s]  wait no education how why Massachusetts is number eight to explain
[33258.05s -> 33266.70s]  infrastructure roads bridges buildings infrastructure like the actual big
[33266.82s -> 33278.35s]  hella way number one Florida is the best state in the world what state has the
[33278.35s -> 33280.79s]  best health care Hawaii and Massachusetts massive mean that that's a
[33280.79s -> 33285.71s]  no-brainer Massachusetts is some of the best
[33285.71s -> 33293.61s]  hospitals on earth so I mean it makes sense Hawaii though Massachusetts
[33293.61s -> 33300.16s]  number one in education Colorado number one for economy Oregon number one in
[33300.16s -> 33303.80s]  infrastructure New Hampshire and number one an opportunity I actually was gonna
[33303.80s -> 33308.80s]  move to New Hampshire it was one of the places I wanted to go to fiscal
[33308.80s -> 33316.72s]  stability Tennessee Tennessee New Hampshire is also the safest state in
[33316.72s -> 33322.36s]  the country and Rhode Island has the best natural environment which is air
[33322.36s -> 33339.20s]  quality water quality etc it's getting expensive yeah Rhode Island is Rhode
[33339.20s -> 33343.16s]  Island is actually at the almost at the very bottom for infrastructure which
[33343.16s -> 33347.68s]  means the roads are dogshit like the power lines are all in disarray
[33347.84s -> 33355.80s]  bridges are fucking falling apart but it's got some of the cleanest air it has
[33355.80s -> 33361.96s]  the cleanest air and cleanest water in America and top five in health care so
