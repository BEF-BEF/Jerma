[1.72s -> 10.81s]  Hey everybody. We're gonna try a test. We're gonna try to do it again. Who knows if this
[10.81s -> 13.93s]  is gonna be functional or not, but I am, you know, I'm willing to give it a try.
[16.02s -> 25.19s]  All you can do is try. You guys having a good day? What is today? I've lost all track of time
[25.19s -> 37.53s]  has been deleted. What is today? Thursday, November 1st. He's, he's, there he is. He's
[38.33s -> 48.50s]  Well, it never really went anywhere, but we've, we've had some solid green
[49.22s -> 56.90s]  over the last 24 hours. So I figured I would try because we've been dealing with, obviously
[56.90s -> 63.54s]  Cox has been trying to get infrastructurally these problems fixed. And this is the first
[63.54s -> 67.30s]  time in probably two and a half weeks where we've had internet for more than like four
[67.30s -> 73.30s]  hours straight. So we're green for the moment. Let's see how, this could be 45 minutes or this
[73.30s -> 79.90s]  could be six hours. I don't know. I'm willing to give it an attempt though. And well,
[79.90s -> 86.14s]  we will update some information about the green screen stream. So you're gonna have to
[86.14s -> 94.26s]  stick around for that. There's some updated info. Here comes a 30 minute stream. All right,
[94.26s -> 132.06s]  give me, give me one second. Also funnily enough, there was, I turned on the PS4
[132.70s -> 137.26s]  because this is where I was Red Dead 2. And I don't know. I think the, the PS4 must
[137.26s -> 144.70s]  have gone into rest mode because we're at the same screen I was at like four and a half
[144.70s -> 153.42s]  days ago. So we're just here. I don't really remember what I was doing, but I know that I
[153.42s -> 164.87s]  exist here. I got to remember the controls too. This is gonna be fucking hard. Even the game was
[164.87s -> 173.34s]  waiting. Yeah. It's like nothing ever happened. You guys just woke up. We all just woke up.
[174.23s -> 182.55s]  And we're here four days later. We got 50, 50 bucks right off the bat from Pocket Pauling.
[182.55s -> 186.79s]  Thanks for the $50 Pocket Pauling. Finally, my dad is back from the war. Hey, Jerma,
[186.79s -> 192.55s]  how sad, relieved are you that you missed the Red Sox parade? Oh yeah, the Red Sox won
[192.55s -> 200.87s]  the World Series. That's right. That happened. What else has happened in the time that I haven't
[200.87s -> 209.34s]  been awake? I mean streaming, you know, Red Sox won the World Series. Super Smash Brothers
[210.22s -> 219.00s]  is coming out and they did a direct today. And excuse me. Excuse me. Where's my favorite
[219.00s -> 230.07s]  fucking character? Excuse me. Plant? Oh, I thought you guys were calling me a plant.
[230.71s -> 239.27s]  Well, I don't want to give any spoilers for people that haven't watched the direct,
[240.62s -> 250.63s]  but I'm missing somebody real important there, I think. Jerma's a plant. That's right. I'm
[250.63s -> 265.62s]  working. I'm working for him. Minecraft Steve. No, no way. What do you mean I wouldn't let
[265.62s -> 270.52s]  that happen? I don't work for Nintendo. No, I would never let that happen. This is not like
[270.52s -> 275.82s]  me playing Red Dead right now. What am I talking about? I would like I would talk to somebody.
[276.54s -> 286.33s]  Oh my fucking Jesus. Hold on. Thank you. Thank you. Jabba dab for your 10 community sub.
[287.05s -> 292.04s]  Thanks a lot, man. Thanks. Also, by the way, pocket Pauling. We didn't really touch upon your
[292.04s -> 298.38s]  $50 here. Like for real, thank you so much. Pocket Pauling for your 50 bucks and jabba
[298.38s -> 305.48s]  dab for your 10 community subs. And I think we I think we can go. You know what I'm
[305.48s -> 311.62s]  saying? I think we can just go. I got it. How do you ride the horse? I forget. Here we go.
[312.18s -> 321.67s]  What was I doing? Okay, I'm back in it. Is it x? I forget how to play. Do you just I just
[321.67s -> 331.02s]  woke up from a fucking dream. Okay, stalling. I don't remember how to shoot. I was in the
[331.02s -> 337.74s]  middle of the tutorial and I went into cryogenic sleep to get the train. You want to
[337.74s -> 343.83s]  head down? See how he's getting on? Okay. No, I remember. Okay, but I'm getting some
[343.91s -> 356.42s]  memories. Check on Bill. That's a gun. Okay. How do I take out the
[361.99s -> 366.39s]  doctor binocular? What was benign? Was there a binocular button? Do I do I go? Am I going
[366.39s -> 379.94s]  down? You know, I have to leave. I'm holding a knife. L one and R one. There we go. Okay.
[382.78s -> 401.99s]  Let's check on Bill. How's he doing? All right, put him up. Get on the horse.
[401.99s -> 405.75s]  This is I didn't even get to fucking do this. It's been four and a half days.
[406.23s -> 423.59s]  No, god damn it. Okay, zoom. Where are you, Bill? This is this what I'm supposed to be doing.
[432.28s -> 436.36s]  Guys, give me a break. There he is. Okay. Where's he on the hill?
[440.28s -> 450.87s]  Okay, there he is. All right, spotted. I gotta I gotta move my horse out of here.
[451.11s -> 457.19s]  Set up the detonator by those rocks over there. Okay, sure. Now just unspool the wire and then
[457.19s -> 463.75s]  attach it to said detonator. I'm going to explode here. Pick up the spool.
[468.54s -> 474.81s]  I'm gonna I'm gonna like acme this guy. You're about to get wily coyote.
[475.61s -> 492.28s]  How much slack do we have? All right, here we go. Attach it.
[494.15s -> 508.49s]  This is attach the thing mini game or what? Okay. Okay. All right. Now stomp on detonator.
[516.47s -> 523.56s]  What if I just jump on this? Imagine if it just fucking blew up.
[526.47s -> 532.98s]  All right, I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Put the horse on the tracks. I just got this
[532.98s -> 544.73s]  horse. Why would I do something like that? I just bought the horse. All right, so I
[544.73s -> 549.69s]  have to detonate it. So I blow up the train. He says all fine. We'll soon find out.
[551.29s -> 558.01s]  Put yourself on the tracks. I think so. Okay, cover your faces. Train should be here any
[558.01s -> 574.47s]  minute now. Weapon wheel. So now we're looking for the detonator. The light.
[584.04s -> 588.42s]  I thought I had to like throw the fuse. It's not radio controlled.
[589.38s -> 599.32s]  Gentlemen, it's time. Good luck. All of you. You all know what to do.
[600.12s -> 604.28s]  I don't know. I actually don't because I saw the first part of this mission and story
[605.08s -> 613.62s]  almost four and a half, five days ago. Here we go. All right, that just didn't work.
[622.38s -> 626.79s]  Why are we getting off the horses? Wait, why would we get off the horse?
[628.87s -> 631.51s]  Jump on the train. How am I supposed to do that from here?
[638.78s -> 655.74s]  Okay, I've made it. Oh, running a train. All right, give me a Lenin. Pull, pull him.
[660.54s -> 662.78s]  Wait, oh, did he fall or did I fall?
[667.58s -> 676.06s]  Come on, this is what it's supposed to be doing, right? What? What am I doing?
[679.53s -> 692.23s]  Okay, I think I figured out what I'm supposed to do. What's the uh, okay.
[694.07s -> 699.94s]  All right, let's go. Stop the train. It's not TNT barrels here, right?
[707.26s -> 722.89s]  I like the repeater. I was going for a tackle. All right, quick. I got to need something.
[723.45s -> 732.12s]  Give me some cover. Wait, wait, no, we gotta go. What the fuck?
[734.15s -> 737.26s]  I just got hit in the face with a shovel. Reverse the grapple.
[737.98s -> 754.57s]  Is this Abe Lincoln? All right, give it the front of the engine car.
[764.01s -> 782.52s]  There's more. Right in the face. I have dead eye, so I don't know why I'm not using it
[783.24s -> 786.22s]  for some reason. What's the reload button?
[792.44s -> 797.42s]  Can I get like an ammo toss to me? That's it, right?
[798.06s -> 811.22s]  That guy. I need to pick up stuff on the ground. Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[812.50s -> 827.53s]  Is that a person in the back? Is that an animal? That's a person. Oh shit. Oh shit. Get behind
[827.53s -> 836.33s]  this little fucking slab. Wait, this is our guys? Oh, these are our guys. All right. Wait,
[836.33s -> 847.11s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need to. It's a rock. It's a slab. That's a slab. Okay.
[854.33s -> 857.61s]  Assume yellow tonic to fortify your bars. A fortified bar can be used for a short period
[857.61s -> 863.29s]  without draining. This tonic will fortify your dead eye. Listen to me. Okay. We don't want to
[863.29s -> 874.89s]  kill any of you. Any more of you. I give you my word, but trust me, we will. Boys,
[875.85s -> 888.25s]  okay. You asked for it. Five, three, two, one. Seems our friends have gone deaf.
[888.25s -> 891.93s]  I don't, I don't know what the, what the world war two plane sound was coming from outside.
[892.65s -> 906.49s]  Are we going? I can't rapid fire this time. Mr. Williamson, give Mr. Morgan and Mr. Smith
[906.49s -> 912.54s]  some dynamite. You two boys go blow that door open. Why don't we do that? Thanks bill.
[913.42s -> 920.68s]  Much to us, but you boys in there might want to take a step back.
[921.24s -> 926.20s]  Place dynamite. Seems good enough. All right. Here we go. Like the views. Here we go.
[926.20s -> 939.42s]  All right. Now step back. Unless you got a death wish. I'd step back, fellas. Yeah,
[939.42s -> 945.59s]  I did this. I did this. All right. Now go in and just start firing.
[954.57s -> 967.50s]  Blind him. Get on up and search that train. What's the punch button? I want to punch. It's
[967.50s -> 977.99s]  all right. Let's search the damn train. Look at this place. It's like a, it's beautiful in here.
[978.87s -> 983.75s]  You two got the safe. I'll search the rest. Oh yes. Should be easy as cake.
[986.31s -> 988.95s]  If I'm going to hide something, I would hide it inside the lamp.
[989.67s -> 995.59s]  Shut up. Me and Arthur did all the work. Yeah, kid did good. Didn't see you rushing to jump on
[995.59s -> 999.51s]  that train. He's king. I'll give you that. On receipt of funds, we proceed with phases two
[999.51s -> 1002.07s]  and three of the project and present you with a detailed report of our findings within
[1002.07s -> 1007.43s]  the month. Yours, respectively. Okay, let's see if we can get this open. Now that wasn't part
[1007.43s -> 1017.53s]  of it. Getting there. What's in there? Cigars? I can't carry any more of this item. I need
[1017.53s -> 1033.32s]  to sell some shit then. Any codes? No, no codes. You can screenshot that and read it later if you
[1033.32s -> 1040.01s]  want. All right, there's brandy. I'm going to need to do something eventually here, food wise.
[1042.97s -> 1048.65s]  Can't carry any more of this item. Why not?
[1049.93s -> 1067.43s]  Can somebody else hold something? Money? That's money. Those are IOUs. No, it tells you. Bond.
[1076.57s -> 1080.68s]  Is it really a lockbox if it's unlocked? That's true.
[1080.68s -> 1088.65s]  What did you find? These. They worth anything? Oh, sure. Bearer bonds. I think we could probably
[1088.65s -> 1092.97s]  sell these pretty easily. Oh, wait, is that Ethereum? Well done. Now would you get rid of
[1092.97s -> 1098.65s]  all of this? The train? Yeah, get it out of here. What about them? What do you think?
[1098.65s -> 1103.98s]  I don't know. It's up to you. Kill them, leave them here. Take them with you on the
[1103.98s -> 1110.46s]  train. Wait, I get temporary party members? Okay. See you back at camp. What do I do
[1110.46s -> 1117.86s]  about these three? We'll be moving on. The rest are you. Let's ride. What do I do with my temporary
[1117.86s -> 1131.06s]  party? Guard. Deal with the guards. Can I pick who I threaten? Okay. Get on the train. Quick.
[1138.82s -> 1154.60s]  Wait, I gotta get you too. Oh, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's going on? What happened?
[1154.60s -> 1161.18s]  Why did that? What? What's with the boundaries? Why are the boundaries here?
[1167.24s -> 1173.72s]  Somebody gave 100 bucks. Mega Mube just gave 100 dollars. Thank you so much, dude. I haven't been
[1173.72s -> 1176.84s]  able to watch your stream very much recently, but still love every second of the VODs.
[1176.84s -> 1182.63s]  Hope this helps a little with settling into the new place. Thank you. Thank you so much,
[1182.63s -> 1186.84s]  Mega Mube. Well, you haven't been able to watch very much recently. I haven't really
[1186.84s -> 1191.26s]  been able to stream very much recently. So all right, so let's do this the actual way I'm
[1191.26s -> 1198.49s]  supposed to do it. Okay. Get on the train. Quick. All of you. Any bright ideas? I kill all three.
[1198.49s -> 1210.34s]  Yeah. Oh, I don't have, I don't have anything else. Well, I want this instead. Get on the train.
[1211.38s -> 1222.39s]  I hear so much as a footstep from this car. You'll end up like all your friends out here.
[1223.11s -> 1228.44s]  I have honor level? I told you to get on the train. Look, all you had, I'm not,
[1228.92s -> 1235.32s]  if you follow instructions, you're gonna be fine. How do I take, I need to go to the engine car?
[1235.32s -> 1248.15s]  What do they leave? What if they run away? I'm supposed to leave them back here? I don't know
[1248.15s -> 1253.90s]  if I want to do that. No, I'm not gonna, these guys listen. These guys follow directions.
[1260.60s -> 1282.41s]  Can I climb? What, what's going on? What was that? Okay. My horse is fine. How do I know
[1282.41s -> 1286.17s]  that they're gonna stay? If I'm that guy, I'm just gonna walk off the train right now.
[1286.17s -> 1293.70s]  No way to be found. They are running. What are you talking about? They're running.
[1296.50s -> 1310.71s]  No, that, where? No, they're not. They're gonna remember this. That's fine. I want them to.
[1315.43s -> 1321.34s]  One person said that. It doesn't matter how many people say it. Let's get this thing moving.
[1328.78s -> 1339.94s]  Why don't I stay on the train? If I'm one of these guys, I'm gonna lean out the window
[1339.94s -> 1348.17s]  and be like, sucker. I would throw a rock out the window at him. As you're gonna get,
[1348.17s -> 1356.02s]  you can catch the train. There's a bunch of heavy books in there. I'd whip a book
[1356.02s -> 1360.31s]  at him and try to hit him right in the head as hard as I could. I'd probably miss.
[1361.11s -> 1365.51s]  You ever try to throw something as hard as you can at something and you just,
[1365.51s -> 1380.98s]  you weigh off. That's what happens every time we get out of this hole. We're going to try
[1380.98s -> 1384.90s]  whether it seems stable. And we just robbed the Leviticus Cornwall train.
[1384.90s -> 1390.66s]  We got money. It's the worst is behind us gentlemen. I'm an outlaw. I know this country
[1390.66s -> 1396.50s]  a little tuck them into bed camp in horseshoe overlook near Valentine. We'll be able to
[1396.50s -> 1401.46s]  hide out there. No problem. As long as we keep our noses clean. Well, then let's go
[1401.54s -> 1408.10s]  clean noses and everything else. Arthur, you're in that one. I know you two like to talk about
[1408.10s -> 1419.61s]  the good old days and what's gone wrong with old Dutch tuck them in. Nice. Well, that's a nice
[1419.61s -> 1437.66s]  icy waterfall. I'm glad we're getting to the title screen song with lyrics because
[1437.66s -> 1459.02s]  that's definitely where we are. This just sounds like somebody that's a karaoke
[1460.06s -> 1464.06s]  and they don't know the lyrics to the song for a whole portion. And then she's
[1464.06s -> 1480.81s]  going to sing the chorus. I don't even know the fucking chorus. Wow. Get over here. Yes, boss.
[1480.81s -> 1485.37s]  You two ride up ahead. Make sure there's no surprises. We've had enough of those.
[1485.37s -> 1495.08s]  Me with the boy. Come on, kid. You can buy me a whiskey. That sounds pretty good.
[1516.47s -> 1521.11s]  No, it's too easy. That's too easy. It's too easy to dump them during the song.
[1522.07s -> 1523.75s]  It's too easy.
[1526.71s -> 1532.07s]  Oh, I thought the horse went through the earth. Hey, hey, go. Oh,
[1536.50s -> 1542.84s]  I thought that the horse went all the way through. That was a preemptive.
[1542.84s -> 1546.28s]  I'm laughing. What the fuck? How do we lose a wheel?
[1548.90s -> 1552.15s]  So what's supposed to happen?
[1562.25s -> 1568.17s]  Hey, Charles, you and me hold the thing up while you try and put the wheel back on that.
[1574.73s -> 1587.27s]  Okay, lift it up. I'm playing house slipper again. That's all it takes. Oh yeah,
[1587.27s -> 1593.11s]  this is back in like the 1100s, right? The wheel was just invented.
[1594.54s -> 1596.46s]  Of course they're going to have technical problems with it.
[1597.18s -> 1616.04s]  You think? Trouble? Uh oh. We wouldn't have seen them.
[1616.76s -> 1626.15s]  We're bastards. We really screwed them over down here. Come on, let's not push our luck.
[1626.15s -> 1630.55s]  What happened? Well, get in. I'll tell you.
[1633.46s -> 1640.79s]  Here comes the whole story. Back to the wagon.
[1646.12s -> 1649.56s]  You can switch between different radar sizes in the compass by holding that.
[1652.55s -> 1656.79s]  Yeah, expand. No, no, no. Regular is fine.
[1658.84s -> 1663.29s]  I'll keep it on regular. That's fine. The Indians in these parts got sold a very raw deal.
[1664.38s -> 1668.30s]  This is the heartland we're going to. Good farming and grazing country.
[1669.34s -> 1672.22s]  We're just browsing around right now. We can take our time here.
[1672.22s -> 1677.98s]  Every blade of grass killed or heard it up to the reservations in the middle of nowhere.
[1679.48s -> 1684.68s]  There we go. This is more scenic. Kangaroo, kangaroo, get the kangaroo.
[1687.88s -> 1694.09s]  It's a four-legged kangaroo. How do I take out my gun?
[1704.76s -> 1705.08s]  Hey.
[1715.80s -> 1720.04s]  Don't mean he knows a damn thing about what he's talking about.
[1720.04s -> 1721.88s]  I'm trying. I'm just going regular speed.
[1723.26s -> 1726.26s]  So what happened to your trap?
[1727.30s -> 1730.79s]  I don't even know. It's not that I can remember.
[1730.79s -> 1734.60s]  My father was a cousin. Yes, the southern kangaroo.
[1734.60s -> 1738.12s]  He told me he lived with our people for a while. A number of freemen did.
[1739.08s -> 1742.74s]  Moved from our land. Three of us fled.
[1742.74s -> 1745.94s]  You got to know a family of like four is going to drive by then.
[1745.94s -> 1749.62s]  They're all going to turn their heads and go, oh, no.
[1750.18s -> 1752.10s]  Some soldiers captured my mother.
[1752.10s -> 1755.22s]  Took her somewhere. We never saw her again.
[1755.22s -> 1759.40s]  We drifted around. He was a very sad man.
[1759.40s -> 1764.94s]  Where clothes appropriate. I'm 13. I just took off on my own.
[1764.94s -> 1767.78s]  I was about the age we found young Arthur here.
[1767.78s -> 1771.72s]  Maybe a little older. A delinquent you never did see.
[1772.28s -> 1773.40s]  But he learned fast.
[1774.12s -> 1776.71s]  I was fast as Marston, apparently.
[1777.59s -> 1781.91s]  Wait, I don't understand. What's the problem between you two?
[1781.91s -> 1785.03s]  Nice shot. Yeah, it's a long story.
[1787.46s -> 1789.22s]  Do a flip with the carriage.
[1789.22s -> 1791.14s]  We still heading the right way.
[1791.14s -> 1795.70s]  That depends. Are we still heading west in search of fortune
[1795.70s -> 1798.66s]  and repose in virgin forests as we plan?
[1799.30s -> 1802.02s]  No. Are we heading in the correct direction
[1802.02s -> 1805.14s]  on our desperate escape from the law eastwards down the mountain?
[1805.14s -> 1806.26s]  We're going the right way still.
[1806.26s -> 1809.46s]  Yes, I believe so. You know this area?
[1809.46s -> 1812.02s]  A little. I've been through a couple of times.
[1812.82s -> 1816.18s]  There's a livestock town not too far from here called Valentine.
[1816.82s -> 1821.14s]  Cowboys, outlaws, working girls, power kind of place.
[1823.46s -> 1825.62s]  Is this boring? Hey, we're doing the tutorial, man.
[1825.62s -> 1826.74s]  We're just trying to enjoy the game.
[1826.74s -> 1828.02s]  In this place we're going.
[1828.74s -> 1830.90s]  Wait, what's it called again?
[1830.90s -> 1832.18s]  Horseshoe Overlook.
[1832.18s -> 1833.46s]  I don't think I can even control this.
[1833.46s -> 1834.34s]  It's a good place to lie low.
[1834.34s -> 1834.98s]  It'll do for now.
[1834.98s -> 1836.90s]  I can't go anywhere because I'm straight.
[1836.90s -> 1838.82s]  How long do you think Dutch is really going to lie?
[1839.78s -> 1844.10s]  It's just, you know, maybe it's me who's changed, not him,
[1844.10s -> 1848.02s]  but we kept telling him that fairy job didn't feel right.
[1848.66s -> 1851.54s]  You and me had a real lead in Blackwater that could have worked out.
[1853.46s -> 1855.86s]  It just isn't like Dutch to lose his head like that.
[1855.86s -> 1857.94s]  When do we fight the wild west orcs?
[1862.65s -> 1866.38s]  What? This isn't like Skyrim.
[1866.62s -> 1869.10s]  Dutch, abandon this line.
[1869.10s -> 1875.72s]  We're still here, so I figure we must have got a ride to hell.
[1882.95s -> 1884.39s]  Who's eating?
[1886.84s -> 1889.48s]  Just some yarrow and ginseng.
[1889.48s -> 1890.20s]  Good for the health.
[1891.16s -> 1893.48s]  Better than that stuff you buy in the store.
[1893.48s -> 1895.72s]  Yeah, you can have all this.
[1896.52s -> 1899.24s]  I'm at the point where I can do it with my eyes closed.
[1899.24s -> 1901.80s]  Why don't you just wish sometimes that you could just eat this and be fine?
[1903.64s -> 1908.92s]  Eating sometimes is just a pain in the ass, don't you guys think?
[1912.79s -> 1915.66s]  I mean, I love food, but they're going to be annoying.
[1915.66s -> 1916.70s]  It's something you have to do.
[1916.70s -> 1917.50s]  It's like sleeping.
[1918.22s -> 1919.50s]  Think about your entire day.
[1921.86s -> 1924.98s]  Like 60% of your whole day is eating and sleeping.
[1925.86s -> 1926.42s]  Come on, man.
[1926.42s -> 1929.50s]  Like, where's the science there?
[1929.50s -> 1929.98s]  Let's go.
[1945.85s -> 1948.33s]  Oh, boy, this discussion again.
[1955.03s -> 1956.07s]  So just stop eating.
[1956.07s -> 1956.87s]  What's the big deal?
[1962.92s -> 1963.42s]  Okay.
[1967.85s -> 1969.78s]  Wait, what does it want to do?
[1971.98s -> 1972.94s]  Oh, stop the wagon.
[1975.64s -> 1976.84s]  Turn and stop.
[1981.75s -> 1982.25s]  Stop.
[1983.03s -> 1984.36s]  Do I have to back it up?
[1987.83s -> 1988.63s]  All right, back up.
[1989.43s -> 1997.78s]  Where is he?
[1998.42s -> 2002.09s]  He's right around this rock.
[2006.38s -> 2007.88s]  Telephone's ringing.
[2009.59s -> 2010.07s]  All right.
[2010.07s -> 2011.27s]  There he is over here, right?
[2013.74s -> 2014.38s]  Where is he?
[2015.02s -> 2015.98s]  Oh, my God.
[2015.98s -> 2017.10s]  Where is he?
[2017.10s -> 2022.74s]  Wasn't he right here?
[2027.13s -> 2031.05s]  Look at the map.
[2031.05s -> 2032.49s]  I mean, yeah, but wait, wait, wait.
[2032.49s -> 2033.05s]  Oh, there he is.
[2034.01s -> 2035.77s]  He got stuck in my shit, so he started walking.
[2036.65s -> 2042.12s]  All right, get on.
[2043.00s -> 2043.56s]  Can I beep?
[2051.29s -> 2052.09s]  Run him over.
[2052.09s -> 2054.09s]  No, I have to be like at least a decent person.
[2054.81s -> 2055.45s]  All right, get on.
[2064.38s -> 2064.86s]  Get on.
[2067.35s -> 2068.15s]  Where's the beep?
[2069.03s -> 2070.31s]  How do I peep at this guy?
[2087.48s -> 2088.68s]  Wait, did he disappear?
[2098.12s -> 2099.32s]  All right, we made it.
[2100.12s -> 2101.16s]  Home sweet home.
[2101.16s -> 2101.80s]  There we are.
[2102.04s -> 2103.00s]  Good thing that you made it.
[2111.62s -> 2112.58s]  He made it before we did.
[2113.14s -> 2122.58s]  I've never seen somebody fuck this section up.
[2122.58s -> 2125.38s]  Well, have you ever seen somebody do that whole section in cinematic mode?
[2132.28s -> 2134.68s]  Now you have it, now you have it, now you have it, now you have it, now you have it, now you have it.
[2153.93s -> 2155.37s]  I ain't got that long, Dutch.
[2155.37s -> 2157.05s]  I want folks safe before I go.
[2157.05s -> 2157.77s]  Me too.
[2157.77s -> 2160.73s]  And now we are stuck east of the Gritsleys and out of money
[2161.37s -> 2165.05s]  and a long way from our dream of virgin land in the west.
[2165.05s -> 2168.41s]  I know, my brother, but we are safe.
[2168.41s -> 2170.09s]  We make a bit of money here.
[2170.09s -> 2173.93s]  Then we move again, head out around the west of Uncle Sam.
[2173.93s -> 2175.29s]  That's really hard to do.
[2175.29s -> 2176.25s]  Buy some land.
[2176.81s -> 2177.53s]  I hope so.
[2178.09s -> 2181.77s]  Would you just look around you?
[2182.65s -> 2186.14s]  This world has its consolations.
[2187.72s -> 2191.08s]  Gentlemen, I'm going to head into the local town
[2191.08s -> 2194.68s]  and, you know, see if I can strike up a little business.
[2195.24s -> 2196.68s]  Of course, Herr Strauss.
[2197.24s -> 2199.40s]  I prefer robbing banks to usury.
[2200.04s -> 2202.28s]  Seems more dignified somehow.
[2203.16s -> 2206.92s]  Now, everyone, put your tools down for a moment.
[2206.92s -> 2208.36s]  Come on, gather round.
[2208.36s -> 2209.08s]  Quickly now.
[2209.08s -> 2210.12s]  We're gonna need a speech.
[2210.12s -> 2212.68s]  I know that things have been tough.
[2213.96s -> 2216.52s]  Frio coming in with five community subs.
[2218.63s -> 2219.27s]  Thanks a lot, man.
[2219.27s -> 2222.07s]  So it is time for everyone to get to work.
[2222.07s -> 2224.07s]  Get to work, but stay out of trouble.
[2224.63s -> 2226.63s]  Remember, we are itinerant workers.
[2226.63s -> 2230.39s]  Laid off when they shut down our factory to the north.
[2230.39s -> 2233.75s]  Now get out there and see what you can find.
[2233.75s -> 2237.19s]  Uncle, Reverend Swanson, no more passengers.
[2238.07s -> 2243.35s]  It is time for everyone to earn their keep.
[2243.43s -> 2247.11s]  There is a town a little way down the track name of Valentine.
[2247.11s -> 2247.67s]  Can you play?
[2247.67s -> 2248.55s]  I'm playing the game.
[2248.55s -> 2251.27s]  I've stopped down all mard and morons, if I remember right.
[2251.27s -> 2251.91s]  This is the game.
[2251.91s -> 2253.19s]  That seems a decent place to start.
[2253.19s -> 2255.99s]  And we need food, real food.
[2255.99s -> 2258.07s]  That means every day, one of you.
[2258.07s -> 2260.79s]  Now remember, whatever it is that you find.
[2260.79s -> 2261.99s]  It looks like it's from a different game
[2261.99s -> 2263.99s]  that somebody created and put them in here like a mod.
[2263.99s -> 2264.87s]  Gets, gets, slice.
[2266.15s -> 2267.59s]  Now be sensible out there.
[2268.47s -> 2271.45s]  Now the girls have your tent ready, Mr. Morgan.
[2271.45s -> 2271.93s]  Come with me.
[2272.65s -> 2274.25s]  So we have a donation box.
[2274.25s -> 2275.21s]  We put you over here.
[2275.77s -> 2279.05s]  I'm sure everything will be fine, Miss Grimshaw.
[2279.05s -> 2279.69s]  It should be.
[2279.69s -> 2281.85s]  Most of your stuff from Blackwater got saved.
[2281.85s -> 2283.53s]  Everything apart from my money.
[2283.53s -> 2284.65s]  Oh, don't remind me.
[2284.65s -> 2287.37s]  Well, we can always make more money.
[2287.37s -> 2288.25s]  We're going to have to.
[2289.21s -> 2292.41s]  Miss Jackson, I've seen shit with more common sense.
[2292.41s -> 2294.25s]  Sleep shame or change clothes at your tent.
[2296.44s -> 2297.48s]  Burz, I don't know why for a second.
[2297.48s -> 2298.68s]  I thought he was going to burn his clothes.
[2299.85s -> 2301.21s]  I'm done with these.
[2301.21s -> 2302.41s]  I think I'm going to get rid of them.
[2303.53s -> 2309.37s]  Horseshoe Overlook, chapter two.
[2309.37s -> 2310.33s]  That was chapter one.
[2310.33s -> 2311.53s]  How many chapters are there?
[2312.33s -> 2317.00s]  That's not how you guys change clothes.
[2320.73s -> 2321.69s]  What did they do before?
[2322.97s -> 2323.77s]  No, never mind.
[2323.77s -> 2325.05s]  That's a stupid thing to say.
[2325.77s -> 2326.89s]  What did they do before?
[2326.89s -> 2327.37s]  Laundry.
[2328.65s -> 2329.85s]  They just left this clothes on.
[2335.74s -> 2336.86s]  You rinsed it in a stream.
[2337.58s -> 2339.96s]  Dutch seems a little better.
[2340.60s -> 2343.34s]  His eyes are sparkling once more.
[2343.34s -> 2345.50s]  Funny guys, funny number joke.
[2346.86s -> 2348.86s]  I think we all feel a little happier.
[2348.86s -> 2350.52s]  So this is a few weeks later.
[2350.52s -> 2351.96s]  Despite of Blackwater and that.
[2351.96s -> 2359.23s]  Jose.
[2360.01s -> 2365.83s]  Quite a day.
[2365.83s -> 2367.19s]  Eat, drink, play.
[2367.19s -> 2368.15s]  Let's hope so.
[2368.15s -> 2369.03s]  At Dave and Busters.
[2369.03s -> 2371.99s]  There's a bunch of the boys already in Valentine.
[2371.99s -> 2373.51s]  You've got to maintain your course, don't you?
[2374.63s -> 2376.15s]  Half price Wednesdays.
[2376.15s -> 2379.19s]  Oh, by the way, half price is actually what it should be every day
[2379.19s -> 2381.59s]  because it's like four dollars to play one game here.
[2385.27s -> 2385.83s]  Don't come here.
[2393.27s -> 2396.94s]  What are you saying?
[2396.94s -> 2398.46s]  You guys don't have, you don't, you never played,
[2398.46s -> 2399.50s]  you went to Dave and Busters?
[2399.50s -> 2400.94s]  Cam, camera.
[2400.94s -> 2404.22s]  Your games can't be shown by a symbol on the map.
[2406.66s -> 2408.02s]  Eagle talent, talisman.
[2408.02s -> 2410.02s]  Okay, so your beard is getting long.
[2410.02s -> 2411.38s]  You can use the shaving kit beside your tent
[2411.38s -> 2413.06s]  or visit a barbershop to maintain your facial hair.
[2415.40s -> 2416.36s]  Nothing at all.
[2416.92s -> 2420.44s]  For the first time in weeks, nothing.
[2420.44s -> 2421.83s]  We're free.
[2421.83s -> 2423.11s]  Okay, there's lots of details here.
[2423.11s -> 2423.91s]  Hold on.
[2423.91s -> 2429.08s]  So you got permanently increases the time
[2429.08s -> 2431.16s]  that eagle eye can stay active for five seconds.
[2432.06s -> 2434.38s]  Crafted from rare legendary animal parts.
[2435.18s -> 2438.04s]  Permanently decreases the damage the player receives
[2438.04s -> 2439.40s]  while on horseback by 10 percent.
[2440.36s -> 2441.88s]  Okay, that's interesting.
[2441.88s -> 2443.00s]  You can make little charms.
[2444.23s -> 2446.15s]  A hundred and seventy eight animals.
[2448.38s -> 2448.88s]  What?
[2450.98s -> 2452.74s]  There were like four in the last game.
[2453.56s -> 2460.52s]  Deer, bear, coyote, and like rabbit, right?
[2462.36s -> 2465.72s]  Six gangs, 30 fish, 74 pieces of equipment.
[2465.72s -> 2466.52s]  This seems huge.
[2468.65s -> 2474.20s]  Hey, I discovered the deer and the bears.
[2474.76s -> 2475.40s]  Where's the bear?
[2477.40s -> 2478.68s]  How have I not discovered the bear?
[2479.58s -> 2481.34s]  I literally shot him in the face with an arrow.
[2484.12s -> 2485.08s]  It's easy to track them.
[2488.97s -> 2490.26s]  Okay, I see.
[2490.26s -> 2490.76s]  All right.
[2495.62s -> 2498.26s]  Bring Pearson animals to supply the camp.
[2498.26s -> 2500.58s]  He can use the meat for food and skins to craft satchels
[2500.58s -> 2501.62s]  with increased capacity.
[2502.50s -> 2504.46s]  All right, there's a lot going on.
[2504.46s -> 2505.42s]  Let me take a look.
[2505.42s -> 2508.06s]  Let me, I don't care what that guy has to say right now.
[2509.24s -> 2510.60s]  Let's like, let's do some shaving.
[2512.41s -> 2514.89s]  Now, is this like, is this like the,
[2515.69s -> 2516.73s]  you guys remember,
[2516.73s -> 2518.17s]  no one's gonna know what I'm talking about here.
[2520.47s -> 2523.75s]  The magnet face thing where you have the magnet hair
[2523.75s -> 2524.47s]  on the guy's face.
[2524.47s -> 2525.99s]  It was like a 14 cent toy.
[2530.55s -> 2531.51s]  Length.
[2531.51s -> 2535.34s]  Oh, you actually can do this.
[2535.98s -> 2539.45s]  Hold on, chin.
[2541.48s -> 2543.24s]  Oh, I think I doesn't want a dirty chin.
[2551.24s -> 2552.04s]  I don't know.
[2552.04s -> 2552.76s]  What do you think?
[2553.98s -> 2555.42s]  Just gigantic chops?
[2558.01s -> 2558.51s]  Hmm.
[2563.42s -> 2565.74s]  No, I just want the piece of hair for my chin
[2565.74s -> 2567.02s]  to go down as far as it can go.
[2570.39s -> 2570.89s]  Yeah.
[2583.10s -> 2586.70s]  I'm gonna look like an Amish guy.
[2600.65s -> 2603.77s]  Can I dye my whole like face purple and my beard purple?
[2606.22s -> 2606.94s]  Yeah, that's good.
[2608.20s -> 2609.00s]  Okay.
[2609.00s -> 2610.70s]  I like it like this so far.
[2610.70s -> 2613.83s]  I'm gonna keep that going as long as it can go.
[2617.75s -> 2622.39s]  The current stock levels are shown when near the tithing box.
[2623.27s -> 2624.58s]  All right, let's take a look.
[2626.30s -> 2628.38s]  Now, that's perfectly balanced facial hair.
[2629.02s -> 2631.94s]  Here's something to make a stew.
[2631.94s -> 2632.90s]  You can eat from the pot.
[2633.46s -> 2637.16s]  I'm getting a lot of info here.
[2637.80s -> 2644.62s]  Uh-huh.
[2646.46s -> 2647.66s]  They demanded to know.
[2647.66s -> 2649.82s]  It's like lore in case you want to see it.
[2653.88s -> 2655.56s]  Let me just like take it in for a second here
[2655.56s -> 2656.76s]  because here's the donation box.
[2657.64s -> 2659.48s]  How much should I, how much money should I give?
[2660.44s -> 2660.94s]  Contribute.
[2661.66s -> 2666.28s]  How much can I contribute if I don't give money?
[2668.41s -> 2668.91s]  Okay.
[2669.29s -> 2685.56s]  I did my, somebody's, somebody's slurping out of a big gulp.
[2685.56s -> 2686.36s]  What the hell was that?
[2686.92s -> 2695.00s]  It was a radio.
[2695.00s -> 2697.08s]  I thought somebody said like a giant soda.
[2697.80s -> 2704.09s]  Let's keep looking around.
[2704.09s -> 2704.59s]  Hold on.
[2705.13s -> 2706.57s]  Food, I want to get, let me eat some stew.
[2707.37s -> 2710.78s]  Yeah, that's less, that's less than a hundred bits.
[2710.78s -> 2711.50s]  I ain't gonna read it.
[2712.38s -> 2713.61s]  It's a stew.
[2713.61s -> 2714.49s]  What kind of stew is it?
[2715.13s -> 2722.73s]  It's not, is it not done?
[2727.32s -> 2728.64s]  I want some of that.
[2729.28s -> 2730.24s]  How do I get some of that?
[2731.44s -> 2738.65s]  Oh, okay.
[2738.65s -> 2740.41s]  I have to take, I have to actually pick the bowl up.
[2740.41s -> 2743.45s]  This is the one, two parts here.
[2744.09s -> 2748.70s]  I only get to eat once every few days.
[2749.50s -> 2756.65s]  I can just walk around and talk while eating.
[2758.41s -> 2761.55s]  All right, this is pretty cool.
[2761.55s -> 2762.43s]  All right, this is good.
[2763.23s -> 2769.79s]  Can I throw it like, like acid?
[2769.79s -> 2770.91s]  Can I throw it in somebody's face?
[2771.79s -> 2777.87s]  How do I, I want to talk.
[2780.56s -> 2781.44s]  All right, I'm gonna sit here.
[2786.92s -> 2790.27s]  Am I allowed at this part, at the lunch table?
[2794.51s -> 2794.91s]  What the fuck?
[2794.91s -> 2795.87s]  Nobody wants to talk to me.
[2797.39s -> 2799.31s]  I can't sit with the cool kids at the lunch table.
[2811.36s -> 2812.96s]  Hey, no, I wasn't done with that.
[2814.80s -> 2816.16s]  Sit back down and eat the rest of that.
[2823.64s -> 2824.36s]  Okay, I can talk.
[2833.02s -> 2837.58s]  That was a, that was as shitty as a conversation as what's the weather like.
[2837.58s -> 2839.02s]  In this, look at that weather, huh?
[2839.98s -> 2844.60s]  I only get to eat once every three days and I'm gonna leave half my plate.
[2845.32s -> 2848.48s]  What am I at?
[2848.48s -> 2849.28s]  The olive garden?
[2849.92s -> 2856.88s]  Okay, what's over here?
[2857.52s -> 2866.72s]  Oh, this guy, this is the guy shaving the turkey.
[2867.52s -> 2869.24s]  Crafting upgrades, donate.
[2874.04s -> 2876.44s]  Look, I'll give you some meat so we get a feather.
[2877.24s -> 2882.99s]  Here, you can have, you can have a, you can have a bird feather.
[2889.53s -> 2890.17s]  I'm getting money here.
[2891.45s -> 2893.37s]  Donate all, donate for provisions.
[2894.25s -> 2895.21s]  I think I want to do that.
[2895.77s -> 2903.26s]  Donated, springy meat, donated.
[2903.26s -> 2904.06s]  I'm just gonna give it to him.
[2904.86s -> 2908.68s]  This is fish meat.
[2910.44s -> 2913.00s]  Two pieces of meat and we got some venison here.
[2913.64s -> 2917.93s]  Can I like cook on the, I'm just gonna give them all.
[2917.93s -> 2918.65s]  Just take it all.
[2919.53s -> 2921.87s]  Don't say like I never gave you nothing.
[2921.87s -> 2926.19s]  Just take it.
[2930.59s -> 2931.63s]  Oh shit, okay, hold on.
[2932.35s -> 2934.81s]  Can I not give these?
[2935.77s -> 2940.14s]  All right, so crafting upgrades.
[2940.14s -> 2940.86s]  Let's see what I can do here.
[2943.58s -> 2946.06s]  Okay, so craft satchel, increase carrying capacity.
[2947.26s -> 2952.33s]  Tonic satchel, I can't do any of these.
[2954.78s -> 2955.66s]  Oh god damn it.
[2955.66s -> 2959.36s]  I need like person, fusion cannot craft this yet.
[2959.36s -> 2960.24s]  I can't craft any of these.
[2960.96s -> 2966.78s]  Okay, so I need to purchase leather working tools
[2966.78s -> 2968.38s]  and upgrade the medicine wagon twice.
[2969.58s -> 2970.78s]  I got so much work to do.
[2970.78s -> 2971.90s]  There's a lot of work here.
[2972.70s -> 2974.75s]  I can make my own house.
[2975.47s -> 2980.48s]  I need one perfect ram carcass.
[2981.12s -> 2983.40s]  Cleaned up ram skull to be displayed at your tent.
[2986.68s -> 2988.12s]  Drugs, I don't have anything.
[2989.79s -> 2991.95s]  Upgrade the main camp's campfire.
[2992.91s -> 2995.69s]  I don't have any of this shit.
[2995.69s -> 2996.97s]  I need to like play the game first.
[2999.24s -> 3000.52s]  All right, well, thanks for the money.
[3001.24s -> 3003.32s]  What about you?
[3005.02s -> 3006.14s]  Morning, Mr. Morgan.
[3007.31s -> 3008.11s]  There's a guy over here.
[3008.67s -> 3009.95s]  What do the exclamation points mean?
[3010.67s -> 3013.66s]  Oh, these are provisions or something, right?
[3014.22s -> 3016.14s]  Can I like, I can take certain amount of provisions every day?
[3017.10s -> 3018.30s]  I'm assuming they're not grayed out.
[3021.68s -> 3022.80s]  Right, that would make sense, wouldn't it?
[3024.54s -> 3025.90s]  Needs to be restocked.
[3025.90s -> 3027.50s]  Okay, well, I'm just gonna go.
[3028.30s -> 3028.94s]  Let's do a mission.
[3029.58s -> 3034.56s]  Where's my horse?
[3040.14s -> 3041.66s]  Do the mission, do the mission.
[3041.66s -> 3043.26s]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[3043.26s -> 3045.90s]  How are we doing on our stamina?
[3047.05s -> 3048.81s]  You can command your horse to stay,
[3048.81s -> 3051.37s]  flee, or follow by focusing on it with the L2 when it's nearby.
[3053.53s -> 3057.82s]  Yes, I'm on it currently.
[3057.82s -> 3061.82s]  All right, so we got G, E, U, or R, S.
[3063.34s -> 3064.62s]  We're gonna go towards G, E.
[3065.82s -> 3075.18s]  Galloping horses cause stamina drain.
[3075.18s -> 3075.98s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[3076.94s -> 3079.90s]  173 bullets, 41, 173.
[3080.86s -> 3086.46s]  Okay, I have ammo, so I'm just gonna go.
[3086.46s -> 3091.68s]  Hold X to maintain the horse's canter and quench some stamina.
[3091.68s -> 3092.16s]  Sounds good.
[3099.47s -> 3103.92s]  The world has opened up now.
[3104.56s -> 3106.92s]  We're going to the first mission.
[3115.98s -> 3116.86s]  Hold up, hold up, hold up.
[3116.86s -> 3117.82s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[3117.82s -> 3118.78s]  Wait, wait, wait, an animal.
[3118.78s -> 3121.74s]  An animal I can take and bring back to the, to the, what is it?
[3121.74s -> 3122.70s]  It's a turkey.
[3122.70s -> 3123.34s]  It's a turkey.
[3126.28s -> 3127.08s]  Study the turkey.
[3127.80s -> 3131.32s]  Where is it?
[3131.32s -> 3131.80s]  There it is.
[3131.80s -> 3132.20s]  Study it.
[3134.17s -> 3134.89s]  Can I talk to them?
[3135.69s -> 3137.45s]  How did you, I ran it over.
[3138.09s -> 3142.76s]  All right, let's go study them.
[3142.76s -> 3160.36s]  Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[3160.36s -> 3160.92s]  Bird meat.
[3161.56s -> 3164.04s]  When you skin or pluck an animal, you take meat from the carcass
[3164.04s -> 3165.88s]  and you can cook and eat this meat at a campfire.
[3165.88s -> 3166.84s]  I, we need to take this back.
[3167.72s -> 3173.80s]  Can I like throw it at somebody?
[3175.08s -> 3175.96s]  No, that's a gun.
[3176.68s -> 3177.72s]  All right, we're gonna take this back.
[3178.36s -> 3184.49s]  All right, there's another one over here.
[3184.49s -> 3185.21s]  Where's the other turkey?
[3189.90s -> 3191.18s]  Pick up and examine.
[3191.82s -> 3194.06s]  So it's a random wild mushroom.
[3194.78s -> 3200.81s]  Parasol mushroom is a health herb.
[3200.81s -> 3202.33s]  It can be eaten to refill your health core
[3202.41s -> 3203.77s]  or be crafted to as bait.
[3204.41s -> 3205.29s]  What can I eat?
[3206.01s -> 3206.91s]  What do I eat?
[3210.24s -> 3210.96s]  This is dangerous.
[3210.96s -> 3211.44s]  I don't know why.
[3211.44s -> 3212.96s]  I don't think anyone should do this.
[3212.96s -> 3215.42s]  Oh, we're fine.
[3215.42s -> 3216.83s]  Okay, give me the other turkey.
[3218.75s -> 3220.51s]  This time, I'm not gonna skin this one.
[3220.51s -> 3221.31s]  I'm gonna bring this back to,
[3222.03s -> 3222.99s]  but I don't know what his name is.
[3223.79s -> 3231.90s]  Who's that?
[3231.90s -> 3236.75s]  Who's this guy?
[3238.27s -> 3242.70s]  You think I got a problem?
[3243.68s -> 3245.28s]  He ain't getting eaten one of these turkeys.
[3245.28s -> 3246.48s]  I'm guaranteeing you that.
[3247.04s -> 3258.48s]  How many turkeys can I put on one horse?
[3267.42s -> 3267.92s]  What?
[3268.88s -> 3269.92s]  I'm just messing with you.
[3273.26s -> 3274.22s]  I'm just messing with you, dude.
[3282.41s -> 3282.73s]  Hold on.
[3282.73s -> 3283.21s]  You can...
[3283.21s -> 3283.93s]  How do I rob him?
[3293.60s -> 3294.64s]  No, no, wait.
[3294.64s -> 3295.60s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3296.56s -> 3302.88s]  No, I didn't...
[3302.88s -> 3303.60s]  Just stop moving.
[3304.32s -> 3310.56s]  Where's it going?
[3310.56s -> 3311.36s]  GE?
[3311.36s -> 3312.00s]  That guy.
[3312.00s -> 3313.12s]  Wait, that guy might have something.
[3313.84s -> 3316.08s]  Oh, there's a witness.
[3317.82s -> 3318.78s]  The horse is the witness?
[3319.42s -> 3320.54s]  It's this guy.
[3321.18s -> 3325.02s]  Stop.
[3325.02s -> 3325.42s]  Hands up.
[3326.06s -> 3328.12s]  Get your hands in the air.
[3331.55s -> 3331.87s]  Stop.
[3332.59s -> 3334.54s]  Stop it.
[3334.54s -> 3335.50s]  I don't want to have to do this.
[3336.22s -> 3340.78s]  Stop.
[3341.26s -> 3348.54s]  Stop moving.
[3360.33s -> 3360.97s]  Come on now.
[3361.77s -> 3378.43s]  What do you have?
[3379.63s -> 3379.95s]  Hey.
[3380.75s -> 3384.28s]  All right, I got to get rid of this guy.
[3384.92s -> 3389.44s]  Is this like Hitman?
[3390.00s -> 3392.28s]  Do I have to like bury him somewhere?
[3396.00s -> 3397.84s]  He's sitting in the trees.
[3398.48s -> 3399.84s]  No more witnesses.
[3399.84s -> 3400.16s]  We're good.
[3400.72s -> 3406.84s]  What was he doing?
[3406.84s -> 3407.32s]  Oh, this way.
[3407.32s -> 3407.56s]  Okay.
[3410.88s -> 3412.16s]  You can't skin a person.
[3412.16s -> 3413.20s]  What are you talking about?
[3413.20s -> 3414.08s]  Wait, we're going this way.
[3422.73s -> 3428.91s]  No, you can't just rob and kill every person.
[3431.48s -> 3432.60s]  There are turkeys over here anyways,
[3432.60s -> 3433.56s]  and that's what we care about.
[3435.39s -> 3441.53s]  Where'd they go up here?
[3441.53s -> 3445.72s]  I don't see anybody.
[3447.98s -> 3448.78s]  No, they got away.
[3448.78s -> 3449.26s]  That's okay.
[3453.90s -> 3454.30s]  Study.
[3454.30s -> 3455.26s]  Wait, I can study sheep?
[3459.61s -> 3461.21s]  Hold binoculars while looking at them.
[3471.93s -> 3473.13s]  I don't understand.
[3473.13s -> 3473.61s]  Does that work?
[3484.57s -> 3488.17s]  I don't think it worked.
[3488.17s -> 3488.81s]  Go eat them?
[3489.53s -> 3490.57s]  What am I, the big bad wolf?
[3493.26s -> 3493.90s]  Okay, slow down.
[3493.90s -> 3495.26s]  No, I'll get in trouble here.
[3497.66s -> 3499.66s]  Animals attached to your horse will decompose.
[3499.66s -> 3500.62s]  Sell them before this happens.
[3500.62s -> 3501.34s]  Oh, shit.
[3501.34s -> 3502.14s]  I need to sell these.
[3502.94s -> 3505.98s]  Flies.
[3509.29s -> 3510.01s]  Study quick.
[3510.57s -> 3510.89s]  Come here.
[3510.89s -> 3511.21s]  Come here.
[3511.21s -> 3511.53s]  Come here.
[3511.53s -> 3511.77s]  No.
[3514.16s -> 3519.42s]  Got it.
[3519.42s -> 3519.98s]  All right.
[3519.98s -> 3520.38s]  Let's go.
[3523.44s -> 3525.84s]  That was a shot in the dark completely.
[3530.62s -> 3531.02s]  Made it.
[3531.74s -> 3535.13s]  I don't know how fast I can like full sprint over here though.
[3535.13s -> 3535.61s]  There we go.
[3535.61s -> 3536.01s]  We're good.
[3540.00s -> 3540.64s]  Hitch the horse.
[3543.00s -> 3544.44s]  Now we're at the general store.
[3545.56s -> 3547.87s]  No, I need the turkey.
[3547.87s -> 3548.27s]  Turkeys.
[3548.27s -> 3548.83s]  I need both.
[3548.83s -> 3549.47s]  I need a turkey.
[3550.27s -> 3550.59s]  Okay.
[3551.31s -> 3552.51s]  I got fresh turkeys here,
[3554.33s -> 3556.41s]  and I'm willing to sell it for a moderate price.
[3564.84s -> 3566.04s]  Bring that in here.
[3566.04s -> 3566.12s]  Go.
[3566.12s -> 3566.68s]  What?
[3566.68s -> 3568.76s]  Hey, what am I, what are you, what?
[3570.43s -> 3572.19s]  I'm trying to sell you a turkey, man.
[3572.19s -> 3573.07s]  Oh, don't do that.
[3573.07s -> 3575.02s]  I'll kick you out.
[3575.02s -> 3576.06s]  You can interact with the shopkeeper
[3576.06s -> 3576.94s]  by approaching the catalog.
[3581.26s -> 3581.50s]  What?
[3583.32s -> 3585.64s]  I just got kicked out for bringing a turkey.
[3589.15s -> 3589.87s]  Where's the butcher?
[3590.59s -> 3591.15s]  Pardon me.
[3593.26s -> 3593.82s]  God damn it.
[3593.82s -> 3594.22s]  Come here.
[3594.22s -> 3594.54s]  Let's go.
[3595.26s -> 3596.94s]  All right.
[3596.94s -> 3597.34s]  Here we go.
[3598.68s -> 3602.27s]  Hey, I got a, you can interact with the shopkeeper.
[3602.27s -> 3602.51s]  All right.
[3602.51s -> 3602.83s]  Let's go.
[3602.83s -> 3603.95s]  I'm going to throw it down on here.
[3604.59s -> 3606.80s]  I got some quality meat here.
[3611.53s -> 3611.93s]  All right.
[3611.93s -> 3614.01s]  I don't, I, I don't have to walk it over here.
[3614.01s -> 3614.25s]  Okay.
[3614.89s -> 3616.75s]  Sales of turkey meat.
[3617.47s -> 3621.07s]  Salted beef.
[3621.07s -> 3621.87s]  I'm going to keep that.
[3624.80s -> 3625.52s]  Turkey feathers.
[3627.23s -> 3627.71s]  50 cents.
[3627.71s -> 3628.19s]  That's not bad.
[3628.19s -> 3628.67s]  That's pretty good.
[3631.40s -> 3634.17s]  To sell a pelt stored on the back of your horse,
[3634.17s -> 3635.37s]  take your horse close to the butcher.
[3635.37s -> 3636.25s]  Oh, I got to get the horse.
[3642.35s -> 3642.76s]  All right.
[3642.76s -> 3643.32s]  Horse cargo.
[3643.32s -> 3644.44s]  What does he got on there?
[3644.44s -> 3646.67s]  Ooh, look at all this stuff.
[3648.76s -> 3649.72s]  I have so much shit here.
[3650.28s -> 3652.20s]  I got two championship pelts.
[3652.84s -> 3655.36s]  All right.
[3655.36s -> 3656.56s]  I don't think I can sell any of these.
[3656.56s -> 3658.40s]  Maybe I can time game.
[3659.12s -> 3661.15s]  I feel like I shouldn't sell these.
[3661.15s -> 3662.03s]  I'm probably going to need them.
[3665.08s -> 3665.32s]  All right.
[3665.32s -> 3666.52s]  Let's go find a Mr.
[3666.52s -> 3666.76s]  Mr.
[3666.76s -> 3667.40s]  G E.
[3667.40s -> 3669.40s]  Clips indicate optional stranger missions.
[3669.40s -> 3670.28s]  Speak to the stranger.
[3672.54s -> 3673.34s]  Question mark flip.
[3673.98s -> 3676.59s]  Do you see a dude?
[3676.59s -> 3677.39s]  I don't see one of them.
[3677.39s -> 3678.91s]  Do you see a question mark flip?
[3679.55s -> 3684.73s]  I don't see one.
[3686.01s -> 3687.64s]  All right.
[3687.64s -> 3688.04s]  Let's just go.
[3688.04s -> 3688.76s]  Let's find this guy.
[3689.66s -> 3690.78s]  I don't think he's in the store.
[3690.78s -> 3691.42s]  Probably down here.
[3692.22s -> 3693.74s]  I need to close.
[3694.46s -> 3695.98s]  Oh, no, I, I guess it is.
[3695.98s -> 3697.34s]  He's in this saloon.
[3706.84s -> 3709.32s]  The psycho in me just wants to like throw a chair in here.
[3709.32s -> 3712.04s]  But I know not yet.
[3712.04s -> 3712.44s]  Come here.
[3712.44s -> 3712.68s]  Come here.
[3712.68s -> 3713.08s]  Come over here.
[3713.08s -> 3714.12s]  I want you to meet our friends.
[3714.84s -> 3715.80s]  Pleased to meet you.
[3716.36s -> 3719.72s]  Why, you're just a toughest mountain man.
[3719.72s -> 3721.88s]  Oh, you be quiet, Anastasia.
[3721.88s -> 3725.24s]  Anyone can tell this one is a pussy cat.
[3725.24s -> 3725.88s]  Exactly.
[3725.88s -> 3728.44s]  Yes, he's a pussy cat.
[3728.44s -> 3729.80s]  Ain't that so, Arthur?
[3729.80s -> 3730.68s]  Whatever you say.
[3731.48s -> 3733.00s]  How much you cost, anyway.
[3733.00s -> 3735.56s]  Ain't that a nice way to talk to a lady?
[3735.56s -> 3738.52s]  Oh, I didn't know I was talking to a lady.
[3738.52s -> 3739.16s]  Excuse me.
[3741.48s -> 3746.04s]  Well, I must say, you gotta find way with the women, amigo.
[3746.04s -> 3748.65s]  They're dandy and a charm.
[3749.45s -> 3750.09s]  What's in there?
[3750.09s -> 3750.65s]  Chocolate milk?
[3750.65s -> 3753.05s]  Oh, man, I dread to think about it.
[3757.34s -> 3758.86s]  Hey, you motherfucker.
[3762.35s -> 3763.07s]  Barroom brawl.
[3763.07s -> 3763.95s]  This is where it starts.
[3764.83s -> 3770.08s]  This is what you came for.
[3775.44s -> 3777.28s]  This is for me to get my ass kicked.
[3778.08s -> 3784.01s]  What do you got?
[3784.01s -> 3785.47s]  Oh, what's that?
[3785.47s -> 3786.35s]  You just got dodged?
[3787.07s -> 3790.68s]  How do I pick up a chair?
[3791.24s -> 3793.00s]  Come on, there's gonna be something I can do here.
[3793.64s -> 3797.60s]  Wait, who's that?
[3798.32s -> 3801.10s]  Who is that guy?
[3801.10s -> 3802.06s]  Uh-oh, here's the boss.
[3808.75s -> 3809.55s]  Uh-oh, a chair.
[3814.86s -> 3817.50s]  Can I rip off the gas line and just throw a match in here?
[3818.22s -> 3822.11s]  Nice.
[3823.63s -> 3824.03s]  Pick up.
[3824.75s -> 3828.06s]  No, I want the, I don't want the hat.
[3828.06s -> 3828.70s]  I want the chair.
[3833.92s -> 3834.32s]  Hello?
[3835.47s -> 3835.87s]  Hello?
[3836.59s -> 3842.83s]  Oh, didn't even break the table.
[3843.47s -> 3844.41s]  Come on, man.
[3851.56s -> 3852.04s]  Let's go.
[3856.19s -> 3857.15s]  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[3857.15s -> 3858.03s]  Ear grab.
[3858.03s -> 3858.75s]  That's not cool.
[3859.63s -> 3876.57s]  Come on, he's bigger than me.
[3877.13s -> 3883.24s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3883.24s -> 3884.28s]  Scripted, scripted.
[3885.08s -> 3885.64s]  Scripted.
[3886.28s -> 3893.31s]  You blocked everything.
[3904.49s -> 3915.58s]  Uh-oh, I'm in trouble.
[3916.38s -> 3921.63s]  All right, am I missing something from the tutorial five days ago?
[3921.63s -> 3922.59s]  I never remember.
[3922.59s -> 3923.95s]  Am I, am I not doing something right here?
[3924.99s -> 3927.71s]  I think I'm, you hold the block.
[3927.71s -> 3928.91s]  You can dodge too, can't you?
[3929.71s -> 3944.16s]  Counter attack.
[3944.16s -> 3948.56s]  But so you, what, you hold square and then hit like left to right right before he swings, right?
[3949.76s -> 3952.40s]  Remember, I did the first half of this tutorial five days ago.
[3953.68s -> 3955.36s]  I haven't turned it on since.
[3955.36s -> 3963.48s]  Just pressing the direction while holding the block.
[3967.61s -> 3968.49s]  Save the goatee?
[3968.49s -> 3968.73s]  No.
[3976.35s -> 3978.91s]  I'm gonna knock shower for the rest of the game.
[3981.88s -> 3983.88s]  Can I stay like this forever?
[3985.88s -> 3987.88s]  Can I just be the guy that got slimed the whole game?
[4015.13s -> 4018.01s]  He's being held by some bounty hunters.
[4018.01s -> 4021.77s]  Trying to see how much money the government will pay them.
[4021.77s -> 4025.53s]  I know he's in Blackwater, but there's talk of them moving.
[4026.25s -> 4027.13s]  We'll get a second here.
[4027.13s -> 4028.73s]  I'm going to update you guys on the green screen.
[4031.40s -> 4033.48s]  Well, then we're dead men for sure.
[4033.48s -> 4034.60s]  Well, we've been live for about an hour.
[4034.60s -> 4036.04s]  There'll be bankertons all over the place.
[4036.04s -> 4037.80s]  But if he's alive, we've got to try.
[4037.80s -> 4038.84s]  Updates on how that's going to happen.
[4038.84s -> 4039.32s]  Yeah, of course.
[4040.20s -> 4041.88s]  It's you they want, Dutch.
[4041.88s -> 4042.84s]  Always is.
[4043.80s -> 4046.36s]  Charles, go find out what you can.
[4046.36s -> 4047.24s]  Carefully.
[4047.24s -> 4049.40s]  Josiah, take Javier.
[4049.40s -> 4052.20s]  Arthur, go get yourself cleaned up.
[4052.20s -> 4053.48s]  Join them when you're ready.
[4054.04s -> 4055.00s]  What about me?
[4056.44s -> 4057.79s]  Well, exactly.
[4057.79s -> 4058.67s]  What about you?
[4059.23s -> 4060.19s]  What does that mean?
[4063.39s -> 4064.19s]  Oh no, never mind.
[4071.63s -> 4073.95s]  Okay, so let's talk for a second.
[4075.15s -> 4077.07s]  So if you missed the stream.
[4077.07s -> 4078.91s]  Let me just put the camera on because we're here.
[4079.71s -> 4082.35s]  If you missed the stream from three or four days ago or so.
[4083.47s -> 4087.31s]  My plan was because we were having a bunch of internet problems and we still are.
[4087.31s -> 4088.59s]  It's not completely fixed yet.
[4089.39s -> 4092.35s]  So wait, is this my my desync here?
[4093.15s -> 4093.88s]  I might be.
[4106.27s -> 4107.47s]  Let me sync this up.
[4117.82s -> 4118.22s]  All right.
[4119.18s -> 4121.80s]  Come on out here thing.
[4121.80s -> 4122.28s]  There we go.
[4124.70s -> 4125.02s]  All right.
[4125.02s -> 4131.53s]  So because the beard's growing, I haven't had time to shave.
[4134.68s -> 4135.48s]  It should be good now.
[4136.04s -> 4141.00s]  But anyways, because of the internet problems, my plan was if we didn't get it back,
[4141.00s -> 4144.44s]  I was going to desperately try to get the green screen stream done like tomorrow.
[4144.44s -> 4149.56s]  But now that they're actually working on the infrastructural problems that were in this area,
[4150.68s -> 4153.32s]  I think I'll be able to stream now.
[4153.32s -> 4156.04s]  I don't quote me on that, but like I did just say it.
[4157.16s -> 4158.44s]  This has been green here for a while.
[4158.44s -> 4159.24s]  No drop frames.
[4159.24s -> 4160.52s]  It's looking all right for now.
[4161.56s -> 4165.40s]  So the green screen stream, if you don't know what I'm talking about,
[4165.40s -> 4167.48s]  I'm going to get in front of a green screen for like an hour or two,
[4167.48s -> 4171.56s]  and I'm going to do a bunch of actions that you guys ask for and that we vote on.
[4172.28s -> 4174.04s]  But here's how I'm changing it though.
[4174.60s -> 4178.06s]  Because I'm including props, you know,
[4178.06s -> 4180.46s]  I'm only going to we're going to set it up properly in a couple of sections.
[4180.46s -> 4183.74s]  Like you'll be voting for props, you know, prop actions.
[4183.74s -> 4189.02s]  You'll be voting for regular actions because every prop action will just win.
[4189.02s -> 4193.26s]  And I'll have to spend like five grand on like two day Amazon stuff.
[4193.90s -> 4197.50s]  So we're definitely we're definitely going to have to split it off into different sections.
[4197.50s -> 4199.18s]  So you have to vote for your favorite one.
[4200.06s -> 4202.32s]  This is such a good idea.
[4202.32s -> 4203.44s]  It's going to be a lot of fun.
[4204.00s -> 4206.16s]  So we're not doing that like tomorrow,
[4206.16s -> 4208.88s]  because I need some more time to go through and section these off.
[4208.88s -> 4212.80s]  And I'm going to present in the Discord a series of polls.
[4213.36s -> 4214.72s]  We're going to vote on them.
[4214.72s -> 4218.88s]  This is not I'm going to I'm going to try to get this done from tonight into tomorrow.
[4218.88s -> 4222.48s]  And I'd say by this weekend, you'll have a poll to vote on,
[4222.48s -> 4224.00s]  but with three different sections in it.
[4224.56s -> 4230.08s]  And then I'll be streaming periodically, hopefully, if the internet stays fine.
[4231.12s -> 4234.56s]  Expect now that the streams are able to happen from here.
[4234.56s -> 4237.60s]  We'll push this forward a little bit so people have time to participate.
[4238.56s -> 4242.08s]  And we'll get that stream probably going next week,
[4242.08s -> 4244.08s]  like probably like six or seven days from right now.
[4245.61s -> 4249.21s]  I have a studio that I'm currently in contact with and working with.
[4249.21s -> 4250.73s]  So it is it's happening.
[4250.73s -> 4252.73s]  We just need some more time to get it prepared.
[4253.37s -> 4255.34s]  Because I know I'm going to need to buy props,
[4255.34s -> 4257.34s]  and that's going to take at least two days to get that stuff here.
[4258.30s -> 4260.70s]  So hopefully, that's a decent update.
[4260.70s -> 4262.54s]  It's no longer a secret anymore, by the way,
[4262.54s -> 4264.70s]  because I need to know what props I have to get.
[4265.58s -> 4267.98s]  So that this is the whole secret thing.
[4267.98s -> 4270.94s]  Like, I'm not going to know is that's not happening anymore.
[4270.94s -> 4273.34s]  So I'll be in there browsing and perusing.
[4273.34s -> 4275.10s]  And JabbaDab just gave five more subs.
[4276.00s -> 4277.52s]  Five community subs from JabbaDab.
[4278.08s -> 4280.81s]  Thank you.
[4280.81s -> 4282.41s]  Can't you just paint one of your rooms green?
[4282.41s -> 4283.93s]  Oh, I mean, well, I could.
[4284.01s -> 4285.45s]  But you have to remember something.
[4285.45s -> 4288.25s]  A green screen studio is like 50 feet up and down.
[4288.89s -> 4291.29s]  If I were to paint a room back here,
[4291.29s -> 4295.13s]  it would just be like by it would be impossible to do,
[4295.13s -> 4297.53s]  let's say me sprinting and sliding into home base.
[4298.25s -> 4301.45s]  I wouldn't be able to do that with an actual studio.
[4301.45s -> 4306.89s]  I'll be able to do large scale movements, full body, feet, everything.
[4306.89s -> 4307.69s]  It will be keyed out.
[4309.16s -> 4312.20s]  And thank Kazzy 101 just gave five community subs here.
[4312.20s -> 4312.60s]  Thank you.
[4314.86s -> 4315.74s]  Here's another one.
[4317.88s -> 4318.84s]  Thank you so much, guys.
[4318.84s -> 4319.56s]  Both of you.
[4319.56s -> 4320.28s]  Five in a row here.
[4320.28s -> 4320.84s]  Five in a row.
[4322.81s -> 4323.05s]  Yeah.
[4323.05s -> 4325.21s]  So like you'll be able to see full body,
[4325.21s -> 4328.09s]  complete green over like a 40 or 50 foot space.
[4328.97s -> 4330.49s]  It professionally lit.
[4330.49s -> 4335.32s]  It'll be perfect because you either go hard or go home with this.
[4335.32s -> 4335.88s]  You know what I'm saying?
[4335.88s -> 4337.88s]  Like, I don't want to put like just a green screen behind me
[4337.88s -> 4339.88s]  and like do five Fortnite dances.
[4339.88s -> 4340.92s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[4340.92s -> 4343.08s]  Like, there's going to be a lot of shit
[4343.08s -> 4344.28s]  that I'm going to do in front of this camera.
[4345.08s -> 4349.28s]  But regardless, that's kind of the update with that situation.
[4349.28s -> 4350.56s]  We're going to do that probably next week.
[4351.28s -> 4353.68s]  Give some more time to get more suggestions
[4353.68s -> 4354.96s]  and for me to make some polls
[4354.96s -> 4358.40s]  and you will hear about it again over the coming couple of days.
[4358.40s -> 4359.28s]  Here we go.
[4359.28s -> 4359.60s]  Okay.
[4361.21s -> 4362.65s]  Back to John Marston.
[4362.65s -> 4363.45s]  Or no, Arthur.
[4364.41s -> 4364.65s]  All right.
[4364.65s -> 4366.01s]  Multiple missions are available in the camp.
[4366.01s -> 4367.85s]  These are shown as the, that thing.
[4368.81s -> 4370.00s]  All right.
[4370.00s -> 4371.60s]  I need to take, maybe I should take a bath.
[4372.40s -> 4376.84s]  Can we have a peek at the recommendations?
[4376.84s -> 4377.64s]  You can go look at it right now.
[4378.12s -> 4378.92s]  You got your act together.
[4378.92s -> 4380.20s]  There's a channel in the discord.
[4380.20s -> 4380.92s]  I don't need to warn you again.
[4381.56s -> 4384.20s]  That is, I don't have anything in my, okay.
[4384.20s -> 4386.92s]  Well, just please can I, I don't want to kind of aim weapon.
[4387.72s -> 4388.52s]  Browse catalog.
[4388.52s -> 4389.96s]  No more nonsense from you.
[4389.96s -> 4391.48s]  Here's the catalog.
[4391.48s -> 4393.72s]  There's a green screen discord channel.
[4393.72s -> 4394.22s]  Okay.
[4394.84s -> 4397.32s]  Ammunition, hunting and fishing, horse care, clothing.
[4397.32s -> 4397.82s]  Here we go.
[4399.88s -> 4401.48s]  Clothing department, outfits.
[4401.48s -> 4402.44s]  Let's take a look at the outfits.
[4406.52s -> 4408.28s]  No, 85 bucks.
[4411.64s -> 4413.56s]  The Valentine, 113.
[4413.56s -> 4414.12s]  It's locked.
[4415.31s -> 4417.07s]  Custom tailored apparel of distinction.
[4417.07s -> 4417.87s]  That one's not bad.
[4419.88s -> 4421.64s]  The Dewberry Creek.
[4422.44s -> 4424.12s]  I ain't going to stay patient forever.
[4424.12s -> 4425.08s]  Get down to business.
[4426.51s -> 4428.35s]  Uh, dude, please.
[4430.35s -> 4431.31s]  Worn flat cap.

[12996.30s -> 12999.98s]  but i want to test out its speed zero to sixty
[13005.56s -> 13009.40s]  this is quick i just hope i can remember how to get there
[13009.40s -> 13013.40s]  back into the mountains i sure didn't figure on that
[13013.40s -> 13018.08s]  but this time we're doing the chasing i fucking hate the tail
[13018.08s -> 13023.36s]  why so how are things with you and what's wrong with it
[13023.36s -> 13027.04s]  i mean it kind of looks like a scorpion tail but that's fine
[13027.04s -> 13031.20s]  i'll say it he ditched us for a goddamn
[13031.20s -> 13036.32s]  youth i've spoken to him many times he knows he did wrong
[13036.32s -> 13039.04s]  he just wants to put it behind the tail is fine
[13039.04s -> 13043.20s]  i'm sure he does it just looks like there's a snake up its ass
[13043.20s -> 13047.12s]  is one thing but there's a cold he knows that
[13047.12s -> 13051.44s]  he ain't trolling dungeon you pretty much raised
[13051.44s -> 13057.08s]  i know but it's done has been for a while now
[13057.08s -> 13061.16s]  if it dies i lose it forever well then that's
[13061.16s -> 13068.46s]  very good reason for me to keep it alive
[13068.46s -> 13080.49s]  long hair it's the color not the braid get
[13080.49s -> 13088.57s]  gold okay time to go i think we need to head right up here
[13088.57s -> 13100.92s]  we're gonna go up all the way up yes i remember
[13100.92s -> 13105.80s]  i'm not in control anymore am i
[13106.04s -> 13114.51s]  what's what's wrong with my golden tail red hair
[13114.51s -> 13120.75s]  do i prefer flathead screwdriver or phillips well depends on what the
[13120.75s -> 13133.72s]  scenario is we made it let's loop around the other side
[13133.72s -> 13137.00s]  you can't have a favorite screwdriver depends on how big it is you know this
[13137.00s -> 13140.60s]  this screwdriver is a phillips head i can't undo my table without a
[13140.60s -> 13142.68s]  phillips head might as well go get a flathead
[13142.68s -> 13147.07s]  no i mean phillips head definitely is cooler but
[13147.07s -> 13162.17s]  did i do cinematic centrist streamer is scared to take a side
[13162.17s -> 13166.73s]  maybe we should catch one to cook sure try and shoot one
[13166.73s -> 13170.89s]  you don't want to use anything too powerful on a small animal like that
[13170.89s -> 13176.49s]  just ruin the meat you can probably put a paint can with a flathead
[13176.49s -> 13185.15s]  you can probably put a paint can with a hammer as well
[13185.15s -> 13190.76s]  slow down well there they all are i did i thought that we were still in a
[13190.76s -> 13223.72s]  cut scene why don't they just i got one
[13223.80s -> 13234.00s]  not very smart rabbits i will say you are correct on that
[13238.52s -> 13242.91s]  that's it we should camp here oh i thought we were going home
[13242.91s -> 13257.28s]  now that's it get it set up well i'm finished
[13257.28s -> 13262.96s]  cook that rabbit then they're delicious on an open fire like this
[13262.96s -> 13269.13s]  just like monster hunter right to spin it however i've been in this menu
[13269.13s -> 13271.76s]  it's just teaching me how to be in the menu
[13271.76s -> 13288.89s]  and cook six of this plain game let's go can i burn it
[13288.89s -> 13294.94s]  i don't like eating this late okay after all that
[13294.94s -> 13298.78s]  so i'm gonna eat a whole rabbit myself i guess i probably could do that
[13298.78s -> 13322.14s]  i could probably eat a whole rabbit put this one away
[13322.14s -> 13326.64s]  rabbits are 30 pounds are you sure about that
[13326.64s -> 13339.77s]  no they're not 30 pounds is is like a medium-sized dog a rabbit is like
[13339.77s -> 13348.30s]  maybe two pounds this isn't a shibu inu what do they call
[13348.30s -> 13359.88s]  is shiba shiba inu a rabbit is how many
[13359.88s -> 13364.83s]  pounds is a rabbit siri how many pounds is a rabbit how
[13364.83s -> 13375.32s]  much does a rabbit weigh how much does a rabbit weigh okay let's see
[13375.32s -> 13378.60s]  ranging from adult domestic rabbits can have a healthy weight ranging from
[13378.60s -> 13397.60s]  two to eleven pounds two pounds eleven pounds that's huge
[13397.60s -> 13401.28s]  that's a hare that's not even a rabbit first like to find this
[13401.28s -> 13408.65s]  monster choose time to sleep until sleep until morning
[13408.65s -> 13416.20s]  he better be worth all this drama eleven pound
[13416.20s -> 13427.77s]  absolute unit rabbit five five you ready
[13427.77s -> 13436.96s]  oh give me a minute coffee sure there you go
[13436.96s -> 13441.44s]  so what's your plan well we'll see if we can track them
[13441.44s -> 13444.64s]  but we might need to lay bait to draw them out
[13444.64s -> 13447.52s]  i want one of those cups obviously but they all can you get one of those one
[13447.52s -> 13450.80s]  of those old school tin cups i'll drink out of that every day
[13450.80s -> 13453.92s]  shoot from the trees but i prefer to hunt on the ground
[13453.92s -> 13457.84s]  more dangerous but we'll have a much better chance of getting
[13457.84s -> 13461.68s]  good shot in and if he bolts we can start right off after
[13461.68s -> 13465.92s]  why is my author arthur santa because halloween was yesterday and now

[13477.13s -> 13481.21s]  predator bait it's like the potent predator bait recipe
[13481.21s -> 13485.29s]  who's arthur that was virtually weaned on bear meat
[13485.29s -> 13492.59s]  okay i think i got this done good pack up and we'll get going i gotta

[13519.36s -> 13523.52s]  you know i was in this area with bessie
[13523.52s -> 13529.87s]  years ago really i don't i imagine you still miss her
[13529.87s -> 13534.03s]  every day did you two ever think about
[13534.03s -> 13538.27s]  fix the audio hold on is it really like an audio syncing problem right
[13538.27s -> 13541.15s]  now or am i getting yelled at for no reason
[13541.15s -> 13545.34s]  you should be hearing like dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
[13545.34s -> 13561.79s]  do a test with the gun this is a better test right when you see the
[13561.79s -> 13573.77s]  highlight it should go it's a half second behind it wasn't
[13573.77s -> 13590.52s]  it normal the beginning of the stream the audio is playing first hold on
[13590.52s -> 13602.65s]  let me try this that's weird tell me if this fixes it
[13602.65s -> 13618.03s]  already i wonder why that happened that's weird
[13618.03s -> 13622.11s]  because it wasn't doing that in the beginning i don't know why i'm
[13622.11s -> 13624.59s]  just desyncing after playing for like three or four
[13624.59s -> 13634.84s]  hours it's weird okay let's go now we did briefly

[13651.80s -> 13655.96s]  truth is there's never really any getting out
[13656.44s -> 13660.28s]  audio is at the wrong angle i gotta like tilt my audio
[13660.28s -> 13665.26s]  but bessie and i made it work you thinking about getting out

[20149.42s -> 20153.58s]  there's a scenario same thing when gta man i would just be
[20153.58s -> 20156.38s]  in on mission and i would just drive full speed and hit triangle and dive
[20156.38s -> 20162.65s]  out of the car it was so fun to me i couldn't do it

[20188.40s -> 20191.84s]  make uh i'm gonna this is like the equivalent of when you go to a
[20191.84s -> 20194.56s]  restaurant and you just go there for some reason
[20194.56s -> 20198.80s]  you don't have any money and oh well you you owe 140 dollar bill to
[20198.80s -> 20202.96s]  the restaurant you're gonna go wash dishes now that doesn't happen if you
[20202.96s -> 20204.40s]  don't pay if you just sit there and you go to
[20204.40s -> 20208.08s]  eat for fucking free and you go well uh i could go in the back and wash
[20208.08s -> 20209.92s]  dishes and cut to you in the back of the
[20209.92s -> 20215.48s]  squad car tracks delinquents and reprobates like flies
[20215.48s -> 20219.76s]  and i'm not a feller to pass a quick judgment and i've been around
[20219.76s -> 20225.88s]  long enough to never sink to catch a sinner that's that trope
[20225.88s -> 20229.24s]  you're gonna be working in the back of the kitchen and i won't ask no question
[20229.24s -> 20234.33s]  there was no money so what is it you need why don't you
[20234.33s -> 20237.77s]  have a look at that poster on the wall over there
[20237.77s -> 20242.65s]  he's a low down huckster some poisoning folks with his miracle cure
[20242.65s -> 20245.85s]  from here to ansburg kill morton land in the rickets
[20245.85s -> 20248.17s]  without even pulling a trigger that's not the guy from the first game
[20248.81s -> 20253.21s]  sick satisfaction out of it filler over at the saloon says he thought he saw
[20253.21s -> 20256.09s]  him by the gorge straight north of here
[20256.09s -> 20259.93s]  you think you can bring him in the money's good
[20259.93s -> 20264.44s]  i need him alive though i want to make sure the women he just gave the
[20264.44s -> 20267.48s]  eyes like oh fuck i don't know what this guy playing
[20267.48s -> 20270.68s]  that's gonna be tough i'll see what i can do
[20270.68s -> 20280.01s]  well you know you're asking and we need him alive it's an important point
[20280.09s -> 20283.61s]  last on location of the bounty is marked with a skull
[20283.61s -> 20291.18s]  let's take a look he is far a 97 dollar bounty
[20291.18s -> 20295.79s]  let's go but before i don't have any money what am i talking about
[20295.79s -> 20302.32s]  buy some stuff i have a 97 dollar fucking person tab
[20302.32s -> 20319.58s]  because all the people i murdered is it worth buying a ps4 to play
[20319.58s -> 20322.83s]  this game well it's definitely worth buying a
[20322.83s -> 20325.23s]  ps4 in general because it has some of the best
[20325.23s -> 20340.86s]  games of this generation that is uh that is a fact
[20340.86s -> 20356.08s]  spider-man bloodborne i mean god of war list them list them all
[20356.08s -> 20362.64s]  two games i just named three games on the top of my head
[20362.64s -> 20365.76s]  i can't see that far good i can take this we can cut here
[20365.76s -> 20374.62s]  fortnight's on why would fortnight three those are three exclusive games
[20374.62s -> 20377.74s]  and by the way those three games i listed are arguably some of the best
[20377.74s -> 20381.84s]  games that come out in years bloodborne is the best game to come
[20381.84s -> 20386.28s]  out in like a decade you gotta get 10 years that's the
[20386.28s -> 20393.84s]  that's the one that's come out that's the one
[20393.84s -> 20398.32s]  the last of us oh god don't even get me started but bloodborne 10 years
[20398.32s -> 20411.82s]  all right hold on probably should get rid of the light get rid of the light

[21606.84s -> 21610.20s]  website to contact someone so someone would come out
[21610.20s -> 21612.20s]  but we couldn't do that because no internet

[21630.52s -> 21637.15s]  and i'll be honest with you the what ain't much different unfortunately
[21637.15s -> 21640.75s]  like 80 to 90 percent of the entire country
[21640.75s -> 21644.19s]  is is made up of about three or four different companies
[21644.19s -> 21648.27s]  and it's just pick your poison of the companies that
[21648.27s -> 21654.59s]  actually care and give lightning fast stable service
[21654.59s -> 21658.03s]  they're only in little bits and bobs in the country
[21658.92s -> 21663.32s]  horizon files for example i will i will shill and praise the fuck out of them
[21663.32s -> 21666.28s]  every time they're only in a few places they're
[21666.28s -> 21669.96s]  only in like the northeast and then some sections uh out like
[21669.96s -> 21675.08s]  they can new york maybe uh google fiber that's you can't
[21675.08s -> 21679.24s]  nobody can i have this theory that google fiber doesn't exist
[21679.24s -> 21683.32s]  and everyone like oh yeah this place has google fiber
[21683.32s -> 21687.39s]  does it anybody have it no it's just there
[21687.39s -> 21693.10s]  it's in the middle of like texas somewhere you have it
[21693.10s -> 21697.80s]  well i'm glad somebody does but there are like a handful of internet
[21697.80s -> 21702.27s]  companies that aren't just the big box like best buy
[21702.27s -> 21705.47s]  internets but it's it's almost impossible to
[21705.47s -> 21710.67s]  avoid them when looking for places i've actually seen a quite a few
[21710.67s -> 21714.99s]  people comment on this about well why did you why did you move
[21715.07s -> 21721.87s]  to a place that has bad internet it there i mean it's not like it was an
[21721.87s -> 21725.23s]  easy thing to be like oh hey i'm gonna move into a house
[21725.23s -> 21729.95s]  and before i purchase a house or before i sign a lease agreement
[21729.95s -> 21734.11s]  i'm gonna buy internet install it and test it
[21734.11s -> 21739.64s]  that's just that you can't do that that's impossible
[21739.64s -> 21743.00s]  all you can do is just check speeds and check on
[21743.00s -> 21747.80s]  you know low where where location wise and how new is the infrastructure and
[21747.80s -> 21750.92s]  you can't like go move into a house and then buy internet and test it and then
[21750.92s -> 21752.92s]  oh you know internet doesn't really work that well
[21752.92s -> 21756.28s]  uh please tear by lease in half it's like what
[21756.28s -> 21761.76s]  you can't do that hey dude can i mind if i stream at your house before i
[21761.76s -> 21766.14s]  buy it ask the neighbors or something well here's the problem with that
[21766.14s -> 21767.90s]  because there's so many different packages
[21767.90s -> 21772.94s]  right your neighbor might not even have remotely close to what you need
[21772.94s -> 21776.94s]  so if your neighbor oh yeah like can i test your internet can i knock on your
[21776.94s -> 21780.06s]  door and test your internet i'm like i'm sorry i'm a fucking weirdo i need to
[21780.06s -> 21785.10s]  oh yeah we have 25 down like two up that's not gonna be a that's not
[21785.10s -> 21791.64s]  gonna work you just have to follow speeds and
[21791.64s -> 21794.92s]  the speeds i mean before we had all these
[21794.92s -> 21801.21s]  issues we had we had a gigabit line that's a thousand down it's just a
[21801.21s -> 21804.33s]  question of trying to fit with like okay there's a there's like a
[21804.33s -> 21806.97s]  problem there's like an infrastructural problem
[21806.97s -> 21810.57s]  in this whole like there's like five or six areas
[21810.57s -> 21813.53s]  that have like these major that they're being like fixed and maintained
[21813.53s -> 21818.01s]  and maintenance and uh it seems like it's done you know
[21818.01s -> 21825.93s]  what i'm saying we're this is the first time i've had
[21825.93s -> 21831.04s]  like 6 000 up green light the whole night
[21831.04s -> 21837.53s]  but uh italics and i desperately desperately have been keeping on
[21837.53s -> 21841.05s]  top of this every single day it's actually gotten in the way
[21841.05s -> 21844.57s]  of a lot of other things that we wanted to do
[21844.57s -> 21847.85s]  because it's been every single day we've tried to get it situated and
[21847.85s -> 21852.97s]  fixed and updated and uh it is not uh nothing to do with
[21852.97s -> 21856.41s]  us trying to oh this is not streamed for like three
[21856.41s -> 21860.99s]  weeks so cross your fingers it seems like
[21860.99s -> 21864.97s]  the problem has been solved i hate to say that out loud because
[21864.97s -> 21867.21s]  tomorrow i might wake up and it might be off but
[21867.21s -> 21874.70s]  you know i can hope right anyways uh that's the situation with that uh

[22347.29s -> 22357.87s]  a screenshot let's see uh this is from this is
[22357.87s -> 22360.60s]  from tingy uh germa i've got some great news
[22360.60s -> 22364.60s]  recently just purchased my first house it's located in the boston area the
[22364.60s -> 22369.32s]  realtor told me it was used to be owned by a short old man who
[22369.32s -> 22373.08s]  used to yell a lot at his computer according to his neighbors apparently
[22373.08s -> 22375.32s]  just before moving out he also invited one of the neighbors over to
[22375.32s -> 22379.32s]  fake party or something he told me that he saw him outside as he got home
[22379.32s -> 22382.44s]  from work and invited him in offered champagne and made dumb jokes
[22382.44s -> 22384.44s]  i got this house for really cheap because it had
[22384.44s -> 22395.69s]  extensive deal anyways how do you move to vegas went smoothly
[22395.69s -> 22400.14s]  can't wait to see what streams you cook up in the future much love
[22400.14s -> 22404.01s]  yeah you had me for the first sentence and then i figured out what was going
[22404.01s -> 22408.17s]  on thank you tingy for the five bucks
[22408.17s -> 22410.81s]  thank you topac for the two bucks you gotta get one of your mods or
[22410.81s -> 22414.25s]  something to figure out why out the way to keep good vods from
[22414.25s -> 22417.45s]  getting deleted playlists or something it's awesome to have them saved
[22417.45s -> 22424.46s]  with chat yeah actually that um i just recently gave sort of the
[22424.46s -> 22429.12s]  go-ahead to that archive channel i talked to
[22429.12s -> 22433.44s]  the that archive channel briefly they've been re-uploading those
[22433.44s -> 22438.56s]  streams pretty much forever and while it's nice to have with chat
[22438.56s -> 22441.92s]  i know that i could probably highlight them and everything but
[22441.92s -> 22445.28s]  to be i would be completely honest with you here when you go to like
[22445.28s -> 22449.44s]  video the videos tab on twitch i kind of
[22449.44s -> 22452.32s]  i kind of like the fact that it's just the last like two months worth
[22452.32s -> 22456.24s]  of streams just because if otherwise it's it's
[22456.24s -> 22460.24s]  like just hundreds just scrolling down
[22460.24s -> 22469.63s]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of videos potentially
[22469.63s -> 22473.07s]  and they made an extension that you can save chat they're adding an
[22473.07s -> 22480.57s]  extension for it well i'll look into it and i don't
[22480.57s -> 22484.89s]  mean that as like the joking like bullshit thing that i say because
[22484.89s -> 22488.32s]  at one hand i know a lot of people already
[22488.32s -> 22493.52s]  go to that channel you know what i mean like most people are already
[22493.52s -> 22498.72s]  watching that channel and they're like oh hey by the way
[22498.72s -> 22502.08s]  like just don't even go there anymore i feel like that's there's a lot of
[22502.08s -> 22504.64s]  people that probably wouldn't even know that that was happening
[22504.64s -> 22509.31s]  and there's a ton of people that don't even watch this channel live
[22509.31s -> 22513.50s]  you know what i mean i i would actually assume a
[22513.50s -> 22518.64s]  a pretty large majority of people don't actually watch these live
[22518.64s -> 22521.04s]  or if you do you're here for a certain amount of time maybe you're
[22521.04s -> 22525.36s]  here the whole time however that may be but if you
[22525.36s -> 22528.64s]  only know about like oh i know that i can just watch the replays on this
[22528.64s -> 22530.88s]  channel and then you know what if i like just
[22530.88s -> 22534.88s]  randomly you just they just upload just stop happening on that
[22534.88s -> 22538.32s]  channel and then they just announce it like oh it's over
[22538.32s -> 22542.16s]  like yeah it's pulling back to twitch i feel like if it's not broke don't
[22542.16s -> 22550.97s]  fix it at this point right now and two months back with chat and then
[22550.97s -> 22555.71s]  after like the 60 days without chat
[22555.71s -> 22558.59s]  i mean i i just don't think there's anything i necessarily want to do about
[22558.59s -> 22567.37s]  it right now but um if there's an extension coming
[22567.37s -> 22571.21s]  out maybe it can be put on the side i really wish like
[22571.21s -> 22575.36s]  there was an easy way to do that without having to like
[22575.36s -> 22580.00s]  potentially like delete somebody's youtube channel that has like an
[22580.00s -> 22582.24s]  archive of hundreds of streams you know
[22582.24s -> 22586.68s]  and i would never do something like that we talked about it extensively
[22586.68s -> 22592.92s]  for a little while we'll see where it goes but uh
[22592.92s -> 22596.04s]  anyways let's let's keep going here we're getting to the end of this
[22596.04s -> 22601.44s]  section here just over midnight eastern time
[22601.44s -> 22604.48s]  but thank you topac thank you mazy kit for the one dollar it's probably a good
[22604.48s -> 22606.72s]  thing you didn't go to twitchcon because the line was so long that a
[22606.72s -> 22609.68s]  bunch of people didn't even get in also if you live under my bed or
[22609.68s -> 22613.90s]  something you can have google fiber what was i talking about i was talking
[22613.90s -> 22617.18s]  about uh vodz and how twitch deletes them
[22617.18s -> 22620.06s]  after 60 days and that there's a channel that has kept
[22620.06s -> 22624.35s]  pretty much all of them for the last couple of years at least
[22624.35s -> 22627.79s]  uh yeah i didn't go to twitchcon i had no plans to
[22627.79s -> 22631.47s]  i was in the middle of doing all this shit
[22631.47s -> 22635.76s]  there was no time to go to any conventions or any events
[22635.76s -> 22644.99s]  maybe twitchcon next year potentially i mean i'm gonna look close enough
[22644.99s -> 22648.64s]  we'll see i had i did hear that it was a little ridiculous though
[22648.64s -> 22652.64s]  and uh envious that you have google fiber thank you mazy
[22652.64s -> 22655.36s]  uh voluki thanks for the five dollars voluki hey jerma good to have you

[23377.21s -> 23382.25s]  month just because i don't think i i don't necessarily have the time right
[23382.25s -> 23386.89s]  now to do that they're there and i think with some
[23386.89s -> 23389.61s]  of this direction that i'm going to take the channel here
[23389.61s -> 23393.82s]  is uh well let's just let's just bring it up for a second
[23393.82s -> 23397.10s]  remember i told you guys about like the podcast thing that i want to do
[23397.10s -> 23400.30s]  where a one stream every like couple of weeks is
[23400.30s -> 23406.46s]  there's no game we just hang out for like three or four hours and just
[23406.46s -> 23412.41s]  chill talk about whatever the hell we want no no like oh i'm gonna have like
[23412.41s -> 23415.37s]  guests no just be us just hanging out every couple weeks
[23415.37s -> 23421.31s]  just that's all we do like a like a comb stream yeah
[23421.31s -> 23424.83s]  and portions of that comb stream could just
[23424.83s -> 23430.46s]  be you know going back and making sure i pick up the ones that i missed
[23430.46s -> 23433.02s]  that usually ends up that's usually what ends up happening anyways but
[23433.02s -> 23436.70s]  going into it without anything else uh it starts
[23436.70s -> 23439.50s]  that way and if we could like come up with
[23439.50s -> 23444.54s]  topics and shit to talk about i don't know i feel like i i like doing this
[23444.54s -> 23448.38s]  kind of thing but it feels this kind of there's
[23448.38s -> 23450.14s]  gonna be a lot there's gonna be changes
[23450.14s -> 23455.44s]  made to this channel uh not anything drastic but
[23455.44s -> 23460.60s]  i think i would much rather because let's be frank
[23460.60s -> 23466.43s]  the this is just the end of a stream right
[23466.43s -> 23469.63s]  very at the end of a stream the stream is over played red dead
[23469.63s -> 23474.09s]  and here we are doing like this whole thing right
[23474.09s -> 23478.57s]  i would much rather have this be a like a focus
[23478.57s -> 23483.74s]  like three or four times a month you know what i mean
[23483.74s -> 23487.10s]  instead of it being and i'm gonna use this word in quotes here
[23487.10s -> 23496.01s]  like tacked on at the end of a stream if that makes any sense
[23496.01s -> 23507.50s]  talking to chat comb cast comb cast oh god
[23507.50s -> 23511.18s]  but it wouldn't just be stream over sign there would be things to talk
[23511.18s -> 23513.90s]  about there'd be things to show and things to do
[23513.90s -> 23518.41s]  but i i much prefer that over oh how many how did i read that person
[23518.41s -> 23520.49s]  how did i read that i gotta make sure i read that you know i
[23520.49s -> 23523.61s]  it i don't i don't want it to feel like this rushed kind of tacked on
[23523.61s -> 23526.33s]  oh i got an hour to like blow through a bunch of people that gave me a shit
[23526.33s -> 23529.53s]  lot of money you know what i mean i'd rather it be
[23529.53s -> 23532.49s]  taking our time because people say dude when you do the bits man if you
[23532.49s -> 23536.33s]  just read right through them in 40 minutes it'd be fine but i like
[23536.33s -> 23539.93s]  talking about all this shit i like giving each one of these as much as
[23539.93s -> 23542.33s]  attention as i can and maybe we would make it a thing that we i just
[23542.33s -> 23555.79s]  we just did so a bit stream no no i mean like just
[23555.79s -> 23559.15s]  the hangout portion of the after streams is what i'm talking about
[23559.15s -> 23565.92s]  but that it wouldn't be something that would happen every other day it
[23565.92s -> 23572.41s]  would be you know once a week or once every other week
[23572.41s -> 23576.96s]  germ is designated give me money so i'll talk to you streams
[23576.96s -> 23580.81s]  and then on top of that there are i haven't really mentioned this
[23580.81s -> 23582.73s]  because i haven't really had an opportunity to be to be live for
[23582.73s -> 23587.85s]  more than like an hour or two but i currently all the all the
[23587.85s -> 23591.77s]  stuff that i've been talking about over the last couple of years
[23591.77s -> 23598.25s]  is is real now because at this moment right now i have a studio in vegas
[23598.25s -> 23601.93s]  that i'm going to be working exclusively with and it is a full
[23601.93s -> 23605.53s]  studio sound stages green screens and i've
[23605.53s -> 23607.21s]  already toured them i've already talked to them
[23607.21s -> 23611.29s]  multiple times so like all that shit that i've always wanted to do
[23611.29s -> 23615.93s]  is going to start happening so the stream is going to start to take
[23615.93s -> 23619.05s]  some different directions because that stuff is going to be available for me to
[23619.05s -> 23621.69s]  do and i want it i want something like
[23621.69s -> 23625.69s]  that to happen more potentially once a month or more
[23625.69s -> 23628.96s]  than once a month so dynamically we're going to have to
[23628.96s -> 23636.22s]  start to change how this stream is presented right
[23636.22s -> 23639.50s]  and we'll figure that out as we go it's not something that i i have no
[23639.50s -> 23642.06s]  oh yeah this is what's going to happen and this is this is final and
[23642.06s -> 23644.62s]  i'm never going to play red dead 2 ever again
[23644.62s -> 23652.27s]  green screen stream monthly we talked about this in
[23652.27s -> 23657.29s]  in depth about the direction that i want to take the channel and slowly over
[23657.29s -> 23661.87s]  time i'd like to make it a reality and the internet's
[23661.87s -> 23670.46s]  dying uh-oh oh we still live that was uh that was a
[23670.46s -> 23677.95s]  full-on that was a full-on drop there we're back
[23677.95s -> 23685.88s]  we're here uh just kind of shit the bed for about
[23685.88s -> 23693.66s]  two seconds there pause and unpause all right well uh that might that's
[23693.66s -> 23695.98s]  like that's like the curt that's like the curt why did i just the
[23695.98s -> 23698.46s]  first time i've heard that noise all stream
[23698.46s -> 23701.02s]  that's the first time i've heard that fucking noise the entire stream and it
[23701.02s -> 23705.34s]  just scared me uh anyways that's i think that's like
[23705.34s -> 23707.82s]  the curtain call here the cane is coming out to try to
[23707.82s -> 23711.02s]  drag me off the stage so let me let me get through the bits
[23711.02s -> 23716.28s]  quickly after we'll talk about this uh thank you uh
[23716.28s -> 23720.04s]  thank you to lucas for the 15 thank you lucas 7151
[23720.04s -> 23724.20s]  uh thank you 15 bucks is red dead worth getting an xbox or ps4 to play

[23738.70s -> 23748.32s]  of great exclusives so far uh i would i think it's if you

[23903.10s -> 23906.70s]  monthly fucking sign up paychecks from the
