[0.57s -> 13.00s]  All right, so with the remaining time that we'll have here, let's do some lists. Anybody have
[13.00s -> 27.90s]  any special requests? Because this was fun yesterday. Remaining time in quotes. Yeah, well, I mean,
[28.46s -> 37.05s]  I usually only stream for five to seven hours, depending. All right, let me get that on the
[37.05s -> 63.61s]  screen. We can find one. Snacks. Is there a snack one? Candy. Ooh, that's a good one. I'll do candy.
[63.61s -> 76.12s]  Anybody got a good candy one? Taco Bell menu tier. What? Do these even exist?
[80.82s -> 90.31s]  Do the Soulsborne games? This is easy. Yeah, I can do this one in my sleep. Do I even need to have a
[90.31s -> 102.17s]  tier list open for this? I could just say them. Dark Souls bosses. That's kind of cool. All right,
[102.17s -> 128.68s]  let's get, I want you to be able to see this shit. And window capture. Please do. And what's that?
[131.40s -> 147.22s]  What? How is that the window? That is not the right window. That is not the right window.
[147.22s -> 168.17s]  Oh, here we go. All right, so I'll do some quick. Do I actually go get a T or am I a faker? Ooh,
[168.17s -> 177.42s]  there is a Dark Souls boss one, is there? Yeah, we'll do this one first. Now, is this supposed
[177.42s -> 197.51s]  to be hard or which one I thought was the coolest? Hold on. I don't want to have any Hulu ads.
[205.24s -> 211.40s]  Bring this down. Holy fuck, there's so many. I don't even remember that this is too many icons.
[211.40s -> 220.04s]  I don't, I can't do this by icon only. I'm sorry, guys. This is like picking a champion in Dota.
[220.04s -> 238.25s]  I don't know. I don't remember who any of these are. Holy shit. Uh, well, how do I get this on?
[238.25s -> 244.33s]  I can't even get this on the screen. Do it one at a time. Okay, I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do it
[244.33s -> 255.27s]  really slow. One at a time. That's a decent spot for it to be right where you can see S. All right,
[255.27s -> 269.82s]  so let's get this off. Let's get me back on here like this. Hey, what's happening? Okay, um,
[271.78s -> 284.26s]  I have to change. Hold on. Why is this? This is fucked up. Okay, let me, wait, I'm not doing
[284.26s -> 306.06s]  this for cleanup detail anymore. That's a lie. All right, here we go. Uh, so this is, I don't,
[306.06s -> 318.55s]  who is this? Who is that? You guys gonna have to help me here. Clean my ears? Did, they should
[318.55s -> 333.67s]  be cleaned now? Who is that? I'm not gonna be able to do this. I'm gonna, I'm gonna find my
[333.67s -> 358.02s]  favorite boss. That's all that matters. Bloodborne's not on this list. Never mind. Okay, um, I'm not,
[358.02s -> 383.11s]  I can't do this one. What is this? Germania? Germania. All right, we'll try it. Give this
[383.11s -> 396.82s]  like that. Okay, so what is Germania? Germania tier list maker? Oh, Jesus Christ. It's like picking
[396.82s -> 408.95s]  a chip in a dota again. All right, who, were there really this many people? All right, I can do this.
[408.95s -> 413.72s]  The pencil doesn't even get a slot apparently. I can do this. I can do this. All right, let's go.
[413.72s -> 419.26s]  Now, this is not about how strong a character is. Remember, this is like who I think is the coolest
[419.26s -> 428.28s]  character. Not the strongest, just who's the, who's the best character. We'll go, Pac-Man,
[428.28s -> 437.69s]  it has to be somewhere at least at A, S, or A. Uh, the egg. What does Z mean? Let's put egg at F
[437.69s -> 447.46s]  for now. It's the spy, like D. Um, all the bia's have to be down in the same spot. Like they can't,
[447.46s -> 455.29s]  what, is one bia cooler than the other? This is a bia, that's not Mario, that's a bia.
[456.90s -> 464.39s]  Santa, I mean that's just Santa Claus, it's stupid. Elvis is just Elvis. Who is this? Oh, this is
[464.39s -> 484.44s]  Captain Old Bones. Up here somewhere. Danny DeVito. This is the chicken. The Easter Bunny, F. Like F,
[485.08s -> 491.21s]  like below F, like the pencil. Count Chocula is somewhere in A. Dick Dashley Richard is B.
[492.17s -> 500.39s]  The Magician is definitely somewhere in C. All the serial characters are going to be probably on one
[500.39s -> 515.11s]  list. Yeah, now I have to change this list a little bit. Yeah, because they're all stupid,
[515.11s -> 518.63s]  and they all go on the same. There's a complete different serial tier, I think,
[519.27s -> 524.52s]  and it's definitely like up here. Yeah, that's good. That's definitely, and then in the serial
[524.60s -> 534.14s]  tier I will determine who I think is the coolest. Baldcoin, probably, probably like F. Baldcoin
[534.14s -> 543.13s]  sucks. I mean it just glows, that's any one, so it's not fair. This is, it should be a president's
[543.13s -> 564.26s]  tier too. Dr. Roker is at least A. Orson Welles? Earthworm Jim A is the wine guy. Not a serial
[564.26s -> 571.54s]  character, but definitely cooler than like the egg. All like video game characters also have to,
[571.54s -> 578.14s]  besides Pac-Man, because you're up there. And yes, I get to put Pac-Man at S because
[578.86s -> 583.10s]  in the Smash Brothers games he's like a D, so he gets to go up there on mine.
[583.10s -> 598.18s]  He gets to be S in my one. Okay. What? Pac-Man belongs up there. All video game characters are
[598.18s -> 602.10s]  going to have to be on the same tier too, because this is a shitload of them. And all humans, all
[602.10s -> 609.80s]  real humans, I think should be on the same category too. All right, let's get it, I'm going to put,
[609.80s -> 627.42s]  I'm going to make it, let's call it humans. Because this D. F. Humans. Look, there are too
[627.42s -> 647.56s]  many like just real people. Why is it just a normal picture of his face? All right, who
[647.56s -> 661.03s]  else is just a regular person? Why is a spy on here twice? Oh, the PSVR absolutely goes up.
[663.77s -> 673.37s]  I love this character. A. Mime belongs down with pencil. What's going on? Why they're like,
[674.57s -> 682.78s]  everything's duplicated. What? Why are there three, four, everything's twice?
[687.93s -> 697.66s]  It's broken. It's all right. I can do it. All right, Burger Boy. Yeah, another big down here.
[701.05s -> 710.06s]  Miserable Mikey. Absolutely belongs up around. Well, hold on. Yeah, that's accurate. Speaking,
[710.06s -> 723.34s]  this needs to be moved up. Glue Man. Yep. Glue Man goes up to S. I'm going to put like at least
[723.34s -> 735.34s]  two. Is this a? Yeah, I can't tell. I think it is. The green screen belongs up there.
[736.30s -> 757.37s]  Can't be stopped. So this is just a human. What is that? B. B. C. D. B. B. B. C. B. D. B. What is
[757.37s -> 775.22s]  that? B. D. D. B. B. What does that stand for? Yeah, Batman. I don't, I don't even remember
[775.22s -> 786.20s]  making this. So it's down here. Bootleg Duck Dynasty. Yeah, Batman. Holy shit. All right.
[790.47s -> 801.98s]  The egg is already up there, right? No. The movie of the movies characters. Yeah, they belong up
[801.98s -> 810.78s]  here. The pencil is just in the pencil category because it's the pencil. Chicken belongs way up
[810.78s -> 817.74s]  here around B. Disco Diaper is probably B. Hitman is a, is a, no, Hitman. No, it's a character.
[818.62s -> 822.14s]  It's just Hitman. There's nothing special. It's just, Oh look, he's bald guy with the suit on.
[822.14s -> 828.17s]  No, get rid of it. What was that? It was a giant rat. There's two giant rats though. Which one's
[828.17s -> 851.59s]  cooler? There are two chickens. Where's the other chicken? There are two chickens. Where? On the
[851.59s -> 869.48s]  list? There are two eggs. There are two chickens and two eggs. Egg one. Chicken one. Okay, there
[869.56s -> 884.09s]  there are two eggs. Where's the other chicken? Who the fuck is that? Oh, that's Ma, that's Kyle.
[885.11s -> 897.48s]  Yeah, that character is pretty cool. Jack's Jerma goes up here. No, no, that's too much. What does
[897.48s -> 910.82s]  this say? Monopoly guy D. Wizard Mike is already up there. The mime's already up there. Dick
[910.82s -> 916.50s]  Richard's up there. Boo is up there. That's just a person. This is Gabe Newell. Where's Gabe? Gabe
[916.50s -> 925.22s]  Newell is already up there. Yeah, but B. Birdboy's there. I don't think president number seven,
[925.22s -> 933.22s]  whatever his name is. No, down there. This looks good. This is James Madison. I think so.
[934.76s -> 949.00s]  Granny from the Vumps. Well, okay, here, there is just like a Vumps. Let's just,
[949.00s -> 959.51s]  we can collectively use them. Chocula's under cereal. Let's just get all the cereal characters
[959.51s -> 974.84s]  out here. Tony the Tiger's there. Cheese Nips is up here. Oh, no, that's Cheese It's. Definitely
[974.84s -> 984.46s]  somewhere in S. Isn't this, this is the same, this is a different pose of the same person.
[989.69s -> 999.94s]  Frank Pizza? Frank Pizza is not that great. Not a human, though. Does Danny DeVito, all right,
[999.94s -> 1009.88s]  the two-person horse. I love that character so much. Human Lord Zaraxos, I mean, just because of his
[1010.20s -> 1027.00s]  lower quality. Needs to be somewhere up here. Another president, right? James Giraffe? James
[1027.00s -> 1039.93s]  Gar, oh, okay. Other presidents. Is Dr. Roker up here? Yep. This is another, another, yeah,
[1039.93s -> 1061.08s]  but he's already there. I think this is like Star version one. Winston is the, another one guy.
[1061.88s -> 1079.85s]  Are there only two cereal characters? Oh, there's what? Cheese Nips down there. There's so many
[1079.85s -> 1095.06s]  people. This is the Archmage. Let's see. Captain Crunch is, is double S tier. Yeah. Demon Grandpa
[1095.06s -> 1106.55s]  is pretty high for me. It just is. Demon Grandpa is like S for me. Mr. Sneak Man is probably A.
[1113.88s -> 1124.70s]  There's Paul Bearer, who would definitely be up around B. He's a classic. I don't know what this
[1124.70s -> 1143.78s]  is. Can somebody refresh my memory of what this is? No rewinds. Oh, ah, eh. There's the Apple.
[1145.67s -> 1156.89s]  Definitely down here somewhere. Easy Pete. Easy Pete belongs, uh, at least in A somewhere.
[1157.69s -> 1165.08s]  There's somebody with a diaper on. I don't know who that is. I swear to God, there's like 10
[1165.08s -> 1185.77s]  cereal characters. Did I only make like three? No serpents. All right, what about this is the
[1185.77s -> 1195.66s]  Anor Lander? Somewhere in, somewhere in A. I like this list so far, but I'm going to make a couple
[1195.66s -> 1201.72s]  changes. There's the Wirehead guy. I could recognize, I could recognize that vest anywhere.
[1206.14s -> 1212.65s]  See. Captain Crunch, there you are. You are a cereal character, but you are like,
[1213.94s -> 1222.97s]  one of the best characters ever. Benjamin Franklin is a pres, is a person, president,
[1224.07s -> 1229.98s]  but, uh, I mean, this motherfucker invented electricity, so you have to be up here.
[1230.62s -> 1243.19s]  Carl Griffinstede, uh, probably somewhere like around here. There's a lot of Cs, but there are
[1243.19s -> 1258.82s]  a lot of C list characters. The EMT. EMT belongs in the human category, but it's going to be like high
[1258.82s -> 1272.41s]  Z. Disco Diaper's already up there, right? I thought so. Yeah, right here. It's like two
[1272.41s -> 1286.31s]  different images. Okay, the movies that are up there. I don't know who this is. This Andrew
[1286.31s -> 1295.74s]  Jackery Jack. Eh, somewhere in D. The Heavy Weapons guy. Oh, okay. Probably should be right next to
[1295.74s -> 1301.66s]  the spy. That would make, that makes the most sense. Here is, uh, from Lethal League, Mr. Candyman.
[1302.46s -> 1311.69s]  I put you in the high Cs here. Anybody else that I didn't put in here? I don't know who this is.
[1313.54s -> 1327.98s]  I think that's a mistake. I don't think that person's on here. Sluggo, right? Did I get
[1327.98s -> 1338.73s]  German Moon? Not yet. Oh, and this is, uh, IRL, uh, 3D CGI Pac-Man. Right. We have
[1339.61s -> 1347.66s]  cartoon Pac-Man, but we also have like 3D CGI, like made for like the movie version of Pac-Man,
[1348.30s -> 1362.23s]  which I think is way better. Censored. Yeah, that character sucks. Danny DeVito is not up there.
[1362.87s -> 1377.59s]  He's just a fucking human. All right. I think that's everybody, at least on this list. I can
[1377.59s -> 1387.18s]  move some stuff around now. This is, this is most of them. The VR guy. Oh, that's the VR guy. I love
[1387.18s -> 1395.21s]  that character. Yeah, definitely belongs up here. Up here. Oh, nice. I'm not changing that. He's not,
[1395.21s -> 1404.46s]  he's not coming down for mess. Did I get this guy? Did he try another guy? I don't think so. No,
[1404.46s -> 1415.91s]  I did. All right. Who am I missing anybody? The PSVR is up here already. Yeah. There are two Danny
[1415.91s -> 1440.55s]  DeVitos. Oh, okay. Yeah. This one, one inhuman. Okay. No 30s milkman. If a 30s milkman belongs
[1440.55s -> 1446.89s]  down here anyways, doesn't matter. Now I have to make the real one. I can already tell you
[1447.53s -> 1463.50s]  it's going to look like this. No tooth goblin. So what we have available, two-person horse is
[1463.50s -> 1472.20s]  probably my moment. I don't know why I have an accent now. Missing German moon. Yeah, you belong
[1472.20s -> 1476.76s]  definitely like on B. All right. Two-person horse is my favorite character, I think, out of any of
[1476.76s -> 1494.94s]  them ever. I've made my final decision on this. The loom man, Pac-Man, Mr. Cheez-It, Steven Grandpa.
[1494.94s -> 1506.42s]  Yeah, but bring him down. He doesn't belong up there. Neither do I. Hmm. I think that's it for
[1506.42s -> 1523.16s]  the yeses. Then you got Earthworm Jim, Dr. Elker, PSVR. Hmm. Easy Pete, I think, stays there. Disco
[1523.16s -> 1539.26s]  diaper comes up. German moon comes up. I go down. Winston goes down very, very much so. All the way
[1539.26s -> 1556.92s]  down to Lake Sea. They're doing the same pose. I'm all right with this. Maybe, oh, hold on.
[1557.64s -> 1568.74s]  I would put myself in front of Gabe Newell, but I'm not going to do that. Okay. Miserable Mikey
[1568.74s -> 1578.26s]  comes forward. Annalander goes down. Mr. Sneak Band takes that place. Jake Richard goes down.
[1578.82s -> 1602.50s]  Okay, I think, I think that's it. Now it's, no, now it is, now it's good. I think I'm going to bring
[1602.50s -> 1616.02s]  the, okay. Yeah, I know. People are saying, oh, whoa, hold on. Gabe Newell, I mean, what,
[1616.02s -> 1623.88s]  Gabe Newell's not like the, besides like the VR headset stuff. Gabe Newell used to be like all over
[1623.88s -> 1627.48s]  the place, used to be like everywhere. He used to be on interviews and talking and he was like a
[1627.48s -> 1634.20s]  front runner in like the gaming industry. Now he kind of just does his thing, right? Did I get a
[1634.20s -> 1648.20s]  cut on my hand? Put Gabe in the human spot, but he's almost, he's almost like otherworldly. He's,
[1648.20s -> 1661.64s]  right? All right, if Danny DeVito is going to be down in the human spot, then, then he should too.
[1666.30s -> 1673.22s]  He is a human, just a person, but he's a person that's not a president. That's important. I'm
[1673.22s -> 1676.18s]  not done. Hold on, I got to move these around. Just, they're all, everyone's freaking out about
[1676.18s -> 1681.61s]  this. Just hold on. I'm going to fix it. Just hold on. Don't worry. It's going to be fine.
[1681.61s -> 1685.61s]  Gabe, Gabe Newell, just because you're on the human list doesn't mean you're like bottom tier.
[1685.61s -> 1688.49s]  It just means you're, you're a human and we have to put the humans in the right place.
[1693.51s -> 1706.09s]  All right. Where was I? B? B looks pretty good. B minus streamer. I'm a B plus streamer now.
[1707.74s -> 1721.72s]  All right, let's go see. Magician stays there. Orson Welles stays there. Candyman comes up. Wine
[1721.72s -> 1727.90s]  Guy replaces, hit the tree. The movies actually goes in front here. The egg goes up in front
[1727.90s -> 1734.63s]  there. Egg goes actually in front of the movies. Orson Welles stays there. The bumps take over
[1734.63s -> 1740.12s]  that spot. Candyman comes down. Wirehead moves over the spot that was occupied by the Wine Guy.
[1742.10s -> 1745.78s]  This is kind of just a person. So, you know, not, not that interesting with the characters.
[1745.86s -> 1755.59s]  Cool. And it's funny, but this context here, Winston goes down here. Benjamin Franklin.
[1757.99s -> 1778.58s]  Okay. I'm all right with this, I think. Orson Welles is a human, right? It is a human that's
[1778.58s -> 1788.46s]  not a president. In fact, all humans, all humans that exist in real life or have existed in real
[1788.46s -> 1801.35s]  life are going down here. And then we'll have, they'll have their separate list. Benjamin Franklin
[1801.35s -> 1814.23s]  has to come down here. All people that are real people. Shit. That means Dr. Ocker has to come
[1814.23s -> 1825.64s]  down. Captain Crunch is not a person. Captain Crunch is a fucking cartoon character. He's not
[1825.64s -> 1843.10s]  a real guy. He's a serial. Fuck. You're right. You're right. They have to be on the same playing
[1843.10s -> 1851.66s]  field. No, but there's the other serial. Where's Woody the Woodpecker? Whatever his name is.
[1853.00s -> 1859.34s]  The Cuckoo Bird. Hey, I don't see him down here. No, the serial characters don't need their own
[1859.34s -> 1865.82s]  list because this is where they belong. I'm removing the serial character list.
[1877.02s -> 1888.49s]  Okay. That's good. Remove the human? Oh, there are too many. I can't, I can't put, I can't put like
[1888.49s -> 1898.33s]  fucking James Madison up here. Like, no, they don't, they exist on their own plane. Two-person
[1898.33s -> 1904.97s]  horse is a human. That is a horse. That is a, no, it's not. That is two horse pieces.
[1905.69s -> 1915.96s]  Jerm is a human. All right. All right. I'm getting rid of that. I'll get rid of it.
[1920.41s -> 1927.05s]  I'm just, I am just categorizing people. Like, oh, you're a human. You're a serial character.
[1927.05s -> 1932.76s]  You're a cartoon character. That's not a tier list. That's just what are they? All right. I'm
[1932.76s -> 1939.45s]  getting rid of the humans. You go back here. You, I still don't think I would put you any higher than
[1939.45s -> 1951.67s]  that. But they, all the humans would be like C anyways. I'm gonna have to get them all in C
[1951.67s -> 1966.50s]  and then move them around. No, I mean, like, James Madison sucks. Like, the characters are stupid.
[1967.14s -> 1972.89s]  Both of these two presidents characters are filler content. It is the equivalent of a
[1972.89s -> 1989.03s]  filler episode of a TV show. Van Buren rocks. That's right. You can love the filler episode.
[1989.03s -> 1992.31s]  I love some filler episodes. It doesn't mean that they're not filler episodes.
[1993.11s -> 2002.94s]  They, they're filler episodes. That like sucks too. It was just like,
[2010.44s -> 2027.46s]  all the presidents are like down at the bottom here. Make the humans row F. No, that isn't,
[2027.46s -> 2040.54s]  no. Z is F. I'm changing Z to F. This is F. What are you doing? Excuse me. F. That is just F.
[2043.91s -> 2050.36s]  I'm just gonna remove the human tier. Star. I'm just, I'm, this is not final yet. Hold on,
[2050.36s -> 2057.93s]  everybody. No rewinds. Belongs in D. And then Orson Welles belongs probably up here. Okay,
[2057.93s -> 2072.84s]  let's get her to the human tier. Now we can work with this. Okay. Do you guys understand why I had
[2072.84s -> 2078.74s]  a human tier in the first place? Because now you're making me rate my friends. That, you
[2078.74s -> 2087.90s]  understand? Having everybody in the human tier. Oh, well, aren't they like MLC stealth? There's
[2087.90s -> 2092.94s]  definitely like cooler than boo. No, but boo is better than a talent. This is why I wanted to
[2092.94s -> 2127.03s]  avoid that. Star belongs up. You're making me rate my friends. I'm doing a friend tier. No, yeah,
[2127.03s -> 2131.05s]  that's Gabe Newell. Never mind. All right, the friends of friends. The friend, that's the friend
[2131.05s -> 2171.66s]  tier. What? Oh, fuck. What's going on? Hey, what's going on? Is that it? Okay. All right.
[2171.66s -> 2195.88s]  Now I'm going to rename this to D. What are you doing? What are you doing? D. Okay. All right,
[2195.88s -> 2212.68s]  so now I'm ready. We did B. I'm happy with that. C. C is, I think, pretty good. Friends. Doesn't
[2212.68s -> 2216.04s]  matter where any of them are. Doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. They're all friends. And they're
[2216.04s -> 2221.32s]  all cool. And I like, they're all fun. And I like them. Okay, cool. None of this list does not mean
[2222.12s -> 2228.44s]  however high anybody is, that they're cooler or liked more. This is just a non description list
[2228.44s -> 2236.44s]  of people that not from any particular order are just on the list. Okay, there you go. And I'm
[2236.44s -> 2244.15s]  going to put the friends down here because they are not, they are not part of this. They're,
[2244.15s -> 2251.62s]  they're down here. They, they're down there because this is like, this is the pencil tier
[2251.62s -> 2258.34s]  and this is friends. So they're just in a separate category. The pencil tier is not
[2259.30s -> 2266.18s]  part of A, B, C, D, S, D, E, F. Okay. It's just the pencil tier. The friend here is,
[2266.18s -> 2273.83s]  is not part of the, of this, of this stuff here. Okay. Now that we've got that situated,
[2275.11s -> 2298.73s]  A, B, A, B, C, D. Okay. D is going to be hard. I'm going to have to change some of this around.
[2298.73s -> 2314.26s]  Okay. This is going to be hard. They, they're all so bad. All the BS have to be at the bottom.
[2314.26s -> 2321.66s]  This is too many of them. Santa should, should be like over here. Maybe DeVito should be here.
[2321.66s -> 2325.58s]  Apple is like a little bit closer up just because Cheese Nips is like just a shit character, but
[2325.58s -> 2335.75s]  it's fun. That's another BI down here. Okay. I'm not, I don't hate this so far. All right.
[2335.75s -> 2362.06s]  Does anybody need to come down or up from F? Maybe the F. Okay. These are the, that's it.
[2362.06s -> 2372.06s]  It's done. I'm happy with it. This is D plus. I would put Frank Pizza in a D plus.
[2381.05s -> 2383.61s]  Vault coins probably at the bottom here. Not that I don't like vault coin, but
[2384.81s -> 2391.22s]  maybe up here. The apple should be up here. James, no, James Garfield is a president down here.
[2394.52s -> 2403.75s]  Andrew Jackereject is also a, also president, right? But the coolest one out of, out of all
[2403.75s -> 2409.91s]  the characters, because it's just, this is, it's like, I made him in Fallout. So it works. It
[2409.91s -> 2424.39s]  still works. Joop, Joop, Joop, Joop, Joop, Joop. What's going on? Where's Batboy? Down with pencil.
[2427.29s -> 2436.42s]  I do need to find out what the worst character that I ever is though. That's important. Okay.
[2436.42s -> 2455.90s]  Let's see. The Monopoly guy's got to come up way up here. I think that's all right. All right.
[2456.62s -> 2480.42s]  We did that. Looks pretty clean. The worst character ever. It's the mime. It is. There's no
[2480.42s -> 2488.50s]  context to this channel. There's no joke. At least these, like the sensor bar, Garfield,
[2488.50s -> 2493.30s]  Hitman. I played Hitman and it was fun. This is like a monster of a bunch of different other
[2493.30s -> 2499.86s]  characters that I had. Sluggo is, he's been around. The pencil sucks, but the Easter bunny. Oh,
[2499.86s -> 2502.74s]  it's going to be close. Okay. But the mime is not, what's the mime? This is a mime.
[2510.92s -> 2517.88s]  There's no joke there. It's just a mime. Every single character on this list came from
[2517.96s -> 2523.48s]  something or was made for a reason. This is another filler episode, but this is the kind
[2523.48s -> 2528.52s]  of filler episode that you tell your friends to skip. You say, don't watch that one. You can
[2528.52s -> 2539.58s]  just skip that one. Some filler episodes are great. That one, not so much. The pencil is,
[2542.41s -> 2545.13s]  I don't think the pencil belongs down here. I'm changing this category.
[2545.85s -> 2552.73s]  Let's look at that. Look at that. Look at how, look at that. Look through the eraser and the
[2553.69s -> 2558.68s]  length and the top. This is, that's a, it's a fun, that's fun. It doesn't belong down here.
[2558.68s -> 2575.30s]  It doesn't deserve its own category. I don't think so. Better than, it's better than a PM
[2576.02s -> 2593.24s]  and Danny DeVito and Sam and all the presidents. Okay. But who is the least worst character?
[2601.22s -> 2604.18s]  Just because I don't know who this is. I don't know. I'm going to put it down here.
[2618.18s -> 2630.76s]  No, but Hitman is just Hitman. I'm done. That's it. From the available characters. That's it.
[2630.76s -> 2644.84s]  Where does, take a screenshot. The pencil isn't in pencil tier. Yeah, I know.
[2645.56s -> 2667.24s]  It's missing key characters, but we, but I still did it. There. Just terrible.
[2667.24s -> 2675.06s]  Demon Lord's Araxas should not be grouped up with the mortals.
[2680.76s -> 2694.09s]  That's fine. Where's the snack one? Where's the next one? Snacks? Cereals? Oh, fuck yeah.
[2694.09s -> 2712.42s]  Cereals. Let's do cereals. Oh, fuck yeah. Does this have them all? I don't, I don't think it has
[2712.42s -> 2725.56s]  them all. Let me, let me, let me, let me, let me sniff this list for a second. No. Is there a
[2725.56s -> 2742.92s]  better one? Is there one with more? Is there one with more? This one best cereals? Is this one
[2742.92s -> 2759.70s]  better? All right. That's, that's more. That's better. Okay. I think I'm ready. All cereals.
[2759.70s -> 2770.49s]  There's, there's another one. I can't right click it. I can't click it. I can't click it. I got it.
[2770.49s -> 2811.16s]  All right. Hold on. Everybody relax. Hold on. This is all serious. Oh my God. S S S A B C D
[2812.12s -> 2819.90s]  Probably trash. What is that? Why? Why? How would that not be? Never had it. You're just guessing.
[2819.90s -> 2828.74s]  You're just saying that it's trash. I never had this before. Well, I also think that's trash.
[2828.74s -> 2837.38s]  That's not how it works. I'm deleting this one. Like, no, that's, that's, I've never had it
[2837.38s -> 2848.55s]  or it's trash. Here we go. Oh, this is a shredded wheat. Never had this. Shredded wheat. No, I never
[2848.55s -> 2854.95s]  had it. Frosted chocolate strawberry. I never had it. When it's going to go when, as they come in.
[2855.59s -> 2862.20s]  Frosted chocolate strawberry. Frosted shredded wheat chocolate. Shredded wheat. Shredded wheat.
[2862.84s -> 2873.50s]  Shredded wheat. Cheerios on crunch. Oat crunch. I've never had it. Cookie crisp. Now is this 1996
[2873.50s -> 2887.50s]  cookie crisp or is this 2019 cookie crisp? That's a big difference. 1995 cookie crisp is up here.
[2888.22s -> 2895.22s]  2019 cookie crisp is down here. I'm going to assume by the box art that this is like later,
[2895.22s -> 2907.83s]  like 2010 plus. Belongs down here. Maple bacon donuts. Who the fuck buys that cereal?
[2908.39s -> 2915.96s]  I don't think anyone's ever purchased that. Why would you buy that? Maple bacon donut cereal.
[2916.52s -> 2924.04s]  That's like between Captain Crunch, Cheerios. So you got Cheerios, Captain Crunch, Lucky Charms,
[2925.32s -> 2935.32s]  like Raisin Bran. Maple bacon donut. That's, you never, why would you pick this one? I've never,
[2935.32s -> 2942.70s]  no it's probably trash. Chicken and waffles. What are these? This is the same bullshit.
[2944.22s -> 2949.18s]  People might think this is unpopular opinion here. This is the same bullshit of potato chip
[2949.18s -> 2955.26s]  flavorings. Are we going down that road with cereals now? Oh this is ketchup mustard pickles
[2955.26s -> 2963.37s]  and dipped in acid and fiery red tomato. No, like I don't want that. Just give me fucking sour
[2963.37s -> 2974.73s]  cream and onion. Well this is mesquite barbecue chili lime bacon. All right. This is BLT flavored
[2974.73s -> 2983.98s]  potato. This is BLT flavored potato chips. That makes no sense. So it's a it's a mayonnaise and
[2983.98s -> 2995.00s]  lettuce flavored potato chip. Oh yeah you get the chicken and waffles cereal. We're going too far.
[3000.86s -> 3013.93s]  This cereal is called Good Friends. Cocoa Puffs. I'm gonna start at a B. Put it on the friend tier.
[3017.56s -> 3024.12s]  Wheaties. I don't buy, I don't buy Wheaties. I don't read Wheaties. Reese's Buffs.
[3025.22s -> 3031.72s]  See you later. Trix. See you later. Alphabet's never had it. These are apple cinnamon Cheerios.
[3031.72s -> 3036.82s]  They're okay. Apple cinnamon toast crunch. It's a fucking dumb potato chip flavoring.
[3043.32s -> 3057.54s]  Banana nut Cheerios. That sounds pretty good. Boo Berry. Up at B. Chips Ahoy. I've had it a
[3057.54s -> 3070.07s]  couple times but it was all right. Cinnamon toast crunch is god tier. Yes. Apple cinnamon toast
[3070.07s -> 3088.90s]  crunch is not god tier. Have you had it? I've had it. I've had it. Why is apple cinnamon Cheerios
[3088.90s -> 3095.30s]  C tier? Because that's Cheerios with apple cinnamon. This is this is fucking french
[3095.30s -> 3099.46s]  toast with cinnamon and apples on it. Which is actually fucking really really good.
[3106.10s -> 3121.77s]  Uh Kix. I used to love Kix actually. Kix and Pops. Is Pops on here? Blueberry Cheerios.
[3122.49s -> 3129.75s]  Now get this get this green ketchup. I don't want it. Shredded wheat. I don't I haven't I don't eat
[3129.75s -> 3136.97s]  these. Cocoa Pebbles. The thing about Cocoa, I'm gonna do both these right now. Cocoa Pebbles and
[3136.97s -> 3143.21s]  Fruity Pebbles. Um are we talking about the first 30 seconds? Or are we talking about the rest of
[3143.21s -> 3150.87s]  the time you eat the cereal? Because once you once you pour the milk in and you eat the cereal
[3150.87s -> 3156.50s]  it's like it's S. S. S. But after about 25 seconds it becomes something you want to just throw in the
[3156.50s -> 3166.84s]  trash. They just become hard boogers that you're eating. It's just individual boogers. That's what
[3166.84s -> 3175.78s]  they turn into. The shit that you pull out of your nose is what each every single pebble turns into
[3175.78s -> 3194.17s]  in about two minutes. I'm sorry but that's just I'm telling you how I feel. That's a big deal with
[3194.17s -> 3217.14s]  cereal. It is. Eat them dry. No eat them dry is like eating glass. No those can move. I'm just I
[3217.14s -> 3222.94s]  need to I have to see it first. Is this another one of those things where it's just it's doing
[3222.94s -> 3236.41s]  them all again twice? Why is it why am I happening to me? Golden Oreo. I've had Oreo always before
[3236.41s -> 3245.53s]  but not these ones. What's the difference? Marshmallow Fruity Pebbles. I'm gonna bump this up
[3245.53s -> 3253.62s]  just because. No I've never had it never mind. That sounds pretty good. Nilla. Never had it.
[3255.40s -> 3264.23s]  Nutter Butter Cereal. This is another thing with cereals is they just have they just put
[3264.23s -> 3276.22s]  cookies in a bowl. Cookie Crisp. Yeah I understand but I that's not that's not like good.
[3276.94s -> 3285.37s]  Putting putting like cookies in a bowl with milk on them. That's not a breakfast. Maybe that's why
[3285.45s -> 3296.41s]  they changed the recipe. Oreo Ore is they're very good though. They are insanely good. Peanut
[3296.41s -> 3303.08s]  Butter Fruity Pebbles. They're all gonna be on the same. They're not I can't get over it.
[3303.72s -> 3311.50s]  This is is this real? There's only one place you should ever put a Sour Patch Kid in your
[3311.50s -> 3320.28s]  fucking mouth and that's at a movie theater. A cereal for this shit. You better eat that at
[3320.28s -> 3335.88s]  the movie theater or there's no reason to buy that. Oh yeah that goes up here. They mass produced
[3335.88s -> 3343.64s]  they had to produce that. They had to been enough interest in that for them to make like 500,000
[3344.20s -> 3361.22s]  boxes of this. I don't need to taste it. Bran Flakes. I don't think we've ever had this brand
[3361.22s -> 3369.10s]  before. Honeycomb. I think I've had it a few times. It was all right. Cheerios Ancient Grains.
[3369.82s -> 3383.21s]  That's why that says ancient grains. Is that supposed to mean it's healthier because it's
[3383.21s -> 3391.62s]  using old spices or something? Or does it mean ancient grains like we've been storing them for
[3391.62s -> 3407.32s]  a long time? I haven't had it. Cheerios Protein. Never had them. Chex. I'm gonna have to I'm gonna
[3407.32s -> 3418.46s]  oh I don't buy Chex. I don't eat Chex. No. Belongs on the floor in your bathroom not in a cereal.
[3419.69s -> 3426.46s]  This tile motherfucking cereal. Get out of here. All right here we go. Chocolate Cheerios.
[3430.82s -> 3440.02s]  Um that doesn't sound very good but I haven't had them. Now this is Chocolate Lucky Charms.
[3441.26s -> 3451.21s]  I have had these I think once. They weren't as good as the regular ones. I like the regular
[3451.21s -> 3457.98s]  ones better but they weren't bad. We'll keep them here for now. Chocolate Toast Crunch.
[3466.63s -> 3472.95s]  That just doesn't make it. Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Chocolate Toast Crunch. What is Chocolate Toast?
[3477.08s -> 3485.08s]  Chocolate Toast to me is I guess when you when you Nutella on your toast or something.
[3485.72s -> 3495.22s]  Is that what it's supposed to taste like? Not for me. Cheerios Cereal. I haven't had it. Here we go.
[3495.22s -> 3508.10s]  Cinnamon Toast Crunch. It belongs up here. Nothing's est here yet. Not yet but it could be very soon.
[3509.83s -> 3518.31s]  Count Chocula is up here somewhere in C I think. Cotton Candy Crunch. That sounds disgusting but
[3518.31s -> 3525.51s]  I'm gonna buy it at the grocery store tomorrow. That sounds truly awful but I'm gonna get it.
[3526.07s -> 3533.16s]  Crunch Berries belongs up here and what what's with this? Wait oh this is the different trick.
[3533.16s -> 3539.93s]  Okay one of these tricks is I'm I know this. Okay so these the two tricks is one of them was
[3540.65s -> 3546.01s]  we want a healthier cereal and we want less dye in our cereals and we want it to be healthier and
[3546.01s -> 3552.02s]  no more colorings and make it like less sugar and then they did that as this one and and then
[3552.02s -> 3555.78s]  everybody had it and said no I don't want that give me the fucking colors back give me like the
[3555.78s -> 3561.72s]  sugar back and so they they ditched that and started doing the old one again. That's what
[3561.72s -> 3573.98s]  happened right? There was such an outcry about how gross and not colorful and not yummy and delicious
[3573.98s -> 3579.37s]  and sugary that this one was. The healthy one that everybody wanted. Give us a healthier alternative
[3579.37s -> 3586.58s]  to tricks. I want no food dye. Okay well here's one without food dye. Oh that looks like bird poo.
[3586.58s -> 3608.25s]  Give me the other one. I have never had it though. Fucking consumerists. Frank and Berry is it's
[3608.25s -> 3617.43s]  all right. I have two tricks is on the list. Yeah I know that that's the different the different
[3617.43s -> 3621.99s]  versions. This is this is the the new the one that the healthy one right. Go look it up that happened.
[3623.94s -> 3640.12s]  French Toast Crunch is better than Cinnamon Toast Crunch. In fact it might be the first S.
[3646.22s -> 3668.47s]  I think so. It's okay to be wrong. French Toast Crunch is insane. It's it's insane. It's really
[3668.47s -> 3677.98s]  good. That's really good. Cinnamon Toast Crunch is fucking good too. Cinnamon Toast Crunch is really
[3677.98s -> 3683.03s]  really good. I just think that French Toast Crunch is a little bit better. Just a little.
[3688.22s -> 3698.54s]  Cocoa Wheats. Never had it. Total. I've actually never eaten total. Frosted Cheerios.
[3699.50s -> 3711.61s]  Oh they're gross. I've had them a few times. It's not they're not good. They're not good.
[3712.25s -> 3720.92s]  Just eat Frosted Flakes. It's Frosted Flakes are better. They feel better in your mouth. They crunch
[3720.92s -> 3729.48s]  better. I don't like them. If you like them I'm glad you do. Maybe it's D-. I don't it doesn't
[3729.48s -> 3743.98s]  belong on like the movie candy box. Yeah but I'm not a big fan. Fruity Cheerios. Chocolate Peanut
[3743.98s -> 3751.53s]  Butter Cheerios. Haven't had them. Now here's a the issue here. This is Golden Crisp but where's
[3751.53s -> 3755.53s]  Smacks? Because they're the same cereal. One of them is just way better. And do you know which one
[3755.53s -> 3770.76s]  it is? Which one is way better? I'm glad we have some intelligent people in this chat. Smacks are
[3770.76s -> 3776.52s]  way better. So these are coming up at probably around like D plus C minus. Smacks are going to
[3776.52s -> 3783.21s]  be up at like B. Golden Grahams suffer from the same problem that Fruity Pebbles suffer from and
[3783.21s -> 3790.54s]  they get soggy in about 10 seconds. I have eaten Golden Grahams before and they taste great but
[3790.54s -> 3796.26s]  Golden Grahams are the worst offender for that. You will pour your milk on these fucking things.
[3796.82s -> 3804.26s]  Turn around to go get a spoon. Turn back around and it's porridge. It just did. I can't. I don't.
[3804.82s -> 3813.54s]  It's got to be crunchy. I don't eat cereal dry. I don't do that. But you have to do with Golden
[3813.54s -> 3819.24s]  Grahams and with some of these others. This is a tactic. I mean I did this a lot when I was in
[3819.24s -> 3826.92s]  college. Is you get a mug of milk and what you do is you have like a drinking mug. Take whatever
[3826.92s -> 3834.10s]  cereal you want. Sprinkle a little bit on the top. Like make a little top layer of cereal on top of
[3834.10s -> 3841.64s]  the milk in your cup and just like sip it and crunch it and stuff. Therefore you can keep putting
[3841.64s -> 3848.92s]  a top layer. Sip, crunch, top layer, sip, crunch. It works out really well. It's the only way I can
[3848.92s -> 3855.30s]  really eat those. Otherwise that's too much work. But then I get soggy cereal. I don't want to eat
[3855.30s -> 3859.46s]  that. Every time I get to the end of the... When you get like halfway down and it's just...
[3861.50s -> 3867.06s]  When your cereal goes like this, that's not good. You don't want to eat that. It's
[3867.86s -> 3875.82s]  it's not appetizing. Just eat it faster. No, you don't eat... What do you mean eat it faster?
[3877.54s -> 3882.90s]  No, you don't just wolf down food as fast as you can. I got to do this before I get soggy.
[3885.22s -> 3896.95s]  No, you want to eat and enjoy your meal. I don't eat cereal dry. I eat it wet with milk.
[3898.30s -> 3903.74s]  I usually put almond milk on it and that's not because I... That's a stomach and intestinal issue
[3903.74s -> 3908.78s]  that's not like a, oh I prefer whole milk. I just... I drink almond milk but I put almond milk on
[3908.78s -> 3923.69s]  because it's a stomach problem. Okay, okay. Lucky Charms Frosted Flakes. What? That's real?
[3924.70s -> 3937.99s]  Frosted Flakes Lucky Charms? I need to get these too. It's gonna... No way. I didn't make a new list.
[3938.63s -> 3947.98s]  I gotta add Roblo. This is called... This is gonna be the get next time at the grocery store list.
[3955.61s -> 3963.38s]  Yeah, like just order this. Wait, there's another one too, right? Okay. Any others on here that I
[3963.38s -> 3970.65s]  like... Do I want to eat? This is the next time I go to the grocery store. I'm gonna get these.
[3972.76s -> 3983.99s]  No, I'm not eating Sour Patch Kids. All right, Grape Nuts. I've not really had them. All right.
[3983.99s -> 3987.19s]  Honey Bunches of Oats. The only one I've had is with strawberries and it's very good.
[3988.15s -> 3996.86s]  I would put it somewhere in like high C, maybe low B. The rest of them I have not had.
[3997.50s -> 4004.33s]  Honey Bunches are good. Yeah, the Honey Bunches of Oats with strawberries. That's the one I've
[4004.33s -> 4014.07s]  ordered. The rest of these, yeah, I've never had them before. There's so many cereals.
[4014.71s -> 4022.14s]  Honey Bunches of Oats S'mores and Almonds. Get that. Kicks is already up here, isn't it?
[4022.70s -> 4032.01s]  Isn't Kicks already up here? It's just... What's the difference?
[4032.57s -> 4044.73s]  Honey Kicks versus what's this Kicks? Chocolate? Oh, no. I just had regular Kicks.
[4045.45s -> 4055.91s]  I've never had chocolate Kicks before. I don't know. All right, here we go. Time for a staple.
[4055.91s -> 4064.94s]  Here come the staples. Honey Nut Cheerios belongs up here. I would say Honey Nut Cheerios is...
[4065.66s -> 4105.22s]  There's so many options now that it's like hard to put that higher. All right. Where was I?
[4106.10s -> 4117.35s]  Honey Nut Cheerios Medley Crunch. I don't know if that is five or one. No. Honey Bunches of Oats.
[4117.35s -> 4121.27s]  This one, I haven't had it. Raisin Bran Crunch. Get that one. I've always wanted to eat it and
[4121.27s -> 4133.61s]  never have it. Frosted Flakes. They go up here. Just regular Frosted Flakes. No bullshit. Tony
[4133.61s -> 4143.32s]  the Tiger. They taste good. They're really, really, really yummy. They've been around for like 150
[4143.32s -> 4150.04s]  years. Like blacksmiths used to fucking eat this when they were making swords. So it belongs up
[4150.04s -> 4164.47s]  here. Crave. I don't think it's as high as A, but it's all right. Crave is like a little...
[4164.47s -> 4174.10s]  Crave is like a little disgusting though. It gets gross. Like anything that is filled with something
[4174.10s -> 4183.64s]  else. Something crunchy filled with this. It's usually... It's very hit or miss. I'm going to
[4183.64s -> 4190.63s]  put it below 2019 Cookie Crisp, I think. It's still good though. Still... And what is this doing all
[4190.63s -> 4203.27s]  the way down here? I'm going to put this one down because it's kind of taken up too much space.
[4203.27s -> 4214.46s]  You know that I haven't had these. Fruit Loops with Marshmallows. Man, they really are adding
[4215.19s -> 4221.80s]  marshmallows to everything, huh? Never had it. I don't really want it though. Frosted Crispies.
[4222.60s -> 4231.24s]  That's not the only SS tier that... Where is it? Is it on here? Where is Rice Crispy Treats
[4231.24s -> 4246.30s]  cereal? That's the highest on the whole list. It's mostly all cereals. There's no Rice Crispy
[4246.30s -> 4269.93s]  Treats cereal. Can I just pretend? Blind. Am I blind? Where is it? Rice Crispy Treats. It's
[4269.93s -> 4286.25s]  purple. Oh, fuck yeah. Rice Crispy Treats cereal is unstoppable. It is insane. What do you mean he
[4286.25s -> 4299.86s]  doesn't know? What do I not know? What's wrong with it? What's wrong with it? Rice Crispy Treats cereal
[4299.86s -> 4317.78s]  is so bad. No, it's not. So this is Frosted Crispies. Never had it. Apple Jacks is very...
[4317.78s -> 4330.09s]  It's very boring to me. It's boring. It's very boring. It doesn't do it for me. Now I've had
[4330.09s -> 4333.53s]  Frosted Mini Wheats. I've had the regular ones, just the default ones, which are these, right?
[4333.53s -> 4340.33s]  And they're pretty good. These I would eat dry. It's one of the only cereals I would eat dry
[4340.33s -> 4353.93s]  because you kind of have to. They're very good. It's good with milk. Yeah, I know it is, but I
[4353.93s -> 4370.10s]  would eat these dry. Why am I watching this? I don't even eat cereal. Cocoa Crispies last longer
[4370.74s -> 4387.66s]  than Cocoa Pebbles, so they're better. Measelicks. I don't know what it is. Frosted Mini
[4387.66s -> 4390.70s]  Wheats. I don't have, never had them. They're like little bites. Never had them.
[4392.04s -> 4398.76s]  Different flavors of little mini bites. All brand have never had any of these. Pops. Here we go.
[4400.52s -> 4431.99s]  The second of our S tier is Pops. Wait a minute. A Cracklin' Oat Bran. No, that's an old people's
[4431.99s -> 4439.82s]  cereal. Chocolate Frosted Flakes. I've never... Get them. Rice Crispies. They're too... That's
[4439.82s -> 4445.91s]  too default for me. I wouldn't... I would never... It's not trash, but I would never order them
[4445.91s -> 4453.48s]  because they're not... They're just too boring. Crispicks. Never had it. Some other weird version
[4453.48s -> 4459.32s]  of Crave that I've never had. Smart Start. Never had it. Raisin Bran. Belongs.
[4460.62s -> 4466.07s]  Somewhere up here, and I would say B. Not quite as good as a Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but it's still
[4466.07s -> 4478.97s]  good. Kicks. That's regular kicks, right? Yeah. This is just regular kicks, but these are great.
[4479.69s -> 4490.38s]  They're definitely at least A or B. I'm gonna put them in B for now. Any of these Maple Cheerios?
[4491.02s -> 4504.36s]  Mm-mm. Fruit Brute. Wait a minute. Hold on. There's an Oops All Berries. Get this. Is it... Is it
[4504.36s -> 4512.98s]  All Crunch Berries one? Oops All Berries. All right. I'm gonna put this in line of like where...
[4512.98s -> 4527.03s]  What I want the most. Captain Crunch is the best cereal. It is. It is the best cereal you can
[4527.03s -> 4535.53s]  possibly eat. There are... There are no other cereals that are worth eating more than just
[4535.53s -> 4547.94s]  regular Captain Crunch. None. Some of them come close, as you see. Not close enough. I just
[4548.58s -> 4556.28s]  teleport myself back to when I was like 12, and every one of those individual deep like earthy
[4556.28s -> 4562.62s]  corn tastes like starchy sweet flavorings. I know. I can feel it right now. I know what it
[4562.62s -> 4567.83s]  tastes like right now. I can taste it right now. Can you taste things in your head? I can taste
[4567.83s -> 4587.18s]  that right now. Perfect. I can... I feel it. Is it another one of those? Okay. Regular Cheerios.
[4587.82s -> 4597.37s]  I just don't... I want to... I don't want to... They're not bad. Look. I would put them high on D.
[4599.05s -> 4605.56s]  But they're... No. I don't... Look. You can get like... When there's... Okay. When there are
[4606.20s -> 4611.96s]  Honey Nut Maple Chocolate Frosted Oreos, why would you get the regular Cheerios? I don't know.
[4611.96s -> 4624.60s]  I mean, I guess they're... It's just... It's just cereal. Interesting. Because I'll like the...
[4630.50s -> 4632.66s]  I don't think I would even... If some... You know how people say,
[4632.66s -> 4635.94s]  oh, I wouldn't order it. But if you gave it to me and you're like, hey, you want a bowl of Cheerios?
[4635.94s -> 4641.19s]  I'd say, yeah. I don't think I would say yes. That's one of those scenarios. Like,
[4642.55s -> 4650.09s]  you got anything else in a very not disrespectful way. Oh, you want some Cheerios? Cheerios?
[4650.81s -> 4661.02s]  Like Mustard Box Cheerios? Or what are you talking about? Oh, yeah. Just Cheerios. I'm not a baby.
[4661.02s -> 4673.72s]  That's baby food. That's what babies eat. I'm a man. It's baby food. It's very good baby food.
[4673.72s -> 4681.93s]  It's really good for you. But I'm old. I'm too old for Cheerios. Or like the guy with the salt
[4681.93s -> 4689.03s]  and pepper hair that's sitting there eating the bowl, talking to what I assume is his like
[4689.03s -> 4694.47s]  five-year-old daughter. What are you doing, Dad? I'm just working on my cholesterol, honey.
[4696.31s -> 4699.03s]  And then the commercial ends. Doesn't matter. That's the whole commercial.
[4699.75s -> 4717.48s]  Those are the two scenarios. Which, by the way, I could tell you. I know that like, oh, eating
[4717.48s -> 4722.60s]  Cheerios every day will lower your cholesterol. But no, no, no. That's not what it is. It's eating
[4722.60s -> 4729.19s]  Cheerios every day and having a good healthy lifestyle could lower your cholesterol. Right.
[4729.19s -> 4739.26s]  Okay. Yeah. Hey, don't eat a Big Mac. You won't clog your arteries. Okay. If you stop smoking
[4739.26s -> 4750.68s]  cigarettes, you might be able to run faster in a couple of years. All right. That's good to know.
[4750.68s -> 4763.69s]  So be healthy. All right. What's the point? The point is that it's just like, eat lettuce
[4764.65s -> 4769.77s]  and be healthier and you'll be healthier. It's not the lettuce that's doing it. It's the fact
[4769.77s -> 4779.38s]  that you live in a healthier lifestyle. Just be healthy. Yeah. Cheerios. Just be healthy, forehead.
[4780.44s -> 4803.94s]  Replace the fucking heart here with like the forehead. Drink dried sugar. What is this one?
[4803.94s -> 4811.06s]  I don't know. What's this one? Lucky Charms Magical Unicorn. Is Lucky Charms on here already?
[4811.06s -> 4824.97s]  It's not. Is there like just a regular Lucky Charms? I don't see the regular Lucky Charms anywhere.
[4828.47s -> 4836.68s]  Well, I'm just gonna say this is regular Lucky Charms. What is the cereal string?
[4841.61s -> 4850.89s]  Never. Lucky Charms, you just avoid all the fucking cheerio bits and you eat the marshmallows.
[4850.89s -> 4859.30s]  Everybody does that. And you end up with like 30 to 40 pieces of soggy, just beige cardboard that's
[4859.30s -> 4862.66s]  in the bottom. And you just like, you don't feel bad. You're like, eh, I kind of feel bad I didn't
[4862.66s -> 4880.15s]  eat that. It's all right. Peanut Butter Crunch is also up here pretty high. I would say somewhere,
[4883.46s -> 4887.86s]  I think it's better than Crunch Bears. But is it better than Frosted Flakes?
[4887.86s -> 4906.81s]  They both are. Frosted Flakes belongs down here. Okay. Just making sure. All right.
[4909.19s -> 4916.68s]  Fruit Loops. Regular Fruit Loops. I'm like, have I blinked? My eyes are getting so dry and watery
[4916.68s -> 4926.23s]  and hard. That was a complete oxymoron. My eyes are getting really dry. Fruit Loops.
[4941.58s -> 4945.02s]  Better than blueberry, but they're not. They're okay. They're all right.
[4948.04s -> 4951.24s]  Multi-Grain Cheerios. Somebody said if I didn't put this at at least A, they were going to
[4951.24s -> 4960.84s]  unsubscribe. I'm sorry. I don't, I've had them a bunch of times. They're just, they're just
[4960.84s -> 4965.48s]  regular Oreos. No, why do I keep saying Oreos? They're just regular Cheerios,
[4966.76s -> 4981.16s]  but some of them taste like pumpernickel bread. It's not a bad thing, but I don't
[4983.88s -> 4989.72s]  put fresh honey on them. But I'm like, I hope you're not, I hope you're still here.
[4992.39s -> 4997.11s]  Look, I put, I didn't put them down below in the trash category. I put them like right here.
[4997.75s -> 5003.91s]  They're definitely better than blueberry. In fact, blueberry should be at the bottom of D.
[5003.91s -> 5012.66s]  Like I, I don't even know. That's only up there because he's friends with Count Chocula.
[5012.66s -> 5017.86s]  You know what I mean? He's like, he's like sapping some of the clout from Count Chocula.
[5017.86s -> 5022.66s]  That's the only reason why he's there. I'm going to, he's coming down. This is like part of Count
[5022.66s -> 5029.29s]  Chocula's entourage. Where's the other one? Yeah. The Count Chocula entourage is not as good as
[5029.29s -> 5041.34s]  Count Chocula. It's cereal nepotism. Yes, that is exactly right. So we're going to put Count
[5041.34s -> 5052.92s]  Chocula where you belong. These are both the same cereal. They just tell you, it just, they just say
[5052.92s -> 5068.55s]  it's a different flavor on the box. All they have to pay for is like the art and the boxwork. Yeah,
[5068.55s -> 5076.58s]  no. I mean, Frankenberry is kind of good. I would say of like the Count Chocula fucking like princes,
[5079.00s -> 5085.53s]  Frankenberry is next in line for throne, I think. Once Count Chocula gets like fucking killed,
[5086.68s -> 5096.54s]  it's like next in line. Here comes Frankenberry. Cereal nobility. Yeah. Once like the throne gets
[5096.54s -> 5108.86s]  overthrown, like the English come in, then yeah, Frankenberry. I don't, I've never had any of these.
[5112.12s -> 5123.72s]  Apple Jacks is the same thing as Apple Jacks. They're the same cereal. So this comes back down
[5123.72s -> 5133.51s]  to here to right. It's the same cereal. There are so many like cinnamon toast, cinnamon apple
[5133.51s -> 5141.10s]  jack. There's so many of those. Everybody has their own version of cinnamon crusty apple crusts
[5141.10s -> 5147.83s]  that it's hard. They blend together and they all have a green box. They have a green and red box.
[5148.98s -> 5155.61s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Green and red box, cinnamon, apple, apple cinnamon flavoring.
[5157.72s -> 5163.00s]  Hold on a minute here. Wait, wait, wait. Apple cinnamon toast crunch is green box,
[5163.00s -> 5166.04s]  green and red. Apple Cheerios, apple cinnamon is green box.
[5170.52s -> 5176.95s]  Come on. They're all, they're all green boxes with red letters and they're all
[5176.95s -> 5185.61s]  apple fucking cinnamon flavoring. Sour Patch. Apple, it's too much apple. It's too sour.
[5185.61s -> 5204.33s]  Don't you get it? Apples are sour. It's a green apple, green box. That was great. J. Jonah Jameson.
[5215.80s -> 5228.89s]  Yummy Mummy. I don't, I don't want it. All right. I definitely, I've never had it before,
[5228.89s -> 5233.21s]  but I don't think I want like, I'm not tall enough to see over the table frosted flakes.
[5233.85s -> 5247.38s]  It's supposed to be big and strong. That's, what's that saying? What's this? Rice,
[5249.72s -> 5257.02s]  Rice Krispies. What is that? That better be an apple fucking flavoring. Is it apple cinnamon?
[5257.58s -> 5273.54s]  Tell me it is. Tell me that's apple fucking cinnamon. I've had frosted flakes with marshmallows.
[5274.26s -> 5300.42s]  They're very bad. Too sugary. Way too sugary. Frosted flakes are so sugary to begin with.
[5300.42s -> 5306.58s]  And then the flavor from the marshmallow, it's too much. It is. I was so excited for these.
[5307.30s -> 5314.28s]  I remember being like, holy shit, that's so awesome. And it's just too much. It's too fucking much.
[5319.16s -> 5324.04s]  It's worse than movie theater food. No, it's not. I have, I'm, look, I'm just placing them
[5324.04s -> 5331.00s]  right now and then I'm going to go through and we're going to figure it out. Yeah. These,
[5331.00s -> 5337.59s]  they're not, they're not that good. They really aren't. Not, not to me. I've never had these.
[5338.55s -> 5344.41s]  Kellogg's corn flakes. Well, Kellogg's corn flakes, I don't think are trash,
[5345.37s -> 5352.36s]  but they're just unfinished frosted flakes. They're default character creator cereal. So
[5352.36s -> 5363.86s]  I'm going to, they have to be below frosted flakes. They're not bad though. Corn flakes are good. Like
[5363.86s -> 5375.10s]  just corn is good. When it's mashed up and like mob, like rocked up, it's when it's smushed up
[5375.10s -> 5379.10s]  and then hardened and baked. I don't know how they make cereal. How do they make cereal?
[5379.10s -> 5384.30s]  How do you, they take, they take corn and they crush it up and like smash it up into a paste
[5384.86s -> 5392.66s]  and they like smear it over a long baking sheet and then they put it in the oven and then they
[5392.66s -> 5399.21s]  hit it with a fucking hammer when it comes out and then they put that in a box. I don't know how they
[5399.21s -> 5410.30s]  made, I don't know how, I don't know how corn flakes are made. It's just magic. I don't know.
[5414.25s -> 5419.70s]  You're exactly right. Thank you. It's good to be right. Why is front? No, okay. Should this
[5419.70s -> 5430.58s]  belong on the movie theater tray? They're not good, but anything compared to Sour Patch Kids
[5430.58s -> 5442.79s]  has to be terrible. In fact, this is so bad that it almost needs its own tier because I'm afraid
[5442.79s -> 5448.79s]  to put anything else down here because it is a direct correlation and almost competitor
[5448.87s -> 5468.81s]  to how gross this cereal is. Okay. Carrot Cheerios. I've never had them. What is that?
[5468.81s -> 5477.42s]  Peach Cheerios. Okay. Running out of fucking fruits to like make your cereal themed after.
[5481.30s -> 5484.42s]  Fiber one. I don't eat any of these. I don't, I've never had any of them.
[5487.03s -> 5497.62s]  Never had any of them. Boys and girls. Yoink. Can I do his voice? Can I do the voice? Let me,
[5498.26s -> 5505.42s]  hey, let me, hold on. Hey kids, have some smack cereal. Oh yeah, smack cereal. Is that close?
[5505.42s -> 5513.06s]  Let's find out. How do I, I need to give me like a video right now. It's something like that.
[5513.06s -> 5523.74s]  Everybody have one. What? Let me, I'll just do it. What? Oh, everybody have one.
[5527.75s -> 5551.03s]  Everybody got one. Smack cereal ad. Here we go. Hey, what do kids think about my catalog smacks?
[5551.03s -> 5554.15s]  Sorry, Digga. I think we all have to agree. They look kind of weird.
[5555.35s -> 5559.99s]  Very scary. Scary looking. Honey smacks are the fun tasting part of a.
[5559.99s -> 5565.88s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. That's not the right one. Here's another, here's, here we go.
[5565.88s -> 5591.53s]  I had it close. No, I can't do it. It's been too long. I've been talking for too long.
[5595.06s -> 5607.98s]  Just do Mark Simpson. Pretend I did it. I had it right. Raisin Bran. I already put Raisin Bran,
[5607.98s -> 5614.81s]  but what's his frosted flakes? Banana cream. Holy, really? Get that tomorrow.
[5615.93s -> 5627.21s]  Banana cream frosted flakes. That sounds really good. Wild berry fruit loops.
[5628.55s -> 5631.59s]  You just change the food dye and that's all you did. I don't want it.
[5634.31s -> 5637.91s]  None of these. I'm not going to order them. I don't want them. These are doubles anyway,
[5637.91s -> 5650.15s]  so don't matter. Pop tart cereal. I'm not interested. I really am not at all. I'm not interested. I'm
[5650.15s -> 5667.02s]  not. I know people are going to be mad about that. Lucio? Lucio O's? You can, can you,
[5667.02s -> 5685.21s]  you can buy, this is like on the shelves? What are, what are they? Is it like Cheerios?
[5686.97s -> 5693.67s]  It's a gamer cereal. I've never had it and I don't think I'm going to buy it. I've never seen that
[5693.67s -> 5702.49s]  before. That's probably only in select locations. Strawberry crispies. I kind of have to try those.
[5703.94s -> 5720.82s]  Peeps cereal. Goodbye. Get out. Out. Out. Peep. No. Awful. Raisin bran crunch. Is that just regular
[5720.82s -> 5734.26s]  raisin bran crunch? Because it's really good if it is. I lost it. There it is. No. Where is it?
[5734.26s -> 5748.49s]  I lost it. Where'd it go? Where the fuck did it just go? Raisin bran crunch. Second row?
[5756.23s -> 5768.36s]  That's the third row. That's not the second row. This is up here in A. It's awesome. Raisin bran.
[5770.98s -> 5774.34s]  Red, white, and blue crunch. Is this like a Fourth of July crunch?
[5775.14s -> 5790.36s]  I've never had it, but I mean it's crunch berries, right? Sprinkled donut crunch. Sprinkled don't.
[5790.36s -> 5800.68s]  All right, get that tomorrow. I want to try that. That sounds weird. What is that? Strawberry,
[5801.40s -> 5807.06s]  strawberry what? Why is this upside down? Why does it look like it's a packet that you
[5807.06s -> 5816.17s]  rip? Is this like a cereal bar? Strawberry, what does that say? Is this a cereal bar? Is this a
[5816.17s -> 5830.22s]  cereal cereal? Yeah, no holiday crunch. That's strange. It's just a bag. Well, I don't really
[5830.22s -> 5835.26s]  want that. I don't know what that is. Strawberry cheesecake crunch or whatever. Same with this one.
[5835.26s -> 5844.55s]  What is it? Sugar cookie toast crunch. No, that's bullshit. You can't call everything French toast.
[5848.18s -> 5856.17s]  Toast crunch. Candy corn toast crunch. Sugar cookie toast crunch. French toast crunch.
[5857.80s -> 5863.24s]  Is it toast or is it a cookie? What the fuck is it? Just have it be sugar toast crunch or cookie
[5863.24s -> 5871.91s]  toast. Sugar toast. Buttered toast crunch. That's a better name. Like why? Sugar cookie toast crunch.
[5872.55s -> 5884.04s]  Peanut butter pops. I never had them. Hostess has a honey bun cereal. Oh, that's gross.
[5884.76s -> 5893.98s]  A bunch of mini honey buns. You've eaten one honey bun before? They're delicious and then you get a
[5893.98s -> 5903.96s]  stomach ache. While you're eating it, it's the best thing ever, but then for some reason you just
[5903.96s -> 5916.89s]  feel bad. I'm going to try it. Wait, the little powdered doughnuts? Is this cereal? Oh my god.
[5917.53s -> 5929.38s]  I want to try that too. I'm going to try these. Sardine toast crunch. Pumpkin spice.
[5930.18s -> 5937.26s]  No, I don't want like a latte cereal. Okay, the rest of these I haven't had, so say goodbye to
[5937.26s -> 5948.17s]  these. This is what we should be concerned with up here. Try them on stream. I mean, I could.
[5950.34s -> 5957.83s]  There's a lot there. How many cereals am I buying? I have to eliminate some for that list.
[5959.48s -> 5963.32s]  All right, most importantly, let's see. Captain Crunch is definitely up there. Rice crispy
[5963.32s -> 5974.12s]  treat cereal is definitely up there. Too best. French toast crunch. Honey made s'mores and
[5974.12s -> 5990.63s]  honey smacks? I don't think belongs there. Reese's puffs I think are up there too. A high two.
[6003.06s -> 6010.58s]  I would say Captain Crunch peanut butter crunch is a superior peanut butter flavored peanut
[6010.58s -> 6019.75s]  buttery kind of cereal than Reese's puffs. I like the flavor of the peanut butter from the Captain
[6019.75s -> 6031.26s]  Crunch one. Trix is not better than any of these. Cinnamon toast crunch is probably better than
[6031.26s -> 6036.54s]  pops. Raisin band crunch is probably better than pops. Pops is probably better than crunch berries,
[6036.54s -> 6040.46s]  but honey smacks are probably better than crunch berries, and Trix are not better than
[6040.46s -> 6056.86s]  crunch berries. Therefore, this list is correct. Raisin band's gonna drop. Raisin brand's dropping
[6056.86s -> 6064.65s]  down. Raisin brand crunch is already up there. This is the cooler one. Again, this is the unfinished
[6064.65s -> 6095.58s]  one. Oh, this is regular Trix. This is fruity shapes Trix. Which one's better? Fruity shapes.
[6095.58s -> 6121.18s]  Get this out of here. Honey nut cherry is the worst. That's a B minus though. That's still very
[6121.18s -> 6137.22s]  good. Would I put cocoa puffs in front of Frosted Flakes? No, I wouldn't. I would not. Justify Trix
[6137.22s -> 6144.58s]  being higher than a C, because Froot Loops are a C, and Trix are just a 10 times better version
[6144.58s -> 6159.00s]  of Froot Loops. It's the same cereal except that this one's just better. The reverse is true.
[6167.64s -> 6172.04s]  Thank you Concrete Car for the five community subs. I think I missed subs earlier too. I was
[6172.04s -> 6177.40s]  too engrossed. But thank you Concrete Car for the five community subs. Thank you.
[6183.38s -> 6187.86s]  Fruity Pebbles, Froot Loops, and Trix are all the same market. They're all the
[6189.21s -> 6195.61s]  sugary, fruity cereals that don't taste like fruit. They taste kind of just like candy.
[6196.41s -> 6203.59s]  These ones taste like candy. These ones taste like bread. And these ones taste like sugary,
[6203.59s -> 6211.90s]  yummy fruits. Now do you want a bread flavored fruit snack? Or do you want, you know, like a
[6211.90s -> 6235.18s]  candy? Or do you want a lighter, crispier, not even close? Back in the medieval days we ate
[6235.18s -> 6241.74s]  bread cereal. No, back in the medieval days you ate like an onion and like you put an onion
[6242.38s -> 6247.58s]  into a boiling bowl of water and like ripped up a bunch of bread and put it in there too and boiled
[6247.58s -> 6259.83s]  it for like four hours. Sometimes there'd be a rabbit in there. And that was a, that was awesome
[6259.83s -> 6266.30s]  if you had that. That's a French onion soup. Where do you think it came from?
[6267.34s -> 6271.66s]  All right. I, I am not going to let Chad influence me. I think Trix is a very, very
[6271.66s -> 6280.58s]  just good cereal. I would put Trix up here with, changing my mind. This belongs in front of Trix.
[6282.49s -> 6286.49s]  It does. It really does. I'm not going to let you, I'm not going to let you guys
[6287.21s -> 6296.78s]  influence me. It's still, that went from an A minus to a B plus, vice versa. Oreo O's,
[6296.78s -> 6302.14s]  it's just too much though. They're very good, but you can only eat one bowl of Oreo O's a week,
[6303.10s -> 6321.16s]  or it's too much. And for that reason, I'm up. But they're very, very, very good. I've never had
[6321.16s -> 6328.38s]  these before. Why are they up here? Get them tomorrow. Banana, banana nut Cheerios, banana
[6328.38s -> 6342.22s]  cream frosted flakes. Okay. This is how I do these lists. Are Trix better than Cocoa Puffs?
[6343.98s -> 6356.01s]  Yes or no. Are Trix better than Kix? Both got the, they've got the same name. They both
[6356.01s -> 6373.05s]  have Ix in their name. Which one is the better Ix? Trix. Are Kix better than Honey Bunches of
[6373.05s -> 6378.55s]  Oats with strawberries? No. Are Kix better than Mini Wheats? Frosted Mini Wheats? Yes.
[6379.53s -> 6384.17s]  Are Frosted Mini Wheats better than Honey Nut Cheerios? No. Are Frosted Mini Wheats better
[6384.17s -> 6395.11s]  than Oreo O's? Yes. There's your list. B. Done. Is Co-chocula? I don't need to say it. You just,
[6395.11s -> 6413.64s]  you know the rule. Okay. Is Cocoa Puffs better than Lucky Charms? Yes. Is Lucky Charms better
[6413.64s -> 6418.68s]  than Honey Bunches of O's? No. Is Honey Bunches of O's better than Lucky Charms? Yes. Okay.
[6418.68s -> 6424.94s]  It was, it was the branding. The branding fucked with me. It's the branding. It's the same brand.
[6424.94s -> 6430.42s]  It's the same thing. This is, this is a, this is a knockoff of each other. Some, you could have a
[6430.42s -> 6441.48s]  lawsuit. One of them could sue the other one. They've got the same opening mouth. They've got
[6441.48s -> 6452.10s]  the same, like zoom in. They've got the same, like it, somebody could get sued. It's the same
[6452.10s -> 6483.77s]  branding box that fucked up my brain. I've been on this single list for an hour. It's very important.
[6483.77s -> 6490.81s]  This is an incredibly important list. Why are Rice Krispies S.S. tier? That is Rice Krispies
[6490.81s -> 6496.95s]  Treats Cereal. That's not just regular Rice Krispies. Regular Rice Krispies is down here.
[6496.95s -> 6520.81s]  That's a Rice Krispies Treats Cereal. Okay. I think I'm happy with this. I think, yeah. Now it's
[6520.89s -> 6529.75s]  Krave is, no. Chips Ahoy. It's just Cookie Krisp, but with an exclamation point on it.
[6530.31s -> 6537.74s]  Honeycomb is good. Fruit Loops, no. Get them down here. Golden Crisp is probably better than these.
[6539.38s -> 6544.10s]  Apple Cinnamon Toast. I don't like those, but they're not, I wouldn't put them down here.
[6546.31s -> 6565.91s]  Maybe I would. I think I would. I don't eat these. Like I, I don't know why I'm putting them up here.
[6570.52s -> 6582.98s]  All right. One step at a time here. All right. So we got another thing that I just figured out
[6582.98s -> 6589.27s]  right here. Count Chocolate is just a much better version of Lucky Charms. It's just, it's like this,
[6589.91s -> 6603.50s]  it's like the, it's like the yin and the yang of cereals. It's, I like this one better. What are we
[6603.50s -> 6614.34s]  talking about? Count Chocolate is like little fucking pieces with marshmallows. This is little
[6614.34s -> 6626.95s]  pieces with marshmallows. They're the original little pieces with marshmallows cereal. Count
[6626.95s -> 6634.31s]  Chocula had the, the, the crispy little like bready pieces and the marshmallows. Lucky Charms had the
[6634.31s -> 6642.50s]  crispy little bready pieces in the marshmallows. What other cereal had that? What other cereal had
[6642.50s -> 6655.06s]  the marshmallows with the, the crispy puffs? Those are the two originals. One of them's chocolate.
[6655.70s -> 6659.14s]  Yeah. That's why I said it's, it's like the opposite, but they're like this, they're the
[6659.14s -> 6670.22s]  same like cereal, but one is opposite of the other. It's like a mirror. These are the original
[6670.22s -> 6677.22s]  fucking characters. Yeah. They've, yeah. They've got like, they add marshmallows to every cereal now.
[6678.60s -> 6682.92s]  Oh dear. Fruity Pebbles with marshmallows. Oh, Frosted Flakes with marshmallows.
[6683.56s -> 6697.38s]  This is the original too. Sorry guys. That's the way it is. I like the, this one better. Donut
[6697.38s -> 6708.10s]  Steel? What's Donut Steel? Imagine thinking Kix is a B, but Fruity Pebbles is a D.
[6717.40s -> 6725.48s]  It's the soggiest fucking cereal in the world. I wanted to do a third party test to see what
[6725.48s -> 6744.10s]  the soggiest damn cereal is. It's going to be Fruity Pebbles. I like my cereal soggy. It's,
[6745.32s -> 6756.81s]  is this your tier list? Whose tier list is this? I like it like this. Whose list is this?
[6756.81s -> 6765.66s]  It's my list. This is not your list. Go make your list. I would love to see it. This is my
[6765.66s -> 6770.55s]  cereal list. I don't like my cereal soggy. Therefore Fruity Pebbles is down here. What's,
[6770.55s -> 6789.94s]  what's going on here? Whose list is this? Getting me heated over fucking sugar in a box.
[6790.58s -> 6803.83s]  It's all dog shit anyways. From A to B, from S to D, these are all, you don't eat a banana.
[6804.39s -> 6809.27s]  Eat a fucking fruit. Have a salad for breakfast. Don't eat these. Don't eat Cocoa Puffs for
[6809.27s -> 6817.83s]  breakfast. What the fuck? Why would you do that? Eat an apple. Eat a pear. They're all like the same
[6817.83s -> 6825.40s]  tier. Just stretched out a little. See these, these aren't even on here. Because I'm a degenerate
[6825.40s -> 6832.17s]  fuck that doesn't eat the good ones. This, this is like just an accordion of bad cereals.
[6832.81s -> 6850.10s]  And that's why I, the Captain Crunch is the best. Cut his bike. I got blueberries on this list. Okay.
[6850.82s -> 6855.86s]  If you want to criticize something, criticize the fact that I don't eat like whole grain cereals.
[6857.38s -> 6863.70s]  All like these good nice whole grain oat cereals are down at the fucking bottom. I've never had
[6863.70s -> 6872.58s]  them, but I've eaten the fucking Captain Crunch entourage like a thousand times. Somebody just
[6872.58s -> 6884.70s]  gave subs. Thank you modest narcissist for the five community subs. Like brand flakes.
[6887.58s -> 6894.94s]  You should be more concerned at my, like I am between the ages of eight and thirteen cereals.
[6896.58s -> 6904.54s]  We, that, that should be more concerning. Actually, well honey, honey, not Cheerios.
[6905.18s -> 6912.06s]  And regular Cheerios, if I was a responsible functioning adult would be up here.
[6914.55s -> 6934.23s]  But no, it's down here. Anyways, I'm going to go on with my cereal list. That just made me think
[6934.23s -> 6940.47s]  about my health a little bit. So these are going to get bumped up a little. That made me concerned
[6940.47s -> 6946.36s]  about my list. Just wanted to move them up just a little bit because I'm a little concerned about
[6946.36s -> 6952.86s]  my health now about like Crunch Berry, Captain Crunch. It makes up at least every top tier
[6952.86s -> 6964.15s]  at least once. I probably should bump up multi-grain Cheerios a little. Yeah, pops are on here.
[6964.15s -> 6969.43s]  Come on. Putting higher cereals up on your list is not going to improve your health.
[6972.84s -> 6977.08s]  All right. Now that we've cleared that up, we've gotten that out of the way. Let's, let's continue.
[6984.07s -> 6989.66s]  Put these on the order list because I don't want them. Oreos at B is a travesty.
[6997.83s -> 7022.47s]  I'm drinking coffee at 10 o'clock at night. Health. I know you, I know you love some of these cereals.
[7022.47s -> 7037.59s]  I do too. And for that reason, I'm just, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. D tier. Now,
[7037.59s -> 7044.92s]  Lucky Charms really is not that good. Multi-grain Cheerios and Cornflakes are definitely not better
[7046.65s -> 7052.50s]  than, than Raisin Brin. Cornflakes actually should be somewhere down here.
[7053.14s -> 7071.72s]  Crave should be down here. I think this is the new recipe. I don't like it. All right. I'm happy
[7071.72s -> 7086.36s]  with this. Now I am. Now I am. Now I'm, now, now I'm happy with this. Now I am. Yeah, I think so.
[7086.36s -> 7093.38s]  Okay. This is the D list. This is cereals that I, I still think are all right, but I don't really
[7093.38s -> 7098.58s]  buy because they're just, they're too much of a pain in the ass to eat or they're too bland for me.
[7135.54s -> 7145.00s]  Guys, I gotta say something here. Real important. I put Fruity Pebbles down on the D list.
[7145.72s -> 7170.57s]  I didn't scream in your mother's face. It's, it's the same. I took, I'm finishing my list.
[7173.37s -> 7180.14s]  Wheaties. They're fine. Coconut. Fruity Pebbles. I don't want them. I don't want these. What are
[7180.14s -> 7190.04s]  they? Oh, the Tweedledee and Tweedledum. They can stay where they are. Golden Grahams. Probably a
[7190.04s -> 7194.89s]  little bit better. Probably Golden Grahams is probably better than all these. You know what?
[7195.45s -> 7202.73s]  Golden Grahams is definitely better than all of these two. I, I was, I went, I jumped that too
[7202.73s -> 7209.06s]  quick. Golden Grahams is really, really good. The only issue I have is like they get soggy in 10
[7209.06s -> 7213.38s]  seconds, but the 10 seconds that you get to eat them, they're fucking, they're really, they're good.
[7214.02s -> 7225.05s]  It belongs up here. Why is Cheerios a D? No, no, it belongs there. That's like D minus though.
[7226.23s -> 7230.79s]  I would probably rather eat Cheerios. Yeah, I'd rather eat Cheerios than Frosted Cheerios.
[7231.83s -> 7251.94s]  Hell-conscious guy. Notice how, noticing pattern. I just don't really like Cheerios.
[7254.31s -> 7261.14s]  Really that much at all. Rice Krispies are probably better than these two meme cereals.
[7273.34s -> 7279.02s]  It's weird because I've probably eaten these two cereals less than the amount of times I've seen
[7279.02s -> 7290.09s]  it on Adult Swim. So there's, there's a reason why it's down here. Apple Jacks is A tier.
[7298.55s -> 7326.52s]  For you, maybe. But hmm. Foot Captain Crunch in the trash tier. Where's the Mario cereal? The
[7326.52s -> 7337.35s]  Mario cereal wasn't on here. If you watch the commercial for Apple Jacks, it'll be S tier.
[7343.11s -> 7349.48s]  I think that's the list. I think that's it. These, this is a pretty, look,
[7349.48s -> 7354.84s]  look at the first three rows. The, here's the thing. Everybody's first two or three rows are
[7354.84s -> 7361.75s]  going to be kind of similar. Everybody, every other cereal in like B to D is super personal
[7361.75s -> 7367.69s]  opinion. It's all just personal opinion, right? Everybody fucking knows. Everybody on earth knows
[7367.69s -> 7372.17s]  that Cinnamon Toast Crunch is a great cereal. Raisin Bran Crunch is a great cereal. Pops,
[7372.17s -> 7376.25s]  Smacks, Crunch Berries, Frosted Flakes, these are all A. Everybody knows that. Everybody knows that.
[7376.89s -> 7385.96s]  This down here is what you get to, like personal opinion. Pops is a, how could you not, Pops,
[7386.68s -> 7393.42s]  Pops is one of the most unique cereals. It's, Honey Smacks and Pops are not just
[7394.30s -> 7399.10s]  toasted fucking corn with marshmallows in it. It's not just like a circle that tastes like bread.
[7399.82s -> 7404.46s]  Honey Smacks tastes wildly different than anything else. Pops tastes really wildly different than
[7404.46s -> 7409.48s]  anything else. Captain Crunch tastes wildly different than anything. Let me tell you what
[7409.48s -> 7414.52s]  cereals taste exactly the same, okay? Ready for me to blow up this whole scenario here?
[7414.52s -> 7429.82s]  These are the cereals that taste exact identical to each other. Ready? These, one, two, these two.
[7429.82s -> 7434.14s]  You know, the idea is that they all taste, they all taste pretty similar except for like three of
[7434.14s -> 7444.17s]  them. These two, these two, these three, these like four, all the Cheerios that have different
[7444.17s -> 7449.11s]  like fucking seasoning packets on them. It's still Cheerios. They still taste the same. This is just
[7449.11s -> 7455.45s]  a mirror. Look, they taste different. That's all I need to know. Crave is too low. All right,
[7455.45s -> 7464.76s]  you know, somebody said Crave is too low. It's going up here. Honey Smacks tastes
[7464.76s -> 7490.74s]  different than anything else. Do a cigarette tier list. Oh yeah, marbles. They're all belonging to
[7490.74s -> 7496.92s]  trash. Can I put them all down here? All right, please, can we just agree? Can we agree on
[7496.92s -> 7502.57s]  something? This is, guys, this is a cereal list. This is like British Parliament right now.
[7503.13s -> 7508.09s]  Can we all agree on one thing? Sour Patch Kids cereals should be removed from shelves.
[7511.16s -> 7519.83s]  Like we, come on, like why would it be there? That's like why? And peeps, that's what, no.
[7521.06s -> 7539.59s]  And these are just not very good. But Sour Patch Kids, we can all agree on that. I'm good. I got
[7539.59s -> 7546.36s]  my list. I'm happy with it. I think it's good for me. That's my, those are my favorite cereals.
[7548.22s -> 7557.67s]  In the comments section below, write out your favorite cereals. What is this? Annoying Orange
[7557.67s -> 7577.00s]  characters. I'm not doing that one. Pasta rankings. Ben and Jerry's ice cream flavors. I don't think
[7577.00s -> 7583.34s]  I've had enough of them to be able to give an opinion. Fruit tier list. All right, do you
[7583.34s -> 7591.46s]  got a fruit? I'll give you the fruit tier list. I will. What is it? Is there actually like a big,
[7591.46s -> 7597.54s]  a nice good fruit tier list? I'll do it. I'm gonna do it quick. Jelly Belly flavors. Don't even need
[7597.54s -> 7604.02s]  the list. Every single one F. Toasted Marshmallow S. Pick them all out and put the other, like just
[7604.02s -> 7608.18s]  give them to somebody else for like a present. Take, here's the tactic. Take out all the toasted
[7608.18s -> 7614.20s]  marshmallow ones, eat them, reseal it and give it to somebody for a present. All right, fruit tier
[7614.20s -> 7622.63s]  list. I'm getting linked to a lot of these. Give me the one with like the most amount of options.
[7623.27s -> 7635.66s]  Okay, let's link that. All right, this is apparently for, get a screenshot of that.
[7636.30s -> 7639.18s]  Oh, you know, get a screenshot of that because I get a screenshot of this because I need to know
[7639.18s -> 7645.91s]  what I'm gonna get tomorrow. Especially this part. The list is too big. So now that you got that
[7645.91s -> 7653.72s]  screenshot, thank you. Here's the actual list. There you go. Okay, this is fruits coming up.
[7659.38s -> 7682.47s]  Okay, this one shouldn't be too hard. This is only mainstream fruits. I didn't, I wasn't aware that
[7682.47s -> 7689.22s]  they were underground. It's like indie dev fruits. Sorry, these are, well we're only doing AAA fruits
[7689.22s -> 7704.79s]  today. Okay, I am a citrus kind of guy. People are gonna get so mad about this stuff.
[7707.53s -> 7719.18s]  I'm just like opening up all avenues of attack is what I'm doing. Boy, hold on a minute. This is
[7719.18s -> 7727.78s]  important. Is this eating the fruit? Or is this the flavor of the fruit? Well, is it eating the
[7727.78s -> 7738.87s]  fruit? Because some fruits taste all right, but they're gross to me. Eating it. Okay, fuck,
[7738.87s -> 7743.99s]  because I think I love oranges. I love orange juice. I just, I don't like eating an orange.
[7743.99s -> 7749.19s]  I think they're disgusting eating them. You get like orange gristle. I hate oranges. I hate eating
[7749.19s -> 7764.49s]  oranges. The white like gristle. That's gonna change everything. I'm gonna go with flavor.
[7765.13s -> 7779.48s]  Like the way that it tastes. I don't, what's this one? Is that a tomato? What is that? I don't know
[7779.48s -> 7806.38s]  what that fruit is. It's a pumpkin. That's not a pumpkin. Lemons are the best fruits.
[7807.99s -> 7813.98s]  Lemon is fucking unbelievable. Guess what? So is, no I'm changing that. Pineapple is my favorite
[7814.06s -> 7819.91s]  fruit. Lemon is my favorite like fruit flavor. Lemon and water. A squeeze of lemon. Lemon
[7819.91s -> 7827.67s]  flavoring. That like tart, sour, citrusy lemon flavor is my favorite flavor besides pineapple.
[7834.90s -> 7847.72s]  I am a, I am a, I'm a like kind of fruit guy. It's got to be like citrusy and fresh,
[7847.72s -> 7855.58s]  refreshing. I'm gonna make a lot of people mad with a couple of these. Disgusting. Absolutely
[7855.58s -> 7865.38s]  fucking revolting. Not because these, how many times, eating berries. You, it's like eating sand.
[7866.33s -> 7873.05s]  You crunch on this like, like a fucking hard sand. Try and blend them up. It doesn't work.
[7873.05s -> 7878.49s]  You're drinking sand. You're eating sand. Those seeds in berries are the most obnoxious things.
[7878.49s -> 7889.10s]  It's like eating fucking popcorn kernels. You said flavor. I did say flavor, but sometimes you
[7889.10s -> 7893.58s]  got to think about like the horrible experiences you've had. I've had a horrible experience eating
[7893.58s -> 7898.22s]  blackberries before, right, over raspberries. What are these? Yeah, I've had a horrible experience
[7898.22s -> 7912.86s]  eating these. Flavor-wise, they're good, but I can't. I'm gonna leave them there for now.
[7915.13s -> 7925.38s]  Cherries. Bananas. Bananas and smoothies are amazing. Bananas, they're great. I love letting
[7925.38s -> 7931.02s]  bananas rot, almost to the point where they're rotting, and then eat them. Some of you people
[7931.02s -> 7935.74s]  will know what I'm talking about. Some of you guys here will know. Right before the banana starts to
[7935.74s -> 7954.94s]  get really, really kind of ripe, overripe, is when I'd like to eat them the most. Uh, and by the way,
[7954.94s -> 7967.88s]  where's your mother? Because I'm gonna scream in her face. What are these? Watermelon. Ew,
[7967.88s -> 7972.36s]  ew, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross. Worst. How do I have, no, where's the worst? I gotta make like,
[7972.36s -> 7980.50s]  disgusting tier. I have to make awful tier. Add a row below. No, no, no, no, no. Disg- awful, awful,
[7980.50s -> 7987.27s]  awful. Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. F. Grapefruits taste like stomach acid.
[7990.76s -> 8001.86s]  You know how, so my mother used to eat these. My mother would cut a grapefruit in half,
[8002.58s -> 8007.46s]  and she would put a little, uh, spork with, you know, the spoon that has little, little, uh,
[8007.46s -> 8011.94s]  ridges on top, and she would eat it half a grapefruit. And it's like, oh, okay, you're
[8011.94s -> 8017.22s]  gonna eat half a grapefruit. But every time before she went in with it, you know, went in with the
[8017.22s -> 8024.30s]  spoon, she would cover the top of the half with sugar. And apparently that was like the way to
[8024.30s -> 8032.34s]  make it taste like, worth eating out of the half. If you have to add sugar to fruit, I don't think
[8032.34s -> 8042.22s]  it's worth eating. You have to add something on top. Well, it would only taste good if I put
[8042.22s -> 8046.81s]  fucking a bunch of salt on it. No. Grapefruit juice is also disgusting.
[8051.45s -> 8064.94s]  I'm sorry, I'm upsetting a lot of people, but that's the way it is. Where's kiwi? Done. What is this
[8064.94s -> 8077.96s]  corn? What is that? Lime? Weirdly enough, lime not as good as lemon to me. Belongs up there. What is
[8077.96s -> 8086.65s]  that, coconut? Actually, I hate coconut. I love coconut juice. I like coconut milk, coconut water,
[8086.65s -> 8098.79s]  but coconut. I don't really like coconut eating it. It's gonna be bad. What the fuck is this?
[8102.39s -> 8112.36s]  Is it ice cream? Is that Oreo? Is that cookies and cream ice cream? I've never, I've never eaten that.
[8115.48s -> 8122.90s]  Grapes? Grapes can be up here as long as they're frozen. I don't like eating regular grapes.
[8124.26s -> 8128.10s]  If they're frozen, I like them. But the reason why I don't like eating grapes is because my brother
[8128.10s -> 8132.90s]  told me a story one time about how, uh, watch out when you eat grapes because there could be
[8132.90s -> 8142.62s]  spiders in them. And that just freaked me out enough to put them down to be. But frozen grapes,
[8142.62s -> 8163.74s]  I think are amazing. Strawberry? Eh. Are you ready to have everybody hate me? I'm gonna get off camera
[8163.74s -> 8192.50s]  for this one. Apples suck. There's only one apple that I actually will eat willingly, and that's a
[8192.50s -> 8214.74s]  Macintosh apple. Soft flesh apples. I heard something over there. What was that? It has to
[8214.74s -> 8224.84s]  be crispy. I don't look, I don't like apple pie. I don't like apple fritters. I don't like apple
[8224.84s -> 8232.87s]  jacks. I don't like cinnamon apple cereal. I don't like apple. I don't like apple pie. I don't like
[8232.87s -> 8238.47s]  anything with cooked apples in it because every time I eat something with cooked apples, if it's
[8238.47s -> 8244.47s]  apple pie, oh, whoa, oozy, yummy, hot apple pie. I love that filling until you get the piece of the
[8244.47s -> 8251.27s]  apple and it's like an old person sucking up a fucking prune. It's like a slippery slug, a hot
[8251.27s -> 8261.74s]  slug that you... No, disgusting. I don't like that. I don't like it. I'm sorry. I'll eat Macintosh
[8261.74s -> 8272.60s]  apples. I like blueberry iced coffee. Blueberries are right here. I just put it at A. Hot apples
[8272.60s -> 8283.77s]  taste like a warm slug. I don't want to eat, I don't want to do that. I would eat a Macintosh
[8283.77s -> 8289.43s]  apple right now if you brought it in here. I'd be like, okay, this is great. I like this. I like
[8289.43s -> 8301.24s]  being able to like, and it's pretty juicy and flows down your face. I will say the green apples
[8301.24s -> 8320.84s]  are better than red apples. Melon, listen, melon is the fruit that you dig around in the fruit cup
[8320.84s -> 8328.71s]  to eat the fruit that you want to eat. Once you run out of the good ones, you go,
[8329.51s -> 8341.62s]  oh, well, I guess there's melon in here. I just, I just saw it for the first time tonight. I saw
[8341.62s -> 8368.36s]  go to hell. Go to hell. What is this? Oh, is this a Clementine? Tangerine. All right. This is
[8368.36s -> 8388.15s]  important. Nectarine. Oh, this is peach. This one's nectarine, right? Nectarine belongs up here.
[8388.15s -> 8397.77s]  Peach is really close behind. In fact, nectarine may have to take the spot of watermelon.
[8397.77s -> 8405.83s]  Nectarines are incredible. You want, remember I told you like the Macintosh apple, when you bite
[8405.83s -> 8412.28s]  into it, it's like that, if you get a ripe nectarine, the thing, it's as if somebody
[8412.28s -> 8421.35s]  fucking just like sprayed, like sprayed a hose in your face. It's like, it's incredible. It's,
[8421.35s -> 8427.35s]  it's okay. Nectarines are what gushers the fruit snack we're trying to emulate very poorly, very
[8427.35s -> 8436.66s]  badly. You get that like super soft bite with that flow of like fruit juice down into your mouth.
[8436.66s -> 8440.18s]  Oh my God. I'm good. Where's the list that I can put this on and get these tomorrow at the grocery
[8440.18s -> 8448.97s]  store? Peaches are gross. Peaches are not, I don't think peaches are as good as nectarines.
[8449.61s -> 8454.02s]  I still think they're good though. Sometimes I pretend to be like a bee when I eat them too.
[8454.02s -> 8458.90s]  Like this is like, this is, this is what like a bee did this. And I'm like taste, I'm like eating
[8458.98s -> 8469.88s]  like nature bee. Like I'm a bee, like a nectar. Pears, it depends on what kind of pear, but I
[8469.88s -> 8476.79s]  usually like pears. Pears are better than apples. I don't know if I, yeah, pears, I probably eat
[8476.79s -> 8488.90s]  blueberries over pears. The rest of these, I don't know what these are. This is other orange. This is,
[8489.78s -> 8497.82s]  I don't know what that is. What is this one? Is it papaya? This is a mango? Which one's a mango?
[8501.40s -> 8508.76s]  What's the corn one? It's a permission, permission, permission. What is it?
[8518.07s -> 8525.05s]  I don't, I don't really, I'm not like into it. Mango and papaya, which one of these is which?
[8526.71s -> 8533.67s]  I like mango salsa. I don't eat mangoes though. A little too slimy for me, a little too slippery
[8533.67s -> 8539.03s]  and slimy. When you like cut into, you have like mango slices, it's like covered in ice. You like
[8539.03s -> 8548.39s]  pick it up, it just slips out of you, it's too slimy and slippery. I do like, I do like, I need
[8548.39s -> 8562.34s]  some more down at sea. Okay, let's do it. Best fruit on earth is a pineapple. Fresh cored pineapple
[8563.45s -> 8573.19s]  that is ripe. It cannot be compared to anything, anything. It's every single thing you want in a
[8573.19s -> 8579.19s]  fruit. It's really good for you. It's really fucking delicious. It's got an incredibly distinct flavor
[8580.34s -> 8584.10s]  and it has an enzyme in it that eats your fucking flesh from the inside out.
[8585.00s -> 8596.09s]  Fucking sick. That's like cool. Bad ass, right? Kiwis on the other hand are lighter. I could eat
[8596.09s -> 8601.69s]  like five of these and be like, oh that was pretty good. Cut them up into little tiny thin slices,
[8601.69s -> 8607.51s]  like I'm talking like deli thin. Lay them out and just pick them up and eat them like little
[8607.51s -> 8614.71s]  cucumbers. They're great. You can eat the skin. I don't, too fuzzy, too, too fuzzy for me.
[8615.82s -> 8626.84s]  But I do love kiwis, so I think that that's good for me. Two of the best fruits. Lemons is just
[8626.84s -> 8631.88s]  top tier flavor for me. I would put nectarine in front of it, but I'm not going to because I
[8632.76s -> 8640.46s]  drink lemon water all the time. If I drink a glass of water, I usually have a little lemon squeezer
[8640.46s -> 8644.94s]  and I just squeeze like a half a lemon in the water and drink it sometimes, maybe like once in a while.
[8645.90s -> 8648.30s]  I just like that. I like the taste. I like the way it makes you feel.
[8649.34s -> 8659.48s]  Where do plums go? Plums are down here, but they might not be there forever. This is just
[8659.48s -> 8666.58s]  a preliminary. I had to do it. So yeah, watermelons. As you can tell by this list,
[8666.58s -> 8673.35s]  I'm really into those fruits that are really easy to bite into. So you bite into them and
[8673.35s -> 8676.95s]  your teeth just kind of melt right there. It's like having like meat off the bone, like a barb,
[8676.95s -> 8687.32s]  like a smoked brisket. These two are the smoked brisket of the fruit world. It's tender,
[8687.32s -> 8694.14s]  your teeth go right through it, and it's just juicy and delicious. Yes, that's why they're up
[8694.14s -> 8701.27s]  here. Peach is pretty close, but I like nectarines better than peach. We already described that. This
[8701.27s -> 8707.27s]  is tangerines. I would probably put tangerines down this way. More close. No, this is orange.
[8707.99s -> 8715.21s]  Tangerines are already down there. I like orange probably more than banana, but I like blueberry
[8715.21s -> 8719.61s]  more than I like banana, and I like banana more than I like pear. Strawberry and lime.
[8720.81s -> 8729.13s]  This is where you get into... I like it. I would eat it every day. I would. I would eat any of
[8729.13s -> 8738.54s]  these pretty much any day. Cherries, too much work. You know what I mean? Too much work. You
[8738.54s -> 8744.38s]  got to eat it. You don't swallow the fucking seed. There's a giant core in the middle,
[8745.34s -> 8749.74s]  and you got to work around it, and then spit it out. What do you do with it? Spit it out in your
[8749.74s -> 8760.95s]  hand? Too much work. I'm not like a big cherry flavor kind of person. Just pull it out on your
[8760.95s -> 8773.38s]  date. Oh, so what is it that you do for work again? I'm a scientist. I work for NASA. What?
[8773.54s -> 8781.26s]  No, come on. What is this one again? I don't remember. That's why it's down here. It's a
[8781.26s -> 8786.10s]  mango, papaya. Decent flavoring. I like the flavorings better than these.
[8790.49s -> 8803.61s]  Look, seed does not mean bad. Seed does not mean bad. Seed is fine. I like cherry coke,
[8805.14s -> 8815.06s]  and I like grenadine syrup, but that's bullshit tier. That's not real. Now here we go.
[8818.70s -> 8823.98s]  Raspberries are definitely... I really don't even know what the cookies and cream thing
[8823.98s -> 8828.62s]  even tastes like, so I can't even really put it on the list, but it's not F because I don't
[8828.62s -> 8838.55s]  really know. I definitely would rather eat all of these before I would eat an apple.
[8841.38s -> 8847.30s]  You gave me a choice. You said, hey, here's a bunch of raspberries or apples. Eat one.
[8847.30s -> 8860.31s]  I would be like, oh, raspberry. I'll take one. I avoid these at all costs. In fact,
[8860.31s -> 8881.21s]  that's how it should look. I think that's pretty accurate for me. Where's the pomegranate? It's not
[8881.21s -> 8884.73s]  on this list. Although pomegranate would be somewhere in front of cherry because I feel
[8884.73s -> 8892.30s]  like they're like... Plus pomegranate, the inside of it looks fucking weird. It's weird. It's like
[8892.30s -> 8898.06s]  a bunch of strange scattered egg sacs inside with seeds in it, like spiders. There's spiders in
[8898.06s -> 8901.98s]  there. Those could be spider eggs. That's all I know. My brother told me that one time. That's
[8901.98s -> 8912.44s]  why I can't eat it. Okay, so there it is. Any more brain busters? Cheeses? I'll do cheeses.
[8913.08s -> 8922.10s]  How long is this stream? We're still going. Have I eaten enough cheeses for this to work?
[8927.26s -> 8934.98s]  I'm not going to do annoying orange characters. They're all annoying. Is there just one bar that
[8934.98s -> 8944.47s]  just is annoying on it? Do soda. I could all do soda. Give me a good soda one. Chips? We'll do
[8944.47s -> 8960.39s]  soda. I'm talking a good soda one. Let's check this one out. Soda. That was fruits. Here comes
[8960.39s -> 8975.08s]  soda. Oh, this is a lot. Okay, I do appreciate they have it all set up already. The trash and
[8975.08s -> 8983.53s]  I don't care. I haven't had it. I don't care. Let's go. This is... I don't think I've had that,
[8983.53s -> 8989.54s]  but I love 7-Up. 7-Up I think is better than Sprite by a pretty decent margin, I think.
[8990.26s -> 9003.38s]  Dr. Pepper has fallen off from me in recent years. A&W root beer is the best root beer. Cream soda,
[9003.38s -> 9011.64s]  I used to love it, but I think it's disgusting now. When I was 15, 16, 17 years old, I was obsessed
[9011.64s -> 9019.72s]  with this stuff. But now it almost just tastes like... it just tastes like they got halfway
[9019.72s -> 9025.30s]  through and they stopped making the soda. They added the water, the carbonation, and a bunch of
[9025.30s -> 9029.22s]  sugar caramely kind of sugar flavor, and then they didn't. They stopped. There needs to be
[9029.22s -> 9038.89s]  something else. It's weird. It doesn't do it for me anymore. Barks root beer. I don't know if it's
[9038.89s -> 9045.10s]  better than A&W, but it's still all right. That's how we drink it. Barks is good. Is this some water?
[9045.82s -> 9062.10s]  What is that? This is just water? If it's water, then I'm gonna... I'm just gonna pretend this is
[9062.10s -> 9072.97s]  water. It belongs up here. I have an ad. I don't know what that is. There's no way you could never
[9072.97s -> 9079.13s]  in your whole life have never tried water. You getting water accidentally in your mouth in the
[9079.13s -> 9086.97s]  shower counts. There's no way anyone's never had water. You'd be dead. You would just die.
[9087.61s -> 9093.78s]  You would just turn into bones. It'd be dead. I don't really know what that is, so it's off the
[9093.78s -> 9100.86s]  list. Is this iced tea? I wish there was like a zoom in button. What is this? Is this iced tea?
[9104.63s -> 9123.82s]  This is not breast milk. I like... What does it say? It's called balls? I don't know what this is.
[9125.03s -> 9131.58s]  Balls. I don't... I don't know what this is either. Canada Dry ginger ale goes up here. I'm... This
[9131.58s -> 9150.14s]  is gonna be a deliberation here. It's gonna take me a while. Oh, fuck. Uh-oh. This is the real one
[9150.14s -> 9190.73s]  right here. Where does Pepsi go? Coke's better than Pepsi. Sorry. Like 44% of you now think that
[9190.73s -> 9201.46s]  I'm like talking to the devil every night before I go to bed. I now pray to the devil every night
[9201.46s -> 9217.37s]  before I go to sleep. To half of you guys know. Is this like steak sauce? Dads? Uh, no. Cherry
[9217.37s -> 9223.11s]  Coke? Not as good as regular Coke. Um, this is like... What is this? Like espresso Coke?
[9223.83s -> 9234.44s]  I don't think I've ever had that. Get this shit out of here. Stop drinking this. Honest to God.
[9235.67s -> 9244.33s]  Get the fuck out of here. Diet fucking Coke. Diet Pepsi. Just... No. Get... Don't stop. Don't...
[9244.33s -> 9255.61s]  Don't drink them anymore. No. A&W cream soda is better than this. Don't drink that anymore.
[9256.17s -> 9263.88s]  Like, I'm looking out for your health. Anymore diet sodas on this list? Do you see any? Because
[9263.88s -> 9276.57s]  they're going in the trash. These are just... These are fucking awful too. The Minute Maid
[9277.21s -> 9287.43s]  lemonade in the fucking jar. No, no, no. They're bad. No. These lemonades in the fucking... That
[9287.43s -> 9294.62s]  come out of the bottle are so over sweetened. It tastes like syrup. It's like lemon syrup. It's
[9294.62s -> 9300.06s]  not even like fucking... It's not even like drinking like refreshing, like, quencher. It's syrup.
[9301.69s -> 9307.21s]  You could cut this like three times. This is a lemonade concentrate. That's not lemonade.
[9307.21s -> 9315.38s]  You can make four lemonades out of this. Tastes good, but just save some money. Buy one of those
[9315.38s -> 9319.70s]  and then just cut it with water. Like at least 40% of it. It'll... You'll be like, oh wow, that's not
[9319.70s -> 9324.97s]  even that much of a difference. Trying to say I'm looking out for you. But both of them...
[9332.94s -> 9340.22s]  If this were... If this were younger teenage me, this would be up here. I am a sucker for
[9340.94s -> 9346.84s]  Shirley Temples. Mountain Dew Code Red is as close to a bottled Shirley Temple as you can get.
[9349.05s -> 9357.54s]  I love... If Shirley Temple was on here, I would put it up an S tier. They're so good,
[9357.54s -> 9362.62s]  but they're just so bad for you. But this is probably... Probably truly belongs somewhere down
[9362.62s -> 9375.35s]  here. Sprite. I actually prefer Sprite over any of the other amber drinks at this point,
[9376.82s -> 9380.58s]  besides root beer. Like I said, Dr. Pepper has fallen off a little bit for me.
[9381.30s -> 9397.90s]  This is... These are meme sodas. I don't want them. What is... Is this the same thing? Is this
[9397.90s -> 9401.34s]  vanilla Coke? Isn't this vanilla Coke too? They're both the same one, right?
[9406.65s -> 9413.77s]  Is this one different? Wait, is this the orange Coke? Is this the orange one? If it's the orange
[9413.77s -> 9419.08s]  one, it's going somewhere very specific. This is Coke Orange? Confirmed? This is Coke... Confirmed
[9419.08s -> 9439.05s]  Coke Orange? Confirmed Coke Orange? It's awful. Pepsi's already up there. RC Cola is... May as
[9439.05s -> 9444.52s]  well just be the same thing as all the other ones. But it's like the worst one of them all, I guess.
[9444.52s -> 9450.65s]  But it's cheaper though, right? Maybe I would drink it. Mellow Yellow is Mountain Dew.
[9451.29s -> 9467.27s]  And speaking of Mountain Dew, do you know where this has gone? Into the trash. This other Mountain
[9467.27s -> 9486.71s]  Dew. Crush Orange Soda. Somewhere up here. Sierra Mist. Somewhere up here. I don't know. What does
[9486.71s -> 9499.18s]  this one say? I don't... What's this one? Chucky Cheese? Chucky Cheese Soda? Wait, this is Baja?
[9499.18s -> 9515.88s]  This is Baja Blast? That's... It's better. It's good. Zoom in. No, I'm trying to exercise my eyes.
[9517.66s -> 9523.74s]  Chucky Cheese Soda. I've never had it. Fanta. Fanta is just kind of Orange Crush, but it's...
[9524.38s -> 9527.82s]  They're both essentially identical. There's no differences. I think one of them is a little
[9527.82s -> 9533.48s]  more syrupy. I think Fanta is a little syrupy for me. So I'll probably put it down. I don't
[9533.48s -> 9539.91s]  think I really want it. I'd rather get a Crush. I really don't like a Grape Soda. If I'm going
[9539.91s -> 9543.35s]  to get a Crush, it's going to be the Orange variant, not the Grape one. So I'm not a big fan
[9543.35s -> 9548.47s]  of Orange Grape Soda. I don't know what this is. This looks like Strawberry Soda, but I've never
[9548.47s -> 9555.26s]  had it. Jolt Cola. Don't drink it. Stop being fucking aware of it. Is this Cigarette Ashes in
[9555.26s -> 9570.28s]  Water? Oh, no. It's IVC Root Beer? Is this the Cream Soda? I haven't had this one before.
[9571.00s -> 9576.68s]  IVC Root Beer, though, is pretty good. I don't know if it's better than like... It's probably
[9576.68s -> 9582.68s]  on the same level as Barks. And these should be down a little more. I think I would rather
[9582.68s -> 9589.91s]  have like a Vanilla Coke than like a Root Beer. Although, I would probably... I would rather have...
[9590.63s -> 9594.87s]  Now, wait a minute. This is very specific. It's not in the can. I would rather have the Glass
[9594.87s -> 9603.54s]  Bottle IVC Root Beer than the can of Coke. I think so, because that doesn't come in a can.
[9606.01s -> 9613.66s]  Yeah, I would put normal vanilla in the trash. I like vanilla. What's wrong with vanilla Coke?
[9613.66s -> 9617.82s]  I like it. It's good. I don't drink it all the time, but sometimes you just... you're looking
[9617.82s -> 9626.65s]  for it and you want it. Squirt has not been available, I don't think, for like 25 years, so
[9628.38s -> 9644.66s]  Surge is another meme soda. I've never had it. Why is this an eBay listing? That's the best picture
[9644.66s -> 9662.04s]  you can find? Storm Soda. I've never had it. Mellow Yellow is... I think it's better than Mountain Dew,
[9662.04s -> 9665.40s]  but not by very much. I don't think it's better. Hold on. It's definitely better than this.
[9666.74s -> 9676.89s]  It's the Star Wars flavor. The rest of these are kind of the same... wait, but it's bottles. Ah,
[9677.61s -> 9683.40s]  I get it. Yeah, all right. So I'd rather have a bottle of Coke than a can of Coke.
[9685.16s -> 9693.37s]  Bottom tier for me is plastic bottles. Plastic Bottle Coke. Plastic Bottle Pepsi
[9694.25s -> 9707.56s]  is F tier. Can Coke, Bottle Coke is better for me. Plastic Bottle... no, I just... if I can...
[9707.56s -> 9716.49s]  I don't want it. It's going in the trash. I would never... I cannot think of any scenario ever,
[9717.91s -> 9733.88s]  and I mean actually ever, that I would buy a Plastic Bottle Pepsi. I wouldn't. I wouldn't do it.
[9733.88s -> 9737.48s]  That has to go in the trash. It's... I mean, Pepsi is obviously... I would drink Pepsi.
[9739.02s -> 9745.02s]  I wouldn't avoid Pepsi. That's fine. Whatever. But I'm not going to buy a plastic fucking bottle of
[9745.02s -> 9753.22s]  Pepsi. Look at chat. What? You have vanilla Coke in the trash. The one next to Coke is regular
[9753.22s -> 9770.25s]  caffeine free. I thought this was the orange one. What? You have vanilla in the trash. Orange isn't
[9770.25s -> 9775.99s]  on here. Well, I'm just going to pretend that's what they are. No, in my... that's fine. This is
[9775.99s -> 9781.67s]  vanilla Coke. This is orange Coke. It's in the trash. That's fine. We can use our own list.
[9784.92s -> 9792.84s]  Here, look. This is vanilla, and just pretend that this is orange Coke. It's caffeine free Coke.
[9793.85s -> 9801.42s]  That's fine. I would put it in here anyways. Just, yeah, play pretend. All right. Hold on.
[9803.54s -> 9812.15s]  I'm missing some stuff here. What is that? Oh, okay. Bottle of Coke versus Bottle of IVC Root
[9812.15s -> 9816.31s]  Beer. Probably Bottle of Coke. Especially if it's like frosty. If there's like still like
[9817.27s -> 9825.26s]  white frosty shit all over it. And, ah, yeah. Only if it has the white frosty shit all over it.
[9825.26s -> 9831.93s]  Otherwise, it's not as good. While I'm holding that in my hand, it has to burn me. It has to be
[9831.93s -> 9845.99s]  like this is too fucking cold to even hold my hands. That's Mexican Coke. That's fine. Yeah,
[9845.99s -> 9859.02s]  that's even actually even better. Pib Extra. I don't care. Oh, this is ginger beer, right?
[9859.74s -> 9864.42s]  This stuff is actually pretty good. This is pretty good. I will put this up here.
[9864.42s -> 9884.26s]  That's good stuff. A&W gives me a stomach ache. Is this a bottle of Pepsi or is this a special
[9884.26s -> 9890.50s]  Pepsi? I think that's just a glass bottle of Pepsi. I would... no, I'd rather have these two.
[9892.79s -> 9907.14s]  Crystal Pepsi is a funny laugh out loud ecto cooler 90s kids thing. I don't care. This is...
[9908.58s -> 9917.75s]  what is this? Oh, this is one of those... this is one of those Japanese sodas, right? This is the
[9917.75s -> 9925.99s]  thing where you like you punch the thing down and like bloop! Like the flavor goes in. It is, right?
[9927.78s -> 9937.05s]  Okay. These are okay. These... I don't know if I... it's weird though. You don't really ever have an
[9937.05s -> 9943.83s]  opportunity to drink these. Like why do you drink soda or liquid? Oh, I'm thirsty. I want to quench
[9943.83s -> 9950.49s]  my thirst. This is more like a game than it is like drinking a soda. It's more like a, oh look
[9950.49s -> 9955.13s]  at how cool that looks. Not like I can't wait to drink a Coke right now. It's like, yeah, it's fun.
[9962.22s -> 9967.90s]  That's... but I would put Baja Blast in that same category. I don't like go... I don't drink Baja
[9967.90s -> 9976.30s]  Blast, but if you go to Taco Bell, it's like, oh, the like teal green one. Yeah, I'll take that one.
[9976.30s -> 9980.22s]  Oh yeah, this is fun. It's for fun. These are the ones for fun, and they belong up at sea.
[9980.78s -> 9993.43s]  There's no other scenario where I get this. Plus, I don't think you even get them. Can of Pepsi?
[9993.43s -> 9998.09s]  Doesn't it... I mean, what's the... made with real sugar? This is a joke. This is... this is just like
[9998.09s -> 10007.59s]  the look... look at how healthy we are when we're not healthy at all. Doesn't matter. Made with real
[10007.59s -> 10020.62s]  sugar this time. It's still... it's still a Pepsi. You know, it probably is better than the regular
[10020.62s -> 10033.32s]  one. Okay, what is this one? Is this Diet? That looks like Diet to me, and it's making me angry,
[10033.32s -> 10054.31s]  so it's going down here. Now, the rest of these... I've had Jones Soda before, but I'm not... I don't
[10054.31s -> 10059.19s]  think I've had these enough to really have an opinion on it. Some of these. This one... this is
[10059.19s -> 10063.35s]  pretty good. This is the orange one, right? There's like a lemon lime. Yeah, these are okay. These are
[10063.35s -> 10067.27s]  good. These aren't bad. I'm just trying to remember how much better they are than the other ones.
[10070.90s -> 10078.30s]  I distinctly remember these being very good. Like, potentially like best, but I don't... I haven't had
[10078.30s -> 10084.39s]  them enough times to be able to have... that's not in my memory. I know they're good, but I know
[10084.39s -> 10093.27s]  exactly what a 7-Up tastes like. I can... I can describe it to you. It's the only one that's going
[10093.27s -> 10103.67s]  up there. 7-Up is the best soda in the world. It is. This is the... really the only ginger ale on the
[10103.67s -> 10115.40s]  list. Canada Dry is up there too. Those of you that disagree with this, that's okay. That's all
[10115.40s -> 10120.84s]  right, but just... you got to listen. The next time that you go on an airplane, please, if they have
[10120.84s -> 10133.06s]  it, get a 7-Up with that airplane ice. It enhances the flavor by 45%. Airplane ice and 7-Up... something
[10133.06s -> 10137.94s]  about it. I don't know what it is. It's fucking really good. Because I don't know what's on that
[10137.94s -> 10141.22s]  ice. I don't know if this is like... if that's... it might be toilet water. It could be toilet water ice,
[10141.22s -> 10146.74s]  but there's some combination of like airplane toilet water ice and 7-Up that make it magical.
[10149.58s -> 10154.38s]  It is by far the best soda I would drink it if... and then it's not everywhere either. That's the
[10154.38s -> 10166.18s]  thing. See, all these dickheads... these guys are everywhere. 7-Up is not in every single store.
[10166.18s -> 10171.29s]  You can get a Pepsi literally anywhere. You could get a Pepsi at the doctor's office if you really
[10171.29s -> 10178.14s]  want it to. A 7-Up is a treat. You see it in the cooler and you go, oh fuck, they got 7-Up here.
[10179.16s -> 10182.36s]  Give me... give me like seven of them. And you like stuff it in your fucking arm and go to the
[10182.36s -> 10192.76s]  checkout. We buy it at the grocery store. That's not fun. I can get 7-Up at my dentist office.
[10193.40s -> 10199.19s]  There's a reason why 7-Up is hard to find. It's because it's just selling out. People are just
[10199.19s -> 10204.36s]  buying so many of them. Because it's the best airplane soda. You know how many people fly on
[10204.36s -> 10208.68s]  airplanes every day? How many... okay, somebody calculate how many people are flying on an airplane
[10208.68s -> 10214.50s]  today? And how many of those people are drinking a 7-Up right now? It's got to be a lot. There are
[10214.50s -> 10219.54s]  like 5,000 airplanes that are flying around right now. That's at least... how many passengers are on
[10219.54s -> 10225.30s]  an airplane? Like a typical... like an Airbus or a 747 or whatever. There's probably like three... two
[10225.30s -> 10230.78s]  or three hundred people on a plane? Something like that. 100 people? 200? So 200 times 5,000.
[10230.78s -> 10234.78s]  That's five, 10, 20, 25... that's like... let's just say there's like 200... let's just say there's like
[10234.78s -> 10238.94s]  400,000 people flying around the plane right now. And like 40% of that... you got like 20... there's
[10238.94s -> 10251.34s]  like probably 190,000 people drinking a 7-Up right now on an airplane. Definitely. More than that.
[10251.34s -> 10258.74s]  Where do they get those numbers? I don't know. This is like... I'm just... I'm just spitballing.
[10260.07s -> 10267.70s]  This is an open spitball platform here. I don't... I don't got a... I don't got a guy over there
[10268.71s -> 10272.31s]  with like four laptops and like two fucking Google searches open.
[10273.45s -> 10279.24s]  Hey, what... how many people are on a plane today? No, it's just me. It's just me and you. And all
[10279.24s -> 10295.11s]  these gross teeth rotting beverages. There's nobody else. Just the two of us. Times a couple...
[10295.11s -> 10300.89s]  a hundred or a thousand people. Water is the S tier? Yeah, but it's not listed on here.
[10301.53s -> 10305.13s]  All right, let's go back. This is our... these... I remember... these are really, really good, but I
[10305.13s -> 10309.69s]  can't put them above anything else. I don't think I've ever had these. I've never had sausage soda
[10309.69s -> 10321.11s]  before, I don't think. All right. Nope. Wait. Make sure I look good. Okay. 7-Up I think is the best
[10321.11s -> 10381.85s]  on this list. Canada Dry and NW both A tier. Might have to move... not as good. Close. Too...
[10381.85s -> 10386.73s]  too sugary, I think, to me. I just... I just tried it. I just tried it in my internal mind, and I
[10386.73s -> 10405.93s]  think it was too sugary. These are all very sugary. Very, very sweet. Um, I think this is good. I don't
[10405.93s -> 10411.42s]  think I need to change anything. Although, let me put all the diet ones at the very bottom.
[10411.42s -> 10416.66s]  Because this is diet, right? It's like diet cherry vanilla Dr. Pepper, right?
[10422.10s -> 10429.75s]  Yeah, definitely. Like, diet Pepsi is probably the worst drink. Cherry Pepsi is in the trash?
[10435.90s -> 10457.18s]  Yeah. Yeah, it is. I have had this before. I've had this before. No, I'm not. I don't like the cherry...
[10458.52s -> 10461.64s]  like, cherry Coke is all right, but no, it's not up there very high.
[10462.52s -> 10469.45s]  Cherry Coke is okay. I don't remember this being something that I really liked.
[10478.73s -> 10506.60s]  Done. They're just... done. I'm happy with it. Meats. Why is there meats? There's a Taco Bell menu
[10506.60s -> 10510.28s]  one. I don't even need to do it. There's only one item that belongs up anywhere. You already know
[10510.28s -> 10529.13s]  what it is. You want to do meats? All right, I'll do meats. I'm not doing Jell-O. They're all gross.
[10529.85s -> 10542.04s]  Oh, there's chips. This one's all right, too. I'll do that after. What the fuck is this?
[10542.12s -> 10550.01s]  G Fuel Tier List? Where does Kool-Aid Packets and Pixie Sticks fall on that list?
[10556.87s -> 10565.72s]  All right, well, it's a meat one. I'll take the meat one. Cheez-Its.
[10566.60s -> 10588.18s]  There we go. Meat. Let's try meat. Did I fuck it up? Meats. Okay, this is perfect. This is fine.
[10588.18s -> 10593.64s]  I've had all of these, I think, although I can't really determine what some of them are.
[10596.26s -> 10607.03s]  Uh, bacon is the first one here, and bacon is good, but it's also a meme food.
[10608.70s -> 10612.22s]  Bacon is one of those things that, for some reason, the internet got ahold of it
[10612.78s -> 10617.18s]  and became, like, the coolest fucking thing in the world. Putting bacon on something
[10618.38s -> 10626.65s]  made it cool, even if it wasn't cool at all. Bacon. Oh, whoa! You put bacon on that sandwich.
[10627.13s -> 10638.98s]  Yeah, it's become a big thing. Like, bacon. Okay, let me tell you something. Bacon and the word,
[10639.86s -> 10646.95s]  like, epic, are the same word, right? If you put bacon on something, it makes it epic.
[10646.95s -> 10655.82s]  That's just what happens. Nothing wrong with that. There's no problem with it. It's just,
[10655.82s -> 10664.84s]  that's what, that's just the kind of what happened. I don't find it to be like this god meat
[10665.72s -> 10671.06s]  that people started putting on their ice cream. I don't, I don't think so. I think it's good.
[10671.06s -> 10676.62s]  I like bacon a lot. I eat it all the time, but it's not like, I put bacon on this, therefore,
[10676.62s -> 10687.42s]  now it's the best. It's awesome. No, it's just bacon. I just eat it. Bacon is a condiment to me.
[10688.74s -> 10694.90s]  It's not really, it's a side. It's a condiment. It's like putting mustard on your hamburger.
[10697.27s -> 10707.42s]  You don't, like, oh, hey, guys. Hey, so today, come on in for dinner. I made a bacon. What? No,
[10707.42s -> 10724.76s]  it's, it goes on stuff. It's a side. Yeah, but it's, I'm being a hipster. Wouldn't I be being
[10724.76s -> 10737.38s]  a hipster if I said that bacon is fucking so awesome, epic, cool? That's mainstream.
[10739.48s -> 10767.03s]  Well, you're really going to not like this. Am I still a hipster? Is this salmon? Done. Done.
[10767.03s -> 10775.26s]  Sausage? Wait, chicken? What's this? Fried chicken? What's the difference? Isn't this
[10775.34s -> 10780.62s]  chicken? Is that turkey? Wait, is that a turkey? That's a turkey. No, no, no, no. That doesn't go
[10780.62s -> 10795.22s]  up there. This is pork. This is like a hamburger patty. Hold on. Oh, I'm going to make people angry
[10795.22s -> 10806.84s]  with this. I know I am. It's a ham. I don't like ham. Not really. I think it's, yeah, it's a, I'm
[10806.84s -> 10819.16s]  not a big fan. Also, not a big fan of steak. I do like ribs. I would rather eat a steak than ham,
[10819.16s -> 10831.06s]  though. These ribs. Hold on. I just need to get it on the plate first. I, everybody, hold on. I need
[10831.06s -> 10839.93s]  to just get it on the plate. What is that? Is that like white fish, like cod or haddock or something?
[10839.93s -> 10853.50s]  What is it? I would put that up here. So I'll put sausage here. No. Okay. Is this, what is that?
[10854.14s -> 10867.38s]  Is that lamb? What is this? Brisket? That's, is that brisket? Doesn't look like brisket.
[10867.38s -> 10888.38s]  Is it brisket? That's turkey. No, that's turkey. Maybe it's duck. That, is that duck? That's chicken.
[10888.38s -> 10894.44s]  So what's that? Why is it like different? Is it like fried chicken and regular chicken?
[10895.00s -> 10905.80s]  It's, yeah, it's unclear. I'll take, I'll take a salmon and a 7-up, please. Pork chops? So then
[10905.80s -> 10921.74s]  what is this, though? I don't know what that is. I think this is duck. I'm going to say that's duck.
[10921.74s -> 10939.86s]  Okay, now hold on. Would I rather eat ham or duck? No. I don't like duck. That's too gamey. I don't
[10939.86s -> 10950.30s]  like it. Would I rather eat like pork cutlets or cutlets over steak? I would eat cutlets. Sausage
[10950.30s -> 10959.27s]  over, yeah, I like, I like sausage. Hamburger over, this is, is this, what is this? Is this chicken
[10959.27s -> 10962.39s]  cutlet? This is pork cutlet right here. So that's chicken cutlet. Is this chicken cutlet? Is this
[10962.39s -> 10969.43s]  pork cutlet? I'm going to say this is pork cutlet and this is chicken cutlet just from my brain,
[10969.43s -> 10977.93s]  and they could be wrong. I'm pretty sure that pork is this one. I would rather eat a hamburger
[10980.25s -> 10987.13s]  than pork. Yes, I probably would. Bacon, it's just a fucking condiment. I'm putting it on the list.
[10987.13s -> 10995.45s]  I'm just going to be condiments. How can you put like bacon over a hamburger? It's, that's not,
[10996.01s -> 11004.97s]  this is mustard. Would I rather eat, I'd rather eat chicken,
[11005.69s -> 11016.33s]  turkey, salmon. I think this is good. Tofu, I find to be just something I never want to have.
[11018.70s -> 11028.66s]  It's weird. It's, I just don't, I don't like it. I really don't. I actually really don't like soy,
[11028.66s -> 11037.72s]  like anything, really at all. I don't like soy milk. I don't like soy, like tofu. I don't like,
[11041.10s -> 11048.95s]  it's just that I don't like it. It doesn't do it for me. But I do, I do also not like steak.
[11050.65s -> 11054.73s]  I wouldn't order steak at a restaurant. If I had an opportunity, it would be something up here.
[11054.73s -> 11068.89s]  It wouldn't be a steak. No, I'd rather eat steak than ham. But I'm a, I'm a, I'm a fly and fish
[11068.89s -> 11073.21s]  kind of person. Salmon is probably my favorite meat. Or, you know, turkey probably would be my
[11073.21s -> 11078.01s]  favorite if it was easy to get all the time and easy to make. Salmon is really easy to make.
[11078.01s -> 11082.76s]  Turkey's not easy to make. If you want to make like a fucking Thanksgiving turkey, it takes like
[11083.40s -> 11099.83s]  a day to make it. You can make this in five minutes. Would I rather have like a piece of
[11099.83s -> 11107.35s]  cod or a hamburger? Hamburger. It's still up here though, but does it, but yeah, no,
[11107.91s -> 11124.09s]  yep, no. Learn to cook turkey. You forgot forehead. Salmon, turkey, chicken, hamburger meat,
[11125.11s -> 11135.86s]  whitefish, chicken cutlets, bacon, bacon, ribs, sausage, pork cutlets, and then steak, ham,
[11136.42s -> 11148.33s]  duck, and tofu. Bring it on. What's next? Why are ribs and steak so low? I'm not a big red meat fan.
[11148.33s -> 11156.18s]  I like burgers and I like meatballs. And that's kind of it. Game of Thrones characters? No,
[11156.18s -> 11181.34s]  that's like spoilers. Not seeing one I want to do yet. Best pop tarts? It's s'mores pop tarts.
[11182.70s -> 11201.67s]  Discussion over. Chips. Chips is a good one. I'll do chips. Is this the full list here? This doesn't
[11201.67s -> 11211.67s]  look like a full list to me. Is this a full list? This is not. This is not enough on here.
[11215.98s -> 11231.80s]  Ultra tier? No. Epic American chips. That's not, you just made that. You just made that.
[11231.80s -> 11241.64s]  Is bacon on there? Epic American chips. Yeah, this is, this is a, I want a bigger list.
[11247.69s -> 11253.22s]  Why do I feel like this is a smaller list? Like you gave, you gave me a bunch of like
[11253.22s -> 11269.69s]  Smash Brothers clones. Is this, is this, this is not in a variety here. It's just all Cheetos,
[11269.69s -> 11281.35s]  Doritos and Lay's. Where are the Pringles? Okay. Where are the Munchos? I don't see them on this
[11281.35s -> 11301.13s]  list. Chip tiers. I got another one. Hold on. All right. Hold on. This is a little bit more.
[11302.01s -> 11309.10s]  They're on this list. All right. I think this is the one. Combos are on here too. All right.
[11309.10s -> 11318.15s]  This is better. This is better. Yeah, this is better. All right. Right. We got baked Lay's on
[11318.15s -> 11338.78s]  here. Baked Lay's not on here. Yeah, no baked Lay's, no Cape Cod. What's this one? Do snacks? Wait,
[11338.78s -> 11351.06s]  you can add? Can I add stuff? Cape Cod are Zoomer chips. Cape Cod has been a chip
[11351.06s -> 11382.89s]  brand since I was like fucking four years old. Zoomer chips. Is this one better? All right. Okay.
[11386.57s -> 11394.44s]  Cape Cod is a Redditor chip. Oh, this is the list we're doing because I already know which one is
[11394.44s -> 11411.27s]  this. Oh yeah. Yeah. Holy shit. Those things are amazing. You never had those before. Don't let the,
[11411.27s -> 11417.19s]  don't let the title fool you. These are fucking amazing. They're so good. With baked Lay's,
[11417.19s -> 11423.05s]  it's going to be a fight up here. It's going to be a, it's going to be a brawl up in this,
[11423.05s -> 11426.33s]  in the S-rank. I can't have more than one or two, but it's going to be a fight up there.
[11428.25s -> 11440.36s]  Goldfish is definitely A or B tier. Where are those munchos? No munchos on this list, huh?
[11450.14s -> 11462.34s]  Fuck. No. This is going to be a fight up here. I, hold on. It's actually going to be easier to
[11462.34s -> 11491.85s]  go bottom up with this. These taste like dog food. All Lay's brand that are not baked Lay's go down
[11491.85s -> 11501.72s]  in D because they're fine. They're fine. But once you eat two thirds of the bag, you're just left
[11501.72s -> 11512.09s]  with a greasy fucking bread crumbs. The bag is full and it's this fucking big. The bag is huge.
[11514.10s -> 11518.98s]  Down here are the chips. Here's the layer of ones that have not been sat on by like a fat
[11518.98s -> 11527.83s]  guy on a plane. Making lots of plane references today. Under there is just bread crumbs. I'm sorry.
[11529.43s -> 11535.19s]  I do like, but look, I'm not a Lay's hater. I got baked Lay's up in the best chips that I've ever
[11535.19s -> 11543.59s]  had. It's the classic ones. It's the classic, just greasy ones. Any more of those? Cause they're going
[11543.59s -> 11555.14s]  right there. Bugles, F. No, I don't like them. Bugles tastes like cereal without any like sugar
[11555.78s -> 11561.42s]  on them. They just taste like, like just did nothing. It just has, it tastes like air.
[11561.42s -> 11581.00s]  It's just eating dry air. I eat dry air every day here anyways in Vegas. I also really, really do
[11581.00s -> 11591.08s]  not like the Ruffles brand, like the Ruffles. No, I don't like these either. Tostitos. This is an
[11591.08s -> 11595.80s]  interesting thing here because Tostitos are nothing without salsa or queso. So I don't know if they
[11595.80s -> 11602.02s]  belong on this list. Are these just standard default, just eat tortilla chips out of the bag
[11602.02s -> 11612.15s]  or am I implying that I'm eating these with salsa or queso? Are we implying that I'm enjoying them
[11612.15s -> 11623.48s]  with salsa? Just the chip, just alone without the chip, without it. Well then, I mean, I would never
[11623.48s -> 11632.49s]  do that. I would never eat Tostitos unless I was dipping it in some type of viscous fluid that had
[11632.49s -> 11636.65s]  like a spicy or cheesy flavor to it. No, I would not do that. I'm not going to do that. Why would
[11636.65s -> 11647.58s]  I do that? I'm just not going to do that, regardless of how they taste. I'm sorry. These are the ones
[11647.58s -> 11652.06s]  that taste, which are the, we're the dog food ones. Yeah, no, these are all the Frito heavily
[11652.06s -> 11657.34s]  flavored. That's a heavy spice, heavy flavoring. They're just cat food, dog food. I can't eat them.
[11660.87s -> 11666.12s]  Regular Fritos though, those are, those are good. Hey, can you focus here? Come on, what's going on?
[11666.12s -> 11685.72s]  Camera. Focus. We're just the default Doritos. There they are. This is going to take some
[11685.72s -> 11693.14s]  revisions. Doritos Jacked. I don't, I wouldn't, I don't want these. I would never buy them.
[11694.89s -> 11701.90s]  This is like Doritos Chili Lime. I would never buy them. I like Cool Ranch less than I like
[11703.32s -> 11711.06s]  the regular Doritos. I just wouldn't buy, I don't, I'm not going to eat, I'm not going to eat these.
[11712.52s -> 11718.76s]  I am actually a sucker for these. I love the compilations. Pretzel Cheese Squares.
[11720.44s -> 11727.85s]  Like Sun Chip, I love because you get a little bit of everything. So I like having that. Although
[11728.57s -> 11736.65s]  I would never buy these. In fact, this is at the very bottom. All Sun Chips are at the very bottom.
[11742.22s -> 11753.02s]  Yeah, they are. No, I dare, once you eat one of these, if I had one, then I would be done.
[11754.23s -> 11760.34s]  Eating more than three, four, five, or six Sun Chips, they just start, it doesn't, it just starts
[11760.34s -> 11768.82s]  to taste strange. If it's my first chip, this is up here, but it's eating like at least, I'm going
[11768.82s -> 11776.18s]  to say like a half, like a couple dozen. I wouldn't sit down and eat a whole bag of these. I would eat
[11776.18s -> 11780.97s]  a whole bag. In fact, I've done it before many times. I have gotten the normal regular size
[11780.97s -> 11786.23s]  Bake Lays and I'm talking within the last couple of weeks. Now I'm like, oh, I've done that before.
[11786.23s -> 11789.99s]  Like, no, I did this like two weeks ago. I ate the whole bag. I do it all the time.
[11791.54s -> 11799.50s]  I wouldn't do that with these. Um, which, what are these? Which one of these?
[11800.87s -> 11811.78s]  Moldy Doritos. I don't, I don't, I wouldn't get them. I don't know. It's like something all over.
[11813.26s -> 11822.23s]  Cheetos. Um, I would put Cheetos up in it. The regular, like the asymmetrical Cheetos.
[11822.23s -> 11829.18s]  I like more than the puff ones. So yeah. Flamin' Hot. I'm not a fan. I'd rather just give me the
[11829.18s -> 11839.35s]  regular ones. Flamin' Hot. Not only does Flamin' Hot taste worse to me, but it increases the amount
[11839.35s -> 11846.15s]  of shit on your hands by at least twice, two or three times. I will eat Flamin' Hot Cheetos.
[11847.32s -> 11853.88s]  You fucking have to wash your hands. It's awful. And I don't know why that's considered a good
[11853.88s -> 11858.86s]  thing. Oh dude, like I got so much Cheeto, like the Flamin' Hot dust on my hands. Why don't they
[11858.86s -> 11863.70s]  make it so it's not, they're not like that. Nobody wants to do that. Where can you eat those? Where
[11863.70s -> 11874.06s]  can you reliably eat Flamin' Hot Cheetos? You have to be like in your bathroom. It's part of the
[11874.06s -> 11882.97s]  trademark. Dirty hands. But it's something with Flamin' Hot. The regular Cheetos don't really,
[11882.97s -> 11889.02s]  they do that a little bit. But you may as well have like fucking murdered somebody after you eat
[11889.02s -> 11897.05s]  Flamin' Hot Cheetos. You're like a blood all over you. And no, I'm not going to lick the, like,
[11897.45s -> 11900.89s]  you know what the fucking hands have been on a daily basis? You want to talk about like, like
[11900.89s -> 11906.41s]  getting sick and how we need to be more health conscious? Yeah. Put your hands as far down in
[11906.41s -> 11914.86s]  your mouth as you can over and over again. That's a great idea. No, that's like so like bizarre.
[11915.50s -> 11922.26s]  You got to like, yeah, you got to wash your hands. But what if you're not in your bathroom? What if
[11922.26s -> 11927.94s]  you're walking down the street with a bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos? Okay, you've eaten like 20
[11928.58s -> 11934.34s]  of them now. What do you do? What do you do? You're walking around, where are you? What do you do?
[11937.16s -> 11948.46s]  You, yeah. And then you go like this. That's better. Or like, yeah, that's better. That's
[11948.46s -> 11963.08s]  sanitary. Just pour the bag in your mouth. Eat them with chopsticks. These do that, but these do that
[11963.08s -> 11972.04s]  way more. Therefore, they're at the bottom of the list. Chex Mix, mid-tier. I like this style more
[11972.04s -> 11978.23s]  than I like Chex Mix. I don't really like Chex. Combos are really good, but combos are actually
[11978.23s -> 11986.62s]  also like really bad too. You can only get these at like gas stations. So there's something going
[11986.62s -> 12003.93s]  on there. Goldfish Flavor Blasted is just the same complaint that I have about, ow, my hand.
[12003.93s -> 12010.36s]  That hurts so fucking much. That hurt a lot. And I'm gonna complain about it. Flavor Blasted
[12010.36s -> 12014.84s]  Goldfish are the same thing as Flamin' Hot Cheetos. They just put extra dust on it and
[12016.68s -> 12021.99s]  it's just give me the regular ones. Those ones are better. Funyuns are okay in small doses.
[12021.99s -> 12028.87s]  They're pretty good, although I wouldn't, I don't think I'd put them at B. Cheez-Its are definitely
[12028.87s -> 12035.94s]  a little, they're up here. Now this is, is this Tabasco? Spicy? Because if those are the ones
[12035.94s -> 12040.10s]  they belong up here. I'm not a big fan of any of the other early Cheez-It Brains. I like the hot
[12040.10s -> 12045.70s]  ones. I like the super toasty ones and I like the regular ones. Cheetos Puffs, again, like I said,
[12045.70s -> 12052.58s]  I would rather have these, the regular ones, the asymmetrical crunchy ones over the puffy cloudy
[12052.58s -> 12066.46s]  ones. Oh, those are White Cheddar. Yeah, that may, this may have been a mistake. They belong up here.
[12066.46s -> 12078.30s]  The White Cheddar ones are actually insane. Again, this is like Flamin' Hot Cheeto. Just,
[12078.30s -> 12083.98s]  oh yeah. Do we have a chip? Yes, we do. Do we also have an evil version of those chips?
[12083.98s -> 12097.10s]  We better. Chesters? One of these? I don't know what these are. No, they're the fries, the little
[12097.10s -> 12107.45s]  like, like little hot fries. Where are the hot fries? Why are they not in here? Okay, can I pretend
[12108.49s -> 12119.03s]  that these are the actual hot fries? But can I also pretend that they are the regular cheesy ones,
[12119.03s -> 12123.56s]  not the hot ones? Because that's not on this list. I'm not going to put these up anywhere high.
[12123.56s -> 12132.63s]  I'm pretending that these are the original fries. I don't need to pretend. Are they on here? No,
[12132.63s -> 12139.58s]  not on here. Okay, so that this is, this is hot. These are the regular mild hot fries.
[12141.38s -> 12146.54s]  These go up here. Yeah, they have, they have regular ones. Oh yeah. They're insane. They're
[12146.54s -> 12160.95s]  amazing. They're everything you love about the hot ones, except they're not hot. Just add them. Yeah,
[12160.95s -> 12179.27s]  yeah, the Andy Caps. Andy Caps is the one I'm talking about. I don't know what these are. What's
[12179.27s -> 12190.30s]  going on in here? Taco flavored Doritos? I don't, I don't, I don't think I would want to get those.
[12194.06s -> 12203.29s]  Gordettas. This looks like a little combo mix thing. I think I've had it a few times,
[12203.29s -> 12206.65s]  but I don't really remember. It kind of, it's the same thing as Chex next to me, my brain.
[12208.62s -> 12229.46s]  Salt, salt and vinegar chips are really bad. Just tastes like rotten potato chips.
[12230.02s -> 12246.17s]  It tastes like potato chips that the bag was open. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It just, they're,
[12246.17s -> 12252.46s]  they're just, they're just pee. It's just urine chips. That's just what I think of. I'm sorry.
[12252.46s -> 12256.54s]  It just, it's just urine potato chips. That's, that's it. And that's all I have to say.
[12257.34s -> 12264.31s]  I really, really dialed up the polarization here in chat, and I didn't mean to, but I just,
[12264.31s -> 12284.66s]  I'm being honest. I'm just being honest. I am fucking fuming. I personally disagree,
[12284.66s -> 12293.93s]  but I understand and respect your opinion. All right, we've got Pringles here. There's no normal
[12293.93s -> 12299.05s]  Pringles somehow. There's just sour cream and onion Pringles and pizza Pringles, which I don't
[12299.05s -> 12303.75s]  really like either one of them. In fact, regular Pringles, I think, are not even the best ones.
[12304.71s -> 12325.50s]  I think cheddar Pringles. I think are my favorite. Honey mustard Pringles. I've never had them.
[12325.50s -> 12333.88s]  Those sound good. They sound pretty good. Honey mustard Pringles. I would rather eat any Pringles
[12333.88s -> 12341.82s]  over any Lay's though. That's for sure. Kettle cooked Lay's. I mean, we already have the,
[12341.82s -> 12349.08s]  I mean, these, I wouldn't even, I don't want these. These are essentially the same idea,
[12349.08s -> 12352.28s]  except these ones have barbecue sauce on them. These ones are just better.
[12354.98s -> 12361.42s]  Um, pork skins. I've never had these before. I actually need to put like another, hold on,
[12361.42s -> 12367.74s]  let me do another row of, I've never had this before because this is at least, at least
[12367.74s -> 12379.96s]  six of these that I have actually really never eaten. Never had. I've never had these Doritos.
[12380.84s -> 12392.55s]  I've never had whatever these are. I don't, I've never had them. I don't know if I've ever had
[12392.55s -> 12401.16s]  these. I have this weird memory of me eating them, but I don't think so. Uh, the rest of these,
[12401.16s -> 12406.92s]  I've never had these pork skins. I've never had like these hot and spicy. I've seen these before
[12407.56s -> 12413.05s]  because they always say that they're two dollars. It's printed on the bag everywhere,
[12413.05s -> 12428.68s]  but I never had them. I've never had these. I've never had these and these are bad. It's just,
[12428.68s -> 12433.56s]  it's like, it's just, it's maybe, you eat saltines. It's just a saltine 2.0.
[12436.04s -> 12443.85s]  I don't know. What are these? Potato sticks? I don't think I've ever had those.
[12444.41s -> 12454.23s]  So let's start from the bottom. Which one of these that I really don't like what I've,
[12454.23s -> 12469.30s]  what I want to eat the most? Probably these. No, I don't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't choose those over
[12469.30s -> 12473.94s]  any of these. Probably, probably Bugles because it's, oh look, it's weird and I haven't had these
[12473.94s -> 12478.18s]  in 10 years and oh wow, I can't believe they have these here. That would be the only reason.
[12478.90s -> 12491.22s]  These are the Doritos flavors. I would probably try them. Like I've had them a couple times.
[12491.22s -> 12495.46s]  It would be like, ah, I guess, okay, if there was like, if there was a Doritos shortage
[12495.46s -> 12501.48s]  and I really wanted Doritos and I had to get them, I had to eat them, it would be those.
[12502.20s -> 12510.97s]  I don't want this, the hot Mr. Munchies. The Tostitos would be all the way, all the way at
[12510.97s -> 12516.52s]  the bottom. Triscuits Tostitos would be at the very bottom because it just, you need all those,
[12517.16s -> 12523.70s]  you can't enjoy triscuits without like a piece of cheese or a piece of pepperoni on it. We,
[12523.70s -> 12529.00s]  this is implied and this is, I asked you guys this. Eating Tostitos without salsa is just,
[12529.00s -> 12533.96s]  I don't, it's just a cracker. Eating triscuits without like a pepperoni on it or like a little,
[12534.52s -> 12538.76s]  like a spread or some, or like a dip is, I wouldn't want to do, I wouldn't do that.
[12539.48s -> 12549.93s]  I wouldn't, I'm sorry, I just wouldn't do it. Crackers are good, but if I'm at the grocery
[12549.93s -> 12556.44s]  store I'm not going to go. Triscuits, get them in the cart. I can't wait to eat a handful of those,
[12557.16s -> 12570.34s]  like 20 of them today, right now. I'm, no. Do I know how pepperoni is made?
[12573.00s -> 12583.61s]  I don't know, some guy, some, some guy in a pizza restaurant, like sings and then they,
[12583.61s -> 12593.99s]  they just appear on the plate I guess. I don't know. Lime Tostitos are the worst.
[12594.71s -> 12607.91s]  Um, are these, these, these are original. When I put chips in the sandwich, I used to do that
[12607.91s -> 12616.20s]  until I got hurt. I used to put potato chips in my tuna sandwich until one day I took a bite
[12616.20s -> 12620.60s]  and it literally like pierced up into my mouth and I said that I'm never going to do that again.
[12621.48s -> 12627.54s]  It hurt me. I got hurt. Okay, so that's, this is done. I would not want to eat these.
[12628.50s -> 12633.29s]  I really don't like salt and vinegar. I really don't. Okay, the D. These are ones that I would
[12633.29s -> 12644.09s]  eat, but I wouldn't choose, right? I would eat these, but I wouldn't choose these. That's where
[12644.09s -> 12659.22s]  I put D. Fuck, I wouldn't choose any of these. These are all on the same level, so do not be
[12659.22s -> 12665.06s]  fooled by this list going kind of descending down this way. No, they're all the same. I wouldn't get
[12665.06s -> 12669.22s]  any of these. I would eat them, but I wouldn't. No, they're all in the same tier for me. All of
[12669.22s -> 12677.10s]  them. Okay, moving on. Now, this is things that I would pick on a rainy day. If it was rainy outside
[12677.10s -> 12681.26s]  and I was like, it's fucking raining out. I want to get a snack or something. This is one of those.
[12681.26s -> 12690.42s]  This is like it's sunny out. This is like a rainy shitty day. I think Bake Lays just goes in the
[12690.42s -> 12709.70s]  front just because I would eat Bake Lays no matter what. I would eat combos way before I would eat
[12710.66s -> 12731.14s]  Chex mixes, I think. Yeah, that's good. Yep. I like, I love nachos, Doritos. I don't love Fritos,
[12731.14s -> 12739.96s]  though. This is like a wow, I really like these. I don't really, I don't really like Fritos. This is
[12739.96s -> 12758.01s]  a problem. Yeah, this is a problem. I would, yeah, I would choose Cool Ranch over Barbecue Bake Lays,
[12758.01s -> 12772.06s]  I think. I would eat Fritos over, no, I wouldn't. That's accurate. Yeah, I would definitely choose
[12772.06s -> 12784.47s]  Fritos over Chex Mix. This is, I don't think I need to change anything here. This is where it's
[12784.47s -> 12790.94s]  going to get hard. All right, this is the difficult part, trying to decide which actually is my
[12790.94s -> 12801.69s]  favorite, like snack. These two are up here. Goldfish come down a little. In fact, I would
[12801.69s -> 12812.31s]  choose, I would choose nacho Doritos over Goldfish. Very small margin, though. Would I choose Cheez-Its
[12812.31s -> 12834.17s]  over Doritos? These are scary. The reason why Goldfish are so scary is because I buy the bucket.
[12834.89s -> 12842.94s]  Do you know the giant, like fucking high school milk carton? I buy the big one, the one that's
[12842.94s -> 12849.75s]  supposed to feed like 40 people, and you just, you sit there and you're watching TV or a movie,
[12850.63s -> 12861.32s]  and you eat like 25 people's worth of servings in those, they're dangerous. Why do I have Cape
[12861.32s -> 12867.24s]  Cod so high if I don't like Kettle Chips? I love Kettle Chips. I just, I just don't like the, the
[12867.24s -> 12876.36s]  bar, I just really don't like barbecue, uh, Lay's Kettle Chips. I wouldn't like choose these. I don't,
[12876.36s -> 12882.62s]  I don't like, I'm not a big like barbecue chip fan, if that's been clear, I guess. The only reason
[12882.62s -> 12893.16s]  why these are up here is because they're baked. You have garbage tastes. Why are Baked Lay's an S?
[12893.16s -> 12902.07s]  Because Baked Lay's have my favorite chip. And Smartfood is actually about to go up because I'm
[12902.07s -> 12905.27s]  trying to figure out how, what my top three are going to be, and then me just sitting here,
[12905.27s -> 12922.18s]  I figured it out. Why is your opinion different than mine? Smartfood is fucking delicious. It's
[12922.18s -> 12928.71s]  that, it's white cheddar popcorn. Remember when everybody freaked out when white cheddar Cheez-Its
[12928.71s -> 12940.58s]  were over here? What? What? Smartfood is white cheddar popcorn. It's insane. Come on. Smartfood,
[12940.58s -> 12950.23s]  there's got to be some people that agree here. It's fake popcorn. It's just, I don't know why
[12950.23s -> 12959.94s]  a company would make fake popcorn when popcorn is the world's cheapest thing to produce. Why would
[12959.94s -> 12974.38s]  you fake something? It would probably cost more money to fake than to make popcorn. What do you
[12974.38s -> 12981.94s]  think is in there? No, I think it's plastic. It would be like four dollars a bag. It's bones.
[12982.81s -> 12995.86s]  Popcorn. Popcorn. Pop popcorn. There? Are we happy? What would you put up on S? I'm just curious.
[12995.86s -> 13007.58s]  Sun Chips? The only place where Sun Chips belong are in a big bowl at a fucking retirees party.
[13008.54s -> 13014.30s]  And guess what? I really hate to say this to you, but that bowl is going to be just as full
[13014.30s -> 13025.46s]  six hours later when parties are. What else? What do you want? What do you want up there?
[13026.10s -> 13033.16s]  What do you want up there? Funyuns? I've got nothing on Funyuns. They're actually pretty good.
[13046.44s -> 13051.53s]  I told you this wasn't going to be easy. Don't even come talk shit about rolled golds.
[13052.41s -> 13056.57s]  I will delete the stream. I will turn the stream off and delete it. I will delete the VOD.
[13057.37s -> 13060.57s]  And then I'll re-upload the VOD on YouTube and edit that part out of you guys talking about it.
[13062.49s -> 13066.73s]  If you don't think rolled golds, pretzels belong up here, then I'm sorry. You and I have an
[13066.73s -> 13087.62s]  extreme disagreement. You like cheese. You just like cheese. Smart food. White cheddar.
[13088.76s -> 13093.78s]  That's not accurate. Cheetah. In fact, I'm seeing something right now that I don't like.
[13099.37s -> 13112.38s]  I would choose goldfish over Cheetos so that it doesn't belong down there. I actually would
[13112.38s -> 13122.66s]  probably rather eat like 30 people's worth of goldfish over cheeses. Oh, he's climbing.
[13122.66s -> 13126.74s]  He's climbing up there. What's the next Mortal Kombat contestant? What's up? Rolled gold?
[13127.62s -> 13132.74s]  Was it Shang Tsung? Oh, he's taking them on. He's done. I would rather eat goldfish than rolled
[13132.74s -> 13145.91s]  golds. What we got left? We got fuck. We got Goro and then we got Shao Kahn. I would rather eat the
[13145.91s -> 13201.54s]  hot fries though. It's not S tier. It's not. It's very close. I'm having second thoughts about
[13201.54s -> 13209.06s]  those like Andy Capps fries because if you look at the back of those fries, this is like fucking
[13209.06s -> 13216.20s]  500 ingredients. It's something crazy. The amount of shit that's on the back of that container
[13216.92s -> 13220.20s]  is like too much. It's like laundry detergent amount of shit that's in there,
[13221.64s -> 13236.76s]  but they're fucking good. Wow. You're so healthy. Were you present for the cereal segment an hour
[13236.76s -> 13253.35s]  ago? I was not. Check that out. There's plenty of cereals in there that people thought I was like
[13253.35s -> 13274.55s]  a fucking eight-year-old for liking. Done. Done. It's done. Wait. Done. Am I okay with that? I'm
[13274.55s -> 13299.08s]  okay with that. Done. Done. Done. Now it's done. Utz is not on the list. I know it's unfortunate.
[13299.08s -> 13305.18s]  Munchos aren't on this list either. Munchos would have been up here. See, the reason why SmartFood
[13305.18s -> 13311.26s]  is here is because Munchos are not on the list. I am replacing Munchos with SmartFood. SmartFood
[13311.26s -> 13321.66s]  would be down here, but it has to be up here because I have memories. Baked Lays I get every
[13321.66s -> 13327.11s]  single time I go to the grocery store. Every single time. They're the perfect little snack.
[13327.11s -> 13332.87s]  I love them. Veggie straws. There are people that are Mr. Healthy talking shit to me right now,
[13332.87s -> 13337.88s]  but if you've never had these before, they're so light and you could eat a thousand of them.
[13338.52s -> 13345.80s]  They're really good. Try it one time. And a Goldfish is just a classic. That's a classic
[13345.80s -> 13351.86s]  snack. It has to be up there. You can take a handful of these straws and just they're very
[13351.86s -> 13357.94s]  crunchy. They're very, very light. It's not vegetables. It's like potato starch. They're
[13357.94s -> 13377.59s]  really good. They cost too much. They are kind of expensive, aren't they? Finalists. Veggie straws
[13377.59s -> 13385.16s]  start tasting bad the more that you eat them. If I try Takis, you'll get veggie straws. If it's
[13385.16s -> 13393.80s]  available, I don't know if Las Vegas grocery stores stock Takis. I've never seen them before.
[13396.38s -> 13405.98s]  Amazon Prime them. Oh yeah, you can do that. You can look just like Amazon. But what,
[13405.98s -> 13411.88s]  I'm just going to Amazon a bag of chips? I would have to get like a box of them.
[13413.64s -> 13417.72s]  I'm like, you're going to tell me I'm going to Amazon Prime two-day shipping, a bag of chips.
[13419.98s -> 13429.66s]  That's like, I'm going to go to the grocery store for that. Overnight. No, that's like
[13429.66s -> 13442.87s]  Postmating or Uber Eatsing a Gatorade. No, I'm not going to do that. All right,
[13442.87s -> 13452.63s]  we got any more? I'll do, I've been going for a long time here. Okay, we'll do,
[13453.51s -> 13465.45s]  time is getting late. We'll do one more. One more. One more decent one. It's been about,
[13465.45s -> 13474.97s]  what, seven and a half, eight hours or so? It's been a while. Video game, what is this? Video
[13474.97s -> 13485.74s]  game tier list? Oh, like consoles? I'll do a console list. This sounds good. Is this a good,
[13485.90s -> 13507.67s]  we got a good one? Like a full console list? All games, every game list. Door handles? All right,
[13507.67s -> 13520.33s]  let's see what this one is. Video game consoles. Okay, we'll do this one. We can do this again.
[13520.33s -> 13525.99s]  We can do, I have fun doing these. This is fun. This is not, I'm not, I'm not enjoying this.
[13525.99s -> 13531.11s]  This is great. I'm having a good time. This is like the new GeoGuessr for the next like three weeks.
[13532.86s -> 13539.78s]  All right, so I'm a Super Nintendo, I'm a Nintendo person. I wasn't like a, I wasn't a Sega person
[13539.78s -> 13549.50s]  when I was younger, so take that bias into account. All right, where are we? Super Nintendo,
[13549.50s -> 13561.32s]  there it is. The best console that's ever been made. I need F tier because this thing was just
[13561.32s -> 13570.54s]  looking at the sun. Add a row below and needs to be like F. Or like, I need to make another one
[13570.54s -> 13586.63s]  that's like I never played it. So this is F, F, and I need to be, come on, capital. F and then I
[13586.63s -> 13595.48s]  never played or didn't own. No, I never played because I played some of these and never owned
[13595.48s -> 13614.47s]  them. No, I never played. Never played. This is, color has to change. All right, we're good.
[13615.27s -> 13623.24s]  What are you guys saying? How many consoles did I own? Well, we're gonna do those first. We're
[13623.24s -> 13629.30s]  gonna do the consoles that I actually owned. Original, is this original Game Boy? I mean,
[13629.46s -> 13637.58s]  Game Boy. For what it was, it was really good. It was one of the first real mobile kind of platforms.
[13637.58s -> 13649.58s]  The original Game Boy I loved. Belongs on B. Is this like a slip and slide or is this a console?
[13649.58s -> 13659.61s]  I don't know what this is. This looks like a jumpy house. I probably never played. What is this? What
[13659.61s -> 13670.58s]  are these? Genesis. I thought the Genesis wasn't very good. It was the sounds of the Genesis that
[13670.58s -> 13677.96s]  did it for me. Didn't have good sound effects. All the sounds and the music in Genesis all had that
[13677.96s -> 13689.62s]  weird like, you know, those, you guys know what I'm talking about. I know at least some of you do.
[13693.34s -> 13697.58s]  Super Nintendo had superior sound because Super Nintendo obviously that they got their sound
[13697.58s -> 13702.78s]  from Sony. Sony helped them make the sound. That's why the chip, the sound chip is so much better
[13702.78s -> 13716.89s]  than the Sega Genesis. I wonder how many of you guys knew that one? False? That's not false.
[13719.77s -> 13727.99s]  All right, so what is this? I don't know what that is. And this is like another version of the
[13727.99s -> 13732.71s]  Super Nintendo. This is, is that, that's not Atari. Is that Atari? No, this is Atari down here.
[13734.89s -> 13744.94s]  Regular Nintendo is up here. Nintendo 64 is up here at S. The regular Xbox I'm going to put
[13744.94s -> 13758.73s]  over here. Xbox 360 goes down here because the thing was junk. And I mean like hardware wise.
[13759.45s -> 13767.66s]  All you need, there's a video of the guy cracking the egg in the fucking radiator, man.
[13767.66s -> 13780.41s]  Come on. This, the thing was a D. Gamecube. Hold on. This is important. Is this the Wii U? Definitely
[13780.41s -> 13793.32s]  F. Um, is it a game and watch? I never had one. PlayStation 1. Oh, here comes the fight up here.
[13797.03s -> 13808.57s]  Dreamcast fucking sucks. Laughing my ass off. It's definitely a C. Well, the Dreamcast fucking
[13808.57s -> 13816.31s]  sucks. LMAO. I will never forget that. I like, I sometimes, I'll be in the shower and I will just
[13816.31s -> 13826.46s]  think of the all lowercase text. The Dreamcast fucking sucks. LMAO. I will never forget it.
[13826.46s -> 13838.84s]  It's burned forever in my brain and it makes me laugh in the shower. This is the Ouya? Is that the
[13838.84s -> 13850.82s]  Ouya? The Ouya? Did this thing even release? Wait, aren't these things worth like 500 bucks now
[13850.82s -> 13860.71s]  because like nobody has them anymore? These things are worth a shitload now, right? I swear to God,
[13860.71s -> 13865.59s]  I thought, I heard that that Ouya is like a collector's item because they're just liquidated.
[13868.41s -> 13883.19s]  It's the beanie baby of consoles. Switch is really good. It's just, it is. I had my doubts at first
[13883.19s -> 13889.22s]  and I like, I was a kind of, I was kind of a shit talker at first, but it's, it's pretty,
[13889.22s -> 13901.24s]  it's pretty great. PS2 is just one of the, there's so many good consoles. Well, let's get rid of the
[13901.24s -> 13915.26s]  dumb ones. Is that a, where's the Sega CD? Virtual Boy F. Is this a Sega Master System? The thing was
[13915.26s -> 13932.82s]  pretty cool actually. I had one of these, but we're talking about the best. PS3 was, PS3 wasn't really
[13932.82s -> 13945.19s]  that good. It was, it was, but I mean, these two just, they had a bunch of problems. I think we'd
[13945.19s -> 13951.38s]  like to forget about just how many issues this generation of consoles really truly had. They were
[13951.38s -> 13960.47s]  kind of dog shit. The hardware and the, some great games came out, but the consoles were just kind of
[13960.47s -> 13974.39s]  bad. There was a lot of issues. It wasn't the, yeah, the PS3 was like 500, 600 bucks at launch.
[13974.39s -> 14001.02s]  Wasn't it something crazy? The Wii. The Wii was fucking awesome. It was. It was 599 bucks.
[14005.37s -> 14012.20s]  It was great. You know how much, how much time I got out of my Wii? So much, so much time.
[14015.54s -> 14022.02s]  Yeah, I did, how much time did I get out of my like PlayStation 3, you know, or my Xbox 360? I got
[14022.02s -> 14027.54s]  time out of it, but this was the console that you just dumped days into because there was so much
[14027.54s -> 14034.42s]  fun stuff you could do. I played hit the fucking ball with the baseball bat for like every day.
[14034.42s -> 14043.61s]  I played Wii Sports every fucking day for like a year. You know how many times I played like
[14043.61s -> 14073.08s]  Viking on Xbox 360 once and I turned it off in two hours? Where's the PS4? Where's the Xbox One?
[14080.84s -> 14089.80s]  In fact, it's really strong. It's struggling right now to not put this up here.
[14094.14s -> 14101.75s]  The PS4 is so good. It's so good. It is fucking, it's so good. The amount of
[14101.75s -> 14107.11s]  exclusive games that they've come up with on this damn thing. The interface is just, it's,
[14107.11s -> 14123.58s]  it's really, really fucking good console. It really is. But is it better than PS1 or the PS2?
[14125.11s -> 14129.11s]  I got every, I got every PlayStation on here. I just, I got every PS, I got every,
[14129.11s -> 14135.37s]  all the PlayStations are on here. That has to go up. It has to. It's too good.
[14135.69s -> 14161.94s]  There's like 5,000 games for the PS2. I did it. I'm not going back on it. PS4 is,
[14164.44s -> 14169.91s]  it's done everything right. The PlayStation has done almost everything right,
[14170.97s -> 14177.64s]  except for a couple of like bumps. Just think of, you gotta, I'm thinking of games and like
[14177.64s -> 14184.31s]  hardware and shit. Think of the games that have come out on PS4 and then go like 10 years ago
[14184.31s -> 14189.54s]  and be like, okay, what are the, there's been some ridiculous games that they put out over
[14189.54s -> 14257.85s]  the last like four or five years. Too many handhelds. The PS2, I know, I know. God damn it.
[14257.85s -> 14266.79s]  Super Nintendo is never going to change. It's going to be number one. I'm trying to think
[14266.79s -> 14284.36s]  the games that I played on PS2 and they changed everything. The Master System was cool. The
[14285.40s -> 14290.97s]  Dreamcast was cool in the Genesis and the Master System, but it wasn't better than the GameCube,
[14290.97s -> 14303.62s]  don't worry. But let me get some other stuff on here. All these may as well just be empty boxes.
[14306.15s -> 14311.53s]  That, what is this thing? I don't, it's just a Super Nintendo. It's like the new version.
[14322.38s -> 14328.60s]  All these other ones. Wait, is this the phone? Which one of these, which one of these is the
[14328.60s -> 14341.10s]  end gauge? Is this the end gauge? That's F. That was what a disaster. Okay, this is Game Boy Advance.
[14342.92s -> 14348.70s]  I like the DS better than the Game Boy Advance. Although this is the 3DS, so I mean the 3DS is just
[14349.42s -> 14364.97s]  a better version of the DS. It's just a bigger screen in 3D. I'm not, I'm not a handheld player.
[14365.69s -> 14374.62s]  I'm not, I don't, I'm not a handheld player. Remember, they're good, but I don't, I don't,
[14374.62s -> 14385.22s]  I don't play them. Let me come back to this. Where's the game gear? Game gear. Where is it?
[14385.22s -> 14402.71s]  Right here? That's a game gear, right? F. F. PSP. Is there, is the PSP down here? Because that's an
[14402.71s -> 14410.89s]  F too. Why is a game gear an F? Because it took like eight AA batteries and in the ride to grandmas
[14411.45s -> 14424.57s]  you'd have to replace them. It's not, it wasn't very good. Where is it? Is this the PSP?
[14425.53s -> 14430.71s]  This is the Vita? I'll give Vita a D because it made itself relevant for like a couple years.
[14433.91s -> 14440.30s]  There's a PSP. F. No, wait, I played Grand Theft Auto on this and it was, it was pretty fun. Okay,
[14440.30s -> 14455.74s]  no, that's a D. High D. No, that's a C. Not better than the DS. Yeah, I played, I played the GTA
[14455.74s -> 14460.86s]  in that and it was like the first time I've ever experienced like a good like full open 3D GTA type
[14460.86s -> 14464.86s]  game on like a handheld and it's the first time they did it. So yeah, whatever. Liberty City Stories,
[14464.86s -> 14486.20s]  whatever it was. Yeah, it belongs there. Okay. But thank fucking God. I would not have remembered
[14486.20s -> 14490.84s]  it. I would have, okay, here's the funny part of what just happened. If that was a thing and I did
[14490.84s -> 14498.04s]  this again, this list would probably would be completely different. This would be the same
[14498.04s -> 14503.08s]  up here, but all these would be completely, it would be completely different because I'd have
[14503.08s -> 14511.48s]  to think about every individual one again. All right. I don't, I never, I don't, this is the,
[14511.48s -> 14515.40s]  this is the Canada console. I don't know what that is. I don't play it. I don't know what it is.
[14516.12s -> 14522.07s]  Where's the, where's the Atari? Atari changed the world. So we're going to use, we're going to put,
[14522.07s -> 14526.55s]  Atari deserves to be somewhere in B. Without the Atari, there is no Dreamcast and without
[14526.55s -> 14530.15s]  no Dreamcast, there is no Game Boy. Without no Game Boy, there is no GameCube. Without no GameCube,
[14530.15s -> 14535.66s]  there is no Wii. Without no Atari, there is no PS4. Therefore, it has to be here, holding the
[14535.66s -> 14547.53s]  anchor down at B. Where's the Phillips CDI? And are we certain that these are not the same console
[14547.53s -> 14575.11s]  taken at a different angle? The photo. I think they are. I don't know what they are. What is this? Is
[14575.11s -> 14587.75s]  this like, this, is this the 32X? Yeah, this is the 32X, isn't it? 32X was just a Genesis 2.0. Or is
[14587.75s -> 14594.98s]  that the Sega CD? They did a weird thing. Sega had a strange console thing where it was like the
[14594.98s -> 14610.25s]  32X and the CD-I were the same console, right? Something weird. What happened? What the fuck was
[14610.25s -> 14622.82s]  that? Did my internet drop? That's weird. It says I did not drop any frames. That's,
[14624.82s -> 14630.15s]  that was weird. Chat just stopped moving and it didn't say I dropped any frames.
[14633.88s -> 14650.98s]  Weird. That's weird. All right, moving on. What is this? Is this, is this the Jaguar?
[14650.98s -> 14670.92s]  I never played the Jaguar. What is this thing? I feel like I don't know what any of these are.
[14672.06s -> 14680.07s]  This is, I don't know, this is like something I would see this in like a 70s. I think this is
[14680.07s -> 14685.19s]  in Space Odyssey. This is, it's old. It's really old. You can tell because it has like cigarette
[14685.19s -> 14691.22s]  fucking stain on it. Somebody smoked in their house. This is like a cigarette console.
[14694.12s -> 14697.72s]  Old as fuck. That's fine. I don't know what it is. I don't know what this thing is.
[14699.18s -> 14716.55s]  I don't know what this is either. What is that? What are all these? I didn't, none of, I don't have
[14716.55s -> 14724.78s]  any recollection at all of playing any of these. So what are these two handhelds? What is, what is
[14724.78s -> 14741.83s]  this handheld right here? The Apple Pippin. The Apple Pippin? That's what the console was named?
[14743.99s -> 14746.95s]  Why would you name your console after the weakest character in Lord of the Rings?
[14747.51s -> 14776.79s]  Why is it not like the Apple Gimli or like the Apple Aragorn? Because Pippin is a type of apple.
[14778.74s -> 14791.11s]  Apple Gandalf. People would have bought it. What the fuck is this? The Apple Gandalf. I would have
[14791.11s -> 14798.18s]  bought it. I would have bought it just to have one because it's fucking stupid. This is the game
[14798.18s -> 14812.86s]  rectangle. Nobody knows what this is. What's this one? This is the Wonder Swan. Okay. Is this the
[14812.86s -> 14822.17s]  Neo Geo? I never played any of these. All right. Let's go up. Oh, by the way, just in case anybody
[14822.17s -> 14835.30s]  was curious, just in case anyone needed to know, Pink is doing a two, two for $49 bra, get one,
[14835.30s -> 14846.06s]  get to buy one. These ads, I thought I had an ad thing on them. All right. They just keep like
[14846.06s -> 14852.42s]  popping in my face. They're doing like the mobile game thing where just every like 10 seconds,
[14852.42s -> 14859.51s]  they just reload the ad to get an impression. All right. What do we got? Oh, I don't like this
[14859.51s -> 14864.31s]  decision. I'm changing it. No, I'm not. I really do believe that's one of the best consoles. Is it?
[14864.31s -> 14872.06s]  No, that's better. Is it that right? That's correct. Yeah. This is, this is good. Wait. No,
[14872.06s -> 14876.78s]  no, no, no. Hold on. Switch is not better than the regular Nintendo. Switch is better than the Wii,
[14876.78s -> 14879.26s]  I think. Switch is better than the Wii. Yes, it is. It's going to have more shelf life. Look,
[14879.26s -> 14886.22s]  it'll last a long time. It'll last like 15 years. The GameCube better than the Game Boy. Atari better
[14886.22s -> 14905.69s]  than the Dreamcast. Way more influential. Microsoft really not doing very well, huh?
[14908.66s -> 14923.56s]  No Microsoft stuff is above C for me. That's weird. This is much lower. I, you know what? I
[14923.56s -> 14934.38s]  actually really didn't hate the 360. This just had a lot of hardware problems. The Xbox One is,
[14935.34s -> 14955.38s]  it's so close to F, I think. If Wii U is F+, Xbox One is close. They just, they really just
[14955.38s -> 14967.24s]  dropped the fucking ball so hard. It's just not very good. I don't think I would put that down
[14967.24s -> 14984.84s]  here though. It's just barely there. It's sad. I haven't used, I have an Xbox One. Well, actually,
[14984.84s -> 14991.77s]  not anymore. I fucking gave it away. I gave it away. That's right. I don't have it anymore.
[14994.81s -> 14999.77s]  Yeah, I haven't used it. I didn't use it for like a couple of years. It just sat in my closet. I had
[14999.77s -> 15010.84s]  no reason to turn it on. So I just, I just wiped it and gave it away. Yeah, I forgot that I even
[15010.84s -> 15027.00s]  had it. All right, so hold on. Let me, I got B that seems correct to me. Where's the DS? DS should
[15027.00s -> 15047.88s]  be up here. Not this one though. No, I feel like they're like the same thing though. If I put like
[15047.88s -> 15066.15s]  the DS at B, I want like that to be at B2, then do it. Yeah, but it may as well just be the same
[15066.15s -> 15085.30s]  thing. Okay, this is B. This is one, two, three, four, five. This is B5. This is B5 too. The Xbox
[15085.30s -> 15094.26s]  better than the Genesis. The PSP was, I can't in, I can't a good conscious say that.
[15094.90s -> 15115.83s]  That the Xbox 360 was worse than the PSP. That feels wrong. I think it belongs like this. That's
[15115.83s -> 15126.41s]  fair because it wasn't bad. It was, it wasn't bad. Just was, it was just kind of normal.
[15132.78s -> 15141.66s]  That's, I'm good with this. All right, PS3 Master System, the Vita, which is the worst console
[15142.46s -> 15154.71s]  that I wouldn't buy or wouldn't want to play. No, it's the Xbox, it's Xbox One. It is. If you
[15154.71s -> 15159.67s]  handed me a Vita right now, I'd say, oh, okay, I guess, yeah, I'll play something. Whatever,
[15159.67s -> 15165.43s]  this is dumb, but I don't really, it's not dumb, but like I don't, okay, fine. If you handed me
[15165.43s -> 15172.28s]  an Xbox One and said, hey, play something, I'd be like, just take it back. Same thing with the
[15172.28s -> 15183.53s]  Game Boy Advance. I'd be like, okay, this is why you're handing me this. Master System 2, it's just
[15183.53s -> 15187.85s]  like, hey dude, here's a Master System. Check it out. There's like four games that were worth
[15187.85s -> 15215.46s]  playing on here. They've been re-released like twice. If Xbox 360 is up here, PS3 has to be
[15215.46s -> 15240.34s]  up here, but lower. And the original Xbox is going down here. This is fair. GBA does not belong in D,
[15241.22s -> 15260.94s]  but I don't, I don't, I don't have anywhere to put it because I can't reliably tell you
[15261.58s -> 15265.74s]  that I would rather play the Game Boy Advance than like the,
[15266.78s -> 15284.90s]  than like the fucking say, oh, hey, how are you? Hey, sorry. My internet turned off.
[15286.98s -> 15295.06s]  It's not like that's a normal occurrence every day. That's so out of the ordinary. I'm shocked
[15295.06s -> 15304.74s]  that it happened. It's absolutely shocking. What the fuck is going on? It's, it's, it's 12 15.
[15304.74s -> 15312.52s]  It's midnight. What is happening that the internet would just turn off? It's midnight.
[15313.66s -> 15321.03s]  Oh, those people playing Call of Duty. No, everyone's asleep. What's, what day is it today?
[15323.22s -> 15331.83s]  What date? What is, what day is it right now? It's fucking Thursday at 12 Pacific. Why would
[15331.83s -> 15359.11s]  the internet just turn off? Anyways, new face. No, I don't, I don't, I don't want to touch my
[15359.11s -> 15364.14s]  face with my like dirty hands. All right. Where were we? Let's finish this up before I get turned
[15364.14s -> 15372.98s]  off again. Computers, man, I swear to God, electricity under the ground and shit. All right.
[15372.98s -> 15378.87s]  What was I, it was a Game Boy Advance. I'll put it up here, but that means I have to downgrade
[15379.51s -> 15385.32s]  the Sega CD because Sega CD was dumb. It was real dumb, but it had a lot of fun novelty.
[15392.63s -> 15397.59s]  We played every single Sega CD game on this stream a couple of years ago, whatever, right?
[15398.63s -> 15404.95s]  It was, it was fantastic. What, what a fun time that was. What a fun time that was, but I would,
[15405.51s -> 15409.03s]  I would be disappointed if that was the console that I owned like 20 years ago.
[15409.75s -> 15417.54s]  Is this the Sega Saturn? Oh, that's the Saturn. I did not know that. Okay. That belongs over here.
[15418.63s -> 15433.40s]  Nevermind. No. Okay. Here's the question. What had less shit on it? What, what had less stuff
[15433.40s -> 15443.80s]  to do? The Sega Saturn or the Xbox One? Both had like a tiny library of stuff. What had less stuff
[15443.80s -> 15450.36s]  to do? It was, yeah, it had to have been said. There was like 12, it was like 16 games were
[15450.36s -> 15456.86s]  released for the Sega Saturn. I don't think more than 20 to 30 games released for that console,
[15458.10s -> 15467.59s]  right? Like 30? That's at least like 200 games for the Xbox One. All right. I think that's good.
[15468.74s -> 15476.74s]  Now down here, what is the worst console that I've ever played? I've never played the Ouya,
[15476.74s -> 15480.82s]  but I mean, like, come on. Whatever. I'll just, I'll just pretend it's down there. What's the worst?
[15483.06s -> 15505.67s]  It's the N-Gage. The N, it's the N-Gage. Like, what, it, it had no purpose. But the Wii U is
[15505.67s -> 15510.60s]  worse than the Virtual Boy? No, the Wii U at least didn't give you a headache. You got actual physical
[15510.60s -> 15518.04s]  damage done to your brain when you used this for more than an hour or two. This didn't damage
[15518.04s -> 15527.96s]  your brain. This one did. Move the switch to S. I've, I was fighting with that for a long time.
[15527.96s -> 15537.85s]  I like this. I like this already. No, don't, I don't, I'm questioning now. There you go.
[15539.70s -> 15562.26s]  There is your list. The, do a German tier list list. Which of my tier lists is the best?
[15563.46s -> 15572.68s]  You're going down too many layers there. You sure the PS1 is better? Better is not enough is the
[15572.68s -> 15583.19s]  right word. But PS1 was just a lot of influential stuff. A ton of great games, a ton of, like,
[15583.19s -> 15589.32s]  their series got their start on it. Super Nintendo, it can't beat it. It's the best console ever made.
[15593.59s -> 15606.38s]  It's just, you just like cheese. All right, guys. I think that's going to be it. I'm sorry
[15606.38s -> 15617.13s]  we had so many problems today, but it was really bad today. And it wasn't even bad in a sense of
[15619.38s -> 15623.94s]  we, it wasn't even dropping frames. It was just dropping everything. The whole thing would just
[15623.94s -> 15632.66s]  turn off. That sucks. So sorry about that. It's like, I think that's like four or five mods.
[15637.19s -> 15642.15s]  Not much I can do. I knew they were doing maintenance. They were doing something. They
[15642.15s -> 15650.78s]  were up, they were upgrading the node or something. They were doing something. So who knows? Maybe they
[15650.78s -> 15656.06s]  either fucked something up or maybe it's one of those scenarios where they're still working on it
[15656.06s -> 15661.18s]  because it was, the internet here was turned off for like eight hours or so. Six hours or so I think
[15661.98s -> 15674.34s]  yesterday, last night going into today. So I don't know. Why is the switch so high? Because
[15674.34s -> 15682.06s]  for the longest time, and I'm talking more than 15 to 20 years, I have been searching and hoping
[15683.02s -> 15688.87s]  for an entertainment device to take into the bathroom with me for my 40 minute shit.
[15689.67s -> 15697.74s]  I used to bring my computer into the bathroom and plug it in and like set up a desk in the bathroom
[15697.74s -> 15713.90s]  and sit there. I used to, it was bad. I used to sit, I used to bring my computer into the bathroom,
[15715.42s -> 15722.92s]  set it up on like a stand up pop up table, and then plug everything in and sit on the toilet
[15723.56s -> 15729.40s]  for a long, long fucking time. And even after I was done, I didn't, because like what a pain
[15729.40s -> 15737.16s]  in the ass that was to get it all in there. So my legs, my legs would start to tingle.
[15738.42s -> 15743.30s]  I would sit there for an extra like 25 minutes and I would have to like, I would be getting like
[15743.30s -> 15750.90s]  tingly legs because I was sitting there for too long. And that's what maybe had to get up.
[15751.46s -> 15767.06s]  I think I remember my mother at the time fighting this and eventually just being like,
[15769.78s -> 15776.01s]  whatever. Like you do, you, if you're gonna do it, if you're gonna do that, then go for it.
[15776.82s -> 15781.93s]  I think at first she's just like, what, what do you bring? Why are you doing all that? Why are
[15781.93s -> 15786.97s]  you bringing all that stuff into the bathroom? It's like, uh, because I wanted, I just, I'm like
[15786.97s -> 15791.45s]  working. I don't know, I was an idiot. No, no, no, I'm going to turn off. I'm going to turn off.
[15791.45s -> 15795.74s]  Listen to me before I go, before I turn off, I want to do the bits, but it's going to be
[15795.74s -> 15800.86s]  fucked up. Hold on. All right. Long story short, I can bring the switch into the bathroom and I can
[15800.86s -> 15807.34s]  shit on it and keep, and keep my hands close and not have to worry about my legs tingling.
[15807.34s -> 15811.90s]  So I can get up whenever I want and put it over. Okay. Done. My internet is going to turn off.
[15811.90s -> 15824.33s]  So let's try to get some of these bits done before we get shut off. Done. Let's get the, no, not BRB.
[15825.05s -> 15830.46s]  I will see you guys later. The next time you're going to see me, I've got some work to do
[15831.26s -> 15843.50s]  on a certain stream. So you will see me after this weekend. I'll be back on what day is it?
[15843.50s -> 15859.37s]  I will be back on Sunday. So it is right now it is Thursday. I'll be back on Sunday. There's a couple
[15859.37s -> 15866.47s]  of things I want to try to get started. I want to try to do a few things on, I want to try to set up
[15866.47s -> 15871.59s]  the Where's Waldo stream. So I'm going to work on that and see if we can get like a good announcement
[15871.59s -> 15876.95s]  I can make next week to set that all up. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you'll know
[15876.95s -> 15884.07s]  very soon. I also am obviously going to work on the other stream too. So I will see you guys on
[15884.07s -> 15890.60s]  Sunday. Sunday, Sunday, Sunday. But for now, let me see, let me try to get through these bits before
[15890.60s -> 15896.38s]  the internet turns off. And if it does, I'm sorry if I miss your bits or your subs. It's kind of out
[15896.38s -> 15902.70s]  of my control at this point, but I'm going to try. We're going to rapid fire these, which usually
[15902.70s -> 15908.95s]  means I'm going to do it much slower than normal. And some of these may have been broken up. I hope
[15908.95s -> 15918.49s]  not. Let me actually get this open. But thank you for joining me. It was a lot of fun. That
[15919.93s -> 15926.44s]  kind of a long one. Playing with Star was a lot of fun. It's fun teaching him how to clean a house.
[15927.48s -> 15942.22s]  We'll raid Vinnie. I'll raid Vinnie after this. That sounds about right. All right, so let's go
[15942.22s -> 15948.66s]  down earlier to today when it's just, I want to see where this cuts off because I, the stream
[15948.66s -> 15957.91s]  turned on and turned off like five times. Let me make sure this is correct. I think it is. And
[15957.91s -> 15963.11s]  earlier, I think because the stream turned off, I missed a couple of big donations and I want to
[15963.11s -> 15969.19s]  make sure I touch upon them. So at some point when the stream was having problems, Lady Wild
[15969.19s -> 15975.96s]  Moonchild gave $50. Vinnie is going to end in 30 minutes. Okay. Well, it's late.
[15976.84s -> 15985.11s]  That's okay. We can, we can hold the raids off then. And let's wait, is Joel streaming?
[15990.95s -> 16003.29s]  Raid Joel. All right, we'll raid Joel after this. Well, let's see who's streaming. It's late. Let
[16003.29s -> 16011.43s]  me get through this. Let me, let me get through the bits. And I don't really want to speed through
[16011.43s -> 16018.79s]  these because that's kind of rude. I hate doing that because right now I'm like kind of up against
[16018.79s -> 16029.16s]  the wire here with the internet. But thank you Lady Wild Moonchild for $50. I finally got a job
[16029.16s -> 16033.56s]  after recovering from a chronic illness. Your streams always cheered me up in a darker moment.
[16034.12s -> 16038.36s]  So I wanted to share some of my first paycheck with you for seeing me through hard times.
[16038.36s -> 16041.96s]  Thank you Jerma for the great content and for facilitating such an amazing community.
[16045.30s -> 16048.66s]  Well, I'm really, really, really glad to hear that you're recovering from
[16048.66s -> 16057.00s]  whatever it is. Thank you for the huge $50 drop. It's a lot of money for anybody to give anybody.
[16058.34s -> 16060.90s]  So thank you for that. And thank you for being part of this community
[16061.94s -> 16069.42s]  because without engaged, engaging people like yourself, it's, it would be kind of boring,
[16070.58s -> 16075.62s]  you know? So having a bunch of really, really fun, interesting people around is good. Very good.
[16076.50s -> 16088.65s]  Thank you for the $50. We also had $10 from Fahita Meat. Thank you Fahita Meat for the 10 bucks.
[16089.45s -> 16094.18s]  Look on the bright side, Jerma. You being short means you are the last one to get hit when it
[16094.18s -> 16100.18s]  rains. You still get hit at the same time. When it starts to rain, everybody gets hit at the same
[16100.18s -> 16110.14s]  time. It's an extra 0.0023 milliseconds. It's not a big deal. Thank you for $3 to Valentura.
[16110.86s -> 16120.07s]  And there's a big boop. Ha ha. Big boop. Thank you for the $3. Thank you Freudian Weapon for
[16120.07s -> 16126.47s]  the $5.56. They just say hello. Hello. Oh, they're from the soundboard. Right. Hello.
[16127.91s -> 16137.96s]  Thank you for the $5.56. We also had $5 from Infectious Frostbite. They say silent viewer
[16137.96s -> 16149.64s]  here. Love the streams. Keep it up. Will do. Thank you so much for the $5. I'm going to keep going.
[16149.64s -> 16159.30s]  Keep streaming. Thank you to AzzyDreamer for the $3. Hey Jerma, long time fan, second time
[16159.30s -> 16163.94s]  donator. Funny enough, I've actually followed your Twitch channel ever since you beat Deltarune on
[16163.94s -> 16170.89s]  stream. This is- and beating Jevil first try. I forgot to put that part in. This is just the
[16170.89s -> 16175.53s]  first time I had both the free time and money to contribute to a live stream. Don't worry,
[16175.53s -> 16180.73s]  I'll still be here regardless of whether or not you play Deltarune again. Oh, here we go.
[16180.73s -> 16185.05s]  P.S. Your battle with Jevil still gives me chills to this day. What a god of a gamer. Seriously.
[16187.90s -> 16190.87s]  Thank you. Sometimes I turn it off.
[16193.77s -> 16202.74s]  Jerma's stretch. Oh god. But thank you AzzyDreamer. And I really appreciate it. Thanks for the three
[16202.74s -> 16211.14s]  bucks. Uh, Devakitty thanks for the $2.50. Hey Jerma, tell the star his apartment is a jungle
[16211.14s -> 16216.02s]  story. Also, holy shit, cereal is a fucking excuse to sell kids candy for breakfast.
[16218.33s -> 16223.77s]  I don't- I don't- I remember. I think his heater was broken and it was just pumping hot air
[16224.73s -> 16231.08s]  into his apartment forever. And it was- you couldn't even be in it. It was like 85 degrees
[16231.08s -> 16239.27s]  in his room. It was something like that. Is that- that might not even be accurate. I know
[16239.27s -> 16256.63s]  it's something like that. Something was like wrong with his heater. 200. It was a fun stream,
[16256.63s -> 16271.14s]  Jerma. But I genuinely hope your- holy shit. Uh, thank you, the funky chicken for the $5.
[16272.73s -> 16276.73s]  Hey Jerma, I made this uh faux movie trailer using green screen and other stuff. Be cool
[16276.73s -> 16285.54s]  if you showed it. I think what I'm probably gonna do, because there still are green screens that
[16285.54s -> 16297.27s]  trickle in and little videos that trickle in. I think it's time. It's time to set aside
[16297.27s -> 16302.86s]  stream time for these. Instead-
