[21.62s -> 35.06s]  Wait, hello there. How are you? Happy Father's Day to all the fathers.
[35.06s -> 46.52s]  Let's just get that right out of the way. Happy Father's Day. Happy Father's Day.
[48.63s -> 59.75s]  Well, I'm a dog, Dad. Oh, thank you. Hope you're doing good. Welcome.
[61.56s -> 65.56s]  Said today or tomorrow we were going to stream and well, I was going to stream.
[69.66s -> 73.10s]  It was going to be either Sunday or Monday and it turned out to be Sunday.
[77.18s -> 79.82s]  We are going to play for a few hours. I'm just going to probably play for,
[80.30s -> 89.00s]  we'll see. We'll see. This game is called only up. The game is impossible.
[90.82s -> 94.10s]  I don't, there's not, there hasn't been one person that's played this game that's gotten past the
[94.10s -> 99.30s]  halfway point. At least that's what I had a dream about. So I just figured it was true.
[104.33s -> 113.75s]  Did Lud beat it? Did Ludwig beat it? Well, yeah, but he's a gamer. Ludwig is a gamer.
[114.57s -> 124.12s]  Lud crushed it. Squeaks beat it too. Well, who didn't beat it? What streamer didn't beat it
[124.12s -> 130.49s]  and rage quit it in an hour. It's like, what category can I be in? Like who rage quitted
[130.49s -> 140.73s]  in like an hour and a half? You. Am I going to be the only one? It's just going to be me.
[141.37s -> 147.56s]  Well, whatever. I beat Jump King, the base game. So that's fine.
[155.00s -> 164.41s]  XQC alt F board. I'll probably do that too. Honestly, I bet that happens here too.
[165.05s -> 169.06s]  Although I don't think I'll alt F4. I will just stop moving
[169.06s -> 171.54s]  and complain about the game for like 25 minutes in the end stream.
[175.50s -> 185.10s]  You have to restart entirely if you close the game. Wait, does it? Well, don't spoil it for me.
[185.10s -> 192.46s]  I don't, I don't, I haven't seen anything. We're going to do face cam today. Yeah,
[192.46s -> 197.43s]  sure. If you're good, I'll make my assessment if you're good or not.
[197.99s -> 207.50s]  And if you're good, I'll turn it on for exactly 15 minutes. Why is this moving?
[208.14s -> 211.42s]  Hold on. This is something's not right here. Hold on. This shouldn't be moving.
[212.22s -> 238.49s]  Can't hear me, but I'll explain in a minute. Over here. Heck. What the heck?
[245.61s -> 251.05s]  I tried to plug a controller in. This game does not support controllers and I got immediately sad.
[251.77s -> 255.61s]  I was like, oh shit, I have to do keyboard and mouse. This is going to end very poorly.
[257.93s -> 262.65s]  So the thing that my chair sits on is it's on to make it so I don't ruin the carpet in the room.
[264.26s -> 269.30s]  It's sitting on top of this like wooden thing and the wooden thing was touching the desk and
[269.30s -> 277.80s]  the desk is touching the mic. So the mic was shaking. Are you guys ready? Let's go.
[280.49s -> 288.70s]  This is only up. We're going to start with no face cam. No face cam begin. There's one thing
[288.70s -> 300.14s]  that I want to talk about very quickly. Grotto beasts. The starter kit for grotto beasts has
[300.14s -> 307.93s]  fallen under 10% availability. We are under 10% stock remaining on the kits. The packs,
[308.49s -> 316.60s]  there are a lot of them. There's a lot of them. But the packs we did a reprint on,
[316.60s -> 325.10s]  the starter kit is not getting a reprint. Kit is not getting a reprint. If you care,
[325.10s -> 330.58s]  you care. If you don't, then let's play only up. But I did say that I was going to tell people
[330.58s -> 339.91s]  that when it became a thing. I want to make sure people knew that. Also important, the kits,
[341.11s -> 347.06s]  the packs that are in the kits have print one boosters in them. They always will be print one
[347.06s -> 360.39s]  because we're not doing a second print. When he said, no, I'm good. Okay. I did, I said I was
[360.39s -> 366.78s]  going to, when we got under 10% of the remaining stock, I said I was going to bring it up and I'll
[366.78s -> 370.78s]  probably bring it up again when we go kind of under 5% because I know people were waiting.
[370.78s -> 374.95s]  It's not a, it's not an inexpensive item. I know some people were saving up and they were like,
[374.95s -> 378.63s]  Hey, can I, is this still going to be available in a few months? And I was like, let's find out.
[378.63s -> 384.46s]  Turn the face cam on. You'll get it if you're, and that's not being good.
[384.46s -> 389.99s]  You're already proving that you're not being good today. Okay. I guess there will be no face cam
[389.99s -> 399.54s]  then. All right. This game's probably going to be pretty easy. Oh, don't look up. We need to get to
[399.54s -> 405.54s]  the top, the top of that. Sure. We'll make it. I wonder what awaits us there. The unknown is
[405.54s -> 415.18s]  frightening. All right. This is going to be a scenario where you wait 15 minutes, like Far Cry
[415.18s -> 432.23s]  four. There's an elevator that like spawns. Just watch. All right. Only go up. Do I need to know
[432.23s -> 443.91s]  anything? Elevator. What? Actual elevator, actual elevator. What? This is, I did not pre-play this.
[443.91s -> 454.39s]  I swear to God, I promise you I didn't. What? Is this actually in the game? How do I use it?
[454.39s -> 467.37s]  I did not pre-play this. I promise you. How do I activate it? Go up, go up. I don't think that's
[467.37s -> 490.58s]  going to work. Should I start here? How do you go up? How do you play the game? Oh, okay. Slow
[490.58s -> 499.32s]  walking, slow motion is hold right mouse, sprint is shift, jump is space, crouch, camera, first person.
[499.32s -> 513.58s]  Okay. Well, how do I play? Can I hold that forever? Secret elevator bug fix. I've already managed to
[513.58s -> 518.74s]  use the secret elevator and get to the very top. What? Why did I not play this three days ago?
[518.74s -> 532.65s]  I could have just ended stream in 10 minutes. All right. I see I can go up here. Like only up,
[532.65s -> 548.57s]  right? Is there a starting point? Where do we go? Press one. All right. When they do the streamer
[548.65s -> 555.43s]  breakdown of how high every streamer got off the ground, I'm going to be at like four meters. This
[555.43s -> 571.06s]  is not good already. All right. I got it. What are you playing? What the fuck is a meter?
[576.57s -> 585.38s]  Must be American. You're finally playing Tears of the Kingdom. What you forgot to say was,
[586.31s -> 596.20s]  you could be playing Tears of the Kingdom instead of this, right? Whatever. Dude, you could be playing
[596.20s -> 605.61s]  Tears of the Kingdom. I also could eat a BLT on stream. That promise is fucking gone. All right,
[605.61s -> 616.71s]  let's just go. Do you automatically grab onto edges? What the fuck is going on?
[623.85s -> 644.70s]  What? Why is it? Is this a distraction? They play distractions. All right, dude,
[644.70s -> 657.86s]  they play distractions at you. There we go. I'm already almost halfway through the game.
[657.86s -> 672.17s]  I'm doing good. Stop. Does everybody else game do this? I mean, hurry up.
[672.81s -> 686.42s]  You can always repeat your mistakes and learn from my mistakes. This is fucking me up so bad.
[686.42s -> 697.67s]  How do I get up? Turn. I got to turn. I'm turning the music off because this is,
[704.95s -> 722.44s]  why can't I still hear it? We'll just go away if I get high enough.
[722.44s -> 733.29s]  Can we get away from the person practicing the song? I mean, if you're practicing songs,
[733.29s -> 743.10s]  wait, what's this thing? Check that out. Yeah. Just keep going. Keep going.
[747.98s -> 753.77s]  Why is it repeating every sound? Just turn it off and put on your own music. I just turned it
[753.77s -> 765.45s]  all the way down and it didn't work. Just restart. I don't want to, I don't do this all over again.
[765.45s -> 781.62s]  Fucking whatever. Like what the fuck? All joke number one. No, I'm trying to reset the game so
[781.62s -> 804.20s]  I don't get the... Okay, turn it back up now. That was easy to get to that point.
[804.20s -> 811.90s]  Is he going to have a meltdown? No, I just, I don't want to get too far in the game and have
[812.62s -> 821.21s]  it actually be, I can't turn that off. Where the hell did I even start from?
[821.21s -> 832.94s]  You got one guide? Did I? Was that one guy? What do you mean yes? That shit happens to everybody?
[835.78s -> 843.94s]  Is that actually part of the game? What? No, you guys are full of shit. There's no way that's part
[843.94s -> 863.11s]  of the game. It's definitely a bug. See, it would have started by now. I think I'm in the clear.
[863.11s -> 892.78s]  It started right here. I don't hear anything. It hasn't repeated. Oh god damn it. Why?
[892.86s -> 921.96s]  Why? Is that seriously part of the game? It can't be. I don't make mistakes. Okay,
[921.96s -> 929.85s]  there's a lot of god rays in this game. The worst possible time to climb a gigantic structure with
[929.85s -> 941.30s]  no harness is absolutely when the god rays are in your fucking face, dude.
[941.30s -> 949.18s]  Do you go in one of these pipes? It's very hard to make a choice when you don't know where it will
[951.00s -> 969.94s]  lead. That's so high. I'm gonna go, all right, I'm gonna go left. This is, okay, I cannot look
[969.94s -> 980.31s]  over a chat. I can't look over a chat. If I look over a chat, I'll fall down. I'm gonna go very
[980.31s -> 993.50s]  slow. I'm gonna take it very calmly. What the fuck did I do that for? I'm fine. I was supposed to
[993.50s -> 1005.61s]  go this way anyways. They definitely wanted you to go middle. Wait, I can walk. I forgot about
[1005.61s -> 1028.39s]  walking. All right, where am I? Geez. Okay, get some sunglasses. What the fuck? I can't see
[1028.39s -> 1052.36s]  anything. I'm gonna go up here. God is calling you. All right, I'm going that way. Wow. I forgot.
[1052.36s -> 1066.82s]  You don't have to hold it. You just click once. Be very gentle. Okay. Oh my god. I forgot to run.
[1066.82s -> 1083.45s]  He's doing the same walk that you did in the Christmas stream. Now, you're referring to the
[1083.45s -> 1099.16s]  sounds. They're like fucking dress shoe Andy. Oh, that's so stupid. I'm just gonna look down.
[1099.16s -> 1120.15s]  Stop reading chat. I know. I'm sorry. I'm so bad. I'm doing all right. Where do I go from here?
[1120.15s -> 1139.48s]  I don't have to jump from here, do I? Oh shit. Down here? I mean, how do I get up to that?
[1139.48s -> 1162.20s]  Go up. Yeah. Where's the correct up? Down there. Fuck it. I don't care. Sometimes you gotta take a
[1162.20s -> 1186.79s]  risk. I think it actually put me in a better position. I gotta turn the volume up now.
[1186.79s -> 1195.05s]  Can you guys hear it now? Or if I walk forward, will I just grow? Oh, there we go. Yep.
[1195.05s -> 1213.54s]  No, you have to jump. Okay. Wait, what about here? Um, I think I'm going the right way.
[1213.54s -> 1220.50s]  Look down, but go up. That's the strategy. Yeah. Look, I got myself in a much better position.
[1220.50s -> 1229.78s]  Oh dear. Okay. This is a big deal. Don't even think about it. Just do it. How? I guess I couldn't make
[1229.78s -> 1245.16s]  it. That the perspective was, the perspective was weird. I thought, so what was the point of that?
[1245.16s -> 1255.85s]  Is that just full of shit? Can I not actually go that way? What? Oh, come on. It's all right. I'll
[1255.85s -> 1260.49s]  get back up there in one second. Sometimes it's hard to choose the right path, but don't be afraid.
[1260.49s -> 1271.38s]  You can always repeat. We learn from our mistakes. And he said, God, I hate this game. I'm all right
[1271.38s -> 1279.66s]  right now. I'll get back up there in no time. So there's no checkpoints. So if I beat this game
[1279.66s -> 1284.60s]  with no checkpoints and when they add checkpoints after a bunch of people complain, I get an accolade,
[1284.60s -> 1300.90s]  right? You're never going to beat this. You have to beat it first though. Hey, I beat pre-patch
[1300.90s -> 1326.12s]  Radan. I think I can beat pre-patch only up. Wait, I didn't go this way last time. Maybe I
[1326.12s -> 1344.97s]  just shouldn't even go that way. Can I go up this way? No! Okay, I'm fine. Yeah, I just see somebody
[1344.97s -> 1355.40s]  bobbing their head with a guitar pick. Just nodding around. You know what I mean? All right,
[1355.40s -> 1362.46s]  here we go. Back to, back where we were before. All right, let me get a good, how do I do first
[1362.46s -> 1370.15s]  person? Because that was obviously wrong. So let me figure it out. First person. How do I do it? C?
[1370.79s -> 1384.25s]  Is it binoculars? I can play the game in first person. No, that's a bad idea. That's actually a
[1384.25s -> 1396.41s]  terrible idea. Okay, that top right up there is wrong. Maybe I need to go right. I'm going to try
[1396.41s -> 1407.77s]  going right. We've been good. Can we have the face game for 15 minutes? Yeah, yeah, you've been good.
[1407.77s -> 1423.90s]  Yeah, you've been good. You get it. Okay, when are you going to do the Peewee Herman dance?
[1424.92s -> 1435.38s]  When there's an opportunity to do a Peewee Herman dance and that's not right now.
[1435.38s -> 1480.25s]  All right, straight ahead. How the fuck do you do this? I'm just gonna go this way. Uh, smart.
[1480.25s -> 1506.52s]  Smart. All right, walk. Do not run. Dude, this game is so bad. People just want to like freak out
[1506.52s -> 1514.04s]  and move their mouse around. You know what I mean? Sometimes I just want to just move my mouse fast.
[1514.04s -> 1518.70s]  It's just like, this is bad for me. You know what I mean? It's how many of you guys just kind of sit
[1518.70s -> 1528.04s]  there and just go like move your mouse just wildly for half a second sometimes. I probably
[1528.04s -> 1534.71s]  should turn the sensitivity down too. You said you'd do the dance next time you were on cam with
[1534.71s -> 1545.51s]  any music playing. I can't do the tequila Peewee Herman dance to that guitar riff.
[1547.53s -> 1558.22s]  Why am I not turning the right way? You see, that was weird. I didn't like that. All right,
[1558.22s -> 1571.50s]  so look, what the hell? Let me get a better look. So this is too far. What about down a little? No,
[1571.50s -> 1582.01s]  I can't, I cannot go this way. Can I jump up and grab the edge here? Wait, can I jump up and grab
[1582.01s -> 1611.46s]  the edge? Dude, all right. I, you gotta use logic. That doesn't do anything for me. Wait, I need to
[1611.46s -> 1622.98s]  get on that one there. Whoa, that was way too far, way too far. Well, all right, I'll do it.
[1622.98s -> 1635.06s]  No, I'm just kidding. How does, how, I didn't know how far the jump went. I just did a full sprint
[1635.06s -> 1639.78s]  jump. I didn't, I can't, I'm not doing it. This is not, this is not Peewee Herman music.
[1640.34s -> 1644.42s]  This is not Peewee Herman dance music. This is not Peewee Herman dance music. I'm not doing it.
[1645.90s -> 1651.08s]  Shit. All right. Well, I had, that's what I, it's just one. Sometimes it's hard to choose the right
[1651.08s -> 1665.85s]  path, but don't be afraid. God damn it. No, go on the elevator. The elevator doesn't work. Do the
[1665.85s -> 1675.37s]  lion pose at least. No, is this, what is this 2017? What do you mean do the lion pose? Is this like
[1675.37s -> 1693.75s]  2018? Do the lion pose. All right. I'm going to get up there really quick. I get it now. So I wonder
[1693.75s -> 1698.63s]  if it's a full regular run jump and not a sprint jump. I just, I don't know. I don't know what the
[1698.63s -> 1702.95s]  trajectory, I don't know what the, the physics are. I don't know how far you go with a full jump. I
[1702.95s -> 1706.23s]  don't know how short you go with a small jump. This is all things I have to figure out over the
[1706.23s -> 1725.70s]  next 20 minutes before I all F4 and take like three months off. What the fuck just happened?
[1726.26s -> 1741.00s]  Okay. My boogers almost just flew out of my nose because people want me to do the Peewee Herman
[1741.00s -> 1750.79s]  dance. It's hard to choose the right path. Don't be afraid. You can always repeat. We learn from
[1750.87s -> 1759.75s]  our mistakes. All right. I got to get to where I just was. Good luck. Okay. How do I get over there?
[1768.76s -> 1782.62s]  That works too. Jerma's Peewee Herman promise. No, this is not the way you think. This is not,
[1782.62s -> 1799.26s]  this is the wrong, this is the wrong tune. Okay. This is the wrong tune. All right. I'm here. I'm
[1799.26s -> 1805.74s]  actually here. I actually made it. I made it. Look. All right. Burn this into long-term memory.
[1805.74s -> 1815.38s]  Where did I go? That was right up the middle. That was right up the middle and I don't remember.
[1815.38s -> 1821.62s]  Just don't lose. It's okay. I just don't fall off. I don't win. Is there a crouch or anything?
[1821.62s -> 1834.90s]  Because this is freaking me out. Oh God. Wait. Is this bait? I don't know what this does.
[1834.90s -> 1851.46s]  That's bait. That doesn't mean it. Wait. Is this a checkpoint? Does this do anything?
[1851.46s -> 1865.48s]  I think it's just a place to just sit for a minute and take a drink of water. Oh, that was
[1866.84s -> 1887.74s]  good. What was that? Experience. You know how fast I can move. Here I am. One second. Next
[1887.74s -> 1893.43s]  second. I'm gone. What? I don't know. I'm just, I'm coping because I think I'm going to fall.
[1893.43s -> 1920.62s]  Okay. So in games like this, sometimes you just have to go. Oh, this is bait too,
[1920.62s -> 1931.72s]  because I'm going to grab this and fall off. It's going to squish my fingers. That camera
[1931.72s -> 1955.42s]  is not fun. Okay. Now once I get up to this pipe, I'm going to just take a second.
[1955.42s -> 1961.34s]  There is something strange going on in this world, though there has always been something wrong.
[1961.34s -> 1966.68s]  Would everyone come to the stability has been shaken. Maybe this is a chance for me.
[1967.40s -> 1980.04s]  Oh dude, there better be an arcade up there. That's what I would do. I would put like classic
[1980.04s -> 1984.46s]  games up there and they're free. You don't have to, you know what I mean? Just get, once you get up,
[1984.46s -> 1989.74s]  what do you mean minus two? What I'm saying? Like that's a milestone. You get there and it's like,
[1989.74s -> 1997.42s]  I can, I can play like a bunch of arcade games. Now I can play like minus two silence. All of you.
[1997.42s -> 2003.77s]  That's why I wasn't making a joke. I was making a statement. I wasn't, that was a statement. That
[2003.77s -> 2015.03s]  was not a joke. I'm not touching that bed till I know where I'm going. What do you mean? What do
[2015.19s -> 2022.22s]  I, I said, it'd be cool if there was an arcade up there. That was a statement. All right. You,
[2022.22s -> 2025.18s]  I know what you're doing. You're fucking with me. Cause this is like the part where every streamer
[2025.18s -> 2040.98s]  falls down and everybody goes, the steam come out of this shit. Do I get blasted with steam?
[2048.18s -> 2066.09s]  Oh, okay. Okay. I feel safe up here. I made it. Look how I got to test his theory
[2068.78s -> 2090.36s]  and then fucking jump off. See who hits the ground first. Do a victory dance. Not yet. Can you grab
[2090.36s -> 2108.10s]  and like kind of shimmy on the thing? How are they floating? It's a video game. There's not even that
[2108.10s -> 2116.82s]  much left in the game. It's not like that goes up for like another four hours of gameplay.
[2116.82s -> 2121.58s]  All right. It looks like, hold on. Let me get a good view. Can I change the day night cycle?
[2121.58s -> 2142.60s]  Can it be like noon instead of 5 PM permanently? Risk. Okay. Risk off. Risk on. If you want to go
[2142.60s -> 2166.23s]  quickly, go with friends. If you want to go far, go alone. Oh, what do I do? Oh shit. I'm going to
[2166.23s -> 2174.76s]  land on it. It's fine. Okay. Can I, can I move it faster? Do I have to like sprint to move it or
[2174.76s -> 2183.80s]  something? How do I change it? How do I change? Okay. I'm fine. Here you have a great view of
[2183.80s -> 2188.92s]  the favelas. Oh no. This is where everyone lives in poverty, which is hard to get out. Okay. Okay.
[2188.92s -> 2191.88s]  Okay. How do I, how do I, how do I, how do I, should I get off? The whole life and the lives
[2191.88s -> 2198.87s]  of my goddamn parents have been. God damn parents. I think this is all bait to scare you.
[2198.87s -> 2216.97s]  I think I'm good. I want to look up to see. I think this ends. I don't know what to do. Should
[2216.97s -> 2226.28s]  I just keep riding it? What does this take me? In a game where you can fall and lose an hour of
[2226.28s -> 2232.82s]  progress? I'm freaking out right now. I'm just going to ride it. This is all bait to have you
[2232.82s -> 2260.36s]  freak out and jump off. It's all bait. I made it. Okay. Can you fail that? Or did I somehow
[2260.36s -> 2262.52s]  accidentally do everything correct? I don't know what I did.
[2275.62s -> 2280.26s]  You have to be with them and not stand out. You won't make it. You're a weak kid.
[2280.98s -> 2287.06s]  Go back to the favelas. Your friends are there. Your destiny and life is there. R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.
[2287.06s -> 2297.48s]  Happiness there. Get a job in the favelas and live there. Okay. So obviously that way.
[2298.04s -> 2304.31s]  Put some music on. No, if I put music on, then I have to do the Pee-wee Herman dance. I know
[2304.31s -> 2325.98s]  what you're doing. That's a Gotham scenario. That's a Gotham scenario. Okay. Let me just
[2325.98s -> 2334.54s]  assess this. I'm not doing too bad. Hold on. This is an Omega jump, right? I hope so.
[2341.08s -> 2368.18s]  Holy shit. Why did I just fall? Oh my God. To get to the new one, you first have to make a jump
[2368.18s -> 2375.43s]  and get off the ground, not knowing what the future holds. I thought I missed that. I was
[2375.43s -> 2388.09s]  going to say, how is that possible? Okay. Just have confidence. The only thing that matters in
[2388.09s -> 2395.16s]  this game is confidence. Even if you fail, if you go, you're going to fucking miss.
[2396.20s -> 2401.54s]  There's a jump coming up. Jump. Go. Now. You've seen me do it a few times and it's worked out,
[2401.54s -> 2422.92s]  but sometimes it doesn't. What do you mean wait? That was the worst sound you ever made?
[2424.44s -> 2429.50s]  No, it is not. You've got like 13 years of audio clips of me talking. That's not possible.
[2430.84s -> 2435.56s]  There's like a three or 4,000 sound library of all the fucked up dumb sounds I've made.
[2435.56s -> 2440.22s]  That is not one of them. That's not even on the tier list. That wouldn't even get an image.
[2440.78s -> 2447.99s]  Like a PNG at the bottom of the tier list. Sorry. You're just wildly inaccurate.
[2447.99s -> 2463.86s]  I wonder if that was a bad idea. No. All right. Where am I going? We don't think. We just go.
[2468.76s -> 2476.65s]  I thought I was slipping. I thought I was slipping off. What the fuck? Sometimes it doesn't catch.
[2484.04s -> 2498.47s]  Okay. I got to go slower here because these things are weird. Can I climb this pole?
[2499.72s -> 2505.82s]  No way. No, we'll go on the shore thing. We'll go on the shore thing.
[2508.74s -> 2521.83s]  I'm not messing around right now. Are those balloons up there? Okay. I want to get to at
[2521.83s -> 2535.40s]  least the balloon part. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Why did it do that?
[2536.28s -> 2555.66s]  Why did it do that? He just went and then just fell. What the fuck was that? That was...
[2556.22s -> 2561.66s]  You showed me what was wrong with that jump. He just like scrunched up and put his head into his
[2561.66s -> 2572.95s]  neck and then... You've got to be fucking kidding me. What? I didn't make a mistake.
[2573.83s -> 2582.60s]  What mistake did I make? That was clean. That was... And I told you. I knew that was... It was weird.
[2582.60s -> 2592.07s]  The collision on those trains is like fucked up. I got there once. I can get there. But that wasn't
[2592.07s -> 2600.71s]  even that hard to get there. It's just pain in the ass. It's a slow-mo feature. Yeah, but I
[2600.71s -> 2610.95s]  forget about the slow motion. I literally just jumped onto the train and it did that.
[2611.51s -> 2622.02s]  You jumped on the... Give me... All right. What was the... I forget everything. I forget everything.
[2622.02s -> 2627.46s]  I was too... Where's the... There's a car that I jump on and then I go from the car to the...
[2628.18s -> 2634.90s]  Over here. Where is it? I don't remember. This was an hour ago. There's like a fence and a car.
[2637.32s -> 2655.14s]  Get wrecked, pleb. I didn't even get wrecked. I did a good job. Where is the part...
[2655.86s -> 2674.86s]  Get... Turn this fucking sun off. Turn the sun off. Go in the elevator? Did I actually unlock
[2674.86s -> 2697.94s]  a checkpoint? Are you guys fucking with me or is that real? There are no checkpoints. No.
[2697.94s -> 2709.88s]  Why can I not find the car... Oh, it's over here. That was such dog shit. Hey, you all know.
[2709.88s -> 2718.31s]  Everybody knows it. We all understand it. I don't even feel bad about that. I would feel bad about
[2718.31s -> 2727.37s]  that if I did something wrong, but we did a poll. There's 21,000 people here. 20,850 of you said
[2728.25s -> 2738.09s]  there was a game bug and 50 of you said that I was a stupid gamer. It was overwhelmingly
[2738.98s -> 2753.51s]  positive on my end. You ran a poll? You were one of the 50 people that... That sucks. This is all...
[2753.51s -> 2777.16s]  I'm just trying to not freak out. Stop spreading misinformation. How close is the sun in this
[2777.16s -> 2800.12s]  universe? What the... Stop. All right. It was right up the middle and then I can go quick.
[2800.12s -> 2809.46s]  I can do it quick. That's hot dog shooter in, I don't know, the Northwest. You know what? At
[2809.46s -> 2825.96s]  least for what I know. It's like one of the best videos ever. It was this way, right? Was it a game
[2825.96s -> 2837.13s]  bug? I'm just saying. I know how to get back here. Everything's fine. I don't want to rush
[2837.13s -> 2850.95s]  because there's more... Look, if you rush, you'll end up as an image of whatever the fuck that image
[2850.95s -> 2861.75s]  is. All right. I made it. Don't rush because the time that you lose rushing and falling versus just
[2861.75s -> 2873.59s]  doing it correctly. I just need to get to the balloons that I'm going to alter for. I'm going
[2873.59s -> 2878.25s]  to get to the balloons, do the tequila peewee Herman dance, and turn the stream off. That's
[2878.25s -> 2900.33s]  the goal for today. Show the image. I can't right now. Alt-tabbing and copying and saving and then
[2900.33s -> 2906.81s]  exporting and rendering and then putting it into OBS. And I think OBS put the bitrate at
[2906.81s -> 2910.49s]  certain kilobits to make sure it can be seen and then watch the rendering on the OBS.
[2910.49s -> 2921.43s]  I got to focus on this. Otherwise, I'll fall. And then do the necessary legal paperwork to show it
[2922.81s -> 2927.24s]  and send out all the consent forms to be able to sign and everything for
[2928.04s -> 2958.31s]  showing it on stream. And it's just a lot. Shut up, nerd. You're plus two-ing that guy.
[2961.08s -> 2968.36s]  I crafted a joke. And it was like a fucking fine French cuisine meal.
[2969.22s -> 2982.33s]  A guy calls me a nerd and I lose the comedy war. Just shut up and go. All right. Here we go. I'm
[2982.33s -> 2989.94s]  back to where I was. Pretty much. I have to ride the thing again. Let me just see what this does.
[2989.94s -> 3007.82s]  I'm not going to- doesn't do anything. It moves you forward. All right. We're not doing that.
[3007.82s -> 3031.35s]  Chad chatter versus the virgin Jeremy. Shut up, nerd. What the- what? You- it's not funny when I
[3031.35s -> 3042.31s]  do it? That's not fair. What do you mean that's mean? Somebody just called me a nerd. It's not
[3042.31s -> 3059.51s]  mean? Okay. I will show this one because it's really funny. I'm going to show this one because
[3059.51s -> 3108.98s]  it's good. It's good. I'm just going to- might as well. I don't even look human. I look like
[3108.98s -> 3127.56s]  a different species. All right. Don't distract me. I'm working on something. Do you look like
[3127.56s -> 3135.37s]  the Teletubbies? What about over here? There's something over there. Am I too much of a coward
[3135.37s -> 3146.15s]  to go look? Yeah. I think so. Let's just do what I did before. Once I get off the rollercoaster,
[3146.15s -> 3161.86s]  that's when I'm pretty much back where I was. Teletubby's son? Yeah. Risk on. Risk on. Risk off.
[3161.86s -> 3172.58s]  All right. We're just going to sit here and just hang out. Can I actually fall off this or
[3172.58s -> 3185.30s]  my good just to hang out and look at chat and stuff? Is that okay? Am I going to get like
[3185.30s -> 3203.94s]  just jump right now? No, don't think so. No, that's good. Oh, I have to choose the directions. I
[3203.94s -> 3215.06s]  didn't do that last time. I definitely was not doing that last time. I just look at it. I wonder
[3215.06s -> 3231.29s]  if people are lying to me. It's probably true. I'm good. I'm good. That was a dangerous thing, kid.
[3231.29s -> 3253.46s]  Don't do that again. Why is it so quiet? The volume's even turned up too. Why is the volume
[3253.46s -> 3261.88s]  so low? Did you see the live action One Piece trailer? They go, yeah, yo, yeah, yo. Do they?
[3261.88s -> 3274.15s]  Really? Do they actually do that? No, they don't. They do not do that. I wouldn't bet any money,
[3274.15s -> 3292.74s]  but I would friendly bet you that they do not do that. No, I'm busy. This is where I was before,
[3292.74s -> 3301.42s]  and this is where it all became a disaster. Slow down. The game, this part of the game is
[3301.42s -> 3323.50s]  fucked, okay? Risk on. Risk off. There's a little bit of momentum when you land.
[3323.50s -> 3342.74s]  Okay, slow it down. Where did I get caught up? It was right here, right? We're good. No, wait,
[3342.74s -> 3352.78s]  it was after this. It was after this. It's up here. Up there. Oh, up there. I'm almost there.
[3352.78s -> 3362.57s]  All right. Yeah, yo, yeah, yo. Give it up. Give it up. Give it up. Give it up. I don't even need
[3362.57s -> 3368.78s]  to be up here, do I? This is kind of a mistake, but I'm kind of terrified to go any other way.
[3368.78s -> 3392.09s]  This is the only way that I know. Risk on. Risk off. All right, this is it over here. I
[3392.09s -> 3424.25s]  got to make this. That is exactly where I lost last time, wasn't it? No, it was up here. All
[3424.25s -> 3440.36s]  back to the beginning, it would be really funny. All right, so pay attention time. What the hell
[3440.36s -> 3471.32s]  even happened here? It was right here. We're good. All right, there's going to be a hole that I can
[3471.32s -> 3474.76s]  fall through, or one of these is going to open. One of these is going to open up. A window is
[3474.76s -> 3508.50s]  going to open. Oh, shit. Is this a full sprint omega jump, or do I walk on that? Risk off. I
[3508.50s -> 3542.60s]  forgot to say it was on. Where are most of the balloons? That's going to be so bad. That's going
[3542.60s -> 3596.81s]  to be so bad. Jesus. All right. Assess. Assess first. No, I have to do this. So I have to go all
[3596.81s -> 3618.79s]  the way over there, and then, well, I could go risk on and go that way. Let me look at it. Do not. Do
[3618.79s -> 3625.26s]  not. Do not. Should I go? I could go risk on and do a full jump right now and just jump on that.
[3625.26s -> 3637.42s]  Risk off. Risk off. Okay. All right. You sure? I think I'm doing it. Risk on. Risk. All right.
[3637.42s -> 3649.48s]  Fine. Risk off. Risk off. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Oh, my God. This thing is really fucked up.
[3651.94s -> 3662.39s]  Okay. But do I want to go all the way over there, or do I just drop here and go that way?
[3662.39s -> 3668.97s]  Now, there's nothing over there. This is the, is this the only way to go? Yep. Oh, that does not
[3668.97s -> 3702.87s]  look good. Drop. Oh, you soft locked yourself? No, it didn't look right there. Oh, this is so
[3702.87s -> 3711.10s]  fucked up. I actually can't even walk this way. What about right there? What about I'm so,
[3712.54s -> 3736.04s]  that's a long way down. I can fix it. Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God. Thank
[3736.04s -> 3746.01s]  God. Thank God. Thank goodness. I'm going to puke. I thought I was going to fall. All right. Risk off.
[3746.01s -> 3752.82s]  I don't know. Why would this even be here? This to me looks like a shortcut. It probably is.
[3752.82s -> 3783.51s]  Risk off. Do you see how weird this thing is? Do you want a secret tip? I'm not looking at
[3783.51s -> 3789.88s]  anything else. The only thing I care about is this kid's hat in the middle of the pipe.
[3789.88s -> 3804.98s]  I'm not looking at anything else. Why would I pay attention to anything else? Uh-uh. Uh-uh. I mean,
[3804.98s -> 3830.60s]  I'm just not going to do this. Do you know what I'm saying? No way. I'll miss it. I'm too far up.
[3830.60s -> 3837.50s]  My God. Just focus on the hat. You fucking idiot. I'm there. I'm right there. You can't
[3838.22s -> 3872.20s]  crack under the pressure right now. You're literally 85% of the way done. Now where?
[3872.20s -> 3884.71s]  Fuck. What's worse? The scary pipe. I know how to do the pipe. Wait, can I just do this?
[3890.90s -> 3896.60s]  I know how to do the pipe. I've done it. I just did it before. I know how it works.
[3897.85s -> 3904.55s]  I'm going for pipe, but I got to do an omega jump from here. Oh, I just do it. Just do it. Risk on.
[3907.30s -> 3932.47s]  Yep. Don't even think about it. Just go. Okay. Give me a second. Captain Crunch is up here
[3932.47s -> 3937.18s]  and he's laughing at me. And he's like, fucking with me. I got to get rid of him.
[3937.18s -> 3942.87s]  Just give me a second. Captain Crunch is making fun of me right now. He's just like,
[3942.87s -> 3946.47s]  oh, my Captain Crunch cereal is more nutritious than this fucking dope.
[3947.59s -> 3952.65s]  He's up there and I got to get rid of him. He's like laughing in the chat. I don't know why. It's
[3952.65s -> 3996.90s]  like the white and blue hat. I just saw the white and blue hat. They're playing quop. Just do the
[3996.90s -> 4049.46s]  fucking snail strategy. It works. I'm about to turn the risk on and just fucking run. This is
[4049.46s -> 4067.93s]  a very effective strategy, but it's funny looking and like, hey, hey, hey, why is he turning this way?
[4067.93s -> 4119.78s]  I didn't turn him that way. I didn't turn him that way. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I'm not jumping from here.
[4119.78s -> 4141.58s]  I'm not jumping from here. That would be a huge mistake. Did I just punch the bike?
[4141.58s -> 4156.10s]  Oops. I'm sorry. I was doing the roar. Okay. Now what? I was doing the lion pose from 2018.
[4156.10s -> 4162.01s]  Be careful. Don't go too fast. I'm going to take a second here because I'll be honest with you.
[4162.01s -> 4166.26s]  It's time for me to get a little, uh, just to toot my own horn a little bit.
[4166.26s -> 4170.50s]  A lot of you thought I was going to fail at the pipes like 40 minutes ago,
[4170.50s -> 4179.72s]  and I deserve an apology. I can't wait. I think I deserve, I think I deserve an apology.
[4188.65s -> 4195.83s]  We are not sorry. No, no, no, no. I'll get it eventually. If I get to the top,
[4196.39s -> 4202.33s]  I'm going to see a bunch of sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, my God, dude. I'm so sorry. You're so cool.
[4203.19s -> 4224.78s]  Okay. Obvious. Oh, more pipe shit. Um, yeah, that's the right way. It's very obviously the
[4224.78s -> 4241.08s]  correct way. Oh, I'm so scared to jump and grab this. I feel like I'm not high enough.
[4241.64s -> 4267.67s]  Am I high enough to grab this fucking thing? Oh, my God. I almost dropped. Shit. All right.
[4267.67s -> 4275.74s]  He's high. I actually said to Holly before I turned the stream on. I was like, if I like,
[4275.74s -> 4281.90s]  would I even be able to get past the first jump high if I did this high? She just shook her head.
[4282.70s -> 4300.89s]  She just went, okay, maybe I shouldn't do it. I just want us to remember this moment when I
[4300.89s -> 4304.65s]  got here and we're just like hanging out. You were going to? No, I was just saying like,
[4304.65s -> 4312.10s]  would I even be able to? I'm not talking about like, I'm just talking about in general. Um,
[4312.10s -> 4315.37s]  let's just, can I just savor this? Because I'm probably going to fall in like 10 minutes.
[4315.37s -> 4332.84s]  All right, let's go back to walking. And I feel like I need to jump onto this. And we're just
[4332.84s -> 4337.24s]  going to go straight. And I guess I have to go up that pipe, which is going to be unbearable.
[4337.24s -> 4342.58s]  So don't do anything stupid. I've got plenty of time. It's not like I'm on a time limit.
[4361.34s -> 4365.42s]  I would make a comment on, you know, the world and the environment and shit, but I,
[4365.98s -> 4378.39s]  I'm, this is, I've, I've, I've, you know what I'm saying? I cannot fall off of this. Somebody said,
[4378.39s -> 4390.89s]  okay. I would make, I can't make any comments right now. Turn risk on. Oh,
[4393.91s -> 4398.84s]  am I going to never mind? Am I going to say it? But again, am I going to get it or is it going to
[4398.84s -> 4421.26s]  glitch out? Wait, what? This is not world of warcraft, dude. You can't turn the camera to
[4421.26s -> 4429.02s]  get a better view and then use W to go forward. I almost just did that. My fucking heart.
[4429.02s -> 4444.60s]  Holy shit. I almost just did that. I almost did the world of warcraft. Get a better angle.
[4444.60s -> 4460.79s]  Only go, only look forward. Don't look back. Don't look down. What's with this camera? Stop it.
[4460.79s -> 4493.08s]  Camera. What are you doing? Stop doing this. What's with this camera right now? Oh my goodness.
[4493.08s -> 4526.46s]  Everybody fails at that part because they don't get it. I do. I wonder if I jump from here or do
[4526.46s -> 4535.11s]  I go from the end and try to catch the side or do I try to catch the perpendicular, you know what
[4535.11s -> 4543.13s]  I mean? Perpendicular shave. You monster. I'm just going to go until it's like all the way down to
[4543.13s -> 4553.02s]  my fucking chest. If I was, if it were me doing this and it is I'm going from here and I'm actually
[4553.02s -> 4576.60s]  terrified right now. The other part of me is saying go to the end and grab onto the edge. Well,
[4576.60s -> 4583.58s]  we just got to risk on. That's what you do. You just turn risk on. Sometimes you just have to do
[4583.58s -> 4611.46s]  it. Just stop thinking about it and just go. Uh oh. Just risk on. What the fuck is going on here?
[4611.46s -> 4636.63s]  This is fucked up. Where? What? Okay. What? Hold on. Let's assess this. Risk on? No, no, not yet.
[4636.63s -> 4653.00s]  Not yet. I don't know if I can, I can't grab onto this. Risk on. I was completely risk off there and
[4653.00s -> 4683.14s]  that was a, that was stupid. Let's fucking go. I, I thought that was the end. Oh dear. No way.
[4700.68s -> 4713.18s]  Okay. My hands are like kind of shaking. Jesus. Where are the balloons? Am I almost, I'm almost
[4713.18s -> 4726.54s]  at the balloons. We're good. I'm literally shaking. I'm going to go. Stopping now is a bad idea.
[4726.54s -> 4731.50s]  I'm just going to go up this pipe because like there's a bunch of shit over there. I could go.
[4731.50s -> 4747.27s]  No, I see, I see where I'm going. I'm going this way. Do it. Do it. Do it. This is a boat. Oh,
[4747.27s -> 4762.55s]  it's like a factory. Take it slow. I, yep. I'm going to take it slow. This is, this is here to fuck
[4762.55s -> 4786.42s]  with you or no, it's not. Is it though? It might be here to fuck with you. This might be a sprint
[4786.42s -> 4797.85s]  jump. No, it's, I don't think so. This is a sprint jump. Holy shit. I thought I was done.
[4808.66s -> 4825.05s]  No, what? Oh, YouTube thumbnail. What the heck? I know, but seriously, like what the fuck? Dude.
[4829.14s -> 4853.08s]  I did it. I made it to the fucking factory. Geez. All right. Settle down. This does not look too bad,
[4853.08s -> 4909.22s]  but who knows, right? There's a shit load left. I'm almost at the balloons, which is where my,
[4910.10s -> 4915.80s]  okay. You know, in Hearthstone battlegrounds, when you, uh, if you get in the top four,
[4915.80s -> 4923.29s]  it's considered a win. That's my top four. That's the, I placed top four in battlegrounds.
[4923.29s -> 4943.82s]  I don't care if I lose. I don't care if I get number one. Okay. Balloons is like the energy
[4944.78s -> 4950.78s]  win thing. This is not even 40%. Stop looking up. What are you talking about? I want to,
[4950.78s -> 4957.22s]  I need to see where the fuck I'm going. Nothing else up here. No, this is the right way.
[4957.22s -> 4963.34s]  I could go that way too, but no, that looks horrible. I almost just fell off right there.
[4963.34s -> 4970.50s]  What a fucking blunder that would have been. Fourth place is third loser. You still get two
[4970.50s -> 4975.46s]  points in Mario Kart. That's two points that number five doesn't get. I'm good. Your nose
[4975.46s -> 4986.76s]  is sweating. Wipe the sweat from your nose. I wipe the sweat from my nose when you wipe the grease
[4986.76s -> 5001.56s]  from your hair. Birth, kindergarten, school, army, institute, factory, death. What? We're bouncing
[5001.56s -> 5018.79s]  back and forth today. I'm, I'm giving it back. Is it really bad? Hold on. Why are you so mean?
[5019.51s -> 5027.70s]  No, I'm just bouncing it back. That works better if your hair doesn't look wicked greasy.
[5027.70s -> 5044.41s]  Your hair is 10 times greasier than mine. It only works if I'm clean. Please. Come on. All
[5044.41s -> 5050.06s]  right. No more messing around. I expelled a lot of that like nervous energy, right? Just like you
[5050.06s -> 5054.46s]  got to get it out because we're, this is about to get fucked up. So I got to pay attention.
[5054.46s -> 5063.61s]  Okay. We're just bouncing it back, dude. We're good. I should, I said shiny, not greasy. All
[5063.61s -> 5068.82s]  right. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. This is way, I'm like halfway through this game that nobody
[5068.82s -> 5072.82s]  thought I was ever going to make it to the piece of American cheese. And I'm sorry, but you were
[5072.82s -> 5101.00s]  wrong and you're seething in chat right now. Jesus. Okay. No, I think it's all right. This is
[5101.00s -> 5105.24s]  all right. I can't fall through the middle. I don't think that would be weird if I could.
[5107.03s -> 5112.60s]  Is this an omega jump though? I, it might be, go. I just scared the shit out of myself to do it.
[5121.05s -> 5143.16s]  What the? Jeremy, not you, me. Stop that nonsense. Balloons.
[5164.79s -> 5188.76s]  I almost just lost to a stupid slow motion joke. Train onto the train maybe. I don't think there's
[5188.76s -> 5203.24s]  anywhere else to go. This might be a bad idea. Let me go. I want to look. Did I miss something?
[5203.24s -> 5227.54s]  I think it on top. This is probably really stupid what I'm doing. No, that's, that's definitely
[5227.54s -> 5238.20s]  right. That's absolutely correct. Happy pride. That's right. It's pride month. Happy pride,
[5238.20s -> 5261.35s]  everybody. Happy pride month. Am I doing this wrong? This, that I glitched through that.
[5261.35s -> 5267.67s]  That felt, that felt fucked up. No, I can't even grab onto that. I'm paranoid to go in there,
[5267.67s -> 5284.04s]  but I'm guessing I'm going to. Oh shit. Okay. Well, I found where I need to go.
[5285.75s -> 5290.22s]  I don't think this is right. I don't think I can make that jump. Even if it's an Omega jump.
[5290.22s -> 5302.98s]  Risk on? Fine. This camera sucks. I'm stuck. That's not, that's not correct. Thank God it
[5302.98s -> 5311.43s]  stopped me. There's no way that's correct. I got, it's, I went, I went, I went into an invisible wall.
[5311.43s -> 5318.23s]  I don't know where to go. I'm paranoid to do anything. I feel like I had the right idea here.
[5318.23s -> 5355.56s]  It's not. Rail to that, to that. Is it about this side? It's right here. How come I didn't grab on
[5355.56s -> 5381.30s]  the last few times? Um, well, even if I miss, it's fine. Why? I thought that was a scary
[5381.30s -> 5395.58s]  horror movie sound. I don't like this. I don't like this Minecraft spawner. Yeah. I am terrified.
[5395.58s -> 5438.41s]  Risk on. Okay. Now what? This way over here off the tractor. All right. It looks like there's a
[5438.41s -> 5449.59s]  couple ways to go. I can go over there to the right and up. Let's get a good look. Yeah. No.
[5449.59s -> 5455.54s]  Okay. This is right. It's really stupid for me to jump from here to there to save what amounts to
[5455.54s -> 5461.75s]  four seconds. My brain is trying to tell me to hurry the fuck up and go over there and do it.
[5461.75s -> 5465.75s]  No. Risk off. You need to know when to turn it on and when to turn it off.
[5467.99s -> 5490.76s]  Should I go to the cheese? What do you think? No. How do you go from, where do you go from the cheese?
[5490.76s -> 5499.96s]  What is on the cheese right now, actually? What is that? I don't see any way up there.
[5499.96s -> 5514.09s]  Is it a bed? So that's harder, but it's essentially a shortcut. I don't know. Uh-uh. I'm way too far.
[5514.65s -> 5550.95s]  No. Risk off. Risk off. Sorry. It's not worth it. It's no. Uh, how do I? I think I have to do it.
[5550.95s -> 5563.27s]  No, I don't. I thought I had to do the cheese. I feel safe moving pretty quickly up here just
[5563.27s -> 5604.63s]  because if I fall, it doesn't matter. I'm going to land right here. Where the hell am I? This is
[5604.63s -> 5612.18s]  not connected to anything. Don't I? It's a strange feeling. I've never been this far away from home.
[5612.18s -> 5638.36s]  Risk on. Oh, yes. My undertaker. Destroy him. I didn't know that happened. It's a good thing
[5638.36s -> 5644.66s]  I fucking jumped. Holy shit. It's a good thing I jumped when I did because I would have just lost.
[5644.66s -> 5657.90s]  Wowee. Wow. That was horrifying. Okay. I've gotten kind of lucky the last couple of big jumps.
[5657.90s -> 5680.06s]  Where am I going from here? I can fall through this shit. This is not going to be fun. Can I
[5680.06s -> 5690.23s]  fall through this? I guess I can't. It looks like I can go right through here, but I'm not falling
[5690.23s -> 5696.86s]  right now. Why am I not falling through this? You cannot. Okay. I hope you're not lying to me. This
[5696.86s -> 5701.86s]  is like an hour and four. This is an hour and 10 minutes of progress. Please don't lie to me.
[5701.86s -> 5742.86s]  Okay. Where is this one going to go? Oh my God. I had to release some gas right there. Okay.
[5742.86s -> 5765.26s]  Everything's fine. Holy shit. I think I'm getting, I might be getting kind of close to being in a
[5765.26s -> 5770.57s]  position where I might be able to finish this video game in like another hour. If I do good,
[5770.57s -> 5777.94s]  just don't make any mistakes. Let me be the first streamer on Twitch to fall like once really and
[5777.94s -> 5782.18s]  beat the game in like three tries. Let's go for it. You know what I'm saying? Let me get like an
[5782.18s -> 5799.02s]  accolade for once in the last like three or four years. That bug just got on me. A bug is on me.
[5799.02s -> 5821.34s]  Spider, it's a huge one. Okay. These don't be stupid. Jesus Christ. Oh no, no, no. My accolade,
[5821.34s -> 5828.86s]  my accolade, my accolade. No, I need my accolade. Oh no. Oh, big mistakes. This is bad.
[5828.86s -> 5848.22s]  My accolade. I was, holy shit. No, I just, I risked on and I wouldn't risk off and I was stuck.
[5848.22s -> 5856.06s]  I couldn't walk forward. The cones, the cones have collision that are a full fucking rectangle
[5856.06s -> 5865.64s]  around them and I thought I was stuck and I freaked out. I couldn't walk. There was two cones and they
[5865.64s -> 5876.09s]  had a gigantic collision in front of them. I thought I was going to slip off. Risk on for the
[5876.09s -> 5883.45s]  rest of the fucking stream. I was doing so good too. It's just like, look at this. I'm back at the
[5883.45s -> 5898.92s]  fucking roller coaster segment. I didn't do it on purpose. I thought I landed on it, but God
[5898.92s -> 5907.02s]  fucking damn it. I thought I screwed it up. When I slipped back that time, I thought I was going to
[5907.02s -> 5912.04s]  keep going. I was like, fuck, I'm going to jump on the bed and just go for it. This was 25 minutes
[5912.04s -> 5916.82s]  into the stream. Don't worry. I'll get back there in 10 minutes. Time it. Watch this. I was going to
[5916.82s -> 5921.96s]  zone out and fucking risk on. I'll get back there in 10 minutes. I'm going to risk on
[5921.96s -> 5929.53s]  big time. You don't even know. You better believe that this is going full risk on right now and I'm
[5929.53s -> 5945.16s]  going to get to the top in 10 minutes. I'm not fucking around. Here we go. Do it to the
[5945.16s -> 5958.79s]  supermarket sweep music. It's a good idea. Supermarket sweep OST. That doesn't come up
[5958.79s -> 6012.54s]  with anything. No, I'm not ready yet. We're not ready yet. Settings, loop. How do I loop it?
[6012.54s -> 6042.12s]  Right click it. Will he reach the crane again by 745? You had better vote yes. What do you think
[6042.12s -> 6435.02s]  about urinal cakes? They smell. Where the fuck am I? Where am I? We're good. So I think what I
[6435.02s -> 6440.54s]  have to do is just go risk on, keep the risk on and just go. I'm sweating.
[6441.34s -> 6579.37s]  What the hell are you doing? I just had to go because like that's the hardest jump and I was
[6579.37s -> 6587.14s]  like, I just, I didn't realize I was still holding shift. I was still holding shift and I didn't
[6587.14s -> 6598.18s]  realize it was still holding it. It was the, it was just, my finger was still on it. I was, I was
[6598.18s -> 6604.76s]  good. I threw so hard. I don't want to hear anything from this person. Don't be afraid. You
[6604.84s -> 6618.23s]  can always repeat. Oh, my accolades. Oh, that's sad. That jump is not shift. The one before it
[6618.23s -> 6632.10s]  can be. Oh, I'm so sad. I'm so mad. My accolades. No, my accolades. I can get back there. I can,
[6632.10s -> 6635.94s]  let me get back there. I just didn't even get to the balloons. Why are the stupid crane?
[6636.02s -> 6647.75s]  That crane part I'm fucking furious at. Don't let Captain Crunch win. Yeah, he's cracking up right
[6647.75s -> 6669.42s]  now. Get it out. There's still three minutes left. Yeah, my problem was that that's a regular running
[6669.42s -> 6681.54s]  jump. Fucked it up. It's all right. It's all right. We're hanging out. We're here. Just say,
[6681.54s -> 6696.22s]  God, go, go like pet your dog for a little while. Come back. Like 10 minutes. Sometimes it's hard
[6696.22s -> 6701.50s]  to choose the right path, but don't be afraid. You can always repeat. We learn from our mistakes.
[6702.06s -> 6706.94s]  See that save right there? That's from experience. That's from playing this game for an hour and
[6706.94s -> 6729.66s]  having experience. Shut up. OK. Oh, some of those jumps were so hard, too. And I was nailing them.
[6729.66s -> 6733.34s]  I was nailing some of those. You know what I mean? Like you were watching you were like,
[6733.34s -> 6739.08s]  holy shit, he's kind of nailing this on the second time he's ever seen it. I was nailing it.
[6739.08s -> 6748.30s]  Any other like game show music to fucking get me pumped up? I got to have like game show theme
[6748.30s -> 6772.97s]  songs. That's a good one. Family Feud theme. That was kind of like goofy, though, isn't it?
[6772.97s -> 6792.76s]  It's like it's like it's like circus music, isn't it? Yeah, this guy is too goofy.
[6794.14s -> 6802.63s]  American Bible Challenge. Yeah, absolutely. That's now you know, you're speaking my language.
[6803.27s -> 6816.81s]  OK, American Bible Challenge theme song. This is 20 seconds. This is going to get
[6817.29s -> 6824.71s]  become unbearable after a little while. All right. The American Bible Challenge theme song.
[6824.71s -> 6843.99s]  Oh, I can't. This is not going to work. We need something else. We need something else.
[6843.99s -> 6850.09s]  That's not going to be OK. We'll go back to Family Feud. Whatever. It's not like I'm going
[6850.09s -> 6856.42s]  to get back to her. This is for it. I don't need to loop it. It's already an hour long video.
[6865.99s -> 6904.63s]  No, guys, why would I listen to this version when I can listen to this one? This is fucking good.
[6907.56s -> 6941.32s]  Holy shit. This is great. I thought it was a bird at first. I love this so much.
[6941.32s -> 6965.54s]  This is actually fucking great. Why did I look at chat? That was awesome. All right. What else?
[6965.54s -> 6974.66s]  I need something that I can just put back here. Who wants to be a millionaire? No,
[6974.66s -> 6982.52s]  that like we need something with a beat, something old to supermarket sweep. I don't know.
[6983.40s -> 6987.24s]  I mean, I'm going to my whole channel is going to get shut off, but I don't do the fates.
[6987.24s -> 6991.98s]  I feel like that's a pretty good one. Whatever. I don't give a shit. I'm putting it on.
[6991.98s -> 7049.43s]  I just want to just one and that's it. What's going on? What's going on? That's so low.
[7049.43s -> 7061.42s]  The beginning is really quiet. Oh, I should probably turn it down then.
[7085.69s -> 7089.93s]  I don't care anymore. This month for like five seconds. Um, I need like
[7089.93s -> 7102.81s]  catchy something that can sit in the background. Oprah's theme, the crystal light aerobics theme.
[7102.81s -> 7140.90s]  This is good. I'm into it. The 1988 crystal light national aerobic championship.
[7140.90s -> 7208.76s]  Excuse me. What the hell was that? Oh, my accolades. What the fuck is happening?
[7209.48s -> 7212.68s]  Why does that keep happening? That hasn't, I, that's not, that's a twice in a row.
[7213.32s -> 7228.41s]  The song is cursed by accolades. So that song's cursed. I like it though. Um,
[7228.41s -> 7242.84s]  the smash brothers pac-man music. Ooh, that's a good one. That's a really good one.
[7242.84s -> 7272.86s]  You know, one that goes, risk on. I got to ride the roller coaster though. We can't even get
[7272.86s -> 7286.18s]  hyped up yet. I'm saving this because we have to ride the roller coaster and I,
[7288.14s -> 7300.12s]  uh, just give it a minute. Give it a minute. Why are these games have to be so addicting?
[7304.31s -> 7319.37s]  These games with total complete failure, they have to be so addicting. And it's like the heck.
[7319.37s -> 7326.36s]  Okay. So what keeps happening here? I've been standing in the same spot each time. It's right
[7326.36s -> 7338.41s]  here. This just kind of goes kind of completely off the rails. The game's bugged. The game's bugged.
[7338.41s -> 7346.30s]  The game is bugged. There's a bug. Am I going to have to walk the train track?
[7353.50s -> 7359.35s]  Walk the tracks. Dude, that sucks. I guess I could. That's not a problem.
[7359.35s -> 7373.03s]  Some of those jumps are going to be hard without the, without the train. Aren't they?
[7373.03s -> 7375.21s]  On camera. What are you doing?
[7404.87s -> 7418.42s]  Music on. Not yet. I got to get to a spot where I'm comfortable. Why am I doing this?
[7418.42s -> 7436.09s]  Because the cart is bugged and keeps kicking me off. I can be, I am my own cart right now.
[7436.09s -> 7466.86s]  All right. Here we are. I just smashed a big peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Nice.
[7466.86s -> 7499.14s]  Oh, wait, which way do I go? Okay. This way. Oh, why am I looking? I hope you enjoy your sandwich.
[7502.66s -> 7512.97s]  I just ride the car. Oh my God. My hair just dude. And that's not where I want to be, man.
[7512.97s -> 7526.95s]  This bugs out again that I'm just going to reset the game accolades by accolades.
[7526.95s -> 7540.06s]  Oh, don't give them to me. So is it something in the road? I've done this,
[7540.06s -> 7546.50s]  ridden this thing like five to 10 times already and I never get like launched out.
[7546.50s -> 7556.70s]  That is a bug in the game and it needs to be fixed whenever the developer has time.
[7556.70s -> 7567.00s]  Making a game, patching a game, the whole operation. A lot goes into it. A lot of code and
[7567.00s -> 7603.34s]  shit. Why do I look like Jesus? Centrist Andy. All right. What do you say we wake up a little
[7603.34s -> 7621.64s]  when I get here? I'm going to wipe my hands. I'm going to wipe my face. Wipe your ass too.
[7639.80s -> 7655.40s]  This game is, can you hear that? You hear a fucking fast, my heart is going and
[7656.28s -> 7747.42s]  Oh, and wipe your ass too. Quick name your four person video game party.
[7747.42s -> 7754.73s]  Pac-Man, Star Fox, Link and Solid Snake would be in mine.
[7784.44s -> 7820.06s]  What about the portal companion cube? Yeah, I forgot.
[7871.99s -> 7895.48s]  Excuse me. Sorry. I need a new song that got me up here. We need something better than that to get
[7895.48s -> 7915.61s]  me to where we just were. I need something better than that. It's going to be hard though.
[7915.61s -> 7918.65s]  Pizza tower would be pretty good here, but I feel like we overuse it.
[7918.65s -> 7921.59s]  All right. We'll do the, what's, what's the one that goes like
[7924.23s -> 7928.62s]  that's game of the year by the way, unless Final Fantasy 16 is like better
[7928.62s -> 7948.52s]  that in Res, uh, Resident Evil 4. Uh, was it called hurry up or something? This is it.
[7951.05s -> 7953.93s]  All right. I'm going to be fucking crazy right now. Are you ready?
[7954.57s -> 7971.32s]  You're going to think my hands have just like sticky tape or sticky glue all over it. Whatever.
[7971.32s -> 7978.42s]  I'm not going to miss a single jump. This is where it counts. This, this part is fucking hard.
[7979.22s -> 8179.90s]  Risk on. Oh, I just stepped in dog shit. Oh, this music's changing. I need something better than
[8179.90s -> 8202.33s]  that. This is not bad either. Do lap two music. I'm not doing fall guys. Oh yeah. The sans theme
[8202.33s -> 8220.60s]  song. That's a good one too. That might be too, that may be too much city escape. That's the, uh,
[8220.60s -> 8227.96s]  I feel like that one's going to fuck me up, but I'll do it. That's going to, that's going to screw
[8227.96s -> 8295.59s]  it up. But look, we're going to be fine. I want to see bat chests only. If you just came to the
[8295.59s -> 8301.75s]  stream right now, you would be like, holy shit, this chat is fucking toxic. This chat is awful.
[8302.63s -> 8307.99s]  He's playing a song he likes and they're just fucking roasting them. This chat is so bad is
[8307.99s -> 8314.79s]  what people would say. Just like, man, holy shit. He's just getting completely fucking roasted.
[8314.79s -> 8344.38s]  I'm going to start it over. Oh yeah. Get up there. I'm not in it anymore. All right. Important right
[8344.38s -> 8428.89s]  here. Can I turn it up? I'll turn it up louder. What the hell? I'm stuck.
[8451.51s -> 8458.22s]  I got stuck on something. What did I get stuck on? Do you see my character was like,
[8459.02s -> 8469.26s]  well, I got fucking strapped on something. What was that? My character didn't even jump. He just
[8469.26s -> 8479.90s]  went fucking. God damn it. Where do I go from here? I'm it's, but we're fine. I've, this is not that
[8479.90s -> 8492.58s]  far. How am I? This goofy ass music. Now it's not, this is Mario brothers. This is not goofy
[8492.58s -> 8504.26s]  ass music. It's, it's, it's a little goofy. Okay. It's going on my voice today. That's a little
[8504.26s -> 8515.72s]  goofy. Where, how do I get it? Shut this off. My character, I was running for the jump and he just
[8515.72s -> 8530.58s]  went like, he just like, how do I get back over there? The left, I can't make this jump. Oh,
[8530.58s -> 8548.82s]  there you mean like over there. Fuck. Oh no. You only get one of those this year. Perfect.
[8557.99s -> 8564.47s]  This is not that bad. I got stuck. Oh, I would be so much more angry at that if it wasn't really
[8564.47s -> 8584.14s]  funny. That was like the 11th one you've done this year. Well, there's a long, a year is a long time.
[8587.83s -> 8596.12s]  I got this. I got this completely done at this point. It was so stupid. Yeah. We're going music
[8596.12s -> 8608.65s]  list for right now. Let me just get back to where I was. Why don't I just like skip this whole thing?
[8609.45s -> 8623.42s]  I mean, that was what I did last time. Let's do it again. The music is helps you though.
[8624.06s -> 8647.10s]  How about this goofy ass music back on? Oh no, that's it. That jump is the worst because no,
[8647.10s -> 8659.82s]  turn it off. Um, how about, I love Super Mario. I grew up with this game. Don't forget that.
[8660.94s -> 8667.19s]  I grew up playing Super Mario World. It was like the game. Super Mario World was the Fortnite when
[8667.19s -> 8674.04s]  I was like fucking 10. Come on. This is my Fortnite here. Don't you tell me what my Fortnite is and
[8674.04s -> 8701.53s]  isn't. Was this back in the forties? Chrono Trigger battle music. That's not the one I want.
[8701.85s -> 8733.67s]  I want the original. I want the original. Where's the original? Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to,
[8733.67s -> 8737.51s]  I'm going to add that to my likes on YouTube. I'll listen to that one like five to 10,000 times
[8737.51s -> 8765.40s]  later tonight. Where's the original one? These are all like the remake in the remaster. I mean,
[8765.40s -> 8773.21s]  I've got a way better one. Uh, this is, I'm not going to say what, um, what this is, but this is
[8773.21s -> 8779.67s]  a good one. This is, don't be, people are going to say, say in Chrono Trigger spoilers. So just
[8779.67s -> 8785.50s]  fucking relax. Okay. Be careful in the chat. Cause when I play this, this is, this one is a banger.
[8785.50s -> 8789.26s]  This is an absolute banger. You can bad chest me. That's fine. But this is one of the final themes
[8789.26s -> 8794.38s]  of the game. Here it comes. And it's going to get me to the top. This shit's going to get me to the
[8794.38s -> 8809.45s]  fucking top of this game. It's not the right one. Wait. No, it is. It is. It is. It is. No, it is.
[8809.45s -> 8898.74s]  Let's go. Oh, freaking Chrono Trigger. This is wrong. Here's the right one. It's going to get
[8898.74s -> 8949.98s]  loud. This is like a four minute intro. Hold on a second. How long is this part? Let's go.
[8955.96s -> 9012.34s]  I got to get out of this fucking industrial area. It's going to get loud. Oh, don't look at chat.
[9012.34s -> 9052.47s]  Don't look at them. I just, I just ran into the collision. What the fuck? Can I even save this?
[9052.47s -> 9095.80s]  I was running, running to jump and then fall. Why is this a slowed down version of the song
[9095.88s -> 9111.62s]  I was just listening to? It's mocking me. Use the elevator. I don't think the elevator works.
[9111.62s -> 9116.81s]  Sometimes it's hard to choose the right path, but don't be afraid. You can always repeat.
[9116.81s -> 9123.51s]  We learn from our mistakes. I didn't make a mistake. I didn't make a mistake. Clip it.
[9123.51s -> 9138.71s]  Clip it. You fell on purpose. No, I went to run on the barrel and I've done that jump like four
[9138.71s -> 9144.07s]  times. This time I apparently was hitting a weird collision part of the barrel and I Super Mario
[9144.07s -> 9165.86s]  mid animations got stuck in and fell. He's, he's actually angry. I got it out of my system.
[9165.86s -> 9183.30s]  I'm going again. This is, this doesn't do anything though. All right. This time we're going to slow
[9183.30s -> 9211.08s]  it down. We're going to play like fucking piano, like royalty free piano, and I'm going to go slow.
[9211.08s -> 9220.92s]  Use night mode. It's said soon. Should I just go get water and put tears coming down my eyes
[9220.92s -> 9230.70s]  and just have a cry face for like 30 minutes? Hold on. Should I say like watching like a sad
[9230.70s -> 9260.36s]  movie on my other monitor? Hold on a minute. Watching Titanic on other monitor. I'll just like
[9260.36s -> 9272.90s]  glance over here all the time and just be like, this needs to be a little bigger. Give me one
[9272.90s -> 9433.72s]  second. I'm going to pee. I'm back. Okay. So let's do this. Can you like, can you see if I do this?
[9433.72s -> 9462.52s]  Can you see it? You can't see it? Hold on. I'll turn the light on. Give me a sec. I'm not going
[9462.52s -> 9484.50s]  to pour it on my face. Okay. You should be able to see a little bit better now. I put a bunch of
[9486.02s -> 9502.92s]  tears. Hold on. Hold on. Just wait. You can see better now, right? So if I go like this,
[9502.92s -> 9540.15s]  is that showing up better? Kinda. Fuck. I can't see it. You need to look wet. You just look wet.
[9540.15s -> 9550.33s]  I just look like I'm covered in fucking water. Just stick your whole head in the, no. Hold on.
[9550.33s -> 9615.83s]  You just look sweaty. God. I'm sorry guys. I've never seen this fucking movie before.
[9615.83s -> 9636.28s]  This is fucking awful. I'm turning this off. I'm turning this off. Why would I? This is awful.
[9636.28s -> 9643.03s]  This is the worst fucking thing I've ever done. This is not funny. I'm just wet. I'm just wet.
[9643.03s -> 9653.30s]  I've just, it's like I got hit in the face with a water balloon. I need red eyes. I'm just
[9653.30s -> 9661.30s]  fucking sweaty. Oh yeah. I've never seen this movie before. I'm like really sweating. I actually
[9661.30s -> 9671.26s]  kind of feel good. I can't even listen to this song anymore. Let me turn, hold on. You need to,
[9671.26s -> 9684.82s]  no. I'm fucking done. I'm playing the game now. Why would you even stream at that point? Did I
[9684.82s -> 9692.26s]  tell you guys my bit that I wanted to do so bad? It was to do, you know, whatever. Steal it. Whoever.
[9692.26s -> 9699.21s]  It's just, I get, I get 5% royalties. I want to do full cam react to a movie that's not happening.
[9699.85s -> 9705.69s]  And it's like an hour and 35 minutes of me sitting there reacting to like the Mario movie,
[9705.69s -> 9709.05s]  but it's, I'm not actually watching it. And you, like, we're going to watch it together.
[9709.05s -> 9720.23s]  I want 10% royalties if you do that. Just sit there and I'll be reacting to shit like, oh dude,
[9720.23s -> 9725.11s]  Toad, what the fuck is Toad doing? Toad might not even be on the screen. He might not even be on
[9725.11s -> 9730.26s]  camera. And I sit there for an hour and 30 minutes and pretend like we're doing a watch along of the
[9730.26s -> 9743.02s]  Mario movie. That's pretty good, right? Or make it generic. We're going to do a watch along.
[9743.66s -> 9751.46s]  I can imagine like, hey, hey everybody. Today we're doing a watch along of whatever movie you're
[9751.46s -> 9757.78s]  watching, whatever movie you care about. So right now we can, we can queue it up if we want to start.
[9757.78s -> 9761.99s]  It doesn't matter what movie you're watching. You and I are watching it together. And three,
[9761.99s -> 9764.55s]  two, one. It doesn't matter what movie you're watching. I just sit there for an hour and 40
[9764.55s -> 9770.60s]  minutes and I fake watch a movie and queue it up with everything and anything. Queue it up with
[9770.60s -> 9785.61s]  the Smurfs movie for all I care. Get up and go to the bathroom and come back 30 minutes later.
[9785.61s -> 9791.51s]  I don't get it. Neither do I, but I think it's funny. Well, okay. Would you guys play along?
[9791.51s -> 9794.47s]  Would you guys, if I did that on stream, why would, why would it be a stream? I would just
[9794.47s -> 9803.77s]  upload this video. I would just give it to you guys and you just put it on anything. I don't care.
[9803.77s -> 9809.43s]  You, you'd play along? Why does this camera look brighter? All right. All right. All right. I'm
[9809.43s -> 9813.37s]  going to give one more attempt. I said I was only going to stream for like, like three hours today.
[9813.37s -> 9823.86s]  So let's, let's get back to it. I would, I would. The edits of that to various scenes would be
[9823.86s -> 9835.46s]  fucking gold. I think it would be really funny. I'm getting booed. Three hour stream. Yeah. Three
[9835.46s -> 9843.86s]  hour stream. Your light is on. Oh, it's, no, it's off. I think I just, the color corrected the camera.
[9843.86s -> 9849.16s]  All right. Let me, I'm not messing around. Let's actually go for it. I'm going to try to win.
[9849.16s -> 9859.56s]  I'm going to try to actually do it. Peewee dance. Liar. Go back in front of the green screen. Okay.
[9859.56s -> 9865.05s]  What if, what if I go back in front of the green screen and just sit facing a movie theater? Like
[9865.05s -> 9869.13s]  as if I'm facing a, you know, the projector's behind me and I'm sitting there and I just keep
[9869.13s -> 9873.61s]  looking back and keep talking to you and stuff. Like you're, you're sitting next to me or sitting
[9873.61s -> 9883.85s]  behind me. And not like MST 3K. More like I'm just your annoying friend and I'm just reacting
[9883.85s -> 9901.18s]  to the movie that I don't know what it is. Okay. All right. Just, just public domain. You know,
[9901.18s -> 9907.19s]  here's the thing, here's the thing though. That's a galaxy brand idea. You would crack up in five
[9907.19s -> 9914.30s]  minutes. No, I would, I would be dedicated to it. It would have to be exactly, or how about this?
[9914.38s -> 9922.81s]  I got an even better idea. I react to a movie that you do not know. And you have to figure out
[9922.81s -> 9933.43s]  what movie I'm actually reacting to. And I don't give you very many hints. I think that's kind of
[9933.43s -> 9952.66s]  fun too. How come this guy talks so much? Um, it's my, one of my only skills is talking well.
[9952.66s -> 9963.38s]  And sometimes I don't even do that very good. Bro, this is what? I'm good. I'm good. I've got
[9963.38s -> 9972.17s]  plenty of skills. Don't worry. Green screen was bad. I could do it more than once. Who cares?
[9972.17s -> 9978.36s]  I also have that video that I'm working on that I'm just going to premiere it on stream. And I
[9978.36s -> 9983.16s]  might not even upload it anywhere. Imagine him reacting as if it's the Mario movie and someone
[9983.16s -> 9990.58s]  puts it over saw. Well, here's the thing. It would have to just be for fun only because you guys
[9990.58s -> 9997.70s]  wouldn't be able to upload it anywhere. That's like, you know, copyright infringement DMCA shit.
[9997.70s -> 10002.42s]  You can't just upload an entire movie with me in the corner. That's just not how that works.
[10002.42s -> 10009.13s]  So, I mean, maybe just for fun for you just to kind of put on whatever. I don't know. Dude,
[10009.13s -> 10017.53s]  it didn't even be Yahoo yet. The Truman cut. Well, the Truman show cut was essentially the, I was,
[10017.53s -> 10023.30s]  I was in every scene replacing actors and stuff. This would just be me in the corner watching
[10023.30s -> 10034.07s]  the movie. You can't do that on any platform. You can't do that. What about the peewee promise?
[10034.07s -> 10038.57s]  All right, I'm going to play the game now. I'm going to go one or two more solid tries and then
[10038.57s -> 10053.66s]  we'll call it there. Short stream today. Short stream. He loves lying. I don't love lying. I love
[10053.66s -> 10063.13s]  making up shit. That's lying. It's coming up with weird ideas lying by its very nature. It's like
[10063.13s -> 10070.54s]  making up shit. I like to make up scenarios. I like to make up stuff, make up like stories and
[10070.54s -> 10078.22s]  characters and stuff. I am a, am I just a liar by trade? That's just a, is that a story? I'm
[10078.22s -> 10096.55s]  not a liar. I'm a storyteller. This part of the movie is so sad. I'm not lying. I'm just making
[10096.55s -> 10109.18s]  shit up. All right. Let's try. Both headphones going in. Nice piano music. No copyright,
[10109.18s -> 10112.70s]  except the whole stream is coming down anyways, because the whole stream has been copyright
[10112.70s -> 10129.21s]  music, but whatever. This one's nice. You sound like a super villain. I'm just a guy. I'm just a
[10129.21s -> 10143.77s]  guy. Stop jumping up and down on the same wall over and over again. Play the game. Play the game.
[10143.77s -> 10171.59s]  Oh, that is the right way. He's just, just a silly, a silly little guy. You have a terrible
[10171.59s -> 10181.99s]  tension span. You don't have the attention span of a, this is actually kind of intense. I don't
[10181.99s -> 10193.88s]  have the attention span of a regular guy. I, I'm just a regular guy. How do I fix hip pain? I don't
[10193.88s -> 10203.85s]  know. A lot of my pain problems are up here and like the sternum. I would go to a doctor. I don't
[10203.93s -> 10217.93s]  have very much I can tell you. Sorry. Unfortunately, your heart, uh, no, it's more sternum.
[10217.93s -> 10225.22s]  I had my heart checked and it was fine. I, dude, I had every, every single system in my whole body
[10225.22s -> 10240.97s]  was checked when I took that break in 2020. Oh, I was like, what's going, what's this competing?
[10241.53s -> 10255.59s]  All right. I'm going to try to keep a straight face while I do this, but it's going to be really
[10255.59s -> 10267.85s]  difficult. I'm putting on three or four different piano royalty free tracks. They're just going to
[10267.85s -> 10271.94s]  be competing. Imagine being at a bar or like a club or something and like a lounge.
[10273.96s -> 10278.20s]  This is like three people on pianos. By the way, can we talk about this for one second? I know
[10278.20s -> 10283.82s]  I'm supposed to be playing the game, but who cares? Did we already talk about who, why the
[10283.82s -> 10290.25s]  fuck would you have a P like a big grand piano in your house? You know, like, oh, well, I have
[10290.25s -> 10304.07s]  a big piano. We already talked about this. Did we do that? Did I talk about pianos yet? No. Okay.
[10304.07s -> 10308.89s]  All right. So when you have a house, like you still say you buy a house. It's like, oh yeah,
[10308.89s -> 10313.67s]  I got a house now. Okay. Yeah, I got a house. You know what I really, really want in a room in the
[10313.67s -> 10319.78s]  house? Just a giant fucking piano. I don't, but if you don't play it, I don't know how many people
[10319.78s -> 10327.16s]  play those pianos. Like, oh, the, the paint on the wall. Maybe I'll change the floors. Maybe I'll
[10327.16s -> 10340.01s]  redesign one of the rooms. Grand piano. If you don't play, if you're not a pianist, they take up,
[10340.01s -> 10344.17s]  they take up an entire, they take up like a huge amount of square footage in a house.
[10344.25s -> 10361.48s]  A pianist. You immature little bastards. All right, let's go. It's a pianist.
[10363.16s -> 10372.17s]  I'm not saying it again, but I've never once in my whole life been like, you know, I really looking
[10372.17s -> 10403.19s]  like I want a big grand piano in that room. I forget how to play the game. Everyone stop.
[10403.19s -> 10404.87s]  Can I do my stupid little routine now?
[10405.35s -> 10410.04s]  But don't be afraid. You can always repeat. You learn from our mistakes.
[10410.04s -> 10422.31s]  I like your Batman hair. Ludwig beat this game. Ludwig beat this game. How long did it take Ludwig
[10422.31s -> 10438.33s]  to beat this? How long did it take Ludwig to do this? Nine hours? Eight hours? What the fuck?
[10438.33s -> 10452.26s]  How? Did Stur beat this? Oh, the piano songs. All right, here we go. This is going to be unbearable.
[10452.82s -> 10458.57s]  This is just one of those streams. Vinny, did Vinny beat it too? Who, who, whatever. All right,
[10458.57s -> 10464.50s]  this is going to be awful, but I don't care. I'm just imagining like three people
[10465.48s -> 10468.76s]  and different pianos all trying to play different music over each other. All right,
[10468.76s -> 10475.86s]  we'll see if this is funny. This one's called soft piano music. All right, let's try it.
[10475.86s -> 10525.58s]  Here we go. No laughing, straight face only. This is just what it was like inside of every
[10525.58s -> 10536.07s]  Radio Shack in America. Every single Radio Shack in America sounded like this. Every one of them.
[10536.07s -> 10564.49s]  It's just people like playing keyboards in every aisle. I can't fucking do it anymore.
[10564.49s -> 10578.63s]  We're going to leave one of them on. More, more pianos. You're going to crash my computer.
[10578.63s -> 10630.02s]  My computer's hanging right now. Once I have eight open, I'm done. This sounds like someone's
[10630.02s -> 10648.58s]  shit face playing the piano. Like they're good, but they've had like eight cocktails. Okay,
[10648.58s -> 10682.55s]  last one. I can't do more than this. This is like when an orchestra is about to start actually
[10682.55s -> 10688.73s]  playing a song. They all like play at the same time. And then it's like, it kind of sounds
[10688.73s -> 10700.87s]  fucking weird. And then they stop. All right, that's enough. I'm going. No emotion. Add a
[10700.87s -> 10754.06s]  cheering soundtrack too. Like it's like a stadium. Stadium cheering sounds. One hour. I forgot where
[10754.06s -> 10792.63s]  to go. All right. Add car driving sounds. Wait, it's picking up. I've heard this one before.
[10799.11s -> 10814.73s]  One of them. It's Club Penguin. That's what it is. I feel like I'm going to have a nightmare
[10814.73s -> 10873.22s]  later tonight. They're not happy anymore. They're not happy. Oh shit. Then they're very unhappy.
[10873.22s -> 10885.03s]  I keep closing tabs and it's still going. You know, I think about like, man, like our youth today,
[10885.03s -> 10891.35s]  like all these crazy videos and Tik Tok and all like the big brain rot and stuff. Look what I
[10891.35s -> 10901.46s]  just did to all of you. You know what I mean? Like all the youth today, all the consuming
[10901.54s -> 10906.50s]  Tik Tok videos. I'm going to play 10 piano sound effects with cheering and booing and
[10906.50s -> 10929.02s]  farting and screaming sounds. It's me too. It's me too. I kind of miss it. And only a thousand
[10929.02s -> 10946.71s]  people left. That's actually kind of surprising. I don't know why I'm going for like a high score.
[10946.71s -> 10954.62s]  Okay. Let's try it for real. No jokey shit. No bullshit. I got it. All right. Tell me the truth.
[10954.62s -> 10963.80s]  No messing around. Did I do a good job as high as I got? I got to pretty much where the balloons are.
[10963.80s -> 10969.06s]  Did I do a good job? Did I do all right? I think I did okay. I actually surprised I got as high as
[10969.06s -> 10980.33s]  I did. That one crane kind of, when I fell off the crane all the way up where the balloons are,
[10980.33s -> 10985.05s]  that's when the pianos were starting to play in my head. It was just like, oh shit, it's over.
[10985.05s -> 10998.17s]  But we're good. I'm having fun. That's like 15% of the way through the game. It's true. I did say I
[10998.17s -> 11016.94s]  was going to try to get past 10%. Charlie Speed runs this game. I want to watch that. I feel like
[11016.94s -> 11034.20s]  that's very interesting to see. Put on club. Okay, we're good. Please, subway surfers. No.
[11050.54s -> 11062.30s]  Charlie's life. Is Charlie, is he playing it right now? How much further than me is he right now?
[11072.18s -> 11082.94s]  Like 5%. Those bits sapped him of all of his energy. Yeah, they kind of did.
[11082.94s -> 11102.14s]  Too many like funny sound effects. Is your discomfort? I just want to, I want to get back up
[11102.70s -> 11107.91s]  I'm going to try one more time. Somebody said funny in quotes.
[11114.26s -> 11120.33s]  Yeah, I'll allow that. I will allow that. That doesn't mean I'm going to not.
[11121.66s -> 11126.14s]  No, I'm not going to time you up. No, I'm going to be nice today.
[11126.70s -> 11134.70s]  No music. I'll turn the actual sounds back up though.
[11135.90s -> 11164.46s]  I think I just fell off. Okay, back to normal. Geez. This is fun though. See what I mean? See
[11164.46s -> 11173.90s]  what I mean? That's happened a few times in a bad spot. Risk on. Maybe when we get up a little
[11173.90s -> 11187.61s]  higher. Please put public domain movies in the corner. All right, so you can go like this on
[11187.61s -> 11193.27s]  your iPad and just zoom in on that movie and not even watch the stream anymore. Now you're,
[11193.27s -> 11210.94s]  I'm here right now. You know what's crazy? The part coming up here with all those little
[11210.94s -> 11215.94s]  jumps, the really, really scary ones. I flawlessly executed, but then I'll just fall off the edge
[11215.94s -> 11233.02s]  over here. Weird. Subway servers, please. A public domain movie instead of a face cam.
[11233.02s -> 11253.62s]  I actually like that idea. That's funny. That's very humorous. All right. If I get across this,
[11260.39s -> 11291.45s]  don't go fast. This is my last attempt. So do it right. Oh my God. I'm so I guess with repetition,
[11291.45s -> 11298.42s]  you kind of just burn into muscle memory, how to do all this stuff. I do wish. I mean,
[11298.42s -> 11308.02s]  I'm a checkpoint, Andy. I like checkpoints. It's also possible that I haven't come across
[11308.02s -> 11328.42s]  a checkpoint because I haven't gotten far enough. That's very possible. Oh my goodness. I didn't
[11328.42s -> 11335.50s]  grab onto anything, but I'm so good. All right. The worst is here. This is like technically one
[11335.50s -> 11362.09s]  of the worst parts. Slow it down and get it right and good. Right here. All right. This part sucks.
[11362.73s -> 11367.05s]  Every time I get here, I look and I kind of gulp like a cartoon because it's always stressful.
[11368.92s -> 11386.57s]  It's very easy to screw this up. Did you see the new spider verse? I did not.
[11387.21s -> 11397.69s]  I want to though. I want to. Careful. Get it right. I've done this jump like five times now.
[11398.33s -> 11423.45s]  No reason to overthink it. This part is the worst because I always feel like I'm not going to make
[11423.45s -> 11441.86s]  it, but somehow I just do every time. Scary. Okay. Almost at the industrial area. That's the
[11441.86s -> 11458.76s]  hardest jump of this whole map. Actually might be this one here. All right. Oh, I just scared
[11458.76s -> 11495.29s]  the shit out of somebody, but I scared the shit out of myself. So we both got scared. Okay. That
[11495.29s -> 11504.38s]  one is deceiving because it's really not that it's really not hard. It just looks hard. All right.
[11504.38s -> 11523.05s]  Breather. Jeez, dude. What are you doing? Okay. The last couple of times this is this has been a
[11523.05s -> 11529.35s]  disaster. The last couple of times I was here, I have progressed like 30 minutes ahead of this.
[11530.07s -> 11557.22s]  For some reason, it's this stupid area right here. Up there is what I'm talking about. This
[11557.22s -> 11577.29s]  part's kind of hard too, but just be careful. Not that big of a deal. Really not. You got further in
[11577.29s -> 11581.96s]  10 minutes than I did in three hours. Well, I've been streaming for three hours and I've been
[11581.96s -> 11598.54s]  streaming this game for three hours. So we are at the same spot. Think about it. This is what
[11598.54s -> 11609.24s]  screwed me up last time and it was fine. What happened the last time I got there? Honestly,
[11609.24s -> 11643.54s]  what happened? You lagged out. I'm almost at the awful jump that screwed me up last time. I might
[11643.54s -> 11651.24s]  not even do it. I might just sit. If I stay on it, it'll throw me off though, won't it? It'll throw
[11651.24s -> 11667.83s]  me off. You don't jump off the platform. Won't it toss me? It won't. I feel like it like threw me
[11667.83s -> 11675.37s]  last time. Or am I just crazy? It will not toss you. You need to jump. Well, that's what I tried.
[11675.37s -> 11697.40s]  I tried to jump last time and it just kind of like, don't jump yet. God. Okay. Well, here we go.
[11697.40s -> 11712.12s]  You've got to be shitting me. Thank goodness. I hit the wire. God damn it. That's the end of
[11712.44s -> 11753.40s]  I better not be soft-locked. Okay. We're good. I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it because
[11753.40s -> 11764.15s]  I didn't think I was good. Well, I thought I was good. So we're good. This part is freaking me out
[11764.15s -> 11775.38s]  though. I've gotten here two, three other times and just falling off. Yeah. You fell off. Yeah.
[11775.38s -> 11787.32s]  I know. It's whatever. Yeah. You peeked at Shpee. I know. I've heard it all before. A little bit of
[11787.32s -> 11796.57s]  Shpee. A little bit of Shpee. That's one of my favorite streams just because I've said it a
[11796.57s -> 11801.50s]  million times, but I'm going to reiterate it over and over again. It's just like that. I say that
[11801.50s -> 11807.53s]  all the time, right? I say that all the time. Those actors were given just like a little
[11807.53s -> 11814.10s]  20 minute package of things to study and like, Ooh, hot cup of cider. As if those are my catch
[11814.10s -> 11825.59s]  phrases. Ooh, Shpee. I haven't said that in nine years. I love that so much. They got such a small
[11825.59s -> 11834.34s]  window of what like I've done in 12 years that like most of it was from like 2012. Perfect. I
[11834.34s -> 11853.66s]  love it. Okay. Here we go. Don't hit the wire. All right. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. We're back
[11853.66s -> 11867.88s]  and another 10, 20 feet or so. And I'm, I'm game progress. Well, more like a hundred feet. I got
[11867.88s -> 11889.72s]  way higher than this last time. This is a weird thing. I did this. This part was a little weird,
[11889.72s -> 11897.24s]  but I'll be good. Just do it slow. There's no reason to go risk on right now. Holy shit. I
[11897.24s -> 11923.48s]  almost didn't get it. This is where I failed. That's I know what happened. I know what happened.
[11923.48s -> 11928.60s]  Why did I fall? I know what happened though. Stupid. Oh my God. Those little things that look
[11928.60s -> 11933.80s]  sick. That's true. That's a kaizo block. That's a fucking kaizo block. You got to be fucking
[11933.80s -> 11938.78s]  shitting me. That's a kaizo block. There's like a little thing on the ground and it makes you
[11938.78s -> 11950.49s]  fucking just walk off. It's a kaizo block. You're going to be shitting me. There is like a little
[11950.49s -> 11957.94s]  tiny staple on that thing that just pushes you off. If you walk into it as annoying,
[11957.94s -> 11965.29s]  I'm annoyed now. I didn't walk off. Go clip it. Go look at it. The things collision is as big as
[11965.93s -> 11974.82s]  10 people's feet. I'm annoyed now. You have to jump over those or they just push you off. Now
[11974.82s -> 11993.70s]  I know that and I'm pissed. Come on. You got like six inches to walk and there's a little
[11993.70s -> 12000.02s]  staple sticking out of the ground will push you off the map. You have to jump. There's three of
[12000.02s -> 12006.66s]  them. I saw them. I even said to myself, I was like, that thing is weird and sticking out of
[12006.66s -> 12031.05s]  the ground and I walked into it and kaizo block die. Well, now I know. Now I know that the
[12032.09s -> 12039.11s]  little fucking speed bump sticking out of the ground, the little like it's a little tiny little
[12039.11s -> 12065.03s]  thing. If you touch it, if you walk into it, it's just what the fuck I was and that's what happened
[12065.03s -> 12070.52s]  last time and I was confused last time too. I was like, why did I, why did I fall off? Why did my
[12070.52s -> 12076.34s]  character walk off the edge? And now I know a little staple. Oh, I could, I could repeat myself
[12076.34s -> 12086.17s]  a hundred times. That didn't happen in the third time. I'm getting up there just to just to fucking
[12086.17s -> 12105.00s]  fight this game. Walking over a speed bump. I mean, no proof, Andy. I didn't walk off of it. I
[12105.00s -> 12115.56s]  literally, it pushed me off of the fucking thing. I'm watching it right now. That's, I know what
[12115.56s -> 12120.92s]  happened. I'm telling you right now. Why would I walk off the edge like that? You've seen me walk
[12120.92s -> 12127.42s]  on. I just put, I just, my character just fucking went over the edge. I promise you,
[12129.29s -> 12135.19s]  there's no reason why I would have done that. You've seen me walk on smaller ledges than that.
[12135.19s -> 12143.35s]  Oh, hey, I'm at the area. That is like, I got to it. I was really happy I got back to the area. Let
[12143.35s -> 12163.80s]  me walk off the edge now. Let me just like walk sideways. You should have adjusted. I'm going to
[12164.44s -> 12169.59s]  wait till you play it and you're going to, you're going to have the same Larry David response that
[12169.59s -> 12175.10s]  I had. You're going to go, that stream is an idiot. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[12175.10s -> 12181.02s]  You're going to walk right over it and then you're going to go, and then the fucking music's
[12181.02s -> 12215.18s]  going to play and then you're going to understand. That was the best Larry David impression I've
[12215.18s -> 12232.07s]  ever heard. It wasn't really an impression. It was a noise. It was a sound effect. Oh, that,
[12232.07s -> 12238.89s]  and it's so hard. The little staples sticking out of the ground is what they're, you gotta be
[12238.89s -> 12249.75s]  fucking kidding me. I was at the same exact spot. I was three, two hours ago, two hours ago. I was
[12249.75s -> 12277.91s]  right there. I'm furious right now. Fucking staple. Happy father's day. Happy father's day to all
[12277.91s -> 12285.54s]  you fathers. If there's any fathers here that includes dog dads too, by the way, that includes
[12285.54s -> 12314.31s]  dog dads. Okay. Actually last attempt. I've done this so many times that I can just do it now
[12314.31s -> 12350.87s]  without a problem. I think I can just make this jump right here. Do this thing. Look at that thing.
[12350.87s -> 12397.21s]  Watch this buddy. I was about to go risk on, but yeah. Okay. Sunk cost fallacy. I would agree with
[12397.21s -> 12406.38s]  you if I didn't get back there a second time. Me getting back to that spot a second time means I
[12406.38s -> 12423.61s]  can get back to it a third time. And now I know about the kaizo block. So I'm prepared now. This
[12423.61s -> 12429.18s]  is the hardest part of this area. I'm ready to go. Ready to rock and roll. Just do it. I've done it.
[12429.18s -> 12435.08s]  I've not fallen off of this the last four or five times I've been here. So just keep at it. Keep it
[12435.08s -> 12458.31s]  going. It didn't jump. It didn't even, it didn't jump. I just like fucking slid off. I jumped in
[12458.31s -> 12478.78s]  it just so he just didn't do it. I've made that jump five times in a row. It's like your feet,
[12478.78s -> 12490.54s]  your feet are their own physics objects. Look at this. And they like, you're a weak kid. Go back
[12490.54s -> 12510.57s]  to the favelas. I didn't fall all the way. That means we do it again. It's not that far. It's not
[12510.57s -> 12526.06s]  far. It's right there. The elephant just upset him. You can tell. That was my fault too, right?
[12538.84s -> 12546.82s]  I'm fine. Put the fucking piano music back on. Right. Scream. What's a good thing to try one
[12546.82s -> 12581.91s]  more time? SimCity SNES. That sounds kind of good. How about Bill Collins? Final Fantasy
[12581.91s -> 12589.96s]  battle themes. How about the Final Fantasy 16 battle theme? That one has been stuck in my head
[12589.96s -> 12602.23s]  for, it won't go away. It will not go away. I can't get rid of it. So I'm going to do it now. Great.
[12602.23s -> 12613.51s]  I love it. What a fake fan. Final Fantasy. I love it. Yes. I haven't played a Final Fantasy in 20
[12613.51s -> 12624.76s]  years. Hey, it's really good. I really like it. I'm looking forward to playing it. How could you
[12624.76s -> 12633.30s]  not like this? Yeah. All the Batchesters. Yeah. Oh, did y'all, sorry. Are you getting a little
[12633.30s -> 12652.25s]  pumped up right now? Is that what's happening? I'm going risk on the entire run here. I'm not
[12652.25s -> 12706.97s]  going risk off ever again. Somebody's playing the game. Oh, no, no, no. That's the industry
[12706.97s -> 12711.83s]  thing right there. I thought somebody recorded the in-game footage.
[12888.57s -> 12900.41s]  All right. Final Fantasy 16. Releasing on June 22nd for the Sony Station 5.
[12908.10s -> 12918.41s]  And you might be able to see German 985 play Final Fantasy 16 on June 22nd yourself. Oh, it's gone.
[12920.81s -> 12971.53s]  I miss it. Final Fantasy 6 battle theme. You know what? Oh, Mario Galaxy is a good one.
[12971.53s -> 12979.06s]  That's a good one. I have a major crit- You want to hear my criticism of the Mario movie?
[12979.06s -> 12991.19s]  Here it is. It's all a Mario movie. I'm going to give you a three sentence take. The Mario franchise
[12991.19s -> 13005.16s]  has so many songs that they could remix and stuff. A lot of the musical tracks of that movie are like
[13005.16s -> 13019.21s]  Take me on. Take on me. You're watching a movie. It's just you're watching a movie.
[13019.21s -> 13035.74s]  You're watching a movie. Here's a movie. All right. Let me put it on. I was waiting for this
[13036.46s -> 13045.75s]  and it was just like a licensed movie soundtrack stuff. Every time it would do a licensed like
[13045.75s -> 13051.66s]  rock song. I'm just like, I'm watching a movie. This is a movie. Hey, honey, honey, this is a movie.
[13064.86s -> 13068.70s]  Now I, I know it's a movie, but like I, it's almost like I'm being reminded that,
[13069.42s -> 13078.18s]  that I'm watching a movie. This is not the one I want. Where's the, where's the one? You know,
[13078.18s -> 13084.89s]  you know the one. This one. They could have just played this for an hour and 40 minutes in the
[13084.89s -> 13090.33s]  background the whole movie and I would have been probably happier. Don't you think so? Like this
[13090.33s -> 13106.55s]  could have just been in the background for an hour and 20 minutes. Should I gotta go?
[13106.55s -> 13187.75s]  Oh, here it comes. Here it comes. No, not yet. Oh, also, is it a shit take to say that? I don't
[13187.75s -> 13201.99s]  think Chris Pratt did a bad job. Is that, is that a shit take? Is that a shit take? I was like,
[13201.99s -> 13210.68s]  I was sitting there being like, I can't, I can't, I just, I can't, this sucks. It's all right. This
[13210.68s -> 13217.99s]  is okay. This is okay. This is fine. Yeah, I'm okay with this. I'm all right with this. It's all
[13217.99s -> 13226.15s]  right. Yeah, this is cool. Better than what I expected. Yeah, I, I thought it was, I thought
[13226.15s -> 13237.74s]  it was all right. What do you say? You've been what? You've been extra hairy lately. Um, yeah,
[13237.74s -> 13254.18s]  it's all right. All right, let's put the music back on. All right, now here it comes. I think.
[13254.82s -> 13266.33s]  Aren't you doing the be as gross as possible challenge? Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
[13267.78s -> 13287.42s]  This is the, okay, this is the one I'm talking about. Yes, it is. I'll turn it up for you. All
[13287.42s -> 13292.63s]  right, I'm turning it up for you guys. Let's just vibe out right now. What do you think? What do you
[13292.63s -> 13356.58s]  say? This time I'm getting there. You fucking beautiful. Why are you not streaming in 1080p?
[13356.58s -> 13405.42s]  Um, my computer sucks. I'm on an i3. Sorry, sorry. Hey buddy, we meet again. Oh, it's a bug. It's a
[13405.42s -> 13408.54s]  bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug.
[13408.54s -> 13413.42s]  It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's an actual bug. It's
[13413.42s -> 13424.97s]  an actual bug. It's a bug. It's a fucking bug. It's a bug. It's a bug. It's a bug in the game.
[13424.97s -> 13437.35s]  It's a bug. It just it just pushes you off. It makes you fall off. It's a bug. Is it a bug? I don't
[13437.35s -> 13443.67s]  know, dude. You've been fucked up by my whole body yards. I can't even walk over here. See what I'm
[13443.67s -> 13466.78s]  talking about? It's a bug. Do I have to use the bed? Is this intended? Oh shit. Stop. Stop. It's a
[13466.78s -> 13474.17s]  guys. It's I didn't do anything. This this this area is fucked up. I'm telling you right now this
[13474.17s -> 13485.70s]  area is fucked up. It wouldn't let me stand on it. It was just like pushing me off. See what I'm
[13485.70s -> 13504.36s]  saying? What's happening here? It won't let me land on it. You're going the wrong way. What do you
[13504.36s -> 13514.70s]  mean I'm going the wrong way? You have to jump to the cement blocks. What are you talking about?
[13514.70s -> 13523.08s]  What do you mean? You mean up here? What do you mean? I'm slowly doing a split and this looks
[13523.08s -> 13533.18s]  very painful. The gray things in front of you. Um this is gonna start to hurt. To the balloons?
[13533.18s -> 13548.52s]  Where are the balloons? What do you mean that way? I'm so confused and I can't move. I'm gonna pause
[13548.52s -> 13567.06s]  it. Jump over here? Yeah but I can't travel that far. You talking about right here or down? No.
[13567.06s -> 13576.22s]  What do you mean? You've been going the wrong way? Just the rectangles by the no down down down down
[13576.22s -> 13588.18s]  there down wait down here. I don't know. That's where I just was. I was just here in this building.
[13588.18s -> 13616.82s]  Wait what? So this is just bait? This was bait? I don't think I can move. I'm in the thriller pose.
[13616.82s -> 13672.20s]  All right. Fuck. My balloons! Okay I'm fine. Am I all right? Yeah I'm fine. Everybody relax.
[13680.02s -> 13686.84s]  I'm a tuber tonight so this is like the most tuber I've been. This is probably the most tuber I have
[13686.84s -> 13707.03s]  been in like probably two or three years. Okay I gotta get up there and jump off of that. That's
[13707.03s -> 13821.16s]  the best way to get up there. Like what I was just doing. My balloons! I gotta get down. My balloons!
[13824.92s -> 13830.20s]  What a person really needs is not a state of peace but the striving and fighting for some worthy goal.
[13831.16s -> 13839.08s]  Fuck all that. I don't even know. I don't know what they said but I'm talking about the cinder
[13839.08s -> 13886.25s]  blocks. Risk on. It did it. I actually didn't go that far. I think I can get back up there.
[13890.10s -> 13894.57s]  You jacked too hard. I went right in the middle of all of them.
[13901.34s -> 13916.30s]  Shit. I'm not upset. I'm not that far. That's not a reset moment. I'm right here. This is not that far.
[13916.30s -> 13937.90s]  All the annoying shit is done already. I'm so... This music is the only thing keeping me from
[13937.90s -> 13946.65s]  screaming. Fuck as loud as I can. It's just like all right okay a little star is flying around and
[13947.29s -> 13973.58s]  they all go like it's it's cute and okay I'm I'm fine it's cute I made it to the balloons
[13973.58s -> 13982.54s]  I'm happy no matter what happens when I was all the way down there looking up I did not think
[13982.54s -> 13990.31s]  I didn't think I was gonna get to the balloons but I wanted to I'll take that as a win you should
[13990.31s -> 14000.76s]  stream Mario Galaxy uh maybe we will that sounds like fun if I get to the balloons then I'll be
[14000.76s -> 14005.74s]  really happy like actually staying where the balloons are we're already right there we're
[14005.74s -> 14018.78s]  already back it's like as if I didn't even fall what's up next
[14057.02s -> 14061.82s]  oh there we go how's everybody doing you guys doing all right you guys doing good
[14061.82s -> 14074.58s]  I didn't ask you that today you doing all right I don't ask you that like well maybe like once a
[14074.58s -> 14102.73s]  year oh hey sunflowers are about to open it'll be an update there soon all right let's I'm pretty
[14102.73s -> 14108.22s]  much where I was before there's no reason to get angry or annoyed I really haven't even been that
[14108.22s -> 14113.62s]  angry I got angry at a system that I thought was like kaizo blocking me but it just I went the
[14113.62s -> 14131.37s]  wrong way and I was hitting invisible developer walls so that's my own fault you influenced Vinny
[14131.37s -> 14138.14s]  to check out this game because you streamed it didn't Vinny play this already wasn't Vinny
[14138.14s -> 14146.98s]  wait Vinny played this already didn't he no not yet oh you all told me you beat it you told me
[14146.98s -> 14163.06s]  Vinny beat this oh I see what's going on I get it I was explicitly told that Vinny
[14163.14s -> 14181.59s]  beat the game always scary grabbing this one I just had to go left that's so funny and I
[14181.59s -> 14196.39s]  was sitting there just just seething and just complaining I just went the wrong way what's the
[14196.39s -> 14207.53s]  best way to get up from here wait do I have to use the bed is there a way to get oh no we're
[14218.20s -> 14227.42s]  hey you tell Vinny you tell Vinny that balloon berry you tell Vinny that balloon berry is is
[14228.38s -> 14234.10s]  going for it right now he's gonna look up and he's gonna go what and I'm gonna look so cool
[14234.10s -> 14285.40s]  on Vinny's stream for like 10 seconds tell him it was wicked hard too okay oh can I go that way
[14285.40s -> 14299.30s]  if I just launch I don't think so yeah I'm good balloon berry huh balloon berry get a screenshot
[14299.30s -> 14323.74s]  quick get a screenshot I was gonna turn this you can fall off the don't tell Vinny that you
[14323.74s -> 14346.01s]  can fall off the roof it's slippery that would have sucked so bad where is this gonna go was
[14346.01s -> 14365.58s]  it worth the screenshot let me look this is gonna move where does it move to I might just put on
[14365.58s -> 14381.45s]  the final fantasy 16 battle music again is that is that weird you care uh it's gonna go that way
[14381.45s -> 14402.76s]  or that it's probably gonna go over here I'm gonna take my time because stream is getting
[14402.76s -> 14407.45s]  close to being over I mean I'm either gonna beat it or I'm just gonna get to wherever
[14407.53s -> 14433.37s]  I get to on like the thermometer going up cell caliber Vinny's watching the clip it was so
[14433.37s -> 14446.60s]  stressful Vinny spoilers don't Vinny spoilers hmm this is important because this has to keep
[14446.60s -> 14455.05s]  me going because this is uncharted territory I don't know where I am it's got to be something
[14455.05s -> 14473.90s]  really good oh my goodness that is true uh snake eater the one that goes
[14476.38s -> 14480.25s]  it was out of tune but you know what I mean then when you smoke the cigar that's a good one
[14480.89s -> 14495.00s]  that's a really good one no that's that's from five that's not from three
[14503.62s -> 14512.86s]  let's go
[14541.98s -> 14567.05s]  I just something fell
[14580.58s -> 14584.73s]  from
[14612.66s -> 14665.40s]  not gonna fool me with that bullshit that song is great blood-borne now blood-borne now blood-borne
[14665.40s -> 14686.71s]  now Ludwig's theme oh yeah I listened to I listened to this all people are so talented
[14686.71s -> 14697.64s]  isn't it interesting it's like humans are able to create so many things isn't that cool what we
[14697.64s -> 14711.46s]  are capable of doing on this fucking planet all right this is a stressful part and I'm gonna let
[14711.46s -> 14725.34s]  the because I usually just skip right to the Ludwig part what do you think did we listen to
[14725.34s -> 14731.03s]  the whole thing okay let it build let it build I that means I can't fall for six minutes all right
[14731.67s -> 14822.09s]  it's gonna get loud can I stand on that oh my god oh yes you are on my side all along my true mentor
[14822.89s -> 14831.82s]  my guiding moonlight it's not the right part of the track anything to make you cope
[14832.46s -> 14840.63s]  with what you're doing I got it wrong there's a little more I jumped the gun a little
[14887.51s -> 14942.98s]  Jesus that's why I went slow oh yes bugleberry can I walk on that what do I jump
[14942.98s -> 14956.02s]  can I walk on this here it comes
[14986.02s -> 14997.11s]  sorry I I can't hear your donation sorry oh

[15006.46s -> 15032.10s]  I completely missed it I completely missed it what the fuck no
[15043.94s -> 15074.42s]  I thought it was much further and I had I was holding shift
[15074.42s -> 15100.70s]  and that I oh one more oh it's so far at least I did it to the music I you know what it was it was
[15100.70s -> 15106.65s]  the perspective when running up I thought it was much further that's just a regular jump but
[15106.65s -> 15113.80s]  honestly a regular jump probably would have gone over to a regular jump would have probably gone
[15113.80s -> 15127.91s]  over to that's like a jump I don't know it's deceiving damn it oh I'm all right with that
[15128.55s -> 15137.66s]  a few spider verse jumped shit you're so red right now because I'm just like all that energy
[15137.66s -> 15147.67s]  just like expelled all right yeah no I think that's a place to call it I don't know if I'll
[15147.67s -> 15156.55s]  reliably get back up there I'm okay with that that was fun though that's a really fun game
