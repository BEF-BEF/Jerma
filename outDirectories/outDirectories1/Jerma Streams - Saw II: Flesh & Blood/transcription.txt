[0.57s -> 6.08s]  Oh, he's early. He loves us. Just saw that.
[6.08s -> 10.78s]  Oh, then you- you're right. That's a true statement.
[10.78s -> 11.28s]  Aye.
[11.28s -> 16.94s]  I have tears in my eyes. I'm crying right now.
[16.94s -> 21.80s]  Vod watchers skip 25 minutes.
[21.80s -> 25.88s]  Uh, don't. Don't do that.
[25.88s -> 30.24s]  There's no reason for you to do that today.
[30.24s -> 33.04s]  We're not stalling today.
[33.04s -> 44.44s]  There's no chubby bunny today.
[44.44s -> 46.94s]  Enable peepoween right now.
[46.94s -> 47.94s]  No.
[47.94s -> 56.39s]  Vod watchers, don't skip. He's about to do a cinnamon challenge.
[58.54s -> 62.34s]  What, you mean the videos where I take a gigantic spoon
[62.34s -> 67.34s]  and just place the gigantic spoon of cinnamon in my mouth
[67.34s -> 71.34s]  and instantly just spit it all out all over my kitchen?
[71.34s -> 76.03s]  And I, like, foam all around my mouth while I scream?
[76.03s -> 82.26s]  No. That's not worth it. I don't want to clean my kitchen.
[82.26s -> 84.76s]  Dude, you guys don't know is when that video turns off,
[84.76s -> 88.64s]  that person has to spend the next probably three hours
[88.64s -> 91.64s]  getting every grain of cinnamon off their fucking kitchen counter.
[91.64s -> 94.64s]  And off the floor. And then they have to wash the floor.
[94.64s -> 99.30s]  And then they upload the video.
[99.30s -> 101.30s]  And if the video doesn't get enough revenue
[101.30s -> 104.60s]  for that to have been worth them destroying their kitchen,
[104.60s -> 108.10s]  they gotta up the game. They gotta up the ante again tomorrow.
[108.10s -> 116.18s]  Yo, first stream caught on time? What's your name?
[116.18s -> 119.18s]  Hey, Fanto. Thanks for the sub.
[119.18s -> 122.43s]  Oh, they're not subbed. Hey, thanks for watching.
[122.43s -> 123.93s]  Thanks for the watch.
[123.93s -> 126.43s]  Hey, thanks for the watch. I can't believe you gave me a Rolex.
[126.43s -> 129.64s]  This guy's crazy.
[129.64s -> 132.77s]  Yeah, we're gonna play Saw 2. It's been long enough.
[132.77s -> 137.16s]  I'm playing Saw 2 in the first week of Halloween.
[137.16s -> 139.46s]  Well, the only week of Halloween.
[139.46s -> 141.46s]  We're starting the week of Halloween with Saw 2
[141.46s -> 143.46s]  because I just want to get it out of the way
[143.46s -> 145.46s]  so then I don't have to look over at the chat
[145.46s -> 149.64s]  and see the next four straight days, three straight days.
[149.64s -> 153.02s]  Hey, we're Saw. We're Saw, dude.
[153.02s -> 155.02s]  You're supposed to be playing Saw right now.
[155.02s -> 157.02s]  How come he's not playing Saw? When is Saw?
[157.02s -> 158.89s]  We're doing it first.
[158.89s -> 164.89s]  Three days of Saw in a row. No.
[164.89s -> 168.64s]  I would be, I'll tell you right now, I would be shocked,
[168.64s -> 173.89s]  electrocuted even, if we play this tomorrow.
[173.89s -> 177.14s]  I have to make a prediction.
[177.14s -> 180.14s]  I feel like this is an electrocution string.
[180.14s -> 186.65s]  I'd be shocked if this turns on tomorrow, this game.
[186.65s -> 190.65s]  I would put the screen over to the game,
[190.65s -> 194.15s]  but I'm not gonna do that yet because it's flashing red
[194.15s -> 196.58s]  and it's horrible to look at.
[196.58s -> 199.08s]  I don't want to, just, it's terrible.
[199.08s -> 201.58s]  It's awful to look at, so I don't want to make you suffer.
[201.58s -> 209.92s]  Enable face cam. No, Saw 2? Why do you need that?
[209.92s -> 212.48s]  There's no scary moment in this.
[212.48s -> 215.98s]  Hey, thank you, Clore, the terrifier.
[215.98s -> 220.64s]  Five community subs, thank you.
[220.64s -> 223.14s]  Do it, do it. No, no, no.
[223.14s -> 228.87s]  Why are you playing the sequel, you fucking Looney Tune?
[228.87s -> 231.88s]  You know how much this was demanded of me
[231.88s -> 233.88s]  for the last three or four months?
[233.88s -> 247.86s]  Veto. I'm not gonna veto this.
[247.86s -> 251.87s]  Do you know how hard this game is to find?
[251.87s -> 256.92s]  This is a rare ass game.
[256.92s -> 260.92s]  I think as of right now, only one of these is for sale.
[260.92s -> 263.23s]  As of this moment right now,
[263.23s -> 268.04s]  there is one copy of Saw 2 for sale on the internet.
[268.04s -> 270.04s]  Just saying, pretty rare.
[270.04s -> 279.28s]  Look, I'm gonna warn you, this actually is horrible to look at.
[279.28s -> 300.80s]  Here it comes.
[300.80s -> 304.99s]  That's what's gonna happen.
[304.99s -> 306.99s]  I guarantee you this whole game is full
[306.99s -> 316.97s]  of glorified crossword puzzles for choice.
[316.97s -> 319.84s]  I can't look, yeah, it sucks to look at.
[319.84s -> 321.90s]  All right, you guys ready?
[321.90s -> 328.95s]  Ready to do this?
[328.95s -> 332.22s]  We're in the helmet.
[332.22s -> 335.22s]  By the way, how is it possible that Saw 2
[335.22s -> 337.66s]  looks worse than Saw 1?
[337.66s -> 339.16s]  Is that weird?
[339.16s -> 350.12s]  I'm not playing on insane mode, that's dumb.
[350.12s -> 353.12s]  Why would I ever pick insane mode for Saw 2?
[353.12s -> 356.45s]  That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
[356.45s -> 357.95s]  Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh.
[357.95s -> 365.94s]  Okay, Michael, it's me, Saw.
[365.94s -> 366.94s]  Okay, I'm gonna stop.
[366.94s -> 375.32s]  I can't abuse that today.
[375.32s -> 376.32s]  Wait, what?
[376.32s -> 379.03s]  Is that a mirror?
[379.03s -> 381.99s]  What was he looking at?
[381.99s -> 385.49s]  Why was that just a VR cam, like a third-person VR cam?
[385.49s -> 387.36s]  Oh, here it comes, shh.
[387.36s -> 414.16s]  Are we all drug addicts?
[414.16s -> 415.66s]  Your impression is better.
[415.66s -> 418.66s]  This is actually the guy that is Jigsaw.
[418.66s -> 421.73s]  Oh, I hate eyeball stuff.
[421.73s -> 424.97s]  X, X, X, tap X?
[424.97s -> 429.10s]  Tap X to stab yourself in eye?
[434.46s -> 437.61s]  Wait, I missed?
[437.61s -> 438.11s]  Wait, why?
[438.11s -> 440.86s]  He didn't even tell me what to do.
[440.86s -> 442.86s]  Oh, Campbell, Campbell, slow down, slow down, slow down.
[442.86s -> 443.86s]  Don't do that, don't do that.
[443.86s -> 445.49s]  What did I try to...
[445.49s -> 446.49s]  What did you do, Campbell?
[446.49s -> 448.49s]  Inside your eye, there's a key.
[448.49s -> 450.49s]  Oh, Campbell, Campbell, Campbell, Campbell, Campbell, Campbell, Campbell,
[450.49s -> 452.49s]  I see your stomach.
[452.49s -> 453.49s]  Oh, Campbell.
[453.49s -> 458.72s]  Oh, this is fucking disgusting.
[458.72s -> 462.50s]  Campbell, Campbell, that was just from the spirit of,
[462.50s -> 465.00s]  that was just from the spirit of Halloween.
[465.00s -> 466.50s]  Here's a shot, Campbell,
[466.50s -> 468.50s]  I swear to god, the key is in your nose.
[468.50s -> 470.30s]  Saw, please.
[470.30s -> 475.45s]  Oh, I did it.
[475.45s -> 485.50s]  That sucked.
[485.50s -> 489.84s]  Wait, do you get to play as Saw this time?
[489.84s -> 501.25s]  Imagine you get to play a song make traps. That would be so much better. I gotta turn the audio up for me
[501.25s -> 504.59s]  It's so low. It's so low
[513.80s -> 515.40s]  Come on do it
[515.40s -> 528.47s]  There I can hear it now. Alright, so we walk where do we oh, okay walk here

[537.04s -> 538.04s]  hypodermic
[538.04s -> 549.52s]  Press L1 to use it. This will restore your health. I'm walking around really casually right now. I just like the last game, right?
[551.11s -> 557.55s]  How is this one different you think now is the time to take a hard look? Yeah, that's just it eat yourself
[558.23s -> 565.00s]  escape from the basement

[607.96s -> 611.54s]  Just let me do the puzzle and then we'll get to eat. Would you get to eat somebody this game?
[611.54s -> 617.02s]  I saw the review. Oh, I get it. Okay, let's get a match
[617.02s -> 629.67s]  I saw I've read the review of saw to like the one of the reviewers was like it was really like interesting
[629.71s -> 633.71s]  It was kind of a fun game until the interactive eat the guy sequence. It was just sickening
[633.71s -> 648.88s]  So I mean we're gonna get there eventually I think oh, I got didn't know that was on him. I guessed that
[649.88s -> 657.21s]  You know have a flashlight that can be used to illuminate dark areas. Okay, cool. I actually did I didn't know that was on his chest
[657.21s -> 667.14s]  Alright, so I illuminate dark areas escape from jigsaws workshop. Hey, just as long as there's no shotgun traps
[667.14s -> 669.45s]  I could care less saw blade
[674.10s -> 680.53s]  Why can't I see that? I touch items and I can see what their use is
[680.93s -> 688.06s]  Don't get it pendulum blade. You're a psychic
[689.10s -> 696.04s]  Is that really what this is combination lock wonderful. I can't wait to do this a thousand times
[696.08s -> 707.51s]  We're gonna do one two, three four or five. All right that combination impale and impaler. That's the name
[707.51s -> 712.49s]  That's a car. This is for the first game that we did that to the first guy
[712.49s -> 724.32s]  I look for you got you say code over code Chevy Impaler. You can see but do you understand?
[725.00s -> 727.95s]  Campbell

[753.64s -> 768.68s]  Five-seven-three, I got the hey I get by brute force the first part for the last part. It's what?
[775.54s -> 776.70s]  Okay
[776.70s -> 780.22s]  What that wouldn't kill you? I don't think that would kill you
[780.22s -> 782.94s]  I'm pretty sure you could fucking not be hurt by that
[783.30s -> 795.10s]  You would probably stub your toe or bend your knee the wrong way. Wouldn't you just twist your ankle?
[795.10s -> 797.10s]  Oh, there was spikes down there
[798.77s -> 806.97s]  Imagine setting that up. Okay, if you're setting that up you can fucking fall down there and die yourself
[806.97s -> 816.47s]  Can't you if it's that easy? That'd be so horrible. Imagine putting the planks up here. Okay, just be careful
[816.47s -> 818.47s]  Don't fall flat in
[820.74s -> 822.74s]  Okay, so tap X
[825.18s -> 830.57s]  I
[830.57s -> 832.57s]  Still don't think that would hurt you that much
[834.38s -> 835.74s]  You'd get a little messed up
[835.74s -> 839.06s]  I think but I you would get maybe cut like your stomach might get cut
[839.06s -> 840.90s]  But why would you land flat on your face?
[840.94s -> 846.76s]  You would land kind of on your feet a little bit and go down to a knee you might scrape a knee or two
[847.12s -> 850.51s]  Okay, explore for an exit. I
[851.19s -> 858.92s]  Check all right with r2 l2 smash. How do I just swing it on my own?
[871.00s -> 880.41s]  I don't get to use it. Oh
[880.89s -> 892.60s]  What happened to that guy? Oh, he got killed by one of these like a hydraulic murder traps
[893.14s -> 901.47s]  He was she was just trying to get back in to watch turbo 985 stream. He just took a piss
[901.79s -> 905.37s]  Thank you. I'll take the plus twos. Thank you. Thank you
[911.70s -> 919.04s]  Alright, so what now what I get in here. Oh this way
[920.06s -> 927.56s]  Broken fence. What the fuck is that l2 r2?
[928.12s -> 937.73s]  You have to crawl around first person. Oh, that was so much more amazing if the rat came sort of biting my face in first person
[938.27s -> 941.47s]  Let me get me on a team. You know, I mean get me on the team
[941.47s -> 944.63s]  I would I would put that in I'd make sure it was in if I was like the creative director of the game
[945.05s -> 949.81s]  That sequence would go by and I'd be like no no, no, no, no that rat comes and starts biting your face
[950.09s -> 969.28s]  How did you fuck that up? Okay. Wait. Oh, there's pig face. Where are we by the way?
[971.88s -> 981.01s]  We're like outside inside outside underground above ground inside. I don't get it. Where are we? What building is this? You're in my house
[981.01s -> 987.75s]  Oh cool. That's so cool without a record of your game. Nobody will know your fate
[987.87s -> 991.51s]  Save your game by approaching the old tape recorder and pressing X
[992.43s -> 996.62s]  So what every time I get to one of these I describe the last thing that happened
[999.81s -> 1005.50s]  Okay, why not just carry it around
[1009.22s -> 1011.22s]  podcast saw
[1011.70s -> 1016.81s]  That's so dumb. All right, I got a nail in a hypodermic
[1016.81s -> 1021.18s]  I'm just gonna call it a needle cuz I don't like the word hypodermic is hard to say
[1022.22s -> 1025.53s]  Hypodermic it feels like we're that there's too many things in the word
[1025.53s -> 1035.46s]  All right, pick the lock to the door. Sure. I answer the phone. You found one of the 25 I can answer the phone
[1035.82s -> 1048.48s]  Where's phone? Okay. What the fuck is going on? What?
[1048.84s -> 1052.12s]  That's hit my face. Oh, did I did it crush my eye?
[1058.11s -> 1061.35s]  You have to actually
[1061.35s -> 1063.43s]  Like Millennium Falcon this thing
[1064.11s -> 1070.40s]  That's so stupid. I'm gonna hate that after an hour you leave him alone
[1079.88s -> 1083.40s]  His his story repeats itself his history
[1084.28s -> 1095.52s]  Repeats itself. Hey his story in history. I mean what does the game's about the last guy? I press square instead
[1105.34s -> 1112.08s]  Yeah, it does it sure does repeat itself they replaced us shotguns with
[1113.00s -> 1115.60s]  Stomach knives. That's great. Okay, cool. Let's go
[1116.64s -> 1134.39s]  Where's the phone? I fucking hate this already. I don't want to do this one
[1134.39s -> 1138.55s]  I don't want this is worse than the the this is gonna you understand that eventually
[1139.23s -> 1144.19s]  This is just the fun little tutorial. It's gonna be locks that are four miles long
[1144.55s -> 1149.53s]  The door is gonna be 40 feet wide and like 25 feet long
[1150.13s -> 1164.23s]  It's gonna be pain in the ass and you know, it it's gonna be a huge thick ass door later on for sex
[1165.27s -> 1168.26s]  What no there was a
[1172.74s -> 1185.33s]  Alright so saw to they've added you do two quick time events to stop the thing from killing you when you open the door
[1185.33s -> 1200.08s]  Okay, and who cares about the puzzle piece? This is dogshit stuff when I'm gonna watch do it again. Here we go
[1200.08s -> 1208.32s]  I don't want to do it. I just want to open the door
[1208.92s -> 1223.55s]  You may be wondering if it gets worse and they put those everywhere. Yes to both. Okay, great. Yeah, I can't wait to play it
[1224.07s -> 1231.82s]  X triangle it's square. Okay. I was gonna say there's no way that fucking kills me. Why would they kill me?
[1231.82s -> 1251.07s]  All right, squeeze wait. Hold on. There's a room with the timer. Wait, are we missing it? Where the window go?
[1251.07s -> 1254.83s]  Oh, he closed the windows on me. This is the flashlight is terrible
[1255.31s -> 1258.56s]  Why does flashlight only go one foot in front of my face?
[1258.68s -> 1275.19s]  So wouldn't I be able to see it on that wall, this is the worst flashlight I've ever seen earthquake wait
[1275.19s -> 1282.88s]  No, somebody. Hey, don't step on that. It's rigged. You're gonna fall down here. You're gonna sprain your ankle like I did
[1287.20s -> 1300.02s]  I tried to tell you and I was crushed under all that rubble run for your life
[1300.42s -> 1308.08s]  To alter your movement speed hold down our one running can save your life, but will make some events more difficult to survive
[1308.62s -> 1313.32s]  Well, I don't really need to have run for my life. Now. Do I?
[1313.96s -> 1331.87s]  Nothing chasing me at a laugh. Oh, why is it cuz it's just watch your step. Do I have to run through this door?
[1331.87s -> 1337.27s]  I have to run through and just put my elbows and wrists up and just smash through with my shoulders
[1360.87s -> 1368.94s]  Stacking the TVs like that. It's probably really hard to do that if feet the rammer
[1374.59s -> 1379.31s]  Okay, uh, you definitely have to ram this door, right?
[1381.52s -> 1385.12s]  What?
[1385.12s -> 1386.44s]  You're not
[1386.44s -> 1390.72s]  You didn't even hit me with your head. What is it? What about it? What does it want me to have him ram?
[1397.44s -> 1413.75s]  Right here. I've already seen this scene in Monty Python. I know how it ends. Oh, come on that I punch him
[1413.75s -> 1421.50s]  Oh over the elevator have him run
[1428.05s -> 1431.83s]  He saw me open that he doesn't have his eyes covered
[1446.19s -> 1448.61s]  Let me get this straight you die
[1449.37s -> 1459.03s]  Before you take a step into the fall that my front foot got in there and I died before I
[1459.57s -> 1467.54s]  Went in I don't have to do that again. Do I thank God? No, I do fuck. Okay. Well, I know to do
[1467.54s -> 1482.52s]  We'll get it immediately
[1485.66s -> 1491.42s]  Please
[1491.42s -> 1493.66s]  Stop stop
[1493.94s -> 1495.38s]  Stop

[1724.18s -> 1732.85s]  What am I even supposed to be connecting here just all of them just red to yellow
[1732.85s -> 1754.48s]  Yeah, but this is not even connected anything and the worst part is I can't switch them because it just bounces you back
[1754.96s -> 1776.72s]  This sucks. I just want to connect it. All right, so this has to be gone. Which way does this face up?
[1776.74s -> 1799.99s]  It doesn't go this way. They're magnets. I was I don't I don't how the fuck am I supposed to turn this though?

[1843.25s -> 1846.01s]  Steakums brain this sucks. This is stupid
[1846.57s -> 1849.33s]  Why did they make it even worse?
[1849.85s -> 1872.91s]  Why can I not just spin this around to connect to this? Oh my fucking god
[1873.09s -> 1937.96s]  Why why can't I just spin this I never I will never understand. All right, call me call me a psycho

[1960.46s -> 1977.92s]  I met the jigsaw killer and I let him escape his price was too high and I was too weak
[1979.08s -> 1985.37s]  Jigsaw was holding Gordon's family hostage at gunpoint shots were fired and I ran over to respond
[1985.81s -> 1988.41s]  If I hadn't been in the next building, I don't know what would have happened
[1988.93s -> 1993.77s]  We would had a shootout in Gordon's apartment then jigsaw escaped and I gave chase
[1994.76s -> 1998.08s]  Jigsaw was a short man with brown hair large blue eyes
[1998.08s -> 2004.40s]  I gave a render to the office that found me after I was released from the hellhole Whitehurst
[2005.36s -> 2009.98s]  Jigsaw trapped me there. He did horrible things to me in the end
[2009.98s -> 2016.66s]  He made me choose give up chasing him so that the others may live or continue pursuit and watch them die
[2016.82s -> 2031.34s]  I gave up the chase. Mr. Freeman. I don't know if I made the right choice found a case file. Well, let me get in there

[2186.52s -> 2207.13s]  I'm always gonna pick me guys. I don't think that would have played out a different way
[2207.13s -> 2215.31s]  I would have gone back to the checkpoint. You'd be surprised what tools can save a life
[2215.93s -> 2220.40s]  Sure, thanks for the Warcraft
[2220.72s -> 2227.80s]  2004 esque tooltips right clicking will open up your stacks in your inventory
[2228.16s -> 2234.60s]  They still have that shit down there lizard. It's been like 15 fucking years
[2234.60s -> 2244.30s]  I think people know how to tab target by now take them off. Oh, I'm looking at a window stop with the wild references
[2244.66s -> 2253.51s]  Look, it is first. Why what's going on here? You're never gonna not get wild references
[2253.51s -> 2258.33s]  It took up like five years of my entire life. I have to investigate
[2268.95s -> 2290.55s]  This guy's not doing anything. This guy's just shining a flashlight. Ooh, wait the question. Oh, well
[2290.99s -> 2296.30s]  It must be the Riddler. Well, hold on a second Batman. We're not sure about that yet
[2296.82s -> 2300.72s]  Textbook Riddler Gordon
[2300.84s -> 2307.21s]  Commissioner Gordon I could ask you to leave the crime scene. I'll take it from here. Where's to face?

[2403.12s -> 2404.72s]  Yes, it's me I
[2404.72s -> 2427.26s]  Would have loved it if it was just Batman, you know what I mean? If it was just Batman standing there silhouette from that far away
[2436.60s -> 2453.13s]  Tanktop, I don't know what's going on
[2453.57s -> 2458.10s]  What how did you even get in here you had to go to the door?
[2458.74s -> 2469.28s]  Okay, that had to have just been the girl or like my colleague somebody just followed me out and put us like a mask

[2538.57s -> 2542.48s]  Why did he just say that?
[2542.48s -> 2552.27s]  What was the point of saying the tortoise in the hair? I thought there's gonna be way longer
[2552.67s -> 2562.08s]  Try wait a little bit. Well, suddenly just here like four or five seconds later bang
[2562.96s -> 2575.60s]  That's why I waited. All right. I made it
[2577.76s -> 2597.91s]  No, okay, which we get that guy that guy's still alive. There's no prize for second place
[2603.16s -> 2606.88s]  Aka
[2637.01s -> 2639.85s]  You know what I would do in this situation I'm dead serious
[2639.85s -> 2646.84s]  I would probably just look at like the camera just be like hey, yo, dude. I'm fucking into this

[2750.84s -> 2755.52s]  You order of panes of glass and somebody has to smash them on the ground
[2756.04s -> 2757.83s]  Who was this?
[2757.83s -> 2759.62s]  AB
[2759.62s -> 2762.54s]  ABCDEFGA. It's okay. It's the letter. It's the alphabet
[2763.56s -> 2770.51s]  15 okay, so M is one just somebody screens such a screenshot. I don't care prove you deserve a second chance
[2771.79s -> 2772.99s]  SON
[2772.99s -> 2775.36s]  Okay, what's SO SON?
[2775.80s -> 2778.36s]  The password is son
[2778.80s -> 2779.80s]  SON
[2779.80s -> 2785.04s]  All right. So if the password is s son, then we have to assume
[2788.85s -> 2801.32s]  ABC so what there's no s here. Is there oh, let me count
[2801.84s -> 2804.40s]  All right, and this and L is 26
[2804.96s -> 2811.57s]  L M N O P M N M N M is 2
[2812.41s -> 2817.85s]  L M 2 L M N O P Q R S would be 7
[2818.29s -> 2820.98s]  So it's 7 2
[2821.38s -> 2823.26s]  7 2
[2823.26s -> 2837.00s]  Wait, what's it doing? Oh is 3 and it's 2 right? So it's
[2837.66s -> 2861.21s]  7 3 2 I deserve a second chance, of course
[2864.88s -> 2883.28s]  It's just not even why even have the door Ruby deserve a second chance I did prove it now give me a needle
[2883.92s -> 2888.97s]  Uh-huh. Fooled you tricky. Wait
[2889.25s -> 2891.84s]  Not this time
[2891.84s -> 2900.23s]  And almost shot him in the head. I still have a flashlight or did they take that from me?
[2900.23s -> 2918.98s]  I think they took it from me. Why would you duck? I don't know nice
[2919.48s -> 2931.66s]  How do I attack with weapon? It's not what I wanted to do. I just wasted a health pack. How do you swing?
[2932.22s -> 2936.26s]  It's not r1 not r2 not l2
[2937.66s -> 2941.51s]  triangle circle a fight

[2946.46s -> 2962.91s]  what TV's
[2964.95s -> 2968.25s]  He's talking I guess you're taking up. Oh you are
[2969.03s -> 2972.61s]  You and me. Let's go. How do you attack?
[2978.36s -> 2995.22s]  This is this is this is turn-based combat. No, it's not what's a swing. It's turn-based combat
[2995.86s -> 3000.45s]  No, it can't be it actually can't be
[3000.91s -> 3008.34s]  It's QTE based combat. The first game
[3008.84s -> 3013.68s]  was you could swing the bat and swing the melee and have a gun and
[3014.20s -> 3022.07s]  Take his life to earn back yours
[3022.55s -> 3030.75s]  Why would you?
[3030.75s -> 3036.71s]  Make it a QTE game though. This is we're supposed to revolutionize and
[3037.35s -> 3039.35s]  evolutionize our sequels
[3039.51s -> 3057.11s]  Why take combat out of the game it had to have been people that worked on this when the lead guy was like, okay
[3057.11s -> 3059.63s]  So here we are. We're gonna take combat out of the game. Oh
[3061.04s -> 3065.32s]  That's probably really fucking bad. We're gonna replace it with QTE's. Oh
[3066.30s -> 3074.16s]  Fuck. Oh fuck. This is bad. This is really bad. All right
[3074.16s -> 3080.94s]  I need to sir. We have to find a fuse search the random boxes

[3093.15s -> 3099.50s]  Beat saw one. I can't let saw to beat me that easily. What did I miss?
[3100.02s -> 3105.51s]  We're gonna give up that easily. You guys are gonna give up that easily
[3106.21s -> 3122.43s]  Check the body. Oh god. Damn it. Yeah, we were fighting for his his fuse that he had in his pocket
[3122.79s -> 3137.48s]  It's vile put it on now. I'm not vetoing where I'm gonna suffer through this for at least another 30 minutes at least
[3138.04s -> 3148.84s]  Did I pressed it right I did he's gonna torture us no, okay
[3149.20s -> 3152.88s]  This is really important for you guys to understand. I am NOT torturing you
[3152.88s -> 3160.40s]  I am torturing me and you are watching me get tortured. I'm not torturing you
[3160.84s -> 3173.25s]  I'm the one with I'm being alone. We're getting electrocuted. You're watching me get electrocuted. Okay, follow the rules

[3180.04s -> 3182.04s]  I fucked it up. Who cares?
[3182.08s -> 3196.91s]  What's the guy say follow the rules? Is it everyone gets minus one attack 30 seconds. Uh, I
[3198.00s -> 3200.28s]  Have to stop it at one of these at four
[3201.28s -> 3203.82s]  Fuck am I gonna stop the fourth digit at four?
[3204.56s -> 3206.30s]  What?
[3206.30s -> 3216.95s]  Sorry, dude, you're dead. I have they often be zero
[3217.63s -> 3221.59s]  They're all gonna be zero. Hey, it's really hard. I'm sorry
[3222.19s -> 3234.86s]  If it were you over here, you would have the same problem
[3234.98s -> 3238.42s]  I feel really bad man, but you can't be mad at me for not doing a puzzle
[3238.90s -> 3251.16s]  You would have had to do the same shit. You had to deal the same thing. Wait, what's that say? Oh

[3261.58s -> 3269.00s]  It's so dumb. Just I fucked it up. But whatever 3054. This is
[3269.80s -> 3274.79s]  Escape room, you know when you can play those escape rooms. This is what they do
[3274.91s -> 3281.08s]  This is escape room that you all pay 75 dollars each to do
[3281.32s -> 3284.80s]  They set this stuff up for you. So you can make sure you can leave
[3285.32s -> 3299.98s]  This game was probably 60 bucks when it came out. Oh shit. Okay. Oh that person tried to go in there and he died
[3302.18s -> 3304.68s]  What can I do? Oh
[3304.72s -> 3315.52s]  Hey sequence coming up. I think it's gonna be a chase sequence. I can't wait

[3410.00s -> 3412.18s]  This would be a second message on the machine

[3415.02s -> 3417.02s]  Didn't go back and delete these ones
[3417.10s -> 3423.17s]  He tried to do the thing where he calls somebody and leaves a voicemail and deletes like eight of them before he gets the perfect
[3423.17s -> 3424.29s]  one
[3424.29s -> 3458.56s]  Just waiting for one of these to be like I wait for this to be like next message next message next message

[4127.90s -> 4129.90s]  Until everybody kind of doesn't care anymore
[4138.45s -> 4143.17s]  Once you once you get over the age of like 15 16 17 18. It's more
[4143.57s -> 4146.01s]  All right, let's decorate the tree. Oh

[4221.54s -> 4227.74s]  Sorry. No, I've never broken into a bunch of people's houses and stolen items from their house. I'm not the Grinch
[4228.18s -> 4241.35s]  You call me. What's the bah humbug guy? Okay, the ballroom Scrooge right call me Scrooge not the Grinch
[4241.95s -> 4255.86s]  Scrooge is worse. Is Scrooge worse than the Grinch?
[4256.46s -> 4260.43s]  Let's break this down
[4260.43s -> 4262.27s]  Scrooge
[4262.27s -> 4272.62s]  Ebenezer Scrooge. He was like a billionaire or something and he like owned all of New York or something, right? He was a dick
[4273.96s -> 4275.72s]  What did he do? Well, I don't remember the story
[4275.72s -> 4283.19s]  I remember he was just kind of like an old guy that everybody like thought was a big Ebenezer Scrooge. What secrets are you killed people?
[4283.19s -> 4285.19s]  He killed he literally killed children
[4286.27s -> 4289.15s]  Starved children and killed them
[4291.50s -> 4293.50s]  Okay, well
[4295.27s -> 4299.87s]  Maybe stealing an iPad out of somebody's house is not as bad
[4299.87s -> 4305.67s]  I let me retract that statement. The Grinch is not worse than Scrooge. Oh wait
[4305.67s -> 4310.81s]  Didn't the Grinch like kill people too in the original story? Oh in the original story didn't the Grinch?
[4311.45s -> 4313.17s]  Didn't the Grinch like kill somebody?
[4313.17s -> 4325.36s]  No, sort of what he did something crazy. He did something bad. The Grinch ate people. He ate people. Wait a minute
[4325.40s -> 4337.45s]  Hold on back up here the Grinch ate children. No, he didn't. Why would Dr. Seuss do that?
[4337.45s -> 4345.96s]  I have guys both of these stories. I have not seen or read or heard in more than a few decades
[4346.52s -> 4352.20s]  Yes, there was the Ron Howard Grinch movie, but I only watched that movie with the Jim Carrey noises
[4352.20s -> 4359.01s]  I didn't pay attention to the story at all 15 years ago when it came up and the original cartoon I watched
[4360.09s -> 4370.05s]  20 years ago Jim Carrey fanboy. Okay, so that's a bad thing. Oh

[7766.92s -> 7773.98s]  Because they're too hot to eat and then by the time that they're not hot to eat they're too cold to enjoy
[7774.14s -> 7796.22s]  This sucks all around and press the that's the very hot. It's very very hot. Okay, keep clean around this dirty laundry
[7796.22s -> 7800.19s]  I
[7800.19s -> 7812.13s]  Stolen bit what I steal that from I stole that from somebody. I mean, it's an easy joke
[7812.13s -> 7824.62s]  It's an easy reference to make you stole that from Jim Gaffigan. I know I didn't I did not steal anything from Jim Gaffigan
[7825.06s -> 7830.72s]  He did he stole so many things from Jim Gaffigan. I didn't steal anything. Oh
[7832.67s -> 7834.67s]  That's just that's baloney
[7835.15s -> 7841.97s]  If anything, I have all my material completely not made. It's all mine
[7843.79s -> 7846.15s]  He really thinks that doesn't he?
[7846.83s -> 7854.82s]  Thank you
[7855.26s -> 7865.60s]  Who the fuck is Jim Gaffigan?
[7869.17s -> 7879.10s]  He's a senator. He's senator from I think New Hampshire or something need a gear
[7879.74s -> 7895.18s]  No, there's no gears. Who the fuck is Jim Gaffigan? Oh, I just got really really sad. Oh

[7952.50s -> 7954.50s]  Yeah, other people must have been young
[7956.48s -> 7963.18s]  It's okay, it's alright what we're here now
[7963.38s -> 7975.26s]  We're here now me and you just you and me the hell was the point of sneaking through here
[7975.42s -> 7998.50s]  Is there a valve here or something? What was the point of this? Why would they say it in 30 years? It's already cringe
[8010.18s -> 8023.27s]  Now it is quick everybody go. Oh my god, just give me a valve so I can screw the thing in
[8023.67s -> 8030.14s]  You're watching this in the shower
[8030.14s -> 8036.02s]  Okay, oh, how you doing that?
[8047.37s -> 8051.61s]  And anybody see it's probably gonna be in like the washing machine or some stupid
[8052.21s -> 8055.54s]  It is it's actually in the fucking washing machine
[8067.98s -> 8090.44s]  Borderlands joke the rats are the best part of this game so far. Okay, so just get burnt by the steam and grab the key
[8090.76s -> 8103.96s]  He's really gonna be pissed off when I gently lean my face in here not too close and it's super relaxing
[8104.44s -> 8107.26s]  He's not gonna be happy about that
[8107.58s -> 8112.02s]  Oh
[8112.02s -> 8117.34s]  Now the whole place is steam
[8123.78s -> 8124.82s]  Okay
[8124.82s -> 8130.78s]  Got the key. I'd rather boil water
[8131.54s -> 8135.51s]  Instead of like a steam joke
[8135.63s -> 8138.82s]  Like that's a steam joke
[8138.82s -> 8163.42s]  We're good. I have the key anything else you use the crutch to hook the key
[8164.10s -> 8177.26s]  Yes, you could you absolutely could do that. Well, what if you drop it?
[8177.26s -> 8179.26s]  What if you don't get it well enough, then you just dead
[8179.78s -> 8189.60s]  Hey more of this bullshit can't wait
[8204.98s -> 8209.06s]  Well, it's wish it they wishes they could live here live where
[8209.74s -> 8219.23s]  What the fuck is this?
[8219.23s -> 8229.99s]  my mouse just fell at the same time I
[8231.58s -> 8234.82s]  Hooked my mouse with my leg in it left at the same time
[8236.70s -> 8238.70s]  And I made a clicking noise
[8242.12s -> 8247.84s]  That's I don't know why that's more funny to me than anything else. That's a that's a I that's a me thing here
[8248.16s -> 8250.52s]  You guys didn't get to experience that I'm sorry you couldn't
[8251.12s -> 8272.25s]  Yes, you had to be there and the face cam on you will get the face cam
[8272.93s -> 8276.99s]  Maybe if you're good, you're gonna be good. Oh
[8290.42s -> 8295.28s]  I want I'm turning the gamma up on this thing. You know what I mean?
[8295.90s -> 8304.94s]  It's time. It's time to turn up the gamma. We sec
[8305.54s -> 8317.37s]  Turn up the gamma. How was that cheating?
[8317.85s -> 8330.61s]  All I was making my hot pocket real quick. This is way too dark. I have this something going on here
[8330.61s -> 8336.63s]  Oh my god, that's a million times better. I can actually see the puzzles now
[8338.62s -> 8343.78s]  Imagine actually being able to see instead of what it was which was this I can see the doors
[8344.38s -> 8352.70s]  Thank you. Okay, let's go
[8352.94s -> 8376.72s]  You can see too. No wonder everybody was like dude veto this. I can't see anything. Oh shit. This is wicked ugly now
[8377.24s -> 8393.19s]  This is this is way uglier now still veto. Why would I'm not veto?
[8393.19s -> 8397.54s]  It's been two and a half hours. There's no veto here. No. Oh
[8398.14s -> 8405.26s]  I am you made me play this you said play this game. I want you to pull it saw to waiting room. You remember that one
[8405.90s -> 8419.55s]  We're sorry
[8419.55s -> 8427.69s]  No, I'm not done. I'm actually enjoying this. There he is. Oh
[8430.92s -> 8432.92s]  We just had him
[8432.92s -> 8442.36s]  Key to survival lies within okay. Is it here? Is it here? Is it here for is it too?
[8443.36s -> 8447.63s]  Question mark wait box nine
[8448.33s -> 8455.88s]  Okay, five eight four two like that's it, right? Oh shit. Wait five
[8474.63s -> 8477.64s]  Same number
[8481.69s -> 8493.23s]  Same number same explosion joke, right? That's so stupid. I love it. I love it
[8493.37s -> 8512.37s]  Just don't ever click on five again. That's the explosion number. Yeah, what was it? Here we go
[8513.09s -> 8514.98s]  So
[8514.98s -> 8517.28s]  Key to survival lies within
[8517.96s -> 8520.42s]  within me
[8520.42s -> 8522.61s]  within you
[8522.61s -> 8526.26s]  Is it is it?
[8526.34s -> 8528.18s]  nine
[8528.18s -> 8531.51s]  Is it here number four?
[8531.91s -> 8552.64s]  Imagine not having infinite lives. That's just where the character dies in the story
[8552.96s -> 8562.73s]  What's the actual percentage chance of somebody actually getting through jigsaws bullshit?
[8563.05s -> 8567.64s]  This is probably the five millionth person
[8567.64s -> 8575.24s]  He's had to try do this and how much of pain in the ass it probably was for the last guy when he set up
[8575.76s -> 8582.25s]  Four miles in eight warehouses worth of traps and the guy died at five in the first room
[8582.61s -> 8586.95s]  You get to write all that other shit off on your taxes
[8608.12s -> 8615.46s]  Okay, is it the shotgun shells on my back? Is that what it is? It's one two three four five six seven eight
[8615.46s -> 8617.86s]  That's nine. There is no nine. Okay, there's a nine right here
[8618.46s -> 8648.34s]  Just the amount of people that died to this one. Okay lies within
[8648.98s -> 8650.98s]  It's not the shotgun shells
[8651.06s -> 8658.57s]  It's not five. I hope look I opened one box the first time and it didn't blow up. What box was that?
[8659.09s -> 8675.20s]  Think of this one. Okay
[8675.72s -> 8677.72s]  Which number was it? What did I open first?
[8678.20s -> 8686.40s]  It's not just in order, right? It's not one two, three, four five. It's not right
[8687.04s -> 8695.53s]  the wires, oh
[8695.85s -> 8700.49s]  Shit, you're right. Okay, that one goes to nine and then goes over here to
[8701.45s -> 8706.06s]  Here, right? This is this is one
[8720.40s -> 8726.40s]  Open the ones that yeah, but I figured it was like that's how you deactivate them to open the one where the cord was going in
[8726.84s -> 8730.34s]  Nice Elmo laugh. Oh
[8731.22s -> 8734.80s]  For some reason it was like, oh, that's like deactivate them. I don't know
[8735.28s -> 8742.56s]  But why would that deactivate them? We just it would activate them. So just don't open the ones that are not connected to the wires
[8743.36s -> 8749.24s]  There's nothing to do with how many shells I have in my back or something in me within you
[8749.24s -> 8751.72s]  No, that that don't even who cares about the writing on the wall
[8752.48s -> 8761.94s]  Okay, do not open five
[8762.68s -> 8766.27s]  Do not open
[8766.27s -> 8773.84s]  Eight's okay eight is safe eight is safe. There's no cord going in there
[8774.44s -> 8779.28s]  That one right there is wrapping around it. It's not going in there. There's no cord going into eight
[8780.50s -> 8782.50s]  Impossible, there's no cord going to eight or seven
[8782.86s -> 8791.73s]  Cuz that's going all the way over here. See it's still going it's still going that one goes all the way over
[8792.25s -> 8798.62s]  Okay, no, what cord is going into eight that one is okay. Excuse me. No cord going into seven
[8799.28s -> 8802.48s]  Thank you. Oh, I've won
[8802.96s -> 8821.68s]  That's it. That's it. Is an eight out of ten link here that took so long
[8821.68s -> 8832.38s]  Yeah, I did but what do you want to do? What is it? What is this? I'm gonna press this button
[8833.06s -> 8852.04s]  And I'm going to press this button. Well, that's unfair because I just was able to see in the last five minutes
[8852.56s -> 8874.28s]  Bring the elevator down on dude. What's the point? All right elevator?
[8874.96s -> 8877.91s]  Get it on the X
[8877.91s -> 8895.87s]  Get that pump. I'm here. I thought that was the girl
[8896.21s -> 8899.55s]  uh
[8899.55s -> 8903.01s]  What Iron Man character was that because there's no way the human could do that
[8903.59s -> 8906.28s]  That dude went through five different
[8907.76s -> 8909.76s]  Stories through the ground
[8910.00s -> 8915.76s]  Okay. All right. I'm gonna go in here
[8916.42s -> 8919.96s]  move
[8919.96s -> 8927.65s]  Please take my groceries up to the seventh floor apartment before time runs out
[8935.44s -> 8937.44s]  So funny
[8937.68s -> 8947.94s]  It was smooth that was showing off. Oh my god. Why is all the broken glass here?
[8948.46s -> 8962.49s]  What is this?
[8962.49s -> 8983.54s]  No, I have to build something. What does he want me to do? What the fuck is going on? Oh, oh
[8984.06s -> 9011.05s]  It's changing. All right. What uh, what's TV that tells me what happens? Oh, no, this doesn't okay. This one doesn't blow up though
[9011.37s -> 9019.00s]  Right. There's no gun in anybody's mouth. Just had it. I just had it. I just had it
[9019.52s -> 9035.71s]  What does that do? No, no, no, no, no change change
[9036.27s -> 9056.00s]  Jump over it. What the fuck? I you just reach over it. It already triggered. That's gonna hurt me, isn't it? No, it's not
[9056.52s -> 9064.25s]  No, wait, how do I reset? Can I reset this? Just go go. Oh
[9064.93s -> 9068.46s]  What? Oh
[9068.46s -> 9081.67s]  That one was easy
[9081.67s -> 9101.62s]  Reset Randy reset Randy. I'm down. Okay. Now we have to push this somewhere
[9102.34s -> 9107.20s]  straight through okay
[9107.84s -> 9117.57s]  Wait, let me get some of these
[9124.58s -> 9131.75s]  For the next door. I have to open it. Would you guys be able to stand this dream if that's how I talked the whole time?
[9132.03s -> 9149.81s]  Maybe a little I don't know if that's supposed to be scary, but that's that guy was not scary
[9150.33s -> 9154.62s]  Just walking over here
[9165.87s -> 9172.12s]  Okay, where's the TV that explains this? We got snake hand
[9173.99s -> 9176.43s]  snake hand knife skull
[9177.07s -> 9179.07s]  but it's actually hand and
[9181.52s -> 9184.53s]  knife and
[9184.81s -> 9192.87s]  Knife ah and and knife skull snake and
[9194.90s -> 9196.80s]  knife
[9196.80s -> 9200.08s]  skull snake knife skull
[9200.84s -> 9202.61s]  snake
[9202.61s -> 9221.45s]  Hey, cool. It's in the box a nail. Well, that was great
[9221.81s -> 9244.28s]  He's done it good again. Oh down all the drag marks. What's the dead space thing on your back?
[9244.64s -> 9252.54s]  Those are oxygen tablets and that how it works in dead space. That's your oxygen level Oh
[9260.51s -> 9267.29s]  Two tabs. All right, we got to follow the track that guy ran away wherever you went
[9267.29s -> 9276.48s]  Oh, okay. So this has to go through I need to push that thing
[9276.96s -> 9281.88s]  Where oh I gotta move that
[9282.32s -> 9294.29s]  I gotta drag that thing across the whole game. Don't I like any Zelda game?
[9294.77s -> 9298.02s]  Um
[9298.02s -> 9306.38s]  Kind of don't I don't know not really I look I love Zelda. There's a cool franchise, but no
[9306.80s -> 9308.80s]  No, not on stream
[9309.44s -> 9321.73s]  Maybe one day maybe oh eight seven six. Oh
[9323.67s -> 9324.71s]  eight
[9324.71s -> 9337.17s]  Seven six. I don't hate Zelda. Why are you guys saying? I hate Zelda play dead space
[9337.61s -> 9346.53s]  You know, I might it's really you might see dead space here this coming in the next week or two
[9346.53s -> 9349.98s]  I don't know maybe the one problem I have with dead space
[9350.46s -> 9353.80s]  Is I have already I've never played it
[9353.80s -> 9356.52s]  I maybe played like a little bit of somebody's playthrough
[9356.64s -> 9362.44s]  But I have watched somebody play through pretty much that entire game more than once. No, you know
[9363.00s -> 9378.88s]  Maybe no not not a streamer. This is years ago
[9379.58s -> 9384.95s]  You might see it possible
[9385.45s -> 9398.44s]  He's too scared to play it himself
[9398.88s -> 9402.47s]  It's a pretty scary game. Oh
[9407.62s -> 9409.62s]  VR right. Yeah, so VR
[9409.66s -> 9411.66s]  I'm gonna do VR scary games
[9413.99s -> 9423.73s]  I have two or three horror games that are VR. That'll be for one of the nights coming up this week
[9425.03s -> 9427.03s]  Probably if not tomorrow
[9427.55s -> 9448.36s]  On the next day, that's right scary VR games coming the tomorrow the next day soon
[9448.36s -> 9452.92s]  Yeah within the next two days. I was gonna do it today
[9453.44s -> 9458.21s]  The reason why I didn't do it today is because I've been very tight
[9458.77s -> 9463.26s]  Recently, I had some body work done
[9465.68s -> 9471.98s]  I've been mushed around and moved around a lot with my problem. Yeah
[9472.66s -> 9474.66s]  Yeah, I've been pretty sore over the last
[9476.26s -> 9481.04s]  Six or seven days like at least the last three days. What happened this guy's in the room now
[9481.04s -> 9483.96s]  Oh, he ran through. All right, come and get me
[9484.78s -> 9496.49s]  I'm just trying to find a good place to s this
[9496.97s -> 9524.23s]  Hit me you died to ramming Randy. Oh, why'd I lean back so fast? No, I got to checkpoint
[9524.71s -> 9539.16s]  Dying means I die and I turn the game off. I was the X there's an X on a wall somewhere
[9539.80s -> 9543.77s]  He needs to ram into
[9543.89s -> 9546.05s]  I'm gonna I guess it's like not there
[9546.65s -> 9548.42s]  About right here
[9548.42s -> 9565.93s]  Really? I'm in the wall. What the fuck he pivoted so fast
[9566.65s -> 9576.12s]  Get it. He didn't get it
[9581.53s -> 9596.44s]  fucking God
[9597.60s -> 9607.10s]  Somebody said me when somebody takes my McDonald's Oh me when somebody steals a fry out of my books. Come on
[9610.25s -> 9620.88s]  Stupid. No me when a friend asks for one of my king-size Reese's. There's only four in there man
[9620.92s -> 9625.84s]  They should be eight. They should put two on top of each other. It's not a king-size. That's barely anything
[9626.64s -> 9635.95s]  king-size
[9635.95s -> 9641.46s]  Run into the fucking wall
[9647.71s -> 9656.74s]  Come on. No, I don't want to stick my
[9670.69s -> 9682.66s]  Have to do it are you fucking kidding me? I just got dark souls, dude

[9706.17s -> 9708.37s]  real real sick of this
[9717.31s -> 9737.17s]  And him in the head I smash him in the head with this that was not a ram that was a chest bump barely
[9737.45s -> 9753.37s]  He faked you out
[9753.69s -> 9765.28s]  The idea is that he's hitting you with his head, right? That's what we're led to believe here
[9765.64s -> 9772.71s]  A Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC 1 2 3. I mean the 1 2 3 at the end actually made me read that so
[9773.01s -> 9774.77s]  It's pretty good work
[9774.77s -> 9781.34s]  I'm gonna play the tape
[9781.34s -> 9791.94s]  What does the tape say?
[9792.62s -> 9796.18s]  These people are not he's not like savable people

[9821.23s -> 9826.96s]  Break that. Oh, he was the one that was stabbed. So what the hell are you doing jigsaw fuck off?
[9828.56s -> 9847.08s]  He didn't hit the wall, can I just walk through
[9850.56s -> 9865.95s]  What I?
[9865.95s -> 9868.35s]  Can I be honest if I'm doing this right, right?
[9868.35s -> 9871.79s]  I have to try to get him to hit the door a few times the crack a few times
[9872.07s -> 9877.56s]  This is in a situation where like I can't read the analog clock, right?
[9877.88s -> 9881.66s]  You would tell me I would know
[9881.90s -> 9898.25s]  Let's get the abridged version, please. I got one. Oh
[9910.64s -> 9917.62s]  my god
[9917.62s -> 9929.02s]  Why can you do that? Why can you do that? That's not fair
[9929.44s -> 9959.50s]  You have to make him run into the mattress. No, you he already ran to the mattress like four times. Just do the skip
[9961.78s -> 9975.83s]  Hey, how's your Halloween week going so far? Hopefully good damn it. I tried to time it
[9975.83s -> 9980.77s]  I actually did time it pretty well to the end of the cutscene move
[9981.77s -> 9998.22s]  Circle the other way at this bitch. I can't move right now. He's still running. I can hear him
[9998.50s -> 10010.28s]  Okay, he hit me and the wall
[10010.40s -> 10037.00s]  Who got it easy? Oh my god
[10037.72s -> 10051.98s]  First scary part of the game was right there. You can't use Wilhelm for every scream
[10052.42s -> 10071.62s]  Yep, you can if you don't pay for any others. You got a new link me one sec
[10071.62s -> 10074.50s]  Let me get through the balance beam section sure thing. I'll open that up, dude
[10074.98s -> 10101.38s]  Okay, but why this why is this a big deal and it's too dark and this is so dark
[10101.38s -> 10103.18s]  I'm gonna turn the game up. It's ugly now
[10103.18s -> 10110.45s]  Yeah, take a take a selfie of your face in the dark with the flash on
[10110.97s -> 10114.56s]  Look at it, and you tell me what you think
[10115.16s -> 10127.34s]  What how did you click the wrong one? Why are you guys linking a picture of my like bulbous ass? I don't understand
[10127.34s -> 10145.49s]  I mean, it's definitely photoshopped. I'm I got I do have a big ass, but it's
[10146.05s -> 10157.64s]  Absolutely, I think that's photoshopped. I don't think that's real not at first try
[10158.16s -> 10174.36s]  There are no it's probably like do I really need to prove it?
[10174.92s -> 10178.32s]  It's probably four or five hundred thousand
[10180.20s -> 10192.80s]  Images of a screenshot of me my ass or something. I'm sure it is. Where are they? I don't know
[10192.80s -> 10197.93s]  I don't look up pictures of my own body parts
[10197.93s -> 10201.21s]  Well, do you think I'm gonna tell you I know where these are? I know they exist
[10201.65s -> 10209.64s]  I don't type in Jerma ass Jerma's ass like Jerma's balls. Like I don't type. Why would I type that in?
[10209.64s -> 10215.22s]  I know what they look like. I have them. I have they I own those things. I can look in a mirror
[10215.22s -> 10216.76s]  I don't need to look up my own ass on Google
[10216.76s -> 10230.84s]  I know what it looks like and I can look at it naked in the mirror. What's the code code bullshit?
[10230.84s -> 10240.60s]  All right, did I miss something? We're see code
[10241.12s -> 10251.67s]  Oh
[10251.67s -> 10264.50s]  What's that not air? Oh
[10266.81s -> 10274.65s]  I need a code, please. Oh, yeah, I promise. This is not the first saw game
[10274.65s -> 10286.41s]  Those you guys that are asking wait, ooh, all right. That's weird. It looks very similar. I know oh
[10289.20s -> 10292.08s]  There it is. Oh, it is
[10293.90s -> 10300.61s]  zero eight seven saw noose
[10302.17s -> 10322.90s]  Hatchet whatever that means saw but what number does that mean? I think that actually that is supposed to be a number
[10322.90s -> 10352.86s]  That's yeah, that's zero at zero something seven or be three three zero seven zero eight seven
[10352.86s -> 10381.27s]  So yeah, I had it right. Wait, where the fuck is that thing? I had it right didn't I? Oh eight seven
[10381.27s -> 10413.62s]  No, it was eight. Oh seven one. Oh seven eight. Yeah, it's eight. Oh seven then was it a was it a six Oh six seven
[10413.94s -> 10428.64s]  But how would the news the news has to be a zero, right? That's not how the puzzle works
[10428.64s -> 10441.54s]  Oh six seven. Well look at four numbers inside the room that was there
[10441.62s -> 10454.96s]  It was symbols on the walls in the room eight six seven. We might be overthinking this
[10455.08s -> 10466.90s]  All right. Wait, there was there was something on the wall where I was look for numbers related to the symbols
[10467.24s -> 10469.92s]  Yes, yeah
[10469.92s -> 10473.24s]  Six two one. Oh my god, please. All right that person if that's not right
[10473.24s -> 10480.64s]  I want that person timed up for five minutes. We'll see we'll see you get to stick around
[10481.24s -> 10488.03s]  You're about to get a five minute timeout. You're out. See you later
[10489.40s -> 10494.36s]  815 all right time that person out too for five minutes. I'm not kidding you. Yeah, come on. You hold up the stream. Oh
[10496.01s -> 10522.29s]  That person got VIP that person five minutes. All right. Now we can push this thing modem
[10524.52s -> 10527.04s]  11,000 people here. Holy shit. I'm just realizing that now. Hi
[10527.72s -> 10529.18s]  What's up?
[10529.18s -> 10548.76s]  Going on. I've been good. I was eight one five, right?
[10548.76s -> 10551.64s]  So it had to been something like on the wall that corresponded
[10552.44s -> 10555.28s]  With the symbols and that person has a walkthrough up
[10555.68s -> 10561.48s]  Because they're so desperately trying to make sure that I don't stay in the same area for like 40 minutes straight that they hope
[10561.48s -> 10574.64s]  That they're the one guy just putting solutions in the chat and I get it. I actually I appreciate it. What hurt me
[10574.96s -> 10584.80s]  All right going down. Let's get this thing that saved a lady. That's been trapped in that box
[10585.44s -> 10594.19s]  Everything's good. I happen to catch a stream of you playing a game. That was my favorite when I was young
[10594.67s -> 10598.26s]  When you were 10
[10598.26s -> 10605.73s]  Wait, you played saw the video game where people get like they're like heads cut off and like their bodies like maimed when you were 10
[10605.73s -> 10611.36s]  I
[10611.36s -> 10621.43s]  Didn't do that. Do you guys have experience with the M rated kind of R rated stuff before you were like 15 14 13?
[10621.43s -> 10623.19s]  I kind of I didn't
[10623.19s -> 10627.06s]  I was like 12 13 14. I don't think I did
[10627.64s -> 10637.44s]  Maybe like maybe maybe like 14 13 14 15 like I caught an R rated movie
[10637.44s -> 10641.00s]  I was like, oh, I snuck it. I found a way to sneak it
[10641.56s -> 10660.14s]  But I mean after like 15 it didn't matter anymore. I don't think I played Silent Hill when I was seven
[10664.33s -> 10666.01s]  What did you think?
[10666.01s -> 10668.96s]  You know, what did you think?
[10670.36s -> 10675.66s]  The whole thing let's fight you must have been terrified
[10676.22s -> 10692.68s]  Hold on. I guess I'm trying to the pocket turn power off. I feel like sevens a little young for that
[10693.32s -> 10696.24s]  Wow, very I would say very young for that
[10696.88s -> 10705.64s]  That's a being a wimp. I
[10707.68s -> 10713.28s]  Don't I I don't think I would want to be seven years old and see like the godfather
[10713.32s -> 10718.34s]  I don't think that what I would probably be like what's happening. Why is people killing each other?
[10719.06s -> 10739.78s]  Where's that guy's exploded? I don't think I'd want to see that my brother watched the exorcist when he was six. I
[10743.64s -> 10746.96s]  Feel like that would just really mess up your little child brain
[10747.48s -> 10761.05s]  For months potentially years. Are you telling me you can't I mean you talk about Barney the dinosaur and the wiggles
[10761.81s -> 10763.83s]  to
[10763.83s -> 10767.75s]  People being like having their heads exploded and eaten and like swears and stuff
[10767.75s -> 10771.15s]  I don't think you'd I wouldn't be able to handle that don't freak me the fuck out
[10771.35s -> 10792.84s]  Is that the guy that I've let out the beginning that the guy that got out free?
[10793.36s -> 10804.04s]  Well, there are consequences here. That guy's still here. Wait, can I open that?
[10812.43s -> 10822.74s]  Whatever don't even care. It's kind of spooky. Oh
[10825.69s -> 10838.35s]  I wonder if they're gonna move positions. Oh, it's just we just have to go stand in the corner. You mentioned Silent Hill
[10839.11s -> 10842.50s]  Okay, that's
[10842.66s -> 10844.66s]  nine three eight
[10845.22s -> 10861.94s]  Anything else there's just nine three eight. Mm-hmm. Fuck. I thought I messed it up
[10862.76s -> 10889.42s]  Game fucking stinks. Oh, there we go. Choose the next one, please. I really wish that that would kind of come back
[10889.94s -> 10895.65s]  Let's say sucks a lot of this sucks. This sucks. This fucking stinks
[10895.97s -> 10899.81s]  This stinks is better like that. I think that I would want to see that word used more
[10900.57s -> 10905.55s]  Like it's underused
[10905.55s -> 10911.12s]  Okay. What was it?
[10912.48s -> 10924.83s]  935 I don't remember nine three eight. Hey camera. Okay. Hold on. We have

[11057.88s -> 11080.84s]  Alright, that was pretty long. Can't break it. I'm going there. If you said sly Cooper sucked
[11080.88s -> 11086.57s]  I would just sub just to unsub

[11603.38s -> 11612.76s]  You're the one in the box lady. That's not a good bargaining chip to say fuck you to the person
[11612.76s -> 11619.67s]  That's the only hope you have if I get choice between you and the puppy
[11619.67s -> 11636.99s]  I'm saving the puppy just want to let you know and I go down. Okay that hurt I guess

[11755.83s -> 11773.06s]  You're fine. Just hold on a minute. There it is
[11773.58s -> 11792.84s]  What just hold on hold your breath the average human can hold their breath for 60 seconds. I got you
[11793.30s -> 11807.04s]  You're good. Why is it? No, I don't I don't understand. Well, I can't press any buttons. You're doing great
[11807.72s -> 11814.33s]  You have to line them up at the same time. I haven't I've done that like three times now. You're doing really good
[11814.37s -> 11816.37s]  Holy shit, we got a Navy SEAL here
[11826.92s -> 11830.84s]  I'm doing this obviously completely wrong. Well, I'm just hold it there. I can't though. I
[11838.27s -> 11840.27s]  Don't I believe what am I supposed to do?
[11841.88s -> 11843.88s]  Sink them I already did that
[11844.20s -> 11856.70s]  It lined up and the thing could go right down the middle. You're still alright
[11857.10s -> 11864.58s]  They all have to be just going this at the same time
[11864.58s -> 11872.41s]  I was I thought it was they all to line up right in the middle so that the water can just go through
[11873.01s -> 11891.88s]  But I didn't I do that already on the second one it would lined up correctly needs to be perfect. Oh, okay
[11891.88s -> 11909.91s]  That's stupid. Nothing's perfect. Here we go. All right
[11910.47s -> 11923.81s]  Nothing's perfect almost a little more
[11924.33s -> 11933.87s]  All right. Nothing's perfect done. I did that last time. I'm mad about that
[11933.87s -> 11936.79s]  I did that last time and it didn't work and I was like, well, this doesn't make any sense
[11936.79s -> 11938.79s]  But if the price of the different, uh
[11945.92s -> 11972.72s]  Got it. You got you can hold your breath. We have time when you start holding your breath. Fuck
[11975.92s -> 11976.92s]  No
[11976.92s -> 11979.40s]  No, she's gonna drown
[11979.40s -> 11984.02s]  Just the bottom was not even eyes off to
[11985.02s -> 11994.31s]  We have time we have time. We have time. Come on. That's it. What?
[12013.57s -> 12035.00s]  Fucking dead why
[12035.68s -> 12037.24s]  why
[12037.24s -> 12049.24s]  Line them up. So they all go and they all line up at the right point at the same time. She's drowning
[12050.08s -> 12081.12s]  Scary shit, isn't it? What's the game have that's too high? I'm getting it this time. I'm doing it
[12081.16s -> 12100.22s]  I'm swear to God what that doesn't count. I have to let it go. Okay, go go go go go go go go go go go go go go
[12100.22s -> 12125.78s]  Go go go go go go go go go go time time got plenty time now. Wait, we're good. I hold on easy. Okay, hold on. Oh
[12135.31s -> 12139.45s]  Get the fuck out of get the fuck out of get the fuck out of get the fuck out of here
[12139.99s -> 12149.01s]  You know your name
[12158.89s -> 12172.08s]  He was and what you did to him you're a monster these slippers are really comfortable by the way and we're in the whole time
[12174.08s -> 12201.56s]  You broke him I did just save her life. That's true. Oh, yeah, I'm not done. I'm not done with you. I said I'm ah
[12202.20s -> 12218.41s]  Come on. Oh, they trap you in here. She leaves saw two
[12218.97s -> 12223.05s]  So after saw two they didn't make another game
[12223.49s -> 12228.61s]  Five more movies came out but nope, they weren't gonna keep up with this
[12229.17s -> 12230.57s]  No way
[12230.57s -> 12256.01s]  There's seven of these eight of these. I wonder why I don't know weird
[12256.01s -> 12262.23s]  It seems bizarre that they wouldn't make another one means the first ones were
[12263.18s -> 12264.90s]  so good
[12264.90s -> 12284.94s]  Bizarre, I think one to end this on a high note. Fuck. Oh
[12285.62s -> 12293.66s]  No, this TV fell down. He can't berate me back. Ooh
[12308.23s -> 12317.08s]  There it is wait take it out the puzzle in record time
[12317.60s -> 12336.97s]  You know, this game would have actually been really good if you have to make choices and kill somebody and keep somebody else alive
[12337.33s -> 12344.62s]  We could have at least made choices
[12344.86s -> 12351.22s]  Rather than just do another light puzzle to save this guy or he's gonna get squished
[12351.70s -> 12364.12s]  Okay, I need a lever and I need
[12364.40s -> 12377.59s]  Dig so you suck at making stuff. There's a house with a wall with a dad at the bottom of the city
[12378.15s -> 12393.66s]  All right, find the lever find the acid plating area. This open none of these are open lever
[12394.30s -> 12407.74s]  Build my elevator. Well, it's obviously not here. Can't go in there shipping and receiving
[12408.50s -> 12415.72s]  Big so what the fuck do you want me to do here? I watched a door open. Did I
[12416.32s -> 12423.38s]  Sure, I was looking away from the video game. I might have been looking away from the video game at that moment
[12423.90s -> 12435.75s]  Alright, let's go. Oh, did I accidentally just not die from whatever that was circuit? Oh
[12449.54s -> 12464.42s]  It's got to come from up doesn't it sick. Okay. Now we got to get yellow has to be this way
[12464.98s -> 12468.02s]  Has to be this way
[12468.02s -> 12494.97s]  Way, what'd you do that for? What the fuck? What just happened dumb fuck this is wrong. All right, hold on
[12494.97s -> 12500.37s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, it has to come from up and down
[12500.93s -> 12512.12s]  So therefore it has to go like this or this has to so we're gonna say
[12512.64s -> 12524.81s]  Kill this and this over here and then that goes like this and this is wrong again. It's wrong again
[12526.61s -> 12546.32s]  Okay, it's wrong again. I okay. I did it. I did it very very very well
[12556.70s -> 12571.08s]  Accidental, all right, find the lever
[12571.24s -> 12574.22s]  I
[12574.22s -> 12576.06s]  Needs in your chat
[12576.06s -> 12583.46s]  Not a joke Kanye's here. What's up? What's going on Kanye? What's up?
[12584.06s -> 12590.58s]  You're gonna tweet out the screen
[12590.70s -> 12593.07s]  Imagine that's easy
[12593.35s -> 12600.52s]  Alright, it's just Kanye holding a picture up that says like a reddit AMA time stamp on it. That says hi Jerma
[12600.88s -> 12612.54s]  All right. I got you. I got you. How do I get it? What's with acid?
[12629.69s -> 12631.69s]  The color was messed up
[12631.81s -> 12636.57s]  I thought it was the other one pink and red. They look kind of similar sometimes
[12640.65s -> 12651.00s]  Melt the chain
[12651.00s -> 12664.70s]  We're good
[12664.70s -> 12668.06s]  It's Amanda again. All right. How many times I'm gonna drop my mouse on the ground
[12668.42s -> 12673.98s]  All right. Don't accidentally turn off like the stream or something. Come on. All right, what's in here?
[12674.42s -> 12677.23s]  All right. There's the valve I need
[12677.31s -> 12685.68s]  Nothing. Okay, that's the valve up here. We've got there's no timer. So this is fine get you when I get you
[12686.08s -> 12689.92s]  Get him I'm getting him
[12704.70s -> 12710.64s]  No danger in this game besides stepping on glass and stuff
[12714.55s -> 12726.29s]  Was that all right, we have a combination lock it's probably one two three
[12726.93s -> 12740.79s]  well, let me scoot closer to you walk pick the DLT box and
[12742.12s -> 12758.69s]  That's it. Just the lock pick. Sure, but I say that I won't know definitely gonna order McDonald's. I'm gonna uber eats McDonald's
[12758.97s -> 12761.21s]  Yep, oh I think so
[12761.45s -> 12786.94s]  What did that do? Yuck. You don't yuck McDonald's here
[12787.40s -> 12798.01s]  Alright, who has the code? I went guy with the walkthrough that's sitting open that's spamming it in the chat right now
[12798.01s -> 12810.51s]  What is it? I four three and I was hoping that the last security guy just forgot to scramble it when he left
[12815.06s -> 12836.40s]  Six nine four. I'm getting flashbacks the last time I did no I'm not doing this again
[12836.40s -> 12843.92s]  I'm actually getting flashbacks the last time I played the first game. So what did that connect? What does that do? Oh,
[12851.81s -> 12857.17s]  I got over I'm going elevator
[12857.65s -> 12878.04s]  Stab I wonder if there are any celebrities that watch my stream. What do you guys think?
[12878.48s -> 12888.42s]  You think I do like Brad Pitt's here. Sometimes he's just a huge fan, but he will never be able to say that out loud
[12888.42s -> 12889.88s]  He will never say that
[12889.88s -> 12896.74s]  Brad Pitt's probably under the covers right now with a right
[12897.44s -> 12912.49s]  iPhone screen in pajamas. Okay. Well, I need a coupler. I'm just spam search every box
[12913.13s -> 12928.92s]  The door about Chuck E cheese

[12942.15s -> 12948.72s]  He's a mascot is a mascot a celebrity. Okay, would you would you say okay, would you say the?
[12949.44s -> 12956.28s]  Like the guy dressed up as the penguin or like the penguin hockey team

[12969.72s -> 12978.84s]  Darkness illuminates. Well, thanks that no it doesn't why'd you just tell me that?
[12995.84s -> 12997.84s]  apologize to mr. Cheese
[12998.52s -> 13001.18s]  No, he's a great mascot, but he's not okay
[13001.18s -> 13011.62s]  They don't Chuck E cheese does not go to the red carpet during like the Oscars or the Emmys or anything. They don't interview
[13012.50s -> 13021.71s]  Chuck E cheese to ask him what he's wearing. Oh Chuck E cheese come over here. Let's see what you're wearing today
[13022.23s -> 13024.44s]  Well, it's uh

[13042.55s -> 13047.04s]  Really? Hope I get the Emmy
[13047.04s -> 13069.67s]  This doesn't do anything
[13069.67s -> 13085.19s]  Nightwing t-shirt and cargo shorts. What about it? What is it best dressed from what?
[13085.19s -> 13087.19s]  I can tell everyone looks stunning tonight on the red carpet
[13094.96s -> 13097.12s]  Shit oh

[13106.46s -> 13114.34s]  All right, but hold on a minute. Is this like the Oscars or is this like the Nickelodeon Teen Choice Awards?
[13114.86s -> 13129.72s]  This dude's awesome. He just done. Okay. Oh, what a celebrity, huh?
[13130.04s -> 13135.46s]  This dude like I went when like half of your press like doesn't even give a shit that you're on the red carpet
[13135.50s -> 13139.24s]  He's just guessing where that photo is. He doesn't even care
[13139.64s -> 13142.78s]  He's happier to be on the other guy's camera
[13142.82s -> 13149.94s]  You bet your ass this guy's gonna put his face right in and focus the fuck out of that camera when like ariana grande walks
[13149.94s -> 13164.90s]  By not for Chuck E cheese apparently. This is a staged photo
[13165.30s -> 13171.67s]  This is in front of this is in front of a backdrop. This is a backdrop. There's a backdrop. It's not a real carpet
[13171.67s -> 13182.04s]  This is a backdrop. No, it's not real. There's a backdrop here
[13182.64s -> 13196.02s]  Anyways, yeah, I'm okay. Sure. Have you ever been invited to a red carpet thing?
[13196.36s -> 13200.77s]  No, because last time I ate as many hors d'oeuvres as I could
[13200.93s -> 13207.85s]  I was really really hungry. I hadn't eaten all day and there was somebody walking around with like the free shit of food
[13207.85s -> 13211.21s]  There are clams. Oh, wow. I'll take bacon-wrapped scallops
[13211.21s -> 13216.60s]  I just ate a ton of them and then after that I never got invited back to anything else and I know that's why
[13216.60s -> 13218.36s]  I'm certain that's why
[13218.36s -> 13225.83s]  That's a saw that that that's a boomer joke
[13226.59s -> 13237.78s]  Yeah, okay. Sorry. All right, and you can't make can't make any references to anything that I

[13256.62s -> 13280.18s]  But it didn't work. I don't have a coupler. Why can I just have an infinite coupler coupler, please?

[16060.31s -> 16063.03s]  You're some sort of hero going around rescuing everybody
[16063.99s -> 16071.16s]  Do me a favor and stay out of my way. I don't care about myself. Not anymore. You get out of the sail
[16071.64s -> 16075.51s]  I'm putting you in a fuck you. I'm not going to prison

[16251.59s -> 16254.71s]  I I think that's the first time i've said snooze in four and a half hours, man
[16255.59s -> 16260.32s]  I don't think that's accurate
[16279.57s -> 16281.25s]  It's so bizarre
[16281.25s -> 16284.88s]  because
[16284.88s -> 16291.17s]  The animations are in the game. There's a swing animation. There is a you hit me animation
[16293.48s -> 16295.48s]  So why make the whole thing qte?

[16300.05s -> 16302.21s]  Had combat that wasn't qte
[16303.68s -> 16305.28s]  You're not adding anything
[16305.28s -> 16307.68s]  You're just taking away my ability to interact with the game
[16308.24s -> 16313.22s]  Remember this game jerma says this game sucks. I hate it boring. Oh my god
[16314.02s -> 16317.78s]  Cat so play something else jerma. Wait, what does that say? I want to read that

[16325.51s -> 16329.75s]  Yeah, that's you you're accurate. No, no, no, no, hold on. That's not accurate
[16330.39s -> 16333.75s]  I'm having fun playing the game. I'm not having fun playing the game
[16334.39s -> 16339.83s]  You know what I mean? I'm having fun like playing the game and hanging out. I'm not having fun playing the video game
[16340.47s -> 16345.35s]  I'm having fun playing the game here. Not the video game
[16345.99s -> 16360.74s]  There you go. It's a fun experience, but not a fun interaction. Thank you for
[16361.99s -> 16363.99s]  Literally saying the thing I wanted to say
[16364.15s -> 16384.96s]  You're in the cam on good thing. I wasn't naked
[16385.68s -> 16393.36s]  You look a greasy face
[16394.00s -> 16395.12s]  I don't
[16395.12s -> 16411.54s]  Greasy face put on a green screen to cover your nakedness

[16450.66s -> 16453.62s]  Hmm really look bad here. That's a bad feed
[16454.34s -> 16460.29s]  He was about to tell me something
[16460.29s -> 16466.13s]  Um, so what did that really do for us? I moved that
[16469.14s -> 16470.98s]  Like who fucking cares?
[16470.98s -> 16493.32s]  All right. What's the scariest vr game that's come out that I haven't played I play dread halls
[16493.40s -> 16514.55s]  I think that one's probably number one gross. All right, let me add five nights at freddy's
[16518.20s -> 16528.40s]  Easy listening what I can't wait fucking wendy's and mcdonald's, you know, sometimes just love it
[16538.37s -> 16541.32s]  You're loving it. I'm loving it
[16541.40s -> 16544.28s]  Yeah, that's true
[16547.52s -> 16568.15s]  Don't push it push push push push push push I pull this or you're normalizing being unhealthy
[16570.04s -> 16571.49s]  uh
[16571.49s -> 16573.49s]  I didn't say eat mcdonald's every day
[16576.96s -> 16578.96s]  You know, it didn't go
[16579.60s -> 16581.60s]  Eat mcdonald's every day
[16581.92s -> 16583.72s]  It's not the jingle
[16583.72s -> 16586.53s]  Just because I love it doesn't mean i'm gonna eat it every day
[16594.80s -> 16596.80s]  Have you got a funny ad campaign though?
[16606.64s -> 16610.04s]  He's trying to kill us. I'm not trying to kill anybody
[16616.36s -> 16623.86s]  Now what this is product placement not really
[16624.34s -> 16632.34s]  Oh, I can move this all the way product placement would be if the cam was on and there was a
[16633.14s -> 16635.64s]  There's like a mcdonald's wrapper
[16635.80s -> 16638.44s]  Just on the shelf behind me the whole time
[16641.56s -> 16651.68s]  All right. We'll have to go around again. Why can I not push this?
[16652.32s -> 16662.42s]  I can pull it but I can't push it. Why that's as far as it goes. That's dumb
[16677.78s -> 16678.90s]  cam on
[16678.90s -> 16687.30s]  fine
[16687.30s -> 16690.08s]  Happy am on
[16690.08s -> 16704.02s]  All right. Now we have to leave
[16704.10s -> 16712.48s]  All right, my head's gonna explode. Hold on
[16712.48s -> 16740.69s]  Why is this place on fire? What cam off? Why can I not move this shit? I can't move
[16744.12s -> 16767.51s]  Are you kidding me? This is stupid. Okay
[16768.07s -> 16773.12s]  Turn it on and now lose the shirt
[16773.88s -> 16791.64s]  Wrong website cursed link. I don't know what it is. What is it? Did that do it? Can now I push it?
[16792.12s -> 16796.18s]  It's really cursed. Well now I now I need to know
[16799.27s -> 16829.91s]  Uh, that's not even me. It's not me. Oh, no, it's not it's not me

[16872.50s -> 16879.01s]  Uh, have I hit more than three people with an axe in the whole five hours i've been playing I haven't right
[16879.49s -> 16895.00s]  There's melee weapons everywhere for no reason. It's not a single solitary reason to have melee weapons in the game
[16895.48s -> 16899.00s]  It just looks cool to hold I guess
[16899.00s -> 16910.31s]  All right, so that turned off the fire, but who really gives a shit?
[16910.87s -> 16918.61s]  What's this? It's a better link
[16924.39s -> 16926.47s]  Uh, I don't know if I'd call it better
[16934.68s -> 16947.41s]  I'd say it's a little more of the uh, wait someone's talking who's talking
[16952.39s -> 16967.80s]  Where is this guy if we missed something important? There's something cool happened
[16982.48s -> 16983.36s]  Ooh
[16983.36s -> 16989.12s]  Burnt berry, you know
[16989.12s -> 17011.75s]  What do I want to say? He was obsessed with fire 45 minutes sexy open it
[17012.31s -> 17015.17s]  Uh, yeah, yeah
[17015.17s -> 17023.09s]  At least at the very least it's not timed. We all know how much we love that shit
[17033.60s -> 17058.92s]  Okay, how am I gonna get this can't even get that one it's gonna be a split, okay
[17060.80s -> 17095.24s]  Okay, wrong. I hate this shit and don't play it. I yeah, I know you're right. I know you're right 300 people left
[17096.20s -> 17113.86s]  Well, they probably had they probably we talked about mcdonald's if we're getting mcdonald's thousand left
[17116.07s -> 17146.82s]  That's a lot that's a that's a major viewer crash why it's not going why they only come in
[17147.14s -> 17180.32s]  Two things coming out of these ones you can turn the battery. Oh my god. Why did I not even why?
[17181.62s -> 17183.62s]  That saves me so much pain
[17200.32s -> 17223.40s]  Get out of the way. Get out of my way. Get out of my way. Get out of the way. Oh my god, dude burger king
[17223.64s -> 17226.28s]  Oh burger king is here. No way
[17227.00s -> 17230.96s]  Burger king sucks. It is the worst of the three fast food restaurants
[17231.20s -> 17239.11s]  If you have a choice fuck burger king go to wendy's and mcdonald's first every time how's that for an ad?
[17247.00s -> 17251.08s]  Except they're all on the chicken nuggets and their fries are the best
[17252.48s -> 17257.76s]  And I like the way their burger tastes this single just cheeseburger. It's got like a flame broiled flavor to it, but fuck you
[17259.76s -> 17284.32s]  Very open this fries suck. No, that's that's not even real. You know, it's not real
[17284.64s -> 17291.33s]  The burger king fries are actually pretty good. All right, what did I just turn on? Sorry. We're talking about food
[17299.06s -> 17317.22s]  They're the worst. I think uh, you know, okay. The whopper is actually a decent item. It's all right
[17318.93s -> 17322.85s]  No, this one, you know burger king does have one really really good thing over everybody else
[17323.41s -> 17326.77s]  Kind of a weird thing to say but you'll know what i'm talking about if you know
[17327.78s -> 17329.78s]  Uh, they have the best lettuce
[17333.43s -> 17335.83s]  Uh, I didn't die. It didn't blow up my head
[17337.94s -> 17340.02s]  Burger king has the best lettuce on their burgers
[17342.12s -> 17344.60s]  It's crispy and crunchy and watery and like
[17345.40s -> 17349.49s]  It's the only fast food place of the big three that goes
[17350.45s -> 17356.66s]  The lettuce what about the foot lettuce?
[17357.40s -> 17361.08s]  That's that one one guy somewhere in the middle wherever they were
[17387.03s -> 17405.65s]  Yeah, just because one gross person did something gross at a restaurant what's the number 15?
[17407.30s -> 17420.95s]  A secret does burger king have a secret menu. That sounds like a secret menu item. Here comes some coughing
[17427.96s -> 17433.59s]  There
[17433.59s -> 17436.34s]  Oh
[17437.06s -> 17439.38s]  Oh, it's uh, it's it's tank girl
[17456.24s -> 17458.24s]  All right now you turn off your steam
[17458.92s -> 17464.40s]  Fuck you germana. I'm not gonna put that on stream because it's fake. I'm not gonna I'm no i'm not putting it on stream
[17468.48s -> 17470.64s]  You can have your little fantasy. I'm not putting that on stream
[17481.00s -> 17483.68s]  Oh shit, I burnt her
[17491.06s -> 17499.44s]  That didn't like it the game didn't like it, uh, what does that mean?
[17501.04s -> 17502.32s]  Okay
[17502.32s -> 17505.04s]  One omega l8 omega l, right?
[17511.09s -> 17513.97s]  Except this is a playstation 3. Oh, I have to ask a question
[17515.08s -> 17516.29s]  um
[17516.29s -> 17519.97s]  So when I turned the playstation 3 on and for a while after I turned on
[17520.93s -> 17523.91s]  I smelled plastic a hot burning plastic
[17524.85s -> 17526.85s]  Coming out of the vent in the back
[17527.01s -> 17529.64s]  What does that mean?
[17530.90s -> 17536.80s]  Did you get me out of here fuck me get yourself out
[17537.52s -> 17542.68s]  That's normal
[17542.68s -> 17544.68s]  Your ps3 is going through puberty
[17547.00s -> 17555.68s]  Oh, so it's not that one. So which one is it?
[17556.98s -> 17557.86s]  down
[17557.86s -> 17580.00s]  Smells like burger king. Okay. This might be this might sound gross, but it's kind of the reason why I don't hate burger king
[17581.16s -> 17583.16s]  Um, you guys ever use a grill?
[17583.64s -> 17586.28s]  And after you're done cooking the hamburgers on the grill
[17587.16s -> 17589.16s]  Two to three hours later
[17589.96s -> 17592.36s]  The smell that comes from that dirty grill
[17593.00s -> 17594.44s]  You know what i'm saying?
[17594.44s -> 17600.12s]  Like it it that that it's got like meat and grease all over it and cheese on the bottom and shit
[17601.35s -> 17603.35s]  And it has that that old
[17603.91s -> 17606.60s]  grilled smell
[17606.60s -> 17611.40s]  With food, you know, somebody knows what I mean. That's what burger king food smells like it does
[17612.28s -> 17616.12s]  But it smells kind of good
[17620.74s -> 17625.78s]  Clean the grill. No, i'm talking about the grill is clean. I'm talking after you use the grill
[17627.78s -> 17630.74s]  Like an hour later the smell that the grill has
[17631.38s -> 17634.90s]  Of course, I clean the grill, but you gotta wait till the coals cool off
[17634.98s -> 17638.02s]  You know what? You guys you don't clean it immediately. What do you guys forgot propane?
[17638.72s -> 17653.32s]  dorks
[17653.32s -> 17655.32s]  I'm kidding. Um guys, come on
[17655.88s -> 17656.84s]  Really?
[17656.84s -> 17663.46s]  Really? That's where you're gonna end your viewership is there I called you a dork because they use a propane grill. It's been
[17663.94s -> 17680.31s]  10 years that's the one you're going out on i'm just kidding
[17681.59s -> 17683.52s]  Charcoal tastes better though
[17683.52s -> 17688.18s]  It does I gotta get the fuck down there
[17692.07s -> 17696.77s]  Uh, I think charcoal tastes better. I'll give you the pros and cons
[17698.12s -> 17700.76s]  Charcoal is a huge pain in the ass
[17701.40s -> 17703.09s]  It's not worth it
[17703.09s -> 17706.64s]  at all
[17706.64s -> 17708.64s]  It takes so long to get ready
[17709.12s -> 17713.76s]  It takes so much time and effort. The cleanup is fucking horrible
[17714.98s -> 17716.02s]  But
[17716.02s -> 17731.04s]  I think it tastes better than propane
[17731.04s -> 17732.80s]  Am I wrong? I don't think so
[17732.80s -> 17740.45s]  I think i'm kind of wrong. Oh, some of these are fake
[17751.01s -> 17758.29s]  Uh, wait, what?
[17758.29s -> 17764.79s]  Uh, what? I have to do them one at a time
[17765.43s -> 17779.08s]  I think I have to do it one at a time. All right now red
[17780.07s -> 17802.76s]  Wait, are you gonna do it? Okay, cool. Let's do red. Turn it. Did she kill me?
[17803.32s -> 17829.78s]  What did she do? That wasn't correct. It was green. Choose wisely
[17831.33s -> 17840.18s]  Wait, wait, did I already do it? You only need to do blue. Oh
[17844.48s -> 17848.32s]  Oh, yep. That's another thing. Somebody said it another reason why I hate propane. Uh, it's a
[17849.12s -> 17850.96s]  It's a little tube
[17850.96s -> 17856.00s]  That has so much shit under pressure the thing can explode. I don't like it's got gas in there
[17856.00s -> 17857.68s]  You know how much I hate gas
[17857.68s -> 17861.80s]  I'd rather have rocks that get really hot
[17863.14s -> 17867.22s]  Than just gas stuffed in a little container. Where does it all go? How does it fit in there?
[17867.46s -> 17869.46s]  How does it not just blow the fuck up?
[17870.47s -> 17871.91s]  I know
[17871.91s -> 17879.94s]  Nope. Nope. Nope
[17879.94s -> 17881.94s]  It's safe. It doesn't matter. I'd rather have hot rocks
[17893.89s -> 17895.89s]  Taste the meat not the heat
[17895.89s -> 17901.83s]  And I like the way that like that wood charcoal
[17902.47s -> 17912.15s]  I think it adds a lot
[17912.15s -> 17915.44s]  Taste the meat
[17915.44s -> 17916.32s]  No
[17916.32s -> 17918.93s]  Put it on there until it's black
[17928.21s -> 17929.73s]  and then
[17929.73s -> 17942.95s]  Crunch it with your back teeth to try to chew through it. You guys ever cook food for anybody?
[17942.95s -> 17944.95s]  You guys have that have you got you guys have a man in the grill?
[17947.57s -> 17948.77s]  And you know
[17948.77s -> 17953.57s]  That you're just like oh my god, please for the love of all that is sacred. Let me cook this shit, right?
[17954.21s -> 17956.21s]  It's like six people here right now
[17956.74s -> 17958.74s]  It's five people here four people here
[17958.98s -> 17961.22s]  I I need this has to be good
[17962.45s -> 17964.29s]  so you cook
[17964.29s -> 17965.80s]  and
[17965.80s -> 17970.12s]  You uh, yeah, I know what i'm doing. You need help out there. No, i'm good. I'm good
[17971.54s -> 17976.98s]  Hey, what do you like medium? Oh, yeah medium. Well medium rare. I don't know. I don't know how to do any of those
[17977.38s -> 17978.90s]  But i'm gonna say yeah
[17978.90s -> 17980.98s]  To try as hard as I can to make you not throw up
[17981.70s -> 17985.62s]  I'll take medium rare. Oh, I don't know what the fuck that means
[17986.02s -> 17988.74s]  They're all gonna get cooked till uh, like black in the middle
[17990.98s -> 17992.98s]  And then when you finally take the shit off the grill
[17994.52s -> 17997.48s]  And you you go. Oh, yeah. Yeah, don't tell everybody the food's ready yet
[17999.78s -> 18002.50s]  You you take a bite out of a hamburger you make your own hamburger first
[18003.06s -> 18006.10s]  Everyone's still talking and hanging out and okay you bite in is it?
[18006.82s -> 18009.11s]  Is it purple in the middle?
[18009.11s -> 18011.11s]  and if it is
[18013.75s -> 18015.35s]  You put them all back on
[18015.35s -> 18021.25s]  Or the worst part is when somebody else comes over and they want their food
[18024.05s -> 18026.95s]  Shit
[18026.95s -> 18030.23s]  You bite yours right fucking red in the middle. They don't want that
[18031.12s -> 18035.54s]  Oh, man, he's the grill master. There he is. Jeremy the grill master. Let me take a bite of my hamburger
[18043.54s -> 18045.54s]  Pretty good. Hey, yeah
[18045.94s -> 18047.94s]  Hey, look at this guy with the grill
[18048.82s -> 18050.10s]  There he is
[18050.10s -> 18054.10s]  What you don't know is that person over the course of the next 30 minutes
[18054.92s -> 18056.92s]  Is going to take a bite
[18056.92s -> 18061.48s]  Chew it walk into your bathroom spit it into your toilet flush it come out
[18061.96s -> 18064.04s]  Spit it in maybe put it in their hand put it in their pocket and shit
[18064.44s -> 18066.44s]  And they're gonna spit it into the toilet like five times
[18067.97s -> 18071.65s]  That person is going to spit that food over the four or five bathroom trips
[18073.28s -> 18075.76s]  So they don't want you to think that the food was bad
[18076.32s -> 18098.26s]  It's true. Have you done this?
[18098.74s -> 18101.56s]  Yes
[18101.56s -> 18107.76s]  Not into the toilet though
[18108.00s -> 18110.00s]  Just go to the bathroom
[18110.32s -> 18113.35s]  You chew it up
[18113.35s -> 18118.31s]  Dude, I got okay. Somebody gave me a raw steak one time
[18120.84s -> 18123.16s]  And I was like, what the fuck am I gonna do about this?
[18129.06s -> 18130.90s]  So I took the steak
[18130.90s -> 18134.10s]  I opened up my underwear dropped it in my underwear and closed it
[18137.67s -> 18140.23s]  And then I grabbed both my hands on my belly and went
[18141.43s -> 18142.95s]  yummy
[18142.95s -> 18163.64s]  Can I please have the key in your pit? No, i'm fucking kidding
[18164.28s -> 18166.52s]  What's the objective?
[18166.52s -> 18178.20s]  Locate the warehouse
[18178.20s -> 18180.20s]  I don't what what was the point of what I was just doing?
[18183.11s -> 18186.87s]  Can't use this to save clips. Oh, we need to talk about that for a second. Don't we?
[18187.51s -> 18193.48s]  So apparently there's like a bunch. There's like a twitch dmca apocalypse upon us
[18194.58s -> 18200.96s]  Right. I just want to make sure everyone knows this
[18203.14s -> 18204.98s]  I i'm not deleting anything
[18204.98s -> 18211.59s]  I don't save vods on twitch anyways and clips if you want me to delete every single clip i've ever had on this channel
[18213.52s -> 18214.32s]  that's
[18214.40s -> 18216.40s]  Hundreds of thousands of memories
[18218.48s -> 18220.48s]  That will never be recovered
[18220.80s -> 18225.56s]  I'm not i'm not taking them down
[18225.56s -> 18229.32s]  If it comes down to it and there's like a tool I can use or if there's something I can do about it
[18230.12s -> 18233.40s]  But what you I we cannot be expected to just go delete
[18234.36s -> 18244.02s]  Five plus years worth of shit. I mean if I have a copyright now, all right, then give her delete it
[18245.49s -> 18249.01s]  I'm not gonna I that's that's too that's too stressful for me. I'm not gonna do that
[18260.66s -> 18266.02s]  Yeah, if I delete all clips I might catch a few copyright ones, but then the slap disappears forever
[18267.51s -> 18269.99s]  I'm not okay with that. Why would I be okay with that?
[18281.81s -> 18292.23s]  No idea where the fuck i'm going. I I promise I never listen to music ever
[18294.10s -> 18298.98s]  I don't I don't care about music. I don't think about music. I I never listen to music ever ever. I don't care
[18299.14s -> 18304.60s]  I don't listen to it
[18304.60s -> 18306.52s]  I promise I only listen to music
[18306.52s -> 18309.16s]  Uh in a dark room with a bright light on my face
[18309.88s -> 18315.60s]  And I make sure that no one's around I open up all my windows and look what I do any neighbors around
[18320.08s -> 18322.96s]  And I put it on at the lowest volume and I sink down
[18322.96s -> 18328.28s]  I put my fucking ear next to the thing and I hold it there. I hope nobody else fucking hears this
[18329.00s -> 18331.96s]  Don't hope nobody else hears this shit. I'm gonna be in big trouble
[18343.11s -> 18351.75s]  I'm gonna fuck this steak. Don't forget it. I told you I like what do you mean? I that doesn't make sense
[18352.39s -> 18357.83s]  Where the fuck do I go?
[18359.94s -> 18362.98s]  I'm about to rage quit the game. Oh, no, I can't I can't be here
[18363.46s -> 18390.61s]  Did you come on the tv and say hello again, uh peter is this it you're too far in
[18392.95s -> 18394.95s]  Yeah, no, that's accurate
[18394.95s -> 18407.62s]  I really am
[18407.62s -> 18409.62s]  Uh, I just got 50 dollars
[18410.24s -> 18411.78s]  5,000 bits
[18411.78s -> 18415.22s]  from espada escalada thanks to the 5,000 bits
[18416.60s -> 18418.04s]  50 bucks
[18418.04s -> 18422.68s]  Keeping clips is just another reason. You're the best streamer on the internet. Also. Here's 50 dollars for your lawsuit
[18425.38s -> 18430.20s]  I
[18430.20s -> 18435.67s]  look I
[18435.75s -> 18437.75s]  YouTube did this similar thing before
[18438.23s -> 18441.80s]  And it scared the shit out of everybody
[18441.80s -> 18448.04s]  I'm gonna wait for more info. I'm gonna wait until it's really like yeah, if you have
[18449.00s -> 18455.01s]  You're getting deleted. I want a little bit more info. I'm not removing

[18459.49s -> 18461.09s]  I'm not gonna do it
[18461.09s -> 18467.40s]  I want more info
[18467.40s -> 18470.53s]  Speaking of more info
[18470.53s -> 18472.53s]  What the fuck am I supposed to do right now?
[18472.85s -> 18491.96s]  You should switch to blender. I think the game's telling you to quit
[18495.36s -> 18496.64s]  Okay
[18496.64s -> 18503.68s]  I this is like the only way I can really go
[18504.24s -> 18509.59s]  But I can't go this way the elevator. Yeah, I can't press. I need a key for the elevator
[18509.59s -> 18523.86s]  I can't press the button burn cam on you lost another hundred viewers. Stop saying that
[18524.50s -> 18528.66s]  Don't you know that when you say that it makes me feel like it's self-conscious that people may have left the stream
[18529.62s -> 18531.94s]  Don't say that to me. Don't do that to me
[18532.66s -> 18537.75s]  The fuck do I go I can't do the elevator
[18546.56s -> 18547.44s]  Like don't don't worry
[18547.44s -> 18551.12s]  I know why they left because I've walked in a circle four times because this game
[18552.16s -> 18558.40s]  I know I get it. It's all right. Don't you don't have to a hundred people. No, I'm beside why didn't 5 000 of you leave?
[18559.04s -> 18564.69s]  Let's don't put don't go stay
[18564.69s -> 18568.85s]  Watch me continue to do the same thing over and over again expecting differently else. What is the definition?
[18571.06s -> 18574.06s]  Sanity it's down
[18585.06s -> 18596.53s]  Help me

[18634.87s -> 18636.23s]  The game's broken
[18636.23s -> 18638.32s]  It's a broken game
[18638.32s -> 18640.32s]  And I think i'm running around like an idiot
[18640.40s -> 18653.12s]  The door it's not opening
[18653.12s -> 18667.78s]  Okay, how do I die? Wait, hold on there's a hidden key behind the ladder and then you called me an idiot
[18667.78s -> 18670.34s]  But wouldn't a hidden key mean it's I don't see it
[18670.90s -> 18677.35s]  Yeah, the game is hard crashed. It's actually hard crashed
[18685.33s -> 18691.38s]  Oh

[18741.75s -> 18745.99s]  It's been five hours. I only streamed for four six hours anyways now because of my boomer back
[18746.31s -> 18754.61s]  It's a good place to take a break and get some food. This game was terrible, but I had to give it a chance
[18755.25s -> 18763.04s]  How could it be worse than the first one? I have no idea another 50 dollars from wade. Thanks wade for the 50 bucks
[18763.28s -> 18768.79s]  There's no messages. That's it
[18768.79s -> 18774.21s]  Well, I had look I had fun on the stream didn't have fun in the game that sometimes that's okay
[18774.21s -> 18780.40s]  That's a lot of fun. I can still have fun. So tomorrow

[18807.57s -> 18808.53s]  I want to be at night
[18808.61s -> 18815.57s]  Something about playing a scary game and you take off the headset and there's just a bright sun in your room now

[18919.91s -> 18925.96s]  I cannot believe it. That's worse than the omega symbol. It's the worst thing i've ever done on stream
[18925.96s -> 18934.93s]  Probably I couldn't read the fucking analog clock. I was trying so hard too. That's the worst part
[18935.01s -> 18939.81s]  I was it was so embarrassing and i'm sitting there desperately being like what is the five one?
[18946.39s -> 18951.84s]  Like you have to be making that up you have to be pretending no one can be convinced that that was not real
[18953.76s -> 18955.83s]  There's no way
[18955.83s -> 18971.06s]  It's impossible. Anyways, let's get the credits on. Thanks again everybody. Here are all the subs tonight

[19064.58s -> 19070.80s]  It's like a text-to-speech like ai bot or something. That's insane. It's absolutely insane
[19071.28s -> 19082.02s]  It's hysterical. I think he's coding. I don't think he's calling uh scammers tonight. I think he's just chilling coding
