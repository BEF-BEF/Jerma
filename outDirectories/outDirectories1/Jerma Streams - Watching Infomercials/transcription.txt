[2.30s -> 7.30s]  Let me clear it up. Let me clear it up because people are a little confused.
[7.30s -> 10.58s]  People get a little confused and that's okay. I can help.
[10.58s -> 19.08s]  I have 100% guaranteed that I would be late. I did not 100% guarantee I would be here at 420.
[22.70s -> 25.74s]  I just said 100% guaranteed. 100% I'm gonna be late.
[29.26s -> 33.50s]  I never said, what did I say, 415? I said 415 is what I'm looking at.
[33.90s -> 47.96s]  I said I 100% guarantee. Oh shit, I got logs. I'll be back in a little bit to start.
[47.96s -> 54.60s]  Definitely starting at like, at like 415 by the way. At like 415 by the way.
[57.11s -> 66.49s]  Like 100% chance. 100% chance that I'm gonna be late. Like like 415. I'll be around at like 415.
[68.92s -> 82.10s]  Yeah, it's like 415. Like 430, 415, 420, 425, 424. He's gaslighting.
[82.74s -> 87.24s]  No, I said I was gonna be like 415. Okay, let me ask you a question.
[90.71s -> 95.43s]  If on the back of the microwave food box, like let's say you have like a turkey dinner in the
[95.43s -> 102.31s]  microwave. If it's set on the back of the box, put in the microwave for like five minutes with a
[102.31s -> 112.50s]  question mark. Would you trust it? No, you wouldn't. You want, you need an exact time.
[112.50s -> 126.79s]  Saying like before time is not an exact time. I'll be back at like 415. If somebody says that,
[126.79s -> 139.61s]  that means, all right, I can't, it's gonna be like 410 to like 425. You're high on weed,
[139.61s -> 161.38s]  100% guaranteed. Where's the sponsor? We're not doing that yet. Can we get a comment of
[161.46s -> 181.86s]  your obsession with being TikTok famous? Guys, I don't own the app TikTok. I don't even know
[181.86s -> 190.47s]  if I'm on TikTok. All I know is that what I told you before, if I was on TikTok, I'd be huge.
[192.14s -> 196.22s]  People keep coming to me. Hey, Jerma, do you see like this thing? It's got like 500 million views
[196.22s -> 201.34s]  on it and it's like you. Oh, okay. But you still don't believe me when I say I would be huge if
[201.34s -> 209.53s]  I was on it. Oh, Jerma, like they dedicated like a whole entire segment to you on TikTok here. It's
[209.53s -> 215.13s]  like this big, it's got like 400,000 views. Oh, but no, I would not be, that would not be a thing
[215.13s -> 232.33s]  on there if I started. I'd go on there and I'd change the world. Okay. Okay. Imagine being,
[232.33s -> 238.98s]  having that inflated of an ego that you think that like you as an E-clown would change everything
[241.10s -> 250.31s]  if you made a TikTok account. That's, that's next level. That is stratosphere level megalomania.
[250.95s -> 267.56s]  Is he Joe? Of course it's a joke. My TikTok will change the world. This guy is a Vin Diesel
[267.56s -> 273.26s]  streamer. I kind of know what you mean by that, but at the same time I don't. I don't know why
[273.26s -> 287.30s]  I know what you mean, but I don't know what you mean at the same time. It's because you're bald.
[287.30s -> 295.91s]  I'm not at all actually, but let me, let's go over what's going to happen today. Let me first,
[295.91s -> 306.65s]  let me clear my disgusting throat before people get grossed out. Okay. So this is going to be an
[306.65s -> 310.79s]  interesting day. There's something happening on this stream that I've never done before really.
[311.67s -> 319.45s]  I'm testing to see how it works, seeing how I like it. So let's go over what's happening.
[320.63s -> 326.01s]  I've been watching a lot of infomercials. It's better than TV. As you see, I have my,
[326.01s -> 330.49s]  I've got my, you know, been on my list of, you know, how I feel about like greater than, less than.
[331.85s -> 335.21s]  I actually think that a lot of infomercials are more interesting and more entertaining than
[335.21s -> 343.10s]  television or movies. So I've been on a big kick of it. I get on a kick of watching infomercials
[344.46s -> 350.98s]  every maybe once a year or two. So I figured if I'm on the kick right now, there's so much
[350.98s -> 356.87s]  shit to dissect in these videos and in these products. I kind of want to like, well, I,
[356.87s -> 362.62s]  if it's, if I'm not going to, I'm going to watch them in bed anyways. And some of these,
[362.62s -> 371.22s]  some of these products are insane and some of them are just fun to watch. He's on a kick. Yeah.
[376.14s -> 384.62s]  AP Sensory 2.0, absolutely no fucking chance. And then after we do this, this is just something that
[384.62s -> 388.14s]  I was just like, I want to do this. I've been thinking about doing the infomercial watch,
[388.14s -> 392.86s]  like the React Andy stream for a few months now. I just didn't know when to do it.
[393.50s -> 398.92s]  But after that, we'll do this for a little while. I'm going to be playing the Serpent Rogue
[400.04s -> 407.80s]  as a sponsor stream. I played the demo. I looked it up. It's like, this looks pretty fun. I,
[408.76s -> 415.38s]  I guess I'll do it. Yeah. So what I need you guys to do is this is the first time I've ever been
[415.38s -> 421.19s]  sponsored on this stream. Besides, you know, obviously the dollhouse fucking better make me
[421.19s -> 433.67s]  look good. You know what I'm saying? It's not going to happen. No way we aren't doing that.
[433.67s -> 442.52s]  You better make me look good. But in all honesty, like I'll not mess it around. And like, this is
[442.52s -> 447.00s]  like, you know, this is, is Jeremy talking to, you know, I've never done this before.
[447.80s -> 453.22s]  So I really hope the game's fun. It does seem like it's a pretty good, fun, good experience
[453.22s -> 462.18s]  from what I played. I don't know. We'll find out. It looks cool. And I will say this again,
[462.18s -> 467.13s]  because I said it a couple of days ago, but I will reiterate it. It's Jeremy talking to you now.
[471.19s -> 474.95s]  I have been pretty selective so far with what has been presented to me.
[475.75s -> 482.15s]  So don't worry. I'm not just, this is not going to just be a, oh yeah, just I'll take anything.
[482.15s -> 485.99s]  Sure. How much are they going to, how much are they paying? Oh, yeah. Fuck yeah.
[486.95s -> 493.93s]  No, I, I've been very selective already. So this looks really fun. I'm, I'm actually interested.
[506.70s -> 512.52s]  No, what? No, no, I'm not, I don't, I, that's, I'm not going to even say out loud what you guys
[512.52s -> 519.16s]  saying. I'm not even going to say it out loud. But anyways, I want, I got a lot of infomercials
[519.16s -> 523.98s]  here. Some of these, I've seen these before and I want to go over these products with you.
[524.62s -> 527.66s]  Then by the way, some of these are like 10 to 20 years old. So
[528.87s -> 540.68s]  they may have been some new innovations since then. You need to sell these to us.
[542.84s -> 546.04s]  Guys, half these products probably don't exist anymore. What are you talking? I mean,
[546.04s -> 548.12s]  I don't think any of these exist. Some of these might not even exist.
[548.76s -> 561.08s]  You go into bed, have a good night. Hope you get a good rest. I can't sell them to you.
[562.38s -> 568.17s]  We're getting sold too in these commercials. I mean, let's literally, are you ready? Let's just go.
[568.89s -> 576.12s]  I got this, like 500 of these. I'm actually really excited. I love old infomercials.
[576.84s -> 592.89s]  All right. What do you guys, what do you think you want to start with over here? What do you think?
[592.89s -> 601.30s]  I mean, I'm on, there's like 200 videos in this playlist. So, I mean, and I know I just like
[601.30s -> 613.86s]  leaked it, but who cares? Look at this. These are kitchen appliances. Look at all these,
[613.86s -> 621.43s]  the Betty Crocker all in one basket, the miracle grill. You know what's crazy about infomercials?
[622.23s -> 634.38s]  You're on light mode. I don't know. What? He's obsessed with marketing. I'm obsessed with
[634.94s -> 643.80s]  direct marketing. Direct marketing is so, just so bizarre. It's such a bizarro world. What's wrong
[643.80s -> 653.40s]  with light mode? I can see. Do I, should I turn off light mode? This dude's a tab hoarder. Well,
[653.40s -> 658.44s]  it's not going to be bright because I'm about to, look, we're going in full screen. Look, we're fine.
[659.00s -> 665.34s]  It's fine. All right. So this is the fill and flavor direct response infomercial.
[665.34s -> 671.48s]  If you don't know what direct response is, direct response is when there is no,
[672.12s -> 677.08s]  there's no like middleman. They don't like, this is not like in Walmart. It's not in Target.
[677.08s -> 684.54s]  It's just manufacturer direct marketing to consumer. And it's always insane. Are you ready?
[684.54s -> 687.58s]  Let's just go. This is, this is the fill and flavor. I'm going to give you my thoughts. I think my
[687.58s -> 694.18s]  screen might be too big. Actually, why don't we just turn it off for each one? Can I? Let's go.
[694.18s -> 700.54s]  Okay. There we go. Fill and flavor. Do your homemade cakes look and taste the same old
[700.54s -> 706.14s]  fashioned, no filling, boring and plain? Well, not anymore. Now there's the fun-tastic fill
[706.14s -> 711.26s]  and flavor by perfect bakeware. Okay. The revolutionary cake making wonder that lets you bake,
[711.26s -> 715.98s]  fill and decorate. I've seen this one. It's so easy. Turn it up. Just pour in any cake mix. Lock
[715.98s -> 720.30s]  on the magic center insert. But hold on. First of all, let's before I know people get like,
[720.30s -> 733.91s]  stop pausing. What is this? This looks like cheese. This is Brie. What happened? Don't pause.
[734.47s -> 740.87s]  I'm going to be pausing. All right. I want you to do an experiment with me guys.
[742.06s -> 745.74s]  Every time they do a black and white, look at this person, screw something up,
[745.74s -> 753.70s]  or look at how bad this looks. Imagine the person is like 10 beers deep. This is just like the person
[753.70s -> 761.90s]  is trashed. If you think like that, it's, this makes sense. This person is shit faced and they
[761.90s -> 767.43s]  decided to make a cake. I'm telling you, all of them think that way. We'll, we'll, we'll stop it
[767.43s -> 773.19s]  each time. Boring and plain? Well, not anymore. Now there's the fun-tastic fill and flavor by
[773.19s -> 777.03s]  perfect bakeware. I remember so many of these too. The revolutionary cake making wonder that lets you
[777.03s -> 782.31s]  bake, fill and decorate. Oh, you can do, you can do it with the kids. Pour in any cake mix. Lock on
[782.31s -> 787.27s]  the magic center insert and place them in the oven. Okay. When done, remove the insert,
[787.27s -> 792.39s]  add your favorite filling, then cover it with the base. All right. Amazing. A wonderful cake. It's
[792.39s -> 798.23s]  so thrilling. It's still thrilling. Imagine their surprise when they see tasty chocolate.
[798.23s -> 804.44s]  That's a huge fucking feast. Who's, who's going to eat that? Is one of the kids going to eat this?
[804.44s -> 811.74s]  Yeah. No shit. They're surprised. It's like mom's given us the whole cake. Tasty chocolate. That's
[811.74s -> 823.46s]  so, that's so much. That's way too much. Chocolate pudding. I'd eat that. Yep. Oh, look at our shit
[823.46s -> 828.18s]  face. This person is, look at our shit face. Okay. Remember this person, it's like three o'clock in
[828.18s -> 835.45s]  the morning and they know they have a pie in the fridge and they're like two or three of them in
[835.45s -> 838.89s]  the room are like, yo pie, right dude? Oh, let's get it.
[844.65s -> 855.29s]  We had this. Did it work? Wait, hold on. Whose hands are these? What, what? Oh, I thought this
[855.29s -> 859.85s]  was a batting glove. I was like, why is, why is like a baseball player serving this? I thought
[859.85s -> 868.01s]  that was a fucking like golf glove. Yeah. I just made a few cakes for the boys in the locker room.
[875.05s -> 886.09s]  What's wrong with this one? I don't know about that one. That's actually, that's kind of cool.
[895.69s -> 904.33s]  What? That's bullshit. They don't, they won't even potentially have a center filling.
[904.65s -> 909.53s]  What could be better than one filling flavor? Two filling flavors. That's right. You get two for the
[909.53s -> 913.69s]  price of one. Two? Just pay separate processing and handling. I have a question for everybody.
[913.69s -> 919.45s]  I've had this theory since I was like 15 or 16, whatever. So when they say, oh, and if you act now,
[919.45s -> 925.51s]  you get a second one free. Almost every single infomercial that you'll see on all these lists,
[925.51s -> 933.74s]  one of these videos, they did that. And was that just your paying for two? We just say this is how
[933.74s -> 944.65s]  much it costs for one. Is that, that's how that works, right? That's, that's the idea. Oh, and
[944.65s -> 950.65s]  remember if you get our, get this, it's, you get two for just $19.99. The price is $19.99 for this,
[950.65s -> 959.90s]  but you get two. So they're $10 each, right? Has to be. I don't, it could, maybe it's not,
[959.90s -> 964.49s]  but I'm just saying like, I remember that was a, that was a big thing. Or they'd give you other
[964.49s -> 969.22s]  stuff. It was like, yeah, it's $39.99 for this. And they show all the commercial, they show everything.
[969.22s -> 972.82s]  And all of a sudden they'll be like, but hold on a second. You also get the scissors too,
[973.82s -> 982.54s]  and the swimming goggles. And it's like, wait, did you just kind of, did you just sell me three
[982.54s -> 990.39s]  things and just added all the prices together? That used to happen. This thing's kind of cool.
[990.95s -> 995.75s]  Today to order fill and flavor for $19.95 plus processing and fill and flavor.
[997.19s -> 1000.95s]  All right. Yeah. And I, okay. Well here's the thing guys, you know,
[1000.95s -> 1004.55s]  none of these fucking, don't fucking do that. I'll be an idiot.
[1005.43s -> 1009.19s]  All right. What about the clever tongs? Spatulas and tongs have been around forever,
[1009.19s -> 1014.39s]  but try to flip and food flops, try to grip shit face. I'm telling you shit face.
[1014.39s -> 1039.69s]  I imagine somebody sitting across the table, right? Like somebody sitting here and it's like,
[1040.41s -> 1043.61s]  like mom, mom, oh, they're getting like burnt.
[1050.49s -> 1056.33s]  Whoa. Actually, this is pretty cool. So it's got like a canvas.
[1062.81s -> 1063.61s]  Hammock. I got it wrong.
[1068.65s -> 1069.45s]  The clever tong.
[1073.45s -> 1077.37s]  Why would you want to hoist a whole pot roast? Like with your one hand.
[1080.09s -> 1084.01s]  Flip potato cakes fast and easy right in the pan. All right. You went. All right.
[1086.57s -> 1089.13s]  I had to use it. This is actually pretty awesome.
[1094.33s -> 1099.82s]  All right. I got a question. How many of you guys have made burgers, right?
[1099.82s -> 1104.46s]  And here's the thing about pans. You ready for this? Listen to this. This is important.
[1104.46s -> 1110.17s]  I didn't know this, but like you can't use certain utensils in certain pans.
[1110.17s -> 1114.34s]  There's like a bunch of rules that I didn't know about. Like, oh, hey, yeah, you want,
[1114.34s -> 1120.10s]  let me flip your burger with my spatula. Don't do that. Don't fucking do that.
[1120.10s -> 1125.69s]  You're going to ruin everything. I'm like, um, what about this tool? No, that'll cause damage.
[1125.69s -> 1132.22s]  You have to use this specific tool. You have to use this specific silicone to pick that up.
[1132.22s -> 1136.76s]  Okay. Oh shit. I didn't know that. And I didn't know that up until like,
[1136.76s -> 1143.19s]  I would say maybe like five years ago. I did not know that chef Andy, right?
[1143.19s -> 1151.13s]  So a product like this, I'm just going to be very honest with you. I, I, I sport it because
[1151.13s -> 1155.61s]  this just works in any pan. Nobody's going to yell at you. Mom's not going to be pissed.
[1155.61s -> 1158.73s]  You're not going to scratch anything. You're not going to be looking at how much asparagus
[1158.73s -> 1163.14s]  can fit in that, by the way. Look at how much asparagus without it falling or scoop,
[1163.14s -> 1167.78s]  lift and serve an amazing Philly cheesesteak in seconds. Clever tongs is very clever.
[1167.78s -> 1171.94s]  Two in one helper. You need to grip and flip that king sized ribeye with ease.
[1172.02s -> 1175.86s]  And by the way, guys, that was a king size ribeye, not just a regular size ribeye. That's an extra.
[1175.86s -> 1178.66s]  That's like, that's like another 70 cents for McDonald's. That's super size.
[1178.66s -> 1182.18s]  Flip and serve a mouthwatering grilled cheese. Scoop and flip delicately.
[1182.18s -> 1186.10s]  Does this still exist? I hope so. I just get it.
[1186.10s -> 1188.98s]  And then scoop and serve the potatoes with perfection.
[1190.50s -> 1194.18s]  What was this called? The clever tongs? Okay. That thing's actually fucking pretty good.
[1194.74s -> 1201.67s]  I actually like, I always, okay, even with the right tool, I will always go like this.
[1201.67s -> 1204.70s]  Everybody does this. And don't tell me you don't because it sucks.
[1204.70s -> 1209.98s]  You got a spatula and you go down, you try to get under slowly
[1209.98s -> 1214.62s]  and you end up just moving the patty to the edge of the pan.
[1214.62s -> 1218.94s]  And then you end up just like kind of taking your finger and like
[1218.94s -> 1225.26s]  touching the edge and like lifting it and then letting go.
[1225.26s -> 1231.35s]  I'm so sick of doing that because like the spatulas, even the silicone ones,
[1231.35s -> 1234.31s]  they don't get under. They kind of just like push and slide.
[1236.65s -> 1240.49s]  I think I flip half of hamburgers I've ever flipped in my life.
[1240.49s -> 1244.57s]  Unless they were on a grill because a grill like don't matter.
[1244.57s -> 1248.01s]  A grill like who cares if you're like using the right utensils.
[1248.01s -> 1250.33s]  It's just like you just take it, you fucking flip it.
[1250.33s -> 1252.17s]  You get like grease all over. It doesn't matter.
[1252.17s -> 1257.00s]  But like it sucks doing that. Target audience.
[1260.10s -> 1262.02s]  I mean, okay, I would say I would want that one.
[1265.05s -> 1267.85s]  Also back in the, we're going to just watch, this is Egg Genie.
[1269.29s -> 1270.41s]  I'll give a preference to this though.
[1270.41s -> 1274.25s]  I don't know what it was with like the mid to late 90s and like the early 2000s
[1274.25s -> 1276.73s]  and like mid 2000s with eggs in the microwave.
[1280.10s -> 1281.30s]  I don't, why?
[1281.94s -> 1288.50s]  It was a huge thing. Eggs in the microwave.
[1288.50s -> 1291.19s]  There was so many products that did it.
[1291.19s -> 1294.87s]  It was like, oh, put your egg in this and it'll turn in a minute you'll have an egg.
[1294.87s -> 1298.34s]  Eggs don't take that long though.
[1298.34s -> 1300.18s]  If you just do like scrambled egg, I mean the pan.
[1300.18s -> 1302.18s]  Yeah, maybe you mess up the pan, you get it all dirty.
[1302.18s -> 1305.22s]  But there was an obsession in like the early 2000s
[1305.22s -> 1308.34s]  with cooking eggs in the microwave with our device.
[1310.98s -> 1314.70s]  Okay, hold on. Let's see. I'm curious.
[1318.14s -> 1328.38s]  That's a poached egg and it looks great.
[1329.50s -> 1333.46s]  That looks like a really great poached egg.
[1333.46s -> 1334.10s]  What do they mean?
[1337.46s -> 1338.82s]  Isn't that a poach? That looks good.
[1338.82s -> 1340.34s]  I would eat that to put that on a piece of toast.
[1341.54s -> 1342.34s]  That's a poached egg.
[1349.70s -> 1356.10s]  Also, I'm sure a lot of people are probably noticing the Nolan North
[1356.10s -> 1359.51s]  of all infomercial voiceovers.
[1359.51s -> 1362.94s]  This guy introducing the egg wave.
[1362.94s -> 1367.32s]  This guy probably was, this guy probably made,
[1367.32s -> 1368.44s]  God damn, I don't know, man.
[1368.44s -> 1371.14s]  This guy probably made thousands of dollars an hour.
[1371.14s -> 1373.70s]  He would probably, he probably just the guy, like the guy.
[1373.70s -> 1375.62s]  He was the voice and I think he's still going.
[1380.26s -> 1381.38s]  Oh, it's not in the microwave.
[1385.94s -> 1396.74s]  Dude.
[1402.74s -> 1403.06s]  Nice.
[1405.54s -> 1407.30s]  I thought it was, all right, that's kind of cool.
[1407.30s -> 1411.30s]  I thought it was going to be a, they're fine.
[1416.02s -> 1419.62s]  But it's like a bug zapper.
[1421.94s -> 1422.90s]  Oh, don't mind that.
[1422.90s -> 1424.18s]  It's just the bugs being zapped.
[1424.82s -> 1428.18s]  Because when you turn it upside down, it's also a bug zapper indicator.
[1428.18s -> 1432.42s]  Like shut off and continuous audible signal that prevents overcooking.
[1432.42s -> 1434.90s]  Now it's a breeze to stick to your diet with quick
[1434.90s -> 1437.38s]  and easy locale snacks that always taste.
[1437.38s -> 1438.42s]  That's kind of cool.
[1438.42s -> 1441.30s]  Egg Genie also comes with its own steamer tray.
[1441.30s -> 1441.62s]  All right.
[1443.62s -> 1444.18s]  Okay.
[1444.18s -> 1444.90s]  All right.
[1444.98s -> 1445.38s]  You got me.
[1453.38s -> 1455.30s]  Wait, what are they giving us?
[1455.30s -> 1455.70s]  There it is.
[1457.22s -> 1458.18s]  The bacon wave.
[1469.62s -> 1470.10s]  All right.
[1470.10s -> 1470.50s]  All right.
[1472.65s -> 1474.17s]  Everything had to be a genie too.
[1474.17s -> 1474.41s]  Yeah.
[1476.22s -> 1476.54s]  Okay.
[1476.54s -> 1478.14s]  So let me tell you what I think about this.
[1478.14s -> 1478.94s]  I'm into it.
[1478.94s -> 1484.62s]  I thought this is going to be a microwave thing, but I, that was unfair.
[1486.97s -> 1490.01s]  It's just a steamer that has one setting probably, right?
[1490.01s -> 1494.86s]  But I mean, that's, I probably would have used this.
[1495.42s -> 1500.10s]  The thing about all these products, these kind of like direct marketing products,
[1500.10s -> 1505.30s]  the problem with a lot of them was they kind of really only did one thing.
[1505.30s -> 1512.25s]  They just did one thing and they always made a point to like,
[1512.25s -> 1516.89s]  Oh, you have so much bullshit on your counter and so much dog shit in your pantry.
[1518.18s -> 1521.06s]  This is just, this is like, it's just a steamer that has one setting.
[1521.06s -> 1525.00s]  They always made a point about this, how you had too much bullshit,
[1525.00s -> 1529.54s]  but they were just trying to sell you a product that like was, did one thing.
[1529.54s -> 1531.38s]  Although I would say I probably would have used this
[1531.38s -> 1534.34s]  because cooking hard eggs actually is a pain in the ass,
[1534.34s -> 1535.46s]  but I wouldn't want to microwave them.
[1535.46s -> 1536.42s]  Steaming them sounds pretty interesting.
[1536.42s -> 1537.30s]  I've never done that before.
[1537.30s -> 1539.32s]  That sounds good.
[1543.13s -> 1543.93s]  That's actually pretty cool.
[1544.57s -> 1545.51s]  I'm into it.
[1545.51s -> 1549.82s]  I have not seen one that I've been like, no, no, thanks.
[1549.82s -> 1550.38s]  There's a lot.
[1551.26s -> 1552.14s]  This is so much fun.
[1552.14s -> 1552.86s]  I love this.
[1552.86s -> 1554.14s]  This is like the funnest thing ever.
[1554.78s -> 1555.10s]  Okay.
[1555.66s -> 1557.72s]  How about the perfect slicer?
[1557.72s -> 1558.52s]  Slicers are weird.
[1567.56s -> 1567.88s]  All right.
[1567.88s -> 1571.00s]  First of all, I made this reference like two months ago and there it is.
[1573.00s -> 1575.56s]  That's a Gallagher reference and I'm so glad that you got to see it.
[1583.66s -> 1584.06s]  Careful.
[1584.06s -> 1595.74s]  Bro, what the fuck?
[1596.70s -> 1598.06s]  I want watermelon, dude.
[1598.06s -> 1599.18s]  Get in there.
[1599.18s -> 1600.79s]  I'm fucking trying, dude.
[1600.79s -> 1601.11s]  Sucks.
[1602.31s -> 1605.19s]  Just imagine you hear the word bro like three times in the corner.
[1606.87s -> 1607.75s]  You fucking do it.
[1607.75s -> 1613.43s]  Dude.
[1613.43s -> 1614.23s]  That thing's scary.
[1617.35s -> 1618.71s]  Just don't hold the knife like this.
[1618.71s -> 1620.23s]  It's not like a fucking lightsaber.
[1633.83s -> 1634.63s]  Cantaloupe sucks.
[1638.71s -> 1640.23s]  I kind of got hold on.
[1640.87s -> 1641.43s]  Wait a minute here.
[1643.43s -> 1646.47s]  This is kind of, I kind of got, that kind of got messed up.
[1652.31s -> 1652.55s]  What?
[1652.55s -> 1653.27s]  I don't like cantaloupe.
[1660.31s -> 1662.07s]  They should have leaned way heavier into that.
[1664.55s -> 1666.47s]  Yeah, they should have.
[1666.47s -> 1666.71s]  Yeah.
[1666.71s -> 1667.27s]  Lean into that.
[1672.39s -> 1674.39s]  120 perfect delicious slices.
[1675.11s -> 1677.27s]  Oh, I thought the guy did it 120 times.
[1683.27s -> 1686.87s]  I thought it was like we made this guy do this 150 times and he said it was easy.
[1691.27s -> 1697.72s]  Another thing I want you to pay attention to and look for here is something technology.
[1697.72s -> 1699.27s]  Keep an eye on that.
[1699.27s -> 1704.33s]  They would say like two or three words and then add technology to the end
[1704.33s -> 1708.01s]  and it was supposed to be like oh wow that's like a scientist had to have come up with that.
[1712.49s -> 1714.25s]  Advanced freshness technology.
[1715.59s -> 1717.99s]  What is advanced freshness technology?
[1717.99s -> 1721.14s]  What's the, what is the tech behind that?
[1721.14s -> 1721.78s]  Technology.
[1723.80s -> 1724.84s]  Advanced freshness.
[1727.51s -> 1727.91s]  I don't know.
[1731.43s -> 1733.03s]  I think the, I think the cutting thing is cool.
[1735.19s -> 1737.67s]  You know how many times I've actually had like a cake or something?
[1738.87s -> 1739.43s]  Go now.
[1740.15s -> 1740.95s]  Or pineapple too.
[1740.95s -> 1742.47s]  That'd be like pineapple just cut but I don't know.
[1742.47s -> 1743.83s]  I feel like I'd be kind of scared to do that.
[1743.83s -> 1745.32s]  Wouldn't you?
[1745.32s -> 1748.60s]  Going like this and like pushing because the thing might be wobbling around.
[1748.60s -> 1749.96s]  I might be kind of scared to do that.
[1749.96s -> 1754.60s]  All right.
[1754.60s -> 1756.28s]  This looks like a pretty similar realm here.
[1756.28s -> 1757.64s]  This is the Jiffy fries.
[1758.97s -> 1764.17s]  By the way, I'm so glad this is as seen on TV blog.

[1814.28s -> 1816.44s]  Brand new crisping technology.
[1816.44s -> 1820.84s]  The pot circulates the heat above, below, and in between the fries.
[1820.84s -> 1824.68s]  So that every fry is cooked to the perfect temperature and texture.
[1824.68s -> 1825.08s]  Makes sense.

[1940.36s -> 1942.44s]  But is it really that fast though?
[1942.44s -> 1946.10s]  Because you have to cut the potato.
[1946.10s -> 1951.42s]  And I think I feel like going from potato.

[2064.57s -> 2065.61s]  But that's not all.
[2065.61s -> 2065.93s]  What else?
[2068.97s -> 2069.13s]  What?
[2070.49s -> 2071.69s]  I thought that was an onion.
[2071.69s -> 2071.93s]  Okay.
[2073.85s -> 2074.57s]  All right.
[2074.57s -> 2074.89s]  All right.
[2084.01s -> 2084.57s]  I'm sorry.
[2085.69s -> 2088.09s]  This is cool but like totally just looks like a mess.
[2095.72s -> 2096.60s]  That's a big deal.
[2096.60s -> 2096.92s]  Okay.
[2096.92s -> 2098.12s]  That's what I was concerned about.
[2101.00s -> 2102.12s]  I was concerned about that.
[2107.96s -> 2108.52s]  I get the idea.
[2108.52s -> 2109.32s]  It's an interesting idea.
[2115.80s -> 2116.44s]  Picky eaters.
[2120.28s -> 2120.76s]  Pesto.
[2123.32s -> 2125.00s]  Oh this is ribbon slicing now.
[2125.72s -> 2127.96s]  Fettuccine or curly lasagna.
[2127.96s -> 2130.04s]  Ribbon cut cucumbers for salad.
[2130.04s -> 2131.40s]  You can eat and more.
[2131.40s -> 2132.60s]  As a bonus you'll also.
[2136.15s -> 2137.11s]  That kind of looks gross.
[2137.91s -> 2144.06s]  It looks like a salad with way too much dressing on it.
[2148.39s -> 2148.87s]  All right.
[2148.87s -> 2149.75s]  It doesn't do apples.
[2149.75s -> 2149.91s]  Right.
[2149.91s -> 2150.23s]  Okay.
[2150.23s -> 2153.59s]  So it's like a peeler essentially but a little more involved.
[2153.59s -> 2154.07s]  I'm into it.
[2154.07s -> 2155.03s]  I think it's cool.
[2155.03s -> 2156.95s]  I think that's fine.
[2160.62s -> 2160.86s]  Yeah.
[2162.46s -> 2162.62s]  Okay.
[2163.58s -> 2164.54s]  If you've had this on the counter.
[2165.54s -> 2168.60s]  And I like I can't either came you've not invited me to your house.
[2168.60s -> 2170.52s]  Something like oh hey dude like come on I'll come over.
[2170.52s -> 2171.24s]  I'm like oh I'll come over.
[2171.24s -> 2172.20s]  This sounds fun.
[2172.20s -> 2175.24s]  So I get there and I like put my backpack down and I put my baseball cap down.
[2175.80s -> 2180.04s]  And I sit on the couch or whatever and you say oh hey look what I got.
[2180.04s -> 2181.32s]  I've got the Vigetti.
[2181.32s -> 2184.89s]  I'd look over and I'd be like whoa let's do it.
[2184.89s -> 2185.29s]  Let's go.
[2185.29s -> 2185.69s]  Let's do it.
[2185.69s -> 2185.93s]  Let's do it.
[2185.93s -> 2186.41s]  That'd be fun.
[2186.41s -> 2188.41s]  Like that'd be the fun thing that we would do.
[2188.41s -> 2192.38s]  And like that I would have a good time doing that I think.
[2192.38s -> 2193.98s]  I think it'd be fun to do that.
[2193.98s -> 2196.49s]  Why do you have a backpack on?
[2200.15s -> 2201.19s]  No it's not.
[2201.19s -> 2202.47s]  Not a grinder date.
[2212.46s -> 2213.02s]  Okay.
[2213.02s -> 2213.90s]  Fuck that.
[2213.90s -> 2215.02s]  I'm out of here.
[2215.02s -> 2218.92s]  All right the Vigetti Pro I give it a fucking seven.
[2218.92s -> 2220.20s]  What about the perfect pancake?
[2220.20s -> 2221.64s]  You flip but they flop.
[2221.64s -> 2223.32s]  You flip but they flop.
[2223.32s -> 2224.76s]  Now your pancakes are a mess.
[2224.76s -> 2225.72s]  Oh wait wait wait wait.
[2225.72s -> 2226.84s]  You flip but they.
[2226.84s -> 2228.12s]  Okay remember.
[2228.76s -> 2231.62s]  Shit faced.
[2231.62s -> 2233.14s]  You flip but they flop.
[2233.14s -> 2234.82s]  You flip but they flop.
[2234.82s -> 2236.50s]  Now your pancakes are a mess.
[2236.50s -> 2238.82s]  And all that butter and fat to cook them.
[2238.82s -> 2240.50s]  There's got to be a better way.
[2240.50s -> 2241.62s]  Hi Mark Gill here.
[2241.62s -> 2243.38s]  If I was trashed I would love those.
[2243.38s -> 2244.90s]  The fast easy spatula.
[2244.90s -> 2246.50s]  Yeah there was a million of these.
[2247.38s -> 2248.42s]  There was so many of these.
[2248.42s -> 2252.18s]  Watch just close the handle and flip it.
[2252.18s -> 2253.14s]  Yes.
[2253.14s -> 2256.98s]  Portland ground pancakes with no mess and no added fat.
[2256.98s -> 2259.78s]  The reason is this double-sided non-stick surface.
[2259.78s -> 2263.62s]  That's so slippery not even burnt on cheese will stick to it.
[2263.62s -> 2266.58s]  Flip delicious blueberry fluffy apple cinnamon.
[2266.58s -> 2269.30s]  Or four mouth-watering buttermilk flapjacks.
[2269.30s -> 2269.62s]  Yeah.
[2269.62s -> 2272.66s]  Fast easy and without ever using a spatula.
[2272.66s -> 2276.26s]  If you can turn a doorknob you can use the burnt on cheese.
[2276.26s -> 2278.10s]  They always use that as an example.
[2278.98s -> 2281.70s]  But watch what happens with the perfect pancake pan.
[2281.70s -> 2283.34s]  Eggs over easy.
[2283.34s -> 2283.82s]  All right.
[2283.82s -> 2285.18s]  Ever breaking a yolk.
[2285.18s -> 2285.74s]  Amazing.
[2285.74s -> 2287.02s]  All right that was kind of cool.
[2287.02s -> 2288.06s]  Gingerbread pancakes.
[2288.06s -> 2292.86s]  Fluffy cranberry or mountains of chocolate chip pancakes for the kids in an instant.
[2292.86s -> 2296.78s]  You can also make delicious dessert crepes or four healthy egg sandwiches.
[2296.86s -> 2297.82s]  Oh egg sandwiches.
[2298.86s -> 2300.38s]  Just like from a restaurant.
[2300.38s -> 2302.54s]  Why flip and flop one at a time.
[2302.54s -> 2305.82s]  Call now and make four perfect pancakes at the same time.
[2305.82s -> 2307.34s]  All right I don't know why.
[2308.06s -> 2308.78s]  I just imagine.
[2311.10s -> 2316.20s]  Okay pan the camera up and there's a person with a lit cigarette in their mouth.
[2316.20s -> 2318.20s]  And it's only like half left.
[2318.20s -> 2320.84s]  And they're just like sitting there with they're just smoking.
[2321.56s -> 2323.00s]  That's I just see a cigarette.
[2323.00s -> 2324.44s]  I see like just a lit cigarette.
[2326.58s -> 2328.46s]  Time call now.
[2328.46s -> 2329.50s]  Slimesicle welcome.
[2329.50s -> 2330.84s]  Thanks for the raid.
[2330.84s -> 2331.40s]  Welcome everybody.
[2331.40s -> 2332.60s]  We're doing product reviews.
[2333.40s -> 2334.76s]  Infomercial product reviews.
[2334.76s -> 2335.64s]  Hope you had a good stream.
[2335.64s -> 2336.28s]  Welcome.
[2336.28s -> 2339.85s]  This was the pancakes all at once.
[2339.85s -> 2340.89s]  I don't even know what this was called.
[2341.77s -> 2342.65s]  But thanks.
[2342.65s -> 2346.42s]  Welcome.
[2346.42s -> 2350.58s]  Four perfect pancakes at the same time with the perfect pancake pan.
[2350.58s -> 2352.26s]  And our fast and fluffy recipe.
[2352.26s -> 2353.30s]  Everything was 1995.
[2355.78s -> 2360.74s]  If you had a product back in like the mid-2000s or early kind of early 2000s and late 90s.
[2360.82s -> 2363.46s]  And your product was less or more than 1995.
[2363.46s -> 2365.69s]  You lost board members.
[2365.69s -> 2366.97s]  Executives would leave.
[2366.97s -> 2373.03s]  Now and we'll double your order free.
[2373.03s -> 2374.79s]  Just pay separate shipping and handling.
[2374.79s -> 2375.03s]  All right.
[2375.03s -> 2375.67s]  Yeah that's all right.
[2375.67s -> 2376.07s]  Let's go.
[2377.94s -> 2378.58s]  What about this one?
[2379.30s -> 2379.94s]  All right here we go.
[2379.94s -> 2381.06s]  Mighty meatballs.
[2381.06s -> 2385.35s]  This one is going to be interesting.
[2385.35s -> 2385.83s]  Mark Gill.
[2392.07s -> 2392.55s]  I trust him.
[2399.11s -> 2401.27s]  Four delicious meatballs at once.
[2401.27s -> 2402.31s]  It's so simple.
[2402.31s -> 2405.99s]  And believe me if you tried to make stuffed meatballs without one.
[2405.99s -> 2407.35s]  Stuffed meatballs.
[2407.35s -> 2408.47s]  All you do is.
[2408.47s -> 2409.43s]  That was huge.
[2409.43s -> 2410.95s]  That was a fucking softball.
[2411.99s -> 2413.43s]  Who's making that?
[2413.43s -> 2413.99s]  Wait a minute.
[2413.99s -> 2414.39s]  Wait a minute.
[2414.39s -> 2414.79s]  Wait a minute.
[2414.79s -> 2415.99s]  That was a softball.
[2415.99s -> 2417.90s]  There's going to be a big.
[2417.90s -> 2418.94s]  Oh I swear to God.
[2418.94s -> 2420.78s]  Grandma's Italian meatballs.
[2423.50s -> 2424.22s]  Holy shit.
[2424.22s -> 2428.41s]  Two up to seal.
[2428.41s -> 2431.53s]  Mighty meatball makes four large stuffed meatballs every time.
[2431.53s -> 2432.09s]  That was a big.
[2432.81s -> 2433.37s]  I smell that.
[2433.37s -> 2433.85s]  I've been out there.
[2442.49s -> 2443.29s]  I don't know about that.
[2445.05s -> 2445.77s]  I don't know about that.
[2445.77s -> 2446.41s]  I don't know about that.
[2451.37s -> 2453.85s]  I get the stuffed burger thing but stuffed meatballs.
[2453.85s -> 2454.65s]  I'm not so sure.
[2457.22s -> 2458.90s]  Bacon, mac and cheese, meatballs.
[2458.90s -> 2460.74s]  I feel like this is a kid's menu.
[2460.74s -> 2462.34s]  Is this the kid's menu?
[2462.90s -> 2466.74s]  Stuffed ground chicken with ham and swiss for cordon bleu that just can't miss.
[2466.74s -> 2471.94s]  Or use ground turkey with stuffing and cranberry sauce for the best turkey meatballs ever.
[2471.94s -> 2473.78s]  And it's not just for meatballs.
[2473.78s -> 2476.18s]  Make cheesy garlic stuffed mashed potatoes.
[2476.18s -> 2476.98s]  Yeah this is like.
[2480.15s -> 2480.79s]  What the fuck?
[2484.60s -> 2486.02s]  I get it.
[2486.02s -> 2486.82s]  I get the idea.
[2489.14s -> 2490.34s]  What about easy butter?
[2490.34s -> 2499.13s]  Loves butter but getting it out of the fridge out of the wrap onto your food is a real asshole.
[2499.21s -> 2500.65s]  Introducing easy butter.
[2502.17s -> 2504.01s]  Okay the problem was not the butter.
[2504.65s -> 2508.65s]  The problem was you leaving your toast in the toaster for like 40 minutes.
[2513.85s -> 2515.37s]  All right this is fucking awesome actually.
[2521.22s -> 2521.78s]  Holy shit.
[2525.94s -> 2526.82s]  This is awesome.
[2529.78s -> 2530.42s]  What?
[2530.42s -> 2532.18s]  All right do they still make this?
[2535.14s -> 2535.78s]  That's insane.
[2548.10s -> 2549.38s]  Am I insane for liking this?
[2554.78s -> 2557.02s]  Okay this is an incredible product I think.
[2559.86s -> 2563.06s]  You don't want your like five-year-old daughter saying that by the way.
[2564.02s -> 2564.74s]  You don't want to.
[2565.70s -> 2568.76s]  All right you know where's the vegetables?
[2568.76s -> 2569.48s]  Where are the vegetables?
[2569.48s -> 2571.64s]  Where's the zucchini slicer?
[2571.64s -> 2572.86s]  Where's the zucchini slicer?
[2572.86s -> 2573.74s]  We need that back.
[2573.74s -> 2575.40s]  Where's the zucchini slicer?
[2586.49s -> 2586.97s]  What is that?
[2588.89s -> 2589.69s]  Who's doing that?
[2594.81s -> 2595.77s]  I like this though.
[2598.65s -> 2601.29s]  But with your order today we'll double the offer.
[2601.29s -> 2602.33s]  All right so that's five dollars.
[2605.85s -> 2606.33s]  Cheese?
[2606.97s -> 2608.09s]  Wait there's more?
[2611.45s -> 2612.73s]  Why would you put a hot dog in there?
[2614.17s -> 2614.49s]  Hold on.
[2622.17s -> 2623.13s]  A hot dog?
[2623.69s -> 2627.43s]  Why would you put a hot dog in there for little kids?
[2628.07s -> 2629.91s]  But like just it's like fun to I mean.
[2631.00s -> 2633.64s]  Slicing a hot dog is not as difficult as slicing cold butter.
[2635.98s -> 2636.54s]  Bananas?
[2640.46s -> 2641.50s]  Cutting the hot dog is simple.
[2643.50s -> 2645.90s]  I could cut a hot dog up in like literally five seconds.
[2645.90s -> 2647.98s]  It's just like one, two, three, four, five.
[2647.98s -> 2648.78s]  It's not a big deal.
[2648.78s -> 2649.58s]  Cutting butter is hard.
[2652.28s -> 2653.16s]  All right that's pretty sick.
[2654.36s -> 2656.60s]  I'd say of all the products we've seen of like the ten we've seen.
[2656.60s -> 2658.36s]  I like that one the most.
[2659.48s -> 2660.44s]  I want an easy eggwich.
[2689.30s -> 2690.58s]  Okay the other steam products.
[2691.54s -> 2692.66s]  Didn't need to go in the microwave.
[2696.66s -> 2697.46s]  Was it the Egg Genie?
[2699.30s -> 2700.26s]  That's kind of thick too.
[2720.58s -> 2722.34s]  Okay.
[2723.86s -> 2724.74s]  It's easy though.
[2724.74s -> 2726.10s]  It's simple whatever.
[2732.42s -> 2733.38s]  And that was another thing too.
[2734.42s -> 2736.58s]  Why were people so obsessed with this too?
[2737.30s -> 2738.02s]  Help me with this.
[2738.82s -> 2740.26s]  Oh and cooking in oil.
[2740.26s -> 2741.46s]  No one wants to do that.
[2745.21s -> 2747.05s]  Olive oil is like fucking not bad for you.
[2747.85s -> 2749.61s]  Cooking in like an olive oil?
[2749.61s -> 2750.73s]  Like a light olive oil?
[2752.50s -> 2756.95s]  Don't and then think about how much oil you'll be using.
[2756.95s -> 2759.96s]  What was like the the war on fat?
[2759.96s -> 2760.76s]  Like fats?
[2761.98s -> 2762.94s]  No no no no no.
[2762.94s -> 2764.46s]  Don't have those omega-3s.
[2764.46s -> 2765.58s]  Don't eat them.
[2765.58s -> 2766.62s]  Don't touch those.
[2766.62s -> 2771.26s]  That's look we're gonna have a tray that all the oil drips into this tray.
[2771.26s -> 2772.14s]  And then don't eat that.
[2772.14s -> 2773.42s]  That's that's disgusting.
[2773.42s -> 2776.55s]  How vile.
[2776.55s -> 2779.27s]  Oil's like a good oil like an olive oil.
[2779.27s -> 2780.47s]  Like sunflower oil.
[2780.47s -> 2783.11s]  This stuff is not bad for you.
[2783.11s -> 2784.23s]  It's not bad for you.
[2784.23s -> 2785.91s]  It's actually has a lot of benefits.
[2790.55s -> 2794.94s]  Olive oil is fantastic for you.
[2794.94s -> 2796.06s]  But not essential oil.
[2797.74s -> 2799.34s]  Sunflower oil is bad.
[2799.34s -> 2802.07s]  I'm talking about yeah but I said olive oil.
[2802.07s -> 2802.87s]  Avocado oil.
[2802.87s -> 2805.75s]  You have you ever cooked with avocado oil before?
[2805.75s -> 2808.15s]  Have you cooked with like a good olive oil?
[2808.15s -> 2810.31s]  It's like it adds to your food.
[2810.31s -> 2811.19s]  Doesn't take away from it.
[2812.71s -> 2816.89s]  Carbs are killer.
[2816.89s -> 2818.17s]  Peanut oil is amazing.
[2818.17s -> 2821.21s]  Yeah dude what is with this war on like oil?
[2822.81s -> 2823.45s]  I don't get that.
[2823.45s -> 2824.97s]  In a cabinet so many.
[2826.18s -> 2828.58s]  But put butter all over everything.
[2828.58s -> 2831.21s]  I love butter oil.
[2834.07s -> 2835.11s]  Oh it's oil.
[2835.11s -> 2837.27s]  That's even the word oil.
[2837.99s -> 2839.99s]  It's like it would come out of the ground.
[2841.03s -> 2841.75s]  What's going on here?
[2841.75s -> 2844.31s]  All here in the one minute easy eggwich recipe guy.
[2844.31s -> 2846.31s]  And they always show like eating steaks.
[2846.31s -> 2850.44s]  Oh it can even flip a eight pound steak.
[2850.44s -> 2852.36s]  Don't cook it in that disgusting oil.
[2853.54s -> 2854.26s]  I don't get it.
[2854.26s -> 2858.34s]  Now give your family a hot fresh breakfast in one minute with easy eggwich.
[2858.34s -> 2859.38s]  Call now and get.
[2859.38s -> 2860.02s]  All right we get it.
[2861.18s -> 2861.90s]  Nah I wouldn't get it.
[2861.90s -> 2863.02s]  I wouldn't buy that one.
[2863.02s -> 2864.65s]  How about burrito perfect?
[2870.46s -> 2872.62s]  Love burritos but hate the mess.
[2872.62s -> 2876.30s]  You fill fold and roll but could never get that perfect hold.
[2876.30s -> 2876.78s]  That's true.
[2876.78s -> 2879.02s]  And store-bought burritos are just not the same.
[2879.02s -> 2879.50s]  That's true.
[2879.50s -> 2881.18s]  Introducing burrito perfect.
[2881.18s -> 2884.14s]  The simple fast mess-free way to make perfect burritos.
[2884.14s -> 2885.26s]  What is this?
[2885.26s -> 2885.90s]  Watch.
[2885.90s -> 2887.42s]  It's a t-shirt holder.
[2887.42s -> 2888.46s]  Burrito perfect.
[2888.46s -> 2893.34s]  Fill it with your favorite toppings such as rice, beans, chicken, lettuce, cheese,
[2893.34s -> 2894.46s]  and guacamole.
[2894.46s -> 2899.42s]  Then fold one, two, three, and you get a perfect burrito with ease.
[2899.42s -> 2901.98s]  Now you can make quick and simple breakfast burritos.
[2901.98s -> 2903.42s]  Steak fajita burritos.
[2903.42s -> 2904.70s]  Chicken and cheese burritos.
[2904.70s -> 2906.06s]  It's a t-shirt holder.
[2906.06s -> 2907.10s]  Vegetable burritos.
[2907.10s -> 2907.74s]  But what if you-
[2907.74s -> 2909.18s]  Okay I use-
[2909.18s -> 2910.54s]  I always overfill.
[2911.42s -> 2912.14s]  What the fuck?
[2913.10s -> 2913.50s]  Hold on.
[2913.50s -> 2916.06s]  Your family will enjoy making their own favorite burrito.
[2916.06s -> 2916.70s]  Huh?
[2916.70s -> 2917.66s]  There's nothing in there.
[2918.46s -> 2919.10s]  There's nothing in there.
[2919.10s -> 2920.78s]  They're making their own favorite burrito.
[2920.78s -> 2922.65s]  There's nothing in there.
[2922.65s -> 2928.76s]  There's nothing in here.
[2928.76s -> 2931.24s]  You know without the mess all by themselves.
[2931.24s -> 2932.52s]  She said this is just a tortilla.
[2933.32s -> 2937.40s]  No more frustration folding burritos and worrying about getting it on your clothes.
[2937.40s -> 2940.84s]  Enjoy making your own fresh flavorful burrito without the spills.
[2940.84s -> 2942.84s]  Burrito perfect is also great for-
[2942.84s -> 2943.88s]  Yeah but okay.
[2943.88s -> 2944.60s]  Okay listen.
[2945.58s -> 2948.54s]  When you make a burrito, I don't care who you are.
[2948.54s -> 2951.51s]  I don't care what your food preferences are.
[2951.51s -> 2953.98s]  I don't give a shit.
[2953.98s -> 2955.66s]  You always put way too much in.
[2956.22s -> 2958.22s]  Because you go, oh yeah give me some ground beef.
[2959.03s -> 2959.59s]  A little bit more.
[2959.59s -> 2961.51s]  I think I need a little bit kind of hungry.
[2961.51s -> 2964.12s]  And the ground beef is like a mound this high.
[2964.12s -> 2966.04s]  Uh I want like shredded lettuce in this.
[2966.04s -> 2966.84s]  Like shredded lettuce.
[2966.84s -> 2967.40s]  Shredded lettuce.
[2967.40s -> 2968.79s]  Shredded lettuce.
[2968.79s -> 2969.27s]  Tomato.
[2969.27s -> 2969.99s]  Like tomato chunks.
[2969.99s -> 2970.39s]  Tomato chunks.
[2970.39s -> 2971.19s]  A little bit of salsa.
[2971.19s -> 2972.39s]  Oh I got a-
[2972.39s -> 2975.18s]  Is there enough room for cheese in here?
[2975.18s -> 2976.62s]  Uh yeah I'll put some cheese on it too.
[2976.62s -> 2977.18s]  Like a lot.
[2977.18s -> 2979.22s]  I want a lot of cheese on this.
[2979.22s -> 2980.34s]  And then you go, this is not rolling.
[2980.34s -> 2981.54s]  This is never gonna roll.
[2981.54s -> 2983.22s]  I'm never gonna have this be a burrito.
[2983.22s -> 2985.94s]  So I'm just gonna put my hands underneath it and like kind of cup it.
[2985.94s -> 2987.86s]  And eat it like a folded pizza slice.
[2989.40s -> 2991.96s]  So this product would never work for me.
[2991.96s -> 2992.76s]  Ever.
[2992.76s -> 2994.63s]  Because there's not enough in here.
[2995.19s -> 2995.74s]  I-
[2995.74s -> 2996.38s]  There's not enough.
[2998.66s -> 3002.17s]  This is not a substantial burrito for me.
[3002.17s -> 3002.73s]  Like a taco.
[3002.73s -> 3003.29s]  Yeah like-
[3003.29s -> 3008.01s]  Like fold it up and eat it like a soft taco.
[3008.01s -> 3008.57s]  I-
[3008.57s -> 3010.09s]  Kids might have fun with this though right?
[3010.09s -> 3011.21s]  If you use this for-
[3011.21s -> 3012.73s]  Because look a kid's not gonna-
[3012.73s -> 3014.57s]  Oh hey roll a burrito son!
[3014.57s -> 3015.77s]  That's four years old.
[3016.70s -> 3017.42s]  And they're gonna be like-
[3017.42s -> 3017.92s]  I-
[3019.78s -> 3020.28s]  My head!
[3020.28s -> 3022.18s]  AHHHHHH!
[3022.18s -> 3024.50s]  And they're gonna start fucking crying and it's gonna be a disaster.
[3024.50s -> 3026.22s]  So I mean like this-
[3026.22s -> 3027.50s]  You can make like little-
[3027.50s -> 3030.54s]  Pancake pastries and burritos and stuff be fine right?
[3030.54s -> 3031.58s]  I can see it.
[3031.58s -> 3032.46s]  For crepes!
[3032.46s -> 3034.22s]  Make strawberries and cream crepes,
[3034.22s -> 3035.42s]  Chocolate banana crepes,
[3035.42s -> 3037.02s]  Peach crepes and more!
[3037.02s -> 3039.26s]  What a mistake not leading with that.
[3039.26s -> 3043.18s]  For a limited time you'll get the burrito perfect for only $9.99!
[3043.18s -> 3046.78s]  But if you call now you'll also get a hard shell taco holder free!
[3046.78s -> 3048.86s]  Hate holding the taco shell and mess in your hand?
[3048.86s -> 3049.66s]  Use the grape for once.
[3049.66s -> 3052.94s]  Now just place your taco shell in the taco holder and fill it with meat,
[3052.94s -> 3053.98s]  Topped with lettuce,
[3053.98s -> 3054.86s]  Shredded cheese,
[3054.86s -> 3056.06s]  Your favorite salsa,
[3056.06s -> 3057.82s]  And enjoy classic meat tacos,
[3057.82s -> 3058.86s]  Chicken tacos,
[3058.86s -> 3060.38s]  Seafood tacos and more!

[3085.34s -> 3086.94s]  For only $9.99!
[3086.94s -> 3088.46s]  These incredible office gear...
[3088.46s -> 3088.96s]  Stop.
[3091.56s -> 3092.06s]  Okay.
[3093.11s -> 3094.23s]  You saw easy butter.
[3095.90s -> 3096.62s]  Perfect brownie.
[3096.62s -> 3100.22s]  Alright, perfect brownie is an automatic absolute buy for me.
[3101.08s -> 3103.22s]  Because you get edges.
[3103.22s -> 3104.42s]  It gives you edges.
[3104.42s -> 3107.43s]  You'll see what I mean.
[3107.43s -> 3108.95s]  Cut, rip, and tear.
[3108.95s -> 3111.35s]  But your brownies never turn out square.
[3111.35s -> 3113.67s]  And when they're stuck, you're totally out of luck.
[3113.67s -> 3114.17s]  No.
[3114.95s -> 3116.07s]  You have to throw the pan away.
[3116.07s -> 3117.19s]  Now you're talking about the brownie pan!
[3117.19s -> 3120.49s]  The new non-stick way to bake, slice, and serve perfect brownies!
[3120.49s -> 3121.45s]  That whole pan's gotta go.
[3121.45s -> 3122.17s]  You try it.
[3122.17s -> 3123.93s]  Just pour in your favorite batter.
[3123.93s -> 3124.57s]  Insert the diffuser...
[3124.57s -> 3124.97s]  Yup.
[3124.97s -> 3126.01s]  Everything gets an edge.
[3126.01s -> 3126.57s]  Yeah, come on.
[3126.57s -> 3129.53s]  ...18 chocolatey brownies sliced all at once.
[3129.53s -> 3130.25s]  The reason?
[3130.25s -> 3133.37s]  The unique design and durable non-stick coating.
[3133.37s -> 3136.09s]  Not even 18 marshmallow treats will stick.
[3136.09s -> 3136.81s]  And look!
[3136.81s -> 3138.65s]  The bottom and sides separate.
[3138.65s -> 3140.33s]  So anytime it goes on this rack...
[3140.33s -> 3140.83s]  Wha...
[3140.83s -> 3143.45s]  ...perfect brownie becomes the sweetest party serving term.
[3143.45s -> 3144.81s]  Anime voiceover?
[3144.81s -> 3147.37s]  Serve crazy top brownies for birthdays.
[3147.37s -> 3148.09s]  Marvel swirl for graduation.
[3148.09s -> 3149.53s]  I mean, I was gonna say, it sounds like kind of like...
[3149.53s -> 3152.81s]  Delicious double fudge brownies at your very own bake sale.
[3152.81s -> 3153.77s]  Cha-ching!
[3153.77s -> 3154.25s]  Oh no!
[3154.25s -> 3154.97s]  Cha-ching!
[3154.97s -> 3159.51s]  This pan which bakes eats brownies.
[3159.51s -> 3160.63s]  It looks so fucked up!
[3160.63s -> 3163.59s]  Someone ate all the edges again.
[3163.59s -> 3165.67s]  No, a raccoon got in the house.
[3166.54s -> 3168.74s]  So I would throw the whole thing away.
[3170.41s -> 3172.33s]  That's not like, oh, dad!
[3172.33s -> 3177.13s]  Dad ate all the edges that an animal got in your house.
[3177.13s -> 3180.46s]  And I don't know if this is probably not standard here to eat this.
[3180.46s -> 3181.42s]  The solution?
[3181.42s -> 3184.68s]  Design which bakes each brownie separately.
[3184.68s -> 3187.88s]  So they're moist inside and chewy outside.
[3187.88s -> 3191.64s]  If you can make ice cubes, you can use Perfect Brownie Pan.
[3191.64s -> 3192.68s]  Now stack them for ice cubes and sandwiches...
[3192.68s -> 3194.20s]  Yeah, no, these are better.
[3194.20s -> 3196.28s]  These are way better than doing it in a regular pan.
[3196.28s -> 3196.76s]  It just is.
[3196.76s -> 3199.00s]  ...holidays, anniversaries, or barbecues.
[3199.00s -> 3202.20s]  Just bake, slice, and serve without ever using a knife.
[3202.20s -> 3205.62s]  It's a gimmick product, but it does what it's supposed to do.
[3205.62s -> 3211.94s]  Perfect Brownie Pan comes with the gooey and chewy recipe guide for the amazing low price of just $19.95.
[3211.94s -> 3213.70s]  And it's not just for brownies.
[3213.70s -> 3218.18s]  Make fluffy cakes, awesome bar cookies, or Grandma's Apple Pie Squares.
[3218.18s -> 3219.46s]  Grandma's Apple Pie Squares.
[3219.46s -> 3223.38s]  Smart shoppers receive these decorative stencils to make listive treats,
[3223.38s -> 3228.18s]  like flags on the Fourth of July, or transform any dessert into a work of art.
[3228.18s -> 3229.14s]  Oh, that's kind of cool.
[3229.14s -> 3232.02s]  You'll get the complete Perfect Brownie Pan with Divider,
[3232.02s -> 3236.34s]  Starbucks, ten stencils, and recipe guide for only $19.95.
[3236.34s -> 3237.53s]  That's right.
[3239.11s -> 3239.43s]  Cool.
[3239.43s -> 3239.75s]  All right.
[3239.75s -> 3241.75s]  That one, that's a classic.
[3241.75s -> 3242.31s]  All right.
[3242.31s -> 3245.35s]  The Chop Magic, the Go-Grill.
[3247.46s -> 3247.94s]  All right.
[3247.94s -> 3248.50s]  I don't know.
[3248.50s -> 3251.48s]  I kind of like, I haven't watched all of them.
[3251.48s -> 3253.75s]  I just watch every single one of these.
[3253.75s -> 3255.35s]  All right, let's do the Chop Magic.
[3255.35s -> 3262.42s]  And first of all, we got, first of all, this is important.
[3262.42s -> 3265.14s]  We've got Mark Gill here, which is automatic.
[3265.14s -> 3269.83s]  Like this product, I'm interested already, already, right off the bat.
[3269.83s -> 3272.63s]  Hi, Mark Gill here with the Chop Magic.
[3272.63s -> 3277.91s]  You're going to love the way this beauty can chop, mince, slice, and dice in just seconds.
[3278.31s -> 3281.83s]  Chopping vegetables the old way takes forever.
[3281.83s -> 3282.07s]  Yeah.
[3282.07s -> 3283.83s]  It's tough work and such a mess.
[3283.83s -> 3284.15s]  Yeah.
[3284.15s -> 3285.51s]  Well, not with Chop Magic.
[3285.51s -> 3285.75s]  Okay.
[3285.75s -> 3290.39s]  Go ahead, chop a whole onion in one second, no odor and no tears.
[3290.39s -> 3290.63s]  Okay.
[3290.63s -> 3294.07s]  Chili and pepper, squash and zucchini in just three seconds.
[3294.07s -> 3294.39s]  You got it.
[3294.39s -> 3296.47s]  That's a stir fry that makes other choppers cry.
[3296.47s -> 3297.51s]  And it's safe too.
[3297.51s -> 3299.43s]  It's strong enough to go through solid sweet.
[3299.43s -> 3299.67s]  All right.
[3299.67s -> 3304.71s]  So here's why the other thing where it was the big like Dark Souls wheel, like weapon,
[3305.43s -> 3308.55s]  like pushing that down with the blades and shit.
[3308.55s -> 3311.16s]  This is has safety in mind.
[3311.16s -> 3312.84s]  You get it on the blade.
[3312.84s -> 3316.04s]  You line it up and you're not going to touch it.
[3316.04s -> 3318.94s]  It's not going to you.
[3318.94s -> 3320.54s]  The little prongs up top.
[3320.54s -> 3322.15s]  That's good.
[3322.15s -> 3322.63s]  I like that.
[3323.75s -> 3324.23s]  I like that a lot.
[3324.23s -> 3325.03s]  Yeah.
[3325.03s -> 3328.07s]  Easily chopped delicate tomatoes to perfection.
[3328.07s -> 3329.59s]  Now make fresh egg salad.
[3329.59s -> 3332.79s]  Healthy coleslaw needs to be pre-cut in no time.
[3332.87s -> 3333.35s]  That's it.
[3339.35s -> 3339.83s]  What's wrong with that?
[3345.99s -> 3347.83s]  I mean, they're all cubes though, right?
[3350.55s -> 3356.02s]  Presentation wise, everything is a ham cube.
[3356.02s -> 3356.50s]  Everything.
[3357.06s -> 3360.60s]  Everything is a ham cube.
[3360.60s -> 3364.84s]  So, I mean, presentation wise, maybe not, but practical, I think so.
[3365.64s -> 3370.52s]  Instantly prepare fresh fruit salads, zesty salsa, or a mountain of garlic without it
[3370.52s -> 3371.16s]  sticking to your head.
[3371.16s -> 3373.24s]  Somebody called me an infomercial centrist.
[3373.24s -> 3376.57s]  You can say it sucks.
[3376.57s -> 3380.65s]  Did you not hear me talk about the fucking microwave one, the one with the eggs?
[3380.65s -> 3382.41s]  I was like, nah, I don't think so.
[3382.41s -> 3384.92s]  What do you mean infomercial centrist?
[3387.74s -> 3389.58s]  I'm being honest and being very thorough.
[3390.38s -> 3391.42s]  I'm being very thorough.
[3394.86s -> 3397.74s]  Yeah, but nobody, nobody, dishwashers, nobody uses dishwasher.
[3400.74s -> 3402.74s]  I use my dishwasher.
[3402.74s -> 3408.30s]  I've run my dishwasher because otherwise it'll get gross.
[3409.58s -> 3411.50s]  I wash by hand.
[3412.63s -> 3415.51s]  I don't like that idea of take, oh yeah, there's like a bunch of
[3415.51s -> 3418.71s]  fucking like salsa and like mess on my plate.
[3418.71s -> 3420.47s]  Just stick it in here and turn the water on.
[3420.47s -> 3422.78s]  No, I don't like the dishwasher.
[3422.78s -> 3424.52s]  I don't like it.
[3424.52s -> 3427.30s]  And you know, I also, I don't like the dishwasher.
[3427.30s -> 3429.38s]  All the people question marking me right now.
[3429.38s -> 3433.38s]  So you enjoy putting like your dishes in this thing.
[3433.38s -> 3438.34s]  And then like, for like at least one to two fucking hours, you hear.
[3445.86s -> 3447.06s]  It's fucking obnoxious.
[3447.70s -> 3448.66s]  It's obnoxious.
[3448.66s -> 3454.17s]  And it lasts for an hour, an hour, two fucking hours of this.
[3454.17s -> 3459.14s]  You can, I can wash a whole fucking sink of dishes in 20 minutes.
[3459.14s -> 3461.06s]  Dishwashers are just loud, annoying.
[3461.06s -> 3463.38s]  They take way too long, a bunch of water.
[3463.38s -> 3464.58s]  No, no, no, no.
[3464.58s -> 3467.78s]  Sometimes I'll use it if I need to, you know, no, never.
[3467.78s -> 3469.82s]  Sounds like your dishwasher sucks.
[3469.82s -> 3471.50s]  Your dishwasher is broken.
[3471.50s -> 3476.33s]  What are you talking about?
[3476.33s -> 3482.36s]  Your dishwasher is fucked up.
[3482.36s -> 3485.70s]  That's impossible.
[3485.70s -> 3486.34s]  No, it's not.
[3487.22s -> 3488.63s]  No, it's not possible.
[3490.55s -> 3491.67s]  I don't use it.
[3491.67s -> 3494.17s]  They're not that loud normally.
[3494.17s -> 3495.37s]  I don't use this.
[3495.37s -> 3497.69s]  How would the dishwasher be broken if it was, if I never use it?
[3505.30s -> 3506.50s]  That's a huge amount of food.
[3509.11s -> 3510.63s]  All right.
[3510.63s -> 3510.95s]  Cool.
[3510.95s -> 3511.99s]  Chop magic is pretty cool.
[3511.99s -> 3512.39s]  I like it.
[3512.95s -> 3514.01s]  All right.
[3514.01s -> 3514.89s]  What about the go grill?
[3519.32s -> 3519.56s]  Yep.
[3530.33s -> 3531.61s]  Holy shit.
[3531.61s -> 3533.77s]  Can you imagine seeing somebody do this?
[3538.92s -> 3541.40s]  You don't want to, you try to load
[3542.12s -> 3545.56s]  your backyard grill into the trunk of your car.
[3549.67s -> 3550.79s]  Where are you taking this?
[3551.35s -> 3552.39s]  Where are you taking this?
[3554.95s -> 3555.27s]  Bugs.
[3556.89s -> 3558.89s]  But honestly, I, yeah, no.
[3565.43s -> 3565.67s]  Okay.
[3573.75s -> 3574.79s]  All these sound effects.
[3578.79s -> 3578.95s]  Okay.
[3578.95s -> 3585.27s]  You know, your product is really kind of just boring where you can't just show it.
[3585.27s -> 3588.63s]  You have to have like lasers and whooshing sounds.
[3594.87s -> 3597.27s]  Or I'm going to give the credit to the editor here.
[3597.27s -> 3601.59s]  The person editing, I would love God, if I could have, I could pick like a job.
[3601.59s -> 3604.95s]  I think it'd be perfect sitting in the editing room
[3604.95s -> 3609.02s]  and just kind of laughing to yourself and being like, yeah, I'm going to put,
[3609.02s -> 3610.62s]  yeah, I'm going to put like whooshing sounds here.
[3611.42s -> 3612.14s]  It's going to be funny.
[3613.69s -> 3614.89s]  I guarantee you they do that.
[3616.97s -> 3617.77s]  There's no way they don't.
[3619.29s -> 3621.05s]  That sounds like a fun like thing to do.
[3627.37s -> 3628.33s]  But only if they win.
[3629.13s -> 3632.09s]  Or grill a seafood delight when you go to the beach.
[3632.09s -> 3634.17s]  It's a must for camping food delight.
[3637.35s -> 3638.63s]  Why is this image so weird to me?
[3641.83s -> 3643.91s]  This is a strange image for some reason.
[3643.91s -> 3647.88s]  Why?
[3647.88s -> 3648.68s]  I can't figure out.
[3649.64s -> 3652.54s]  It's because they're all facing the same direction.
[3652.54s -> 3653.26s]  Yeah.
[3653.26s -> 3659.86s]  All of them are facing this way and the water is the other way
[3659.86s -> 3662.98s]  and you can't put the cameras in the water.
[3662.98s -> 3667.46s]  So this image just looks bizarre.
[3667.54s -> 3670.34s]  Like they don't want to go back to go where the water is.
[3671.54s -> 3672.42s]  This isn't a beach.
[3672.42s -> 3673.30s]  Wait, what is this?
[3674.82s -> 3679.56s]  He just said beach.
[3679.56s -> 3684.58s]  I also feel like this guy is way far away from these two.
[3684.58s -> 3686.74s]  I feel like they did a weird camera thing with this guy
[3686.74s -> 3692.63s]  is actually like 50 feet in front of them.
[3692.63s -> 3695.91s]  It's a must for camping or when you go RV.
[3695.91s -> 3697.27s]  And it's perfect for the boat.
[3697.27s -> 3698.39s]  When you go fishing.
[3698.39s -> 3701.59s]  This low profile fold away grill tucks away almost any.
[3701.59s -> 3702.39s]  Oh, I got a bite.
[3702.39s -> 3703.11s]  Hey, hold on a second.
[3703.51s -> 3705.91s]  I got four chicken breasts on a grill.
[3705.91s -> 3706.23s]  Hold on.
[3706.95s -> 3709.03s]  Oh, you went in the water over in a rowboat?
[3709.03s -> 3709.51s]  Be careful.
[3709.51s -> 3711.11s]  It's perfect when space is tight.
[3711.11s -> 3714.39s]  Your go grill can make 12 burgers sizzle all at once
[3714.39s -> 3716.63s]  or grill 24 hot dogs for an incredible.
[3716.63s -> 3717.59s]  No, that doesn't work.
[3717.59s -> 3719.43s]  If you're the guy that likes baby bags,
[3719.43s -> 3722.23s]  the go grill can handle a full man-sized rack.
[3722.23s -> 3724.63s]  The go grill will feed your full man-sized grill.
[3724.63s -> 3726.47s]  Oh, full man-sized.
[3726.47s -> 3728.15s]  We got man-sized portions.
[3728.79s -> 3729.74s]  You know what I mean?
[3731.08s -> 3732.52s]  Yeah, it's the whole rack.
[3733.40s -> 3735.98s]  Which you'll eat maybe a third of it.
[3737.29s -> 3739.29s]  And then be like, I don't really want any more of this.
[3739.29s -> 3741.29s]  And I have a man-sized portion.
[3741.29s -> 3742.33s]  You throw it away.
[3742.33s -> 3743.61s]  But man-sized though.
[3743.61s -> 3745.62s]  Make sure that's for men.
[3745.62s -> 3748.74s]  The go grill will feed your family and all of your friends.
[3748.74s -> 3750.02s]  What do you like to grill?
[3750.02s -> 3751.62s]  Chicken, steak, or lobster?
[3751.62s -> 3753.06s]  The list never ends.
[3753.06s -> 3756.02s]  The go grill is the most unique grill you'll ever own.
[3756.02s -> 3757.30s]  Take it anywhere you go.
[3757.94s -> 3758.26s]  Okay.
[3758.26s -> 3762.12s]  If I was at a barbecue and I walked up to the person
[3762.12s -> 3764.84s]  that was like, you know, operating the grill and the grill master.
[3765.58s -> 3768.46s]  I was like, oh, yeah, I guess they're ready.
[3768.46s -> 3768.70s]  Yeah.
[3768.70s -> 3769.58s]  Oh, yeah, they're ready.
[3769.58s -> 3771.26s]  You want a man-sized portion?
[3771.26s -> 3776.15s]  I'd be like, no.
[3777.46s -> 3778.74s]  Ah, sure.
[3778.74s -> 3780.10s]  It's like four patties.
[3780.10s -> 3781.62s]  Like, no, I don't want them.
[3781.62s -> 3783.30s]  No, just guys, a regular one.
[3783.30s -> 3785.50s]  Can I just have a regular hamburger?
[3785.50s -> 3787.80s]  Just regular steak?
[3787.80s -> 3790.20s]  Like, I don't want a man-sized portion.
[3790.20s -> 3791.24s]  Join me at home.
[3791.24s -> 3791.88s]  I don't thank you.
[3791.88s -> 3794.60s]  You might expect to pay up to $100 for a grill this versatile.
[3794.60s -> 3797.88s]  But if you call now, your go grill is only $19.99.
[3797.88s -> 3798.38s]  $19.99?
[3799.58s -> 3800.38s]  What the fuck did you say?
[3802.01s -> 3804.63s]  Go grill only $19.99.
[3804.63s -> 3807.08s]  What a fuck-up.
[3807.08s -> 3809.72s]  That's a major fuck-up.
[3810.52s -> 3813.38s]  Order not this 11-piece stainless steel tool.
[3813.38s -> 3814.50s]  I thought this was drill bits.
[3814.50s -> 3816.10s]  Separate processing and handling.
[3816.10s -> 3821.62s]  That's an $80 value all for the incredible low price of only $19.99.
[3825.08s -> 3825.40s]  Okay.
[3826.04s -> 3828.78s]  I will give a positive here.
[3828.78s -> 3831.99s]  Here's the one positive.
[3831.99s -> 3833.51s]  There are tons of portable grills.
[3833.51s -> 3834.31s]  There are.
[3834.31s -> 3835.19s]  There's tons of them.
[3835.83s -> 3841.21s]  A portable grill is actually not a, it's actually pretty cool.
[3841.21s -> 3849.85s]  I would actually rather cook at my home on a portable grill than the huge,
[3850.65s -> 3855.96s]  gigantic grill that needs a bunch of maintenance.
[3855.96s -> 3859.88s]  So I would actually rather one of these than like a real huge grill.
[3859.88s -> 3860.28s]  I don't know.
[3860.28s -> 3861.48s]  That's just like a lot.
[3861.48s -> 3863.61s]  I also don't like propane.
[3863.61s -> 3867.05s]  It scares the shit out of me because just a fucking bunch of gas pressurizes.
[3867.05s -> 3869.13s]  You know how I feel about like pressurized gas and stuff.
[3869.13s -> 3871.05s]  So I don't like using propane.
[3871.05s -> 3871.77s]  I like charcoal.
[3872.33s -> 3873.45s]  And charcoal is a mess.
[3873.45s -> 3876.52s]  Yeah, that one's cool.
[3879.66s -> 3879.98s]  Okay.
[3879.98s -> 3881.18s]  Big top cupcake.
[3883.48s -> 3884.52s]  Perfect meatloaf.
[3884.52s -> 3886.12s]  I'm very curious about perfect meatloaf.
[3889.43s -> 3891.19s]  A flipjack pan.
[3891.19s -> 3894.81s]  Charcoal is the devil's fruit.
[3907.24s -> 3909.85s]  Rip meatloaf.
[3909.85s -> 3910.65s]  Charcoal is.
[3911.37s -> 3916.55s]  Do you want to play postal four?
[3916.55s -> 3917.91s]  I don't, I have no plan to do that.
[3920.52s -> 3921.32s]  Perfect meatloaf.
[3925.56s -> 3927.16s]  No, I'm doing a big top cupcake.
[3927.16s -> 3927.96s]  Cakes aren't cool.
[3927.96s -> 3931.10s]  Why do tiny cupcakes take so long to make?
[3931.10s -> 3932.70s]  This one's frame rate is bad.
[3932.70s -> 3933.90s]  Big top cupcake.
[3933.90s -> 3934.54s]  The fast and.
[3934.54s -> 3935.74s]  We've got this other voice though.
[3936.22s -> 3937.42s]  Cupcakes that are up to.
[3937.42s -> 3938.14s]  What the fuck.
[3938.86s -> 3942.62s]  Everyone's face will light up when you make a king size cupcake house.
[3942.62s -> 3947.02s]  Grab your camera to remember those giant cupcakes your family makes together.
[3947.02s -> 3948.06s]  It's so easy.
[3948.06s -> 3949.58s]  Just fill with any cake mix.
[3950.46s -> 3951.66s]  It's like 100p.
[3951.66s -> 3953.74s]  That jumbo cupcake looks amazing.
[3953.74s -> 3954.30s]  This is a cake.
[3954.30s -> 3958.14s]  Big top's quick release silicone is flexible and virtually nothing sticks.
[3958.14s -> 3959.42s]  It's just a cake though.
[3959.42s -> 3963.18s]  Pops out every time making it the ultimate party activity.
[3963.26s -> 3966.54s]  Mix and match delicious flavors like strawberry and chocolate.
[3968.86s -> 3969.58s]  Oh, what?
[3969.58s -> 3973.98s]  More thrilling than a chocolate filling made easy with our magic center insert.
[3973.98s -> 3976.62s]  Fill big tops with pudding, mousse, gelatin.
[3976.62s -> 3978.30s]  Okay, it's a different product.
[3978.30s -> 3983.26s]  Tiny cupcakes won't do, but 25 times bigger feeds the whole crew.
[3983.26s -> 3984.54s]  No one's going to eat all of it though.
[3985.74s -> 3986.62s]  I might.
[3986.62s -> 3987.12s]  Okay.
[3988.38s -> 3991.34s]  I know, they keep saying that.
[3991.34s -> 3992.54s]  They keep saying that.
[3994.22s -> 3996.30s]  Store-bought cakes are so expensive.
[3996.30s -> 3996.86s]  Are they?
[3996.86s -> 3998.14s]  I don't, I feel like they're not.
[3999.67s -> 4004.12s]  It's a man-sized cupcake.
[4004.12s -> 4007.08s]  Is a cupcake, is a cake that you can buy just at like the store,
[4007.08s -> 4010.68s]  like the grocery store, that expensive?
[4010.68s -> 4013.96s]  I thought that that was like a really good cheap option, isn't it?
[4014.52s -> 4016.02s]  I don't think they're cheap.
[4016.02s -> 4017.30s]  They're not that expensive.
[4018.10s -> 4020.26s]  They're like 10, they're like 15 bucks.
[4024.47s -> 4026.63s]  Oh, it's, it's a, it's a hundred dollars.
[4026.63s -> 4027.83s]  Like what, a hundred?
[4029.03s -> 4030.39s]  Where are you buying these cakes?
[4031.46s -> 4034.58s]  Yeah, they're like 10 to 20 dollars, aren't they?
[4034.58s -> 4041.46s]  But you can join the show now with Big Top Cupcake for the amazingly low price of $19.95.
[4041.46s -> 4043.14s]  It's a man-sized cupcake.
[4043.70s -> 4046.98s]  And to make decorating easy, we'll include this idea book free.
[4046.98s -> 4048.26s]  I love the sound effects.
[4049.38s -> 4049.86s]  Where is it?
[4051.30s -> 4052.42s]  Here it comes right, where is it?
[4052.42s -> 4055.38s]  A few quick steps, fill, bake, and decorate.
[4055.38s -> 4057.46s]  Store-bought cakes are so expensive.
[4057.46s -> 4058.02s]  Where is it?
[4058.02s -> 4060.58s]  Cake mold stick and cost over $35.
[4060.58s -> 4061.78s]  This is like an explosion sound.
[4061.78s -> 4065.38s]  You can join the show now with Big Top Cupcake for the amazingly low price.
[4065.38s -> 4065.70s]  There it is.
[4065.70s -> 4065.86s]  Okay.
[4065.86s -> 4069.46s]  It won't do, but 20 tiny cupcakes won't do, but.
[4072.28s -> 4073.80s]  That's so stupid.
[4073.80s -> 4077.48s]  That's so gross.
[4077.48s -> 4078.28s]  I wouldn't want that.
[4080.25s -> 4082.09s]  But you got to remember like the kid factor, right?
[4082.95s -> 4087.86s]  Kids, a big cupcake to a kid is holy shit.
[4087.86s -> 4089.78s]  This is a huge deal to a kid.
[4089.78s -> 4093.42s]  So a lot of these are like for kids or for seniors.
[4093.74s -> 4097.02s]  You got to keep that in mind.
[4097.02s -> 4097.34s]  All right.
[4097.34s -> 4097.90s]  That was cool.
[4097.90s -> 4099.18s]  What about a perfect meatloaf?
[4099.18s -> 4100.62s]  I think chat's ready for this one.
[4100.62s -> 4102.70s]  Is that crumbly meatloaf a pain to serve?
[4102.70s -> 4105.98s]  Do you hate all the oil, grease, and fat it cooks in?
[4105.98s -> 4107.26s]  There's got to be a better way.
[4108.06s -> 4109.02s]  Hi, it's Mark.
[4109.02s -> 4112.36s]  Hate all.
[4112.36s -> 4112.76s]  Did you?
[4113.80s -> 4116.84s]  Why is there more than like two pizzas worth of grease here?
[4116.84s -> 4117.48s]  What's going on?
[4118.41s -> 4120.25s]  Grease and fat it cooks in?
[4120.25s -> 4121.53s]  There's got to be a better way.
[4122.41s -> 4124.73s]  Hi, it's Mark with the perfect meatloaf pan.
[4124.73s -> 4128.89s]  The new nonstick way to bake, lift, and serve delicious meatloaf.
[4128.89s -> 4129.53s]  Watch.
[4129.53s -> 4131.13s]  Just prepare your favorite loaf.
[4131.13s -> 4133.69s]  Place it on this tray and pop it in the oven.
[4133.69s -> 4136.97s]  When done, simply lift the handles and presto.
[4136.97s -> 4139.77s]  Out comes the entire meatloaf all at once.
[4139.77s -> 4140.49s]  The reason?
[4140.49s -> 4143.13s]  The unique design and durable nonstick coating.
[4143.13s -> 4144.65s]  We haven't gotten the technology.
[4145.53s -> 4148.41s]  Other pans force your meal to sit in a bowl of fat.
[4148.41s -> 4149.61s]  No, it doesn't do that.
[4150.57s -> 4153.37s]  Those same nasty fat drippings stay at the bottom of the pan.
[4153.37s -> 4155.37s]  Okay, what kind of ground beef is this?
[4155.37s -> 4156.86s]  Who wants that?
[4156.86s -> 4158.54s]  This is not 80-20 ground beef.
[4158.54s -> 4162.78s]  This is like 60-40 ground beef.
[4162.78s -> 4167.02s]  With perfect meatloaf, those same nasty fat drippings stay at the bottom of the pan.
[4167.02s -> 4169.66s]  And oh my god.
[4169.66s -> 4172.62s]  Elevated lifting tray with over 60 drain holes.
[4172.62s -> 4176.30s]  Fat drippings can drain through the holes and collect in the space below
[4176.30s -> 4179.42s]  where they won't get reabsorbed back into the meatloaf.
[4179.42s -> 4182.14s]  Lift and serve delicious French onion meatloaf.
[4182.14s -> 4185.66s]  Savory stuffed Italian or moist bacon cheeseburger.
[4185.66s -> 4188.38s]  Perfectly Italian and with all the extra fat.
[4188.38s -> 4189.34s]  Meatloaf sucks.
[4189.34s -> 4190.38s]  But it's not just for meatloaf.
[4190.38s -> 4191.90s]  Baked sticky pecan rolls that lift right out of the pan.
[4191.90s -> 4192.94s]  Meatloaf sucks.
[4192.94s -> 4193.42s]  It just does.
[4193.42s -> 4196.94s]  Or roast and serve soft stuffed peppers without them ever falling apart.
[4196.94s -> 4197.42s]  Holiday serves.
[4197.42s -> 4201.26s]  There's only one meatloaf I've ever had that I liked and it was my mother's meatloaf.
[4201.26s -> 4203.26s]  Nobody else makes it this good.
[4203.26s -> 4207.11s]  And I'll tell you, let's be really honest with each other here.
[4207.11s -> 4208.87s]  I don't like your mother's meatloaf.
[4208.87s -> 4211.27s]  I like my mother's meatloaf.
[4211.27s -> 4215.58s]  Nobody likes another mother's meatloaf.
[4215.58s -> 4217.85s]  I don't like your mother's meatloaf.
[4217.85s -> 4220.01s]  I don't, I'm like, no, I don't like this.
[4220.01s -> 4223.37s]  But if my mom makes it, it's like, mom, it's fantastic.
[4224.49s -> 4227.69s]  Why is that?
[4227.69s -> 4230.73s]  Yeah, your mother's meatloaf is the only good meatloaf.
[4231.29s -> 4233.05s]  Even other mother's meatloafs are not good.
[4233.05s -> 4236.97s]  Perfect meatloaf pan is a tremendous value at just $14.95.
[4236.97s -> 4238.17s]  But I'm not done.
[4238.17s -> 4240.65s]  Call right now and receive this amazing guide knife.
[4240.65s -> 4242.89s]  Adjust to your desired size and slice.
[4242.89s -> 4244.89s]  Thick or thin, you'll always win.
[4244.89s -> 4245.29s]  I like that.
[4245.29s -> 4246.73s]  $20 value, free.
[4246.73s -> 4248.25s]  But I'm not stopping there.
[4248.25s -> 4251.05s]  Collar click right this minute and we'll double your order.
[4251.05s -> 4252.49s]  Just pay separate fucking.
[4252.49s -> 4258.97s]  Hold on a second, I need to, we gotta get, we gotta get that.
[4258.97s -> 4260.81s]  $20 value, free.
[4261.53s -> 4264.57s]  But I'm not stopping there.
[4264.57s -> 4265.45s]  Collar click.
[4267.99s -> 4270.15s]  That was, that was like violent.
[4270.15s -> 4272.39s]  Right this minute and we'll double your order.
[4272.39s -> 4274.31s]  Just pay separate processing and handling.
[4274.31s -> 4274.95s]  I love this guy.
[4274.95s -> 4276.63s]  That's right, you get two perfect meatloaf pans.
[4276.63s -> 4277.67s]  $14.95.
[4278.63s -> 4279.75s]  They're undercutting everybody.
[4284.07s -> 4284.87s]  You get two of them?
[4286.34s -> 4286.66s]  Okay.
[4287.30s -> 4287.94s]  All right.
[4287.94s -> 4292.23s]  That's not bad.
[4292.23s -> 4293.99s]  All right, bacon fill.
[4293.99s -> 4295.67s]  I think we saw that one already, right?
[4295.67s -> 4297.72s]  Flip jack pan.
[4297.72s -> 4302.42s]  We'll do the flip jack pan.
[4302.42s -> 4304.34s]  Pancakes are a pain to flip.
[4304.34s -> 4306.82s]  And half the time they burn and stick.
[4306.82s -> 4307.78s]  Not anymore.
[4307.78s -> 4308.42s]  Introducing.
[4308.42s -> 4309.54s]  It's the same design.
[4309.54s -> 4311.14s]  It's the same fucking design.
[4311.14s -> 4311.70s]  Greenick.
[4311.70s -> 4312.18s]  The easy.
[4312.18s -> 4313.30s]  It's the like turn it.
[4313.30s -> 4313.86s]  With flapjacks.
[4313.86s -> 4314.66s]  It's the turn it.
[4314.66s -> 4316.98s]  Or Greenick ceramic cookwares revolutionized non-stick.
[4316.98s -> 4317.62s]  Sick effect.
[4317.62s -> 4320.42s]  So now with flip jack, just add your favorite batter,
[4320.42s -> 4322.42s]  close the lid, then flip the pan.
[4322.42s -> 4324.74s]  You'll have perfect full-sized flapjacks.
[4324.74s -> 4325.54s]  And check this out.
[4325.54s -> 4327.86s]  We're going to burn a bunch of mozzarella cheese on it
[4327.86s -> 4329.94s]  and it's proof that we can scrape it out into the trash.
[4329.94s -> 4331.30s]  So there's less mess or dress.
[4331.30s -> 4331.86s]  Wait for it.
[4331.86s -> 4333.86s]  Forget about clumsy spatulas.
[4333.86s -> 4335.78s]  Your Greenick flip jack is so easy.
[4335.78s -> 4337.78s]  You'll flip pancakes with just one hand,
[4337.78s -> 4339.62s]  then slide them right out of the pan.
[4339.62s -> 4341.62s]  The secret is the dual hinge cooking design
[4341.62s -> 4343.46s]  with our Greenick ceramic surface.
[4343.54s -> 4344.58s]  Nothing ever sticks.
[4344.58s -> 4345.22s]  What the fuck?
[4346.18s -> 4348.98s]  Burned on cheese slides right off with no...
[4348.98s -> 4349.38s]  Thank you.
[4350.18s -> 4350.74s]  I get a point.
[4352.20s -> 4356.15s]  Um, the, the, what, design.
[4356.15s -> 4357.19s]  Right out of the pan.
[4357.19s -> 4359.51s]  The secret is the dual hinge cooking design with...
[4359.51s -> 4360.95s]  Dual hinge cooking technology.
[4360.95s -> 4362.71s]  They're not using technology anymore.
[4362.71s -> 4363.35s]  What year is this?
[4363.35s -> 4364.95s]  The Greenick ceramic surface.
[4364.95s -> 4366.31s]  Nothing ever sticks.
[4366.31s -> 4369.43s]  Even burned on cheese slides right off with no scrubbing.
[4369.43s -> 4371.27s]  You'll make hot and tasty blueberry
[4371.27s -> 4373.43s]  or a stack of buttermilk in seconds.
[4373.43s -> 4376.07s]  And the kids will love this chocolate chip surprise.
[4376.07s -> 4377.51s]  Oh, I would love that.
[4377.51s -> 4380.95s]  Close the lid, then flip for full-size fantastic flapjacks.
[4380.95s -> 4382.63s]  All without using a spatula.
[4382.63s -> 4384.55s]  Does this ever happen to you?
[4384.55s -> 4385.35s]  Not with flipjack.
[4385.35s -> 4386.15s]  Actually, yeah.
[4386.15s -> 4387.75s]  Over-easy eggs are a cinch.
[4387.75s -> 4390.23s]  And best of all, no broken yolks.
[4390.23s -> 4393.11s]  So call now to get the flipjack pancake pan.
[4393.11s -> 4396.55s]  Here's some inside information from Betty Crocker.
[4396.55s -> 4397.83s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4397.83s -> 4398.31s]  Don't tell me.
[4398.31s -> 4399.74s]  Don't tell me.
[4399.74s -> 4400.86s]  Don't tell me.
[4400.86s -> 4403.83s]  I don't want to know this insider info.
[4404.79s -> 4407.19s]  What if I want to buy shares in Betty Crocker?
[4407.19s -> 4409.26s]  Don't fucking tell me this.
[4409.26s -> 4410.54s]  Hey, I got insider info.
[4410.54s -> 4412.54s]  But don't fucking come near me.
[4412.54s -> 4413.58s]  Get away from me.
[4413.58s -> 4416.94s]  The most exciting thing you can do with the inside of a cake.
[4416.94s -> 4419.74s]  Introducing the Betty Crocker bacon fill.
[4419.74s -> 4422.94s]  A delightful new pan that lets you take care of cake.
[4422.94s -> 4424.70s]  Do we see this already?
[4424.70s -> 4427.58s]  Imagine the look on your child's face when you cut into the cake.
[4427.58s -> 4430.06s]  And there's his favorite flavor of ice cream.
[4430.06s -> 4431.34s]  Her favorite gelatin.
[4431.34s -> 4433.90s]  And who wouldn't enjoy a cake filled with delicious,
[4434.54s -> 4437.02s]  no secret is these three separate sections.
[4437.02s -> 4438.22s]  Then we already did this.
[4438.22s -> 4441.18s]  The same one into the main bacon.
[4441.18s -> 4443.90s]  This is a different commercial for this special inner chamber.
[4443.90s -> 4447.90s]  Now pour more cake mix into this base pan and put them both into.
[4447.90s -> 4448.86s]  Yeah, we've already seen this one.
[4448.86s -> 4449.82s]  Remove the insert.
[4449.82s -> 4451.58s]  Add your filling to the center cavity.
[4451.58s -> 4452.06s]  What is that?
[4452.06s -> 4454.38s]  Cover it with a base in no time.
[4454.38s -> 4456.70s]  You'll have the greatest cake you ever made.
[4456.70s -> 4460.70s]  Making an exciting cake with my Betty Crocker bacon fill is so easy.
[4460.70s -> 4461.98s]  And everything's nonstick.
[4461.98s -> 4463.50s]  So there's no messy cleanup.
[4463.50s -> 4466.78s]  These are the kind of desserts you'll find in the finest restaurants.
[4466.78s -> 4470.54s]  Ice cream cakes, Italian filled torts, even baked Alaska.
[4473.02s -> 4474.38s]  What is baked Alaska?
[4476.09s -> 4484.52s]  Wait, what the fuck is baked Alaska?
[4484.52s -> 4485.32s]  That's scary.
[4485.32s -> 4488.84s]  Or you can simply fill your cake with a different Betty Crocker cake mix.
[4488.84s -> 4489.96s]  Just fill the inner chamber.
[4489.96s -> 4491.48s]  Baked Alaska is on fire?
[4491.48s -> 4493.80s]  Now make all your cakes extra special.
[4493.80s -> 4495.16s]  Make them Betty Crocker bacon filled cakes.
[4495.16s -> 4496.44s]  I didn't know that.
[4496.44s -> 4499.96s]  You'll get the bacon fill pan, the inner chamber, and the base pan.
[4499.96s -> 4503.16s]  Complete with instructions and Betty Crocker recipes.
[4503.16s -> 4504.12s]  All for only $90.
[4504.12s -> 4506.92s]  I don't think it's supposed to be like a raging campfire.
[4506.92s -> 4507.88s]  Or your money back.
[4508.52s -> 4511.86s]  All right, we saw this one already.
[4511.86s -> 4512.90s]  Brownie Derby.
[4513.46s -> 4520.25s]  All right, Brownie Derby sounds pretty great.
[4520.25s -> 4523.11s]  Boring desserts that just fall flat.
[4523.11s -> 4523.75s]  There's only one.
[4523.75s -> 4532.12s]  Juicing the Brownie Derby.
[4532.12s -> 4536.30s]  The incredible Brownie Bowl maker that looks like a hat.
[4536.30s -> 4544.18s]  This, in my opinion, 100% what I believe was a different product.
[4545.56s -> 4549.98s]  That somebody on the board was just like, can we fill it with brownie mix?
[4552.95s -> 4553.75s]  I think so.
[4554.79s -> 4558.55s]  This is, I don't, this looks, this seems like a bizarre product.
[4558.55s -> 4565.03s]  But first of all, this is not a boring dessert.
[4565.03s -> 4568.06s]  This is not enough for three kids.
[4568.06s -> 4575.14s]  If there were three brownies on this plate, they would be cheering.
[4575.14s -> 4576.02s]  Brownies are amazing.
[4576.02s -> 4576.90s]  This is only one.
[4585.53s -> 4587.05s]  Five nights at Freddy's thing.
[4590.33s -> 4591.45s]  What the fuck?
[4591.45s -> 4592.33s]  But who cares?
[4595.03s -> 4595.99s]  Okay, who cares?
[4607.50s -> 4610.14s]  I mean, if you need something to cook a brownie in, then fine.
[4611.67s -> 4612.15s]  That's fine.
[4613.35s -> 4614.65s]  But it's not cool.
[4622.28s -> 4622.52s]  Okay.
[4622.52s -> 4627.64s]  But if you want a brownie that has a hole in it to put ice cream in it, then that makes sense.
[4627.64s -> 4630.50s]  That's the only thing that they had.
[4630.50s -> 4632.50s]  It's not like a fun toy.
[4632.50s -> 4634.26s]  Like they're trying to make, it's just a thing that has a hole.
[4634.26s -> 4635.22s]  It's a brownie with a hole in it.
[4641.02s -> 4641.90s]  Like this makes sense.
[4649.42s -> 4651.74s]  But our man-sized brownie bowl.
[4659.54s -> 4660.26s]  Why do they?
[4663.53s -> 4664.41s]  The same shot.
[4666.17s -> 4667.77s]  Is it the same company?
[4667.77s -> 4668.33s]  It probably is.
[4669.29s -> 4670.33s]  It's the same company.
[4670.33s -> 4670.65s]  Probably.
[4670.65s -> 4671.13s]  It has to be.
[4679.64s -> 4681.32s]  Also, another thing that I have an issue with.
[4682.28s -> 4683.08s]  They always show.
[4684.44s -> 4691.74s]  I don't think this brownie was $80.
[4694.44s -> 4701.26s]  I would be surprised if this was like a $50 to $80 brownie.
[4701.26s -> 4703.66s]  Unless you're at like the fucking weed store.
[4704.30s -> 4706.30s]  Is this an edible brownie?
[4710.49s -> 4715.93s]  Well, dad, you sent in the wrong footage because that is $20 for it.
[4715.93s -> 4718.89s]  I mean, that's not out of the ordinary, I don't think.
[4729.29s -> 4730.09s]  The weed store.
[4730.73s -> 4731.45s]  What the fuck?
[4731.45s -> 4732.41s]  Whose camera is that?
[4732.41s -> 4732.97s]  Is it a kid?
[4741.53s -> 4742.17s]  They knew.
[4742.17s -> 4743.45s]  This was, what year was this?
[4743.45s -> 4745.13s]  This was probably like 2005.
[4746.41s -> 4747.29s]  They knew it was coming.
[4758.98s -> 4760.50s]  Oh, the tip the hat.
[4761.30s -> 4761.78s]  I like that.
[4761.78s -> 4762.90s]  That was a nice touch.
[4762.90s -> 4769.03s]  That was a nice touch.
[4769.03s -> 4771.00s]  Yeah, that was a nice touch.
[4771.00s -> 4772.04s]  Now, how about magic meal?
[4783.75s -> 4784.15s]  I don't know.
[4784.15s -> 4785.67s]  It's so bit rate is so bad.
[4785.67s -> 4786.31s]  I can't even tell.
[4791.51s -> 4792.07s]  Spaghetti.
[4799.35s -> 4803.59s]  All right, but I got to be centrist Andy here.
[4803.59s -> 4805.27s]  I got to be centrist Andy.
[4805.27s -> 4806.31s]  I got to be a centrist.
[4812.79s -> 4814.07s]  I wouldn't put clams in the microwave.
[4817.67s -> 4818.31s]  I don't think so.
[4819.35s -> 4819.91s]  I don't think so.
[4824.63s -> 4825.35s]  I don't think so.
[4825.35s -> 4826.87s]  Plus store leftovers in the fridge.
[4826.87s -> 4829.51s]  And by the way, does it have to look like a fucking urn?
[4829.51s -> 4831.35s]  Easy reheating and it's dish.
[4831.35s -> 4832.95s]  Like it just looks like an urn.
[4832.95s -> 4833.99s]  Frozen to defrost.
[4833.99s -> 4836.15s]  Oh, what?
[4836.15s -> 4838.63s]  Imagine perfectly cooked juicy chicken
[4838.63s -> 4839.91s]  right from your microwave.
[4839.91s -> 4841.91s]  Simply unlock and twist.
[4841.91s -> 4843.19s]  What the fuck?
[4843.19s -> 4844.71s]  Right from the bottom veggies.
[4844.71s -> 4846.23s]  It's like the right crunch.
[4846.23s -> 4849.03s]  Enjoy healthy fish and hearty nutritious soups.
[4849.03s -> 4850.87s]  Even rinse and serve a healthy salad.
[4850.87s -> 4852.15s]  I have no commentary for this one.

[4870.14s -> 4871.66s]  That's impossible in a microwave.
[4871.66s -> 4872.94s]  You can't, that can't happen.
[4876.71s -> 4877.67s]  In minutes?

[4962.10s -> 4963.38s]  Who has two microwaves?
[4964.10s -> 4968.10s]  This thing, obviously from the commercial, fills the whole microwave.
[4968.10s -> 4972.90s]  Did anybody have more than one microwave in their house or in their apartment?
[4972.90s -> 4975.30s]  Like who has like two full-size microwaves?
[4975.30s -> 4981.30s]  Just do it, but you can't just dump this out and clean it and do it again.

[5047.93s -> 5049.29s]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[5049.29s -> 5051.45s]  Everybody back up and everybody shut up for a second.
[5052.58s -> 5053.30s]  This is not-
[5053.86s -> 5058.66s]  I've seen products like this where you-
[5058.66s -> 5060.66s]  Oh, look, you make perfect little patties.
[5062.49s -> 5063.53s]  But then you have to cook them.
[5064.09s -> 5066.17s]  This is a pan.
[5069.29s -> 5069.79s]  No way.
[5072.70s -> 5073.20s]  What?
[5085.21s -> 5085.71s]  Yeah, yeah.
[5093.08s -> 5093.80s]  Burnt on cheese.
[5102.50s -> 5104.42s]  And they always make the pans look so dirty.
[5111.02s -> 5112.62s]  Oh, that's fucking awesome.
[5115.62s -> 5116.12s]  Whoa.
[5117.77s -> 5118.65s]  Bagel sandwiches?
[5121.53s -> 5122.25s]  Bro, I'm sorry.
[5122.25s -> 5122.97s]  I would want this.
[5122.97s -> 5123.47s]  I'd get it.
[5127.24s -> 5128.28s]  I don't care what anybody says.
[5138.28s -> 5139.56s]  The double decker.
[5139.56s -> 5141.08s]  The blue cheese bomber.
[5141.08s -> 5142.36s]  The buffalo chicken burger.
[5142.36s -> 5144.84s]  Oh, couldn't come up with one for that one.

[5173.99s -> 5174.63s]  Dope.
[5174.63s -> 5176.82s]  What is that?
[5176.82s -> 5178.02s]  Chopped grilled onions?
[5178.02s -> 5180.10s]  Ketchup mustard slice of American cheese on a patty?
[5180.66s -> 5181.77s]  Looks dope.
[5181.77s -> 5182.73s]  Don't say dope.
[5182.73s -> 5183.23s]  Okay.
[5191.53s -> 5192.03s]  All right.
[5193.69s -> 5194.33s]  Can that do butter?
[5196.01s -> 5197.62s]  Crab slicer.
[5197.62s -> 5199.38s]  Here's how you can call or log on.
[5199.38s -> 5200.18s]  1999.
[5200.18s -> 5200.66s]  There it is.
[5200.66s -> 5201.38s]  All right, that's-
[5201.38s -> 5201.86s]  I love it.
[5202.42s -> 5203.34s]  I would get-
[5203.34s -> 5205.10s]  Okay, there's two or three that I would get.
[5205.10s -> 5210.62s]  How about shake and take my blend buddy?
[5210.62s -> 5211.42s]  That's a long name.
[5214.76s -> 5216.44s]  Okay, blenders actually are a pain in the ass.
[5216.44s -> 5219.00s]  So I will give this one a little bit of time here.
[5219.00s -> 5221.56s]  Hate fussing with the blunders of blenders.
[5221.56s -> 5223.16s]  Especially when you're on the go.
[5223.16s -> 5226.04s]  Then searching for a portable cop and messy cleanups.
[5226.68s -> 5228.04s]  Well, now there's blend buddy.
[5228.04s -> 5232.04s]  The world's only blender that mixes right inside a portable sports bottle.
[5232.04s -> 5234.52s]  So you'll always have a quick new blend buddy.
[5234.52s -> 5235.02s]  Wait.
[5236.36s -> 5236.86s]  Hold on.
[5241.80s -> 5242.68s]  Where's her other hand?
[5245.03s -> 5246.39s]  Where's your other hand?
[5246.39s -> 5247.59s]  It's not holding anything.
[5248.71s -> 5251.77s]  She's got a purse around the shoulder.
[5251.77s -> 5252.97s]  Her other hand is free.
[5255.21s -> 5256.33s]  Why don't you use the other hand?
[5257.59s -> 5259.11s]  Well, now there's blend buddy.
[5259.11s -> 5263.11s]  The world's only blender that mixes right inside a portable sports bottle.
[5263.11s -> 5266.55s]  So you'll always have a quick meal ready fast and easy.
[5266.55s -> 5268.39s]  Just fill with your favorite fruits.
[5268.39s -> 5269.11s]  Press the button.
[5269.11s -> 5269.59s]  Phone.
[5269.59s -> 5270.87s]  Oh, up like this.
[5270.87s -> 5273.75s]  Your delicious blueberry smoothie is ready to go.
[5273.75s -> 5274.31s]  Then simply-
[5274.31s -> 5275.43s]  Oh, then it's a container.
[5277.35s -> 5278.71s]  Yeah, but the magic bullet did this.
[5279.99s -> 5281.51s]  The magic bullet did this already.
[5281.51s -> 5283.35s]  Even the mixing blades are attached.
[5283.35s -> 5284.79s]  So there's no extra parts.
[5284.79s -> 5288.39s]  The large 16-ounce container will satisfy the biggest thirst.
[5288.39s -> 5289.19s]  Man-sized.
[5290.07s -> 5292.07s]  And not only is it man-sized, but look at this.
[5292.07s -> 5294.09s]  This man's out working.
[5294.09s -> 5294.81s]  Construction.
[5296.20s -> 5297.56s]  Large for a man.
[5297.56s -> 5300.01s]  Satisfy the biggest thirst.
[5300.01s -> 5304.01s]  And because it's dishwasher safe, blending a drink won't fill your sink.
[5304.01s -> 5305.05s]  But the best part-
[5305.05s -> 5306.49s]  A man-sized thirst.
[5306.49s -> 5312.09s]  20,000 RPMs of power pulverizes frozen fruits, ice, and nuts into smooth, creamy drinks.
[5312.09s -> 5313.21s]  Guaranteed.
[5313.21s -> 5316.81s]  Not that you would, but even solid rock is turned into a fine powder.
[5316.81s -> 5317.61s]  That's broken now.
[5317.61s -> 5320.33s]  GlenBuddy is perfect for executives with busy schedules.
[5320.33s -> 5320.89s]  Executive.
[5320.89s -> 5321.85s]  A must for moths.
[5321.85s -> 5325.61s]  GlenBuddy is perfect for executives, but even solid rock is turned into a fine powder.
[5325.61s -> 5326.65s]  Is that a wedding ring?
[5327.77s -> 5328.89s]  That's a huge ring.
[5328.89s -> 5329.69s]  Is that a wedding ring?
[5332.02s -> 5339.86s]  That's a big wedding ring?
[5339.86s -> 5344.74s]  Is it executive?
[5344.74s -> 5345.70s]  No, it's not, right?
[5346.26s -> 5349.06s]  What size does a wedding ring have to be on?
[5349.06s -> 5356.63s]  That's a man-sized wedding ring.
[5356.63s -> 5359.51s]  Is perfect for executives with-
[5359.51s -> 5360.31s]  Executives.
[5360.87s -> 5362.81s]  I love its executives.
[5362.81s -> 5363.61s]  Oh, it's perfect.
[5363.61s -> 5365.61s]  It's perfect for an executive with a briefcase.
[5369.83s -> 5370.63s]  This executive?
[5374.22s -> 5376.14s]  Where is this executive, by the way?
[5376.14s -> 5378.06s]  Does he live here?
[5378.06s -> 5379.18s]  Is this another person's house?
[5382.74s -> 5383.86s]  Who is the exec-
[5383.86s -> 5385.06s]  Perfect for the executive.
[5387.21s -> 5391.54s]  Because they've shown us the same people the whole time, right?
[5391.54s -> 5393.14s]  Is this the same family?
[5396.74s -> 5397.54s]  It's the same kitchen.
[5398.36s -> 5400.20s]  Oh no, it's not the same kitchen, okay.
[5400.28s -> 5401.48s]  I thought it was the same kitchen.
[5403.27s -> 5404.23s]  I thought it was the same kitchen.
[5405.19s -> 5407.35s]  Because I was going to say, are they all living in the same house?
[5410.71s -> 5412.95s]  Because they showed, like, construction worker guy.
[5412.95s -> 5413.59s]  Executive.
[5414.55s -> 5415.91s]  Mom, I'm guessing, right?
[5415.91s -> 5418.55s]  Like, I thought they were all going to be in the same house.
[5424.55s -> 5425.19s]  The Sims.
[5431.35s -> 5436.47s]  Oh, executive-sized thirst.
[5442.95s -> 5443.51s]  These are kind of-
[5451.83s -> 5452.71s]  That wouldn't be a bad gift.
[5456.79s -> 5458.07s]  That's not a bad gift, I don't think.
[5458.07s -> 5460.79s]  Like, that's a cool prio-centrist-
[5460.79s -> 5461.59s]  Whatever.
[5461.59s -> 5464.07s]  All right, how about the potato express?
[5472.39s -> 5472.89s]  What?
[5474.79s -> 5475.91s]  Holy shit!
[5477.43s -> 5481.77s]  I didn't even think this was a potato.
[5481.77s -> 5484.17s]  Oh my god, what happened to this?
[5486.33s -> 5490.42s]  This looks like a-
[5490.42s -> 5492.50s]  That's like, that's plastic or something.
[5494.01s -> 5495.85s]  A potato doesn't do that in the microwave.
[5497.93s -> 5498.97s]  45 minutes?
[5500.73s -> 5509.40s]  Did they fuck this up, and does this person not understand that it's 45 minutes in the oven,
[5509.40s -> 5512.12s]  and not 45 minutes in the microwave?
[5523.80s -> 5524.30s]  Whoa.
[5524.30s -> 5531.58s]  All right, what is that?
[5537.90s -> 5538.70s]  What the fuck?
[5540.78s -> 5542.78s]  The insulation steam pocket technology.
[5543.42s -> 5546.06s]  All right, this is high-tech.
[5548.06s -> 5550.06s]  Why are they putting it in an oven mitt?
[5550.06s -> 5552.06s]  It's not an oven mitt.
[5552.06s -> 5554.06s]  It's not an oven mitt.
[5554.06s -> 5556.06s]  It's not an oven mitt.
[5556.06s -> 5556.86s]  It's something, it don't-
[5556.86s -> 5558.86s]  I'm telling you, there's something in there that makes it microwave safe.
[5572.78s -> 5574.78s]  Delicious potato salad ever.
[5574.78s -> 5579.02s]  Use potato express for super quick home fries for a gourmet breakfast.
[5579.02s -> 5582.22s]  Potato express will save you time when making mashed potatoes-
[5582.22s -> 5583.26s]  Sugar and mar- I don't know.
[5583.26s -> 5584.78s]  Or present tender potato skins.
[5584.78s -> 5588.22s]  Machine washable and reusable over and over again.
[5588.22s -> 5590.54s]  Stop wasting time baking potatoes in the-
[5590.54s -> 5592.78s]  Stop opening the oven when you're cooking food.
[5592.78s -> 5593.90s]  Maybe that would help that-
[5593.90s -> 5596.38s]  You know why it takes you 45 minutes to cook a potato?
[5596.38s -> 5599.34s]  Because you go like this every fucking two minutes.
[5599.34s -> 5599.98s]  Leave it alone.
[5600.62s -> 5603.02s]  Call now and get potato express complete-
[5603.02s -> 5603.74s]  And they just sit in-
[5603.74s -> 5605.02s]  Stop wasting time-
[5605.02s -> 5607.74s]  Did you just put three baked potatoes on the rack?
[5610.38s -> 5611.26s]  Stop opening the oven.
[5611.26s -> 5611.90s]  In the oven.

[5633.26s -> 5634.62s]  All for just $10.
[5635.42s -> 5636.86s]  So wait, you actually have this?
[5637.50s -> 5638.06s]  Does it work?
[5640.11s -> 5640.91s]  If it works, it works.
[5640.91s -> 5641.63s]  That's why I-
[5641.63s -> 5642.19s]  I don't want to-
[5642.19s -> 5644.91s]  Look, talking shit about these like commercials, sure, right?
[5644.91s -> 5645.87s]  We can do that.
[5645.87s -> 5649.56s]  But if they work as advertised and they're useful-
[5652.44s -> 5653.00s]  Good.
[5653.00s -> 5653.80s]  All right.
[5653.80s -> 5654.52s]  It works.
[5654.52s -> 5655.48s]  My friend has one of these.
[5655.48s -> 5656.04s]  It works.
[5656.04s -> 5656.60s]  And then it works.
[5657.24s -> 5658.04s]  Who cares?
[5658.04s -> 5658.68s]  There's no problem.
[5660.46s -> 5662.22s]  I am so ready for the Hulk grill
[5662.22s -> 5664.62s]  because it's going to be a ton of man-sized portions.
[5664.62s -> 5666.30s]  You've tried other grills on the market.
[5666.30s -> 5667.66s]  Some of them may drain the grease,
[5667.66s -> 5668.86s]  but don't cook the meat even-
[5668.86s -> 5669.10s]  Is that-
[5669.10s -> 5670.14s]  Is that Hulk Hogan?
[5670.94s -> 5674.06s]  Now you can enjoy juicy cooked burgers grilled to perfection.
[5674.06s -> 5676.38s]  Grilled cheese sandwiches in just 30 seconds.
[5676.38s -> 5679.34s]  Homemade golden brown Belgian waffles in just minutes.
[5679.34s -> 5679.90s]  Why was it-
[5679.90s -> 5680.54s]  Delicious panini sandwiches in five minutes.
[5680.54s -> 5681.82s]  Why did they use Hulk Hogan?
[5681.82s -> 5684.38s]  Fresh or frozen pizza baked in 15 minutes.
[5684.38s -> 5686.70s]  Amazing quesadillas in only two minutes.
[5686.70s -> 5688.38s]  Plump and juicy hot dogs.
[5688.38s -> 5690.22s]  Amazing thick cut frozen steaks-
[5690.22s -> 5691.50s]  Is Hulk Hogan in the commercial?
[5691.50s -> 5693.58s]  ...perfection in only 20 minutes.
[5693.58s -> 5695.02s]  Even delicious desserts.
[5695.02s -> 5695.58s]  And your kids-
[5695.58s -> 5696.38s]  Hulk size.
[5696.38s -> 5697.02s]  ...will look like this.
[5697.02s -> 5698.78s]  Oh my god.
[5698.78s -> 5700.06s]  ...lives up to its name.
[5700.06s -> 5701.10s]  The Hulk Hogan?
[5701.10s -> 5702.46s]  Hulk Hogan's ultimate grill.
[5702.46s -> 5703.66s]  This is George Foreman.
[5703.66s -> 5705.90s]  Because its extra large interchangeable plates
[5705.90s -> 5708.46s]  easily transforms your Hulk Hogan grill into a skillet.
[5708.46s -> 5709.74s]  This is George Foreman grill.
[5709.74s -> 5710.78s]  The Hulk Hogan grill?
[5710.78s -> 5712.14s]  Pizza oven.
[5712.14s -> 5712.46s]  What?
[5712.46s -> 5713.58s]  Quesadilla maker.
[5713.58s -> 5714.86s]  A buffet warmer.
[5714.86s -> 5715.82s]  And then some.
[5715.82s -> 5718.62s]  That's $1,200 worth of specialty appliances
[5718.62s -> 5721.10s]  in just one countertop rebel-
[5721.18s -> 5723.66s]  I thought he was going to say twelve hundred appliances.
[5725.87s -> 5726.43s]  Okay, what is it?
[5726.43s -> 5726.83s]  What is it?
[5726.83s -> 5727.79s]  This is a fry-
[5727.79s -> 5730.24s]  No, this is like a serving tray.
[5730.24s -> 5732.08s]  Twelve hundred appliances.
[5732.08s -> 5733.36s]  ...a buffet warmer.
[5733.36s -> 5734.32s]  And then some.
[5734.32s -> 5737.12s]  That's $1,200 worth of specialty appliances
[5737.12s -> 5738.48s]  in just one countertop rebel-
[5738.48s -> 5739.52s]  And it's Hulk size.
[5739.52s -> 5740.48s]  Not even man size.
[5740.48s -> 5743.52s]  Best of all, the food is filled with ultimate flavor.
[5743.52s -> 5746.56s]  The secret is the ultimate grill cooks with mechanical pressure.
[5746.56s -> 5749.04s]  Just lock the lid, instantly searing in flavor-
[5749.04s -> 5749.84s]  Why is he here?
[5751.20s -> 5752.00s]  Why is he here?
[5752.00s -> 5753.20s]  ...sides every time.
[5753.20s -> 5753.84s]  Plus with its-
[5753.84s -> 5755.92s]  We better get like a 30-second monologue
[5755.92s -> 5757.28s]  of him looking right in the camera.
[5757.28s -> 5758.32s]  Let me tell you something, brother.
[5759.04s -> 5760.32s]  The Hulk Hogan grill.
[5760.32s -> 5761.28s]  It's got the healthiest-
[5761.28s -> 5762.40s]  Yeah, please do it.
[5762.40s -> 5764.16s]  ...way to the self-contained fat trapper.
[5764.16s -> 5766.24s]  The unique floating hinge allows the ultimate grill
[5766.24s -> 5767.84s]  to adjust to the size of the food,
[5767.84s -> 5770.16s]  so it's cooked to perfection every time.
[5770.16s -> 5771.68s]  Just the way you like it.
[5771.68s -> 5774.72s]  Grill Hulk-size chops, steaks, chicken, and fish.
[5774.72s -> 5775.20s]  Open it up-
[5775.20s -> 5777.20s]  You don't have Hulk Hogan on the thing
[5777.20s -> 5779.20s]  if he doesn't say something monologue for ten seconds.
[5779.20s -> 5781.76s]  ...ultimate grill turns into the ultimate panini sandwich
[5782.08s -> 5783.60s]  to make grilled turkey paninis.
[5783.60s -> 5785.04s]  Make a quick and healthy lunch for you-
[5785.04s -> 5786.64s]  I thought that was Hulk Hogan for a second.
[5786.64s -> 5789.20s]  ...heat settings allow you to cook different foods at the same time.
[5789.20s -> 5792.24s]  Cook bacon, sausages, or other breakfast meats on the grill plate
[5792.24s -> 5795.20s]  while the excess grease drains into the self-contained fat trapper.
[5795.20s -> 5798.24s]  Seafood is perfect to cook on Hulk Hogan's ultimate grill.
[5798.24s -> 5800.24s]  You can easily cook swordfish on one side,
[5800.24s -> 5802.00s]  scallops and shrimp kebabs on the other.
[5802.00s -> 5804.56s]  Close the grill and cook delicious savory salmon.
[5804.56s -> 5807.20s]  Grill large chicken breasts while keeping them plump and juicy-
[5807.20s -> 5810.64s]  They showed him eating half a hot dog in one bite and that's it.
[5810.64s -> 5811.60s]  ...serve with grilled vegetables.
[5811.76s -> 5813.84s]  Take the leftover chicken, add a tortilla,
[5813.84s -> 5816.32s]  and you've got amazing fresh quesadillas.
[5816.32s -> 5817.60s]  Hulk Hogan's ultimate grill-
[5817.60s -> 5818.40s]  Where is he?
[5818.40s -> 5821.84s]  ...you're on a special diet, whether it's high protein or vegetarian.
[5821.84s -> 5824.08s]  Stir-fry all your vegetables on one side.
[5824.08s -> 5826.08s]  At the same time, you can heat up your rice.
[5826.08s -> 5828.40s]  Place a large, fresh, or frozen pizza on the skillet,
[5828.40s -> 5832.80s]  and in just 15 minutes, you've got a mouth-watering, gourmet, crispy pizza.
[5832.80s -> 5834.88s]  Best of all, cleanup is a breeze.
[5834.88s -> 5837.20s]  Just put the self-contained no-spill fat trapper
[5837.20s -> 5838.80s]  in cooking plates in the dishwasher.
[5838.80s -> 5840.00s]  It's that easy.
[5840.08s -> 5841.68s]  Hulk Hogan's ultimate grill-
[5841.68s -> 5842.88s]  He's not here!
[5842.88s -> 5846.16s]  ...apartments, dorm rooms, RVs, boats, and so much more.
[5849.69s -> 5850.17s]  That's it?
[5850.89s -> 5851.45s]  That's it?
[5852.84s -> 5853.64s]  No way!
[5854.44s -> 5855.72s]  What the fuck?
[5855.72s -> 5860.44s]  He's just a gif in the corner and they showed him biting into a hot dog.
[5862.92s -> 5863.88s]  He didn't do anything.
[5864.60s -> 5866.20s]  He didn't do anything but this.
[5866.20s -> 5868.68s]  ...the food is filled with ultimate flavor.
[5868.68s -> 5869.80s]  The secret is the ultimate-
[5870.60s -> 5872.36s]  He just bit into a hot dog.
[5873.80s -> 5875.32s]  Maybe there's a 30-minute version?
[5876.20s -> 5878.68s]  I hope there is, because holy shit, that's so funny.
[5879.88s -> 5881.80s]  But even if this is the short version,
[5883.80s -> 5886.60s]  you're not going to have Hulk Hogan doing anything besides bite a hot dog
[5886.60s -> 5889.53s]  in your two- three-minute spot?
[5889.53s -> 5893.12s]  Your three-minute spot has him biting a hot dog.
[5893.12s -> 5894.56s]  You've got to have him being like,
[5894.56s -> 5896.48s]  oh, this is- I'm telling you something, this is really good.
[5896.48s -> 5898.00s]  It's very flavorful, very healthy.
[5898.00s -> 5898.96s]  You've got to get him to talk.
[5899.52s -> 5900.48s]  That's it?
[5900.48s -> 5903.48s]  There's definitely got to be a 30-minute version.
[5904.84s -> 5907.93s]  When you make merch for-
[5907.93s -> 5908.99s]  Listen to me.
[5908.99s -> 5913.68s]  When you make merch for your commercial,
[5913.68s -> 5916.51s]  it's going to be a 30-minute spot.
[5916.51s -> 5916.99s]  No way.
[5916.99s -> 5918.03s]  This is the three minutes.
[5919.23s -> 5923.36s]  All right.
[5923.36s -> 5926.00s]  How about the Fresh Mex Express?
[5927.45s -> 5929.61s]  You love a delicious Mexican fiesta?
[5929.61s -> 5930.49s]  Yes, I do.
[5930.49s -> 5931.53s]  Salsa, guacamole-
[5931.53s -> 5932.33s]  Bring it on.
[5932.33s -> 5935.53s]  ...but chopping, slicing, mixing, it's a chore.
[5935.53s -> 5937.85s]  Hi, David Jones here with Fresh Mex Express.
[5937.85s -> 5938.33s]  David Jones.
[5938.33s -> 5942.97s]  ...the fast, easy way to make guacamole, salsa, and more in seconds.
[5942.97s -> 5943.45s]  Watch.
[5943.45s -> 5946.01s]  Just add tomatoes, onions, and cilantro.
[5946.01s -> 5946.97s]  Put the lid on.
[5946.97s -> 5948.17s]  Give it a couple of turns.
[5948.17s -> 5951.61s]  In less than five seconds, you have unbelievable fresh salsa.
[5951.61s -> 5952.97s]  I don't know, but I don't know.
[5952.97s -> 5954.49s]  I don't know if this is a new character.
[5955.74s -> 5956.54s]  David Jones?
[5957.63s -> 5958.03s]  I don't know.
[5958.03s -> 5959.07s]  I don't like new characters.
[5959.07s -> 5959.87s]  I don't like new things.
[5964.41s -> 5966.81s]  Maybe we'll warm up to him.
[5966.81s -> 5967.29s]  Easy.
[5967.29s -> 5969.93s]  Take some avocados, onions, cilantro,
[5969.93s -> 5973.37s]  for a full bowl of guacamole in just five seconds.
[5973.37s -> 5974.57s]  That was way more than five seconds.
[5974.57s -> 5979.69s]  ...the three ultra-sharp stainless steel blades that chop, mix, and prep in just one step.
[5979.69s -> 5984.25s]  Thick, medium, or finely chopped with Fresh Mex Express, the choice is yours.
[5984.25s -> 5984.65s]  This is fucking stupid.
[5984.65s -> 5990.09s]  Make a spicy guacamole, mouth-watering mango salsa, creamy chili cheese dip,
[5990.09s -> 5994.41s]  flavorful black bean dip, even make fresh, healthy hummus, and-
[5994.41s -> 5995.53s]  What the fuck?
[5995.53s -> 5996.65s]  ...nothing's better.
[5996.65s -> 5997.77s]  Top burritos with guacamole-
[5997.77s -> 5998.65s]  I can't, man.
[5998.65s -> 6000.17s]  This is fucking so dumb.
[6000.17s -> 6003.05s]  ...make cheesy steak fajitas, load up nachos,
[6003.85s -> 6007.45s]  that bulky food processor is a pain and takes forever to clean,
[6007.45s -> 6011.85s]  but Fresh Mex Express chops, mixes, and serves in the same bowl,
[6011.85s -> 6013.61s]  and it's dishwasher safe.
[6013.61s -> 6018.01s]  Now get Fresh Mex Express complete with our South of the Border Recipe Guide for just-

[6030.01s -> 6036.28s]  They keep playing the same 10-minute clip.
[6037.60s -> 6039.44s]  The same 10-minute music file.
[6039.44s -> 6040.96s]  It's like, oh, come on, man.
[6041.84s -> 6043.36s]  You don't got anything else to put here?
[6043.36s -> 6045.36s]  ...stackable storage lid to save tasty leftovers-

[6065.92s -> 6068.96s]  ...and the Tortilla Express for just $19.99.
[6068.96s -> 6069.20s]  All right.
[6069.20s -> 6070.72s]  What if it might be fun?
[6070.72s -> 6072.16s]  If it's doable to work with the kids.
[6072.80s -> 6074.08s]  We found the Hulk one.
[6074.08s -> 6074.88s]  All right, hold on.
[6080.22s -> 6080.86s]  All right.
[6080.86s -> 6083.26s]  Let me- I gotta go pee.
[6083.26s -> 6084.46s]  I'll be right back.
[6091.85s -> 6093.53s]  Try modulating video speed.
[6098.94s -> 6099.34s]  I'll be back.
[6099.34s -> 6100.22s]  I gotta pee.
[6100.22s -> 6101.84s]  We'll be back with more.
[6101.84s -> 6103.04s]  I'll put the Hulk one on.
[6103.04s -> 6479.31s]  Oh, shit.
[6479.31s -> 6481.23s]  I forgot the- Oh, well.
[6481.23s -> 6481.55s]  Oops.
[6482.27s -> 6484.22s]  All right.
[6484.22s -> 6488.68s]  Where's the link to the-
[6488.68s -> 6493.96s]  Okay, we got it in the mods gave to me.
[6493.96s -> 6494.76s]  Is this the whole thing?
[6504.33s -> 6504.73s]  Yep.
[6504.73s -> 6505.69s]  28 minutes.
[6505.69s -> 6509.13s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[6509.13s -> 6511.69s]  The following is a paid for the Hulk Hogan Ultimate Grill.
[6513.68s -> 6517.74s]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[6517.74s -> 6518.06s]  Okay.
[6519.10s -> 6520.22s]  Let me just pull this.
[6522.11s -> 6528.12s]  So this is the Hulk Hogan Ultimate Grill.
[6528.12s -> 6530.52s]  It's probably going to be in like 140p.
[6530.52s -> 6531.72s]  Just to let everybody know.
[6531.72s -> 6535.32s]  Come back over here.
[6538.03s -> 6538.83s]  We're not going to watch the whole thing.
[6541.04s -> 6541.68s]  Maybe we will.
[6541.68s -> 6542.64s]  Let's find out.
[6542.64s -> 6546.33s]  You guys ready?
[6546.33s -> 6547.29s]  The following is-
[6547.29s -> 6551.69s]  That was very loud.
[6551.69s -> 6554.09s]  Paid advertisement for Hulk Hogan's Ultimate Grill.
[6554.09s -> 6556.09s]  Brought to you by TriStar Products Incorporated.
[6556.09s -> 6556.33s]  All right.
[6556.33s -> 6556.89s]  Let's go.
[6556.89s -> 6557.61s]  Hey, guys.
[6557.61s -> 6558.81s]  I'm Hulk Hogan.
[6558.81s -> 6560.65s]  Stay with me for the next half hour.
[6560.65s -> 6562.33s]  I'm going to show you my latest invention.
[6563.45s -> 6564.33s]  My invention.
[6567.13s -> 6569.69s]  Finally, a grill that lives up to its name.
[6569.69s -> 6571.45s]  Hulk Hogan's Ultimate Grill.
[6571.45s -> 6572.57s]  It's the ultimate because-
[6572.57s -> 6572.89s]  Okay.
[6572.89s -> 6575.85s]  The large interchangeable plates easily transforms your-
[6575.85s -> 6576.09s]  You know what?
[6576.09s -> 6577.93s]  They definitely were just like,
[6577.93s -> 6580.64s]  Hey, Hulk, Hulk Hogan.
[6580.64s -> 6585.36s]  We're going to run the camera for three minutes.
[6585.36s -> 6586.24s]  And just do whatever you want.
[6586.24s -> 6588.40s]  Do like three or four promos.
[6588.40s -> 6589.85s]  And you can literally say anything you want.
[6589.85s -> 6590.81s]  Just kind of flex and shit.
[6590.81s -> 6593.07s]  And we're just going to put you around the commercial.
[6593.07s -> 6595.84s]  And then I think he's in person here.
[6595.84s -> 6596.56s]  This is important.
[6596.56s -> 6597.44s]  To a skillet.
[6597.44s -> 6598.40s]  Panini sandwich press.
[6598.40s -> 6599.04s]  He made this.
[6599.04s -> 6599.84s]  Pizza oven.
[6599.84s -> 6600.48s]  And then some-
[6600.48s -> 6601.36s]  No, he did not.
[6601.36s -> 6602.32s]  Ultimate Grill cooks with mechanical pressure-
[6602.32s -> 6604.32s]  George Foreman did 10 years before this.
[6604.32s -> 6604.40s]  Just like the lid.
[6604.40s -> 6606.32s]  Instantly searing in flavor and juices.
[6606.32s -> 6609.92s]  You have evenly perfectly grilled food on both sides every time.
[6609.92s -> 6612.16s]  Plus with its two huge cooking surfaces,
[6612.16s -> 6615.68s]  along with the dual variable heat settings from 210 to 425 degrees,
[6615.68s -> 6617.44s]  you can easily cook healthy meals.
[6617.44s -> 6621.12s]  While excess fat drips away into the self-contained fat trapper.
[6621.12s -> 6623.92s]  Just remove it, empty it, and put it in the dishwasher.
[6623.92s -> 6627.52s]  The unique floating hinge allows the Ultimate Grill to adjust to the size of the food.
[6627.52s -> 6628.48s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[6628.48s -> 6628.96s]  Excuse me.
[6628.96s -> 6630.96s]  I- Men don't like healthy things.
[6630.96s -> 6634.72s]  We like chicken, cheese, bacon, and cheeseburgers.
[6634.72s -> 6636.96s]  Grilled cheese sandwiches in just 30 seconds.
[6636.96s -> 6640.00s]  Homemade golden brown Belgian waffles in just minutes.
[6640.00s -> 6642.48s]  Delicious panini sandwiches in five minutes.
[6642.48s -> 6645.04s]  Pressure frozen pizza baked in 15 minutes.
[6645.04s -> 6647.36s]  Amazing quesadillas in only two minutes.
[6647.36s -> 6648.32s]  And coffee.
[6648.32s -> 6649.04s]  Juicy hot dogs.
[6649.04s -> 6654.48s]  Amazing thick cut frozen steaks cooked to mouthwatering perfection in only 20 minutes.
[6654.48s -> 6655.04s]  20 minutes?
[6655.04s -> 6655.60s]  Even delicious desserts.
[6655.60s -> 6658.08s]  And your kitchen doesn't have to look like this.
[6658.08s -> 6658.56s]  Stay tuned to discover how you can replace over time.
[6658.56s -> 6662.00s]  You stood from the back of the room and threw those puffs into the sink.
[6662.00s -> 6665.12s]  With just one countertop wonder that's simple to use,
[6665.12s -> 6668.48s]  simple to clean, and is as easy to store as a box of cereal.
[6668.48s -> 6673.36s]  Here's our host, Bob Wharton, and the man who demanded the Ultimate Grilling Machine.
[6673.60s -> 6678.88s]  To discover how you can replace over $1,200 of appliances with just one countertop wonder
[6678.88s -> 6683.36s]  that's simple to use, simple to clean, and is as easy to store as a box of cereal.
[6684.88s -> 6687.84s]  Who's putting a box of cereal down here?
[6687.84s -> 6690.96s]  And is as easy to store as a box of cereal.
[6690.96s -> 6692.96s]  Why are you hiding this in like a safe down here?
[6693.68s -> 6694.80s]  A box of cereal?
[6694.80s -> 6697.28s]  Here's our host, Bob Wharton, and the man who demanded the Ultimate Grilling Machine.
[6697.28s -> 6699.52s]  Oh, the man who demanded the Ultimate Grill.
[6699.52s -> 6705.26s]  Finally, we've come up with a grill that lives up to its name.
[6705.26s -> 6709.58s]  It's the Ultimate Grill, and it's definitely the Ultimate Cooking Appliance.
[6709.58s -> 6712.46s]  And we promised everyone that they'd love my grill so much.
[6712.46s -> 6714.62s]  Don't you dare talk over Hulk Hogan, right?
[6715.42s -> 6719.58s]  Like, he's like, don't you dare.
[6719.58s -> 6723.50s]  Okay. Well, this is one of the most popular grills on the market.
[6723.50s -> 6726.78s]  It cooks on a slant, and it may drain all the grease.
[6726.78s -> 6728.54s]  But what are some of the other problems it may have?
[6728.54s -> 6730.22s]  This grease is horrible here on the tray.
[6730.22s -> 6731.26s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[6731.26s -> 6733.02s]  Because this has no temperature control.
[6734.14s -> 6735.58s]  Wait, they're making it look like shit.
[6735.58s -> 6739.42s]  The hamburgers are well done at the back while they're still rare in the front.
[6739.42s -> 6741.26s]  And it's a real problem to clean up.
[6742.06s -> 6742.86s]  Now, watch this.
[6743.66s -> 6745.58s]  Oh, that's supposed to be the George Mormon.
[6745.58s -> 6747.58s]  But we're going to put six burgers on there.
[6747.58s -> 6748.86s]  Hey, guys, notice this.
[6748.86s -> 6750.38s]  These aren't ordinary burgers.
[6750.38s -> 6752.22s]  These are Hulk-sized burgers.
[6752.22s -> 6757.50s]  And we are going to show you how we get them to cook evenly from the front all the way to the back.
[6757.50s -> 6759.18s]  Here's where the difference is.
[6759.18s -> 6764.22s]  On the back of this, we have it raised up so that the hinge will automatically pop up.
[6764.22s -> 6767.02s]  And then on the front, we push down and we...
[6767.02s -> 6768.78s]  You know why I don't like these grills?
[6769.66s -> 6770.70s]  Because I can't see it.
[6772.30s -> 6773.82s]  I can't see what the food...
[6774.86s -> 6776.14s]  I need to kind of look at it, right?
[6779.02s -> 6780.06s]  I feel like I want to see it.
[6786.14s -> 6787.02s]  Oh, there's nothing on it.
[6787.98s -> 6788.48s]  Oh!
[6791.02s -> 6792.78s]  It's just meat and bun.
[6792.78s -> 6794.06s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[6794.06s -> 6795.82s]  Look at how small that looks in his hands.
[6799.66s -> 6800.78s]  This is tiny.
[6800.78s -> 6801.66s]  This looks like a toy.
[6810.56s -> 6813.12s]  Like, he actually has to, like, lean down and go, like...
[6813.12s -> 6814.48s]  This is very small.
[6815.68s -> 6819.48s]  I wouldn't consider this to be Hulk-sized.
[6819.56s -> 6821.48s]  No, he just took out a third of the burger in one bite.
[6822.12s -> 6823.24s]  That's not Hulk-sized at all.
[6824.04s -> 6826.70s]  Grill.
[6826.70s -> 6827.50s]  Or ultimate grill.
[6827.50s -> 6829.34s]  The horse can't live on burgers alone, brother.
[6829.34s -> 6832.06s]  What about this panini sandwich maker?
[6832.06s -> 6834.70s]  This is a professional panini maker we went out and bought.
[6834.70s -> 6836.86s]  Costs $430.
[6836.86s -> 6837.42s]  What?
[6837.42s -> 6838.46s]  And it does a great job.
[6838.46s -> 6839.18s]  And what we figured out...
[6839.18s -> 6839.66s]  What?
[6839.66s -> 6840.22s]  That's...
[6840.22s -> 6840.70s]  Seriously.
[6840.70s -> 6841.66s]  ...does a good job is...
[6841.66s -> 6844.14s]  I think that was a genuine reaction because that's horse shit.
[6844.14s -> 6848.06s]  ...and the weight to actually cook the sandwich from top to bottom.
[6848.06s -> 6848.78s]  You said weight.
[6848.78s -> 6850.30s]  This thing looks like it weighs up.
[6851.66s -> 6852.62s]  A ton.
[6852.62s -> 6853.34s]  Yeah, well, that's a lot.
[6853.34s -> 6854.54s]  Okay, who's gonna hold this thing around?
[6854.54s -> 6857.26s]  If even Hulk Hogan's having trouble with this, you know it must be very heavy.
[6857.26s -> 6858.78s]  Well, that's the only thing you really use that for.
[6860.48s -> 6863.52s]  Take a look at those paninis.
[6863.52s -> 6864.32s]  Those are huge.
[6864.32s -> 6866.08s]  Now, do you see how that indent line is there?
[6866.08s -> 6871.44s]  That's the mechanical pressure and weight that we're able to put on with ultimate grill.
[6871.44s -> 6872.72s]  I want one of these shirts.
[6872.72s -> 6873.20s]  Those look great.
[6873.20s -> 6875.52s]  I think those look better than those beautiful burgers.
[6875.52s -> 6877.44s]  I want one of these shirts so bad.
[6877.44s -> 6878.16s]  Look at that cheese.
[6878.16s -> 6878.56s]  You know what I mean?
[6878.56s -> 6879.52s]  Look at how beautifully that smells.
[6879.60s -> 6881.68s]  Like the Hulk Hogan ultimate grill.
[6881.68s -> 6884.40s]  I feel like we'd be glad we got them inside.
[6884.40s -> 6885.20s]  I want one of those.
[6886.88s -> 6888.24s]  Now, get rid of that.
[6888.24s -> 6889.36s]  Pizza is my favorite.
[6889.36s -> 6889.84s]  Really?
[6889.84s -> 6891.92s]  Well, what we did is we went out and bought this pizza maker.
[6892.72s -> 6893.84s]  It takes about 30 minutes.
[6893.84s -> 6896.16s]  It's a little bit faster than heating up your whole oven,
[6896.16s -> 6899.12s]  but it takes 30 minutes to make a pizza.
[6899.12s -> 6899.76s]  Take a look.
[6899.76s -> 6902.48s]  And we got this pizza maker from some shitty infomercial.
[6902.48s -> 6904.48s]  So take a look at our infomercial.
[6904.48s -> 6905.04s]  Ours is better.
[6905.04s -> 6908.40s]  I'm gonna slide this off and I'm gonna cut a piece because I want you to see.
[6908.40s -> 6909.20s]  That one's hot.
[6909.20s -> 6909.92s]  It is hot.
[6909.92s -> 6911.60s]  Believe me, it is very hot.
[6911.60s -> 6912.16s]  Hold on.
[6912.16s -> 6912.72s]  Wait, wait.
[6912.72s -> 6914.16s]  I feel like I missed something here.
[6914.16s -> 6916.56s]  It takes 30 minutes to make a pizza.
[6916.56s -> 6918.88s]  Take a look at that.
[6918.88s -> 6920.32s]  Is that a pizza?
[6920.32s -> 6920.56s]  What?
[6920.56s -> 6921.84s]  That is a pizza.
[6921.84s -> 6925.76s]  Now, I'm gonna slide this off and I'm gonna cut a piece because I want you to see.
[6925.76s -> 6926.72s]  That one's hot.
[6926.72s -> 6927.36s]  It is hot.
[6927.36s -> 6930.32s]  Believe me, it is very, very hot.
[6932.16s -> 6934.00s]  Dude, what's with the pizza cutting?
[6934.00s -> 6935.36s]  Holy shit, bro.
[6935.36s -> 6936.32s]  I cannot believe how good this is.
[6936.32s -> 6936.80s]  Come on.
[6936.80s -> 6937.68s]  I did a smell.
[6937.68s -> 6938.08s]  What was that?
[6938.08s -> 6938.80s]  Oh, that was.
[6939.68s -> 6940.54s]  Isn't that great?
[6940.54s -> 6941.34s]  Now, let me show you the bottom.
[6941.34s -> 6942.22s]  God, it looks good.
[6942.22s -> 6942.70s]  Look at this.
[6943.58s -> 6944.94s]  Oh, it's grilled perfectly.
[6944.94s -> 6945.50s]  What is he?
[6945.50s -> 6946.86s]  Isn't it?
[6946.86s -> 6947.98s]  He's like scratching it.
[6948.86s -> 6949.74s]  He didn't even bite it.
[6949.74s -> 6950.94s]  Very, very hot.
[6950.94s -> 6951.90s]  He didn't even bite it.
[6952.94s -> 6955.18s]  Now, this is probably gonna be too hot to eat, Hulk.
[6955.18s -> 6956.14s]  This grill's amazing.
[6956.14s -> 6958.30s]  I cannot believe how good this pizza looks.
[6958.30s -> 6959.98s]  Just to get a smell and a feel of that.
[6959.98s -> 6960.62s]  A smell?
[6960.62s -> 6961.26s]  It's pizza.
[6961.26s -> 6961.58s]  Isn't that great?
[6961.58s -> 6962.38s]  Now, let me show you the bottom.
[6962.38s -> 6963.26s]  God, it looks good.
[6963.26s -> 6963.74s]  Look at this.
[6964.62s -> 6966.06s]  Oh, it's grilled perfectly.
[6966.06s -> 6966.94s]  It's perfect, isn't it?
[6969.79s -> 6971.87s]  I actually think the one on the pizza maker looks a little better.
[6971.87s -> 6973.31s]  In the morning breakfast, without a doubt,
[6973.31s -> 6975.39s]  this is the most important meal in my family.
[6975.39s -> 6976.67s]  I do the cooking in the morning.
[6977.23s -> 6979.87s]  So one of the problems I have is sometimes the eggs
[6979.87s -> 6982.67s]  aren't ready when the sausage is ready, the pancakes aren't done.
[6982.67s -> 6983.07s]  All right, yeah.
[6983.07s -> 6983.79s]  It's a real pain for me.
[6983.79s -> 6985.47s]  I have to figure out a way to make it all work at once.
[6985.47s -> 6988.75s]  OK, well, that's because even though this griddle costs over $100,
[6988.75s -> 6989.23s]  you really can't get every piece.
[6989.23s -> 6990.75s]  I mean, the problem is you didn't get Kathy Mitchell.
[6990.75s -> 6991.87s]  Look at all the grease.
[6991.87s -> 6992.35s]  The grease is in the pancakes.
[6992.35s -> 6993.39s]  Wait, did you just tell him to shut up?
[6993.39s -> 6994.03s]  That is ridiculous.
[6994.03s -> 6998.27s]  So if we could, well, that's because even though this griddle costs over $100,
[6998.27s -> 7000.11s]  you really can't cook everything at the same time.
[7000.11s -> 7000.51s]  Wait a minute, stop.
[7000.51s -> 7001.39s]  Look at all the grease.
[7001.39s -> 7003.07s]  The grease is in the pancakes.
[7004.03s -> 7005.23s]  That was an annoyed stop.
[7005.23s -> 7007.55s]  If we could separate the eggs in the pancakes from the bacon and sausage,
[7007.55s -> 7008.75s]  we'd have the solution, right?
[7008.75s -> 7009.25s]  You got it.
[7010.19s -> 7013.39s]  I put a griddle plate in here and a grill plate here.
[7013.39s -> 7016.43s]  I've already grilled the sausage at about 350 degrees.
[7016.43s -> 7020.91s]  I turned it down because I have the control to just warm about 200 degrees.
[7020.91s -> 7021.47s]  It's not following.
[7021.47s -> 7025.47s]  I cranked this up to 375 because now I'm ready to make pancakes
[7025.47s -> 7027.55s]  and now you can make your eggs to order.
[7027.63s -> 7029.07s]  Let's throw some eggs on there, buddy.
[7029.07s -> 7033.07s]  We can actually do a dozen eggs on here at a time if we want or about eight pancakes.
[7033.71s -> 7035.07s]  How about that for breakfast?
[7035.07s -> 7035.63s]  That's great.
[7035.63s -> 7036.43s]  That's unbelievable.
[7038.36s -> 7042.12s]  But okay, what's but a skill with this is it's good.
[7042.12s -> 7042.60s]  It's fine.
[7043.48s -> 7045.76s]  I think it's very interesting.
[7045.76s -> 7046.40s]  God damn it.
[7046.40s -> 7048.88s]  You know, one thing that I wish whatever ever happened to me in my life,
[7050.80s -> 7052.32s]  they used to do an infomercial of these.
[7052.32s -> 7053.52s]  Look at we're in a mall.
[7054.24s -> 7059.47s]  Come try it and come check it out and be on TV.
[7059.47s -> 7060.27s]  God damn it, man.
[7060.27s -> 7064.27s]  I wish I wish I if I if I ever see this ever,
[7064.83s -> 7067.39s]  I am running up to that fucking thing and being first in line.
[7068.11s -> 7069.15s]  I want to be that.
[7069.15s -> 7072.83s]  I want to be the weird guy that's just like it's so fresh.
[7072.83s -> 7074.27s]  It's delicious.
[7074.27s -> 7076.11s]  Better than better than grandma makes.
[7076.11s -> 7078.70s]  I want to do that so bad, even if it sucks.
[7080.40s -> 7082.96s]  I wish I could show you an infomercial where I was one of these people.
[7085.68s -> 7089.44s]  You can do all this with the one one system because we have a waffle iron.
[7089.44s -> 7092.72s]  We have a little sandwich maker and then we make our pizzas in the regular oven.
[7092.72s -> 7093.76s]  So this is very good.
[7093.76s -> 7095.92s]  I like the idea of this compared to other girls.
[7095.92s -> 7098.16s]  It's a lot different variety of foods that you can cook,
[7098.16s -> 7100.64s]  whereas the others just sort of limited to certain things.
[7100.64s -> 7106.88s]  I'm a vegetarian and so it would be really easy for us to make it just like his neck muscles up.
[7106.88s -> 7109.12s]  It's just nice to be able to get something done for the whole family
[7109.12s -> 7111.36s]  all at once instead of having to break it down into little pieces.
[7111.36s -> 7113.52s]  So everybody can sit down and eat at the same time.
[7113.52s -> 7114.64s]  I'm too busy to talk.
[7114.64s -> 7115.92s]  I'm eating the delicious food.
[7117.68s -> 7118.40s]  Oh, that was a bump.
[7118.40s -> 7120.08s]  I can't wait to get this for my dorm room.
[7120.08s -> 7122.32s]  I can make like waffles in the morning and eggs.
[7122.40s -> 7123.20s]  I envy this.
[7123.20s -> 7124.56s]  Watch, make some pizza.
[7124.56s -> 7125.76s]  Don't get some hot dogs.
[7125.76s -> 7128.16s]  My room is going to be the life of every party.
[7128.16s -> 7131.36s]  I'm a tall big guy and I definitely like eating burgers.
[7131.36s -> 7132.72s]  Nice large burgers.
[7132.72s -> 7135.12s]  The executive is so perfect for that.
[7135.12s -> 7136.16s]  Cookies, pizza.
[7136.16s -> 7137.12s]  Perfect for the executive.
[7137.12s -> 7138.72s]  Burgers, waffles.
[7138.72s -> 7140.00s]  The best thing in the world.
[7140.00s -> 7145.28s]  See, as far as I know that I wish nothing on the market that cooks frozen steaks.
[7145.28s -> 7146.80s]  Are those frozen, buddy?
[7146.80s -> 7147.44s]  Get out of there.
[7147.44s -> 7148.24s]  Yeah, those are frozen.
[7148.24s -> 7149.60s]  Okay, get them out there.
[7149.60s -> 7150.80s]  What's going on with the music here?
[7150.96s -> 7154.40s]  I could finally hear them talking to each other.
[7155.04s -> 7158.40s]  I was like, oh, this is like better somehow, right?
[7158.40s -> 7160.56s]  When this came back, wasn't it like, oh, cool, nice.
[7160.56s -> 7161.84s]  They're talking to each other.
[7161.84s -> 7166.44s]  As far as I know, there is nothing on the market that cooks frozen steaks.
[7166.44s -> 7167.48s]  Are those frozen, buddy?
[7168.52s -> 7169.40s]  Yeah, those are frozen.
[7169.40s -> 7170.92s]  Okay, get them out there.
[7170.92s -> 7171.40s]  Geez.
[7171.40s -> 7173.80s]  Now, what we're going to do is we're going to unlock the back.
[7173.80s -> 7174.44s]  These are frozen.
[7175.32s -> 7177.32s]  We're going to unlock the back of the grill.
[7177.32s -> 7179.24s]  Two inch frozen steaks.
[7179.24s -> 7181.16s]  They certainly are and we're going to put them on here.
[7182.68s -> 7183.64s]  Those are frozen.
[7183.64s -> 7184.76s]  Now, I know you like them.
[7184.76s -> 7186.44s]  Yeah, they are very frozen.
[7186.44s -> 7188.12s]  I'm going to take a couple of potatoes.
[7188.12s -> 7190.44s]  I'm going to put them on here with it because they're frozen.
[7190.44s -> 7191.96s]  They're going to get up at the same time.
[7191.96s -> 7192.92s]  They're going to cook perfectly.
[7192.92s -> 7196.84s]  In about 20 minutes, you're going to have perfectly cooked steaks.
[7196.84s -> 7198.36s]  Those aren't even the same shape.
[7198.36s -> 7202.68s]  Here's how we turned the ultimate grill into the ultimate party buffet warmer.
[7202.68s -> 7203.16s]  Party buffet.
[7203.16s -> 7204.60s]  Again, we opened it double.
[7204.60s -> 7206.52s]  In this case, I used two griddle plates.
[7206.52s -> 7207.88s]  You can use a griddle and a grill.
[7208.44s -> 7210.76s]  I turned the dual heat settings down to warm.
[7210.76s -> 7213.56s]  Now, we have 10 of your favorite orders.
[7213.56s -> 7214.68s]  No, I don't say that.
[7214.68s -> 7215.08s]  I don't know.
[7215.08s -> 7215.96s]  All you have to do is come in and enjoy.
[7215.96s -> 7216.52s]  It's going to keep it warm.
[7216.52s -> 7217.00s]  I don't know.
[7217.48s -> 7218.12s]  I don't know.
[7218.12s -> 7218.68s]  Okay.
[7218.68s -> 7226.28s]  Open or closed, big or small, fresh or frozen, Paul Hogan's ultimate grill truly does it all, brother.
[7226.28s -> 7227.56s]  I can't wait to see this.
[7227.56s -> 7228.20s]  But wait a minute.
[7228.20s -> 7232.28s]  It hasn't done its all yet because I haven't even showed you your favorite thing, waffles.
[7232.28s -> 7233.96s]  And I know you like Mexican food.
[7233.96s -> 7235.24s]  How about quesadillas?
[7235.24s -> 7235.48s]  What?
[7235.48s -> 7236.36s]  Let me come back.
[7236.36s -> 7238.20s]  Oh, I'm on the edge of my seat right now.
[7238.20s -> 7238.84s]  On the market.
[7238.84s -> 7241.88s]  Some of them may drain the grease, but don't cook the meat evenly.
[7241.88s -> 7245.16s]  And the cleanup is a mess introducing Paul Hogan.
[7245.16s -> 7249.00s]  Thank God there's something to finally call to it because it's extra large interchangeable
[7249.00s -> 7252.92s]  plates easily transforms your Hulk Hogan grill into a skillet waffle.
[7252.92s -> 7253.64s]  All right, we get it.
[7253.64s -> 7254.12s]  We get it.
[7254.12s -> 7254.84s]  We know we get it.
[7255.56s -> 7257.08s]  Show me the show me the duo again, please.
[7258.68s -> 7265.48s]  Hi, guys.
[7265.48s -> 7266.60s]  Welcome back.
[7266.60s -> 7272.60s]  Bob and I just showed you how my ultimate grill replaced over $1,200 with a professional kitchen
[7272.60s -> 7273.32s]  appliances.
[7273.32s -> 7274.44s]  All right, we're not done yet.
[7274.44s -> 7275.96s]  We can't do quesadillas.
[7275.96s -> 7281.80s]  Well, remember just before we left, we put two two and a half inch frozen steaks in here
[7281.80s -> 7283.08s]  along with a couple of potatoes.
[7283.08s -> 7284.12s]  Let's see how they came out.
[7284.12s -> 7284.92s]  Are you ready?
[7284.92s -> 7286.52s]  Boomer century video.
[7286.52s -> 7288.20s]  Take a look at that.
[7288.20s -> 7290.36s]  Well, here's the deal with the frozen steaks.
[7290.36s -> 7295.24s]  Yeah, I've never seen or heard of anybody cooking frozen steaks and getting them totally
[7295.24s -> 7295.96s]  perfect.
[7295.96s -> 7297.64s]  Even cook perfectly on the inside.
[7297.64s -> 7298.68s]  Well, let's just see.
[7298.68s -> 7303.24s]  This is just the way you would just thought that juice
[7303.48s -> 7303.88s]  look at that.
[7303.88s -> 7304.52s]  Now, that's what I call it.
[7304.52s -> 7306.76s]  It's always about the juiciness of the steak, right?
[7306.76s -> 7309.56s]  It's always like, look, I'm going to press and it's because we have juice is going to
[7309.56s -> 7311.56s]  come up at the same time.
[7314.24s -> 7317.52s]  They care more about how much water is coming out of cheese sandwiches.
[7317.52s -> 7319.76s]  I love grilled cheese, but you told me you had a problem with it.
[7319.76s -> 7323.92s]  It's never get the center finished the same time the outer edges do.
[7323.92s -> 7326.40s]  And I always make a mess and I always burn them.
[7326.40s -> 7329.52s]  Well, how about if I told you we're going to make these grilled cheese sandwiches, four
[7329.52s -> 7333.04s]  of them oversized, by the way, as you can see, in about 30 seconds.
[7333.04s -> 7334.16s]  All right, 30 seconds.
[7334.24s -> 7336.32s]  Now, the way we're going to do that is we're going to use pressure.
[7337.36s -> 7338.24s]  Give it a press.
[7338.24s -> 7339.36s]  It locks in place.
[7339.36s -> 7340.16s]  30 seconds.
[7340.16s -> 7341.28s]  Are you counting?
[7341.28s -> 7341.52s]  All right.
[7342.88s -> 7348.52s]  But a grilled cheese is like a grilled cheese is very easy to make.
[7348.52s -> 7349.72s]  It's very easy.
[7352.06s -> 7352.94s]  What is he saying here?
[7352.94s -> 7357.90s]  Problem with it can never get the center finished the same time the outer edges do.
[7357.90s -> 7360.30s]  And I always make a mess and I always burn them.
[7361.02s -> 7364.75s]  But I fucking love Paul Cogan.
[7364.83s -> 7368.11s]  How about if I told you we're going to make these grilled cheese sandwiches, four of them
[7368.11s -> 7371.23s]  oversized, by the way, as you can see, in about 30 seconds.
[7371.23s -> 7372.51s]  Always, man.
[7372.51s -> 7372.99s]  Always.
[7374.03s -> 7375.71s]  You burn it every time.
[7376.35s -> 7379.15s]  I'm imagining this is like, oh, well, I want to make grilled cheese sandwich.
[7379.15s -> 7380.03s]  I burnt it again.
[7380.67s -> 7382.03s]  I burn it every time.
[7382.99s -> 7383.71s]  Turn the heat down.
[7385.44s -> 7386.32s]  Give it a press.
[7386.32s -> 7387.44s]  It locks in place.
[7387.44s -> 7388.16s]  30 seconds.
[7388.16s -> 7388.64s]  Are you counting?
[7388.64s -> 7389.44s]  30 seconds.
[7389.44s -> 7391.20s]  I'm getting ready to call you out on this one.
[7392.16s -> 7393.20s]  Here we go.
[7393.20s -> 7394.08s]  But we don't know how much.
[7394.08s -> 7394.56s]  Wow.
[7394.56s -> 7395.36s]  How about that?
[7396.56s -> 7398.16s]  Now, that was 30 seconds.
[7398.16s -> 7401.36s]  We've got molten cheese sandwiches inside.
[7401.36s -> 7401.92s]  Molten.
[7401.92s -> 7405.04s]  Now, the true test is if they're the same all the way through.
[7406.16s -> 7407.28s]  I get his point, though.
[7409.44s -> 7411.28s]  They're too hot for me to handle.
[7411.28s -> 7413.76s]  And just take a look at that.
[7413.76s -> 7414.64s]  How about that?
[7414.64s -> 7415.28s]  Let me see that.
[7415.28s -> 7416.24s]  Okay, grab a bite.
[7416.24s -> 7416.64s]  Now, careful.
[7416.64s -> 7420.96s]  Don't burn yourself because they are hot, hot, hot, hot sandwiches right now.
[7420.96s -> 7422.08s]  Instant replay.
[7422.08s -> 7424.64s]  Just in case you want to see those grill marks.
[7424.64s -> 7428.64s]  I wanted someone to explain to me here.
[7428.64s -> 7432.68s]  What is the obsession with the grill marks?
[7432.68s -> 7435.44s]  Oh, but look, it's got grill marks on it now.
[7435.44s -> 7438.57s]  Who fucking cares?
[7438.57s -> 7439.61s]  Who cares?
[7439.61s -> 7445.55s]  Dude, it's a hot dog and it tastes exactly the same, but this time it's got grill marks on it.
[7445.55s -> 7447.95s]  Okay, who cares?
[7447.95s -> 7454.60s]  Why is that such a huge, huge selling point?
[7454.60s -> 7456.92s]  Yeah, it's somebody just said it's just a racing stripe.
[7457.08s -> 7465.26s]  The grill marks on a real grill, it's like, okay, you're cooking on a fire or with propane or
[7466.30s -> 7466.78s]  charcoal.
[7466.78s -> 7471.79s]  Is it having just like a grate that makes marks on your food doesn't make it cooked on a grill,
[7471.79s -> 7474.03s]  like doesn't make it cooked on like a charcoal grill.
[7474.03s -> 7476.67s]  It's like pretending it adds texture.
[7476.67s -> 7477.23s]  Not really, though.
[7477.23s -> 7479.92s]  A hot dog.
[7479.92s -> 7485.74s]  This is a great time for a party that if you're going that way, all right, give it a press.
[7485.74s -> 7489.90s]  It'll snap into place and those hot dogs are going to be like, oh, they're going to be like,
[7489.90s -> 7493.10s]  snap into place and those hot dogs are going to be done in about two minutes.
[7493.10s -> 7494.22s]  It adds swag.
[7494.94s -> 7496.70s]  Hey, look at that.
[7496.70s -> 7497.50s]  It's party time.
[7497.50s -> 7498.78s]  It's party time.
[7498.78s -> 7500.30s]  Just roll it right out.
[7500.94s -> 7503.50s]  Oh, if only you had that canvas scooper.
[7503.50s -> 7505.58s]  If only you had the canvas scooper, you'd be just fine.
[7505.58s -> 7506.38s]  What was it called again?
[7507.90s -> 7509.04s]  The hammock grabber.
[7509.76s -> 7515.13s]  I love the instant replay.
[7520.62s -> 7523.66s]  I cook shrimp and steak and it's done quickly.
[7523.66s -> 7525.02s]  There's enough for everybody.
[7525.02s -> 7525.98s]  We take it to the beach.
[7525.98s -> 7527.10s]  We take it to a cabin.
[7527.74s -> 7530.06s]  And it's done and steak and it's done.
[7530.78s -> 7532.06s]  He's not sure about this.
[7532.06s -> 7532.62s]  Quickly.
[7532.62s -> 7533.50s]  There's enough for everybody.
[7537.58s -> 7538.94s]  We take it to the beach.
[7538.94s -> 7539.98s]  We take it to a cabin.
[7539.98s -> 7542.06s]  And the cleanup is so simple and easy.
[7542.06s -> 7543.34s]  It's the ultimate grill.
[7543.34s -> 7545.66s]  We love to have our friends over and to entertain.
[7545.66s -> 7548.70s]  And in the past, it was bringing out the hors d'oeuvres from the oven,
[7548.70s -> 7549.82s]  putting them on the tray.
[7549.82s -> 7550.86s]  They would get cold.
[7550.86s -> 7553.42s]  He's like, now with the whole cold and ultimate grill,
[7553.42s -> 7555.26s]  we put all the hors d'oeuvres in one place.
[7555.26s -> 7556.46s]  They stay warm.
[7556.46s -> 7559.10s]  And we have enough time to spend with our friends.
[7559.10s -> 7560.70s]  That's an application for this.
[7562.09s -> 7564.25s]  Having like it's served but on low heat.
[7564.25s -> 7566.96s]  I could see that as kind of like a party tray sister
[7566.96s -> 7568.96s]  because shit does get cold.
[7568.96s -> 7570.08s]  I could see that.
[7573.50s -> 7574.70s]  This is an application for this.
[7577.34s -> 7581.24s]  What kind of waffles do you like?
[7581.24s -> 7583.00s]  Well, not this kind.
[7583.00s -> 7584.28s]  It's too small.
[7584.84s -> 7586.44s]  I like big golden brown.
[7586.44s -> 7587.24s]  Perfect waffles.
[7587.24s -> 7587.96s]  Fluffy and big.
[7587.96s -> 7589.48s]  Well, this is a professional waffle maker.
[7589.48s -> 7590.20s]  It costs $90.
[7590.20s -> 7590.92s]  What's wrong with that?
[7590.92s -> 7594.04s]  Job of making waffles, but this is how much waffles it makes.
[7594.04s -> 7595.72s]  So what we did with the ultimate grill,
[7595.72s -> 7597.64s]  remember, we give you interchangeable plates.
[7597.64s -> 7601.88s]  These are optional to your Hulk Hogan grill.
[7601.88s -> 7605.08s]  So all we do now is we swap out by pushing the button here
[7605.08s -> 7605.56s]  and here.
[7605.56s -> 7607.16s]  I love Hulk Hogan.
[7607.16s -> 7608.60s]  Your waffle plates.
[7608.60s -> 7611.72s]  Now Hulk Hogan is like a real Superman.
[7611.72s -> 7615.08s]  This is the same amount exactly of batter as that reason.
[7615.08s -> 7615.40s]  Hold on.
[7615.40s -> 7615.96s]  Pause, Andy.
[7615.96s -> 7617.96s]  I know the reason why I used to love wrestling
[7617.96s -> 7620.52s]  is because Hulk Hogan was a real superhero.
[7620.52s -> 7625.84s]  He was in real life, like the ultimate warrior macho man.
[7625.84s -> 7628.41s]  These guys were superheroes.
[7628.41s -> 7630.41s]  I saw Hulk Hogan not as a wrestler,
[7630.41s -> 7632.57s]  but as like Captain America, essentially.
[7634.99s -> 7635.71s]  I loved it.
[7635.71s -> 7638.03s]  It was just like, wow, there he is, like a superhero.
[7638.83s -> 7640.91s]  He like fights for good.
[7640.91s -> 7641.87s]  He was like Captain America.
[7641.87s -> 7643.79s]  So that's one professional machine's worth,
[7643.79s -> 7645.79s]  two professional machines worth, three professional machines worth.
[7645.79s -> 7647.79s]  This grill got recalled.
[7647.79s -> 7648.19s]  Wait a minute.
[7648.19s -> 7649.71s]  You said that was a $90 machine?
[7649.71s -> 7650.67s]  That was a $90 machine.
[7650.67s -> 7651.31s]  We're going to do four.
[7651.31s -> 7652.75s]  So we're making four waffles at the same time.
[7652.75s -> 7655.63s]  So that's like having a $360 machine right here.
[7655.63s -> 7656.83s]  Well, we're going to see how they come out,
[7656.83s -> 7658.19s]  but they're going to be absolutely perfect.
[7658.19s -> 7659.63s]  Give your machine a little love.
[7659.63s -> 7660.11s]  Press it.
[7660.11s -> 7661.39s]  Now we've got the pressure in there.
[7661.39s -> 7663.31s]  We know that we're set at 375.
[7663.31s -> 7664.35s]  Top and bottom.
[7664.35s -> 7665.07s]  They're going to come out good.
[7665.07s -> 7665.87s]  We finally read it.
[7667.07s -> 7668.83s]  Let's see how are we done with our waffle.
[7668.83s -> 7669.63s]  Really?
[7669.63s -> 7669.95s]  Beautiful.
[7669.95s -> 7671.39s]  How about that?
[7671.39s -> 7673.15s]  Now, is that an ordinary waffle?
[7676.99s -> 7678.75s]  What's going on?
[7678.75s -> 7679.63s]  I just bought a piece of the pizza.
[7679.63s -> 7680.35s]  It was really good.
[7680.35s -> 7683.55s]  I can't believe how crispy the pizza was on the bottom.
[7683.55s -> 7684.11s]  Does it not?
[7684.11s -> 7685.31s]  Yeah, remember the crispy pizza?
[7685.31s -> 7687.71s]  The secret is the ultimate grill cooks with mechanical pressure.
[7687.79s -> 7690.59s]  Just lock the lid, instantly searing it off it.
[7690.59s -> 7692.83s]  You'll love your Hulk Hogan ultimate grill.
[7692.83s -> 7695.39s]  I'm not going to give you a 30-day money back guarantee.
[7695.39s -> 7697.87s]  I'm going to give you a 60-day money back guarantee.
[7697.87s -> 7698.43s]  I love that.
[7698.43s -> 7700.75s]  Because I'm putting my name on it.
[7700.75s -> 7703.39s]  When you call, ask your operators how you can get the waffle.
[7704.75s -> 7705.31s]  Oh, cookies.
[7705.31s -> 7706.35s]  We're going to say this.
[7706.35s -> 7707.71s]  Cookie baking machine.
[7707.71s -> 7709.39s]  Now we can do little cookies.
[7709.39s -> 7710.43s]  Those are huge cookies.
[7710.43s -> 7711.63s]  Now that's a little cookie.
[7711.63s -> 7714.27s]  In here, we got a Hawks.
[7714.27s -> 7714.77s]  Whoa.
[7715.73s -> 7717.89s]  Now, want to decorate that?
[7717.89s -> 7718.77s]  Nobody's going to.
[7718.77s -> 7719.49s]  That's too big.
[7719.49s -> 7720.69s]  I put my smile and face on the whole thing.
[7720.69s -> 7722.05s]  That's just a pancake.
[7722.05s -> 7724.21s]  I've bought cookies the size of the grocery store.
[7724.21s -> 7725.49s]  And they're like $40.
[7725.49s -> 7727.17s]  If I bought three or four or five cookies.
[7727.17s -> 7728.13s]  That's a pancake.
[7728.13s -> 7729.41s]  That would pay for my whole machine.
[7729.41s -> 7729.89s]  That's crazy.
[7729.89s -> 7732.51s]  There you go.
[7732.51s -> 7735.39s]  Wait, did you say that buying three cookies at the grocery store?
[7735.39s -> 7738.35s]  Because not only does it make a ton of delicious meals,
[7738.35s -> 7742.27s]  I can also make a giant cookie and surprise my kids and my whole family.
[7742.27s -> 7744.11s]  Now everyone wants a cookie.
[7744.19s -> 7746.99s]  Our family absolutely loves quesadillas.
[7746.99s -> 7748.11s]  What's with the cookie thing?
[7748.11s -> 7748.99s]  It's fast.
[7748.99s -> 7749.87s]  It's fun.
[7749.87s -> 7751.47s]  The kids have a bowl making it.
[7751.47s -> 7754.51s]  And we know we're getting something good when we're eating at home.
[7754.51s -> 7755.23s]  That looks pretty good.
[7755.23s -> 7756.03s]  We love pizza.
[7756.03s -> 7759.71s]  And as a family of five, the whole family can make pizza together.
[7759.71s -> 7761.39s]  And we can have dinner on the table.
[7761.39s -> 7764.59s]  And I've bought a ton of quesadillas.
[7764.59s -> 7765.87s]  Everybody participates.
[7765.87s -> 7767.31s]  Everyone wants a cookie.
[7767.31s -> 7771.17s]  Our family absolutely loves quesadillas.
[7771.73s -> 7777.57s]  And we know we're getting something good when we're eating at home.
[7777.57s -> 7779.09s]  We love pizza.
[7779.09s -> 7784.85s]  And as a family of five, the whole family can make pizza together.
[7784.85s -> 7787.89s]  And we can have dinner on the table in 15 minutes.
[7787.89s -> 7791.65s]  With fresh ingredients that I bought for a third of the price of pizza,
[7791.65s -> 7792.85s]  Paula pizza.
[7792.85s -> 7797.57s]  Well, I love to make it's big enough.
[7797.57s -> 7798.69s]  It's got a wide surface.
[7798.69s -> 7800.85s]  I could put two large paninis on there.
[7800.85s -> 7802.29s]  And it's done in like three minutes.
[7804.05s -> 7806.05s]  Everybody lives in the same house.
[7806.05s -> 7807.41s]  How big is this house?
[7807.41s -> 7808.21s]  Sausage on there.
[7808.21s -> 7810.45s]  We can make waffles, pancakes.
[7810.45s -> 7811.17s]  Dude, I'm sorry.
[7811.17s -> 7814.29s]  Only so many people can use the Hulk Hogan grill at 8 o'clock in the morning.
[7816.18s -> 7820.18s]  I promise you guys, you're going to be so happy with Hulk Hogan's ultimate grill.
[7820.18s -> 7822.10s]  You're going to use it each and every day.
[7822.10s -> 7825.30s]  It's the ultimate cookie maker, the ultimate panini sandwich press,
[7825.30s -> 7827.46s]  the ultimate pizza oven, the ultimate grill.
[7827.46s -> 7828.90s]  The ultimate cookie maker.
[7829.38s -> 7831.22s]  The ultimate quesadilla maker.
[7831.22s -> 7832.50s]  The ultimate waffle maker.
[7832.50s -> 7837.14s]  And it's the ultimate grill, which truly makes it the ultimate kitchen appliance.
[7837.14s -> 7841.70s]  So big or small, open or closed, fresh or frozen,
[7841.70s -> 7844.74s]  Hulk Hogan's ultimate grill does it all, brother.
[7845.54s -> 7846.82s]  Thank you so much.
[7846.82s -> 7847.70s]  We're a champ.
[7847.70s -> 7849.06s]  Let's go practice our wrestling now.
[7849.06s -> 7850.02s]  Come on, I need some help.
[7850.98s -> 7855.18s]  Hulk is going to go wrestle this guy?
[7855.18s -> 7857.60s]  He's going to go kick the shit out of this guy.
[7857.60s -> 7860.64s]  Hulk Hogan's ultimate grill does it all, brother.
[7861.36s -> 7862.72s]  Yeah, like, is he saying that?
[7862.72s -> 7863.60s]  We're a champ.
[7863.60s -> 7864.96s]  Let's go practice our wrestling now.
[7864.96s -> 7865.92s]  Come on, I need some help.
[7866.72s -> 7868.48s]  Is he saying that to production?
[7868.48s -> 7871.44s]  Like, guys, I'm going to need help over here on the right.
[7872.94s -> 7876.42s]  He's talking to production.
[7876.42s -> 7878.18s]  Grill does it all, brother.
[7878.98s -> 7880.26s]  Thank you so much.
[7880.26s -> 7881.14s]  We're a champ.
[7881.14s -> 7882.42s]  Let's go practice our wrestling now.
[7882.42s -> 7883.46s]  Come on, I need some help.
[7888.94s -> 7891.66s]  I don't know, what an enjoyable experience that was.
[7893.49s -> 7894.61s]  The ultimate grill.
[7894.61s -> 7895.81s]  Hulk's ultimate grill.
[7897.31s -> 7898.03s]  All right, what's what I got?
[7899.50s -> 7900.06s]  Oh, there's more.
[7905.31s -> 7908.05s]  We were back here.
[7908.05s -> 7909.49s]  All right, perfect meatloaf.
[7911.10s -> 7913.10s]  By the way, I hope everyone understands.
[7915.81s -> 7917.57s]  I'm doing this more often.
[7917.57s -> 7921.23s]  I'm doing this way more often.
[7923.06s -> 7924.66s]  There's so many things to watch.
[7924.66s -> 7925.86s]  There's so many products to watch.
[7925.86s -> 7929.34s]  I was just testing it today to see if this was fun.
[7929.34s -> 7931.74s]  Absolutely.
[7931.74s -> 7932.46s]  We're doing this again.
[7932.46s -> 7933.74s]  This is, like, amazing.
[7933.74s -> 7934.46s]  This is so much fun.
[7935.34s -> 7936.46s]  I love watching this stuff.
[7936.46s -> 7938.62s]  And I'm so glad that I can share it with you
[7938.62s -> 7942.16s]  because I would lie in bed, put some of these on.
[7942.16s -> 7944.88s]  I haven't seen any of these ones, but, I mean, maybe I have.
[7944.88s -> 7945.84s]  Maybe I haven't.
[7945.84s -> 7948.14s]  But I would just sit there and, like, think these things.
[7949.79s -> 7952.85s]  I want to just talk about it.
[7952.85s -> 7955.71s]  So, yeah, we'll do this again.
[7955.71s -> 7957.79s]  Okay, what about the perfect meatloaf plus?
[7957.79s -> 7959.23s]  We've seen meatloaf before.
[7959.23s -> 7965.58s]  Growing up, my family made the most amazing meatloaf.
[7965.58s -> 7967.18s]  But we had a secret.
[7967.18s -> 7970.14s]  Look, delicious seasoned beef on the outside.
[7970.14s -> 7974.06s]  And, oh, boy, loaded baked potatoes on the inside.
[7974.06s -> 7975.02s]  How they do it?
[7975.02s -> 7977.18s]  It's the perfect meatloaf plus.
[7977.18s -> 7979.74s]  The new non-stick way to bake and serve the perfect meatloaf.
[7979.74s -> 7981.34s]  A baked potato on the inside?
[7981.34s -> 7981.82s]  Watch.
[7981.82s -> 7983.42s]  Add your favorite meat to the pan.
[7983.42s -> 7984.70s]  Press to make an opening.
[7984.70s -> 7985.18s]  Pop in your favorite stuffing.
[7985.18s -> 7986.70s]  And all more of this stuffed shit.
[7986.70s -> 7987.98s]  Now seal and bake.
[7987.98s -> 7989.74s]  You don't need, you don't stuff a meatloaf.
[7989.74s -> 7991.34s]  You just made a yummy cold cut stuffed meatloaf.
[7991.34s -> 7991.84s]  Cool.
[7991.84s -> 7993.18s]  The main choices inside are endless.
[7993.18s -> 7994.06s]  What?
[7994.06s -> 7995.66s]  Like asparagus caught on blue.
[7995.66s -> 7996.22s]  That was real.
[7996.22s -> 7996.70s]  You heard that.
[7996.70s -> 7999.34s]  And then loaded pizza, vegetable medley, even ooey gooey.
[7999.34s -> 8000.46s]  Did you guys hear that?
[8000.46s -> 8001.98s]  Now that's delicioso.
[8001.98s -> 8004.78s]  All made simple with our easy press and sealer.
[8004.86s -> 8007.98s]  Best of all, my old country elevates your meatloaf.
[8007.98s -> 8011.58s]  So all the oils and fats drain away, making it healthier.
[8011.58s -> 8013.74s]  Why make crumbly, boring meatloaf?
[8013.74s -> 8014.78s]  They use that same image.
[8014.78s -> 8016.86s]  Moist, delicious stuffed meatloaf.
[8016.86s -> 8018.78s]  Just like my Aunt Nancy makes.
[8018.78s -> 8020.38s]  Which like my Aunt Nancy makes.
[8020.38s -> 8021.34s]  Moist, delicious.
[8023.74s -> 8036.43s]  Nancy's meatloaf is an egg, spinach, cheese, and like bananas?
[8036.43s -> 8040.48s]  Are these like maintains?
[8042.16s -> 8044.24s]  Stuffed meatloaf, just like my Aunt Nancy makes.
[8044.24s -> 8045.12s]  What's in there?
[8045.12s -> 8047.28s]  With my superior nonstick surface.
[8047.28s -> 8049.20s]  Just lift, slide, and serve.
[8049.20s -> 8050.64s]  No messy cleanups.
[8050.64s -> 8053.92s]  Imagine beef meatloaf with stuffed manicotti.
[8053.92s -> 8056.32s]  Turkey with Thanksgiving Day stuffing.
[8056.32s -> 8057.36s]  Or chicken with portobello mushrooms.
[8057.36s -> 8058.00s]  All right, I'd eat that one.
[8058.00s -> 8058.96s]  I'd eat that one.
[8058.96s -> 8062.16s]  You can also do cornbread, pull apart cinnamon bread,
[8062.16s -> 8063.76s]  even strawberry shortcake.
[8063.76s -> 8064.96s]  I'd eat the turkey one.
[8064.96s -> 8065.92s]  Plus it's all dishwasher safe.
[8065.92s -> 8068.40s]  Other pans sell for up to $40.
[8068.40s -> 8069.60s]  And they don't even have a lifting tray or easy press.
[8069.60s -> 8071.20s]  You should try these and do reviews on them.
[8071.20s -> 8072.24s]  But order right now.
[8072.24s -> 8073.68s]  I can already tell you all the reviews.
[8073.68s -> 8075.44s]  Is only $14.95.
[8075.44s -> 8076.80s]  I can already tell you that each one of these
[8076.80s -> 8077.68s]  is going to be like a mess.
[8077.68s -> 8078.88s]  And I'm just going to be like, I don't like this.
[8079.52s -> 8083.04s]  OK.
[8083.04s -> 8085.28s]  The pasta-fina.
[8085.28s -> 8090.19s]  Pasta-fina.
[8090.19s -> 8093.47s]  To make pasta on the stove, you boil, stir, and toil.
[8093.47s -> 8094.51s]  And watch out.
[8094.51s -> 8095.87s]  It's sure to make a mess.
[8095.87s -> 8096.67s]  Then you strain.
[8098.03s -> 8099.31s]  That first is trashed.
[8099.31s -> 8100.03s]  Pasta is not a choice.
[8100.03s -> 8100.83s]  Then you strain.
[8100.83s -> 8101.63s]  Make a mess.
[8101.63s -> 8102.35s]  Then you strain.
[8102.99s -> 8104.83s]  Why would you dump the whole thing up?
[8104.83s -> 8105.79s]  Make a mess.
[8105.87s -> 8106.91s]  It's balancing.
[8107.47s -> 8108.51s]  It's balancing.
[8109.78s -> 8113.47s]  On the edge of the sink.
[8113.47s -> 8115.79s]  And you dump the whole thing into it.
[8116.75s -> 8118.67s]  This person is trashed.
[8118.67s -> 8120.03s]  Or they're, yeah, wicked high.
[8122.35s -> 8124.11s]  And the thing is, what they should show is,
[8124.11s -> 8126.35s]  they should show, like, they should cut to the person's,
[8126.35s -> 8126.99s]  like, over here.
[8127.63s -> 8130.11s]  And just have them be like, with these red eyes.
[8130.11s -> 8133.78s]  And have them just go, I don't care.
[8134.58s -> 8135.86s]  And then reach into the sink and, like,
[8135.86s -> 8138.82s]  put it back into the strainer and put it on a plate.
[8138.82s -> 8139.94s]  Right, because, I mean, come on.
[8141.74s -> 8144.06s]  Making pasta is not a chore anymore.
[8144.06s -> 8145.02s]  Hi, Chef Tony.
[8145.02s -> 8146.38s]  We've got some Chef Tonys in a row.
[8146.38s -> 8150.38s]  The new way to make great pasta in as little as three minutes.
[8150.38s -> 8152.86s]  Simply add pasta, pour in boiling water,
[8152.86s -> 8154.30s]  and snap on the strainer lid.
[8154.30s -> 8154.62s]  What?
[8154.62s -> 8157.74s]  In no time, Pasta Fina cooks your pasta to perfection
[8157.74s -> 8158.94s]  right before your eyes.
[8158.94s -> 8162.30s]  Pasta Fina's unique vertical design surrounds the pasta
[8162.30s -> 8165.74s]  and uses thermal control to maintain the ideal temperature
[8165.74s -> 8166.78s]  for perfect pasta.
[8166.78s -> 8167.34s]  Does this work?
[8167.34s -> 8168.78s]  Just pop the top and drain.
[8168.78s -> 8170.22s]  No lumps or clumps.
[8170.22s -> 8171.02s]  Spaghetti.
[8171.02s -> 8172.06s]  All right, hold on.
[8172.06s -> 8173.02s]  Rigatoni.
[8173.02s -> 8174.14s]  Ravioli.
[8174.14s -> 8174.86s]  Macaroni.
[8174.86s -> 8176.14s]  Even tortellini.
[8176.14s -> 8178.78s]  All in as little as three minutes without the mess.
[8178.78s -> 8180.54s]  And pasta's just the start.
[8180.54s -> 8183.82s]  If you like veggies, Pasta Fina makes them fast and fresh.
[8183.82s -> 8184.46s]  Does that work?
[8184.46s -> 8185.26s]  Cheese and carrots.
[8185.26s -> 8186.22s]  Asparagus.
[8186.22s -> 8188.06s]  Even mixed vegetable medley.
[8188.06s -> 8190.86s]  And look, we cook broccoli the old fashioned way
[8190.86s -> 8192.62s]  and the Pasta Fina way.
[8192.62s -> 8193.98s]  Look at the water.
[8193.98s -> 8196.30s]  There is all your flavor and your nutrients,
[8196.30s -> 8198.14s]  but not the Pasta Fina way.
[8198.14s -> 8199.26s]  Look at the water.
[8199.26s -> 8200.22s]  Oh, yeah.
[8200.22s -> 8201.42s]  And look at the broccoli.
[8201.42s -> 8202.54s]  What do you mean, look at the water?
[8202.54s -> 8204.70s]  Bright, brilliant, and bursting with flavor.
[8204.70s -> 8206.86s]  Cook veggies and spaghetti at the same time.
[8207.82s -> 8209.10s]  Pasta from Nevada.
[8209.10s -> 8211.66s]  Even cook macaroni and sliced hot dogs together.
[8211.66s -> 8212.62s]  Add cheese.
[8212.62s -> 8214.14s]  Toss for mac and cheese.
[8214.14s -> 8215.34s]  That's sure to please.
[8215.34s -> 8218.70s]  And for cleanup, just a quick rinse or rack it in the dishwasher.
[8218.70s -> 8221.74s]  For a limited time, my Pasta Fina and complete recipe guide
[8221.74s -> 8223.90s]  are yours for just $10.
[8223.90s -> 8224.86s]  But wait, order in the next five minutes.
[8224.86s -> 8226.22s]  But this actually looks kind of useful.
[8226.22s -> 8229.34s]  And we'll send a second Pasta Fina and recipe guide for you
[8229.34s -> 8230.46s]  or to give us a gift.
[8230.46s -> 8233.41s]  Boiling water is annoying, right?
[8233.41s -> 8235.33s]  Let's just be, let's be real.
[8235.33s -> 8238.93s]  Boiling water is annoying.
[8238.93s -> 8241.71s]  It takes like a long time to boil water
[8241.71s -> 8244.03s]  unless you get like a kettle and boil it
[8244.03s -> 8244.99s]  and then pour, you know what I mean?
[8244.99s -> 8246.11s]  It takes a while.
[8246.11s -> 8247.79s]  It's a, this is a plastic tube.
[8247.79s -> 8248.11s]  I don't know.
[8250.77s -> 8251.81s]  It's obviously fake.
[8252.77s -> 8253.25s]  Is it though?
[8254.05s -> 8255.25s]  You have to boil water for this.
[8256.99s -> 8257.55s]  Wait, what?
[8259.18s -> 8261.10s]  Wait, it's not, wait a minute, hold on.
[8261.10s -> 8262.86s]  You boil the water and then pour it in.
[8264.54s -> 8265.58s]  Wait, it's not a machine?
[8268.06s -> 8269.66s]  You do pour in boiling water.
[8273.81s -> 8274.77s]  Oh, I missed that.
[8274.77s -> 8277.01s]  I thought this was like a device that you put the water in
[8277.01s -> 8278.93s]  and put this in and in three minutes you got pasta.
[8281.60s -> 8282.24s]  Okay, all right.
[8284.56s -> 8285.84s]  I thought you like turned it on.
[8291.60s -> 8292.16s]  Okay, all right.
[8293.04s -> 8294.80s]  It's interesting, but I don't think that's going to work.
[8296.72s -> 8298.08s]  All right, what about the fresh and crisp?
[8309.58s -> 8311.10s]  Is it an air freshener for your fridge?
[8317.58s -> 8318.30s]  Hold on.
[8318.30s -> 8319.74s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8322.06s -> 8324.26s]  Why is none of this covered?
[8326.42s -> 8328.82s]  You just open your fridge and just throw a head of open
[8328.82s -> 8331.14s]  just lettuce and a pineapple and like strawberry.
[8331.14s -> 8331.78s]  You don't cover it?
[8336.05s -> 8337.25s]  Why is it in the trash?
[8337.25s -> 8339.33s]  That's like throwing money away.
[8339.33s -> 8340.77s]  You need to put it like you need to cover it
[8340.77s -> 8342.45s]  and put it in like the humidifier thing.
[8348.29s -> 8349.17s]  18 days.
[8351.89s -> 8352.93s]  Just eat the, eat them.
[8357.09s -> 8358.93s]  Strawberries were bought at the same time.
[8358.93s -> 8360.13s]  Just look at the difference.
[8360.13s -> 8361.73s]  Oh, six dollars.
[8361.73s -> 8364.29s]  And look at iceberg lettuce after just eight days.
[8364.29s -> 8365.65s]  Fresh and crisp looks fresh.
[8365.65s -> 8367.89s]  No way that's another 250.
[8367.89s -> 8369.33s]  See the difference in these bananas.
[8369.33s -> 8371.73s]  The bunch stored with fresh and crisp is still fresh.
[8371.73s -> 8373.57s]  Okay, but what is the fresh and crisp?
[8373.57s -> 8373.97s]  What is it?
[8374.77s -> 8376.45s]  Baking soda is not the enemy.
[8376.45s -> 8379.09s]  It's the ethylene gas that's naturally given off
[8379.09s -> 8382.85s]  by fruits and veggies as they age in bags or in the fridge.
[8382.85s -> 8385.65s]  That gas is what makes your produce go bad.
[8385.73s -> 8389.01s]  The secret to fresh and crisp is in its proprietary technology
[8389.01s -> 8391.49s]  that uses mineral-based active ingredients
[8391.49s -> 8394.21s]  to trap and absorb that natural gas.
[8394.21s -> 8396.61s]  Dramatically slowing the aging process.
[8396.61s -> 8398.61s]  And fresh and crisp will last three months.
[8398.61s -> 8399.57s]  Baking soda in the fridge,
[8399.57s -> 8401.41s]  like an open thing of baking soda, they sell them.
[8401.41s -> 8404.53s]  That works for like odor and freshness.
[8404.53s -> 8406.37s]  And you'll save tons of money.
[8406.37s -> 8409.33s]  All of the fresh and fresh products are made in the USA.
[8409.33s -> 8411.17s]  Call or click to order right now
[8411.17s -> 8413.01s]  and we'll give you two fresh and crisps.
[8413.01s -> 8415.73s]  Enough to give you six months of freshness and savings
[8415.73s -> 8417.49s]  all for just $9.95.
[8417.49s -> 8418.93s]  But wait, just hold on.
[8418.93s -> 8421.25s]  Right now, we'll also send you fresh and fridge.
[8421.25s -> 8423.49s]  The amazing fridge and freezer odor-eliminating free.
[8423.49s -> 8424.45s]  That's baking soda.
[8424.45s -> 8426.61s]  Just place the fresh and fridge in any location
[8426.61s -> 8428.85s]  in your refrigerator or freezer to remove odors
[8428.85s -> 8429.89s]  and prevent odor cross-contamination on fruits and ice.
[8429.89s -> 8432.05s]  But how long does it last?
[8432.05s -> 8434.93s]  Laboratory tests prove fresh and fridge absorbs odors
[8434.93s -> 8437.57s]  97% more effectively than baking soda.
[8437.57s -> 8437.97s]  Hold on.
[8437.97s -> 8440.77s]  In fact, you'd need an entire fridge full of baking soda
[8440.77s -> 8442.85s]  to do the job of just one fresh and fridge.
[8442.85s -> 8444.37s]  Oh, fuck out of here.
[8444.37s -> 8447.01s]  You get two fresh and crisp produce savers
[8447.01s -> 8449.97s]  and the incredible fresh and fridge odor-eliminator.
[8449.97s -> 8451.73s]  I don't, I'd like to see the science.
[8451.73s -> 8452.93s]  All for just $9.95.
[8452.93s -> 8456.05s]  Call or click to order yours right now.
[8456.05s -> 8459.06s]  I'd like to see the science on that one.
[8459.06s -> 8459.86s]  If it works, cool.
[8459.86s -> 8461.14s]  I'd like to see some of the,
[8461.14s -> 8462.66s]  I'd like to know some of the science on that.
[8464.42s -> 8465.86s]  How about the no spill chill?
[8466.98s -> 8469.66s]  Oops, uh-oh, look out.
[8469.66s -> 8471.98s]  Oops, uh-oh, look out.
[8471.98s -> 8474.70s]  Let's face it, getting an ice cube tray to your freezer
[8475.42s -> 8475.92s]  Shit face.
[8480.78s -> 8484.30s]  The only difference is, this is not regular ice.
[8486.22s -> 8487.98s]  This is like, this person that with it,
[8487.98s -> 8489.18s]  they're just high or they're drunk
[8489.18s -> 8491.02s]  and they're just like, yeah, man, I got an idea.
[8491.76s -> 8498.16s]  Let's put a fruit punch and like Kahlua in these
[8498.16s -> 8499.68s]  and freeze, that'll be fucking awesome
[8499.68s -> 8500.72s]  in like a few hours, dude.
[8506.00s -> 8507.52s]  Revolutionary ice cube tube.
[8507.52s -> 8509.52s]  That's 100% spill proof.
[8509.52s -> 8510.56s]  Watch how easy.
[8510.56s -> 8511.60s]  Just fill the flexible.
[8511.60s -> 8512.88s]  That's not enough ice.
[8512.88s -> 8515.52s]  Slide in the ice cube insert and freeze.
[8515.52s -> 8516.72s]  Wow, what a breeze.
[8516.72s -> 8517.60s]  How many cubes is that?
[8517.60s -> 8521.12s]  Now look, just pop and the cubes drop directly into the cup.
[8521.12s -> 8522.00s]  It's that easy.
[8522.00s -> 8522.48s]  Not enough.
[8522.48s -> 8523.52s]  Grab that with a regular tray.
[8523.52s -> 8524.00s]  It was bigger.
[8524.00s -> 8526.72s]  Go ahead, pop and drop into any size glass.
[8526.72s -> 8528.64s]  Quickly prepare ice coffee for work
[8528.64s -> 8531.92s]  or create refreshing drinks without ever making a mess.
[8531.92s -> 8534.72s]  No spare chills, advanced interlocking technology.
[8534.72s -> 8536.24s]  That's really easy to fill up, though.
[8536.24s -> 8537.12s]  That's very easy.
[8537.12s -> 8538.96s]  Even over this expensive computer.
[8540.00s -> 8541.20s]  No, amazing.
[8541.20s -> 8541.84s]  The secret.
[8541.84s -> 8542.80s]  No spill chills.
[8542.80s -> 8546.64s]  Flexible sleeve and expensive computer inside.
[8546.64s -> 8547.44s]  So they always.
[8547.44s -> 8548.96s]  How expensive is this computer?
[8548.96s -> 8550.00s]  Divided insert.
[8550.00s -> 8551.68s]  Secure the cubes inside.
[8551.68s -> 8553.44s]  So not a single.
[8553.44s -> 8556.48s]  Oh, this expensive JPEG of a computer.
[8556.48s -> 8556.96s]  I see.
[8556.96s -> 8558.32s]  Drop amazing.
[8558.32s -> 8558.96s]  The secret.
[8558.96s -> 8559.92s]  No spill chills.
[8559.92s -> 8563.28s]  Flexible sleeve and divided insert that secure the cubes.
[8563.28s -> 8568.08s]  If this was two, if this was a double and it was a little longer,
[8568.08s -> 8569.60s]  I'd probably be into it.
[8569.60s -> 8570.72s]  I guess maybe you get a bunch.
[8570.72s -> 8572.72s]  Flat, vertical, upside down.
[8572.72s -> 8574.40s]  Anywhere in your freezer.
[8574.40s -> 8576.64s]  They're even fitted to stack and store.
[8576.64s -> 8578.24s]  Perfect for home, office.
[8578.24s -> 8582.00s]  Yeah, I mean like a small fridge.
[8582.00s -> 8584.40s]  We all love homemade soups and sauces,
[8584.40s -> 8587.68s]  but who wants to stand in front of the stove for hours stirring?
[8587.68s -> 8591.28s]  And if you happen to step away, you can end up burning your food.
[8591.28s -> 8592.24s]  For one second.
[8596.80s -> 8597.12s]  What?
[8610.64s -> 8611.60s]  This is ridiculous.
[8616.80s -> 8618.00s]  That's not really stirring.
[8618.80s -> 8620.00s]  It's kind of just moving around.
[8621.44s -> 8625.52s]  It's battery operated and so sturdy it can stir for up to four hours
[8625.52s -> 8628.40s]  and stand heat up to five hundred and seventy two degrees.
[8628.40s -> 8631.68s]  Four hours on your back on your food and it won't burn.
[8631.68s -> 8635.60s]  Robuster is great for gravy soup for soups and stews and for beans.
[8635.60s -> 8638.16s]  It's the best mixed marinara masala.
[8638.16s -> 8641.60s]  It even has the straight fold alfredo and turn your cheese sauce.
[8641.60s -> 8646.88s]  The secrets, the orbital gyroscopic action that ensures no spot is unstirred or untouched.
[8646.88s -> 8650.72s]  From underneath, you can see how the Robuster keeps everything moving.
[8651.68s -> 8654.08s]  So I don't even say with the Robuster,
[8654.08s -> 8658.56s]  you finally have that third hand in the kitchen so you can get two things done at once.
[8658.56s -> 8660.32s]  Cleanups easy and it's dish.
[8660.32s -> 8660.88s]  I don't know.
[8660.88s -> 8664.56s]  I don't even say it stirs so you don't have to.
[8665.28s -> 8670.56s]  I mean, it's just I guess it's like solves some kind of issue.
[8673.31s -> 8674.83s]  But I mean, how many pans do you have out?
[8674.83s -> 8675.47s]  Like, what do you do?
[8675.47s -> 8676.43s]  How much food are you making?
[8676.43s -> 8680.83s]  I'm making a lot of different things.
[8680.83s -> 8682.83s]  All right, we got the Shogun steamer.
[8683.79s -> 8687.01s]  This is the urn that they just repurpose it.
[8687.01s -> 8688.50s]  We already see this.
[8689.22s -> 8693.78s]  Now you can enjoy all the flavors and healthy benefits of ancient cooking secrets
[8693.78s -> 8695.94s]  right from your microwave in just minutes.
[8695.94s -> 8698.42s]  It's the same fucking product.
[8698.42s -> 8702.10s]  It's the modern version of this timeless classic and it cooks meat,
[8702.10s -> 8706.66s]  fish and vegetables, even frozen foods faster and better than a dozen pots and pans.
[8706.66s -> 8708.26s]  Is the impossible.
[8708.26s -> 8712.34s]  Watch on the left boiling water on the right, the Shogun steamer.
[8712.34s -> 8714.10s]  We place fresh veggies in both.
[8714.10s -> 8716.90s]  And a few minutes later, the vegetables are soggy.
[8716.90s -> 8719.38s]  But the Shogun steamer done perfectly.
[8719.38s -> 8722.18s]  Vitamins and color don't have a chance to boil away.
[8722.18s -> 8724.26s]  These fish fillets are frozen solid.
[8724.26s -> 8726.74s]  One goes in the oven, the other in the steamer.
[8726.74s -> 8729.30s]  Minutes later, the oven fish is cold as a pot.
[8729.30s -> 8730.18s]  Minutes later.
[8730.18s -> 8732.18s]  The steamer fillet is done to perfection.
[8732.18s -> 8736.30s]  Minutes later, did you stop it before it was done?
[8736.30s -> 8740.61s]  You can't put the same rules on two different cooking appliances.
[8740.61s -> 8743.89s]  Hey, look, we put this frozen salmon in the oven for three minutes
[8743.89s -> 8747.41s]  and we put this frozen salmon in this in the Shogun streamer for three minutes.
[8747.41s -> 8750.54s]  And look at the difference.
[8750.54s -> 8753.50s]  You can't apply the same rules to different appliances.
[8753.50s -> 8755.07s]  Is that what they're implying?
[8755.07s -> 8756.72s]  No, it can't be right.
[8756.72s -> 8758.00s]  Are frozen solid.
[8758.00s -> 8760.48s]  One goes in the oven, the other in the steamer.
[8760.48s -> 8763.52s]  Minutes later, the oven fish is cold as a popsicle.
[8763.52s -> 8765.92s]  But the steamer fillet is done to perfection.
[8765.92s -> 8769.92s]  Simply add water, then choose the larger small basket depending on your meal.
[8769.92s -> 8771.92s]  Then pop it in the microwave and press.
[8771.92s -> 8774.32s]  And the Shogun steamer does the rest.
[8774.32s -> 8775.20s]  Is it magic?
[8775.20s -> 8776.48s]  No, it's science.
[8776.48s -> 8777.44s]  You see boiling.
[8777.44s -> 8778.00s]  No, it's.
[8779.84s -> 8781.36s]  All right, listen to the audio stop.
[8781.36s -> 8783.04s]  Listen to the audio splice.
[8783.04s -> 8783.92s]  Is it magic?
[8783.92s -> 8786.48s]  No, no.
[8787.86s -> 8788.74s]  Is it magic?
[8788.74s -> 8792.03s]  No, it's the steam technology.
[8792.03s -> 8792.83s]  Is it magic?
[8792.83s -> 8794.11s]  No, listen to this.
[8794.11s -> 8794.83s]  The rest.
[8794.83s -> 8795.71s]  Is it magic?
[8795.71s -> 8796.27s]  No, it's.
[8798.86s -> 8801.98s]  No, is it magic?
[8801.98s -> 8803.90s]  No, steamer does the rest.
[8803.90s -> 8804.78s]  Is it magic?
[8804.78s -> 8806.06s]  No, it's science.
[8806.06s -> 8807.58s]  You see boiling water is hot.
[8807.58s -> 8808.22s]  What was wrong there?
[8808.22s -> 8809.98s]  Steam is hotter, so it cooks faster.
[8810.22s -> 8811.10s]  Why did they need a dubter?
[8811.10s -> 8812.38s]  It washes away vitamins and flavor.
[8812.38s -> 8813.82s]  Steaming locks them in.
[8813.82s -> 8816.86s]  So your meals taste twice as good in half the time.
[8816.86s -> 8819.82s]  And the twist and drain feature lets you save the broth.
[8819.82s -> 8822.62s]  And it makes perfect pasta every time.
[8822.62s -> 8824.54s]  Enjoy a delicious seafood feast.
[8824.54s -> 8825.10s]  It's the same.
[8825.10s -> 8825.50s]  We saw it.
[8825.50s -> 8826.70s]  We see a lot already with the thing.
[8826.70s -> 8827.66s]  Perfectly done rice and potatoes.
[8827.66s -> 8828.86s]  With the drain at the bottom.
[8828.86s -> 8831.58s]  The Shogun steamer replaces a cabinet full of pots and pans.
[8831.58s -> 8833.66s]  And it's just $19.95.
[8833.66s -> 8836.94s]  Plus, you get our Shogun 10-Minute Meals Cookbook.
[8836.94s -> 8838.78s]  Packed with easy and healthy meals.
[8838.86s -> 8840.06s]  And as if that weren't enough...
[8840.06s -> 8847.10s]  Yeah, all they did was change the name to the Shogun steamer.
[8850.59s -> 8853.07s]  They added like a gong in the commercial.
[8853.07s -> 8856.75s]  That's the only difference between the two commercials.
[8859.09s -> 8860.21s]  What was the point of that?
[8860.21s -> 8862.05s]  Two steamers and two cookbooks.
[8862.05s -> 8863.81s]  Just basic processing and handling.
[8863.81s -> 8866.13s]  You must agree it's the most time-saving,
[8866.13s -> 8868.53s]  flavor-sealing cooking tool you've ever used
[8868.53s -> 8870.45s]  or return it for a full refund.
[8870.45s -> 8873.33s]  But keep as a free gift our handy cut-and-cut chopper.
[8874.05s -> 8874.93s]  These are ridiculous.
[8874.93s -> 8875.57s]  These are so...
[8875.57s -> 8877.86s]  I love this.
[8877.86s -> 8879.86s]  Okay, how about the Miracle Grill Mat?
[8879.86s -> 8883.65s]  Do you love to grill but hate the messy cleanup?
[8883.65s -> 8884.61s]  All right, we got Mark Gill here.
[8884.61s -> 8886.69s]  First of all, it gets one full letter grade.
[8887.41s -> 8889.73s]  Do you love to grill but hate the messy cleanup?
[8889.73s -> 8890.45s]  Me too!
[8890.45s -> 8892.93s]  Hi, Mark Gill here for the Miracle Grill Mat.
[8892.93s -> 8893.65s]  It takes any grill...
[8893.65s -> 8894.45s]  These green screens somewhere.
[8894.45s -> 8896.45s]  ...and makes it completely non-stick.
[8896.45s -> 8896.77s]  And...
[8896.77s -> 8897.25s]  Where is he?
[8897.25s -> 8898.37s]  ...it eliminates cleanup.
[8898.37s -> 8900.29s]  Here's something you could never do at home.
[8900.29s -> 8902.77s]  I'm gonna do breakfast on my barbecue.
[8902.77s -> 8903.33s]  I'm even gonna add...
[8903.33s -> 8904.05s]  Oh, it's like a mat?
[8904.05s -> 8904.77s]  ...an egg.
[8904.77s -> 8905.73s]  Look at that.
[8905.73s -> 8908.05s]  And for a special treat, in just a second,
[8908.05s -> 8909.89s]  a little bit of shredded cheese.
[8909.89s -> 8911.81s]  I've even got my crispy bacon,
[8911.81s -> 8913.41s]  my savory hash browns.
[8913.41s -> 8914.77s]  If you come to the other side,
[8914.77s -> 8915.89s]  I have french toast,
[8915.89s -> 8916.53s]  sausage,
[8916.53s -> 8917.57s]  wonderful ham,
[8917.57s -> 8918.53s]  tangy pineapple,
[8918.53s -> 8919.09s]  and toast.
[8919.09s -> 8920.93s]  A whole breakfast for the entire family!
[8920.93s -> 8921.25s]  Stop!
[8921.25s -> 8922.13s]  On my barbecue!
[8922.13s -> 8922.61s]  By the way...
[8923.65s -> 8926.21s]  I don't know if anybody's household was like this or not,
[8926.21s -> 8927.62s]  but like...
[8927.62s -> 8930.88s]  I'm sorry, my like mother or father
[8930.88s -> 8933.92s]  is not going to make like separate fucking breakfasts
[8933.92s -> 8935.52s]  for six different people.
[8936.93s -> 8939.25s]  Oh, you got your ham and pineapple for Jerry.
[8939.25s -> 8941.17s]  You've got your cheese quesadilla
[8941.17s -> 8944.77s]  and eggs over here for Sally.
[8944.77s -> 8946.05s]  Oh, and then you got your french toast.
[8946.05s -> 8947.73s]  Like, who the fuck is doing that?
[8947.73s -> 8948.85s]  My mother's gonna...
[8948.85s -> 8952.46s]  My mother's making like scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast.
[8952.46s -> 8953.42s]  I'm not being like,
[8953.42s -> 8957.02s]  Mom, can I have pineapple and ham instead?
[8957.02s -> 8957.26s]  Why?
[8957.26s -> 8959.18s]  They always show making like eight breakfasts
[8959.18s -> 8962.40s]  for eight different people.
[8962.40s -> 8963.28s]  No, you're just gonna be...
[8963.28s -> 8965.84s]  You're gonna get what mom or dad makes.
[8965.84s -> 8967.17s]  That's not how this works.
[8967.17s -> 8968.69s]  They're probably on my barbecue!
[8969.65s -> 8971.14s]  Hey, you want non-stick?
[8971.70s -> 8973.54s]  Mom, I want a ham steak today with pineapple.
[8973.54s -> 8974.58s]  And I still got my grill lines.
[8974.58s -> 8974.82s]  Okay.
[8974.82s -> 8976.42s]  Now, remember that special treat?
[8976.42s -> 8978.58s]  Watch the egg right into the cheese.
[8978.58s -> 8979.78s]  I'm gonna grab my toast.
[8980.42s -> 8983.38s]  Toast, eggs, and cheese on my miracle grill mat,
[8983.38s -> 8985.86s]  and nothing sticks.
[8985.86s -> 8986.18s]  Whoa!
[8986.18s -> 8987.06s]  Are you kidding me?
[8987.06s -> 8988.42s]  Are you kidding me?
[8988.42s -> 8991.06s]  Delicious, and I never have to clean my...
[8991.06s -> 8992.18s]  Are you kidding me?
[8992.18s -> 8994.42s]  Ooey, gooey, delicious,
[8994.42s -> 8996.98s]  and I never have to clean my barbecue again.
[8996.98s -> 8997.62s]  Grill lines.
[8998.58s -> 9002.58s]  Everybody loves thick, juicy, restaurant-quality steak.
[9002.58s -> 9004.10s]  Restaurant-quality steak.
[9004.10s -> 9005.14s]  Restaurant-quality.
[9005.14s -> 9006.82s]  Restaurant-quality shrimp.
[9006.82s -> 9008.58s]  Restaurant-quality steak.
[9008.58s -> 9009.95s]  A steak is a steak.
[9009.95s -> 9010.67s]  Let's just...
[9010.67s -> 9012.64s]  We have to clear this up too.
[9012.64s -> 9016.26s]  If you go buy like a ribeye somewhere,
[9016.26s -> 9017.94s]  it's of the same...
[9017.94s -> 9020.29s]  It's a ribeye.
[9020.29s -> 9022.53s]  Restaurant-quality steak.
[9022.53s -> 9023.33s]  It's just a ribeye.
[9023.33s -> 9026.40s]  It's not like a special thing.
[9026.40s -> 9028.83s]  It's just a ribeye.
[9028.83s -> 9031.47s]  Onions and mushrooms right beside my steak.
[9032.11s -> 9032.67s]  How's that wrong?
[9032.67s -> 9033.63s]  Wait a minute for a second.
[9033.63s -> 9035.47s]  Grilled vegetables are amazing,
[9035.47s -> 9038.51s]  but trying to do them on an open grate is almost impossible.
[9038.51s -> 9039.63s]  Oh no, Mark.
[9039.63s -> 9040.51s]  They'll just fall through.
[9040.51s -> 9041.95s]  You'll need half your meal.
[9041.95s -> 9042.91s]  Have a look at this.
[9042.91s -> 9046.03s]  With the miracle grill mat, everything stays in place.
[9046.03s -> 9048.75s]  I can grill my vegetables right beside my meat.
[9048.75s -> 9050.03s]  I never lose a bite of food.
[9050.03s -> 9050.27s]  And here's the best part.
[9050.27s -> 9051.15s]  I can see this for like...
[9051.15s -> 9052.19s]  I never lose that great barbecue flavor.
[9052.19s -> 9053.87s]  Yeah, vegetables and fish and stuff.
[9053.87s -> 9054.51s]  That makes sense.
[9054.51s -> 9056.99s]  Flare-ups can ruin your meat and your hair.
[9056.99s -> 9057.15s]  What?
[9057.15s -> 9058.43s]  So with the miracle grill mat,
[9058.43s -> 9059.79s]  there's never any flare-ups.
[9059.79s -> 9062.91s]  And burnt-on sauces and marinades make for a cleaning nightmare.
[9062.91s -> 9064.11s]  But check this out.
[9064.11s -> 9067.31s]  With the miracle grill mat, clean up is a snap.
[9068.99s -> 9071.15s]  If you've ever tried to grill fish, you know.
[9071.15s -> 9072.91s]  It just flakes and falls apart.
[9072.91s -> 9077.79s]  But with the miracle grill mat, you get perfect fish every time.
[9077.79s -> 9080.67s]  You've seen just some of what the miracle grill mat can do.
[9080.67s -> 9082.99s]  Now get your very own miracle grill mat.
[9082.99s -> 9084.19s]  There's applications for it.
[9084.19s -> 9085.95s]  I mean, you can just use tin foil, right?
[9085.95s -> 9086.19s]  Yeah.
[9091.47s -> 9093.63s]  Yeah, and then just throw the tin foil away.
[9093.63s -> 9096.59s]  You have to like clean this thing.
[9098.38s -> 9101.34s]  That's true.
[9101.34s -> 9101.74s]  All right.
[9101.74s -> 9103.02s]  Fresh toppers.
[9103.02s -> 9111.47s]  No matter what containers you buy, you end up with this, this, or this.
[9111.47s -> 9112.51s]  Not anymore.
[9112.51s -> 9113.15s]  What?
[9113.15s -> 9116.67s]  Introducing the fresh toppers, the ingenious new food saver.
[9116.67s -> 9120.59s]  Fresh toppers pops right on your food to instantly seal in freshness.
[9120.59s -> 9124.91s]  Wait, you put it on top of an orange?
[9124.91s -> 9127.39s]  The one on the left was stored in a plastic container.
[9127.39s -> 9130.51s]  The one on the right, it's open to the air, isn't it?
[9130.67s -> 9131.39s]  Plastic wrap?
[9131.39s -> 9132.99s]  That's a storage trap.
[9132.99s -> 9134.19s]  Just fresh top them.
[9134.19s -> 9137.71s]  Fresh toppers form a protective seal like your food's natural skin.
[9137.71s -> 9139.47s]  Top on any fruit or vegetable.
[9139.47s -> 9140.91s]  Top on cans and jars.
[9140.91s -> 9141.95s]  Top on to seal on air.
[9141.95s -> 9142.59s]  Okay, jars.
[9142.59s -> 9144.75s]  I can see jars and jars make sense.
[9144.75s -> 9145.71s]  Fresh toppers keep odors in.
[9145.71s -> 9147.15s]  They're FDA approved.
[9147.15s -> 9147.87s]  Yummy.
[9147.87s -> 9151.63s]  Dishwashers safe and so easy to store in a shelf or in a drawer.
[9151.63s -> 9151.71s]  Cans.
[9151.71s -> 9153.47s]  What container can say that?
[9153.47s -> 9156.91s]  Now it's easy to top fruits and vegetables with fresh toppers.
[9156.91s -> 9158.59s]  I love my fresh toppers.
[9158.59s -> 9159.79s]  Why do I feel like this would be kind of hard to get off?
[9160.75s -> 9163.55s]  I feel like I'd have to like peel.
[9163.55s -> 9165.47s]  I feel like I'd be paying the ass to get off on some stuff.
[9166.91s -> 9168.03s]  Why they keep smelling?
[9168.03s -> 9168.91s]  Stop sniffing it.
[9171.07s -> 9171.63s]  That's weird.
[9171.63s -> 9172.19s]  I don't like that.
[9172.19s -> 9174.43s]  Money and keep your food fresher longer.
[9174.43s -> 9176.59s]  Call and order fresh toppers today for only $10.
[9177.23s -> 9178.19s]  How many do you get though?
[9178.99s -> 9181.95s]  Because if you only get like four, you get four.
[9185.14s -> 9192.13s]  Okay, let's preserve one half tomato and like a lime.
[9192.13s -> 9195.25s]  That's not enough.
[9196.21s -> 9198.05s]  Colors tomato, red, carrot, orange.
[9198.05s -> 9198.77s]  It's going to be double.
[9198.77s -> 9199.81s]  It's going to be green.
[9199.81s -> 9200.85s]  But wait, there's more.
[9200.85s -> 9204.37s]  Can be a call now and we'll include this three piece stainless steel knife set.
[9204.37s -> 9205.41s]  Exactly what I told you before.
[9206.45s -> 9208.13s]  Precisely what we talked about.
[9208.13s -> 9208.69s]  Precisely.
[9210.93s -> 9212.29s]  This is a different product.
[9212.29s -> 9215.89s]  This is a knife set that this is also now what you have now too.
[9217.31s -> 9218.83s]  It's completely different product.
[9218.83s -> 9220.43s]  Perfect for cutting any produce.
[9220.43s -> 9222.03s]  A $25 value.
[9222.03s -> 9224.59s]  Just pay separate processing, but that's not all.
[9224.59s -> 9226.51s]  Order now and we'll double your order.
[9227.47s -> 9229.07s]  And more knives.
[9229.07s -> 9231.15s]  Two tomato, red, two carrot, orange.
[9231.15s -> 9232.35s]  We've got to get rid of some inventory.
[9232.35s -> 9235.47s]  Two pepper green and two three piece knife sets.
[9235.47s -> 9237.39s]  All for only $10.
[9237.39s -> 9239.79s]  This offer is not available in stores.
[9239.79s -> 9240.59s]  Don't wait.
[9240.59s -> 9243.79s]  Okay, I still feel like this kind of odd weird number of stuff.
[9246.90s -> 9250.74s]  All right, we're probably going to move away from kitchen appliances.
[9250.74s -> 9251.78s]  I got this tons to go through.
[9251.78s -> 9253.25s]  Don't worry.
[9253.25s -> 9255.17s]  But there's other stuff too.
[9255.17s -> 9259.04s]  There's other products that are not just in the kitchen.
[9259.04s -> 9260.80s]  Big Boss Sliceroo.
[9260.88s -> 9269.57s]  Are you tired of spending all your time slicing and dicing and shredding and chopping?
[9269.57s -> 9273.57s]  Tired of those other so-called slicers that can be dangerous?
[9273.57s -> 9275.97s]  Well, say goodbye to all of that.
[9275.97s -> 9278.29s]  Introducing Sliceroo.
[9278.29s -> 9283.09s]  In seconds, you can slice onions, apples, potatoes, and cucumbers.
[9283.09s -> 9284.53s]  Shred cabbage, carrots, and beans.
[9284.53s -> 9285.57s]  They're fighting each other now.
[9285.57s -> 9287.73s]  And curl zucchini, squash, potato.
[9287.73s -> 9288.69s]  They're fighting each other now.
[9288.69s -> 9292.13s]  Turn your meal time into fun time with the Sliceroo.
[9292.61s -> 9294.61s]  This is not the vej-ju...
[9295.65s -> 9296.29s]  Wait a minute.
[9298.26s -> 9299.30s]  Wait a minute.
[9299.30s -> 9310.67s]  This is the vej-ju-roo?
[9313.09s -> 9314.37s]  No, it's the vegetti.
[9316.13s -> 9317.73s]  I thought this was the vej-ju-roo.
[9324.30s -> 9324.62s]  Okay.
[9324.62s -> 9325.74s]  Well, we already know that one.
[9325.74s -> 9327.18s]  We don't need to see that one again.
[9327.18s -> 9331.06s]  The Big Boss Sliceroo.
[9331.06s -> 9332.74s]  All right, the Stone Wave.
[9332.74s -> 9334.98s]  Hi, Mark Gill here.
[9334.98s -> 9335.46s]  There he is.
[9335.46s -> 9336.26s]  The Stone Wave.
[9336.26s -> 9340.82s]  The new ceramic cooker with the steam-released chimney that makes dishes so delicious
[9340.82s -> 9342.74s]  you'll crave cooking in the Wave.
[9342.90s -> 9345.14s]  Poached eggs are such a pain to make.
[9345.14s -> 9345.86s]  They are, but...
[9345.86s -> 9347.38s]  Put an egg into Stone Wave.
[9347.38s -> 9349.62s]  No need for butter, fats, or oil.
[9349.62s -> 9351.78s]  Just pop it in the microwave for one minute.
[9351.78s -> 9355.25s]  Eddly smooth, velvety poached egg.
[9355.25s -> 9356.21s]  Stone Wave is non-stick.
[9356.21s -> 9356.69s]  Is it po...
[9356.69s -> 9357.89s]  That's a poached egg.
[9357.89s -> 9358.69s]  The legs just fly right off.
[9358.69s -> 9362.29s]  Let's just add your favorite ingredient and cook.
[9362.29s -> 9364.53s]  The hollow handle stays cool enough to hold.
[9364.53s -> 9366.21s]  Look how fluffy that is.
[9366.21s -> 9367.89s]  Eat it right out of the Stone Wave.
[9367.89s -> 9369.57s]  No pans and no dishes.
[9371.41s -> 9374.45s]  The secret is the unique chimney releasing just the right amount
[9374.45s -> 9375.09s]  of steam.
[9375.09s -> 9377.09s]  The domed lid recirculates heat.
[9377.09s -> 9378.85s]  Cooking food to perfection.
[9378.85s -> 9380.61s]  Look, it recirculates heat.
[9382.37s -> 9384.21s]  Why does it always look like they don't like it?
[9387.31s -> 9391.33s]  Those eyes tell me, like, not very good.
[9391.33s -> 9394.45s]  The unique chimney releasing just the right amount of steam.
[9394.45s -> 9396.85s]  The domed lid recirculates heat.
[9396.85s -> 9398.21s]  Watch out, it's going to blow up.
[9399.50s -> 9400.30s]  It's going to get too high.
[9406.88s -> 9408.72s]  All right, now that's application.
[9409.60s -> 9411.20s]  If you like apple pie, I see it.
[9416.51s -> 9417.87s]  Or like a s'more or something.
[9422.77s -> 9423.89s]  A little soup too?
[9423.89s -> 9424.53s]  Like a little...
[9424.53s -> 9425.33s]  Okay, hold on.
[9427.82s -> 9428.30s]  How do you do that?
[9430.59s -> 9431.47s]  How did you do that?
[9431.47s -> 9432.51s]  How do you do that?
[9432.51s -> 9433.23s]  How did he do that?
[9439.15s -> 9439.79s]  How did you do that?
[9445.63s -> 9446.43s]  Recipe book.
[9446.43s -> 9449.79s]  You get the amazing ceramic stone wave and recipe book.
[9449.79s -> 9450.43s]  It's going to get cut off.
[9452.35s -> 9452.83s]  Mr. T?
[9457.31s -> 9458.03s]  Are we going to get another...
[9458.59s -> 9460.99s]  and cooking and cleaning up the mess.
[9460.99s -> 9463.39s]  Well, I challenged some friends of mine
[9463.39s -> 9465.31s]  to come up with a cooking invention
[9465.31s -> 9467.55s]  that would make it super easy for me
[9467.55s -> 9469.39s]  to whip up a tasty meal
[9469.39s -> 9472.59s]  quick enough to hit off a big fierce appetite.
[9473.23s -> 9475.55s]  Another like celebrity cooking thing?
[9477.31s -> 9477.79s]  What is it?
[9482.08s -> 9482.40s]  Whoa!
[9489.10s -> 9491.50s]  The flavor wave turbo is not a microwave,
[9491.50s -> 9492.70s]  but an amazing invention
[9492.70s -> 9494.30s]  that combines three types of cooking
[9494.30s -> 9496.22s]  to turbo cook all your favorite foods
[9496.22s -> 9499.02s]  up to three times faster with no added fat.
[9499.02s -> 9502.38s]  Mr. T is giving it a good effort here, I think.
[9502.38s -> 9503.50s]  ...right from the freezer
[9503.50s -> 9504.94s]  and have it fully cooked for you
[9504.94s -> 9507.18s]  three times faster than an ordinary oven.
[9507.18s -> 9509.74s]  Plus, it eliminates 75% of the fat.
[9509.74s -> 9511.90s]  Imagine mouth-watering turkey in 20 minutes.
[9511.90s -> 9513.18s]  Eliminate all the fat?
[9516.78s -> 9517.98s]  Is this a food processor?
[9518.94s -> 9521.02s]  Now, whether your food is fresh or frozen,
[9521.02s -> 9523.58s]  you can bake, broil, roast, toast,
[9523.58s -> 9526.62s]  sear, brown, barbecue, reheat, and more.
[9526.62s -> 9527.90s]  Faster than ever before.
[9527.90s -> 9528.54s]  That's weird looking.
[9528.54s -> 9529.82s]  Best of all, when you're all done cooking,
[9529.82s -> 9530.62s]  guess what?
[9530.62s -> 9533.34s]  The flavor wave actually cleans up for you.
[9533.34s -> 9533.58s]  What?
[9533.58s -> 9536.38s]  The flavor wave turbo oven is life-changing
[9536.38s -> 9538.22s]  because I can throw dinner together
[9538.22s -> 9539.82s]  in a matter of minutes
[9539.82s -> 9541.34s]  straight from the freezer
[9541.34s -> 9543.74s]  right into the flavor wave turbo oven to cook.
[9543.74s -> 9544.70s]  I really like the fact
[9544.70s -> 9546.14s]  that the flavor wave turbo oven
[9546.14s -> 9547.82s]  defrosts frozen foods.
[9547.90s -> 9549.34s]  I could just put something...
[9549.34s -> 9550.30s]  It's an air fryer.
[9550.30s -> 9551.90s]  ...from the freezer into the flavor...
[9551.90s -> 9553.98s]  Was this an air fryer before air fryers?
[9553.98s -> 9556.78s]  I don't use any fats or oils in the flavor wave turbo.
[9556.78s -> 9557.18s]  Don't ever.
[9557.18s -> 9558.22s]  And that's quite surprising
[9558.22s -> 9559.26s]  because you don't need them.
[9559.26s -> 9560.78s]  No, who needs, like, fucking flavor?
[9561.66s -> 9562.78s]  No, I don't use any marinades.
[9562.78s -> 9564.86s]  I don't use any fats, any oils, any butter.
[9564.86s -> 9566.06s]  I don't season the meat either.
[9566.06s -> 9569.50s]  I just put in a frozen chunk of chicken leg
[9569.50s -> 9571.02s]  and the machine just does the whole thing.
[9571.02s -> 9572.46s]  And I eat it and it's dry as fuck
[9572.46s -> 9573.89s]  and it has no flavor
[9573.89s -> 9575.09s]  and no fats and no oils.
[9575.09s -> 9576.69s]  And get all that out of here.
[9576.69s -> 9582.06s]  I want it to be like a dry ass chicken.
[9582.06s -> 9585.62s]  Wait, what's this end here?
[9585.62s -> 9586.50s]  This ending.
[9586.50s -> 9590.78s]  It just comes out wonderful.
[9590.78s -> 9591.58s]  The push and prep.
[9592.46s -> 9593.34s]  Oh, more cutting.
[9593.34s -> 9595.02s]  It's a pain in the ass.
[9595.02s -> 9597.10s]  Oh, you're gonna slice your fucking hand off.
[9598.22s -> 9599.10s]  It's just a spawn.
[9599.10s -> 9601.34s]  Push and prep, the new miracle cutting tool
[9601.34s -> 9604.62s]  that lets you chop, slice, dice, mince in seconds.
[9604.62s -> 9607.34s]  This tower of power is actually three cutting blades
[9607.34s -> 9609.74s]  in one compact stack designed to double the...
[9609.74s -> 9611.02s]  Oh, we're getting duplicates.
[9611.42s -> 9612.80s]  Watch, just click in the...
[9612.80s -> 9614.32s]  These things do work though.
[9614.32s -> 9615.52s]  It's that easy to...
[9615.52s -> 9618.24s]  They're just, I mean, there's a lot of them.
[9618.24s -> 9620.80s]  Look, the quarter blade to push and prep
[9620.80s -> 9622.30s]  and through potatoes...
[9622.30s -> 9623.66s]  Is it repost?
[9623.66s -> 9625.42s]  I mean, I think it's a different company.
[9625.42s -> 9627.74s]  ...for zesty zucchini sticks, french fries,
[9627.74s -> 9629.18s]  or sweet potato fries.
[9629.18s -> 9631.90s]  Use the slicing blade to power through peppers.
[9631.90s -> 9633.82s]  I think most of these are early 2000s, mid 2000s.
[9633.82s -> 9636.30s]  Push and prep for the fastest veggies yet.
[9636.30s -> 9638.38s]  Slice even the toughest pineapple.
[9638.38s -> 9640.70s]  Slice and dice peppers, tomatoes and onions
[9640.70s -> 9642.22s]  for a spicy salsa.
[9642.22s -> 9643.26s]  With sure grip handle,
[9643.26s -> 9645.50s]  the stay sharp stainless steel blades even cut...
[9645.50s -> 9646.86s]  Yeah, we've seen this already.
[9648.58s -> 9650.34s]  The best pot pie maker.
[9650.34s -> 9650.98s]  Oh, yup.
[9652.06s -> 9652.46s]  Let's go.
[9655.02s -> 9656.06s]  Why is he on the phone?
[9658.72s -> 9660.64s]  Wait, why did he call in?
[9660.64s -> 9663.52s]  Why did Chef Tony call into the infomercial?
[9663.52s -> 9667.17s]  It's like, was it radio?
[9667.17s -> 9669.90s]  Was he like being interviewed on a radio station?
[9669.90s -> 9670.86s]  Why is he calling in?
[9675.22s -> 9679.15s]  Do you love delicious mouth-watering hot pot pie?
[9679.15s -> 9679.95s]  But he's here.
[9679.95s -> 9682.66s]  But store-bought pot pies have lots of potatoes
[9682.66s -> 9684.27s]  and fill as you may not want.
[9684.27s -> 9685.95s]  And where's that beef?
[9685.95s -> 9686.51s]  What beef?
[9686.51s -> 9688.03s]  Why, Chef Tony, for best pot pie...
[9688.03s -> 9688.67s]  He's calling...
[9688.67s -> 9689.47s]  ...now you can enjoy...
[9699.52s -> 9704.53s]  He's calling from prison.
[9706.38s -> 9709.39s]  There's nothing better to make with holiday left
[9709.39s -> 9710.59s]  than my best pot pie.
[9710.59s -> 9711.79s]  He had to finish the commercial.
[9711.79s -> 9714.59s]  He's contractually obligated to finish the commercial.
[9715.15s -> 9718.35s]  Do you love delicious mouth-watering hot pot pie?
[9718.35s -> 9721.15s]  But store-bought pot pies have lots of potatoes.
[9721.71s -> 9723.31s]  Oh, that's not fair.
[9723.31s -> 9724.43s]  He seems like a really nice guy.
[9724.43s -> 9724.91s]  He really does.
[9724.91s -> 9735.82s]  But Chef Tony, just use the crust cover to package the homemade dough
[9735.82s -> 9737.02s]  to form the bottom.
[9737.02s -> 9738.06s]  Spoon in your favorite...
[9738.06s -> 9738.30s]  Why?
[9738.30s -> 9739.98s]  But that was so weird.
[9739.98s -> 9740.78s]  ...veggies...
[9740.78s -> 9742.30s]  Why have a call-in segment?
[9742.30s -> 9743.02s]  What the fuck?
[9743.90s -> 9746.38s]  Now, just heat them up and eat them up.
[9747.50s -> 9749.26s]  The best pot pie.
[9749.26s -> 9751.34s]  Make best pot pie your way.
[9751.34s -> 9753.50s]  Skip the carrots, load up on the peas.
[9753.50s -> 9754.38s]  Skip the carrots?
[9754.38s -> 9755.66s]  What are you, crazy Tony?
[9755.66s -> 9758.22s]  ...into delicious new meals
[9758.22s -> 9759.74s]  for the whole family.
[9759.74s -> 9762.38s]  Make an amazing quiche for Sunday brunch
[9762.38s -> 9764.06s]  filled with your favorites.
[9764.06s -> 9764.46s]  Ham, cheese...
[9764.46s -> 9765.42s]  Who skips the carrots?
[9765.42s -> 9765.98s]  ...mushrooms...
[9765.98s -> 9766.70s]  ...and a pot pie?
[9766.70s -> 9767.34s]  You're out of your mind.
[9767.34s -> 9768.54s]  ...so easy.
[9768.54s -> 9769.26s]  That's the best part.
[9769.26s -> 9771.10s]  ...make pot pie chili smothered in milk...
[9771.10s -> 9771.42s]  Okay.
[9772.14s -> 9774.06s]  ...Greek spinach and pet pie
[9774.06s -> 9777.42s]  and my favorite pepperoni pizza pot pie.
[9777.42s -> 9780.30s]  My kids love making s'mores pies for dessert
[9780.30s -> 9782.22s]  or sweet fruit tarts for mom.
[9783.34s -> 9783.98s]  They always...
[9786.29s -> 9788.86s]  You gotta give them credit, right?
[9788.86s -> 9791.10s]  It can't just be a pot pie maker.
[9791.10s -> 9791.82s]  It has to be...
[9791.82s -> 9793.34s]  It has to make cakes.
[9794.85s -> 9797.09s]  It can't just be a thing that makes pot pies.
[9797.09s -> 9797.89s]  It has to...
[9797.89s -> 9800.32s]  Look, it can be a muffin maker, too.
[9800.32s -> 9800.80s]  It can be...
[9802.02s -> 9803.30s]  It can make a pizza.
[9803.30s -> 9805.23s]  Dude, it can make pizza.
[9805.23s -> 9806.83s]  No, it's a pot pie maker, man.
[9806.83s -> 9807.71s]  That's fine.
[9807.71s -> 9808.27s]  That's okay.
[9809.90s -> 9810.54s]  It doesn't have to be like...
[9810.54s -> 9811.50s]  Oh, no, no, look.
[9811.50s -> 9813.74s]  We can prove that it can make a bunch of other food.
[9813.74s -> 9815.25s]  It doesn't have to make a pizza.
[9815.25s -> 9815.57s]  It's just...
[9815.57s -> 9817.25s]  Best pot pie is oven safe and...
[9817.25s -> 9818.37s]  It can make pot pies
[9818.37s -> 9819.97s]  and like other pastry type things.
[9819.97s -> 9820.85s]  Doesn't have to be a pizza.
[9820.85s -> 9824.05s]  Please now get my meal size best pie set
[9824.05s -> 9825.81s]  complete with double baking tray,
[9825.81s -> 9827.49s]  top and bottom crust cutters,
[9827.49s -> 9828.93s]  and recipe guides for only $10.
[9828.93s -> 9830.45s]  I hope there's a phone segment again.
[9830.45s -> 9830.69s]  Please.
[9830.69s -> 9831.81s]  For dipping and processing.
[9831.81s -> 9833.65s]  And to make sure everyone in your family
[9833.65s -> 9835.49s]  enjoys their own favorite fillings,
[9835.49s -> 9837.73s]  you'll get an additional double baking tray
[9837.73s -> 9839.33s]  and this great list of specials.
[9839.33s -> 9840.13s]  Come on.
[9840.13s -> 9841.73s]  Just pay separate processing.
[9841.73s -> 9844.85s]  That's a $40 value for one special low price.
[9844.85s -> 9846.53s]  And ask about my pop-up tray.
[9846.53s -> 9848.93s]  It makes getting your pot pies out a snap.
[9848.93s -> 9852.53s]  Call or go online to get your best pot pie right now.
[9853.49s -> 9855.09s]  No, it was just a weird segment.
[9855.09s -> 9857.65s]  There's nothing better to make with holiday leftovers
[9857.65s -> 9860.75s]  than my best watch.
[9860.75s -> 9862.21s]  I don't get it.
[9863.33s -> 9863.73s]  Get it.
[9864.85s -> 9867.79s]  Nothing better to make with holiday leftovers.
[9867.79s -> 9868.91s]  This is so interesting.
[9868.91s -> 9870.11s]  This is so interesting.
[9872.16s -> 9872.88s]  I love it.
[9872.88s -> 9874.48s]  It's so just odd.
[9876.78s -> 9878.06s]  Magic steam wave.
[9878.06s -> 9879.82s]  I think we've seen plenty of these.
[9879.82s -> 9880.94s]  Okay, we'll go down to...
[9882.45s -> 9883.41s]  We'll go down to 50.
[9887.94s -> 9891.14s]  Microwave ovens are quick when you want to reheat.
[9891.14s -> 9893.22s]  But they can make your meal dry.
[9893.22s -> 9894.82s]  Especially meat.
[9894.82s -> 9896.74s]  And that chicken is like rubber.
[9896.74s -> 9897.22s]  And no...
[9897.22s -> 9898.18s]  I'm telling you.
[9898.18s -> 9899.62s]  It's fun to edit these.
[9899.62s -> 9900.98s]  It's time to get the magic steam wave.
[9900.98s -> 9903.54s]  The brand new way to use your microwave.
[9903.54s -> 9905.06s]  Wait, we gotta analyze this.
[9905.70s -> 9907.06s]  Look at what's going on here.
[9907.70s -> 9909.38s]  Especially meat.
[9909.38s -> 9909.86s]  And...
[9909.86s -> 9911.78s]  Look at this lady, right?
[9912.42s -> 9913.54s]  There everyone is like...
[9913.54s -> 9914.58s]  This lady is like...
[9914.58s -> 9916.18s]  That chicken is like...
[9916.18s -> 9917.22s]  She's like, oh my god.
[9917.22s -> 9918.90s]  She look at how embarrassed she is.
[9918.90s -> 9921.81s]  That all this food was put in the microwave.
[9921.81s -> 9922.29s]  All of it.
[9922.29s -> 9923.09s]  Everything here.
[9923.09s -> 9928.13s]  This is like one, two, three, four, five, probably six cutlets.
[9928.13s -> 9931.04s]  A whole side dish.
[9931.04s -> 9932.48s]  And this is just like a...
[9932.48s -> 9935.42s]  Ooh, sorry.
[9936.38s -> 9938.30s]  I put everything in the microwave.
[9938.30s -> 9938.78s]  Everything.
[9938.78s -> 9940.22s]  No one will eat.
[9940.22s -> 9940.62s]  Oops.
[9942.02s -> 9943.70s]  It's time to get the magic steam wave.
[9943.70s -> 9944.82s]  You wouldn't put all of them.
[9944.82s -> 9947.22s]  The brand new way to use your microwave.
[9947.78s -> 9950.50s]  Magic steam wave uses the power of steam
[9950.98s -> 9952.74s]  Another microwave steamer.
[9952.74s -> 9953.94s]  These were so popular.
[9953.94s -> 9956.74s]  Heating food evenly and locking in moisture.
[9956.74s -> 9959.94s]  Your food tastes like it's fresh from the oven.
[9959.94s -> 9963.22s]  Look, this day old bread is already hard as a rock.
[9963.94s -> 9966.26s]  But 30 seconds in the magic steam wave...
[9966.26s -> 9967.14s]  Day old bread?
[9967.94s -> 9971.78s]  I've eaten like week or two old bread and it wasn't like that.
[9971.78s -> 9972.28s]  Huh?
[9972.98s -> 9975.70s]  Simply add a little water to the steam capsule.
[9975.70s -> 9977.38s]  Day old bread.
[9977.38s -> 9981.62s]  The new patent pending technology quickly creates and circulates steam.
[9981.62s -> 9985.54s]  Making your microwave work like an expensive convection oven.
[9986.18s -> 9990.82s]  You get moist, delicious gourmet meals in a microwave minute.
[9990.82s -> 9992.18s]  Perfect every time.
[9992.18s -> 9994.02s]  No sticky plastic wrap.
[9994.02s -> 9996.02s]  No wet paper towels.
[9996.02s -> 10000.58s]  With magic steam wave, you can steam all your fresh foods fast.
[10000.58s -> 10002.02s]  Everything cooks evenly.
[10002.02s -> 10003.22s]  The paper towel works just fine.
[10003.22s -> 10004.50s]  No spots for uncooked areas.
[10004.50s -> 10006.50s]  So call today and get the amazing...
[10006.50s -> 10008.10s]  PFOA free.
[10008.10s -> 10010.02s]  ...for just $10.
[10010.02s -> 10010.98s]  But wait.
[10010.98s -> 10014.26s]  Order now and get the magic steam wave caddy free.
[10014.26s -> 10016.02s]  Here's the thing that it comes in.
[10016.02s -> 10017.94s]  It holds all your plates or bowls...
[10017.94s -> 10019.06s]  Here's the thing that it comes in.
[10019.06s -> 10022.58s]  ...while allowing steam to circulate and cook your meal evenly.
[10022.58s -> 10025.70s]  And the handles are always cool to the touch.
[10025.70s -> 10027.06s]  Delicious.
[10027.06s -> 10028.02s]  Reheat.
[10028.02s -> 10028.74s]  Restore.
[10028.74s -> 10030.02s]  Okay, we don't need to say anymore.
[10031.74s -> 10033.10s]  The perfect bacon bowl.
[10033.90s -> 10035.10s]  This is a classic.
[10035.10s -> 10036.14s]  I think everybody's seen this.
[10037.50s -> 10038.54s]  Everybody's seen this, right?
[10039.86s -> 10041.54s]  This is the perfect bacon bowl.
[10041.54s -> 10042.98s]  I've seen it.
[10042.98s -> 10043.38s]  You have.
[10043.38s -> 10045.06s]  Everybody loves bacon.
[10045.06s -> 10046.02s]  The sizzle.
[10046.02s -> 10046.82s]  The scent.
[10046.82s -> 10048.42s]  The mouth-watering taste.
[10048.42s -> 10050.10s]  Didn't think it could get any better?
[10050.10s -> 10050.66s]  Watch.
[10050.66s -> 10052.58s]  We're turning bacon upside down.
[10052.58s -> 10053.14s]  It's a muffin tray.
[10053.14s -> 10055.06s]  Introducing bacon bowl.
[10055.06s -> 10056.82s]  The easy way to make delicious edible bowls...
[10056.82s -> 10057.78s]  It's an upside down muffin tray.
[10057.78s -> 10060.98s]  ...have bacon for fun, savory, crunchable yum.
[10060.98s -> 10064.66s]  Just wrap your favorite cut of bacon around the bacon bowl form and cook.
[10064.66s -> 10065.62s]  And put it into the oven.
[10065.62s -> 10068.26s]  In just minutes, you'll have tasty, toasty bacon.
[10068.58s -> 10069.38s]  The big crunch.
[10069.38s -> 10071.06s]  ...and hash browns for breakfast.
[10071.06s -> 10073.06s]  It's better in a bacon bowl.
[10073.06s -> 10074.74s]  BLT for lunch.
[10074.74s -> 10077.30s]  Bacon bowl makes a whole new way to munch.
[10077.30s -> 10079.14s]  The patented design allows the bacon...
[10079.14s -> 10079.70s]  I'd eat that.
[10080.96s -> 10081.92s]  Talk all the shit you want.
[10081.92s -> 10083.20s]  Everybody talk a bunch of shit.
[10083.20s -> 10086.27s]  You gotta talk a bunch of shit.
[10086.27s -> 10090.19s]  If you drizzled like mayo, mayo, mayo, mayo.
[10090.19s -> 10092.22s]  I'd eat this.
[10092.22s -> 10092.62s]  This would...
[10092.62s -> 10094.06s]  I would probably enjoy that.
[10094.06s -> 10098.69s]  That actually...
[10098.69s -> 10102.18s]  As long as the bacon was like cooked and it was actually crispy and good.
[10102.18s -> 10105.30s]  It'd be like drizzle, drizzle, drizzle, drizzle, drizzle.
[10105.94s -> 10106.82s]  Just a little bit of mayo.
[10106.82s -> 10108.10s]  Just a small line of mayo.
[10108.66s -> 10110.02s]  And I would eat it.
[10110.66s -> 10113.22s]  I wouldn't be excited.
[10113.22s -> 10114.26s]  But I would be like, that's good.
[10114.26s -> 10116.26s]  ...while Grease collects in the channel.
[10116.26s -> 10118.50s]  So you can pour it out of your diet.
[10118.50s -> 10124.42s]  Go from unsatisfying bacon bit snacks to hot crispy bacon bowl stuff to the max.
[10124.42s -> 10126.10s]  Or make healthy egg white turkey bacon bowls.
[10126.10s -> 10127.46s]  He's a mayo addict.
[10127.46s -> 10128.26s]  I'm not a mayo.
[10128.26s -> 10129.06s]  Mayo is good.
[10129.06s -> 10129.30s]  Stop.
[10129.30s -> 10130.58s]  I'm itching my nose so much.
[10130.58s -> 10135.46s]  ...bacon bowl cooks bacon to perfection in the oven, microwave, and toaster oven too.
[10135.46s -> 10136.90s]  Feel like mac and cheese?
[10136.90s -> 10137.46s]  Serve up the...
[10138.18s -> 10139.82s]  We're moving on.
[10141.02s -> 10141.34s]  All right.
[10141.34s -> 10143.02s]  We got the easy meatball.
[10146.22s -> 10147.10s]  Easy meatball.
[10147.10s -> 10148.06s]  I feel like it's gonna be...
[10148.06s -> 10149.34s]  We've already seen one of these.
[10156.42s -> 10158.58s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10158.58s -> 10160.98s]  This is the guy that typically does all the voiceovers.
[10160.98s -> 10163.54s]  But he's like talking like he's from New York.
[10176.37s -> 10177.01s]  Is this the same guy?
[10181.81s -> 10183.65s]  Wait, what is this thing?
[10186.50s -> 10186.74s]  What?
[10193.02s -> 10193.98s]  That's not gonna...
[10193.98s -> 10194.78s]  That doesn't happen.
[10195.34s -> 10195.58s]  Right?
[10197.18s -> 10203.33s]  Will this actually do this?
[10204.05s -> 10206.26s]  I feel like it would just not...
[10206.26s -> 10207.06s]  It would just move around.
[10215.23s -> 10216.51s]  Meatball hot dog?
[10216.51s -> 10217.63s]  Oh no, that was a meatball sub.
[10224.54s -> 10225.28s]  Okay.
[10226.00s -> 10229.97s]  I can't see shit with only six pixels.
[10229.97s -> 10231.25s]  Yeah, I couldn't really see that one.
[10232.66s -> 10233.30s]  Onion Bloom.
[10233.30s -> 10235.14s]  I think we already know what this one's gonna be.
[10235.14s -> 10238.05s]  These were so popular because of Outback.
[10243.09s -> 10244.05s]  You just don't.
[10244.05s -> 10244.45s]  You just don't.
[10252.85s -> 10254.69s]  Well, this one's a lot more work than some of the other ones.
[10257.81s -> 10259.17s]  Some of the other ones are just...
[10259.17s -> 10260.05s]  You crush it with the thing.
[10260.05s -> 10267.41s]  I think there are versions of this that are better.
[10277.97s -> 10279.01s]  All right, but that's not the hard part.
[10281.41s -> 10283.09s]  I feel like this is the easy part.
[10283.09s -> 10286.05s]  And deep frying the fucking thing is the annoying hard part.
[10291.01s -> 10292.05s]  Like, this is the part that sucks.
[10292.05s -> 10293.09s]  Like, the part...
[10293.09s -> 10294.21s]  Dumping it in the oil sucks.
[10294.21s -> 10294.77s]  And it's annoying.
[10294.77s -> 10295.41s]  It takes a lot of work.
[10304.85s -> 10306.61s]  Oh, I thought the onion was dishwasher.
[10306.61s -> 10308.61s]  I was like, why would you put an onion in the dishwasher, dude?
[10312.45s -> 10312.77s]  Okay.
[10315.14s -> 10315.46s]  All right.
[10316.50s -> 10318.10s]  We don't need to see muffin top magic.
[10318.10s -> 10322.37s]  We already know what this is.
[10322.37s -> 10323.97s]  It's gonna be another one of those cupcakes.
[10323.97s -> 10327.01s]  It's like, look, you can put filling in a cupcake.
[10327.73s -> 10329.17s]  You can put filling in a cupcake.
[10329.17s -> 10329.81s]  I'll just prove it to you.
[10336.35s -> 10336.67s]  What?
[10340.91s -> 10341.79s]  Who's doing this?
[10346.21s -> 10348.77s]  You throw the whole bottom away.
[10349.41s -> 10352.37s]  Have you tried those so-called muffin top fans
[10352.37s -> 10354.29s]  only to bake an inedible waste?
[10354.29s -> 10356.61s]  Then you're gonna love muffin top magic.
[10356.61s -> 10357.33s]  The best...
[10357.33s -> 10358.37s]  Shit-faced, yeah.
[10358.37s -> 10360.21s]  ...to make the best part of any muffin...
[10360.21s -> 10360.77s]  I'm interested.
[10360.77s -> 10362.85s]  ...and other sweet and savory tasty treats.
[10362.85s -> 10363.81s]  It's so easy.
[10363.81s -> 10364.37s]  Just add a...
[10364.37s -> 10365.49s]  There's always an egg sandwich.
[10365.49s -> 10366.21s]  ...to each cup.
[10366.21s -> 10367.57s]  Place the patented muffin top...
[10367.57s -> 10369.57s]  Always an egg fucking sandwich.
[10369.57s -> 10372.05s]  Egg sandwich, egg sandwich, egg sandwich.
[10372.05s -> 10373.73s]  Every one of these makes egg sandwiches.
[10373.73s -> 10375.17s]  ...muffin tops rise higher.
[10375.17s -> 10376.21s]  See the difference?
[10376.21s -> 10380.37s]  The result is super moist and flavorful muffin tops every time.
[10380.37s -> 10383.89s]  This fucking phone number is fake.
[10386.16s -> 10387.92s]  This number is not real.
[10389.97s -> 10393.01s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[10394.77s -> 10397.89s]  Maybe, oh, it might have been because the number didn't exist anymore.
[10397.89s -> 10398.39s]  They...
[10399.65s -> 10402.05s]  Maybe for like re-uploading it to like YouTube or something
[10402.05s -> 10403.89s]  because it probably doesn't exist anymore.
[10403.89s -> 10405.01s]  They just made it a fake number.
[10405.49s -> 10406.13s]  That would make sense.
[10406.13s -> 10409.41s]  ...while the muffin top rises to a glorious crunchy golden brown.
[10409.41s -> 10411.49s]  And muffin tops are only the beginning.
[10411.49s -> 10413.17s]  Make perfect poached eggs.
[10413.17s -> 10414.93s]  Cheddar garlic biscuits for dinner.
[10414.93s -> 10416.93s]  Healthy after-school pizza snacks.
[10416.93s -> 10420.29s]  And these incredible cupcake tops will make you a winner.
[10420.29s -> 10422.77s]  Even delicious stuffed chocolate crescent rolls
[10422.77s -> 10425.01s]  or sliders that will warm your soul.
[10425.01s -> 10426.21s]  You need to use all these?
[10427.65s -> 10429.01s]  That's a whole other ordeal.
[10429.01s -> 10429.51s]  Maybe.
[10431.65s -> 10432.37s]  And we're gonna get two.
[10432.37s -> 10433.65s]  ...and get one free.
[10433.97s -> 10434.61s]  Five, five, five.
[10434.61s -> 10435.97s]  Five, five, five, five, five.
[10435.97s -> 10437.65s]  ...to lift and serve your...
[10437.65s -> 10439.17s]  Ooh, you get a spatula too.
[10439.17s -> 10440.37s]  ...and we're still not done.
[10440.37s -> 10443.25s]  The first 500 callers get the better buddy too.
[10443.25s -> 10444.37s]  It dispenses the...
[10444.37s -> 10445.49s]  Also, how does that work?
[10447.55s -> 10450.77s]  What's the idea behind that?
[10450.77s -> 10454.29s]  If you call within the next 30 minutes, then you'll get this.
[10456.61s -> 10457.89s]  Does that mean that like...
[10457.89s -> 10460.29s]  Okay, so if the first 500 callers...
[10460.29s -> 10465.25s]  What if your caller number 502, 503, 501, 504?
[10466.43s -> 10467.31s]  What happens?
[10470.22s -> 10471.98s]  Can they say that?
[10471.98s -> 10475.70s]  Because like the first 500 callers,
[10475.70s -> 10479.62s]  at the start of the airing of this commercial, right?
[10479.62s -> 10481.78s]  Or like, oh, if you call in the next 30 minutes,
[10481.78s -> 10484.66s]  the commercial is constantly airing somewhere, right?
[10484.66s -> 10487.49s]  So if you have syndicated commercial
[10487.49s -> 10489.41s]  that will play in every time zone,
[10489.41s -> 10491.50s]  30 to 40 minutes away from each other,
[10491.50s -> 10493.34s]  it'll always be 30 minutes, right?
[10493.34s -> 10494.06s]  Always.
[10494.06s -> 10498.06s]  How does that specific...
[10498.06s -> 10499.74s]  How does that work specifically?
[10499.74s -> 10503.70s]  It's just a lie.
[10503.70s -> 10505.22s]  It builds FOMO.
[10505.22s -> 10506.99s]  I know it builds FOMO,
[10506.99s -> 10508.59s]  but if your caller number...
[10508.59s -> 10510.43s]  Okay, let's say that if you were...
[10510.99s -> 10514.67s]  Okay, let's say I got 500 people that all were like,
[10514.67s -> 10515.79s]  I want to buy this product.
[10515.79s -> 10518.75s]  They're like, okay, everyone call and buy the product.
[10519.39s -> 10522.19s]  And then the 500 first person calls
[10522.19s -> 10523.79s]  within the same like hour or two, right?
[10523.79s -> 10525.47s]  And like the 500 first person's like, I want to buy it.
[10525.47s -> 10525.71s]  Do they...
[10527.71s -> 10530.83s]  If I can prove that this is caller number 501,
[10530.83s -> 10532.21s]  what would happen?
[10534.10s -> 10535.30s]  Everybody gets it.
[10535.30s -> 10536.18s]  Everybody gets it back.
[10536.18s -> 10536.50s]  Yeah, I know.
[10536.50s -> 10537.94s]  But like, what if you proved it?
[10539.71s -> 10540.35s]  They don't care.
[10540.35s -> 10540.99s]  They're not counting.
[10547.15s -> 10548.35s]  You're just lying though.
[10548.35s -> 10550.91s]  How many people aren't actually gonna call?
[10553.55s -> 10558.27s]  You say that, but if you turn on like QVC or HSN
[10558.27s -> 10560.27s]  or like home shopping networks, right?
[10560.27s -> 10563.71s]  Like all those networks that existed.
[10563.71s -> 10564.51s]  They ran...
[10564.51s -> 10570.67s]  They would sell out during the presentation.
[10570.67s -> 10571.71s]  They would sell out.
[10571.71s -> 10574.03s]  They'd be like, okay, we only have the red ones left.
[10574.59s -> 10575.63s]  People do this.
[10575.63s -> 10576.27s]  People call.
[10576.27s -> 10578.66s]  People do.
[10578.66s -> 10580.02s]  Unless it's manufactured.
[10580.02s -> 10581.38s]  But people would go on...
[10581.38s -> 10583.94s]  I remember they're like, oh, we've got this vacuum on QVC.
[10583.94s -> 10585.22s]  And it'd be like in three colors.
[10585.22s -> 10588.02s]  And the person would be like, oh, I'm getting word.
[10588.02s -> 10589.86s]  We don't have any more blue vacuums left.
[10589.86s -> 10592.18s]  And they'd have like a little sold out thing on it.
[10592.18s -> 10598.61s]  Why would they say you can't buy it?
[10598.61s -> 10599.57s]  Old people buy that.
[10604.59s -> 10607.47s]  But why would they want to limit the amount of product they could sell?
[10607.47s -> 10613.14s]  All right, how's the mix and bake?
[10613.14s -> 10616.02s]  Do you love to bake a delicious homemade cake?
[10616.02s -> 10618.03s]  Mix the batter.
[10618.03s -> 10618.67s]  Let me guess.
[10618.67s -> 10620.99s]  It's going to be silicone and it's going to be...
[10620.99s -> 10621.55s]  There it is.
[10621.55s -> 10622.35s]  Mix and bake.
[10622.35s -> 10625.65s]  So let's you mix and bake a cake.
[10625.65s -> 10626.37s]  What the...
[10626.37s -> 10627.09s]  Whoa!
[10627.09s -> 10627.89s]  Actually, that was cool.
[10627.89s -> 10629.09s]  So there's no messy...
[10629.09s -> 10630.13s]  Whoa, dude.
[10630.13s -> 10634.77s]  Mix and bake is a full-size deep dish bowl.
[10634.77s -> 10636.21s]  But can it make an egg sandwich?
[10636.21s -> 10636.69s]  Put it down.
[10636.69s -> 10639.01s]  Place it in the oven and bake your cake.
[10639.01s -> 10642.00s]  The Dory baking...
[10642.00s -> 10644.24s]  I don't know if I want this unless it can make fucking poached eggs.
[10644.24s -> 10646.40s]  ...from the silicone and the cake.
[10646.40s -> 10647.52s]  No sticking.
[10647.52s -> 10648.24s]  The secret is...
[10648.24s -> 10648.72s]  That's cool.
[10648.80s -> 10652.40s]  ...jewel chamber design that lets you mix and bake in one pan.
[10652.40s -> 10653.52s]  This is a cool thing, I think.
[10653.52s -> 10654.56s]  ...for perfect cake every time.
[10654.56s -> 10657.33s]  There's never enough room for baking pans.
[10657.33s -> 10658.05s]  But mix and bake...
[10658.05s -> 10659.01s]  Do some organization.
[10659.01s -> 10663.10s]  ...for easy storage full of dishes.
[10663.10s -> 10664.70s]  But mix and bake is the perfect way...
[10664.70s -> 10666.14s]  Just take it all out and you can put it...
[10666.14s -> 10667.74s]  You could reorganize that in a minute.
[10667.74s -> 10668.30s]  ...to make this cake clean up.
[10668.30s -> 10669.26s]  Takes the cake.
[10669.26s -> 10670.78s]  Just mix, pop, and bake in one pan.
[10670.78s -> 10671.58s]  I like that, though.
[10671.58s -> 10672.38s]  That's pretty cool.
[10672.38s -> 10674.06s]  No mess, no stress.
[10674.06s -> 10676.14s]  Plus it's BPA-free and dishwasher-free.
[10676.14s -> 10677.02s]  BPA-free.
[10677.02s -> 10680.78s]  Grandkids love to bake a cake and enjoy the magic of mix and bake.
[10680.78s -> 10685.79s]  Grandma, just mix and bake a cake that company will love.
[10685.79s -> 10687.47s]  That cabinet is actually my house.
[10687.47s -> 10690.61s]  Pop, pop, pop of birthday delight, that first bite.
[10690.61s -> 10692.61s]  Now you can mix, pop, and bake...
[10692.61s -> 10698.77s]  These companies know a very, very important constant truth across all of us.
[10699.82s -> 10701.50s]  And that constant truth is always this.
[10702.66s -> 10707.34s]  You have in your place right now, in your home or your apartment,
[10707.34s -> 10713.10s]  you have probably three or four randomly fucking sized random-ass oven pans.
[10714.29s -> 10716.37s]  That you don't know why you still have.
[10717.63s -> 10719.79s]  You've had them for potentially fucking years.
[10720.43s -> 10720.83s]  They're like...
[10720.83s -> 10722.82s]  They look like shit.
[10722.82s -> 10726.48s]  They're kind of like discolored and like kind of weird looking.
[10726.48s -> 10728.72s]  And you have like four of them and they're just randomly sized
[10728.72s -> 10730.08s]  and you just won't get rid of them.
[10730.08s -> 10730.72s]  Ever.
[10730.72s -> 10731.78s]  And you just use them.
[10731.78s -> 10732.66s]  You just use them always.
[10733.38s -> 10735.70s]  So they know that everybody has that.
[10735.70s -> 10738.82s]  So they just tap into that by going,
[10738.82s -> 10739.46s]  Look, you don't...
[10739.46s -> 10744.50s]  I know you have that cabinet full of those randomly like discolored random-sized pans.
[10744.50s -> 10746.90s]  So just get this and you'll be fine.
[10746.90s -> 10751.02s]  And then people like me or like you will do that.
[10751.02s -> 10754.05s]  Because like, yeah, fuck man.
[10754.05s -> 10761.01s]  I guess I do have like a baking tray that I've had since like 2003.
[10765.34s -> 10766.06s]  And it's...
[10766.06s -> 10767.42s]  You don't even know why you still have it.
[10767.42s -> 10768.54s]  Why won't you just replace it?
[10769.74s -> 10770.46s]  Replace it.
[10770.46s -> 10770.96s]  Why?
[10773.07s -> 10773.95s]  I won't do it.
[10773.95s -> 10775.31s]  I should.
[10775.31s -> 10776.35s]  But I'm not going to.
[10776.35s -> 10777.39s]  I don't know why.
[10777.39s -> 10778.53s]  All right, what about the brew stick?
[10780.10s -> 10782.18s]  We all need that morning cup of Joe.
[10782.18s -> 10784.34s]  But brewing a whole pot is a waste.
[10784.34s -> 10786.74s]  It's like pouring cash in the trash.
[10786.74s -> 10788.10s]  Introducing brew stick.
[10788.10s -> 10792.26s]  The amazing new way to make delicious single serve coffee in seconds.
[10792.26s -> 10792.90s]  Watch.
[10792.90s -> 10795.70s]  Just scoop the brew stick into your favorite brand of coffee.
[10795.70s -> 10798.42s]  Lock it closed and stir into a mug of hot water.
[10798.42s -> 10801.06s]  Just stir it longer if you want it stronger.
[10801.06s -> 10806.26s]  The secret is our exclusive micro mesh that infuses coffee into hot water for rich...
[10806.26s -> 10807.06s]  This is not...
[10807.06s -> 10808.02s]  This is not going to make coffee.
[10808.02s -> 10809.54s]  ...the perfect cup of coffee.
[10809.54s -> 10812.42s]  Stir mouth-watering French vanilla coffee at your desk.

[10821.94s -> 10823.14s]  Hold on, I'm biting my lip.
[10823.14s -> 10825.46s]  ...but without the expense or the waste.
[10825.46s -> 10826.66s]  Brew stick works with tea...
[10826.66s -> 10829.46s]  Doesn't coffee need to pressurize through beans?
[10829.46s -> 10831.70s]  Lock it closed, stir, and enjoy.
[10831.70s -> 10834.10s]  You can even make iced tea or iced coffee.
[10834.10s -> 10838.42s]  Here are some first-time reactions to our blind taste test against instant coffee.
[10838.42s -> 10841.30s]  This is definitely a much crisper, fresher taste.
[10841.30s -> 10842.58s]  This one's very good.
[10842.58s -> 10844.50s]  This you can tell is like instant.
[10844.50s -> 10847.78s]  Well, what they didn't tell him is we used toilet water for the left one.
[10848.90s -> 10850.42s]  Very rich and full-bodied.
[10850.42s -> 10852.18s]  Brew stick is dishwasher safe.

[10855.70s -> 10857.54s]  Single serve pods are expensive.
[10857.54s -> 10861.30s]  Store-bought coffee at $2 a day adds up to $700...
[10861.30s -> 10862.90s]  That wouldn't brew coffee though, would it?
[10862.90s -> 10866.74s]  ...fast, fresh, delicious single serve coffee with brew stick in red.
[10866.82s -> 10869.38s]  It would be kind of flavored water, wouldn't it?

[10887.94s -> 10889.89s]  I mean, I get the idea,
[10889.89s -> 10899.71s]  but I feel like it would take a lot longer than just simply going like this for one second.
[10899.71s -> 10901.15s]  All right, let's, let's...
[10901.15s -> 10903.07s]  Oh my god, time flies when you're having fun.
[10903.07s -> 10905.09s]  I've been doing this for three hours.
[10905.09s -> 10907.58s]  All right.
[10907.58s -> 10912.45s]  Wait, I got a lot of shit up here.
[10912.45s -> 10914.77s]  Let's go over here.
[10914.77s -> 10915.81s]  This is a different playlist.
[10915.81s -> 10919.42s]  This is like automotive products.
[10919.42s -> 10920.94s]  Oh my god, this is so bright.
[10920.94s -> 10922.54s]  Now I understand what you guys are talking about.
[10922.54s -> 10925.30s]  So what is this one?
[10926.18s -> 10927.57s]  Pretty good music.
[10930.13s -> 10930.63s]  What?
[10935.25s -> 10936.05s]  Holy shit.
[10939.33s -> 10940.85s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[10944.29s -> 10950.05s]  It's a second mirror?
[10953.89s -> 10954.37s]  Wait a minute.
[10963.57s -> 10964.13s]  Whoa.
[10964.13s -> 10964.85s]  Okay.
[10964.85s -> 10966.61s]  But how, what if it spalls off?
[10970.85s -> 10972.29s]  That looks like it's just kind of clipped on.
[10974.29s -> 10976.45s]  Revealing what's in your car's blind spots.
[10976.45s -> 10977.49s]  It couldn't be easier.
[10977.49s -> 10979.57s]  Clear zone mirror installs in seconds.
[10979.57s -> 10981.01s]  Adjust and you're ready to go.
[10981.01s -> 10981.73s]  Look again.
[10981.73s -> 10985.25s]  Clear zone instantly reveals the tractor trailer in your blood.
[10985.25s -> 10991.06s]  They've made it look like you're putting a webcam on top of your monitor.
[10991.06s -> 10994.42s]  If that's secure, then that, that's kind of helpful, isn't it?
[10994.42s -> 10997.70s]  You say clear zone makes parking in the tightest spots a breeze.
[10997.70s -> 11000.90s]  Back in with only inches to spare and let clear zone steer you clear.
[11000.90s -> 11001.40s]  No.
[11003.46s -> 11004.18s]  No, honey.
[11004.18s -> 11005.46s]  You can't pull.
[11005.46s -> 11006.90s]  That's too small of a space.
[11007.46s -> 11008.10s]  I got this.
[11008.10s -> 11008.74s]  What are you talking about?
[11008.74s -> 11010.54s]  I got the clear zone.
[11010.54s -> 11011.42s]  No, it's not big enough.
[11011.42s -> 11012.62s]  It's not, you know, you're going to hit something.
[11012.62s -> 11013.82s]  Please don't, just easy, easy.
[11013.82s -> 11014.06s]  You're going.
[11014.06s -> 11014.62s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[11014.62s -> 11015.18s]  Turn, turn the wheel.
[11015.18s -> 11015.74s]  Turn the wheel.
[11015.74s -> 11016.46s]  Turn the wheel.

[11032.29s -> 11036.37s]  If this is how much room I have to spare, how am I getting out of the car?

[11093.06s -> 11096.48s]  The stream machine.

[11354.78s -> 11355.50s]  Another one of these.
[11359.31s -> 11360.11s]  Whoa, look out.
[11362.59s -> 11364.35s]  Wait, what was in your rear view?
[11364.35s -> 11366.11s]  You still can't see everything.
[11366.11s -> 11367.79s]  Now you can practically say.
[11367.79s -> 11368.91s]  But wait a minute.
[11368.91s -> 11370.91s]  You check and check and you still.
[11371.79s -> 11373.31s]  What was going on with this lady's mirror?
[11374.27s -> 11376.11s]  I know what the fucking problem is, lady.
[11377.12s -> 11380.08s]  Your mirror is turned all the way in.
[11380.08s -> 11383.36s]  So you're only seeing your reflection driving the car.
[11383.36s -> 11388.62s]  You need to put the mirror out and fan it out, lady.
[11388.62s -> 11389.74s]  What are you doing?
[11389.74s -> 11391.10s]  Where did he come from?
[11391.10s -> 11394.14s]  You check and check and you still can't see everything.
[11394.14s -> 11398.06s]  Now you can practically say goodbye to blind spots with extra view.
[11398.06s -> 11403.42s]  This is a wide screen that gives you a true 180 degree view.
[11403.42s -> 11407.14s]  Look, ordinary really give you a field of view this wide.
[11407.14s -> 11410.98s]  But extra view expands your visibility to a full one.
[11410.98s -> 11412.18s]  How much does it take up though?
[11412.18s -> 11413.54s]  I feel like it'd be a lot of space.
[11413.54s -> 11417.30s]  Anti-glare chrome coated glass that lets you see up to three lanes wide.
[11417.30s -> 11419.62s]  So nothing will hide with extra view.
[11419.62s -> 11421.94s]  You're seeing when this get in the way.
[11421.94s -> 11423.94s]  Look at the difference of your actual vision.
[11423.94s -> 11427.54s]  Children, I am constantly adjusting my old mirror trying to get a view
[11427.54s -> 11429.70s]  of the entire car with extra view.
[11429.70s -> 11430.98s]  I don't have to touch anything.
[11430.98s -> 11434.18s]  I can see the entire vehicle from window to window, top to bottom.
[11434.18s -> 11436.82s]  With extra view, you can see the entire three lanes.
[11436.82s -> 11438.26s]  All three lanes?
[11438.26s -> 11440.98s]  Now turning around before, after.
[11440.98s -> 11442.74s]  The difference is crystal clear.
[11442.74s -> 11444.66s]  And extra view makes night driving easier.
[11444.66s -> 11445.54s]  How does it do that?
[11445.54s -> 11448.42s]  Watch high beams and those new LED headlights
[11448.42s -> 11450.34s]  can really hurt your eyes at night.
[11450.34s -> 11453.54s]  But extra view reduces glare by up to 50%.
[11453.54s -> 11456.02s]  Making night driving safer and more comfortable.
[11456.02s -> 11456.26s]  Okay.
[11456.26s -> 11459.54s]  Ordinary mirrors make you twist your neck to check and recheck.
[11459.62s -> 11461.46s]  But extra view lets you see it all.
[11461.46s -> 11463.14s]  What just snaps on?
[11463.14s -> 11464.50s]  It's so much more comfortable.
[11464.50s -> 11466.90s]  Extra view quickly attaches to a regular mirror.
[11466.90s -> 11469.22s]  Snapping on or off in seconds.
[11469.22s -> 11472.50s]  Now when you're merging, changing lanes and backing up.
[11472.50s -> 11475.06s]  Extra view makes it safer and easier to do.
[11475.06s -> 11478.10s]  Is this somebody said is this legal for being on for road use?
[11478.10s -> 11479.46s]  I mean, I think so.
[11480.26s -> 11481.54s]  Day and night.
[11481.54s -> 11483.94s]  Similar items sell in catalogs for up to $6.
[11483.94s -> 11485.46s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[11485.46s -> 11488.50s]  Why would it be illegal for just $14.95?
[11488.50s -> 11491.54s]  As a bonus, we'll send you a second extra view free.

[13342.10s -> 13344.10s]  Your light bulb burned out again
[13344.10s -> 13350.58s]  They don't even make those old light bulbs anymore and those odd shaped led bulbs shine a harsh light in just one
[13350.74s -> 13352.74s]  LEDs are amazing now aren't they?
[13352.74s -> 13358.50s]  Do you buy you need the new ultra bulb led from bell and howl it's the smarter light
[13359.21s -> 13362.33s]  Ultra bulb uses new led technology. So it's an led
[13363.37s -> 13368.09s]  Okay, so it's an led old bulbs did look compact fluorescent bulbs are dim
[13368.71s -> 13374.09s]  Incandescent bulbs always die and most led bulbs shine light in just one direction
[13374.49s -> 13380.41s]  But the new ultra bulb shines a warm bright light evenly and how many okay your original bulb?
[13380.65s -> 13386.81s]  Just look at the difference. That's so bright though. I don't want that bright new 360 degree reflector wrapped with 28 super bright
[13387.37s -> 13388.57s]  technology
[13388.57s -> 13395.21s]  In every direction that would be too bright can last over 10 years without burning out same leds do to reach light bulbs
[13395.29s -> 13400.81s]  It's an led one ultra bulb can replace 25 ordinary bulbs, but not leds because it's an led

[13404.57s -> 13407.66s]  Ultra bulb is always cool to the touch
[13407.90s -> 13411.74s]  It uses eighty five percent less energy than your old light bulb
[13411.98s -> 13418.22s]  Just one ultra bulb can save you a hundred dollars over the life of the bulb and ultra bulb turns on instantly
[13418.46s -> 13422.06s]  No waiting to warm up like those other bulbs. So why is this like a
[13422.62s -> 13426.94s]  Like the freezer room from like a ninety seven eleven. What are you talking about?
[13427.42s -> 13432.38s]  What are they talking about ultra bulb turns on instantly? No waiting to warm up like those other bulbs

[13473.38s -> 13478.02s]  It takes almost no imagination at all. But when you have an open wall, what else can you do?
[13478.42s -> 13480.66s]  How about trying something completely new?
[13481.14s -> 13488.50s]  It's the living bubble the clear acrylic semi-spare globe that decorates any wall and provides a living space for your child to have their
