[4.02s -> 6.33s]  Alright, I'm back. Sorry about that.
[6.33s -> 12.02s]  Make a new green tea.
[12.02s -> 17.77s]  But I'm here now.
[17.77s -> 20.93s]  How you guys doin'?
[20.93s -> 22.93s]  Alright, so how this is gonna work...
[22.93s -> 32.00s]  Couple things here. Cut the music off.
[32.00s -> 35.88s]  Um, should I do like a OST in the background?
[35.88s -> 37.31s]  What do you guys think?
[37.31s -> 38.31s]  Because here's how this is gonna work.
[38.31s -> 41.38s]  I had this tier list that I found
[41.38s -> 43.56s]  has every single boss
[43.56s -> 45.74s]  across the entire franchise. All franchises.
[45.74s -> 48.68s]  Uh, so I need to...
[48.68s -> 50.68s]  Obviously it's been a while since I've played any of these games.
[50.68s -> 53.05s]  I remember all these fights.
[53.05s -> 56.48s]  But I have a bunch of videos over here
[56.48s -> 61.56s]  of all just the boss fights.
[61.56s -> 63.86s]  So I can just kind of scrub through and be like
[63.86s -> 65.86s]  Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that person.
[65.86s -> 66.86s]  Okay, sure.
[66.86s -> 70.58s]  So I just need a refresher sometimes.
[70.58s -> 74.46s]  All the Dark Souls 2 stuff, you guys did not see me play.
[74.46s -> 75.46s]  I did that off stream.
[75.46s -> 81.47s]  So, without further ado,
[81.47s -> 85.17s]  let's get an OST on. What do you guys think?
[85.17s -> 89.84s]  Any, uh, anything reaching out to you?
[89.84s -> 90.84s]  Anything doing it for you?
[90.84s -> 95.10s]  I could put on the Bloodborne OST. That seems fitting.
[95.10s -> 99.54s]  We'll switch it up in a minute.
[99.54s -> 106.22s]  Okay.
[106.22s -> 109.45s]  I don't want it to be too loud.
[109.45s -> 117.26s]  Okay, so that can just stay on.
[117.26s -> 122.38s]  This is the Bloodborne OST.
[122.38s -> 126.73s]  Without further ado, here we go.
[126.73s -> 132.34s]  So, take a look.
[132.34s -> 133.52s]  Here's what I got for you.
[133.52s -> 136.55s]  I've got...
[136.55s -> 142.16s]  Uh, let me just make sure I got it correctly.
[142.16s -> 143.16s]  Do.
[143.16s -> 148.52s]  And this correctly as well.
[148.52s -> 150.95s]  Which I do.
[150.95s -> 151.95s]  Okay.
[151.95s -> 152.95s]  So, here we go.
[152.95s -> 155.58s]  There's a lot here.
[155.58s -> 157.52s]  I can grow a little bit.
[157.52s -> 161.62s]  Maybe in the bottom?
[161.62s -> 164.11s]  There are a shitload of names.
[164.11s -> 171.11s]  This is gonna be...
[171.11s -> 173.11s]  This is gonna be difficult.
[173.11s -> 175.11s]  We are going to start with Demon's Souls.
[175.11s -> 176.80s]  He's growing.
[176.80s -> 181.94s]  Is that better?
[181.94s -> 184.31s]  A little bit of white on either side or no?
[184.31s -> 187.58s]  That's good right there.
[187.58s -> 194.38s]  Okay.
[194.38s -> 197.29s]  Okay.
[197.29s -> 198.29s]  So, we're gonna start with Demon's Souls.
[198.29s -> 202.49s]  I need a refresher because I have no fucking idea.
[202.49s -> 203.49s]  The refresher is, by the way,
[203.49s -> 205.49s]  I have all the Demon's Souls fights right here.
[205.49s -> 208.07s]  So, let's get started.
[208.07s -> 210.07s]  Let me do the ones that I know for certain absolutely.
[210.07s -> 213.07s]  These are how I feel the best from software bosses.
[213.07s -> 215.07s]  The criteria.
[215.07s -> 219.26s]  Game mechanic-wise.
[219.26s -> 220.50s]  How cool they looked.
[220.50s -> 221.50s]  How...
[221.50s -> 224.12s]  Like, their animation style.
[224.12s -> 225.49s]  The damage they did.
[225.49s -> 226.49s]  How angry I got, right?
[226.49s -> 230.49s]  Like, what was the most universal best fight I've done in any of these games?
[230.49s -> 233.49s]  I can already tell you what the first one is.
[233.49s -> 240.31s]  Ludwig from Bloodborne is by far...
[240.31s -> 241.31s]  I'm not gonna say it yet,
[241.31s -> 243.31s]  but I think it's the best fight they've ever done.
[243.31s -> 245.96s]  Where's the soundtrack?
[245.96s -> 249.95s]  All right.
[249.95s -> 250.95s]  So, we're gonna go down to Bloodborne.
[250.95s -> 251.95s]  Here we are.
[251.95s -> 252.95s]  This is gonna be so hard.
[252.95s -> 254.19s]  This is gonna be way harder than I think.
[254.19s -> 255.19s]  Okay.
[255.19s -> 257.78s]  Okay.
[257.78s -> 259.53s]  Where is...
[259.53s -> 260.53s]  There is...
[260.53s -> 261.53s]  Okay.
[261.53s -> 264.41s]  I gotta move you all the way up here.
[264.41s -> 265.41s]  Those of you that don't know this fight,
[265.41s -> 269.10s]  it's the best fight From Software's ever done.
[269.10s -> 272.10s]  The second phase of this fight had an amazing reveal.
[272.10s -> 276.15s]  I don't want...
[276.15s -> 278.15s]  I don't necessarily need to spoil too much.
[278.15s -> 281.16s]  The music is incredible.
[281.16s -> 282.16s]  It's...
[282.16s -> 283.16s]  It's a full package.
[283.16s -> 285.53s]  The boss fight is not too frustrating.
[285.53s -> 288.98s]  The first phase kind of is.
[288.98s -> 289.98s]  So, we know that's there.
[289.98s -> 291.67s]  100%.
[291.67s -> 294.62s]  The other one that's going up in S...
[294.62s -> 296.62s]  Let me see if I can remember if I can find it.
[296.62s -> 298.86s]  It's from Dark Souls 3.
[298.86s -> 299.86s]  DLC.
[299.86s -> 302.10s]  Slave Knight Gale.
[302.10s -> 304.36s]  Absolutely one of the...
[304.36s -> 306.36s]  Probably the second...
[306.36s -> 308.36s]  It's probably the second best fight they've ever done.
[308.36s -> 311.84s]  Right here.
[311.84s -> 317.43s]  I think...
[317.43s -> 319.74s]  Let's just get the S's done first.
[319.74s -> 323.06s]  I mean, I'm gonna put...
[323.06s -> 324.06s]  Let's get Gwyn up here immediately, right?
[324.06s -> 325.06s]  Like, I...
[325.06s -> 326.06s]  Come on, Gwyn.
[326.06s -> 327.06s]  Like, that was...
[327.06s -> 329.06s]  I don't know if that...
[329.06s -> 331.06s]  I think Gwyn is probably a B.
[331.06s -> 335.31s]  I think it's only...
[335.31s -> 337.31s]  It would be a C if it wasn't for the...
[337.31s -> 338.31s]  Come on, Gwyn.
[338.31s -> 341.41s]  Alright, now...
[341.41s -> 342.41s]  What are the S's?
[342.41s -> 343.41s]  Guaranteed S's.
[343.41s -> 344.84s]  Where's Horolue?
[344.84s -> 348.17s]  Horolue from Elden Ring?
[348.17s -> 351.30s]  I gotta say, it's probably...
[351.30s -> 352.30s]  Top...
[352.30s -> 354.61s]  It's gotta be at least A or S.
[354.61s -> 358.96s]  That whole fight was amazing.
[358.96s -> 359.96s]  I've never felt so...
[359.96s -> 361.20s]  Involved.
[361.20s -> 362.20s]  And my heart was just...
[362.20s -> 363.20s]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[363.20s -> 364.20s]  I was not annoyed.
[364.20s -> 365.20s]  I was not mad.
[365.20s -> 366.89s]  I was just truly...
[366.89s -> 367.89s]  In the zone.
[367.89s -> 368.89s]  It was really, really fun.
[368.89s -> 370.89s]  Alright, where is Horolue?
[370.89s -> 375.01s]  Uh...
[375.01s -> 377.01s]  It's gotta be pretty far down here, right?
[377.01s -> 378.76s]  Oh, yeah.
[378.76s -> 379.76s]  This part.
[379.76s -> 380.76s]  Let's turn it up.
[380.76s -> 385.90s]  Horolue.
[385.90s -> 389.14s]  Oh, I can also make sure I do the ones that are literally zero.
[389.14s -> 391.14s]  That are like the worst I've ever done.
[391.14s -> 395.82s]  Let's do the top ones first.
[395.82s -> 400.19s]  Where are you?
[400.19s -> 401.19s]  There's so many names.
[401.19s -> 404.16s]  There you go.
[404.16s -> 407.19s]  Alright.
[407.19s -> 408.19s]  Horolue slash Godfrey.
[408.19s -> 410.19s]  It is technically the same fight.
[410.19s -> 412.43s]  That's going up to S.
[412.43s -> 415.57s]  Who else belongs at S?
[415.57s -> 419.32s]  I don't know if any of the Dark Souls 2 bosses are gonna be even A.
[419.32s -> 425.64s]  I don't think so.
[425.64s -> 426.64s]  I'm trying to remember.
[426.64s -> 433.10s]  You know who else I need to put pretty high?
[433.10s -> 436.01s]  Where is it?
[436.01s -> 439.81s]  Bloodborne.
[439.81s -> 441.81s]  Why is Brainsucker a boss?
[441.81s -> 442.81s]  Brainsucker wasn't a boss?
[442.81s -> 449.36s]  Um...
[449.36s -> 455.49s]  I knew this was gonna be hard.
[455.49s -> 456.49s]  Ibritas.
[456.49s -> 457.49s]  Ibritas was...
[457.49s -> 459.05s]  I don't think it's S.
[459.05s -> 461.05s]  But I'm gonna say B.
[461.05s -> 462.61s]  Ibritas is really cool.
[462.61s -> 464.61s]  That was just one of those reveal fights.
[464.61s -> 466.85s]  Where you walk in the door.
[466.85s -> 467.85s]  And it's just like...
[467.85s -> 469.85s]  It's so scary that this thing is even down here.
[469.85s -> 471.54s]  The fight was...
[471.54s -> 472.54s]  Eh.
[472.54s -> 477.02s]  But I think the reveal was pretty cool.
[477.02s -> 478.02s]  Uh, where is...
[478.02s -> 482.18s]  All the Sekiro bosses.
[482.18s -> 484.18s]  Oh, fuck all the Sekiro bosses.
[484.18s -> 487.34s]  Yeah.
[487.34s -> 489.34s]  I think all the Sekiro bosses are gonna be C or lower.
[489.34s -> 495.12s]  Although, probably not.
[495.12s -> 496.12s]  We have to take a look.
[496.12s -> 497.30s]  I might need a refresher.
[497.30s -> 500.62s]  We should probably go one game at a time.
[500.62s -> 502.62s]  Alright, let's get a refresher here.
[502.62s -> 503.62s]  So this is Old Monk.
[503.62s -> 505.62s]  I forget what Old Monk was.
[505.62s -> 508.14s]  Old Monk.
[508.14s -> 511.69s]  Power Knight.
[511.69s -> 513.18s]  Flame Lurker?
[513.18s -> 514.74s]  No.
[514.74s -> 515.74s]  Is Old Monk even on here?
[515.74s -> 516.74s]  Was Old Monk even a boss fight?
[516.74s -> 517.98s]  Old Monk.
[517.98s -> 520.18s]  What do you got?
[520.18s -> 521.18s]  What happened here?
[521.18s -> 528.44s]  I forget this fight.
[528.44s -> 529.74s]  Old Monk is the invader.
[529.74s -> 531.74s]  Oh, right, right, right.
[531.74s -> 534.39s]  I need a refresher though.
[534.39s -> 535.39s]  I mean, what the fuck?
[535.39s -> 538.87s]  Let's go.
[538.87s -> 542.10s]  Hello?
[542.10s -> 543.10s]  Oh, there we go.
[543.10s -> 545.36s]  Okay.
[545.36s -> 548.14s]  So what happens here?
[548.14s -> 549.14s]  It's the guy that invades you.
[549.14s -> 552.02s]  Oh, with all the chairs.
[552.02s -> 553.02s]  I forgot about...
[553.02s -> 554.02s]  Yeah, this wasn't that bad.
[554.02s -> 558.43s]  Oh, yeah, he had the funny hat on.
[558.43s -> 559.86s]  Okay.
[559.86s -> 561.86s]  Wasn't he really, really easy?
[561.86s -> 564.26s]  Okay, this guy was stupid.
[564.26s -> 567.52s]  Yeah, this guy was pretty stupid.
[567.52s -> 569.89s]  Um, he did have the funny hat on though.
[569.89s -> 575.95s]  Comedy hat puts you in C.
[575.95s -> 577.95s]  Where is the spider?
[577.95s -> 581.05s]  Armor spider.
[581.05s -> 582.86s]  C.
[582.86s -> 585.62s]  Alright, I'll give you one refresher on the armor spider.
[585.62s -> 586.62s]  Here you go.
[586.62s -> 590.01s]  This is the one where you had to go down the hallway.
[590.01s -> 591.01s]  This...
[591.01s -> 592.01s]  Oh, I hated this.
[592.01s -> 595.74s]  This was stupid.
[595.74s -> 597.43s]  Yeah.
[597.43s -> 599.82s]  It starts back here.
[599.82s -> 600.82s]  Yeah, this boss was...
[600.82s -> 601.82s]  Oh, this was awful.
[601.82s -> 606.39s]  Yeah, this is going way lower.
[606.39s -> 607.39s]  Yeah.
[607.39s -> 608.39s]  No, fuck this boss.
[608.39s -> 609.95s]  Oh, shit.
[609.95s -> 610.95s]  Here comes Gascoigne.
[610.95s -> 613.95s]  Might as well put Gascoigne now because his music is playing.
[613.95s -> 617.37s]  But let's...
[617.37s -> 618.37s]  Oh, yeah.
[618.37s -> 619.37s]  Armor is D.
[619.37s -> 621.18s]  That fight was awful.
[621.18s -> 622.18s]  Okay.
[622.18s -> 624.18s]  Let's get Gascoigne up there because he was probably A.
[624.18s -> 628.09s]  It's going to be very blood-borne.
[628.09s -> 630.33s]  It's going to be blood-borne heavy at the top.
[630.33s -> 632.98s]  Where's Gascoigne?
[632.98s -> 637.10s]  Cleric beast.
[637.10s -> 638.10s]  I got to put...
[638.10s -> 639.10s]  Okay.
[639.10s -> 642.10s]  One of the only times you're going to see a blood-borne boss be like somewhere near F
[642.10s -> 643.10s]  is cleric beast.
[643.10s -> 645.66s]  This boss was just stupid.
[645.66s -> 646.66s]  There's like a...
[646.66s -> 647.66s]  You fight it on the bridge.
[647.66s -> 648.66s]  It takes up the whole bridge.
[648.66s -> 649.66s]  It's annoying.
[649.66s -> 651.15s]  This boss sucked.
[651.15s -> 652.15s]  Cleric beast was awful.
[652.15s -> 655.70s]  It just...
[655.70s -> 663.58s]  I don't like you fighting the things on like the tiny little bridges where they take up
[663.58s -> 664.58s]  the whole thing.
[664.58s -> 670.69s]  Although these have...
[670.69s -> 673.69s]  These might change, but where's Gascoigne?
[673.69s -> 677.74s]  Oh, the Gascoigne.
[677.74s -> 678.74s]  Alright.
[678.74s -> 679.74s]  This fight was awesome.
[679.74s -> 680.74s]  Let's change into...
[680.74s -> 681.74s]  Well, it's good.
[681.74s -> 684.97s]  Let's put it at A.
[684.97s -> 685.97s]  Put Pinwheel at S.
[685.97s -> 686.97s]  Pinwheel is...
[686.97s -> 687.97s]  Let's do that now.
[687.97s -> 688.97s]  F.
[688.97s -> 693.02s]  Hold on.
[693.02s -> 694.02s]  Stick with Demon's Souls for now.
[694.02s -> 695.90s]  The Adjuncticator.
[695.90s -> 696.90s]  What's the Adjuncticator?
[696.90s -> 697.90s]  Oh, Phalanx.
[697.90s -> 702.28s]  This is F, right?
[702.28s -> 703.28s]  Yeah.
[703.28s -> 704.28s]  This boss was stupid.
[704.28s -> 705.28s]  Yeah.
[705.28s -> 709.91s]  This thing was terrible.
[709.91s -> 716.46s]  Why is this lagging?
[716.46s -> 717.46s]  Why is it lagging?
[717.46s -> 722.48s]  Yeah.
[722.48s -> 726.42s]  That's going to go probably F or lower.
[726.42s -> 731.12s]  Because the fight was just...
[731.12s -> 734.12s]  It's a huge blob and the spears just stick out.
[734.12s -> 735.12s]  You're not even fighting a boss.
[735.12s -> 737.12s]  You're just fighting a big annoying thorn bush.
[737.12s -> 738.12s]  It's stupid.
[738.12s -> 739.42s]  That was Phalanx.
[739.42s -> 740.42s]  Okay.
[740.42s -> 749.64s]  Let me make sure this is right so far.
[749.64s -> 750.64s]  Yep.
[750.64s -> 753.16s]  Oh, Sif!
[753.16s -> 754.16s]  Wait.
[754.16s -> 755.16s]  Just stay in Demon's Souls.
[755.16s -> 756.16s]  I don't want to jump around.
[756.16s -> 758.16s]  Except for the ones that I know are going in F, which...
[758.16s -> 759.16s]  Where's Millenia?
[759.16s -> 762.94s]  Millenia is 100% F.
[762.94s -> 771.92s]  Wait.
[771.92s -> 772.92s]  Hold on.
[772.92s -> 773.92s]  Tibia Mariner.
[773.92s -> 774.92s]  We're going to get this one done right now, too.
[774.92s -> 779.63s]  The Tibia Mariner was like C, though, because it was funny.
[779.63s -> 784.84s]  Molting.
[784.84s -> 788.85s]  The Millenia fight was one of the worst things I've ever done in a Souls game.
[788.85s -> 792.28s]  And I know I said that for Isshin.
[792.28s -> 793.46s]  But nope.
[793.46s -> 795.46s]  No, Isshin is better.
[795.46s -> 797.89s]  Isshin is going down there, too, though.
[797.89s -> 802.65s]  Don't worry.
[802.65s -> 810.84s]  Where are you?
[810.84s -> 813.81s]  Godskin duel.
[813.81s -> 816.81s]  I like the Godskin stuff, but I feel like they showed up way too often.
[816.81s -> 819.14s]  I'll put Godric.
[819.14s -> 820.14s]  We'll do Godric.
[820.14s -> 826.09s]  I actually really liked that fight.
[826.09s -> 827.09s]  The music is great.
[827.09s -> 828.09s]  He laughs.
[828.09s -> 829.09s]  He has like a...
[829.09s -> 833.59s]  I like his moveset.
[833.59s -> 834.59s]  But I think...
[834.59s -> 835.59s]  Wait.
[835.59s -> 836.59s]  It's not gone today.
[836.59s -> 837.59s]  B plus for now.
[837.59s -> 838.77s]  For now.
[838.77s -> 843.40s]  Let's stay in Demon's Souls.
[843.40s -> 844.40s]  I'm going to all over the place.
[844.40s -> 845.40s]  Adjunct Cater.
[845.40s -> 846.40s]  What is that?
[846.40s -> 854.10s]  What is that?
[854.10s -> 855.10s]  Was this the thing with Big Tongue?
[855.10s -> 858.60s]  It was like a big fat guy, right?
[858.60s -> 869.06s]  Yeah, yeah.
[869.06s -> 870.30s]  I remember this.
[870.30s -> 872.30s]  Wasn't this the fight that you had to...
[872.30s -> 874.30s]  Yeah, you had to stand up here and throw shit at it?
[874.30s -> 877.90s]  F.
[877.90s -> 878.90s]  Yeah.
[878.90s -> 883.94s]  Tiny room, huge boss is already a C or below.
[883.94s -> 886.71s]  Yeah.
[886.71s -> 891.79s]  This is at least a D.
[891.79s -> 897.70s]  All the tiny room, huge bosses are going to get at least a C or minus.
[897.70s -> 898.70s]  Old Hero.
[898.70s -> 899.70s]  Right here.
[899.70s -> 908.45s]  This music is too intense for me.
[908.45s -> 912.80s]  I think this music is too intense.
[912.80s -> 920.80s]  What do you think?
[920.80s -> 926.09s]  Another hallway boss, which I'm not a big fan of.
[926.09s -> 928.09s]  I think this guy actually had a pretty cool moveset though.
[928.09s -> 929.09s]  From what I remember.
[929.09s -> 933.54s]  I remember this guy being fun to fight against.
[933.54s -> 941.89s]  What else did he do?
[941.89s -> 947.33s]  Yeah, we need like Animal Crossing music or something.
[947.33s -> 948.33s]  This is like...
[948.33s -> 953.45s]  I feel like I need to be screaming at you.
[953.45s -> 954.45s]  Yeah.
[954.45s -> 956.20s]  This was solid.
[956.20s -> 957.20s]  I remember.
[957.20s -> 960.23s]  This was solid.
[960.23s -> 961.23s]  Yeah, let's put on like...
[961.23s -> 962.23s]  Yeah, let's put on like Stardew Valley or something.
[962.23s -> 970.26s]  Stardew Valley.
[970.26s -> 973.54s]  That's like in easy listening.
[973.54s -> 974.54s]  I don't know.
[974.54s -> 975.54s]  I feel like I need to be like...
[975.54s -> 976.54s]  Run.
[976.54s -> 977.54s]  Everybody run.
[977.54s -> 978.54s]  Hey, there we go.
[978.54s -> 979.54s]  Now we can do it.
[979.54s -> 980.54s]  Get back to this.
[980.54s -> 991.38s]  I'm going to put Old Hero in C.
[991.38s -> 993.33s]  Storm King.
[993.33s -> 994.33s]  Storm King.
[994.33s -> 998.83s]  Let's see.
[998.83s -> 999.83s]  What was this one?
[999.83s -> 1000.83s]  I don't remember this at all.
[1000.83s -> 1002.46s]  And you're probably wondering, why do you not have the Demon's Souls remastered shit
[1002.46s -> 1003.46s]  up here?
[1003.46s -> 1023.43s]  Because I haven't played it yet and I'm going to probably eventually.
[1023.43s -> 1031.33s]  Oh, yeah.
[1031.33s -> 1032.33s]  It was a giant moth.
[1032.33s -> 1033.89s]  Yeah.
[1033.89s -> 1037.69s]  This is cool.
[1037.69s -> 1038.69s]  It was...
[1038.69s -> 1039.69s]  This was a gimmick fight.
[1039.69s -> 1040.69s]  How much of a gimmick was it though?
[1040.69s -> 1049.38s]  It's a manta ray.
[1049.38s -> 1051.14s]  The Stardew Valley music makes this like weird.
[1051.14s -> 1054.79s]  It was a gimmick fight.
[1054.79s -> 1057.57s]  Yeah.
[1057.57s -> 1059.37s]  Oh, didn't I hate this?
[1059.37s -> 1066.97s]  I talked a lot of shit about this.
[1066.97s -> 1069.33s]  I think I distinctly said this was awful.
[1069.33s -> 1073.96s]  Yeah.
[1073.96s -> 1078.27s]  Yeah.
[1078.27s -> 1079.27s]  This was...
[1079.27s -> 1088.70s]  You had to get the cyclone thing and it was freaking loud too.
[1088.70s -> 1094.25s]  Yeah, that's not that great.
[1094.25s -> 1095.25s]  All right.
[1095.25s -> 1096.25s]  Storm King.
[1096.25s -> 1097.25s]  Let's...
[1097.25s -> 1098.25s]  What about Leechmonger?
[1098.25s -> 1105.02s]  We'll do three or four of them.
[1105.02s -> 1109.21s]  Leechmonger is here.
[1109.21s -> 1111.73s]  This is the one where when you just being in the room, you got hurt.
[1111.73s -> 1117.13s]  Oh, yeah.
[1117.13s -> 1123.81s]  I hated this.
[1123.81s -> 1124.81s]  Yeah.
[1124.81s -> 1127.80s]  And there was no rhyme or reason to that move at all.
[1127.80s -> 1129.16s]  His arms just like flail around.
[1129.16s -> 1130.16s]  Yeah.
[1130.16s -> 1131.16s]  This fight was absolute dogshit.
[1131.16s -> 1136.23s]  Somebody said, Demon's Souls had some real stinkers.
[1136.23s -> 1137.54s]  Yeah.
[1137.54s -> 1140.25s]  Yeah.
[1140.25s -> 1141.25s]  That was terrible.
[1141.25s -> 1142.25s]  Okay.
[1142.25s -> 1149.31s]  Dirty Colossus.
[1149.31s -> 1154.39s]  Which one was this?
[1154.39s -> 1161.32s]  Honestly, I don't even remember fighting this.
[1161.32s -> 1163.92s]  I'm gonna have to put this a D because I don't remember.
[1163.92s -> 1168.58s]  I don't even remember this being in the game.
[1168.58s -> 1169.58s]  Okay.
[1169.58s -> 1171.40s]  So, cool.
[1171.40s -> 1172.76s]  So, Storm King.
[1172.76s -> 1177.96s]  That was pretty gimmicky.
[1177.96s -> 1185.06s]  I don't think it's F though.
[1185.06s -> 1186.06s]  It's pretty stupid.
[1186.06s -> 1188.23s]  Leechmonger, F. Dirty Colossus.
[1188.23s -> 1197.34s]  I'm gonna give it an F too because I don't even remember playing it.
[1197.34s -> 1199.96s]  Or almost through Demon's Souls.
[1199.96s -> 1203.69s]  Where's Flame Lurker?
[1203.69s -> 1204.69s]  I remember Flame Lurker.
[1204.69s -> 1207.18s]  You know how I remember Flame Lurker?
[1208.10s -> 1209.10s]  Because I beat this first try.
[1209.10s -> 1215.74s]  And everyone was really, really confused that I was able to do it.
[1215.74s -> 1220.54s]  This fight was really bad, but just because I beat it first try does not mean it's a good
[1220.54s -> 1226.38s]  fight.
[1226.38s -> 1227.38s]  Let me get refreshed on this again.
[1227.38s -> 1234.82s]  This is the guy that had all the explosions.
[1234.82s -> 1236.58s]  He jumped around a lot, right?
[1236.58s -> 1237.90s]  Let's get some, let's refresh.
[1237.90s -> 1246.30s]  Yeah.
[1246.30s -> 1258.74s]  This thing jumps all over the place and explodes.
[1258.74s -> 1261.94s]  It's cool, but yeah, those explosions were so horrible.
[1261.94s -> 1268.42s]  Even though I did beat it first try.
[1268.42s -> 1269.42s]  Way too dank.
[1269.42s -> 1271.24s]  What?
[1271.24s -> 1277.54s]  Can't even hear anything.
[1278.34s -> 1279.34s]  I'm gonna keep it in B.
[1279.34s -> 1281.54s]  Maiden, Astria.
[1281.54s -> 1287.14s]  I don't remember this fight either.
[1287.14s -> 1292.69s]  And if I don't remember you, that means you're probably down on the list really low.
[1292.69s -> 1293.69s]  It's two.
[1293.69s -> 1295.69s]  Maiden, Astria, and Garl, Vinland?
[1295.69s -> 1304.07s]  What the fuck was this?
[1304.07s -> 1305.07s]  What?
[1305.07s -> 1314.13s]  I don't, how could you forget this?
[1314.13s -> 1330.82s]  I just need to refresh my memory before I can tell you.
[1330.82s -> 1332.26s]  I don't remember doing this.
[1332.26s -> 1346.11s]  Wait, what?
[1346.11s -> 1349.08s]  Hold on.
[1349.08s -> 1364.72s]  You just get, you just walk down here and just kill her?
[1364.72s -> 1365.72s]  This is, all right.
[1365.80s -> 1368.03s]  I don't know about this.
[1368.03s -> 1371.90s]  I don't think this deserves to be anywhere higher than C.
[1371.90s -> 1376.37s]  But wait a minute.
[1376.37s -> 1380.19s]  It's a story boss?
[1380.19s -> 1383.03s]  Okay.
[1383.03s -> 1384.03s]  What about the penetrator?
[1384.03s -> 1391.74s]  Penetrator?
[1391.74s -> 1395.28s]  Where's the penetrator?
[1395.28s -> 1399.59s]  Dude, there's no penetrator.
[1399.59s -> 1400.59s]  Where's the penetrator?
[1400.59s -> 1415.30s]  Did you go by another name?
[1415.30s -> 1417.94s]  I went over it?
[1417.94s -> 1420.18s]  Old monk, man eater, bullseidle.
[1420.18s -> 1421.18s]  Oh, penetrator.
[1421.18s -> 1422.18s]  Okay.
[1422.18s -> 1431.81s]  I'm stupid.
[1431.81s -> 1432.81s]  Oh, I remember.
[1432.81s -> 1437.06s]  Yeah.
[1437.06s -> 1438.06s]  This was fun.
[1438.06s -> 1444.86s]  Give me a link to the list?
[1444.86s -> 1445.86s]  I will in a second.
[1445.86s -> 1450.82s]  I mean, kind of forgettable, but still fun.
[1450.82s -> 1457.15s]  I summoned an NPC on accident.
[1457.23s -> 1461.35s]  Okay.
[1461.35s -> 1462.35s]  Old king.
[1462.35s -> 1463.35s]  All right.
[1463.35s -> 1470.03s]  I remember the old king was a good, was a cool fight.
[1470.03s -> 1471.98s]  It was for a quest.
[1471.98s -> 1475.04s]  This is one of the last fights in the game.
[1475.04s -> 1476.47s]  Mm-hmm.
[1476.47s -> 1482.51s]  This was cool.
[1482.51s -> 1486.23s]  This was an easy last boss, but I don't think it was a bad fight.
[1486.23s -> 1487.23s]  It was a fun fight.
[1487.23s -> 1494.55s]  Yeah.
[1494.55s -> 1497.26s]  This was cool.
[1497.26s -> 1498.26s]  I need to do something else later as well.
[1498.26s -> 1507.52s]  This grab lowers your soul level, right?
[1507.52s -> 1509.46s]  Cool.
[1509.46s -> 1510.46s]  Okay.
[1510.46s -> 1513.45s]  Any more refreshers that I need before I do the rest of demon souls?
[1513.45s -> 1524.23s]  Primeval demon, I think I need to see.
[1524.23s -> 1526.23s]  I'm going to need this especially with the demon soul stuff.
[1526.23s -> 1527.23s]  It's been a long time.
[1532.39s -> 1538.18s]  Did I go over it again?
[1538.18s -> 1539.18s]  Primeval demon.
[1539.18s -> 1546.37s]  I don't think this one's on here.
[1546.37s -> 1548.89s]  It's not an official boss.
[1548.89s -> 1551.84s]  Oh, I don't remember this one.
[1551.84s -> 1556.55s]  Turn the music off?
[1556.55s -> 1558.03s]  You never saw primeval demon.
[1558.03s -> 1563.88s]  Oh, shit.
[1563.88s -> 1566.53s]  Turn it up.
[1566.53s -> 1572.17s]  It only spawns if you fuck the world up enough.
[1572.17s -> 1573.41s]  All right.
[1573.41s -> 1574.41s]  Well, then I can't place it.
[1574.41s -> 1584.88s]  I'm just going to put it down at, um, I'll add a category that says, let's call it, um,
[1584.88s -> 1588.00s]  I don't know is the category, but I didn't do it.
[1588.00s -> 1592.25s]  All right.
[1592.25s -> 1594.65s]  Only a couple more that I need to remember, but let's actually, let's, let's go back to
[1594.65s -> 1600.24s]  this and do these ones.
[1600.24s -> 1602.50s]  Okay.
[1603.30s -> 1604.54s]  Do primeval demon.
[1604.54s -> 1606.81s]  I didn't do it.
[1606.81s -> 1612.93s]  That maiden fight was, I mean, if you want to talk about in the entirety of all of from
[1612.93s -> 1618.97s]  software running down a hallway and killing five or six regular enemies to kill this lady
[1618.97s -> 1621.20s]  that's sitting on the ground.
[1621.20s -> 1624.68s]  I don't think compares with, uh, like father gas coin.
[1624.68s -> 1628.16s]  Okay.
[1628.16s -> 1629.96s]  But is that better than the phalanx?
[1629.96s -> 1632.29s]  Yeah.
[1632.29s -> 1637.02s]  Is that better than storm king?
[1637.02s -> 1639.48s]  No.
[1639.48s -> 1640.80s]  Cleric beast is better than armor spider armor.
[1640.80s -> 1645.05s]  But as a joke.
[1645.05s -> 1646.05s]  All right.
[1646.05s -> 1650.74s]  Penetrator.
[1651.14s -> 1652.14s]  Was a good narrative.
[1652.14s -> 1654.98s]  Yeah.
[1654.98s -> 1656.70s]  I'll put this at C. All the, okay.
[1656.70s -> 1664.56s]  All the guy that has a sword in his hand, I'm probably going to all be C. I like this
[1664.56s -> 1665.56s]  fight.
[1665.56s -> 1669.66s]  I'm going to put it to be, it might change vanguard demon.
[1669.66s -> 1673.07s]  This is the, um, this is the asylum demon, right?
[1673.07s -> 1679.18s]  Yeah, it is.
[1679.18s -> 1680.18s]  Yeah.
[1680.18s -> 1687.88s]  I mean, it's Ron Majula.
[1687.88s -> 1689.68s]  Oh, you actually know I'll put on dark souls too.
[1689.68s -> 1692.44s]  It's got a great OST Ron Majula.
[1692.44s -> 1694.13s]  Yeah.
[1694.13s -> 1697.86s]  I'll do that.
[1697.86s -> 1703.34s]  Uh, vanguard is probably like D stardew valley.
[1703.34s -> 1704.88s]  Like, yeah, it doesn't fit, but nothing.
[1704.88s -> 1705.88s]  What does fit right now?
[1705.88s -> 1710.07s]  Okay.
[1710.07s -> 1712.46s]  Give me a sec.
[1713.32s -> 1718.78s]  Uh, where is it?
[1718.78s -> 1725.85s]  Majula.
[1725.85s -> 1726.85s]  Majula extended.
[1726.85s -> 1729.50s]  Ooh.
[1729.50s -> 1734.38s]  Okay.
[1734.38s -> 1735.38s]  All right.
[1735.38s -> 1741.88s]  This might be the best hub world music without, yeah, that's probably the best one.
[1741.88s -> 1742.88s]  All right.
[1742.88s -> 1747.17s]  Uh, vanguard demon is, I really want to put it in F, but it's a tutorial boss, so it kind
[1747.17s -> 1748.17s]  of can't be there.
[1748.17s -> 1750.31s]  I don't know.
[1750.31s -> 1754.43s]  What are you guys think?
[1754.43s -> 1758.04s]  It's a tutorial boss.
[1758.04s -> 1760.96s]  Should any tutorial boss be allowed to be over D?
[1760.96s -> 1775.47s]  I don't think so, but that's a better fight than the maiden fight.
[1775.47s -> 1779.38s]  The maiden fight is just, is, is a better, at least you actually fight.
[1779.38s -> 1782.03s]  Hmm.
[1782.03s -> 1786.34s]  I'll keep it here for now.
[1786.34s -> 1793.96s]  Oh, there's also regular King Alant, right?
[1793.96s -> 1797.52s]  I already know where I'm putting like half of these, by the way.
[1797.52s -> 1803.68s]  I just saw this and immediately wanted to put it like down here.
[1803.68s -> 1804.68s]  Okay.
[1804.68s -> 1805.68s]  What is, what's a regular Alant?
[1805.68s -> 1809.38s]  Well, let's, let's look at the rest of these.
[1809.38s -> 1820.12s]  Blue dragon, old King Alant, King Alant.
[1820.12s -> 1821.12s]  Was this the actual last fight?
[1821.12s -> 1826.77s]  I don't remember.
[1826.77s -> 1837.79s]  Wait, is this when you kill the, the thing in one hit?
[1837.79s -> 1843.52s]  Oh yeah, this was fucking stupid.
[1843.52s -> 1850.69s]  This was fucking stupid.
[1850.69s -> 1852.65s]  Why is he talking like the TikTok filter?
[1853.37s -> 1862.80s]  Oh, I don't know what I'm seeing.
[1862.80s -> 1863.80s]  Okay.
[1863.80s -> 1864.80s]  That's not a good fight.
[1864.80s -> 1870.53s]  I mean, so, um, what about blue dragon?
[1870.53s -> 1871.53s]  Blue dragon and red dragon.
[1871.53s -> 1879.55s]  Power Knight was kind of, eh, like all the giants in Elden Ring.
[1879.55s -> 1900.38s]  Oh yeah, you could go up top.
[1900.38s -> 1901.38s]  This was actually pretty fun.
[1901.38s -> 1908.72s]  Let me get some more gameplay here.
[1908.72s -> 1912.33s]  Yeah, this was cool.
[1912.33s -> 1915.84s]  I remember it was a pain in the ass to kill the, uh, this stuff up top.
[1915.84s -> 1919.96s]  How come it's so long?
[1919.96s -> 1922.56s]  I think this is the guy that took a long time to kill it.
[1922.56s -> 1925.28s]  Yeah, no, this is cool.
[1925.28s -> 1926.28s]  I remember this.
[1926.44s -> 1927.44s]  It was, it was intense.
[1927.44s -> 1928.44s]  It was exhilarating.
[1928.44s -> 1935.85s]  Uh, so the dragon, the dragons were not technically bosses.
[1935.85s -> 1936.85s]  I don't, did I fight them?
[1936.85s -> 1938.41s]  I don't remember.
[1938.41s -> 1947.31s]  At least I can do these ones at this point.
[1947.31s -> 1951.88s]  Okay.
[1951.88s -> 1958.07s]  King Alant is F, but it's a funny F. It's not like a zero, right?
[1958.07s -> 1963.72s]  Oh, you want to link, right?
[1963.72s -> 1966.63s]  Hold on.
[1966.63s -> 1973.69s]  This is the one I'm using right now.
[1973.69s -> 1978.24s]  I don't even, why did I have to turn the screen off for that?
[1978.24s -> 1980.57s]  Power Knight.
[1980.57s -> 1981.57s]  Okay.
[1981.57s -> 1983.13s]  Was Tower Knight better than Penetrator?
[1983.13s -> 1984.13s]  Yes.
[1984.13s -> 1986.27s]  Was Tower Knight better than Old Hero?
[1986.27s -> 1987.27s]  Yes.
[1987.91s -> 1997.21s]  Was Tower Knight better than the Tibia Mariner?
[1997.21s -> 2010.36s]  Wait, actually, Tibia Mariner, I'm going to say no, I'll have to re, I have to think
[2010.36s -> 2014.36s]  about that again.
[2014.36s -> 2015.36s]  I just know what's going there.
[2015.36s -> 2019.73s]  So why not?
[2019.73s -> 2022.37s]  But Pinwheel, King, King Alant has to go all the way back here.
[2022.37s -> 2025.34s]  At least these are fights, but that's funny.
[2025.34s -> 2026.34s]  He makes funny sounds.
[2026.34s -> 2037.92s]  Oh, I'm going to burp.
[2037.92s -> 2038.92s]  That's the worst.
[2038.92s -> 2042.98s]  I think that actually might be the worst thing From Software has ever made.
[2042.98s -> 2044.41s]  I think so.
[2044.41s -> 2049.48s]  The Bed of Chaos, I think is truly just, they just mushed a bunch of stuff together and
[2049.48s -> 2054.17s]  just pressed it.
[2054.17s -> 2055.17s]  It's so awful.
[2055.17s -> 2056.17s]  It's just not even close.
[2056.17s -> 2059.52s]  I don't think.
[2059.52s -> 2064.75s]  The whole area was just, they just rushed through it as fast as possible.
[2064.75s -> 2068.83s]  That's probably the worst thing they've ever done.
[2068.83s -> 2069.83s]  I know that.
[2069.83s -> 2070.83s]  I'm going ahead.
[2070.83s -> 2075.46s]  I know.
[2075.46s -> 2079.07s]  I'm going ahead.
[2079.07s -> 2080.07s]  I know.
[2080.07s -> 2081.07s]  The Mario slide?
[2081.07s -> 2082.07s]  Yeah.
[2082.07s -> 2085.23s]  I hated that shit.
[2085.23s -> 2086.23s]  Yeah, that's definitely where it belongs.
[2086.23s -> 2087.23s]  Okay.
[2087.23s -> 2088.23s]  Wait, let me, let's go back.
[2088.23s -> 2089.98s]  Let me, let's refresh.
[2089.98s -> 2091.35s]  Dragon God fucking blows.
[2091.35s -> 2099.15s]  Is that the one where it's just you, it's a cutscene, right?
[2099.15s -> 2100.15s]  This is a cutscene, boss.
[2100.15s -> 2104.56s]  Am I accurate on saying that?
[2104.56s -> 2105.56s]  I remember it's a cutscene.
[2105.56s -> 2112.15s]  Yeah, this is pretty awful.
[2112.15s -> 2113.15s]  It's the stealth one.
[2113.15s -> 2116.76s]  Yeah.
[2116.76s -> 2117.76s]  No, I remember that.
[2117.76s -> 2119.51s]  It was dumb.
[2119.51s -> 2121.20s]  Is it on the video?
[2121.20s -> 2122.20s]  Dragon God, right?
[2122.20s -> 2127.92s]  I think it was.
[2127.92s -> 2129.67s]  Yup.
[2129.67s -> 2130.67s]  Yeah.
[2130.67s -> 2131.67s]  He spits the fire everywhere.
[2131.67s -> 2132.67s]  Is this not even a boss?
[2132.67s -> 2140.12s]  He goes near bed of chaos.
[2140.12s -> 2141.12s]  Yes.
[2141.12s -> 2142.12s]  All right.
[2142.12s -> 2146.49s]  Yeah.
[2146.49s -> 2147.49s]  Yeah.
[2147.49s -> 2150.52s]  Yeah.
[2150.52s -> 2151.52s]  Yeah.
[2151.52s -> 2153.53s]  Yeah.
[2153.53s -> 2154.53s]  This is down here.
[2154.53s -> 2157.12s]  He's got one hit kills.
[2157.12s -> 2160.21s]  He looks cool.
[2160.21s -> 2161.21s]  I am taking coolness into consideration, but not that much.
[2161.21s -> 2163.35s]  It's definitely cooler than bed of chaos.
[2163.35s -> 2164.59s]  Okay.
[2164.59s -> 2167.75s]  So I know what that is.
[2167.75s -> 2168.75s]  Fool's idol.
[2168.75s -> 2173.19s]  Saw that down here, right?
[2173.19s -> 2176.48s]  What was this one?
[2176.48s -> 2184.24s]  Arch, right?
[2184.24s -> 2185.24s]  The floor traps.
[2185.24s -> 2186.24s]  Yeah.
[2186.24s -> 2191.00s]  This thing sucks too.
[2191.00s -> 2194.44s]  And again, another one of my big problems from software games, I don't like fighting
[2194.44s -> 2199.04s]  a boss in a corridor that is like there's one kind of straight line and a bunch of shit
[2199.04s -> 2204.00s]  in the way.
[2204.00s -> 2207.60s]  Yeah.
[2207.60s -> 2215.38s]  You can get stuck spell casting and like the midi file that is that laugh.
[2215.38s -> 2218.22s]  Okay.
[2218.22s -> 2219.22s]  What about the man eater?
[2219.22s -> 2220.22s]  We're almost done with Demon's Souls.
[2220.22s -> 2228.05s]  Oh yeah.
[2228.05s -> 2229.05s]  I remember this.
[2229.05s -> 2234.63s]  This sucked.
[2234.63s -> 2235.63s]  Oh my God.
[2235.63s -> 2244.40s]  Are no Demon's Souls bosses even remotely close?
[2244.40s -> 2257.53s]  I don't think a single Demon's Souls boss is going to make it out of B. Okay.
[2257.53s -> 2258.53s]  Don't you fight two?
[2258.53s -> 2259.53s]  Yeah.
[2259.53s -> 2260.53s]  All right.
[2260.53s -> 2261.53s]  Yeah.
[2261.53s -> 2262.53s]  Yeah.
[2262.53s -> 2263.53s]  Yeah.
[2263.53s -> 2265.92s]  This is F. Yeah.
[2265.92s -> 2267.29s]  This is like, it's absolutely F. You fight two of these.
[2267.29s -> 2268.29s]  It's stupid.
[2268.29s -> 2272.48s]  All right.
[2272.48s -> 2274.04s]  I think I can put these out.
[2274.04s -> 2286.53s]  Uh, man eater is F. Fool's idol is like D. Man, this looks bad.
[2286.53s -> 2287.81s]  I don't remember these two.
[2287.81s -> 2292.08s]  Maybe I'll refresh my memory later.
[2292.08s -> 2293.08s]  Am I happy with this?
[2293.08s -> 2295.34s]  No, I'm not.
[2295.34s -> 2301.60s]  Cause Godric was definitely way cooler than the flame lurker.
[2301.60s -> 2308.80s]  I got to get Demon's Souls in the right place.
[2308.80s -> 2314.99s]  Is Gwyn better than flame lurker when the Gwyn fight kind of sucks though.
[2314.99s -> 2320.78s]  It's I'm only doing it because I say, come on Gwyn, like all the time, like seven years
[2320.78s -> 2332.45s]  later.
[2332.45s -> 2333.45s]  All right.
[2333.45s -> 2336.93s]  Is Ebritas better than Gwyn?
[2336.93s -> 2338.56s]  Yes.
[2338.56s -> 2339.92s]  Is old knight Alant better than Gwyn?
[2339.92s -> 2341.20s]  They're kind of the same thing for me.
[2341.20s -> 2342.20s]  They like in the same spot.
[2342.20s -> 2349.36s]  They feel very close in my brain.
[2349.36s -> 2351.84s]  I think this is good for me.
[2351.84s -> 2355.79s]  Ebritas is cooler than flame lurker.
[2355.79s -> 2360.00s]  Was the Tibia Mariner cooler than the monk?
[2360.00s -> 2362.48s]  I don't want recency bias to ruin this list.
[2362.48s -> 2377.15s]  No, I don't think so.
[2377.15s -> 2382.07s]  Hour knight probably cooler than Tibia Mariner.
[2382.07s -> 2384.57s]  Old hero probably cooler than Tibia Mariner.
[2384.57s -> 2387.78s]  Penetrator definitely not.
[2387.78s -> 2392.40s]  Lyric beast better than Penetrator.
[2392.40s -> 2393.72s]  Armor spider is bad.
[2393.72s -> 2395.16s]  Okay.
[2395.16s -> 2401.88s]  I think I'm okay with this so far.
[2401.88s -> 2410.77s]  Godric is at least a low A. I'm thinking about it.
[2410.77s -> 2412.73s]  I don't, I think gas coin was cool than Godric.
[2412.73s -> 2415.17s]  At least for now.
[2415.17s -> 2416.17s]  Give us the list.
[2416.17s -> 2417.17s]  I put it, I already put it in chat.
[2417.17s -> 2418.17s]  It's already there.
[2418.17s -> 2420.76s]  I already put it there.
[2420.76s -> 2421.76s]  Am I too much of a big head?
[2421.76s -> 2423.56s]  Should I have like more space like here?
[2423.56s -> 2428.49s]  What do you guys think?
[2428.49s -> 2429.49s]  Right?
[2429.49s -> 2430.49s]  Like I'm just kind of like a big floating head.
[2430.49s -> 2436.66s]  Yeah, that's like better.
[2436.66s -> 2437.66s]  I'm like a person here now.
[2437.66s -> 2445.34s]  I'm not just like, okay, that's better.
[2445.34s -> 2448.37s]  All right.
[2448.37s -> 2449.37s]  Ornstein and Sma.
[2449.37s -> 2450.37s]  Um, am I happy with this?
[2450.37s -> 2452.85s]  We're, we're, for now I am.
[2452.85s -> 2457.16s]  Beta chaos, worst.
[2457.16s -> 2463.52s]  Dragon god's probably low as well, but the, he was cool looking.
[2463.52s -> 2470.12s]  Vanguard demon is better than that.
[2470.12s -> 2474.87s]  The D and F is just all demon souls fights.
[2474.87s -> 2486.70s]  I kind of feel bad, but unless something changes, I think that this is correct.
[2486.70s -> 2488.69s]  Definitely cooler than the flame lurker.
[2488.69s -> 2493.61s]  Not cooler than Ibrutas in a way.
[2493.61s -> 2494.61s]  All right.
[2494.61s -> 2495.61s]  Now we're into Dark Souls 1 stuff.
[2495.77s -> 2496.77s]  I need some refreshers.
[2496.77s -> 2499.78s]  I have them, but I do remember most of these.
[2499.78s -> 2509.50s]  Moonlight butterfly was pretty cool, but was it cooler than the Tibia Mariner?
[2509.50s -> 2510.50s]  I don't know.
[2510.50s -> 2518.14s]  They're kind of the same fight.
[2518.14s -> 2523.99s]  Let's get the Taurus demon out of the way because it's just going to be down here.
[2523.99s -> 2524.99s]  All right.
[2524.99s -> 2528.99s]  Taurus demon is probably, they're the same exact fight, so why not just put them in the
[2528.99s -> 2536.56s]  same place?
[2536.56s -> 2539.56s]  Sif was cool.
[2539.56s -> 2545.86s]  I think Sif might have to be up in A for now or maybe high B. I don't want to go too high
[2545.86s -> 2554.59s]  with Sif.
[2554.59s -> 2556.76s]  Wait, the Taurus, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[2557.24s -> 2560.16s]  The asylum demon and vanguard demon are the same.
[2560.16s -> 2566.03s]  Not the Taurus demon is the one on the bridge, which that was okay.
[2566.03s -> 2569.83s]  Again, these two are just in the same exact category for me.
[2569.83s -> 2587.22s]  You're both on a bridge and you're both huge and you're both too big for the bridge.
[2587.22s -> 2589.92s]  This is the scorpion chaos witch, right?
[2589.92s -> 2592.25s]  The scorpion lady.
[2592.25s -> 2593.43s]  That was all right.
[2593.43s -> 2602.76s]  That didn't wow me, but it was okay.
[2602.76s -> 2609.80s]  The bell gargoyles were like, mm, they weren't great either.
[2609.80s -> 2614.41s]  Capra demon F. Even if that you beat that fight really easily, it's stupid.
[2614.41s -> 2615.41s]  It's a terrible fight.
[2615.92s -> 2620.92s]  Let's make a room as big as an apartment bathroom and you fight this fucking annoying thing
[2620.92s -> 2622.54s]  in it.
[2622.54s -> 2623.54s]  And there's two dogs here.
[2623.54s -> 2628.75s]  It's awful.
[2628.75s -> 2630.56s]  I actually liked gaping dragon.
[2630.56s -> 2632.56s]  I like when he goes all the way forward.
[2632.56s -> 2640.45s]  I don't know if it's a gaping dragon was a cool was cool.
[2640.45s -> 2642.48s]  It was a weird bus and weird.
[2642.48s -> 2645.47s]  It was a really weird fight.
[2645.47s -> 2646.67s]  He hates all these bosses.
[2646.67s -> 2652.12s]  No, I'm trying to be fair.
[2652.12s -> 2656.43s]  This is the one that just spams down the hall, right?
[2656.43s -> 2660.27s]  It's the fight is you just literally have to run down the hall with the magic.
[2660.27s -> 2661.76s]  The caster.
[2661.76s -> 2662.76s]  Yes.
[2662.76s -> 2664.64s]  This is F.
[2664.84s -> 2676.26s]  But it's F.
[2676.26s -> 2679.61s]  That's F.
[2679.61s -> 2682.17s]  F is going to need a lot of moving around because I'm going to have to kind of go one
[2682.17s -> 2685.08s]  by one.
[2685.08s -> 2686.08s]  Nito.
[2686.08s -> 2692.76s]  Actually, let me get the other because I have the Dark Souls one bosses to get those up.
[2692.76s -> 2695.36s]  I remember Nito with Nito summons a bunch of shit, right?
[2695.36s -> 2701.02s]  Where is it?
[2701.02s -> 2702.58s]  Let's look at it.
[2702.58s -> 2703.58s]  Nito was was interesting, right?
[2703.58s -> 2704.58s]  From what I remember.
[2704.58s -> 2725.36s]  I'm going to need this for a few of these does the undead guy come in here and he summons
[2725.36s -> 2729.68s]  a bunch of skeletons and you have to run around the circle and this guy actually has really
[2729.68s -> 2730.68s]  annoying moves.
[2730.68s -> 2736.60s]  Yeah.
[2736.60s -> 2737.60s]  He doesn't just chase you down.
[2737.60s -> 2743.66s]  This was horrible.
[2743.66s -> 2748.02s]  He's also in the worst area in the game.
[2748.02s -> 2750.12s]  I don't think this is F though.
[2750.12s -> 2751.72s]  I think the boss design is cool.
[2751.72s -> 2755.60s]  I mean, it's a big thing of melded together skeletons and summoned skeletons.
[2755.60s -> 2756.88s]  I think it was cool.
[2756.88s -> 2761.56s]  I don't think it belongs below C. I don't know if it goes below above B though.
[2761.56s -> 2765.74s]  Yeah.
[2765.74s -> 2766.74s]  Okay.
[2766.74s -> 2768.56s]  I remember that one.
[2768.56s -> 2769.56s]  The four kings.
[2769.56s -> 2778.89s]  This is the one where it's just pitch black, right?
[2778.89s -> 2779.89s]  This was all right.
[2779.89s -> 2790.39s]  The design of the boss carries this one.
[2790.39s -> 2793.39s]  The fight is F, but the design is like B.
[2793.47s -> 2797.18s]  So I think it's go somewhere in the middle.
[2797.18s -> 2798.18s]  Yeah.
[2798.18s -> 2799.18s]  This is stupid.
[2799.18s -> 2800.18s]  Yeah.
[2800.18s -> 2801.18s]  Yeah.
[2801.18s -> 2802.18s]  Yeah.
[2802.18s -> 2803.18s]  Yeah.
[2803.18s -> 2804.18s]  Yeah.
[2804.18s -> 2808.11s]  Yeah.
[2808.11s -> 2812.29s]  Yeah.
[2812.29s -> 2813.29s]  Yeah.
[2813.29s -> 2816.32s]  Yeah.
[2816.32s -> 2817.32s]  Yeah.
[2817.32s -> 2819.20s]  Yeah.
[2819.20s -> 2820.20s]  Yeah.
[2820.20s -> 2821.20s]  Yeah.
[2821.20s -> 2822.20s]  Yeah.
[2822.20s -> 2824.53s]  Yeah.
[2824.53s -> 2825.53s]  Yeah.
[2825.53s -> 2826.53s]  Yeah.
[2826.53s -> 2827.53s]  Yeah.
[2827.53s -> 2828.53s]  Yeah.
[2828.53s -> 2830.54s]  Yeah.
[2830.54s -> 2831.54s]  Yeah.
[2831.54s -> 2832.78s]  Yeah.
[2832.78s -> 2833.78s]  Yeah.
[2833.78s -> 2834.78s]  All right.
[2834.78s -> 2835.78s]  Demon.
[2835.78s -> 2836.78s]  Is this the one where it has the stupid thing that you just walk into?
[2839.19s -> 2845.43s]  I actually might put this below bed of chaos just because of how truly dumb this thing
[2845.43s -> 2849.93s]  was.
[2849.93s -> 2850.93s]  Yeah.
[2850.93s -> 2854.32s]  The Capra Demon takes three hits to kill.
[2854.32s -> 2858.24s]  There's nothing fun about this.
[2858.24s -> 2859.24s]  Art equals bad.
[2859.24s -> 2863.44s]  I mean, but objectively speaking, this area is stupid.
[2863.44s -> 2864.44s]  This boss is stupid.
[2864.44s -> 2871.57s]  Look, the person even making the video on let me show you the bosses is having trouble
[2871.57s -> 2875.51s]  with this because of how annoying this is.
[2875.51s -> 2883.00s]  And the guy in the video showing us this encounter is that he can't even do anything.
[2883.00s -> 2891.90s]  This is a way useful.
[2891.90s -> 2892.90s]  You fight this piece of shit.
[2892.90s -> 2896.25s]  He's gonna die.
[2896.25s -> 2901.14s]  Yeah.
[2901.14s -> 2902.14s]  You got to let him.
[2902.14s -> 2903.14s]  That's it.
[2903.14s -> 2905.02s]  That's what you do.
[2905.02s -> 2907.54s]  Yeah.
[2907.54s -> 2908.54s]  Okay.
[2908.54s -> 2909.54s]  My opinion is validated for myself.
[2909.54s -> 2910.54s]  Okay.
[2910.54s -> 2913.03s]  The Demon Fire Sage.
[2913.03s -> 2916.59s]  This is the one that had the area was small and you'd walk backwards and fall directly
[2916.59s -> 2917.59s]  into the lava and die.
[2917.59s -> 2920.36s]  Right?
[2920.36s -> 2922.32s]  Because that was annoying.
[2922.32s -> 2923.88s]  The fights actually get the fight.
[2923.88s -> 2924.88s]  Yeah.
[2925.28s -> 2929.04s]  The fight's actually kind of fun though.
[2929.04s -> 2932.32s]  I wouldn't say it's a bad fight.
[2932.32s -> 2933.32s]  Demon Fire Sage.
[2933.32s -> 2934.32s]  Where the fuck is this?
[2934.32s -> 2949.67s]  I'm like halfway through the game, right?
[2949.67s -> 2950.67s]  Elgar Goyles.
[2950.67s -> 2952.29s]  Where is it?
[2952.29s -> 2953.29s]  The right?
[2953.29s -> 2954.29s]  Did I miss it again?
[2954.29s -> 2958.27s]  Am I still doing this?
[2958.27s -> 2959.27s]  War Kings pinwheel.
[2959.27s -> 2960.27s]  Cease.
[2960.27s -> 2962.03s]  Is it not ceaseless discharge?
[2962.03s -> 2966.76s]  No.
[2966.76s -> 2968.08s]  Read video description for timestamps.
[2968.08s -> 2975.48s]  But I mean, it's right here.
[2975.48s -> 2976.48s]  It's right here.
[2976.48s -> 2977.48s]  Like, how have I not seen it?
[2977.48s -> 2983.42s]  This shit's not even here.
[2983.46s -> 2987.52s]  I'm not gonna go look until I find it because I really don't think it's here.
[2987.52s -> 2988.52s]  Stray Demon?
[2988.52s -> 2995.13s]  It's not...
[2995.13s -> 2996.13s]  Oh, there it is.
[2996.13s -> 3003.52s]  Okay.
[3003.52s -> 3008.44s]  Ceaseless discharge is what I was thinking of.
[3008.44s -> 3010.48s]  This is just an Asylum Demon that has fire.
[3010.48s -> 3016.58s]  I'm gonna say pretty low.
[3016.58s -> 3020.54s]  It's probably better if I would put it above Asylum Demon because at least it's a different
[3020.54s -> 3021.54s]  thing.
[3021.54s -> 3027.20s]  He's on fire.
[3027.20s -> 3030.04s]  Yeah, okay.
[3030.04s -> 3044.76s]  I need Centipede Demon which is right here.
[3044.76s -> 3055.75s]  I don't remember this one.
[3055.75s -> 3058.71s]  I think a lot of the ones I don't remember I blocked out of my memory because I might
[3058.71s -> 3060.03s]  have hated them so much.
[3065.98s -> 3067.54s]  This guy almost just died instantly.
[3067.54s -> 3075.02s]  What the hell happened?
[3075.02s -> 3077.06s]  This guy's character looks like such a goofball.
[3077.06s -> 3084.00s]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[3084.00s -> 3085.00s]  It's coming back to me.
[3085.00s -> 3093.72s]  Because you have to put a ring on, right?
[3093.72s -> 3095.16s]  You need the lava ring.
[3095.16s -> 3100.82s]  Yeah.
[3100.82s -> 3102.00s]  Okay.
[3102.00s -> 3104.00s]  Cool.
[3104.00s -> 3105.00s]  I remember Seath.
[3105.00s -> 3111.99s]  Seath is, design-wise, I think is at least A.
[3111.99s -> 3118.64s]  It's such a weird, just kind of like gooey.
[3118.64s -> 3119.96s]  This fight was not fun though.
[3119.96s -> 3123.63s]  It was kind of sloppy.
[3123.63s -> 3125.39s]  I love the way this dragon looks.
[3125.39s -> 3143.64s]  This, eh, I don't think it's that bad.
[3143.64s -> 3144.64s]  It's a cool fight.
[3144.64s -> 3148.84s]  It's, well, the fight's not great, but it's not terrible.
[3148.84s -> 3149.84s]  Okay, yeah.
[3149.84s -> 3151.96s]  I'd say that goes somewhere in C.
[3151.96s -> 3154.89s]  Alright, Stray Demon.
[3154.89s -> 3161.21s]  This is the one that, after Stray Demon we'll do some placement, Stray Demons.
[3161.21s -> 3163.81s]  The one, okay, I don't think I even need to look at Stray Demon.
[3163.81s -> 3173.59s]  That's the one that you fall through the ground and it's just an Asylum Demon, right?
[3176.73s -> 3180.81s]  The surprising factor makes this kind of cool, but the actual boss is just another Asylum
[3180.81s -> 3185.37s]  Demon with a couple extra attacks, yeah.
[3185.37s -> 3191.25s]  Okay, I can do some placement.
[3191.25s -> 3192.25s]  I think I got it.
[3192.25s -> 3198.23s]  I got some placement here.
[3198.23s -> 3208.19s]  Uh, Nito's going up to C. Four kings are D. I-D though, for now.
[3208.19s -> 3213.32s]  Centipede team, uh, D. Do I even like these games?
[3213.32s -> 3215.80s]  Demon Fire Sage was, oh no, it was Seath.
[3215.80s -> 3229.79s]  Seath is like C. Stray Demon is like D. Demon's Fire Sage was
[3229.79s -> 3234.51s]  just, it's just another Demon.
[3234.51s -> 3242.00s]  How come the Storm King is so low?
[3242.00s -> 3243.00s]  I'm just trying to get things out.
[3243.00s -> 3246.68s]  This is a very hard thing to do.
[3246.68s -> 3248.36s]  Barely anything is above average right now.
[3248.36s -> 3256.00s]  I fucking hate From Software games, apparently.
[3256.00s -> 3260.20s]  I remember the DLC fights where, okay, this, the night.
[3260.20s -> 3262.60s]  I remember the night being really, really fun.
[3262.60s -> 3264.36s]  The night was really cool, actually.
[3264.36s -> 3268.98s]  This is one of those fights that I remember was cool.
[3268.98s -> 3271.06s]  Like I actually really enjoyed it.
[3271.06s -> 3272.49s]  Night, Artorias.
[3272.73s -> 3288.39s]  Let me just, let me refresh my memory.
[3288.39s -> 3295.20s]  This is the guy that uses one, the one hand to swing, right?
[3295.20s -> 3296.20s]  The one handed knight.
[3296.20s -> 3301.67s]  Yeah, this was awesome.
[3301.67s -> 3304.29s]  This is going at least today.
[3304.29s -> 3311.26s]  And you want to know why Gale is at S?
[3311.26s -> 3315.91s]  Because this fight, Gale was just kind of a cooler version of this fight.
[3315.91s -> 3330.33s]  I mean, let me refresh my memory.
[3330.33s -> 3331.69s]  All the cool swings with the one arm.
[3331.69s -> 3332.69s]  Yeah, this fight was awesome.
[3332.69s -> 3341.58s]  I mean, he's going to kill it in like fucking five seconds, but you know, with a thousand
[3341.62s -> 3347.06s]  damaged sorceries.
[3347.06s -> 3348.94s]  This was really fun though, I remember.
[3348.94s -> 3352.81s]  This was a dance.
[3352.81s -> 3356.89s]  This is one of those From Software fights where they got it really right because it
[3356.89s -> 3364.08s]  really does feel like a fencing match between the two characters.
[3364.08s -> 3365.72s]  That's why I like Horror Lou so much.
[3365.72s -> 3370.54s]  That felt like I was fighting that boss.
[3370.54s -> 3372.66s]  It was a back and forth dance.
[3372.66s -> 3374.74s]  That's why Horror Lou might actually be number one.
[3374.74s -> 3379.70s]  Okay, I know where that's going.
[3379.70s -> 3382.28s]  That's going up pretty high.
[3382.28s -> 3385.12s]  Sanctuary of Guardian, I think I hated, right?
[3385.12s -> 3386.44s]  It was just like this thing.
[3386.68s -> 3396.99s]  Yeah, don't you fight two of them too at some point as well and it's just annoying.
[3396.99s -> 3413.54s]  He's killing him so fast.
[3413.54s -> 3414.54s]  I just need refreshers.
[3414.54s -> 3418.21s]  That one was alright.
[3418.21s -> 3421.17s]  I remember being angry at the way you have to fight two, so that's kind of souring how
[3421.17s -> 3423.35s]  I feel about fighting the one.
[3423.35s -> 3427.19s]  Which I hope that doesn't happen with the Elden Ring bosses, because needing to fight
[3427.19s -> 3431.24s]  two of those godskin apostles was just, come on.
[3431.24s -> 3434.80s]  Fighting two of this thing was always just annoying, and it might sour.
[3434.80s -> 3440.32s]  Alright, I'm just checking the rest of the DLC.
[3440.32s -> 3445.33s]  We have Crossbreed Priscilla, I don't remember this.
[3445.33s -> 3457.89s]  Oh, I do remember this.
[3457.89s -> 3462.16s]  This is the invisible fight.
[3462.16s -> 3463.16s]  And it was awful.
[3463.16s -> 3471.51s]  Yeah, you fight the invisible character.
[3471.51s -> 3481.06s]  Yeah, come on.
[3481.06s -> 3487.68s]  Where is it?
[3487.68s -> 3488.68s]  Wait, what?
[3488.68s -> 3493.79s]  They just beat it in one hit?
[3493.79s -> 3508.67s]  Alright, we need the Dragon Calamite, and then Manus, and Iron Golem was alright.
[3509.55s -> 3511.07s]  Alright, what about the Dragon Calamite?
[3511.07s -> 3534.90s]  Yeah, this was cool.
[3534.90s -> 3539.34s]  You know what's going to be really, really sad though, for when this was a fun fight?
[3539.34s -> 3544.46s]  Oh my goodness, does it even hold a candle to even one of the dragon fights in Elden
[3544.46s -> 3549.30s]  Ring?
[3549.30s -> 3553.56s]  How do you put this even close to Placidix?
[3553.56s -> 3554.56s]  I don't know.
[3554.56s -> 3559.10s]  That's going to be hard.
[3559.10s -> 3562.46s]  Then let's round it out, Iron Golem, just so I can make sure I know.
[3562.46s -> 3574.07s]  It was pretty early, right?
[3574.07s -> 3575.07s]  It's so much better.
[3575.07s -> 3577.73s]  Better than the Overworld Dragons.
[3577.73s -> 3578.93s]  Yeah, that's true.
[3578.93s -> 3586.35s]  But that first encounter with Agil was ridiculous.
[3586.35s -> 3596.81s]  It's just kind of a tower knight, but maybe not as cool.
[3596.81s -> 3603.66s]  Yeah, it's another one of those things where I fight me on a tiny area.
[3603.66s -> 3612.64s]  Yeah, this is a D. Or like a high D.
[3612.64s -> 3618.32s]  Alright, it's time to place.
[3618.32s -> 3619.32s]  I got enough info.
[3619.32s -> 3624.57s]  Welcome back.
[3624.57s -> 3625.57s]  Uh, this is...
[3625.57s -> 3630.17s]  I mean, the fight is just, she's invisible.
[3630.17s -> 3631.17s]  Invisible.
[3633.64s -> 3638.74s]  How do you give that a high score?
[3638.74s -> 3645.16s]  I don't think it's worse than the Four Kings.
[3645.16s -> 3648.40s]  Sanctuary Guardian was cool, I'll get these right.
[3648.40s -> 3652.44s]  Dragon, I'm going to put in B for now, but just keep in mind that Ibritas is in B as
[3652.44s -> 3653.44s]  well.
[3653.44s -> 3658.46s]  B does not mean bad.
[3658.46s -> 3660.58s]  Oh, the Ceaseless Discharge, that thing, yeah.
[3660.58s -> 3668.72s]  This thing was like a C. That's where you fall, yeah, fuck that thing.
[3668.72s -> 3670.24s]  I didn't see Manus, did I?
[3670.24s -> 3685.72s]  No, did I see Manus?
[3685.76s -> 3688.24s]  Oh yeah, this thing was crazy.
[3688.24s -> 3698.05s]  Yeah, this thing was actually really cool.
[3698.05s -> 3704.96s]  It's just what all the Asylum Demons like wished they were as a fight.
[3704.96s -> 3712.78s]  Mm-hmm.
[3712.78s -> 3715.82s]  Yeah, this is at least a B. Alright, Dark Souls 1 is a- I- we're gonna take a minute
[3715.82s -> 3720.95s]  here because I need to make sure these are in the right spot.
[3720.95s -> 3727.99s]  I'm gonna put this in B for now.
[3727.99s -> 3731.75s]  Dark Souls 2 is gonna be as hard as Demon's Souls because it's been a very long time since
[3731.75s -> 3733.15s]  I've played Dark Souls 2.
[3733.15s -> 3740.96s]  I'm actually probably gonna do that last.
[3740.96s -> 3744.89s]  So, let's begin.
[3744.89s -> 3750.63s]  Ornstein and Smog.
[3750.63s -> 3753.15s]  Was our Artorias cooler than Sif?
[3753.15s -> 3758.08s]  Was he more fun, more interesting?
[3758.08s -> 3759.08s]  I don't know.
[3759.08s -> 3769.49s]  Everybody, look, I know that From Software has put a like wolf or like an animal with
[3769.49s -> 3771.17s]  like a sword in his mouth.
[3771.17s -> 3776.68s]  I know they've done like the look it's a wolf enemy again like a thousand times.
[3776.68s -> 3790.44s]  But in Dark Souls 1, that first seeing that for the first time was really cool.
[3790.44s -> 3796.20s]  I'm gonna keep it there for now.
[3796.20s -> 3798.64s]  Is Ibritas better than Artorias?
[3798.64s -> 3802.85s]  God, I fucking love Bloodborne.
[3802.85s -> 3803.85s]  I just do.
[3803.85s -> 3804.85s]  I'm so biased.
[3804.85s -> 3805.85s]  It's awful.
[3805.85s -> 3808.50s]  I'm so biased.
[3808.50s -> 3813.86s]  Because the music, Ibritas' music is so cool.
[3813.86s -> 3819.82s]  That like, it's just such a, it's amazing.
[3819.82s -> 3821.78s]  Music in Bloodborne makes these bosses better.
[3821.78s -> 3832.12s]  That like, it felt like I was on a cosmic journey.
[3832.12s -> 3839.38s]  It's going up here.
[3839.38s -> 3844.27s]  This might change.
[3844.27s -> 3848.90s]  Gaping Dragon is probably not close to this.
[3848.90s -> 3849.90s]  You should play it.
[3849.90s -> 3850.90s]  Yeah!
[3850.90s -> 3851.90s]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[3855.17s -> 3856.17s]  I don't know why I keep pressing that button.
[3856.17s -> 3857.17s]  I'm an idiot.
[3857.17s -> 3866.41s]  Here it comes.
[3866.41s -> 3867.41s]  Turn it up.
[3867.41s -> 3878.82s]  I'm gonna put both headphones in this because Ibritas might go higher.
[3878.82s -> 3887.92s]  Bloodborne's music is by far the best out of any of these games, without a doubt.
[3887.92s -> 3928.04s]  Wait for it.
[3928.04s -> 3929.04s]  Godric's music is good too.
[3929.04s -> 3931.88s]  And you know what makes a good song for me?
[3931.88s -> 3932.88s]  It's, I've figured it out.
[3932.88s -> 3934.88s]  Any of the bosses that have like the...
[3934.88s -> 3942.44s]  Ludwig has it.
[3942.44s -> 3943.44s]  Godric has it.
[3943.44s -> 3944.44s]  Ibritas has it.
[3944.44s -> 3946.38s]  They all have it.
[3946.38s -> 3948.90s]  Not the chorus.
[3948.90s -> 3954.14s]  Godric's music does this thing where it goes, is it a violin?
[3954.14s -> 3955.14s]  What's that instrument?
[3955.14s -> 3957.73s]  If it has a violin, I like it.
[3957.73s -> 3966.59s]  Okay.
[3966.59s -> 3967.89s]  Let's keep going.
[3967.89s -> 3968.89s]  I think these are in the right spot.
[3968.89s -> 3969.89s]  Gwyn is probably...
[3969.89s -> 3970.89s]  Flame Lurker and Gwyn are like this.
[3970.89s -> 3972.89s]  Like these are all like the same fight.
[3972.89s -> 3979.81s]  Doesn't really matter.
[3979.81s -> 3980.91s]  This is cooler.
[3980.91s -> 3981.91s]  This is cooler.
[3983.04s -> 3986.94s]  This is cooler than Flame Lurker.
[3986.94s -> 3988.94s]  Ornstein and Smog was probably...
[3988.94s -> 3994.47s]  Yeah.
[3994.47s -> 3995.95s]  Slave Knight Gael's music was amazing.
[3995.95s -> 3996.95s]  Oh yeah, it was.
[3996.95s -> 4003.85s]  Ludwig's music is the best, without a doubt.
[4003.85s -> 4008.61s]  Nothing compares.
[4008.61s -> 4009.61s]  What about Medir?
[4009.61s -> 4011.85s]  Alright, let's get this right.
[4011.85s -> 4012.85s]  That looks good.
[4012.85s -> 4013.85s]  That looks good.
[4013.85s -> 4014.85s]  That looks good.
[4014.85s -> 4015.85s]  Gaping Dragon is in a good spot.
[4015.85s -> 4016.85s]  I think Gaping...
[4016.85s -> 4017.85s]  Gwyn's probably...
[4017.85s -> 4018.85s]  Gaping Dragon, I don't know.
[4018.85s -> 4019.85s]  It's so hard to tell.
[4019.85s -> 4024.35s]  I just...
[4024.35s -> 4025.71s]  I think Ibritas is cooler than Sif.
[4025.71s -> 4026.71s]  I do.
[4026.71s -> 4029.15s]  Alright.
[4029.15s -> 4032.78s]  Go down here.
[4032.78s -> 4033.78s]  Four Kings is better than this.
[4033.82s -> 4042.72s]  I'm going to put this pretty low.
[4042.72s -> 4052.43s]  I so badly want to put the Armor Spider lower, but I don't think I can.
[4052.43s -> 4056.36s]  This sucked.
[4056.36s -> 4061.97s]  I almost feel like somebody needs to level up here.
[4061.97s -> 4065.93s]  I don't know which one's going to level up.
[4065.93s -> 4066.93s]  These are all the same.
[4066.93s -> 4076.88s]  Xenopy Demon, what's the worst out of all of these?
[4076.88s -> 4077.88s]  Probably these, right?
[4077.88s -> 4083.78s]  Yeah, Junk Decatur's so bad.
[4083.78s -> 4084.78s]  It's going down here too.
[4084.78s -> 4088.27s]  I just got a baby formula add?
[4088.27s -> 4095.87s]  I don't know how you fucking got that.
[4095.87s -> 4098.67s]  Was the Penetrator that bad of a fight?
[4098.67s -> 4103.10s]  Or was it just kind of like...
[4103.10s -> 4104.58s]  I feel like it doesn't belong down there.
[4104.58s -> 4117.81s]  It was a regular enemy.
[4117.81s -> 4118.81s]  I think it should be.
[4118.81s -> 4119.81s]  I mean, it was still...
[4119.81s -> 4120.81s]  It's cooler than the Four Kings.
[4120.81s -> 4123.85s]  The Four Kings is just a pitch black room and they teleport next to you.
[4123.85s -> 4131.26s]  I'm alright with this for now.
[4131.26s -> 4134.70s]  Now for Bloodborne, I am not going to need to do any...
[4134.70s -> 4136.46s]  I don't need to refresh at all for Bloodborne.
[4136.46s -> 4139.21s]  I know all of these by heart.
[4139.21s -> 4141.17s]  Maybe some of them I might want to just take a quick look at.
[4141.17s -> 4145.02s]  So we're going to skip Dark Souls 2 for now.
[4145.02s -> 4153.50s]  Because Dark Souls 2, that's going to take us the longest time, I think.
[4154.26s -> 4155.26s]  Yeah, I'll remember you.
[4155.26s -> 4156.26s]  Yeah, it's better that way.
[4156.26s -> 4157.26s]  It's more fun.
[4157.26s -> 4161.29s]  So let's open up...
[4161.29s -> 4162.29s]  Let's get Bloodborne up here.
[4162.29s -> 4166.50s]  Because Dark Souls 1 is complete.
[4166.50s -> 4170.41s]  Nobody from Dark Souls 1 got to S.
[4170.41s -> 4174.65s]  Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, and Elden Ring all have a representative up here at S.
[4174.65s -> 4176.87s]  Dark Souls 1 does not.
[4176.87s -> 4182.50s]  Is that fair?
[4182.50s -> 4186.76s]  I think so.
[4186.76s -> 4192.35s]  I think so.
[4192.35s -> 4193.78s]  Okay.
[4193.78s -> 4194.78s]  Bloodborne time.
[4196.01s -> 4202.37s]  So if you remember from Bloodborne, Leric Beast is already up there at S.
[4202.37s -> 4208.18s]  Eh, I think that's fine where it is.
[4208.18s -> 4213.83s]  So we've got the one Reborn, which I believe this fight was...
[4213.83s -> 4216.19s]  I wasn't a big fan of it, but let's refresh our memory.
[4216.19s -> 4218.99s]  There's the big blob enemy, right?
[4218.99s -> 4225.79s]  Yeah, this is just a huge blob.
[4225.79s -> 4232.54s]  This thing was annoying.
[4232.54s -> 4234.02s]  This is probably going to be one of the lower ones.
[4234.02s -> 4245.06s]  Okay, let's put it up here.
[4245.06s -> 4247.02s]  I don't know where Rom's going to go.
[4247.02s -> 4250.86s]  Rom's area and Rom's scariness was there, but nothing else for me.
[4250.86s -> 4256.16s]  Yeah, this fight was...
[4256.16s -> 4257.16s]  I didn't like this.
[4257.16s -> 4268.54s]  I actually didn't really like this area that much either.
[4268.54s -> 4269.54s]  The thing to swing...
[4269.54s -> 4274.10s]  All of its extremities were just always attacking, and it was no opportunity to do anything.
[4274.10s -> 4275.10s]  Just spit a bunch of...
[4275.10s -> 4276.10s]  Yeah, this thing was...
[4276.10s -> 4281.10s]  Yeah, this is one of the worst bosses in the game.
[4281.10s -> 4282.10s]  F?
[4282.10s -> 4283.46s]  Yeah, I agree.
[4283.46s -> 4284.46s]  I agree.
[4284.46s -> 4289.09s]  Oh no, F for frames.
[4289.09s -> 4291.14s]  Oh, come on.
[4291.14s -> 4292.26s]  Really?
[4292.26s -> 4308.11s]  I was just going so good for a while.
[4308.11s -> 4310.11s]  Why does Twitch hate my connection?
[4310.11s -> 4318.54s]  Why, Twitch, why do you hate my connection?
[4318.54s -> 4324.70s]  What did I do?
[4324.70s -> 4325.70s]  Write it out for a sec.
[4325.70s -> 4332.26s]  Are we alright?
[4332.26s -> 4339.78s]  I think we're okay.
[4339.78s -> 4343.98s]  I wish I had a solution.
[4343.98s -> 4344.98s]  If I open...
[4344.98s -> 4346.54s]  If I do a speed test right now, it'll be perfect.
[4346.54s -> 4348.29s]  I don't get it.
[4348.29s -> 4354.65s]  What?
[4354.65s -> 4355.65s]  Why is everybody Omega lowing?
[4355.65s -> 4362.95s]  What?
[4362.95s -> 4363.95s]  Why is everybody...
[4363.95s -> 4365.43s]  Why was there so many Omega lows?
[4365.43s -> 4370.13s]  There was a lot.
[4370.13s -> 4371.13s]  Is it the bitrate?
[4371.13s -> 4372.13s]  No, it's not...
[4372.13s -> 4373.43s]  The bit...
[4373.43s -> 4374.43s]  It's just...
[4374.43s -> 4375.43s]  I'm losing packets to Twitch.
[4377.17s -> 4378.65s]  The only service it's happening to.
[4378.65s -> 4383.31s]  And I think it's okay.
[4383.31s -> 4385.32s]  I don't know.
[4385.32s -> 4388.94s]  Alright, yeah, but I do agree with you though.
[4388.94s -> 4395.54s]  I think the one Reborn should be F, if not very close.
[4395.54s -> 4400.98s]  I'll put it at low D for now.
[4400.98s -> 4405.02s]  The music's gotta change as well here.
[4405.02s -> 4407.70s]  That was cool for a little bit, but let's get that off.
[4407.70s -> 4410.67s]  Something else.
[4410.67s -> 4412.67s]  Anything else you guys want to put up?
[4412.67s -> 4413.67s]  Any songs?
[4413.67s -> 4424.08s]  Why is everybody saying Omega low?
[4424.08s -> 4425.08s]  Firelink Shrine?
[4425.08s -> 4435.15s]  Yeah.
[4435.15s -> 4436.15s]  We'll do some Melodin Ring as well.
[4439.03s -> 4441.15s]  Okay, let's put that down.
[4441.15s -> 4443.77s]  Let's do some more refreshing, please.
[4443.77s -> 4448.65s]  I'd like if we could do some more refreshing.
[4448.65s -> 4450.05s]  Alright, that's the one Reborn.
[4450.05s -> 4451.05s]  Awful.
[4451.05s -> 4453.70s]  Let's do...
[4453.70s -> 4460.79s]  You already know these ones.
[4460.79s -> 4465.87s]  Blood Star Beast was not a flashy fight, but it was interesting at least.
[4465.87s -> 4468.38s]  It was hard.
[4468.38s -> 4472.02s]  You could make this fight really trivial if you have an item, and then the fight is essentially
[4472.02s -> 4481.84s]  a free boss kill.
[4481.84s -> 4482.84s]  You're making shit up?
[4482.84s -> 4484.66s]  What?
[4488.09s -> 4491.85s]  I'm not making shit up.
[4491.85s -> 4495.49s]  You throw one of those skulls into the wall and the Blood Star Beast just goes and attacks
[4495.49s -> 4498.49s]  it and you just get like a thousand damage for free.
[4498.49s -> 4500.05s]  Five thousand.
[4500.05s -> 4507.39s]  Alright, what about some other ones I need?
[4507.39s -> 4511.06s]  I liked Vicar Emilia's fight.
[4511.06s -> 4512.06s]  This was really cool.
[4512.06s -> 4514.26s]  Nobody tell him.
[4514.26s -> 4515.26s]  What?
[4515.26s -> 4520.46s]  What happened?
[4520.46s -> 4528.39s]  Why are you guys doing this to me?
[4528.39s -> 4532.93s]  What's going on?
[4532.93s -> 4533.93s]  I don't know.
[4533.93s -> 4534.93s]  I don't know.
[4534.93s -> 4536.70s]  Are they just trolling?
[4536.70s -> 4541.45s]  Yeah, this fight was really, really intense.
[4541.45s -> 4543.05s]  It was scary too.
[4547.89s -> 4549.25s]  Witches of Hemwick.
[4549.25s -> 4555.79s]  This is F. It's one of those just there's four or five of them just standing in corners
[4555.79s -> 4556.79s]  just kill them.
[4556.79s -> 4557.79s]  Yeah, this fight was awful.
[4557.79s -> 4567.29s]  Mm-hmm.
[4567.29s -> 4571.02s]  Okay.
[4571.02s -> 4574.31s]  Let me wait.
[4574.31s -> 4577.96s]  What else do we need a refresher on?
[4577.96s -> 4578.96s]  Shadows of Yharnam.
[4578.96s -> 4580.96s]  This fight was another just three enemies in the same room.
[4580.96s -> 4582.40s]  I did it with the snakes though, right?
[4582.40s -> 4586.24s]  This was actually pretty cool.
[4586.24s -> 4595.80s]  I don't know if this is going higher than like a B or a C, but I think it belongs somewhere.
[4595.80s -> 4598.13s]  It was easy.
[4598.13s -> 4606.62s]  I don't remember this being that easy.
[4606.62s -> 4613.95s]  I thought this was kind of a pain in the ass.
[4613.95s -> 4615.87s]  They turn into a snake.
[4615.87s -> 4616.87s]  That was really cool.
[4616.87s -> 4617.87s]  Did they show that part?
[4617.87s -> 4619.30s]  Yeah.
[4619.30s -> 4622.14s]  Right there.
[4622.14s -> 4625.23s]  Ah, this fight's cool.
[4625.23s -> 4630.89s]  I like it.
[4630.89s -> 4631.89s]  Who else do we need?
[4631.89s -> 4634.26s]  Rom was all right.
[4634.26s -> 4635.26s]  Rom was cool because of the area.
[4635.26s -> 4639.99s]  The fight was stupid.
[4639.99s -> 4648.14s]  Okay.
[4648.14s -> 4654.15s]  Rom did this really annoying thing where if Rom rolled, it did this kind of roll, roll
[4654.15s -> 4657.65s]  move where he would spin around and it killed you in one hit.
[4657.65s -> 4661.45s]  It was stupid.
[4661.45s -> 4664.86s]  Okay.
[4664.86s -> 4665.86s]  This fight was kind of disappointing.
[4665.86s -> 4671.94s]  The Amigdala fight, this was a disappointment for me.
[4671.94s -> 4676.11s]  I remember these are the things, like you're so scared of these things the entire game
[4676.11s -> 4678.59s]  and it's just kind of a boring fight.
[4678.59s -> 4683.99s]  It just shoots lasers.
[4683.99s -> 4686.87s]  This fight wasn't as scary as the enemy was hanging around.
[4686.87s -> 4693.02s]  Does it have the laser move?
[4693.02s -> 4696.88s]  Maybe that'll help.
[4696.88s -> 4700.10s]  Hmm.
[4700.10s -> 4701.41s]  Eh.
[4701.41s -> 4703.48s]  Eh.
[4703.48s -> 4706.19s]  It's all right.
[4706.19s -> 4712.46s]  You know that one, this is the electricity monster, which I'll give you a refresher.
[4712.46s -> 4714.66s]  By the way, if you haven't played any of these games, you probably shouldn't be watching
[4714.66s -> 4723.48s]  this stream because you're just getting spoiled on every single enemy.
[4723.48s -> 4724.66s]  This was okay too.
[4724.66s -> 4727.58s]  I wouldn't put it very high, but cool.
[4727.58s -> 4739.62s]  Okay.
[4739.62s -> 4740.62s]  Artir Lugarius.
[4740.62s -> 4744.69s]  Oh, this is the old guy.
[4744.69s -> 4745.99s]  Right.
[4745.99s -> 4747.71s]  This, I actually liked this fight.
[4747.71s -> 4753.62s]  Yep.
[4753.62s -> 4754.94s]  I actually liked this one a lot.
[4754.94s -> 4762.74s]  He was cool.
[4762.74s -> 4763.74s]  You cried here?
[4763.74s -> 4764.74s]  I didn't stream Bloodborne.
[4764.74s -> 4765.74s]  I played it on my own.
[4765.74s -> 4774.72s]  This is before I was a streamer.
[4774.72s -> 4776.20s]  It was a camera fight.
[4776.20s -> 4779.80s]  Yeah, he was rough, but I still feel like he was fun to play against.
[4781.41s -> 4783.54s]  Okay.
[4783.54s -> 4788.05s]  I'm going to turn off the fucking...
[4788.05s -> 4792.57s]  I feel like I am idling right now in Dark Souls.
[4792.57s -> 4798.82s]  I'm just sitting at the bonfire at the Firelink Shrine and it's driving me fucking crazy.
[4798.82s -> 4800.70s]  I feel like I want to alt tab and close the game.
[4800.70s -> 4805.69s]  We don't need a soundtrack for right now.
[4805.69s -> 4806.69s]  We're good.
[4806.69s -> 4809.54s]  We can change it when we need to.
[4809.54s -> 4810.54s]  Okay.
[4810.54s -> 4813.38s]  Let's keep going.
[4813.38s -> 4814.38s]  All right.
[4814.38s -> 4818.70s]  Well, we have our audio right here.
[4818.70s -> 4819.70s]  Celestial Emissary?
[4819.70s -> 4821.96s]  This is bad.
[4824.06s -> 4825.06s]  Fuck, man.
[4825.06s -> 4833.46s]  Is there a lot of Bloodborne bosses that are like D?
[4833.46s -> 4844.78s]  I might surprise myself a lot because this is absolutely like D or lower.
[4844.78s -> 4851.89s]  If you guys see me put the deacons higher than this, if they're not on the same line,
[4851.89s -> 4853.05s]  this whole list is wrong.
[4853.05s -> 4856.98s]  Yeah.
[4856.98s -> 4857.98s]  Okay.
[4857.98s -> 4859.66s]  That...
[4859.66s -> 4860.66s]  It's Ibritas, by the way.
[4860.66s -> 4861.86s]  You're wondering why I like it so much.
[4861.86s -> 4863.50s]  The thing is just so crazy looking and so cool.
[4863.50s -> 4867.37s]  Look at this thing.
[4867.37s -> 4868.37s]  It's so crazy.
[4868.37s -> 4869.67s]  Crazy!
[4869.67s -> 4876.29s]  And it goes like...
[4876.29s -> 4884.57s]  Okay.
[4884.73s -> 4885.73s]  Yeah.
[4885.73s -> 4887.74s]  Wait.
[4887.74s -> 4889.49s]  Hold on.
[4889.49s -> 4890.49s]  Here comes the music.
[4890.49s -> 4899.75s]  I want to hear the music one more time.
[4899.75s -> 4905.22s]  Here it comes.
[4905.22s -> 4906.22s]  Come on.
[4906.22s -> 4916.50s]  Here it comes.
[4916.50s -> 4928.62s]  Don't kill the boss before we hear it.
[4928.62s -> 4929.62s]  Come on.
[4929.62s -> 4935.41s]  I...
[4935.41s -> 4938.63s]  This game ran like shit.
[4938.63s -> 4939.63s]  Yeah, it did.
[4939.63s -> 4943.64s]  It's not even going to play the music.
[4943.64s -> 4947.44s]  Fuck it.
[4947.44s -> 4948.44s]  Whatever.
[4948.44s -> 4960.41s]  Micolash, this fight was an F, but his funny voice lines make it like a C. You chase him
[4960.41s -> 4971.94s]  around this mist area, and he goes like, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[4971.94s -> 4972.94s]  Yeah, this was...
[4972.94s -> 4975.78s]  I hated this.
[4975.78s -> 4979.34s]  Those of you who were asking if this changes, no, this is the whole fight.
[4979.34s -> 4984.05s]  You just follow this guy around a maze, and he laughs at you and says, yeah, this fight
[4984.05s -> 4992.67s]  is like a D. You can't put this higher than C because this is the fight.
[4992.67s -> 4995.20s]  You're watching the whole thing.
[4995.20s -> 4997.98s]  You just run behind this guy like a fucking recess.
[4997.98s -> 5000.79s]  You're like tag.
[5000.79s -> 5002.67s]  And sometimes shit just gets in the way.
[5002.67s -> 5006.28s]  No.
[5007.80s -> 5008.80s]  Look at how long this one is.
[5008.80s -> 5013.47s]  The longest one.
[5013.47s -> 5026.98s]  Ooh, Mergo's Wet Nurse was cool because the music was creepy.
[5026.98s -> 5031.30s]  I liked it.
[5031.30s -> 5037.23s]  That fight is F. Stop the blood-borne bias.
[5037.23s -> 5043.02s]  That's true.
[5043.02s -> 5044.02s]  This thing was creepy.
[5044.02s -> 5045.02s]  I liked it.
[5045.02s -> 5046.81s]  Okay, yeah, I know where that goes.
[5046.81s -> 5054.74s]  Undead Giant?
[5054.74s -> 5055.74s]  What is this fight?
[5055.74s -> 5060.18s]  I didn't do this one.
[5060.18s -> 5061.18s]  Merciless Chieftain?
[5061.18s -> 5064.34s]  Who is Merciless Chieftain?
[5064.34s -> 5070.43s]  Ah, these are from the Chalice Dungeons, okay.
[5070.43s -> 5075.67s]  I didn't do any of these.
[5075.67s -> 5078.07s]  Watchdog of the Old Lords, another Chalice Dungeon.
[5078.07s -> 5080.34s]  Eh.
[5080.34s -> 5082.75s]  Eh, I didn't play it.
[5082.75s -> 5084.92s]  Yeah, I didn't do it.
[5084.92s -> 5085.92s]  Eh.
[5085.92s -> 5086.92s]  Eh.
[5086.92s -> 5087.92s]  Eh.
[5087.92s -> 5088.92s]  Eh.
[5088.92s -> 5089.92s]  Eh.
[5089.92s -> 5090.92s]  No.
[5090.92s -> 5092.61s]  No.
[5092.61s -> 5095.00s]  No.
[5095.00s -> 5098.03s]  No?
[5098.03s -> 5101.47s]  I skipped over the Chalice Dungeons stuff.
[5101.47s -> 5111.22s]  It's kind of funny, they turned the Chalice Dungeons into the dungeons in Blood Elden Ring.
[5111.22s -> 5112.22s]  Very similar.
[5112.22s -> 5113.22s]  Almost the exact same setup.
[5113.22s -> 5115.03s]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[5117.82s -> 5120.48s]  Wow, I skipped almost all of this.
[5120.48s -> 5122.78s]  Alright, okay.
[5122.78s -> 5129.02s]  It's time for you to see the re- It's time for you to see.
[5129.02s -> 5133.77s]  This is the best boss that From Software has ever made.
[5133.77s -> 5143.20s]  Without a single doubt, by far.
[5143.20s -> 5155.89s]  Bloodborne also has the best DLC in many of the games as well.
[5155.89s -> 5156.89s]  Actual fake fan?
[5156.89s -> 5159.09s]  I did some of them, I just don't remember them.
[5159.09s -> 5164.94s]  So, if I remember, this boss is fucking dumb.
[5164.94s -> 5171.30s]  Boy, it's just like, you've given this, uh, in Dark Souls 1 bosses like this, in Demon
[5171.42s -> 5175.14s]  Souls bosses like this, you gave this like a B, like a C or a D.
[5175.14s -> 5176.44s]  I'm sorry.
[5176.44s -> 5179.44s]  You're gonna have to, you're gonna have to wait a second.
[5179.44s -> 5186.67s]  You're gonna have to wait a second.
[5186.67s -> 5193.57s]  Okay, now we'll watch.
[5193.57s -> 5195.26s]  Turn it up.
[5195.26s -> 5201.48s]  Wow, you're fighting this like beast and he's scary and he's fucked up.
[5201.48s -> 5203.16s]  Pretty cool.
[5203.16s -> 5204.44s]  What's happening?
[5204.44s -> 5205.44s]  What's going on here?
[5205.44s -> 5216.41s]  Shh.
[5216.41s -> 5239.75s]  Quiet, we're watching.
[5239.75s -> 5240.75s]  What's happening?
[5240.75s -> 5252.59s]  There he is.
[5254.72s -> 5256.72s]  Now the real fight begins.
[5256.72s -> 5276.66s]  Why, why, why, Bat Chest, what?
[5276.66s -> 5297.06s]  You guys are all haters and that's fine.
[5297.06s -> 5301.18s]  That's fine, you can be a hater, that's the best, this is the best encounter that From
[5301.18s -> 5306.14s]  Software has ever made and I'm gonna tell you, Horror Lou is close.
[5306.14s -> 5313.09s]  It's gonna be, I'm gonna need some Jeopardy music because, I don't know, that's the coolest
[5313.09s -> 5315.58s]  fight in the fucking entire game.
[5315.58s -> 5323.08s]  Not only in the whole game, in the whole franchises that they've ever had.
[5323.08s -> 5324.45s]  Bat Chest.
[5324.45s -> 5327.97s]  And I'll tell you, immediately following this boss is one of the worst bosses that
[5327.97s -> 5328.97s]  they put in the DLC.
[5328.97s -> 5333.92s]  Sorry, I just, hopefully I didn't hurt your ears.
[5333.92s -> 5339.00s]  Uh, Lawrence is just Cleric Beast on fire, we've seen them use this technique before.
[5339.00s -> 5344.24s]  And this fight was dumb.
[5344.24s -> 5348.01s]  Just Cleric Beast that is on fire.
[5348.01s -> 5355.60s]  We've seen them do this a few times.
[5355.60s -> 5361.09s]  There's a Ludwig Funko pop.
[5361.09s -> 5368.70s]  And I, you know, that sound, it's kind of overdone.
[5368.70s -> 5370.74s]  Living Failures, this is bad too.
[5370.74s -> 5378.47s]  This is the same fight from, yeah, this is really bad too.
[5378.47s -> 5383.66s]  I heckin' love Lud, yeah, I heckin' love Ludwig.
[5383.66s -> 5388.42s]  That's fine.
[5388.42s -> 5391.54s]  This is so bad.
[5391.54s -> 5396.54s]  It's so unfortunate because this area is one of the coolest DLC areas of any From Software
[5396.54s -> 5397.85s]  game.
[5397.85s -> 5405.23s]  But the boss at the end of it is dogshit.
[5405.23s -> 5411.00s]  Now we're getting into the Riddiel shit here.
[5411.00s -> 5412.00s]  Hard equals bad?
[5412.00s -> 5417.35s]  No, just putting like, just small enemies that just spawn over and over again, you know,
[5417.35s -> 5418.35s]  I don't know.
[5418.35s -> 5421.03s]  Just place around just enemies and kill them, like deacons.
[5421.03s -> 5428.39s]  I don't like the deacon fight either, I thought it was horrible.
[5428.39s -> 5429.71s]  This fight was crazy as well.
[5429.71s -> 5443.77s]  Not only that, this was a, I believe a three-phase fight.
[5443.77s -> 5456.52s]  Lady Maria was, I'm gonna say it, probably the, mmm, did you just say, did you say bootleg
[5456.52s -> 5459.94s]  millennia?
[5459.94s -> 5462.62s]  No, I'm sorry, this is actually a good encounter.
[5462.62s -> 5470.09s]  This is actually a really cool encounter and a really fun encounter.
[5470.09s -> 5472.71s]  This is high up there.
[5472.71s -> 5477.55s]  The only reason why I don't know if I want to put this at S is because the, it's, it's
[5477.55s -> 5484.60s]  just a long fight and the second, the second phase and third phase, whatever, um, it just
[5484.60s -> 5490.04s]  takes a long time to get there.
[5490.04s -> 5491.32s]  It's millennia with a gun.
[5491.32s -> 5493.13s]  Oh, it is not?
[5493.13s -> 5503.24s]  It's not bootleg millennia!
[5503.24s -> 5504.52s]  Maria came first!
[5504.52s -> 5513.30s]  Don't you understand?
[5513.30s -> 5516.78s]  Check this out.
[5516.78s -> 5518.86s]  Oh, no, no, no, now you fucked up.
[5518.86s -> 5525.28s]  Now you got to phase three.
[5525.28s -> 5527.68s]  What makes millennia bad other than that she's hard?
[5527.68s -> 5539.79s]  The waterfall dance is the stupidest move in any game they've ever made.
[5539.79s -> 5540.79s]  Just dodge it?
[5540.79s -> 5541.79s]  I don't care.
[5541.79s -> 5542.79s]  I don't care.
[5542.79s -> 5549.08s]  I don't like it.
[5549.08s -> 5550.08s]  Yeah.
[5550.08s -> 5551.08s]  This is now, this is a fight if I've ever seen one.
[5551.08s -> 5553.99s]  All right.
[5553.99s -> 5556.64s]  We all know where that is.
[5556.64s -> 5557.64s]  Orphan.
[5557.64s -> 5561.44s]  Oh yeah.
[5561.44s -> 5562.44s]  Orphan.
[5562.44s -> 5563.44s]  Orphan's design is, I don't know.
[5563.44s -> 5572.75s]  He kind of looks like one of the nobles in Elden Ring with like a big sack.
[5572.75s -> 5576.52s]  This fight was so hard, but he just screams.
[5576.52s -> 5591.43s]  Yeah, he just loves cartoons like Tom and Jerry screams.
[5591.43s -> 5599.24s]  I'm gonna put it at B. I don't think it's S.
[5604.70s -> 5605.70s]  Yeah.
[5618.23s -> 5619.23s]  That sounds like you.
[5620.40s -> 5621.40s]  No, it doesn't.
[5621.40s -> 5634.10s]  I'm not going to do this great.
[5634.10s -> 5635.10s]  All right.
[5635.10s -> 5639.92s]  We know what this is.
[5639.92s -> 5640.92s]  These are huge like spoilers, guys.
[5640.92s -> 5644.41s]  Like if you haven't played these games, what are you doing here?
[5644.41s -> 5647.38s]  Garamond's fight is awesome.
[5647.38s -> 5661.25s]  In fact, Garamond might actually be S. Garamond I think actually is S.
[5661.25s -> 5667.11s]  This fight felt, I remember, I remember when doing this and being like, yo, this is really,
[5667.11s -> 5668.61s]  this is really happening right now.
[5668.61s -> 5674.05s]  It was just like, holy shit.
[5674.05s -> 5675.65s]  I am playing Bloodborne right now.
[5675.65s -> 5676.65s]  This is happening.
[5676.65s -> 5687.30s]  Yeah.
[5687.30s -> 5688.30s]  This was so cool.
[5688.30s -> 5693.47s]  And then when he goes, I mean, my bitrate is probably awful right now, but the scythe
[5693.47s -> 5701.25s]  is, he's got a gun, play the cut scene.
[5701.25s -> 5703.56s]  I don't want to spoil the whole game.
[5703.56s -> 5704.56s]  There's tons of people that didn't play this.
[5704.56s -> 5705.56s]  It's only on PS4.
[5705.56s -> 5709.46s]  What a shame.
[5709.46s -> 5710.46s]  Okay.
[5710.46s -> 5712.38s]  So this is the actual major spoiler coming up.
[5712.38s -> 5715.66s]  I mean, like absolute true major spoiler.
[5715.66s -> 5720.10s]  This is like literally the final end of the whole game, like just to let you know.
[5721.28s -> 5730.35s]  The moon presence, which I thought was all right.
[5730.35s -> 5736.12s]  I didn't love it.
[5736.12s -> 5747.67s]  I can't say I particularly enjoyed this that much.
[5747.67s -> 5748.67s]  Cooler than Ludwig?
[5748.67s -> 5750.67s]  No, I don't think so.
[5750.67s -> 5762.75s]  It's ultra mid mega C. Yeah.
[5762.75s -> 5763.75s]  It's a lot.
[5763.75s -> 5765.31s]  That's a lot of this.
[5765.31s -> 5767.27s]  It's a big dash that moon presence does.
[5767.27s -> 5768.27s]  That's really annoying.
[5768.27s -> 5771.24s]  It's not Garamond.
[5771.24s -> 5772.24s]  All right.
[5772.24s -> 5774.95s]  I think I'm ready.
[5774.95s -> 5777.99s]  I believe I'm ready to do to place all the Bloodborne characters.
[5777.99s -> 5784.42s]  Some of these are going to shock you.
[5784.42s -> 5790.62s]  Some of these are going to shock you.
[5790.62s -> 5800.27s]  Blood Starved Beast is a C. Blood Starved Beast is better than Tibia Mariner.
[5800.27s -> 5803.66s]  I don't think it's better than the old hero or Nito.
[5803.66s -> 5811.73s]  Nito is the kind of C plus for me.
[5811.73s -> 5813.29s]  Micolash, Host of the Nightmare.
[5813.29s -> 5818.55s]  This is D. I mean, it's F. So let's go ahead and put it there the way that we're, we've
[5818.55s -> 5823.04s]  got to do this for real.
[5823.04s -> 5824.04s]  Characters cool.
[5824.04s -> 5827.50s]  The fight is just annoying.
[5827.50s -> 5830.70s]  It's voice lines are cool, but I'll look.
[5830.70s -> 5831.90s]  Is it better than the one reborn?
[5831.90s -> 5836.08s]  I don't think it is.
[5836.08s -> 5837.36s]  Is it better than Pinwheel?
[5837.36s -> 5840.62s]  Pinwheel actually probably should be here.
[5840.62s -> 5844.91s]  It's better than Pinwheel.
[5844.91s -> 5845.91s]  Is it though?
[5845.91s -> 5852.29s]  Because at least with Pinwheel you get Pinwheel over with very quickly.
[5852.29s -> 5854.17s]  Micolash takes a long time.
[5854.17s -> 5857.10s]  You just chase him around.
[5857.10s -> 5866.50s]  You get it over with.
[5866.50s -> 5870.53s]  Um, I cannot place Mergo's Wet Nurse yet.
[5870.53s -> 5871.57s]  I can place Amigdala.
[5871.57s -> 5882.06s]  This is a C. Martyr Lugarius is, I don't think it's A. I think it's B somewhere, but I'll
[5882.06s -> 5884.97s]  get it right.
[5884.97s -> 5892.26s]  Airman is A. I don't know if it...
[5892.26s -> 5895.62s]  Let me get it in the right spot before anybody freaks out.
[5895.62s -> 5903.60s]  Moon Presence, Super Ultra Omega C.
[5903.60s -> 5914.39s]  Living Failures, F. Are they better than, uh, no.
[5914.39s -> 5919.70s]  The Witches of Hemwick, this is a D. Although it maybe should, I don't know, how many Bloodborne
[5919.70s -> 5920.70s]  bosses are bad?
[5920.70s -> 5923.54s]  Alright, Lady Maria.
[5923.54s -> 5942.70s]  Lady Maria is coming up to A. Um, Lawrence, high D. Where's Cleric Beast?
[5942.70s -> 5945.50s]  They both, I mean they're both the same exact thing.
[5945.50s -> 5946.50s]  They're fine.
[5946.50s -> 5949.92s]  Orphan?
[5953.10s -> 5958.32s]  I don't know, I'm gonna be honest with you, the final boss of Bloodborne, being just kind
[5958.32s -> 5964.20s]  of like a naked guy screaming, it was like, I get it, I understand the lore, I understand,
[5964.20s -> 5965.95s]  I get it.
[5965.95s -> 5976.72s]  But I don't think it was, I don't think so.
[5976.72s -> 5987.19s]  I have to consciously put this higher than the Flame Lurk, than Gwyn.
[5987.19s -> 5992.77s]  I mean, was it, probably what, Gwyn maybe shouldn't be this high.
[5992.77s -> 5997.04s]  It's not, it's not better than Lugarius, I had more fun with Lugarius.
[5997.04s -> 6004.93s]  I'm gonna keep it there for now.
[6004.93s -> 6019.90s]  Something that's high, from C. Alright, Vicar Emilia, I'm gonna say B.
[6019.90s -> 6027.02s]  Celestial Emissary, somewhere down in F, or D, whatever, it's just, no.
[6027.02s -> 6031.92s]  Virgo's Wet Nurse, I'm gonna go low B for now.
[6031.92s -> 6044.39s]  Arl, C. Shadows of Yharnam, high C. I did not do these ones, so we're gonna put them here.
[6044.39s -> 6048.75s]  I know, dude, your favorite game, your favorite game is Bloodborne, and you have not done
[6048.75s -> 6052.30s]  any of these.
[6052.30s -> 6063.94s]  I didn't, none of them.
[6066.50s -> 6087.74s]  Okay, that's my favorite game ever made, and I didn't do any of these.
[6087.74s -> 6091.22s]  They were hidden deep in all these Chalice Dungeons, I just, I didn't really like the
[6091.22s -> 6095.27s]  Chalice Dungeons.
[6095.27s -> 6105.42s]  Okay, we are getting there, we're getting there.
[6105.42s -> 6112.26s]  Let's go ahead and get these out of the way, because all the Elden Ring ones are in memory.
[6112.26s -> 6118.52s]  So let's get the Bloodborne stuff in the right place, and then we'll do Elden Ring.
[6118.52s -> 6131.28s]  Alright, Father Gascoigne, A+, Rodrik, yep, Maria, I think that's fine where it is, although
[6131.28s -> 6132.28s]  I think they're better than these.
[6132.28s -> 6139.80s]  I gotta knock down Sif a little bit here.
[6139.80s -> 6144.39s]  Orphan, Legarius was cooler than all these.
[6144.39s -> 6148.88s]  What a great game.
[6148.88s -> 6158.31s]  Ah, alright, so Legarius, better than Ornstein and Smog, Koss was, I mean, Old King, I mean,
[6158.31s -> 6167.34s]  I don't know, Caping Dragon, better than that, Flamelurker.
[6167.34s -> 6168.82s]  Did you play the game?
[6168.82s -> 6170.86s]  That's one of my favorite games of all time!
[6170.86s -> 6184.42s]  Well, I didn't do the extra side dungeons, that doesn't matter.
[6184.42s -> 6190.14s]  Oh, guess what, I think Super Mario 64 is one of my favorite games.
[6190.14s -> 6193.38s]  I didn't ever get 120 stars, I got like 80!
[6193.38s -> 6200.69s]  Do I need to get everything?
[6200.69s -> 6204.71s]  You missed half the bosses, I didn't miss half the bosses!
[6204.71s -> 6209.07s]  Alright, I think this is fine where it is.
[6209.07s -> 6213.81s]  I actually don't think this is better than this.
[6213.81s -> 6218.79s]  I think Gascoigne was better than Garamond because, I don't know, I thought, Gascoigne
[6218.79s -> 6233.02s]  is like one of my favorite characters in that game, you're a fraud.
[6233.02s -> 6237.70s]  I didn't do any of this, the challenge dungeons were confusing, I just played the game.
[6237.70s -> 6239.30s]  I beat this game, okay.
[6239.30s -> 6245.42s]  I beat Bloodborne, god, like probably ten times, and I never did any of the Chalice
[6245.42s -> 6250.82s]  dungeons.
[6250.82s -> 6257.06s]  They were annoying, it was like, they were all the same, they were all the same, dungeon
[6257.06s -> 6264.98s]  just randomized, I didn't like it, I didn't want to do it.
[6264.98s -> 6266.73s]  But it's fine.
[6266.73s -> 6271.94s]  Okay.
[6271.94s -> 6272.94s]  Moon, okay.
[6272.94s -> 6277.59s]  Shadows of Yharnam, Wetners, I think this is fine up here.
[6277.59s -> 6284.36s]  Blood Starve Beast, definitely not cooler than the Tibia Mariner, or definitely better
[6284.36s -> 6290.32s]  than the Valgar Goyles, because like, those things are stupid.
[6290.32s -> 6291.32s]  Horus Demon as well.
[6291.32s -> 6302.77s]  A lot of Cs all in a row here.
[6302.77s -> 6306.17s]  I think Omigdala is better than, I don't think it's cooler than Seath.
[6306.17s -> 6308.98s]  At least Seath looked kind of weird.
[6308.98s -> 6310.62s]  Moon Presence was probably better than this.
[6310.62s -> 6312.56s]  Yeah, these all have to come up.
[6312.56s -> 6322.55s]  Like, Penetrator is just a guy with a sword, it's not like a huge deal.
[6322.55s -> 6340.34s]  Hmm, these are F.
[6340.34s -> 6344.26s]  Micolash is probably the worst of the four, just because I just, chasing him around was
[6344.26s -> 6346.14s]  annoying.
[6346.14s -> 6348.82s]  Why the fuck is the Tibia Mariner above the Moon Presence?
[6348.86s -> 6350.58s]  I'm working on this, okay?
[6350.58s -> 6353.20s]  This is, I'm working on it.
[6353.20s -> 6354.20s]  I need to make sure.
[6354.20s -> 6357.95s]  There's a lot of creatures here.
[6357.95s -> 6363.82s]  The Tibia Mariner is cooler.
[6363.82s -> 6364.94s]  I think so.
[6364.94s -> 6374.34s]  I think the Tibia Mariner is cooler than the Moonlight Butterfly.
[6374.34s -> 6380.29s]  The Moon Presence is just, yeah, the Moon Presence is cooler than the, yeah, that's
[6380.29s -> 6382.04s]  true.
[6382.04s -> 6383.04s]  Yeah.
[6383.04s -> 6384.04s]  I don't think, I think this is the wall.
[6384.04s -> 6385.98s]  This is the wall.
[6385.98s -> 6390.98s]  To graduate to C+, you have to be cooler than the Tibia Mariner, which seems like apparently
[6390.98s -> 6392.30s]  a pretty big feat.
[6392.30s -> 6395.90s]  This is the wall.
[6395.90s -> 6397.78s]  You have to be cooler than the Tibia Mariner.
[6397.78s -> 6405.17s]  Or, excuse me, you're not getting any exclusive C++.
[6405.17s -> 6411.43s]  Is the Moon Presence cooler than the Tibia Mariner?
[6411.43s -> 6413.63s]  Fight-wise, mechanics-wise, looks-wise?
[6413.63s -> 6420.06s]  No.
[6420.06s -> 6429.00s]  Are any of these motherfuckers cooler than the Tibia Mariner?
[6429.00s -> 6435.54s]  Shit, somebody might be, hold on.
[6435.54s -> 6437.77s]  I gotta make sure I get this right.
[6437.77s -> 6440.21s]  Rom might be cooler than the Tibia Mariner.
[6440.21s -> 6449.65s]  Do you know what I mean?
[6449.69s -> 6455.87s]  I think we, I think Rom graduates.
[6455.87s -> 6460.58s]  Quelaag might be cooler than the Tibia Mariner.
[6460.58s -> 6465.70s]  Absolutely no way the Taurus Demon, Bell Gargoyle, Butterfly, Seath is definitely cooler than
[6465.70s -> 6472.38s]  all these though.
[6472.38s -> 6475.78s]  Alright, very important.
[6475.78s -> 6484.90s]  Is Seath the Scaleless cooler than the Tibia Mariner?
[6484.90s -> 6488.50s]  Yes.
[6488.50s -> 6494.58s]  Alright, I think we're good.
[6494.58s -> 6496.08s]  One Reborn at least is a fight.
[6496.08s -> 6500.94s]  This is going up here, Pat, I mean, this is just, there's stuff that I don't want to put
[6500.94s -> 6504.46s]  in F because I don't want to have F be crowded, because I want to at least pretend like I
[6504.46s -> 6506.07s]  like these games.
[6506.07s -> 6514.58s]  So I can't just put all these things in F. I don't think this belongs down here.
[6514.58s -> 6520.60s]  This is definitely cooler than this.
[6520.60s -> 6523.71s]  Capra Deep, what's the worst thing?
[6523.71s -> 6526.21s]  Dirty Colossus is not the worst thing.
[6526.21s -> 6531.59s]  Dead of Chaos is probably the worst.
[6531.59s -> 6537.37s]  And I gotta be honest, so is the Celestial Emissary is not even a boss fight.
[6537.37s -> 6545.42s]  You fight like three dozen of those little like bug alien people and then it ends.
[6545.42s -> 6554.43s]  This actually could be the worst.
[6554.43s -> 6557.47s]  Dirty Colossus is just, it's not bad, it's just boring.
[6558.80s -> 6560.24s]  Living Failures belongs down here too.
[6560.24s -> 6562.24s]  I didn't like these at all, they were terrible.
[6562.24s -> 6589.81s]  I'm trying to get it right.
[6589.81s -> 6599.58s]  Capra Demon is probably the coolest out of all of these.
[6599.58s -> 6602.66s]  I think this is accurate.
[6602.66s -> 6603.78s]  I think I got it.
[6603.78s -> 6608.82s]  Dirty Colossus should be in, no, not F, right?
[6608.82s -> 6616.72s]  If I'm going to put Dirty Colossus in F, then all the Asylum Demons have to be in F.
[6616.72s -> 6620.68s]  Same thing with the Maneater.
[6620.68s -> 6626.32s]  Dirty Colossus is going up and so is Maneater.
[6626.32s -> 6635.94s]  And we're going to bring all these Asylum Demons down.
[6635.94s -> 6637.66s]  This is looking a lot better.
[6637.66s -> 6644.80s]  Way better than it was before.
[6644.80s -> 6646.88s]  Centipede Demon is definitely cooler than this.
[6646.88s -> 6650.90s]  Just put the two bugs next to each other, who cares?
[6650.90s -> 6652.34s]  Iron Golem is going down here too.
[6652.34s -> 6653.34s]  Who cares?
[6653.34s -> 6659.47s]  You're at least a fight, this goes here.
[6659.47s -> 6662.88s]  You're at least a fight, you go there.
[6662.88s -> 6663.88s]  This is hard.
[6663.88s -> 6673.89s]  I think I'm good for Bloodborne.
[6673.89s -> 6676.81s]  I don't know if I want to put any of these at S.
[6676.81s -> 6680.45s]  I have to reliably say that was one of the coolest, that was awesome.
[6680.45s -> 6681.45s]  That was unbelievable.
[6681.45s -> 6699.57s]  I'm going to leave it for now.
[6699.57s -> 6703.27s]  I think I like Godric more than Maria.
[6703.31s -> 6708.37s]  I like Godric more than Gascoigne.
[6708.37s -> 6709.37s]  Oh shit, no I don't.
[6709.37s -> 6710.37s]  That's recency bias.
[6710.37s -> 6716.33s]  Alright, let's do Elden Ring, because I can do these quick.
[6716.33s -> 6720.10s]  Elden Ring, I can do it really quick.
[6720.10s -> 6722.81s]  Here we go.
[6722.81s -> 6723.81s]  Uh, Mog.
[6723.81s -> 6728.54s]  We just did it, I don't need any refreshers.
[6728.54s -> 6736.73s]  Mog is going to be up at C, or B, for now.
[6736.73s -> 6742.69s]  Probably here.
[6742.69s -> 6745.49s]  Wait, is Mog cooler than the Tibia Mariner?
[6745.49s -> 6752.27s]  Yes, absolutely.
[6752.27s -> 6756.83s]  Mimic Tear, it's a comedy boss, so it's just going in D.
[6756.87s -> 6761.49s]  I don't think it's F, it means it's close.
[6761.49s -> 6770.03s]  Also, Rikard, okay, Rikard was a gimmick fight, but was a really cool design boss, it's going
[6770.03s -> 6772.04s]  to go B.
[6772.04s -> 6773.04s]  Do we need some music or something?
[6773.04s -> 6778.58s]  Uh, yeah, we can put something on.
[6778.58s -> 6780.78s]  D, I'm just getting him in the general area.
[6780.78s -> 6784.27s]  This is not, we're not done completely, hold on.
[6784.27s -> 6787.43s]  It's got to be in the general area.
[6787.43s -> 6788.55s]  I can hear myself breathing.
[6788.55s -> 6789.55s]  I'm working on it.
[6789.55s -> 6801.05s]  How about, um, it's a good OST.
[6801.05s -> 6802.05s]  Bugsnax?
[6802.05s -> 6805.53s]  No, it doesn't fit.
[6805.53s -> 6806.53s]  Mario 64, yeah sure.
[6806.53s -> 6809.05s]  No, that doesn't fit either.
[6809.05s -> 6813.25s]  That's going to annoy me, I know it will.
[6813.25s -> 6815.13s]  Halo?
[6815.13s -> 6822.38s]  Hmm, Hollow Knight.
[6822.38s -> 6823.38s]  Yeah, that sounds fun.
[6823.38s -> 6836.08s]  Okay, because we're not watching any Elden Ring stuff.
[6836.08s -> 6845.06s]  There you go, now we can not freak out.
[6845.06s -> 6850.66s]  So, uh, Godskin Noble, that's the fat one, right, or is that the skinny one?
[6850.66s -> 6860.59s]  Fat?
[6860.59s -> 6861.59s]  I actually like that a lot.
[6861.59s -> 6862.90s]  That was a cool fight.
[6862.90s -> 6865.90s]  But, I don't know, I kind of, they used it too much.
[6865.90s -> 6872.02s]  Don't you feel like it was kind of used a little too much?
[6872.02s -> 6878.82s]  I'm going to put it down to C just because I feel like they used this too much.
[6878.82s -> 6880.98s]  This character appears in the game like four times.
[6880.98s -> 6884.52s]  Three times?
[6884.52s -> 6887.52s]  Yeah, but I mean, it's like, I don't know, I feel like there wasn't too many places.
[6887.52s -> 6895.25s]  I'm going to keep it here for now.
[6895.25s -> 6901.74s]  Um, actually, I could probably do some of the Sekiro ones too, get off of memory.
[6901.74s -> 6907.45s]  Alright, we got Elder Dragon Grail.
[6907.45s -> 6911.39s]  This is the one that you just put a bleed weapon on and kill it, right?
[6911.39s -> 6912.55s]  It doesn't really attack back?
[6912.55s -> 6915.75s]  I mean, is this really a boss?
[6916.35s -> 6927.45s]  Or is this just kind of like a set piece that dies?
[6927.45s -> 6928.45s]  Eh, eh.
[6928.45s -> 6930.07s]  Yeah.
[6930.07s -> 6931.76s]  It's F.
[6931.76s -> 6934.36s]  F, but no, I don't think it deserves to be an F.
[6934.36s -> 6937.71s]  Or Dan?
[6937.71s -> 6944.38s]  F?
[6944.38s -> 6948.47s]  Uh, Regal Ancestor Spirit, I like that a lot.
[6948.47s -> 6949.47s]  That was a lot of fun.
[6949.47s -> 6954.00s]  It's going to be for now.
[6954.00s -> 6960.29s]  Uh, we've got the gargoyles, which I feel like I would have been kind of, I'm going
[6960.29s -> 6962.46s]  to make a statement here.
[6962.46s -> 6967.06s]  All the, it's two enemies in the same room boss.
[6967.06s -> 6971.31s]  Those are all at least a C or lower.
[6971.31s -> 6972.55s]  They just are.
[6972.55s -> 6978.33s]  Like, we just put two in the room.
[6978.33s -> 6980.21s]  Eh.
[6980.21s -> 6987.14s]  Uh, Dragonkin Soldier of Noxtela, did I do this?
[6987.14s -> 6989.14s]  Oh, and these are the dragon soldiers.
[6989.14s -> 6994.27s]  They kind of overused these two, but they were interesting.
[6994.27s -> 6998.26s]  C.
[6998.26s -> 6999.26s]  B is champions.
[6999.26s -> 7008.63s]  These were bad.
[7008.63s -> 7014.33s]  Alright, this is, this is the Godfrey Shade, which is probably somewhere in the high sea.
[7014.33s -> 7015.33s]  Maybe not.
[7015.33s -> 7020.00s]  I got to, that's going to take a lot of looking.
[7020.00s -> 7024.97s]  Okay, Astel, Natural Born of the Void, this, I liked this one a lot.
[7024.97s -> 7026.97s]  Astel's going up to at least high B.
[7026.97s -> 7027.97s]  We'll, we'll sort it.
[7027.97s -> 7029.91s]  We'll sort it.
[7029.91s -> 7033.91s]  Some of these have to get, you have to graduate these to A, you don't just put it in A, unless
[7033.91s -> 7036.37s]  you're certain.
[7036.37s -> 7037.61s]  Margit.
[7037.61s -> 7042.04s]  Margit and Morgoth are going to be next to each other, because they're the same person.
[7042.04s -> 7045.30s]  If one fights, it's a lot harder.
[7045.30s -> 7052.62s]  Margit.
[7052.62s -> 7053.62s]  It wasn't that, it was alright, it was okay.
[7053.62s -> 7061.48s]  I think it's like a B.
[7061.48s -> 7063.91s]  And Morgoth, it's kind of unfortunate.
[7063.91s -> 7066.47s]  I'm going to have to put this down here.
[7066.47s -> 7069.47s]  Morgoth goes down and I don't know, because I didn't kill him.
[7069.47s -> 7073.71s]  I summoned the Mimic Tear before the nerf and it killed him in less than 15 seconds.
[7073.71s -> 7075.71s]  I don't even know what that guy does.
[7075.71s -> 7079.21s]  I have no idea what Morgoth's moves are.
[7079.21s -> 7081.21s]  Mimic Tear killed him in 10 seconds.
[7081.21s -> 7085.77s]  And it was at that moment that I said, I'm not going to use the Mimic Tear again, unless
[7085.77s -> 7087.58s]  I need to.
[7087.58s -> 7091.58s]  I got one attempt in, but I didn't really even fight this boss.
[7091.58s -> 7098.97s]  Commander Nihil.
[7098.97s -> 7109.82s]  Commander Nihil was the one with the summons, with the electronic lightning prosthetic,
[7109.82s -> 7112.98s]  right?
[7112.98s -> 7117.49s]  I don't know.
[7117.49s -> 7118.49s]  Bulled and Margit?
[7118.49s -> 7120.24s]  Maybe.
[7120.24s -> 7123.24s]  But the Ancestral Spirit I thought was a really cool fight.
[7123.24s -> 7124.54s]  It'll be here for now.
[7124.54s -> 7126.62s]  Why is Rodan so low?
[7126.62s -> 7127.62s]  I hated that fight.
[7127.62s -> 7128.62s]  It was stupid.
[7128.62s -> 7130.75s]  I don't like it.
[7130.75s -> 7131.75s]  I don't like it at all.
[7131.75s -> 7132.75s]  It was one of the worst.
[7132.75s -> 7137.53s]  This one was cool too, but then they started using this as a regular enemy and it kind
[7137.53s -> 7140.15s]  of took the magic away from me.
[7140.15s -> 7143.99s]  But I would say at least like a B-.
[7143.99s -> 7148.18s]  Borey.
[7148.18s -> 7149.18s]  Okay, these are dragons.
[7149.18s -> 7150.18s]  We'll leave the dragons for now.
[7150.18s -> 7151.18s]  Fire Giant.
[7151.18s -> 7156.66s]  I would have loved to have been able to see the Fire Giant, but it actually was a pretty
[7156.66s -> 7157.66s]  cool fight.
[7157.66s -> 7159.66s]  Especially the cutscene and then the second phase.
[7159.66s -> 7162.92s]  It's going to stay here for now.
[7162.92s -> 7164.42s]  Hard equals bad.
[7164.42s -> 7167.49s]  Wait, when did they say that?
[7167.49s -> 7172.25s]  What are you talking about?
[7172.25s -> 7177.90s]  All right, which one of these down here is hard?
[7177.90s -> 7178.90s]  Let me tell you.
[7178.90s -> 7183.44s]  This fight you can kill in one hit if you really want to.
[7183.44s -> 7184.44s]  This is not hard.
[7184.44s -> 7185.81s]  This is not hard.
[7185.81s -> 7186.81s]  This is a gimmick.
[7186.81s -> 7187.81s]  This is a gimmick.
[7187.81s -> 7188.81s]  This is a gimmick.
[7188.81s -> 7189.81s]  This is a gimmick.
[7189.81s -> 7190.81s]  This is a gimmick.
[7190.81s -> 7191.81s]  This is a gimmick.
[7191.81s -> 7193.50s]  This is a gimmick.
[7193.50s -> 7194.50s]  This is a gimmick.
[7194.50s -> 7195.50s]  This is a gimmick.
[7195.50s -> 7196.50s]  This is a gimmick.
[7196.50s -> 7199.06s]  These are tutorial fights.
[7199.06s -> 7201.74s]  And this is a gimmick.
[7201.74s -> 7202.74s]  How are these hard?
[7202.74s -> 7205.75s]  Oh, you're talking specifically to Rodan.
[7205.75s -> 7211.92s]  Rodan is staying at F. Rodan, that's not a hard fight.
[7211.92s -> 7220.62s]  It's a dumb fight.
[7220.62s -> 7225.36s]  And that was pre-nerf, which was even worse.
[7225.36s -> 7233.36s]  And let's make everybody angry just because they'll get out of the way.
[7233.36s -> 7234.36s]  Mog, Lord of Blood.
[7234.36s -> 7235.36s]  Wait, didn't I already put Mog?
[7235.36s -> 7239.10s]  Where's Mog?
[7239.10s -> 7248.46s]  Didn't I put Mog?
[7248.46s -> 7252.33s]  Mog?
[7252.33s -> 7253.33s]  Mog the Omen.
[7253.33s -> 7254.63s]  Mog.
[7254.63s -> 7255.63s]  All right, well, whatever.
[7255.63s -> 7256.63s]  It's the same thing.
[7256.63s -> 7259.38s]  We never fought the other one.
[7259.38s -> 7261.26s]  Oh, whatever.
[7261.26s -> 7263.26s]  It's just in the same place then.
[7263.26s -> 7266.74s]  Gold skin duo.
[7266.74s -> 7270.11s]  I mean, all right.
[7270.11s -> 7272.76s]  C-.
[7272.76s -> 7277.41s]  Dragon Lord, Placidusix.
[7277.41s -> 7280.86s]  Dragon Lord, Placidusix is very high.
[7280.86s -> 7287.94s]  I think we've got our first A, at least, besides Godric.
[7287.94s -> 7291.93s]  Yeah.
[7291.93s -> 7294.17s]  Dragon Lord and Godric are pretty close.
[7294.17s -> 7295.17s]  I think Dragon Lord is cooler, though.
[7295.17s -> 7298.11s]  Dragon Lord is cooler than Gaspine.
[7298.11s -> 7315.71s]  I have to be fair.
[7315.71s -> 7322.58s]  Nope.
[7322.58s -> 7323.58s]  Rinala.
[7323.58s -> 7331.22s]  Rinala was like C, C-plus, maybe.
[7331.22s -> 7333.46s]  Better than that.
[7333.46s -> 7341.72s]  It was just kind of the magic spam fight, right?
[7341.72s -> 7342.72s]  All right.
[7342.72s -> 7346.46s]  Malekith.
[7346.46s -> 7349.76s]  Malekith was not, I don't know.
[7349.76s -> 7352.32s]  I feel like, did I have a lot of complaints about Malekith?
[7352.32s -> 7356.29s]  I think I did.
[7356.29s -> 7357.29s]  I love that clergyman.
[7357.29s -> 7358.29s]  I love that beast clergyman.
[7358.29s -> 7359.29s]  Really cool design.
[7359.29s -> 7361.29s]  We're going to use that part.
[7361.29s -> 7369.54s]  Design-wise, really cool.
[7369.54s -> 7373.70s]  I think it's a good spot for it for now.
[7373.70s -> 7374.70s]  Oh, Gideon.
[7374.70s -> 7380.95s]  I'll be all knowing, of course.
[7380.95s -> 7383.20s]  D.
[7383.20s -> 7384.20s]  Maybe D-plus.
[7384.20s -> 7392.33s]  That's better than the Four Kings.
[7392.33s -> 7393.33s]  Leone, Misbegotten.
[7393.33s -> 7398.08s]  These are the kind of lion, wolf, people with the sword.
[7398.08s -> 7401.11s]  They weren't bad.
[7401.11s -> 7403.11s]  They were, I mean, they were used a lot.
[7403.11s -> 7405.11s]  Kind of like, I would put it in the same categories.
[7405.11s -> 7409.11s]  I'm going to put high C, low B.
[7409.11s -> 7414.54s]  The bosses that they just kind of made regular enemies like five times.
[7414.54s -> 7418.90s]  I think that is fair.
[7418.90s -> 7423.46s]  These might come down.
[7423.46s -> 7428.90s]  Gideon deserves better.
[7428.90s -> 7429.90s]  We'll see.
[7429.90s -> 7430.90s]  Hold on.
[7430.90s -> 7434.17s]  It's above comparing to the other games.
[7434.17s -> 7435.17s]  Loretta?
[7435.17s -> 7438.82s]  This is going to surprise a lot of you guys.
[7438.82s -> 7448.29s]  I may have just gotten like 10 unsubscriptions in a row.
[7448.29s -> 7449.29s]  I really liked that fight.
[7449.29s -> 7450.29s]  I thought it was really cool.
[7450.29s -> 7458.33s]  That fight didn't feel annoying.
[7458.33s -> 7460.95s]  It was kind of challenging.
[7460.95s -> 7462.95s]  The dodging the magic and the spear with the horse.
[7462.95s -> 7463.95s]  You can't get on the horse.
[7463.95s -> 7465.45s]  I liked it a lot.
[7465.45s -> 7472.81s]  What music is playing?
[7472.81s -> 7474.69s]  Don't tell me what this is.
[7474.69s -> 7475.69s]  I forgot what the OST is.
[7475.69s -> 7482.50s]  Don't tell me.
[7482.50s -> 7488.09s]  Hollow Knight.
[7488.09s -> 7495.73s]  Um, we got Ancient Hero of Zamor.
[7495.73s -> 7499.82s]  Oh, some of these are the jail.
[7499.82s -> 7500.82s]  Deathbird.
[7500.82s -> 7501.82s]  Oh yeah, I remember that.
[7501.82s -> 7502.82s]  I hated that.
[7502.82s -> 7505.58s]  Soldier of Godric?
[7505.58s -> 7506.58s]  Just a regular enemy?
[7506.58s -> 7512.44s]  Why is it Soldier of Godric?
[7512.44s -> 7518.74s]  Deathbird.
[7518.74s -> 7522.00s]  Put the death magic on the ground.
[7522.00s -> 7523.00s]  This is a D.
[7523.00s -> 7529.94s]  Melania.
[7529.94s -> 7531.94s]  Blade of Micola.
[7531.94s -> 7539.28s]  Worse than Soldier of Godric.
[7539.28s -> 7541.28s]  Radagon and Eldenbeast together.
[7541.28s -> 7545.03s]  This is a mid-C.
[7545.03s -> 7547.36s]  Gave you my reasoning.
[7547.36s -> 7554.08s]  Oh, Scream is dying again.
[7554.08s -> 7558.20s]  Interesting.
[7558.20s -> 7561.10s]  Very interesting.
[7561.10s -> 7564.65s]  I don't get it.
[7564.65s -> 7566.59s]  That makes sense.
[7566.59s -> 7572.93s]  Like, um, I don't get it.
[7572.93s -> 7579.33s]  My internet's fine.
[7579.33s -> 7667.40s]  Why?
[7667.40s -> 7668.40s]  So as I was saying.
[7668.40s -> 7674.50s]  I just like almost swallowed it and choked.
[7674.50s -> 7676.50s]  Melania is F.
[7676.50s -> 7683.10s]  This reminds me of the Cox days.
[7683.10s -> 7684.10s]  Here's the thing though.
[7684.10s -> 7689.10s]  If I run a speed test right now, it'll be 1,000, 1,000.
[7689.10s -> 7700.23s]  I could go watch like a 4K movie while the stream is dying.
[7700.23s -> 7701.23s]  It's not my internet.
[7701.23s -> 7703.23s]  It's not, it's not the internet.
[7703.23s -> 7707.23s]  It's some, the connection that this internet.
[7707.23s -> 7709.23s]  But I have two Twitch's servers.
[7709.23s -> 7711.60s]  Sometimes it just gets fucked.
[7711.60s -> 7712.60s]  Just gets fucked up.
[7712.60s -> 7719.23s]  While that was happening, I, I did a test.
[7719.23s -> 7721.23s]  While that was happening.
[7721.23s -> 7723.23s]  Not a single solitary problem.
[7723.23s -> 7726.23s]  When it was happening during the Fortnite tournament thing.
[7726.23s -> 7727.23s]  I was in the call.
[7727.23s -> 7730.23s]  And they were, I had green bars on Discord.
[7730.23s -> 7731.23s]  Everything was normal.
[7731.23s -> 7732.60s]  I don't get it.
[7732.60s -> 7735.95s]  Doesn't make any sense.
[7735.95s -> 7742.10s]  Speed test does not equal stability.
[7742.10s -> 7745.10s]  Well, then I should have dropped out of the Discord call.
[7745.10s -> 7749.85s]  I looked over here and I went, I went to zero a couple of times during that Fortnite tournament.
[7749.85s -> 7750.85s]  And it was green bar.
[7750.85s -> 7753.85s]  Perfect connection on Discord and to Fortnite.
[7753.85s -> 7754.85s]  I didn't get kicked out of Fortnite.
[7754.85s -> 7755.85s]  I was in it the whole time.
[7755.85s -> 7760.03s]  You know what I mean?
[7760.03s -> 7766.98s]  The routing issue between the ISP and Twitch.
[7766.98s -> 7775.29s]  It has to be.
[7775.29s -> 7777.29s]  There's nothing, there's like nothing I can really do.
[7777.29s -> 7779.46s]  The only thing I can do is I can contact Twitch.
[7779.46s -> 7780.46s]  And just be like.
[7780.46s -> 7781.64s]  Yo.
[7781.64s -> 7782.64s]  Um.
[7782.64s -> 7783.64s]  What's happening?
[7783.64s -> 7784.64s]  Like what?
[7784.64s -> 7787.64s]  Can you look at my connection and see like what's going on?
[7787.64s -> 7790.90s]  Because on my end, nothing is wrong.
[7790.90s -> 7793.90s]  But before, when I used to have internet problems all the time.
[7793.90s -> 7795.90s]  That was a me problem.
[7795.90s -> 7796.90s]  That was like.
[7796.90s -> 7798.90s]  I was dropping packets.
[7798.90s -> 7800.90s]  My internet browser wouldn't even open.
[7800.90s -> 7806.40s]  The speed test would be like 0.5 up and like 0.2 down.
[7806.40s -> 7809.41s]  So it's not this time.
[7809.41s -> 7810.41s]  It's not the internet this time.
[7810.41s -> 7812.41s]  It's something to do with the routing to Twitch.
[7812.41s -> 7814.16s]  Who knows?
[7814.16s -> 7816.81s]  Anyways.
[7816.81s -> 7818.81s]  That was a.
[7818.81s -> 7819.81s]  I don't think Millenia.
[7819.81s -> 7821.81s]  Obviously let's be, I'll be fair.
[7821.81s -> 7826.07s]  Millenia I think was somewhere up here.
[7826.07s -> 7830.49s]  Hard equals bad.
[7830.49s -> 7839.32s]  Yes, hard equals bad.
[7839.32s -> 7842.32s]  Some of these were just kind of the little mini bosses, which I don't know if they should be on here.
[7842.32s -> 7845.01s]  Magma worm was kind of cool.
[7845.01s -> 7856.98s]  I actually liked that fight.
[7856.98s -> 7859.30s]  I'll stick with this for now.
[7859.30s -> 7865.34s]  For now.
[7865.34s -> 7867.34s]  Ancestor Spirit and Regal Ancestor Spirit.
[7867.34s -> 7870.10s]  I'm going to put the same spot.
[7870.10s -> 7872.10s]  Kind of the same fight.
[7872.10s -> 7883.14s]  But the Regal one was upgraded a little bit.
[7883.14s -> 7886.62s]  Where is it?
[7886.62s -> 7887.93s]  Right here.
[7887.93s -> 7888.93s]  A Ulcerated Tree Spirit.
[7888.93s -> 7889.93s]  They used this a lot.
[7889.93s -> 7891.93s]  It was cool the first few times.
[7891.93s -> 7892.93s]  It's not going to be F.
[7892.93s -> 7897.09s]  It's going to be like C.
[7897.09s -> 7903.49s]  Somewhere around with the dragonkin there.
[7903.49s -> 7904.49s]  Regal had the big heal.
[7904.49s -> 7906.62s]  That was fine.
[7906.62s -> 7909.95s]  You should put Radan higher.
[7909.95s -> 7915.10s]  I probably will.
[7915.10s -> 7916.72s]  Alright.
[7916.72s -> 7918.72s]  The Tree Sentinel was...
[7918.72s -> 7920.72s]  I know they did it a few times, right?
[7920.72s -> 7922.86s]  But.
[7922.86s -> 7925.50s]  That fight was really cool.
[7925.50s -> 7928.50s]  Because the first time you see the Tree Sentinel.
[7928.50s -> 7929.50s]  It's almost like, holy shit.
[7929.50s -> 7931.50s]  There's a boss right there.
[7931.50s -> 7940.57s]  And that's the first time you have to do any horseback fighting if you wanted to.
[7940.57s -> 7942.57s]  And it was really intense.
[7942.57s -> 7949.12s]  I like it there for now.
[7949.12s -> 7953.22s]  We'll see in a minute.
[7953.22s -> 7954.22s]  Hatches.
[7954.22s -> 7957.12s]  Eh.
[7957.12s -> 7962.54s]  I wouldn't really call this a boss fight as much as an NPC encounter.
[7962.54s -> 7963.54s]  But whatever.
[7963.54s -> 7971.82s]  I'm going to make a new category here.
[7971.82s -> 7972.82s]  For mini bosses.
[7972.82s -> 7975.70s]  I don't think it should be on here.
[7975.70s -> 7977.94s]  I'm going to make a category for mini bosses.
[7977.94s -> 7981.69s]  And that's it's own category.
[7981.69s -> 7982.69s]  Yeah.
[7982.69s -> 7987.51s]  That's a good idea.
[7987.51s -> 7988.51s]  Mini boss.
[7988.51s -> 7996.28s]  That's better.
[7996.28s -> 8000.06s]  Okay.
[8000.06s -> 8002.14s]  So.
[8002.14s -> 8003.14s]  Mini bosses.
[8003.14s -> 8004.14s]  Because these are going to just...
[8004.14s -> 8005.14s]  It's going to get all gummed up.
[8005.14s -> 8006.63s]  It is.
[8006.63s -> 8007.63s]  This just doesn't belong here.
[8007.63s -> 8008.63s]  Right?
[8008.63s -> 8009.63s]  This is going to get all gummed up.
[8009.63s -> 8010.63s]  And I don't want it to.
[8010.63s -> 8011.63s]  Tree Spirit.
[8011.63s -> 8012.63s]  That was a mini boss.
[8012.63s -> 8013.63s]  Technically.
[8013.63s -> 8014.63s]  It's going to get all gummed up.
[8014.63s -> 8018.75s]  Who else is a mini boss?
[8018.75s -> 8025.28s]  Tibia Mariner belongs down there.
[8025.28s -> 8028.28s]  Tibia Mariner I don't think deserves to be down there.
[8028.28s -> 8036.43s]  Hmm.
[8036.43s -> 8043.26s]  I mean very clearly we know what a mini boss is.
[8043.26s -> 8044.26s]  Right?
[8044.26s -> 8045.26s]  Like the Crystillion.
[8045.26s -> 8046.26s]  That's a mini boss.
[8046.26s -> 8049.33s]  I'm just going to get them up here and they'll do it.
[8049.33s -> 8052.33s]  Dragonkin Soldier is kind of a mini boss.
[8052.33s -> 8053.33s]  Wouldn't it?
[8053.33s -> 8057.36s]  The Ancient Hero of Zamor.
[8057.36s -> 8058.36s]  That's a mini boss.
[8058.36s -> 8064.57s]  There are like five Tibia Mariners.
[8064.57s -> 8069.78s]  That's true.
[8069.78s -> 8070.78s]  Future...
[8070.78s -> 8071.78s]  Oh yeah.
[8071.78s -> 8072.78s]  All the tree avatars.
[8075.55s -> 8076.55s]  Okay.
[8076.55s -> 8080.73s]  Do you really think that Sanguine Noble is something that should be up on the boss list?
[8080.73s -> 8089.11s]  I don't think so.
[8089.11s -> 8091.11s]  Runebear is not a boss.
[8091.11s -> 8092.11s]  I know.
[8092.11s -> 8097.53s]  I know that they show up everywhere.
[8097.53s -> 8098.53s]  Royal Knight Loretta.
[8098.53s -> 8101.73s]  This is the same fight.
[8101.73s -> 8102.73s]  Just a little bit different.
[8102.73s -> 8104.73s]  I actually liked the first one more.
[8104.73s -> 8109.83s]  I'm going to put it up.
[8109.83s -> 8111.83s]  Beasts of Farum Azula.
[8111.83s -> 8113.97s]  About here.
[8113.97s -> 8114.97s]  Mini boss.
[8114.97s -> 8118.55s]  All the dragons are mini bosses.
[8118.55s -> 8119.55s]  Mini bosses.
[8119.55s -> 8120.55s]  They're going up in the same place.
[8120.55s -> 8124.86s]  Percival Knight.
[8124.86s -> 8125.86s]  Mini boss.
[8125.86s -> 8130.30s]  The second one is way better.
[8130.30s -> 8131.30s]  I liked the first one better.
[8131.30s -> 8132.30s]  I don't know why.
[8132.30s -> 8136.18s]  Our Urchary Avatar is times five.
[8136.18s -> 8138.19s]  Times three.
[8138.19s -> 8139.19s]  Times two.
[8139.19s -> 8140.19s]  Times...
[8140.19s -> 8141.19s]  Yeah.
[8141.19s -> 8144.16s]  Times two.
[8144.16s -> 8145.16s]  Percival Knight.
[8145.16s -> 8149.79s]  Yeah.
[8149.79s -> 8150.79s]  Wraith Worm.
[8150.79s -> 8152.79s]  This is technically a mini boss, right?
[8152.79s -> 8154.03s]  Technically.
[8154.03s -> 8158.96s]  Miranda the Blighted Bloom.
[8158.96s -> 8160.96s]  I don't even know what this was.
[8160.96s -> 8163.78s]  Percival Knight Duo.
[8163.78s -> 8166.96s]  I don't even know what that is.
[8166.96s -> 8167.96s]  Kindred of Wrought Duo.
[8167.96s -> 8168.96s]  Did I do those?
[8168.96s -> 8170.20s]  I think so.
[8170.20s -> 8172.21s]  Elber of the Briar.
[8172.21s -> 8174.58s]  I don't know what that is.
[8174.58s -> 8177.42s]  Fortisax is really cool.
[8177.42s -> 8179.42s]  That's going to pie on the mini boss list.
[8179.42s -> 8180.98s]  Wait.
[8180.98s -> 8181.98s]  Was Fortisax a mini boss?
[8181.98s -> 8187.38s]  Kind of, right?
[8187.38s -> 8188.38s]  No, it hadn't...
[8188.38s -> 8189.38s]  No, no, no, it wasn't.
[8189.38s -> 8191.38s]  But I just was so overleveled it felt like one.
[8191.38s -> 8196.18s]  It was a really, really cool fight though.
[8196.18s -> 8199.18s]  I just killed it in like not even a minute.
[8199.18s -> 8203.14s]  Oh, I remember Necromancer Garrus.
[8203.14s -> 8207.50s]  The Red Wolf of the Champions.
[8207.50s -> 8208.50s]  Yep.
[8208.50s -> 8210.50s]  That's a mini boss.
[8210.50s -> 8211.80s]  Spirit Caller Snail.
[8211.80s -> 8215.13s]  Did I fight that?
[8215.13s -> 8218.20s]  Mad Pumpkin Head.
[8218.20s -> 8221.94s]  Nox Duo.
[8221.94s -> 8222.94s]  I didn't do that.
[8222.94s -> 8225.30s]  Nox Duo.
[8225.30s -> 8229.23s]  Hezgar...
[8229.23s -> 8230.23s]  Well, that's not the right game.
[8230.23s -> 8232.92s]  Lienrot Knight Duo.
[8232.92s -> 8233.92s]  I don't think I did that either.
[8233.92s -> 8238.27s]  The Demi-Human Queen.
[8238.27s -> 8239.27s]  Three of them.
[8239.27s -> 8244.46s]  I think I did one of these.
[8244.46s -> 8245.46s]  Eve of Fire.
[8245.46s -> 8246.46s]  Did I do that?
[8246.46s -> 8247.46s]  I don't remember.
[8247.46s -> 8248.46s]  There's so many bosses I don't remember.
[8248.46s -> 8252.94s]  I remember the Crystalline Duo.
[8252.94s -> 8254.94s]  I remember Wyrmface.
[8254.94s -> 8258.01s]  Wyrmface was kind of a...
[8258.01s -> 8260.25s]  Was a real boss though.
[8260.25s -> 8263.73s]  Not really.
[8263.73s -> 8264.73s]  Did you even play Elden Ring?
[8264.73s -> 8265.73s]  Dude, I streamed all...
[8265.73s -> 8266.73s]  Yes.
[8266.73s -> 8271.32s]  Flying Dragon?
[8271.32s -> 8275.03s]  Commander O'Neil.
[8275.03s -> 8276.03s]  Didn't I already do this?
[8276.03s -> 8277.03s]  Was it a different person?
[8277.03s -> 8281.15s]  Featured avatars.
[8281.15s -> 8282.15s]  Yep.
[8282.15s -> 8283.15s]  Put them up there as well.
[8283.15s -> 8287.39s]  It's going to be way too hard to put these anywhere remotely up with all the regular
[8287.39s -> 8288.39s]  bosses, in quotes, right?
[8288.39s -> 8289.39s]  It just is.
[8289.39s -> 8297.99s]  Battle Mage Hughes?
[8297.99s -> 8298.99s]  Rafted Sion?
[8298.99s -> 8302.92s]  I don't know.
[8302.92s -> 8307.59s]  Did I fight this?
[8307.59s -> 8308.59s]  You're not doing a Tireless.
[8308.59s -> 8316.18s]  You're doing a shitty From Software wiki.
[8316.18s -> 8318.49s]  You have to put them up here.
[8318.49s -> 8320.49s]  I gotta put them up here first.
[8320.49s -> 8323.05s]  What do you mean?
[8323.05s -> 8328.12s]  There are like 300 squares in this.
[8328.12s -> 8332.58s]  This is not a wiki page.
[8332.58s -> 8338.84s]  This is a list of my favorite bosses throughout the whole series.
[8338.84s -> 8339.84s]  We haven't...
[8339.84s -> 8340.84s]  I have to get them up here.
[8340.84s -> 8348.88s]  There are 10 Knight's Calvaries?
[8348.88s -> 8354.38s]  Holy shit.
[8355.38s -> 8360.80s]  I didn't fight that.
[8360.80s -> 8365.70s]  I did fight the Falling Starbeast.
[8365.70s -> 8368.20s]  But not these ones.
[8368.20s -> 8369.20s]  Did I?
[8369.20s -> 8371.20s]  Where is it?
[8371.20s -> 8372.20s]  Yes.
[8372.20s -> 8375.08s]  Super Falling Starbeast, right?
[8375.08s -> 8377.08s]  That's when I fought.
[8377.08s -> 8384.17s]  Is that a miniboss?
[8384.17s -> 8390.12s]  These are minibosses?
[8390.12s -> 8392.36s]  Sentinel Tree Bob?
[8392.36s -> 8394.92s]  Brave Warden Flying Dragon?
[8394.92s -> 8395.92s]  You know what?
[8395.92s -> 8397.92s]  All the minibosses are on the same fucking level.
[8397.92s -> 8398.92s]  Okay.
[8398.92s -> 8400.92s]  There's too many.
[8400.92s -> 8404.57s]  And I didn't even do like a third of these.
[8404.57s -> 8407.90s]  So, minibosses are just...
[8407.90s -> 8411.70s]  Whatever.
[8411.70s -> 8412.70s]  We just delete it.
[8412.70s -> 8414.13s]  Yeah, just delete it.
[8414.13s -> 8415.56s]  Yeah.
[8415.56s -> 8416.56s]  I just delete it.
[8416.56s -> 8418.89s]  No.
[8418.89s -> 8420.89s]  All the minibosses, we're not even gonna put them.
[8420.89s -> 8421.89s]  Who cares?
[8421.89s -> 8425.11s]  No.
[8425.11s -> 8427.11s]  All the minibosses, they were cool, they were fun.
[8427.11s -> 8433.85s]  But I don't need to place like three Stone Digger Trolls.
[8433.85s -> 8440.39s]  So, who is a real boss that's still down here?
[8440.39s -> 8449.50s]  None of them.
[8449.50s -> 8451.51s]  They're all up there.
[8451.51s -> 8455.48s]  All the dragons, I'd say, are up there.
[8455.48s -> 8456.48s]  Wait.
[8456.48s -> 8461.69s]  Godskin?
[8461.69s -> 8462.69s]  There are too many.
[8462.69s -> 8465.53s]  Brave...
[8465.53s -> 8466.53s]  I don't know.
[8466.53s -> 8467.53s]  These are all minibosses.
[8467.53s -> 8468.53s]  Agent Dragon...
[8468.53s -> 8470.98s]  Oh, this one.
[8470.98s -> 8471.98s]  Right?
[8471.98s -> 8477.77s]  This is a boss.
[8477.77s -> 8479.14s]  This is a real boss.
[8479.14s -> 8480.14s]  This is the worst tier list.
[8480.14s -> 8481.14s]  Dude, just give me a minute.
[8481.14s -> 8482.14s]  I'm going to get...
[8482.14s -> 8488.18s]  I'm gonna put this shit where it goes.
[8488.18s -> 8489.18s]  Tibia Mariner.
[8489.18s -> 8490.48s]  Remove it.
[8490.48s -> 8494.85s]  But that's our wall to determine if somebody's cool or not.
[8494.85s -> 8495.85s]  All right.
[8495.85s -> 8496.85s]  There are four Tibia Mariners.
[8496.85s -> 8497.85s]  I get it.
[8497.85s -> 8500.73s]  But that's like the wall for...
[8500.73s -> 8501.73s]  It's something cool.
[8501.73s -> 8504.44s]  Fine.
[8504.44s -> 8505.44s]  I need to have a new wall then.
[8505.44s -> 8506.44s]  Fine.
[8506.44s -> 8513.31s]  Fine.
[8513.31s -> 8517.50s]  It's gone.
[8517.50s -> 8520.08s]  Okay.
[8520.08s -> 8523.50s]  We're good.
[8523.50s -> 8524.50s]  All right.
[8524.50s -> 8525.50s]  Put the Taurus Demon up there as a wall.
[8525.50s -> 8526.50s]  No.
[8526.50s -> 8527.80s]  The Taurus Demon sucks ass.
[8527.80s -> 8528.80s]  No.
[8528.80s -> 8534.67s]  That's not the wall of if you're cool.
[8534.67s -> 8536.67s]  The Taurus Demon is stupid.
[8536.67s -> 8538.10s]  All right.
[8538.10s -> 8541.41s]  The wall for if you are cooler than a sea.
[8541.41s -> 8551.10s]  Shit.
[8551.10s -> 8577.62s]  These have got to go.
[8577.62s -> 8578.62s]  I got to get rid of the miniboss.
[8578.62s -> 8585.23s]  These are miniboss versions.
[8585.23s -> 8586.23s]  You're working backwards.
[8586.23s -> 8587.23s]  It's a...
[8587.23s -> 8589.88s]  I got it.
[8590.88s -> 8598.01s]  The first Elden Lord, a lemonade version of him, is...
[8598.01s -> 8599.76s]  I would say...
[8599.76s -> 8601.19s]  What happened to my eye?
[8601.19s -> 8604.12s]  Is a sea.
[8604.12s -> 8605.94s]  Straight up sea.
[8605.94s -> 8609.74s]  Sea.
[8609.74s -> 8611.23s]  So...
[8611.23s -> 8616.12s]  We have to do some work here.
[8616.12s -> 8617.12s]  Death bird.
[8617.12s -> 8622.39s]  Get out.
[8622.39s -> 8624.75s]  Is Ranala cooler than the Godfrey?
[8624.75s -> 8628.22s]  Yeah.
[8628.22s -> 8631.42s]  Is Tower Knight cooler than Godfrey?
[8631.42s -> 8632.42s]  Radagon is definitely better.
[8632.42s -> 8639.86s]  I just thought...
[8639.86s -> 8640.86s]  I thought...
[8640.86s -> 8642.58s]  The Radagon right into the final boss.
[8642.58s -> 8646.26s]  Elden Beast.
[8646.26s -> 8647.26s]  Just...
[8647.26s -> 8649.78s]  I don't know.
[8649.78s -> 8651.46s]  I don't like that.
[8651.46s -> 8652.46s]  I don't know.
[8653.10s -> 8661.54s]  I'm okay with it being at a bit...
[8661.54s -> 8664.74s]  Radagon's fight was really cool and then they just like, all right, here, if I end the game
[8664.74s -> 8668.42s]  now.
[8668.42s -> 8669.42s]  The Elden Beast was all right.
[8669.42s -> 8670.42s]  I don't think it's bad.
[8670.42s -> 8672.42s]  I don't think it was great either though.
[8672.42s -> 8681.62s]  We got to start from the bottom.
[8681.62s -> 8682.90s]  No F's in Elden Ring?
[8682.90s -> 8683.90s]  Oh yeah, there is.
[8683.90s -> 8684.90s]  It's like two of the major characters.
[8684.90s -> 8698.34s]  Oh my god.
[8698.34s -> 8709.62s]  I will move Radan because Radan is better than the Asylum Demon, I guess.
[8709.62s -> 8710.62s]  Not...
[8710.62s -> 8711.62s]  I like Gideon more than Radan.
[8711.62s -> 8730.45s]  He can stay there.
[8730.49s -> 8735.80s]  We might see some S's from Sekiro.
[8735.80s -> 8736.80s]  We're almost done.
[8736.80s -> 8740.84s]  We've got Dark Souls 3 Sekiro and then Sprinkle in Dark Souls 2.
[8740.84s -> 8741.84s]  This is almost done.
[8741.84s -> 8748.36s]  Okay, let me get Elden Ring done.
[8748.36s -> 8751.37s]  Horolue, Slave Knight Gale.
[8751.37s -> 8755.66s]  Was Horolue cooler than Slave Knight Gale?
[8755.66s -> 8757.46s]  It's too recent, but I don't think so.
[8757.46s -> 8762.28s]  It's tricky.
[8762.28s -> 8767.49s]  I don't think so.
[8767.49s -> 8769.57s]  I think that makes sense to me.
[8769.57s -> 8771.53s]  I think this makes sense to me as well.
[8771.53s -> 8774.82s]  Now, that's recency bias.
[8774.82s -> 8783.42s]  Put it back.
[8783.54s -> 8791.20s]  These are the same boss, but I'm going to keep this one because it's Loretta, right?
[8791.20s -> 8793.88s]  This is kind of like the two versions of this boss.
[8793.88s -> 8803.50s]  Okay.
[8803.50s -> 8806.74s]  That's not fair.
[8806.74s -> 8807.74s]  I like that.
[8807.74s -> 8812.80s]  Ligarius is better than Malakith.
[8812.80s -> 8817.54s]  I feel like Malakith's fight is so quick.
[8817.54s -> 8819.44s]  It's just a DPS burn fight.
[8819.44s -> 8823.78s]  It's really cool, but I don't know.
[8823.78s -> 8833.62s]  I think some of these have to come back.
[8833.62s -> 8834.98s]  Malakith needs more HP.
[8839.04s -> 8841.80s]  How many humans do you sacrifice to look so young?
[8841.80s -> 8842.80s]  Zero.
[8842.80s -> 8844.12s]  I have a skincare routine.
[8844.12s -> 8848.42s]  I talked about it earlier during the Fortnite thing.
[8848.42s -> 8849.42s]  Moisturize your face.
[8849.42s -> 8850.42s]  Moisturize your face.
[8850.42s -> 8854.98s]  When you're out of the shower, get a nice light moisturizer and just get it on there
[8854.98s -> 8855.98s]  and rub it in.
[8855.98s -> 8858.64s]  It takes 10 seconds.
[8858.64s -> 8860.20s]  Please.
[8860.20s -> 8861.57s]  I'm telling you.
[8861.57s -> 8865.37s]  Do it.
[8865.37s -> 8866.37s]  All right.
[8866.37s -> 8873.69s]  Raikard was...
[8873.69s -> 8874.69s]  Raikard is...
[8874.69s -> 8875.69s]  Okay.
[8875.69s -> 8880.98s]  Raikard and Gaping Dragon are similar.
[8880.98s -> 8881.98s]  Fire Giant comes down.
[8882.22s -> 8894.24s]  Is Malakith cooler than Astel, probably?
[8894.24s -> 8895.24s]  But no.
[8895.24s -> 8896.60s]  But the fight doesn't last long enough.
[8896.60s -> 8900.06s]  Kalamith's probably not as cool, though.
[8900.06s -> 8904.24s]  Ligarius is cooler than all of them.
[8904.24s -> 8905.24s]  No smoking and no drinking.
[8905.24s -> 8906.90s]  I mean, I drink.
[8906.90s -> 8914.97s]  I drink maybe once a month, maybe five or six times a year, maybe.
[8914.97s -> 8919.60s]  Maybe like 10 times a year, maybe.
[8919.60s -> 8920.60s]  I don't smoke.
[8920.60s -> 8922.32s]  I don't really drink that often.
[8922.72s -> 8932.85s]  I mean, I dabble in THC a little with CBD, but not, you know, crazy.
[8932.85s -> 8935.66s]  I don't drink that much alcohol, though.
[8935.66s -> 8937.61s]  All right.
[8937.61s -> 8942.82s]  Let's keep going.
[8942.82s -> 8948.21s]  I actually don't think I have to move any of this.
[8948.21s -> 8949.21s]  Maybe this.
[8949.21s -> 8950.21s]  I'm trying...
[8950.21s -> 8951.65s]  I wish I bought this at the right level.
[8951.65s -> 8957.31s]  It would probably be way higher.
[8957.31s -> 8958.55s]  What's cooler than the Tree Sentinel?
[8958.55s -> 8959.99s]  Like, let's be honest.
[8959.99s -> 8966.34s]  Yeah.
[8966.34s -> 8967.34s]  I like this.
[8967.34s -> 8972.18s]  I think this is good.
[8972.18s -> 8973.70s]  Shadow's Yarnham cooler than Ranala.
[8973.70s -> 8974.70s]  Yep.
[8974.74s -> 8975.74s]  Noble needs to come down.
[8975.74s -> 8978.14s]  How does the old hero...
[8978.14s -> 8980.14s]  The old hero and old punk.
[8980.14s -> 8988.74s]  Okay, nobody move.
[8988.74s -> 8992.70s]  Is Gideon cooler than Godfrey?
[8992.70s -> 8995.03s]  What do you think?
[8995.03s -> 9001.46s]  He might...
[9001.46s -> 9007.30s]  It might be.
[9007.30s -> 9008.48s]  Hmm.
[9008.48s -> 9017.98s]  Maybe.
[9017.98s -> 9018.98s]  Okay.
[9018.98s -> 9019.98s]  Yeah.
[9019.98s -> 9020.98s]  You know, you're right.
[9020.98s -> 9021.98s]  You're right.
[9021.98s -> 9022.98s]  You're right.
[9022.98s -> 9023.98s]  Right.
[9023.98s -> 9025.86s]  Fia's Champion belongs down here.
[9025.86s -> 9026.86s]  I'm gonna put Melania behind the Mimic tier.
[9026.86s -> 9027.86s]  I laughed out loud.
[9027.86s -> 9029.42s]  No, I'm not.
[9029.42s -> 9030.42s]  Fuck that fight.
[9030.42s -> 9031.42s]  I was just doing that to make you happy.
[9031.42s -> 9033.59s]  And this is my list.
[9033.59s -> 9034.59s]  Sorry.
[9034.59s -> 9038.78s]  I'm sorry.
[9038.82s -> 9042.46s]  I think Elden Ring is good.
[9042.46s -> 9044.46s]  Three A's from Elden Ring so far.
[9044.46s -> 9045.64s]  Do they belong up there?
[9045.64s -> 9046.64s]  And one S.
[9046.64s -> 9057.62s]  No representation at all from Dark Souls 1.
[9057.62s -> 9061.91s]  You missed like 60 bosses.
[9061.91s -> 9063.91s]  I think I'm okay with that.
[9063.91s -> 9072.10s]  I think because there's a lot of B's and A's.
[9072.10s -> 9073.10s]  Margit was...
[9073.10s -> 9077.82s]  Yeah, the Ancestor Spirit I like more than some of these.
[9077.82s -> 9079.50s]  Right there.
[9079.50s -> 9081.37s]  Right there.
[9081.37s -> 9083.50s]  Right here.
[9083.50s -> 9084.50s]  Gwynn, come back.
[9084.50s -> 9085.50s]  You were stupid.
[9085.50s -> 9087.68s]  You were cool but stupid.
[9087.68s -> 9095.26s]  And you too.
[9095.26s -> 9096.26s]  Okay.
[9096.26s -> 9098.90s]  I like what they are.
[9098.94s -> 9100.44s]  All right.
[9100.44s -> 9101.44s]  Looks good so far.
[9101.44s -> 9104.00s]  Now it's time...
[9104.00s -> 9106.37s]  Remember we're not doing mini bosses.
[9106.37s -> 9107.37s]  So all these.
[9107.37s -> 9108.37s]  These like...
[9108.37s -> 9109.37s]  The Shinobi Hunter.
[9109.37s -> 9110.74s]  The Headless.
[9110.74s -> 9113.74s]  We're not doing any of the mini bosses because that would be way too hard.
[9113.74s -> 9120.35s]  We should go to bed.
[9120.35s -> 9121.35s]  This is not going to take that much longer.
[9121.35s -> 9122.35s]  No, let's do Dark Souls 3.
[9122.35s -> 9123.35s]  I don't...
[9123.35s -> 9127.73s]  Let's do Dark Souls 3.
[9127.73s -> 9128.73s]  Yeah, Dark Souls 3 is a good idea.
[9128.73s -> 9134.06s]  Okay.
[9134.06s -> 9135.06s]  Pontiff Sullivan.
[9135.06s -> 9139.03s]  Pontiff Sullivan is going to be up here.
[9139.03s -> 9148.65s]  Cooler than Lagarius but I don't think cooler than Loretta.
[9148.65s -> 9150.91s]  Maybe.
[9150.91s -> 9157.46s]  I think so.
[9157.50s -> 9164.93s]  The ones that I remember...
[9164.93s -> 9165.93s]  I remember this fight.
[9165.93s -> 9166.93s]  I don't like it.
[9166.93s -> 9167.93s]  This is like a D.
[9167.93s -> 9171.10s]  This is the caster with the big tail.
[9171.10s -> 9172.10s]  Yeah.
[9172.10s -> 9173.10s]  Didn't like that one very much.
[9173.10s -> 9176.18s]  It was kind of like eh.
[9176.18s -> 9177.18s]  Put that next to Gideon I think.
[9177.18s -> 9180.44s]  The fight was kind of ass.
[9180.44s -> 9183.02s]  All right.
[9183.02s -> 9184.02s]  Gundyr.
[9184.02s -> 9185.02s]  I'm going to just put one Gundyr.
[9185.02s -> 9188.02s]  And I actually really like the Gundyr fight.
[9188.02s -> 9190.02s]  Except the phase two is kind of annoying.
[9190.02s -> 9191.33s]  But I like the fight.
[9191.33s -> 9195.26s]  Let's put...
[9195.26s -> 9197.26s]  Where's champion Gundyr?
[9197.26s -> 9200.52s]  We'll leave index down here because it's literally the same thing.
[9200.56s -> 9206.49s]  Oh, the Lothric Prince fight.
[9206.49s -> 9207.49s]  That was awesome.
[9207.49s -> 9214.30s]  Yep.
[9214.30s -> 9215.30s]  That's going up to A.
[9215.30s -> 9217.24s]  I liked that fight.
[9217.24s -> 9221.18s]  Somebody's riding on the other ones back.
[9221.18s -> 9223.58s]  Can we get a refresher?
[9223.58s -> 9224.58s]  Yeah, we can do some refreshers.
[9224.58s -> 9225.58s]  Turn the music off.
[9225.58s -> 9228.67s]  Why can I not?
[9228.67s -> 9238.15s]  Okay.
[9238.15s -> 9240.15s]  We'll do some refreshers on some of these.
[9240.15s -> 9241.15s]  We don't need too much though.
[9241.15s -> 9246.36s]  Okay.
[9246.36s -> 9248.11s]  This is index Gundyr.
[9248.11s -> 9249.11s]  Vort.
[9249.11s -> 9250.11s]  I don't think we need it.
[9250.11s -> 9251.11s]  All these...
[9251.11s -> 9252.11s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[9252.11s -> 9253.11s]  How do I get this one in F?
[9253.11s -> 9254.11s]  Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[9254.11s -> 9256.57s]  In a single video.
[9256.57s -> 9257.57s]  That's right.
[9257.61s -> 9263.13s]  Curse Rod of Greatwood is just the Erd Tree avatars, but way bigger and more annoying.
[9263.13s -> 9271.17s]  You had to like pop the bubbles, right?
[9271.17s -> 9273.17s]  Yeah, that one was okay.
[9273.17s -> 9279.44s]  Crystal Sage was kind of rage inducing.
[9279.44s -> 9281.44s]  I know everyone thought that was one of the easiest bosses.
[9281.44s -> 9282.44s]  It took me a long time.
[9282.44s -> 9283.44s]  I remember...
[9283.44s -> 9285.44s]  I remember dying like 20 times to this on stream.
[9285.44s -> 9290.64s]  How's that annoying teleport and then bring every...
[9290.64s -> 9292.64s]  You just clone yourself 10 times.
[9292.64s -> 9294.64s]  The Abyss Watchers were cool.
[9294.64s -> 9299.12s]  Probably B, I would say.
[9299.16s -> 9301.55s]  That fight was pretty fun.
[9301.55s -> 9302.55s]  They fight each other.
[9302.55s -> 9309.82s]  And then it gets all smoky and fiery.
[9309.82s -> 9310.82s]  Yeah, this was cool.
[9310.82s -> 9318.66s]  I feel like a lot of the Dark Souls 3 bosses are going to be very high.
[9318.66s -> 9319.66s]  That was kind of...
[9319.66s -> 9320.66s]  That was kind of like the shine...
[9320.66s -> 9324.01s]  I can't even speak.
[9324.01s -> 9327.01s]  That was kind of the shining part of the game for Dark Souls 3 for me.
[9327.01s -> 9328.01s]  It was...
[9328.01s -> 9329.01s]  The bosses I thought were great.
[9329.01s -> 9331.01s]  Deacons are going to be F.
[9331.01s -> 9332.01s]  Comedy F though.
[9332.01s -> 9336.32s]  So it's not like I hate it.
[9336.32s -> 9338.07s]  It's just...
[9338.07s -> 9339.07s]  The fight is not that great.
[9339.07s -> 9340.07s]  Wolnir...
[9340.07s -> 9341.07s]  Oh, yeah.
[9341.07s -> 9347.56s]  This is the big guy with the handgun.
[9347.60s -> 9348.60s]  Oh, yeah.
[9348.60s -> 9349.60s]  This is the big guy with the hands.
[9349.60s -> 9351.60s]  You have to hit the bracelet, right?
[9351.60s -> 9353.42s]  This guy was cool.
[9353.42s -> 9354.91s]  Fuck, man.
[9354.91s -> 9355.91s]  This is a good game.
[9355.91s -> 9362.18s]  Old Demon King.
[9362.18s -> 9365.92s]  I remember this one.
[9365.92s -> 9369.34s]  What was this one?
[9369.34s -> 9373.33s]  Oh, yeah.
[9373.33s -> 9374.33s]  Am I...
[9374.33s -> 9383.47s]  Do I have rose-tinted glasses on or is this game amazing?
[9383.47s -> 9388.62s]  Pontiff.
[9388.62s -> 9389.62s]  Yeah, we already know Pontiff.
[9389.62s -> 9390.62s]  Aldrich.
[9390.62s -> 9393.92s]  Yhorm is probably a D.
[9393.92s -> 9394.92s]  It's a gimmick fight.
[9394.92s -> 9398.92s]  Yhorm is just Rikard but boring.
[9398.96s -> 9402.48s]  This is the same exact fight.
[9402.48s -> 9403.48s]  No difference at all.
[9403.48s -> 9408.50s]  Okay.
[9408.50s -> 9410.12s]  Dancer, the boy real.
[9410.12s -> 9411.12s]  Dancer was cool.
[9411.12s -> 9413.12s]  I beat Dancer first try.
[9413.12s -> 9417.09s]  Although a little spammy though.
[9417.09s -> 9420.09s]  I'm not sure this is higher than a B- or a C.
[9420.09s -> 9422.10s]  There's a little spammy.
[9422.10s -> 9430.50s]  Dragonslayer?
[9430.50s -> 9431.50s]  Armor?
[9431.50s -> 9436.65s]  D.
[9436.65s -> 9437.65s]  This guy sucks.
[9437.65s -> 9444.98s]  This is the guy that leaves the area and shoots you with fucking shit from across the game.
[9444.98s -> 9446.47s]  I hated this fight.
[9446.47s -> 9448.47s]  This guy was annoying.
[9448.47s -> 9452.12s]  And all that crap comes in just spamming at you.
[9452.16s -> 9453.16s]  Yeah, this fight.
[9453.16s -> 9454.16s]  This guy's a D+.
[9454.16s -> 9457.83s]  This guy leaves and then...
[9457.83s -> 9458.83s]  Yeah, he does.
[9458.83s -> 9459.83s]  Watch.
[9459.83s -> 9463.25s]  He leaves.
[9463.25s -> 9464.25s]  He doesn't leave?
[9464.25s -> 9468.90s]  Who's the boss that leaves the area and then spams shit at you?
[9468.90s -> 9477.22s]  This guy does not do that.
[9477.22s -> 9481.14s]  Butterfly?
[9481.14s -> 9483.98s]  Okay, well.
[9483.98s -> 9487.98s]  I love this.
[9487.98s -> 9488.98s]  I love this fight.
[9488.98s -> 9491.86s]  There's an old little ocelot.
[9491.86s -> 9493.86s]  I will protect you.
[9493.86s -> 9495.03s]  Is it A?
[9495.03s -> 9504.93s]  He's holding what he thinks is like a baby or something?
[9504.93s -> 9505.93s]  Yeah, this is a cool fight.
[9505.93s -> 9506.93s]  This is a wild boss.
[9506.93s -> 9508.93s]  This is at least A+.
[9508.93s -> 9511.19s]  This is terrifying.
[9511.23s -> 9521.86s]  There's Champion Gundyr, so I think this should be pretty high too.
[9521.86s -> 9522.86s]  Damn.
[9522.86s -> 9529.66s]  Am I being shown that I actually like Dark Souls 3 more than all of them?
[9529.66s -> 9532.02s]  I think that's what's happening.
[9532.02s -> 9538.08s]  This is the Lothric fight where he rides on his back.
[9538.08s -> 9547.45s]  Yep.
[9547.45s -> 9548.45s]  Okay.
[9548.45s -> 9549.45s]  I like that fight a lot.
[9549.45s -> 9551.94s]  Ancient Wyvern.
[9551.94s -> 9556.38s]  Oh, this was kind of a gimmick, right?
[9556.38s -> 9558.38s]  Don't you just like jump on his head?
[9558.38s -> 9560.14s]  Eh.
[9560.14s -> 9561.14s]  Like D.
[9561.14s -> 9567.30s]  Well, let's just see it, right?
[9567.30s -> 9568.30s]  Might as well.
[9568.30s -> 9573.04s]  Yeah, you have to just run through this.
[9573.08s -> 9574.08s]  I remember.
[9574.08s -> 9575.08s]  It was such a pain in the ass.
[9575.08s -> 9576.08s]  Just to jump on him and kill him.
[9576.08s -> 9577.08s]  Yeah.
[9577.08s -> 9580.05s]  Nah.
[9580.05s -> 9581.05s]  This is pretty low.
[9581.05s -> 9583.44s]  We don't need to see it.
[9583.44s -> 9584.44s]  Nameless King.
[9584.44s -> 9586.44s]  Yeah, this is a great one.
[9586.44s -> 9592.33s]  Riding the Dragon.
[9592.33s -> 9602.94s]  This was insane.
[9602.94s -> 9606.94s]  He gets off the dragon and you're like, oh my god, I gotta fight this guy.
[9606.94s -> 9613.78s]  Might as well just refresh, right?
[9613.78s -> 9614.78s]  See if we can remember.
[9614.78s -> 9623.55s]  Yeah, this is awesome.
[9623.55s -> 9624.55s]  This is probably S.
[9624.55s -> 9627.55s]  This might be the S from Dark Souls 3.
[9627.55s -> 9633.70s]  The music too was so crazy.
[9633.74s -> 9637.13s]  Soul of Cinder.
[9637.13s -> 9638.13s]  Oh, this is the last one.
[9638.13s -> 9639.13s]  Yeah, this guy was not...
[9639.13s -> 9640.13s]  It was alright.
[9640.13s -> 9642.88s]  I would say Nameless King.
[9642.88s -> 9647.88s]  You should have just given Soul of Cinder Nameless King's moveset and encounter.
[9647.88s -> 9656.86s]  I remember having fun fighting this, but I don't know if it's S.
[9656.86s -> 9661.42s]  Okay.
[9661.42s -> 9664.46s]  This is the DLC.
[9664.46s -> 9667.46s]  This is the wolf and the grave guy, right?
[9667.46s -> 9668.46s]  The gravetender.
[9668.46s -> 9671.40s]  This looks like such shit.
[9671.40s -> 9676.80s]  720p.
[9676.80s -> 9683.90s]  I think I got really mad at this one.
[9683.94s -> 9692.54s]  Yeah, because the wolf could just sprint at you randomly and just...
[9692.54s -> 9694.54s]  He ran across the map like three times.
[9694.54s -> 9695.54s]  This fight was...
[9695.54s -> 9696.54s]  I don't like this.
[9696.54s -> 9697.54s]  It was bad.
[9697.54s -> 9701.40s]  It wasn't necessarily bad.
[9701.40s -> 9702.40s]  It was just...
[9702.40s -> 9703.40s]  I don't know.
[9703.40s -> 9708.67s]  It was just frustrating.
[9708.67s -> 9709.67s]  This is the guy stuck in the chair.
[9709.67s -> 9712.67s]  I remember laughing at this, so that's at least a B.
[9712.67s -> 9720.48s]  Yeah, this is the guy that was stuck in the chair.
[9720.48s -> 9730.85s]  Yeah, then he gets angry and you fight him both at the same time.
[9730.85s -> 9737.35s]  I don't think I beat this on stream without help.
[9737.35s -> 9739.53s]  Do I remember that correctly?
[9739.57s -> 9742.38s]  I think I got to a point where I was like, no, I don't care.
[9742.38s -> 9743.38s]  Just come help me.
[9743.38s -> 9748.25s]  It was a cool encounter, though.
[9748.25s -> 9754.97s]  Let's just see the chair because it's funny.
[9754.97s -> 9767.37s]  Really cool, though.
[9767.37s -> 9768.37s]  All right.
[9768.37s -> 9770.37s]  Demon Prince and two demons.
[9770.37s -> 9774.62s]  Phase three is S tier.
[9774.62s -> 9780.21s]  Did I do this?
[9780.21s -> 9783.94s]  Demon in pain.
[9783.94s -> 9785.94s]  Demon from below.
[9785.94s -> 9791.06s]  Did I do this?
[9791.06s -> 9795.63s]  You did.
[9795.63s -> 9797.45s]  Took me a lot of...
[9797.45s -> 9799.45s]  Oh, I did do this.
[9799.45s -> 9800.45s]  Yeah, I remember the area.
[9800.45s -> 9805.57s]  Spear of the Church.
[9805.57s -> 9813.02s]  It's a boss.
[9813.02s -> 9816.79s]  Oh, this is the invasion one.
[9816.83s -> 9818.83s]  The PVP one.
[9818.83s -> 9825.55s]  Yeah, it was all right.
[9825.55s -> 9833.74s]  But whatever.
[9833.74s -> 9836.52s]  Afflite?
[9836.52s -> 9842.54s]  Yeah, the whole Spear of the Church thing was kind of...
[9842.54s -> 9843.54s]  It was okay.
[9843.54s -> 9845.54s]  It was an interesting encounter.
[9845.54s -> 9850.80s]  This is the one where it was actually like people could have invaded you and tried to kill you, right?
[9850.80s -> 9857.78s]  Which is really funny.
[9857.78s -> 9862.38s]  And then Medir, which...
[9862.38s -> 9865.38s]  We tried to Mario Party this boss and I don't think we beat it.
[9865.38s -> 9876.50s]  All these bosses are absolutely amazing, though.
[9876.50s -> 9880.66s]  And then who could forget this?
[9880.66s -> 9881.66s]  He's already an S.
[9881.70s -> 9886.66s]  Slave Knight Gale already an S might be the best.
[9886.66s -> 9895.15s]  This is another one of those fights that just felt like a dance.
[9895.15s -> 9898.82s]  It was tough.
[9898.82s -> 9899.82s]  It was really hard.
[9899.82s -> 9900.82s]  It was fair.
[9900.82s -> 9903.83s]  There was a lot of interesting things going on.
[9903.83s -> 9912.22s]  Dark Souls 3 is too easy.
[9912.22s -> 9916.82s]  Um, I don't think so.
[9916.82s -> 9918.82s]  I thought Dark Souls 3 was actually really hard.
[9918.82s -> 9925.03s]  This was so fun.
[9925.03s -> 9929.60s]  I remember I didn't get mad.
[9929.60s -> 9932.60s]  You know how you can tell when a boss is really, really good?
[9932.60s -> 9936.78s]  When I don't get mad at it at all.
[9936.78s -> 9939.02s]  It's just like, wow, this is amazing.
[9939.06s -> 9941.06s]  I can't wait to fight that again.
[9941.06s -> 9944.42s]  All the things that are in S tier were that for me.
[9944.42s -> 9951.85s]  You mean when it's easy?
[9951.85s -> 9959.49s]  Garmin is not easy.
[9959.49s -> 9961.92s]  Horoloo is not easy.
[9961.92s -> 9966.63s]  Ludwig is not easy either.
[9966.63s -> 9971.41s]  You know how many times I died to the first phase of Ludwig?
[9971.41s -> 9975.95s]  Horoloo is easy.
[9975.95s -> 9977.95s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9977.95s -> 9980.60s]  This is a great fight.
[9980.60s -> 9981.97s]  This fight is not even easy.
[9981.97s -> 9982.97s]  What are you talking about?
[9982.97s -> 9988.02s]  Okay, it's time.
[9988.02s -> 9991.38s]  What time is it?
[9991.38s -> 9994.86s]  Oh, God, it's getting late.
[9994.90s -> 9996.90s]  How long have I been doing this for?
[9996.90s -> 10005.37s]  All right, let's do it.
[10005.37s -> 10006.37s]  This is where they belong.
[10006.37s -> 10007.37s]  Old Demon King.
[10007.37s -> 10011.37s]  We'll see you up at the B tier.
[10011.37s -> 10012.99s]  B minus.
[10012.99s -> 10019.76s]  You're on the giant.
[10019.76s -> 10022.54s]  Dancer, B.
[10022.54s -> 10025.29s]  Maybe high C, low B.
[10025.29s -> 10031.07s]  Here it is.
[10031.07s -> 10033.07s]  Okay, this is the Ocelot.
[10033.07s -> 10034.76s]  This is A.
[10034.76s -> 10038.34s]  I'm going to have to move that around.
[10038.34s -> 10043.34s]  Champion Gundyr, high B.
[10043.34s -> 10050.05s]  The reason why I want to do this so bad is because I want to see what game I actually liked the least.
[10050.05s -> 10051.05s]  And here's the crazy thing.
[10051.09s -> 10055.33s]  Dark Souls 1 looks like the game I fucking liked the absolute least.
[10055.33s -> 10062.54s]  I came to watch the Fortnite VOD, but he's still streaming this stupid tier list.
[10062.54s -> 10068.54s]  I hate to break it to you, but there was probably like six minutes of Fortnite gameplay in three hours.
[10068.54s -> 10075.46s]  We were looking at a spectator screen.
[10075.46s -> 10077.46s]  If that's what you're here for, I'm sorry.
[10077.46s -> 10080.08s]  That's not what you're going to get.
[10080.08s -> 10083.09s]  You came here for Fortnite.
[10083.09s -> 10090.12s]  I should just delete that VOD, because it's literally five minutes of content in like three hours.
[10090.12s -> 10094.66s]  We got to play for like ten minutes.
[10094.66s -> 10103.50s]  You have Demon Souls?
[10103.54s -> 10104.54s]  Very low.
[10104.54s -> 10109.14s]  Yeah, but I need to do the remake.
[10109.14s -> 10116.12s]  Everyone's going to bother me about Fortnite.
[10116.12s -> 10122.39s]  Oh no, it was fun.
[10122.39s -> 10124.39s]  I actually had a great time.
[10124.39s -> 10127.39s]  It was fun yucking it up with the boys.
[10127.39s -> 10133.00s]  But if you're talking about Fortnite gameplay, what you're looking for, that's not what happened.
[10133.00s -> 10138.06s]  That is absolutely not what happened.
[10138.06s -> 10141.13s]  The remake is exactly the same.
[10141.13s -> 10144.13s]  Yeah, but I'm remembering PlayStation 3.
[10144.13s -> 10145.37s]  Right?
[10145.37s -> 10147.06s]  Okay, let's keep going.
[10147.10s -> 10152.64s]  Oh, the daunting task is almost complete.
[10152.64s -> 10158.35s]  Because I'm going to be able to burn through a lot of Sekiro really quickly.
[10158.35s -> 10163.22s]  Index Gundyr, I don't need to go up there.
[10163.22s -> 10169.18s]  Dragon Slayer armor, that's the one we just watched when I thought it was a different encounter.
[10169.18s -> 10170.18s]  We're going to put it up here.
[10170.18s -> 10172.45s]  They're all Fs.
[10172.45s -> 10177.99s]  No, a lot, some of the Sekiro fights were really cool.
[10177.99s -> 10179.99s]  I don't, some of them were probably going to be high.
[10179.99s -> 10184.98s]  I really didn't like this fight at all.
[10184.98s -> 10186.35s]  I didn't.
[10186.35s -> 10192.42s]  Medir, I didn't really beat it.
[10192.42s -> 10197.54s]  Half-Light, yeah, this is a gimmick fight.
[10197.54s -> 10199.54s]  It was cool, but let's see.
[10199.58s -> 10205.00s]  Vort was fun.
[10205.00s -> 10206.00s]  I think Vort's at least a B.
[10206.00s -> 10210.61s]  First Rod of Gwe...
[10210.61s -> 10217.02s]  C.
[10217.02s -> 10218.02s]  Nameless King?
[10218.02s -> 10225.51s]  Yeah.
[10225.51s -> 10230.85s]  S.
[10230.85s -> 10231.85s]  The Deacons are F.
[10231.85s -> 10234.60s]  Welnir is somewhere in the Cs.
[10234.60s -> 10240.12s]  Once this is here, I'm going to make sure it's very accurate, so don't worry.
[10240.12s -> 10243.12s]  Demon Princes, I didn't even remember the fight, so I must not have liked it.
[10243.12s -> 10249.60s]  Crystal Sage, not F, but no, it's low C.
[10249.60s -> 10256.68s]  Abyss Watchers, high B, low A.
[10256.68s -> 10261.63s]  Put it here for now.
[10261.63s -> 10262.81s]  Demon Prince is good.
[10262.81s -> 10263.81s]  Welnir is like a low D.
[10263.85s -> 10272.53s]  Fried, is that Fried and Soup Guy?
[10272.53s -> 10273.53s]  The one stuck in the chair?
[10273.53s -> 10274.53s]  That's up there.
[10274.53s -> 10275.53s]  It was crazy.
[10275.53s -> 10283.32s]  I can't say it was an S, though.
[10283.32s -> 10284.32s]  All right.
[10284.32s -> 10286.62s]  Gunder's staying down here.
[10286.62s -> 10291.96s]  Wyvern, F.
[10291.96s -> 10293.39s]  Is that fair?
[10293.39s -> 10294.39s]  We'll find out.
[10294.39s -> 10297.76s]  Soul of Cinder, C, high C.
[10297.76s -> 10300.76s]  No, that was a B, let's be fair.
[10300.76s -> 10301.76s]  Okay.
[10301.76s -> 10305.92s]  Dark Souls 3 is up there.
[10305.92s -> 10309.82s]  We just have Sekiro and Dark Souls 2.
[10309.82s -> 10310.82s]  Make sure this is correct.
[10310.86s -> 10311.86s]  Put some music on.
[10311.86s -> 10312.86s]  Oh, we had the Hollow Knight one on.
[10312.86s -> 10313.86s]  That's fine.
[10313.86s -> 10318.50s]  Yeah, it's getting late.
[10318.50s -> 10324.49s]  Oh my god, I've been doing this for like four hours.
[10324.49s -> 10330.02s]  Holy shit.
[10330.02s -> 10331.02s]  Wow.
[10331.02s -> 10332.02s]  What?
[10332.02s -> 10334.02s]  No, I haven't been doing this for four hours.
[10334.02s -> 10337.43s]  Why am I so into this?
[10337.43s -> 10340.43s]  I've been doing this for four hours?
[10340.43s -> 10341.43s]  I actually can't believe that.
[10341.43s -> 10346.83s]  All right, I gotta hurry up.
[10346.83s -> 10347.83s]  Jesus.
[10347.83s -> 10352.59s]  All right, let's get this correct.
[10352.59s -> 10353.59s]  Wow.
[10353.59s -> 10357.71s]  Cool.
[10357.71s -> 10363.50s]  That was a good, that was a good tuba reaction.
[10363.50s -> 10365.76s]  Yeah.
[10365.80s -> 10369.54s]  Was it?
[10369.54s -> 10374.08s]  No, not this, not the second stream that I turned on.
[10374.08s -> 10376.38s]  I don't think this was Fortnite.
[10376.38s -> 10379.56s]  I think that first stream died and I did the second one, right?
[10379.56s -> 10380.56s]  All right.
[10380.56s -> 10381.56s]  Old Demon King.
[10381.56s -> 10383.82s]  I can stay there.
[10383.82s -> 10384.82s]  Dancer should be up here.
[10384.82s -> 10386.82s]  This is going to get so hard eventually here.
[10386.82s -> 10391.54s]  Is Dancer cooler than the spirit from Elden Ring?
[10391.54s -> 10393.48s]  I think so.
[10393.48s -> 10394.48s]  Probably.
[10394.48s -> 10403.89s]  And I think Dancer is better than Soul of Cinder as well.
[10403.89s -> 10415.70s]  I think the real test is going to be this one.
[10415.70s -> 10429.86s]  I don't know.
[10429.86s -> 10432.95s]  I don't know.
[10432.95s -> 10433.95s]  I don't know.
[10433.95s -> 10434.95s]  I don't know.
[10434.95s -> 10437.02s]  I don't know.
[10437.06s -> 10439.06s]  The real test is going over the dragons from Elden Ring.
[10439.06s -> 10447.02s]  That's the real test.
[10447.02s -> 10451.21s]  Is Pontiff Sullivan?
[10451.21s -> 10452.21s]  Yes, yes he is.
[10452.21s -> 10453.83s]  Yes.
[10453.83s -> 10457.70s]  Yes.
[10457.70s -> 10458.94s]  No.
[10458.94s -> 10468.22s]  No.
[10468.22s -> 10469.22s]  The dragons were snooze?
[10469.22s -> 10470.22s]  No.
[10470.22s -> 10471.22s]  Were they?
[10471.22s -> 10472.22s]  I think that they're okay.
[10472.22s -> 10490.73s]  Bistwatcher is definitely, I think so.
[10490.73s -> 10495.72s]  Raid was also cooler than this.
[10495.72s -> 10503.04s]  Damn.
[10503.04s -> 10507.35s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[10507.35s -> 10510.35s]  Five bosses from Dark Souls 3 or A or above.
[10510.35s -> 10512.85s]  I still have to put some more up there.
[10512.85s -> 10521.87s]  Fire Giant was probably, yeah.
[10521.91s -> 10525.34s]  Radagon and Elden Beast are better than these at the very least.
[10525.34s -> 10526.34s]  I think so.
[10526.34s -> 10528.34s]  That was a cool fight.
[10528.34s -> 10531.80s]  I think it goes right against the wall here.
[10531.80s -> 10533.62s]  You have a McDonald's?
[10533.62s -> 10534.62s]  Nice.
[10534.62s -> 10536.05s]  What's your order?
[10536.05s -> 10550.49s]  I actually think this is a good barrier here.
[10550.49s -> 10552.98s]  That's cooler than Gideon.
[10552.98s -> 10560.66s]  Crystal Sage, Cooler.
[10560.66s -> 10561.66s]  Wulner is higher.
[10561.66s -> 10564.80s]  I like, Old Demon King should be in C.
[10564.80s -> 10568.73s]  You know what?
[10568.73s -> 10570.73s]  Wulner was awesome because when you went to Wulner's room,
[10570.73s -> 10573.22s]  it was just pitch black.
[10573.22s -> 10575.22s]  And then you keep going and all of a sudden he's like,
[10575.26s -> 10576.50s]  it's like, holy shit.
[10576.50s -> 10577.50s]  What the fuck is that?
[10577.50s -> 10579.90s]  I like that a lot.
[10579.90s -> 10587.15s]  This stays down here.
[10587.15s -> 10589.15s]  This stays down here.
[10589.15s -> 10597.52s]  This can go up above Nito and above Ranallo.
[10597.52s -> 10605.16s]  Yeah, this goes down here.
[10605.16s -> 10607.16s]  That's a gimmick fight, but it was cool.
[10607.16s -> 10610.13s]  All right.
[10610.13s -> 10611.13s]  How we look?
[10611.13s -> 10617.49s]  I actually think I'm OK with this.
[10617.49s -> 10618.49s]  I think this is perfect.
[10618.49s -> 10623.42s]  The only thing I would change up here,
[10623.42s -> 10631.93s]  surprisingly low for Medir.
[10631.93s -> 10634.36s]  I just, it took too long.
[10634.36s -> 10636.36s]  Medir had way too much health.
[10636.36s -> 10637.36s]  It was just annoying.
[10637.36s -> 10645.26s]  You just suck.
[10645.26s -> 10654.47s]  I think design-wise Medir was awesome.
[10654.51s -> 10656.51s]  I just realized it's just way too much health.
[10656.51s -> 10659.20s]  I remember summoning like four people
[10659.20s -> 10663.20s]  and we gave Medir like five, four times more health
[10663.20s -> 10665.20s]  and we couldn't even hurt him.
[10665.20s -> 10671.30s]  I think collectively the four of us did like 30% damage to him.
[10671.30s -> 10689.28s]  I'll put Millennia up at D.
[10689.28s -> 10692.48s]  F is for truly.
[10692.48s -> 10693.48s]  Well, no.
[10693.48s -> 10700.05s]  F is for dog shit.
[10700.05s -> 10704.98s]  Millennia's fight sucks, but is it like the witches of Hemwick?
[10704.98s -> 10707.54s]  I mean, no, it's not.
[10707.54s -> 10708.54s]  It's OK.
[10708.58s -> 10714.68s]  It's OK.
[10714.68s -> 10716.94s]  All right.
[10716.94s -> 10719.66s]  I'm happy with it.
[10719.66s -> 10721.47s]  Time for Sekiro.
[10721.47s -> 10723.47s]  Sekiro only really has a handful
[10723.47s -> 10726.47s]  and we could probably get a couple of refreshers here.
[10726.47s -> 10733.74s]  Imagine liking the Millennia fight.
[10733.74s -> 10735.74s]  I mean, it's not bad.
[10735.74s -> 10737.11s]  It's just awful.
[10737.11s -> 10739.63s]  All right.
[10739.63s -> 10741.70s]  Sekiro.
[10741.70s -> 10743.70s]  We need to do a little bit of research here
[10743.70s -> 10748.98s]  because we're looking for...
[10748.98s -> 10751.98s]  Who was an actual boss in Sekiro?
[10751.98s -> 10767.13s]  I'm actually going to turn this off.
[10767.17s -> 10770.17s]  Because there was so many mini bosses in Sekiro.
[10770.17s -> 10771.17s]  All right.
[10771.17s -> 10772.17s]  All right.
[10772.17s -> 10773.79s]  All right.
[10773.79s -> 10783.84s]  So we're looking for the names that are orange.
[10783.84s -> 10785.02s]  So it's not very money.
[10785.02s -> 10787.09s]  Owl.
[10787.09s -> 10788.09s]  I didn't do Owl.
[10788.09s -> 10789.09s]  I don't think I fought that.
[10789.09s -> 10793.25s]  That's going to have to go immediately down there.
[10793.25s -> 10794.25s]  I don't know.
[10794.25s -> 10795.55s]  I don't think I did that.
[10795.55s -> 10798.78s]  Demon of Hatred.
[10798.78s -> 10799.78s]  I don't know if I did.
[10799.78s -> 10800.78s]  Did I do that?
[10800.78s -> 10807.71s]  Chained Ogre is not...
[10807.71s -> 10808.71s]  All right.
[10808.71s -> 10809.71s]  This is the first fight here.
[10809.71s -> 10814.70s]  This is the one that you die.
[10814.70s -> 10815.70s]  It's the tutorial one.
[10815.74s -> 10816.74s]  Do I really count it?
[10816.74s -> 10821.27s]  This is the beginning of the game.
[10821.27s -> 10823.83s]  Demon was awful for you.
[10823.83s -> 10826.83s]  I feel like every one of these bosses, I was furious.
[10826.83s -> 10829.83s]  So I don't know how to even rate these.
[10829.83s -> 10830.83s]  I hated these.
[10830.83s -> 10834.61s]  The Owl was a story boss.
[10834.61s -> 10836.61s]  Did I hate everything in Sekiro?
[10836.61s -> 10839.58s]  No, I like...
[10839.58s -> 10840.58s]  No, no, no.
[10840.58s -> 10842.20s]  That's when everything was burning down.
[10842.20s -> 10845.04s]  Okay.
[10845.04s -> 10850.57s]  Let me see if I know where it is.
[10850.57s -> 10851.57s]  That's where the whole...
[10851.57s -> 10852.57s]  Everything's burning down.
[10852.57s -> 10857.54s]  I remember the ape was Owl.
[10857.54s -> 10860.00s]  Owl.
[10860.00s -> 10862.39s]  Isn't it where everything's burning?
[10862.39s -> 10875.75s]  Or is that a different fight?
[10875.79s -> 10876.79s]  Oh, no.
[10876.79s -> 10877.79s]  I did do this one.
[10877.79s -> 10878.79s]  Did I?
[10878.79s -> 10887.84s]  Yeah, there's two.
[10887.84s -> 10888.84s]  It was fun.
[10888.84s -> 10889.84s]  You had to do this.
[10889.84s -> 10892.49s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10892.49s -> 10893.49s]  That one was fun.
[10893.49s -> 10894.49s]  Okay, what else do we need to see?
[10894.49s -> 10897.43s]  We need to see pretty much all the major fights, which are...
[10897.43s -> 10900.38s]  I don't think that's a major one.
[10900.38s -> 10901.38s]  Lady Butterfly.
[10901.38s -> 10902.38s]  Let me remember this.
[10902.38s -> 10903.38s]  Oh, I remember Lady Butterfly.
[10903.38s -> 10904.38s]  You know how I know Lady Butterfly?
[10904.38s -> 10906.26s]  Here's how I know.
[10906.26s -> 10911.75s]  Every time I've tried to replay Sekiro, I've only beaten Sekiro one time.
[10911.75s -> 10915.75s]  I always get to this point, lose like a dozen times in a row, and go,
[10915.75s -> 10919.91s]  fuck this game and uninstall it.
[10919.95s -> 10926.74s]  And I've tried at least probably three or four times.
[10926.74s -> 10927.74s]  All right, so this...
[10927.74s -> 10928.74s]  How do I even rate these?
[10928.74s -> 10929.74s]  I hate...
[10929.74s -> 10931.30s]  Did I hate this game?
[10931.30s -> 10932.30s]  There's the bull.
[10932.30s -> 10933.30s]  I remember the bull.
[10933.30s -> 10941.83s]  This was crazy, but it was kind of a cool fight.
[10941.83s -> 10944.15s]  I remember that.
[10944.15s -> 10945.15s]  These are all mini bosses.
[10945.15s -> 10950.97s]  Okay, I remember that one.
[10950.97s -> 10955.09s]  Right?
[10955.09s -> 10956.72s]  This is the...
[10956.72s -> 10957.72s]  Inichiro, right?
[10957.72s -> 10961.80s]  This is the first time you fight it.
[10961.80s -> 10962.80s]  Hard equals bad?
[10962.80s -> 10963.80s]  I didn't say that.
[10963.80s -> 10971.96s]  He turns into lightning moves, doesn't he?
[10971.96s -> 10974.04s]  Yeah.
[10974.04s -> 10983.73s]  This fight was actually pretty cool.
[10984.17s -> 10985.17s]  Watch yourself play this game.
[10985.17s -> 10986.17s]  I don't know, man.
[10986.17s -> 10989.20s]  I remember this.
[10989.20s -> 10990.20s]  This is F.
[10990.20s -> 10991.20s]  This is the monkey one.
[10991.20s -> 10992.20s]  We had to run around.
[10992.20s -> 10993.38s]  This is F.
[10993.38s -> 10994.38s]  This actually might be below Bed of Chaos.
[10994.38s -> 10997.51s]  Yeah, this is lower than Bed of Chaos.
[10997.51s -> 11004.94s]  I don't even know if I would count...
[11004.94s -> 11009.22s]  Yeah, this is when you run around and they're all invisible.
[11009.22s -> 11011.22s]  It's just like not even a boss fight.
[11011.22s -> 11014.38s]  It's just stupid.
[11014.38s -> 11015.38s]  Is the Great Serpent even a fight?
[11015.38s -> 11017.82s]  Don't you kind of just run away from it?
[11017.82s -> 11026.74s]  It's not a fight.
[11026.74s -> 11028.49s]  Really cool, though.
[11028.49s -> 11029.49s]  Probably the coolest part of the game.
[11029.49s -> 11030.49s]  One of the coolest parts.
[11030.49s -> 11034.80s]  Yeah.
[11034.80s -> 11035.80s]  The ape.
[11037.70s -> 11042.54s]  The Guardian Ape, aka the Twitch streamer reaction compilation fight.
[11042.54s -> 11046.91s]  Where, no!
[11046.91s -> 11047.91s]  What?
[11047.91s -> 11048.91s]  He's getting up!
[11048.91s -> 11049.91s]  No!
[11049.91s -> 11053.84s]  What the fuck?
[11053.84s -> 11058.22s]  Dude!
[11058.22s -> 11063.17s]  It's actually cool, though.
[11063.17s -> 11067.14s]  I think this should be somewhere at least in A.
[11067.14s -> 11068.14s]  It's a really cool fight.
[11068.14s -> 11073.92s]  Yeah, because there's just the face cams in the corner.
[11073.92s -> 11075.92s]  What the fuck?
[11075.92s -> 11078.61s]  No, dude!
[11078.61s -> 11079.61s]  What?
[11079.61s -> 11083.34s]  Yeah.
[11083.34s -> 11086.06s]  I liked it, though.
[11086.06s -> 11087.06s]  This is the gimmick shit, right?
[11087.06s -> 11090.38s]  They throw the two at you at the same time.
[11090.46s -> 11092.46s]  I hate the fake YouTuber voice.
[11092.46s -> 11096.07s]  Yeah, I remember that.
[11096.07s -> 11099.02s]  This is not a real fight.
[11099.02s -> 11104.75s]  They put two at you at the same time, which is annoying.
[11104.75s -> 11106.70s]  Emma?
[11106.70s -> 11107.70s]  Why do I not remember this?
[11107.70s -> 11108.70s]  Oh, no.
[11108.70s -> 11110.70s]  Wait.
[11110.70s -> 11111.70s]  Did I fight this?
[11111.70s -> 11116.41s]  Wasn't there an ending you could get in Sekiro that was not even halfway through the game?
[11116.41s -> 11123.54s]  This is part of that, right?
[11123.54s -> 11124.97s]  Yeah.
[11124.97s -> 11130.21s]  I did not do any of these.
[11130.21s -> 11131.75s]  This is the one where everything's on fire?
[11131.75s -> 11133.57s]  No.
[11133.57s -> 11137.13s]  Am I just making up that I did that fight, or did I watch somebody else do it instead
[11137.13s -> 11143.87s]  that I did it?
[11143.87s -> 11152.55s]  I do remember the owl fight, though.
[11152.55s -> 11154.69s]  This fight.
[11154.85s -> 11156.41s]  I liked this one, actually.
[11156.41s -> 11164.08s]  This fight was cool.
[11164.08s -> 11165.72s]  This might be one of the best fights in the game.
[11165.72s -> 11178.06s]  Yeah, I loved this one.
[11178.06s -> 11180.17s]  This is when he jumps up in the tree.
[11180.17s -> 11181.17s]  Yeah, no.
[11181.17s -> 11185.48s]  It's cool.
[11185.48s -> 11186.48s]  This is another bull.
[11186.48s -> 11189.83s]  It's a mini boss.
[11189.83s -> 11190.83s]  Oh, yeah.
[11190.83s -> 11191.83s]  The big fish.
[11191.83s -> 11197.22s]  I wouldn't classify this as a boss, either.
[11197.22s -> 11207.46s]  I wonder how unfair I am to Sekiro.
[11207.46s -> 11210.15s]  That's not a boss, though.
[11210.15s -> 11211.47s]  Old Dragons of the Tree.
[11211.47s -> 11214.58s]  Oh, everybody made fun of me for this one.
[11214.58s -> 11216.82s]  They said this is the easiest boss in the game, and I couldn't do it.
[11216.82s -> 11220.17s]  I remember this.
[11220.17s -> 11222.57s]  I remember people were like, oh, Megalol, like, he can't do it.
[11222.57s -> 11224.21s]  This is the easiest fight in the whole game.
[11224.21s -> 11231.53s]  Why don't you go up on, like, pillars and shit, and they throw lightning at you?
[11231.53s -> 11234.62s]  No, this is different.
[11234.62s -> 11237.18s]  This is just a Deacon fight.
[11237.18s -> 11240.30s]  Which always goes to D, at least.
[11240.30s -> 11241.66s]  This is the one, the Divine Dragon.
[11241.66s -> 11253.65s]  Everyone made fun of me for this.
[11253.65s -> 11257.10s]  Yeah, this is cool.
[11257.10s -> 11265.02s]  Even if the fight's easy, this is really, really cool.
[11265.02s -> 11267.70s]  I remember being awe-inspired by this one.
[11267.70s -> 11270.60s]  It's beautiful.
[11270.60s -> 11272.54s]  Yep.
[11272.54s -> 11273.54s]  Oh, these are mini-bosses.
[11273.54s -> 11280.03s]  Is he even of hatred?
[11280.03s -> 11281.03s]  Yeah, I...
[11281.03s -> 11282.03s]  Yeah, I remember.
[11282.15s -> 11288.42s]  I'm getting flashbacks.
[11288.42s -> 11297.35s]  This fight did suck, though.
[11297.35s -> 11298.35s]  This fight was bad.
[11298.35s -> 11302.49s]  Did we get a raid?
[11302.49s -> 11304.50s]  Did we?
[11304.50s -> 11306.25s]  We did get a raid.
[11306.25s -> 11309.22s]  Atriarch!
[11309.22s -> 11311.42s]  What's up?
[11311.42s -> 11313.90s]  We're doing a very long, painstaking thing.
[11313.90s -> 11315.52s]  Welcome, everybody.
[11315.52s -> 11319.50s]  I hope you had a good stream, Atriarch.
[11319.50s -> 11324.26s]  We are trying to rate every single boss across every single From Software game.
[11324.26s -> 11327.95s]  I've been here for about four hours.
[11327.95s -> 11330.60s]  Is it tough?
[11330.60s -> 11332.16s]  I have not done Dark Souls 2 yet.
[11332.16s -> 11335.30s]  We're in the middle of doing Sekiro.
[11335.30s -> 11339.22s]  Dark Souls 2 is going to be the hardest, and in fact, I might just like...
[11339.22s -> 11340.22s]  I don't know.
[11340.22s -> 11342.10s]  It's...
[11342.10s -> 11348.60s]  There's so many bosses in Dark Souls 2.
[11348.60s -> 11351.76s]  I feel like every boss in Dark Souls 2, for me, is the same boss.
[11351.76s -> 11355.88s]  I don't know why.
[11355.88s -> 11363.96s]  I remember the Pursuer, and you shoot him with the bow and arrow thing.
[11363.96s -> 11364.96s]  I'll do it.
[11364.96s -> 11367.42s]  I'll do it.
[11367.42s -> 11368.42s]  It's not going to take that long.
[11368.42s -> 11371.18s]  But yeah, we're going over, getting refreshers on what the bosses were, so I can remember
[11371.18s -> 11372.18s]  if I hated them.
[11372.18s -> 11375.49s]  Hated this one.
[11375.49s -> 11376.98s]  And then...
[11376.98s -> 11379.06s]  This...
[11379.06s -> 11380.06s]  This fight.
[11380.06s -> 11383.34s]  Yeah.
[11383.34s -> 11388.69s]  I cried during this fight, didn't I?
[11388.69s -> 11390.14s]  I'm pretty sure I cried.
[11390.14s -> 11391.74s]  I think I actually cried on camera.
[11391.74s -> 11398.02s]  Yeah, I think so.
[11398.02s -> 11400.98s]  I think this took me like 60 to 70 attempts.
[11400.98s -> 11401.98s]  I cried on camera.
[11401.98s -> 11409.24s]  Alright, I got a good idea.
[11409.24s -> 11411.00s]  I've got an understanding for Sekiro.
[11411.00s -> 11414.74s]  Sad, really.
[11414.74s -> 11417.97s]  It's going to be sad, really.
[11417.97s -> 11425.09s]  Because I don't think...
[11425.09s -> 11428.25s]  Scary music.
[11428.25s -> 11438.22s]  I don't think there's anything in S or A in Sekiro.
[11438.22s -> 11439.22s]  I don't think so.
[11439.22s -> 11442.19s]  We'll find out.
[11442.19s -> 11451.29s]  Here we go.
[11451.29s -> 11456.84s]  So, okay, can I put this into like, I cried...
[11456.84s -> 11459.16s]  The fight is awesome.
[11459.16s -> 11461.22s]  It's such an amazing fight.
[11461.22s -> 11462.84s]  It's so beautiful.
[11462.84s -> 11464.56s]  And it's so...
[11464.56s -> 11466.04s]  The moves are so cool.
[11466.04s -> 11469.28s]  It's such a dance, but my god, I cried on camera.
[11469.28s -> 11474.99s]  Like, I fucking cried.
[11474.99s -> 11477.77s]  There were a stream of tears.
[11477.77s -> 11481.53s]  And I was like, I QUIT STREAMING, I QUIT STREAMING, I QUIT STREAMING!
[11481.53s -> 11482.53s]  And then I was like, calm down.
[11482.53s -> 11484.97s]  And I was like, I FUCKING QUIT STREAMING, and I turned the stream off, and I didn't
[11484.97s -> 11485.97s]  come back for like a week.
[11485.97s -> 11491.09s]  I never thought I'd quit.
[11491.09s -> 11500.94s]  No, I can't put it up...
[11500.94s -> 11502.46s]  I fucking cried.
[11502.46s -> 11509.98s]  I'm gonna keep it there.
[11509.98s -> 11525.50s]  Um, Guardian Ape is gonna be A. I think.
[11525.50s -> 11527.50s]  I don't know if we're gonna get any S from Sekiro.
[11527.50s -> 11533.52s]  It was just too fucking hard.
[11533.52s -> 11541.12s]  Lady Butterfly, F. Because even Hatred is D. Owl is not...
[11541.12s -> 11549.48s]  Lady Butterfly is F. Because you keep preventing me from doing another playthrough.
[11549.48s -> 11551.00s]  The only reason.
[11551.00s -> 11552.00s]  I keep...
[11552.00s -> 11555.88s]  I've tried to play Sekiro, and I get to Lady Butterfly, and I go, why am I doing this?
[11555.88s -> 11556.88s]  I don't want to do it.
[11556.88s -> 11557.88s]  So that's...
[11557.88s -> 11558.88s]  You have to be there.
[11558.88s -> 11563.86s]  Like, you keep preventing me from playing the game.
[11563.86s -> 11565.18s]  This was actually awesome, though.
[11565.18s -> 11568.64s]  So this, let's be fair.
[11568.64s -> 11569.84s]  Lightning moves...
[11569.84s -> 11571.28s]  That's probably better than...
[11571.28s -> 11572.28s]  That's bet...
[11572.28s -> 11577.36s]  I'm sorry, it is.
[11577.36s -> 11579.24s]  Better than Pontiff Sullivan.
[11579.24s -> 11580.24s]  That was a crazy fight.
[11580.24s -> 11585.10s]  It was so intense.
[11585.10s -> 11590.93s]  Why is Butterfly lower than Pinwheel?
[11590.93s -> 11597.71s]  I never said it was gonna be perfect.
[11597.71s -> 11601.77s]  Okay.
[11601.77s -> 11602.77s]  I didn't...
[11602.77s -> 11606.76s]  I couldn't do this one.
[11606.76s -> 11607.76s]  True Corrupted Monk.
[11607.76s -> 11608.94s]  Oh!
[11608.94s -> 11609.94s]  That's the good one.
[11609.94s -> 11610.94s]  Yep.
[11610.94s -> 11611.94s]  That's the good one.
[11615.86s -> 11623.62s]  B.
[11623.62s -> 11630.05s]  Monkeys.
[11630.05s -> 11631.05s]  F.
[11631.05s -> 11632.05s]  Which one of these is the real one?
[11632.05s -> 11635.14s]  Corrupted Monk?
[11635.14s -> 11636.70s]  Over...
[11636.70s -> 11637.70s]  That's the one I'm thinking of, right?
[11637.70s -> 11638.70s]  The right one?
[11638.70s -> 11658.62s]  I like that.
[11658.62s -> 11662.30s]  These weren't really bosses, and if we're not doing mini-bosses, then I have to...
[11662.30s -> 11663.30s]  I can't put them in.
[11663.30s -> 11666.52s]  Corrupted...
[11666.52s -> 11667.52s]  No.
[11667.52s -> 11670.30s]  That's a different game.
[11670.30s -> 11671.30s]  This is...
[11671.30s -> 11672.30s]  The...
[11672.30s -> 11673.30s]  Tutorial.
[11673.30s -> 11674.54s]  Genichiro.
[11674.54s -> 11676.61s]  Which...
[11676.61s -> 11677.61s]  I don't know if I can even place this.
[11677.61s -> 11678.61s]  C?
[11678.61s -> 11681.04s]  No, you're just supposed to die.
[11681.04s -> 11682.04s]  I'm not gonna place it.
[11682.04s -> 11684.81s]  Genichiro's already up there.
[11691.38s -> 11693.33s]  Who is...
[11693.33s -> 11694.33s]  Gyobu?
[11694.33s -> 11702.29s]  Gyobu.
[11702.29s -> 11703.29s]  Who's Gyobu?
[11703.29s -> 11714.88s]  Gyobu?
[11714.88s -> 11715.88s]  That's the final Genichiro.
[11715.88s -> 11716.88s]  Oh!
[11716.88s -> 11719.08s]  It's the guy on the horse!
[11719.08s -> 11720.08s]  Okay.
[11720.08s -> 11721.08s]  Now that was cool.
[11721.08s -> 11723.28s]  I actually liked that one.
[11723.28s -> 11738.34s]  A lot.
[11738.34s -> 11739.34s]  That one's B.
[11739.34s -> 11741.16s]  I liked that one.
[11741.16s -> 11742.16s]  It was cool.
[11742.16s -> 11743.16s]  I don't think it's A, but it's definitely B.
[11743.16s -> 11749.33s]  Low...
[11749.33s -> 11750.33s]  Mid-B.
[11750.33s -> 11753.04s]  This doesn't need to be an I don't know section, then.
[11753.04s -> 11757.64s]  Genichiro Way of Tomo is the final version when he transforms mid-fight.
[11757.64s -> 11760.16s]  Ah...
[11760.16s -> 11763.19s]  Okay.
[11763.19s -> 11776.86s]  That's the one I like.
[11776.86s -> 11781.14s]  This is the tutorial one, right?
[11781.26s -> 11782.50s]  I don't want to fuck up Dark Souls 2.
[11782.50s -> 11785.21s]  We're almost done.
[11785.21s -> 11786.21s]  Headless Ape.
[11786.21s -> 11787.21s]  We're in a Corrupted Monk there.
[11787.21s -> 11788.21s]  These are mini-bosses, right?
[11788.21s -> 11791.14s]  Oh, these are the ones where you...
[11791.14s -> 11792.14s]  Okay, I think we're done.
[11792.14s -> 11793.58s]  Oh, Divine Dragon.
[11793.58s -> 11796.03s]  Right, Divine Dragon.
[11796.03s -> 11798.30s]  Beautiful.
[11798.30s -> 11800.69s]  Beautiful fight.
[11800.69s -> 11803.46s]  Not an A, though.
[11803.46s -> 11809.31s]  All right.
[11809.31s -> 11810.31s]  No S's in Sekiro.
[11810.31s -> 11814.34s]  No S's in Sekiro.
[11814.34s -> 11816.35s]  Sorry.
[11816.35s -> 11818.59s]  No Dark Souls 1S and no Sekiro S.
[11818.59s -> 11819.59s]  Those are my least favorite games, then.
[11819.59s -> 11820.59s]  They have to be.
[11820.59s -> 11821.59s]  And let's build Dark Souls 2.
[11821.59s -> 11822.59s]  It might be like...
[11822.59s -> 11830.74s]  I know a lot of people really like Dark Souls 2.
[11830.74s -> 11831.74s]  Dark Souls 2 for me.
[11831.74s -> 11836.69s]  These are kind of like the left side of the Monopoly map.
[11836.69s -> 11838.29s]  These are not really worth that much to me.
[11838.29s -> 11839.91s]  You know what I mean?
[11839.91s -> 11843.70s]  It's like these are all Baltic Avenues.
[11843.70s -> 11844.70s]  I don't...
[11844.70s -> 11849.58s]  I don't...
[11849.58s -> 11852.14s]  These are like, you know, Park Place, Boardwalk.
[11852.14s -> 11853.14s]  Up here.
[11853.14s -> 11854.14s]  But I don't know.
[11854.14s -> 11855.14s]  To me, these are all just Baltic Avenue.
[11855.14s -> 11859.46s]  Let's see, though.
[11859.46s -> 11865.67s]  I'm not going to talk shit until I do it, because that's the finale.
[11865.67s -> 11867.87s]  And then when I do that, I'm going to make sure it looks right.
[11867.87s -> 11870.63s]  And then I'm going to see what my favorite game for real is.
[11870.63s -> 11871.63s]  No bullshit.
[11871.63s -> 11872.63s]  Because you...
[11872.63s -> 11873.63s]  Let me...
[11873.63s -> 11875.38s]  Without looking.
[11875.38s -> 11876.38s]  Let me just tell you.
[11876.46s -> 11878.78s]  Not T-Rex, but like, this is where the games sit.
[11878.78s -> 11883.78s]  Epic.
[11883.78s -> 11886.60s]  Bloodborne, number one.
[11886.60s -> 11890.25s]  Elden Ring, number two.
[11890.25s -> 11891.94s]  Wait.
[11891.94s -> 11902.46s]  Let me start backwards.
[11902.46s -> 11904.85s]  Dark Souls 2, bottom.
[11904.85s -> 11907.05s]  Sekiro, just over that.
[11907.05s -> 11911.44s]  Dark Souls 1, just over that.
[11911.44s -> 11914.30s]  Dark Souls 3, over that.
[11914.30s -> 11915.54s]  Wait.
[11915.54s -> 11916.54s]  Wait.
[11916.54s -> 11918.54s]  I need to write it out.
[11918.54s -> 11937.01s]  This is my, like, you know, like, stupid fucking list.
[11937.01s -> 11938.01s]  Demon's Souls.
[11938.01s -> 11942.98s]  Dark Souls 1.
[11942.98s -> 11946.27s]  Zero.
[11946.27s -> 11947.27s]  Okay.
[11947.27s -> 11953.01s]  This is what my list looks like at the moment right now.
[11953.01s -> 11955.78s]  This is really scary.
[11955.78s -> 11956.78s]  Whatever it is.
[11956.78s -> 11964.38s]  Is Elden Ring better than Bloodborne?
[11964.38s -> 11965.98s]  They're the same to me.
[11965.98s -> 11966.98s]  In my head right now, I can't decide.
[11966.98s -> 11972.76s]  Done.
[11972.76s -> 11975.51s]  So that's what I think.
[11975.51s -> 11979.38s]  We're going to find out if it's real.
[11979.38s -> 11980.38s]  Sekiro is done.
[11980.38s -> 11987.38s]  Let me just check.
[11987.38s -> 12020.58s]  This is such a huge wall to cross, though.
[12020.58s -> 12023.26s]  High B. It's not Lagarius.
[12023.26s -> 12037.37s]  It's not.
[12037.37s -> 12038.37s]  God damn it.
[12038.37s -> 12047.48s]  I don't know.
[12047.48s -> 12048.48s]  I think this has to be there.
[12048.48s -> 12049.48s]  I think that's actually accurate.
[12049.48s -> 12054.86s]  Because it's better than Lagarius.
[12054.86s -> 12066.02s]  It's better than Abyss Watchers.
[12066.02s -> 12067.02s]  Cry-Card is...
[12067.02s -> 12115.35s]  No, is he?
[12115.35s -> 12116.35s]  Dark Souls 2 is the only thing left.
[12116.35s -> 12123.14s]  Why is there an open can of food on your shelf?
[12123.14s -> 12134.80s]  There's no open can of food with a fork sticking out of it.
[12134.80s -> 12138.36s]  We're almost there.
[12138.36s -> 12142.42s]  Dark Souls 2.
[12142.42s -> 12145.77s]  You guys ready?
[12145.77s -> 12146.93s]  Find out how much we like this game.
[12146.93s -> 12156.98s]  Here we go.
[12156.98s -> 12159.44s]  Giant.
[12159.44s -> 12163.91s]  I remember the giant.
[12163.91s -> 12164.99s]  Actually not that bad.
[12164.99s -> 12171.22s]  It's a pretty good intro.
[12171.22s -> 12175.79s]  Pursuer.
[12175.79s -> 12179.39s]  You can kill the Pursuer in, like, two seconds if you shoot the crossbow at him.
[12179.39s -> 12183.46s]  I like the Pursuer because he chases you around.
[12183.46s -> 12184.46s]  He shows up a bunch of times.
[12185.14s -> 12186.96s]  It's alright.
[12186.96s -> 12187.96s]  Dragon Rider.
[12187.96s -> 12188.96s]  Oh, this is the joke.
[12188.96s -> 12189.96s]  Laugh out loud.
[12189.96s -> 12190.96s]  You make him fall off.
[12190.96s -> 12194.25s]  That's a C.
[12194.25s -> 12195.25s]  Old Dragon Slayer.
[12195.25s -> 12205.58s]  I don't even remember fighting this guy.
[12205.58s -> 12206.58s]  I don't...
[12206.58s -> 12210.14s]  There's so many bosses in Dark Souls 2, I don't even remember fighting them.
[12210.14s -> 12213.34s]  It looks alright.
[12213.34s -> 12219.59s]  Oh, this thing was cool.
[12219.59s -> 12220.59s]  It was the sentry.
[12220.59s -> 12223.78s]  It has the two bodies.
[12223.78s -> 12224.78s]  This fight was good.
[12224.78s -> 12231.39s]  Okay, Ruin Sentinel.
[12231.39s -> 12233.19s]  This is an F. I remember this was stupid.
[12233.19s -> 12234.19s]  I hated this.
[12234.19s -> 12238.63s]  The F, for sure.
[12238.67s -> 12242.94s]  The Ruin Sentinels are absolutely F.
[12242.94s -> 12244.74s]  Belfry Gargoyles?
[12244.74s -> 12245.92s]  F.
[12245.92s -> 12247.52s]  Is it literally just Dark Souls 1?
[12247.52s -> 12254.52s]  Is it F?
[12254.52s -> 12257.36s]  Okay.
[12257.36s -> 12258.36s]  The Lost Sinner.
[12258.36s -> 12263.59s]  I didn't even fight this guy.
[12263.59s -> 12264.59s]  He looks...
[12264.59s -> 12272.51s]  What about the Skeleton Lords?
[12272.51s -> 12273.51s]  This looks like shit.
[12273.51s -> 12274.51s]  I don't know...
[12274.51s -> 12275.51s]  I think this one sucks too.
[12275.51s -> 12278.35s]  What about the...
[12278.35s -> 12281.35s]  What about Slimer from Ghostbusters?
[12281.35s -> 12283.19s]  I actually remember this fight.
[12283.19s -> 12284.19s]  This fight was fun.
[12284.19s -> 12286.90s]  This fight was fun.
[12286.90s -> 12287.90s]  Yup.
[12287.90s -> 12293.50s]  I liked Slimer.
[12293.50s -> 12294.50s]  This is probably a C.
[12296.95s -> 12303.78s]  Why do these all look like they're in the same exact area?
[12303.78s -> 12305.78s]  This one actually was pretty good.
[12305.78s -> 12311.92s]  That boss is bozo shit.
[12311.92s -> 12315.02s]  This one's pretty good.
[12315.02s -> 12320.50s]  Yeah, I remember the scream and dodging.
[12320.50s -> 12321.50s]  Yup.
[12321.50s -> 12323.06s]  That was fun.
[12323.06s -> 12327.92s]  I'm not seeing any A's that I remember as being like, holy shit, that's an A.
[12327.92s -> 12328.92s]  Smelter Demon.
[12328.92s -> 12348.14s]  This is bozo shit right here.
[12348.14s -> 12350.14s]  Oh, I thought he died.
[12350.14s -> 12354.56s]  This is actually cool.
[12354.56s -> 12355.56s]  Yup, I remember this.
[12355.56s -> 12359.13s]  This is probably a B.
[12359.13s -> 12361.13s]  Smelter Demon and Old Iron King.
[12361.13s -> 12368.40s]  This is the fight I'm talking about where you can fall in.
[12368.40s -> 12374.61s]  Yeah, this one sucks.
[12374.61s -> 12381.61s]  D.
[12381.61s -> 12383.36s]  Executioner's Chariot.
[12383.36s -> 12386.56s]  Oh yeah, the Chariot fight.
[12386.56s -> 12392.36s]  Dude, playing Dark Souls 2, it feels like it was a dream.
[12392.36s -> 12394.36s]  I don't remember any of these things.
[12394.36s -> 12396.36s]  And I didn't even play it that long ago.
[12396.36s -> 12403.30s]  Art equals bad.
[12403.30s -> 12404.30s]  Looks like shit.
[12404.30s -> 12405.30s]  Bozo shit.
[12405.30s -> 12406.30s]  Didn't fight him.
[12406.30s -> 12414.32s]  DLC?
[12414.32s -> 12415.32s]  What?
[12415.32s -> 12416.32s]  You should replay it.
[12416.32s -> 12417.32s]  I don't know if I want to.
[12417.32s -> 12419.97s]  I feel like I'll hate it.
[12419.97s -> 12420.97s]  I think it's D.
[12420.97s -> 12429.33s]  I do have a pretty strong memory of this one.
[12429.33s -> 12431.63s]  I think this fight was cool.
[12431.63s -> 12434.24s]  It was probably like a B.
[12434.24s -> 12435.24s]  It was pretty fun.
[12435.24s -> 12442.11s]  Scorpion was kind of like the queen from the first game.
[12442.11s -> 12443.35s]  Yup.
[12443.35s -> 12444.35s]  Royal Rat Authority.
[12444.35s -> 12447.70s]  What?
[12447.70s -> 12452.34s]  That's a dog.
[12452.34s -> 12453.34s]  That's not a rat?
[12453.34s -> 12459.30s]  I thought Royal Rat Authority was a bunch of rats in the room.
[12459.30s -> 12464.23s]  Did I play Dark Souls 2?
[12464.23s -> 12467.20s]  That's the other one.
[12467.20s -> 12468.20s]  Oh, okay.
[12468.20s -> 12470.82s]  Well, that's a fun dog.
[12470.82s -> 12471.82s]  Fowling Magus.
[12471.82s -> 12482.30s]  This looks kind of like some Bozo shit right here.
[12482.30s -> 12493.62s]  The Duke's Deer Freya.
[12493.62s -> 12496.70s]  Is this the one with the...
[12496.70s -> 12497.70s]  It's the spider.
[12497.70s -> 12498.70s]  Yeah, this one was really scary.
[12498.70s -> 12506.57s]  I like the design of this boss.
[12506.57s -> 12509.74s]  This boss needs to be higher than the armor spider.
[12509.74s -> 12512.74s]  Otherwise, I pretended to play this game.
[12512.74s -> 12516.22s]  Which I didn't.
[12516.22s -> 12517.22s]  I beat it like three times.
[12517.22s -> 12518.46s]  Ah, here it is.
[12518.46s -> 12519.46s]  Royal Rat Vanguard.
[12519.46s -> 12523.46s]  I like the room.
[12523.46s -> 12525.46s]  I remember fighting these and the room is cool.
[12525.46s -> 12530.87s]  I'm not going to give it an S because of rats.
[12530.87s -> 12532.87s]  I'll give it probably like a C.
[12532.87s -> 12535.01s]  Rotten.
[12535.01s -> 12541.82s]  Whoa.
[12541.82s -> 12542.82s]  Oh, yeah.
[12542.82s -> 12550.07s]  This fight.
[12550.07s -> 12552.07s]  I mean, it's kind of Bozo, but it's...
[12552.07s -> 12554.50s]  I would say it's probably high.
[12554.50s -> 12555.50s]  Not that high.
[12555.50s -> 12559.96s]  I'm trying to find the one that I'm like, yeah, yep.
[12559.96s -> 12560.96s]  That one is definitely like A.
[12560.96s -> 12565.89s]  Two Dragon Riders.
[12565.89s -> 12566.89s]  That's not it.
[12566.89s -> 12575.32s]  I don't think that's it.
[12575.32s -> 12577.32s]  I know for a fact a few of these I thought were really good.
[12577.32s -> 12580.78s]  Maybe this is one of them.
[12580.78s -> 12581.78s]  Looking Glass Knight.
[12581.78s -> 12595.30s]  I have a distinct memory of this guy's shield and me being like, that was fun.
[12595.30s -> 12600.95s]  Okay.
[12600.95s -> 12602.95s]  I'm looking for one that wows me.
[12602.95s -> 12604.51s]  It's this one.
[12604.51s -> 12606.51s]  This is the one with the fucking skull in the mouth of the big frog.
[12606.51s -> 12607.51s]  Yep.
[12607.51s -> 12609.51s]  We finally found at least our B.
[12609.51s -> 12617.60s]  Most people give this an F.
[12617.60s -> 12622.60s]  I give this a B because the design is really, really just carries it completely.
[12622.60s -> 12628.31s]  Actually, so far, design wise, the only like interesting looking boss in the whole game
[12628.31s -> 12629.31s]  so far.
[12629.31s -> 12631.74s]  Everyone else is kind of just like a...
[12631.74s -> 12632.74s]  Besides the spider.
[12632.74s -> 12638.53s]  I don't know.
[12638.53s -> 12639.53s]  Dark Souls 2 is huge though.
[12639.53s -> 12643.82s]  This is so much content.
[12643.82s -> 12645.82s]  This is the Bell Stat?
[12645.82s -> 12646.82s]  Royal Ages.
[12646.82s -> 12661.94s]  I just don't have any memory of fighting this.
[12661.94s -> 12663.94s]  Dark Souls 2 is just like a billion guys in armor.
[12663.94s -> 12668.98s]  Dark Souls 2 is one of the biggest games they have though.
[12668.98s -> 12670.98s]  So there's a lot of content.
[12670.98s -> 12672.15s]  The areas in Dark Souls 2.
[12672.15s -> 12673.15s]  Some of them are really cool.
[12673.15s -> 12675.35s]  All right.
[12675.35s -> 12679.86s]  He's all right.
[12679.86s -> 12680.86s]  Oh, the dragon in the cage.
[12680.86s -> 12681.86s]  This thing.
[12681.86s -> 12682.86s]  Okay.
[12682.86s -> 12687.36s]  This is high.
[12687.36s -> 12690.36s]  This is high because you get to see this from a distance for a while and you go, holy shit.
[12690.36s -> 12691.36s]  Do I actually have to go in there?
[12691.36s -> 12693.94s]  Yeah.
[12693.94s -> 12701.69s]  This is probably at least a B.
[12701.69s -> 12702.69s]  Ancient dragon.
[12702.69s -> 12707.38s]  Oh yeah.
[12707.38s -> 12708.38s]  That's right.
[12708.38s -> 12709.38s]  You can just come up.
[12709.38s -> 12710.38s]  Oh, you can't kill this.
[12710.38s -> 12713.14s]  This takes way too long.
[12713.14s -> 12717.04s]  Don't you have to cheese this fight?
[12717.04s -> 12718.04s]  Isn't this impossible?
[12718.04s -> 12739.18s]  I don't.
[12739.18s -> 12741.18s]  I don't want to just hate on Dark Souls 2.
[12741.18s -> 12742.18s]  I really don't.
[12742.18s -> 12745.38s]  I don't want to be like that.
[12745.38s -> 12751.93s]  But doesn't Dark Souls 2 look like it came before Dark Souls 1?
[12751.93s -> 12761.40s]  Is he alive?
[12761.40s -> 12764.40s]  I enjoyed myself a lot in the game.
[12764.40s -> 12766.64s]  I don't want to pretend like I didn't.
[12766.64s -> 12769.86s]  Right?
[12769.86s -> 12770.86s]  Giant Lord?
[12770.86s -> 12777.79s]  It's so simple to sit here and be like, you know, Dark Souls 2 is the worst one.
[12778.79s -> 12783.25s]  But I mean, do you want more from software content?
[12783.25s -> 12785.25s]  Would you rather this game didn't exist?
[12785.25s -> 12788.41s]  Be honest.
[12788.41s -> 12791.80s]  No, I'll keep it.
[12791.80s -> 12793.80s]  The alternative is this does not exist.
[12793.80s -> 12797.47s]  I remember these giants there.
[12797.47s -> 12798.47s]  They were kind of annoying.
[12798.47s -> 12799.65s]  King Vendrick.
[12799.65s -> 12808.38s]  This one's not bad.
[12808.38s -> 12814.58s]  This is how I got into Dark Souls?
[12814.58s -> 12816.40s]  Yeah.
[12816.40s -> 12823.69s]  So should that be the Dark Souls 2 section of our kind of map where they're all in C
[12823.69s -> 12825.69s]  and they're all in a row?
[12825.69s -> 12828.72s]  None of these are apps.
[12828.72s -> 12834.14s]  You know something?
[12834.14s -> 12840.15s]  Guys, Dark Souls 2 has no S's and has no A's.
[12840.15s -> 12847.41s]  But it also has no F's.
[12847.41s -> 12852.10s]  Interesting.
[12852.10s -> 12857.65s]  I don't remember any of these me being like, this game sucks.
[12857.65s -> 12859.65s]  That's a barometer you need to use.
[12859.65s -> 12863.95s]  Did you fight this enemy and say this game sucks?
[12863.95s -> 12864.95s]  Fix it.
[12864.95s -> 12876.78s]  I'm trying to remember.
[12876.78s -> 12882.86s]  Is this just forgettable?
[12882.86s -> 12884.86s]  I don't remember saying that this game sucks.
[12884.86s -> 12885.86s]  Fix the game.
[12885.86s -> 12886.86s]  The ruined sentinels.
[12886.86s -> 12887.86s]  Yeah, that's right.
[12887.86s -> 12893.38s]  They get one F.
[12893.38s -> 12896.38s]  Don't you feel like you're watching what we're watching in a dream right now?
[12896.38s -> 12899.38s]  Like this is a Dark Souls game that you made up in your head asleep.
[12899.38s -> 12905.46s]  Like the way the animations are and the way that it's being played.
[12905.46s -> 12908.46s]  I feel like I'm dreaming this.
[12908.46s -> 12915.78s]  This is what my brain would put together to say, hey, this is like a Souls game.
[12915.78s -> 12920.41s]  I don't know why.
[12920.41s -> 12921.78s]  Something about it.
[12921.78s -> 12924.78s]  It feels like uncanny but real at the same time.
[12924.78s -> 12942.09s]  Oh, this is the first time that I'm going to tell you I remember this a lot and it was really crazy.
[12942.09s -> 12946.18s]  Yep, this is one of the end game bosses.
[12946.18s -> 12950.47s]  This one's actually really cool.
[12950.47s -> 12952.10s]  Is it?
[12952.10s -> 12965.94s]  Do I just want to give Dark Souls 2 like a spot somewhere in A?
[12965.94s -> 12967.94s]  This is literally the final boss before a scholar.
[12967.94s -> 12977.36s]  Oh, is this the guy that looked like Lord Zed and he comes out of the ground?
[12977.36s -> 12978.36s]  It is, right?
[12978.36s -> 12980.75s]  Yep.
[12980.75s -> 12993.45s]  Yep.
[12993.45s -> 12996.93s]  Okay, that's not really good.
[12996.93s -> 12997.93s]  This is an F boss?
[12997.93s -> 13003.18s]  I don't think any of these are F.
[13003.18s -> 13004.18s]  I don't.
[13004.18s -> 13005.18s]  I think maybe one of them is.
[13005.18s -> 13017.10s]  Alessandra is an F. That's adorable.
[13017.10s -> 13027.09s]  Compare any of these to Dark Souls 3.
[13027.09s -> 13031.65s]  Yeah, but there was a lot of time in between.
[13031.65s -> 13033.91s]  That's kind of cool.
[13033.91s -> 13035.41s]  Grave robbers.
[13035.41s -> 13043.42s]  Why did Dark Souls 2 have so many just put three people in a room fights?
[13043.42s -> 13044.42s]  I don't remember this.
[13044.42s -> 13045.42s]  I would have hated this.
[13045.42s -> 13053.04s]  This is mega F.
[13053.04s -> 13063.32s]  Is this fights mega F?
[13063.32s -> 13066.07s]  Is it worse than Bed of Chaos?
[13066.07s -> 13074.44s]  Is this mega F?
[13074.44s -> 13075.44s]  What about the...
[13075.44s -> 13078.19s]  Where's the third person?
[13078.19s -> 13083.57s]  Where's the third player?
[13083.57s -> 13090.33s]  Where's Sarah the old explorer?
[13090.33s -> 13100.57s]  Where's this other person?
[13100.57s -> 13102.57s]  This does seem kind of omega F.
[13102.57s -> 13107.62s]  Okay, where's the third person?
[13107.62s -> 13121.05s]  Alright, what about the slumbering dragon?
[13121.05s -> 13126.19s]  This is cool.
[13126.19s -> 13132.74s]  I played so much Dark Souls 2 and looking back it may have had some of the worst fights.
[13132.74s -> 13135.45s]  Is it that?
[13135.45s -> 13136.45s]  Yeah, this is weird.
[13136.45s -> 13137.45s]  This feels kind of weird.
[13137.45s -> 13139.45s]  I don't remember Dark Souls 2 looking this terrible.
[13139.45s -> 13142.74s]  It wasn't.
[13142.74s -> 13143.91s]  It was fun.
[13143.91s -> 13144.91s]  Like, I liked it.
[13144.91s -> 13148.62s]  It wasn't this bad.
[13148.62s -> 13151.40s]  No.
[13151.40s -> 13153.96s]  No, we're being unfair.
[13153.96s -> 13159.34s]  I think we're being unfair.
[13159.34s -> 13161.77s]  This is without seeing the areas.
[13161.77s -> 13165.77s]  Some of Dark Souls 2's areas are really, really cool and really majestic and awesome looking.
[13165.77s -> 13168.26s]  I don't think this is Copium.
[13168.26s -> 13170.26s]  I think it was actually a really fun game.
[13170.26s -> 13172.66s]  It was.
[13172.66s -> 13175.60s]  Dark Souls 2 never drops off in quality.
[13175.60s -> 13177.67s]  Let me read this.
[13177.67s -> 13184.81s]  Dark Souls 2 never drops off in quality is the second half of Dark Souls 1, you bozos.
[13184.81s -> 13190.44s]  That's actually a good point.
[13190.44s -> 13193.44s]  Like I said, there are not many Fs or Ds.
[13193.44s -> 13196.44s]  It's a bunch of Cs and Bs.
[13196.44s -> 13198.44s]  No Ss, no As, no Fs.
[13198.44s -> 13204.76s]  It's very consistent.
[13204.76s -> 13207.38s]  Even Elden Ring.
[13207.38s -> 13212.65s]  The last arc of Elden Ring was alright.
[13212.65s -> 13213.65s]  I mean, that was the whole thing.
[13213.65s -> 13216.65s]  The whole package was an unbelievable masterpiece.
[13216.65s -> 13221.69s]  It's consistently bad.
[13221.69s -> 13222.69s]  I don't think so.
[13222.69s -> 13224.86s]  What about the smelter demon?
[13224.86s -> 13230.88s]  You've already said three Fs.
[13230.88s -> 13244.63s]  Is it the Hollow Knight music in the background that's making this seem dumb?
[13244.63s -> 13246.38s]  I don't know.
[13246.38s -> 13247.38s]  What's going on?
[13247.38s -> 13255.38s]  It might be the music.
[13255.38s -> 13257.07s]  Oh, the Fume Knight.
[13257.07s -> 13258.07s]  I remember the Fume Knight.
[13258.07s -> 13265.56s]  Fume Knight was crazy.
[13265.56s -> 13273.62s]  What's going on with the health in Dark Souls 2?
[13273.62s -> 13280.01s]  What was that?
[13280.01s -> 13281.01s]  What's going on with this health?
[13281.01s -> 13291.63s]  Slow heal.
[13291.63s -> 13294.26s]  I remember this fight was actually pretty crazy.
[13294.26s -> 13296.26s]  I do remember this one.
[13296.26s -> 13298.26s]  Sir Alone.
[13298.26s -> 13302.38s]  This was fun too.
[13302.38s -> 13311.98s]  The timings on these were fun.
[13311.98s -> 13318.14s]  You know what it is about Dark Souls 2?
[13318.14s -> 13319.14s]  I figured it out.
[13319.14s -> 13321.96s]  There's no bodies in any of these suits.
[13321.96s -> 13324.65s]  It's all just metal.
[13324.65s -> 13325.65s]  Nobody's alive.
[13325.65s -> 13328.65s]  You're just metal suits attacking each other and clinking into each other.
[13328.65s -> 13333.79s]  Yeah, this fight was fun.
[13333.79s -> 13344.21s]  What about the king's pet?
[13344.21s -> 13347.21s]  Yeah, but if I was craving some Dark Souls, I'd play it.
[13347.21s -> 13349.77s]  It's not a bad game.
[13349.77s -> 13354.91s]  Yeah, this sucked.
[13354.91s -> 13359.60s]  I remember the cat jumping down and then I remember wanting to uninstall the game.
[13359.60s -> 13360.60s]  Why though?
[13360.60s -> 13369.18s]  It's because it's invisible.
[13369.18s -> 13376.05s]  Okay.
[13376.05s -> 13378.82s]  Blood, the king's pet.
[13378.82s -> 13380.82s]  Wait, you need to do it again?
[13380.82s -> 13384.11s]  It's not a bad game.
[13384.11s -> 13385.11s]  Yeah, this sucked.
[13385.11s -> 13386.11s]  I wanted to uninstall it.
[13386.11s -> 13387.11s]  Yeah, but I said...
[13387.11s -> 13388.74s]  Okay.
[13388.74s -> 13390.74s]  How many times did you hear me while I was playing Elden Rings?
[13390.74s -> 13391.74s]  They're saying I wanted to return the game.
[13391.74s -> 13395.19s]  What about the burnt ivory king?
[13395.19s -> 13397.71s]  What's going on?
[13397.71s -> 13400.94s]  Who's the king?
[13400.94s -> 13409.83s]  Where's the boss?
[13409.83s -> 13414.89s]  This is just open PVP.
[13414.89s -> 13424.55s]  Bro, somebody said, bro, this is so ugly.
[13424.55s -> 13433.10s]  Everybody's made out of clay and rocks.
[13433.10s -> 13434.10s]  That's what is wrong.
[13434.10s -> 13436.10s]  Where's the ivory king?
[13436.10s -> 13442.30s]  Bloodborne is uglier?
[13442.30s -> 13444.30s]  Oh my god, ban that person for life.
[13444.30s -> 13445.30s]  I mean it.
[13445.30s -> 13447.30s]  Ban that person for life.
[13447.30s -> 13450.11s]  Bro, that looked like battle chess.
[13450.11s -> 13463.26s]  Battle chess?
[13463.26s -> 13470.02s]  Oh my god, you just ruined Dark Souls 2 for me forever.
[13470.02s -> 13471.02s]  You just ruined Dark Souls 2.
[13471.02s -> 13473.70s]  I can't even play this again.
[13473.70s -> 13474.70s]  What the fuck?
[13474.70s -> 13484.06s]  Okay, you made me want to put this high though because that's really fun and funny.
[13484.06s -> 13486.06s]  It's a fun game.
[13486.06s -> 13487.06s]  Leave it alone.
[13487.06s -> 13502.72s]  Leave Dark Souls 2 alone, okay?
[13502.72s -> 13504.79s]  It's got...
[13504.79s -> 13505.79s]  Listen.
[13505.79s -> 13512.44s]  It's got some of the most content of any of the From Software games.
[13512.44s -> 13526.30s]  It might look like a mobile game ad, but I haven't looked back at Dark Souls 2 in a
[13526.30s -> 13527.30s]  long time.
[13527.30s -> 13536.23s]  You know, if I was a Dark Souls 2 defender right now, you're probably sitting in the
[13536.23s -> 13546.15s]  chat going like, fuck, I am a Dark Souls 2 defender.
[13546.15s -> 13550.40s]  Fume Knight is...
[13550.40s -> 13551.40s]  Fume Knight is...
[13551.40s -> 13552.40s]  Okay, let's do this.
[13552.40s -> 13554.70s]  And then I've got to make sure it's correct.
[13554.70s -> 13555.70s]  This is like 5 hours.
[13555.70s -> 13560.65s]  I'm a Dark Souls 2 defender and I'm malding.
[13560.65s -> 13564.95s]  Come on, that was Battle Chess.
[13564.95s -> 13574.99s]  And everyone's made out of pots and pans.
[13574.99s -> 13576.99s]  I like Dark Souls 2.
[13576.99s -> 13578.36s]  I do.
[13578.36s -> 13579.36s]  I really do.
[13579.36s -> 13580.36s]  It might be...
[13580.36s -> 13585.43s]  Fuck, it's literally at the bottom of my list, but they're all good.
[13585.43s -> 13586.43s]  Alright, let's do it.
[13586.43s -> 13587.93s]  Fume Knight.
[13587.93s -> 13595.84s]  Let's put the ones we know that are high, high.
[13595.84s -> 13597.84s]  Is Fume Knight cooler than the Taurus Demon?
[13597.84s -> 13601.51s]  Where is our...
[13601.51s -> 13602.51s]  Where's the Barometer?
[13602.51s -> 13603.51s]  It's Godfrey, right?
[13603.51s -> 13605.51s]  Is Fume Knight better than Godfrey?
[13605.51s -> 13614.41s]  You know, I think so.
[13614.41s -> 13618.38s]  I actually think so.
[13618.38s -> 13619.62s]  I do.
[13619.62s -> 13638.61s]  I even think Fume Knight is better than the Bloodstarve Beast, but that's where it ends.
[13638.61s -> 13639.61s]  We gotta give it to him, guys.
[13639.61s -> 13644.61s]  We gotta give him at least one encounter that's over the C-minus threshold.
[13644.61s -> 13650.39s]  I'm not done.
[13650.39s -> 13654.19s]  What...
[13654.19s -> 13655.19s]  Any of these...
[13655.19s -> 13656.19s]  Where's the...
[13656.19s -> 13657.19s]  Where's that fight right here?
[13657.19s -> 13659.19s]  War into Ivory King is fucking high.
[13659.19s -> 13660.56s]  Okay?
[13660.56s -> 13662.56s]  It's really high, because that was hilarious.
[13662.56s -> 13667.93s]  And comedy sometimes trumps gameplay a lot of the time.
[13667.93s -> 13671.17s]  Comedy can make gameplay look stupid.
[13671.17s -> 13676.17s]  I'm telling you right now, that Battle Chess comment makes this funner than the Elden Beast.
[13676.17s -> 13691.90s]  I would have more fun walking around hitting those guys and watching them play Battle Chess
[13691.90s -> 13698.58s]  than doing the Radagon-Elden Beast combo again.
[13698.58s -> 13704.27s]  I think that's okay being there.
[13704.27s -> 13709.18s]  Watch the intro to the Burned Ivory King.
[13709.18s -> 13734.35s]  Why?
[13734.35s -> 13740.46s]  Okay.
[13740.46s -> 13741.46s]  This stays there.
[13741.46s -> 13757.70s]  I love this.
[13757.70s -> 13758.70s]  This is...
[13758.70s -> 13759.70s]  I love this.
[13759.70s -> 13765.20s]  It reminds me of the boys.
[13765.20s -> 13767.40s]  It does.
[13767.40s -> 13768.40s]  Some of them are standing still.
[13768.40s -> 13769.40s]  Do you see?
[13769.40s -> 13772.83s]  That guy just drank a potion and he didn't get hit.
[13772.83s -> 13773.83s]  Yup.
[13773.83s -> 13777.18s]  I'm...
[13777.18s -> 13778.18s]  Comedy trumps all sometimes.
[13778.18s -> 13783.30s]  Sometimes comedy trumps all.
[13783.30s -> 13784.30s]  And that's where it belongs.
[13784.30s -> 13789.26s]  It's not...
[13789.26s -> 13790.26s]  I'm not giving it an S.
[13790.26s -> 13791.26s]  In fact, it's going here.
[13791.26s -> 13795.50s]  It's staying...
[13795.50s -> 13796.50s]  Okay.
[13796.50s -> 13797.50s]  Alright.
[13797.50s -> 13808.34s]  It's staying right here.
[13808.34s -> 13809.34s]  I don't...
[13809.34s -> 13810.34s]  Okay.
[13810.34s -> 13811.34s]  The Chariot is D.
[13811.34s -> 13812.90s]  That sucked.
[13812.90s -> 13813.90s]  Skeleton Lords was D.
[13813.90s -> 13817.85s]  The Slimer Demon is D.
[13817.85s -> 13821.39s]  C.
[13821.39s -> 13823.39s]  The Medusa Fight was actually pretty cool.
[13823.39s -> 13824.57s]  High C.
[13824.57s -> 13830.46s]  I don't think that's cooler than Godfrey though.
[13830.46s -> 13831.46s]  Old Iron King.
[13831.46s -> 13832.46s]  I forgot what it was already.
[13832.46s -> 13833.76s]  Smelter Demon.
[13833.76s -> 13836.38s]  I forgot what it was.
[13836.38s -> 13837.38s]  Rotten.
[13837.38s -> 13839.26s]  This one was...
[13839.26s -> 13840.26s]  This one was kind of fun.
[13840.26s -> 13844.32s]  This is like another Slimer.
[13844.32s -> 13845.32s]  Demon of Song.
[13845.32s -> 13851.94s]  Oh.
[13851.94s -> 13852.94s]  The music turned off.
[13852.94s -> 13854.94s]  That was weird.
[13854.94s -> 13857.14s]  Oh.
[13857.14s -> 13858.14s]  The music turned off.
[13858.14s -> 13859.14s]  Video paused.
[13859.14s -> 13860.14s]  Are you still watching?
[13860.14s -> 13864.20s]  Continue watching.
[13864.20s -> 13865.44s]  Thanks for confirming.
[13865.44s -> 13866.44s]  Did I just get Netflixed?
[13866.44s -> 13869.92s]  I gotta go.
[13869.92s -> 13875.66s]  I've been sitting here for like so long.
[13875.66s -> 13876.66s]  Okay.
[13876.66s -> 13877.66s]  I want the Demon of Song.
[13877.66s -> 13884.93s]  It's definitely not cooler than any of the Sekiro fights.
[13884.93s -> 13886.93s]  Is there a Sekiro fight that's...
[13886.93s -> 13889.83s]  Yeah.
[13889.83s -> 13890.83s]  Okay.
[13890.83s -> 13894.74s]  You can stay down here.
[13894.74s -> 13898.70s]  The Scorpion was pretty cool.
[13898.70s -> 13899.70s]  C.
[13899.70s -> 13901.58s]  Royal Rat Authority.
[13901.58s -> 13902.58s]  I mean, everyone was laughing at that.
[13902.58s -> 13905.58s]  It was like a Scooby Doo dog with a tongue hanging out.
[13905.58s -> 13906.58s]  I didn't even fight this.
[13906.58s -> 13911.30s]  I was gonna put it down here.
[13911.30s -> 13913.30s]  Rattling Magus and Congregation.
[13913.30s -> 13915.30s]  I don't remember fighting this.
[13915.30s -> 13916.86s]  The Last Giant.
[13916.86s -> 13917.86s]  That's the first boss in the game.
[13917.86s -> 13919.86s]  I'm gonna give it a good low C.
[13919.86s -> 13923.26s]  Duke's Deer Freya.
[13923.26s -> 13924.26s]  That one was not that bad.
[13924.26s -> 13927.65s]  Probably like a high low C.
[13927.65s -> 13929.95s]  Twin Dragon Riders is a low C.
[13929.95s -> 13931.13s]  Looking Glass Knight.
[13931.13s -> 13932.13s]  That's a high C.
[13932.13s -> 13935.20s]  Not better than Fume Knight.
[13935.20s -> 13936.20s]  Not better than Godfrey.
[13936.20s -> 13940.90s]  The Royal Aegis.
[13940.90s -> 13941.90s]  This one was pretty cool.
[13941.90s -> 13944.99s]  Low B.
[13944.99s -> 13945.99s]  No.
[13945.99s -> 13947.55s]  High C before Godfrey.
[13947.55s -> 13949.56s]  Fendrik.
[13949.56s -> 13950.56s]  This was a D.
[13950.56s -> 13951.56s]  No.
[13951.56s -> 13952.56s]  This is a low C.
[13952.56s -> 13955.08s]  Ancient Dragon F.
[13955.08s -> 13958.34s]  Guardian Dragon is like a C.
[13958.34s -> 13962.67s]  Giant Lord is like a C.
[13962.67s -> 13964.94s]  Dark Lurker.
[13964.94s -> 13967.94s]  I don't think I fought this.
[13967.94s -> 13969.50s]  Pursuer.
[13969.50s -> 13970.50s]  Pursuer was pretty fun.
[13970.50s -> 13971.50s]  It was pretty challenging.
[13971.50s -> 13972.50s]  I'll give it a C.
[13972.50s -> 13976.34s]  Throne Watcher and Throne Defender.
[13976.34s -> 13977.34s]  I'll give it a C.
[13977.34s -> 13978.34s]  Machandra.
[13978.34s -> 13984.74s]  I'll give it a C.
[13986.24s -> 13987.24s]  Fowler of the First Sin.
[13987.24s -> 13989.24s]  That's the funny guy that's in the ground.
[13989.24s -> 13991.38s]  I'll give it a C.
[13991.38s -> 13992.38s]  Grave Robbers.
[13992.38s -> 13993.38s]  Everyone said give that an F.
[13993.38s -> 13999.38s]  I don't even remember fighting it.
[13999.38s -> 14002.38s]  Dragon Rider has comedy points because you can make them fall off the edge.
[14002.38s -> 14003.38s]  And that's pretty cool.
[14003.38s -> 14004.62s]  I like that.
[14004.62s -> 14008.03s]  B.
[14008.03s -> 14010.03s]  The Queen was pretty cool.
[14010.03s -> 14012.74s]  I'll give it a C.
[14012.74s -> 14014.74s]  Flumbering Dragon was pretty cool.
[14014.74s -> 14015.74s]  I'll give it a high C.
[14015.74s -> 14018.52s]  Smelter Demon.
[14018.52s -> 14019.52s]  I'll give it a C.
[14019.52s -> 14022.23s]  Sir Alone.
[14022.23s -> 14024.23s]  This one was pretty cool.
[14024.23s -> 14025.23s]  I'll give it a C.
[14025.23s -> 14027.56s]  King's Pet F.
[14027.56s -> 14029.06s]  King's Pet F.
[14029.06s -> 14034.22s]  I actually like this boss that's going high.
[14034.22s -> 14038.50s]  The design of this boss alone is cool.
[14038.50s -> 14040.87s]  It is cooler than Godfrey.
[14040.87s -> 14043.97s]  Where's Godfrey?
[14043.97s -> 14046.98s]  It's cooler than Godfrey, for sure.
[14046.98s -> 14049.54s]  Where the fuck is Godfrey?
[14049.54s -> 14053.72s]  Where's Godfrey?
[14053.72s -> 14056.92s]  Oh wow, you're way higher than Godfrey.
[14056.92s -> 14064.98s]  You're cooler than the Godskin Noble.
[14064.98s -> 14065.98s]  They overdid this.
[14065.98s -> 14066.98s]  I'm putting it down.
[14066.98s -> 14071.62s]  Dragon Slayer.
[14071.62s -> 14072.62s]  I'm going to give it a C.
[14072.62s -> 14076.48s]  Gargoyles D.
[14076.48s -> 14079.81s]  Ruin Sentinels F.
[14079.81s -> 14082.75s]  Lost Sinner.
[14082.75s -> 14084.18s]  I'm going to give it a C.
[14084.18s -> 14085.18s]  Royal Rat Vanguard.
[14085.18s -> 14087.58s]  Royal Rat Vanguard.
[14087.58s -> 14088.58s]  I'm going to give it a D.
[14088.58s -> 14090.58s]  Well no, I'll give it a C.
[14090.58s -> 14093.54s]  Okay.
[14093.54s -> 14115.10s]  I've got to get this right.
[14115.10s -> 14116.10s]  Top row is done.
[14116.10s -> 14149.53s]  Now it is.
[14149.53s -> 14151.53s]  I need silence for this because this is really important.
[14151.53s -> 14156.05s]  This is the thing people are going to point to to say that I'm like a piece of shit for
[14156.05s -> 14157.05s]  the rest of my life.
[14157.05s -> 14158.05s]  I have to make sure this is correct.
[14158.05s -> 14171.02s]  This is one of the most important things I've ever done on stream because some of you after
[14171.02s -> 14174.02s]  this are going to hate me for the rest of your life.
[14174.02s -> 14176.26s]  I've got to see what happens here.
[14176.26s -> 14180.86s]  Is Gas Coin better than...
[14180.86s -> 14182.55s]  No.
[14182.55s -> 14183.55s]  This was a cooler fight.
[14183.55s -> 14190.40s]  Sullivan cooler than Gas Coin.
[14190.40s -> 14192.09s]  Yeah.
[14192.09s -> 14195.67s]  Ibritos cooler than Gas Coin.
[14195.67s -> 14198.70s]  No.
[14198.70s -> 14201.07s]  Any of these cooler than Ibritos.
[14201.07s -> 14204.74s]  Yes.
[14204.74s -> 14218.85s]  Yes.
[14218.85s -> 14220.85s]  Bloodborne is losing a lot of ground here.
[14220.85s -> 14221.85s]  It's Dark Souls 3.
[14221.85s -> 14222.85s]  No.
[14222.85s -> 14223.85s]  No.
[14223.85s -> 14224.85s]  Sekiro sucks.
[14224.85s -> 14269.71s]  I refuse to give it a S.
[14269.71s -> 14271.66s]  I'm kidding.
[14271.66s -> 14285.38s]  It's fine.
[14285.38s -> 14286.38s]  Dark Souls 2.
[14286.38s -> 14300.16s]  I don't think I can move any of these.
[14300.16s -> 14303.16s]  B is just as important as A though because some of these might have to level up.
[14303.16s -> 14314.77s]  No.
[14314.77s -> 14315.77s]  No.
[14315.77s -> 14317.52s]  No.
[14317.52s -> 14321.70s]  No.
[14321.70s -> 14325.10s]  No.
[14325.10s -> 14327.05s]  Yes.
[14327.05s -> 14351.71s]  Yes.
[14351.71s -> 14353.91s]  Yes.
[14353.91s -> 14354.91s]  And fuck Raikar too.
[14354.91s -> 14358.07s]  Dancer is cooler than Mog.
[14358.07s -> 14359.07s]  You know what?
[14359.07s -> 14365.18s]  So is Isshin and so is...
[14365.18s -> 14370.98s]  Shaping Dragon is not cooler than any of these.
[14370.98s -> 14396.98s]  What is this doing up here?
[14396.98s -> 14397.98s]  The music in this is so good.
[14397.98s -> 14406.95s]  I think Wet Nurse goes down below Tree Sentinel.
[14406.95s -> 14410.95s]  That was just such an insane awesome moment when you open up the door and Limgrave is there
[14410.95s -> 14411.95s]  and there's the Tree Sentinel.
[14411.95s -> 14413.95s]  It's like wow the graphics.
[14413.95s -> 14414.95s]  I can...
[14414.95s -> 14463.42s]  Wow.
[14463.42s -> 14464.42s]  Shit.
[14464.42s -> 14471.55s]  Sekiro is way better than I thought it was.
[14473.11s -> 14479.32s]  Thank you for the correction you're right.
[14479.32s -> 14481.90s]  Is this good?
[14481.90s -> 14488.97s]  Is B good?
[14488.97s -> 14489.97s]  This fight didn't last long enough.
[14489.97s -> 14490.97s]  It would have been A.
[14490.97s -> 14494.04s]  It just was a massive DPS raise.
[14494.04s -> 14515.84s]  These are like the same kind of fight and this one was cooler by far.
[14515.84s -> 14519.81s]  This is cooler than this.
[14519.81s -> 14522.65s]  Cooler than that too.
[14522.65s -> 14524.91s]  No it's not.
[14524.91s -> 14532.62s]  Vort's way too high.
[14532.62s -> 14538.67s]  Vort and Wulner make sense at the same spot.
[14538.67s -> 14544.43s]  Gundyr is in the wrong spot as well.
[14544.43s -> 14545.74s]  But cooler than this.
[14545.74s -> 14548.00s]  These are way too high.
[14548.00s -> 14549.94s]  Way too high.
[14549.94s -> 14567.89s]  I think this is too low.
[14567.89s -> 14585.18s]  I think that's in a perfect spot.
[14585.18s -> 14588.02s]  Okay.
[14588.02s -> 14589.02s]  Um.
[14589.02s -> 14590.02s]  Dark Souls 2.
[14590.02s -> 14592.28s]  Oh okay.
[14592.28s -> 14593.28s]  Everything in Dark Souls.
[14593.28s -> 14598.28s]  Is every single boss in Dark Souls 2 that's not the ones I put high better than the Taurus
[14598.28s -> 14607.26s]  Demon?
[14607.26s -> 14608.26s]  I mean I don't know about that.
[14608.26s -> 14615.71s]  Put these down.
[14615.71s -> 14617.91s]  Put this up.
[14617.91s -> 14620.28s]  All the Dark Souls 3 stuff goes up now.
[14620.28s -> 14622.54s]  Except for this.
[14622.54s -> 14624.62s]  Cleric Beast goes down.
[14624.62s -> 14625.62s]  Fuck this fight.
[14625.62s -> 14626.62s]  Stupid.
[14626.62s -> 14630.10s]  It's the worst fight in the whole game.
[14630.10s -> 14631.10s]  But it's better than everything in Dark Souls 2.
[14631.10s -> 14633.62s]  Hold on.
[14633.62s -> 14638.40s]  I gotta make sure I do this right.
[14638.40s -> 14640.40s]  Dark Souls 2 is like the C.
[14640.40s -> 14645.95s]  No that can stay there.
[14645.95s -> 14646.95s]  So can that.
[14646.95s -> 14647.95s]  And so can this.
[14647.95s -> 14658.98s]  The gold skin duo is bad.
[14658.98s -> 14659.98s]  These are cooler than the Taurus Demon.
[14659.98s -> 14660.98s]  They are.
[14660.98s -> 14662.98s]  Old King is cooler than the Taurus Demon as well.
[14662.98s -> 14663.98s]  Way cooler.
[14663.98s -> 14670.28s]  I'm swapping these.
[14670.28s -> 14671.28s]  Moon Presence has to come way down.
[14671.28s -> 14687.50s]  Fuck.
[14687.50s -> 14688.50s]  This is too high.
[14688.50s -> 14696.24s]  I think that's in a good spot.
[14696.24s -> 14700.45s]  Seath the Scaleless sucks.
[14700.45s -> 14703.22s]  Um.
[14703.22s -> 14704.22s]  But it's cooler than Godfrey.
[14704.22s -> 14706.22s]  And it's cooler than the old hero.
[14706.22s -> 14709.36s]  Is it cooler than the Fume Knight?
[14709.36s -> 14710.66s]  I'll say yes.
[14717.79s -> 14724.44s]  But the really important one is what is the worst fucking thing I've done ever in a From Software game?
[14724.44s -> 14731.10s]  I think that's good.
[14731.10s -> 14737.43s]  These are all the same to me.
[14737.43s -> 14738.43s]  That's where it belongs.
[14738.43s -> 14739.43s]  To me.
[14739.43s -> 14740.43s]  And I have to be honest.
[14740.43s -> 14745.26s]  Okay.
[14745.26s -> 14749.54s]  What's the worst thing I've ever done.
[14749.54s -> 14750.54s]  Ever.
[14750.54s -> 14752.54s]  In a From Software game.
[14752.54s -> 14756.86s]  This is pretty low.
[14756.86s -> 14759.54s]  It's always bed of chaos.
[14759.54s -> 14763.83s]  I hated this so much though.
[14763.83s -> 14764.83s]  I did.
[14764.83s -> 14765.83s]  I hated it.
[14765.83s -> 14766.83s]  This is probably worse.
[14766.83s -> 14768.20s]  And so is this.
[14768.20s -> 14769.20s]  These are probably worse than that as well.
[14769.20s -> 14771.50s]  Dragon God is worse than that.
[14771.50s -> 14773.32s]  The Grave Robber shit.
[14773.32s -> 14774.32s]  I mean it's bad.
[14774.32s -> 14776.32s]  These are all bad.
[14776.32s -> 14777.32s]  Ruin Sentinels are bad.
[14777.32s -> 14778.32s]  Probably the worst.
[14778.32s -> 14779.32s]  No.
[14779.32s -> 14780.32s]  Maybe.
[14780.32s -> 14781.32s]  They might be.
[14781.32s -> 14782.32s]  It's possible.
[14782.32s -> 14783.32s]  Deacons could be the worst.
[14783.32s -> 14835.30s]  Is it done?
[14835.30s -> 14838.30s]  Millennia is better than the fucking goddamn Skeleton Lords.
[14838.30s -> 14839.30s]  Right?
[14839.30s -> 14841.75s]  Like I gotta be fair.
[14841.75s -> 14842.75s]  I'm trying to think.
[14842.75s -> 14847.13s]  Is better than.
[14847.13s -> 14848.13s]  Millennia is better than Pinwheel.
[14848.13s -> 14849.13s]  Pinwheel will come back.
[14849.13s -> 14850.43s]  Pinwheel will go to F.
[14850.43s -> 14864.34s]  I refuse to put it higher than D.
[14864.34s -> 14866.34s]  I just hated that fight so much.
[14866.34s -> 14870.35s]  Lady Butterfly is only there because it prevents me from playing the game anymore.
[14870.35s -> 14874.58s]  It's an encounter you have to do.
[14874.58s -> 14878.06s]  Done.
[14878.06s -> 14879.06s]  Stamp it.
[14879.06s -> 14880.30s]  Sign it.
[14880.30s -> 14882.50s]  Done.
[14882.50s -> 14883.50s]  It's over.
[14883.50s -> 14885.50s]  All these are mini bosses or stuff that I can't really place.
[14885.50s -> 14891.20s]  It's over.
[14891.20s -> 14892.20s]  What about Morgoth?
[14892.20s -> 14903.08s]  Yeah, I made the joke about how I can't place Morgoth, but I'll place him.
[14903.08s -> 14908.93s]  It's cool.
[14908.93s -> 14910.10s]  There you are.
[14910.10s -> 14913.01s]  It's over.
[14913.01s -> 14916.01s]  There is my official From Software boss tier list.
[14916.01s -> 14918.01s]  It only took us about 5 hours.
[14918.01s -> 14920.14s]  Butterfly is optional.
[14920.14s -> 14921.14s]  You're a dumbass.
[14921.14s -> 14936.03s]  So what game do I like the most?
[14936.03s -> 14937.66s]  Okay.
[14937.66s -> 14943.54s]  We're going to count how many bosses are in S, A, or B.
[14943.54s -> 14944.54s]  Let's start with Bloodborne.
[14944.54s -> 14945.84s]  It's right here.
[14945.84s -> 14954.28s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[14954.28s -> 14958.22s]  There are nine bosses here from Bloodborne.
[14958.22s -> 14968.13s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
[14968.13s -> 14970.13s]  those are Demon's Souls.
[14970.13s -> 14977.18s]  Twelve, thirteen, fourteen from Elden Ring.
[14977.18s -> 14979.62s]  Dark Souls 3.
[14979.62s -> 14991.28s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
[14991.28s -> 14997.23s]  Twelve versus fourteen.
[14997.23s -> 15001.16s]  And there are way more bosses.
[15001.16s -> 15007.11s]  Way more bosses in Elden Ring.
[15007.11s -> 15010.42s]  Dark Souls 3 might be my favorite one.
[15010.42s -> 15020.42s]  Boss encounters wise, if we're just talking straight up boss fights, I think Dark Souls
[15020.42s -> 15022.85s]  3 has the best boss fights.
[15022.85s -> 15028.09s]  Below that, I think Bloodborne and Elden Ring both kind of are tied for me in boss encounters.
[15028.09s -> 15034.68s]  Although I think Bloodborne edges it a little bit more.
[15034.68s -> 15040.12s]  Dark Souls 3 is baby easy.
[15040.12s -> 15051.06s]  And Sekiro though, five, six, seven, there are nine.
[15051.06s -> 15055.36s]  I liked Sekiro, apparently, the boss fights as much as I liked Bloodborne.
[15055.36s -> 15057.92s]  Kind of, right?
[15057.92s -> 15069.89s]  I guess I'm surprising myself that I actually did sort of like that game.
[15069.89s -> 15070.89s]  What about the F's?
[15070.89s -> 15071.89s]  This is important too.
[15071.89s -> 15077.97s]  Holy shit, I don't give a fuck about Dark Souls 1 at all.
[15077.97s -> 15087.87s]  One, two, what about the D's and F's?
[15087.87s -> 15091.87s]  Lots of Dark Souls 1 and D. A lot.
[15091.87s -> 15094.65s]  Damn.
[15094.65s -> 15103.10s]  Huh.
[15103.10s -> 15110.11s]  If you take the aggregate, I think Dark Souls 2 has a better score than Dark Souls 1 on
[15110.11s -> 15113.66s]  this tier list.
[15113.66s -> 15118.30s]  I mean, there's way more Dark Souls 2 bosses, that's not fair.
[15118.30s -> 15120.30s]  Lot of Elden Ring and D as well though.
[15120.30s -> 15128.74s]  There was like a fucking hundred of them.
[15128.74s -> 15133.92s]  Alright, that's cool.
[15133.92s -> 15136.16s]  I still think my opinion stands.
[15136.16s -> 15139.87s]  That's Demon's Souls, oh right, not Elden Ring.
[15139.87s -> 15141.87s]  Dark Souls 1 unironically sucks.
[15141.87s -> 15143.87s]  It was just better than Demon's Souls.
[15143.87s -> 15147.87s]  I actually liked Demon's Souls better than Dark Souls 1 because you could fast travel.
[15147.87s -> 15152.87s]  Wait until like two thirds plus more than halfway through the game to travel in Dark
[15152.87s -> 15161.47s]  Souls 1.
[15161.47s -> 15171.52s]  I think that Dark Souls 1 is way higher than am I lying to you?
[15171.52s -> 15182.00s]  If you told me right now, would you rather start playing Dark Souls 1 right now or Sekiro?
[15182.00s -> 15195.95s]  I would probably say Sekiro.
[15195.95s -> 15199.79s]  Yeah, I think so.
[15199.79s -> 15204.79s]  Part of that I think has to do with the fact that I have played through Dark Souls 1 like
[15204.79s -> 15205.79s]  five to ten times.
[15205.79s -> 15211.14s]  I've only played through Sekiro once, so that's probably one of the reasons why.
[15211.14s -> 15223.38s]  Dark Souls 1 is just a solid video game that kind of, it was right after Demon's Souls
[15223.38s -> 15226.38s]  was cool and everybody was like wow that's a cool concept.
[15226.38s -> 15229.38s]  They made Dark Souls 1 this interconnected world.
[15229.38s -> 15231.56s]  It was a cool experience.
[15231.56s -> 15233.56s]  It was unlike anything else anyone ever played.
[15233.56s -> 15236.44s]  It's just old.
[15236.44s -> 15238.45s]  Older.
[15238.45s -> 15243.82s]  And it's hard to put it above stuff that came ten years later from the same company
[15243.82s -> 15245.82s]  that is effectively the same video games.
[15245.82s -> 15252.10s]  And even still, like somebody just said, it is unlike anything else still because they
[15252.10s -> 15256.10s]  got rid of the interconnected world where you run from place to place and you don't
[15256.10s -> 15257.10s]  fast travel.
[15257.10s -> 15258.10s]  They got rid of that.
[15258.10s -> 15261.65s]  Sekiro's level design was really good.
[15261.65s -> 15262.65s]  It was.
[15262.65s -> 15268.19s]  Maybe I unnecessarily hate Sekiro for no reason.
[15268.19s -> 15270.19s]  Maybe it was just hard.
[15270.19s -> 15275.25s]  I remember crying.
[15275.25s -> 15291.67s]  If Millenia didn't have the one bullshit move, where would she be?
[15291.67s -> 15302.62s]  We have to live in reality.
[15302.62s -> 15307.75s]  Waterfall is fine laughing my ass up.
[15307.75s -> 15319.37s]  When you make your tier list, you can put Millenia, Blade of Mykola, up here.
[15319.37s -> 15327.55s]  But there's no chance in hell that Millenia is cooler than Gehrman that's not happening.
[15327.55s -> 15329.92s]  Nameless King, not happening.
[15329.92s -> 15331.92s]  Inichiro, not happening.
[15331.92s -> 15334.74s]  Seed, not happening.
[15334.74s -> 15340.22s]  Pontiff Sullivan, not happening.
[15340.22s -> 15343.78s]  Better than Legarius, not happening.
[15343.78s -> 15346.86s]  Better than Abyss Watchers, I'll give you that.
[15346.86s -> 15349.86s]  Better than Ornstein and Smog, not happening.
[15349.86s -> 15359.35s]  This is really unfair.
[15359.35s -> 15365.06s]  I'm just mad at this because I just did it and I hated it.
[15365.06s -> 15369.06s]  Give me like two months, ask me again, and she'll probably be up here.
[15369.06s -> 15373.86s]  Ornstein and Smog, overrated.
[15373.86s -> 15376.10s]  A lot of people think I have this underrated.
[15376.10s -> 15380.39s]  I thought I put it in a good place.
[15380.39s -> 15382.39s]  This is a good tier list, not happening.
[15382.39s -> 15394.08s]  We're not doing this again.
[15394.08s -> 15397.15s]  That was fun though.
[15397.15s -> 15399.15s]  That was just chilling, just doing this.
[15399.15s -> 15401.71s]  What a weird stream.
[15401.71s -> 15408.98s]  I played in a Fortnite tournament and I did a five hour From Software tier list.
[15408.98s -> 15416.19s]  What a fucking weird stream this was.
[15416.19s -> 15417.19s]  I had a good time.
[15417.19s -> 15423.34s]  I don't like the fact that the internet kept having problems for no reason.
[15423.34s -> 15425.34s]  Somebody was going like this to the wire.
[15425.34s -> 15426.34s]  I don't get it.
[15426.34s -> 15430.65s]  It's annoying.
[15431.65s -> 15433.65s]  Dude, what the fuck is the Fortnite?
[15433.65s -> 15437.65s]  The one guy that came in for the Fortnite question?
[15437.65s -> 15440.17s]  I feel so bad.
[15440.17s -> 15444.17s]  That person is going to go to the VOD and just like scroll through and be like,
[15444.17s -> 15446.17s]  this is fucking stupid.
[15446.17s -> 15451.97s]  This guy had to resort to doing magic tricks because he doesn't know how to play Fortnite
[15451.97s -> 15453.97s]  and he joined a tournament.
[15453.97s -> 15459.54s]  I put money into Fortnite.
[15459.54s -> 15461.54s]  I bought a skin.
[15461.54s -> 15465.70s]  You missed the magic tricks?
[15465.70s -> 15466.70s]  You did?
[15466.70s -> 15469.86s]  That was the big nose of yours?
[15469.86s -> 15470.86s]  Sure.
[15470.86s -> 15478.75s]  I have a crooked nose.
[15478.75s -> 15479.75s]  Do you know that?
[15479.75s -> 15483.87s]  My nose is crooked.
[15483.87s -> 15484.87s]  You know, it goes that way.
[15484.87s -> 15486.87s]  Like it goes like this.
[15486.87s -> 15490.46s]  It's way more pronounced going this way, right?
[15490.46s -> 15491.46s]  Like that.
[15491.46s -> 15492.46s]  My nose is like this.
[15492.46s -> 15498.24s]  A link to the tier list.
[15498.24s -> 15500.24s]  Yep, I will.
[15500.24s -> 15501.61s]  I think it's a pretty good list.
[15501.61s -> 15503.61s]  I think it's, I mean, obviously Dark Souls 2.
[15503.61s -> 15506.61s]  I don't want to hate Dark Souls 2 and I think it's not fair.
[15506.61s -> 15512.04s]  I think it's a good big junk.
[15512.04s -> 15514.04s]  A bunch of, it's good.
[15514.04s -> 15515.04s]  I liked it.
[15515.04s -> 15516.04s]  I do like it.
[15516.04s -> 15524.98s]  I had enjoyed my time and I played through it a couple of times.
[15524.98s -> 15527.98s]  Osiris is the most forgettable thing in the game.
[15527.98s -> 15533.14s]  It shouldn't be at A.
[15533.14s -> 15536.38s]  Well, it should be at A, but it should not be higher than that.
[15536.38s -> 15537.38s]  That's what you meant to say.
[15537.38s -> 15539.38s]  Because, I mean, it's not cooler than that.
[15539.38s -> 15543.55s]  It's not.
[15543.55s -> 15544.55s]  Okay, now we're done.
[15544.55s -> 15556.12s]  Are you doing more magic tricks?
[15556.12s -> 15557.12s]  Or Dark Souls 2.
[15557.12s -> 15558.12s]  I feel bad.
[15558.12s -> 15560.51s]  It's okay.
[15560.51s -> 15563.51s]  All right, let me link to the, let me link to it.
[15563.51s -> 15566.84s]  All right, I'll see you guys later.
[15566.84s -> 15569.83s]  That's the end of the stream.
[15569.83s -> 15571.83s]  Kind of a weird one today, but you know.
[15571.83s -> 15583.98s]  The next stream, by the way, is going to be today's Tuesday.
[15583.98s -> 15587.78s]  I will see you guys on Friday?
[15587.78s -> 15588.78s]  Is that maybe Friday or Saturday?
[15588.78s -> 15597.22s]  Let's say, let's say Saturday.
[15597.22s -> 15598.85s]  We'll do Saturday, Sunday.
[15598.85s -> 15603.28s]  Is this the time where we pick to do Elden Ring invasions and PvP and stuff?
[15603.28s -> 15617.32s]  That might be a fun time to do it on Saturday, like afternoon.
[15617.32s -> 15621.88s]  And that will wrap up a lot of the Elden Ring stuff.
[15621.88s -> 15624.88s]  And then Sunday, you know, why don't we go play DOS games?
[15624.88s -> 15629.09s]  I think DOS Sunday sounds fun.
[15629.09s -> 15631.33s]  I'll get a bunch of crazy shit.
[15631.33s -> 15632.33s]  Do some DOS games.
[15632.33s -> 15641.93s]  So if you want to do Elden Ring multiplayer, Saturday is the day.
[15641.93s -> 15644.83s]  Put it on your calendar.
[15644.83s -> 15653.09s]  You're going to do a fight club?
[15653.09s -> 15660.76s]  I think I'm just going to put a password down and I'm just going to put my sign somewhere.
[15660.76s -> 15662.06s]  See what happens.
[15662.06s -> 15664.01s]  I moisturize.
[15664.01s -> 15666.01s]  I actually really do that, seriously.
[15666.01s -> 15669.95s]  Your 30 to 40 year old self will be very happy with you.
[15669.95s -> 15678.76s]  The battle chest, that might be my favorite one guy of the year so far.
[15678.76s -> 15680.64s]  That was an amazing comment.
[15680.64s -> 15684.18s]  You see the R play stuff?
[15684.18s -> 15685.18s]  I did.
[15685.18s -> 15686.18s]  I've been keeping up with it.
[15686.18s -> 15689.34s]  Although, isn't it over?
[15689.34s -> 15690.78s]  It ended, right?
[15690.78s -> 15697.20s]  Yeah, it's over.
[15697.20s -> 15710.02s]  Link the tier list.
[15710.02s -> 15711.02s]  I did.
[15711.02s -> 15712.02s]  I did, didn't I?
[15712.02s -> 15713.02s]  There you go.
[15713.02s -> 15721.60s]  What's the moisturizing routine?
[15721.60s -> 15722.60s]  Right out of the shower.
[15722.60s -> 15724.10s]  Dry your face.
[15724.10s -> 15726.10s]  Use a light moisturizing cream.
[15726.10s -> 15728.10s]  Make sure it's for your face.
[15728.10s -> 15729.59s]  Light.
[15729.59s -> 15734.74s]  None of this heavy, heavy cream shit.
[15734.74s -> 15736.74s]  They don't like the hand cream stuff.
[15736.74s -> 15738.04s]  No, no, no.
[15738.04s -> 15739.04s]  Get a light face moisturizer.
[15739.04s -> 15740.04s]  Water-based.
[15740.04s -> 15741.28s]  The ones that are gel.
[15742.28s -> 15745.72s]  They're kind of like a watery gel.
[15745.72s -> 15749.52s]  That's what you want.
[15749.52s -> 15751.52s]  When you get out of the shower, you dry your face.
[15751.52s -> 15755.02s]  Pat it dry for a little bit.
[15755.02s -> 15758.71s]  Get your light, kind of water, gel-based, base lotion.
[15758.71s -> 15760.40s]  It's the tip of your middle finger.
[15760.40s -> 15761.40s]  That's all you need.
[15761.40s -> 15762.64s]  Work it into your hands a little bit.
[15762.64s -> 15764.64s]  Maybe tap it on the cheekbones.
[15764.64s -> 15765.64s]  Rub it in.
[15765.64s -> 15766.64s]  All around your face.
[15766.64s -> 15768.01s]  Do that every day.
[15768.01s -> 15776.99s]  Skin routine.
[15776.99s -> 15780.34s]  It's really good for you.
[15780.34s -> 15781.34s]  It is.
[15781.34s -> 15783.67s]  It helps.
[15783.67s -> 15784.67s]  All right, guys.
[15784.67s -> 15785.67s]  It's late.
[15785.67s -> 15787.04s]  I'm going to get out of here.
[15787.04s -> 15788.04s]  Thanks for watching Fortnite?
[15788.04s -> 15789.04s]  Question mark.
[15789.04s -> 15792.04s]  And the from software tier list.
[15792.04s -> 15796.90s]  This is a weird one.
[15796.90s -> 15801.32s]  Sometimes they're weird.
[15801.32s -> 15803.32s]  Hanging out and doing the tier list was fun.
[15803.32s -> 15806.32s]  It's cool just to kind of look at stuff and hang out with you guys.
[15806.32s -> 15808.50s]  Doesn't have to be like crazy, right?
[15808.50s -> 15811.99s]  They don't all have to be crazy.
[15811.99s -> 15813.99s]  In fact, none of them are crazy.
[15813.99s -> 15814.99s]  I'm a normal person.
[15814.99s -> 15816.99s]  I'm a regular guy.
[15816.99s -> 15818.99s]  And I don't do crazy things.
[15818.99s -> 15821.36s]  We relax and do tier lists.
[15821.36s -> 15822.36s]  That's what we do.
[15822.36s -> 15831.96s]  If you're still here from Atrioc, thanks for the raid.
[15831.96s -> 15835.03s]  Hope you enjoyed yourselves.
[15835.03s -> 15840.18s]  And I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[15840.18s -> 15843.12s]  Have a great night.
[15843.12s -> 15844.12s]  Take care of yourselves.
[15844.12s -> 15845.55s]  Bye.
