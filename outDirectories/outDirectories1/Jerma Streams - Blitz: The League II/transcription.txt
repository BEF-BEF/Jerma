[1.34s -> 10.41s]  Hello, hello, hello. Hi. Yes, we're here. Well, that was what we'd like to call an adventure.
[10.41s -> 24.78s]  So for those of you that don't know, I had a plan today. I was thinking of starting the ace attorney.
[24.78s -> 28.30s]  See, no, I'm not gonna wait. I'm gonna wait. I'm gonna wait because there are people probably
[28.30s -> 35.66s]  coming in. Remember, we're watching the Super Bowl. So am I. There's a long list of what's
[35.66s -> 45.74s]  going on today. First of all, free nothing. Patriots just scored. I don't have a TV.
[46.38s -> 51.38s]  I don't have cable that can watch this game and I'm not watching it right now a lot.
[52.10s -> 67.46s]  I'm getting the like website updates on what happened. That's bad. I forgot today was the
[67.46s -> 76.30s]  Super Bowl. Okay. I had, I did not know this last night, late last night when we were like,
[76.30s -> 81.43s]  oh yeah, tomorrow we're gonna do ace attorney. That sounds like a good idea. Let's do ace
[81.43s -> 88.57s]  attorney tomorrow during the Super Bowl. I was like, ah, I woke up this morning and two things
[88.57s -> 92.73s]  happened. First thing that happened is the Super Bowl is today. Do you know how I knew that?
[93.69s -> 100.10s]  Because my entire family sent me messages telling me how excited they are. And I was
[100.10s -> 103.94s]  like, what are they excited for? It was like, I have like 40 messages from my family
[104.98s -> 109.62s]  and they all, they're all dressed in Patriots. This is all the Super Bowl is today.
[110.87s -> 117.19s]  I forgot. And so the plan was gonna play ace attorney, but you know, that's just the way it
[117.19s -> 123.64s]  is. Ace attorney, Phoenix Wright. And that didn't turn out the way that I wanted to for two
[123.64s -> 128.12s]  reasons. One, yes, Super Bowl. And I wanted to pay attention to it because the Patriots
[128.12s -> 134.09s]  are in it. That's my team. You know, until the Raiders get here, that's my team. Problem
[134.09s -> 143.37s]  two, uh, ace attorney. I have, I bought them all on the iPad. So iPad comes in sick. There's my iPad
[143.37s -> 148.81s]  got a crack in it, but it still works. My splitter. Okay. Yeah. I packed that one. Remember
[148.81s -> 155.86s]  I packed that one. I don't have the audio splitter, so I couldn't capture the audio
[155.86s -> 163.46s]  from my iPad. Somehow it got lost in the move, got lost in the mail. Thought about potentially
[163.46s -> 169.75s]  emulating like, all right, I bought them all. I have them all on iPad. Let's whatever. Like
[169.75s -> 174.39s]  this idea came out last night, right? Like ace attorney. I didn't really plan that much on it.
[174.39s -> 177.11s]  It was like last night I bought them and like, I'm going to try it this morning and
[178.25s -> 187.94s]  you see how it went. Um, the emulators, they're, they're all removed from the internet,
[187.94s -> 191.38s]  at least on a couple of the places that I thought. Cause you know, I all, I own the
[191.46s -> 200.36s]  titles maybe out of desperation. I've bought them, I own them. And then I heard that there's
[200.36s -> 207.70s]  going to be a PC remaster of ace attorney coming out very soon. So I'm sitting here going,
[207.70s -> 218.62s]  Oh God damn it. What the fuck? When are those coming out? So what I've decided to do today
[218.62s -> 221.66s]  is I still own ace attorney and I can still get it to work. And so we have to get a
[221.66s -> 228.44s]  new audio splitter. Here's an emulation. I don't want to talk about emulators,
[228.44s -> 236.74s]  no emulation. Not yet. I'm not talking about that yet. So what I've decided to do is because
[236.74s -> 242.07s]  Super Bowls today, I went through, I jumped through a bunch of hoops and I was able to
[242.07s -> 253.21s]  get this. Well, hold on. There's like a logo on here. I don't want, I don't want like a,
[254.17s -> 259.82s]  hold on. There's like a, I don't want to show this thing. Oh, give me a second.
[264.89s -> 275.06s]  It's like two logos on here. All right. Well, you know what? We'll just show the back.
[275.06s -> 280.02s]  No, I was going to go like this. So this is what I was able to get today. Like let's rewind.
[280.02s -> 285.80s]  Okay. So after all, I was going to play a ace attorney and I jumped through a bunch of hoops
[286.44s -> 297.21s]  and I was able to get this. I just blitzed the league too. One of my favorite games of
[297.21s -> 302.73s]  all time on the old generation console. So you're probably asking yourself, I mean it is,
[302.73s -> 307.13s]  it is Patriots Day, right? It is like the Patriots are like gone. So I made sure to get
[307.13s -> 313.69s]  my Patriots clothes on today. Hey, can you tell? I knew it was a fucking goddamn Superbowl.
[323.62s -> 338.47s]  10% of my wardrobe guys. Do you understand? Go Patriots. It's desynced, which shouldn't be.
[338.47s -> 352.28s]  What? You're going to desync me? Oh, it is desync. What a piece of crap. Hold on. But
[352.28s -> 356.28s]  yeah, uh, blitz the league too. It even blitz the league. If you guys didn't know,
[358.49s -> 365.61s]  this is where Mortal Kombat got their horrible, break the person's neck closeup blood comes out
[365.61s -> 372.79s]  of their mouth animations. This is not a regular football game by a long shot.
[374.02s -> 379.46s]  This is the game where all those crazy brutal things that happen in Mortal Kombat,
[379.46s -> 385.62s]  this is where they came from. Same company. This game is fucking hilarious. It's amazing.
[385.70s -> 392.10s]  And I got it today. I got this today. I activated Jax powers and I got, well, I had some help,
[392.10s -> 400.71s]  but you know. How do I put this in? I don't believe you. Is it Mortal Kombat older?
[401.99s -> 407.59s]  Mortal Kombat's zoom in. You'll see what I'm talking about. Once I like punch a guy in the
[407.59s -> 412.63s]  nuts and like his balls explode, like that, I'm not, I'm just saying that that happens in
[412.63s -> 422.76s]  this game because it does. You'll understand. How do I, I'm not used to this PlayStation.
[424.15s -> 431.42s]  This is all very quick. We got this set up immediately. Who scored? Nobody. It's still
[431.42s -> 436.54s]  three down. I don't know how to put the disc inside of this PlayStation. I'm not kidding.
[436.54s -> 446.49s]  This is bad. How do I open this? Does this have discs? Anybody know how to do this?
[455.80s -> 467.75s]  Where do I put the disc in? It's on the left. Just push it in. It's not on the left.
[469.93s -> 473.13s]  Wait a minute. Hold on. Somebody help me. Hold on. I gotta move some stuff.
[473.13s -> 492.79s]  Is there a disc in there? No, there's no disc in there already. For a second, I thought
[493.43s -> 499.24s]  stupid invaders was in here. Where's the, wait, wait, wait. Let's go. Okay. No, I got it.
[507.69s -> 514.39s]  No. All right. I'm turning the fucking webcam on. You guys have to help me here.
[515.59s -> 530.04s]  I don't get it. I don't get it. You ready? How do I, how the fuck do I put a disc in
[530.04s -> 558.31s]  here? Where does it go? There's nothing here. There's nothing there. Slide it. I've never
[558.87s -> 574.44s]  seen a PlayStation like that. I'll slide the top open. No way. Slide it open. Oh, fuck my
[574.44s -> 586.26s]  camera. We had to activate Jax this morning. I have a controller, right? Okay. Let's delete
[586.26s -> 596.41s]  two going in into the weird like Willy Wonka machine. What? I've owned like three different
[596.41s -> 607.96s]  PlayStation 3s. I've never seen a slide the top. Here we go. Welcome to Blitz the League.
[607.96s -> 617.02s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't do that. Welcome to Blitz the League 2,
[618.54s -> 628.25s]  right? If there's something wrong with this disc, the last hour was jumping through hoops
[628.25s -> 642.60s]  to get this. Oh, thank God. Anybody score? Who has the ball? A mandatory game data install
[642.60s -> 649.58s]  is required for Blitz. Yeah. Please don't turn off the fucking PlayStation. Oops. Wait, what?
[652.74s -> 676.79s]  Oh, shit. I forgot. Where's this camera even pointing? This camera sucks. You know who's
[676.79s -> 685.61s]  got a real monopoly on the video camera industry? Logitech. They are, they are the
[685.61s -> 697.77s]  Kleenex of cameras. It's bullshit. There's like four cameras stalling. No, I got 17%. I don't
[697.77s -> 703.78s]  want you to, I don't want you guys to know what the percentage is. Just use a cam link
[703.78s -> 711.53s]  and a real camera. I don't want to like hook up a DSLR up here. I don't, I don't,
[711.53s -> 714.81s]  do you guys think I, what would you think? I want you to see my face in like 4k.
[717.70s -> 725.11s]  You think sometimes I look fucked up now. Imagine what I would look like in every
[725.11s -> 731.32s]  pore, every pocket of my face being shown. No, you're not getting the Ren and Stimpy
[731.32s -> 745.69s]  close-up camera on my face. I'm sorry, guys. What are we at? 31. Who has the ball? The,
[745.69s -> 752.01s]  I can't believe I forgot the fucking Super Bowl was today. And it was like a perfect,
[752.01s -> 754.81s]  it was a perfect opportunity. So I streamed the last two days in a row. This is three
[754.81s -> 758.89s]  days in a row, right? I was gonna, oh, maybe I'll take today off. I would have like
[758.89s -> 764.68s]  probably watched the Super Bowl, but I can't even watch the Super Bowl. So uneven side
[764.68s -> 768.60s]  brides. That's not true. I tried as hard as I could in the morning to shape them. See,
[768.60s -> 776.34s]  look one, two, right in the right spot. I mean, I may have ripped, I may have butchered
[776.34s -> 784.17s]  this side a little. They're not uneven. They're just unorganized. There's a difference.
[784.73s -> 793.38s]  They're actually uneven. No, they're just unorganized. They're uneven as fuck. No,
[793.38s -> 797.46s]  they're not. They are, they're just, they just don't look right because I need a haircut.
[797.46s -> 801.80s]  And when I get a haircut, they just, they take them out. Speaking of haircuts,
[803.06s -> 811.96s]  I need to get one of those too. They actually are uneven. I can't buy, I can't buy,
[814.06s -> 819.34s]  the camera's right here. You guys are right here. Video game is here. OBS preview is over
[819.34s -> 822.78s]  here right now. I can't, there's no way I can fucking do this. I'd have to go into the
[822.78s -> 842.23s]  bathroom, cut your own hair. What's the percentage? 65. He shouldn't, I don't know.
[842.23s -> 845.66s]  I think it might have something, you know what I think it is? So I don't know about you
[845.66s -> 850.06s]  guys, but I have like, I have like an uneven face. So when I'm like turning and looking
[850.06s -> 854.06s]  this way, going like this, my eyes are in a different, this eye is not in the right
[854.06s -> 858.78s]  position. It's like squished in. Then my nose is like bigger on this side. So when
[858.78s -> 862.30s]  I'm like shaving over here, I'm like blocking my view. When I'm shaving over here,
[862.30s -> 872.33s]  I have like two different viewpoints because my face is uneven. Your face is fucked up.
[878.86s -> 894.54s]  Yeah? So? Your face is fucked. No one's face is completely even. Thank you Dr. Phil.
[896.41s -> 902.55s]  Second quarter? When is the Super Bowl halftime show? Is that free? Is it free to see,
[902.55s -> 911.27s]  to watch the halftime show? Don't, doesn't every TV channel all at the same time turn
[911.27s -> 915.64s]  on the halftime show? I thought that was like legally what happens. Like you're
[915.64s -> 917.32s]  in the middle of law and order or something and it's just like,
[917.48s -> 923.00s]  you're in the right stuff baby I was born. It just goes to it, right? Every network.
[929.53s -> 932.89s]  Installation complete. Please quit the game through the PS button and restart. Blitz League
[932.89s -> 944.39s]  2. You got it. I hope there's enough battery in this. What am I doing? Okay, quit game. Yes.
[947.90s -> 951.34s]  It's free on the CBS website, but I'll go to jail if I play that, right?
[951.34s -> 956.23s]  On stream. You can't do that on stream. That's the quickest way to go to jail.
[958.55s -> 970.52s]  Look at those pores. Shut up. Any score? Who has the ball? Patriots have the ball. It's
[970.52s -> 981.50s]  3-0. Did they get a field goal? I need play-by-play from you guys. High definition HD gaming.
[981.50s -> 990.71s]  Here we go. I'm so excited. This game is amazing. Touchdown? Can you get 100% of
[990.71s -> 998.82s]  the trophies from me? Blitz League 2. Not rated. Interaction's not rated by the ESRB.
[999.62s -> 1002.66s]  So they're talking about when guys get like punched in the balls and they explode. That's
[1002.66s -> 1013.46s]  what they're talking about. They can't rate that. By the way, there's no actual NFL teams in this
[1013.46s -> 1023.45s]  game. It's like the Boston Brew House. It's like the Cincinnati Steelers. There's no actual
[1023.45s -> 1031.26s]  licensed teams. I can't wait to play this. Okay, so let's go ahead. We're probably
[1031.26s -> 1035.50s]  going to get this whole thing claimed from the... We probably need to turn that off.
[1039.19s -> 1046.49s]  Yeah, we have to turn this. We have to turn this off. I'm sorry, guys,
[1046.49s -> 1055.77s]  but the whole VOD's going to get muted. The rest of this is fine. Difficulty? Yeah,
[1055.77s -> 1061.53s]  no vibration. Get that out of here. Video? Brightness is fine. I don't remember exactly how
[1061.53s -> 1071.80s]  to play, but I know some things. We can do training camp. No, I gotta do the Super Bowl
[1071.80s -> 1081.83s]  right now. It's going on right now. No, training camp. Receiving defense. Yeah, you
[1081.83s -> 1086.92s]  have to stick syringes in your players and stuff. All right, we're going to do
[1087.64s -> 1093.69s]  watch and learn how to be a pro. Rushing. It's a game of inches. Let's just... I gotta remind
[1093.69s -> 1103.43s]  my brain. You got like three hours. That shit's going to go on forever. No, dude,
[1103.43s -> 1108.15s]  it's already almost halftime. This stream can only be as long as the Super Bowl.
[1108.79s -> 1112.55s]  And then I gotta get off all my Super Bowl Patriots gear and turn the stream off.
[1113.45s -> 1118.71s]  It won't look right. All right, superstar, you look ready to go. This should be easy
[1118.71s -> 1122.15s]  enough. Just take the handoff and bang out a few yards. Press X to hike the ball,
[1122.23s -> 1132.50s]  gain 10 yards. That's a burst down. That is the way to execute. I think some people are
[1132.50s -> 1138.66s]  going to come to the stream and not understand. Power move. How do you do a power move?
[1140.98s -> 1149.98s]  And that's what we call a top down. This game is so good. Evade.
[1150.14s -> 1157.64s]  Let's see if you can juke the pros. Looking good. Don't let up now.
[1159.38s -> 1163.22s]  I'm so sad they didn't make a new one. It's freestyle time. So that's a freestyle.
[1164.82s -> 1174.23s]  So right stick is... Good job. It's almost showtime, baby.
[1175.67s -> 1179.35s]  Just wait. Just wait. It doesn't matter. I don't know anything about football. All I
[1179.35s -> 1183.75s]  know is the Patriots are good. Tom Brady's cool. Tom Brady wins. Rings. That's all I
[1183.75s -> 1189.29s]  know. I don't know anything else. I know first down means that they get to play it again,
[1189.29s -> 1196.09s]  right? It's like getting... It's like re-spins. I just made a casino reference. Why did I do that?
[1196.09s -> 1208.22s]  I don't even like the casino. The casino sucks. Okay, how do I do that? First down.
[1212.07s -> 1218.79s]  Okay, hold down L2 to enter clash mode and use evade or power to make a clash move. This
[1218.79s -> 1225.06s]  is what we're talking about here. Yep. See? I can slow down time and shit.
[1230.15s -> 1235.19s]  Each clash icon adds a pip to your unleash meter. Finish filling your unleash meter
[1235.19s -> 1246.46s]  by performing a two-move combo in clash. There's one. There's two. There's three.
[1246.46s -> 1250.22s]  Look at the dumb shit you can do. So now I can break somebody's neck.
[1253.34s -> 1258.46s]  Every damn penny. Get out there and unleash on the first offender that gets in your way.
[1258.46s -> 1261.74s]  Score a rushing touchdown and then enter the following code. X, X, X, circle.
[1262.86s -> 1289.34s]  That guy dove from all the way across the fucking map. Oh! What's the code? I told you
[1289.34s -> 1298.14s]  that's nothing. Oh god. This is... Outstanding. I want five more just like that.
[1302.22s -> 1309.10s]  That guy just landed on his back very, very... It was like pillows. He had other issues going on.
[1309.10s -> 1320.70s]  I didn't do that. All right, let's do some passing training. If I jumped as high as I could and
[1320.70s -> 1325.98s]  landed directly on my back as flat as I could, that wouldn't happen to me. My stomach wouldn't
[1325.98s -> 1337.29s]  explode. Yeah, it's so fun to... Time to test out that arm of yours. Keep it simple. Just hit
[1337.29s -> 1346.15s]  the first open receiver you see. Tap as a lob. Hold it down for a bullet. That's not bad. He knows
[1346.15s -> 1354.34s]  what he's doing. Clash after your quarterback evade blitzes. Run it by gaining yards and scoring
[1354.34s -> 1370.17s]  on offense. Yeah. Gain 30 yards to fill part of the clash meter. That was poetry in motion.
[1370.17s -> 1373.69s]  Keep it up. This sounds like young German. Okay, so you have a good arm, but how are
[1373.69s -> 1376.97s]  your feet? I am young. Think you can avoid getting planted during the blitz?
[1377.61s -> 1380.97s]  Pressing L2 to enter clash. When defenders are in range,
[1380.97s -> 1385.21s]  arrows will appear. Move the right stick towards an arrow to evade.
[1386.81s -> 1398.78s]  You can do better than that? Oh, it sounds like young you. What? That was weak sauce and you
[1398.78s -> 1403.90s]  know it. Give me something better, something spicy. Yeah, he sounds like young.
[1408.42s -> 1413.53s]  Weak sauce and you know it. Give me something better, something spicy. This is John Travolta.
[1414.49s -> 1421.11s]  No, um, what's his name? There it is. All right.
[1423.66s -> 1428.97s]  That was just what I was looking for. Not John. What's his name? John Cusack. You've got the D pissed
[1428.97s -> 1434.33s]  off now and they're coming for you. All right, execute QB, unleash evade and move the right
[1434.33s -> 1441.94s]  stick towards an arrow when a defender's in range. Maybe you should try out for basketball.
[1441.94s -> 1445.62s]  I think I'm gonna snap this guy's neck. When you get unleashed, that's how you do the
[1445.62s -> 1450.34s]  horrible shit. This isn't college anymore, kid. You have to produce.
[1459.82s -> 1463.42s]  Show me what you've got. Towards the, towards the rusher, right?
[1466.09s -> 1468.73s]  This isn't college anymore, kid. You have to produce.
[1476.62s -> 1484.06s]  You're not even going to make the practice squad at this rate. How the fuck do I do that?
[1486.50s -> 1490.50s]  I mean, it's probably a really strange time. I know you can do better than that.
[1491.96s -> 1500.17s]  It's Jay Moore. Who did I say? I said somebody completely wrong. Who did I say this was?
[1500.97s -> 1504.09s]  The arrow? Yeah, I gotta wait for the arrow, but it's like, it pops up in a tenth of a second.
[1504.09s -> 1512.18s]  I gotta go towards the arrow. Like, I hit him so hard that I electrocuted his brain.
[1516.78s -> 1521.62s]  I didn't get tackled. Looking good. Don't let up now. You're looking like
[1521.62s -> 1524.34s]  the real deal, kid. All right, square passing touchdown. Now it's time to put all the pieces
[1524.34s -> 1528.50s]  together and give the fans a real show. Get in that end zone. Oh shit, I have to catch it.
[1528.90s -> 1536.60s]  What? Oh, I didn't do the code. I got tackled. Square, square, triangle, triangle.
[1539.06s -> 1555.13s]  That's a touchdown though. All right. Square, square.
[1559.22s -> 1567.27s]  Why am I doing this to my own teammate? That wasn't my own teammate.
[1570.52s -> 1575.16s]  It was like cartoon and punches. All right. Rushing, passing. We got that pretty much down.
[1575.16s -> 1582.86s]  This is very quick. They don't make games like this anymore. You know, when you could
[1582.86s -> 1586.94s]  just punch people on the other team or on your own team for that matter.
[1589.61s -> 1597.35s]  51 seconds left in the second quarter. And oh boy, third and two at the LA 40.
[1599.00s -> 1602.20s]  Like anyone cares. Word around here is you have hands like flypaper. Well,
[1602.20s -> 1604.12s]  put the ball in the air and show me what you can do.
[1605.00s -> 1611.88s]  An open receiver. That's what I'm seeing here, kid. That was a nice catch, but let's see how
[1611.88s -> 1615.08s]  you do under real pressure. So you do a clash catch. Take some of your clash energy and
[1615.08s -> 1625.94s]  make sure you come down with the pass. Catch must be at least 20 yards. Okay. Got it.
[1628.44s -> 1635.83s]  And I broke the tackle too. I'm still good. Now that is the way to execute. It's fourth
[1635.83s -> 1640.31s]  and long here. So what are we going to do? Press and hold L2 while the ball is in the air
[1640.31s -> 1651.08s]  to enter clash. Catch that deep ball. Yeah, it's a guaranteed catch if you have full meter.
[1651.08s -> 1656.86s]  Don't let up now. That end zone is calling to you. Haul ass downfield and give the
[1656.86s -> 1660.94s]  networks their play of the week. Hold L2, the ball's in the air, press triangle to make
[1660.94s -> 1663.82s]  the intended receiver do an unleashed catch when the ball is in range.
[1665.18s -> 1685.50s]  Uh, I didn't do it. These guys have made out of peanut brittle. These bones have made it a
[1685.50s -> 1694.55s]  candy floss. It's so delayed. The bones break like five seconds later. They have pretty bad
[1694.55s -> 1701.61s]  lag. All right. So I have to make them do it. So like this.
[1703.11s -> 1710.26s]  There we go. No, I was trying to hurt that guy. Freaking standing. What's a touchdown without
[1710.26s -> 1712.58s]  a good celebration? We're receiving touchdown then do XX circle circle. Get in the end zone,
[1712.58s -> 1722.17s]  pick a spot and show the fans your moves. No. Is it halftime? All right. Who's the
[1722.17s -> 1731.30s]  halftime show? Oh, it's halftime. No, that's going to be embarrassing. Nevermind.
[1737.58s -> 1743.24s]  And then what was it? XX square square? I don't remember what it was. Give us a
[1743.24s -> 1752.33s]  halftime show. Uh, I can't, I can't do a, I don't, I'm not prepared for this.
[1768.50s -> 1782.49s]  That's a fail. Why? XX circle circle, not square. Damn it. Beer chuck.
[1786.44s -> 1789.98s]  That's a $50,000 penalty. That one's a keeper. Great job.
[1793.06s -> 1797.06s]  Is that allowed in football? Uh, no, no, and none of it is actually.
[1798.76s -> 1802.12s]  Pain, injuries, glory. This is where we get to see the real pain.
[1802.84s -> 1807.99s]  The whole point of blitz the league is you're trying to make the other team injured.
[1807.99s -> 1813.37s]  You're trying to put people out, hurt them to a point where they can't play in the game anymore.
[1813.37s -> 1816.81s]  That's the point of this game. That's not the point of American football.
[1817.45s -> 1826.44s]  Looks like the offense is trying to pass on you. Are you going to take that?
[1826.44s -> 1829.00s]  X while tackling the ball carrier. Don't show those receivers what happens when they
[1829.00s -> 1834.12s]  try and catch a pass in your territory. I'm sorry. I thought you said you had skills.
[1834.12s -> 1837.16s]  Well, I need to know how to select a guy. Press X while tackling the ball carrier. So
[1837.96s -> 1842.20s]  where's my character? Hey, why don't you get your damn head in the game and try again?
[1842.20s -> 1850.44s]  Um, I, you need to tell me who I'm, where my character is. How do I select a new character?
[1851.56s -> 1856.79s]  Real deal. Looks like the switch into the run.
[1856.79s -> 1863.82s]  Press and hold L2 and press X to execute a dirty hit. That's what we want right here.
[1863.82s -> 1869.42s]  Dirty hit. That is the way to execute. Those fat linemen are trying to get in your face.
[1870.38s -> 1871.82s]  Like the lard asses they are.
[1884.76s -> 1887.88s]  That's a success. Nothing brings in the ratings like a sack.
[1891.96s -> 1895.40s]  Damn it. I didn't get any more kid. You have to produce.
[1897.00s -> 1899.05s]  It's not going to be ready. You got to go run right through.
[1906.04s -> 1909.48s]  You had skills. Now prove it. I'm also trying to do it. I don't have any time.
[1914.25s -> 1924.30s]  He's too good. He like gets rid of the ball immediately.
[1932.04s -> 1935.32s]  I know I'm the defender, but look at how quickly he gets rid of the ball.
[1938.86s -> 1941.10s]  Sack him. Sack him. That counts.
[1946.94s -> 1947.58s]  Give me this guy.
[1961.05s -> 1966.17s]  All right, he throws the ball. By the time my character takes a step, the ball's gone.
[1977.32s -> 1987.30s]  Are you using L2? Oh yeah. Jesus Christ.
[2001.13s -> 2005.53s]  Guys, I'm doing it correctly. I'm holding L2 and press. I've played this game before.
[2006.49s -> 2011.29s]  The tutorial. How is that a fail? I sack the quarterback.
[2019.24s -> 2021.40s]  It's just the tutorial. They forgot to program the
[2021.48s -> 2023.64s]  quarterback to hold the ball for more than a tenth of a second.
[2025.37s -> 2032.38s]  I'm sorry. I thought you said you had skills. Now prove it.
[2033.42s -> 2034.82s]  What the fuck?
[2047.53s -> 2055.85s]  I'm going to go with another guy. I don't know. Why am I getting failures for sacking
[2055.85s -> 2065.83s]  the quarterback? All right. Do you see how fast he's throwing this ball?
[2065.83s -> 2075.46s]  And she's in a nursing home. Pathetic. That counts. That's a dirty hit. Jesus.
[2075.78s -> 2082.76s]  Christ. Time to make the ball carrier cry for his mama. Unleash on him with everything you've got.
[2082.76s -> 2090.47s]  All right. Unleash all the ball character press. Yeah, I got it. Suplex him on his head.
[2092.94s -> 2096.52s]  Oh, that guy's. You nailed that one. Keep going.
[2100.42s -> 2103.67s]  We didn't break any bones or hurt him. All right. Last thing.
[2104.31s -> 2106.87s]  And then we're going to do career mode. I'm going to do the whole career in the time
[2106.87s -> 2120.76s]  to take for. Who is the halftime show? Have we figured it out? SpongeBob.
[2122.62s -> 2126.26s]  It's not SpongeBob. Although that would be great if it was.
[2126.26s -> 2129.06s]  If you're going to play dirty, you need to learn to call your shots.
[2129.06s -> 2134.58s]  Hit the ball carrier hard. Pick the body part of your choice and make sure he doesn't get.
[2134.58s -> 2138.34s]  Oh, yeah. SpongeBob is the halftime show. That is absolute bullshit.
[2139.22s -> 2144.52s]  Perform dirty hit. Pick an injury using left and then pump it up by rapidly pressing X.
[2147.72s -> 2154.84s]  Step on it. Oh, OK. Right. I see. I see. That was weak.
[2155.48s -> 2158.68s]  I remember this. You have to, like, pick a place and then spam X.
[2163.05s -> 2169.35s]  You should try out for basketball. That guy ran into his own teammate.
[2183.10s -> 2189.37s]  Yeah. Bruce, those ribs. That was poetry in motion. Keep it up. Injuries happen.
[2189.37s -> 2192.33s]  That's why the training staff has a ready supply of juice.
[2192.33s -> 2195.53s]  Take aim, find the vein and get your comrade back on the field.
[2195.53s -> 2198.97s]  Position your syringe using left and then juice the injured player by pressing X.
[2198.97s -> 2201.69s]  Get a 50% or better result.
[2211.22s -> 2214.82s]  Here we go. Yes. You get steroids.
[2218.68s -> 2222.20s]  OK, here we go. Use a left stick to place the needle as close to the middle of target as
[2222.20s -> 2226.12s]  possible. The closer you get to the center, the quicker your player will get back into the
[2226.12s -> 2243.74s]  game. That was just what I was looking for. Sometimes the Jews just get in the middle.
[2243.74s -> 2248.06s]  You got to grab hold of what's broken and wrench it back into place.
[2248.06s -> 2251.50s]  Allow your player to get in and pull left and right to prepare for a bone set.
[2253.78s -> 2257.46s]  Then move left and right in indicated directions when prompted. Get a 50% or better.
[2257.86s -> 2265.67s]  Oh, that's a broken shoulder portion.
[2271.75s -> 2275.51s]  OK, move the left stick and right stick to their respected targets.
[2276.15s -> 2280.31s]  Once the targets are in place, mimic the arrows that appear to snap the bone back into place.
[2289.82s -> 2291.90s]  Sorry, dude. Sorry, dude.
[2292.70s -> 2294.46s]  Great intensity on that one. Keep going.
[2295.66s -> 2299.06s]  So I know how to play. Let's do it.
[2301.74s -> 2312.01s]  He's ready. So there are lots of things. We got campaign.
[2314.74s -> 2317.22s]  Oh, God. That's a whole storyline here.
[2317.22s -> 2319.78s]  Battaglia levels the quarterback. It's a fumble.
[2319.78s -> 2328.52s]  Football was coach thinking. Ten seconds left in a tie game.
[2328.52s -> 2331.64s]  And the Nightmare cough up the football on their own 20.
[2332.60s -> 2338.68s]  Frank Kelly. Is that the John Madden guy?
[2339.72s -> 2342.90s]  Got this one in the bag, sunshine.
[2342.90s -> 2344.90s]  The quarterback is down.
[2344.90s -> 2347.38s]  Looks like Battaglia may have ended his career.
[2347.94s -> 2349.46s]  It wouldn't be the first time.
[2351.06s -> 2352.10s]  Quit your whining.
[2354.10s -> 2355.22s]  Just stick him with a syringe.
[2371.80s -> 2373.56s]  Seamless transition into gameplay. Let's go.
[2374.60s -> 2381.72s]  I don't know how to kick a ball, though.
[2382.44s -> 2385.56s]  I have no idea how to kick a ball. There wasn't a tutorial for that.
[2389.59s -> 2401.27s]  Oh, yeah. It's a fumble.
[2401.27s -> 2402.07s]  It's a fumble.
[2414.46s -> 2420.98s]  Neck break. So face mask running the whole time.
[2420.98s -> 2444.42s]  You'd be thrown out of the league to see Kingpin up in the...
[2444.42s -> 2445.78s]  Kid, you're going to be huge.
[2445.78s -> 2448.26s]  The first two-way player this league's ever seen.
[2448.26s -> 2452.10s]  I've got every Fortune 500 company panting to get into bed with you.
[2452.10s -> 2454.50s]  Like horny bridesmaids at the wedding of the century.
[2454.50s -> 2456.18s]  Do you really want to rock the boat?
[2461.61s -> 2464.01s]  Okay, kid, we're fucking on.
[2464.81s -> 2470.44s]  Excuse me, commissioner.
[2470.44s -> 2471.64s]  I wanted to introduce you to my new client.
[2471.64s -> 2472.76s]  Great to meet you, son.
[2473.32s -> 2475.56s]  Boys, take a look at our next big star.
[2475.56s -> 2476.12s]  Big star?
[2476.12s -> 2479.16s]  Is this like the opening GTA cinematic?
[2479.16s -> 2480.68s]  He's a one-man-walking franchise.
[2480.68s -> 2483.32s]  Hey, you know what? That's his new nickname, franchise.
[2483.32s -> 2484.68s]  Well, it's the evil mafia guy.
[2486.52s -> 2489.00s]  Franchise. I dig that.
[2491.32s -> 2494.44s]  Well, you'll certainly be the franchise player for the riot.
[2494.92s -> 2497.40s]  L.A. traded up to the number one pick to take you.
[2498.44s -> 2499.32s]  I don't like that voice.
[2499.32s -> 2500.12s]  I'm sorry, sir.
[2500.12s -> 2500.68s]  Not evil.
[2500.68s -> 2501.88s]  I won't be able to play for L.A.
[2509.24s -> 2510.84s]  Good one, sir. Good one.
[2510.84s -> 2511.72s]  It's no joke.
[2511.72s -> 2514.60s]  The only place I'm going to be able to play is in my hometown.
[2514.60s -> 2517.24s]  You'll play for the team that drafts you.
[2517.24s -> 2520.28s]  I'm sorry about this, but my mind's made up.
[2520.28s -> 2522.52s]  SpongeBob is not home.
[2522.52s -> 2524.36s]  Then he'll go play center field for New York.
[2524.36s -> 2528.52s]  They just offered him $17 million a year for seven years, guaranteed.
[2528.52s -> 2530.76s]  That's the kind of athlete you're looking at here.
[2531.88s -> 2539.35s]  Look, everybody knows you expanded your league too quickly.
[2539.35s -> 2541.03s]  I mean, six teams in five years.
[2541.03s -> 2541.43s]  Come on.
[2541.43s -> 2542.63s]  Now you're choking on it.
[2542.63s -> 2546.23s]  And your so-called owners raised the money for those new teams.
[2546.23s -> 2548.55s]  So you had to offer stock to the public.
[2548.55s -> 2553.99s]  And now you get a once in a lifetime cash cow who could save your league.
[2554.55s -> 2555.03s]  SpongeBob.
[2555.03s -> 2557.99s]  All he's asking for is to play for his hometown team.
[2557.99s -> 2562.07s]  SpongeBob is in the halftime.
[2563.67s -> 2570.79s]  They're doing sweet victory.
[2571.19s -> 2572.31s]  Thank you all for coming.
[2572.31s -> 2573.03s]  Today's a special day.
[2573.03s -> 2573.75s]  Are you kidding me?
[2573.75s -> 2574.39s]  My client.
[2574.39s -> 2575.91s]  I thought you guys were just fucking around.
[2575.91s -> 2580.39s]  Most of you have been following his career as he smashed multiple collegiate records.
[2580.39s -> 2582.79s]  Now he's poised through the sand in the league.
[2582.79s -> 2584.87s]  So let's get the questions rolling.
[2584.87s -> 2585.99s]  Fogs one at a time.
[2585.99s -> 2587.75s]  Scott Smith, League Tribune.
[2587.75s -> 2590.31s]  How do you feel your presence on offense affects your teammates?
[2590.87s -> 2593.59s]  How do you feel your presence on offense affects your teammates?
[2593.59s -> 2596.55s]  I like to go out there and deliver good passes and let my playmakers do the work.
[2597.27s -> 2600.87s]  As a running back, I know that I need to go out there and control the game.
[2600.87s -> 2602.63s]  They can rely on me to make the big catch.
[2602.63s -> 2605.75s]  I have the versatility to line up and block or split out wide.
[2605.75s -> 2606.39s]  What do I want to do?
[2608.60s -> 2610.12s]  I think isn't quarterback the most fun?
[2611.00s -> 2616.52s]  Quarterbacks like the most fun in a football game.
[2616.52s -> 2619.05s]  I'd go out there and deliver the passes.
[2619.05s -> 2623.05s]  I like to go out there and deliver good passes and let my playmakers do the work.
[2623.69s -> 2624.97s]  The man is a playmaker.
[2624.97s -> 2625.69s]  Pure and simple.
[2625.69s -> 2626.73s]  Next question.
[2626.73s -> 2628.73s]  Now you're going to play offense and defense.
[2631.61s -> 2633.77s]  I'm a threat to the quarterback every play.
[2634.73s -> 2636.01s]  Uh, they can't contain me.
[2636.01s -> 2639.37s]  Any run or short yardage pass that enters my territory is going to be,
[2639.37s -> 2640.25s]  they're going to pay a price.
[2641.21s -> 2642.89s]  I'm the general of the secondary.
[2642.89s -> 2644.25s]  I'm everywhere I need to be.
[2644.25s -> 2645.21s]  I want that safety.
[2646.09s -> 2648.65s]  I'm the ultimate shutdown corner throwing to my receiver.
[2648.65s -> 2650.81s]  Nobody, I, I don't know what any of this means,
[2650.81s -> 2652.41s]  but I know that I want to be a safety.
[2653.29s -> 2654.17s]  I want to be the general.
[2654.17s -> 2655.93s]  I want to be the quarterback and I want to be the general.
[2655.93s -> 2657.37s]  And I want to be done safely.
[2657.37s -> 2659.37s]  I'm the general of the secondary.
[2659.37s -> 2660.81s]  I'm everywhere I need to be.
[2661.53s -> 2663.61s]  As you can see, confidence isn't an issue.
[2663.77s -> 2664.41s]  Who's next?
[2664.41s -> 2666.17s]  How about the looker in the front row?
[2666.17s -> 2667.21s]  Jennifer Mendez.
[2667.21s -> 2670.41s]  My readers are wondering what did you do for fun in your youth?
[2670.41s -> 2675.61s]  Uh, does running from the, I was best dodgeball mostly.
[2677.99s -> 2680.97s]  Um, what do I want?
[2680.97s -> 2681.69s]  Speed?
[2681.69s -> 2682.09s]  Strength?
[2682.81s -> 2685.77s]  I want agility.
[2686.97s -> 2690.01s]  I was the best dodgeball player in my neighborhood.
[2690.97s -> 2691.93s]  Plus two agility.
[2694.10s -> 2697.54s]  Little did the old neighborhood know they had a future super store on their hands.
[2697.54s -> 2698.10s]  Okay.
[2698.10s -> 2700.26s]  How about the gentleman in the back with his hand up?
[2700.98s -> 2701.46s]  Thanks.
[2701.46s -> 2703.06s]  Did you play any other sports in college?
[2703.62s -> 2704.58s]  Uh, we got base.
[2704.58s -> 2706.26s]  My curveball could have gotten me in pros.
[2706.98s -> 2708.42s]  Collegiate champion wrestler.
[2709.22s -> 2710.26s]  Track and field.
[2710.26s -> 2712.02s]  I played rugby as well as football.
[2712.02s -> 2713.22s]  Twice the pain.
[2713.22s -> 2713.72s]  Ooh.
[2715.00s -> 2715.32s]  Yep.
[2715.32s -> 2717.64s]  I play rugby as well as football.
[2717.64s -> 2718.92s]  Twice the pain.
[2718.92s -> 2719.88s]  You know, I want a good tackle.
[2719.88s -> 2720.92s]  I want to be able to hurt people.
[2720.92s -> 2723.40s]  This kid could have gone pro in a half dozen sports.
[2723.40s -> 2725.24s]  He's just that type of athlete.
[2725.24s -> 2725.88s]  Okay.
[2725.88s -> 2726.52s]  Next.
[2726.52s -> 2728.52s]  Jeff Jones, Midwest One News.
[2728.52s -> 2731.40s]  What's the thing most opponents don't realize about you?
[2731.40s -> 2732.28s]  I'm a team player.
[2732.28s -> 2733.32s]  I'll do the dirty work.
[2733.32s -> 2734.44s]  Glory doesn't matter.
[2734.44s -> 2735.08s]  Just the win.
[2736.20s -> 2737.72s]  I studied martial arts.
[2737.72s -> 2739.72s]  I know just where to hit them to make it hurt.
[2739.72s -> 2740.44s]  I think that's the one.
[2741.16s -> 2743.08s]  My hands are like flypaper once I've got the ball.
[2743.08s -> 2743.80s]  I'm holding on to it.
[2743.80s -> 2744.60s]  Catching me is one thing.
[2744.60s -> 2745.96s]  Bring me down is a whole different story.
[2746.76s -> 2748.12s]  I studied martial arts.
[2748.76s -> 2750.28s]  I studied martial arts.
[2750.28s -> 2752.28s]  So I know just where to hit them to make it hurt.
[2752.84s -> 2754.60s]  They'll be learning soon enough, huh?
[2754.60s -> 2756.52s]  Let's get someone who has not been called on yet.
[2756.52s -> 2757.96s]  I watch anime.
[2757.96s -> 2760.20s]  What have you been focusing on in the off season?
[2763.64s -> 2765.16s]  Hitting the blocking sled.
[2765.88s -> 2767.80s]  Full contact drills.
[2767.80s -> 2769.64s]  Running the obstacle course on a one-on-one.
[2773.59s -> 2773.91s]  Maybe.
[2775.27s -> 2779.70s]  I think any more strength.
[2779.70s -> 2781.06s]  Oh, no, maybe full contact.
[2781.06s -> 2783.27s]  Block, tackle.
[2783.27s -> 2784.47s]  No, what's BKT?
[2786.81s -> 2787.53s]  Back tackle?
[2788.09s -> 2791.50s]  I'm all about the full contact drills.
[2791.50s -> 2793.58s]  Got to train hard to play hard.
[2794.22s -> 2795.02s]  Take it from me.
[2795.02s -> 2796.22s]  This kid has been working his ass off all summer.
[2796.22s -> 2798.22s]  You're a QB with full tackle points.
[2798.22s -> 2800.22s]  He'll be ready to start day one.
[2800.22s -> 2801.34s]  Who's next?
[2801.34s -> 2803.18s]  Ms. Mendez, you have another question?
[2803.18s -> 2805.42s]  If you had to give yourself a nickname, what would it be?
[2807.18s -> 2807.74s]  Nickname.
[2808.30s -> 2812.14s]  The playmaker, the enforcer, the freak of the wall.
[2815.05s -> 2816.01s]  The enforcer.
[2816.01s -> 2817.37s]  Same as in college.
[2817.37s -> 2820.09s]  Folks can call me the enforcer.
[2820.09s -> 2821.37s]  Can we quote you on that?
[2823.21s -> 2824.66s]  Yeah, yeah, kid.
[2824.66s -> 2825.94s]  The laughing?
[2825.94s -> 2826.66s]  All right.
[2826.66s -> 2829.22s]  Looks like we only have time for a few more questions.
[2829.22s -> 2830.66s]  OK, Scott, go.
[2831.38s -> 2833.54s]  Which current player do you model your game after?
[2834.42s -> 2835.30s]  The speed demon.
[2836.74s -> 2837.54s]  Wide receiver.
[2838.18s -> 2838.90s]  The bullhawk.
[2842.17s -> 2842.81s]  Full stop.
[2843.61s -> 2844.49s]  Ezekiel.
[2844.49s -> 2845.69s]  The enforcer.
[2845.69s -> 2845.93s]  Me.
[2849.13s -> 2849.77s]  Laughback.
[2853.38s -> 2854.02s]  Running back.
[2855.46s -> 2856.18s]  The enforcer.
[2858.14s -> 2859.26s]  Don't hate me for this,
[2859.26s -> 2862.62s]  but I model my game after my boy, Bruno Bataglia.
[2862.62s -> 2864.14s]  We're just about out of time here.
[2864.14s -> 2865.74s]  Let's get in one final question.
[2865.74s -> 2867.02s]  Do an archer build.
[2867.02s -> 2867.74s]  Right there.
[2867.74s -> 2870.22s]  What do you want people to say about you five years from now?
[2870.86s -> 2873.74s]  I was one of the quickest guys to ever put on a pair of cleats.
[2873.74s -> 2876.46s]  Everything that I put my hands on, I'd bring it.
[2876.46s -> 2878.78s]  That kid could sure pack one hell of a punch.
[2879.42s -> 2881.82s]  You need a jet pack to be able to keep up with that guy.
[2882.46s -> 2882.62s]  Punching.
[2882.62s -> 2883.66s]  Five years, huh?
[2884.46s -> 2886.70s]  That kid sure packs one hell of a punch.
[2887.42s -> 2891.00s]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's all we have time for today.
[2891.00s -> 2893.16s]  And I want to thank you all for coming.
[2893.16s -> 2907.70s]  And I hope that you are as safe as I am about seeing him this coming season.
[2907.70s -> 2909.46s]  Why does it taunt me in every game?
[2910.18s -> 2913.43s]  Do I have to get taunted in every fucking game I play?
[2913.99s -> 2914.79s]  I don't know why.
[2920.39s -> 2922.87s]  Blazing fast scrambler with a lot of tackle.
[2924.57s -> 2925.69s]  First name, kid.
[2930.01s -> 2939.70s]  First name, Jax?
[2944.22s -> 2944.94s]  Overall, C.
[2949.67s -> 2950.71s]  I don't know if this is a Jax.
[2961.14s -> 2961.54s]  Frank?
[2969.67s -> 2970.79s]  Name him Pizza.
[2972.57s -> 2973.85s]  Mr. Super Bowl.
[2978.39s -> 2979.03s]  I like that.
[2979.75s -> 2980.95s]  Mr. Super Bowl.
[2982.79s -> 2984.47s]  The last name already is Franchise.
[2987.27s -> 2988.31s]  Oh, there he is.
[2988.31s -> 2990.31s]  Mr. Dave Super Bowl.
[2991.91s -> 2992.47s]  That's perfect.
[2996.98s -> 2998.90s]  But what if you never get to the Super Bowl?
[2998.90s -> 3001.58s]  Select your city.
[3001.58s -> 3001.90s]  All right.
[3001.90s -> 3002.46s]  Where is it?
[3005.19s -> 3005.43s]  Nope.
[3013.11s -> 3014.50s]  There it is.
[3014.50s -> 3015.22s]  Las Vegas.
[3016.23s -> 3017.19s]  The Las Vegas.
[3017.99s -> 3019.59s]  Oh, I get to name the team.
[3019.59s -> 3020.39s]  The Las Vegas.
[3021.43s -> 3022.97s]  The Las Vegas Aces.
[3026.28s -> 3027.24s]  No, the Las...
[3027.96s -> 3028.68s]  Eat this one.
[3028.68s -> 3030.04s]  The Las Vegas Dealers.
[3040.86s -> 3042.38s]  Yeah, the Vegas Dealers.
[3045.18s -> 3046.46s]  The Vegas Boomers.
[3056.12s -> 3057.16s]  Terrible Boomer.
[3057.88s -> 3059.16s]  The Vegas Boomers.
[3059.16s -> 3060.84s]  I'm not going to be the fucking Boomers.
[3065.13s -> 3067.37s]  The Las Vegas Super Bowlers.
[3077.30s -> 3078.82s]  No, this is so dumb.
[3079.78s -> 3082.26s]  Las Vegas Super Bowlers.
[3083.22s -> 3084.34s]  I can't even fit it.
[3091.24s -> 3094.04s]  Mr. Super Bowl of the Super Bowlers.
[3111.99s -> 3113.27s]  That word doesn't look right.
[3119.59s -> 3120.71s]  Is that correct?
[3120.71s -> 3121.75s]  Bowlingles?
[3121.75s -> 3122.39s]  Is that weird?
[3123.43s -> 3123.67s]  All right.
[3123.67s -> 3125.19s]  The Las Vegas Super Bowls.
[3125.83s -> 3127.56s]  Mr. Super Bowl on the team.
[3128.36s -> 3134.42s]  Anyway, that's a pretty...
[3134.42s -> 3135.30s]  That's pretty Vegas.
[3135.86s -> 3136.82s]  Is it just a bowl?
[3137.62s -> 3140.90s]  It has to just be like a bowl, right?
[3141.62s -> 3149.67s]  A middle finger.
[3150.63s -> 3157.19s]  Mr. Super Bowl of the Super Bowlers.
[3157.75s -> 3165.58s]  All right.
[3165.58s -> 3166.46s]  These two images?
[3166.46s -> 3169.58s]  This is just evolved version of George Washington.
[3169.58s -> 3171.91s]  This is Super Saiyan Washington.
[3175.29s -> 3176.01s]  We got a club.
[3184.63s -> 3186.07s]  What the fuck is that thing?
[3186.71s -> 3189.37s]  There are too many icons.
[3190.01s -> 3192.49s]  How about just a terrible default one?
[3199.67s -> 3200.95s]  I mean, come on.
[3200.95s -> 3211.69s]  How many icons?
[3211.69s -> 3212.57s]  Okay, we got to the end.
[3213.13s -> 3215.06s]  We got to do dice.
[3215.06s -> 3215.86s]  We're in Las Vegas.
[3218.49s -> 3219.61s]  And the team colors.
[3219.61s -> 3221.69s]  We've got to be the German 985 official colors.
[3222.25s -> 3256.60s]  A little darker, I think.
[3257.40s -> 3260.68s]  Maybe a little bit lighter.
[3260.68s -> 3262.44s]  Like the light is bouncing in the right spot, you know?
[3263.16s -> 3269.86s]  Here's the uniform.
[3269.86s -> 3271.30s]  Holy fuck, that's ugly.
[3272.26s -> 3275.18s]  It's not.
[3275.18s -> 3276.38s]  That is very ugly.
[3277.82s -> 3278.62s]  Home uniform.
[3278.62s -> 3279.42s]  Helmet style.
[3294.18s -> 3295.30s]  And this is just like a...
[3297.00s -> 3299.00s]  I need to swap it so it doesn't look...
[3300.60s -> 3301.72s]  What did italics say?
[3302.54s -> 3303.34s]  Polly Pocket?
[3304.57s -> 3305.05s]  Shut up!
[3311.62s -> 3313.30s]  No, this needs to be like that.
[3317.94s -> 3318.66s]  This is fine.
[3318.66s -> 3319.06s]  Like the...
[3319.06s -> 3320.95s]  Okay, that looks cool.
[3320.95s -> 3322.31s]  I'll keep that one.
[3322.31s -> 3324.33s]  All right.
[3324.33s -> 3324.81s]  Now, how do I...
[3325.37s -> 3326.81s]  Okay. Jersey.
[3329.59s -> 3330.79s]  That looks a lot better.
[3330.79s -> 3331.11s]  Right there.
[3333.53s -> 3334.41s]  Jersey font.
[3335.70s -> 3336.42s]  Super Bowl?
[3337.14s -> 3337.38s]  What?
[3337.38s -> 3337.78s]  Oh, right.
[3337.78s -> 3338.82s]  That's the name of the team.
[3339.30s -> 3339.78s]  I thought that...
[3339.78s -> 3340.66s]  I was like, what the fuck?
[3341.22s -> 3341.78s]  I like that.
[3347.96s -> 3348.36s]  Pants?
[3352.06s -> 3352.30s]  No.
[3353.48s -> 3355.16s]  I gotta break it up a little bit.
[3355.16s -> 3355.56s]  It's got...
[3355.56s -> 3356.60s]  I gotta break it up a little.
[3356.60s -> 3357.40s]  It looks so bad.
[3358.20s -> 3359.14s]  Socks?
[3359.14s -> 3360.42s]  Where's the Star Wars socks, please?
[3361.06s -> 3369.29s]  So we got...
[3370.09s -> 3371.13s]  Mr. Super Bowl.
[3371.13s -> 3372.49s]  Captain of the Super Bowls.
[3387.42s -> 3389.58s]  He's pistachio ice cream, man.
[3392.02s -> 3393.14s]  Are we still at the halftime show?
[3393.14s -> 3394.02s]  How long is this shit?
[3394.90s -> 3395.30s]  Agent.
[3406.18s -> 3408.34s]  Keep them on the best supplements you can afford.
[3408.34s -> 3410.18s]  And don't forget about socializing.
[3410.18s -> 3411.30s]  Hit the club scene.
[3411.30s -> 3413.30s]  Make a name for yourself off the field as well.
[3441.38s -> 3441.70s]  All right.
[3441.70s -> 3442.58s]  So we got the trainer.
[3443.46s -> 3444.34s]  Roster stats.
[3444.34s -> 3445.30s]  Lifestyle.
[3445.30s -> 3447.96s]  I think you can go to jail in this game, if I remember.
[3447.96s -> 3452.18s]  You can get arrested for breaking stuff and punching people.
[3452.18s -> 3452.42s]  All right.
[3452.42s -> 3453.38s]  Wins to advance five.
[3453.38s -> 3454.02s]  Need...
[3454.02s -> 3455.94s]  I got seven division games remaining.
[3455.94s -> 3456.90s]  $100,000.
[3457.70s -> 3458.10s]  Trainer.
[3459.14s -> 3459.78s]  Juicing.
[3459.78s -> 3461.22s]  Oh, you can take drugs.
[3461.22s -> 3461.78s]  Now, okay.
[3461.78s -> 3462.18s]  Training.
[3462.82s -> 3466.23s]  Train your starting players yourself or have the team's trainer take care of it.
[3466.23s -> 3467.03s]  It's your call.
[3468.41s -> 3469.85s]  I want to do the training myself.
[3470.49s -> 3471.05s]  No, I don't.
[3471.05s -> 3472.17s]  This is way too many people.
[3474.28s -> 3475.96s]  Assign the trainers automatically.
[3476.90s -> 3477.38s]  Juicing.
[3477.94s -> 3479.86s]  You can juice up to three players each week
[3479.86s -> 3481.86s]  and different juices are more suited to different positions.
[3482.82s -> 3485.78s]  Keep an eye on your risk meter when buying illegal drugs.
[3485.78s -> 3488.74s]  As risk gets higher, so do the chances of getting busted by the league.
[3491.16s -> 3492.68s]  So should I take drugs?
[3492.68s -> 3493.00s]  No, not...
[3493.00s -> 3493.88s]  We don't need to do this.
[3493.88s -> 3494.28s]  Not yet.
[3494.28s -> 3494.68s]  Upgrades.
[3495.40s -> 3496.73s]  All right.
[3496.73s -> 3501.62s]  So for tackle, it's $105,000.
[3501.62s -> 3502.34s]  I don't have enough money.
[3502.34s -> 3502.90s]  We're just going to do it.
[3502.90s -> 3503.46s]  We're just going to play.
[3505.66s -> 3506.22s]  Lifestyle.
[3507.11s -> 3508.71s]  Girlfriends and sponsors.
[3509.75s -> 3510.94s]  These...
[3510.94s -> 3512.70s]  I haven't even made a name for myself.
[3512.70s -> 3513.18s]  Cheap Helm.
[3513.18s -> 3516.22s]  These cheaply made lids are as old as the league helmet policy.
[3516.86s -> 3518.70s]  They barely offer more protection than your skull.
[3519.42s -> 3521.77s]  So I don't have any sponsors.
[3521.77s -> 3522.33s]  Not yet.
[3522.33s -> 3523.37s]  I got to make a name for myself.
[3523.37s -> 3523.69s]  I got to...
[3523.69s -> 3524.01s]  Let's go.
[3524.97s -> 3529.62s]  Las Vegas must stay within five points at the final score to win.
[3531.48s -> 3533.48s]  I can bet money on my own team.
[3535.48s -> 3535.96s]  Max bet.
[3535.96s -> 3539.80s]  The Philadelphia Brawlers live up to their names with their style of play.
[3539.80s -> 3543.32s]  They cheat as much as they can and get away with far more than they should.
[3543.32s -> 3547.80s]  Defensive end, H.J. Latchaw was just another unruly Philly fan last year.
[3547.80s -> 3552.60s]  Until a fight spilled onto the field and Latchaw beat his ass to earn himself a child on the ball.
[3553.16s -> 3559.38s]  Pressed his history.
[3560.10s -> 3563.86s]  Just like a fat guy fan that came and beat everybody up.
[3570.18s -> 3571.94s]  Just the WWE NFL.
[3572.50s -> 3574.66s]  No, this is not an NFL.
[3574.66s -> 3577.38s]  This is the Blitz the League League.
[3578.18s -> 3583.05s]  There he is.
[3583.05s -> 3586.01s]  They got dirty defense, but they have very poor offense.
[3586.01s -> 3589.13s]  So they play dirty and they cheat, but they don't score very many points.
[3589.69s -> 3594.02s]  Remember, it's 30 yards for a first down.
[3594.02s -> 3596.02s]  You know, I was hanging out the pool this morning before the game.
[3596.58s -> 3597.06s]  There he is.
[3604.58s -> 3609.16s]  What?
[3613.16s -> 3613.66s]  Why?
[3615.64s -> 3617.00s]  Maybe I had a diaper.
[3617.00s -> 3618.28s]  Oh, I love this game.
[3618.28s -> 3621.85s]  All right, we're going to go with uh, we're going to go with a
[3623.46s -> 3625.70s]  world record trail.
[3626.74s -> 3627.94s]  Passing play.
[3627.94s -> 3635.05s]  All right, got some yards.
[3635.05s -> 3635.93s]  Got a little yardage.
[3635.93s -> 3636.43s]  Seven yards.
[3638.06s -> 3639.34s]  Las Vegas diapers.
[3639.42s -> 3642.87s]  Boy, HP float.
[3642.87s -> 3647.94s]  One of them thinks we know what the hell we're why I didn't make the away uniform.
[3649.06s -> 3651.02s]  Watch this.
[3652.52s -> 3654.04s]  I didn't do it early enough.
[3655.08s -> 3659.82s]  There's no nudity.
[3659.82s -> 3660.94s]  What are you talking about nudity?
[3660.94s -> 3662.46s]  Oh, there's people dancing in the background.
[3662.46s -> 3662.96s]  Oops.
[3663.42s -> 3664.62s]  It's all right.
[3664.62s -> 3670.30s]  This is the hotline Miami team.
[3674.10s -> 3675.46s]  Oh, you dumb ass.
[3675.46s -> 3675.94s]  God damn it.
[3675.94s -> 3676.66s]  No, I'm going for it.
[3678.31s -> 3678.87s]  I'm going for it.
[3691.19s -> 3692.15s]  And they bring him down.
[3692.15s -> 3696.70s]  Las Vegas exploits an opening in the defense for some real yardage on that play.
[3697.74s -> 3698.62s]  We'll go with speed.
[3698.62s -> 3705.93s]  Uh, let's do uh, half back, double back.
[3705.93s -> 3707.77s]  Big series of downs upcoming.
[3707.77s -> 3709.05s]  All in about the 24.
[3714.68s -> 3717.85s]  All right.
[3717.85s -> 3718.89s]  That was bullshit.
[3718.89s -> 3720.65s]  What are you guys supposed to be?
[3720.65s -> 3722.25s]  Please tell me that wasn't his knee.
[3724.89s -> 3725.93s]  Hail Mary into the end zone.
[3726.57s -> 3728.71s]  And watch this.
[3728.71s -> 3729.83s]  I'm gonna fuck his wrong quarterback.
[3735.26s -> 3740.73s]  Perfect example of why they call him whatever it is they call him.
[3742.81s -> 3743.13s]  All right.
[3743.13s -> 3744.33s]  Now I gotta, I gotta kick it.
[3744.33s -> 3745.53s]  I gotta get a field goal here.
[3746.41s -> 3746.97s]  Field goal.
[3746.97s -> 3748.09s]  Fake field goal pass.
[3748.97s -> 3750.25s]  I need, I want two points.
[3750.81s -> 3757.74s]  That's a two point conversion, ladies and gentlemen.
[3757.74s -> 3760.60s]  Regular kickoff.
[3760.60s -> 3761.40s]  I don't know how to do this though.
[3761.96s -> 3763.16s]  What the fuck is going on?
[3775.10s -> 3776.62s]  Oh, take him down.
[3777.34s -> 3781.42s]  Okay.
[3781.42s -> 3782.62s]  So I'm on defense now.
[3783.34s -> 3785.66s]  We're going to go with uh, we're going to make cover plays.
[3786.62s -> 3787.12s]  Man up.
[3788.86s -> 3789.90s]  I'm the man in the back.
[3790.38s -> 3797.50s]  No, not very many yardage.
[3797.50s -> 3798.22s]  I'm good.
[3798.22s -> 3799.66s]  First, the first quarter's already over.
[3799.66s -> 3802.70s]  The first quarter as Las Vegas leads by eight.
[3802.70s -> 3805.50s]  Why does someone's balls explode?
[3805.50s -> 3806.70s]  You just, wait.
[3807.26s -> 3808.62s]  They'll happen very shortly.
[3815.54s -> 3818.17s]  Oh fuck.
[3818.17s -> 3818.81s]  Oh fuck.
[3818.81s -> 3819.29s]  Oh fuck.
[3820.01s -> 3824.94s]  Delphia gets some monster yardage on that play.
[3829.77s -> 3830.89s]  Don't forget about the bet.
[3830.89s -> 3832.25s]  I gotta be within five points.
[3834.17s -> 3836.49s]  Oh my god.
[3836.49s -> 3837.29s]  No, no, no.
[3838.25s -> 3840.25s]  I almost got the quarterback too.
[3840.65s -> 3841.15s]  Shit.
[3844.94s -> 3845.90s]  Goal line.
[3845.90s -> 3846.70s]  Just bump.
[3847.66s -> 3848.78s]  Everybody fucking just get in there.
[3857.94s -> 3860.31s]  This one thing has the safety.
[3861.27s -> 3861.67s]  It's all right.
[3861.67s -> 3862.71s]  They're only going to get one point.
[3865.30s -> 3866.58s]  No, they're going for it.
[3866.58s -> 3867.08s]  All right.
[3867.54s -> 3875.72s]  No, you don't get it.
[3876.52s -> 3878.44s]  No such thing as pass interference in this game.
[3879.24s -> 3888.38s]  Oh, we're going to catch this.
[3889.02s -> 3890.06s]  Why doesn't everybody just get it?
[3894.33s -> 3894.73s]  Shit.
[3894.73s -> 3895.69s]  I got a time loop there.
[3896.41s -> 3900.44s]  Philadelphia has a super move where they're going to be able to hurt me real soon.
[3901.32s -> 3903.27s]  This one right here.
[3903.27s -> 3904.31s]  First down and 30.
[3904.31s -> 3904.87s]  I gotta be careful.
[3904.87s -> 3905.27s]  They could...
[3905.27s -> 3906.31s]  Something bad could happen right now.
[3908.52s -> 3909.96s]  What the fuck just happened?
[3911.64s -> 3912.28s]  Oh no.
[3912.28s -> 3912.84s]  I was trying to...
[3912.84s -> 3913.40s]  Okay.
[3913.40s -> 3914.44s]  I thought that was a running play.
[3925.34s -> 3925.74s]  Fuck.
[3925.74s -> 3927.30s]  I'm in trouble.
[3927.30s -> 3928.34s]  I'm going to have to kick a field ball.
[3930.50s -> 3930.98s]  Oh yeah.
[3930.98s -> 3932.58s]  We're tearing up the field here.
[3932.58s -> 3933.86s]  Let's do a trick play.
[3933.86s -> 3934.74s]  How about slip and dip?
[3935.70s -> 3937.70s]  I'm going with a slip and dip.
[3944.18s -> 3944.58s]  Oh no.
[3945.14s -> 3947.43s]  What did you do to my brain?
[3948.87s -> 3949.43s]  Am I dead?
[3950.47s -> 3951.43s]  Oh come on.
[3952.39s -> 3959.38s]  He turned off my brain.
[3962.86s -> 3964.01s]  It's all right.
[3964.01s -> 3964.97s]  He's only up three plays.
[3970.15s -> 3971.03s]  I brought it back to life.
[3976.14s -> 3976.38s]  All right.
[3976.38s -> 3977.10s]  I got to be careful.
[3977.10s -> 3977.50s]  I got to get...
[3977.50s -> 3978.38s]  I got to make a play here.
[3986.30s -> 3998.54s]  What?
[3998.54s -> 3999.42s]  Oh, how about stream?
[4003.18s -> 4003.82s]  Why did I do that?
[4003.82s -> 4004.54s]  Because I can.
[4005.26s -> 4008.65s]  No game.
[4008.65s -> 4010.98s]  They're taking a timeout.
[4011.54s -> 4015.30s]  What down is it?
[4016.02s -> 4016.50s]  Third down.
[4016.50s -> 4016.98s]  All right.
[4016.98s -> 4017.86s]  Let's stay...
[4017.86s -> 4020.50s]  Let's crush them with chaos.
[4021.14s -> 4021.86s]  I'm going to stay back.
[4029.80s -> 4030.20s]  Really?
[4031.00s -> 4031.80s]  You got to be kidding me.
[4032.60s -> 4034.44s]  That was two tackles that he...
[4034.44s -> 4035.24s]  He dodged them both.
[4041.86s -> 4043.14s]  He dodged two tackles?
[4043.94s -> 4048.84s]  Just fucking block it.
[4049.48s -> 4049.96s]  Get in there.
[4052.50s -> 4055.11s]  Don't mind.
[4055.11s -> 4055.75s]  All I need is one...
[4055.75s -> 4056.95s]  I need to touch it.
[4056.95s -> 4060.89s]  I need to touch it and I win the game.
[4068.78s -> 4069.10s]  All right.
[4069.10s -> 4069.42s]  Is there...
[4071.86s -> 4072.26s]  Oh no.
[4073.14s -> 4073.38s]  No.
[4073.38s -> 4074.82s]  They keep turning my brain off.
[4074.82s -> 4075.78s]  It's going to be another fumble.
[4075.78s -> 4076.18s]  Isn't it?
[4076.18s -> 4076.66s]  No.
[4076.66s -> 4083.83s]  Hold him still.
[4083.83s -> 4084.87s]  Hang on, buddy.
[4084.87s -> 4085.75s]  Only have three plays.
[4089.08s -> 4090.28s]  Only one stamina loss.
[4090.28s -> 4091.80s]  I need one more blip.
[4092.52s -> 4092.92s]  I got to...
[4092.92s -> 4093.16s]  Okay.
[4093.16s -> 4094.12s]  I got to get some yards here.
[4094.12s -> 4096.52s]  I want someone to knock that jackhole out of the game.
[4097.56s -> 4097.88s]  Perry.
[4097.88s -> 4098.44s]  We're going with this.
[4098.44s -> 4099.40s]  I'm going to go run and play.
[4099.40s -> 4099.96s]  I have to...
[4100.76s -> 4101.72s]  I have to get a good hit here.
[4105.24s -> 4105.72s]  Ow.
[4105.72s -> 4106.44s]  Oh, damn.
[4107.48s -> 4108.36s]  Timeout.
[4108.36s -> 4119.05s]  I'm going to go with the guy on the left.
[4120.62s -> 4125.90s]  I got it.
[4127.59s -> 4130.07s]  I have to get like an end zone pass right now.
[4130.07s -> 4130.95s]  We have to go for it.
[4133.24s -> 4134.28s]  Ah.
[4134.28s -> 4137.67s]  Triple nines.
[4147.19s -> 4148.71s]  Oh my god.
[4150.79s -> 4157.88s]  I did it.
[4157.88s -> 4158.20s]  All right.
[4158.20s -> 4159.08s]  Just kick a field goal.
[4159.64s -> 4161.08s]  I don't know how to kick a field goal though.
[4161.08s -> 4162.44s]  Just a field goal.
[4162.44s -> 4163.08s]  How do you do it?
[4163.80s -> 4170.81s]  Okay.
[4170.81s -> 4171.69s]  You just have to tap it.
[4173.38s -> 4173.70s]  On top.
[4173.70s -> 4174.34s]  Who gets the ball?
[4182.55s -> 4183.11s]  It's good.
[4183.67s -> 4183.91s]  All right.
[4183.91s -> 4188.76s]  That was a good kick.
[4189.32s -> 4190.68s]  I got a full meter, by the way.
[4190.68s -> 4192.36s]  I'm not going to use it until I need to.
[4199.11s -> 4199.83s]  Thank you.
[4199.83s -> 4210.97s]  Yeah, I can sprint with R2 instead of using the meter, right?
[4211.61s -> 4211.85s]  All right.
[4211.85s -> 4212.73s]  We're going to stay balanced.
[4213.61s -> 4215.45s]  The offense looking at first and 30.
[4215.45s -> 4215.69s]  I want...
[4215.69s -> 4216.97s]  Should I try to break through his neck?
[4216.97s -> 4217.37s]  I wonder.
[4219.61s -> 4227.30s]  No hurt.
[4227.30s -> 4228.02s]  He didn't get hurt.
[4228.02s -> 4228.98s]  Ah.
[4228.98s -> 4231.08s]  I thought I was going to hurt him.
[4231.80s -> 4236.95s]  I was trying to like break his body.
[4240.39s -> 4243.90s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[4245.50s -> 4245.98s]  Hello?
[4252.06s -> 4252.30s]  All right.
[4252.30s -> 4252.78s]  Anticipate.
[4252.78s -> 4253.42s]  I'm going to stay back.
[4256.94s -> 4261.14s]  I don't think so, buddy.
[4261.86s -> 4263.54s]  I'm going to pull this bullshit on me.
[4267.42s -> 4267.82s]  Fourth down.
[4267.82s -> 4268.86s]  What are you going to do?
[4268.86s -> 4273.24s]  Let's do prevention.
[4273.96s -> 4274.76s]  Just prevent.
[4276.46s -> 4276.70s]  No.
[4277.42s -> 4278.22s]  Just balance it up.
[4279.26s -> 4279.74s]  Lockdown.
[4280.89s -> 4281.05s]  They...
[4281.05s -> 4281.69s]  Oh, they can't...
[4281.69s -> 4282.73s]  They're punting it.
[4282.73s -> 4284.57s]  He's actually punting it in this game.
[4285.21s -> 4286.89s]  You go for it every time in this game.
[4286.89s -> 4287.61s]  What are you doing?
[4288.49s -> 4289.59s]  It's fake.
[4290.15s -> 4291.43s]  It's not fake.
[4293.64s -> 4294.60s]  Oh, god damn it.
[4295.16s -> 4300.12s]  It's all right.
[4306.90s -> 4307.62s]  Is that good?
[4308.18s -> 4308.98s]  That's a good question.
[4309.54s -> 4309.78s]  All right.
[4309.78s -> 4310.26s]  I got to get...
[4310.26s -> 4311.22s]  I have to get a parry here.
[4311.94s -> 4312.74s]  I have to.
[4312.74s -> 4315.94s]  I didn't think that that would work, but I just did it.
[4321.69s -> 4323.05s]  Franchise.
[4323.05s -> 4323.53s]  Corner look.
[4333.53s -> 4334.33s]  You can taunt.
[4335.61s -> 4336.41s]  No, no, no, no.
[4341.13s -> 4344.15s]  Oh, I got some...
[4344.15s -> 4345.35s]  I got two points there.
[4354.55s -> 4355.35s]  Right there.
[4355.35s -> 4356.15s]  Two points there.
[4356.15s -> 4356.47s]  Got it.
[4357.43s -> 4358.39s]  Now, they need to score.
[4358.39s -> 4359.43s]  13, 14...
[4359.43s -> 4360.15s]  They get a score.
[4360.15s -> 4361.43s]  So I can get my money.
[4361.43s -> 4361.67s]  Right?
[4362.63s -> 4369.59s]  That's all right.
[4369.59s -> 4371.66s]  I'm gonna fucking hurt somebody.
[4372.54s -> 4376.71s]  I tried.
[4377.43s -> 4378.47s]  I tried to hurt somebody.
[4380.02s -> 4380.66s]  Am I actually...
[4380.66s -> 4381.22s]  So I just...
[4381.22s -> 4382.26s]  I have to be more than five.
[4383.06s -> 4390.92s]  I love the incomprehensible fake John Madden.
[4390.92s -> 4391.16s]  Yeah.
[4392.20s -> 4395.67s]  Three hits.
[4395.67s -> 4396.15s]  Yeah.
[4401.67s -> 4402.39s]  Uh...
[4402.39s -> 4403.59s]  How about zone?
[4404.87s -> 4405.83s]  I don't know what any of these mean.
[4406.63s -> 4408.10s]  I'm not gonna lie.
[4408.10s -> 4409.22s]  I don't know a thing about this.
[4409.22s -> 4412.26s]  All I know is that you punch people and you can suplex them on their back.
[4412.26s -> 4412.90s]  And they break their neck.
[4414.66s -> 4415.96s]  But wait for it.
[4415.96s -> 4416.60s]  Man, that's ugly.
[4416.60s -> 4418.76s]  I mean, you got your pretty and then you got your...
[4418.76s -> 4420.36s]  Can't get a date to the prom ugly.
[4420.36s -> 4421.24s]  And that's what that was.
[4421.24s -> 4422.44s]  But hey, what do you think about it?
[4422.44s -> 4424.68s]  I'm not the best looking corsage on lapel.
[4424.68s -> 4425.40s]  So in a way...
[4425.40s -> 4425.96s]  Yeah, think about it.
[4425.96s -> 4426.84s]  It's kind of beautiful.
[4426.84s -> 4427.80s]  Hard class.
[4427.80s -> 4430.20s]  It's the kind of ugly only a mother could find beautiful.
[4430.20s -> 4430.92s]  Oh, that's it.
[4430.92s -> 4432.12s]  Does that make sense?
[4432.12s -> 4433.00s]  What the hell is he saying?
[4433.00s -> 4434.28s]  As we reach the end of the third quarter,
[4434.28s -> 4436.12s]  Las Vegas leads by 10.
[4436.52s -> 4437.16s]  How was that?
[4437.16s -> 4439.64s]  How's the Super Bowl going?
[4440.60s -> 4442.39s]  Patriots have the ball.
[4442.39s -> 4443.35s]  Still three nothing.
[4444.39s -> 4447.70s]  Not the same bullshit.
[4448.58s -> 4457.88s]  Somebody get him!
[4459.08s -> 4460.84s]  First down yardage right there.
[4460.84s -> 4461.40s]  Give me a break.
[4461.40s -> 4462.20s]  How did nobody get him?
[4465.08s -> 4465.64s]  Super Bowl.
[4473.78s -> 4474.34s]  Nope.
[4474.34s -> 4479.86s]  Defender made sure there was no receiver there to make the catch.
[4482.10s -> 4482.98s]  Let's go with the lockdown.
[4484.95s -> 4487.98s]  Spongebob is singing the Doom OST.
[4491.38s -> 4491.86s]  Oh!
[4496.68s -> 4496.92s]  Oh!
[4497.96s -> 4509.58s]  I got a full meter.
[4509.58s -> 4510.22s]  I'm going for it.
[4510.22s -> 4511.26s]  I'm going for the kill shot here.
[4513.48s -> 4514.36s]  I gotta get that ball.
[4515.24s -> 4517.29s]  We're going with the...
[4517.29s -> 4519.37s]  We're going with the fucking total blitz here.
[4519.93s -> 4520.57s]  I...
[4520.57s -> 4520.97s]  Someone's...
[4520.97s -> 4521.61s]  I gotta go for it.
[4525.35s -> 4529.32s]  It's all right.
[4538.36s -> 4548.31s]  Still ahead.
[4548.31s -> 4549.35s]  I need to get another touchdown.
[4549.99s -> 4553.21s]  Are they gonna kick on sides?
[4553.21s -> 4553.61s]  They might.
[4554.49s -> 4554.89s]  Are they?
[4555.69s -> 4563.66s]  Oh, no.
[4563.66s -> 4564.06s]  That's my...
[4564.06s -> 4564.46s]  I...
[4577.93s -> 4578.33s]  Okay.
[4579.13s -> 4579.37s]  So...
[4580.49s -> 4581.13s]  Fuck this.
[4581.13s -> 4582.49s]  Hail Mary all the way down.
[4582.49s -> 4584.65s]  And I'm gonna do an unleash catch and catch it.
[4587.37s -> 4596.86s]  Why would you turn around?
[4602.62s -> 4603.02s]  Balance.
[4603.02s -> 4603.66s]  We're gonna do...
[4603.66s -> 4604.14s]  Okay.
[4604.14s -> 4605.02s]  I need to get a good...
[4606.31s -> 4607.59s]  I'm not gonna unleash this yet.
[4607.59s -> 4608.55s]  Let's throw the clock out.
[4612.04s -> 4618.95s]  All right.
[4618.95s -> 4619.91s]  That's the first down.
[4619.91s -> 4620.79s]  They're doing a timeout.
[4623.03s -> 4623.59s]  I'm gonna run again.
[4623.59s -> 4623.67s]  I'm gonna run again.
[4623.67s -> 4624.95s]  It would probably make people sick.
[4624.95s -> 4625.51s]  Especially me.
[4625.51s -> 4626.71s]  But I still wish I could do it.
[4627.35s -> 4628.55s]  Red zone offense here.
[4631.64s -> 4635.96s]  We gotta say about that.
[4636.52s -> 4637.00s]  See you later.
[4642.95s -> 4643.35s]  Oh!
[4643.35s -> 4644.63s]  What the hell are you talking about?
[4645.19s -> 4646.07s]  They don't have a meter either.
[4646.07s -> 4646.47s]  It's over.
[4651.91s -> 4652.47s]  Zero meter.
[4653.19s -> 4662.82s]  That's my game today.
[4662.82s -> 4663.06s]  Yeah!
[4663.70s -> 4665.16s]  Just kick it off normally.
[4665.16s -> 4666.60s]  I just don't really feel comfortable in my pants.
[4666.60s -> 4667.72s]  I don't know what it is.
[4667.72s -> 4668.84s]  I know I'm supposed to wear them.
[4668.84s -> 4669.96s]  I'm expected to wear them.
[4670.68s -> 4672.60s]  Something keeps telling me not to trust them.
[4672.60s -> 4675.16s]  See if I can get an injury here.
[4677.16s -> 4678.28s]  That was fucking pretty good.
[4678.28s -> 4678.84s]  But didn't...
[4678.84s -> 4679.48s]  I didn't injure him.
[4679.48s -> 4680.44s]  Just took his stamina down.
[4681.40s -> 4686.12s]  Who the hell is this?
[4686.12s -> 4687.56s]  It's supposed to be John Madden.
[4687.56s -> 4688.60s]  But not John Madden.
[4688.60s -> 4689.72s]  It's like fake John Madden.
[4690.44s -> 4696.90s]  I have to injure somebody.
[4701.93s -> 4702.73s]  Why did you fall down?
[4706.78s -> 4707.82s]  Break us back in half!
[4710.73s -> 4711.23s]  Yeah!
[4713.43s -> 4714.63s]  Why am I excited about that?
[4721.19s -> 4722.55s]  Break us back in half!
[4723.66s -> 4724.30s]  It's the game.
[4724.30s -> 4725.66s]  It's the video game doing it to me.
[4727.26s -> 4730.06s]  Now we're just going for something more dire than that.
[4731.42s -> 4739.02s]  Jerma wants blood.
[4739.90s -> 4743.86s]  I'm gonna get it.
[4744.66s -> 4745.78s]  You'll see it.
[4745.78s -> 4747.14s]  I'm gonna tear somebody's leg off.
[4748.34s -> 4751.91s]  I can't do nothing.
[4755.21s -> 4755.93s]  Let's do balance.
[4757.53s -> 4758.09s]  Coming back in.
[4763.78s -> 4764.10s]  All right.
[4764.10s -> 4766.10s]  I got one more opportunity to really hurt somebody.
[4768.30s -> 4770.12s]  Get a pass.
[4774.70s -> 4775.74s]  That would have been it probably.
[4781.14s -> 4781.94s]  This is the last attempt.
[4786.26s -> 4786.90s]  Oh, that's it.
[4787.46s -> 4787.86s]  That's it.
[4789.30s -> 4789.78s]  Game over.
[4791.14s -> 4792.02s]  I'll take my money too.
[4794.50s -> 4795.86s]  Can I still hurt somebody you think?
[4797.14s -> 4797.94s]  Let's try to hurt somebody.
[4798.74s -> 4803.54s]  Come here.
[4809.54s -> 4810.02s]  Come on!
[4810.02s -> 4810.98s]  You can do it!
[4810.98s -> 4812.66s]  You can do another touchdown.
[4812.66s -> 4813.16s]  Taunt!
[4820.22s -> 4822.30s]  So Las Vegas wins the game.
[4823.34s -> 4824.70s]  37 to 1.
[4824.70s -> 4825.20s]  I'll take it.
[4828.33s -> 4829.29s]  Beat Philadelphia.
[4829.29s -> 4830.17s]  Passing yards.
[4830.17s -> 4830.81s]  Rushing yards.
[4830.81s -> 4831.69s]  Return yards.
[4831.69s -> 4832.09s]  Sacks.
[4832.09s -> 4832.49s]  Fumbles.
[4832.49s -> 4832.99s]  Recovered.
[4837.50s -> 4839.02s]  22 times 2.
[4839.02s -> 4839.34s]  Okay.
[4839.34s -> 4839.90s]  5k.
[4839.90s -> 4840.78s]  Unleash dirty hits.
[4841.98s -> 4842.78s]  That's how you make money.
[4845.13s -> 4845.61s]  Wager.
[4845.61s -> 4846.11s]  Winner.
[4847.88s -> 4849.48s]  $207,000.
[4852.47s -> 4855.37s]  You've unlocked concept art.
[4856.17s -> 4856.73s]  Movies.
[4857.69s -> 4858.73s]  Jackpot trophy.
[4859.37s -> 4862.06s]  This game's very fun.
[4862.06s -> 4865.24s]  What's your trophy level now?
[4865.24s -> 4865.96s]  I have no idea.
[4870.07s -> 4870.97s]  Phone.
[4870.97s -> 4872.41s]  We're off to a good start.
[4872.41s -> 4874.97s]  Keep it up and you'll be drawing all the right kinds of attention.
[4874.97s -> 4876.41s]  I'm talking sponsors, of course.
[4876.41s -> 4880.33s]  The better you play, the more sponsors will come looking for your endorsement.
[4880.33s -> 4883.45s]  And that means some sweet new equipment for you and your team.
[4883.45s -> 4884.33s]  Jerma agent.
[4886.39s -> 4887.27s]  Oh, it's Kim.
[4887.27s -> 4888.07s]  Kim, what's up?
[4888.07s -> 4889.11s]  Hi franchise.
[4889.11s -> 4889.75s]  This is Kim.
[4890.39s -> 4893.59s]  I'm acting on behalf of your agent to explore your marketing potential.
[4894.15s -> 4896.95s]  You are already generating major interest.
[4896.95s -> 4899.43s]  If you can put in a strong performance this Sunday,
[4899.99s -> 4902.31s]  I can work my magic with the sponsors.
[4902.31s -> 4902.63s]  Okay.
[4902.63s -> 4905.43s]  Franchise must gain over 200 combined yards.
[4907.78s -> 4908.10s]  Okay.
[4909.78s -> 4910.42s]  Wow.
[4910.42s -> 4911.78s]  What a game.
[4911.78s -> 4913.46s]  How many yards did you rack up?
[4913.46s -> 4914.90s]  Hell, I stopped counting.
[4914.90s -> 4915.46s]  But whatever.
[4915.46s -> 4917.99s]  As it gave our new sponsor a major hard-on.
[4917.99s -> 4920.07s]  They couldn't wait to sign on the dotted line.
[4921.66s -> 4924.38s]  You're awarded the protector helmet by value tech.
[4925.10s -> 4932.95s]  Sponsor's protector is plus two to resist injury.
[4933.75s -> 4935.11s]  The name on the helmet says it all.
[4935.11s -> 4936.87s]  It isn't the most comfortable headgear in the world,
[4936.87s -> 4940.31s]  but it will certainly protect your players from wide variety of injuries
[4940.31s -> 4941.51s]  that other helmets would not.
[4942.31s -> 4944.28s]  All right, nice.
[4946.14s -> 4946.62s]  Is it on?
[4946.62s -> 4947.82s]  It's just on, right?
[4947.82s -> 4948.22s]  Yeah.
[4948.22s -> 4950.18s]  Okay.
[4950.18s -> 4952.34s]  So I want, let's see here.
[4952.34s -> 4953.14s]  I got money, right?
[4953.94s -> 4959.35s]  Let's see.
[4959.35s -> 4963.77s]  It's 125,000 for the first level.
[4965.14s -> 4967.30s]  I need some better speed.
[4967.30s -> 4967.94s]  I think so.
[4969.18s -> 4970.14s]  Put ankle weights on.
[4970.14s -> 4972.06s]  Provides a little extra resistance in training sessions
[4972.06s -> 4974.38s]  to really strengthen those quad and calf muscles.
[4977.26s -> 4977.98s]  Tackling.
[4977.98s -> 4979.98s]  This will keep all the offensive players healthy
[4979.98s -> 4982.86s]  and practice and allow defenders to unleash on some helpless pads.
[4988.62s -> 4989.10s]  Tackle.
[4989.10s -> 4996.28s]  And this is why I'm not parrying well.
[4996.28s -> 4999.88s]  Because it's break tackle.
[4999.88s -> 5001.80s]  It was so low.
[5003.29s -> 5003.77s]  That's why.
[5004.41s -> 5006.71s]  I think there was only like 11 points.
[5009.66s -> 5010.38s]  Breaking tackles.
[5010.38s -> 5011.18s]  I can't do them.
[5011.18s -> 5012.30s]  I need to, I have to put this on.
[5013.18s -> 5018.49s]  That's all right, but no.
[5018.49s -> 5019.13s]  Who's injured?
[5021.45s -> 5023.69s]  Each staff subtracts one week.
[5023.69s -> 5024.65s]  Broken collarbone.
[5026.04s -> 5026.36s]  Okay.
[5027.74s -> 5029.34s]  So he's out for one game.
[5031.29s -> 5032.49s]  Upgrade facilities.
[5032.49s -> 5035.37s]  Purchase adds two additional staff of 15 grand.
[5035.37s -> 5036.17s]  Yeah, just do it.
[5036.17s -> 5036.73s]  One as well.
[5037.37s -> 5040.23s]  All right.
[5040.23s -> 5041.75s]  Now who should illegally juice?
[5045.10s -> 5045.82s]  Offense.
[5045.82s -> 5046.86s]  I'm going to juice this week.
[5048.68s -> 5049.24s]  Choose drop.
[5050.68s -> 5052.60s]  Reduce the stamina loss from tackles by 25%.
[5053.48s -> 5055.32s]  It's one of the cheapest over-the-counter drugs in the market,
[5055.32s -> 5057.64s]  but it's very effective in keeping the body healthy for a long haul.
[5059.16s -> 5060.04s]  Trilafine.
[5060.04s -> 5062.04s]  Decreases class drains by 25%.
[5065.38s -> 5066.74s]  I just spit all over myself.
[5067.54s -> 5070.18s]  Everyone's so like sad about this.
[5070.90s -> 5072.50s]  Just taking a shitload of drugs.
[5072.50s -> 5075.30s]  Increases the stamina loss to opponents by 50%.
[5077.72s -> 5080.84s]  Speed up, speeds up the heart rate and delivers enormous amounts of energy.
[5082.90s -> 5085.06s]  Turbo bar drains 50% slower.
[5085.78s -> 5088.18s]  Reduces the chance and severity of injuries.
[5089.86s -> 5099.77s]  Regenerate two stamina each play they're on the field.
[5100.41s -> 5101.77s]  Reduce stamina loss from tackles.
[5101.77s -> 5103.21s]  Let's do, I like this one.
[5104.41s -> 5106.17s]  Increases the stamina loss to opponents.
[5107.05s -> 5110.81s]  We're not going to go too crazy here.
[5115.14s -> 5118.42s]  The team, team risk is, I don't want to get it any higher than that.
[5120.41s -> 5121.21s]  Mr. Super Bowl.
[5124.98s -> 5125.94s]  Go crazy.
[5125.94s -> 5127.62s]  No, no, why would I do that?
[5130.70s -> 5131.42s]  All right.
[5131.42s -> 5134.82s]  So I have to get a lot of yards here, right?
[5139.22s -> 5139.86s]  Max bet.
[5140.18s -> 5140.74s]  No, I don't know.
[5140.74s -> 5142.10s]  Let's do a $5,000 bet.
[5142.10s -> 5142.82s]  I'm not going to be crazy.
[5143.78s -> 5144.90s]  Minus 16.
[5146.41s -> 5149.29s]  Las Vegas must win by more than 16 points.
[5149.29s -> 5150.89s]  No, that's not going to happen.
[5150.89s -> 5151.53s]  That's a lot.
[5152.25s -> 5153.53s]  I'll give $1,000 to it.
[5154.97s -> 5156.33s]  They're a better team anyways.
[5159.21s -> 5161.45s]  Their stats are just overall better than mine.
[5161.45s -> 5164.66s]  So I got to play good here.
[5165.99s -> 5167.75s]  You're taking this game seriously.
[5169.99s -> 5170.79s]  It's really fun.
[5175.91s -> 5180.47s]  He's a warrior and the spearhead of the Bearcat offense.
[5181.43s -> 5183.03s]  There's only one man to fear.
[5183.03s -> 5185.99s]  So defend the spirit attack by aiming for him.
[5185.99s -> 5186.31s]  Okay.
[5186.95s -> 5190.95s]  Pazzi's taken a lot of pounding, but he's still as sharp and lethal as ever.
[5192.79s -> 5193.27s]  Baltimore.
[5194.47s -> 5197.77s]  Watch the offense.
[5202.89s -> 5205.05s]  Still three nothing Patriots in the Super Bowl.
[5206.39s -> 5207.51s]  Welcome to the Super Bowl party.
[5208.98s -> 5210.02s]  There's no party.
[5210.02s -> 5213.80s]  It's just me and NFL, not NFL.
[5214.44s -> 5215.64s]  It's just blitz the league too.
[5216.36s -> 5219.16s]  We'll be having a party time.
[5221.66s -> 5222.70s]  Get extra money.
[5225.50s -> 5227.83s]  I get extra money for injuring.
[5227.83s -> 5229.03s]  Oh my God.
[5229.03s -> 5229.75s]  Those are ugly.
[5235.72s -> 5236.84s]  That's an eyesore.
[5241.43s -> 5242.47s]  He didn't even catch it.
[5244.09s -> 5244.81s]  Bench that guy.
[5251.56s -> 5254.44s]  Do I need to get the yards or how does it work?
[5259.40s -> 5260.44s]  Oh, that was two though.
[5260.44s -> 5261.32s]  That was two stiff arms.
[5261.32s -> 5262.12s]  Good thing I trained it.
[5262.84s -> 5266.20s]  They're not gonna do the same play again.
[5266.20s -> 5267.40s]  They're not even gonna fucking see it coming.
[5269.96s -> 5288.87s]  Are you kidding me?
[5292.28s -> 5293.48s]  How is that possible?
[5294.76s -> 5296.87s]  This is the guy.
[5296.87s -> 5297.59s]  That's the guy.
[5299.29s -> 5301.45s]  Nice tackle and beat the shit out of him too.
[5301.45s -> 5301.93s]  This is the guy.
[5303.93s -> 5305.99s]  Oh, he fought me off.
[5306.79s -> 5312.95s]  That's the guy though.
[5313.91s -> 5315.03s]  I got a, I got a power.
[5315.03s -> 5315.91s]  I'm going for it.
[5316.63s -> 5318.26s]  It's going to go.
[5318.26s -> 5319.38s]  We're going to go anticipate.
[5319.38s -> 5320.82s]  I'm going to, I'm going to injure this dude.
[5321.70s -> 5323.62s]  I'm going right for his legs.
[5324.90s -> 5330.46s]  He's done.
[5330.46s -> 5330.78s]  Got him.
[5337.19s -> 5342.06s]  You're out of here.
[5342.06s -> 5343.82s]  Out for 10 games.
[5345.53s -> 5346.17s]  10 games.
[5346.17s -> 5346.57s]  He's gone.
[5348.22s -> 5349.10s]  Ruptured Spleen.
[5353.05s -> 5353.61s]  That was the guy.
[5353.61s -> 5354.73s]  That was the intro cinematic.
[5362.68s -> 5363.80s]  Just ruined his career.
[5363.80s -> 5366.02s]  Well, that's up.
[5366.02s -> 5367.54s]  Oh, they're punting it.
[5367.54s -> 5368.04s]  Shit.
[5368.82s -> 5371.40s]  Why would you punt from here?
[5372.12s -> 5373.08s]  You don't have that far to go.
[5384.89s -> 5385.29s]  Okay.
[5385.29s -> 5386.57s]  So we got the ball again.
[5387.45s -> 5390.15s]  We're going to go with a empty.
[5391.35s -> 5393.74s]  They cross over the field.
[5393.74s -> 5395.34s]  We're going to try to catch them and cross over.
[5395.34s -> 5397.02s]  Ball at the 17 yard line.
[5400.04s -> 5400.54s]  There.
[5405.48s -> 5405.88s]  Got it.
[5405.88s -> 5407.40s]  Las Vegas with a nice game there.
[5407.40s -> 5408.44s]  Oh, I didn't get the first down.
[5410.94s -> 5411.58s]  I can run that.
[5411.58s -> 5412.06s]  Let's just go.
[5415.94s -> 5416.44s]  For some.
[5416.98s -> 5418.98s]  No, boat left.
[5418.98s -> 5419.94s]  I had to step over.
[5420.50s -> 5424.25s]  Oh, damn.
[5424.25s -> 5424.73s]  Okay.
[5424.73s -> 5426.01s]  He really took a shot.
[5426.01s -> 5426.65s]  Okay, fine.
[5427.37s -> 5427.87s]  Whatever.
[5431.00s -> 5432.44s]  I'm just going to be going for it again.
[5434.68s -> 5442.02s]  Take it.
[5442.02s -> 5444.34s]  That was some exhibition of raw running ability.
[5444.34s -> 5445.78s]  You can't teach that kind of talent.
[5447.22s -> 5447.38s]  All right.
[5447.38s -> 5448.26s]  Let's go with balance.
[5448.26s -> 5449.46s]  I'm going to pass play.
[5450.58s -> 5451.14s]  Brash out.
[5451.14s -> 5451.94s]  We're going for the guy on the right.
[5456.44s -> 5464.02s]  Wait, fourth down.
[5464.02s -> 5465.62s]  And so at the end of one quarter of play.
[5465.62s -> 5466.34s]  Didn't I get a first down?
[5466.34s -> 5466.98s]  We're scoreless.
[5467.94s -> 5472.52s]  No, that wasn't a first down.
[5473.16s -> 5473.80s]  What can we do?
[5474.52s -> 5475.32s]  We got to boot it.
[5476.20s -> 5484.89s]  Open.
[5484.89s -> 5485.21s]  Hold on.
[5485.21s -> 5485.69s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[5486.81s -> 5490.52s]  To the right side.
[5490.52s -> 5491.24s]  Got it.
[5491.24s -> 5492.04s]  That's a first down.
[5492.04s -> 5494.12s]  Stopped at the 21 yard line.
[5494.12s -> 5494.52s]  Hold on.
[5494.52s -> 5494.92s]  Wait, wait.
[5494.92s -> 5495.40s]  Open the link.
[5495.40s -> 5495.96s]  What are you doing?
[5495.96s -> 5496.68s]  What is happening?
[5503.43s -> 5504.23s]  Oh, my God.
[5507.42s -> 5507.82s]  That is.
[5511.30s -> 5512.50s]  Okay, cool.
[5512.50s -> 5513.06s]  That's good.
[5513.86s -> 5514.90s]  I'll do it the other way.
[5514.90s -> 5517.22s]  I want to see it from both sides.
[5517.22s -> 5519.14s]  I want the bottom to be me and the top to be him.
[5519.78s -> 5521.21s]  That's wonderful though.
[5524.82s -> 5525.54s]  Do it the other way.
[5525.54s -> 5526.98s]  First down yardage right there.
[5526.98s -> 5527.30s]  The offense is looking good.
[5527.30s -> 5528.42s]  I got a first down.
[5528.42s -> 5529.06s]  They're driving.
[5530.95s -> 5531.67s]  I'm going for.
[5536.30s -> 5537.50s]  I like this one.
[5537.50s -> 5537.98s]  This fade.
[5540.50s -> 5540.90s]  Touchdown.
[5540.90s -> 5541.22s]  Here we go.
[5541.94s -> 5543.46s]  And I should have full meter for the next.
[5544.74s -> 5545.67s]  We can go ready.
[5545.67s -> 5545.91s]  Watch.
[5545.91s -> 5546.39s]  Watch X.
[5546.39s -> 5546.87s]  Watch X.
[5547.99s -> 5551.43s]  That's a beautiful catch.
[5551.99s -> 5555.98s]  I'm going to play it safe.
[5555.98s -> 5556.62s]  I'm just going to kick it.
[5557.26s -> 5564.90s]  Just get the.
[5564.90s -> 5566.26s]  The extra point is good.
[5570.36s -> 5571.48s]  Just regular kickoff.
[5571.48s -> 5572.28s]  No messy stuff.
[5577.27s -> 5578.55s]  Now let's try to hurt someone.
[5579.78s -> 5581.06s]  First chance I get right here.
[5585.96s -> 5596.28s]  Oh, that's 13.
[5596.28s -> 5598.28s]  Just give me another one for free.
[5598.28s -> 5600.76s]  You ever had that acid reflux, you know, with the heart burden,
[5600.76s -> 5602.68s]  and then, you know, with the rest of it, all that kind of stuff.
[5604.12s -> 5607.94s]  14 nothing.
[5607.94s -> 5608.98s]  And the extra point is good.
[5610.02s -> 5613.45s]  Hey, another thing we just did.
[5613.45s -> 5614.01s]  Let's do it again.
[5615.05s -> 5619.93s]  Do I have full meter?
[5619.93s -> 5621.85s]  I don't have full meter, but I can still hurt somebody.
[5622.65s -> 5625.80s]  There it is.
[5626.52s -> 5627.00s]  All right.
[5627.00s -> 5627.64s]  Stomp on his head.
[5629.72s -> 5633.05s]  I got meter again.
[5633.05s -> 5633.53s]  Let's go for it.
[5635.70s -> 5638.66s]  They are actual garbage without their crutch player.
[5638.66s -> 5642.06s]  Yeah, we're going to get the ball back again.
[5643.93s -> 5645.13s]  First down, 30 yards.
[5645.13s -> 5645.53s]  Really good thing.
[5645.53s -> 5646.09s]  I took him up.
[5646.89s -> 5648.47s]  See if I can get the ball back.
[5649.35s -> 5656.12s]  What just happened?
[5658.87s -> 5663.99s]  Oh, there it is.
[5663.99s -> 5664.39s]  There it is.
[5664.39s -> 5668.02s]  Hold on.
[5668.02s -> 5668.42s]  New one.
[5673.11s -> 5673.75s]  Jesus.
[5675.43s -> 5680.66s]  Oh, what is that?
[5680.66s -> 5683.86s]  Oh, this is a ready player one avatar.
[5683.86s -> 5684.58s]  I don't like this.
[5693.19s -> 5695.27s]  That's me going in the Oasis and hanging out.
[5699.82s -> 5700.22s]  All right.
[5700.22s -> 5702.78s]  Uh, show us.
[5703.42s -> 5703.98s]  Hold on.
[5703.98s -> 5704.38s]  I need to.
[5704.94s -> 5707.24s]  Yeah, this is worth saving.
[5707.24s -> 5711.72s]  This is what I'm talking about.
[5711.72s -> 5716.07s]  And I'm going to take a piss break, by the way, while you stare at this image.
[5716.63s -> 5722.46s]  This is what I'm talking about when I say my ready player one avatar.
[5723.10s -> 5724.79s]  How the hell did you even do this?
[5725.35s -> 5726.97s]  All right, I'll be right back.
[5747.75s -> 5748.71s]  All right, hold on.
[5748.71s -> 5749.03s]  Hold on.
[5749.03s -> 5751.43s]  Before I go, you know what this reminds me of?
[5751.43s -> 5752.39s]  This looks like.
[5753.72s -> 5755.88s]  This looks like this is supposed to be here.
[5755.88s -> 5758.57s]  Do you know what I mean by that?
[5758.57s -> 5760.66s]  How this is like what?
[5760.66s -> 5761.86s]  German 985 stream.
[5761.86s -> 5762.82s]  I'll be right back.
[5763.46s -> 5767.62s]  It's like a cartoon kind of 3D version of me, like a YouTuber kind of thing.
[5767.62s -> 5775.93s]  This looks like it's I'm supposed to have this here.
[5775.93s -> 5925.30s]  All right, I hate this image.
[5926.82s -> 5937.46s]  What am I looking at?
[5937.46s -> 5943.72s]  Oh, no, let me like do like, let me deep dive this.
[5943.72s -> 5944.12s]  Hold on.
[5947.06s -> 5948.26s]  How did you even make this?
[5948.90s -> 5957.80s]  That's so weird and scary that this is possible.
[5969.10s -> 5970.78s]  Welcome back to the show.
[5970.78s -> 5972.14s]  It's German 985.
[5974.34s -> 5984.07s]  Oops, hold on.
[5984.07s -> 5985.03s]  Welcome back.
[5985.03s -> 5986.15s]  It's me, German.
[5986.15s -> 5987.19s]  Welcome back to the show.
[5987.75s -> 6014.57s]  How do I get this off?
[6020.82s -> 6022.10s]  His teeth aren't showing.
[6022.92s -> 6024.04s]  Side by side.
[6024.04s -> 6024.52s]  No, I.
[6025.32s -> 6026.12s]  Oh, don't limit it.
[6026.12s -> 6027.40s]  Don't just crush me.
[6027.40s -> 6031.58s]  That's so loud.
[6031.58s -> 6038.74s]  Oh, I look at OBS and I crack a tab and it blows out the audio every time.
[6038.74s -> 6042.78s]  It's a Coke.
[6042.78s -> 6044.14s]  I'm going to prove it.
[6044.14s -> 6045.02s]  There, proved it.
[6048.44s -> 6049.80s]  Now, hopefully the game didn't crash.
[6049.80s -> 6050.52s]  Me trying to prove it.
[6050.52s -> 6052.20s]  All right, so I got to beat by more than,
[6052.20s -> 6053.72s]  I got to win by more than 16 points.
[6053.72s -> 6055.48s]  Should have bet fucking max bet on this.
[6058.20s -> 6059.24s]  I'm going to get it.
[6059.24s -> 6062.31s]  Can we test the sync here, by the way?
[6062.31s -> 6064.23s]  One, two, three, four.
[6064.23s -> 6065.19s]  One, two, three.
[6066.01s -> 6068.97s]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[6068.97s -> 6069.45s]  We good?
[6074.90s -> 6076.18s]  All right, I get the ball, right?
[6076.98s -> 6077.86s]  How the Patriots do it?
[6078.50s -> 6080.89s]  Oh, fuck, it's tied up.
[6081.61s -> 6084.01s]  It's tie game.
[6084.73s -> 6085.21s]  Three to three.
[6085.21s -> 6085.93s]  They got a field goal.
[6087.21s -> 6091.03s]  What in the name of fucking God just happened?
[6095.06s -> 6096.58s]  They just Donkey Kong barreled.
[6097.46s -> 6098.26s]  They with the barrels.
[6099.38s -> 6100.58s]  The ball was Donkey Kong.
[6101.14s -> 6106.36s]  Offense with a long way to go here on third down.
[6109.77s -> 6113.98s]  Take his helmet off.
[6113.98s -> 6118.09s]  All right, this is fourth down.
[6118.09s -> 6118.73s]  Are they going to punt it?
[6118.73s -> 6120.57s]  15 yards to go.
[6120.57s -> 6122.15s]  Hold on.
[6122.15s -> 6122.95s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[6122.95s -> 6123.99s]  They're going to punt, aren't they?
[6123.99s -> 6124.87s]  Punt return.
[6124.87s -> 6125.67s]  Yeah, they are.
[6133.82s -> 6135.14s]  I don't have any meter though.
[6135.78s -> 6137.06s]  He didn't even catch that.
[6137.06s -> 6138.02s]  It just bounced in his hands.
[6139.06s -> 6141.62s]  Sheds a tackle and he's brought down.
[6141.62s -> 6143.14s]  I got something for shedding that tackle, didn't I?
[6145.13s -> 6145.69s]  Another one.
[6145.69s -> 6146.09s]  Hold on.
[6146.09s -> 6146.81s]  What is this one?
[6150.38s -> 6151.42s]  These are all so...
[6152.30s -> 6156.33s]  I just looked at the other one.
[6157.29s -> 6159.29s]  This one is also as detailed.
[6159.77s -> 6161.53s]  And there are more.
[6165.61s -> 6166.17s]  Okay, guys.
[6168.22s -> 6171.02s]  It's getting to a point where people, when they search me,
[6171.58s -> 6173.10s]  they're not going to know what the real one is.
[6173.74s -> 6179.48s]  Let's just put them all up on the screen eventually here.
[6179.48s -> 6181.16s]  Let me just like, let me get to the end of this.
[6185.78s -> 6186.10s]  I got it.
[6186.10s -> 6187.30s]  Okay, that's scaring me.
[6187.30s -> 6188.58s]  I need to close that.
[6188.58s -> 6190.26s]  End of the third quarter in the Super Bowl, by the way.
[6191.06s -> 6195.93s]  All right, let's go.
[6195.93s -> 6197.13s]  Let's do a pass play.
[6197.13s -> 6197.85s]  Big cross here.
[6199.72s -> 6201.56s]  I have 200 images of your face.
[6202.52s -> 6203.72s]  No one should have that many faces.
[6207.29s -> 6207.79s]  Got it.
[6210.78s -> 6219.20s]  Yes.
[6221.98s -> 6223.02s]  And that's a full meter.
[6225.46s -> 6228.90s]  Without their, without that player there, they are absolutely worthless.
[6229.62s -> 6230.18s]  That's it.
[6230.18s -> 6230.42s]  Fuck it.
[6230.42s -> 6231.30s]  We're just going to run it.
[6231.30s -> 6232.10s]  I got a full meter.
[6232.74s -> 6233.86s]  We're going to do an HP crush.
[6237.56s -> 6244.28s]  The version is good.
[6244.28s -> 6245.08s]  Speaking of full meter.
[6245.88s -> 6246.52s]  Got it back.
[6246.52s -> 6250.36s]  And so at halftime, Las Vegas leads by 22.
[6250.36s -> 6251.88s]  It's a good thing that you killed that guy.
[6256.98s -> 6258.82s]  Jerma actually knows that he's...
[6258.82s -> 6260.58s]  Jerma actually sounds like he knows what he's talking about.
[6262.01s -> 6263.61s]  I know some sports stuff.
[6263.61s -> 6264.11s]  Some.
[6264.65s -> 6265.15s]  Oops.
[6267.75s -> 6268.87s]  I know that this first one.
[6269.43s -> 6271.00s]  You know, I know what that is.
[6272.89s -> 6273.69s]  Crank his fucking neck.
[6274.81s -> 6275.31s]  Really?
[6275.93s -> 6277.64s]  That's too bad.
[6278.44s -> 6280.01s]  Is it 85% though?
[6285.26s -> 6290.30s]  I don't really follow football that well considering, if you think about it.
[6290.30s -> 6291.26s]  First and 30.
[6291.26s -> 6294.54s]  The New England Patriots are in the Super Bowl right now.
[6295.58s -> 6298.70s]  And I have a browser tab open just seeing how the score is.
[6306.62s -> 6309.02s]  So, I mean, I'm not that much of a big fan.
[6309.02s -> 6310.22s]  Of the sport.
[6310.22s -> 6311.90s]  I do think it's interesting sometimes.
[6312.94s -> 6315.18s]  Baltimore leads by 22.
[6315.98s -> 6317.34s]  Let's see if I can make something happen here.
[6318.78s -> 6319.82s]  I got a long way to go.
[6326.36s -> 6327.08s]  Cheerleaders.
[6328.52s -> 6330.92s]  They really are doing just that kind of the dumbest dances.
[6332.55s -> 6334.23s]  To me, this is mocap.
[6335.46s -> 6335.96s]  Okay.
[6336.82s -> 6346.74s]  That was a fumble.
[6350.07s -> 6351.75s]  This is a big fourth down coming up.
[6354.41s -> 6355.13s]  Are they going to punt it?
[6355.13s -> 6356.49s]  You need to shut them down.
[6356.49s -> 6357.21s]  They had to punt it.
[6365.58s -> 6368.20s]  Am I going to shut this team up?
[6369.16s -> 6370.44s]  Again, I didn't even catch it.
[6371.32s -> 6373.45s]  Holy fuck.
[6374.89s -> 6378.28s]  I ran out of gas.
[6378.28s -> 6378.78s]  It's okay.
[6380.97s -> 6382.17s]  Let's go with...
[6382.17s -> 6382.49s]  Let's do it.
[6382.49s -> 6384.89s]  Let's do our own Donkey Kong barrel play.
[6384.89s -> 6385.45s]  Bring it back.
[6399.67s -> 6401.42s]  I gotta be careful.
[6402.86s -> 6403.34s]  Don't run it.
[6403.34s -> 6403.98s]  I gotta pass it.
[6406.81s -> 6408.33s]  I could get a fumble here or somebody get hurt.
[6413.19s -> 6413.69s]  Oh.
[6415.35s -> 6417.50s]  Okay.
[6418.36s -> 6418.92s]  Trick play.
[6420.36s -> 6421.32s]  Break delay.
[6421.32s -> 6421.82s]  No.
[6422.28s -> 6422.92s]  Snowflake.
[6423.56s -> 6424.06s]  Maniac.
[6424.60s -> 6425.72s]  They just go all over the place.
[6429.85s -> 6432.98s]  How's this for a maniac?
[6432.98s -> 6433.48s]  Wide open.
[6434.18s -> 6435.50s]  Just land.
[6435.50s -> 6436.14s]  Land, land.
[6436.14s -> 6437.02s]  I'm not getting unleashed.
[6438.70s -> 6441.34s]  If you don't know, if he uses Unleashed,
[6442.86s -> 6447.34s]  there's a high chance that he'll break my neck or will fumble.
[6448.06s -> 6449.34s]  So I need to just down myself.
[6453.34s -> 6453.74s]  No!
[6453.74s -> 6454.54s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[6456.31s -> 6456.87s]  I survived.
[6470.81s -> 6472.97s]  The rambling boomer is the best part of the game.
[6474.39s -> 6475.59s]  Everything is a boomer.
[6477.85s -> 6479.21s]  Everything is a boomer.
[6479.21s -> 6482.57s]  All adults over the age of like 30 are boomers.
[6489.94s -> 6490.50s]  God damn it.
[6490.50s -> 6491.46s]  And it's a touchback.
[6491.46s -> 6491.96s]  Shit.
[6498.82s -> 6500.18s]  A boomer in the background.
[6508.17s -> 6508.73s]  Get it back!
[6509.61s -> 6509.93s]  No!
[6509.93s -> 6510.43s]  Shit!
[6511.69s -> 6528.14s]  That was so abrupt.
[6530.76s -> 6531.64s]  Oh, man.
[6540.92s -> 6542.20s]  He just bounced off the ropes.
[6542.20s -> 6542.60s]  And I just...
[6545.72s -> 6547.32s]  Why won't they make another one of these?
[6548.82s -> 6549.38s]  Seriously.
[6549.38s -> 6551.54s]  I don't even give a shit about football, really.
[6552.50s -> 6553.06s]  Oh, God.
[6553.06s -> 6554.10s]  I would play this all day.
[6556.54s -> 6557.75s]  Fourth down still.
[6558.47s -> 6562.57s]  Are they gonna punt?
[6562.57s -> 6563.21s]  You can't punt.
[6563.21s -> 6564.01s]  You have to go for it.
[6565.61s -> 6566.41s]  Fourth and long.
[6566.41s -> 6568.01s]  They really need a big play here.
[6570.28s -> 6571.24s]  Come back, come back, come back.
[6577.62s -> 6578.18s]  All right.
[6578.18s -> 6579.14s]  Let's go for a shutout.
[6583.06s -> 6587.94s]  He doesn't have any meter or anything.
[6591.98s -> 6593.10s]  That's just getting embarrassing.
[6593.10s -> 6594.30s]  That's embarrassing.
[6599.74s -> 6604.10s]  There's a new image.
[6607.80s -> 6609.88s]  What the hell is going on?
[6613.16s -> 6614.04s]  Wait, just wait, wait.
[6614.04s -> 6614.84s]  I need to put that on.
[6619.02s -> 6620.70s]  I'll get a conversion here.
[6626.49s -> 6634.95s]  Let's add an insult to injury here.
[6635.75s -> 6638.62s]  Yeah, should have made that bet, right?
[6640.44s -> 6641.32s]  I'll try to injure him.
[6643.08s -> 6645.00s]  No, I wanted that tackle.
[6645.00s -> 6645.32s]  Not you.
[6649.11s -> 6649.43s]  Shutout.
[6649.43s -> 6650.55s]  Give me the achievement for the shutout.
[6658.94s -> 6659.58s]  That's a fumble.
[6662.54s -> 6664.62s]  I just like spinning wheelhouse kicked him.
[6669.82s -> 6672.38s]  Can I do a 40-point shutout or 38-point shutout?
[6678.42s -> 6679.46s]  Oh, my God.
[6693.59s -> 6694.39s]  I got it.
[6694.39s -> 6695.03s]  Across the clean.
[6695.91s -> 6698.66s]  Let's go for a...
[6699.94s -> 6703.21s]  I'm going to try to get the guy in the middle right.
[6703.21s -> 6703.93s]  He's going to turn around.
[6708.34s -> 6710.18s]  That square is going to turn around right now.
[6710.74s -> 6712.02s]  You dickhead game.
[6712.02s -> 6713.86s]  No, I'm not going to 36 points.
[6727.21s -> 6728.17s]  Pain, pain, pain.
[6728.73s -> 6729.29s]  Make him hurt.
[6730.49s -> 6730.97s]  Light hit.
[6730.97s -> 6731.37s]  Get it.
[6731.37s -> 6732.01s]  Step on his head.
[6732.97s -> 6738.81s]  Now I can actually do an injury here.
[6740.41s -> 6740.97s]  New link.
[6744.30s -> 6745.50s]  It's going by too fast.
[6748.41s -> 6749.37s]  Oh, my God.
[6751.90s -> 6753.74s]  The offense looking at first and 30.
[6753.74s -> 6754.46s]  What the fuck are these?
[6776.20s -> 6777.88s]  97% accuracy.
[6777.88s -> 6778.20s]  Really?
[6779.00s -> 6780.73s]  I have another one.
[6781.37s -> 6784.30s]  I want to go for the quarterback, though.
[6785.02s -> 6785.98s]  I don't even care about the play.
[6785.98s -> 6786.94s]  I want to hurt the quarterback.
[6801.67s -> 6802.63s]  He's not injured, though.
[6802.63s -> 6804.87s]  The quarterback is the paint.
[6804.87s -> 6806.71s]  And the paint was all over the canvas.
[6806.71s -> 6809.03s]  I mean, it's like the paint all over the entire paint canvas.
[6811.03s -> 6813.91s]  And the receiver gets taken out before the ball gets near him.
[6813.91s -> 6815.43s]  I don't think he knows what hit him.
[6815.43s -> 6816.63s]  Let's stop him right here, right here.
[6816.63s -> 6817.59s]  Let's do it again.
[6817.59s -> 6818.39s]  Oh, he's coming back in.
[6818.39s -> 6819.51s]  It's all right.
[6819.51s -> 6820.07s]  Good?
[6820.07s -> 6820.55s]  You good to go?
[6821.11s -> 6821.59s]  Go get him.
[6822.90s -> 6823.86s]  Is the announcer drunk?
[6823.86s -> 6826.58s]  No, the announcer is doing a John Madden impersonation.
[6827.46s -> 6830.74s]  John Madden was unknown at...
[6831.22s -> 6831.46s]  side.
[6832.42s -> 6833.22s]  Okay.
[6833.22s -> 6833.54s]  Okay.
[6837.70s -> 6838.26s]  I can't.
[6838.26s -> 6838.74s]  Damn it.
[6838.74s -> 6839.86s]  No fucking shut up.
[6840.74s -> 6856.22s]  Give me the penalty.
[6856.22s -> 6856.70s]  I don't even care.
[6856.70s -> 6857.50s]  I'm fucking hurting someone.
[6858.54s -> 6859.42s]  I can't go across.
[6866.18s -> 6867.54s]  They're doing an onside kick, aren't they?
[6868.70s -> 6869.50s]  Nothing matters.
[6870.06s -> 6872.95s]  It doesn't matter anyway.
[6879.50s -> 6880.86s]  Yeah, it's Frank Caliendo.
[6881.50s -> 6882.78s]  He was on Mad TV.
[6884.44s -> 6885.80s]  First down and 30.
[6885.80s -> 6890.20s]  And he did a perfect one-to-one John Madden impression.
[6890.68s -> 6891.72s]  It was pretty ridiculous.
[6892.76s -> 6893.96s]  What was that pass?
[6894.76s -> 6895.72s]  What did...
[6895.72s -> 6896.84s]  Is there a replay feature?
[6900.26s -> 6901.54s]  What the hell was this?
[6907.96s -> 6908.84s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[6908.84s -> 6928.04s]  Go back.
[6928.04s -> 6930.92s]  I underhanded that ball like 45 yards.
[6930.92s -> 6931.48s]  50 yards.
[6933.08s -> 6933.58s]  Okay.
[6934.92s -> 6936.12s]  Bowling ball that...
[6936.12s -> 6937.24s]  What are we doing for?
[6937.24s -> 6938.04s]  How about manning?
[6938.04s -> 6938.44s]  No.
[6938.44s -> 6939.16s]  Razzle go.
[6946.33s -> 6946.97s]  Into the end zone.
[6948.65s -> 6950.49s]  It's all right.
[6950.49s -> 6950.99s]  Game over.
[6954.38s -> 6955.18s]  Should have bet the money.
[6956.14s -> 6962.70s]  It's the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl tied at three.
[6967.35s -> 6968.31s]  That's going to be a lot of money.
[6970.09s -> 6971.78s]  Turnovers caused touchdowns.
[6972.50s -> 6974.66s]  Wager $1,000 to $256,000.
[6976.58s -> 6977.46s]  That's pretty damn good.
[6988.84s -> 6989.40s]  New link.
[6997.13s -> 6998.97s]  During the cutscene, I'm going to get these saved.
[6998.97s -> 6999.85s]  We'll put them on screen.
[7001.13s -> 7004.31s]  Have a seat.
[7005.11s -> 7008.20s]  Just have a seat.
[7008.20s -> 7008.92s]  What's this about?
[7009.56s -> 7017.06s]  You're going to go play with that new hotshot, Franchise.
[7017.06s -> 7019.54s]  Why the fuck would I want to play there?
[7019.54s -> 7021.14s]  His team's in division three.
[7021.86s -> 7025.70s]  Because I happen to know that the nightmare is going to cut you at the end of this season.
[7025.70s -> 7026.58s]  Let's put them up here.
[7026.58s -> 7028.66s]  Along with that big contract of yours.
[7029.30s -> 7032.10s]  That's why they traded up to draft Max Carson.
[7032.90s -> 7034.26s]  Oh man, fuck them.
[7036.07s -> 7041.03s]  You might get picked up by another team for a fraction of your current salary.
[7042.15s -> 7044.31s]  Or you can go play with Franchise.
[7045.35s -> 7047.43s]  They keep your deal as is.
[7053.43s -> 7054.79s]  Just tell me one thing.
[7055.51s -> 7056.55s]  What's in it for you?
[7072.97s -> 7074.17s]  There's too many of these.
[7081.88s -> 7083.56s]  There are too many of them.
[7083.56s -> 7087.30s]  Okay, I swear to God.
[7087.30s -> 7088.02s]  I'm not kidding.
[7088.02s -> 7088.34s]  I don't know.
[7088.34s -> 7089.62s]  Call me like a weirdo if you want.
[7090.26s -> 7094.90s]  But I feel like I look in the mirror and this is what I look like sometimes.
[7096.49s -> 7104.87s]  I'll take a selfie with an iPhone and this is what the image will be.
[7104.87s -> 7105.91s]  I swear.
[7116.60s -> 7117.32s]  All right, it's Kim.
[7118.26s -> 7123.46s]  Wow, what a football.
[7123.46s -> 7126.26s]  You and I need to get together this evening and discuss our options.
[7126.26s -> 7127.62s]  It's the front-facing camera.
[7127.62s -> 7130.18s]  You'll find me a flexible negotiator.
[7131.14s -> 7131.77s]  Okay.
[7132.78s -> 7134.54s]  You and I need to get together this evening.
[7135.26s -> 7137.02s]  It's time to go on a date.
[7137.74s -> 7138.66s]  Apparently.
[7140.63s -> 7143.67s]  Darling, you dressed to kill.
[7143.67s -> 7145.99s]  Have time to talk a little business?
[7145.99s -> 7147.51s]  Whatever you like, beautiful.
[7148.47s -> 7152.95s]  We have the opportunity to land the biggest sporting goods company in North America.
[7152.95s -> 7155.35s]  And you need me to do a little meet and greet.
[7155.91s -> 7158.15s]  Their reps will be at the game this Sunday.
[7158.15s -> 7161.99s]  I need you to give me a top-notch performance.
[7161.99s -> 7163.91s]  That's the only kind I ever give.
[7164.63s -> 7166.71s]  Get it done on the field, hotshot.
[7166.71s -> 7169.35s]  And perhaps we can celebrate afterwards.
[7170.63s -> 7178.46s]  That one's not even.
[7179.61s -> 7181.05s]  This one is not even.
[7182.98s -> 7186.26s]  You didn't even try to change it to the other photo.
[7187.98s -> 7189.50s]  You just mutated my face.
[7197.08s -> 7198.28s]  Okay, this one is the agent.
[7198.84s -> 7200.44s]  This one's the agent too.
[7200.44s -> 7201.24s]  You're getting a little weird.
[7204.17s -> 7216.82s]  And this one is just slowly turning into a gnome.
[7216.82s -> 7217.62s]  All right, roster.
[7218.26s -> 7220.70s]  I think there's some changes here.
[7221.26s -> 7223.72s]  I got a new player, right?
[7223.72s -> 7232.95s]  All right, I got offense, quarterback.
[7232.95s -> 7233.83s]  I'm a C plus.
[7235.26s -> 7236.46s]  Defense, defense.
[7236.46s -> 7238.54s]  Anybody like, do I have any Ds?
[7238.54s -> 7239.34s]  All right, I don't know.
[7239.34s -> 7240.78s]  You might have, you guys might have to go here.
[7243.03s -> 7243.59s]  D plus.
[7244.31s -> 7255.32s]  They're all Cs and Ds.
[7256.73s -> 7257.77s]  Lifestyle.
[7257.77s -> 7258.65s]  Sponsors again.
[7259.91s -> 7260.63s]  Protector.
[7260.63s -> 7262.39s]  Crunch pads plus two tackle.
[7263.27s -> 7265.75s]  Crunch pads help defenders pack a little extra punch in their hits.
[7266.71s -> 7266.95s]  Cool.
[7269.27s -> 7270.39s]  Oh, let's see.
[7270.39s -> 7270.87s]  Trainer.
[7271.59s -> 7271.99s]  Training.
[7273.40s -> 7275.08s]  Assign the training automatically.
[7275.08s -> 7275.64s]  Upgrades.
[7277.56s -> 7278.68s]  More tackle.
[7278.68s -> 7279.72s]  255 grand.
[7283.14s -> 7283.62s]  Yep.
[7283.62s -> 7284.90s]  I want to be unstoppable.
[7284.90s -> 7285.70s]  What is going on?
[7319.46s -> 7327.69s]  Okay, I'm standing looking into a pond in a dramatic part of the movie,
[7328.79s -> 7332.71s]  and somebody dropped a pebble right in the middle of my face in the water.
[7333.27s -> 7345.58s]  That's fucking ridiculous.
[7345.58s -> 7346.62s]  All right, tackle.
[7346.62s -> 7347.26s]  Two tackle.
[7348.31s -> 7350.23s]  I need some, okay, better hands.
[7351.03s -> 7352.74s]  No, I don't have enough money.
[7352.74s -> 7353.94s]  Do I have enough money for anything else?
[7356.92s -> 7357.80s]  Ice bath.
[7357.80s -> 7358.84s]  Get rid of all the swelling.
[7358.84s -> 7360.52s]  You still have to be careful of shrinkage.
[7360.52s -> 7362.63s]  Oh, that's funny.
[7367.48s -> 7368.84s]  I've seen the fireman.
[7370.60s -> 7372.36s]  Oh, we got old boomer hands.
[7373.16s -> 7375.06s]  No, I'm gonna hold the money.
[7375.06s -> 7376.18s]  Let's take some more drugs.
[7378.97s -> 7383.21s]  For me, I like this turbo bar drain.
[7383.21s -> 7383.61s]  Slower.
[7383.61s -> 7385.21s]  Reduce the chance of severity of injuries.
[7386.09s -> 7391.77s]  Game plus two stamina for every successful clash or unleash move.
[7392.71s -> 7393.03s]  Yeah.
[7397.11s -> 7402.36s]  And let's have the halfback.
[7402.36s -> 7408.23s]  Clash drains for the halfback.
[7408.23s -> 7409.03s]  Yeah, I think so.
[7409.03s -> 7410.47s]  All right, easy with the drug risk.
[7414.78s -> 7417.26s]  I gotta do halfback plays here.
[7420.30s -> 7421.58s]  All right, any, what's this one?
[7422.14s -> 7427.00s]  I just got gnomed.
[7429.02s -> 7431.02s]  Well, there are a million images in the,
[7432.06s -> 7440.78s]  but that's what happens when people are just putting in links.
[7441.34s -> 7442.06s]  All right, let's go.
[7444.10s -> 7446.50s]  Las Vegas must win by more than 17 points.
[7446.50s -> 7448.10s]  I need better stats than this.
[7448.98s -> 7449.70s]  Train already.
[7455.91s -> 7456.95s]  Fourth quarter.
[7456.95s -> 7458.07s]  What a boring Super Bowl.
[7458.07s -> 7459.67s]  Oh, Patriots scored.
[7459.67s -> 7462.70s]  I was gonna say what a boring Super Bowl.
[7462.70s -> 7464.06s]  Three to three for the whole game.
[7466.82s -> 7467.86s]  Patriots up 10-3.
[7468.82s -> 7470.26s]  Seven minutes remaining in the last quarter.
[7470.82s -> 7475.78s]  I mean, Tom Bladey really is just so unbelievable.
[7477.50s -> 7478.06s]  5,000.
[7482.33s -> 7485.21s]  The Houston rioters have been the Division 3 punching bag
[7485.21s -> 7487.13s]  since they joined the league three years ago.
[7488.81s -> 7491.40s]  That might be changing this year
[7491.40s -> 7493.64s]  since they drafted running back Don L. Sullivan
[7493.64s -> 7494.44s]  in the first round.
[7494.44s -> 7494.92s]  Running back.
[7495.72s -> 7496.20s]  That's the target.
[7496.20s -> 7498.12s]  The guy's got an effective one-two punch.
[7498.12s -> 7501.00s]  His wicked first to speed followed by his stiff arm jab.
[7501.64s -> 7503.56s]  And he ain't afraid to hit below the belt.
[7504.12s -> 7505.96s]  So if we want to shut down Houston,
[7505.96s -> 7507.64s]  we need to knock out Sullivan.
[7511.26s -> 7512.62s]  Time to kill this guy.
[7519.42s -> 7520.62s]  Who is this in real life?
[7521.42s -> 7522.38s]  It's all fictional.
[7523.61s -> 7524.09s]  No, people.
[7524.09s -> 7526.89s]  There are no real people in the game, I don't believe.
[7527.93s -> 7530.01s]  This is not a licensed NFL video game.
[7532.86s -> 7534.38s]  Pro, they got a strong running game.
[7535.43s -> 7536.79s]  But their con is their speed.
[7536.79s -> 7537.67s]  How does that make any sense?
[7538.55s -> 7541.11s]  How can you have a slow, strong running team?
[7541.11s -> 7542.07s]  Good evening, everyone.
[7553.21s -> 7554.17s]  It begins.
[7554.17s -> 7559.80s]  It's a dirty hit right off the bat.
[7559.80s -> 7561.16s]  And I can, let's go.
[7561.16s -> 7562.04s]  What's the name of the drink?
[7564.34s -> 7569.75s]  All right, I got two blips so far.
[7570.71s -> 7571.51s]  Good breath back.
[7573.03s -> 7574.55s]  So we're going to stop the running game.
[7577.64s -> 7584.38s]  First down and 30.
[7584.38s -> 7587.21s]  Stop him.
[7587.21s -> 7587.77s]  Stop him.
[7588.73s -> 7589.53s]  Oh, that's him.
[7589.53s -> 7590.97s]  Any other questions this guy's leadership
[7590.97s -> 7592.73s]  may can just look to a play like that.
[7593.53s -> 7598.82s]  All right, I got to take him out.
[7600.92s -> 7603.98s]  I'm going to say crush.
[7606.97s -> 7607.61s]  There he is.
[7607.61s -> 7608.17s]  I see you.
[7610.90s -> 7615.08s]  You see that?
[7615.64s -> 7616.20s]  That was me.
[7616.20s -> 7617.56s]  That's called me waiting for you.
[7618.20s -> 7620.89s]  And now I got a meter.
[7625.61s -> 7626.01s]  Same deal.
[7626.01s -> 7626.89s]  You want to go for the same guy?
[7627.69s -> 7629.13s]  Go for it.
[7629.69s -> 7634.98s]  Oh, I had an opportunity.
[7635.70s -> 7637.06s]  He didn't make it through though.
[7637.06s -> 7638.63s]  Let's forward down.
[7638.63s -> 7639.27s]  They're going to punt it.
[7645.13s -> 7646.17s]  Where are the refs?
[7648.62s -> 7649.74s]  Yeah, where are the refs?
[7652.34s -> 7653.54s]  Why would you do that?
[7653.54s -> 7656.90s]  I have punt return and oh, God.
[7662.38s -> 7663.42s]  Keeps his feet moving.
[7664.06s -> 7671.30s]  You guys are fucking kidding me.
[7671.30s -> 7671.62s]  All right.
[7671.62s -> 7672.34s]  Now we taunt.
[7678.34s -> 7680.18s]  Dream of as a special teams player.
[7680.18s -> 7681.30s]  That was really, really good.
[7681.30s -> 7682.42s]  Went right during that return.
[7683.46s -> 7686.66s]  A punt punt returned from the end zone
[7686.66s -> 7690.26s]  that the guy didn't catch to run back for a touchdown.
[7691.77s -> 7692.49s]  Welcome to hell.
[7695.70s -> 7700.80s]  Catch it.
[7703.74s -> 7704.24s]  I got it.
[7707.78s -> 7708.26s]  I got it.
[7708.26s -> 7708.98s]  I actually got it.
[7709.62s -> 7725.86s]  I still have a full meter to new image.
[7730.07s -> 7731.19s]  Watch the guy in the bottom right.
[7731.19s -> 7731.69s]  Twenty eight.
[7733.03s -> 7733.75s]  That's the captain.
[7739.34s -> 7741.10s]  I am not going to select anybody else
[7741.10s -> 7742.46s]  because if he gets through it's a touchdown.
[7742.46s -> 7743.26s]  So I'm staying back.
[7744.38s -> 7746.86s]  Is it actually cursed image in chat right now?
[7746.86s -> 7747.18s]  I can't.
[7747.18s -> 7748.06s]  That's going to make the throw up.
[7748.06s -> 7748.78s]  I can't look at that.
[7748.78s -> 7750.38s]  I actually just hurt my head looking at that.
[7753.18s -> 7754.14s]  That's all I see now.
[7754.70s -> 7755.58s]  I don't see anything else.
[7763.32s -> 7763.88s]  Third down.
[7765.06s -> 7765.78s]  Let's do the flip.
[7766.34s -> 7767.96s]  Twenty eight right there.
[7767.96s -> 7768.84s]  They're going to twenty eight.
[7768.84s -> 7769.56s]  I'm going to crush him.
[7769.56s -> 7770.36s]  Ravity goes up the middle.
[7772.58s -> 7773.30s]  No.
[7773.30s -> 7773.94s]  Quarter ran out.
[7774.90s -> 7778.98s]  And that's the end of the first quarter as Las Vegas leads by eight.
[7778.98s -> 7779.30s]  Yeah.
[7779.30s -> 7780.18s]  Watch that picture.
[7782.02s -> 7782.90s]  Be easy on that picture.
[7782.90s -> 7785.38s]  If you have you're sensitive to light rays
[7785.38s -> 7787.06s]  and sensitive to wacky images.
[7788.34s -> 7789.46s]  I advise you not to click it
[7790.10s -> 7791.86s]  because I just got like a headache for five seconds.
[7794.25s -> 7800.94s]  Fourth down.
[7812.54s -> 7813.02s]  Same deal.
[7813.98s -> 7814.38s]  Oh fuck.
[7814.38s -> 7815.18s]  They're punting.
[7815.18s -> 7815.42s]  Shit.
[7815.42s -> 7816.06s]  Somebody catch it.
[7816.94s -> 7819.21s]  I always figure they're not going to do it.
[7824.62s -> 7827.43s]  All right.
[7827.43s -> 7828.39s]  There's an opportunity here.
[7831.11s -> 7832.63s]  Couldn't couldn't plow through it.
[7832.63s -> 7833.75s]  He's got better stats than I do.
[7839.94s -> 7840.50s]  Let's go.
[7841.62s -> 7842.79s]  Let's go straight up.
[7853.46s -> 7856.26s]  I might try to do a big no no no let's run it run it.
[7857.46s -> 7864.94s]  Crush.
[7865.58s -> 7866.62s]  Halfback crush.
[7866.62s -> 7867.58s]  I have the drug.
[7867.58s -> 7868.62s]  My halfback is on drugs.
[7873.30s -> 7875.62s]  Can't plow through that even with drugs.
[7875.62s -> 7876.26s]  That sucks.
[7876.98s -> 7877.86s]  Do it again.
[7877.86s -> 7879.70s]  I like their chances here on third and short.
[7883.35s -> 7883.75s]  Damn it.
[7883.75s -> 7886.63s]  I promise you he's gonna feel that one tomorrow.
[7886.63s -> 7887.75s]  Shit he actually got through.
[7893.43s -> 7893.75s]  Fuck it.
[7893.75s -> 7894.31s]  I'm going for it.
[7896.58s -> 7904.36s]  Franchise gives his team a new set of downs.
[7905.88s -> 7906.44s]  Fake punt.
[7906.44s -> 7907.40s]  No I'm just going right.
[7907.40s -> 7908.52s]  I just have to get the first down.
[7908.52s -> 7909.24s]  That's all I care about.
[7911.42s -> 7912.78s]  Now I have to be very careful.
[7913.58s -> 7915.00s]  I gotta get a touchdown right here.
[7918.95s -> 7919.99s]  He lets it fly.
[7922.28s -> 7923.80s]  The ball gets there too late.
[7923.80s -> 7925.64s]  Or should I say the defender got there.
[7925.64s -> 7927.24s]  Oh I just got clotheslined.
[7927.24s -> 7927.56s]  Shit.
[7934.10s -> 7935.54s]  Second I gotta get this now.
[7936.58s -> 7945.53s]  Houston comes up with the turnover.
[7945.53s -> 7947.85s]  Sorry here comes this is they got one play.
[7949.32s -> 7951.96s]  At least he blew his uh unleash.
[7953.00s -> 7954.10s]  They got one play.
[7955.08s -> 7956.36s]  I'm staying all the way back.
[7957.00s -> 7958.52s]  I ain't gonna let somebody just get across here.
[7962.60s -> 7965.78s]  The first half of the books.
[7965.78s -> 7967.94s]  Las Vegas leads by eight.
[7967.94s -> 7968.66s]  Four minutes.
[7969.78s -> 7971.94s]  In the Super Bowl Patriots up 10-3.
[7972.98s -> 7977.18s]  He's actually playing safety.
[7977.18s -> 7979.42s]  Yeah um yeah sometimes you have to play the game where you're supposed to.
[7980.14s -> 7985.96s]  These dirty hits.
[7996.02s -> 8001.54s]  First and 30.
[8003.38s -> 8004.58s]  Oh I can't look at that right.
[8005.22s -> 8005.46s]  Wait.
[8010.12s -> 8013.56s]  Hey hey hey Herbert thanks for the five community subs.
[8014.36s -> 8016.42s]  The links.
[8017.56s -> 8019.24s]  Thank you for the community subs Herbert.
[8023.82s -> 8025.42s]  Oh well there's too many people coming at me.
[8025.42s -> 8039.03s]  Got the first down.
[8042.73s -> 8043.85s]  All right we're kind of at the.
[8043.85s -> 8044.65s]  Let's do a goal line here.
[8044.65s -> 8045.29s]  First and goal.
[8045.29s -> 8047.13s]  This is not I mean it is goal.
[8049.51s -> 8051.51s]  Cut out to the left.
[8051.51s -> 8051.99s]  There it is.
[8051.99s -> 8052.47s]  There it is.
[8053.43s -> 8057.05s]  These guys are very the defense is very good.
[8057.05s -> 8057.85s]  It's hard to break through.
[8057.85s -> 8059.21s]  Second down down.
[8059.21s -> 8063.26s]  Hey uh what we got him at the team breakfast this morning.
[8070.94s -> 8071.50s]  Get in there.
[8072.86s -> 8073.50s]  I got an unleash.
[8073.50s -> 8076.06s]  Las Vegas gives themselves some more breathing room with that score.
[8077.98s -> 8081.82s]  No let's just be smart because they still have their star player.
[8086.22s -> 8089.14s]  The extra point is good.
[8090.97s -> 8092.97s]  First and 10 at New England 4.
[8100.02s -> 8101.30s]  I'm getting live updates here.
[8101.94s -> 8106.28s]  All right somebody just said.
[8107.56s -> 8107.88s]  Break.
[8107.88s -> 8108.36s]  Come on.
[8108.36s -> 8108.84s]  Injury.
[8112.20s -> 8112.70s]  Yeah.
[8118.98s -> 8121.46s]  Somebody just said who would ever move to Las Vegas.
[8121.46s -> 8122.82s]  It's a fucking wasteland.
[8132.38s -> 8136.22s]  Well hey Vegas is great.
[8136.22s -> 8136.86s]  What are you talking about.
[8137.58s -> 8143.21s]  That was another touchdown by the way.
[8143.85s -> 8145.93s]  Those are paying attention.
[8145.93s -> 8151.19s]  Nobody has made or anything.
[8151.19s -> 8154.78s]  So it's a couple of late hits.
[8154.78s -> 8155.42s]  Step on the helmet.
[8158.86s -> 8165.80s]  Why would you move to Vegas.
[8166.68s -> 8167.72s]  Why would you move anywhere.
[8170.44s -> 8172.50s]  Why did I just get that.
[8173.38s -> 8177.02s]  You can get a chance to move.
[8183.27s -> 8184.47s]  And you're angry.
[8184.47s -> 8185.67s]  He's they can tell I'm angry.
[8186.95s -> 8188.07s]  That back here it is.
[8191.35s -> 8191.67s]  Got it.
[8191.67s -> 8192.07s]  Thank God.
[8193.03s -> 8193.43s]  I don't know.
[8193.43s -> 8193.91s]  Thank God.
[8193.91s -> 8195.11s]  I don't know by law.
[8195.11s -> 8197.19s]  As we reach the end of the third quarter.
[8197.19s -> 8199.19s]  Las Vegas leads by 21.
[8201.16s -> 8201.72s]  That's this.
[8202.68s -> 8207.86s]  By the way t-shirts are available.
[8208.42s -> 8211.94s]  If you want a German 985 officially licensed t-shirt.
[8212.74s -> 8213.22s]  They are.
[8213.22s -> 8214.42s]  There's a new t-shirt store.
[8215.22s -> 8216.82s]  It's on taste frame.
[8216.82s -> 8219.38s]  Go ahead and if you want it is the night sky is now available.
[8219.38s -> 8231.22s]  And blue man is back.
[8231.22s -> 8232.98s]  Please include that image on a shirt.
[8233.94s -> 8235.88s]  That's no.
[8235.88s -> 8237.16s]  I don't want to put that on.
[8237.16s -> 8237.40s]  Why.
[8240.52s -> 8245.94s]  Stop him at the 29 yard line.
[8245.94s -> 8247.62s]  I hope you enjoyed your popcorn folks.
[8247.62s -> 8249.30s]  Because you just saw quite a show.
[8249.30s -> 8250.10s]  What a run.
[8250.10s -> 8250.66s]  Let's get here.
[8250.66s -> 8252.34s]  Crucial series of downs here.
[8252.34s -> 8254.26s]  Ball spotted the 29 yard line.
[8258.90s -> 8259.94s]  Holy shit.
[8259.94s -> 8260.98s]  They're going to get a touchdown.
[8260.98s -> 8262.10s]  That was wild.
[8267.22s -> 8278.68s]  I know.
[8278.68s -> 8279.56s]  I have to kill that guy.
[8279.56s -> 8280.60s]  But it's easier said than done.
[8281.40s -> 8286.52s]  I almost blocked it.
[8286.52s -> 8288.18s]  The extra point is good.
[8288.98s -> 8292.14s]  And he got.
[8293.02s -> 8295.42s]  And it looks like they'll try it on sidekick.
[8295.42s -> 8297.58s]  They got to get two more full possessions.
[8299.10s -> 8304.94s]  They're not going to get two full possessions.
[8304.94s -> 8305.58s]  In a minute.
[8307.30s -> 8308.74s]  Damn that was a hit.
[8309.46s -> 8311.46s]  I don't see any new kids in his future.
[8312.02s -> 8312.74s]  Oh what.
[8313.78s -> 8314.34s]  Flush inside.
[8314.34s -> 8314.98s]  I'm going to go for a run.
[8314.98s -> 8315.94s]  First down and 30.
[8319.02s -> 8321.02s]  Damn it.
[8322.30s -> 8324.63s]  Who was that?
[8328.68s -> 8329.00s]  Robbie.
[8341.53s -> 8343.05s]  No not Robbie.
[8343.05s -> 8344.17s]  Anybody but Robbie.
[8347.35s -> 8348.63s]  Listen this isn't working.
[8350.79s -> 8351.35s]  Let's go with.
[8351.35s -> 8351.91s]  What else have you got?
[8351.91s -> 8352.15s]  Let's go with mom.
[8352.15s -> 8353.99s]  Second down and about a mile.
[8353.99s -> 8354.79s]  They don't have any meter.
[8359.74s -> 8361.18s]  Looking for the big play.
[8361.18s -> 8361.66s]  Got it.
[8362.38s -> 8363.42s]  Oh there it is.
[8364.54s -> 8370.94s]  Now it's out of reach.
[8371.58s -> 8373.34s]  Pretty much completely.
[8373.98s -> 8375.70s]  Let's go with a little dog shit pass.
[8382.78s -> 8383.42s]  Right here.
[8383.42s -> 8383.82s]  Right here.
[8383.82s -> 8384.14s]  Right here.
[8384.14s -> 8384.54s]  Right here.
[8384.54s -> 8387.56s]  The conversion is good.
[8387.56s -> 8388.36s]  29.7.
[8392.65s -> 8393.37s]  What's the colors?
[8393.37s -> 8394.49s]  The colors are supposed to be.
[8395.37s -> 8399.34s]  The German 985 Twitch YouTuber colors.
[8400.92s -> 8403.58s]  They don't really look that good on.
[8406.18s -> 8408.18s]  They look like it's an ice cream cone.
[8408.18s -> 8408.82s]  But that's okay.
[8410.18s -> 8411.22s]  Right into my guy.
[8415.69s -> 8418.09s]  They don't look good on anything.
[8418.81s -> 8421.21s]  Well it looks good on a digital screen.
[8421.21s -> 8422.17s]  As like a character.
[8425.94s -> 8426.74s]  Oh god damn it.
[8428.25s -> 8429.85s]  Oh nice juke.
[8431.30s -> 8434.18s]  Houston exploits an opening in the defense for some real yardage.
[8434.18s -> 8435.86s]  All right this is my opportunity here.
[8435.86s -> 8438.18s]  It's time to crush.
[8438.18s -> 8438.90s]  First down.
[8438.90s -> 8439.38s]  30 yards to go.
[8439.38s -> 8440.50s]  I have an unleash.
[8440.50s -> 8442.10s]  I'm going to try to hurt somebody here.
[8442.10s -> 8442.74s]  Let's go.
[8442.74s -> 8444.26s]  They're going to go to the running back here.
[8447.22s -> 8450.65s]  You stopped my unleash.
[8451.77s -> 8453.29s]  How would you stop my unleash?
[8453.29s -> 8454.25s]  I was holding L2.
[8454.25s -> 8455.45s]  He stopped my unleash.
[8459.66s -> 8459.98s]  How?
[8460.62s -> 8461.34s]  He stopped it.
[8472.44s -> 8473.32s]  Don't matter.
[8473.32s -> 8476.04s]  It's legitimately impossible for them to get in this game.
[8476.86s -> 8477.58s]  It's impossible.
[8478.38s -> 8482.47s]  Stop my unleash.
[8482.47s -> 8484.06s]  You got to be kidding me.
[8484.06s -> 8486.14s]  We can try to.
[8488.26s -> 8488.98s]  There you go.
[8488.98s -> 8490.02s]  You're all right buddy.
[8490.02s -> 8491.22s]  All right Robbie get back in here.
[8494.46s -> 8499.18s]  Goes way down field.
[8499.18s -> 8501.42s]  And it's caught at the 15 yard line.
[8502.46s -> 8504.25s]  He turns on a dime.
[8505.05s -> 8505.85s]  Full line.
[8505.85s -> 8506.65s]  Touchdown.
[8506.65s -> 8507.69s]  Las Vegas.
[8507.69s -> 8508.89s]  Okay I'm trying to get a random code.
[8508.89s -> 8509.21s]  20.
[8510.09s -> 8513.19s]  Yeah Robbie comes in the game.
[8513.19s -> 8513.99s]  Let me see what happens.
[8513.99s -> 8515.03s]  Get out there and start.
[8525.82s -> 8526.46s]  It's no good.
[8527.66s -> 8528.54s]  It's okay.
[8529.18s -> 8539.35s]  It's 30 seconds in the game.
[8539.35s -> 8541.50s]  There's no way they're going to have this.
[8542.46s -> 8550.81s]  They might get one more touchdown.
[8550.81s -> 8551.13s]  Maybe.
[8551.93s -> 8553.53s]  They still get that guy in the game.
[8553.53s -> 8556.65s]  So I'm going to hang back.
[8557.37s -> 8567.61s]  Oh you got to hold on to that.
[8568.49s -> 8573.21s]  Quick kill someone before it ends.
[8573.21s -> 8574.81s]  I might not be able to.
[8574.81s -> 8587.30s]  Let's go for a chaos run.
[8599.82s -> 8600.94s]  Patriots win Super Bowl.
[8601.66s -> 8601.98s]  Did they?
[8603.02s -> 8605.38s]  Like there's still like a minute left right?
[8611.14s -> 8612.66s]  No he used his unleashed.
[8613.38s -> 8615.62s]  I'm gonna get it.
[8615.62s -> 8616.10s]  Game over.
[8616.98s -> 8620.34s]  And as time expires Las Vegas will take this one.
[8627.10s -> 8627.74s]  Beat Houston.
[8628.54s -> 8632.01s]  Two minute warning for the Super Bowl.
[8637.77s -> 8638.41s]  What a party.
[8641.00s -> 8642.36s]  No injuries unfortunately.
[8643.40s -> 8645.58s]  A lot of touchdowns.
[8645.58s -> 8648.52s]  They did get the wager right?
[8648.52s -> 8649.72s]  Because it was 17 points right?
[8650.92s -> 8653.29s]  Concept art.
[8653.93s -> 8658.23s]  Who am I rooting for in the Super Bowl?
[8659.83s -> 8664.06s]  I mean I'm from Massachusetts.
[8664.62s -> 8665.98s]  I lived there for 30 years.
[8666.62s -> 8670.28s]  So the Patriots probably.
[8671.08s -> 8672.87s]  If I were to have to sell you.
[8674.86s -> 8675.66s]  Is this?
[8675.66s -> 8676.46s]  Hey yourself.
[8677.26s -> 8685.98s]  Quick cut the stream.
[8686.54s -> 8689.14s]  How we doing on training?
[8689.86s -> 8690.34s]  Stats.
[8692.26s -> 8693.06s]  Power rankings.
[8693.06s -> 8693.86s]  League standings.
[8694.90s -> 8695.99s]  Girlfriends.
[8699.14s -> 8701.62s]  Kim provides exclusive sponsor equipment.
[8701.62s -> 8702.90s]  Marketing professional who specializes
[8702.90s -> 8704.02s]  in getting superstar athletes together
[8704.02s -> 8705.22s]  with top sports brands.
[8705.86s -> 8709.21s]  Did I get any new sponsors?
[8710.17s -> 8710.97s]  No new sponsors.
[8715.27s -> 8716.15s]  Training.
[8716.15s -> 8716.63s]  Upgrades.
[8720.26s -> 8720.90s]  I don't have enough.
[8722.06s -> 8722.94s]  What do I need?
[8723.90s -> 8724.78s]  I need better hands.
[8726.07s -> 8727.03s]  No more fumbles.
[8730.12s -> 8731.32s]  Or strength.
[8734.52s -> 8735.40s]  I'm going to say hands.
[8737.46s -> 8739.06s]  Hands and strength.
[8739.06s -> 8739.62s]  I got one.
[8740.18s -> 8740.82s]  Yeah I got enough.
[8743.83s -> 8745.51s]  It's just hand moisturizer.
[8746.55s -> 8747.43s]  Maybe speed too.
[8748.31s -> 8749.59s]  No I'll do strength.
[8754.81s -> 8755.69s]  All right.
[8755.69s -> 8757.13s]  Because my training is doing good.
[8759.66s -> 8760.78s]  Assigned training automatically.
[8766.26s -> 8767.46s]  So what do we got here?
[8767.46s -> 8768.82s]  I got two more games to advance.
[8769.62s -> 8770.66s]  Three and all right now.
[8770.66s -> 8772.66s]  Forty two thousand dollars in the bank.
[8773.62s -> 8780.95s]  And let's see where we're at now.
[8782.58s -> 8784.74s]  I have gained stats.
[8785.94s -> 8787.70s]  Our overall is two notches.
[8788.42s -> 8789.86s]  I went up in defense.
[8792.12s -> 8793.24s]  How do you spend a hundred grand
[8793.24s -> 8794.28s]  on hand moisturizer?
[8795.90s -> 8797.66s]  Win by more than 20 points.
[8798.54s -> 8802.47s]  I've done it two games in a row.
[8802.47s -> 8803.67s]  But that's a lot of money to bet.
[8804.23s -> 8804.73s]  Fuck it.
[8805.45s -> 8807.05s]  The Milwaukee Hounds used to be
[8807.05s -> 8808.81s]  a bunch of semi-pro misfits.
[8809.77s -> 8811.45s]  But quarterback Conrad Damon
[8811.45s -> 8813.13s]  has made them the high caliber team
[8813.13s -> 8814.65s]  to beat in division three.
[8814.65s -> 8816.17s]  Not bad for a guy who drives
[8816.17s -> 8817.69s]  a military assault vehicle.
[8817.69s -> 8818.89s]  He just ruined the whole field.
[8818.89s -> 8820.17s]  Conrad's got a cannon for an arm.
[8820.17s -> 8821.93s]  And a damn good receiver call.
[8822.57s -> 8823.93s]  Make no mistake.
[8823.93s -> 8825.93s]  This guy's a deadly bastard.
[8825.93s -> 8827.77s]  So hit him hard and hit him off.
[8829.13s -> 8829.85s]  All right.
[8829.85s -> 8830.25s]  Okay.
[8830.89s -> 8831.61s]  Easy there.
[8832.49s -> 8832.81s]  Guy.
[8834.73s -> 8835.05s]  What?
[8850.58s -> 8853.14s]  What is this shitty twisted metal reject?
[8856.22s -> 8857.02s]  We have to get rid of him.
[8857.02s -> 8858.30s]  Look at how long his body is.
[8859.30s -> 8861.22s]  He has an exceptionally long body.
[8863.13s -> 8864.17s]  Good evening, everyone.
[8869.43s -> 8870.39s]  So ugly.
[8870.39s -> 8870.87s]  Every time.
[8871.51s -> 8871.75s]  All right.
[8871.75s -> 8872.79s]  We got to go up to the quarterback.
[8877.93s -> 8878.57s]  That's the target.
[8883.29s -> 8884.57s]  And that's a fucking touchdown
[8884.57s -> 8885.37s]  right at the beginning of the game.
[8893.56s -> 8895.16s]  So nobody on their defense
[8895.16s -> 8896.60s]  is particularly terrifying.
[8898.36s -> 8899.69s]  Oh, almost.
[8899.69s -> 8900.19s]  Almost.
[8904.68s -> 8905.18s]  Oh!
[8907.32s -> 8908.12s]  That deserves a taunt.
[8908.12s -> 8909.00s]  That deserves a taunt.
[8909.80s -> 8910.44s]  How do I taunt?
[8918.38s -> 8919.58s]  That should have been a taunt.
[8924.46s -> 8925.26s]  No, I'm going to go safe.
[8927.08s -> 8928.04s]  Here we go.
[8928.04s -> 8934.82s]  Three extra points.
[8937.83s -> 8939.03s]  How's Super Bowl going?
[8939.03s -> 8939.75s]  One minute left.
[8939.75s -> 8940.47s]  Patriots have the ball.
[8940.47s -> 8942.55s]  4-1 at L.A. 24, really.
[8944.73s -> 8946.33s]  I don't know how up to date that is.
[8947.13s -> 8957.21s]  It is a nice dirty hit.
[8962.09s -> 8965.27s]  That was nice.
[8969.78s -> 8971.86s]  So they have an amazing quarterback.
[8973.19s -> 8974.15s]  So I got to be aware of that.
[8974.15s -> 8974.95s]  I got to try to injure him.
[8975.83s -> 8977.27s]  I don't want to do that for safety, though.
[8978.55s -> 8979.11s]  Maybe I do.
[8987.34s -> 8988.30s]  He's at 86%.
[8989.42s -> 8990.30s]  And I have an unleash.
[9002.89s -> 9004.25s]  Field goal for the Patriots.
[9004.25s -> 9004.75s]  Okay.
[9008.22s -> 9009.34s]  Caught that right at the very end.
[9010.70s -> 9012.62s]  So the Rams have one minute
[9013.98s -> 9014.48s]  to...
[9016.20s -> 9017.32s]  It's almost impossible, isn't it?
[9018.04s -> 9019.75s]  They're going to have to get a touchdown
[9020.79s -> 9022.23s]  and then an onside kick.
[9026.70s -> 9027.20s]  Damn.
[9027.58s -> 9029.18s]  Well, it's not impossible.
[9029.18s -> 9029.98s]  It's just improbable.
[9032.62s -> 9034.06s]  Ooh, nice interception.
[9034.94s -> 9039.58s]  See you later.
[9045.02s -> 9045.52s]  Identity.
[9051.05s -> 9054.81s]  Am I rooting for Rams?
[9054.81s -> 9056.97s]  I mean, I'm from New England.
[9058.01s -> 9059.13s]  The Patriots are the team
[9059.13s -> 9060.33s]  that I should be rooting for.
[9061.96s -> 9064.12s]  So I don't know.
[9064.12s -> 9069.21s]  Yeah, but right in the fucking head.
[9076.57s -> 9078.25s]  Cox chugged all the frames.
[9089.32s -> 9090.20s]  Oh, geez.
[9095.93s -> 9098.68s]  I don't know what that was.
[9098.68s -> 9099.24s]  What did I just hurt?
[9101.72s -> 9106.44s]  Broken rib.
[9106.44s -> 9107.24s]  You're up a two plays.
[9108.04s -> 9111.34s]  That's it.
[9111.34s -> 9114.54s]  See you in like two and a half minutes.
[9121.02s -> 9121.74s]  No game.
[9121.74s -> 9122.46s]  Only three yards.
[9128.30s -> 9129.42s]  I just broke a few ribs.
[9129.42s -> 9129.98s]  Just get in there.
[9139.35s -> 9139.85s]  Oh.
[9140.95s -> 9144.71s]  Not only is that illegal,
[9144.71s -> 9146.39s]  but that's how you find yourself in a jail cell.
[9147.27s -> 9152.26s]  Let's go back to balance.
[9152.26s -> 9153.06s]  He's going to be throwing it.
[9153.06s -> 9153.62s]  All right.
[9153.62s -> 9154.10s]  You're all right.
[9154.10s -> 9155.22s]  Let me see here.
[9155.22s -> 9155.70s]  Good.
[9155.70s -> 9156.74s]  You're good to go.
[9156.74s -> 9158.47s]  Go get him.
[9158.47s -> 9159.51s]  Actually illegal.
[9166.95s -> 9170.38s]  Oh, no.
[9170.38s -> 9171.34s]  He's still going.
[9171.34s -> 9172.22s]  I almost had it too.
[9173.10s -> 9173.58s]  He's close.
[9174.14s -> 9177.64s]  Crucial series of downs here.
[9178.94s -> 9179.58s]  Stuff him here.
[9182.20s -> 9191.96s]  Stuff him.
[9192.89s -> 9193.85s]  Don't give him a chance.
[9194.73s -> 9200.70s]  Ah, pick up one more.
[9200.70s -> 9201.98s]  That's the end of the first quarter
[9201.98s -> 9204.22s]  as Las Vegas leads by 15.
[9205.26s -> 9207.10s]  Tom Brady just grew an extra finger
[9207.10s -> 9209.42s]  to put on his sixth spring.
[9210.54s -> 9214.02s]  Is it actually over?
[9220.57s -> 9221.05s]  Damn it.
[9221.05s -> 9222.17s]  Ah, what was I trying to do there?
[9222.81s -> 9223.31s]  Sorry.
[9226.20s -> 9227.24s]  No, it's not time yet.
[9227.80s -> 9228.60s]  I'm still streaming.
[9230.02s -> 9231.22s]  My Super Bowl's not over yet.
[9232.84s -> 9233.90s]  What the heck?
[9233.90s -> 9237.74s]  My eight foot sub cater order
[9237.74s -> 9238.78s]  didn't even get here yet.
[9239.42s -> 9254.76s]  Holy shit.
[9254.76s -> 9255.56s]  You fucked up bad.
[9267.05s -> 9268.57s]  Okay, I don't even want to hear that kind of.
[9268.57s -> 9269.53s]  What the hell are you saying?
[9271.61s -> 9273.75s]  The deep pass.
[9275.43s -> 9277.75s]  And it's complete at the seven yard line.
[9289.30s -> 9293.54s]  Hurt him.
[9294.47s -> 9295.11s]  No injury there.
[9299.13s -> 9300.41s]  Oh, the signature.
[9300.41s -> 9300.97s]  Look at me.
[9301.77s -> 9320.15s]  What are we hurting?
[9320.15s -> 9320.65s]  Uh-oh.
[9323.22s -> 9323.70s]  Nope.
[9323.70s -> 9324.58s]  I thought it was, uh.
[9329.93s -> 9331.05s]  I thought it was something else.
[9332.55s -> 9334.79s]  We still have not seen the worst.
[9334.79s -> 9336.63s]  The offense looking at first and 30.
[9339.61s -> 9341.69s]  Which is the defense.
[9341.69s -> 9345.72s]  God, he's outbound.
[9346.28s -> 9350.90s]  Prevent.
[9350.90s -> 9351.38s]  Prevent.
[9351.38s -> 9351.94s]  Deep zones.
[9352.82s -> 9353.86s]  He passes all the time.
[9357.58s -> 9362.97s]  That's not what I call prevention.
[9364.82s -> 9365.86s]  That's not prevention.
[9371.74s -> 9372.38s]  So that's it.
[9372.38s -> 9373.42s]  Patriots win the Super Bowl.
[9375.18s -> 9380.46s]  That's it.
[9381.24s -> 9382.44s]  The New England Patriots
[9383.64s -> 9385.00s]  have won the Super Bowl
[9386.12s -> 9387.96s]  for the tenth time in a row.
[9390.33s -> 9391.05s]  There it is.
[9391.77s -> 9392.41s]  They did it.
[9393.45s -> 9395.21s]  I can't believe they did it.
[9396.09s -> 9410.84s]  But, uh.
[9414.15s -> 9416.55s]  Yeah, congratulations to Tom Brady.
[9417.51s -> 9418.57s]  You can now.
[9419.53s -> 9421.21s]  Essentially now Tom Brady is the one.
[9421.21s -> 9422.81s]  When Tom Brady eventually like dies.
[9423.61s -> 9425.13s]  Like in, you know, 50 years.
[9426.95s -> 9428.31s]  He's won so many Super Bowls.
[9429.51s -> 9430.95s]  They're gonna like future Ramaham.
[9431.67s -> 9436.81s]  He'll be doing like press conferences still.
[9445.42s -> 9446.14s]  Oh, that one hit.
[9447.02s -> 9447.52s]  Got it.
[9447.52s -> 9448.02s]  Perception.
[9448.97s -> 9449.47s]  Oh.
[9451.13s -> 9453.21s]  He fell down and turned his braid off.
[9453.21s -> 9453.71s]  No.
[9454.33s -> 9454.97s]  No, that was me.
[9460.84s -> 9461.40s]  Oh, shit.
[9461.40s -> 9461.90s]  That's bad.
[9462.84s -> 9466.68s]  Hen's game of the loss.
[9466.68s -> 9467.18s]  That sucks.
[9468.36s -> 9473.02s]  It's fucking shaggy.
[9473.02s -> 9473.58s]  All right.
[9473.58s -> 9474.78s]  We both have unleashed.
[9478.36s -> 9479.24s]  Eaves it deep.
[9480.12s -> 9482.76s]  Out of bounds at the 47 yard line.
[9482.76s -> 9483.40s]  I actually caught it.
[9483.40s -> 9483.80s]  Holy shit.
[9483.80s -> 9484.30s]  Hold on.
[9485.16s -> 9487.05s]  I don't think I caught that.
[9488.01s -> 9489.21s]  I think I caught that out of bound.
[9490.01s -> 9492.64s]  I can't do like slow motion.
[9495.37s -> 9496.54s]  Is one foot?
[9497.72s -> 9498.22s]  Nope.
[9498.68s -> 9499.58s]  Whatever.
[9499.58s -> 9500.06s]  It's in my favor.
[9500.06s -> 9500.56s]  I don't care.
[9504.12s -> 9509.31s]  Brady now has the final stone for this bump.
[9510.35s -> 9510.99s]  Yeah, you guys.
[9510.99s -> 9512.19s]  Everyone should be concerned about this.
[9514.35s -> 9521.95s]  Oh, look at me.
[9521.95s -> 9522.45s]  Look at me.
[9527.26s -> 9529.18s]  I thought I was gonna get really hurt.
[9530.22s -> 9530.72s]  Okay.
[9534.51s -> 9537.95s]  Oh, shit.
[9538.83s -> 9540.03s]  Stop pausing.
[9540.03s -> 9541.07s]  And so at halftime.
[9542.43s -> 9543.71s]  Leads by 16.
[9556.44s -> 9557.88s]  Sorry for the YouTuber scream.
[9557.88s -> 9558.38s]  I'm sorry.
[9560.92s -> 9569.69s]  He's gone for like the rest of the year.
[9571.05s -> 9572.88s]  It's always the spleen.
[9572.88s -> 9573.68s]  You're gone forever.
[9575.10s -> 9576.86s]  See you in eight games the whole season.
[9580.78s -> 9585.90s]  That's what you get for making me lose and be stupid and taunt you.
[9586.70s -> 9588.38s]  That's what you get from me taunting you.
[9595.52s -> 9597.12s]  I gotta get in there and get that.
[9597.44s -> 9597.94s]  Quarterback.
[9601.28s -> 9603.87s]  I gotta get in there.
[9615.53s -> 9620.80s]  He recovered from the concussion.
[9621.95s -> 9622.67s]  I almost got it.
[9623.39s -> 9625.85s]  We'll do spy man.
[9627.77s -> 9628.81s]  One more good dirty hit.
[9629.71s -> 9630.91s]  And I'll have enough to try to take up.
[9634.25s -> 9634.75s]  What?
[9641.10s -> 9642.78s]  My guy just stopped moving.
[9642.78s -> 9643.74s]  Oh, fuck the button.
[9644.38s -> 9662.80s]  Oh, stay up.
[9662.80s -> 9663.30s]  Stay up.
[9666.88s -> 9671.28s]  Uh, what about the sling?
[9671.28s -> 9672.08s]  Let's go with the sling.
[9673.82s -> 9675.82s]  I don't, I'm not going to use my own leads here.
[9679.20s -> 9679.68s]  Give me a cut.
[9679.68s -> 9680.18s]  Give me a cut.
[9681.20s -> 9681.70s]  There he is.
[9694.54s -> 9695.18s]  Let's go for a bolt.
[9695.18s -> 9695.68s]  Bolt pass.
[9696.62s -> 9697.12s]  Cut right.
[9702.92s -> 9705.00s]  What an unbelievable catch but not good enough.
[9706.49s -> 9706.99s]  Dammit.
[9707.31s -> 9708.43s]  He's gonna come back and haunt me.
[9709.23s -> 9714.83s]  The crowd is twitch chat.
[9715.79s -> 9716.96s]  Yeah, I could see that.
[9719.50s -> 9723.63s]  How did you not catch that?
[9725.15s -> 9725.87s]  Honest to god.
[9726.43s -> 9727.39s]  How did you not get that?
[9728.27s -> 9734.72s]  Wait, where's this guy going?
[9736.66s -> 9737.30s]  Beautiful move.
[9737.86s -> 9738.58s]  Beautiful fumble.
[9741.38s -> 9742.58s]  Why did he run that way?
[9742.58s -> 9743.78s]  I ran him that way.
[9743.78s -> 9744.28s]  Fuck me.
[9750.66s -> 9755.25s]  Not this time.
[9755.25s -> 9756.37s]  How the fuck?
[9756.37s -> 9758.62s]  This quarterback is too good.
[9759.26s -> 9760.77s]  I have to win by 20 points.
[9761.49s -> 9763.68s]  I'm trying to do a not terrible.
[9764.40s -> 9770.16s]  What if Jerma was one of us?
[9773.34s -> 9783.42s]  The Super Bowls are gonna win.
[9783.42s -> 9785.10s]  I can't believe the Patriots won the Super Bowl again.
[9785.98s -> 9797.10s]  How'd you run out of bounds there?
[9797.66s -> 9802.61s]  There's no reason for you to run out of bounds.
[9803.25s -> 9804.29s]  You had an opportunity to run.
[9809.46s -> 9809.96s]  Damn.
[9810.58s -> 9811.46s]  Turnover on downs.
[9811.46s -> 9811.96s]  Didn't get it.
[9812.90s -> 9813.70s]  It's third.
[9813.70s -> 9815.06s]  All right, it's my opportunity to make it.
[9815.70s -> 9816.98s]  My $15,000 bet.
[9817.70s -> 9820.80s]  Let's run it.
[9822.22s -> 9823.58s]  First down and 30.
[9825.01s -> 9829.28s]  I'll take it.
[9832.18s -> 9834.74s]  Uh, is this game online or is he playing against himself?
[9834.74s -> 9835.54s]  I'm just playing against you.
[9835.54s -> 9837.46s]  As we reach the end of the third quarter,
[9837.46s -> 9839.46s]  Las Vegas leads by 22.
[9839.46s -> 9840.98s]  This is an old PlayStation 3 game.
[9842.26s -> 9843.14s]  What's the League 2?
[9844.26s -> 9844.76s]  It is.
[9844.82s -> 9846.98s]  Sometimes I wish I was just sitting down there with a...
[9846.98s -> 9848.34s]  This was definitely one of the best.
[9849.06s -> 9850.34s]  Sit down with like a buddy.
[9850.98s -> 9852.74s]  And just shit talk to each other and play again.
[9853.86s -> 9854.36s]  Lofts one.
[9854.36s -> 9861.25s]  And the defender gets a hand on it and it's incomplete.
[9867.92s -> 9869.48s]  Sit down with a buddy.
[9870.12s -> 9874.66s]  Doesn't bounce, right?
[9874.66s -> 9876.18s]  Looks like they'll have four more downs to work with.
[9877.14s -> 9877.78s]  All right, here it is.
[9878.98s -> 9879.46s]  Red zone.
[9879.46s -> 9880.58s]  We're gonna go run right up the middle.
[9880.58s -> 9882.82s]  Let's see if the offense can keep it going here in the red zone.
[9884.82s -> 9887.97s]  Oh, did I lose yards?
[9888.77s -> 9890.37s]  I don't think I'm fighting right now.
[9893.25s -> 9893.75s]  Again.
[9893.75s -> 9894.77s]  Fifth play of the drive.
[9896.96s -> 9901.19s]  Touchdown!
[9901.19s -> 9905.19s]  Las Vegas refuses to call off the dogs as they add to their lead.
[9906.15s -> 9907.59s]  And I got a big bet riding on this.
[9908.71s -> 9911.70s]  Just field goal.
[9911.70s -> 9912.74s]  I want to keep my unleash.
[9920.50s -> 9921.14s]  It's good.
[9921.78s -> 9926.58s]  Just gotta hold him.
[9927.38s -> 9935.60s]  If you remember, I was there when rage quit Jets sent radio.
[9935.60s -> 9937.76s]  Were you there when I exploded the guy's balls?
[9937.76s -> 9954.00s]  It didn't happen, but.
[9958.98s -> 9959.62s]  44.
[9959.62s -> 9960.90s]  I'm stroying with now.
[9972.05s -> 9974.63s]  This is not even a contest anymore.
[9975.97s -> 9977.09s]  He's very injured, too.
[9977.97s -> 9978.77s]  Look at this guy.
[9978.77s -> 9980.13s]  This guy's in pain.
[9981.89s -> 9982.69s]  Oh, wrong guy.
[9983.49s -> 9984.69s]  This is the guy standing next to him.
[9985.41s -> 9987.68s]  More like dumb luck.
[9990.00s -> 9990.88s]  That one's already been used.
[9993.60s -> 9995.04s]  All right, I got an unleash.
[9995.04s -> 9996.96s]  Let's take the quarterback out of the game.
[9996.96s -> 9998.00s]  And out of the seat.
[10000.88s -> 10002.63s]  And now I'm in.
[10003.51s -> 10008.15s]  Oh, he's gonna be funny about it.
[10020.02s -> 10021.94s]  Yeah, you get a little prize.
[10021.94s -> 10022.98s]  You got 13 points.
[10022.98s -> 10023.46s]  Good for you.
[10025.54s -> 10026.92s]  Get it!
[10028.69s -> 10030.21s]  I'm caring so much about trying to
[10030.21s -> 10031.17s]  kill the quarterback.
[10031.81s -> 10038.37s]  Let's turn off the announcer.
[10042.36s -> 10043.56s]  Do you really want me to turn him off?
[10044.60s -> 10049.06s]  It's all right.
[10049.06s -> 10050.79s]  He was resilient.
[10051.59s -> 10056.71s]  Okay, our new mantra is run the ball, burn the clock.
[10056.71s -> 10057.91s]  Yeah, run the ball, burn the clock.
[10063.80s -> 10071.73s]  Oh, I punched him so hard in the face.
[10071.73s -> 10072.45s]  Oh, look at me!
[10078.34s -> 10079.38s]  I punched him.
[10079.38s -> 10080.18s]  I punched him so bad.
[10082.18s -> 10083.14s]  Very nice run.
[10083.14s -> 10086.90s]  His legs never stop moving and his eyes never stop looking for Dayla.
[10086.90s -> 10089.86s]  Let's go with the pass.
[10089.86s -> 10091.06s]  I have 50 points.
[10103.49s -> 10104.85s]  Well, I thought it was going to be circle weather.
[10105.73s -> 10108.12s]  Look, when you're up by 50 points, you kind of just...
[10108.76s -> 10110.04s]  Can I take off my starters?
[10110.84s -> 10121.76s]  Let's go with the PS.
[10121.76s -> 10123.04s]  My controller turned off.
[10123.04s -> 10123.68s]  Is that a battery?
[10124.24s -> 10125.20s]  I need a battery right now.
[10125.84s -> 10129.73s]  The offense looking at first and 30.
[10130.37s -> 10131.48s]  I need a plug.
[10134.20s -> 10141.46s]  This one fits, right?
[10142.26s -> 10145.43s]  It does.
[10152.23s -> 10153.43s]  Where's the USB?
[10153.43s -> 10153.99s]  It's right here.
[10154.79s -> 10157.35s]  The offense has a ways to go here on second down.
[10158.47s -> 10159.99s]  How do you get the USB in here?
[10166.08s -> 10167.28s]  All right, I'm plugged back in.
[10168.98s -> 10170.10s]  We're good, I think.
[10173.89s -> 10174.69s]  It's just blinking.
[10178.07s -> 10178.79s]  How do I do this?
[10179.59s -> 10183.32s]  Why is it not just syncing?
[10184.04s -> 10184.92s]  Why does it have to sync?
[10191.65s -> 10192.95s]  Got it.
[10192.95s -> 10193.67s]  Okay, it's back, it's back.
[10199.43s -> 10200.79s]  Hey, yeah, that's not fair.
[10200.79s -> 10201.83s]  That's fine, yeah.
[10202.63s -> 10215.89s]  You get to play against a non-opponent for a minute.
[10215.89s -> 10219.60s]  What?
[10219.60s -> 10221.04s]  I intercepted the ball?
[10221.60s -> 10222.48s]  Did he throw it in?
[10227.99s -> 10228.39s]  I don't...
[10233.17s -> 10233.73s]  No.
[10233.73s -> 10234.05s]  How do...
[10234.05s -> 10235.41s]  I wish I could slow this down.
[10236.82s -> 10238.98s]  There's no way to slow it down, huh?
[10248.64s -> 10254.84s]  I don't know.
[10254.84s -> 10255.34s]  Nice work.
[10255.96s -> 10258.71s]  All right, let's just throw an end zone pass.
[10259.43s -> 10262.47s]  See if I can get to 58 points.
[10275.27s -> 10277.92s]  You're not on code again.
[10279.14s -> 10280.26s]  58 points, let's get it.
[10281.14s -> 10288.02s]  Oh my god, what are you doing?
[10288.74s -> 10288.98s]  What?
[10288.98s -> 10309.43s]  Oh, this poor guy.
[10309.43s -> 10313.03s]  And so, Las Vegas is your winner here tonight.
[10313.03s -> 10315.30s]  For the wrong code, joke isn't a joke.
[10316.10s -> 10319.16s]  No, I'm just trying to find other codes.
[10321.22s -> 10324.02s]  I'm just doing random buttons to try to find other codes.
[10324.66s -> 10325.62s]  Because there's a shitload of them.
[10328.80s -> 10329.44s]  All right, I got...
[10329.44s -> 10330.32s]  I'm gonna get a lot of money.
[10330.32s -> 10332.80s]  I had a lot of points, a lot of dirty hits, a lot of flashes.
[10334.63s -> 10335.27s]  Touchdowns.
[10337.81s -> 10338.61s]  Yeah, 400 grand.
[10342.88s -> 10344.16s]  Uh, I got some movies.
[10345.36s -> 10345.84s]  Very cool.
[10346.56s -> 10348.58s]  What's my sweat like?
[10348.58s -> 10349.70s]  But I'm not...
[10349.70s -> 10350.10s]  I'm fine.
[10350.82s -> 10354.05s]  We're about to make it into the next...
[10354.05s -> 10354.69s]  We're about to win.
[10358.61s -> 10359.25s]  Agent.
[10359.25s -> 10362.50s]  Franchise, main man, you feeling pumped?
[10362.50s -> 10364.04s]  Because I'm feeling...
[10364.04s -> 10365.96s]  This is it, the big bucks, baby.
[10365.96s -> 10367.96s]  Your first commercial shoot.
[10367.96s -> 10370.36s]  You just suit up and do everything I tell you.
[10370.36s -> 10372.44s]  And let the cameraman do the rest.
[10372.44s -> 10376.20s]  You nail this and we will have the sponsors eating out of our hands.
[10376.20s -> 10379.72s]  Okay, I got to score at least three touchdowns against Detroit.
[10380.28s -> 10386.92s]  No new sponsors.
[10389.64s -> 10390.20s]  Training.
[10390.20s -> 10390.92s]  Let's take a look.
[10391.72s -> 10394.07s]  I want to take a look at how everybody's doing, too.
[10394.07s -> 10395.27s]  So I got 400 grand.
[10396.39s -> 10398.31s]  Resist injury is probably a good idea.
[10398.31s -> 10398.79s]  Speed.
[10402.68s -> 10409.41s]  Passing.
[10410.05s -> 10415.28s]  Grip master, more strength.
[10418.53s -> 10419.25s]  I'm gonna do speed.
[10420.29s -> 10421.17s]  Speed and...
[10422.05s -> 10426.72s]  Speed and passing.
[10427.78s -> 10429.22s]  I might be able to do one more.
[10429.22s -> 10430.10s]  And resist injury.
[10433.00s -> 10435.22s]  Big spender.
[10435.22s -> 10436.34s]  All right, so we're doing all right.
[10439.28s -> 10440.56s]  75 tackle.
[10440.56s -> 10442.16s]  People are ranking up.
[10447.84s -> 10448.96s]  Oh, I have to actually...
[10448.96s -> 10450.88s]  Okay, train the attributes now.
[10450.88s -> 10451.84s]  So this is me.
[10452.80s -> 10455.91s]  Oh, I gotta set it to automatic.
[10458.42s -> 10459.46s]  It's on automatic, isn't it?
[10464.28s -> 10465.56s]  Pass and kick plus five.
[10468.00s -> 10469.04s]  Hands, strength.
[10469.92s -> 10471.60s]  Break tackle is so bad.
[10479.67s -> 10481.27s]  Yeah, just keep it there.
[10481.27s -> 10482.98s]  That's fine.
[10482.98s -> 10483.62s]  Yeah, it is doing it.
[10483.62s -> 10484.98s]  It's doing it automatically.
[10484.98s -> 10485.38s]  I see.
[10485.94s -> 10486.58s]  Okay, we're good.
[10488.08s -> 10488.88s]  How about drugs?
[10489.52s -> 10491.54s]  I got 50 grand.
[10491.54s -> 10493.70s]  Let's go with turbo bar.
[10493.70s -> 10494.42s]  Reduce the...
[10494.42s -> 10495.30s]  Turbo bar drain.
[10501.43s -> 10502.63s]  Let's reduce the stamina loss.
[10503.19s -> 10506.98s]  Let's also give this again.
[10509.16s -> 10510.68s]  Turbo bar to the halfback.
[10514.16s -> 10514.96s]  I don't want to get arrested,
[10514.96s -> 10516.00s]  so I'm gonna keep it like that.
[10516.74s -> 10517.78s]  Although, let's go to defense.
[10521.38s -> 10523.84s]  I'm gonna get in trouble.
[10524.40s -> 10525.67s]  All right, let's go.
[10526.47s -> 10528.84s]  This is the Detroit Devils.
[10529.48s -> 10535.33s]  4-0.
[10536.05s -> 10537.97s]  Las Vegas must win by more than 23 points.
[10541.00s -> 10541.48s]  Max bet.
[10543.35s -> 10545.75s]  This week, we've got the Detroit Devils.
[10545.75s -> 10546.71s]  Once upon a time,
[10546.71s -> 10547.91s]  this was a pretty good team.
[10548.63s -> 10550.55s]  But there's a cancer in that locker room,
[10550.55s -> 10552.23s]  and his name is Cookie Wallace.
[10553.03s -> 10554.07s]  On a good day,
[10554.07s -> 10556.07s]  Cookie is one of the best receivers in the game.
[10558.63s -> 10559.43s]  Thing is,
[10559.43s -> 10561.67s]  he ain't having as many good days as he used to.
[10562.79s -> 10563.59s]  And of course,
[10563.59s -> 10566.15s]  he blames everyone else for his screw-ups.
[10566.95s -> 10568.63s]  So the team sucks,
[10568.63s -> 10569.11s]  but he's...
[10570.23s -> 10572.21s]  I don't understand.
[10572.93s -> 10575.24s]  So maybe I should leave him in the game.
[10575.80s -> 10579.72s]  Should I just not try to hurt him?
[10579.72s -> 10582.26s]  If the team sucks when he's on it,
[10582.26s -> 10583.06s]  I should leave him be.
[10589.88s -> 10591.32s]  Selfish and undisciplined.
[10593.35s -> 10593.67s]  Okay.
[10600.07s -> 10601.03s]  Go after everyone else.
[10601.03s -> 10602.07s]  Thanks for joining us.
[10602.07s -> 10604.39s]  We're partway through the Division 3 season,
[10604.39s -> 10606.55s]  and this team has been making some noise.
[10606.55s -> 10607.75s]  Let's hope they can keep it up.
[10607.75s -> 10609.67s]  And now let's get ready for the kickoff.
[10610.87s -> 10611.99s]  Come on.
[10611.99s -> 10613.11s]  Why does that keep happening?
[10614.47s -> 10615.75s]  Looks like a fumble shoot.
[10615.75s -> 10615.91s]  Okay.
[10615.91s -> 10617.11s]  Whoever that is.
[10617.11s -> 10617.67s]  82?
[10618.95s -> 10619.83s]  Fuck you, 82.
[10619.83s -> 10621.03s]  That was ridiculous.
[10621.03s -> 10621.59s]  Come on, now.
[10622.63s -> 10630.26s]  Damn.
[10630.26s -> 10630.82s]  Uh-oh.
[10632.79s -> 10634.39s]  Oh, that's a neck cleat.
[10639.33s -> 10640.05s]  There's Robbie.
[10641.49s -> 10642.61s]  That guy's on drugs, too.
[10642.61s -> 10643.41s]  I gotta get him back in.
[10643.41s -> 10644.13s]  Hold on, buddy.
[10644.13s -> 10645.09s]  Look at the run in the background.
[10645.09s -> 10646.53s]  Hey, get the cart out here.
[10646.53s -> 10647.41s]  I gotta make this good.
[10647.41s -> 10648.05s]  Take it easy, buddy.
[10648.05s -> 10649.01s]  It'll be over in a second.
[10650.53s -> 10651.01s]  That's all right.
[10651.01s -> 10652.13s]  Take it easy, buddy.
[10652.37s -> 10653.97s]  Three plays and one stamina boost.
[10656.93s -> 10658.56s]  All right.
[10658.56s -> 10659.92s]  This team is kind of hurting me.
[10663.86s -> 10664.34s]  That's smart.
[10665.06s -> 10672.00s]  Just like those are the reason that man needs to be a big part of this offense.
[10672.00s -> 10673.04s]  Exemplary catch.
[10673.04s -> 10674.32s]  I'm not doing any running plays.
[10674.32s -> 10675.12s]  I don't have my hat back.
[10678.13s -> 10679.49s]  And he's the one on drugs.
[10679.49s -> 10680.53s]  I gotta keep him okay.
[10681.73s -> 10682.13s]  Cut it.
[10682.13s -> 10682.45s]  Cut it.
[10682.45s -> 10683.09s]  Somebody cut it.
[10683.89s -> 10685.52s]  Just short of the first.
[10686.85s -> 10687.17s]  All right.
[10687.17s -> 10687.73s]  I gotta run.
[10687.73s -> 10688.53s]  I have to.
[10688.53s -> 10689.57s]  I'm gonna do a QB sneak.
[10689.57s -> 10691.41s]  No, he made it here on time.
[10692.13s -> 10692.61s]  I'm just running.
[10692.61s -> 10693.49s]  I'm gonna walk over the...
[10693.49s -> 10694.61s]  I'm walking over the line right now.
[10694.61s -> 10695.33s]  Three, two, one, go.
[10700.61s -> 10709.62s]  God damn it.
[10709.62s -> 10710.10s]  It's all right.
[10717.28s -> 10718.80s]  It's because my halfback got hurt.
[10718.80s -> 10720.00s]  I would have ran with the halfback.
[10723.84s -> 10724.96s]  Kill somebody already.
[10724.96s -> 10725.44s]  I...
[10725.44s -> 10726.24s]  I got killed.
[10728.40s -> 10729.52s]  My guy was injured.
[10729.52s -> 10729.68s]  I...
[10738.52s -> 10738.84s]  Guys.
[10739.56s -> 10740.84s]  Oh, I had an opportunity.
[10740.84s -> 10741.88s]  But it's okay.
[10741.88s -> 10742.76s]  As long as I keep him.
[10743.32s -> 10743.80s]  Third down.
[10744.52s -> 10747.27s]  Let's do some zones here.
[10752.34s -> 10755.57s]  Oh, damn it.
[10755.57s -> 10756.85s]  He unleashed to catch it.
[10756.85s -> 10758.53s]  It's a free catch if you unleash.
[10758.53s -> 10758.77s]  Fuck.
[10759.41s -> 10763.49s]  God damn halfback got injured in the first play.
[10763.49s -> 10764.77s]  And then I fumbled the ball.
[10765.49s -> 10767.62s]  It's still early.
[10778.34s -> 10782.90s]  Is Vegas falling from grace?
[10783.86s -> 10784.58s]  No, not yet.
[10785.22s -> 10787.03s]  I'll take it back here.
[10787.03s -> 10788.23s]  I'm gonna get my halfback.
[10788.23s -> 10789.43s]  He's gonna come back.
[10789.43s -> 10793.44s]  This is the turnaround right here.
[10794.00s -> 10797.38s]  They're pretty rough.
[10798.34s -> 10800.24s]  Holy...
[10800.88s -> 10802.24s]  Good thing he's got insurance.
[10803.60s -> 10804.08s]  There he is.
[10804.88s -> 10805.60s]  There you go.
[10805.60s -> 10806.80s]  You're all right, buddy.
[10806.80s -> 10807.36s]  Robbie's back.
[10808.16s -> 10808.72s]  Next play.
[10813.22s -> 10818.36s]  There it is.
[10818.36s -> 10819.32s]  Let's bring it back.
[10819.32s -> 10820.20s]  Don't taunt.
[10820.20s -> 10821.64s]  Just score the fucking touchdown.
[10831.16s -> 10831.88s]  I gotta take the lead.
[10831.88s -> 10832.60s]  Let's go.
[10832.60s -> 10833.08s]  Take the lead.
[10839.00s -> 10839.24s]  Yes!
[10840.04s -> 10840.76s]  Across the plane.
[10849.36s -> 10850.08s]  Look up codes.
[10850.80s -> 10851.20s]  I mean, I'm...
[10853.40s -> 10853.80s]  Oh, no.
[10854.36s -> 10855.16s]  Oh, no.
[10855.16s -> 10855.80s]  Oh, no.
[10857.08s -> 10857.32s]  No.
[10859.96s -> 10860.60s]  Look up codes.
[10860.60s -> 10861.72s]  I was looking at chat.
[10879.06s -> 10881.44s]  I got it.
[10881.44s -> 10882.40s]  Killed Cookie.
[10882.40s -> 10882.72s]  I know.
[10883.52s -> 10888.18s]  There's gonna be a back and forth here.
[10888.18s -> 10889.38s]  And all I need is a touchdown.
[10890.18s -> 10891.00s]  I got the two.
[10891.00s -> 10892.12s]  They didn't get a two-point conversion.
[10892.12s -> 10892.44s]  I did.
[10893.16s -> 10903.32s]  All right.
[10903.32s -> 10904.04s]  They got an unleash.
[10904.04s -> 10904.92s]  I'm about to have one.
[10905.72s -> 10909.57s]  I gotta...
[10909.57s -> 10910.21s]  I gotta run it out.
[10910.21s -> 10911.89s]  I gotta pass and run out of bounds.
[10911.89s -> 10912.93s]  I have to get that.
[10912.93s -> 10914.29s]  Otherwise, I'm gonna get fumbled again.
[10915.25s -> 10927.78s]  Let's hug the right side.
[10930.47s -> 10934.92s]  Stay!
[10934.92s -> 10935.16s]  No!
[10935.96s -> 10936.92s]  Out of bounds, please.
[10939.65s -> 10940.05s]  Yeah!
[10942.24s -> 10942.72s]  Yes!
[10942.72s -> 10944.32s]  And so at the end of one quarter...
[10944.32s -> 10945.60s]  Wow, that was lucky.
[10945.60s -> 10946.72s]  Leads by six.
[10947.84s -> 10950.60s]  Aren't you guys lotioning up your hands?
[10950.60s -> 10952.76s]  I need to upgrade the hands.
[10952.76s -> 10954.04s]  It's bad.
[10954.04s -> 10955.08s]  It's very bad.
[10955.08s -> 10956.12s]  I need to upgrade hands.
[10956.92s -> 10957.72s]  First and goal.
[10957.72s -> 10958.92s]  It's gut check time.
[10958.92s -> 10960.52s]  Ball at the 22-yard line.
[10961.88s -> 10965.64s]  Goes way downfield.
[10965.64s -> 10966.52s]  He's got it.
[10966.52s -> 10967.08s]  Touchdown.
[10975.76s -> 10978.32s]  So I have an unleash.
[10978.32s -> 10978.96s]  It's tied up.
[10979.84s -> 10981.33s]  Oh, should I be safe?
[10981.33s -> 10983.57s]  Okay, we got the set.
[10983.57s -> 10984.69s]  We're picking up the trail
[10984.69s -> 10986.37s]  and we'll check up like the dogs they are.
[10987.33s -> 11004.36s]  Okay, tie game.
[11007.00s -> 11007.64s]  Injury time.
[11010.24s -> 11011.44s]  No, I wanted to select it,
[11011.44s -> 11012.24s]  but I couldn't get it.
[11017.20s -> 11018.72s]  Cycles through like everybody on the team.
[11019.92s -> 11022.28s]  No, I...
[11022.28s -> 11023.00s]  Let me hit him.
[11024.44s -> 11025.16s]  Let me hit him.
[11026.04s -> 11026.84s]  Stop getting in my way.
[11027.64s -> 11040.48s]  Did that just happen?
[11042.24s -> 11043.04s]  That just happened.
[11043.04s -> 11045.12s]  It just comes easy to this guy.
[11045.12s -> 11046.16s]  Sure, he works hard.
[11046.16s -> 11046.80s]  He has talent.
[11046.80s -> 11047.36s]  I can't believe it.
[11047.36s -> 11049.84s]  But that's what makes these sorts of plays so easy for him.
[11049.84s -> 11050.40s]  Bravo.
[11051.76s -> 11052.48s]  Or injury.
[11052.48s -> 11052.98s]  Heart.
[11054.72s -> 11056.88s]  He lets it fly.
[11056.88s -> 11058.56s]  And he makes the grab.
[11058.56s -> 11059.84s]  Oh, man!
[11059.84s -> 11060.64s]  Hookie Wallace.
[11062.00s -> 11064.07s]  If they would just get out of my way
[11064.07s -> 11065.19s]  and let me tackle them,
[11065.19s -> 11067.03s]  I would have tackled them two plays ago.
[11073.27s -> 11074.79s]  He was right in my line of sight.
[11074.79s -> 11075.59s]  I have an unleash
[11075.59s -> 11076.95s]  and some guy bumped into it.
[11077.59s -> 11080.02s]  They're making this hard for me, guys.
[11080.02s -> 11081.06s]  Get out of my fucking way.
[11081.06s -> 11081.70s]  I'm the captain.
[11081.70s -> 11082.90s]  I say what I say goes.
[11083.54s -> 11092.29s]  Who gets the ball?
[11092.93s -> 11102.82s]  That's who.
[11104.45s -> 11105.81s]  You got the smelling salts?
[11105.81s -> 11106.61s]  Yeah, yeah.
[11106.61s -> 11107.17s]  Hold on.
[11107.17s -> 11107.49s]  You know what?
[11107.49s -> 11107.89s]  Never mind.
[11107.89s -> 11108.93s]  Let's just get the card out here.
[11108.93s -> 11110.05s]  That's a good idea.
[11110.05s -> 11110.85s]  Yeah, bring it up.
[11114.08s -> 11114.64s]  Oh, no.
[11115.44s -> 11116.48s]  Oh, that's not good.
[11117.12s -> 11118.24s]  That's not good.
[11120.87s -> 11121.67s]  Actually dead.
[11123.30s -> 11124.42s]  Oh, God.
[11124.98s -> 11126.10s]  This is not going well.
[11127.14s -> 11128.74s]  He's going long.
[11128.74s -> 11130.82s]  And it's complete at the 46 yard line.
[11130.82s -> 11132.58s]  Two unleashed just ran into each other.
[11132.58s -> 11133.14s]  That's what happens.
[11134.90s -> 11136.68s]  Oh, nice pass.
[11137.24s -> 11137.88s]  Wish I had that.
[11139.64s -> 11146.53s]  Get over that first down.
[11147.33s -> 11148.05s]  Did you get it?
[11148.77s -> 11149.25s]  I didn't get it.
[11149.25s -> 11149.81s]  No, that's not.
[11149.81s -> 11150.85s]  No, it's not what I said.
[11151.41s -> 11153.25s]  I said if it was up to me.
[11153.25s -> 11154.05s]  It's not.
[11154.05s -> 11156.13s]  But the offense is looking at third and short.
[11162.24s -> 11162.74s]  Get it.
[11164.00s -> 11165.78s]  First down.
[11166.82s -> 11169.08s]  We're doing all right.
[11169.08s -> 11169.88s]  Everything's going fine.
[11170.68s -> 11173.97s]  Let's try to run it here.
[11179.57s -> 11181.09s]  Who wins in the unleashed fight?
[11181.89s -> 11182.93s]  Who wins?
[11184.96s -> 11185.44s]  Time out.
[11185.44s -> 11185.92s]  Time out.
[11186.56s -> 11190.80s]  I still have my unleashed.
[11191.36s -> 11195.65s]  I got it.
[11205.11s -> 11205.99s]  You've got to be kidding me.
[11205.99s -> 11208.47s]  And so at halftime Detroit leads by seven.
[11208.47s -> 11209.51s]  That was an unleashed catch.
[11209.51s -> 11210.31s]  It's supposed to be guaranteed.
[11211.35s -> 11223.65s]  All right.
[11223.65s -> 11224.05s]  Injured.
[11227.41s -> 11227.97s]  Injury.
[11228.93s -> 11229.17s]  No.
[11229.81s -> 11230.13s]  Why?
[11230.69s -> 11231.57s]  It's not fair.
[11231.57s -> 11231.97s]  Kill it.
[11234.10s -> 11234.82s]  Break is back.
[11236.77s -> 11237.09s]  Yes.
[11238.26s -> 11239.30s]  He's too good.
[11239.30s -> 11239.94s]  Get rid of him.
[11241.70s -> 11242.50s]  Oh, my God.
[11243.46s -> 11245.91s]  I think it's separated.
[11245.91s -> 11246.47s]  Stay down.
[11246.47s -> 11248.31s]  Cookie has made every single play.
[11248.31s -> 11249.75s]  He's made every single touchdown.
[11250.71s -> 11251.67s]  Not anymore.
[11251.67s -> 11252.15s]  You're out.
[11252.79s -> 11261.67s]  And everyone on the same page there.
[11261.67s -> 11263.67s]  And they are rewarded with a very nice game.
[11264.23s -> 11266.69s]  You only have five plays.
[11266.69s -> 11267.17s]  It's all right.
[11267.17s -> 11267.97s]  That's an entire.
[11275.01s -> 11277.09s]  I'm so amped up right now.
[11277.09s -> 11277.97s]  I've got to win.
[11277.97s -> 11279.01s]  I've got to go five and up.
[11279.81s -> 11280.61s]  I just fucked it up.
[11282.55s -> 11284.79s]  Oh, the receiver's taken out of the play.
[11284.79s -> 11285.83s]  And that's incomplete.
[11286.79s -> 11289.72s]  He falls on him.
[11290.28s -> 11292.61s]  Here's my guy.
[11293.33s -> 11300.18s]  He's just serious to let him get by you.
[11301.38s -> 11302.74s]  How could you let you hat you?
[11302.74s -> 11304.18s]  You were holding onto him.
[11306.98s -> 11308.26s]  How did you let that happen?
[11309.06s -> 11310.02s]  You tackled him.
[11310.02s -> 11311.14s]  And he just walked off.
[11312.10s -> 11314.07s]  This team's training.
[11315.52s -> 11317.28s]  I'm going to fucking close the door on this.
[11318.00s -> 11321.38s]  These idiots can't do anything on defense.
[11347.89s -> 11349.25s]  I'm just like pissed off.
[11349.25s -> 11351.57s]  At like Cookie, whatever his name is.
[11355.59s -> 11355.99s]  It's all right.
[11355.99s -> 11356.95s]  Keep it going.
[11356.95s -> 11364.28s]  Let's run it.
[11381.33s -> 11382.77s]  How have I not found a random code?
[11383.65s -> 11384.28s]  Okay.
[11384.28s -> 11385.72s]  I need this two point conversion.
[11385.72s -> 11387.08s]  I need it bad.
[11387.08s -> 11388.20s]  Very, very badly.
[11388.20s -> 11389.00s]  Very badly.
[11390.58s -> 11391.06s]  Let's go.
[11414.23s -> 11414.95s]  Cookie hurt him.
[11414.95s -> 11415.51s]  He's back in.
[11415.51s -> 11416.31s]  He's injured.
[11416.31s -> 11416.87s]  Make it work.
[11416.87s -> 11417.43s]  Make it happen.
[11420.93s -> 11421.65s]  Look at that stamina.
[11421.65s -> 11422.53s]  It's terrible.
[11422.53s -> 11423.41s]  And I have a...
[11423.41s -> 11423.89s]  I'm going to...
[11423.89s -> 11424.69s]  Let's go for him again.
[11427.51s -> 11428.23s]  Anticipate.
[11428.79s -> 11429.91s]  Cookie's coming over here.
[11432.92s -> 11433.89s]  There he is.
[11437.35s -> 11438.55s]  Nice try.
[11438.55s -> 11439.67s]  That was like a ballet move.
[11439.67s -> 11441.11s]  I don't think he knows what hit him.
[11453.33s -> 11454.37s]  That was a big sack.
[11457.12s -> 11458.24s]  Third and 39.
[11458.24s -> 11459.12s]  We're going to play cover.
[11459.12s -> 11461.20s]  I'm just man up in the zones.
[11462.79s -> 11465.03s]  There's no way you're going to get 40 goddamn yards there.
[11465.99s -> 11471.33s]  See you later.
[11471.33s -> 11471.81s]  My ball.
[11472.53s -> 11473.33s]  Fourth and 26.
[11473.33s -> 11474.05s]  They're definitely going to punt.
[11479.36s -> 11480.48s]  And I've got an unleash.
[11484.79s -> 11488.71s]  As we reach the end of the third quarter, Detroit leads by eight.
[11499.64s -> 11501.40s]  Now I need a two point conversion.
[11503.30s -> 11504.18s]  Yeah, I do.
[11505.22s -> 11505.78s]  I do now.
[11511.62s -> 11512.26s]  Down again.
[11515.76s -> 11517.44s]  You explained to me how during an unleash,
[11517.44s -> 11519.12s]  this guy is able to dirty hit me still.
[11524.61s -> 11525.89s]  All right, I've got to make the plays here.
[11534.26s -> 11539.83s]  Let's go for a run.
[11540.39s -> 11547.80s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[11548.52s -> 11550.60s]  I'm entering my unleash.
[11553.84s -> 11554.88s]  My unleash.
[11554.88s -> 11556.56s]  Why does it get stopped every time?
[11559.35s -> 11560.31s]  That was a default.
[11561.27s -> 11561.91s]  Oh, fuck.
[11563.67s -> 11566.39s]  That guy did a default tackle and I'm in a goddamn unleash.
[11567.19s -> 11568.23s]  I can't believe it.
[11568.23s -> 11568.63s]  It's okay.
[11574.95s -> 11581.75s]  Way to go here on third down for the big play.
[11588.85s -> 11591.49s]  Lots of quarterbacks can make a great pass in practice,
[11591.49s -> 11594.45s]  but it's out here during the game when the pros
[11594.45s -> 11597.01s]  really step forward with throws like that.
[11597.01s -> 11597.49s]  This is it.
[11601.51s -> 11611.46s]  I got to get that fucking ball back.
[11634.34s -> 11634.66s]  Yes.
[11636.32s -> 11637.68s]  Oh, yes.
[11637.68s -> 11638.80s]  I'm so involved.
[11639.91s -> 11640.55s]  Done.
[11640.55s -> 11641.35s]  Out for the season.
[11644.13s -> 11645.25s]  I'm going to call it card.
[11645.25s -> 11645.57s]  Okay.
[11645.57s -> 11647.01s]  I got to get this ball back.
[11647.01s -> 11647.17s]  Yeah.
[11647.17s -> 11648.29s]  Get it out here.
[11648.29s -> 11652.92s]  I'm getting too amped up over this game.
[11653.64s -> 11654.44s]  First and goal.
[11655.24s -> 11657.46s]  I have to stop them right now.
[11657.46s -> 11659.22s]  Crucial series of downs here.
[11659.22s -> 11660.10s]  They can't get a touchdown.
[11660.10s -> 11660.50s]  Stay back.
[11666.63s -> 11667.75s]  Get that fucking ball.
[11667.75s -> 11668.23s]  Fumble it.
[11669.03s -> 11673.30s]  I got an unleash.
[11673.30s -> 11674.26s]  I have to use it somehow.
[11674.82s -> 11677.19s]  Just pass into the end zone if there is.
[11678.15s -> 11681.32s]  I got to activate it and try to catch it.
[11682.28s -> 11684.74s]  There it is.
[11684.74s -> 11685.14s]  Fumble it.
[11688.90s -> 11690.82s]  How on earth did you not recover the fumble?
[11692.10s -> 11693.22s]  Oh, that's unbelievable.
[11693.22s -> 11694.10s]  I can't.
[11694.10s -> 11694.82s]  How?
[11694.82s -> 11696.10s]  Those three of you.
[11696.10s -> 11697.30s]  Running around in a circle around it.
[11697.86s -> 11698.34s]  Pick it up.
[11699.14s -> 11700.90s]  The offense might want to mix it up here.
[11700.90s -> 11703.06s]  They've been a little predictable the first two downs.
[11712.56s -> 11712.96s]  Take him.
[11713.84s -> 11714.88s]  He's out of bounds.
[11714.88s -> 11715.20s]  All right.
[11723.06s -> 11724.18s]  Don't let him run up the middle.
[11729.97s -> 11730.29s]  Yes.
[11731.09s -> 11731.33s]  Okay.
[11733.25s -> 11734.05s]  This is bad though.
[11734.05s -> 11734.85s]  This is very bad.
[11735.73s -> 11741.09s]  I'm in my own end zone.
[11744.53s -> 11746.37s]  I got to get out of my own end zone now.
[11746.37s -> 11747.25s]  I got two timeouts.
[11748.36s -> 11749.08s]  Oh, shit.
[11749.08s -> 11749.80s]  I have no meter.
[11758.12s -> 11758.44s]  Oops.
[11758.44s -> 11759.00s]  I know.
[11759.00s -> 11759.40s]  That's okay.
[11781.28s -> 11781.52s]  Okay.
[11781.52s -> 11782.64s]  I got one more play.
[11782.64s -> 11784.56s]  I got one last play.
[11784.56s -> 11785.36s]  Get in the end zone.
[11792.58s -> 11802.80s]  Yes.
[11803.86s -> 11804.18s]  Okay.
[11804.18s -> 11804.82s]  Just kick it.
[11807.84s -> 11809.28s]  Oh, I'm so excited.
[11810.32s -> 11811.44s]  I'm so happy.
[11811.44s -> 11812.88s]  I'm still, I'm going to be undefeated.
[11815.60s -> 11817.54s]  I'm getting way too invested in this.
[11819.40s -> 11820.36s]  They got one attempt here.
[11822.98s -> 11824.58s]  They have to run it back or touch it right now.
[11825.22s -> 11826.02s]  They don't have a meter.
[11829.01s -> 11829.57s]  Play smart.
[11832.15s -> 11832.63s]  Goodbye.
[11832.63s -> 11832.95s]  Right way.
[11837.91s -> 11838.47s]  God damn.
[11841.52s -> 11843.86s]  Oh, I felt that one in my bones.
[11857.81s -> 11859.33s]  I didn't cause a turnover at all.
[11860.53s -> 11861.33s]  I lost the wager.
[11861.33s -> 11861.73s]  It's all right.
[11863.09s -> 11865.11s]  I'm just happy to be undefeated.
[11865.67s -> 11870.10s]  That was better than the actual Super Bowl.
[11876.00s -> 11877.20s]  Killed a man and won the game.
[11878.08s -> 11878.32s]  All right.
[11878.32s -> 11878.80s]  We got a call.
[11880.18s -> 11881.14s]  Hey there.
[11881.14s -> 11883.06s]  I just got off the phone with the sponsor.
[11883.06s -> 11885.78s]  They love what they saw doing the commercial shoot.
[11885.78s -> 11887.78s]  We did a little negotiating and they're throwing
[11887.78s -> 11889.46s]  in some additional gear for your team.
[11890.26s -> 11892.82s]  You can thank me later.
[11893.70s -> 11896.28s]  It was killing a man worth that money.
[11896.28s -> 11896.92s]  Franchise.
[11896.92s -> 11897.48s]  Good news.
[11897.48s -> 11900.92s]  I've been working my magic and I've lined up another big name sponsor.
[11900.92s -> 11905.56s]  All we need to do to seal the deal is have you make that end zone your bitch this Sunday.
[11905.56s -> 11906.84s]  Think you can do that?
[11906.84s -> 11907.72s]  What am I saying?
[11907.72s -> 11909.00s]  Of course you can do that.
[11909.00s -> 11910.28s]  You're the franchise.
[11911.56s -> 11911.88s]  God.
[11912.84s -> 11917.96s]  So I have to get a gain of 50 plus yards on a single play.
[11918.92s -> 11925.94s]  Currently 5-0 against the Crusaders.
[11925.94s -> 11927.54s]  Let's see what we got for sponsors.
[11930.36s -> 11930.84s]  Impact.
[11933.92s -> 11934.80s]  Plus two tackle.
[11934.80s -> 11935.92s]  Plus two break tackle.
[11936.64s -> 11937.44s]  Plus two hands.
[11937.44s -> 11938.32s]  Plus two speed.
[11940.98s -> 11941.38s]  All right.
[11941.38s -> 11941.78s]  Cool.
[11941.78s -> 11943.06s]  Exclusive sponsor equipment.
[11945.03s -> 11945.59s]  Upgrades.
[11947.97s -> 11948.37s]  Hands.
[11948.93s -> 11949.57s]  280.
[11949.57s -> 11950.29s]  I don't have enough money.
[11950.29s -> 11951.09s]  Damn it.
[11951.09s -> 11958.36s]  Do I just hold on to the money?
[11961.60s -> 11962.16s]  What can I do?
[11964.15s -> 11965.11s]  I can do blocking.
[11966.23s -> 11966.87s]  Probably need it.
[11968.98s -> 11969.94s]  Resist injury.
[11970.76s -> 11973.24s]  Turbo jets inside of the massage pool.
[11973.88s -> 11979.09s]  Agility maybe.
[11981.97s -> 11984.58s]  I'm going to hold on to the money.
[11988.23s -> 11989.19s]  Agility block.
[11989.19s -> 11990.23s]  I need no block.
[11992.58s -> 11992.90s]  Yeah.
[11992.90s -> 11993.70s]  Get everything to one.
[11993.70s -> 11994.50s]  That's not a bad idea.
[11996.04s -> 11996.60s]  What about drugs?
[11996.60s -> 11997.88s]  What can I take for drugs?
[11997.88s -> 11998.44s]  Okay.
[11998.44s -> 11999.96s]  I just accidentally took them.
[11999.96s -> 12000.76s]  I don't even know what they are.
[12001.72s -> 12002.28s]  What are those?
[12002.92s -> 12003.48s]  I don't know.
[12005.57s -> 12008.13s]  I just took a handful of random drugs and I don't know what they do.
[12008.77s -> 12013.88s]  Okay.
[12017.06s -> 12017.78s]  5-0.
[12017.78s -> 12020.26s]  I got five grand versus Cincinnati Crusaders.
[12023.35s -> 12024.10s]  I don't know.
[12024.10s -> 12028.45s]  After that last one, I can't believe I got to get my shit together, right?
[12029.57s -> 12032.21s]  Let me take a piss and grab another Coke.
[12032.21s -> 12042.60s]  I'll be right back.
[12042.60s -> 12043.48s]  Everyone says again.
[12044.04s -> 12044.60s]  Yeah.
[12044.60s -> 12047.16s]  I slammed that last Coke and now I got to pee it out.
[12047.88s -> 12183.22s]  I just realized something.
[12184.58s -> 12186.77s]  Holy shit.
[12186.77s -> 12188.45s]  Is it a good time to be a Boston sports fan?
[12189.17s -> 12190.69s]  The Red Sox just won the World Series.
[12191.25s -> 12194.44s]  Patriots just won the Super Bowl.
[12194.44s -> 12194.84s]  Wow.
[12194.84s -> 12196.52s]  I just realized that right now.
[12201.35s -> 12202.15s]  Let me know you didn't.
[12206.53s -> 12209.33s]  Well, I mean, what am I just realizing this yet?
[12209.33s -> 12213.17s]  Because the Patriots just like 40 minutes ago won the Super Bowl.
[12213.17s -> 12217.41s]  It's better to be a Las Vegas fan.
[12217.41s -> 12217.97s]  Well, not yet.
[12218.92s -> 12219.32s]  Not yet.
[12224.07s -> 12225.59s]  Not till like 2020.
[12225.59s -> 12229.00s]  But let's go.
[12229.00s -> 12230.12s]  The Cincinnati Crusaders.
[12232.76s -> 12236.55s]  Oh, must mean by more than 15 points.
[12236.55s -> 12237.19s]  I don't even have any.
[12237.19s -> 12237.99s]  No, no bet.
[12237.99s -> 12239.03s]  I don't have any fucking money.
[12239.03s -> 12239.83s]  This team's terrible.
[12240.55s -> 12241.27s]  They're one in four.
[12241.91s -> 12244.56s]  You're going to go up against the Las Vegas.
[12246.29s -> 12247.25s]  What's the team name?
[12247.25s -> 12247.75s]  I forget.
[12248.71s -> 12251.75s]  We're playing the Cincinnati Crusaders this week.
[12251.75s -> 12252.63s]  Hallelujah.
[12254.17s -> 12257.37s]  Their best player by far is free safety Ezekiel Freeman.
[12259.77s -> 12262.60s]  Ezekiel could be playing division one ball,
[12262.60s -> 12265.00s]  but he claims God told him to be a Crusader.
[12266.76s -> 12269.08s]  Come Sunday morning, he's reveling in the good book.
[12269.64s -> 12271.88s]  Sunday afternoon, he raises hell.
[12275.27s -> 12275.59s]  Okay.
[12276.63s -> 12277.43s]  So he's a safety.
[12283.59s -> 12284.87s]  Are you waiting for the Raiders?
[12287.10s -> 12288.30s]  No, not particularly.
[12289.10s -> 12290.54s]  That's going to be really interesting.
[12291.26s -> 12301.80s]  But I'm more of a baseball fan than I am a football fan.
[12301.80s -> 12306.92s]  So if Las Vegas gets itself a Las Vegas baseball team,
[12307.48s -> 12309.16s]  I'll be very, very excited.
[12309.16s -> 12311.99s]  All right, I have to make a 50 yard play.
[12311.99s -> 12322.62s]  That'll count for 50 yards.
[12322.62s -> 12323.02s]  I think.
[12323.02s -> 12323.74s]  Oh, there he is.
[12323.74s -> 12325.50s]  The Crusader himself.
[12325.50s -> 12326.46s]  Just shut it down.
[12326.46s -> 12327.50s]  God, come on.
[12328.14s -> 12331.66s]  He was a lightning bolt.
[12331.66s -> 12332.70s]  That was ridiculous.
[12335.54s -> 12336.50s]  That was so fast.
[12336.74s -> 12337.30s]  Where is he?
[12337.30s -> 12337.78s]  Top left.
[12337.78s -> 12338.66s]  He's the safety over there.
[12348.20s -> 12352.42s]  Hey, I'm supposed to be down there playing this game.
[12352.42s -> 12353.70s]  I really let myself go.
[12354.42s -> 12355.46s]  What happened to me?
[12355.46s -> 12356.82s]  I got to get away from that safety.
[12356.82s -> 12357.54s]  Let's go.
[12357.54s -> 12358.34s]  Let's go with a shimmy.
[12359.06s -> 12360.02s]  Two blockers on the right.
[12360.82s -> 12361.86s]  Try to go right between them.
[12366.60s -> 12369.00s]  Well, if you were there, that would have been a great run,
[12369.00s -> 12369.64s]  but you weren't there.
[12369.64s -> 12370.76s]  He was just blocking that guy.
[12371.88s -> 12377.83s]  Let's see if I can get a hook.
[12382.46s -> 12383.98s]  He's so fast.
[12384.14s -> 12384.64s]  Got it.
[12391.98s -> 12392.78s]  Now, let's go for a run.
[12393.82s -> 12395.02s]  Shimmy, shimmy right again.
[12395.02s -> 12395.82s]  Let's go make a cross.
[12400.65s -> 12401.21s]  Oh, okay.
[12402.25s -> 12403.29s]  I was going to go for a juke.
[12403.29s -> 12403.77s]  Didn't get it.
[12405.42s -> 12405.98s]  Same deal.
[12405.98s -> 12406.78s]  Let's go right in the middle.
[12406.78s -> 12407.98s]  That wasn't very cordial.
[12410.06s -> 12411.26s]  No, right here.
[12411.98s -> 12412.78s]  Just go across.
[12413.58s -> 12417.19s]  Oh, shit.
[12417.19s -> 12418.55s]  I got stuffed.
[12419.35s -> 12420.47s]  I just got stuffed.
[12432.41s -> 12433.45s]  No two-pointer version.
[12433.45s -> 12434.41s]  Just get the field done.
[12435.13s -> 12447.56s]  As he gets Greg Caliendo in a booth
[12447.56s -> 12451.88s]  and tell him to do every John Madden stumble he's ever done.
[12453.24s -> 12458.50s]  Actual via.
[12461.08s -> 12461.56s]  Dirty hit.
[12464.63s -> 12465.35s]  All right.
[12465.35s -> 12466.15s]  Keep the defense up.
[12468.60s -> 12469.40s]  Lock it down.
[12469.40s -> 12471.16s]  He's not on offense.
[12471.16s -> 12472.44s]  So don't have to worry about it here.
[12478.44s -> 12478.94s]  Good play.
[12480.04s -> 12482.44s]  And that's the end of the first quarter
[12482.76s -> 12484.92s]  Las Vegas leads by seven.
[12484.92s -> 12486.28s]  What is that commentary?
[12488.92s -> 12489.72s]  It is very odd.
[12492.14s -> 12493.26s]  Oh, let's stay.
[12493.26s -> 12494.22s]  Let's stay back.
[12494.22s -> 12496.55s]  I feel like you're going for a pass play.
[12504.20s -> 12505.48s]  Magnetized to his back.
[12507.26s -> 12507.90s]  Third down.
[12509.40s -> 12509.88s]  You know what?
[12509.88s -> 12511.16s]  Just blitz them.
[12511.16s -> 12513.08s]  Defense will be coming here on third and long.
[12514.55s -> 12515.05s]  Get it.
[12515.93s -> 12516.43s]  Get it.
[12519.96s -> 12521.48s]  No, what a play they did to me.
[12522.28s -> 12526.78s]  Cincinnati gets some monster yardage on that play.
[12526.78s -> 12532.39s]  Defense in solid field position here inside the red zone.
[12542.73s -> 12551.24s]  There it is.
[12551.24s -> 12551.80s]  Broken neck.
[12552.44s -> 12552.92s]  What did I do?
[12554.39s -> 12555.91s]  No, he just went bent.
[12566.76s -> 12567.96s]  That was a little more than I thought.
[12569.46s -> 12571.22s]  That was a helmet to skull.
[12573.18s -> 12574.86s]  Sixth play of this drive.
[12574.86s -> 12575.36s]  Wow.
[12576.92s -> 12578.28s]  It's a neck and neck and two.
[12584.88s -> 12585.76s]  I was there.
[12586.64s -> 12587.68s]  I made the right play.
[12588.64s -> 12589.14s]  Watch this.
[12593.00s -> 12593.50s]  Huh?
[12594.86s -> 12596.70s]  Keep the arm on this young man.
[12596.70s -> 12598.30s]  Not to mention the accuracy.
[12604.16s -> 12604.66s]  Tug him.
[12604.66s -> 12605.92s]  And the extra point is good.
[12605.92s -> 12606.88s]  And that ties it up.
[12608.40s -> 12609.12s]  Jesus.
[12609.12s -> 12610.24s]  Jesus said so.
[12614.56s -> 12615.92s]  Nobody's got an unleashed meter.
[12615.92s -> 12617.90s]  So should be good.
[12618.62s -> 12624.29s]  Mistake.
[12625.15s -> 12627.48s]  But still got me.
[12629.87s -> 12630.83s]  Son of a bitch.
[12639.10s -> 12639.82s]  Out of the way.
[12640.94s -> 12641.98s]  Just make it there.
[12641.98s -> 12642.54s]  You got it.
[12643.34s -> 12644.30s]  Don't do any taunting.
[12645.02s -> 12646.19s]  Just get it.
[12646.19s -> 12652.28s]  I think it's gonna be codes.
[12652.28s -> 12655.56s]  I think he's got insurance.
[12655.56s -> 12656.06s]  I'm not.
[12656.84s -> 12657.48s]  Just get it.
[12658.04s -> 12658.54s]  Stay ahead.
[12663.68s -> 12664.24s]  Blocked it.
[12664.24s -> 12665.28s]  And the extra point is good.
[12666.00s -> 12666.97s]  Is that a new sponsor?
[12666.97s -> 12667.77s]  Did I get the 50 yards?
[12668.49s -> 12670.86s]  I think I did, right?
[12671.50s -> 12684.84s]  He's gonna have a meter in a second.
[12685.95s -> 12686.67s]  So am I though.
[12690.06s -> 12691.02s]  That this guy's back in the game?
[12698.43s -> 12700.91s]  Oh, don't let him in there.
[12700.91s -> 12701.55s]  Knock him down.
[12703.88s -> 12705.08s]  See an ankle.
[12705.08s -> 12710.56s]  Oh, the fluid.
[12711.20s -> 12712.56s]  That frog fin.
[12715.29s -> 12716.49s]  That was a frog.
[12716.49s -> 12717.45s]  That wasn't even a person.
[12720.73s -> 12721.85s]  And that wasn't even an unleash.
[12721.85s -> 12722.49s]  I still have one.
[12732.01s -> 12732.97s]  Intercept him.
[12732.97s -> 12733.53s]  Perfect.
[12733.53s -> 12734.09s]  Turn it around.
[12734.09s -> 12734.49s]  Watch this.
[12735.13s -> 12735.63s]  Bingo.
[12736.33s -> 12742.22s]  Still have an unleash.
[12747.69s -> 12749.13s]  I still have an unleash.
[12749.13s -> 12749.93s]  I'm not gonna use it.
[12757.45s -> 12774.17s]  Nothing here.
[12776.09s -> 12778.78s]  The guy, I didn't want to throw it a square.
[12778.78s -> 12784.96s]  It was like, what the fuck?
[12784.96s -> 12785.44s]  Oh well.
[12785.44s -> 12785.84s]  It's okay.
[12785.84s -> 12786.40s]  It's still up.
[12786.40s -> 12787.52s]  I still have an unleash.
[12787.52s -> 12788.48s]  I'll get it back right now.
[12791.74s -> 12794.36s]  Give me that ball back.
[12795.56s -> 12803.84s]  I'm running the clock out.
[12816.68s -> 12818.89s]  Watch this guy on the left.
[12818.89s -> 12819.77s]  This guy's coming up.
[12820.73s -> 12823.50s]  How many does it take?
[12824.22s -> 12825.50s]  You're gonna have to do a timeout.
[12826.14s -> 12827.32s]  I don't see a timeout.
[12827.32s -> 12828.20s]  Do you have any timeouts?
[12828.84s -> 12829.32s]  I'll take it.
[12830.12s -> 12831.00s]  One second.
[12831.00s -> 12831.72s]  Give me a break.
[12834.57s -> 12836.33s]  And with the first half of the books,
[12836.33s -> 12838.25s]  Las Vegas leads by seven.
[12838.25s -> 12840.89s]  Why would you not do a timeout here?
[12840.89s -> 12842.38s]  Did they not have any timeouts?
[12843.74s -> 12848.32s]  Oh, you just gave yourself worse position with the ball.
[12850.54s -> 12852.68s]  Unless he activates his thing.
[12854.20s -> 12855.00s]  Which he just did.
[12855.00s -> 12855.88s]  Okay, this is not good.
[12857.40s -> 12862.19s]  That's a fumble, isn't it?
[12868.62s -> 12872.68s]  All right, I thought he fumbled it.
[12872.68s -> 12873.24s]  Apparently not.
[12874.75s -> 12875.95s]  First and 30.
[12875.95s -> 12876.75s]  This is not good.
[12876.75s -> 12877.71s]  They're gonna get it.
[12877.71s -> 12879.55s]  Unless I can get an interception or something or a good hit.
[12881.55s -> 12883.79s]  That was pretty good.
[12889.02s -> 12890.86s]  Building meter slowly.
[12891.66s -> 12896.97s]  Please don't hurt them.
[12897.53s -> 12898.33s]  Oh, I'm not hurting them.
[12898.33s -> 12898.65s]  They are.
[12905.29s -> 12905.77s]  How did you?
[12906.49s -> 12907.29s]  How did you?
[12907.29s -> 12908.49s]  He was right to you.
[12909.61s -> 12910.65s]  Get some more lotion ordered.
[12910.65s -> 12912.01s]  I'm doing hands no matter how much it is next.
[12913.23s -> 12915.05s]  Third and let's just call it third.
[12915.05s -> 12917.77s]  We're putting into a vigorous hand training.
[12918.89s -> 12920.06s]  Where's it going?
[12926.80s -> 12928.80s]  It's just salmon jumping out of water.
[12929.84s -> 12932.86s]  They gotta kick a field goal.
[12935.05s -> 12941.39s]  They're going for a field goal right now.
[12942.03s -> 12942.51s]  I'll take it.
[12942.51s -> 12943.15s]  I'm still ahead.
[12944.96s -> 12946.41s]  Oh, shit.
[12946.41s -> 12947.13s]  Did I get it?
[12947.13s -> 12948.57s]  The field goal is good.
[12948.57s -> 12950.25s]  They're chipping away at the lead.
[12950.25s -> 12951.77s]  Can they come all the way back?
[12954.59s -> 12955.71s]  God, fuck.
[12955.71s -> 12962.73s]  All right, don't burn it.
[12965.53s -> 12967.87s]  He let go.
[12968.83s -> 12969.63s]  He had it up to him.
[12975.76s -> 12978.19s]  Let's go for a run to the left here.
[13000.17s -> 13001.37s]  What a catch that was.
[13011.21s -> 13013.37s]  That reception all the way into the end zone.
[13013.37s -> 13014.73s]  Nice yards after the catch.
[13016.25s -> 13018.48s]  I'm going for it.
[13026.41s -> 13027.37s]  Knees that bad.
[13027.37s -> 13028.73s]  The conversion is good.
[13028.73s -> 13029.53s]  Now the game's out of reach.
[13030.57s -> 13032.67s]  They never win.
[13032.67s -> 13048.70s]  22.
[13049.48s -> 13051.10s]  What do I have to win by?
[13051.10s -> 13051.98s]  No, I didn't make any bets.
[13055.07s -> 13055.55s]  Deep zones.
[13055.55s -> 13057.31s]  The offense looking at first and 30.
[13059.32s -> 13060.20s]  The Super Bowlers.
[13060.20s -> 13061.72s]  They're about to win the Super Bowl.
[13061.72s -> 13062.36s]  Normal bowl.
[13066.94s -> 13067.82s]  That was a big hit.
[13068.38s -> 13069.34s]  10% stamina.
[13070.06s -> 13071.24s]  Back off, bitch.
[13072.44s -> 13075.72s]  That was a good counter.
[13077.85s -> 13078.73s]  The normal bowl.
[13081.88s -> 13082.76s]  Let's do some jamming.
[13085.07s -> 13086.03s]  Watch this right side.
[13086.91s -> 13090.41s]  Las Vegas.
[13090.41s -> 13090.91s]  What?
[13091.93s -> 13094.41s]  Did I just scoop slam somebody and they dropped the ball?
[13095.45s -> 13098.96s]  Quite trailing late in the game and giving it up.
[13100.96s -> 13101.84s]  I need to see that again.
[13101.84s -> 13102.48s]  What happened here?
[13103.20s -> 13105.29s]  So he's he backs up.
[13108.17s -> 13112.48s]  Okay, so he just kind of flicks the ball
[13113.28s -> 13114.80s]  from his left hand.
[13114.80s -> 13116.32s]  I was supposed to go to the guy right in the middle
[13116.32s -> 13118.96s]  and I'm in the middle of doing like a slam to some guy.
[13118.96s -> 13119.76s]  That, what a hero.
[13121.04s -> 13123.68s]  Not only does he belly to back soup like somebody,
[13124.24s -> 13125.44s]  he also recovers the football.
[13129.76s -> 13130.26s]  Nice job.
[13133.08s -> 13133.58s]  QB.
[13144.75s -> 13145.25s]  That was quick.
[13145.95s -> 13147.26s]  Trick play.
[13148.22s -> 13149.36s]  Look at this one.
[13149.36s -> 13150.48s]  Check this out.
[13150.48s -> 13151.60s]  This is going to be all over the place.
[13158.75s -> 13165.23s]  That was perfectly executed.
[13172.51s -> 13175.15s]  Even Crusader guy couldn't stop me.
[13179.74s -> 13182.72s]  Is he alive?
[13184.32s -> 13185.44s]  He actually got up.
[13185.44s -> 13186.24s]  I'm very surprised.
[13191.29s -> 13194.17s]  Cincinnati needs to make this a scoring drive.
[13196.30s -> 13197.34s]  They are one and four.
[13198.38s -> 13200.72s]  Looks like a fumble.
[13200.72s -> 13202.80s]  Las Vegas comes up with the turnover.
[13203.52s -> 13204.48s]  Oh, I was trying to shoot him.
[13204.48s -> 13206.16s]  These fellows may have just seen their chances
[13206.16s -> 13208.00s]  of winning fly out the window.
[13208.00s -> 13209.84s]  And so with three quarters gone,
[13209.84s -> 13211.92s]  Las Vegas leads by 20.
[13215.16s -> 13216.44s]  Hey, that is bullshit.
[13217.48s -> 13225.26s]  I got a play for you, buddy.
[13225.26s -> 13226.06s]  Under pressure.
[13227.50s -> 13228.62s]  And it's intercepted.
[13228.62s -> 13232.94s]  Ezekiel Freeman is hard to stop once the QB's in his sights.
[13232.94s -> 13234.70s]  He does that game in and game out.
[13234.70s -> 13236.14s]  Just consistent, great play.
[13236.78s -> 13237.26s]  Why pass?
[13249.32s -> 13251.00s]  Passing on first and goal.
[13252.12s -> 13253.00s]  I was going to run,
[13253.00s -> 13254.76s]  but then I got scared because he had an unleash
[13254.76s -> 13256.36s]  and I was scared he was going to hurt my quarterback,
[13256.36s -> 13258.60s]  which is the main player of the campaign.
[13258.60s -> 13260.20s]  And I thought I was going to be up for like five games
[13260.20s -> 13261.56s]  and then I had panicked.
[13261.56s -> 13262.04s]  I panicked.
[13262.04s -> 13276.06s]  Oh, it was right.
[13276.06s -> 13276.56s]  Get them.
[13277.50s -> 13280.28s]  What shitty hands.
[13282.89s -> 13284.57s]  Get a punt.
[13284.57s -> 13286.33s]  The receiver couldn't hang on to it.
[13286.33s -> 13286.97s]  You have to punt.
[13291.08s -> 13291.72s]  Fuck, how did I?
[13291.72s -> 13300.27s]  I thought I had the guy back there to receive the punt.
[13300.27s -> 13301.47s]  The 34 yard line.
[13301.47s -> 13303.55s]  And so they're forced to turn the ball over.
[13303.55s -> 13305.95s]  The offense not able to move the sticks this time.
[13309.56s -> 13311.40s]  First down, 30 yards to go.
[13311.48s -> 13313.56s]  Ball spotted at the 34 yard line.
[13316.86s -> 13317.34s]  Touchdown.
[13317.34s -> 13318.14s]  Thanks a lot.
[13318.14s -> 13318.86s]  Good job, Robbie.
[13320.62s -> 13321.12s]  Robbie.
[13324.24s -> 13325.84s]  A really outstanding run.
[13325.84s -> 13328.40s]  He blew past defenders and found some room to run.
[13329.45s -> 13330.09s]  Excellent work.
[13331.48s -> 13332.04s]  Robbie's good.
[13332.68s -> 13337.04s]  Let's take the field going.
[13337.04s -> 13338.00s]  No, we're so far ahead.
[13338.00s -> 13338.50s]  Who cares?
[13339.96s -> 13341.08s]  No, I don't want to.
[13341.08s -> 13341.64s]  What are you doing?
[13342.44s -> 13343.61s]  I'm getting booed.
[13344.25s -> 13344.75s]  Whatever.
[13345.21s -> 13349.24s]  The extra point is good.
[13349.96s -> 13351.61s]  Is Robbie juicing?
[13352.41s -> 13354.41s]  I don't think Robbie's on drugs this game.
[13355.45s -> 13356.65s]  He was on drugs last game.
[13357.21s -> 13363.96s]  Let's go for an injury.
[13372.99s -> 13374.19s]  How's the ribs?
[13374.19s -> 13374.91s]  How do those feel?
[13376.51s -> 13377.60s]  Here we go.
[13377.60s -> 13378.08s]  Here we go.
[13379.28s -> 13379.76s]  Hold on, man.
[13379.76s -> 13380.40s]  I'll give you a hand.
[13380.40s -> 13380.90s]  Come on.
[13382.16s -> 13384.92s]  You actually want to buy this?
[13384.92s -> 13385.64s]  I don't blame you.
[13386.28s -> 13390.20s]  It's a very, it's a very fun game regardless if it's a football game.
[13392.38s -> 13402.65s]  One of those franchises that kind of disappeared.
[13409.87s -> 13412.83s]  Because they did Blitz, Blitz the League, the Blitz 2.
[13412.83s -> 13413.95s]  It was in the arcades too.
[13413.95s -> 13416.83s]  Not this, but I remember Blitz being in the arcade.
[13424.19s -> 13430.03s]  I would love another Blitz from Midway, which then, which now turned into Netherrealm, right?
[13430.91s -> 13431.95s]  Or are they different companies?
[13431.95s -> 13432.45s]  No.
[13446.65s -> 13448.49s]  Owned by, does he own it?
[13449.53s -> 13456.46s]  I would love them to take a year off Mortal Kombat.
[13457.18s -> 13459.90s]  Okay, our new mantra is run the ball, burn the clock.
[13459.90s -> 13463.82s]  And make, well not a year, I mean like instead of a new Mortal Kombat cycle,
[13463.82s -> 13467.90s]  which is about 24 years sometimes, two years, that's wide open.
[13467.90s -> 13471.66s]  Looking for the big play and it's complete at the 30-yard line.
[13471.66s -> 13472.86s]  The ball comes loose.
[13472.86s -> 13477.26s]  Cincinnati makes the recovery and that hit drops him like a rock.
[13479.29s -> 13480.33s]  Every two years?
[13480.33s -> 13480.83s]  Yeah.
[13482.33s -> 13485.13s]  So they took a break from Mortal Kombat and made another Blitz.
[13485.93s -> 13487.45s]  Good, you good to go?
[13490.24s -> 13492.32s]  There was some great arcade sports games.
[13492.96s -> 13494.40s]  I don't like the simulation games.
[13496.57s -> 13497.89s]  Get up.
[13498.67s -> 13500.09s]  Don't let them have this.
[13504.88s -> 13508.40s]  Never gonna happen.
[13509.12s -> 13510.88s]  Yeah, there was the bigs, there was Blitz.
[13511.92s -> 13513.92s]  NBA Street was another amazing game.
[13514.88s -> 13518.00s]  Why do they only make these simulation games now?
[13518.00s -> 13520.40s]  What happened to the fun arcade sports games?
[13522.92s -> 13524.73s]  Wait, has anybody made one?
[13525.37s -> 13529.74s]  The receiver never had a chance.
[13529.74s -> 13531.74s]  He got pummeled before the ball arrived.
[13533.50s -> 13534.30s]  Because of the licensing?
[13534.30s -> 13535.90s]  Well, there's no license for this game at all.
[13537.88s -> 13538.76s]  There's no NFL teams.
[13538.76s -> 13539.48s]  There's no license here.
[13539.48s -> 13540.36s]  These are all made up teams.
[13548.12s -> 13550.28s]  Or should I say the defender got there early.
[13550.28s -> 13551.56s]  Big fourth down coming up.
[13552.76s -> 13554.56s]  They're not going to do it, are they?
[13554.56s -> 13555.76s]  We need to shut them down.
[13556.40s -> 13558.33s]  Nah, they are going for it.
[13561.82s -> 13564.30s]  NBA Street volume two is the best sports game ever made.
[13565.10s -> 13566.30s]  I might agree with you on that.
[13566.30s -> 13567.58s]  Feeling the rush.
[13568.38s -> 13569.63s]  Incomplete.
[13569.63s -> 13573.15s]  The quarterback needs to make sure his throw gets there before the defender, I think.
[13573.15s -> 13574.35s]  That's fairly accurate.
[13575.39s -> 13577.13s]  That's a turnover.
[13579.13s -> 13580.73s]  First down, 30 yards to go.
[13581.93s -> 13582.49s]  Blood Bowl.
[13586.97s -> 13587.85s]  Eaves it deep.
[13590.24s -> 13591.36s]  Oh no, please don't catch that.
[13592.08s -> 13594.40s]  And the defender says nothing doing.
[13594.40s -> 13597.04s]  And so, Las Vegas will take this one.
[13597.04s -> 13599.60s]  Oh, I didn't even do any timeouts.
[13599.60s -> 13600.24s]  It doesn't matter.
[13600.24s -> 13600.88s]  I went by a lot.
[13601.84s -> 13603.92s]  Mario Strikers was a great soccer game.
[13604.72s -> 13605.22s]  It was.
[13606.96s -> 13611.12s]  All these games lived in like the PlayStation 3 Wii era.
[13612.16s -> 13613.28s]  PS2, PS3.
[13613.28s -> 13614.72s]  Why has there been no none?
[13616.00s -> 13620.14s]  Next Gen has so much opportunity to make one of those.
[13620.14s -> 13621.26s]  And make them way better.
[13622.59s -> 13623.71s]  A new NBA Street.
[13624.43s -> 13628.04s]  Look at like the technology increases and the amount of things.
[13628.04s -> 13629.00s]  It'd be so much better.
[13629.72s -> 13631.20s]  Slogfest was awesome.
[13631.84s -> 13638.24s]  All right, we're going to get a cut scene.
[13640.48s -> 13641.92s]  Nice game you played today, kid.
[13642.56s -> 13642.96s]  Nice.
[13643.84s -> 13645.12s]  It was fucking awesome.
[13646.16s -> 13655.40s]  Sure thing, beautiful.
[13655.40s -> 13656.84s]  Where would you like for me to stand?
[13657.88s -> 13660.52s]  Don't undo it.
[13660.52s -> 13661.80s]  Hey, hold this, partner.
[13663.32s -> 13664.60s]  Hey, I want one too.
[13664.60s -> 13665.40s]  She a wraith.
[13668.44s -> 13672.89s]  Uh-oh, here comes the jealousy arc.
[13673.77s -> 13676.57s]  Oh, franchise, you're unstoppable.
[13676.57s -> 13679.45s]  Oh yeah, you just unstoppable.
[13680.17s -> 13681.05s]  Got that right.
[13681.53s -> 13682.65s]  Un-fucking-stoppable.
[13682.65s -> 13683.15s]  What the fuck?
[13692.24s -> 13693.04s]  Did this poison me?
[13693.04s -> 13693.44s]  What was it?
[13693.44s -> 13693.94s]  What happened?
[13696.81s -> 13697.85s]  Hey there, franchise.
[13698.41s -> 13700.09s]  I've been watching you since draft day.
[13700.89s -> 13702.89s]  You're good, but I can do things for you.
[13702.89s -> 13704.89s]  Your coaches and trainers can't.
[13704.89s -> 13706.41s]  Ask around in the locker room.
[13706.41s -> 13707.37s]  They'll know who I am.
[13708.73s -> 13710.97s]  Keep that body of yours healthy and I'll be in touch.
[13712.01s -> 13713.21s]  I can do things for you, okay?
[13713.21s -> 13714.17s]  Ask around in the locker room.
[13714.17s -> 13714.81s]  They'll know who I am.
[13714.81s -> 13715.37s]  Keep that.
[13715.37s -> 13715.87s]  All right.
[13716.89s -> 13718.41s]  What did I tell everyone?
[13718.41s -> 13721.85s]  I told them all that my main man delivers.
[13721.85s -> 13723.85s]  That was beautiful, franchise.
[13723.85s -> 13725.85s]  You and me, we're going to conquer the world.
[13727.32s -> 13728.36s]  Don't cheat on Kim.
[13729.32s -> 13729.96s]  I'm not gonna.
[13735.39s -> 13737.15s]  See, Kim's the only girlfriend.
[13738.46s -> 13739.34s]  New sponsor stuff.
[13739.98s -> 13740.62s]  Crazy grip.
[13741.18s -> 13742.36s]  Superior ball control.
[13742.36s -> 13743.24s]  I need more hands.
[13743.24s -> 13744.20s]  I told you that's what we're going to do.
[13745.16s -> 13746.04s]  First things first.
[13746.84s -> 13749.10s]  Take my 276, go to hands.
[13759.42s -> 13761.98s]  Passing, I could make my passing better break.
[13761.98s -> 13767.85s]  Tackle, break tackle.
[13769.72s -> 13770.92s]  That means I just have to make more money.
[13771.90s -> 13775.10s]  I got to make $250, $260,000 right now.
[13777.93s -> 13778.65s]  Is there another image?
[13785.95s -> 13789.04s]  What the hell?
[13789.04s -> 13789.76s]  That's amazing.
[13790.64s -> 13790.88s]  All right.
[13790.88s -> 13792.96s]  So we got training and everything's fine.
[13794.27s -> 13794.75s]  Juicing.
[13795.71s -> 13797.45s]  Let's go.
[13797.45s -> 13797.85s]  What do I got?
[13797.85s -> 13804.40s]  20,000 class drain by statement of loss to opponents.
[13805.58s -> 13806.06s]  No, no, no.
[13806.54s -> 13809.26s]  I want to give this to somebody on defense.
[13809.98s -> 13817.15s]  I mean, I am on defense, but do I get this on?
[13817.95s -> 13819.47s]  I get it on defense too, right?
[13824.14s -> 13827.02s]  Because I need to make tackles with myself.
[13827.02s -> 13829.66s]  Let's give Robbie something.
[13832.38s -> 13837.82s]  Reduce the chance of severity of injury sustained or stamina loss from tackles.
[13837.82s -> 13838.46s]  Let's go for it.
[13843.00s -> 13843.24s]  All right.
[13843.24s -> 13845.56s]  This is against the Cleveland Steamers.
[13846.65s -> 13849.40s]  Currently 6-0.
[13849.40s -> 13849.80s]  We are.
[13857.36s -> 13862.09s]  We have increased our stats here pretty even.
[13862.09s -> 13863.53s]  Besides, I got a little bit better defense.
[13864.17s -> 13865.77s]  Got to win by more than 23 points.
[13865.77s -> 13867.37s]  I don't have any money, so don't bet at all.
[13867.37s -> 13869.58s]  Why 6-0?
[13869.58s -> 13870.38s]  Can we make it 7-0?
[13872.64s -> 13875.20s]  We play the Cleveland Steamers on Sunday.
[13875.20s -> 13879.36s]  The best player they've got is wide receiver extraordinaire, Henry Cho.
[13879.36s -> 13882.00s]  Cho is like the bad guy in a Hong Kong action movie.
[13883.04s -> 13887.50s]  Hong Kong action moves off video too.
[13888.32s -> 13892.68s]  Cho's got style, but he has one problem.
[13893.08s -> 13894.92s]  Half the team is doing his wire.
[13895.72s -> 13896.04s]  What?
[13901.60s -> 13902.64s]  That's how you're going to end that?
[13903.88s -> 13904.20s]  Okay.
[13905.68s -> 13907.52s]  So wide receiver, a good thing I'm a safety.
[13908.40s -> 13924.20s]  Because obviously, you know, I can cover big play secondary and there's bad pass consistency.
[13924.84s -> 13930.49s]  Good evening and welcome.
[13930.49s -> 13932.89s]  Well, we all know what's at stake here for this team.
[13932.89s -> 13936.25s]  Another win and they're going to the division three championship.
[13936.25s -> 13937.21s]  Both teams are ready.
[13937.21s -> 13937.77s]  That's right.
[13937.77s -> 13938.65s]  Championship.
[13938.65s -> 13948.43s]  I got a championship incoming here on his head.
[13950.03s -> 13953.39s]  Right off the bat.
[13954.03s -> 13954.51s]  Two clips.
[13954.51s -> 13954.75s]  Good.
[13955.88s -> 13956.20s]  All right.
[13956.20s -> 13957.72s]  So I need to cover.
[13959.55s -> 13961.95s]  Where is that receiver?
[13961.95s -> 13962.75s]  Wide receiver, right?
[13963.63s -> 13966.20s]  I cannot let him catch a pass.
[13966.20s -> 13966.68s]  That's him.
[13969.72s -> 13970.76s]  Pretty worthless enough.
[13971.64s -> 13978.56s]  There you go.
[13979.60s -> 13980.00s]  I got you.
[13980.00s -> 13980.48s]  I got you.
[13980.48s -> 13981.28s]  You don't think I'd see you?
[13987.40s -> 13988.28s]  Don't even give him a chance.
[13991.87s -> 13992.51s]  I know.
[13992.51s -> 13993.07s]  Shut up.
[13996.28s -> 13996.84s]  Thunderstorm.
[14001.95s -> 14002.27s]  Nothing.
[14002.27s -> 14005.55s]  That could have been a big play if the ball would have gotten to him before the defender.
[14006.59s -> 14007.15s]  Here comes the punt.
[14008.35s -> 14010.33s]  I get the ball.
[14010.97s -> 14013.32s]  Why does your team look like bubblegum?
[14013.32s -> 14015.48s]  Because I tried to make it my stupid colors.
[14017.00s -> 14020.20s]  It looks awful on the home and the away jersey.
[14020.20s -> 14021.32s]  It looks bad everywhere.
[14023.39s -> 14023.63s]  What?
[14023.63s -> 14027.80s]  Did he go through?
[14027.80s -> 14028.36s]  That's weird.
[14029.40s -> 14030.36s]  All right.
[14030.36s -> 14032.52s]  So he is not on the field anymore.
[14038.86s -> 14039.74s]  Pumping into each other.
[14041.66s -> 14042.46s]  Don't please.
[14042.46s -> 14043.02s]  Don't catch it.
[14043.66s -> 14044.14s]  No.
[14044.14s -> 14045.90s]  What the fuck did I do?
[14045.90s -> 14047.18s]  How is that such a bad throw?
[14050.04s -> 14050.52s]  Calm down.
[14054.25s -> 14054.89s]  No.
[14054.89s -> 14055.69s]  What the heck did I do?
[14056.65s -> 14062.59s]  Really?
[14065.23s -> 14074.68s]  Look at that play they just did to me.
[14085.13s -> 14085.77s]  Thank God.
[14087.53s -> 14089.05s]  He just sniffed on two people.
[14089.05s -> 14089.61s]  That's the guy.
[14090.57s -> 14093.44s]  Crucial series of downs here.
[14093.44s -> 14094.48s]  Thankfully somebody caught him.
[14105.42s -> 14106.62s]  Stamina has been decreased.
[14106.62s -> 14107.10s]  He's at 80%.
[14108.30s -> 14111.52s]  I had my target.
[14112.24s -> 14113.12s]  I picked the target.
[14116.11s -> 14117.55s]  It's time to put him up for good.
[14129.40s -> 14129.88s]  Put him out.
[14133.50s -> 14134.06s]  Put him out.
[14139.08s -> 14139.72s]  Third and goal.
[14140.52s -> 14150.33s]  Not the fourth down.
[14150.33s -> 14152.17s]  And he's brought down at the eight yard line.
[14152.17s -> 14153.05s]  Are you going to go for field goal?
[14155.71s -> 14156.67s]  I would assume probably.
[14158.03s -> 14158.19s]  Yeah.
[14163.58s -> 14165.10s]  And that's the end of the first quarter.
[14165.10s -> 14166.22s]  And we're scoreless.
[14167.02s -> 14171.21s]  Nice snap.
[14172.25s -> 14172.81s]  I don't know.
[14172.81s -> 14173.45s]  Goal line.
[14174.41s -> 14175.77s]  Special field goal block.
[14176.81s -> 14178.96s]  I can make it in there.
[14183.47s -> 14186.92s]  The field goal is good.
[14187.72s -> 14192.70s]  And a little more juice.
[14199.42s -> 14200.30s]  Touchdown incoming.
[14201.10s -> 14206.22s]  Blocked my unleash.
[14206.22s -> 14209.31s]  Dick.
[14209.31s -> 14215.26s]  I'm going for it.
[14216.06s -> 14219.37s]  See ya.
[14229.92s -> 14233.64s]  I had to go for that.
[14235.00s -> 14239.55s]  And I got a choke slam.
[14245.76s -> 14247.05s]  Nothing fancy.
[14247.05s -> 14258.94s]  Who gets the ball at the half?
[14259.74s -> 14268.32s]  Never in the bigs you can break the scoreboard.
[14268.32s -> 14268.88s]  Yeah.
[14268.88s -> 14269.92s]  You can do a lot of cool shit.
[14281.76s -> 14285.04s]  This is making me want to go back and play all those old.
[14285.84s -> 14286.84s]  All my old.
[14286.84s -> 14288.44s]  I mean like 10 years, 12 years.
[14288.44s -> 14289.08s]  Not that old.
[14292.68s -> 14294.96s]  Catch that.
[14296.64s -> 14297.04s]  I don't know.
[14297.04s -> 14297.76s]  That was inhuman.
[14299.12s -> 14308.99s]  No game.
[14313.23s -> 14318.12s]  Bigs didn't have a story mode.
[14318.12s -> 14319.00s]  Yeah, this is weird.
[14319.00s -> 14320.76s]  It has takes itself.
[14322.84s -> 14323.48s]  What the fuck?
[14325.80s -> 14328.04s]  I would have had it too if I wasn't trying to get a sack.
[14328.04s -> 14330.84s]  An opening in the defense for some real yardage on that play.
[14330.84s -> 14332.52s]  Big series of downs upcoming.
[14333.40s -> 14334.52s]  I thought I could have sacked him.
[14334.52s -> 14335.16s]  It was a risk.
[14337.24s -> 14347.47s]  Okay.
[14348.59s -> 14349.31s]  Second and goal.
[14363.56s -> 14368.41s]  I'm going to stay hydrated.
[14368.41s -> 14368.73s]  I agree.
[14369.85s -> 14373.77s]  Drink one glass of water per eight ounces of activity.
[14374.41s -> 14376.16s]  Third down.
[14386.28s -> 14386.78s]  Got it.
[14388.20s -> 14388.70s]  What?
[14409.63s -> 14410.67s]  That was insane.
[14413.29s -> 14414.91s]  I can't fucking believe that.
[14419.98s -> 14420.70s]  Tackled him.
[14420.70s -> 14423.74s]  He fumbled the ball to a teammate that was standing in the end zone.
[14424.86s -> 14426.52s]  Sorry, I was still in the game.
[14427.32s -> 14428.20s]  I got timeouts.
[14428.92s -> 14432.51s]  Nobody just decides to go get that.
[14434.59s -> 14439.95s]  That was a waste of an unleash because it didn't do anything.
[14452.80s -> 14454.56s]  Oh, eat shit video game.
[14462.17s -> 14462.97s]  Big play.
[14463.93s -> 14465.05s]  Field goal.
[14465.05s -> 14465.77s]  Field goal.
[14465.77s -> 14466.41s]  Just stay ahead.
[14479.85s -> 14481.21s]  The steamers eat shit.
[14482.01s -> 14482.97s]  We'll have one attempt here.
[14484.57s -> 14486.17s]  They don't have an unleash, do they?
[14486.17s -> 14486.67s]  No.
[14487.13s -> 14488.09s]  They have nothing actually.
[14488.09s -> 14488.89s]  They're not going to get anywhere.
[14490.17s -> 14491.61s]  That'd be a good injury opportunity.
[14492.49s -> 14496.41s]  I got like one or two plays.
[14499.42s -> 14501.26s]  Just watch that receiver.
[14501.26s -> 14501.90s]  Double coverage.
[14502.46s -> 14503.42s]  Don't let him get anywhere.
[14513.95s -> 14515.31s]  Robbie is my MVP.
[14515.31s -> 14515.81s]  Yeah.
[14517.07s -> 14518.27s]  I can see that.
[14523.68s -> 14524.00s]  All right.
[14524.00s -> 14524.88s]  No, I'm staying back.
[14525.84s -> 14527.37s]  Then you can pass it all you want.
[14527.37s -> 14527.87s]  You got nothing here.
[14550.16s -> 14552.78s]  I fucking can't believe that shit.
[14552.78s -> 14554.78s]  What the hell happened there?
[14557.15s -> 14558.19s]  You've got to be kidding me.
[14560.19s -> 14560.75s]  What?
[14560.75s -> 14561.31s]  I want to see it.
[14561.31s -> 14561.79s]  What happened?
[14562.43s -> 14563.39s]  How did he even get that?
[14564.67s -> 14571.87s]  All right.
[14571.87s -> 14573.15s]  We're going to have to talk about this, guys.
[14573.15s -> 14574.67s]  About this stupid nudge.
[14578.11s -> 14580.43s]  Sorry, I'm not going to have that happen.
[14581.79s -> 14588.01s]  Let's go with the sizzle.
[14590.40s -> 14591.12s]  Steamers.
[14596.52s -> 14598.20s]  And the ball gets there too late.
[14598.20s -> 14600.36s]  Or should I say the defender got there early.
[14600.36s -> 14602.12s]  This screamer is steaming mad.
[14615.84s -> 14617.12s]  I'm getting really unlucky here.
[14617.12s -> 14620.56s]  All these turnovers are a main reason why these guys are losing side of this game.
[14620.56s -> 14620.96s]  Unlucky.
[14620.96s -> 14622.08s]  I got a first and goal.
[14622.08s -> 14623.36s]  It's gut check time.
[14623.36s -> 14625.04s]  Ball at the 17 yard line.
[14639.29s -> 14640.57s]  This is my house.
[14640.57s -> 14641.53s]  This is my house.
[14645.44s -> 14646.48s]  Look, I'm going to do this shit again.
[14647.12s -> 14656.27s]  Play third down.
[14660.11s -> 14660.59s]  Watch this.
[14662.11s -> 14662.91s]  Watch this shit.
[14662.91s -> 14663.23s]  You're done.
[14677.29s -> 14678.97s]  No, I'm 6 and 0 right now.
[14679.77s -> 14680.41s]  It's a fake.
[14681.21s -> 14688.12s]  That's the best possible thing that could have happened.
[14688.92s -> 14700.72s]  Choke slam.
[14703.05s -> 14703.45s]  No!
[14703.45s -> 14704.09s]  Wrong button!
[14704.09s -> 14704.49s]  Get up!
[14705.45s -> 14707.21s]  Oh, I was trying to circle.
[14707.85s -> 14709.13s]  God damn it.
[14709.13s -> 14710.41s]  I'm so angry about that.
[14711.69s -> 14712.81s]  That was a touchdown right there.
[14712.81s -> 14714.09s]  And I had to press square.
[14714.09s -> 14714.97s]  I was trying to press circle.
[14721.95s -> 14723.31s]  Las Vegas gets it back.
[14727.42s -> 14728.30s]  I'm not doing that again.
[14729.10s -> 14729.82s]  Get it to Robbie.
[14730.54s -> 14731.26s]  He knows what to do.
[14738.88s -> 14740.08s]  Get it to Robbie every time.
[14748.17s -> 14748.89s]  Same thing, Robbie.
[14748.89s -> 14749.29s]  You do it.
[14749.29s -> 14751.29s]  My friend's trying to punch an 8 here.
[14751.29s -> 14752.09s]  Robbie, same deal.
[14753.45s -> 14758.73s]  Let's get it to Robbie every time.
[14758.73s -> 14761.29s]  They're not there yet catching up.
[14761.93s -> 14767.79s]  That was a hit!
[14768.43s -> 14770.43s]  I don't see any new kids in his future.
[14771.15s -> 14771.65s]  Get in there.
[14782.03s -> 14783.55s]  What's with all the fumbles?
[14784.03s -> 14786.67s]  Oh, I so badly need to upgrade those hands.
[14787.23s -> 14788.91s]  I should have just kept the money.
[14789.71s -> 14790.75s]  I should have saved the money.
[14791.55s -> 14797.71s]  That's like the third fumble I've done in this game.
[14798.43s -> 14805.37s]  Still plenty of football.
[14810.20s -> 14811.40s]  It's because of the rain?
[14811.40s -> 14812.52s]  Yeah, but where's their fumble?
[14815.82s -> 14818.22s]  Got it.
[14818.84s -> 14820.52s]  Fucking can't be serious.
[14820.52s -> 14821.64s]  I tried to select him.
[14822.60s -> 14824.36s]  Apparently, he wasn't the closest person.
[14825.16s -> 14826.92s]  I would have selected him and pressed triangle.
[14835.47s -> 14836.51s]  Bringing his man down.
[14836.51s -> 14837.87s]  That was a questionable hit.
[14841.05s -> 14843.85s]  If I get a conversion here, then I'm on a good spot.
[14844.41s -> 14845.53s]  I can't get a first down here.
[14854.43s -> 14854.91s]  All right.
[14854.91s -> 14855.55s]  Played smart.
[14856.51s -> 14858.70s]  I was just going to do Hail Mary.
[14858.70s -> 14859.66s]  That would not be smart.
[14861.12s -> 14862.48s]  First down and 30.
[14864.08s -> 14879.47s]  Got it.
[14879.47s -> 14879.95s]  It's okay.
[14879.95s -> 14881.71s]  I got like four blips for that.
[14882.91s -> 14884.11s]  I really, really need those.
[14884.99s -> 14888.51s]  Look at that.
[14888.51s -> 14889.95s]  I almost have a full meter again.
[14889.95s -> 14893.84s]  Let's get it out of range of field goal.
[14894.64s -> 14895.36s]  Just get a field goal.
[14895.36s -> 14897.92s]  Then I got to get the ball back with my meter.
[14905.40s -> 14908.41s]  I've watched more of this today than the actual Super Bowl.
[14913.69s -> 14914.65s]  This is a pretty cool game.
[14919.58s -> 14920.78s]  Thank you for joining me.
[14920.78s -> 14924.75s]  Those of you that are in post Super Bowl mode right now.
[14924.75s -> 14925.39s]  If you've watched.
[14927.18s -> 14927.98s]  Get that fumble!
[14927.98s -> 14928.62s]  Get that fumble!
[14929.58s -> 14930.14s]  Who's got it?
[14931.18s -> 14935.82s]  Look at how far back we are though.
[14936.70s -> 14940.60s]  I got a full meter.
[14940.60s -> 14941.64s]  I'm going to get this ball back.
[14941.64s -> 14943.32s]  I'm going to go touch down right here.
[14943.32s -> 14944.36s]  Look at how far the ball is.
[14946.49s -> 14947.53s]  He has it unleashed as well.
[14948.17s -> 14951.95s]  All right.
[14951.95s -> 14953.23s]  That's a good spot to be in.
[14953.87s -> 14958.04s]  Do I let the receiver catch it and try to hurt him?
[14958.04s -> 14959.44s]  He wasted it.
[14960.72s -> 14963.26s]  Fumble.
[14968.86s -> 14969.18s]  Okay.
[14970.70s -> 14972.49s]  Unfortunate but okay.
[14974.65s -> 14975.13s]  Honda!
[14975.13s -> 14975.61s]  Honda!
[14975.61s -> 14976.01s]  Honda!
[14976.81s -> 14979.77s]  It's a big hit.
[14980.81s -> 14982.49s]  Where are my points for this?
[14983.13s -> 14984.41s]  How come I'm not getting any meter?
[14984.41s -> 14985.13s]  Those aren't dirty.
[14986.01s -> 14991.58s]  Apparently they're not dirty enough.
[14994.00s -> 14997.64s]  Fourth down.
[14997.64s -> 14998.68s]  What do you got?
[14998.68s -> 14998.92s]  One minute.
[14998.92s -> 15001.40s]  Defender made sure there was no receiver there to make the catch.
[15001.40s -> 15002.68s]  Are they going to punt or are they going to go for it?
[15005.58s -> 15005.74s]  No.
[15005.74s -> 15006.22s]  They're punting.
[15006.78s -> 15011.58s]  If I get a touchdown here the game is going to be fairly out of reach.
[15013.44s -> 15014.56s]  And then I'll be seven and up.
[15015.85s -> 15018.70s]  No meter.
[15018.70s -> 15020.46s]  So I'm just going to get a solid run here.
[15024.46s -> 15030.46s]  That is bullshit.
[15031.10s -> 15032.46s]  Oh I got to play for you buddy.
[15034.22s -> 15034.70s]  First down.
[15034.70s -> 15035.34s]  Let's get it to Robbie.
[15035.34s -> 15035.82s]  30 yards to go.
[15038.60s -> 15043.05s]  Oh no.
[15043.61s -> 15045.45s]  Okay.
[15045.45s -> 15046.25s]  It's nothing serious.
[15046.97s -> 15047.45s]  It is though.
[15055.05s -> 15055.93s]  That was really good.
[15056.81s -> 15058.09s]  Only have three plays.
[15058.09s -> 15058.89s]  Three standard hits.
[15062.57s -> 15064.17s]  This dude is out every game.
[15064.17s -> 15065.45s]  Oh no!
[15065.45s -> 15066.65s]  Please tell me that wasn't.
[15067.61s -> 15069.13s]  He gets injured every single game.
[15070.57s -> 15078.65s]  Steve is taking the time out.
[15079.53s -> 15080.83s]  Third and 13.
[15081.71s -> 15082.84s]  Hmm.
[15086.91s -> 15087.47s]  Lightning.
[15096.60s -> 15098.80s]  Bastards.
[15098.80s -> 15099.84s]  Am I in field goal range?
[15100.48s -> 15100.96s]  My three.
[15102.80s -> 15103.60s]  Field goal?
[15103.60s -> 15104.40s]  How close am I?
[15105.36s -> 15107.18s]  I can get it.
[15117.10s -> 15117.66s]  No good.
[15118.46s -> 15120.09s]  That's no good.
[15124.80s -> 15126.00s]  That was a perfect kick.
[15126.00s -> 15126.56s]  What happened?
[15128.60s -> 15136.33s]  It didn't aim.
[15136.33s -> 15138.17s]  I thought the game aims for you doesn't it?
[15140.28s -> 15141.72s]  I don't think you can even aim it can you?
[15146.94s -> 15147.50s]  Shit.
[15151.20s -> 15152.43s]  He's got an unleash.
[15152.43s -> 15153.95s]  This is not this is very very bad.
[15154.91s -> 15158.89s]  Well there was no kicking tutorial.
[15164.22s -> 15164.86s]  Come on.
[15164.86s -> 15166.46s]  He jumped over the ball.
[15167.18s -> 15168.46s]  He jumped over the ball.
[15171.82s -> 15174.06s]  This is where I put the game away right here.
[15174.06s -> 15175.10s]  I can do nothing.
[15175.10s -> 15175.98s]  Just stay in the zone.
[15175.98s -> 15176.86s]  Outside of the zone.
[15176.86s -> 15177.34s]  In the zone.
[15177.34s -> 15177.90s]  Get in the zone.
[15183.85s -> 15184.17s]  Fuck.
[15186.41s -> 15188.49s]  That was an unleash catch.
[15190.33s -> 15192.25s]  Oh bad bad bad.
[15192.25s -> 15192.73s]  Come on.
[15193.37s -> 15193.85s]  Defense.
[15198.27s -> 15199.12s]  No!
[15199.12s -> 15199.44s]  What?
[15199.44s -> 15200.32s]  How do you catch it?
[15200.96s -> 15201.92s]  How is that possible?
[15204.89s -> 15205.85s]  Right up your ass.
[15206.65s -> 15207.85s]  I was right up your ass.
[15207.85s -> 15208.57s]  I can't believe it.
[15209.37s -> 15212.28s]  Why did I just do that?
[15213.16s -> 15216.67s]  I just tipped it.
[15217.47s -> 15218.67s]  I just tipped.
[15218.67s -> 15219.87s]  I just timed up.
[15219.87s -> 15221.47s]  That's not what I wanted to do though.
[15221.47s -> 15224.62s]  So game over.
[15224.62s -> 15226.94s]  Out of bounds.
[15238.97s -> 15239.85s]  I'm fucking believable.
[15239.85s -> 15240.41s]  I gotta make this.
[15240.41s -> 15241.05s]  I gotta have it happen.
[15241.85s -> 15243.58s]  Seven.
[15243.58s -> 15243.90s]  28.
[15243.90s -> 15244.38s]  29.
[15244.38s -> 15244.70s]  30.
[15244.70s -> 15245.18s]  I just need.
[15245.98s -> 15247.47s]  I gotta run it back for a touchdown.
[15253.92s -> 15254.16s]  No.
[15254.80s -> 15255.44s]  I can't do it.
[15256.24s -> 15258.17s]  I have to run it back.
[15258.17s -> 15258.81s]  I have no meter.
[15259.45s -> 15262.17s]  I have to instantly run out of bounds.
[15272.32s -> 15272.80s]  Okay.
[15272.80s -> 15273.60s]  Okay.
[15273.60s -> 15273.92s]  All right.
[15273.92s -> 15274.80s]  Let's go.
[15274.80s -> 15275.28s]  Let's go.
[15281.64s -> 15283.48s]  I just hiccuped and almost threw up.
[15283.48s -> 15283.72s]  Okay.
[15283.72s -> 15284.20s]  Here we go.
[15297.15s -> 15298.91s]  Oh my first loss this season.
[15302.20s -> 15307.82s]  I gave them a timeout.
[15310.35s -> 15312.67s]  Hey, but my character was like poisoned, right?
[15312.67s -> 15313.95s]  So that's why he wasn't as good.
[15318.80s -> 15319.28s]  It's scripted.
[15319.28s -> 15320.88s]  I'm supposed to lose that one.
[15320.88s -> 15329.60s]  Uh-oh.
[15329.60s -> 15332.64s]  Do I answer this call?
[15337.92s -> 15339.04s]  I got the championship.
[15348.80s -> 15351.36s]  We'll put Damon in his place during this game.
[15351.36s -> 15352.08s]  Okay.
[15352.08s -> 15353.84s]  I got to land a dirty hit on Damon
[15353.84s -> 15355.20s]  during the division three championship.
[15355.20s -> 15356.16s]  This is the championship game.
[15356.16s -> 15358.97s]  I made it to the championship versus the Hunts.
[15360.44s -> 15361.16s]  All right.
[15361.16s -> 15361.56s]  I don't know.
[15361.56s -> 15363.16s]  I guess everyone's on drugs this game.
[15364.28s -> 15365.02s]  How are we doing?
[15365.66s -> 15367.39s]  Somebody's a broken neck.
[15368.03s -> 15368.43s]  All right.
[15368.43s -> 15369.87s]  I gotta take a bunch of drugs.
[15370.75s -> 15374.00s]  Regenerate two stamina each play that they're on the field.
[15374.80s -> 15375.04s]  Yep.
[15377.74s -> 15378.14s]  Robbie.
[15379.02s -> 15386.00s]  Resistant to injury and wide receiver.
[15386.56s -> 15388.67s]  Shepherd is going to take.
[15394.65s -> 15396.49s]  Removes the cooldown effect from clash.
[15397.05s -> 15400.11s]  No, you're going to take a turbo bar terrain.
[15400.83s -> 15403.29s]  Good luck, everybody.
[15403.85s -> 15408.14s]  This is the championship game.
[15408.78s -> 15415.05s]  Look at how much better of a team I am.
[15416.09s -> 15416.65s]  Max bet.
[15416.65s -> 15418.09s]  It's the fucking goddamn Super Bowl.
[15418.09s -> 15419.13s]  Win by 16 points.
[15419.13s -> 15420.49s]  I'm going to just, I'm going to crush them.
[15428.43s -> 15428.67s]  Yeah.
[15428.67s -> 15429.87s]  You can only take three drugs at a time.
[15433.61s -> 15435.13s]  I wasn't poisoned last game.
[15435.13s -> 15435.69s]  I'm ready to go.
[15436.56s -> 15437.04s]  This is it.
[15437.60s -> 15441.39s]  It's the quarterback.
[15441.39s -> 15442.99s]  I got to land a hit on the quarterback.
[15448.88s -> 15449.92s]  Only three drugs.
[15449.92s -> 15450.32s]  What is this?
[15450.32s -> 15450.80s]  Oblivion?
[15452.44s -> 15453.00s]  Hello, everybody.
[15453.00s -> 15453.96s]  I got to land a hit on Conrad Daniels.
[15453.96s -> 15457.00s]  I'm excited to bring you the division three championship game.
[15457.00s -> 15458.44s]  Now I'd like to throw it over to my colleague.
[15458.44s -> 15459.64s]  By the way, this is like the Pee-wee leagues.
[15459.64s -> 15461.64s]  I don't know about you, but I'm ready to watch the football.
[15461.64s -> 15464.36s]  I mean, guys brought in the ball and other guys trying to attack.
[15464.36s -> 15466.20s]  This is the division three Pee-wee Super Bowl.
[15466.76s -> 15471.87s]  In that case, they tried to tackle the guy.
[15471.87s -> 15472.51s]  Nice start.
[15472.51s -> 15473.01s]  8%.
[15473.87s -> 15481.96s]  Am I dropping frames?
[15482.68s -> 15484.46s]  What the hell?
[15484.46s -> 15485.34s]  Shouldn't be happening.
[15486.14s -> 15486.38s]  All right.
[15486.38s -> 15488.70s]  So this is the, it's the quarterback that I need to work on.
[15488.70s -> 15490.06s]  First down and 30.
[15490.06s -> 15491.34s]  He's a very good quarterback.
[15491.34s -> 15492.22s]  It's gonna be hard to do that.
[15492.46s -> 15497.72s]  That was a good fucking pass.
[15498.76s -> 15500.94s]  He just got him by goddamn weight.
[15502.36s -> 15502.68s]  Get him.
[15503.32s -> 15504.68s]  You're not going to actually.
[15504.68s -> 15507.48s]  Who's, who's foot is that?
[15508.12s -> 15509.32s]  Is that my foot?
[15510.20s -> 15510.52s]  What?
[15511.16s -> 15512.52s]  What happened to me?
[15513.16s -> 15513.48s]  Why?
[15533.72s -> 15535.56s]  That's unfucking believable.
[15535.56s -> 15536.12s]  He'll be back.
[15536.68s -> 15545.20s]  I lost to a poop joke.
[15545.20s -> 15549.12s]  That's so, oh, what a, what a dog shit.
[15549.12s -> 15549.92s]  That's unbelievable.
[15554.32s -> 15556.38s]  How did you do that?
[15557.10s -> 15558.94s]  His first is a straw.
[15559.74s -> 15561.66s]  Oh, I know I'm behind already.
[15562.62s -> 15564.22s]  First goddamn exchange.
[15565.50s -> 15566.86s]  I'm going to lose the championship.
[15571.34s -> 15572.30s]  Oh, what is he doing?
[15577.31s -> 15583.07s]  Oh, that was so fucking funny.
[15583.07s -> 15590.43s]  First and 30.
[15590.43s -> 15595.10s]  He lets it fly at the 12 yard line.
[15595.10s -> 15595.74s]  It's okay.
[15595.74s -> 15596.62s]  That was a beautiful play.
[15600.64s -> 15601.04s]  Red zone.
[15601.04s -> 15601.76s]  We're going to go for a run.
[15602.72s -> 15603.36s]  Power it in there.
[15603.36s -> 15605.12s]  Offense goes into their red zone package.
[15609.82s -> 15610.38s]  No, what?
[15611.82s -> 15613.82s]  Didn't I take resistant drugs?
[15614.38s -> 15616.22s]  Why is everybody getting hurt?
[15616.22s -> 15617.10s]  Shattered tibia.
[15620.30s -> 15622.38s]  Everybody took too many drugs.
[15622.46s -> 15623.26s]  Last game.
[15623.26s -> 15625.90s]  So now they're all fucked up because they're on drugs.
[15630.96s -> 15632.56s]  It's going to be a miracle if I win this game.
[15633.20s -> 15634.24s]  I don't even know what to say.
[15635.04s -> 15637.44s]  Speaking of disaster, let's might as well just do it.
[15641.40s -> 15641.88s]  Bingo.
[15642.60s -> 15643.08s]  Got it.
[15643.08s -> 15643.72s]  Pop.
[15643.72s -> 15644.12s]  I'll take it.
[15644.12s -> 15644.68s]  That's fine.
[15644.68s -> 15645.72s]  What a beautiful pass.
[15645.72s -> 15655.55s]  You see that spiral?
[15655.55s -> 15657.87s]  I can't throw a spiral for the life of me.
[15657.87s -> 15658.27s]  Nothing.
[15658.27s -> 15659.55s]  We had, we both had unleashed.
[15669.08s -> 15670.44s]  What a video game, Choi.
[15672.46s -> 15673.10s]  Come on, man.
[15673.10s -> 15674.62s]  We got to do this all day.
[15677.82s -> 15678.46s]  Okay.
[15678.46s -> 15679.18s]  Kick off.
[15679.18s -> 15679.74s]  Tie game.
[15684.49s -> 15686.36s]  It's okay.
[15686.36s -> 15686.84s]  It's fine.
[15692.57s -> 15693.05s]  Not good.
[15693.05s -> 15693.53s]  Not good.
[15693.53s -> 15694.57s]  I still got a guy in the back.
[15694.57s -> 15694.89s]  No.
[15701.50s -> 15705.24s]  Cardiff.
[15705.24s -> 15708.28s]  Why?
[15708.28s -> 15709.56s]  This is so unfair.
[15719.23s -> 15720.83s]  At what point am I going to have not enough people
[15720.83s -> 15721.55s]  to play the game?
[15728.51s -> 15730.43s]  It really might be that they're on too many drugs.
[15733.28s -> 15736.16s]  By the way, the guy in the back fell down on his own.
[15746.75s -> 15747.95s]  Dude just tripped in the snow.
[15748.84s -> 15750.12s]  This really is the Pee Wee League.
[15753.74s -> 15755.26s]  I got all my sponsor gear on too.
[15755.26s -> 15756.14s]  It's like bullshit.
[15758.24s -> 15759.72s]  I'm going to let you get that one.
[15761.77s -> 15764.01s]  I am closer to a special than he is.
[15765.13s -> 15765.37s]  All right.
[15765.37s -> 15766.01s]  Come on back in.
[15767.61s -> 15768.09s]  Good.
[15768.09s -> 15768.89s]  You good to go?
[15768.89s -> 15770.33s]  The rollback.
[15770.33s -> 15770.97s]  Whatever that is.
[15774.27s -> 15774.75s]  Throw it down.
[15775.63s -> 15779.52s]  There's no way you can catch that ball.
[15783.61s -> 15784.65s]  There within 30.
[15784.65s -> 15786.17s]  It's time to put up or shut up.
[15786.17s -> 15787.29s]  I got to get a dirty hit on him.
[15788.33s -> 15788.89s]  Here it comes.
[15788.89s -> 15789.29s]  Dirty hit.
[15799.20s -> 15800.32s]  I wish I could run like that.
[15800.32s -> 15802.16s]  I mean, if that were me.
[15805.55s -> 15806.51s]  It fell down in the snow.
[15810.75s -> 15818.60s]  I got a bunch of like random dudes
[15818.60s -> 15820.92s]  from like the AA leagues in my lineup right now.
[15820.92s -> 15821.40s]  It's not me.
[15822.28s -> 15831.34s]  Not a bad return.
[15831.34s -> 15844.62s]  Let's do crosses.
[15844.62s -> 15844.94s]  All right.
[15844.94s -> 15845.34s]  Finally.
[15847.34s -> 15847.98s]  Robbie's back in.
[15849.90s -> 15851.82s]  The offense looking at first and 30.
[15858.52s -> 15859.00s]  There it is.
[15860.84s -> 15863.24s]  That's what they call a textbook execution.
[15873.29s -> 15875.69s]  Still haven't seen x-ray ball crush.
[15876.89s -> 15877.77s]  Resident sleeper.
[15883.18s -> 15883.58s]  He'll go.
[15884.60s -> 15885.24s]  Just tie it up.
[15893.31s -> 15903.87s]  I haven't unleashed.
[15903.87s -> 15904.83s]  Let's see if I can get the ball back.
[15905.79s -> 15909.44s]  Give me that ball back.
[15910.40s -> 15910.64s]  Bump.
[15913.84s -> 15916.00s]  And so at the end of one quarter of play.
[15916.00s -> 15916.64s]  We're tied.
[15920.35s -> 15922.91s]  You thought I was making the beer chugging sound effect?
[15926.51s -> 15928.03s]  That'd be pretty cool if I was.
[15928.75s -> 15931.95s]  Where are we going?
[15931.95s -> 15933.58s]  It's that damn quarterback.
[15935.12s -> 15945.53s]  Can't see them go to shit their pants.
[15946.33s -> 15949.16s]  Yeah, we do.
[15949.16s -> 15950.28s]  He's got a lot of viewers coming.
[15950.28s -> 15950.84s]  Is there a raid?
[15951.72s -> 15957.64s]  Did a raid just come in?
[15958.92s -> 15959.80s]  There's the dirty hit, right?
[15968.91s -> 15971.31s]  The quarterback is the paint and the paint.
[15971.31s -> 15973.15s]  Whoever is hosting or rating or whatever.
[15973.15s -> 15973.79s]  Thank you so much.
[15978.04s -> 15980.59s]  That's a shitload of people.
[15981.23s -> 15982.84s]  Oh, this is blitz the league.
[15985.55s -> 15986.11s]  Nice.
[15986.11s -> 15987.63s]  That's exactly what I needed to have happen.
[15988.43s -> 15995.55s]  They're going to punt it.
[15995.55s -> 15996.11s]  Oh, shit.
[15996.11s -> 15996.67s]  They're putting it.
[16002.30s -> 16003.18s]  They had a long way to go.
[16003.18s -> 16003.58s]  That's right.
[16007.07s -> 16007.71s]  Good run here.
[16007.71s -> 16008.03s]  Come on.
[16012.20s -> 16027.13s]  We're good.
[16027.13s -> 16027.69s]  Everything's fine.
[16033.10s -> 16034.46s]  First down and 30.
[16036.83s -> 16038.22s]  Get a good play here.
[16039.10s -> 16041.96s]  That was a good play.
[16042.76s -> 16047.96s]  I still got plenty of time in the quarter.
[16047.96s -> 16048.84s]  Trick play.
[16048.84s -> 16049.80s]  Razzle dazzle.
[16049.80s -> 16050.52s]  Razzle go.
[16050.52s -> 16052.04s]  One minute left in the half.
[16052.04s -> 16052.92s]  We're all tied up.
[16056.43s -> 16056.99s]  Wide open.
[16056.99s -> 16057.39s]  Beautiful.
[16057.39s -> 16058.43s]  Don't even need to use an unleash.
[16058.43s -> 16059.63s]  Defense lost track of it.
[16059.63s -> 16061.18s]  End zone.
[16061.18s -> 16068.25s]  Nice catch towards turning into a touchdown.
[16074.84s -> 16075.88s]  Nicely done.
[16075.88s -> 16078.44s]  We got them just where we want them.
[16078.44s -> 16079.64s]  Let's keep twisting the tournament.
[16079.64s -> 16080.92s]  No, just go for field goal.
[16080.92s -> 16081.32s]  No reason.
[16082.04s -> 16090.92s]  The extra point is good.
[16090.92s -> 16091.64s]  In a good position.
[16094.60s -> 16096.92s]  Can you do anything else besides the beer chug?
[16097.96s -> 16098.60s]  Yeah, you can.
[16098.60s -> 16099.56s]  I just don't know the code.
[16101.28s -> 16105.12s]  And the codes, it gives you a blip.
[16105.12s -> 16105.92s]  So that's why I'm doing it.
[16105.92s -> 16108.32s]  By the way, speaking of blips, injury incoming.
[16112.56s -> 16112.80s]  Yes.
[16112.80s -> 16114.48s]  Las Vegas makes the recovery.
[16114.48s -> 16114.96s]  Thank God.
[16116.08s -> 16117.20s]  It's going my way.
[16117.20s -> 16117.84s]  Championship game.
[16117.84s -> 16118.08s]  OK.
[16118.08s -> 16119.28s]  Oh, close call.
[16120.08s -> 16121.92s]  Tough guy didn't break a nail getting the ball back.
[16123.31s -> 16124.51s]  Let's go for a run.
[16124.51s -> 16126.11s]  Crucial series of downs here.
[16128.56s -> 16130.83s]  That's OK.
[16131.71s -> 16132.59s]  I still got plenty of time.
[16132.59s -> 16133.31s]  Run the clock out.
[16134.27s -> 16134.99s]  Oh, no.
[16135.55s -> 16137.23s]  Please tell me that wasn't his knee.
[16142.16s -> 16147.66s]  Looking for the big play.
[16147.66s -> 16149.66s]  And the defender says nothing doing.
[16150.78s -> 16152.22s]  PS4 or is this PS3?
[16152.22s -> 16153.66s]  OK, I'm thinking maybe we should.
[16154.62s -> 16157.16s]  Why the hell is the team's sideline?
[16159.79s -> 16163.90s]  The offense might want to mix it up here.
[16163.90s -> 16166.06s]  They've been a little predictable the first two downs.
[16171.45s -> 16172.73s]  All right, I can get a field goal.
[16173.45s -> 16174.96s]  Just don't screw it up.
[16174.96s -> 16175.44s]  Field goal.
[16177.90s -> 16178.54s]  Field goal.
[16178.54s -> 16180.62s]  OK, so am I going to aim this in the right place?
[16191.04s -> 16192.32s]  Triangle square X circle.
[16192.96s -> 16207.60s]  All right, you got that was a good lay hit.
[16209.63s -> 16210.11s]  Incoming.
[16210.11s -> 16210.99s]  Wrong guy, but it's fine.
[16215.15s -> 16216.59s]  We've been a little frame droppy today.
[16217.15s -> 16218.27s]  I apologize about that.
[16221.76s -> 16223.44s]  First down, 30 yards to go.
[16223.44s -> 16225.92s]  Just don't let them get a touchdown.
[16225.92s -> 16227.12s]  There's 11 seconds left.
[16227.84s -> 16233.02s]  That didn't count as a dirty hit.
[16233.02s -> 16236.67s]  Milwaukee really executed on that big step down the field.
[16236.67s -> 16237.23s]  Nice work.
[16243.80s -> 16245.16s]  That didn't count as a late hit.
[16250.84s -> 16251.88s]  Sorry, just ended.
[16253.95s -> 16257.31s]  And so at halftime, Las Vegas leads by 10.
[16261.95s -> 16262.59s]  I get the ball.
[16265.29s -> 16267.13s]  What the fuck is this clown shit?
[16267.13s -> 16268.25s]  This is blitz the lead.
[16269.53s -> 16270.81s]  I'm running it out of bounds.
[16270.81s -> 16271.21s]  No, I'm not.
[16271.21s -> 16272.25s]  I'm running it into the end zone.
[16273.53s -> 16276.40s]  Oh, come on.
[16276.40s -> 16277.36s]  That would have been perfect.
[16279.10s -> 16279.42s]  All right.
[16279.42s -> 16283.26s]  I got to I got to play the the boundaries here.
[16284.14s -> 16290.40s]  Because first and 30 very we're in snow weather vulnerable.
[16291.04s -> 16296.54s]  He cannot fumble the ball to play the outside.
[16297.34s -> 16305.88s]  Fine.
[16305.88s -> 16306.60s]  I'm okay with that.
[16307.32s -> 16319.44s]  Get in there.
[16320.16s -> 16325.76s]  This same guy a second injury.
[16325.76s -> 16326.80s]  Robbie is out again.
[16333.39s -> 16334.43s]  That was not good, but it's okay.
[16339.96s -> 16341.56s]  This guy is made out of jelly.
[16341.56s -> 16343.96s]  There's no way he's made out of like rubber bands or something.
[16345.64s -> 16346.44s]  Fourth and one.
[16353.98s -> 16354.78s]  I'm not confident.
[16355.64s -> 16355.88s]  Go.
[16356.52s -> 16357.48s]  Just right through the middle.
[16362.75s -> 16362.99s]  Nice.
[16366.51s -> 16369.55s]  Let's go lightning.
[16369.55s -> 16370.91s]  First down and 30.
[16374.96s -> 16381.72s]  Caught it.
[16381.72s -> 16382.84s]  Jelly rubber bands.
[16382.84s -> 16384.68s]  You see the blonde on the sideline?
[16384.68s -> 16385.16s]  See her?
[16385.16s -> 16385.72s]  Huh?
[16385.72s -> 16387.24s]  That's a nice piece of ass.
[16387.24s -> 16387.64s]  All right.
[16391.18s -> 16391.66s]  Right side.
[16392.30s -> 16396.01s]  Too fat to push him over.
[16401.92s -> 16402.24s]  All right.
[16402.24s -> 16402.72s]  Robbie's back.
[16406.08s -> 16407.68s]  Circle circle square.
[16408.56s -> 16409.28s]  X triangle.
[16411.04s -> 16414.08s]  Did I actually just do that?
[16416.08s -> 16416.32s]  Fuck.
[16419.50s -> 16419.98s]  Go for it.
[16419.98s -> 16420.46s]  I don't care.
[16422.70s -> 16423.74s]  What the fuck is happening?
[16431.55s -> 16431.95s]  Get up.
[16432.99s -> 16433.39s]  Touchdown.
[16439.55s -> 16439.95s]  Snow.
[16440.75s -> 16441.55s]  Stupid snow.
[16458.70s -> 16459.90s]  Trying to get squished.
[16459.90s -> 16461.02s]  I didn't have an opportunity to do it.
[16461.90s -> 16470.97s]  We're printed out of reach in the championship game.
[16470.97s -> 16479.02s]  We might see an entire...
[16479.02s -> 16480.46s]  That guy wasn't even hard to play.
[16482.36s -> 16483.24s]  Uh, it's...
[16483.24s -> 16483.64s]  I don't know.
[16483.64s -> 16484.28s]  We're gonna have to...
[16485.00s -> 16486.92s]  I'm not sure you're gonna be able to see the testicles.
[16487.72s -> 16489.42s]  Sorry, guys.
[16490.14s -> 16490.92s]  I'm trying.
[16495.13s -> 16500.94s]  Damn.
[16501.90s -> 16503.44s]  I'm trying.
[16503.44s -> 16505.15s]  That guy got hit for it.
[16505.15s -> 16505.79s]  Sometimes they...
[16505.79s -> 16508.03s]  You knock the quarterback in the next Tuesday.
[16508.03s -> 16513.82s]  Was that before or after when this game came out?
[16513.82s -> 16514.30s]  I don't know.
[16515.34s -> 16519.18s]  Goes way downfield.
[16519.18s -> 16521.26s]  And it's complete after 35.
[16522.14s -> 16524.92s]  Sorry.
[16524.92s -> 16525.72s]  We're still waiting.
[16525.72s -> 16527.80s]  Wrestling run after the catch for the score.
[16528.92s -> 16530.76s]  That's what I was trying to get a hit on the quarterback.
[16531.48s -> 16532.28s]  I would have had that guy.
[16532.28s -> 16532.92s]  I'm the safety.
[16532.92s -> 16534.04s]  I shouldn't be doing that play.
[16534.84s -> 16536.12s]  But I was doing it anyways, I guess.
[16536.12s -> 16536.44s]  Whatever.
[16537.08s -> 16537.56s]  I got it!
[16538.60s -> 16540.20s]  I actually fucking blocked the field goal.
[16542.20s -> 16542.52s]  Yes!
[16544.20s -> 16545.16s]  Oh, I've...
[16545.16s -> 16545.48s]  My...
[16545.48s -> 16546.84s]  Okay, that's a weight off my shoulders.
[16547.96s -> 16554.96s]  By the way, I understand that that reaction was as if somebody was dropping a couch.
[16555.52s -> 16556.48s]  And I was on the other side.
[16558.65s -> 16558.89s]  I got...
[16558.89s -> 16559.29s]  I got it!
[16559.29s -> 16559.61s]  I got it!
[16560.17s -> 16563.15s]  First down.
[16563.15s -> 16564.03s]  30 yards to go.
[16570.06s -> 16570.62s]  Bad yardage.
[16573.13s -> 16574.41s]  Onside kick.
[16575.29s -> 16578.20s]  See, now they're just getting desperate.
[16578.20s -> 16579.00s]  Because I got the ball.
[16579.00s -> 16579.72s]  I got plenty of time.
[16596.36s -> 16597.40s]  All right, now I'm just being an asshole.
[16601.72s -> 16601.96s]  What?
[16605.48s -> 16606.12s]  Robbie, no!
[16612.30s -> 16613.18s]  He tried so hard.
[16613.82s -> 16614.54s]  He tried.
[16614.54s -> 16616.54s]  He was such an integral part of the team.
[16617.66s -> 16618.14s]  He's dead.
[16620.11s -> 16620.99s]  We gotta win this one.
[16625.53s -> 16627.45s]  Can I make this field goal?
[16627.45s -> 16628.01s]  Robbie's dead.
[16628.73s -> 16630.78s]  It's all right.
[16630.78s -> 16632.94s]  His memory will live on when we beat...
[16632.94s -> 16634.22s]  When we win the championship game.
[16637.08s -> 16639.16s]  To get out of Peewee leagues.
[16639.16s -> 16640.20s]  And to go into like...
[16642.49s -> 16643.69s]  Baby division.
[16643.69s -> 16647.52s]  Oops.
[16655.72s -> 16659.40s]  Do it for Robbie.
[16660.04s -> 16661.00s]  I'm gonna do it for Robbie.
[16663.95s -> 16665.07s]  From Peewee...
[16665.07s -> 16666.51s]  From Peewee to Weewee.
[16667.79s -> 16668.03s]  Yep.
[16672.08s -> 16673.28s]  He's a good player, too.
[16673.84s -> 16678.27s]  This is it!
[16679.77s -> 16680.41s]  Oh, no!
[16680.41s -> 16680.89s]  That's the...
[16680.89s -> 16681.77s]  That's the quarterback.
[16687.42s -> 16688.30s]  Out for the season.
[16691.16s -> 16698.68s]  Got it.
[16698.68s -> 16701.48s]  Nah, this game is unwinnable for them.
[16701.48s -> 16703.08s]  They have a backup quarterback in right now.
[16703.08s -> 16703.96s]  Why don't we kill him too?
[16707.08s -> 16712.17s]  We gotta get revenge for...
[16713.37s -> 16714.65s]  Robbie, what are you talking about?
[16714.65s -> 16715.29s]  Don't do that.
[16715.29s -> 16716.25s]  You don't want revenge.
[16716.81s -> 16719.85s]  For the broken, shattered neck that they gave to Robbie.
[16723.37s -> 16724.49s]  What the hell was that?
[16724.49s -> 16725.45s]  What the hell was that?
[16726.41s -> 16731.45s]  Flocky tears up a good chunk of field there.
[16731.45s -> 16732.97s]  And you can see him getting revved up.
[16734.72s -> 16735.52s]  First and goal.
[16735.52s -> 16736.56s]  It's gut check time.
[16741.34s -> 16746.78s]  What the fuck was that?
[16747.58s -> 16750.65s]  What the...
[16750.65s -> 16753.21s]  He could have fixed the receiver's eyesight at that time.
[16753.21s -> 16755.29s]  He could have garnered his name with a receiver's helmet.
[16755.29s -> 16757.29s]  He could have leveled the receiver's bookshelf.
[16757.29s -> 16759.45s]  Lasers are amazing things!
[16759.45s -> 16760.25s]  Okay.
[16760.25s -> 16761.61s]  Well, now this just became a game.
[16762.65s -> 16765.69s]  So, I have to run the clock out.
[16769.50s -> 16773.42s]  And the extra point is good.
[16774.30s -> 16776.22s]  They need a touchdown and a two-pointer version.
[16777.02s -> 16779.34s]  And as long as I can get a field goal.
[16779.34s -> 16781.42s]  It looks like they'll try an on-side kick here.
[16782.38s -> 16786.73s]  Uh-oh, Cox.
[16788.32s -> 16790.88s]  I don't have my all-star half-back though.
[16791.60s -> 16802.24s]  Pick it up.
[16802.24s -> 16804.22s]  Las Vegas gets it back.
[16804.22s -> 16807.00s]  Oh, the defense can taste that.
[16807.00s -> 16808.84s]  Game over if I can get an end-zoner.
[16812.81s -> 16816.01s]  I should get it because I have the unleashed championship.
[16816.01s -> 16816.89s]  Comes to Las Vegas.
[16826.11s -> 16827.07s]  Beer chug again!
[16833.10s -> 16834.30s]  27-40.
[16834.30s -> 16835.26s]  Fourth quarter game over.
[16835.26s -> 16835.58s]  I win.
[16838.97s -> 16841.23s]  Want to see something funny?
[16843.32s -> 16848.88s]  Oh, this doesn't run the clock out.
[16850.27s -> 16850.51s]  Oh.
[16852.00s -> 16852.24s]  Right.
[16852.24s -> 16852.72s]  Never mind.
[16855.84s -> 16856.80s]  I'm getting booed.
[16862.60s -> 16864.12s]  Yeah, on their home turf.
[16868.49s -> 16868.89s]  Good job.
[16868.89s -> 16871.77s]  I forgot that I thought the clock was going to run out.
[16871.77s -> 16886.00s]  That should have been a safety.
[16889.45s -> 16890.41s]  I'm not looking for wagers.
[16890.41s -> 16891.29s]  I'm looking for...
[16891.29s -> 16892.49s]  Wait, how many points do I have to win by?
[16907.23s -> 16908.75s]  That was such a bomb pass.
[16909.95s -> 16915.68s]  That's your last play.
[16915.68s -> 16916.40s]  Don't matter.
[16916.40s -> 16917.68s]  Might as well just give you a touchdown.
[16918.56s -> 16918.88s]  Fun.
[16919.68s -> 16925.48s]  And I got one second.
[16925.48s -> 16925.96s]  Quick, quick, quick.
[16925.96s -> 16926.60s]  I want to hurt somebody.
[16927.24s -> 16928.12s]  Let's game over.
[16928.12s -> 16929.56s]  Championship wins.
[16929.56s -> 16934.12s]  So Las Vegas wins the Division III championship and will move up to Division II.
[16934.12s -> 16934.52s]  That's it.
[16935.24s -> 16935.88s]  I win the game.
[16940.67s -> 16941.31s]  Robbie's dead.
[16945.02s -> 16946.67s]  Out forever.
[16953.96s -> 16955.56s]  I didn't get the $20,000 wager.
[16960.60s -> 16962.20s]  Silver trophy for a rookie.
[16963.16s -> 16963.95s]  Very nice.
[16964.67s -> 16969.08s]  I miss Robbie.
[16969.64s -> 16977.44s]  Both your A&B samples came back positive, son.
[16977.44s -> 16978.48s]  This is bullshit.
[16978.48s -> 16980.64s]  He's never used steroids in his life.
[16980.64s -> 16983.92s]  You're trying to bend him over because he wouldn't play for your precious LA Riot.
[16985.29s -> 16988.97s]  You know, franchise, I can make this go away.
[16990.17s -> 16994.49s]  If you play for the Riot and sign a six-year contract.
[16994.49s -> 16995.13s]  Oh, I got...
[16996.33s -> 16996.73s]  I got...
[16996.73s -> 16997.85s]  Fuck you.
[16997.85s -> 16998.49s]  No deal.
[16999.13s -> 17000.33s]  They're conspiring against me.
[17000.33s -> 17001.05s]  This is what's going on.
[17001.13s -> 17003.53s]  Last, if the sponsors hear you flunked a drug test.
[17003.53s -> 17006.01s]  Man, I ain't flunked no fucking drug test.
[17007.71s -> 17009.87s]  Except you probably did because we've been taking drugs the whole season.
[17014.35s -> 17015.39s]  Oh, shit.
[17015.39s -> 17018.51s]  Ultranull is on the FBI's banned substance list.
[17018.51s -> 17022.11s]  In fact, you've probably taken a drug every other game, franchise.
[17022.11s -> 17023.31s]  Sir, you're under arrest.
[17023.31s -> 17023.71s]  What the hell?
[17023.71s -> 17024.91s]  No time to explain.
[17024.91s -> 17026.03s]  Gotta get you a lawyer.
[17026.03s -> 17026.83s]  You give up that right.
[17026.83s -> 17030.03s]  Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
[17030.99s -> 17039.52s]  Quick, dive out the window.
[17050.27s -> 17051.45s]  Is this the prison?
[17051.45s -> 17056.25s]  From the Newtown State Correctional Facility, Mr. Franchise.
[17057.29s -> 17061.37s]  Ordinarily, I don't like having celebrities in my prison.
[17061.37s -> 17064.89s]  However, you're a happy exception.
[17064.89s -> 17067.52s]  Man, what's this?
[17067.52s -> 17071.44s]  Well, it just so happens that next month we're having our annual football game
[17071.44s -> 17073.68s]  against the Supermax facility down the road.
[17074.56s -> 17076.56s]  And you just became my ringer, son.
[17077.44s -> 17078.64s]  That ain't no movie.
[17078.64s -> 17080.88s]  I ain't playing in some prison game.
[17080.88s -> 17083.12s]  You can play and be out of here in time for training camp.
[17083.12s -> 17084.40s]  Or you can refuse.
[17084.40s -> 17087.28s]  And piss away the next two years making license plates.
[17087.28s -> 17087.84s]  Or have to win.
[17088.48s -> 17089.20s]  So what do you say?
[17090.57s -> 17091.45s]  Super Bowl II.
[17092.17s -> 17093.13s]  Get out of jail.
[17093.13s -> 17093.77s]  Sounds good to me.
[17094.89s -> 17096.59s]  What time is practice?
[17099.85s -> 17103.77s]  Milltown Correctional versus the Supermax prison team.
[17106.89s -> 17109.87s]  There's a reason we've never beaten the Supermax prison team.
[17110.83s -> 17111.72s]  Oh, God.
[17112.76s -> 17116.64s]  It's guys like Carl Turpitz that have made that hell hole their home.
[17117.44s -> 17123.60s]  Turpitz is serving time for 23 counts of aggravated assault.
[17124.72s -> 17125.76s]  No helmets either.
[17126.88s -> 17140.72s]  Too bad we can't beat Shackle.
[17143.12s -> 17143.84s]  This is wild.
[17144.88s -> 17145.28s]  All right.
[17145.84s -> 17148.40s]  So, yeah, I think I know how to play the game.
[17155.69s -> 17156.67s]  What are the rules?
[17158.35s -> 17159.23s]  Is it just a game?
[17159.95s -> 17161.47s]  Is anybody watching?
[17162.19s -> 17169.98s]  No, this is it.
[17169.98s -> 17170.70s]  We're just out here.
[17171.58s -> 17173.93s]  Who are my teammates?
[17177.04s -> 17177.76s]  Oh, God.
[17177.76s -> 17178.72s]  This is ridiculous.
[17178.72s -> 17179.04s]  Okay.
[17179.04s -> 17180.56s]  So there's no kickoff.
[17181.28s -> 17183.21s]  There he is.
[17183.21s -> 17183.45s]  All right.
[17183.45s -> 17184.89s]  Watch out for the guy on the left.
[17184.89s -> 17186.25s]  First and 45.
[17189.24s -> 17189.56s]  Got it.
[17189.56s -> 17190.44s]  Touchdown right there.
[17191.24s -> 17191.96s]  First play of the game.
[17192.76s -> 17193.16s]  Get it.
[17194.14s -> 17194.46s]  Got it.
[17197.80s -> 17199.32s]  It's 45 yards from first down.
[17209.28s -> 17209.68s]  Muscle?
[17210.40s -> 17211.76s]  I got a new playbook.
[17213.80s -> 17214.20s]  Okay.
[17214.20s -> 17214.60s]  Wait a minute.
[17214.60s -> 17214.92s]  Hold on.
[17214.92s -> 17215.32s]  There's no...
[17216.96s -> 17217.76s]  There's no field goal.
[17220.64s -> 17224.36s]  You have to do a two-point conversion?
[17225.08s -> 17232.33s]  And now, okay, there's no kickoff.
[17232.33s -> 17233.69s]  There's no special teams.
[17234.33s -> 17235.21s]  This is ridiculous.
[17236.41s -> 17238.88s]  All right.
[17238.88s -> 17239.28s]  Not bad.
[17239.84s -> 17244.44s]  Well, let's go with...
[17244.44s -> 17245.24s]  Let's stay with cover.
[17246.28s -> 17247.64s]  That guy's not on the field right now.
[17252.92s -> 17253.72s]  Take the shoulder off.
[17258.40s -> 17260.08s]  That's always the most devastating one.
[17260.08s -> 17266.03s]  That guy gonna get up?
[17267.58s -> 17268.78s]  Nobody comes and even picks him up.
[17278.46s -> 17278.94s]  Is this it?
[17294.72s -> 17295.04s]  What?
[17296.73s -> 17298.97s]  Forgot how fucking awful that was.
[17299.95s -> 17300.19s]  Ooh.
[17302.32s -> 17303.12s]  All right.
[17303.12s -> 17303.52s]  We're good.
[17304.72s -> 17311.77s]  That's a turnover.
[17312.33s -> 17314.19s]  Let's go.
[17314.75s -> 17315.63s]  Let's go with the slant play.
[17322.64s -> 17323.04s]  Got it.
[17323.84s -> 17324.24s]  I'm still...
[17324.24s -> 17324.40s]  No.
[17324.40s -> 17324.96s]  Nobody touch me.
[17324.96s -> 17325.52s]  Nobody touch me.
[17327.10s -> 17327.74s]  Oh, what's it?
[17327.74s -> 17329.10s]  Oh, beer chug.
[17344.32s -> 17344.64s]  All right.
[17344.64s -> 17344.96s]  I got...
[17345.92s -> 17346.16s]  It's...
[17346.96s -> 17347.95s]  It's all right.
[17352.76s -> 17353.16s]  Nice.
[17353.16s -> 17353.56s]  It's all right.
[17355.32s -> 17355.88s]  14-0.
[17356.44s -> 17357.71s]  Come on, man.
[17357.71s -> 17359.87s]  We gotta do this all day.
[17359.87s -> 17360.83s]  Let's get up, man.
[17360.83s -> 17361.47s]  Come on.
[17361.47s -> 17362.67s]  That's not the same voice actor.
[17362.67s -> 17363.95s]  That's a completely different voice.
[17366.27s -> 17366.75s]  Come on, man.
[17366.75s -> 17368.43s]  We gotta do this all day.
[17370.43s -> 17373.68s]  Is he going with it?
[17378.08s -> 17378.32s]  Nice.
[17378.32s -> 17379.36s]  That's a fumble recovery.
[17380.52s -> 17380.84s]  That's a...
[17380.84s -> 17393.08s]  56.
[17393.08s -> 17394.25s]  56.
[17394.25s -> 17398.14s]  Play hit.
[17398.14s -> 17398.70s]  No helmets.
[17410.19s -> 17411.07s]  Let's go with zone blitz.
[17413.29s -> 17413.61s]  Cox.
[17413.61s -> 17414.33s]  Oh, Cox.
[17415.21s -> 17416.25s]  Cox is being stupid.
[17419.07s -> 17421.36s]  Fuck.
[17421.36s -> 17422.32s]  I was trying to knock him down.
[17423.12s -> 17424.96s]  I was trying to just jump into him.
[17425.60s -> 17427.60s]  Now, everybody does like the shit emote.
[17434.88s -> 17443.63s]  Oh.
[17456.08s -> 17456.40s]  Shit.
[17458.51s -> 17459.87s]  That's a safety.
[17459.87s -> 17460.67s]  Where are we?
[17461.63s -> 17462.67s]  What the...
[17462.67s -> 17463.71s]  Where was that?
[17463.71s -> 17464.91s]  Oh, my God.
[17464.91s -> 17465.63s]  That was bad.
[17470.67s -> 17471.55s]  This is bad.
[17479.93s -> 17484.75s]  Oh, the game's...
[17484.75s -> 17485.47s]  The game broke.
[17486.43s -> 17487.15s]  This is...
[17487.15s -> 17488.19s]  This is all glitched out.
[17489.15s -> 17493.21s]  Dude, I just intercepted the fucking football.
[17493.21s -> 17504.38s]  I can't get out of here.
[17507.71s -> 17508.03s]  Wow.
[17510.19s -> 17510.43s]  Okay.
[17510.43s -> 17513.79s]  Can we maybe relax here a second and...
[17521.12s -> 17523.20s]  Something is fucked up with this controller, I think.
[17524.16s -> 17524.96s]  Something's going on.
[17524.96s -> 17525.28s]  Weird.
[17527.05s -> 17527.53s]  I lost...
[17528.33s -> 17529.93s]  I don't see any player icons.
[17529.93s -> 17530.73s]  Shit.
[17530.73s -> 17531.21s]  See what I'm saying?
[17531.21s -> 17531.93s]  What the hell's going on?
[17532.89s -> 17533.13s]  Who's...
[17534.01s -> 17539.04s]  You guys know what I'm talking about.
[17539.04s -> 17539.76s]  Like, this is weird.
[17540.64s -> 17542.96s]  Did I win?
[17543.68s -> 17551.15s]  Yeah, something ain't right.
[17556.54s -> 17557.10s]  Ain't right.
[17557.74s -> 17561.60s]  I won.
[17574.96s -> 17595.45s]  I won the game, too.
[17595.45s -> 17596.25s]  That's unfortunate.
[17597.05s -> 17605.04s]  I'm gonna call that a win.
[17605.76s -> 17608.46s]  Did I save the game?
[17608.46s -> 17610.25s]  I'm pretty sure.
[17610.89s -> 17613.26s]  I'm pretty sure save is on by default, isn't it?
[17614.22s -> 17615.82s]  Your current game progress would be lost.
[17619.00s -> 17620.36s]  Yeah, I got soft-locked somehow.
[17631.23s -> 17632.27s]  I knew something weird was going on.
[17632.27s -> 17633.55s]  I lost the player icons.
[17638.25s -> 17638.49s]  Yeah.
[17638.49s -> 17638.81s]  All right.
[17638.81s -> 17641.18s]  Well, that's annoying.
[17642.22s -> 17645.13s]  See if it's still there.
[17649.60s -> 17652.16s]  Everything got really fucky after the ghost interception.
[17654.20s -> 17655.72s]  It soft-locked the whole game.
[17663.18s -> 17664.46s]  That was going so well, too.
[17667.74s -> 17668.38s]  Okay, here we go.
[17669.50s -> 17670.70s]  Should be back to normal, right?
[17671.66s -> 17671.98s]  Yes.
[17671.98s -> 17672.94s]  Now I see icons again.
[17672.94s -> 17673.74s]  That was very weird.
[17674.46s -> 17675.42s]  I'll just beat him again.
[17676.38s -> 17676.94s]  Just win.
[17677.90s -> 17685.13s]  Is it snowy outside or...
[17685.13s -> 17685.93s]  I don't understand.
[17687.64s -> 17688.20s]  We're gonna...
[17688.20s -> 17688.60s]  His hand...
[17702.56s -> 17704.56s]  There goes his wrist.
[17704.56s -> 17706.16s]  And his forearm.
[17713.76s -> 17715.12s]  Let's hope he was right-handed.
[17717.04s -> 17717.28s]  Yeah.
[17718.16s -> 17718.72s]  I agree.
[17726.22s -> 17729.31s]  Another exploded collar bone.
[17729.31s -> 17730.11s]  And we're gonna make it even.
[17743.96s -> 17745.00s]  Was that the arm?
[17745.00s -> 17746.28s]  Was that the arm that he did that with?
[17746.28s -> 17747.48s]  That was with the busted...
[17747.48s -> 17748.76s]  That was with the fucked up shoulder, too.
[17749.32s -> 17750.20s]  That's so funny.
[17760.91s -> 17762.03s]  All right, let's do some muscle here.
[17764.44s -> 17764.84s]  Belly.
[17764.84s -> 17766.28s]  We got some weird movement there.
[17767.00s -> 17770.92s]  And go wide open.
[17773.92s -> 17775.56s]  Touchdown.
[17780.38s -> 17781.42s]  I couldn't punch into code.
[17785.15s -> 17785.87s]  Go right up the middle.
[17788.99s -> 17794.83s]  There are no...
[17795.71s -> 17796.83s]  Yeah, there's no kicker.
[17797.47s -> 17798.19s]  There's no punts.
[17798.19s -> 17798.91s]  There's no kicking.
[17801.18s -> 17801.74s]  It's just...
[17802.86s -> 17803.26s]  Play.
[17803.26s -> 17804.14s]  No field goals.
[17808.49s -> 17809.37s]  That was beautiful.
[17811.56s -> 17812.84s]  He anticipated that dough
[17812.84s -> 17814.44s]  for the exact moment that he needed to.
[17815.32s -> 17818.60s]  And this should get another touchdown right here.
[17818.60s -> 17818.92s]  You know what?
[17818.92s -> 17819.24s]  Fuck it.
[17819.24s -> 17819.72s]  Watch this.
[17823.69s -> 17824.57s]  No, that's me.
[17848.32s -> 17849.84s]  My back hurts after that.
[17849.84s -> 17850.64s]  Oh, come on.
[17858.57s -> 17863.85s]  That was fucking ridiculous.
[17866.49s -> 17870.03s]  I was gonna go for a QB sneak
[17870.83s -> 17872.35s]  and get another free touchdown.
[17897.32s -> 17899.61s]  Up in the old end zone in the sky.
[17899.61s -> 17901.53s]  This is like doing it for me somehow.
[17901.53s -> 17908.73s]  I'm like fucking...
[17908.73s -> 17909.77s]  What the hell was that?
[17911.96s -> 17914.20s]  Oh, not safety.
[17914.20s -> 17914.92s]  No.
[17915.72s -> 17917.40s]  How big is this field?
[17926.46s -> 17928.22s]  This is the second time.
[17928.22s -> 17931.80s]  First time, I had a ghost interception
[17931.80s -> 17932.76s]  and it fucked up the game
[17932.76s -> 17934.76s]  and I was up by like 14 points.
[17935.32s -> 17937.96s]  Now, I was up by 14 points again
[17937.96s -> 17939.96s]  and they broke my neck and ruined my career.
[17940.44s -> 17942.44s]  And I'm like, what the fuck is going on here?
[17942.44s -> 17943.96s]  I'm like, what the fuck is going on here?
[17943.96s -> 17945.72s]  I'm like, what the fuck is going on here?
[17946.68s -> 17948.44s]  Okay, I need to get these off.
[17950.84s -> 17952.70s]  It's a 50-yard field.
[17952.70s -> 17953.90s]  You only get one possession.
[17954.70s -> 17970.19s]  I can't get over that.
[17970.19s -> 17970.69s]  Stupid.
[17978.03s -> 17978.99s]  How did they have 10?
[17988.04s -> 17988.54s]  Me.
[17994.68s -> 17995.40s]  I love this game.
[18018.20s -> 18021.00s]  So that's man crush knockout
[18021.00s -> 18022.60s]  is square, square, triangle, triangle.
[18037.31s -> 18037.79s]  All right.
[18037.79s -> 18039.47s]  Can somebody explain to me why
[18041.20s -> 18042.72s]  we just both did the same thing
[18042.72s -> 18044.16s]  and they have two extra points?
[18049.72s -> 18050.28s]  I don't get it.
[18050.28s -> 18050.78s]  What happened?
[18051.48s -> 18056.28s]  Oh, the safety.
[18056.28s -> 18058.12s]  Right, the safety in the beginning of the game.
[18058.12s -> 18059.16s]  Right, right, right.
[18059.16s -> 18059.66s]  Of course.
[18063.44s -> 18064.00s]  Of course.
[18065.28s -> 18068.92s]  Go for the elbow.
[18069.72s -> 18075.96s]  Oh, it was the forearm again.
[18078.81s -> 18085.16s]  You gotta watch this.
[18088.12s -> 18094.22s]  There it is.
[18094.22s -> 18094.94s]  Another shoulder.
[18096.94s -> 18097.90s]  Yeah, kick him in the shoulder.
[18099.02s -> 18100.94s]  We see that one all the time.
[18101.74s -> 18103.26s]  The exploded collarbone.
[18103.26s -> 18104.38s]  It's very, very loud.
[18105.50s -> 18107.26s]  Burn left.
[18107.82s -> 18109.60s]  Oh, no, they're going up the middle.
[18109.60s -> 18110.64s]  They're going right up the middle.
[18122.01s -> 18123.53s]  Mortal Kombat wishes it was this gross.
[18123.53s -> 18125.05s]  Well, this is what I was talking about.
[18125.05s -> 18127.29s]  When I was talking about how the new Mortal Kombat games,
[18127.29s -> 18128.41s]  after this game came out,
[18129.21s -> 18131.85s]  they started doing that, like disgusting stuff.
[18145.10s -> 18146.38s]  Listen, why?
[18146.38s -> 18147.90s]  This dude didn't have to do it.
[18148.86s -> 18150.06s]  He just fell.
[18150.06s -> 18151.98s]  Oh, I fucking don't even know what to say.
[18153.90s -> 18160.16s]  The dude just fucking rolled over
[18160.16s -> 18161.84s]  and his collarbone exploded.
[18164.83s -> 18169.48s]  What is it?
[18169.48s -> 18169.98s]  What is it?
[18177.96s -> 18179.16s]  Was Ed Boon the dev?
[18179.16s -> 18180.04s]  I don't actually don't know.
[18181.00s -> 18182.28s]  This is an old Midway game.
[18183.00s -> 18186.28s]  I'm not sure if Ed had anything to do with it,
[18186.28s -> 18187.40s]  but watch out for the guy on the left.
[18192.73s -> 18193.23s]  Perfect.
[18199.07s -> 18199.63s]  Take it to him.
[18199.63s -> 18200.59s]  That's all it is.
[18200.59s -> 18201.87s]  Just keep your head in the game.
[18201.87s -> 18202.37s]  All right.
[18202.99s -> 18203.23s]  All right.
[18203.23s -> 18204.27s]  Can I actually win this one?
[18211.39s -> 18212.35s]  No, I don't even know what I did.
[18212.35s -> 18212.85s]  I tried to.
[18213.96s -> 18214.46s]  No, no.
[18224.67s -> 18225.39s]  The same guy.
[18226.03s -> 18227.39s]  Same guy, same shoulder.
[18228.59s -> 18236.76s]  They got the ball back.
[18238.01s -> 18238.97s]  We're going to go to overtime.
[18243.28s -> 18244.48s]  Oh, is that just the first quarter?
[18250.51s -> 18251.47s]  Third and 31.
[18251.47s -> 18252.51s]  No, we just keep going.
[18252.51s -> 18253.07s]  Second quarter.
[18257.28s -> 18262.30s]  No, I don't think I could see that.
[18262.30s -> 18263.90s]  I could smell you from a mile away.
[18264.62s -> 18267.04s]  I knew exactly what the hell you were doing.
[18267.04s -> 18271.62s]  I'll tell you what.
[18281.00s -> 18286.20s]  Thank you.
[18286.20s -> 18291.60s]  We got a ball spike.
[18292.32s -> 18307.92s]  That's the worst one.
[18308.48s -> 18312.20s]  I'm going muscle.
[18312.20s -> 18312.68s]  I'm going to go.
[18313.88s -> 18315.92s]  I have meter.
[18315.92s -> 18316.56s]  Let's go right in the middle.
[18321.68s -> 18331.57s]  I'm up.
[18332.03s -> 18332.86s]  I'm up.
[18332.86s -> 18333.10s]  I'm up.
[18333.10s -> 18333.34s]  I'm up.
[18333.34s -> 18333.84s]  I'm up.
[18337.79s -> 18338.75s]  No, Jeremy.
[18338.75s -> 18340.03s]  What the heck are you doing?
[18340.83s -> 18342.52s]  Just try to catch it.
[18342.52s -> 18345.00s]  I'm so hell bent on da.
[18345.00s -> 18345.64s]  Whatever.
[18345.64s -> 18346.14s]  Fuck.
[18349.84s -> 18355.39s]  I was trying to like dive into him and it's okay.
[18356.27s -> 18358.59s]  Now we are on a completely even playing field.
[18359.71s -> 18361.55s]  Safety in the beginning of the game does not matter now.
[18375.82s -> 18379.60s]  They've got an he's got a goddamn power here.
[18394.27s -> 18396.43s]  All right, we both have unleash.
[18398.40s -> 18398.88s]  Red zone.
[18398.88s -> 18399.36s]  We're going to go.
[18403.60s -> 18407.12s]  I don't want to use my unleash.
[18407.12s -> 18407.68s]  I want him to.
[18411.14s -> 18413.30s]  Wait, is that me?
[18416.38s -> 18417.10s]  No, thank God.
[18417.10s -> 18417.58s]  That's not me.
[18419.41s -> 18419.91s]  Okay.
[18420.53s -> 18422.96s]  I thought that was the end of the career again.
[18422.96s -> 18423.68s]  Thank God.
[18424.40s -> 18425.44s]  So now I have it.
[18425.44s -> 18426.56s]  See if I can convert this.
[18428.70s -> 18429.26s]  Nice play.
[18438.72s -> 18444.05s]  That's exactly what I wanted.
[18445.01s -> 18445.51s]  No.
[18450.66s -> 18451.62s]  It was for the team.
[18452.26s -> 18453.66s]  You did it for the team.
[18456.45s -> 18458.05s]  That was the guy that did the super tackle.
[18459.17s -> 18473.28s]  Triangle, square, square, triangle.
[18473.28s -> 18474.00s]  I'll try it next time.
[18484.06s -> 18484.56s]  Oops.
[18485.50s -> 18486.00s]  No.
[18486.64s -> 18501.04s]  Can I just play a game of football without having one of my bones explode?
[18501.04s -> 18519.28s]  Can I play everybody?
[18519.28s -> 18523.04s]  It's just like a 40% chance that if you get tackled,
[18523.04s -> 18525.44s]  your collarbone is going to blow up.
[18526.96s -> 18528.08s]  Just I got it.
[18528.08s -> 18529.04s]  He's the quarterback.
[18531.14s -> 18533.30s]  I'm the quarterback and I'm the safety.
[18533.30s -> 18534.98s]  Can I put him on the bench for the game?
[18545.17s -> 18546.05s]  God damn it.
[18546.69s -> 18551.38s]  I have to keep him away completely away from harm's way.
[18552.18s -> 18553.65s]  That means more runs.
[18571.84s -> 18573.92s]  Yeah, that bone heals in like five rounds.
[18573.92s -> 18575.76s]  If you get any injury, it's over.
[18587.22s -> 18589.70s]  Now I'm so terrified to even get involved in a play
[18590.98s -> 18593.54s]  because if I roll over out of bed like an old lady,
[18594.58s -> 18596.26s]  I'm going to get hurt.
[18597.06s -> 18608.68s]  That was good.
[18612.48s -> 18612.98s]  No.
[18613.28s -> 18613.78s]  No.
[18614.72s -> 18619.08s]  He's the quarterback.
[18623.62s -> 18625.30s]  Okay, seriously.
[18626.42s -> 18628.90s]  How am I with the quarterback?
[18629.86s -> 18630.50s]  I just had to...
[18636.72s -> 18638.16s]  Oh, come on.
[18638.16s -> 18639.28s]  He keeps dying.
[18643.49s -> 18648.26s]  Okay, so I'm going to run at every play.
[18655.04s -> 18656.88s]  I'm just going to hand it off to...
[18656.88s -> 18658.16s]  And they're going to take the fall for me.
[18660.28s -> 18661.32s]  Don't run it.
[18661.32s -> 18663.48s]  When I pass it, if I get hit, it's over.
[18664.34s -> 18668.42s]  I need to have my like halfback run and do like quick little slant plays
[18668.98s -> 18680.04s]  with these little things right here.
[18680.20s -> 18690.47s]  See, like it's everyone's made out of fucking paper.
[18691.35s -> 18693.17s]  Oh, no, it's that mean guy.
[18693.89s -> 18695.43s]  Who cares about this, dude?
[18695.43s -> 18696.23s]  Just get the touchdown.
[18698.07s -> 18703.49s]  Was it the square triangle, square triangle, triangle, square, triangle, square.
[18704.53s -> 18705.09s]  All right.
[18705.09s -> 18720.56s]  And the quarters, they're lasting a long time.
[18722.08s -> 18730.68s]  Triangle, square, square, triangle.
[18730.68s -> 18733.76s]  Okay, it was triangle, square, triangle.
[18733.76s -> 18735.28s]  It was triangle, square, square, triangle.
[18735.28s -> 18737.44s]  Okay, triangle, square, square, triangle.
[18738.24s -> 18738.96s]  There he is again.
[18739.12s -> 18747.16s]  There he is again.
[18748.50s -> 18748.98s]  That guy.
[18748.98s -> 18753.14s]  Inmate 274594866252784.
[18753.14s -> 18753.86s]  Doing a great job.
[18755.06s -> 18770.50s]  Now you're out forever.
[18773.86s -> 18774.34s]  Fourth down.
[18774.90s -> 18779.24s]  I'll use it if I have to.
[18780.04s -> 18796.12s]  Oh, turnover.
[18796.12s -> 18796.36s]  Good.
[18799.86s -> 18802.34s]  Just don't do a big pass.
[18805.41s -> 18806.69s]  See, like that, that's me.
[18807.41s -> 18808.85s]  That's me right now.
[18808.85s -> 18809.81s]  If that were...
[18809.81s -> 18810.85s]  If I had the ball still.
[18811.41s -> 18814.42s]  Who cares?
[18814.42s -> 18815.94s]  Forget about like the jobbers.
[18815.94s -> 18816.26s]  Like the...
[18817.30s -> 18818.42s]  Hulk Hogan used to fight.
[18819.38s -> 18820.50s]  Like a nameless dude.
[18822.63s -> 18823.35s]  Don't catch that.
[18825.11s -> 18830.15s]  Who cares about like the warm-up matches?
[18830.79s -> 18836.15s]  Down shit.
[18836.71s -> 18840.50s]  Oh man, we got to do this all day.
[18841.06s -> 18842.02s]  Let's get up, man.
[18842.02s -> 18842.66s]  Come on.
[18842.66s -> 18843.06s]  All right.
[18849.01s -> 18851.97s]  See, everyone's getting their skull fractured.
[18853.33s -> 18859.78s]  What are they feeding us in here?
[18860.66s -> 18863.65s]  Whatever it is, it's not nutritious at all.
[18868.48s -> 18869.60s]  Nice catch, Tucker.
[18873.01s -> 18875.41s]  My character cannot put his hands on the ball.
[18877.91s -> 18878.95s]  I'm serious at this point.
[18878.95s -> 18881.11s]  I just have to run the clock out and try to play defense.
[18884.21s -> 18895.20s]  Didn't work.
[18895.20s -> 18897.60s]  I think I have to unlock them or something.
[18904.72s -> 18906.44s]  It's all right.
[18906.44s -> 18907.72s]  I'm up by 12 points.
[18907.72s -> 18914.55s]  And on defense too.
[18914.55s -> 18915.59s]  I can fall the wrong way.
[18915.59s -> 18916.71s]  I can roll the wrong way.
[18917.75s -> 18920.31s]  There's so many ways this goes wrong.
[18921.11s -> 18926.68s]  Clean.
[18927.24s -> 18928.36s]  Stay alive.
[18928.36s -> 18935.00s]  I got unleash.
[18935.96s -> 18937.76s]  Stay up.
[18938.56s -> 18940.88s]  That's probably only two halves.
[18942.00s -> 18949.12s]  Fumble.
[18949.12s -> 18951.92s]  Oh, I got squished.
[18951.92s -> 18952.32s]  Fumble.
[18954.77s -> 18955.09s]  Yes.
[18963.78s -> 18964.26s]  Okay.
[18964.26s -> 18964.58s]  Don't.
[18965.46s -> 18966.02s]  Just run.
[18966.66s -> 18967.22s]  Just run it.
[18968.34s -> 18979.40s]  I am up by a lot.
[18980.28s -> 18980.84s]  This long.
[18982.92s -> 18983.40s]  I don't.
[18983.40s -> 18984.36s]  I don't have to play.
[18984.36s -> 18985.96s]  I just have to survive.
[18985.96s -> 18987.80s]  This quarterback survived.
[18994.96s -> 18996.16s]  I could potentially turn it over.
[18996.16s -> 18996.88s]  No, I'm not going to do that.
[18997.44s -> 18998.40s]  I think it's like a half, right?
[19004.42s -> 19006.88s]  Okay.
[19007.52s -> 19008.80s]  18 to zero.
[19008.80s -> 19009.52s]  First quarter time.
[19015.04s -> 19016.08s]  All they have to do is kill me.
[19016.80s -> 19019.12s]  But as long as I keep myself out of harm's way, it's not going to happen.
[19019.68s -> 19024.72s]  Let's try to get the ball converted here.
[19029.32s -> 19034.24s]  I'm so concerned.
[19035.12s -> 19036.34s]  I got to kill that guy.
[19036.34s -> 19036.66s]  I know.
[19036.66s -> 19036.98s]  I know.
[19036.98s -> 19038.02s]  I know I got to kill this guy.
[19038.90s -> 19049.03s]  Doesn't matter.
[19049.03s -> 19051.04s]  Just always stay one step ahead.
[19056.21s -> 19059.22s]  Use it.
[19060.74s -> 19063.99s]  I don't remember using my unleash.
[19065.14s -> 19066.50s]  And Jeremy, why are you passing?
[19071.94s -> 19073.14s]  Thank God it wasn't.
[19073.14s -> 19074.50s]  It was this random asshole.
[19094.98s -> 19095.86s]  Classic beer chug.
[19095.86s -> 19096.18s]  Let's go.
[19098.23s -> 19099.43s]  I don't care about my team.
[19099.43s -> 19099.99s]  No, I don't.
[19101.38s -> 19102.10s]  Because there's no...
[19105.30s -> 19105.94s]  Nothing happened.
[19106.74s -> 19107.62s]  This is not my team.
[19110.40s -> 19111.28s]  I need to stay alive.
[19119.56s -> 19119.88s]  Okay.
[19130.47s -> 19132.58s]  Like this is probably the one.
[19132.58s -> 19142.40s]  We're not going to get any phantom players.
[19142.40s -> 19144.32s]  We're not going to get any broken necks.
[19146.00s -> 19153.73s]  He jumped over me.
[19153.73s -> 19155.81s]  Don't do any unnecessary dives with that character.
[19156.37s -> 19172.07s]  Let's go with the muscle again just to fake around.
[19173.19s -> 19173.59s]  That...
[19173.59s -> 19174.63s]  They have an unleash.
[19174.63s -> 19175.99s]  This is a guaranteed injury.
[19180.71s -> 19180.95s]  See?
[19181.83s -> 19183.22s]  They didn't use it.
[19199.27s -> 19199.51s]  Nice.
[19204.21s -> 19204.61s]  Okay.
[19205.25s -> 19206.13s]  Things are looking up.
[19209.35s -> 19210.07s]  Rushing attack.
[19210.95s -> 19211.75s]  Get rid of the ball!
[19212.79s -> 19213.67s]  Just don't be right.
[19223.17s -> 19224.53s]  Oh my God.
[19224.53s -> 19226.76s]  If I had to do this again.
[19227.32s -> 19230.53s]  I might have just had a heart attack.
[19230.53s -> 19232.61s]  I seriously thought I was going to have to do this all over again.
[19232.61s -> 19234.21s]  Look at how far we are into the game.
[19249.64s -> 19250.28s]  Where are my...
[19251.00s -> 19252.12s]  It's getting weird again.
[19252.12s -> 19252.60s]  I don't have...
[19264.96s -> 19265.92s]  No, it's getting weird.
[19269.28s -> 19271.12s]  People are walking in random directions and shit.
[19271.12s -> 19271.36s]  Okay.
[19271.36s -> 19272.56s]  I got to stop him here and that should be game.
[19275.40s -> 19279.88s]  Bingo.
[19281.54s -> 19282.50s]  Just run the ball.
[19282.50s -> 19283.86s]  Just run the clock out.
[19283.86s -> 19284.98s]  Just do balanced.
[19284.98s -> 19285.14s]  Just...
[19286.58s -> 19288.98s]  Just run it.
[19289.62s -> 19291.11s]  Who cares?
[19293.67s -> 19298.42s]  Pretty sick.
[19303.17s -> 19303.81s]  No timeouts.
[19304.37s -> 19304.77s]  I don't know.
[19304.77s -> 19305.33s]  What did I just do?
[19305.33s -> 19305.97s]  What play was that?
[19306.77s -> 19307.89s]  What play was that?
[19308.85s -> 19315.75s]  It's actually halftime.
[19319.46s -> 19320.02s]  He just was like,
[19320.02s -> 19321.62s]  Oh shit, I'm not supposed to have this ball.
[19321.62s -> 19322.26s]  You take it.
[19323.14s -> 19328.82s]  You actually have to play through all four quarters like this.
[19330.10s -> 19349.96s]  All I need is just to keep...
[19349.96s -> 19350.52s]  Stay ahead.
[19352.20s -> 19353.56s]  This is why you spec tank.
[19354.44s -> 19356.53s]  Yeah, I did not do that.
[19356.53s -> 19357.01s]  You're right.
[19358.21s -> 19365.46s]  All of my points went into tackling and what?
[19365.46s -> 19366.18s]  Like strength.
[19367.30s -> 19375.25s]  All right.
[19375.25s -> 19376.21s]  They don't get a touchdown in this game.
[19377.17s -> 19377.97s]  No, it's not true.
[19378.93s -> 19380.04s]  It's close.
[19380.04s -> 19382.74s]  We're number one down.
[19382.74s -> 19383.14s]  Perfect.
[19383.78s -> 19386.66s]  Dermot is so stressed.
[19386.66s -> 19388.18s]  He hasn't made a joke in like an hour.
[19389.62s -> 19391.78s]  Yeah, because I want to get out of the prison arc.
[19392.90s -> 19401.14s]  Oh, I broke his spine by punching him in the face.
[19402.42s -> 19408.15s]  How do you play?
[19408.15s -> 19410.31s]  That was some Mortal Kombat uppercut shit there.
[19415.40s -> 19417.56s]  That was Scorpion does that.
[19419.16s -> 19421.57s]  Doesn't that move that Scorpion does?
[19424.58s -> 19426.66s]  Self is a better player than me.
[19426.74s -> 19428.82s]  Well, I'm playing very timidly because I don't want to die.
[19429.70s -> 19433.49s]  No, I haven't passed the ball.
[19446.53s -> 19447.33s]  Self doing the work.
[19447.33s -> 19447.73s]  That's great.
[19449.83s -> 19455.06s]  Self, he almost had it.
[19455.06s -> 19455.54s]  No, was that?
[19455.54s -> 19456.34s]  No, that wasn't self.
[19457.38s -> 19468.42s]  All right.
[19468.42s -> 19470.26s]  I was going for a little bit of a play there.
[19471.46s -> 19482.05s]  Turnover.
[19483.01s -> 19484.21s]  They can't get by the defense.
[19484.21s -> 19484.77s]  This is good.
[19486.47s -> 19486.95s]  Same deal.
[19519.19s -> 19519.67s]  Hubert.
[19521.35s -> 19524.07s]  I'm not quite a lot though.
[19525.20s -> 19525.44s]  No.
[19535.94s -> 19537.30s]  Boomer overconfident.
[19539.83s -> 19540.87s]  Wait, is that?
[19540.87s -> 19542.07s]  No, I don't know.
[19542.07s -> 19542.63s]  It doesn't matter.
[19542.63s -> 19543.59s]  I'm up by so much.
[19543.59s -> 19544.15s]  It doesn't matter.
[19553.73s -> 19554.37s]  I don't want this.
[19563.80s -> 19564.44s]  Right to self.
[19567.43s -> 19571.11s]  Okay, just right through the middle.
[19578.29s -> 19579.09s]  Fourth quarter.
[19579.09s -> 19579.81s]  We're almost done.
[19581.83s -> 19582.39s]  No, no, no.
[19582.39s -> 19585.43s]  Give me something easy right here.
[19593.83s -> 19594.55s]  Really?
[19594.55s -> 19601.78s]  That was kind of stupid.
[19602.74s -> 19603.83s]  Let's go.
[19605.11s -> 19608.82s]  That guy's dead.
[19609.54s -> 19637.14s]  I was trying to taunt, run, and it's the same stick as juke.
[19637.14s -> 19639.54s]  If it doesn't show up on the screen, you juke instead.
[19665.28s -> 19667.92s]  Made that look so good.
[19667.92s -> 19669.44s]  But holy shit, was it bad.
[19675.00s -> 19675.72s]  I got this.
[19677.03s -> 19679.35s]  That looked real cool for how bad it actually was.
[19687.83s -> 19688.15s]  All right.
[19688.15s -> 19690.87s]  I need to stop this nonsense and fucking win the goddamn game.
[19690.87s -> 19696.88s]  Again, he jumped up again and missed it again.
[19699.19s -> 19699.67s]  It's all right.
[19699.67s -> 19701.59s]  He needs like two more touchdowns.
[19701.59s -> 19703.11s]  It's not going to happen.
[19703.11s -> 19705.75s]  See, it's not going to happen.
[19705.75s -> 19709.51s]  My patrol officer says I got to control my anger.
[19709.51s -> 19710.07s]  Fuck that.
[19710.79s -> 19713.44s]  I'm going to get one right here.
[19715.14s -> 19722.71s]  Oh my god, what a fucking hero.
[19723.83s -> 19724.31s]  Don't do it.
[19726.63s -> 19727.27s]  I got it.
[19729.27s -> 19730.07s]  He ran out of gas.
[19730.07s -> 19730.55s]  It's okay.
[19731.11s -> 19732.15s]  We're going right up the middle.
[19743.32s -> 19743.80s]  Same thing, dude.
[19743.80s -> 19744.76s]  Again, exact same play.
[19744.76s -> 19745.48s]  They're not ready for it.
[19748.23s -> 19751.64s]  I got it.
[19751.64s -> 19752.20s]  Across the plane.
[19753.89s -> 19755.41s]  Now it's impossible for them to win.
[19765.16s -> 19766.52s]  Imagine if I broke my back there.
[19768.36s -> 19769.64s]  I would have shit my pants.
[19770.44s -> 19795.83s]  I got to kill the quarterback.
[19795.83s -> 19796.23s]  I have to.
[19799.68s -> 19807.36s]  Okay, I don't.
[19807.36s -> 19808.64s]  The play doesn't matter.
[19808.64s -> 19809.36s]  Just get rid of it.
[19810.08s -> 19827.68s]  I win.
[19827.68s -> 19828.16s]  It's over.
[19834.24s -> 19835.17s]  Early release.
[19835.17s -> 19836.61s]  The warden is pleased with your good behavior
[19836.61s -> 19839.57s]  and has arranged for your sentence to be reduced to time served.
[19839.57s -> 19840.05s]  You're free.
[19842.53s -> 19845.76s]  That was the real Super Bowl.
[19846.48s -> 19851.97s]  What about self?
[19851.97s -> 19852.85s]  Can self get out too?
[19856.40s -> 19860.53s]  Trade offer to be traded.
[19860.53s -> 19861.94s]  Hey, Ashwin.
[19863.28s -> 19863.76s]  Oh, what?
[19863.76s -> 19867.27s]  Oh, I can get Cho from.
[19868.44s -> 19868.84s]  All right.
[19868.84s -> 19869.64s]  That's insane.
[19870.28s -> 19871.32s]  Why would you want this?
[19871.32s -> 19872.28s]  Why would you give this to me?
[19873.88s -> 19876.12s]  Oh, I can pick anybody from.
[19878.26s -> 19878.66s]  I see.
[19879.30s -> 19882.12s]  From the last division.
[19882.12s -> 19885.11s]  All right, who do I got?
[19885.11s -> 19885.67s]  What do I got?
[19885.67s -> 19887.83s]  B minus for wide receiver.
[19887.83s -> 19888.87s]  What do I need improvement here?
[19890.98s -> 19891.62s]  Halfback.
[19891.62s -> 19892.42s]  Robbie died.
[19892.42s -> 19897.83s]  So wide receiver.
[19897.83s -> 19898.47s]  Wallace.
[19898.47s -> 19899.03s]  Look at that.
[19899.75s -> 19903.11s]  That's a huge upgrade.
[19903.75s -> 19905.91s]  We're going to go with Wallace.
[19908.85s -> 19909.89s]  Or Sullivan.
[19911.04s -> 19912.08s]  No, Wallace definitely.
[19912.64s -> 19916.32s]  Wait, hold on.
[19916.32s -> 19916.96s]  This is Cookie.
[19916.96s -> 19918.56s]  Wasn't he bad?
[19918.56s -> 19921.32s]  Doesn't Cookie bring the whole team down?
[19925.94s -> 19927.78s]  The only thing that will happen if I bring on Cho
[19927.78s -> 19929.70s]  is everybody will sleep with his wife, right?
[19938.98s -> 19940.74s]  That's what happened the last time.
[19941.30s -> 19941.94s]  Something like that.
[19942.58s -> 19949.92s]  It's tough to get rid of a B minus for an A minus.
[19950.88s -> 19952.88s]  I'd rather get rid of like a C for an A.
[19953.84s -> 19954.64s]  What about Sullivan?
[19954.64s -> 19957.52s]  No, we got to keep Robbie back from the dead.
[19958.16s -> 19959.91s]  Defensive.
[19959.91s -> 19960.71s]  What a latch off.
[19961.27s -> 19962.63s]  This is a defensive tackle.
[19963.43s -> 19964.79s]  Kind of necessary.
[19969.65s -> 19970.53s]  96 strength.
[19972.12s -> 19973.08s]  82 tackle.
[19973.80s -> 19980.92s]  I'm going to take Cho.
[19982.37s -> 19983.33s]  Or the tackle.
[19985.00s -> 19987.16s]  C plus versus an A minus.
[19987.72s -> 19988.60s]  Way more strength.
[19989.32s -> 19991.67s]  Yeah, we need some more defense.
[19992.39s -> 19996.23s]  I'm going for Latcho.
[20004.61s -> 20005.33s]  Robbie's dead.
[20005.33s -> 20006.05s]  We get rid of him.
[20006.05s -> 20007.41s]  Dump Robbie's corpse.
[20008.13s -> 20012.63s]  Dump Robbie's corpse.
[20013.19s -> 20015.25s]  I mean, this is true.
[20015.25s -> 20016.05s]  He's dead.
[20016.05s -> 20021.52s]  Was Sullivan a team player?
[20021.52s -> 20029.32s]  We have to bury him.
[20029.32s -> 20029.80s]  He died.
[20032.96s -> 20037.56s]  Plus, an A minus halfback is ridiculous.
[20037.56s -> 20037.80s]  Done.
[20041.67s -> 20043.43s]  I know we're going to keep him for the meme,
[20043.43s -> 20046.95s]  but guys, the halfback is one of the most important players in the whole field.
[20046.95s -> 20048.28s]  Robbie's gone.
[20048.28s -> 20055.43s]  An A minus halfback.
[20055.43s -> 20062.47s]  You saw his neck explode.
[20062.47s -> 20063.19s]  That's good news.
[20063.75s -> 20065.43s]  Listen, you should know.
[20065.43s -> 20067.99s]  It's going to take a while to rebuild relationships,
[20067.99s -> 20070.07s]  both with sponsors and with me,
[20070.07s -> 20071.83s]  but I'm willing to stick with it if you are.
[20071.83s -> 20075.99s]  And hey, I just want to make sure that everyone's aware of this.
[20077.11s -> 20079.59s]  Robbie got injured every five plays.
[20081.09s -> 20084.45s]  So he was actually really on the field,
[20084.45s -> 20088.50s]  maybe like 50 to 60 percent of the time.
[20088.50s -> 20092.47s]  So did you really like Robbie?
[20095.16s -> 20096.44s]  He did make a few good plays,
[20097.46s -> 20100.44s]  but I mean, very though.
[20100.44s -> 20112.63s]  I'm going to pick you up busy trying to line you up some news.
[20112.63s -> 20115.99s]  You do know all the old sponsors bailed when you were convicted, right?
[20115.99s -> 20117.35s]  I didn't even know the sponsors.
[20117.35s -> 20119.59s]  But don't worry, because you work your magic on the field,
[20119.59s -> 20121.59s]  I'll do mine off the field and I will be forgiven.
[20122.47s -> 20126.37s]  Okay, so I got a question for those of you
[20126.37s -> 20128.05s]  that are in the stream hanging out here still.
[20130.42s -> 20135.65s]  Would anybody be against me beating this campaign?
[20136.64s -> 20137.84s]  Maybe not necessarily tonight,
[20137.84s -> 20144.72s]  but like next stream?
[20144.88s -> 20146.56s]  Would anybody think that that was a bad idea?
[20147.20s -> 20152.53s]  Because I forgot just how much fun this was.
[20154.84s -> 20160.29s]  Okay, so next stream, we're going to continue this.
[20162.74s -> 20164.42s]  I'm not stopping yet, by the way.
[20166.50s -> 20168.82s]  I just know that I'm not going to be able to get it done this stream.
[20172.24s -> 20174.16s]  So sorry, I couldn't pick you up from the slam.
[20174.88s -> 20177.52s]  Franchise must perform three different touchdown celebrations.
[20178.50s -> 20180.50s]  Next game, I got to do three different celebrations.
[20180.50s -> 20181.38s]  Do I unlock them?
[20182.26s -> 20183.51s]  Oh, okay, hold on a second.
[20183.51s -> 20183.99s]  Let me look at this.
[20187.68s -> 20191.17s]  Ace Attorney next year.
[20191.17s -> 20193.92s]  No, no, no.
[20193.92s -> 20199.43s]  So we got it was half back, right?
[20199.43s -> 20202.42s]  That's me and I'm a B right now.
[20203.14s -> 20206.40s]  There's Sullivan, the new halfback.
[20209.03s -> 20209.83s]  Bernie Cox.
[20210.55s -> 20213.14s]  How do I delete this character?
[20213.78s -> 20215.46s]  How do I trade this one?
[20215.46s -> 20216.26s]  Can I just delete them?
[20216.90s -> 20221.28s]  All right, we got a good halfback.
[20221.28s -> 20222.56s]  Fullback, not so good.
[20223.12s -> 20227.01s]  This guy's terrible.
[20227.57s -> 20229.52s]  I need some better receivers.
[20229.52s -> 20231.76s]  Ashwin's, that's why I didn't want to get rid of Ashwin.
[20231.76s -> 20236.95s]  Because B minus is the only, all these other guys suck.
[20238.63s -> 20239.11s]  Tight end.
[20239.83s -> 20243.30s]  Did this back up the B minus?
[20243.30s -> 20243.94s]  That's not bad.
[20247.41s -> 20249.49s]  Punter, my punter's not, the kicker's not bad.
[20250.37s -> 20251.73s]  I have a pretty decent kicker in punter.
[20252.37s -> 20258.72s]  I could have got Cookie,
[20258.72s -> 20260.48s]  but Cookie would have brought the whole team down.
[20260.48s -> 20266.07s]  Let's go to the trainer upgrades.
[20266.71s -> 20269.22s]  So I have 400, I need hands.
[20269.22s -> 20270.58s]  I told you this is the first thing I was going to do.
[20271.70s -> 20272.50s]  Grip master.
[20273.22s -> 20273.94s]  Do it.
[20273.94s -> 20281.86s]  Which leaves me with turbo jets.
[20281.86s -> 20283.06s]  I can't, I can't put anything else.
[20283.06s -> 20283.94s]  We can take drugs.
[20284.74s -> 20287.19s]  Train automatically.
[20287.19s -> 20288.23s]  What do we got?
[20288.23s -> 20298.04s]  So let me give, where is Sullivan?
[20298.04s -> 20298.44s]  There we go.
[20298.44s -> 20301.94s]  Okay, Sullivan's going to take decreased clash drain.
[20301.94s -> 20303.22s]  That sounds pretty good for a halfback.
[20303.94s -> 20306.58s]  Turbo bar drain slower.
[20306.58s -> 20308.10s]  That's really good for a halfback.
[20308.10s -> 20308.34s]  Yeah.
[20309.06s -> 20310.56s]  Wait, what's with the team risk?
[20310.56s -> 20312.80s]  Oh no, I just got in trouble for taking drugs.
[20312.80s -> 20316.10s]  How do I take those off?
[20318.56s -> 20321.68s]  Fuck.
[20321.68s -> 20327.62s]  I just got out of prison and I can't remove it.
[20327.62s -> 20329.14s]  I am going back to jail, I think.
[20330.61s -> 20333.72s]  Los Angeles riot is the next game.
[20333.72s -> 20337.32s]  Need to win five games to advance.
[20342.90s -> 20346.58s]  They're a much better team.
[20347.14s -> 20351.49s]  Las Vegas must stay within 11 points at the final score.
[20354.87s -> 20358.44s]  Look at how much better of a team they are.
[20359.00s -> 20359.48s]  Let's go.
[20360.36s -> 20363.00s]  Finally, we get to play the Los Angeles riot.
[20363.56s -> 20365.56s]  Our beloved commissioner's dream team.
[20366.28s -> 20369.48s]  The captain of this gang of all-stars is Bruno Bataglia.
[20369.48s -> 20371.72s]  Veteran linebacker and all-around asshole.
[20372.44s -> 20376.20s]  Bataglia surgically upgraded his elbow with a titanium replacement.
[20377.16s -> 20380.92s]  Not good considering the man already wrote the book on cheap shots.
[20380.92s -> 20383.64s]  Every Sunday he writes another chapter.
[20385.35s -> 20386.87s]  All right, be careful.
[20386.87s -> 20388.87s]  Titanium bionic elbow guy.
[20395.92s -> 20397.68s]  Titanium people's elbow.
[20398.40s -> 20405.48s]  Helmets become mandatory.
[20415.48s -> 20417.56s]  It's weird because this game actually still holds up pretty well.
[20417.56s -> 20418.92s]  Hi and thanks for joining us.
[20420.18s -> 20421.94s]  Nearly, what, 10, 15 years later?
[20422.74s -> 20424.60s]  It's a nice field.
[20425.32s -> 20430.18s]  Does it?
[20430.18s -> 20430.98s]  Yeah, I think it does.
[20434.58s -> 20435.08s]  Elbow.
[20437.04s -> 20442.23s]  Good luck.
[20442.23s -> 20442.71s]  See you later.
[20447.88s -> 20450.12s]  Fractured wrist out for eight games.
[20451.16s -> 20452.44s]  Say goodbye to your special teams.
[20456.20s -> 20457.88s]  So we're going to get a balanced defense here.
[20458.52s -> 20463.80s]  I got to be careful on offense because that's their captain.
[20468.05s -> 20468.53s]  Blocked it.
[20469.73s -> 20471.80s]  Still got it.
[20471.80s -> 20473.00s]  That was a 10% hit too.
[20474.36s -> 20475.84s]  Is this my new guy?
[20477.99s -> 20479.03s]  I think that, is that the new guy?
[20479.75s -> 20483.11s]  No, no, no, no.
[20483.11s -> 20483.83s]  He's a halfback.
[20483.83s -> 20484.33s]  Never mind.
[20497.51s -> 20498.55s]  This is where I gotta be careful.
[20498.55s -> 20501.99s]  So we have, he's right up the middle.
[20510.61s -> 20511.81s]  Holy shit, you still got it.
[20513.81s -> 20514.53s]  Better hands.
[20515.57s -> 20516.69s]  We've seen bounces.
[20517.89s -> 20518.77s]  Yeah, Madden's back.
[20518.77s -> 20519.57s]  We'll fake Madden.
[20521.09s -> 20527.04s]  Thank God I got away from him.
[20529.46s -> 20530.10s]  And there he is.
[20534.24s -> 20534.96s]  There's Sullivan.
[20535.68s -> 20542.93s]  Worth the pick up for sure.
[20543.49s -> 20548.02s]  You see how well he dodged there?
[20548.02s -> 20548.58s]  Team captain.
[20549.30s -> 20550.18s]  Nah, he's gonna field goal.
[20558.84s -> 20559.80s]  I almost just blew that one.
[20562.13s -> 20563.25s]  Very different celebrations.
[20563.25s -> 20563.75s]  Yep.
[20564.29s -> 20567.36s]  I think I have to unlock them somehow.
[20568.08s -> 20575.00s]  When's the next bathroom break?
[20575.96s -> 20577.88s]  There probably will not be a bathroom break.
[20578.44s -> 20579.78s]  Oh my goodness.
[20580.42s -> 20586.90s]  There will probably be an end of the stream for the next break, technically.
[20587.78s -> 20589.46s]  Bathroom's closed.
[20592.69s -> 20596.37s]  No game, good.
[20598.68s -> 20599.64s]  End of the stream P.
[20605.04s -> 20605.54s]  Haha.
[20606.72s -> 20611.70s]  Really kept that.
[20613.70s -> 20614.50s]  Still no first down.
[20618.82s -> 20620.53s]  Kill the other team captain odd.
[20621.33s -> 20622.37s]  Gotta get the ball first.
[20623.09s -> 20623.89s]  He's on defense.
[20627.70s -> 20628.79s]  Where you at?
[20628.79s -> 20629.29s]  Where you at?
[20630.23s -> 20634.00s]  He's got all the time in the world.
[20635.43s -> 20636.23s]  Kill him.
[20636.23s -> 20637.19s]  Kill their quarterback.
[20642.53s -> 20643.03s]  Yes.
[20643.57s -> 20649.67s]  Bruce Kinney out of the game.
[20651.48s -> 20652.68s]  Out for five plays.
[20652.68s -> 20653.24s]  That sucks.
[20653.96s -> 20657.06s]  Well, and they're punting.
[20657.06s -> 20676.61s]  And he's tackled at the 35th and so at the end of one quarter play.
[20676.61s -> 20677.73s]  I could have turned that into something crazy.
[20677.73s -> 20679.65s]  Las Vegas leads by seven.
[20680.69s -> 20682.87s]  That was a pretty decent play.
[20684.21s -> 20685.65s]  I have to get into that end zone.
[20688.85s -> 20694.02s]  He goes way downfield and he makes the crack.
[20694.02s -> 20695.30s]  And they make the attack.
[20695.30s -> 20698.50s]  Las Vegas with a nice game there thanks to some key downfield blocks.
[20698.50s -> 20699.46s]  Just pissing a draw?
[20700.58s -> 20702.15s]  What pissing a draw?
[20703.03s -> 20713.03s]  Let's get the ball to Sullivan.
[20713.03s -> 20713.67s]  New halfback.
[20715.11s -> 20716.87s]  What's going on?
[20720.85s -> 20723.25s]  Sullivan with a fucking beautiful catch.
[20731.94s -> 20732.98s]  We're pretty close.
[20732.98s -> 20734.02s]  Let's hit the end zone.
[20734.58s -> 20737.91s]  He should be able to run it right in.
[20739.35s -> 20741.50s]  It's okay.
[20741.96s -> 20744.62s]  Tongue?
[20745.32s -> 20745.82s]  Tongue?
[20747.16s -> 20747.64s]  You see that?
[20747.64s -> 20749.56s]  I've seen more gains in my mutual fun.
[20750.36s -> 20751.32s]  Not really.
[20751.32s -> 20752.68s]  That's just as pathetic.
[20753.80s -> 20757.19s]  Looks like his tongue is hanging out.
[20757.19s -> 20757.69s]  Do you see that?
[20761.49s -> 20762.77s]  Las Vegas covers it up.
[20764.37s -> 20764.87s]  Fuck.
[20766.68s -> 20767.64s]  Thank god for that guy.
[20767.64s -> 20768.20s]  I can get there.
[20768.20s -> 20768.60s]  Damn!
[20768.60s -> 20769.88s]  That wasn't very cordial.
[20770.76s -> 20771.26s]  Get in there.
[20788.52s -> 20789.48s]  He's your brother?
[20789.48s -> 20791.24s]  Big series of downs upcoming.
[20791.96s -> 20798.21s]  Touchdown!
[20798.21s -> 20799.09s]  Different celebrations!
[20799.09s -> 20802.26s]  Las Vegas now leads by 13.
[20802.26s -> 20802.76s]  Dead.
[20803.14s -> 20811.62s]  Sorry, I got too confused there.
[20811.62s -> 20818.23s]  Point is good.
[20818.23s -> 20819.91s]  That was awesome.
[20821.32s -> 20822.04s]  LA Riot.
[20822.76s -> 20823.56s]  Better team.
[20823.56s -> 20825.32s]  You don't get the chemistry that I do.
[20826.20s -> 20828.37s]  You got the stats on paper,
[20828.37s -> 20830.13s]  but you don't get the heart I do.
[20835.19s -> 20836.56s]  See you in the second half.
[20837.54s -> 20839.30s]  And with the first half of the books,
[20839.30s -> 20841.46s]  Las Vegas leads by 14.
[20842.42s -> 20844.74s]  Should have made the bet.
[20844.74s -> 20847.06s]  Yeah, look at the stat difference though.
[20847.86s -> 20850.90s]  I figured it was going to be difficult.
[20851.62s -> 20854.50s]  It was like a one and 14 that I had trouble with.
[20854.50s -> 20855.54s]  Not like the LA Riot.
[20856.60s -> 20857.10s]  Somehow.
[20857.80s -> 20862.12s]  Oh, he should be careful.
[20863.00s -> 20863.50s]  Stay back.
[20870.56s -> 20872.16s]  I'm gonna bingo.
[20874.72s -> 20877.84s]  Did I just break that tackle?
[20878.80s -> 20879.30s]  Oh no!
[20880.00s -> 20892.18s]  It's just a sprained neck.
[20892.18s -> 20893.78s]  It's not a broken neck.
[20893.78s -> 20895.51s]  It's not a broken neck.
[20896.07s -> 20897.51s]  I was about to be very sad.
[20904.02s -> 20905.78s]  83% hit being in two places.
[20908.10s -> 20910.02s]  Oh man, if this was a neck and shadow,
[20910.02s -> 20911.22s]  that would have been so sad.
[20911.22s -> 20912.74s]  I would have actually been so sad.
[20914.02s -> 20916.53s]  We got a new half back in.
[20917.73s -> 20919.30s]  First down.
[20919.30s -> 20920.02s]  Don't really care about.
[20924.53s -> 20925.65s]  He almost died.
[20926.61s -> 20927.25s]  No, he didn't.
[20927.25s -> 20928.05s]  He's going boys.
[20928.05s -> 20929.97s]  Okay, four new downs to play with.
[20929.97s -> 20930.93s]  It's just tight stretch.
[20933.40s -> 20934.20s]  Oh, it is caught.
[20934.92s -> 20937.75s]  He's going long.
[20939.03s -> 20939.75s]  Who the hell was that?
[20939.75s -> 20940.79s]  Whoever they are, they're getting a raise.
[20941.83s -> 20942.92s]  Touchdown!
[20942.92s -> 20944.98s]  Las Vegas increases their lead.
[20944.98s -> 20945.48s]  Who is it?
[20946.18s -> 20946.74s]  Number 80.
[20947.46s -> 20952.76s]  Let's get a two-point conversion here.
[20955.35s -> 20958.55s]  He is going.
[20959.43s -> 20966.10s]  They can't even score any points.
[20966.98s -> 20971.22s]  I need to celebrate.
[20971.22s -> 20971.62s]  I couldn't.
[20971.62s -> 20972.18s]  I got tackled.
[20972.90s -> 20973.46s]  I got tackled.
[20973.46s -> 20974.42s]  If you get tackled in the end zone,
[20974.42s -> 20975.14s]  you can't celebrate.
[20976.10s -> 20978.76s]  I might not be able to get it this game.
[20979.80s -> 20984.72s]  Prison arc worked.
[20987.40s -> 20988.44s]  Well, what's this?
[20988.44s -> 20989.16s]  Las Vegas?
[20989.16s -> 20989.96s]  Better than LA?
[20990.76s -> 20994.00s]  Quarterback is in the game again.
[20994.00s -> 20994.24s]  This is...
[20994.24s -> 20995.04s]  Oh, that's why.
[20995.04s -> 20995.68s]  That's why.
[20995.68s -> 20996.18s]  I get it.
[20997.48s -> 20998.84s]  They haven't been doing shit because of that.
[21005.17s -> 21006.21s]  Envy football.
[21006.21s -> 21006.71s]  L-U-L.
[21011.19s -> 21012.39s]  The prison was the pit.
[21013.19s -> 21014.47s]  In the dark night.
[21020.21s -> 21022.45s]  Could I have gotten up potentially and caught that ball?
[21023.33s -> 21025.73s]  All right.
[21025.73s -> 21026.13s]  Let's do...
[21027.25s -> 21028.29s]  We're going to deep zones.
[21035.52s -> 21037.12s]  At today's section.
[21037.12s -> 21039.76s]  Let's try it.
[21039.76s -> 21041.68s]  The only other thing I can think of is that the quarterback must have thought
[21041.68s -> 21042.80s]  it was opposite day on that.
[21042.80s -> 21043.76s]  Tackle again.
[21043.76s -> 21044.56s]  Now people say,
[21044.56s -> 21047.04s]  sorry, I guess today must be opposite day when they screw up.
[21047.04s -> 21048.96s]  But for it really to be opposite day,
[21048.96s -> 21049.68s]  wouldn't it have to be?
[21049.68s -> 21050.48s]  Probably back in the game.
[21053.40s -> 21054.92s]  Crucial series of downs here.
[21054.92s -> 21059.92s]  He lets it fly.
[21060.56s -> 21061.04s]  Complete.
[21061.84s -> 21065.52s]  Un-voided, but I didn't even need to do my meter.
[21067.84s -> 21070.12s]  I wish I bet on this game.
[21070.12s -> 21072.84s]  Ever had that acid reflux, you know, with the heartburn and then,
[21072.84s -> 21073.88s]  you know, with the rest of it?
[21078.52s -> 21079.32s]  What are you going to do?
[21079.32s -> 21080.71s]  The extra point is good.
[21081.59s -> 21083.36s]  That's Ashwin, yeah.
[21083.36s -> 21084.24s]  Glad I didn't get rid of him.
[21085.36s -> 21093.70s]  I'm going to fail the challenge.
[21093.70s -> 21094.26s]  It's okay.
[21094.26s -> 21094.58s]  Don't worry.
[21094.58s -> 21095.38s]  You're going to see an injury.
[21096.74s -> 21097.46s]  That was just me.
[21100.36s -> 21101.80s]  The bet was to win by 11.
[21103.60s -> 21104.48s]  Holy shit.
[21104.48s -> 21107.12s]  10 community subs from Great Canadian FK Club.
[21108.64s -> 21110.69s]  This one's for you.
[21110.69s -> 21111.89s]  Thank you so much for the 10 subs.
[21112.69s -> 21122.82s]  Now that, that's a, that's a pog champ scenario, I think.
[21123.46s -> 21128.85s]  Could have caught it.
[21128.85s -> 21129.41s]  That meter.
[21131.78s -> 21132.34s]  Third down.
[21133.06s -> 21134.66s]  Bounce it out, little boys and girls.
[21144.45s -> 21146.85s]  Another 10 community subs from AmScoots.
[21148.93s -> 21150.13s]  10 community subs.
[21150.13s -> 21150.69s]  Back to back.
[21152.96s -> 21153.92s]  Thank you to the both of you.
[21155.33s -> 21156.13s]  10 community.
[21156.13s -> 21156.77s]  10 community.
[21157.41s -> 21159.44s]  You guys are fucking amazing.
[21159.44s -> 21159.76s]  Thank you.
[21160.32s -> 21163.81s]  Where are you going?
[21163.81s -> 21164.69s]  Why did he run that way?
[21175.04s -> 21175.84s]  I got an unleashed.
[21176.48s -> 21180.18s]  I got a sonic unleashed.
[21180.18s -> 21180.74s]  They do too.
[21181.62s -> 21182.82s]  Here comes the end of the third quarter.
[21182.82s -> 21183.78s]  Last play of the quarter.
[21185.19s -> 21185.69s]  And...
[21193.11s -> 21193.91s]  I didn't catch that.
[21196.87s -> 21198.07s]  I did not catch that ball.
[21199.59s -> 21201.67s]  And yeah, they should be chanting bullshit.
[21201.67s -> 21202.07s]  I would too.
[21203.19s -> 21207.14s]  Let's go for a run.
[21207.14s -> 21208.18s]  See if I can get it in the end zone.
[21213.68s -> 21214.72s]  No, no, no, no.
[21225.84s -> 21227.44s]  Oh, he's out for four games.
[21227.44s -> 21228.00s]  Come on.
[21229.27s -> 21232.63s]  That's, they're only like five, seven games in a season.
[21235.76s -> 21236.64s]  That's not good.
[21238.72s -> 21240.64s]  Now my 80 is going to have to step up.
[21240.64s -> 21241.36s]  That's Ashwin.
[21252.56s -> 21254.16s]  Ashwin really pulling it up here.
[21254.16s -> 21255.60s]  Miles on some more points.
[21260.18s -> 21261.62s]  The halfback Kirk.
[21263.62s -> 21264.74s]  Who's the halfback right now?
[21264.74s -> 21265.46s]  Cox?
[21265.46s -> 21266.74s]  All right, let's hope he gets his...
[21266.74s -> 21267.62s]  Let's hope he gets like his...
[21273.57s -> 21275.41s]  No, don't do an onside kick.
[21275.41s -> 21276.37s]  How do I change that?
[21277.01s -> 21289.17s]  It's all right.
[21289.17s -> 21290.69s]  I'm going to put 35 to nothing.
[21291.41s -> 21292.45s]  Everything's going to be just fine.
[21293.49s -> 21298.31s]  I, I'm going to put...
[21298.31s -> 21299.75s]  I'm going to go in the medical tent or whatever.
[21300.71s -> 21301.43s]  Put him in there.
[21311.27s -> 21312.87s]  I'm digging it deep.
[21313.59s -> 21314.76s]  They're getting desperate.
[21317.88s -> 21324.28s]  Is this the last game of the night?
[21324.28s -> 21325.80s]  This is going to be the last game of the night.
[21325.80s -> 21326.76s]  That is what's going to happen.
[21328.12s -> 21332.52s]  Figured it's probably a pretty good stopping place to beat Los Angeles as Las Vegas.
[21335.97s -> 21347.40s]  We will pick back up with this game because I, I am having a blast.
[21347.40s -> 21347.88s]  I love it.
[21348.76s -> 21350.12s]  And we're probably about...
[21350.12s -> 21356.36s]  We probably beat the halfway point of the campaign in the next game or two.
[21357.40s -> 21358.92s]  So, might as well just keep it going and...
[21360.52s -> 21362.36s]  Okay.
[21362.36s -> 21370.20s]  Have they haven't unleashed this whole game?
[21370.20s -> 21372.92s]  Well, they haven't really had possession of the ball for very long.
[21379.11s -> 21380.31s]  No conversion for you.
[21382.15s -> 21386.16s]  Did I get a ball crush yet?
[21386.16s -> 21386.72s]  Yes, I did.
[21387.28s -> 21388.00s]  Few times now.
[21390.88s -> 21391.83s]  That's not good.
[21392.79s -> 21395.35s]  He held onto it and he's not injured.
[21395.35s -> 21395.85s]  Good.
[21396.87s -> 21397.75s]  Got his revenge.
[21403.40s -> 21404.52s]  Two ball crushes.
[21404.52s -> 21405.02s]  Yeah.
[21406.12s -> 21410.21s]  Looking for, looking for, looking for somebody, looking for somebody.
[21410.21s -> 21410.71s]  Just go!
[21431.16s -> 21432.04s]  Cox getting in there.
[21433.32s -> 21433.82s]  Do it again.
[21439.48s -> 21443.24s]  Wow, that was fucking cool.
[21445.08s -> 21446.04s]  Um, um, hold on.
[21446.04s -> 21446.52s]  What is it?
[21446.52s -> 21447.48s]  I need to do one more, right?
[21448.28s -> 21449.00s]  I haven't done knockout.
[21449.00s -> 21450.20s]  Square, square, triangle, triangle.
[21451.48s -> 21453.30s]  That should be it.
[21454.50s -> 21459.72s]  Got it, right?
[21460.34s -> 21465.62s]  Do it again.
[21468.34s -> 21470.10s]  Just beat the fuck out of your own teammate.
[21473.99s -> 21475.51s]  Yeah, I thought I could stop him.
[21476.74s -> 21478.18s]  I thought I could stop him but I couldn't.
[21478.82s -> 21480.79s]  This game's over.
[21481.35s -> 21483.33s]  Start of the season 1-0.
[21492.39s -> 21495.32s]  It was a big hit but not enough to do an injury.
[21500.55s -> 21502.79s]  I think franchise has to do the celebrations.
[21502.79s -> 21503.29s]  Oh.
[21505.81s -> 21507.25s]  Well that, I don't think that's gonna happen then.
[21508.13s -> 21508.93s]  First and third.
[21508.93s -> 21509.57s]  Don't think so.
[21512.52s -> 21513.72s]  Do the philosophy mode.
[21515.40s -> 21517.41s]  Dirty hit on the floor.
[21517.41s -> 21517.91s]  That sack.
[21525.89s -> 21527.41s]  Well here's the injury potential right here.
[21529.97s -> 21531.41s]  Let's just go for a super blitz.
[21533.16s -> 21534.28s]  Just like a blitz.
[21535.81s -> 21536.31s]  Everybody.
[21537.19s -> 21537.69s]  All in.
[21548.50s -> 21548.98s]  You know what?
[21548.98s -> 21552.52s]  Like fucking field goal block.
[21564.04s -> 21564.84s]  He got it again.
[21572.26s -> 21577.40s]  Well I think I can stop it right here.
[21580.92s -> 21584.10s]  What a beautiful turnaround.
[21584.10s -> 21585.94s]  And there goes another broken frog wrist.
[21587.06s -> 21592.00s]  And that's the end of the game.
[21594.98s -> 21595.46s]  See you.
[21595.46s -> 21596.42s]  I'll see you in hell.
[21602.21s -> 21603.41s]  I get one more play here.
[21604.87s -> 21605.91s]  Hail Mary into the end zone.
[21605.91s -> 21607.51s]  See if I can win by like 50 points.
[21612.90s -> 21613.40s]  Cox!
[21617.80s -> 21618.84s]  Get in there Cox!
[21624.82s -> 21629.14s]  Too bad.
[21629.14s -> 21633.68s]  There's a lot of yards though.
[21636.44s -> 21637.48s]  There's a lot of achievements.
[21638.28s -> 21639.73s]  Probably a decent amount of money too.
[21645.60s -> 21646.24s]  No wager.
[21646.80s -> 21647.36s]  Oh well.
[21647.36s -> 21648.08s]  392.
[21648.64s -> 21649.04s]  Awesome.
[21651.78s -> 21652.98s]  Magic hands trophy.
[21656.32s -> 21658.32s]  And that's I think they're like the division leader.
[21660.96s -> 21663.68s]  I'm pretty sure I think that's like the antagonist in the whole game.
[21664.48s -> 21678.50s]  You just lost.
[21687.33s -> 21688.37s]  The ones that lost.
[21694.61s -> 21695.09s]  Slow down.
[21695.97s -> 21697.09s]  That's two shots in a row.
[21699.54s -> 21700.10s]  Slow down!
[21708.80s -> 21710.48s]  That's four shots of vodka?
[21716.92s -> 21717.72s]  He doesn't know.
[21727.54s -> 21728.10s]  Punch.
[21728.98s -> 21729.70s]  Three.
[21729.70s -> 21729.94s]  Two.
[21741.19s -> 21745.30s]  I'm gonna get fined.
[21754.72s -> 21755.52s]  Uh oh.
[21755.52s -> 21760.68s]  Franchise I gotta tell you this is not the way to endear yourself to potential new clients.
[21760.68s -> 21765.00s]  Sponsors are willing to overlook an arrest record but they still want winners!
[21765.64s -> 21769.24s]  Um dude I'm like fucking eight and one.
[21771.12s -> 21774.00s]  Hey man I hear you got a call from Tara a while back.
[21774.00s -> 21777.52s]  I know what she sounds like but trust me you're gonna want to meet with this girl.
[21777.52s -> 21779.68s]  She can hook you up with all kinds of shit.
[21779.68s -> 21782.88s]  And if she really likes what she sees she could be a real freak.
[21782.88s -> 21783.52s]  I think that's Cox.
[21783.52s -> 21784.16s]  You know what I mean.
[21785.52s -> 21789.76s]  Oh it's Bruno calling me now.
[21789.76s -> 21791.36s]  Hey punk how's it hanging?
[21792.32s -> 21797.99s]  Sorry I broke up your little love fest with sands but you know what they say the truth hurts.
[21798.63s -> 21802.23s]  When you're ready to leave that piece of shit team of yours and join the riot
[21802.23s -> 21803.51s]  give me a call.
[21803.51s -> 21805.19s]  Yeah I know the right people.
[21805.43s -> 21808.39s]  Hey Franchise got time for a meeting today?
[21808.39s -> 21811.75s]  I've got some paperwork for you to sign but trust me you're gonna like it.
[21811.75s -> 21816.71s]  You racked up over 200 yards on offense last Sunday and that got another big sponsor
[21816.71s -> 21819.35s]  beating down our door for your endorsement.
[21819.35s -> 21822.23s]  Award the pro cleats shoes by turf pros.

[21823.75s -> 21827.64s]  Protector, impact, crazy grip.
[21827.64s -> 21830.69s]  Pro cleats plus two speed.
[21831.41s -> 21832.13s]  Well I need them.
[21832.77s -> 21833.57s]  How much money do I have?
[21833.57s -> 21835.88s]  $392,000.
[21836.52s -> 21838.37s]  How much money do I have?

[21848.08s -> 21848.80s]  Two games out.
[21848.80s -> 21849.52s]  One game out.
[21850.48s -> 21852.24s]  Get as many staff on him as I can.
[21852.88s -> 21856.10s]  Okay so now he's only gonna be up with one game.
[21856.66s -> 21863.24s]  What do we got for upgrades?
[21863.88s -> 21866.93s]  I think I want to do hands again.
[21866.93s -> 21870.18s]  No probably speed.
[21870.18s -> 21873.28s]  Yeah let's get speed to two.
[21874.45s -> 21876.13s]  I have no money now but it was worth it.
[21878.64s -> 21879.20s]  Girlfriends.
[21880.00s -> 21883.97s]  Kim provides exclusive sponsor equipment.
[21884.69s -> 21887.06s]  I got uh nobody else here.
[21891.01s -> 21891.89s]  Maybe training?
[21892.53s -> 21896.53s]  Do I have to meet with her or something?
[21896.53s -> 21906.48s]  Is there another place for me to do that?
[21906.48s -> 21907.04s]  Roster?
[21907.04s -> 21907.28s]  No.
[21910.47s -> 21912.31s]  This loser only has one girlfriend.
[21912.95s -> 21919.09s]  Nah I don't need to do this.
[21919.09s -> 21922.04s]  All right that's uh I think that's a good stopping point for now.
[21922.04s -> 21923.16s]  She's in the roster.
[21923.80s -> 21927.70s]  You have to equip the sponsored stuff.
[21928.34s -> 21932.45s]  So it's not just on.
[21932.45s -> 21934.21s]  So this actually this has to be equipped.
[21937.40s -> 21937.80s]  You sure?
[21938.44s -> 21955.48s]  I don't think so.
[21956.20s -> 21962.21s]  Yeah it's not here.
[21963.25s -> 21964.36s]  I think it's just on.

[22001.64s -> 22002.52s]  85.
[22002.52s -> 22004.24s]  Yeah all right.
[22004.24s -> 22004.88s]  No I can't.
[22004.88s -> 22006.64s]  There's somebody on my team that's 85.
[22006.64s -> 22011.01s]  Then I can't do 69 either guys.
[22011.65s -> 22017.49s]  How about 50?
[22018.05s -> 22020.32s]  48.
[22020.32s -> 22023.04s]  48.
[22023.04s -> 22024.32s]  Yeah I think it's just already equipped.
[22025.76s -> 22026.88s]  But that's going to be it for tonight.
[22028.00s -> 22029.92s]  I am going to take the next couple days off.
[22030.56s -> 22033.60s]  We went three days in a row here.
[22033.60s -> 22035.44s]  So I was going to take one or two days off.
[22036.26s -> 22040.90s]  I got some stuff I need to take care of in the house.
[22042.52s -> 22047.32s]  So I will see you guys on say Sunday.
[22047.32s -> 22051.57s]  I will probably see you guys on Wednesday.
[22051.57s -> 22053.89s]  And I'm sorry to all the Ace Attorney fans.
[22056.20s -> 22060.23s]  But I kind of want I think I want to beat this.
[22062.42s -> 22063.38s]  It's so fun.
[22064.79s -> 22066.71s]  I had what a blast this was.
[22066.71s -> 22068.87s]  The last couple of streams is like Space Channel.
[22069.67s -> 22071.75s]  They've been great.
[22071.75s -> 22073.51s]  Not that not that other streams haven't been.
[22073.51s -> 22078.52s]  But game selection wise I think I've been having a lot of fun with the game selection.
[22078.52s -> 22080.36s]  The last like four or five straight.
[22080.36s -> 22086.20s]  Larry Resnick will two into like Crazy Taxi and Space Channel into this.
[22086.20s -> 22088.92s]  What a great selection of video games in the last two weeks.
[22091.97s -> 22095.09s]  After this Ace Attorney yes I will try to get that to work.
[22095.09s -> 22096.68s]  I'll get my audio splitter.
[22099.68s -> 22104.00s]  But that's going to be the end of tonight's stream.
[22104.88s -> 22110.52s]  So thank you all for watching.
[22112.56s -> 22113.68s]  Really appreciate it.
[22113.68s -> 22118.16s]  See you guys on Wednesday.
[22118.16s -> 22122.90s]  For those of you that came in late.
[22123.70s -> 22128.45s]  Yeah there's a you probably have no idea what this is.
[22128.45s -> 22129.65s]  But that's all right.
[22129.65s -> 22131.76s]  I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[22132.40s -> 22133.38s]  Thanks for joining me.
[22133.38s -> 22135.62s]  And Patriots won the Super Bowl.
[22135.62s -> 22141.59s]  That's I guess that's as a Boston and New England guy.
[22142.79s -> 22147.22s]  Tom Brady now can put a ring in every one of his bedrooms.
[22149.96s -> 22152.68s]  Implying that Tom Brady probably doesn't have like a 12 bedroom house.
[22152.68s -> 22154.44s]  So he has to win at least six more Super Bowls.
[22156.37s -> 22157.01s]  His bathrooms.
[22157.57s -> 22160.10s]  He probably doesn't have more than six bathrooms in his house right.
[22160.10s -> 22161.54s]  So we can have a ring in each bathroom.
[22162.18s -> 22166.68s]  They can just like hang it on the like on the shower or something.
[22166.68s -> 22170.85s]  But anyways let's go through the bits.
[22170.85s -> 22171.83s]  See you guys Wednesday.
[22171.83s -> 22173.35s]  Thanks for hanging out.
[22173.35s -> 22175.67s]  That was Blitz the League 2 for PlayStation 3.
[22176.39s -> 22178.68s]  It is a very very very fun game.
[22179.40s -> 22180.76s]  Highly recommended.
[22180.76s -> 22181.72s]  And we will complete it.
[22182.68s -> 22184.04s]  Hopefully on Wednesday.
[22185.04s -> 22186.16s]  And stadium seating.
[22186.16s -> 22187.52s]  Thanks for four dollars stadium seating.
[22188.08s -> 22191.12s]  Hey Jerm, I just want to say you've helped me through so much
[22191.12s -> 22193.28s]  throughout these past years whenever I'm feeling down.
[22193.28s -> 22194.88s]  I've always been able to tune into the streams.
[22195.76s -> 22198.24s]  Or watch your videos on the old channel and laugh.
[22198.24s -> 22199.76s]  And you've helped me through tons.

[22241.04s -> 22241.84s]  God damn it.

[22245.32s -> 22246.12s]  Something's what is it?

[22284.04s -> 22284.44s]  Just did it.
[22284.44s -> 22285.24s]  I clicked the two buttons.
[22285.88s -> 22287.09s]  Guys you don't understand.
[22287.09s -> 22289.49s]  There's a red button on on every desk I've ever owned.
[22289.49s -> 22291.49s]  That was delete all YouTube videos.
[22294.76s -> 22295.88s]  Every YouTuber has one.

[22316.79s -> 22319.83s]  Oh well and I got scammed out of like forty five thousand dollars.
[22320.55s -> 22328.20s]  Like they they're coming for like my secret codes.

[22342.31s -> 22343.51s]  Thank you Jess for the one dollar.
[22343.51s -> 22345.67s]  Could you give me a new username change?
[22346.31s -> 22347.44s]  I can't think of anything.
[22347.44s -> 22349.04s]  I want to keep the Jess part.
[22349.04s -> 22356.07s]  Um how about uh how about Jess you got it.
[22358.18s -> 22358.90s]  Jess you got it.

[22372.44s -> 22373.64s]  Laughing my ass off.
[22373.64s -> 22374.60s]  You don't know what I smell like.

[22383.80s -> 22386.36s]  Also I'm gonna be the big 20 tomorrow.
[22387.08s -> 22388.92s]  Can't believe I've made it this far.
[22388.92s -> 22389.88s]  Hope you have a great night.
[22389.88s -> 22390.60s]  Happy birthday.
[22391.56s -> 22394.60s]  Yeah probably not sure what time zone you're in but happy birthday.
[22396.87s -> 22397.67s]  Big 20.
[22398.39s -> 22398.87s]  Two zero.
[22400.82s -> 22402.18s]  Thank you so much Flugboy.
[22402.18s -> 22402.98s]  Hope you have a good one.
[22404.82s -> 22407.14s]  Thank you creation the cyborg for the one dollar.
[22407.14s -> 22409.78s]  Hey German my grandfather died on January 30th.
[22410.42s -> 22412.58s]  Even though I never met him I was able to see photos.
[22414.68s -> 22417.88s]  Also the Wii died on the 30th and I bought my last Wii game.
[22419.72s -> 22421.48s]  Have a great day and let the Super Bowl begin.
[22424.24s -> 22425.52s]  I'm terribly sorry to hear that.
[22431.38s -> 22432.66s]  Rest in peace to your grandfather.
[22434.18s -> 22434.90s]  Sorry to hear that.
[22435.46s -> 22438.82s]  But yeah the Super Bowl began the Super Bowl ended.
[22443.60s -> 22456.44s]  Patriots won.
[22456.44s -> 22458.36s]  Thank you Alec for the one dollar.
[22458.36s -> 22460.12s]  Hey German how do you like your steak cooked?
[22462.12s -> 22462.52s]  Medium.
[22463.08s -> 22466.55s]  Depending on what kind of cut of meat.
[22466.55s -> 22468.23s]  I don't really eat a whole lot of red meat.
[22468.23s -> 22472.66s]  I don't really eat a whole lot of steak because it upsets my stomach sometimes.
[22473.64s -> 22478.36s]  But like a medium to medium well depending on what the cut of meat it is.
[22482.39s -> 22485.11s]  But it's it's it for hamburgers though if you'd like a cheeseburger.
[22485.83s -> 22487.99s]  I liked my cheeseburgers cooked all the way through.
[22489.06s -> 22491.30s]  So if I get a steak I'd want it done medium.
[22491.30s -> 22495.14s]  But if I get a McDonald's hamburger it's not medium rare.
[22495.94s -> 22501.86s]  If I order a burger I usually just say whatever like you know medium or medium well.
[22501.86s -> 22505.14s]  But I like it usually cooked all the way through for a burger.
[22506.98s -> 22507.70s]  Medium wet.
[22511.94s -> 22516.82s]  So burgers medium well steak medium to chef's choice.
[22516.82s -> 22520.15s]  Hope that answers your question.
[22520.71s -> 22522.24s]  Tingy thanks for the one dollar.
[22522.24s -> 22523.92s]  The audio splitter got lost in the mail.
[22523.92s -> 22526.00s]  Probably got lost in the same place as the Pikachu socks.
[22527.06s -> 22528.18s]  Yeah I don't know something about the mail.
[22528.74s -> 22530.79s]  I don't know what it is mail.
[22531.59s -> 22532.60s]  Fucking mail.

[22541.32s -> 22543.56s]  Thank you Beck PNG for the one dollar.
[22543.56s -> 22545.48s]  Hey Jerma I'm here to force you to look at fan art.
[22546.36s -> 22546.76s]  Sorry.
[22547.94s -> 22548.66s]  Sorry what?
[22548.66s -> 22550.82s]  I wanted to make you something a little more polished in color.
[22550.82s -> 22552.18s]  So here's there's here it is.
[22552.74s -> 22555.00s]  You stream the perfect background noise for drawing.
[22555.00s -> 22557.64s]  Though sometimes I end up laughing so hard I can't see the screen.
[22557.64s -> 22558.44s]  Thanks for that.
[22558.44s -> 22560.76s]  Also you need to know your hair is extremely fun to draw.
[22561.80s -> 22563.32s]  As is the rest of you.
[22563.32s -> 22564.52s]  Keep up the clownery.
[22567.40s -> 22567.96s]  Look at that.
[22571.30s -> 22576.24s]  All right they're like here I'm gonna put this like.
[22580.55s -> 22581.51s]  Look at this.

[22600.58s -> 22602.50s]  I want to get it on the screen.

[22628.08s -> 22633.99s]  I gotta turn this off.
[22633.99s -> 22634.63s]  Hold on.
[22634.63s -> 22639.20s]  I gotta put my gotta put my feet in the microwave.
[22639.20s -> 22639.68s]  There we go.
[22640.32s -> 22645.99s]  There it is.
[22646.63s -> 22654.85s]  Why would you do that?
[22655.49s -> 22657.19s]  Take a look at that.
[22657.91s -> 22662.56s]  This is this is just wonderful.
[22663.20s -> 22666.55s]  You guys are so talented.
[22667.19s -> 22671.57s]  Yeah make sure we get the Beck PNG right there.
[22672.29s -> 22679.43s]  This is like Jerma is Jerma the Disney character.
[22680.31s -> 22683.35s]  It's got that like old school Disney animated feel.
[22683.35s -> 22683.75s]  I love it.
[22684.47s -> 22695.04s]  Well done.
[22695.04s -> 22696.36s]  Thank you so much Beck.
[22697.00s -> 22703.59s]  That is absolutely phenomenal.
[22703.59s -> 22703.91s]  Thank you.
[22708.00s -> 22709.60s]  Now you're gonna be in Kingdom Hearts.
[22710.16s -> 22714.80s]  Yeah that's Beck PNG.
[22714.80s -> 22715.84s]  I don't know if Beck if you have.
[22717.44s -> 22719.68s]  Because you linked me like a Google Drive.
[22719.68s -> 22722.24s]  I don't know if you have a art page or something.
[22722.24s -> 22724.00s]  But go ahead if you if you have it link it.
[22724.64s -> 22727.81s]  But thank you.
[22729.86s -> 22731.46s]  Fantastic stuff.
[22732.26s -> 22736.37s]  Thank you Mr. Sneak Man for the dollar 30.
[22737.01s -> 22741.28s]  Hey Jerma been getting a lot of Dunkin Donuts ice coffees in the last three years
[22741.28s -> 22745.44s]  and I want and I want you to know that the one birthday TF2 video where you drank
[22745.44s -> 22749.12s]  blueberry iced coffee fueled my iced coffee spendings for three years and counting.
[22749.68s -> 22753.84s]  I especially like the five percent of the time when the coffee actually tastes good.
[22754.72s -> 22756.08s]  Favorite flavor of coffee.
[22756.80s -> 22759.80s]  Well that that's Dunkin Donuts.
[22760.68s -> 22764.68s]  Dunkin Donuts is like a doll of 60 for a coffee.
[22764.68s -> 22766.36s]  For like a medium iced coffee right.
[22767.16s -> 22768.48s]  But it's Dunkin Donuts.
[22771.32s -> 22773.80s]  My favorite flavor of Dunkin Donuts is blueberry.
[22774.96s -> 22776.80s]  Just that's what I used to drink it all the time.
[22777.89s -> 22783.78s]  But now I'm more of a I think I'm more of a classical English toffee kind of guy now.
[22784.58s -> 22792.52s]  But there you go.
[22793.08s -> 22796.48s]  Dunkin Donuts I do miss Dunkin Donuts though.
[22797.04s -> 22799.86s]  It was just so easy to grab like a fucking dunks
[22800.50s -> 22803.27s]  because he knew nobody was going to give a shit.
[22803.27s -> 22805.27s]  It's like oh he's just drinking dunks.
[22806.15s -> 22806.71s]  It sucks.
[22807.43s -> 22811.43s]  But everybody it's good because there's no expectations and it's just delicious.
[22812.07s -> 22816.44s]  It is the it is like such a low expectation.
[22817.40s -> 22820.12s]  Cheap comfort drink I think.
[22820.84s -> 22825.80s]  I'm not even sure there's a Dunkin Donuts in Las Vegas.
[22826.44s -> 22830.28s]  I don't think I've even looked but I haven't seen them.
[22830.92s -> 22840.47s]  They're not as prevalent as they are in Massachusetts that's for sure.
[22841.27s -> 22846.77s]  But thank you Mr. Sneakman.
[22846.77s -> 22848.37s]  Thank you Divus for the two bucks.
[22848.93s -> 22851.00s]  Divus always coming in with a feud.
[22851.00s -> 22852.36s]  Holla's every stream.
[22852.36s -> 22853.00s]  Thank you Divus.
[22854.37s -> 22856.29s]  Grimoire for the five dollars and five cents.
[22856.29s -> 22856.93s]  Thank you Grimoire.
[22857.57s -> 22860.85s]  Hey Jerma I work at a vet in Vegas and like a year ago
[22860.85s -> 22863.65s]  when you announced your move I dreamed that I saw Otto at work
[22864.21s -> 22869.41s]  and instantly recognized him because I've seen Otto's big adventure one and two dozens of times.
[22877.38s -> 22877.86s]  What?
[22877.86s -> 22878.98s]  Wait we're spamming a link here?
[22878.98s -> 22879.46s]  What's going on?
[22880.18s -> 22881.17s]  This is another.
[22886.04s -> 22889.32s]  I would put this on the stream but I don't I want people to be able to go to bed tonight.
[22890.04s -> 22897.04s]  You know I would really love it if people could like be able to go to sleep tonight.
[22901.06s -> 22902.50s]  I can't even like save this link.
[22903.06s -> 22904.82s]  This link is like unsavable.
[22905.46s -> 22907.60s]  It's a video.
[22909.96s -> 22911.48s]  This is this is an mp4.
[22912.20s -> 22914.32s]  How do I pull an mp what?
[22915.12s -> 22925.49s]  Let's see if I can get this on the screen.
[22925.49s -> 22936.69s]  I apologize to anybody that oh wanted to go to sleep because here is here's a strange video.
[22950.77s -> 22953.57s]  It's over on both monitors now and it's freaking me out.
[22953.57s -> 22954.37s]  I have to take it off.
[22958.55s -> 22960.63s]  That's my transition into the green goblin.
[22963.51s -> 22964.15s]  Holy hell.
[22966.60s -> 22967.56s]  But thank you Grimoire.
[22969.60s -> 22971.04s]  Las local Las Vegas vet.
[22975.57s -> 22976.69s]  Little Otto.
[22976.69s -> 22980.63s]  Hey robot mentality thanks for the five dollars blood for the blood god.
[22981.27s -> 22983.64s]  Thank you for the five dollars.
[22983.64s -> 22987.78s]  I'm something of a goblin myself yeah.
[22987.78s -> 22990.82s]  Hey scar thanks for the one dollar so I'm not sure if I should tell you this
[22991.46s -> 22994.74s]  but this man approached me and said he was a top 1000 streamer or something
[22994.74s -> 22996.66s]  and he threatened to snap my back in half.
[22999.86s -> 23004.02s]  It's just that fucking image of my face and that it's that's it's like this one.
[23004.02s -> 23004.82s]  No it's this one.
[23004.82s -> 23005.78s]  It's this one.
[23005.78s -> 23006.74s]  It's this one.
[23006.74s -> 23007.62s]  It's this one.
[23007.62s -> 23008.90s]  It's not that one it's this one.
[23009.54s -> 23013.32s]  But with like the other guy's face whatever.
[23014.53s -> 23015.17s]  That didn't happen.
[23018.56s -> 23021.20s]  I made the original one and the reverse one.
[23021.20s -> 23022.72s]  This is so fucked up.
[23031.76s -> 23033.52s]  This one doesn't this looks like a different person.
[23034.87s -> 23036.87s]  All the other ones have looked like me
[23036.87s -> 23040.31s]  but it's weird how the bottom of my face doesn't even look like a face.
[23041.03s -> 23044.32s]  This doesn't even look like it could be me.
[23045.04s -> 23047.81s]  This is some weird cousin.
[23056.26s -> 23059.22s]  Thank you scar for your multiple manipulations of photos.
[23060.20s -> 23061.08s]  Thank you.
[23061.08s -> 23067.00s]  We also have Freudian weapon five dollars.
[23067.72s -> 23069.56s]  Thank you Freudian weapon.
[23070.12s -> 23071.08s]  Appreciate the five dollars.
[23074.47s -> 23075.11s]  Code man.
[23075.11s -> 23076.39s]  Thank you code man for the one dollar.
[23076.39s -> 23079.03s]  German looking like Handsome Jack from Borderlands 2.
[23079.67s -> 23087.06s]  Borderlands 2.
[23087.06s -> 23088.50s]  Thank you smarky.
[23089.14s -> 23090.66s]  Thank you smarky for the five dollars.
[23090.66s -> 23092.26s]  German I didn't know you were in a band.
[23103.48s -> 23105.16s]  What is this band?
[23109.06s -> 23110.34s]  What band is this?
[23110.34s -> 23121.48s]  Is that um I don't know what band that is.
[23122.12s -> 23124.50s]  Booger eating stream.
[23124.50s -> 23125.30s]  Why did I read that?
[23126.10s -> 23130.02s]  They did a song on Tony Hawk 2.
[23130.02s -> 23130.58s]  Oh okay.
[23132.77s -> 23134.05s]  Lit bulb thanks for the one dollar.
[23134.05s -> 23136.37s]  Oh I get it because today is the Super Bowl.
[23137.25s -> 23138.69s]  Yeah see there you go.
[23138.69s -> 23139.17s]  You got it.
[23139.81s -> 23140.92s]  You get it see.
[23142.60s -> 23147.08s]  And a Wednesday is not the Super Bowl but we're playing it again.
[23147.64s -> 23150.48s]  This is a four day long Super Bowl routine.
[23154.85s -> 23156.69s]  Thank you creation the cyborg for the one dollar.
[23156.69s -> 23158.45s]  I promise I will get the internet box.
[23159.17s -> 23167.78s]  I have no idea what you're talking about but thank you for the one dollar.
[23168.74s -> 23169.94s]  Timmy Timtan thanks for the one dollar.
[23169.94s -> 23171.94s]  Video games really do make people violent Jeremy.
[23171.94s -> 23174.50s]  You're gonna go run down to the Super Bowl
[23175.84s -> 23177.20s]  and punch no.
[23179.30s -> 23181.22s]  Thank you flank tank for the three dollars.
[23181.22s -> 23182.58s]  Now the Dreamcast is over.
[23183.30s -> 23186.98s]  Ever think you would do Nintendo 64 set of streams?
[23188.42s -> 23193.22s]  Some 90s Nintendo nostalgia if you ever do my vote is for Kirby 64
[23193.22s -> 23196.58s]  excluding the obvious Mario, DK, and Goldeneye.
[23199.52s -> 23203.28s]  Yeah I think all the old consoles should show up eventually
[23203.92s -> 23206.48s]  but I think we really need to take a break from them once they're done
[23207.65s -> 23212.13s]  because there's so many games to play
[23212.13s -> 23213.97s]  and so many things to see on the old consoles
[23216.42s -> 23218.82s]  that I don't want to just all right Dreamcast
[23218.82s -> 23221.14s]  we just played like 15 Dreamcast games.
[23221.70s -> 23223.30s]  Bring on the 64 next week.
[23223.86s -> 23226.53s]  I'd like to do them maybe once every six months to a year.
[23228.34s -> 23231.86s]  So because the last time we did the when we did the big PlayStation 2 and
[23235.00s -> 23237.16s]  PlayStation 3 I mean this is a PS3 game
[23237.16s -> 23240.44s]  but this is obviously this I played this game for six hours today
[23242.82s -> 23247.94s]  but usually once like every six to twelve months or so I like to really
[23247.94s -> 23252.18s]  because it is expensive too you know I think just get emulator
[23252.18s -> 23255.70s]  but I really I'd rather I'd rather play it the way it's intended to be played.
[23257.03s -> 23264.31s]  So you know buying a Dreamcast in 15 games I mean that's it's I think the total bill
[23264.87s -> 23268.31s]  for the Dreamcast stuff was at least like seven or eight hundred dollars for everything
[23268.95s -> 23274.36s]  so you can't really I can't really do those like once a week
[23276.85s -> 23281.89s]  GameCube like the plate I've spent probably thousands of dollars over the last couple years
[23281.89s -> 23285.12s]  on just old console stuff.
[23285.12s -> 23289.97s]  Sega CD those were very expensive just because they're so old and rare.
[23289.97s -> 23296.13s]  That's a lot of bits.
[23296.77s -> 23303.36s]  Do I still have the Sega CD?
[23304.16s -> 23304.96s]  Uh I do.
[23305.84s -> 23308.32s]  I do it's in a box somewhere do I?
[23308.96s -> 23313.76s]  I think it's in like a box somewhere did I get rid of it maybe I did.
[23314.48s -> 23318.56s]  Stop flexing.
[23319.12s -> 23324.82s]  No well I'm just explaining why um on top of I don't want to just have every
[23326.52s -> 23329.56s]  those streams are really fun to do and they're really fun
[23329.56s -> 23331.64s]  but once they're done they're done.
[23332.36s -> 23336.24s]  You know if you do like let's go back and play a bunch of random 64 games
[23336.24s -> 23340.98s]  there we go here it is all right that we I can't really do that again
[23340.98s -> 23344.26s]  you know it's pretty much a one hand a poker.
[23346.77s -> 23348.93s]  Now there are some great games that I maybe want to play through
[23348.93s -> 23351.25s]  but once you play through them that they're it's it they're over.
[23353.94s -> 23358.42s]  Like for instance Dreamcast I can't like go back and do Space Channel 5 part 2
[23359.68s -> 23362.96s]  that it's done it was a three or four hour experience and that's it.
[23362.96s -> 23367.30s]  So I want to like save them for uh times when I know that I want to complete something
[23367.30s -> 23374.39s]  or when I want to do it full week dedicated for N64.
[23374.39s -> 23377.51s]  I kind of did that for Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 we did Dreamcast games
[23377.51s -> 23387.01s]  for like three streams in a row or at least three out of the four
[23387.01s -> 23389.25s]  and there are some experiences that I didn't get a hand of
[23390.20s -> 23393.48s]  that I want to do still for some of those old consoles.
[23393.48s -> 23398.79s]  There's still PlayStation 2 games behind me that I never did just kind of ran out of
[23398.79s -> 23404.74s]  time slots to put them in but yes N64 you will definitely see it eventually
[23404.74s -> 23412.32s]  I just can't really tell you when but thank you Flank Tank for the three dollars as well.
[23412.32s -> 23415.81s]  Hey creation the cyborg thanks for the one dollar it's 9.43
[23416.69s -> 23423.89s]  meaning not a lot of time of time for what am I missing something here?
[23429.70s -> 23433.06s]  Thank you Dirty Margaret for the one dollar I really thought you were going to lose to Detroit.
[23433.80s -> 23440.96s]  Jax does it again uh thank you creation the cyborg for the two dollars here
[23441.60s -> 23451.24s]  uh you missed a Sega Dreamcast exclusive uh Star Wars collection on Etsy for 15 dollars
[23451.24s -> 23454.76s]  do not get Halo for the Dreamcast it sucks.
[23455.48s -> 23464.37s]  They did a halo for the Dreamcast they did like a modded halo for Dreamcast
[23470.39s -> 23476.71s]  well uh is it like an is it like a black market Etsy video game modded community?
[23477.35s -> 23490.82s]  Do people make like Dreamcast games still is it is this that's pretty interesting I didn't
[23490.82s -> 23498.40s]  even know that but I think like the old console stuff is probably done uh for Dreamcast at least
[23498.40s -> 23505.11s]  like for a while probably revisit revisited is neither this name sneak I don't know what the
[23505.11s -> 23512.16s]  sneak means um but the last sentence didn't come out correctly the key was in the lock
[23512.72s -> 23515.44s]  but the key wasn't all the way in and I turned it anyways and I couldn't turn the
[23515.44s -> 23521.48s]  door and open the door so the key went back in all the way and I was able to unlock the door
[23521.48s -> 23526.74s]  we're fine uh thank you Dr. Clay for the one dollar if you're looking for a recent
[23526.74s -> 23532.02s]  modern blitz type game you should try out the mutant league football it's on steam and switch
[23532.02s -> 23544.31s]  is it like this because if it's like blitz I would definitely give it a try
[23545.11s -> 23548.15s]  now isn't there like a turn-based football game is that what this is
[23548.87s -> 23554.88s]  I know this is a turn-based kind of like x-com football game isn't there
[23559.43s -> 23568.69s]  is that what this is so it's not like kind of madden style with you know passing and running
[23568.69s -> 23577.72s]  with the analog it's more of like a strategy game right no okay so mutant league football
[23577.72s -> 23584.80s]  is different okay so that's blood bowl okay I will definitely check it out because I love
[23584.80s -> 23594.74s]  blitz blood blow is the warhammer one okay yeah that makes sense uh thank you to

[23603.30s -> 23606.90s]  you to know that the success I've had couldn't have come without your inspiration and motivation
[23607.46s -> 23611.78s]  it's already gained nearly 7 000 followers in just a few months and I know it doesn't seem
[23611.78s -> 23616.26s]  like many followers yes that's a lot but it really feels like once in my life I have a
[23616.26s -> 23620.18s]  serious influence in voice and things I care about anyways love you germa if you want to

[23663.91s -> 23669.88s]  because I remember the bigs being one of my favorite baseball games we'll see one game at
[23669.88s -> 23681.36s]  a time but thank you uh kaylor me a moto and congratulations on the followers and

[23961.84s -> 23967.44s]  day thank you so much uh bro luck thanks for the five dollars and 15 cents I can't believe
[23967.44s -> 23976.98s]  you admitted this on stream I promise it's not a snort I did purchase seaman and the mic
[23977.86s -> 23987.92s]  I did I I bought seaman and the mic and the mic didn't come in the box so I had to return it
[23988.56s -> 23992.93s]  and I have to even check to make sure that I got like the credit for that because that was
[23992.93s -> 23999.03s]  fucking expensive that was almost a hundred dollars yes you heard me right you cannot buy
[23999.83s -> 24007.91s]  seaman or the mic the mic for the dreamcast is like 80 dollars and it's the only way you can
[24007.91s -> 24013.80s]  play these games on dreamcast that was a hundred fucking dollar purchase it's so rare apparently
[24019.24s -> 24024.84s]  seaman is expensive incredibly for some reason the disc isn't but when they bunt they they get
[24024.84s -> 24031.73s]  you just buy the disc why would you sell just the disc maybe I guess maybe if you
[24031.81s -> 24042.23s]  assume that you just have the microphone nobody has that the game requires a lot of time too I
[24042.23s -> 24045.35s]  figured maybe we could spend a long time on it at least like a few hours on stream
[24046.07s -> 24053.91s]  desperately trying to make a fish friend but we'll have to wait uh always make you always
[24053.91s -> 24060.18s]  check your amazon orders because that was two out of I believe 14 purchases that weren't correct
[24060.98s -> 24064.98s]  they either were missing items yeah they were just missed disc one not in stupid invaders
[24066.34s -> 24073.78s]  and mike not in box clearly explicitly stating mike included I wouldn't have paid that much money
