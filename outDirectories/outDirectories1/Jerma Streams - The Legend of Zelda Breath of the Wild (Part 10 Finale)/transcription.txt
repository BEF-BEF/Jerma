[50.34s -> 52.56s]  What's up?
[52.56s -> 60.04s]  I'm seeing a lot of people in chat that we're maybe in a betting mood, potentially, one of the mods told me.
[64.91s -> 67.15s]  If you don't know, you're just getting here.
[68.24s -> 71.74s]  Today is a very, very, very special day for a lot of people here.
[74.02s -> 79.27s]  Today is the day that I beat Breath of the Wild.
[80.50s -> 83.08s]  Wow, didn't think you're going to hear that on a Sunday afternoon, did you?
[88.42s -> 89.60s]  It's been about four months.
[89.92s -> 92.56s]  I think the last time was, what, May, April?
[94.90s -> 96.66s]  So I haven't played in four months.
[96.74s -> 104.08s]  I got one, it's been five months, whatever, it's been more like six.
[106.24s -> 107.06s]  Well, all right, here's the thing.
[107.86s -> 110.02s]  I've got one more divine beast.
[112.46s -> 113.30s]  Kill that bastard.
[114.32s -> 115.12s]  Wait, no, you don't kill them.
[115.80s -> 117.32s]  It's been like five months since I played this.
[117.72s -> 118.72s]  We become friends.
[119.08s -> 121.04s]  I'm not going to, we're not killing any, any divine beasts.
[123.44s -> 125.36s]  I have, I forgot that that was, okay.
[125.40s -> 126.32s]  I forgot everything.
[126.48s -> 126.98s]  Apparently.
[128.32s -> 131.12s]  We're going to team up with the divine beast to take out Ganon.
[131.52s -> 132.02s]  That's better.
[135.95s -> 140.26s]  But, uh, I asked how long this would take to do.
[143.18s -> 147.93s]  If I beat the divine beast, I become friends with the divine beast.
[151.55s -> 152.51s]  Then go right to Ganon.
[153.39s -> 154.51s]  Could I do it in three hours?
[156.46s -> 157.98s]  And that is what you'll be betting on today.
[159.40s -> 160.44s]  We'll see if I can do it.
[162.65s -> 167.31s]  Can I beat this game in under three hours, three hours in one second?
[168.93s -> 170.09s]  Absolutely not.
[170.13s -> 171.37s]  I'm seeing a few absolutely not.
[172.74s -> 173.30s]  No way.
[173.30s -> 173.82s]  No way.
[173.82s -> 174.46s]  Absolutely not.
[177.64s -> 179.04s]  Well, I'm going to try anyways.
[182.35s -> 183.43s]  How long are you going to be live for?
[183.43s -> 183.71s]  I don't know.
[183.71s -> 184.27s]  That's a good question.
[189.73s -> 189.93s]  All right.
[189.93s -> 194.37s]  So if I don't get there and three hours, this, this is the last time I'm ever
[194.37s -> 195.21s]  going to play Breath of the Wild.
[196.21s -> 197.65s]  So it's either I beat the game or not.
[198.76s -> 200.76s]  I have to, I'm, I'm confident I'll do it.
[204.76s -> 205.84s]  No chance.
[207.35s -> 208.19s]  That's kind of, okay.
[208.19s -> 212.87s]  What if I get to the front door of Ganon and I aim the magical holy bow and I'm
[212.87s -> 216.39s]  about to shoot the first shot and it's three hours goes up and I exit the game.
[224.27s -> 224.83s]  That'd be kind of funny.
[228.69s -> 228.93s]  Yeah.
[228.97s -> 234.27s]  But after this, I'm going to play Breath of the Wild for at most three hours.
[237.08s -> 238.40s]  Then we're going to move on.
[238.88s -> 239.92s]  I want to play Punch Out.
[240.56s -> 241.72s]  I want to play Goldeneye too.
[244.08s -> 246.36s]  But Goldeneye, they, they re-released it.
[246.36s -> 247.72s]  They made it HD.
[247.72s -> 250.84s]  Well, they didn't make it HD graphics, but they made it upscaled it, right?
[253.19s -> 254.27s]  I want to play a bunch of Switch stuff.
[255.15s -> 256.07s]  It's plugged in.
[256.07s -> 256.99s]  It's being captured.
[256.99s -> 257.51s]  So I'm going to do it.
[261.26s -> 262.02s]  So what do you think?
[262.02s -> 263.42s]  Should we, should we go for a countdown?
[264.87s -> 266.03s]  Wait, I need to get ready first.
[270.56s -> 274.85s]  It's got a huge raid right at the very beginning.
[276.81s -> 277.33s]  Holy shit.
[277.45s -> 277.93s]  Thanks for the raid.
[278.53s -> 284.78s]  There's over 2000 people.
[285.70s -> 286.22s]  What's up?
[289.38s -> 290.22s]  Is it K4?
[290.90s -> 291.82s]  Thanks for the raid K4.
[296.66s -> 297.18s]  Welcome everybody.
[299.58s -> 300.22s]  It's a lot of people.
[301.45s -> 302.77s]  We're going to be playing Breath of the Wild.
[304.96s -> 305.80s]  Face cam off.
[307.03s -> 307.75s]  No, no face cam.
[310.38s -> 311.14s]  Put a timer up.
[311.18s -> 311.38s]  Yeah.
[311.38s -> 312.58s]  Well, don't worry.
[312.58s -> 314.62s]  We'll, we'll make sure we're very honest about this.
[320.51s -> 321.47s]  Face cam or riot.
[322.94s -> 325.89s]  Well, ain't going to be one.
[325.89s -> 326.97s]  So that's too bad.
[333.30s -> 334.38s]  Why does it have to be three hours?
[334.38s -> 334.94s]  Exactly.
[335.14s -> 337.18s]  Cause I think that's in pre-stream chat.
[337.18s -> 341.06s]  That's where we kind of all were like, well, some people said it's you.
[341.38s -> 345.74s]  So it'll be five hours, but I disagree.
[346.50s -> 351.65s]  I think I can do it in three and I'm not rushing to do this, but I, I kind of am
[352.25s -> 354.97s]  because I, I keep putting off Breath of the Wild.
[354.97s -> 355.97s]  I keep saying, I'm going to play it.
[355.97s -> 356.97s]  I keep saying, Hey, I'll do it.
[356.97s -> 357.29s]  I'll do it.
[357.29s -> 357.57s]  I'll do it.
[357.57s -> 358.09s]  I just don't do it.
[360.42s -> 361.70s]  I have to get myself a timer.
[364.83s -> 365.51s]  Plus that's kind of fun.
[368.52s -> 370.80s]  I'm going to fall off the horse a hundred times in three hours.
[370.80s -> 371.84s]  And I'm not gonna make any progress.
[371.84s -> 372.24s]  So don't worry.
[374.39s -> 376.43s]  Those of you that are betting, if I can see, all right.
[376.47s -> 380.22s]  Is it just see the end credits in three hours?
[384.76s -> 386.12s]  He hates this game.
[389.31s -> 389.71s]  No, I did.
[389.71s -> 390.11s]  I don't.
[390.11s -> 391.35s]  I love Breath of the Wild.
[391.51s -> 392.19s]  Zelda.
[392.19s -> 393.23s]  Let's go.
[393.23s -> 393.51s]  Yeah.
[393.51s -> 394.39s]  It's so much fun.
[394.43s -> 397.15s]  I'm going to give myself a three hour timer to finish this game and I'm
[397.15s -> 398.19s]  never playing it ever again.
[399.98s -> 401.58s]  Oh, Nintendo.
[401.58s -> 402.18s]  Let's go.
[405.30s -> 406.38s]  Well, I give myself a timer.
[406.38s -> 407.10s]  I think it's just fun.
[409.70s -> 410.18s]  You guys ready?
[410.90s -> 412.86s]  It's the last hit on the final boss.
[412.94s -> 413.38s]  Okay.
[413.66s -> 417.50s]  So by the way, today is the backseat dream.
[419.16s -> 421.44s]  You just, I don't want to name emote only ever.
[422.24s -> 423.64s]  I'm going to be looking for solutions.
[423.64s -> 424.84s]  I'm going to be asking for help.
[424.84s -> 428.44s]  I'm going to say, Hey, what's the best product I could use right now.
[429.08s -> 430.00s]  And I expect help.
[430.04s -> 431.04s]  I expect to get through this.
[433.99s -> 434.87s]  We're looking for the best products.
[434.91s -> 437.39s]  We're looking for the best, um, equipment.
[438.78s -> 439.34s]  That's cheating.
[439.42s -> 439.78s]  That's fine.
[442.33s -> 442.53s]  All right.
[442.53s -> 442.97s]  Are we ready?
[442.97s -> 444.13s]  Are we ready to play this?
[445.90s -> 449.46s]  So I get five minutes of streamer.
[450.34s -> 451.86s]  Learn how to play the whole game again.
[451.86s -> 453.02s]  Cause you haven't played it in six months.
[453.70s -> 455.54s]  I get five minutes to run around in a circle and jump.
[456.18s -> 456.78s]  You understand?
[457.26s -> 457.70s]  Okay.
[461.15s -> 461.75s]  I get that.
[464.12s -> 467.28s]  So that timer, I'm just going to run around in a circle for a few minutes.
[467.36s -> 467.96s]  No emote.
[467.96s -> 469.16s]  Only all backseating.
[469.96s -> 470.16s]  Yeah.
[470.72s -> 471.68s]  You can backseat as much as you want.
[473.85s -> 474.93s]  Hey, let me remember how to play.
[476.95s -> 477.39s]  That's jump.
[478.07s -> 478.47s]  We're going.
[479.15s -> 479.43s]  All right.
[479.59s -> 480.19s]  That's jump.
[481.28s -> 482.12s]  Isn't there a triple jump?
[482.24s -> 488.97s]  Can't you go like, I'm just trying to make as much people leave as possible
[489.21s -> 490.01s]  in the first 10 minutes.
[491.79s -> 495.03s]  I'm just trying to get as many people to leave as possible in the first five
[495.03s -> 495.15s]  minutes.
[496.26s -> 497.06s]  You said the same thing twice.
[500.84s -> 502.80s]  No, that way that's in tears of the kingdom.
[508.38s -> 508.62s]  All right.
[508.66s -> 510.98s]  The timer does not start until I say it does.
[511.02s -> 511.38s]  Okay.
[513.65s -> 516.13s]  And we're going to keep, I have a, I'm keeping track over here.
[517.98s -> 518.18s]  All right.
[518.18s -> 520.42s]  That's, this is sprint slash.
[520.46s -> 520.66s]  Okay.
[520.66s -> 522.90s]  I got, I got the master sword last time.
[523.78s -> 525.74s]  This thing is unbreakable, right?
[526.78s -> 531.27s]  Let's put a timer on screen.
[531.75s -> 535.47s]  I don't want to put a timer on screen because I feel like it'll ruin the VOD.
[538.05s -> 538.53s]  They're okay.
[538.61s -> 541.29s]  Every VOD before this did not have a three hour timer.
[541.45s -> 544.49s]  And the people that watch the VODs and they're just trying to hang out and just
[544.49s -> 544.77s]  chill.
[544.77s -> 545.77s]  Like, Oh, cool.
[545.81s -> 547.01s]  What's this timer on the screen?
[547.01s -> 549.17s]  I want to watch the streamer play breath of the wild.
[549.33s -> 549.85s]  What is this?
[551.36s -> 552.20s]  No, he ruined it.
[552.20s -> 553.36s]  He ruined the playthrough.
[553.36s -> 554.52s]  You ruined the playthrough.
[556.00s -> 556.64s]  I don't want to hear that.
[560.87s -> 561.07s]  All right.
[561.07s -> 561.87s]  That's how you, right.
[561.87s -> 563.27s]  You got, I got the freezing.
[563.27s -> 564.07s]  I got the camera.
[564.07s -> 565.47s]  I've got the magnet.
[566.19s -> 568.03s]  That's a jump swing.
[568.03s -> 569.39s]  The master sword can't be broken.
[569.39s -> 570.67s]  Thank God we finally got it.
[570.67s -> 570.95s]  All right.
[570.95s -> 572.11s]  So this is the thunder blade.
[574.82s -> 580.30s]  So if this is going to be truly the last breath of the wild stream, you better
[580.30s -> 581.66s]  believe I'm going to be throwing these people.
[581.66s -> 583.26s]  Like I'm going to be, this is awesome.
[583.30s -> 584.46s]  I'm so happy about this.
[586.19s -> 589.15s]  Me saying this is the last time I'm going to play play breath of the wild.
[590.51s -> 593.03s]  I now the whole, everything is now open.
[593.03s -> 595.35s]  Now I'm just going to use this weapon because I feel like it.
[596.98s -> 597.98s]  That's so awesome.
[597.98s -> 598.98s]  I'm so happy about that.
[600.42s -> 600.98s]  I don't even care.
[600.98s -> 601.78s]  I don't even know what this is.
[601.78s -> 602.50s]  I'm going to use it now.
[604.14s -> 604.86s]  I finally am.
[604.86s -> 607.54s]  I'm going to, I'm allowed to use all these weapons because I know it's the
[607.54s -> 608.38s]  last time I'm going to play it.
[611.88s -> 612.56s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[612.56s -> 613.24s]  The timer started.
[615.47s -> 615.91s]  Wait, the timer.
[615.91s -> 617.83s]  Oh, I, I, uh, timer started.
[617.83s -> 618.11s]  Hold on.
[619.26s -> 619.42s]  All right.
[619.42s -> 619.86s]  I know how to jump.
[620.02s -> 620.26s]  All right.
[620.26s -> 620.46s]  All right.
[620.46s -> 620.70s]  All right.
[620.70s -> 621.14s]  Right, right, right.
[622.42s -> 623.42s]  Here's what I, here's what I need to do.
[625.61s -> 627.09s]  Oh, wait, let me, let me turn this in first.
[628.33s -> 628.97s]  It's a question.
[630.37s -> 630.69s]  No, no.
[630.69s -> 631.41s]  Three, two, one.
[631.41s -> 631.65s]  Go.
[631.65s -> 632.01s]  Hold on.
[632.01s -> 632.65s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[634.02s -> 635.10s]  435.
[638.68s -> 639.32s]  Let me turn this down.
[639.32s -> 640.44s]  No, I have to turn this question.
[644.10s -> 645.58s]  A lot of people don't think I'm going to do this.
[645.62s -> 648.98s]  I cannot wait until you all get this completely wrong.
[650.85s -> 651.81s]  Skip the dialogue.
[652.37s -> 653.81s]  No, it hasn't officially started yet.
[655.43s -> 656.63s]  You want a different outcome this time?
[656.63s -> 656.95s]  Okay.
[657.39s -> 657.75s]  All right.
[659.34s -> 660.46s]  I think we have a cut scene here.
[664.00s -> 665.04s]  I am not going to fail.
[668.04s -> 668.20s]  Okay.
[668.20s -> 668.80s]  How strange.
[669.79s -> 670.47s]  Please beat it.
[670.47s -> 671.11s]  Please.
[675.39s -> 676.59s]  I give you five extra minutes.
[676.63s -> 677.11s]  Oh, okay.
[677.11s -> 677.31s]  Okay.
[677.31s -> 678.03s]  No, we're good.
[678.03s -> 678.27s]  We're good.
[681.46s -> 683.02s]  You wore that champion's tunic every day.
[683.02s -> 684.94s]  I feel as though I've been transported in time.
[685.54s -> 687.38s]  Link, our princess, you must rescue her.
[687.38s -> 687.58s]  All right.
[687.58s -> 691.08s]  So where's the, what, what is this a quest for?
[692.32s -> 693.68s]  I'm really glad you gave me that extra time.
[694.77s -> 697.77s]  You may not remember your last meeting with Ganon, but it did not end well for you.
[699.42s -> 700.46s]  Why, why is this a quest?
[702.44s -> 703.12s]  Upstairs?
[703.52s -> 705.64s]  Backseat as much as possible, by the way.
[707.65s -> 711.33s]  The shit that would get you banned in other chats of just like telling me where to go.
[712.05s -> 712.77s]  Oh, I want it all.
[712.89s -> 713.45s]  I want to see.
[713.45s -> 717.01s]  I want to, uh, anything that you would, we're talking backseat is open.
[717.01s -> 718.09s]  The floodgates are completely open.
[722.22s -> 724.50s]  I want exact coordinates to every single encounter.
[727.65s -> 728.49s]  What is this quest?
[733.42s -> 734.62s]  Captured memories.
[736.00s -> 736.48s]  What is this?
[738.46s -> 739.38s]  Captured memories.
[739.82s -> 742.42s]  Princess Zelda left behind an album with 12 pictures in it.
[743.66s -> 747.22s]  Traveling to the places shown in these pictures may help you regain your memories.
[747.54s -> 747.70s]  What?
[750.01s -> 750.37s]  Why is this?
[750.49s -> 752.77s]  Oh, but that was, that was like set as a destination.
[752.77s -> 754.13s]  I just wasted five minutes.
[756.03s -> 757.71s]  Why was that set as a destination?
[758.55s -> 758.83s]  Okay.
[758.83s -> 759.43s]  Well, what time is it?
[759.95s -> 760.15s]  All right.
[760.23s -> 761.03s]  We didn't even start it yet.
[765.23s -> 766.19s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, go back.
[766.19s -> 766.39s]  Go back.
[766.39s -> 766.67s]  Go back.
[766.95s -> 769.19s]  Ignore everything, but go to the top left of the map.
[769.23s -> 769.83s]  Ignore this.
[772.54s -> 773.02s]  Where's all right.
[773.02s -> 773.50s]  Where's the beast?
[774.54s -> 776.74s]  Where's the, I don't, the next beast is not on the map.
[776.78s -> 777.50s]  Where is the beast?
[781.05s -> 781.53s]  Top left.
[781.53s -> 781.93s]  Top left.
[781.93s -> 782.37s]  Top left.
[782.37s -> 782.69s]  All right.
[784.62s -> 785.14s]  Like up here.
[785.82s -> 786.70s]  Fastest way to get there.
[788.18s -> 788.94s]  Fastest way to get there.
[790.11s -> 790.95s]  Ignore the beast.
[790.95s -> 791.59s]  Go right to get it.
[791.59s -> 793.63s]  No, I want to, I want to, I got three hours.
[793.67s -> 795.59s]  I'm the timer hadn't even started yet.
[799.34s -> 799.86s]  Go West.
[799.86s -> 800.30s]  Go West.
[800.30s -> 800.74s]  Go West.
[801.18s -> 801.90s]  Central tower.
[803.06s -> 803.42s]  Right here.
[804.14s -> 804.38s]  Let's go.
[806.25s -> 806.49s]  All right.
[806.49s -> 809.17s]  Let the, uh, timer starts now.
[809.69s -> 810.13s]  Exactly.
[810.13s -> 810.37s]  Wait.
[810.45s -> 810.65s]  Yeah.
[810.65s -> 815.06s]  And exactly three hours from right now, I plan on seeing the ending credits of
[815.06s -> 820.60s]  breath of the wild and exactly three hours.
[820.60s -> 821.12s]  Exactly.
[828.86s -> 829.70s]  Try to use the horse.
[831.02s -> 833.78s]  I actually should get a horse because Frank too is somewhere.
[834.50s -> 835.46s]  I didn't cook any food.
[835.46s -> 835.66s]  All right.
[835.66s -> 836.42s]  That's where I need to end up.
[836.42s -> 836.66s]  Right.
[837.73s -> 839.05s]  So we need to go this way.
[840.67s -> 841.39s]  Stable right here.
[843.48s -> 844.36s]  Stable right there.
[844.36s -> 844.92s]  I want the horse.
[852.87s -> 853.75s]  He's got another raid.
[854.74s -> 856.50s]  It's like two huge raids back to back.
[863.22s -> 864.86s]  Activate the divine beast quest, dude.
[865.63s -> 867.23s]  I don't have the divine beast quest on.
[871.07s -> 871.23s]  All right.
[871.23s -> 876.11s]  That was P S P S P one G P S P big.
[877.99s -> 878.39s]  I don't read.
[878.39s -> 879.39s]  I can't read names ever.
[879.51s -> 880.39s]  I think that's that what it is.
[885.14s -> 886.26s]  It looks different over here.
[886.46s -> 887.54s]  It looks different over here.
[887.82s -> 888.62s]  It looks different over here.
[889.58s -> 890.50s]  I fucked up big time.
[890.54s -> 890.86s]  Didn't I?
[891.63s -> 892.71s]  I fucked up big time.
[893.15s -> 895.11s]  I, it, it says it looks like, okay.
[895.11s -> 897.23s]  PS one PSP one G.
[899.46s -> 900.38s]  I'm so sorry.
[900.38s -> 901.46s]  That's not how your name is said.
[901.66s -> 902.38s]  That's what it does.
[902.38s -> 903.50s]  It looks like over here on my other screen.
[903.50s -> 906.42s]  I'm really sorry, but you're fucking awesome for rating me.
[906.90s -> 907.30s]  Appreciate it.
[913.42s -> 914.22s]  Stop wasting time.
[914.26s -> 915.50s]  I'm not wasting time.
[915.54s -> 916.46s]  I'm apologizing.
[922.74s -> 924.34s]  What a PR disaster.
[926.37s -> 926.81s]  What I did.
[934.87s -> 936.79s]  Oh, I'm never going to do this in three hours.
[936.83s -> 938.11s]  I hope you bet accordingly.
[938.15s -> 938.99s]  God damn it.
[946.25s -> 947.29s]  Those are two huge rates though.
[947.29s -> 947.61s]  Thanks.
[947.65s -> 948.21s]  Welcome everybody.
[950.30s -> 951.22s]  All right, let's go.
[951.58s -> 952.86s]  We want Frank.
[953.38s -> 954.50s]  Where's Frank two.
[955.70s -> 960.64s]  On at this point, I don't know, but I need a horse and we're taking Frank.
[963.63s -> 964.47s]  Frank two died.
[967.81s -> 972.77s]  Unfortunate.
[973.09s -> 981.98s]  God damn it.
[982.38s -> 990.35s]  Frank two soft retired.
[992.58s -> 992.78s]  All right.
[992.78s -> 994.10s]  Let me turn the quest on.
[998.62s -> 998.82s]  Okay.
[998.82s -> 1005.46s]  Divine beast captured.
[1005.46s -> 1005.86s]  Remember, right?
[1005.86s -> 1006.86s]  Free the divine beasts.
[1009.72s -> 1010.80s]  It's all the way up here.
[1010.80s -> 1011.64s]  Why am I going this way?
[1011.64s -> 1012.64s]  Why would I not go over here?
[1014.31s -> 1015.11s]  Oh, I wanted the horse.
[1015.55s -> 1016.43s]  Wait, I can go this way.
[1017.03s -> 1017.59s]  Should I go up the road?
[1020.30s -> 1021.14s]  Just follow the road.
[1021.30s -> 1021.74s]  Trust.
[1021.78s -> 1022.10s]  Trust.
[1022.10s -> 1022.74s]  Just follow the road.
[1022.74s -> 1026.23s]  Go, go, go this way.
[1027.70s -> 1028.86s]  I need to cook food too.
[1030.06s -> 1030.94s]  Trust, trust, trust.
[1031.10s -> 1032.06s]  It's an ancient arrows.
[1033.02s -> 1036.56s]  Um, I'm just going, that's not the button to ride the horse.
[1044.62s -> 1047.70s]  I think that's the first time I've seen two just big raids back to back though.
[1048.30s -> 1049.78s]  Honestly, like all jokes aside.
[1049.78s -> 1050.18s]  Thanks guys.
[1051.42s -> 1052.30s]  Where would I start at the stream?
[1059.34s -> 1060.74s]  This is the easiest divine beast.
[1060.78s -> 1061.74s]  You definitely can do it.
[1062.86s -> 1063.18s]  All right.
[1063.18s -> 1065.38s]  Well, I also want to, I don't want to miss any shrines either.
[1065.74s -> 1066.74s]  That's my favorite part of the whole game.
[1070.82s -> 1073.14s]  There is no way you do this in three hours.
[1074.02s -> 1074.82s]  Oh, I hope you bet for it.
[1085.53s -> 1087.57s]  Shrines, no shot three hours.
[1087.69s -> 1088.33s]  I can do it.
[1089.83s -> 1091.63s]  Guys, it hasn't even been two minutes.
[1093.60s -> 1097.20s]  I've got a lot of those minutes lined up in a row.
[1100.59s -> 1101.59s]  And I have the horse this time.
[1101.63s -> 1103.95s]  The first time in the playthrough, I've actually used the horse more than five
[1103.95s -> 1104.11s]  minutes.
[1109.08s -> 1111.52s]  People right now are pissed that I actually went to the stable.
[1114.29s -> 1116.29s]  He's been running the entire game.
[1117.01s -> 1119.05s]  It's this time that he now uses the horse.
[1119.33s -> 1119.61s]  All right.
[1119.69s -> 1120.21s]  So where is it?
[1127.06s -> 1128.14s]  It's so far away.
[1134.24s -> 1134.76s]  Hell is that?
[1136.64s -> 1137.36s]  Look at the sky.
[1150.37s -> 1151.61s]  I crashed into a tree.
[1156.10s -> 1156.26s]  All right.
[1156.26s -> 1156.74s]  There's nothing here.
[1162.14s -> 1162.90s]  I'm looking for a tower.
[1162.90s -> 1174.05s]  Honestly, is there no tower like right here?
[1174.09s -> 1174.41s]  Hold on.
[1175.38s -> 1175.86s]  It has to be.
[1185.66s -> 1186.62s]  This is a huge mountain.
[1190.58s -> 1191.34s]  Follow the road.
[1196.69s -> 1198.09s]  That fox did a back flip.
[1199.23s -> 1200.07s]  Oh my God.
[1200.07s -> 1201.03s]  I didn't mean to.
[1207.94s -> 1208.58s]  Hold on a second.
[1208.58s -> 1210.58s]  You don't think I'm going to stop to get this stuff?
[1212.71s -> 1213.51s]  This stuff is still worth it.
[1215.26s -> 1216.66s]  I need to make food as well.
[1218.28s -> 1219.96s]  I'm going to stop at then whatever the next town is.
[1223.67s -> 1224.55s]  You laughed at him.
[1227.84s -> 1229.12s]  That was a crazy scenario.
[1229.28s -> 1229.80s]  I didn't mean to.
[1230.20s -> 1230.40s]  All right.
[1231.16s -> 1233.08s]  Uh, give me a tower.
[1239.73s -> 1252.97s]  Maybe I should just get a pie and just look through that.
[1256.46s -> 1257.54s]  I've not, I've seen this thing before.
[1263.16s -> 1264.64s]  Should I get a picture of this thing?
[1265.72s -> 1266.44s]  I'm going to take a picture of that.
[1274.21s -> 1275.49s]  Oh, I think I already did take a picture of this.
[1277.04s -> 1278.28s]  I can get a much better picture though.
[1281.10s -> 1281.66s]  Nice.
[1284.90s -> 1286.42s]  Wait, this one's better.
[1296.71s -> 1297.31s]  No, get it.
[1303.14s -> 1304.86s]  No, it has to be like touching his face.
[1306.67s -> 1307.15s]  Whatever.
[1307.55s -> 1308.43s]  Game sucks.
[1319.50s -> 1321.58s]  These are the easiest bits I ever made.
[1323.02s -> 1323.82s]  Wait, what do you mean?
[1324.78s -> 1328.14s]  Wait, did the, you can't bet bits and get bits back.
[1328.94s -> 1329.82s]  You mean channel point?
[1332.53s -> 1333.13s]  I can't move.
[1333.13s -> 1333.45s]  Hold on.
[1336.51s -> 1337.35s]  What's wrong with the horse?
[1341.50s -> 1342.42s]  Why is the horse not moving?
[1344.10s -> 1344.34s]  Okay.
[1344.54s -> 1346.98s]  I don't know what's going on, but I can't go that way.
[1354.02s -> 1354.26s]  All right.
[1354.26s -> 1355.42s]  You come to me then.
[1363.62s -> 1364.06s]  There we go.
[1368.75s -> 1369.55s]  How much time is left?
[1371.06s -> 1372.94s]  Hey, 10 minutes.
[1377.79s -> 1378.07s]  Okay.
[1378.15s -> 1381.71s]  I need help.
[1381.95s -> 1383.07s]  I need back seaters right now.
[1383.39s -> 1383.67s]  Help.
[1384.75s -> 1385.23s]  Where do I go?
[1386.27s -> 1387.31s]  I don't see a tower anywhere.
[1417.37s -> 1418.49s]  I don't do the point thing again.
[1432.02s -> 1432.66s]  I can't whatever.
[1434.66s -> 1440.16s]  I'm going that way.
[1452.20s -> 1455.16s]  Should have bet if you're going to beat this divine beast in three hours.
[1455.20s -> 1457.84s]  I've, I just saw the divine beast.
[1457.92s -> 1458.52s]  It's right there.
[1458.52s -> 1459.00s]  I found it.
[1459.76s -> 1460.72s]  And this is, I'm good.
[1461.28s -> 1461.64s]  Settle down.
[1466.30s -> 1466.58s]  You know what?
[1466.58s -> 1467.30s]  Why did I bring the horse?
[1467.30s -> 1468.86s]  I'm like, I, I like to glide.
[1471.09s -> 1472.21s]  What, what was the point of the horse?
[1472.57s -> 1473.37s]  I should have just glid.
[1474.67s -> 1475.15s]  Is that a word?
[1500.74s -> 1501.34s]  I glid.
[1505.66s -> 1506.14s]  That's correct.
[1506.14s -> 1506.34s]  Right?
[1519.85s -> 1520.37s]  Glowed.
[1521.66s -> 1522.42s]  Glided?
[1523.47s -> 1525.03s]  I glided over there.
[1525.71s -> 1526.71s]  I glid over there.
[1532.62s -> 1533.62s]  I glided over there.
[1533.66s -> 1534.38s]  I glid over there.
[1535.30s -> 1536.46s]  I glided over there.
[1540.98s -> 1541.54s]  How'd you get over there?
[1541.54s -> 1542.26s]  Well, I had to glide.
[1543.45s -> 1543.93s]  I glid.
[1550.63s -> 1551.55s]  Wait, am I going?
[1551.67s -> 1551.99s]  Okay.
[1552.03s -> 1552.71s]  I'm going the right way now.
[1559.43s -> 1561.71s]  I want to get a big picture of everything over here.
[1561.87s -> 1563.83s]  Cause there's not a tower like here anywhere.
[1569.16s -> 1569.76s]  Can I stand up here?
[1571.24s -> 1571.80s]  Yes, I can.
[1573.87s -> 1574.75s]  I'm going for the glide.
[1578.52s -> 1579.48s]  Forget about the horse.
[1580.22s -> 1586.86s]  I can cover three miles with the glider in a 10th of the time it takes to ride
[1586.86s -> 1591.89s]  with the horse and I get special mushroom.
[1603.90s -> 1604.30s]  Okay.
[1605.22s -> 1605.66s]  To get there.
[1605.66s -> 1606.30s]  I'm good.
[1607.76s -> 1609.60s]  I want a big picture of everything going on here.
[1615.70s -> 1616.78s]  Trine right there.
[1616.82s -> 1617.94s]  I'm going to ignore it for now.
[1621.11s -> 1622.35s]  What else is up here?
[1629.42s -> 1629.70s]  Okay.
[1629.70s -> 1630.58s]  Tower that way.
[1634.46s -> 1635.26s]  Tower over there.
[1637.13s -> 1639.29s]  I think that's the closest tower for sure.
[1641.67s -> 1643.27s]  You should get the shrine so you can travel.
[1643.31s -> 1646.79s]  Now that person is smart and I know I get it.
[1646.79s -> 1649.31s]  That's a good idea, but I know why you just told me to do that because you're
[1649.31s -> 1655.46s]  trying to burn like 40 minutes in that shrine and uh, I'm going to have to say
[1655.46s -> 1664.38s]  no, can I get the horse over here?
[1665.22s -> 1666.26s]  At least, uh, no.
[1667.60s -> 1667.80s]  All right.
[1667.80s -> 1672.64s]  So if I head that way, this is, that's definitely going the right direction.
[1672.68s -> 1673.04s]  It is.
[1673.56s -> 1673.88s]  All right.
[1674.08s -> 1674.76s]  Let's start the glider.
[1679.23s -> 1680.59s]  I'm covering miles right now.
[1688.92s -> 1690.64s]  To go over that, uh, the bridge.
[1690.68s -> 1699.49s]  No, I'm not, I, I'll get the shrine because it is fast travel, but let me
[1699.49s -> 1700.25s]  just take a look what's in there.
[1702.91s -> 1703.47s]  I'm not going to do it.
[1703.47s -> 1703.87s]  I just want to look.
[1719.58s -> 1720.02s]  Okay.
[1724.67s -> 1726.31s]  Let's get to the fast travel.
[1728.10s -> 1728.34s]  All right.
[1728.34s -> 1729.62s]  There's one right there too.
[1730.92s -> 1731.60s]  Which one is closer?
[1731.60s -> 1732.08s]  Probably that one.
[1732.12s -> 1733.40s]  That's also in the right direction.
[1733.40s -> 1733.92s]  So we're going that way.
[1737.69s -> 1739.05s]  You get sidetracked so easily.
[1740.28s -> 1742.32s]  I think that's, isn't that the whole point of Breath of the Wild though?
[1742.92s -> 1746.96s]  Isn't Breath of the Wild the game to get sidetracked in, out of all games?
[1749.86s -> 1750.02s]  All right.
[1750.02s -> 1750.58s]  It's activated.
[1750.58s -> 1751.78s]  I don't want to even see what's in there.
[1753.06s -> 1753.42s]  Is there one?
[1753.46s -> 1754.34s]  There's one over there too.
[1755.50s -> 1756.06s]  Let me mark that.
[1761.54s -> 1762.46s]  I don't know how to do that.
[1763.68s -> 1764.36s]  Uh, all right.
[1764.36s -> 1766.40s]  I'm going to mark it as a treasure chest.
[1766.40s -> 1767.56s]  Is that, is that even correct?
[1769.61s -> 1771.01s]  Bro, that's not even the right way.
[1771.41s -> 1773.65s]  I'm going to fuck myself over so bad if that's still here.
[1775.13s -> 1776.37s]  It's here.
[1777.82s -> 1779.74s]  I don't even know if I placed it.
[1780.10s -> 1780.34s]  All right.
[1780.34s -> 1783.86s]  I placed the other markers five months ago.
[1783.86s -> 1784.74s]  I don't even know what they're for.
[1785.70s -> 1787.06s]  They're probably really important though.
[1790.86s -> 1800.38s]  I placed that, I placed that red marker back in, I want to say April or March of
[1800.38s -> 1801.18s]  this year or something.
[1802.58s -> 1803.90s]  Take all my clothes off quick!
[1804.78s -> 1805.82s]  I'm going to get struck by lightning.
[1809.90s -> 1810.70s]  What do I do?
[1813.28s -> 1813.92s]  What do I do?
[1813.92s -> 1814.80s]  How do I take this off?
[1816.40s -> 1816.96s]  Unequip?
[1819.07s -> 1820.27s]  How do I just unequip something?
[1828.08s -> 1828.44s]  Okay.
[1829.66s -> 1829.94s]  See?
[1829.94s -> 1830.82s]  That was right there.
[1833.01s -> 1833.21s]  Okay.
[1833.21s -> 1834.05s]  I think I'm good.
[1834.45s -> 1837.29s]  I'm going to head that way and we're going to get to the tower.
[1841.24s -> 1842.24s]  Uh, wait, hold on.
[1842.24s -> 1842.68s]  There's something here.
[1843.64s -> 1845.27s]  Stables.
[1845.47s -> 1846.03s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[1847.46s -> 1848.14s]  The fuck?
[1848.18s -> 1849.10s]  Oh my God.
[1851.54s -> 1852.38s]  Can this hit them?
[1856.18s -> 1856.82s]  Wait, I can cook.
[1860.30s -> 1862.26s]  I'm not going to take very much time doing this.
[1864.19s -> 1866.63s]  I know this is people are like, Oh my God, dude, this is such shit food.
[1866.91s -> 1867.55s]  It doesn't matter.
[1867.55s -> 1868.27s]  I just need to eat it.
[1870.42s -> 1872.90s]  Salt and jalapenos, whatever this is.
[1883.36s -> 1884.00s]  Okay.
[1884.04s -> 1885.08s]  Do I have any meat or anything?
[1887.46s -> 1888.22s]  Mushroom.
[1889.22s -> 1889.62s]  What, okay.
[1889.62s -> 1891.74s]  What is the thing I have to be worried about up here?
[1892.45s -> 1893.29s]  Is it electricity?
[1893.29s -> 1894.13s]  Is it wind?
[1894.13s -> 1895.53s]  Is it fire?
[1895.57s -> 1896.17s]  What's the thing?
[1896.21s -> 1897.69s]  It's cold, cold areas.
[1897.73s -> 1898.17s]  It's cold.
[1898.21s -> 1898.45s]  Okay.
[1898.49s -> 1900.53s]  I need to get cold resistant stuff.
[1903.61s -> 1903.85s]  Okay.
[1903.93s -> 1905.01s]  So this is good for cold.
[1906.50s -> 1907.54s]  So let's go with this.
[1909.75s -> 1910.35s]  What about this one?
[1911.13s -> 1911.89s]  Stamina.
[1912.09s -> 1918.70s]  Uh, stealth.
[1918.74s -> 1920.06s]  Maybe just, uh, like a watermelon.
[1921.32s -> 1922.16s]  Heat resistance.
[1923.76s -> 1925.04s]  I don't think I have very much ingredients.
[1925.04s -> 1925.36s]  Do I?
[1931.76s -> 1932.48s]  I need more meat.
[1934.90s -> 1935.34s]  Banana.
[1938.18s -> 1938.70s]  Different effects.
[1938.70s -> 1939.54s]  Don't stack.
[1940.03s -> 1940.55s]  That's right.
[1940.71s -> 1942.19s]  Um, what does this do?
[1942.35s -> 1948.00s]  Uh, stop holding.
[1950.07s -> 1952.67s]  Should I just get, uh, you have an unsorted inventory.
[1953.15s -> 1953.47s]  Okay.
[1953.47s -> 1954.27s]  So it's sorted now.
[1957.26s -> 1959.50s]  So should I just do five of these?
[1959.70s -> 1960.78s]  Just one, two, three, four, five.
[1960.98s -> 1962.42s]  And just have like a bunch of low level.
[1962.58s -> 1965.69s]  Um, what do you guys think?
[1968.06s -> 1969.14s]  Just, that's what I got.
[1969.14s -> 1970.54s]  Just one, two, three, four, five with some salt.
[1973.35s -> 1975.67s]  Should I add salt or just one, two, three, four, five backseat.
[1976.21s -> 1980.82s]  Now, please put one wing in there.
[1981.26s -> 1982.34s]  No salt, just five.
[1985.40s -> 1985.76s]  See what it is.
[1990.71s -> 1991.79s]  Well, 10 minutes, 12 minutes.
[1993.28s -> 1993.64s]  Okay.
[1994.20s -> 1996.72s]  That's 12 minutes of low level cold resistance.
[1999.24s -> 2000.12s]  Is that going to be good enough?
[2000.48s -> 2001.28s]  What happens up here?
[2007.15s -> 2008.07s]  That's really all you need.
[2008.15s -> 2008.47s]  Okay.
[2013.21s -> 2014.53s]  Cause this will give us like 30 minutes.
[2018.34s -> 2019.14s]  I suppose too.
[2019.70s -> 2021.42s]  How much money do I have?
[2024.28s -> 2024.84s]  I'm going to, okay.
[2024.84s -> 2025.88s]  I think that's all right for now.
[2026.24s -> 2029.47s]  So let me get the horse.
[2031.06s -> 2032.02s]  How far away am I from though?
[2034.48s -> 2035.04s]  Thing there.
[2038.26s -> 2039.18s]  It's not that far.
[2039.18s -> 2039.38s]  All right.
[2039.42s -> 2040.98s]  I'm going to unlock that.
[2043.47s -> 2045.63s]  And then I'm going to get the horse.
[2045.67s -> 2046.87s]  I need to reveal the map.
[2047.47s -> 2048.43s]  Look, it's over there.
[2049.77s -> 2050.29s]  I'm getting close.
[2059.43s -> 2060.15s]  I need this.
[2061.76s -> 2062.64s]  Get the horse now.
[2064.29s -> 2065.13s]  I feel like I'm all right.
[2065.13s -> 2065.73s]  Here's what's going to happen.
[2065.73s -> 2066.37s]  I'm going to get the horse.
[2066.37s -> 2068.61s]  We're going to go across this bridge and I'm going to abandon the horse to
[2068.61s -> 2069.89s]  climb the side of the mountain up there.
[2070.98s -> 2071.70s]  It happens every time.
[2080.41s -> 2080.93s]  I'll try it though.
[2081.41s -> 2082.21s]  How much time do I have left?
[2082.97s -> 2083.65s]  Two and a half hours.
[2084.09s -> 2084.57s]  I got it.
[2084.77s -> 2085.09s]  Easy.
[2089.72s -> 2089.92s]  All right.
[2090.20s -> 2095.43s]  Let's get Frank to stay on the road.
[2096.82s -> 2097.50s]  I will stay on.
[2097.50s -> 2098.34s]  I'm not going to get off the horse.
[2099.02s -> 2102.69s]  Oh, okay.
[2105.90s -> 2106.06s]  All right.
[2106.06s -> 2106.30s]  Let's go.
[2106.30s -> 2110.46s]  Frank staying on the road.
[2111.02s -> 2111.74s]  No bullshit.
[2111.82s -> 2113.38s]  This is first time playing video.
[2115.27s -> 2116.79s]  No, I'll give you a little bit of insight though.
[2117.39s -> 2119.11s]  Um, so this is video game.
[2119.27s -> 2120.51s]  Let's just say video game one.
[2121.71s -> 2125.15s]  Um, since playing video game one, hold on a minute.
[2127.38s -> 2133.89s]  That was scary because I can possibly get struck by lightning on this bridge.
[2136.22s -> 2155.77s]  Yeah, I'm not going to go that way to stay on the bridge trying to stay on the
[2155.77s -> 2156.05s]  road.
[2156.05s -> 2158.01s]  They said stay on the road.
[2158.01s -> 2161.78s]  They said, look at all this shit on the road.
[2165.80s -> 2166.72s]  Where's he going to take that?
[2167.04s -> 2167.28s]  All right.
[2167.28s -> 2174.07s]  I'm getting close behind you.
[2175.11s -> 2183.57s]  I told you I was just going to climb the mountain after leaving the stable and
[2183.57s -> 2185.01s]  that's exactly what just happened.
[2214.19s -> 2214.87s]  You missed it.
[2216.74s -> 2217.98s]  What was there to miss?
[2220.50s -> 2221.10s]  You missed it.
[2223.46s -> 2224.42s]  He's leaving the road.
[2224.42s -> 2224.58s]  Yeah.
[2224.58s -> 2224.94s]  Look at this.
[2224.94s -> 2226.18s]  These things here, they're going to kill me.
[2228.02s -> 2229.10s]  You missed the dragon.
[2231.54s -> 2232.74s]  I don't know about any dragons.
[2233.02s -> 2236.18s]  I'm trying to get to the, I'm trying to get to the, the, the divine beast.
[2246.17s -> 2246.33s]  All right.
[2246.33s -> 2247.77s]  Well, so what I was saying is, so, okay.
[2248.88s -> 2253.28s]  Uh, so I, I played this game back in April of 2023.
[2253.28s -> 2259.05s]  I think it's been, it's been about five full months since I've not seen any of the
[2259.05s -> 2259.85s]  Zelda on the screen.
[2260.17s -> 2267.09s]  In the meantime, I played like 40 other video games, so it's like each video game
[2267.09s -> 2269.01s]  kind of is like, wait a minute.
[2269.05s -> 2271.73s]  Is that what it, oh no, that's from armored core.
[2271.85s -> 2272.93s]  That's the game I played a week ago.
[2273.41s -> 2274.33s]  Not four months ago.
[2275.66s -> 2276.58s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[2276.70s -> 2276.98s]  Okay.
[2277.02s -> 2277.98s]  This is what I can do.
[2277.98s -> 2278.42s]  I can do that.
[2278.50s -> 2278.98s]  No, no, no.
[2278.98s -> 2279.46s]  Wait, shit.
[2279.46s -> 2280.50s]  That's from hit man three.
[2281.18s -> 2281.62s]  Oh, I did it.
[2283.11s -> 2283.43s]  Wait, what?
[2286.88s -> 2291.45s]  Um, I, I need to shoot these.
[2291.93s -> 2292.53s]  Do I have any arrows?
[2295.88s -> 2296.56s]  What arrows do I have?
[2296.60s -> 2296.96s]  Hold on.
[2298.22s -> 2299.14s]  Do I have regular arrows?
[2304.98s -> 2305.10s]  Okay.
[2305.10s -> 2305.82s]  Well, I can do that.
[2306.18s -> 2306.66s]  Just come here.
[2308.79s -> 2310.47s]  I really don't want to use ice arrows.
[2326.54s -> 2332.16s]  Oh, I'm so impatient.
[2332.20s -> 2332.64s]  I hate it.
[2344.09s -> 2344.37s]  All right.
[2344.45s -> 2348.41s]  We got to see, I have, I can probably upgrade this, right?
[2357.58s -> 2357.94s]  Five.
[2359.15s -> 2359.31s]  All right.
[2359.31s -> 2360.67s]  Well, that's the destination.
[2360.67s -> 2361.23s]  I'm going that way.
[2362.47s -> 2363.15s]  Forget about these guys.
[2374.46s -> 2376.22s]  You won't beat this divine beast in three hours.
[2376.82s -> 2377.34s]  I bet you I do.
[2380.87s -> 2381.71s]  I want to unlock this.
[2387.37s -> 2387.77s]  You need to buy.
[2387.77s -> 2389.21s]  Yeah, I definitely gonna get arrows for sure.
[2395.69s -> 2399.82s]  Uh, oh yeah.
[2399.82s -> 2400.46s]  That's really funny.
[2402.26s -> 2405.86s]  You know, the, the, the Jeremy from eight months ago when I last played this would
[2405.86s -> 2407.06s]  have got hit by that a hundred percent.
[2422.58s -> 2424.26s]  Let me put on a different weapon.
[2428.92s -> 2429.16s]  Hold on.
[2429.16s -> 2431.00s]  Let me relearn the entire video game.
[2431.28s -> 2431.56s]  Got it.
[2445.44s -> 2446.32s]  Your name is Jeremy?
[2447.49s -> 2449.89s]  Uh, yeah.
[2452.22s -> 2454.22s]  Don't these things have eyes that you get to kill?
[2463.74s -> 2464.46s]  I wonder if it matters.
[2464.98s -> 2465.62s]  Maybe I can just climb it.
[2473.33s -> 2473.61s]  All right.
[2473.69s -> 2476.97s]  Whoever's editing this video, I want you to make it look like I hit that thing right
[2476.97s -> 2479.77s]  in the head and then have it like cut it out and to do an animation.
[2479.77s -> 2481.09s]  So it looks like I killed it in one hit.
[2485.82s -> 2486.42s]  That's why I did that.
[2493.58s -> 2497.04s]  Can I just get like, get on top of this right now?
[2497.08s -> 2497.48s]  Hold on.
[2498.52s -> 2500.91s]  Uh, I can't touch that stuff.
[2500.95s -> 2501.55s]  Where's the eye?
[2501.63s -> 2502.43s]  Is it going to eye on this?
[2507.02s -> 2507.98s]  That comes across here.
[2509.85s -> 2510.65s]  I feel like this is going to hurt.
[2511.01s -> 2513.77s]  Is there a better place for me to, let me kill the eye.
[2513.81s -> 2515.01s]  I know it exists somewhere over here.
[2523.57s -> 2524.85s]  Cause you can get rid of this purple stuff.
[2529.11s -> 2530.11s]  That's lying to you.
[2530.19s -> 2531.07s]  No, there's no eye.
[2532.62s -> 2533.14s]  Oh, it's okay.
[2535.36s -> 2535.76s]  Fine.
[2538.30s -> 2540.18s]  Is there a better place to grab it from?
[2540.18s -> 2540.50s]  I wonder.
[2540.50s -> 2540.78s]  Hold on.
[2540.78s -> 2541.22s]  Let me go up here.
[2545.97s -> 2548.01s]  The backseat dream stream.
[2548.41s -> 2560.47s]  This is windy.
[2566.50s -> 2566.94s]  Grab.
[2569.50s -> 2581.80s]  Oh, um, is there a place I can shit?
[2586.16s -> 2587.32s]  Is there no spot I can go up?
[2592.34s -> 2593.26s]  I don't think there is up here.
[2593.26s -> 2593.46s]  All right.
[2593.46s -> 2594.82s]  So I have to, I have to kill something then.
[2597.33s -> 2597.85s]  No jump.
[2598.25s -> 2599.21s]  Why are you?
[2599.25s -> 2601.61s]  No, I want to just jump backwards.
[2602.41s -> 2604.89s]  I want to just jump backwards, but of course not.
[2605.93s -> 2607.17s]  Oh my God.
[2609.11s -> 2614.47s]  I wanted to just jump backwards, but I'm not facing the exact perfect angle to go
[2614.47s -> 2614.83s]  back.
[2618.77s -> 2619.85s]  I have to save the game too.
[2619.85s -> 2630.22s]  Somebody just said, all right, where's the eye?
[2630.26s -> 2637.97s]  Tell me you should heal.
[2641.05s -> 2641.69s]  I'll eat a banana.
[2641.69s -> 2642.17s]  That sounds good.
[2646.58s -> 2647.30s]  Oh, everyone's lying.
[2647.30s -> 2647.82s]  There is no eye.
[2647.82s -> 2648.06s]  Okay.
[2648.06s -> 2648.30s]  All right.
[2648.30s -> 2649.26s]  So don't, don't trust chat.
[2649.30s -> 2649.58s]  I get it.
[2650.26s -> 2650.94s]  There's no eye.
[2651.95s -> 2652.79s]  How do I get up there then?
[2660.77s -> 2661.53s]  I'm the stump.
[2662.26s -> 2665.86s]  Um, I need to buy food if I can or harvest some food.
[2668.37s -> 2673.58s]  This just is what just gives you hearts and whatever.
[2673.86s -> 2678.48s]  Is there a place I can go from?
[2689.89s -> 2691.29s]  I bet if I get up here, I can do it.
[2695.30s -> 2696.22s]  You'd find a safe spot.
[2712.33s -> 2715.57s]  If there is an eye, it's going to be in some weird random place, isn't it?
[2716.09s -> 2719.37s]  But maybe I just can't get up there unless I do something in particular.
[2722.50s -> 2723.62s]  There's an eye behind you.
[2726.35s -> 2727.03s]  Not it right there.
[2727.03s -> 2727.35s]  Is it?
[2729.02s -> 2729.98s]  Did I just see it right there?
[2731.46s -> 2731.94s]  It's right there.
[2731.94s -> 2732.30s]  It's right there.
[2732.30s -> 2732.62s]  It's right there.
[2732.62s -> 2733.06s]  It's right there.
[2734.33s -> 2735.81s]  Look at, look at how hidden this is.
[2737.77s -> 2737.97s]  What?
[2742.27s -> 2743.27s]  Did you see how hidden that was?
[2754.79s -> 2755.11s]  Good to go.
[2755.39s -> 2767.66s]  Oh, please don't fall.
[2776.40s -> 2777.68s]  I wanted to jump backwards.
[2777.96s -> 2778.84s]  How do you just jump?
[2791.46s -> 2793.46s]  I pressed just B and he just fell down.
[2794.26s -> 2795.02s]  He didn't jump backwards.
[2795.02s -> 2795.98s]  By the way, I win.
[2796.30s -> 2812.51s]  I fall down here.
[2816.21s -> 2817.81s]  Can I ask you a backseat question?
[2817.81s -> 2819.05s]  How do you just drop?
[2820.18s -> 2821.90s]  Cause when I press B, he jumps up.
[2822.02s -> 2823.34s]  How do I just let go?
[2823.95s -> 2824.67s]  It's X, right?
[2826.05s -> 2826.49s]  Of course it is.
[2827.81s -> 2829.41s]  How do I, how do I jump backwards?
[2834.36s -> 2835.36s]  Is it down in B?
[2835.68s -> 2836.00s]  It is.
[2836.24s -> 2836.48s]  Okay.
[2837.62s -> 2839.98s]  But you have to be doing it the right, so it's not down in B.
[2839.98s -> 2843.06s]  It's like, if I was facing like over there, it'd be left in B.
[2851.28s -> 2851.72s]  Can I make it?
[2862.30s -> 2862.58s]  All right.
[2862.66s -> 2862.94s]  I got it.
[2877.75s -> 2878.99s]  That took 25 minutes.
[2885.71s -> 2886.91s]  He's not going to beat Ganon.
[2887.39s -> 2887.91s]  Watch me.
[2893.68s -> 2896.08s]  I can't wait till the credits roll and all the people that bet against
[2896.08s -> 2897.28s]  me are just seething.
[2914.09s -> 2914.73s]  There we go.
[2916.86s -> 2917.66s]  So we're going.
[2919.45s -> 2920.09s]  Oh, look at that.
[2920.81s -> 2922.77s]  Now I know exactly where the hell I can go.
[2923.37s -> 2924.41s]  This thing's on an Island.
[2924.41s -> 2925.05s]  I didn't know that.
[2927.45s -> 2928.99s]  All right, here we go.
[2929.84s -> 2930.56s]  What else is over here?
[2934.92s -> 2936.40s]  I think we're just gliding over there.
[2939.11s -> 2940.79s]  I'm gliding to that shrine over there.
[2955.49s -> 2955.77s]  Look at that.
[2955.81s -> 2956.13s]  Perfect.
[2971.68s -> 2975.00s]  Remember, if you get to the last hour, please just go right to Ganon.
[2975.44s -> 2984.75s]  Even if I'm in the middle of doing this, go immediately to Ganon when
[2984.75s -> 2985.27s]  they're, all right.
[2985.31s -> 2991.90s]  So what at 335, I have to go right to Ganon no matter what.
[2991.94s -> 2993.14s]  That's actually really funny.
[2995.58s -> 2996.34s]  All right, well, here we are.
[2999.47s -> 3002.55s]  There's a shrine here and the thing I need to do is right here.
[3002.59s -> 3003.11s]  It's right here.
[3005.69s -> 3006.77s]  What's the best way to get in here?
[3006.77s -> 3007.77s]  This way around here.
[3010.14s -> 3010.50s]  Maybe this.
[3010.58s -> 3010.86s]  Okay.
[3010.86s -> 3011.70s]  Top left, maybe.
[3019.44s -> 3019.60s]  All right.
[3019.60s -> 3020.20s]  There's a bridge over here.
[3031.84s -> 3032.52s]  Wait, does this do anything?
[3033.99s -> 3035.07s]  It's not like a thing I can activate, right?
[3040.43s -> 3040.91s]  Get away from me.
[3043.78s -> 3043.94s]  All right.
[3043.94s -> 3045.46s]  There's the bridge up into there.
[3045.46s -> 3047.30s]  And then I start that divine beast.
[3049.18s -> 3052.14s]  I'll have a solid, probably hour and 25 minutes, hour and 30 minutes to beat it.
[3054.50s -> 3055.26s]  I do need to buy stuff.
[3055.66s -> 3058.78s]  I need to buy arrows and I need to buy, um, I need to get some heals.
[3070.85s -> 3071.09s]  All right.
[3071.65s -> 3073.93s]  I think I made decent time going that way.
[3077.71s -> 3079.19s]  Fight Ganon blindfolded.
[3079.67s -> 3081.23s]  Well, we're not, we're not doing that today.
[3095.75s -> 3097.39s]  Have you done Hyrule castle at all?
[3098.19s -> 3099.11s]  I don't think so.
[3100.41s -> 3101.13s]  Hey, staples.
[3104.83s -> 3105.15s]  All right.
[3105.15s -> 3111.21s]  I am going, I actually, I'm going to take a minute to kind of, I need to get the horse.
[3111.33s -> 3111.89s]  I'll do that.
[3112.29s -> 3114.89s]  We'll actually keep the horse this time and not just throw away.
[3123.22s -> 3125.30s]  I do want to get at least somewhat prepared.
[3137.58s -> 3139.98s]  So can I buy stuff from you?
[3140.02s -> 3141.14s]  Just like a general store, right?
[3142.07s -> 3142.79s]  I wonder, can I?
[3146.99s -> 3148.47s]  No, you have to pay for this.
[3148.47s -> 3149.47s]  No, no, no, no.
[3149.47s -> 3150.19s]  Is there a store here?
[3150.71s -> 3159.66s]  This is just the stables and in a beetle was beetle is beetle random.
[3160.06s -> 3160.50s]  I think beetle.
[3160.74s -> 3161.14s]  Oh no, no, no.
[3161.14s -> 3161.50s]  You're right here.
[3161.50s -> 3161.70s]  Okay.
[3167.61s -> 3167.73s]  All right.
[3167.73s -> 3168.01s]  What do you got?
[3171.60s -> 3172.88s]  Uh, all right.
[3173.89s -> 3175.13s]  Incredibly important.
[3175.33s -> 3176.65s]  I need a ton of these, right?
[3178.06s -> 3188.02s]  I should get as many arrows as I can physically carry by every arrow.
[3192.67s -> 3192.87s]  All right.
[3193.15s -> 3194.79s]  I'm going to buy every single arrow.
[3194.83s -> 3195.79s]  These are expensive.
[3204.80s -> 3205.04s]  Okay.
[3205.52s -> 3206.12s]  What about this stuff?
[3208.22s -> 3208.54s]  Reset.
[3208.54s -> 3208.78s]  Okay.
[3208.94s -> 3209.54s]  Cold resist.
[3209.54s -> 3210.30s]  I'm going to get all these.
[3211.97s -> 3212.17s]  Okay.
[3212.17s -> 3213.77s]  With monster parts for an elixir.
[3214.75s -> 3215.23s]  Give me them all.
[3219.38s -> 3219.70s]  Okay.
[3220.70s -> 3229.13s]  Uh, temporarily maxed stamina, quiet movement.
[3230.19s -> 3232.11s]  I don't think, I don't think I need that.
[3233.22s -> 3239.95s]  Now let me go make some cold resist up over here.
[3244.33s -> 3244.53s]  All right.
[3244.61s -> 3246.17s]  The monster parts.
[3249.60s -> 3249.96s]  All right.
[3250.08s -> 3255.39s]  Uh, ingredient, any of these wings, higher quality, or just just by just
[3255.39s -> 3262.29s]  different properties, explode electricity.
[3263.25s -> 3264.33s]  I have a few of these frogs already.
[3268.10s -> 3268.62s]  Okay.
[3268.70s -> 3271.21s]  So I want to make an elixir.
[3272.19s -> 3273.19s]  That's monster parts.
[3273.23s -> 3275.64s]  The thing I just got up with some carrots.
[3282.22s -> 3282.42s]  Okay.
[3282.46s -> 3283.18s]  Where are those?
[3283.70s -> 3283.98s]  What are they?
[3284.18s -> 3285.78s]  Butterflies or something or moths?
[3285.78s -> 3286.10s]  What are they?
[3286.10s -> 3286.46s]  Where are they?
[3286.78s -> 3293.37s]  There's a thing I just bought.
[3294.34s -> 3295.02s]  Oh, here they get down here.
[3298.34s -> 3298.54s]  All right.
[3298.54s -> 3299.50s]  So how many of these should I hold?
[3299.50s -> 3300.14s]  Just one?
[3301.46s -> 3302.94s]  Or should I put five of these in here?
[3306.10s -> 3309.82s]  Should I just make one with a bunch of random stuff or do four with all five?
[3310.18s -> 3310.74s]  Do them all.
[3311.75s -> 3313.71s]  Four with a, with a monster part or with guts.
[3314.87s -> 3315.11s]  Hell yeah.
[3315.11s -> 3315.51s]  Let's go.
[3316.69s -> 3318.81s]  Uh, any type of guts I should use?
[3322.98s -> 3324.86s]  I mean, this is, this thing's pretty, pretty good.
[3328.34s -> 3329.54s]  Would everybody be all right with this?
[3333.91s -> 3335.31s]  It needs to be guts, not tail.
[3339.99s -> 3340.51s]  How about this?
[3345.32s -> 3345.92s]  This looks pretty good.
[3359.26s -> 3359.54s]  All right.
[3359.54s -> 3362.50s]  That's high level cold resist.
[3364.17s -> 3364.69s]  The other thing.
[3366.49s -> 3367.21s]  What do you mean we got them?
[3367.81s -> 3368.78s]  Oh my God.
[3368.90s -> 3369.58s]  Wait, was that bad?
[3370.71s -> 3372.27s]  Now just go, go, go, go, go.
[3372.27s -> 3372.51s]  All right.
[3372.51s -> 3372.75s]  All right.
[3372.75s -> 3372.95s]  All right.
[3372.95s -> 3373.19s]  Right.
[3373.90s -> 3374.18s]  Okay.
[3374.18s -> 3374.82s]  Now go.
[3376.96s -> 3377.44s]  All right.
[3377.44s -> 3378.48s]  I'm going, I'm going.
[3385.18s -> 3385.38s]  All right.
[3385.62s -> 3386.50s]  That's going to make it to the bridge.
[3387.14s -> 3387.90s]  I can't turn.
[3387.90s -> 3388.74s]  I can't turn.
[3388.74s -> 3389.82s]  I can't turn.
[3390.34s -> 3392.30s]  How do you control the horse in this game?
[3393.06s -> 3394.14s]  I can't turn.
[3400.43s -> 3402.70s]  Go on the bridge.
[3420.90s -> 3422.30s]  Oh my God.
[3422.62s -> 3423.42s]  Why?
[3429.82s -> 3432.18s]  That was so outrageous.
[3437.52s -> 3438.72s]  It's a horse on a bridge.
[3438.76s -> 3439.52s]  Leave him alone.
[3439.56s -> 3441.08s]  I, yeah, that is like kind of scary.
[3444.86s -> 3446.54s]  He's outraged right now.
[3448.42s -> 3449.18s]  All right, here we go.
[3449.18s -> 3450.30s]  It's time to start the mission.
[3454.06s -> 3454.22s]  All right.
[3454.22s -> 3454.66s]  You know what?
[3454.66s -> 3455.30s]  I'm getting off.
[3455.74s -> 3456.74s]  I'm getting off the horse.
[3457.82s -> 3460.54s]  Not only does the horse not like bridges, the horse just
[3460.54s -> 3462.98s]  wants to go on a straight line off the cliff.
[3463.46s -> 3464.90s]  I'm not about that right now.
[3478.60s -> 3480.00s]  Oh, he is not about that.
[3482.72s -> 3483.08s]  Cool.
[3484.26s -> 3484.66s]  All right.
[3492.74s -> 3493.74s]  So what's the strategy here?
[3493.74s -> 3494.34s]  How do we get up there?
[3498.30s -> 3499.22s]  I don't understand what's going on, dude.
[3499.22s -> 3500.58s]  Didn't you kill that guy in one shot?
[3501.94s -> 3502.62s]  Oh, earlier.
[3502.62s -> 3502.94s]  Yeah.
[3503.30s -> 3504.54s]  I got through phase one really quickly.
[3504.54s -> 3505.30s]  It's a speed run strat.
[3506.30s -> 3509.54s]  Uh, phase two is when the, the actual like ceiling fans start turning on.
[3511.18s -> 3512.70s]  Uh, which allows them to go a little bit higher.
[3512.82s -> 3514.14s]  So it's phase two.
[3515.26s -> 3516.82s]  Really a keen eye you have there though.
[3516.94s -> 3517.50s]  Really keen eye.
[3521.00s -> 3521.24s]  Okay.
[3521.24s -> 3521.96s]  Here we are.
[3522.00s -> 3522.88s]  Rito village.
[3524.93s -> 3526.69s]  I know there's not time to talk, but there is.
[3528.58s -> 3529.66s]  Now's not a good time.
[3530.02s -> 3530.38s]  Where am I?
[3531.22s -> 3534.46s]  This is Rito village, but well, you could say we're not in a welcoming mood.
[3535.55s -> 3535.75s]  Okay.
[3540.79s -> 3542.63s]  So we have to go.
[3542.67s -> 3543.87s]  I'm imagining probably up here at the top.
[3545.91s -> 3547.71s]  Blow the dust out of your switch, bro.
[3557.94s -> 3560.46s]  I think, I think that's just how this game runs.
[3562.82s -> 3563.14s]  All right.
[3563.14s -> 3564.42s]  This is really important.
[3564.78s -> 3566.14s]  Is it anything that I need from here?
[3569.23s -> 3569.91s]  More arrows.
[3569.91s -> 3570.35s]  I'll take them.
[3575.46s -> 3578.14s]  Three arrows for 60 bucks.
[3580.55s -> 3581.07s]  Oh, it's a bundle.
[3581.07s -> 3581.27s]  Okay.
[3588.72s -> 3589.36s]  Oh, it's expensive.
[3591.81s -> 3593.85s]  I'm imagining this probably gear I should get too.
[3596.93s -> 3597.73s]  I want to check that out first.
[3603.29s -> 3604.01s]  All right.
[3605.31s -> 3607.07s]  Snow quill trousers.
[3608.19s -> 3608.91s]  Cold resist.
[3609.71s -> 3613.03s]  Five, three, cold resist.
[3613.07s -> 3613.27s]  Okay.
[3613.27s -> 3614.99s]  So which one has the most cold resist?
[3614.99s -> 3615.39s]  Does it matter?
[3615.39s -> 3615.99s]  Are they all the same?
[3618.39s -> 3618.99s]  He's broke.
[3619.07s -> 3620.03s]  I have enough of the Chesapease.
[3621.84s -> 3622.64s]  What do I got on right now?
[3624.65s -> 3625.57s]  Have the, okay.
[3625.57s -> 3626.65s]  This is the swimming ones.
[3627.29s -> 3628.89s]  I want to keep the bandana on.
[3634.88s -> 3635.36s]  Okay.
[3635.40s -> 3636.56s]  This one's good.
[3639.68s -> 3640.76s]  Uh, I'm going to buy it.
[3645.88s -> 3646.92s]  I should, I need to upgrade this.
[3646.92s -> 3648.36s]  This thing is terrible.
[3649.32s -> 3649.92s]  Oh no, it's not.
[3649.92s -> 3650.32s]  13.
[3650.32s -> 3650.76s]  That's good.
[3651.36s -> 3651.48s]  Yeah.
[3651.48s -> 3651.84s]  Put it on.
[3651.84s -> 3652.20s]  That's fine.
[3654.81s -> 3655.49s]  Do some selling.
[3658.11s -> 3658.91s]  I could sell some stuff.
[3660.25s -> 3661.25s]  What should I sell?
[3667.28s -> 3668.56s]  Dude, I'm selling this.
[3668.72s -> 3669.84s]  Oh, it's only 15.
[3669.84s -> 3670.32s]  Nevermind.
[3674.30s -> 3678.30s]  Selling my exclusive Nintendo switch shirt for 15 coins.
[3679.62s -> 3681.54s]  I have a lot of Tophaz.
[3685.54s -> 3686.78s]  I'm just gonna sell like 10 of these.
[3688.10s -> 3688.46s]  Five?
[3689.22s -> 3690.38s]  Sell all the gems.
[3690.38s -> 3691.10s]  Sell all of them.
[3691.10s -> 3692.70s]  You look at all these gems you got.
[3693.62s -> 3694.34s]  I'm going to keep one of each.
[3696.98s -> 3698.06s]  1600 bucks.
[3706.22s -> 3706.86s]  Holy shit.
[3707.42s -> 3708.10s]  I'm rich right now.
[3708.74s -> 3710.34s]  You're never going to use these for any reason.
[3711.93s -> 3712.21s]  Okay.
[3712.25s -> 3712.53s]  True.
[3713.89s -> 3716.13s]  You guys got to, you have to absolutely gas me up for this.
[3716.13s -> 3718.09s]  I need every, I need every move.
[3718.73s -> 3720.49s]  I need all the incredibly expensive shit.
[3721.25s -> 3722.41s]  I want all the best gear in the whole game.
[3722.41s -> 3723.97s]  Like I got five grand now.
[3723.97s -> 3724.41s]  Where do I get it?
[3733.22s -> 3733.54s]  Okay.
[3736.55s -> 3737.59s]  Uh, I'm, I'm good.
[3737.59s -> 3737.87s]  I'm good.
[3737.87s -> 3738.19s]  I'm good.
[3739.83s -> 3740.19s]  I'm good.
[3740.63s -> 3741.43s]  I'm not selling everything.
[3741.43s -> 3741.63s]  No.
[3741.91s -> 3742.43s]  There's no reason to.
[3746.97s -> 3747.17s]  Okay.
[3747.33s -> 3748.41s]  I'm getting these and I'm going to get pants.
[3753.25s -> 3754.65s]  I could go to the, that area.
[3757.92s -> 3758.52s]  All right.
[3758.56s -> 3765.00s]  So, horsepower fire to make cold climates more tolerable.
[3768.10s -> 3768.30s]  All right.
[3768.34s -> 3770.38s]  So I am now completely resistant to cold.
[3772.88s -> 3775.72s]  Is there anything else I should buy that I should really get?
[3784.03s -> 3784.83s]  Get the bomb arrows.
[3785.43s -> 3786.43s]  I was going to say that too.
[3787.35s -> 3789.19s]  I was thinking it, I just didn't say it out loud.
[3794.13s -> 3795.29s]  You're a potato streamer.
[3796.41s -> 3796.73s]  That's all right.
[3796.89s -> 3797.25s]  I don't care.
[3799.74s -> 3803.46s]  Potatoes are fucking incredibly easy to like make and eat and stuff.
[3806.88s -> 3808.00s]  They're, they're, they're good.
[3808.04s -> 3808.48s]  They're healthy.
[3808.48s -> 3809.00s]  They're filling.
[3809.80s -> 3810.20s]  Who cares?
[3811.04s -> 3811.16s]  Yeah.
[3811.44s -> 3812.52s]  Why are you saying that like the bad thing?
[3813.12s -> 3813.84s]  The butter too.
[3813.96s -> 3814.12s]  Yeah.
[3814.12s -> 3814.36s]  Fine.
[3823.42s -> 3823.90s]  I'll take one.
[3837.97s -> 3839.57s]  Actually, I'm just getting this cause it's food.
[3849.29s -> 3856.05s]  Oh, you can't eat wheat.
[3856.29s -> 3857.45s]  I can combine it with stuff.
[3866.92s -> 3868.44s]  So he said, keep it moving.
[3869.20s -> 3870.48s]  Keep it moving.
[3871.00s -> 3871.48s]  Okay.
[3877.13s -> 3883.61s]  Oh, did you say I've never seen somebody spend $3,000 on food ever in this game?
[3886.57s -> 3887.85s]  Yeah, but they weren't up against the clock.
[3898.54s -> 3899.50s]  Oh, hold on a second.
[3899.50s -> 3899.94s]  Look at this.
[3901.18s -> 3904.78s]  I need to unlock the shrine.
[3908.09s -> 3909.73s]  Is there anything over here that I can teleport to?
[3909.73s -> 3910.57s]  That's not the shrine.
[3913.18s -> 3915.18s]  That's a good, let me actually get the quest first.
[3915.82s -> 3916.18s]  Here we go.
[3916.26s -> 3916.86s]  All right, let's go.
[3916.86s -> 3917.22s]  Let's do it.
[3919.81s -> 3920.13s]  Welcome.
[3920.21s -> 3921.81s]  Oh, an object on your hip.
[3921.85s -> 3922.53s]  Could it be?
[3923.29s -> 3923.69s]  Forgive me.
[3923.69s -> 3924.05s]  Where am I?
[3924.05s -> 3924.29s]  Man?
[3924.93s -> 3927.85s]  I am Kenobi elder of Rito village.
[3930.08s -> 3930.48s]  How then?
[3931.04s -> 3933.64s]  Is that not a sheikah slate dangling from your hip?
[3936.21s -> 3936.97s]  Oh my.
[3936.97s -> 3937.93s]  So it is true.
[3939.70s -> 3942.54s]  It means you must be a champion like master Revali.
[3943.10s -> 3946.22s]  One of the few able to board divine beast of Midor.
[3949.30s -> 3949.98s]  What am I thinking?
[3949.98s -> 3952.62s]  The champions have all been dead for a hundred years.
[3954.26s -> 3958.30s]  Boy must have, must be a mere descendant and inheritor of the sheikah slate.
[3959.62s -> 3960.30s]  Ah, forgive me.
[3960.78s -> 3961.18s]  Let me listen.
[3961.42s -> 3963.54s]  If you would listen to this old man's request, would you have to give my
[3963.54s -> 3964.02s]  eternal gratitude?
[3964.46s -> 3964.66s]  Sure.
[3964.66s -> 3964.94s]  Listen.
[3966.14s -> 3968.42s]  Now that I know that you have a champion, there's something I must ask you.
[3969.30s -> 3969.78s]  How should I put this?
[3970.54s -> 3973.34s]  I would like you to deal with the giant beast cycling above us.
[3974.02s -> 3975.66s]  Only a chosen one champion can stop a champion beast.
[3975.70s -> 3976.90s]  You must enter the beast and bring him to me.
[3978.07s -> 3979.75s]  I explained this to you, more headstrong Rito warriors, but
[3979.75s -> 3980.59s]  they wouldn't listen to what I did.
[3982.21s -> 3985.93s]  Tiba and Hearth tried to confront Midor, but it did not go well.
[3985.93s -> 3987.05s]  And Hearth was injured.
[3988.42s -> 3991.62s]  Tiba escaped unscathed, but I fear he now plans to face Midor alone.
[3993.22s -> 3993.58s]  That's it.
[3995.50s -> 3995.86s]  You get it.
[3996.26s -> 3996.50s]  All right.
[3996.54s -> 3997.58s]  Find Tiba.
[3997.98s -> 4001.66s]  If you work together, you may be able to stop divine beast Va-Midor.
[4005.55s -> 4006.19s]  Okay.
[4014.45s -> 4016.93s]  Forgive my intrusion, but I overheard you speaking with the elder.
[4018.17s -> 4021.77s]  Sounds like you intend to help my husband Tiba in the fight against Midor.
[4023.44s -> 4026.24s]  But to tell you the truth, there's not much I can do for you right now.
[4026.28s -> 4027.88s]  Beyond telling you where my husband went.
[4028.20s -> 4028.40s]  All right.
[4028.40s -> 4028.72s]  Where'd he go?
[4031.50s -> 4035.06s]  Well, my husband headed to a place called the flight range.
[4035.86s -> 4039.66s]  It's in Drawnox pass at the base of the Hebra mountains.
[4040.46s -> 4042.70s]  It's a place where Rito warriors prepare for aerial combat.
[4043.46s -> 4045.74s]  It's gone there to gather weapons for another run at Midor.
[4046.83s -> 4049.99s]  As it happens, he made his way to the flight range on foot this time.
[4054.75s -> 4056.95s]  You take off from Revali's landing.
[4057.35s -> 4059.15s]  It's a straight shot down to the flight range.
[4060.95s -> 4063.55s]  Revali's landing is a memorial for the Rito champion, Revali.
[4064.19s -> 4066.65s]  Okay.
[4067.45s -> 4067.69s]  All right.
[4067.93s -> 4068.33s]  I'm ready.
[4072.42s -> 4073.74s]  How much pizza do I eat a year?
[4075.10s -> 4076.02s]  Um, let's do the math.
[4077.67s -> 4081.30s]  We got, let's say like one to two pizzas a month.
[4082.10s -> 4083.94s]  Maybe like one pizza a month, baby.
[4086.46s -> 4088.58s]  12, maybe 12 to 15 pizzas a year.
[4093.37s -> 4093.65s]  Depends.
[4098.38s -> 4099.22s]  Those are rookie numbers.
[4102.71s -> 4103.43s]  Sometimes it's more.
[4103.51s -> 4103.83s]  Depends.
[4111.28s -> 4111.96s]  Impressive.
[4111.96s -> 4112.48s]  I know.
[4112.88s -> 4115.52s]  Very few can achieve a mastery of the sky.
[4115.84s -> 4116.20s]  Okay, cool.
[4116.36s -> 4119.96s]  Yet I have made an art of creating an updraft that allows me to
[4119.96s -> 4120.28s]  solve.
[4120.28s -> 4121.76s]  Oh, this is where I'm going to learn how to get it.
[4121.76s -> 4125.16s]  Considered to be quite the masterpiece of aerial techniques, even among the Rito.
[4126.04s -> 4130.60s]  With proper utilization of my superior skills, I see no reason why we couldn't
[4130.64s -> 4131.08s]  easily.
[4131.12s -> 4133.60s]  Didn't I get really mad at flying last time?
[4133.72s -> 4139.63s]  My ability to explore the firmament is certainly of note, but let's not pardon
[4139.63s -> 4140.63s]  me for being so blunt.
[4140.67s -> 4143.39s]  Let's not forget the fact that I am the most skilled archer of all
[4143.39s -> 4143.99s]  the Rito.
[4145.64s -> 4150.84s]  Yet despite these truths, it seems that I've been tapped to merely assist you all
[4150.84s -> 4154.80s]  because you happen to have that little darkness ceiling sword on your back.
[4154.96s -> 4155.72s]  The master sword, right?
[4155.92s -> 4157.64s]  I mean, I'm glad I picked that up.
[4157.64s -> 4159.12s]  Just asinine.
[4160.84s -> 4163.60s]  Unless you think you can prove me wrong.
[4164.32s -> 4166.68s]  Maybe we should just settle this one on one.
[4167.48s -> 4168.56s]  All right, but where?
[4168.96s -> 4170.20s]  Oh, I know.
[4170.52s -> 4171.84s]  How about up there?
[4176.54s -> 4178.82s]  Oh, you must pardon me.
[4179.18s -> 4183.34s]  I forgot you have no way of making it up to that divine beast on your own.
[4186.14s -> 4188.94s]  So so you don't have wings and I do.
[4189.06s -> 4189.66s]  Ha ha ha.
[4200.38s -> 4206.30s]  OK, wait, what's happened?
[4207.06s -> 4207.82s]  Are you all right?
[4208.70s -> 4209.46s]  My apologies.
[4209.46s -> 4211.02s]  I fear I have said far too much.
[4211.34s -> 4212.46s]  Is there anything you do not understand?
[4212.46s -> 4213.46s]  Please do not hesitate.
[4215.46s -> 4218.26s]  All right, let's go.
[4220.74s -> 4223.93s]  Or is that that's nothing I can literally.
[4224.29s -> 4227.33s]  I can fly there very easily.
[4229.62s -> 4232.18s]  Let me get the shrine, though.
[4233.81s -> 4236.39s]  I don't want to have to run back here.
[4238.00s -> 4238.52s]  Where is it?
[4239.08s -> 4242.99s]  It's beeping.
[4242.99s -> 4243.63s]  Where is it, though?
[4247.96s -> 4249.16s]  Back seaters, I need your help.
[4251.98s -> 4252.50s]  Oh, there it is.
[4255.43s -> 4256.67s]  Stop wasting time.
[4256.67s -> 4258.07s]  I am not wasting time.
[4258.07s -> 4259.15s]  I've got plenty of time.
[4260.52s -> 4261.52s]  I've got two.
[4261.68s -> 4263.96s]  I've got two full hours.
[4267.69s -> 4270.17s]  There might even be time to have a snack.
[4277.62s -> 4278.22s]  OK, cool.
[4280.58s -> 4281.74s]  Then we got to go that way.
[4282.74s -> 4283.54s]  You know what I'm doing?
[4285.79s -> 4288.03s]  I need to cook this food, though.
[4289.19s -> 4290.79s]  I need a fire to cook the food,
[4290.79s -> 4291.83s]  even though I do have some.
[4291.95s -> 4292.91s]  I do have some meals.
[4294.22s -> 4295.10s]  Wait, are you going to tell me
[4295.10s -> 4295.58s]  that I can do this?
[4296.48s -> 4297.40s]  I don't want to hear a story.
[4297.40s -> 4297.84s]  I'm sorry.
[4300.09s -> 4300.97s]  I don't think I can make that.
[4302.72s -> 4303.32s]  Give him up top.
[4307.58s -> 4308.10s]  What?
[4309.69s -> 4310.21s]  I don't know.
[4310.93s -> 4312.01s]  But now all of a sudden,
[4312.01s -> 4312.69s]  you guys don't care
[4312.69s -> 4313.73s]  about the time constraint.
[4315.11s -> 4317.07s]  Five seconds ago, it was hurry up.
[4317.39s -> 4318.27s]  Hurry up, dummy.
[4318.99s -> 4320.11s]  And now all of a sudden it's
[4320.11s -> 4321.23s]  I want to hear the story.
[4330.49s -> 4331.05s]  Can I make this?
[4334.78s -> 4335.70s]  I think I can get up here.
[4336.91s -> 4339.64s]  I promise this will shave time somehow.
[4344.07s -> 4345.19s]  I promise this will shave
[4345.19s -> 4345.83s]  a little bit of time
[4352.34s -> 4353.50s]  so we get a place where I can stand,
[4353.50s -> 4355.06s]  which I think I think I can stand up here.
[4361.74s -> 4362.66s]  Looks like I can, right?
[4365.30s -> 4366.22s]  Sometimes it lets you just.
[4368.06s -> 4368.58s]  It's not.
[4369.38s -> 4370.06s]  Come on, right there.
[4370.06s -> 4370.66s]  There's a lip right here.
[4397.54s -> 4398.74s]  OK, now from here,
[4398.74s -> 4399.62s]  I'm going to glide across
[4399.62s -> 4400.22s]  the entire thing
[4401.14s -> 4416.13s]  and walk on this for sure.
[4417.21s -> 4418.96s]  I can't. No way.
[4419.92s -> 4421.00s]  I can definitely walk right there.
[4424.04s -> 4425.20s]  No way I can definitely land on that.
[4428.90s -> 4433.27s]  Good. And now
[4433.95s -> 4434.87s]  I don't need to go all the way up.
[4436.51s -> 4437.55s]  I just wanted to do this.
[4459.92s -> 4460.80s]  I definitely shaved off
[4460.80s -> 4461.80s]  some time it had to over.
[4474.61s -> 4475.65s]  You would have made it without climbing.
[4475.65s -> 4476.29s]  I don't think I would have.
[4477.41s -> 4478.45s]  I just jumped off that dock.
[4481.02s -> 4481.82s]  Look at that. And here we are.
[4486.25s -> 4487.17s]  OK, so here's the thing.
[4487.17s -> 4488.89s]  If I do beat, if I OK,
[4489.13s -> 4490.09s]  if I get to Ganon
[4491.18s -> 4492.46s]  with an hour remaining,
[4492.46s -> 4493.26s]  maybe I have enough time
[4493.26s -> 4494.18s]  to load those shrines.
[4501.95s -> 4503.03s]  OK, we got that.
[4503.03s -> 4503.47s]  Here we go.
[4504.23s -> 4505.23s]  I do want to heal.
[4505.89s -> 4507.13s]  That's definitely smart.
[4507.25s -> 4508.25s]  What food can I eat?
[4508.25s -> 4508.85s]  That's not going to
[4509.93s -> 4510.85s]  this is just cold resist.
[4510.85s -> 4511.85s]  I should eat this right now.
[4513.37s -> 4514.37s]  Low level cold resist.
[4514.37s -> 4515.13s]  I get the hearts back.
[4517.45s -> 4517.85s]  Why not?
[4518.51s -> 4518.99s]  I'm going to eat it.
[4523.14s -> 4526.41s]  Oh, I got the master sword.
[4529.89s -> 4531.85s]  I got targets to shoot at.
[4541.88s -> 4542.80s]  Hyrule Castle is going to
[4542.80s -> 4544.12s]  take him two days.
[4546.81s -> 4547.49s]  No, it's not.
[4549.94s -> 4550.74s]  And a free bow.
[4553.77s -> 4554.85s]  All right. So what bow
[4554.85s -> 4555.97s]  do I have right now
[4555.97s -> 4557.13s]  that I just need to get rid of?
[4558.05s -> 4559.45s]  Which is the worst bow that I have.
[4560.92s -> 4561.68s]  This thing's almost dead.
[4561.68s -> 4562.88s]  So why not just use it?
[4571.66s -> 4572.22s]  Cook the wheat.
[4572.22s -> 4573.18s]  Yeah, I'll cook all the food here.
[4573.22s -> 4573.58s]  Yeah.
[4576.18s -> 4576.54s]  Hmm.
[4578.50s -> 4579.30s]  I need to find this person.
[4580.93s -> 4582.01s]  I don't know you.
[4582.61s -> 4584.45s]  And I'm actually pretty busy here.
[4584.73s -> 4586.05s]  You should probably go.
[4599.45s -> 4604.47s]  I'm going to cook and put some
[4604.91s -> 4605.23s]  some.
[4605.87s -> 4606.47s]  It doesn't matter.
[4609.62s -> 4610.66s]  So many materials.
[4611.50s -> 4612.50s]  And I just buy a bunch of wheat.
[4612.54s -> 4612.90s]  Where is it?
[4619.89s -> 4620.65s]  There's a little bit of butter.
[4629.39s -> 4630.03s]  One of these.
[4631.50s -> 4632.34s]  Another one of these.
[4632.66s -> 4632.90s]  Sure.
[4633.06s -> 4633.34s]  Why not?
[4648.51s -> 4651.19s]  Oh, and I'll do that one more time.
[4651.86s -> 4652.22s]  I have another.
[4652.50s -> 4653.02s]  I have a couple.
[4662.58s -> 4663.18s]  I just want the heart.
[4669.70s -> 4672.55s]  Up in there.
[4674.10s -> 4674.46s]  All right.
[4674.90s -> 4677.27s]  I I don't care about cooking.
[4677.27s -> 4677.95s]  I have I have.
[4678.23s -> 4678.63s]  I'll beat it.
[4682.23s -> 4682.47s]  All right.
[4682.47s -> 4683.11s]  So what's the deal here?
[4695.06s -> 4695.62s]  My name's Link.
[4700.44s -> 4701.52s]  Oh, by the way, stay tuned
[4701.72s -> 4702.84s]  because I'm going to be beating
[4702.84s -> 4705.28s]  punch out every regular circuit
[4705.56s -> 4707.20s]  without falling down more than once.
[4707.92s -> 4708.80s]  So if you want to see that,
[4709.20s -> 4709.96s]  I would stay tuned.
[4713.92s -> 4715.64s]  That's when the the lower right
[4715.64s -> 4718.36s]  corner of me with my arms crossed
[4718.88s -> 4720.40s]  kind of superimposed green screen
[4720.40s -> 4721.04s]  in the bottom right.
[4722.21s -> 4724.05s]  It's like and at eight o'clock
[4724.05s -> 4727.42s]  central, the punch out challenge.
[4728.78s -> 4729.46s]  And then it goes away
[4729.46s -> 4730.30s]  after like 10 seconds.
[4737.37s -> 4738.29s]  You should take your time.
[4743.42s -> 4743.78s]  OK.
[4744.63s -> 4746.03s]  Once Divine Beast Van Madoe
[4746.03s -> 4747.55s]  falls from the sky.
[4748.07s -> 4749.94s]  If I have to kill Madoe, so be it.
[4752.47s -> 4752.75s]  All right.
[4752.79s -> 4753.19s]  Let's go.
[4753.71s -> 4754.07s]  We can do it.
[4759.70s -> 4760.46s]  As the elder said,
[4760.62s -> 4761.66s]  the only way to stop
[4761.66s -> 4763.10s]  Divine Beast Van Madoe
[4763.10s -> 4764.34s]  is to get inside of it.
[4765.10s -> 4766.10s]  Bad chance of that happening.
[4766.10s -> 4767.86s]  There's no way we can set foot in Madoe.
[4768.72s -> 4769.72s]  Actually.
[4770.20s -> 4771.60s]  Wait, did I actually this guy?
[4773.26s -> 4774.58s]  So not only are you wingless,
[4774.58s -> 4775.78s]  you're brainless, too.
[4781.12s -> 4782.72s]  Oh, I am one of the five champions.
[4783.12s -> 4783.80s]  Let me tell you.
[4784.12s -> 4787.20s]  It hadn't been Ganon.
[4788.00s -> 4788.36s]  Never mind.
[4788.36s -> 4790.68s]  Let's focus on bringing down Madoe
[4790.68s -> 4791.88s]  one step at a time.
[4792.16s -> 4793.52s]  If we approach Madoe recklessly,
[4793.52s -> 4795.28s]  its cannons will blast us out of the sky
[4795.28s -> 4796.24s]  before we can even get close.
[4797.69s -> 4798.77s]  I need to test you
[4798.77s -> 4799.77s]  before I can take you with me.
[4801.43s -> 4803.43s]  We Rito warriors use the updraft
[4803.55s -> 4804.51s]  in this ravine
[4804.83s -> 4806.67s]  to hone our aerial archery skills.
[4808.50s -> 4809.70s]  The updrafts are so strong here
[4809.70s -> 4810.38s]  that a person could.
[4810.38s -> 4811.46s]  I'm going to fail this a lot.
[4811.82s -> 4813.58s]  So you just leave.
[4819.84s -> 4820.80s]  Some of you are debating.
[4821.82s -> 4822.98s]  Some of you are debating on like,
[4822.98s -> 4824.10s]  oh, man, maybe he'll get this done
[4824.10s -> 4824.90s]  in like 30 minutes.
[4826.68s -> 4827.44s]  Now is the time for you
[4827.44s -> 4828.40s]  just to go do laundry
[4829.04s -> 4831.20s]  or make lunch or something or dinner.
[4832.35s -> 4832.91s]  When you come back,
[4832.91s -> 4833.79s]  I'll still be here, don't worry.
[4835.63s -> 4836.31s]  All right, the updrafts
[4836.31s -> 4837.55s]  are so strong here that you can.
[4837.83s -> 4838.35s]  Yeah, yeah.
[4839.35s -> 4842.10s]  Let's go destroy all five targets
[4842.10s -> 4843.10s]  in three hours.
[4844.26s -> 4844.62s]  You got it.
[4861.86s -> 4862.82s]  I just shot three.
[4863.02s -> 4863.66s]  Hold on a minute.
[4863.66s -> 4864.78s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4864.78s -> 4866.10s]  I don't want to shoot three arrows
[4866.10s -> 4867.34s]  at the same fucking time.
[4867.70s -> 4869.06s]  I want to shoot one arrow.
[4870.41s -> 4870.93s]  How do I go back?
[4875.07s -> 4875.95s]  It only uses one.
[4876.94s -> 4892.82s]  Oh, I can think broken my hands.
[4896.30s -> 4897.46s]  What's the second worst bow?
[4899.55s -> 4899.91s]  This one.
[4910.24s -> 4910.72s]  Perfect.
[4914.35s -> 4915.11s]  I really hope that wasn't
[4915.11s -> 4915.95s]  shooting more than one arrow.
[4916.27s -> 4928.07s]  Uh-huh.
[4928.07s -> 4929.35s]  You must have seen a battle or two.
[4929.51s -> 4930.19s]  I've seen a few.
[4930.19s -> 4931.63s]  It's not brag here.
[4932.70s -> 4933.74s]  I can tell just by looking at you.
[4933.74s -> 4934.54s]  Don't be modest.
[4935.53s -> 4936.73s]  You'll have heard the name somewhere.
[4936.73s -> 4937.17s]  Link.
[4938.17s -> 4938.85s]  Well, if you really want to
[4938.85s -> 4939.89s]  help me bring down Madoa,
[4939.89s -> 4940.85s]  it's now or never.
[4941.33s -> 4942.60s]  Let's get you into position
[4942.60s -> 4943.64s]  so you can give its cannons
[4943.64s -> 4944.24s]  all you got.
[4944.24s -> 4944.60s]  All right.
[4945.70s -> 4946.86s]  Inside that treasure
[4946.86s -> 4948.74s]  chest is a bow I've modified.
[4948.74s -> 4949.50s]  Take it and let me know
[4949.50s -> 4949.98s]  when you're ready.
[4955.40s -> 4956.24s]  Falcon bow.
[4956.98s -> 4959.30s]  Highly refined Rito made bow
[4959.30s -> 4961.22s]  created by a master Rito craftsman.
[4961.62s -> 4962.98s]  Rito Warriors favorite
[4962.98s -> 4964.42s]  for its superior rate of fire.
[4964.50s -> 4966.48s]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[4971.19s -> 4971.99s]  This thing's awesome.
[4971.99s -> 4972.51s]  Look at this thing.
[4976.81s -> 4977.89s]  OK, is it on fire now?
[4978.29s -> 4979.05s]  Were there arrows in here?
[4979.05s -> 4980.49s]  I could take or take them already.
[4981.96s -> 4982.36s]  Free bow.
[4986.32s -> 4986.88s]  All right, I'm ready.
[4987.52s -> 4987.92s]  Let's go.
[4990.20s -> 4990.80s]  You guys ready?
[4993.62s -> 4994.70s]  I need bomb arrows.
[4994.70s -> 4995.06s]  All right.
[4998.44s -> 4999.64s]  You just give me 20 of these.
[4999.64s -> 5001.20s]  These things that you just gave me
[5002.65s -> 5003.85s]  like five grand.
[5006.80s -> 5007.44s]  I'm good.
[5007.44s -> 5008.60s]  I already got food in me.
[5008.60s -> 5010.40s]  I've already got good clothes on.
[5012.53s -> 5013.25s]  Why are you doing this?
[5013.25s -> 5014.85s]  Why risk your life to bring down the dough?
[5016.13s -> 5022.42s]  Or it's for a bet to rescue Zelda.
[5023.06s -> 5023.98s]  The name of the princess
[5023.98s -> 5025.94s]  Revelle served 100 years ago
[5025.94s -> 5026.90s]  at Hyrule Castle.
[5032.02s -> 5032.58s]  As long as you're helping me
[5032.58s -> 5033.34s]  bring down the dough,
[5033.62s -> 5034.94s]  your motivation is fine by me.
[5035.46s -> 5037.44s]  Let's go.
[5037.44s -> 5038.40s]  All right, so let's do it.
[5038.92s -> 5040.16s]  Let me save the game first.
[5043.04s -> 5045.08s]  This is all about just landing shots.
[5045.08s -> 5045.88s]  I'm going to try really hard.
[5045.88s -> 5046.56s]  I'm not going to fuck around.
[5054.94s -> 5056.14s]  OK, just hit the targets.
[5056.42s -> 5057.14s]  It's showtime.
[5059.40s -> 5062.04s]  OK, so what do I need to hit the cannons?
[5065.38s -> 5066.58s]  There's divine beast,
[5066.58s -> 5067.62s]  Ven Madoe,
[5068.70s -> 5070.30s]  and it has its barrier up again.
[5070.30s -> 5071.02s]  What a pain.
[5071.66s -> 5073.35s]  It's wrong to scared.
[5076.58s -> 5077.74s]  See those cannons?
[5077.98s -> 5079.50s]  I'll draw their fire.
[5080.18s -> 5080.74s]  While I'm doing that,
[5080.74s -> 5081.58s]  use your bomb arrows
[5081.58s -> 5082.50s]  to destroy the cannons.
[5082.50s -> 5082.82s]  Got it.
[5083.06s -> 5083.38s]  I got it.
[5084.66s -> 5086.18s]  If you need to withdraw for a bit,
[5086.18s -> 5087.62s]  just spread your cloth
[5087.62s -> 5088.94s]  and float straight up
[5088.94s -> 5090.30s]  into the updraft for a while.
[5090.54s -> 5091.42s]  I'll take that as a sign
[5091.42s -> 5092.38s]  that we need to regroup.
[5092.98s -> 5094.26s]  Don't bother aiming for anything
[5094.26s -> 5095.34s]  covered by the barrier.
[5096.18s -> 5096.86s]  Whatever you do,
[5096.86s -> 5098.30s]  don't get close enough to touch it.
[5099.38s -> 5100.30s]  Well, that would be on you
[5101.47s -> 5102.43s]  because I'm not the one.
[5102.63s -> 5103.67s]  You're I'm on.
[5104.07s -> 5104.87s]  I'm on top of you.
[5105.11s -> 5105.31s]  All right.
[5105.31s -> 5106.87s]  Finally, I know I said this a few times.
[5107.47s -> 5108.27s]  I have cold on.
[5111.22s -> 5111.66s]  Let's go.
[5114.77s -> 5116.01s]  Now blow up those cannons.
[5116.53s -> 5117.81s]  What the fuck is happening?
[5122.69s -> 5123.45s]  Can you come back?
[5124.99s -> 5125.83s]  Holding up OK.
[5126.07s -> 5127.03s]  Get over here.
[5127.31s -> 5127.95s]  Why did I come?
[5127.95s -> 5128.95s]  Why did I fall off?
[5133.20s -> 5133.96s]  Let's go.
[5133.96s -> 5135.40s]  Why did I jump off?
[5135.96s -> 5136.60s]  It's on you.
[5136.60s -> 5137.56s]  What is happening?
[5137.64s -> 5138.76s]  I thought I was supposed
[5138.76s -> 5139.64s]  to be riding on him.
[5145.11s -> 5145.71s]  How do I change?
[5146.63s -> 5148.71s]  How do I change the arrow
[5148.71s -> 5158.60s]  that I have missing?
[5168.32s -> 5168.88s]  Is it alive?
[5169.60s -> 5170.08s]  That's it.
[5170.44s -> 5170.84s]  OK, we're good.
[5171.52s -> 5172.84s]  I thought I was staying on his back.
[5175.66s -> 5177.74s]  I was feeling there.
[5189.56s -> 5190.72s]  You can't hit the shit in the air,
[5190.72s -> 5191.40s]  can you know?
[5197.29s -> 5198.13s]  Oh, sorry.
[5198.13s -> 5198.77s]  Did you miss?
[5199.69s -> 5200.45s]  He's shit.
[5206.93s -> 5207.69s]  One of the top, maybe.
[5216.67s -> 5217.15s]  I think I can probably
[5217.15s -> 5217.63s]  hit this from here.
[5218.23s -> 5218.79s]  I aim it right.
[5227.61s -> 5228.21s]  I'll do the same thing.
[5228.21s -> 5228.77s]  I said, you know,
[5232.76s -> 5233.60s]  I think I can hit it from here.
[5240.42s -> 5242.82s]  Yeah, I got it.
[5254.78s -> 5255.26s]  Is that all of them?
[5255.26s -> 5255.74s]  Or is there one more?
[5256.54s -> 5257.38s]  Somewhere in the front, I bet.
[5257.38s -> 5278.23s]  Yep, let's go.
[5282.30s -> 5283.46s]  Now he's going to get inside, right?
[5298.26s -> 5299.02s]  Well done, Link.
[5300.38s -> 5301.66s]  That thing is history.
[5303.02s -> 5304.26s]  That's a two hour puzzle session.
[5305.22s -> 5306.54s]  Oh, coming up, you mean.
[5313.03s -> 5314.67s]  It'll be 45 minutes to beat this.
[5316.99s -> 5317.39s]  Whatever.
[5318.74s -> 5319.94s]  This one doesn't look that big.
[5322.82s -> 5325.42s]  This does not look as large
[5325.42s -> 5326.38s]  as the other ones were inside.
[5327.06s -> 5335.74s]  News, Link.
[5336.22s -> 5337.02s]  Looks like I got hit
[5337.02s -> 5338.06s]  pretty good back there.
[5339.06s -> 5340.90s]  I think I think I need to get back
[5340.90s -> 5341.90s]  to the flight doesn't know.
[5341.90s -> 5342.98s]  Is this actually a Pepe laugh?
[5342.98s -> 5343.98s]  That's I just hope that
[5344.38s -> 5345.34s]  I can make it back.
[5345.94s -> 5347.26s]  You head down to me.
[5347.26s -> 5352.98s]  Look, it's all you.
[5353.66s -> 5363.70s]  Pepe laugh.
[5378.27s -> 5378.95s]  Remember, can you wish me
[5378.95s -> 5380.43s]  a good day at school today?
[5389.85s -> 5391.69s]  Take a day off school.
[5397.16s -> 5398.68s]  Someday the weekend.
[5399.80s -> 5400.76s]  You mean for tomorrow?
[5400.76s -> 5403.00s]  Well, now I've seen that face before.
[5405.51s -> 5407.47s]  I had a feeling you would show up
[5407.47s -> 5409.47s]  eventually, but making me
[5409.55s -> 5412.63s]  probably five years is a bit indulgent.
[5412.63s -> 5413.51s]  Sunday school.
[5413.91s -> 5416.31s]  Have a good day at Sunday school.
[5420.33s -> 5422.93s]  You're I'm against clock right now.
[5422.93s -> 5423.73s]  Hold on, correct?
[5426.83s -> 5428.43s]  If so, then the first thing
[5428.43s -> 5430.03s]  you'll want to do is find yourself.
[5430.23s -> 5432.07s]  He thinks America is the only country.
[5433.56s -> 5437.67s]  It's EU is not in school right now.
[5438.49s -> 5440.61s]  Maybe Asia, Australia,
[5442.37s -> 5444.33s]  Australia from here is plus 14.
[5444.93s -> 5445.61s]  I don't think it's it.
[5445.89s -> 5447.29s]  I don't think it's school time for Australia.
[5451.06s -> 5452.58s]  Is it where you wait?
[5452.58s -> 5454.18s]  It is like it's like 6 a.m.
[5454.18s -> 5455.42s]  right now in Australia.
[5457.70s -> 5458.70s]  Hey, OK.
[5459.59s -> 5462.66s]  Hey, have a good day at school.
[5474.42s -> 5476.02s]  OK, I'm I got to I got to play.
[5476.98s -> 5479.10s]  So do we have to do
[5479.10s -> 5480.26s]  anything weird with this one?
[5484.36s -> 5485.28s]  Divine, because there's
[5485.28s -> 5487.08s]  no weird shit to do.
[5487.60s -> 5488.12s]  It's not like, oh,
[5488.12s -> 5489.40s]  I have to move the elephant.
[5490.00s -> 5490.60s]  Whatever I have to move
[5490.60s -> 5491.48s]  the trunk up and down.
[5491.48s -> 5492.64s]  It's not anything like that, right?
[5493.16s -> 5496.86s]  And I want that, whatever that is.
[5503.22s -> 5504.86s]  I have to just touch all those things.
[5507.74s -> 5512.58s]  I mean, all the way up.
[5512.94s -> 5517.86s]  It's up here.
[5518.02s -> 5519.14s]  I can keep going up
[5525.42s -> 5527.30s]  and I open the map of the.
[5527.34s -> 5528.10s]  I don't think I can.
[5531.75s -> 5535.23s]  All right, I need to find those kiosks.
[5541.92s -> 5543.04s]  Is it not up in this top?
[5543.48s -> 5543.92s]  Oh, wait.
[5546.31s -> 5547.75s]  At what point do I go too high up
[5547.75s -> 5548.55s]  and I lose
[5549.11s -> 5550.83s]  gravity of the divine beast
[5550.83s -> 5551.35s]  or whatever it is?
[5551.47s -> 5551.95s]  Does it matter?
[5569.13s -> 5569.77s]  OK, well.
[5573.50s -> 5574.74s]  I'm just going to go down here
[5576.70s -> 5577.86s]  to get the map first.
[5577.90s -> 5579.42s]  I'm sorry I was wishing somebody
[5579.42s -> 5580.70s]  good luck in Sunday school.
[5581.42s -> 5582.82s]  I was a little distracted, sorry.
[5583.74s -> 5584.62s]  I got to go to the map room.
[5585.26s -> 5597.76s]  OK, how do you swing?
[5598.08s -> 5598.88s]  I'm going to swing.
[5606.69s -> 5607.05s]  Here we go.
[5629.06s -> 5629.82s]  Somebody just said,
[5630.18s -> 5632.62s]  what is this boring ass game?
[5634.32s -> 5635.24s]  All right, come on, dude.
[5635.82s -> 5636.74s]  You can you can.
[5636.78s -> 5638.10s]  You would think that Zelda is boring,
[5638.74s -> 5640.22s]  but you know what the game is.
[5640.62s -> 5641.18s]  Do you know what I mean?
[5641.18s -> 5642.66s]  Like you have to know what the game is.
[5644.01s -> 5645.13s]  You know, this is Zelda.
[5645.69s -> 5647.05s]  I mean, you might think the game sucks.
[5647.17s -> 5647.73s]  That's all right.
[5647.73s -> 5649.01s]  Everybody has their own games.
[5649.01s -> 5650.21s]  They like to look closely,
[5650.21s -> 5651.05s]  but it's Zelda.
[5651.29s -> 5651.89s]  You know what it is.
[5655.04s -> 5656.52s]  The terminals that will activate
[5656.52s -> 5657.56s]  Meadow are marked
[5657.56s -> 5658.92s]  by those glowing points.
[5659.85s -> 5661.05s]  You'll need to agree with him.
[5661.05s -> 5662.61s]  All of the terminals to take.
[5662.65s -> 5663.29s]  No, I would.
[5663.53s -> 5664.09s]  No, I'm just.
[5664.69s -> 5666.10s]  Think you're right.
[5666.10s -> 5667.22s]  Thanks for defending us.
[5667.86s -> 5668.22s]  I was.
[5668.30s -> 5668.98s]  Wait, people think.
[5669.30s -> 5669.98s]  Was I agreeing?
[5675.42s -> 5676.94s]  He's agreeing with him.
[5680.08s -> 5680.76s]  OK, all right.
[5680.76s -> 5681.04s]  All right.
[5681.04s -> 5681.28s]  All right.
[5681.28s -> 5682.08s]  No, we're good.
[5682.08s -> 5682.40s]  We're good.
[5682.40s -> 5682.76s]  We're good.
[5682.80s -> 5685.48s]  I have to move some things around.
[5687.09s -> 5687.61s]  Oops.
[5688.93s -> 5689.49s]  Oh, fuck.
[5689.53s -> 5690.49s]  This could take all day.
[5692.07s -> 5692.83s]  How was I ever going
[5692.83s -> 5693.63s]  to beat this in three hours?
[5704.42s -> 5705.26s]  Don't say that yet.
[5705.62s -> 5716.59s]  OK, so it's either.
[5716.83s -> 5719.09s]  OK, it's either up middle.
[5720.65s -> 5722.21s]  Tilts, you tilt it.
[5722.33s -> 5722.81s]  I get it.
[5722.81s -> 5723.89s]  So you can either tilt
[5723.89s -> 5724.73s]  left or tilt right.
[5728.14s -> 5729.70s]  Let me just take a quick look.
[5730.90s -> 5731.90s]  Oh, fuck.
[5732.66s -> 5733.46s]  Oh, no, we're good.
[5733.70s -> 5736.42s]  I don't want to shoot
[5736.42s -> 5737.26s]  bomb arrows, though.
[5738.34s -> 5745.26s]  Just.
[5748.82s -> 5749.70s]  Just go in again and do this.
[5749.70s -> 5750.66s]  No way you're going to be this puzzle.
[5751.51s -> 5752.55s]  I think no, I'm all right.
[5752.55s -> 5752.87s]  I'm all right.
[5752.87s -> 5753.71s]  I just need to actually sit here
[5753.71s -> 5755.59s]  and pay attention for real.
[5760.90s -> 5761.82s]  Can I try that?
[5765.00s -> 5765.60s]  All right, hold on.
[5771.30s -> 5772.22s]  Can I shoot that?
[5780.89s -> 5782.41s]  I'm going to I'm going to shoot this.
[5783.82s -> 5784.46s]  Save the game.
[5786.12s -> 5787.20s]  It's been a long time.
[5791.45s -> 5792.21s]  Just go to Ganon.
[5792.57s -> 5793.77s]  I mean, I'm I'm here right now.
[5795.91s -> 5797.03s]  This is a really bad idea.
[5805.85s -> 5806.73s]  I don't even know why I did that.
[5809.11s -> 5810.27s]  Is there anything I can fly up with?
[5819.78s -> 5820.14s]  Hold on.
[5820.30s -> 5822.10s]  Can I get can I grab on or something?
[5822.50s -> 5824.30s]  Oh, God, not to the helicopter, please.
[5831.62s -> 5832.10s]  OK, we're good.
[5836.37s -> 5837.25s]  So if it tells this way,
[5837.25s -> 5838.61s]  I can freeze them, I bet.
[5843.74s -> 5844.70s]  Chest down there.
[5844.70s -> 5845.74s]  I go this way.
[5850.69s -> 5851.65s]  The bird is so small.
[5851.65s -> 5855.92s]  Where is all this stuff up?
[5856.80s -> 5865.82s]  Like we're this way.
[5871.29s -> 5874.07s]  They're like in the wings.
[5876.66s -> 5878.78s]  We're in the way down below.
[5892.99s -> 5893.75s]  That gets me over here.
[5896.58s -> 5897.26s]  Why did you do that?
[5898.66s -> 5899.18s]  Look at this.
[5902.65s -> 5905.35s]  Wait, I can't walk up.
[5909.99s -> 5915.50s]  All right, so now I'm in here
[5915.50s -> 5916.50s]  and I'm going to tell it this way.
[5920.55s -> 5921.23s]  No, I did.
[5921.63s -> 5921.99s]  Yes.
[5923.07s -> 5950.40s]  So this one right up here is one.
[5956.29s -> 5958.25s]  There are four terminals remaining.
[5958.77s -> 5960.05s]  Still no ways to go.
[5965.37s -> 5965.77s]  OK.
[5967.50s -> 5969.10s]  Oh, I'm going to make it flat.
[5970.22s -> 5981.90s]  So the next one is in the left.
[5982.14s -> 5983.42s]  Is it like a little bunker
[5983.42s -> 5984.02s]  or something over here?
[5986.84s -> 5987.80s]  I'm going to get attacked, aren't I?
[5990.88s -> 5991.68s]  What are these things for?
[5998.75s -> 6002.12s]  All right, all right.
[6019.98s -> 6020.78s]  Stop the spawning.
[6022.42s -> 6022.86s]  What does this do?
[6028.90s -> 6030.34s]  OK, and open up the windows.
[6030.82s -> 6031.62s]  Get some fresh air.
[6032.62s -> 6034.90s]  That is doing what?
[6048.93s -> 6049.85s]  Is that going to stay open?
[6061.14s -> 6062.02s]  All right, hold on a second.
[6063.53s -> 6065.61s]  So if I go like this
[6066.37s -> 6070.67s]  and then which direction
[6070.67s -> 6071.43s]  should I move it this way?
[6080.34s -> 6081.50s]  Oh, shit, things are moving.
[6083.38s -> 6084.82s]  I just press this big button
[6087.02s -> 6089.66s]  and now do I close it
[6089.66s -> 6090.38s]  if I close it?
[6090.38s -> 6091.58s]  Will the no hold on
[6091.94s -> 6093.58s]  that close that gate?
[6100.23s -> 6104.62s]  What is if I close the window
[6104.90s -> 6105.98s]  that closes that?
[6106.34s -> 6108.70s]  Now this is stuck here,
[6109.99s -> 6112.40s]  which then I just I don't
[6112.84s -> 6113.64s]  what's the goal here?
[6113.80s -> 6114.24s]  I don't know.
[6115.95s -> 6116.87s]  I'm about to float out the window
[6116.87s -> 6118.63s]  to the Hyrule Castle, by the way.
[6119.77s -> 6120.77s]  I'm about to just go out the window
[6120.77s -> 6121.73s]  out, float out the window
[6121.73s -> 6122.57s]  to Hyrule Castle
[6131.84s -> 6133.16s]  because I need to get in here.
[6133.20s -> 6135.52s]  So how do I what button opens that?
[6138.36s -> 6139.20s]  And what do I have to press
[6139.20s -> 6140.24s]  to open this door?
[6149.14s -> 6150.38s]  Button's not pressed all the way.
[6164.30s -> 6165.62s]  Do I tilt the bird?
[6167.91s -> 6168.91s]  Because this presses the button
[6168.91s -> 6169.59s]  in all the way.
[6170.83s -> 6172.27s]  But what does that actually even do?
[6172.27s -> 6173.39s]  It closes this.
[6175.79s -> 6176.55s]  No, it is.
[6181.22s -> 6181.58s]  It doesn't.
[6181.58s -> 6182.70s]  It needs to go faster.
[6186.94s -> 6188.50s]  All right, I'm very confused.
[6191.04s -> 6191.88s]  I'm opening this again.
[6198.79s -> 6200.07s]  It would be blue if it was pressed.
[6200.07s -> 6201.03s]  So do I have to make it go
[6201.03s -> 6203.63s]  like super speed down?
[6203.83s -> 6204.15s]  Hold on.
[6204.15s -> 6204.63s]  What if I turn?
[6210.86s -> 6211.98s]  OK, so I have to get rid of that
[6212.46s -> 6215.13s]  because that's blocking this.
[6216.50s -> 6217.14s]  That's OK.
[6217.14s -> 6217.70s]  There it goes.
[6219.03s -> 6221.59s]  Now we make it go to the right
[6221.91s -> 6223.51s]  and it's going to be going wicked fast.
[6223.59s -> 6223.87s]  Hold on.
[6230.12s -> 6232.22s]  Oh, OK.
[6232.22s -> 6233.90s]  Now I have to freeze
[6234.90s -> 6236.02s]  my freezing the door.
[6240.24s -> 6241.48s]  What am I actually freezing here?
[6244.58s -> 6245.82s]  Freeze on the fan.
[6246.70s -> 6247.58s]  This one here, right?
[6248.90s -> 6250.46s]  And then tilt it, freeze this
[6250.46s -> 6251.50s]  so it'll move all the way over.
[6253.62s -> 6254.62s]  Freeze the metal block.
[6255.18s -> 6255.70s]  I don't think I can.
[6256.06s -> 6260.26s]  Freeze the square metal block.
[6260.54s -> 6264.10s]  So then now I tilt it
[6265.16s -> 6265.68s]  all the way up.
[6274.92s -> 6277.51s]  Oh, oh shit.
[6277.51s -> 6277.79s]  Wait.
[6284.06s -> 6284.54s]  I got it.
[6284.54s -> 6284.86s]  I got it.
[6285.22s -> 6285.70s]  I got it.
[6285.70s -> 6287.38s]  It's it's it's it's weird.
[6287.38s -> 6287.74s]  It's weird.
[6287.74s -> 6288.38s]  It's a puzzle.
[6288.38s -> 6289.02s]  It takes a minute.
[6310.59s -> 6310.99s]  Try it again.
[6313.68s -> 6318.01s]  Wait, waiting.
[6318.01s -> 6318.53s]  Keep waiting.
[6318.53s -> 6319.01s]  Keep waiting.
[6319.01s -> 6319.49s]  Keep waiting.
[6319.49s -> 6319.97s]  Keep waiting.
[6319.97s -> 6320.45s]  Keep waiting.
[6320.45s -> 6320.93s]  Keep waiting.
[6320.93s -> 6321.37s]  Keep waiting.
[6321.37s -> 6321.77s]  Keep waiting.
[6321.77s -> 6322.17s]  Keep waiting.
[6322.17s -> 6322.49s]  Keep waiting.
[6322.49s -> 6322.81s]  Keep waiting.
[6322.81s -> 6324.25s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6326.44s -> 6327.72s]  I don't get this at all.
[6329.29s -> 6329.49s]  Wait.
[6332.18s -> 6334.02s]  What what am I not getting here?
[6335.62s -> 6335.94s]  What?
[6336.62s -> 6337.78s]  I don't even need to do that at all.
[6346.36s -> 6347.68s]  What is actually happening?
[6348.84s -> 6351.24s]  What is what is making this great go down?
[6353.76s -> 6355.80s]  Does that thing have to go all the way to the other side?
[6356.04s -> 6358.88s]  I actually don't understand how this is the mechanics of how this works.
[6359.88s -> 6371.73s]  What is making the gate go up?
[6371.73s -> 6374.62s]  So turning it again this way.
[6376.46s -> 6378.22s]  Why wouldn't I want to just keep it right here?
[6384.63s -> 6386.03s]  How come it's doing that?
[6386.03s -> 6393.87s]  I just like get it.
[6393.91s -> 6400.39s]  Use the magnesis on the block so the fan can keep spinning.
[6400.47s -> 6401.51s]  Oh, it's not enough to freeze it.
[6403.26s -> 6405.02s]  I completely forgot this was an item in the game.
[6409.77s -> 6412.01s]  I completely forgot the magnet existed.
[6414.18s -> 6414.74s]  God damn it.
[6416.76s -> 6418.60s]  I literally can just go like this.
[6419.36s -> 6425.06s]  All right, well, let's try it again.
[6426.09s -> 6429.12s]  But now if I hold this, keep it right here.
[6432.38s -> 6433.30s]  Hey, look at that.
[6434.95s -> 6436.39s]  How come you keep forgetting this is in the game?
[6436.99s -> 6440.67s]  Because I do this really fun thing where I play Breath of the Wild every six months.
[6441.61s -> 6443.21s]  And then I don't play it for six months.
[6451.55s -> 6459.14s]  All right, six is generous.
[6461.61s -> 6463.53s]  There are three terminals remaining.
[6464.01s -> 6464.73s]  Keep going.
[6465.69s -> 6468.50s]  OK, can I get them all in a row?
[6471.33s -> 6471.77s]  No. All right.
[6471.77s -> 6473.45s]  We just got to get the other side.
[6473.45s -> 6478.10s]  There's three on the other side.
[6478.10s -> 6479.14s]  Turn it this way.
[6481.93s -> 6483.25s]  But what are we looking at here?
[6483.25s -> 6485.33s]  I got to get up there.
[6485.33s -> 6497.15s]  Cure that guy real quick over there.
[6503.69s -> 6506.17s]  Wait, I want that one.
[6506.17s -> 6508.05s]  I can't. I have no patience at all.
[6508.81s -> 6509.77s]  Like zero.
[6509.77s -> 6512.58s]  It's it goes to zero.
[6512.58s -> 6514.06s]  I was do I was doing it fine.
[6514.06s -> 6516.86s]  I just like my brain was like, I want to beat this so fast.
[6518.36s -> 6520.74s]  I don't want to wait for the bird to turn.
[6520.74s -> 6522.58s]  That's what was going through my head.
[6522.58s -> 6524.26s]  It's like I have to wait for the bird bird to turn.
[6524.26s -> 6525.34s]  It's going to take ten full seconds.
[6525.34s -> 6526.38s]  I don't want to wait.
[6526.38s -> 6543.18s]  OK, well, now I have to get back up there.
[6543.18s -> 6544.70s]  I got to get up there.
[6544.70s -> 6547.38s]  What's the best way to get up there?
[6547.38s -> 6549.06s]  Freezing this in the middle?
[6549.06s -> 6549.82s]  Yeah.
[6576.51s -> 6577.35s]  Then I'm going to head to the left.
[6588.19s -> 6588.71s]  Second part.
[6590.78s -> 6593.30s]  We've got you, hold on.
[6602.47s -> 6603.35s]  Get rid of the spawner.
[6603.35s -> 6605.59s]  All right, this is going to make this blow.
[6612.92s -> 6614.87s]  And what's happening?
[6614.87s -> 6623.97s]  I got to get up there.
[6623.97s -> 6625.37s]  Anything on the ceiling?
[6625.37s -> 6628.86s]  No, I think I know what to do.
[6628.86s -> 6630.26s]  Tilt it this way.
[6630.26s -> 6632.34s]  Maybe I can just fall in there.
[6633.42s -> 6635.70s]  I think I can just fall in and watch this, right?
[6635.70s -> 6646.42s]  I imagine that will work.
[6646.42s -> 6659.76s]  Will that work? Of course it does.
[6662.92s -> 6663.52s]  I almost got it.
[6663.52s -> 6664.72s]  We're good.
[6664.72s -> 6666.24s]  I think we're on pretty good pace right now.
[6666.24s -> 6669.88s]  I've got I've got more than a full hour to begin.
[6669.88s -> 6672.84s]  I'm going to have all the divine powers.
[6672.84s -> 6676.37s]  I need to get through this door.
[6676.37s -> 6677.65s]  I'm almost there.
[6682.25s -> 6690.66s]  Yeah, it doesn't blow up by itself.
[6690.66s -> 6691.18s]  Right.
[6703.03s -> 6704.55s]  How do I explain that?
[6704.55s -> 6705.55s]  I can't explain it.
[6705.55s -> 6707.07s]  Just laugh at the dumb thing I did.
[6707.07s -> 6725.37s]  OK, nice.
[6725.37s -> 6729.33s]  All right, now we put a bomb in there.
[6729.41s -> 6731.68s]  Turn that off
[6731.68s -> 6733.52s]  and we can pop that.
[6733.52s -> 6734.72s]  That's just right.
[6737.23s -> 6740.71s]  No, really?
[6740.71s -> 6742.22s]  I can't.
[6742.22s -> 6754.46s]  Well, now what do I do?
[6754.46s -> 6755.54s]  Oh, come on.
[6755.54s -> 6756.30s]  I had it.
[6756.30s -> 6757.22s]  I did it right.
[6757.22s -> 6758.54s]  I had it.
[6759.19s -> 6771.06s]  No, we want to go this way.
[6771.06s -> 6778.39s]  OK, now I got to make it go that way.
[6778.39s -> 6779.19s]  I don't think I can.
[6779.19s -> 6782.49s]  Can I make it go that way?
[6782.49s -> 6786.03s]  Wait, I can.
[6786.03s -> 6789.00s]  OK, OK.
[6791.48s -> 6792.80s]  Very cool.
[6792.80s -> 6795.76s]  Now, now we do this
[6798.79s -> 6801.11s]  and I do magnetism
[6801.83s -> 6803.15s]  through the wall.
[6805.40s -> 6807.80s]  No, I don't.
[6811.85s -> 6815.19s]  I do tilt.
[6815.47s -> 6816.51s]  Which way should I tilt?
[6816.51s -> 6817.51s]  This way?
[6817.51s -> 6818.75s]  No.
[6818.75s -> 6819.83s]  Pull it out.
[6819.83s -> 6821.71s]  I can get it here.
[6821.71s -> 6823.85s]  I'll move it this way.
[6823.85s -> 6825.61s]  Can I reach now?
[6825.61s -> 6833.62s]  Oh, get it on the track over there.
[6838.77s -> 6839.77s]  Come here.
[6845.75s -> 6848.81s]  OK, get it right here.
[6849.53s -> 6852.46s]  And we tilt it
[6853.02s -> 6868.55s]  that slam into it.
[6873.18s -> 6875.98s]  They only got this only two more.
[6876.10s -> 6878.42s]  This is actually much better than I thought it was.
[6879.58s -> 6885.06s]  We're good.
[6885.06s -> 6887.42s]  Just one terminal remaining.
[6888.94s -> 6891.86s]  What do you know?
[6891.86s -> 6893.90s]  One terminal and it's down.
[6894.54s -> 6900.78s]  It is down, down there, right below me.
[6901.97s -> 6904.99s]  OK, so what's the deal?
[6905.95s -> 6908.91s]  I think I'm going to open this and then go out of the window.
[6911.00s -> 6912.44s]  Does that sound good?
[6912.44s -> 6924.93s]  Everybody, it's right underneath me.
[6928.30s -> 6935.06s]  I'm going to save it right now.
[6935.06s -> 6936.42s]  I feel like that's correct.
[6936.42s -> 6939.58s]  It probably isn't.
[6939.58s -> 6947.77s]  Is that not correct?
[6947.77s -> 6949.29s]  No, no, go this way.
[6963.70s -> 6965.10s]  It was not correct.
[6965.10s -> 6966.18s]  I didn't know if there was like a lip
[6966.18s -> 6971.89s]  because remember, there was a little lip over there.
[6971.89s -> 6973.65s]  All right, this is where I want to be.
[6974.37s -> 6977.45s]  So not above, but down to the left over there.
[6977.45s -> 6979.53s]  OK, so what the heck is going on over here?
[6981.46s -> 6982.86s]  Let's float in there.
[6982.86s -> 6983.66s]  Let's go.
[6987.01s -> 6994.94s]  OK, I'm going to eat something.
[6994.94s -> 6996.50s]  I'm going to keep the cold resistance going.
[6996.50s -> 7005.62s]  Yeah, that'll get rid of that.
[7005.86s -> 7008.02s]  It's pre-recorded.
[7008.02s -> 7027.29s]  No, it's that way.
[7027.29s -> 7033.52s]  Is there another one of those things on track?
[7033.52s -> 7034.96s]  So I got to get in there.
[7034.96s -> 7035.52s]  So wait a minute.
[7035.52s -> 7037.78s]  Hold on. If I tilt this way,
[7037.78s -> 7041.05s]  I can probably float in there.
[7041.05s -> 7042.41s]  Ooh, I got it.
[7042.41s -> 7043.81s]  It's done. I just beat it.
[7044.33s -> 7046.45s]  And we still have an hour and 20 minutes.
[7047.17s -> 7055.78s]  I am doing just fine, by the way.
[7055.78s -> 7068.57s]  I don't think I can make it.
[7068.57s -> 7078.17s]  Yeah, yeah, that's them all.
[7078.17s -> 7079.05s]  I got them all.
[7085.80s -> 7086.96s]  Let's turn it on.
[7087.56s -> 7090.08s]  So what's the superpower you get from the bird?
[7101.87s -> 7103.15s]  Right in the middle.
[7106.63s -> 7108.16s]  This one wasn't that bad.
[7108.16s -> 7109.32s]  This one was fun.
[7110.58s -> 7111.70s]  This was a lot shorter
[7111.70s -> 7113.86s]  than the other ones, it seems like.
[7113.86s -> 7115.46s]  I liked it, though. It was fun.
[7115.46s -> 7133.14s]  Can I make this?
[7133.14s -> 7142.15s]  OK. All the way up.
[7142.15s -> 7145.26s]  Longer than the lizard, at least.
[7145.26s -> 7146.10s]  Did I hate the lizard?
[7146.10s -> 7150.30s]  I thought.
[7150.30s -> 7152.18s]  I should probably get to full health.
[7152.18s -> 7157.63s]  This is a boss.
[7157.99s -> 7159.87s]  Or close to full health.
[7165.27s -> 7167.98s]  All right. Get the master sword out.
[7167.98s -> 7173.09s]  It's not out already.
[7173.09s -> 7174.81s]  Master sword is here.
[7174.81s -> 7175.89s]  60 damage.
[7175.89s -> 7178.22s]  Holy shit.
[7178.26s -> 7180.26s]  And what do I have for a bow?
[7180.92s -> 7182.64s]  Falcon bow, that's fine.
[7182.64s -> 7186.58s]  What do I have for arrows?
[7186.58s -> 7187.66s]  I have a lot of bomb arrows
[7187.66s -> 7188.90s]  and maybe I'll use them.
[7190.78s -> 7194.00s]  OK, well, that was annoying.
[7194.00s -> 7198.30s]  All right, are we ready? Let's go.
[7198.30s -> 7213.58s]  How do I turn it on?
[7213.58s -> 7214.82s]  Cannon.
[7215.50s -> 7220.58s]  Save the bombs for cannon.
[7220.58s -> 7223.45s]  I have to get a picture of that for sure.
[7245.78s -> 7246.78s]  OK.
[7250.02s -> 7253.26s]  Defeated me a hundred years ago.
[7253.26s -> 7256.02s]  Well, you see, when I played six months ago,
[7256.46s -> 7257.34s]  you know, I was OK.
[7257.34s -> 7257.98s]  I was good back then,
[7257.98s -> 7259.06s]  but I forgot how the game played.
[7259.06s -> 7260.46s]  I forgot the controls.
[7260.46s -> 7262.70s]  So it's your turn now.
[7263.22s -> 7264.58s]  I haven't played Breath of the Wild
[7264.58s -> 7267.02s]  in fucking a hundred years, Link.
[7274.61s -> 7296.14s]  Dodge?
[7296.14s -> 7298.36s]  These don't really hurt that much.
[7298.36s -> 7307.38s]  Ow.
[7307.38s -> 7311.81s]  I need to eat something.
[7311.81s -> 7313.95s]  What do I even have for food?
[7313.95s -> 7315.19s]  I got this.
[7324.39s -> 7327.46s]  I feel like I should have wasted all of this, but I did.
[7327.46s -> 7328.18s]  All right. No more.
[7328.18s -> 7328.90s]  OK, bomb arrows.
[7328.90s -> 7330.18s]  I'm not using them.
[7341.97s -> 7342.97s]  Where is he?
[7344.14s -> 7349.46s]  I just needed a complete 160 degrees
[7350.92s -> 7352.84s]  with 200 added on top of that.
[7358.18s -> 7359.42s]  Can I bring him down?
[7359.86s -> 7367.09s]  I feel like you have to see the gun or something.
[7367.09s -> 7375.94s]  Where is he?
[7375.94s -> 7390.82s]  Where even is this guy?
[7390.82s -> 7391.90s]  And why are you talking to me
[7391.90s -> 7393.98s]  like in the middle of a fight like this?
[7394.54s -> 7406.80s]  More food. What is this?
[7406.80s -> 7407.92s]  Oh, this is this is not good.
[7407.92s -> 7409.92s]  I have to dodge like everything.
[7409.92s -> 7433.51s]  Excuse me?
[7433.51s -> 7435.23s]  And what kind of crack
[7435.23s -> 7440.42s]  is this game smoking right now?
[7440.42s -> 7441.22s]  What?
[7446.98s -> 7450.62s]  I can't hurt him in the middle of that?
[7450.62s -> 7453.51s]  What the fuck was that?
[7453.51s -> 7455.31s]  I almost want to start over.
[7455.31s -> 7457.38s]  Yeah, I'm starting over.
[7457.38s -> 7458.14s]  What are we going to do?
[7458.14s -> 7458.70s]  Yeah, I got it.
[7458.70s -> 7459.10s]  I got it.
[7459.10s -> 7459.34s]  I got it.
[7459.34s -> 7459.90s]  I got it.
[7459.90s -> 7466.06s]  I just want to give him false insecurity.
[7466.06s -> 7482.72s]  I'm going to fucking crush him.
[7482.72s -> 7499.46s]  Land on top of him, please.
[7499.46s -> 7500.26s]  You're out of arrows?
[7500.26s -> 7506.63s]  No, I got arrows.
[7507.90s -> 7509.70s]  I don't know what the fuck that is.
[7514.27s -> 7515.27s]  Shoot?
[7516.27s -> 7520.14s]  All right, I need the, I need the gas thing.
[7520.14s -> 7521.54s]  No, go this way.
[7527.23s -> 7528.63s]  Shoot, what are you doing?
[7528.63s -> 7529.99s]  Why will you not shoot this?
[7529.99s -> 7532.23s]  No, you don't have a bow and arrow.
[7533.31s -> 7536.51s]  What are you talking about?
[7565.90s -> 7566.90s]  He was like,
[7566.90s -> 7568.54s]  Ah, now's my chance.
[7568.54s -> 7569.78s]  Yeah, it is.
[7575.57s -> 7578.65s]  OK, he would have been so funny
[7578.65s -> 7581.34s]  if he died of his health at zero.
[7581.34s -> 7582.54s]  This would be one of the best games
[7582.62s -> 7584.26s]  I've ever played in my entire life.
[7584.26s -> 7585.18s]  That happened.
[7603.78s -> 7605.98s]  We still have an hour and 20 minutes.
[7605.98s -> 7607.58s]  We still have an hour and 20 minutes.
[7607.58s -> 7608.98s]  Everyone, everyone relax.
[7608.98s -> 7610.14s]  Everybody just settle down.
[7610.14s -> 7612.44s]  We've got an hour and 20 minutes,
[7612.44s -> 7619.80s]  at least.
[7619.80s -> 7622.22s]  Can you imagine if I looked over the edge?
[7622.22s -> 7623.70s]  He was just falling.
[7623.70s -> 7626.32s]  I could tell the whole time
[7626.32s -> 7627.96s]  dark souls died on the ground.
[7627.96s -> 7635.80s]  That would have been probably my favorite thing
[7635.80s -> 7645.63s]  I've ever seen in a game.
[7645.63s -> 7647.63s]  Enemies do that in Tears of the Kingdom.
[7647.63s -> 7664.82s]  Nice.
[7664.82s -> 7667.25s]  Will that bring me to two rows?
[7667.25s -> 7674.12s]  Maybe.
[7674.12s -> 7676.10s]  Heart container.
[7676.10s -> 7678.44s]  Oh, that's too bad.
[7687.49s -> 7688.49s]  Yeah, right.
[7692.97s -> 7694.69s]  One row, Andy.
[7694.69s -> 7696.25s]  I know it's bad, but it's not that bad.
[7696.25s -> 7697.01s]  It's fine.
[7712.21s -> 7714.69s]  Yeah, we can't skip the major cutscenes.
[7714.69s -> 7717.74s]  I'm going to see these.
[7717.74s -> 7721.64s]  Oh, look, it's Revelli.
[7721.64s -> 7723.35s]  Revelli.
[7723.35s -> 7724.23s]  Well done.
[7724.23s -> 7725.23s]  Well done, Revelli.
[7733.30s -> 7736.75s]  Don't preen yourself just for doing your job.
[7736.75s -> 7740.23s]  I do suppose you've proven your value as a warrior.
[7740.23s -> 7742.95s]  A warrior worthy of my unique ability.
[7742.95s -> 7743.79s]  And what is it?
[7743.79s -> 7764.21s]  The secret skill that I have dubbed Revelli's Gale.
[7764.21s -> 7765.86s]  Super jump.
[7765.86s -> 7767.34s]  It's now time to move on
[7767.34s -> 7771.54s]  and start making preparations for Meadow Strike on Ganon.
[7771.54s -> 7772.38s]  Good.
[7772.38s -> 7773.22s]  Crazy good.
[7773.22s -> 7774.06s]  Do you still need my help
[7774.06s -> 7775.62s]  while you're fighting inside Hyrule Castle?
[7775.62s -> 7776.46s]  I have them all.
[7776.46s -> 7777.30s]  I have all the powers.
[7777.30s -> 7782.95s]  Feel free to thank me now.
[7782.95s -> 7786.74s]  Or never watch us go.
[7786.74s -> 7787.58s]  You should have done this one way earlier.
[7787.58s -> 7790.06s]  Your job is far from finished, you know.
[7790.06s -> 7804.54s]  The princess has been waiting in awe.
[7804.54s -> 7807.40s]  It's very, very good.
[7807.40s -> 7814.87s]  Most people do this one first.
[7814.87s -> 7815.87s]  Six months.
[7820.02s -> 7821.74s]  He did this one last laughing.
[7821.74s -> 7822.58s]  Why?
[7824.06s -> 7825.10s]  You don't have, there's no order.
[7825.10s -> 7828.06s]  I thought that you guys told me two years ago
[7828.06s -> 7830.14s]  when I started this
[7830.14s -> 7832.10s]  that it didn't matter what order I did.
[7847.49s -> 7849.89s]  I kind of want to make the title of the stream.
[7850.97s -> 7853.33s]  Playing through Breath of the Wild again.
[7853.33s -> 7855.69s]  And then in parentheses, I don't do sequels.
[7869.81s -> 7871.77s]  No, I'm not playing the new one.
[7871.77s -> 7873.81s]  This is the original one.
[7873.81s -> 7874.65s]  I'm playing the new one.
[7874.65s -> 7875.49s]  I don't do sequels.
[7875.49s -> 7877.21s]  I don't watch movie sequels either.
[7877.21s -> 7878.77s]  I have no idea what happens in Star Wars.
[7878.77s -> 7882.22s]  Meadow sights are now set.
[7882.22s -> 7884.06s]  You'll have a precise speed on Ganon
[7884.06s -> 7885.82s]  from this vantage point.
[7885.82s -> 7890.72s]  When the time is right, give him everything you've got.
[7890.76s -> 7891.60s]  What about Diablo II?
[7891.60s -> 7893.56s]  Now we wait for that perfect moment.
[7895.94s -> 7900.66s]  Meadow, we've been artfully patient for the last 100 years.
[7900.66s -> 7903.78s]  I doubt you'll suffer a feather over a few more moments.
[7903.78s -> 7904.62s]  What about TF2?
[7911.63s -> 7915.75s]  After all these years, I simply must admit the truth.
[7915.75s -> 7917.87s]  Even without the power of flight,
[7917.87s -> 7920.27s]  Link made his way to this divine beast
[7920.27s -> 7922.83s]  and accomplished something that even I could not.
[7924.33s -> 7926.81s]  Guess I was wrong about how lucky I was.
[7926.85s -> 7928.09s]  No, they actually changed it.
[7928.09s -> 7929.37s]  Nice.
[7929.37s -> 7930.21s]  I hope that-
[7930.21s -> 7932.13s]  Your favorite movie is Gremlins 2.
[7932.13s -> 7940.05s]  Well, that makes it funnier.
[7940.05s -> 7944.54s]  Armored Core 6.
[7944.54s -> 7946.90s]  That's, there's many sequels in front of that.
[7956.22s -> 7957.66s]  Blustrous power born from the spirit
[7957.66s -> 7959.80s]  of the champion, Revali.
[7959.80s -> 7962.84s]  Creates an upward draft that carries you into the sky.
[7962.84s -> 7966.09s]  Activate by charging jump with B.
[7966.09s -> 7969.60s]  Link.
[7969.60s -> 7970.44s]  Link.
[7970.44s -> 7973.29s]  Is she under the boards?
[7973.29s -> 7975.98s]  Link, thanks to you.
[7975.98s -> 7976.82s]  Oh.
[7976.82s -> 7979.94s]  Both the divine beasts have returned to us
[7979.94s -> 7985.16s]  and the spirits of the champions are free.
[7985.16s -> 7988.36s]  We will all be awaiting your clash with Ganon
[7988.36s -> 7990.40s]  at Hyrule Castle.
[7990.40s -> 7991.52s]  Link, I'm under here.
[7996.65s -> 7997.69s]  Don't ask me how I got in here.
[7997.69s -> 8001.50s]  I was on an adventure and I fell down in here.
[8007.04s -> 8008.92s]  We were doing renovations.
[8008.92s -> 8013.01s]  I got stuck in here.
[8013.01s -> 8014.73s]  In fact, Link, you're standing
[8014.73s -> 8018.04s]  on the only air hole that exists.
[8018.04s -> 8021.14s]  Please move.
[8021.18s -> 8026.45s]  Okay.
[8026.45s -> 8027.37s]  Are we going?
[8027.37s -> 8029.84s]  Is it time to go?
[8029.84s -> 8035.38s]  So now we have to go back here, right?
[8035.38s -> 8036.38s]  That song.
[8036.38s -> 8038.59s]  Do I care about the song?
[8038.59s -> 8040.55s]  Stop being a comedian and just go.
[8040.55s -> 8044.09s]  Eh, yeah, all right, gotcha.
[8044.09s -> 8046.85s]  I have to make, no, now just go.
[8046.85s -> 8049.61s]  No, just go, go, go, go, go.
[8049.61s -> 8051.62s]  Right here?
[8051.62s -> 8054.72s]  You're not even wasting time to be funny.
[8054.72s -> 8057.53s]  Is it?
[8057.53s -> 8058.77s]  No, I see what's going on.
[8058.77s -> 8062.62s]  It's when we, when we added betting to this,
[8062.62s -> 8064.66s]  is when all of you now,
[8065.18s -> 8068.54s]  all of you now do not care about anything else.
[8068.54s -> 8070.62s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, just shut the fuck up and go, man.
[8070.62s -> 8073.70s]  I put every channel point I have on you fucking losing
[8073.70s -> 8075.58s]  or winning, go, I don't care.
[8080.11s -> 8084.73s]  I should have done that first.
[8084.73s -> 8085.65s]  Are you serious?
[8085.65s -> 8087.05s]  This is like the power I should have gotten
[8087.05s -> 8089.50s]  in the very beginning of the game.
[8089.50s -> 8091.06s]  And I'm, and I have it an hour before
[8091.06s -> 8100.97s]  I'm never playing it ever again.
[8100.97s -> 8102.66s]  All right, I did it.
[8102.66s -> 8103.74s]  We did it.
[8103.74s -> 8105.66s]  Very cool, very good.
[8105.66s -> 8110.28s]  Life and the divine beast will ravage the calamity now.
[8110.28s -> 8111.12s]  All right.
[8114.55s -> 8117.03s]  Feel free to take what you find in that chest.
[8117.03s -> 8117.91s]  What are you doing?
[8117.91s -> 8122.41s]  I, there's an item in here.
[8122.41s -> 8124.17s]  That sword you have in your possession.
[8124.17s -> 8126.81s]  Would it be the sword that seals the darkness?
[8126.81s -> 8128.97s]  A Hylian champion who fought alongside
[8128.97s -> 8131.57s]  Master Revali a hundred years ago?
[8131.57s -> 8134.57s]  Would that be you?
[8134.57s -> 8139.19s]  It is.
[8139.19s -> 8142.54s]  All right, I got the great eagle bow.
[8142.54s -> 8145.22s]  I got a ton of bombs.
[8145.22s -> 8146.91s]  I'm ready.
[8146.91s -> 8149.14s]  I've got a full heal.
[8149.14s -> 8152.12s]  What, be honest with me for real.
[8152.12s -> 8153.92s]  What is the best possible way to do it?
[8153.92s -> 8157.63s]  Just teleport to here.
[8157.63s -> 8158.71s]  Fast travel right here.
[8158.71s -> 8159.83s]  Go, I'm just gonna go right in the front door.
[8159.83s -> 8165.98s]  I'm just gonna knock on the front door.
[8165.98s -> 8169.90s]  I need food.
[8169.90s -> 8171.94s]  All right, what kind of food am I looking for?
[8171.94s -> 8172.82s]  Is it fire?
[8172.82s -> 8173.66s]  Is it lightning?
[8173.66s -> 8175.54s]  Is it cold?
[8175.54s -> 8179.79s]  What should I be making?
[8179.79s -> 8181.11s]  Food then go, food then go.
[8181.11s -> 8181.95s]  I got it.
[8181.95s -> 8184.43s]  Just make only health, health, health, health, health, health.
[8184.43s -> 8186.51s]  Just heals.
[8187.23s -> 8194.14s]  Link, Link, Link.
[8194.14s -> 8196.39s]  I have witnessed your journey.
[8196.39s -> 8200.08s]  You have overcome every challenge laid before you.
[8200.08s -> 8205.64s]  Ruta, Rudania, Meadow, Naboris.
[8207.38s -> 8212.24s]  All of the divine beasts are now free.
[8212.24s -> 8214.56s]  With the strength you have attained,
[8214.56s -> 8217.20s]  I am certain you can unlock the powerful force
[8217.20s -> 8220.85s]  hidden within.
[8220.85s -> 8222.57s]  Go to the Shrine of Resurrection.
[8222.57s -> 8223.41s]  The Shrine of Resurrection.
[8223.41s -> 8225.57s]  And return the Sheikah Slate to its terminal.
[8225.61s -> 8228.84s]  Okay, I have to do that.
[8232.15s -> 8234.22s]  Why does that say EX?
[8234.22s -> 8236.69s]  That's DLC?
[8236.69s -> 8237.93s]  All right, no, we're not doing DLC.
[8237.93s -> 8239.21s]  I'm going in the front door.
[8239.21s -> 8241.02s]  I need a town though.
[8241.02s -> 8244.41s]  I need to buy shit at a town.
[8244.41s -> 8250.02s]  Where's there a good place to go and get some stuff?
[8250.02s -> 8252.54s]  There's good food where, okay.
[8252.54s -> 8256.69s]  I'm gonna say Zorro?
[8256.69s -> 8259.18s]  Where can I get good food?
[8259.18s -> 8260.02s]  You don't have time?
[8260.02s -> 8266.81s]  I got time for food.
[8266.81s -> 8268.21s]  There's food in the castle.
[8268.21s -> 8276.04s]  Is there actually like a shop or something?
[8276.04s -> 8277.76s]  You hate this game and want it to be over
[8277.76s -> 8279.12s]  as soon as possible.
[8279.12s -> 8280.74s]  That's not true.
[8281.26s -> 8283.18s]  I felt bad that I got this far without beating it.
[8283.18s -> 8284.50s]  And I wanna beat it.
[8284.50s -> 8286.90s]  And I'm very happy with how the game has been so far,
[8286.90s -> 8287.74s]  but I'm ready.
[8287.74s -> 8291.38s]  Let's go.
[8291.38s -> 8294.02s]  Get your Amiibo.
[8294.02s -> 8295.50s]  How much time is left on the timer?
[8295.50s -> 8299.15s]  There is about an hour.
[8299.15s -> 8315.20s]  There's a vendor in the castle.
[8315.20s -> 8316.36s]  Cooking pots in castle.
[8316.36s -> 8317.56s]  So there's no vendor in the castle then.
[8317.56s -> 8318.44s]  So people align.
[8323.97s -> 8324.81s]  Let me just go to,
[8324.81s -> 8327.23s]  I'm gonna go just to here.
[8327.23s -> 8328.47s]  I know, I know.
[8328.47s -> 8329.51s]  Everyone's like, just go, go, go.
[8329.51s -> 8332.82s]  But I wanna buy some stuff.
[8332.82s -> 8334.26s]  I don't trust there's one in the castle.
[8334.26s -> 8348.46s]  I feel like people align.
[8348.50s -> 8350.30s]  If he goes in without food, he'll just die anyways.
[8350.30s -> 8351.14s]  Yeah.
[8351.14s -> 8353.89s]  I wanna give myself a chance.
[8353.89s -> 8355.61s]  We still, there's still over an hour.
[8355.61s -> 8358.53s]  An hour and five minutes to get to the last hit on Ganon.
[8358.53s -> 8360.77s]  That's not happening, but I'll try.
[8360.77s -> 8363.66s]  I'm gonna speed it up.
[8363.66s -> 8364.50s]  Okay.
[8364.50s -> 8365.90s]  So where, I just need a vendor.
[8365.90s -> 8367.10s]  I just need, okay.
[8369.09s -> 8370.21s]  General store, right there.
[8370.21s -> 8381.74s]  Just straight ahead.
[8381.74s -> 8383.18s]  I don't know what that thing is.
[8383.18s -> 8390.02s]  I didn't wanna shoot.
[8390.02s -> 8392.40s]  Okay.
[8392.40s -> 8394.00s]  Do I have enough to upgrade anything?
[8394.00s -> 8395.48s]  Because I'm gonna do this quick.
[8395.48s -> 8396.44s]  If I have enough to upgrade,
[8396.44s -> 8397.96s]  what's the best gear that I have right now?
[8398.80s -> 8403.38s]  Probably the, I don't know.
[8403.38s -> 8407.41s]  Honestly, probably the thing I had on before.
[8407.41s -> 8417.32s]  Champion's tunic?
[8417.32s -> 8419.36s]  Probably this, all the soldier shit.
[8419.36s -> 8420.82s]  Okay.
[8420.82s -> 8423.06s]  All right, can I do, can I upgrade any of this?
[8430.08s -> 8434.10s]  Champion's tunic's probably the best.
[8434.10s -> 8436.48s]  Okay, what do we got?
[8436.48s -> 8440.64s]  I can upgrade the champion's tunic.
[8440.64s -> 8444.33s]  Should I?
[8444.33s -> 8445.77s]  That sounds like a good idea.
[8450.70s -> 8458.46s]  That'll be better than what I have on now, right?
[8458.46s -> 8462.54s]  Okay.
[8462.54s -> 8470.44s]  Being able to see health is important.
[8473.21s -> 8474.09s]  Upgrade it again.
[8476.47s -> 8477.62s]  Do I have enough?
[8477.62s -> 8485.51s]  If I can do it twice, I'll do it.
[8485.51s -> 8486.51s]  I don't think I can.
[8489.42s -> 8490.62s]  No, I can't do it again.
[8495.78s -> 8496.99s]  Okay.
[8496.99s -> 8499.82s]  We're going to make food.
[8499.82s -> 8501.98s]  I'm putting that on.
[8501.98s -> 8506.74s]  That's 20 defense, and now I can see enemy health.
[8506.74s -> 8507.94s]  20.
[8507.94s -> 8510.62s]  All right, this is, I've got a good set of gear on.
[8510.62s -> 8513.63s]  I'm good to go.
[8513.63s -> 8515.67s]  Right now, I need to go.
[8516.43s -> 8519.43s]  This is shaving a second off.
[8524.39s -> 8525.83s]  Yeah, I can't just go.
[8525.83s -> 8528.27s]  I'm guaranteed to lose if I just go.
[8528.27s -> 8532.97s]  I need to get at least another two or three big heals.
[8532.97s -> 8535.37s]  It's, you guys are saying, holy, you guys,
[8535.37s -> 8537.68s]  like, go, go, go.
[8537.68s -> 8539.60s]  All of you believers need to understand
[8539.60s -> 8543.76s]  that if I get to Ganon and I die, you'll lose anyways.
[8543.76s -> 8546.18s]  And I think I'm going to die more than once.
[8547.26s -> 8548.46s]  We're going to do it.
[8548.46s -> 8549.30s]  I got time.
[8552.02s -> 8553.34s]  There's like apples and shit right here.
[8553.34s -> 8562.77s]  This is good.
[8562.77s -> 8574.60s]  Okay, where's the general store?
[8574.60s -> 8575.60s]  All right.
[8575.60s -> 8577.20s]  Fire arrows.
[8577.20s -> 8578.68s]  At this point, I should just take them all, right?
[8578.68s -> 8586.86s]  Just take everything?
[8586.86s -> 8598.46s]  Might as well just buy every single thing I can.
[8607.79s -> 8611.98s]  Okay, now what about food?
[8611.98s -> 8615.07s]  Like, real food?
[8615.07s -> 8617.11s]  I'm willing to pay a premium, by the way.
[8625.01s -> 8629.32s]  Different store.
[8629.32s -> 8637.90s]  I don't think I have enough ingredients to cook any food.
[8637.90s -> 8640.90s]  I mean, what do I even have?
[8640.90s -> 8643.92s]  I think I just have to cook everything.
[8643.92s -> 8647.09s]  The store with the carrot on it.
[8647.09s -> 8648.55s]  Wait, this one?
[8648.55s -> 8672.17s]  This has a carrot on it.
[8672.17s -> 8677.78s]  Shitload of carrots here.
[8677.78s -> 8678.74s]  Okay, hell yeah.
[8678.74s -> 8679.58s]  All right, all right, all right.
[8679.58s -> 8681.46s]  We're good.
[8681.46s -> 8685.85s]  Now I'm just going to make a bunch of food.
[8685.85s -> 8688.89s]  Bro is hanging out in Publix with 45 minutes left.
[8688.89s -> 8692.05s]  I need to, I have to make this food, you don't understand.
[8692.05s -> 8693.17s]  All right, what's the best,
[8693.17s -> 8694.73s]  what's the best recipe I can do right now?
[8694.73s -> 8701.10s]  Carrot, carrot, carrot, apple, apple, apple, monster guts.
[8701.10s -> 8705.26s]  Carrot, carrot, carrot.
[8705.26s -> 8706.10s]  How many carrots?
[8706.10s -> 8707.86s]  How many carrots should I put in?
[8707.86s -> 8708.70s]  Who cares?
[8708.70s -> 8710.26s]  It doesn't matter.
[8710.26s -> 8712.10s]  It actually doesn't even matter.
[8720.78s -> 8721.62s]  There we go.
[8721.62s -> 8724.14s]  That's 10 health potions.
[8724.14s -> 8725.14s]  It actually doesn't even matter.
[8725.14s -> 8727.99s]  Who cares?
[8727.99s -> 8728.83s]  I need health.
[8728.83s -> 8729.79s]  I need heals.
[8729.79s -> 8732.30s]  Who cares?
[8732.30s -> 8733.34s]  I bought all these carrots
[8733.34s -> 8734.54s]  and I don't even know where the fuck they are.
[8734.54s -> 8735.38s]  Okay, there.
[8744.18s -> 8745.02s]  Okay, good.
[8745.02s -> 8752.74s]  That's movement speed, all right.
[8752.74s -> 8754.13s]  Okay.
[8754.13s -> 8755.69s]  What else can I use here?
[8755.69s -> 8756.93s]  Let's do carrot.
[8756.93s -> 8759.70s]  Carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot.
[8759.74s -> 8762.86s]  Butter.
[8762.86s -> 8765.96s]  Wait, shit.
[8768.89s -> 8771.68s]  Put away a carrot and put an egg in there.
[8771.68s -> 8776.54s]  Egg, carrot, carrot, carrot, butter.
[8776.54s -> 8778.06s]  That's gonna be fucking great.
[8783.55s -> 8784.39s]  Perfect.
[8784.39s -> 8787.68s]  I'm gonna make that a bunch of times in a row.
[8787.68s -> 8791.28s]  That's carrot, carrot, carrot, butter, egg.
[8800.11s -> 8802.39s]  What was wrong with that?
[8802.39s -> 8805.06s]  What was wrong with that one?
[8805.06s -> 8809.93s]  Egg, butter.
[8809.93s -> 8826.67s]  This one's gonna be really fatty.
[8826.67s -> 8827.55s]  Oh yeah, sure.
[8832.82s -> 8833.66s]  10, good.
[8837.01s -> 8840.54s]  I'm just gonna put a bunch of eggs and salt in this one.
[8845.65s -> 8846.49s]  I'm not wasting it.
[8846.49s -> 8847.49s]  I just need the heals.
[8859.91s -> 8866.18s]  What?
[8869.66s -> 8870.50s]  Use it to make...
[8870.50s -> 8871.90s]  Okay, this is good in stews.
[8871.90s -> 8874.45s]  We're gonna do two of these.
[8874.45s -> 8880.82s]  We're gonna do two of these, a little bit of salt.
[8888.55s -> 8890.43s]  Okay, I have a lot of heals now.
[8890.43s -> 8894.67s]  I think I'm good.
[8894.67s -> 8895.83s]  I need salt and shit too.
[8895.83s -> 8899.08s]  Hold on, salt, salt.
[8899.08s -> 8909.08s]  And who cares?
[8909.08s -> 8910.04s]  Well, that was not worth it.
[8910.04s -> 8911.12s]  All right, I'm good.
[8911.12s -> 8912.60s]  Now it's time to go.
[8912.60s -> 8913.48s]  All right, get the horse.
[8913.48s -> 8915.96s]  We're riding straight into Ganon's castle
[8915.96s -> 8919.56s]  and we're gonna take it back.
[8919.56s -> 8922.85s]  You guys ready?
[8922.85s -> 8927.41s]  What's the fastest way to get there?
[8927.41s -> 8939.93s]  Horse right here.
[8939.93s -> 8941.21s]  Just glide from the tower.
[8941.21s -> 8943.01s]  Ooh, actually smart call.
[8943.01s -> 8944.09s]  I got an hour.
[8944.09s -> 8952.66s]  I have one full hour.
[8952.66s -> 8955.70s]  Run past every enemy, dude.
[8955.70s -> 8957.83s]  Should I?
[8957.83s -> 8960.39s]  I got time, I got time, I got time.
[8960.39s -> 8966.90s]  I might not have very much time, but where's the tower?
[8966.90s -> 8967.74s]  All right, fuck it.
[8967.74s -> 8969.70s]  Yeah, fuck the horse.
[8969.70s -> 8970.94s]  The horse helped us a lot,
[8970.94s -> 8987.55s]  but I'm literally gonna slide from the tower.
[8987.55s -> 8989.23s]  It all comes down to this.
[8989.23s -> 8993.16s]  The end of the Breath of the Wild playthrough.
[8993.16s -> 8995.08s]  Over three years in the making.
[8998.22s -> 9003.42s]  How do I get the quest?
[9003.42s -> 9006.00s]  Destroy Ganon.
[9042.29s -> 9044.34s]  That was not far enough.
[9044.34s -> 9047.46s]  It's okay.
[9047.46s -> 9054.17s]  We're actually not that far.
[9054.21s -> 9065.23s]  There's a shrine over here too.
[9065.23s -> 9066.67s]  Oh, this is gonna be close.
[9066.67s -> 9069.51s]  I was not, you know,
[9069.51s -> 9072.72s]  what about let me see if I can do it in three hours.
[9072.72s -> 9077.44s]  I'm kind of amped up right now.
[9077.44s -> 9078.44s]  You got how to surf?
[9079.56s -> 9080.72s]  Yep.
[9080.72s -> 9081.56s]  I did.
[9084.07s -> 9084.91s]  I did.
[9084.91s -> 9085.75s]  You're right.
[9085.75s -> 9101.94s]  I don't know how.
[9101.94s -> 9102.94s]  ZL jump A.
[9107.91s -> 9115.33s]  I don't know.
[9115.33s -> 9122.49s]  We're good.
[9122.49s -> 9124.46s]  We're good.
[9124.46s -> 9125.30s]  Come on.
[9137.67s -> 9139.55s]  Do I have less than a hundred seconds left in Mario?
[9139.55s -> 9140.79s]  Why does it get faster?
[9140.79s -> 9141.63s]  Oh no.
[9157.79s -> 9159.07s]  Can I block?
[9159.07s -> 9160.15s]  Okay.
[9160.15s -> 9164.47s]  I can probably just kill this thing, honestly.
[9164.47s -> 9166.51s]  Why would you face the, okay.
[9166.51s -> 9168.11s]  I'm locking on.
[9168.11s -> 9170.79s]  He's facing the camera.
[9170.79s -> 9173.28s]  Why are you facing the camera?
[9173.28s -> 9176.98s]  Why did he face the camera?
[9176.98s -> 9185.14s]  Wouldn't lock on turn him around?
[9185.14s -> 9195.10s]  There's another enemy off camera.
[9195.10s -> 9197.58s]  And why did it put me all the way back here?
[9202.67s -> 9206.27s]  What just happened?
[9206.27s -> 9207.83s]  You didn't save it?
[9207.83s -> 9208.95s]  Doesn't it put you?
[9208.95s -> 9212.15s]  Wait, did I not even do the cooking shit?
[9212.15s -> 9219.78s]  You gotta be kidding me.
[9219.78s -> 9220.62s]  Why?
[9220.62s -> 9221.98s]  I feel like I've died a million times
[9221.98s -> 9222.82s]  and it just puts me kind of,
[9222.82s -> 9226.59s]  oh, it's back to the last save point.
[9226.59s -> 9229.37s]  Oh, that's annoying.
[9229.37s -> 9230.97s]  Oh my God.
[9230.97s -> 9232.53s]  Well, that's it.
[9232.53s -> 9233.37s]  It's over.
[9233.37s -> 9241.28s]  Sorry, everybody.
[9241.28s -> 9242.68s]  I didn't even upgrade the armor.
[9242.68s -> 9246.18s]  Are you serious?
[9246.18s -> 9247.50s]  Manual saving?
[9247.50s -> 9248.34s]  Really?
[9248.34s -> 9250.10s]  Are we still to do manual saving
[9250.10s -> 9265.06s]  at the last fucking checkpoint in the game?
[9265.10s -> 9266.18s]  Okay.
[9267.26s -> 9268.10s]  That doesn't count.
[9268.10s -> 9269.58s]  I get an extra 10 minutes.
[9269.58s -> 9271.29s]  No, I don't.
[9271.29s -> 9274.56s]  Now I have to do everything I just did all over again.
[9274.56s -> 9276.04s]  Well, honestly, I much prefer
[9276.04s -> 9279.40s]  like the From Software version of gaming
[9279.40s -> 9280.52s]  where if you,
[9280.52s -> 9283.98s]  dude, if you sneeze, the game auto saves.
[9283.98s -> 9285.14s]  Do you know what I mean?
[9287.62s -> 9289.42s]  Give me manual saves, that's fine.
[9289.42s -> 9293.10s]  But if literally, if I fucking hit up on the control stick,
[9293.10s -> 9298.93s]  auto save the game.
[9298.93s -> 9300.37s]  Okay, well, let me,
[9300.37s -> 9305.92s]  did I even buy anything?
[9305.92s -> 9306.76s]  I don't even remember.
[9307.36s -> 9308.68s]  Did I actually?
[9308.68s -> 9309.96s]  Oh, come on, dude.
[9311.46s -> 9319.88s]  Oh my God.
[9319.88s -> 9338.16s]  I actually have to upgrade this again.
[9338.16s -> 9339.56s]  It was an auto save.
[9339.56s -> 9340.40s]  How come?
[9340.40s -> 9343.00s]  Wait, why would it not put me to the auto save?
[9343.00s -> 9345.19s]  Now I'm getting frustrated.
[9345.19s -> 9354.21s]  Where's the auto save?
[9354.21s -> 9356.80s]  What the hell?
[9356.80s -> 9365.28s]  Wait, how long ago is that?
[9365.28s -> 9368.33s]  Was this even further back?
[9368.33s -> 9370.26s]  Because this is on top of the tower.
[9370.26s -> 9372.38s]  No, this is like 25 minutes ago.
[9373.50s -> 9374.70s]  Isn't it?
[9374.70s -> 9375.54s]  Yeah.
[9377.49s -> 9378.33s]  Oh, come on.
[9378.33s -> 9379.17s]  It was three minutes.
[9379.17s -> 9383.27s]  Actually, that sucks so bad
[9383.27s -> 9391.31s]  that I don't have a save within the last like 15 minutes.
[9391.31s -> 9393.37s]  How often does Zelda auto save?
[9393.37s -> 9394.65s]  Is it more than 15 minutes?
[9394.65s -> 9403.93s]  20 minutes?
[9403.93s -> 9410.60s]  Well, I'm just gonna do what I just did again.
[9410.60s -> 9413.61s]  It's probably when you teleport.
[9413.61s -> 9415.25s]  I have to do all this again.
[9430.73s -> 9432.69s]  The game saves every five minutes.
[9432.69s -> 9435.26s]  No, it doesn't.
[9435.26s -> 9437.86s]  I walked around cooked food for 15 minutes straight.
[9445.03s -> 9446.83s]  Just go right to Ganon?
[9446.83s -> 9459.44s]  Suck it up, cry baby.
[9459.44s -> 9460.84s]  Okay.
[9461.92s -> 9463.20s]  Let me go make the food.
[9463.20s -> 9466.31s]  I don't want to get there and lose.
[9466.31s -> 9471.31s]  So sorry that we got screwed by an auto save teacher.
[9472.90s -> 9473.78s]  Sorry, guys.
[9478.12s -> 9480.16s]  That's my fault for not manually saving
[9480.16s -> 9484.82s]  before every single encounter that's important.
[9484.82s -> 9491.47s]  Oh, well.
[9492.27s -> 9493.11s]  You could just try killing Ganon right...
[9493.11s -> 9495.43s]  I guess I could just go try to kill Ganon right now.
[9495.43s -> 9497.43s]  Just run through the dungeon.
[9497.43s -> 9498.67s]  That's possible, right?
[9503.92s -> 9504.76s]  I don't think I...
[9504.76s -> 9505.60s]  No, no.
[9506.88s -> 9511.09s]  I could try it.
[9511.09s -> 9512.33s]  All right, here's the plan.
[9512.33s -> 9513.17s]  Here's the plan.
[9513.17s -> 9514.21s]  His plan is plan.
[9514.21s -> 9522.12s]  I'm going as fast as I can.
[9535.42s -> 9536.34s]  Did I at least buy?
[9536.34s -> 9539.07s]  No, I'm all right, I'm all right.
[9539.07s -> 9540.67s]  I don't think I was ever gonna do it anyways,
[9540.67s -> 9542.51s]  but it was worth a shot.
[9542.51s -> 9543.79s]  I'm still gonna beat it,
[9543.79s -> 9545.55s]  even if I don't do it in the timer.
[9545.55s -> 9546.55s]  I'm still gonna do it.
[9546.55s -> 9549.91s]  The joke of me turning off the game is not gonna happen.
[9549.91s -> 9557.99s]  I will complete it.
[9557.99s -> 9561.47s]  You're just gonna lose a lot of channel points.
[9561.47s -> 9563.59s]  Whoever bet for me to win.
[9572.74s -> 9580.65s]  All right, let's make the food again.
[9580.65s -> 9581.97s]  The recipes.
[9585.22s -> 9587.45s]  Okay.
[9587.45s -> 9588.93s]  Now I gotta remember what the hell I even did.
[9588.93s -> 9589.93s]  It was bat.
[9594.38s -> 9598.36s]  Okay, it was butter, salt, and...
[9598.36s -> 9602.71s]  Butter, salt, eggs, and carrots.
[9602.71s -> 9609.11s]  It's a double carrot.
[9614.74s -> 9617.04s]  Okay.
[9617.72s -> 9624.03s]  Butter, salt, egg, double carrot.
[9624.03s -> 9629.24s]  Where are my carrots?
[9629.24s -> 9630.08s]  Where are...
[9630.08s -> 9632.00s]  Oh my God, these carrots are so weird.
[9632.00s -> 9633.84s]  They blend in with everything.
[9633.84s -> 9644.61s]  No, don't eat one.
[9644.61s -> 9645.45s]  Stop cooking.
[9645.45s -> 9647.30s]  I'll die.
[9647.30s -> 9649.70s]  You think I'm gonna be able to kill Calamity Ganon
[9649.70s -> 9651.06s]  with no heals?
[9651.06s -> 9663.62s]  It's never gonna happen.
[9663.62s -> 9679.74s]  Okay, good.
[9679.74s -> 9682.04s]  Why was that so bad?
[9682.04s -> 9683.96s]  All right, only, I'm gonna do one more.
[9683.96s -> 9689.42s]  I should have enough after this.
[9689.42s -> 9693.16s]  Wait, don't I have something that gives a lot of hearts?
[9693.16s -> 9694.08s]  This one right here.
[9694.08s -> 9706.57s]  I'm gonna just cook that with salt.
[9706.57s -> 9707.97s]  So it's just a bunch of hearts?
[9707.97s -> 9711.38s]  Or should I just do it alone?
[9711.38s -> 9712.46s]  Should I just do it by itself?
[9712.46s -> 9714.06s]  It temporarily increases your maximum hearts
[9714.06s -> 9714.90s]  when cooked into a dish.
[9714.90s -> 9716.63s]  Or should I add stuff to it?
[9716.63s -> 9724.10s]  Add a melon, just salt.
[9724.10s -> 9725.55s]  Cook it alone?
[9725.55s -> 9727.03s]  Just cook alone, by itself?
[9727.03s -> 9732.98s]  Okay.
[9732.98s -> 9733.82s]  Holy shit.
[9733.82s -> 9735.18s]  Okay.
[9735.18s -> 9736.34s]  I still have time.
[9736.34s -> 9737.18s]  There's still time.
[9737.18s -> 9738.02s]  I got time, I got time, everybody.
[9738.02s -> 9739.02s]  That was awesome.
[9739.02s -> 9740.83s]  Holy shit.
[9740.83s -> 9742.87s]  I got time, I got time, I got time, I got time.
[9742.87s -> 9743.99s]  Go to the waterfall?
[9745.27s -> 9747.75s]  Put on your Zora armor and swim up to the final battle?
[9747.75s -> 9752.74s]  Wait, is that real?
[9752.74s -> 9762.06s]  Are you giving me like the speed run strategy?
[9762.06s -> 9762.90s]  All right.
[9762.90s -> 9763.74s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[9763.74s -> 9766.68s]  I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.
[9766.68s -> 9771.18s]  Any more goat butter or whatever it is?
[9771.18s -> 9782.44s]  I don't know what any of this shit does, who cares?
[9782.44s -> 9783.40s]  We're back, we're back.
[9783.40s -> 9784.60s]  Yeah, we're back, we're actually back.
[9784.60s -> 9785.44s]  All right.
[9785.44s -> 9791.84s]  Now, where's this?
[9791.84s -> 9794.44s]  Go to the waterfall in the southwest of the island
[9794.44s -> 9799.84s]  that Hyrule Castle is on.
[9799.84s -> 9805.10s]  Go to the waterfall in the southwest island.
[9805.10s -> 9808.51s]  This is cheating.
[9808.51s -> 9814.14s]  I saved it.
[9814.14s -> 9818.02s]  He is never gonna find that.
[9818.02s -> 9821.39s]  What, we got 35 minutes?
[9822.27s -> 9824.93s]  Please give us the underdog moment we've been waiting for.
[9824.93s -> 9826.43s]  Okay.
[9826.43s -> 9828.59s]  Waterfall in the southwest of the island
[9828.59s -> 9829.75s]  that Hyrule Castle is on.
[9829.75s -> 9831.75s]  Put on your Zora armor and swim up the waterfall.
[9831.75s -> 9833.67s]  Keep going up each waterfall that you reach.
[9833.67s -> 9835.39s]  It should be very close.
[9835.39s -> 9841.11s]  Pass a few guardians, okay?
[9841.11s -> 9847.25s]  So from here, from Hyrule Castle, southwest of the island.
[9848.05s -> 9851.66s]  So down here somewhere, like over here?
[9851.66s -> 9865.18s]  I'm gonna say like right here somewhere.
[9865.18s -> 9867.50s]  Should I get the horse, honestly?
[9867.50s -> 9870.90s]  The island the castle is on.
[9871.02s -> 9874.02s]  So you mean like here somewhere.
[9874.02s -> 9879.50s]  I gotta even get there first.
[9879.50s -> 9880.94s]  What's the safe way to even get over here?
[9880.94s -> 9882.94s]  I feel like there's a ton of those laser shooting guardians
[9882.94s -> 9885.70s]  that just fire machine guns at you.
[9887.48s -> 9888.68s]  My armor is different.
[9888.68s -> 9892.01s]  Right.
[9892.01s -> 9892.85s]  Zora armor.
[9896.24s -> 9901.75s]  That's it, all right.
[9901.75s -> 9902.59s]  Save it here.
[9902.59s -> 9904.78s]  I just saved it a second ago.
[9904.78s -> 9906.22s]  Go to the central tower.
[9912.30s -> 9913.70s]  I don't know what hell I'm going.
[9913.70s -> 9916.54s]  I guess I've never, I've never even seen this before.
[9916.54s -> 9920.77s]  I don't know where to go.
[9920.77s -> 9921.85s]  I guess, I mean, I'm,
[9922.37s -> 9923.41s]  I think I can get there from here.
[9923.41s -> 9924.97s]  There's no bullshit in the way.
[9930.22s -> 9932.06s]  I just gotta remember how you do the,
[9936.12s -> 9942.20s]  it's right here.
[9942.20s -> 9944.40s]  ZL jump and then A.
[9955.82s -> 9957.62s]  This thing's gonna fucking shatter.
[9964.23s -> 9978.77s]  All right, Tilda, I'm coming to save you.
[9978.77s -> 9985.50s]  How bad, how bad is this current?
[9985.50s -> 9991.18s]  Fuck.
[9991.18s -> 9994.78s]  What the fuck is that thing?
[9994.78s -> 10000.99s]  Yeah.
[10000.99s -> 10002.11s]  Okay, all right.
[10002.11s -> 10003.19s]  We're getting there, we're getting there.
[10003.19s -> 10004.75s]  Don't aggro that thing.
[10007.35s -> 10015.15s]  Oops.
[10015.15s -> 10016.35s]  Bro, I'm gonna start screaming.
[10016.35s -> 10019.39s]  Everybody fucking settle down, okay?
[10019.39s -> 10020.31s]  Settle down.
[10020.31s -> 10021.95s]  Everything is gonna be just fine.
[10028.07s -> 10035.52s]  Can't get in here.
[10035.52s -> 10037.00s]  I can't swim again.
[10037.00s -> 10056.66s]  Don't I have the swimming outfit on?
[10056.66s -> 10063.95s]  We're good.
[10063.95s -> 10070.02s]  Hey, if I could get this thing away from me, seriously.
[10070.02s -> 10071.18s]  You know what?
[10071.18s -> 10072.66s]  Just fucking die.
[10080.91s -> 10081.83s]  How do you parry?
[10088.54s -> 10089.38s]  How do you parry?
[10089.38s -> 10091.20s]  What is parry?
[10092.16s -> 10094.33s]  It's A.
[10094.33s -> 10101.68s]  I would run by, but the thing just,
[10101.68s -> 10108.28s]  it's shield plus A.
[10108.28s -> 10111.78s]  Okay, well, I'm just gonna try to run away
[10111.78s -> 10113.98s]  from the lock-on enemy that locks on you
[10113.98s -> 10116.38s]  from across the entire video game.
[10116.38s -> 10118.34s]  Whoa!
[10118.34s -> 10119.34s]  Hold on.
[10119.34s -> 10120.94s]  Don't get angry at the enemy that you hate
[10120.94s -> 10123.50s]  more than anything in any video game you've ever played.
[10125.30s -> 10126.14s]  How does that sound?
[10126.14s -> 10128.09s]  You fucking idiot.
[10128.09s -> 10141.03s]  Nice shot, stupid.
[10141.03s -> 10154.37s]  No, no, great, great enemy.
[10154.37s -> 10155.53s]  I'm gonna get in there again
[10156.21s -> 10157.25s]  and I'm gonna kill you.
[10170.35s -> 10173.80s]  What happened?
[10173.80s -> 10181.60s]  Did I do it?
[10181.60s -> 10184.01s]  Skip the cutscene?
[10184.01s -> 10193.17s]  I can't skip the cutscene.
[10193.17s -> 10214.97s]  I wanna see what Ganon looks like.
[10214.97s -> 10218.83s]  Oh my God.
[10218.83s -> 10220.55s]  This is a whole fortress, guys.
[10222.11s -> 10223.15s]  What is aiming at me?
[10229.22s -> 10231.57s]  Okay, waterfall.
[10231.57s -> 10232.57s]  I gotta go this way.
[10257.56s -> 10259.32s]  Okay.
[10259.32s -> 10260.92s]  I wanna see the, no, I wanna see the map.
[10260.92s -> 10263.08s]  The other map.
[10263.08s -> 10264.97s]  How do I see the other map?
[10265.01s -> 10265.85s]  You missed it?
[10265.85s -> 10267.09s]  Wait, is it this one right here?
[10267.09s -> 10270.02s]  Right there?
[10270.02s -> 10272.74s]  That's the waterfall right there?
[10272.74s -> 10277.54s]  That's it?
[10277.54s -> 10278.78s]  No, not that one.
[10278.78s -> 10280.10s]  Oh, fuck.
[10280.10s -> 10284.59s]  Mods, help!
[10284.59s -> 10285.43s]  I don't know.
[10285.43s -> 10286.27s]  I don't know.
[10286.27s -> 10299.07s]  I'm gonna try that one.
[10299.07s -> 10301.01s]  That's not even a,
[10301.01s -> 10307.49s]  that's not a real waterfall.
[10307.49s -> 10309.13s]  You can't swim up that one.
[10309.13s -> 10315.84s]  Shit.
[10315.84s -> 10317.32s]  The bridge into the castle is south,
[10317.32s -> 10319.04s]  but I'm gonna try this water strategy.
[10319.04s -> 10322.49s]  I kinda like that.
[10322.49s -> 10324.53s]  Dude, that was a mist, not a waterfall.
[10324.53s -> 10325.37s]  Shit.
[10325.37s -> 10326.65s]  What's the?
[10326.65s -> 10333.87s]  Okay, so if I go this way,
[10334.67s -> 10338.65s]  there's a waterfall out here somewhere.
[10338.65s -> 10341.47s]  So like down to the left here, you mean.
[10341.47s -> 10342.51s]  Let me take a look.
[10342.51s -> 10345.07s]  There's a lot of bullshit over here.
[10345.07s -> 10364.58s]  I'm looking for a waterfall.
[10364.58s -> 10365.54s]  God damn it.
[10365.54s -> 10366.54s]  I don't, I don't know where,
[10366.54s -> 10367.78s]  I don't know where it is.
[10369.34s -> 10370.54s]  Oh my goodness.
[10370.54s -> 10371.42s]  That's a lot of shit.
[10371.42s -> 10372.26s]  A, right?
[10372.26s -> 10373.91s]  A?
[10374.75s -> 10375.59s]  Okay, got it, got it, got it.
[10375.59s -> 10376.83s]  I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it.
[10376.83s -> 10378.69s]  I got it.
[10378.69s -> 10379.89s]  Where?
[10379.89s -> 10384.63s]  What happened?
[10384.63s -> 10386.07s]  Okay, let me eat something.
[10386.07s -> 10392.51s]  I don't wanna eat everything now already.
[10395.54s -> 10397.90s]  This is it right here.
[10397.90s -> 10400.26s]  Give me up this waterfall so I can win this.
[10400.26s -> 10411.96s]  I was a stupid challenge.
[10411.96s -> 10412.80s]  Come on.
[10415.58s -> 10416.90s]  All right, now what?
[10416.90s -> 10418.10s]  Now what do I do?
[10418.10s -> 10418.94s]  What was the?
[10418.94s -> 10420.30s]  Where's my instructions?
[10420.30s -> 10425.53s]  Where's my instructions?
[10425.53s -> 10428.20s]  Just go on this one?
[10428.20s -> 10429.48s]  More waterfalls, all the waterfalls.
[10429.48s -> 10430.32s]  Do all waterfalls now.
[10430.32s -> 10431.52s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[10431.52s -> 10432.40s]  Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.
[10432.40s -> 10435.30s]  Let's go.
[10435.30s -> 10439.84s]  Full stamina.
[10439.84s -> 10441.20s]  That was very ugly.
[10441.20s -> 10447.87s]  That was ugly.
[10447.87s -> 10457.54s]  Waterfall three.
[10457.54s -> 10458.38s]  What's that?
[10458.38s -> 10461.38s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[10461.38s -> 10469.50s]  What do I do?
[10469.50s -> 10472.58s]  Just run in?
[10472.58s -> 10474.50s]  Just run, run in, run inside.
[10475.82s -> 10477.66s]  Oh my God, this really is right here.
[10481.86s -> 10492.28s]  No, no.
[10492.28s -> 10493.44s]  I'm right there, dude.
[10493.44s -> 10494.60s]  It's still possible.
[10494.60s -> 10497.98s]  We got, I got 20 minutes to beat this.
[10497.98s -> 10499.98s]  I didn't believe and neither did anybody else,
[10499.98s -> 10505.07s]  but I think I do believe now.
[10505.07s -> 10506.23s]  Where did this put me?
[10507.15s -> 10514.14s]  What did you just do?
[10514.14s -> 10517.94s]  Excuse me, what just happened?
[10517.94s -> 10520.46s]  What's going on here?
[10520.46s -> 10522.02s]  Waterfall again?
[10522.02s -> 10523.66s]  What's going on?
[10523.66s -> 10525.42s]  I don't remember this.
[10525.42s -> 10530.61s]  This is not where I just was.
[10530.61s -> 10531.73s]  Oh, yep, I remember.
[10531.73s -> 10541.58s]  Okay, I got it.
[10541.58s -> 10544.14s]  Okay, come on, here we go.
[10544.14s -> 10546.14s]  That's this, I got an idea.
[10546.14s -> 10552.39s]  I haven't been spotted yet.
[10552.39s -> 10555.16s]  That's fine, that's fine, fuck you.
[10555.16s -> 10556.24s]  Give a shit.
[10556.24s -> 10566.66s]  You can't give a shit.
[10566.66s -> 10570.66s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[10570.66s -> 10572.98s]  You can't be fucking serious.
[10607.24s -> 10608.72s]  Sad boy, suck it up.
[10608.72s -> 10612.06s]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I'm fine.
[10612.06s -> 10613.42s]  You know what?
[10613.42s -> 10615.30s]  I'm just gonna be a weirdo.
[10628.68s -> 10632.55s]  Wrong, I just pressed every single button on my controller.
[10632.55s -> 10633.71s]  All right, come on, Ganon, let's go.
[10633.71s -> 10636.13s]  What, I got 10 minutes?
[10636.13s -> 10643.22s]  Save it right here.
[10643.22s -> 10644.38s]  The Sanctum.
[10644.38s -> 10646.93s]  Did I actually just make it?
[10646.93s -> 10647.93s]  Oh, I'm killing him right now.
[10647.93s -> 10656.09s]  Let's go, I got 17 minutes to beat the game.
[10656.09s -> 10657.09s]  All right, I got bomb arrows.
[10657.09s -> 10658.21s]  It's a shitload of bomb arrows.
[10658.21s -> 10659.05s]  It's a bunch of heals.
[10660.01s -> 10666.08s]  Power-ups.
[10670.14s -> 10671.18s]  I have to change my armor too.
[10671.18s -> 10672.02s]  That's a good idea.
[10672.02s -> 10672.86s]  Good call.
[10679.47s -> 10682.95s]  Whoa, whoa, ow, loud.
[10682.95s -> 10683.79s]  Where did that come from?
[10683.79s -> 10690.29s]  This got so fucking loud.
[10690.29s -> 10692.09s]  That was loud as hell.
[10692.09s -> 10698.02s]  Jesus.
[10698.02s -> 10699.94s]  Dude, it's been this loud?
[10699.94s -> 10707.59s]  Has it really?
[10707.59s -> 10710.06s]  What?
[10710.06s -> 10711.50s]  I didn't realize it was that loud.
[10711.50s -> 10716.47s]  I turned it down.
[10716.47s -> 10718.63s]  It's been fine.
[10718.63s -> 10724.41s]  All right, here we go.
[10724.45s -> 10732.82s]  All right, so there's a giant spider.
[10732.82s -> 10735.72s]  Okay, there you are.
[10735.72s -> 10739.06s]  All right, bomb arrows right in the face.
[10739.06s -> 10746.59s]  Calamity Ganon, I'm ready.
[10746.59s -> 10747.71s]  Here we go, bomb arrows.
[10747.71s -> 10754.94s]  Gonna shoot 100 bomb arrows in his face at the same time.
[10754.94s -> 10756.14s]  No, it's my moment.
[10760.31s -> 10762.71s]  Each one of these is gonna take his health down by 25%.
[10762.71s -> 10775.02s]  If that's really what happens, I hope so.
[10775.02s -> 10780.15s]  Do it, get him.
[10780.15s -> 10781.51s]  Yes, one more.
[10791.58s -> 10792.98s]  All right, let's do it.
[10792.98s -> 10794.86s]  I'm just gonna shoot every bomb arrow I have.
[10794.86s -> 10797.34s]  I don't even wanna see what he has for moves.
[10797.34s -> 10811.57s]  I don't even care.
[10811.57s -> 10813.65s]  It actually is doing that.
[10813.65s -> 10815.72s]  Wow.
[10815.72s -> 10821.86s]  That's a pretty good, okay, it's 50%.
[10821.86s -> 10827.68s]  That was a great cleric beast.
[10827.68s -> 10830.12s]  How many bomb arrows do I have, like 40?
[10830.12s -> 10837.96s]  Okay, let's do it.
[10837.96s -> 10845.54s]  Save the game?
[10845.54s -> 10849.37s]  Can't.
[10849.37s -> 10853.08s]  Okay, I'm already dead.
[10853.08s -> 10856.15s]  Shoot.
[10856.15s -> 10857.55s]  Oh my God.
[10857.55s -> 10859.27s]  Okay, what do I have?
[10859.27s -> 10867.03s]  I have Heal somewhere.
[10867.03s -> 10869.39s]  Okay, I need this other armor on.
[10869.39s -> 10871.87s]  Where is it, right here?
[10871.87s -> 10877.18s]  Okay, and I also want these,
[10877.22s -> 10879.02s]  and that's fine, let's go.
[10881.23s -> 10883.53s]  What does that sound, Ganon?
[10883.53s -> 10886.48s]  I've got something for you.
[10886.48s -> 10915.89s]  And it's 24 bomb arrows right into your head.
[10915.89s -> 10917.79s]  How do you put on a new bow?
[10917.79s -> 10919.43s]  How do I put a new bow on?
[10928.77s -> 10930.73s]  What is, I don't wanna, what the fuck was that?
[10930.73s -> 10932.53s]  I'm doing, I'm holding right on the D-pad
[10932.53s -> 10934.06s]  and it was holding up.
[10934.06s -> 10947.96s]  This pro controller is a fucking piece of crap.
[10947.96s -> 10950.12s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[10950.12s -> 10952.39s]  What is happening?
[10952.39s -> 10962.89s]  Hold, this controller is actually fucking broken.
[10962.89s -> 10965.45s]  I forgot, Breath of the Wild has 80 inputs.
[10965.45s -> 10967.17s]  I forgot it has 800 inputs.
[10975.70s -> 10976.66s]  Hairs in my face.
[11010.36s -> 11030.86s]  I'm just gonna eat everything I have.
[11030.86s -> 11035.85s]  Now what?
[11035.85s -> 11042.18s]  Oh God.
[11042.18s -> 11043.10s]  All right, I can't hurt them,
[11043.10s -> 11044.90s]  I can't hurt them with that anymore.
[11044.90s -> 11047.98s]  Why do I not have a shield on?
[11047.98s -> 11049.06s]  What's the best shield in the whole game?
[11049.06s -> 11050.30s]  What's the best shield in the game?
[11050.30s -> 11059.70s]  This right here.
[11059.70s -> 11061.46s]  Why am I, why is the shield not,
[11061.46s -> 11063.42s]  guys, why is the shield not out?
[11064.83s -> 11072.78s]  What is happening in this game?
[11072.78s -> 11100.57s]  Go, go in.
[11100.57s -> 11101.41s]  Can I hurt that?
[11101.41s -> 11105.75s]  No.
[11105.75s -> 11110.55s]  Dude, I can't even, why am I crouching?
[11112.01s -> 11125.43s]  This game, I swear to God.
[11125.43s -> 11127.07s]  How do I, how do you stop crouching?
[11127.07s -> 11129.91s]  What is, why is there a crouch in the game?
[11129.91s -> 11144.14s]  I don't think, I've never pressed the crouch button.
[11144.14s -> 11151.92s]  How do I, how do I stop him from, how do I get him down?
[11151.92s -> 11161.50s]  Oh shit, I can't hurt him.
[11161.50s -> 11162.34s]  Okay, parry.
[11164.26s -> 11166.62s]  That didn't parry, what?
[11166.62s -> 11167.46s]  Why?
[11167.74s -> 11185.82s]  That looked perfect.
[11185.82s -> 11191.33s]  I don't know how to hurt him now.
[11191.33s -> 11198.75s]  I don't know how to hurt him.
[11198.75s -> 11201.87s]  He's made out of, like, he's made out of solidified shit.
[11201.87s -> 11210.18s]  I can't hurt him.
[11210.18s -> 11213.48s]  You have to parry.
[11213.48s -> 11214.72s]  Oh, I'm skipping this cutscene.
[11214.72s -> 11217.34s]  I got it.
[11217.34s -> 11232.35s]  I got it, I got it, I got time, I got time.
[11232.35s -> 11234.58s]  We got it.
[11234.58s -> 11237.71s]  Use that blue shield, it'll auto parry for you.
[11237.71s -> 11240.41s]  That's good to know.
[11240.41s -> 11241.65s]  I have all the bombs back,
[11241.65s -> 11250.36s]  but I have to put all my gear back on, don't I?
[11250.36s -> 11253.50s]  This will parry automatically, you mean?
[11253.50s -> 11255.41s]  I don't believe it.
[11255.41s -> 11257.33s]  Okay, hold on, let me get all my shit on here.
[11257.33s -> 11260.94s]  That and my bomb arrows.
[11272.07s -> 11273.42s]  Got it.
[11273.42s -> 11274.26s]  I don't even know if I got it.
[11274.26s -> 11275.10s]  What, did I?
[11275.10s -> 11286.06s]  It's hard to tell.
[11286.06s -> 11289.49s]  Is that still early?
[11289.49s -> 11303.50s]  I don't know how you fucking parry in this game.
[11303.50s -> 11316.16s]  All right, do it again.
[11316.16s -> 11341.46s]  Oh, let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[11341.46s -> 11342.83s]  Did I not get it?
[11342.83s -> 11353.02s]  Oh my God, my shield is broken.
[11353.02s -> 11373.45s]  Dude, you're breaking all, why is, ugh!
[11373.45s -> 11379.54s]  The parry, I feel like I don't, I don't get it.
[11379.54s -> 11381.58s]  You know what sucks too, is when you have the bow out,
[11381.58s -> 11386.65s]  and I got it right here, buddy.
[11386.65s -> 11391.75s]  Is that not hitting?
[11392.93s -> 11406.64s]  Yeah, shut up, game.
[11406.64s -> 11408.74s]  Do it again.
[11408.74s -> 11410.28s]  Come on, Gwen.
[11410.28s -> 11424.08s]  Come on, Gwen.
[11424.08s -> 11444.07s]  Oh, those don't, you can't parry those.
[11444.07s -> 11449.94s]  All right, come on, do it.
[11449.94s -> 11460.60s]  Fuck!
[11460.60s -> 11465.86s]  I did it, but it didn't reflect all the way.
[11465.86s -> 11472.43s]  My God, it's so hard, why?
[11472.43s -> 11474.19s]  I don't have a shield on?
[11474.19s -> 11483.70s]  Why is this game like this?
[11483.70s -> 11491.02s]  Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[11491.02s -> 11492.66s]  All right, do I not have armor on?
[11492.66s -> 11503.74s]  It's too late, I can get it right here.
[11503.74s -> 11505.14s]  I still got hit by it, shit.
[11505.14s -> 11508.46s]  It's gonna come down to literally seconds on the clock.
[11508.46s -> 11514.20s]  Shoot him, I can't, he's invincible.
[11514.20s -> 11515.96s]  Where is my character?
[11515.96s -> 11518.57s]  Why is the shield not out?
[11518.57s -> 11535.46s]  I don't get this game, half the time.
[11535.46s -> 11542.41s]  Oh my God.
[11542.41s -> 11547.39s]  All right, shoot me, shoot me, go!
[11547.39s -> 11557.62s]  Fuck you, motherfucker!
[11557.62s -> 11566.66s]  No!
[11566.66s -> 11572.45s]  Come here!
[11572.45s -> 11573.29s]  No!
[11574.73s -> 11576.13s]  Do it again, quick!
[11576.13s -> 11583.34s]  Do it again, do it again, do it again!
[11583.34s -> 11584.18s]  No!
[11586.25s -> 11589.99s]  Yeah!
[11589.99s -> 11597.54s]  I did it!
[11597.54s -> 11603.01s]  With 30, with like 25 seconds to go.
[11603.01s -> 11619.67s]  Yes!
[11619.67s -> 11620.79s]  The answer is no.
[11631.91s -> 11634.75s]  Oh, there's a phase two, of course there is.
[11634.75s -> 11637.43s]  Shit, oh, that was so cool.
[11637.43s -> 11642.85s]  Can we just pretend that it was that?
[11642.85s -> 11644.29s]  Oh, I feel bad.
[11654.61s -> 11657.71s]  It was literally the save, fuck up.
[11657.75s -> 11663.29s]  Well, why is, you can't just save more frequently, hey?
[11663.29s -> 11669.42s]  Why do I have to make 10 fucking family dinners
[11669.42s -> 11679.07s]  and not get an auto-save?
[11679.07s -> 11682.54s]  You sit there, I sit there and cook for 15 straight minutes
[11682.54s -> 11696.59s]  and I don't get an auto-save?
[11696.59s -> 11698.91s]  10 restaurant style meals, that's right.
[11704.39s -> 11712.70s]  Uh-oh, okay.
[11712.70s -> 11714.26s]  This is probably gonna be hard.
[11725.98s -> 11727.94s]  There's Frank!
[11727.94s -> 11730.30s]  Frank, you've been there the whole time.
[11730.30s -> 11743.43s]  Come on, Frank, let's do it.
[11743.43s -> 11745.03s]  Is this like a dodge ball scenario,
[11745.03s -> 11750.10s]  like whoever gets to it first?
[11750.10s -> 11752.88s]  The bow of light.
[11752.88s -> 11755.04s]  Okay.
[11755.04s -> 11769.98s]  Oh, this is, all right, let's go.
[11769.98s -> 11785.41s]  Oh, come over here, come here, I need to get on.
[11785.41s -> 11814.68s]  Do I have infinite arrows?
[11814.68s -> 11815.92s]  All right, I have to shoot them.
[11815.92s -> 11819.63s]  In like, where?
[11819.63s -> 11821.79s]  Oh my God!
[11821.79s -> 11839.16s]  It's because A is not where I want it to be.
[11839.16s -> 11854.66s]  What the hell?
[11854.66s -> 11861.82s]  On the other side, I'm imagining, right?
[11861.82s -> 11863.54s]  Or no, shoot them?
[11877.06s -> 11884.18s]  Oh, I have to wait.
[11884.18s -> 11905.17s]  Too far away?
[11905.17s -> 11913.90s]  Stuck in a tree.
[11913.90s -> 11914.94s]  Okay.
[11914.94s -> 11915.94s]  Thanks everybody for watching
[11915.94s -> 11917.62s]  The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.
[11917.62s -> 11919.34s]  The second that the boss's health goes to zero,
[11919.34s -> 11927.70s]  I'm uninstalling the game.
[11927.70s -> 11928.62s]  No, turn!
[11930.82s -> 11932.50s]  Frank, I, you know what, Frank?
[11932.50s -> 11941.64s]  I don't, remember B is A and A is B.
[11941.64s -> 11946.18s]  It's underneath him.
[11947.02s -> 11947.86s]  Get over here, come on, come on.
[11947.86s -> 11948.78s]  Over here, over here, quick.
[11948.78s -> 11957.66s]  I need you over here right now, please.
[11957.66s -> 11958.50s]  Look up there.
[11962.25s -> 11965.61s]  What am I looking at?
[11965.61s -> 11966.77s]  Oh, wow.
[11966.77s -> 11967.61s]  On his head.
[11988.79s -> 12006.57s]  I did it.
[12006.57s -> 12010.60s]  Hey, I beat the actual boss before the timer went out.
[12010.60s -> 12011.44s]  This is the,
[12011.44s -> 12021.02s]  would you consider this an extended cut scene?
[12021.02s -> 12023.22s]  I guess I technically did have to play it
[12023.22s -> 12051.21s]  and I did almost lose, so, true.
[12051.21s -> 12052.77s]  So how does this game leave Ganon?
[12052.77s -> 12054.33s]  That's what I'm curious about.
[12074.03s -> 12088.81s]  Damn.
[12088.81s -> 12092.42s]  Got him in a Ghostbuster trap, that's good.
[12092.42s -> 12097.38s]  Put him into the, put him into the generator.
[12097.38s -> 12114.49s]  We got him, all right.
[12118.22s -> 12120.06s]  Congrats from five years ago.
[12121.26s -> 12122.10s]  That's true.
[12125.07s -> 12125.91s]  Well, no.
[12127.51s -> 12128.39s]  A year and a half?
[12139.19s -> 12140.51s]  Time for Punch-Out?
[12140.51s -> 12147.40s]  Yeah, we'll move to Punch-Out.
[12150.56s -> 12166.26s]  How can you remember me?
[12166.26s -> 12173.96s]  Dun-dun-dun-dun.
[12173.96s -> 12187.94s]  The Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild.
[12187.94s -> 12200.82s]  Presented by Nintendo.
[12200.82s -> 12206.18s]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[12206.18s -> 12207.02s]  All right, I did it.
[12207.02s -> 12208.02s]  I beat Breath of the Wild.
[12208.02s -> 12220.38s]  I told you I would do it before the year was over.
[12220.38s -> 12223.06s]  My three hour estimate was very close, it was.
[12223.06s -> 12225.90s]  It just, it was a little bit of some fumbling
[12225.90s -> 12233.30s]  with the save system.
[12233.30s -> 12236.80s]  Is there an after credit scene or anything?
[12236.80s -> 12241.70s]  You had so much fun, didn't you?
[12241.70s -> 12243.78s]  Yeah, you had so much, I think, is that,
[12244.30s -> 12245.14s]  or I think the person's making a,
[12245.14s -> 12246.70s]  like a you didn't have fun joke.
[12255.08s -> 12258.14s]  It was all in just, no capitals, just,
[12258.14s -> 12262.70s]  yeah, you had so much fun.
[12262.70s -> 12263.78s]  I did.
[12263.78s -> 12264.62s]  I had fun.
[12264.62s -> 12272.34s]  I had fun playing Breath of the Wild.
[12272.34s -> 12274.49s]  It was fun.
[12274.49s -> 12277.15s]  I had fun.
[12277.15s -> 12279.79s]  I will not be playing Tears of the Kingdom.
[12279.79s -> 12281.61s]  It's not gonna happen.
[12281.61s -> 12282.85s]  It's not gonna play.
[12286.99s -> 12293.48s]  Just something that's not in the immediate cards right now.
[12293.48s -> 12296.27s]  And I'm just kidding, I have it installed right now.
[12296.27s -> 12301.62s]  And we're moving to it immediately.
[12301.62s -> 12305.84s]  That was also a lie.
[12305.84s -> 12306.68s]  I don't know where the truth is
[12306.68s -> 12309.32s]  in that last two sentences.
[12309.32s -> 12310.16s]  No, it was fun.
[12310.16s -> 12311.00s]  I wanted to play it.
[12311.00s -> 12312.62s]  I wanted to beat it.
[12312.62s -> 12314.78s]  Gave me an opportunity to actually see this game
[12314.78s -> 12317.46s]  for what it was, which was a great open world experience.
[12317.46s -> 12319.06s]  Tons of fun stuff to do.
[12319.06s -> 12323.63s]  Divine Beasts.
[12323.63s -> 12326.71s]  I have some complaints about the control scheme.
[12326.71s -> 12327.99s]  That's it.
[12327.99s -> 12333.50s]  I also have a few complaints about the,
[12333.50s -> 12337.22s]  this isn't, no, not add, what?
[12338.18s -> 12340.10s]  Somebody just wrote, laughing my ass off.
[12340.10s -> 12347.26s]  Like, oh, here it comes.
[12347.26s -> 12348.14s]  No, it was great.
[12348.14s -> 12348.98s]  I liked it.
[12348.98s -> 12351.34s]  I liked it a lot.
[12351.34s -> 12352.18s]  I'll give you something.
[12352.18s -> 12354.80s]  This is the first Zelda game I have completed
[12354.80s -> 12359.55s]  since Ocarina of Time.
[12359.55s -> 12361.95s]  This is the first Zelda game I have played truly,
[12361.95s -> 12364.66s]  actually since Ocarina of Time.
[12364.66s -> 12366.50s]  I don't really play Zelda games.
[12366.50s -> 12369.38s]  I'm not really into the franchise at all,
[12369.38s -> 12372.03s]  but this was really good.
[12372.03s -> 12375.56s]  I liked it a lot.
[12375.56s -> 12385.16s]  Is there an after credit scene?
[12385.16s -> 12386.08s]  Play Twilight Princess.
[12386.08s -> 12387.36s]  I can't play Twilight Princess
[12387.36s -> 12392.53s]  because it's chlorine eyes simulator.
[12392.53s -> 12394.53s]  Everything, every light I look at just has,
[12394.53s -> 12396.01s]  it's like I was swimming in a chlorine pool
[12396.01s -> 12413.58s]  for like an hour.
[12413.58s -> 12414.50s]  All right, cool.
[12414.50s -> 12419.67s]  Well, there's Breath of the Wild.
[12419.67s -> 12423.71s]  Should I press a button or anything?
[12423.71s -> 12425.67s]  I have heard Wind Waker is amazing.
[12425.67s -> 12427.43s]  Everybody recommends that game.
[12427.43s -> 12434.14s]  Maybe I'll play it.
[12434.14s -> 12434.98s]  I'm glad you beat it.
[12434.98s -> 12436.90s]  Me too.
[12436.90s -> 12441.57s]  Hey, I'll tell you though, these streams,
[12441.57s -> 12444.59s]  I think were some of the funnest streams.
[12444.59s -> 12445.87s]  I feel like there was a lot of fun times
[12445.87s -> 12450.86s]  on the Breath of the Wild streams.
[12450.86s -> 12451.82s]  Stressful a lot of times.
[12451.82s -> 12455.96s]  Yeah, but it was fun.
[12455.96s -> 12457.72s]  It's one of those games that just has a giant open world
[12457.72s -> 12459.16s]  with a bunch of funny stuff that can happen.
[12459.16s -> 12460.00s]  I love those games.
[12460.00s -> 12467.61s]  So I guess you could say I really liked it.
[12467.61s -> 12469.05s]  All right, now let me try to do the punch out thing.
[12469.05s -> 12481.20s]  See if I can do it.
[12481.20s -> 12484.29s]  Tears of the Kingdom is better in that aspect.
[12484.29s -> 12487.02s]  You know, it's funny because people have told me,
[12487.02s -> 12489.14s]  hey, I know you like Breath of the Wild,
[12489.14s -> 12491.54s]  but you'd like to see some things different in it.
[12491.54s -> 12494.11s]  That's Tears of the Kingdom.
[12494.11s -> 12496.51s]  So like is Tears of the Kingdom the Breath of the Wild
[12496.51s -> 12498.38s]  that I would have loved?
[12498.38s -> 12506.32s]  I guess is the question.
[12506.32s -> 12511.84s]  Not really, maybe, yeah, probably.
[12511.84s -> 12513.08s]  I think it really depends, right?
[12513.08s -> 12515.70s]  I guess it's possible I would play Tears of the Kingdom
[12515.70s -> 12517.58s]  and prefer Breath of the Wild.
[12517.62s -> 12521.47s]  Maybe, I don't know.
[12521.47s -> 12534.38s]  Some complaints remain and yeah, a lot of funny stuff.
[12534.38s -> 12535.22s]  That's cool.
[12535.22s -> 12538.47s]  All right, well, I'm ready to play punch out.
[12538.47s -> 12540.19s]  I promised I would beat Breath of the Wild.
[12540.19s -> 12541.87s]  That was not Tears of the Kingdom.
[12541.87s -> 12544.34s]  I know a lot of people may have been like,
[12544.34s -> 12547.58s]  what is he, why is he playing this game?
[12547.58s -> 12549.82s]  But yeah, finished it.
[12549.82s -> 12552.02s]  Hell yeah, I'm happy about it.
[12552.02s -> 12553.86s]  All right, now let me go pee
[12553.86s -> 12554.70s]  and then we're gonna come back
[12554.70s -> 12557.72s]  and do the punch out challenge.
[12557.72s -> 12558.68s]  I'll be right back.
