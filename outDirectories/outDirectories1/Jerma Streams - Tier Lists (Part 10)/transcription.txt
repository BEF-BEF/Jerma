[16.06s -> 40.84s]  I can't put it on here. What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, hold on. I think I got it.
[44.71s -> 55.32s]  There we go. All right. All right. Let's do a bread tier list. Look up the ending.
[57.10s -> 67.59s]  I don't... true endings. I don't need true ending. That doesn't have to be true ending.
[72.82s -> 75.22s]  All right, let's get it. Bread tier list.
[80.66s -> 92.38s]  Oh, it's just small. My windows always get so fucked up.
[99.48s -> 103.99s]  Okay. So this is a very important tier list for a lot of you, I think.
[106.76s -> 110.36s]  Um, I can see it better. All right, I'm gonna... I'm quitting this. We don't need to be in here
[110.36s -> 112.84s]  anymore. This is... that game was really cool. It was really like just a chill game.
[113.08s -> 126.15s]  I liked it a lot. All right, bread tier list. I'm ready. Put on Olive Garden music for this.
[126.15s -> 143.27s]  Actually kind of a fucking good idea. There's a lot on this list. All right, right there.
[143.91s -> 152.38s]  That's where it is. All right, let's make it a little bigger. All right, you guys ready?
[152.38s -> 159.24s]  The quintessential bread tier list. Sourdough's number one.
[160.60s -> 161.24s]  What the fuck?
[163.24s -> 168.28s]  Oh my god. No, it's not. I want that person timed out. I actually want you timed out.
[168.28s -> 180.36s]  Uh, can we make this IRL? I need music though. You're right.
[180.36s -> 197.69s]  Uh, Garden... Olive Garden music? Olive Garden theme song. Club remix? It's a club remix.
[198.41s -> 215.24s]  Why is there a club remix of this? This is a club remix. This is Olive Garden?
[215.88s -> 231.67s]  I don't think this is even the Olive Garden. Okay, here we go. Bagel. That's a straight up A.
[233.61s -> 239.53s]  Bagel can be used as a sandwich topping. Can be used as a breakfast, as a lunch, as a dinner.
[239.53s -> 244.49s]  You can do bagels and lox. You can do bagels, eggs, and cheese. You can do bagel tuna sandwich.
[244.49s -> 254.12s]  Versatility. Hawaiian roll. S. Hawaiian roll S. 100%. No fighting me on that one. Hawaiian rolls
[254.12s -> 266.71s]  are S. S. If you buy a bag of Hawaiian rolls, you better be ready for that bag to be gone
[266.71s -> 279.61s]  within a day. Within one day. They don't last long. You will never take a bag of Hawaiian rolls
[280.33s -> 284.33s]  and turn it like this and go, is that mold? Oh no, there's like eight. There's like how many
[284.33s -> 287.77s]  slices are in there? One, two, three, four, five. I think that's mold. Nope. Never gonna happen.
[287.77s -> 296.42s]  It's gone every time. Oatmeal bread. Yeah. Okay. Rye bread. Uh, it's a D. Unless it's with a
[296.42s -> 310.31s]  Reuben sandwich and then it becomes a B. Brioche? A. Bagels are better. A whole wheat bread? I guess
[310.31s -> 316.74s]  it's an F. I fucking hate wheat bread. It sucks. I feel... I know. I... When anytime anybody says,
[316.74s -> 322.39s]  hey, whiter wheat. I go, bro, white every time. Like I don't like wheat bread. I just don't.
[322.95s -> 327.75s]  It just makes it taste different. It tastes... Bread to me is texture and a little bit of flavor.
[328.55s -> 333.83s]  Whole wheat bread changes like the flavor of a sandwich. Sure. I don't care. Call me whatever
[333.83s -> 338.47s]  you want. Banana bread. This is a very close to S. I'm not sure I want to put this in S. I'm gonna
[338.47s -> 343.03s]  put it in A. It depends. There's really shitty banana bread and there's really great banana bread.
[343.67s -> 350.57s]  There's banana breads that are dog shit, but if you get a moist, a dense moist banana bread,
[351.45s -> 358.87s]  wow, that's absolute A+. Cornbread is also the same. There's a lot of really shitty cornbread.
[359.67s -> 368.18s]  Dry cornbread. If you get the real good stuff, this might level up. Maybe. Depends. I think it's...
[368.18s -> 377.53s]  I think so. Cinnamon bread. F. I'm sorry. I just don't like it. I am not a fan of cinnamon.
[378.17s -> 383.19s]  You all know that. Everybody knows that at this point. This channel has been... This channel
[383.19s -> 388.42s]  started with me hating cinnamon. I don't really like cinnamon as a condiment, as a seasoning. I'm
[388.42s -> 391.86s]  not a fan. I actually don't think it belongs... These actually probably both don't belong in F,
[393.05s -> 402.28s]  but... Are people saying quackity? What do you mean quackity? What? Oh, they gifted subs.
[403.91s -> 414.17s]  What's up, quackity? Anyways, we're doing good takes here. Croissants. Croissants are an S for
[414.25s -> 420.46s]  flavor, but an F for practicality. Eating a croissant, you have to vacuum your shirt.
[421.86s -> 439.00s]  What is this song? This is not Olive Garden. Yeah, when you eat croissants, they're delicious,
[439.00s -> 443.16s]  but you literally have to vacuum your clothes afterwards. Hold on. I'll put it in the right
[443.16s -> 451.11s]  spot. I need some restaurant music. Here we go. There we go. That's more Olive Garden.
[455.27s -> 461.48s]  Croissant is F for malleability, mandible ability, whatever it's called.
[463.24s -> 468.12s]  We're talking flavor only, and I have like a tray underneath that I can catch the croissant
[468.12s -> 476.97s]  crumbles. I'm going to give it an A. Biscuits. Some biscuits, they're dry as fuck a lot of times,
[476.97s -> 478.89s]  but you know what? I'm going to have to... People are going to be mad about this,
[478.89s -> 485.90s]  but I'm going to give it a B. I already know where this is going, so I need to do this now.
[485.90s -> 490.78s]  Let's get this out of the way, because people are going to be mad. English muffins are horrible.
[492.86s -> 498.50s]  English muffins just have a bad taste. I don't like it. I don't really... I really don't like
[498.50s -> 507.99s]  English muffins. English muffins to me taste like somebody made a bagel biscuit, like a biscuit,
[508.63s -> 514.25s]  and they put a droplet of artificial bread flavoring on it. I don't know. I don't like
[514.25s -> 520.41s]  the taste. It tastes like baby powder. When I bite into an English muffin, it's like baby powder.
[522.15s -> 530.09s]  Okay, a McDonald's sausage egg McMuffin. Yeah, I'd eat it. That brings it up to here,
[530.73s -> 534.06s]  but I really don't like English muffins. I'm sorry. I just don't.
[536.73s -> 544.07s]  I don't... What is it? What is yeast bread? What is that? Yeast bread? Isn't that just bread? I kind
[544.07s -> 552.14s]  of don't really know what that is, so I'm going to... What is it? Just bread? Bagels are failed
[552.14s -> 562.62s]  donuts. They're vile creations. A bagel is amazing. A bagel is versatile. I'm just going to... I don't
[562.62s -> 570.18s]  know what to put this on. Potato bread. Yes. Potato bread is everything I like about white bread,
[570.18s -> 574.66s]  but it's not just default shitty white bread, right? But I like default shitty white bread.
[576.86s -> 579.98s]  I don't think it's better than Hawaiian roll, but I think potato bread is like... If you want
[579.98s -> 586.38s]  white bread, potato bread is like the cool version. I love potato bread. It's fantastic.
[590.50s -> 593.46s]  Not only does this have cinnamon in it, it has gross raisins too.
[594.10s -> 603.14s]  This is going down here. Cinnamon raisin bread. No, I'm just not into it. Where's white bread? Let's
[603.14s -> 615.34s]  do it. White bread is like a B. No, white bread is like a C. I probably would rather eat white
[615.34s -> 620.84s]  bread than oatmeal bread though, because what even... What is oatmeal bread? I don't like
[620.84s -> 628.46s]  cinnamons. I don't like cinnamons, like raisins and shit. I don't like that. Flat bread is... It's
[628.46s -> 634.70s]  all right. It's good for like little sandwich rolls and everything. Tortilla. Flour tortilla.
[634.70s -> 641.32s]  Is corn tortilla on here? Well, that wouldn't be bread, would it? Okay, but this is S. I love
[641.32s -> 652.34s]  tortilla. A good flour tortilla. Cook it on the stove. Oh yeah. Hell yeah. Absolutely. So good.
[653.22s -> 661.54s]  So good. Sourdough. Sourdough is... I would say it kind of reminds me of
[663.46s -> 680.63s]  biting into something like... You know why I don't like sourdough bread? Here's why. That's why.
[683.58s -> 690.90s]  Every piece of sourdough I've ever had feels like that. Oh, wow. Oh, sourdough. Oh my god,
[690.90s -> 707.40s]  it's so fresh. I can feel it in my mouth. I have to bite down hard. No. The sourdough flavor
[709.02s -> 721.98s]  is up here. I'm willing to forgive sourdough for being like tough and chewy. Plus too, it still
[721.98s -> 731.32s]  fucks though. Why are you fucking bread? What are you talking about? I'd say it's... I'm going to
[731.32s -> 739.35s]  give it a B. I think it tastes good. It's better than white bread. Garlic bread. Oh, garlic bread.
[740.07s -> 743.11s]  Garlic bread's... But that's just a meme answer though. Do I really think garlic bread's better
[743.11s -> 755.42s]  than like banana bread? Okay, is garlic bread better than cornbread? I don't think so. I mean,
[755.42s -> 762.50s]  I love garlic bread, but is it better than like a good moist banana bread? Probably not. Or a good
[762.50s -> 768.39s]  bagel? Like a fresh bagel. God, if you get a fresh bagel from like a bagel factory, one of those like
[768.39s -> 773.19s]  bagel factories restaurants where they make the bagels there and they're fresh and you get it hot
[773.19s -> 783.03s]  right in the morning, I think it's better. I do. French bread is in the same category as croissant.
[783.03s -> 786.79s]  It's another bread that when you take a bite out of it, you need like a little dirt devil to vacuum
[786.79s -> 791.75s]  your like crotch because it just gets everywhere, but it's fucking unbelievable. I think it's better
[791.75s -> 797.35s]  than croissant. I think it's better than brioche too. French bread just like is garlic bread just
[797.35s -> 811.50s]  with stuff on it. So what is it? Does it really matter where it goes? Whole grain bread is at the
[811.50s -> 822.15s]  very bottom. I would rather eat cinnamon raisin bread off the ground than eat a piece of whole
[822.15s -> 833.56s]  grain bread. It's awful. I know. Oh, you're like, you have like a 10 year old's palette.
[834.52s -> 839.56s]  Whole grain bread sucks and everybody knows it. You don't bite into whole like all like the weird
[839.56s -> 845.72s]  like nuts and shit. I don't like the plastic tasting things. It's like the big chunks of like
[846.28s -> 852.78s]  grains and like little like seeds on it. It's like, it's like bird food to me. It's like bird seed
[852.78s -> 855.98s]  all over it. I don't like it. It's got bird seed all over it. I don't like whole grain bread. I
[855.98s -> 866.10s]  think it's bad. Pretzel bread is up here. In fact, pretzel bread is better than Hawaiian rolls.
[866.98s -> 871.62s]  I might come back to that in a minute. I might come back to this in just a moment,
[872.18s -> 883.88s]  but pretzel bread could be the best thing in the world. Bread-wise, I think. We'll see. I can change
[883.88s -> 892.65s]  it if I need to. Well, okay, potato bread is not a 10 year old palette. That's like pretty
[892.65s -> 899.94s]  sophisticated. Hawaiian rolls, that's a sophisticated palette. Pita bread's pretty good. I think it's
[899.94s -> 911.32s]  like a B. I love gyros, so pita bread's usually pretty fantastic. This with hummus is fantastic.
[911.96s -> 923.85s]  I don't think I would put it up here though. I mean, breadsticks are fine, but they're fine.
[924.94s -> 928.46s]  I like breadsticks. I don't think they're better than like a croissant. Actually,
[928.46s -> 932.81s]  yeah. I probably, okay, do I, would I rather have a breadstick or a pita bread?
[932.81s -> 939.70s]  Probably a breadstick. I might have to reevaluate this in a minute in a little bit here. We'll see.
[940.26s -> 945.94s]  All right, this is the bread from Outback. We know where that's going. Up here somewhere.
[946.66s -> 954.82s]  But okay, pumpernickel bread and croissants are the exact same in my brain. I need to be
[955.54s -> 960.10s]  in the mood to eat a croissant. I don't just like, oh, you know what? Yeah, I'll have a croissant
[960.10s -> 967.72s]  today. That'd be a reason why I get it, why I eat it. Pumpernickel is like, I have to have a reason
[967.72s -> 973.96s]  to eat it. I don't go to the store and go like, oh yeah, yeah, where's the pumpernickel bread?
[974.52s -> 978.12s]  No, I usually get like potato bread or the stick of white bread or even a wheat bread sometimes.
[978.68s -> 986.09s]  Is the bread from Outback? Yeah, it is good. That's why it's an A. It's up an A tier. What
[986.09s -> 997.38s]  are you talking about? Outback bread is white bread painted brown. Is it really? No, it's not.
[999.05s -> 1013.22s]  What is the bread from Outback? It's not pumpernickel? What is the bread at Outback?
[1013.78s -> 1021.90s]  What is the bread at Outback made out of? Honey and molasses wheat bread roll.
[1021.90s -> 1041.93s]  But no, wheat bread sucks. Wait, that's a honey and molasses. Honey and molasses wheat bread roll.
[1041.93s -> 1046.57s]  Not just generic ass wheat bread. No, they're both going down here. Fuck them both.
[1047.90s -> 1056.10s]  Fuck them both. Who cares? Non is up at A, high A. To me, a non is like a pita bread, but like
[1056.10s -> 1064.26s]  evolved. Pita bread's like the squirtle and non is like the squirrel mo, whatever his name is,
[1064.26s -> 1070.34s]  whatever. Non is just like kind of upgraded pita bread. I don't think it's better than garlic,
[1070.34s -> 1077.93s]  but it actually might be. Maybe. Pumpernickel, I like pumpernickel. Why is it down here?
[1077.93s -> 1083.96s]  It's definitely like up here. It'd be zucchini bread. I don't know. That's some TikTok shit.
[1084.04s -> 1104.31s]  I don't want it. Butter bread and butter bread. What is it? What are these? I don't think I've
[1104.31s -> 1110.63s]  had these before. I don't think I've eaten butter bread. I don't think I've had it.
[1110.63s -> 1117.66s]  Where would I have eaten this? My grandmother makes zucchini bread, dude. That's not TikTok shit.
[1125.27s -> 1132.55s]  I don't know. It's zucchini bread? The Chick-fil-A minis are butter bread. I don't, I don't,
[1132.55s -> 1137.77s]  I can't think of, I can't remember what it tastes like. What it is like, right? All right, let me
[1137.77s -> 1143.54s]  make sure this is correct. Pretzel bread, yep. Wine roll, this is tough. Yeah, this is right.
[1143.54s -> 1157.77s]  I think my S tier is right. A good fresh French roll, though. God damn it, it's good. I'm trying
[1157.77s -> 1164.60s]  to think of like biting into like a moist, delicious, savory, aromatic piece of banana
[1164.60s -> 1168.65s]  bread. You know what I mean? The kind of bread where you can go like this with the bread,
[1169.21s -> 1175.21s]  squish it and you let go and it does not come back to form factor. It's squished. It's fucking
[1175.21s -> 1205.38s]  squished. Oh, that changed my mind. No, cornbread or flour tortilla. I feel like brioche is just
[1205.38s -> 1214.76s]  better than most of these somehow, right? But I don't know. I love bagels so much. I can eat
[1214.76s -> 1218.98s]  bagels, breakfast, breakfast, lunch. Why can't I say the K in breakfast? I could eat a bagel,
[1218.98s -> 1230.86s]  breakfast, lunch and dinner and be happy about it. Here's the exact same tier list from a year
[1230.86s -> 1254.82s]  and a half ago that you did. What? Are you serious? I did this already? This is my list?
[1254.82s -> 1260.49s]  I did this already? So what does it look like? Oh, someone's got a screenshot. Here we go. Wait,
[1260.49s -> 1267.24s]  hold on. I need to compare. Let's compare it. It's pretty fucking close, guys. It's pretty close.
[1267.88s -> 1281.16s]  It's pretty close. It's close, man. Hold on. If I were to stop this right now, right? Let's overlay
[1281.16s -> 1300.17s]  it. Yo, this is pretty much the same. This is pretty good. What's not up here? Croissant is
[1300.17s -> 1312.58s]  up at S now. Potato bread, potato bread. Pretzel bread, pretzel bread. Croissant. I must have had
[1312.58s -> 1317.90s]  a shitty croissant. I must add a shitty croissant. You know, at some point over the last two years,
[1317.90s -> 1326.66s]  I probably bit into a croissant and went fuck and got pissed. That is what happened.
[1326.66s -> 1331.06s]  Banana bread. Yeah, I must have had a really moist banana bread. Biscuit. Biscuits. Whoa,
[1331.06s -> 1339.78s]  it took a nose dive here. Pita bread took a dive. Then flatbread took a dive. Cornbread evolved.
[1342.39s -> 1349.90s]  White bread kind of jumped up. Oatmeal bread. Okay, but yeah, but remember, all these things
[1349.90s -> 1355.38s]  that are in D, I was afraid to piss off like the bread andies in chat, right? So I couldn't make
[1355.38s -> 1367.58s]  them F. Where's garlic bread on this? Wow, garlic bread was a fucking C. I stand by my list. You did
[1367.58s -> 1375.59s]  this exact same list already. I'm kind of curious. What does somebody... I did a fast food one.
[1375.59s -> 1396.36s]  Are my tastes kind of the same? You were wearing the same shirt. I was? No, I wasn't. You just
[1396.36s -> 1401.29s]  did the fast food. What's another one that I've done? What's some of the popular ones? It's like
[1401.29s -> 1407.64s]  candy, soda, chips and stuff, right? What's one that I haven't done in a while that I have done
[1407.64s -> 1419.29s]  to see if... Because I don't remember. I don't remember anything. Cheese's baby food. You did
[1419.29s -> 1430.12s]  fruits before. Pumpkin bread. I don't like it. You did the same grin. You didn't do cookie run
[1430.12s -> 1442.97s]  characters yet. All right, so should I... What's another one? This is done. I'm happy with this.
[1442.97s -> 1452.12s]  Should I do like soda, candy? Is there a good candy one? I've been eating a shitload of candy
[1452.12s -> 1459.02s]  lately. Should I do a candy or something? What do you think? I've been eating a lot of candy. I've
[1459.02s -> 1466.52s]  been really into candy lately. Do alcohol? I could do that. I don't even need a tier list. Vodka,
[1466.52s -> 1473.58s]  S, everything else fucking like F, besides like whiskey at like an A. Beer, F. Wine, like A. There
[1473.58s -> 1484.15s]  you go. Is there a good candy one? You did candy in 2020. Okay, so it's been about two years. I
[1484.15s -> 1498.30s]  don't remember what I did. So is there a good candy one? Give me a good candy one. He have two
[1498.30s -> 1505.08s]  unusual hats. I don't even know. Guys, I've seen like three unusual hats my whole life. Have you
[1505.08s -> 1510.46s]  eaten much candy since then? Yeah, I think so. There's a candy tier list right here. Let's check
[1510.46s -> 1516.34s]  it out. Vodka, is that so? Yeah, because vodka goes with like almost everything. That's the only reason
[1516.34s -> 1523.59s]  why. I like whiskey too, but vodka is like easier for me to drink. I don't really drink that much
[1523.59s -> 1528.76s]  hard alcohol. Usually it's just a wine or like champagne or something, right? Okay, candy.
[1531.00s -> 1544.62s]  Let me put it down. Okay, how long is this? This is gonna take like an hour. This is gonna take like
[1544.62s -> 1562.36s]  a fucking hour, isn't it? This doesn't feel complete. Is this complete? What do you guys think?
[1562.92s -> 1572.25s]  Is there more on here that should be on here? No, this looks pretty complete. Is it the same
[1572.25s -> 1585.40s]  one that I did? I think this looks kind of complete. What's it missing? Looks pretty good.
[1585.96s -> 1599.48s]  Looks good. Okay, let's start at the with the easy stuff that I know. Um, Reese's Pieces are an A,
[1599.48s -> 1604.31s]  although eating more than like what? What's touching my leg? What? I honestly got there was
[1604.31s -> 1618.98s]  like a fucking thing on my leg. What was that? Okay, uh, Reese's Pieces are pretty good. I would
[1618.98s -> 1626.10s]  say they're A. I would say Twizzlers are D or F. D is fine. We can use it as F. Twizzlers are gross.
[1626.98s -> 1631.06s]  There's only one kind of Twizzler I like and it's the ones where you peel, you peel the Twizzlers.
[1631.70s -> 1638.10s]  Those are pretty good. Bazooka Gum. If you can find one that isn't as hard as a rock,
[1639.30s -> 1646.33s]  that's, I'd say that's pretty solid B. A hundred grand. I remember the commercials where they'd
[1646.33s -> 1650.73s]  say, what would you do with a hundred grand? I'd eat it. So that gets a B for like funny commercial.
[1650.73s -> 1658.39s]  No, it doesn't. Let's just get this out of the way. Reese's the best candy. Reese's are the best
[1658.39s -> 1664.94s]  candy. There's no, I honestly, I don't think there's any argument to be made. There really isn't.
[1665.34s -> 1675.75s]  No, there is no argument to make. It's the best candy. It's the best chocolate candy.
[1676.82s -> 1681.53s]  You know what else? I'm going to give Reese's a little bit of credit here. They also haven't
[1681.53s -> 1687.64s]  changed shit. There's been no new recipe for Reese's. It's the same goddamn shit it was like
[1687.64s -> 1692.76s]  50 years ago. Think about it. Remember, think about the things that you think about that go like,
[1692.76s -> 1697.16s]  oh man, back in the nineties when like it tasted better and they used like fucking whatever.
[1697.72s -> 1709.67s]  It's the same. This has not changed in like fucking 40 years. Sour Patch Kids. Nah,
[1709.67s -> 1717.70s]  I don't like these. They're, I like eating like one or two. I like them, but I just, I only want
[1717.70s -> 1729.54s]  like two. I really only want like two. I'll keep it in B for now. I know they're good. I like them,
[1729.54s -> 1736.15s]  but I just don't, I don't want to eat like a whole bag. Bubble Tape is A. If you can find it,
[1738.97s -> 1742.65s]  it's amazing. Although it does have like the weird like baby powder shit on it.
[1750.02s -> 1758.65s]  I'll keep it for now. I love it though. Sweet Tarts. Are these the, yep, those are S. Absolutely,
[1758.65s -> 1765.94s]  100%. Sweet Tarts are so delicious. They're so yummy. I can eat a Sweet Tart and it's the same
[1765.94s -> 1775.08s]  exact thing. Sweet Tarts are Sour Patch Kids, but good. Sweet Tarts are like Sour Candy, Sour Patch
[1775.08s -> 1784.65s]  Kids. They're just like a better version in my brain than a Sour Patch Kid. I just feel that way.
[1785.59s -> 1790.23s]  Fun Dip is also kind of, I can only do it once or twice. It's good, but I don't know. I'll keep it
[1790.23s -> 1802.41s]  in B for now. Mike and Ike's, I don't, there's just no reason to eat them. Original Tootsie Rolls.
[1802.41s -> 1811.74s]  These are, they're, they're not, I don't know. They're kind of just the, Heath Bar is like a C
[1811.74s -> 1819.78s]  or a B, but if it's part of ice cream, it's S. Like Heath Bar Crunch Ice Cream, S+. I'd say it's
[1819.78s -> 1828.97s]  probably, I'm going to give it a high B. I like it. Warheads, again, like I just like Sweet Tarts
[1828.97s -> 1832.33s]  better. I don't, I don't know. They're good, but you can, you only eat one. After you eat more than
[1832.33s -> 1840.26s]  one, it's like, you're going to fucking, I feel like I'm going to throw up. I'll put it C. Kit Kats
[1840.26s -> 1851.00s]  are up high. Come around A. I'll fix it. Andy's Mints, S+, tried and true for like 500 years.
[1854.39s -> 1858.78s]  I may have changed my opinion on this. I don't remember what I gave this like two or three years
[1858.78s -> 1864.22s]  ago, but Andy's Mints have been tried and true, delicious, perfect. It's a perfect serving size.
[1864.22s -> 1868.14s]  You only need like one of them, one or two, just one or two. That's it. And it's completely
[1868.14s -> 1878.55s]  satisfying. It's a perfect combination of chocolate, mint. It's perfect. It's S. In fact, now that I
[1878.55s -> 1883.75s]  know what's right next to Sweet Tarts here, this is A. This is only for the most prestigious candy.
[1884.47s -> 1893.00s]  And Andy's are up there as, as probably, you know what? No, how dare you even get your,
[1893.00s -> 1899.56s]  get your hand away from there. How dare you? I like just reached it. I just got like slapped
[1899.56s -> 1906.26s]  by like mom going to get like the food. Okay. Three Musketeers. I'm going to shock a lot of you with
[1906.26s -> 1913.34s]  this one. This is a high A. The fluffy, the fluffy nougat in the middle. Oh, it's so good.
[1913.90s -> 1922.41s]  It's so fluffy and so like just puffy and fluffy. So yummy. So good. I love it. A plus.
[1925.16s -> 1936.30s]  It's literally air. What are these? Are these, are these, what are these gummies? What are those?
[1936.30s -> 1946.71s]  These are Swedish fish. They are Swedish fish, aren't they? F. I don't get this. I don't think
[1946.71s -> 1953.10s]  I ever will. I don't understand why people like these. Don't, I really don't like them at all.
[1955.00s -> 1961.48s]  They're just like kind of slimy and like chewy. I don't get it. I just, I honestly just don't get
[1961.48s -> 1969.05s]  it. I know that that's the worst take I've had, but man, these are just not good. I just, this is
[1969.05s -> 1978.94s]  not good. They're fruity. Yeah, but like I would rather just have gummy bears. The Haribo gummy,
[1978.94s -> 1982.78s]  are the Haribo gummy bears on here? Because those, they're just a way better version of these.
[1982.78s -> 1991.08s]  Like a hundred times better. I mean like 100 times better. It's like the same thing in my head.
[1994.97s -> 1998.89s]  Are they on? There they are. Yeah. Yeah. Haribo gummy bears are, wait, these are big ones. I'm
[1998.89s -> 2005.46s]  going to take these as just like the little ones. These are perfect. Yeah. These are like, hey,
[2005.46s -> 2014.84s]  these are great. Yeah. Swedish fish, you chew, you chew them up. And then after like 10 to 20
[2014.84s -> 2021.70s]  minutes, you realize that you have this like, like weird, like red, like cement paste that's aligning
[2021.70s -> 2034.04s]  all of your gums. It's like, no, I don't know. I don't like it. I don't think there's any list
[2034.04s -> 2040.81s]  that you'll ever see that has peeps higher than an F4D. If somebody genuinely had peeps up here,
[2041.61s -> 2046.22s]  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a little concerned. I think I'm concerned about them. I don't think anybody
[2046.22s -> 2051.59s]  puts these up here. I could see how people could put them like here, but an S, I mean,
[2052.31s -> 2060.44s]  I don't know what you're talking about. How would that be possible? No, I don't think anybody puts
[2060.44s -> 2066.28s]  them up there. Peeps are A, yeah, but not S. If you put peeps in S tier, I don't know about that.
[2066.28s -> 2076.97s]  Dots F. Okay. All you Swedish fish Andes, what's the difference between dots and fish besides the
[2077.53s -> 2088.76s]  squished mold that is the fish mold for the candy? What's the difference? I explained. You all say
[2088.76s -> 2093.35s]  dots are the worst candy. Everybody knows dots is the worst candy, but Swedish fish are just like
[2093.35s -> 2106.31s]  flattened out dots. Huh? The shape is important. Do you like dinosaur chicken nuggets more than
[2106.31s -> 2121.51s]  regular chicken nuggets? What are you talking about? Yes. These also suck. They just, it's just,
[2121.51s -> 2125.96s]  it takes forever. I don't like the appeal. They're better than peeps. No, they're not. Actually,
[2125.96s -> 2132.66s]  I'd rather eat a peep. It's just, no. Who is going to spit this shit out and eat it later?
[2134.25s -> 2139.99s]  Do you rinse it under the sink? After you suck on this thing for like three hours,
[2139.99s -> 2144.07s]  do you spit it out and like rinse it under the sink and put it in like a bag? I don't know.
[2148.34s -> 2156.58s]  Twix, that's going up here. I've had Twix before that were really like pillowy and delicious,
[2157.14s -> 2162.36s]  but I have to be honest. I've had Twix before that were kind of stale. They're like the,
[2162.36s -> 2167.19s]  it's just something, something's off. You know what I mean? Something's off. I've had that
[2167.19s -> 2176.84s]  experience a few times. Razzlers? Holy shit. I just, I gotta remember these being good. Sweet
[2176.84s -> 2183.66s]  tarts. They're on the same level. This is the candy necklace. That's up there too. Pretty like
[2183.66s -> 2190.81s]  a high B. York pep man patties. That's up there too. These are phenomenal. It's that perfect like
[2190.81s -> 2196.09s]  ice. Okay. I think of, I think of a commercial when you bite into a York pep man patty and it's like,
[2197.70s -> 2206.57s]  I hear that. I hear like a, and I think of like snow being around me. It's perfect.
[2206.57s -> 2217.72s]  Airheads are all right. They're, I don't know if I put airheads, maybe I put them like here.
[2217.72s -> 2222.42s]  I don't think I would rather, I'd rather have a Kit Kat than an airhead. I'm way more chocolate
[2222.42s -> 2231.29s]  oriented than I am like sweet fruit sugary kind of oriented. Look at this list with the exception
[2231.29s -> 2236.25s]  of like sweet tarts. Like most of my stuff up here is like chocolate mint, chocolate, chocolate,
[2236.25s -> 2241.88s]  chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. I, I, it's all right. It's all right. I like it. I don't know.
[2241.88s -> 2248.87s]  Why is this even on here? I don't even know what a baby Ruth tastes like. I just noticed a shit
[2248.87s -> 2258.54s]  load of peanuts. So I don't, I don't think I've had it. Uh, lifesavers are pretty good. I actually,
[2258.54s -> 2263.50s]  it's not on here, I don't think, but I prefer the like mint spear mint lifesavers over the fruity
[2263.50s -> 2269.35s]  ones. Can I pretend that these are the mint ones? You know, I talk about the little individually
[2269.35s -> 2278.17s]  packaged, um, mint spearmint ones. Oh, that's amazing. This is so good. The mint ones are
[2278.17s -> 2287.11s]  better. Okay. I'm just going to pretend these are the mint ones. This is okay. This is that candy
[2287.11s -> 2293.34s]  that's in that group of candy that's at every gas station that's in the bags. And it's like just all
[2293.34s -> 2302.12s]  the weird oddity like circus shit, right? There's all this, uh, the gas station has this one row of
[2302.12s -> 2312.46s]  just like with these weird bag candies. And I'm not a big fan. Circus peanuts. Yeah, circus peanuts
[2312.46s -> 2318.34s]  are okay. I actually kind of like eating one and going like, yeah, I remember that's what that is.
[2318.34s -> 2324.18s]  And then I never eat another one ever again. I don't think they just, they don't belong down
[2324.18s -> 2338.65s]  here. Hmm. Okay. Just general Hershey's bar. I mean, it's part of one of my favorite desserts
[2338.65s -> 2345.50s]  ever, which is s'mores, but by itself, like, I mean, there's, there's other things I would rather
[2345.50s -> 2357.21s]  have. A Hershey bar is fine. It's fine. But if you have Kit Kat available, that's at the same rack,
[2357.21s -> 2362.18s]  I'm going to, I'm going to get Kit Kat. If you have three musketeers and Hershey's right next
[2362.18s -> 2369.26s]  to each other, I'm never going to take the Hershey bar ever. But if you were like, Hey man,
[2369.26s -> 2373.26s]  do you want some chocolate? I got Hershey's. I'd be like, yeah, sure. That's fine. Sounds good.
[2373.26s -> 2384.41s]  That sounds fine. But I don't think it's probably C. Um, hot, hot tamales. This is like the hot, uh,
[2384.41s -> 2392.54s]  cinnamon candy. I'd actually probably rather eat this than candy corn. Cinnamon, like can't, no,
[2392.54s -> 2406.55s]  thanks. S'mores are the only place Hershey's are good. Yeah. I mean, you're right, but it's one of
[2406.55s -> 2416.65s]  the reasons why it's so good, right? What are these? These, are these nerds? S. Nerds are S.
[2419.00s -> 2421.72s]  And again, another reason why you're probably seeing a pattern up here.
[2423.05s -> 2428.02s]  The nerds formula has never changed. It's the same formula it's been since like a
[2428.02s -> 2433.51s]  nineteen fucking hundred, since like 1830 or whatever, when these were invented, they have
[2433.51s -> 2441.59s]  never changed. They've been exactly the same and they're really good. They're gross. I like them.
[2441.59s -> 2450.41s]  I think they're good. Ring pop is fine. I probably put it over here. It's just like a lollipop,
[2450.41s -> 2458.02s]  whatever. It's just, it's a lollipop that's shaped in an interesting way. They're okay. Fireball,
[2458.02s -> 2464.74s]  again, gross cinnamon candy. That's like just hot, like cinnamon fireball kind of, you know,
[2465.06s -> 2475.64s]  thank you. Milky way is just three musketeer, but way worse, but it's not that bad. It's good.
[2475.64s -> 2484.09s]  It's just not, it doesn't even, not even come close to me. Doesn't even come close. Three
[2484.09s -> 2487.53s]  musketeers are just like kind of like a whipped up kind of fluffy version and it's way better.
[2491.85s -> 2504.60s]  It's pocky. Is that pocky? No, these are candy cigarettes. Okay. These are gross. These are
[2504.60s -> 2510.86s]  actually really gross. Have you ever eaten a candy cigarette? It kind of reminds me of like
[2512.06s -> 2525.10s]  what plaster would taste like. I think it, you know, I know, no thanks. Pixie sticks. These are
[2525.10s -> 2530.10s]  all right. I'm going to put pixie sticks next to Fun Dip because they're literally the exact same
[2530.10s -> 2536.23s]  thing. There is no difference besides a stick that you lick. Nothing else is different. I would eat
[2536.23s -> 2546.78s]  it though. Some of these are going to be hard to place. I would say Starburst is S, but I don't
[2546.78s -> 2552.54s]  know. They kind of fell off for me. They kind of fell way down. Yeah, they fell way down for me.
[2553.18s -> 2559.13s]  I don't know why. Something about it. Something, I think, something about it. It's not really,
[2559.13s -> 2570.54s]  I don't really care. Smiders are great. I actually really enjoy these. Is it A though? It's probably
[2570.54s -> 2580.44s]  B. These are the same to me. I would put Smarties, Candy Necklace, and Pez right next to each other.
[2580.44s -> 2586.12s]  They're in the same like genre of video game kind of candy. You know what I mean? They're in the same
[2586.12s -> 2596.98s]  exact genre. Where's Pez? There it is. I think Pez is probably the best, but to me they're like,
[2596.98s -> 2604.49s]  they're in the same flavor profile. They're the same like movie genre. Like this is Jason, this
[2604.49s -> 2609.02s]  is Freddy, and this is like Michael Myers. You know what I mean? It's like they're the, I'm getting
[2609.02s -> 2619.51s]  the same thing out of it. Nestle Crunch. I feel like it's been a while, but I do remember eating
[2619.51s -> 2626.95s]  it. I'm thinking it was good. I think Crackle might be better. Is Crackle on here? Can I pretend this
[2626.95s -> 2642.79s]  is Crackle? I think Crackle actually might be better. What the fuck is Crackle? Crackle?
[2642.79s -> 2646.87s]  Is it the red wrapper? I think Crackle is better, but I think this is still good.
[2648.33s -> 2654.14s]  I don't think it's better than Kit Kat, but it's close. No it's not. Actually, you know what it is?
[2654.14s -> 2660.89s]  Actually it is. I think it is. All right, like Cookie Dough Bites. I don't think I've ever eaten
[2660.89s -> 2672.22s]  these. Fruit Gushers. Is this like a candy? Are Gushers candy or are they fruit snack? Right?
[2672.22s -> 2681.58s]  Isn't it? It's kind of a difference, isn't there? I don't like think Gushers are candy. I like them a
[2681.58s -> 2692.34s]  lot though. I don't like that you open the bag and you go take one out and like you get the like
[2693.22s -> 2696.58s]  the like streamer wall. You know what I mean? With all like the hexagons that are like
[2697.78s -> 2704.52s]  you get like the like hexagon streamer wall when you pull it out. It's all connected and shit.
[2706.65s -> 2720.01s]  I'd like to eat one at a time, but they're good. I'd rather have a gummy bear, but I actually do
[2720.01s -> 2723.42s]  like these. I think they're good. I know that's a gross take for a lot of people. They really
[2723.42s -> 2728.97s]  don't like that. People think Gushers are gross. When was the last time you had them?
[2732.55s -> 2739.22s]  Lemonheads are horrible, aren't they? But they're good. They're like they're here.
[2739.86s -> 2746.50s]  It's like this is like the same thing in my brain. Any candy where you put it in your mouth and you
[2746.50s -> 2756.02s]  go like like it's like the same thing. The same movie. It's the same like genre. It fits in the
[2756.02s -> 2764.87s]  same spot. I think they're okay. They're chewy, aren't they? These are the ones where they're
[2764.87s -> 2769.91s]  yellow and then when you like suck all the juice off them they turn into white like chewy little
[2769.91s -> 2779.32s]  balls, right? I got it right. After you like suck on them for a little while they turn these little
[2779.32s -> 2787.38s]  tiny white like wishy-chewy things. Soft outside, hard inside. I had it backwards. I haven't had
[2787.38s -> 2792.30s]  these in a while, but I do remember thinking they were pretty good. Bob Stoppers. I haven't really
[2792.30s -> 2798.84s]  had them. Tootsie Pops are like Hershey bars. They're fine. I would rather have something else.
[2799.48s -> 2805.86s]  Where are Tootsie Rolls? Did I put them up here? Where is it? There they are. I mean they're like
[2806.50s -> 2811.22s]  these are better than Tootsie Rolls because they're Tootsie Pops. So there's like a
[2811.22s -> 2815.88s]  there's more complex flavors going on, but I still would rather have something else.
[2815.88s -> 2823.62s]  Dolly Ranchers. These are these are up here. I'd say somewhere in A.
[2824.26s -> 2828.25s]  Tommy Bears are a little bit depends. What do you want out of your candy experience?
[2829.18s -> 2832.46s]  Do you want to just eat something and have it disappear and like that's it? That was delicious.
[2832.46s -> 2837.90s]  Move on to the next thing. Or do you want a little bit longer lasting experience? Do you want to eat
[2837.90s -> 2843.51s]  something that's going to last you more than one second? 10 seconds? These are the same to me.
[2843.51s -> 2850.34s]  This is just like extended delayed release tablets. These are like let's go right now.
[2850.34s -> 2854.98s]  Yeah, this is extended release tablets of the same thing. So I like them both.
[2854.98s -> 2865.69s]  It depends on how I feel. We got a Blow Pop, which are way better than Tootsie Pops. I can tell you
[2865.69s -> 2873.54s]  I have not had one in a long time, but I do remember them being phenomenal. Been a while.
[2874.63s -> 2885.77s]  Probably better than Gushers. Charleston Chew. What a legend. Speaking of Charleston Chew,
[2885.77s -> 2894.78s]  where the hell is it? Because that's up here. Where's Charleston Chew? Nope. I already know
[2894.78s -> 2903.21s]  what this is. It's like a gross coconut thing. Dum Dums. I'd rather have a Dum Dum than a Blow
[2903.21s -> 2912.81s]  Pop. They're just easier, quicker. Yeah, Charleston Chews are incredible in the freezer. They have to
[2912.81s -> 2918.79s]  be from the freezer though. They have to be. If a Charleston Chew is in the freezer, it's here
[2918.79s -> 2921.99s]  somewhere in this area. I don't know exactly where, but it's here. Life service are not that
[2921.99s -> 2931.85s]  high. This is going to need some re-combobulating here. Snickers are tried and true. It's kind of
[2931.85s -> 2937.35s]  exactly what you're looking for. Test of time. Been around for like 100 years. They've never
[2937.35s -> 2946.30s]  changed it. It's always just always good. Yeah, just always good. Especially the little ones.
[2946.30s -> 2955.54s]  Oh my god, I almost fell down. The little Snickers, the little individual little squares,
[2956.18s -> 2960.89s]  I think are better than the bars because they make sure that in the little squares,
[2961.45s -> 2971.22s]  it's the exact ratio of everything you want. It's a perfect singular bite of candy. The bar of Snickers
[2971.22s -> 2974.42s]  could, it's kind of, you never know what's going to be in there. You don't know what the ratio is
[2974.42s -> 2980.34s]  like. The little ones, oh yeah, you know exactly what you're getting in there. Absolutely. They're
[2980.34s -> 2992.12s]  up here. Thinking about making a change here. We'll see. M&Ms, they're all right. They're fine,
[2992.12s -> 2999.56s]  but this is just, if they're regular M&Ms, then like, whatever. Peanut butter M&Ms are up here.
[3002.15s -> 3009.64s]  Regular M&Ms, they're, they're, they're, they're reliable. They're reliable. Okay, the chocolate
[3009.64s -> 3016.94s]  inside of an M&M is better than the chocolate on the Hershey's. Like this, you just get like an
[3016.94s -> 3022.90s]  upgraded experience with the candy on the outside. Once you get in there, the chocolate's better,
[3022.90s -> 3029.00s]  it's a better chocolate. It tastes better. M&M's minis are S tier. Oh, you better believe it.
[3029.00s -> 3040.30s]  You better believe it. I think this is probably around here. Again, these fit in the same category.
[3040.30s -> 3045.58s]  Like do I want like the Reese's flavor, or do I want the M&M's flavor? One's not better than
[3045.58s -> 3052.87s]  the other for me. Razzlers get out of here. You don't belong up there. Bubble tape doesn't either.
[3058.23s -> 3064.30s]  Skittles are like, they fell off. Just like Starburst did. They're actually in the same place for
[3064.30s -> 3073.91s]  me. It's just, they kind of fell off for me. I'm not, I'm not a big fan anymore. They're almost like
[3073.91s -> 3080.18s]  too sugary. I know that like I have literally pure sugar up here, right? But something about
[3080.18s -> 3087.22s]  Skittles, they're almost like too sweet. It's like too sugary. I don't know why. Something about it.
[3087.22s -> 3091.06s]  I guess you could say this is like, this is the exact same thing, but even these like taste
[3091.06s -> 3098.31s]  different than this. It's like a different kind of sweetness. Uh, I'm gonna just, I don't, I think
[3098.31s -> 3106.65s]  these are the same, so I'm gonna put them here. Lifesavers, I'm gonna, where are lifesavers? If
[3106.65s -> 3115.14s]  they're in A, it's a mistake. Where are they? Where are they? Didn't I put other lifesavers up here?
[3115.62s -> 3122.46s]  Where'd they go? Bottom of A? All right, okay. Uh, wait, we're pretending that these are mint,
[3123.10s -> 3132.20s]  right? These are like the spirit ones. That's what we're pretending. Um, these are tropical ones. The
[3132.20s -> 3140.78s]  tropical ones are actually pretty good. I would put them somewhere here. They're okay. I would,
[3140.78s -> 3146.52s]  they're good. Hershey's Kisses are better than Hershey's. Again, it's, it's like, it's kind of
[3146.52s -> 3153.11s]  weird because the chocolate in a Hershey's Kiss tastes better than a Hershey bar. I don't know why
[3153.11s -> 3164.02s]  or how. I don't get it. And it's way better somehow. It is way better. Why? Why is that?
[3168.66s -> 3176.28s]  I can't give you a reason why. You just said shape doesn't matter. No, I told you that these are the
[3176.28s -> 3180.76s]  same thing, just different shapes. I also think they're gross. I don't think these are gross.
[3181.32s -> 3186.92s]  I think these are, I think chocolate's good. I think chocolate's good. I think these are gross.
[3187.86s -> 3190.66s]  Yeah, they could be different shapes as long as I think they taste good. That's fine.
[3194.22s -> 3199.64s]  They belong right here, right in the middle. Probably over-funned. Bazooka, what is Bazooka?
[3200.28s -> 3208.06s]  What is this doing up here? Yeah, it's called you chew up the gum for five seconds, read the comic
[3208.06s -> 3217.58s]  book and spit it out. Why was this up here? But that was, those comic books, those comics were
[3217.58s -> 3225.22s]  fire. How cool was that? A tiny little comic with like three or four, five panels. That's
[3225.22s -> 3233.03s]  fucking awesome. What a cool thing. That was really, the wrapper was a comic book. Um, excuse me.
[3233.03s -> 3239.03s]  Yeah, I was wrong. Pop rocks are fun for a second where you, you're like, oh yeah, remember these
[3239.03s -> 3243.91s]  and you do it and you go, okay, I won't eat these for like another three or four years. They're
[3243.91s -> 3250.78s]  all right. You, I don't, you can't put, okay, I know some people are going to put this in S,
[3251.42s -> 3257.70s]  but how do you put something in S that you know you're not going to eat more than like once every
[3257.70s -> 3266.89s]  two or three decades? You know what I mean? Like sure, they're really cool. It's a crazy experience.
[3266.89s -> 3271.37s]  Like it's, wow, look at the pop rocks and it's, oh my God, crunch, crunch. But if I'm only going
[3271.37s -> 3276.14s]  to do this like once every fucking five years, why can I put it up here? Like I said, why would
[3276.14s -> 3287.88s]  I put it up there? It's, it's cool, but it's not. I, I have eaten these. I mean, I ate like five of
[3287.88s -> 3295.94s]  these literally yesterday. So that's why they're up here. Um, this is a funny like experience to
[3295.94s -> 3302.42s]  have, but I don't think it's like a great candy to eat all the time. These are the wax bottles.
[3302.98s -> 3309.43s]  Again, same deal. You're going to remember that the wax bottles exist. You're going to go, oh dude,
[3310.79s -> 3318.06s]  oh my God. Whoa. Oh yeah. Do you remember? Do you remember that? And then you go, both going to go,
[3318.06s -> 3322.46s]  okay, we're not doing that for another decade. We're not doing that again. We're not doing that
[3322.46s -> 3327.26s]  ever again. Like we're going to do it once and then forget it exists for like another five years
[3327.26s -> 3333.59s]  till we remember to do it again. They belong in the same place and they're somehow better than
[3333.59s -> 3342.62s]  Starburst and Skittles, but that experience is cooler than, yeah. Yep. I think so. Almond Joy.
[3342.86s -> 3353.85s]  Mm. I really don't, I really don't like these. I don't like them. I think they're better. These
[3353.85s -> 3360.89s]  are probably better than, yeah, than all this fucking dog shit. You know, it's tough to like
[3360.89s -> 3368.33s]  do these. Somebody said earlier, like you're going to, you're ruining sponsorship opportunities.
[3368.33s -> 3372.97s]  If like Twizzlers for any reason ever, and I'm not saying this is ever going to happen,
[3372.97s -> 3377.61s]  but if any of these companies were ever like, Hey man, we should, you want to like work together?
[3380.28s -> 3387.18s]  And all that was here. Wow. These are all dog shit. These are dog shit. You know what I mean?
[3387.18s -> 3399.21s]  Like I gotta be careful. These are not weighted to my palate moment. They're all one company.
[3399.21s -> 3408.65s]  Don't worry. That's true. True. True. That's true. All right. Laffy Taffy is actually,
[3408.65s -> 3415.08s]  holy shit. This is the pink Laffy Taffy. I'm trying to remember what it tastes like. It's like a
[3415.08s -> 3421.93s]  creamy, weird, like strawberry fake flavoring. And it's delicious. Isn't it? It's like fantastic.
[3422.57s -> 3442.92s]  I like know what this tastes like. Yeah. Hold on. I'm getting it. Hey. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's,
[3442.92s -> 3451.66s]  that's probably, oh, that's up here. I think so. Yeah. These are really good. I just haven't
[3451.66s -> 3456.10s]  had one in a while. Where's uh, like just Saltwater Taffy. That belongs up here in S.
[3459.24s -> 3464.01s]  These things are fine. They're, you eat the paper half the time. Whatever. No. Any candy where you
[3464.01s -> 3469.13s]  go like this. No, it's like, it's fine. It's, but I don't think it's, I don't, I don't want it all
[3469.13s -> 3481.82s]  the time. Uh, jelly beans. I mean, toasted marshmallow jelly beans are up here, but the
[3481.82s -> 3488.70s]  fact that they kept popcorn in for this long. I mean, they, well, you go down here like the,
[3488.70s -> 3496.15s]  just the fact that these, these people have put popcorn still in here this many years later.
[3496.15s -> 3504.10s]  What are you thinking? Like, what are you thinking? Popcorn is the best flavor. What are you thinking?
[3504.10s -> 3515.96s]  Popcorn's the best flavor. What are, what drugs I've seeped into you. Popcorn is not the best
[3515.96s -> 3525.14s]  flavor. Popcorn tastes like fucking eggs. The popcorn jelly bean tastes like eggs. No, I will,
[3525.14s -> 3535.54s]  I'm going to die on this hill. Toasted marshmallow is way up here and watermelon. So you know what,
[3535.54s -> 3541.58s]  besides like the egg flavored one, I would probably enjoy this more than Fondue or Lemonheads.
[3542.14s -> 3555.78s]  I think it's a solid B. Toasted marshmallow and sucks ass. That's like, they're literally the only
[3555.78s -> 3565.56s]  reason to get it. That's why you buy the jelly beans. What are you on about? What are you talking
[3565.56s -> 3571.13s]  about? I can't believe somebody's saying that right now. That's crazy to me. Uh, Whoppers kind
[3571.13s -> 3576.52s]  of tastes like acid. Uh, Whoppers are good, but they taste like they're fucking something's wrong
[3576.52s -> 3586.94s]  with like the something was wrong in the production. But they do have a, they have a very interesting
[3586.94s -> 3592.92s]  flavor. And if you're really into it, there's been times where I've looked at the Whoppers kind of
[3592.92s -> 3598.74s]  at the movie theater counter or whatever and been like, you know what, go, let's do it. Let's get it.
[3598.74s -> 3605.74s]  Let's go for it. And I'm like, oh yeah, these are fine. But they do, they kind of have that weird
[3605.74s -> 3611.56s]  like acidic fucking taste. Like there's something, like there was way too much of some ingredient
[3611.56s -> 3616.66s]  that you wanted to remove. But I, I think that they're fine. I would, I think they're solid.
[3616.66s -> 3625.14s]  But they, they see. I see. In fact, like these are like gimmick fucking things. They should be down
[3625.14s -> 3635.10s]  here. They're fine. They taste fine, but they're gimmicks. This is a gimmick. Who's going to be
[3635.10s -> 3639.11s]  able to do this at the office? You know what I mean? Who's, this is a gimmick. You're not,
[3639.11s -> 3650.18s]  you can't do that at the office. Like these down here, one, two, three, four, five, you can't do
[3650.18s -> 3656.06s]  this at the office. But like the guy in the next door and like the office next door, you're going
[3656.06s -> 3662.87s]  to do like pop rocks. And you look over, you peek over like the side and he's like, you can't do
[3662.87s -> 3679.08s]  that at the office. Why not? It's not for adults. I know. But I'm just saying you can't do that
[3679.08s -> 3685.48s]  at the office. We already know where Skittles are. We're going to put them both here.
[3687.26s -> 3697.27s]  Milk Duds. Oh, Milk Duds are bad. But why are these in the same space? Why are these
[3697.27s -> 3705.78s]  occupying the same part of my brain? They're like chewy and kind of hard, right? Oh, I know Milk
[3705.78s -> 3711.11s]  Duds. Milk Duds are the ones that are unbelievably delicious. The chocolate, the like candy chocolate
[3711.11s -> 3715.59s]  coating on the outside is fucking so good. It's like chewy and oh, it's so yummy. And then you
[3715.59s -> 3724.76s]  spit it out when it gets to like the weird like gum under the desk consistency. Right. Okay. I mean,
[3724.76s -> 3729.96s]  these are like A plus in flavor. But when they get to that point, they go all the way down here.
[3730.60s -> 3734.36s]  I think I'd probably rather have a whopper. The flavor is phenomenal, though. It really is.
[3734.36s -> 3748.95s]  The flavor is phenomenal. What are these dots? These are the cousin of dots. What are these
[3748.95s -> 3756.86s]  called? Like dinkels or something? What are these called? What are these gumdrops? Oh,
[3758.22s -> 3764.97s]  no, they're they're like we're dots in the same place for me. Okay, hold on.
[3765.53s -> 3772.38s]  Let me guess. Let me guess. Is it right? He sees Andy's nerds. Three musketeers. Dork pep and
[3772.38s -> 3785.14s]  patties. Snickers. Hearts. I'm gonna move this. I'm gonna move this. Yeah, I think. Wait. Yeah.
[3785.14s -> 3790.31s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's move this a little bit here. Remember these are mint. These
[3790.31s -> 3798.50s]  are mint. This is I remember this being so good. These are fine. Milky Way. Yeah, that's fine.
[3799.22s -> 3803.32s]  Put this up a little higher. Way higher, actually. Actually, you know what? Fuck that.
[3805.18s -> 3809.85s]  Oh, fuck that. Yeah, I'd rather have a youth bar. Maybe not more than a gummy bear.
[3810.49s -> 3825.24s]  Maybe not. Stupid fucking idiot. Idiot. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think that's fine. I still think he's an
[3825.24s -> 3830.04s]  alien for putting Pocky in trash tier. Actually, Pocky would be up here for me now. I've had a
[3830.04s -> 3836.73s]  few flavors that I actually really liked. There's like a mint chocolate Pocky that is up here.
[3836.73s -> 3846.50s]  I don't really like any of the other ones. Here's my old list. Okay. Pocky was on there twice.
[3847.22s -> 3856.23s]  All right. Let's get my old list. I think I'm happy with this one. What have we got?
[3863.82s -> 3875.82s]  All right. What's going on here? Who puts Mr. Goodbar in S tier? Why is Mr. Goodbar in S tier?
[3875.82s -> 3885.93s]  Mr. Goodbar? What the fuck am I talking about? Why is Mr. Goodbar on here twice? It's on here
[3885.93s -> 3897.66s]  two times. I don't get it. You were pretending it was something else. Does it remember what it was
[3897.66s -> 3905.11s]  supposed to be? Why would you ever put Mr. Goodbar in S tier? It's good, but not S tier.
[3908.78s -> 3920.23s]  Oh, this is an absolutely brainless take. Gummy bears are in D. Cadbury eggs are in D. M&M's are
[3920.23s -> 3933.53s]  in F. What am I talking about? Guys, what am I on about? Is Swedish fish down at F? It better be.
[3934.86s -> 3942.22s]  Sweet tarts? All right. Hold on. Let's shrink this down a little. Yeah. All right. Sweet tarts are
[3942.22s -> 3957.53s]  fine. Broly is in trash tier. And I would put it there again. I would put it down here again.
[3959.43s -> 3964.79s]  Everyone talking about how I have like a palette of a 10-year-old and yet I'm getting all this
[3964.79s -> 3981.78s]  flack for trolley gummy worms being down in like D. Excuse me? Gummy worms? No. Broly is S. No,
[3981.78s -> 3986.58s]  it's not. It's a gummy worm. Gummy worms are like fucking F. They're like D. I don't like them.
[3987.38s -> 3999.53s]  They're down here with like Swedish fucking fish. Wait. Hold on. I'll be fair. I'll be fair. Relax.
[4000.17s -> 4005.10s]  Relax. I'll be fair. I've never had a trolley before ever in my life.
[4005.66s -> 4008.95s]  It's just gummy worms are for kids, but I just didn't ever, I never bought them.
[4009.51s -> 4022.95s]  Eat a trolley on stream. Gummy worms were like, oh, ew. He's got a worm in his mouth that's for
[4022.95s -> 4035.53s]  children. I never bought them. Everything that I have besides nerds is an adult beverage of candies.
[4035.53s -> 4041.61s]  Okay. It's an adult beverage of candies. Reese's is like the whiskey. No. Reese's is, yeah. Reese's
[4041.61s -> 4047.78s]  is like the whiskey. Andy's is like the, like peppermint schnapps. Free Musketeers is like a
[4047.78s -> 4054.18s]  really good fucking wine. York peppermint patty. These are, these are, these are like adult beverages.
[4056.68s -> 4064.06s]  Snickers bar. Oh, that's like, these are, these are like aged to perfection. Everyone making fun
[4064.06s -> 4069.10s]  of my, my 10 year old palette and saying, where's trolley? Where's the gummy worms?
[4070.41s -> 4077.27s]  Bubble tape. It's six feet of bubble gum for adults, not kids. I remember the commercial.
[4078.15s -> 4085.82s]  Six feet of bubble gum for you, not kids. I saw it a million times. It was on TV all the time.
[4085.82s -> 4090.89s]  You're already in mine. Okay. I've never had a trolley. I'll leave the trolley on stream
[4092.04s -> 4100.63s]  and I'll change my opinion if it's good. Gummy worms are for men. What? It's not for men? No,
[4100.63s -> 4118.82s]  it's not. Why? How's a gummy worm for men? Oh, it's a man sized gummy worm. Gummy worms are for men.
[4119.54s -> 4125.38s]  Why are you putting gummy worms in the same category as, as like a fucking like brisket sandwich?
[4131.74s -> 4140.31s]  Executives eat trolley. Really? At the office? Really? At the, at the office?
[4141.67s -> 4148.44s]  Trolley gummy worms coming out at the office? Really? No, it is coming out. Andy's mints. Andy's
[4148.44s -> 4156.60s]  mints. York peppermint patties. Son, would you like a Snickers? Son, how about a three musketeers?
[4156.60s -> 4161.10s]  That's coming out of the board meeting. Nobody at the board meeting is, unless it's like one of
[4161.10s -> 4165.74s]  those like 90s comedy movies where like the kind of weird funny guy got on the board of directors
[4165.74s -> 4170.62s]  and like comes to the office in like a, like a sweatshirt and like glasses and eats gummy worms.
[4170.62s -> 4180.86s]  All right. This is not a 90s comedy movie. We're executives and we eat Andy's mints.
[4181.02s -> 4193.24s]  CEOs eat trolley. Oh no, they do not. You're a boring adult. Okay, here we go. I will buy a
[4193.24s -> 4199.77s]  bag of trolley and I'll eat them on stream. Is there a certain color of trolley that I need to eat
[4199.77s -> 4203.93s]  first? Or is it one of those cases where like, no dude, skip all the green ones and yeah, those
[4203.93s -> 4210.86s]  are the gross ones. Which, what, which is the one I need to eat? Blue? Make this, you better make
[4210.86s -> 4220.04s]  this accurate because you're only getting one chance. Sour trolley? Blue sour trolley. The blue
[4220.04s -> 4225.48s]  and pink blue and sour trolley. Blue and blue and pink trolley. Sour. Blue and pink sour trolley.
[4225.48s -> 4238.20s]  Okay. All right. Any, any of the blue ones, any of the red ones. Pink. Sour. Okay. Sure. I'm going to
[4238.20s -> 4245.26s]  eat a blue sour trolley on stream tomorrow. Tomorrow. We'll do it tomorrow. Any other candies
[4245.26s -> 4253.24s]  that I have to have to be a fucking adult? Which ones? I'll give you my real opinion. Tomorrow.
[4259.16s -> 4266.18s]  Can you eat, can you eat a review of Papa John's pizza? I'm not going to eat a fucking trolley and
[4266.18s -> 4272.81s]  then a Papa John's pizza tomorrow. Why would I do that? Oh, hey dude, now that you're trying candy,
[4272.81s -> 4291.02s]  eat a whole Papa John's pepperoni pizza and give us what you thought. Okay. How about this? No,
[4291.02s -> 4295.86s]  that's, I don't think I can get that by tomorrow. Should I like go up against my own bullshit and
[4295.86s -> 4302.82s]  eat all the things that are in like D, like C and D? Should we do like a face your bullshit stream
[4304.07s -> 4308.23s]  where like I eat all these things that I have in a bad category and tell you how I really feel?
[4312.62s -> 4324.47s]  And you have to eat them in a suit. Toblerone is S plus. It's not, it can't even fit on this list.
[4324.47s -> 4329.11s]  Toblerone is like stratosphere. It's the best candy in the world, but it's just not on here.
[4329.11s -> 4334.01s]  It's not fair. It's not fair for Toblerone to be on here. All right. How about this? Let's,
[4334.01s -> 4338.49s]  okay. This is what we're going to do. We're going to do a face the bullshit stream.
[4339.29s -> 4353.48s]  Can I do it tomorrow? Tomorrow. Okay. Can I, can you give me a day to prepare? I want to make sure
[4353.48s -> 4359.72s]  I can like get a bunch of these. I'll do a face the bullshit stream. Let me, give me a little,
[4359.72s -> 4367.77s]  give me a day or two to prepare this. Thursday. I think I can get most of these by Thursday.
[4367.77s -> 4378.95s]  I don't think I can get it by tomorrow. I'll wear a suit and it will, it'll be called face the
[4378.95s -> 4384.84s]  bullshit stream. I'm talking like all the, all like the F tier shit that I've told you about.
[4385.40s -> 4389.18s]  We're talking bread? Like I'm going to get wheat bread. Like you know what, what we should do?
[4389.74s -> 4393.26s]  Let me, I'm going to go through these and figure out all the, all the things that I fucking said
[4393.26s -> 4400.36s]  it would do a gross. You're going to buy every single candy at the store in a suit.
[4404.44s -> 4408.76s]  Did they make little versions of this shit? I don't want to like eat one and then like not want it.
[4408.76s -> 4417.77s]  You need a popcorn jelly bean. Oh fuck. You can get 95% of these at like Walmart or a gas station.
[4417.77s -> 4432.66s]  Okay. All right. All right. We'll, we'll make this work. So I'm, tomorrow I'm going to scour the world
[4432.66s -> 4437.22s]  for all these things that I said that I hate or think is gross or think like I, I'm so high and
[4437.22s -> 4443.45s]  mighty on and I will give you my real honest opinions on them. I will not fuck around.
[4443.45s -> 4447.26s]  I'm going to, and I'm going to do it in a suit. It's going to be like a fucking telephone on the
[4447.26s -> 4464.46s]  desk. I'm going to have like an executive table. All I ask is that you don't fuck around. All right.
[4464.46s -> 4470.36s]  I'll pull up all, I get, I'll figure it out. But yeah, we'll, we'll open up. If you have any
[4470.36s -> 4475.91s]  recommendations, by the way, we have the recommended channel in discord. Maybe I can work with maybe the
[4475.91s -> 4482.97s]  mods. We'll, we'll get like a good list of like a bunch of stuff. This is going to be the worst
[4482.97s -> 4498.84s]  stream of the year with candlelight. What if he pukes? What if I puke on camera? Can I puke?
[4502.33s -> 4511.21s]  Yeah. It's going to be called face the bullshit and a top hat with candles. All right. Let me
[4511.21s -> 4522.62s]  just make sure I can even get all this gross stuff. Okay. I'll see you. I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[4522.62s -> 4532.23s]  Thursday. We're going to start early on Thursday, not four o'clock. We're going to start Thursday,
[4532.23s -> 4539.93s]  probably around like two. You said tomorrow. I got to go. Okay. I don't think I can find
[4542.49s -> 4547.61s]  some of these things on the chips list guys. I'm going to have to go to like fucking five
[4547.61s -> 4552.94s]  Walmarts. That's not going to happen tomorrow. All the, okay. If he wants to get the F's from
[4552.94s -> 4559.40s]  his chip list, I'll do them all. All my tier lists. Maybe besides the fast food ones. Cause
[4559.40s -> 4562.65s]  that I don't want to like, all right. Here's what I don't want to do. I don't want to like
[4562.65s -> 4567.35s]  buy a bunch of food and like waste a bunch of food. Right. That'll be for like a different day.
[4567.35s -> 4572.30s]  And maybe we're talking like shelf stable stuff because even if I don't like it, I can like
[4572.30s -> 4576.86s]  roll it up and like eat it over the course of a year. So I, I'm not going to buy like
[4576.86s -> 4581.90s]  fucking 30 pieces of fast food and take 10 bites of everything and then throw it all away. I'm
[4581.90s -> 4591.80s]  not going to do that. So we'll see. I'll do it on Thursday. Do it on Friday. I can't do it on
[4591.80s -> 4598.70s]  Friday. Cause I need to get like all these candies. I need to get all those chips. I need to get all
[4598.70s -> 4611.00s]  the sodas and hey, where's the, where's the Pepsi nitro? Where's Pepsi nitro? Where's Pepsi nitro?
[4611.08s -> 4616.60s]  Where the fuck is it? I keep seeing commercials for it. Where is it? Where is it? They keep showing
[4616.60s -> 4628.71s]  it to me. Where is it? It's bad. I want to try it. I keep seeing it on like television and shit.
[4628.71s -> 4638.92s]  And I'm like, I want it. I want to try it. It's so good. It actually looked good. All right.
[4640.20s -> 4643.08s]  Those of you that want to follow the sort of what's going to happen here,
[4643.88s -> 4650.36s]  all the F tier candies and like maybe some of the D tier candies, all the F tier sodas,
[4650.36s -> 4655.26s]  all the F tier chips. I'm going to try to get as many of them as I can. Here we go. And I'm
[4655.26s -> 4662.58s]  going to give you, I'm going to give a rating out of 10. That's it. I'll see you. I'll see you
[4662.58s -> 4671.88s]  Thursday. And don't forget breads. Don't worry. That's why it's going to take more than, okay.
[4671.88s -> 4676.01s]  That's why it's going to take more than like a day. I have to go to like a bunch. I have to like,
[4676.57s -> 4682.17s]  I don't think they have all this stuff in one place. Who the fuck has candy corn right now?
[4682.17s -> 4687.69s]  Or candy cigarettes? I don't know. Are these even legal anymore? Are these, these are illegal?
[4687.85s -> 4693.54s]  Aren't they? I don't think I can buy these. We're going to get these. We're supposed to get that.
[4695.14s -> 4704.33s]  Cookie dough bites. Guys, they don't even sell this. You have to go to Spencer's Gifts.
[4707.54s -> 4714.86s]  Spencer's. Just go to a movie theater. Oh my God. I'm going to go to a movie theater and just
[4714.86s -> 4719.42s]  be like, I'll take, I'll take the Almond Joy. I'll take the Twizzlers. I'll take the Mike and Ikes.

[4723.18s -> 4728.14s]  and the Peeps. Uh, give me a couple of those too. Oh, enjoy the movie. No, there's no movie.
[4728.86s -> 4743.99s]  Bye. Bye, man. Enjoy Spider-Man. That movie sucked. See you later. It did, I'm kidding.
[4744.63s -> 4750.18s]  That didn't suck. It was fine. Oh, enjoy Morbius. Oh, dude, it's the fifth time I've seen it.
[4752.58s -> 4755.22s]  All right, I'll see you later. I'm going to work on, I'm going to get to work on this now.

[4770.73s -> 4778.14s]  They're saying get some, get what you can reasonably get. Cereal list too. Yep. I have so much
[4778.14s -> 4783.18s]  bullshit. I'm going to have a pantry full of shit. I'm never going to have to buy a cereal ever. But
[4783.18s -> 4790.70s]  what if I don't like it? I'm going to have to like eat like gross cereal. I mean, I'm going to eat all
[4790.70s -> 4795.90s]  this stuff because it's going to be, I don't want to just waste a bunch of food. So if I buy, for
[4795.90s -> 4803.75s]  instance, um, what is down here at the very bottom? Like multi-grain Cheerios. Oh, I don't want to eat
[4803.75s -> 4819.13s]  those, but I don't want to eat multi-grain Cheerios. Could you donate it? Okay. If I don't get through
[4819.13s -> 4826.76s]  everything and yeah, but I mean, I'm going to be opening most of this stuff. I'm going to have to
[4826.76s -> 4837.11s]  eat it. So if I, if I can track down the Sour Patch Kids cereal, I'm going to have to open the bag and
[4837.11s -> 4842.84s]  eat it. I can't like, I'm not going to, I'm going to have to eventually over the course of like a year
[4842.84s -> 4849.53s]  eat that Sour Patch Kids cereal. They're a single serving box. Yeah. I'll make sure to get the small
[4849.53s -> 4872.57s]  ones. All right. So I'll see you on Thursday for Face the Bullshit 2 p.m. Might start earlier.
