[2293.56s -> 2296.33s]  I feel like shit
[2296.33s -> 2300.73s]  I hope that when you make these choices that you do them in a way that it can succeed all of us
[2302.60s -> 2304.60s]  I think I need to fucking lie down
[2308.90s -> 2311.46s]  Um, what was I saying?

[8716.69s -> 8723.74s]  I'm not going through the window that hurt even if I wanted to move this it would be hard for one person
[8729.71s -> 8738.99s]  I don't know what to do. I need to get in there

[8833.92s -> 8835.39s]  No
[8835.39s -> 8837.55s]  This is kind of fun what i'm doing, but not really

[8848.08s -> 8849.84s]  It's not going to be that
[8849.84s -> 8851.84s]  I i'm not going to use this as a toilet seat
[8852.08s -> 8855.50s]  Oh, this is kind of funny hat. This is a funny hat. I like it
[8856.30s -> 8863.14s]  This is a funny hat
[8863.38s -> 8868.10s]  I can't even block the door. I could very easily just get in there. I could
[8869.42s -> 8873.94s]  but
[8873.94s -> 8876.69s]  Make food I can't
[8879.87s -> 8881.81s]  um
[8881.81s -> 8884.53s]  Just see what if I can I eat these these flowers edible?
[8885.33s -> 8892.14s]  I don't think I can even tight. Can I at least can I eat one of these?
[8892.94s -> 8895.74s]  What happens to my to my uh hunger level if I eat one of these?
[8896.38s -> 8905.63s]  Hold on. Let me see

[8909.38s -> 8912.24s]  All right. What if I take like a bite?
[8912.24s -> 8924.29s]  I'll take a big bite
[8924.29s -> 8929.90s]  It's not good
[8929.90s -> 8932.46s]  I I can't go. All right. I'm climbing the window again
[8933.65s -> 8935.81s]  No, I don't want to climb in the window because then I won't get the comfortable bed
[8947.06s -> 8950.82s]  No, it's I I got I don't want to get hurt. This is day one
[8954.19s -> 8956.96s]  Oh shit
[8956.96s -> 8958.96s]  But these have been out here for like five days
[8960.58s -> 8962.66s]  Haven't these been out here for like at least five days, right?
[8963.38s -> 8972.85s]  Can I actually eat these or is that gonna be bad for like what if I just pretend to
[8976.70s -> 8978.70s]  I don't know how long these actually have been here for
[8983.09s -> 8987.63s]  Now i've had another bite
[8987.63s -> 8990.90s]  Oh, that was really good
[8993.76s -> 8995.76s]  I want to just like jump in
[9006.72s -> 9009.78s]  What?
[9009.78s -> 9011.46s]  What are you doing?
[9011.46s -> 9014.74s]  You want me to run run run away
[9017.58s -> 9019.58s]  Like now you want me to run away
[9023.36s -> 9029.74s]  That that's
[9029.74s -> 9271.36s]  I can run down the street. I can't get back inside
[9272.66s -> 9276.30s]  That's very obvious. This is a nice house
[9279.26s -> 9281.36s]  How am I going to get back in here run away?
[9281.36s -> 9283.52s]  I've been walking around the neighborhood for the last like six hours
[9285.01s -> 9287.81s]  You know people have come out and just looked at me and been like what the hell is this guy doing out here?
[9290.32s -> 9292.48s]  Seems you have chosen to upgrade the house
[9294.86s -> 9297.15s]  Uh, and what does that mean?
[9297.15s -> 9299.73s]  Uh, that means that that is the end of the tutorial
[9301.26s -> 9302.30s]  so
[9302.30s -> 9307.34s]  Thank you for playing in our tutorial version of this game. Hopefully it worked out pretty well. I think it did
[9308.30s -> 9310.30s]  uh and in
[9311.17s -> 9313.30s]  Two days
[9313.30s -> 9315.30s]  That is where the real game starts
[9316.02s -> 9316.98s]  so
[9316.98s -> 9322.90s]  I this was a ton of fun. Let me look at the right camera right here. Here we are. I had a ton of fun
[9323.30s -> 9326.66s]  Thanks for watching everybody special huge huge huge scam
[9329.46s -> 9333.22s]  Well, I want to say thanks everybody watching we have two more streams of this
[9334.10s -> 9336.10s]  And it's going to get even more wild
[9336.42s -> 9340.10s]  Uh, I we're literally going to dial it even higher and higher every day
[9341.47s -> 9344.27s]  Uh, so i'm keep talking to the wrong cameras. I don't know what's wrong with
[9345.15s -> 9349.31s]  We're going to dial it up every day every single day. It's going to get more ridiculous
[9350.03s -> 9354.35s]  So we want to make sure that everything worked as intended before we got started
[9354.91s -> 9356.03s]  so
[9356.03s -> 9359.39s]  I cannot actually get into this house. So i'm not going to even try
[9360.03s -> 9363.15s]  uh trial version of full game unlocked
[9364.19s -> 9368.35s]  Special huge. Thank you to twitch for partnering with us and a coinbase
[9369.62s -> 9374.50s]  Without them this would never have happened and there's way more to see over the next two or three days
[9375.14s -> 9379.78s]  So what that means you'll see in the next few days, but we we got everything
[9380.34s -> 9383.39s]  What was that?
[9383.39s -> 9387.71s]  You paid to end the stream you paid to end the tutorial is what you did
[9388.98s -> 9391.54s]  Uh, but yeah, i'm really really happy
[9391.62s -> 9397.14s]  I really think that everything worked out pretty well in this kind of tutorial version of the game. So i'm very very excited
[9397.78s -> 9399.06s]  I hope you had fun
[9399.06s -> 9400.34s]  We got a lot of data
[9400.34s -> 9404.18s]  So we got a lot of things that we might have to work on and check out and see how they played out
[9404.18s -> 9407.30s]  But uh for the most part, I think it was pretty fun
[9408.02s -> 9410.46s]  So we'll see
[9410.46s -> 9413.02s]  So we'll see with the upgraded house in a couple of days
[9414.40s -> 9417.04s]  With even more wacky wild stuff
[9419.41s -> 9422.69s]  Thank you everybody. We'll see in a couple days. Thanks for playing the tutorial
[9424.24s -> 9426.56s]  I can't go back in there
[9426.56s -> 9430.16s]  Huge shout out to twitch huge shout out to coinbase for letting us do this shit
[9431.12s -> 9433.12s]  Huge thanks without them. It's impossible
[9436.10s -> 9438.10s]  We'll see full days
