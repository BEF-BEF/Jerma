[2.68s -> 8.23s]  Ah dude, I just ripped out every single cord that was plugged into my computer.
[8.23s -> 11.99s]  I'm not even kidding. I don't know what the hell that was. What was that all about?
[13.88s -> 19.18s]  I'm sitting here completely normal. Like there was nothing wrong and all of a sudden I look
[19.18s -> 27.74s]  over and I clicked on the start menu and it was just just scrolling. I wasn't scrolling.
[28.38s -> 34.04s]  I unplugged my fucking mouse, my keyboard and I opened up Binding of Isaac and it was on two
[34.04s -> 42.78s]  monitors and the other monitor was going. What? I've been using this computer since I left.
[47.37s -> 60.89s]  What was that for? Oh my god. Anyways, hello. How are you? Good to see you again. Hope you're
[60.89s -> 72.76s]  doing well. I have returned from my absence and what do we have? We have a lot of things to talk
[72.76s -> 80.01s]  about. This is, this is a lot. Some of these things are really good. Some of these things I
[80.01s -> 91.96s]  do. Hold on. Let me just open up my thing. Ah, global power raid. Oops. Okay. Well, don't
[91.96s -> 95.72s]  monkey ass yet. You don't know what we're talking about. Shit. Can I move this mic? Hold on.
[114.60s -> 122.62s]  Is, am I delayed? What do I have for a delay? Let me change that. It's been a while.
[129.08s -> 134.98s]  All right. No, I got no delay. I'm good. Okay. So the first thing I'm going to talk about
[135.70s -> 142.68s]  now, where do you start? I have to, okay. I have a book report right now. I'm up in the front of the
[142.68s -> 149.32s]  class about to present my book report and it's different. You're all teachers. I'm one student.
[149.32s -> 155.75s]  You're all teachers. All of you. I got selected to do my book report in front of like the teachers
[155.75s -> 162.79s]  union because it was, it was so good. And I'm up here like, okay. Um, where do I start? George
[162.79s -> 171.72s]  Washington had wood teeth and he, uh, okay. So let's start. Why not? But how do I, what,
[171.72s -> 186.92s]  what should I put on in the background? Don't ask me here. Oh, I get an F. We're on do OST.
[188.38s -> 193.69s]  Now let's like, hold on. Oh, we're going to play Binding of Isaac because, uh,
[193.69s -> 198.71s]  holy shit. Repentance is out. That's very surprising. That's really cool.
[199.96s -> 207.24s]  Oh, hold on. Unrecognized game pad. Don't do this again. Oh God. The project, the projector
[207.24s -> 212.78s]  isn't working. I have my image that I got of the first image search of George Washington's on the
[212.78s -> 218.22s]  fucking projector and it's glitching out on me. George Washington. Okay. There we go.
[219.18s -> 230.42s]  Camera's not on, right? There we go. So, uh, what do I want to put here? Everything's going to be okay.
[231.54s -> 235.46s]  You're the one teacher in the back that realizes that I have like a lot going on. I got a lot to
[235.46s -> 244.87s]  talk about. Son, everything's going to be just fine. And I'm like, Oh, yeah, it is going to be
[244.87s -> 252.18s]  just fine. Thanks, Mr. Davidson. Mr. Davidson reaches in his pocket. He's got like a big flask
[252.18s -> 266.89s]  and he just like. All right. So let's just get started. I gave you a PR press release before.
[266.89s -> 269.85s]  Those of you that read it, here's what we have. Here's what we're going to start right here.
[270.97s -> 277.96s]  As of today, I'm going to go over the medical stuff. So medically speaking, the reason why I
[278.44s -> 281.72s]  have been gone for so long and the reason why I was gone a while back too is to take
[282.90s -> 292.36s]  my pain problem really seriously. And I've started to. I went in, I had six injections into my spine.
[292.36s -> 297.32s]  Well, not my spine. That's a lie. Into my like spinal muscles. It was like not even real.
[302.02s -> 307.53s]  I had six injections into the muscles around my spine. They're called trigger point injections.
[308.76s -> 311.48s]  They're supposed to alleviate some of the tension that I've been having
[312.36s -> 316.04s]  in my chest and back that could be radiating. I could have trigger point problems. I could have
[316.04s -> 320.92s]  myofascial pain syndrome. I could have costochondritis. I could have a hernia problem.
[320.92s -> 326.46s]  I could have. The list goes on. This has been going on for three years. Those of you that aren't
[326.46s -> 333.29s]  aware of this. So I did those and they helped a little bit, but it didn't fix the problem.
[333.29s -> 341.06s]  The problem's still there. It hasn't gone away. It might never go away from what I've potentially
[341.06s -> 349.10s]  been told. So what I have to end up doing now is start to really seriously treat this dead serious
[349.10s -> 356.18s]  priority number one. And I want to do that without having to stop streaming because I don't want to
[356.18s -> 361.59s]  just stop streaming. I've taken like these month-long breaks or these like, oh I'll be back in like three
[361.59s -> 367.35s]  months. It sucks. I don't want to do that. Obviously because I don't want to just disappear.
[368.06s -> 373.90s]  But I kind of have to do what I have to do. And on top of that, there's been some things going on
[373.90s -> 379.56s]  with my family too that I need to really pay attention to. So they're kind of just jumping
[379.56s -> 388.44s]  on top of each other. And I need to make the decision essentially to dial back streaming.
[388.44s -> 394.23s]  And like dial back my presence on the internet, I guess you could say. I don't take this decision
[394.23s -> 397.99s]  lightly. This is not something I'm like really, oh I can't wait to like only stream once a week.
[398.78s -> 407.35s]  But I have to really start to take this dead seriously. And if I can continue to stream once
[407.35s -> 411.96s]  a week or so, or maybe once or twice a week depending on what we're doing, I don't want to,
[411.96s -> 418.10s]  I won't have to take these monster breaks. I can focus on going to maybe more intense physical
[418.10s -> 423.96s]  therapy to try to work this out. Do more procedures. Get this stuff done and some of the
[423.96s -> 428.14s]  other stuff going on in my personal life too without having to do like a three month break.
[428.14s -> 433.56s]  And I think that's going to stay for a while. So this is not something that's going to be here for
[433.64s -> 441.78s]  a couple weeks or like a month. I think this might be a potentially permanent change to stream only
[441.78s -> 448.17s]  once or twice a week. And I mean, I've been doing this for like 10 years to let you know.
[448.17s -> 452.10s]  And if I have to change things to be able to do it the way that I know I can, the way that I'm
[452.10s -> 458.68s]  comfortable doing it, then I'm going to do that. I have to. If I wasn't going to make these changes,
[459.24s -> 465.06s]  then I don't know if I would continue to be able to like want to stream if I'm serious.
[465.06s -> 468.34s]  Having to like have my brain in like three or four different places and like come on and do
[468.34s -> 473.83s]  streams and stuff. It's just, it's something I don't think is going to happen. He's done. No,
[473.83s -> 481.72s]  I'm not done. I'm not done. I'm not retiring. This is not a, I'm retiring stream. I'm not,
[481.72s -> 487.56s]  my career is not over. All right. It just got started. It's just getting, my career is just
[487.56s -> 492.89s]  getting started. It says the guy in like the dirty overcoat that's like running around outside
[492.89s -> 499.08s]  yelling at like popular streamers. You're right. My career just got started. And I reach in and
[499.08s -> 504.09s]  grab the flask and I'm like, you know, who the fuck's that weird guy over there? He keeps like
[504.09s -> 510.33s]  running up and yelling at us. I think that's, that's German985. I've heard of him before.
[510.33s -> 524.38s]  Yeah, you better have. I'll always remember you. The plan is to not have to do that. You understand?
[524.38s -> 530.28s]  The plan here is take some of the stuff going on in my life really fucking seriously and
[530.28s -> 535.46s]  continue to do the thing I like to do, which is this. And I know people are going to be concerned
[535.46s -> 540.78s]  here. I know they are about money. Oh my God. If you, if you, if you stop streaming, if you only
[540.78s -> 544.94s]  stream like once a week or once in a while, what about all the subs? What about all the money?
[546.22s -> 551.26s]  I never cared about that in the first place. If I did, you would have probably known that by now.
[552.89s -> 560.06s]  Dropping like subs or losing like viewers or something. This channel has done so,
[561.16s -> 566.34s]  like the view counts have been so ridiculous over the last year. The amount of people,
[566.34s -> 572.66s]  the new people, the new community that this has kind of generated, it's overwhelming at times.
[572.66s -> 579.99s]  But I was never in the game of trying to kind of min max my Twitch stats. I don't,
[579.99s -> 585.91s]  that doesn't do it for me. I want to continue to have fun here and enjoy what I'm doing. And
[585.91s -> 590.49s]  recently, it's very obvious. I can't like lie to you guys. What am I going to pretend like this
[590.49s -> 596.65s]  has not been a problem? The last year or two, you've probably been very aware that it kind of like
[596.65s -> 602.07s]  hurts to like exist. Like my back and spine and chest, you've seen me with like the brace on.
[602.07s -> 607.21s]  You've seen me wearing like the boomer brace and the chest piece. And oh, I only stream for like a
[607.21s -> 613.43s]  few hours at a time. Get a standing desk. Oh, but even standing is kind of a pain in the ass too.
[613.43s -> 616.97s]  This is something that just hasn't gone away. I've been to the doctor a bunch of times. We're
[616.97s -> 620.89s]  trying to figure out what exactly could it be. Is this something that's so simple and so easy,
[620.89s -> 633.78s]  but nobody has fixed it yet? I don't know. But it's, I can't, I'm not gonna lie. So boomer pog.
[633.78s -> 642.12s]  And don't, I also don't want anybody to twist this either. I'm okay. I'm not, this is not a problem
[642.12s -> 648.57s]  that is necessarily like ruining my life. It's just something that's constantly there,
[648.57s -> 654.42s]  that constantly has to stay in the front of my brain. So while I'm doing anything,
[654.42s -> 658.90s]  half of my brain is like, hey, your chest hurts. And it's like, all right, well, fuck off,
[658.90s -> 663.24s]  shut up, leave me alone. And the other half is like, hey, you're doing this thing. And especially
[663.24s -> 668.20s]  with the increased activity that I've been doing recently, obviously it gets a little nicer.
[668.20s -> 673.16s]  And obviously if COVID starts to get more under control, there's going to be a lot of shit going
[673.16s -> 681.82s]  on here over the next four or five, six months stream wise. So I, I kind of have to be able to
[681.82s -> 686.94s]  do these things without having it be a problem. So I'm trying desperately over these next six to
[686.94s -> 694.50s]  12 months to really, really focus on it. And to lead into that, why don't we talk about something
[694.50s -> 699.46s]  else? Why don't we go from like, oh, once a week Andy, and now that's, oh no, he's retiring to,
[701.08s -> 708.14s]  hey, are you ready? Hey, what's he gonna say? What am I going to say?
[709.13s -> 718.74s]  What's the announcement? The announcement. Oh, I'm going to milk this shit out of this one.
[718.74s -> 728.74s]  Grotto Beasts is real. It's going to be a real collectible trading card game that you will be
[728.74s -> 741.42s]  able to buy. It's real. I have had to keep my fucking mouth shut about this for a while. I want
[741.42s -> 746.94s]  to kind of start to build some attention to it because eventually here, probably fairly soon,
[746.94s -> 754.23s]  you're going to be able to buy your own Grotto Beasts packs. And what does that, you will wait,
[754.23s -> 761.03s]  we'll give you more details when that is, you know, more in the front of the brain, right? Of
[761.03s -> 769.54s]  course it was real. It was made 40 years ago. Yeah. But it's real in the sense of this channel.
[769.54s -> 783.29s]  I cannot wait to show you more details of what that is. You're doing NFTs. No, cards. Like you
[783.29s -> 788.18s]  could get them in your hand, physical card packs. What did I miss in the last 30 seconds? Somebody
[788.18s -> 795.64s]  update that guy. Grotto Beasts is real. It's a real card pack opening game. Physical. We're
[795.64s -> 801.51s]  not talking digital. We're talking physical cards. Coming soon. And going to be probably
[801.51s -> 814.89s]  doing merch too. Grotto Beasts merch. I'm going to wear this shit on stream. Razzle Puss real.
[814.89s -> 825.06s]  Finally, merch. Well, I only do merch when it makes sense. And this makes sense. Sellout streamer.
[828.10s -> 834.20s]  Oh, I get it. Let me lean in and put my hand up to my mouth and lean in. I get it. He's only
[834.20s -> 839.99s]  streaming once a week and he's going to milk the fuck out of us for all of our money. Grotto Beasts
[839.99s -> 849.61s]  merchandise once a week, Andy. Fuck this guy. Omega-Lel True. No, no. We'll see. We'll see how
[849.61s -> 858.04s]  cool it is. It seems like it's going to be really fun. Take it all. But that's big announcement
[858.04s -> 864.04s]  number one. There you are. Now, the next thing I'm going to say is not necessarily an announcement
[864.04s -> 869.78s]  as much as something really cool. When I was originally going to come back, I was going to
[869.78s -> 877.75s]  show something that we're going to watch together right now. It is a video. This video. You know
[877.75s -> 884.79s]  what? I don't think I'm even going to say anything about it. We're going to watch it right now. Are
[884.79s -> 893.88s]  you ready? Are you ready for the premiere of the Rat Movie? Rat Movie premiere? What does that
[893.88s -> 906.84s]  mean? I thought you already did the Rat Movie like a long time ago. Bionicle. And joining me now,
[907.91s -> 923.24s]  Joe Biden. Go. Go. You're there. I lost him. He's not on the line anymore. Oh, shoot. He was just
[923.24s -> 930.44s]  on the phone. Kidding. Not real. That didn't happen. That's a fucking lie. Don't you guys
[930.84s -> 936.28s]  remember? I forget how to stream. I forget how to be a live streamer when I take three weeks off,
[936.28s -> 942.42s]  a month off. I'm just sitting here talking fucking nonsense. All right. You ready? Let's go ahead
[942.42s -> 950.52s]  and watch it. This is the Rat Movie. But unlike you probably have seen so far, a lot of work went
[950.52s -> 955.74s]  into this. A lot of people had a lot to do with this. Let's just go ahead and watch it. No more
[955.74s -> 979.19s]  stalling. Here we go. No more stalling, I promise. Just one more second. One more minute. What is
[979.19s -> 989.62s]  this? This is not it. This is a fucking ad. This is a Liberty Mutual ad. It's not a huge announcement
[989.62s -> 997.56s]  of Liberty Mutual. Oh, this game rules. How come I can't hear it? Wait, why can I not hear this?
[998.20s -> 1007.00s]  Johnny on the spot air conditioning in his face. Where's the movie?
[1008.86s -> 1021.13s]  Where's the movie? Hold on. I gotta turn off Isaac. On the spot air conditioning. Wait,
[1021.13s -> 1028.22s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. Isaac is still playing. I'm really bad at this.
[1032.22s -> 1044.38s]  Okay. Are we ready? We are ready. I'm ready now. All right. In three, two, one. Rat Movie
[1044.38s -> 1060.84s]  Reanimated Collab. We're the rats. We're the rats. We pray at night. We stalk at night.
[1060.84s -> 1069.24s]  We're the rats. Fuck off. I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules. Let's see what kind of
[1069.24s -> 1077.16s]  trouble we can get ourselves into. So sue me for being thorough. I want to know that you know what
[1077.16s -> 1082.60s]  the plan is. Look, seriously, mate, how many artifacts do we need to steal before you trust
[1082.60s -> 1086.12s]  me with these jobs? Well, I just want to make sure you know what's happening. We're going to
[1086.12s -> 1092.68s]  get the treasure. We're going to get out of there and we also have to sell it. We must get it.
[1092.68s -> 1099.13s]  That's the most important thing. So be on your A game. We go now. I got to drive the car today
[1099.13s -> 1102.97s]  because it's my birthday. No, don't let him get in the car. Please don't let him. Come on.
[1103.93s -> 1109.37s]  He's driving. Whatever. Bloody hell. Oi, more importantly, since when did we have a rat problem?
[1109.37s -> 1116.82s]  We don't. Get in. Let's go. Speed it up. Yeah, that's the speed I'm looking for. That's the type
[1116.82s -> 1123.56s]  of fastness I want. I don't even know where you're going at this point. We've been driving all night.
[1123.56s -> 1129.90s]  It's my birthday. Hey, you, you're just, you're running over a guy right now. Are you fucking
[1129.90s -> 1142.95s]  serious? Mommy, next time we do this, I'll get my nan to drive. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, you over the
[1142.95s -> 1147.11s]  dancing. It's actually $10 to dance in this building. You're going to have to give me some
[1147.11s -> 1153.27s]  money. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, may I have the attention of the class? My name is
[1153.27s -> 1158.79s]  Dick Dastardly Richard and I'm here to take the treasure chest that's in the back room. Go get it,
[1158.79s -> 1165.19s]  boys. I'll follow you in. And let me tell you something, clerk. If you as so as move a muscle,
[1165.75s -> 1176.58s]  I'll make sure you stay buried in that ground there. All right, let's go. All right. Give me,
[1176.58s -> 1179.70s]  give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me. Is the treasure in there? Is it in there?
[1179.70s -> 1186.02s]  Yeah, it's all here. Oh, yes. Now that's what I like to hear. And now we are invincible.
[1186.74s -> 1194.34s]  Not so fast. You stand before Gerard, guardian of the treasure chest of the Mayan temple.
[1194.34s -> 1200.50s]  And I will make sure to grab it. Hey. Oh, fuck this. I'm off. Hey, what are you doing?
[1201.30s -> 1208.42s]  Hey, we're the rats. We play at night. We stalk at night. We're the rats. All right. Yeah,
[1208.42s -> 1212.82s]  that's cool. Yeah, I like rats. Nothing bad with rats. But let me tell you something,
[1212.82s -> 1219.70s]  over my dead body are you getting this treasure? Rats, rats, rats, rats, rats, rats. Look at that
[1219.70s -> 1225.62s]  flock of birds over there. That reminds me of my favorite movie, The Movie. Is that's your
[1225.62s -> 1231.62s]  favorite movie too, right? Yo, my favorite movie is Frozen. I like Elsa and Anna. Okay. Now I kill
[1231.62s -> 1241.72s]  you. Wow. That's great pick choice for favorite is movie. I wonder if I have to think that now.
[1241.72s -> 1247.61s]  Now I get to be the giant rat. Cool. Surprise. So you're trying to tell me that inside of this
[1247.61s -> 1252.41s]  building right here, there was a giant rat among other things, the giant pickles. Did he say
[1252.41s -> 1256.97s]  pickles? Or am I putting that in there by myself? Whatever. Sergeant Pickles is going to go in here
[1256.97s -> 1260.97s]  check it out. We're going to make sure everything's okay. And give me some candy corn too. That's a
[1260.97s -> 1264.89s]  weird request. I know, but just get it. You guys are going to drop it. We're going to be in big
[1264.89s -> 1273.38s]  trouble. So quit pressing around. I hear somebody coming. Hello, sir. Welcome to the rat cafe.
[1273.38s -> 1279.06s]  There's no rats here. It's just hamburgers. That would be real nice if that were true.
[1279.70s -> 1286.82s]  Except it isn't. You're a rat, aren't you? No, no. Why would that happen? That's not us. We're just
[1287.54s -> 1291.94s]  people. And I'm going to be taking you in. And wouldn't it be funny if this were real?
[1292.50s -> 1296.02s]  I'm just kidding. Be careful though. There's apparently a giant rat around.
[1296.58s -> 1305.40s]  You have a good day, officer. So you figure anything out in there? Nice clean. It's back to
[1305.40s -> 1309.64s]  the drawing board. Well, that's great. I don't know how to draw, so you're going to have to do
[1309.64s -> 1326.86s]  the drawing. Sergeant Scritchy Scratch of the Cat Police reporting in. You are now relieved of your
[1326.86s -> 1334.70s]  duty. Thank you for your continued work. Thank you. Your duty will not go unnoticed.
[1336.30s -> 1341.18s]  What's that on you? What? Are you wearing a rat on your shoulder? Why would I be wearing-
[1341.18s -> 1347.62s]  What the fuck? Boss, we got big problems. The Cat Police are here. Are you kidding me right now,
[1347.62s -> 1354.10s]  Cat Police? Get us the fuck out of here. Get us out. We're getting the fuck out of here.
[1354.10s -> 1357.62s]  Come on, gentlemen. You can't believe it. You just did it. I just did it.
[1362.76s -> 1368.68s]  Good job, Cat Police. You did it again. You saved the world. And that's what we do as Cat Police.
[1368.68s -> 1371.48s]  We make the world a better place.
[1379.03s -> 1394.94s]  Whoa. What the? What's happening? Where am I? Oh, that was awesome. That was awesome.
[1396.17s -> 1400.57s]  There you go. There was rat movie mystery of the Mayan treasure fully animated.
[1403.43s -> 1412.63s]  Reimagining of the whole thing. Let's go over who made that possible. All these people.
[1413.35s -> 1424.15s]  That was absolutely fantastic. This video is now going to be probably public
[1424.79s -> 1442.62s]  on the second channel. If you want to watch it again. We are all rats. Yeah, that was- I was
[1442.62s -> 1448.90s]  going to show that like last week, but some of the things kind of were happening. Had to delay.
[1451.70s -> 1457.27s]  This is my two- this is a 2,000 subscriber video?
[1464.44s -> 1467.96s]  You know, I forgot that Burger Boy Eats a Cheeseburger. That video is fascinating.
[1467.96s -> 1483.61s]  I forgot about that. I forgot the password. That's a funny meme. You know, that's a funny meme,
[1483.61s -> 1486.97s]  but here's the funny- here's the actual sad funny part about what you just said.
[1488.09s -> 1492.73s]  I have not logged into my German 985 account probably in so long that it would not register
[1492.73s -> 1500.41s]  the IP as being mine. It'd probably be like, alert, fraud activity. Somebody is trying to
[1500.41s -> 1507.26s]  log into your account from Las Vegas? Holy shit, this has to be a fucking hacker.
[1510.82s -> 1516.79s]  Yeah, but excellent work. Chestnut is the one that organized it and put it all together.
[1516.79s -> 1532.89s]  Good stuff. And that is that. The refinal like sus face. There you go. I think that might be
[1532.89s -> 1545.70s]  public now on the second channel. You are the sus face. But Repentance came out. I was going
[1545.70s -> 1550.74s]  to play The Sims 1, but I really wanted to give some time here to talk about everything and talk
[1550.74s -> 1563.27s]  to you guys. It's still premiering? Oh, well, you'll see it later. You're living what? Maybe
[1563.27s -> 1571.64s]  the sus was the friends we made along the way. But long story short, and also by the way,
[1571.64s -> 1578.36s]  there are other streams right now being worked on. Do not take me saying that I'm going to be-
[1578.36s -> 1583.72s]  And by the way, when I say once a week, I mean scheduled once a week. The same day,
[1583.72s -> 1590.82s]  the same time every week. So no more, oh, maybe it'll be on Monday. I guess maybe I'll see you on
[1590.82s -> 1596.81s]  Thursday. And then maybe Friday. This is going to be a schedule. Every time at the same point,
[1596.81s -> 1603.88s]  same place. Now, how this becomes something I need to work on is when is that going to be?
[1603.88s -> 1611.35s]  When should I do this once a week? Maybe one to two days in a row. Should it be Saturday?
[1611.35s -> 1619.78s]  Should it be Sunday? And I think the idea is to do one more of these on Saturday. And then maybe
[1619.78s -> 1623.54s]  do like some polls and see what you guys have to say. Maybe we can see when the most people
[1623.54s -> 1629.78s]  are around for that once a week. There's a hundred subs. Yeah. Holy shit. It was PQ.
[1630.50s -> 1644.47s]  P. Q. P. Quay? Am I saying that right? A hundred subs, community subs. Yeah. Saturday,
[1644.47s -> 1650.89s]  definitely Saturday. Yeah, it'll probably end up being on the weekend because the weekend,
[1650.89s -> 1655.46s]  obviously, is the most- probably the most people can watch anyways. And I'm going to try to make it
[1655.46s -> 1661.67s]  early enough so some of the EU crowd is not going to have to- Oh, it's Saturday. Can't wait
[1661.67s -> 1666.17s]  for Saturday at 4 PM. Well, that's the one time a week that it's going to be live and I'll never
[1666.17s -> 1675.45s]  see it. So most likely Saturday, not early in the morning, but somewhere around probably 12
[1675.45s -> 1683.74s]  Pacific. I think 12 PM Pacific on Saturday is a perfect place for it. There's 22,000 people here.
[1683.74s -> 1693.11s]  Holy shit. Well, what's up, guys? What I was going to say before I cut my- I keep cutting myself off
[1693.11s -> 1700.10s]  mid-sense. Just because I'm going to be streaming less does not mean that there's not still stuff
[1700.10s -> 1704.34s]  going to happen. It's not like, oh, here we go. Once a week. Forget about all the other shit that
[1704.34s -> 1710.50s]  I was going to do and all the plans I had. I'm just going to open up fucking Isaac for a couple
[1710.50s -> 1714.57s]  hours or whatever Saturday and then see you later. No, there's still tons of shit going on. There's
[1714.57s -> 1719.98s]  tons of projects, tons of interesting things that I think are going to be really fun. A few big
[1719.98s -> 1725.62s]  streams are in the works right now and they're going to happen. And I just want to take the time
[1725.62s -> 1730.78s]  necessary to make sure that I can comfortably continue to do this and still enjoy doing it at
[1730.78s -> 1736.01s]  the same time. And I just tapped all of my fingers. I'm tapping it on the desk like this. I'm really-
[1736.01s -> 1745.13s]  I'm at the podium giving you guys a speech. The Catboy is confirmed. Yes. I mean, just, you're
[1745.13s -> 1752.92s]  going to- it'll be on Saturday. Well, no, no, no. It'll be on a Saturday. It's just- you'll know.
[1752.92s -> 1759.99s]  With all that being said, let's continue to do some of the things I want to do today.
[1759.99s -> 1764.28s]  I want to play the new Isaac. It's been a long time. I've been waiting for this to come out.
[1764.36s -> 1772.86s]  I'm excited to try it and mess around. But I hope I could give enough details on some things that
[1772.86s -> 1778.71s]  you guys understand kind of where I'm coming from. Because my 10-year anniversary is coming up in June,
[1778.71s -> 1784.28s]  right? June or July. Not 10 years on Twitch, but 10 years like on the internet as like an
[1784.28s -> 1791.88s]  e-clown. And as we cross this 10-year period and I start to get a little older, I want to make sure
[1791.88s -> 1795.32s]  that- and the medical stuff continues to be a thing. I really want to make sure it's something
[1795.32s -> 1800.92s]  I want to continue to do and that I'm still having fun doing. Because that's what keeps me
[1800.92s -> 1805.48s]  here at the end of the day, is that. Am I having fun doing this? Do I still want to be here? Am I
[1805.48s -> 1810.39s]  still enjoying myself when I'm here? That has to continue to be yes or I'm not going to do it.
[1810.39s -> 1820.15s]  Got to be very clear. So doing this is the way that I'm able to do that. 70-year anniversary.
[1820.15s -> 1830.92s]  When are you going to do a Jeremy Elvertson face cam? Do what you need to do. Yeah. And
[1831.48s -> 1840.81s]  look, eventually here as the years go by, I don't have a plan, right? I'm going to keep doing this
[1840.81s -> 1845.53s]  as long as I'm still being able to and enjoy it and stuff. I don't have a plan. It's not like,
[1845.53s -> 1852.22s]  oh in five years I can't wait to be this, this, this, this, this. No, I'm just doing this and
[1852.22s -> 1861.61s]  I'm just here. So let's go ahead and pull this up now. Back to Binding of Isaac. I've been looking
[1861.61s -> 1870.86s]  forward to playing this. Volume up a little. I have not played one second of this new expansion,
[1870.86s -> 1877.03s]  so I'm looking forward to it. I hope I have the... Last time I played Isaac, I had a save file,
[1877.03s -> 1892.42s]  right? Among Us. He peeked at Among Us. I didn't peek at Among Us. I've never played Among Us.
[1894.49s -> 1906.04s]  Do you understand? I can't use the controller. There we go. Let's go. New run. Oh, he's annoyed.
[1907.59s -> 1913.67s]  I've never played Among Us. I was my, I was ripped into a meme that I didn't even know
[1913.67s -> 1920.17s]  was going to be a thing. And then I became the Among Us sus guy. I didn't peek at Among Us.
[1920.89s -> 1925.13s]  Like that had nothing to do with me. That wasn't even my face. That was manipulated to a point
[1925.13s -> 1937.69s]  where it wasn't even me. Everything. Kane? Uh, I usually do... Let's go Kane. Among Us peeked at
[1937.69s -> 1950.10s]  you. Oh shit. Um, wait, why? What's, what is going on here? Why is it, why am I the second player?
[1952.92s -> 1975.77s]  What? Oh my. Dude, how did I activate co-op? I didn't do anything. Is the controller fucking broken?
[1976.33s -> 1990.47s]  What on earth just happened? Do I have to? I can't play keyboard and mouse with Isaac. No way.
[1993.14s -> 2006.01s]  What? Hold on a second. This thing, it doesn't work anymore. Control disconnected. Re-press any
[2006.01s -> 2011.58s]  button. What the? I don't know why this keeps happening. There's something going on with the
[2011.58s -> 2022.25s]  slot. Oh no. This is the Xbox one, but it shouldn't be doing this. Stream cancelled.
[2024.87s -> 2033.27s]  I'll show you next Saturday. Once a week. I have no idea why this is happening. Have you
[2033.27s -> 2039.03s]  guys noticed? I swear to God, there's a fucking conspiracy here. I'm going to go off on conspiracy
[2039.03s -> 2046.15s]  shit right now. They have made all USB cables worse over the last five years. Do you remember?
[2046.15s -> 2052.47s]  I used to have the same USB cable, the same lightning cable for fucking decades and they
[2052.47s -> 2059.51s]  worked fine. These new USB cables, they, they degrade so rapidly. It's, they, it's on purpose.
[2060.31s -> 2069.59s]  I have not gone through, I've gone through so many USB cables the last year than I have in the last
[2069.59s -> 2080.20s]  10 straight years. What happened? And lightning cables, like iPhone cables. What are they doing?
[2081.86s -> 2086.34s]  All right. I hope I can find a new cable. Or can you do Bluetooth with, um, can I do wireless
[2086.34s -> 2091.82s]  with the Xbox controller? Oh my God. What a pain in the ass. Yeah, but see, I can't even get out of
[2091.82s -> 2097.35s]  here. Press any button. I'm stuck in, in this, I'm stuck here. Why?
[2163.62s -> 2179.32s]  All right. I got one. I got it. Okay. This is USB-C. Why do they have so many different USBs?
[2179.32s -> 2188.28s]  Just make one. Micro USB, mini USB, USB-C, a USB 2.0, a USB 3.0. Just have one fucking cable.
[2188.28s -> 2197.78s]  One cable. One USB cable. Why is this seven? Who, who's doing this? Fuck them. Get Congress.
[2197.78s -> 2219.24s]  Get Congress involved. Right back. Everybody hold on. That's literally right in the next room.
[2219.24s -> 2225.48s]  Oh my God. This is what happens when you just, he's mentally deranged. I'm fine. I'll be right back.
[2226.28s -> 2328.38s]  Okay. I found one. Found a USB cable and this one, this one works. Remember we went through three.
[2328.94s -> 2337.37s]  This is what it's like to get old. I think it just ran out of treadmill for like an hour.
[2338.94s -> 2359.08s]  Okay. Now what? What is going on now? Does it think I'm, thinks I'm, how do I fix this?
[2359.64s -> 2383.83s]  All right. Die. Wait, who am I? Am I, am I player two? Restart. New game. I want to be
[2384.82s -> 2398.76s]  Kane on hard. Dude, I just, what the fuck is happening? What is it doing this?
[2400.95s -> 2409.43s]  What the fuck is happening? Restart the whole game? I can't even hit any buttons. Why is this,
[2409.43s -> 2413.43s]  how many people can play together? Why does it think there's five people in the room?
[2414.23s -> 2424.63s]  What is happening? Why is it that I am now using the controller? Who am I controlling?
[2428.66s -> 2439.18s]  I'm multiplying, but why? Why am I multiplying? Why is it the three Isaacs? What?
[2439.82s -> 2453.67s]  Did I use this to my advantage? Start button spamming. Go into the menu. I can't even go
[2453.67s -> 2463.34s]  on the menu. Every, restart the whole game. Use one hand. But how come I can't even hit escape?
[2464.14s -> 2482.58s]  Just restart the whole game. Alt F4. Yeah. But why is that happening? Okay. Alt F4. All right.
[2482.58s -> 2490.95s]  Somebody help me here. What's going on? Your computer's infected. Isaac and Isaac with his
[2490.95s -> 2501.67s]  Isaac. This is what happens in Germany. It gets too high. Windows settings. Okay. Go into Windows
[2501.67s -> 2508.82s]  settings. The PC has encountered software. But why would it be? It's, you might've had, you, you,
[2508.82s -> 2513.70s]  you might've had two controllers plugged in, but you don't realize. No way. That's not even
[2514.10s -> 2521.26s]  possible. That's impossible. You were with the controls while the game was open. What?
[2522.33s -> 2526.33s]  Only press start with the controller you want to play with as player one. Yeah. That's what I did.
[2526.33s -> 2534.23s]  And I loaded into the game and then I was the player two. Be patient, chat. He's bald.
[2535.45s -> 2541.54s]  Blow on the cartridge. All right. Hold on. Enable, enable, enable, enable. It's not the USB. It's the
[2541.54s -> 2547.35s]  game. I had the same issue. Unplug your Xbox controller and exit the game. Okay. All right.
[2547.35s -> 2561.77s]  Let's go back in. I, I've unplugged it. I plugged it back in. Does it work? Okay. I'm in the game.
[2562.33s -> 2567.85s]  I have the controller in my hand. I, I, I'm using the analog right now. This is the controller.
[2567.85s -> 2575.37s]  Controller is now activated. New game. I am now playing as Kane with, I, this is the controller.
[2576.47s -> 2593.40s]  Kane. Okay. What the hell happened? All right. So this is the binding of Isaac repentance.
[2594.20s -> 2597.88s]  I'm already angry at it. I'm already like, I'm very upset right now.
[2598.84s -> 2608.14s]  I, that's all these new features. Okay. We're good. Please tell Jerma every time you want.
[2608.14s -> 2612.14s]  It's because you plugged in the controller after starting the game probably. No, cause I was,
[2613.02s -> 2621.93s]  did you actually have four players in the game or was that a weird bug? Did I just, hold on. Did
[2621.93s -> 2630.42s]  we just find a potential like speed run thing to do to be able to have like four Isaacs and just
[2630.42s -> 2632.82s]  somehow have a bunch of devices hooked up to you where you control them all?
[2635.69s -> 2640.94s]  The, the multiplayer was, you, you were a little ghost, right? No, you're not special.
[2643.42s -> 2646.78s]  All right. Let me get into this. I love this game. I have more time in this than any of the game on
[2646.78s -> 2652.06s]  Steam. So I had CF2. It's a fact. You want me to prove it? Take my word for it. I'm not fucking
[2652.06s -> 2659.13s]  showing you. I don't care. It's upgraded multiplayer. Oh, wow. That's awesome. Actually.
[2659.77s -> 2663.30s]  Is it online or is it co-op only? Cause it was called only for the longest time, right?
[2664.10s -> 2669.77s]  Kane's got better pills. No, he doesn't. He doesn't care about us.
[2670.65s -> 2675.99s]  That's right. It's got remote play. Okay. I guess it would be hard with lag to do this, right?
[2678.76s -> 2686.02s]  The music is terrible. Oh, that is Scorpio poison tears. That's pretty good. Stop. That's pretty
[2686.02s -> 2696.97s]  good. Stop. How can I go in here? You no longer need keys to go into that's a weird change. You
[2696.97s -> 2708.78s]  don't need a key anymore. Really? Not the first shop. Oh, wow. That's insane. That's a really
[2708.78s -> 2715.61s]  good. That's a good change. Although does it really matter? Cause getting more than 15 coins on the
[2715.61s -> 2721.93s]  first floor is pretty rare to do anyways, right? But I guess it's better. New coin noise. I don't
[2721.93s -> 2737.03s]  think I like it. But what I was saying, anybody know of the new stuff? Do I need to have beaten
[2737.03s -> 2741.35s]  the game a certain way a bunch of times to have the new stuff unlocked? Cause I don't know where
[2741.35s -> 2748.94s]  this actually sits. I know that I've beaten the game probably like 40 times on this save file.
[2749.58s -> 2754.54s]  That's the thing with Isaac. I have so many save files. I have this. I have a ton of time on the
[2754.54s -> 2767.74s]  switch. I have a ton of time on the PC. You got to kill something three times. Three times beaten.
[2767.74s -> 2774.31s]  You just have to beat the game 120 times to get the character unlocks. Cause on the switch version,
[2774.31s -> 2778.07s]  I have a ton of time. I've beaten the gradier mode on every character and stuff, but I don't
[2778.07s -> 2781.99s]  think I've done it once on the PC version. So we'll see what happens. All right. Let's go.
[2781.99s -> 2789.50s]  Wait, one more. Okay. Run on extra HUD. Oh, that's right. Why is that not on?
[2793.40s -> 2797.72s]  I just gave somebody an absolute heart attack by putting that on. Can you, can you imagine
[2798.28s -> 2804.60s]  that like just, just like the pixels changing from where the F is to where N is, right? Like
[2804.60s -> 2813.90s]  OFF to ON just cause somebody a fucking breakdown. Think about that. Interesting. The gamma up to 120.
[2818.82s -> 2827.93s]  Oh yeah. The pop-ups, active cam, extra HUD. There we go. Mini. HUD offset. Ooh,
[2827.93s -> 2835.93s]  I didn't know you could do this. Kind of want it like there. Found HUD. I thought it said garbage
[2835.93s -> 2847.00s]  bars. Is it too bright? I'd like it to be 110. 115. Found HUD on. All right. Let's give it a try.
[2849.10s -> 2858.62s]  Oh yeah. That's much better. Turn the charge bars on too. No, I like to guess. Die. Is it
[2858.62s -> 2871.24s]  going to get me through? Yes, it is. Charge bars show things like brimstone. Yeah. But for me,
[2871.24s -> 2880.47s]  they distract me. I'm not going in that room. And I know so many people are going to watch me play
[2880.47s -> 2887.27s]  this and they're going to say, Oh my God, just run into the boss room. Hurry up to go to the boss
[2887.27s -> 2893.51s]  room. And I'm going to be like, no, I want to individually go and hit the poops and look around
[2893.51s -> 2898.81s]  and stuff. People are going to say, Oh, just like, God, it takes me 20 minutes to get through this.
[2898.81s -> 2904.90s]  It's been an hour for him. That's what we do here. That's how you have to watch me stream games.
[2905.62s -> 2910.10s]  What would normally take you 40 minutes will take me two hours. That's just the way it is.
[2910.82s -> 2916.55s]  That's the way it is. And you're here. Don't leave. Don't please. I'll be, I'll go faster.
[2916.55s -> 2928.30s]  I promise. Watch this. Ready? One photo. Tears. Oh good. Tears up. That's good. Let's move. I know
[2928.30s -> 2939.96s]  people, I'm going to miss tinted rocks. I know Isaac is underrated. I don't know if I agree with
[2939.96s -> 2945.67s]  that. I think a lot of people love this game. What's this thing on the right? That purple thing.
[2947.58s -> 2961.00s]  What is that? A little purple hook. Did I pick that up? Oh, it's the curse. Okay. I love this game.
[2963.62s -> 2969.62s]  I know that Edmund, Edmund, I can't say his name. Edmund, Edmund Macmillan said that this is the
[2969.62s -> 2981.37s]  last Isaac expansion. He's kind of, this game is so fun. Everybody loves this game so much.
[2981.37s -> 2986.57s]  I almost kind of feel bad in a way because he's just like, oh, fuck, this game is so fun.
[2986.57s -> 2991.69s]  Everybody loves this and it's like an amazing creation. I have to make more of them. I have
[2991.69s -> 3006.78s]  to continue to make them. He said that he was going to make a two eventually in 3D because he
[3006.78s -> 3011.82s]  can, he can pull that. He could go to 3D, right? It could be like super Nintendo going to N64. We
[3011.82s -> 3020.79s]  could have N64 graphics with Binding of Isaac 2. I'm not talking 3D like now 3D. I'm talking like
[3021.59s -> 3045.53s]  Nintendo 64. Do I want the key? No. Still got it. I love the poison. Welcome back,
[3046.09s -> 3058.41s]  Gerber. Ooh, wait, don't use it. How is he not getting hit? I am a living demigod. Mom's locket,
[3058.41s -> 3075.27s]  you feel her love. What does mom's locket do? I don't know. Doesn't this open somehow? More
[3075.27s -> 3083.61s]  hearts? The locket opens, doesn't it? Opening things will heal you. Oh, okay.
[3085.53s -> 3090.98s]  Really? You had to make like the funny breathe in joke? You just don't get hit. Like I could
[3090.98s -> 3096.26s]  have avoided that. I had to do like the funny look at my breathing pattern. It was stupid.
[3101.58s -> 3108.62s]  Go to the shop. I don't have enough money. Ooh, rainbow poop. That's a full heal, right? Yeah.
[3109.18s -> 3118.22s]  I did, what hit it? You should be ashamed. That's why I said it. I am ashamed that I would
[3118.22s -> 3124.66s]  even attempt that. Use diaper, use stink. That's something to do with flies, right?
[3125.22s -> 3133.29s]  Remember, you're not streaming. You forgot to click the stream button. That's better.
[3134.92s -> 3147.11s]  Chance to get hearts when opening stuff or a poopoo. Remember the hearts? No, not doing that.
[3149.64s -> 3159.86s]  We can't see the game. That would take some serious discipline from you guys to not say that,
[3159.86s -> 3167.88s]  besides the one person that just did. Are you going to scream from the retirement home?
[3170.02s -> 3178.23s]  No, absolutely not. Another joke is made that, oh man, I'm going to stream forever.
[3178.23s -> 3188.44s]  We're going to be 70. No, I'm not. No. Guys, I will be long gone well before my 70th birthday.
[3189.24s -> 3196.34s]  Oh, is this the ghost pepper? Lame tears. Oh, nice. These explode though, don't they?
[3198.98s -> 3203.96s]  Why can't we grow old together? Hey, you want to hear something really sad?
[3204.84s -> 3223.24s]  When you guys are 70, I'll be dead. That's like really sad. Holy fuck. Yeah, guys,
[3223.24s -> 3228.86s]  you understand? When you're like 80 years old, I will have been dead for probably 20 years.
[3228.86s -> 3241.98s]  How old are you? We're at 20? 19? The most age group here is like 18 to 24. Did I miss
[3241.98s -> 3254.60s]  something? What did I miss? I'll go in the shop now. That thing halves all damage, right?
[3258.97s -> 3273.80s]  Don't put that on. Is that something that reduces damage? That's like when you die,
[3273.80s -> 3284.86s]  something happens when you die. Oh, they changed a bunch of stuff. I'm going to get the bag.
[3284.86s -> 3291.70s]  Nice. That's a good return, except it wasn't. They're going to be really mad about this.
[3291.70s -> 3302.02s]  Okay. Should I get it? I don't have an active. That's not worth it. I'll save it.
[3302.02s -> 3315.91s]  All right. I'm going to go to the boss. I am furious. 19 gang here. 19 gang.
[3317.37s -> 3326.60s]  Um, all right. Monstro. Sometimes you got to use a fucking nice, quick, utilized bomb.
[3327.32s -> 3337.18s]  Although I guess with default enemies, that was kind of not worth it. That does a lot of damage.
[3337.74s -> 3346.20s]  Does it stick on them? Holy shit. That's insane. That was a ton of damage. All right. This is a
[3346.20s -> 3358.90s]  luck up and keys, right? All right. And I got, uh, why are those blinking? Why are the black hearts
[3358.90s -> 3367.94s]  blinking? Oh, you never give one heart for, uh, for a little familiar. The new animation. Oh,
[3367.94s -> 3380.94s]  they explode. Let's go. Five-year-old Isaac two with N64 PS1 graphics. They're similar.
[3381.66s -> 3386.15s]  Yeah, that'd be, I would be okay with that. I think that'd be pretty cool.
[3386.79s -> 3402.31s]  Oh, we're not twenties. Not everybody here is in their twenties. 19. All right. Let's spend it.
[3402.31s -> 3416.38s]  Did they change the slot machine at all? All right. I'll take it down to 10. That's it. All
[3416.38s -> 3428.54s]  right. Blow it up so I don't get tempted to do it again. Perfect. Uh, that, uh, that one's really
[3428.54s -> 3433.58s]  good. That's the one that does your tears damage instantly when you spend a coin, right? That one's
[3433.58s -> 3443.53s]  awesome. It sucks. What do you mean it sucks? No, for fucking idiots like me, I just get a million
[3443.53s -> 3452.65s]  coins and I go to a boss and I go, and the boss dies. That item is trash. Whatever. Map is probably
[3452.65s -> 3478.52s]  more useful. Yeah. Excuse me. Mr. Green. Get out of here. Hey, uh, okay. Good. Cool. How many items
[3478.52s -> 3483.40s]  have they changed? And how can you be so certain that these items are what you think they are?
[3483.40s -> 3502.26s]  This is brand new content. There's a lot of nerfs too. Oh, let's go down. Remember you don't have
[3502.26s -> 3510.22s]  any new unlocks. Yeah. But I mean, won't, won't they show up? Items should show up.
[3520.63s -> 3529.22s]  Wouldn't the new items appear like in the pool of items? Yeah, they wouldn't. Who are you talking to?
[3533.35s -> 3548.74s]  Most new items are unlocks. Yeah. Not yet. Who are you talking to? That's right. Nice. That's my
[3548.74s -> 3556.65s]  favorite comment of the day. For sure. Cause if you really think about it, I am just speaking out
[3556.65s -> 3563.96s]  loud in a room. I'll, I'm by myself in a room. I'm not physically talking to anybody. My voice
[3563.96s -> 3577.24s]  is being transmitted through alien technology into your alien technology desktop. That's zoinked.
[3577.24s -> 3592.86s]  You're zonked. That's a new enemy. That's not. I don't know. I'm of the opinion that the fact
[3592.86s -> 3608.73s]  that your microwave works, we had to have been visited by aliens at some point. Right? The fact
[3608.81s -> 3617.99s]  that this is like a box that like goes and your food is ready to eat in a minute.
[3617.99s -> 3621.35s]  Like how did they, how'd you even come up with that? Why would you even do that? Why would you
[3621.35s -> 3628.62s]  even think to do that? Who fucking made the first microwave? It was like, you know what? Let's say
[3628.62s -> 3642.66s]  I'll put radiation in a box in your house and turn it up to like a million. What? It was Dr. Wave.
[3645.21s -> 3650.90s]  Just Google it. No, I don't, I don't want to do any research or Google anything. I want you to tell me
[3651.62s -> 3655.86s]  what it was. I don't want to actually figure it out. I want you to tell me anything and I'll
[3655.86s -> 3665.45s]  just believe you. Come on. Like typing in Google, like who invented the microwave?
[3666.25s -> 3673.45s]  It's like Dr. D micro. Okay. Yeah. No, but like you told me, just tell me it was aliens
[3673.45s -> 3680.07s]  that gave the technology to us. And then I don't, that's it. That's what it is. Use incognito.
[3683.18s -> 3690.30s]  Imagine how fucking paranoid of a person you would be to be like scared to Google who invented the
[3690.30s -> 3697.43s]  microwave. Why would you need incognito for that? No, no, no. I can't have anybody's ever seen this.
[3697.43s -> 3701.75s]  Nobody in my house. Nobody. I can't have Google though. Who invented the microwave? No, no, no,
[3701.75s -> 3716.57s]  no, no. Incognito for that one. Faded Polaroid. You feel fated. What's that? God damn it. Stop
[3716.57s -> 3727.69s]  calling me out. What does this do? I almost said faded microwave. Does a microwave get
[3728.25s -> 3735.46s]  like diminishing returns over time? But can it just generate radiation energy for forever?
[3738.31s -> 3746.12s]  Does it burn out? Does the thing burn out in the middle? What are you even saying anymore? I'm
[3746.12s -> 3766.66s]  saying like when your microwave goes bad, are you okay? Okay. I got to stop like fucking being
[3766.66s -> 3775.27s]  stupid. Oh, when a microwave goes bad, please God give me a conversation to hold while my brain is
[3775.27s -> 3782.10s]  in a different location playing Binding of Isaac. Hey, do microwaves go bad? Almond milk. Damage
[3782.10s -> 3793.64s]  down, tears up. You feel. Oh Jesus. I shouldn't have picked this up. Wait, that's going to make
[3793.64s -> 3800.82s]  way more fires, right? What's wrong with me? Why am I fading out for? What do all these things do?
[3801.46s -> 3825.46s]  Why am I? I'm faded. You're faded. What's my damage? 1.3. That's horrible. All right. Secret
[3825.46s -> 3834.17s]  rooms right here. Probably. Maybe. Fires are good. Yeah, the fires are going to be awesome.
[3835.05s -> 3837.85s]  No, let's just kill the boss. Whatever. I got money though. Should I go in there?
[3843.03s -> 3847.66s]  Faded. Yeah, I'll get the map. It's definitely worth it. I need to get more damage or this
[3847.66s -> 3855.51s]  run is over. I need at least five to six damage or this run is over. Over. It's not coming back
[3855.51s -> 3866.23s]  over. Oh, secrets. Like the almond milk and like the soy milk, right? Whatever. The things that
[3866.23s -> 3872.23s]  make you just shoot a million miles per hour, but your damage is terrible. I'm of the opinion
[3872.23s -> 3877.75s]  that if you don't have at least five damage by floor five, just fucking uninstall and come back
[3877.75s -> 3891.91s]  later. Right here. What is that? That's new. Oh man. What is that? That's like mega dog food.
[3892.55s -> 3906.46s]  That's a full dog meal. I need bombs. That's seriously omega dog food. All right. I need
[3906.46s -> 3926.47s]  bombs now. The dog feast. Bomb. All right. I'm going for it. They're all concussed. Is that
[3926.47s -> 3934.79s]  what the faded lemon does? Actually, nevermind. With the fire, this might be fine. I just need
[3934.79s -> 3949.29s]  more luck. Holy shit. That's actually awesome. The fire is amazing. Bomb. Shot speed up. I'll take it.
[3949.77s -> 3958.62s]  Shot speed up. And that's Guppy's caller. Eternal life. Imagine getting Guppy with this. Faded
[3958.62s -> 3969.05s]  brain. I need a bomb for this damn thing. Microwave fact incoming. Microwave fact incoming.
[3971.38s -> 3978.09s]  I think it was deleted. Yeah. I think you guys, that's like spam. In 1945, the heating effect of
[3978.09s -> 3981.77s]  a high-power microwave beam was accidentally discovered by Percy Spencer, an American self-taught
[3981.77s -> 3986.25s]  engineer from Howland, Maine. Employed by Raytheon at the time, he noticed that microwaves
[3986.89s -> 3991.69s]  form an active rate from an active radar set he was working on started to melt a chocolate bar
[3991.69s -> 3997.45s]  he had in his pocket. The first food deliberately cooked with Spencer's microwave was popcorn,
[3997.45s -> 4003.85s]  and the second was an egg which exploded in the face. It exploded in his face?
[4006.33s -> 4011.88s]  Was there no cover on the microwave? Wait, did he not, was it like a microwave convertible? He
[4011.88s -> 4016.95s]  just could look down and just blew up in his face? I can't get, with the bombs in the shop.
[4020.68s -> 4029.83s]  That sucks, but whatever. Let's go. I can't get that thing. That mega dog meal. I want it so bad.
[4030.47s -> 4047.56s]  All right, pestilence. Let's go. Am I negating his dogs with this? Okay, I was completely wrong.
[4047.56s -> 4060.66s]  This is really good. Bandage. No bombs, though. That sucks, whatever it is. Can't get it. You just
[4060.66s -> 4069.11s]  mulched that guy. That's a really, that's a great term. I've mulched him. All right, whatever.
[4072.15s -> 4086.92s]  Shop. There's no bomb in the shop. I was just in there. Just give me more damage. I don't care
[4086.92s -> 4093.62s]  about anything else. Just damage up. Damage up and shop. Of course I get two. Damage up and
[4095.70s -> 4109.22s]  tier size up. I missed a bomb? I don't think I did. What are these? This is new. Spiked rocks?
[4109.22s -> 4128.66s]  What does that mean? I'm not wasting the bomb. What was that? Come on, open, open, open, open.
[4129.46s -> 4145.50s]  Oh, I had a black heart, right? Oh, come on. Infamy. Blocked damage sometimes. Oh,
[4145.50s -> 4162.50s]  this is really good. As long as I'm facing the right direction. I like the Isaac music when it
[4162.50s -> 4185.40s]  goes. Stop pretending. You know, you could probably like program a chat bot for right
[4185.48s -> 4191.08s]  stop pretending at intervals of like eight minutes. And like a streamer, like I would just look over
[4191.08s -> 4198.70s]  and see it and be like, Oh, what the fuck? I'm not. That's the, that's the guaranteed way to make any
[4198.70s -> 4203.58s]  streamer be like annoyed for a second. Guaranteed. Even if it's, you just, maybe if you're making it
[4203.58s -> 4216.92s]  up, you're just saying it for fun. Doesn't matter. This guy's different. This is the same coin.
[4216.92s -> 4238.12s]  What's it? Coin bomb. What is he? Is this new? What'd he do? Charge. He's a charge bomb. Oh,
[4238.76s -> 4250.84s]  I thought it was, I thought it was coin C for coin. Well, what are, I don't, okay. There's more to
[4250.84s -> 4262.55s]  look at. Hold on. Microwave. Oh, they're monsters. They're monsters. Microwave.
[4269.66s -> 4275.35s]  Hey, they're putting utensils in the microwave. You can't do that.
[4276.07s -> 4293.46s]  Why are you doing that? I don't know. I don't think, does anybody get that? I don't think anybody got
[4293.46s -> 4303.51s]  it. Whatever. That's fine. All right. Last one. What are you talking about? Nobody? Oh, wow.
[4303.51s -> 4310.12s]  All right. What the fuck are you saying? I don't know. I was, that was the buff scene from Gremlins
[4310.12s -> 4324.92s]  2. I like that movie. All right. Should I, should I take the umbilical cord or the, the thing? This
[4324.92s -> 4333.51s]  faded a picture. I have no idea what the faded picture really even does. Just hit them with the,
[4333.51s -> 4347.27s]  what? The faded. All right. Give me something good. That's good. One shot. Got it. Yep. Why love?
[4347.27s -> 4356.57s]  Hooray. All right. Uh, I just wanted money. Baldi. I see that was a lot of message for something
[4356.57s -> 4374.34s]  I'm not going to read. So whatever. Ooh. I need bombs. Wait. No, I don't. Who has these bombs and
[4374.34s -> 4389.38s]  you can fly. Sorry. You just, you just like picked me up from my armpits. Like me deadweighting you.
[4389.38s -> 4402.90s]  You just lifted me up by the armpits. Leave me alone. Get away from me. Get away from me. Get
[4402.90s -> 4415.24s]  away from me. Get away from me. What the fuck does that picture do? That was quagmire.
[4420.10s -> 4431.51s]  It was quagmire. I can't even replicate it. I can't replicate it. I don't even know what it was.
[4431.51s -> 4441.46s]  Um, I don't want to take a guess. Why would I do that? Hi Jerma. Hold on. This looks like
[4441.46s -> 4447.90s]  an important message. Hi Jerma. New items will show up and stuff, but to unlock the new alternative
[4447.90s -> 4454.28s]  path and endings, you need to beat hush three times. Okay. If you've already gotten a lot of
[4454.28s -> 4458.84s]  after birth plus unlocks, you might not feel too bad just downloading a complete AB plus save
[4458.84s -> 4466.34s]  and starting repentance from there. Okay. Um, I, I think I've beaten hush at least once or twice
[4466.34s -> 4480.74s]  on here. Download a save. That always feels so icky to me though. Like I, do I want to do it?
[4480.74s -> 4495.64s]  All right. I had to do it to beat hush three times. Yeah. Hush is obnoxious. Oh my God. What
[4495.64s -> 4521.66s]  am I doing? Use cheat engine. Um, ah, maybe I'll get a save file. Watch out. When does this come
[4521.66s -> 4532.47s]  in a switch too? I like playing this in bed. That's everything, right? Yeah, that's literally
[4532.47s -> 4546.98s]  never be serious. I mean, literally never hurting my head, seeing that many things happen.
[4554.71s -> 4557.99s]  Mom's pearls range and luck up. I'll take the luck for the fire. That's awesome.
[4558.71s -> 4568.02s]  All right. What do you got? No, I'm not doing this beating using we shark to beat this game.
[4569.43s -> 4595.75s]  Take them, do it. No. Oh, get out of here. Get out of here. Those are the worst rooms in the whole
[4595.75s -> 4614.26s]  game. These guys jump. I don't like it. Good. Stop pretending. Tending to like be good.
[4615.14s -> 4623.22s]  I see that context can mean anything. It could be what I'm saying. Stop pretending to not know
[4623.22s -> 4627.62s]  what that is. Stop pretending to be good. We all know you're bad. Stop pretending to be bad for
[4627.62s -> 4642.33s]  views. That's another one too is how is he so bad? Oh, that one drives me nuts. I hate that one.
[4644.81s -> 4652.38s]  I don't I guess I could get some bombs. Oh, no, he you don't get bombs. You give them bombs.
[4652.38s -> 4673.93s]  Well, now you have to die. Oh, fuck. I'm not okay. Give him more bombs. I only have four.
[4673.93s -> 4687.90s]  I need them for secret rooms. How is he pretending this much? Well, I do. I hope everyone's doing
[4687.90s -> 4692.46s]  well. It's been a while since you've seen me. Those who that may have trickled in before will
[4692.46s -> 4697.02s]  go. We're going to go over some stuff here. We'll go over just quickly because there are a lot of
[4697.02s -> 4705.24s]  people here. So I got we got to reiterate some things. First and foremost, medical stuff is
[4705.24s -> 4709.80s]  progressing. I'm going I'm doing a lot of shit for it. I'm doing some treatments. I had a bunch of
[4709.80s -> 4718.63s]  injections into my back and I want these coins. The injections went into the muscle tissue around
[4718.63s -> 4726.14s]  my like spine and back area as a start. I might don't god damn it. I might do I might do more of
[4726.14s -> 4734.82s]  them. But the TLDR of this whole thing is I'm probably going to start doing more seriously
[4735.46s -> 4741.38s]  therapy work like body work, physical therapy, strength training back there. We're going to
[4741.38s -> 4744.98s]  try to see if we can get that area to not be as fucked up as it is for some reason,
[4744.98s -> 4747.94s]  which people still don't know why. That's the most frustrating part.
[4749.62s -> 4754.34s]  People don't still don't know exactly why this is happening. I've heard you have costochondritis.
[4755.14s -> 4760.26s]  What the fuck does that mean? That means you have your chest and your back rib cage hurts.
[4760.26s -> 4769.32s]  Why? I don't know. So now what? Well you can get a shot. Is that what I do?
[4769.32s -> 4774.04s]  Well you know it might not even be costochondritis. It could be the dehydrated disc you have in your
[4774.04s -> 4781.22s]  spine. What do I do about that? Oh nothing. What do you mean you don't do anything? Well
[4781.30s -> 4786.81s]  we could do like some trigger point therapy and okay. You know it also could you could be the
[4786.81s -> 4791.11s]  hernia. You have a little hiatal hernia. What do I do about that? Well nothing. Just like eat
[4791.11s -> 4797.77s]  different. That's just a change your diet so you don't get like GERD like acid reflux. Okay.
[4798.90s -> 4808.31s]  So now what? I'm not going to pick this up yet. So nobody there's been a couple of theories. Oh
[4808.31s -> 4816.52s]  you might have like myofascial pain syndrome. Okay. What does that mean? Well it hurts. Why?
[4816.52s -> 4833.85s]  I don't know. What? I don't know yet. But it's not bad enough where it's good. Look I it's not gonna
[4833.85s -> 4842.70s]  I can walk fine. I can sit. I can. I'm sitting here right now right. But it just it's just kind
[4842.70s -> 4846.62s]  of a problem constantly. And it's something that always kind of has to sit in the back of my mind
[4847.34s -> 4852.22s]  no matter what. No matter what I'm doing. And those of you that are in this chat that might have
[4852.22s -> 4856.14s]  one of these medical problems that isn't enough to really
[4856.86s -> 4860.94s]  debilitate you that much. But it's enough to constantly be a problem and you don't really
[4860.94s -> 4868.71s]  have an answer for it. I I feel you here. I do because it sucks. Is this new? What is this?
[4868.71s -> 4876.78s]  There's a can there be as tinted ground? That's a tinted ground. What? That's that's like a ground.
[4876.78s -> 4886.18s]  That means like there's something in the ground. Right? Look at that. That that's the exact thing
[4886.18s -> 4899.11s]  that's on the tinted rocks. Can I get a shovel or something? So I just want to make sure everyone's
[4899.11s -> 4907.56s]  not overly concerned about it or that oh my god what's wrong? You all right? I'm I'm fine. I am.
[4907.56s -> 4914.33s]  It's just a constant like three or four out of ten in the pain scale all day every day and it
[4914.33s -> 4922.84s]  doesn't stop and it hasn't stopped in almost three years. So it's I have to start to go down
[4922.84s -> 4929.64s]  some kind of path to figure out why the fuck this is happening. And even when I've tried to it's
[4929.64s -> 4945.18s]  become difficult. Oh more luck. Perfect. Somebody that's had uh chronic pain their whole life is
[4945.18s -> 4949.94s]  constantly told we don't know lol by doctors I feel like pain on a literal level. Yeah that's
[4949.94s -> 4953.70s]  that's that that sucks. It really does because I was really thinking that this is like two three
[4953.70s -> 4960.50s]  years ago. I was like oh man my like my like chest hurts and my back hurts. Um it's it's probably
[4960.50s -> 4965.06s]  nothing. Whatever. When it's when it's stuck around for like two or three weeks I went to the doctor
[4965.06s -> 4969.22s]  and it was like ah I mean they'll do like a like a CT scan of my back and they'll be oh you have
[4969.22s -> 4975.22s]  like this and it's like okay whatever fix it. When you when you kind of figure out that that's not
[4975.22s -> 4981.90s]  happening it's like oh no we don't really know why. And even the things that I've told them
[4982.78s -> 4987.90s]  um for instance some of them may be things that may have happened to me uh over the last three
[4987.90s -> 4992.94s]  or four years medically speaking uh mechanically speaking how do you sit how do you do this what
[4993.02s -> 4998.39s]  do you I've always kind of been told that well that might not be why you're having it it could
[4998.39s -> 5011.06s]  be something else so oh do I take that I break danced on the internet better pills are just
[5011.06s -> 5028.95s]  better how is puberty better what is adult oh I took puberty three times oh man chronic pain my
[5028.95s -> 5037.10s]  yeah yeah it's having no answer for why this is happening makes you like second guess everything
[5037.10s -> 5041.80s]  you ever hear too and there's a lot of times that you sit there and you go is this like am I making
[5041.80s -> 5047.21s]  this shit up am I just making this up somehow and then you like get in your own head you like
[5047.21s -> 5052.63s]  freak yourself out you're like no why would I do that that's not just no like very clearly like
[5052.63s -> 5064.92s]  it hurts like if I if I know it's painful um you kind of like getting your own head but it did it
[5064.92s -> 5071.72s]  just it kind of came out of it slowly over about a week or two got to the point that it is now and
[5071.72s -> 5076.70s]  it's it's never really gotten any worse but it's never gotten better that's the weirdest part
[5076.70s -> 5080.76s]  is typically if you have some potential pain problems right they either get better or they
[5080.76s -> 5087.58s]  don't and make it worse it's like do is do I have a small hernia is the hernia just constantly
[5087.58s -> 5092.22s]  putting pressure on like my uh the middle chest bone area that's what they thought it maybe like
[5092.22s -> 5096.46s]  maybe my they call it a xiphoid process it was like maybe your xiphoid process it's this little
[5096.46s -> 5100.38s]  thing that's just in the center of your chest maybe that's what's happened what happened to it
[5100.38s -> 5109.72s]  I've done everything let's go go to a chiropractor I have I have gone to a chiropractor many times
[5110.79s -> 5120.89s]  and it doesn't seem to fix anything in the sternum yeah I have radiating pain that goes
[5120.89s -> 5128.54s]  from the middle of my back through the center of my chest all day every day it has not stopped in
[5128.54s -> 5137.59s]  three years and at this point it's kind of like it's time to manage it rather than well I have
[5137.59s -> 5146.26s]  to figure out what it is I'm in like the try to manage it stage I have as you guys know I have
[5146.26s -> 5157.61s]  been to so many doctors about this and it's time just to try to manage it just manage it medical
[5157.61s -> 5165.42s]  physical therapy trigger point injections uh maybe some uh maybe like an intercostal nerve
[5165.42s -> 5168.94s]  block which is another thing to potentially do where they actually go in and they fuck with
[5168.94s -> 5178.98s]  the nerve in your like intercostal chest and back region I don't know get a tony starkheart
[5178.98s -> 5185.46s]  oh the white heart the eternal heart I just started talking shit it's okay I don't even need it
[5185.46s -> 5203.32s]  crutch I need to spend my money somewhere I have a lot of money I'm so mad I mean there's also the
[5203.32s -> 5208.60s]  theory too and I have to be honest right I can't just pretend like I don't have a pretty
[5209.80s -> 5216.33s]  sedentary lifestyle I try to move around but the worst part about it is when I do move around
[5216.33s -> 5222.23s]  it hurts if I do any type of real like kind of physical exercise or physical anything involving
[5222.23s -> 5232.42s]  my core oh I feel like shit for a week it's like I what's going on there well that makes it even
[5232.42s -> 5238.66s]  harder it's like oh maybe I need to like really work that area out and like and strengthen it but
[5238.66s -> 5250.50s]  when I do that it's like holy shit I can't even move for like fucking four days you think it was
[5250.50s -> 5258.36s]  when somebody in chat cursed you oh yeah I thought about that too oh I thought about that too yeah
[5258.92s -> 5263.80s]  I don't know I'm thinking like holy shit did I piss off some type of like warlock that was
[5263.80s -> 5269.10s]  watching the stream and he heard me say that like Pikmin 2 sucked or something and he's like just
[5269.10s -> 5279.85s]  put a warlock curse on me he's sitting there like in a bubbling cauldron he's got my stream open he
[5279.85s -> 5290.76s]  was like a fan or something and he was an old fan he saw where I put in and out on the tier list
[5290.76s -> 5297.18s]  and he threw like fucking frog's legs and like batlings into a fucking cauldron and just cursed
[5297.18s -> 5314.71s]  the shit out of me I don't know it's possible anything is possible at this point dude okay I
[5314.71s -> 5323.26s]  have to tell you a real story this is like this story is so uh I'm gonna tell it because
[5323.26s -> 5329.11s]  whatever I don't even care it's like it's it's the story sucks because I really thought like I
[5329.11s -> 5335.51s]  don't know if my brain started going oh my god wait a minute is this real so on Christmas Eve
[5336.62s -> 5345.13s]  of last uh two years ago I think it was I I woke up and I woke up and my back didn't really hurt

[8201.69s -> 8216.23s]  a while of course I know the song yeah I sing it all the time all the fucking time it just it
[8216.23s -> 8223.02s]  just appears every day it never goes away every day I don't know why it's better than the original
[8223.02s -> 8231.74s]  song I you know I never really I don't listen to that much music anymore that original song
[8231.74s -> 8237.27s]  that it's sort of a remix of I listened to that recently I was like oh I really liked it the
[8237.27s -> 8242.76s]  fortnight song I'm maybe I like the original song it's not even close to the same thing it's a
[8242.76s -> 8249.62s]  completely different and it's way better the victory royale song is way better than the original
[8258.70s -> 8263.50s]  whoever who owns the rights to that song I would just make that the song I'd be like holy shit you
[8263.50s -> 8271.53s]  just took what I did in it holy oh my goodness it's incredible I think this is where I die double
[8271.53s -> 8313.91s]  trouble I'm gonna lose to that swipe down tomato town my friend just got downed I revived him
[8313.91s -> 8319.35s]  we're going southbound none of the park we're going south street none of the park we're going
[8319.35s -> 8348.39s]  park street I don't I have bombs I could do it I could look only oh first try and it's matches
[8348.39s -> 8368.90s]  who cares we got up that's the best part of the whole song it's we gotta um we gotta number one
[8368.90s -> 8386.95s]  that's another good part you guys think fortnight's gonna last as long as minecraft
[8386.95s -> 8392.23s]  what do you think that it's just the thing right now I did not think fortnight was gonna stick
[8392.23s -> 8396.07s]  around I thought it was gonna be a thing that people thought was cool for a little bit but
[8396.07s -> 8409.85s]  I did not expect it to be like this really I'm not gonna blow that one up out of principle
[8409.85s -> 8421.93s]  point is gonna last forever I don't know what can it be compared to when did fortnight come out
[8421.93s -> 8429.26s]  fortnight came out and it was like plants versus zombies base building survival game it took a few
[8429.26s -> 8456.02s]  years for it to be the thing that is now 2017 2016 I wonder how much time it has left summer 2017
[8461.58s -> 8473.14s]  like tf2 started as mvm and then they added player versus player it kind of I wonder how many stock
[8473.14s -> 8481.38s]  options they gave the guy that said let's put battle royale in this I did that guy get enough
[8481.38s -> 8496.94s]  stock options to like the rest of his life to like be taken care of juicy sack sticky babies
[8500.98s -> 8523.06s]  absolutely not I got a gift card but to where where where did you get the gift card to you know
[8523.06s -> 8531.37s]  that I I gauge how much I like appreciate a gift card or not this is this is my my kind of gift
[8531.37s -> 8539.27s]  card tier list as you will so if you go into like walmart and grab like an applebee's gift card
[8540.47s -> 8552.38s]  I didn't that's in favor you just grab the first one I gauge how much I appreciate a gift card
[8552.38s -> 8557.78s]  whether or not I've been to the restaurant in five years or been to the place the like store in five
[8557.78s -> 8565.94s]  years I got I got a chili's gift card oh I haven't eaten here in probably it's seven and a half years
[8566.66s -> 8574.68s]  that was the first one on the rack that you saw at walmart at least make it at least make it a
[8574.68s -> 8585.08s]  fucking fortnight card hilly's is perfect I haven't eaten there in a long time is it good
[8586.97s -> 8591.53s]  they still do the like you can get well come with a friend and get two entrees and you get a second
[8591.53s -> 8603.37s]  entree for like five bucks or something did not do that anymore they used to do that right it was
[8603.37s -> 8608.41s]  if you were two people you could get two entrees and the second entree was like 10 bucks or
[8608.41s -> 8621.99s]  something or like eight bucks it was two for 20 yeah it was if you have two people were in the
[8621.99s -> 8645.14s]  restaurant together they could get two entrees that was applebee's right but I mean I'm sorry
[8645.14s -> 8653.46s]  applebee's fridays and chile's are the same place in my head the decor inside the menu the atmosphere
[8653.46s -> 8661.86s]  I cannot I couldn't tell you what was on what menu remember applebee's had the riblets which I loved
[8662.50s -> 8668.20s]  with these weird like square rib things and they had a little tiny not very much meat on them at
[8668.20s -> 8672.60s]  all you had to scrape your teeth on the edges to like pull off a little bit of meat they're
[8672.60s -> 8681.43s]  called riblets I don't know what the hell they were but I loved them I didn't even know what

[8717.75s -> 8728.30s]  30% of the animal doesn't exist anymore I think I think they just cut ribs in half it was these
[8728.30s -> 8736.47s]  weird they were squares they were squares connected squares riblets google it in incognito mode
[8737.19s -> 8774.95s]  come on give me something kidding me come on come on oh no I want hearts so I can keep doing

[8808.18s -> 8831.48s]  it's not enough I don't have enough range to make this work yeah oh shit Jared multiplies
[8831.48s -> 8845.02s]  everything in the room oh well damn it I could get to um give me this back I don't want the
[8845.02s -> 8859.06s]  poop poop it's not gonna be good Jarrah okay I don't want any of that stuff button ribs aka
[8859.06s -> 8866.50s]  applebee's riblets these are technically not ribs they're a thin flat strip of meat and round bone
[8866.50s -> 8872.26s]  perhaps a fourth inch thick about six inches long and one and a half inches wide cut from the sides
[8872.26s -> 8883.02s]  of boomer's spines from the behind the rearmost rib you may you've made up the last part but um
[8883.02s -> 8896.18s]  I think that's actually accurate which is not not really shit I don't like this
[8897.78s -> 8924.82s]  ah die from the poison how much damage do I have not enough abundance there's so much charging do
[8924.82s -> 8932.28s]  they okay did they buff batteries because I see them all the time now they had to have right
[8932.28s -> 8953.85s]  right am I just getting a weird rng or something there's smaller batteries that give less charge
[8955.45s -> 8962.65s]  didn't they across the board buff active items in the first place I feel like that's something
[8962.65s -> 8985.37s]  they did they did that active items are now good a lot of them weren't very good at all here's guppy
[8986.17s -> 9017.02s]  eternal life I made it I got really unnecessarily angry at that oh you're supposed to be the
[9017.02s -> 9030.95s]  easiest boss in the game make me look bad um what is this trash can thing
[9030.95s -> 9052.15s]  okay dog everybody look back compost gain more friends what I just do does it give me more
[9052.15s -> 9099.94s]  spiders whoa man this is a lot spider andy okay uh I'm gonna go down kill watch the explosions
[9101.38s -> 9123.90s]  oh come on I didn't see it on the screen no rusty I'm so rusty at Isaac I'm so much better at the
[9123.90s -> 9150.78s]  game uh that's eve I don't want it rusty crusty andy they did they did make hard mode harder to
[9150.78s -> 9157.14s]  be fair it does feel like it that's cool though it did get to a point where people playing
[9157.94s -> 9166.63s]  and just destroying every single time is this a new expansion Isaac is hard did they make it
[9166.63s -> 9175.18s]  like difficult isn't how are people reacting to it people saying I got too hard I don't want to play
[9175.18s -> 9182.44s]  it hard mode was no harder than normal mode well I mean with all the champions they added a bunch
[9182.44s -> 9189.88s]  of champions and lest um it was yeah like add these like purple and like green and blue enemies
[9189.88s -> 9194.68s]  right like champions weren't a thing that much in normal were they thought I can remember
[9206.58s -> 9213.50s]  champions yeah like the the monsters the monsters that are normal monsters but they're bigger and
[9213.50s -> 9224.49s]  green champion monsters elites or whatever you want to call them I don't know whatever those
[9224.49s -> 9244.52s]  keys oh that's what compost does okay right right okay makes sense does that gonna hurt if I touch
[9244.52s -> 9263.00s]  it gears up and yep okay and one of these champions are brighter now are they oh lord
[9268.42s -> 9282.87s]  oh all right get rid of this guy on the top left who cares about you I guess I get if I get a room
[9282.87s -> 9287.27s]  that's full of stuff I could jara and then compost and probably get a shit load of stuff
[9293.69s -> 9325.74s]  come on really mr fred he'll break off it doesn't matter stay stay stay further
[9334.92s -> 9353.91s]  you got up that looks to be new what's this super glue eye drops that seems really fast
[9353.91s -> 9370.73s]  that was a fucking disgusting boss why the tear cap got raised too did it really because I've
[9370.73s -> 9380.38s]  I've always I've always wanted that to be a thing why put a tear cap that always felt this is
[9380.38s -> 9409.02s]  infinite isn't it what we gotta just be happy that I was not streaming when that was a huge
[9409.02s -> 9414.74s]  thing that everybody was talking about for like of the for the week it came out my streams would
[9414.74s -> 9443.74s]  have been unbearable it would have been horrible did I'm not gonna cover victory royale I don't
[9443.74s -> 9464.07s]  even know what the song is called it's called chug jug with you what is jug chug jug is jug
[9464.07s -> 9476.63s]  something like a fortnight thing jug chug jug jug is I don't know what jug is

[9528.78s -> 9538.86s]  damage to do it in one revolution oh you unlock blast baby dude all right so where should I go
[9539.58s -> 9549.67s]  I don't think that no that's not new that's the thing that just flies around and if you
[9549.67s -> 9558.62s]  shoot through it right I don't want that you got the Polaroids that go up yeah I don't want
[9558.62s -> 9570.10s]  this thing tomato town you got it victory royale yeah you're about to get down 10 kills on the
[9570.10s -> 9576.95s]  board right now just wiped out tomato time like the face shakes and the eyes look up
[9582.15s -> 9617.54s]  what is oh god is there more of those hey look at this what no are you kidding me I ran right out
[9617.54s -> 9643.02s]  of there oh yeah ah oh it's because the spikes on the ground I didn't even see the spikes
[9643.02s -> 9666.65s]  oh crap what was that spawn you're so bad whatever how many victory royales have you gotten
[9667.45s -> 9684.62s]  in the last month probably not very what's this bag is this a sin heart bag
[9689.06s -> 9704.50s]  I don't really think I want this keep going I got more hearts
[9723.74s -> 9752.33s]  holy shit whoa that was cool that enemy's cool I like that new enemy eyeball did rocks I'm gonna
[9752.33s -> 9778.55s]  say down I hate these little guys weird like leech eyeball things it's so annoying super magnet it
[9778.55s -> 9787.21s]  pulls now I don't want that I want the speed like doy doy doy maybe I'll give you a doy doy doy in
[9787.21s -> 9805.43s]  like a few minutes maybe it'd be good though range is pretty bad too bad range
[9809.21s -> 9819.78s]  I'll give it to you I will but you have to be good do a chug jug chug jug doy doy have you seen
[9819.78s -> 9839.72s]  that guy before this guy's deal I don't know like a cross on his head then you want doy doy chug jug
[9839.72s -> 9849.88s]  okay
[9852.44s -> 9864.58s]  it's the best I could do all right Isaac time to die and then we go to the chest from here
[9864.58s -> 9880.71s]  whatever I have unlocked I don't know well they changed that oh did they make it so you can't
[9880.71s -> 9900.47s]  just stand in the corner and not get hit at Isaac anymore oh okay it's still there updated
[9900.47s -> 9928.62s]  animations and sounds though it looks way cooler do I have to end it here or can I keep going
[9929.26s -> 9934.31s]  if I've beaten the game on this save file like 40 times that means I probably have the chest right
[9934.87s -> 9956.41s]  I think so all right yeah oh what's this sci-fly and buoyant protector friendly ball
[9957.13s -> 9969.40s]  and I don't want that Ouija board spectral tears and Mr. Mega Jara Jara Jara Jara
[9970.20s -> 9996.07s]  rune you bastard everyone doesn't do anything oh no get away look at all this poison the poison
[9996.07s -> 10002.38s]  lasts so much longer on the ground it took hit like 10 hits I took so many hits the poison was
[10002.38s -> 10028.18s]  lasting so long that's new it doesn't usually last that long what you could have had eight items so
[10028.18s -> 10034.34s]  with Jara counts for chest I thought it was only consumable is any physical item in the game is
[10034.34s -> 10045.70s]  that new I thought Jara was just like consumable it's consumables and chests
[10046.50s -> 10055.14s]  what I thought it was just like coins bombs cards oh shit as long as the chest is closed
[10055.14s -> 10066.95s]  oh all right I didn't know that hate not knowing how much health I have that sucks
[10095.59s -> 10108.52s]  how many of you are in this room come on I already
[10117.06s -> 10128.28s]  oh what was that what was that it was like a drink it or something I don't know it's gone
[10128.28s -> 10161.21s]  whatever it is do more shoe something like that right got it never seen this guy before this new
[10161.21s -> 10194.92s]  enemy oh Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron run away Aaron the fact that half of you guys have no idea what
[10194.92s -> 10219.74s]  that is it makes it even funnier for me is Aaron I'm not even gonna talk about it just whatever
[10219.74s -> 10245.06s]  fucking let me play the game I spent $15 on by the way I spent $15 on this hey did you miss me
[10245.06s -> 10267.67s]  hey did you miss me didn't even take one damage that for like five minutes oh don't
[10268.47s -> 10289.18s]  watch out these bugs these bugs are dangerous I've been waiting for you to say this please just say it
[10289.74s -> 10305.59s]  why have I ever made like a reference to that oh shit this is bad this is very bad
[10305.59s -> 10318.74s]  I'm gonna go one of you's gotta go please one of you's got to keep you waiting huh
[10319.54s -> 10326.47s]  that was for that one person I don't care it was really bad that was really bad but I did it for
[10326.47s -> 10333.18s]  that one person that I mean they probably hated it too whatever it was just for that one person
[10333.26s -> 10337.91s]  and they wanted me to do like a sonic uh snake that's sonic the hedgehog
[10344.41s -> 10353.64s]  kill him before he runs at you they both in the same smash brothers universe
[10354.36s -> 10395.27s]  fuck oh oh I think this is the end oh omega large hp up okay I need to collect as many hearts as I
[10395.27s -> 10415.05s]  can here what's the boss even here is a blue baby I honestly don't even know and I might as
[10415.05s -> 10438.06s]  well look for the secret rooms okay oh whatever I'm just gonna go for it if I lose I lose that's
[10438.06s -> 10445.35s]  all I've been it's I'm kind of rusty I haven't played Isaac in a while and they made hard mode
[10445.35s -> 10448.87s]  harder so it's like the game is actually way harder for me because I haven't played in a while
[10449.59s -> 10461.83s]  and I'm used to it being a little easier so that's Mike's yeah it was burped pain versus
[10462.63s -> 10502.98s]  blue baby shielded tears are very good remember didn't didn't I try to play beat the hush on
[10502.98s -> 10508.23s]  screen one time I beat the hush like twice or three times ever did it once on screen it's you
[10508.23s -> 10514.82s]  don't you have to have a stupid build to even try and if you don't have a build that's absolutely
[10514.82s -> 10536.87s]  just dumb you just just quit right that's what I remember I did it yay yay yay yay yabby j yay
[10536.87s -> 10557.08s]  I've done it again I did that like a month ago are you sitting in your own poop right now
[10561.16s -> 10572.78s]  um why don't we check I'm gonna I'm gonna get up and sit down really quickly and we'll see
[10572.78s -> 10577.46s]  I'm gonna sit up I'm standing and sitting down I don't think so let's try it again
[10578.66s -> 10597.75s]  oh I don't feel it doesn't feel weird all right cool let's go again uh I have to beat I must have
[10597.75s -> 10604.50s]  the voice too bad uh let's do Lazarus let me try to get to mom's heart in 30 minutes I mean no

[10620.63s -> 10638.68s]  Lazarus my my ostosis forget me not I don't know what that does I thought that was a legitimate
[10638.68s -> 10644.71s]  mistake for a second no you you die as Lazarus you come back you get the stat increases you
[10644.71s -> 10670.04s]  use the pill and if the pill is bad you restart the game it's the Lazarus strat who knew this
[10670.04s -> 10689.22s]  would be a diaper stream every stream is a diaper stream what are you guys saying even the carnival
[10691.50s -> 10737.27s]  yeah oh let me show you the uh Samson strat my favorite character in the game is Samson
[10737.27s -> 10747.85s]  I find it to be the most fun bad strat what do you even know have you ever played Binding
[10747.85s -> 10756.18s]  of Isaac I bet I bet you you haven't the Dio I think this just rerolls it uh consumables
[10759.40s -> 10800.07s]  not a great start not a great start too worse that guy's huge repentance guy's huge come on
[10800.07s -> 10813.74s]  worry I mean you seem this guy seems off I mean like in general you mean today I don't know I
[10813.74s -> 10819.72s]  think I feel okay right now I'm on I think I think I'm on what would you consider off
[10828.02s -> 10843.91s]  on CBD no not right now you're not knocked that away he doesn't want to play this game
[10845.42s -> 10851.74s]  I really I really do actually I've been looking forward to this update for since it was announced
[10851.74s -> 10878.38s]  like two years ago or something the image and range up I like it oh no it's only one eye though
[10878.38s -> 10885.02s]  I had this item sucks after all that Santa talk you probably you have to be high on something
[10885.58s -> 10916.04s]  I don't think so I don't have the curse again oh nice five cents wait what if I
[10917.00s -> 10938.12s]  I could roll what I just do hey what does this even do I thought it rerolled consumables it
[10938.12s -> 10948.81s]  rerolls enemies uh okay and yeah you don't want to do that until the last floors if you do it here
[10949.53s -> 10965.38s]  you could get end game enemies and die instantly I saw it don't worry I'll go get it later in the
[10965.38s -> 10973.02s]  game Peter it's funny that's that's just a I can just say that and you guys will say end game Peter
[10973.02s -> 10995.56s]  like somebody will even if it's only one of you I really like that I want it disappointing I don't
[10995.56s -> 11000.90s]  like getting little Gish it's always a disappointment when you see his face tell me I'm wrong tell me I'm
[11000.90s -> 11014.76s]  wrong when you see that little Gish you don't go and want to restart I'm just telling you
[11026.25s -> 11048.12s]  all right let's see what we got good for Samson all right that's enough I think I'm at max
[11048.76s -> 11057.54s]  little Gish saved my run before um I'd rather have passive stats I'm a passive stat kind of
[11057.54s -> 11063.06s]  guy in Isaac I don't really like the familiars that can be cool but I like having interesting
[11063.06s -> 11066.66s]  passive stat combinations I don't really like the active items I don't really like the
[11067.30s -> 11077.14s]  friends like the passive items and that's it don't make me don't let me forget the red heart
[11082.49s -> 11090.95s]  imagine if you can reroll bosses I hiccuped after that that was not like a fake laugh or anything
[11090.95s -> 11112.10s]  what is this consolation prize plus one to the lowest stat no it's kind of terrible it's really
[11112.10s -> 11136.25s]  bad um I have money I don't want that what's this um purple saddle thing do get them both I can't
[11139.45s -> 11145.85s]  everyone doubles card effects oh wow that's actually really good I don't think I can get
[11145.85s -> 11169.35s]  both though arrow cloth temperance nice I need that how do I get that what do you mean wasted
[11169.35s -> 11173.78s]  there could have been coins in there and make me allowed to buy the card thing all right I
[11173.78s -> 11209.62s]  could pick this up and they could be two pennies in it how much health do I have all right I get it
[11212.76s -> 11229.14s]  double card effects incoming judgment times two is the little guy right judgments the coin bum
[11229.14s -> 11239.80s]  well I get two judgments that's a pretty cool build anything else I can get the eternal heart
[11239.80s -> 11262.86s]  where was that over here d d 10 some of the two judgments versus satan that do anything
[11265.74s -> 11271.86s]  you're so broke now with no bombs or keys I don't think that matters though if I can get good cards
[11271.86s -> 11279.70s]  if I can get like the hierophant once or I can it's been awesome look at this already I'm good
[11280.34s -> 11306.58s]  do a satan voice no you do it satan face yeah I hate when games do satan faces scary

[11363.19s -> 11376.46s]  the movie has to pause like if you want to do if you want to do like a Jim Carrey impression while
[11376.46s -> 11383.80s]  we're watching ace ventura I gotta pause the movie god damn it that was a cool build too
[11395.56s -> 11402.98s]  pause Shrek stop getting hit no I'm doing it on purpose oh shit he's doing it on purpose
[11404.15s -> 11409.77s]  he's doing this on purpose finally we figured it out we got him he admitted it
[11418.10s -> 11429.70s]  don't ever pause Shrek hey you know they're like what was the last time you heard it Shrek is like
[11429.70s -> 11440.62s]  on the way out isn't he it hasn't been like a movie in a while like he's Shrek's kind of on the way
[11440.62s -> 11465.13s]  out he's losing I think popularity I'm not sure he's in with the kids now good key how fucking dare
[11465.13s -> 11470.49s]  you I know I love Shrek I love Shrek I'm just saying I think he might think he's I don't think
[11470.49s -> 11476.09s]  he's as popular as everybody thinks he is now he's lost a lot to fortnight I'm sorry
[11476.09s -> 11505.10s]  reusable knockback he has though if I'm honest he deserved it but you don't you don't like Shrek
[11505.10s -> 11526.92s]  what's your problem with Shrek I can't knock that up well let's go Samson versus the hunt
[11527.48s -> 11547.82s]  all right no more fucking around okay good good good good go go go go go dog food HP up move
[11547.82s -> 11559.10s]  wasn't their whole thing with people thought Peter Griffin was gonna be in fortnight it was a huge
[11559.10s -> 11573.80s]  deal what ever happened with that yeah people on Twitter it was like trending on Twitter that Peter
[11573.80s -> 11595.78s]  Griffin was gonna be in fortnight I'm not making this up I swear to god are we on the same planet
[11595.78s -> 11611.13s]  here that was a huge thing people were talking about I feel like with family guy I feel like
[11612.44s -> 11619.34s]  is the tide moving on family guy like especially Peter Griffin I think we brought this up briefly
[11619.34s -> 11625.58s]  before but everybody family guy came out everybody thought it was really funny it got cancelled people
[11625.58s -> 11630.70s]  begged to have it brought back they brought it back it was around for way too long it became like
[11630.70s -> 11636.78s]  really sort of trying too hard and unfunny like and then everybody knew that started talking shit
[11636.78s -> 11640.94s]  about family guy and then all of a sudden like the last few years Peter Griffin is now like funny
[11641.50s -> 11648.38s]  not Peter Griffin and family guy Peter Griffin just the guy is funny not Peter Griffin family
[11648.38s -> 11663.35s]  guy Peter Griffin did it flip is it that's ironic okay like the people that think Peter
[11663.35s -> 11668.17s]  Griffin is funny right now they're they don't watch family guy they just think that Peter
[11668.25s -> 11672.01s]  Griffin going like holy crap Lois I gotta get out of here and it's like a meme right
[11672.73s -> 11695.51s]  why did I take that I don't know this is cool holy crap Lois it's funny because he's not funny oh
[11695.51s -> 11701.51s]  okay I get it I know I genuinely think that Peter Griffin is funny but family guy is bad okay well
[11701.51s -> 11723.06s]  that's some more data we have now I wonder how many of you there are I only laugh at family guy not
[11723.06s -> 11734.06s]  with family guy I think this is a good combo with the orbiting tears well if I just would stop
[11734.06s -> 11759.00s]  speaking I would rather have Peter Griffin and Smash Brothers I'm not picking that thing up I'm
[11759.00s -> 11780.90s]  getting this oh what a stupid car to get hurt for who's fallen further from grace family guy
[11780.90s -> 11791.51s]  Simpsons or South Park um I don't know I don't think it's South Park it's probably the Simpsons
[11799.35s -> 11808.12s]  yeah it probably is the Simpsons I'm in trouble now did I check this wall I'm in trouble all right
[11808.12s -> 11832.81s]  I have to pay attention I'm no talking about Simpsons and shit here we go box of stuff again
[11842.39s -> 11849.56s]  yeah I don't um I don't know if the Simpsons is particularly like a worse show than the other two
[11849.56s -> 11856.02s]  but it feels like is it weird for me to say that like canceling the Simpsons
[11856.74s -> 11864.49s]  it's just like you can't it has to be on tv if the Simpsons is off of television and old
[11864.49s -> 11868.65s]  gods are gonna rise up from the fucking earth's crust and kill us all it has to be part of that
[11868.65s -> 11888.17s]  has to be why it hasn't been 30 something years I'm gonna keep the poop it must always be a
[11888.17s -> 11906.34s]  Simpsons it must always be a lich king and honestly I can't I can't even speak very much
[11906.34s -> 11911.26s]  to what I'm even saying oh the Simpsons isn't good anymore I feel like all of us say that but
[11911.26s -> 11915.83s]  when was the last time you watched an episode of the Simpsons I think all of us just assume the
[11915.83s -> 11921.11s]  Simpsons is bad and none of us have watched the show does any no but I don't think anyone watches
[11921.11s -> 11927.48s]  the show they just air I don't think people actually watch the show it just airs and everyone
[11927.48s -> 11937.43s]  just goes I don't think the Simpsons is good anymore I don't who's catching brand new episodes
[11937.43s -> 11942.47s]  of the Simpsons when they go on Fox oh it's on Fox the Simpsons it's not on Netflix or anything
[11943.51s -> 11951.85s]  it's on fucking old-ass like cable tv and how many people have that still not on like Hulu is it
[11952.57s -> 11964.68s]  is it on Hulu are new episodes airing on Hulu though they might have seasons but are new episodes
[11964.68s -> 11974.02s]  airing somewhere like on a week-to-week basis it's on Disney plus why on Disney plus but it's it's
[11974.02s -> 11987.96s]  a week-to-week basis the newest episode is about Homer learning the floss okay yeah but like they
[11987.96s -> 11993.16s]  can't I get what people say here where it's like oh my god it's about Homer and like doing the floss
[11993.16s -> 11997.80s]  and fortnight they can't just have every episode about him working at like a nuclear power plant
[11998.44s -> 12006.79s]  and like him reading newspapers and shit and strangling Bart yeah they have to be they have
[12006.79s -> 12011.27s]  to have some type of yeah they're gonna do something it can't just be the same thing every
[12011.27s -> 12026.74s]  time why not because it's been on for 30 years this was a horrible idea by the way to take this
[12026.74s -> 12043.96s]  you guys are right which is why they should just take it off they have to end it soon well they've
[12043.96s -> 12051.37s]  already broken the seven-year rule it's been broken any show that is on the air for longer than
[12051.37s -> 12062.15s]  seven seasons is not good anymore as as of the eighth season every time it is the ultimate
[12062.15s -> 12075.40s]  Seinfeld rule when a show goes past seven years it's not as good anymore now there are some
[12075.40s -> 12085.03s]  exceptions there are there are some exceptions but in a 95 percent of the time scenario more than
[12085.03s -> 12094.98s]  seven plus years of a tv show it starts to get a little tiring and what always sunny yeah but I
[12094.98s -> 12103.93s]  said there are exceptions that's like a god show how many years have I been on yep okay this is
[12104.89s -> 12111.99s]  season 10 of German 985 well no no no no no that's not fair I would say this is season like six
[12112.63s -> 12119.99s]  really season five maybe because when I was on YouTube I did my first like two years a year or
[12119.99s -> 12124.07s]  two on YouTube I was like experimenting with stuff trying to like see what I wanted to do
[12124.07s -> 12132.73s]  like the real German 985 the streamer guy the youtuber guy was like 2012 2013 I was making
[12132.73s -> 12139.34s]  pilots for a year and a half to come this is a year like six next year we'll see if you guys
[12139.34s -> 12150.36s]  still think this show's any good the seasons are arcs this is the current like this is currently
[12150.36s -> 12165.45s]  arc number four yeah I mean that sounds kind of accurate I feel the same way about a lot of movie
[12165.45s -> 12171.69s]  franchises too and here hear me out here once a show or a movie gets to be a point where it's
[12171.69s -> 12179.53s]  like more than 10 on 20 plus years going all the actors feel like they are doing parodies and
[12179.53s -> 12188.41s]  impressions of themselves it's not the character it's like the actor doing the impression of the
[12188.41s -> 12193.91s]  character perfect example is like when Johnny Depp was in the last part of the Caribbean movie
[12194.63s -> 12201.11s]  I saw it and it was like this is not Captain Jack Sparrow this is Johnny Depp in a costume
[12201.67s -> 12212.01s]  doing Captain Jack Sparrow once you cross a certain amount of time and a certain amount of I guess
[12212.01s -> 12216.33s]  age for actors and stuff it's just like it's almost it becomes like a parody of itself
[12217.13s -> 12227.80s]  and I can't suspend my disbelief anymore Johnny Depp in a costume
[12227.80s -> 12238.87s]  fucking Jack Sparrow wait was that what I said what did I say what did I say is that that's not
[12238.87s -> 12255.53s]  what I said right is how I worded it how did I say it it was the phrasing I don't think I said it
[12255.53s -> 12266.22s]  like that though how this is why you can tell I don't look at the screen there's your proof that
[12266.22s -> 12270.62s]  I sometimes just don't even look at the screen I'm looking at you this is the worst item in the game
[12270.62s -> 12283.67s]  did they buff it did they buff the worst active item in the game they did really is it better
[12283.67s -> 12300.38s]  now holy shit that's now the best item in the game are you kidding me that thing was so awful
[12300.38s -> 12316.81s]  before this game oh yep thank you hey man I can't get this stuff I don't want the robes you know I
[12316.81s -> 12331.08s]  have one heart you don't you have too much confidence in my ability you didn't take the
[12331.08s -> 12334.92s]  robes you know I don't want it robes give black hearts yeah and they never come back
[12335.64s -> 12339.00s]  and I'm gonna lose them you know me you've watched me play games before I'm not gonna
[12339.00s -> 12353.22s]  have three black hearts forever they're gonna go away any tears up I would solve every one of
[12353.22s -> 12363.58s]  my problems right here how the run spin uh the last one was all right the save file it does not
[12363.58s -> 12368.73s]  have I haven't beaten the hush three times on this save file so probably not gonna do that so I'm
[12368.73s -> 12372.73s]  probably gonna get a new save file I'm probably gonna talk like this I guess for some reason
[12373.53s -> 12386.78s]  what is putting out the fires do the fires sometimes a coin will be in them
[12387.50s -> 12400.66s]  sometimes a couple hits not from the big guy because it's a full heart does it are not Isaac
[12400.66s -> 12406.58s]  pros like me probably didn't know that if a champion hits you it is one full heart not half
[12406.58s -> 12413.75s]  a heart it's just it's absolute dog shit game design dog it's awful fucking video game design
[12413.75s -> 12427.14s]  is it I'm just kidding pretty good it's actually pretty good design if you think about being so
[12427.14s -> 12435.21s]  angry at the game face cam no I don't close on I never do I don't think I'm gonna kill these guys
[12449.70s -> 12478.81s]  I please die it's the equivalent of hitting a foul ball every pitch can something happen please

[13219.50s -> 13226.62s]  fight the dinosaurs we could side scrolling beat him up with two players what they were the cavemen
[13226.62s -> 13230.94s]  and when you hit the caveman with club you had a melee weapon for a club it would make the sound
[13231.50s -> 13240.81s]  and it was like what what what what what what what what what did I get it right what does five do

[13690.98s -> 13709.51s]  oh diamonds oh what's what's a double of 90 oh okay thanks horrible super secret room five
[13709.51s -> 13724.47s]  every same one okay we've done all those why am I exploding every single room because uh there
[13724.47s -> 13729.35s]  could be items in a bunch of these rocks and secret walls and secret rooms and I'm able to
[13729.35s -> 13736.28s]  do this and walk around like this and move like this I don't need to do every single one of them
[13736.28s -> 13758.73s]  but you know enough of them no that was annoying the germa show used to be so good yeah now he's
[13758.73s -> 13764.15s]  just like out there it's like season eight season nine it was like funny for a while
[13764.15s -> 13768.47s]  but just like I don't know I just like feel like he's doing kind of a parody of himself
[13769.11s -> 13775.35s]  he's doing like the goku voice like I remember when he did that it was funny but now he's like
[13775.35s -> 13779.83s]  doing it all the time and it's like he's using it as a way to kind of crutch or something to
[13779.91s -> 13803.82s]  comedic purposes I don't know what's he doing get off me the hermit thank you
[13803.82s -> 13813.45s]  oh everything is free don't take that right no that thing that thing sucks I remember that
[13813.45s -> 13825.50s]  thing is horrible doesn't that if you take damage you teleport out of the room right that's not what
[13825.50s -> 13833.37s]  this one is it recharges an item on hit okay I was okay all right all right I thought this was the
[13833.37s -> 13836.65s]  thing that when you take damage you teleport out that's the worst item probably in the whole game
[13836.65s -> 13852.66s]  the cursed eye oh what is this dead eye accuracy brings power that's not gonna happen
[13855.21s -> 13867.90s]  this is the most inaccurate you can probably be although it lasts
[13870.09s -> 13894.63s]  I don't know I think it's working it looks really cool though I don't want the monkey paw get in
[13894.63s -> 13902.76s]  there I need tears up so bad this looks awesome what a cool looking build what happened to that
[13902.76s -> 13914.06s]  why did that hit me it's weird I forget to use the active right right right yeah I'm holding
[13914.06s -> 13925.21s]  on to it because I'm scared I'm not gonna have it for the boss you gotta be concentrated or
[13925.21s -> 13928.97s]  otherwise it's not very good I'm gonna burp hopefully not directly into your face
[13936.74s -> 13952.34s]  how many hours do you have in the game well in total probably five or six hundred
[13953.64s -> 13961.91s]  but there's a big but here it's like five or six hundred hours the problem is oh this is actually
[13961.91s -> 13973.45s]  kind of uh the problem is it's like five or six hundred hours over the course of almost 10 years
[13974.73s -> 13979.93s]  I play the game for a few months and then I stop playing for a year and then so then I forget every
[13979.93s -> 13985.21s]  single thing that's in the game and I start over again I've done that for the last probably seven
[13985.21s -> 13999.32s]  straight years I have restarted save files across different consoles I have a file on my switch
[13999.32s -> 14005.80s]  right now I've played a ton of Isaac on switch I have almost all the unlockables but this is
[14005.80s -> 14011.35s]  not for switch yet I would have played it on the switch and been ready to go but I'm seeing a lot
[14011.35s -> 14019.38s]  of stuff I didn't see in the other one that I played yeah I played usually uh but yeah this
[14019.38s -> 14029.86s]  is a big but how are you so bad at the game um I don't know I mean like I just told you I don't I
[14029.86s -> 14036.06s]  pick up the game and I play it for like a week or two and then I don't play it for like a year or
[14036.06s -> 14043.64s]  two and then I start over again it's I'm like I'm fresh starting the game again for the first time
[14046.57s -> 14053.94s]  it's all muscle memory and repetition guys yeah if I had played Isaac for like a year straight I'm
[14053.94s -> 14077.45s]  sure I'd be phenomenal why did I go in here I really don't like that room all right watch the
[14077.45s -> 14095.40s]  health here um no all jokes aside what's the best thing you've ever seen me do in a video game
[14095.40s -> 14101.27s]  no messing around no like oh yeah when you uh Jevil first try what what opportunity have you
[14101.27s -> 14112.54s]  ever seen where I did something that was unbelievable what was it how many of those have I had
[14112.54s -> 14137.02s]  it was probably Jevil it honestly unironically was Jevil what the fuck laying through Simpsons
[14137.02s -> 14154.22s]  hit and run I don't think so okay let's keep moving this way it was beating Jump King uh
[14155.26s -> 14162.84s]  I feel like that was not that game was a horrible pain in the ass right but I don't know if that
[14162.84s -> 14171.32s]  sits up there with oh my god that was the best thing ever a lot of people beat Jump King not a
[14171.32s -> 14184.36s]  lot of people be Jevil first try I know you did but a bunch of other people didn't oh friend zone

[14194.63s -> 14215.56s]  the Ouija board that's it I got spectral tears they're gonna go through everything wait spectral
[14215.56s -> 14224.42s]  does not go through that's piercing I got that wrong oh that's right they don't phase through
[14224.42s -> 14238.90s]  they it's not piercing shit I thought it was I already had spectral god damn it I thought that
[14238.90s -> 14246.97s]  spectral tears meant that they passed phase through it's piercing like the color is still good
[14246.97s -> 14266.92s]  but it's uh let's go oh no it's Guppy's head this counts that I picked it up right I just have to
[14266.92s -> 14288.86s]  pick it up from my understanding Guppy yes the guy called this guy the Guppy Cruncha it's better

[14368.22s -> 14373.50s]  overlook the can't the game could be a 10 out of 10 game and it could be my favorite video game
[14373.50s -> 14380.94s]  ever made gameplay wise I think I don't like the camera I wish I could zoom the camera out another
[14380.94s -> 14388.57s]  20 30 percent I don't like the angle of the camera and I don't like how close it is even at max zoom
[14388.57s -> 14392.68s]  it's not far enough it's the only thing that's keeping me back from playing the game and I've
[14392.68s -> 14400.12s]  tried to play it more than twice so I'm not just bullshitting you here I've tried to play what is

[14983.72s -> 14999.72s]  this room's terrible not going this way you know when I killed mega Satan on stream and I had this
[14999.72s -> 15004.25s]  thing that just blew up the screen every half second that was really cool I guess remember
[15004.25s -> 15011.51s]  that season it was a really cool episode of that season let's just do the thing that shows do where
[15011.51s -> 15028.73s]  they just tell you to remember how cool the show was how cool that was this is the clip show season
[15029.45s -> 15042.06s]  these are new what are these oh my god what the fuck just happened I look I put the bomb
[15042.06s -> 15072.94s]  and walked over and looked at Chad because I thought it was safe I have 99 coins no
[15084.31s -> 15110.78s]  oh it's not over yet not yet almost now it is I'm gonna die what is that flat penny this is
[15115.24s -> 15124.66s]  not worth it it's the part where the streamer pretends to not know how to play and lose a 56
[15124.66s -> 15156.47s]  minute run okay okay I'm probably gonna die here though because this stuff's all new and scary
[15156.47s -> 15162.81s]  and they made hard mode way harder you didn't tell me that I know some steam store page what
[15162.81s -> 15219.51s]  the heck banana crew I mean drew crew oh I'm dead we get my build was cool yeah but it was
[15219.51s -> 15226.84s]  never gonna work out it was cool to look at I needed more tears I needed more damage it was
[15226.84s -> 15238.22s]  cool and I need to it was cool to look at though uh slowing enemies down nice cool I'm just going
[15238.22s -> 15266.79s]  for it let's go I'm getting to the hush and I'm gonna beat hush right now oh that's new that's new
[15266.79s -> 15288.65s]  that bug is named in the first game excellence it sounds like our real monsters that sounds like
[15289.21s -> 15306.81s]  just just background music in our real monsters that was weird all right where's that it's a candle
[15306.81s -> 15320.55s]  don't want it hurry up smells like up gamer in here what's up dude how you been I hope you're
[15320.55s -> 15350.04s]  doing well it was um there it is really hurry up don't bother with the secret room just move

[15368.04s -> 15390.07s]  not coming back down here for any reason you're not beating the hush yet I I don't think I have
[15390.07s -> 15401.18s]  on this save file maybe once you can you can check right isn't there a way to check which is which
[15401.18s -> 15410.82s]  is the hutch it's like the three dots right oh that's delirium joker card hell yeah fat protector
[15410.82s -> 15445.64s]  that's pretty good or use joker now give me this stars item room don't want it you still have a
[15445.64s -> 15454.25s]  hundred percent devil deal chance that's right just do the joker now it can take me to like that
[15454.25s -> 15482.07s]  weird error room right I wonder remember save it for caves one okay I'm gonna hold on to the joker
[15482.07s -> 15517.00s]  does the fact I do anything besides just block damage or is it just a huge fat guy it blocks
[15517.00s -> 15526.78s]  and does a little damage okay cool I gotta try to get to hush oh I've definitely beaten hush I know
[15526.78s -> 15540.81s]  I have at least a few times on this file I think our soap tears and shots beat up all right nice
[15540.81s -> 15552.22s]  wait I don't want to leave just yet should I just go I gotta go I gotta go we gotta move use the
[15552.22s -> 15582.15s]  joker now use it now oh that's dark bum that guy's awesome they nerfed him what do you mean they
[15582.15s -> 15595.91s]  nerfed him oh hey he's shitty now no he's not what did they do he was good like three years ago
[15596.87s -> 15618.09s]  really he sucks now counterfeit penny wealth of wealth I'll keep it I'm gonna go down drops lots
[15618.09s -> 15629.83s]  of stuff now instead of soul hearts oh whatever I remember a really cool run was if you had little
[15629.83s -> 15635.03s]  chad and dark bum it was just never ending soul hearts it was awesome why'd I go in this room
[15635.83s -> 15648.10s]  still a 40 chance for a black heart okay I am not dealing with this right now
[15648.98s -> 15665.24s]  hellum please huge huge room
[15670.10s -> 15688.47s]  double items though that's good so let's talk about something really quickly on the next stream so
[15688.47s -> 15695.75s]  remember we're gonna we're trying this new thing here I am going to play I'm gonna try to get the
[15695.75s -> 15701.91s]  sims one ready for next week if you I gotta say it one more time I'm gonna say it for the third
[15701.91s -> 15710.73s]  time just to make sure everyone hears it I'm going to be streaming at the same point at the
[15710.73s -> 15718.31s]  same time on the same day once a week with an option for a second day in a row that's sort of
[15718.31s -> 15723.69s]  how it's going to be for a while and even maybe even long term if you missed out with all the
[15723.69s -> 15730.73s]  updates but it will be on schedule scheduled streams are coming back no longer just up in
[15730.73s -> 15736.55s]  the air randomly in the afternoon pacific you will know exactly precisely every time when the
[15736.55s -> 15747.11s]  stream is going to happen and this is kind of weird hold on try pac-man 99 yeah pack that actually
[15747.11s -> 15773.26s]  looks awesome two bombs to blow that up right and I will have a lot more information about grotto
[15773.26s -> 15780.26s]  beasts over the next couple of streams you'll hear me talk way more about it just wanted to
[15780.26s -> 15792.18s]  make sure you know that that's a real thing oh god what does this do this recharges you can blow
[15792.18s -> 15816.76s]  the bottom up right oh fuck I thought it took you to that room with the item I thought it took you
[15816.76s -> 15827.18s]  down that ladder with the there's an item at the bottom oh it's only if there's a ladder on it
[15830.07s -> 15835.35s]  like but the games like okay binding of Isaac may as well be a physics textbook by now okay there's
[15835.35s -> 15852.25s]  like a thousand items there's like 400 room combinations I I'm sorry shit and then I just
[15852.25s -> 15868.90s]  deleted like four items this is a dead run now fuck I'm so mad right now oh I want to greed mode
[15868.90s -> 15885.27s]  with somebody I love greed mode it's like my favorite range and luck up now I'm used to
[15885.27s -> 15891.19s]  when I was playing on the switch greedier mode so this this should be easier for me considering
[15891.19s -> 15899.54s]  the last time I played this it was greedier greedier only greedier so I should be okay here
[15899.54s -> 15912.54s]  when's the cat boy stream now that is a great question one that I will refuse to answer
[15913.34s -> 15919.00s]  but I will say it was a very nice question and I will move on as if you never asked it
[15942.50s -> 15954.57s]  yeah but no in all seriousness you'll see it at some point soon that's probably the next quote
[15956.12s -> 15965.19s]  more elaborate stream that you'll see it's probably the next one my god you get so many
[15965.19s -> 15979.50s]  more coins in the regular greed mode it's insane what about the bionicle movie that's just not
[15979.50s -> 16007.18s]  that's not gonna happen there's no chance in hell the items kind of suck what is this eyesore
[16007.18s -> 16017.59s]  so it just randomly shoots in a bunch of directions sometimes all right that's pretty
[16017.59s -> 16029.74s]  cool you get so much more time too isn't it like 10 seconds or 12 seconds in greedier
[16030.30s -> 16067.05s]  this is so much easier itchy nose what did I do I'm dodging it too much god have I got hit
[16067.05s -> 16087.40s]  that many times in a row nightmare mode go I'm actually gonna die like the poop guy it's like
[16087.40s -> 16123.27s]  giant a pinwheel okay what is it I don't want that thing it's two hearts it's too much to take
[16123.83s -> 16136.94s]  well you just fuck off already get out of here rotten baby is good you get a demon heart take
[16136.94s -> 16143.72s]  the pact get it it gives you black hearts does this guy serious take it take both act will give
[16143.72s -> 16152.86s]  you hearts take it yeah but I have to take damage as Samson let's hope that's part of the deal
[16153.66s -> 16211.58s]  oh new new deal no no deal Samson Samson this is such a great game oh intensifying tears what
[16211.58s -> 16217.40s]  does it anyone know what that is I've gotten that twice I don't know what it is intensifying tears
[16218.12s -> 16241.03s]  you keep shooting in one direction in one direction oh okay it takes so I have to just
[16241.03s -> 16252.76s]  hold it here in one direction to just spam holy shit this is awesome although I can never stop
[16252.76s -> 16267.35s]  shooting left okay what do we got in here cat food maybe I'll get the cat food anything left
[16267.35s -> 16300.25s]  or right is better we'll get it up there pretty cool I'm just machine gun that it can only fire
[16300.25s -> 16335.96s]  in one direction okay they're really inaccurate though come on shoot behind hi whoa whoa what are
[16335.96s -> 16354.41s]  these I've never seen that guy before I don't think all right tuna supper HP up tears up I
[16358.57s -> 16374.89s]  can't go faster than that I'm at the cap right now I thought I could go past this the button
[16374.89s -> 16391.69s]  is the fastest you can what just happened why is there not a delay on being able to press that
[16391.69s -> 16397.24s]  button when you step on that button you shouldn't be able to step on it again for like two seconds
[16397.24s -> 16426.39s]  at least that's good for this guy baby proof the game no no it should be like a half second or
[16426.39s -> 16439.11s]  it's in one second or something you know how many times I've accidentally stepped on something like
[16439.11s -> 16453.86s]  that you have to you just don't refuse to admit you do very secret door open that happens to you
[16453.86s -> 16467.58s]  once a day once a week well that was not worth even doing the nightmare room um hmm let's get
[16467.58s -> 16491.96s]  it go are you alive yes I am the mulligan is this the thing that makes spiders um flies just come
[16491.96s -> 16499.75s]  out of me while I shoot because if it is that's ridiculous that should be an insane build now
[16505.78s -> 16538.14s]  stapler stapler sauce imposter guy are you you are yes me one autograph cool uh it was his passage
[16538.14s -> 16551.62s]  so it was his passage and it's two it was what do I do I think this just goes down to the next floor
[16551.62s -> 16597.13s]  right you can spawn a ladder or a trap door it's a trap door give me a ladder what the fuck all right
[16597.13s -> 16604.71s]  let's see how good this mulligan works I am super excited everything of down I'm gonna go let's do
[16604.71s -> 16619.37s]  down why did he abandon the first German channel that's season one season two is see this season
[16619.37s -> 16626.49s]  one season one through three is on that channel seasons four or six are on twitch and second
[16626.49s -> 16637.54s]  germo these are different DVDs there's a separate DVDs you can't fit every season on one DVD remember
[16637.54s -> 16655.51s]  you used to have to buy like 10 DVDs get these flies oh yeah I didn't even know they existed
[16666.28s -> 16673.64s]  I had to do it I feel like I can hit horizontally better than I can hit vertically
[16673.64s -> 16719.27s]  anybody else feel like that come on let's go ah come on oh come on hi vertical hits are hard
[16719.27s -> 16739.51s]  to line up yeah they are let's see what about this pink um eraser thing it's doi throw it
[16739.51s -> 16761.34s]  and erases one enemy from the run hmm I think I want to reroll this whole thing oh very nice
[16761.74s -> 16774.50s]  stapler stapler no the state doesn't the stapler make you only shoot half of half shots it's
[16774.50s -> 16777.70s]  literally the worst play I've ever seen I thought the stapler means you only shoot out of one eye
[16778.26s -> 16807.46s]  it's just damage up it doesn't it doesn't staplers new don't be mean to me let the
[16807.46s -> 16819.03s]  coal I don't think the coal will be any good here leave him alone he's having fun all right time for

[19498.42s -> 19508.63s]  that doesn't matter is this I think there's a certain amount that can be on screen
[19509.35s -> 19533.16s]  because I think I'm replacing them why would there be a cap and how is this a challenge this
[19533.16s -> 19557.96s]  is very easy am I missing something here it's just fun it kind of is just fun cool all right

[19650.33s -> 19663.19s]  trial here to see how that plays out I didn't feed once forgot to pee once the whole day
[19664.86s -> 19688.90s]  oh it's pretty rare get him is this the season finale it's not the season finale
[19689.70s -> 19712.25s]  did you not notice did you pee yourself no I'm good doesn't look like it we're good what do you
[19712.25s -> 19733.45s]  unlock for doing this because you unlock items this way right I don't even care about the items
[19733.45s -> 19748.20s]  I don't even care about getting any uh any money or anything I just want to get to mom max poops
[19748.20s -> 19771.43s]  are determined by your range stat okay but it's uh it's good to be back it's good to uh see you
[19771.43s -> 19780.01s]  all again I will not be taking another break like that ever again we're gonna change up how we do
[19780.01s -> 19798.41s]  things on the channel so let's see what happens the idea is having the kind of weekly show in
[19798.41s -> 19803.06s]  quotes will make it so I don't have to ever do that again because I really don't want to do that
[19803.06s -> 19823.19s]  again just get them power twice can't wait for the next month break in June and that would be
[19823.19s -> 19847.78s]  something now wouldn't it I don't even buy that wait can I not kill these how do I kill these
[19847.78s -> 19883.67s]  I have to use bombs I'm gonna say holy that's not good all right only one more HP up wrap take any
[19883.67s -> 19893.70s]  break you need man we can handle it I know and I have I disappeared for like three months back
[19893.70s -> 19903.74s]  in last year and then here we are again I disappeared for like a month again like less
[19903.74s -> 19909.43s]  than probably about a year later I really don't want to take like a month two three four months
[19909.43s -> 19917.85s]  off when I would rather just stream more uh like periodically and that allows me to kind of do all
[19917.85s -> 19922.66s]  the stuff that I need to do and there's other it's not just the medical stuff too there's all
[19922.66s -> 19932.95s]  I have other stuff going on too that I really have to focus on and I'm gonna stream for fun
[19933.51s -> 19941.67s]  and when I think it's fun to do there's lots of opportunities to do games and play different things
[19941.67s -> 19946.97s]  and come up with some new ideas and there's there's a bunch of big stuff coming that's
[19946.97s -> 19955.37s]  happening soon but I need to be in a mindset to you know feel like it and want to
[19956.33s -> 20001.30s]  I'm gonna kill him I saved the money yeah I might need it this guy stinks funny or no I don't want
[20001.30s -> 20008.94s]  that how come this guy's not making any jokes I think the screen is really self-explanatory
[20008.94s -> 20020.90s]  how do I add to this besides making fart noises myself you know I'm stealing material from me
[20020.90s -> 20024.10s]  usually I would be the one making like the poo-poo noises and like the fart faces and stuff
[20031.99s -> 20043.46s]  chop speed up and the empress no I mean hermit all right this is it what do we get when I'm gonna
[20043.46s -> 20072.95s]  get what do I get for doing this kill him whatever I don't care if it hurt me I don't even care if
[20072.95s -> 20097.45s]  it hurts you say right or left ah I'm gonna skip it I don't care down maybe make him hit himself
[20097.45s -> 20110.31s]  on the thing there yeah fortnight we about to get down can kill his board right now
[20111.03s -> 20114.79s]  I just got down I revived and then we're going southbound
[20116.23s -> 20123.22s]  stepping the gas we're going part three out of the gas we're going I don't know wherever it goes
[20128.73s -> 20132.25s]  all right what does this do this was kind of just running around killing stuff with poop
[20133.13s -> 20176.28s]  and all right let's go kill hope I don't die he's stepping on them and killing them
[20191.86s -> 20210.25s]  money spawn somebody and
[20211.77s -> 20224.04s]  all right wait what's this part got it dirty mind has appeared in the basement
[20224.04s -> 20250.30s]  I unlock any other ones no not yet all right I think that's gonna be it I will see you guys um
[20251.18s -> 20259.90s]  probably on Saturday we're gonna go Saturday next time I'm gonna spend the week here going back and
[20259.90s -> 20267.19s]  forth with some stuff and medical stuff too let's see how this plays out I'm I'm really trying to
[20267.19s -> 20273.42s]  find out if this is gonna be worth doing or not I'm I'm hoping it is but at least you know I'm
[20273.42s -> 20280.38s]  I'm not gone I'm here it's just gonna be like a weekly show maybe two times a week I'm not just
[20280.38s -> 20285.82s]  gonna close the door on let's say that it's every Saturday that Sunday they won't be ever be a
[20285.82s -> 20291.06s]  stream so there'll probably be lots of occasions where it's like Saturday Sunday Saturday Sunday
[20291.06s -> 20294.66s]  Saturday Sunday Saturday Saturday Saturday Saturday Sunday Saturday Sunday
[20295.22s -> 20308.70s]  that's what I'm assuming is gonna happen we'll find out I will be back I'll see you guys again
[20308.70s -> 20312.38s]  thanks for watching I know we've kind of just played Isaac but really looking forward to it
[20313.02s -> 20319.43s]  we're gonna do The Sims 1 next weekend take care of yourselves I'll have a lot more to talk about
[20319.43s -> 20327.16s]  next weekend as well and I would assume that because of playing The Sims 1 you can probably
[20327.16s -> 20334.04s]  assume a Saturday Sunday scenario because you can't get a whole lot done in just like one day
[20334.04s -> 20341.35s]  in The Sims so we'll probably do our first one too next weekend because I want to give The Sims 1
[20341.35s -> 20347.99s]  time to play it and have fun so we'll see have a great rest of your night lots of shit is in the
[20347.99s -> 20353.64s]  works I hope you enjoy it when you see it in the coming few months again Grotto Beast is a real
[20353.64s -> 20362.50s]  thing there'll be more info on that next week take care of yourselves there were a lot of community
[20362.50s -> 20372.47s]  subs take a look this is gonna fly then yeah there's a lot of subs when you don't stream for
[20372.47s -> 20385.46s]  a month you get like a barcode scan going by oh my goodness and I want to make this really clear
[20385.46s -> 20392.62s]  too but I just for people to just because I really want to say it I understand like I get it if if
[20392.62s -> 20397.58s]  you've been a sub or if you are thinking of subbing and you don't think that like four or five
[20397.58s -> 20404.78s]  streams a month is worth subbing don't I don't want you to if you don't think that's worth it
[20404.78s -> 20412.20s]  so I I'm dialing back the streams to a point where I don't want people to still feel obligated
[20412.20s -> 20416.22s]  to think that they have to stay subscribed if they don't think that paying for like essentially
[20416.78s -> 20425.10s]  optionally paying for like four or five streams a month is worth it so I'm not going to hold that
[20425.10s -> 20430.12s]  against anybody if they don't want to stay subbed to the channel even people that have been here
[20430.12s -> 20447.34s]  for a long time I need to make that really clear he hates his subs what about badge Andy that's
[20447.34s -> 20464.74s]  right I have to give you money you don't sub even harder no I I want you to think it's worth
[20464.74s -> 20476.04s]  watching whatever you're watching and if we slow down a lot it's all right this is ridiculous
[20476.04s -> 20486.71s]  though how many subs is it today I need to know oh Jesus it was let's get a good picture here
[20491.03s -> 20499.05s]  I think I think like you know you know and you know what no I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna say it
[20499.85s -> 20504.26s]  because I don't want to talk about that I don't want to be like oh hey wow
[20504.26s -> 20509.90s]  X amount of subs today awesome I don't think I'm even gonna say it I don't think it's needs to be
[20509.90s -> 20520.84s]  said because I think that saying it is almost like me inceptioning into your mind like wow look at
[20520.84s -> 20526.94s]  how many subs were today oh I mean see you next week when I mean I better still have them I don't
[20526.94s -> 20540.15s]  think I want to do that anymore so thank you though it was a lot and with that I will see you on
[20540.15s -> 20546.57s]  Saturday and probably Sunday too for Sims one we're going back to the original the scary one
