[4.73s -> 14.52s]  Late. No, no, no. I'm not late. I'm contractually obligated to be here!
[14.52s -> 16.44s]  Holy shit. What? That sounded weird.
[23.42s -> 27.10s]  That was like... I don't know what that... I don't know.
[28.58s -> 33.22s]  My, like, throat just took that and blended it up into a bunch of liquid.
[36.06s -> 37.50s]  I don't know what that was. I'm sorry.
[38.30s -> 44.66s]  Anyways, hi. Got a lot of stuff going on this weekend.
[45.30s -> 49.59s]  I'm not even supposed to be here right now.
[51.16s -> 54.36s]  Usually the intro screen is there for two, three minutes.
[54.92s -> 57.08s]  I was just ready.
[57.08s -> 63.99s]  Yeah, we're going to be live for three days in a row.
[63.99s -> 66.07s]  We got today, tomorrow, and Saturday.
[68.57s -> 74.84s]  Lots of games to play, including, of course, Gotham Knights.
[75.48s -> 77.38s]  Sponsored to play Gotham Knights.
[79.75s -> 82.87s]  Then this is an Omega sponsor because it's three days in a row.
[83.85s -> 91.66s]  But, but Gotham Knights is only going to be for a couple hours a day.
[94.74s -> 98.18s]  And I'm going to be here for at least five to seven hours each day.
[98.90s -> 100.50s]  We got a lot of shit to play.
[105.40s -> 106.68s]  Omega gaming weekend.
[106.68s -> 108.60s]  We want Scorn. I beat Scorn.
[109.16s -> 111.80s]  I literally beat Scorn three days ago.
[118.22s -> 118.94s]  Do it again.
[120.78s -> 122.06s]  There's not even a second ending.
[122.78s -> 125.58s]  By the way, okay, let me tell you about Scorn.
[126.98s -> 131.88s]  I sat down and after an evening and after sleeping on it,
[133.14s -> 134.98s]  I kind of realized how much I liked that game.
[136.52s -> 137.64s]  I really liked it.
[138.28s -> 140.68s]  It was, I don't know, it stuck with me for a little while.
[142.60s -> 145.88s]  It was just like, whoa, that game was weird.
[146.52s -> 147.64s]  It stuck with me for a little while.
[147.64s -> 155.22s]  It did play the sound.
[155.22s -> 156.26s]  I actually still have it.
[160.09s -> 161.61s]  It's still saved here.
[161.61s -> 162.57s]  That's so stupid.
[167.86s -> 171.94s]  But yeah, so you probably saw the title playing Crash Bandicoot 4.
[171.94s -> 172.98s]  It's about time.
[175.74s -> 177.82s]  I have, well, the title already says it.
[178.38s -> 180.70s]  I've never played Crash Bandicoot.
[180.70s -> 184.86s]  I don't have, I probably have like maybe 40 minutes total across the whole franchise
[185.42s -> 187.02s]  across various demo discs.
[189.29s -> 193.21s]  So we're starting with, in the middle of the Star Wars franchise.
[193.85s -> 202.12s]  Have you played it?
[202.12s -> 203.56s]  Have you played Uncharted?
[204.28s -> 209.85s]  No, no, I've never played Uncharted.
[210.57s -> 213.61s]  I don't even know what, honestly, I don't even know what that game is.
[216.07s -> 220.70s]  I know that Uncharted is about a guy that runs around getting treasure.
[220.70s -> 223.34s]  And then sometimes when something bad happens, he goes,
[223.34s -> 224.54s]  oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[225.26s -> 226.94s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[227.50s -> 227.90s]  That's it.
[227.90s -> 229.34s]  I don't know anything about, I don't have nothing.
[229.34s -> 230.06s]  I don't know anything else.
[230.70s -> 236.82s]  Should I play Uncharted?
[236.82s -> 237.46s]  Should I just do it?
[238.18s -> 242.78s]  Is it fun?
[242.78s -> 243.42s]  Is it a good game?
[247.50s -> 249.18s]  Is the Uncharted series a good franchise?
[249.99s -> 250.71s]  And do a poll.
[250.71s -> 253.91s]  I want it to be at least, it's not 80% at least I won't play it.
[258.02s -> 261.70s]  Is Uncharted a great franchise?
[261.70s -> 266.71s]  I want to see a poll.
[269.90s -> 271.74s]  And if it's over 80%, I'll play it.
[280.44s -> 281.67s]  Okay.
[281.67s -> 283.43s]  And I didn't say good, I say great.
[284.86s -> 286.30s]  Great franchise.
[292.36s -> 292.92s]  Okay.
[292.92s -> 293.42s]  Whoa.
[295.35s -> 295.83s]  Oh, no.
[296.47s -> 297.59s]  This is not what I expected.
[297.59s -> 299.91s]  I thought everybody loved this franchise.
[301.22s -> 301.94s]  Really?
[301.94s -> 302.90s]  That seems pretty high.
[309.83s -> 311.19s]  40, 50%.
[314.62s -> 315.42s]  What?
[315.42s -> 319.77s]  The later games are much more enjoyable.
[325.06s -> 326.74s]  It's good, but it's not great.
[328.20s -> 331.32s]  Are we going under 50% here for is it a great franchise?
[339.64s -> 340.14s]  Okay.
[340.95s -> 343.27s]  Well, I guess maybe I'll pass on it.
[343.99s -> 345.59s]  Maybe one day I'll play it for fun.
[347.72s -> 348.76s]  All right, let's get started.
[348.76s -> 349.24s]  Let's go.
[349.24s -> 350.04s]  We're playing.
[350.04s -> 352.76s]  We got like six or seven games to play this weekend.
[353.32s -> 358.42s]  And of course, Gotham Knights.
[359.06s -> 360.97s]  But that's not right now.
[361.69s -> 362.33s]  We'll do that later.
[362.89s -> 365.56s]  The way that this is going to be sectioned off is
[367.08s -> 370.36s]  for like the first two, three hours, maybe first few hours,
[370.36s -> 371.16s]  we'll play some stuff.
[371.80s -> 375.16s]  And the stream will always end with Gotham Knights.
[375.16s -> 377.16s]  That'll be like the second half of each stream.
[377.96s -> 381.02s]  I'm ready to play Crash Band.
[381.02s -> 382.38s]  Am I going to like this game?
[382.38s -> 384.38s]  How do you even play Crash Bandicoot?
[384.38s -> 386.47s]  It's like an RTS or something.
[389.19s -> 390.71s]  Imagine if he thought that.
[402.31s -> 403.59s]  You jump and run.
[403.59s -> 403.91s]  Okay.
[403.91s -> 404.87s]  This is kind of loud.
[404.87s -> 409.50s]  It's loud for me.
[410.14s -> 411.70s]  It's a little better.
[411.70s -> 412.18s]  All right.
[412.18s -> 413.54s]  Crash Bandicoot 4.
[413.54s -> 414.50s]  It's about time.
[416.55s -> 417.43s]  Oh, cutscene.
[421.62s -> 423.30s]  You look like 20 today.
[423.30s -> 423.86s]  24.
[424.73s -> 425.69s]  Let's go shaved.
[425.69s -> 426.19s]  Quiet.
[427.38s -> 428.42s]  Crash Band.
[428.42s -> 430.49s]  At last.
[430.49s -> 433.29s]  I, the great Neo Cortex.
[433.29s -> 436.66s]  Have you right where I want you.
[436.66s -> 438.74s]  And now the final blow.
[438.74s -> 443.56s]  Is Jimmy Neutron this guy's origin story?
[444.20s -> 445.24s]  Hush, simpleton.
[445.24s -> 446.04s]  Is it what he turned into?
[451.18s -> 452.62s]  Face it, entropy.
[452.62s -> 454.78s]  It's going to fail again.
[455.98s -> 459.74s]  At least Uka Uka and I attempt to free us from this prison.
[460.30s -> 464.62s]  I won't sit idly by and listen to your inane ramblings for another decade.
[465.34s -> 478.09s]  Whoa.
[491.83s -> 493.11s]  That guy's design is crazy.
[493.11s -> 493.91s]  Little clocks.
[494.79s -> 504.09s]  I feel like I should.
[504.09s -> 505.29s]  I'm not allowed to play this game.
[523.91s -> 524.41s]  Crash.
[525.11s -> 529.22s]  Like I have to put my save file from the first three games.
[529.22s -> 530.50s]  Otherwise, I'm not a real fan.
[534.90s -> 535.14s]  All right.
[535.14s -> 535.70s]  How do I play?
[540.50s -> 541.22s]  Fluid.
[541.22s -> 541.86s]  It's fluid.
[542.58s -> 545.53s]  I got to warn you.
[545.53s -> 546.89s]  I'm in a fucked up mood today.
[547.61s -> 550.06s]  But damn, I'm in a fucked up mood.
[551.16s -> 552.84s]  I got to get this out before the sponsor portion.
[553.40s -> 555.62s]  I got to get this out before the sponsor portion.
[555.62s -> 556.82s]  You know what I'm saying?
[556.82s -> 558.20s]  Okay, cool.
[558.90s -> 561.86s]  Dude, can I play the first three games on this?
[564.89s -> 572.42s]  Dude, you get apples, right?
[573.06s -> 578.97s]  Is there a double jump?
[578.97s -> 579.45s]  There is.
[579.45s -> 579.85s]  All right.
[584.26s -> 585.94s]  Oh, Joe HUD.
[586.89s -> 587.21s]  Okay.
[587.77s -> 588.33s]  Is this okay?
[588.33s -> 589.13s]  Is this a remake?
[589.93s -> 593.10s]  Or is this a brand new experience?
[599.22s -> 600.26s]  New game, original game.
[600.26s -> 601.06s]  All right.
[601.06s -> 603.94s]  This is kind of fun.
[610.02s -> 612.90s]  I remember this style of level being in the demo disc.
[618.70s -> 619.50s]  We must go.
[619.50s -> 627.83s]  They actually have a good shadow in this one.
[629.75s -> 630.71s]  They have pretty clean looking.
[630.71s -> 631.11s]  You're right.
[631.83s -> 635.69s]  Okay.
[635.69s -> 637.77s]  She shields me from damage.
[638.41s -> 639.29s]  You can take one hit, right?
[639.29s -> 640.33s]  You die in one hit in this game.
[644.28s -> 645.08s]  Oh, my God.
[646.41s -> 646.89s]  Wait, can I?
[647.45s -> 649.54s]  This is parry.
[655.66s -> 657.02s]  I'm biting my whole mouth off.
[657.66s -> 660.76s]  I don't know why I do this.
[661.32s -> 663.29s]  So just run.
[665.78s -> 666.26s]  What happened?
[666.26s -> 667.14s]  Oh, that was TNT.
[667.94s -> 668.92s]  All right.
[668.92s -> 669.88s]  That's Crash Bandicoot 4.
[669.88s -> 670.36s]  That was fun.
[671.40s -> 672.04s]  It's pretty good.
[672.92s -> 675.80s]  I'd say you should give it a try if you like it.
[676.52s -> 683.64s]  Are they bosses?
[684.28s -> 693.03s]  Will it blow up?
[700.50s -> 700.82s]  All right.
[700.82s -> 701.22s]  I get it.
[701.78s -> 707.99s]  Didn't they make like five racing games?
[708.63s -> 714.31s]  Yeah, I'm not playing on the retro mode.
[714.31s -> 715.51s]  I'm playing on the modern mode.
[715.51s -> 715.99s]  Is that bad?
[716.79s -> 721.11s]  Oh, shit.
[721.83s -> 741.18s]  This fluid checkpoint.
[741.18s -> 741.82s]  Cool.
[741.82s -> 743.51s]  Did you have two shields?
[746.97s -> 750.33s]  No, why would I play this scorned sound effect right now?
[750.89s -> 759.40s]  Oh, I can crawl.
[759.40s -> 759.64s]  Okay.
[764.12s -> 765.48s]  Ooh, all right.
[765.48s -> 767.90s]  I feel like this is a fun game to speed run.
[768.62s -> 772.97s]  Are you okay?
[772.97s -> 773.21s]  Yeah.
[773.93s -> 775.72s]  Why are you asking that?
[775.72s -> 777.99s]  Bonus round?
[783.75s -> 783.99s]  Nice.
[786.97s -> 788.89s]  Oh, wait.
[788.89s -> 789.53s]  Let's go get it.
[789.53s -> 789.77s]  Okay.
[790.41s -> 798.12s]  So how does this compare to the other ones?
[798.12s -> 799.16s]  Do you guys think it looks good?
[799.96s -> 807.72s]  How come you're not laughing hysterically at all the cartoon sound effects?
[814.09s -> 814.57s]  Why would I?
[823.53s -> 824.09s]  Bullshit.
[826.52s -> 827.24s]  Holy shit.
[839.74s -> 841.34s]  That's the only time I'm doing that for the whole night.
[841.34s -> 841.74s]  I promise.
[852.82s -> 853.14s]  Okay.
[853.14s -> 857.62s]  I will tell you I can not do that during Gotham nights.
[857.62s -> 858.26s]  Like, I can't.
[859.30s -> 860.58s]  I literally can't.
[861.96s -> 863.72s]  Like, I cannot look up at Gotham City,
[863.72s -> 866.36s]  at like the big sprawling city and all of a sudden you hear scorn.
[866.36s -> 868.68s]  That can't happen.
[868.68s -> 870.92s]  I genuinely think that I can't do that.
[877.10s -> 877.82s]  You have to.
[877.82s -> 878.78s]  I can't do that.
[879.50s -> 882.25s]  I'm missing four boxes?
[887.26s -> 889.02s]  You better remove that from your soundboard then.
[889.58s -> 890.78s]  Gems and skins?
[891.50s -> 893.86s]  Gems unlock skins.
[893.86s -> 895.22s]  Earn gems by breaking crates,
[895.22s -> 896.98s]  getting wumpa,
[896.98s -> 897.86s]  finding hidden gems,
[897.86s -> 899.46s]  and beating levels in three lives or less.
[900.26s -> 900.87s]  Okay.
[904.23s -> 904.95s]  All right.
[904.95s -> 908.20s]  That's kind of cool, I guess.
[908.20s -> 918.39s]  Is it just in-game currency?
[919.03s -> 920.15s]  I don't think you have to pay for anything.
[925.82s -> 928.54s]  Golden wumpa crates give 25 wumpa.
[928.54s -> 939.96s]  You didn't even tell me how to grab the fucking pole thing.
[940.84s -> 941.72s]  You didn't even tell me how to do it.
[941.72s -> 942.28s]  How do I do it?
[942.28s -> 942.84s]  How do I hold it?
[943.64s -> 951.90s]  I gave the whole jump.
[951.90s -> 952.46s]  Okay.
[952.46s -> 953.10s]  They didn't say that.
[954.18s -> 955.22s]  Where's my tutorial?
[955.86s -> 959.48s]  I don't know why I just tried to dodge.
[959.48s -> 960.52s]  There is a dodge roll.
[960.52s -> 961.08s]  Okay, there is.
[976.07s -> 977.35s]  You're too big of a streamer now?
[977.35s -> 978.15s]  Wait, what did the person say?
[978.71s -> 979.27s]  What did you say?
[981.94s -> 982.90s]  I know you're a big streamer.
[982.90s -> 984.02s]  Just don't forget your roots.
[984.74s -> 986.30s]  What do you mean?
[986.86s -> 992.66s]  You're gonna ban that guy?
[992.66s -> 993.38s]  No.
[993.38s -> 993.88s]  Why?
[994.58s -> 1001.94s]  You need longer hair.
[1002.58s -> 1006.79s]  I'm gonna hit this, aren't I?
[1009.29s -> 1011.59s]  Oh, okay.
[1011.59s -> 1012.15s]  You've changed.
[1012.79s -> 1013.27s]  I don't know.
[1013.27s -> 1014.15s]  I don't...
[1014.15s -> 1014.39s]  Okay.
[1014.39s -> 1015.51s]  I know everybody says this.
[1017.02s -> 1018.22s]  I don't think I have.
[1018.22s -> 1020.22s]  I feel like I have the same brain,
[1020.22s -> 1021.10s]  same thought process,
[1021.10s -> 1022.30s]  the same way I approach everything
[1022.30s -> 1026.15s]  since I was 25, 26.
[1026.87s -> 1029.11s]  I feel like I haven't really done anything that different.
[1029.83s -> 1031.78s]  Maybe I have.
[1032.42s -> 1034.09s]  I don't know.
[1034.09s -> 1034.57s]  It's hard to tell.
[1043.27s -> 1043.59s]  Whoa.
[1044.23s -> 1044.39s]  All right.
[1044.39s -> 1047.30s]  We're good.
[1047.30s -> 1049.22s]  Where's 2018 gerba?
[1049.78s -> 1056.38s]  Did you just kill me?
[1058.14s -> 1058.94s]  All right.
[1058.94s -> 1060.10s]  What's that?
[1060.66s -> 1061.46s]  Can I jump over there?
[1066.06s -> 1068.06s]  I thought that was like a magical item.
[1069.94s -> 1071.46s]  That looks like a secret to me.
[1074.25s -> 1076.89s]  Grabbing that little rat thing.
[1077.53s -> 1083.85s]  There's no iframes.
[1083.85s -> 1084.33s]  Okay.
[1084.33s -> 1085.45s]  I can't be losing in this game.
[1085.45s -> 1085.77s]  I just...
[1085.77s -> 1086.49s]  I physically can't.
[1090.49s -> 1092.49s]  If I die to this guy one more time,
[1092.49s -> 1094.49s]  I will do a scorn in Gotham Knights.
[1095.29s -> 1101.80s]  Thank God.
[1101.80s -> 1102.60s]  I physically...
[1102.60s -> 1103.64s]  I think that's literally not...
[1103.64s -> 1105.08s]  I think that's like the contract.
[1105.80s -> 1122.50s]  Okay.
[1122.50s -> 1123.30s]  All right.
[1123.30s -> 1125.78s]  The game got a lot harder in one tutorial level.
[1125.78s -> 1126.18s]  Hold on.
[1126.82s -> 1132.33s]  Bonus.
[1132.33s -> 1141.61s]  Cool.
[1141.61s -> 1146.82s]  While holding B, double jump.
[1148.49s -> 1151.05s]  Oh, it's like a Super Mario 2 Luigi jump.
[1151.05s -> 1151.69s]  That's kind of cool.
[1156.97s -> 1157.69s]  Oh, shit.
[1158.65s -> 1160.50s]  We're good.
[1161.14s -> 1166.52s]  We got it all.
[1166.52s -> 1171.83s]  12.
[1171.83s -> 1173.19s]  Oh, that's 12 right here, right?
[1174.84s -> 1175.16s]  Nice.
[1175.16s -> 1175.32s]  All right.
[1175.32s -> 1175.80s]  I got them all.
[1176.36s -> 1177.22s]  100%.
[1180.34s -> 1181.22s]  What game are you playing?
[1181.22s -> 1182.66s]  This is Crash Bandicoot 4.
[1183.30s -> 1196.82s]  Does this still count if I'm off screen?
[1203.67s -> 1203.91s]  All right.
[1203.91s -> 1204.31s]  I get it.
[1204.31s -> 1204.71s]  It wants you to...
[1212.92s -> 1213.72s]  Oh, my God.
[1213.72s -> 1214.68s]  I fucked it up.
[1244.26s -> 1244.50s]  Yes.
[1245.22s -> 1249.35s]  You listen to a Goo Goo Gaga game.
[1259.69s -> 1261.37s]  Super Mario 1 is one of the hardest games ever.
[1262.25s -> 1262.81s]  Sorry.
[1263.69s -> 1266.81s]  Crash Bandicoot PS1 is one of the hardest games of that generation.
[1267.85s -> 1275.80s]  Is this your fursona?
[1278.22s -> 1280.22s]  I mean, no, but it's kind of cool.
[1284.26s -> 1286.25s]  I don't know.
[1286.25s -> 1287.45s]  Is it a bandicoot?
[1288.25s -> 1292.09s]  What even is a bandicoot?
[1292.09s -> 1298.46s]  Cool.
[1298.46s -> 1314.07s]  I don't know.
[1314.07s -> 1315.27s]  I made a movie with this guy.
[1315.99s -> 1327.00s]  Can you see a 3D animated series?
[1328.49s -> 1329.21s]  TV series.
[1340.23s -> 1341.27s]  Oh, come on.
[1341.27s -> 1341.51s]  Two.
[1345.05s -> 1345.61s]  Two.
[1345.61s -> 1346.33s]  I missed two.
[1346.97s -> 1353.69s]  Can you please do the crash?
[1353.69s -> 1356.34s]  Whoa sound.
[1356.34s -> 1357.30s]  How does it go?
[1357.30s -> 1363.38s]  What does it sound like?
[1364.26s -> 1377.11s]  It goes, whoa.
[1377.11s -> 1377.51s]  Like that?
[1391.80s -> 1392.60s]  That's not even right.
[1400.23s -> 1400.71s]  I'll try it.
[1401.67s -> 1402.15s]  Whoa.
[1408.95s -> 1410.63s]  That kind of sounded like Luigi.
[1431.21s -> 1434.41s]  Time and space will be within our grasp.
[1434.41s -> 1435.69s]  Engine, embryo.
[1436.25s -> 1439.61s]  You had some little projects you wanted to tell me about?
[1439.61s -> 1445.13s]  Master, my mechanical marble will hypnotize you and I.
[1446.01s -> 1450.57s]  And my potion will make me and them unstoppable.
[1450.57s -> 1451.69s]  Right, yeah, fine, sure.
[1451.69s -> 1454.57s]  Have fun with your ray guns or whatever.
[1457.37s -> 1458.89s]  Pacing your steps.
[1458.89s -> 1465.93s]  By my calculations, our enemies are already moving against us and we will prevail.
[1470.14s -> 1470.46s]  Cool.
[1474.47s -> 1475.91s]  I don't know what the sound effect is.
[1481.40s -> 1482.52s]  Welcome to the dimensional map.
[1482.52s -> 1483.72s]  Here you can select levels to play.
[1483.72s -> 1485.56s]  Switch between Crash and Coco.
[1485.56s -> 1488.52s]  Change skins and replay levels to take on time trials.
[1488.52s -> 1489.16s]  Time trials.
[1489.88s -> 1500.60s]  Okay, all right.
[1501.24s -> 1505.05s]  This is the actual sound effect.
[1505.05s -> 1505.69s]  All right, hold on.
[1510.98s -> 1512.44s]  Whoa, whoa.
[1512.44s -> 1515.14s]  That was not even that different than what I did.
[1519.19s -> 1523.85s]  That was not even that different than the thing I just did.
[1523.85s -> 1528.23s]  Try it again.
[1529.35s -> 1533.50s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1533.50s -> 1534.30s]  I win.
[1534.30s -> 1542.28s]  All right, B level to unlock time trial.
[1542.28s -> 1544.07s]  Should I try this?
[1544.07s -> 1547.08s]  Hold on.
[1547.08s -> 1549.70s]  Wait, did I unlock a skin?
[1550.34s -> 1554.57s]  How do I get this?
[1554.57s -> 1556.33s]  Unlock in Rude Awakening.
[1556.97s -> 1557.83s]  Oh, shit.
[1561.10s -> 1562.62s]  There's so many skins.
[1566.26s -> 1567.54s]  Digital download.
[1567.54s -> 1568.50s]  Oh, look at that.
[1571.58s -> 1572.86s]  Totally tubular.
[1573.66s -> 1581.40s]  Should I use this one?
[1585.93s -> 1588.25s]  Unlock in Insanity Peak.
[1588.89s -> 1590.95s]  I mean, it's Halloween.
[1590.95s -> 1591.91s]  I'm going to do...
[1593.19s -> 1594.95s]  Do they have the same moves?
[1595.59s -> 1596.63s]  Are both characters the same moves?
[1597.27s -> 1600.10s]  Let's try.
[1600.66s -> 1612.62s]  They're exactly the same?
[1612.62s -> 1612.94s]  Okay.
[1634.90s -> 1635.38s]  It's cool.
[1656.81s -> 1657.05s]  Go!
[1657.85s -> 1665.98s]  Wait, A's world?
[1665.98s -> 1670.26s]  Oh, this is kind of weird.
[1670.26s -> 1670.58s]  All right.
[1684.42s -> 1686.18s]  The depth is hard to do here.
[1686.18s -> 1686.82s]  Hold on.
[1686.82s -> 1692.31s]  I want to try to get as many boxes as I can.
[1704.60s -> 1706.49s]  Shut up.
[1706.49s -> 1708.33s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[1708.33s -> 1709.13s]  I'm never going to beat this.
[1746.30s -> 1748.54s]  Oh, my God.
[1748.54s -> 1749.42s]  Don't freak out.
[1749.42s -> 1749.90s]  Like, stop.
[1750.46s -> 1751.02s]  I don't like...
[1753.10s -> 1753.82s]  What's happening?
[1753.82s -> 1754.14s]  I don't...
[1754.14s -> 1755.74s]  I genuinely don't understand.
[1756.46s -> 1759.03s]  Is that jump way larger than I think it is?
[1759.83s -> 1761.58s]  I'm going to lose to the second level.
[1767.88s -> 1769.96s]  Why is this jump five times bigger than I think it is?
[1770.68s -> 1773.14s]  That jump is huge.
[1773.14s -> 1774.18s]  Okay, that was the problem.
[1774.18s -> 1774.58s]  I'm good.
[1775.30s -> 1784.73s]  I like that sound.
[1785.37s -> 1793.77s]  Sorcery, sorcery, sorcery.
[1794.33s -> 1797.59s]  What about it?
[1797.59s -> 1798.47s]  I should play it?
[1798.47s -> 1799.03s]  Yeah, I will.
[1808.78s -> 1809.42s]  One, two...
[1812.17s -> 1813.69s]  Oh, I missed dialogue.
[1813.69s -> 1814.01s]  Shit.
[1814.81s -> 1823.58s]  Don't kill me, please.
[1824.73s -> 1826.81s]  Nitro crates explode on touch.
[1827.53s -> 1830.02s]  Is that a bad thing?
[1830.74s -> 1831.86s]  That's a bad thing, right?
[1832.82s -> 1833.94s]  How do I do this?
[1833.94s -> 1834.66s]  Is this a bad thing?
[1840.82s -> 1841.78s]  But do I...
[1841.78s -> 1842.50s]  Okay, I have a question.
[1843.06s -> 1845.06s]  Do I have to break those?
[1845.06s -> 1847.86s]  Does it count to my total crate count at the end?
[1853.53s -> 1854.25s]  No.
[1854.25s -> 1856.26s]  It's not that complicated.
[1858.01s -> 1861.64s]  I'm just asking a very simple question.
[1862.20s -> 1863.00s]  Okay, no health.
[1863.80s -> 1866.44s]  This game came out in like 1994.
[1866.44s -> 1867.40s]  What do you mean no health?
[1868.44s -> 1870.92s]  Well, this one came out like yesterday or today, whatever it was.
[1877.46s -> 1878.26s]  Those...
[1878.26s -> 1880.50s]  All right, so don't touch these.
[1886.73s -> 1889.43s]  Oh, relax.
[1889.43s -> 1892.50s]  I have to break them all.
[1893.06s -> 1899.24s]  I'm just going to go with the fact and assume that I don't.
[1903.05s -> 1903.55s]  No.
[1904.09s -> 1911.37s]  Okay, so there is a butt drop.
[1912.01s -> 1912.65s]  I did it before.
[1921.32s -> 1921.72s]  Hang.
[1922.12s -> 1926.60s]  Oh, missed a box.
[1928.04s -> 1942.82s]  I got a golden pear.
[1943.46s -> 1949.05s]  You missed two.
[1949.05s -> 1949.53s]  Whatever.
[1950.17s -> 1955.00s]  This is not 100% playthrough.
[1955.64s -> 1958.02s]  This is a kind of sort of playthrough.
[1967.45s -> 1968.01s]  Go back.
[1969.14s -> 1970.26s]  I can't even go backwards.
[1971.67s -> 1971.91s]  Why?
[1971.91s -> 1973.43s]  I've banned that person.
[1973.43s -> 1975.03s]  Time that person off for 10 minutes.
[1975.03s -> 1988.07s]  My god.
[1988.07s -> 1989.35s]  I'm so mad at that person.
[1996.60s -> 1997.88s]  No, and it ruined everything.
[1998.44s -> 2000.76s]  How many lives do I have?
[2001.56s -> 2008.26s]  Gotham Knights contract.
[2008.90s -> 2009.94s]  No scorn.
[2010.18s -> 2010.82s]  Sign here.
[2011.38s -> 2013.54s]  It's the baseball signature.
[2017.83s -> 2018.47s]  That's pretty good.
[2022.54s -> 2023.58s]  I don't care if I get...
[2023.58s -> 2023.98s]  Whatever.
[2045.67s -> 2046.15s]  Jesus.
[2046.71s -> 2055.11s]  Okay, move on, please.
[2058.10s -> 2058.82s]  Uh-oh.
[2058.82s -> 2060.33s]  I have a time limit.
[2067.58s -> 2069.58s]  That's like walking on a Dark Souls banister.
[2084.06s -> 2084.70s]  I like this level.
[2086.01s -> 2094.52s]  Oh, I thought that was a fucking button.
[2094.52s -> 2095.24s]  I'm so...
[2095.24s -> 2096.04s]  Don't start me back.
[2124.86s -> 2125.98s]  I like this game.
[2125.98s -> 2126.38s]  I like it.
[2126.38s -> 2126.86s]  It's tricky.
[2127.34s -> 2140.09s]  I like it.
[2140.09s -> 2141.05s]  It's tricky.
[2141.05s -> 2154.41s]  I like it.
[2154.41s -> 2154.97s]  It's...
[2154.97s -> 2156.17s]  I like it.
[2156.17s -> 2156.73s]  It's tricky.
[2157.37s -> 2164.50s]  I gotta get all 22.
[2165.06s -> 2170.09s]  Does that do?
[2172.17s -> 2172.89s]  Oh, it's...
[2172.89s -> 2173.21s]  All right.
[2173.21s -> 2174.09s]  Let me calculate this.
[2179.59s -> 2179.91s]  All right.
[2179.91s -> 2180.47s]  Calculated.
[2181.11s -> 2197.27s]  Shit.
[2197.27s -> 2200.04s]  I thought that was...
[2200.04s -> 2200.44s]  All right.
[2200.44s -> 2205.50s]  So now I think it's gotta be this.
[2207.21s -> 2207.45s]  Yup.
[2208.09s -> 2213.64s]  Okay.
[2214.20s -> 2215.18s]  Thank you.
[2215.74s -> 2219.27s]  That's them all.
[2219.27s -> 2220.47s]  I got 22.
[2220.47s -> 2229.58s]  Pretty sick.
[2236.15s -> 2236.87s]  Oh, secret.
[2252.76s -> 2253.24s]  Get out of here.
[2265.35s -> 2267.82s]  Did I miss any behind me?
[2268.46s -> 2270.79s]  No, we're good.
[2276.60s -> 2277.08s]  Oh, my God.
[2277.08s -> 2277.56s]  It's gonna fall.
[2282.04s -> 2282.68s]  Why did I do that?
[2298.10s -> 2298.82s]  Dude, too loud.
[2298.82s -> 2299.38s]  Too one-up.
[2314.07s -> 2316.42s]  Okay.
[2316.42s -> 2317.14s]  So what did I...
[2317.14s -> 2317.62s]  Oh, okay.
[2317.62s -> 2317.86s]  I know.
[2317.86s -> 2319.06s]  I know what I did wrong last time.
[2339.58s -> 2339.98s]  Okay.
[2343.16s -> 2343.40s]  Wait.
[2343.88s -> 2344.36s]  Wait a minute.
[2346.82s -> 2347.22s]  Excuse me.
[2347.22s -> 2347.94s]  What's under there?
[2348.66s -> 2350.26s]  Nothing.
[2350.26s -> 2352.04s]  Okay.
[2352.04s -> 2355.43s]  I can't...
[2355.43s -> 2374.01s]  How?
[2374.01s -> 2374.33s]  I can't...
[2375.05s -> 2379.40s]  It just told me to crawl.
[2386.09s -> 2388.09s]  Dude, there's a fucking invisible wall right there.
[2388.09s -> 2388.81s]  Did I skip Luigi?
[2389.53s -> 2391.21s]  There's an invisible wall.
[2391.21s -> 2392.01s]  I thought I had to jump up there.
[2392.01s -> 2392.33s]  All right.
[2392.33s -> 2394.25s]  Why hold B to crawl?
[2394.89s -> 2396.46s]  I don't get this.
[2398.71s -> 2400.23s]  I actually just did that.
[2401.11s -> 2401.67s]  Whatever.
[2401.67s -> 2402.15s]  I don't care.
[2405.83s -> 2406.63s]  I just...
[2406.63s -> 2410.98s]  I did the NG teleporter kill to myself.
[2411.62s -> 2419.03s]  All right.
[2419.03s -> 2419.67s]  How are we doing here?
[2422.79s -> 2423.43s]  Oh, my God.
[2423.43s -> 2423.83s]  I didn't...
[2423.83s -> 2424.63s]  I pressed the wrong button.
[2425.43s -> 2434.04s]  I shouldn't crush them.
[2442.15s -> 2442.39s]  Wait.
[2450.09s -> 2461.40s]  I like the level design.
[2461.40s -> 2462.12s]  It's actually really good.
[2464.28s -> 2465.96s]  The level design is actually good.
[2466.84s -> 2471.62s]  Sometimes they make a game like this and it like sucks.
[2471.62s -> 2472.02s]  You know what I mean?
[2472.58s -> 2477.43s]  Come on.
[2477.43s -> 2477.91s]  Get up there.
[2494.41s -> 2494.81s]  Damn it.
[2495.37s -> 2497.96s]  Okay.
[2497.96s -> 2498.20s]  Cool.
[2498.76s -> 2501.30s]  Let's don't fall off.
[2501.30s -> 2506.74s]  Destroys all nitro crates in this level.
[2508.86s -> 2509.82s]  146.
[2509.82s -> 2510.38s]  It's all right.
[2510.38s -> 2510.86s]  I'll take it.
[2511.66s -> 2516.33s]  I'll take it.
[2520.58s -> 2524.63s]  My FPS dropping on my camera.
[2524.63s -> 2525.03s]  A little bit.
[2531.22s -> 2532.58s]  Restart the level.
[2532.58s -> 2543.24s]  Wait.
[2543.24s -> 2544.04s]  I can restart.
[2544.04s -> 2544.28s]  Wait.
[2544.92s -> 2545.74s]  Play level.
[2548.49s -> 2549.29s]  Time to beat.
[2549.29s -> 2552.01s]  Is that one hour and 39 minutes?
[2552.01s -> 2552.33s]  Wait.
[2552.33s -> 2553.69s]  Do I actually fight against a ghost?
[2554.33s -> 2561.91s]  Do you actually see the ghost on screen?
[2562.55s -> 2575.58s]  I did not beat this level in a minute and 39 seconds.
[2575.58s -> 2581.77s]  This took me like 20 minutes.
[2582.41s -> 2585.42s]  Do I get to...
[2585.42s -> 2586.22s]  Is it like a...
[2586.22s -> 2586.38s]  Okay.
[2586.38s -> 2586.86s]  Here we go.
[2587.66s -> 2589.30s]  Oh, let's go.
[2593.08s -> 2593.88s]  He's a fucking idiot.
[2593.88s -> 2595.32s]  He's going to fall like three times at this part.
[2597.06s -> 2597.70s]  Hey, wait.
[2599.32s -> 2599.96s]  What the fuck?
[2608.34s -> 2609.06s]  That's not me.
[2609.06s -> 2609.78s]  I didn't do that.
[2612.22s -> 2613.02s]  That's not even me.
[2614.28s -> 2615.56s]  It's a speed run.
[2615.56s -> 2619.00s]  Oh, I thought that was me.
[2619.00s -> 2621.88s]  I thought it was like a ghost thing like in Mario Kart.
[2621.88s -> 2634.58s]  All right.
[2634.58s -> 2635.38s]  Let's go.
[2635.38s -> 2638.90s]  It's a speed run.
[2638.90s -> 2640.82s]  I thought I was racing against the ghost.
[2641.22s -> 2642.42s]  In Mario Kart.
[2642.42s -> 2644.92s]  Stop referencing Mario.
[2644.92s -> 2651.21s]  It's the most celebrated video game franchise in human history.
[2651.77s -> 2654.65s]  Guys, the cavemen even knew who the fuck Mario was.
[2654.65s -> 2655.05s]  It's...
[2655.05s -> 2657.05s]  You cannot not make Mario references.
[2657.77s -> 2676.46s]  Okay, cool.
[2676.46s -> 2678.04s]  What else you got?
[2681.22s -> 2682.42s]  I'll be very honest.
[2682.42s -> 2686.18s]  I really thought this was going to be kind of shit.
[2686.18s -> 2687.54s]  I'm going to be just very upfront.
[2687.54s -> 2688.82s]  I just didn't think I was going to care.
[2689.54s -> 2692.74s]  I thought it was going to be like each one of these levels is kind of just...
[2693.46s -> 2697.86s]  Oh, it's like world 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5.
[2697.86s -> 2699.38s]  And they're all like the exact same.
[2699.38s -> 2701.32s]  It's like no difference.
[2701.32s -> 2703.56s]  It's just kind of a slightly different level with different platforms.
[2703.56s -> 2706.04s]  But each one of these levels seems pretty different.
[2706.04s -> 2707.16s]  I like the design so far.
[2708.04s -> 2709.08s]  Game critic Andy.
[2709.80s -> 2711.22s]  I like the design.
[2711.22s -> 2712.42s]  I like what they've done with this so far.
[2713.38s -> 2715.35s]  Like, what the fuck?
[2715.35s -> 2716.15s]  Who cares what I think?
[2716.15s -> 2717.03s]  I eat boogers.
[2717.03s -> 2717.83s]  Like, you know what I mean?
[2717.83s -> 2719.11s]  Like, who cares what I say?
[2719.83s -> 2722.50s]  What is in here?
[2743.93s -> 2744.49s]  Wait.
[2744.49s -> 2745.61s]  Don't forget about the secrets.
[2747.90s -> 2748.94s]  Yeah, I got to get this out of me.
[2749.50s -> 2750.54s]  I have to get it out of my system.
[2750.54s -> 2752.70s]  I can't say I eat boogers on the sponsored part of the screen.
[2753.58s -> 2761.37s]  I got hit?
[2761.37s -> 2772.01s]  Who made this game?
[2772.97s -> 2773.85s]  What's the company?
[2773.85s -> 2774.57s]  Don't touch that.
[2774.57s -> 2774.97s]  Get back.
[2775.61s -> 2776.86s]  No, go back.
[2776.86s -> 2777.34s]  I want to go back.
[2777.34s -> 2777.74s]  I want to go back.
[2777.74s -> 2778.06s]  Just die.
[2778.06s -> 2778.70s]  How do I fall off?
[2779.42s -> 2780.55s]  How do you fall?
[2781.35s -> 2781.67s]  Okay.
[2782.39s -> 2788.94s]  That's nothing.
[2788.94s -> 2789.82s]  I think I just lost the level.
[2792.81s -> 2793.53s]  What is that then?
[2794.17s -> 2805.99s]  Whatever.
[2805.99s -> 2806.79s]  Oh, shit.
[2806.79s -> 2806.95s]  No.
[2807.67s -> 2808.07s]  Whatever.
[2812.49s -> 2812.89s]  What's that?
[2816.44s -> 2817.32s]  What's that?
[2817.32s -> 2827.74s]  How do I even get that?
[2827.74s -> 2836.57s]  How do I get that?
[2836.57s -> 2852.46s]  I keep missing it.
[2853.42s -> 2854.30s]  I don't know how to get that.
[2855.02s -> 2857.91s]  Oh, yes, I do.
[2858.95s -> 2859.35s]  Stupid.
[2860.07s -> 2864.89s]  How do I get up?
[2864.89s -> 2867.85s]  Oopsie.
[2867.85s -> 2868.01s]  Okay.
[2868.01s -> 2868.89s]  Well, what did that do?
[2880.15s -> 2880.79s]  That's what it was.
[2881.43s -> 2887.19s]  Is that what it was?
[2887.75s -> 2894.06s]  It's your favorite 2D platformer of all time.
[2894.70s -> 2899.62s]  I really kind of don't like them that much.
[2900.42s -> 2903.38s]  I enjoy them, but not really enough to care that much to have a favorite.
[2912.97s -> 2915.93s]  I enjoy them, but it's not like, oh, wow, my favorite.
[2920.12s -> 2921.72s]  Name some iconic platformers.
[2921.72s -> 2922.52s]  I'll tell you if I play them.
[2924.01s -> 2924.49s]  Mario.
[2924.49s -> 2924.73s]  Yeah.
[2924.73s -> 2926.73s]  But I mean, what's the easy question?
[2930.44s -> 2931.40s]  Celeste was really good.
[2931.40s -> 2931.80s]  Yep.
[2931.80s -> 2932.92s]  Celeste was very good.
[2933.64s -> 2934.54s]  It's probably up there.
[2941.35s -> 2942.07s]  Doodle jump.
[2942.63s -> 2943.67s]  I never played it.
[2943.67s -> 2947.27s]  This is not timed, right?
[2947.27s -> 2948.07s]  Yoshi's Island?
[2948.07s -> 2949.59s]  Yoshi's Island was pretty good.
[2950.31s -> 2953.22s]  How do I tackle this?
[2959.50s -> 2960.30s]  How do I tackle this?
[2962.09s -> 2962.97s]  How do I tackle this?
[2962.97s -> 2964.09s]  I don't know.
[2964.09s -> 2969.46s]  I definitely can turn this back on, right?
[2969.46s -> 2970.86s]  Let's see.
[2971.74s -> 2972.70s]  Because I don't want to get rid of them.
[2984.95s -> 2985.35s]  There it is.
[2991.78s -> 2995.26s]  Oh, okay.
[2995.26s -> 3002.89s]  Very cool.
[3002.89s -> 3003.21s]  All right.
[3003.21s -> 3003.69s]  There we go.
[3003.69s -> 3004.33s]  All right.
[3004.33s -> 3008.30s]  Number two, 20.
[3008.30s -> 3010.49s]  Where's the 24?
[3014.89s -> 3015.69s]  Oh, my God.
[3015.69s -> 3016.33s]  I didn't leave one.
[3017.05s -> 3020.79s]  Oh, that sucks.
[3020.79s -> 3021.43s]  What did I miss?
[3027.40s -> 3028.76s]  I have to leave at least one there.
[3029.48s -> 3037.70s]  There's one above here.
[3038.26s -> 3047.86s]  What happened?
[3047.86s -> 3048.82s]  Oh, my goodness.
[3048.82s -> 3049.62s]  I thought I jumped.
[3050.94s -> 3052.06s]  Something wrong with this dude.
[3052.86s -> 3063.58s]  I love how hard it is.
[3064.30s -> 3066.73s]  It doesn't hold your hand.
[3067.37s -> 3078.17s]  My favorite part is that it doesn't hold your hand.
[3078.81s -> 3079.86s]  Oh, there it is.
[3088.20s -> 3088.84s]  Left one.
[3088.84s -> 3089.80s]  There we go.
[3089.80s -> 3090.30s]  Okay.
[3113.27s -> 3113.99s]  Don't miss.
[3114.47s -> 3118.73s]  This thing can crush me, right?
[3121.37s -> 3122.17s]  It almost happened.
[3122.97s -> 3127.77s]  I almost have a three.
[3127.77s -> 3136.26s]  No, don't die.
[3138.66s -> 3139.54s]  There's no checkpoint.
[3140.18s -> 3159.18s]  Why is that here?
[3161.38s -> 3162.02s]  There it is.
[3163.38s -> 3171.86s]  Okay.
[3172.50s -> 3175.34s]  Do I have 100% so far?
[3175.98s -> 3177.80s]  I think I do.
[3178.44s -> 3182.34s]  I think I have 100%.
[3190.70s -> 3191.42s]  No, go back.
[3200.25s -> 3202.17s]  What the fuck just happened?
[3202.17s -> 3204.23s]  I thought that stuck out further.
[3220.58s -> 3234.15s]  Okay, you have to do super jump.
[3235.11s -> 3235.83s]  Seriously.
[3236.63s -> 3237.43s]  The super jump.
[3237.43s -> 3240.07s]  I was still pressing it so I ground pounded down.
[3240.71s -> 3255.38s]  Okay.
[3255.38s -> 3257.78s]  There we go.
[3258.42s -> 3259.06s]  All right, we're good.
[3274.25s -> 3275.21s]  Did I get everything?
[3275.21s -> 3278.76s]  I can't tell.
[3278.76s -> 3280.04s]  I actually really don't know.
[3280.04s -> 3280.54s]  That way?
[3283.22s -> 3284.02s]  Nothing touched me.
[3287.45s -> 3288.25s]  Nothing touched me.
[3303.90s -> 3305.42s]  No, this is hurting my brain a little.
[3305.42s -> 3305.92s]  Okay.
[3311.03s -> 3312.55s]  Oh, shit.
[3312.55s -> 3313.19s]  Okay, I'm good.
[3315.11s -> 3315.61s]  No.
[3318.33s -> 3318.97s]  What happened?
[3319.85s -> 3321.21s]  What does it hurt my butt?
[3342.74s -> 3343.46s]  Dude.
[3343.46s -> 3344.84s]  What?
[3344.84s -> 3348.23s]  Okay, we're good.
[3348.23s -> 3348.95s]  Nice.
[3348.95s -> 3351.08s]  Is that it that's over here?
[3351.08s -> 3352.04s]  I can jump on top of that.
[3353.80s -> 3354.12s]  All right.
[3354.12s -> 3355.00s]  Now what?
[3355.00s -> 3356.98s]  I'm just gonna go for it.
[3360.25s -> 3362.17s]  That was the dumbest fucking thing I've done in like a month.
[3362.97s -> 3364.49s]  That was the dumbest thing I've done in like two months.
[3365.29s -> 3370.94s]  Why did I do that?
[3371.58s -> 3375.64s]  I used to do that shit in Mario 3.
[3376.44s -> 3377.80s]  My Super Mario world, right?
[3378.60s -> 3381.80s]  You would like do the boing, boing, boing.
[3381.80s -> 3383.72s]  And you didn't even care where you were going.
[3383.72s -> 3385.00s]  You just knew you were going right.
[3385.72s -> 3404.66s]  I'm gonna, you gotta be, that doesn't make any sense.
[3404.66s -> 3405.62s]  I can't feel it.
[3405.62s -> 3407.30s]  You can't stop a ground pound, dude.
[3411.24s -> 3413.00s]  Now I'm just, okay, I'm pissed right now.
[3413.00s -> 3414.36s]  It's B, B, okay.
[3415.16s -> 3418.68s]  B is do big jump, but B is also ground pound.
[3419.24s -> 3422.52s]  So I keep hitting like, okay, I'm gonna do a jump and I'm holding B
[3422.52s -> 3424.52s]  and I'm still holding B, but I accidentally touched it again.
[3432.25s -> 3436.25s]  Oh, a shitty craftsman blames his tools.
[3439.69s -> 3446.07s]  It's not hard at all.
[3446.07s -> 3446.79s]  I just can't do it.
[3455.62s -> 3456.18s]  Oh, wait.
[3456.18s -> 3457.62s]  It's right bumper.
[3457.62s -> 3458.50s]  Oh, that's way better.
[3458.50s -> 3459.06s]  Okay, thank you.
[3459.78s -> 3468.18s]  Oh my God, I pressed.
[3468.18s -> 3469.94s]  Okay, I swear to God, I'm not doing this on purpose.
[3469.94s -> 3471.62s]  I flipped it.
[3471.62s -> 3477.34s]  Why is Switch, I swear to God, I'm not doing this for like funny.
[3477.34s -> 3479.90s]  Look at this like funny compilation of this fucking idiot.
[3479.90s -> 3481.58s]  They can't play Crash Bandicoot correctly.
[3482.94s -> 3487.66s]  Why is Switch, you know, whatever the spacing.
[3503.45s -> 3506.04s]  Okay, come on, dude.
[3506.04s -> 3509.62s]  Should I go this way?
[3514.01s -> 3514.89s]  No, there's nothing over here.
[3515.37s -> 3522.63s]  That's all that's over there.
[3522.63s -> 3524.23s]  That's it.
[3526.20s -> 3528.84s]  All right, finally he made it.
[3531.10s -> 3532.78s]  Oh, this is a bad run.
[3532.78s -> 3533.58s]  Anything down here?
[3536.34s -> 3536.82s]  I don't care.
[3536.82s -> 3537.22s]  Whatever.
[3537.22s -> 3537.70s]  I'll take it.
[3538.42s -> 3545.90s]  Can I buy a skin?
[3545.90s -> 3550.82s]  I probably have enough to buy a skin.
[3550.82s -> 3557.29s]  Should I?
[3557.29s -> 3562.23s]  Look at it.
[3562.23s -> 3563.59s]  Flashback tapes unlocked.
[3563.59s -> 3565.27s]  Rewind time back to the 90s.
[3565.83s -> 3574.30s]  Play flashback tapes to experience Crash and Coco's training in Neo Cortex's test chambers.
[3574.30s -> 3575.18s]  What does that mean?
[3575.18s -> 3582.34s]  Let's find out.
[3582.34s -> 3583.22s]  Unlocking.
[3583.22s -> 3583.78s]  No, I can't.
[3584.50s -> 3586.92s]  All right, we'll go with this one.
[3586.92s -> 3588.20s]  Let's see.
[3589.00s -> 3590.20s]  Subject 218.
[3590.76s -> 3591.72s]  Flashback tapes.
[3594.14s -> 3596.14s]  Are these like super challenges or something?
[3596.14s -> 3599.99s]  This looks hard.
[3628.90s -> 3629.38s]  Cool.
[3629.38s -> 3630.34s]  Oh, I like this.
[3630.34s -> 3631.22s]  It's like a little puzzle.
[3632.10s -> 3646.89s]  Oops.
[3647.45s -> 3648.01s]  Oh, shit.
[3648.01s -> 3648.49s]  It's okay.
[3650.84s -> 3652.04s]  I don't think it's okay anymore.
[3654.74s -> 3655.24s]  No.
[3656.18s -> 3656.68s]  Shit.
[3659.48s -> 3660.28s]  All right, I'll do it again.
[3660.28s -> 3660.60s]  I'll do it again.
[3660.60s -> 3661.72s]  I'll do it again.
[3661.72s -> 3664.12s]  I thought it was going to break when I jumped.
[3664.12s -> 3666.92s]  I thought it was going to break when I jumped left and then over.
[3666.92s -> 3668.36s]  I thought that was only whatever.
[3669.08s -> 3705.77s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[3725.64s -> 3725.96s]  Yes.
[3725.96s -> 3726.92s]  Okay, I got them all.
[3726.92s -> 3789.48s]  Nice.
[3790.18s -> 3791.05s]  Got them all.
[3792.82s -> 3793.32s]  Got it.
[3793.86s -> 3794.36s]  118.
[3795.72s -> 3796.36s]  So what do I get?
[3797.24s -> 3797.88s]  I like those.
[3797.88s -> 3798.38s]  These are fun.
[3804.04s -> 3804.54s]  Cool.
[3804.54s -> 3805.88s]  What do I get for that?
[3805.88s -> 3818.81s]  Okay, hit the road.
[3818.81s -> 3821.00s]  I almost hit the boss.
[3821.00s -> 3827.37s]  Hey, Bruce Wayne here.
[3827.37s -> 3829.29s]  I'll pay you a billion dollars if you do a scorn.
[3829.53s -> 3832.14s]  I don't want a billion dollars.
[3832.14s -> 3832.70s]  I just don't.
[3845.69s -> 3846.81s]  I don't want a billion dollars.
[3846.81s -> 3847.37s]  No, fuck that.
[3848.17s -> 3848.67s]  No.
[3867.32s -> 3868.28s]  Look at these levels.
[3872.60s -> 3874.60s]  Look at how many baseball streams you could do with that.
[3875.32s -> 3876.63s]  Oh, okay.
[3876.63s -> 3879.75s]  Are you talking about like a personal income?
[3879.75s -> 3880.95s]  Like personal money you get?
[3880.95s -> 3883.83s]  Or are you talking about like financing stuff?
[3885.11s -> 3887.96s]  How did I go behind that?
[3887.96s -> 3890.28s]  Are you talking about like company?
[3890.28s -> 3895.34s]  Like I got a billion dollar company and I can make like whatever I want.
[3898.28s -> 3898.84s]  I don't want...
[3898.84s -> 3901.08s]  I don't personally want a billion dollars.
[3901.88s -> 3904.68s]  But if I had like a billion dollar valued company...
[3905.48s -> 3906.36s]  Okay, well, what?
[3906.36s -> 3907.40s]  How many employees do I have?
[3907.40s -> 3909.00s]  What do my sales look like?
[3909.00s -> 3910.44s]  I don't want a fucking billion dollars.
[3910.44s -> 3910.94s]  No way.
[3913.24s -> 3916.44s]  When you cross the billion dollar threshold, that's when you start to go like...
[3916.44s -> 3921.66s]  Oh, you know, I had a dream that I had a bowling alley in my fucking living room.
[3921.66s -> 3922.46s]  So I'm going to do it.
[3922.46s -> 3923.66s]  It's like, I don't know, man.
[3923.66s -> 3924.94s]  I don't want to do that.
[3925.66s -> 3928.60s]  Hey, you know what?
[3928.60s -> 3932.38s]  I feel like this very specific type of cheese this afternoon.
[3932.46s -> 3933.26s]  Get it!
[3933.26s -> 3937.18s]  And like somebody gets on a plane and flies to get this cheese from Italy to bring it to you.
[3937.18s -> 3938.58s]  Because you wanted it today.
[3938.58s -> 3939.38s]  I don't know.
[3939.38s -> 3940.50s]  I feel like that's too much.
[3940.50s -> 3941.86s]  I think it's way too much power.
[3941.86s -> 3942.60s]  I don't want it.
[3944.63s -> 3945.37s]  And I died.
[3953.51s -> 3955.11s]  Oh, there is a jump on the head.
[3955.11s -> 3955.61s]  Okay.
[3956.07s -> 3967.46s]  Stupid.
[3967.46s -> 3969.86s]  If I ever had a billion dollars in money...
[3971.61s -> 3972.81s]  I'm being completely honest.
[3973.61s -> 3975.61s]  I would take 10 million.
[3976.25s -> 3977.05s]  No, 20 million.
[3977.69s -> 3978.19s]  Yeah.
[3979.46s -> 3981.62s]  I would take 20 million dollars and just keep it.
[3981.94s -> 3982.74s]  Anything I ever wanted.
[3983.86s -> 3984.98s]  And then I would just like, I don't know.
[3984.98s -> 3988.66s]  I would go try to rebuild as many schools in America as I could.
[3988.66s -> 3989.14s]  Right?
[3989.14s -> 3990.50s]  Just like, just do it.
[3992.30s -> 3993.82s]  But I'm keeping 25 million.
[3993.82s -> 3994.46s]  I am.
[3994.46s -> 3994.96s]  I'm sorry.
[3995.90s -> 3997.50s]  No, maybe 50.
[3999.22s -> 4000.34s]  I would, I want 50.
[4000.34s -> 4001.70s]  Why can I not kill this fucking guy?
[4002.42s -> 4005.70s]  That's like two schools.
[4005.70s -> 4010.25s]  Well, I don't know.
[4011.05s -> 4011.85s]  How much?
[4011.85s -> 4014.65s]  Okay, you had 800 million dollars.
[4016.30s -> 4020.74s]  Like, could you cover like half the textbooks
[4020.74s -> 4023.06s]  that like college students would need to buy in America?
[4023.06s -> 4023.78s]  How much would you need?
[4024.50s -> 4029.51s]  And it'd be like, it'd be like the, I don't know.
[4030.39s -> 4030.89s]  No.
[4031.67s -> 4033.03s]  Would that be for like one school?
[4036.04s -> 4036.76s]  No, it would.
[4036.76s -> 4039.56s]  A billion dollars to buy text?
[4039.56s -> 4040.12s]  No way.
[4040.12s -> 4041.00s]  For one school?
[4041.00s -> 4042.68s]  What the fuck's happening to your education?
[4043.56s -> 4047.94s]  I've touched that every time.
[4048.66s -> 4059.66s]  Anything else?
[4059.66s -> 4061.85s]  Yeah, I'm keeping 20 million.
[4062.49s -> 4069.45s]  You bet your ass I'm going to buy that vintage Pac-Man machine.
[4070.41s -> 4071.61s]  Signed by Pac-Man.
[4076.15s -> 4094.07s]  You know I'm buying that.
[4094.07s -> 4094.95s]  The Pac-Man?
[4094.95s -> 4095.91s]  That's what I'm saying.
[4095.91s -> 4103.91s]  A tape?
[4103.91s -> 4107.42s]  How come I can't get this?
[4107.42s -> 4111.67s]  Why is it grayed out?
[4111.67s -> 4118.95s]  How come you, why are you acting like you're not already a billionaire cheese heir?
[4119.83s -> 4138.31s]  Oh shit, should have done that.
[4138.31s -> 4141.77s]  I have to come back.
[4141.77s -> 4143.91s]  I think, yeah.
[4144.63s -> 4149.67s]  Okay, I got it.
[4149.67s -> 4153.88s]  Do you not have any makeup on today?
[4153.88s -> 4155.16s]  No, I shaved my face.
[4156.20s -> 4157.32s]  Yes, guys.
[4157.80s -> 4158.76s]  I'm way far behind.
[4159.48s -> 4163.90s]  Guys, humans look a little different when they change their hairstyle and their facial hair.
[4165.22s -> 4171.27s]  Shaved the makeup off.
[4171.27s -> 4173.59s]  Oh, hold on, I got a face of makeup on.
[4173.59s -> 4174.71s]  It's time to shave it.
[4179.34s -> 4180.46s]  Wait, no, I'm just wrong.
[4181.10s -> 4184.86s]  Where's the thing?
[4184.86s -> 4185.26s]  Back here?
[4189.27s -> 4199.77s]  There, okay.
[4199.77s -> 4200.17s]  Let's go.
[4200.73s -> 4207.38s]  Okay, didn't hit it.
[4207.38s -> 4211.67s]  Looks good.
[4211.67s -> 4213.48s]  Am I doing this right though?
[4213.48s -> 4213.80s]  I don't know.
[4221.88s -> 4222.44s]  Kind of afraid.
[4226.34s -> 4230.46s]  Guys, you have to slide and just jump.
[4231.02s -> 4231.50s]  Can you do it?
[4233.08s -> 4234.12s]  Okay, I can do a slide jump.
[4236.62s -> 4237.50s]  Like Breath of the Wild?
[4241.56s -> 4242.28s]  Maybe eventually.
[4242.84s -> 4248.60s]  Do I have this first part accurate though?
[4248.60s -> 4250.12s]  I don't want to step on this yet, right?
[4250.76s -> 4255.77s]  I think that's correct.
[4255.77s -> 4257.77s]  And then I get these and then I step on it.
[4257.77s -> 4274.15s]  Okay.
[4277.40s -> 4279.00s]  Oh my god, how did I not die?
[4279.80s -> 4285.70s]  All right, now I go turn them back on, right?
[4288.50s -> 4290.26s]  I turn it on because now I have to destroy them.
[4303.93s -> 4307.05s]  Okay, nice.
[4307.61s -> 4308.09s]  There it is.
[4308.65s -> 4309.05s]  All right.
[4309.61s -> 4313.18s]  What are you doing?
[4314.14s -> 4332.84s]  I just, shit, I fucked it up.
[4338.10s -> 4338.98s]  I just poured.
[4339.62s -> 4342.50s]  I just opened up the spout and went over to a chef.
[4343.30s -> 4347.46s]  Making like a three-day fuck and just jumped salt in it.
[4348.42s -> 4349.38s]  Just around the corner.
[4349.38s -> 4350.50s]  Just held it out with the spout.
[4350.50s -> 4352.58s]  Like, you ruined everything.
[4353.46s -> 4362.52s]  I have to lose.
[4363.16s -> 4374.28s]  Will the nitro destroy the blocks that aren't active?
[4374.92s -> 4381.10s]  Will that, is it, it doesn't?
[4381.10s -> 4381.90s]  No, it won't work.
[4382.62s -> 4385.94s]  They have to be active, right?
[4390.71s -> 4391.43s]  I'm gonna test it.
[4392.50s -> 4393.22s]  I'm testing this.
[4395.74s -> 4397.74s]  What even, why did it explode?
[4397.74s -> 4399.10s]  I thought I touched it.
[4399.10s -> 4399.82s]  Oh, fuck.
[4399.82s -> 4400.54s]  Okay.
[4400.54s -> 4402.30s]  I thought you had to break it to have it blow up.
[4402.30s -> 4402.78s]  No, touch it.
[4420.46s -> 4421.26s]  Relax, everybody.
[4421.82s -> 4436.58s]  Let's try this.
[4437.98s -> 4438.78s]  Don't do that.
[4439.42s -> 4443.18s]  Okay.
[4444.25s -> 4447.45s]  So, don't break anything because I don't, let's see what happens.
[4448.01s -> 4450.54s]  Did that work?
[4451.18s -> 4452.39s]  I don't know.
[4454.42s -> 4455.38s]  Did, right?
[4455.38s -> 4459.77s]  It did.
[4459.77s -> 4460.25s]  Thank god.
[4489.26s -> 4489.58s]  Yes!
[4490.14s -> 4503.83s]  Just don't get killed because I don't have a checkpoint.
[4503.83s -> 4505.03s]  This game is so brutal.
[4505.03s -> 4506.79s]  It does not fucking hold your hand.
[4506.79s -> 4509.22s]  God, that's why I like it though.
[4509.22s -> 4510.10s]  Game doesn't hold your hand.
[4510.74s -> 4516.06s]  This is brutal.
[4529.70s -> 4530.26s]  Oops.
[4530.26s -> 4536.34s]  Oh!
[4536.34s -> 4537.06s]  Swing already.
[4537.06s -> 4537.46s]  Jesus.
[4538.98s -> 4540.98s]  Oh, you can't be fucking serious.
[4540.98s -> 4543.06s]  You hit me with the, you hit me with the backswing?
[4544.97s -> 4546.57s]  You weren't even in the middle of a swing and you hit me.
[4547.37s -> 4549.21s]  Thank god I didn't have to do the bonus again.
[4571.08s -> 4571.88s]  Yeah.
[4571.88s -> 4574.34s]  How do I see the HUD again?
[4579.58s -> 4580.22s]  Okay.
[4580.22s -> 4583.02s]  Oh, that's crazy.
[4583.82s -> 4585.10s]  You should eat an apple on stream.
[4587.02s -> 4587.42s]  I don't know.
[4587.42s -> 4589.74s]  I don't know why that's a, that's a, that's a weird request.
[4590.70s -> 4591.59s]  Don't you think so?
[4592.39s -> 4597.83s]  Oh dude, eat an apple on stream.
[4597.83s -> 4598.07s]  Why?
[4598.07s -> 4599.99s]  Like that's a, that's a weird request.
[4601.03s -> 4602.39s]  And I lost because of that person.
[4602.95s -> 4610.89s]  I don't know what the fuck I thought that was.
[4610.89s -> 4611.69s]  I thought it was going to fall.
[4633.75s -> 4636.94s]  Oh, does it come back down?
[4642.10s -> 4650.14s]  Don't just have patience, please.
[4650.14s -> 4650.78s]  Eat an apple.
[4651.98s -> 4653.61s]  I don't like apples.
[4655.43s -> 4657.59s]  I like Macintosh apples and that's it.
[4658.31s -> 4660.86s]  I really like green apples are okay.
[4661.82s -> 4663.75s]  We already did the tier list thing.
[4663.75s -> 4664.15s]  You already know.
[4664.71s -> 4683.80s]  Oh my god.
[4685.54s -> 4686.58s]  Yeah, it's okay.
[4710.23s -> 4711.59s]  What the fuck, man?
[4711.59s -> 4711.91s]  What?
[4716.55s -> 4717.59s]  You aren't very good at this.
[4717.59s -> 4719.75s]  This game is notoriously difficult.
[4719.75s -> 4721.03s]  It even says it on the box.
[4721.83s -> 4732.38s]  All right.
[4732.38s -> 4733.82s]  Let me see if I can get this right.
[4737.45s -> 4737.77s]  Nope.
[4738.73s -> 4740.65s]  Um, you can't get up there from that way.
[4746.34s -> 4747.46s]  Yeah, this bullshit.
[4747.46s -> 4750.02s]  Some of you guys have told me that you have permanent fight marks
[4750.02s -> 4751.86s]  on your PlayStation 1 controller because of this game.
[4757.82s -> 4758.94s]  I just forgot how to play.
[4758.94s -> 4759.18s]  I'm...
[4780.39s -> 4782.79s]  Oh, I thought it was already there.
[4783.67s -> 4805.35s]  Wait, I need to break this.
[4805.35s -> 4808.60s]  Can I break this without breaking that?
[4809.40s -> 4809.90s]  Yeah.
[4809.90s -> 4810.46s]  Okay.
[4810.46s -> 4810.78s]  Shit.
[4811.42s -> 4817.93s]  Come on.
[4817.93s -> 4818.33s]  Hurry up.
[4830.78s -> 4831.34s]  Sorry.
[4831.34s -> 4838.28s]  How do I get up there?
[4838.84s -> 4839.80s]  I think I have to fall.
[4843.91s -> 4844.39s]  Checkpoint.
[4844.39s -> 4844.87s]  Thank god.
[4845.51s -> 4850.01s]  How do I get up there?
[4858.31s -> 4859.11s]  Ooh.
[4859.11s -> 4860.31s]  Um, okay.
[4860.95s -> 4864.79s]  How am I supposed to do this?
[4868.25s -> 4869.05s]  Got it.
[4869.05s -> 4872.86s]  Diamond.
[4872.86s -> 4873.74s]  I need to destroy this.
[4875.91s -> 4876.95s]  How am I going to do that?
[4877.67s -> 4881.29s]  How do I break that without getting hurt?
[4881.93s -> 4884.25s]  Oh, the night...
[4884.25s -> 4884.73s]  Okay, it will.
[4884.73s -> 4885.13s]  It will.
[4885.13s -> 4885.77s]  All right.
[4885.77s -> 4886.41s]  It will blow up.
[4898.78s -> 4899.66s]  Oh my god.
[4899.66s -> 4901.34s]  I didn't even see what was happening.
[4901.34s -> 4902.46s]  Did I get this?
[4902.46s -> 4905.22s]  I got that, right?
[4905.22s -> 4905.94s]  Yeah.
[4905.94s -> 4956.65s]  This game is way harder than the Spongebob game.
[4956.65s -> 4966.47s]  Come on.
[4966.47s -> 4967.11s]  Are you kidding me?
[4967.11s -> 4967.91s]  I jumped behind...
[4968.63s -> 4969.96s]  I jumped behind it.
[4970.52s -> 4973.05s]  I think I can still get it.
[4973.69s -> 4980.97s]  Yeah.
[4980.97s -> 4981.21s]  All right.
[4981.21s -> 4982.01s]  We're good.
[4982.01s -> 5004.46s]  This game's hard.
[5015.51s -> 5016.81s]  This game's kind of hard.
[5016.81s -> 5017.46s]  I'm scared.
[5018.58s -> 5030.92s]  Okay, you can still jump.
[5030.92s -> 5031.72s]  I didn't think you could.
[5050.95s -> 5059.90s]  It's hard to get all those.
[5059.90s -> 5061.42s]  That's so fucking hard.
[5061.42s -> 5065.02s]  Part two.
[5079.58s -> 5080.06s]  Jesus.
[5087.83s -> 5088.23s]  Nice.
[5089.22s -> 5089.54s]  Oh.
[5091.38s -> 5110.17s]  How come there's no taunt?
[5110.17s -> 5111.29s]  I can't be like...
[5111.29s -> 5111.85s]  Boom.
[5111.85s -> 5115.58s]  It should be.
[5115.58s -> 5116.38s]  That's unfortunate.
[5116.38s -> 5117.18s]  It's okay.
[5117.18s -> 5118.12s]  That's still a lot.
[5118.76s -> 5125.72s]  You get this game for a kid that you hate.
[5126.20s -> 5127.14s]  What?
[5127.14s -> 5132.18s]  The game's very good.
[5132.18s -> 5135.35s]  It's a very...
[5135.35s -> 5136.79s]  This is a very good game.
[5136.79s -> 5148.79s]  All right.
[5148.79s -> 5149.19s]  This is it.
[5149.75s -> 5150.22s]  All right.
[5150.22s -> 5158.66s]  Let's switch to this one.
[5158.66s -> 5160.55s]  All right.
[5160.55s -> 5161.03s]  This is a boss.
[5161.59s -> 5161.99s]  Let's do it.
[5178.50s -> 5180.10s]  Rocket head.
[5196.57s -> 5196.97s]  All right.
[5206.34s -> 5206.74s]  All right.
[5206.74s -> 5207.14s]  Target.
[5207.70s -> 5209.43s]  Oh, I got to get up there.
[5209.43s -> 5209.75s]  All right.
[5209.75s -> 5209.91s]  Go.
[5213.00s -> 5214.04s]  Come on, Crash.
[5214.04s -> 5214.52s]  Hurry.
[5220.02s -> 5221.30s]  Come on, Crash.
[5221.30s -> 5221.70s]  Hurry.
[5224.01s -> 5225.93s]  Oh, I hit the fucking back of the head.
[5236.84s -> 5238.04s]  Come on, Sora.
[5238.68s -> 5241.10s]  I didn't get the Sora right,
[5241.10s -> 5241.90s]  but I got everything else.
[5242.46s -> 5259.61s]  You're going to throw somebody out here already?
[5260.33s -> 5262.79s]  All right.
[5262.79s -> 5263.51s]  Let's go.
[5263.51s -> 5269.50s]  Oh, shit.
[5270.14s -> 5280.79s]  Play Kingdom Hearts?
[5282.10s -> 5282.42s]  No.
[5282.42s -> 5282.98s]  I'm sorry.
[5282.98s -> 5286.90s]  I don't have a spare 400 hours to play that on stream.
[5290.76s -> 5292.44s]  That's just for the opening cut scene.
[5292.44s -> 5294.20s]  So I just don't have time for that.
[5295.08s -> 5295.64s]  Oh, my God.
[5295.64s -> 5295.96s]  I died.
[5296.68s -> 5299.93s]  Did I start over?
[5299.93s -> 5300.17s]  No.
[5322.09s -> 5324.09s]  Kingdom Hearts 2.
[5324.97s -> 5326.94s]  That's all I remember.
[5339.45s -> 5339.85s]  One more.
[5342.95s -> 5343.59s]  Oh, shit.
[5345.38s -> 5346.02s]  Oh, okay.
[5346.90s -> 5348.58s]  Excuse me.
[5349.06s -> 5358.60s]  This is some frogger shit right now.
[5364.55s -> 5365.19s]  Oh, my God.
[5365.19s -> 5366.07s]  I missed that.
[5366.07s -> 5375.14s]  Where did they go?
[5377.18s -> 5378.06s]  Are you kidding me?
[5394.36s -> 5409.77s]  Oh, what a bad place to stop for a second.
[5409.77s -> 5419.24s]  See you.
[5419.96s -> 5429.14s]  Phase two?
[5433.85s -> 5434.41s]  I don't think so.
[5471.32s -> 5472.84s]  Oh, I like the way this one looks.
[5476.89s -> 5477.61s]  Cool.
[5477.61s -> 5482.28s]  Booty calls.
[5482.84s -> 5488.31s]  And he looks so proud of himself.
[5489.11s -> 5501.02s]  Mom said it was my turn.
[5501.66s -> 5508.06s]  Well, it can be all of our turns.
[5508.86s -> 5509.58s]  It's cloud gaming.
[5520.94s -> 5536.87s]  Whoa, I don't think I can hurt them.
[5536.87s -> 5537.83s]  Are you high?
[5537.83s -> 5545.75s]  No.
[5545.75s -> 5546.79s]  Yeah, what a great idea.
[5550.39s -> 5553.90s]  You honestly think that would be a smart decision today?
[5554.54s -> 5555.98s]  Do you think that's a good idea today?
[5556.62s -> 5557.10s]  Think about it.
[5557.10s -> 5560.62s]  I want you to I just want you to think about what you just said.
[5560.62s -> 5561.98s]  I want you to think it's a good idea.
[5562.95s -> 5564.39s]  I don't think the answer is yes.
[5565.11s -> 5569.06s]  I think the answer is a 100% no.
[5575.69s -> 5576.41s]  Yeah, fucking.
[5578.58s -> 5580.26s]  Fuck your rivers of blood bullshit.
[5580.82s -> 5583.56s]  Should get the past that shit out of the game already.
[5592.87s -> 5596.02s]  They did good.
[5609.50s -> 5610.22s]  Oh, you can hit me.
[5610.22s -> 5612.04s]  Let's go.
[5612.04s -> 5612.84s]  I like this outfit.
[5614.79s -> 5616.15s]  You don't play Elden Ring anymore.
[5618.42s -> 5622.26s]  Yeah, because I need to forget every single thing that happens in the game.
[5622.90s -> 5626.02s]  And then once every year or two, go back and play the whole thing again.
[5626.66s -> 5629.99s]  That's how it works.
[5630.63s -> 5632.34s]  Did I get this?
[5632.34s -> 5636.10s]  I guess I already got it.
[5636.10s -> 5644.34s]  The best part about the from software games is you just forget about them for a year or two.
[5645.32s -> 5647.96s]  Come back and play a class you never played before.
[5647.96s -> 5650.20s]  And it's just a completely different video game.
[5651.08s -> 5653.74s]  It's the best way to do it.
[5657.10s -> 5657.82s]  All right.
[5657.82s -> 5660.14s]  Can I even attack this guy or jump on his head?
[5660.14s -> 5660.38s]  Right.
[5664.66s -> 5665.78s]  The DLC is coming.
[5669.58s -> 5670.54s]  Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[5671.10s -> 5688.62s]  Getting up here.
[5692.82s -> 5694.26s]  Did you do me strong?
[5694.26s -> 5694.90s]  No, I didn't.
[5697.13s -> 5698.49s]  I floundered.
[5698.49s -> 5699.77s]  I flaked on me strong.
[5711.38s -> 5712.90s]  Oh, should I just die?
[5712.90s -> 5713.38s]  Just die.
[5717.90s -> 5720.46s]  That's I don't want to miss that way too important.
[5733.75s -> 5740.79s]  Okay.
[5740.79s -> 5742.55s]  Why would it be a question mark if I know what it is?
[5743.27s -> 5753.93s]  Excuse me.
[5753.93s -> 5755.05s]  How do I get over there?
[5755.05s -> 5756.38s]  Did you see that?
[5761.05s -> 5762.25s]  Oh, my goodness.
[5762.25s -> 5772.98s]  Well, I couldn't know.
[5772.98s -> 5782.33s]  That was hard.
[5782.33s -> 5784.17s]  Actually getting 100% there would be difficult.
[5784.17s -> 5786.41s]  And there was a whole nother thing of that section with.
[5787.53s -> 5790.12s]  You know what I mean?
[5790.84s -> 5793.10s]  You know what I'm saying?
[5793.10s -> 5800.02s]  It was very pretty.
[5804.38s -> 5807.34s]  Everything from here to all the way down there looks really nice.
[5808.06s -> 5810.20s]  You know what I'm saying?
[5810.20s -> 5812.04s]  Webcam is getting annoying.
[5812.04s -> 5812.92s]  Hold on.
[5812.92s -> 5819.45s]  We got to change this better.
[5819.45s -> 5823.21s]  Not as much movement.
[5823.21s -> 5824.17s]  Yeah, that's better.
[5834.60s -> 5836.92s]  The lights are going down for Gotham Knights, though.
[5836.92s -> 5837.56s]  You better believe it.
[5844.74s -> 5851.16s]  And by the way, nobody said anything about the shirt today.
[5851.96s -> 5867.56s]  Can we please get a Bane impression during the Gotham Knights game?
[5868.82s -> 5869.54s]  Yeah.
[5869.54s -> 5878.33s]  Which one?
[5878.33s -> 5880.17s]  Do you want the iconic today?
[5880.89s -> 5881.13s]  Right.
[5881.77s -> 5882.81s]  That's the iconic line.
[5883.53s -> 5884.09s]  I can do that.
[5885.19s -> 5886.23s]  I think I can handle that.
[5899.22s -> 5900.10s]  That was a bad idea.
[5900.10s -> 5901.14s]  I'm in trouble.
[5901.14s -> 5901.88s]  Does it come back?
[5905.00s -> 5905.48s]  Thank God.
[5918.44s -> 5918.76s]  Troll.
[5935.45s -> 5937.93s]  Dude, there's no opportunity to go anywhere.
[5937.93s -> 5940.81s]  I'm going back because I don't want to miss any cubes.
[5941.45s -> 5945.99s]  I don't care.
[5945.99s -> 5973.18s]  I have the exact same acne as you right now.
[5973.18s -> 5982.58s]  You mean this?
[5982.58s -> 5985.64s]  No, I caught myself shaving.
[5985.64s -> 5997.62s]  That's a shave cut.
[5997.62s -> 5998.82s]  Yeah, that's a shave cut.
[5998.82s -> 6006.09s]  It's a giant pimple.
[6006.09s -> 6006.65s]  It's not.
[6006.65s -> 6008.09s]  It's a shaving.
[6008.09s -> 6015.90s]  We'll blow that one up, too.
[6015.90s -> 6028.17s]  Okay.
[6028.17s -> 6035.19s]  What do we do about this?
[6035.19s -> 6041.30s]  Why was it there the last time when you had facial hair?
[6041.30s -> 6045.75s]  It wasn't.
[6045.75s -> 6052.34s]  How do I break that without getting hurt?
[6052.34s -> 6052.66s]  It was.
[6052.66s -> 6053.62s]  No, it wasn't.
[6053.62s -> 6063.34s]  It was not.
[6063.34s -> 6074.94s]  22.
[6074.94s -> 6075.50s]  There it is.
[6075.50s -> 6078.52s]  How do I get out of here?
[6083.77s -> 6085.61s]  We should grow a Gandalf beard.
[6086.17s -> 6096.26s]  I don't know.
[6096.26s -> 6101.54s]  If I grew a Gandalf beard, I probably would get it all scooped up and twist it and put
[6101.54s -> 6105.94s]  it in my mouth and be like, oh, oh, I don't know.
[6105.94s -> 6107.62s]  And people would be like, what the fuck is he doing?
[6110.06s -> 6111.82s]  How did you start choking on your beard?
[6157.85s -> 6159.69s]  Dude, bro, how did that even happen?
[6161.21s -> 6162.17s]  How did that happen?
[6184.71s -> 6186.79s]  It's not even that fucking funny.
[6186.79s -> 6189.35s]  It's just everybody hates it.
[6189.35s -> 6190.95s]  Everyone's fucking pissed.
[6191.91s -> 6193.43s]  That's what's doing it for me right now.
[6193.43s -> 6195.11s]  Everybody is pissed that I just said that.
[6196.60s -> 6197.56s]  That's so stupid.
[6197.56s -> 6198.68s]  Why are we so mad?
[6204.44s -> 6205.80s]  Okay, I'm going to play the game.
[6212.52s -> 6213.24s]  Huh?
[6213.24s -> 6222.38s]  Dude, I just keep picturing.
[6222.38s -> 6223.50s]  I pictured Gandalf.
[6224.54s -> 6228.62s]  I keep seeing Gandalf in my head with his whole beard in his mouth.
[6228.62s -> 6236.06s]  And he's going like, and they come into the room like Frodo and Sam and they're like,
[6236.06s -> 6237.50s]  Gandalf, what's happening?
[6238.38s -> 6243.02s]  Ah, he's like freaking out running around like smash and bumping into bookshelves and shit.
[6244.86s -> 6246.86s]  Who told you that must have been a ringwraith?
[6259.50s -> 6283.16s]  No, I told you it was a weird day today.
[6284.33s -> 6285.13s]  I did warn you.
[6285.13s -> 6286.09s]  I was very clear.
[6287.69s -> 6288.89s]  Why are you still laughing at it?
[6288.89s -> 6290.25s]  I don't fucking know, dude.
[6290.25s -> 6290.81s]  I don't know.
[6291.69s -> 6292.73s]  I don't, I don't know.
[6293.45s -> 6299.19s]  It's because the chat's reaction was too good.
[6308.41s -> 6308.97s]  Stop.
[6308.97s -> 6309.93s]  I hit him with that.
[6334.81s -> 6343.40s]  I feel like something's hidden up here, right?
[6343.40s -> 6344.20s]  No?
[6344.20s -> 6350.84s]  Three?
[6350.84s -> 6351.16s]  Nice.
[6351.16s -> 6351.88s]  Okay.
[6351.88s -> 6354.41s]  Grabbed my nose.
[6354.41s -> 6355.21s]  I don't know.
[6355.21s -> 6356.50s]  That's a lot of money.
[6361.72s -> 6364.36s]  Dude, Frog Detective 3 is coming out on October 26th.
[6364.36s -> 6367.46s]  Please, you're going to play it, right?
[6367.46s -> 6368.98s]  Um, yeah, probably.
[6382.31s -> 6384.39s]  All right, let me get to the end of this section.
[6384.39s -> 6385.35s]  Let me do the boss here.
[6385.99s -> 6386.79s]  This is a great game.
[6386.79s -> 6387.19s]  I like it.
[6387.91s -> 6395.62s]  I don't know.
[6395.62s -> 6395.94s]  What do you think?
[6395.94s -> 6397.38s]  Do you think we go right into Gotham Knights?
[6397.38s -> 6398.26s]  What are you guys thinking?
[6398.26s -> 6409.40s]  You guys feel good?
[6409.40s -> 6410.52s]  I want to play this for a little bit longer.
[6411.08s -> 6419.45s]  Yeah, I'll take a pee break.
[6420.09s -> 6422.09s]  Maybe in a few minutes of this.
[6422.81s -> 6427.43s]  Another, like, I want to beat the boss here.
[6429.59s -> 6430.95s]  Wait, who am I?
[6430.95s -> 6431.67s]  My new character?
[6433.34s -> 6434.62s]  This is a different character.
[6439.21s -> 6439.61s]  Who is this?
[6461.80s -> 6463.48s]  Well, I never mind.
[6463.48s -> 6466.04s]  I think the story ended pretty quickly.
[6472.62s -> 6475.42s]  Dude, I can't get the image of Gandalf out of my head.
[6475.42s -> 6476.62s]  It's up there permanently.
[6481.67s -> 6482.31s]  Hook shot?
[6489.86s -> 6490.58s]  Whoa.
[6490.58s -> 6493.77s]  Does it do damage?
[6493.77s -> 6494.81s]  It does do damage.
[6494.81s -> 6495.13s]  All right.
[6502.62s -> 6502.94s]  Cool.
[6506.44s -> 6507.00s]  Very cool.
[6516.25s -> 6516.65s]  All right.
[6517.70s -> 6518.02s]  Okay.
[6518.58s -> 6526.26s]  Ball jump.
[6526.26s -> 6530.92s]  That's pretty clean.
[6530.92s -> 6531.32s]  I like it.
[6531.32s -> 6538.20s]  Are there emotes?
[6547.27s -> 6547.99s]  That's clean.
[6547.99s -> 6549.03s]  I like it a lot.
[6549.03s -> 6550.15s]  That's a very clean move.
[6562.10s -> 6563.14s]  Come here.
[6563.14s -> 6563.94s]  I'm trying to do my joke.
[6564.50s -> 6568.10s]  I could probably do a pretty good scorpion.
[6568.10s -> 6568.42s]  I'll try it.
[6568.42s -> 6569.06s]  It's going to be loud.
[6569.70s -> 6572.47s]  I'm going to do it loud.
[6572.47s -> 6573.75s]  So just be ready.
[6574.47s -> 6577.19s]  I think I could probably do a pretty good job.
[6608.78s -> 6609.58s]  Get over here.
[6611.21s -> 6611.85s]  Come here.
[6614.65s -> 6615.13s]  That's all right.
[6615.13s -> 6615.69s]  It was okay.
[6616.49s -> 6625.06s]  It needs a little work.
[6625.06s -> 6625.30s]  Yeah.
[6625.94s -> 6633.54s]  Try to grab this stupid.
[6633.70s -> 6634.18s]  Fucking thing.
[6657.18s -> 6658.30s]  I got to go for the stun.
[6658.30s -> 6658.62s]  Stun.
[6659.58s -> 6659.98s]  Stunned.
[6661.50s -> 6665.45s]  How do I get that?
[6671.75s -> 6672.15s]  Like that?
[6672.15s -> 6672.31s]  Okay.
[6672.31s -> 6672.55s]  Cool.
[6676.66s -> 6678.04s]  Holy shit.
[6678.04s -> 6678.36s]  Okay.
[6678.36s -> 6678.68s]  I'm fine.
[6692.76s -> 6693.88s]  That thing says you're going to die.
[6694.60s -> 6704.23s]  Watch out for the shock.
[6719.59s -> 6719.91s]  Nice.
[6736.30s -> 6737.50s]  What are you talking about?
[6737.50s -> 6738.94s]  You just literally turned around.
[6756.54s -> 6757.50s]  I'm rushing.
[6757.50s -> 6778.65s]  Okay.
[6779.29s -> 6780.25s]  Don't fuck this up.
[6847.51s -> 6848.39s]  All right.
[6848.39s -> 6849.91s]  I can't touch them at all.
[6849.91s -> 6851.03s]  Even if the back is, excuse me.
[6851.83s -> 6856.74s]  You don't.
[6857.30s -> 6858.34s]  Well, I don't even fight you.
[6858.34s -> 6859.30s]  What the hell am I doing?
[6859.30s -> 6859.70s]  Who cares?
[6860.42s -> 6867.02s]  I feel like that was there for a reason.
[6867.02s -> 6867.74s]  I don't know what though.
[6868.54s -> 6871.94s]  Probably was there for a reason, right?
[6895.43s -> 6896.23s]  Oh my God.
[6896.23s -> 6896.47s]  What?
[6916.17s -> 6934.94s]  Shoot.
[6934.94s -> 6942.23s]  Much better.
[6942.23s -> 6943.03s]  Much better.
[6943.03s -> 6943.59s]  There we go.
[6952.33s -> 6952.97s]  Oh boy.
[6958.65s -> 6959.69s]  96 out of 100.
[6960.33s -> 6962.81s]  All right.
[6962.81s -> 6963.13s]  Cool.
[6963.13s -> 6963.53s]  That's good.
[6978.95s -> 6979.11s]  Okay.
[6979.11s -> 6980.23s]  Somebody's linked me an edit.
[6981.32s -> 6983.32s]  The mods just linked me a Gandalf edit.
[6983.32s -> 6984.92s]  That's not what I'm talking about.
[6984.92s -> 6985.08s]  No.
[6986.62s -> 6987.34s]  He got it wrong.
[6991.38s -> 6993.93s]  Thank you so much.
[6994.57s -> 6995.13s]  Wait.
[6995.13s -> 6996.09s]  Tana?
[6996.09s -> 6998.09s]  But you're different.
[6999.69s -> 7001.77s]  You're not from our universe.
[7004.73s -> 7006.17s]  It's good to see you guys.
[7006.17s -> 7008.09s]  It's been a long time for me.
[7008.73s -> 7010.73s]  We lost touch in your universe too, huh?
[7011.37s -> 7012.01s]  Yeah.
[7012.01s -> 7013.37s]  You could say that.
[7014.73s -> 7016.65s]  What did we like die or something?
[7016.65s -> 7016.97s]  What?
[7016.97s -> 7017.53s]  No.
[7017.53s -> 7018.09s]  Nope.
[7018.09s -> 7020.09s]  No, definitely not.
[7020.09s -> 7021.45s]  So how are things in your dimension?
[7022.89s -> 7023.77s]  The usual.
[7024.65s -> 7026.57s]  A bunch of evil scientists attempting
[7026.57s -> 7027.21s]  It's crashed.
[7027.21s -> 7028.17s]  Hawke.
[7028.17s -> 7028.81s]  Huh.
[7028.81s -> 7030.73s]  So what you're collecting?
[7030.73s -> 7031.37s]  Crystals?
[7032.25s -> 7033.13s]  Gems?
[7033.13s -> 7033.77s]  Masks.
[7033.77s -> 7034.65s]  Ooh.
[7034.65s -> 7035.77s]  Fun.
[7035.77s -> 7036.81s]  Well, good luck with that.
[7037.37s -> 7038.01s]  Wait.
[7038.01s -> 7038.81s]  You're not coming?
[7039.37s -> 7039.85s]  Sorry.
[7039.85s -> 7040.81s]  I fly solo.
[7042.86s -> 7044.78s]  But I'll lend a hand where I can.
[7045.34s -> 7047.26s]  In fact, I already have.
[7059.19s -> 7060.07s]  Oh, he doesn't really talk.
[7061.18s -> 7061.98s]  He just kind of goes like.
[7069.38s -> 7070.18s]  Ooh.
[7070.18s -> 7070.50s]  Tape.
[7072.94s -> 7073.50s]  Two tapes?
[7074.38s -> 7077.75s]  Okay.
[7078.39s -> 7080.97s]  I want to do the tape.
[7085.26s -> 7085.90s]  Oh, wait.
[7088.07s -> 7089.59s]  How come there's no other tapes?
[7089.59s -> 7095.58s]  How come you're not talking?
[7096.22s -> 7097.26s]  I am talking right now.
[7098.06s -> 7104.74s]  You have to find them in levels without dying.
[7104.74s -> 7105.54s]  Oh, shit.
[7105.54s -> 7105.86s]  Okay.
[7106.82s -> 7107.30s]  Good to know.
[7113.16s -> 7116.04s]  After this boss, we'll move on to Gotham Knights.
[7118.01s -> 7118.49s]  Seems fun.
[7127.24s -> 7128.20s]  Just tried to grapple hook.
[7128.20s -> 7129.08s]  That was a mistake.
[7130.71s -> 7131.91s]  I'm not going to get the tape in this one.
[7140.10s -> 7140.74s]  I get it, though.
[7141.62s -> 7143.54s]  I swear to God, I don't even fucking get it.
[7144.18s -> 7147.34s]  I get it.
[7147.98s -> 7148.70s]  Talk louder.
[7149.74s -> 7150.86s]  Why would I talk louder?
[7150.86s -> 7151.18s]  What is?
[7152.54s -> 7152.78s]  No.
[7153.66s -> 7155.26s]  This is the volume I'm going to be speaking.
[7155.26s -> 7162.63s]  If you've got a problem, then I don't know what to tell you.
[7168.90s -> 7169.94s]  So what characters are you?
[7169.94s -> 7171.70s]  I mean, I'm starting with Nightwing, right?
[7171.70s -> 7172.82s]  I'm going to be playing with Nightwing.
[7173.86s -> 7174.98s]  Oh, my goodness.
[7174.98s -> 7175.54s]  That was he.
[7175.54s -> 7176.34s]  What did he hit me with?
[7178.65s -> 7179.69s]  Holy shit.
[7179.69s -> 7181.61s]  I just blew off the screen.
[7183.05s -> 7186.25s]  I had like 600% in Multiverses.
[7186.25s -> 7186.89s]  Or Smash Bros.
[7186.89s -> 7187.61s]  Multiverses.
[7187.61s -> 7189.38s]  Let me say Multiverses.
[7189.38s -> 7190.98s]  I had 600% in Multiverses.
[7215.06s -> 7216.18s]  Stripe was fun.
[7216.18s -> 7217.53s]  I played with them for a little while.
[7218.09s -> 7225.26s]  I think I'm too stupid for Rick.
[7225.90s -> 7227.62s]  Too many gadgets.
[7234.76s -> 7235.64s]  Oh, my God.
[7235.64s -> 7235.88s]  All right.
[7235.88s -> 7237.24s]  This game now just got really hard.
[7237.24s -> 7238.36s]  Time to stop messing around.
[7244.17s -> 7245.05s]  Actually pay attention.
[7245.05s -> 7247.77s]  If one hit and you die, this is old retro game.
[7248.49s -> 7273.06s]  Holy shit.
[7279.45s -> 7280.25s]  Young Sheldon?
[7282.74s -> 7283.46s]  What's the reference?
[7283.46s -> 7285.62s]  Are you saying that I look like Young Sheldon?
[7286.74s -> 7288.02s]  I don't know what the reference is.
[7288.02s -> 7294.90s]  It's going to be weird.
[7295.91s -> 7296.71s]  True.
[7296.71s -> 7300.52s]  What the fuck?
[7300.52s -> 7301.80s]  Ooh, cool.
[7322.78s -> 7324.06s]  What the fuck are you guys talking about?
[7325.43s -> 7328.50s]  What?
[7328.50s -> 7331.30s]  It's not even remotely close, by the way.
[7331.30s -> 7332.02s]  Not even close.
[7353.02s -> 7356.30s]  What did I just save this file to?
[7356.30s -> 7362.52s]  Save image.
[7362.52s -> 7363.00s]  Where did it go?
[7365.99s -> 7369.54s]  Young Sheldon.
[7369.54s -> 7370.18s]  Save.
[7370.18s -> 7372.17s]  Okay.
[7372.17s -> 7377.86s]  Where is it?
[7377.86s -> 7379.54s]  I can't save this file on my computer.
[7385.19s -> 7387.99s]  Should I just call it PNG or something?
[7387.99s -> 7393.40s]  How do I get it to show up here?
[7393.40s -> 7402.76s]  There we go.
[7402.76s -> 7404.68s]  Get that fucking off full screen.
[7404.68s -> 7405.24s]  Okay.
[7406.28s -> 7407.32s]  How do you see this?
[7407.32s -> 7420.94s]  This is not even close.
[7420.94s -> 7422.14s]  It's not even close.
[7422.14s -> 7444.86s]  It's not even close.
[7444.86s -> 7484.04s]  I don't look like this kid.
[7484.04s -> 7488.44s]  I don't look like...
[7488.44s -> 7490.98s]  I don't, right?
[7490.98s -> 7494.90s]  That was actually kind of scary.
[7494.90s -> 7495.30s]  Okay.
[7495.30s -> 7499.77s]  Let's go back to what we were doing.
[7508.23s -> 7509.51s]  I have human facial features.
[7509.51s -> 7509.91s]  Oh, well.
[7510.47s -> 7513.11s]  So what?
[7513.11s -> 7515.11s]  I look like other humans.
[7515.83s -> 7516.87s]  That's weird.
[7516.87s -> 7518.76s]  I don't even...
[7518.76s -> 7519.16s]  Okay.
[7519.16s -> 7521.16s]  I don't look like young Sheldon.
[7522.15s -> 7523.75s]  I don't look like young Sheldon.
[7523.75s -> 7525.83s]  I don't look like young Sheldon.
[7525.83s -> 7526.55s]  I don't.
[7536.66s -> 7537.70s]  Holy shit.
[7537.70s -> 7538.18s]  Okay.
[7538.18s -> 7539.14s]  I didn't think I was going to blow them up.
[7540.73s -> 7542.17s]  I don't look like young Sheldon.
[7542.17s -> 7543.69s]  I don't look like young Sheldon.
[7544.25s -> 7553.66s]  We got a raid that came in from...
[7554.22s -> 7554.70s]  Who did that?
[7555.42s -> 7556.46s]  Pat stares at.
[7558.20s -> 7559.24s]  Thanks, Pat.
[7559.24s -> 7559.88s]  Welcome, everybody.
[7560.52s -> 7563.45s]  Did you come to the young Sheldon part?
[7567.03s -> 7568.31s]  What the fuck did I do that for?
[7595.08s -> 7595.48s]  I can't...
[7595.48s -> 7596.20s]  But I...
[7596.20s -> 7596.76s]  All right.
[7596.76s -> 7598.44s]  I'll do this one more time.
[7598.44s -> 7601.43s]  I'm going to do this one more time
[7601.43s -> 7603.11s]  because there's another person, apparently,
[7603.11s -> 7604.71s]  that I look just like.
[7604.71s -> 7607.21s]  And we're going to find out who that is.
[7607.77s -> 7608.57s]  This apparently...
[7608.57s -> 7610.41s]  I look just like this, too.
[7610.41s -> 7633.67s]  What angle is this?
[7637.29s -> 7637.53s]  No.
[7637.53s -> 7638.65s]  What the fuck was that face?
[7638.65s -> 7639.69s]  That's like the Joker.
[7721.40s -> 7722.68s]  That's not my webcam.
[7722.68s -> 7723.80s]  I thought it was for a second.
[7723.80s -> 7723.96s]  Okay.
[7723.96s -> 7724.60s]  Hold on.
[7724.60s -> 7735.45s]  Oh, shit.
[7735.45s -> 7736.41s]  I stretched it.
[7736.41s -> 7743.75s]  Is that normal?
[7743.75s -> 7745.99s]  It's weird how just simply stretching a little bit
[7745.99s -> 7747.35s]  makes you look so fucked up.
[7747.35s -> 7750.33s]  All right.
[7750.33s -> 7750.97s]  That was fun.
[7750.97s -> 7758.97s]  Something's still wrong, though.
[7758.97s -> 7778.07s]  Should I keep this for the Gotham Knights portion?
[7780.73s -> 7782.65s]  My head's a little too squished.
[7782.65s -> 7787.83s]  It's like, why is my face so thin?
[7787.83s -> 7789.35s]  I actually don't think I can get this right.
[7789.35s -> 7790.14s]  There we go.
[7790.14s -> 7820.76s]  That's fine.
[7820.76s -> 7822.92s]  Dude, can I like take a portion of the webcam
[7822.92s -> 7825.00s]  and make my like forehead bigger?
[7825.00s -> 7826.68s]  You know what I mean?
[7826.68s -> 7828.28s]  Just have like a big forehead.
[7831.77s -> 7832.57s]  Maybe.
[7832.57s -> 7842.78s]  Dude, I can't.
[7842.78s -> 7843.18s]  Okay.
[7843.18s -> 7846.06s]  Pay attention for one goddamn second of your life.
[7846.78s -> 7848.46s]  I have to just jump over there and wait.
[7869.56s -> 7870.60s]  Dude, big cheeks.
[7871.16s -> 7907.70s]  Am I all right?
[7907.70s -> 7910.74s]  I think I got a glass of water, dude.
[7911.72s -> 7913.32s]  I need a glass of water or something.
[7913.32s -> 7916.04s]  I need like a peanut butter or like a jar of peanut butter.
[7922.71s -> 7923.03s]  Okay.
[7935.86s -> 7938.42s]  I didn't take into account the one on the left counting down.
[7938.42s -> 7939.30s]  I thought I had another second.
[7960.06s -> 7966.07s]  Oh, shit.
[7966.07s -> 7967.19s]  Hey, 29.
[7968.63s -> 7969.11s]  Yay.
[7969.91s -> 7972.14s]  The edible just kicked in.
[7977.05s -> 7977.85s]  You need peanut butter.
[7977.85s -> 7978.89s]  No, actually, that'd be messy.
[7978.89s -> 7979.53s]  No, I don't want that.
[7980.17s -> 7990.07s]  Is there a duck?
[7998.17s -> 7998.49s]  Easy.
[8015.38s -> 8016.18s]  Yeah.
[8016.18s -> 8024.12s]  I can't.
[8030.47s -> 8031.91s]  Somebody electrocuted me in my chair.
[8038.38s -> 8041.26s]  Who did the channel points to do that?
[8041.26s -> 8042.54s]  Oh, my goodness.
[8044.31s -> 8046.39s]  Dude, who had the million channel points?
[8047.11s -> 8047.99s]  What the heck?
[8049.59s -> 8050.79s]  Oh, my God.
[8051.99s -> 8052.71s]  That hurt.
[8056.92s -> 8065.50s]  Dude, how do I get those faster?
[8103.90s -> 8105.26s]  Oh, what?
[8105.26s -> 8106.86s]  I was in the thing.
[8106.86s -> 8108.06s]  Okay, I got the thing.
[8108.06s -> 8108.46s]  Goodness.
[8136.20s -> 8139.29s]  What's this?
[8140.68s -> 8142.60s]  Find the hidden green gem at another level.
[8143.16s -> 8144.98s]  Okay.
[8144.98s -> 8162.20s]  What is that here?
[8162.20s -> 8167.74s]  That's why.
[8168.54s -> 8173.46s]  Where did that just go?
[8174.02s -> 8176.54s]  Where did that go, though?
[8176.54s -> 8177.42s]  I think that went that way.
[8177.98s -> 8178.62s]  Did I miss something?
[8179.18s -> 8187.06s]  I think I missed it.
[8187.06s -> 8187.38s]  Right?
[8193.64s -> 8195.24s]  It looked like there was something over there.
[8195.96s -> 8196.68s]  It's not.
[8198.60s -> 8199.48s]  What did that activate?
[8199.48s -> 8219.66s]  What was the point of that?
[8219.66s -> 8222.36s]  What was the point of that?
[8229.45s -> 8231.90s]  What do I do with the mangoes?
[8231.90s -> 8232.54s]  I don't know what these are.
[8237.98s -> 8238.78s]  Dude, come on.
[8238.78s -> 8241.14s]  I didn't mean to press them.
[8241.14s -> 8243.14s]  I didn't mean to press that stupid button.
[8243.14s -> 8243.86s]  Stupid button.
[8244.66s -> 8245.74s]  All right.

[8349.58s -> 8350.62s]  You didn't hit it?
[8350.62s -> 8351.83s]  Oh, this is bad.
[8395.34s -> 8396.06s]  There we go.
[8396.06s -> 8396.54s]  Why did that?
[8396.54s -> 8397.42s]  It didn't happen last time.
[8397.42s -> 8397.66s]  Why?

[8416.28s -> 8422.09s]  Okay.
[8422.09s -> 8424.42s]  You don't drive into it.
[8425.06s -> 8435.35s]  Okay.
[8435.35s -> 8436.15s]  So now what?
[8442.87s -> 8443.43s]  Crash into it?
[8444.15s -> 8446.95s]  Yeah.
[8463.00s -> 8463.96s]  Oh, what?
[8464.60s -> 8477.96s]  That was not bad.
[8477.96s -> 8483.27s]  How did I miss that stupid thing?
[8483.27s -> 8484.07s]  How do I leave?
[8484.07s -> 8484.55s]  Exit game.
[8486.87s -> 8492.01s]  I like this game.
[8492.01s -> 8493.05s]  This is a fun game.
[8493.05s -> 8493.37s]  Cool.
[8526.74s -> 8528.02s]  Short and to the point.
[8528.02s -> 8528.82s]  Love this guy.
[8532.01s -> 8545.34s]  It's cool.
[8546.74s -> 8547.62s]  Why am I so stretched?
[8549.88s -> 8550.36s]  You good?
[8553.90s -> 8554.22s]  All right.
[8554.78s -> 8555.82s]  Are you guys ready?
[8556.46s -> 8560.73s]  You can't see it.
[8561.29s -> 8562.63s]  It's time.
[8562.63s -> 8563.43s]  Are we going to play Gotham?
[8563.43s -> 8564.31s]  Let's do Gotham Knights.
[8565.67s -> 8570.31s]  It's time to do the sponsor segment of today's broadcast.
[8570.31s -> 8570.79s]  Let's go.
[8575.96s -> 8576.52s]  I'm going to pee.
[8577.08s -> 8578.28s]  I'll come right back.
[8578.28s -> 8579.08s]  I'm going to get started.
[8579.88s -> 8582.20s]  And I'm going to play Gotham Knights.
[8584.26s -> 8586.10s]  And I'm going to play as Nightwing.
[8586.82s -> 8588.42s]  And I am going to.
[8588.42s -> 8590.02s]  It's going to be sick.
[8590.90s -> 8595.06s]  All right.
