[1.27s -> 10.33s]  Good... Oh, I can't say good morning. I have to say good afternoon. Sure of my might. Yeah,
[10.33s -> 18.23s]  start a little bit an hour later today than usual. Stuff to do this morning. But I've completed all
[18.23s -> 28.39s]  of my tasks and I'm ready to play a video game. In front of all of you. Today, we're gonna be
[28.39s -> 35.43s]  playing Eternal Darkness. Ssssssadities. I've not... Let's... Let's stop for... Let's hold on a second.
[36.15s -> 43.93s]  Hadn't even been one, two full minutes. I'm just gonna... We're not gonna do that yet. I promised my
[43.93s -> 49.91s]  mother that I would at least be cordial and I wouldn't be like a weirdo for the first 40
[49.91s -> 56.94s]  minutes of the stream today. Sorry, Mom. Alright, turn to Dr. Synodys Requiem. This game came out
[56.94s -> 67.03s]  for GameCube. GameCube Classic. This game, uh, fucks with you while you play it. It's by Silicon Knights.
[67.67s -> 71.83s]  You might know them as the people that sued, uh, Unreal Engine and they lost.
[74.10s -> 81.10s]  Unfortunately, that's like the biggest thing they've done. Which is sad because this game is
[81.10s -> 87.90s]  really good and I'm actually one of the weirdos that liked Two Human. I liked that game. I thought
[87.90s -> 92.62s]  Two Human was good. That was the last real video game they worked on and then they had all this
[92.62s -> 102.49s]  legal problems and then they stopped. Two Human was good. I liked it. Me and my brother used to
[102.49s -> 108.87s]  sit there and play Two Human like three or four hours a day. Now, granted that only lasted maybe
[110.06s -> 122.79s]  a couple of weeks, but if we still had fun, you're Two Human. Hold on. I have a question.
[123.67s -> 129.11s]  Hey, how is me? Alright, this is important. How is me telling you a story about how me and my
[129.11s -> 138.46s]  brother played Two Human? A minus two joke or a plus two joke for that matter. That doesn't make
[138.46s -> 143.74s]  any sense. You know, my fond memories of me and my brother playing Two Human on the couch.
[144.70s -> 156.94s]  That wasn't very funny. That was really funny. Oh, you got an emote? Wait, you got an emote.
[158.25s -> 166.49s]  Only visible to you. You got an emote today. Thanks to EX Theo's subscription. Thank him?
[167.21s -> 174.58s]  Hold on. I can say thank you. What does that do? Thanks for the hyper slam. Hold on. How does this
[174.58s -> 188.42s]  work? Okay, I just hit enter. I don't know what I did. I just apparently thanked that person.
[190.22s -> 202.25s]  Hey, thanks. Thank me instead. I don't think I've seen that before. Alright, this is Eternal
[202.25s -> 206.62s]  Darkness. Let's move over to the streaming screen so you can see what's going on here.
[207.34s -> 221.35s]  Are we kind of loud? But it's okay. I will turn it down for you. I'm ready to play. I have played
[221.35s -> 227.11s]  this game before. It was about 20 years ago as you see 2002. So it's been a while, but I want to
[227.11s -> 233.54s]  relive it. Audio not synced up. There's no audio to sync up. What are you talking about?
[238.66s -> 240.98s]  Dude, audio is not even synced up. Let's test.
[247.86s -> 252.76s]  Fuck, I just turned into the demo at Radio Shack where you go in and you press the buttons on the
[252.76s -> 267.75s]  keyboard. You press like 014 and then start hitting keys. It's fine. We're good. Radio Shack isn't
[267.75s -> 280.73s]  real. Did they go bankrupt? This wretched book is where it all began so long ago.
[280.73s -> 293.30s]  Ace Camp today? No, not today. I love Roivas. It's a great tea. Oh, he's dead.
[293.54s -> 300.25s]  This is not my story, nor even the story of the Roivas family. It is the story of humanity.
[305.61s -> 309.62s]  Your perceptions will not change reality, but simply color it.
[310.50s -> 314.54s]  Humanity has been on the edge of extinction for two millennia,
[315.42s -> 323.58s]  ignorant of so much and dependent on so few. This is a scary game. This is not a scary game.
[324.78s -> 356.38s]  Let me correct you. What's going on? It just went purple. All right. Shit. Oh, come on.
[357.43s -> 373.94s]  Don't do this to me. No, no. Stop outing me. Is it emulated? I had to, okay, because I have the game.
[373.94s -> 388.02s]  I have the disk and it wouldn't capture through my fucking capture card. We're going to get like
[388.02s -> 409.82s]  purple flashes, aren't we? No, the disk. I've already shown it. Pick up the phone. We're going
[409.82s -> 416.44s]  to get purple. Should I put like a warning that says like, hey, intermediate purple flashing?
[417.40s -> 433.56s]  Of course, it could be perfect. Yeah. Who's this? This is inspector. I'll be on the next flight out.
[434.20s -> 438.50s]  Looks pretty good though. Could have used the Wii for this. I did.
[439.46s -> 441.14s]  Here's what happened when I went through the Wii.
[447.34s -> 450.94s]  It's because of the capture card. I don't know why it's doing it. It's fucked up for some reason.
[450.94s -> 457.82s]  I trust you had a pleasant trip. Yes, I suppose so considering. Yes. My condolences. This
[458.06s -> 464.94s]  most unpleasant. It's a shame we couldn't meet under brighter circumstances. Yes, it is. Can we
[464.94s -> 469.66s]  get this over with please? Of course this way. Oh, it's only going to happen when we change to a
[469.66s -> 475.90s]  different chapter. Not a pleasant sight. Oh shit. Okay. That's not that bad. I'm afraid there's
[475.90s -> 490.68s]  not much to see. Disable what? What should I disable? Disable store XFB. All right,
[490.68s -> 493.72s]  where the fuck is that? How do I store XFB?
[502.38s -> 506.65s]  Store XFB to texture only. To avoid this.
[517.22s -> 522.10s]  I already know what happens. Her grandfather was Edgar Allan Poe and like he wrote The Raven here
[522.10s -> 526.50s]  and then the place is cursed. I don't what that's who cares. There's no head. Now none of this
[526.50s -> 531.62s]  makes sense. There's no sign of intrusion and there was certainly a lot of force used here.
[531.62s -> 535.29s]  I have never seen anything like this in my 20 years on the force.
[536.17s -> 540.57s]  We have no evidence except for the body and what's left doesn't say much.
[542.25s -> 546.17s]  We don't have a single clue. When I go on my I'll turn I'll change it.
[546.17s -> 547.93s]  I feel like that's probably somewhere easy to find in the
[548.65s -> 553.61s]  until you do go into the registry edit hold on a minute I don't want to do that in the
[553.61s -> 564.76s]  middle of the stream I want answers so do I I wish I had some two weeks later purple flash
[564.76s -> 577.93s]  incoming no we're good turn on real xfb or after okay real xfb talked by her grandfather's mysterious
[577.93s -> 583.37s]  death and frustrated the incompetence of the local police alex vows to uncover the truth
[583.37s -> 589.61s]  she decides to search the mansion the place where edward al ad edward edward ed squidward
[589.61s -> 596.44s]  alan poe conducted his research if there was a tie to his past and possibly a tie to his murder
[596.44s -> 605.93s]  we'll be here welcome to eternal darkness sanity's end okay we got to search there's a punch game
[605.93s -> 614.70s]  already has plus one letter grade what do I think about vr salmon max kind of cool I guess
[615.90s -> 626.02s]  really is kind of like resident evil huh uh this is a sword with something I can
[627.48s -> 632.20s]  oh scary whispers a wooden plaque is fastened to the door taking the place of the lock
[633.10s -> 637.66s]  colored sigil is carved into the wood above a wide slot the slot is just wide enough to insert
[637.66s -> 642.78s]  a narrow blade I need a sword to open this probably if I remember how do I run is there a run
[643.50s -> 652.46s]  yeah it doesn't run okay but what about house flipper vr I mean that's kind of cool but I
[652.46s -> 657.05s]  feel like I already know what that's gonna be like I feel like I've already played that for
[657.05s -> 668.65s]  some reason I don't know why I haven't played piano the grand pianist dancer awaiting the hands
[668.65s -> 674.33s]  of a decent musician unfortunately edward never really lived up to that description and as such
[674.33s -> 681.62s]  the piano fell into disuse I wish I could just sit down and just do like a Mozart piece right now
[682.26s -> 689.26s]  you know I really think I wish you know how games have mini games that you said you like oh wow
[689.26s -> 693.42s]  this is a cool little feature for many why how come this has never been a full piano that you
[693.42s -> 699.02s]  control with left stick and like uh the two bumpers on the left side and right stick for
[699.02s -> 705.11s]  your right hand for the right trigger and right bumper that'd be so much fun if you just I don't
[705.11s -> 711.21s]  know why no one's done that it's so easy happens in half-life alex thanks for the spoiler hey thanks
[711.21s -> 715.21s]  for spoiling the entire series of a half-life alex to me there's a piano you can play thank you
[715.77s -> 722.70s]  the illustration features a collection of strange line designs related to each other in a cyclical
[722.70s -> 727.38s]  manner there's some significance to it but it's particularly evident it isn't particularly
[727.38s -> 736.52s]  evident okay I gotta find the secrets all right so what at what point does my screen turn off in
[736.52s -> 740.36s]  like the like the kojima of like hideo blinks in the top right corner doesn't that happen in this
[740.36s -> 754.07s]  game walk a beautiful carriage clock the hands appear to be stuck and the clock continues to
[754.07s -> 760.89s]  tick with the time permanently set to 3 33 there is a key in the back of the clock presumably for
[760.89s -> 767.98s]  winding it wind the key yes alex picks up the desk clock and pulls the key from it however there's
[767.98s -> 773.10s]  something odd about the key it isn't for a winding at all it looks like a dresser key
[773.10s -> 791.82s]  nice all right open a bedroom we're gonna find bedroom bedroom one portraits of the ancestral
[791.82s -> 798.70s]  roivas line the foyer walls their faces reveal a dark brooding edge there's something about
[798.70s -> 804.79s]  each one that gives the viewer an unsettling feeling this is the luigi's mansion house
[805.43s -> 814.49s]  I mean it's every horror movie mansion is the exact same they all are the resident evil house
[815.21s -> 823.69s]  they all have this gigantic red carpet bullshit that goes up two big flights of stairs that are
[823.69s -> 829.24s]  parallel to each other and then there's two rooms on the left and two rooms on the right
[829.24s -> 833.91s]  and one all yeah one all the way down in the hallway this is how every single the horror
[833.91s -> 839.69s]  movie mansion is it doesn't matter what game doesn't matter what movie all exactly the same
[839.69s -> 856.04s]  it's identical doors locked oh I gotta go to the dresser what a worthless hallway by the way
[856.12s -> 863.91s]  this is four why not just end the wall there save yourself like fucking five grand on new building
[863.91s -> 875.78s]  costs it's a secret room yeah that's true sorry all right this is the study five grand on new
[875.78s -> 883.93s]  building costs yeah I don't know what that was what what does that mean new building costs huh
[883.93s -> 902.38s]  that was just a bad translation I was trying to say a redone kitchen the warm glow of the candle
[902.38s -> 908.74s]  light the roivas family tree hangs from the wall shadows flitter across its surface obscuring the
[908.74s -> 915.10s]  detail if one looks closely the family secrets are revealed we'll look closely oh where's the
[915.10s -> 930.92s]  bedroom door is locked how do I where's the dresser dresser no I don't care about that guy I missed
[930.92s -> 954.36s]  the door I'm gonna hurry up it's but now it's 333 forever don't worry this one hey puzzle game no
[954.36s -> 964.63s]  I'm fine oh there there this is not a puzzle game by the way this is just to remember where the door

[977.51s -> 981.35s]  okay it's time for me to be up front with you I don't want to lie I have to tell you the truth
[981.35s -> 985.91s]  I've looked at chat more time than I've looked at the screen with the game on it I swear to god
[985.91s -> 990.07s]  I've just been hanging out with you guys just looking at chat I haven't even played okay so
[990.07s -> 999.30s]  I gotta play what did I miss if you I wish I could have a I wish I could time that or something
[999.30s -> 1015.08s]  I would have what door did I miss this an eye tracker an eye tracker stream for me would be
[1015.88s -> 1024.14s]  you guys would hate it some of you guys would throw up you would just see how crazed I am on
[1024.14s -> 1029.03s]  a daily basis you'd be like wait a minute this there has to be a calibration problem how did
[1029.03s -> 1034.62s]  it go into the four corners of the screen 10 times in the last one second that's impossible
[1034.62s -> 1048.70s]  hey dude you calibrations wrong uh no it isn't that this set this time to 333 this looming
[1048.70s -> 1053.34s]  grandfather clock seems to stand ominously in the corner gazing on this empty room with an almost
[1053.34s -> 1090.39s]  patriarchal layer 333 yep the secret study don't touch that purple screen fix coming through
[1090.39s -> 1101.93s]  germawalk hold on a minute this is important oh man that I cannot can I like is that does that
[1101.93s -> 1111.34s]  person like have a sub they gave me a picture book like for a child graphics hacks bang bang

[1120.62s -> 1126.94s]  gave me in like the fucking pop-up book all right wait I gotta get to a save point before I do this
[1126.94s -> 1134.23s]  let me get to a save point first again there's gonna be a purple flash by the way I have to
[1134.23s -> 1137.43s]  warn everybody there's a purple flash that happens like when we change chapters and then I'm gonna
[1137.43s -> 1141.99s]  save the game and then bang I'm gonna go turn that off okay so just I really am warning that's not
[1141.99s -> 1148.06s]  like a joke I'm not fucking around like seriously it's bad a large leather bounty antique book open
[1148.06s -> 1173.35s]  it and it opened to 16 by 10 resolution nor did I care the knowledge changed me have to do a
[1173.35s -> 1178.79s]  while reference will also change you every single strength as you read this oh you will come to
[1178.79s -> 1185.18s]  learn hold on I'm talking over the cutscene you too will come to understand this is her voice
[1185.18s -> 1192.76s]  talking or you will perish she's reading the book purple be careful purple I'm serious that once I
[1192.76s -> 1200.68s]  could not see beyond the veil of our reality to see those who dwell behind no that's bullshit
[1200.68s -> 1207.64s]  dude nobody reads a book in their own voice for I have learned the frailty of flesh that would be
[1207.64s -> 1213.96s]  strange why would you give every character your voice one fucking purple I told you sorry it's I
[1213.96s -> 1220.09s]  told you it's coming I hope I warned you long enough here is queer scandalous there is cons of
[1220.81s -> 1223.13s]  can you imagine reading a book in your voice
[1234.68s -> 1235.08s]  yes
[1241.40s -> 1247.24s]  read books in your own voice do you believe that it really exists centurion I do not doubt our
[1247.24s -> 1253.08s]  emperor's beliefs or his orders what but if we are to retrieve the artifact hold on a minute
[1253.08s -> 1258.44s]  and we must be strong and patient so when it when a character talks in a book you don't hear
[1258.44s -> 1271.53s]  somebody else's voice you hear your voice talking what no yes yes yes what are you talking about
[1275.22s -> 1282.10s]  I when I read a book I can let's okay let's put it this way so in like the game of thrones books
[1283.26s -> 1288.06s]  when little finger talks is it you doing a little finger impression
[1288.06s -> 1302.54s]  or is it the little finger actor talking and you hear it oh I hear a little I hear little
[1302.54s -> 1323.11s]  finger talking I hear the actor talking purple be careful give me a safe one so I can fix this
[1329.38s -> 1331.70s]  cat has no inner monologue omega low
[1336.68s -> 1341.48s]  second no that's not even true everybody has an internal monologue
[1341.56s -> 1348.31s]  my internal monologue I can get to be somebody else though like okay right now I'm okay I'm
[1348.31s -> 1352.63s]  thinking of a spongebob episode with spongebob that like grabs Patrick's nose squeezes it and
[1352.63s -> 1357.11s]  says this thing's gigantic that's not me saying that in my head spongebob is saying that I'm
[1357.11s -> 1377.54s]  hearing it not Patrick Squidward whatever that's everybody has that die on this floor is finally
[1377.54s -> 1385.06s]  crafted inlet with gold and gems that we can identify strong linear design is situated in
[1385.06s -> 1393.59s]  the middle and is equally unknown to the Roman soldier on that morning radio
[1397.48s -> 1403.51s]  all right so there's the symbol it's all about the symbols in this game I do have a weapon now
[1403.51s -> 1412.74s]  though which is cool this is a cock and then there's a whip you have to manually save how
[1413.86s -> 1422.52s]  this function allows the manipulation of inventory items yeah yeah yeah okay equip the character
[1422.52s -> 1428.60s]  with a with a weapon while the examination of objects press lr by switching back and forth
[1428.60s -> 1436.06s]  between the sections all right oh shit it is there is it is a manual save all right let me

[1695.78s -> 1708.65s]  a five second slow mode so I can read chat and that'd be worse this beta represents life energy
[1708.65s -> 1712.25s]  every time a character takes damage the level will get lower when it reaches zero the character
[1712.25s -> 1721.45s]  will die okay I know what health does I mean this was 2002 right this was like 1930

[3167.72s -> 3175.66s]  nor am I sure of its end so perhaps here is the best place to start I am reminded of ideas I first
[3175.66s -> 3182.14s]  encountered in sir James George Frazier's book the golden bow a study in magic and religion
[3183.24s -> 3187.80s]  we are overwhelmed by a very human need to weave a weather of 1400s and 1500s
[3189.99s -> 3194.87s]  since time immemorial ancient peoples have dressed up their lack of knowledge
[3194.87s -> 3199.11s]  as gods and demons I have discovered that sometimes
[3199.11s -> 3205.19s]  Bible the fates of gods and mortals intertwine legends are born I guess I am just describing
[3205.19s -> 3214.74s]  the Bible I'm like yeah well I want to I want more of that though my time is done read the
[3214.74s -> 3223.06s]  bibles forever in shadow will you be master of chaos and to fade to nothing in obscurity
[3223.06s -> 3232.34s]  will be thy fate many millennia for this day it is the true chaos of all things
[3232.34s -> 3239.46s]  that you now must be entombed amongst the beings of flesh and bone see you have a great monument
[3239.46s -> 3250.14s]  here mount rock it is a pity that no lies it as yours may the darkness claim the
[3250.94s -> 3258.86s]  chaos and damn beast no longer will thy reign be kept over the ancients you have kept imprisoned

[3271.90s -> 3289.37s]  brushing all of his eyes this is purple guy so I have claimed this temple in the name of the green

[3305.37s -> 3321.64s]  all right let's go I have a weapon gonna be like puzzles here and shit in there okay a triangular
[3321.64s -> 3327.00s]  design is carved into the floor the etched grooves are filled with colored sand related to each other

[3333.16s -> 3347.45s]  that okay we are not afraid of anything red we are only afraid of blue statue of a goddess
[3347.45s -> 3353.45s]  delicately sculpted from sandstone it casts an alert eye over everyone who enters the temple
[3353.45s -> 3359.61s]  there's a strange necklace about its neck should ilia take the necklace from the statue yes
[3360.41s -> 3373.53s]  strange necklace this necklace can be used to heal elia make sure that ilia does not move when

[3450.76s -> 3455.24s]  and the character to pulse green beware sanity loss affects perception and eventually health
[3455.96s -> 3462.62s]  aren't these things in Zelda okay what just happened there's your sanity meter this meter
[3462.62s -> 3467.98s]  represents a character's sanity every time he she meets a monster his sanity or her sanity will get
[3467.98s -> 3473.72s]  lower the lower the sanity meter the more the character will hallucinate yes okay here we go
[3474.36s -> 3489.58s]  performing a finishing move on a creature recovers sanity that was fucking crazy give me that sanity

[4463.19s -> 4468.95s]  get it unless they use it to destroy the little brightness your world has left in it
[4469.59s -> 4480.86s]  it's like if the heart in your body was as big as a sunflower seed it's not even a heart it's
[4481.90s -> 4494.23s]  look at how big this guy is he's this guy is as big as three or four houses that was his heart

[4869.50s -> 4878.09s]  candles are here now all right let's see the candles small shrine of candles their placement
[4878.09s -> 4882.89s]  appears to be very deliberate corresponding to the etchings on the table and an illustration
[4882.89s -> 4891.88s]  upon the wall etching on the table illustration on the wall I already know what it is ready I
[4891.88s -> 4905.32s]  already got it I remember things the cigar with the correct sequence of candles being lit a hidden
[4905.32s -> 4913.40s]  panel opens there is a message tube found the message tube what does the message say
[4914.12s -> 4918.95s]  antique leather bound message tube the kind used to transport sealed message scrolls
[4918.95s -> 4941.54s]  it's unopened all right chapter entitled suspicious of conspiracy your presence is welcome
[4941.54s -> 4960.22s]  majesty as always I am honored my concern is with the other ancients
[4961.02s -> 4964.86s]  it's a girl in harry potter should they unite with manta rock like the ghost girl
[4966.94s -> 4968.46s]  he floats around she's talked to harry
[4973.16s -> 4998.30s]  myrtle was unaware there is nothing like that it kind of is that's pretty close that's really
[5001.42s -> 5005.75s]  the only thing we're missing is like the then what shall remain the frank
[5006.47s -> 5012.07s]  what do you intend for him the frank is an instrument of light he seeks to unite europe
[5012.07s -> 5020.55s]  under his banner when this in place my guardians will be hard pressed to perform the functions you
[5020.55s -> 5030.90s]  require for your own schemes pious think of your future then charlemagne will be removed from the
[5030.90s -> 5041.61s]  picture explain like i'm oh no that's eu moment but he was doing explain like i'm five
[5043.93s -> 5055.66s]  of course he is as good as death okay after the chapter page is removed the message tube

[5104.25s -> 5112.10s]  discard it from my research it is apparent that the endeavors of mankind are mere puppetry at the
[5112.10s -> 5121.69s]  hands of the ancients whenever a king vows reform the ancients move quickly to stifle it sorry for
[5121.69s -> 5127.21s]  that uh apologies that image i made with the fix it was incorrect the new holy roman empire
[5127.21s -> 5130.65s]  it's fine it's all right the height of its power i'm just kidding around don't worry man
[5143.96s -> 5147.48s]  will you stop reading this to our lord and emperor charlemagne the frank
[5147.48s -> 5150.44s]  no one but him must see it yeah i fixed it already i did

[5188.36s -> 5193.59s]  i'm not even sure i would tell my mother that happened what do you even do with that thing
[5197.08s -> 5202.92s]  destroy it you can't destroy it it's definitely too powerful to destroy burning it would just
[5202.92s -> 5211.46s]  make whatever god angry that you burnt it holy shit i almost punched this person after anthony
[5211.46s -> 5217.06s]  briefly describes his mission the monk informs him that charlemagne was last seen in audience
[5217.06s -> 5225.58s]  with the bishop in the visiting chamber is this why everyone was spamming for me to save the game
[5225.58s -> 5234.54s]  because i was gonna punch somebody in the face and ruin everything that's why i get it okay
[5235.91s -> 5243.58s]  thank you for the help i appreciate it i even have a punch funeral casket made from unfinished
[5243.58s -> 5248.79s]  wood it is not properly sealed should anthony open it yeah all right put the

[5263.74s -> 5270.62s]  look how his body has been defiled as if something has burst out from inside him here
[5271.26s -> 5277.91s]  take this for your protection and find the bishop yeah take this be informed of the same sword that
[5277.91s -> 5285.13s]  every single one of us and all of our ancestors ever through history that's like the historic
[5285.13s -> 5293.18s]  blade that's just passed down for 10 000 years right yeah the scrab mass six that sounds like
[5293.18s -> 5301.16s]  me trying to say a word and that's me saying it incorrectly like that's me trying to say sacramento
[5301.16s -> 5310.26s]  california that's like what i say in here in my head uh yeah i saw scratch the mass six california
[5310.26s -> 5328.06s]  i have been i've been there before it was cool oh no his brain we must warn the others
[5330.76s -> 5343.18s]  but i equipped that shit what else can i do in here i do have a map i'm just realizing this now

[5352.66s -> 5361.02s]  save that guy awful voices emanate from inside the bishop's visiting chamber however the door
[5361.02s -> 5370.86s]  is locked and anthony will need the bishop's key to enter all right oh find this key the bishop's

[5476.89s -> 5483.30s]  who actually wrote that book why would you write that book it had to have been like dictated by

[5763.02s -> 5770.01s]  with an evil fire the monk dropped the urn out of shock and ran returning to retrieve the urn he
[5770.01s -> 5775.67s]  found only the sword the bishop had left behind thanks he gives the bishop's sword to anthony
