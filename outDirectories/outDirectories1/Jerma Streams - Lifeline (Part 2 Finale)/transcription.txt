[1.08s -> 4.04s]  This shirt is like wet with sweat.
[12.82s -> 22.84s]  All right, let me set this up. See, we're just fine. Everything's fine. Put that over here.
[26.54s -> 30.54s]  There's seven fucking thousand people here. I'm gonna change it off from IRL. We're gonna go back
[30.54s -> 39.43s]  to Lifeline. I'm gonna try to finish Lifeline. Or I'm gonna try at least a handful of times.
[41.03s -> 59.70s]  Let's see. Trying to finish talk at game. Game. You look kind of pale. I feel uh, I kind of feel
[60.50s -> 73.99s]  I feel pretty good. Trying to finish to finish. That's a good title. Trying to finish
[74.71s -> 90.63s]  to finish. Right, that's literally what's going on. Lifeline. This is joke on a joke. Okay,
[90.63s -> 95.42s]  by the way, if you were participating only for the festivities of,
[97.08s -> 105.53s]  well it wasn't really festivities, it was more along the lines of just me sitting here with
[105.53s -> 112.52s]  like a bunch of goofy dumb shit on, panicking and nothing happening. So if you enjoyed that,
[112.52s -> 116.28s]  I'm glad you did. But we're gonna transition to a stupid PlayStation 2 game where you
[116.28s -> 120.68s]  have to yell at the microphone. If you want to see what it looks like, here it is.
[124.50s -> 143.91s]  Yeah! That's unfortunate. This is the microphone I have to use. It goes like this. And you have
[143.91s -> 151.96s]  to talk to the lady on the screen. Oh, but somebody's saying uh, big bits came in.
[163.93s -> 169.05s]  Ta-bunk. I might not have the right hairstyle for that. All right, let me turn on the
[169.05s -> 184.23s]  PlayStation 2. Let's boot it up. Reset transformation on that. We're gonna try to
[184.23s -> 192.26s]  just go right where we left off. Why is this so small? It shouldn't be like that.
[192.26s -> 203.70s]  The PlayStation 1 sound is better. Uh, Brolok. Brolok, you are at the 24-hour cool-off period,
[203.70s -> 210.97s]  man. That's a hundred dollars from Brolok. You are actually at the cool-off period.
[211.77s -> 219.32s]  It hasn't even been 24 hours. We got nine hundred dollars now. Nine hundred and fifty bucks.
[219.96s -> 240.71s]  Oh, nine hundred and five. God. Holy shit, man. Nearly a fucking thousand dollars.
[242.47s -> 253.42s]  Let's go. Make sure I get my tabs open because I just started here. Let's bring the volume down
[253.42s -> 266.49s]  a little. That belongs over here. But, Brolok, honestly, I really hope that you're
[267.05s -> 273.42s]  taking care of yourself first. That's an extreme amount of money to give anyone.
[275.43s -> 280.31s]  I really hope that you are within the means to give or do so. Thank you so much for the
[280.31s -> 291.48s]  ridiculous amount of money. Trying to finish to finish. We are updated with the correct information.
[300.25s -> 319.08s]  Hold on. I gotta get to the screen first. I should have all my tabs. I do. Lifeline.
[319.08s -> 326.17s]  No. Sweat check. It's the whole shirt. We can't do a check on it. It's the entire article of
[326.17s -> 335.00s]  clothing. So I have to go here. All right. We're ready to start. If you don't know what's going
[335.00s -> 345.75s]  on, Lifeline is a game where you have to speak instructions to a girl on the screen
[346.55s -> 352.02s]  and she you can't control it any other way. It's only through that. This is
[352.10s -> 355.94s]  a spoiler for this game because literally we're at the last hour or two of the game.
[356.82s -> 361.38s]  I might not even complete it because the game is a fucking mess and sometimes does not listen
[361.38s -> 375.37s]  to a goddamn thing you say. But I'm going to try. Wrong. Well, it is not wrong. It's my
[375.37s -> 389.96s]  opinion. I'm fine. I think it's a great game. I think it's a great idea. I'm not. I'm fine.
[389.96s -> 399.59s]  Make sure they can hear me. So we're at the last portion of the game. Just Broluck. Broluck. Bro.
[399.59s -> 413.75s]  Hey. Bro. Bro. Bro. Bro. You just. Broluck. That's a thousand dollars. A thousand. One
[413.75s -> 418.71s]  thousand in one day. A thousand dollars in a day. One thousand dollars in a day.
[427.10s -> 432.28s]  Broluck just donated a thousand dollars. Get up. Okay. I got it already.
[434.34s -> 436.58s]  They say, all right, man, that's it. That's it for me for a while.
[437.14s -> 439.30s]  Just letting you know that this amount is okay for me to donate.
[439.86s -> 442.34s]  Been watching you since I was in high school and you helped me along the way.
[442.90s -> 446.66s]  The tragic part is, in Australian dollars, a hundred bits is two dollars.
[447.99s -> 458.36s]  Enjoy. Oh my god. Did you. That's a. That's thousands. I hope. I hope you got some like
[458.36s -> 470.66s]  Monopoly man money because holy shit. Case three. Case three. Run. Yes. Was it 15? 50? 15?
[476.97s -> 486.98s]  It's not here. Someone's taken it already. We need to find Alan Honda.
[488.02s -> 492.34s]  You don't need to see this shit anyways. Operator, hold on a sec.
[494.90s -> 498.02s]  This cord, what is this? So many people already have no idea what's going on.
[499.22s -> 505.06s]  But it's all right. This can't be. Listen, can you analyze this device?
[508.50s -> 509.94s]  There's no time limit on here anyways.
[516.82s -> 520.58s]  Is that a good place for me to be? We're racing against time. Hurry, analyze it.
[520.58s -> 526.90s]  Okay. There's no mistake. It's a bomb. Yes, I know what it is. I've seen it like 10 times
[526.90s -> 532.74s]  now. I know it's a bomb. The sum of the last digits of today's date. Okay, you found the
[532.74s -> 536.74s]  right instructions to defuse it. Can you read them to me? Out of sync? We'll think it
[536.74s -> 554.23s]  through. Oh yeah, the webcam is. What's the first one? Now we're going. Enter the sum of
[554.23s -> 561.35s]  the last digits of today's date. Okay, yes, that's easy. Today is December 24th, 2029.
[562.31s -> 565.43s]  So the last digit of each one would be 249.
[571.03s -> 572.31s]  15, 50, 15, right?
[588.28s -> 596.38s]  Game is too loud? Yes. I got it. I got it. The music blasting.
[598.46s -> 600.46s]  All right, let's get to the part where I need to get to.
[601.94s -> 603.78s]  Enter the number of guests checked into the hotel.
[614.54s -> 616.94s]  It's not 13. She's going to stop me. She goes, wait.
[631.21s -> 633.61s]  All right, let's go. I know what it is.
[636.01s -> 639.53s]  Somebody's saying emulate this and get it to this part. Just so I'm able
[640.49s -> 644.89s]  to just go through this part. There's no other save point until you'll see what happens here.
[646.78s -> 660.07s]  50. Okay, what's the next step for diffusing this? I'm going to move some of these windows
[660.07s -> 670.34s]  around. That's back. That's a better spot for all my windows. All right. Enter the sum
[670.34s -> 682.20s]  of the last digits of PM Takayama's birthday. How old is she in the game? I actually
[682.20s -> 699.03s]  don't know. That's a good question. You need to keep moving. You need to keep moving.
[704.31s -> 711.69s]  Did he? I don't remember. I only saw it last night. I have no idea how old this girl is.
[711.69s -> 726.25s]  I don't know. This part takes 20 minutes and the part where you die
[726.25s -> 736.60s]  takes five. I know it's hell. It's hell doing this. Yes, I know. It's 15.
[737.64s -> 740.84s]  So it's left soldier, right soldier. I got to be very clear.
[744.86s -> 754.06s]  And the fact that I only have one little health bar, it sucks. No, it's not seven. 15.
[756.12s -> 759.24s]  Okay, I'm going to, I got to move this because this is old and I don't want to
[759.24s -> 765.78s]  drink out of this. This is the part that I've died out like seven or eight times last night.
[766.50s -> 771.88s]  Remember, this takes 20 minutes or so to do this part. Oh, I got to get it ready.
[772.60s -> 783.46s]  Do you like to take a break? There we go. She's going to do the whole thing with,
[783.46s -> 788.17s]  can we be friends when I get out of here? Can we be relatives or something?
[788.17s -> 799.34s]  Well, whatever the fuck she says. Yeah. Unskippable. It's crazy because select
[799.42s -> 806.14s]  skips cutscenes, but not this one and not any of the ones leading up to where I need to be.
[806.78s -> 818.10s]  For some reason they decided that that was a good idea. What am I going to say this time?
[818.10s -> 839.40s]  What do you think? Ready? I feel like I never went to bed. Is that weird? I feel like I'm
[839.40s -> 843.40s]  still here from yesterday. And you know, it's funny. It was today. It was this morning.
[844.44s -> 857.21s]  If we get back to earth safely, you think we could actually meet somewhere
[857.21s -> 865.58s]  like normal friends? Yeah. On Facebook, add me on Facebook. Look, you don't need to be a jerk.
[866.46s -> 868.78s]  I was being serious and now you make me feel like an idiot.
[875.46s -> 883.99s]  We really have to find her. We've got to Facebook. That isn't very insulting.
[883.99s -> 890.31s]  Actually, that's extraordinarily insulting. Facebook. Yeah, I'll add you on Facebook, I guess.
[895.24s -> 901.40s]  All right. Left soldier, right soldier, red lever, yellow lever, red lever, yellow lever,
[901.40s -> 910.87s]  red lever, red, shoot red, shoot red lever. Left soldier, right soldier, red lever, shoot
[910.87s -> 927.72s]  yellow, shoot yellow lever. I got it. Red lever, shoot red, shoot yellow. That's as clear
[927.72s -> 938.60s]  as I could possibly make it. Shoot yellow. Left soldier. Here we go. All right, here we go.
[938.60s -> 945.80s]  Come on. Come on. We're going to get that first try. It's not lever. That's a soap company.
[946.76s -> 947.80s]  Lever 2000.
[953.99s -> 967.93s]  Shoot yellow. Left soldier. What? Soldier. It's soldier. Red lever, red lever, left soldier.
[972.34s -> 997.75s]  No, I'm not faxing you my feet. Okay. Pay attention. Here we go. Left soldier.
[998.39s -> 1012.42s]  Shoot red. Shoot, shoot, shoot red. Shoot yellow. Left soldier. Right soldier.
[1015.11s -> 1044.81s]  Shoot. I'm not saying shoot. Shoot red. Left soldier. Right soldier. Hide. Shoot red.
[1046.89s -> 1092.07s]  Hide. Hide. Shoot red. Hide. Shoot left. Shoot red. Shoot red. The right soldier. Red lever.
[1092.87s -> 1108.58s]  But I said shoot red. Oh my god. And when you shoot the soldier, it doesn't even do anything.
[1110.06s -> 1115.70s]  You shoot them, they go, oh, and then they keep fighting you. What? It doesn't do anything.
[1116.95s -> 1124.38s]  It doesn't do anything when you shoot them. I can't fucking believe this,
[1124.38s -> 1128.95s]  that you have to do this whole thing again. Somebody just fell asleep at the at the fucking
[1128.95s -> 1133.35s]  computer to like have this be a reality. This is the only save point. You have to do the whole
[1133.35s -> 1138.55s]  entire cut scene again. Somebody fell asleep making this game. Get up. Okay, I got it already.
[1142.54s -> 1150.28s]  Case three. Case three. Okay. How do I fast forward the stream? Run. Yes. What are you
[1150.28s -> 1155.59s]  doing? What's going on with this fucking audio and video? And I don't have any health.
[1157.14s -> 1164.18s]  They made the health packs like Resident Evil 1 in this game. Like if you don't, if you run
[1164.18s -> 1173.11s]  out of them, you lose. Somebody look up those cheats for the PlayStation 2 version. No click
[1173.11s -> 1192.74s]  through the fucking wall. I don't care. I need to get a game shark. The fact that you have
[1192.74s -> 1198.90s]  to do this again. What were you doing when you made this portion? How did you think that this
[1198.90s -> 1204.34s]  was a good? How? How is it? Why would you make not have a save point? Why would you make this
[1204.34s -> 1209.70s]  the part that can't skip it? Can you read them to me? Well, we will we do it. Why would you
[1209.70s -> 1215.56s]  sit in the office? What's the first? And you would you run it? Did you run out of time?
[1217.00s -> 1225.30s]  Enter the sum of the last digits of today's date. Okay, yes. Nobody but me got to this
[1225.30s -> 1236.94s]  point. This is a speedrun of this game. Skip cutscenes with L2 and select.
[1240.07s -> 1255.82s]  Didn't I do that already? Select worked before. I used L2. No, they don't work.
[1265.88s -> 1269.80s]  Enter the number of guests checked into the hotel. Thanks for the save point.
[1281.21s -> 1291.77s]  Careful with this. Safe point. Wait a second. It's not 13. It's neither. It's the number of
[1291.77s -> 1296.89s]  checked in guests. Use the speedrun as a walkthrough. And enter that number.
[1298.09s -> 1319.19s]  I'm gonna see. I'm gonna mimic exactly what this person says. Okay, what's the next step?
[1325.32s -> 1334.97s]  I don't think there even is. Does it even exist? Enter the sum of the last digits of
[1334.97s -> 1343.29s]  PM Takeyama's birthday. What's going on with this fucking thing? What the fuck is happening?
[1344.09s -> 1355.26s]  It just got dark. Yeah, this is how it ends. It ends with me fucking snapping. I'm gonna put the
[1355.26s -> 1372.25s]  disk in my shredder. This is how what's gonna happen here. Holy shit. This cable's broken,
[1372.25s -> 1381.05s]  I think. No, it's not. I think we're good. Shred the disk. Shred this fucking disk.
[1381.21s -> 1391.08s]  You're right. Didn't he say something about that at some point? I know. I am right.
[1396.17s -> 1403.54s]  Big coffee cup. It is. I'm a streamer. We drink coffee, you know. We drink coffee and
[1403.54s -> 1409.38s]  sip on it for two, four hours straight, dude. That was a huge vein. Did you see that?
[1409.38s -> 1433.93s]  The blood pressure is rising. All right, should I? Stop talking, lady.
[1435.77s -> 1439.93s]  All right, here's what I'm gonna try. I think I'm just gonna not even worry about the fucking
[1439.93s -> 1444.41s]  soldiers. I'm just gonna shoot. I'm gonna... Red lever. Yellow lever. Red lever. Red lever.
[1444.41s -> 1449.21s]  I'm just gonna hide and shoot. Every time I try to deal with the soldiers, I say like,
[1449.21s -> 1453.21s]  left shoulder, right soldier, right soldier, left soldier, and she just doesn't shoot in
[1453.21s -> 1466.90s]  the right direction. We've seen it like five times now. You have to say shoot red. I just,
[1466.90s -> 1474.71s]  I tried that. Shoot red. Shoot red. And then everyone got mad because they're saying red
[1474.71s -> 1477.67s]  lever. And then when I do that, people get mad because they're saying shoot red.
[1483.21s -> 1488.17s]  I don't want to see this again. You can't just, while you're talking, walk over to the kiosk
[1488.17s -> 1500.86s]  and punch in the code to do the safe point. It's because I have a Boston accent. It's,
[1500.86s -> 1508.63s]  but it's, it's not... Red lever is... It's not like I'm going, ah, red lever. Open up the
[1508.63s -> 1518.18s]  red lever, dude. Red lever. Red lever. Shoot red. Red lever. That's not what I'm saying.
[1518.90s -> 1528.38s]  Oh yeah, by the way, uh, pick me up with some clam chowder while you got a chance.
[1538.95s -> 1544.63s]  Sorry my fucking Boston accent is really screwing this game up. I fucking can't help it. I say
[1544.63s -> 1554.50s]  like ahs and hs and ahs. I have not said like ah the whole playthrough. Listen to the,
[1554.50s -> 1557.70s]  listen to the sound of my voice. This is the way I've been talking the whole time.
[1561.56s -> 1565.56s]  Some of you guys are making it sound like I'm like, hey, can you like go over there
[1565.56s -> 1584.62s]  and pick up some of the thing on the ground? Don't make me make my fucking chin bigger.
[1585.34s -> 1606.49s]  You can skip it with select. Sometimes you gotta prove it on the webcam.
[1611.94s -> 1616.34s]  Is it bootleg controller? No, it's not. This is an officially licensed controller.
[1620.15s -> 1629.11s]  All right. Red lever. Red lever. I'm stuck in a time loop right now and I have to get out of
[1629.11s -> 1639.62s]  it. I'm stuck in a time loop. I'm stuck in a time loop right now. Licensed by mad cats.
[1641.46s -> 1648.04s]  I'm just gonna do it with a Boston accent. Speedrun strat is just say red,
[1648.92s -> 1651.56s]  but wouldn't that she spuck that up sometimes and think I'm saying right?
[1655.72s -> 1675.80s]  Take a med kit. I don't have any med kits. There are no med kits. There are zero.
[1676.60s -> 1739.77s]  Red. Red. Red. Shoot. Red. Red lever. Hide. Right soldier. Hide. Yellow lever.
[1743.54s -> 1760.44s]  Hide. Yellow lever. Yellow lever. Hide. You fucking assholes. Red lever.
[1763.67s -> 1786.14s]  Yellow lever. Yes. What does it say in the walkthrough? What does it say in the
[1786.14s -> 1790.30s]  walkthrough? Somebody please. I need this. I can't do this again. Please give me a save point.
[1798.47s -> 1817.78s]  What happens now? What happens now? You have to say run. Say run. Right? It was save run
[1817.78s -> 1824.30s]  when I got the opportunity. Save run. Run. Is that enough to have an accent for you?
[1826.22s -> 1830.26s]  Run. Run. Run.
[1873.74s -> 1873.98s]  Run.
[1879.02s -> 1899.98s]  Is that? Is that? Worst ending? I don't care. That took like four and a half hours to do that.
[1901.32s -> 1906.95s]  More than that. I have to let the others know. Give me a save point please.
[1907.91s -> 1913.34s]  I don't. Do you have? Why would you do this to me? There's got to be a safe point in this
[1913.34s -> 1938.38s]  room. What do I do now? What should I do? Something terrible is happening.
[1939.34s -> 1965.27s]  Run again? Should I run again? Somebody look it up for me. I don't have a computer in front of me.
[1965.27s -> 1970.23s]  I have a PlayStation 2 computer monitor screen. I don't have an actual computer.
[1971.83s -> 1981.62s]  Run. Run. Calm down. Corridor open. Wait. Hold on. Okay. Run. R.I.P. Gino. I understand.
[1981.62s -> 1985.46s]  I feel the same way. He should have been in Smash. But you got to give me the actual
[1986.34s -> 1997.16s]  thing I need to do. So it's calm down. I don't care about cheating right now because I don't
[1997.16s -> 2002.57s]  care about a thing about this. We're not doing another fucking 42 minute cut scene
[2003.21s -> 2009.96s]  scenario. It's literally sexy pose. No it's not. I'm not getting baited that hard.
[2017.16s -> 2027.77s]  No no no. Somebody just had it. You just put it in there. I can't look it up. I have no
[2037.61s -> 2042.78s]  spam to keep the advice away. I'm trying to cheat here and you're making it very
[2042.78s -> 2050.58s]  difficult for me. Okay here we go. This is I gotta I gotta walk through here.
[2050.58s -> 2061.91s]  Let's go all the way to the bottom. If it's not sexy pose. I just want to make sure you
[2061.91s -> 2080.63s]  guys are aware of this. If it's not sexy pose. I'm turning off the stream. All you're gonna
[2080.63s -> 2091.02s]  do is make a threat. Bring back the music. Okay trying to find a walkthrough of this
[2091.02s -> 2099.02s]  game is like it's not like easy to find a real one. Lifeline PS2. Well I got my
[2099.02s -> 2103.18s]  computer here. I was lying. Okay here we go. Here's a walkthrough. I don't care. I'm
[2103.18s -> 2111.26s]  gonna read this. Here's a full walkthrough. All the way to the bottom here because this
[2111.26s -> 2131.78s]  is the end of the game. There's so much more to the game. This this is like another two
[2131.78s -> 2143.16s]  and a half hours to this game. Okay use the door. Press case three. All right.
[2143.16s -> 2150.73s]  There's the shootout. The Marines show up. It's stuck. Later run when Geno fights the
[2150.73s -> 2156.81s]  alien. If you decide to stay behind and help you'll be killed. Thank god. Trust me when I
[2156.81s -> 2161.61s]  say you don't want to do this part. They actually wrote that in the walkthrough of
[2161.61s -> 2167.77s]  the game. Trust me when I say you don't want to do this part again. UGH exclamation
[2167.77s -> 2173.72s]  point. Even in the walkthrough they hate it. After it's all over tell Rio to cheer
[2173.72s -> 2184.50s]  up and on you go to the testing ward. There's been an unfortunate incident.
[2185.85s -> 2191.37s]  We set an explosive but it seems that one of your people has diffused it. What is that
[2191.37s -> 2195.53s]  supposed to mean? I never gave you orders to blow up the station.
[2198.52s -> 2206.31s]  We don't take orders from you. What? Aren't you here to rescue us? Rescue?
[2207.11s -> 2212.81s]  How presumptuous. Who on earth told you that? We are soldiers for a new world order.
[2212.81s -> 2217.18s]  Our sole purpose here is to obtain a relic with incredible power.
[2217.74s -> 2224.46s]  Having accomplished our objective we are now leaving. Alan you're with these terrorists as
[2224.46s -> 2232.70s]  well? I but I this being Christmas my gift to you is a quick painless death by one very
[2232.70s -> 2236.14s]  impressive explosion. I need to be ready to do exactly what this thing tells me to do.
[2236.14s -> 2240.38s]  Now I have no choice but to dispose of you. I just happen to do this whole thing again like
[2240.38s -> 2244.14s]  they said UGH exclamation point. Wait take me as your hostage.
[2253.45s -> 2260.36s]  What? Are you sure that I just have to cheer up while running into the fire?
[2261.00s -> 2271.75s]  Trust me to say the then witness the after it's all over tell her to cheer up.
[2285.80s -> 2290.12s]  You monsters you herded them here to kill them not for rescue.
[2291.91s -> 2301.14s]  Hey exactly and you've conveniently returned to die as well.
[2301.14s -> 2316.98s]  Cheer up tell her to cheer up. I curse you killed a great man. Curse you. I'll finish her.
[2329.85s -> 2341.16s]  Oh she's the alien. She's the alien. That's the climax of the story. I curse you.
[2342.12s -> 2363.67s]  Oh sexy pose yeah I'm sure it is.
[2368.39s -> 2371.67s]  I brew my own coffee. I brew my own coffee with my own percolator.
[2376.34s -> 2403.93s]  Only real only real coffee enthusiasts do that. I used to drink Dunkin' Donuts every
[2403.93s -> 2408.01s]  fucking day. What are you talking about? In fact I think this might even be Doug.
[2408.01s -> 2412.57s]  This is there's okay then I'm gonna return this. I'm gonna return wherever I got this
[2412.57s -> 2426.46s]  coffee. That's a hair. There's a hair in my coffee and that's a big hair. Any more hairs?
[2427.34s -> 2441.53s]  I knew it. I'm ignoring the plot. Who am I? Um okay I'm a descendant of Paracelsus
[2441.53s -> 2446.25s]  the scientist from Alan's disc. The story of Paracelsus and the philosopher's stone is more
[2446.25s -> 2454.49s]  than just a legend. It's real. It's the stone that I've been trying to find. It's an heirloom
[2454.49s -> 2460.58s]  that my family has guarded since Paracelsus time. It began to influence my life when I was
[2460.58s -> 2469.93s]  only a child. I told you guys that she was like coming to steal it. The geologist's name was
[2469.93s -> 2480.30s]  Joseph Kraft. Those two spent years researching the stone and they eventually uncovered the
[2480.30s -> 2488.70s]  secret nature of it. Physically the philosopher's stone is pretty much your basic rock but what's
[2488.70s -> 2495.96s]  uncanny about it is the composition. Completely uniform throughout. Whether stone or metal it's
[2495.96s -> 2501.72s]  impossible to manufacture solids of entirely uniform composition on earth. Why you ask?
[2501.72s -> 2507.11s]  It was a dog hair. Because of gravity. The same night they concluded their analysis of the stone
[2508.23s -> 2523.27s]  Kraft shot my dad. It was one of your nose hairs like this fucking huge. He also shot me.
[2524.07s -> 2536.14s]  I survived but my mom and dad weren't so lucky. No save point yet by the way. Kraft was trying to
[2536.14s -> 2543.45s]  steal the philosopher's stone but dad had it protected. Fearing for my safety I fled to Japan.
[2544.17s -> 2564.06s]  I just wanted to forget everything. Kraft back in cheese. But then I saw it on the news.
[2566.34s -> 2571.93s]  Oh I gotta my does my tweet say I'm doing an IRL hang up? The channel's negative or positive
[2571.93s -> 2581.30s]  emotion from spoken words. With the stone you can heal or corrupt. If I die I get to sit this I
[2581.30s -> 2585.14s]  know I don't want to sit through this again. At least according to research data taken by
[2585.14s -> 2590.68s]  Joseph Kraft. From what I can tell he used the stolen research to build a replica of the
[2590.68s -> 2598.31s]  stone in the lab on this space station. I guess with all the chaos going on he was
[2598.31s -> 2606.57s]  planning to steal the real stone and blame it on the aliens. Right I mean this is what we're
[2606.65s -> 2611.05s]  seeing. Even if that means killing everyone in the hotel to ensure their silence.
[2611.05s -> 2619.78s]  But why does he want the stone so much? I don't get it. What was he gonna do with it?
[2619.78s -> 2626.82s]  He does stop that. Turn people into hideous monsters. He would use the stone for that.
[2627.85s -> 2653.51s]  The infinity stones. Use the stone for that. Cheer up. Got it. What we need to do is find
[2653.51s -> 2661.48s]  Alan's stone and dispose of it. Actually that can wait. I'm sorry I've been so caught up in
[2661.48s -> 2672.73s]  the stone I still have to get you out of there. And Naomi too. To make super mac and cheese.
[2672.73s -> 2684.62s]  But listen in spite of all our searching we haven't found your girlfriend.
[2685.26s -> 2690.95s]  Yeah that's right. You know what's happening. I mean I know the philosophy of stone and
[2691.43s -> 2698.78s]  all that but my girlfriend is missing. That alien. Is it some kind of mutated person that's chasing us?
[2699.90s -> 2713.99s]  Could it be? Sorry. I'm sorry. What am I saying? Good you should be. There's still the testing
[2713.99s -> 2722.04s]  ward left. That's it she must be in the testing ward. The monitor room you're in it's in the
[2722.04s -> 2726.92s]  testing ward. She's in the oh she's in the room I'm in? She's been here the whole time?
[2727.88s -> 2733.96s]  Naomi. What? Oh yeah she is. She's in a fucking cryogenic lab behind me. The three of us can
[2733.96s -> 2740.26s]  leave this place together. Go get her now. I can get to the testing ward on that elevator.
[2740.90s -> 2758.60s]  Wait for me. Save point please. Please god. If an enemy spawns right here we'll get another
[2758.60s -> 2766.79s]  cutscene too. Another one. Is there no save point? Is this the end of the game and if we
[2766.87s -> 2776.36s]  fuck up we go all the way back? There's only the testing ward left. This is it I think.
[2777.00s -> 2784.23s]  There's no gravity but I can use an air shooter for moving. No problem. One hp.
[2785.53s -> 2799.86s]  No save points. 27 full minutes of cutscenes. If we lose. Shredding disc on stream.
[2799.86s -> 2816.18s]  This is pretty much what it is. Can you open this case? Get. Grab it. That just gave me so much anxiety.
[2816.18s -> 2834.20s]  Thanks. This solves the problem of zero gravity. Wait. Stop. Yep. Where's the save point? There's
[2834.20s -> 2858.02s]  no save point. Hatch three has hp. The guide says there is a there is one. If I'm getting
[2858.02s -> 2862.90s]  baited into opening up a hatch I'm looking at my own goddamn walkthrough. I don't trust
[2862.90s -> 2870.68s]  a soul here. Not in a million years right now. A million. We're talking about a million
[2870.76s -> 2904.39s]  years. I don't trust what you guys are saying right now. There is a heal. Hatch five. Hatch five.
[2906.55s -> 2915.13s]  Run. Oh you can't run. You can just do you can just do the the uh all right.
[2915.93s -> 2919.45s]  I have to make this reference and I have to make this joke. If you haven't seen the last
[2919.45s -> 2924.97s]  jedi just delete your computer okay? Because here comes the last jedi reference. Here it
[2924.97s -> 2929.21s]  comes. So you're ready? If you haven't seen the last jedi then mute for the next 30 seconds.
[2933.35s -> 2941.03s]  Good. You good? What does this remind you of? It's the princess Leia like thing right? With
[2941.03s -> 2953.54s]  she flying back. That's the same exact everything. All right you can you're good.
[2953.54s -> 2962.94s]  Unmute now. Read my lips. You can unmute. How is that a spoiler? Because if it that's a
[2963.26s -> 2989.43s]  major plot device there. Unmute. Yeah you're you're good. I already I gave the ultimate
[2989.43s -> 2993.59s]  star wars reference. Well I did. There are two hatches. Hatch two is straight ahead.
[2993.59s -> 3010.34s]  Hatch five leads below. Which way should I go? Hatch five. Hatch five okay. I don't think I
[3010.34s -> 3019.54s]  can go any further. I'm turning back. Oh a heal capsule. Jerma go to hatch three.
[3019.54s -> 3022.50s]  Jerma go to hatch three. Jerma go to hatch three. Jerma go to hatch three.
[3022.50s -> 3026.42s]  Jerma go to hatch three. Jerma go to hatch three. Jerma go to hatch three. Jerma go to hatch three.
[3026.42s -> 3045.83s]  Which way should I go? Recover. Yes. What's the save point? I did I x out of my
[3045.83s -> 3066.10s]  fucking walkthrough. Hatch two. Hatch two okay. The hatch is closed. You have to analyze and
[3066.10s -> 3117.83s]  open it i i hold on oh uh uh uh ugh there's a save point in here
[3117.83s -> 3126.60s]  jerma go to hatch three this is the laboratory go to hatch three
[3126.60s -> 3130.36s]  jerma go to hatch three were they studying how to make the philosopher's
[3130.36s -> 3142.76s]  stone here right save point the save point
[3142.76s -> 3149.77s]  okay it's right in front of us oh i can finally take a sigh of god
[3149.77s -> 3172.82s]  relief ah great canadian fuck club 50 fucking community subs how many
[3172.82s -> 3179.45s]  community subs do you have now are you over like five or six
[3179.45s -> 3190.70s]  fucking hundred fifty oh my god did that
[3190.70s -> 3207.08s]  that's what is with the money the last few days
[3207.08s -> 3214.06s]  it's been i don't i don't i don't have any words that's
[3214.06s -> 3222.97s]  that's a lot of money god all right so we're going to go to
[3224.01s -> 3229.00s]  thank you so much thank you so much for the 50 community subs
[3229.00s -> 3232.60s]  sample cases the sample case run okay quickly
[3232.60s -> 3241.66s]  okay how much money was 50 and 50 community subs
[3241.66s -> 3252.39s]  is is five times 50 uh check glass are you talking about that
[3252.39s -> 3259.16s]  that is check sample case if you don't say which case i can't help you
[3259.24s -> 3264.92s]  check top right sample case this don't open that it's one of those
[3264.92s -> 3269.82s]  monsters don't open that this is evidence of
[3269.82s -> 3277.14s]  illegal experimentation all right don't open that
[3277.14s -> 3280.66s]  experiment rack one experiment rack one
[3280.66s -> 3289.10s]  okay run smash the glass and eat the monster run
[3289.10s -> 3293.66s]  quickly okay these look like test systems
[3293.66s -> 3300.46s]  everything around this pillar fly check control panel
[3300.46s -> 3303.90s]  it's the panel for controlling the robotic arm at least that's what i
[3303.90s -> 3307.80s]  think wiggle it around and try to win the teddy bear
[3307.80s -> 3312.81s]  wiggle ah control panel it's a panel for controlling an experiment
[3312.81s -> 3316.73s]  stop grab control panel it's a panel for
[3316.73s -> 3323.42s]  controlling an experiment rack operate control panel the control
[3323.42s -> 3326.78s]  panel wrecking it is pointless what else
[3326.78s -> 3330.86s]  should i do use control panel using a huge machine
[3330.86s -> 3335.90s]  like this is way out of my league okay it's all you
[3335.90s -> 3346.33s]  it's all oh it's inoperable set to emergency mode storage boots
[3346.33s -> 3361.26s]  the storage boots okay i can't even see any of this shit
[3361.26s -> 3370.84s]  activate do what with what check wall panel what should i check
[3370.84s -> 3379.42s]  ghost busters one ghost containing machine that's all it took let me see
[3379.42s -> 3382.86s]  oh i guess you exchange experiment racks using this
[3382.86s -> 3392.28s]  so the storage and extraction experiment rack okay
[3392.28s -> 3396.04s]  operate experiment rack experiment rack three
[3396.04s -> 3410.14s]  okay run quickly okay it's the same thing
[3410.14s -> 3417.93s]  experiment rack two experiment rack two okay
[3417.93s -> 3433.59s]  run run run slowly oh that's not what i said
[3433.59s -> 3459.66s]  where is my walkthrough look at floating purple object
[3459.66s -> 3464.78s]  okay i'll leave no that's not what i wanted you to do
[3464.78s -> 3473.66s]  walkthrough is cheating not at this point where did you just know leave
[3473.66s -> 3481.85s]  like she's leaving the whole place why are you doing this
[3481.85s -> 3485.37s]  no stop don't go through two different places
[3485.37s -> 3489.45s]  that's hatch three hatch four turn around turn around
[3489.45s -> 3494.49s]  what are you doing stop stop stop stop stop i know you're having a lot of
[3494.49s -> 3497.21s]  fun and zero gravity is really interesting
[3497.21s -> 3502.01s]  but listen stop what you're doing stop floating around
[3502.01s -> 3512.10s]  where are you going hat stop yep hatch tow hatch five
[3512.10s -> 3524.82s]  hatch two hatch two hatch hatch two okay one two three months like four
[3524.82s -> 3544.26s]  hatches this is why how dare you use a walkthrough
[3544.26s -> 3549.74s]  that was at least how many blinks was that i don't know
[3549.74s -> 3554.52s]  just admit that you're bad at the game stop
[3554.52s -> 3558.97s]  yep experiment experiment gum rack two
[3558.97s -> 3575.38s]  experiment rack two okay shoe check shoe huh what are you talking about
[3575.38s -> 3579.08s]  that's a shoe up there there's nothing like that here
[3579.08s -> 3583.59s]  check purple shoe what are you talking about
[3583.59s -> 3588.44s]  look at the shoe there's nothing like that here look above
[3588.44s -> 3596.06s]  to see shoe okay i'll leave no stay stop yep
[3596.06s -> 3599.26s]  experiment rack two experiment rack two
[3599.26s -> 3614.81s]  okay run look above were they using this for animal testing
[3614.81s -> 3618.89s]  look above robot arm is it a tool for experiments
[3618.89s -> 3628.50s]  i don't really know check purple object is it a tool for experiments i don't
[3628.50s -> 3634.82s]  really know look up what should i check
[3634.82s -> 3642.39s]  look up at floating object the save point okay stop
[3642.39s -> 3646.39s]  stop stop stop yep experiment rack two
[3646.39s -> 3662.42s]  experiment rack two run okay quickly okay look top left
[3662.42s -> 3673.19s]  what should i check check top left what should i check check up
[3673.19s -> 3680.09s]  what should i check what the fuck does the walkthrough say
[3680.09s -> 3685.69s]  check up up holy shit you fucking can't be serious
[3685.69s -> 3701.00s]  it's a shoe what is this i told you guys didn't know it was a shoe
[3701.00s -> 3705.80s]  hey can you analyze this for me how am i supposed to analyze a shoe
[3705.80s -> 3721.18s]  leather product past inspection was naomi here
[3721.18s -> 3731.22s]  there's something like a tunnel in the back could she be beyond there
[3731.22s -> 3733.94s]  i can't get in there unless the gap is widened
[3733.94s -> 3748.86s]  what are you doing she's gonna smash your face it's an auto emergent it
[3748.86s -> 3754.26s]  can't be directly operated we need to find another way of
[3754.26s -> 3764.26s]  lowering this device all right storage boots the storage
[3764.26s -> 3780.41s]  boots okay run quickly okay check
[3780.41s -> 3798.62s]  what should i okay check other panel check left panel
[3798.62s -> 3820.70s]  check left panel check input panel check input panel check control
[3820.70s -> 3828.81s]  device experiment rack jettison that's it
[3828.81s -> 3833.18s]  if we get rid of the experiment rack i'll be able to enter that corridor
[3833.62s -> 3838.66s]  so do it yeah it's okay the system appears to operate even in an emergency
[3838.66s -> 3843.06s]  yeah okay let's give it a shot i feel like you're operating the machine to
[3843.06s -> 3850.58s]  scream operate to jettison experiment rack
[3850.58s -> 3854.02s]  into space the operator must enter the disengagement code number within a
[3854.02s -> 3877.66s]  set time frame hello busy mode the experiment rack
[3877.66s -> 3882.14s]  insert the shoe in the machine the shoe was just a big key
[3882.14s -> 3886.39s]  i get it i read some numbers and you enter them
[3886.39s -> 3889.75s]  that's easy and we'll get it done in the jiffy read numbers
[3889.75s -> 3899.58s]  entering release code let's see two one oh no it's
[3899.58s -> 3911.35s]  three one four what the fuck please proceed let's see
[3911.35s -> 3925.94s]  six four and seven seven pound five let's see
[3925.94s -> 3935.06s]  three eight uh seven and five and stop saying and why are you saying
[3935.06s -> 3955.99s]  and three four and seven and two five star you motherfucker
[3955.99s -> 3959.27s]  two five uh star two five four eight five one
[3959.27s -> 3971.69s]  we have to get it together slow why do you have to
[3971.69s -> 3976.30s]  self-destruct initiated sixty six and yep
[3976.30s -> 3989.85s]  six six four 66 and uh six six four get it together
[3989.85s -> 3994.49s]  66 and uh yep uh six it's like four numbers
[3994.49s -> 3998.73s]  you don't have to stop in the middle you just say the numbers
[3998.73s -> 4002.17s]  you look at it if it's six six six four
[4002.17s -> 4005.61s]  you don't have to go six uh yep uh six
[4005.61s -> 4011.56s]  six um and four have you ever read a sequence of numbers before in your
[4011.56s -> 4020.10s]  entire life two uh and uh uh three four two five uh
[4020.10s -> 4033.72s]  star and uh and that's it can i just have to start
[4033.72s -> 4036.92s]  can i just fucking get it together activate this and like put her into
[4036.92s -> 4049.61s]  space let's see seven two and
[4049.61s -> 4063.46s]  it's seven one eight five release code please try again
[4063.46s -> 4090.12s]  get it together how am i supposed to know
[4090.12s -> 4098.23s]  if you say it wrong first seven two no seven uh one but you're just
[4098.23s -> 4118.14s]  reading a sequence of numbers see nine five and one that's it
[4118.14s -> 4128.46s]  see three eight uh seven
[4131.14s -> 4138.66s]  let's see pound star five star and nine pounds what was it

[5000.60s -> 5008.84s]  he'll surely die i'm the one who locked him in the monitor room
[5008.92s -> 5024.09s]  well it's too late to save so it was you who altered the station's orbit
[5024.09s -> 5032.47s]  that's correct rio howner still find it puzzling
[5032.47s -> 5046.30s]  i was certain i'd shot you in the what what just happened

[8209.80s -> 8214.22s]  is it them or was it enough was it somebody else
[8214.22s -> 8221.59s]  entirely different because obviously it's not you

[8271.08s -> 8274.60s]  that for fucking like 16 straight hours almost
[8274.60s -> 8277.16s]  worst thing i've ever done in my life worst thing i've ever done in my adult
[8277.16s -> 8282.28s]  life and it was a very fun experience very
[8282.28s -> 8285.88s]  good game now all jokes aside it was really cool
[8285.88s -> 8289.00s]  really fun uh except for the poor portions with it you didn't really
[8289.00s -> 8291.56s]  listen to you and how broken sometimes it was and
[8291.56s -> 8295.53s]  the unskippable cutscenes i'm not gonna give it a letter grade
[8295.53s -> 8298.57s]  but i'm gonna tell you right now if you have a playstation 2
[8298.57s -> 8301.85s]  make sure you have the one or two specific headsets that will even work
[8301.85s -> 8306.65s]  with the game because you can't just plug in anything
[8306.65s -> 8312.17s]  it has to be a very specific headset who's gonna buy this
[8312.17s -> 8323.08s]  i'm acting like this is a game that's on steam right now you can't just go
[8323.08s -> 8330.04s]  get this that was a fun experience that was a
[8330.04s -> 8332.36s]  good that was a fun no no no hold on let's rephrase that that was a
[8332.36s -> 8339.50s]  good stream that was a fun super stream was it 12 13 14
[8339.50s -> 8343.42s]  about like 15 hours or so in the last 24 hours
[8343.42s -> 8351.34s]  that look at like sometimes we play these fucked up weird games
[8351.34s -> 8363.30s]  this stream doesn't happen unless this game exists it was great
[8363.30s -> 8371.77s]  so um the purpose of today's stream last night because we went so late
[8371.77s -> 8377.32s]  into the morning if you weren't around yesterday i
[8377.32s -> 8381.75s]  streamed until like three or four a.m pacific
[8381.75s -> 8386.49s]  so i didn't get a whole lot of sleep and obviously i wanted to get up
[8386.49s -> 8391.50s]  and do the irl stream so what we're gonna do and i
[8391.50s -> 8393.50s]  want to finish this game obviously too because
[8393.50s -> 8399.35s]  i just kept it going from yesterday or this this morning
[8399.35s -> 8409.45s]  end of the stream yeah so last night there was a ton of bits
[8409.45s -> 8412.89s]  and there was a lot of messages and i didn't do any of them because the
[8412.89s -> 8416.73s]  stream was so late into the morning that what we're gonna do right now
[8416.73s -> 8420.49s]  we're gonna just kind of relax we're gonna
[8420.57s -> 8426.09s]  just hang out gonna go over the bits from yesterday
[8426.09s -> 8429.29s]  and do the obviously the bits from today
[8429.29s -> 8441.86s]  and just chill for a little while and then the stream will end
[8441.86s -> 8450.30s]  and on top of that the next time you'll see me what's today today is
[8450.30s -> 8456.44s]  today's the 23rd wednesday you will see me again
[8456.44s -> 8460.36s]  on friday and saturday and friday and saturday
[8460.36s -> 8465.34s]  we have a lot of random things we can do there's tons of shit to do
[8465.34s -> 8475.32s]  that could be finally the day of dreamcast because i have all the games
[8475.32s -> 8479.56s]  i have all the stuff or maybe i don't know it really depends
[8479.56s -> 8483.74s]  on what i feel like doing so you'll see me again on friday if

[8534.25s -> 8537.45s]  kind of all over the place with streams i missed i pushed a stream
[8537.45s -> 8540.66s]  back because i wasn't feeling that great last week so
[8540.66s -> 8544.44s]  i don't see why i wouldn't be able to do it unless something else comes
[8544.44s -> 8557.96s]  up which i don't think it will open the safe there's an easter egg
[8557.96s -> 8562.04s]  so let's go through the bits from today actually no no no no no no

[8993.14s -> 8995.62s]  because i'm fresh out of college and i'm stuck working the graveyard at a

[9028.14s -> 9031.58s]  were tears streaming down my cheeks from the barrage of insults
[9031.58s -> 9034.78s]  and it felt worse when i heard the laughing and another man in the car
[9034.78s -> 9039.26s]  as well as a synthesized noise coming from some sort of instrument
[9039.34s -> 9045.13s]  i couldn't handle it anymore in my current state being i just got it a

[9072.82s -> 9076.34s]  as a response to this i heard boy boisterous laughter coming from the
[9076.34s -> 9078.82s]  two men and the sounds of my manager coming down
[9078.82s -> 9081.94s]  the hall to talk to me he shoved me and took my headset
[9082.02s -> 9085.30s]  and told me to go to the second window and get ready to give them their order
[9085.30s -> 9089.14s]  i apologized for him may i take your order after a minute or two
[9089.14s -> 9093.78s]  and an order appeared on the screen two small coffees
[9093.78s -> 9098.82s]  two ten piece chicken wings four limited edition cheeto sauces
[9098.82s -> 9102.18s]  i prepared their order and waited in the window and looked down through the
[9102.18s -> 9106.54s]  the drive to take a look at their car what i saw was a car smaller than
[9106.54s -> 9110.30s]  a volkswagen beetle painted white with red blue green and yellow
[9110.38s -> 9114.86s]  spots all over it in the words german 985 emblazoned in fluorescent purple
[9114.86s -> 9118.30s]  across the hood swerving down the road hitting the
[9118.30s -> 9128.25s]  wall multiple times in a 10-foot journey to the window
[9128.25s -> 9136.10s]  how long is this this is like a whole story the one driving
[9136.10s -> 9141.34s]  appeared to be an older man and was flushed red

[9178.09s -> 9181.13s]  was that a good one cheeto a real lol moment huh
[9181.13s -> 9184.97s]  and the automaton played some high notes seemingly meant to signify a
[9184.97s -> 9187.37s]  chortle he finally actually looked at me and
[9187.37s -> 9190.17s]  saw my distraught state and shrieked with laughter
[9190.17s -> 9193.69s]  at this point i couldn't look at them and i turned away sobbing holding
[9193.69s -> 9196.33s]  out the drink tray with their coffee and the brown paper sack
[9196.33s -> 9198.41s]  containing their cheetos and chicken
[9198.41s -> 9201.69s]  the older looking man had to jump out of his seat to grab and snatch the goods
[9201.69s -> 9206.01s]  from my tear stained hands i was still for a i was still for a
[9206.01s -> 9208.41s]  while until i heard their car finally drive off
[9208.41s -> 9211.93s]  and when i finally looked forward once more i could make out a small
[9211.93s -> 9214.49s]  card left on the counter in front of me
[9214.49s -> 9218.49s]  through my tear clouded vision i took the slip of paper and
[9218.49s -> 9221.93s]  locked myself in the bathroom to cry and about an hour the emotion had
[9221.93s -> 9223.77s]  passed and my sight was clear again so i

[10072.07s -> 10075.40s]  shit you guys say half the shit you do it's like
[10075.40s -> 10078.36s]  there's a lot of fucking talented fun interesting people here that could

[10118.82s -> 10122.86s]  that uh you don't have to spend 1500
[10122.86s -> 10129.10s]  dollars to get a gaming pc a gaming pc does not have to cost that
[10129.10s -> 10134.09s]  much fun you could get something that's very

[10156.62s -> 10163.21s]  to play games you can probably get a decent gaming computer for like
[10163.21s -> 10166.49s]  somewhere in between like five to seven hundred bucks
[10166.49s -> 10170.62s]  you could you could do it somewhere under a thousand i think is you could
[10170.62s -> 10175.64s]  actually absolutely make it happen and don't buy expensive shit just
[10175.64s -> 10179.96s]  because it's expensive some of the stuff that you can buy is
[10179.96s -> 10182.76s]  oh yeah but it's 10 faster than the
[10182.76s -> 10186.04s]  than the latest and greatest and it's two grand you don't that doesn't

[10204.04s -> 10208.20s]  heavy editing heavy photo manipulation heavy video manipulation then of course
[10208.20s -> 10212.44s]  you need a computer that can do it but if you're just playing pc games
[10212.44s -> 10216.07s]  and you don't care about playing at the
[10216.07s -> 10220.57s]  ultra ultra ultra settings and you don't care about being on like just

[11082.50s -> 11087.30s]  green screen stream a yearly stream it was an amazing stream probably not
[11087.30s -> 11093.03s]  i probably would want to do it once or twice not that much
[11093.03s -> 11097.22s]  because i feel like it loses its magic if you do it too many times
[11097.22s -> 11100.14s]  that's why a lot of people say oh why don't you do a do a germa rumble
[11100.14s -> 11104.12s]  event like every once a month or something
[11104.12s -> 11108.23s]  loses its flavor and it gives enough time to have
[11108.23s -> 11111.75s]  obviously more characters and more stuff and more references it's it's
[11111.75s -> 11115.35s]  better to space it out much further but
[11115.35s -> 11117.67s]  once a year i would really have to get in front
[11117.67s -> 11122.74s]  of the camera more than once because i'm not going to just put up
[11122.74s -> 11126.58s]  the same footage where hey yeah remember that footage i recorded

[11219.50s -> 11226.52s]  politicals uh should aside i have a lot of beliefs that are from all
[11226.52s -> 11229.08s]  over the political spectrum we don't talk about them because i
[11229.08s -> 11232.12s]  don't i don't want this to be a politics stream
[11232.12s -> 11235.56s]  there's no i don't think there's a reason to do it because i i'd like to
[11235.56s -> 11242.23s]  keep this stream and this community kind of away from
[11242.23s -> 11257.56s]  all that not good enough oh he's such a he's such a
[11257.56s -> 11266.15s]  neutral no yeah we you can read between the lines here over the last few years
[11266.15s -> 11273.26s]  i have a lot of i think a lot of people are dynamic
[11273.26s -> 11283.40s]  radical centrist no you're not allowed to like everyone there's nothing to do
[11283.40s -> 11288.50s]  with liking everyone and everybody has their own opinions
[11288.50s -> 11291.70s]  and i don't need to share them i don't have to talk about them
[11291.70s -> 11296.44s]  i don't feel like i have very many extreme positions on very much
[11296.44s -> 11318.81s]  stream and it's slow mode please politics are polarizing
[11318.81s -> 11322.98s]  and that's why i don't talk about them because
[11322.98s -> 11329.51s]  that's not what this community is for it's not what this community is about
[11329.51s -> 11332.95s]  it's about us hanging out getting together and not
[11332.95s -> 11336.95s]  worrying about that shit for a little while world's a crazy fucking
[11336.95s -> 11344.57s]  place world is a crazy fucking place but
[11344.57s -> 11348.49s]  i'd rather us just be able to hang out and
[11348.49s -> 11358.71s]  have a good time so people that say what's your opinion on this what's
[11358.71s -> 11360.79s]  your opinion on that how do you feel about that say this say that how
[11360.79s -> 11365.99s]  do you feel about that it's like it's tough because i don't want i don't
[11365.99s -> 11370.55s]  want a bunch of people to you know using certain things that i
[11370.55s -> 11373.75s]  say as examples to not want to listen to what i have to say not

[11376.55s -> 11380.47s]  my streams oh now fuck that guy he said that fuck him
[11380.47s -> 11401.74s]  i'd rather just remove it entirely at least in this space
[11401.74s -> 11404.06s]  if you wanted to have a private conversation with me about something
[11404.06s -> 11407.58s]  like that you know so be it right like i've had
[11407.58s -> 11412.15s]  private conversations before with some people in this community about
[11412.15s -> 11416.39s]  you know political stuff before but not in like a form like this
[11416.39s -> 11424.86s]  which is why that jokey but also very serious
[11424.86s -> 11428.46s]  uh i don't we don't talk about politics on the stream is still there
[11428.46s -> 11434.66s]  i feel like people are trying to bait germa into talking politics so they
[11434.66s -> 11440.54s]  can meme about it at his expense no i don't i don't think so i think
[11440.54s -> 11452.38s]  everything's just fine and even if they are then that's
[11452.38s -> 11458.94s]  okay it doesn't because i i'm not i'm not going to give
[11458.94s -> 11462.38s]  i'm not going to give any there's not going to be a stream where i sit up
[11462.38s -> 11465.58s]  here and i talk about let me tell you this and let me tell you
[11465.58s -> 11474.70s]  that because that's not how i am anyways what is the camera resolution
[11474.70s -> 11484.44s]  very bad i've never gotten the vibe that the chat is malicious and it's
[11484.44s -> 11498.78s]  trolling no i don't think so either but to close the book on that we
[11498.78s -> 11507.58s]  don't even need to open it at least here uh resident evil 2 on

[12812.01s -> 12814.89s]  this game's plot is so asinine is because they never expected anyone to
[12814.89s -> 12823.26s]  get this far maybe possible but thank you for the
[12823.26s -> 12826.31s]  one dollar thank you dork cube for the one dollar

[12897.42s -> 12906.94s]  return to the heavens and make his final judgment on humanity

[12919.56s -> 12925.91s]  you guys if it doesn't happen to you guys i'm sure it does
[12925.91s -> 12929.59s]  when i like sit on a computer screen and more than like two or three
[12929.59s -> 12932.95s]  hours go by i feel like like my i like my eyes
[12932.95s -> 12938.87s]  start to water and even when i take break and i you know throw some
[12938.95s -> 12941.19s]  water on my face and just hang out it's like
[12941.19s -> 12944.55s]  it's annoying i need to get like gamer goggles
[12944.55s -> 12954.62s]  you might need to turn down your brightness i think it's actually pretty
[12954.62s -> 12958.31s]  low it's like on the 30 to 40 percent side it's not
[12958.31s -> 12962.07s]  that high i don't think maybe i'll try that i'll get gamer goggles and i'll
[12962.07s -> 12964.71s]  turn the brightness down like another 10 percent and see if that helps
[12964.71s -> 12968.95s]  because sometimes it's just like i have really sensitive eyes though
[12968.95s -> 12973.32s]  anyways if i go outside in the wind for even five seconds but there's a
[12973.32s -> 12976.70s]  little breeze of wind and it hits my face
[12976.70s -> 12981.26s]  what tears just stream down my cheeks it looks bad it looks like i'm just
[12981.26s -> 12988.20s]  crying streaming down my face i walk into like a like a coffee
[12988.20s -> 12991.62s]  shop or something out of the wind and it's like
[12991.62s -> 12995.30s]  can i get a latte and they're just like holy shit okay

[13041.83s -> 13045.19s]  as much as you enjoyed that stream which is arguably
[13045.19s -> 13047.83s]  one of my favorite times sitting in this chair
[13047.83s -> 13053.05s]  the sims 4 mod streams especially the first one was probably the
[13053.05s -> 13056.49s]  the most fun i've ever had sitting in a chair with a game
[13056.49s -> 13061.78s]  probably talking about tears streaming down my face that
[13061.78s -> 13067.67s]  happened that actually happened during that stream
[13067.67s -> 13071.35s]  i will never be able to replicate or replace how fun that stream was
[13071.35s -> 13075.19s]  but you can do other things we got a lot of other plans so don't worry
[13075.19s -> 13079.72s]  don't worry but thanks for the one dollar thank you dork cube for the
[13079.72s -> 13084.76s]  one dollar my frigid heart the only thing that melts it is your labo

[13164.65s -> 13167.53s]  one dollar hey germ just want to say congrats on not dying today
[13167.53s -> 13171.29s]  the new semester started this week and i would not last till finals
[13171.29s -> 13174.33s]  finals without your wacky epic gameplay commentary

[13178.95s -> 13183.83s]  i will and good luck on the new semester
[13183.83s -> 13192.65s]  thank you good luck much love to you wow epic gamer
[13192.65s -> 13195.53s]  what that's what's wrong with epic gamer
[13195.53s -> 13200.86s]  i'll take the title of epic gamer that's fine
[13200.86s -> 13204.78s]  i can't wear germa shirts what if i'm associated what
[13204.78s -> 13209.90s]  what if you do crimes if you commit a crime with my t-shirt on they're
[13209.90s -> 13212.38s]  not going to think that i committed the crime too
[13212.38s -> 13218.02s]  it's like there he is he robbed a bank and he's wearing a metallica shirt
[13218.02s -> 13222.22s]  go arrest metallica too they must have had something to do with this
[13222.22s -> 13239.56s]  he told don't stop that stop it uh thank you soys awc for the three
[13239.56s -> 13241.98s]  bucks hey germa you're a genius when it
[13241.98s -> 13244.86s]  comes to entertaining me i want you to be part of a major
[13244.86s -> 13248.97s]  decision in my life okay and i want to quit this job
[13248.97s -> 13251.21s]  because i'm not respected for my hard work
[13251.29s -> 13256.42s]  input and input because i refuse to twiddle my thumbs just to clock in hours
[13256.42s -> 13264.34s]  i'm carrying this project but we're probably getting none of the credit
[13264.34s -> 13269.98s]  well want me to be a part of a major decision what's the decision
[13269.98s -> 13281.19s]  to stop working on the project or quitting or leaving or should you stay
[13281.19s -> 13287.80s]  or should you leave um there's a there's a couple of
[13287.80s -> 13294.63s]  scenarios i'm not a professional when it comes to stuff like this but
[13294.63s -> 13298.71s]  i would say if you're not happy what you're doing and you're putting in a
[13298.71s -> 13301.99s]  lot of work and you're not getting what you think
[13301.99s -> 13304.31s]  out what you should be getting out of it
[13304.31s -> 13307.51s]  then you need to start kind of looking for something else something
[13307.51s -> 13309.91s]  maybe try looking for another job try looking for another place in the
[13309.91s -> 13316.89s]  same field and if you're able to you know get
[13316.89s -> 13320.41s]  a job and leave the one you're currently at now that's way easier said
[13320.41s -> 13324.54s]  than done i know that and i understand that
[13324.54s -> 13328.46s]  but you don't want to put yourself into a position where you
[13328.46s -> 13332.62s]  are going to essentially regret what you did you know if you quit your job today
[13332.62s -> 13336.30s]  and you're like fuck this place i'm out of here and then i'm going to
[13336.30s -> 13339.18s]  go look for something if you can't find something then you
[13339.18s -> 13342.22s]  don't you got to be careful are you financially able to do that maybe you
[13342.22s -> 13344.94s]  are if you are financially able to do that
[13344.94s -> 13347.66s]  maybe that is something that you want to do it really depends on your
[13347.66s -> 13353.32s]  specific scenario but unless you have a lot of money
[13353.32s -> 13358.95s]  i don't think that's a great idea personally i would say the route of
[13358.95s -> 13362.23s]  looking for to interview other places and looking to find other stuff to do
[13362.23s -> 13366.23s]  while you're still working and then once you know that you've got a
[13366.23s -> 13370.07s]  solid lead and you're going to be able to work somewhere else
[13370.07s -> 13374.42s]  maybe go through on that route instead it's
[13374.42s -> 13378.57s]  it's rough there's no real correct answer here i don't think
[13378.57s -> 13382.09s]  because everybody's so different and everybody has such wildly different
[13382.09s -> 13385.85s]  lives and jobs and i don't know how essentially you
[13385.85s -> 13389.21s]  are as an employee to this project and if you leave are you
[13389.21s -> 13392.73s]  negatively affecting other people i don't know i don't know that's for you to
[13392.73s -> 13402.70s]  decide but the safest route is is definitely
[13402.70s -> 13408.18s]  to try to find something else that's great don't jump from the
[13408.18s -> 13410.98s]  plane without a parachute that is a great point yes that is pretty much
[13410.98s -> 13421.62s]  exactly what we're talking about that's just my opinion and that's just
[13421.62s -> 13426.98s]  the way that i see things other people might see it differently but
[13426.98s -> 13432.63s]  got to think about the future you do but i wish you the best of luck
[13432.63s -> 13435.51s]  sorry to hear about the hardships at work hopefully you get it figured out
[13435.51s -> 13441.11s]  real soon thank you uh soy's awc did my eyes just
[13441.11s -> 13447.67s]  change color no i don't think so i think they're only

[14820.62s -> 14824.46s]  lately lately i feel like i don't really have a purpose
[14824.46s -> 14827.66s]  in life other than just to live and be there for other people either that or
[14827.66s -> 14830.30s]  i'm just living for dreams and opportunities that i
[14830.30s -> 14833.18s]  know are never going to happen but i keep giving it a chance as an
[14833.18s -> 14835.90s]  excuse to live longer it's just so many
[14835.90s -> 14838.62s]  expectations and pressure from other people and i don't know what to do
[14838.62s -> 14841.18s]  with my own life and that's on top of depression so
[14841.18s -> 14846.22s]  much other shit and that says one out of two i will
[14846.22s -> 14851.24s]  tell you very very very much i mentioned uh lobster five community
[14851.24s -> 14855.00s]  subs thank you i mentioned something uh not even five
[14855.00s -> 14857.88s]  ten minutes ago about if 18 year old me could look into the
[14857.88s -> 14861.88s]  future they would think it was a lie um the
[14861.88s -> 14866.42s]  thing about opportunity is you never you never know when it's
[14866.42s -> 14868.82s]  going to happen the reason why it is why it is called
[14868.82s -> 14872.12s]  opportunity is because it could just fucking happen and
[14872.12s -> 14876.14s]  you'll never know you just you just try to be ready for it
[14876.14s -> 14879.74s]  it doesn't matter if you're talking about something in work or relationship
[14879.74s -> 14884.28s]  or school there's there's no real way to
[14884.28s -> 14889.40s]  to prepare for it i was not prepared for it i was not ready for it
[14889.40s -> 14894.73s]  i was just like a lot of you fucking guys
[14894.73s -> 14899.54s]  all of you guys when i was like 18 19 20 i'd you know you just kind of
[14899.54s -> 14902.18s]  you're just doing you you're trying to figure out what you want to do
[14902.18s -> 14904.74s]  into your 20s into your 30s you're just trying to figure out what the
[14904.74s -> 14911.67s]  fuck you want to do and sometimes an opportunity will knock
[14911.67s -> 14914.39s]  and you just happen to do it and you can't really foresee that it's going
[14914.39s -> 14919.32s]  to happen but on top of that though there there
[14919.32s -> 14923.42s]  is no secret formula i i think people will ask well how
[14923.42s -> 14925.98s]  do you do this how do you do that what's the secret what's the what
[14925.98s -> 14930.66s]  there really is no secret it's just kind of uh
[14930.66s -> 14936.42s]  passion a little a little bit of uh talent in the right areas a lot of
[14936.42s -> 14938.82s]  luck you know that's what opportunity really
[14938.82s -> 14944.18s]  kind of is is those a handful of things and
[14944.18s -> 14949.19s]  i really wish there was a way for me to
[14949.19s -> 14952.15s]  tell you all the secrets and give you all these things and hey let me
[14952.15s -> 14954.39s]  tell you this this is the exact thing you have to do
[14954.39s -> 14962.30s]  with your life but i can't do that you know i can't uh i i can't give
[14962.30s -> 14965.85s]  you the answers because i don't have them
[14965.85s -> 14973.46s]  as much as uh yeah life is very complex
[14973.46s -> 14981.69s]  but to put a cap on something like that try to find a few things that you
[14981.69s -> 14984.81s]  like to do a few things that you're good at
[14984.81s -> 14990.70s]  and just make your life however you can from those handful of
[14990.70s -> 14993.96s]  things everybody's good at something everybody's
[14993.96s -> 14997.16s]  good at fucking something you just might not know what it is
[14997.16s -> 15012.74s]  yet and even if you do work on it all the time a lot of
[15012.74s -> 15014.82s]  people say i'm not good at anything
[15014.82s -> 15018.50s]  you yes you are there's at least a handful of things that you could
[15018.50s -> 15024.15s]  reliably do that you know that you can and if you don't if you really don't
[15024.15s -> 15029.53s]  think you do you might try to take up some more
[15029.53s -> 15032.41s]  hobbies try to take up some more things that you might want to try to
[15032.41s -> 15045.19s]  get better at i wish i had the secrets everybody's good at something

[17226.14s -> 17230.70s]  maybe um sub only mode is as is like a way
[17230.70s -> 17234.54s]  to potentially help or corral when

[17567.05s -> 17570.57s]  dollar this is chump change right here don't say that but what you don't know
[17570.57s -> 17573.45s]  is i'm almost at a hundred dollars donated you see i didn't give it all
[17573.45s -> 17575.77s]  at once i've broken it down into a ton of
[17575.77s -> 17584.50s]  messages germa iq yeah i mean no one's expected to
[17584.50s -> 17589.18s]  fucking just give that much money in that short amount of time
[17590.39s -> 17597.42s]  tons of you guys have given like ten five dollars dollar two dollars
[17597.42s -> 17602.31s]  every single stream it adds up a lot it adds up over time to a point where
[17602.31s -> 17605.19s]  you you have given potentially hundreds of
[17605.19s -> 17618.39s]  dollars over the years bottom left what's in the bottom
[17618.39s -> 17625.61s]  left pillow with duct tape on it yeah if
[17625.61s -> 17627.37s]  you're just if you're just joining us we
[17627.37s -> 17632.71s]  i finished um lifeline and there were a lot of messages and a lot of bits
[17632.71s -> 17636.23s]  and stuff that i didn't read from yesterday and i'm just kind of
[17636.23s -> 17639.99s]  going through the massive amount of bits and
[17639.99s -> 17643.59s]  subs and donations that were given over the last 48 hours so
[17643.59s -> 17648.10s]  we're just kind of hanging up for a while just chilling up what chat am i
[17648.10s -> 17658.46s]  reading from the what are we talking about hangout
[17658.46s -> 17662.46s]  stream i too like to hang out with my friends by watching us shower money
[17662.46s -> 17668.17s]  on one lucky friend for five hours straight
[17668.17s -> 17677.10s]  well two because we i beat i beat the lifeline i beat lifeline at about three
[17677.10s -> 17686.57s]  and a half to four hours in sounds like my kind of party my three
[17686.57s -> 17690.94s]  thousand friends watching watching us give one person
[17690.94s -> 17697.61s]  money um but this doesn't happen that often
[17697.61s -> 17701.29s]  this is this is an anomaly for sure this is a lot of fucking money
[17701.29s -> 17703.85s]  and a lot of messages over the last couple of days this
[17703.85s -> 17706.87s]  does not happen all the time so i obviously want to give the
[17706.87s -> 17714.42s]  attention that i think it deserves but we'll we are getting we're getting
[17714.42s -> 17718.66s]  there not very much left not like a it's probably not going to
[17718.66s -> 17723.32s]  take more than an hour or so but this is also another conversation
[17723.32s -> 17729.50s]  to have because a part of me does not want to
[17729.50s -> 17735.83s]  have this conversation but kind of have to at some point
[17735.83s -> 17740.22s]  if remember how when we it used to be
[17740.22s -> 17743.74s]  it was 25 cents and i would read everything
[17743.74s -> 17748.14s]  right and then we move that to a dollar and i'm still trying to read as much as
[17748.14s -> 17753.35s]  i can what happens is when there's so many
[17753.35s -> 17756.71s]  people giving money and so many people
[17756.71s -> 17762.63s]  donating and it becomes it becomes hard to do this
[17762.63s -> 17768.58s]  with a channel that is growing at the size that we are
[17768.58s -> 17772.44s]  so with a one dollar minimum it actually
[17772.44s -> 17775.72s]  as much as i don't want to say this and i'm not really i'm not sure
[17775.80s -> 17783.43s]  ready to do it yet the threshold may have to increase
[17783.43s -> 17788.52s]  it might have to for the end of the streams
[17788.52s -> 17794.14s]  50 dollar minimum what the hell are you talking about no way
[17794.14s -> 17797.59s]  i wanted to wait as long as i could i wanted to see how
[17797.59s -> 17807.06s]  how far it could go but when there's when there's this many people it just
[17807.06s -> 17812.04s]  it becomes nearly impossible you know sometimes the end of the
[17812.04s -> 17814.84s]  streams will be two three plus potentially hours long
[17814.84s -> 17821.93s]  and that's why we moved it in the first place
[17821.93s -> 17829.62s]  10 to 15 dollars no no it wouldn't be that high
[17829.62s -> 17838.34s]  it would it would not be more than that not no not in a million years
[17838.34s -> 17842.46s]  but it just that's just kind of what happens when
[17842.46s -> 17846.62s]  there's this much to read and i want to give everybody the attention that
[17846.62s -> 17851.37s]  they deserve but the stream needs to function too
[17851.37s -> 17854.49s]  that's been one of my biggest philosophies with doing streaming and
[17854.49s -> 17860.39s]  twitch and everything is having a stream that is a stream
[17860.39s -> 17865.18s]  and that's why i stopped reading stuff in the middle of the streams that's why
[17865.18s -> 17867.90s]  i moved it to the end so we could kind of have a little session where we hang
[17867.90s -> 17872.42s]  out and i'm gonna think about what it would
[17872.42s -> 17878.36s]  possibly be i need to buy the season pass no it's
[17878.36s -> 17881.48s]  just for um end of the stream messages to make
[17881.48s -> 17884.84s]  it easier for us to read them so it doesn't potentially go on for hours at
[17884.84s -> 17893.93s]  a time like that fucking sound but for the
[17893.93s -> 17904.12s]  purposes of uh this stream the one guy vip dlc
[17904.12s -> 17913.48s]  no let's keep going just figured i would bring it up
[17913.48s -> 17917.19s]  and sort of keeping that in here for a while
[17917.19s -> 17919.35s]  because i didn't want to really talk about it because i didn't want to bring
[17919.35s -> 17925.21s]  it up because i didn't want to do it but sometimes it's necessary as much as
[17925.21s -> 17929.83s]  it pains me to say but thank you kill ganon uh for the
[17929.83s -> 17932.71s]  one dollar we we want to thank you for all your hard work oh that's just
[17932.71s -> 17939.83s]  the fucking cheers to you guy we got that already uh dr epic frag

[18678.78s -> 18682.68s]  and then we do this then yeah but this stream really has been
[18682.68s -> 18688.28s]  a majority of this so you know if i stream for six or seven hours
[18688.28s -> 18690.04s]  straight and then there's like an hour or two of this then that's
[18690.04s -> 18696.46s]  that's a little different he slapped him why is there a spike

[18718.86s -> 18722.30s]  kind of lost a sense of direction uh sometimes there are so many choices
[18722.30s -> 18724.06s]  as to what you can do it's impossible
[18724.06s -> 18728.86s]  you just have to pick one and just go and see what happens
[18728.86s -> 18736.12s]  that's a great way to put it sometimes just pick one and just go
[18736.12s -> 18741.94s]  yeah we're just humans we're just a couple of humans
[18741.94s -> 18746.50s]  you don't get that much time right you've got this time

[18778.46s -> 18781.26s]  hospitalized for depression and anxiety and the somewhat routine of your
[18781.26s -> 18783.58s]  streams has actually really helped me over the past year
[18783.58s -> 18786.54s]  currently attending attending a therapeutic school now but your
[18786.54s -> 18789.78s]  streams help me forget i'm in a literal

[18888.06s -> 18891.82s]  how well germa has aged as a comedian back in your tf2 days you
[18891.82s -> 18895.18s]  demonstrated that you had what it took to be an internet personality
[18895.18s -> 18898.14s]  and those who recognized it stuck with you and now in a platform that has
[18898.14s -> 18901.98s]  so many possibilities for entertainer you've delivered every single bit
[18901.98s -> 18905.58s]  back to us tenfold in the form of the finest red blend comedy
[18905.66s -> 18910.06s]  i've ever seen you deserve every dollar coming your way here's to you kid
[18910.06s -> 18925.70s]  i'm glad you think it's funny because if you didn't
[18925.70s -> 18930.66s]  i don't know i'm not sure i would be doing it for as long as i have
[18930.66s -> 18941.51s]  you know i'm i'm glad that people fucking think this is fun
[18941.51s -> 18944.71s]  i had this like certain idea when i was younger and
[18944.71s -> 18947.19s]  you know years a couple years ago three years ago of like what i want to
[18947.19s -> 18949.11s]  do how do i want to make this happen
[18949.11s -> 18952.39s]  how do i want to continue to move because it wasn't kind of a different
[18952.47s -> 18956.79s]  thing right like i went from doing team fortress gameplay commentaries
[18956.79s -> 18960.63s]  about like the spy knife to i want to do other stuff like this
[18960.63s -> 18963.43s]  is it worth doing will i alienate some people if i say something
[18963.43s -> 18969.56s]  fucking like this i don't know but i'm i'm glad that
[18969.56s -> 18974.82s]  people think it's fun i think a lot of people go through
[18974.82s -> 18978.58s]  that though if you do any type type of doesn't matter what you
[18978.58s -> 18982.66s]  do if you're doing something that uses some type of mental energy and
[18982.66s -> 18984.74s]  you start to change the way that you do things or
[18984.74s -> 18991.77s]  pivot to something else you almost kind of worry about if it was the right call
[18991.77s -> 18995.82s]  but i'm glad that people like think it's funny
[18995.82s -> 19002.62s]  thank you for the 50 dollars to shiro and the incredible amount of support
[19002.62s -> 19007.58s]  thank you spicy cues thanks for the one dollar
[19007.58s -> 19010.94s]  dub skew dude thanks for the one dollar i'm currently one dollar in debt
[19010.94s -> 19013.98s]  and may have to file for bankruptcy because of it i'm giving you this
[19013.98s -> 19017.02s]  dollar to you instead hope you feel awful because you did
[19017.10s -> 19024.54s]  this hey novi 333 thanks for the three dollars and 33 cents
[19024.54s -> 19026.94s]  hey germa given how generous this community is do you think we could
[19026.94s -> 19029.58s]  have a charity night i think we could raise some serious
[19029.58s -> 19035.10s]  money to help people in need yeah i've i've thought about charity
[19035.10s -> 19038.70s]  nights before and how to run them and how to make them
[19038.70s -> 19044.57s]  work i think of uh years ago the once a year you know the tip of
[19044.57s -> 19049.45s]  the hats was always something that i wanted to be a part of uh but
[19049.45s -> 19056.95s]  probably that is a nice idea yeah i would want to have that logistically
[19056.95s -> 19061.91s]  make sense right because uh pretty much like i said
[19061.91s -> 19065.35s]  once a year or so i would be part of somebody else's
[19065.35s -> 19069.27s]  stream or somebody else's event or charity event and i would kind of go
[19069.27s -> 19075.86s]  and or do or show up and promote and um but not nothing just like
[19075.86s -> 19078.90s]  personally for me in this stream in this community it's always been
[19078.98s -> 19085.37s]  something else or somebody else's uh event but i'll do some research on that
[19085.37s -> 19092.49s]  figure what i'd want to do and take a lot of time to research
[19092.49s -> 19094.89s]  charities though a lot of actually kind of shady
[19094.89s -> 19099.05s]  yeah that's another thing too is it's hard i i'm not the greatest on
[19099.05s -> 19101.69s]  trying to pick stuff out like that that's why i've always
[19101.69s -> 19105.13s]  felt more comfortable supporting ones that people have already done the
[19105.13s -> 19111.40s]  research on so and maybe it would be another
[19111.40s -> 19114.04s]  thing where i would just support another one and be on another
[19114.04s -> 19117.48s]  event stream or do something like that rather than my own
[19117.48s -> 19126.28s]  but i do agree how um how just how generous this community is
[19126.28s -> 19134.52s]  it's very very very generous but something to think about for sure
[19134.52s -> 19137.16s]  let's move on to thin rue for one dollar hey jerma i used to think i
[19137.16s -> 19139.80s]  was useless but then i found out i can draw

[20634.04s -> 20637.80s]  i think more important to me at this point but i still think it's a great
[20637.80s -> 20641.54s]  craft i still love it but not anymore i don't think not

[20776.66s -> 20779.70s]  bit donation i felt awful about it so i will spend more money
[20779.70s -> 20784.60s]  but i'm an old tf2 fan and was a fan ever since is there a way to
[20784.60s -> 20788.36s]  private message you if not i understand it just really wanted to know

[20790.84s -> 20793.16s]  money for bit donations i'm sorry about that don't
[20793.16s -> 20796.76s]  don't apologize for giving me money but
[20796.76s -> 20800.44s]  i don't do private message i don't have dms open or anything like that i
[20800.44s -> 20804.28s]  don't because it can get overwhelming it can
[20804.28s -> 20809.32s]  get very overwhelming and instead of focusing on this stream
[20809.32s -> 20813.61s]  and this collective gathering of stuff to do
[20813.61s -> 20821.48s]  it's i don't i i don't read i can't it's it's it's it's too much and then
[20821.48s -> 20824.36s]  if you know let's say a bunch of people want to talk to me or ask me
[20824.36s -> 20827.40s]  things and then i add they i give them a response and then i you
[20827.40s -> 20830.28s]  know a couple days go by maybe i don't respond and i'm doing
[20830.28s -> 20833.40s]  something else it's just it's too much i can't spread
[20833.40s -> 20842.41s]  myself that thin so because i know the kind of person
[20842.41s -> 20846.55s]  that i am and that bill bow baggins quote
[20846.55s -> 20851.83s]  spreading yourself too thin um like butter on toast
[20851.83s -> 20854.79s]  toast ends up being fucking disgusting and you don't want to eat it anymore
[20854.79s -> 20859.61s]  gandalf but thank you i really appreciate the
[20859.61s -> 20862.09s]  fact that you'd even want to talk to me in the first place
[20862.09s -> 20866.70s]  demonic cucumber one dollar it's a meme read the comments
[20866.70s -> 20871.29s]  yeah but here okay here's the thing about i don't i don't want to like
[20871.29s -> 20874.49s]  brigade a post that just maybe doesn't belong
[20874.49s -> 20878.25s]  you know what i mean i can't like officially condone something
[20878.25s -> 20884.38s]  that maybe somebody's doing on like a website you know what i mean
[20884.38s -> 20900.14s]  that's maybe doesn't necessarily it's just the germa craft uh it's just the
[20900.14s -> 20915.19s]  germa craft intro these comments yeah i i don't
[20915.19s -> 20919.29s]  because here's the thing i i don't want it's it's that's funny
[20919.29s -> 20924.92s]  it is but i also don't want to i i'm not sure what that way if that
[20924.92s -> 20928.86s]  website is a um i'm not sure what that website is
[20928.86s -> 20932.06s]  i've never really gone to it but i don't want to make
[20932.06s -> 20935.58s]  like a funny joke about you know a place where people maybe
[20935.58s -> 20938.94s]  put stuff where they lose loved ones and you know i that's
[20938.94s -> 20943.45s]  that that doesn't really sit that you know what i mean so i don't
[20943.45s -> 20946.65s]  want that to necessarily be something that i say oh yeah
[20946.65s -> 20956.68s]  look it out you know i'm saying it's funny in our
[20956.68s -> 20959.72s]  it's funny in our context here because we know
[20959.72s -> 20964.22s]  we know we're in we have the joke here but
[20964.22s -> 20967.74s]  i don't want to cause a problem for somebody else i don't want to cause
[20967.74s -> 20971.83s]  an issue or it i like to stay away from that kind of stuff
[20971.83s -> 20977.00s]  so it's funny it is funny because like we
[20977.00s -> 20983.69s]  like i said we know what it is but you understand
[20983.69s -> 20989.29s]  interesting stuff and then finally at the end here we've got
[20989.29s -> 20997.40s]  here we go ready last few uh we've got dark angel for one dollar getting
[20997.40s -> 20999.32s]  late ps i would love to become an active
[20999.32s -> 21003.38s]  streamer like you starting out reading every donations they won't have many
[21003.38s -> 21007.30s]  uh fans to begin with as you did transferring from youtube do you think
[21007.30s -> 21010.42s]  being a twitch streamer is a stable job with enough stop you right there
[21010.42s -> 21019.50s]  i'm gonna stop you right there very important you cannot go into a new
[21019.50s -> 21025.18s]  venture like this with the idea of money being there
[21025.18s -> 21030.34s]  that's not it is i think that is the absolute wrong way to do this
[21030.34s -> 21036.87s]  it's not a stable job it's not something to go into
[21036.87s -> 21039.43s]  hey that's what i'm gonna do for work and that's what i'm gonna do for
[21039.43s -> 21043.75s]  money that's that's that's a that's not the best attitude to have here
[21043.75s -> 21048.55s]  you have to do it and do it because you want to do it because you
[21048.55s -> 21051.67s]  want to not because you want something from it you know what i mean
[21051.67s -> 21054.47s]  you don't money i'm talking monetarily you
[21054.47s -> 21057.19s]  can't go into it thinking it's a job
[21057.19s -> 21060.63s]  because it requires other people to watch to for it to become
[21060.63s -> 21066.26s]  a job so as long as you have an attitude that's not
[21066.26s -> 21073.30s]  there is money but just germa took it all but if you said i was good
[21073.30s -> 21078.02s]  at something never do it for free yeah but you can't have that mentality
[21078.02s -> 21087.03s]  when you start out if you have a goal a monetary goal
[21087.03s -> 21091.29s]  that is let's say a stable income from twitch
[21091.29s -> 21095.13s]  you are preparing you are setting you're setting yourself up for
[21095.13s -> 21098.01s]  disappointment because if you don't get to that
[21098.01s -> 21102.38s]  point that you want to get to that that's a problem because that i
[21102.38s -> 21105.82s]  wanted to do this for work but that's not how it works you
[21106.62s -> 21113.61s]  you can't go into it like that whatever whoever wants to stream if you want to
[21113.61s -> 21116.26s]  be a streamer and you want to be a youtuber
[21116.26s -> 21119.78s]  good fucking luck to you i hope you make great content i hope you put out
[21119.78s -> 21122.10s]  stuff that you're proud of that you think is interesting
[21122.10s -> 21126.02s]  but you can't go into it with the mindset of this is my job
[21126.02s -> 21131.16s]  and i'm gonna do this for money it's i think it's it's it's an attitude
[21131.16s -> 21144.42s]  you have to leave at the door bro luck money but good luck uh
[21144.42s -> 21147.54s]  oogla goob thanks for three bucks not so fast jeremy one more you deserve all
