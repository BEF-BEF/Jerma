[5.62s -> 9.70s]  All right, I'm almost back. I just gotta get my controller, and we can get started. Give me one more sec.
[54.89s -> 57.93s]  Somebody just said Gremlin's 2 sucks, Jeremo.
[58.63s -> 80.28s]  Excuse me? You can't say that here. You can't say that here. That's a banned sentence. All right, let's keep going.
[82.20s -> 88.54s]  So again, thank you Warner Brothers for sponsoring this stream. Season one is underway for multiverses.
[89.32s -> 103.34s]  Morty is in the game, which we haven't seen yet. Gizmo's in the game. I'm excited! Mod that guy. Why would I mod that guy?
[106.55s -> 113.29s]  Oh my god. Wait, wait, wait, hold on. You need a live reaction. You need a live reaction.
[113.53s -> 126.58s]  Come on. You gotta get a live reaction to this. I've been waiting like a hundred years for this.
[132.20s -> 157.03s]  It's Gizmo from Gremlins and Gremlins 2! No, this is really cool. That's not supposed to be that big.
[157.27s -> 168.18s]  So how does he play? Is he good? You guys have had access to this for like the last few hours. Is Gizmo good?
[168.42s -> 179.26s]  All right, hold on. We gotta go to the lab. Yeah, this is part of season one. Yeah, this is Morty.
[179.58s -> 187.19s]  I haven't even unlocked Morty. So I played this on Xbox. So I have two accounts.
[191.03s -> 196.39s]  Uh, is the timer going in the chat? Can you guys tell me? You gotta do the voice?
[196.71s -> 203.50s]  I'm not doing the voice. Should I even unlock Morty? I mean, I kind of, I should, right?
[205.00s -> 213.02s]  Okay, let's unlock. Let's get everybody unlocked and I want to take these people into the lab. There's cross progression.
[213.02s -> 218.25s]  I'm so glad you brought that up because you're absolutely right. There's cross progression across the whole platform.
[218.25s -> 236.23s]  So PC, Xbox, doesn't matter where you are. It's free. Do I even have the battle pass? What do I see there?
[236.23s -> 246.90s]  Oh, hey, I think I do, don't I? What's this? ToonSquad96 unlock premium. Do I, I don't have the battle pass?
[247.22s -> 252.92s]  All right, I probably, I could probably just get it. Let's see what you get. So this is the premium battle pass.
[253.00s -> 255.00s]  You know what my favorite thing about this game is?
[255.45s -> 262.87s]  This stuff. The ring out stuff. When you knock somebody out and you get to see like the cool animation,
[262.87s -> 268.90s]  I can't wait till there's a thousand of these. What do you get them for the very, at the very end?
[269.14s -> 278.41s]  Well, that's app, that's absolutely worth it. Okay. Well, I have to be grinding for that one.
[278.49s -> 289.91s]  I'm gonna spend some time playing. All right, let's go to the lab. I'm so happy to do this. No, get Taz out of here.
[289.91s -> 293.75s]  I don't want to play with Taz. Gizmo.
[295.43s -> 311.56s]  Oh, okay. So he's not tiny. He's not tiny. I got an arrow. Okay. What's, what's, what's the standard combo?
[312.04s -> 320.79s]  That's seems pretty amazing. Is it just those three? Can I charge any of it? No.
[321.43s -> 324.07s]  They changed the hitbox apparently in this update.
[327.16s -> 333.02s]  You can travel really far. All right. So what about the standard? Pretty cool.
[334.06s -> 336.30s]  Just like from the goddamn movie.
[339.51s -> 342.23s]  I don't care. I'll spend all day playing to get better.
[342.87s -> 345.75s]  This is, this is a, this is definitely a moment where I'm going to play as hard as I can.
[346.23s -> 348.90s]  All right. So let me hold on.
[348.90s -> 354.12s]  So that's okay. That's that's the air too and it arcs.
[354.84s -> 357.24s]  Oh, yeah, that's fucking awesome. All right. So that's on cooldown now.
[358.60s -> 360.60s]  Oh my god, it's just like the movie.
[361.48s -> 366.65s]  All right, so what about down?
[366.65s -> 370.50s]  What?
[370.50s -> 371.94s]  Popcorn?
[371.94s -> 375.53s]  See, yeah, this is my bat chest moment guys. I'm sorry. It really is.
[376.34s -> 381.78s]  This is my, this is my bat chest moment. I get to have this. Um, what is it? What do they do? They linger?
[387.13s -> 392.31s]  That seems amazing.
[392.31s -> 394.23s]  All right, you can do popcorn.
[394.23s -> 398.34s]  Okay, cool. So what about the uh, what about specials?
[401.10s -> 403.42s]  He sings and dances. Okay, that's perfect. What does that do?
[406.57s -> 408.57s]  I think because he's a support, right?
[410.52s -> 412.76s]  Let's do all that stuff. That's crazy.
[415.27s -> 417.34s]  He doesn't have a smash move.
[417.34s -> 420.78s]  It doesn't look like a power. I guess that could be it, but it's not I don't think it has knockout power.
[422.33s -> 428.12s]  Find out. All right. So that's singing dance. We can look it up. You go into the box.
[430.50s -> 433.18s]  Ooh.
[433.18s -> 435.18s]  All right.
[435.18s -> 436.94s]  So that turns into that.
[436.94s -> 439.43s]  Is it defense?
[439.43s -> 444.02s]  Arrow popcorn.
[444.02s -> 446.82s]  Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Hold on.
[448.82s -> 450.42s]  Yeah.
[450.42s -> 455.08s]  Oh, I feel it.
[455.08s -> 457.08s]  So you really want to get that out there and just like
[457.70s -> 459.78s]  Don't die in the lab. That'll be embarrassing.
[464.26s -> 466.26s]  Okay, that's actually pretty cool.
[466.26s -> 468.26s]  Now, what about uh,
[469.16s -> 471.16s]  Up special is sort of just a little jump.
[472.62s -> 476.62s]  Which that seems kind of dangerous because it's not very far. All right.
[479.90s -> 481.90s]  Music is really loud.
[483.26s -> 488.33s]  All right. I'll turn it on. You can drive the little car.
[489.46s -> 493.74s]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[501.70s -> 506.31s]  Yeah, you can't swear. What?
[507.03s -> 509.83s]  No, i'm fine.
[509.83s -> 511.83s]  Jeremy, you are clamp.
[512.87s -> 514.87s]  Uh, there is a deep fake
[515.88s -> 525.69s]  With me as mr. Clamp if you've never seen it before it's actually pretty funny. That's better. Okay
[527.29s -> 529.93s]  So you really oh the umbrella. What is that?
[530.57s -> 540.90s]  Okay, you can float around. All right. So down special was that I gotta let's do some reading
[554.39s -> 569.78s]  Oh, yeah
[569.78s -> 575.85s]  So I wonder what the what the singing does. All right, let's do some reading. Where is it?
[575.93s -> 578.01s]  He you can read what can you move? Let's here we go. All right
[582.28s -> 587.32s]  Some of gizmos attacks apply a music buff affected enemies are silenced if they reach the max stack count
[587.72s -> 590.52s]  Stopping them from using cooldown abilities effect abilities will create a musical note
[592.01s -> 594.89s]  Rhythm allows the bard to play magical tunes
[595.61s -> 602.20s]  When they evade hitting overlapping enemies, okay popcorn it can be ignited
[602.20s -> 607.59s]  We know that gizmo charges before slamming a keyboard dealing armor break. All right
[608.30s -> 610.06s]  What's the what does it get in the box one?
[610.06s -> 616.55s]  This one here gizmo hops on a toy chest which blocks projectiles hold input to stay in the chest
[616.87s -> 621.70s]  While attached to an ally he will hold out an umbrella for a similar effect on his ally. All right
[621.94s -> 635.94s]  All right, let's fucking go. I'm ready. Let's give it a try who wants to queue up and get your ass kicked
[643.54s -> 645.30s]  Here comes the heat
[645.30s -> 661.48s]  Oh, right. That was lebron. You're a bozo. You should play as morty
[661.56s -> 663.56s]  I don't I don't know really how to play as morty
[663.80s -> 675.19s]  This is gizmo only for a little while just for a little while when it's stripe
[675.27s -> 685.18s]  Yeah, apparently stripes gonna be in the game too. All right, I don't have the skin. Oh, well, that's fine
[685.74s -> 694.34s]  You have to do the gizmo voice while you play. Okay, hold on. There's a way to do it
[694.34s -> 696.34s]  It's still kind of like this, right?
[700.39s -> 707.08s]  I'll get in here. I don't have any perks
[707.08s -> 709.40s]  All right, let's see if I can do this one v one with gizmos probably bad idea
[709.40s -> 718.65s]  But whatever i'm gonna get beat up for a little while show them what we got. That's that's stitch
[719.21s -> 724.73s]  Don't they that they have
[724.73s -> 730.92s]  That's auto gizmo is supposed to be support. He seems like really actually pretty fun to play
[732.12s -> 737.56s]  As a solo character too. All right, let's go. I've been waiting 20. Oh, and I gotta tweet. I have to tweet this
[737.88s -> 739.88s]  I'll tweet it after i'll tweet it
[739.96s -> 763.32s]  Oh, don't touch those musical notes
[771.13s -> 789.82s]  You can shoot it up that combo get there. I get the combo get the combo going
[790.70s -> 798.26s]  just
[798.26s -> 803.34s]  Run over the car
[803.34s -> 805.02s]  Whoa, that was a good combo
[805.02s -> 821.70s]  I gotta charge that more often
[837.45s -> 845.74s]  Oh
[845.74s -> 857.77s]  one for blue
[861.37s -> 863.37s]  That stomp is awesome, too. This one here
[864.01s -> 866.01s]  Has a lot of priority. It feels like
[866.01s -> 880.86s]  All right. That's good. Good warm-up. That's good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. I told you we got where's my phone
[881.82s -> 883.82s]  I gotta tweet. I forgot to tweet
[885.62s -> 887.22s]  He's fun to play
[887.22s -> 891.75s]  play again
[891.75s -> 898.84s]  Yes
[898.84s -> 903.00s]  Oh this is I forgot. This is what the the tweet I was gonna do was. Oh, that's fine. Yeah, that's fine
[903.72s -> 906.54s]  Is that a good one? I said I said I was gonna be crying
[907.34s -> 912.33s]  I can't oh, no, I did that joke. It's fine
[912.33s -> 914.33s]  All right. I gotta get used to the move set
[915.69s -> 928.92s]  Wait, no, I just tweeted. Hold on. I mean look at him
[933.80s -> 936.44s]  Oh
[936.44s -> 948.73s]  He's so it's he's perfect. He's he's actually perfect. It's one of my actually favorite movies ever
[949.21s -> 961.69s]  It's just i'm so happy to see him in the game
[962.98s -> 965.62s]  For the longest time I never thought they were ever doing anything with gremlins ever again
[983.61s -> 986.81s]  They're making a third movie. I don't know what they're doing. They're doing aren't they doing like an animated thing?
[991.98s -> 996.58s]  Uh-oh versus a bugs. It's my old best friend
[998.66s -> 1016.22s]  I better be uh, be careful. Why are you so weird? I don't know blame this movie. I wish that was a joke
[1027.32s -> 1033.29s]  All right, so it's down the down special is the really only knockout potential that he has
[1042.50s -> 1045.38s]  No, no, no, no, no. No. Oh, he doesn't know he doesn't know he doesn't know
[1046.10s -> 1075.86s]  I screwed that up. Sorry. Oh I can drive that car
[1076.58s -> 1102.30s]  What are you doing? Give me that sandwich
[1126.74s -> 1148.65s]  I just looked over and saw that it's not you're fucking with me now
[1161.22s -> 1163.22s]  So how did the hitboxes change?
[1163.70s -> 1185.72s]  Excuse me
[1185.72s -> 1198.25s]  You don't like the camera. Why not? I told you we got this
[1198.89s -> 1203.32s]  What's my favorite type of pizza?
[1203.32s -> 1205.32s]  standard pepperoni thin crust
[1211.86s -> 1213.86s]  And it's gotta be crunchy it's gonna be crispy on the bottom
[1214.34s -> 1217.70s]  I wanted to be crispy and crunchy on the bottom and it better be where i'm gonna be
[1219.22s -> 1220.50s]  What's happening?
[1220.50s -> 1231.88s]  Wait, what's going on? So look there the hitbox is different. So it's now tied to their actual animations
[1233.49s -> 1241.44s]  Before it was kind of a little square or oval around them. The hitboxes I think have shrunk a little
[1242.08s -> 1246.16s]  Interesting. All right. Is that a better is that a good thing or a bad thing? It seems I can't really notice
[1247.12s -> 1250.15s]  Feels pretty good so far
[1250.15s -> 1260.36s]  I think it's pretty good
[1260.36s -> 1263.26s]  I had a dream that you went to my university graduation
[1263.88s -> 1268.28s]  And drank my grandmother's ashes in a milkshake before I was meant to go on stage. It was awkward
[1270.07s -> 1280.87s]  Stop fucking eating after midnight. You know what happens? Come on. Show them what we got
[1281.67s -> 1293.80s]  What what I was in the stands I was in the audience. Where did I get it? Why would I have that?
[1311.06s -> 1321.80s]  Wrong way. I'm used to the way that bugs plays. I gotta get used to uh gizmo. I love it though. He's great
[1322.52s -> 1350.23s]  Hmm, that's okay. You got to feel that up way earlier. It's a great move though
[1361.27s -> 1427.20s]  All right, come on one for blue does the singing hurt anybody I feel like it doesn't oops
[1428.72s -> 1434.48s]  We're good. We're good. We're good
[1435.36s -> 1437.36s]  I told you we got this
[1437.52s -> 1439.52s]  Why is the gremlin so big? Well
[1442.20s -> 1445.64s]  How can we play like you're orchestrating a band because I move around a lot
[1449.52s -> 1451.52s]  You look like you you'd like to suck lemons
[1455.20s -> 1458.32s]  Wait, who are you? Why what are you doing here? Why are you being so mean to me?
[1462.37s -> 1465.96s]  Here comes the heat. Let me go. Let me go read something. Hold on. Should I try morty?
[1466.76s -> 1476.15s]  Oh a few more games with gizmo if I play with morty, um
[1476.79s -> 1478.48s]  Should I do the voice?
[1478.48s -> 1487.32s]  All right. I want to read this because i'm trying to find an opportunity at least in solo to do that. Oh
[1489.48s -> 1492.10s]  Can't read it here comes the heat
[1494.82s -> 1496.90s]  This camera angle if you were here in the beginning of the stream
[1497.38s -> 1507.56s]  Uh, oh, all right, definitely want that and that's good just to have
[1513.80s -> 1517.08s]  I'll do some teams to it because I think you can shoot the arrow at a teammate
[1517.64s -> 1563.16s]  Show them what we got
[1563.16s -> 1565.16s]  Oh, I keep forgetting about the car
[1571.48s -> 1580.92s]  Get out of there
[1580.92s -> 1583.54s]  Get out of the car. Stop it
[1583.54s -> 1584.42s]  stop
[1584.42s -> 1596.47s]  Where's my car?
[1596.47s -> 1597.35s]  Yeah
[1597.35s -> 1616.05s]  Get away from me. You want where you want to go for it?
[1617.08s -> 1621.00s]  No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, wait, wait, wait, get your car. Oh, you want to go for it?
[1621.88s -> 1639.33s]  Hey, I want whatever
[1639.33s -> 1652.64s]  No, don't shoot me don't
[1669.20s -> 1684.04s]  One for blue
[1684.04s -> 1716.36s]  Get out of that car
[1717.32s -> 1721.51s]  I'm off to read a 3 000 word essay, but how much I don't like you
[1729.27s -> 1732.24s]  Don't
[1732.24s -> 1738.90s]  Do you see how happy i've been with this gizmo is in the game, man
[1740.88s -> 1746.16s]  Here comes the heat you're doing cvd water. Oh my goodness. I forgot. This was there the whole round
[1747.04s -> 1754.92s]  That's so stupid cvd water in your eyes
[1771.04s -> 1774.64s]  The point is to get gizmo leveled up as fast as possible to get his ultimate perk
[1780.18s -> 1781.83s]  Show him what we got
[1781.83s -> 1785.25s]  Wait, that looks wrong
[1785.25s -> 1787.25s]  Yeah, the reason why I changed the angle of the camera is because
[1787.65s -> 1794.36s]  It used to shake because the monitor that it was sitting on would always move whenever I moved it was really annoying
[1795.14s -> 1798.34s]  It looks fucked up
[1798.34s -> 1800.34s]  Well, i'll fix it next time
[1800.50s -> 1847.48s]  What the hell just happened? That was weird
[1847.56s -> 1857.60s]  Good combo good combo
[1857.60s -> 1899.30s]  Water in my eyes one for blue. I need my arrows
[1900.02s -> 1926.00s]  That's a good. That's a good finisher. That's a good finisher. We got this
[1927.56s -> 1936.12s]  That butt slam is amazing if you can get it continue
[1937.24s -> 1940.63s]  That was a good game though
[1940.63s -> 1944.31s]  Do a different face cam. Oh, I can do this right fine. I'll do the funny thing for everybody
[1956.82s -> 1961.14s]  It really does look like someone's coming out of that door piano wire
[1962.28s -> 1966.84s]  They're gonna come out of that door with piano wire and i'm gonna get hit manned on stream. That's what that is
[1967.92s -> 1969.92s]  Yeah, I wonder what's gonna happen in that door
[1975.89s -> 1995.80s]  It's a full monster costume persons coming out of there. Here comes the heat
[1998.24s -> 2001.12s]  Something looks so strange about that too. It looks wrong
[2005.08s -> 2037.30s]  Monsters ink door. Oh morty. What does morty do? That's a lie. I know what morty does make it bigger
[2037.62s -> 2044.29s]  Show them what we got what a png of an iphone around the camera
[2048.98s -> 2070.16s]  Why all right first, let me just uh, let me do some are we are we playing or what are you what are you up to?
[2070.72s -> 2074.32s]  Wait, what are you what are you up to? All right, we're playing. All right, let's go
[2075.12s -> 2095.60s]  All right, let's get a vacuum cleaner he how did you dodge the car? All right, I gotta be quiet
[2100.36s -> 2102.36s]  I gotta be shut up
[2102.36s -> 2105.16s]  I wasn't in the game. I was too busy thinking about the fucking face cam
[2172.53s -> 2173.89s]  I'm sloppy
[2173.89s -> 2200.77s]  What is that?
[2200.77s -> 2202.93s]  200 almost what the hell?
[2213.76s -> 2215.92s]  40 I mean, come on morty
[2286.05s -> 2308.96s]  Oh
[2316.87s -> 2321.75s]  Oh, what a fucking match oh what a match oh that was close
[2323.44s -> 2327.44s]  Oh, I thought I had it on those down. Uh, damn it on the left side
[2329.03s -> 2331.03s]  Oh, that's close
[2332.64s -> 2339.04s]  Uh, yeah, sure. Okay
[2339.76s -> 2346.85s]  All right, i'm back here comes the heat
[2347.33s -> 2353.64s]  Morty's got a lot of projectiles, huh?
[2353.64s -> 2364.16s]  Okay, that's better. That was so close to I do you see on the left side?
[2364.24s -> 2370.71s]  I did the down boom boom. He recovered down boom boom recovered again. I just couldn't follow up. That's a good match though. It's like
[2373.54s -> 2374.90s]  His most fun
[2374.90s -> 2388.45s]  Who's my favorite gremlin?
[2388.45s -> 2392.32s]  Uh, that would be I think the name of the gremlin is actually daffy
[2394.69s -> 2405.04s]  Daffy was my favorite gremlin morty is a mage more of a mage than a bruiser
[2406.74s -> 2411.40s]  um
[2411.40s -> 2415.48s]  No, not daffy duck. All right. Hold on. I gotta be quiet. I gotta be gamer uh gamer time
[2416.12s -> 2466.20s]  wrong way
[2466.20s -> 2489.80s]  Oh
[2489.80s -> 2491.80s]  That's all right. Sorry ready three two one
[2531.97s -> 2533.97s]  What the fuck I teleported
[2535.20s -> 2537.44s]  No, why do I keep facing the wrong way new controller?
[2538.16s -> 2572.24s]  Sounds like a chicken. I thought that was a chicken sound
[2572.96s -> 2613.49s]  Went right over his head
[2613.49s -> 2636.60s]  Come on that fucking launch power
[2643.57s -> 2652.47s]  Close good one. Good one. Good fight. Good fight. Good fight. That was a close one
[2654.37s -> 2657.33s]  Continue. I mean we kind of have to do it. There's a best out of three here
[2657.89s -> 2666.71s]  We gotta do it again. Hold on. Wait, we have to follow up
[2667.72s -> 2671.08s]  No, no, no, like you were shaking my grandmother's ashes in a protein shake
[2671.88s -> 2677.48s]  When the dean called out my name and was meant to shake my hand you ran past me and drank the frothy milkshake
[2683.20s -> 2691.06s]  What's wrong with you? Wait, did I miss the opportunity? Oh shit. That's all right. Let's stick with the tie
[2694.00s -> 2697.94s]  I thought I hit rematch didn't I I guess I didn't here comes the heat
[2701.70s -> 2705.01s]  All right. Let's do some
[2705.01s -> 2707.65s]  Let's do some team stuff. I want to check the uh, the gizmo team stuff
[2712.39s -> 2713.83s]  teams and
[2713.83s -> 2718.74s]  free-for-all maybe here comes the heat
[2719.30s -> 2725.94s]  Because i'm curious. I think you can shoot the arrow at your teammate. Oh, they didn't rematch. Oh, it's all right
[2726.34s -> 2733.73s]  Go to the end of the options and increase the dead zone on your controller
[2736.68s -> 2747.28s]  Yeah, how do I do that? Oh wait horizontal dead zone. What what so?
[2748.00s -> 2750.16s]  Yeah, I keep not wanting to be facing that direction
[2750.80s -> 2759.17s]  What should I put this at?
[2759.17s -> 2772.04s]  Higher or lower 40 percent. What vertical should these both be the same?
[2779.09s -> 2781.49s]  You should lower it if you feel like you're not getting an input red
[2781.97s -> 2783.81s]  It's mainly when I hit left
[2783.81s -> 2790.90s]  So I try to turn and then by the time I turn left and want to let go to do the neutral, uh arrow move
[2791.54s -> 2796.87s]  He's still facing right
[2796.87s -> 2799.75s]  Do you know if we're gonna get the sexy gremlin as a skin? I have no idea
[2800.07s -> 2806.24s]  So it should be higher or lower then make it smaller then i'll try 20
[2808.90s -> 2819.59s]  See if 20 does it
[2821.91s -> 2829.65s]  Use the second stick for reverse moves. Um, not with gizmo because gizmo is standard
[2830.29s -> 2835.60s]  Um, just standard attack is the bow so I can't use right stick to aim it
[2835.92s -> 2842.44s]  It has to be standard attack two gizmos. This is gonna be interesting. All right, let's go. Let's do it
[2854.98s -> 2858.26s]  Show them what we got. How come you're not eating any carrots because i'm not playing as bugs
[2858.74s -> 2865.60s]  Hey bugs is old news to me right now second daffy gets put into the game. You know it
[2866.24s -> 2874.05s]  All right. Let's see if we can do this with two gizmos
[2888.00s -> 2891.78s]  Just get in the car
[2891.78s -> 2895.89s]  I think they nerfed jake a lot too, by the way
[2896.61s -> 2899.17s]  From what I saw on the patch notes. He got pretty much every move got nerfed
[2899.89s -> 2903.60s]  We can drive each other's cars. I think too
[2916.85s -> 2939.17s]  Oh
[2939.17s -> 2953.89s]  Oh, I thought you're gonna jump oh I could get a double here so cleanly if I could just do it
[2965.08s -> 2966.12s]  Oh
[2966.12s -> 2969.40s]  That does not have priority anymore. Does it that was was that part of the nerve?
[2979.38s -> 2981.38s]  Shit, all right, we gotta get this jake out of here
[3001.43s -> 3002.95s]  Oh shit
[3002.95s -> 3008.00s]  We gotta get rid of this jake
[3008.00s -> 3032.10s]  That was huge
[3032.10s -> 3034.10s]  Nah, that dead zone. I gotta change it
[3051.64s -> 3056.37s]  Stop that's it
[3057.17s -> 3075.75s]  Big point for red
[3075.75s -> 3081.03s]  Yeah, we just can't launch anybody shake it off. We only getting stuck. We just could not get that uh,
[3081.59s -> 3082.87s]  Darn it out of here
[3082.87s -> 3092.72s]  play again
[3092.72s -> 3095.96s]  Let's go
[3095.96s -> 3098.68s]  Your dead zone dead zone should be higher 40 to 60
[3099.40s -> 3103.64s]  Yeah, I always have the problem where i'm trying to turn the other way and then do the standard
[3104.12s -> 3109.54s]  Attack move and I just am not turning try it. Uh, let me try that is it like 60
[3110.02s -> 3115.52s]  That's cool that you can actually do this in the game though
[3115.76s -> 3123.68s]  So it needs to be like higher you're saying like that if you're not turning lower the dead zone
[3124.47s -> 3126.47s]  Do 60 30 try 60 30
[3126.71s -> 3131.35s]  Try it
[3131.35s -> 3137.41s]  Oh my god. I want it. Let's get to work
[3139.96s -> 3141.96s]  Then you wipe decrease it. Okay
[3142.36s -> 3149.08s]  Lebron is bugged really
[3156.52s -> 3166.37s]  I want it. Show them what we got. Are you a fan of american edm?
[3167.52s -> 3169.52s]  I don't really listen to that much music. So
[3169.84s -> 3172.24s]  I mean, I like a lot of stuff, but I don't really listen to a lot
[3184.15s -> 3188.87s]  Hey, my sister just ate the last swiss roll. Wait, wait, you you have the stream muted. You can't even hear me
[3189.75s -> 3227.89s]  Oh, that was lagging
[3227.89s -> 3229.89s]  Getting my ass kicked here
[3242.26s -> 3251.48s]  What? Holy shit, I went flying
[3269.12s -> 3281.32s]  People weird teleporting around oh my god get down there
[3283.00s -> 3300.80s]  You know, my biggest problem with teams is I just it's hard. I don't know who to pay attention
[3300.80s -> 3304.48s]  I don't know who paid to pay. You know what i'm saying porky fucking pig will be in the game at some point
[3317.16s -> 3325.03s]  This is unacceptable
[3334.84s -> 3336.84s]  Big point for red
[3341.48s -> 3349.83s]  My ball
[3349.83s -> 3369.92s]  Holy shit. Oh shit. Shake it up. We're only getting started
[3371.36s -> 3373.44s]  He's on mcdonald's wi-fi. No, mom
[3374.08s -> 3385.20s]  Yeah, I did. I want to do more one v ones. Here comes the heat
[3385.84s -> 3399.84s]  That's where that's where I i've shined here comes the heat. We demand gizmo. I'll do okay. Let's let's go back to gizmo
[3404.28s -> 3410.28s]  The team-based stuff is so is awesome in this game. It's just I I need to know what when to do what that's my problem
[3411.08s -> 3415.24s]  Everybody has these awesome
[3415.24s -> 3420.58s]  Kind of co-op moves just trying to be like oh do I should do it now?
[3421.38s -> 3429.75s]  Comes with game knowledge
[3430.55s -> 3433.11s]  I've seen some insane duo stuff though
[3438.68s -> 3451.28s]  Skill issue. Oh, yeah, that is what I am admitting to you right now. I look like I made it a nail polish remover. Yeah
[3481.33s -> 3482.85s]  Oh
[3482.85s -> 3504.56s]  And that dead zone by the way help. Oh a million percent. That's so much better
[3506.39s -> 3532.44s]  Thank you advice andy
[3536.58s -> 3559.60s]  Okay
[3560.32s -> 3596.24s]  All right, i'm getting fucking dunked on in this second around here let's go
[3605.14s -> 3607.14s]  Shake it up. We're only getting started
[3613.35s -> 3615.78s]  We both went like this
[3617.08s -> 3620.79s]  And then I just freaked out and died
[3620.95s -> 3622.15s]  Okay
[3622.15s -> 3629.81s]  By the way, this stream is sponsored by wonder brothers. Thank you wonder brothers season one of multiverses is here comes the heat underway
[3632.02s -> 3633.88s]  gizmo morty
[3633.88s -> 3645.53s]  They've both been added cross together over here cross progression, by the way, you see playstation
[3646.07s -> 3658.68s]  Can you guess the other one? Oh, no, I hate fighting jakes
[3659.24s -> 3681.73s]  Show them what we got. I actually think they're actually gonna add ranked at some point here, too. I would have frame andy. Oh
[3682.74s -> 3684.53s]  oh
[3684.53s -> 3687.92s]  Steven
[3722.61s -> 3742.45s]  Tell me that careful
[3752.61s -> 3756.48s]  Who went down, I don't know what the fuck happened what
[3758.61s -> 3760.61s]  I traded places with him
[3762.47s -> 3779.40s]  That was so good
[3779.40s -> 3781.56s]  Oh now i'm gonna get fucking diarrhea on
[3814.72s -> 3822.98s]  One for blue
[3823.46s -> 3845.72s]  Give me the car
[3855.73s -> 3867.81s]  Let's go
[3867.81s -> 3871.09s]  Oh, come on shake it up. We're only getting started
[3873.35s -> 3877.27s]  I completely forgot that the arrows had cooled down and then I freaked out and then I just stopped playing
[3877.99s -> 3885.94s]  See dude, just gotta keep punching till there's no one left to punch. Here comes the heat
[3890.24s -> 3900.50s]  That was important this has all been warm up until now this has all been warm up until right now
[3900.90s -> 3914.66s]  Can you please read a book on stream? Which one?
[3915.14s -> 3918.85s]  You have a favorite book show them what we got
[3919.49s -> 3929.81s]  Somebody said will they take the sponsorship away if you keep losing no, that's not how it works
[3934.02s -> 3936.02s]  Hey, I am way above 500 right now
[3936.58s -> 3939.48s]  I've only lost like three times. I'm not losing this one
[4019.35s -> 4088.76s]  You dodged that one that didn't hit all right. All right. All right
[4128.93s -> 4131.81s]  I have no idea what happened there. I think lagged out maybe
[4143.03s -> 4153.67s]  Wait, you're cheating I didn't do anything. Okay, um the season pass
[4154.39s -> 4156.47s]  I should feel like I should have it. I feel like I should just get it
[4166.82s -> 4173.59s]  Can you do a sleep stream now? Here comes the heat. Is there any hold on?
[4179.80s -> 4185.11s]  Ismo's air down special can bounce off his popcorn and his toy car
[4185.91s -> 4192.58s]  To detonate them instantly. Wait, what? So that's the butt drop
[4195.41s -> 4198.37s]  So I can butt drop my car and blow them up. That's pretty cool
[4199.54s -> 4200.58s]  Okay
[4200.58s -> 4208.71s]  So you can be attached to someone
[4212.58s -> 4215.94s]  I haven't been using the music at all. I don't even know what it does
[4216.34s -> 4233.27s]  I've just been kind of just trying to get people. I want that cool. What about um, is there any gremlins?
[4233.75s -> 4254.40s]  Uh, uh, where is it? Yeah, are there any new gremlins ring outs or anything cannonball? Cool
[4260.92s -> 4281.72s]  Bossamer cool green lantern. Is there any gremlin stuff? No. All right. No gremlin ring outs
[4281.72s -> 4291.99s]  What about banners? I think the only one is the gizmo one, right? Please read that popcorn book
[4292.23s -> 4301.96s]  I want the gizmo one. All right, what about announcer? Is there a gizmo announcer?
[4306.79s -> 4311.81s]  Do I have enough to buy this?
[4311.81s -> 4321.28s]  Oh, I can get it. All right. I got the skin. Nice
[4331.24s -> 4334.88s]  I'll do another team fight and we're gonna do team fight. Who got the most changes?
[4340.12s -> 4357.88s]  It looks like bugs got changed a lot too. This patch is as of what today yesterday, dude. This guy brought combat gear
[4358.12s -> 4367.32s]  Yeah, trying i'm trying a little too hard here. You should read moby dick. I'm studying it
[4367.56s -> 4378.12s]  Would you guys actually watch a moby dick stream? I feel like people wouldn't isn't it long though
[4378.52s -> 4380.69s]  I don't really want to read that
[4427.91s -> 4433.03s]  Oh didn't hit
[4438.80s -> 4440.80s]  That's not gizmo talking. That was weird
[4457.16s -> 4467.92s]  Oh
[4467.92s -> 4503.27s]  Whoops wrong way
[4503.27s -> 4505.27s]  Oh, you got me with it. Nice shot
[4531.11s -> 4533.35s]  Oh his car had better priority than my car
[4542.85s -> 4545.60s]  What do you mean for halloween gizmo
[4556.71s -> 4558.50s]  That's a good bench
[4558.50s -> 4566.13s]  I I almost got caught like three or four times that could have gone either way
[4568.29s -> 4578.58s]  I keep getting cut off. Oh, it's because i'm an idiot you guys want to see anybody
[4578.74s -> 4580.74s]  Didn't superman get a bunch of changes too?
[4595.76s -> 4604.24s]  Side profile andy. All right. I'm gonna move you from there to here. I gotta find a way to get you over there though
[4606.68s -> 4607.96s]  I just did
[4607.96s -> 4624.82s]  You're not shaking anymore, which is so much better the announcer. I got a different announcer. It has
[4666.00s -> 4666.88s]  Oh
[4666.88s -> 4669.72s]  Brat
[4669.72s -> 4690.80s]  We're just playing bumper cars at this point. Why is the car still here?
[4731.41s -> 4749.78s]  Oh charged good fight good fight
[4754.07s -> 4756.72s]  Gizmo is so fun
[4756.72s -> 4763.00s]  Gizmo is so fun
[4763.00s -> 4776.18s]  Not too complicated either. Just really really clean move set. I love it. Oh, I'm most of that. Okay. I want to get to that car
[4778.98s -> 4780.26s]  Come on
[4780.26s -> 4790.08s]  Character they added austin powers with the would you play with him for a whole stream? Yeah
[4790.64s -> 4801.04s]  I'm gonna buy a new announcer. I'll get a new announcer. I don't think I have enough currency left though
[4814.28s -> 4816.96s]  You're gonna play 20 minutes till dawn
[4816.96s -> 4830.72s]  I actually really do want to return to that that game was a blast. All right, let's go
[4830.96s -> 4881.59s]  I've been on a pretty good streak here
[4881.59s -> 4883.59s]  Holy shit, we couldn't even hit each other
[4883.59s -> 4886.34s]  That was that was kind of wild actually
[4886.66s -> 4915.91s]  This is gonna be interesting. Okay
[4966.52s -> 4997.49s]  Whoa
[4997.65s -> 5015.16s]  That's gonna be close no our cars
[5037.52s -> 5054.82s]  That was close good game damn, let's go again, okay, is the announcer the announcer's tabs
[5059.59s -> 5062.55s]  Pick character. Yeah, I wonder how many uh, how many
[5063.35s -> 5067.78s]  People are not believing. What's the record this dream? It's got to be
[5069.00s -> 5070.76s]  It's got to be at least
[5070.76s -> 5082.85s]  70 win streak or win rate, right? Although I might hit gamer fatigue at some point here soon. I'm not sure
[5083.57s -> 5090.48s]  It could happen at any moment. I just don't know when I can check. Oh, okay. I'll do it after this
[5094.76s -> 5111.27s]  start time
[5111.51s -> 5114.69s]  New gamer award. All right, let's go bro
[5141.78s -> 5143.30s]  Oh nice
[5144.20s -> 5176.90s]  Okay. All right
[5195.09s -> 5197.09s]  Shit
[5274.84s -> 5277.88s]  Oh got tripped up on the left side that was close that was close
[5284.66s -> 5287.06s]  That was really really. Oh, that's unfortunate
[5291.14s -> 5294.98s]  I was trying to I I don't know if when he looked over and he saw the car
[5295.70s -> 5297.70s]  Because I was trying to drop the car on him
[5297.94s -> 5302.24s]  Because when he was recovering the car was gonna hit him right in the head and just take him out
[5302.64s -> 5304.64s]  Maybe he tried to avoid the car and I don't know
[5305.20s -> 5317.73s]  What's up with the land tournament camera angle?
[5321.28s -> 5324.64s]  No, that's not accurate it would be right in front of me and down
[5325.81s -> 5334.82s]  No, it would be up here and facing down right in front of the monitor in the center. This is podcaster angle. Yeah
[5350.47s -> 5353.91s]  The mic in frame is a choice. No, it's not I got nowhere else to put it
[5354.96s -> 5360.58s]  If I put it down, you won't be able to hear me. Everyone will call me audio andy. All right, let me read this
[5363.27s -> 5369.62s]  So I can down special on the popcorn and the cars to blow them up. That's pretty like pretty cool
[5380.36s -> 5383.76s]  Mike shouldn't be that far from your mouth. Wait, what?
[5384.32s -> 5386.32s]  Here's the thing if it's here
[5386.95s -> 5391.09s]  Then I I can't see the screen this sucks
[5392.23s -> 5394.23s]  All right, i'll try one match like this
[5394.69s -> 5400.40s]  And you can't see my face
[5400.40s -> 5419.24s]  No, I can't see the screen. What the hell is that?
[5419.88s -> 5422.50s]  What's that? That was crazy. I don't know what he's doing
[5422.90s -> 5450.24s]  What is he doing? I I can do that. Can I do that move?
[5451.04s -> 5496.28s]  Oh, we both did it
[5498.12s -> 5506.44s]  All right, let's go let's go come on

[5641.01s -> 5643.51s]  interesting
[5643.51s -> 5645.51s]  Iron giant versus gizmo
[5645.67s -> 5650.13s]  I feel like i'm gonna get pretty destroyed here
[5657.08s -> 5659.08s]  start time
[5659.64s -> 5664.05s]  Your title would be lying. I don't know if it'd be lying
[5664.77s -> 5670.05s]  I

[5787.19s -> 5789.19s]  I knew this was gonna be a major problem
[5796.07s -> 5798.07s]  What the fuck to die?
[5804.61s -> 5806.61s]  I'm too small to get rid of them
[5806.69s -> 5815.59s]  Okay

[5845.48s -> 5847.48s]  Come on
[5848.28s -> 5851.49s]  I don't have superman
[5851.49s -> 5859.46s]  What didn't I have didn't I unlock superman? He's level seven. Oh, he was free rotation
[5869.08s -> 5871.08s]  All right, I gotta remember how to play with superman
[5877.36s -> 5879.35s]  Change the announcer
[5879.35s -> 5889.65s]  I don't have any other announcers
[5889.65s -> 5893.57s]  I have lebron taz and then the default right? I don't think I have anybody else
[5906.96s -> 5913.94s]  Change it back to lebron
[5916.61s -> 5918.61s]  All right, let's make this happen
[5918.61s -> 5968.64s]  I threw him up
[6005.30s -> 6007.30s]  Let's go i'm done with this
[6008.66s -> 6011.35s]  Steel
[6062.29s -> 6091.81s]  Are you kidding me what what the fuck
[6095.73s -> 6122.18s]  You just can't watch him so he just says you suck
[6127.73s -> 6153.25s]  I'm, no i'm not naked your mic cuts. It's because I scream too much and my audio sucks. I keep forgetting to do the um announcer
[6163.95s -> 6166.37s]  professional andy about professional andy I
[6167.89s -> 6171.25s]  We're gonna we're gonna see just how good and it does feel weird looking all though
[6171.25s -> 6222.82s]  You have no idea how far away you are. It's strange. All right, let's go. Let's go. What the hell I pressed buttons and it didn't happen
[6223.46s -> 6227.81s]  Hey, dude, did you see that stun?
[6290.18s -> 6295.24s]  Oh nice
[6295.24s -> 6321.80s]  Ooh

[6452.13s -> 6455.09s]  Why do you have to judge people for the way they eat their pizza?
[6467.11s -> 6469.11s]  Eat it cross-side first
[6469.11s -> 6476.85s]  Like here, all right, that was I think that's a good gizmo one to go out on let's uh, let's try morty i'll try morty
[6482.58s -> 6490.02s]  Oh now sir. Oh my god. I keep forgetting. I'm sorry. I have no idea what morty does. So let's just kind of get beat here
[6490.66s -> 6496.84s]  This is kind of free points
[6496.84s -> 6498.36s]  I'm very honest
[6498.36s -> 6516.82s]  Do the voice just wait till I fall off the screen accidentally. You'll hear it
[6527.62s -> 6534.92s]  These moves do but they're cool. It's it really does sound like a chicken or a turkey
[6545.67s -> 6559.68s]  Oh look at me
[6559.76s -> 6561.76s]  I like that line, too
[6590.90s -> 6613.00s]  He's kind of cracked if i'm honest this he's kind of ridiculous what the heck
[6652.87s -> 6654.87s]  All right, i'm not gonna get lost come on
[6674.93s -> 6676.93s]  Oh, I didn't know what the moves were
[6678.42s -> 6680.42s]  He's kind of cracked. I just don't know what he does
[6685.33s -> 6690.29s]  Oh jeez was this match more than you bargained for rematch, okay
[6691.33s -> 6697.35s]  You just do another you laugh you lose
[6698.39s -> 6700.39s]  We can set it up
[6701.03s -> 6703.03s]  Uh, let's go back to the trident true
[6707.84s -> 6719.76s]  See if I still got it
[6719.76s -> 6725.86s]  I could have had that if I uh, if I tried to really pull that together. I probably could have had it start time
[6729.27s -> 6731.27s]  They nerfed bugs. They well they did
[6732.74s -> 6735.06s]  He was really good though bugs was amazing
[6737.38s -> 6740.84s]  So makes sense
[6785.28s -> 6852.21s]  Really almost had it. Oh, yeah. All right
[6865.24s -> 6872.85s]  Check this out
[6874.60s -> 6877.80s]  Where is it? Where is it?
[6882.20s -> 6895.11s]  There it is
[6895.19s -> 6902.42s]  Damn, damn
[6917.84s -> 6919.84s]  Jesus
[6923.64s -> 6938.98s]  So
[6958.42s -> 6960.42s]  I'm gonna try to finish that up. I was too scared
[6979.03s -> 6981.03s]  Gamer fatigue sets in
[7039.67s -> 7052.88s]  Oh, I could feel the fatigue fit, uh, just fitting onto me I didn't land
[7053.36s -> 7057.73s]  I think I only needed one of the bat move. They really did nerf that, huh?
[7058.29s -> 7060.45s]  That was a good match though
[7066.66s -> 7074.21s]  So the bat move has less, uh hit frames right stop drinking ethanol
[7076.52s -> 7078.52s]  I don't I don't do that
[7078.76s -> 7085.64s]  Spreading rumors. All right. I will change the announcer. I promise
[7092.29s -> 7096.96s]  Okay, i've got default announcer lebron has
[7103.54s -> 7110.74s]  I don't have enough coins a character choose a character who are you gonna send in who you're gonna play as
[7115.17s -> 7117.17s]  You must select your combatant
[7119.67s -> 7123.19s]  Oh, man, who are you gonna choose choose your fighter
[7124.07s -> 7127.83s]  Take your fighter pal. What are you gonna put in the ring?
[7129.22s -> 7132.98s]  Zoinks a lot of fighters to choose from man. That's definitely the best one
[7134.76s -> 7136.76s]  Choose your character
[7143.17s -> 7147.09s]  All right time to select your character. I was not ready for the laugh at the end of that
[7149.56s -> 7154.15s]  A lot of fighters to choose from man. Ah, it's jaggy. I don't have any coins
[7155.46s -> 7171.25s]  Do I get do I get whoa, hold on a second 250 gold. Hold on a second. Excuse me
[7174.71s -> 7176.71s]  All right, 70 win rate. That's pretty good
[7177.35s -> 7195.68s]  I'll take 70 percent. I have a premium token. Oh dude. I have one. I have one
[7196.64s -> 7208.61s]  Oh shit. All right. That means I get all the stuff. Oh I get okay. So I got a rain dog taunt
[7209.17s -> 7226.79s]  I got a taz skin. I already had tokens. Okay, cool. Happy fin hover taunt for superman. All right, let's do some teams
[7227.19s -> 7236.87s]  I'm just gonna mess around with teams. We'll close it out with teams. Yeah, so they're gonna be adding um
[7237.99s -> 7242.63s]  Black adam and stripe will be coming at some point soon during I think this season
[7242.95s -> 7254.80s]  I'm curious with how stripe stripe stripe is gonna be a bruiser. I'd imagine. All right, let's do some teams
[7257.76s -> 7264.00s]  Do I stick with gizmo or do I play with somebody else I feel like well, let's try the new skin. I mean, come on
[7266.47s -> 7280.26s]  Is taz any good anymore? I haven't really played with taz at all. You don't it's still taz
[7283.81s -> 7288.23s]  Well, yeah, because I don't have any currency. I don't have any uh in-game money
[7295.12s -> 7301.60s]  That's not gizmo. It's close enough. This is chad gizmo
[7311.92s -> 7316.18s]  Have any of you guys actually been really putting time into the game?
[7320.05s -> 7331.25s]  Who do you think is the best character in the game right now? Jake?
[7331.89s -> 7346.72s]  Is it gizmo gizmo feels really good. Oh, I caught them both
[7360.36s -> 7370.21s]  In aria. Oh, yeah, wait, you can do his sandwich more than a few times, right?
[7385.00s -> 7404.32s]  Oh

[7541.99s -> 7557.84s]  I was too busy putting it in my eyes. Remember to blink when you're in those, uh, deep gaming hours guys
