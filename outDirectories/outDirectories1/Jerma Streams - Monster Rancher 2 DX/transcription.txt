[88.06s -> 95.10s]  Is this game out yet? Is the game released yet? 430? No? Shit.
[95.10s -> 106.04s]  Where the fuck did this game come out? Real voice? What? What's wrong?
[106.04s -> 112.58s]  Maybe in 30 minutes? Alright, well what? Okay, so fuck.
[112.58s -> 120.73s]  Hey, first of all, hello. Hi everybody. How you doing? Good to see you again.
[120.73s -> 128.36s]  Today, plan is we're going to play Monster Rancher 2.
[128.36s -> 134.12s]  Trying to hold my excitement. This is one of my favorite games ever.
[134.12s -> 139.91s]  Fart on the mic. You got it. Why do so many people want streamers to fart in mics?
[141.82s -> 145.90s]  Is it funny? Oh, I saw a clip. I've completely forgot it. But let's talk about this real quick.
[146.79s -> 154.10s]  I completely forgot that. So during the dollhouse stream, there was a lot going on.
[154.10s -> 159.86s]  There was a lot of stuff that we recorded, right? Like the costume selection stuff, right? That was
[159.86s -> 165.54s]  all pre-recorded. And then there was stuff going on on the set. And my mind was not like watching
[165.54s -> 171.62s]  the stream and I completely forgot. And it took until I like, I like reminded of this like weird
[171.62s -> 176.50s]  thing where I spun around in the middle of the costume change scene and like do this like fake
[176.50s -> 183.90s]  spin fart loud into the microphone thing with my mouth. And I had a reaction to that like a few
[183.90s -> 190.66s]  months ago. Then I forgot about it. And I saw it like a few days ago. And I was like, I why is that
[191.06s -> 197.77s]  in the why is it here? I like didn't want that in the video. What is just there? I didn't want
[197.77s -> 207.59s]  that in the stream. But anyways, who cares? Let us see your face. I know I told you I'm sitting here
[207.59s -> 211.19s]  waiting for the release of Monster Rancher. And I'm gonna play Monster Rancher 2. And by the way,
[211.75s -> 219.62s]  who cares? I do. It was my fart for all the new germamites that are in attendance right now.
[221.48s -> 226.73s]  I played this game before. This is a re-release of the old PlayStation 1 games.
[228.26s -> 235.67s]  I can't I'm so excited. I can't wait to play. We be prepared to be more emotionally invested
[237.10s -> 247.34s]  in this than anything else you've ever done in your life with the microphone. No emotion for an
[247.34s -> 254.71s]  hour. I feel like I'm sitting in the line at Best Buy waiting for the new iPhone. I just want to
[254.71s -> 263.10s]  play. All right, hold on. Do I just do no emotion until the game comes out? Why did this turn into
[263.10s -> 269.34s]  like a weird like protest stream? I'm not I'm not like protesting the game. I know I'm I'm just
[269.34s -> 284.09s]  waiting for the game to come out. Turn on the cam and smoke cigarettes. I don't want to talk about
[284.09s -> 288.09s]  too much about the game because I want you to be surprised by how fun it is. Apparently the port's
[288.09s -> 294.09s]  pretty good too from what I've heard. It's almost 3am. Yeah, what time is it? When is it? Okay,
[294.09s -> 301.43s]  when is the next region midnight? Does anybody know? Like where is it 11.35 right now?
[304.76s -> 312.17s]  If you look at your clock and if it's 11.35 p.m. tell me where you are. What region? Ireland,
[312.17s -> 323.10s]  it's 12.35. Okay, so what is this? What is this release? It's 1am. 11.35 where? Oh, it's 11.35am.
[323.10s -> 330.78s]  That's not right. No, I'm talking general region. Region. It's 11.35am in Australia. I'm looking for
[330.78s -> 338.33s]  regions. It's not even out yet. I know. So look just fucking okay whatever. Ask ask me ask me
[338.33s -> 353.94s]  whatever you want. Okay, I'm fine. I'm sitting here till it comes out. Whole Europe is after zero zero.
[353.94s -> 371.48s]  You look unhealthy. Somebody said that. I did. I can I can I can stall as long as I want. Don't
[371.48s -> 376.76s]  you believe in time zones? I do believe in time. You know okay you're asking the guy if he believes
[376.76s -> 382.12s]  in time zones. The guy that has to respond to the EU viewers that yell at him because I stream too
[382.12s -> 394.68s]  late. You're talking to that guy. You don't think I know time zones? Seriously, what is this time?
[394.68s -> 399.53s]  I don't know. I'm waiting for Monster Rancher to come out. It probably doesn't even come out.
[402.63s -> 412.70s]  It's probably like an error on Steam that the game comes out like today. It says on Steam that the
[412.70s -> 418.79s]  game releases in less than an hour and that was an hour ago. That was at like that was at four o'clock.
[418.79s -> 437.27s]  What's your skincare routine? My eyes! You look you look greasy. Thanks. Oh you guys. Hey I'll
[437.27s -> 443.18s]  show you something interesting. I'll show you something interesting. Okay so this is my I had
[443.18s -> 449.58s]  to do this today. I had to put on a t-shirt. I had to put a shirt on today. Your tags are inaccurate.
[449.58s -> 461.29s]  What do you mean? No pants. Well no I do have pants on but this this is like the I'm in a zoom
[461.29s -> 466.41s]  call professional Andy. Just make sure uh just make sure you don't stand up so they see your
[466.41s -> 481.10s]  Darth Vader pajama pants. Look at this. Oh look. What's up guys? Yeah v-neck. I got a I got a cool
[481.10s -> 494.71s]  v-neck on. Don't stand up otherwise they'll know. You have one of the three shirts you own. I need
[494.71s -> 500.47s]  to go close. I look can I can let I have to talk about this. Listen to me. I need to know if anybody
[500.47s -> 511.03s]  else relates to this. So I have I have I don't like okay I own a shit load of really nice clothes
[511.03s -> 515.91s]  that I've purchased. I bought a bunch of clothing. I went to a bunch of nice places. Bought a bunch of
[515.91s -> 522.47s]  nice like tees. Really nice like button-up shirts and shit right. They are all wrinkled to fucking
[522.47s -> 526.63s]  hell in the closet. I have not worn them once because I don't want to mess them up. I don't
[526.63s -> 533.26s]  want to ruin them. I always feel like if I put my nice clothes on I have a bunch of it that I I will
[533.26s -> 539.38s]  somehow like sweat through it or drop mustard on it or something. I never want to wear those clothes.
[539.38s -> 546.82s]  I don't know why and they they seriously look like they look like they're in a vacuum sealed
[546.82s -> 550.98s]  bag because of how fucked up and scrunched and wrinkled they are. I don't think any dry
[550.98s -> 556.71s]  cleaning would work. I think I literally have to get new clothes because they're so wrinkled up.
[556.71s -> 563.38s]  This is not going to happen. I tried to iron one of them once and all it did was make make like
[563.38s -> 572.22s]  a bunch of lines and it was bad. In the pre-stream you promised Mario Golf. I was shit faced when I
[572.22s -> 583.43s]  promised Mario Golf like six months ago. So sorry. What'd you say? Don't eat mustard then. How often
[583.43s -> 588.23s]  are you eating mustard? Are you wearing really nice clothes to a ball game? No I don't know. I
[588.23s -> 594.71s]  always just feel like okay I feel like I sweat a lot and like I'm gonna get those like orange stains
[594.71s -> 602.81s]  under the nice clothes. What causes those orange stains by the way? It doesn't happen to me but if
[602.81s -> 616.39s]  it did what is why does that happen? Game out yet? I'm in the wrong category too. Yeah I gotta move
[616.39s -> 623.05s]  to like just chatting for like 20 minutes or wait is it is it technically a Monster Rancher 2 stream
[623.05s -> 628.34s]  if I'm talking about how pumped and hyped I am for Monster Rancher 2? You look red. I know
[629.34s -> 642.42s]  I'm very flustered. Why is you sweat orange? No it's after when it dries. It's aluminum.
[642.42s -> 651.06s]  It's an allergic reaction huh. Derma you still owe me four million dollars for stealing and
[651.06s -> 660.50s]  crashing my jetpack. Jetpacks aren't real. Why do you look so nice today? Who did you kill for the
[660.50s -> 679.05s]  youth today? I shaved. So I killed the millions of tiny little hairs that were on my face I'd say.
[679.05s -> 688.82s]  You look 15 years young. Guess I shaved my face. This is a fresh shave. How come you're de-aging?
[688.82s -> 696.68s]  I'm not de-aging. I'm this is just what my face looks like after I shave. I could use a haircut
[696.68s -> 705.58s]  too. Your face looks red. I know because my white balance is wrong and it's like I'm a little warm.
[705.58s -> 711.50s]  My white balance is screwed up. This wall this wall is not like green okay. It's it's like white.
[711.50s -> 727.30s]  It's kind of like a off-white. This chat's going too fast. What's on the reddit shelf?
[728.23s -> 734.50s]  Uh on the reddit shelf we have I've kind of been doing a little collection here so I'll move this
[734.50s -> 741.80s]  way. Uh every major stream people have maybe been paying attention to this but every major stream a
[741.80s -> 746.98s]  prop like a little piece of it goes up there and eventually I wanted to get to the point where
[747.86s -> 754.23s]  all those Funko pops get removed. I'm gonna start replacing the Funko pops with like one little prop
[754.23s -> 761.80s]  from a major stream. So hopefully over the next year or two that shelf is fucking overflowing.
[761.80s -> 766.70s]  It's like it's a nice I don't know it's a nice little reminder like walk in and be like oh yeah
[766.70s -> 769.34s]  that one that one that was fun that was fun that was fun that was fun.
[769.34s -> 778.60s]  The geodes there yeah most of them all the major streams the big event streams are up there with
[778.60s -> 787.93s]  the exception of maybe maybe I don't know maybe one. He's holding on to the past. No I would be
[787.93s -> 795.13s]  holding on to the past if this was like 30 years from now and I come in and I pick up the 985 plaque
[795.13s -> 811.05s]  and I'm like oh I remember when I did that oh it's it happened like six months ago. Remember when
[811.05s -> 818.14s]  what was your favorite stream? I don't have a favorite. Game out yet? No. You need to get the
[818.14s -> 824.49s]  Deathwing Funko pop. Why would I do that? I don't give a shit about that game. I don't care at all
[824.49s -> 832.44s]  about Deathwing. Why would I ever get the Deathwing Funko pop? I haven't played World of Warcraft
[832.44s -> 841.85s]  since I swore off of it like six years ago when you watched the Meltdown stream. What did you say?
[841.85s -> 855.61s]  Do a cool camera effect. No I we have 15 minutes before I can I hope it unlocks. Okay this is like
[855.69s -> 861.42s]  me waiting for the iPhone at Best Buy except Best Buy didn't tell me didn't say anything about
[861.42s -> 867.83s]  what time the iPhone was coming out. I'm just here. Excuse me sir we never we didn't like tell
[867.83s -> 871.67s]  you that like the game was the the iPhone was going to be out today. Yeah I'm just here I'm
[871.67s -> 878.94s]  gonna wait for it. What if it's like three weeks from now? Yeah that's that's fine I'll just like
[878.94s -> 887.32s]  I'll just hang out. Well how do you like McDonald's? I love McDonald's. Remember how's TikTok treating
[887.32s -> 911.06s]  you? You tell me. What's my favorite bug? Praying mantis probably. Yeah we're doing the game awards
[911.06s -> 920.98s]  tomorrow. Absolutely. That's also at 4 30. Hopefully that actually starts at 4 30. Do I have any
[920.98s -> 928.30s]  vinyls? No I don't have any vinyls. And what hold on what's what's going on here? I need to make
[928.30s -> 937.45s]  sure something here. Should I just switch to just chatting like I'm just sitting here? I'm not going
[937.45s -> 946.54s]  to sit in the wrong category for like fucking an hour. Don't no more swearing either. Just chatting
[946.54s -> 955.54s]  return to the farm. Whatever that means. I swear to god if I change category and it comes out in
[955.54s -> 962.39s]  two minutes I'm gonna be mad. Now all right if it doesn't come out at five then I will just leave
[962.39s -> 978.26s]  this category. If it isn't ready can you play the Manos hands of fate game? No no thank you. Do
[978.26s -> 985.88s]  something wacky? Um I don't think these pants will allow me to do that. I could give you a TikTok
[985.88s -> 994.33s]  though. You want to talk about world's greatest TikToker? Yeah I could prove it to you. Can I
[994.33s -> 999.91s]  stand up? This is not inappropriate right? There's a pair of pants with I have underwear on. Why do
[999.91s -> 1005.59s]  you have to ask that? Why do I have to even say that? I sometimes forget how many people I'm
[1005.59s -> 1010.38s]  talking to. My mother's pissed probably. She's probably like Jeremy. I just heard my mother's
[1010.38s -> 1020.54s]  voice go Jeremy. TikTok fine. You want to see the next fucking big TikTok dance? I'll give it to you
[1020.54s -> 1029.86s]  right now. All right fine. Okay I've trended on TikTok three different times in the last fucking
[1029.86s -> 1042.39s]  three years. Bring this one to the fucking front page. Oh this one the goddamn orangutan. See on
[1042.39s -> 1064.66s]  the front page. Holy shit it's already gone viral. It's already viral. I didn't even do it. I just
[1064.66s -> 1077.64s]  did that for five seconds. You think I could be on TikTok.com? What the fuck did that guy do?
[1077.64s -> 1087.32s]  That's the latest TikTok craze. It's called the orangutan. You keep talking just make it already.
[1087.88s -> 1104.90s]  I'm not gonna make a TikTok. Jerma I would, Jerma I would rather see you in the hospital
[1104.90s -> 1123.21s]  than on TikTok. Holy shit dude. What the fuck? Can you be toxic? Sure fine. No I don't do that.
[1123.21s -> 1138.01s]  I'm too excited. By the way, important, the New Year's Eve nominations are still open.
[1138.01s -> 1145.37s]  Still open. If you have something this year that you thought was really awful or really cool,
[1145.37s -> 1156.49s]  go to the Discord. I'm winded from doing the, it's a tough dance. We've got 10 minutes until I have
[1156.49s -> 1165.18s]  to panic and figure out what the hell I'm gonna do for the next few hours. Be funny. I just did
[1165.18s -> 1181.70s]  the orangutan and that was fucking hilarious. Don't you remember? This is why I shouldn't
[1181.70s -> 1186.54s]  ever fucking go live unless I exactly am ready to stream the game. You guys that's why I don't
[1186.54s -> 1191.86s]  do like IRL is because I can't be trusted with anything. That was trendy but it wasn't funny.
[1197.00s -> 1204.04s]  That was trendy. Why am I so red? Why? Dude I don't understand. Why do I have so much blood in my skin?
[1205.54s -> 1216.06s]  Why am I like this? I don't think I really am though. Does that mean I have too much blood
[1216.06s -> 1223.10s]  all over my whole face and shit? What does that mean? You're regressing to 2011 Jerma. Yeah the
[1223.10s -> 1232.86s]  Jerma that was red in every video. But I was burnt. That was burnt. I don't know why I decided
[1232.86s -> 1242.82s]  to turn the face cam on and do videos when I was just burnt every time. Was it? We've seen the
[1242.82s -> 1255.05s]  orangutan but can we see the... I don't know what that is. You're very sweaty. I'm not, I'm real,
[1255.05s -> 1268.81s]  I'm not though. I'm just red. Nine minutes. Nine minutes. Remain. Why is your bed on the floor
[1268.81s -> 1276.71s]  behind you? That's a dog bed. Or that could be very far away, right? What if I just freaked everybody
[1276.71s -> 1281.19s]  out right now and I got up and I started running and walking towards that and I started getting
[1281.19s -> 1288.63s]  smaller and like five minutes later I get in that bed and lie in it like I'm this big. That would
[1288.63s -> 1298.82s]  have been hilarious. Jerma it comes out tomorrow but look at Steam. I'm telling you look at Steam
[1298.82s -> 1308.70s]  says the game releases in less than an hour. It said 23 hours an hour ago. This is not copium.
[1308.70s -> 1323.19s]  This is factual information on the Steam website. It's gonna be five. I think so. You're already
[1323.19s -> 1327.46s]  fitting that perfectly. I, I gotta fix this. I don't know why I'm so red. I'm like, I'm like
[1327.46s -> 1340.82s]  turning purple. Am I or is that just my shitty monitor? I can't, I have no idea. You're bruising
[1340.82s -> 1348.70s]  because your lights are too blue. Let me, let me see what I can do. Hold on. Bear with me here.
[1348.70s -> 1369.66s]  Okay. White balance. Let's change it. Oh there we go. I'm actually like blue now. I don't, why am I,
[1369.66s -> 1378.89s]  I don't, do I even have human skin? Why is it like so hard for me to white balance my face?
[1378.89s -> 1389.02s]  I don't get it. I promise I'm not like this like red and purple. I've made like videos on
[1389.18s -> 1396.70s]  TikTok before. I'm not this red and purple. Why do I have so much blood? I don't know.
[1396.70s -> 1410.74s]  I don't know. Six minutes until we don't get to play the game. He's so scary. I'm,
[1410.74s -> 1414.02s]  all right, give me some questions. This is supposed to be an ask me anything before Monster,
[1414.02s -> 1418.74s]  ask me anything about Monster Rancher. How does that sound? Because this is a Monster Rancher 2
[1418.74s -> 1430.38s]  stream. What does your mouth look like an optical illusion image? Like the ones with Obama where
[1430.38s -> 1437.13s]  one version's facial features are upside down. I don't know. My cells split like differently in
[1437.13s -> 1444.62s]  the womb. I don't know. I have no idea what you mean. That was actually kind of funny.
[1444.62s -> 1450.06s]  All right, what'd you say? You're still going to play the Monster Breeder? Yes.
[1453.26s -> 1460.42s]  You like Ranch? Not really. It's okay. How old were you when you first played Monster Rancher?
[1460.42s -> 1471.70s]  Now that is a good question. I believe I was 13, 14, PlayStation 1. I loved it. They replaced
[1471.70s -> 1478.95s]  the CD system. I am not going to give a judgment on it until I play it in approximately five minutes.
[1478.95s -> 1491.06s]  What are your thoughts on Honey Mustard? I love it. Why do you look like that? Why do you, why do
[1491.06s -> 1508.84s]  you look like that? Is this 2D or 3D? It's 3D. Why is your face red in Monster Rancher? When was the
[1508.84s -> 1520.36s]  last time that you touched grass with your fingertips? Does soil count? Like does dirt count?
[1520.36s -> 1529.14s]  Because I've done a bunch of stuff with plants over the last like few months. That should count.
[1529.14s -> 1542.73s]  Four minutes. When I drink that's a nice coffee. What'd you say? Why did I see you blink like a
[1542.73s -> 1549.42s]  reptile two minutes ago? I don't know. I'm really blinky. I'm really blinky and I lick my lips all
[1549.42s -> 1558.87s]  the time. So maybe I am a lizard. I don't know. Your straw is longer than your forearm. Holy shit.
[1558.87s -> 1569.59s]  This is huge. This is, this is huge. Why is this so huge? Oh my god. How are you, why are you so
[1569.59s -> 1581.56s]  perceptive? What? It's, it is fucking gigantic. What? This is probably for like a 40 ounce drink.
[1581.56s -> 1584.84s]  I actually, I'm really happy about it though because I don't have to like move. I can just
[1584.84s -> 1592.14s]  go like this. Takes too long to get to your mouth. No it doesn't. Perpetual
[1592.52s -> 1603.00s]  kinetic energy gets it there faster. Am I, I'm not even that red. It's just a shitty monitor.
[1603.00s -> 1615.98s]  How many people are in here? There's like almost 12,000 people here. Is it out? Your straw is as
[1615.98s -> 1630.31s]  long as an oil pipeline. Play a game already. I'm so, I hope this releases in three minutes.
[1630.31s -> 1642.07s]  Please release in three minutes. What'd you say? Are you hip with the kids? Talk to me in an hour
[1642.07s -> 1646.23s]  when the orangutan is trending on the front page of the app where you cannot be over the age of 35
[1646.23s -> 1676.74s]  to use it. That's an ego, egotistical. What the? This monitor is, you know what? It is this monitor.
[1676.74s -> 1682.39s]  Remember when I thought that like a green like vegetable was gray or something? Because this
[1682.39s -> 1700.46s]  monitor's colors are all screwed up. Two minutes! Yo dude, where's my door dash order? I don't know.
[1704.94s -> 1719.29s]  Why would I know that? There's a bug on my face. Good. Okay. 60 seconds, come on! Come on, come on,
[1720.09s -> 1724.89s]  Monster Rancher. Monster Rancher 2. If we all say it collectively at the same time,
[1724.89s -> 1732.89s]  it's going to happen. Ready? Monster Rancher 2. Monster Rancher 2. Monster Rancher 2. Monster

[1739.54s -> 1748.28s]  Monster Rancher 2. Monster Rancher 2. I feel like I'm at a camp. I feel as enthusiastic. Monster
[1748.28s -> 1769.83s]  Rancher 2. Monster Rancher 2. Monster, come on! This game will, it just says coming soon now.
[1769.83s -> 1797.51s]  That's, wait, that's normal? It's normal? Somebody said that's normal. Does that mean it's like about
[1797.51s -> 1813.24s]  to come out? Like right now? Restart Steam. Is it out? It's out? Restart Steam. All right,
[1813.24s -> 1841.37s]  I'm gonna restart Steam. Oh shit, it's out. This deserves an orang attack! It's not even out! Where
[1841.37s -> 1857.00s]  is it? I just, are you lying to me? Come on, it's out! Install it already. Somebody says yikes.
[1859.59s -> 1874.17s]  No, it's out. It's out. It's out. Come on. Holy shit, I can't wait. Fucking install it!
[1874.17s -> 1890.33s]  Hurry up and install it! Come on! Dude, you need to chill. Yeah, I know. Dude, the iPhone just came
[1890.33s -> 1903.78s]  out. The iPhone just came out and I'm in line to get the iPhone. Are you on meth? That's fucking
[1903.78s -> 1908.84s]  funny. We did a drug test like a year or two ago and the only thing that came up was cocaine. So
[1908.84s -> 1919.21s]  like, I mean, that person's fucking wrong. Why can't, come on, download. Wait a minute, hold on a
[1919.21s -> 1934.15s]  second. Why is this fucked up? Shit. All right, hold on. I'm restarting it again. I don't do
[1934.15s -> 1940.46s]  fucking drugs, guys. Marijuana is the only thing I've ever done. I drink alcohol like six times a
[1940.46s -> 1955.86s]  year. Come on. Is it installing? Oh dude, here it goes. All right, my stream might crash because I
[1955.86s -> 1960.12s]  can't like do two things at once. I might be downloading too fast. Let's see, tell me if the
[1960.12s -> 1975.08s]  stream crashes. I can't wait. I'm so happy. I get to play Monster Rancher 2. Monster Rancher 2.
[1975.24s -> 1986.22s]  Monster Rancher 2. How do my headphones in? All right, open it. Turn the volume down in case it's
[1986.22s -> 1998.65s]  too loud. I'm opening it for the first time. It actually is out. It was really loud. Can you hear
[1998.65s -> 2011.48s]  this? That's so loud. I got scared. Turn this, turn it down. There's no audio for you. Okay, well,
[2011.48s -> 2017.42s]  there is now. I'm sorry. I just made it loud for you. That was my fault. All right, Monster Rancher
[2017.42s -> 2029.16s]  2. Monster. This is, I got to go to the options here. Sound on. What is it? FF. FF? Resolution
[2029.16s -> 2047.19s]  settings. Here we go. I want a full screen. Full screen. Oh shit, I didn't have a controller. Okay,
[2047.19s -> 2060.81s]  I got a controller. Stop. Let's chill. Gonna fucking hang out. Play Monster Rancher 2. It's a
[2060.81s -> 2066.82s]  fucking pretty fun game, dude. Minimize the face cam. I have to make sure the game works first.
[2067.38s -> 2075.35s]  Why can't this? Full screen. I want it full screen. I don't know what FF is, but I'm just gonna say
[2075.35s -> 2086.02s]  okay. Confirm. I don't think that did anything. Oh Jesus, I don't know what's going on. Okay,
[2086.02s -> 2091.53s]  hold on. Let me capture it. Oh shit, this is, I can't wait. This is fucking unbelievable.
[2094.86s -> 2115.77s]  All right, so listen to me. I can't fucking wait, dude. There it is. I just looked so pretend
[2115.77s -> 2129.70s]  interesting. I'll do face cam for 10 minutes and it's never going on ever again. What happened
[2129.70s -> 2143.29s]  to my hair? Why does my hair look so like fluffy and weird? Okay, here we go. So if you guys don't
[2143.29s -> 2146.89s]  know anything about Monster Rancher, let's talk about it very, very quickly, very briefly.
[2148.12s -> 2156.94s]  Monster Rancher, where'd it go? Where'd it go? Why isn't it being captured? What just happened?
[2156.94s -> 2178.92s]  What the fuck is going on? What happened? Why is it doing this? All right, I want to do new game.
[2179.64s -> 2199.64s]  Why is this not showing up? It was just, you guys just saw it, right? There it is. You ready?
[2200.44s -> 2207.48s]  Monster Rancher is a monster training and battle simulation game. This game takes place over the
[2207.48s -> 2212.52s]  course of a few years, I think five to 10 years on your ranch. And what happens is you get these
[2212.52s -> 2219.16s]  monsters, you can breed them and you fight in battles. And it's way better than Pokemon. Okay,
[2219.16s -> 2227.43s]  Pokemon is not even close. Neither is digital monsters either. So what's going to happen here
[2227.43s -> 2235.85s]  is I'm going to get into the game. I'm so fucking excited. Let's go. Please sign your name here.
[2238.71s -> 2242.55s]  No, matches are open to public view. Do not include any personal info or offensive
[2242.55s -> 2255.85s]  wording. Some words made up. Wait, there's online in this? Holy shit, really? All right, what's my
[2255.85s -> 2269.21s]  name? What should it be? I don't have to hurry up. Dean Baxon. This is not the name of my monster.
[2269.21s -> 2285.53s]  This is the trainer. I feel like there's a significant amount of lag. Okay, this is important.
[2285.53s -> 2298.74s]  How about Jaxxus Cole? Sus guy is not going up there. The orangutan. No, there are orangutans in
[2298.74s -> 2304.34s]  the game though. A lot of you new viewers, I have no idea just how fucking cool this game is. I'm
[2304.34s -> 2309.22s]  able to change your whole life. We've played this before a few years ago. It's one of my favorite
[2309.22s -> 2314.42s]  games. You're about to experience one of the coolest fucking games ever made. And I'm dead
[2314.42s -> 2330.17s]  serious about that. Pay attention. All right, it's just Jeremy. Jeremy. No, Jaxx is fine.
[2330.17s -> 2344.20s]  Why is it X? What's with the X? How do I? That's interesting. Should I use the keyboard and mouse?
[2344.68s -> 2360.49s]  That's the wrong X. How is it wrong? Jaxx, you will be a new trainer, right? We're going to have to
[2360.49s -> 2368.15s]  take, you're gonna have to learn and type the test. Please answer these questions. I have never lied
[2368.15s -> 2378.49s]  in my entire life. Uh, I have, I lie all the time. The effort I put forth in reaching my goal is more
[2378.49s -> 2390.39s]  important than the outcome. That depends. That depends. I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, can I just,
[2390.47s -> 2398.82s]  can I click the thing in the middle? I'm gonna say yes. My dream can be realized as long as I do my
[2398.82s -> 2409.32s]  best to achieve it, but also luck at like right place, right time. And yeah, I don't know. I gotta,
[2409.32s -> 2429.53s]  I gotta click the one in the middle. It's 90% luck. You're a millionaire. Just say yes. If I have to
[2429.53s -> 2437.70s]  choose, I like spring better than winter. No way, dude. Before I start proceeding with something,
[2437.70s -> 2451.27s]  I should make sure it's safe. But it's safe how? Like safe physical danger or safe like out of my
[2451.27s -> 2463.53s]  comfort zone. I'm gonna say no. In a battle, what counts in the end is mental power. Um, unless the
[2463.53s -> 2482.71s]  person has a gun. When I'm ordered to do something I like, I'm confused. What does that mean? When
[2482.71s -> 2491.85s]  I'm ordered to do something I like, I'm confused. I don't think, I don't think so. I, I think it's
[2491.85s -> 2495.91s]  like that. I'm like surprised. Like, oh, this is cool. If someone does something displeasing,
[2495.91s -> 2502.34s]  I should not behave the same way. Yeah, I'm not, if somebody's doing something doesn't mean you do
[2502.34s -> 2513.93s]  it. When I am absorbed in something, I don't notice what's going on around me. Yes. In order
[2513.93s -> 2520.38s]  to truly succeed, sometimes I need to make a risky choice. Yes, absolutely. But have backup
[2520.38s -> 2535.53s]  plans. That's all, thank you very much. Please wait here for a while. I'm, I can't fucking wait,
[2535.53s -> 2541.74s]  dude. You guys have no idea how fun this game is. Hello Jax, thank you for waiting. I was explaining
[2541.74s -> 2549.96s]  the type of trainer you are to the trainer assistant. Uh, I am a trainer assistant. Oh yeah,
[2549.96s -> 2561.66s]  okay. I remember the exam pass date, the exam score a little bit hasty. Okay. This is the trainer.
[2561.66s -> 2568.78s]  This is the trainer that I have for help. She is the trainer assistant who is going to your place.
[2568.78s -> 2581.94s]  She is still a bit childish, but she sure is a good girl. Here she is. Coltia. How do you do Jax?
[2581.94s -> 2591.22s]  I'm Coltia. Please call me Colt. You're going to work with her for quite some time.
[2591.22s -> 2598.81s]  So please try to get along with each other. Do your best to raise a monster well so that it can
[2598.81s -> 2608.46s]  win the major four. Way better than Pokemon. I'm looking forward to your performance. That's my
[2608.46s -> 2614.26s]  opinion, right? My opinion is that I think this is better than Poke, Pokemon. That's my opinion.
[2614.26s -> 2617.14s]  You might have a different opinion. Your opinion could be different than mine and that's okay.
[2621.93s -> 2628.57s]  Yes, sir. Well, Jax, let's do our best. First, you should obtain a monster at the market in the
[2628.57s -> 2636.97s]  town or at the shrine by generating it from a disk stone or a slate and then take it with you
[2636.97s -> 2645.19s]  to the ranch. How this game worked back in the day is there was a certain code that was embedded
[2645.19s -> 2650.98s]  onto every CD and DVD that you owned and it would pull a random piece of data from that. For instance,
[2650.98s -> 2657.13s]  I put Adam Sandler's Click in when we played this a few years ago and you get a specific monster to
[2657.13s -> 2664.04s]  that disk. Obviously now CDs don't exist anymore, so I don't know what the hell they're going to do.
[2664.04s -> 2668.04s]  I guess now there's like a gigantic database where you can look up your favorite songs and
[2668.04s -> 2675.27s]  movies or something. I don't know. I wonder how it works. We'll find out. But it was really fun
[2675.27s -> 2683.99s]  because I got like 40 just random CDs and DVDs and we just generated monsters and the monster
[2683.99s -> 2688.12s]  will always be the same for that disk. It can be a million different combinations, although it's
[2688.12s -> 2700.73s]  probably like way less than that, but it's a lot. Thank you. Did you see that information there?
[2700.73s -> 2707.34s]  I'm still a rookie here and Jax, you too have just become a trainer, right? Is there anything
[2707.34s -> 2718.94s]  you would like to ask about? I know everything there is to know. I've already played this game.
[2718.94s -> 2725.37s]  Are you done? Yes. And let's go find our monster. We're going to get a default monster. We're going
[2725.37s -> 2731.30s]  to get our Squirtle. We're going to get our Charizard or one of the plant stones back.
[2731.30s -> 2740.26s]  So wait, should we go to the shrine? Excuse me. Is this your first time visiting the shrine?
[2740.26s -> 2750.52s]  What's your name? My name is Colt. This is Jax, a trainer. I am Chally, a priestess of the shrine.
[2750.52s -> 2757.59s]  We generate monsters using disk stones and slates, backup data of Monster Rancher. So this is like
[2757.59s -> 2767.22s]  save game and stuff, right? What do you want to generate? A disk? How does this work? Disk stone?
[2767.22s -> 2778.74s]  Uh, I wonder how this works. The music is... I'm so excited. I am too. Here comes DMC. I don't...
[2778.74s -> 2786.36s]  No, hold on. Where is it? I don't think it actually plays the music. It definitely doesn't play the
[2786.36s -> 2796.98s]  music. Oh shit. What am I doing? How can we get... Wait, what did I do? Oh, okay. So what should I look
[2796.98s -> 2809.51s]  up? Oops. The title of the song or an artist? Cautions? All right, how about just something
[2809.51s -> 2825.40s]  simple? Okay. How about Crazy Frog? Does that exist? There's no search result. Please change
[2825.40s -> 2843.34s]  the conditions. There is no crazy frog. Toxic. Uh, toxic by 30 forever... There are toxic by
[2843.34s -> 2854.84s]  Britney Spears. Okay. Are we ready? What do we get from toxic by Britney Spears? I regret to tell you
[2854.84s -> 2864.34s]  that this rare monster can be generated only by an authorized trainer. Please come again. Remember
[2864.34s -> 2881.58s]  that for later. This is a rare monster. Okay. Well, let's try again. Thumbnails. Elvis? What
[2881.58s -> 2896.97s]  do they have for Elvis? Elvis Costa? No, no. Where's Elvis Elvis? Where's Elvis Elvis? Elvis...
[2896.97s -> 2904.55s]  Okay. There's Elvis Elvis. How about a little less conversation, a little more action? I think that
[2904.55s -> 2915.43s]  one. A little less conversation. Elvis versus J-X-L. Okay. Let's see what we get. Here is the big
[2915.43s -> 2943.99s]  moment. Are you ready? It's a brown dinosaur. What is it? Strong looking monster. Why is it so tired?
[2943.99s -> 2952.18s]  Looks dependable. Okay. Do you want to take this monster to your ranch? All right. This shit's
[2952.18s -> 2959.75s]  really important. That's not bad. High skill. Intelligence is awful. Power is not that great,
[2959.75s -> 2975.24s]  but life and skill are really high. I think we can have a bunch. I'm going to take it. Can I take it?
[2975.32s -> 2981.30s]  There's a hundred gifted subs. Who gave a hundred gifted subs? What? I just, how did I miss that?
[2984.23s -> 2993.78s]  Soveen 4500 fucking community subs. What are you doing? Thank you, Soveen. The a hundred community
[2993.78s -> 3002.94s]  subs. Finally noticed. Speed is horrible. From what I remember, intelligence and power are the
[3002.94s -> 3009.45s]  important ones. Intelligence, power, and life. Which is the one that replenishes guts? Guts is
[3009.45s -> 3018.12s]  like mana, but thanks. That's an insane amount of money. That's never, never necessary. Never
[3018.12s -> 3026.06s]  expected. It's crazy. Thanks for the insane amount of subs. Name this Alvin. We'll remember
[3026.06s -> 3033.77s]  because they don't change. We'll remember. So I'm not going to take this one. Elvis, a little less
[3033.77s -> 3047.85s]  conversation, a little more. All right. Let's try it again. How about Kevin McCloud? Definitely not
[3047.85s -> 3063.19s]  here. Is it, how is it? Is it Mac? Like that? Damn it. Oh, Freddie Dredd. Let's see it.
[3063.19s -> 3071.46s]  It'd be Freddie Dredd. Spelt it wrong. If there's a Freddie Dredd on here, I'm going to have to do
[3071.46s -> 3084.18s]  it. Is it two D's? What is it? I'm spelling wrong. Is it two D's or is it A? No, it's two D's,
[3084.18s -> 3102.55s]  right? That's not, it's not like that. Or what if I do that? About a hundred gecks. Not here. I think
[3102.55s -> 3108.09s]  it's based on, from like 1999 or something. This is not like, I think this is actually pulled from
[3108.09s -> 3120.47s]  like the CDs that were available. Weezer? Okay. Weezer. Which Weezer album? I've done, I don't
[3120.47s -> 3131.99s]  know what any of these albums are. How about Christmas with Weezer? Sounds good to me. I regret
[3131.99s -> 3145.18s]  to tell you it's too rare. All right, whatever. What's on the market? Radiohead? Yeah, you can
[3145.18s -> 3151.66s]  buy Monsters 2. So Monsters have two different types. There's the main type and the subtype.
[3151.66s -> 3158.74s]  And pretty much all Monsters can be combined. So if you have like a Dino type and a Bug type,
[3158.74s -> 3165.54s]  they can be combined. Sometimes it can just be Dino, Dino, right? Which is just, just Dino.
[3165.54s -> 3173.10s]  Or you can combine Monsters 2. So I think everything in the market is just a straight,
[3173.10s -> 3183.13s]  just straight up like Dino or like Ivysaur. Whatever, right? Okay. Let me see. They, oh,
[3183.13s -> 3189.59s]  they buy Monsters from you too. I forgot about that. Let me see what's in the, in the market.
[3189.59s -> 3196.54s]  So we know what we're looking for. Let's see. What do you got? Please choose. So that we had,
[3196.54s -> 3210.87s]  this is a regular just Dino. Choose a Monster you like. Okay. Zoom? Suezo? Or a Mochi? What's the
[3210.87s -> 3216.49s]  Dino's, the Zoom? All right. That's actually kind of, is that better than the one that we found?
[3216.49s -> 3232.52s]  This one's actually a little better. It's way better. Typing the talking heads. All right.
[3232.52s -> 3236.97s]  Let's go over these so people know what's going on. Life is just your health. Power is physical
[3236.97s -> 3243.54s]  damage. Intelligence is magic. Like tech damage. It's green. Skill, I don't remember. Speed,
[3243.54s -> 3249.62s]  I don't remember. And defense is how, you know, damage reduction. I forget what skill and speed
[3249.62s -> 3256.17s]  actually do. Speed I think actually is your, that's regeneration? Skill is accuracy. Speed is turn
[3256.17s -> 3260.97s]  order. There you go. Skill is hit chance. Speed is evade chance. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[3260.97s -> 3273.02s]  I don't want this one. Let's go back. I know the music is like a cartoon clown one. I know.
[3273.02s -> 3279.51s]  The actual game of Monster Rancher. Just wait till we get to it. Holy shit. It's one of the best
[3279.51s -> 3284.04s]  games ever made. I, you know, I'm just, I'm going to, I'm going to drag this out for like the next
[3284.04s -> 3293.30s]  two weeks. Hope you guys are ready. All right. What'd you, who, who should I do? Frank Sinatra?
[3298.23s -> 3338.60s]  What? Frank Sinatra? Talking heads. Okay. That's not here either. In sync. What? Nirvana. Okay.
[3338.60s -> 3359.75s]  Nirvana. Which one? MTV Unplugged in New York. Which one should I do? MTV Unplugged in New York.
[3359.75s -> 3373.30s]  I guess we're just going to do this one. Here we go. The unplugged album is actually good as hell.
[3374.49s -> 3386.20s]  All right. All right. So this is a, like a Triceratops thing. It's very small. Holy shit.
[3386.20s -> 3405.67s]  That skill though. Life is bad, but that skill, that base skill is huge. The life is bad. I'm
[3405.67s -> 3425.11s]  taking it. You have to give it a name. What will the name be? All fours Barney. Barney all fours.
[3445.18s -> 3461.58s]  Gumbo? It's Barney. What a, I'm crawling. Barney Sanders? I like Barney. All right. Hold on.
[3462.92s -> 3478.70s]  Barney. How about just Barney? I like Barney. How about Barney fours? I like Barney fours.
[3478.94s -> 3503.82s]  What about Kurt? It could be Kurt. I like Barney though. This is just the first one. I like Barney
[3503.82s -> 3511.48s]  fours. It sounds like kind of like Barney rubble, but not at all. I like Barney fours. All right.
[3511.48s -> 3523.35s]  Here we go. All right. This is an auto save feature. That's amazing. So let's go back to the ranch
[3523.91s -> 3531.74s]  and let, I'm at, the controller's not really, this is where the game begins. You can get a ton more.
[3531.74s -> 3538.42s]  Yeah, absolutely. The whole point of Monster Rancher is you train them and get their stats up
[3538.42s -> 3545.14s]  and they, before they die, you freeze them and then you get another monster up, a shitload,
[3545.94s -> 3549.54s]  and then you freeze that one and then you combine them and you get something else.
[3549.54s -> 3564.46s]  They can die. Yep. Which food do you want to give it this month? Okay. How much? I have 5,000 gold.
[3564.46s -> 3571.22s]  Uh, though most monsters don't like such animal foods, a few do. Nutritious Milk? I don't know
[3571.22s -> 3583.45s]  what, what he, what he likes. I remember the strat was like tablets are insane, right? I don't
[3583.45s -> 3595.02s]  know what he likes. Do milk. He's a baby. Yeah. So the, the way this game works is there's a hidden
[3595.02s -> 3603.03s]  stress and a hidden fatigue meter. The higher your stress and fatigue are, the more life is taken
[3603.03s -> 3610.06s]  off of you at the end of your life. So if this monster base monster value lives for two years,
[3610.06s -> 3615.32s]  if you keep your stress and fatigue high, it's just like chain smoking cigarettes. You just all,
[3615.32s -> 3620.74s]  you're just losing life at the end of your life. So you have to try to manage their kind of hidden
[3620.74s -> 3629.74s]  stress meter. Cup of jelly reduces stress from what I remember. Tablets just are, they're expensive,
[3629.74s -> 3636.15s]  but they just taste gross. They don't, they don't like it, but it makes them train better.
[3636.15s -> 3646.42s]  I don't know if I go right into, um, tablets and they, they like certain foods too. We'll do jelly.
[3646.42s -> 3655.59s]  Jelly is usually pretty good pick. Or milk. I'll do milk. Do you want to give milk? Yes.
[3655.59s -> 3671.50s]  Here, eat. You like it? Yes. Who is it? Oh, quote, long time no see. Master Pabs. Nice to see you.
[3671.50s -> 3678.68s]  Jax, this is master Pabs. Jax, I am Pabs. Nice to see you. He was the greatest trainer ever.
[3678.68s -> 3685.66s]  Stop it, Colt. Oh, they can run away too. So we have to be careful. Jax, keep up with the good work,
[3685.66s -> 3693.64s]  Colt. I have to go now. I have an appointment. Master Pabs used to be the number one trainer
[3693.64s -> 3704.52s]  among IMA. He's not running. He's fine. I know he doesn't look like that. Bonnie. I hate this.
[3704.52s -> 3719.37s]  Bonnie four is very well. All right. I'm curious. File. Where is it? Monster data. Okay. Here we go.
[3719.37s -> 3729.54s]  All right. So Ari. Why are you giving me so much money? 75 more subs from Ari. Why are you giving
[3729.54s -> 3737.69s]  me so much money? This is insane. Thank you. That's a lot of money. All right. I need to see more.
[3737.69s -> 3746.71s]  This is the win loss record style even. Okay. Likes meat does not like cup jelly. So if we
[3746.71s -> 3753.02s]  feed this character cup jelly, it's going to be pissed and it's going to increase their stress
[3753.02s -> 3759.43s]  and reduce their life. Not their HP, their actual how long they get to live. So we got to be careful.
[3759.43s -> 3769.90s]  It's a lot of money. All right. Uh, bad natured likes meat as these two moves scratch and bite.
[3769.90s -> 3776.14s]  Pretty good hit chance on, uh, yeah, this is, this is like a power based, uh, tax. Okay. So we need
[3776.14s -> 3787.03s]  to do power. So let's take a look at battle because if you see here, the game is based on weeks. So
[3787.03s -> 3793.27s]  one loading screen is a week. So this week there's nothing going on next week. Nothing going on. So
[3793.27s -> 3799.58s]  essentially we have all of April and into may and in may there's going to be a tournament with a
[3799.58s -> 3805.86s]  thousand gold prize tutorial. Andy, I have to be tutorial. Andy, a lot of people have never seen
[3805.86s -> 3818.07s]  this before. Why would you compare this to Pokemon? You'll see, you'll see. All right. So we got some
[3818.07s -> 3828.65s]  time. Let's do some training training. So we want power. Okay. Dominant power is up. Fatigue up
[3828.65s -> 3836.12s]  study is intelligence run is life. So this one is power and life, but you lose speed. It's a bunch
[3836.12s -> 3847.40s]  of fatigue. I think that's not about his life is terrible. Probably life. These do a ton of stress
[3847.40s -> 3853.00s]  on the monster as well. I think we're just going to go with, and also when they're, when a monster
[3853.00s -> 3859.00s]  is a baby, like this monster is, they get a lot less stat gains until they get to like the prime
[3859.00s -> 3872.92s]  of their life. Let's just do, let's do health. I feel like health is important. Here we go again.
[3872.92s -> 3888.47s]  Come on. How'd you do? Yes. Plus two health. Still a baby. This will eventually, this will end up
[3888.47s -> 3897.62s]  being like plus 10 health plus 20 health. Uh, Bonnie four as well. Okay. Should we rest or should
[3897.62s -> 3908.46s]  we do it again? I need to buy like mint leaves and, um, and, uh, nut seeds, whatever it is again.
[3909.02s -> 3915.64s]  All right. Let's go again. Let's do it again. Although should I really work that hard as a
[3915.64s -> 3929.45s]  baby? Let's see. All right. We got one that I don't have to do any skill. Okay. Looks all right.
[3932.57s -> 3940.74s]  Work him. I don't want to, he's a baby. This is a baby. Errantry is you send them on a mission
[3940.74s -> 3948.44s]  and they can learn new skills, but we're not doing that right now. Let's just, let's do it. Let's
[3948.52s -> 3957.24s]  Okay. We're going to train again and then we're going to rest. They can fail these too.
[3957.24s -> 3966.62s]  Sometimes they, it's like, Oh no. Like I just said, Bonnie did not finish its drill,
[3967.50s -> 3980.98s]  scolded. No, the baby. It seems to be delighted. All right. I need to go. Uh, seems well. Let's
[3980.98s -> 3989.94s]  rest. I don't want to overdo it. Based stats are crazy on this guy. Okay. Yeah. Let's just relax.
[3989.94s -> 4002.15s]  Don't have to do anything. So rest, rest for the week. You want to let Bonnie rest? Yes. Perfect.
[4002.15s -> 4018.74s]  Don't be such a softy. I'm not. I, it's a, it's a baby. Loyalty 11 style soft. Let's do some drills.
[4018.74s -> 4042.09s]  You can do it. Oh, come on. Shit. Why Bonnie's did not finish their drill. Skulled them. It
[4042.09s -> 4051.19s]  seems disappointed. I, I can't be too, which food do you want to give it this month? All right.
[4051.19s -> 4056.36s]  I think I'm going to go with the, he hates cup jelly. All right. For those monster rancher,
[4056.76s -> 4064.79s]  enthusiast here, even if he hates cup jelly, does the stress reduction on cup jelly negate the fact
[4064.79s -> 4079.88s]  that he hates it? Cause I know that cup jelly reduces stress. He wants meat 300. Don't overeat
[4079.88s -> 4089.86s]  this though. Not worth it. All right. Well, he wants me 300 bucks. We're really going to gauge
[4089.86s -> 4095.78s]  if this is going to be long-term and not based on the amount of, uh, how good they are in tournaments.
[4095.78s -> 4103.13s]  And they're very well as well. Let's take a look at the battle calendar. All right. We have it.
[4103.13s -> 4110.15s]  There's a tournament coming up here. So that means if I want to train, it's either train once
[4112.55s -> 4119.32s]  or skip the tournament. Cause he doesn't even have a hundred health. What do you think?
[4119.32s -> 4128.79s]  We'll just go for it and see how we can do in a tournament train rest battle. Let's go for it
[4128.79s -> 4134.66s]  this time. Come on, actually complete it this time. I, I fucking love this game. This is the
[4134.66s -> 4142.57s]  only thing I'm going to stream for the next 10 years. And I mean that in gerbil years. So like
[4142.57s -> 4159.80s]  a week, there we go. Nice. Good job. Seems well. Okay. 15 soft. Should we rest? All right. We're
[4159.80s -> 4165.83s]  going to rest and there's time for the first tournament for Bonnie. I'm so excited. Just wait
[4165.83s -> 4180.41s]  till you see the battle. It's, it's awesome. All right. Are we ready? First fight. Grade E round
[4180.41s -> 4188.10s]  Robin four entrance. Bonnie has little loyalty now and may act confused. Do you still want to
[4188.10s -> 4195.16s]  participate? Yes, I do. Pay attention to your monster's guts level during the battle. If the
[4195.16s -> 4201.32s]  guts level is low, it can't use an attack. Guts essentially is mana. It regens. Don't get KO'd
[4201.32s -> 4206.12s]  or your monster may get injured. So just give up when it's in trouble. Four foot button to give up.
[4206.12s -> 4220.89s]  The blue sky cup. It's snowing. It's hard to believe it's spring here in the Papa's arena.
[4220.89s -> 4229.14s]  Under this condition, blue sky cup is about to start. Jax, let's go for it. What's the
[4229.14s -> 4240.50s]  competition look like? All right. We got Bonnie four. Harry kicks Oakley man and Leon. All right.
[4240.50s -> 4250.14s]  This is kind of a mirror. I just dropped out information. What do you got? Our opponent,
[4250.14s -> 4255.27s]  Leon has high skill or to KO before it gets our monster. Can I see the data?
[4255.83s -> 4264.01s]  Do I get to see the data? Do you want to give Bonnie advice during the battle? Yes.
[4264.01s -> 4273.80s]  Because the CPU is an idiot. I wonder how you, oh, I'm going to kick the shit out of you.
[4273.80s -> 4278.70s]  All right. So there's like things on the sidebar, but I have a controller. I wonder how this works.
[4278.70s -> 4291.22s]  Can I just move with the controller? How do I move? I don't know how to move. He's confused
[4291.22s -> 4300.12s]  because it's based on where you are. What is going on? All right. These controls,
[4300.28s -> 4306.42s]  I got to figure this out. That was a big hit though. So I can't, how do I move left and right?
[4306.42s -> 4310.26s]  I want to like, is it L and R? Okay. All right. All right. It's L and R. I'm going to lose maybe
[4310.90s -> 4323.64s]  again, quick. All right. So it's L. So the, all the moves are based on just position. I can't do
[4323.64s -> 4330.54s]  scratch if I'm back in the second position, like darkest dungeon, except with one person,
[4330.54s -> 4338.98s]  I have to be in that exact slot to do that move. Just so you know, prediction result was yes.
[4343.11s -> 4356.50s]  Kicked his ass. All right. Bonnie one. All right. Versus Oakley man. That's a beanbag Sonic.
[4358.90s -> 4364.86s]  We can't get too excited. You're going to get wrecked by Oakley man. Okay.
[4364.86s -> 4378.78s]  Eric kicks one. All right. Bonnie versus Oakley man. Let's go. All right. You got a lot of health
[4378.78s -> 4386.39s]  and you have a lot of power. So it's L and R to move back and forth. And then it's just A to do
[4386.39s -> 4397.13s]  technique. So I just get in the right spot and do it. Okay. I'm going to back up, build it up.
[4397.13s -> 4407.61s]  All right. Go for it. Nope. Scratch again. 20 damage. Back up, back up, back up, back up,
[4407.61s -> 4422.07s]  back up. That's a lot. Holy shit. That hurt. Good dodge. Dodge again. Bring it together.
[4422.07s -> 4429.88s]  I got a lot of guts. I got to get in close. Get in close. Come on. I have so much guts.
[4429.88s -> 4446.26s]  Just keep using it. Dodge. I have so much guts. Just keep using it. Come on, dude. Get it. Oh,
[4448.58s -> 4469.61s]  again, again, again, again, again. Guts. So every move requires a certain amount of guts.
[4469.61s -> 4475.56s]  You regenerate guts over time. Every move has a percentage to hit, which is increased, of course,
[4475.56s -> 4487.67s]  by skill. I think we're still okay. Oakley man needs to lose. I don't think it's going to happen.
[4487.67s -> 4501.64s]  Okay. Leon won. Everybody has won one game. We're going to have to do it again. All right. Let's go.
[4502.20s -> 4516.04s]  A bit 30K. I should win this. My skill is way hard. Got to get in close and we're doing bite.
[4516.68s -> 4522.14s]  What are you going to do? You haven't moved this far away. Shit. All right. Stay in close.
[4522.14s -> 4536.92s]  Don't let him get away. He does the most damage. Back it up and do scratch. Damn, that hurt.
[4537.56s -> 4562.63s]  Come on, dude. Really? Get over there. What are you fucking dodge at? Scratch again. Fuck,
[4562.63s -> 4572.84s]  I'm going to lose. That 95 health sucks. Absolute asshole. Give me a crit. Come on,
[4572.84s -> 4586.28s]  again, again, again, again. What's the percentage? Did I lose my percentage? Oh, yeah.
[4589.80s -> 4600.71s]  I got two wins. We're good. I got to try to remember. Okay. So I have to select the move
[4600.71s -> 4608.18s]  and then be in the range or do I just have to be in the range? I forget. All right. Oakley man
[4608.18s -> 4627.90s]  lose and I win. Come on, Leon. Kick his ass because I can beat Leon. It's over. We have
[4627.90s -> 4631.98s]  monsters whose scores are tied. So we will now hold a tie breaking match to determine which I'm
[4631.98s -> 4644.41s]  going to lose. Do I forfeit before I get him hurt? I don't know. I don't think I'm going to beat
[4644.41s -> 4655.06s]  Oakley man. Do it. Fight. I can't. I'm going to lose. He might die. They can die. If he gets knocked
[4655.06s -> 4664.52s]  out, you can actually get the, you can actually kill him. It's not worth it. All right. I'm going
[4664.52s -> 4677.42s]  to say, so what's withdraw or drop out. Isn't it the same thing? I'm with them. Yeah, I'm
[4677.42s -> 4693.94s]  withdrawing. Withdraw. I don't want him to get hurt. Oakley man is the winner. I did put it for
[4693.94s -> 4702.06s]  the first time ever. He's a baby. This is the result of the tournament. I got, I got in second
[4702.06s -> 4709.29s]  place. I get 500 bucks. I get 600 bucks. Okay. It was a thousand dollars to win and get fame
[4710.78s -> 4722.60s]  and potentially die or $600 to come in second place and be alive. I gained one fame. Oh no,
[4722.60s -> 4730.87s]  nevermind. Nobody cares. Jax, I think Bonnie Fours has learned a lesson in this tournament.
[4730.87s -> 4745.38s]  See, look, always learning. Always learning. See, if I didn't withdraw, that doesn't happen. Good.
[4745.38s -> 4753.06s]  Nice work. Bonnie Fours could not be a champion, but I think it did a good job. Praise it. Yes,
[4753.06s -> 4763.42s]  absolutely. It was the first, first competition. Keep it up. I'm going to Oakley man's stream.
[4763.42s -> 4777.02s]  All right. It's time to rest. Well, guess what? Oakley man stays in E rank their entire broadcast.
[4777.02s -> 4787.26s]  So just be aware of that. All right. Food. I'm thinking we go all out here and we do tablets.
[4787.26s -> 4793.03s]  Tablets reduce stress, stress, whatever. And they make it so they're in a good position to train.
[4793.03s -> 4810.81s]  What do you guys think? I think tablets. I'm going for it. I also need to go to the market and buy
[4810.81s -> 4816.25s]  some mint leaves because that reduces stress too. Because otherwise your monster dies in like a year.
[4816.25s -> 4821.85s]  The first official tournament is scheduled at the end of the month. You have to prepare
[4821.85s -> 4838.87s]  Barney right now. Who is it? Oh, you have mail. Thank you. Who's it from? Look at this.
[4838.87s -> 4846.58s]  Errantry is usually expensive. Shall we send Barney four? Notice this month the
[4846.58s -> 4850.10s]  Errantry Management Office is promoting a price reduction for your monster's errantry.
[4850.10s -> 4859.59s]  We cordially encourage each friend to participate during this period. An errant, errantry. Okay.
[4859.59s -> 4870.30s]  How much cheaper is it? We want to send our monster to an errantry. Oh, you have to fill in
[4870.30s -> 4876.49s]  the paper there for errantry. I'm not doing it. Write down the monster name and the trainer's name.
[4876.49s -> 4884.66s]  Yes. Yeah, you send them on a mission and they get stats and they find items and shit,
[4884.66s -> 4892.98s]  but it's really taxing on them. It takes a ton of fatigue.
[4892.98s -> 4897.27s]  Maybe I shouldn't do errantry when the monster is this young. I don't think it's a good idea.
[4897.27s -> 4905.78s]  Errantry term is a month. During that period you're not allowed to contact with a monster.
[4905.78s -> 4910.57s]  You choose a location from five different sites. It'll cost two thousand dollars.
[4910.57s -> 4916.54s]  Some locations are not for the low ranked monsters. Also, a wild monster appears around
[4916.54s -> 4923.10s]  here occasionally. Yeah, and they kick the shit out of you. I remember this. Yeah, it's the monster
[4923.10s -> 4927.70s]  who attacks monsters during the errantry. If your monster wins, you'll get the prize money.
[4927.70s -> 4935.16s]  Of course, there is a chance that your monster will get killed. Is that good? You could do it.
[4935.16s -> 4942.97s]  And then I'd fucking die. Discount. It's a huge discount this month. I think I'm just gonna do it.
[4946.10s -> 4951.72s]  All right, what do you think? This is a huge, huge skill in life. I think we need to do life,
[4951.72s -> 4966.02s]  though. Hour in life? I need to hit way harder. The stats suck. Don't do it yet. Is he too young?
[4967.69s -> 4975.35s]  It's probably bad, but it's a thousand dollars off. I'm just like opening the door to like the
[4975.35s -> 4982.36s]  back slider of the house to like a fucking puppy and going, yeah, go, go for it. Find some items.
[4982.36s -> 4990.98s]  That's probably a really bad idea. I don't want to do that. I'm not doing that. No,
[4990.98s -> 5002.47s]  like that's too dangerous. Too dangerous. We'll have him. I need to go to the store.
[5002.47s -> 5018.22s]  I want to buy some stuff. Uh, welcome to the market. I want to get.
[5018.22s -> 5027.94s]  You already have a monster. What if I get items? Lab? This must be your first visit.
[5027.94s -> 5033.72s]  My name is Dadge. I'm in charge here. You want to combine or freeze this place to do it? Okay.
[5033.72s -> 5041.54s]  What do you like to do? Uh, so what happens is you can freeze a monster. It stays at the exact age,
[5041.54s -> 5048.65s]  the exact stats and everything before they die. And you put them into cryogenic freezing chambers
[5048.65s -> 5063.08s]  and then you combine their DNA. Okay. So it's not there. Where is it? Lab? Job? Job? You can come
[5063.08s -> 5081.26s]  here whenever you need a job. Do the job. Where do I buy items? Is it not unlocked yet? The item
[5081.26s -> 5090.81s]  store? Yeah. The market doesn't let me do it. Or is it on the farm? He's so tiny. Item. Oh, shop.
[5090.81s -> 5111.74s]  Here we go. So we need to get nuts and mints. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Let me buy. Buy. Please get out
[5111.74s -> 5123.29s]  of my way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. You can
[5123.29s -> 5129.16s]  fit more texts than this, by the way. Like what are you going to do? Second line, third line,
[5129.24s -> 5135.80s]  there's four lines of text available. All right. Monsters love to snack on this tasty fruit.
[5135.80s -> 5146.98s]  Candy. Uh, most of these reduce or add stress and fatigue. Mint leaf. How much are they? It relaxes
[5146.98s -> 5152.10s]  your monster and relieves its stress. I need to buy a bunch of these. I'm going to buy five mint
[5152.10s -> 5160.82s]  leaves. Sweet jelly, sour jelly, nuts oil. Okay. This helps with fatigue. I'm going to buy five of
[5160.82s -> 5170.30s]  these. All right. Now I need to save some money. It's rumored that a monster will become popular
[5170.30s -> 5186.17s]  if it eats this, like a fame fruit. I'll get a few mangoes too. It's like a little treat.
[5186.17s -> 5196.60s]  So I'm going to use mint leaf, right? I should probably use both of these because it just helps.
[5196.60s -> 5207.77s]  Did you get high to do this? No. We'll do the mint. I'm going to do both. I think, I think I have
[5207.77s -> 5218.76s]  this correct. Take it. This reduces your overall stress by a certain percentage so you live longer.
[5218.76s -> 5236.34s]  You're supposed to use one of these each month. That makes sense. Only one at a time. Okay. All
[5236.34s -> 5243.42s]  right. So we've given that. How are you doing right now? All right. Get in there. Elf,
[5243.42s -> 5264.58s]  throw us a run. What's this like ice cube thing? Cheated. Cheated? Barney cheated on its drill.
[5267.24s -> 5273.45s]  Sometimes you got to know what it takes. That's, that's my boy. That's my smart boy.
[5279.27s -> 5290.54s]  He's very fond of me. Let's do it again. What's the next? I want to, I want to stuff
[5290.54s -> 5297.45s]  fucking fist into that motherfucker's face. Whatever his name is. That guy, the guy looked
[5297.45s -> 5301.99s]  like a rock. What was his name? Oakley man. I'm not doing the tournament. Not yet. I need
[5301.99s -> 5319.51s]  at least a hundred health. No, it's not worth it. Too much. Do it again. Help me. I'm trapped.
[5319.51s -> 5329.13s]  Cheating again. Yeah, that's my boy. Maybe I shouldn't praise the cheating because
[5329.13s -> 5339.19s]  it's going to do it more. That's probably not a good idea. Hey, did you, hey son, did you win?
[5342.54s -> 5355.98s]  All right. Don't do that anymore. Seems sorry. All right. Barney as well. If you're well, then
[5355.98s -> 5368.42s]  why not just do it again? When's the next major tournament? It's the official cup. I don't know
[5368.42s -> 5383.08s]  if they're ready for this. I don't think they're ready for this. I could try. Rest up for the week.
[5383.08s -> 5396.65s]  We'll enter the official cup tomorrow. It's only cheating if you get caught. Yes. Let's enter the
[5396.65s -> 5405.35s]  tournament. Barney's in good shape. I'll bet you, I bet you'll rake the points. Very well. Good.
[5405.35s -> 5412.60s]  Let's do it. Official cup. This gets us out of E rank. If we can even do it, which I don't,
[5412.60s -> 5429.53s]  who knows if we can even do it. All right. Let's fucking go. Just give up if you need to. Yeah. I
[5429.53s -> 5435.83s]  don't want to get any, I don't want to get anybody killed here. Grade E. Young monsters
[5435.83s -> 5442.87s]  gathering the place with ambitions to be a tomorrow's star. It's the time to start the
[5442.87s -> 5452.79s]  official tournament. It is the time. All right. Official tournament. Let's go. This game looks
[5452.79s -> 5469.54s]  great by the way. Can I just say? Oakley man's in this fucking competition. What if I just withdraw?
[5469.54s -> 5478.17s]  All right. Let's go. Let's go. All right. Let's hopefully I don't get killed. His health is so
[5478.17s -> 5499.11s]  bad. I need crits. A lot of them. All right. Let's go for it. Back it up again. Damn it.
[5499.11s -> 5518.41s]  What is his speed at? 55% chance to hit. Oh my God. What is your speed at? I just have to win
[5518.41s -> 5526.81s]  with, uh, I don't have to, I don't have to KO him. Nice. Good job. Oh my God. Do it again.
[5527.45s -> 5536.38s]  Again, again, again, again, again. Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up. Get out of his range
[5536.38s -> 5541.48s]  all the way back, all the way back. Just run it out. Run the clock out. Oh, Oakley man. You
[5541.48s -> 5549.32s]  just got fucking destroyed. I just beat him out of range. Get out. See you later. I win. Although I
[5549.32s -> 5563.48s]  got to beat everybody else. Nice. All right. Oakley man. Now you're on the ropes. Good luck.
[5568.07s -> 5574.47s]  Although I have not seen these other people though. I want that thing, whatever it is,
[5574.47s -> 5586.20s]  it's like a weird dolphin. A one and one here. We've seen these two. All right. That was close.
[5591.24s -> 5601.74s]  Bunny versus gnats. Is it a bunny? I think the bunny's fast. Oh, you're dead in two hits. Goodbye.
[5601.74s -> 5604.78s]  Why did you even enter in the competition? What's the, what's the, what's the point?
[5604.78s -> 5610.14s]  Why would you enter a monster with 57 health? I'm going to kill you in two hits and I'm going to,
[5610.14s -> 5626.25s]  I'm going to, I'm going to try to kill you. That was kind of fucked up. Yeah. All right.
[5629.02s -> 5631.74s]  Oh, all right. So you want to fight. All right. That's how it is. You want to fight.
[5633.22s -> 5648.50s]  Now I am going to go flood. Stay close. Stay in close. He has one fucking move and it's in the
[5648.50s -> 5655.11s]  third slot. Just stay in close. Oh my God. He's going to beat me. Anger. He's pissed.
[5659.72s -> 5675.91s]  Grit. What is that? He gets an extra health. Oh boy. This is bad. Get in close. He has one move.
[5676.47s -> 5689.61s]  It was like fart and punch in the third slot. I wonder what does anger do? I forget. Okay.
[5693.72s -> 5700.39s]  It's really important that Juno mule loses this fight. All right. That's the one to beat.
[5701.03s -> 5712.14s]  Oakley man's going to beat Leon. Beat him last time. Holy shit. What happened? Leon got stronger.
[5712.14s -> 5722.84s]  Leon is not. Oakley man sucks ass. All right. Interesting. I got to go three and oh,
[5723.48s -> 5754.97s]  I might actually lose this one. I don't know. I'm concerned. Stay in close. Scratch. Get in
[5754.97s -> 5759.42s]  close again. Bite. Bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite,
[5759.42s -> 5771.02s]  bite, bite. Dodge. Let me do my bite. Come on. He keeps pushing me. He keeps getting me back.
[5772.02s -> 5776.97s]  Bite. Don't get confused by bite. You just bite him with your mouth. He doesn't want me to do
[5776.97s -> 5783.03s]  anything. This closed. There you go. Again. Do it again. Do it again. I have plenty of guts.
[5783.67s -> 5799.86s]  More. Again. Don't get confused. Come on. 57% chance. Give me a fucking break.
[5799.86s -> 5812.02s]  Let's get a win by percentages here. Oh my God. I think I just lost. Did I lose? Oh, nice. That was
[5812.02s -> 5824.22s]  close. Bonnie's pretty good. This is the only second tournament ever for Reno. Imagine the
[5824.22s -> 5832.54s]  doubters. Yeah. What the fuck is going on here? We got, we got way too many doubters in the chat
[5832.54s -> 5846.55s]  right now. Too many of you. All right. This is important. I'm very shocked by this in one month.
[5846.55s -> 5855.59s]  Leon is now unbeatable. All right. This fight doesn't matter. I'm not going to see either one
[5855.59s -> 5863.74s]  of these again. Anyways, this is like championship fight coming up here. What? How did you get so much?
[5863.74s -> 5889.34s]  How did you get so good method? Oh, it's power. Let's do it. Let's go. I'm curious what the stat
[5889.34s -> 5896.49s]  change was. It seems like it's kind of a huge change. No, it's not. Oh, did he beat everybody?
[5897.13s -> 5905.90s]  I have better stats than him. And I had more trouble than he did. It's okay. What this fight
[5905.90s -> 5922.25s]  has to be is just getting close and spam bite it in close or go, go, go, go, go. He's so much
[5922.25s -> 5930.28s]  bigger than me. Look at how much bigger he is than me or don't let him fight. Get out of here.
[5930.28s -> 5942.17s]  Tournament over. I won E rank. Let's go. Oh, I love this game. It's so fun. It is now impossible
[5942.17s -> 5962.23s]  for me to lose the tournament. I think I just get a buy, right? Who have I not fought? There's one
[5962.23s -> 5971.75s]  person I haven't fought. Who is it? Oh, it's you. I could lose this. I just forfeit. Who cares? I just
[5971.75s -> 5984.33s]  win. I'm 4-0. Would that be shitty if I was just like looked over there and I was like, no, I'm good.
[5984.89s -> 6002.41s]  I just win for the money. All right. I don't know the strategy. The strategy here might be to run
[6002.41s -> 6021.67s]  away. Those stats are insane. The fuck? How do I do dispel on a controller? I wonder. Dispel is when
[6021.67s -> 6025.19s]  you're close. You can press a certain button combination and it goes boom. And it knocks you
[6025.19s -> 6033.22s]  guys back all the way. Eleanor at the same time. No help. I mean, don't tell him I'm trying to win a
[6033.22s -> 6041.99s]  tournament. All right, let's go. He has nothing long range. I could just, I got a strategy here.
[6041.99s -> 6067.46s]  See if it works. Oh, he's getting confused. Get in close. Dodge it. What the fuck? Do a move. Do
[6067.46s -> 6077.03s]  a move already. Do your bite. He's literally right in front of you. Get angry. Get angry. Bite him.
[6077.91s -> 6101.19s]  Bite his throat. I was spamming. I still win the tournament. Yeah, I'm four and one. He's three. I
[6101.19s -> 6113.38s]  won the tournament. I win. It doesn't matter. Oh, wait. Okay. If Leon wins this. Oh, you've
[6113.38s -> 6118.82s]  got, you lost to the fucking 50 health rabbit. Oh, you deserve to not be in the top two.
[6122.17s -> 6131.54s]  You lost to the rabbit. The rabbit sucks. Must've been tired. Yeah, now I actually win. Oh,
[6131.54s -> 6139.54s]  they'll wait. Oakley. No, Oakley, man. No, I'm good. Tournament's over. I won. Bonnie Fours is the
[6139.54s -> 6158.76s]  winner. Nice job. Do a dance. That screenshot. This is the result of this tournament. Prize 500.
[6159.40s -> 6175.48s]  700 bucks. Some more fans. Eight people thought that was cool. I got eight new fans. Hey, Jax.
[6176.12s -> 6187.05s]  I think Bonnie's has learned a lesson in the tournament. So smart. See, look. Health just
[6187.05s -> 6208.39s]  leveled up. Very good. Excellent job. Praise. Very delighted. Nice work. All right. What food for
[6208.39s -> 6213.90s]  this month? This is important. Should we give him meat because he loves it? Or should we just keep
[6213.90s -> 6229.03s]  going with the tablets? I think the play here is probably tablets, but they love meat. So they just
[6229.03s -> 6235.62s]  did a good tournament. They just won. Let's reward with the thing that he likes the most. Have some
[6235.62s -> 6254.57s]  meat. Yes. Who is it? Is this Jax's residence? Please sign here. Okay. Thank you. Good. Have
[6254.57s -> 6266.73s]  a nice day. That's kind of like passive aggressive. It's from the IMA. International Monsters
[6266.73s -> 6271.93s]  Association card. Based on your performance, we will grant you the rank mentioned. First rank.
[6271.93s -> 6280.98s]  Oh, maybe I can now go open up the new capsule. You know what I'm talking about? I think so.
[6280.98s -> 6285.14s]  I'm pretty sure I know what you're talking about, but just go ahead and explain it again.
[6285.86s -> 6292.86s]  Trainer ranking is the official document of all trainers by rank from beginner to master.
[6292.86s -> 6298.38s]  It's every trainer's dream to reach master ranking. We're at the first level, so we have nine ranks to
[6298.38s -> 6310.84s]  pass. Let's make it. I'm excited. You hear about the meat? Master Pabs, why are you excited?
[6310.84s -> 6317.22s]  Not good for your health. Don't be silly. A battle between IMA and FIMBA is finally about
[6317.22s -> 6324.38s]  to begin. How can I not be excited about this? Really? FIMBA is the neighboring Continents
[6324.38s -> 6332.49s]  Monster Association, isn't it? Yes, it's finally confirmed. Every four years, we will select
[6332.49s -> 6341.62s]  representatives from five different grades. It's five on five battles. Representative, representative.
[6341.62s -> 6346.22s]  I guess we cannot be the one. No, if you win at an elimination tournament held at the end
[6346.22s -> 6353.66s]  of this month, you'll be the one. Why don't you enter the tournament? Okay, let's do it.
[6355.77s -> 6369.83s]  Let's represent this association. It's great to be a representative. We got to be one. Bonnie depends
[6369.83s -> 6382.89s]  on us too much. I guess we spoiled it. Seems well. Oh, but they've been doing so good, though.
[6384.09s -> 6394.58s]  No, all right. Let's do some training. When's the next thing? All right, so we unlocked C rank
[6394.58s -> 6403.86s]  battles. No way am I going to be able to do one. Elimination grade D. What's the one that they're
[6403.86s -> 6414.58s]  talking about? This is the official D cup. Okay, I'm not doing C. I'll get my ass kicked.
[6414.58s -> 6425.03s]  I think I don't think I can do. I got to train him a little more. All right, let's do how about one
[6425.03s -> 6438.62s]  of the old diseases is he right now? How old are you? Three months. What's the age that they
[6439.26s -> 6447.16s]  kind of get older? Six months because eventually they get to a point where the training is way
[6447.16s -> 6464.71s]  more efficient. One year. Okay, so we got a little bit more time. We'll do some drills. Let's do
[6465.51s -> 6479.11s]  power. Let's do power. I'm going to feed him some mint. Good job. That was a huge success
[6479.11s -> 6493.93s]  wasn't it? Oh, because huge success I think is a way more increase. Bonnie's tired. Let's do
[6495.05s -> 6507.27s]  let's give you some mint leaves, some nut oil. Someone was going to do mild voodoo on you. Would
[6507.27s -> 6519.34s]  you want to know or would you rather continue to be oblivious to it? Can you like leave me alone?
[6519.34s -> 6530.41s]  Would you just like leave me alone? Like you know what I mean? Like why can't you just leave me alone?
[6530.41s -> 6546.62s]  All right, mint leaf. Let's go. That's not an option. All right, well can you do the kind
[6546.62s -> 6553.30s]  of voodoo that makes me get like a 10 million dollar lottery ticket? Are you going to do bad?
[6553.30s -> 6564.76s]  Are you going to like curse me and shit? Do you feel an itch on your forearm right here?
[6564.76s -> 6585.35s]  That was weird. All right, let's go. Training. Are you still tired? Let's rest. What if we do
[6585.35s -> 6595.18s]  healing spells? Yeah, do healing shit. I want you to heal and give me good luck and good tidings
[6595.18s -> 6601.11s]  and shit. Don't like make me itchy. That sucks. Don't do that. Why would you do that? What did I
[6601.11s -> 6620.12s]  ever do to you? I'm gonna start wearing like garlic on my neck. Uh, power again. Let's get a
[6620.12s -> 6631.67s]  huge success here. All right, Bonnie says, I want to play with you next week. Do you grant its request?
[6631.67s -> 6642.07s]  Do you play with them? Yes, but we're spoiling. We're spoiling the shit out of them. Yes, of course.
[6642.07s -> 6660.06s]  Anything for my little baby. Yes, we can play next week. Ooh, nice job. 150 power. I'll be happy with
[6660.06s -> 6668.36s]  one like 70. Jax, didn't you make a promise that you'd play with Bonnie? Are you going to play?
[6669.16s -> 6680.17s]  Yes. Good. Bonnie's going to be happy. Aren't you happy with the nice weather, Bonnie? Today,
[6680.17s -> 6686.63s]  Jax will play with you as promised. Okay, let's play. I need some lip balm. There it is.
[6688.42s -> 6700.82s]  The mud ball fight. Tap the screen to find the monster on the field. Mobile port. Mobile port.
[6701.86s -> 6716.42s]  Sorry. Tap the screen. The arrow on the lower left of the screen will show you which direction
[6716.42s -> 6723.02s]  your monster is. You can move sideways while still facing forward by using the moving buttons. Okay.
[6723.58s -> 6732.25s]  When you see your monster, press the okay button to change to the aiming mode. Now touch to set
[6732.25s -> 6740.01s]  your sights on the monster. This is a pretty good mobile port. Okay. In fact, hold on a second.
[6740.57s -> 6753.75s]  Is this going on iPad? Does that mean that this is going to go on iPad? Is it on iPad? That does
[6753.75s -> 6760.81s]  not upset me. It's on the Switch. That's not iPad though. iPad's very different. I don't mind if I
[6760.81s -> 6772.82s]  drop like the iPad in the toilet or in the bathtub. It's on iPad right now. No it's not. Who uses an
[6772.82s -> 6781.43s]  iPad? Me. All right. So we got to aim and fire, throw a ball. Be careful because you cannot move
[6781.43s -> 6789.26s]  in the aiming mode. I'm going to lose this so we'll just figure out how it works. The number that
[6789.26s -> 6809.27s]  appears in the upper left is Jax's points. Do your best to try and beat Bonnie. Let's go. Ready?
[6809.27s -> 6820.46s]  What the fuck was that? How am I supposed to do this? What happened to him? Why did he just fall?
[6820.46s -> 6847.82s]  What's wrong with him? Oh it's tied. Stop. Why do you have so many more balls than I do? This is
[6847.82s -> 6873.35s]  unfair. Oh I beat him. Hey good game Barney. I didn't lose to a baby. I won. Did I just like
[6873.35s -> 6881.50s]  Billy Madison play dodgeball with a three-year-old? A four-year-old? What? I shouldn't be happy about
[6881.50s -> 6895.14s]  that. I should be annoyed. All right food. Let's go with tablets. I want you to get big and strong
[6895.14s -> 6904.57s]  and I want you to have lots of power. Be careful you don't run out of money. I'm not even. I just
[6905.05s -> 6915.66s]  spoiled. All right. When's the next battle? There's no way I'm gonna do this. Not a chance. I don't
[6915.66s -> 6931.51s]  think I'm gonna do this one either. I'll do. We'll go. We'll do the official D. I want more training.
[6931.51s -> 6956.58s]  I'm gonna go for it. Huge success. I'm over. Okay. Leveled up my power. Over 150. Do some defense.
[6956.58s -> 6979.22s]  I could go see if I can unlock the other monsters. We need to freeze. Freeze this guy. I don't think
[6979.22s -> 6986.57s]  freezing hurts him or does anything bad. Yeah freezing I think just locks him. I don't think
[6986.57s -> 6994.18s]  this hurts the middle. Somebody tell me if this adds to stress or something. I don't think it
[6994.18s -> 7004.49s]  does. I think you just kind of freeze for a second because you can just unfreeze. Yeah just freezes
[7004.49s -> 7014.06s]  them at their current exact moment. Okay. See you later. That was kind of sad but it's okay.
[7017.90s -> 7034.78s]  Let's see if I can get toxic. Okay here we go. Toxic by Britney Spears. Do I have enough ranking?
[7034.78s -> 7048.12s]  I don't. I am an authorized trainer. Don't you see my license? What are you talking about?
[7048.12s -> 7063.26s]  Give me something else. Hatsune Miku? Okay Miku. There is no Miku. I guess I'm gonna go with Bird
[7063.26s -> 7095.35s]  by Mikuni Shimokawa. What? It's rare. Remember that. Write that down. Uh Dino Crisis. Dino Crisis
[7096.15s -> 7135.21s]  What about Dino? Dino Dinoasorius. Dinoasorius. Viva La Vida? Dino Crisis by Capcom. It's a bunny.
[7135.21s -> 7144.34s]  Cute. Yes it's a very cute monster. Do you take? I'm not taking this. No the monster sucks ass.
[7144.34s -> 7164.89s]  Look at this. No. No. How about Dino Crisis 2? Dino Crisis 2. What's with all this rare shit? Come
[7164.89s -> 7190.94s]  on. I have to win another couple tournaments. Weird Al? Time for Weird Al? Kanye? No. Gorillas?
[7195.21s -> 7219.85s]  Aw Demon Days let's go. What we get from Demon Days? All right. What is that? Cute. Yes it's
[7219.85s -> 7229.66s]  a very cute monster. Holy smokes that's 200 intelligence. That's almost 200 base intelligence.
[7230.22s -> 7252.42s]  Those are gonna hit so fucking hard. That's that is the keeper. All right name. Noodle? Noodle.
[7252.42s -> 7271.02s]  Who's L? No that's Nudie. L is right here. Nudie. I don't want it to be Nudie. Noodle.
[7274.02s -> 7288.39s]  Not Nudie. All right let's do it. What do you get for moves? Dude we could combine Noodle and Bonnie.
[7288.39s -> 7305.91s]  You know what I'm saying? I wonder what we'd get. Barney Noodle. All right what do you got? So you have
[7306.47s -> 7318.42s]  monster data. Let's see. All right E. Noodle. Level 4 intelligence already. What do you get for moves?
[7321.80s -> 7330.52s]  Nature. Best nature. Likes nuts oil and doesn't like tablets. Okay you got a few moves here.
[7330.52s -> 7340.55s]  This is bolt. Holy shit this could be insane. This thing is guaranteed to hit but it kind of sucks
[7341.11s -> 7353.34s]  damage wise. All these are such high hit percentage but not very powerful. I wonder how powerful it is.
[7353.34s -> 7358.79s]  Why would you use kick instead of pat? The only difference is I mean I guess it's a little bit
[7358.79s -> 7379.51s]  less guts cost but who cares. All right well we're gonna give her a item. We're gonna give nuts oil.
[7379.51s -> 7386.47s]  That should help. Now let's do some training. Just intelligence. Let's get it over 200. Study.
[7386.47s -> 7401.69s]  Are you learning? I don't. Okay I guess they learned. That's a level up. Level 5 and level 6
[7401.69s -> 7425.29s]  intelligence. Do it again. But this time I want health. Her health is really low. No cheating.
[7425.37s -> 7438.89s]  Good work. Why are you black and white? Wait I am? Does the webcam look like washed out?
[7438.89s -> 7450.14s]  Is it? Oh my god it kind of is. It does feel like an old movie. Oh shit hold on let me fix this.
[7450.14s -> 7477.29s]  It is really washed out. Is that better? Can you see me? Good his red face is back. Need more
[7477.29s -> 7488.18s]  red face. All right the life is bad. We gotta keep doing life. Still doing all right. Do it again.
[7488.18s -> 7495.35s]  Is there a light? You don't want to do because this is considered to be heavy work and when
[7495.35s -> 7500.97s]  they're a baby heavy work you don't really get that big of an increase. So it's kind of stupid
[7500.97s -> 7507.56s]  to do heavy training because you're just really taking time off of their life for no reason because
[7507.56s -> 7516.62s]  they don't get that high of a gain when they're a baby. Uh we'll do life again. I I think that
[7516.62s -> 7520.14s]  I think she's gonna wipe the floor with the first train with the first tournament.
[7520.14s -> 7540.02s]  For me you need a haircut? Yeah I know. All right what did you like? You don't like tablets.
[7540.02s -> 7547.77s]  I think cup jelly is this the yeah let's get cup jelly. She doesn't like tablets. Cup jelly
[7547.77s -> 7550.17s]  is the best thing to do because it's the only thing that just reduces stress right off the
[7550.17s -> 7563.99s]  bat no matter what. Look at this a diamond mark? If we collect five of these we'll get a fun can.
[7563.99s -> 7573.98s]  Really? I always wanted this as a kid. It's like pepsi points. All right official tournament end
[7573.98s -> 7586.25s]  of the month. When is the official tournament E rank? She's gonna destroy everybody. Not concerned
[7586.25s -> 7606.62s]  at all. I need life. So what um it's all right don't worry about it. This huge success right
[7606.62s -> 7631.90s]  is that just a flat percentage? No it's fine. We'll say great. Okay rest. This is just like
[7631.90s -> 7642.22s]  nintendogs. All right we got I don't think I'm even gonna I think I'm just gonna rest.
[7644.65s -> 7663.62s]  Yeah double rest. Tournament let's go. Official tournaments happening this week seems to be good
[7663.62s -> 7691.27s]  shape. All right let's go for it. Yeah it doesn't matter she's 200 intelligence. All right it's the
[7691.27s -> 7700.49s]  same group of clowns that we've have absolutely destroyed before so I'm not scared at all. This
[7700.49s -> 7705.96s]  is like a person running into a Pokemon field and kicking the shit out of Pikachu. I don't think a
[7705.96s -> 7711.96s]  person would really do that. I think Pikachu would kill you as a person. Oh wait we got a new uh a
[7711.96s -> 7719.80s]  new person here. All right so the goal here is we're trying to we're gonna stay back in the third
[7719.80s -> 7729.37s]  slot and we're just gonna zap zap zap zap over and over again. Here we go see how it works.
[7732.09s -> 7743.66s]  Confused. That's not good. Back it up. That's a cool move but I wish it would work. Oh my god
[7743.66s -> 7764.33s]  she's confused. Bolt! Move forward. Oh my god really? That sucks actually. Oh shit she's gonna
[7764.33s -> 7778.62s]  lose. That should be doing way more. I have no guts. Stay back. Oh my god please don't die.
[7778.62s -> 7800.34s]  She was not ready. Glass cannon. Glass cup. Didn't do anything. Her move was doing 10 damage.
[7800.98s -> 7813.94s]  I think with proper training it should be okay. That's a lot of it. There's definitely a move you
[7813.94s -> 7826.06s]  can learn that's a higher damage intelligence move. This game is rad. Yeah it is and we haven't
[7826.06s -> 7835.03s]  even scratched the surface. There's so many different monster combinations. It's just a fun
[7835.03s -> 7846.97s]  game too. I think I believe in okay we should destroy Oakley man because one reason defense is
[7846.97s -> 7855.62s]  for power attacks only. Intelligence is also defense against intelligence attacks. If I don't
[7855.62s -> 7871.50s]  beat Oakley man here this is a big problem. Let's go. Don't be... What's confusing? Shoot him.
[7873.70s -> 7891.08s]  All right. All right. That looks good to me. Back it up. Ease? I don't know what that is. Ease.
[7893.37s -> 7905.98s]  Stay back. Get some guts. Don't ever do that move again. Don't ever do that again.
[7906.62s -> 7915.93s]  Holy shit. You're gonna kill me in two hits. Back it up. Back up. Back up. Oh my god. Back the fuck
[7915.93s -> 7931.80s]  up. Back. Get over there and fucking do it. I need the combo to push people because I don't know what
[7931.80s -> 7937.22s]  the gamepad combination is to like do the push. I need to learn that it's like one of the most
[7937.22s -> 7957.13s]  important things in the whole game. He lost to a puddle of oatmeal. He has like 150 damage.
[7957.85s -> 7969.43s]  I gotta get in the menu and I gotta look at the controls. What is this? Battle keys? Oh here we go.
[7969.43s -> 7981.99s]  Dispel. I don't know what I'm even looking at here. All right. Dispel is... Wait. This is original
[7981.99s -> 8009.58s]  song. Original? It's X or A depending. It's probably X. I'll try that. Well I don't think
[8009.58s -> 8019.54s]  she's... I can't win now. I'll try X. Oh right. It's gonna be the clown music. Maybe I should
[8019.54s -> 8030.01s]  put it on read master. It sounds gonna be worse. Okay. This shouldn't be too bad. It's gonna be
[8030.01s -> 8042.76s]  horrible. I'm gonna lose. Guaranteed. Left and right. This is like putting your hands on an iPad.
[8048.06s -> 8054.97s]  So I... I'll try X. I'm gonna lose. There's no way I win this. Let's try the move though.
[8056.98s -> 8068.01s]  Try X. Is it X? It's not X. Is it B? Oh it's B. It's B. It's B. All right. No it's A. Okay good.
[8068.01s -> 8092.34s]  I got it now. Stay back. Pull back. It's like catching a fish. Again. Again again again again.
[8094.78s -> 8107.74s]  Again. How much gust does it take? I actually might win this. Push push push push push push push
[8107.90s -> 8145.02s]  push push push. Don't hurt me. I think we put this lady in the freezer. I gotta withdraw.
[8145.02s -> 8157.78s]  I gotta pull out. I gotta. I have to withdraw. I haven't won. No. Get out. Drop out. Drop out.
[8157.78s -> 8174.87s]  Drop out. There's no reason to do this. I'm gonna die. Drop out. Do an errand tree. I think it's
[8174.87s -> 8193.26s]  time to do an errand tree with her. I'm not giving up yet. No fans. That's fine. Don't spend your
[8193.26s -> 8205.37s]  money here. That's true because of like no encouragement. We're too soft. We keep making...
[8205.37s -> 8222.81s]  We spoil everybody. Sorry. Hold on. I don't need to read this. Sorry. I didn't mean to scare or
[8222.81s -> 8228.81s]  upset you with the voodoo comment. I won't keep you updated on it anymore. I want some... I want
[8228.81s -> 8232.89s]  some fucking warlocks in the chat right now. Whoever you are. You need to counter that person.
[8233.91s -> 8237.35s]  Don't update me. Don't tell me about it. But just make sure that you're like countering that person's
[8237.35s -> 8244.30s]  spells. Right? I want some like wizards. Like witches and warlocks. Just counter that person's
[8244.30s -> 8259.22s]  spell. Right? I will. Thank you. That person's casting spells on me. I don't... It's like a weird...
[8259.22s -> 8266.38s]  It's such a weird feeling. I don't want somebody to cast spells on me. And that like wouldn't it
[8266.38s -> 8278.15s]  make you feel like odd every day? I'll protect you. Okay. I just need some protect anti-magic
[8278.15s -> 8286.65s]  spells on me. All right. What do we do here? I'll tell you what we do. We're gonna go pee.
[8288.20s -> 8545.46s]  I will be right back. And we will continue. We're back. It is... It's like 85 degrees in this room.
[8545.46s -> 8568.50s]  You've washed your hands? Always. Always. Oh hey. Big pro tip. I'm eating something here.
[8568.50s -> 8580.04s]  I'll tell you right now. I used to not like cliff bars at all. But holy shit. The blueberry crisp
[8580.04s -> 8592.31s]  cliff bar. It cannot be compared to anything. It is so good. It's so good. Don't get the peanut
[8592.31s -> 8608.17s]  butter and chocolate meme bullshit. Blueberry crisp. Try it. I'm telling you. Chocolate mint.
[8608.81s -> 8623.14s]  No thank you. No thank you. I'll take blueberry crisp please. Want to see what it looks like? I
[8623.14s -> 8626.66s]  don't even know why it's called blueberry crisp. It's just good. This just tastes good.
[8627.30s -> 8643.93s]  I respect you a little bit less because of that statement. Nothing matters to me right now. I'm
[8643.93s -> 8659.62s]  eating a blueberry crisp cliff bar. All right. What are we doing? I kind of want to just freeze
[8659.62s -> 8670.36s]  her. I'll be honest. Cliff bar has gluten. What? What? What'd you say? Are you kidding me?
[8671.08s -> 8690.86s]  I'm gonna freeze her. I don't want it. Might be... Maybe later. Game's too loud. I gotta...
[8690.86s -> 8732.98s]  You're still eating it? They're good. Which one? The remastered one's a little more pleasant. This
[8732.98s -> 8749.40s]  one's a little harsher. Heard it off too. All right. Freeze. I don't want to... Somebody said
[8749.40s -> 8753.80s]  don't spend money. If I don't think I'm actually going to use this creature, I'm not going to spend
[8753.80s -> 8783.62s]  money on it. Maybe later. I need some more songs please. Rush? What's the song? The trouble with
[8783.62s -> 8795.48s]  the maples and they're quite convinced they're right. What's that song called? Trees. Yeah,
[8795.56s -> 8813.21s]  that's what I want. The trees, the sea, and the sun by Guy J. Sure. This is a big moment.
[8813.21s -> 8830.54s]  Something cool. It's kind of a weirdo. It's a thing inside of the people's heads in Men in Black.
[8830.54s -> 8867.50s]  Sorry if I spoiled a 30-year-old movie. Very energetic. All right. Eastie boys. How about,
[8868.22s -> 8907.21s]  how about Shake Your Rump? Shake Your Rump Remixed. Whoa. All right. What do we got here?
[8907.21s -> 8937.62s]  A bit scary looking, isn't it? All right. I think I can work. That's actually not bad. Space.
[8937.62s -> 8976.58s]  Love Batman. Let's go. It's a snake? All right. Sorry. I didn't know you were such an expert.
[8976.58s -> 8994.71s]  In Monster Ranger 2, monster types. What do you like? Oh, you like Cup Jelly. You don't like
[8994.71s -> 9009.66s]  potatoes. It's perfect. This hit percentage is awful. The whack and belly punch. D. Shit,
[9009.66s -> 9022.90s]  you kind of suck. I'm going to send this guy on an errand tree. What should we do? Just straight
[9022.90s -> 9084.14s]  up power? Yeah. No. Come on. Get back in there. Come on, dude. You can do it. Freeze. No. That
[9084.14s -> 9098.23s]  was pretty good for a baby. That was actually really good for a baby. He looks like you put
[9098.23s -> 9107.38s]  your action figure in the microwave. Maybe a little. What's going on here, by the way? I don't
[9107.38s -> 9127.24s]  like this part. You know what I'm saying? I don't like this part. See what I mean? Take a rest.
[9127.24s -> 9154.58s]  Shave it. F. Please do it. See if we can just kick people's asses. What's the next one? All right.
[9154.58s -> 9176.87s]  This one will be easy. We'll do this one for weeks. Get in there. You're freaking me out here.
[9176.87s -> 9189.98s]  Do it again. You like Cup Jelly, which is perfect. I have to make some money. I'm kind of just burning
[9189.98s -> 9213.58s]  through my five grand. What is it? We get some mail? I'm sending him. I'm sending him on an
[9213.58s -> 9237.51s]  errand tree. It's half off. Speed, life? What do they got? Speed, life, intelligence, life,
[9237.51s -> 9245.06s]  skill, life, power, life. This is the one. He's not going to gain anything, but he might learn a move.
[9245.62s -> 9262.73s]  He is too low, intelligence. Won't he potentially learn a move? He needs more hit chance. He needs
[9262.73s -> 9276.01s]  intelligence. I don't know. Just send him. Let him die. Who cares? How long you've been eating
[9276.01s -> 9281.37s]  at that single Cliff Bar? You don't know much about Cliff Bars. Cliff Bars can take sometimes
[9281.37s -> 9300.04s]  four hours to eat completely. They take 40 minutes to eat. They last an hour. It's so much nutrients
[9300.04s -> 9304.84s]  and protein packed in one cube. It takes a little while. You're trying to make me choke?
[9306.92s -> 9311.19s]  Maybe this is a stupid idea, but yeah, I don't have enough money. I really just don't.
[9311.99s -> 9319.99s]  Let's do a hit chance, which is skill, right? Let me see your data. Your skill is absolute dog
[9319.99s -> 9341.43s]  shit. All right, we'll do skill. Come on. You're cheating. Did you at least get points? You got
[9341.43s -> 9368.41s]  one point. Don't do that. Do it legitimately, please. Get in there. Don't cheat. Oh, come on.
[9368.41s -> 9387.59s]  You failed it? This guy's really just real dumb. I won't scold you this time. Back into the
[9387.59s -> 9402.06s]  microwave. Microwaved action figure. When's this fight? No, he's not ready. I might be ready for
[9402.06s -> 9405.42s]  the official cup if I can actually get you to do what you're supposed to do and stop screwing
[9405.42s -> 9438.44s]  around. Hit it. His skill is so bad. It's going to take so long to get him. Do it again. Get in
[9438.44s -> 9462.97s]  there and actually do it this time. You're wasting so many weeks. Stop it. Get in there and do it
[9462.97s -> 9478.33s]  the right way. Go get Bonnie back. I think we go get Bonnie. Bonnie's loyal, fast, strong,
[9478.33s -> 9487.74s]  intelligent, quick. I'm going to give this guy one more month if he's still annoying and we're
[9487.74s -> 9499.38s]  putting him into the ice. Got to give him at least one tournament. I know it's there. He's dressed
[9499.38s -> 9516.68s]  out. Oh shit. What the fuck was that? He got a weird scream. I like it. Eat a mint leaf. I could
[9516.68s -> 9535.70s]  sell it too. I could sell him in town. Fuse with noodle. I don't know if I want to fuse this guy
[9535.70s -> 9544.94s]  with the noodle. I'm going to do the battle this month. This one here. No, the E one. It's the
[9544.94s -> 9554.74s]  official one. I like that. I do like that sound effect though. I do like it. I'm buying two shit
[9554.74s -> 9560.54s]  monsters. It costs money. I think it's like 500 gold or something. I don't have enough money to
[9560.54s -> 9572.33s]  do that. I have to win a tournament. Please don't cheat and actually do it this time. This little
[9572.33s -> 9594.49s]  shit. I swear to God. Look at this terrible increase. It wins the battle. All right. We're
[9594.49s -> 9612.79s]  going to rest and then train and then rest. Do it for real this time. Please. Oh my fucking God.
[9612.79s -> 9631.22s]  Why can you not do any? Why? Well, let's see how good you are in a tournament. You need to ice
[9631.22s -> 9638.12s]  this dude. Not yet. He might, he might be really good in the tournament. He's unruly. He doesn't
[9638.12s -> 9655.13s]  listen, but what if he just KOs people in three hits? I'll try it. Let's go. We need money.
[9657.82s -> 9663.66s]  Like really badly actually. I'm going to start to burn too much money. If I go below a thousand
[9663.66s -> 9672.95s]  gold, then we have to just go get Bonnie and just try to just win tournaments. All right. What we
[9672.95s -> 9684.70s]  got? Same shitties that we saw last time. All right. Let's see what you got. Both these moves
[9684.70s -> 9691.99s]  are pretty bad. They're like probably 30% chance to hit. Uh, I don't, this doesn't look good.
[9692.47s -> 9711.50s]  42% chance to hit. This one does more damage though, doesn't it? Belly punch. Come on, do it.
[9711.50s -> 9727.08s]  Do it. That was, that was pretty good. That was actually really good. Belly punch is great. Stop.
[9727.08s -> 9753.66s]  Just close the gap here, please. Finally. Jesus. Just when who cares? You don't have to K or
[9753.66s -> 9783.40s]  everybody. Okay. Oh, I'm getting a headache. Trying to drink water. I'm going to literally
[9783.40s -> 9790.90s]  know like this game. End of the stream. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm very invested in this.
[9792.71s -> 9802.98s]  It's voodoo bullshit. Stop voodooing me. Uh, this I'm going to probably lose because this is power
[9802.98s -> 9811.38s]  versus power. Hmm. Hit chance is way more important sometimes than just power because I'm going to
[9811.38s -> 9815.40s]  miss half the things I swing at them. That's a cool profile picture though. I like the profile
[9815.40s -> 9838.38s]  picture for bug Batman. All right. We're going to get, come on. The, the, the whack has such a
[9838.38s -> 9847.70s]  terrible hit percentage. 51%. That's so bad. Why? No, don't do it. Holy shit. That was a lot. Don't
[9847.70s -> 9855.58s]  do anything but belly punches. No reason not to. She's just getting confused. All right.
[9856.22s -> 9878.87s]  I don't hate this guy. I do see a little bit of potential with a bug Batman. Probably going to
[9878.87s -> 9889.21s]  lose the one versus Oakley man though. Oakley man has lost once. Hopefully they lose twice.
[9889.85s -> 9901.56s]  Then we're good. I played this game my entire teens growing up. It's my favorite game of all time. So
[9901.56s -> 9905.18s]  happy you're playing it. This is probably one of the most fun games ever. I would put Monster
[9905.18s -> 9916.47s]  Rancher 2 somewhere in like the top 10. I'm really glad that they're supporting it still. Uh, I would
[9916.47s -> 9920.15s]  love for them to do another one. And by the way, steal this from me. If you want to do a Monster
[9920.15s -> 9925.43s]  Rancher 5 or like even if you did a Monster Rancher, just get rid of the numbers and just
[9925.43s -> 9930.55s]  make Monster Rancher. Right? Like everybody does now is you get too many high numbers,
[9930.55s -> 9940.30s]  you remake the whole thing, whatever. Make it URLs. URLs. Simple. I think that's a no brainer.
[9943.05s -> 9950.65s]  QR codes. I think that they have this system here that is song data. But you could just like
[9950.65s -> 9958.23s]  kind of just grab a shitload of website stuff and just have it be URL based. Either that or Steam
[9958.23s -> 9968.42s]  games or QR codes. Yeah, there's at least two or three ways to do it. Pornhub. I'm just saying
[9968.42s -> 9979.16s]  URLs would work. Do it from a photo on mobile. Yeah, there's so many cool things you could do.
[9979.16s -> 9993.37s]  I'm available. I'm available. All I ask for very, very basically, simply, is 60 to 70% of all the
[9993.37s -> 9998.04s]  gross sales. That's it. And that's like not even a big deal. That's not even like a high price to pay.
[9999.24s -> 10013.74s]  Like a fucking idea like that. It's not even like really that much. Good dodge. So if you're
[10013.74s -> 10018.78s]  wondering why the question marks keep popping up is the monster has low loyalty and is really young.
[10019.42s -> 10023.66s]  So when I tell it to do that move, as you see the little blue bar when it crosses over and I hit
[10023.66s -> 10028.22s]  the button, he's a little stupid. He's too young. He doesn't really know what I want him to do.
[10028.86s -> 10039.88s]  And he messes up, but holy shit does he hit hard. It's really hard. It's another win.
[10040.44s -> 10061.38s]  Hang on, I'm right here. One more. 47 damage. What a dumb fuck. It's like three months old.
[10062.68s -> 10071.14s]  He's two months old. Imagine like you have like a baby in your life, like an infant. I don't know
[10071.14s -> 10075.46s]  whether it's like a friend's or a family member's baby and you go over to the baby and the baby's
[10075.46s -> 10078.98s]  like kind of in the crib just like kind of giggling and laughing and shit and like people are like
[10078.98s -> 10085.82s]  shaking keys and you just lean in and say what a dumb fuck. You're not going to get invited to
[10085.82s -> 10093.93s]  Christmas again. I don't understand where you think you're coming from here. You're not going
[10093.93s -> 10102.33s]  to get invited to Thanksgiving. That's objectively true because your babies are stupid. That brain
[10102.33s -> 10113.85s]  hasn't even developed yet in the ring. So why are you playing a baby cage fighting game?
[10115.50s -> 10121.10s]  They're babies. They grow up. They're not babies forever. They're not just babies. They're little.
[10121.10s -> 10140.71s]  They grow up. They get big and strong. Why are you making babies fight each other? Oh yeah? Your
[10140.71s -> 10149.48s]  favorite game. Pocket Monsters. Pokemon. You throw this little fucking circle at these guys
[10150.04s -> 10159.42s]  and you trap them into this like 12 by like four by four inch cube. Do you see how these guys are?
[10159.42s -> 10167.48s]  They have like a big house. They're like out out in the grass and shit. The Pokeball that you're
[10167.48s -> 10181.72s]  trapping these Pokeballs. These Poke Monsters in there. It's a cube. It's a circle. Free-range
[10181.72s -> 10194.49s]  Pokemon. They like it in there. Okay. You're literally freezing a monster on a whim in this
[10194.49s -> 10209.06s]  game. Hold on. I got something important to do. Not bad. I think I might just run away now.
[10209.06s -> 10217.53s]  You get one more hit and run away and just let that time go up. That's bad. Give me an opportunity
[10217.53s -> 10233.69s]  to move. For god sakes. Come on. 66%. Oh my goodness gracious. I'm about to put this guy
[10233.69s -> 10240.25s]  in the fucking cooler where they'll get like the Pepsi's and the bottles of water. Hit punch.
[10246.07s -> 10259.45s]  Don't let them just zone you like that. Get in there. It's not good. Too much help. Whatever.
[10259.45s -> 10277.69s]  Would you eat a Pikachu egg? No. But I also I wouldn't eat anything besides a chicken egg.
[10281.51s -> 10292.79s]  Do Pikachu's have live birth? How does it work? The eggs? What do they come? What is it?
[10292.79s -> 10304.78s]  All Pokemons lay eggs. They do? Eggs? Even Wailord? Wailord is something like a gigantic egg?
[10305.34s -> 10324.66s]  It's because of the house? I don't. No. Wailord has live birth guys. I'm sorry. Wailord comes from
[10324.66s -> 10337.18s]  an egg. Ban this conversation. Like we can't talk about like the chicken and eggs and stuff.
[10340.98s -> 10345.46s]  Okay. Let me I want to make sure this is very clear to everybody. Me talking about Wailord's
[10346.18s -> 10355.72s]  eggs or birth whatever is not okay. But zooming in on my ass when I get up from the chair and like
[10355.72s -> 10364.63s]  look at his huge ass. That's okay. That's fine. I just want to be clear about what you got. What's
[10364.63s -> 10371.53s]  appropriate to you in the chat room. Don't talk about eggs. Don't talk about eggs. Zoom in on his
[10371.53s -> 10380.12s]  ass. Zoom in on his ass. Zoom in on his ass. That's which one's fine again. I'm just trying
[10380.12s -> 10405.34s]  to understand. All right let's beat this guy's ass. Do it again. Spring it together. Don't even
[10405.34s -> 10412.10s]  let him do anything. Be the first one to do the input. I don't have back it up. I don't have enough
[10412.10s -> 10426.30s]  guts. Spit. Back it up. Pull back. Run the clock out a little bit here. I don't want to lose. Punch.
[10426.30s -> 10437.66s]  That lick is a ton of damage too. I'm glad I didn't get hit by it. You just let these guys
[10437.66s -> 10446.20s]  spit in your face over and over again. You're really going to let them just do this again again
[10446.20s -> 10464.46s]  again again again. There it is. That actually might have been really bad. I love Swayzone.
[10464.46s -> 10477.08s]  I kind of want one of those guys. Oakley man. This is uh I think I'm going to lose the tournament.
[10477.88s -> 10490.54s]  All right come on Leon. Beat him. Come on. That's a victory right there. Tournament over. I won.
[10492.38s -> 10511.11s]  Nice. Nobody has four wins right? Nope. That's it. Hog Batman is the winner. Okay now I can't
[10511.11s -> 10524.74s]  freeze him because he just did an official cup right. Remember the Monster Rancher anime? I never
[10524.74s -> 10543.99s]  saw it. I never watched it. How do you get less fame than Arnie? Learn something from that. That's
[10543.99s -> 10553.93s]  pretty good. Those are good increases. Now just listen to me and just do what you're supposed to
[10553.93s -> 10564.52s]  do and you'll grow up really big and strong. Listen. Go. Don't cheat and just try to do a
[10564.52s -> 10575.59s]  little bit of work. Cup of jelly. Why are you playing two and not one? Um in my opinion two is
[10575.59s -> 10585.19s]  just the same game as one but more stuff to do. One's a little more direct I think. I think two
[10585.19s -> 10591.06s]  is a better game. As much as I love all of them. Besides the fourth one. The fourth one was awful.
[10596.36s -> 10603.40s]  Monster Rancher 4 was truly an unbearable game. It was awful. Oh is that wait is that Evo?
[10604.04s -> 10609.58s]  Evo. Which one? What's the bad? What's the really awful one? It's three four or Evo. I don't
[10609.58s -> 10619.40s]  remember which one it is. Well one of them is terrible. Evo is the bad one. I think whatever
[10619.40s -> 10624.98s]  the last one was made because that probably just I guess Capcom is probably just like
[10625.70s -> 10632.82s]  this is not even Capcom. I'm just saying of wrong company name. Whoops. Wait it wasn't a Capcom?
[10633.38s -> 10642.81s]  Who made this? Didn't Ko- Didn't Koei Tecmo make this? Wait didn't Capcom make the first one? I'm
[10642.81s -> 10657.03s]  so confused. Why do I think Capcom made the first one? I don't know. All right do it. Please don't
[10657.03s -> 10669.75s]  cheat. There it is. Oh my god you can't do this. You just can't do it. I don't think he's capable
[10669.75s -> 10679.42s]  of doing the skill based training without cheating. I don't I really don't think so. We've tried it
[10679.42s -> 10701.74s]  like seven times. I'm gonna try this one more time. Finally you actually did it. Good you got more
[10701.74s -> 10718.97s]  than one point. Shoot again. Uh I don't want to do this tournament. Bonus disc chips. Oh I think
[10718.97s -> 10723.53s]  those are actually worth having. I might try that. No maybe the next one. This one here.
[10724.55s -> 10733.22s]  Bonus magic banana. Two thousand gold. All right we're doing this one. Uh I want you to get more
[10733.22s -> 10759.62s]  power. Four thousand gold. Dude you're getting tablets next month. Tablets. Take the tablets.
[10759.62s -> 10768.26s]  Why is this thing such an asshole? Because it's got like bad nature and it's scary or whatever
[10768.26s -> 10780.02s]  right? So like it wants to cheat and evil or whatever. To do D rank we definitely we need
[10780.02s -> 10808.02s]  at least 180. You're just wasting all of my time and money. Oh you're tired. Are you tired? Come
[10808.02s -> 10817.46s]  here. Take a mint leaf and take a nut oil. You are killing him. I am not I'm not killing him. He's
[10817.46s -> 10839.66s]  failing at his task. This is a child. I'm trying to be. I'm trying. You can rest. He's a failure.
[10841.06s -> 10846.84s]  Not really because he just won a tournament. All right you're doing very well. You had some mint.
[10846.84s -> 10854.58s]  You had some tea. You had some delicious like sunflower oil. Now get in there and crush it.
[10855.53s -> 10870.62s]  Do it. I know you can. Now we praise. That's a big increase too. I think I get this 200 to 200.
[10870.62s -> 10879.34s]  Where's the one that's above four thousand gold? All right it's this one coming up.
[10879.34s -> 10882.52s]  Round robin. Four entries. I don't know if it's if he's strong enough.
[10890.06s -> 10905.42s]  Two thousand gold though. Should I try? I'll try it. Or do another E. I think I'm gonna go for it.
[10909.19s -> 10924.10s]  Rest up. Let's go. See if we can get you in the D rank. The f1 is 4k for jelly.
[10924.10s -> 10956.23s]  Let me go look at that again. It was 4,000. Everybody here? Our entry is cheaper. This one's
[10956.23s -> 10965.51s]  what are you seeing 4,000 gold from? No the only one that's here that's more than a thousand gold
[10965.51s -> 10981.26s]  is this one. I'm sending him on the trip. It was the f1s. I got uh I only have 1800 gold.
[10982.06s -> 10994.58s]  I don't know is it worth it? It's a thousand bucks. I'll have 800 dollars left. I'm gonna
[10994.58s -> 11000.92s]  soft block. I'm gonna soft block myself. Get in there. Come on. I know you got what it takes.
[11000.92s -> 11014.14s]  Let's go. I know you got what it takes. Get in there. If you don't you're getting you're getting
[11014.14s -> 11026.01s]  frozen. Spring rain. Under this condition para para's cup is about to start. Let's win. This is
[11026.01s -> 11036.04s]  gonna be a short tournament. There's only four entrants. Winston, Pella, and sleet bomb. Sleet
[11036.04s -> 11054.94s]  bomb. I think this guy has a lot. Oh okay. This is this is uh a war of I gotta hit him once and
[11054.94s -> 11065.05s]  then run away. Come in slow. Yeah. You idiot. Dodge. Good. No you're not an idiot. I was
[11065.05s -> 11078.57s]  kidding. I made it up. Get one hit and just good. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back
[11078.57s -> 11095.94s]  it up. Back it up. Nice job dude. Excellent work. Back. Back. Back. Dodge. Dodge. Oh he's good.
[11097.48s -> 11108.92s]  Dodge. Holy shit. This is so much RNG that's going in our favor here. Dodge. Dodge. No.
[11113.30s -> 11117.19s]  Just keep hitting him. Take win by percentages. He's so slow.
[11117.99s -> 11146.55s]  Oh shit. It's all right. All right. I gotta win this one. I'll get prize money if I come in
[11146.55s -> 11160.79s]  at least second or third place. This defense is so high. Isn't this an intelligence monster?
[11161.35s -> 11170.84s]  Well let's see. No it's not I guess. It's weird. Good start. Again. He just pissed him off. Great.
[11170.84s -> 11182.36s]  Do it again. Just unlock. Lock him up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up.
[11188.81s -> 11209.80s]  Good. Again. Oh what the fuck was that move? Oh my god. He cubed me. Yes. Can you please win? I
[11209.80s -> 11224.86s]  just did. Okay now I at least get some prize money. I need Winston to lose. I mean sleep bomb is the
[11224.86s -> 11245.56s]  favorite. What? You're not the favorite. What's so special about Winston? Oh. Dude this 86 health
[11245.56s -> 11254.23s]  100 power. This character sucks. Oh it's because it's intelligence moves. It's not a power. Okay
[11254.23s -> 11261.93s]  I have to. Here's the strategy. Get in close and just spam. I just gotta hit him a few times.
[11262.01s -> 11271.19s]  He doesn't even have intelligence moves. Look at his moves. He has all power moves.
[11271.83s -> 11276.82s]  Bro how you win. Bro. Bro how are you winning so many moves?
[11277.54s -> 11288.55s]  How did you win against the huge guy? Hey bro. Again. I win this. This is huge.
[11291.34s -> 11295.06s]  Stop getting confused. This is a big deal if I win.
[11303.50s -> 11312.52s]  Oh my god dude. Fucking hit him. Oh my god. Fucking hit him with one goddamn move you shitty guy.
[11313.48s -> 11348.87s]  You shitty guy. No. I still win. It doesn't kind of hurt to do that. I don't like this part.
[11348.87s -> 11355.90s]  Oh no. I have to fight him again. Wait a minute. This is three-way tie. All right.
[11355.90s -> 11370.60s]  Winston versus sleep bomb and sleep bomb wins. Sleep bomb. Okay tie breaker. Shit. I have whoever
[11370.60s -> 11387.30s]  wins this has to fight sleep bomb. Wait. Right? Nice v-neck. I beat him once I could beat him again.
[11387.30s -> 11392.89s]  I got really unlucky at the end there. My percentages just died for some reason.
[11392.89s -> 11400.07s]  Okay. Same strategy. Just gotta hit him a few times. Don't miss it. 36 percent. His speed is
[11400.07s -> 11421.24s]  so high. Here we go. Again. Just two more of those. Back up. Thank god you missed that because that
[11421.24s -> 11426.94s]  was an intelligence move that would have killed me by even one hit. Do not back up. Don't get in
[11426.94s -> 11457.53s]  range of that shit. Yes. Got him. Are we farming today? Farming what? What emote am I farming?
[11459.86s -> 11470.87s]  All right. Wow. How did I win? Dude that's 2,000 fucking gold. How did I just win that? Wasn't it
[11470.87s -> 11475.80s]  two and one? There were three people that were two and one. Did I win by more or something?
[11475.80s -> 11494.38s]  Higher seeds. Oh okay. 21. I was about to be bankrupt. Thank god. I got a magic banana. Okay.
[11494.38s -> 11506.07s]  What's a magic banana do? Oh we learned something. That's not bad. I would have liked to see health
[11506.07s -> 11519.19s]  in there but oh well. Good job. You're really powerful. You're just untrainable. Okay. What
[11519.19s -> 11540.65s]  have we got? Power. What's a banana do? I told you to leave it alone bug man. Do errantry. It's
[11540.65s -> 11556.06s]  gonna be two grand. Oh it's still the same month. All right. Power life. Is there skill? All right.
[11556.06s -> 11564.28s]  Do we go for the skill in life or do we go for power in life? Hit harder or be able to hit more
[11564.28s -> 11578.31s]  often? Skill. Errantry will take. Yeah this is somebody has an absolutely good advice here.
[11578.31s -> 11582.47s]  Errantry takes away from the monster's life. He doesn't have high enough stats yet to succeed
[11582.47s -> 11609.50s]  at the trials in it. Really? Send him anyway. Do you want to send your monster to this errantry
[11609.50s -> 11628.73s]  location? Wanted. Oh there's a wanted posters? Whoa. We probably should do the one with the E
[11628.73s -> 11653.62s]  right? Okay. We'll do the bunny. Okay. Let's go. This is important. All right. That was a nice spin.
[11653.62s -> 11665.62s]  He split it. He got it. That's a that's a success. He got it. Oh yeah. That's a lot.
[11668.62s -> 11686.09s]  Another one. Go for it. There's dog hair in my mouth. Land it. Oh that's gonna be a great
[11686.09s -> 11708.58s]  success. All right. He's a little sloppy but he made it. Hungry sharks. Nice. Watch out. He's good.
[11708.58s -> 11719.74s]  This is gonna be like a plus 20 skill. Come on make it. That's all right. That was a big one.
[11720.30s -> 11729.77s]  It's all right. That was a big one. Hungry sharks again. You can do it. One. Left side.
[11732.04s -> 11767.48s]  Even side. Handle it. Get him. No. Okay. What'd he gain like 12? 13 stats? You're too hard on it.
[11768.12s -> 11789.62s]  He's gonna pass out. What? Have some nut oil. Mint leaf is stress reduction. Nut oil is fatigue
[11789.62s -> 11799.83s]  reduction by the way. Rest. You tried. It was it says I'm soft. What do you mean too hard?
[11802.49s -> 11828.04s]  Let him rest. Oh my god. What happened? Not strong enough. We'll go for this one. That's too grand
[11828.04s -> 11838.26s]  in a gemini's pot. All right. I gotta get him get him trained up. All right. Is it time to begin
[11839.30s -> 11862.22s]  the hard training? Use that magic banana. These are big increases. Use magic. Its effect differs
[11862.22s -> 11872.52s]  each time you feed it to your monster. So what does it do? Remember this is not related to any
[11872.52s -> 11877.45s]  buddhist stuff. I was just curious about how your left ear is. Um that's actually kind of funny
[11877.45s -> 11880.65s]  that you say that because my left ear has been ringing for the last like six months. Thanks a
[11880.65s -> 11902.65s]  lot. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks a lot. I'm gonna hold it for now. All right. Those
[11902.65s -> 11909.66s]  of you uh lore masters. Is me doing these hard ones now worth doing even though they they're
[11910.46s -> 11928.87s]  very damaging? Is he old enough? How old are you? Six months old. He's still too still too young.
[11928.87s -> 11943.11s]  I don't know if he's matured yet. Do them but use a mint leaf. All right. I'm gonna see how I'm gonna
[11943.11s -> 11950.14s]  let's see how old if he's old enough. We're gonna do pole and then I'm gonna use a mint leaf. I'm
[11950.14s -> 11960.82s]  seeing. I'm curious. These add way more stats but they're really really taxing. You got it.
[11965.30s -> 11996.94s]  I'd say that's pretty damn good. You need skill. We'll do that after this. I know. I'm okay okay
[11996.94s -> 12022.36s]  okay. I need speed too. Rest up. How can you tell when he's going to pass away? Um depending on what
[12022.36s -> 12027.18s]  type of monster it is different monsters live longer. Because like I said there's base types
[12027.18s -> 12032.46s]  and then there's subtypes right? So this is a base type of whatever the snake monster is
[12033.02s -> 12042.62s]  and a subtype of something else. And they both have like the snake monster as all snake monsters
[12042.62s -> 12051.61s]  live for a base time of four years. Uh the uh like Swayzo lives for an average usually of three years
[12051.61s -> 12055.74s]  and it kind of just combines the two types. So some monsters live longer than others and then
[12055.74s -> 12064.04s]  stress and fatigue obviously weighs on it heavily too. This game might seem pretty simple but there's
[12064.04s -> 12073.88s]  a lot of in the background stuff that you need to be aware of. When's this battle? All right we're
[12073.88s -> 12095.38s]  gonna train and then we're gonna do power or skill. Skill. Go for it. Don't cheat. Good job. Plus five
[12095.38s -> 12110.01s]  at least. And you still use CDs you cannot. How the game handles it in this port is there's just
[12110.01s -> 12119.06s]  a gigantic database of hundreds of thousands of songs and CD data and you just pick it and
[12119.06s -> 12129.70s]  one comes out. And you see these nuts and then you laughed with all capitals. That's pretty good.
[12129.70s -> 12147.10s]  All right we need that we need that two grand. Oh what a fucking classic. All right here we go.
[12147.10s -> 12159.80s]  Two thousand gold in a gemini's pot. Let's see if I can win this one.
[12159.80s -> 12168.92s]  Why are you doing the black tourmaline copypasta? All right let's go for it.
[12168.92s -> 12175.86s]  Quick tournament. Only four. Paramar. Capella. All right we've seen Capella.
[12177.14s -> 12197.69s]  Millium. Good luck bug Batman. I just gotta hit you like once. Twice. It shouldn't be too bad.
[12198.25s -> 12208.74s]  Stay close. This is an intelligence monster. Again stun lock. Oh it's 33. It's a one in three chance
[12208.74s -> 12230.33s]  to hit right now. Stay close. Literally four damage. Who cares. Easy. Stay close. Come on.
[12230.33s -> 12252.12s]  28% chance to hit. I just dropped my guts. 50% chance to hit. Oh I'll just fine. I'll just win
[12252.12s -> 12259.30s]  by. It doesn't matter. You can't even hurt me. Okay that's fine. Just keep doing no damage.
[12259.30s -> 12275.43s]  Whatever. I'm still lost. I just got angry. All right that's good. That at least potentially
[12275.43s -> 12285.00s]  guarantees us some prize money. Why is German a bad mood? What? I'm not a bad mood. What are
[12285.00s -> 12289.00s]  you talking about? I'm having fun just hanging out playing the game. I'm not a bad mood. What
[12289.00s -> 12301.37s]  are you talking about? Bad mood. What? How come you're not doing anything funny? Why do I have to
[12301.37s -> 12310.76s]  do something funny? I'm enjoying my favorite game of all time when I was 16. It's because he's so
[12310.76s -> 12326.42s]  red. What did I do about Smug? What did I do? He hates streaming. What did I do? I didn't do
[12326.42s -> 12347.58s]  anything. I didn't do anything. Good. Stay back. Watch out for that thing. He does that dice thing
[12347.58s -> 12355.51s]  and it does like 50 damage. Don't let him dice you. This motherfucker needs a new move so bad.
[12359.74s -> 12386.89s]  What the fuck was that? Dude will you attack him? That's not enough right?
[12399.80s -> 12405.32s]  He's redder than Boston baked beans? Baked beans are like what are you talking about? They're not
[12405.32s -> 12413.70s]  red. Those are like regular baked beans. Regular beans. Are beans? Yeah they are red. Boston baked
[12413.70s -> 12428.46s]  beans. This little guy. I just made 100k. Well you're going to lose this next one because I'm
[12428.46s -> 12440.66s]  going to... His defense is so bad. As long as I can hit him. A little like owl. I just have to land
[12440.66s -> 12457.53s]  it. We gotta just focus only on skill. Here we go. Good. Stay back. Again. Back it up. Push him back.
[12458.09s -> 12477.37s]  All right. He doesn't hurt at all. That's fine. Guard. Good job. Why are they booing that?
[12478.01s -> 12489.46s]  That was a cool move. I need two wins. Really? I mean a three. Don't even...
[12490.58s -> 12499.59s]  Okay we're good. Go for the kill shot here. Kill. Get more points. Everyone's fucking booing me.
[12500.47s -> 12516.68s]  Why do you look like Woody Harrelson? I'll tell you. He's going to be carnage. I remember when I saw
[12516.68s -> 12521.67s]  that. I was thinking that was awful. Well let me just tell you something. He's going to be carnage.
[12530.17s -> 12538.94s]  All right. Rematch. This is for two grand. All right. I can do this as long as I can get the hits.
[12538.94s -> 12550.31s]  I can't believe this. Yeah. I can't believe Capella lost that. I just have to get lucky here.
[12551.51s -> 12557.13s]  Capella's stats are so much better than mine in every conceivable way. I have to get lucky.
[12563.34s -> 12574.82s]  All right. Exactly what I wanted to have happen. Again. Do it again. Again. Again. Again. Again.
[12575.98s -> 12600.73s]  60% chance. Getting close. 41. Don't do the cube. I'll just stay back. Whatever. I'm just going to
[12600.73s -> 12610.20s]  play like a coward. This is for the championship. Well the money. Oh my god. That hurt so much.
[12617.78s -> 12650.26s]  That was so stupid. He couldn't even move. God damn it. At least I get to make the
[12650.26s -> 12671.74s]  errantry money back. Okay. All right. Not terrible. I got to get that over 200 power
[12671.74s -> 12683.22s]  and then I'm setting an errantry again. You did a good job. You're okay. Is it half off errantry?
[12688.22s -> 12695.51s]  Tablets. Can you do Tommy Lee Jones? Yeah. That's right.
[12699.02s -> 12739.43s]  How much is errantry? Stop drugging. I'm not. It's nutrient pills. What the fuck?
[12739.43s -> 12744.55s]  Why are you calling me a druggy? What? Dude, you're a druggy. What do you mean a druggy?
[12744.55s -> 12752.49s]  No. The joke there was why do you want me to do a Tommy Lee Jones impression?
[12752.49s -> 12760.73s]  I can't tell you the last Tommy Lee Jones movie that I watched. Take your vitamins.
[12764.30s -> 12772.31s]  All right. We're doing. What's next? A thousand bucks. Two thousand bucks. This is the one we're
[12772.31s -> 12781.14s]  going to win and then we're going to move up to C rank. Okay. So how are you doing right now?
[12781.14s -> 12800.38s]  Should we do errantry? Come on. You can do it. Two thousand dollars, dude. Is this stupid? Go for it.
[12800.38s -> 12846.47s]  Go. Do it. Do it. Let's see it. Is he going to die to the sharks again? He's better than he was
[12846.47s -> 12862.09s]  before. Clean landing. Clean landing. I want to play this game so bad now. It's really good.
[12863.24s -> 12868.04s]  You get both of them. You get one and two. This is the big kicker right here. Let's get ourselves
[12868.04s -> 12887.61s]  a new technique. Turn around. Turn around. Whack him. Fucking idiot. Here's another chance.
[12888.17s -> 12912.38s]  This side. Come on. Do it. Turn around. Get him. Oh my God. Why? Come on. You were so close.
[12913.34s -> 12948.84s]  He's too grand. He's too young. Now I only have a thousand dollars left. He's got 44 loyalty. All
[12948.84s -> 12966.62s]  right. Rest. Take some stress reduction. You've spoiled him and you're too hard on him. Yeah.
[12966.62s -> 12983.53s]  How does that make any sense? How much for you to stream the thing again? I stream the whole thing.
[12983.53s -> 13001.42s]  Go for it again. I need to. I have to make at least a little bit of money. This is two thousand
[13001.42s -> 13008.97s]  dollars, which means if I come in second place, I get a thousand bucks. You're going to stop
[13008.97s -> 13026.36s]  providing your kids with alternative medicine. All right. This is not bad because the big
[13027.26s -> 13060.17s]  weird dog muppet thing is not here. Come on. It's all right. Bounce. Bounce it.
[13063.03s -> 13079.34s]  Get angry. That's good. Get angry. Use it. Will you use your anger? Use that anger. Dodge it.
[13079.34s -> 13082.86s]  Holy shit. That's so clutch. That would have been awful if I got hit by that.
[13093.06s -> 13119.35s]  Dodge it. Why are you voting? Why are you rooting against me? We can beat this,
[13120.07s -> 13142.73s]  this little owl thing. I beat it last time. Staying close. Bingo. All right. Again. 68%
[13142.73s -> 13148.57s]  chance. Come on. That hurts a lot, but it's not that big of a deal. As long as I can spring
[13148.57s -> 13152.49s]  with you together. Your skill is so bad. Put them on ice. I'm done. I'm done with this guy. He's
[13152.49s -> 13171.43s]  getting frozen. He heard me say that. Now he's going to be hit way more. Go back. 62% chance.
[13171.43s -> 13186.41s]  You still can't hit him. What are you swinging at? What are you swinging at? Thank you. Thank you.
[13186.41s -> 13201.91s]  Knock him out. That's back to back 60%. 60 is really not that high. If you want to hit more
[13201.91s -> 13207.22s]  often, save up your guts. The more guts you have in the bank, the more accurate and powerful the
[13207.22s -> 13212.58s]  move is. Yeah, I heard that too, but this early though, I feel like you have to get hits in.
[13213.22s -> 13230.86s]  That might be the complete wrong strategy. He moved it. Moved it. All right. Capella wins, but
[13231.82s -> 13234.62s]  I can still come in second place if I beat Winston, who has lost twice.
[13236.73s -> 13246.82s]  I'll get a thousand bucks out of this. Stay away from that ice breath move and I will be fine.
[13246.82s -> 13257.62s]  Stay in close. That's all right. That's fine. I mean, if you weren't just such a dumb ass and
[13257.62s -> 13267.54s]  just every single move, you just don't know where you are. Again, can we start eating
[13267.54s -> 13324.89s]  Wheaties for breakfast? Why are you second place? Get it. Hit him. Fucking swing at him. What
[13324.89s -> 13339.86s]  happened? Oh, my controller unplugged. That's why I couldn't swing at him. That's very interesting.
[13345.32s -> 13359.74s]  I have it plugged into because this cord is small, so it's plugged into an extender that
[13359.74s -> 13379.22s]  goes to the computer under there. Oops. Do I get any money at all? Who even won? Did I get money
[13379.22s -> 13396.26s]  for that? $50. That's not even going to cover the expenses. That's not even going to cover
[13396.34s -> 13407.03s]  like the medicine. I gained one fan. Oh, that sucks. Keep going like this. Like,
[13408.70s -> 13412.54s]  my head's not itchy. It's just like a nervous habit. I don't know why I'm doing that.
[13412.54s -> 13436.28s]  Did you not learn anything? The monkey seems pretty tired. Go ahead and rest. It's time to go take a
[13436.28s -> 13443.00s]  look for another monster. If you consider dandruff shampoo, my head's fine. It's not itchy. I'm just
[13443.00s -> 13448.10s]  like my fingers need somewhere to go. Whenever I'm sitting around, if I'm doing something that I'm
[13448.10s -> 13453.61s]  really interested in and really like intensely focused on, like my hand will just like have a
[13453.61s -> 13458.17s]  mind of its own and just like go and move to different places and like move around.
[13458.89s -> 13475.02s]  Like I'm not in control of his hand. It's just like, just like up here. ADHD. Yeah. I mean,
[13475.02s -> 13481.80s]  that's probably what it is. You're a fidgeter. I am a big fidgeter. You're right. Told you.
[13482.60s -> 13491.37s]  All right. He's almost a year old. It's time to, let's get some training here, please.
[13494.33s -> 13505.37s]  Vigorous training. I'm doing the powerful drill. We're doing skill. There's nothing that's
[13505.37s -> 13512.58s]  powerful skill is there. Speed, power, intelligence and defense. There's this one,
[13512.58s -> 13554.92s]  but I don't want intelligence. Power. Power. Go. I need money. Bad. Can you please? Who is it?
[13554.92s -> 13563.18s]  It's going to be Erentree, isn't it? I wasted the last month. I did this and wasted money.
[13563.18s -> 13585.69s]  It's Erentree. God damn it. Crap. This is a thousand bucks. I'm just going to go here and just
[13585.69s -> 13592.63s]  win. Rest. I need that thousand dollars. We're going to go, we're going to drop down a rank
[13592.63s -> 13622.41s]  and just kill people. Smurf. This monster is miserable. He's not even miserable. Combine
[13622.41s -> 13626.81s]  this guy with Barney. I'm scared to do that because what if we get a shitty combination?
[13631.42s -> 13643.42s]  How much can you say? Yeah. You know what? Let's find out how much I can sell. Welcome.
[13643.42s -> 13650.86s]  Okay. What would you like to do? Sell. You pay a hundred gold for your monster. What a
[13650.94s -> 13661.51s]  low ball offer that is. A hundred gold. That's, that's nothing. Give me a break.
[13666.25s -> 13671.37s]  Back to the ranch. I'm giving this guy one more opportunity. We're going to take him.
[13672.18s -> 13685.37s]  We're going to do Erentree. First, we're going to drill. I'm going to do the easy
[13685.37s -> 13696.47s]  tournament. Just try to get some money. Be glad she's paying anything for something so worthless.
[13699.83s -> 13709.18s]  Skill is actually increasing. When is that one? All right, let's go. Let's just go wipe the floor
[13709.18s -> 13722.57s]  with a bunch of low level Smurfs. Wait, what did that say? Do I care? I don't know if I care.
[13735.48s -> 13745.18s]  I'm going to lose subs for this. Monster pups cup. I'm fighting actually literally children.
[13751.05s -> 13764.71s]  That had like a little cartoon children's intro. Okay. How much fame do I lose? They have better
[13764.71s -> 13785.74s]  stats than I do. How am I going to lose fame? Why are you still doing an E rank? Dude, this
[13785.74s -> 13792.36s]  character is E rank. I can't hit anybody. I've been hammering skill for the last like three
[13792.36s -> 13802.98s]  months and I can't even hit anybody. I'm not losing to children yet. Okay. I'm losing slightly
[13802.98s -> 13826.42s]  to children. Oh my fucking God. I'm going to lose. Dodge something. Dodge it. There it is.
[13826.42s -> 13852.63s]  Percentage as I win. Thank you. You guys are betting on every single match. I wonder how many
[13852.63s -> 13869.91s]  guys are just losing over and over again. This one should be easy. I got this. Let's build some
[13869.91s -> 13878.12s]  guts up. Let's try that strategy because right now it's like a 40% chance to hit. But I don't
[13878.12s -> 13883.35s]  just want to farm guts while he beats the shit out of me. Still at, okay, we're at 80 guts.
[13885.43s -> 13889.66s]  We're at a four. That's something like that. We're at almost a hundred guts.
[13890.30s -> 13903.98s]  I'm not sure it's worth doing that. I gotta hit him. That was big. If you bet against this,
[13903.98s -> 13925.35s]  I don't know what the hell you were doing. It's all right. Is the equivalent of sending an 11
[13925.35s -> 13933.59s]  year old to a kindergarten karate tournament and not being sure about the win? Well, I'm pretty
[13933.59s -> 13940.10s]  sure of it now unless the bunny, if the bunny loses here, it's over. That's it. I'll take the
[13940.10s -> 13951.13s]  victory. Wait. No, this is the victory. I have to win this. This bunny had 50 health. It's going to
[13951.13s -> 13957.67s]  be so simple. Don't worry. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to keep. Okay. Ready? If you bet against this,
[13958.23s -> 13980.89s]  I want to bet for me right now. Staying close. The rabbit has no moves up close. I can just try to
[13980.89s -> 13995.62s]  keep the zone here and let's go for it again. Stay in there. Stay in there. Don't let him close
[13995.62s -> 14018.06s]  the gap. What would you, what are you thinking? Wrapped and clapped and try to kill him.
[14018.78s -> 14029.64s]  All right. That's a thousand bucks and an item too. I think the little disc chips you,
[14029.64s -> 14043.08s]  when you combine monsters, you use a disc chip and it adds stats. I think pretty sure. What do
[14043.08s -> 14052.39s]  you think? We have to wait till I can at least get this guy another skill. He's winning tournaments.
[14064.47s -> 14086.74s]  Disc chips and learn something too. All right. I need to get 200 power. Oh, let's praise him. Sure.
[14086.74s -> 14114.74s]  My eye. Okay. Make sure to blink. All right. We're getting there. It's almost time. Give the
[14114.74s -> 14134.02s]  banana. All right. It's banana time. I don't even know what this does. Eat the banana. What did that
[14134.02s -> 14157.45s]  do? What did that do? It didn't do anything. Loyalty went down, but banana trades fatigue for
[14157.45s -> 14182.90s]  lifespan. Did I just make him die faster? That's not good. Crap. Go learn another move. Power to
[14182.90s -> 14199.53s]  200. I got, he's got to learn another move. Get rid of him. This is a, he's a loss.
[14200.41s -> 14220.09s]  I don't think so yet. We got two of these now. Okay. Aaron tree. How much does it cost? It's
[14220.09s -> 14227.18s]  2000. It's wait. No, it's not. It's a thousand. Come on, dude. What? It went back. I thought it
[14227.18s -> 14241.51s]  was still, oh, it's a different month. One monster Andy. I need to get somebody up to at least a year
[14248.09s -> 14277.13s]  level up power. Thank you. When is this battle? Should I go for C? No, not yet. I want to
[14277.13s -> 14283.58s]  participate in attorney and fight next week. This is what I mean next week. There's no fight next
[14283.58s -> 14323.27s]  week. Is there? Yes. I don't remember the being one. No, there's none. Sorry. You can't. 57. I
[14323.27s -> 14354.65s]  think it's time that I go power and I'm not doing enough damage to people. Our again does over 50
[14354.97s -> 14361.26s]  a hit and complains about damage. Oh, he's probably, he's kind of hired and he's not.
[14363.02s -> 14370.28s]  All right, let's do it. Rank D. I should, yeah. Rank D. I should just wait and take him to F.
[14370.28s -> 14394.94s]  What do you guys think? I will get crushed in C. He needs to get older. He needs to actually go
[14394.94s -> 14409.46s]  into the like adolescent stage, which is between what? One and two years. All right. We have not
[14409.46s -> 14424.58s]  seen one of these people yet. Just stay in close. Don't get hit by the ice ball and kill. That was
[14424.58s -> 14435.40s]  very, very good. I'll just hold it together. Don't be too crazy. Let the guts build up. Good. Go for
[14435.40s -> 14467.43s]  it. Clean. Very clean. Be an idiot. Do not choke on Capella. I, I'm going to try to play it safe.
[14467.43s -> 14499.98s]  I'll lose. Nice. Hail fall. Okay. I, Millium has 40 health. Let's do it. When are you going to peep
[14499.98s -> 14507.38s]  the horror? When is the game, when is he going to pee? I don't know what that means. All right. Stay
[14507.46s -> 14549.32s]  in close. Build up the guts. Come on. Really? Combo again. Shit. Good. All right. Now don't
[14549.32s -> 14571.90s]  be moron. Don't be moron. Go back. All right. Can I swing once? Get in there. All right. I win.
[14571.90s -> 14590.33s]  Hopefully I gave him the fame back if I win. Joe Biden called me cringe in his latest appearance.
[14590.89s -> 14603.59s]  That guy is just so cringe. By executive order, I'm going to make it so it's illegal for him to
[14603.59s -> 14609.66s]  stream. He's the cringiest damn guy I've ever seen. Imagine if I had something like a president
[14609.66s -> 14623.26s]  like executive order for me to not scream. What would I even do? It's a cringe tax. I have to pay
[14623.26s -> 14631.43s]  a cringe tax. I have to pay an extra 10% of my income to the cringe tax. That's so stupid.
[14631.99s -> 14650.52s]  All right. This guy lost twice. I can handle it. Get in close. I think it's cool looking though.
[14661.24s -> 14672.92s]  Don't get stabbed. I feel like that thing hurts. I'm getting really greedy here.
[14689.56s -> 14718.26s]  Hit him. Hit him. Hit him. Okay. Time's up. That was close. Is this for GameCube? This is for Steam
[14718.26s -> 14722.82s]  and Switch right now. You can get it right now. It's a double bundled Monster Rancher one and two.
[14724.26s -> 14755.62s]  It's a doozy. Explain how Millium is winning any matches. All right. Let's take it home.
[14764.71s -> 14772.71s]  Bad intelligence is so high. Get in close. Holy shit. You actually got it off. It's okay.
[14773.43s -> 14784.62s]  It doesn't matter. Your moves are so bad. Just don't let her get any range. I can take six
[14784.62s -> 14788.30s]  damage a thousand times. It doesn't matter. Build the guts up. I just have to punch her once in the
[14788.30s -> 14819.22s]  face. Oh, you motherfucker, please. Oh, I got her. So that's definitely how she's winning matches.
[14820.02s -> 14831.61s]  She's ranging. I'm just trying to stay back. I'm just winning by countdown. All right. It's
[14831.61s -> 14847.40s]  now impossible for me to lose. Actually not possible to lose now. Tournament one. Oh,
[14847.40s -> 14851.00s]  make sure you tune in tomorrow for the game awards. I'll be live during the game awards.
[14852.49s -> 14858.74s]  And then after the game awards, I'm probably going to play this again because I want to play
[14858.74s -> 14877.67s]  it again. This one's just for fun. What time is the game awards? 430 Pacific? Oh, three o'clock
[14877.67s -> 14900.76s]  Pacific. Maybe four o'clock Pacific. Maybe five. I can lose this fight. It's okay. Combo. Combo.
[14900.76s -> 14917.06s]  Again. Combo. Again. Knockout. All right. This is a win. Stay back. Watch that stupid thing.
[14917.86s -> 14955.88s]  I could really get carried away here and die. Yes. Perfect score. I'll take it. That should get a
[14955.88s -> 14967.78s]  lot of fame for this then. At least five to 10 fame. I hope these mobile controls look like ass.
[14970.12s -> 14976.84s]  I would imagine this actually would be terrible with a mouse. I mean, maybe you do left and right
[14976.84s -> 14988.39s]  on the arrow keys or W-A-A. It feels a little weird. With a controller, this is fine. It plays
[14988.39s -> 15003.64s]  just like it did 20 years ago. Prop the source. Yeah, there's to be black bars, right? Wow. That's
[15003.64s -> 15014.68s]  pretty huge. Wow. That's actually a big deal. Nice. I know I can't freeze them because now
[15014.68s -> 15027.08s]  his stats are going to be really good soon. Where's Beanbag Sonic? We'll probably see Beanbag
[15027.08s -> 15042.06s]  Sonic soon. Maybe not. It's all that kind of random. Is this emulated? No, this is on Steam
[15042.06s -> 15053.74s]  right now. Came out four and a half hours ago. Express mail from IMA. Next, this is it. What?
[15054.30s -> 15066.55s]  What is it? Here we go. This is my official license. Got rank two. All right. Does that
[15066.55s -> 15075.98s]  mean I can actually get toxic from Britney Spears? Second rank. Today is Bug Batman's birthday.
[15076.70s -> 15086.76s]  Should we sing happy birthday? Me, me, me, me. Oh, that was not what that was. Happy birthday
[15087.72s -> 15095.48s]  to, happy to you. Happy birthday Bug Batman. Why? You can't even get a fucking license?
[15096.71s -> 15108.86s]  Grow and be a strong monster. Hope that didn't cost money. How is my song? Not bad, huh? You
[15108.86s -> 15118.68s]  didn't even sing happy birthday. Are you from a different planet? Imagine trying to search in
[15118.68s -> 15129.83s]  your head for a song to sing someone on a happy birthday. On somebody's birthday. I would love to
[15129.91s -> 15140.01s]  sing you something, but I'll make something up on the spot. It's a happy birthday. Warner Music
[15140.01s -> 15148.97s]  invoices the copyright on a happy birthday since 1949. But they know they don't. Oh, there's a big
[15148.97s -> 15162.38s]  cake. Take this to our monster. Here, take this to our monster, Joy. Big birthday cake. It's DMCA.
[15173.22s -> 15186.47s]  Rest up. And then we're sending you on an errand trip. Is it worth doing this now?
[15187.19s -> 15194.82s]  Or should I do some heavy training? I'm doing heavy training with power. I'm curious. I think
[15194.82s -> 15206.30s]  it's going to be all right. Go for it. Make it happen. Get up there. Come on. Really?
[15208.25s -> 15212.89s]  You just had a big birthday cake and pills and everything and you can't go up the hill.
[15213.69s -> 15232.86s]  Try it again. I want to get you into the next C tournament. I want to participate in an attorney
[15232.86s -> 15253.42s]  and fight next week. I don't even know if there's a tournament next week. Can I see? What? Um,
[15253.42s -> 15265.24s]  you made it. All right. Good. All right. Big increases now. Huge increases. That's like,
[15265.24s -> 15284.41s]  that's a lot. I'm going to keep doing it. What does this peak the horror thing? I don't even
[15284.41s -> 15316.65s]  know what that is. Oh, again, another 20 stats. Well, technically did it. That was cheeky. Food.
[15316.65s -> 15328.47s]  We're going to do a cup of jelly. Stress reducer. It's a reference to a dream someone had about you
[15328.47s -> 15346.49s]  had blew up on Tumblr. What? It's a dream someone had about you. There's a comic book about it.
[15346.49s -> 15383.45s]  What? I need to buy some more mint leaves. Read the comic. Okay. Um, I just read this?
[15389.77s -> 15393.70s]  Okay. I'm just going to read this. I had a dream last night.
[15394.26s -> 15399.67s]  Derma became like a mainstream celebrity by pioneering a new type of stream where he would
[15399.67s -> 15406.94s]  play a game like normal. But every once in a while he'd let chat peep the horror and put this like
[15406.94s -> 15414.09s]  red and black pulsating mass on screen. Kind of look like an AI generated image. And the whole
[15414.09s -> 15419.61s]  deal was that everyone who saw it thought it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen. But every time
[15419.61s -> 15427.91s]  he'd show it, one viewer who saw it would die. It ended when he showed it on stream and dropped dead.
[15427.91s -> 15437.35s]  The stream was left on for 72 hours to honor his memory. It was dead quiet with just his body and
[15437.35s -> 15459.38s]  a slowly pulsating red mass on screen beside him. What? That's a fucked up. Whoa. That's
[15459.38s -> 15473.67s]  what it looks like? Hold on. That's so scary. But I'm the one that died? Not lucky, man.
[15473.67s -> 15504.46s]  What's with that RNG? Oh, Popeye's Prize! No, don't show that! That's it. That's it right there.
[15504.46s -> 15520.84s]  All right. Nobody can believe you. What? I need to read this one more time. One more time.
[15524.50s -> 15529.62s]  Why does his face look like this? Hello? Is he all right? All right. I'm like freaking me out. I don't
[15529.62s -> 15545.90s]  show this anymore. So somebody would just die. There's more. So it was this weird sort of
[15546.62s -> 15555.70s]  strange god scary kind of other sort of old one power where we all it like hit us and like
[15555.70s -> 15561.96s]  fucked up our brains and we thought it was really funny. Keep the horror. That's actually really
[15561.96s -> 15575.38s]  crazy. Okay. Hello. Welcome. I hear that Jax achieved the second rank. Keep on going. You work
[15575.38s -> 15586.98s]  hard. I would like to buy. They hate the smoke snake. Supposed to make it so they're not spoiled
[15586.98s -> 15619.26s]  anymore. So much money. I'll buy two. Feed the snake a snake. No. Go for it again. Pull. Get up
[15619.26s -> 15643.83s]  there. Get up there. Beat the horror please. I know you can do it. I want to participate in
[15643.83s -> 15651.86s]  a tourney and fight next week. Sure. You can fight next week. But if there's no tournament you're
[15651.86s -> 15672.46s]  gonna have to fight me. Dude. I even. Wasting time. Jax didn't you make a promise that Bog Batman will
[15672.46s -> 15717.00s]  enter a tournament? Oh he's really tired. He's too tired to do this. What should I do? Just let him
[15717.00s -> 15735.18s]  rest. He's gonna be pissed that I didn't let him do the thing. Loyalty went down. Well maybe if you
[15735.18s -> 15741.50s]  did one of these correctly we wouldn't have to waste all this time. I want to do a tournament
[15741.50s -> 15755.10s]  and fight next week. No. You're not ready to do any tournaments. Actually not ready. Thank you. All
[15755.10s -> 15773.32s]  right. Now I will listen to your requests. 17. Nice. Very nice. Very nice. This month I think we're
[15773.32s -> 15793.64s]  gonna go with a tablet. Just watch the video. Do a tablet every first week. Nut oil every second
[15793.64s -> 15804.73s]  week. From now on Bog Batman's strength will be affected depending upon how we raise it.
[15805.61s -> 15823.30s]  We must use more training skills. All right this is it. This is where we get him to like three or
[15823.30s -> 15848.54s]  four hundred power. Go for it. Go for it. You can't. No. I'm sorry I just punched everybody.
[15848.54s -> 15852.97s]  I gotta move the mic. I'm an idiot. I'm so sorry. All right let's see a huge increase here please.
[15860.79s -> 15873.16s]  I want him at 300 attack. Do it again. One more. One more of these and then that's it.
[15877.26s -> 15898.87s]  No. And then I'll do speed to get it back up. All right. Rest rest rest rest. I'm doing too much
[15898.87s -> 15909.35s]  work. What's the next battle? Should I? I should try C. I'm going for it. He's got a lot of power.
[15925.62s -> 15930.50s]  You need another move besides like punch and scratch. I need you to have something else to do.
[15931.14s -> 15952.78s]  I can go up to B rank. No thanks. C. Let's go. Why are you so serious? Be funny. Not serious.
[15953.66s -> 15974.86s]  Man that person for 700 years. All right let's go. Oh by the way. Human years. That's a move that is.
[15974.86s -> 15987.05s]  Oh as opposed to gerbil years. Oh this is big. There's a lot of people in this one.
[15988.52s -> 16002.38s]  Oh shush. Shush. Shush. I can't wait to kill this guy in two hits. All right this is uh
[16002.38s -> 16026.86s]  uh 366 kill. Get the fuck out of here. Are you serious? Power punch in the stomach.
[16031.64s -> 16063.46s]  Come on. Good. Again. What? Holy shit. He killed me in one hit. That's not cool.
[16070.28s -> 16084.66s]  I want one of those like handsome rock people. All right. Who am I going against?
[16085.22s -> 16093.62s]  I might have to pull out. Oh yeah. No way. C is not going to. This is not going to happen.
[16093.62s -> 16117.42s]  This was a stupid idea. This is a stupid idea. I could get lucky though. No way. I'm out. I'll
[16117.42s -> 16123.46s]  get. He'll die. He'll actually die from this. Holy shit. Okay just kill me so I can leave.
[16124.10s -> 16173.06s]  He's gonna die. He's gonna fucking die. He's gonna die. I gotta leave. Susvane's gonna win
[16173.06s -> 16199.58s]  the whole thing. Close. Get out. It's not worth it. Waranmo is the one to beat. Do I get a fame?
[16199.90s -> 16205.26s]  I don't get a dollar for showing up. Do I get any fame for showing up?
[16224.63s -> 16254.84s]  Oh no. Freeze him. He's ready to train. I can't. Not yet. He's in the prime right now for me to get
[16254.84s -> 16279.66s]  like a shitload of stats on him. Just splice him. Just hold on. Just a regular skill. Stop cheating.
[16279.66s -> 16284.44s]  You're just messing this whole thing up. All right if he does it again he's getting frozen.
[16285.00s -> 16317.03s]  You're the lower attorneys? Yeah. Get in there. Good job. Maybe if you raised your kids right.
[16328.92s -> 16347.03s]  All right. F. Oh what do we have here? A new year cup? Is it worth doing? It's a lot of money.
[16355.22s -> 16370.06s]  What rank is this? Just F rank? But who can participate? Anybody? A new year cup.
[16370.06s -> 16407.18s]  Game just crashed. When was the last time it saved? Right. That was weird. Okay continue. Use the data
[16407.18s -> 16425.40s]  to load. Monster bug. Yeah this is literally like right here. There it is. All right so let's try
[16425.40s -> 16453.34s]  that again. I love this game. Okay don't crash. Oh it's a tournament. Like actual tournament.
[16455.37s -> 16461.83s]  How how how are these guys strong? Oh my goodness. They're like look at how they look. I don't think
[16461.83s -> 16471.91s]  I can do this. I shouldn't be here. Gordorf had a splendid victory. Boatwreck and Epsilon. These are
[16472.47s -> 16482.39s]  rare scary monsters. I'm gonna die. Bug Batman versus kitty. Can I just leave? Can I just walk out?
[16505.40s -> 16513.72s]  That's not good. Maybe we should watch from the stands the rest of this.
[16513.72s -> 16521.93s]  Do I get money if he's showing up? What the fuck was that thing?
[16525.77s -> 16536.22s]  Um I want one of these. Where am I gonna get one of these? I've got this like stupid like
[16536.22s -> 16547.13s]  dementor that I I want one of these things. We will now hold the consolation match to take
[16547.13s -> 16560.42s]  the third place. What do I care? The final Boatwreck versus kitty. I mean kitty did 300 damage to me.
[16560.98s -> 16567.14s]  I don't I'm glad I didn't fight that guy. All right did I get any money?
[16567.70s -> 16575.70s]  I mean I was like an extra. Record loser? Oh I thought it meant I lost the fastest ever.
[16605.05s -> 16611.91s]  I need to make money. I'm gonna freeze him and I'm gonna go see if I can get toxic.
[16614.23s -> 16625.90s]  I don't think you can. I think I have to be like rank A to do it. All right let's try it. I'm gonna
[16625.90s -> 16643.10s]  try it. Put him on ice. The rare monsters I think you have to be A rank. I'll get Christmas Weezer.
[16646.20s -> 16661.90s]  Hold on a second. What does it take to combine? Combine 500 gold to combine. I'm gonna cheat here.
[16661.90s -> 16686.30s]  How do I save the game manually? I'm just cheating. I want to see what we get. I'm curious. 500 gold
[16686.78s -> 16707.45s]  and we're doing Bonnie and Bug Batman? Okay combine with you. What do I get?
[16707.45s -> 16720.09s]  Let's use an item as seasoning. Yes. Fisk chips. Seasoning. This can be used as a secret seasoning.
[16723.64s -> 16736.33s]  All right should we proceed? So there's a 31% chance we get a Kabalos. What's Terror Dog?
[16738.04s -> 16750.34s]  Blue. That's only five percent chance. Crimson-eyed blue sponge. Let's try noodle.
[16750.90s -> 16771.61s]  Yeah let's try a noodle. Bonnie and noodle? I'm curious. Or Bug Batman and noodle. We need the
[16771.61s -> 16791.98s]  blue sponge. PB and noodle. All right let's try that. Add some seasoning. Okay what do we get? 20%
[16791.98s -> 16824.49s]  chance for a Ripper. Allure. Basula. Ivory Wall. Ripper. Let's see these two. Gatton or Mint.
[16828.84s -> 16859.14s]  A Dayton? Mint? Dayton? Let's try it. Go for it. What do we get? Allure. Allure. Into the trash.
[16859.70s -> 16900.22s]  I don't want this. It's like it never happened. Um let's just see if we can get something else
[16900.22s -> 16915.32s]  interesting. I don't think I can get uh toxic. I think you have to be rank A. Yeah rare monsters
[16915.32s -> 16927.93s]  can only be- I gotta be rank B or A. Any other songs that you want me to try before I pull out?
[16928.81s -> 16943.11s]  Who should I play with? I think I'm gonna keep going with the um Spongebob? Spongebob Squarepants?
[16945.05s -> 16957.98s]  Super Spongebob Squarepants Battle for Bikini Bottom. Oh it's the actual game disc. Rehydrated?
[16957.98s -> 16978.41s]  Let's go. Come on. It's rare. Remember that. Spongebob Squarepants. Spongebob theme song
[16979.61s -> 16998.70s]  metal version. Stop being rare. That's annoying. What about Undertale? Undertale. Undertale soundtrack.
[17009.69s -> 17024.54s]  I gotta win a rank B match. That's the only way I can do it. There's nothing for the Simpsons
[17024.54s -> 17040.82s]  really? Limp Bizkit. Uh okay how about yeah chocolate starfish in the hot dog flavored water.
[17041.46s -> 17064.54s]  Give us something. Not this bullshit would have to be rank A. It's a piece of granite. Funny looking
[17064.54s -> 17088.12s]  monster. This thing is stupid. I mean I'll phrase it. What did I- I got one of these before. What
[17088.12s -> 17103.40s]  did I call it? It's just a wall again. Yeah. Oh Roblox. Well Sweetrind was not- Sweetrind was
[17103.40s -> 17134.52s]  like a watermelon wasn't it? Oh the Xbox Series X. Where's space? No no. Wait I can't do a space?
[17135.16s -> 17189.54s]  Freeze this motherfucker immediately. Train him. No he was sucked. I want to get one more. Team
[17189.54s -> 17225.74s]  Fortress. Sonic. Sonic Attack. Sonic Booms 1. Sonic by Soldier Boy. Alright. Rare. I hate when they're
[17225.74s -> 17240.70s]  rare. We're not good enough to open these. Crazy Frog. We already looked for Crazy Frog. Oasis.
[17240.70s -> 17277.19s]  Wonderwall. Everything is rare. Dragon Ball. I've seen too many names. Celine Dion? Really?
[17277.19s -> 17300.87s]  How is Celine Dion not here? Aerosmith. Aerosmith's greatest hits. Alright I'm just
[17300.87s -> 17325.37s]  gonna go win tournaments because like this is stupid. I want one more. Halo. Halo 4. Halo. Halo
[17325.37s -> 17344.23s]  4 original soundtrack. Finally we get to see a goddamn monster. Alright I'm interested. I'm
[17344.23s -> 17375.69s]  very interested. Dependable. That's a high defense. Those are good. It's kind of like crab. Crab
[17375.69s -> 17387.32s]  scorpion. Crab scorpion. Crab scorpion. Crab scorpion. Crab scorpion. Crab scorpion. Crab scorpion.
[17387.32s -> 17399.66s]  Master Chef. What are you doing? What are you doing? No stop it. Would you say what? Stop it.
[17405.06s -> 17426.98s]  Wellington. Actually I kind of like that. I like it. What is this? Is it a combination? Or is this
[17426.98s -> 17444.73s]  just a straight up crab thing? Let's take it. Why does he pick the worst one? Well how is it the
[17444.73s -> 17449.86s]  worst one? That's Wellington. I like it. Alright I need to know a lot about you. Who are you?
[17450.42s -> 17456.28s]  Alright you got pretty good skill already. Power is really good already.
[17459.34s -> 17467.59s]  You don't like cup jelly. You like battling. That's kind of unfortunate. Punch. Claw. Assault.
[17469.70s -> 17477.26s]  This is really good. Hit percentage. The force is bad on both these though. Bad scaling. But
[17477.26s -> 17498.73s]  at least you'll hit. Wellington is not a crab. And now you want me to freeze him after that?
[17498.73s -> 17507.48s]  After that shit? Are you serious? Alright what do we need? Power. I'm gonna say power. Intelligence
[17507.48s -> 17519.62s]  is real. It's definitely not intelligence. It's power and maybe speed. Power and defense. Alright
[17519.62s -> 17528.04s]  go for it. Let's see what you got. Right off the bat. That's alright. You're a baby. You just
[17528.04s -> 17543.93s]  figured it out. It's okay. It's okay. Don't worry. No you're fine. It's alright. Everything's fine.
[17543.93s -> 17558.09s]  I do want to buy more of those stress things. I need mint leaves. Somebody has to win a fight.
[17558.57s -> 17571.58s]  I'm gonna lose all my money. I need to take him through a tournament and just win. This is gonna
[17571.58s -> 17593.70s]  be bad. Okay no more. Stop spending. That was so cute. I love him. What'd you do to Weezer? I don't
[17593.70s -> 17606.39s]  know. Alright get some more power. Just enough to win a tournament. You got it right? Nice. Good job.
[17607.03s -> 17622.07s]  Level up. Perfect. Uh oh Jax you're running out of money. You better enter Wellington into a
[17622.07s -> 17638.09s]  tournament to make some bucks. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Right now. He's gonna do the voice
[17638.09s -> 17647.99s]  every time he says it isn't he? Whatcha doing? No stop. I just have to say a few things. Stop.
[17647.99s -> 17653.30s]  I love that. It's like my favorite thing about him. He's standing there like this. He goes like
[17653.30s -> 17678.12s]  this. He goes. Looks like it's raw. Not good in the middle. That's why. Absolutely. That's whatever.
[17678.84s -> 17702.60s]  I feel like I have pants on. I have pants on. Top half of your head was gone. Whatever. Who cares?
[17702.60s -> 17707.00s]  You're gaslighting us. Watch anything that Gordon Ramsay's ever done. He goes like up on his
[17707.00s -> 17713.50s]  on his heels. Like he goes on his toes. He puts his hands up like this. And he goes like up down
[17713.50s -> 17725.35s]  up up down. I'm serious. I love it. I think he has some amazing mannerisms. Alright let's kick some
[17726.07s -> 17734.36s]  He does the orangutan. Oh delicious. Absolutely delicious. Now in the pan. Did you put it in the
[17734.36s -> 17759.96s]  pan? I'm so sorry. Fucking idiot. Oh no. Oakley man is back. This is not good. New animated emote.
[17761.99s -> 17785.96s]  Actually might be okay. Damn that's good. We're about close. Not bad. That hits for a pretty
[17785.96s -> 17806.63s]  good amount. Job. Get back. I watch out the guts here. I can hit like two or three times and it's
[17806.63s -> 17815.83s]  over. Holy fucking shit dude. Give me a break. Wow. That was that was unbelievable. That just did so
[17815.83s -> 17848.76s]  much fucking damage. What a joke. What a joke. 80. He did almost 80 damage to me in one hit.
[17848.76s -> 17862.10s]  Wellington picked up the victory by default. Why? This is still winnable. I just have to beat Leon.
[17862.10s -> 17911.10s]  It should be a win. Back to back. Good. Back it up. No come on. I couldn't hit it. Alright go on.
[17911.10s -> 17925.82s]  How many coin flips am I gonna lose in a row? Kill this motherfucker. I'll just play it safe.
[17925.82s -> 17951.78s]  I don't want to get hit. Alright let's end it. Damn it. I don't think I can't beat Oakley man.
[17959.45s -> 17982.92s]  Okay. What keeps happening to Oakley man? He's always. I can do this. Started early. Alright
[17982.92s -> 17995.00s]  stop going for the big hit and just land the ones that have higher percentage. I'm not taking my own
[17995.00s -> 18007.94s]  advice. I don't know what I'm doing. 78 percent and he just gets confused. Thank you. He's got 99
[18007.94s -> 18019.32s]  guts. Why won't you swing? You make me look bad. I gotta do something. This is literally 10 seconds.
[18019.32s -> 18025.56s]  I fucking hit him. Swing at him. I'm just trapped in this stupid. He's zoning the fuck out of me
[18025.56s -> 18055.51s]  dude. Come on. That was stupid. I couldn't go left and I couldn't go right. Yeah yeah cool.
[18055.51s -> 18068.22s]  Excellent. At least I have enough to not go bankrupt again. Congrats to the guy that just
[18068.22s -> 18079.34s]  won 800,000 points. Are you serious? Jeez. Did you actually learn something? Alright that's good.
[18079.34s -> 18086.90s]  This is your first tournament. You almost won too. It's just like just to flip a goddamn coin if
[18086.90s -> 18096.50s]  you'll hit somebody or not. Isn't this guy's skill high? What's the problem here? You got 150 skill
[18096.50s -> 18102.46s]  at rank E. What's the problem? What's your problem? What's your problem? I don't understand. What's
[18102.46s -> 18128.57s]  your problem? You can rest. He doesn't like cup jelly right? It's not good because that's
[18128.57s -> 18135.50s]  something that lowers stress. I don't want any tablets. It's way too expensive. What did he like?
[18137.32s -> 18151.59s]  Milk? Fish? Maybe milk? Nutritious milk? Oh he likes battling. He doesn't have a preference.
[18151.59s -> 18159.88s]  Alright if you don't have a preference then I'm just gonna give you fish. Alright it's that time
[18159.96s -> 18167.61s]  of the day. It doesn't matter what it is. Whatever I see first in the chat is gonna be what I order
[18167.61s -> 18189.85s]  for food. We got new mail. It's gonna be Erentree isn't it? Alright if it's Erentree then I'm gonna
[18189.85s -> 18195.38s]  go freeze him and go use the other guy. It is. Alright. Alright. Fuck this. How much money do I
[18195.38s -> 18205.06s]  have? Alright there's a D rank battle right now. I'm gonna go freeze him. I'm gonna bring out.
[18205.70s -> 18210.74s]  I don't even remember their name. It was the snake. I'm gonna win this tournament and then I'm gonna
[18211.38s -> 18218.54s]  he has to learn. I gotta go freeze Wellington. Frozen Wellington. Disgusting. Really?
[18220.22s -> 18224.90s]  Frozen Wellington. You know I have to get rid of him because I'm not gonna stop doing that so
[18224.90s -> 18242.63s]  I would I probably should just freeze him. Frozen Wellington. No more fucking around. I gotta go
[18242.63s -> 18253.18s]  win the tournament and then do Erentree with that snake guy. Wake up bug Batman. Get out here.
[18253.18s -> 18263.96s]  What you doing? No stop. What you doing? Leave me alone. You're gonna fuck me up. I'm gonna have to
[18263.96s -> 18282.95s]  say it a hundred times. Shit he's so tired. It wins the next battle? Alright I have an idea.
[18287.18s -> 18298.36s]  Take this and then fight. You're definitely strong enough to do a D cup. Please win me this money.
[18298.36s -> 18303.35s]  Two thousand bucks and then we're gonna let you you can rest a few days then we're gonna send you
[18303.35s -> 18325.62s]  on a trip. Go for it. Only four contestants. It's not a big deal. Rank D. It's not gonna be hard.
[18329.62s -> 18333.30s]  Oh it's this motherfucker. This guy's gonna ruin everything.
[18334.18s -> 18349.19s]  Not sleep bomb. I have to come in second place. This is bad. I just did I was just a burn fight.
[18349.19s -> 18359.30s]  He's got so much more health but his skill and speed are awful. I just have to hope he
[18359.30s -> 18397.50s]  misses over and over again and just try to burn him down. Get up close. Miss. 70 fucking three
[18397.50s -> 18420.01s]  percent. Get out of town. Move. Bash his fucking skull and hurry up. Don't do another move. Dodge
[18420.01s -> 18433.66s]  it. Dodge it. Dodge it. Dodge it. Oh my god I killed him. I win. Okay that was very very stressful.
[18433.66s -> 18440.18s]  Don't lose my points. I want one of these. This thing is so cool. I actually want one of these
[18440.18s -> 18456.66s]  things. My webcam needs to be moved. It's too big. That's better. Alright two grand. That was
[18456.66s -> 18480.28s]  the hardest fight of the whole entire time. Come on now. Hella lost. Alright I'm fired. The thing
[18480.28s -> 18487.80s]  that's gonna kill me here is the high defense. Pretty evenly matched though. I got more health.
[18488.44s -> 18510.79s]  Give me a crit. Oh dodge is nice. Dodge again. I got him in guts. I got him I've beaten him in guts.
[18519.06s -> 18549.85s]  70 percent. Hit it. Combo. Fuck you. Yes. Oh that was so close. That would have been really bad if
[18549.85s -> 18563.88s]  I didn't win this. This is gonna save the whole run. I just need Winston to lose. Come on sleep bomb.
[18563.88s -> 18582.78s]  Get it. This guy every time. Is it just because he's faster? Alright well this is it. Stay in close.
[18582.78s -> 18590.57s]  Same thing. Don't be an idiot. I can take the hits. It's fine. I can hit him harder.
[18591.13s -> 18634.04s]  70 percent. Doesn't hurt. Two grand. Now I can definitely beat C. Get a new move. I'll get a
[18634.04s -> 18652.97s]  bonus. I'll get some of the fame back too which I lost it all. This game sucks and it's even worse
[18652.97s -> 18676.36s]  if you aren't good at it. How do you know this game sucks? You play it yet? He did the thing. He
[18676.36s -> 18709.11s]  did the thing. What? That's good. Uh praise. You don't like the game. You don't like the game.
[18709.11s -> 18716.20s]  You want to participate in a tournament and fight and you just did. That's gonna be really. I can't
[18716.20s -> 18737.16s]  do that. You just did one. Alright now we need some real rest. This game is one of the best games
[18737.16s -> 18747.08s]  ever to watch. Um it's whatever man. Like I knew when this was coming out I was gonna play it a lot.
[18747.88s -> 18752.04s]  So this is what we're doing and if people think it's fun that's awesome because I think it's fun.
[18754.63s -> 18761.18s]  I love this game and we're going to beat this game. Not like last time. Last time I did B rank
[18761.82s -> 18767.54s]  and I stopped playing it. We're going to beat. We're going to get to at least A to S rank. We're
[18767.54s -> 18774.57s]  going to. But no I mean I was fucking around earlier right? Like if you don't like the game
[18774.57s -> 18784.73s]  and you think this sucks then it's alright. I'm still good. See you next time. Alright so we should
[18784.73s -> 18807.93s]  go to uh alright our entry time. Please. Skill and life. This is gonna be it. We're gonna learn new
[18807.93s -> 18820.31s]  move. Finally. You know what? Go kill one of these guys too. Like Norty. Go fucking strangle Morty.
[18821.61s -> 18851.10s]  We can handle Morty. Come on. Good. Good start. Really good start. Plus like 15 or something.
[18851.10s -> 18871.06s]  Plus 20. That's alright. The shark part I just have to. I got a skill? What? I didn't even see
[18871.06s -> 18881.03s]  it. I didn't even see it. I got a skill. Did I? Oh damn this is awesome. Alright come on. Give me
[18881.03s -> 18907.69s]  over 200 skill. I want to fuse this guy with somebody. Take out the sharks. Yes! Come on.
[18907.69s -> 18921.00s]  Keep going. This is huge. This is the last one. Gigantic crab. Oh he got knocked down. Is that bad?
[18926.97s -> 18935.99s]  Oh that's it? Did I get it? I don't know what counts as a success here. What's going on?
[18938.54s -> 18945.06s]  What's happening? Did I lose? What are you doing? What the fuck is wrong with you?
[18945.78s -> 18952.01s]  I wonder how many failure points are here and I think I just did it.
[18953.82s -> 18966.38s]  Fall down. One last punch. Dude get him. Oh fuck. I don't this. That's alright.
[18969.27s -> 18976.41s]  There was probably 10 different failure points there. It seems pretty strong. Praise. Praise.
[18976.41s -> 18985.48s]  Let's go take a look. I'm really curious. Did you just become top tier? Alright come on. What do you
[18985.48s -> 19008.84s]  got? Whack and stab. Oh thank god. Finally. It took long enough. Now I can actually hit people
[19008.84s -> 19019.18s]  without a problem. Hit percent A. It does withering and sharpness. Yeah we'll keep these two on.
[19019.18s -> 19029.93s]  Thank goodness. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Let's go. Okay there's a C today but
[19029.93s -> 19039.98s]  I can't do it. We'll try the C one next week. So let's take. Let's go rest. Take some nut oil.
[19040.70s -> 19058.18s]  Maybe some stress reduction. Keep the horror. Sure. I'm not doing that ever again. I want to get to
[19058.18s -> 19087.29s]  200. Is it next week? It's not. Wait is it next week? That's not. Good work. 200 finally. I think
[19087.29s -> 19099.02s]  I'm good for skill for now. And we're gonna do tablets and see if I can get a little bit more
[19099.02s -> 19113.78s]  power. Yeah I'm gonna do the heavy training I think because I need to hit harder. Alright so
[19113.78s -> 19129.99s]  it's rest. Is he ready for C? I don't know. I need more speed. What kind of monster feeds his pet
[19129.99s -> 19141.18s]  gummy vitamins for an entire month? I just pulled my first monster and all the stats were under 10.
[19141.18s -> 19154.20s]  That sounds awful. Let me take a look again. I don't think it's enough. I think we have to skip
[19154.20s -> 19165.67s]  this tournament. 300 power. Get back to over 100 speed. I need health too. Yeah I'm gonna skip the
[19165.67s -> 19177.74s]  tournament. When's the next one after that? Alright we're gonna be ready for the official one. So
[19177.74s -> 19189.10s]  we're gonna do some training. I want to get. Let's go for the heavy one. Come on don't fail it. You
[19189.10s -> 19196.52s]  can't fight every single week man. You can't fight. I keep losing loyalty because he wants to fight
[19196.52s -> 19224.44s]  every week. It's like you have to rest man. Get up there. 300. Close. Close. Errantry again. Look at
[19224.44s -> 19240.31s]  this. It's from Auntie Verde. She's having a sale at her shop. Oh that's. Yeah I need that. I use
[19240.31s -> 19258.26s]  these items all the time. How much is it per percentage? Great discount. Not that much. Like
[19258.34s -> 19269.58s]  10% off. 20% off. Whatever. I mean I need them. Alright don't run out of money.
[19273.74s -> 19279.37s]  20%. What's up with that? How much can I get for.
[19283.67s -> 19299.75s]  I don't want the chips. Okay so we're going to train speed. I want to get this back over 100.
[19303.32s -> 19335.16s]  Does that count? Truancy? It's what he took off? Rest. Your boy is soft. Try it again.
[19335.40s -> 19357.32s]  Don't run away this time. Nice job. Alright back up to over 100. That's good. Very important.
[19357.32s -> 19377.22s]  I'm running out of money. So we're going to do fish. Why are you playing with this dingleberry?
[19380.15s -> 19384.82s]  Jelly. He doesn't like jelly. But no wait no he does. He's the other one that didn't like it.
[19385.78s -> 19391.58s]  It's going to be a 24 hour stream. I don't think that would work considering I'm
[19391.58s -> 19397.18s]  streaming the game awards tomorrow. Only two more of those tops.
[19397.82s -> 19409.40s]  Official tournament. Let's see if we can get it. How much time do I have?
[19409.96s -> 19424.55s]  Alright so it's train train rest C. What are we doing here? Should I go for some omega speed?
[19424.55s -> 19440.49s]  Dump it into power. Health probably. I'll do health. Nah I'll do health. It's a good idea.
[19441.13s -> 19473.62s]  Don't cheat. You're cheating. But I'm not going to scold you. Dude I want to participate in a
[19473.62s -> 19490.36s]  tournament. Yes you can. No it's not even next week. It's the week after. Get it up over there.
[19491.24s -> 19527.90s]  I'm going to feed him a mango. But will that make him happy? Yeah have a mango. Maybe that'll make
[19527.90s -> 19539.48s]  him more loyal. Not really. Okay rest up. I don't think I'm going to be able to beat this. Maybe
[19539.48s -> 19548.54s]  I'll try one of the lower ones then. C rank or should I try for C rank? I need money. Ungrateful
[19548.54s -> 19585.66s]  prick. I'm going to get my ass kicked. I'm going to get my ass kicked. Come on. I got over 300
[19585.66s -> 19600.12s]  power. 200 skill. Sussvane had. Wasn't that bad. Okay Huey. I got that new move too. Jesus.
[19606.98s -> 19615.98s]  What do you have for intelligence moves? Do not go anywhere near. Holy shit I can't believe
[19615.98s -> 19631.37s]  anything hit by Garfield's fucking laser hands. Stab him. Stab. Oh god damn it. Holy shit do it
[19631.37s -> 19651.11s]  again. Stay in. Don't let him push you. That move is sick. Fuck. Don't let him hit you. Don't let
[19651.11s -> 19676.90s]  him push you. No don't get hit by his laser cannons. It's alright. I can still come in second
[19676.90s -> 19694.50s]  or third place. Sussvane didn't even hurt this guy. I want. I want one of those. I want one of
[19694.50s -> 19714.73s]  those monkeys. Alright. Recknen. What do you have for stats? I'm just barely not good enough for
[19714.73s -> 19722.23s]  this. Defense is terrible though. Just got to stay in. It's going to just come down to who hits who
[19722.23s -> 19725.59s]  because we both have the same amount of skill he has. We both have power. He's got more health.
[19725.59s -> 19745.43s]  Just stay in there and stab him. Good dodge. Fuck off. Fuck you. Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails.
[19747.99s -> 19752.87s]  77. You won't swing the bat. Swing. I'm feeling like a fucking grandpa is yelling at a baseball
[19752.87s -> 19788.30s]  game. Swing. Hit him. Good. Get in there. Again. Stab. Fuck you. Hit him. Oh my fucking god.
[19788.30s -> 19800.28s]  Every time. It's just. Every time. Can I ever get this guy to have more than 47 percent? 50 percent?
[19801.00s -> 19805.98s]  I've been dumping and dumping and dumping and dumping and dumping stats into skill.
[19805.98s -> 19832.55s]  I got over 100 fucking extra points. I got to start winning games. Actually mad. Yeah I guess
[19832.55s -> 19841.99s]  I want to win. This is the guy that's beating everybody in with flawless victories. I'm not
[19841.99s -> 19855.70s]  even going to be able to get one. Well actually hold on. His defense is crazy. He's going to have
[19855.70s -> 19859.14s]  like a 30 percent chance to hit and he's just going to have to hit me one time and I'm dead.
[19859.14s -> 19893.58s]  Good luck. Can I dodge? My speed's awful. What is so confusing? No. Don't let him swing once. Back up.
[19895.64s -> 19910.97s]  Back up. Back up. All right go forward. Hit him. Back him up. Okay. I think I'm all right. Run in
[19910.97s -> 19938.09s]  and stab him. Oh my god. How do you miss this? It's impossible. I'm just holding left. Let's go.
[19938.17s -> 19953.85s]  We're good. I just can't lose. You literally fought a rock. Yeah and he was huge.
[19957.05s -> 19970.89s]  Sussvane is losing a lot. Yeah this Huey is going to win. He has like eight moves. He had this like
[19970.89s -> 19975.53s]  fire breath. He had a laser cannon. He had a dashing claws. I don't know. He was all over the place.
[19977.53s -> 19995.96s]  All right this is the monkey. I am very scared as I should be. I don't see how I win here.
[19995.96s -> 20011.21s]  But get lucky. Nice. All right. All right. All right. Hold off on the guts. All right. 60%. Keep
[20011.21s -> 20027.10s]  it going. Don't let him get near you. He is out of guts though. Four guts. Are you shitting me?
[20027.10s -> 20033.11s]  Just string it together. He can't do anything. Again. Again. Again. Again. Again. He can't do
[20033.11s -> 20051.00s]  anything. He has no. He has no mana. Dodge. What is so confusing? Oh what's he doing to my Wellington?
[20051.00s -> 20073.08s]  Come on. Got him. Why are you guys saying Trump? Did I sound like Trump?
[20076.60s -> 20112.28s]  I am actually still in this if I don't lose another one. Oh shit. He lost. Good. Okay. This
[20112.28s -> 20120.86s]  should be a pretty decent victory. This should be easy. He's the lost three times. Trump voice. I
[20120.86s -> 20145.72s]  need to hear this. I want to know what he's talking about. Why did I say that? What was that for?
[20148.02s -> 20157.58s]  Okay. Let's go. I think this guy's intelligence. I don't know how this person has lost three times.
[20157.58s -> 20162.39s]  Bad defense but everything else is really good. Even the power. All right. Well do not stay in
[20162.39s -> 20177.03s]  range of any green attacks so get the fuck in close now. All right. All right. All right. All
[20177.03s -> 20181.27s]  right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Just hit him one more time. Watch the guts.
[20182.07s -> 20186.31s]  Oh my god. What the fuck did he just do? You stupid game. This game's fucking rigged.
[20186.31s -> 20190.71s]  I can't believe it just died. Yeah. I literally just pressed one button and I died instantly.
[20202.09s -> 20208.04s]  How am I supposed to get away from that? I'm not an intelligence character so I just die?
[20208.84s -> 20226.66s]  I'm trying to stay in but he can like push it. Batman sucks. Yeah this is bullshit. I'm Batman
[20226.66s -> 20236.28s]  and go up against a bunch of fucking superheroes. Oh I got money and can aim good. Cool. These guys
[20236.28s -> 20257.61s]  have laser eyes. Your defense is too low? Yeah but it but okay. All right. Hear me out. Intelligence
[20257.61s -> 20264.78s]  moves. Defense means nothing. You only you take less damage from intelligence moves based on your
[20264.78s -> 20270.34s]  intelligence skill yourself. So if I'm not building an intelligence character then I'm gonna get
[20270.34s -> 20281.45s]  killed by the intelligence moves. You have no money and can't aim. So what are you? Um I don't know.
[20281.45s -> 20296.02s]  What? All right. This guy sucks except for his skill. He's just this is just a mirror match
[20296.02s -> 20313.14s]  except he's kind of better than I am. I would love to do a move. My guy doesn't know what what
[20313.14s -> 20343.72s]  fucking state he's in. I'm gonna get flawless now aren't I? My loyalty is not high enough so if I
[20343.72s -> 20366.90s]  try to tell him to do a move he blacks out. This guy's blacking out like 10 times a match because
[20366.90s -> 20372.98s]  we don't have a great relationship together or something. Why is he blacking out? Why is he so
[20372.98s -> 20388.42s]  confused? Into the freezer. No he's the best thing we got right now. I can't. I gotta at least beat
[20388.42s -> 20397.26s]  Zambor. Come on. It's time for some. All right how do I build loyalty? What's like the what what can
[20397.26s -> 20409.64s]  I buy him? What item can I give him to make him more loyal? Best you actually have is probably
[20409.64s -> 20440.38s]  Wellington. Probably actually. Don't come in last place I'll be happy. One more. Good. Oh shit.
[20441.26s -> 20472.22s]  Oh thank god. Uh I mean I I'm not gonna get any money but maybe I'll get fame.
[20474.87s -> 20490.01s]  Possible that I'll get fame? Hard to tell. How can you beat him without the last two?
[20490.01s -> 20494.63s]  Threw coins in the air and whatever one landed on heads three times that's the one I wouldn't.
[20495.19s -> 20501.75s]  He needs more loyalty that's why. The more loyalty he has the more. All right loyalty is like the
[20501.75s -> 20506.74s]  most important stat in my opinion at this point. Because if you tell him to do moves
[20507.46s -> 20514.07s]  and a third of the moves you tell him to do he doesn't do. I mean that's I'm just gonna that's
[20514.07s -> 20528.86s]  less damage. I'm not gonna get any money but will I at least get fame or something? I got 300 bucks
[20528.86s -> 20539.27s]  that's not okay I'm happy with that. Fame? What about auto fight? The problem with auto fight is
[20539.27s -> 20546.49s]  from what I've heard the CPU is notoriously notoriously unbelievably stupid apparently.
[20546.49s -> 20557.83s]  Like sometimes it just won't just will walk around it won't do anything. Very nice.
[20564.58s -> 20600.39s]  You tried. You tried your best. I need to win a tournament. Maybe this one or I gotta win money.
[20600.39s -> 20604.15s]  Well get him ready for this one. Should I just rest him up and just kind of fight the D?
[20604.15s -> 20614.01s]  I can't do crap. I'm not good enough for C. Maybe I should uh I need the I need $2,000.
[20614.57s -> 20629.56s]  It's so important. Rest him up. Get into that tournament and win. I actually will lose. I will
[20629.56s -> 20639.43s]  soft lock myself. All right let's go win this. You can't go lower than zero so don't worry.
[20639.43s -> 20663.10s]  I love this game. It's so much fun. I love just like needing to do better and try harder and train
[20663.10s -> 20670.70s]  better. You gotta make a golem or a jelly they're both pretty pog in my opinion. The naga is good
[20670.70s -> 20683.91s]  only once it's been trained to shitload. What don't okay so different types peak at different
[20683.91s -> 20693.58s]  places right? So from my understanding is some some of the base monsters like year one is where
[20693.58s -> 20697.82s]  you peak and you get the most amount of stat increases. Some of them are like year three near
[20697.82s -> 20703.82s]  old age you get the most amount of stat increases. Where what is this type? Is this later on in life
[20703.82s -> 20716.49s]  or third monsters have different growth spritz? Yeah so the base that I have here is peaking now
[20716.49s -> 20737.75s]  okay. Why are you doing the German explain thing? Dude you peaked in high school. I actually didn't
[20737.75s -> 20751.86s]  though. I peaked it I don't know like 10 to 5 years ago. I didn't peak in high school. I definitely
[20751.86s -> 20756.74s]  have passed my peak of I don't know I think maybe I'm coming down. I think I still got it though.
[20756.74s -> 20786.49s]  Did you see that tiktok orangutan dance? All right let's let's win. I need money. All right
[20786.49s -> 20807.16s]  bounce it back. Bounce it back. 40. I'm good. The thing is I'm not even ranking down to do this.
[20807.72s -> 20816.04s]  I haven't won a sea cup elimination tournament. So I mean like I got held back like six times in
[20816.04s -> 20837.48s]  the eighth grade. I'm still in the eighth grade right? Yeah I'm like 19 in the eighth grade.
[20838.04s -> 20860.71s]  Is that even possible? I don't think so. What happens? I don't think that happens. What happens
[20860.71s -> 20867.78s]  if you get held back like four times? Once you hit the soft cap for the first year you have to go
[20867.78s -> 20871.62s]  to the shrine and ask to reset there. I thought you're talking about what happens if you stay
[20871.62s -> 20876.57s]  back four times. You have to go to a shrine? I was trying to figure out what the fuck you're talking
[20876.57s -> 20891.67s]  about. Okay stay away from the intelligence moves I think. This stab is really good just to farm
[20891.67s -> 20900.22s]  these lower ranks though. These characters don't die. How long do the um what are the types that
[20900.22s -> 20923.16s]  I have? I think I have a wall right? The obsidian wall and it's a wall. It's a bug in Batman.
[20923.96s -> 20929.72s]  You have Wellington. I know but I have to make money. I have to make money and I have to get to
[20929.72s -> 20936.06s]  at least C or B rank so I can at least. This monster is peaking right now so I have to train
[20936.06s -> 20940.86s]  this monster. Try to win at least to like B or A rank so then I can actually get some cool monsters
[20940.86s -> 20958.25s]  and rare ones. I will let Wellington shine I promise. Maybe I'll combine them. Should I combine
[20958.25s -> 20994.54s]  Wellington and Bug Batman? Maybe I'll get maybe that'd be better. All right that's cute. Bye bye.
[20994.54s -> 21001.29s]  Uh Winston's passed away. You actually they actually can die. All right two thousand dollars
[21001.29s -> 21009.45s]  twenty two hundred maybe you'll get a little bit of fame. You have to get to at least C with this
[21009.45s -> 21013.37s]  monster. This game's like Dark Souls. You're supposed to just lose a bunch of times until
[21013.37s -> 21045.05s]  you get like the right combo. 2150. Go to Nagile whatever that is. Learned more? Yes.
[21048.68s -> 21060.57s]  You can't do a tournament back to back. No that. What's wrong with this guy? Why don't you ask me
[21060.57s -> 21077.66s]  that? Is it a re- what? Retire? You're not even two years old. What do you mean retired?
[21079.45s -> 21090.79s]  You're getting old? How long did they live? Are you shitting me? They die one year and eight months.
[21091.27s -> 21113.45s]  He's 68. You need to start training Bug Robin. Okay battle. When's the next- okay here it is.
[21113.45s -> 21117.05s]  He's gonna win this. He's gonna get to B rank. We're gonna freeze his ass and then we're gonna
[21117.05s -> 21123.40s]  combine him with Wellington and then we're gonna have a good base stats there. We'll take Wellington
[21123.40s -> 21129.51s]  all the way up to B rank. I gotta- I'm not gonna stop screaming am I? I'm like having two of a
[21129.51s -> 21147.69s]  time right now. I love this game. Uh I'll be all right. All right so this he's getting to the end
[21147.69s -> 21160.98s]  here. Well let's rest him up. See if we can take him to at least up to B rank which then combine
[21160.98s -> 21187.99s]  him with Wellington and see what we get. Go for it. All the way. Nice. Yeah we're really starting
[21187.99s -> 21202.38s]  to lose the uh prime there. It was like 18, 19, 18, 17, 18, 18. Now it's 9. All right but I don't
[21202.38s -> 21225.83s]  think I want to give anything too expensive. What's for dinner? I don't know. Train. Let's do- what
[21225.83s -> 21233.45s]  if I- I really need life maybe? At this point maybe I should just go all in on power. Just hope for
[21233.45s -> 21253.62s]  the best. What do you think? I gave him a cup of jelly for his last meal. He gets to eat- he'll eat
[21253.62s -> 21271.61s]  one more time. 300. Um I don't think I'll even be able to beat rank C. I think we freeze him now.
[21280.04s -> 21300.07s]  Past the prime here. 314. Seems well- not even tired. Get him- we'll get him in one more tournament.
[21300.07s -> 21329.93s]  What happens when they die? Um they die. Oh unless I freeze him. I can freeze him and combine him
[21329.93s -> 21340.10s]  which is what I'm gonna do that. That's kind of the point. I'm not gonna use any more stress
[21340.10s -> 21360.22s]  reducers on him either. Yeah there's a little funeral. There's a little like goodbye. All right.
[21360.22s -> 21377.19s]  Can we do it? Train twice. Rest. I'm just going straight power. Just power. There is no tournament
[21377.19s -> 21399.91s]  next week. Hope somebody freezes me when I get old and pass my prime. That was good. Seems well.
[21399.91s -> 21406.60s]  One more training session. This is the last time we will ever train this piece of absolute dog
[21406.60s -> 21439.03s]  shit. All right rest up. It's time to battle. I'm just kidding. I'm very fond of this uh this
[21439.03s -> 21449.94s]  little guy. Okay very well. Loyalty is pretty good. I don't- I think we're gonna get our ass kicked
[21449.94s -> 21470.38s]  but I'll try it. It's three moves and then into the freezer. Have increased my power by like 20
[21470.38s -> 21487.05s]  plus percent though. Some new faces here. All right. Xamber. Let's go. 330. High defense but
[21488.04s -> 21491.64s]  I do- I have a lot of power. Let's go for it. Let's see if I can just get in there and smash.
[21492.36s -> 21514.42s]  Don't want to get hit by that. Good start. Keep it up. Don't do anything yet. Go for it. Very good.
[21519.78s -> 21524.34s]  All right. Just hang back a little bit. Don't get killed. I need 14 guts to do this move.
[21525.14s -> 21541.83s]  Don't even you dare. Okay thank god. Win us a championship before retirement. Come on man.
[21541.83s -> 21556.95s]  You're gonna stream till like 12 a.m. Uh well we started really late because the game didn't come
[21556.95s -> 21566.14s]  out till 5 pacific. We will absolutely be playing this tomorrow. I have to beat the game. Tomorrow
[21566.14s -> 21572.70s]  is the game awards at 4 or 5 p.m pacific. I'll figure whatever it is. And then after the game
[21572.70s -> 21577.40s]  awards game awards are gonna be what like two three hours. We're gonna go right from the game awards
[21577.48s -> 21585.85s]  to this for like another three or four hours. We're 30? Yeah. Well we'll start around the same
[21585.85s -> 21597.46s]  time we did today. But I'm not done tonight. I still- I have- at least I want to get through.
[21597.46s -> 21612.15s]  I want to combine somebody and get a good round floor for the next monster. Yeah what is that
[21612.15s -> 21620.06s]  little thing? Offry? All right we got our ass kicked by Reckton last time. But it's a new day.
[21620.86s -> 21642.42s]  Just shred through that defense. It's a DPS race. I hope I can actually do moves. Dodge again.
[21643.06s -> 21649.10s]  Nice. All right. Okay okay okay okay. All right get in there. He's using all his guts.
[21649.98s -> 21678.50s]  Beautiful. All right this is good. One more. All right back it up. I- we're in pretty good shape.
[21678.50s -> 21700.95s]  We'll be at B rank. That little weirdo. Hey who said he was past his prime? Not yet. Another weak.
[21701.96s -> 21721.94s]  Maybe. All right this is the 2-0. Offry. I'm very curious of how strong you are. Okay you're very
[21721.94s -> 21729.66s]  very weak but you're impossible to hit. Stay in close. The intelligence moves are gonna kill me
[21729.66s -> 21748.97s]  in one hit. Get in close close close close close. Fuck! Stay in close. He can't even hurt you. Just
[21748.97s -> 21753.78s]  stay in close. Let the guts build up. He's gonna waste all of his toy hammer bullshit. Just don't
[21753.78s -> 21784.07s]  let him do an intelligence move. Okay get him. Yes! Take that motherfucker outside. Yes. Okay is
[21784.07s -> 21806.01s]  anybody else undefeated? Pivorous is currently undefeated. Pivorous. Not anymore. I'm gonna lose
[21806.01s -> 21821.46s]  to Sussmane. He's a mirror. Let's get in there. That's why you're so dangerous. You have a lot
[21821.46s -> 21831.51s]  of health. Not a lot of defense though. You're just a gigantic damage sponge. All right get in there.
[21831.51s -> 21849.02s]  Jesus Christ. Please. Watch that. I'm gonna build up guts. Don't just spam. This is how he wins fights.
[21849.02s -> 21857.27s]  He's just a like watermelon chewing gum. That's fine. Use it all. Go. I have to hit him like three times
[21860.95s -> 21872.33s]  and go. Oh get that. Get out of here. Now just don't die from. Now just let it just wait it out.
[21873.66s -> 21893.19s]  Stay in close and wait it out. Got it. Yeah you build up a bunch of speed. You build up a bunch of
[21893.19s -> 21898.86s]  health and then you become. You get hit two or three times. Doesn't matter. You can dodge the rest.
[21910.94s -> 21915.19s]  Is. Have I secured it? I think I have to win one more match and it's secured.
[21918.46s -> 21928.92s]  I know. Because if I have five wins it's impossible for anybody else to get to five wins right?
[21929.48s -> 21934.26s]  As long as he doesn't die on the floor then we should be fine.
[21937.66s -> 21946.94s]  If he dies in the arena then that's bad. I think can happen. All right here comes a real test. This
[21946.94s -> 21956.95s]  guy beat me bad last time. This is the monkey. It's gonna take a Christmas miracle to not lose
[21956.95s -> 21964.01s]  to this guy. I want to get hit by the intelligence moves so I have to stay back and then run forward
[21964.01s -> 21980.34s]  when I want to do something. All right back it up. I want to get hit by his INT move. What does
[21980.34s -> 21996.42s]  that do? They're booing him from eating a banana. Okay stay back. In. Back it up. That's fine. That's
[21996.42s -> 22011.54s]  fine. That's not a problem. Don't. There's so much. There's so much like tug of war going on here.
[22020.36s -> 22028.20s]  Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Holy shit. Thank god. That would have probably done 100 damage.
[22028.28s -> 22054.12s]  That was really really lucky. I win. Do I win? Okay. Reckonin? No. Pivorous needs to win the
[22054.12s -> 22066.14s]  rest of his games and Offry needs to win the rest of his games and it's a tie. Who's next?
[22066.14s -> 22071.18s]  Okay Reckonin needs to beat Pivorous right? Oh it's over. No. Okay. Reckonin needs to win right now.
[22071.90s -> 22083.10s]  There it is. Okay now Offry has to lose their next match. Zambor is lost every single time but
[22083.10s -> 22095.61s]  let's see. Well it's gonna be me versus Offry in the championship. Unless I win right now.
[22095.61s -> 22112.02s]  This is what it comes down to. This is to secure uh the C rank championship. I'm looking to try
[22112.02s -> 22115.94s]  to get hit by the INT moves if he has any on his bar which he doesn't so this is gonna be
[22115.94s -> 22149.74s]  just a fight. It's a mirror match. Good luck. Yes! That's it. C rank. C rank championship baby.
[22149.74s -> 22158.44s]  Hell yeah. It's the last thing this guy's ever gonna see unfortunately. Well no he's gonna
[22158.44s -> 22167.85s]  be combined. His DNA is gonna get combined with somebody else. I did not have any faith at all.
[22167.85s -> 22177.54s]  That was that was my mistake. I should have given him some um encouragement. Now we'll have access
[22177.54s -> 22192.65s]  to B rank which is great. If I go seven and oh though I'll get a ton of fame I think. All right
[22192.65s -> 22207.69s]  what is what monster is this? Nicole? It's like a cat. You're just hard to hit. That's all. Nothing
[22207.69s -> 22237.83s]  is too scary. Just have to hit you a few times. There's one. That's all I need. That secures it
[22237.83s -> 22253.45s]  I think. As long as I don't get hit by something horrible here. This just drains my mana. Still
[22253.45s -> 22269.94s]  win by percentage here. God you're a pain in the ass. Still win by percentage. Oh my god what I
[22269.94s -> 22281.66s]  don't I what's what's the percentage? Wow that was annoying. That was annoying. That's all right.
[22281.66s -> 22301.32s]  Sometimes a champion can't go undefeated. Let them play out the rest of the tournament. Whatever.
[22304.98s -> 22309.22s]  Why is the cat winning? Uh high speed and annoying moves that drain guts.
[22312.39s -> 22330.12s]  Nice work. Did he lose every single match? Zambor lost every match. I know what that's like. I can't
[22330.92s -> 22348.97s]  talk shit. Only 16 fame. I was almost undefeated in the tournament. Perfect. Perfect combination
[22348.97s -> 22362.84s]  here. Good job. You got us a B rank. You don't want to fight. You want to rest. It's time to rest.
[22362.84s -> 22374.87s]  What food are you gonna get? Uh I got five grand. Holy shit. I'm making money now.
[22379.90s -> 22395.70s]  Have a cup of jelly. You did good. Who is it? Oh I think this is it. Do I actually get to
[22396.26s -> 22413.61s]  become like an actual trainer? Rank three right? Oh yeah. Professional. I am now I can now open up
[22413.61s -> 22433.75s]  those other boxes. It's time for toxic. Very good job. Good work. So before we do anything let's
[22433.75s -> 22451.78s]  freeze you. I'll be using you later. Don't forget about spot. Yeah I gotta remember the exact ones.
[22451.78s -> 22464.30s]  All right the first one was spongebob square pants and it was the which one was it battle
[22464.30s -> 22490.17s]  rehydrated. All right this is this one. Generate. I'm not an authorized trainer. Very high level.
[22490.17s -> 22519.13s]  I need to have I need special rank. All right how about uh Christmas by Christmas by Paul Cardale.
[22519.69s -> 22553.38s]  What you got Paul? Cosmic stone. That's pretty good. 168 intelligence. Hold on to it for now.
[22588.30s -> 22631.91s]  Cosmic order. That's cosmic order. Cosmic calamity. Close enough. Cosmic calamity. All right freeze
[22631.91s -> 22643.02s]  this motherfucker. Wait hold on. Save the game. I'm gonna combine this and the and the other one.
[22643.02s -> 22649.62s]  These are really good base stats. If I combine this with the dragon this could be pretty big.
[22649.62s -> 22676.07s]  Save again. Okay let's do it. Yeah freeze. Cosmic Andy. Oh yeah Cosmic Andy. That's my favorite
[22676.07s -> 22698.81s]  character. I need something good. Bug Batman. Cosmic calamity. Doesn't know what the sub is.
[22701.08s -> 22721.03s]  What is that? That's a secret sub. See I saved it. That's a rare subtype. That's why it looks
[22721.03s -> 22740.07s]  cosmic. Crimson eyed. Oh that's already what Bug Batman already is a crimson eyed. No. All right
[22740.07s -> 22777.83s]  what about Wellington and cosmic calamity. Noodle and cosmic calamity. This can be used as secret
[22777.83s -> 22787.08s]  seasoning. Prospect here is unsure. Silhouette. I think I'm just gonna get cosmic calamity.
[22788.41s -> 22798.89s]  That's like a rare subtype. Why don't you just level that one up. I'm just gonna use the wall.
[22798.89s -> 22812.65s]  Why not? I might as well use it. Let's get really awesome base stats too. Yeah let's bring out
[22812.65s -> 22831.64s]  calamity. Let's go. 168 base intelligence. That's awesome. I'm sorry about the music. I can't help
[22831.64s -> 22858.94s]  it. All right let's go. What do you like? Likes meat and doesn't like tablets. Are you off putting?
[22858.94s -> 22867.02s]  Flattening and charge. No intelligence move. I need to we gotta get him out there. It's just way
[22867.02s -> 22906.70s]  too high. Study of the little bird. Scary. I almost fell out of the chair. I slipped. Try to
[22906.70s -> 22925.10s]  get him to 200 before we take him to a tournament. He's supposed to be smart. Let's do a little bit
[22925.10s -> 22941.13s]  of the mint leaf. Base sucks. Yeah it's scary. Definitely can't do F rank. Let's go. We'll do
[22941.13s -> 22982.68s]  this one. Should be all right. How do you cheat? Don't cheat. I mean don't cheat. Use that oil.
[22982.68s -> 23004.68s]  Academic dishonesty. Anyone know how long the walls live in general? You like meat. All right
[23004.68s -> 23028.25s]  we'll give you meat. Two weeks. 100 years. We'll do this one. Maybe we'll just wait till. I think I
[23028.25s -> 23040.76s]  could bring him now. He needs an intelligence move. I gotta look at his stats again. Once he gets to
[23040.76s -> 23044.68s]  200 intelligence I'm doing something else. Although honestly I really probably shouldn't even be doing
[23044.68s -> 23060.86s]  this because he doesn't even have an intelligence move. I should be doing something else. Health
[23060.86s -> 23094.66s]  probably. Health and skills. Whoa that speed though. Holy. Whoa that's bad. Seems well. When's that
[23094.66s -> 23103.53s]  battle? Nope. Yeah we'll just do the official one. I'm gonna keep doing this till he gets to 100.
[23104.17s -> 23134.92s]  He'll get hit by everything. I hate this wall. Take a hammer to it already. Health maybe? Yeah.
[23134.92s -> 23152.81s]  How does a wall run? He's cheating. Why are they? I have so many bad natured people. It's gold.
[23153.37s -> 23164.78s]  This looks like a PS2 loading screen. I know you don't want tablets but I'm gonna give them to you.
[23165.42s -> 23181.91s]  Tablets are always a good decision. The benefits well outweigh the fact that he doesn't like it.
[23181.91s -> 23204.50s]  Air entry? Yeah okay. I wonder. Should we just do it? I've got money. Should I just try? I know when
[23204.50s -> 23213.35s]  they're like a baby baby under under three or four months it's usually not worth it. I need an
[23213.35s -> 23223.21s]  intelligence move. Really bad. I have to get him an intelligence move. It's on sale right now.
[23223.21s -> 23246.26s]  It's just way too young. I'm gonna try to get the move. Will it not? It won't work.
[23247.98s -> 23265.59s]  Save and do it. All right so now it doesn't matter. I'll rest up though because I want him to be very
[23265.59s -> 23274.25s]  well rested. If I actually get an intelligence move this is gonna be huge. Sorry I swallowed the
[23274.25s -> 23287.66s]  back of my tongue. If I get an intelligence move it's gonna be huge. Okay. Int. There it is.
[23288.46s -> 23297.19s]  Go for it. There's a chance to acquire a new technique. You can fight that guy who cares. Go
[23297.19s -> 23329.61s]  for it. Monkey race. Beat him. Oh the block. Is that technically cheating? He's gonna be a big
[23329.61s -> 23337.62s]  deal now. I really hope that's an intelligence move because if it is then he's this is the new
[23337.62s -> 23357.00s]  this guy will bring us to be at least. We'll get B rank with this guy. Heard? Good job. Very good.
[23357.00s -> 23374.57s]  Very good. This is huge. Go all the way. Get another skill. It's all right. It's okay. It's
[23374.57s -> 23387.82s]  all right. You got to move. That's all that mattered. It's okay. Try again. Try it again.
[23387.82s -> 23408.34s]  There's another chance. Boom. Break out. Get out of the way. Dodge it. That's okay. All that matters
[23408.34s -> 23423.67s]  is the move. Good job. Nice work. Seems pretty tired. Give it some rest. What is the move?
[23434.98s -> 23476.20s]  Scratch. Why did you learn scratch? And it sucks. Okay. I can't do that. We're gonna have to do this
[23476.20s -> 23491.67s]  one. Round robin. Four entries. Thousand gold. Go for it. Speed again. Load the save. No I mean
[23491.67s -> 23526.94s]  he's got a new move. He gained a lot of stats too. Uh three weeks. Do some oil. What song was this
[23526.94s -> 23543.50s]  from? I think this is from Christmas by Paul. Something like that. Christmas by Paul. Did I
[23543.50s -> 23562.74s]  just rest? He's tired. Tired is he? Did I just rest? Or should I rest? I forgot. Build the loyalty up.
[23562.74s -> 23572.44s]  Yeah. Yeah I'm not gonna be left. I'm gonna stop the stream soon. We'll come back at it tomorrow.
[23576.12s -> 23590.54s]  Eleven thirty. Eleven. Okay. All right. Yeah we'll end. We'll end soon. Oh give him a cup of jelly.
[23591.34s -> 23600.42s]  Stress. I want to fight at least one time and then we'll end.
[23600.98s -> 23614.84s]  I lifted up. Your model is a rare class that's the highest ranked model type.
[23616.23s -> 23635.32s]  But your naga is a d-class and basically garbage breed. Really? Okay let's uh let's eat that
[23635.32s -> 23649.56s]  stress reducer. Train a little bit and maybe some intelligence. Thinking about maybe a little bit
[23649.56s -> 23657.00s]  of intelligence. Batman got farther than the dumb slab ever will. I don't I think he's gonna be
[23657.00s -> 23679.90s]  all right. All right battle is I don't know I don't have I gotta just do E.
[23681.02s -> 23689.61s]  I definitely do not have what it takes. Rest. Gonna go to bed? I will soon. Very soon. We'll
[23689.61s -> 23704.12s]  see it. We'll I'll be around tomorrow. Game words. It's bottom it's like bottom five monsters in the
[23704.12s -> 23722.95s]  game. Are you serious? That sucks. All right after this we'll I'll be done. This train a little bit
[23722.95s -> 23740.52s]  more and then we'll go from here. Maybe one more tournament. Maybe. I got a defense. I got high
[23740.52s -> 23758.73s]  defense. Let's try that new move. Scratch. I mean it's kind of funny looking. 85% you won't even
[23758.73s -> 23796.76s]  do anything. Come on man. Oh that hurts guts too. That move is fucking stupid. Good. Good. Be close.
[23797.56s -> 23826.44s]  Dodge it. I think that's a win. No more bets. Yeah no more betting. I want to get to a point
[23826.44s -> 23841.50s]  where I have 800 power and shit. You know what I mean? I've only peed once today. Or she drinks
[23841.50s -> 23854.90s]  some water. I drank water right here. Uh just go for the one that hits. Which is flattening.
[23855.78s -> 23879.62s]  Unless this little shit beat me please. Oh my god am I gonna lose for the first time ever?
[23881.10s -> 23907.29s]  The rabbit. It can't happen. He's gonna KO me. Do something. What the fuck? The rabbit is the
[23907.29s -> 23926.02s]  shittiest enemy in the whole game and I actually lost. All right I have to beat you. How did you
[23926.02s -> 23962.26s]  not get an intelligence move? I don't understand. Get it get it get it get it get it get it get it
[23962.82s -> 24014.70s]  combo combo combo combo. Back this shit up. No. 62% swing at him. 85. He just his loyalty is too
[24014.70s -> 24025.08s]  low. Tried to bring him in too early. Damn it. I thought I had that too. At least I get the money
[24025.08s -> 24044.31s]  back. It's fine. That's okay. Uh I'm not praising you at all. I'm sorry but you don't get praised.
[24048.38s -> 24055.27s]  Style even. I don't want to. The last character was so spoiled he wouldn't listen to half the
[24055.27s -> 24076.01s]  things I said. Send his ass on an errand tree. It's too expensive right now but I want to.
[24076.01s -> 24098.52s]  Official tournament. He's not ready. Actually just not ready. I need at least 30 to 40 loyalty. Not
[24098.52s -> 24114.49s]  worth it. I want to send him on an errand tree so bad. Not going to though. Don't do it. Just train
[24114.49s -> 24135.69s]  normally. I'll eventually get an intelligence move. I will. That was pretty good. How much garlic do
[24135.69s -> 24153.27s]  you have to eat to become handsome? A couple cloves a month. Eat the banana. I think the banana is
[24153.27s -> 24178.17s]  killing me. That's another good one. Probably seven or eight. Damn. Why buff intelligence with
[24178.17s -> 24186.55s]  no moves? Well because there's a certain finite amount of time in a monster's life that they will
[24186.55s -> 24191.59s]  gain stats. They'll gain way more stats than they would when they were a baby or when they're older.
[24192.54s -> 24199.74s]  So I'm just trying to dump intelligence into this motherfucker. So eventually when I get if I just
[24199.74s -> 24206.81s]  hammer intelligence I'll be able to get him an intelligence move and he'll have like 400 intelligence
[24206.81s -> 24223.70s]  and I'll laser beam people in one second and he'll be gone. Gone. Disintegrated. Intelligence again.
[24227.45s -> 24241.42s]  After this one I will. I'm gonna do one more tournament. No I'm not. Errand tree. He is.
[24242.46s -> 24249.16s]  Fuck the errand tree. Forget the errand tree. He's got so much health. So much. Not health.
[24249.16s -> 24262.47s]  Whatever. He's getting a lot of intelligence from this. Do it again. Just do it again. He's
[24262.47s -> 24295.16s]  killing it. Little ding. There it is. All right. I need an intelligence move. Okay. Probably.
[24295.16s -> 24309.98s]  Should I send him on an errand tree and just say screw it? And well I really want to unfreeze
[24309.98s -> 24322.26s]  Batman and do a tournament. Rest up. You're going on an errand tree tomorrow. If I lose all my money
[24322.26s -> 24327.78s]  whatever I'll just bring Batman out of retirement and just have him win a C rank or something or a
[24327.78s -> 24336.89s]  B rank or a D rank. Why are you even increasing intelligence? How smart do you have to be to just
[24336.89s -> 24343.91s]  crush someone? But look at him. He's made out of galaxies and planets and stars and stuff.
[24343.91s -> 24348.89s]  He's eventually gonna be able to learn a move that is gonna be like a galaxy bomb or something.
[24348.89s -> 24357.50s]  I don't know. He's like he's intelligence based right? All right let's save it.
[24357.50s -> 24373.27s]  Errand tree intelligence. Let's go. 2,000 bucks. Don't care. Intelligence. There is some chance to
[24373.27s -> 24399.45s]  acquire a new technique. Go after this guy. Come on. I'm looking for 10 intelligence each time.
[24408.44s -> 24416.97s]  Beautiful. Bruising past 200 plus intelligence at this young of an age. He's a little genius.
[24421.38s -> 24436.47s]  We got a raid? Oh shit there's a raid. Who raided? Oh shit. Atriarch. What's going on? Thanks for the
[24436.47s -> 24445.98s]  raid. We did it. That's a big raid. That's a lot of people. What's going on? Thanks for the raid man.
[24446.62s -> 24454.30s]  Playing Monster Rancher 2. The new meta of Twitch. Guaranteed. Don't let me be the one to tell you.
[24454.94s -> 24461.21s]  All right we didn't do this one last time. Stop doing that. I'm not doing a tuber voice. I'm just
[24461.21s -> 24465.82s]  being in person. He couldn't make it last time. He's gonna get up there this time. I guarantee it.
[24466.62s -> 24483.19s]  Do it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. Oh that's slick. Any new technique?
[24485.93s -> 24494.74s]  No new technique. Got one more chance. Big gorilla. He's gonna knock it out of the park
[24494.74s -> 24497.94s]  and he's gonna get an intelligence technique and everyone, all the haters, all the doubters,
[24497.94s -> 24514.92s]  are gonna be shut up right now. Welcome everybody. Did I hit him in the bum? I'm hot. This is to prove
[24514.92s -> 24523.74s]  how intelligent I am by fucking with a wild gorilla. Is this intelligent or is this really stupid?
[24524.38s -> 24537.40s]  Stop pretending to be normal. I'm fine. I'm not normal. He got it. I think he actually did it.
[24541.11s -> 24559.05s]  New technique. Oh shit. I have to fight this. Low defense. High health. I was gonna crush this guy.
[24559.05s -> 24578.73s]  Just scratch him and crush him. I don't even play. It's the computer. Fight him. Come on. Get in there
[24578.73s -> 24588.46s]  and smash. Smoosh him. The computer is so stupid. Stop just touching. Stop walking into him and crush
[24588.46s -> 24593.94s]  him flat like this. Like a pancake. There's no timer either. It's just something you have to die.
[24598.84s -> 24628.65s]  Do some other move please. He just has to hit it. Good. Not good. One damage. Attack him.
[24629.21s -> 24635.99s]  He probably has 80 plus guts right now. There it is. That's what we wanted to see. Do it again.
[24636.63s -> 24657.54s]  I don't think it's gonna happen. Come on. The scratch is the best move I have right now and
[24657.54s -> 24674.82s]  he needs to start using it or just bow. What was the bow for? Do something. Oh you did a move
[24674.82s -> 24707.34s]  finally. Great. Very good. It's close. Do it. Get him. Get him. Good. I have to hit him three
[24707.34s -> 24715.72s]  more times. Again. Do it again. This idiot has two other moves. He's not doing any of them.
[24727.70s -> 24732.18s]  He might actually win by doing this over and over again. He's clutching it out right now.
[24733.06s -> 24739.45s]  This could be huge. Alright. Yeah. Shoulder tackle. Shoulder tackle again. You got it in you?
[24739.45s -> 24745.53s]  He just fucking won. You just beat him. You actually just beat him. Actually just won.
[24745.53s -> 24763.99s]  Give me a new technique. I did the whole thing. Great Cosmic Calamity. It's an easy battle to win
[24763.99s -> 24779.64s]  against those guys. Let's go back. I didn't get prize money. Oh it was 50% off because we won.
[24779.64s -> 24787.37s]  Beated a wild monster. It's wonderful. It could not acquire any techniques but its
[24787.37s -> 24800.31s]  parent tree was very successful. It was. I think you can catch them. Pretty tired. Alright.
[24800.31s -> 24813.80s]  Look at this data here. This guy is going to be at 300 intelligence before the first
[24813.80s -> 24823.93s]  goddamn tournament. Go to YouTube and type worst monster rancher 2 monster. It's literally this
[24823.93s -> 24859.02s]  one. What? Is it actually the worst one? Do I just have this so wrong? But he looks cool.
[24873.22s -> 24902.15s]  Let me turn this down. I can't hear this. Raising the worst monster in the game. Are you fucking
[24902.15s -> 24909.69s]  kidding me? I know if it's too loud, too quiet, anything like that. It looks very well. What?
[24911.61s -> 24935.61s]  It's a good one. I must have done it. It's not what it can't be. What? It wasn't paying
[24935.61s -> 24952.46s]  attention at all. What does it say at the end? Plus three again. Plus three again. 500? That's
[24952.46s -> 24965.93s]  500. Plus three again. I want to hear him say. Plus one. What's wrong? We died. He's dead? What
[24965.93s -> 24977.45s]  do you mean he's dead? Cole, I'm sorry about Proxima. Is it actually the worst monster in
[24977.45s -> 24988.70s]  the whole game? This is the worst combination in the game. I'm way too invested. Read the
[24988.70s -> 24997.82s]  description of that video. Bugs and bad stat growth make Monal just terrible to try and raise.
[24997.82s -> 25005.11s]  Worse than Metalners since at least Metalner live a hundred weeks longer. We try to raise
[25005.11s -> 25016.04s]  Proxima the best we can and beat the major four. But what if they fix the bugs maybe in this release?
[25018.54s -> 25030.42s]  His first intelligence learned move he gets when intelligence and speed are over 400. Are you telling
[25030.42s -> 25048.52s]  me I gotta ice this guy because I can't even do this? Are you kidding me? Over 400 intelligence?
[25048.52s -> 25058.26s]  What if I get to 400? I'm gonna get him to 400. All right, so I get him to 400, which we're not
[25058.26s -> 25072.23s]  even that far away. He needs 400 speed. Oh, that is not gonna happen. Wait, it's 400 combined
[25072.23s -> 25083.53s]  intelligence and speed. So not 400 each. People are saying something about the Papa's Errantry?
[25083.53s -> 25090.02s]  You need to do the Papa's Errantry to unlock strange light, which is an int move in the slot
[25090.02s -> 25107.64s]  before scratch. Okay, so I think I'm there. All right, so I gotta get to 330 intelligence.
[25107.64s -> 25119.96s]  Easiest thing I've ever done in my life. Let's go. I gotta leave. I'm so sorry I just like screamed
[25119.96s -> 25129.90s]  in your ear. I did not think it was gonna be that loud. Yeah, it's time to go. It's time to go.
[25129.90s -> 25136.26s]  I'll be live tomorrow. We'll pick right up tomorrow. Don't worry. Read the comments on that video.
[25136.26s -> 25148.26s]  If you see this, it'd be so great to see playthroughs with all the unique monsters.
[25148.26s -> 25161.42s]  This is nostalgic. Oh, you guys. Well, you know what? I'll tell you. This guy, Jack of Hearts,
[25161.42s -> 25167.50s]  got Monster Rancher 2 channel pretty much like doing Monster Rancher 2 shit. It should fucking
[25167.50s -> 25187.13s]  stop for this person. Give us a delayed raid song. I'm gonna just put the camera off. Thank you
[25187.13s -> 25206.23s]  for the rain. I see Monster Rancher 2 tomorrow as well as the game awards. I don't know what
[25206.23s -> 25213.45s]  I'll do first. Probably game awards first. So I can just go right from that directly into this.
[25213.45s -> 25221.42s]  Game awards. Let me actually look that up and get a correct time for you here. Thanks for sticking
[25221.42s -> 25227.90s]  around this long. I'm surprised that this many people still here. It's very, very late, but I'm
[25227.90s -> 25233.53s]  gonna play this game a lot. At least get to the end. I can't promise there'll be a face cam on
[25233.53s -> 25241.59s]  every time, but you know, whatever. This game's incredible. It's a lot of fun. It's just a good
[25241.59s -> 25248.38s]  time, so we're going to keep having it. Yeah, that's it. We'll end it there. Game awards are
[25248.38s -> 25266.47s]  what time? They are 4.30? Yeah, 4.30. I'll be live at like 4.15 just to kind of chill and wait for
[25266.47s -> 25276.44s]  the broadcast to go live. So I'll be live at 4.15 Pacific time in the afternoon tomorrow.
[25276.44s -> 25281.53s]  Take care of yourselves. Thanks for watching, everybody. I'm gonna make sure I save the game.
[25281.53s -> 25291.82s]  That's so unfortunate. This is the worst thing in the whole game. I gotta get to S rank at least,
[25291.82s -> 25307.98s]  right? It's about the personality of the monster, not the stats. You make the story.
[25311.56s -> 25319.61s]  That's true. That is true. You do have a point. There was a lot of community subs today, too.
[25319.61s -> 25331.18s]  I'm gonna give a hundred, which is insane. It was a 75 community sub as well. That was Sovine and
[25331.18s -> 25340.66s]  then Arawani. Thanks, both of you. The monsters. Very, very cool. Atrioc, thanks for the raid,
[25340.66s -> 25344.98s]  too. You guys are still here from Atrioc. Thanks for watching. Thanks for sticking around. Maybe
[25344.98s -> 25359.88s]  we'll see you again, and we will see you tomorrow. He's spinning around in a circle.
[25364.46s -> 25368.70s]  It's very late. Nobody's really live right now, but I will send you guys... I'm gonna send you
[25368.70s -> 25384.02s]  guys to Miskiv. What are you doing, Miskiv? Art contest? I'm following... Yeah, Miskiv is live
[25384.02s -> 25394.17s]  right now. Go say hello. No, you can say that I missed him in Smite because I play that game
[25394.17s -> 25404.73s]  all the time and he didn't even ask to play with me, by the way. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Take
[25404.73s -> 25421.19s]  care. Have a great night. Drama. Peep the horror. No more horror peeping. I'll see you guys later.
[25421.19s -> 25426.55s]  Have a great night. Why is this... Five seconds. What do you mean five seconds? What are you talking
[25426.55s -> 25433.29s]  about? I just said raid. What? Okay. For a second, I thought it was raiding in five seconds. I didn't
[25433.29s -> 25443.69s]  have time. Everyone relax. We're fine. See you tomorrow for the game awards. Good night. Goodbye.
[25443.69s -> 25451.74s]  Take care of yourselves. Go say hello to Miskiv. You better get me at least 7,000 viewers. Otherwise,
[25451.74s -> 25461.94s]  come on. There's gotta be 7,000 people going over there. I'm not... You have to. I just told you.
[25462.58s -> 25468.23s]  Come on. Do a reverse raid song. Okay.
[25476.55s -> 25492.97s]  Did you tell what I said? I am excited for the game awards tomorrow even though I played literally
[25494.01s -> 25502.66s]  probably one game that came out in 2021. I'm gonna have no idea what to even say.
[25505.08s -> 25532.06s]  All right. Goodbye. Good night.
