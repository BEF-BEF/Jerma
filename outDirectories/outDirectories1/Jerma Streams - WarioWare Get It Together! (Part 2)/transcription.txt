[1.02s -> 4.14s]  Alrighty, alright. Let's change in the title and we can go.
[5.93s -> 7.61s]  Let's see if I can get to round 50.
[21.78s -> 26.20s]  How's my cam? Is the cam still fucked up?
[26.20s -> 32.25s]  I'm not just gonna go right into it. I'm not just gonna jump into it. I need practice.
[33.13s -> 34.01s]  This camera.
[41.05s -> 41.53s]  Practice.
[42.17s -> 45.13s]  I'm gonna go just- I'm gonna just go here and I'm gonna go.
[46.33s -> 49.27s]  I lost all my points believing in you.
[52.15s -> 55.83s]  You can't just go right into super hard. I need this- I need like a 10 to 20 minute
[56.87s -> 58.15s]  get my brain going again.
[62.73s -> 64.25s]  I forget what half these guys even do.
[64.25s -> 69.37s]  Alright, let's do it.
[74.86s -> 75.34s]  Three o'clock.
[80.44s -> 83.40s]  I just read a shitty comment in a sea of handsome streamers.
[96.39s -> 97.75s]  Not this fucking thing again.
[100.57s -> 105.05s]  Did I do it? Alright, I was gonna say what the hell.
[109.58s -> 112.47s]  Knock that up, right?
[113.51s -> 113.99s]  Fuck it up!
[114.63s -> 118.12s]  Change the weird baby sound effect.
[121.64s -> 124.20s]  I can't change- It's the sounds of the game, man.
[139.98s -> 145.75s]  Alright, I'm feeling- I'm getting warmed up. I'm feeling the juices flow.
[146.47s -> 155.78s]  The baby color.
[156.58s -> 159.27s]  Oh, you're talking about that like frog noise.
[159.27s -> 159.59s]  That's actually-
[162.07s -> 167.99s]  That's it, right?
[170.23s -> 171.19s]  I don't understand that one.
[172.87s -> 174.63s]  How- Do you have to just keep doing it?
[180.90s -> 182.42s]  It has to be consistent speed.
[197.69s -> 201.77s]  Base cam is delayed.
[201.85s -> 205.05s]  Yeah, I- I could try to fix it in a minute. Hold on.
[205.05s -> 209.05s]  Alright, canister, juice, hat, backpack.
[209.05s -> 210.97s]  Canister, juice, hat, backpack.
[216.54s -> 217.74s]  Something in my throat.
[217.74s -> 222.54s]  I need a canister.
[229.56s -> 230.20s]  Shit, alright.
[230.76s -> 241.34s]  I need a hat and a back- hat and mug.
[241.34s -> 243.50s]  I definitely can fix it by doing something here.
[243.50s -> 246.17s]  Oh, shit. No, no, no. Put this back.
[247.05s -> 251.93s]  Okay, it's a canister.
[252.57s -> 254.57s]  The cockroach just keeps freaking me out.
[259.80s -> 261.88s]  Get that fucking cockroach out of here. It's annoying.
[269.72s -> 271.64s]  Baby noise is giving us suffering.
[271.64s -> 273.48s]  You're gonna be fine.
[273.48s -> 290.78s]  Oh, that's a lot.
[291.50s -> 292.06s]  150.
[292.78s -> 296.30s]  Hold on a sec.
[296.30s -> 305.22s]  I had- I had way more time than I thought I did.
[305.22s -> 309.62s]  What time is it?
[311.96s -> 313.08s]  Move over!
[313.88s -> 314.68s]  I thought I had like-
[315.56s -> 325.30s]  I thought I had more- I thought I didn't have enough time to do that.
[325.30s -> 326.90s]  I couldn't move the damn thing.
[326.90s -> 333.51s]  Alright, I'm good.
[334.55s -> 343.18s]  Got it.
[345.98s -> 352.68s]  That- What is-
[352.68s -> 355.08s]  That's one of the dwarves from the Hobbit movie.
[355.64s -> 359.46s]  Get it.
[363.26s -> 364.14s]  Baby noise is funny.
[365.58s -> 366.46s]  I'm not even hearing it.
[369.02s -> 375.13s]  My lip gloss is-
[376.81s -> 380.07s]  Ooh, that was close.
[383.98s -> 389.37s]  My game's not muted.
[389.37s -> 389.85s]  I know, it's like-
[391.37s -> 397.80s]  Okay. I don't like that one. That one sucks.
[402.86s -> 406.38s]  I might get to 50 on this one.
[416.63s -> 422.18s]  You just gotta get one of those.
[422.98s -> 423.70s]  Nice bitrate.
[424.42s -> 427.13s]  I am streaming.
[427.85s -> 434.20s]  I'm streaming at the maximum bitrate that Twitch allows.
[435.08s -> 441.48s]  Okay.
[441.48s -> 442.04s]  Mug, mug.
[453.58s -> 454.62s]  864p.
[455.34s -> 459.50s]  864p is the resolution, not the bitrate.
[460.06s -> 463.10s]  Oh, I thought we had some smart people here.
[463.98s -> 470.63s]  Alright, what do we got?
[470.63s -> 482.30s]  Red.
[482.30s -> 482.80s]  Oh!
[482.80s -> 485.52s]  Man, man.
[485.52s -> 487.12s]  Why don't we have 4K stream?
[487.12s -> 489.92s]  Because if I streamed in 4K with a 6000 bitrate,
[489.92s -> 491.76s]  it would look like I threw up all over your screen.
[492.48s -> 501.69s]  Guys, 1080p at 60fps with 6000 bitrate does not look good.
[502.89s -> 504.51s]  I would need-
[505.47s -> 505.63s]  This-
[506.67s -> 508.43s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[511.77s -> 513.05s]  Okay, it was blue, blue.
[513.61s -> 514.33s]  Okay, blue, blue.
[515.61s -> 520.91s]  1080p 30, you can-
[520.91s -> 521.23s]  It might-
[521.23s -> 522.11s]  You could do okay with.
[523.15s -> 523.47s]  I don't know.
[523.47s -> 528.75s]  I think a 1080p video at 60fps, you need like a 10,000 bitrate for that to look okay.
[530.27s -> 548.41s]  Don't you have 3090?
[548.41s -> 549.45s]  That does not really-
[549.45s -> 552.65s]  It's just about what Twitch has for their limitations.
[555.68s -> 560.32s]  I could stream Nvenc with my 3090, and I can't get out.
[560.32s -> 560.88s]  I can't leave.
[563.04s -> 565.12s]  It's still the limitation of 6000 bitrate.
[565.12s -> 570.49s]  I could run at slowest as possible in coding, but that doesn't really do anything.
[573.05s -> 576.65s]  The actual CPU preset and the Nvenc presets here-
[578.09s -> 581.85s]  Once you go past medium, there's really not a real discernible difference at all.
[582.89s -> 584.22s]  What fucking time is it?
[585.42s -> 593.44s]  You can go beyond 6K, you have to enable it in OBS.
[594.24s -> 597.80s]  I mean, I could physically do it, but it's against Twitch's guidelines.
[598.76s -> 602.52s]  If I strike a stream right now with like 20K bitrate,
[602.52s -> 605.00s]  and I would get Twitch to turn my channel off, I'd get in trouble.
[605.56s -> 607.07s]  What?
[618.24s -> 620.00s]  Can you stream with a 60fps camera?
[623.61s -> 624.33s]  Well, here's the thing.
[624.33s -> 632.04s]  I don't- The reason why my camera's not 60fps right now is because my fucking camera is-
[632.04s -> 632.54s]  Whatever.
[634.92s -> 636.12s]  You fucked me all up.
[636.12s -> 636.68s]  Whatever.
[636.68s -> 639.00s]  Listen, I can do it, but it's-
[639.00s -> 639.96s]  Look, watch what happens.
[643.96s -> 649.34s]  39, whatever, I don't care.
[649.34s -> 653.05s]  So I have to have my exposure up really high
[653.05s -> 655.29s]  because I don't use webcams that frequently.
[655.29s -> 655.85s]  I don't really care.
[656.83s -> 659.39s]  So my exposure has to go up, but when you let more light in,
[660.11s -> 664.35s]  when you pull more light into these webcams, you're opening up the iris.
[664.35s -> 666.59s]  So the frame rate just gets annihilated.
[666.59s -> 667.23s]  Ready? Watch this.
[667.87s -> 676.86s]  So I just turn it all off, and I have to restart the camera.
[676.86s -> 681.05s]  This is not going to go through here.
[681.05s -> 681.93s]  Here we go.
[681.93s -> 684.17s]  Watch this, ready?
[689.28s -> 690.32s]  Now the camera has to restart.
[696.72s -> 697.68s]  I have to restart the camera.
[699.04s -> 699.84s]  Well, you can blame-
[700.40s -> 703.04s]  So here's the thing, I've talked shit about this in the past.
[704.33s -> 706.41s]  I don't- I really don't know why every webcam-
[706.41s -> 709.66s]  Even like the UI for the webcams, like controls and stuff,
[709.66s -> 711.34s]  are stuck in like 2003.
[718.51s -> 724.19s]  Are we going to get like technology that's not based in like 2004, 2005, or webcam?
[728.16s -> 730.80s]  Why did they just stop developing better quality webcams?
[731.36s -> 732.16s]  Did they just think-
[732.16s -> 735.92s]  Did they realize that nobody really cares after 1080 or after like 720?
[735.92s -> 739.12s]  And that like an overexposed, like kind of sloppy, shitty exposure is-
[739.12s -> 739.68s]  I don't understand.
[739.68s -> 743.69s]  Why is it- Why are we stuck in 2006?
[743.69s -> 745.13s]  Use a DSLR?
[745.13s -> 748.57s]  I don't want to set up a gigantic DSLR,
[748.57s -> 750.97s]  and have a convoluted system to plug it into my-
[750.97s -> 754.94s]  So I could do a high quality camera on my stream.
[754.94s -> 761.52s]  I just want technology from like 2016.
[761.52s -> 762.32s]  Use your phone?
[766.64s -> 769.28s]  Look, I'm back in 60 FPS, or at least close to it.
[769.28s -> 775.02s]  Company has software for the camera.
[775.02s -> 776.70s]  Low quality camera adds to your charm.
[778.27s -> 778.99s]  No, I-
[778.99s -> 781.02s]  Look, I'm not going to set-
[781.02s -> 782.54s]  I'm not going to set up a setup like that.
[784.96s -> 790.08s]  What, for like the four times a year I turn my webcam on for more than 20 minutes?
[790.08s -> 794.84s]  No, I don't want to do this again.
[801.77s -> 802.92s]  I'm warmed up.
[802.92s -> 811.08s]  Don't you have the money for it?
[811.08s -> 814.52s]  Just because something is possible does not mean it should be done.
[816.67s -> 819.87s]  What, because I can like set up a DSLR over here,
[819.87s -> 820.91s]  and have like this elaborate-
[820.91s -> 822.27s]  I don't want that in my room.
[823.42s -> 824.30s]  No, I don't wa-
[824.30s -> 825.02s]  I don't want it.
[825.66s -> 839.23s]  I feel psycho.
[839.23s -> 841.63s]  I don't want you guys to see any of this shit above my face, whatever.
[842.51s -> 844.57s]  All right, we're going right into it.
[844.57s -> 845.07s]  Super hard.
[857.30s -> 857.80s]  All right.
[863.01s -> 865.73s]  Ooh, that little jump down there almost screwed it all up.
[869.38s -> 869.88s]  Patrick!
[870.74s -> 872.42s]  This guy sucks, Ernest!
[893.76s -> 894.26s]  Get in it!
[909.82s -> 911.82s]  How the fuck am I supposed to do that?
[912.38s -> 914.54s]  Holy shit, how did I get to 47 last night?
[914.54s -> 915.98s]  I have no idea.
[916.86s -> 918.80s]  How on earth did I do that?
[924.03s -> 928.34s]  Oh, Ashley's not in here.
[928.34s -> 928.84s]  Yeah.
[934.18s -> 935.70s]  Washed up from one day ago.
[942.62s -> 943.12s]  Part two.
[944.21s -> 946.21s]  NOOOOO-
[946.21s -> 947.41s]  I'm not warmed up at all.
[948.78s -> 950.22s]  I got to do one more site-
[950.22s -> 950.72s]  Okay.
[951.26s -> 954.75s]  That team sucked.
[954.75s -> 955.71s]  It was a bad team.
[955.71s -> 956.43s]  I'm not-
[956.43s -> 957.31s]  I was a bad team.
[958.27s -> 959.94s]  Now I got the good team.
[960.50s -> 961.38s]  I got the good team.
[961.38s -> 962.02s]  I'm ready to go.
[963.97s -> 965.33s]  Change the character noises.
[965.33s -> 968.13s]  I will, after like five more attempts, I promise.
[968.13s -> 972.48s]  Okay, I gotta lean back and relax.
[973.12s -> 974.24s]  I'm leaning back and relaxing.
[974.64s -> 975.14s]  Watch.
[975.76s -> 981.01s]  I had to go above.
[981.01s -> 981.97s]  Holy shit, Ernest, go off.
[1009.55s -> 1018.26s]  Oh, he's holding a paper airplane!
[1042.75s -> 1043.87s]  Oh, come on!
[1043.87s -> 1044.37s]  What?
[1049.28s -> 1050.64s]  Oh my fucking god, why?
[1053.23s -> 1054.11s]  Shit, some of these-
[1054.11s -> 1055.71s]  Some of these this fast are impossible.
[1058.26s -> 1062.50s]  Some of these minigames this fast are actually like not even possible with the 2D characters.
[1086.69s -> 1087.57s]  All right, we're going original.
[1088.45s -> 1091.65s]  All right, let's try this.
[1093.17s -> 1094.29s]  Are you getting better?
[1094.29s -> 1095.09s]  I gotta get-
[1095.09s -> 1095.81s]  I gotta warm up.
[1096.45s -> 1105.92s]  The ones where it's like rock the baby, they give you like a full one second.
[1106.96s -> 1109.78s]  I get like maybe a 10th of a second.
[1109.78s -> 1111.22s]  You gotta rock up like eight times.
[1111.86s -> 1118.00s]  That's the last car.
[1163.92s -> 1164.72s]  Oh my god, stop.
[1164.72s -> 1165.92s]  I'm not getting electrocuted.
[1165.92s -> 1166.42s]  I'm fine.
[1176.51s -> 1196.50s]  That's cheating?
[1196.50s -> 1197.30s]  How?
[1197.30s -> 1202.86s]  I didn't hear!
[1230.42s -> 1230.92s]  Oh yeah.
[1234.50s -> 1235.62s]  That's not fucking possible.
[1239.30s -> 1240.58s]  That's not possible.
[1240.58s -> 1241.86s]  Seriously, the time-
[1241.86s -> 1243.78s]  The wait for the beat?
[1245.78s -> 1248.10s]  Like, the fuck are you supposed to do that?
[1249.81s -> 1251.17s]  Oh, get the rhythm here.
[1252.67s -> 1253.17s]  Huh?
[1284.37s -> 1286.37s]  I want to see the clip where that hit me.
[1287.01s -> 1293.22s]  I'd like to see the hitbox.
[1293.86s -> 1295.06s]  I want to see the clip where that hit me.
[1305.15s -> 1305.71s]  Desync.
[1305.71s -> 1306.83s]  I'm not desynced.
[1311.17s -> 1311.89s]  It's a shitty-
[1312.93s -> 1313.43s]  Watch.
[1314.29s -> 1323.25s]  Desync.
[1323.25s -> 1324.13s]  You're a liar.
[1330.51s -> 1334.03s]  The desync is a shitty webcam that can't be in a room
[1334.75s -> 1338.35s]  that doesn't have a fucking gigantic ring light in your face.
[1338.99s -> 1340.77s]  All right, let me see, let me see.
[1340.77s -> 1341.27s]  What happened?
[1341.89s -> 1347.62s]  It's the webcam, it just sucks.
[1347.62s -> 1349.22s]  And this is not even an old webcam.
[1349.86s -> 1369.79s]  I actually don't-
[1369.79s -> 1371.23s]  I don't mind the guys going that way.
[1371.23s -> 1372.83s]  It looks pissed.
[1372.83s -> 1374.43s]  I'm pissed at webcam technology.
[1375.15s -> 1381.58s]  I have an opinion that they just made all the webcams they've ever made
[1381.58s -> 1382.94s]  10 years ago and just didn't make anymore.
[1395.68s -> 1397.52s]  Okay, the worst part about WarioWare for Switch
[1398.16s -> 1399.12s]  is because they've changed-
[1399.12s -> 1401.60s]  Because you have to be the 2D character,
[1401.60s -> 1404.24s]  it's like you move the character and like it's-
[1404.24s -> 1408.64s]  A lot of these minigames you need to take like a second to know where to move,
[1408.64s -> 1413.47s]  but like you have to move it so quickly within like a second.
[1413.47s -> 1421.84s]  That's like, how the fuck am I supposed to do that without-
[1421.84s -> 1425.28s]  Like all these minigames require you to control the 2D character jumping around.
[1425.84s -> 1429.84s]  But if you move even a small amount in that minigame,
[1429.84s -> 1431.04s]  you fucking ruin the whole thing.
[1431.92s -> 1435.31s]  Fucking GameCube one was better.
[1436.03s -> 1446.56s]  Listen to the prompt.
[1446.56s -> 1449.12s]  Okay, let me tell you something about the prompt.
[1449.12s -> 1449.84s]  You ready for the prompt?
[1450.64s -> 1455.22s]  If I screamed in your ear an action for you to do,
[1456.10s -> 1462.80s]  I scream in your ear and you have two tenths of a second to do that action.
[1462.80s -> 1463.52s]  You're gonna freak out.
[1464.16s -> 1466.18s]  You're gonna be like, what did he say?
[1466.18s -> 1467.14s]  What number?
[1467.14s -> 1468.90s]  And I'm gonna laugh at you when you get it wrong.
[1486.69s -> 1489.14s]  To like, you see what I mean?
[1489.14s -> 1490.66s]  Like, what the fuck, man?
[1551.22s -> 1553.38s]  It's like they're just moving the character around.
[1554.80s -> 1557.84s]  It's like moving the character physically across the plane.
[1557.84s -> 1559.92s]  Like, it's just like, it's-
[1559.92s -> 1560.88s]  What the fuck?
[1562.82s -> 1565.22s]  Like, I have to go up and around into the left-
[1566.02s -> 1583.44s]  Here we go.
[1618.43s -> 1619.79s]  God damn it, I tried to-
[1623.01s -> 1623.57s]  You see what I mean?
[1626.26s -> 1627.94s]  Like moving the characters around is so-
[1645.44s -> 1646.88s]  Fucking God, I hate it.
[1693.58s -> 1694.06s]  I got it.
[1699.06s -> 1702.48s]  It's this one.
[1765.87s -> 1771.39s]  Oh, needing to know like what side you have to move the character is so fucking painful.
[1774.77s -> 1777.73s]  It's like, okay, so right at the very beginning you gotta move quick,
[1777.73s -> 1779.25s]  either left or right with everybody.
[1779.81s -> 1781.49s]  So it's like, all right, what is the game?
[1782.05s -> 1783.01s]  What's going on?
[1783.01s -> 1785.97s]  And what direction do I have to hold the analog?
[1785.97s -> 1819.55s]  I had it.
[1819.55s -> 1822.43s]  Might fuck around and believe in Jerma.
[1822.43s -> 1827.70s]  Now's the time to do it.
[1829.04s -> 1829.92s]  Now's the time to do it.
[1855.81s -> 1861.63s]  Don't lose faith just yet.
[1861.63s -> 1866.98s]  I covered it with my face.
[1874.83s -> 1877.55s]  Yeah, I like, I'm trying just to press the button,
[1877.55s -> 1880.67s]  but moving the fuck around in this game sucks asshole.
[1917.31s -> 1920.58s]  This game's not tuned correctly to do the super hard.
[1920.58s -> 1922.02s]  The game's not tuned correctly.
[1922.66s -> 1924.67s]  With a 2D game, you gotta play with 2D characters.
[1924.67s -> 1927.71s]  The first full second is you trying to figure out what fucking character you are
[1927.71s -> 1932.56s]  and what direction you need to move and can that character even do the mini game?
[1932.56s -> 1933.76s]  This is not tuned for this.
[1933.76s -> 1936.00s]  They- This is a fucking extra mode they put on.
[1936.00s -> 1937.28s]  It was never tuned for it.
[1961.90s -> 1962.40s]  This is the one.
[1962.86s -> 1966.93s]  Hey, I'm just telling you right now, bet all your money on this next run.
[1969.60s -> 1970.64s]  Bet it all.
[1970.64s -> 1972.00s]  I'm telling you, I'm gonna get it.
[1972.00s -> 1973.12s]  Bet every cent you have.
[1979.65s -> 1980.77s]  It's so annoying.
[1980.77s -> 1989.57s]  I think some motherfuckers just go so much faster than others.
[1989.57s -> 1992.29s]  Like, do people have different fucking speeds?
[1992.29s -> 1993.97s]  Like, it's- For a game that takes one-
[1996.83s -> 1997.87s]  And that's cheating apparently.
[2001.78s -> 2003.46s]  Some people look faster than others.
[2004.18s -> 2012.43s]  This game's a six.
[2012.43s -> 2018.88s]  Let's see if it can build back and come back to like a 7.9.
[2018.88s -> 2021.14s]  Let's see if they can build it back to a 7.9 for me.
[2021.14s -> 2021.70s]  Let's find out.
[2033.22s -> 2034.58s]  He said go all in.
[2045.01s -> 2047.73s]  What's the point of having half of these characters in the game
[2047.73s -> 2049.41s]  if only three of them are any good?
[2052.43s -> 2056.80s]  Let's go.
[2056.80s -> 2057.52s]  All right, this is the team.
[2057.52s -> 2058.32s]  This is gonna be this-
[2058.32s -> 2059.52s]  This is the team.
[2059.52s -> 2060.40s]  This is the team.
[2060.40s -> 2061.04s]  This is the run.
[2061.04s -> 2061.60s]  This is the team.
[2061.60s -> 2062.24s]  Bet everything.
[2062.24s -> 2064.00s]  I- I would- Don't listen to me.
[2064.00s -> 2087.38s]  This is the one.
[2087.38s -> 2088.26s]  Bet everything on this one.
[2088.82s -> 2101.92s]  All right, this is the one.
[2101.92s -> 2102.96s]  Definitely bet on this one.
[2102.96s -> 2108.18s]  I- I- My controller got stuck.
[2120.29s -> 2120.77s]  Bet it all.
[2120.77s -> 2121.33s]  All of it.
[2121.33s -> 2139.54s]  Your whole bank account on this one.
[2139.54s -> 2140.98s]  You're supposed to do that with some characters.
[2162.46s -> 2162.96s]  Ah!
[2197.01s -> 2200.67s]  But we're lives in the ocean.
[2200.67s -> 2201.17s]  That one.
[2211.58s -> 2226.70s]  That defogged his face!
[2258.30s -> 2283.38s]  Super airplane.
[2283.38s -> 2294.18s]  Fuck it!
[2294.18s -> 2295.14s]  That character!
[2295.14s -> 2296.10s]  That character's like-
[2296.10s -> 2297.06s]  Why am I supposed to-
[2297.06s -> 2297.62s]  What are you-
[2297.62s -> 2298.12s]  What?
[2298.34s -> 2298.98s]  That character-
[2298.98s -> 2299.86s]  That character's like-
[2299.86s -> 2300.36s]  I was like-
[2323.76s -> 2324.40s]  It changed-
[2324.40s -> 2324.90s]  Okay.
[2325.73s -> 2327.71s]  Here's my complaint.
[2327.71s -> 2332.46s]  Some characters changed the actual level.
[2332.46s -> 2333.66s]  And in WarioWare,
[2334.14s -> 2336.86s]  memorizing a level is incredibly important.
[2336.86s -> 2338.14s]  And if you have a different character
[2338.14s -> 2340.46s]  and that motherfucker changes the whole level-
[2342.30s -> 2344.14s]  Oh, I don't think so!
[2344.14s -> 2345.10s]  Oh my god!
[2345.10s -> 2346.46s]  Forty fucking nine!
[2348.29s -> 2349.33s]  My god!
[2349.33s -> 2349.97s]  But he was-
[2349.97s -> 2352.13s]  Oh my goodness!
[2352.85s -> 2354.13s]  You've gotta be kidding me.
[2355.01s -> 2361.04s]  Oh my god!
[2361.04s -> 2362.40s]  It was forty nine.
[2362.40s -> 2363.68s]  You've gotta be kidding me.
[2363.68s -> 2364.56s]  The one that was like-
[2364.56s -> 2365.52s]  Oh, you're gonna shoot?
[2365.52s -> 2369.52s]  Hold on to the ring as it changes the fucking whole level.
[2375.23s -> 2377.07s]  Oh, I'm so disappointed.
[2377.79s -> 2382.18s]  Got there once, I'd get there again.
[2382.82s -> 2389.38s]  I'm going for it.
[2389.38s -> 2389.88s]  No.
[2390.10s -> 2391.06s]  Fuck the haters.
[2391.06s -> 2392.50s]  I'm going in with eighteen vote.
[2393.06s -> 2408.70s]  You're a three.
[2409.50s -> 2411.01s]  Relax.
[2411.81s -> 2412.77s]  Everybody relax.
[2412.77s -> 2414.77s]  Put every cent you own on this guy.
[2444.70s -> 2446.06s]  Why wouldn't he move his arms?
[2446.06s -> 2446.56s]  I-
[2473.14s -> 2473.86s]  Forty nine!
[2473.86s -> 2474.66s]  It's still in my brain.
[2491.22s -> 2491.94s]  Rent three.
[2493.14s -> 2505.54s]  Worst fucking character to do this with, really.
[2511.95s -> 2529.25s]  Fire you motherfucker!
[2529.25s -> 2530.45s]  What are you doing?
[2530.45s -> 2531.25s]  What?
[2531.25s -> 2531.89s]  What the hell?
[2533.41s -> 2533.97s]  Okay.
[2533.97s -> 2534.53s]  Okay.
[2534.53s -> 2535.57s]  What the fuck?
[2538.19s -> 2540.35s]  You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
[2540.35s -> 2540.67s]  What?
[2540.67s -> 2543.63s]  Like, I'm pressing A and she's not firing.
[2548.24s -> 2553.17s]  Does this thing have a battery?
[2553.17s -> 2554.29s]  I've charged them overnight.
[2555.01s -> 2558.43s]  Okay, we're doing a fuckface team.
[2558.43s -> 2558.93s]  Don't care.
[2559.79s -> 2563.78s]  It's goddamn Switch controllers.
[2564.42s -> 2588.32s]  Right, it's the controllers.
[2588.32s -> 2589.20s]  Yeah, it is the controllers.
[2593.36s -> 2595.36s]  Focusing with every cent you own on this.
[2598.14s -> 2599.34s]  Every cent you have for channel friends.
[2599.34s -> 2599.84s]  Oh.
[2617.28s -> 2617.78s]  I just burped.
[2618.74s -> 2620.47s]  People are gonna get just like, pew.
[2635.52s -> 2636.56s]  Yeah, that's unfair.
[2636.56s -> 2637.52s]  Okay, what's the RNG?
[2637.52s -> 2638.02s]  What's the-
[2638.48s -> 2639.84s]  What's the fucking RNG on that one?
[2639.84s -> 2640.72s]  What's the RNG on that one?
[2640.72s -> 2642.00s]  You put Snake on top of the-
[2642.72s -> 2644.88s]  You can put Snake-
[2644.88s -> 2645.38s]  Whatever.
[2651.89s -> 2653.73s]  No, you fucking dumb donkey.
[2667.94s -> 2672.26s]  I'm just trying to move my character across the goddamn screen, dude.
[2672.26s -> 2674.58s]  I'm just trying to move the guy.
[2674.58s -> 2675.06s]  I don't-
[2675.06s -> 2676.10s]  Oh, man, hold on.
[2676.10s -> 2677.38s]  2D WarioWare.
[2677.38s -> 2678.02s]  Move guy.
[2678.90s -> 2679.40s]  Oops.
[2709.01s -> 2718.71s]  You just get stuck in this shit, like-
[2727.27s -> 2727.77s]  I-
[2740.74s -> 2741.54s]  Three, one-
[2742.74s -> 2743.38s]  I gotta start over.
[2743.38s -> 2743.88s]  It's not gonna work.
[2745.56s -> 2747.24s]  I got two more lives.
[2747.24s -> 2747.74s]  It's not gonna-
[2751.12s -> 2751.86s]  I'm not gonna do it.
[2754.28s -> 2756.28s]  Dude, I can't even fucking move.
[2756.28s -> 2756.78s]  I can't even-
[2757.80s -> 2761.14s]  Like, some of these minigames, you get like, stuck on a fucking pixel,
[2761.14s -> 2762.02s]  and then like, it's over.
[2762.02s -> 2762.52s]  You just lose.
[2776.92s -> 2779.99s]  Remember when you just had to go like this?
[2779.99s -> 2780.71s]  Or like this?
[2781.73s -> 2782.45s]  Or like this?
[2785.68s -> 2786.48s]  Or like that?
[2812.08s -> 2812.56s]  I know.
[2812.56s -> 2813.92s]  I can't believe I got to 49.
[2813.92s -> 2814.56s]  I'm so mad.
[2817.68s -> 2819.76s]  There was like a Satan sitting on my shoulder,
[2819.76s -> 2821.12s]  whispering in my ear, just going,
[2821.12s -> 2822.16s]  49.
[2822.16s -> 2822.80s]  49.
[2822.80s -> 2824.32s]  You fucked it up, didn't you?
[2824.32s -> 2825.12s]  49.
[2825.12s -> 2826.32s]  You could have just moved on.
[2830.08s -> 2831.60s]  Why can't I fucking touch-
[2831.60s -> 2832.10s]  What?!
[2834.77s -> 2836.45s]  Why wouldn't it flip up?
[2836.45s -> 2840.12s]  It flipped the other one up, but it wouldn't flip the middle one up?
[2840.12s -> 2841.64s]  I literally touched it with my head.
[2885.06s -> 2886.26s]  This is definitely not the one.
[2886.26s -> 2887.06s]  I'm not gonna be able to do it.
[2887.06s -> 2887.56s]  I can't do it.
[2888.18s -> 2889.06s]  I can't.
[2889.06s -> 2889.94s]  I can't do it.
[2889.94s -> 2891.22s]  I can't do it, guys.
[2891.22s -> 2891.94s]  I can't do it.
[2892.74s -> 2896.32s]  Do not bet on this one.
[2896.32s -> 2897.44s]  I'm gonna lose this one for sure.
[2897.44s -> 2897.94s]  Guaranteed.
[2921.76s -> 2922.56s]  There's no way I do it.
[2925.75s -> 2926.15s]  No way.
[2926.79s -> 2934.50s]  Guaranteed to lose it.
[2934.50s -> 2935.00s]  Dude!
[2943.41s -> 2945.89s]  Dude, yes, it's so fucking annoying.
[2947.40s -> 2948.52s]  Like, you try to get over there,
[2948.52s -> 2949.24s]  and he's gonna get like-
[2969.40s -> 2970.44s]  Wrong way!
[2970.44s -> 2971.48s]  I can't even move the other way.
[3000.96s -> 3015.94s]  God, it's like the characters have made it a fucking grease.
[3015.94s -> 3018.66s]  They're gonna patch this game in like a fucking two or three weeks.
[3018.66s -> 3020.80s]  They're gonna realize this is-
[3020.80s -> 3022.48s]  Humans couldn't do this past level 50.
[3024.90s -> 3025.38s]  Is it gonna go-
[3025.38s -> 3027.22s]  Oh, shit, we need to add like an extra half second for you
[3027.22s -> 3029.30s]  to decide what way you have to run first.
[3030.18s -> 3031.59s]  I wouldn't even pay attention.
[3034.93s -> 3040.77s]  This guy's gonna get patched.
[3040.77s -> 3041.33s]  They're gonna patch this.
[3041.33s -> 3041.89s]  They're gonna realize like,
[3041.89s -> 3043.57s]  oh, why is super hard mode in this game?
[3043.57s -> 3045.25s]  It's not even fucking tuned correctly.
[3045.25s -> 3045.89s]  Okay, okay.
[3045.89s -> 3048.68s]  Yeah, it's gonna be like,
[3048.68s -> 3049.88s]  oh, we saw the streamer of this guy,
[3049.88s -> 3052.52s]  German985, twitch.tv slash German985.
[3053.32s -> 3057.04s]  We realized our absolute faults as developers.
[3058.00s -> 3060.40s]  Once he got to 47, 49,
[3060.40s -> 3062.32s]  I mean, he's like one of the greatest gamers on the platform.
[3064.18s -> 3065.70s]  It's just not possible for people to do it.
[3066.90s -> 3071.00s]  So, they'll probably patch the game,
[3071.00s -> 3073.40s]  and then they'll realize everything was incorrect.
[3136.50s -> 3138.10s]  That one's so impossible.
[3140.15s -> 3141.11s]  You can't do that one.
[3163.59s -> 3164.95s]  Just fucking why?
[3172.20s -> 3174.76s]  This game's not built to be able to play it this fast.
[3181.51s -> 3182.79s]  Oh, my God.
[3183.59s -> 3193.84s]  It's not built to be able to go this fast.
[3196.93s -> 3199.49s]  Some of these fucking characters require a full second to even do anything.
[3200.29s -> 3229.89s]  Wow, Jeremy, you kind of suck, lol.
[3233.67s -> 3234.47s]  They're baiting me.
[3234.47s -> 3235.19s]  Don't let them bait you.
[3236.07s -> 3240.12s]  But like, do you understand my problem?
[3241.24s -> 3241.96s]  Like, this shit.
[3297.08s -> 3298.76s]  It's not supposed to play in this mode.
[3301.28s -> 3303.84s]  All right, the whole game was like tuned accordingly.
[3303.84s -> 3305.92s]  This one is definitely not.
[3306.64s -> 3308.32s]  Without fucking question.
[3313.54s -> 3333.86s]  I can't believe I got 40 fucking 9.
[3350.24s -> 3350.80s]  New technique.
[3354.02s -> 3354.66s]  New technique.
[3354.66s -> 3355.16s]  I'm coming.
[3467.40s -> 3467.90s]  What?
[3483.24s -> 3484.68s]  Jesus Christ, man.
[3484.68s -> 3489.96s]  Some of the characters are just not designed to play certain minigames in one full second.
[3491.44s -> 3494.40s]  So, a bunch of these characters are just not designed
[3494.40s -> 3497.92s]  to do half of these minigames in the time that Super Hard gives you.
[3497.92s -> 3499.60s]  You get my drift?
[3517.14s -> 3518.42s]  Believers crying.
[3521.44s -> 3523.36s]  Like, holy fucking moly, man.
[3528.24s -> 3530.24s]  That was going so well.
[3530.24s -> 3531.60s]  You have to have five people.
[3531.60s -> 3533.92s]  Like, why can't I just play it with one person?
[3534.72s -> 3549.72s]  Like, every other character on this list that's not a shooter flyer
[3551.80s -> 3555.24s]  requires a full second of your brain to even understand
[3555.24s -> 3560.84s]  which way you have to go to do their weird technique to complete the flip and minigame.
[3567.52s -> 3568.64s]  I almost said the F word.
[3570.42s -> 3572.02s]  That never happens on this channel.
[3572.74s -> 3580.36s]  I almost said it.
[3580.36s -> 3581.08s]  I'm really sorry.
[3581.72s -> 3582.60s]  That came really close.
[3627.97s -> 3631.41s]  But do you understand that that level in particular,
[3631.41s -> 3634.61s]  it takes a full second for all the characters to even move the water.
[3634.61s -> 3638.13s]  You go slower and you have to get like out of the fuck you have to like go around.
[3638.13s -> 3641.41s]  It's by the time you know what you're doing, it's fucking over.
[3641.41s -> 3662.04s]  How is it the characters suck?
[3662.04s -> 3664.69s]  Like, why would I put nine volt in here?
[3665.57s -> 3666.61s]  Let's put nine volt in here.
[3666.61s -> 3666.93s]  Watch.
[3667.49s -> 3669.25s]  Why would I ever use the shitty character?
[3669.25s -> 3669.97s]  There's no reason to.
[3671.01s -> 3674.93s]  You don't get extra gosh darn points for playing as nine volt.
[3674.93s -> 3675.43s]  What?
[3723.76s -> 3729.24s]  Okay.
[3729.24s -> 3729.74s]  Everyone.
[3730.30s -> 3731.42s]  Do you get it?
[3731.42s -> 3733.74s]  Do you understand why like some of these characters should never play with?
[3736.58s -> 3738.18s]  This should change the whole minigame.
[3739.35s -> 3740.63s]  Changes the entire minigame.
[3740.63s -> 3741.75s]  That's the thing about WarioWare.
[3741.75s -> 3742.47s]  It's got to be the same.
[3742.47s -> 3745.11s]  So you can fucking know what the fuck you got to do when you get it in your brain.
[3745.11s -> 3746.39s]  Like, why would you change the whole minigame?
[3747.67s -> 3756.26s]  That's the point?
[3776.58s -> 3778.58s]  I had 40 fucking nine.
[3779.30s -> 3784.36s]  Can you get past 35?
[3785.24s -> 3786.28s]  Whoa, we're going down.
[3788.34s -> 3790.18s]  You guys lost even more confidence.
[3790.18s -> 3790.66s]  Wait, hold on.
[3790.66s -> 3791.22s]  This one doesn't.
[3791.22s -> 3791.62s]  No, no, no, no.
[3791.62s -> 3792.10s]  This one doesn't count.
[3792.10s -> 3792.66s]  This one doesn't count.
[3793.54s -> 3794.98s]  I'm noticing that we're going down to 35.
[3794.98s -> 3796.02s]  You guys have lost all confidence.
[3797.11s -> 3797.91s]  This is still going.
[3797.91s -> 3799.11s]  You don't have to delete this one.
[3799.11s -> 3800.15s]  We're just still going.
[3800.15s -> 3802.71s]  I had to reset that because I can't believe that I'm being taken down.
[3810.60s -> 3813.85s]  That way, I'm just going to stop that one.
[3813.85s -> 3814.73s]  Now I know what I have to go for.
[3816.47s -> 3828.54s]  It's so finicky.
[3828.54s -> 3868.02s]  It really is.
[3900.30s -> 3901.50s]  Yo, damn.
[3902.38s -> 3927.96s]  Get out of the fucking train, Wario.
[3928.60s -> 3956.02s]  God, it's like some of those are just so impossible to do in that small amount of time.
[4000.07s -> 4004.47s]  It's just needing to move these motherfuckers around like that
[4005.03s -> 4006.95s]  and like in awkward directions.
[4007.83s -> 4008.07s]  Fuck.
[4013.50s -> 4014.30s]  Make it 40.
[4023.22s -> 4026.50s]  Like having to like analog around and then touch this little area.
[4026.50s -> 4028.02s]  It's just like fuck, man.
[4028.02s -> 4028.74s]  Like this shit.
[4029.30s -> 4030.90s]  It's so finicky if you touch it.
[4030.90s -> 4031.30s]  It's like, wait.
[4104.04s -> 4107.08s]  That one's seriously that you can't fucking do that shit.
[4107.80s -> 4109.16s]  That's the stupidest one.
[4111.66s -> 4113.74s]  It takes way longer to even get over there.
[4116.44s -> 4117.48s]  That one's so dumb.
[4162.26s -> 4162.74s]  I've won.
[4162.74s -> 4163.14s]  I got it.
[4180.33s -> 4182.09s]  One, one, one, one, one.
[4182.09s -> 4182.89s]  What the fuck?
[4187.18s -> 4187.66s]  Why would they?
[4197.51s -> 4200.71s]  Dude, some of these are seriously stupid.
[4200.71s -> 4202.95s]  Like some of these are stupid.
[4213.43s -> 4215.59s]  Some of these are guaranteed losses.
[4215.59s -> 4227.88s]  I have to get it.
[4261.82s -> 4301.85s]  Do you understand how some of these are stupid and they don't make any fucking sense?
[4330.44s -> 4332.44s]  Some of them are so finicky.
[4417.70s -> 4420.58s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[4423.05s -> 4425.21s]  Defog, defog.
[4425.21s -> 4426.33s]  What do you mean?
[4426.33s -> 4427.93s]  Like I just, what?
[4428.89s -> 4435.26s]  I swear to God, some of these mini games are just dog shit.
[4435.98s -> 4438.42s]  It's just glasses.
[4441.30s -> 4441.62s]  Morty.
[4450.90s -> 4451.94s]  Fuck that, man.
[4455.88s -> 4457.96s]  And how would you expect me?
[4457.96s -> 4458.36s]  I'm fine.
[4458.36s -> 4459.16s]  I did it.
[4459.16s -> 4497.24s]  It don't even understand what some of these want you to even do.
[4498.20s -> 4500.89s]  I feel like some of these are so strange.
[4500.89s -> 4502.01s]  It's like, what are you talking about?
[4502.97s -> 4504.49s]  Shimmy, what the fuck are you talking about?
[4505.29s -> 4507.69s]  You have a tenth of a second to figure out what the fuck to do.
[4507.69s -> 4508.81s]  Shimmy, what's that mean?
[4510.49s -> 4512.25s]  It doesn't mean punch person inside.
[4513.05s -> 4517.16s]  I'm throwing this one in the trash.
[4517.16s -> 4517.48s]  It's over.
[4519.46s -> 4525.27s]  When you have that few time to understand what's even going on, it can't be that like, what?
[4526.15s -> 4529.59s]  And the characters, oh, I am fucking furious right now.
[4534.22s -> 4552.22s]  It is on.
[4552.22s -> 4555.66s]  Some characters just, they, their movement doesn't even make any sense for the game at hand.
[4556.30s -> 4568.34s]  Some of them like move faster.
[4568.34s -> 4569.22s]  Some of them are slow.
[4578.87s -> 4584.68s]  This is the one.
[4585.24s -> 4585.80s]  Walk it in.
[4590.14s -> 4592.46s]  That one needs to be patched.
[4592.46s -> 4594.70s]  That one needs to be patched.
[4594.70s -> 4596.54s]  That one needs to be patched.
[4596.54s -> 4598.30s]  That one needs to be patched.
[4599.32s -> 4600.76s]  That one needs to be.
[4601.40s -> 4633.05s]  A poor carpenter blames his tools.
[4633.61s -> 4635.61s]  Yeah, a poor carpenter blames the tools.
[4635.61s -> 4639.85s]  If you give me like a rubber children's mallet toy to build a fucking house with.
[4640.81s -> 4641.77s]  My voice, it's changed.
[4688.97s -> 4689.77s]  Patch that one too.
[4690.57s -> 4691.45s]  Patch that shit too.
[4691.45s -> 4692.65s]  That one doesn't make no sense to me either.
[4713.88s -> 4714.36s]  Fill in it.
[4714.36s -> 4714.84s]  Fill in it.
[4735.29s -> 4736.89s]  Put your fucking head over there.
[4750.55s -> 4751.67s]  Those ones are so stupid.
[4751.67s -> 4752.15s]  They're the worst.
[4802.78s -> 4804.06s]  No, I was trying to shoot the guy.
[4805.02s -> 4807.27s]  I was trying to.
[4808.55s -> 4815.46s]  Black.
[4816.10s -> 4823.46s]  Hang on.
[4832.54s -> 4833.82s]  Get over there, you fucking.
[4867.24s -> 4867.88s]  This carrot.
[4869.40s -> 4871.64s]  Why couldn't I fucking break it?
[4876.97s -> 4878.25s]  Why couldn't I break it?
[4880.07s -> 4885.11s]  You can't change the rules, Wario, where just you can't just change the rules like that.
[4890.23s -> 4892.55s]  A head bump breaks the fucking thing.
[4893.11s -> 4894.55s]  Don't change the rules on me.
[4910.42s -> 4912.10s]  I've only I didn't shoot like is the guy.
[4912.10s -> 4913.30s]  Oh, he only shoots this way.
[4913.78s -> 4914.18s]  Oh, yeah.
[4914.18s -> 4914.74s]  And I draw.
[4914.74s -> 4915.06s]  Whoops.
[4915.06s -> 4915.54s]  I didn't.
[4915.54s -> 4920.60s]  Oh, 47 again.
[4925.75s -> 4927.91s]  Oh, I keep coming so goddamn close.
[4942.55s -> 4942.87s]  Easy.
[4943.43s -> 4948.92s]  I love getting stuck on shit.
[4948.92s -> 4950.68s]  Great 2D character game in a Wario.
[4961.93s -> 4962.65s]  Fucking God.
[4964.01s -> 4965.93s]  Some of these are just impossible.
[4965.93s -> 4967.21s]  And I guess you have to live with that.
[4968.33s -> 4983.62s]  It's unfucking believable because you're going to end up getting.
[4983.62s -> 4986.02s]  Eventually, you're going to end up getting one of the mini games.
[4986.02s -> 4989.38s]  That's just like not possible with the character you're playing in the super hard mode.
[4992.70s -> 4994.78s]  You eventually going to get hit with a shitty scenario
[4994.78s -> 4995.98s]  where you can't even beat it with the guy.
[5001.02s -> 5028.54s]  I don't want to try the different characters because you like this game.
[5028.54s -> 5030.07s]  No, no, I hate it.
[5030.07s -> 5031.35s]  Actually, I think it's the worst one.
[5032.95s -> 5035.99s]  This is the worst game I played in the last 10 years, at least.
[5038.46s -> 5040.54s]  What a what a what a fucking flop.
[5057.00s -> 5059.64s]  Remember, guys, just call something a flop if you don't like it.
[5061.27s -> 5062.47s]  No, I do love this game.
[5062.47s -> 5063.11s]  I just think that it's.
[5064.31s -> 5068.39s]  I think it's fairly untuned for this particular game mode I'm trying to win.
[5072.89s -> 5074.33s]  Oh, what a fucking flop.
[5085.03s -> 5087.99s]  I'm telling you, it's going to sell fucking less than 10,000 copies.
[5097.11s -> 5101.29s]  All right, here we go.
[5151.98s -> 5157.86s]  Oh, what the fuck can't change the fucking rules.
[5158.50s -> 5164.18s]  You can't change the rules like I'm touching the what the fuck.
[5165.53s -> 5169.05s]  You can't change the fucking rules if I touch it.
[5288.84s -> 5326.55s]  Three, four.
[5326.55s -> 5327.99s]  Perfect fucking character for it.
[5327.99s -> 5328.79s]  Perfect character.
[5329.51s -> 5337.03s]  Let's go.
[5445.26s -> 5445.98s]  All right.
[5445.98s -> 5446.78s]  All right.
[5446.78s -> 5447.66s]  OK.
[5447.66s -> 5455.32s]  OK, got 73.
[5455.32s -> 5455.64s]  All right.
[5455.64s -> 5457.64s]  The game could jump back up to an 8.2.
[5457.64s -> 5459.82s]  It was six point.
[5459.82s -> 5462.86s]  It was six point two and that became an 8.2 again.
[5462.86s -> 5463.34s]  All right, good.
[5464.06s -> 5491.59s]  One more for the run.
[5492.39s -> 5493.19s]  One more for the road.
[5493.19s -> 5493.51s]  That's it.
[5493.51s -> 5500.68s]  I promise.
[5500.68s -> 5501.96s]  What a fucking flop.
[5501.96s -> 5505.74s]  What a fucking flop.
[5521.46s -> 5522.10s]  Hey, beat man.
[5522.10s -> 5523.70s]  Thanks for giving me these up.
[5523.70s -> 5532.84s]  I can literally only bet 10 channel points.
[5532.84s -> 5533.34s]  Great.
[5535.50s -> 5537.26s]  Oh, I don't know what you did, man.
[5547.50s -> 5548.14s]  This is impossible.
[5559.48s -> 5560.60s]  Yeah, right.
[5560.60s -> 5561.80s]  No fucking way.
[5561.80s -> 5562.92s]  Throw that girl the trash.
[5590.68s -> 5595.29s]  I got 73 points and I have nothing to prove anymore.
[5595.29s -> 5595.69s]  I win.
[5596.73s -> 5601.90s]  That was a wicked bank some moment.
[5605.80s -> 5606.60s]  Sit in the chair.
[5606.60s -> 5607.32s]  What are you dumb?
[5608.12s -> 5610.70s]  Couldn't get 100.
[5610.70s -> 5611.42s]  It's all right.
[5611.42s -> 5611.82s]  All right.
[5611.82s -> 5615.45s]  Let's how I want to try.
[5615.45s -> 5616.73s]  What do you mean first place?
[5616.73s -> 5620.92s]  Oh, I want to try this one real raw.
[5620.92s -> 5621.56s]  This is my voice.
[5622.84s -> 5623.40s]  Holy shit.
[5629.90s -> 5631.10s]  I'm so glad I had cricket.
[5631.10s -> 5632.38s]  Cricket is the only reason why I'm still here.
[5632.94s -> 5640.31s]  Check the leaderboard.
[5640.31s -> 5641.35s]  Oh, that's probably a daily game.
[5641.35s -> 5641.99s]  You're right.
[5641.99s -> 5642.79s]  This game is really good.
[5649.27s -> 5649.77s]  What?
[5651.38s -> 5655.66s]  I don't change the rules again.
[5657.56s -> 5658.28s]  Game over.
[5661.10s -> 5662.14s]  I'm not going to get 100.
[5662.14s -> 5662.86s]  No fucking way.
[5662.86s -> 5664.06s]  I'm not putting that on me.
[5664.62s -> 5667.99s]  The title of this stream is 50.
[5667.99s -> 5668.79s]  I'm not doing 100.
[5669.35s -> 5680.87s]  These are very hard.
[5685.53s -> 5686.65s]  Although I have time, though.
[5687.29s -> 5690.94s]  Oh, I feel like I'm playing a comp.
[5690.94s -> 5692.30s]  I feel like I'm in slow motion.
[5699.38s -> 5700.26s]  I don't understand.
[5700.90s -> 5702.12s]  Now I do.
[5702.12s -> 5707.02s]  I feel like I'm talking in slow motion, too,
[5707.02s -> 5709.02s]  as I was going too fast before.
[5709.82s -> 5711.32s]  See what I mean?
[5712.28s -> 5713.64s]  Everything is too slow.
[5720.07s -> 5721.35s]  Oh, that's weird.
[5722.07s -> 5725.19s]  I've been on x10 speed for the last hour and a half.
[5725.99s -> 5730.26s]  Both of them don't fail.
[5731.06s -> 5738.14s]  Holy shit.
[5738.14s -> 5738.70s]  These are hard.
[5739.26s -> 5740.12s]  All right.
[5740.12s -> 5741.72s]  I'm going to try to get 20 on this one.
[5741.72s -> 5742.52s]  20, I'll be happy.
[5748.42s -> 5750.02s]  Then I'm going to spend a bunch of my money and leave.
[5753.21s -> 5766.50s]  I'll be happy with 20.
[5789.29s -> 5790.09s]  Holy shit.
[5793.51s -> 5794.01s]  Oh.
[5796.63s -> 5819.19s]  Oh, funny.
[5819.19s -> 5819.75s]  Got it.
[5819.75s -> 5820.39s]  That was tough.
[5825.78s -> 5830.74s]  I, this is the, this is why I don't like the game.
[5830.74s -> 5832.66s]  I don't like when they make you move and you have to.
[5833.94s -> 5835.78s]  Like, you have to move in every one of these mini games
[5835.78s -> 5837.94s]  and it's just like, fuck, I moved a little bit and I did that.
[5837.94s -> 5838.42s]  I ended it.
[5840.62s -> 5841.12s]  Last round.
[5842.06s -> 5848.42s]  Like, I start every one of these ready to go.
[5853.29s -> 5853.79s]  Grab it.
[5864.57s -> 5867.88s]  Now we're doing this one ASMR.
[5868.44s -> 5871.88s]  Okay.
[5871.88s -> 5877.21s]  Today, I'm replaying WarioWare for the Nintendo Switch.
[5878.63s -> 5880.63s]  And I'm going to be, relax you.
[5880.63s -> 5882.07s]  I'm going to be really relaxing for you.
[5882.63s -> 5883.03s]  Okay.
[5883.03s -> 5885.27s]  So what we're going to do here is I'm going to try to get these things.
[5886.71s -> 5888.63s]  And exactly what I'm going to do here is I'm going to get this thing here.
[5888.63s -> 5889.59s]  The pill has been unveiled.
[5890.39s -> 5891.35s]  It's impossible.
[5892.57s -> 5893.69s]  Literally not completable.
[5894.25s -> 5895.53s]  It's literally not completable.
[5896.73s -> 5898.57s]  I was going to scream, but I don't want to do that.
[5898.57s -> 5900.65s]  All right.
[5900.65s -> 5901.15s]  One more try.
[5902.25s -> 5913.35s]  What kind of ASMR do you listen to?
[5913.35s -> 5913.85s]  I don't.
[5914.63s -> 5923.06s]  Anyway, that, that looks good right now.
[5923.06s -> 5925.14s]  Is that avocado toast with an egg on it?
[5925.14s -> 5925.94s]  Scrumptious.
[5929.46s -> 5930.74s]  That sounds good to me.
[5930.74s -> 5932.18s]  Scrumdiddlyumptious.
[5944.31s -> 5944.81s]  What?
[5945.43s -> 5947.19s]  That's what you guys are upset about now?
[5947.19s -> 5950.47s]  Is me saying that avocado toast looks scrumdiddlyumptious?
[5952.87s -> 5956.07s]  That's, that's what you want to say is the thing you don't like?
[5959.03s -> 5959.91s]  It was awful.
[5959.91s -> 5961.19s]  I, no, it wasn't.
[5963.29s -> 5964.01s]  Holy shit.
[5964.01s -> 5964.97s]  I think it's pink.
[5964.97s -> 5967.77s]  Yeah, it's pink.
[5989.38s -> 5990.90s]  Are they calling me Ned Flanders?
[5996.60s -> 6000.50s]  Oh, how am I Ned Flanders?
[6003.99s -> 6006.23s]  Oh, they move across the screen.
[6006.23s -> 6007.03s]  Of course they do.
[6007.03s -> 6007.53s]  One more.
[6008.63s -> 6009.27s]  All right.
[6009.27s -> 6009.77s]  I'm done.
[6010.39s -> 6010.89s]  One more.
[6011.51s -> 6012.87s]  One more and then I'm going to feed my friends.
[6025.74s -> 6026.70s]  I would not be betting on this.
[6026.70s -> 6028.62s]  I have not had any experience with half these minigames.
[6029.34s -> 6036.30s]  Why would you be betting on this?
[6041.50s -> 6041.74s]  What?
[6041.74s -> 6042.38s]  I don't get it.
[6045.14s -> 6045.64s]  Last one.
[6050.71s -> 6051.19s]  Trap two.
[6051.19s -> 6051.51s]  Do I wait?
[6051.51s -> 6054.95s]  Do I have to trap two individual or trap them both at the same time?
[6055.59s -> 6057.99s]  Got to be more clear about that, please.
[6065.08s -> 6065.64s]  Stop betting.
[6065.64s -> 6066.52s]  What's wrong with you guys?
[6081.50s -> 6082.30s]  Oh, shit.
[6089.90s -> 6091.64s]  Holy moly.
[6091.64s -> 6092.76s]  That was hard.
[6093.32s -> 6094.12s]  One more.
[6094.12s -> 6096.60s]  This is actually the last one.
[6096.60s -> 6097.24s]  I swear to God.
[6099.50s -> 6100.70s]  I'm getting 20 on this one.
[6100.70s -> 6101.98s]  I would bet on this one if I were you.
[6101.98s -> 6102.86s]  I'm telling you, I would do it.
[6103.98s -> 6108.76s]  If I were in the chat right now, I would bet that I was going to get 20.
[6108.76s -> 6109.26s]  I'm just saying.
[6124.84s -> 6128.25s]  I look like my face at the end.
[6165.51s -> 6166.01s]  What?
[6167.03s -> 6172.01s]  Wouldn't that be the big one and the small one?
[6178.49s -> 6179.53s]  I'll do this one with no lips.
[6181.66s -> 6182.30s]  I'm going to be better.
[6182.78s -> 6188.38s]  Finish.
[6193.54s -> 6194.90s]  One kernel.
[6202.02s -> 6202.90s]  Oh, my God.
[6204.02s -> 6209.94s]  Empty.
[6209.94s -> 6218.75s]  Finish.
[6223.90s -> 6227.75s]  Seek shelter.
[6228.79s -> 6234.15s]  It's me.
[6235.03s -> 6236.28s]  Watch out.
[6246.18s -> 6249.36s]  Hence.
[6267.22s -> 6267.72s]  Great.
[6284.23s -> 6284.73s]  Yo.
[6284.89s -> 6285.39s]  Yo.
[6290.88s -> 6291.68s]  Some of these.
[6291.68s -> 6292.40s]  Throw them in the trash.
[6292.96s -> 6293.84s]  Remove them.
[6293.84s -> 6294.40s]  Just get rid of them.
[6295.04s -> 6295.54s]  Wrong way.
[6296.68s -> 6297.18s]  Last one.
[6300.92s -> 6301.96s]  Some of those are stupid.
[6301.96s -> 6302.60s]  Just throw them away.
[6302.60s -> 6303.48s]  They don't even need to be in the game.
[6303.48s -> 6303.98s]  They're dumb.
[6317.26s -> 6317.82s]  You don't get to eat?
[6317.82s -> 6318.62s]  What's up with that?
[6320.92s -> 6322.12s]  I'm trying to make it to 20.
[6323.74s -> 6324.86s]  I don't have to make it to 20.
[6324.86s -> 6326.06s]  I don't care.
[6326.78s -> 6328.11s]  I really don't even care.
[6329.31s -> 6330.27s]  I don't care.
[6330.27s -> 6330.99s]  I don't even care.
[6333.23s -> 6333.95s]  Oh, my God.
[6334.75s -> 6335.63s]  Oh, my God.
[6335.63s -> 6336.51s]  These people think I care.
[6336.51s -> 6337.31s]  You think I care?
[6338.19s -> 6340.84s]  I was trying to...
[6340.84s -> 6341.80s]  Oh, I can jump up there.
[6349.63s -> 6351.87s]  These people in the chat think I care.
[6351.87s -> 6352.99s]  I don't even fucking care.
[6354.99s -> 6355.79s]  Holy shit, dude.
[6355.79s -> 6357.31s]  Like, I don't give a shit.
[6357.31s -> 6357.81s]  I don't care.
[6358.99s -> 6367.84s]  Oh, well, I'll be having pasta today.
[6384.25s -> 6385.37s]  End the stream if you don't care.
[6385.93s -> 6386.41s]  That's the thing.
[6386.41s -> 6387.69s]  That's the way you don't get.
[6387.69s -> 6390.17s]  I don't care enough about the stream,
[6390.17s -> 6392.09s]  and I don't care about not streaming for me to care.
[6392.89s -> 6394.62s]  Are you serious?
[6395.42s -> 6396.97s]  I don't care about not streaming.
[6396.97s -> 6398.01s]  I don't care about streaming either.
[6398.01s -> 6398.81s]  So what?
[6398.81s -> 6399.61s]  Balls in your court.
[6400.41s -> 6405.40s]  It's a big bunny.
[6410.33s -> 6411.37s]  Pink did not win.
[6411.37s -> 6411.87s]  Wait.
[6412.70s -> 6413.90s]  Oh, I think I got baited here.
[6415.63s -> 6416.13s]  Yeah.
[6416.67s -> 6417.15s]  No.
[6417.15s -> 6423.63s]  Perfect character for this.
[6424.27s -> 6426.59s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[6427.39s -> 6432.59s]  Oh, he didn't even care.
[6432.59s -> 6433.23s]  No, I don't even care.
[6440.20s -> 6440.92s]  Fucking frog.
[6441.56s -> 6459.42s]  I don't even care.
[6460.06s -> 6468.44s]  Oh, wait.
[6476.59s -> 6477.39s]  I'm so addicted.
[6477.39s -> 6478.11s]  I can't stop.
[6478.11s -> 6478.75s]  I know.
[6478.75s -> 6479.87s]  I'm having fun.
[6479.87s -> 6483.63s]  How am I supposed to tell the difference?
[6490.52s -> 6493.32s]  I talked a lot of shit today, but I'm not even serious.
[6493.96s -> 6494.60s]  I don't care.
[6498.59s -> 6511.13s]  Hold on.
[6511.13s -> 6511.85s]  I can do better than this.
[6543.13s -> 6543.63s]  Shut up.
[6547.28s -> 6548.80s]  I could have gone for so much longer.
[6548.80s -> 6550.48s]  I think people really actually hated that.
[6551.12s -> 6556.51s]  I could have gone for like another 30 to 40 full seconds.
[6559.37s -> 6563.77s]  I started seeing way more stop than way more cool, dude.
[6568.25s -> 6575.00s]  All right.
[6575.00s -> 6576.12s]  Let's go feed our friends.
[6576.12s -> 6587.16s]  So that was WarioWare.
[6587.16s -> 6588.04s]  That was really fun.
[6588.04s -> 6604.35s]  Ooh, legendary.
[6604.35s -> 6606.65s]  Come on.
[6606.65s -> 6608.89s]  I only got one legendary the whole time.
[6608.89s -> 6610.89s]  It's kind of horse shit.
[6611.45s -> 6617.36s]  Come on.
[6621.31s -> 6622.19s]  Legendary.
[6622.19s -> 6636.19s]  All right.
[6636.19s -> 6636.83s]  Wario.
[6636.83s -> 6637.87s]  Let's give you a present.
[6637.87s -> 6643.10s]  I'm going to assume that Wario probably likes the thing with the Wario truck.
[6643.92s -> 6644.56s]  Right?
[6644.56s -> 6646.28s]  He didn't like it.
[6653.28s -> 6655.60s]  Why wouldn't you like the truck with your face on it?
[6665.84s -> 6674.70s]  I know he likes meat and you have mission points, too.
[6674.70s -> 6675.02s]  Oh, shit.
[6675.02s -> 6675.82s]  That's right.
[6675.82s -> 6678.19s]  All right.
[6678.19s -> 6678.75s]  Let's go to...
[6680.11s -> 6681.47s]  Orbeeline.
[6681.47s -> 6681.87s]  What do you got?
[6682.59s -> 6690.00s]  What does Orbe...
[6690.56s -> 6692.24s]  The bowling pin, right?
[6692.24s -> 6692.72s]  Yeah.
[6692.72s -> 6706.84s]  I don't think Wario is capable of driving.
[6707.48s -> 6716.60s]  Okay.
[6716.60s -> 6717.32s]  Who wants the truck?
[6717.88s -> 6724.43s]  All right.
[6724.43s -> 6725.23s]  What about Mike?
[6725.23s -> 6730.09s]  Or for the guitar, right?
[6730.09s -> 6732.33s]  His favorite thing.
[6732.89s -> 6734.14s]  That's a lot of points.
[6737.87s -> 6738.75s]  I got a mission for that.
[6743.47s -> 6744.59s]  Music related.
[6744.59s -> 6745.55s]  Performance related.
[6745.55s -> 6746.27s]  Music related.
[6746.83s -> 6750.72s]  I don't think anything else here.
[6759.04s -> 6760.16s]  We have a lot of sports stuff.
[6764.27s -> 6765.23s]  Baseball.
[6765.23s -> 6769.40s]  Take the baby off.
[6769.40s -> 6769.64s]  I will.
[6769.64s -> 6770.92s]  I'll take it off.
[6770.92s -> 6780.03s]  You get mission rewards at level 15 for everybody.
[6780.03s -> 6780.43s]  Oh, shit.
[6780.43s -> 6781.23s]  That's good to know.
[6791.26s -> 6792.54s]  Any more sports?
[6792.54s -> 6797.45s]  I don't think so.
[6800.00s -> 6800.64s]  Boxing, though?
[6801.28s -> 6805.98s]  All right.
[6805.98s -> 6806.46s]  What about you?
[6808.00s -> 6808.88s]  Wedding dress, right?
[6808.88s -> 6809.12s]  Yep.
[6809.76s -> 6818.89s]  Okay.
[6819.53s -> 6820.73s]  Yeah, well, I'm going to look at all this stuff.
[6820.73s -> 6821.05s]  Don't worry.
[6823.39s -> 6824.59s]  What about this red gem?
[6825.23s -> 6829.68s]  It's literally her favorite thing.
[6830.24s -> 6830.80s]  Nice.
[6830.80s -> 6831.20s]  Got it.
[6831.76s -> 6837.56s]  Okay.
[6838.92s -> 6844.11s]  What about birthday cake?
[6844.67s -> 6844.91s]  Yeah.
[6845.55s -> 6846.27s]  I got three of these.
[6853.56s -> 6855.48s]  Mood change from the beginning of the stream to now?
[6856.04s -> 6857.71s]  I mean, what?
[6857.71s -> 6858.19s]  I mean, I...
[6858.19s -> 6858.83s]  Oh, football.
[6858.83s -> 6859.07s]  Mike.
[6859.87s -> 6862.16s]  No, not Mike.
[6862.16s -> 6862.56s]  Jimmy.
[6864.88s -> 6865.44s]  What?
[6865.44s -> 6868.80s]  I didn't go on an absolute tirade and tell you guys that this is literally...
[6868.80s -> 6871.52s]  The game's awful and it was a 6 out of 10 and it was a flop.
[6871.52s -> 6872.48s]  It was going to flop.
[6876.30s -> 6877.18s]  It's just venting.
[6877.18s -> 6878.78s]  It doesn't mean anything.
[6878.78s -> 6879.98s]  I'm not actually saying that.
[6882.20s -> 6882.92s]  I like this game.
[6882.92s -> 6883.64s]  I think it's really good.
[6884.36s -> 6885.69s]  It's not a flop.
[6885.69s -> 6886.09s]  It's good.
[6887.50s -> 6887.98s]  What'd I say, though?
[6887.98s -> 6889.66s]  It's the worst game to come out in the last 10 years.
[6891.42s -> 6891.82s]  That's not...
[6891.82s -> 6893.10s]  I mean, you know that's not even accurate.
[6893.10s -> 6894.06s]  How could that be accurate?
[6896.72s -> 6896.88s]  All right.
[6896.88s -> 6898.32s]  What about video game-related stuff?
[6906.67s -> 6907.95s]  I don't know if he's going to like any of this.
[6916.30s -> 6917.34s]  Who's construction?
[6919.50s -> 6919.98s]  Trigor?
[6922.49s -> 6923.53s]  Give Ashley food?
[6924.25s -> 6934.20s]  I mean, Ashley and Wari were like red meat or something.
[6934.76s -> 6941.29s]  Okay.
[6941.29s -> 6942.17s]  What about...
[6942.17s -> 6943.29s]  I mean, what is this, like, sushi?
[6946.11s -> 6947.79s]  Ashley's favorite thing is sushi.
[6947.79s -> 6948.59s]  That's her favorite food.
[6949.23s -> 6949.88s]  I don't know.
[6950.44s -> 6953.55s]  Okay.
[6953.55s -> 6954.27s]  What about mushrooms?
[6955.39s -> 6955.95s]  Holy shit.
[6955.95s -> 6956.83s]  You like those, too.
[6956.83s -> 6957.15s]  All right.
[6957.87s -> 6966.04s]  Okay.
[6969.21s -> 6970.33s]  What about like an afternoon tea?
[6971.63s -> 6971.95s]  All right.
[6971.95s -> 6972.19s]  Yeah.
[6972.83s -> 6978.96s]  Scallion?
[6979.68s -> 6984.19s]  Boiled egg?
[6985.60s -> 6986.24s]  Don't like eggs.
[6988.73s -> 6989.13s]  Candy?
[6989.93s -> 6990.17s]  Yeah.
[6991.45s -> 6991.85s]  Grapes?
[6993.93s -> 6994.65s]  Yeah.
[6994.65s -> 6995.21s]  Love grapes.
[6995.77s -> 6999.10s]  Why do you look like that?
[6999.74s -> 7000.57s]  I don't know.
[7000.57s -> 7001.61s]  Ask my mother.
[7002.25s -> 7007.10s]  Is this kind of food?
[7007.74s -> 7009.80s]  Oh, tuna fish.
[7009.80s -> 7010.36s]  Are you kidding me?
[7011.26s -> 7011.50s]  Yep.
[7012.06s -> 7014.73s]  Little 15, right?

[7032.46s -> 7032.70s]  Okay.
[7033.50s -> 7037.88s]  All right.
[7037.88s -> 7038.68s]  I'm done with Ashley.
[7039.40s -> 7044.51s]  Come on.
[7044.51s -> 7045.47s]  We're going to go through all these people.
[7045.47s -> 7045.79s]  Don't worry.
[7047.39s -> 7048.11s]  What about red?
[7048.83s -> 7051.47s]  Don't you just want to make the devil...
[7051.47s -> 7052.91s]  Don't you just want to make the devil mad?
[7053.55s -> 7054.41s]  Okay.
[7054.41s -> 7054.65s]  Wait.
[7054.65s -> 7055.37s]  Jimmy's close.
[7055.93s -> 7057.52s]  Obi-Wan is close.

[7063.96s -> 7064.20s]  I'm going to...
[7064.20s -> 7064.36s]  Okay.
[7064.36s -> 7065.16s]  I'm going to give him the crane.
[7065.72s -> 7067.16s]  I'm going to give Crygor the crane.
[7078.27s -> 7078.91s]  What about the...
[7080.43s -> 7081.24s]  You like these.
[7081.96s -> 7093.34s]  Helicopter?
[7093.34s -> 7093.82s]  No.
[7093.82s -> 7094.22s]  Painting.
[7097.74s -> 7098.54s]  Loves it.

[7107.31s -> 7108.35s]  Nine volt?
[7108.35s -> 7109.71s]  Likes the construction stuff?
[7110.35s -> 7110.96s]  All right.
[7110.96s -> 7112.00s]  Like, here's a helicopter.
[7112.72s -> 7114.70s]  He's a little kid.
[7115.50s -> 7120.49s]  That means you're going to like the truck, too, then, right?
[7125.45s -> 7126.33s]  Bicycle.
[7126.33s -> 7127.05s]  The toy truck.
[7128.76s -> 7129.32s]  The shoes.
[7130.04s -> 7132.16s]  The sunglasses, maybe.
[7135.02s -> 7135.26s]  Not a...
[7135.26s -> 7136.14s]  Probably not a cell phone.
[7137.87s -> 7138.11s]  Yeah.
[7138.11s -> 7138.83s]  Okay.
[7138.83s -> 7145.42s]  I'm not giving him the toilet.
[7146.97s -> 7147.77s]  I don't think that's accurate.
[7148.33s -> 7150.51s]  He loves bikes.
[7155.63s -> 7156.67s]  Definitely the high-tech shoes.
[7156.67s -> 7157.23s]  That's for sure.
[7157.95s -> 7161.26s]  Yeah.
[7161.26s -> 7162.44s]  All right.
[7162.44s -> 7162.76s]  Come on.
[7162.76s -> 7163.00s]  We...
[7163.00s -> 7163.96s]  I'm just going to give him the toilet.
[7164.52s -> 7165.90s]  He loves it.
[7166.54s -> 7168.72s]  All right.
[7168.72s -> 7169.76s]  I don't want to spend any more on him.
[7169.76s -> 7170.24s]  He's 15.
[7170.88s -> 7177.36s]  So who else likes the toilet that's not 15?
[7179.58s -> 7180.54s]  It's definitely Wario.
[7180.54s -> 7181.02s]  Has to be.
[7181.66s -> 7193.93s]  That's 14.
[7198.97s -> 7200.49s]  And we're just going to use...
[7200.49s -> 7201.45s]  Remember the boxing glove?
[7204.43s -> 7204.51s]  Wait.
[7204.51s -> 7205.79s]  I thought Wario liked to punch people.
[7208.73s -> 7209.93s]  Mustache catalog.
[7209.93s -> 7210.41s]  Yep.
[7210.41s -> 7212.54s]  I just got to get him to 15.
[7216.88s -> 7217.68s]  Wario 15.
[7221.79s -> 7224.19s]  Ah, just give him the other one, so he cares.
[7224.19s -> 7227.44s]  Okay.
[7228.32s -> 7230.22s]  So these remaining ones.
[7230.94s -> 7233.55s]  How about cricket?
[7234.11s -> 7236.86s]  How about deer scare?
[7237.74s -> 7238.62s]  This is soothing.
[7240.22s -> 7242.14s]  He didn't hate it, but he didn't love it.
[7246.52s -> 7247.00s]  Dumbbells?
[7250.65s -> 7251.37s]  Like training?
[7252.01s -> 7264.32s]  You're obsessed?
[7264.32s -> 7265.76s]  I mean, I'm just having fun, man.
[7266.56s -> 7269.18s]  Didn't like that one.
[7269.82s -> 7273.18s]  We'll just eat the apple core because nobody wants that.
[7273.90s -> 7277.50s]  What about the camera?
[7278.72s -> 7280.40s]  Oh, he doesn't like cameras at all.
[7280.40s -> 7280.96s]  He hates them.
[7282.80s -> 7283.34s]  All right.
[7283.34s -> 7284.30s]  Who would like a camera?
[7285.18s -> 7289.40s]  Mona?
[7289.96s -> 7297.72s]  All right.
[7297.72s -> 7300.44s]  Well, Mona, you're just literally getting all the rest of the items.
[7300.44s -> 7301.96s]  Because then I'm going to go get more money.
[7302.60s -> 7305.61s]  You like manhole covers?
[7306.33s -> 7308.49s]  Okay.
[7323.39s -> 7323.87s]  Ooh.
[7323.87s -> 7324.19s]  All right.
[7324.19s -> 7325.31s]  You like the glasses.
[7325.31s -> 7330.83s]  What about the cactus?
[7330.83s -> 7333.82s]  She seems to have liked everything so far.
[7335.55s -> 7336.43s]  She just likes everything.
[7338.59s -> 7338.83s]  Okay.
[7340.40s -> 7340.80s]  All right.
[7340.80s -> 7343.52s]  I need to go complete my quest so I get a shitload more money.
[7344.24s -> 7347.93s]  So I'm going to go back and complete my quest.
[7348.49s -> 7349.74s]  All right.
[7349.74s -> 7351.45s]  What have I got?
[7351.45s -> 7352.41s]  Oh my goodness.
[7352.41s -> 7353.13s]  Look at all this money.
[7354.09s -> 7355.77s]  I haven't come back to my quest rewards.
[7355.77s -> 7357.29s]  It's in like four hours of gameplay.
[7361.39s -> 7362.43s]  Unlock all games.
[7363.58s -> 7364.62s]  I haven't done this once.
[7370.62s -> 7371.42s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[7371.42s -> 7371.74s]  All right.
[7373.16s -> 7374.04s]  Score?
[7374.04s -> 7376.28s]  I have to have gotten something for doing 50.
[7381.32s -> 7384.20s]  Play high tech and story with the crew free earn at least 31.
[7384.92s -> 7387.79s]  Okay.
[7388.43s -> 7392.16s]  I'm going to score 46 or higher.
[7392.88s -> 7396.92s]  Play thrill ride with the crew five or at least 10 or higher.
[7400.92s -> 7402.44s]  I got to 50 in the other one.
[7402.44s -> 7403.00s]  Are you kidding me?
[7403.80s -> 7407.55s]  46 not 50.
[7407.55s -> 7407.87s]  Okay.
[7407.87s -> 7408.35s]  Well, whatever.
[7408.99s -> 7416.88s]  Clear it after spilling 30 pieces of food.
[7417.44s -> 7418.57s]  Okay.
[7418.57s -> 7419.29s]  Troll the credits.
[7419.29s -> 7420.41s]  I don't want to.
[7420.41s -> 7421.28s]  All right.
[7421.28s -> 7421.68s]  Here we go.
[7421.68s -> 7422.16s]  Ooh.

[7440.76s -> 7447.23s]  I'm not.
[7447.23s -> 7447.63s]  No, no, no.
[7447.87s -> 7449.23s]  We're going to open 10 times.
[7449.23s -> 7456.44s]  Whereas do some legendaries.
[7457.24s -> 7461.20s]  I'll take it.
[7461.20s -> 7472.03s]  Come on.
[7474.12s -> 7474.84s]  Legendary.
[7474.84s -> 7475.72s]  Five stars.
[7475.72s -> 7476.84s]  Five stars.
[7476.84s -> 7497.31s]  What the fuck?
[7507.40s -> 7507.80s]  Yes.
[7507.80s -> 7510.06s]  I got a crown.
[7510.06s -> 7511.98s]  Five star golden crown.
[7514.64s -> 7515.68s]  That's going to be big money.
[7516.40s -> 7518.99s]  What a whale.
[7523.77s -> 7524.01s]  All right.
[7524.01s -> 7524.89s]  Let's do it.
[7524.89s -> 7526.33s]  I'm ready to level up again.
[7526.33s -> 7527.69s]  And now I'm going to level up other people to 15.
[7527.69s -> 7529.77s]  We're going to the cycle continues for at least another 10 minutes.
[7533.87s -> 7534.43s]  All right.
[7534.43s -> 7536.03s]  Who wants the golden crown?
[7536.75s -> 7542.51s]  Okay.
[7542.51s -> 7543.39s]  You need to get to 15.
[7546.97s -> 7547.93s]  Expensive vase.
[7549.16s -> 7549.72s]  Wario.
[7550.44s -> 7551.24s]  A real head turner.
[7551.24s -> 7553.24s]  Great for folks with a take charge attitude.
[7558.03s -> 7558.91s]  Well, I know you like.
[7558.91s -> 7559.87s]  No, you don't like this.
[7559.87s -> 7560.43s]  What do you like?
[7564.00s -> 7564.96s]  You like dumbbells.
[7565.68s -> 7568.91s]  It's going to be Wario.
[7580.56s -> 7581.04s]  Ashley.
[7581.76s -> 7583.04s]  Wario is already 15 though.
[7585.52s -> 7586.32s]  In the soccer ball.
[7590.44s -> 7590.76s]  Yeah.
[7590.76s -> 7591.24s]  He likes it.
[7603.48s -> 7608.03s]  What about the boxing glove?
[7615.44s -> 7616.08s]  Almost 15.
[7621.44s -> 7622.16s]  Afternoon tea.
[7623.26s -> 7624.14s]  No, isn't like it.
[7625.82s -> 7626.06s]  All right.
[7626.06s -> 7626.78s]  What about sushi?
[7626.78s -> 7628.30s]  No, what about high tech shoes?
[7636.91s -> 7637.55s]  Anything else?
[7638.11s -> 7644.03s]  I really want to get him to 15.
[7645.45s -> 7645.85s]  Football.
[7651.80s -> 7652.52s]  Golden egg.
[7653.24s -> 7657.37s]  He doesn't like sushi.
[7657.37s -> 7658.25s]  Ashley likes sushi.
[7659.79s -> 7660.27s]  Baseball.
[7660.91s -> 7665.88s]  Give him a vase.
[7666.44s -> 7667.60s]  I'll try the vase.
[7673.85s -> 7674.94s]  That was incorrect.
[7677.23s -> 7677.95s]  Worth a shot though.
[7677.95s -> 7678.19s]  All right.
[7678.19s -> 7679.31s]  What about the electric guitar?
[7680.03s -> 7683.29s]  That's all right.
[7683.29s -> 7684.09s]  We got our 2000.
[7692.94s -> 7693.18s]  All right.
[7693.18s -> 7694.14s]  What about Jimmy?

[7718.00s -> 7726.36s]  Well, there we go.
[7730.19s -> 7731.79s]  That was actually his favorite thing.
[7735.56s -> 7735.80s]  All right.
[7735.80s -> 7736.92s]  Now, what about some of these others?
[7737.48s -> 7737.96s]  We've got...
[7738.92s -> 7740.28s]  Orbulon is level seven.
[7740.28s -> 7740.84s]  Do I have anything?
[7740.84s -> 7742.52s]  I got some of their bowling pins, right?
[7743.16s -> 7749.74s]  Jimmy just clogged out of his mind.
[7749.74s -> 7749.98s]  Yep.
[7750.62s -> 7754.83s]  You like these?
[7754.83s -> 7755.07s]  No.
[7755.63s -> 7757.50s]  You like these.
[7765.31s -> 7767.23s]  How can I get you to 15?
[7767.87s -> 7773.21s]  Toilet.
[7773.21s -> 7775.04s]  I have two toilets.
[7775.04s -> 7775.36s]  Let's see.
[7781.39s -> 7782.67s]  I think I'm thinking the vase.
[7783.23s -> 7785.53s]  I'm going.
[7785.53s -> 7786.33s]  I'm going vase.
[7789.10s -> 7789.98s]  No, it's not worth it.
[7789.98s -> 7790.46s]  It's not worth it.
[7791.26s -> 7791.58s]  Camera.
[7792.22s -> 7799.36s]  Iggy bank.
[7799.36s -> 7800.08s]  No, that's Wario.
[7802.41s -> 7802.89s]  Golden egg.
[7803.53s -> 7806.60s]  Got it.
[7806.60s -> 7810.88s]  Oh, we're going to have even more money to spend.
[7810.88s -> 7811.92s]  I can't wait.
[7811.92s -> 7817.55s]  Okay.
[7817.55s -> 7818.43s]  15.
[7818.43s -> 7819.63s]  What about these guys?
[7819.63s -> 7820.51s]  Oh, Mona.
[7820.51s -> 7821.15s]  All right.
[7821.15s -> 7821.87s]  What about Mona?
[7823.87s -> 7824.67s]  Cabin crews.
[7836.73s -> 7837.37s]  Wedding dress.
[7839.28s -> 7839.76s]  Oh, yeah.
[7840.40s -> 7845.48s]  Do that again.
[7846.04s -> 7852.14s]  And the manhole cover.
[7852.14s -> 7852.54s]  That's right.
[7852.54s -> 7853.50s]  I'm not even going to need to use it.
[7854.22s -> 7860.52s]  Who else is close?
[7861.08s -> 7861.32s]  All right.
[7861.32s -> 7862.04s]  You're 15.
[7863.00s -> 7864.52s]  Anybody else have more than level one?
[7871.23s -> 7871.55s]  No.
[7871.55s -> 7872.03s]  All right.
[7872.03s -> 7872.67s]  Let's go with...
[7873.63s -> 7875.56s]  A penny.
[7876.28s -> 7879.12s]  What should I do?
[7883.92s -> 7884.16s]  Red.
[7885.36s -> 7885.92s]  Do you like...
[7886.88s -> 7887.36s]  Bases?
[7888.16s -> 7901.20s]  Do you like helicopters?
[7901.76s -> 7907.28s]  Maybe because helicopters fly?
[7908.32s -> 7911.56s]  All right.
[7911.56s -> 7912.36s]  Level nine.
[7912.36s -> 7913.24s]  And why don't you take the crane?
[7913.96s -> 7916.11s]  Why do you like construction material?
[7916.11s -> 7916.43s]  All right.
[7917.07s -> 7922.24s]  He likes vehicles.
[7922.88s -> 7925.29s]  Fine.
[7925.93s -> 7927.40s]  You just got him to a little 15.
[7928.04s -> 7930.68s]  Give me red meat.
[7934.86s -> 7936.54s]  And apple core.
[7938.83s -> 7939.87s]  He likes the apple core.
[7940.43s -> 7942.96s]  All right.
[7942.96s -> 7943.36s]  15.
[7943.92s -> 7949.76s]  Who else?
[7953.47s -> 7953.71s]  Penny?
[7956.73s -> 7957.69s]  Penny, do you like a toilet?
[7958.99s -> 7959.23s]  Yeah.
[7968.17s -> 7968.65s]  I just got to...
[7968.65s -> 7970.25s]  I'm going to feed Penny literally everything.
[7970.89s -> 7971.77s]  Even if she doesn't like it.
[7974.08s -> 7974.40s]  Because...
[7975.60s -> 7977.36s]  I need to get somebody else 15 so I give them money.
[7985.24s -> 7985.72s]  Come on.
[7985.72s -> 7986.92s]  You're going to like one of these, right?
[7987.56s -> 7988.04s]  Come on.
[7988.84s -> 7992.30s]  I'm going to sleep for seven hours.
[7992.30s -> 7992.62s]  Holy shit.
[7992.62s -> 7993.82s]  This is abnormal.
[7995.82s -> 7996.78s]  Likes tea?
[7996.78s -> 7997.50s]  I'm not going to make it.
[7999.96s -> 8000.52s]  Come on.
[8000.52s -> 8001.72s]  I'm not going to make it.
[8001.72s -> 8002.60s]  Level 13.
[8006.89s -> 8007.45s]  Come on.
[8010.73s -> 8011.29s]  Come on.
[8011.29s -> 8011.93s]  One more level.
[8012.97s -> 8013.88s]  I'll get it.
[8022.33s -> 8022.89s]  Got it.
[8022.89s -> 8023.37s]  15.
[8026.62s -> 8027.50s]  How interesting.
[8028.30s -> 8028.70s]  Ha ha.
[8031.72s -> 8033.00s]  I'm just winding down, man.
[8033.88s -> 8036.60s]  I'm just like blinking like a hundred times when I say a sentence.
[8037.24s -> 8039.13s]  All right.
[8039.13s -> 8039.53s]  Let's go.
[8041.53s -> 8042.01s]  Where am I going?
[8042.01s -> 8042.25s]  Okay.
[8042.25s -> 8042.49s]  Here.
[8047.64s -> 8047.96s]  Money.
[8048.76s -> 8066.27s]  Give us more legendaries.
[8066.99s -> 8072.49s]  I want like...
[8072.49s -> 8074.41s]  Give me like four legendaries right now.
[8074.41s -> 8078.48s]  All right.
[8078.48s -> 8079.44s]  That's the last time I can do that.
[8084.43s -> 8084.91s]  I'm hungry.
[8084.91s -> 8085.39s]  Let's go eat.
[8093.23s -> 8094.51s]  Family guy whale.
[8106.20s -> 8106.68s]  Nice.
[8106.68s -> 8107.32s]  Come on.
[8107.32s -> 8108.12s]  Legendary.
[8108.12s -> 8115.98s]  All right.
[8115.98s -> 8116.46s]  Last chance.
[8116.46s -> 8125.96s]  It's all right.
[8125.96s -> 8128.78s]  It's all right.
[8128.78s -> 8132.54s]  I can't afford any of this.
[8133.42s -> 8136.43s]  Oh, there is actually one more thing I want to do.
[8137.15s -> 8139.85s]  All right.
[8139.85s -> 8140.57s]  So what do we got now?
[8141.29s -> 8144.01s]  We have Ashley likes one of these, right?
[8144.73s -> 8153.23s]  Yeah, the meat and the sushi.
[8153.87s -> 8155.55s]  Yeah.
[8155.55s -> 8156.51s]  I'm going to check out all the new art.
[8157.15s -> 8158.60s]  Curry sounds amazing right now.
[8158.60s -> 8158.92s]  Thank you.
[8159.72s -> 8163.13s]  I don't know.
[8163.77s -> 8164.25s]  Maybe not.
[8169.02s -> 8169.58s]  Orbulon.
[8170.30s -> 8175.90s]  Five volt.
[8179.15s -> 8179.71s]  Nine volt.
[8179.71s -> 8180.27s]  I can get up.
[8181.56s -> 8182.60s]  Nine volt loves this shit.
[8190.56s -> 8192.08s]  Give 18 volt the laptop.
[8193.71s -> 8203.80s]  Oh, yeah.
[8203.80s -> 8204.68s]  Do you like anything else?
[8204.68s -> 8212.28s]  No, he likes it.
[8212.28s -> 8216.99s]  Did you get gold in the Wario Cup?
[8216.99s -> 8218.03s]  Um, I didn't even...
[8218.03s -> 8219.07s]  I don't think I even really played it.
[8219.87s -> 8230.57s]  What's the point of raising the levels?
[8230.57s -> 8234.25s]  Um, to unlock new costumes for them and art.
[8234.25s -> 8235.21s]  Man, it's just kind of fun.
[8253.72s -> 8255.96s]  Gives you points in the Wario Cup mode.
[8255.96s -> 8259.63s]  Oh, that's kind of cool.
[8263.50s -> 8264.22s]  Change mic.
[8264.22s -> 8264.62s]  I'm going to...
[8264.62s -> 8265.10s]  Don't worry.
[8265.10s -> 8266.62s]  I'll give everybody their final costumes.
[8270.06s -> 8276.17s]  I'm just going to get rid of these.
[8276.17s -> 8296.96s]  Oh, that's too bad.
[8297.52s -> 8297.76s]  All right.
[8297.76s -> 8298.08s]  Let's see.
[8298.08s -> 8299.60s]  So we got Wario.
[8299.60s -> 8303.74s]  Look at Wario's gallery.
[8303.74s -> 8304.06s]  Cool.
[8304.62s -> 8307.64s]  Really creepy and weird.
[8308.28s -> 8310.03s]  Very cool.
[8310.83s -> 8312.38s]  Very cool.
[8313.02s -> 8317.45s]  Oh, look at all this.
[8317.45s -> 8318.73s]  They got all the different colors.
[8319.61s -> 8321.66s]  Phantom blue thanks to the five community subs.
[8322.22s -> 8323.26s]  Appreciate the community subs.
[8323.98s -> 8335.90s]  Kind of like, uh, shadowy Wario.
[8335.90s -> 8339.85s]  All right.
[8339.85s -> 8340.17s]  Cricket.
[8340.89s -> 8347.61s]  Cool.
[8347.61s -> 8347.93s]  Cool.
[8350.62s -> 8350.94s]  Cool.
[8352.35s -> 8352.67s]  Cool.
[8353.31s -> 8357.55s]  Okay, now should I...
[8357.55s -> 8357.87s]  What do you...
[8357.87s -> 8359.95s]  Should I get you special or what?
[8359.95s -> 8362.08s]  I kind of like that.
[8362.72s -> 8370.17s]  No, no special.
[8370.17s -> 8370.41s]  All right.
[8370.41s -> 8371.13s]  Let's do main.
[8372.86s -> 8373.42s]  Color hair.
[8373.98s -> 8390.86s]  Green with a orange shirt and yellow pants.
[8390.86s -> 8391.18s]  Sure.
[8391.74s -> 8395.48s]  All right.
[8395.48s -> 8396.20s]  Mona, what about you?
[8397.00s -> 8400.35s]  Very cool.
[8405.37s -> 8406.01s]  Cool.
[8406.01s -> 8406.65s]  Cool.
[8406.65s -> 8407.37s]  Cool.
[8407.37s -> 8407.93s]  Cool.
[8407.93s -> 8408.33s]  Cool.
[8409.21s -> 8410.36s]  Come on, man.
[8410.36s -> 8411.24s]  I'm just winding down.
[8411.24s -> 8412.84s]  I expelled all my...
[8412.84s -> 8414.20s]  I expelled all my energy.
[8414.84s -> 8417.32s]  I'm screaming at the super hard mode.
[8419.31s -> 8420.35s]  All my energy is gone.
[8420.83s -> 8422.83s]  I beat no more heroes two hours ago.
[8423.72s -> 8424.20s]  Cool.
[8424.20s -> 8424.44s]  Cool.
[8424.44s -> 8425.80s]  It is cool, but I'm just tired.
[8425.80s -> 8426.60s]  I'm relaxing.
[8426.60s -> 8427.00s]  Relax.
[8427.56s -> 8431.02s]  I like how this went from a nuclear meltdown to this.
[8431.02s -> 8431.82s]  There wasn't even...
[8431.82s -> 8433.66s]  That was not a nuclear meltdown.
[8436.89s -> 8437.53s]  It was not.
[8438.68s -> 8440.20s]  A nuclear meltdown.
[8440.20s -> 8441.96s]  That is not even close.
[8443.98s -> 8445.74s]  It was not even close to a nuclear meltdown.
[8445.74s -> 8446.30s]  Give me a break.
[8447.10s -> 8450.11s]  We did not go full nuclear.
[8450.11s -> 8450.59s]  No, we did not.
[8450.59s -> 8451.23s]  Oh, I like that.
[8462.09s -> 8464.08s]  Well, you're screaming at the game.
[8464.08s -> 8465.12s]  I wasn't screaming at the game.
[8465.76s -> 8467.74s]  When did I scream at the game?
[8470.46s -> 8476.36s]  Streamer dies playing WarioWare on a 10-day sub-a-thon challenge.
[8476.36s -> 8479.60s]  I need to listen to this.
[8480.16s -> 8497.69s]  Let's watch this.
[8498.25s -> 8514.30s]  Okay.
[8531.82s -> 8533.18s]  Get over there, you fucking...
[8549.56s -> 8556.56s]  How long is this clip?
[8558.96s -> 8559.52s]  It dies.
[8560.80s -> 8563.12s]  10-day sub-a-thon challenge.
[8568.84s -> 8571.00s]  Why couldn't I fucking break it?
[8571.96s -> 8577.61s]  Get over there, you fucking...
[8579.98s -> 8581.50s]  There is like a delay.
[8581.50s -> 8582.54s]  It's like a tenth of a second.
[8582.54s -> 8583.58s]  Get over there, you fucking...
[8584.38s -> 8586.51s]  It's because of the webcam lag.
[8586.51s -> 8586.91s]  Okay.
[8586.91s -> 8587.55s]  Well, whatever.
[8587.55s -> 8588.99s]  You got any more clips I can watch?
[8588.99s -> 8589.31s]  Sure.
[8591.66s -> 8592.46s]  Watch this one.
[8592.46s -> 8592.78s]  Okay.
[8599.05s -> 8600.73s]  I don't think this was a nuclear meltdown.
[8600.73s -> 8601.45s]  I really don't think so.
[8602.09s -> 8603.29s]  I think you guys got it wrong.
[8612.33s -> 8613.85s]  I don't consider this to be nuclear.
[8614.49s -> 8616.57s]  This was like...
[8616.57s -> 8617.93s]  This was slight irritation.
[8626.99s -> 8630.38s]  That character...
[8630.38s -> 8631.18s]  What?
[8631.18s -> 8631.82s]  That character...
[8631.82s -> 8632.70s]  That character is like...
[8632.70s -> 8634.65s]  I was like...
[8634.65s -> 8638.17s]  Some of this is clearly having a small amount of issue
[8638.17s -> 8641.77s]  with the fact that the video game was fucking poorly.
[8642.41s -> 8644.65s]  I didn't expect what was going to happen in front of me.
[8644.65s -> 8646.89s]  That's a very normal reaction to have
[8646.89s -> 8649.61s]  when there's something incredibly that you don't think is going to happen happens.
[8650.33s -> 8651.37s]  Three-year-old.
[8651.37s -> 8652.49s]  That's not a three-year-old.
[8663.12s -> 8663.68s]  I got...
[8663.68s -> 8666.32s]  I'm getting stuck because I was at level...
[8666.32s -> 8668.24s]  I was at literally episode 49,
[8668.80s -> 8669.76s]  trying to get to 50.
[8670.72s -> 8671.68s]  I couldn't do it.
[8671.68s -> 8673.92s]  That's a horrible, horrible scenario.
[8676.44s -> 8677.24s]  Here's another one.
[8677.88s -> 8678.28s]  All right.
[8678.28s -> 8681.08s]  I'm going to only watch like two more of these before I get the point.
[8681.08s -> 8682.12s]  I don't think it was nuclear.
[8682.12s -> 8682.84s]  I don't think it was.
[8682.84s -> 8683.32s]  It was like...
[8684.04s -> 8684.76s]  It was sizzling.
[8684.76s -> 8685.40s]  It was simmering.
[8686.04s -> 8689.10s]  It was simmering a little.
[8689.90s -> 8696.40s]  This shit was not nuclear.
[8696.40s -> 8696.56s]  All right.
[8696.56s -> 8697.12s]  What's this one?
[8711.87s -> 8713.47s]  That was fucking stupid.
[8715.15s -> 8715.79s]  Don't you get that?
[8715.79s -> 8716.75s]  What are you, motherfucker?
[8716.75s -> 8717.87s]  What are you doing?
[8717.87s -> 8718.35s]  What?
[8718.35s -> 8718.67s]  What?
[8718.67s -> 8719.39s]  What the hell?
[8720.88s -> 8721.44s]  Okay.
[8721.44s -> 8722.00s]  Okay.
[8722.00s -> 8723.04s]  What the fuck?
[8725.63s -> 8730.17s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[8730.17s -> 8731.37s]  But watch what happens here.
[8733.85s -> 8734.65s]  She doesn't grab it.
[8735.53s -> 8736.49s]  She didn't grab it.
[8736.49s -> 8737.37s]  And she's supposed to be...
[8737.37s -> 8739.37s]  When you touch it, you put it goes on your character.
[8739.37s -> 8744.14s]  What the fuck are you, motherfucker?
[8744.14s -> 8745.26s]  What are you doing?
[8745.26s -> 8745.66s]  What?
[8745.66s -> 8746.06s]  What?
[8746.06s -> 8746.78s]  What the hell?
[8748.24s -> 8748.80s]  Okay.
[8748.80s -> 8749.36s]  Okay.
[8749.36s -> 8753.05s]  What the fuck?
[8753.05s -> 8754.81s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[8755.53s -> 8759.66s]  The air blow.
[8759.66s -> 8760.06s]  All right.
[8760.06s -> 8760.78s]  Last one.
[8760.78s -> 8761.58s]  I'm not watching.
[8761.58s -> 8761.98s]  You'll see.
[8761.98s -> 8763.02s]  Watch the second channel.
[8764.30s -> 8765.66s]  You'll see this video soon.
[8771.32s -> 8772.84s]  Oh, fucking nuclear.
[8774.99s -> 8781.04s]  I don't know what this one is, but I'm gonna watch it.
[8781.04s -> 8783.60s]  This one's called the air blow psycho.
[8803.74s -> 8805.02s]  That one's kinda fucked up.
[8805.02s -> 8808.76s]  It's kinda fucked up.
[8808.76s -> 8809.00s]  Okay.
[8809.00s -> 8813.90s]  That one was like a fireball was just going towards me.
[8813.90s -> 8820.67s]  And that's the last thing I thought to do before I got liquefied.
[8820.67s -> 8821.63s]  Oh my goodness.
[8825.52s -> 8826.88s]  Holy shit, dude.
[8834.54s -> 8836.54s]  I'm at Thanksgiving dinner.
[8836.54s -> 8843.04s]  And we're sitting there as the family.
[8843.04s -> 8846.24s]  And the sun's not there or something.
[8846.24s -> 8850.00s]  It's like, oh, everyone's at the table except for like Sean.
[8850.56s -> 8853.28s]  And I'm mom.
[8853.28s -> 8855.32s]  And I spent all day doing this.
[8855.32s -> 8858.30s]  Setting up this table and everything.
[8858.30s -> 8860.54s]  And then finally, like we're in the middle of a conversation.
[8861.26s -> 8864.62s]  And like Sean comes down and fucking just in his underwear.
[8864.62s -> 8867.93s]  He goes into the fridge and starts drinking milk out of the carton.
[8867.93s -> 8871.56s]  And I just took a bite at a turkey.
[8871.56s -> 8874.84s]  That's the face that's like the holy shit, Sean.
[8874.84s -> 8876.84s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[8876.84s -> 8878.91s]  Why are you not down here?
[8878.91s -> 8880.03s]  Surrounded by family.
[8880.03s -> 8882.43s]  Uncles, aunts, cousins, relatives.
[8885.87s -> 8887.71s]  And now it's embarrassing for me now because I have to talk.
[8887.71s -> 8898.44s]  What am I going to do about this?
[8898.44s -> 8899.48s]  All right, I'm out of here.
[8899.48s -> 8900.12s]  I'm done.
[8900.12s -> 8901.80s]  Wait, let's look at the rest of these.
[8901.80s -> 8905.02s]  That wasn't even nuclear.
[8905.02s -> 8908.68s]  It was a little spicy, I will tell you.
[8908.68s -> 8915.16s]  Hold on.
[8915.16s -> 8915.64s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[8915.64s -> 8916.28s]  This is one more.
[8916.28s -> 8917.32s]  Fighting cat dog.
[8920.97s -> 8922.17s]  Fighting cat dog?
[8922.17s -> 8923.53s]  Like Nickelodeon cat dog?
[8924.33s -> 8929.90s]  I don't get it.
[8929.90s -> 8931.82s]  Did I make a Nickelodeon reference?
[8931.82s -> 8935.12s]  What's the Nickelodeon reference?
[8940.91s -> 8943.23s]  That one needs to be patched.
[8943.23s -> 8945.39s]  That one needs to be patched.
[8945.47s -> 8947.31s]  That one needs to be patched.
[8947.31s -> 8949.07s]  That one needs to be patched.
[8950.11s -> 8952.67s]  That one needs to be patched.
[8952.67s -> 8954.91s]  Are you talking about the rabbit from cat dog?
[8955.95s -> 8956.67s]  Cat dog?
[8957.39s -> 8959.15s]  You guys are in lots of trouble.
[8959.15s -> 8962.59s]  You think that you can come into my restaurant, cat dog?
[8962.59s -> 8963.55s]  Oh, fuck it is.
[8963.55s -> 8964.19s]  It's the rabbit.
[8964.19s -> 8965.07s]  It's like the bad guy.
[8968.76s -> 8971.08s]  That one needs to be patched.
[8971.08s -> 8973.32s]  That one needs to be patched.
[8973.32s -> 8975.16s]  That one needs to be patched.
[8975.16s -> 8976.92s]  That one needs to be patched.
[8977.96s -> 8979.40s]  That one needs to be...
[8982.46s -> 8983.90s]  It's the cat dog rabbit.
[8991.00s -> 8991.80s]  How would you even...
[8991.80s -> 8992.60s]  Oh my god.
[8997.08s -> 8998.28s]  We consider and watch these.
[8999.64s -> 9000.84s]  Maybe it was a little nuclear.
[9001.56s -> 9002.36s]  I don't think nuclear...
[9002.36s -> 9002.60s]  Look.
[9004.01s -> 9004.81s]  All right.
[9004.81s -> 9005.21s]  Well, look.
[9010.03s -> 9012.35s]  I think I've gone all year without a nuclear stream.
[9012.35s -> 9012.99s]  So whatever.
[9012.99s -> 9013.63s]  I don't even care.
[9015.39s -> 9016.03s]  I don't even care.
[9016.75s -> 9017.79s]  I don't even care.
[9018.67s -> 9019.87s]  I don't even care, you know?
[9019.87s -> 9020.35s]  I don't care.
[9022.59s -> 9022.91s]  All right.
[9022.91s -> 9023.31s]  Last one.
[9023.31s -> 9023.55s]  What is this?
[9023.55s -> 9024.91s]  I'm stuck on shit.
[9024.91s -> 9027.15s]  Great 2D character game in a Wario game.
[9027.15s -> 9038.57s]  It's fucking caught.
[9039.93s -> 9041.93s]  Some of these are just impossible.
[9041.93s -> 9043.13s]  And I guess you have to live with that.
[9044.17s -> 9045.28s]  What's wrong with that?
[9045.28s -> 9046.16s]  I'm stuck on shit.
[9046.16s -> 9051.80s]  Great 2D character game in a Wario game.
[9051.80s -> 9052.52s]  It's not...
[9052.52s -> 9052.84s]  All right.
[9058.91s -> 9060.35s]  I've won Batman.
[9060.35s -> 9060.67s]  All right.
[9060.67s -> 9062.27s]  This is actually the last one.
[9062.27s -> 9062.59s]  I'm...
[9062.59s -> 9062.83s]  Look.
[9062.83s -> 9062.99s]  Yeah.
[9062.99s -> 9063.79s]  I was pissed off.
[9064.91s -> 9067.15s]  I'm playing super hard nuclear mode.
[9067.15s -> 9067.63s]  All right.
[9067.63s -> 9071.55s]  If I'm going to play nuclear mode and try to get past 50 rounds on nuclear,
[9071.55s -> 9072.99s]  it's going to be a nuclear stream.
[9072.99s -> 9074.03s]  Don't you get it?
[9074.03s -> 9080.96s]  This is the last one.
[9081.52s -> 9084.40s]  And then we're going to go through the last of the artwork here.
[9085.04s -> 9088.12s]  And we're going to go from there.
[9088.12s -> 9092.59s]  What was this called?
[9092.59s -> 9093.71s]  You've won Batman?
[9093.71s -> 9094.83s]  Or I've won Batman?
[9094.83s -> 9095.47s]  I don't know.
[9095.47s -> 9096.11s]  One of those two.
[9099.88s -> 9113.47s]  Just a laugh.
[9113.47s -> 9115.79s]  Where's the one where I call it a flop?
[9115.79s -> 9116.59s]  I'm going to see that one.
[9117.47s -> 9117.95s]  All right.
[9117.95s -> 9119.95s]  Somebody link me the one where I call the game a flop.
[9119.95s -> 9121.07s]  That's the one I really want to see.
[9130.88s -> 9131.76s]  Jerry Seinfeld.
[9131.76s -> 9132.48s]  It's not that one.
[9134.75s -> 9135.55s]  He hates it.
[9136.11s -> 9137.64s]  That's probably it.
[9143.96s -> 9147.56s]  I am going to judge if this is a nuclear stream or not by this...
[9147.56s -> 9149.16s]  My interaction here.
[9149.80s -> 9155.20s]  Because I can tell that I was actually a little actually irritated during this part.
[9157.15s -> 9157.95s]  It's not that one.
[9158.67s -> 9163.12s]  Okay.
[9163.12s -> 9163.68s]  Let's find out.
[9164.32s -> 9173.42s]  You like this game?
[9173.42s -> 9173.58s]  No.
[9174.22s -> 9175.26s]  No, I hate it, actually.
[9175.26s -> 9176.14s]  I think this is the worst one.
[9177.76s -> 9179.84s]  This is the worst game I've played in the last 10 years.
[9180.40s -> 9180.80s]  At least.
[9183.26s -> 9183.58s]  What a...
[9183.58s -> 9184.14s]  What a...
[9184.14s -> 9185.34s]  What a fucking flop.
[9186.06s -> 9187.42s]  All right.
[9187.42s -> 9189.02s]  I concede it was nuclear.
[9189.02s -> 9190.96s]  I concede.
[9191.52s -> 9192.64s]  I concede.
[9192.64s -> 9193.68s]  Let's get back to this.
[9193.68s -> 9194.64s]  Okay.
[9194.64s -> 9196.06s]  Oh!
[9196.06s -> 9196.70s]  Look at this artwork.
[9196.70s -> 9197.10s]  Dr...
[9197.10s -> 9197.82s]  Dr.
[9197.82s -> 9198.38s]  Chrygor.
[9198.38s -> 9199.18s]  Now, hold on.
[9199.18s -> 9199.96s]  You can't hear anything.
[9200.20s -> 9200.44s]  There we go.
[9201.08s -> 9201.72s]  All right.
[9201.72s -> 9202.52s]  We have...
[9202.52s -> 9207.08s]  Who do we have to-
[9207.08s -> 9207.40s]  He's coming to us.
[9207.40s -> 9209.56s]  We have a new wave of people who didn't kill themselvesake.
[9209.56s -> 9212.56s]  He just succeeded at his정을.
[9212.56s -> 9213.28s]  Why?
[9213.28s -> 9215.87s]  Alright.
[9216.33s -> 9219.02s]  Let's watch.

[9297.77s -> 9305.64s]  um I mean the anger was not opening galleries and looking at the artwork it was to get past

[9855.27s -> 9861.96s]  out so it doesn't really qualify as a meltdown stream only the last hour or two was a true
[9861.96s -> 9870.48s]  meltdown anyways I'll see you guys next weekend take care of yourselves thanks for watching as
[9870.48s -> 9875.36s]  always good night goodbye and take care
