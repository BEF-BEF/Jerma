[0.76s -> 14.17s]  Hi guys. How are you? Where's my stuff? What happened to my stuff?
[14.17s -> 18.09s]  Hold on, why is this over here? I haven't been here in like
[18.09s -> 23.13s]  like 38 hours, not like six weeks. Why is all my shit moved around?
[23.13s -> 52.31s]  Hold on. Yeah, that's a little better. Why the fuck is everyone moved around?
[52.31s -> 59.16s]  I didn't do that. Somebody like snuck in my room and did it.
[59.16s -> 63.29s]  All right, so hello there. Tonight we're gonna play
[63.37s -> 72.82s]  Mount and Blade Warband. I have an incredibly highly requested game
[72.82s -> 80.22s]  that... it took me like a year to get it on the screen.
[80.22s -> 84.38s]  It was a very, very tough battle between Mount and Blade and
[84.38s -> 92.38s]  I Spy Children's... Haunted Mansion kids children's game
[92.38s -> 104.18s]  thing and Desert Buzz. Let me get a sip of that coffee
[104.18s -> 108.46s]  and I'll be live at about two... I am live. I'll be here in about 15 seconds.
[108.46s -> 143.78s]  Hold on. Okay, sorry. I have two pieces of music playing in my ear at the same
[143.78s -> 149.58s]  time and it's jamming me. I have the Mount and Blade Star Wars
[149.58s -> 152.76s]  music going on and then also this. This is what I'm
[152.76s -> 162.18s]  playing. Ready? All right, let me get that over here. All
[162.18s -> 168.52s]  right, let's go. Mount and Blade Warband. I have no idea how
[168.52s -> 173.16s]  this game plays. I was told it was kind of like Kenshi. You wander the
[173.16s -> 184.73s]  wasteland or something like that and now you
[184.73s -> 189.72s]  should be able to see it. It's kind of like Kenshi but with a
[189.72s -> 200.07s]  thousand people. Oh god. Okay, well this is gonna be interesting.
[200.07s -> 203.86s]  All right, should I... I gotta play the tutorial, right? I have no idea what's
[203.86s -> 209.96s]  going on. You approach a field where the locals are
[209.96s -> 214.14s]  training with weapons you can practice here to improve your combat skills.
[214.14s -> 219.40s]  Continue... that's... Okay, we're just here. Walk around the training field and speak
[219.40s -> 222.04s]  with the fighters to practice various actors of Mount and Blade combat.
[222.04s -> 226.60s]  You can use Asdy... Come on, that's Wasdy, not Asdy.
[226.60s -> 229.32s]  Move around to talk to a character, approach him until his name appears on
[229.32s -> 232.92s]  your screen, then press the F key. You can also use the F key to pick up
[232.92s -> 237.05s]  items. Open doors interact with objects. Press
[237.05s -> 239.05s]  tab to exit the tutorial at any time. Okay, so
[239.05s -> 244.94s]  walk and then... Is there a sprint? There's a practice on this guy's head.
[244.94s -> 249.83s]  A novice fighter. Hello there, we're polishing off our combat skills with a bit
[249.83s -> 252.55s]  of sparring practice. You look like you could use a bit of training.
[252.55s -> 255.75s]  Why don't you join us and we can show you a few tricks.
[255.75s -> 258.79s]  And if you need an explanation of any combat concepts, just ask and I will do
[258.79s -> 266.87s]  my best to fill you in. Let's attack. Okay, I'm not going to read
[266.87s -> 271.72s]  any of the stuff up there. No, no, no. I... Why would I do that?
[271.72s -> 276.94s]  I need to, like, know what to do. Why would I not read it?
[276.94s -> 281.18s]  All right, there are four principal directions for attacking.
[281.18s -> 284.06s]  These are overhead swing, right swing, left swing,
[284.06s -> 288.94s]  chew chew chew, hey hey hey. Now I'll tell you which direction to attack from and
[288.94s -> 294.14s]  you must try to do the correct attack. Move your mouse while you press the left
[294.14s -> 300.62s]  mouse button to specify attack direction. Okay, so it's mouse movement and click.
[300.62s -> 303.58s]  Now for example, to execute an overhead attack, move the mouse up
[303.58s -> 307.43s]  at the instant you press the left mouse button. The icons on your screen will
[307.43s -> 313.93s]  help you do the correct action. Okay, so he wants me to do what? Swing to
[313.93s -> 327.72s]  left. Okay, how many more? Down? Can you move around and do that?
[327.72s -> 334.98s]  I guess you can. Very good. You've learned how to attack from
[334.98s -> 337.54s]  any direction you want. If you like, we can try this again and move to a
[337.54s -> 343.99s]  different exercise. I would like to practice blocking.
[343.99s -> 347.59s]  Unlike a shield, blocking with a weapon can only stop attacks from coming from
[347.59s -> 350.63s]  one direction. For example, if you block up, you'll
[350.63s -> 354.23s]  deflect overhead attacks, but you can still be hit by side swings or thrust
[354.23s -> 361.11s]  attacks. Bullshit. All right, you must press and
[361.11s -> 364.15s]  hold down the right mouse button to block.
[364.15s -> 368.62s]  Okay, I'll now attack you with different types of strokes
[368.62s -> 371.66s]  and I will wait until you do the correct block before attacking. Try to do the
[371.66s -> 376.10s]  correct block as soon as you can. This practice is easy to do with the
[376.10s -> 380.02s]  automatic block direction setting, which is the default.
[380.02s -> 383.14s]  All right, well I'm not turning that off. If you go to the options menu and change
[383.22s -> 385.78s]  defend direction, control the mouse movement or keyboard, you'll need to
[385.78s -> 389.06s]  manually choose block direction. This is much more challenging, but makes
[389.06s -> 393.22s]  the game much more interesting. This practice can be useful if you use
[393.22s -> 399.03s]  manual blocking. I don't care. No, I ain't gonna, I ain't
[399.03s -> 407.80s]  ready for that. So I just gotta parry until you hold?
[407.80s -> 411.50s]  Hold. Yeah, I'm not doing the direct, I can do the direction shoot with the other
[411.50s -> 418.09s]  thing. Swinging. Not with blocking.
[418.09s -> 432.17s]  Does this game suck? I'm curious. No, okay. Good, you're able to block my attack
[432.17s -> 436.01s]  successfully. You may repeat this practice and try to get faster each time
[436.01s -> 440.95s]  until you're confident in your defense skills. Do you want to have another go?
[440.95s -> 449.16s]  No, I think I got it. Detective stream part two.
[449.16s -> 454.58s]  Well, I guess I'm like, okay, let's take a look at this here. I was just
[454.58s -> 459.83s]  fucking blue and you know what? I gotta do it.
[459.83s -> 466.28s]  I have to do it. I have to tell you guys something. I have to tell you a stream
[466.28s -> 470.78s]  that's coming up. I have to because I need help with that stream and there's
[470.78s -> 475.40s]  only one way I'm going to be able to do that
[475.40s -> 478.68s]  and that's with throwing a line out to the community.
[478.68s -> 490.84s]  I have to do it. So I need, you know what? I'm gonna do, we'll do this in the
[490.84s -> 493.62s]  discord. Later on in the discord either today or
[493.62s -> 501.11s]  tomorrow, I'm gonna throw a line out about something to do with robotics.
[501.11s -> 507.75s]  Okay? If you know about robotics, specifically twitch-controlled robotics,
[507.75s -> 516.17s]  I may need to ask you a few questions. So, uh,
[516.17s -> 519.61s]  I'm gonna throw the line out to the community because I've been trying to do
[519.61s -> 522.66s]  research. I've been trying to figure it out for months
[522.66s -> 536.74s]  and that's the way we're gonna go with it. Bionic boomer stream.
[536.74s -> 539.86s]  What? I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna give you the punch line because that's very
[539.86s -> 543.77s]  important, but it's not the bionic boomer stream.
[543.77s -> 549.02s]  That's completely different. This is something else, but like I need,
[549.02s -> 554.28s]  I need some community help on it, I think. I'll throw the line out in the
[554.28s -> 562.98s]  discord later. All right, let's go. Do I get to create
[562.98s -> 566.18s]  my character? Uh, what do you want to practice? I want
[566.18s -> 570.15s]  to practice attacking. Blocking. Let's do some spar. No.
[570.15s -> 574.87s]  Regular fighter. Okay, I, do I know everything?
[574.87s -> 583.86s]  Do I need to spar? Non-lethal weapons. All right, let's go.
[583.86s -> 595.00s]  I'm ready. Okay, killed that guy. We were supposed to do non-lethal attacks.
[595.00s -> 601.29s]  Okay, uh, next time be more careful. Well, I, okay, but did I hit him right in
[601.29s -> 606.74s]  the face? That was good, but next time be more
[606.74s -> 613.75s]  careful. Okay, I'll be more careful.
[614.41s -> 625.67s]  Why can't I block this? Okay, this guy obviously
[625.67s -> 633.53s]  is not gonna spar with me. Uh, I'd like to do something else. All right,
[633.53s -> 638.63s]  what's this? You get to block every time they change
[638.63s -> 643.02s]  the direction. Okay, riding trainer. Good day, I've come here for some riding
[643.02s -> 646.22s]  practice, but my old bones are aching badly, so I
[646.22s -> 648.54s]  decided to give myself a rest today. If you would like to practice your
[648.54s -> 652.38s]  horsemanship, you can take my horse here. The exercise
[652.38s -> 656.73s]  would be good for her. Yes, I'd love to practice riding.
[656.73s -> 660.81s]  Pre-recorded stream talking voice. Uh, good, now I'll give you a few exercises
[660.81s -> 664.22s]  that will teach you riding and horseback weapon use.
[664.22s -> 668.46s]  Just take your horse for a ride on the course. Go as slow or as fast as you like.
[668.46s -> 671.42s]  Come back when you feel confident as a rider, and I'll give you some tougher
[671.46s -> 677.24s]  exercises. Okay, mount a horse by f. That's practice
[677.24s -> 682.65s]  horse. Ride, how do you ride? Just w-a-s-d?
[682.65s -> 691.26s]  I'm sorry, a-s-w-e-d? Whatever, whatever they said. It's very loud.
[691.26s -> 703.08s]  Uh, I may need to turn this down a little. That's better. Right, so
[703.08s -> 706.84s]  don't attack anything, just just ride. Is there a faster way to go?
[706.84s -> 719.67s]  Do what, what kind of weapons do I get in this game? Stick?
[719.67s -> 726.15s]  Long stick? Short stick? This is like 1,645, right?
[726.23s -> 729.67s]  All they had is brums back then. They didn't have any real weapons.
[729.67s -> 745.06s]  They had molotovs? No, they didn't. You finished the exercise, now go back to the
[745.06s -> 752.52s]  trainer and talk to him. Okay, how do I get off? Oh, thanks.
[752.52s -> 758.79s]  How do I get off the horse? F, okay. Uh, move on to something more difficult.
[758.79s -> 761.59s]  Grab the lance you see over there and ride around the course hitting each
[761.59s -> 766.65s]  target at least once. Okay, grab the lance. Grab the long stick.
[766.65s -> 786.86s]  See? It's just huge brums. Strike the dummy. How? Just got it. Not really that
[786.86s -> 792.15s]  good of mounted combat apparently. Is there a certain like hitbox or
[792.15s -> 803.82s]  something or is it? Okay, there we go. It's a little weird.
[803.82s -> 811.98s]  It's kind of, I'm gonna run into people like this accidentally.
[811.98s -> 816.12s]  All right, that's not bad. This game's fucking sick.
[816.12s -> 827.32s]  I'm just kidding. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding guys, don't worry.
[827.32s -> 833.51s]  I'm in the damn tutorial. It is though. I know, I know, I'm just fucking around.
[833.91s -> 848.68s]  Delivered 29, so this really is like third person Kenshi, just the way that it
[848.68s -> 851.72s]  looks. It's by the same people, the same one
[851.72s -> 856.07s]  guy make this game. Your next challenge would be to using a
[856.07s -> 859.67s]  bone arrow to shoot at the archery targets by the road.
[859.67s -> 863.58s]  Put in each target to consider yourself successful. Okay.
[863.58s -> 870.18s]  Go near the practice bone, press F to pick it up. How do I get off the horse?
[870.18s -> 875.90s]  You didn't give me that information. How do I get off? How do I get off?
[877.99s -> 885.93s]  Oh, come on, in fucking Red Dead Redemption, you just have to press
[885.93s -> 903.42s]  triangle. Now do I need to, on horseback, so I gotta ride over there and do it?
[903.42s -> 907.34s]  So shoot it, how do I shoot it? Just hold it down? Okay.
[907.34s -> 921.05s]  Is there a way to stabilize? What's like the drop on this?
[921.05s -> 938.95s]  Press R, first person. Um, where's the, got it.
[938.95s -> 946.14s]  Uh, I don't want that view. I'd rather be on this view. It's gonna aim way higher
[946.14s -> 960.90s]  than that. Okay, this is weird. Can I?
[960.90s -> 974.46s]  Press, you hold shift to zoom in. So you gotta aim higher than that.
[974.46s -> 985.78s]  Control plus space? Why do you have dummies
[985.78s -> 994.26s]  in the same place there? I'd rather not go first person.
[994.26s -> 1005.10s]  That hit. What? That didn't hit? How did that not hit?
[1005.10s -> 1033.88s]  Okay, can I please, the first time. Horse archery is OP, chat is dumb, level
[1033.88s -> 1042.22s]  it up. Well, let me learn how to do it first.
[1042.22s -> 1046.14s]  One guy said that, but guess what? Cash in your one guy tokens!
[1046.14s -> 1052.06s]  I also made myself a lot louder. Am I like really fucking loud? I should be
[1052.06s -> 1060.97s]  really loud. I didn't, I didn't increase the volume in my voice.
[1060.97s -> 1066.73s]  All right, able-to-shoot-a-torque-to-the-horseback-I-keep-riding-practice-do-today-and-you-breed-expert-horse-man.
[1066.73s -> 1076.42s]  All right, now what the hell do I do? That guy's like dropped into take push-ups.
[1076.42s -> 1080.82s]  Uh, you're standing in a really awkward, weird place. No.
[1080.82s -> 1096.90s]  Um, did I do it all? Am I tutorial done? I don't see anything else to do. What about
[1096.90s -> 1107.58s]  this guy? Archery, okay, hold on. Well, I didn't even know how to do this.
[1107.58s -> 1110.70s]  I went to the horseback archery before I did the regular archery.
[1110.70s -> 1114.46s]  The bow is a difficult weapon to master, but once you are sufficiently good at it,
[1114.46s -> 1117.98s]  you can shoot quickly and with great power.
[1117.98s -> 1130.01s]  Shoot the targets. The size of the targeting recticule
[1130.01s -> 1133.45s]  indicates your accuracy. Press and hold down the left mouse button until the
[1133.45s -> 1136.81s]  recticule shrinks down to its minimum size. Release the left mouse button when
[1136.81s -> 1139.53s]  its recticule is at its smallest. If you want it to wait too long,
[1139.53s -> 1150.02s]  if you wait too long, the recticule will expand again. All right, okay, I get you.
[1150.02s -> 1160.86s]  Hey, whoa, easy. Put the fucking safety on.
[1160.86s -> 1165.10s]  Well, so let's take a look at how the drop is then.
[1165.10s -> 1171.45s]  That's not hitting it. Am I fucking missing something here?
[1171.45s -> 1180.86s]  No, this is going in. So that, okay, I am hitting it.
[1180.86s -> 1212.84s]  Do I have to hit this 72 times? Okay, what? Oh!
[1219.51s -> 1223.67s]  Well, all right. I'm sorry, but the guy standing here,
[1223.67s -> 1234.25s]  there are targets over here, people practicing.
[1234.25s -> 1254.78s]  I hit it. Do I have to hit the tip? Oh, that's not going where I want it to.
[1254.78s -> 1257.58s]  Not bad, not bad at all. You seem to have grasped the basics of archery. Now try to
[1257.58s -> 1261.77s]  do the same thing with a crossbow. Take the crossbow of the bolts over there
[1261.77s -> 1265.29s]  and shoot those three targets. The crossbow is much easier to shoot with
[1265.29s -> 1269.61s]  compared with the bow, but you need to reload it after each shot.
[1269.61s -> 1282.18s]  I think I'm gonna be a crossbow guy. Okay, let's zoom it in.
[1282.18s -> 1292.90s]  Ooh, how do you reload? Just like that. This thing's great. I mean, it does take
[1292.90s -> 1300.60s]  too long to reload, but... All right, good. You didn't have too much
[1300.60s -> 1303.64s]  difficulty using the crossbow either. Next, you'll learn to use throwing weapons.
[1303.64s -> 1307.32s]  Pick up the javelins you see over there and try to hit those three targets.
[1307.32s -> 1314.92s]  Let's pick up the fucking sausage. Let's get the big cigar.
[1314.92s -> 1318.20s]  Let's get the big cartoon bachelor party cigar.
[1318.20s -> 1345.05s]  Well, that's weird. Yeah, it takes a little adjusting. Yeah, it's all right.
[1345.05s -> 1348.01s]  Well, with that you have received the basic skills to use all three types of
[1348.01s -> 1351.29s]  ranged weapons. The rest will come with practice.
[1351.29s -> 1355.85s]  Train each and every day and in time you will be as good as the best
[1355.85s -> 1361.38s]  marksman in Calradia. Now go talk with the melee
[1361.38s -> 1364.34s]  fighters of the hoistmanship trainer. They can teach you important stuff. So I
[1364.34s -> 1370.71s]  did it all. It's done good, right? It's a direction
[1370.71s -> 1379.99s]  block, direction, archery. All right, so just hit tab.
[1379.99s -> 1387.26s]  Start a new game. Oh god, now I gotta do the fucking voice.
[1387.26s -> 1392.06s]  I gotta put on a fucking voice now. Welcome adventurer to Mountain Blade
[1392.06s -> 1394.78s]  Warband. Before beginning the game you must create
[1394.78s -> 1397.90s]  your character. No, this is not that important. Remember then in the
[1397.90s -> 1400.14s]  traditional medieval society depicted in the game,
[1400.14s -> 1404.06s]  war and politics are usually dominated by male members of the nobility.
[1404.06s -> 1406.62s]  That does not, however, mean that you should not choose to play a female
[1406.62s -> 1409.58s]  character or one who is not of noble birth.
[1409.58s -> 1413.34s]  Male nobles may have a somewhat easier start but women and commoners can
[1413.34s -> 1416.54s]  attain all the same goals and in fact may have much more interesting
[1416.54s -> 1425.16s]  if more challenging early game. Okay, uh sometimes I just, I want the game
[1425.16s -> 1429.48s]  just to be, it said it was gonna be like harder to be like,
[1429.48s -> 1441.18s]  you were born years ago in a land far away.
[1441.18s -> 1445.26s]  Easy, no, I'll just, everybody quiet down.
[1445.26s -> 1449.02s]  Everybody quiet down or I'm gonna put on the YouTuber voice.
[1449.02s -> 1454.79s]  Do you want that this whole stream? I'll do it.
[1454.79s -> 1458.55s]  You were born years ago in a land far away. Your father
[1458.55s -> 1475.94s]  was a noble because that's the easy one. A thief, a hunter, a veteran, warrior.
[1475.94s -> 1479.22s]  This is not me though, this is my father. I don't have to be like my father.
[1479.22s -> 1497.22s]  A hunter. Um, I don't know. You came into this world a son of a declining nobility
[1497.22s -> 1501.78s]  owning only the house in which they lived. However, despite your family's
[1501.78s -> 1505.62s]  hardships they afforded you a good education and trained you from childhood
[1505.62s -> 1507.62s]  for the
[1510.31s -> 1514.79s]  life in court. You started to learn about the world almost as soon as you could
[1514.79s -> 1519.27s]  walk and talk. You spent your early life as a page at
[1519.27s -> 1535.80s]  the nobleman's court. A street urchin? I'm a, I'm a, I'm a
[1535.80s -> 1540.22s]  politician. I get to play the part. As a boy growing out of childhood you
[1540.22s -> 1543.42s]  were sent to live in the court of one of the nobles of the land.
[1543.42s -> 1547.10s]  There your first lessons were in humility as you waited upon the lords
[1547.10s -> 1551.34s]  and ladies of the household. But from their chess games, their
[1551.34s -> 1554.30s]  gossip, even the poetry of great deeds and courtly love,
[1554.30s -> 1558.38s]  you quickly began to learn about the adult world of conflict and competition.
[1558.38s -> 1561.90s]  You also learned from the rough games of the other children
[1561.90s -> 1566.06s]  who battered at each other with sticks in imitation of their elder's swords.
[1566.06s -> 1569.42s]  Then as a young adult life changed, as it always does,
[1569.42s -> 1578.30s]  you became a game poacher, a
[1578.30s -> 1588.06s]  university student. I got a real fucking non-like video game life here, don't I?
[1588.06s -> 1596.46s]  But you're oh a thief, oh a peasant working my way as a warrior.
[1596.46s -> 1602.86s]  I read books. No, that's not a video game start.
[1602.86s -> 1606.94s]  No, the distinction felt certain to you. Somewhere along the way you'd become a
[1606.94s -> 1609.42s]  man and the whole world seemed to change
[1609.42s -> 1613.34s]  around you. You found yourself as a student in the
[1613.34s -> 1616.94s]  university of one of the great cities where you studied theology, philosophy
[1616.94s -> 1619.50s]  and medicine. But not all your lessons were learned
[1619.50s -> 1622.38s]  in the lecture halls. You may or may not have joined in with
[1622.38s -> 1625.34s]  your fellows as they roamed the alleys in search of wine, women
[1625.34s -> 1629.82s]  and a good fight. However, you certainly were able to observe how a broken jaw
[1629.82s -> 1632.78s]  is set. How an angry townsman can be persuaded to
[1632.78s -> 1636.22s]  set down his club and accept cash as compensation for the
[1636.22s -> 1641.62s]  destruction of his shop. But soon everything changed and you
[1641.62s -> 1644.18s]  decided to strike out on your own as an adventurer.
[1644.18s -> 1652.82s]  What made you take this decision was personal revenge.
[1652.82s -> 1656.66s]  Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an
[1656.66s -> 1659.96s]  adventurer. Still it was not a difficult choice to
[1659.96s -> 1663.99s]  leave with the rage burning brightly in your heart.
[1663.99s -> 1668.95s]  You want vengeance. You want justice. What was done to you cannot be undone and
[1668.95s -> 1679.18s]  these debts only to be paid in blood. Become an adventurer and ride to your
[1679.18s -> 1684.65s]  destiny. All right we got we got the noble houses
[1684.65s -> 1690.28s]  of Game of Thrones. House Lannister. House Tyrell. House
[1690.28s -> 1695.96s]  Stark. House uh what is it called? The Bears. What
[1695.96s -> 1699.08s]  are the Bears called? The Bears. The Bear. The Bears.

[1721.53s -> 1728.54s]  Competition. House Bird. No House uh Targaryen. House

[1739.10s -> 1743.21s]  Which one? Who did I pick? The three horsemen?
[1743.45s -> 1746.33s]  Okay I picked the three horsemen of the apocalypse. We don't need famine. Who
[1746.33s -> 1749.93s]  fucking cares? Uh no quitting without saving. Allow me
[1749.93s -> 1759.88s]  to quit without saving. Uh realistic. No allow me to fucking
[1759.88s -> 1763.32s]  I don't wait aren't these what are these both saying?
[1763.32s -> 1767.99s]  No quitting without saving. Allow me to quit
[1767.99s -> 1777.24s]  without saving. What is it how is what I mean realistic? So like if I exit the
[1777.24s -> 1783.53s]  game because I didn't like how that's just like allow me to save scum right?
[1783.53s -> 1788.78s]  Yeah allow me to save scum. I'm not gonna pick the first one are you
[1788.78s -> 1792.78s]  kidding me? What the hell would I do that for?
[1792.78s -> 1795.82s]  Now enter your name and distribute your attribute. You can scale and weapon
[1795.82s -> 1798.38s]  points. You can click on various elements on the
[1798.38s -> 1801.26s]  screen to learn how each one will affect your character.
[1801.26s -> 1804.78s]  All right I'm not doing I won't do that anymore. All right iron flesh power
[1804.78s -> 1813.40s]  strike power throw draw health 44 to 44 experience ball 43 next
[1813.40s -> 1817.29s]  level at 600. Oh god I don't know what the fuck I want
[1817.29s -> 1830.57s]  to do. I have no idea what any of this means.

[1864.44s -> 1868.30s]  uh strength agility I need to read these.
[1868.30s -> 1875.74s]  Every point adds plus one to hit points so this is health
[1875.74s -> 1882.65s]  and the following skills cannot be developed beyond one third of strength.
[1882.65s -> 1886.25s]  Agility each point gives you five gives five weapon points
[1886.33s -> 1893.82s]  and increased movement speed so this is weapon points and movement speed.
[1893.82s -> 1898.49s]  This next one is int every point intelligence immediately gives one extra
[1898.49s -> 1903.75s]  skill point so this is a skill point so this is for
[1903.75s -> 1908.38s]  this and then cha. Cha each point increases your party
[1908.38s -> 1911.34s]  limit size by plus one the following skills cannot be developed okay so this
[1911.34s -> 1916.82s]  is party limit. Those of you that are just
[1916.82s -> 1919.86s]  joining us in for the first time or that have never seen me play a game
[1919.86s -> 1923.78s]  like this I have no idea what to do. This is the first time I've ever opened
[1923.78s -> 1927.86s]  a mountain blade game ever. That's a lie. I opened this one like a
[1927.86s -> 1930.74s]  year and a half ago and like looked at the menu a little
[1930.74s -> 1938.84s]  bit. I don't know what to do and this is going to be terrible
[1938.84s -> 1940.84s]  because people are going to get so angry with me
[1940.84s -> 1944.36s]  because I'm going to put like two points into spotting and everyone's going to be
[1944.36s -> 1948.28s]  like why would you put points into spotting that's not
[1948.28s -> 1954.02s]  that's the worst thing you could have put it in. All right I'm going to go with
[1954.02s -> 1964.34s]  just basic dog shit I think I need some speed I get weapon points I'm putting a

[2045.69s -> 2061.18s]  throw shit at people okay first aid power throw
[2061.18s -> 2072.30s]  each point to this skill increases throwing damage by 10 percent

[2205.70s -> 2210.02s]  into it right guys each point to this skill increases melee damage by eight
[2210.02s -> 2216.78s]  percent that's pretty great let's character use
[2216.78s -> 2225.72s]  more powerful bows each point this oh it's one of those days I don't know
[2225.72s -> 2230.87s]  why I'm in one of these moods so this is like super bow makes it easier

[2850.44s -> 2853.64s]  at the risk of drifting ice and later winter storms could be justified by
[2853.64s -> 2857.72s]  arriving ahead of the sea raiders who by april would be sailing forth from
[2857.72s -> 2861.48s]  their island layers to ravage calradia's coasts
[2861.48s -> 2864.84s]  it was some relief when your ship came inside of the delta
[2864.84s -> 2870.12s]  of the vill and bollock rivers and a short while later road past tidal flats
[2870.12s -> 2873.16s]  and coastal marshes to the city of sargoth

[2878.87s -> 2882.39s]  who a few generations ago had carved themselves a kingdom in this rich but
[2882.39s -> 2887.61s]  troubled land okay you were exhausted by the time you
[2887.61s -> 2891.37s]  find the inn in sargoth and fall asleep quickly however you
[2891.37s -> 2894.17s]  awake before dawn and are eager to explore your surroundings
[2894.17s -> 2897.29s]  you venture out onto the streets which are still
[2897.29s -> 2902.01s]  deserted all of a sudden you hear a sound that stands the hairs of your neck
[2902.01s -> 2913.22s]  on end the rasp of a blade sliding from its scabbard
[2913.22s -> 2929.96s]  what is this guy oh the sound of a blade oh god
[2929.96s -> 2938.49s]  reload it reload it how do i what how do i change weapon do i have
[2938.49s -> 2952.89s]  another weapon it's this one person i can't reload
[2952.89s -> 2968.22s]  i got to punch him what what where am i how do i get out of here
[2968.22s -> 2995.35s]  give me the fucking bow he can kick okay seriously though like i need to
[2995.67s -> 3004.25s]  i need to why do i not have a weapon scroll up what the tutorial didn't
[3004.25s -> 3023.59s]  tell me scroll up oh god who's this who's this i did the
[3023.59s -> 3026.79s]  whole tutorial not once did they say by the way make sure you scroll up
[3026.79s -> 3030.55s]  is to get your melee weapon and scroll down is for your shield
[3030.55s -> 3037.48s]  who the fuck are you are you all right well i guess you're alive at any rate
[3037.48s -> 3040.60s]  i'm not sure that we can say the same for the other fellow that's one less
[3040.60s -> 3043.96s]  thief to trouble our streets at night although heaven knows he won't be the
[3043.96s -> 3047.38s]  last anyway maybe you can help me with
[3047.38s -> 3049.94s]  something let's talk more inside out here we
[3049.94s -> 3058.12s]  don't know who's listening uh the merchant takes you to his house
[3058.12s -> 3060.68s]  once inside he stands by the door for a while checking the street and then
[3060.68s -> 3065.08s]  finally convinced you've not been followed comes near you to speed
[3065.08s -> 3074.79s]  it's a lie he's coming to kill me so can i reload this
[3074.79s -> 3083.83s]  oops i can't take my bolts back sorry i was just testing that
[3083.83s -> 3092.66s]  all right what do we need uh now let me explain my proposition
[3092.66s -> 3098.42s]  we've always had brigands in the hills driven to banditry by war debt or love
[3098.42s -> 3101.06s]  of violence recently however they've been getting
[3101.06s -> 3103.78s]  bolder leaving their camps in the wild and
[3103.78s -> 3110.97s]  venturing into town looking for unwary prey the
[3110.97s -> 3113.93s]  the watch commander tells us it's because of all the fighting on the
[3113.93s -> 3116.81s]  frontiers fewer men to keep an eye on the streets
[3116.81s -> 3120.57s]  but i'm not sure what to make of that it seems to me that the most logical
[3120.57s -> 3124.41s]  explanation is that these bandits have an ally inside the walls
[3124.41s -> 3127.85s]  who helps them enter unnoticed and helps them identify particularly tempting
[3127.85s -> 3134.04s]  targets last week you see they took my brother i
[3134.04s -> 3137.48s]  don't know what my brother was thinking a lad from a prominent house this is
[3137.48s -> 3142.52s]  just a bad uh this is a bad audiobook this is like
[3142.52s -> 3146.60s]  they outsourced the audiobook to like fiber is what i'm doing right
[3146.60s -> 3150.79s]  now seriously i don't know what my brother was
[3150.79s -> 3153.43s]  thinking a lad from a prominent house out alone
[3153.43s -> 3157.91s]  after dark in times like these well i suppose you were too but you're
[3157.91s -> 3160.87s]  a stranger here and didn't know how bad things have
[3160.87s -> 3164.47s]  become he had no such excuse but he's family
[3164.47s -> 3168.39s]  so what can you do if you don't protect your kin then people will start
[3168.39s -> 3171.11s]  thinking that you can't protect your investments either
[3171.11s -> 3175.91s]  and i can't have that no doubt the gang will soon send word about a ransom
[3175.91s -> 3183.35s]  but i don't care to pay it do a nord voice i don't know what that means
[3183.67s -> 3189.24s]  what do you mean a nord voice so here's my proposition now that i can only do
[3189.24s -> 3202.34s]  irish so here's my proposition you look like
[3202.34s -> 3204.50s]  you've had a bit of experience with the blade
[3204.50s -> 3207.86s]  and more importantly you must have a bit of fire in your belly
[3207.86s -> 3211.22s]  or you wouldn't be coming to calradia to seek your fortune
[3211.22s -> 3215.19s]  so here's what i'm asking you to do gather a small party
[3215.19s -> 3219.11s]  track down these bandits to their lair teach them a lesson they won't forget
[3219.11s -> 3223.88s]  and get my brother back safe in return you'll earn my lasting gratitude
[3223.88s -> 3237.48s]  in a bit of silver what do you say you fucking nailed it you won't be able to
[3237.48s -> 3240.52s]  do this by yourself though if you try and take on the whole gang of
[3240.52s -> 3244.60s]  single-handedly the hunter will become the hunted and i'll warrant
[3244.60s -> 3249.00s]  you'll first want to round up a group of volunteers there's always a few lads in
[3249.00s -> 3251.64s]  the villages around here looking for a bit of work that's
[3251.64s -> 3255.32s]  more interesting than tilling the soil or hauling water they'll follow you if you
[3255.32s -> 3259.91s]  pay so take this purse of a hundred denars
[3259.91s -> 3263.75s]  consider it an advance on your reward go around to the villages and use the
[3263.75s -> 3266.63s]  money to hire some help i'll reckon that you need at least five
[3266.63s -> 3274.95s]  men to take on these bandits five men very good sir i'll go collect some
[3274.95s -> 3279.46s]  men from the other villages good you can find me in the tavern here
[3279.46s -> 3283.30s]  in sargoth after you've got your group together then we'll

[3342.62s -> 3346.06s]  craftsmen do a thriving business and some migrants appear to be coming here
[3346.06s -> 3350.22s]  from other regions to seek their luck you see the banner of king ragnar
[3350.22s -> 3353.02s]  of kingdom of nords over the town gates the populace

[6066.94s -> 6069.74s]  means that only a handful of troops in your party will be able to join the
[6069.74s -> 6072.70s]  attack and they will be unable to bring their horses
[6072.70s -> 6076.70s]  if your initial attack fails the looters will easily be able to make their escape
[6076.70s -> 6079.58s]  and disperse do you wish to attack the hideout or wait
[6079.58s -> 6090.49s]  for another occasion uh they're not what other occasion is

[6367.83s -> 6370.55s]  advise you to return to your family as quickly as you can and be careful on
[6370.55s -> 6376.04s]  that road with their retreat out cut off the looters fall one by one to

[6391.58s -> 6407.27s]  fuck was that granite or is that uh cement whatever i gotta sell these uh

[6415.54s -> 6419.78s]  look at all this shit i have so many like fishing knives
[6419.78s -> 6423.30s]  this is just like the showtime knife set by fucking ron papeal these things are
[6423.30s -> 6426.63s]  terrible that but hold on but hold on a minute
[6426.63s -> 6429.03s]  here that's not to say that the showtime
[6429.03s -> 6434.47s]  knife set is not a high quality knife set because it is showtime rotisserie i
[6434.47s -> 6436.63s]  mean ron papeal makes some great products
[6436.63s -> 6448.38s]  i didn't want to make anyone think that i thought that he didn't diamond rocks
[6448.38s -> 6456.58s]  just pick up the most expensive shit yeah
[6456.58s -> 6464.44s]  it's pretty much all i can get what did i pick up to like what dumb shit did i
[6464.44s -> 6467.78s]  pick up here self right you get fucking rid of this
[6467.78s -> 6476.33s]  sell price 12 sell price 12 57 57 57 16 16 16
[6476.33s -> 6488.38s]  definitely 75 57 so he did it attack the bandit lair
[6488.38s -> 6491.11s]  the quest has been successfully completed talk to the merchant of sargoth
[6491.11s -> 6495.93s]  to claim your reward did i level up at all i didn't even
[6495.93s -> 6499.13s]  level up from that i don't even like this game i'm
[6499.13s -> 6504.98s]  pretending to like it all right let's go with uh 20 days
[6504.98s -> 6510.73s]  footman and uh huntsman i'm just kidding i'm kidding this is this game is very
[6510.73s -> 6518.18s]  fun i'm kidding my god well i'm not allowed
[6518.18s -> 6526.49s]  to have a little fun all right let's go gotta go to sargoth
[6526.49s -> 6533.00s]  save this fucking game i thought this game was like a strategy game
[6533.00s -> 6538.34s]  i didn't know it was like this i think every screenshot and every
[6538.34s -> 6542.36s]  piece of video clip i've ever seen of this game was like this
[6542.36s -> 6545.96s]  let's take a click here eight versus your five i win
[6545.96s -> 6562.97s]  i didn't know it was this fun jeremy you were just using strategy commands
[6562.97s -> 6569.26s]  in game yeah but it's different though in game real time strategy right
[6569.50s -> 6579.34s]  rts is what they it's called real time in game strategy why are you going so
[6579.34s -> 6584.90s]  slow what's wrong with you hurry up why are
[6584.90s -> 6596.22s]  you going so slow hurry the fuck up it's night time
[6596.22s -> 6601.61s]  that means you ride slower whoa look at that that guy 51 people in his party i
[6601.61s -> 6606.74s]  can't wait to fucking slaughter that guy all right so we're gonna go to the um
[6606.74s -> 6612.71s]  market place see if we can get the armor guy to take some of the stuff off of our
[6612.71s -> 6617.27s]  hands this is 14 12 12 12 none of this scared of all of it
[6617.27s -> 6628.33s]  uh what else we got this is dumb shitty stupid all right that's good
[6628.33s -> 6631.53s]  let's go to the arms merchant i got some stuff for you here
[6631.53s -> 6642.07s]  why i thought this these said they were selling for like 75
[6642.07s -> 6645.43s]  wait maybe i could put one of these on rusty sword
[6645.43s -> 6652.63s]  versus rusty chipped is just a regular foul shit okay
[6652.63s -> 6656.55s]  98 weapon reads 73 price strength 8 how can you tell what how much damage it
[6656.55s -> 6669.59s]  does 24 versus 19 i guess 30 anything has to be better than rusty
[6669.59s -> 6682.34s]  sword all right it's like 18 18 18 18 got plenty of food all right let's go
[6682.34s -> 6692.44s]  to the tower complete the quest did your brother come in yet
[6692.44s -> 6695.96s]  well my brother is home safe i'm not sure what to do with him maybe
[6695.96s -> 6699.16s]  pack him off to a university outside calradia
[6699.16s -> 6703.16s]  that way if he gets knocked on the head in a street brawl no one can say it's my
[6703.16s -> 6705.56s]  fault but that's not your problem here's the
[6705.56s -> 6712.58s]  rest of your reward it was well earned thanks man oh the money is most welcome
[6712.58s -> 6716.74s]  and i'm glad to have been of service thanks good now are you interested in
[6716.74s -> 6721.94s]  making some more yeah what do you got remember how i told
[6721.94s -> 6727.29s]  you that the bandits had an ally inside the walls i think i know who that
[6727.29s -> 6730.66s]  is the captain of the watch no less some
[6730.66s -> 6734.66s]  months ago the captain seeking the amount of profit we merchants were
[6734.66s -> 6738.66s]  making from trade across the frontiers decided to borrow some money to sponsor
[6738.66s -> 6743.30s]  a caravan unfortunately like many who are new to
[6743.30s -> 6747.38s]  commerce he failed to realize that great profit only comes with great risk
[6747.38s -> 6751.30s]  so he sank all of his money into the most expensive commodities and of course
[6751.30s -> 6758.86s]  his caravan was captured and looted and he lost everything
[6758.86s -> 6762.54s]  as a consequence it seems our captain turned to villainy
[6762.54s -> 6767.18s]  to recoup his fortune i supposed i'd do the same if the heavens forbid
[6767.18s -> 6772.38s]  i ever faced indebtedness and ruination now any watch captain worth his salary
[6772.38s -> 6775.50s]  will have a few thieves and robbers on his payroll
[6775.50s -> 6780.46s]  to inform on the rest but our captain decides to employ these bandits
[6780.46s -> 6783.10s]  wholesale he brings them into the town lets them
[6783.10s -> 6786.14s]  do as they will and takes a share of their take
[6786.14s -> 6789.58s]  you've heard of poachers turning gamekeepers well
[6789.66s -> 6795.50s]  in the most unfortunate land of calradia sometimes gamekeepers will turn poacher
[6795.50s -> 6799.58s]  luckily there's are there's still a few brave honest souls in the watch who've
[6799.58s -> 6807.21s]  told me how he works now here's my plan i could bring this to
[6807.21s -> 6812.17s]  the attention of king rasner lord of the city but that would mean an
[6812.17s -> 6816.09s]  inquiry my world against the captains and when
[6816.09s -> 6820.01s]  this can be brought to evidence destroyed oh maybe the whole thing will
[6820.01s -> 6822.98s]  be forgotten if the enemy comes across the border
[6822.98s -> 6827.16s]  again and all i'll get for my trouble is a knife
[6827.16s -> 6829.96s]  in the ribs in time of war you see a king's eye
[6829.96s -> 6835.14s]  wanders far from his domain and the subjects suffer so i've got
[6835.14s -> 6837.96s]  another idea i've got a small group of townsfolk
[6837.96s -> 6841.40s]  together some men in my employ and some others who've lost relatives to these
[6841.40s -> 6844.92s]  bandits and will storm the captain's home and
[6844.92s -> 6849.77s]  bring him in chains before king ragnar hopefully with a few captured bandits to
[6849.77s -> 6854.07s]  explain how he fucked it up so much all i need now
[6854.07s -> 6856.95s]  is someone to lead my little army into battle and i can't think of anyone
[6856.95s -> 6862.39s]  better than you so what do you say yeah how do i know that you're telling
[6862.39s -> 6865.67s]  me the truth oh well i suppose it's possible that i
[6865.67s -> 6868.07s]  found a dozen bandits who were willing to give their lives to give a passing
[6868.07s -> 6870.47s]  stranger a false impression of life and old star star god
[6870.47s -> 6873.03s]  oh well i guess you can't really know if my word is good but i reckon you've
[6873.03s -> 6875.75s]  learned by now that my money is good and there's another hundred dinners
[6875.75s -> 6880.07s]  or maybe a bit more that's waiting for you if you'll do me this little last
[6880.07s -> 6898.26s]  favor so what do you say so this could be false too much
[6898.26s -> 6905.42s]  no fuck it let's go splendid it's been a long time since i stake so much on a
[6905.42s -> 6908.79s]  single throw of the dice and frankly i find it exhilarating
[6908.79s -> 6913.50s]  my men are ready to move on your word are you ready i don't want to be treated
[6913.50s -> 6918.71s]  like a fucking goddamn craps table where's the option to
[6918.71s -> 6924.17s]  fucking spin around i can get him on the neck yes give
[6924.17s -> 6931.11s]  them the sign good now strike hard strike fast and the
[6931.11s -> 6933.35s]  captain and his henchmen won't know what hit them
[6933.35s -> 6937.64s]  may the heavens be with you this guy's crazy
[6937.64s -> 6950.38s]  me crazy streamer this is this i'm role playing you leave the tavern
[6950.38s -> 6953.34s]  and go out to the streets nervous looking young men are waiting in
[6953.34s -> 6956.46s]  every street corner you can say they have daggers and clubs
[6956.46s -> 6961.59s]  concealed under their clothes and catch a mixture of fear anticipation
[6961.59s -> 6964.47s]  and pride in the quick looks that they throw at you
[6964.47s -> 6968.86s]  as you pass by praying that your enemies have not been alarmed by this all to
[6968.86s -> 6973.99s]  obvious bunch of plotters you check your weapons for one last time
[6973.99s -> 6985.06s]  and prepare yourself for the action ahead okay there it
[6985.06s -> 6990.81s]  it's time lads up and at them these are my face what the fuck
[6990.81s -> 7009.14s]  this guy's got a bat that guy's a fucking baseball bat
[7009.14s -> 7024.78s]  okay it's like a flaming fucking plus two magic sword
[7024.78s -> 7037.96s]  now the dogs are barking there's one more guy
[7037.96s -> 7042.60s]  looter killed by nord lord lord nord the remaining few men to scatter off to the
[7042.60s -> 7046.70s]  town's narrow alleys only to be hunted down one by one by
[7046.70s -> 7050.54s]  the angry townsfolk making sure that your victory is complete
[7050.54s -> 7053.74s]  and all the wounded have been taken care of you and the merchant head to his
[7053.74s -> 7065.10s]  house to review the day's events i don't think germa could be any worse
[7065.10s -> 7069.82s]  at this game well here's the thing i i've i put all
[7069.82s -> 7074.87s]  my points into throwing rocks at people so if i was using the sword this would
[7074.87s -> 7077.03s]  probably go a lot differently but i'm doing the
[7077.03s -> 7092.14s]  throwing stuff why because more like 201 guys in chat told me to do it
[7092.14s -> 7095.42s]  well done i hear you counted for one or two of the bastards and you're still on
[7095.42s -> 7097.90s]  your feet you can't ask for a better outcome of a battle
[7097.90s -> 7101.26s]  than that unfortunately about eight of my lads got themselves wounded i should
[7101.26s -> 7113.67s]  go look on them i'm not bad at the game i just made
[7113.67s -> 7117.59s]  bad decisions yeah it was the first time i've ever played it i'm just like
[7117.59s -> 7122.55s]  what you you want me to do like the meta play pick like the best things possible
[7122.55s -> 7126.20s]  in the first playthrough first time to play the game
[7126.20s -> 7138.89s]  no i want to throw rocks at people i want to throw rocks at people's heads
[7138.89s -> 7141.29s]  and that's eventually going to turn the throwing axes and that's eventually
[7141.29s -> 7146.22s]  going to turn into javelins and i will be unkillable in about 15
[7146.22s -> 7158.65s]  minutes all right i got yeah i killed a couple
[7158.65s -> 7166.41s]  of them ah well i'm proud to have done my bit along with the rest
[7166.41s -> 7170.09s]  yes yes now a couple of my boys have the watch captain pinned down in a back room
[7170.09s -> 7174.22s]  with a knife at his throat i'll need to go drag him before king
[7174.22s -> 7176.86s]  ragnar explained what this breach of the peace is all about
[7176.86s -> 7180.54s]  you don't need to be part of that though i'll tell you
[7180.54s -> 7184.30s]  what if all goes well i'll meet you in the tavern again shortly and i'll let you
[7184.30s -> 7187.75s]  know how it all came out if you don't save before this
[7187.75s -> 7192.47s]  encounter you're going to be very upset instead see my head on a spike over the
[7192.47s -> 7194.63s]  city gate i will assume you know enough to stay out
[7194.63s -> 7197.03s]  of town for a while and forget this whole episode ever happened
[7197.03s -> 7209.03s]  hopefully we'll meet again so this guy's dead i mean these this guy's gonna die
[7209.03s -> 7217.19s]  so he said make sure you save again all right uh let's go to
[7217.19s -> 7226.01s]  the marketplace arms merchant all right let me see what i got 728 throwing axes

[7271.72s -> 7277.50s]  darts no the bargain bin is even lower down
[7277.50s -> 7282.98s]  which what's it called throwing knife butchering knife
[7283.06s -> 7291.24s]  rusty rusty club scythe war spear bent bolts
[7291.24s -> 7300.60s]  it's like the club just put two rocks together
[7300.60s -> 7318.28s]  times two damage well i'm gonna get these i can just pick them up right there are
[7318.28s -> 7320.52s]  only seven of them yeah but i can get them right
[7320.52s -> 7335.50s]  i can pick them up and get them seven per battle okay that's not bad
[7335.50s -> 7339.59s]  that's double the damage i told you it's gonna take 15 minutes
[7339.59s -> 7346.25s]  everyone was mad that i didn't get like arming sword plus 10 strength
[7346.25s -> 7354.26s]  now i've got lawn darts get rid of the rocks
[7354.26s -> 7370.07s]  but it's sentimental okay that's fine i do want i want the throwing look at that
[7370.07s -> 7379.05s]  damage on that shit it's gonna be good i will never read this book all right
[7379.05s -> 7388.10s]  that's all right i got a better throwing weapon now and i have power throw
[7388.10s -> 7393.69s]  enter the arena no i'm not ready for the arena
[7393.69s -> 7399.56s]  so now uh i i got nothing right just kind of go
[7399.56s -> 7412.74s]  the arena is just it's easy oh well let's just do the arena
[7412.74s -> 7422.41s]  hold on enter the arena good day friend if you come to watch the tournaments you
[7422.41s -> 7425.61s]  came in vain there won't be a tournament here anytime soon
[7425.61s -> 7429.21s]  tournaments so they hold the tournaments here yes that's what i just told you
[7429.21s -> 7432.17s]  uh you should see this place during one of the tournament fights everyone from
[7432.17s -> 7437.13s]  this town and nearby villages comes here the crowd becomes mad with excitement
[7437.13s -> 7441.29s]  anyway as i said there won't be an event here soon so there isn't much to see
[7441.29s -> 7444.65s]  except as an official duel every now and then and of course
[7444.65s -> 7448.10s]  we have melee fights every day totally welcome
[7448.10s -> 7451.56s]  the fighters and knights get bored waiting for the next tournament so they
[7451.56s -> 7455.80s]  have invented the training melee it's a simple idea fighters jump into
[7455.80s -> 7459.40s]  the arena with a weapon there are no rules no teams everyone
[7459.40s -> 7464.04s]  beats at each other until there is only one fighter left standing
[7464.04s -> 7468.54s]  okay there is actually some of the wealthy townsmen
[7468.54s -> 7472.22s]  offer prizes for those fighters who show great skill in the fights
[7472.22s -> 7475.42s]  if you can beat three opponents before going down you'll earn
[7475.42s -> 7481.03s]  five dollars that doesn't seem worth it you'll get ten dollars for striking
[7481.03s -> 7485.67s]  down at least six people 25 if you can defeat 10 and 60 if you

[7851.59s -> 7856.79s]  pretty sure you maybe you should do this on a later date
[7856.79s -> 7859.35s]  of course i'm new to the game that's what that means that that's that's
[7859.35s -> 7881.99s]  supposed to be an insult to me auto block makes it harder
[7881.99s -> 7887.61s]  look i'll turn off auto block in like an hour
[7887.61s -> 7893.30s]  so now what the hell am i supposed to do now need to go find stuff to do
[7893.30s -> 7902.33s]  i want to buy a new weapon i was already here i already got a new weapon
[7902.33s -> 7911.74s]  all right um let's go to the tavern because they was like oh what's there to
[7911.74s -> 7916.84s]  do around here right you heard of anyone in the realm who
[7916.84s -> 7920.98s]  might have a job for me king ragnar is always looking for
[7920.98s -> 7926.01s]  mercenaries to fight in the wars let me think jarl sirdin has been asking
[7926.01s -> 7929.37s]  around for someone who might want work i'd watch yourself with him though you
[7929.37s -> 7934.17s]  may want to speak with him let me think other work lords and guild
[7934.17s -> 7936.89s]  masters often have other tasks which we don't hear about
[7936.89s -> 7941.45s]  the villages around here frequently need help all right i'll keep my ears open
[7941.45s -> 7947.93s]  all right so we got there's what was that guy's name
[7947.93s -> 7958.65s]  just look at all these people's names that there's like a hundred jarls what
[7958.65s -> 7979.90s]  was that guy's name you got like a fucking bunch of them
[7979.90s -> 7998.90s]  it's a title i thought it was like john iria john herald john heda john gundor
[7998.90s -> 8006.57s]  yarl all right what was this guy's name again king
[8006.57s -> 8011.18s]  jarl sirdin thank you i've heard enough where are you
[8011.18s -> 8019.18s]  jarl let's let's go find this guy jarl sirdin is a
[8019.18s -> 8026.87s]  vassal of king ragnar of kingdom of nords he is the lord of bullen boilin
[8026.87s -> 8031.00s]  builin so we're gonna go to builin where's builin view the village of builin
[8031.00s -> 8035.88s]  near chalbeck castle belongs to jarl and he's
[8035.88s -> 8044.87s]  rich okay chalbeck castle belongs to okay so
[8044.87s -> 8048.95s]  we got a village it's good builin we're going to find builin it's
[8048.95s -> 8070.98s]  near chalbeck castle that's far fucking away so i can go here
[8070.98s -> 8074.42s]  all right that's that's this one option is to go kind of from the
[8074.42s -> 8080.46s]  what like cape cod in massachusetts what are the other
[8080.46s -> 8090.74s]  scenarios there this is a virgin again ah carton things didn't go quite so well
[8090.74s -> 8093.14s]  as i'd hope king ragnar couldn't quite find it and
[8093.14s -> 8096.74s]  overlooked my little breach of the peace oh he's grateful enough that i got rid
[8096.82s -> 8100.74s]  of his crooked captain a guard who led in bandits will
[8100.74s -> 8103.54s]  let an enemy army if the price is right but he can't
[8103.54s -> 8106.82s]  exactly have me running around here as a lasting reminder of his failure to take
[8106.82s -> 8111.64s]  care of things that's not fair uh feral this is calradia my
[8111.64s -> 8115.08s]  boy kings do what they will and the rest of us do as they must
[8115.08s -> 8118.44s]  he didn't string me up and instead gave me time to sell my properties
[8118.44s -> 8121.56s]  even put in a word with the other merchants that they best pay me a fair
[8121.56s -> 8124.65s]  price too
[8124.81s -> 8127.85s]  she knows that's gracious enough as kings go but he's a weak
[8127.85s -> 8134.97s]  king as they all are here are weak kings and weak kings must always look to their
[8134.97s -> 8138.49s]  authority first and just a second i suppose i'll do the same in his
[8138.49s -> 8142.70s]  shoes anyway i wouldn't go rubbing your part in
[8142.70s -> 8147.93s]  this affair that's a weird way to say that i wouldn't
[8147.93s -> 8152.57s]  go rubbing your part in king ragnar's face i didn't plan on it
[8152.57s -> 8155.93s]  but he's taken note of you and decided that you're not worth hanging
[8155.93s -> 8159.61s]  and that's something to which i'll raise a glass any day he might even have
[8159.61s -> 8163.21s]  work for you further down the road or you can sell
[8163.21s -> 8166.73s]  your sword to one of his competitors anyway i hope you've learned a bit
[8166.73s -> 8169.69s]  about what it will take to stay alive in this troubled land and i suspect that
[8169.69s -> 8173.29s]  the money you've earned won't go to waste good luck
[8173.29s -> 8184.50s]  so we can go talk to the king so let me see here we've got characters
[8184.50s -> 8187.46s]  what's his name king jarl i don't remember what his fucking name is
[8187.46s -> 8191.59s]  there it is the ruler of the kingdom of nords
[8191.59s -> 8196.15s]  he is the lord of sargoth the last time you saw him king ragnar was at sargoth

[9023.18s -> 9025.50s]  things and it's gotten me into trouble you see
[9025.50s -> 9029.10s]  i grew up in mallier castle as a bonded servant working alongside my mother in
[9029.10s -> 9031.74s]  the kitchens i would just amuse myself by hunting mice
[9031.74s -> 9035.50s]  through the pantries and sculleries i was so gutted that i put the castle cats
[9035.50s -> 9038.54s]  out of a job and eventually the lord realized that i might also be employed to
[9038.54s -> 9042.06s]  track down figure game on certain errands of a type perhaps better
[9042.06s -> 9046.46s]  left unsaid uh needless to say i found a number of opportunities to avail myself
[9046.46s -> 9049.34s]  of trinkets that formerly belonged to my lord's
[9049.34s -> 9053.18s]  enemies buy myself out of bondage and find a
[9053.18s -> 9059.34s]  hire as a free agent my job was here unfortunately my last employer's wife had

[9084.12s -> 9094.58s]  looking down here one two three four five what's in my ribs

[9103.38s -> 9113.64s]  i can throw i can stab and i'm slippery you'll find me useful in a fight that's
[9113.64s -> 9115.80s]  good so how about paying me a little something
[9115.80s -> 9119.08s]  to seal off our agreement a mere 200 would be enough
[9119.08s -> 9123.05s]  please don't take this the wrong way but i've had some bad luck with employers
[9123.05s -> 9130.14s]  you go fuck yourself you're not getting 200 dollars
[9130.14s -> 9137.10s]  me and five of my mates are looking for a master will join you for 15.96
[9137.10s -> 9144.57s]  two two four six eight ten fuck that she's there you guys are more expensive
[9144.57s -> 9154.09s]  what about you you do well to know me i travel a lot across colorado
[9154.09s -> 9159.91s]  and keep an open ear i can provide you information that you might find useful
[9159.91s -> 9165.05s]  um what can you tell me about this land divide into rival kingdoms which can
[9165.05s -> 9167.93s]  neither manage to live in peace with their neighbors nor completely eliminate
[9167.93s -> 9170.92s]  them as a result there's seldom a break to
[9170.92s -> 9174.60s]  the bitter wars which plague this land and drain its life blood
[9174.60s -> 9177.56s]  this must be a good place to be for an adventure such as yourself
[9177.56s -> 9181.48s]  with some luck and skill you can make slow the fuck down
[9181.48s -> 9188.84s]  you're going way too fast why does everyone want to go so fast
[9188.84s -> 9194.82s]  those kind of speeds scare me that's a that's scary speed
[9194.82s -> 9203.10s]  you go over like 45 and i start to get nervous
[9203.10s -> 9209.24s]  um what were we doing opportunities are endless and so are the rewards if you're
[9209.24s -> 9213.48s]  willing to risk your life for them tell me about these opportunities the
[9213.48s -> 9216.28s]  kingdoms will pay good money for missionaries if they are engaged in a
[9216.28s -> 9219.70s]  war if you've done a bit of fighting speaking
[9219.70s -> 9222.82s]  with one of their lords will probably result in being offered a mercenary
[9222.82s -> 9225.94s]  contract the real rewards however come if you can
[9225.94s -> 9231.83s]  manage to become a vessel to a king a vessel can own villages castles
[9231.83s -> 9236.31s]  and towns and get rich with the taxes and revenues of these estates
[9236.31s -> 9241.86s]  okay a king will not hesitate in time of war to accept someone who's
[9241.86s -> 9244.02s]  distinguished himself on the battlefield as a vessel
[9244.02s -> 9249.91s]  and grant him the right to own land not unheard of for adventures to renounce
[9249.91s -> 9255.03s]  allegiance to a calradian king altogether declare themselves kings and
[9255.03s -> 9257.59s]  claim land in their own name just like the video game
[9257.59s -> 9261.27s]  board game risk this is a difficult path however as the great nobles of the land
[9261.27s -> 9266.23s]  with their long long arms are not likely to accept such upstarts
[9266.23s -> 9273.22s]  as their monarch okay uh it might be easier for an
[9273.22s -> 9279.93s]  adventurer like yourself to pledge support to an existing king's rival
[9279.93s -> 9283.29s]  there may there are many such pretenders in calradia
[9283.29s -> 9287.32s]  those who are born to the right family who go around and stir up trouble
[9287.32s -> 9290.76s]  those claim holders could find supporters they could easily start civil
[9290.76s -> 9297.56s]  wars and perhaps even replace the king give me a name a claim holder's life
[9297.56s -> 9300.92s]  would be in danger in his own country of course therefore they usually start
[9300.92s -> 9305.18s]  they had rival courts i usually hear news about some of them
[9305.18s -> 9307.66s]  and may be able to tell you their location with some precision but of
[9307.66s -> 9313.14s]  course i would ask for a little something um i want to know the location
[9313.14s -> 9336.10s]  of a claimant i want to know uh lady is sola of suno

[11266.07s -> 11270.01s]  didn't like let me put it on easy this is just whatever the default setting
[11270.01s -> 11291.13s]  is uh okay hold on uh can't pour pour
[11291.13s -> 11304.60s]  average average i don't good i don't know why that didn't change this
[11304.60s -> 11311.58s]  uh amco the terrible just gave 50 dollars
[11311.58s -> 11317.13s]  thank you amco the temple for 50 bucks big money
[11317.13s -> 11320.89s]  and they say ignore chat keep playing the way that you like and have fun with
[11320.89s -> 11326.18s]  the normal mode of warband is super hard and frustrating
[11326.42s -> 11335.99s]  just starting out just have fun i don't want you to abandon this game
[11335.99s -> 11342.52s]  he's what what it's right it's good advice
[11342.52s -> 11345.56s]  increase difficulty abandon probably bullshit but
[11345.56s -> 11357.93s]  what uh well i can change this at any time so this is if i don't like this i'm
[11357.93s -> 11359.45s]  going to put it back down to where it was
[11359.45s -> 11369.19s]  on the default i mean turn up the battle size
[11369.19s -> 11384.04s]  okay damage to the player wait damage to friends damage to player
[11384.04s -> 11389.80s]  so wait why the hell would they have this all on easy
[11389.80s -> 11393.00s]  as the default setting then is the game just that difficult
[11393.00s -> 11402.79s]  so am i am i gonna now just like lose every fight no
[11402.79s -> 11417.59s]  fuck that i don't know what this is on lance control what was it

[13708.82s -> 13714.23s]  center where is everybody town's woman uh what can you tell me
[13714.23s -> 13718.55s]  about this town a town surrounding lands belong to king yarrow glick of kingdom
[13718.55s -> 13723.19s]  of vaguers we mostly produce bread and a bunch of
[13723.19s -> 13725.83s]  other stupid shit if you'd like to learn more you can
[13725.83s -> 13738.23s]  speak with our guild master he's nearby right over there okay
[13738.23s -> 13743.26s]  guild master what you do do you ever have a job i have some questions of
[13743.26s -> 13746.62s]  political nature politics good heaven the guild has nothing
[13746.62s -> 13749.66s]  to do with politics we're loyal servants of king yarrow glick
[13749.66s -> 13753.42s]  we merely govern our own affairs and pass on the townspeople's concern to our
[13753.42s -> 13758.74s]  lord what did you want to ask uh what do you
[13758.74s -> 13768.70s]  think about politics okay internal bickering in other realms
[13768.70s -> 13772.46s]  the lords of a realm often have very different ideas about honor strategy and
[13772.46s -> 13775.66s]  the way a nobleman should behave they compete with each other for the
[13775.66s -> 13779.16s]  ruler's favor constantly weighing up their position how
[13779.16s -> 13786.97s]  they stand how their friends and family stand right
[13786.97s -> 13790.57s]  yeah it's about like oh you can sneak in and pull the rug from under somebody
[13790.57s -> 13797.43s]  and now you're a lord he believes that this is going to
[13797.43s -> 13800.63s]  change sides or rebel he may indict the vessel for treason and seize his
[13800.71s -> 13808.36s]  properties all right i got i'm i got nobody
[13808.36s -> 13818.54s]  i'm not i don't i'm good all right you got any work
[13818.54s -> 13821.90s]  uh one of the merchants here is looking for a herdsman to take his cattle
[13821.90s -> 13826.98s]  we already know that's a failure i wish to buy
[13826.98s -> 13834.90s]  land in this town for a productive enterprise
[13834.90s -> 13840.26s]  uh what do i want to do a couple of things to keep in mind skilled laborers
[13840.26s -> 13843.86s]  are always at a premium so i doubt that you will be able to open up more than
[13843.86s -> 13848.34s]  one enterprise here in order to make a profit for yourself
[13848.34s -> 13851.94s]  you should choose a commodity which is in relatively short supply
[13851.94s -> 13857.82s]  but for which the raw materials are cheap uh they do lots of bread
[13857.82s -> 13863.78s]  they do a lot of bread hold on never mind
[13863.78s -> 13870.66s]  how's the trade we have shortages of wool
[13870.66s -> 13873.78s]  smoked fish grapes grain pork and some other commodities
[13873.78s -> 13883.24s]  wool so i'm gonna make a i'm gonna make a wool factory
[13883.24s -> 13889.38s]  uh i'm just getting i'm getting like a virus update what the fuck are you doing
[13889.38s -> 13898.10s]  no i don't why is it taken off my computer give me a break
[13898.10s -> 13901.06s]  we have received many traders in town who travel is coming from where chagat
[13901.06s -> 13906.15s]  traded here two days ago okay there's little news about the
[13906.15s -> 13912.36s]  caravan routes to towns yeah yeah yeah okay so we need
[13912.36s -> 13918.42s]  how does the wealth of this region compare the rest of calradia
[13918.42s -> 13923.27s]  we are poorer than three towns and richer than 18
[13923.27s -> 13931.11s]  okay we produce less than seven towns and produce more than 14
[13931.11s -> 13935.48s]  production is of course this is one of those brain teasers
[13935.48s -> 13939.56s]  jane has six jelly beans if mark comes over
[13939.56s -> 13943.72s]  and takes two jelly beans and then gives them back three weeks later and she
[13943.72s -> 13953.77s]  produces 12 jelly beans a day i don't want to do that
[13953.77s -> 13962.09s]  looting and pillage and shifts in territory can make a major impact
[13962.09s -> 13967.69s]  okay the village is produced less than the hinderlin around eight towns produce
[13967.69s -> 13971.38s]  more than 13 the wealth of a town's hinder than of
[13971.38s -> 13974.26s]  course is heavily dependent on the tides of war
[13974.26s -> 13979.45s]  the town of suno is believed to have received the most visits from caravans
[13979.45s -> 13985.80s]  we have visited we are less visited than four towns and more visited than 17
[13985.80s -> 13989.88s]  in terms of attacks on travelers the town of dirum is believed to be the most
[13989.88s -> 13993.56s]  dangerous here we are less afflicted by bandits
[13993.56s -> 14001.59s]  and raiders than 12 towns and more afflicted than nine
[14001.59s -> 14006.33s]  i thought that was a middle finger all right i'm gonna buy a productive
[14006.33s -> 14015.72s]  enterprise and it's gonna be wool a weavery to make wool
[14015.72s -> 14025.70s]  cloth from wool they get a shortage of it a weavery and
[14025.70s -> 14035.11s]  dye works to make velvet from silk and dye check how much you make each week on
[14035.11s -> 14040.23s]  every option very good so the land of the materials
[14040.23s -> 14044.50s]  on which you may build your mill will cost you 1500
[14044.50s -> 14050.18s]  300 dollars a week 264 and labeled with 30
[14050.18s -> 14061.51s]  would probably be 18 dollars a week now a brewery okay so i guess that would be
[14061.51s -> 14065.66s]  probably 122 dollars a week no that's not good for me at the
[14065.66s -> 14076.54s]  moment tannery 220 dollars a week okay i think
[14076.54s -> 14083.70s]  it's going to be the tannery wine press uh batch will be
[14083.70s -> 14088.90s]  40 i guess that your profit will be negative 148 dollars a week well then
[14088.90s -> 14092.42s]  uh guild master gary that's not profit that's loss
[14092.42s -> 14098.68s]  so um no thanks your profit will be you owe me 150 dollars that there's no
[14098.68s -> 14110.04s]  profit an oil press 208 that's not bad
[14110.04s -> 14119.02s]  and iron works 42 dollars a week don't think so weavery and dye works
[14119.02s -> 14123.59s]  holy shit your profit will be 520 dollars a week
[14123.59s -> 14136.60s]  hold on so what about just what just a weavery
[14136.60s -> 14145.74s]  minus 50 dollars a week a weavery to make linen from flax
[14145.74s -> 14153.91s]  70 dollars no so that was crazy how much is that one okay so a weavery
[14153.91s -> 14158.60s]  and a dye works the land of the materials you right so
[14158.60s -> 14167.48s]  ten thousand dollars to start it and five hundred dollars a week after that
[14167.48s -> 14175.45s]  swindle the new king and then take the money somewhere else
[14175.45s -> 14178.73s]  just keep swindling people out of taxes and then
[14178.73s -> 14191.32s]  do tax evasion so much well it's not tax evasion that's just stealing money
[14191.32s -> 14206.20s]  okay oh right what if i just never come back what was i doing who was i looking
[14206.20s -> 14212.71s]  for oh right all right the king so where was
[14212.71s -> 14226.49s]  he he was like on the way he's on the way right he was going this way
[14226.49s -> 14233.38s]  he was gonna hang out somewhere over here where are you come on
[14233.38s -> 14253.18s]  all right only 100 okay that's the week is over are you in here or what
[14253.18s -> 14256.62s]  you've run into a trap you're attacked by a group of just me

[25851.61s -> 25854.25s]  nothing how was i supposed to know to do that
[25854.25s -> 25857.61s]  if i didn't have a chat of like 3000 4000 people here
[25857.61s -> 25861.45s]  how would i ever know to press x to use the lance why the fuck would i ever do

[25936.60s -> 25951.67s]  have some bits to go through the first part of gameplay for
[25951.67s -> 25958.49s]  mountain blade is just grinding for money to do anything fun
[25958.49s -> 25962.97s]  i don't i didn't i thought you'd i all right
[25962.97s -> 25993.61s]  i should have had the wiki page open over here on the left the whole time
[25994.17s -> 26008.70s]  just played it wrong well that's just what happened
[26008.70s -> 26012.86s]  all right if you enjoy mountain blade i'm glad you do
[26012.86s -> 26019.70s]  it's a very immersive interesting game i just i guess i guess i didn't know i
[26019.70s -> 26021.46s]  didn't i didn't know what i was getting into
[26021.46s -> 26025.21s]  i thought it was a different game and that's on me
[26025.21s -> 26043.06s]  so i'll see you guys tomorrow have a great night
[26043.06s -> 26051.38s]  and let's go back to the bits so at uh seven hours ago exactly we had
[26051.38s -> 26058.04s]  ten dollars from miss melon tea thank you miss melon tea
[26058.04s -> 26061.16s]  hey germans my first first bit donation ever recently i moved back
[26061.16s -> 26066.06s]  to my home country away uh from my fiance
[26066.06s -> 26069.98s]  uh who i won't be seeing for months i just want to say that both you and chad
[26069.98s -> 26072.54s]  have been keeping me great company through this tough time
[26072.54s -> 26082.89s]  and i cannot thank you all enough love you lots uh thank you so much miss melon
[26082.89s -> 26093.59s]  and hopefully you uh can see them soon it's a long time to wait but
[26093.59s -> 26114.70s]  glad to keep you company thank you uh let me i had let me see here hold on
[26114.70s -> 26125.66s]  i had to move this one second uh thank you some guy for the 20 bucks
[26125.66s -> 26128.62s]  no meme video or phantom of the opera tonight couldn't find anything so in
[26128.62s -> 26141.58s]  stages a picture of my dog really that's a that's a cute dog let's
[26141.58s -> 26162.65s]  take a look at that dog thank you so much for the 20 bucks what
[26162.65s -> 26191.16s]  kind of dog is that are you still here it's a pug
[26191.16s -> 26204.33s]  i don't think that's a pug don't let dickheads get you down
[26204.33s -> 26209.75s]  you know there's nothing to do with that but if you want if you want a real talk
[26209.75s -> 26215.51s]  here for a second sometimes like for instance trying to
[26215.51s -> 26220.23s]  play a game that is a huge learning curve that requires
[26220.23s -> 26223.35s]  potentially hundreds of hours to understand everything
[26223.35s -> 26227.99s]  and for every action from the first 10 seconds
[26227.99s -> 26233.90s]  of in the game to be called like stupid and that i'm doing something wrong can
[26233.90s -> 26246.17s]  get fairly aggravating it just it can from i don't know we
[26246.17s -> 26254.17s]  were joking around in the beginning but if i click on the map wrong if i if
[26254.17s -> 26265.51s]  i don't go to the right place in the first 10 seconds
[26265.51s -> 26270.02s]  like the the hyper like overdrive backseating
[26270.02s -> 26273.30s]  and i don't know which way is which i don't know which way is correct
[26273.30s -> 26277.14s]  um i got a blindfold on and people shouting orders
[26277.14s -> 26302.46s]  and sometimes people backseat to get me to go in the wrong direction it's like
[26302.46s -> 26305.58s]  fuck well if i went that way and it was wrong but everyone
[26305.58s -> 26320.95s]  you know what i'm saying backseating for eye spy won't be as bad
[26320.95s -> 26357.61s]  i don't i disagree but anyways just disable chat no absolutely not
[26375.66s -> 26378.54s]  imagine having a chatless stream it'd just be like
[26378.54s -> 26402.17s]  hey it's me just sitting here in my room not saying that that was like a huge
[26402.17s -> 26411.40s]  issue tonight but trying to learn a game like this
[26411.40s -> 26425.77s]  is already frustrating on its own it's been an issue lately though
[26425.77s -> 26451.00s]  especially this year yeah i i don't i mean maybe a little bit
[26451.00s -> 26454.68s]  to secretly learn the whole street game off stream and pretend you're just
[26454.68s -> 26489.27s]  a god gamer or don't put all your points into throwing weapons
[26489.27s -> 26493.13s]  yeah but but i'm talking about jokes aside right
[26493.13s -> 26497.11s]  and that is actually a viable thing am i wrong to say that
[26497.11s -> 26499.59s]  that eventually like if you get lances and stuff and you level that up that
[26499.59s -> 26506.50s]  that's not like that's actually viable later on
[26506.50s -> 26540.78s]  it is viable right it's very viable okay viable but not for you i but i think i
[26540.78s -> 26543.10s]  think sometimes there's like a big disconnect
[26543.10s -> 26549.54s]  between like you guys got to remember i have never played this game before
[26549.54s -> 26554.95s]  ever some of you might have hundreds of thousands of hours in this game i
[26554.95s -> 26556.63s]  literally have don't even know what it is
[26556.63s -> 26560.55s]  i was it was requested that i play it i have no fucking idea what the hell this
[26560.55s -> 26582.70s]  game is i'm glad you guys are enjoying yourselves
[26582.70s -> 26587.05s]  but you gotta remember i i'm so blind that i
[26587.05s -> 26612.06s]  don't know that doing something like that is i have to learn it right he
[26612.06s -> 26629.82s]  doesn't know the game is pretty complicated just play

[27227.21s -> 27230.73s]  you said i said it sucks as a joke though that was a joke i was just
[27230.73s -> 27244.46s]  making a joke anyways noctil it's a very fun game
[27244.46s -> 27247.59s]  i'm just probably not gonna play it again it's very like hard and
[27247.59s -> 27260.86s]  take complicated and maybe i'll install the star wars mod and like put it in
[27260.86s -> 27264.84s]  would you recommend it yeah i would i would it
[27264.84s -> 27270.33s]  there's okay there's a shitload of content obviously

[27275.75s -> 27279.26s]  hard hard to learn let's put it that way hard to understand
[27279.26s -> 27292.76s]  what's going on uh but thank you too mostly lost for the one dollar
[27292.76s -> 27296.44s]  chat gets mad at you for choosing easy mode but then also gets mad at you for
[27296.44s -> 27308.73s]  putting points into useless categories i don't get it
[27308.73s -> 27319.27s]  i don't see the contradiction well the contradiction is the game needs to be
[27319.27s -> 27325.43s]  potentially on easy for those builds to work early i guess
[27325.43s -> 27332.92s]  were people actually mad at easy mode no i just got i just got made fun of for
[27332.92s -> 27337.59s]  like 40 minutes until i changed it i shouldn't even open up the fucking
[27337.59s -> 27346.78s]  menu it was when we got to the c raiders and i
[27346.86s -> 27350.14s]  beat the c raiders with only losing like two people and it was like wait a minute
[27350.14s -> 27354.06s]  hold on a second what difficulty you play it on you
[27354.06s -> 27375.54s]  fucking monster make chat the weakest wrestler in the next germa rumble
[27375.54s -> 27379.27s]  uh i already did that i've done that before
[27379.27s -> 27383.51s]  and it came back to bite me because they did very well they eliminated like seven
[27383.51s -> 27406.82s]  people so i'm not sure i want to do that again
[27406.82s -> 27410.87s]  local streamer is peer pressured into having a bad time
[27410.95s -> 27415.34s]  i didn't have a bad time though i had a bad time
[27415.34s -> 27419.27s]  you know where it really started to unravel when i thought that when the king
[27419.27s -> 27423.74s]  killed me and i then when i turned into an archer
[27423.74s -> 27428.60s]  and shot my own guy in the back because they changed my colors that's
[27428.60s -> 27444.87s]  where it unraveled at about the five and a half hour mark
[27444.87s -> 27452.17s]  uh but thank you mostly lost so much thank you to uh a pepperoni for the
[27452.17s -> 27455.29s]  three dollars hey jeremy what's up love you and what you do buddy do you have a

[27515.32s -> 27521.08s]  for fourth graders like can i make it even more clear
[27521.08s -> 27535.14s]  you know what i'm saying god damn it just i'm leaning into that one

[27537.78s -> 27539.54s]  end of the stream hang out a lot of people just
[27539.54s -> 27541.94s]  kind of leave and they left with me being like fuck god

[28068.02s -> 28071.94s]  typical player's army there's also king harlow's buttery outlook
[28071.94s -> 28074.90s]  which is definitely woven into his characterization his personal philosophy
