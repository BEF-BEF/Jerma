[1.40s -> 7.74s]  Hey, what's up? Uh, dropping some frames here right in the beginning.
[9.59s -> 23.24s]  That's not a good sign. Stable now, I guess. Uh-oh. No, how you guys doing? What are we doing? Today,
[23.24s -> 28.84s]  we're gonna be doing something that's not the Nintendo vibe. I'm sorry. The vibe has not come
[28.84s -> 39.56s]  in completely yet. It'll all be here tomorrow, according to amazon.org, because I bought some
[39.56s -> 48.38s]  extra stuff. Uh, my room is not really... I can't just have the default vibe set up.
[49.02s -> 57.18s]  I had to get... fuck, we're dropping frames again. I had to get those stands, because
[57.18s -> 60.22s]  this room is not really... I can't really mount those things anywhere,
[61.18s -> 72.79s]  so I'm gonna have two stands that are in the corners pointing down, and they're not here.
[74.98s -> 80.52s]  On the ceiling? No, no. They're two, like, tripod stands that I have to screw those... um,
[80.52s -> 85.13s]  what are they called? The trackers? Not the trackers. They're like the little squares.
[85.13s -> 94.15s]  They're like boxes. I don't know what HTC calls them. Lighthouses, okay. Yeah.
[94.87s -> 102.65s]  But I'm excited. I'm excited to, like, VR my room for real, because the PSVR was fun,
[102.65s -> 107.08s]  but it was very... it was very limited. I had to, like, be sitting down. I had,
[107.08s -> 115.03s]  like, that small cord. I did have a lot of fun with PSVR, but I'm excited to kind of graduate
[115.75s -> 122.66s]  to the big boy machine, like, the vibe. The vibe looks better, it's more comfortable,
[122.66s -> 129.54s]  and it's more versatile, so I'm looking forward to it. So here's the plan. I got a new
[129.54s -> 136.34s]  schedule here for you. If we can stream today... I don't know why I'm dropping so many frames.
[136.98s -> 148.78s]  Let me make sure, like, nothing weird is going on here. I'm like, I got nothing going on.
[148.78s -> 156.54s]  Just kind of happens. But the plan is today... remember that species evolution game I was
[156.54s -> 161.86s]  talking about, like, a few days ago? Where you have to, like, make spore creatures, and they
[162.42s -> 169.98s]  eat each other, and mates, and they evolve? It looks really fun. It's called Species
[170.94s -> 186.68s]  Artificial Intelligence Real Evolution, I think. Oh, the second channel finally got to the
[186.68s -> 206.87s]  Boston to Vegas arc. Yes, it did. They're on a different timeline. Is this the game with the
[206.87s -> 211.19s]  annoying stock splash sound effect? No, no, no, no, no. This is not a... this is a PC game.
[211.19s -> 219.96s]  It's on Steam. There's just no... it's not a category on Twitch, so I can't... I can't even
[219.96s -> 233.10s]  change the category, because it's not on, like, the Twitch's directory or whatever. But we have a
[233.10s -> 240.52s]  kind of a different problem here, and that is... I guess it's one of those days where I'm going
[240.52s -> 245.83s]  to drop 10% of every frame. It's been, what, five minutes? That's why I'm kind of just sitting
[245.83s -> 255.74s]  here. I'm, like, waiting to see if this corrects itself. But... so I... let me get...
[255.90s -> 262.38s]  I gotta give you some information here. So the Vive did not come completely yet. I'm still
[262.38s -> 272.90s]  waiting on it. I am going to do the Vive stuff on Valentine's Day. So from Valentine's Day,
[272.90s -> 279.34s]  which is Thursday. So today is Tuesday. Yeah, so Thursday, Friday, Saturday is going to be the
[279.34s -> 288.01s]  Vive stuff, because tomorrow is my anniversary with Kim for two years. So we're going to go
[288.57s -> 293.53s]  have some fun. We're going to go do something. And so Valentine's Day, we're kind of doing,
[293.53s -> 298.62s]  like, a dual Valentine's Day thing here, where it's anniversary and Valentine's Day,
[298.62s -> 305.38s]  but it's not... not yet. That's where I'm going to be tomorrow. And I'm trying to
[305.38s -> 309.46s]  just swallow my anger right now. Like, as deeply into my stomach as I can.
[309.46s -> 321.64s]  I am, like, eating this anger. I am eating it. It's like it's a monster that keeps coming
[321.64s -> 328.81s]  out of my mouth and I keep chewing and swallowing back down. He's getting really angry at his
[328.81s -> 345.58s]  fucking anniversary. No. Just let it all out. No, it's not worth turning the stream off.
[346.38s -> 359.37s]  Try getting two ISPs at once. Somebody, like, pissed on the box or something, wherever it is.
[360.17s -> 366.78s]  How do you beat orphan across? There's a point where he goes
[369.83s -> 372.55s]  and you have to run away because he's going to make the whole place electricity.
[373.35s -> 380.66s]  Don't attack him when he does that. A lot of people just go in for the kill when he does
[380.66s -> 384.18s]  that and the whole place becomes electrified. You don't want to do that. That's how you get
[384.18s -> 400.09s]  yourself killed. All right, I'm going to attempt. I'm going to attempt here to open up the game.
[403.61s -> 411.03s]  But yes. Hey, look, there it is. Nothing tomorrow. Anniversary with my girlfriend.
[411.83s -> 415.11s]  And then we're going to do Thursday, Friday, Saturday with the Vive.
[416.07s -> 423.02s]  And then next week, I've got a PS3 game that I'm incredibly excited for.
[423.91s -> 427.99s]  It's a Safari game where you take pictures of animals. That's the whole game. It's not
[427.99s -> 440.66s]  Pokemon Snap. It's a PS3. It's called Africa with a K. I'm excited for it. But this game,
[440.66s -> 446.26s]  in particular, this is called Species Artificial Life Real Filler for Vive.
[447.22s -> 453.85s]  Is it what this one's called? No, no, no. I kid. This is going to be fun. This is going
[453.85s -> 462.39s]  to be cool. So how this works, I've kind of done a very basic look at this game.
[463.11s -> 469.22s]  You get a randomly generated seed, randomly generated world, and you have to essentially
[469.22s -> 478.54s]  watch and take care of and watch over slugs. These slugs then evolve over the course of
[478.54s -> 482.94s]  the game into anything. They mate with each other, they eat each other, and they can turn
[482.94s -> 488.10s]  into fucking anything. If you've seen the trailer of this game, I recommend you do,
[488.74s -> 498.36s]  because it looks wild. Yeah, that's how I feel right now. Yeah, that is the germ of Pluto
[498.36s -> 505.18s]  right there. That's how I feel right now with the internet being a piece of shit. That
[505.18s -> 512.73s]  actually does look like it. They could smell how they could just, I'm telling you, the
[512.73s -> 519.74s]  computers can hear this shit. But world style, we're going to just kind of do whatever
[519.74s -> 528.54s]  the defaults are for now. We might go a little deeper, but it's kind of been on the radar for
[528.54s -> 532.06s]  a little while since it came. It's an early access game, which I don't really like to play
[532.94s -> 538.50s]  early access games, especially on stream, because they could be void of content. There
[538.50s -> 541.93s]  could be like nothing here. That's why I don't really like to do them, but it looked
[541.93s -> 547.93s]  interesting enough where we could have a little bit of fun and it's freaking out.
[547.93s -> 558.39s]  It is, it is, it is. Why does my screen look like it's melting? It shouldn't. So I'm
[558.39s -> 567.62s]  going to have to save frequently. We're going to save frequently and get this gone.
[567.62s -> 575.74s]  Fucking internet, man. This is just like Happy Gilmore situation where like Bob Barker,
[575.74s -> 588.47s]  I'm just like, oh, why is the screen all red? Is it? Oh, actually I got to make a text
[588.47s -> 593.43s]  here. Hold on. Let me just text. I got to, let me text. I got to text somebody.
[593.43s -> 616.79s]  I'm going to give somebody a warning here. Texting in 2019. Now I'm, I'm giving,
[616.79s -> 621.35s]  I'm giving italics a warning because I think he was potentially starting his stream
[621.35s -> 624.31s]  in like a little bit here and it's like, well, I don't know. Be careful with that.
[627.59s -> 632.12s]  Texting and streaming. Yep. Sometimes. But all right, let's go. Let's just try. I can't sit
[632.12s -> 637.88s]  here and cry over spilt. Uh, I almost just said something that I would have regretted.
[639.40s -> 642.44s]  Uh, you could probably fill that in. I'm good. I think I'm getting better at that.
[643.24s -> 650.84s]  I'm getting better at that. Don't cry over spilled milk. Right. But I was going to say
[650.84s -> 655.86s]  cocks. Don't I've been, I've been getting very good at that. Just has to happen enough
[655.86s -> 673.35s]  times. All right. All right. So far I like it. Pretty good default. Oh God. This is a
[673.35s -> 685.74s]  little too loud. Didn't I turn the music down? I can't adjust it now. All right. So there we
[685.74s -> 705.45s]  go. There we go. So it starts out like this. We've got, all right. Okay. That's, that's
[705.45s -> 716.81s]  manageable. So new world. It's the same one we were just on. To me, this is not evolution
[716.81s -> 728.54s]  music. I'll be honest. This is like going down the tunnel in a third person driving crime game.
[729.62s -> 741.62s]  That is not Grand Theft Auto. All right. So I got controls to get time acceleration,
[741.62s -> 746.23s]  which is one, two, three. This is what I got to work with here. So everything starts off as
[746.23s -> 751.69s]  a slug. As you can see that everybody has like a Sims meter. So this is health,
[752.41s -> 758.17s]  this is food and this is stamina. Let's take a look and see where we want to go.
[760.95s -> 766.47s]  I think everybody starts off with the same thing and I get to choose kind of who mates with who.
[769.54s -> 774.34s]  The music just kind of abruptly stopped. That was a little odd, but okay. I think we're good.
[775.06s -> 785.86s]  That was really jarring. All right. So take a look. We got species. I can do, I think I can
[785.86s -> 794.54s]  like look at, there we go. Number of creatures, survival, not, I don't know. Age 60. How are they
[794.54s -> 801.51s]  aging this fast? I have it on like the, okay, there we go. Health capacity. Age out of 90. Why
[801.51s -> 807.99s]  do, how long do they live? It's cold blooded. 28 optimal temperature. What temperature is it
[807.99s -> 815.70s]  outside right now? Gluttony. Angry. He's about to die. Feed him quick. This is, I can feed
[815.70s -> 824.02s]  him. Food. All right. So food's going good. No, don't kill. When, when do they mate?
[824.74s -> 833.75s]  All right. Get these tutorials off the screen. There they are. What happens at 90? Do they
[833.75s -> 842.65s]  all just die? Physiology. Okay. This is just a few of the values defining physical structure.
[842.65s -> 847.85s]  So this shows how long the creature is before it dies. How tall it is, the volume, the mass,
[847.85s -> 856.50s]  the head scale. Good. We got a save point. Let's see overview. 62. They're very sleepy.
[857.06s -> 864.01s]  Anybody else like alive over here? I don't want to play with those guys. They're going to
[864.01s -> 873.27s]  die. What about these ones? Starving. Oh God. Okay. These are, these are,
[873.27s -> 885.50s]  I got to feed them. There we go. All right. So we're going to deal with these over here.
[885.50s -> 891.19s]  How do I make like food bins? Oh, you just can do it. How many times can I do this? How,
[892.23s -> 899.96s]  how many times can I do this? Okay. Cause this is their hunger meter and they know this is
[899.96s -> 907.10s]  stamina meter. Uh, 10 community subs just came in from whiff, whiff, sigh. Thank you.
[907.10s -> 912.28s]  Whiff, whiff, sigh. 10 community subs. Oh, whoa, this one's got bigger. This one got
[912.28s -> 921.42s]  bigger. What? How did this one get bigger? Oh, they, look, we have, okay, okay, okay.
[921.42s -> 925.11s]  But this is good. This is good. Forget about everybody else in the whole planet.
[925.11s -> 933.93s]  Sniff. Oh, hold on. They're multiplying. Omnivore. They eat grass. So what happens
[933.93s -> 948.23s]  when they run out of grass? Potato slugs. All right. Wait, wait, wait. I think we have,
[948.23s -> 956.38s]  no, they're just multiplying. Energy. Okay. So stamina, draining its stamina somehow.
[956.38s -> 961.10s]  I think they're just impregnating themselves. Yeah. They're like a single celled organism.
[962.33s -> 967.05s]  Genetics. A, C, G, T, T, T, G, T, T, T, G, G, G, G, G, T, T, T, T, T. I don't know what that
[967.05s -> 975.10s]  means. Uh, that's a placeholder. Okay. Okay. A more thorough explanation of the genetic
[975.10s -> 979.37s]  system will be implemented later today. It's a placeholder. Creature energy, health,
[979.37s -> 989.03s]  food, stamina. That sounds good. It's just a hash. It's everybody's password.
[991.08s -> 995.14s]  What happens when they come over to this species over here? Wait, they're all, they're
[995.14s -> 1000.89s]  all the same species, right? This one dying. We have to focus on like just the big ones,
[1000.89s -> 1012.57s]  I think. All right. Hold on. Genetic engineering. Oops. Uh, well, I killed that one.
[1012.57s -> 1025.43s]  Why would you have feed next to kill? Genetic engineering, draw bones, animation, skin type,
[1025.43s -> 1032.98s]  secondary saturation. All right, hold on. What about like a brain? This one's going
[1032.98s -> 1040.46s]  to have a brain. Gluttony. Oh, I can change how they, how they feel. Aggression.
[1042.74s -> 1055.91s]  Hold on. Head, neck length, neck, neck length. Oh no. All right. Let's not get too carried
[1055.91s -> 1067.32s]  away yet. We need to have, this has to be natural. No, I can't make them like a tether
[1067.32s -> 1086.78s]  ball. Not yet. Um, just five. That's fine. It's got to be natural. Head scale. You can
[1086.78s -> 1090.86s]  do anything you want, huh? But I need them to evolve into each other. So head type.
[1090.86s -> 1094.46s]  Ooh, I can add. All right. Definitely have to have the underbite. That's pretty,
[1094.46s -> 1108.42s]  I like the underbite. Yeah. Underbite. No, that, that doesn't look right. We have to
[1108.42s -> 1115.56s]  start easy. I don't want it just to go crazy. Okay. Number of features. Number of facial
[1115.56s -> 1131.06s]  features. Face. Uh-oh. Uh, what about, what if I drop this back down to where it was?
[1133.98s -> 1148.68s]  All right. Face. Feature type one. A horn. Texture. Size. Okay. We're gonna, there'll
[1148.68s -> 1154.66s]  be a horn. All right. The next thing I'm gonna, I'm gonna make Spider-Man, I think.
[1154.66s -> 1158.34s]  No, stop. Just do it normal. Do it regular. Not yet. It's been like 20 minutes.
[1159.22s -> 1170.07s]  There they go. He's got eyes. Just keep, we're going to do slug and slug. Okay.
[1171.74s -> 1179.38s]  Tail. Um, give him a tail too. Give him like a little, like sausage casing for a tail.
[1185.03s -> 1188.33s]  That's all right. It's like a little snake thing. I'm gonna make the neck a little
[1188.33s -> 1199.67s]  thicker too. Size. Maybe a little bigger. Okay. Limbs. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1199.67s -> 1202.87s]  We have to, we're going to go make another person over here and we're going to give them
[1202.87s -> 1217.78s]  arms. Uh, this is going to be called, gonna think of a good initial creature name. It's like
[1217.78s -> 1231.69s]  Slagonius, uh, Slagonius hornopolis. Whatever. Who gives a shit? This is our first creature.
[1232.65s -> 1233.37s]  The game crashed.
[1235.77s -> 1247.24s]  God damn it. When did it save? I had a creature made too. That sucks.
[1249.14s -> 1258.55s]  Where was it? It was too OP. No, it was this guy right here. All right, I can do it again.
[1260.23s -> 1278.25s]  Did it save it? There it is. Right there. We're good. Crashed again. Shit. God damn it.
[1278.25s -> 1293.05s]  Really? Is it too cursed? No, it can't be. Try it on somebody else. Export creature.
[1293.05s -> 1305.82s]  Slagonius hornopolis. Generate. Did it work? Is this, did it turn in? I don't see this. No,
[1305.82s -> 1312.52s]  this is, this is not it. That's not it, right? Are you going to evolve into that?
[1319.24s -> 1336.38s]  I don't, so I over writ. All right, hold on a second. Let's fucking do this one more time.
[1336.38s -> 1351.56s]  I overwrote it. All right. Well, let's, let's try this again. This has so much potential
[1351.56s -> 1356.57s]  if it worked. You understand? This is like, there's so many options. There's so much to do.
[1359.08s -> 1367.72s]  If I didn't crash the game five times in 10 minutes. All right, let's go with that. Let's
[1367.72s -> 1386.44s]  see if I can get it to work. That looks good. I'll give it a tail too. And a long tail. There
[1386.44s -> 1393.32s]  we go. All right. Generate. Slagonius hornopolis. It doesn't matter if it doesn't have a horn.
[1393.96s -> 1417.90s]  How about this one? Crashed again. Fuck. Hold on. Let me try something else here.
[1418.54s -> 1436.47s]  I'm going to like go to like a different version. I had like the new like update
[1436.47s -> 1446.22s]  and I'm going to just try to do it without that update. Let's try it again. Just do something
[1446.22s -> 1458.22s]  easy. Just make it like a fucking tube sock for all I care. Generate. Shlomo char. Who cares?
[1459.18s -> 1467.56s]  All right. It worked, right? Which one was it? It was this one right here, right?
[1472.98s -> 1480.39s]  I can't tell. Did it do anything? Oxygen. Needing, it needs oxygen. Are there too
[1480.39s -> 1489.59s]  many people? There's too many bugs. Speed up the time. All right, which one was it? It was
[1489.59s -> 1501.78s]  this one right here, right? Let me look at the genetics. Overview. Swim stamina. Why is it dying?
[1501.78s -> 1507.32s]  Why is this thing dying? What the fuck was that? Why did that just happen? Did you just kill it?
[1509.56s -> 1522.89s]  They were eating each other. You just killed my creation. When you got a creature selected,
[1522.89s -> 1532.65s]  you can see their state over there. People are just dying. What?
[1532.65s -> 1545.67s]  What? Genetics. Physiology. This is just like how hard and long it is. Energy. This is how
[1545.67s -> 1560.18s]  hungry it is. Species of a creature. Energy. I read these already. Creature genetics. This
[1560.18s -> 1566.52s]  is a base for it. Premium specimen is like the original list one here.
[1567.56s -> 1571.00s]  Gene editor. Design creatures by specifying their genetic values.
[1572.17s -> 1575.93s]  Synthetic genomes can be exported and used as target genomes in the nursery.
[1576.81s -> 1585.14s]  Okay, hold on. Where's the nursery? Nursery, nursery, nursery, nursery. All right. Welcome
[1585.14s -> 1589.54s]  to the nursery. Here you can experiment with artificial selection pressures. Drop in a creature
[1589.54s -> 1595.14s]  or two and then design or import a target genome with the gene editor. The nursery will
[1595.14s -> 1598.82s]  encourage creatures similar to the target to breed while humanely killing off the rest.
[1599.62s -> 1607.34s]  Drag a creature in here. Capture a creature with a move tool. Okay. Why are they on fire?
[1609.19s -> 1614.76s]  Why are they all burning? What? That's not the music you should be playing.
[1622.95s -> 1626.95s]  There are too many of them. We have to just find the one that's going to survive.
[1626.95s -> 1636.22s]  All right. It's definitely not these ones. Is everybody dead? No. There's a whole thriving
[1636.22s -> 1648.14s]  colony over here of burning insects. Drop the temperature? Cool it down. Why are they just
[1648.14s -> 1659.13s]  burning? Delicious meat. They've been burnt apparently. All right. I need to at least make
[1659.13s -> 1667.30s]  one monster. So here's the nursery. So, okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Where's the healthiest
[1667.30s -> 1676.84s]  one? All right. You look pretty healthy. Come here. Get over here. Welcome to the nursery.
[1676.84s -> 1679.72s]  Here you can experiment with the artificial light. Yeah, I know. I'm trying to grab
[1679.72s -> 1688.33s]  somebody. Okay. No, I don't want, I want the one underneath you. The one that's on fire.
[1691.22s -> 1698.28s]  It's too hot. All right. You look good. Come here. In nursery. All right. We'll get a drone
[1698.28s -> 1703.42s]  coming over here. I need another one. How are you doing? You're almost dead, but we'll,
[1703.42s -> 1708.34s]  we'll keep you alive a little longer. No, no. Stop breeding in the nursery.
[1709.43s -> 1714.17s]  Wait a minute. Where the fuck did you come from? How did you get that mouth?
[1715.91s -> 1721.42s]  What the fuck? Why? Why are they exploding? Why can they not live in here?
[1722.14s -> 1737.27s]  What? It's too hot. I made that mouth. Oh my God. Okay. Nursery. Applied radiation.
[1741.59s -> 1749.48s]  Edit target. Okay. Let's just go for, let's go for a long neck again.
[1751.77s -> 1757.19s]  I can't even see what it looks like, but whatever. Generate it. Everyone exploded.
[1757.19s -> 1769.75s]  And there's no sounds of the drones smashing into everybody. Is it still too hot?
[1770.63s -> 1781.88s]  Why do you want it at negative two? Now it's too cold and now it's too hot. I need land fertility.
[1784.94s -> 1787.98s]  Increase the fertility of the land. They need more. They've been eating too much.
[1794.86s -> 1803.99s]  We need oxygen. I told you we're looking into the petri dish. So we need more fertile land.
[1805.61s -> 1810.60s]  Increase water fertility. Look, we're just going to raise the water level. No, no, no,
[1810.60s -> 1816.95s]  lower the water level. That'll kill everybody. Okay. We'll, we'll do more land fertility.
[1816.95s -> 1829.85s]  They eat it as soon as it gets here. It's just overpopulation. I, I don't have any more.
[1829.85s -> 1835.48s]  All right. How do I get it? How do I do like a plague? They're breeding too fast.
[1835.48s -> 1841.10s]  And this is just one section of the island. All right. What about these? Look at these guys.
[1841.10s -> 1848.09s]  These guys look okay. Let's manually feed these guys. I'm going to get this. I'm going to
[1848.09s -> 1856.95s]  figure this out. Chode diagram. Rover. Allow you to drive rovers. Okay. Rovers. Add a rover.
[1858.10s -> 1866.09s]  All right. This is the fucking what I'm looking for here. Feed. Feed creatures with high stats
[1866.89s -> 1883.80s]  and big size. The fuck is this? Oh, no, no, no, no. High stats. Size. Drive. Go.
[1886.02s -> 1893.06s]  Okay. Let's make like fucking four of them. No. Kill population when there's a, when total
[1893.06s -> 1910.94s]  creatures are higher than 200. We got to start to mitigate some of this statistic. Okay. When
[1910.94s -> 1923.43s]  there's two, drive that around. Go. Feed the creatures with low hunger. Right. So somebody's
[1923.43s -> 1927.88s]  feeding them to keep them alive. And one of them is killing them when there's too many.
[1927.88s -> 1940.55s]  This is very counterproductive, I think. Feed for stomach high, stomach low. Stamina diet.
[1942.90s -> 1950.25s]  Reach mass. Armor. Insulation. HP. Energy. Energy low. Right. That's what we're looking
[1950.25s -> 1959.21s]  for. I got the wrong game listed because this game is not on Twitch.
[1960.31s -> 1966.23s]  I cannot make this game a selectable game in the, in the directory. So it's diagonal with closest
[1966.23s -> 1978.36s]  damn thing I could. All right. Low energy. Go. What the fuck? Hold on. I have to drive this
[1978.36s -> 1988.86s]  thing? It's already dead. How do you feed? I have to, why wouldn't I just use my mouse?
[1998.39s -> 2000.95s]  Don't damage them. They're very expensive. All right. Well, get me out of this.
[2001.51s -> 2009.86s]  Let them do it on their own. Okay. So we've got a lot of issues. Okay. Yeah, they don't
[2009.86s -> 2013.70s]  have to do it. They're good. They're good. They're good. They're good. See the killing and
[2013.70s -> 2026.01s]  come on. I need to see that from a different angle. Details and stats. How do I get out of
[2026.01s -> 2040.68s]  the fucking rover? I got to get out of the rover. Diagram nursery rovers ecosystem mode.
[2040.68s -> 2054.70s]  Okay. There we go. Species selection mode. Creature selection mode. How do I get the
[2054.70s -> 2061.69s]  fuck out of the rover? Toggle indirect. Okay. Toggle camera mode. What the fuck?
[2062.87s -> 2071.99s]  All right. We're good. Showing thoughts. All right. So now I got a rover blasting around,
[2071.99s -> 2081.05s]  feeding and killing. How are we doing over here? This, this thing is murdering everybody.
[2085.32s -> 2092.22s]  This doesn't seem correct. Maybe I should just put this one on. No. Okay. I need to put this
[2092.22s -> 2096.14s]  one on feed because this one is killing them before they even have a chance. No. Stop that.
[2096.14s -> 2103.66s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. How do I control you? Stop. Which one is killing?
[2103.66s -> 2114.33s]  No. Feed. When creature count. No, no, no, no. Feed trees with low energy. Feed trees.
[2115.58s -> 2121.18s]  Do it. All right. They're not going to be killing them anymore. I need to, I want to make
[2121.18s -> 2127.45s]  something. How are you doing? This one looks healthy. What about in the nursery? Well,
[2127.45s -> 2134.95s]  wait a minute. We got, we got a mutation here. This one's bigger. This one's really big.
[2135.59s -> 2147.05s]  Why the fuck did it just die? Keep this one alive. How's it doing? Fatigue needs sleep.
[2147.05s -> 2163.10s]  How you doing on temperature? Build a fence. Place a climate control. This can be used to heat,
[2163.10s -> 2185.37s]  cool. All right. Fuck this. What's wrong with that fence? I need to keep one person alive.
[2190.02s -> 2200.20s]  Okay. And a climate control device. Temperature. Target value of zero. In here. Create it.
[2201.78s -> 2210.57s]  All right. Now, fertility. Target value of, um, I don't know. That's fine. Does
[2210.57s -> 2215.77s]  a guy get an ecosystem in here? Now it's time for a germ or rumble. No, it's time for like a,
[2215.77s -> 2222.58s]  I need one person to live so I can turn them into, how are we ever going to make Spider-Man?
[2222.58s -> 2231.78s]  That's never going to happen. This much pollution. Uh, three fertility. They're both
[2231.78s -> 2243.67s]  fertility. Do I have to like change that? Are they both fertility now? Look at all this
[2243.67s -> 2246.55s]  fucking pollution. Look. Okay. This. Look at it. Look at it. We got like a, we got
[2246.55s -> 2249.99s]  like a cookie monster here. All right. Feed them. Feed them. How do I feed? Get off. Out.
[2249.99s -> 2262.89s]  Out. Come here. All right. You're, you're in the fence. Good. We have two cookie monsters.
[2262.89s -> 2268.12s]  Why are you dead? Why did you just eat him? The baby just ate the adult. The baby just ate
[2268.12s -> 2278.98s]  the fucking adult. And now I got to keep these guys alive. More fertility. Why are you eating
[2278.98s -> 2285.64s]  each other? I don't understand. Okay. Now let's go to genetic engineering. You eat him
[2285.64s -> 2288.98s]  and I'm fucking going to throw you in the river. Don't even look at me like that. Did
[2288.98s -> 2295.77s]  you just look? Do you know what you were doing? Needs oxygen. How do I increase the
[2295.77s -> 2303.67s]  oxygen? Artificially inseminate the selected creature with save DNA from another creature.
[2303.67s -> 2315.53s]  You got it. Don't crash. We're going with long neck? No, the one with the legs.
[2315.53s -> 2337.83s]  Target number to import. Ready? Did it work? I don't think it worked. Let's do times two
[2337.83s -> 2348.87s]  speed. It's got legs. A species has split into two species. This happens naturally. Wait.
[2348.87s -> 2353.96s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. A species has split into two species. This happens
[2353.96s -> 2357.72s]  naturally when there are no longer any members of either population that can breed with
[2357.72s -> 2367.96s]  members of the other. One of your wild species encompasses a lot of biodiversity. Being part
[2367.96s -> 2371.80s]  of the same species doesn't necessarily mean two creatures are capable of breeding.
[2371.80s -> 2377.40s]  Rather, it means that they are connected by a chain creature that can. When creatures at
[2377.40s -> 2380.84s]  either end of the chain are genetically incompatible, the species is known as a
[2380.84s -> 2390.14s]  ring species. Okay. Well, I didn't do that though. I gave him legs and I gave him a
[2390.14s -> 2402.50s]  tail instead. I need to increase the fertility here. The dying target value of. Oh my God.
[2402.50s -> 2416.79s]  We used to. Why are you doing this? Uh, 10. What? No. What? Temperature? No. Of 10. Fertility.
[2416.79s -> 2425.78s]  That's good. Whatever. What? I'm so confused. Let him out. Let him out. Okay. Okay. We got
[2425.78s -> 2436.63s]  a first mutation. Well, what's going on over here? No one has evolved. They just got green.
[2437.35s -> 2442.63s]  That's all that happened. It's because they've been eating too much grass.
[2443.74s -> 2450.92s]  What a mutation. This is the equivalent of when you eat too many carrots.
[2451.56s -> 2457.18s]  It's just a bunch of fucking mouse turds. All right. How do I go from mouse turd to Spider-Man?
[2461.00s -> 2470.89s]  No. Okay. I'm going to release them. You ready? They're free. Go. Keep an eye on this one.
[2475.98s -> 2482.87s]  This one's got legs. This one's got legs. Feed this one. He's cold. They're cold. They're
[2482.87s -> 2490.97s]  cold. They're a little cold. I'm going to sneeze. I fucking couldn't get it. Whatever.
[2490.97s -> 2495.61s]  Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Oh, this one's got a neck. Okay. We're starting
[2495.61s -> 2505.46s]  to get necks. A species has lost. A species has been lost forever. Extinction is a fact of
[2505.46s -> 2509.62s]  life. In the long term, only a very small percentage of species will survive. Even for
[2509.62s -> 2516.18s]  those lucky few, survival is often a phyric victory. The chances that their descendants will
[2516.18s -> 2525.85s]  even resemble them are slim at best. What species was eradicated?
[2528.90s -> 2532.68s]  We need to keep the ones alive that are... Not the... Okay. The ones that are eating each
[2532.68s -> 2540.57s]  other. Here's a good leg curve with the frog right here. Damn it. That's why you need to
[2540.57s -> 2547.43s]  keep them in a pen because you can't control what's going on. I need an overview here. Hold
[2547.43s -> 2562.44s]  on. Give me like a... Give me like a fucking... That's a chart. Head scale. Genetics. No.
[2562.44s -> 2573.75s]  Species. What about over here? Yeah, these are all part of the same species. What are
[2573.75s -> 2578.31s]  they doing over here? Are they developing into something else? No. Because I haven't been
[2578.31s -> 2586.79s]  fucking with them over there. All right. Where the hell? Where am I? I have no idea.
[2587.35s -> 2601.06s]  What the fuck was I? Can I like a quick go to this person? Here it is. All right.
[2601.06s -> 2605.22s]  What about the nursery? I need to have like fucking... What we got? We got a new color
[2605.22s -> 2613.22s]  scheme here? Oh, all right. All right. Genetic engineering. Let's... I need to make something.
[2619.40s -> 2630.41s]  We got the watermelon creature. Let's go with... Let's go with torso. Hold on. Torso.
[2634.18s -> 2646.94s]  Chest height. I need to start making people with legs. Otherwise, they're going to keep
[2646.94s -> 2665.74s]  going like this forever. Okay. The head has to be higher. Where do we go? We're going to
[2665.74s -> 2680.39s]  make like a praying mantis. The head needs to change. Give it a neck. Hold on. Let's get
[2680.39s -> 2691.16s]  the claws, stingers. Limb step size. That's how big it is. Limb 11. Okay. Limb type. Let's see.
[2694.46s -> 2701.91s]  Oh, shit. Okay. Hold on. Here we go. There we go. I'm going to name this one the boxer.
[2707.94s -> 2726.49s]  Length. No, no, no. Wrong, wrong, wrong. It's this one. Too much. Too much. Too much.
[2727.13s -> 2744.68s]  I'm making a silent hill monster. We need some like shoes. I don't know which one this is.
[2748.04s -> 2768.38s]  Oh, God. Okay. Limb tip. Here we go. It needs to have shoes. Barbecue shoes? Limb tip. I need
[2768.38s -> 2782.04s]  to make a different... Limb tip. Oops. Oh, yeah. For sure. I got to get rid of the...
[2782.04s -> 2793.58s]  This looks awful. Limb... What's it? Limb 21? Limb 21's got to go. That's better. All
[2793.58s -> 2798.42s]  right. So this is going to be called... We just need to... We got to throw some weird shit in
[2798.42s -> 2821.22s]  here. We got to get this going. Generate. This one's going to be called... Okay. Where
[2821.22s -> 2828.41s]  is my shoes of rocket? Right here, right? So we're in the nursery. So let's go to the nursery.
[2829.77s -> 2843.77s]  And we're going to apply this. Select target. Target is shoes of rocket. Import. Okay. There
[2843.77s -> 2849.93s]  it is. Let's see if it happens. Apply radiation. Apply like fucking three times radiation.
[2851.94s -> 2867.13s]  Okay. That's good. Is it dead? Is that one dead? That one's dead. Is it? Are these... Okay. Why
[2867.13s -> 2881.69s]  are they just exploding? Where's my Sims meter? They're suffocating. Get some oxygen in here.
[2882.33s -> 2887.99s]  How do I get oxygen inside of here? What the fuck are the rovers even doing?
[2888.63s -> 2897.35s]  Where's my rovers? Feed creatures with high size. Feed... It's all feed. They're feeding them.
[2897.91s -> 2919.29s]  They're not killing them. Not supposed to be. Feed the trees. How do I get more trees? Wait
[2919.29s -> 2923.27s]  a minute. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[2923.27s -> 2930.92s]  Freeze time. Nursery. Got it. Right there. Get the radiation down. Target is selected.
[2931.66s -> 2943.75s]  Go for it. You need to survive. This one's coming out. Come on. What the fuck? What is happening?
[2943.75s -> 2950.98s]  Why do you keep blowing up into... They come out and explode. I didn't give them explosion. Okay.
[2950.98s -> 2960.25s]  They got feet though. They do have feet. Need oxygen. How the fuck do I get oxygen in here?
[2960.25s -> 2972.54s]  How do I get more trees in here? All right. I'm getting you out of here. Need more
[2972.54s -> 2991.85s]  fertility. You guys all right? Everybody like... No, he's just dying.
[2994.31s -> 3006.20s]  They keep coming out and they keep fucking instantly dying. Cold bask in sun. Walk to
[3006.20s -> 3018.28s]  location. Feed the trees. Look at all these trees have maximum energy. There's like plenty
[3018.28s -> 3034.71s]  of trees in here. Look at all the energy they have. Max energy. Max energy. Max energy. All
[3034.71s -> 3043.11s]  right. I'm getting you out of here. Time to get to the real world. Oxygen. Oxygen. We need more
[3043.11s -> 3055.34s]  fertility. It's too cold. He's drowning himself in water. No. Stop drowning. Why are you
[3055.34s -> 3065.02s]  drowning yourself? Get out of there. No. Why? What are you doing? Why are you doing that?
[3065.58s -> 3081.24s]  He wants out of the simulation. I took him out. Instantly just instantly goes into the water
[3081.24s -> 3090.86s]  to die. Oxygen. Seeking oxygen. What am I missing here? Hold on. Genetics. Energy.
[3092.52s -> 3105.24s]  Excess pregnancy. Okay. Diet is an omnivore. Luke warm blooded. Optimal temperature
[3105.96s -> 3119.61s]  is 24. It's aerobic. Okay. I've yet to have a meaningful evolution except for I just
[3119.61s -> 3128.65s]  they're just that's why they explode when they have babies. Is that what it is? Are they
[3128.65s -> 3152.14s]  having are they getting too pregnant? I'm just gonna ultra fast forward. Uh oh. Sorry about
[3152.14s -> 3163.74s]  that lag. It's apologizing for the lag. It's very CPU intensive. Do we have anybody else
[3163.74s -> 3172.63s]  that's like mutating correctly? I need to put a species cap. I think it was his own
[3172.63s -> 3176.07s]  the default. Like okay should I make like a new world and all right here's what we're
[3176.07s -> 3185.72s]  gonna do. This is gonna take like 40 in-game days to get what I want. There are just
[3185.72s -> 3190.94s]  two yeah there are too many rabid shits. This thing doesn't even have a head. Oh yeah
[3190.94s -> 3201.45s]  it does. Set okay hold on somebody's gotta set all the mutation settings in the world
[3201.45s -> 3208.04s]  creation menu to maximum if you want actual results. Oh okay. Well that was a fun interesting
[3208.04s -> 3216.81s]  like how does this game work. Let's try it again. Number of creatures. Uh let's go with like a
[3216.81s -> 3231.06s]  a hundred? Fifty. What's the maximum that I should have? Fifty? Okay mutation rate. What is
[3231.06s -> 3234.90s]  the maximum? This mutation rate is high enough to completely obscure the effects of natural
[3234.90s -> 3246.34s]  selection. Offspring may not resemble the parents at all. Three. God damn it. It's like
[3246.34s -> 3258.42s]  being at the gas station. A high mutation result in a lot of genetic drift. Okay breeding
[3258.42s -> 3264.28s]  range. The maximum genetic distance a creature can be from another creature while still allowing
[3264.28s -> 3279.50s]  them to mate. Put this a little higher then right? Like 40? 50? Automatic population control is on.
[3280.38s -> 3293.53s]  Okay anyone can just mate with anyone right? Tree growth rate. Yeah we want I want more of
[3293.53s -> 3302.26s]  these fucking things. Forest density. A little bit more density. Temperature sensitivity. Fertility
[3302.26s -> 3310.92s]  sensitivity. Speed multiplier. This is fine. Damaging rate is one. Temperature loss.
[3311.64s -> 3320.25s]  I think these are fine. So we got much better temperature noise map. Temperature average.
[3323.06s -> 3331.38s]  Fertility average. Should I make this higher? Yeah I got like way more vegetation and shit.
[3335.56s -> 3344.74s]  Lower the creature cap even more to what like 20? 25? What if they die?
[3345.38s -> 3365.72s]  You're making an ice world? Max efficiency. I think this is okay. Oh okay wait wait wait wait wait
[3365.72s -> 3378.87s]  wait I see what you're saying. Creature cap is at 3200. Yeah that's a lot. How about like 100?
[3379.51s -> 3389.62s]  200? 3200. How many starting creatures are on the map? Let's go with like 10
[3393.64s -> 3400.76s]  and let's have like 500 are allowed. World size that's fine. Get 10 starting creatures.
[3400.76s -> 3408.92s]  I'm ready to get my shit together. This looks good all right. Turn off the tutorial messages.
[3408.92s -> 3426.33s]  I don't think I need them anymore. Max fertility. 350. Starting creatures.
[3428.42s -> 3439.11s]  We have a choice here. Predator and prey. Aquatic. Random. Or blank. So is it going to be
[3439.11s -> 3456.49s]  random shit? Oh my god. I mean do I really want to work with random? Not yet. Not yet.
[3456.97s -> 3463.26s]  Let me just try doing it with like me really trying. That's gonna make fucking all kinds
[3463.26s -> 3472.41s]  of fucked up characters. We'll do that later. I need to try to make my own creature. So what
[3472.41s -> 3483.02s]  was the last thing? Breeding range. Lower it a little bit to like what 20? God damn it.
[3483.02s -> 3486.46s]  Whatever. 1999 is what you pay in like the steam store for 80 percent of all the games
[3486.46s -> 3492.97s]  anyways. All right let's go. You ready? Higher mutation. We'll get there gradually.
[3493.96s -> 3507.54s]  Here we go. So where are this 10? Here they are. Already they're like already already
[3507.54s -> 3520.26s]  dying in the ocean. I got three. Where are the other ones? Did they spawn in a random place?
[3520.26s -> 3525.42s]  Fuck them. Who cares? We're gonna these we'll have here we go. Seeking oxygen.
[3526.73s -> 3536.98s]  Well get out of the fucking water then. You can feed them all like that. Where are the
[3536.98s -> 3556.36s]  other ones? Is there? All right found one. Get over here. Okay we got sleeping. It's a little
[3556.36s -> 3561.77s]  too hot. Wants to go swimming. Wants to go swimming. Oh they're getting bigger. What
[3561.77s -> 3566.09s]  about the ones over here? All of you get like in the same spot. There's too many of you already.
[3569.99s -> 3587.00s]  They're already breeding in extreme levels. Temperature up a little. Where are they going?
[3587.00s -> 3598.98s]  All right so let's try. Let's get some of you. That's because the fertility rate.
[3600.10s -> 3602.90s]  They're just going to overpopulate this immediately.
[3603.30s -> 3616.39s]  Okay just let them do whatever they're gonna do. Seeking oxygen. Seeking oxygen. Seeking oxygen.
[3616.39s -> 3626.33s]  They've already ruined the earth here. It's just a virus. All right get in here.
[3628.62s -> 3632.81s]  Let's make some stuff happen in here. At least the truth. All right no no this is
[3632.81s -> 3639.03s]  just ridiculous. Hold on. I gotta do this one more time. New world. Fertility rate. Oh my
[3639.03s -> 3657.86s]  god. I picked that slug up. Put it in the den and 15 babies came out. Wait this is fertility of the
[3658.50s -> 3674.38s]  the land isn't it? Variation. Let's keep it at one. This is vegetation. Breeding range.
[3675.61s -> 3687.70s]  Ecosystem modifiers. World size. Creature detail. 0.05 will not work. Mutation rate
[3687.70s -> 3695.77s]  up. Oh they can make it so they have to be sexual to reproduce. So they're reproducing
[3695.77s -> 3715.51s]  just on their own. Okay so they're self reproducing. So now we have 10. They have to mate
[3716.31s -> 3724.44s]  to do anything at all. This is going to keep the numbers low. We brought the fertility down.
[3725.96s -> 3739.02s]  Tree efficiency can stay on. Mutation rate is good. All right let's try it again. Good luck.
[3739.58s -> 3753.75s]  They have to have sex. I'm looking for one. I have 10 here. I should just have two. Where are
[3753.75s -> 3765.99s]  they? Okay they're... this one's eating. All right that's good. What are they? What's wrong
[3765.99s -> 3775.85s]  with you? Armornus? Armornus. What does armornus mean? Cold basking in the sun.
[3777.37s -> 3794.97s]  Okay the tropical rainforest. Looking for others. There are others but where are they?
[3795.13s -> 3813.21s]  Okay. How are you guys doing over here? Okay. Somebody already had sex. No don't do that.
[3815.21s -> 3818.25s]  Okay so you exploded and out came. No no don't just...
[3823.72s -> 3835.29s]  Well you are having a lot of children over here. Much more than over here.
[3837.85s -> 3841.21s]  All right let's try to make something happen. We could just watch.
[3846.95s -> 3853.82s]  No let's get somebody. Come here. You. Get inside of the nursery. Wherever the hell it is.
[3854.38s -> 3867.94s]  Come here. Get over here. You. Genetic engineering. I'm gonna make something. We're
[3867.94s -> 3883.94s]  gonna have to be a target. Make it bigger. Like maybe like a three. Five maybe. Let's make
[3883.94s -> 3891.29s]  it a different color. That didn't really work. Okay what about? No that's not doing anything.
[3893.93s -> 3898.17s]  Whoa. Okay we're gonna have like a caterpillar. Caterpillar fuzz. That looks good.
[3906.97s -> 3920.36s]  Optimal temperature. Just like fucking one. Torso. Chest height. All right now I'm gonna get...
[3920.36s -> 3944.94s]  I'm gonna make something. I'm gonna make stingray. Or a broom. No I'm not...
[3946.22s -> 3952.57s]  That doesn't look right. Stomach. I gotta make it wider. It's disgusting. Well it's not done.
[3958.02s -> 3964.18s]  It's grotesque. Well it's part of the evolutionary process. Length of pregnancy.
[3964.18s -> 3973.21s]  That's fine. Litter size. That's fine. Positive values are carnivores. It's gonna eat things.
[3973.93s -> 3983.19s]  Torso rotation. Oh yeah that's what I'm talking about. Okay hip height. Stomach width. Limbs.
[3984.07s -> 4007.75s]  All right I gotta change those. Looks good. Limb ending type. What's the thing from Half
[4007.83s -> 4015.59s]  Life? I'm gonna make those things from the greetings to you and what the guys that do
[4015.59s -> 4028.46s]  magic powers. The Vortigaunts. Yeah I'm gonna make the Half Life to like magic power monsters.
[4029.26s -> 4040.22s]  Okay this would be a little thicker. Triceps are a little bigger. Biceps are a little bigger.
[4041.02s -> 4046.31s]  All right Lim 11. Let's go. Why is Lim 11? It's a weird name for it.
[4047.03s -> 4074.15s]  I changed my mind. I'm gonna make General Grievous now. Which one was more grievous?
[4080.22s -> 4088.18s]  28. No. That looks no. It's like an elephant. The first one I had was pretty grievous.
[4090.95s -> 4106.65s]  That's kind of grievous. Make it a little longer. Okay it's gonna be more upright though.
[4108.97s -> 4120.92s]  Rotation. Where's the rotation there? Torso right. Torso rotation. Oops okay.
[4122.79s -> 4133.69s]  Uh that's this is the legs now. Yeah this is the forest giant boss.
[4134.33s -> 4170.78s]  Check this out. Watch this. Oh no never mind. Shit. How do I get back to? I need to rotate
[4170.78s -> 4199.34s]  these. I need to rotate these. Please stop. Burn the computer. Just wait. Hold on. Holy fuck
[4199.34s -> 4216.18s]  that looks horrible. Oh all right I like that. That's not bad. Neck. Has a neck. Neck length.
[4216.18s -> 4236.50s]  Where's this neck? You guys see a neck here? Uh oh this is the limbs. Oh it's fucking with me.
[4239.99s -> 4256.30s]  I clicked on neck. Neck. Okay there we go. Neck length has neck. I think it's just one. Yeah
[4256.30s -> 4263.62s]  okay I need to make the thickness of the neck bigger. Stop making it do that.
[4263.62s -> 4280.58s]  Okay neck slope. Are you guys gonna hate this? It's just one of those snakes. The
[4280.58s -> 4298.41s]  fireworks snakes. All right bring it down. Even more. Even more. Even more. Okay so it's
[4298.41s -> 4321.13s]  like that. Good. It uses his neck as another limb. Looks good. Head. Head scale. You can just make
[4321.13s -> 4330.42s]  a giant ball. Head type. I feel like there are actual bugs and shit in the world that look like
[4330.42s -> 4341.91s]  this. That one's horrifying. Look at the eyes. That's eyes and mouth. Yep. Pretty great dead
[4341.91s -> 4353.98s]  space character you got here. Brain. Uh let's see. Sex drive. Climate sensitivity. No you find
[4353.98s -> 4361.77s]  empathy. Reduces the chance. Yeah like give it some empathy here. Risk taking. High risk,
[4361.77s -> 4371.59s]  high reward food sources. Okay laziness. Aggression. No it's not a coward. It's not
[4371.59s -> 4377.96s]  that aggressive. It's not that lazy. It's not that gluttonous. Okay number of features. Facial
[4377.96s -> 4387.77s]  features. We got a couple here right? Let's go two. Feature one. Which one is it though?
[4392.09s -> 4397.22s]  Feature. What is it looking at here? Feature size. Feature type two. I think it's just not
[4397.22s -> 4410.58s]  big enough. Holy shit. Okay it's got a giant hat on. Okay well it's wearing a shell on its head.
[4411.30s -> 4430.15s]  Make it very aggressive and very lazy. Why is it all these weird shells? It's got a birthday
[4430.15s -> 4444.42s]  hat on. All right it's gonna wear a birthday hat. Okay. Face. That's good. I think this
[4444.42s -> 4463.59s]  is a good a good start. It'll mutate into something else. Generate. Did it work? I can't
[4463.59s -> 4489.06s]  tell. That's never gonna successfully exist. Did it not do anything? I don't get it. We're in the
[4489.06s -> 4495.38s]  nursery right? There it is. Okay so it's going from here. It's trying. It's looking like it's
[4495.38s -> 4507.53s]  trying. It's gonna make this like weird crab birthday monster. Okay go back. So the question
[4507.53s -> 4515.03s]  is. I need to. No get out of here. Can I like feed? All right hold on we got another
[4515.03s -> 4525.70s]  mutation going on. The drones are killing the ones that are not genetically similar.
[4525.70s -> 4533.74s]  That seems kind of unfair. I just want the crab birthday monster to come up. All right.
[4534.62s -> 4553.26s]  No. It's just killing them if it's not correct. It's just browsing. All right I'm gonna
[4553.90s -> 4566.12s]  turn off the royalty-free YouTube tutorial music. I don't. That's not my decision.
[4567.34s -> 4573.14s]  Like come on. Somebody grow. All right well you keep doing that. Well I go check out the
[4573.14s -> 4588.20s]  other people in the wild here. How are they doing? Is anybody even alive? Okay. How are we
[4588.20s -> 4600.23s]  doing? We have a couple of changes it looks like. They've started to change color and
[4600.23s -> 4611.67s]  have little tails and little legs. The population's getting too high. All right.
[4611.67s -> 4626.36s]  Can I please get like a mutation going? Nuke the island. Come on. Somebody evolve.
[4627.00s -> 4641.75s]  Sleep. Seeking oxygen. Eating. Corpse. Premium species has gone extinct.
[4641.75s -> 4647.11s]  Has gone extinct. Have they gone extinct? Premium egesium has gone extinct.
[4648.49s -> 4661.22s]  Lucarius specimen has mutated. Oh the drone's killing the ones that are mutating. Let me
[4661.22s -> 4665.80s]  just take that. I don't have any. I don't think they are. I think they're like controlling
[4665.80s -> 4697.43s]  the population. Evolve. Dammit. Evolve. One of you will evolve. I have a better idea.
[4712.31s -> 4752.26s]  Evolve. Rude. What do you mean rude? What the fuck? Web of life. Where the fuck are these people?
[4752.26s -> 4764.15s]  What? How did you guys do all this without me? Hold on a minute. These they're like progressing.
[4764.15s -> 4775.83s]  They got hands. They got mouths. They have weird little eyes. Feed them. Feed them all.
[4776.97s -> 4785.03s]  So hold on. So I can see where it's gonna go. What about these weird ones? What's this one?
[4785.75s -> 4802.25s]  Oh shit. They are. They're just like skating around. Oh no. It wants to go swimming. It's
[4802.25s -> 4813.86s]  gonna die. Well it's extinct. Don't feed them. So where does that web end up? Go down here.
[4813.86s -> 4821.54s]  We've got major species partially player owned. Minor species. All right. You're still going.
[4822.79s -> 4834.49s]  My controlled environment's not doing well. Cold. All right. Let's kick up the temperature.
[4834.49s -> 4845.93s]  That's so cool though. What the fuck is that? Where is that? All right. Right there.
[4849.67s -> 4860.89s]  It's rapidly exhausted. It's a hairy arm. Let's think from all real monsters.
[4862.47s -> 4875.82s]  Apply radiation. Oh god. Okay. What the hell? All right. I'm gonna do radiation. Times like
[4875.82s -> 4891.77s]  2.3. This is dopey fuck. Look at how much fun this one's having. They swim upside down.
[4891.77s -> 4907.40s]  I love this one. I hope this one never dies. Where are you going? It wants to walk to location
[4907.40s -> 4918.39s]  over here. To like hang out by the tree. And now it wants to go swimming again. Looks like a
[4918.39s -> 4923.06s]  tongue. Yeah it does. All right. Hold on. We got more species shit going on. Look. Look at
[4923.06s -> 4928.87s]  this one. Look at this one. You just gotta let it happen. Right? Oh god. This is extinct.
[4929.43s -> 4933.51s]  This is. Okay. Like the brown rabbit turd is now extinct. So that's kind of good.
[4934.23s -> 4949.48s]  Here we are. Any others? Yep. We got plenty over here. Well that one's coming up. So how
[4949.48s -> 4959.90s]  am I going to introduce mine into the world? My stupid tripod monster. Have you still not
[4959.90s -> 4972.87s]  evolved yet? You asshole. Hurry up and evolve. All right. We need to make it a little warmer.
[4979.90s -> 4983.42s]  Turn off the drones. I can't. I don't have any like that are here.
[4984.30s -> 4987.82s]  Unless I can like turn them off in the nursery. I think they just do their thing, right?
[4994.82s -> 5001.82s]  Increase radiation. These ones are not. Why? Come on. How come they get like cool ones and I
[5001.82s -> 5006.04s]  don't get cool ones. Oh shit. They're burning. They're burning. They're burning. They're burning.
[5006.04s -> 5010.65s]  They're burning. They're burning. Oh fuck. The whole place is burning. This one just evolved.
[5011.29s -> 5021.26s]  This is involved into like a like a crusty booger. It's. Turn it down. Temperature down.
[5021.26s -> 5035.67s]  Down. Down. No. Stop it. Down. Oh for the love of god. I'm fucking torching everybody.
[5041.10s -> 5051.35s]  It was fine. Well this stupid dumb ones in the nursery were like it's cold. So I literally
[5051.35s -> 5058.94s]  started killing everyone on earth to appease like six people in the nursery. All right. We're
[5058.94s -> 5067.91s]  down to 20. Everyone's fine now. 40 degrees Celsius. 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Yeah. I know.
[5067.91s -> 5072.71s]  But I was appeasing. You know what? Why don't I just fucking put you in here? Here. Give me
[5072.71s -> 5100.30s]  the cow. God damn it. Speed this up. Go on. No. What the fuck are you doing? I hate this
[5100.30s -> 5110.95s]  thing. And now it's extinct. And we still haven't evolved at all. This control group
[5110.95s -> 5121.85s]  doesn't have any water. How? Should I like put a fertility box in here? Or like an oxygen box?
[5122.57s -> 5130.95s]  These guys haven't done anything. They're killing the ones that are not mutations.
[5136.06s -> 5144.28s]  Get a drone to kill the drones. I have to raise the radiation in the nursery again.
[5145.00s -> 5162.10s]  Oh god. Is that going to be bad? Come on. Give me the fun music.
[5162.10s -> 5167.75s]  Get them out of the nursery. All right. I'm gonna take like I'm gonna take this one
[5168.47s -> 5172.06s]  and put it out of the nursery. This is the control group over here.
[5177.38s -> 5184.94s]  Right here. Come on out. All right. This is the control group. It's been radiated.
[5190.41s -> 5201.00s]  This is like patient zero right here. Uh oh. Are we gonna infect everybody? No. You just
[5201.00s -> 5208.18s]  died in the water. Well a couple of kids just went out into the open. Oh boy. Here it
[5208.18s -> 5224.49s]  begins. They they come they're gonna infect everybody now. There they are. How many more
[5224.49s -> 5231.78s]  generations need to pass? There's so many texts. Yeah somebody's blowing my phone up right now.
[5237.53s -> 5241.29s]  We got some weird looking motherfuckers right now because look it. That's what the target was
[5241.29s -> 5246.44s]  right? With the long uh arms in the front. What about over here? How's the nursery doing?
[5249.94s -> 5262.39s]  You still haven't got it. Not ready yet. I wonder if they're gonna start walking upright.
[5262.39s -> 5274.95s]  That's what I'm waiting for. The nursery is killing all mutations. Wait why is it doing
[5274.95s -> 5300.02s]  that? Fuck it. Let's introduce more. Get in there. Good luck. The nursery preserves a species.
[5301.19s -> 5306.76s]  All right well okay but if isn't this what it's supposed to be making?
[5308.60s -> 5312.04s]  Ten creatures in nursery. Edit the target right? The target is this.
[5313.50s -> 5326.66s]  Isn't that the point? It's the purity zone. Nursery. This is not the nursery here.
[5329.72s -> 5349.29s]  It will only spare the mutations. Just blast them. Well I brought I dropped some over here.
[5349.29s -> 5354.90s]  I think we're gonna start to see some interesting things now. They're starting to get legs.
[5355.70s -> 5362.70s]  Do they fight? They're starting to turn to crabs.
[5367.62s -> 5384.60s]  This one's doing like the stand like a handstand. Nice hand standing dog. Well
[5384.60s -> 5398.50s]  there we go. We're gonna follow this one. Herbivore starving. Holy shit what's going on
[5398.50s -> 5417.08s]  over here? Is that where I am? Are these are they have friends? Yeah it's an unpeeled
[5417.08s -> 5433.77s]  potato. Hunger. Browsing. It's just browsing around. This one's fucked up too. Hot desert.
[5433.77s -> 5440.30s]  How you doing? How much oxygen? Well stop doing that. Get out of there. What's wrong with you?
[5441.10s -> 5446.57s]  Why would you bury your head in the water for no reason? I need oxygen. I might as well put
[5446.57s -> 5456.63s]  my head in the water. I want to see what comes out of this one. It's just basking in the
[5456.63s -> 5467.43s]  sun. Oh hold on. I don't know if he peed on him or if this is him basking in the sun.
[5467.91s -> 5482.09s]  I'm not entirely sure. Look at this guy. Hunger. Scanning. He's gonna eat this one.
[5482.09s -> 5495.38s]  They're gonna get so fucked up. I do. This is my favorite. What's this one called? Primarius
[5495.38s -> 5510.41s]  anemurk. Oh no not as interesting as this guy. They're eating from the same tree. I'm gonna
[5510.41s -> 5517.82s]  pull out here in a second. Bring him to a new island so he can take it over. Yeah that's a
[5517.82s -> 5523.98s]  good idea. All right uh but how do you produce? Pause it here. I need to see this.
[5524.70s -> 5534.60s]  This is primarius anemurk. Statistics. Physiology. Hold on. Averages. It's an herbivore.
[5535.32s -> 5547.19s]  Does it need to have sex to survive though? Well I think we got we already got that.
[5547.19s -> 5550.63s]  We got all right. These two. No we're gonna get it. We have to bring two together.
[5553.34s -> 5560.36s]  Age 2000 out of 70. Okay well it's a capable warm-blooded optimal temperature.
[5560.36s -> 5566.06s]  Optimal internal temperature. Hairy. It's a decent it's a decent animal.
[5567.58s -> 5572.02s]  Okay let's go. Litter size one. We're gonna get you to a secluded place.
[5573.82s -> 5577.90s]  You can just you can keep living your life for a minute but who do we combine them with?
[5577.90s -> 5585.61s]  I need to be the okay you need to I need to be able to pay attention to you. Come with me.
[5586.41s -> 5592.66s]  I need to secure the secluded part. This is pretty secluded.
[5594.90s -> 5601.61s]  Down here. Make sure you're fed. Just bask in the sun for a little bit. All right you're
[5601.61s -> 5614.68s]  down there. Now who the hell do we combine you with? They're all binding of Isaac faces.
[5615.24s -> 5624.09s]  It's like I just walked into the secret room. This one's kind of cool.
[5624.09s -> 5633.86s]  I wish I could get a good look. Are you that green? Look at how green this is.
[5634.50s -> 5659.42s]  Is this the mate? I think it's green. Yeah green boy. Come with me. Where the
[5659.42s -> 5672.06s]  fuck did I put him? Over here right? Right here. All right you two you ready? Now play nice.
[5672.78s -> 5702.87s]  You're doing good. A little bit uncomfortable but it's okay. Now you go over here. Stop
[5702.87s -> 5711.27s]  resting. Come here. Come over and like enjoy this person that's on the island with you.
[5711.27s -> 5719.27s]  They'll figure it out. It's not the same species so it's too cold for them.
[5721.27s -> 5731.56s]  All right come on. Scanning. This is eating. They aren't the same species. They won't reproduce.
