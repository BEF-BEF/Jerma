[1.21s -> 8.34s]  I'm actually seeing a few people do say Kurt Russell. Fortunately Kurt Russell is not in
[8.34s -> 20.65s]  this game, but hello. This is a sequel to The Thing. And wait, I didn't even tell you what
[20.65s -> 25.99s]  we're doing. I didn't even make a tweet. I'm not supposed to be here. I'm not supposed to be here.
[26.95s -> 106.30s]  But let the intro play for like 30 seconds. Okay. Hi everybody. Today we're going to play The Thing.
[108.79s -> 116.18s]  In quotes, The Thing, the actual game, The Thing. This is a sequel to the movie. If you've ever
[116.18s -> 132.39s]  seen the movie, it's a good one. It's a movie about deceit, movie about who is it, who did it.
[134.28s -> 140.86s]  Without spoilers for a movie in the 80s. Oh right, they've remade this game, this movie.
[141.42s -> 148.46s]  I forgot about that. They did do a full remake of The Thing a few years ago, didn't they?
[152.70s -> 159.19s]  It was a prequel, unfortunately. Really? Was it not good? What does it have on Rotten Tomatoes?
[161.75s -> 173.91s]  Thing? What? 2016? What? 2009? 2011? Oh, not very good at all. This is 35% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[175.43s -> 182.44s]  Six on IMDB and... so this is not that good. Okay. Well, whatever. Forget about this one.
[185.98s -> 193.34s]  If you get a six on IMDB, I don't know. Usually a seven to 7.5 is every movie.
[195.45s -> 203.66s]  If you're not every movie, then you know, it's horrible. IGN gave it a 10 out of 10. They did
[203.66s -> 212.01s]  not. What kind of boomer uses IMDB? I mean, it's just, it was listed on the... IMDB was listed there.
[212.81s -> 220.41s]  It had some scary scenes. But we're gonna play the game. Oh, okay. This is weird because... so
[221.13s -> 226.89s]  this game is the sequel to the movie. And I believe it is canon. This is a canon game.
[230.84s -> 242.06s]  So, right? That's not incorrect. This game's also trash. Well, that's for you to say and for me to
[242.06s -> 246.86s]  find out. Because what if I love this game? I might like it. I might really like this game.
[249.06s -> 258.66s]  It's a third person shooter, scary, fun game. But yeah, that's what we're doing today.
[259.30s -> 268.10s]  It's trash. It's a trash. You don't even know that. You didn't even know what the thing was
[268.10s -> 275.53s]  until we just talked about it for 10 minutes. You haven't even seen the movie. Raise your hand if
[275.53s -> 288.89s]  you've seen the movie. I bet you half if you haven't even seen it. Here it is. Are we gonna
[288.89s -> 299.99s]  get a recap? We might get a recap, so this would be good. You guys ready? I am. Quiet during the
[299.99s -> 315.70s]  cutscene. Oh, okay. Normal, auto-aiming, hard, normal, or easy? No, this is a game from like
[315.70s -> 323.32s]  1998. I'm not doing hard. I'm doing normal. Always normal. Always normal.
[324.66s -> 333.82s]  Jeremy, the game is insanely hard. Okay, then I'm doing normal. No, I wanna be...
[336.14s -> 343.61s]  It's not the same. It's not what you guys think. This isn't like it is now, where there's like six
[343.61s -> 351.13s]  difficulties and the first four of them are easy. No, this is back in the day when hard meant
[351.13s -> 371.48s]  actually hard. You motherfuckers. Are these subtitles? Was this subtitles? Could I put subtitles on?
[371.48s -> 408.84s]  What is going on? That's not me laughing. I know it sounds like it, but it's not.
[412.52s -> 424.81s]  I gotta turn subtitles on and the game's on fucking hard. What the hell? This is not gonna be fun.
[428.01s -> 431.38s]  What do you see? David Hayter?
[432.42s -> 437.74s]  Have you found it? Your transmitter's down and everything else is foobar.
[438.54s -> 444.06s]  What do you mean? The base is gone, Colonel. It looks like massive explosives damage.
[444.86s -> 448.14s]  Any clues here are gonna be like finding a needle in a haystack. Are we sure?
[449.58s -> 454.14s]  Understood. Do a recon, see if you can find anything that'll give us an idea what happened.
[454.14s -> 459.72s]  I could try to get the chopper back to you within an hour, but visibility's not very good.
[460.52s -> 468.52s]  Okay, we'll make a sweep and report back. Roger. Check it out. Check up on Alpha Team or Blake.
[470.20s -> 474.84s]  Are we jumping out of the helicopter in the air? Okay, no. I was like we don't-
[474.84s -> 479.19s]  Keep your team together and get them to shelter as quickly as you can.
[479.19s -> 484.47s]  Roger that. Blake out. Okay. The snow is pretty-
[485.35s -> 489.37s]  All right, as you play through the first four levels, text pop-ups like this one will come
[489.37s -> 494.09s]  on screen from time to time to explain different parts of the game to you you can skip them by
[494.09s -> 498.49s]  pressing the escape button or turn them off entirely by pressing the escape button to bring
[498.49s -> 507.93s]  up the pause menu okay so i don't want to skip it and then selecting options you can then switch
[507.93s -> 513.21s]  the tutorials off by entering the game settings menu however they will teach you how to play the
[513.21s -> 518.41s]  game so it's suggested that you read each tutorial at least once more help and advice can be found in
[518.41s -> 524.09s]  the field manual you can find the field manual in the pause menu by pressing the escape button
[525.30s -> 530.42s]  something to note about this game that you guys need to know you can soft lock yourself in this
[530.42s -> 538.34s]  game you there are people that if you kill them you could ruin the whole game so i've been told
[538.34s -> 544.55s]  to pay attention because you're gonna fuck up the whole game is what i've been told good all right
[544.55s -> 549.83s]  cold exposure it's 40 degrees below zero in the anarktic and so whenever you're outside you'll
[549.83s -> 555.27s]  suffer from the cold an exposure meter it's a blue meter at the bottom of the screen will show
[555.27s -> 559.83s]  you how much time you have until temperatures begin to actually harm you and take away from
[559.83s -> 566.71s]  your health so i have a meter at the bottom that when the meter is depleted that's when i take like
[566.71s -> 575.10s]  dock damage okay as you play the game you will be given objectives these appear in the top left
[575.10s -> 580.78s]  hand corner of the screen and are color coded green text shows that an objective is still active
[581.34s -> 586.78s]  an orange text means an objective has been completed you can check the status of all of
[586.78s -> 592.54s]  your objectives by pressing the f button to enter the keys documents and objectives menu
[593.26s -> 598.86s]  once in this screen move the mouse up to highlight the document icon and then press the enter button
[598.86s -> 606.28s]  to view your objectives so f all right so green means it's what you're currently on orange is
[606.28s -> 612.12s]  completed retrieve evidence and rescue any survivors keep the team alive so this is my
[612.12s -> 621.62s]  team all right hold on we're that's cold let me i gotta turn on game settings tutorials on auto
[621.62s -> 632.25s]  aiming hard i'm so glad i can change that okay is there a audio video no advanced controls
[632.81s -> 644.55s]  there are no subtitles you guys are gonna have to pay attention no there are no subtitles in
[644.55s -> 655.00s]  this whole game good luck here we go okay retrieve what was it so we have to explode

[720.57s -> 728.20s]  camouflage is soldier engineer trusty cap and medics like to keep a warm keep warm in a beanie

[745.22s -> 751.62s]  alive they blink they fidget when they are bored and they think for themselves be careful how
[751.62s -> 758.18s]  you treat them as they are all trained veterans even if they are unarmed they won't hesitate to
[758.18s -> 763.30s]  take you down if they decide you are acting suspiciously they will also communicate with
[763.30s -> 770.49s]  you both verbally and with the use of icons that appear over their heads for an explanation of the
[770.49s -> 776.52s]  overhead icons refer to your field manual okay you guys didn't think that this was going to be a
[776.60s -> 783.43s]  fucked up game well let's wrap in as has already been explained your squad mates are intelligent
[783.43s -> 787.83s]  people and they will react to your actions based on how much they trust you when you enter the
[787.83s -> 792.39s]  squad menu you will see a bar above the names of each squad member that shows their current level
[792.39s -> 800.33s]  of trust for any squad member if his level of trust is in the green section it means he trusts
[800.33s -> 805.21s]  you and will take orders and help you throughout your mission if his level of trust is in the
[805.21s -> 810.41s]  orange section it means he doesn't trust you and he won't help you but he isn't yet convinced
[810.41s -> 815.93s]  you're an enemy so he won't attack you either if his level of trust is in the red section it
[815.93s -> 825.18s]  means he doesn't trust you at all and sees you as an enemy okay so green is good yellow is
[825.18s -> 833.72s]  cautious and red is i'm going to kill you where's the field manual oh yeah commanding your squad

[894.33s -> 901.24s]  what they mean i this is important this is important this is important this is important
[901.24s -> 908.50s]  i'm going to read this because i need to know so this is the trust and fear icons my trust has
[908.50s -> 917.29s]  gone from high to low my trust has gone from low to zero my trust has gone from low to enemy level
[917.37s -> 924.60s]  one my trust has gone from low to enemy level two my trust has gone from low to enemy level three
[924.60s -> 928.97s]  what does that does that mean like i'm going to throw a grenade in the room what's the different
[928.97s -> 937.53s]  enemy levels so at enemy level three i now see the player as an enemy and then going the other way
[937.53s -> 943.27s]  too so we have to build trust with everybody here so my trust has gone from high to buddy
[943.91s -> 952.66s]  my trust has gone from buddy to high all right so this we this is what we're looking for trust
[953.94s -> 960.50s]  my fear has gone from danger to crack up level two my fear has gone from danger to crack up level
[960.50s -> 970.73s]  three all right i think i'm starting to understand i'm talking enemy spotted i'm losing health
[973.43s -> 980.78s]  i am in i am i am in man down trust synopsis if your squad members don't trust you they won't do
[980.78s -> 993.40s]  anything for you got it all right how do we how do you save the game oh shit this is an old game
[995.78s -> 1001.93s]  junction boxes whenever you see the hand icon it means that you can do something by pressing the
[1001.93s -> 1006.89s]  e button yeah okay right the junction boxes in front of you is a basic one when you walk up to
[1006.89s -> 1012.84s]  it yeah i know you press e to open stuff okay when you walk right up to it a message will be
[1012.84s -> 1015.72s]  in the center of the screen to tell you the name of the junction box you will also see a picture
[1015.72s -> 1019.40s]  of a hand and a yellow bar at the bottom of the screen this tells you that you can fix this

[1069.45s -> 1074.49s]  of your squad is in this state it's only a matter of time until they die unless they're healed
[1074.49s -> 1078.73s]  bring your medic within close proximity to the injured person and he will automatically heal
[1078.73s -> 1083.78s]  them the medics you meet throughout the game can heal any member of your squad with the exception
[1083.78s -> 1088.42s]  of themselves so you will need to keep an eye on your medic's health and heal him yourself
[1088.42s -> 1101.29s]  when he is injured so heal me how many of those do you have all right what is this gun

[1818.09s -> 1836.34s]  out and move on this is key there's the key why is it so quiet i don't like how quiet it is
[1837.22s -> 1853.35s]  where's our other guy where's our other guy where's the other guy uh the other guy's the thing
[1853.99s -> 1864.22s]  i knew i should have shot that guy in the beginning what are you doing out here why
[1864.22s -> 1879.77s]  didn't you come in with us huh okay keep your eye on the medic supplies over here i'm gonna hide
[1879.77s -> 1896.39s]  this tape when i'm finished is that kurt russell for you think it rips through your clothes when
[1896.39s -> 1902.46s]  it takes you over windows found some shredded long johns but the name tag was missing they could be
[1902.46s -> 1924.18s]  anybody else i can do just wait rj mccready helicopter pilot u.s outpost north 31 movie
[1928.82s -> 1945.98s]  yeah remember when everyone lied about seeing the original movie i know you did now that's
[1945.98s -> 1955.72s]  offensive to me i love the thing i'm glad you did it's a great movie remember when no one knows
[1955.72s -> 1968.86s]  what a cassette tape is all right gain access to the infirmary completed uh what is that uh-oh
[1969.82s -> 1977.14s]  here take some bullets maybe that'll make you like me again the virus has the ability to replicate
[1977.14s -> 1983.27s]  the original biological entity including the clothing could be anybody it's so dark in here
[1983.27s -> 1987.83s]  do i don't have any light please don't tell me that i'm a fucking idiot and i'm gonna play
[1987.83s -> 2012.39s]  this whole game without a flashlight and it's like t power supply advanced junction boxes
[2014.81s -> 2019.53s]  in front of you is an advanced junction box and can only be fixed by your engineer
[2019.53s -> 2024.81s]  i've paraphrased to get your engineer to fix an advanced junction box you need to first identify
[2024.81s -> 2030.01s]  the junction box by walking up to it until its name appears as you would for a basic junction box
[2030.89s -> 2036.25s]  there are two ways that you can ask your engineer to fix it first if your engineer is close enough
[2036.25s -> 2041.77s]  to the junction box the i can fix it icon will appear automatically over his head this allows
[2041.77s -> 2047.21s]  you to walk right up to him and then press e which tells him to fix the junction box the second way
[2047.21s -> 2052.57s]  to have your engineer fix the junction box is to bring up the squad menu by pressing q select your
[2052.57s -> 2059.93s]  engineer then select the go-to option and lastly select the junction box you want him to fix he
[2059.93s -> 2078.68s]  will then go fix it can you fix this go fix it medic with the gun just looks like he's never
[2078.68s -> 2088.57s]  held one before it's freaking me out but you're holding that like a golden eye npc and that's not
[2088.57s -> 2101.78s]  how it works okay so we're going to go through here access codes the door in front of you is
[2101.78s -> 2107.38s]  the access code door and you'll need an access code for it to open access codes can be found
[2107.38s -> 2113.38s]  written down and as part of a computer terminal message or you'll find it somehow you do not have
[2113.38s -> 2119.94s]  to make a note of these codes as blake can remember them why can't i remember them why is it my trouble
[2119.94s -> 2126.66s]  with that what why do one of my squad members have to do this when you found the access code
[2126.66s -> 2131.80s]  for a door go up to the access panel next to the door and press e look for the access code to this
[2131.80s -> 2136.92s]  door and return when you found it hint access codes are usually just a series of numbers and
[2136.92s -> 2148.01s]  may not be obviously labeled an infected entity has the ability to fragment and survive every part
[2148.09s -> 2154.17s]  of it as a whole why the oh the lights just turned back on right all right
[2155.37s -> 2162.44s]  oh christ what is that you didn't see that i we chill out everybody keep tight till we figure out
[2162.44s -> 2173.16s]  what's going on that is a late reaction uh-oh your squad members are always conscious of their
[2173.16s -> 2178.36s]  circumstances and the environment around them and when they've seen too much they will begin to lose
[2178.36s -> 2184.12s]  it to see how a squad member is handling his situation activate the squad venue if press the
[2184.12s -> 2189.40s]  q button and pay attention to his picture if he's doing okay he'll casually be looking from left to
[2189.40s -> 2194.92s]  right if he's noticeably frightened he'll be looking all around at a panicked speed if he's
[2194.92s -> 2201.40s]  close to outright losing it and cracking up he'll be shaking uncontrollably to reduce your squad
[2201.40s -> 2207.56s]  members fear try giving him a weapon or get him to follow you out of the area refer to your field
[2207.56s -> 2211.72s]  manual to find out about different things you can do to calm your squad members when fear gets them
[2211.72s -> 2220.82s]  why would i give him a weapon are you good i mean i gave you a weapon but you're not doing
[2220.82s -> 2235.70s]  all right you follow me come here follow me go to how do i say follow me just come over here
[2236.79s -> 2249.22s]  follow me over here you come over here and just stay over here okay stay don't move there we go
[2249.22s -> 2258.94s]  see i did just fine i've compiled a five page report from the autopsy performed on the
[2259.50s -> 2264.70s]  anomalous corpse that was discovered at the norwegian outpost it appears that what we are
[2264.70s -> 2268.86s]  dealing with is some kind of self-repairing entity that has the ability to morph itself
[2268.86s -> 2279.38s]  into different biological forms access to medical supplies is limited to myself and garry code one
[2279.38s -> 2288.18s]  one three eight that's the kind of information willy was talking about i gotta find that report
[2288.18s -> 2305.19s]  okay one one three eight junction box i can do this actually you know what yeah you do it
[2305.19s -> 2333.29s]  we're friends okay saving the game oh oh it's only in specific save points oh that sucks it's like
[2333.29s -> 2338.97s]  resident evil thankfully i can do it as many times as i want oh medical bags where's the medic

[3128.42s -> 3137.35s]  he's found something might be research affirmative did he say if there were any hostiles in the area
[3137.35s -> 3145.27s]  negative no hostiles okay i'm on it wake up this is like jack nicholson snake it's not the regular
[3145.27s -> 3149.99s]  snake okay light poles exist to guide people from one location to another when blizzards hamper
[3149.99s -> 3155.35s]  visibility use them to help you discover new areas but don't be afraid to explore beyond them

[3282.82s -> 3288.82s]  like two different cutscenes if you were a squad member is injured and no medic is available you
[3288.82s -> 3295.06s]  do have the ability to heal him on your own using medical kits they'll indicate their need for help
[3295.06s -> 3299.70s]  by showing the i need health icon over their head when and when this is visible you can
[3299.70s -> 3303.38s]  automatically use a medical kit on the injured squad member by approaching him and pressing
[3304.26s -> 3310.26s]  alternatively if if you can equip a medic if you equip a medical kit you can heal an mpc by
[3310.26s -> 3319.91s]  approaching him yeah yeah yeah yeah just put it on your bar and mouse two cares i get it to see how
[3319.91s -> 3323.83s]  much health the squad member has at any time activate the squad menu at the bottom of this
[3323.83s -> 3329.27s]  particular panel is a red meter the fullness of it tells you how much health he has it's also
[3329.27s -> 3333.83s]  important to know that your squad members are in manned down state when they're down and bleeding
[3333.83s -> 3337.51s]  move quickly to heal them when they're in this condition or they'll eventually bleed to death
[3338.63s -> 3350.63s]  i don't do i have any health packs okay i do have a health pack let's do it i want to just
[3350.63s -> 3355.93s]  get this right since right mouse button carter isn't sure if he trusts you and he won't cooperate

[3363.51s -> 3369.91s]  squad member menu by pressing q and highlight carter and press enter now highlight the command
[3369.91s -> 3376.42s]  give to squad member and move the okay give to sc i know you have now given carter a weapon look

[3387.54s -> 3394.09s]  just gonna i'm not gonna read this out loud like reading comprehension if you just get you know
[3394.09s -> 3397.93s]  there's a study that says if you read something out loud you're not comprehending it completely
[3397.93s -> 3405.06s]  have you heard that study it's real that's why when you go through around and you're in
[3405.06s -> 3410.18s]  your high school class and you all read six sentences of the fucking novel you're currently

[4131.26s -> 4137.14s]  area killing thing beasts as you have already experienced the very small thing beasts can
[4137.14s -> 4142.74s]  easily be dealt with using normal weaponry however any other form of the thing requires a two-stage
[4142.82s -> 4149.51s]  attack firstly you will need to use normal weapons to reduce its health the thing's health is shown
[4150.15s -> 4157.90s]  by the color of the auto aiming target with red representing the lowest level of health once the
[4157.90s -> 4164.14s]  thing beast is on minimal health move in with a flame thrower to finish it off only fire can
[4164.14s -> 4169.66s]  actually kill these thing beasts so make sure to look out for incendiary weapons and keep a good
[4169.74s -> 4201.27s]  stock on you at all times well all i have is a flashlight weapon case something there we go

[4276.49s -> 4285.18s]  console oh oh what's that incendiary i wish i could seriously just switch quickly instead of
[4285.18s -> 4293.16s]  having to go to the fucking menu to do this all right what is over here what are these these
[4293.16s -> 4301.42s]  grenades weapon case oh yeah i'll be the flamethrower guy i just figured it out i'm

[4317.40s -> 4320.60s]  attack and then when it gets to be the time where i can burn it i will burn it
[4322.87s -> 4341.24s]  all right let's go oh here they come get them i like being the overlord i don't have any more
[4341.24s -> 4352.90s]  ammo okay actually i do i'm the ammo box yes if you need ammo tell me i'm playing support

[4360.44s -> 4370.14s]  think so hold on get in here and recalibrate where's the save point no all right just
[4371.56s -> 4379.61s]  it's my bar that matters so do i go back here no all right and go this way i'm gonna save it again
[4380.17s -> 4391.16s]  we've got flamethrower bang left or i can go that way too let's go over here first
[4397.58s -> 4410.86s]  does it easy can i not turn that on can you fix this fuse thing what's this electricity
[4413.58s -> 4443.48s]  um did i burn the boxes how do we get over here what can i do like you go to boxes maybe i just
[4443.48s -> 4453.26s]  can't do anything i don't know or you can give me your gun for a second can you i can't tell you

[4528.12s -> 4537.69s]  cool all right open it's right in front of you there's a door all right this is where we this
[4537.69s -> 4550.76s]  is where we actually figure out if we're capable of doing it like this save point right here no i
[4550.76s -> 4559.02s]  can't even touch it hold it pierce it's blake it's okay put your weapon down no way you're
[4559.10s -> 4564.46s]  infected just like well he just killed all of us i'm not your word ain't shit captain i found a
[4564.46s -> 4569.34s]  report that says the only way to prove you're not one of those things is through a blood test
[4569.34s -> 4573.98s]  now there's a medical kit near the kennel you go get it and come back here and i'll watch you do
[4573.98s -> 4599.62s]  the test oh just like in the movie he shot they shoot they're shooting him well turned out he
[4599.62s -> 4611.45s]  wasn't the thing just needed to see that's so funny they were just like nobody was even talking
[4611.45s -> 4617.62s]  either they're just like i guess i guess we're just gonna shoot them i guess so all right we
[4617.62s -> 4625.45s]  have to go to the medical tent go get the blood test these are grenades okay anything else in
[4625.45s -> 4636.70s]  here what's this a key that looks good save it one more time no soft locking right don't get
[4636.70s -> 4649.80s]  soft locked all right we need to go find the blood tests in the medical tent which i haven't gone
[4649.80s -> 4658.78s]  this way if you kill everybody you're gonna kill the thing yeah but if i kill everybody then i
[4658.78s -> 4681.37s]  lose this is i like this it's working out pretty well so far oh easy was there a health pack that's
[4681.37s -> 4691.54s]  it this well i guess this is shelter technically all right let's go blood all right we're looking
[4691.54s -> 4703.03s]  for medical supplies something's gonna jump around a fucking corner an engineer come here
[4703.67s -> 4713.66s]  don't get it okay break the boxes what the fuck just happened he's puking boy boy what
[4715.88s -> 4738.07s]  shoot him oh no everybody all right come here i can heal you uh how many health packs do i have
[4738.71s -> 4751.16s]  so that came out of this guy's mouth how are we all doing get in here open this everybody get in
[4751.16s -> 4762.09s]  here two shotgun shells ammo give me a pistol why can then why is there no pistol here
[4763.35s -> 4777.08s]  all right ammo wise though how you doing give ammo do you got two clips so you got two out of 20
[4777.64s -> 4788.74s]  so then you have one you only have five you've got one clip left take this take them both i think
[4788.74s -> 4796.79s]  there's a little bit more over here too is there i got so much pistol ammo all right what about
[4797.19s -> 4813.59s]  health you could use a heal let me just equip it heal them both we're good that was fucked up
[4813.59s -> 4830.28s]  back to the flashlight all right let's do it just stay here come on you can do better than that
[4830.92s -> 4841.30s]  i just like went in the building that's it area looks good all right uh this way
[4849.56s -> 4855.51s]  nice i just i want a pistol or something something small so i can contribute
[4869.06s -> 4876.57s]  blood tests the blood test hypo you recently picked up is specifically designed to expose
[4876.57s -> 4881.77s]  the virus entity when it exists in a human host you can use these to make sure a squad member is
[4881.77s -> 4886.89s]  really human and also to prove to your squad that you're not infected to boost their trust
[4887.53s -> 4893.05s]  to use a blood test hypo on a squad member simply equip it then approach him and press mouse two
[4894.17s -> 4897.85s]  yeah you so you do that and if they're an alien then they freak out and they turn into an alien
[4898.33s -> 4905.93s]  use on them where we're about to uh be tactical about using blood tests
[4905.93s -> 4914.84s]  they're a rare item and you won't find many yeah so this is where it gets interesting
[4916.76s -> 4924.26s]  nice you guys did it good work this is how you really play the game on hard don't you think
[4926.22s -> 4935.74s]  you guys are all right everyone's happy but i need to we need to open boxes um all right you've had
[4935.74s -> 4940.76s]  i've had give me your gun i don't care anymore give me all of it yes sir
[4947.58s -> 4958.55s]  there's nothing even in here what are you guys is this the legend of zelda shit or is anything
[4958.55s -> 4975.11s]  actually even in here i need a place to go in right now this is not it's am i just wasting ammo
[4977.19s -> 4982.33s]  i'm wasting ammo there's nothing there's never anything in these no way i've just proved it
[4982.89s -> 5003.42s]  it is a waste of ammo wasting ammo omega lull tactical i don't have any ammo for you just

[5029.05s -> 5042.92s]  and then it was over here all right here we go let's do the blood test
[5045.14s -> 5054.44s]  i'm gonna prove hi you give me the finger you got the kid good the report said the hypo
[5054.44s -> 5061.16s]  contains a chemical that reacts with blood do it we'll soon know one way or another now i'm

[5378.78s -> 5384.70s]  attacking me and i started chasing him and i lost him in the storm what about williams i lost him too

[5625.82s -> 5630.22s]  we set the team up to investigate but then lost contact with them in the storm they would do to
[5630.22s -> 5634.54s]  check in over five hours ago but there is no way i'm going to send anyone else out there in this
[5634.54s -> 5648.06s]  weather medi the medi center one of these guys are gonna stand up this is a cafeteria oh stay

[5720.47s -> 5725.99s]  without the ability to cook them flame weaponry is the only way to kill large enemies when attacking
[5725.99s -> 5730.55s]  your target be sure to administer enough fuel to ignite them but be aware that the environment
[5730.55s -> 5734.79s]  and squad members could become part of the barbecue we learned that one the hard way
[5735.83s -> 5742.07s]  the flamethrower can also be used to lay down fire walls that can be used to pen enemy targets
[5743.03s -> 5758.58s]  what what do you mean wait there's a i have two flamethrowers oh shit there's a
[5758.58s -> 5775.40s]  mini flamethrower and then a big flamethrower nice nice job thank you oh i got one all right

[14921.08s -> 14930.25s]  to be able to determine what's fucking real and not real look this is the image this is the original
[14930.25s -> 14940.70s]  actual image that for those of you watching the vod this is the image somebody linked this okay
[14942.78s -> 14946.38s]  and they said that this is the this was real and everyone told me it was real and look at
[14946.38s -> 14953.96s]  how fucking crazy you look like really like that could it could be but it's not

[15014.23s -> 15034.89s]  so it was like all blurry and fucking small okay and then the big chin thing right so of course
[15034.89s -> 15039.21s]  i'm going to be skeptical of what's real and not because those of you who are here for the big chin
[15039.29s -> 15050.25s]  we're here for the big chin i don't mean you already know i mean fucking jesus
[15055.13s -> 15062.31s]  i can't get over this yet the chin was real but that's the thing it's the reverse
[15063.03s -> 15069.75s]  the chin was real but i was convinced it was fake this one was fake and i was convinced this
[15069.75s -> 15086.76s]  one was real it's just it's all over the place all right back to fucking the thing i guess
[15090.82s -> 15106.47s]  holy shit i this how is it already a monster in here that is so fucking ridiculous that was a true
[15106.47s -> 15113.27s]  breakdown on stream i i seriously that was a true breakdown that was a real one it may have been
[15113.27s -> 15132.41s]  comedy related but that was a comedy breakdown here we go well there's a new enemy type so these

[16500.34s -> 16505.78s]  little premature right now we need to have you both tested what the hell are you talking about
[16505.78s -> 16512.66s]  i'm not infected my men are dying out there i've seen firsthand just testing is capable of oh you
[16512.66s -> 16521.26s]  have no idea what it could do you son of a bitch what a slow motion sprint at him
[16522.54s -> 16535.91s]  does get shot in the head what i thought you were smarter than that jesus christ what are you doing
[16535.91s -> 16541.91s]  it's just a tranquilizer faraday do you have any idea what's going on out there i have a perfect
[16541.91s -> 16548.95s]  idea jesus you've done it haven't you you there's so much i have to show you he's infected i think
[16548.95s -> 16553.11s]  you'll be impressed with the result i'm tracking somebody in the face up sleeping beauty and
[16553.99s -> 16568.70s]  help escort the good doctor he's had a long day definitely infected no doubt it's pretty
[16568.70s -> 16575.18s]  much certainly security status amber in sectors one to five non-gen ink personnel are required
[16575.18s -> 16590.97s]  to leave the installation immediately look at that nerd neck the me i think that's me what do
[16590.97s -> 16596.50s]  you think you're doing faraday the infection is spread across the base all of the organisms have
[16596.50s -> 16601.22s]  to be destroyed if it reaches the mainland there's no stopping it wait did we just let this guy do
[16601.22s -> 16607.70s]  whatever they let him do whatever he wants that the infection can be controlled no no that's not
[16607.70s -> 16614.68s]  possible the results can't be ignored doctor i will be remembered as the first successful test
[16615.32s -> 16630.06s]  no not if i can help it i don't need your help never turn you back to somebody
[16631.10s -> 16637.10s]  right before you say not before i can help it reestablished in all sectors you think you'd want
[16637.10s -> 16651.72s]  to have a detention focus elsewhere he still would have got shot everybody would have been able to
[16651.72s -> 16670.74s]  like lunge for the gun where's my friend i got nothing medibate power turn it on hey
[16671.78s -> 16680.07s]  you the guy the person with the gun you are you are you in a prison cell with a gun
[16680.95s -> 16695.08s]  who the fuck is that i probably should have looked in the window of the door that would have been

[16744.78s -> 16765.19s]  first things first look through the window first and i wouldn't have seen it anyways he was he's

[16790.63s -> 16818.65s]  other okay well this is at the time this there's a lot of people around okay wait code
[16823.48s -> 16834.60s]  boston accent kind of sounded like it uh initial bio profile of test subject 873
[16834.60s -> 16839.96s]  suggests a high risk of cellular rejection if implanted with the b4 strain of the cloud virus
[16839.96s -> 16845.16s]  this is by no means conclusive but it leads me to think that subject 873 chief medical researcher
[16845.72s -> 16855.46s]  jen ink what do oh but it leads me to think that subject 873 may not be suitable due to illness
[16855.46s -> 16868.89s]  and company status so i gotta wait till he's out of the way he's turning corner now and we open the
[16868.89s -> 16875.88s]  door right next to me right here let's go get whatever i need out of here let's go fix it

[17059.05s -> 17069.24s]  been set to recognize his dna sequence his dna sequence the gates will sound the alarm if he
[17069.24s -> 17075.34s]  passes through and activate this automatic defense systems all other personnel can pass
[17075.34s -> 17079.66s]  through the gate without tripping the alarm the only problem is the malfunctioning gate in the

[18737.05s -> 18742.57s]  personally refused him after the tests i currently have him under observation his behavior is becoming
[18742.57s -> 18747.13s]  unpredictable in addition to this i'm getting varied reports about his behavior from different
[18747.13s -> 18752.01s]  security personnel i'm not sure whom to trust on this and may have to issue a request for
[18752.01s -> 18757.53s]  termination if things get out of hand the experiments on test subject 874 blake have
[18757.53s -> 18762.81s]  proved inconclusive what this seems to be a minute trace of a cellular anomaly
[18763.45s -> 18768.41s]  that could be related to the cloud virus i will need to do further tests as the subject has an
[18768.41s -> 18776.57s]  unusual amount of exposure to the virus in its many forms that's me are you hiding back there

[24917.34s -> 24926.81s]  his body to kill him i recommend too fast i recommend you too fast i recommend you throw
[24926.81s -> 24937.90s]  grenade you need to it's going too fast i can't do it go okay you need to hit the middle part
[24937.90s -> 24950.25s]  of his body i recommend throwing a grenade to his right all right all right sub only sub only sub
[24950.25s -> 24955.24s]  only sub only something sub only sub only put do sub only sub only sub only and then i could read
[24955.56s -> 24986.68s]  from there after you're out of grenades you need to hit the middle part of his body to kill him
[24987.40s -> 24991.80s]  i recommend throwing grenades over the rightmost box and after you're out of grenades
[24991.80s -> 24996.04s]  attempt to use the stun to finish him off with your ammo i beat this game a couple years ago
[24996.60s -> 25007.50s]  okay this box but i tried that last time and i fucking ruined everything
[25007.82s -> 25023.29s]  so over the over here it doesn't work man over the rightmost but i can't
[25024.01s -> 25041.74s]  i can't throw him any higher go into first person that wasn't part of the instructions
[25042.38s -> 25055.70s]  that wasn't part of the instructions oh my god this is fucking ridiculous all right get over here

[25182.57s -> 25216.97s]  like in the stomach stun and shoot him ah how many bullets does it take to kill this motherfucker
[25222.97s -> 25229.26s]  let's be very clear about something here that was seven high explosive grenades four regular
[25229.26s -> 25247.06s]  grenades and like five clips into his chest final shot needs to be fire wasn't part of
[25247.06s -> 25264.47s]  the instructions i didn't miss all the grenades turn on auto aim lower difficulty so you can see
[25264.47s -> 25274.71s]  his hp just look it up on you i don't know what this guy's called the final boss of the thing
[25275.43s -> 25282.44s]  he's almost in here oh thank god get in this time i'm not going to fuck this up stay there

[25508.79s -> 25525.03s]  no no no no can you imagine actually playing this game when it came out and try and being
[25525.03s -> 25546.39s]  like this is normal this is what you do this is just normal it's too scary
[25551.54s -> 25552.18s]  flamethrower
[25564.17s -> 25574.18s]  heal me please it's just a scratch stay back here don't go through the wall i might have to take his
[25574.18s -> 25613.35s]  shotgun hold still and i'll fix you up because just keep doing whatever you're doing there's

[25661.21s -> 25666.26s]  what's this thing called what's the name of this boss i don't care spoil the whole game
[25666.26s -> 25675.69s]  fuck it i don't give shit the hitbox is at the very top where it branches are you guys
[25675.69s -> 25690.42s]  fucking with me the thing boss two listen this is just fucking bonkers to me not the thing bird
[25690.42s -> 25699.82s]  two no not angry birds the movie too the thing boss two let's take a look the thing boss fight
[25702.52s -> 25712.20s]  how to beat the boss two hold on to three flame grenades i don't have those uh the thing second
[25712.20s -> 25716.52s]  boss is impossible i used to really like this game but the boss battles are simple hold on
[25723.66s -> 25728.94s]  i used to really like this game but the boss battles are simply frustrating to behold the second is
[25728.94s -> 25732.70s]  particularly annoying as you have to go into the first person mode to hit the boss properly
[25732.70s -> 25737.02s]  but unfortunately you're in a cramped space and get stuck on junk and get killed also when trying
[25737.02s -> 25741.18s]  to run back behind the crates in front of the door there appears to be a step that blake can't
[25741.18s -> 25758.12s]  walk over so um help me please beat this stupid game so i can be done with it and sell it okay
[25758.68s -> 25769.70s]  what do you mean sell it when was this posted 2001 okay if it's the one i'm thinking of with the big
[25769.70s -> 25777.94s]  ceiling tall thing and there are some tentacles that come out of the wall to your right it was
[25777.94s -> 25783.90s]  pretty easy wrong boss it's the one after that it's the one in the compound that you wake up
[25783.90s -> 25787.74s]  and after being captured behind the garage door in the big hanger that you enter after going
[25787.74s -> 25792.62s]  through the big tunnel i just enabled cheats to get through it but you gotta edit the registry
[25792.62s -> 25799.08s]  and start from scratch screw that okay let's continue hmm i don't think i've gotten to that
[25799.08s -> 25803.88s]  one yet i'm near the tail end of getting out of that facility but i ran my guy into an area to
[25803.88s -> 25808.84s]  explore and the floor suddenly caught on fire killing me and royally pissing me off because
[25808.84s -> 25813.24s]  there were no safe points near that area and i had already been trying to get through it hundreds of
[25813.24s -> 25822.79s]  times so i haven't played it since okay oh yeah you're much farther back than me oh yes i remember
[25822.79s -> 25830.73s]  that boss i believe it's the one with the what one trick for that one is that just inside the
[25830.73s -> 25834.25s]  door you can make shots between the crates with the incendiary grenade launcher in the back of
[25834.25s -> 25838.89s]  the boss and kill him remember to let each grenade burn out before firing the next one my brother
[25838.89s -> 25861.83s]  killed him with four grenades somebody's give 20 community subs this doesn't help me at all he's
[25861.83s -> 25909.22s]  dead did you what hey we just eat your shit watch out save save again okay you can follow me now
[25909.22s -> 25922.74s]  what was the point of this i don't know but thankfully i read yeah i've read that guide
[25922.74s -> 25933.51s]  look at my hair all we had to do was read i know i he had like two hp left you could just burn him
[25933.51s -> 25940.76s]  and run i thought you had to like cut his arm off or i don't know all right let's go game is saved

[31752.34s -> 31760.33s]  if you take a look at the top bits right now and just look at that absurd number you've crossed

[31814.33s -> 31825.26s]  spoiler spoiler for the halloween stream no that's not fun you just just know that it's going to be a
[31825.26s -> 31832.47s]  um a secret slime stream all four of their fine sniper spot to shoot c4 i know what that is it's
[31832.47s -> 31850.74s]  up there already found that one just hope i can get it back to where i was i killed everything

[31895.83s -> 31908.47s]  honest what happened i want to say i can sniper two of those c4 charges from here to detonate them
[31909.61s -> 31914.33s]  once i shoot that first charge security is going to be all over this place like flies on
[31914.33s -> 31919.45s]  shit i'm gonna have to haul ass to the other side of the tower to shoot out the other two charges
[31922.23s -> 31931.32s]  oh this is going to be awful i need to save i'm not doing this until i saved again
[31931.96s -> 31951.24s]  okay now i'm ready why that didn't i just shot the wheels off this i thought there's going to be
[31951.24s -> 31975.14s]  explosions one more and then what oh here come all the guards escape escape to where where where

[33505.30s -> 33513.02s]  those two games are one to two hours long each so if there's like an hour or two left of the thing
[33513.02s -> 33518.79s]  or like an hour left of the thing talking about it'll be like about five six hours total so that
[33518.79s -> 33528.23s]  works out pretty well looking forward to it so i will see you guys in a couple days uh i
[33528.31s -> 33535.43s]  unfortunately i cannot do the bits right now because i really do have to go i didn't think
[33535.43s -> 33540.23s]  i was gonna go this long but what will happen is like we do sometimes i'm gonna go over the bits
[33540.23s -> 33550.44s]  on holy shit there's so many uh we'll do this before and this could actually be a pretty good
[33550.44s -> 33563.70s]  thing to do yeah and this would be good to end it or even to begin it because this will probably
[33563.70s -> 33570.79s]  take about an hour or so to do and i i can't i just physically cannot i'm sorry but something
[33570.79s -> 33576.81s]  that we will do is at least take a look at some of the credits and i do have to say thank you
