[1.40s -> 14.62s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? How are you? What's the deal? Cool. Alright, we've covered that.
[14.62s -> 18.78s]  Let's uh, let's go over what we're doing today. Today we're gonna be doing uh, you know what's
[18.78s -> 27.80s]  weird? This is the first time I've talked in my clean office. I don't like it. It's echoey.
[28.36s -> 37.30s]  Usually there's a bunch of trash on the ground. The trash and CD cases and old video game consoles
[38.26s -> 43.51s]  that took up a majority of the floor and the closet have been sorted. They've been put away.
[44.55s -> 57.62s]  Now I can hear myself. I don't like this. Show us the clean office. Nah, make it messy again. No,
[58.58s -> 68.50s]  I have those, I have a bunch of those bass traps in the corners. I've got the foam all over the
[68.50s -> 74.74s]  place. My whole wall in front of me is all that audio foam over here. Am I right? I got it all
[74.74s -> 81.96s]  over the place. Don't matter. It's like I, you know, like anybody that streams on Twitch,
[81.96s -> 87.00s]  they're really looking for the grandma house. You know, when you go into grandmother's house
[87.00s -> 94.04s]  and there's just stuff everywhere, you know, houses full of things. So the audio quality
[94.04s -> 103.19s]  is incredible in a fucking old grandma house. You can hear your grandmother on the phone loud
[103.19s -> 110.17s]  and clear with no echo. It's because she has six bureaus in that room and her carpet is,
[111.38s -> 117.46s]  it's like two and a half inches thick, long strands. And there's probably six or seven
[117.46s -> 128.47s]  coats of wallpaper on the wall. I want that house. I need that house. But that house is like,
[128.47s -> 135.94s]  nobody wants to live there. But anyways, hi, how are you? We're going to finish Dead Rising 2,
[135.94s -> 145.19s]  off the record. Should be fairly simple. I know how it is with me. We're always very simple.
[147.94s -> 155.35s]  It's not going to be. Don't worry. I think there's only about three to four hours left of this game.
[156.60s -> 173.93s]  We'll see. But this will be the final Dead Rising oriented stream for a while. No, ever. No, not
[173.93s -> 182.82s]  ever. I'm going to play Dead Rising 3 eventually, probably like another month or two. I don't really
[182.82s -> 187.62s]  want to play that right now because I've played it before and I don't remember it was all right.
[188.26s -> 194.84s]  It was fun. I guess it wasn't like these though. But this is the last Dead Rising stream
[195.56s -> 199.53s]  that you're going to get for a while. So let's hop right into it. Those of you that weren't here
[199.53s -> 209.70s]  before and those of you that have never been here before. Hey, appreciate the follow. I want to look
[209.70s -> 223.18s]  at this first though. Did I get anything new? I have a shit load of time for 8-2. That's where
[223.18s -> 233.70s]  we are. Where the hell is this guy even on the cases? He's here. So we've got a huge amount of
[233.70s -> 242.79s]  time and a day for 8-2, then 8-3, and then the facts, and then overtime. Zombie mutating gas
[242.79s -> 248.60s]  seems to be coming from the underground. I've got to find the source. But take a look. I've got a
[248.60s -> 257.35s]  lot. We're not going to let this get to yellow. TK is also infected. That's the only two things
[257.35s -> 265.27s]  I have right now though. TK needs Zombrex, although I'm not sure he deserves it. When do I need Zombrex?
[268.22s -> 273.18s]  I'm just gonna go buy one. All right, I'm gonna go buy like two Zombrexes from the store.
[278.79s -> 288.42s]  I got plenty of good items. You still have 21 Connect games to play. Don't think we forgot.
[295.75s -> 304.79s]  There's not that many, I can assure you. There's probably seven or eight Connect games.
[310.36s -> 314.92s]  All right, why is this so loud for me? What's going on here? I have to turn this down.
[316.34s -> 327.38s]  Why is it so loud for me? Is it loud for you? No, it should be fine, right? Why is it so loud for me?
[327.38s -> 338.14s]  I don't know. All right, so what's this magazine? I'll write edge weapons. So these last a lot
[338.14s -> 346.02s]  longer break this fucking box. I've got a good, I don't have to do anything. This is great.
[346.02s -> 354.79s]  Just go buy Zombrex from the store and end it. Oh shit, I forgot they, I forgot they coughed.
[356.23s -> 365.51s]  I forgot about the coughing mechanism. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[366.15s -> 378.09s]  He's already angry. No, I'm fine. I just turned it down to like 30%. Did my computer get louder
[378.09s -> 392.71s]  in two days, three days? What is going on? Did I get a Windows update? Increased your volume
[392.71s -> 398.07s]  permanently by like 200%. All right, watch out. These, this, every time I come in here,
[398.07s -> 402.39s]  these fucking idiots stroll up behind me and they cause a huge problem. I'm ready for them
[403.19s -> 417.19s]  and they're not going to come in this time. He's already mad. No, I'm not mad.
[417.19s -> 425.53s]  All right, they're not going to come in this time. All right, I'm going to buy Zombrex. I was going
[425.53s -> 431.43s]  to buy like three of them. How many of these do I need? Look at, I have tons of money. I was
[431.43s -> 444.66s]  going to buy another one. I have three now. All right, I'm done. Okay, so now I'm going to go to
[444.66s -> 459.48s]  the maintenance place. Big bits already. That was a pretty good lie. Give me the coin. Got the coin.
[460.28s -> 480.10s]  So now I've got enough Zom, TK is infected. I have a long time for this. Save TK.
[481.06s -> 487.62s]  I mean, I'm just going to go do it, right? I should just go do this right now.
[492.25s -> 504.86s]  I need to do this. Well, I mean, I have the opportunity to, so why not just do it?
[505.42s -> 518.41s]  Play it on the map. That's why in Grand Theft Auto 4 and 5, even if I played the game for 200 hours,
[519.13s -> 524.01s]  it doesn't matter. I still need the GPS. Blame technology for that one, guys.
[524.97s -> 534.44s]  Blame like the invention. I was going to say the inventation. Like it's a different noun when
[534.44s -> 542.78s]  you're talking about something that was invented versus the invention of satellite tracking and GPS
[542.78s -> 559.85s]  systems. Inventation. That's like incantation. All right, let's make the defiler. Let's go.
[560.57s -> 572.18s]  Blame the incantations. It's always their fault. Did you mean innovation? Yes, innovation and
[572.18s -> 581.54s]  invention combined. Inventation. Just give me a minute. I'll be okay. All right, let's go save TK.
[586.20s -> 601.67s]  Don't get up from your seats. Everything's going to be fine. Save TK. He's lying down on a bed
[601.67s -> 617.70s]  somewhere, right? Which bed is he in? The security room? Where even is this dude? Everybody's just
[617.70s -> 633.64s]  crying. Yeah. You wouldn't be crying right now? Where is he? Downstairs? Which storage room?
[634.60s -> 646.65s]  I know he's lying down on something. All right, maybe everybody crying is a little odd, right?
[646.65s -> 651.85s]  Maybe I would assume some people would be crying. But every single person is crying. You're right.
[651.85s -> 663.10s]  It is a little odd. All right, pick a door. Where is TK? Somebody help me. Upstairs next to the
[663.10s -> 676.10s]  cafe. Thank you. They're waiting for me to get close. Then they start crying. All right, TK.
[677.18s -> 688.50s]  Don't make me regret this. This was $150,000.
[707.98s -> 711.66s]  Now the move right there is to not flinch and to look right in the eyes and say,
[712.54s -> 723.34s]  is that supposed to hurt? Wait, what? I thought I just hit him with a box
[723.34s -> 743.98s]  because my head's too big. Just spit on my mask. I'm fine. All right, cool. So thanks, little man.
[743.98s -> 749.98s]  I was starting to feel real hungry. I knew you'd come through. You're welcome. The only reason I'm
[749.98s -> 755.99s]  doing this is so you can do the time, scumbag. No easy way out for you. I, whatever. All right,
[755.99s -> 777.53s]  this is it. The only lead. Let's go. Just one once. Man of my word. All right, let's do the only
[777.53s -> 787.72s]  lead. Now where is this? This is all the way in Atlantica Casino. Let's do it. Might as well
[787.72s -> 794.41s]  do some fun stuff. Yeah. Those of you guys that have played this game, is this a scenario where
[794.41s -> 798.33s]  I'm going to have a funny time or can I just go dick around and level up and go find stuff?
[802.09s -> 805.61s]  Do I, is this, is this one of those missions that takes 10 straight minutes to do?
[812.76s -> 819.66s]  You never have time. I know. It's pretty quick. All right. Well, I have a save point right at
[819.66s -> 823.90s]  that checkpoint. I got a checkpoint here. All right, let's just, let's just look around.
[824.86s -> 833.02s]  Then something might pop up. You never know. We're going for a coffee creamer.
[833.90s -> 841.69s]  Look, if this is the final Dead Rising 2 stream, I've, I've got to milk it. That's
[841.69s -> 845.61s]  someone that's going to run to the finish line. No, I got to milk this. This is the last time you're
[845.61s -> 850.65s]  going to see this ever. I will never play this game ever again. You are never going to see this
[850.65s -> 857.61s]  game on stream and video format ever again. So why not? Like check this out. Pretty good swing.
[864.10s -> 878.07s]  Okay. Okay. Good swing. Pretty good swing. What's this? Jello? Chili.
[878.87s -> 885.70s]  Uh, if this is one thing I would never eat, it'd be one of those. I'm not going to eat a cup of open
[885.70s -> 893.22s]  chili, even in a zombie apocalypse. I'd rather eat one of these people. Is that gross? That was a
[893.22s -> 903.24s]  little too gross, I think. Wasn't it? I'm not sure if it's untrue though. It, I don't think it, it
[903.24s -> 919.82s]  might not be untrue. True. Sneakers. Stupid. Well, we got you. I need to be in my final outfit though.
[920.84s -> 925.00s]  I, I really like this. I really like this outfit. I don't think I want to get rid of it.
[925.88s -> 941.34s]  I feel like this outfit's perfect. No shoes. I can't have no shoes. I already looked it up.
[942.30s -> 949.46s]  I looked it up. I went to Fextralife slash Dead Rising 2 off the record and I went to all
[949.46s -> 958.89s]  available shoes. It's not there. Wait, somebody said, wait, we, this is our opportunity. Let's
[958.89s -> 979.86s]  roll a seven. Three. Ooh, no, almost. This is real, right? There's a six. Give me one. Oh,
[981.37s -> 987.37s]  that's real. That's actually a real thing. Are you serious? Nice work, person that said that
[987.37s -> 998.07s]  four days ago. Should I go back to the casino? I got, what do I do? Should I just play casino
[998.07s -> 1013.24s]  games for like four hours? Well, I'm going to be in the casino anyways. Oh, by the way,
[1013.24s -> 1015.40s]  if you're wondering what's going to happen either later today or tomorrow,
[1016.36s -> 1026.52s]  uh, we're going to be playing Katamari. I don't remember. It's Katamari adjective or Katamari
[1026.52s -> 1030.12s]  forever. Katamari. Beautiful Katamari. The one with 360. I don't know. I don't know the names.
[1030.92s -> 1036.04s]  It's not like Katamari one. Katamari two. Beautiful Katamari. There it is. All right.
[1037.00s -> 1047.03s]  Let me go this way. Queen. Let's replace Queen with Queen. I'm almost level 31.
[1047.83s -> 1057.42s]  Let's go upstairs. Forever is PS3. I also have the DLC for it. I heard it's a pretty short game.
[1058.30s -> 1069.56s]  So I got DLC. Uh, there's a cap though. No, I can't take this off. One piece pajama.
[1071.43s -> 1081.85s]  Oh, it's this thing again. It's this. I've had this on for way too long though. Didn't I?
[1082.89s -> 1093.74s]  This is the thing I had on before. Goblin activate. I, you know, fucking let's go.
[1093.74s -> 1108.55s]  Let's go. Final Dead Rising 2 stream. Whatever. I'm getting in the car. Let's go. Let's fucking go.
[1108.55s -> 1116.57s]  Bro. Bro. I didn't say bro. Why does it want, what is it trying even to do? Um, find the source
[1116.57s -> 1136.74s]  to get in the only underground tunnels. I, oh, I can't bring my car. Have I been here? Machete
[1137.54s -> 1151.10s]  and machete and drill. Drillachete. Machete and I know I can make this.
[1152.22s -> 1158.68s]  Roman machete. But is that even worth taking? I don't think this thing's very good. Is this
[1158.68s -> 1166.38s]  thing very good? Flashlight and gems. Yeah, I've made that already. I mean, it is pretty good,
[1167.18s -> 1171.26s]  but then I run out of space. Just drink the coffee Kramer. Not like I'm going to need it.
[1172.06s -> 1178.36s]  Because I don't want to lose the katana. Katana's really good. How does this not, uh,
[1180.12s -> 1189.96s]  calcify, how does this not calcify as a blade weapon? Big bits. Huge. That's enormous bits.
[1189.96s -> 1197.62s]  That is the biggest bits like ever. Hold on. That was, how much was that?
[1199.56s -> 1207.69s]  12,000 bits from Freddy Dredd. There's not even a message here. It's just 12,000 bits
[1208.73s -> 1219.46s]  from Freddy. Freddy, thanks for the more than $100. 120 converted currency dollars.
[1222.20s -> 1226.84s]  Okay. There's people here. I didn't know. These guys are blue. Does that mean anything?
[1227.72s -> 1234.39s]  Yeah, there's no message. It's just a huge drop of money. Thanks, Freddy.
[1237.06s -> 1244.02s]  It's the blue team. I think I got good weapons. I actually, you know, I want to run these guys
[1244.02s -> 1248.54s]  over a thing. When's my last safe point? I don't know. I did. I need a safe point right here.
[1249.90s -> 1262.90s]  They blew it up. I need a gun. If I'm going to be dealing with guns now,
[1271.66s -> 1279.66s]  do the make the wheelchair gun thing. Yeah, I really should do that. I'm just so indecisive.
[1280.62s -> 1291.80s]  That's too slow. I think it's coming up here. Hard hat and beer is an estus flask. How am I
[1291.80s -> 1303.34s]  supposed to get up there? How am I supposed to reliably kill these guys? I'm going for it.
[1306.17s -> 1314.25s]  Stop puffing. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Stop it. I think there's a gun in
[1314.25s -> 1323.18s]  here. No, I got a security uniform. Are they going to come in here? Oh, I got to get the big,
[1323.18s -> 1329.11s]  big guy is going to come up with this. This is where I get my gun. I'm going to just baseball
[1329.11s -> 1338.31s]  swing them in the face. Come on in. I'm just going to spin when he comes in the door,
[1341.14s -> 1346.28s]  kill them for me. So I don't have to do this. They'll get it. They'll come in.
[1350.14s -> 1356.65s]  Shoot them. Thank you. Thank you. Nice. All right. Now make your way in here. How did that miss?
[1359.83s -> 1368.30s]  They just have the door covered. How am I supposed to, are they going to come in?
[1369.26s -> 1379.48s]  There's a shotgun. Where's there a shotgun? Oh, that you mean that thing. All right. Okay.
[1394.23s -> 1413.27s]  That's what we like to call a double Q. Okay, I gotta go. Salt rifle and I'm going to replace
[1413.27s -> 1418.42s]  let's another assault rifle. It's going to be machine gun people. It's not worth it. You know
[1418.42s -> 1425.78s]  it. I know it. I'm not going to pretend like it's worth having that. Wait, coffee creamer.
[1426.42s -> 1433.48s]  No, it's just coffee. It's not worth taking. Make gun wheelchair. All right. Hold on.
[1434.28s -> 1440.62s]  Wheelchair, wheelchair, wheelchair, wheelchair. I'm getting it. I'm getting it. I'm getting it.
[1441.82s -> 1452.20s]  Um, oh no. Just, is it just one gun and wheelchair? Hurry, hurry up and do it.
[1453.00s -> 1460.36s]  It's not gun and wheelchair. What are you talking about? Wheelchair plus battery plus gun.
[1464.87s -> 1479.00s]  Wait, it needs to be electric. This is a double combination. Oh fuck it is. Are you serious?
[1479.64s -> 1496.95s]  Let me see. Holy shit. Okay. Can I get in it?
[1502.39s -> 1505.11s]  All right. Why doesn't professor X just have this on his wheelchair?
[1506.23s -> 1530.79s]  Wouldn't this help a little? Like there's no reason to not have that attached, right? What's
[1530.79s -> 1543.43s]  the downside of having this as professor X? They're behind. How am I supposed to get behind
[1543.43s -> 1558.89s]  this sandbag? This is the stupidest thing. It's not even hitting them. Yeah, it was pretty cool.
[1566.07s -> 1576.47s]  All right. I don't want to waste it. I would like it if it went faster.
[1582.74s -> 1592.74s]  200% screen shake. Yeah, it actually kind of sucked. I'm going to wrap around this way.
[1593.22s -> 1597.43s]  Okay. That's a rocket launcher potential, but I can't get out.
[1598.71s -> 1636.26s]  It's not even good. What am I supposed to do? Give me the other one. All right. That wheelchair
[1636.26s -> 1654.76s]  thing is not very good. Find the source of the gas? Found it. It has infinite ammo.
[1655.88s -> 1683.78s]  So just hold, but the screen shake is a downside. This is a wheelchair gone. I sort of blend in.
[1684.50s -> 1693.69s]  I'm just the cartoon caricature version that you get at the theme park of the zombies.
[1696.42s -> 1708.60s]  The only thing that's missing is I need to be on a small bicycle,
[1709.24s -> 1720.36s]  riding a surfboard, or holding a huge lollipop. I'm pretty sure all those things are in this game
[1720.36s -> 1750.98s]  too. So that works. Not like this. Why? Why do emotes? Emotes have just taken over our thoughts.
[1753.14s -> 1771.10s]  Seriously, when I think of something that's unnerving or kind of scary, I just see that
[1771.10s -> 1780.57s]  Pepe face, the monk ass that I just see it. I just, Oh, fuck. I don't even make that face.
[1780.57s -> 1799.05s]  I just think about somebody in chat writing that face. I didn't save the game. Like anytime I'm
[1799.05s -> 1804.41s]  in a scary scenario, if it's terrifying, I'm just like, Oh, somebody in chat just wrote monk ass.
[1804.41s -> 1810.09s]  Like I'm not scared. I'm just, somebody else is scared for me. All right. I gotta be careful.
[1810.09s -> 1817.50s]  Should I not have shot those? Is it, was that a bad idea? Did I, am I causing a problem?
[1826.15s -> 1839.64s]  Uh-oh. Wait, hard hat and beer, right? I'll take it for later. But first I need,
[1840.28s -> 1852.81s]  Oh, am I going to get over there? Onion rings quick. Done right there. Nice. Pick it up.
[1853.37s -> 1875.24s]  Pick it up. Move. My, where's the gun? Put down the fucking keyboard. Put down the keyboard.
[1876.04s -> 1880.55s]  All right. You know, some games have like, Oh, if I pick this up, just automatically trash it.
[1880.55s -> 1890.57s]  Can I add keyboards to that list? Can I just auto just trash keyboards? I probably needed that.
[1892.76s -> 1901.02s]  Boxes. Let me just, what? This is like a laser blast frequency gun. I'll change that up for a
[1901.02s -> 1910.74s]  keyboard. What does this do? Another blast frequency gun. Which one's better? It's a lot
[1910.74s -> 1930.55s]  of food here. The hard hat. I need to, should I WWF somebody? Okay. Gun. Uh, eat this. Just eat
[1930.55s -> 1939.00s]  something. I want full health. How many, what do I have for healing? Uh, it's all right. It's not
[1939.00s -> 1951.29s]  terrible. Hit somebody with a steel chair. I don't have enough room for it. Hold on. What's over this
[1951.29s -> 1977.90s]  way? No, don't want it. Make room. Yeah. Things are going just as predicted. Absorption of the
[1977.90s -> 1983.58s]  compound is at 80% of ideal. And maturation rates are 10 times normal. Yes. I changed.
[1985.42s -> 1993.94s]  Not supposed to be in here. Oh, it's Dave. It's Dave. I work here. I just thought it'd
[1993.94s -> 2011.46s]  be funny to come out on Halloween like this. Wait, kill them? Uh, what is this gun do?
[2013.48s -> 2036.30s]  It just makes them grow up. What a way to die. That was not fun.
[2041.75s -> 2045.35s]  Desktop. Clean up that desktop. I hate, that's an anxiety desktop.
[2045.99s -> 2072.25s]  Move those icons. Put some folders there. You're freaking me out. Taking the coffee. Oh, and by
[2072.25s -> 2083.51s]  the way? Well, I don't think this guy makes it Frank. You should have just let me borrow
[2083.51s -> 2089.03s]  your phone, boys. Somebody just brews a pot like 12 hours ago and it just sits on the heater.
[2089.67s -> 2098.82s]  Of course it sucks. Like I didn't like make that. There's no French press in here, Frank.
[2100.18s -> 2108.74s]  All right, here we go. The source of the gas is a paramilitary operation underneath the city.
[2109.62s -> 2121.42s]  The others need to hear about this. All right. So what we got? Full heel. I told you.
[2122.62s -> 2131.34s]  I'll take a queen. I'll take a full heel. Um, give me the, I'll replace this. What is that? Like a VR
[2132.54s -> 2147.27s]  military case defibrillator. Take a computer. Take a computer. Why am I taking a computer?
[2147.91s -> 2160.23s]  Take a computer. A puke gun and the computer. All right. I'll try it. I have to carry it though.
[2160.87s -> 2173.05s]  No, take it with the amp. Amp. Puke gun and amplifier. Where's there an amp?
[2173.69s -> 2187.69s]  The guitar amp. Well, why am I taking this then? He doesn't see it. There's no amp in here. Where
[2187.69s -> 2198.25s]  do you see an amp? I gotta go. It's behind you. Stop reading chat. Yeah. Good idea. That's a
[2198.25s -> 2220.78s]  fantastic solution. I thought that was an amp right there. Ooh, urgent. Yep. Do I answer? Why
[2220.78s -> 2245.03s]  am I not answering? Amp in here. Amp. Oh, is this what you guys want? Super BFG. Blast frequency
[2245.03s -> 2250.82s]  gun and amplifier. 15 shots. All right. I'm not going to use it. I'm going to hold onto it.
[2253.34s -> 2264.74s]  Guitar and guitar and flashlight. Wait, flashlight and computer. That's just a
[2265.30s -> 2270.70s]  that's just a zoomer jack-o-lantern. No. Um, I don't know.
[2289.90s -> 2293.42s]  You can't even make a jack-o-lantern. How many times do I have to talk about the
[2293.42s -> 2299.90s]  jack-o-lantern portion of that stream? I was covered in slime and had knives in my hands
[2299.90s -> 2305.42s]  and the whole ground was covered in slime. That's how you die. That's how you end up in
[2305.42s -> 2312.22s]  the hospital. I canned that portion of that stream. Uh-uh. The whole ground was covered
[2312.22s -> 2317.66s]  in a substance that if I take a quarter of a step to my right, I go and split backwards
[2318.54s -> 2331.85s]  and you want me to hold a knife while I do that. I don't understand. Does he just not know how to
[2331.93s -> 2340.06s]  carve a pumpkin? Why won't he hold the knife in his hand that's covered in slime?
[2341.94s -> 2359.43s]  Oh, beer. Do I still have the hard hat? No. Sorry, guys. I don't have the hard hat.
[2365.50s -> 2370.58s]  This thing's actually pretty good against zombies. You shouldn't have gotten slime.
[2371.54s -> 2380.78s]  All right. Whatever you say. Am I carrying a magazine? Yeah, it's for sharp weapons.
[2386.78s -> 2393.50s]  15 shots in this thing. Do I even still have it? Yeah. I have to save the fucking game, guys.
[2394.55s -> 2408.74s]  All right. Hard hat, which I replace. This thing's pretty much broken. What about the gun? Oh, but I
[2408.74s -> 2422.30s]  need it. I need this gun in case. Get rid of the edged weapons. The magazine. The queen. Let me
[2422.30s -> 2427.62s]  at least get a use out of this then. The wrench. No, let me get the... I'm gonna use this. I still
[2427.62s -> 2434.52s]  have the katana. Yeah, the katana is a good weapon. Sword is broken against the bosses. That's true.
[2435.32s -> 2441.35s]  You're wasting time. Fuck. They're right. No, they're right. They're right. No, they're right.
[2441.35s -> 2443.67s]  They're right. No, they're right. No, they're right. No, they're right. No, they're right. They're
[2443.67s -> 2465.16s]  right. No, no, no, no, they're right. They're right. I just... I'm almost 31. All right. Just
[2465.16s -> 2474.01s]  give me a hard hat. I can't get rid of the gun. It's so good at range. It's just... It's so good.
[2474.01s -> 2487.21s]  Is there money? Suitcase. Wait, can I... Nothing in these? I guess not. Okay. Wait. Don't I have
[2487.21s -> 2513.32s]  keys? Is this the safety deposit box room? What if I have another keys? Any case.
[2514.76s -> 2519.88s]  Does money even matter anymore though? Let's be honest. That's $150,000. That's pretty good.
[2528.30s -> 2546.09s]  All right. Ooh, you got a gun. Oh, shit. Get away from me. I just... Okay. Good. Salt rifle.
[2546.09s -> 2548.41s]  That's what I wanted. That's what I wanted. There's a queen there, but I don't care.
[2550.34s -> 2559.59s]  Use the super BFG. Not necessary. All right. Where am I going? Oh, I gotta go back. Like, hurry up.
[2560.23s -> 2578.78s]  Through the trail. Try it out. No. There's a safe point right here. I'm not off locked.
[2578.78s -> 2590.23s]  I've got time. Look, I got time. 8-2. We're gonna do the middle one. I got time. No, I actually do.
[2613.34s -> 2621.19s]  Get away from me. All right. I'll use it once. Oh my god. That's ridiculous.
[2621.83s -> 2637.34s]  Okay. All right. I gotta go. All this because I saved it. I should have just ran down the...
[2639.05s -> 2646.68s]  Kill me. Just kill me. I'm gonna restart right there. I got, I got, I got screwed over because
[2646.68s -> 2662.66s]  I saved the game and I turned around and there's 10 people behind me. There's no reason to take,
[2662.66s -> 2666.98s]  like, seven cheese slices of damage. There's no reason to do that. I have, like, full health.
[2669.70s -> 2674.02s]  See? Like, why would I do that? I don't even care about the katana. The thing's broken anyway.
[2674.98s -> 2697.14s]  Are you seriously gonna interrupt my attack with that, with the sneeze?
[2698.34s -> 2705.67s]  Use the BFG. I'm gonna use the BFG for the last helicopter that's in the game.
[2706.63s -> 2732.54s]  I'm gonna shoot the helicopter, like, five times and I win. Oh, don't stop the stun. Okay, it's
[2732.54s -> 2752.07s]  actually kind of fun. All right. No, I'll take it down to 10. I shouldn't really take that coffee,
[2752.07s -> 2765.69s]  but I kind of don't want to stop. There's orange juice right here. Oh, that's nice. Let's move.
[2766.49s -> 2774.01s]  I'm almost there. It's a crotch weapon, crotch weapon, crotch weapon, boomerang.
[2779.50s -> 2785.26s]  You're really good at throwing the boomerang, friend. Okay, third time's the charm. Third
[2785.26s -> 2810.33s]  time's the charm. Let's go. Why are you side arming it? You should, uh, BFG. Hehehehe. L-U-L.
[2812.23s -> 2817.56s]  Wear the Shaun of the Dead shirt. No, I'm, this, this is not a licensed stream.
[2818.82s -> 2835.30s]  This is an unlicensed stream. Okay, save it again. This is the final thing, 8-3, and then we got the
[2835.30s -> 2844.73s]  last mission coming up. You're wearing a street fighter mask. Um, when did I ever say the word
[2844.73s -> 2853.62s]  street and then fighter next to each other? No, this is big green man face. Where are you
[2853.62s -> 2873.06s]  getting that idea from? Okay, I'm, is there alcohol? Get the beer hat? I know. There's
[2873.06s -> 2903.24s]  gonna be alcoholic right here. It's the Zombrex company. They wanted to infect everybody so
[2903.24s -> 2910.95s]  then they could sell everybody Zombrex. It's a conspiracy.
[2935.48s -> 2940.62s]  Yeah, but if the world was all zombies then what the hell, what are you gonna do with money?
[2942.04s -> 2942.52s]  Burn it?
[2956.98s -> 2959.83s]  Oh, they're lining up for Zombrex. They're paying with like cash.
[2960.95s -> 2962.87s]  What the fuck was that? Did I do that?
[2970.12s -> 2985.45s]  Oh no, she grabbed my gun. The backstab.
[2995.61s -> 3014.06s]  No. Fake hair? Wait, did I just pull her whole scalp off? Is it wig?
[3026.90s -> 3046.01s]  Oh, obliterate. Okay, well that was a little... Stacey is with the Fentatrans. She's harvesting
[3046.01s -> 3066.34s]  all the zombies and trying to kill me. Go right, right. The cutscene is way less emotional when
[3066.34s -> 3071.91s]  you're wearing the mask. All right, the facts. So I gotta wear the beer helmet. That's important.
[3072.55s -> 3079.53s]  Any whiskey in here? Wait, you could have been a great, you could have been a great kid.
[3080.17s -> 3088.30s]  We could have been great. I'm reading that wrong. You didn't deserve this,
[3088.30s -> 3092.20s]  Sullivan. I can't believe I didn't see through that bitch's lies.
[3101.30s -> 3104.10s]  Sicko, psycho, sicko. This is for the police, guys. Come on.
[3118.68s -> 3134.33s]  So that's the final boss? Where's TK? Oh, it's all right. I got the fucking BFG.
[3135.29s -> 3146.30s]  Is there whiskey in here? No, it's snacks. No whiskey? All right, whiskey is everywhere.
[3146.30s -> 3153.02s]  So I have to make that before a thousand people unsub this channel. So bear with me here for a
[3153.02s -> 3180.04s]  minute, guys. It's beer. Okay, right. TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK,
[3180.04s -> 3200.01s]  TK. Okay. Everybody saying TK. All right. Let's go see what's going on. TK, how are you?
[3205.37s -> 3220.52s]  It's the same conversation I had before. How long are some of your guys and noses at this point?
[3221.24s -> 3225.83s]  You guys tell any more fucking lies, your noses going through the monitor.
[3226.55s -> 3234.52s]  I'm surprised you can even make it through a doorway. Well, no, that's just straight on.
[3234.52s -> 3241.98s]  So you'd be fine. Don't turn though. You'll break in half. Jill Krung gets thanks for the
[3241.98s -> 3252.01s]  five community subs. No beer? All right. The facts. I'm just looking for the fact.
[3256.02s -> 3262.10s]  One beer is all I need. I'm going to go to the bar. There's usually a bar. Where's there a bar?
[3262.10s -> 3272.81s]  The closest bar. The drink bean. I mean, this is the drink bean, but they don't have beer here,
[3272.81s -> 3291.02s]  do they? You don't serve a beer at a coffee shop. No, Vegas does. Yeah, but that's different. All
[3291.02s -> 3297.58s]  right. Where's there just a bar or a beer? I know there's one like all the way down. Sports. What's
[3297.58s -> 3308.95s]  in the middle here? Something in the middle. The craps thing. Yeah, there might even be one over
[3308.95s -> 3327.99s]  here. I'll take another orange juice. Yes, I will. I love minestrone soup. That's pretty good. Yeah.
[3327.99s -> 3340.22s]  It's very, it's very good. I'm with you on that one. All right. Beer. Just coffee creamer. Oh my
[3340.22s -> 3350.92s]  goodness. Can I puke with the mask on? Oh, they have anti-puke shields. Wait, he has one. Why is
[3350.92s -> 3374.82s]  it working on me? It's because I'm infected. Oh, that's what it is, huh? Weird. All right. I need
[3374.82s -> 3392.22s]  a beer. Beer. No beers in there? How's that possible? It's a craps table. Perfect opportunity.
[3392.86s -> 3414.33s]  Check it out. Nice. That felt good. All right. No more. Looking for a beer. Wait, see one?
[3415.13s -> 3445.40s]  That's, is that a beer or is that ketchup? Damn it. It's ketchup. What about the security box stuff?
[3446.12s -> 3464.18s]  I feel like I missed a whole portion of this game. What's it called? Jump scare, jump space.
[3465.14s -> 3497.24s]  Fortune city bank. Let's go. I don't think this is a car. I really don't. It does not operate like a
[3497.24s -> 3511.16s]  car. This thing floats. It's on air. That thing controls like an air hockey puck. What's going on?
[3511.80s -> 3556.15s]  Bastards. The world has got to see this. Photo time. This is unbelievable.
[3558.18s -> 3563.22s]  Ah, the tree got in the way. No, it's not. It's a very bad photo actually.
[3564.34s -> 3578.17s]  But I think I still, I think I got it. Where am I going? This way. Save point. I don't want to get
[3578.17s -> 3583.67s]  too overzealous because I don't want to activate the final game. Frank needs Zombrex. Oh shit,
[3583.67s -> 3605.18s]  I forgot I could take that. Watch out. It's a pod. Did I kill this? God damn it. I got a picture of
[3605.18s -> 3643.80s]  the pod. No, that's not what I want. All right, let's destroy this thing. Destroy it. Nice. What
[3643.80s -> 3658.10s]  did that do? Why am I playing with the controller? Because I prefer controllers. For third person
[3658.10s -> 3669.86s]  action games, I play GTA with a controller. Playing with a controller. I know it has terrible
[3669.86s -> 3676.18s]  analog aiming, but moving around and walking around is a lot better than WASD for third person
[3676.18s -> 3684.10s]  games. I just like it. I like the analog. There's WASD for subtle turns like what you just saw right
[3684.10s -> 3696.49s]  there. Son of a bitch. Mouse is only good for first person. It depends. It depends. Oh my god.
[3706.38s -> 3722.82s]  Oh fuck, this is very bad. Where is he? Okay, so they're just everywhere. They're everywhere
[3722.82s -> 3726.50s]  and they're wearing like all gray, so they blend in with the background of the game.
[3750.30s -> 3762.60s]  You know what? No, it's not. There's not enough people to do this.
[3763.32s -> 3784.14s]  Get the fuck away from me. Is there a reason for me to do this? Does anybody know?
[3787.11s -> 3807.90s]  Queen. I definitely don't want to get rid of that. Here, just back my machine gun.
[3808.70s -> 3822.73s]  Let me back my rifle. Let's go. Wait. Okay. Easy, easy, easy. All right, watch out for the military.
[3822.73s -> 3835.94s]  They're like right over here. Just hug the wall. BFG. Doesn't matter. Well, it takes just one guy.
[3836.58s -> 3873.88s]  There's a beast standing near you. That's it, right? Yep. Boom. All right. Any assault rifles?
[3877.51s -> 3908.58s]  Have I screamed yet? Not yet. Blueberry Buffet. Let's go. Turn, please scream. Why do you guys
[3908.58s -> 3924.18s]  want me to scream? All right. Save points right ahead. I'm going to do that. I'm going to take...
[3925.14s -> 3929.88s]  Do I have room? There's a lot of food here. They can't get over here, so.
[3932.78s -> 3939.45s]  They can't get over here, right? I still need a beer. Did anybody see a beer?
[3940.01s -> 3966.79s]  No, there's a large soda. No beer. Beer? When you don't want one, they're just never around.
[3966.79s -> 3982.18s]  But when you do want one, you can never find it. Money? Go to the bar? Well, let me go to the bank
[3982.18s -> 3990.30s]  first. Because I have all these security keys that I don't know where the hell they're for,
[3990.30s -> 3995.34s]  and it's the final, like the final portion of this whole game. Save it, please.
[3997.48s -> 4015.53s]  I remember this fight. Wow, look at all these memories we made in Dead Rising 2.
[4015.53s -> 4027.22s]  Too many to count. Let's do this one.
[4034.50s -> 4039.02s]  Yeah, remember we came in here? There's a boss that ran around in circles and stuff.
[4040.84s -> 4058.31s]  Beer in the trash. Does vodka count? No. Scrounging into the garbage cans with drinks.
[4060.31s -> 4067.93s]  Two bottles of vodka, for real? I don't even want it. I wanted to see it break. Go to the bar?
[4067.93s -> 4079.30s]  Yeah, I know, but if it's like here, I'm going to do it. Because I need a maintenance permit anyways.
[4079.30s -> 4104.63s]  Where the hell am I? Oh, this is the bank. No, it's not. Food. Coming soon. Music. Bagged. Sports.
[4105.59s -> 4114.20s]  Venice Touch. Where's the actual, is the bar right in the middle here? Space, jump space. Right here.
[4114.76s -> 4143.29s]  I'll get it after this. The bank. So I'm in the bank. Security clearance accepted.
[4144.33s -> 4149.56s]  Look at all these boxes. Security box one. How much money was in there? $50,000?
[4154.65s -> 4172.17s]  Hold on, this is all this money? 329. No, why didn't I just come here? Locked. $900,000 in there.
[4173.99s -> 4192.60s]  Oh, $40,000. Thank god. $185,000, $10,000, $999,000. There's Zombrex in here. That's unbelievable.
[4195.78s -> 4202.41s]  Okay, let's just, might as well open them all. I'm here. There's Zombrex in here, too.
[4206.28s -> 4212.86s]  Gems? I don't need, I don't want these. I have four Zombrex. Should I just take two?
[4213.50s -> 4233.43s]  What happens if I stick myself a Zombrex twice? Just gems. That's shitty. Well, that's an extra
[4233.43s -> 4250.44s]  almost $500,000 from the security boxes. You become immune. Well, buy the car again. That's
[4250.44s -> 4261.46s]  not gonna do anything for me, though. Well, that was cool. Now let's go to the bar and then I'm
[4261.46s -> 4278.50s]  gonna go to the maintenance room and get, people will resubscribe. Imagine not buying the Hummer
[4278.50s -> 4295.67s]  and buying the sports car instead. Oh, mega lol. I don't know what that means. All right, there's a
[4295.67s -> 4305.78s]  beer. You ready? I'm gonna do it. Where's that maintenance room? It's like right here somewhere.
[4305.78s -> 4336.58s]  Don't accidentally drink it. That kind of looks like fun. You can play these, too. Maybe I should
[4336.58s -> 4349.06s]  play these. Time you've been waiting for. Wait, closed door, closed door, closed door. I know,
[4349.06s -> 4378.71s]  I know. I got it. What a ricochet. What a ricochet. And beer. Here you go. Beer hat. So,
[4380.86s -> 4399.88s]  okay, cool. So who cares? It's kind of cool. Save the game. Straight ahead. I got my beer hat.
[4399.88s -> 4406.78s]  I got everything I need this way. Best healing in the game. Who cares? Is it the best healing
[4406.78s -> 4425.53s]  in the game? How often can I use it? It's going the wrong way. Don't ever use it. Oh shit, I have
[4425.53s -> 4440.66s]  to finish this. I only got five hours until the whole game explodes. How do I get over here?
[4440.66s -> 4461.38s]  Can I not get in there? Fuck. I can't get into that save point from here? There's a tunnel. Oh,
[4461.38s -> 4475.69s]  okay, that way. Anything else over here? Orange juice. I'll take the orange juice. Just in case
[4475.69s -> 4491.00s]  I need it. Softlock Albertson. I have not gotten softlocked once and you know it. A softlock
[4492.17s -> 4496.89s]  would mean that I have to start the game over. I haven't had to start the game over yet.
[4502.97s -> 4518.31s]  I'm fine. All right, the facts. Let's move. This thing's really good for just clearing the path.
[4519.19s -> 4537.13s]  So just bang left. Something you never do. I've only been able to do this with this weapon for
[4537.13s -> 4544.14s]  the last like 20 minutes. And stopping and clearing a path is actually kind of hard because
[4544.14s -> 4547.50s]  you have to, if you have people with you, they just don't listen.
[4551.13s -> 4569.82s]  You want to go through the window? What do you want me to do here, game? Softlock. I have to make
[4569.82s -> 4580.79s]  sure. Not yet. Come onto this. All right, this is it. Harvester. There's another harvester here.
[4581.67s -> 4603.80s]  Uh oh. Military. Goblin mask and battery. Not the best time to tell me all this.
[4605.56s -> 4651.66s]  Wasted. Let's destroy this thing. That gun. Still good. I'm gonna have to use the BFG here.
[4652.70s -> 4656.95s]  Uh oh. Yeah. Okay. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just.
[4670.22s -> 4675.88s]  He's not a Freddy. He's the rope gun.
[4675.88s -> 4700.30s]  Give me that. Uh. Gun on you? It's not very much ammo.
[4711.83s -> 4716.23s]  Warmoot, thanks for the 10 gifted subs. Thank you Warmoot. Sorry, I couldn't really look.
[4717.03s -> 4726.90s]  All right, we're gonna try the hat. Should I drink out of the hat? No, I still have an arch,
[4726.90s -> 4750.86s]  too. I'm free of the slot. Flashlight. Box and nails. Uh. Box and nails and propane tank?
[4751.82s -> 4762.31s]  All right. It's a hazard. I have to. All right, I gotta use it.
[4763.74s -> 4775.22s]  Going this way. Uh. Wait, there's gems right there. This gem's right here. Hold on. Leave me alone.
[4789.94s -> 4821.64s]  Stop coughing. You coughed so long. Light saber. I can't do anything with that. Laser sword and
[4821.64s -> 4829.58s]  blast gun. I know I'm probably getting one guide right now. That's all right. Let's move. I gotta
[4829.58s -> 4846.23s]  move. Facts, facts, facts, facts. I don't have any guns for this. Shit. Um. I'm just gonna avoid
[4846.23s -> 4855.45s]  them. I have to go that way. All right, see if I can do anything about this.
[4866.89s -> 4875.86s]  Fuck. Whoa! Holy shit, you just came out of nowhere. All right, that's actually the best
[4875.86s -> 4905.86s]  thing that could have happened. Fucking aiming. Guy with a gun. All right, we're good. Give me
[4905.86s -> 4943.59s]  your gun. Why are you holding a serving tray? This old gun, right? Give me that. How many more
[4943.59s -> 4965.10s]  of these are there? I tried to aim at you. Okay, I got it when I need it. I'm gonna need it right
[4965.10s -> 4991.64s]  over here. Here we go. I'm gonna line it up. Are they dead? Where's the military? These things?
[4995.72s -> 5019.18s]  I picked up an ice cream. Shit. Okay, I gotta. I want that gun back. All right, my crutch is
[5019.18s -> 5035.35s]  almost gone. Is this thing gone? It is. Go! I got one more shot in this thing. Make it work.
[5046.81s -> 5069.69s]  Did I pass one? Where the fuck did I go? All the way down here. Is that all I can get? Is there a drink
[5069.69s -> 5083.70s]  out of the helmet? It's probably out. No, I have to move. Okay, the thing is actually pretty good.
[5089.29s -> 5098.92s]  Wait, picture! That's not a secret picture or something? How? Is there a save point? Is this
[5098.92s -> 5125.77s]  one straight ahead? Wait! All right, save point. Right in the middle. Hopefully I have enough time
[5125.77s -> 5152.09s]  to do this. Come on. Where are we? Day five. I would say this is the safe one. We'll do this one.
[5152.89s -> 5189.66s]  I don't know. I have items right now. I have the beer hat. That's it. Wasted. Wasted. It's all right.
[5190.06s -> 5195.77s]  I have to get through this. There's some guns up here, definitely. Yeah, I think we can just
[5195.77s -> 5223.16s]  solve like this. Give me the grenade! What happened? Was that a super queen? Was that like an ultra
[5223.16s -> 5243.82s]  queen? Did I throw the grenade? How? Get away from me. There's so many. I need that gun back.
[5244.14s -> 5301.48s]  It's okay. Oh, fuck. No! No! Give me that queen! Okay, 45. Okay, there's still more to do here.
[5301.96s -> 5321.61s]  How the fuck is this possible? There's more of this shit? Oh, man. I need to get that boot over there.
[5322.65s -> 5342.04s]  I got the assault rifle. What do you mean? A dope? What do you mean? A dope? Uh-oh. Oh, shit.
[5342.04s -> 5359.90s]  I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. I need to bring out the thing. No! The queen, quick. She's right
[5359.90s -> 5384.20s]  here. Gun. Defiler. Give me this other queen. How many are there? Uh-oh. Okay. This feels like I'm
[5384.20s -> 5412.90s]  cheating. Who cares? I don't even know what I have for items. Oh, fuck. Okay. Don't puke. Don't puke.
[5413.62s -> 5434.25s]  Another fucking harvesting. Holy shit. That took a million years.
[5435.13s -> 5457.78s]  I'm so glad I did not dick around any longer than that. Well, here's your last harvester.
[5457.78s -> 5472.38s]  Come and get me, you interfering bastard.
[5480.33s -> 5510.28s]  Uh, save the game record. And then I'm gonna go wheelchair. Let's go. What? Get this fucking
[5510.28s -> 5526.09s]  thing out of the way. Get it out of the way. I want to save. Day five, four a.m. Day five,
[5526.09s -> 5533.58s]  twelve. All right. I'm gonna save over this one. No. That. I don't know. This one. This one.
[5555.24s -> 5561.56s]  Sloppy ass fucking thing. Give me a break. That's just so unbelievable. Just drive it.
[5561.56s -> 5571.35s]  Oh, that's what I wanted to do. I want to pick up and push.
[5575.83s -> 5582.47s]  Push the wheelchair. What are you stopping you? I'm so angry. Seriously.
[5583.59s -> 5592.06s]  Well, I just took like three fucking pieces of damage for no reason.
[5594.34s -> 5601.30s]  Place it down. Stand behind it. Circle. Are you in the right? I think you're in the right area.
[5601.86s -> 5627.35s]  Yeah. Okay. Now you can push it. What ride is she on? I don't know. I'm almost out of stuff to eat
[5627.35s -> 5631.11s]  and stuff to drink and stuff to consume. Is she on this ride?
[5639.00s -> 5650.07s]  All right. Just eat here for a second. There's always beer in the beer hat. Yeah, I know,
[5650.07s -> 5656.86s]  but I don't want to like be throwing up. Yes, I was about to eat the spoiled hot dog and then
[5656.86s -> 5670.38s]  I immediately came to the conclusion it was a bad idea. Let's go. Right here?
[5692.34s -> 5702.30s]  Is she going to get into Metal Gear? Yeah. She's going to stand up in a giant.
[5725.43s -> 5738.68s]  Haven't you? You work for Fina Trans. So this is all for what? Money.
[5739.88s -> 5749.05s]  You're even more of an idiot than I thought. This is about saving lives. Saving lives. You
[5749.05s -> 5755.29s]  created a panic to drive up demand. You're missing the point, Frank. This is funny.
[5755.37s -> 5771.64s]  We can't save your precious sombrex without for our country. TK losing the keys. He was
[5771.64s -> 5777.32s]  well paid for giving us access to the cages. His show was going down the tubes anyway,
[5778.04s -> 5786.14s]  which was obvious. He decided to get here. Oh, look at me. Look at me. Make it hard for us to
[5786.14s -> 5795.90s]  finish the job. So what? He dragged you into this? So why didn't he give you up? You think I'm stupid
[5795.90s -> 5805.62s]  enough to deal with an asshole like that myself? But enough talk, Frank. I had a feeling you'd show
[5805.62s -> 5812.07s]  up, so I prepared a little toy for you. I hope I don't have to do this from the very back of that
[5813.35s -> 5830.09s]  last cutscene or whatever. I hope this is the checkpoint. All right. Let's go. Well,
[5830.81s -> 5848.66s]  um, good pick. I got a lightsaber. All right. So let me see. Should I shoot the arm?
[5853.85s -> 5873.59s]  Shoot the eye. Shoot the light. Shoot the eye. Climb anywhere? Maybe just lightsaber the arm?
[5876.22s -> 5879.58s]  Oh, well, you got to take off the armor first. All right. I get it.
[5882.49s -> 5888.55s]  I don't get it, but it's okay. What do we do with the rockets?
[5890.47s -> 5904.70s]  I guess. That's definitely lightsaber. You got to get close and knock off the armor.
[5906.06s -> 5923.61s]  All right. Well, you guys are right. All right. Good. It's going to happen now.
[5931.45s -> 5936.71s]  I don't have any more. You said I had infinite drink. You guys lie to me. I don't have infinite
[5936.71s -> 5966.81s]  drink. Let's get this off. Come on. Still throwing up. I don't have any more heals.
[5966.81s -> 5978.46s]  There's probably heals in like a box, right? There it is. All right. Box looking for heals
[5978.46s -> 5987.85s]  in a box. Great. There's a military crate right here. There's nothing in that. Oh fuck. Yeah,
[5987.85s -> 6017.19s]  there is. Look at this. I don't want to pick up the stools. You still made it through. Get the
[6017.19s -> 6058.30s]  fuck out of here. What's the queen going to do for me right now? Eat that. Oh shit. What's left to
[6058.30s -> 6092.94s]  destroy on your arm? I have no more food. There's nothing in there. There we go. Oh shit. Don't kill
[6092.94s -> 6117.46s]  me. I'm about to run out of time too. Yeah. Okay. So we have to take out the. Where is this? Where's
[6117.46s -> 6130.38s]  this putting me? Why is this putting me all the way back here? The damn game has checkpoints
[6130.38s -> 6135.26s]  everywhere and you wouldn't put one before like the last boss. Why is it? Why is it back here?
[6146.63s -> 6152.63s]  All right. I'm going to keep the gun. The lightsaber is all right. Actually, this is not that bad.
[6154.63s -> 6160.94s]  All right. Shoot off stuff. That's actually, I'm not a terrible visitor. Here we go.
[6161.58s -> 6175.45s]  I understand what happens now. We got to dodge, shoot. Actually, that actually sucks. That really
[6175.45s -> 6193.91s]  sucks. The gun is absolutely pointless. Bring the stool. If the stool works better than the
[6193.91s -> 6248.62s]  lightsaber, I'll be so angry. Do it. Do the angry thing. Bring it down again. Got greedy. Rockets.
[6249.18s -> 6260.17s]  All right. I'm going to stop reading chat because somebody just wrote Wubba lubba dub dub.
[6260.17s -> 6291.30s]  Like that's going to help. That's going to help. Thanks for the help. Swing it down.
[6292.70s -> 6307.02s]  Rockets. What is phase two even going to be? It's kind of like injectors. So lightsaber's almost
[6307.02s -> 6318.63s]  broken. All I have is the defiler after this. Hopefully it can last. Uh oh. All right. Here we
[6318.63s -> 6337.56s]  go. Phase two. Now what? I don't know what that means. Okay. Uh, clap, clamp, clamp, and then
[6337.56s -> 6347.00s]  got it. And then, okay, that's how it goes. It goes clap, clamp, clamp, clamp. I'm so scared to go
[6347.96s -> 6369.62s]  This thing is really fucking slow. Boxes now. Clamp, clamp, clamp, and then the middle.
[6370.34s -> 6384.04s]  Is this thing almost broken too? What? I'm going to have to kill it with a stool.
[6384.76s -> 6402.38s]  Clamp, clamp, in the middle. I hope I can kill this thing with a stool. What if I run out of objects?
[6408.84s -> 6440.22s]  Okay. Dodge. Right in the middle. Clamp, clamp, clamp, middle. Take a picture. Got it. No.
[6446.98s -> 6455.98s]  Shit. I need a new weapon. What's this? I'm trying to take a photo. All right. Give me a stool. Give
[6455.98s -> 6476.78s]  me a stool. Vodka and a stool. Okay. I'm fine. Here it is. It's already broken. Fuck. Is that
[6476.78s -> 6496.14s]  not hurting you? Got it. Oh shit. Oh my God. Okay. I gotta slow down. I'm like panicking for no reason.
[6497.02s -> 6507.58s]  That doesn't hurt you. That doesn't hurt. That doesn't hurt. I just don't ever shoot the gun.
[6507.58s -> 6519.34s]  Another stool. Knife. Stool. Get the fucking stool. Pick it up. I'm almost out of time. I'm
[6519.34s -> 6532.49s]  almost out of time. Time's about to be over. No. God damn it. I'm out of time. Do it. Do it. Do it.
[6532.49s -> 6544.34s]  Do it. Don't. Just please plant down. I need to hit you like three more times. Go down into the
[6544.34s -> 6555.54s]  ground. Oh my fucking God. Go down into the ground so I can hit you. What is it doing? What's going
[6555.54s -> 6582.76s]  on? It's the gun. It's not doing anything. The gun's not doing anything. No. I was literally
[6582.76s -> 6609.24s]  shooting the weak part of the claw and it did no damage. I had an electric stick. The electric
[6609.24s -> 6635.46s]  stick only had... It was red. Did I... Is it gonna lose or what? Okay. Well, that's my ending
[6635.46s -> 6648.25s]  apparently. All right. There's no record of the shelter dwellers having made it out of the city.
[6648.33s -> 6664.02s]  Sure. Reload. Reload it. Of course they give you two stools and a knife. Like there's nothing
[6664.02s -> 6670.90s]  else back there that could be put back there. No. Two stools and a knife. Why is there not
[6670.90s -> 6675.86s]  a fucking like pipe or something? Why is this stool? Why would you put stools back there?
[6675.86s -> 6700.68s]  I can't even skip this. I can't skip this.
[6700.68s -> 6719.86s]  Okay. Let's open it back up. Before I go in there, I'm gonna bring... I'm ditching every gun I have.
[6721.70s -> 6727.26s]  I'm not bringing a single firearm into that fight. I'm gonna bring as many melee weapons as
[6727.34s -> 6734.81s]  possible. They just do so much more damage. He's gotta hit the hand.
[6742.84s -> 6746.76s]  The guns were... Yeah, but why would I bring six guns when they do like...
[6747.56s -> 6754.31s]  They don't do any damage. You see how much damage I was doing with the defiler? That thing was
[6754.31s -> 6767.18s]  taking like fucking 10% per swing, folks. Why wouldn't I just bring like a rake? All right.
[6767.18s -> 6787.75s]  Which one is it? Okay. Give me a fucking rake. Give me... I want a rake? Check this shit out.
[6790.81s -> 6798.26s]  All right. Two by four and a knife. Two by four and a rake. Two by four and a battery.
[6798.82s -> 6804.87s]  Two by four and a lawnmower. But I'm not gonna use that. Just bring the two by four.
[6805.67s -> 6816.15s]  Knife and... I have the lightsaber. I have the defiler. I have this knife. Rake? I think that'd
[6816.15s -> 6824.39s]  be all right. Battery and mask. Head and battery. How do I take the head off? I can't remove my head.
[6828.42s -> 6836.17s]  Rake and battery. Let's try rake and battery. All right. Let's do it.
[6840.31s -> 6845.48s]  All right. Now I'm gonna use this to get there. I'm gonna bring a two by four.
[6846.12s -> 6853.42s]  Just in case. All right. I'm ready. Let's get the hell out of here. I actually know I have
[6853.42s -> 6880.41s]  to walk with this. All right. Fine. Fuck it. Let's go. Rake. Get away from me.
[6881.29s -> 6916.87s]  Ah. All right. Here we are. Same deal. Why are you dropping the rake? Why are you dropping the
[6916.87s -> 6944.73s]  rake? Oh, I jumped and landed and somebody touched my foot. Whoops. Oh my god. It's gone?
[6944.73s -> 6960.68s]  Like, why do you keep doing this to me? Why is he doing that? All right. It's over. Let's go.
[6970.04s -> 6982.36s]  See? Why would I shoot a gun right now? Can you please get up? Leave me alone. Please. Thank you.
[6983.16s -> 7017.86s]  Look at this shit. Are you kidding me? Got it. Taking a broad picture of rake. Hey, we settle down.
[7018.90s -> 7047.24s]  Look at that. Already at phase two. Let's do it. Come on. Clap, clap. Middle. Clap, clap.
[7048.12s -> 7058.95s]  Right there. See how good this is. So good. That's insane. I'm so glad I did not bring any
[7058.95s -> 7077.93s]  guns. Right in the middle. Clap, clap. In the middle. No. Stop. What's this RNG dog doing?
[7101.16s -> 7102.44s]  Oh my god. Do you hear what he just did?
[7112.62s -> 7160.12s]  Do it. It's a gun. Quick. That gun was doing an insane. What do I do? What do I do?
[7161.82s -> 7167.10s]  I have to use a gun. How is this possible without a gun? Just slow down. She's gonna
[7167.10s -> 7179.19s]  bury her head into the ground. Now what? Activate the racket? What the fuck just happened? Why? Did
[7179.19s -> 7197.94s]  I activate missiles? Oh fuck. Fight Stacy. What? Okay. I get it. I get it. I get it.
[7199.98s -> 7209.27s]  I have to get back up there. Okay. That was very fast. Just get up there. What? He's stupid.
[7214.50s -> 7222.46s]  Can I not activate this one? I can't jump over the arm. Wait. Just slow down. Give me the orange juice.
[7223.02s -> 7230.31s]  I'm running out of time. I have about like 12 minutes.
[7240.70s -> 7249.40s]  Okay. Fight Stacy. Let's go. Let's go. Please.
[7252.36s -> 7271.14s]  Activate it. Okay. Here we go. It's a good thing she's an idiot. Oh god. Did I lock it?
[7271.14s -> 7280.42s]  I think it's locked. I can't do anything anymore. I think it's over.
[7284.41s -> 7289.45s]  Do I have to go to the other one? This is fucking outrageous, man.
[7304.04s -> 7312.26s]  Coming? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I have to halt. I have to stop. Pause the game. Pause the game.
[7312.42s -> 7318.10s]  Pause the game. Pause the game. I have to do this again. It's all right. The rake is
[7324.74s -> 7332.23s]  phase three. Oh my fucking god. The rake was perfect. Just use the rake and then you have
[7332.23s -> 7358.87s]  to jump from platform to platform and activate the fucking terminal. God damn it. I blame everybody
[7358.87s -> 7365.83s]  that told me I'm to make the hack because I'm just drinking booze and it's fucking ruining
[7365.83s -> 7375.86s]  everything. All right. Let's go. Rake. Fast. Nothing matters. I only need a rake. Rake and
[7375.86s -> 7387.45s]  battery. Let's go. Save time. That's the only item that matters. Check it out. Watch this.
[7388.09s -> 7396.89s]  Save the game right now. Please get the beard trimmer out of the way. We're going to slot one.
[7396.89s -> 7404.06s]  Let's go. Why save? So I don't have to make this ever again.
[7404.94s -> 7429.38s]  Two fucking stun mechanics in games like these make me want to puke blood. Just reload. Just
[7429.38s -> 7461.00s]  reload the goddamn game. This is unbelievable. I could drown myself back in this. There's a zombie
[7461.00s -> 7465.24s]  on top of me and I think I take more damage when a random person swipes at me running through the
[7465.24s -> 7488.47s]  crowd. Why is it like this? Here comes a 45 minute sex scene. There are no sex scenes.
[7489.43s -> 7498.25s]  There's no shame in restarting with my current level. That would be a really good idea if
[7498.25s -> 7511.56s]  I wasn't in the last like 12 minutes of the whole game. If I were to go to the very beginning now,
[7511.56s -> 7517.32s]  oh uh-oh. It wouldn't take that long to rush. No. No, no, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I
[7517.32s -> 7523.35s]  got another mechanic. Pretty clean run by the way. This is a good checkpoint. By the way,
[7523.35s -> 7529.11s]  if it looks like I'm going to lose, I'm just going to quit. Make another rake. I can only
[7529.11s -> 7537.66s]  hold one at a time. If I make a second rake, it's not going to work. I'm going to bypass pretzels.
[7537.66s -> 7570.18s]  I don't need it. Here we go. Clean. For the part here. Good. Missed it. No, I don't need the
[7570.18s -> 7575.37s]  pretzel. I should not take damage in this first phase. Maybe the second one, but not this one.
[7575.93s -> 7599.32s]  That did so much damage that it hurt his hand and he pulled back. Good. Good. Good. I'll get a few
[7599.32s -> 7615.54s]  photos. Don't worry. That bad. Give me that second phase. Give me that second phase.
[7627.30s -> 7647.14s]  Let's go. Nobody touch anything. Good RNG here. I need it. That's not good RNG. It's bad RNG.
[7648.18s -> 7665.18s]  That's also very bad RNG. 50% on the first swing. All right. The rake's almost done.
[7666.06s -> 7682.34s]  It's a toss. Nice. Do it again. Bang, bang, bang.
[7686.39s -> 7695.26s]  Sorry. I'll get it on the next run. One more. All right. One more. And then, oh, good RNG.
[7695.26s -> 7714.87s]  All right. Let's go. Clean. This time, it's a QTE fight. Don't fuck it up.
[7720.36s -> 7746.14s]  Got it. It's okay. I got it, right? QTE. Did I do it? Okay. Let's go. It hurts.
[7748.76s -> 7772.94s]  One more. What do I have for alcohol? No, orange juice. Just take it slow. Orange juice.
[7773.66s -> 7798.97s]  Don't drink any booze. Don't aggro. Okay. Why can I not activate this? What happened?
[7798.97s -> 7833.26s]  All right. Back to one. Back to one. Back to one. Back to one. No soft lock for me.
[7851.00s -> 7855.94s]  I thought I was going to screw that up on that last one. I think that's kind of scary.
[7856.90s -> 7864.10s]  It's like you're a little out of your league, boy.
[7870.92s -> 7884.42s]  It's Agent S. I'm ready for extraction. Yeah. I just have an old newspaper
[7885.22s -> 7887.06s]  that needs to be taken out to the trash.
[7900.07s -> 7903.91s]  That's such an anticlimactic way to die in a game like this. It's just like,
[7904.55s -> 7913.88s]  no, you're just instantly dead. Dead, dead, dead.
[7926.90s -> 7936.38s]  Wait. What do you mean before the firebombing begins?
[7939.22s -> 7942.02s]  How many hours are left before the firebomb begins?
[7942.02s -> 7947.35s]  Okay. I thought I had to get to the roof again.
[7986.70s -> 8027.37s]  Go get TK. Where is he? Wait, where where's she? Sturned to a zombie?
[8069.30s -> 8086.60s]  What did I just do? I skipped it. Yeah, but I didn't, I didn't think I was going to do that.
[8087.64s -> 8097.14s]  Did I skip the cutscene too? No, no, we're here.
[8130.89s -> 8131.61s]  She's alive.
[8151.22s -> 8156.58s]  Is this a dig at the first game having like a gigantic fetch question in the game?
[8165.34s -> 8173.38s]  Compromising photo. Oh man, look at all this shit. All right, it's pee time. I gotta get up a
[8173.38s -> 8178.92s]  stretch. I'm gonna pee. I'll be back in like two or three minutes. Stretch your legs. You'll be
[8178.92s -> 8340.92s]  right back for overtime. So instead of doing overtime, I was probably, I was thinking about,
[8342.04s -> 8347.66s]  thinking of going back to the save where I lost Juan and just going from there. I felt kind of
[8347.66s -> 8354.84s]  really bad about it. I missed core, during that little final boss there, core monster gave 20
[8354.84s -> 8363.18s]  community subs. Thank you for this huge sub drop core monster. I missed it, but just touch upon it
[8363.18s -> 8377.29s]  now. That's a lot of people. I have plenty of Zombrex, so that's good. You have to do a perfect
[8377.29s -> 8381.69s]  run. There's no way I'm doing that. All right, so let's go. Zombrex stat. I'm gonna go,
[8383.94s -> 8393.77s]  uh, start on the top right. Start over here at, uh, painkillers. Yeah, I'm gonna go all the way
[8393.77s -> 8400.58s]  around. Oh, what's the one right next to me here? We'll go this way. Find the compromising photo.
[8401.30s -> 8419.69s]  Let's do it. What? Okay, that was strange. That was very weird. So what does it look like now
[8419.69s -> 8435.30s]  outside? I'm so happy. Dead Rising 1. Overtime. True ending. Dead Rising 2. Overtime. True ending.
[8435.30s -> 8461.43s]  No resets. Time? Yeah, I'm just, I'm going for it. Are they military everywhere like
[8461.43s -> 8467.56s]  that wasn't the first one? There's only one reason why I would be upset at this game,
[8467.56s -> 8472.92s]  and it would be if it was just a cop, just a carbon copy of Dead Rising 1 when it was just
[8472.92s -> 8489.54s]  people's. Okay. It's not, I don't think it is. I can still gamble too. Maybe kind of compromising
[8489.54s -> 8495.50s]  photo. Where is it? Okay.
[8519.51s -> 8526.28s]  Wait, what, what the hell was that? All right, let's go to Zombrex Stash. That's the next one,
[8526.28s -> 8537.38s]  right? Where is this one? Is it up? It's down. Okay. It's in the garage. Underground tunnels.
[8548.42s -> 8562.30s]  Check the photo. Yeah, I haven't looked at the photos in a long time. This one sucks. This one
[8562.30s -> 8579.99s]  really sucks. Oh, right. That's one. I almost threw like a grenade at these two. Who's standing
[8579.99s -> 8585.34s]  there? All right. I like that. Strange. Whose boobs are these? No, that's okay. That's the bum.
[8585.98s -> 8592.76s]  I don't know why I took a photo of this. Half of these are just on accident.
[8592.76s -> 8614.34s]  I never got rid of the snipers either. Oh, that's important. This one, is this one saved? Wait,
[8614.34s -> 8635.59s]  I'm sharing these. I don't want to share them. I just want to lock them. This one sucks. This
[8635.59s -> 8640.54s]  one sucks. Oh, that. I was trying to throw it at it and hit her in the head and right when I hit her,
[8640.54s -> 8646.63s]  take the picture. That one sucks. That would've, but it was a good one before when you got run
[8646.63s -> 8659.53s]  over by the thing. These are just like, I need to get rid of them. Okay. The people hugging photos
[8659.53s -> 8675.59s]  just don't need to be saved. Okay, cool. Zombrich stash. He hates when people are in love.
[8677.35s -> 8684.62s]  There's no reason to have it. Do you guys really think that Disney World keeps all the photos of
[8684.62s -> 8690.30s]  you going down the crest of the roller coaster? No. The second that you don't want to buy it,
[8690.30s -> 8705.62s]  they delete it. Am I not going the right way? What's happening here?
[8706.26s -> 8720.39s]  I am. I'm going the right way, right? Yeah, I gotta go underground. They sell the photos to the
[8720.39s -> 8730.07s]  government. If you really think the government wants you going down Splash Mountain, I mean,
[8730.07s -> 8741.42s]  I don't know what to tell you. Where are they storing all this stuff? So you're telling me
[8741.42s -> 8744.86s]  that the government has a photo of everybody when they've ever gone down Splash Mountain.
[8745.50s -> 8762.62s]  What hard drive is this on? Just Disney photos alone is probably 7,000 to 10,000,
[8762.62s -> 8788.14s]  probably like 55,000 petabytes or something. It's on the cloud. Queen's here. Just give it to me.
[8788.14s -> 8793.82s]  Give it to me. Yes. Oh, man. Oh, man. That's how you get somebody upset.
[8794.94s -> 8799.82s]  That's how you get somebody really upset. This is what just happened right there.
[8800.46s -> 8822.47s]  Look at that car. And imagine being the government employee that goes through those.
[8824.63s -> 8832.60s]  That would be the most boring fucking job ever. It's just going over hundreds of millions
[8833.24s -> 8838.28s]  of going down the Splash Mountain photo. For what? What are you storing them for?
[8841.74s -> 8864.98s]  What would you have to have that for? For face recognition. I mean, it's fun for the police.
[8864.98s -> 8876.58s]  Wait, what? We're going to get the staff. I grabbed again. I swear I need to heal now, too.
[8885.59s -> 8914.38s]  Oh, it's in the train. I can't just climb this. I know I'm going to puke. That's good.
[8915.26s -> 8919.66s]  I kind of don't need this magazine anymore. It's useless to me.
[8920.30s -> 8923.50s]  I dropped the helmet. Yeah, because I puked and I don't want it anymore.
[8942.97s -> 8952.50s]  Trans left a nice little gift basket. What do you guys think your CIA profile looks like in the
[8952.50s -> 8959.75s]  photo regard? Do you really think there really just is like 600,000 photos of you? Imagine getting
[8959.75s -> 8967.46s]  that like on the drive. They're just like here. Here's every photo. It's just you walking down
[8967.46s -> 8979.34s]  some street. Cut his mic. No, keep my mic on. Where do I need to go? I need a car or something.
[8979.82s -> 9009.21s]  Car, motorcycle. Grab me right now. You guys just extra grabby. Oh, for the love of God,
[9009.21s -> 9014.41s]  just kill them. They're not going to stop. They're never going to stop. So why not just get rid of
[9014.41s -> 9058.46s]  them? I hate it. He hates it. He does. He does hate it. I got it. Don't worry. Okay. I'm just
[9058.54s -> 9106.33s]  making sure I'm going the right way. Did GPS freak the fuck out? I got it. Oh yeah. I'm ready. And
[9108.76s -> 9116.92s]  amplifier and gun. Amplifier and flashlight. Amplifier and defiler. Amplifier and beer.
[9116.92s -> 9136.34s]  Amplifier and this thing. Nope. I don't have the BFG. No, I don't. Sad. Motor oil. I never
[9136.34s -> 9148.55s]  use this for anything. What should I do with this? Drink it. You can't drink motor oil.
[9151.29s -> 9166.94s]  You should check the combo page in all caps. There's a lot of info here. Money. What else
[9166.94s -> 9175.19s]  can I do with the computer? I don't see motor oil anywhere. There's no motor oil on this list.
[9175.83s -> 9196.68s]  So the person that screamed at me, I'm going to scream back. Spray paint and knife. Eh,
[9197.32s -> 9216.87s]  another handgun. All right. I'm going to waste one of these. Handgun and spray paint.
[9229.82s -> 9238.06s]  Pipe and what am I looking for now? Right here. All right. Expensive champagne.
[9272.63s -> 9311.67s]  Turn off the face cam. I don't have one on. Wait. Orange juice and beer. Nectar. Orange juice,
[9311.67s -> 9316.90s]  orange juice. No. Is that a waste? I feel like I want these orange juice. No, whatever.
[9319.88s -> 9329.05s]  I need this spray paint. Just cover yourself in paint.
[9340.31s -> 9351.38s]  Beard. Double beard. I can't fucking believe my just drank that. I was trying to punch you.
[9352.66s -> 9356.34s]  Flip it. I want you to clip that. Clip that because it was nothing in my tray.
[9356.34s -> 9360.26s]  Flip it. Go look at it. Go look at it. I want to punch this guy. There was nothing in the image
[9360.26s -> 9385.51s]  right. Go clip it. I want you to look at it. I can't put a coin in there. All right. Get me out of
[9385.51s -> 9394.87s]  this. Wait. There's a beer. Beer and vodka. Let's do it. Nectar and queen. I can't put
[9394.87s -> 9405.18s]  queen in there. Nectar and queen. Wait. Let me flush this out. Let me flush this out first.
[9414.38s -> 9422.36s]  Okay. So that's randomizer. All right. Nectar and queen. If I do this and it's wrong,
[9422.36s -> 9428.33s]  I'm not going to scream for two months. Okay. Are you sure you want me to do this still?
[9435.42s -> 9441.69s]  Good. You can't. You can't even put the queen in there. See. In two months.
[9443.21s -> 9449.64s]  Look at all these fucking handguns. All right. I don't even need this anymore.
[9451.26s -> 9468.42s]  I've been holding on to it for no reason. Sounds like a shotgun though. I have to redo this.
[9469.78s -> 9475.13s]  Stupid idiot meat on bone. Stupid idiot meat on bone. Meat on bone. Meat on bone. Meat on bone.
[9475.85s -> 9493.78s]  Stupid idiot meat on bone. Stupid idiot meat on bone. I'm just trying. Oh, there's the expensive
[9493.78s -> 9516.74s]  one. Okay. Should I do one more? Yeah. I'm going to do one more time and I'm going to replace
[9517.86s -> 9541.83s]  the queen. Queen and nectar at work bench. All right. I'll do queen and nectar at the work
[9541.83s -> 9546.07s]  bench. If it's not real, I'm not going to scream for like six years. I'm just going to come back
[9546.07s -> 9559.98s]  when I'm like 45. Be like, remember me? I really got you right chat. Okay. Give me that clean back.
[9559.98s -> 9567.02s]  I'm going to replace the, this thing's pretty much toast anyways. So fuck it. Give me the queen.
[9568.06s -> 9584.82s]  Let's go workshop. There's a bunch on the way, but wait, this tube right in front of me.
[9585.46s -> 9591.40s]  Let's go get, okay. We got, that's going to be last. Let's go get,
[9592.71s -> 9595.67s]  let's go get men's silk thong and then come back and do the other ones.
[9600.86s -> 9603.98s]  And anybody that like disagrees with what I'm saying is getting a timeout.
[9611.82s -> 9619.10s]  If I swing and miss and I don't hit a zombie and you say, like you swung and missed LOL,
[9619.10s -> 9646.94s]  timeout. I can't talk. This thing's pretty much done. Let's do a grenade. Fine. Yeah, sure. Boom.
[9649.21s -> 9658.18s]  I didn't get a chance to see it. Let's go.
[9663.11s -> 9674.10s]  Did you guys watch the stream? If I was constantly like this, like this, ready? Like,
[9676.09s -> 9681.50s]  no, no, no, shut the fuck up. Let's just shut the fuck up. The next person that says anything
[9681.50s -> 9705.48s]  like that. I'm going to go guys. Shut up guys. Stop, stop, stop. I swear to God, I hate you guys.
[9705.56s -> 9719.70s]  What if I was like that? Are people like that? Yeah. Well now you have forever.
[9721.14s -> 9736.57s]  Anytime I get frustrated in the game or I get mad about something, I never want to get like actually
[9737.69s -> 9744.26s]  like, the stream is ruined to angry. You know what I mean? Cause there's a certain line where
[9744.26s -> 9761.42s]  you just are so upset that like the stream is ruined and your day is ruined. Mario tennis.
[9761.42s -> 9770.92s]  Oh, it's upstairs. Yeah. I think I've allowed one in five years of streaming.
[9772.22s -> 9775.34s]  I'm not allowed one stream where I'm like fucking stupid, fucking games,
[9775.34s -> 9779.90s]  fucking stupid, dumb fucking idiot. Fucking game is stupid. I'm not allowed one of those.
[9792.89s -> 9798.23s]  Ooh, you didn't use it. No, I didn't.
[9798.23s -> 9812.47s]  All right. So that gives us that. Let's move. Uh, what's faster? What do you think?
[9816.22s -> 9819.58s]  These two last. Yeah. We'll go down to the uh, sutures.
[9821.74s -> 9827.42s]  Change mask, please. Fucking not change my fucking mask. Fucking stupid fucking thing.
[9827.58s -> 9846.06s]  He's not even trying to string together a sentence. Just saying, just being angry and saying swears.
[9846.06s -> 9851.90s]  Come on over the top. I can't throw him over the top rope. What we got here? Randomizer.
[9851.90s -> 9868.65s]  Let's see what it does. What does it do? Nothing. Just pew. Nothing. Stupid. Fucking dumb.
[9877.99s -> 9887.10s]  We've talked about it a million times before, but there's always a way you can tell when somebody's
[9887.10s -> 9894.06s]  really mad. Instead of talking like this, they drop the voice down like this and they talk kind
[9894.06s -> 9898.87s]  of fast and they just fucking say like this is fucking stupid. I'm not even, this is like seriously
[9898.87s -> 9904.39s]  fucking dumb. You drop down to like normal I'm talking on the phone voice with like,
[9905.59s -> 9915.24s]  no, you wouldn't be like that mad. Who are you that mad at? You're like really, really angry with
[9915.24s -> 9933.64s]  somebody on the phone. What is this? Spin the wheel. Should I do the wheel? Spin the wheel.
[9934.12s -> 9948.66s]  A thousand bucks. It's $25,000 to spin this again. Oh my goodness. I keep talking over and over and
[9948.66s -> 9963.72s]  over again. Let's spin the wheel and see what's going on with all my money. I'm not sure that's
[9963.72s -> 9983.16s]  gonna happen. Yikes. Is this one super defense? The queen. No, no, no. If I use the queen, so
[9983.16s -> 9986.84s]  when people are gonna write stupid fucking dumb fucking idiot, I'm telling you, I'm not supposed
[9986.84s -> 10003.88s]  to do it. I lost. I lose again. How do you win? I wish I could just play this. You know, I really
[10003.88s -> 10009.64s]  wish I could just play this. Instead of being cough, stun locked. I wish I could just play that.
[10013.51s -> 10034.18s]  I need a weapon. Something that's not a serving tray. This should be a fucking internal clock
[10034.18s -> 10045.34s]  that like you can't talk more than once every 20 seconds. Do you upset me? I don't know. I'm
[10045.34s -> 10060.70s]  just going. This is ridiculous. Look at how long that lasts. It's a full five seconds.
[10061.50s -> 10072.42s]  Fucking dumb fuck. Fucking, fucking thin. I'm using a toy and it's almost broken.
[10074.92s -> 10093.10s]  It comes with throw up. Don't do it. Can I have them? Just go over here and go in the maintenance
[10093.10s -> 10116.73s]  room. Okay guys, see you in three months. Nope, I get a stream. Wingman. Wicked. What does it do?
[10117.53s -> 10140.42s]  Where is it? Is it the first one? Unleash this ruthless wasp against the zombie menace.
[10144.02s -> 10157.42s]  So it's just a, why is this in here? An oil? What does this do? Sword, training sword and oil.
[10158.06s -> 10170.52s]  Ready to rumble. Well, that's awesome. I'm going to hold on to that. Brum and is there a machete
[10170.52s -> 10185.29s]  you're on? Brummin something else. Maybe. I just drank the thing. I need a good, thank God. There's
[10185.29s -> 10196.50s]  one right here. This is a good one. I already have one of these. I have two. I'm not even using them.
[10199.96s -> 10210.12s]  Zombrex. Almost didn't do it. Oh my God. That would have been so funny. All right. It's gonna be a brum.
[10210.84s -> 10223.93s]  Get it out. Then we go all the way out and around. Is there a safe point in here? No,
[10223.93s -> 10238.81s]  it's out this way. Okay. I have a weapon. Y'all better run. Think of the funny drama that I find
[10238.81s -> 10269.56s]  moment. There's a rocket launcher. What? Where's there a rocket launcher? Liar. Where? Oh, no lies
[10269.56s -> 10281.99s]  here. Not a liar. It's a good trait. I'm gonna take the sword too. And I'm getting rid of the hat.
[10286.26s -> 10297.34s]  Take a sip and then get rid of it. No, I want to throw it. Okay. Give me my, I've got my sword. I've
[10297.34s -> 10312.23s]  got my rocket launcher. Let's move. 100 in here. This game is sick. Seriously, this game is sick.
[10313.19s -> 10319.48s]  Would you guys still stay here and watch it? I, all right, let's find out. I'm curious.
[10320.20s -> 10335.58s]  Game's fucking sick.
[10385.35s -> 10421.26s]  I was gonna say, somebody said in the chat, I was gonna go, y'all, this is dope. That's it.
[10429.62s -> 10437.14s]  All right, we need gauze. Save it. Do a rocket jump? No, that'd be cool if we could.
[10438.20s -> 10457.82s]  Dynamite. Not bad. Not bad.
[10488.33s -> 10503.05s]  Am I stuck in here? I just look over and I see that now. I can't get out of this. I really can't
[10503.05s -> 10529.13s]  leave with this. Can I throw it? Nope. Throw backwards like this. Throw it. Why won't he throw
[10529.13s -> 10560.62s]  it now? It's getting fucking dope. Come on. Is that close enough? That guy. All right. I'm
[10560.62s -> 10581.72s]  getting real sick of this thing. Give it to me. Why can't, okay. Sick. That's annoying. That's
[10581.72s -> 10590.60s]  annoying. Why can't I get this out of here? Sorry, I went down into the waterfall thing.
[10593.10s -> 10614.81s]  Didn't mean to. I do want this gun. If I don't. I jumped into that guy's arm. That's how you know
[10614.81s -> 10620.41s]  it stinks like a turd. When I jump into the guy's hands. Like he was waiting for me to jump.
[10621.53s -> 10648.26s]  All right, they both right over here. I'm gonna go read a book. This is too sick.
[10649.38s -> 10655.66s]  I hope the book is good. What is the book? You can't leave without saying the book. Title.
[10656.38s -> 10683.38s]  Plus the title. Let's go. Flashlight in case I find gems.
[10698.78s -> 10709.27s]  Save this guy. What was the point of saving this person? I could have given that Zombricks to the
[10709.27s -> 10728.74s]  whole lady. Not very big brained of you. What books do I read? I like to have a certain amount
[10728.74s -> 10738.66s]  in my possession at all times. Sunday morning cartoon pages. The Bazooka Joe bubblegum.
[10743.06s -> 10753.98s]  The back of the glade when I'm taking a shit. What else do we got?
[10762.10s -> 10777.99s]  Anything that has ingredients in it? The newspaper. If the newspaper was still
[10777.99s -> 10787.37s]  cold I would get it and read it on the toilet. This is not. I don't like the way a newspaper feels.
[10789.88s -> 10793.64s]  When you pick up a newspaper and you touch it and you it's like a sandy weird
[10794.84s -> 10807.62s]  awful feeling on your hands. I hate it. You can almost feel the ink kind of coming off. It's
[10808.18s -> 10811.46s]  uh I really don't like it. It's a weird thing that I don't like.
[10813.14s -> 10818.57s]  Yes I also don't like the sound of tape being pulled and I don't like popping balloons.
[10821.18s -> 10836.60s]  Hey you found a real weird one. Return to the arena.
[10839.96s -> 10860.92s]  Now let's try this again. Just was not meant to be. Ever. Where did my sword go? The cool one.
[10871.66s -> 10878.38s]  He swung and you missed. It's all right. Boomerang plus knight makes a boomerang knight.
[10885.10s -> 10904.68s]  I got it. That guy's dead. Boomerang knight. Uh can I get a couple uh can I get a couple of
[10904.68s -> 10923.78s]  hyucks in the chat please for the boomerang knife that somebody just said? I don't want to break it.
[10923.78s -> 10945.32s]  Last opportunity I'm gonna get to do the 25th of 10 000. Can I do it again? Let's see if I can do
[10945.32s -> 10973.64s]  it. 25 grand. Now I did it. Didn't I have a weapon? Oh that guy got faced. That guy was not even
[10973.64s -> 10976.60s]  paying attention. He was looking at his fingernails and he's still instagramming.
[10987.82s -> 11002.31s]  Instagram? Is that what I said? I did not say Instagram. Don't forget to save.
[11004.15s -> 11027.93s]  That person just saved the whole stream. Seriously. If you don't think so look it up. I go on the
[11027.93s -> 11045.34s]  wrong one every time. No German. No no no no. Let me know. 5 20 12 52 2 a.m. This one right here.
[11047.02s -> 11067.61s]  Turn on your face cam. You don't need a face cam. It's not necessary. Give us content. It's not
[11067.61s -> 11078.39s]  necessary. I need a face cam and like oh and like it'll be called face cam fridays. Remember that
[11078.39s -> 11087.58s]  was a big deal. I used to have a series on youtube called face cam fortress because that was a big
[11087.58s -> 11096.02s]  deal to have your face cam turned on during the game. I know a lot of you are laughing right now.
[11096.02s -> 11118.02s]  This was like 2011. 2012. That was a big deal back in 2011. Wait wow you can actually do that.
[11118.58s -> 11126.66s]  Pretty sick. Arena time.
[11150.81s -> 11160.66s]  Where's Darth Vader? I can't even say it. Where's Darth Vader?
[11163.94s -> 11164.66s]  Start what?
[11193.64s -> 11198.92s]  I just came to the stream and I don't understand this like my weapon writing number is minus two
[11198.92s -> 11201.80s]  plus two. Like I don't fucking get this stupid fucking thing. It's fucking dumb.
[11203.40s -> 11205.72s]  Why don't I just chat? I'm fucking the stream is fucking dumb.
[11207.72s -> 11233.78s]  All right survive. I don't have any weapons. Climb up there. Climb over and kill him immediately.
[11236.10s -> 11270.10s]  Coughed. He pre-coughed. He pre-coughed on me. I'm oh it walls up. This is my like worst nightmare.
[11270.10s -> 11292.78s]  Just being surrounded by these things. I'm gonna fucking believe. Why would I drink that up here?
[11293.66s -> 11296.94s]  I don't know what's going on with my mind. Why would I drink that up there?
[11297.58s -> 11304.46s]  I'm so angry about fucking coughing that it's it's malting me. I'm malting. Not malting. I'm
[11304.94s -> 11334.81s]  gonna drop my skin. I need a weapon. Stop coughing when you get up on top. Oh my god. What is that?
[11334.81s -> 11349.91s]  Oh my fucking god. Right? I'm not saying that. This is the last time you're gonna hear me say
[11350.55s -> 11367.94s]  oh my fucking god. What the hell is that? What the hell?
[11369.14s -> 11411.64s]  Oops. Perfect timing. Come on. Activate. Activate. You have to escape? No it said survive. Five
[11411.64s -> 11417.50s]  thousand bits from David. Saved it. Thank you for the five thousand bits of German. Why are you
[11417.50s -> 11427.72s]  being so mean to me? You're making me cry. David. You're fucking sick. You're the best.
[11428.52s -> 11441.22s]  Final fight with TK. But thank you David. Thanks for the fifty dollar. That's a lot of money.
[11441.22s -> 11453.00s]  Five thousand bits. I'll drink to that. Jesus.
[11466.68s -> 11467.32s]  Where's the checkpoint?
[11478.41s -> 11479.37s]  What a bad photo.
[11481.93s -> 11490.49s]  That would have been so good. He docked again in the worst possible time. What's wrong with Rebecca?
[11496.39s -> 11524.17s]  Stop the bleeding. This won't be hard for me. You know how I do. Rebecca I'm sorry. All I have
[11524.17s -> 11533.22s]  are pretzels and snacks. Devators you have like a fucking scepter that activates the ground.
[11534.10s -> 11564.58s]  This probably looks bad to Rebecca. Like holy shit dude. Like you can't handle this. Watch out for
[11564.58s -> 11571.27s]  fire. Let's go get it. All right. Do you have anything else besides like nails and orange juice?
[11585.42s -> 11599.30s]  I'm trying to get like something out of the box. What is this? I just need weapons.
[11600.26s -> 11604.42s]  Cement saw. Okay finally. I just threw it over the cliff.
[11644.09s -> 11670.33s]  Wrench. How did I miss? He's dead? Is he dead? Why would he do that?
[11670.33s -> 11680.86s]  All right he's a big wave. All right I need to heal. That's not a heal. How do you avoid that shit?
[11680.86s -> 11706.63s]  I need to heal. Heal. Heal. I can't. I can't. I can't do it. I need more healing. Oh he's gonna
[11706.63s -> 11712.70s]  activate the shit. How do you blithely get over here without getting killed?
[11715.08s -> 11727.59s]  Orange juice. I don't have. I know but fuck. Oh no I can see it but he blows the shit up.
[11728.55s -> 11764.52s]  Oh they're gonna hit Rebecca. How do I prevent it from activating this stuff over here?
[11765.72s -> 11768.98s]  Like he's just gonna. Here we go. I'm dead. Can I like jump anywhere?
[11774.60s -> 11788.66s]  At least I got to taste it before I died. Okay I wonder if there's a. Do I have. How do I.
[11789.46s -> 11793.93s]  How do I interrupt him from doing that? I have to do that whole thing again.
[11800.23s -> 11806.68s]  So aggravating. I have to do the whole arena thing just to stand around arena thing again.
[11807.08s -> 11823.88s]  I'm so. I'm so. I'm so mad by this. That it's making me go the wrong way. So before I fought
[11823.88s -> 11831.11s]  that guy somebody said this is the worst boss in the game. I can see why. Not because of how
[11831.11s -> 11835.75s]  how hard he is to fight but because I have to do this again. Does anybody know where that guy was?
[11837.32s -> 11857.83s]  Where the fuck was that guy? He was over there. God damn it. All right I'm gonna start to save
[11857.83s -> 11862.31s]  this stuff. I'm gonna try to hold on to as many weapons as I can. I'm just gonna jump around.
[11862.31s -> 11865.03s]  I'm not gonna fight anything. Save the pretzels. Save the food.
[11866.65s -> 11872.07s]  Save the bat too. I'm gonna try to see if I can get through this without. Oh I forgot the coffin
[11872.07s -> 11878.71s]  exists in this game. Delete the coffin. Right now like the developers of this game like play this
[11878.71s -> 11890.41s]  back and they go fuck man we should never play this like that. Hope nobody notices. Come on.
[11891.29s -> 11905.59s]  Come on. What a great start.
[11907.75s -> 11918.47s]  You never know if I just have to activate this like three times or something.
[11918.47s -> 11980.50s]  It's just a time limit. Let's see if it's time. Saw saw saw saw saw saw. I'm in trouble.
[11981.54s -> 12012.65s]  I'm in trouble. I didn't even want to fall off. That's three times. It's not three times. It's
[12012.65s -> 12023.29s]  just time. Oh ladies and gentlemen for the worst checkpoint. I don't want to do this again. I have
[12023.29s -> 12029.05s]  to win. I don't want to do this again. I'm not doing this a third time. No human wants to do
[12029.05s -> 12042.54s]  this for like a second or third time. I know there's like computer programs that like that
[12042.54s -> 12053.69s]  to do this. I don't want to do that. Okay I still have not. I don't understand how
[12053.69s -> 12063.86s]  this works. Because when you go too far away. Watch that.
[12066.82s -> 12090.81s]  Why is he not getting hurt by that? Pick up the fucking orange juice.
[12091.61s -> 12127.03s]  Stop tilting. He comes over and does that? Why didn't that hit him? Okay let's run around the
[12127.03s -> 12149.30s]  circle until you. I need to heal Rebecca. There he goes. Does he run to the wall? Is this like a
[12149.30s -> 12179.50s]  Mario game? Get over here so I can heal her. Just like taunt or something. How am I supposed to
[12179.50s -> 12224.38s]  keep her healed when he never lets up the pressure? Heal? Oh my god. Oh no don't let him kill you.
[12224.38s -> 12247.10s]  Don't let him kill you Jeremy. Don't let him do it. He's gonna try. Fuck that move.
[12248.06s -> 12296.94s]  Ay yi yi he's gonna run. I just got mortal combated. All right. Mortal combat 2. Great.
[12316.09s -> 12324.26s]  Should I just drink a bunch of shit? Just use the queen so we can see what it does.
[12325.06s -> 12329.90s]  God I don't even have the queen anymore. All right let's do it.
[12330.62s -> 12356.26s]  That is as effective as an attack fly from binding advisor. You don't throw it.
[12358.46s -> 12361.90s]  What else do you do? All right I'm gonna drink this and run in. Drink up all.
[12375.77s -> 12392.23s]  What is it? Nothing? I only got the painkiller. Is this last? I guess it works.
[12392.95s -> 12435.06s]  Get this shit before we go up. No why did you jump that way?
[12435.94s -> 12452.41s]  Okay. Okay. Get this queen? Holy shit kill everybody. I mean besides the camera freaking
[12452.41s -> 12460.55s]  me out here. Is the camera broken right now? I think it is. Maybe not. Am I out of my mind?
[12460.55s -> 12467.13s]  We're getting to wrestler levels of I was waiting for you to do that and we both knew
[12467.13s -> 12469.05s]  at the same time you're moving to jump with my heart.
[12497.38s -> 12520.63s]  Why puke? I didn't drink anything. Line him up. My baseball bat. Give me like the beer. Give the
[12520.63s -> 12558.41s]  bat. What else is over here? Anything? Any secret items? Special items? Queen? I need the bat.
[12558.97s -> 12589.22s]  Let me try this again. God damn. All right gotta hit him with the bat and then he'll run away.
[12589.86s -> 12615.51s]  I'm cocky with this shit. This thing's freaking me out. Get away from me B.
[12629.05s -> 12656.28s]  No! Rebecca please move your head. I want the snack. Why do you gotta do it like that? I'm standing
[12656.28s -> 12667.83s]  in front of it. You have to make it so messy. I want that not the three boxes surrounding it.
[12667.83s -> 12678.12s]  How is that so hard to understand? It just it like cycles through all of them in a half a second.
[12678.12s -> 12731.40s]  It's like just fucking stay on one of them. Molding! I didn't stop halfway. Where'd it go?
[12731.96s -> 12745.21s]  Holy shit! No!
[12751.24s -> 12774.20s]  Run away. Give me that health. Come on run away. Are you? I got baited. Are you what? Are you
[12774.20s -> 12811.83s]  kidding me? Are you fucking serious? Why is he not running away? Are you serious? Are you serious?
[12822.70s -> 12834.34s]  They're dead. I'll be back in Dead Rising 3.
[12849.70s -> 12855.26s]  Hey what do you say? Break the story.
[12861.27s -> 12867.11s]  Doesn't that exact same? That was just Sonic the Hedgehog 2006. Doesn't that happen? That's like
[12867.11s -> 12872.23s]  ice. There's a frame from that. That's Sonic the Hedgehog 2006. Nice try. I mean nice try for a
[12872.23s -> 12890.81s]  jump scare but he almost got me. That's the car commercial thing. Almost. Long time for that one.
[12891.53s -> 12927.21s]  Monsters Inc theme song. That was good. It was constant conflict in the chat before I picked
[12927.21s -> 12933.69s]  that in this game and sometimes constant conflict is you know I'm not even going to try it. Well I
[12933.69s -> 12978.58s]  even bring it up. There's no reason to say that you were going to do Dead Rising 2 after this.
[12980.38s -> 12986.30s]  That may have been a rage statement. Was it? All right let me ask you a question. Before I said that
[12986.30s -> 12992.62s]  did I just get grabbed by a zombie or was that potentially like the fourth retry of a boss?
[12993.50s -> 13014.54s]  Are we sure? Why did they say that? Was it like a quell? I think that may have been a
[13014.54s -> 13026.17s]  quell the audience state. No I'm not going to stream Dead Rising again tomorrow. Four hours?
[13026.65s -> 13039.86s]  Let me see what else there is to do. 10 of the last like 11 streams.
[13041.30s -> 13048.49s]  They're very good. They're fun. I know you can't know what I'm saying. You know what this music
[13048.49s -> 13063.74s]  sounds like so let's just turn it off. Hi. I think you can hear me now. So yeah I'm not doing like
[13064.46s -> 13076.97s]  10 out of 11 streams of Dead Rising 3. I do want to play Dead Rising 3 just not right now.
[13080.34s -> 13093.45s]  Maybe like in December. Somewhere. We'll put it somewhere. I promise. He's never going to
[13093.45s -> 13110.14s]  play it? Yeah yes I am. I said I was never going to play four. All right is there any after credit
[13110.14s -> 13122.17s]  sequences or anything? You said you played Devil May Cry 5. Yeah but in a world where we're spoiled
[13122.17s -> 13128.81s]  rotten with millions of probably video games and I'm counting iOS like trash can stuff too.
[13129.61s -> 13134.57s]  There's like thousands and thousands of great experiences. It's hard to do them all.
[13134.57s -> 13139.37s]  You got to find out when you want to do them. It's hard. I started God of War like two months
[13139.37s -> 13146.25s]  ago or so. I'm like 30% of the way through the game. I can't go back because I just
[13146.25s -> 13151.69s]  were overstimulated with video games now. Like 50 new games come out like every fucking three weeks.
[13153.99s -> 13166.63s]  Oh wait. ADHD? No there's a lot of games. A lot of games. I'm talking even ones that I never
[13166.63s -> 13175.13s]  played before like this. All right I got game ending S. Zombies killed 39. Say that's too bad.
[13175.13s -> 13184.34s]  It's not even 4,000. 25 survivors. 4.3 million dollars. Would you like to save the game? Yes I
[13184.34s -> 13197.06s]  would. What about the new Star Wars game? I don't know. It's too many things. Let's just go with one.
[13198.02s -> 13211.56s]  There are two DLCs. I mean there's DLC for the DLC. Wait start game.
[13212.28s -> 13225.80s]  Anything new? Looks like it's just ending S. Yeah new game sandbox mode. What is sandbox?
[13225.80s -> 13233.26s]  I'm assuming it just doesn't do the sandbox challenge. Do I have to like eat a bowl of
[13233.26s -> 13240.28s]  cinnamon? Right here. Right here. That's it. You too. Thanks man. Appreciate that. Just the two of you?
[13241.74s -> 13244.63s]  Oh all right whatever. You guys are fucking cool.
[13251.78s -> 13260.47s]  There's no time limit. Cray survivors roam the city. What? I'm going back in.
[13261.43s -> 13282.44s]  Play on the last wrong save. Use the existing save. Hold on. Hold on. All right I can't just jump
[13282.44s -> 13298.44s]  off. So load save one? That's not going to show us the credits again? Oh would you look at that?
[13298.52s -> 13306.38s]  You just did. Ah yeah. That's my favorite kind of pasta. Angel hair spaghetti.
[13318.18s -> 13329.54s]  Bad? How could angel hair spaghetti be bad when it's the same fucking thing? It's all the same
[13329.54s -> 13338.18s]  thing. It's just spaghetti. It's just smaller and thinner. It's too thin. No it it you don't I don't
[13338.18s -> 13345.85s]  want I don't want my pasta to soak up all that gross sauce. Angel hair pasta. A little bit of
[13345.85s -> 13355.85s]  butter. A sprinkle of olive oil. That's how they eat it in Italy. And that's how I eat it. I missed
[13355.85s -> 13361.14s]  the fucking first part. What was it? A little bit of olive oil on the pasta. That's how they
[13361.14s -> 13383.70s]  eat it in Italy. Well how do they eat it in Italy? Huh? How do they eat it in Italy? Hey you know
[13383.70s -> 13390.74s]  they made up lasagna for Americans. You know that right? I'm missing important stuff.
[13396.39s -> 13420.09s]  How do Italians eat their food? They relax and socialize while dining for hours.
[13424.26s -> 13429.38s]  Over lunch and dinner and coffee Italians enjoy a diet rich in fruits, vegetables,
[13429.38s -> 13436.02s]  beans, fish, poultry, olive oil, tomatoes, whole grains, dairy, red wine, and they eat very little
[13436.10s -> 13451.08s]  red meat. They dine for hours. Oh it's you. You guys eat too fast. We've already gone over this
[13451.08s -> 13460.71s]  shit man. We don't have to go over this again. Everyone just watch like. Oh it hurts going in.
[13460.71s -> 13476.47s]  Oh okay. Relax have a have a glass of water. Okay here's a challenge. Kill as many zombies
[13476.47s -> 13503.45s]  as you can in 30 seconds. 40 kills? How do I do this this fast? I know I wasted time.
[13503.45s -> 13522.60s]  Fuck it. This is sandbox mode. I just get to let my hair down. My hair. My hair.
[13524.20s -> 13530.30s]  This is actually kind of cool. All right let me try to get it. I gotta get at least 10.
[13530.30s -> 13542.94s]  What's better? Baseball bat's probably better. Go. I'm gonna turn around. Great. I wonder if
[13543.02s -> 13576.17s]  there's a gun or something. Less than last time. I need some. I need a weapon. I need some weapons.
[13576.89s -> 13588.18s]  Something better than what I have. Why did I drink that? I need a tutor.
[13590.76s -> 13599.10s]  Hey that was so funny. I forgot to laugh. That's such an old saying but that makes it. How does
[13599.10s -> 13615.93s]  it make any sense? That was so funny I forgot to laugh. Is there a grenade? No. Because you
[13615.93s -> 13654.62s]  aren't laughing. Why would you forget to laugh? All right so you probably have to come back up
[13654.62s -> 13662.18s]  here with better weapons. 40 people? There's no way that's gonna happen. Not with a wrench.
[13673.72s -> 13689.51s]  I'm almost dead. I forgot. Is there a reason why I don't have a super health? I have to wait to
[13689.51s -> 13693.51s]  go to the main menu and start from the main menu. Not the costume though.
[13693.51s -> 13701.10s]  No. Yeah this is the right save. Otherwise I wouldn't have the costume.
[13703.86s -> 13714.10s]  Right? Yeah. It is know you can jump on the boxes. How did somebody not tell me that?
[13714.74s -> 13736.47s]  It would last like 16 hours of this game. We did. No you didn't. Let's find another challenge.
[13736.47s -> 13740.31s]  I actually kind of like this. This is fun. Plus I'm never playing Dead Rising 2 ever again so
[13740.31s -> 13761.50s]  it doesn't mean. Let's go. A lot of snacks. Who the? Gordon? Gordon what are you doing? What?
[13762.38s -> 13788.23s]  There's a guy just waiting for me. It's Gordon. I feel like I'm playing. Where did he just drop?
[13788.95s -> 13798.15s]  He's got money. All right can you save them? Kill 41 more zombies to unlock this challenge.
[13799.03s -> 13819.38s]  That seems like a lot. I'm immediately playing the original version despite you guys. Is that
[13819.38s -> 13831.40s]  what I said? This doesn't sound like me. I don't know. I feel like that doesn't sound like me.
[13832.20s -> 13838.15s]  Well there's a chain. Okay well let's take the chainsaw upstairs. Wait wait wait wait wait wait.
[13838.15s -> 13850.39s]  Let's do this right. No it's machete and push broom. Yeah and then let's do just give me the
[13850.39s -> 13862.97s]  chainsaw. I'm gonna go back up and use the chainsaw and get 40 kills. Right? I did a second vote but
[13862.97s -> 13873.93s]  I was already in the game and I already bought the damn thing. Damn it. Paddle and chainsaw?
[13874.65s -> 13903.08s]  Does that work? Let's wait till he gets up. Paddle and chainsaw. Did you say palette? Paddle. Where's
[13903.08s -> 13914.02s]  the paddle? Is there a paddle over here? It's paddle on the dumpster. Nice eyes. Nice eyes.
[13914.02s -> 13921.51s]  Seriously. I was away for a while to de-start over it. Yeah I got really really frustrated
[13921.75s -> 13929.43s]  and like I was punching my desk and stuff so I just figured I'd start over. Paddle saw.
[13930.39s -> 13935.72s]  Yeah I know what that does. Hell yeah. I was punching my desk and going
[13939.53s -> 13952.02s]  and fucking tears were just streaming down my face. Should I go back up and just get the 40 one?
[13952.58s -> 13965.14s]  I feel like I can get it easily. Okay it was like screaming and crying.
[13974.89s -> 13983.22s]  It was really really embarrassing and then you heard that.
[13994.68s -> 14021.53s]  40? Let's get it. How many are over here? Come on come on over there. 40. Gold status. I'll take it.
[14021.53s -> 14032.52s]  Why does this guy remind me of Adam Sandler? What are you talking about like 1995 Adam Sandler or
[14032.52s -> 14046.25s]  like 2008 Adam Sandler? Boomstick. Nice. All right cool let's keep going.
[14052.12s -> 14067.00s]  2019 Adam Sandler. I'm not sure I agree. Holy shit.
[14076.25s -> 14080.33s]  I want to do the other challenge. I don't want to use this yet. It's probably killed like 30
[14080.33s -> 14101.50s]  zombies in 20 seconds. Gain as much pp as you can in 60 seconds. It's about to break yeah.
[14102.22s -> 14107.58s]  People saying you gotta go back to the menu and start in the menu.
[14117.16s -> 14123.62s]  Thousand pp. I don't think that's gonna happen.
[14131.77s -> 14149.94s]  That counts? You get a big one. Will all these people count?
[14154.49s -> 14160.76s]  They're not very much. Go back to the challenge area.
[14163.98s -> 14173.40s]  All right I'm gonna start the game from the menu because everyone's telling me that I somehow did
[14173.40s -> 14202.18s]  this wrong. I have the costume now. Why do I have the costume? Sandbox mode.
[14208.33s -> 14218.55s]  You guys you guys thought I got baited? No I did too. I was waiting for it. No that's real.
[14219.19s -> 14225.11s]  Actually you have to start it from the menu. That's the reality. I might be able to do this
[14226.07s -> 14235.69s]  all right hold on. I wonder if I can do it because I'm leveled up. Level 33? Yeah let's try it.
[14247.58s -> 14256.49s]  Yeah that's much better. I might not get 40 but.
[14269.30s -> 14295.14s]  Oh my arms just fell backwards in my chair. Oh without the bat maybe I can't. Yeah I don't
[14295.14s -> 14306.04s]  think I can do it. Sledgehammer? I might be able to spin. What's the spin with a sledgehammer?
[14310.09s -> 14339.64s]  Maybe. Maybe. I'm not turning off my face cam. You want a face cam? No. Nope.
[14349.96s -> 14358.12s]  This is cool. All right I think. I think. I'm gonna. It's losing me a little.
[14359.14s -> 14369.24s]  I'm gonna go down. I'm gonna go down and see. It's losing me. I'm gonna go down here and see if I
[14369.24s -> 14384.66s]  see if it can grab me again. I have to get into where I was before. Let's see. I'm glad for the
[14384.66s -> 14395.67s]  better inventory. Yeah the next game we're playing is Katamari. That's the next up on the list.
[14402.25s -> 14409.35s]  Katamari tonight? Yes. We will at least start Katamari tonight and we'll keep going tomorrow.
[14409.35s -> 14414.57s]  Because I don't. I'm definitely. Oh there's Gordon. Remember Gordon?
[14418.89s -> 14421.24s]  That's good stuff.
[14437.05s -> 14441.48s]  Pig swing. Got you.
[14451.45s -> 14459.82s]  Don't let me do that. Okay 13 more. Let's see. Knife.
[14466.90s -> 14471.70s]  It's starting to lose me. It's losing me. All right 10 more minutes and we'll see where I am.
[14477.66s -> 14491.62s]  No let's see a paddle. Don't play this for 13 more hours. I don't even stream for 13 hours.
[14494.52s -> 14501.42s]  We won Katamari do you? Hold on. Just a minute. I want to try. This is actually really really
[14501.42s -> 14519.26s]  cool though. All right let's go. I beat the game. Got the true ending. Got to overtime. I looked at
[14520.14s -> 14529.16s]  Katamari. Dead Rising 2 off the record was awesome. I suggest you play it. Just trying to get too
[14529.16s -> 14545.78s]  frustrated. I have to switch over to this. This might take a minute. Beautiful Katamari for the
[14545.78s -> 14551.14s]  Xbox 3. That was a fast 10 minutes it was. I got grabbed though and I couldn't handle it anymore.
[14551.14s -> 14566.25s]  It's really easy if you're not an idiot. What is easy? Are you talking to me? Dead Rising 2.
[14570.84s -> 14579.32s]  This game's not easy. I'm sorry. I ain't gonna have somebody with like their fucking
[14580.12s -> 14587.85s]  Boy Scout badges. I beat Dead Rising 2. I get it now too. I get to wear that badge.
[14597.06s -> 14600.50s]  Add it to the gamer license. Yeah I get it. It's a it's point. No I don't want it. I don't want
[14600.50s -> 14626.07s]  points on my license. You didn't 100% it. All right. Okay. Sorry. I'll bring my badge back.
[14626.07s -> 14631.62s]  I'll put it on the table. I beat the DLC and not the main game badge which is harder than the
[14631.62s -> 14647.51s]  original game. Do I get it? Thank you. I beat the hard one. Did you beat the hard one? Not cannon
[14647.51s -> 14655.46s]  points. All right. Let's get let's get on. I could use a different controller.
