[5.11s -> 22.20s]  All right. Okay, everybody settle down. Settle down. Hello. Yeah, and guess what? You can hear me, huh?
[22.20s -> 38.87s]  You can hear me pretty well. Not like it was before. I'm not gonna drink a- hold on. Hey,
[38.87s -> 44.50s]  how you doing? So not like it was before, right? You can actually hear me talking. I've got a little
[44.50s -> 51.19s]  clip here. Previous times I've been in front of the green screen. You couldn't hear a single
[51.19s -> 58.84s]  goddamn thing I was saying. Not this time. Now you can hear me. And by the way, we're in full 60
[59.82s -> 69.18s]  FPS. Not 30. Not the 30 bullshit. This is 60 FPS. And I got a lav microphone and I hope it works
[69.18s -> 77.21s]  because if it doesn't then we're in big fucking trouble. Oh shit, I got a tweet. Does everybody
[77.21s -> 86.76s]  hold on? Hang tight. So you can hear? All right. I need to test this shit because I have no idea
[86.76s -> 95.93s]  how this sounds. I literally got these microphones like a day ago, not even 24 hours ago. If these
[95.93s -> 102.62s]  things work, this company's getting a major shout out. Like huge shout out. And by the way,
[102.62s -> 116.81s]  high quality camera this time too. High quality camera. Does this sound good? All right, hold on.
[116.81s -> 123.91s]  Let me just tweet that. Yeah, so hopefully it sounds all right. These things are pretty cool.
[125.03s -> 130.10s]  Let me try a scream test. Can I try? Hold on. Can I scream? Can I scream in your ears? I'm
[130.10s -> 136.36s]  gonna scream in your ears. Seriously, like I'm gonna scream in your ears and let me know how it is.
[136.36s -> 143.50s]  Ready? Why would I not do this in front of the green screen? All right, ready? This is an audio
[143.50s -> 152.25s]  test. What's up? Audio test. Testing the audio. I'm gonna scream, so turn down your volume. I'm
[152.25s -> 159.03s]  being dead serious. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That was probably horrible.
[159.03s -> 168.09s]  I don't know. I just got these microphones like fucking a day ago. Is it bad? Is it okay? I mean,
[168.09s -> 175.24s]  we're peaking, but I mean, is it all right? You should smoke cigarettes. I'm not gonna smoke a
[175.24s -> 189.82s]  cigarette. Is it okay? Dude, my little brother's head just, whatever. Oh yeah, we need to tell
[189.82s -> 196.95s]  Discord we're doing this. I've got my wonderful production assistant Holly here. You understand
[196.95s -> 201.43s]  how much of a pain in the ass this was to do alone for the last fucking three or four years?
[201.43s -> 207.98s]  You understand how hard this was to do alone? What a pain in the ass it was. I promise, I'm not,
[207.98s -> 211.74s]  I'm gonna, it's gonna peak. It's gonna happen, but let's see, I got the gray shirt. I'm good to go.
[211.74s -> 216.70s]  So what's the first thing I should do? She's gonna be here to help me. This is gonna be so much
[216.70s -> 223.02s]  easier. All right, so what I have to add, let's get some classics. Let's get some classics out
[223.02s -> 237.78s]  of the way first. Do I still got it? Do I still got it? Medium shot. That's not how I do it. What
[237.78s -> 244.87s]  am I doing? Hold on, wait, that's not, that's not how I do it. I gotta come into frame with it.
[244.87s -> 262.90s]  I gotta see if I still got it. All right. I still fucking got it. Sorry, mom. All right, so what's
[262.90s -> 269.19s]  the first thing? There are like 300 fucking things I have to do right now. I'm not doing this ever
[269.19s -> 280.55s]  again. This is the last time, so we're gonna blow through these like a million times a second.
[280.55s -> 304.95s]  Wait, what? How? Why? Who? How? How? Why? How much? Where? Why? Huh? Who? How much? What was the
[304.95s -> 316.60s]  other ones? What are the other ones? Are you ready? Why are you ready? Into the camera or just off?
[317.24s -> 339.72s]  Are you ready? Are you ready? You don't look ready. Hey, how? Are you ready? They didn't hear that.
[339.72s -> 343.29s]  They didn't hear that. You didn't hear that. You didn't hear that. I have a lavalier microphone,
[343.29s -> 349.82s]  but you didn't hear that, okay? What was I asking you? How? How do you do that again? Okay,
[349.82s -> 360.36s]  are you ready? Because, I mean, very clearly we gotta go. Did they hear it? Answer? There are
[360.36s -> 375.37s]  answers. All right, give me. I have both of my hands in my back pocket. Like, oh, yeah, all right.
[375.37s -> 400.87s]  Yes. Yes. Yes. No. No. No. Absolutely not. No. I ain't gonna do it. No. No. Sorry. No. No. Why not?
[400.87s -> 405.61s]  I feel like I'm at like a weird audition. I feel like I'm at an audition right now.
[405.61s -> 410.09s]  There's like three people with clipboards over there, and they're just like judging every word
[410.09s -> 424.33s]  I'm saying. Why not? Huh? No. No. I'm sorry. No. I ain't gonna do it. Oh, fuck you. You see what
[424.33s -> 431.51s]  I got dealing with back here? You think I'm gonna do that shit? No. You do it. You go do it. You deal
[431.51s -> 436.04s]  with this. No, I'm not dealing with that. I may have caused it, but I'm not gonna deal with it.
[436.04s -> 447.96s]  You are. You're the one with the money. All right. What's next? Yes. All right. What is
[447.96s -> 458.18s]  backroom Jerma? Yeah. What is it? Come around the corner, stop and stare at the camera like a madman
[458.18s -> 463.86s]  for a few seconds before sprinting at the camera. All right. Why is it? How is this back rooms? What
[463.86s -> 474.12s]  does that even mean? Like this? They can hear all these burps and it's gonna be fucking embarrassing.
[474.12s -> 477.82s]  They're gonna hear literally every single one of these burps. They're gonna hear every burp and
[477.82s -> 480.70s]  it's gonna be, they're gonna clip every single burp I've done and it's gonna be embarrassing.
[480.70s -> 485.88s]  All right. Don't listen to my burps. Just fucking delete them. Don't listen to them. All right. So
[485.88s -> 507.27s]  around the corner, stare and then run at the screen. I just lost a shoe. Hold on. Take two.
[507.27s -> 538.42s]  Take two. Take two. What fell? Okay. We're good. Is that the only thing that fell? I think it bumped
[538.42s -> 558.46s]  up. I didn't, nothing happened to me. All right. Are we still live? We're good. Oh, that's an
[558.46s -> 570.95s]  expensive mic. No, it's not. Wait, that's yours? Oh shit. I'll replace it. I promise. Now the worst
[570.95s -> 575.42s]  part about that is you didn't get to see that, which actually kind of sucks, but I full sprinted
[575.42s -> 579.10s]  back there and there's a million cords here and I tripped over one of the cords and took an
[579.10s -> 585.98s]  expensive microphone down. I'm gonna replace it. I'm gonna replace it. There's so many cords back
[585.98s -> 613.46s]  there that I almost like died. All right. We'll do it again. Here we go. There you go. Okay.
[613.46s -> 620.92s]  I'm not gonna, thank God it wasn't the ethernet. Okay. Ride a roller coaster. What are these?
[621.64s -> 638.57s]  Okay. Roller coaster. Should I be in a seat? Does this work? I hope this works. I wish that
[638.57s -> 647.61s]  was on camera. God damn it. It sucks that that wasn't on camera. So I'm gonna roller coaster.
[647.61s -> 660.87s]  Should we do this from two different angles? Okay. I've been waiting to ride this one, man.
[660.87s -> 668.01s]  Yeah. You know, I heard this is the scariest ride at the park. I'm not scared though. Are you scared?
[668.01s -> 682.54s]  Yeah, I bet you are. I bet you're scared. I'm not scared at all. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Whoa. Hey.
[682.54s -> 690.06s]  Hey. Hey, you can see the whole park from here. Can you see? That's crazy. Dude, look, you can see.
[690.06s -> 697.91s]  You can see the water rides. I didn't even know the park had water rides. Okay. Yeah, dude. Hey.
[699.34s -> 709.56s]  Yep. Okay. Yep. Now I ain't gonna scream. You're gonna scream though. Okay. This is really how I
[709.56s -> 742.82s]  know. Why is every wooden roller coaster do this shit? Yeah. Holy God. I was trying to be spinning.
[742.82s -> 748.01s]  Why am I spinning around? Dude, I got it. I got it. I'm all right. I'm all right. This thing ain't
[748.01s -> 751.93s]  safe, man. This thing's not even a safe ride. I don't think this has been raided. Has this
[751.93s -> 759.45s]  ship even been raided? It's all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. Yeah. Yeah.
[759.45s -> 776.33s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Oh, we. Let me give you a
[776.33s -> 780.84s]  better one. Let me give you a better one. This is what I would do on a roller coaster. I wouldn't
[780.84s -> 800.63s]  be saying we. I'd be screaming. All right. Here we go. Stop turning. Hey, man. Hey, you know what
[800.63s -> 815.32s]  I mean? This is a big drop coming up here. I don't like doing that. I feel like I'm gonna fall out.
[818.34s -> 822.42s]  Okay. Nobody uses for anything else besides what we're doing this for. There's no way anyone's
[822.42s -> 826.34s]  gonna use this for anything else besides riding a fucking roller coaster. All right. That's enough.
[830.28s -> 839.43s]  Evil villain monologue. I feel like I need to be in an evil villain costume. What do we have for
[839.43s -> 853.19s]  costume? Do I want to drink poison? Oh, I was like, what? There we go.
[858.46s -> 862.14s]  Gary's mod rag doll animation. Okay. Is that better? You can hear me, right?

[875.26s -> 879.50s]  me see if I can try it. There's so much shit back here. We're going to be here all night.
[880.44s -> 914.10s]  All right. The family guy thing is this, right? You go like that. Oh, it's like that.

[973.35s -> 977.03s]  I don't like when the bugs are everywhere. I can tolerate them when they're in small doses,
[978.06s -> 983.19s]  but dude, is this something on me? Is this something on my back? Is this something on my back?

[1056.14s -> 1059.14s]  Oh, it's because it flipped upside down.
[1059.14s -> 1062.02s]  Move it to your shoulder.
[1062.02s -> 1067.01s]  They can, wow!
[1067.01s -> 1069.89s]  Alright, hold on, give me one second.
[1069.89s -> 1082.43s]  That's fucking crazy!
[1082.43s -> 1084.43s]  Somebody said, dude, we can hear your heart murmur.
[1084.43s -> 1090.43s]  Can you still hear it?
[1092.43s -> 1097.28s]  Are we good? Is that better?
[1097.28s -> 1102.98s]  No more heart palpitations?
[1102.98s -> 1109.25s]  I can't move.
[1109.25s -> 1111.68s]  Alright, so what have we got? What's next?
[1111.68s -> 1115.65s]  I'm on TV. Alright, that's probably up here.
[1115.65s -> 1125.82s]  They're filming.
[1125.82s -> 1132.29s]  Are you filming? I'm on TV.
[1132.29s -> 1134.29s]  They're filming, right?
[1134.29s -> 1138.32s]  Get out of here.
[1140.26s -> 1144.98s]  Hi, Mom!
[1144.98s -> 1147.42s]  Hey, Mom, I'm on TV! I'm sorry.
[1147.42s -> 1148.42s]  Can I have the mic?
[1148.42s -> 1150.42s]  No, you don't have to give it to me.
[1150.42s -> 1152.42s]  I'm on TV, Mom! Look at me, I'm on TV!
[1152.42s -> 1154.42s]  I'm on the television!
[1154.42s -> 1156.42s]  Channel 2!
[1156.42s -> 1159.10s]  I'll leave, I'll leave.
[1159.10s -> 1161.10s]  That's so cool that you guys are here.
[1161.10s -> 1163.28s]  That's awesome that you guys are here.
[1163.28s -> 1166.29s]  Do you guys come here a lot?
[1166.29s -> 1168.29s]  Maybe once every few months?
[1168.29s -> 1170.29s]  That's cool. Can I talk on the mic?
[1170.29s -> 1172.59s]  No, it's okay. Alright, I don't need to.
[1172.59s -> 1175.47s]  Can I talk? Okay, alright.
[1175.47s -> 1178.35s]  Bye, Mom. Pasta tonight.
[1178.35s -> 1181.34s]  Pasta tonight, Mom.
[1181.34s -> 1184.03s]  I hope so. I'll be okay with McDonald's soup.
[1184.03s -> 1196.94s]  Alright, now what?
[1196.94s -> 1198.94s]  Cartoon splat?
[1198.94s -> 1202.34s]  Oh, like I'm running into the wall.
[1202.34s -> 1206.16s]  I'll do that one.
[1206.16s -> 1221.44s]  That hurt. I'll do it again.
[1221.44s -> 1223.87s]  Let me come from this angle this time.
[1223.87s -> 1248.35s]  Okay, what's next?
[1248.35s -> 1250.35s]  Yell at God.
[1258.29s -> 1260.98s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1260.98s -> 1263.28s]  Real funny.
[1263.28s -> 1267.74s]  Real funny stuff.
[1267.74s -> 1269.74s]  You did this.
[1269.74s -> 1273.65s]  You did this, and you can fix it too, you know.
[1273.65s -> 1275.65s]  What a real piece of work you are.
[1275.65s -> 1277.65s]  Oh, you created everybody.
[1277.65s -> 1280.96s]  Did you though? Sure it wasn't me.
[1280.96s -> 1282.96s]  I could have been up there. I could have been up there and I could have done it.
[1282.96s -> 1287.17s]  You're a real piece of work.
[1287.17s -> 1289.41s]  You know what?
[1289.41s -> 1291.41s]  I can't even say it to you, but you know what I was going to say.
[1291.41s -> 1294.78s]  I was going to say,
[1294.78s -> 1296.78s]  Forget you. That's better.
[1296.78s -> 1300.50s]  Forget you, G-O-D.
[1300.50s -> 1304.14s]  You know, you have the power to fix all this.
[1304.14s -> 1308.10s]  Where are you?
[1308.10s -> 1311.23s]  We're all down here waiting for you.
[1311.23s -> 1314.50s]  You are a real piece of work.
[1314.50s -> 1325.36s]  Hopefully you can hear me.
[1325.36s -> 1329.33s]  So what? I'm standing in the street.
[1329.33s -> 1331.70s]  I've got something to say to you.
[1331.70s -> 1334.70s]  And hopefully you listen this time.
[1334.70s -> 1336.70s]  Not like the other 30 or 40 times in the shower that I've done this.
[1336.70s -> 1340.66s]  You know what? F you. For real.
[1340.66s -> 1345.18s]  I said it. Yeah, I did.
[1345.18s -> 1347.18s]  How long do you want me to do this for?
[1347.18s -> 1354.40s]  AI Andy, okay.
[1354.40s -> 1371.15s]  Ah.
[1371.15s -> 1382.13s]  Hmm. Hmm. Uh-uh.
[1382.13s -> 1397.39s]  Uh-uh. Hmm. Mmm-mmm.
[1397.39s -> 1426.10s]  Ah. Yes. Yes.
[1426.10s -> 1441.04s]  Ugh. Ugh.
[1441.04s -> 1446.08s]  Ugh. Sword?
[1446.08s -> 1454.83s]  Oh, Oblivion, okay.
[1454.83s -> 1460.45s]  Stop, criminal scum.
[1460.45s -> 1463.58s]  I've never played Oblivion. I don't know how this works.
[1463.58s -> 1466.08s]  I've never played one minute of Oblivion.
[1466.08s -> 1468.45s]  No, I stream for like a day.
[1468.45s -> 1471.20s]  What do they say? What do you do?
[1471.20s -> 1475.42s]  It's stop criminal scum, right?
[1475.42s -> 1480.80s]  Is it stop criminal scum?
[1480.80s -> 1489.89s]  Stop, you violated. Okay, you violated the law.
[1489.89s -> 1492.77s]  Stop, criminal scum.
[1492.77s -> 1495.20s]  You violated the law. You will pay in blood.
[1495.20s -> 1508.18s]  Let's go.
[1508.18s -> 1512.75s]  Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[1512.75s -> 1527.82s]  Stop. Ugh.
[1527.82s -> 1537.66s]  Stop. Did I do good?
[1537.66s -> 1541.25s]  I want just some sword shit too, you know what I mean?
[1541.25s -> 1551.86s]  Swim? Well, I got the sword. Hold on.
[1551.86s -> 1553.86s]  Oh, they walk into chairs. Yeah, they do walk into chairs.
[1553.86s -> 1562.34s]  Is my flight on? Yeah, I keep it here.
[1562.34s -> 1564.34s]  Make sure MPVs are shit like you and end up
[1564.34s -> 1567.41s]  doing something fucking dumb. I get you.
[1567.41s -> 1570.22s]  Is this Oblivion? Why is this not Oblivion anymore?
[1570.22s -> 1573.41s]  Hold on. What was that?
[1573.41s -> 1578.38s]  I don't know what that was.
[1578.38s -> 1582.14s]  But it was weird. Okay.
[1582.14s -> 1584.83s]  Yeah. Hey, how's up?
[1584.83s -> 1586.83s]  I heard you were talking about me and my kingdom.
[1586.83s -> 1589.20s]  Just a little too, a little too harsh.
[1589.20s -> 1593.86s]  You know, this was welded with Dragonbone.
[1593.86s -> 1597.12s]  I don't know if you can tell by looking at that.
[1597.12s -> 1600.64s]  I remember I was there
[1600.64s -> 1603.65s]  when this almost fell backwards.
[1603.65s -> 1605.65s]  I remember I was there when this was crafted in Dragonblood.
[1605.65s -> 1609.66s]  They call it Dragonstone Steel.
[1609.66s -> 1613.74s]  You think you can handle that?
[1613.74s -> 1616.29s]  You think you can handle that? Let's find out.
[1616.29s -> 1618.98s]  You want a duel? You and me.
[1618.98s -> 1621.47s]  Dragonbone Steel. With whatever you have there.
[1621.47s -> 1623.47s]  Whatever that is. What's that again?
[1623.47s -> 1627.54s]  Stainless steel? Yeah.
[1627.54s -> 1629.54s]  We all know how, we all know how sturdy that is.
[1629.54s -> 1632.74s]  Why don't you come over this way and let's see.
[1632.74s -> 1637.66s]  Come on. Why don't you come here.
[1637.66s -> 1645.33s]  Dragonbone technique.
[1645.33s -> 1667.33s]  Come on, come on. Easy, easy.
[1667.33s -> 1669.33s]  Ew. Ew. Ew.
[1669.33s -> 1673.17s]  Ew. Oops. I may have just
[1673.17s -> 1675.34s]  cut my finger. Oopsie. Oopsie.
[1675.34s -> 1677.34s]  Oopsie. Oopsie.
[1677.34s -> 1679.89s]  Oopsie. Oopsie.
[1679.89s -> 1683.15s]  Oopsie. It's okay. I'm fine. Come on. Come on!
[1683.15s -> 1685.15s]  Do it already. Let's go.
[1685.15s -> 1687.15s]  We can't just stand here all day, dude.
[1687.15s -> 1699.44s]  I got shit to do. Come on. Come at me.
[1699.44s -> 1701.44s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[1701.44s -> 1703.44s]  Yeah. Okay.
[1703.44s -> 1705.44s]  Yeah. Look at me.
[1705.44s -> 1708.56s]  Look at me right now. Yeah.
[1708.56s -> 1711.06s]  I won. Stainless steel. Would you get it off
[1711.06s -> 1713.06s]  the fucking god damn TV?
[1713.06s -> 1718.62s]  Get it off the TV. Clean him up.
[1718.62s -> 1726.11s]  I'm peaking.
[1726.11s -> 1733.15s]  Yeah. It's going to be peaking.
[1733.15s -> 1735.46s]  I can't help it. Do some twerking?
[1735.46s -> 1737.89s]  Alright.
[1737.89s -> 1740.90s]  This is poison. Drink poison.
[1740.90s -> 1749.02s]  Alright. This is poison.
[1749.02s -> 1757.78s]  Well, not really, but you know.
[1757.78s -> 1760.40s]  Oh, wow. A magical potion?
[1760.40s -> 1762.40s]  This is for me?
[1762.40s -> 1764.40s]  No way. Thank you.
[1764.40s -> 1766.90s]  How much do I owe you, stranger?
[1766.90s -> 1769.20s]  Ten pieces of gold?
[1769.20s -> 1771.89s]  That's a steal.
[1771.89s -> 1777.39s]  Okay. You can use that one if you want.
[1777.39s -> 1779.95s]  What is this? Potion.
[1779.95s -> 1782.51s]  Clear. Clean.
[1782.51s -> 1785.44s]  Crystal. Don't mind if I do.
[1785.44s -> 1789.58s]  That's an option?
[1789.58s -> 1792.40s]  Or, I already had it on me.
[1792.40s -> 1797.14s]  I'm going to have to take a health potion for that
[1797.14s -> 1803.20s]  after that one. Redo.
[1803.20s -> 1805.63s]  I'm going to need a health potion after that one.
[1805.63s -> 1817.98s]  Good thing I stocked a few of them.
[1817.98s -> 1822.27s]  That hurts. A little. Does that supposed to feel like that?
[1822.27s -> 1825.78s]  It feels. My whole face hurts.
[1825.78s -> 1828.53s]  My face is burning. That burns.
[1828.53s -> 1831.09s]  A lot. What the?
[1831.09s -> 1833.09s]  What is that?
[1835.71s -> 1839.04s]  I feel actually alright.
[1839.04s -> 1841.04s]  I feel warm. I feel really
[1841.04s -> 1846.67s]  warm though. What the?
[1846.67s -> 1849.04s]  What was that?
[1849.04s -> 1852.56s]  I'm going to lie down.
[1852.56s -> 1854.80s]  I don't know who gave this to me.
[1854.80s -> 1865.17s]  I can hear my heartbeat
[1865.17s -> 1867.60s]  through my own head.
[1867.60s -> 1872.64s]  Okay. What's next?
[1872.64s -> 1875.78s]  What else we got? I love people clapping.
[1875.78s -> 1880.19s]  Twerk?
[1880.19s -> 1883.07s]  I'm going to twerk.
[1883.07s -> 1886.27s]  Yeah, I'm going to twerk. Yeah, I'll twerk.
[1886.27s -> 1888.83s]  I don't care. I'll twerk with the fucking
[1888.83s -> 1891.01s]  crown on. The king.
[1891.01s -> 1894.53s]  I want everyone to understand
[1894.53s -> 1897.97s]  that the king made a lot
[1897.97s -> 1899.97s]  of good things happen today, don't you think?
[1899.97s -> 1903.04s]  You little jester over there.
[1903.04s -> 1905.79s]  You're so funny. I made things happen.
[1905.79s -> 1907.79s]  I raised taxes on everybody.
[1907.79s -> 1910.10s]  Every single person now owes
[1910.10s -> 1912.10s]  40% more taxes. That means more money for
[1912.10s -> 1915.98s]  the kingdom. Oh yeah.
[1915.98s -> 1918.42s]  How many people did we kill today? 60?
[1918.42s -> 1921.17s]  Yeah. That's a lot. Could have been 70
[1921.17s -> 1923.17s]  though. Could have been 70.
[1923.17s -> 1928.77s]  It was a good day. What's that?
[1928.77s -> 1931.14s]  What's that? What did you say? Okay.
[1931.14s -> 1935.54s]  Feed him to the lions.
[1935.54s -> 1937.54s]  Yeah, feed him. Feed him to the lions.
[1937.54s -> 1946.62s]  Don't you think? I don't know how to twerk.
[1946.62s -> 1949.57s]  How do you twerk?
[1949.57s -> 1952.06s]  You have to go like
[1952.06s -> 1956.61s]  that. That looks like I was about to start
[1956.61s -> 1960.00s]  like jamming. Get the
[1960.00s -> 1974.58s]  crown off. I don't
[1974.58s -> 1979.18s]  fucking know how it works.
[1979.18s -> 1981.18s]  Oh god. Okay.
[1981.18s -> 1983.94s]  Goblin time?
[1983.94s -> 1985.94s]  Alright, hold on. I got to do
[1985.94s -> 1988.24s]  a wardrobe change. What was
[1988.24s -> 1991.95s]  that? I don't know how
[1991.95s -> 1993.95s]  it works. I really don't get it.
[1993.95s -> 1996.38s]  I'm 37 years old. I don't
[1996.38s -> 1998.38s]  twerk.
[1998.38s -> 2004.26s]  That's alright. Do I have
[2004.26s -> 2006.26s]  like a thing to put on? Like a drape?
[2006.26s -> 2010.93s]  Oblivion guards? Didn't
[2010.93s -> 2015.66s]  I just do that?
[2015.66s -> 2020.78s]  Skyrim guards? I don't even know.
[2020.78s -> 2024.62s]  I don't play Skyrim. Yeah, we'll
[2024.62s -> 2029.87s]  put that on. I'm going to mute the mic while
[2029.87s -> 2031.87s]  I get into some different piece of clothes.
[2031.87s -> 2075.89s]  I'll be right back in two seconds. Yeah,
[2075.89s -> 2077.89s]  I'm changing clothes. It's going to be all awful.
[2077.89s -> 2079.89s]  You're going to be able to hear awful noises.
[2079.89s -> 2081.89s]  Because I have this lapel
[2081.89s -> 2083.89s]  thing on. Give me one sec.
[2083.89s -> 2118.26s]  Can you guys still hear me?
[2118.26s -> 2120.26s]  Do I sound okay? Can you guys still actually
[2120.26s -> 2124.54s]  hear what I'm saying? Do I sound alright?
[2124.54s -> 2128.51s]  Okay. I don't think these little boots
[2128.51s -> 2130.69s]  are going to fit on.
[2130.69s -> 2133.63s]  Let me take my shoes. Yeah, there we go.
[2133.63s -> 2135.63s]  I'm going to look like such a dickhead.
[2135.63s -> 2138.13s]  What am I supposed to even be
[2138.13s -> 2140.37s]  doing in this?
[2140.37s -> 2142.37s]  A jester?
[2142.37s -> 2144.37s]  Entertaining.
[2144.37s -> 2146.37s]  Just entertaining as a jester.
[2146.37s -> 2150.78s]  All they're going to be able to hear is
[2150.78s -> 2155.26s]  the sound.
[2155.26s -> 2157.26s]  I need to confirm how much of an asshole I look like in this.
[2157.26s -> 2160.40s]  Do I look like a fucking asshole?
[2160.40s -> 2165.70s]  I need to see the mirror.
[2165.70s -> 2168.06s]  Okay, this is literally
[2168.06s -> 2170.06s]  just a shitty Halloween costume that somebody got
[2170.06s -> 2172.94s]  last second from a bag.
[2172.94s -> 2174.94s]  This is like, oh yeah, dude, there was a Halloween party.
[2174.94s -> 2176.94s]  You coming? Yeah, yeah, of course
[2176.94s -> 2178.94s]  I am. And I just went and got a bag Halloween
[2178.94s -> 2181.50s]  costume. Let me see the flute.
[2181.50s -> 2189.55s]  Let me see. This is going to be
[2189.55s -> 2200.69s]  fucking loud. Yes, Sia?
[2200.69s -> 2211.42s]  Of course.
[2211.42s -> 2213.98s]  Am I blowing the wrong way?
[2213.98s -> 2223.38s]  How do I do it?
[2223.38s -> 2231.95s]  That was kind of cool. Somebody make me fly away
[2231.95s -> 2233.95s]  like Zelda, you know what I mean?
[2233.95s -> 2236.38s]  Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[2236.38s -> 2239.20s]  There's some junk. Oh, no, that's okay.
[2239.20s -> 2241.20s]  I'll do that. Let me do this dumbass
[2241.20s -> 2248.88s]  routine. Hold on.
[2248.88s -> 2254.70s]  Oh, yes, yes, of course. Yes.
[2263.28s -> 2265.28s]  You're in trouble. You're in
[2265.28s -> 2273.92s]  trouble. Get him.
[2273.92s -> 2276.35s]  Yes, yes. Kill him.
[2276.35s -> 2282.69s]  Kill him. Why am I hunching over?
[2282.69s -> 2285.44s]  No, they don't hunch over like that, do they?
[2285.44s -> 2288.19s]  Well, I'm like, oh yes,
[2288.19s -> 2290.19s]  kill him. I'm like a goblin.
[2290.19s -> 2292.19s]  I'm supposed to be like funny. Okay.
[2292.19s -> 2304.16s]  Sia says that you're in big trouble,
[2304.16s -> 2308.00s]  Harry. Harry Potter.
[2308.00s -> 2313.50s]  I'm not supposed
[2313.50s -> 2315.50s]  to be in this movie.
[2315.50s -> 2317.50s]  I don't know why I went to that. I just feel like I belong
[2317.50s -> 2319.50s]  there. Don't you understand? I feel like I belong
[2319.50s -> 2321.50s]  in that universe. Alright, let's try it again.
[2321.50s -> 2329.42s]  They don't even have kings. Alright.
[2329.42s -> 2331.42s]  Oh, yes.
[2331.42s -> 2333.42s]  Of course. Of course.
[2333.42s -> 2338.10s]  Sia says you're about to be in very
[2338.10s -> 2340.10s]  big trouble.
[2340.10s -> 2343.74s]  Oh, he's very angry.
[2343.74s -> 2345.74s]  Sia. Sia.
[2345.74s -> 2347.74s]  He's angry.
[2347.74s -> 2356.56s]  Was that loud, Sia? I'll be softer.
[2356.56s -> 2375.82s]  When do I get paid? Hopefully soon.
[2375.82s -> 2381.31s]  Would you like to hear a song?
[2381.31s -> 2385.02s]  I know Metallica.
[2385.02s -> 2388.29s]  I know the wind song.
[2388.29s -> 2390.29s]  The song of storms from
[2390.29s -> 2393.17s]  Zelda. That one?
[2393.17s -> 2414.74s]  Is that more than one note?
[2414.74s -> 2416.74s]  Oh, you mean the juggle?
[2416.74s -> 2437.09s]  Nobody does it as good
[2437.09s -> 2439.39s]  as Jester the Great.
[2439.39s -> 2441.39s]  And thank you.
[2441.39s -> 2443.57s]  And thank you.
[2443.57s -> 2454.70s]  Thank you, especially you.
[2454.70s -> 2456.70s]  And thank you.
[2464.00s -> 2474.75s]  The family guy death.
[2474.75s -> 2478.46s]  This motherfucker's
[2478.46s -> 2482.82s]  in jeans, too.
[2482.82s -> 2484.82s]  Yeah, let me
[2484.82s -> 2489.04s]  put this up. Kill the Jester.
[2489.04s -> 2491.28s]  Twerk as the Jester.
[2491.28s -> 2495.04s]  Alright,
[2495.04s -> 2506.18s]  might as well.
[2506.18s -> 2508.18s]  It's twerking time.
[2508.18s -> 2512.32s]  Sia, get down.
[2512.32s -> 2514.32s]  I've been a Jedi agent the whole time. Get down,
[2514.32s -> 2519.62s]  Sia. Back it up.
[2519.62s -> 2534.77s]  How we doing?
[2534.77s -> 2540.21s]  Okay, yep. This is gonna do. No, it's okay.
[2540.21s -> 2543.15s]  So pantomime each note.
[2543.15s -> 2578.86s]  I'm probably so red.
[2578.86s -> 2597.87s]  I'm like hot.
[2599.87s -> 2601.87s]  I'm like holding my breath to do that.
[2601.87s -> 2604.56s]  Because I can't breathe. I can't breathe
[2604.56s -> 2609.68s]  into this fucking thing. I can't
[2609.68s -> 2612.56s]  breathe. I have to hold
[2612.56s -> 2614.56s]  my breath to do this.
[2614.56s -> 2616.56s]  Oh, just pantomime every note. Hold your fucking
[2616.56s -> 2643.44s]  breath.
[2643.44s -> 2645.74s]  Do what you want with that.
[2645.74s -> 2653.04s]  I don't care. Do a bong
[2653.04s -> 2659.31s]  rip? Oh,
[2659.31s -> 2661.31s]  okay, right, yeah.
[2661.31s -> 2663.31s]  Should I do?
[2663.31s -> 2665.31s]  I don't want to get out of this unless I'm gonna do everything in it.
[2665.31s -> 2669.54s]  Oh, yeah, wizard stuff.
[2669.54s -> 2674.98s]  This thing's just jingly fucking
[2674.98s -> 2686.50s]  thing out of here.
[2686.50s -> 2688.50s]  Of course,
[2688.50s -> 2690.50s]  I'm gonna do fucking Harry Potter shit
[2690.50s -> 2692.50s]  again, right?
[2692.50s -> 2694.50s]  Should I be more like the mouth oils?
[2694.50s -> 2696.50s]  I need a mustache, too.
[2696.50s -> 2698.50s]  That's important.
[2698.50s -> 2700.50s]  I have to do the Harry Potter shit
[2700.50s -> 2703.38s]  again. I'm gonna look like such
[2703.38s -> 2706.06s]  a moron. Hold on.
[2706.06s -> 2710.86s]  What are the mouth oils?
[2710.86s -> 2719.49s]  Let me do this.
[2719.49s -> 2726.21s]  Hold that for a sec. Balls
[2726.21s -> 2729.22s]  exposed? What are you talking about?
[2729.22s -> 2733.76s]  My balls are not exposed.
[2733.76s -> 2735.76s]  Oh, I see.
[2735.76s -> 2737.76s]  They mean those balls. I get it, yeah.
[2737.76s -> 2740.90s]  Wait, what is that?
[2740.90s -> 2743.26s]  Do any of the mouth oils have
[2743.26s -> 2746.46s]  beards?
[2746.46s -> 2748.46s]  Who owns mouth oils family?
[2748.46s -> 2750.96s]  Who's like that mouth oil, the head
[2750.96s -> 2754.03s]  of mouth oil?
[2754.03s -> 2757.49s]  Hold on.
[2757.49s -> 2759.49s]  I kind of feel like I could do this in the camera.
[2759.49s -> 2766.21s]  You know what I mean? Who owns mouth oils family?
[2766.21s -> 2768.21s]  Is it like Dave mouth oil?
[2768.21s -> 2780.75s]  Hold on. How's it look?
[2780.75s -> 2789.97s]  Like a judge.
[2789.97s -> 2791.97s]  Should I just do judge shit instead?
[2791.97s -> 2799.65s]  I look like a fucking judge.
[2799.65s -> 2804.58s]  This is not a wand.
[2804.58s -> 2806.58s]  Harry. I don't think I'll talk like
[2806.58s -> 2809.07s]  Harry. You're not as
[2809.07s -> 2811.07s]  smart as all of us. You're not as smart as the rest of us.
[2811.07s -> 2814.21s]  They all look like this.
[2814.21s -> 2817.79s]  Get him. Seize him. Take him away.
[2817.79s -> 2820.29s]  My son
[2820.29s -> 2822.29s]  is way more intelligent
[2822.29s -> 2824.29s]  than you'll ever be, Harry.
[2824.29s -> 2826.29s]  And you prance around
[2826.29s -> 2828.29s]  and act like a little boy
[2828.29s -> 2830.29s]  while my little boy
[2830.29s -> 2832.29s]  also prances around too, apparently.
[2832.29s -> 2835.55s]  Wait, this is actually
[2835.55s -> 2837.55s]  okay.
[2837.55s -> 2841.84s]  I don't think I could put this on.
[2841.84s -> 2848.48s]  Should we tape it? I need my wand
[2848.48s -> 2859.30s]  too. I'm just going to tie it like a
[2859.30s -> 2864.93s]  regular knot. I don't care. I don't care.
[2864.93s -> 2869.22s]  That's fine.
[2869.22s -> 2881.04s]  Okay, how's that? If you aim to
[2881.04s -> 2883.04s]  duel somebody, go for it for real.
[2883.04s -> 2899.49s]  Harry Potter.
[2899.49s -> 2903.07s]  Wonderful to see you
[2903.07s -> 2905.07s]  here. Don't you have class, Harry?
[2905.07s -> 2907.31s]  Class is in session
[2907.31s -> 2909.31s]  right now. Potions.
[2909.31s -> 2911.31s]  Heard you're quite the student.
[2911.31s -> 2913.55s]  You and Ron
[2913.55s -> 2915.55s]  and Hermione. Hermione.
[2915.55s -> 2919.07s]  I'm keeping an eye on you,
[2919.07s -> 2921.76s]  Potter. You mess up
[2921.76s -> 2923.76s]  one more time and you
[2923.76s -> 2925.76s]  talk to my boy
[2925.76s -> 2927.76s]  Lucius
[2927.76s -> 2930.38s]  Malfoyle again like that.
[2930.38s -> 2933.84s]  It'll be the end of you. And if you're going
[2933.84s -> 2935.84s]  to use your wand, I might as well suggest
[2935.84s -> 2938.72s]  you use it. No bluffing
[2938.72s -> 2941.02s]  this time, Harry. No bluffing.
[2941.02s -> 2947.04s]  You're a little shit and you
[2947.04s -> 2949.04s]  always were. But you didn't
[2949.04s -> 2951.04s]  know, Harry, that I have lightning hands.
[2958.14s -> 2968.11s]  Oh.
[2968.11s -> 2972.02s]  Oh, I killed him. I think I killed
[2972.02s -> 2974.83s]  him. Oh, I
[2974.83s -> 2976.83s]  Harry. Harry, are you okay? Harry.
[2976.83s -> 2978.83s]  I need a doctor. Hold on.
[2978.83s -> 2982.48s]  Ividicus.
[2982.48s -> 2985.36s]  Okay, he's all right. He's fine.
[2985.36s -> 2987.36s]  He's fine. Everyone's laughing. If it's fine
[2987.36s -> 2991.33s]  it's okay. Harry's fine.
[2991.33s -> 3003.22s]  Hello,
[3003.22s -> 3006.22s]  students. Welcome to the Defense of the
[3006.22s -> 3009.81s]  Dark Arts class. My name
[3009.81s -> 3011.81s]  is Lucius Malfoyle.
[3011.81s -> 3014.74s]  I'm the new teacher in town.
[3014.74s -> 3016.74s]  And yes, I'm aware that your old
[3016.74s -> 3018.74s]  teacher has perished.
[3018.74s -> 3023.02s]  Dr. McGillicuddy.
[3023.02s -> 3027.63s]  Let's go ahead and open this. It's a great
[3027.63s -> 3029.63s]  peppermint schnapps, by the way.
[3029.63s -> 3034.75s]  I'm sorry.
[3034.75s -> 3036.75s]  I'm sorry.
[3036.75s -> 3039.25s]  If we could all open up your
[3039.25s -> 3041.25s]  textbooks and go to page 200,
[3041.25s -> 3043.62s]  please. We're going to be
[3043.62s -> 3046.11s]  using, yes, yes,
[3046.11s -> 3048.11s]  Ron, please.
[3048.11s -> 3050.74s]  Page 200, we're going to be making a frog
[3050.74s -> 3052.74s]  breath potion.
[3052.74s -> 3055.55s]  You know all about that, don't you, Harry?
[3055.55s -> 3058.67s]  The one you used
[3058.67s -> 3063.41s]  when you killed Lucius?
[3063.41s -> 3067.50s]  Open up your textbook.
[3067.50s -> 3071.73s]  I'm in the middle of teaching, Harry.
[3071.73s -> 3073.73s]  That's not the time to use that spell.
[3073.73s -> 3076.03s]  Didn't they ever tell you
[3076.03s -> 3078.03s]  you only use that spell if you mean to
[3078.03s -> 3080.91s]  kill another wizard? Never
[3080.91s -> 3082.91s]  use that spell, Harry.
[3082.91s -> 3086.88s]  And now you're going to be floating in the air.
[3086.88s -> 3090.21s]  There he is. Come around. Down.
[3090.21s -> 3093.60s]  Swinging around, he's swinging around, he's swinging around.
[3093.60s -> 3096.74s]  Down. Never use that spell
[3096.74s -> 3101.66s]  in my classroom again. Turn to page 300.
[3101.66s -> 3107.54s]  We're not doing that spell anymore.
[3107.54s -> 3110.42s]  Fucking gross. It tastes like
[3110.42s -> 3120.00s]  fucking Pez. There it is.
[3120.00s -> 3124.74s]  You know,
[3124.74s -> 3126.74s]  when I spend far too long
[3126.74s -> 3129.30s]  on this, people take
[3129.30s -> 3131.30s]  the shit that's not even funny and then they turn
[3131.30s -> 3133.30s]  it into something funny, so I'm very hopeful.
[3133.30s -> 3138.08s]  Okay, here we go.
[3138.08s -> 3140.38s]  Uh, no, no, period.
[3140.38s -> 3144.42s]  Well, class, it's been a pleasure.
[3144.42s -> 3146.66s]  Absolute pleasure.
[3146.66s -> 3148.96s]  But you all don't
[3148.96s -> 3150.96s]  understand the power of the Dark Lord.
[3150.96s -> 3152.96s]  And for that reason, I'm out.
[3152.96s -> 3155.46s]  Just like that show shark tank.
[3155.46s -> 3175.47s]  Yeah!
[3175.47s -> 3179.31s]  Oh, nice one, Harry.
[3179.31s -> 3181.31s]  Almost got me.
[3181.31s -> 3183.31s]  Holding onto my fucking balls.
[3183.31s -> 3188.37s]  This looks fucked.
[3188.37s -> 3197.44s]  I gotta go the other way. Does that work?
[3197.44s -> 3201.09s]  Hey, Harry. See you tomorrow on Potions, class.
[3201.09s -> 3205.82s]  How fucked is this?
[3205.82s -> 3217.02s]  Is this fucked up?
[3217.02s -> 3223.17s]  Do you look like the Witcher?
[3223.17s -> 3230.46s]  The Witcher? Hold on.
[3230.46s -> 3232.46s]  We gotta change into the Witcher.
[3232.46s -> 3244.48s]  Does the Witcher have an eye patch?
[3244.48s -> 3246.48s]  This tie is
[3246.48s -> 3248.48s]  so long. Can you see this?
[3248.48s -> 3250.48s]  I look like a
[3250.48s -> 3252.48s]  10-year-old wearing dad's suit
[3252.48s -> 3254.98s]  to work. Do you see? This is ridiculous.
[3254.98s -> 3256.98s]  This shouldn't be like this. I feel like I'm
[3256.98s -> 3263.44s]  two feet tall. What's a character's name
[3263.44s -> 3267.41s]  in The Witcher? Anybody that's not The Witcher
[3267.41s -> 3278.46s]  could be anybody.
[3278.46s -> 3281.58s]  Geralt.
[3281.58s -> 3290.21s]  Geralt of what? Rivia?
[3290.21s -> 3316.75s]  Geralt of Rivia?
[3316.75s -> 3321.54s]  I'll take a drink. You don't know who I am?
[3321.54s -> 3326.70s]  Geralt of Rivia. You should know.
[3326.70s -> 3329.33s]  Two orange juices. I'm gonna drink one now
[3329.33s -> 3342.93s]  and one later. Thank you.
[3342.93s -> 3345.94s]  Any witches? You seen any witches here?
[3345.94s -> 3350.27s]  No? Oh, I hate those motherfuckers.
[3350.27s -> 3360.30s]  Hey, you. Come here.
[3360.30s -> 3364.83s]  Heard you were a witch. I got a letter
[3364.83s -> 3366.83s]  from the King of Rivia that said that you were a
[3366.83s -> 3370.22s]  witch. Are you?
[3370.22s -> 3373.17s]  I've never played this game.
[3373.17s -> 3375.17s]  I've never played this game. I have never played
[3375.17s -> 3378.11s]  any of The Witchers. Do you want to know what I know
[3378.11s -> 3380.11s]  about The Witcher? Okay.
[3380.11s -> 3383.06s]  Here's what I know about The Witcher. I know about
[3383.06s -> 3385.06s]  The Witcher is this. I know that the first game
[3385.06s -> 3387.06s]  and the second game especially. Hey,
[3387.06s -> 3389.06s]  yeah, sit down. You're gonna want to hear this. Sit down,
[3389.06s -> 3391.62s]  witch. I heard that the second game
[3391.62s -> 3393.62s]  had four to five
[3393.62s -> 3395.62s]  minute loading screens when you
[3395.62s -> 3397.62s]  went outside or inside of a building.
[3397.62s -> 3399.62s]  So that's why I never played it. I never really
[3399.62s -> 3401.62s]  cared for it. I actually tried to load into
[3401.62s -> 3403.62s]  one building and I couldn't get in. It took about
[3403.62s -> 3405.62s]  four minutes. So I installed the game.
[3405.62s -> 3407.79s]  The game that I'm in. You're right. The Witcher
[3407.79s -> 3410.10s]  me. You got something to say about that?
[3410.10s -> 3412.10s]  We fixed the loading times in the Enhanced Edition.
[3412.10s -> 3414.98s]  Yup. Yup.
[3414.98s -> 3416.98s]  That's the guy that played it. That's the guy that
[3416.98s -> 3419.15s]  played the one before the Enhanced Edition.
[3419.15s -> 3421.90s]  Yeah, I remember. It sucked. What you gotta say
[3421.90s -> 3428.10s]  now? Witch. Wait, hold on.
[3428.10s -> 3430.10s]  Let me do my, like, let me do my patented move
[3430.10s -> 3448.14s]  that I do. That's what I did in all those games.
[3448.14s -> 3453.06s]  Rick Sanchez?
[3453.06s -> 3462.83s]  Give me a gun.
[3462.83s -> 3471.20s]  I can't.
[3471.20s -> 3477.79s]  Wait, it smells. Goblin
[3477.79s -> 3482.27s]  Time? Alright, let's do Goblin Time.
[3482.27s -> 3486.50s]  Yeah, give me the beard. The whole
[3486.50s -> 3489.18s]  thing smells. It all smells.
[3489.18s -> 3491.18s]  Why does everything that comes out of a costume bag
[3491.18s -> 3495.20s]  smell? They smell
[3495.20s -> 3505.89s]  like chemicals.
[3505.89s -> 3521.36s]  Like this? Gandalf?
[3521.36s -> 3523.36s]  Oh wait, no, Gandalf. Alright, I want
[3523.36s -> 3525.60s]  someone to put me in the PlayStation 2
[3525.60s -> 3537.06s]  Lord of the Rings game. Is it right-handed or left-handed?
[3537.06s -> 3582.86s]  I just want someone to do that.
[3582.86s -> 3591.98s]  Oh.
[3591.98s -> 3596.40s]  You shall
[3596.40s -> 3604.62s]  not
[3604.62s -> 3606.62s]  pass.
[3608.86s -> 3615.18s]  You are
[3615.18s -> 3617.74s]  not gonna go by me.
[3617.74s -> 3624.83s]  You are not passing
[3624.83s -> 3633.34s]  any time soon, Buster. I can do that
[3633.34s -> 3635.58s]  better. You shall
[3635.58s -> 3645.17s]  not pass. What's next?
[3645.17s -> 3647.17s]  Goblin Time? Okay.
[3647.17s -> 3657.79s]  Yeah, I'll do the chef stuff.
[3657.79s -> 3663.23s]  What the hell is this?
[3663.23s -> 3699.57s]  Peer into the orb?
[3699.57s -> 3714.32s]  Do we have an outlet?
[3714.32s -> 3718.54s]  How am I gonna do this?
[3718.54s -> 3722.51s]  Oh, I heard. I see
[3722.51s -> 3725.01s]  many things in here.
[3725.01s -> 3733.31s]  Frodo, I see you.
[3733.31s -> 3735.31s]  I see Sam. And I see
[3735.31s -> 3738.43s]  Hawaii. I want to go there
[3738.43s -> 3742.13s]  soon. After all this, of course.
[3742.13s -> 3744.56s]  After all this. You need to go
[3744.56s -> 3746.80s]  to Mordor.
[3746.80s -> 3749.42s]  Which, if I had to guess,
[3749.42s -> 3752.69s]  is a place
[3752.69s -> 3755.44s]  which, if I had to guess,
[3755.44s -> 3758.19s]  would be in this location
[3758.19s -> 3760.50s]  here, covered by all
[3760.50s -> 3762.50s]  the smoke and spout.
[3762.50s -> 3765.50s]  Why don't you take it? I'm
[3765.50s -> 3767.50s]  sweating. I'm sweating my
[3767.50s -> 3769.50s]  ass off in this thing, Frodo.
[3769.50s -> 3771.50s]  Take this from me. It's very hot.
[3771.50s -> 3773.50s]  As you can see, it's burning. It burns
[3773.50s -> 3775.50s]  my head and my face and it's making me red
[3775.50s -> 3777.50s]  and sweaty. Take it, Frodo.
[3777.50s -> 3780.13s]  Take it from me. Please.
[3780.13s -> 3782.13s]  Take it now.
[3782.13s -> 3784.13s]  Ow! Ow! It hurts, Frodo.
[3784.13s -> 3791.74s]  Take it!
[3794.50s -> 3801.34s]  With this?
[3801.34s -> 3803.97s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[3803.97s -> 3805.97s]  I see something horrible.
[3805.97s -> 3810.24s]  Come closer.
[3810.24s -> 3812.24s]  Tomorrow afternoon,
[3812.24s -> 3814.80s]  a dire thing will happen to you.
[3814.80s -> 3818.00s]  It will spill your
[3818.00s -> 3820.24s]  water on the table.
[3820.24s -> 3822.24s]  And it will drip, drip, drip over the edge
[3822.24s -> 3824.80s]  down to the ground.
[3824.80s -> 3827.23s]  And it will keep dripping
[3827.23s -> 3829.23s]  to a point where you have to wipe
[3829.23s -> 3831.23s]  under the table because water
[3831.23s -> 3833.23s]  got under the table side
[3833.23s -> 3835.23s]  and you need to really wipe under there.
[3835.23s -> 3837.23s]  And then under these where the cabinets are,
[3837.23s -> 3839.23s]  it drops into the cabinets kind of.
[3839.23s -> 3841.73s]  You need to open the
[3841.73s -> 3843.73s]  cabinet door and wipe the side of the cabinet
[3843.73s -> 3846.35s]  and it sucks.
[3846.35s -> 3848.85s]  Be careful. Also,
[3848.85s -> 3851.71s]  next week,
[3851.71s -> 3853.71s]  you will buy a lottery ticket.
[3853.71s -> 3855.71s]  Yeah? Oh, yeah.
[3855.71s -> 3858.14s]  And then that lottery ticket,
[3858.14s -> 3860.14s]  you'll scratch off the first three numbers
[3860.14s -> 3862.14s]  and you'll be a winner.
[3862.14s -> 3864.14s]  And you will scream victory. You'll be so happy about this.
[3864.14s -> 3868.48s]  Unfortunately,
[3868.48s -> 3871.04s]  it's a $2 winner.
[3871.04s -> 3873.04s]  That sucks. That's really horrible.
[3873.04s -> 3875.04s]  Not even a $5 winner.
[3875.04s -> 3877.04s]  And it was a $5 ticket, by the way.
[3877.04s -> 3879.41s]  Oh, the gods are getting angry now.
[3879.41s -> 3881.84s]  They're getting very angry, Frodo.
[3881.84s -> 3884.66s]  One final thing
[3884.66s -> 3886.96s]  that I've heard, that I see
[3886.96s -> 3888.96s]  in this device
[3888.96s -> 3890.96s]  that was given to me
[3890.96s -> 3893.26s]  by a goblin, Frodo,
[3893.26s -> 3895.76s]  next weekend,
[3895.76s -> 3897.76s]  you're going to get invited to a party on Facebook.
[3897.76s -> 3900.83s]  You're going to say maybe.
[3900.83s -> 3903.33s]  And you're going to be kind of excited to go.
[3903.33s -> 3905.57s]  But they're going to cancel.
[3905.57s -> 3907.57s]  They're going to cancel it
[3907.57s -> 3909.57s]  right before you say
[3909.57s -> 3911.74s]  yes. Because you would have been
[3911.74s -> 3913.74s]  the tenth person which made
[3913.74s -> 3915.74s]  them have the party in the first place.
[3915.74s -> 3917.74s]  So you were the asshole.
[3917.74s -> 3919.92s]  If you had just said yes, you would have been
[3919.92s -> 3922.74s]  able to go. Oh, yep.
[3922.74s -> 3924.74s]  That one is bad.
[3924.74s -> 3927.04s]  Hot, hot, hot.
[3927.04s -> 3934.90s]  Yeah, let me get out of this.
[3934.90s -> 3945.71s]  Reddit wizard.
[3945.71s -> 3947.71s]  Nice shoes.
[3947.71s -> 3953.22s]  Rconfessions wizard.
[3953.22s -> 3955.90s]  What is that?
[3955.90s -> 3959.22s]  Rconfessions.
[3959.22s -> 3961.22s]  Consult the Funko Pop.
[3961.22s -> 3967.36s]  You need to do
[3967.36s -> 3969.36s]  Deckard Kane.
[3969.36s -> 3977.55s]  Sit in a stool in front of the green
[3977.55s -> 3979.55s]  and order an adult. Okay, I'll order some beverages.
[3979.55s -> 3981.86s]  Yeah, actually, let me mute
[3981.86s -> 3983.86s]  so you can, as I said, this is not horrible.
[3983.86s -> 3986.10s]  Do Sephiroth.
[3986.10s -> 3988.10s]  Every white-haired bearded
[3988.10s -> 3990.53s]  person, I can't do them all.
[3990.53s -> 4085.38s]  Hold on, give me one sec. Okay, coming up next
[4085.38s -> 4087.38s]  we're going to do, I'm going to do Solid Snake.
[4087.38s -> 4089.38s]  Somebody said get in the box and
[4089.38s -> 4094.56s]  do snake stuff. So I'm going to do
[4094.56s -> 4096.56s]  some snake stuff. I need the little gun too.
[4096.56s -> 4107.66s]  Dun dun.
[4107.66s -> 4110.10s]  I picked a great time to do this.
[4110.10s -> 4112.10s]  Like in the middle of the dead of
[4112.10s -> 4114.91s]  summer in Vegas. A hundred plus
[4114.91s -> 4118.05s]  degrees out right now. Actually,
[4118.05s -> 4121.38s]  yeah, we do have water. I'll take some water. Dun dun.
[4121.38s -> 4123.38s]  Dun dun. Yeah, I'm getting Solid Snake stuff ready.
[4123.38s -> 4130.91s]  So, eye patch.
[4130.91s -> 4134.56s]  Which eye does he have it on?
[4134.56s -> 4136.56s]  Does it matter? I'm so sweaty.
[4136.56s -> 4138.93s]  I'm like
[4138.93s -> 4140.93s]  sweating through these clothes.
[4140.93s -> 4159.28s]  Is it the left eye or the right eye?
[4159.28s -> 4161.28s]  I just broke the fucking eye patch.
[4161.28s -> 4165.23s]  Ow, fuck.
[4165.23s -> 4169.14s]  Yeah, I'm alright. Shit. Well, how
[4169.14s -> 4175.09s]  am I supposed to put it on now? I'll just get in front.
[4175.09s -> 4178.74s]  You just guide me. Um,
[4178.74s -> 4191.20s]  does he have a headband? Okay. I got it.
[4191.20s -> 4195.17s]  I got it. Solid Snake doesn't have an
[4195.17s -> 4200.53s]  eye patch? What? Doesn't Snake
[4200.53s -> 4203.28s]  have an eye patch? Is that like a scarf?
[4203.28s -> 4209.34s]  It's a shirt. Does he look like
[4209.34s -> 4221.74s]  this? Does he have a sword?
[4221.74s -> 4224.69s]  It's Big Boss. Is it messing
[4224.69s -> 4229.94s]  with the mic? Alright, so the idea
[4229.94s -> 4231.94s]  is that I get in this and do the Solid Snake
[4231.94s -> 4235.33s]  stuff. Alright, I'm going to try.
[4235.33s -> 4248.82s]  I hope I don't knock anything over.
[4248.82s -> 4251.25s]  Okay, so it's like
[4251.25s -> 4257.84s]  there's no way I fit in this thing.
[4257.84s -> 4317.90s]  Okay. Oh! Oh,
[4317.90s -> 4343.82s]  shit. Gotcha, gotcha,
[4343.82s -> 4346.45s]  gotcha. You thought I was a box still.
[4346.45s -> 4353.86s]  Dumbass. Oh.
[4353.86s -> 4357.54s]  I still have these on.
[4357.54s -> 4359.54s]  Oh yeah, remember Solid
[4359.54s -> 4362.16s]  Snake with his like
[4362.16s -> 4366.00s]  goblin booties? Alright,
[4366.00s -> 4370.42s]  what do we got next? Uh, yeah.
[4370.42s -> 4376.82s]  Oh god. That's going to be
[4376.82s -> 4379.31s]  hard to do. Alright, I'll do it
[4379.31s -> 4381.94s]  though. That's going to be so awful. People are
[4381.94s -> 4390.26s]  going to freak out at that one. Where are the
[4390.26s -> 4397.10s]  teeth? I'm just keeping the boots on. I don't care.
[4397.10s -> 4400.37s]  Should I like slick my hair back for this one?
[4400.37s -> 4411.10s]  Teeth? Yeah. Yeah.
[4411.10s -> 4413.73s]  Might as well get this one out of the way.
[4413.73s -> 4418.53s]  I'm just sweating. There's no way it's going to fit.
[4418.53s -> 4420.53s]  I'm going to look like such a fucking creep like
[4420.53s -> 4426.67s]  this. Should I
[4426.67s -> 4429.94s]  have? Okay, this one is called
[4429.94s -> 4433.01s]  The Vampire at the Door.
[4433.01s -> 4445.73s]  Oh, hi.
[4445.73s -> 4447.90s]  I'm new in the neighborhood.
[4447.90s -> 4449.90s]  I notice you have a really nice house.
[4449.90s -> 4452.78s]  I'd love to come in.
[4452.78s -> 4454.78s]  Could I come in?
[4454.78s -> 4457.54s]  Could I come in your house?
[4457.54s -> 4459.54s]  I'm new in the neighborhood. Me and my family
[4459.54s -> 4462.03s]  just moved in down the street.
[4462.03s -> 4464.03s]  And I'm just trying to meet the
[4464.03s -> 4467.17s]  neighbors. Just trying to meet the neighbors.
[4467.17s -> 4474.53s]  That's all. I love what you did
[4474.53s -> 4477.66s]  with the yard, by the way.
[4477.66s -> 4479.84s]  That beautiful grass. The grass
[4479.84s -> 4481.84s]  looks beautiful. How do you get it that
[4481.84s -> 4483.84s]  long? I don't know. Maybe you give me some
[4483.84s -> 4486.96s]  pointers.
[4486.96s -> 4489.33s]  Can I come in?
[4489.33s -> 4492.45s]  Let me in. Let me in your
[4492.45s -> 4494.62s]  house, please. Can I come in?
[4494.62s -> 4497.82s]  Oh, yes. Okay.
[4497.82s -> 4500.26s]  Right, of course. I had some
[4500.26s -> 4503.01s]  dental work done and they
[4503.01s -> 4505.50s]  added extra length. I
[4505.50s -> 4507.50s]  wanted width. I didn't want
[4507.50s -> 4510.26s]  length and that's what I got.
[4510.26s -> 4513.07s]  Can I come in your
[4513.07s -> 4516.19s]  house? Could I come in? Can I come in
[4516.19s -> 4519.46s]  your house? No? No?
[4519.46s -> 4521.89s]  Okay. All right. Call me.
[4521.89s -> 4524.58s]  If you want to talk, call me. Call me.
[4524.58s -> 4529.94s]  Can I come in? No?
[4529.94s -> 4533.82s]  I'll wait here until I can.
[4533.82s -> 4537.22s]  That's all good. Don't worry about it.
[4537.22s -> 4541.31s]  I barely sleep.
[4541.31s -> 4545.15s]  Good night. You want some DVDs?
[4545.15s -> 4547.46s]  You want some DVDs?
[4547.46s -> 4550.72s]  I've got a lot of DVDs. Sharknado,
[4550.72s -> 4553.28s]  for one. Loaded on DVDs.
[4553.28s -> 4560.69s]  You like drugs? Do you like drugs?
[4560.69s -> 4563.44s]  I've got a lot. Just let me
[4563.44s -> 4566.32s]  in your house and I'll give you whatever you want.
[4566.32s -> 4569.95s]  Bleed. Coke. That's all I got.
[4569.95s -> 4572.96s]  I don't got anything else.
[4572.96s -> 4577.87s]  Call me. Let me in your house.
[4577.87s -> 4580.56s]  Let me in your house. Let me in your house.
[4580.56s -> 4600.66s]  This is a fucking TikTok video.
[4600.66s -> 4606.27s]  This is a TikTok video
[4606.27s -> 4608.58s]  at this point. Can we? It's a TikTok
[4608.58s -> 4612.35s]  video. You know what? I got a perfect
[4612.35s -> 4614.35s]  here you go. Perfect, perfect video
[4614.35s -> 4616.66s]  if you want to submit it. Just add
[4616.66s -> 4618.66s]  the TikTok UI
[4618.66s -> 4621.52s]  to that whole thing and it'll be a
[4621.52s -> 4623.52s]  fucking 10 out of 10. It'll be a literal 10 out of 10.
[4623.52s -> 4626.08s]  And add music to it and
[4626.08s -> 4635.17s]  put like a little like a chat.
[4635.17s -> 4647.39s]  Do Morbentime? Okay fine.
[4647.39s -> 4653.86s]  How would he say it? I don't know. It's Morbentime!
[4653.86s -> 4658.96s]  Huh! That's kind of like Power Rangers
[4658.96s -> 4675.01s]  right? Doesn't he like
[4675.01s -> 4679.36s]  It's Morbentime!
[4679.36s -> 4681.66s]  It's Morbentime!
[4681.66s -> 4726.88s]  I'm Morbius.
[4726.88s -> 4729.06s]  Go see Morbius 2 in theaters
[4729.06s -> 4732.51s]  this July. Or
[4732.51s -> 4735.57s]  at the $5 bin
[4735.57s -> 4738.38s]  at your local Blockbuster.
[4738.38s -> 4740.38s]  Either one will do. I got paid either way.
[4740.38s -> 4748.05s]  Alright.
[4748.05s -> 4755.39s]  This man went to college.
[4755.39s -> 4757.39s]  Yeah, long time ago.
[4757.39s -> 4766.22s]  I'm still in these stupid
[4766.22s -> 4768.98s]  shoes. They're getting so dirty.
[4768.98s -> 4773.65s]  Holy shit.
[4773.65s -> 4775.65s]  You should Morb in front of the camera. I just did.
[4775.65s -> 4780.58s]  Okay. Oh my god. These are
[4780.58s -> 4785.18s]  so beat up. Say I'm Dr.
[4785.18s -> 4787.18s]  Michael Morbius.
[4787.18s -> 4791.52s]  Interested in the camera?
[4791.52s -> 4793.52s]  Actually, I probably should do some normal ones, right?
[4793.52s -> 4796.58s]  Like, hey!
[4796.58s -> 4798.82s]  Hey, what's up? How are you? Yeah.
[4798.82s -> 4800.82s]  I just moved in. Yep.
[4800.82s -> 4803.06s]  New to the neighborhood. Me.
[4803.06s -> 4805.06s]  I love your house. I love what you're doing here.
[4805.06s -> 4807.30s]  You know what I mean? I love this house.
[4807.30s -> 4809.86s]  Really, really beautiful lawn
[4809.86s -> 4811.86s]  you have, too. Yeah.
[4811.86s -> 4813.86s]  I got kids. Yeah, we all got kids, right?
[4813.86s -> 4815.86s]  Look, if you ever
[4815.86s -> 4818.61s]  it might sound weird, but if you ever want to hang out
[4818.61s -> 4820.61s]  and just kind of do something, just you and me or whatever
[4820.61s -> 4822.61s]  or we'd have to get the families together or whatever, that's fine.
[4822.61s -> 4824.61s]  Like, I would just come over. I would come over.
[4824.61s -> 4826.61s]  I would come in your house. I would come over your house.
[4826.61s -> 4828.98s]  And you'd let me in, right? Like, I would come
[4828.98s -> 4830.98s]  we'd do a thing. Would you be interested?
[4830.98s -> 4834.05s]  Okay. Okay.
[4834.05s -> 4836.05s]  Mmm.
[4836.05s -> 4838.05s]  Get some mojitos.
[4838.05s -> 4840.05s]  I make an insane mojito. You don't understand.
[4840.05s -> 4842.35s]  It's so good.
[4842.35s -> 4844.35s]  You know the trick for a mojito?
[4844.35s -> 4846.35s]  Extra mint.
[4846.35s -> 4848.35s]  People don't like the taste of mint usually.
[4848.35s -> 4850.35s]  Can I come in? Can I just come in?
[4850.35s -> 4852.85s]  Okay.
[4852.85s -> 4854.85s]  I could show you how to make a mojito the right way
[4854.85s -> 4856.85s]  and not like the way that everybody else makes it
[4856.85s -> 4858.85s]  without the extra mint.
[4858.85s -> 4860.85s]  I have to come in, though. Can I come in your house?
[4860.85s -> 4871.66s]  And that's when you do the teeth thing.
[4871.66s -> 4874.99s]  Okay. Oh, I know.
[4874.99s -> 4878.96s]  I'm sweating through this like crazy.
[4878.96s -> 4880.96s]  We're getting sweaty back.
[4880.96s -> 4883.20s]  I can't put a
[4883.20s -> 4885.20s]  clean shirt on. It would ruin everything.
[4885.20s -> 4888.59s]  Alright, fine. I'll do Goblin Time.
[4888.59s -> 4890.59s]  Jesus. Give me those.
[4890.59s -> 4899.87s]  These are perfect for Goblin Time. You're sweating.
[4899.87s -> 4902.18s]  Yeah, I know.
[4902.18s -> 4908.90s]  Alright, what do we have for Goblin Time?
[4908.90s -> 4916.64s]  You gotta look sexy.
[4916.64s -> 4919.01s]  Oh, I got you sweaty.
[4919.01s -> 4921.01s]  Oh, be careful.
[4921.01s -> 4923.01s]  Whoa, there's a lot in here.
[4923.01s -> 4925.01s]  Do I have anything else besides this? I have to put a mustache on for this.
[4925.01s -> 4932.69s]  Alright, let me get in the mirror and put this on.
[4932.69s -> 4939.98s]  Put on a twirly one.
[4939.98s -> 4953.42s]  I think this one will be alright for a little while.
[4953.42s -> 4957.14s]  Why is this a goblin? How is this a goblin?
[4957.14s -> 4959.14s]  Goblin Time?
[4959.14s -> 4963.62s]  Should I have something weird besides the two
[4963.62s -> 4967.78s]  like sacks of money?
[4967.78s -> 4969.78s]  Hey, fellas!
[4969.78s -> 4972.85s]  Now I just got in the dungeon!
[4972.85s -> 4977.33s]  Oh, yeah, that works.
[4977.33s -> 4983.09s]  I'm going to look like Barney Rubble.
[4983.09s -> 4986.48s]  Alright, I'm just going to put it on here.
[4986.48s -> 4990.00s]  I'm going to look like Barney Rubble.
[4990.00s -> 4994.03s]  In fact, this is a Barney Rubble costume.
[4994.03s -> 4998.43s]  We? Who?
[4998.43s -> 5009.17s]  I don't know who that is.
[5009.17s -> 5011.60s]  What is this going to look like?
[5011.60s -> 5015.38s]  Hey, Fred. Hey, Fred.
[5015.38s -> 5017.81s]  Oh, yeah, Fred.
[5017.81s -> 5020.93s]  That sounds fun to me, Fred.
[5020.93s -> 5022.93s]  Oh, yeah, working at the rock plant, Fred.
[5022.93s -> 5026.38s]  Yup. Okay, Fred.
[5026.38s -> 5030.21s]  That's good to hear. Good to hear, Fred.
[5030.21s -> 5033.41s]  What was I doing? Goblin Time?
[5033.41s -> 5035.41s]  Yes!
[5035.41s -> 5038.72s]  Oh!
[5038.72s -> 5040.72s]  I can't believe I stole this from those
[5040.72s -> 5043.15s]  adventurers!
[5043.15s -> 5045.52s]  What do we...
[5045.52s -> 5048.27s]  Coins! Gems!
[5048.27s -> 5050.27s]  Don't mind if I do.
[5050.27s -> 5052.27s]  Don't mind if I do.
[5054.27s -> 5056.51s]  What's this? A crown?
[5056.51s -> 5058.51s]  Whose crown could this be?
[5058.51s -> 5060.51s]  I think this is King Leonidas's.
[5060.51s -> 5062.99s]  No!
[5062.99s -> 5066.64s]  Looks like I'll be shutting off.
[5066.64s -> 5069.78s]  I hear adventurers.
[5078.22s -> 5080.22s]  Okay.
[5080.22s -> 5082.22s]  These are heavy.
[5082.22s -> 5084.53s]  The King's treasures are so heavy.
[5084.53s -> 5086.53s]  There must be so many things in here.
[5086.53s -> 5088.53s]  Let me take a look.
[5088.53s -> 5090.53s]  Let me see.
[5090.53s -> 5092.77s]  One is...
[5092.77s -> 5094.77s]  Look at...
[5094.77s -> 5096.77s]  Oh, my goodness.
[5096.77s -> 5099.39s]  So many things for me to play
[5099.39s -> 5101.39s]  with. So many things to try.
[5101.39s -> 5103.39s]  How many?
[5103.39s -> 5112.42s]  These are golden
[5112.42s -> 5115.17s]  doubloons.
[5115.17s -> 5120.16s]  The world's most valuable treasure.
[5120.16s -> 5125.73s]  I'll be taking this back to my den
[5125.73s -> 5132.13s]  immediately.
[5132.13s -> 5138.59s]  Who's that? Who's that?
[5138.59s -> 5145.17s]  Try this on for size.
[5145.17s -> 5147.47s]  Oops.
[5147.47s -> 5149.47s]  Try this on for size. A power gem.
[5152.46s -> 5154.70s]  Oh! Explosive!
[5154.70s -> 5156.70s]  Oh, another one.
[5156.70s -> 5159.84s]  What do we have here?
[5159.84s -> 5163.49s]  An explosive gem.
[5163.49s -> 5167.01s]  Oh!
[5167.01s -> 5171.04s]  Righteous!
[5171.04s -> 5173.28s]  Absolutely righteous!
[5173.28s -> 5180.32s]  I'll be off then.
[5180.32s -> 5183.39s]  Oh! Don't...
[5183.39s -> 5197.60s]  Walk from off frame?
[5197.60s -> 5203.17s]  Hold on, I gotta get all this shit out of here.
[5203.17s -> 5208.16s]  You know what? We can move to caveman after this.
[5208.16s -> 5210.16s]  A caveman wouldn't have a mustache, though.
[5210.16s -> 5215.22s]  I know. I mean, I threw them everywhere.
[5215.22s -> 5224.37s]  Isn't that what they wanted?
[5224.37s -> 5227.44s]  Isn't that what they wanted?
[5227.44s -> 5229.68s]  Okay. So I'm just sneak?
[5229.68s -> 5276.43s]  Alright, what's next? Caveman?
[5276.43s -> 5287.31s]  Grandpa? Do American Psycho.
[5287.31s -> 5291.33s]  Alright, hold on.
[5291.33s -> 5296.45s]  It's time to drink some water.
[5296.45s -> 5298.45s]  Oh, let's do this on 120 degree Vegas day!
[5298.45s -> 5306.50s]  Nah, I'm just kidding.
[5306.50s -> 5309.49s]  Hell yeah, water.
[5309.49s -> 5311.49s]  Alright, I'm gonna mute because you're gonna hear my throat muscles.
[5311.49s -> 5408.62s]  That's gross.
[5408.62s -> 5410.62s]  I can't. I don't know about this one.
[5410.62s -> 5412.80s]  I don't know about this one.
[5412.80s -> 5414.80s]  I don't know about this one.
[5414.80s -> 5418.45s]  I'm supposed to be discovering fire?
[5418.45s -> 5422.67s]  Discover fire as a caveman?
[5527.50s -> 5533.20s]  Why would he be fighting people?
[5533.20s -> 5535.20s]  Why would he?
[5535.20s -> 5537.57s]  He's just beating the shit out of everybody else?
[5537.57s -> 5539.81s]  He's just so fucked up that he can't handle it?
[5539.81s -> 5549.28s]  They're stealing it.
[5549.28s -> 5555.30s]  Beating up a dinosaur.
[5604.72s -> 5623.28s]  The caveman wears jeans.
[5623.28s -> 5633.07s]  This is what you do in your spare time?
[5633.07s -> 5635.57s]  Yeah, kind of.
[5635.57s -> 5646.77s]  That's kind of what we're doing right now.
[5646.77s -> 5649.46s]  Alright, give me a sec. Costume change.
[5649.46s -> 5740.96s]  Alright, just drinking some water.
[5740.96s -> 5744.29s]  So what do we got? We got cashier.
[5744.29s -> 5746.98s]  Yeah, we'll do artist.
[5746.98s -> 5761.62s]  So this is artist?
[5761.62s -> 5769.17s]  What should I do for a mustache?
[5769.17s -> 5771.17s]  I can't wait to do that. That's gonna be so fun.
[5771.17s -> 5782.24s]  Should I get these out of the way?
[5782.24s -> 5789.22s]  Just cause they're here.
[5800.27s -> 5802.27s]  Do the guitarist. Yeah, I'm gonna do the music stuff right now.
[5802.27s -> 5807.52s]  I can't believe I twerked as the caveman.
[5809.76s -> 5811.76s]  You find fire so you twerk.
[5813.76s -> 5817.09s]  That feels like a Geico commercial, doesn't it?
[5825.15s -> 5827.15s]  Alright, so I'm just gonna do this from various angles.
[5827.15s -> 5831.76s]  This shirt is gonna be a different shade of gray.
[5831.76s -> 5841.62s]  It's gonna be so wet.
[5841.62s -> 5855.04s]  Alright, coming back.
[5855.04s -> 5860.67s]  Okay, this one's gonna be interesting.
[5860.67s -> 5871.42s]  So this one's play the piano in a band.
[5871.42s -> 5876.35s]  Alright, let's see what I can do.
[5876.35s -> 5897.41s]  I should probably be sitting down for this.
[5897.41s -> 5899.41s]  You probably all just heard that, that's fine.
[5899.41s -> 5906.62s]  Alright, here we go.
[5906.62s -> 5909.12s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen, thank you. Thanks for coming out.
[5909.12s -> 5911.36s]  Yeah, we got a new song that we're gonna play for you here.
[5911.36s -> 5915.70s]  What was that?
[5915.70s -> 5917.87s]  I think I just dropped a jam out of my pocket.
[5917.87s -> 5919.87s]  Well, maybe I should trade it in.
[5919.87s -> 5921.87s]  Alright, yeah, we're gonna play a new song.
[5921.87s -> 5923.87s]  This one is something we've been working on for a long time.
[5923.87s -> 5926.05s]  I hope you all enjoy it.
[5926.05s -> 5928.93s]  It doesn't have a name, it's currently untitled.
[5928.93s -> 5930.93s]  So that's what we're gonna do.
[5930.93s -> 5932.93s]  It's an untitled song, and I hope you enjoy it.
[5932.93s -> 5934.93s]  Maybe you can help us come up with a title after the end of the show.
[5934.93s -> 5938.13s]  It's gonna be peppy, it's gonna be a lot of upbeat.
[5938.13s -> 5940.82s]  So I'll hopefully see somebody out there dancing.
[5940.82s -> 5946.34s]  Okay, and a one, two, a one, two, three, four.
[5946.34s -> 5985.54s]  Okay, alright now, speed it up.
[5985.54s -> 6000.50s]  Yeah, thank you.
[6000.50s -> 6003.18s]  Thank you so much.
[6003.18s -> 6005.18s]  No, sit down, sit down.
[6005.18s -> 6008.00s]  No reason for that.
[6008.00s -> 6010.37s]  Okay, if you're gonna stand.
[6010.37s -> 6012.99s]  Thank you, wow, thank you.
[6012.99s -> 6016.45s]  We've been working on that for like, what, two weeks?
[6016.45s -> 6019.39s]  Three weeks now.
[6019.39s -> 6022.46s]  Yeah, John came up with the lyrics.
[6022.46s -> 6024.46s]  You don't have to stand.
[6024.46s -> 6026.46s]  Sit down, sit down, no, sit down.
[6026.46s -> 6029.79s]  Alright, okay, thank you.
[6029.79s -> 6034.38s]  Thank you.
[6034.38s -> 6036.38s]  This thing's clearly inflatable.
[6036.38s -> 6038.38s]  Alright, let's do the next one with the fucking guitar.
[6038.38s -> 6045.55s]  Sitting or standing, what do you think?
[6045.55s -> 6051.63s]  I should probably be up for this.
[6051.63s -> 6056.61s]  Probably standing, right?
[6056.61s -> 6062.62s]  Stand, yeah, yeah, this is the guitar.
[6062.62s -> 6068.62s]  Look, I didn't, I'm not gonna go
[6068.62s -> 6072.62s]  and buy like a $500 acoustic guitar.
[6072.62s -> 6082.10s]  It looks fine on camera, it looks alright.
[6082.10s -> 6088.22s]  So do you think knee?
[6088.22s -> 6092.18s]  Knee like this probably, like that.
[6092.18s -> 6142.67s]  So it's gonna be like bang.
[6142.67s -> 6151.57s]  You can use this part if you want.
[6151.57s -> 6156.54s]  Didn't like ACDC do this shit?
[6156.54s -> 6161.86s]  ACDC would be like,
[6161.86s -> 6189.50s]  wait, what, we still have close ups?
[6189.50s -> 6236.64s]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[6236.64s -> 6242.27s]  Alright, any more instruments?
[6242.27s -> 6245.47s]  Should I play the accordion when I have like
[6245.47s -> 6258.98s]  the chef outfit on?
[6258.98s -> 6267.17s]  Okay, we'll do struggling to open a jar.
[6267.17s -> 6269.17s]  Give me, give me it, I got it, give it to me.
[6269.17s -> 6273.95s]  God.
[6273.95s -> 6278.50s]  You may get a little bit work in here, but alright.
[6282.72s -> 6285.41s]  Put your sink on.
[6285.41s -> 6290.85s]  Hot water, works.
[6290.85s -> 6296.16s]  What did you fucking do to this thing?
[6296.16s -> 6305.12s]  I'm gonna break the jar if I keep doing that.
[6305.12s -> 6307.12s]  Do you have one of those things you can open it with
[6307.12s -> 6312.50s]  like a bottle opener thing?
[6312.50s -> 6321.84s]  You can't look at me, don't look at me while I do it.
[6321.84s -> 6323.84s]  Don't look at me when I try to do it, cause I get nervous.
[6328.51s -> 6330.51s]  I'm just sweating.
[6330.51s -> 6332.51s]  It's already open.
[6332.51s -> 6336.86s]  Huh.
[6336.86s -> 6339.30s]  Now that's interesting, isn't it?
[6339.30s -> 6344.66s]  Ship was already open.
[6344.66s -> 6346.66s]  Ah, there it is.
[6346.66s -> 6349.02s]  There it is.
[6349.02s -> 6351.02s]  See, I can do it, I can open jars.
[6351.02s -> 6362.02s]  I'm strong.
[6362.02s -> 6367.90s]  Nice back.
[6367.90s -> 6371.81s]  Nice back sweat.
[6371.81s -> 6373.81s]  Somebody said you let out the wasps.
[6375.81s -> 6382.19s]  Oh, that's a good one, alright.
[6382.19s -> 6386.74s]  Well, I gotta be in the gray
[6386.74s -> 6388.74s]  in the jeans to match all the other
[6388.74s -> 6393.86s]  things.
[6393.86s -> 6395.86s]  Oh yeah, this is gonna bounce around if I do that.
[6395.86s -> 6398.03s]  Actually, it should go inside.
[6398.03s -> 6400.72s]  Yeah, let me mute for a second
[6400.72s -> 6404.30s]  cause I wanna put this back in.
[6404.30s -> 6406.30s]  These little things are great, these things are awesome.
[6406.30s -> 6421.15s]  One sec.
[6421.15s -> 6427.81s]  Somebody said back piss.
[6427.81s -> 6430.75s]  Do a western standoff, okay.
[6430.75s -> 6432.93s]  Oh, that's already one, okay.
[6432.93s -> 6434.93s]  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff that we're gonna be going through.
[6434.93s -> 6439.09s]  And I got plenty of time, so I don't wanna like
[6439.09s -> 6441.09s]  rush through everything and get like
[6441.09s -> 6443.09s]  winded in three hours.
[6443.09s -> 6445.09s]  We're here for like five hours, so there's a lot of
[6445.09s -> 6452.13s]  shit I'm gonna do.
[6452.13s -> 6457.44s]  Should I do the artist stuff right now?
[6457.44s -> 6460.38s]  I think that makes sense.
[6460.38s -> 6462.38s]  Oh, the scout ton. How do you do it?
[6462.38s -> 6466.03s]  You check your pulse.
[6466.03s -> 6472.29s]  So I'm like, I'm not even winded.
[6472.29s -> 6481.76s]  Oh, I need a head.
[6481.76s -> 6497.10s]  Oh, headphones, yeah.
[6497.10s -> 6499.10s]  That's gonna look so funny.
[6499.10s -> 6532.75s]  I'm not even winded. What's the engineer stuff?
[6532.75s -> 6537.49s]  Oh, should I just be like on a construction yard?
[6537.49s -> 6544.40s]  Oh my god, super fucking Mario.
[6546.64s -> 6549.39s]  Super Mario?
[6549.39s -> 6551.39s]  A guard hat?
[6551.39s -> 6553.63s]  Wait, hold on, hold on.
[6553.63s -> 6555.63s]  Alright.
[6555.63s -> 6557.63s]  Super, I'm gonna be Super Mario
[6557.63s -> 6559.63s]  with a, this is gonna be
[6559.63s -> 6563.28s]  fucked up, isn't it?
[6563.28s -> 6565.28s]  Alright, let me change. Let's get the Mario shit
[6565.28s -> 6569.57s]  out of the way. Costume change.
[6569.57s -> 6572.83s]  Do a backwards long jump.
[6572.83s -> 6576.03s]  Oh, you better believe it.
[6576.03s -> 6579.10s]  I'm gonna do all the speed run shit.
[6579.10s -> 6799.52s]  I'll be right back. Hold on a second.
[6799.52s -> 6801.52s]  What is this costume?
[6801.52s -> 6803.76s]  What the fuck
[6803.76s -> 6805.76s]  is this costume?
[6805.76s -> 6807.76s]  This is a Super Mario costume. Why is it
[6807.76s -> 6810.19s]  like this?
[6810.19s -> 6812.19s]  Okay, well,
[6812.19s -> 6814.19s]  I'm
[6814.19s -> 6843.12s]  muting. Oh, this is fucked up.
[6843.12s -> 6845.12s]  This is fucked up.
[6845.12s -> 6847.12s]  Alright, I'm back. Can you guys hear me?
[6847.12s -> 6849.12s]  Where's the hat?
[6849.12s -> 6851.81s]  Is it the engineer or do you want the Mario hat?
[6851.81s -> 6853.81s]  It's just the Mario shit. This is way too
[6853.81s -> 6855.81s]  low. This is weird.
[6855.81s -> 6860.35s]  Alright, what was it?
[6860.35s -> 6862.35s]  I need a Mario mustache.
[6862.35s -> 6864.35s]  And I gotta get the voice down too, like, oh!
[6864.35s -> 6866.66s]  Whoa! Whoa!
[6866.66s -> 6869.34s]  It's a me!
[6869.34s -> 6872.03s]  Mario! Hello!
[6872.03s -> 6875.22s]  Oh! Oh!
[6875.22s -> 6877.90s]  Okie dokie!
[6877.90s -> 6882.06s]  Hello!
[6882.06s -> 6884.06s]  This is my big role. This is my big break.
[6884.06s -> 6886.43s]  I feel like I'm in the wings
[6886.43s -> 6888.43s]  during a theater production.
[6888.43s -> 6891.31s]  And they just, like, the kids can't wait
[6891.31s -> 6896.11s]  to watch me.
[6896.11s -> 6898.11s]  Should this be this, I feel like, I'm like in a clown
[6898.11s -> 6903.49s]  costume. I'm just gonna wear
[6903.49s -> 6906.43s]  socks. I don't even care.
[6906.43s -> 6908.43s]  How does it go? Like this? Does it go up or down?
[6908.43s -> 6910.86s]  Like that? No, no,
[6910.86s -> 6912.86s]  the other way. Oh, can you help me? Yeah.
[6912.86s -> 6917.02s]  It goes like that? Yeah. Alright.
[6917.02s -> 6919.90s]  Are you needed? No. Oh.
[6919.90s -> 6931.92s]  Oh no. Hello!
[6931.92s -> 6933.92s]  You should be in bare feet.
[6933.92s -> 6936.29s]  No!
[6936.29s -> 6938.29s]  That's wicked funny though.
[6938.29s -> 6940.29s]  That's wicked funny.
[6940.29s -> 6942.29s]  He's in bare feet.
[6944.29s -> 6950.67s]  Oh. Just bare
[6950.67s -> 6954.51s]  ass feet. Okay, how's that look?
[6954.51s -> 6958.91s]  Do I look alright?
[6958.91s -> 6961.09s]  Yeah, it's a little scorched.
[6961.09s -> 6963.09s]  It looks like I have, I don't, this is like
[6963.09s -> 6965.71s]  down too low. This looks
[6965.71s -> 6968.46s]  inappropriate.
[6968.46s -> 6970.46s]  This looks inappropriate.
[6970.46s -> 6972.90s]  Doesn't this look inappropriate?
[6972.90s -> 6977.44s]  This is inappropriate. Oh, hello!
[6977.44s -> 6979.44s]  It's a me, Mario!
[6979.44s -> 6981.44s]  Oh! Okie dokie!
[6981.44s -> 6983.44s]  Oh! Ha ha!
[6983.44s -> 6985.44s]  Hee hee! Oh! Bingo!
[6985.44s -> 6987.44s]  Oh! Ha ha! Hee hee!
[6987.44s -> 6993.97s]  Ho ho! Oh!
[6993.97s -> 6996.59s]  Where's Luigi? Where's
[6996.59s -> 7001.84s]  Luigi? Can we get this out?
[7001.84s -> 7008.62s]  So what are some of the, I gotta, okay,
[7008.62s -> 7013.81s]  let me do some Mario stuff. Alright.
[7013.81s -> 7019.81s]  Hoo! Hoo!
[7019.81s -> 7022.43s]  It's like, meep!
[7022.43s -> 7024.43s]  Meahoo! Take that audio.
[7024.43s -> 7028.83s]  Meahoo! Meahoo!
[7028.83s -> 7032.03s]  Take that audio. And it's like
[7032.03s -> 7043.94s]  Hoo! Meahoo! Meahoo!
[7043.94s -> 7046.56s]  Meahoo!
[7046.56s -> 7049.95s]  I'm probably fucking up this audio so bad.
[7049.95s -> 7055.52s]  Meahoo! Meahoo!
[7055.52s -> 7057.52s]  Meahoo!
[7057.52s -> 7063.65s]  Hoo!
[7063.65s -> 7074.66s]  BLJs! Be careful!
[7074.66s -> 7076.66s]  I've got a big stomach, I'll be fine!
[7076.66s -> 7083.42s]  Alright, let's get some walking.
[7083.42s -> 7086.29s]  I'm gonna burp. And I can't hide it.
[7086.29s -> 7095.50s]  Hoo! Meahoo! Okie dokie!
[7095.50s -> 7100.61s]  Oh no! Bowser!
[7100.61s -> 7119.47s]  Bowser!
[7119.47s -> 7121.47s]  Meahoo! Kicka coo! Meahoo!
[7121.47s -> 7123.71s]  Kicka coo! Meahoo!
[7123.71s -> 7126.40s]  Kicka coo! Meahoo!
[7126.40s -> 7129.66s]  Fuck outta here! Sit the fuck down,
[7129.66s -> 7131.66s]  Bowser! Kicka coo! Meahoo,
[7131.66s -> 7136.78s]  motherfucker! Okie dokie!
[7136.78s -> 7164.48s]  Alright, let's get in the Mario Kart.
[7164.48s -> 7167.10s]  Do we have a steering wheel?
[7167.10s -> 7176.58s]  It's a circle.
[7176.58s -> 7179.65s]  Oh, nah, I'll just hold it
[7179.65s -> 7183.28s]  like this. How's it, does it look good?
[7183.28s -> 7190.58s]  This is kinda comfy, I like this.
[7190.58s -> 7193.78s]  Do we look alright? I'll do a bunch from the other side too.
[7200.75s -> 7211.63s]  Alright, I gotta center. I've got
[7211.63s -> 7214.64s]  to center, I've got to center.
[7214.64s -> 7217.97s]  Ok, welcome to Mario Kart.
[7217.97s -> 7219.97s]  I'll select your player.
[7219.97s -> 7222.40s]  It's me, Mario.
[7222.40s -> 7229.87s]  Here we go!
[7242.02s -> 7244.90s]  This is a big turn!
[7255.57s -> 7261.97s]  Bingo!
[7261.97s -> 7266.83s]  It's a red shell!
[7280.45s -> 7290.48s]  This is very
[7290.48s -> 7293.04s]  hard on Mario. This is a hard
[7293.04s -> 7295.41s]  car to drive. Mario!
[7295.41s -> 7302.18s]  Mario!
[7311.84s -> 7315.98s]  Very close!
[7315.98s -> 7328.21s]  Very close! Here I go!
[7328.21s -> 7330.21s]  Here I go! Here I go!
[7330.21s -> 7332.21s]  Here I go! Here I go! Here I go!
[7332.21s -> 7337.71s]  Oh, mamma mia!
[7337.71s -> 7345.38s]  Hey, Toad! You little shit!
[7345.38s -> 7351.23s]  Hey, Toad! I'm
[7351.23s -> 7353.23s]  passing you again for the third time this race!
[7357.78s -> 7363.33s]  Oh, no!
[7363.33s -> 7367.55s]  Mario need an alibi!
[7367.55s -> 7379.50s]  Oh! Oh, yes!
[7379.50s -> 7382.13s]  Oh, I'm selling
[7382.13s -> 7384.37s]  Cookie Monster. I'm doing Cookie Monster,
[7384.37s -> 7386.37s]  not even Mario. Alright, reset.
[7386.37s -> 7391.49s]  Three, two, oh, just here I go!
[7391.49s -> 7393.49s]  Oh, I love
[7393.49s -> 7395.49s]  cookies! Oh, cookies!
[7395.49s -> 7402.08s]  Let's see if you can
[7402.08s -> 7419.74s]  deal with this! Mario will drive
[7419.74s -> 7432.02s]  on his feet!
[7432.02s -> 7437.65s]  Get away!
[7437.65s -> 7440.98s]  Get this away from me!
[7440.98s -> 7445.58s]  Oh!
[7445.58s -> 7456.85s]  Super moves!
[7456.85s -> 7486.34s]  Toad! What else do you want from me?
[7486.34s -> 7492.67s]  Hotel Mario? What the fuck?
[7492.67s -> 7501.94s]  Walk in? Oh, okay.
[7501.94s -> 7507.87s]  No! No!
[7507.87s -> 7510.05s]  No! How do you do it?
[7510.05s -> 7513.44s]  It's like, no! She's looking at me
[7513.44s -> 7517.02s]  like I'm fucking crazy. No!
[7517.02s -> 7526.11s]  Toaster goes in
[7526.11s -> 7528.11s]  the toaster! Toast
[7528.11s -> 7530.11s]  no! Toast goes in the
[7530.11s -> 7532.11s]  toaster! Is that in the same thing?
[7532.11s -> 7539.39s]  Is that in that? Tuck that in?
[7539.39s -> 7543.49s]  There's a tag!
[7543.49s -> 7545.73s]  There's this song?
[7545.73s -> 7550.34s]  When you do the Mario, it's
[7550.34s -> 7552.34s]  swing your arms from side to side.
[7552.34s -> 7554.34s]  Come on, it's time to go! Do the
[7554.34s -> 7566.94s]  Mario! Okay.
[7566.94s -> 7568.94s]  Swing your arms from
[7568.94s -> 7570.94s]  side to side. Come on, and everyone
[7570.94s -> 7572.94s]  go do the Mario! Swing your
[7572.94s -> 7574.94s]  arms from side to side.
[7574.94s -> 7576.94s]  Come on, let's go! Let's do the Mario!
[7576.94s -> 7581.42s]  Is that the Mario for you?
[7581.42s -> 7583.60s]  Yeah, who that one?
[7583.60s -> 7585.60s]  Hey, yeah, who that one?
[7585.60s -> 7591.17s]  Bowser. Does he go like this?
[7591.17s -> 7603.71s]  He's like, I don't know the whole song.
[7603.71s -> 7609.86s]  Any more Mario shit?
[7609.86s -> 7615.36s]  The accordion is Mario?
[7615.36s -> 7619.52s]  Wait.
[7619.52s -> 7622.21s]  Hold on.
[7622.21s -> 7624.21s]  I wrote this song
[7624.21s -> 7653.82s]  for Luigi.
[7653.82s -> 7655.82s]  And every single person watching
[7655.82s -> 7657.82s]  wanted to turn the audio off.
[7657.82s -> 7664.16s]  That was for you, Luigi.
[7664.16s -> 7666.16s]  I can't wait to be the annoying waiter.
[7666.16s -> 7668.16s]  He'll be like, oh,
[7668.16s -> 7672.06s]  how are you?
[7672.06s -> 7674.06s]  And I'll take an extra tip, by the way.
[7674.06s -> 7676.06s]  At least 60 percent.
[7676.06s -> 7692.24s]  Enjoy your dinner.
[7692.24s -> 7698.06s]  Any more Mario?
[7698.06s -> 7700.06s]  The car's just in the corner.
[7700.06s -> 7703.01s]  You already just did this, right?
[7703.01s -> 7706.02s]  Yeah, go up the stairs.
[7706.02s -> 7708.02s]  Do you want Mario drug PSA?
[7708.02s -> 7715.42s]  Biyahoo!
[7715.42s -> 7717.42s]  Biyahoo! Biyahoo!
[7717.42s -> 7721.33s]  Bwah!
[7721.33s -> 7723.89s]  Hi, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Super Mario.
[7723.89s -> 7726.96s]  We've made a lot of jokes here today.
[7726.96s -> 7728.96s]  We've had a lot of fun. And I'm an actor.
[7728.96s -> 7731.71s]  But let me just be the first to tell you
[7731.71s -> 7733.71s]  that, you know, it's not fun. What is not
[7733.71s -> 7737.17s]  is totally biyahoo. Drugs
[7737.17s -> 7740.11s]  and alcohol. Stay away from them.
[7740.11s -> 7742.86s]  If somebody tries to pressure you
[7742.86s -> 7744.86s]  into drinking or smoking,
[7744.86s -> 7747.30s]  tell them with the hardest
[7747.30s -> 7749.30s]  of hearts, no,
[7749.30s -> 7752.50s]  I don't need to do that. We can get back
[7752.50s -> 7755.76s]  to the playing and games now.
[7755.76s -> 7757.76s]  But I wanted to make sure that that was a big biyahoo.
[7757.76s -> 7760.51s]  Biyahoo! Biyahoo!
[7760.51s -> 7762.69s]  I saw you laughing in the corner.
[7762.69s -> 7764.69s]  What's wrong?
[7764.69s -> 7766.69s]  What's wrong with me?
[7766.69s -> 7768.69s]  What's wrong?
[7768.69s -> 7770.69s]  What's wrong with me?
[7770.69s -> 7772.69s]  I thought I had like residue on my face.
[7772.69s -> 7774.69s]  Okay.
[7774.69s -> 7776.69s]  Let me try again. One more time. One more time.
[7776.69s -> 7786.93s]  Bwah! Bwah!
[7786.93s -> 7790.58s]  Biyahoo! Biyahoo!
[7790.58s -> 7796.34s]  Hi, boys and girls.
[7796.34s -> 7799.26s]  I'm Jeremy Albertson, aka
[7799.26s -> 7801.26s]  the actor of Super Mario.
[7801.26s -> 7804.21s]  But you know what's not biyahoo?
[7804.21s -> 7806.64s]  And what's not cool? Drugs and alcohol.
[7806.64s -> 7809.14s]  If somebody pressures you
[7809.14s -> 7811.14s]  into smoking or drinking,
[7811.14s -> 7813.87s]  tell them no.
[7813.87s -> 7816.05s]  And you can tell them so long.
[7816.05s -> 7818.67s]  So long, King Bowser.
[7818.67s -> 7821.55s]  Take it from me.
[7821.55s -> 7823.55s]  I live a pretty cool life, don't you think?
[7823.55s -> 7826.05s]  Fuck!
[7826.05s -> 7828.05s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7828.05s -> 7833.54s]  One more, one more, one more, one more.
[7833.54s -> 7835.71s]  Oh! Bowser!
[7835.71s -> 7837.71s]  It's a Bowser!
[7837.71s -> 7839.71s]  Biyahoo! Biyahoo!
[7839.71s -> 7845.86s]  Woah!
[7845.86s -> 7848.67s]  You know what's not funny? Something that's not completely
[7848.67s -> 7852.30s]  biyahoo. Drugs and alcohol.
[7852.30s -> 7854.30s]  Hi, everybody. I'm the actor that plays
[7854.30s -> 7856.30s]  Super Mario, and I just want to make sure that everyone's aware
[7856.30s -> 7858.30s]  if you're ever pressured
[7858.30s -> 7860.30s]  by drugs, alcohol,
[7860.30s -> 7862.30s]  or anything naughty at all,
[7862.30s -> 7864.48s]  say no.
[7864.48s -> 7866.48s]  There's no pressure at all.
[7866.48s -> 7868.66s]  Don't let somebody pressure you
[7868.66s -> 7871.60s]  into taking something you don't want to do.
[7871.60s -> 7874.74s]  And with that, it's time to so long, King Bowser.
[7874.74s -> 7879.34s]  Woah!
[7879.34s -> 7883.12s]  Woah!
[7883.12s -> 7885.12s]  You can use one of those.
[7885.12s -> 7892.61s]  Whatever you want to use it for.
[7892.61s -> 7894.61s]  Do one in Mario character?
[7894.61s -> 7896.85s]  Okay. Okay, alright.
[7896.85s -> 7901.58s]  Okay.
[7901.58s -> 7903.58s]  Oh, god damn it. Alright, I'll try.
[7908.00s -> 7921.28s]  Biyahoo!
[7921.28s -> 7924.22s]  Mustache is so fucked up.
[7924.22s -> 7926.78s]  Okay, I think it's on.
[7926.78s -> 7929.79s]  I got it.
[7929.79s -> 7931.79s]  Biyahoo! Biyahoo!
[7931.79s -> 7936.85s]  Bowser!
[7936.85s -> 7942.16s]  Oh, boy.
[7942.16s -> 7944.16s]  It's impossible. I think it actually
[7944.16s -> 7946.59s]  might be impossible.
[7946.59s -> 7948.77s]  I'll give it one more try.
[7948.77s -> 7950.77s]  Oh, fuck. Okay.
[7950.77s -> 7953.46s]  I gotta like, just shut up and get into it.
[7953.46s -> 7956.14s]  God damn it.
[7956.14s -> 7962.03s]  Because I just imagine watching this on TV
[7962.03s -> 7964.03s]  and it's just like, it's so stupid.
[7964.03s -> 7968.64s]  Biyahoo!
[7968.64s -> 7970.64s]  Biyahoo!
[7970.64s -> 7973.44s]  Oh, Bowser!
[7973.44s -> 7975.44s]  Ha ha ha ha!
[7975.44s -> 7977.92s]  Oh!
[7977.92s -> 7979.92s]  Boys and girls, it's a me,
[7979.92s -> 7982.42s]  Mario. Let me tell you
[7982.42s -> 7984.78s]  something. If somebody wants to tell
[7984.78s -> 7987.09s]  you to take drugs,
[7987.09s -> 7989.33s]  you always say no. You say,
[7989.33s -> 7991.33s]  Luigi, try to drink
[7991.33s -> 7993.33s]  and do drugs one time.
[7993.33s -> 7995.33s]  And I said, no! And he said,
[7995.33s -> 7997.63s]  Mario! And I said, no!
[7997.63s -> 7999.63s]  Fucking god damn it.
[7999.63s -> 8001.63s]  The mustache came off.
[8001.63s -> 8007.20s]  That one was the one,
[8007.20s -> 8009.20s]  too. That was the take.
[8009.20s -> 8011.20s]  And I could feel it come off.
[8011.20s -> 8014.40s]  Oh, fuck. I could feel it
[8014.40s -> 8020.74s]  come off. Alright, I'm gonna give this one
[8020.74s -> 8023.74s]  more attempt and we have to move on.
[8023.74s -> 8028.91s]  I'm so sweaty. Okay.
[8028.91s -> 8032.86s]  Hello!
[8032.86s -> 8038.56s]  Okay, you can do this, Mario.
[8038.56s -> 8042.00s]  You can do this, Mario.
[8042.00s -> 8044.00s]  Biyahoo! Biyahoo!
[8044.00s -> 8048.85s]  Bowser! Hello, boys
[8048.85s -> 8051.02s]  and girls. It's a me, Mario.
[8051.02s -> 8053.78s]  Let me tell you something
[8053.78s -> 8056.78s]  about drugs and alcohol. My brother
[8056.78s -> 8058.78s]  Luigi would also say this,
[8058.78s -> 8061.09s]  too. We both would say this.
[8061.09s -> 8065.30s]  Shit!
[8065.30s -> 8067.78s]  Biyahoo!
[8067.78s -> 8071.62s]  I gotta give it more than that.
[8071.62s -> 8074.43s]  Biyahoo! Biyahoo!
[8074.43s -> 8077.06s]  Bowser! I'll deal with you later.
[8077.06s -> 8080.50s]  Hello! Boys and girls.
[8080.50s -> 8082.50s]  It's a me, Mario.
[8082.50s -> 8084.99s]  Let me tell you something about...
[8084.99s -> 8089.02s]  Just cut them together, okay?
[8089.02s -> 8093.06s]  Let me tell you something about
[8093.06s -> 8095.55s]  drugs and alcohol.
[8095.55s -> 8097.55s]  You should never take any drugs.
[8097.55s -> 8099.55s]  Never. Mario wouldn't. Luigi
[8099.55s -> 8103.20s]  wouldn't. Toad? Maybe.
[8103.20s -> 8105.44s]  But we don't need to talk
[8105.44s -> 8107.44s]  about Toad. Oh!
[8107.44s -> 8111.86s]  Oh!
[8111.86s -> 8114.03s]  It's a me, Mario. I want to talk to you
[8114.03s -> 8116.34s]  about drugs. Boys and girls,
[8116.34s -> 8118.34s]  don't do drugs.
[8118.34s -> 8120.34s]  You don't have to do them. Don't feel
[8120.34s -> 8122.34s]  pressured to take drugs or drink.
[8122.34s -> 8124.34s]  If anyone ever pressures you,
[8124.34s -> 8126.34s]  tell them Mario said,
[8126.34s -> 8128.34s]  so long, King Bowser, and they will
[8128.34s -> 8130.34s]  leave you alone. No!
[8130.34s -> 8132.34s]  Hello!
[8132.34s -> 8134.34s]  It's a me, Mario.
[8134.34s -> 8136.34s]  I have to do a drug
[8136.34s -> 8138.34s]  PSA. Okay. I'm done.
[8138.34s -> 8140.34s]  I can't.
[8140.34s -> 8142.64s]  I can't do it. I can't. That was
[8142.64s -> 8145.26s]  the end.
[8145.26s -> 8147.26s]  He's on drugs.
[8147.26s -> 8149.82s]  He's on drugs.
[8149.82s -> 8151.82s]  He's like
[8151.82s -> 8153.82s]  fucked up. He's fucking crazy.
[8153.82s -> 8155.82s]  He's running around like a psychopath.
[8155.82s -> 8157.82s]  He's
[8157.82s -> 8160.00s]  on something. Oh my
[8160.00s -> 8166.83s]  God.
[8166.83s -> 8169.84s]  Do the Bowser throw?
[8169.84s -> 8174.90s]  Alright, fine.
[8174.90s -> 8176.90s]  Yahoo!
[8182.48s -> 8187.22s]  So long, King Bowser!
[8187.22s -> 8189.22s]  And somebody that's King Bowser needs
[8189.22s -> 8191.52s]  to understand. Boys and girls,
[8191.52s -> 8193.82s]  don't do drugs. If you do
[8193.82s -> 8195.82s]  drugs, you'll end up like King
[8195.82s -> 8198.51s]  Bowser over there. Dead.
[8198.51s -> 8205.68s]  Is he dead? I don't know.
[8213.86s -> 8218.46s]  So long.
[8218.46s -> 8220.46s]  Is that what he said?
[8220.46s -> 8224.48s]  Oh my God.
[8224.48s -> 8226.48s]  Alright, any more Mario shooters? Is that it?
[8226.48s -> 8230.45s]  So long, King Bowser.
[8230.45s -> 8235.63s]  Anything else
[8235.63s -> 8239.28s]  we want to do as Mario? Happy Pride Month.
[8239.28s -> 8241.58s]  Yeah, it's the last day of Pride Month, right?
[8241.58s -> 8243.58s]  Oh my God, I'm going to take the whole thing down,
[8243.58s -> 8245.58s]  Luigi.
[8245.58s -> 8247.58s]  Luigi, I almost just took down the whole
[8247.58s -> 8251.09s]  camera.
[8251.09s -> 8254.22s]  Did it move? I don't think it did, right?
[8254.22s -> 8258.45s]  Let's just make sure you can still see me.
[8258.45s -> 8260.45s]  Did the camera move? Maybe they
[8260.45s -> 8264.16s]  can tell you. Did it move or are we good?
[8264.16s -> 8276.86s]  How about now? Am I good here?
[8276.86s -> 8281.98s]  Okay, good. So, that's fine.
[8287.97s -> 8298.98s]  Any more Mario stuff before we move on?
[8298.98s -> 8302.82s]  Lose a life? Do a ground pound,
[8302.82s -> 8304.82s]  okay. Yeah, I keep trying to go this
[8304.82s -> 8306.82s]  I'm so stupid. I keep trying to go
[8306.82s -> 8309.95s]  to the left. Okay, ground pound.
[8309.95s -> 8314.67s]  So it's like,
[8314.67s -> 8317.66s]  like that?
[8317.66s -> 8346.26s]  Like, Luigi. I'm fucking
[8346.26s -> 8349.20s]  done with this job. Never fucking doing Mario
[8349.20s -> 8357.38s]  ever again.
[8357.38s -> 8359.38s]  No, I can't. I can't.
[8359.38s -> 8361.38s]  So what is that? What is that
[8361.38s -> 8363.81s]  image of? I hate this. It's a fucking
[8363.81s -> 8365.81s]  pregnant Mario thing.
[8365.81s -> 8367.81s]  Oh my God.
[8367.81s -> 8371.78s]  That's a meme. That's a meme
[8371.78s -> 8374.72s]  right there. Whoopsie daisy.
[8374.72s -> 8379.84s]  Whoopsie. Alright, so should I
[8379.84s -> 8382.02s]  do the hard hat Mario? Wait, wasn't
[8382.02s -> 8388.54s]  this like Mario Odyssey?
[8388.54s -> 8392.05s]  Hey, look, bud. I'm an
[8392.05s -> 8394.67s]  engineer. That means I solve problems.
[8394.67s -> 8396.91s]  I solve practical problems.
[8396.91s -> 8402.67s]  So wait, does the mustache
[8402.67s -> 8406.58s]  off as the engineer? I guess that's
[8406.58s -> 8414.13s]  true, right? Build a sentry
[8414.13s -> 8420.27s]  That's Mario? This stomach
[8420.27s -> 8422.27s]  is going to get me in a lot of trouble.
[8422.27s -> 8425.90s]  Oh, hey, look, bud.
[8425.90s -> 8432.67s]  Sentry going up. Glasses?
[8432.67s -> 8440.48s]  Oh, yeah. Uh, these ones are good.
[8440.48s -> 8446.42s]  God damn it.
[8446.42s -> 8449.36s]  Damn it. Oh, damn it.
[8449.36s -> 8454.91s]  Sentry going up.
[8454.91s -> 8456.91s]  Good night, Irene.
[8456.91s -> 8464.13s]  Building a dispenser. I'm going to push
[8464.13s -> 8467.97s]  that car. Teleporter going up.
[8467.97s -> 8473.20s]  Ow. Ow my leg.
[8473.20s -> 8479.28s]  Let's get a teleporter
[8479.28s -> 8486.51s]  up here.
[8488.51s -> 8493.38s]  Ha ha ha.
[8493.38s -> 8495.38s]  Ha ha ha.
[8495.38s -> 8507.97s]  Guitar?
[8507.97s -> 8511.30s]  Oh, sitting down.
[8511.30s -> 8513.30s]  Sentry down. Oh, alright, yeah. Let's do that.
[8513.30s -> 8521.66s]  Sentry down.
[8521.66s -> 8524.35s]  I can do better.
[8524.35s -> 8528.06s]  Hey, let me do it like every player does.
[8528.06s -> 8532.19s]  Right.
[8532.19s -> 8537.82s]  Sentry down.
[8537.82s -> 8558.03s]  What's next? Oh, get backstabbed?
[8558.03s -> 8565.14s]  We need a teleporter
[8565.14s -> 8567.14s]  right here.
[8567.14s -> 8586.21s]  Oh, I'm on fire. What does he say?
[8586.21s -> 8588.90s]  I'm on fire. Fire, fire, fire.
[8588.90s -> 8590.90s]  Fire, fire.
[8590.90s -> 8602.34s]  Oh, fire.
[8622.30s -> 8625.36s]  Medic, medic.
[8625.36s -> 8628.50s]  You can edit that in.
[8628.50s -> 8630.50s]  You have sound effects editing capabilities.
[8630.50s -> 8637.54s]  What's hillbilly?
[8637.54s -> 8650.70s]  Should I sit in a chair? Seeing a tornado.
[8650.70s -> 8652.70s]  Hillbilly seeing a tornado.
[8652.70s -> 8655.89s]  Maybe no gloves.
[8655.89s -> 8662.99s]  With the Mario gloves on.
[8662.99s -> 8664.99s]  Hillbilly seeing a tornado.
[8664.99s -> 8666.99s]  Is this the beard? No, that's the
[8666.99s -> 8683.12s]  hat. Isn't this what Mario just looks like
[8683.12s -> 8686.38s]  without his hat on? If Mario
[8686.38s -> 8688.38s]  doesn't have his hat on, this is what he looks like, alright?
[8688.38s -> 8690.94s]  When Mario's hat comes off in the games,
[8690.94s -> 8696.83s]  he looks like this. No gloves?
[8696.83s -> 8702.51s]  Oh, man.
[8702.51s -> 8706.22s]  What's that? I think that's a tornado.
[8706.22s -> 8708.72s]  Oh, that's a tornado
[8708.72s -> 8711.54s]  right there. That's a tornado.
[8711.54s -> 8713.90s]  We gotta get everybody
[8713.90s -> 8716.27s]  inside. Get everybody.
[8716.27s -> 8718.51s]  Wait a minute.
[8718.51s -> 8720.69s]  I gotta save him. I gotta
[8720.69s -> 8722.69s]  save him from the tornado.
[8722.69s -> 8725.31s]  Come here.
[8725.31s -> 8730.62s]  I got you. There you go.
[8730.62s -> 8735.15s]  You landed in the bed.
[8735.15s -> 8737.15s]  It's getting closer. It's getting closer.
[8737.15s -> 8740.02s]  Oh, we're gonna get
[8740.02s -> 8742.02s]  the cows in or the chickens.
[8742.02s -> 8746.43s]  Get the chickens in. I'm done with
[8746.43s -> 8757.17s]  this one. This one's over.
[8757.17s -> 8759.17s]  None of that is usable.
[8759.17s -> 8767.04s]  So Mario can come off.
[8767.04s -> 8775.41s]  Give me the Mario hat for a second.
[8775.41s -> 8777.41s]  Alright, stuff the hair in here.
[8777.41s -> 8779.97s]  This is important.
[8779.97s -> 8781.97s]  Yeah, but try to get all the hair in here.
[8781.97s -> 8791.18s]  As much of the hair you can get in there
[8791.18s -> 8793.18s]  as possible.
[8793.18s -> 8800.99s]  I gotta nail this, otherwise
[8800.99s -> 8802.99s]  this is the only chance I have to do this.
[8802.99s -> 8806.00s]  Can you do your front? I'll do your back.
[8806.00s -> 8816.99s]  Where's the mustache?
[8816.99s -> 8822.16s]  Thank you.
[8822.16s -> 8825.54s]  I'm gonna give the...
[8825.54s -> 8827.54s]  What? What's wrong?
[8827.54s -> 8829.54s]  Yeah, they are. That's fucking gross.
[8829.54s -> 8835.49s]  You didn't hear any of that.
[8835.49s -> 8838.30s]  Alright, I got one...
[8838.30s -> 8842.34s]  Oh my god, these are gross.
[8842.34s -> 8845.22s]  It's like as if you dunked these in water.
[8845.22s -> 8847.22s]  Alright, I gotta try this once.
[8847.22s -> 8849.22s]  I don't know why I'm so into the drug PSA
[8849.22s -> 8853.89s]  thing.
[8853.89s -> 8855.89s]  Oh!
[8855.89s -> 8859.39s]  Hi kids.
[8859.39s -> 8863.34s]  My name's Sean Stevenson.
[8863.34s -> 8865.34s]  I'm the actor that plays Super Mario on TV.
[8865.34s -> 8868.42s]  But what's not funny and what's not
[8868.42s -> 8872.30s]  bia-hoo is drugs and alcohol.
[8872.30s -> 8874.30s]  If anyone ever tries to press you into
[8874.30s -> 8876.61s]  taking drugs, you just give them a no.
[8876.61s -> 8879.41s]  A no!
[8879.41s -> 8881.65s]  And if you get older
[8881.65s -> 8883.89s]  and you decide to drink when you're 21,
[8883.89s -> 8885.89s]  make sure you do it in moderation.
[8885.89s -> 8888.32s]  Be very careful. Honestly.
[8888.32s -> 8892.34s]  This fucking hair!
[8892.34s -> 8904.10s]  Whatever.
[8904.10s -> 8906.72s]  The actor revealed
[8906.72s -> 8912.67s]  that's not Mario's hair.
[8912.67s -> 8916.70s]  You look like you just got out of jail.
[8916.70s -> 8919.07s]  But honestly though,
[8919.07s -> 8923.74s]  don't do fucking drugs. Don't be an idiot.
[8923.74s -> 8934.61s]  Alright, what's next?
[8934.61s -> 8936.61s]  You're on drugs.
[8936.61s -> 8938.61s]  Marijuana in moderation if you're old enough
[8938.61s -> 8940.61s]  and you can be careful with it.
[8940.61s -> 8942.61s]  Alcohol if you're old enough, be careful with it.
[8942.61s -> 8946.75s]  Understand? Be careful.
[8946.75s -> 8949.44s]  Real PSA. Be careful.
[8949.44s -> 8960.75s]  Don't be dumb. Is it really that bad?
[8960.75s -> 8962.75s]  I should probably have, yeah.
[8962.75s -> 8970.54s]  Let me give you a new shirt.
[8970.54s -> 9222.00s]  Alright, costume change, I'll be right back.
[9222.00s -> 9225.46s]  Almost back. One sec.
[9225.46s -> 9228.08s]  Dude, these little things are insane, by the way.
[9228.08s -> 9231.54s]  These things are awesome. This little guy right here.
[9231.54s -> 9234.10s]  So this is a microphone.
[9234.10s -> 9236.10s]  This is like a little wireless...
[9236.10s -> 9238.66s]  I know, I know.
[9238.66s -> 9242.30s]  This is a microphone.
[9242.30s -> 9244.30s]  You just clip it on and it works.
[9244.30s -> 9246.30s]  I actually really like this.
[9246.30s -> 9251.49s]  Hopefully it's been sounding okay.
[9251.49s -> 9253.49s]  Vincent van Gogh, yeah.
[9253.49s -> 9257.65s]  Probably this one.
[9257.65s -> 9259.65s]  Oh, spoilers, yeah.
[9259.65s -> 9299.70s]  Chat, does that sound fine? Does that sound okay?
[9299.70s -> 9303.39s]  Did we sound good?
[9303.39s -> 9306.91s]  Yeah? It's okay?
[9306.91s -> 9308.91s]  Yeah, I'm telling you, if these things worked out,
[9308.91s -> 9310.91s]  I'm going to shout this fucking company out.
[9310.91s -> 9314.69s]  I swear to God.
[9314.69s -> 9318.38s]  Not yet though. Not yet.
[9318.38s -> 9321.33s]  Not yet.
[9321.33s -> 9323.33s]  This is a painter routine.
[9323.33s -> 9325.33s]  Comment on what I'm painting on the big screen or whatever.
[9325.33s -> 9328.02s]  Yeah, what was the description?
[9328.02s -> 9341.31s]  Okay.
[9341.31s -> 9344.90s]  Take a little bit of this.
[9344.90s -> 9352.45s]  A little bit of this.
[9352.45s -> 9355.01s]  Oh, that looks good, don't you think?
[9355.01s -> 9357.44s]  How do you say it? Looks very good.
[9357.44s -> 9364.29s]  Looking pretty good.
[9364.29s -> 9378.05s]  It's masterpiece.
[9378.05s -> 9380.22s]  No? No?
[9380.22s -> 9384.51s]  It's masterpiece, no?
[9384.51s -> 9387.63s]  No?
[9387.63s -> 9389.63s]  What do you know about art? You know nothing about art.
[9389.63s -> 9391.63s]  You don't know anything.
[9391.63s -> 9395.41s]  You know nothing about art.
[9398.29s -> 9400.29s]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[9400.29s -> 9404.77s]  Add a little bit of this.
[9404.77s -> 9407.58s]  A little bit of green.
[9407.58s -> 9413.46s]  Extra green.
[9413.46s -> 9419.09s]  Just a little final touch.
[9419.09s -> 9421.09s]  What do you think?
[9421.09s -> 9425.95s]  Let me get a little closer.
[9425.95s -> 9431.26s]  Why would I need to get closer?
[9431.26s -> 9433.26s]  That was right here.
[9433.26s -> 9438.18s]  Alright, now let's do a big one.
[9438.18s -> 9440.18s]  Look at what I have for you.
[9440.18s -> 9442.86s]  Look at what I've made for you.
[9442.86s -> 9444.86s]  Oh, it's beautiful, no?
[9444.86s -> 9449.46s]  The colors.
[9449.46s -> 9451.63s]  It looks fantastic.
[9451.63s -> 9456.30s]  One of the best I've ever painted.
[9456.30s -> 9458.30s]  Finishing touches. Add a little bit more red.
[9461.76s -> 9463.76s]  Looks very good.
[9463.76s -> 9465.76s]  Very good.
[9465.76s -> 9470.69s]  I don't like this.
[9470.69s -> 9473.25s]  I don't like this part.
[9473.25s -> 9477.09s]  Right here. Let me change it.
[9477.09s -> 9489.36s]  That's...
[9489.36s -> 9491.36s]  Magnificent. Absolutely
[9491.36s -> 9497.63s]  Magnificent.
[9497.63s -> 9499.63s]  Last final touch, I swear I will not touch it again.
[9499.63s -> 9502.64s]  Oh, beautiful.
[9502.64s -> 9511.28s]  Beautiful painting.
[9511.28s -> 9513.28s]  You don't like my art work?
[9513.28s -> 9517.12s]  But you are stupid. Very stupid.
[9517.12s -> 9520.19s]  She threw this at your face and you turned your fucking head.
[9520.19s -> 9523.26s]  That is a masterpiece right here.
[9523.26s -> 9525.82s]  Fucking dope idiot.
[9525.82s -> 9529.98s]  I got like really into that one.
[9529.98s -> 9532.74s]  I was like into that. That was like fun.
[9532.74s -> 9535.30s]  I was really into that.
[9535.30s -> 9541.44s]  Alright, what else?
[9541.44s -> 9543.44s]  Cashier. Should I?
[9543.44s -> 9546.13s]  Tired, fast food, miserable one.
[9546.13s -> 9548.13s]  A fast food one?
[9548.13s -> 9550.37s]  Should I still be with a mustache
[9550.37s -> 9553.18s]  and a palette?
[9553.18s -> 9559.90s]  This doesn't work for this.
[9559.90s -> 9561.90s]  So I'm working at like a store.
[9561.90s -> 9574.75s]  Same mustache?
[9574.75s -> 9579.10s]  So am I
[9579.10s -> 9584.22s]  scanning items or what am I doing?
[9587.62s -> 9591.70s]  I'm going to be scanning items.
[9591.70s -> 9596.05s]  The fucking Saul Goodman shit is going to be in there.
[9596.05s -> 9604.35s]  How are you?
[9604.35s -> 9608.96s]  I'm doing great.
[9608.96s -> 9615.62s]  This is all you have? This is it?
[9615.62s -> 9617.62s]  Get the cart back there. You're going to have to bring it in.
[9617.62s -> 9624.26s]  Right.
[9624.26s -> 9626.26s]  Look, I don't care.
[9626.26s -> 9628.26s]  I don't care about that.
[9628.26s -> 9630.26s]  Call somebody else.
[9630.26s -> 9632.26s]  I'm literally just here trying to work.
[9632.26s -> 9638.40s]  Why are you telling me this?
[9638.40s -> 9640.58s]  Why are you telling me this?
[9640.58s -> 9642.58s]  I don't want to hear this.
[9642.58s -> 9644.58s]  I'm literally just trying to help you.
[9644.58s -> 9646.58s]  I'm trying to help you. I'm just trying to get you out of here.
[9646.58s -> 9651.57s]  Put up with these fucking people.
[9651.57s -> 9653.57s]  I swear to God. Just screaming at me.
[9653.57s -> 9660.48s]  Okay. Yeah. Sure. Whatever.
[9660.48s -> 9663.60s]  That's it?
[9663.60s -> 9665.60s]  That's $49.
[9665.60s -> 9667.90s]  Thank you.
[9667.90s -> 9675.57s]  Put your card in.
[9675.57s -> 9677.81s]  It goes the other way.
[9677.81s -> 9679.81s]  It goes the other way. The card reader, it goes the other way.
[9679.81s -> 9681.81s]  You have a chip on it, right?
[9681.81s -> 9683.81s]  The chip goes, chip facing in.
[9683.81s -> 9685.81s]  How many stores
[9685.81s -> 9687.81s]  have you been to in your whole life
[9687.81s -> 9689.81s]  that you don't know the chip goes the other way?
[9689.81s -> 9702.66s]  Fast food, what?
[9702.66s -> 9705.34s]  A fast food?
[9705.34s -> 9707.34s]  A barista?
[9707.34s -> 9710.67s]  This is like, oh, do checkout items.
[9710.67s -> 9712.67s]  Okay.
[9712.67s -> 9714.67s]  I can't work with that.
[9714.67s -> 9718.64s]  All right. Barista. Here we go.
[9718.64s -> 9720.88s]  Man, oh, man. Yep.
[9720.88s -> 9722.88s]  Hey, what's up, man? Hey, what's up?
[9722.88s -> 9726.40s]  Yep. I knew you were coming.
[9726.40s -> 9728.40s]  This is yours. That's your extra
[9728.40s -> 9730.40s]  soy latte. Extra whip.
[9730.40s -> 9732.40s]  Extra sugar.
[9732.40s -> 9734.40s]  Yeah, man. Just got a new machine. Hold on.
[9734.40s -> 9738.37s]  Hold on. Let's do that again.
[9738.37s -> 9740.37s]  Oh, yo. What's up? Hey.
[9740.37s -> 9742.54s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I knew you were coming.
[9742.54s -> 9744.54s]  I got you ready. That's your extra whip, extra cream, extra sugar,
[9744.54s -> 9746.54s]  extra not coffee.
[9746.54s -> 9748.54s]  There you go. Take it, man.
[9748.54s -> 9750.54s]  How you been? It's been a hot minute since I've seen you.
[9750.54s -> 9752.54s]  Yeah. You want another coffee?
[9752.54s -> 9754.85s]  Do you want one, too?
[9754.85s -> 9756.85s]  Hey, let me guess. Extra whip,
[9756.85s -> 9758.85s]  extra cream, extra sugar, no coffee.
[9758.85s -> 9760.85s]  Yep. I got you. Don't worry.
[9763.28s -> 9765.28s]  Let's go ahead and put the coffee
[9765.28s -> 9767.28s]  aside over here because we're not going to use it.
[9767.28s -> 9769.28s]  Let's do cream.
[9769.28s -> 9771.28s]  Okay. A bunch of sugar.
[9771.28s -> 9773.28s]  Okay. Interesting.
[9773.28s -> 9775.28s]  Let me go like this
[9775.28s -> 9777.28s]  because it keeps folding in on me.
[9777.28s -> 9779.28s]  Hey, let's try that one more time.
[9779.28s -> 9781.28s]  Oh, yeah. I need those, yeah.
[9785.17s -> 9789.46s]  Hey, here we go.
[9789.46s -> 9792.66s]  All right.
[9792.66s -> 9794.66s]  Looks really nice.
[9794.66s -> 9796.66s]  Hey, hey. What's up, man? How are you?
[9796.66s -> 9798.96s]  Yeah, I got a pot brewing for you right here.
[9798.96s -> 9802.91s]  Was it on?
[9802.91s -> 9804.91s]  Yeah, I think this thing is pushing down.
[9804.91s -> 9810.34s]  Is that better? We good?
[9810.34s -> 9812.83s]  It keeps, like, folding in on itself.
[9812.83s -> 9815.65s]  Hopefully it sounds all right. Good? Okay.
[9815.65s -> 9820.13s]  Hot coffee. Hot pot.
[9820.13s -> 9822.13s]  Let's brew that coffee. Nice, freshly
[9822.13s -> 9824.13s]  brewed coffee. There it is. Throw it away.
[9824.13s -> 9826.43s]  We don't need that. There we go. This is the cream.
[9826.43s -> 9829.12s]  There we go. There's the sugar.
[9829.12s -> 9831.12s]  And there's the milk.
[9831.12s -> 9833.12s]  Hey, what's up, bro? How are you doing?
[9833.12s -> 9835.12s]  I got a coffee for you brewed right before you got in.
[9835.12s -> 9837.12s]  I know your order. Come on.
[9837.12s -> 9839.12s]  I don't know your order or not. There, take it.
[9839.12s -> 9841.68s]  Is it good? Give it a try.
[9841.68s -> 9843.98s]  That's freshly brewed, by the way.
[9843.98s -> 9846.85s]  Yep. Do you want one, too? You want a coffee?
[9846.85s -> 9849.28s]  Hey, let me guess. Cream.
[9849.28s -> 9852.29s]  Sugar. It's syrup.
[9852.29s -> 9854.29s]  And no coffee. You got it. Yep.
[9854.29s -> 9858.06s]  I got you. Is the weather out there?
[9858.06s -> 9860.75s]  Was it hot? Yeah, it's always hot out there.
[9860.75s -> 9863.95s]  Yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[9863.95s -> 9867.34s]  Really? No, dude.
[9867.34s -> 9870.16s]  Really? Hey, try this, man.
[9870.16s -> 9872.16s]  Try this. I call this
[9872.16s -> 9874.16s]  Hey, you know what I call this, man? I call this
[9874.16s -> 9876.34s]  the shit that's after
[9876.34s -> 9878.34s]  you eat the cereal, the milk you drink.
[9878.34s -> 9880.34s]  Here you go. Take it, man. Try it. Give it a try.
[9880.34s -> 9884.16s]  What do you think? Give me your honest opinion.
[9884.16s -> 9887.68s]  I want another real deal. Yeah.
[9887.68s -> 9890.11s]  Mm-hmm. Tasty, isn't it?
[9890.11s -> 9893.50s]  Very good. Yeah, it's very good.
[9893.50s -> 9897.41s]  Wait, what do you want?
[9897.41s -> 9901.70s]  Do you wish you wanted a black coffee?
[9901.70s -> 9905.34s]  What's that? You want a black coffee?
[9905.34s -> 9907.84s]  Fucking weirdo? What?
[9907.84s -> 9911.42s]  What did you say? What did you want?
[9911.42s -> 9913.42s]  I don't know if I even have that. Let me see.
[9913.42s -> 9917.82s]  I've got milk. I've got
[9917.82s -> 9919.82s]  a bunch of cream and I have sugar.
[9919.82s -> 9923.14s]  You want coffee?
[9923.14s -> 9925.14s]  All right, I guess that's fucking weird, but
[9925.14s -> 9927.31s]  I'll make it for you. This is on the ground, by the way.
[9927.31s -> 9934.59s]  All right, there you go. Here's your coffee.
[9934.59s -> 9936.59s]  Freshly brewed. There it is. Put your cup out.
[9936.59s -> 9943.30s]  There it is.
[9943.30s -> 9945.30s]  Weird that somebody ordered a fucking coffee. Usually people order milk,
[9945.30s -> 9947.30s]  sugar, and cream, and then they mix it up and they
[9947.30s -> 9949.30s]  stir it up and they add like fucking hazelnut syrup to it.
[9949.30s -> 9951.73s]  What's going on here? What the fuck is going on?
[9951.73s -> 9953.73s]  That person's a fucking weird person.
[9953.73s -> 9956.80s]  And I want to get him out of my store now.
[9956.80s -> 9958.80s]  Hey, yo, uh, you gotta leave.
[9958.80s -> 9960.80s]  You gotta leave now.
[9960.80s -> 9964.00s]  I'm not into you here. This is fucking
[9964.00s -> 9966.00s]  big, big, big
[9966.00s -> 9968.00s]  dicks coffee. I was going to say this is big
[9968.00s -> 9970.00s]  dicks coffee. You get the fuck out of here.
[9970.00s -> 9975.38s]  Do anyone want some coffee?
[9975.38s -> 9977.81s]  Oh, the
[9977.81s -> 9982.42s]  coffee, really?
[9982.42s -> 9987.79s]  Hey, coffee.
[9987.79s -> 9990.10s]  Coffee. Anyone want some coffee?
[9990.10s -> 9992.10s]  Coffee. I just brewed a fresh pot of coffee.
[9992.10s -> 9994.27s]  Hey, coffee.
[9994.27s -> 9996.27s]  Who wants coffee? Hey, who wants coffee?
[9996.27s -> 9998.27s]  I just, I got a fresh pot of coffee
[9998.27s -> 10000.77s]  here. Hey, who wants coffee?
[10000.77s -> 10003.07s]  You want coffee?
[10003.07s -> 10006.02s]  Hey, you want coffee?
[10006.02s -> 10009.09s]  Hey, who wants coffee?
[10009.09s -> 10011.09s]  I got coffee. I just brewed a fresh pot of coffee.
[10011.09s -> 10013.46s]  Fresh pot. You want coffee?
[10013.46s -> 10015.46s]  I just got a fresh pot of coffee. You want coffee?
[10015.46s -> 10018.64s]  Coffee. Who wants coffee?
[10018.64s -> 10024.02s]  I'm doing it right, right?
[10024.02s -> 10027.09s]  Fast food worker. Oh, God.
[10027.09s -> 10029.97s]  I'm going to say all the fucking fast food workers out there.
[10029.97s -> 10034.77s]  You should be making way more money.
[10034.77s -> 10038.86s]  Dad grilling burgers.
[10038.86s -> 10042.83s]  Well, I probably wouldn't be wearing this.
[10042.83s -> 10049.86s]  I'll do dad grilling burgers.
[10049.86s -> 10054.14s]  It's a beautiful day. Just on grilling duty.
[10054.14s -> 10057.60s]  Be careful over there. Be careful.
[10057.60s -> 10062.13s]  Don't be too rough.
[10062.13s -> 10064.13s]  Let him like a beautiful grill. Beautiful day.
[10064.13s -> 10068.59s]  Yeah. Yep.
[10068.59s -> 10070.77s]  I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
[10070.77s -> 10075.31s]  It's a worst job, by the way.
[10075.31s -> 10079.07s]  I don't know. Nobody can hear me, but still.
[10079.07s -> 10081.07s]  Just sit up here all fucking God damn day.
[10081.07s -> 10084.46s]  Fifteen patties here.
[10084.46s -> 10087.84s]  Four of them are going to get eaten.
[10087.84s -> 10089.84s]  Stupid fucking idiots in this family.
[10089.84s -> 10092.70s]  Yep, I can see you.
[10092.70s -> 10094.70s]  What are you doing?
[10094.70s -> 10097.65s]  That's a funny hat.
[10097.65s -> 10102.13s]  That's a funny hat that you have on.
[10102.13s -> 10104.13s]  Yep, you're my boy.
[10104.13s -> 10107.39s]  Yeah, you are.
[10107.39s -> 10111.87s]  The kid's a fucking idiot.
[10111.87s -> 10125.18s]  Does anybody want a burger? Burgers are almost done.
[10125.18s -> 10127.18s]  I mean, I shouldn't be flipping these as much, but I am.
[10127.18s -> 10131.09s]  What do you do up here besides just flip?
[10131.09s -> 10133.09s]  Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip.
[10133.09s -> 10135.09s]  You just wait for somebody to come tap you on the shoulder.
[10135.09s -> 10140.00s]  Nobody's fucking around me.
[10140.00s -> 10142.00s]  Oh, hey, dad. Oh, there's the grill master.
[10142.00s -> 10144.00s]  There he is, the grill master.
[10144.00s -> 10149.26s]  Yeah, yeah, because nobody else wants to fucking do it.
[10149.26s -> 10151.26s]  So I do it, and I sit here all day.
[10151.26s -> 10153.26s]  You're going to think I want to be back there.
[10153.26s -> 10156.06s]  What's that? No.
[10156.06s -> 10159.71s]  You're doing a great job out there, son.
[10159.71s -> 10161.71s]  Don't climb that.
[10161.71s -> 10163.71s]  Don't get down from there.
[10163.71s -> 10165.71s]  Don't climb that. Do you mind?
[10165.71s -> 10168.66s]  Don't climb that.
[10168.66s -> 10170.66s]  He's a maniac, I know, right?
[10170.66s -> 10173.66s]  He's my son, right?
[10173.66s -> 10177.12s]  You ready for a dog?
[10177.12s -> 10180.00s]  You don't want a dog.
[10180.00s -> 10189.65s]  Does anybody want dogs?
[10189.65s -> 10192.27s]  No one wants a dog.
[10192.27s -> 10197.82s]  What did I put seven on here?
[10197.82s -> 10200.38s]  It's stupid. It's stupid.
[10200.38s -> 10205.36s]  When I take a tally, when I take a tally,
[10205.36s -> 10207.54s]  and I say, what do you want?
[10207.54s -> 10209.54s]  Do you want a burger or do you want a dog?
[10209.54s -> 10211.54s]  And I hear, dog, dog, dog.
[10211.54s -> 10213.54s]  I take a fucking dog.
[10213.54s -> 10216.35s]  What's that? Yeah.
[10216.35s -> 10219.74s]  Yeah, that's awesome.
[10219.74s -> 10222.56s]  You threw them in the pool?
[10222.56s -> 10225.57s]  When I say how many fucking hot dogs I'm going to make,
[10225.57s -> 10227.57s]  it's seven, and nobody eats them.
[10227.57s -> 10229.57s]  Nobody eats the seven dogs.
[10229.57s -> 10238.00s]  You know, I'm going to eat one.
[10238.00s -> 10240.00s]  Those are fucking gross. Those are raw.
[10240.00s -> 10242.62s]  That was pretty much raw.
[10242.62s -> 10246.46s]  That was a raw hot dog that I just ate.
[10246.46s -> 10248.46s]  I wish somebody else could be.
[10248.46s -> 10250.46s]  We should hire someone to do this next time,
[10250.46s -> 10254.98s]  so I don't have to sit here and do this in three hours.
[10254.98s -> 10257.86s]  What's that? Yeah, you want a burger?
[10257.86s -> 10264.50s]  You do? And you want a dog, too?
[10264.50s -> 10266.50s]  Yeah, come on over here.
[10266.50s -> 10268.50s]  I got buns, I got ketchup,
[10268.50s -> 10270.50s]  I've got mustard, there's relish right here, too.
[10270.50s -> 10274.72s]  Please, go for it.
[10274.72s -> 10278.43s]  Whose kid is this?
[10278.43s -> 10280.43s]  He's going to Harvard. I'm telling you.
[10280.43s -> 10282.43s]  Little Michael's going to Harvard.
[10282.43s -> 10285.76s]  He's going to Harvard. I'm telling you.
[10285.76s -> 10289.02s]  He's going to Harvard. Thank you.
[10289.02s -> 10292.80s]  You like it? It's delicious.
[10292.80s -> 10296.90s]  This is what it's about.
[10296.90s -> 10298.90s]  It's about grilling out here with the family,
[10298.90s -> 10300.90s]  with the friends, and yeah, alright.
[10300.90s -> 10303.46s]  Okay.
[10303.46s -> 10305.46s]  How much longer do I do this for?
[10305.46s -> 10312.56s]  Who's going to use this?
[10312.56s -> 10314.56s]  Who's going to use this?
[10314.56s -> 10317.95s]  No one is going to use it.
[10319.95s -> 10322.64s]  I can't just sit up here
[10322.64s -> 10324.64s]  and just fucking do a
[10324.64s -> 10326.64s]  one-man monologue show.
[10326.64s -> 10330.03s]  Do you remember when I did
[10330.03s -> 10332.03s]  the whole saw routine?
[10332.03s -> 10334.03s]  I was in the chair.
[10334.03s -> 10336.03s]  I was five, ten minutes
[10336.03s -> 10338.03s]  straight of doing this whole routine.
[10338.03s -> 10340.03s]  Out of
[10340.03s -> 10342.03s]  four or five hundred videos,
[10342.03s -> 10344.27s]  I think one person
[10344.27s -> 10346.27s]  used it, and it was for five
[10346.27s -> 10348.27s]  seconds total.
[10348.27s -> 10350.27s]  I'm just doing an acting
[10350.27s -> 10352.27s]  study. Who's going to use it
[10352.27s -> 10354.70s]  for anything?
[10354.70s -> 10356.70s]  So this is a driving instructor?
[10356.70s -> 10358.70s]  Okay.
[10358.70s -> 10362.03s]  I need the mustache back on.
[10362.03s -> 10364.03s]  Let me see what it looks like.
[10364.03s -> 10366.03s]  I'm just
[10366.03s -> 10368.03s]  doing it for like ten minutes.
[10368.03s -> 10370.03s]  Nobody stopped me.
[10373.94s -> 10375.94s]  Nobody stopped me.
[10375.94s -> 10377.94s]  I looked at Holly. Holly was just
[10377.94s -> 10379.94s]  sitting there staring at me like,
[10379.94s -> 10381.94s]  she kind of gave me the, are you still going?
[10381.94s -> 10388.46s]  And I'm like, I guess.
[10388.46s -> 10390.77s]  I don't think so.
[10390.77s -> 10394.03s]  Okay.
[10394.03s -> 10399.15s]  So this is a driving instructor.
[10399.15s -> 10403.38s]  I look like a fucking weirdo.
[10403.38s -> 10406.45s]  Okay. Driving instructor.
[10406.45s -> 10408.45s]  Look at the clothes.
[10408.45s -> 10411.20s]  All right.
[10411.20s -> 10413.20s]  So should I be this way?
[10413.20s -> 10415.20s]  If I'm sitting down with a clipboard
[10415.20s -> 10417.50s]  and I'm writing? I don't know.
[10417.50s -> 10419.50s]  Should I be facing
[10419.50s -> 10421.50s]  a few different angles?
[10421.50s -> 10423.50s]  Okay.
[10423.50s -> 10427.98s]  Let me know if I'm in frame
[10427.98s -> 10430.48s]  when I get over there.
[10430.48s -> 10434.18s]  Okay.
[10434.18s -> 10438.85s]  How's this?
[10438.85s -> 10440.85s]  My fly is not down, right?
[10440.85s -> 10447.10s]  I'm not going to get in trouble.
[10447.10s -> 10449.10s]  So like from here up?
[10453.86s -> 10457.89s]  I'm going to hold it here.
[10457.89s -> 10465.18s]  So I'm going to say, if I'm a passenger,
[10465.18s -> 10469.60s]  the driver is over here.
[10469.60s -> 10472.22s]  How are we doing? How are we? Good?
[10472.22s -> 10474.22s]  You can begin at any point.
[10474.22s -> 10476.22s]  I'm going to be paying a lot of attention to what you're doing, by the way.
[10476.22s -> 10481.15s]  You can come out here and take a right.
[10481.15s -> 10487.30s]  Easy on the gas. Easy. Hold it back.
[10487.30s -> 10490.62s]  A little on the gas there.
[10490.62s -> 10493.50s]  You can get on the highway here.
[10493.50s -> 10497.09s]  Stop.
[10497.09s -> 10499.09s]  Slow down.
[10499.09s -> 10504.40s]  I'm going to have to take off a few points for that one.
[10504.40s -> 10507.09s]  But you didn't signal.
[10507.09s -> 10509.09s]  You didn't signal when you went right.
[10509.09s -> 10511.09s]  And that's the first thing that we're going to do here.
[10511.09s -> 10513.09s]  By the way, if you get four or five points wrong here,
[10513.09s -> 10515.09s]  your license is not going to come through.
[10515.09s -> 10518.10s]  And I am a stickler.
[10518.10s -> 10520.10s]  Very much so for these points.
[10520.10s -> 10524.69s]  Just keep that in mind.
[10524.69s -> 10526.69s]  You can merge over here if you want.
[10526.69s -> 10531.74s]  Slowly merge.
[10531.74s -> 10534.30s]  Slowly merge.
[10534.30s -> 10537.12s]  Way too fast.
[10537.12s -> 10539.12s]  Actually too fast.
[10539.12s -> 10542.64s]  Okay. I don't know what that was.
[10542.64s -> 10545.33s]  Just stay in your lane here, please.
[10545.33s -> 10550.64s]  Thank you.
[10550.64s -> 10552.94s]  Very nice.
[10552.94s -> 10557.74s]  That was a good one. That was actually a pretty good merge.
[10557.74s -> 10559.74s]  Good. Watch it.
[10559.74s -> 10561.74s]  Keep your eyes on the road here, please.
[10561.74s -> 10569.68s]  Be careful.
[10569.68s -> 10571.68s]  Do you mind?
[10571.68s -> 10573.68s]  Just go ahead.
[10573.68s -> 10575.68s]  This is my car in the glove box over here with me.
[10575.68s -> 10577.68s]  See if I can grab these glasses.
[10577.68s -> 10580.82s]  Just keep driving.
[10580.82s -> 10582.82s]  You're fine. You're fine. Keep driving.
[10582.82s -> 10586.13s]  Keep driving. You're all right.
[10586.13s -> 10588.13s]  It's a very big car.
[10588.13s -> 10590.13s]  Yeah, that's why I have it.
[10590.13s -> 10597.62s]  Just make sure I can see what you're up to.
[10597.62s -> 10599.62s]  Could you pull this way and park for me, please?
[10599.62s -> 10602.69s]  This is the parallel parking part of the exam.
[10602.69s -> 10605.06s]  Over here,
[10605.06s -> 10607.06s]  parallel parking this spot right here.
[10607.06s -> 10609.06s]  There's two spots available. Not the one in front of the red truck.
[10609.06s -> 10611.49s]  The one behind it.
[10611.49s -> 10613.49s]  Behind the red truck.
[10613.49s -> 10616.11s]  Use your eyes.
[10616.11s -> 10618.42s]  Do you want these?
[10618.42s -> 10622.38s]  Do you want to put these on?
[10622.38s -> 10624.38s]  I told you I was a stickler and I'm going to be that.
[10624.38s -> 10627.01s]  Right there,
[10627.01s -> 10629.01s]  parallel park behind the red truck.
[10629.01s -> 10631.01s]  I'm not going to say it another time.
[10631.01s -> 10635.42s]  Get up there in parallel park.
[10635.42s -> 10637.42s]  You hit it.
[10637.42s -> 10640.37s]  You bumped his bumper.
[10640.37s -> 10642.37s]  Get your tire perpendicular to the window.
[10642.37s -> 10644.37s]  Tire perpendicular to the window.
[10644.37s -> 10646.37s]  Back up at a 40-degree angle.
[10646.37s -> 10648.37s]  Turn around.
[10648.37s -> 10650.37s]  Back up. Drive straight.
[10650.37s -> 10652.37s]  Turn right at 45 degrees. Pull in.
[10652.37s -> 10654.37s]  You learned this already.
[10654.37s -> 10662.43s]  I am very much unhappy.
[10662.43s -> 10664.43s]  That's going to get you two grades off, I think.
[10664.43s -> 10666.80s]  You're not getting your license today, by the way.
[10666.80s -> 10672.24s]  I think that very clear.
[10672.24s -> 10676.08s]  Very bumpy.
[10676.08s -> 10679.71s]  All right, that's enough.
[10679.71s -> 10681.71s]  What I have here is I have
[10681.71s -> 10683.71s]  two bumped cars.
[10683.71s -> 10685.71s]  Would you like to see the notes?
[10685.71s -> 10687.71s]  You can see it if you want. Would you like to see what I've written down?
[10687.71s -> 10689.71s]  Go ahead and look.
[10689.71s -> 10692.51s]  You bumped a car.
[10692.51s -> 10694.51s]  You went 40, 50 miles per hour
[10694.51s -> 10696.51s]  getting on the on-ramp to the highway.
[10696.51s -> 10698.75s]  And not only that, you don't know how to parallel park.
[10698.75s -> 10700.75s]  And guess what? I don't either.
[10700.75s -> 10703.18s]  But I'm not the one getting this test taken.
[10703.18s -> 10706.70s]  Is there anything that you can pass?
[10706.70s -> 10710.54s]  Give me the wheel.
[10710.54s -> 10712.54s]  Let me show you how it's done.
[10712.54s -> 10714.54s]  Here, you hold this. Yeah, you grade me.
[10714.54s -> 10716.78s]  You grade me.
[10716.78s -> 10718.78s]  You go ahead and grade me.
[10718.78s -> 10722.18s]  Easily let off the gas.
[10722.18s -> 10724.42s]  Put the brake on. Let go of the brake very, very easily.
[10724.42s -> 10726.59s]  Easily, easily.
[10726.59s -> 10731.58s]  Thank you.
[10731.58s -> 10734.59s]  Put the gas on. Oh, shit.
[10734.59s -> 10737.47s]  This is how you do it. This is how you drive a goddamn car.
[10737.47s -> 10740.61s]  You can go to sleep if you want.
[10740.61s -> 10746.88s]  I got this.
[10746.88s -> 10748.88s]  Very nice. Pull it in.
[10748.88s -> 10750.88s]  Parallel park it. This is how we parallel park.
[10750.88s -> 10755.47s]  Step on the gas.
[10755.47s -> 10757.90s]  Step on the brake.
[10757.90s -> 10760.91s]  Step on the gas again.
[10760.91s -> 10763.34s]  And we're in the spot.
[10763.34s -> 10765.34s]  What did you do, coach?
[10765.34s -> 10767.34s]  What did you put down for me? Did you give me an A?
[10767.34s -> 10773.68s]  Get out of the car.
[10773.68s -> 10775.68s]  Okay, so now I have to be going
[10775.68s -> 10777.68s]  this way?
[10777.68s -> 10784.45s]  Okay.
[10784.45s -> 10787.78s]  Am I on the right side here?
[10787.78s -> 10793.73s]  That pencil.
[10793.73s -> 10801.09s]  The doctor of God.
[10801.09s -> 10805.12s]  So this is for you guys to do
[10805.12s -> 10807.12s]  cuts if you want to do cuts.
[10807.12s -> 10817.41s]  I'm sure about that.
[10817.41s -> 10823.86s]  Okay.
[10823.86s -> 10825.86s]  What you need to do is you need to relax.
[10825.86s -> 10827.86s]  Put your gist up on that gas.
[10831.82s -> 10834.51s]  You screwed that up.
[10834.51s -> 10836.51s]  What you needed to do there is you had to...
[10836.51s -> 10838.51s]  Not happy about it.
[10838.51s -> 10843.18s]  Very much unhappy about that.
[10843.18s -> 10848.24s]  You're pretty dumb.
[10848.24s -> 10850.24s]  Can I just tell you? You're dumb.
[10850.24s -> 10853.06s]  No human drives a car like this.
[10853.06s -> 10855.06s]  No human.
[10855.06s -> 10857.06s]  You could get a chimpanzee in this car and you'd probably do better than the test than you did.
[10857.06s -> 10859.06s]  In fact, you'd get an armadillo
[10859.06s -> 10861.06s]  to do this test and probably do better than you just did.
[10861.06s -> 10863.06s]  You'd get an ant.
[10863.06s -> 10865.06s]  You'd get me an army of ants
[10865.06s -> 10867.06s]  and get them up to the wheel.
[10867.06s -> 10869.06s]  Four or five thousand ants.
[10869.06s -> 10871.06s]  And I could train them to do a better parallel parking job than you could ever imagine.
[10871.06s -> 10874.13s]  Keep going.
[10874.13s -> 10877.84s]  You don't think I could do that?
[10877.84s -> 10879.84s]  You don't think I could train ants to do that?
[10879.84s -> 10881.84s]  You don't think I'm smart enough to train ants?
[10881.84s -> 10887.34s]  They'd be running circles around you, by the way.
[10887.34s -> 10891.17s]  Oh, what a terrible...
[10891.17s -> 10893.17s]  Stop sign. Stop sign.
[10893.17s -> 10895.17s]  Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.
[10895.17s -> 10897.17s]  Stop sign. Stop sign.
[10897.17s -> 10899.17s]  Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.
[10899.17s -> 10901.17s]  Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.
[10901.17s -> 10905.65s]  Do you see what's in front of us?
[10905.65s -> 10907.89s]  You do, right? What's in front of us?
[10907.89s -> 10909.89s]  Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.
[10909.89s -> 10913.28s]  Stop sign.
[10913.28s -> 10920.13s]  Keep going.
[10920.13s -> 10925.74s]  I think the microphone's fucked up.
[10925.74s -> 10928.05s]  There we go.
[10928.05s -> 10931.82s]  Now what I want you to do is I want you to pull in that McDonald's.
[10931.82s -> 10933.82s]  Very important part of your test.
[10933.82s -> 10937.09s]  Driving through a drive-through is actually very hard.
[10937.09s -> 10939.09s]  It's a very narrow road.
[10939.09s -> 10941.09s]  It's a very narrow part of...
[10941.09s -> 10945.63s]  It's hard to kind of navigate in there.
[10945.63s -> 10948.32s]  Pull in smoothly. Smooth it out.
[10948.32s -> 10951.50s]  Stop.
[10951.50s -> 10955.41s]  Roll your window down. Get out of the way.
[10955.41s -> 10959.06s]  Yeah, I'll take
[10959.06s -> 10962.32s]  two double cheeseburgers.
[10962.32s -> 10965.26s]  Three McChickens.
[10965.26s -> 10970.11s]  Yep.
[10970.11s -> 10972.61s]  Two double cheeseburgers.
[10972.61s -> 10975.23s]  Three McChickens. Yep.
[10975.23s -> 10978.05s]  Can I have no sauce on the McChickens?
[10978.05s -> 10981.70s]  No sauce, please.
[10981.70s -> 10983.70s]  They don't...
[10983.70s -> 10985.70s]  You can't do that here?
[10985.70s -> 10987.70s]  I'm working that down on your exam.
[10987.70s -> 10990.70s]  Took me to a McDonald's without any fucking sauce.
[10990.70s -> 10992.70s]  You can't take it off?
[10992.70s -> 10994.70s]  No, that's okay. That's all right.
[10994.70s -> 10996.70s]  Can you...
[10996.70s -> 11001.76s]  Do you want anything?
[11001.76s -> 11003.76s]  And a small drink. A small...
[11003.76s -> 11006.19s]  One small Coke, please.
[11006.19s -> 11009.26s]  And that's it.
[11009.26s -> 11011.26s]  By the way, they rented my sauce.
[11011.26s -> 11013.26s]  They rented my szechuan sauce.
[11013.26s -> 11019.15s]  That's all going on your record here.
[11019.15s -> 11024.59s]  Yeah, pull around. Thank you.
[11024.59s -> 11026.96s]  Hey, howdy. How are you?
[11026.96s -> 11029.76s]  Yep, I'll take it. Can you put it over here?
[11029.76s -> 11031.76s]  I'm just doing a fucking acting class.
[11035.02s -> 11041.68s]  Every character
[11041.68s -> 11043.68s]  is mean.
[11043.68s -> 11047.97s]  Every character is mean.
[11047.97s -> 11054.03s]  Farming minus
[11054.03s -> 11056.03s]  twos.
[11056.03s -> 11059.62s]  What are you talking about?
[11059.62s -> 11061.62s]  I gotta end this one. I gotta end this bit.
[11061.62s -> 11066.46s]  So I'm gonna get out of the car.
[11066.46s -> 11069.15s]  All right, that's good.
[11069.15s -> 11071.15s]  Not a bad showing.
[11071.15s -> 11076.02s]  Let me get out of the car and take a look at the car.
[11076.02s -> 11078.70s]  Okay, let me see the car.
[11078.70s -> 11082.80s]  Turn around. Turn the car around.
[11082.80s -> 11087.52s]  Back it up. Good job.
[11087.52s -> 11089.82s]  Good job. Pull it back here.
[11089.82s -> 11092.06s]  Right here. Right in front of me.
[11092.06s -> 11094.50s]  Right there. Keep going.
[11094.50s -> 11097.06s]  Stop. Nice stop.
[11097.06s -> 11100.69s]  Nice, commanded stop.
[11100.69s -> 11103.70s]  Okay.
[11103.70s -> 11106.06s]  Well, you got an F.
[11106.06s -> 11108.62s]  And you're not gonna be getting your license.
[11108.62s -> 11111.25s]  But if you want to share some McDonald's,
[11111.25s -> 11113.42s]  I'm your guy. So we go ahead and do that.
[11113.42s -> 11116.11s]  End the scene. No one's gonna use that part.
[11116.11s -> 11125.01s]  Okay, what's next?
[11125.01s -> 11127.01s]  I can't
[11127.01s -> 11129.01s]  get hit by the car.
[11129.01s -> 11131.01s]  God damn it, I keep going this way.
[11131.01s -> 11133.01s]  Why do I keep going
[11133.01s -> 11135.50s]  that way? I just
[11135.50s -> 11137.50s]  keep going the way I can't go.
[11137.50s -> 11146.06s]  Hold on. Let me move this.
[11146.06s -> 11150.86s]  Okay, that's fine.
[11150.86s -> 11152.86s]  Playing musical chairs by yourself.
[11152.86s -> 11154.86s]  Playing musical chairs by yourself.
[11154.86s -> 11158.05s]  This one's fine.
[11158.05s -> 11161.70s]  That's a very quick one.
[11161.70s -> 11163.70s]  Should I put the mustache back on?
[11163.70s -> 11168.88s]  You know
[11168.88s -> 11170.88s]  what it is? It's when I put a mustache on,
[11170.88s -> 11172.88s]  I'm like a mean guy.
[11172.88s -> 11175.18s]  I think this is the excuse to be
[11175.18s -> 11177.18s]  kind of like a dick to everybody.
[11177.18s -> 11179.42s]  I don't know why.
[11179.42s -> 11205.47s]  Musical chairs with one person.
[11205.47s -> 11214.88s]  I got it. I got it.
[11214.88s -> 11216.88s]  I got it. I got it.
[11216.88s -> 11219.25s]  I got it.
[11219.25s -> 11223.01s]  I got it. Thank you.
[11223.01s -> 11229.47s]  Alright, there was musical chairs
[11229.47s -> 11232.42s]  with no one. Doctor?
[11232.42s -> 11234.66s]  Am I in the same office?
[11234.66s -> 11236.66s]  Hey.
[11236.66s -> 11238.66s]  Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something.
[11238.66s -> 11240.66s]  Fuck face. I got a mustache on. I'm pissed.
[11240.66s -> 11245.90s]  This is a weird ASMR
[11245.90s -> 11254.61s]  video. This is an
[11254.61s -> 11258.38s]  ASMR video.
[11258.38s -> 11263.31s]  Okay, this is actually...
[11263.31s -> 11269.65s]  Those latex
[11269.65s -> 11272.40s]  gloves are terrifying.
[11272.40s -> 11274.40s]  I mean, give them to me. Why not? I guess.
[11276.58s -> 11278.58s]  Why would a doctor walk in
[11278.58s -> 11280.88s]  like this?
[11280.88s -> 11282.88s]  Okay, let's go ahead and start your checkup.
[11282.88s -> 11284.88s]  Like every other ASMR
[11284.88s -> 11286.88s]  video. How do you feel? How are you doing?
[11286.88s -> 11289.06s]  Oh my god.
[11289.06s -> 11297.89s]  Hello, patient.
[11297.89s -> 11300.58s]  This is an ASMR. I can't do this.
[11300.58s -> 11306.72s]  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[11306.72s -> 11309.02s]  How are you?
[11309.02s -> 11312.85s]  How are you feeling?
[11312.85s -> 11314.85s]  So it says here you have a little bit of a tummy ache.
[11314.85s -> 11317.47s]  Yeah. When did it start?
[11317.47s -> 11322.14s]  Last weekend. Okay.
[11322.14s -> 11324.51s]  Any bloating? Any gas?
[11324.51s -> 11326.51s]  Any flatulence that I
[11326.51s -> 11331.55s]  need to know? Okay.
[11331.55s -> 11333.55s]  How often are you
[11333.55s -> 11335.55s]  using the bathroom?
[11335.55s -> 11344.58s]  Me, me, me, me.
[11344.58s -> 11347.07s]  I fucking can't do this one.
[11347.07s -> 11349.07s]  I can't do this one. This one's too
[11349.07s -> 11351.07s]  weird. I can't do it.
[11351.07s -> 11353.07s]  This one's
[11353.07s -> 11355.63s]  fucked up.
[11355.63s -> 11357.81s]  I'll at least do this.
[11357.81s -> 11360.43s]  Ow! That hurts so
[11360.43s -> 11363.95s]  bad. Oh my
[11363.95s -> 11365.95s]  brain. Ow, my brain.
[11365.95s -> 11367.95s]  Okay, take
[11367.95s -> 11369.95s]  this. This is a real stethoscope.
[11369.95s -> 11371.95s]  Ow, my fucking head.
[11371.95s -> 11376.35s]  Okay.
[11376.35s -> 11381.22s]  Let me check and see how you're doing.
[11381.22s -> 11383.22s]  Very, very healthy sounding.
[11383.22s -> 11386.85s]  Very healthy.
[11386.85s -> 11388.85s]  Can you follow my
[11388.85s -> 11392.50s]  pen, please?
[11392.50s -> 11394.50s]  Very good, very good. Excellent, excellent.
[11394.50s -> 11401.79s]  Can you
[11401.79s -> 11403.79s]  stick both my fingers up your nose?
[11403.79s -> 11407.95s]  You said you had a runny nose?
[11407.95s -> 11414.61s]  I think you might have the cold.
[11414.61s -> 11418.64s]  Anything else bothering you today?
[11418.64s -> 11424.83s]  Okay.
[11424.83s -> 11430.78s]  A little fast.
[11430.78s -> 11433.15s]  Well, it's not the common cold.
[11433.15s -> 11435.15s]  I unfortunately have to diagnose you with
[11435.15s -> 11437.39s]  cringe. That's what you're suffering
[11437.39s -> 11444.37s]  from. Get a prescription for
[11444.37s -> 11447.50s]  it. The prescription is
[11447.50s -> 11449.50s]  at least four to six hours
[11449.50s -> 11451.50s]  of call of duty
[11451.50s -> 11453.74s]  every day. Make sure that
[11453.74s -> 11455.74s]  you're not as cringy as you are.
[11455.74s -> 11458.37s]  Take some of that cringe off.
[11458.37s -> 11460.37s]  And by the way, that is for Xbox 360.
[11460.37s -> 11465.36s]  No other console.
[11465.36s -> 11468.56s]  Not on PlayStation.
[11468.56s -> 11470.56s]  You can just take this whole thing.
[11470.56s -> 11472.56s]  Go ahead. Take the whole thing.
[11472.56s -> 11478.13s]  Ow, my fucking ears.
[11478.13s -> 11482.02s]  Somebody said what?
[11482.02s -> 11484.02s]  That I'm a slut?
[11484.02s -> 11486.02s]  Wait, I didn't hear you.
[11486.02s -> 11489.79s]  Somebody called you
[11489.79s -> 11491.79s]  a slut.
[11491.79s -> 11498.70s]  What?
[11498.70s -> 11500.70s]  All right, who's next? What's next?
[11500.70s -> 11502.70s]  Sleazy selling what?
[11502.70s -> 11505.71s]  There's that over there, too,
[11505.71s -> 11518.62s]  if you want to wear it.
[11518.62s -> 11520.62s]  It's kind of funny, actually, if somebody
[11520.62s -> 11523.06s]  used the doctor's stuff for
[11523.06s -> 11525.06s]  he's listening to his own penis.
[11525.06s -> 11527.06s]  Wait, like, is that
[11527.06s -> 11529.06s]  because
[11529.06s -> 11531.23s]  I feel like
[11531.23s -> 11533.23s]  there's going to be some combinations.
[11533.23s -> 11535.23s]  The best part about doing this stuff is
[11535.23s -> 11537.23s]  people are going, you know, people are saying,
[11537.23s -> 11539.23s]  dude, what the hell are we going to use this for, right?
[11539.23s -> 11541.23s]  But the creativity of the community
[11541.23s -> 11543.23s]  is just, it blows me away.
[11543.23s -> 11545.23s]  Because last time we said the same shit
[11545.23s -> 11547.23s]  and you guys combined
[11547.23s -> 11549.23s]  a bunch of things and made it into
[11549.23s -> 11551.23s]  the same video.
[11551.23s -> 11553.23s]  So I'm very excited to see what the hell you guys
[11553.23s -> 11555.23s]  can come up with, especially with the weird shit
[11555.23s -> 11560.54s]  that's happening today.
[11560.54s -> 11562.54s]  Okay.
[11562.54s -> 11564.54s]  All right, so walking around with a briefcase.
[11564.54s -> 11568.13s]  I think this is a fine outfit.
[11568.13s -> 11574.85s]  Oh, smash it.
[11574.85s -> 11589.76s]  Yeah.
[11589.76s -> 11592.26s]  Hold on, let me get rid of this chair.
[11604.21s -> 11606.21s]  There's a whole Spiderman costume
[11606.21s -> 11609.07s]  here now. All right.
[11609.07s -> 11611.50s]  We're doing sleazy like
[11611.50s -> 11622.58s]  stockbroker. Yeah.
[11622.58s -> 11624.58s]  No, no, no, no, no. I ain't going to be
[11624.58s -> 11626.75s]  doing that. You're going to sell that one.
[11626.75s -> 11629.31s]  Sell it. Yeah.
[11629.31s -> 11631.31s]  Who is going to buy that? Are you serious?
[11631.31s -> 11634.70s]  No, that company's going
[11634.70s -> 11636.70s]  under. There's no way they're going to have, no.
[11636.70s -> 11638.70s]  Their earnings are probably terrible. Sell it.
[11638.70s -> 11643.31s]  No, I think, honestly,
[11643.31s -> 11645.31s]  look, I'm going to work. I'm
[11645.31s -> 11647.31s]  on the way to work right now.
[11647.31s -> 11650.38s]  We can talk this later.
[11650.38s -> 11653.07s]  But I want you to buy
[11653.07s -> 11655.07s]  any company that makes,
[11655.07s -> 11657.57s]  makes, what the hell
[11657.57s -> 11659.57s]  are they called? I don't know. The kids, I'll
[11659.57s -> 11661.57s]  watch it. TikTok. Can you buy
[11661.57s -> 11664.58s]  TikTok? How do you buy that?
[11664.58s -> 11668.74s]  My son's into it. Big time. Yeah.
[11668.74s -> 11670.74s]  I mean, I think, I don't know how to buy it.
[11670.74s -> 11672.74s]  Is it possible? Not really?
[11672.74s -> 11676.90s]  All right.
[11676.90s -> 11678.90s]  Find me a company that is just
[11678.90s -> 11680.90s]  like TikTok then and buy that one then.
[11680.90s -> 11685.04s]  Go fuck yourself.
[11685.04s -> 11688.75s]  Why would somebody do that?
[11688.75s -> 11690.75s]  Wait, hold on.
[11690.75s -> 11692.75s]  There's a message. Hold on. Wait.
[11692.75s -> 11694.75s]  There's a special message from Mr.
[11694.75s -> 11697.06s]  Giraffe. I've got
[11697.06s -> 11702.22s]  to answer it. Hello?
[11702.22s -> 11704.22s]  Mr. Giraffe. Oh my goodness.
[11704.22s -> 11706.72s]  I'm so glad to hear from you. Did you
[11706.72s -> 11709.02s]  find that company? Yeah. Yeah. No, no.
[11709.02s -> 11711.02s]  I didn't mean to hang up on you that hard.
[11711.02s -> 11713.02s]  I didn't mean to hang up on one of your employees.
[11713.02s -> 11715.39s]  No, of course not.
[11715.39s -> 11717.39s]  Mr. Giraffe, I don't want
[11717.39s -> 11719.39s]  to buy Google stock.
[11719.39s -> 11721.39s]  I want to buy the TikTok company.
[11721.39s -> 11724.85s]  Okay.
[11724.85s -> 11726.85s]  All right. All right. Fine. Fine. Fine.
[11726.85s -> 11728.85s]  This is way too big for a briefcase.
[11728.85s -> 11730.85s]  This is a fucking
[11730.85s -> 11732.85s]  huge briefcase.
[11732.85s -> 11734.85s]  Who would have this?
[11734.85s -> 11736.85s]  This is fucking ridiculous.
[11738.85s -> 11740.85s]  Look at how huge this is.
[11740.85s -> 11742.85s]  What is even in this?
[11745.34s -> 11747.34s]  What is in this thing?
[11749.34s -> 11760.03s]  Well, I got mad. There it is.
[11760.03s -> 11762.03s]  All right. Let's do the mime stuff.
[11762.03s -> 11764.59s]  All right. We're going to do another costume change.
[11764.59s -> 11767.28s]  Do Saul Goodman?
[11767.28s -> 11770.10s]  I don't even know what to do.
[11770.10s -> 11772.10s]  What do you mean Saul Goodman?
[11772.10s -> 11775.47s]  He's Cinnabon.
[11775.47s -> 11782.32s]  Didn't I already do that?
[11782.32s -> 11785.90s]  Saul Goodman.
[11785.90s -> 11789.09s]  What's the line?
[11789.09s -> 11791.09s]  Guys, I haven't seen past season two
[11791.09s -> 11793.33s]  of Saul Goodman.
[11793.33s -> 11803.50s]  Just say Saul Goodman.
[11803.50s -> 11807.73s]  What is it?
[11807.73s -> 11810.22s]  In the...I'm in a Cinnabon
[11810.22s -> 11812.85s]  outfit.
[11812.85s -> 11814.85s]  I haven't seen past season two of Saul Goodman.
[11814.85s -> 11820.08s]  I don't know.
[11820.08s -> 11822.08s]  Hi. I'm Saul Goodman.
[11822.08s -> 11824.08s]  And do you know that you have rights?
[11824.08s -> 11826.45s]  Call me.
[11826.45s -> 11831.04s]  What is it again?
[11831.04s -> 11835.01s]  Oh, yeah. What is it?
[11835.01s -> 11837.01s]  Hi. I'm Saul Goodman. Do you know that you have
[11837.01s -> 11839.01s]  rights? The Constitution says you do.
[11839.01s -> 11841.01s]  And so do I. I've lived until proven guilty.
[11841.01s -> 11843.01s]  Every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent.
[11843.01s -> 11845.01s]  And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque.
[11845.01s -> 11847.01s]  You better call Saul. Saul Goodman.
[11847.01s -> 11849.50s]  This is like a long thing.
[11849.50s -> 11856.29s]  Hi. I'm Saul Goodman.
[11856.29s -> 11858.29s]  And let me tell you something about Saul Goodman.
[11858.29s -> 11860.29s]  Did you know that you have rights?
[11860.29s -> 11862.29s]  And so do I, Albuquerque.
[11862.29s -> 11864.29s]  I'm here to fight for you
[11864.29s -> 11866.29s]  and to fight for your rights and fight for you
[11866.29s -> 11868.29s]  in a court of law. Give me a call.
[11868.29s -> 11870.29s]  Better call Saul.
[11870.29s -> 11873.10s]  Better call Saul Goodman.
[11873.10s -> 11875.10s]  Close enough. Print it. I'm not doing another take.
[11875.10s -> 11877.10s]  I'm an actor. And I'm a good one.
[11877.10s -> 11879.10s]  A good actor can take a script
[11879.10s -> 11881.10s]  and can change it and make it sound better
[11881.10s -> 11883.10s]  in front of the camera.
[11883.10s -> 11885.66s]  I'm an actor. Are you an actor?
[11885.66s -> 11889.30s]  Can you do this?
[11889.30s -> 11891.30s]  No, you can't. You can't do that.
[11891.30s -> 11893.73s]  Prove it to me if you could.
[11893.73s -> 11897.12s]  I'm an actor. Can you do this?
[11897.12s -> 11904.98s]  I'm an actor.
[11904.98s -> 11924.94s]  I act for a living.
[11924.94s -> 11926.94s]  You're embarrassing yourself.
[11926.94s -> 11933.01s]  Welcome to the last 12 years of my life.
[11933.01s -> 11935.50s]  Alright, what's next? Chef?
[11935.50s -> 11937.50s]  I feel like dad grilling burgers and chef
[11937.50s -> 11939.50s]  are going to be pretty similar.
[11939.50s -> 11958.82s]  Alright, how's that?
[11958.82s -> 11961.06s]  I need like a thing to
[11961.06s -> 11963.06s]  sit this on, like a table or something, right?
[11963.06s -> 11965.36s]  Or would I just be holding it in the air?
[11965.36s -> 11967.36s]  We could move one of those over.
[11967.36s -> 11969.66s]  What do you think? That could be like a
[11969.66s -> 11971.66s]  burner. I wonder if you could
[11971.66s -> 11981.07s]  clip that out.
[11981.07s -> 11998.91s]  Should I be back a little more?
[11998.91s -> 12013.94s]  I need two chops.
[12013.94s -> 12022.77s]  I need two chops. Two chops.
[12022.77s -> 12025.14s]  I need a little more.
[12025.14s -> 12027.14s]  Pass me the salt please.
[12027.14s -> 12036.45s]  Thank you.
[12036.45s -> 12040.10s]  Two chops coming up. Two chops.
[12040.10s -> 12042.53s]  Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[12042.53s -> 12047.62s]  Behind. Behind.
[12047.62s -> 12055.10s]  Behind. Behind.
[12055.10s -> 12058.61s]  Yes, chef. Yep.
[12058.61s -> 12061.49s]  I'm looking for the pork chop. Yep.
[12061.49s -> 12063.73s]  Behind. Behind.
[12063.73s -> 12069.42s]  Can I use your burner?
[12069.42s -> 12071.92s]  Can I use your burner?
[12071.92s -> 12074.74s]  I need to use your burner. I need to use your burner.
[12074.74s -> 12082.10s]  Thank you. No, it's not there. It's not there.
[12082.10s -> 12090.99s]  You didn't say behind.
[12090.99s -> 12092.99s]  Say it when you go buy somebody.
[12092.99s -> 12095.30s]  You just bumped me. I don't even know how much I put in.
[12101.38s -> 12119.28s]  All right. How much time? Very good. Very good.
[12119.28s -> 12121.28s]  So far so good. Yes, chef.
[12121.28s -> 12123.90s]  Yeah, I'm currently trying to make
[12123.90s -> 12125.90s]  sure that I have enough of the
[12125.90s -> 12127.90s]  seasoning on here. I'm also trying to make
[12127.90s -> 12130.08s]  sure that I have two. I'm looking for the
[12130.08s -> 12135.26s]  wontons. Where are the wontons?
[12135.26s -> 12137.89s]  Where are the wontons?
[12137.89s -> 12141.47s]  Chef, where are the
[12141.47s -> 12143.47s]  wontons? You closed the fridge
[12143.47s -> 12145.47s]  at the beginning of the tournament. Where are the
[12145.47s -> 12147.47s]  wontons? I need them for my wonton soup
[12147.47s -> 12149.47s]  thing that I'm doing. Where are the
[12149.47s -> 12155.49s]  wontons? Can I have? Okay.
[12155.49s -> 12160.48s]  You got kicked out of chef school.
[12160.48s -> 12163.68s]  I didn't. They got kicked out of chef school.
[12163.68s -> 12166.37s]  I didn't. Fuck them.
[12166.37s -> 12169.18s]  I know I can't say swears on TV. I know. I'm sorry.
[12169.18s -> 12171.18s]  I can't. I know I'm not supposed to say swears.
[12171.18s -> 12188.27s]  Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. I got it. I got it.
[12188.27s -> 12194.74s]  I got it. I got it. I got it. Yeah.
[12194.74s -> 12196.74s]  My risotto is going to be in the oven in just about
[12196.74s -> 12199.68s]  five minutes, chef.
[12199.68s -> 12201.68s]  I've got a creamy cheddar risotto and I
[12201.68s -> 12203.68s]  also have a creamy broccoli risotto
[12203.68s -> 12205.68s]  and I also have a creamy mushroom
[12205.68s -> 12207.98s]  risotto. And then
[12207.98s -> 12215.15s]  pork chops. Yes. I only
[12215.15s -> 12217.15s]  know how to make risotto besides that. I don't know.
[12217.15s -> 12221.68s]  This is done. All right.
[12221.68s -> 12225.71s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Time.
[12225.71s -> 12243.87s]  Okay. Yep. Hi chefs.
[12243.87s -> 12245.87s]  What I made for you today is I have
[12245.87s -> 12247.87s]  a creamy mushroom risotto
[12247.87s -> 12249.87s]  and a side of creamy broccoli risotto
[12249.87s -> 12251.87s]  with a hint, a small
[12251.87s -> 12253.87s]  portion of a creamy chicken
[12253.87s -> 12255.87s]  risotto. And then on the side
[12255.87s -> 12257.87s]  of that I also have two pork chops
[12257.87s -> 12259.87s]  that I have created and I seared to perfection
[12259.87s -> 12261.87s]  and then finished off in the oven.
[12261.87s -> 12271.46s]  Yes, chef.
[12271.46s -> 12277.54s]  Yeah. Well, I mean,
[12277.54s -> 12280.16s]  ever since I was on my own, I
[12280.16s -> 12282.91s]  you know, started to cook
[12282.91s -> 12284.91s]  for myself ever since I was on my own.
[12284.91s -> 12290.80s]  And I learned how to make
[12290.80s -> 12292.80s]  mushroom risotto and yeah.
[12292.80s -> 12298.75s]  And that's what my mom
[12298.75s -> 12301.31s]  taught me, you know.
[12301.31s -> 12303.31s]  I call her every Sunday.
[12303.31s -> 12307.78s]  Yes, chef. Yes,
[12307.78s -> 12318.08s]  chef. Yeah. I understand.
[12318.08s -> 12323.07s]  It's not good.
[12323.07s -> 12325.95s]  What do you mean it's not good?
[12325.95s -> 12327.95s]  It's a perfect risotto.
[12327.95s -> 12330.90s]  It's perfect.
[12330.90s -> 12336.21s]  It's a perfect risotto.
[12336.21s -> 12338.21s]  You like to talk like you know food, but you actually
[12338.21s -> 12340.21s]  really don't. You're just a mean
[12340.21s -> 12342.21s]  guy that got a bunch of TV shows.
[12342.21s -> 12344.21s]  You're just a mean guy that got a bunch
[12344.21s -> 12346.21s]  of TV shows and I'm not
[12346.21s -> 12348.21s]  going to stand for it. I'm not leaving.
[12348.21s -> 12350.21s]  No, I think I deserve to win.
[12350.21s -> 12364.80s]  It was a creamy mushroom risotto and you
[12364.80s -> 12366.80s]  don't have a fucking palate to save your
[12366.80s -> 12368.80s]  life, you fucking idiot.
[12378.69s -> 12380.69s]  It's so good.
[12380.69s -> 12382.69s]  It's so good. Whatever.
[12382.69s -> 12384.69s]  I don't care.
[12384.69s -> 12401.97s]  What do we do with this?
[12401.97s -> 12405.55s]  Okay.
[12405.55s -> 12407.55s]  One of me winning. Okay.
[12407.55s -> 12413.70s]  Yes, chef.
[12413.70s -> 12418.56s]  What I have for you there is I have two seared pork chops
[12418.56s -> 12420.56s]  with a side of creamy cranberry sauce.
[12420.56s -> 12422.56s]  And I know that you're
[12422.56s -> 12424.56s]  a big fan of chocolate, so
[12424.56s -> 12426.56s]  I added some chocolate flakes on top.
[12426.56s -> 12443.10s]  Yes.
[12443.10s -> 12445.10s]  I had a limited amount of time, so
[12445.10s -> 12447.10s]  I want to make sure that I got the pork chops out
[12447.10s -> 12449.10s]  when the shavings went on to the risotto.
[12449.10s -> 12455.04s]  And the cranberry.
[12455.04s -> 12457.04s]  Yes. Yes.
[12457.04s -> 12459.04s]  Yes. Yes.
[12459.04s -> 12461.60s]  You've got it. You've got it. You've got it.
[12461.60s -> 12463.84s]  Yes. I did it.
[12463.84s -> 12466.46s]  I did it. Yes.
[12466.46s -> 12468.46s]  Thank you. Thank you so much, chef.
[12468.46s -> 12470.46s]  Seriously.
[12470.46s -> 12472.46s]  Thank you so much, chef.
[12472.46s -> 12474.46s]  When I get to the next round, you better believe
[12474.46s -> 12476.46s]  I'm going to cook my ass off.
[12476.46s -> 12478.46s]  Yeah. Thank you, chef.
[12478.46s -> 12480.46s]  Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[12480.46s -> 12483.34s]  I'm the fucking man.
[12483.34s -> 12486.42s]  What do you got? Nothing?
[12486.42s -> 12490.64s]  That's me. I won.
[12490.64s -> 12492.64s]  I'm going to the next round.
[12495.71s -> 12497.71s]  Something about that I didn't like.
[12497.71s -> 12500.21s]  Hold on a minute. Yes, chef.
[12500.21s -> 12503.09s]  Yes, chef.
[12503.09s -> 12505.09s]  I actually just had it before you did.
[12505.09s -> 12507.09s]  I just had some before you did.
[12507.09s -> 12510.40s]  I may have undercooked it.
[12514.58s -> 12518.42s]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[12518.42s -> 12520.42s]  I think yours might be done
[12520.42s -> 12525.54s]  more than mine.
[12525.54s -> 12527.54s]  Mine was a little underdone.
[12527.54s -> 12542.82s]  Yours will be okay, though. Yes, chef.
[12542.82s -> 12547.62s]  Cowboy?
[12547.62s -> 12549.62s]  You should act as the chef.
[12549.62s -> 12551.79s]  The critiquing chef?
[12551.79s -> 12553.79s]  I don't even know how.
[12553.79s -> 12559.23s]  Fight a chef in the outfit.
[12559.23s -> 12562.43s]  Do the Wellington bit.
[12562.43s -> 12564.43s]  I don't have the outfit.
[12564.43s -> 12575.36s]  Ugh. Dodge an axe.
[12575.36s -> 12582.00s]  Let me see.
[12582.00s -> 12589.68s]  Please do the stop it thing.
[12589.68s -> 12595.06s]  We got time.
[12595.06s -> 12597.06s]  Don't do the Wellington thing.
[12597.06s -> 12604.03s]  I'm not doing the Wellington thing.
[12604.03s -> 12606.03s]  What do we got for the next costume?
[12617.20s -> 12619.20s]  I'm trying to stay in the same
[12619.20s -> 12621.20s]  clothing for a lot of them in a row
[12621.20s -> 12623.20s]  because obviously it's easier
[12623.20s -> 12625.20s]  to cut into.
[12625.20s -> 12627.20s]  There were so many requests
[12627.20s -> 12629.20s]  and so many different costumes that
[12629.20s -> 12633.62s]  I've seen so often.
[12633.62s -> 12654.98s]  Move this. So you want to draw?
[12654.98s -> 12660.14s]  You tell me when. Draw.
[12660.14s -> 12662.14s]  I must have lost.
[12662.14s -> 12682.93s]  Should have been more careful.
[12682.93s -> 12729.63s]  I've got one from this side.
[12729.63s -> 12744.46s]  I've got my eye on you. Be careful.
[12744.46s -> 12750.27s]  I've got one from up here. Let me tell you.
[12750.27s -> 12755.58s]  You be on your best behavior.
[12755.58s -> 12758.53s]  Why don't you give me a wink when you're ready to go?
[12758.53s -> 12769.39s]  Now!
[12769.39s -> 12778.29s]  I just shot myself.
[12778.29s -> 12780.29s]  Oh, panty for gold?
[12780.29s -> 12782.72s]  In this pan?
[12782.72s -> 12785.15s]  Fuck up this pan.
[12785.15s -> 12788.48s]  Should I wear the chef's hat for that too?
[12788.48s -> 12790.48s]  I've got like gold chunks.
[12790.48s -> 12803.86s]  Yes, chef. Oh, behind.
[12803.86s -> 12813.44s]  We'll get a new pan. Yes, chef.
[12813.44s -> 12815.44s]  Yeah, I'm currently cooking a
[12815.44s -> 12817.94s]  gold nugget.
[12817.94s -> 12819.94s]  You're probably wondering where the mustache came from and where the hat came from.
[12819.94s -> 12822.56s]  I change my
[12822.56s -> 12835.98s]  outfits sometimes.
[12835.98s -> 12838.99s]  Hear that sizzle?
[12838.99s -> 12851.79s]  That's a sizzle right there.
[12851.79s -> 12857.28s]  Why does the chef have a gun?
[12857.28s -> 12859.28s]  Okay, nod occasionally and go
[12859.28s -> 12861.28s]  Yeah, yep, yeah, yep.
[12861.28s -> 12864.93s]  Okay, well I want to do the
[12864.93s -> 12866.93s]  yeah, yep one.
[12866.93s -> 12881.87s]  Yeah. Yep.
[12881.87s -> 12885.26s]  Yes, sir. Yep.
[12885.26s -> 12891.07s]  Yeah. Yep.
[12891.07s -> 12897.26s]  Yep. Yeah.
[12897.26s -> 12903.07s]  Yep. Yeah.
[12903.07s -> 12907.15s]  Very interesting.
[12907.15s -> 12910.10s]  Very interesting.
[12910.10s -> 12915.07s]  Yep. That's right.
[12915.07s -> 12921.65s]  Yes. Drink out of this thing.
[12926.51s -> 12937.97s]  I don't care.
[12937.97s -> 12949.66s]  It's full of flavor.
[12949.66s -> 12961.62s]  Yep.
[12961.62s -> 12968.34s]  What's this one?
[12968.34s -> 12970.51s]  Get out. Get away.
[12970.51s -> 12981.38s]  Get. Crash.
[12981.38s -> 12988.10s]  Get out. Get again. Get out.
[12988.10s -> 12990.40s]  Yeehaw.
[12990.40s -> 12992.90s]  Oh, you. You over there.
[12992.90s -> 12994.90s]  Throat.
[12994.90s -> 13009.09s]  Anybody else have something to say?
[13009.09s -> 13027.52s]  Didn't think so.
[13027.52s -> 13038.26s]  You missed one. Table.
[13038.26s -> 13041.20s]  Oh, okay. Write silent
[13041.20s -> 13047.41s]  in a notebook.
[13047.41s -> 13049.41s]  I'm taking the hat off of this.
[13049.41s -> 13062.53s]  This is the mustache guy.
[13062.53s -> 13064.77s]  I love how the notebook is Bugleberry's cauldron
[13064.77s -> 13069.89s]  book. Okay, so just write silently
[13069.89s -> 13076.61s]  in a notebook.
[13076.61s -> 13192.38s]  Read it. Pretend not to understand
[13192.38s -> 13196.54s]  and throw it. What is wrong with this guy?
[13196.54s -> 13199.87s]  This mustache shirt
[13199.87s -> 13201.87s]  guy has been doing a lot of
[13201.87s -> 13215.95s]  fucking weird shit.
[13215.95s -> 13223.06s]  That can't be right. This can't be
[13223.06s -> 13235.01s]  right. No, no, no, no.
[13235.01s -> 13240.13s]  I don't understand.
[13240.13s -> 13256.70s]  I'll do one more violent.
[13256.70s -> 13259.33s]  No, what is what?
[13259.33s -> 13263.94s]  I don't get it.
[13263.94s -> 13278.26s]  I don't get it.
[13278.26s -> 13280.26s]  Any more for the guy with the mustache?
[13280.26s -> 13285.70s]  Is somebody going to do 23?
[13285.70s -> 13291.14s]  He's reading
[13291.14s -> 13297.66s]  the Bible.
[13297.66s -> 13303.10s]  Eat plastic toys
[13303.10s -> 13306.62s]  at a table?
[13310.21s -> 13312.21s]  I kind of did that one already. Hacking into the main
[13312.21s -> 13314.21s]  frame.
[13314.21s -> 13316.51s]  Oh, I did the keyboard already.
[13316.51s -> 13319.95s]  Oh, with the
[13319.95s -> 13325.01s]  keyboard, yeah.
[13325.01s -> 13327.01s]  Slowly stroke the mustache. I can do that.
[13327.01s -> 13329.01s]  Not that way.
[13329.01s -> 13373.94s]  Slams hands.
[13373.94s -> 13377.39s]  Tick-tock
[13377.39s -> 13379.39s]  dances.
[13379.39s -> 13382.85s]  What are these tick-tock dances?
[13382.85s -> 13384.85s]  It's like do tick-tock dances.
[13384.85s -> 13393.68s]  What are they? I don't know
[13393.68s -> 13398.86s]  any tick-tock dances, really.
[13398.86s -> 13400.86s]  I definitely want to get into Spider-Man soon
[13400.86s -> 13412.13s]  because I think that's fucking hilarious.
[13412.13s -> 13414.13s]  No, what is this?
[13414.13s -> 13416.69s]  The power of God
[13416.69s -> 13418.69s]  and anime on my side.
[13418.69s -> 13422.66s]  I mean, should I
[13422.66s -> 13425.47s]  just do it in this?
[13425.47s -> 13427.47s]  Yeah, I took the jeans off because
[13427.47s -> 13429.47s]  it's like 110 degrees.
[13429.47s -> 13431.71s]  I had that gray shirt
[13431.71s -> 13433.71s]  for continuity and the jeans
[13433.71s -> 13435.71s]  and I was like, I always wanted to puke. It was so hot.
[13435.71s -> 13438.72s]  Alright, so I have the power
[13438.72s -> 13440.72s]  of God and anime?
[13440.72s -> 13448.38s]  So you want me to just do that?
[13448.38s -> 13451.39s]  Like this?
[13451.39s -> 13455.94s]  A weapon?
[13455.94s -> 13458.24s]  So I dance around and move around and I go, I have the power
[13458.24s -> 13460.24s]  of God and anime on my side.
[13460.24s -> 13463.70s]  Who is this for?
[13463.70s -> 13470.42s]  I have the power of God
[13470.42s -> 13472.42s]  and anime on my side.
[13472.42s -> 13482.13s]  Scream?
[13482.13s -> 13484.13s]  I have the power of God and anime on my side.
[13484.13s -> 13494.05s]  Is that good enough?
[13494.05s -> 13546.13s]  I still have to do the accordion.
[13546.13s -> 13556.82s]  The mime outfit?
[13556.82s -> 13559.44s]  I'm just going to stay.
[13559.44s -> 13561.44s]  I'm just going to stay in this.
[13561.44s -> 13563.74s]  In the boat?
[13563.74s -> 13572.32s]  I feel like I should stay as the same guy
[13572.32s -> 13586.27s]  for a while. I learned this one.
[13586.27s -> 13593.55s]  All of you.
[13593.55s -> 13595.55s]  This water is so
[13595.55s -> 13600.99s]  dirty.
[13600.99s -> 13602.99s]  I learned this one when I was traveling
[13602.99s -> 13609.63s]  abroad, right?
[13623.46s -> 13640.14s]  Please clap.
[13648.40s -> 13657.36s]  Don't splash me.
[13657.36s -> 13659.36s]  Don't splash me. Throw him out. He splashed me
[13659.36s -> 13661.36s]  with water. Don't splash
[13661.36s -> 13663.36s]  me. Splashing. You can't splash here.
[13663.36s -> 13665.36s]  It says it on the sign before we walked in.
[13665.36s -> 13667.36s]  Don't splash people.
[13667.36s -> 13669.36s]  Don't splash.
[13669.36s -> 13671.36s]  Fucking idiot.
[13671.36s -> 13674.94s]  Don't splash you.
[13674.94s -> 13682.37s]  Throw him out. Throw him out.
[13682.37s -> 13695.04s]  Toss me there.
[13695.04s -> 13698.11s]  I'm getting away from him.
[13698.11s -> 13700.11s]  Those of you that want to hear another song,
[13700.11s -> 13702.11s]  follow me please.
[13702.11s -> 13707.36s]  This one's called
[13707.36s -> 13715.92s]  The Train Tracks.
[13715.92s -> 13718.29s]  No. This one's called
[13718.29s -> 13722.06s]  The Mandalorian Theme Song.
[13722.06s -> 13724.82s]  Give me that
[13724.82s -> 13726.82s]  pigeon.
[13726.82s -> 13761.95s]  This is a goddamn
[13761.95s -> 13771.81s]  children's toy.
[13771.81s -> 13788.83s]  What'd I get?
[13788.83s -> 13792.16s]  Oh.
[13792.16s -> 13798.56s]  That's a big one.
[13798.56s -> 13805.26s]  It's getting tangled.
[13805.26s -> 13812.05s]  I'll get one more out there. There we go.
[13812.05s -> 13814.05s]  There we go. That's a bite.
[13814.05s -> 13816.42s]  There it is. There we go.
[13816.42s -> 13827.49s]  That's
[13827.49s -> 13829.49s]  a big one right here. That's a huge one.
[13829.49s -> 13835.06s]  I'll take a picture of that.
[13835.06s -> 13837.42s]  Whoever's got a camera. You got one?
[13837.42s -> 13841.07s]  Take a picture of this one.
[13841.07s -> 13843.07s]  Cheese. I gave you the finger.
[13843.07s -> 13845.07s]  You can't use that anywhere now.
[13845.07s -> 13848.34s]  Can't put that on fucking Facebook or anything.
[13848.34s -> 13850.34s]  I'm here on vacation.
[13850.34s -> 13858.34s]  Shut up.
[13858.34s -> 13862.56s]  What's next?
[13862.56s -> 13864.56s]  Any more mean guy with the mustache?
[13864.56s -> 13876.40s]  You should walk on water.
[13876.40s -> 13884.91s]  Apology?
[13884.91s -> 13886.91s]  Oh, like an apology video.
[13886.91s -> 13889.28s]  Should I do an apology video
[13889.28s -> 13891.28s]  as the guy with the mustache on?
[13891.28s -> 13895.38s]  For all the things he's been doing?
[13895.38s -> 13897.38s]  Oh, in case I don't see you.
[13897.38s -> 13911.25s]  That's
[13911.25s -> 13913.25s]  some of my shit I've been doing.
[13913.25s -> 13918.82s]  The guy with the mustache
[13918.82s -> 13920.82s]  is just heinous.
[13920.82s -> 13922.82s]  And has to make a YouTube apology video for all
[13922.82s -> 13924.82s]  this stupid shit he's been...
[13924.82s -> 13942.98s]  Good afternoon. My name is...
[13942.98s -> 13946.30s]  My name was not in Borden, actually.
[13946.30s -> 13952.05s]  Good afternoon.
[13952.05s -> 13955.25s]  I just want to make this video really quickly
[13955.25s -> 13958.19s]  to say
[13958.19s -> 13960.43s]  I'm sorry for
[13960.43s -> 13962.43s]  the way that I've been acting while I was on vacation.
[13962.43s -> 13965.06s]  There's been various videos
[13965.06s -> 13967.06s]  around that have been surfacing out about my
[13967.06s -> 13969.06s]  time traveling.
[13969.06s -> 13971.23s]  And I just want to say
[13971.23s -> 13973.60s]  from the bottom of my heart, very sorry
[13973.60s -> 13975.60s]  for the way I've been acting.
[13975.60s -> 13977.60s]  Very sorry for the dumb things that I've been saying.
[13977.60s -> 13979.90s]  And a lot of people
[13979.90s -> 13981.90s]  have coined me the
[13981.90s -> 13983.90s]  mean mustache guy.
[13983.90s -> 13985.90s]  Mean mustache guy.
[13985.90s -> 13988.90s]  I gotta say, that hurts.
[13988.90s -> 13991.20s]  I don't think that's very fair.
[13991.20s -> 13993.20s]  I think everything I said was
[13993.20s -> 13995.20s]  I was very angry at certain things
[13995.20s -> 13997.20s]  and certain people has splashed a few people, but whatever.
[13997.20s -> 13999.20s]  I don't want to be that.
[13999.20s -> 14001.20s]  I'm not the angry mustache guy.
[14001.20s -> 14003.63s]  My name is
[14003.63s -> 14005.63s]  Sean.
[14005.63s -> 14008.32s]  That's what you can call me now.
[14008.32s -> 14010.32s]  Not angry mustache guy
[14010.32s -> 14012.32s]  that you see on YouTube.
[14012.32s -> 14016.53s]  Sean.
[14016.53s -> 14018.53s]  Anyways, I'm sorry for all
[14018.53s -> 14020.53s]  the things that I've been saying. The things I did.
[14020.53s -> 14022.90s]  Hopefully I can
[14022.90s -> 14025.84s]  get back to normal now.
[14025.84s -> 14027.84s]  I really just hope so.
[14027.84s -> 14030.14s]  I've been very, very
[14030.14s -> 14032.14s]  the last five or six days have been
[14032.14s -> 14034.45s]  a little interesting.
[14034.45s -> 14036.45s]  So I'm sorry.
[14036.45s -> 14038.45s]  What else do you want me to say? Do you want any more than that?
[14038.45s -> 14040.45s]  I'm very sorry.
[14040.45s -> 14042.45s]  I'm incredibly sorry. Do you want more than that?
[14042.45s -> 14046.61s]  That's all I'm going to give you.
[14046.61s -> 14049.66s]  But I do apologize.
[14049.66s -> 14051.66s]  So good night. Have a great rest of your evening.
[14051.66s -> 14054.03s]  And keep
[14054.03s -> 14056.53s]  keep going.
[14056.53s -> 14058.90s]  Whatever you're doing.
[14058.90s -> 14060.90s]  I'm going to go back to being a good person.
[14060.90s -> 14063.33s]  You just wait. Good person Sean
[14063.33s -> 14065.33s]  is what you'll call me. Not this.
[14065.33s -> 14067.33s]  I'm shaving this. Good person Sean
[14067.33s -> 14074.67s]  is coming up. It's me.
[14074.67s -> 14076.67s]  And the funny thing is immediately after that you could show
[14076.67s -> 14078.67s]  another TikTok UI video of me
[14078.67s -> 14083.60s]  being terrible.
[14083.60s -> 14089.62s]  Shaved Sean.
[14089.62s -> 14091.62s]  Shaved Sean.
[14091.62s -> 14093.62s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[14093.62s -> 14095.62s]  I'm shaved now.
[14095.62s -> 14102.98s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14102.98s -> 14105.54s]  That's what I hear. Shut up.
[14105.54s -> 14109.12s]  Shut up. Yeah.
[14109.12s -> 14111.74s]  Shut the fuck up.
[14111.74s -> 14113.74s]  Stupid. You're all stupid idiots.
[14113.74s -> 14117.25s]  You're dumb.
[14117.25s -> 14121.20s]  You're the dumbest one here.
[14121.20s -> 14123.20s]  Turn that off.
[14123.20s -> 14125.20s]  Turn that off. I'm shaved Sean.
[14125.20s -> 14127.20s]  I'm a different person now. Turn that camera up.
[14127.20s -> 14135.95s]  Hold on a minute.
[14135.95s -> 14137.95s]  Back up. Everybody back up. I'll prove it.
[14137.95s -> 14167.07s]  I'll prove to you that I'm a good person.
[14167.07s -> 14171.30s]  What's your name? I feel great.
[14171.30s -> 14174.11s]  Ever since it was...
[14174.11s -> 14176.48s]  I feel like a completely different person.
[14176.48s -> 14178.48s]  Your name? Dave?
[14178.48s -> 14180.48s]  I'm Sean. Shaved Sean.
[14180.48s -> 14183.55s]  From now on. Do you need help?
[14183.55s -> 14185.55s]  I could help you guys with anything you need.
[14185.55s -> 14187.55s]  I could help you move that furniture.
[14187.55s -> 14189.73s]  Shaved Sean here.
[14189.73s -> 14192.10s]  That's right. Yeah.
[14192.10s -> 14204.38s]  Much love to everybody here.
[14204.38s -> 14206.38s]  I was going to do a routine where I shaved my balls.
[14206.38s -> 14215.98s]  Never mind.
[14215.98s -> 14217.98s]  Fuck. Have we been doing this before?
[14217.98s -> 14219.98s]  Have we been doing this for four hours?
[14219.98s -> 14225.09s]  What? What the fuck?
[14225.09s -> 14227.71s]  I think we should end on this maybe.
[14227.71s -> 14233.41s]  Yeah. Let me get into that right now.
[14233.41s -> 14235.41s]  Yeah. We're going to do another costume change.
[14235.41s -> 14240.40s]  This is an important costume change.
[14240.40s -> 14242.40s]  I feel like this is going to be somebody's...
[14242.40s -> 14245.86s]  some of you guys' favorite of the night.
[14245.86s -> 14267.04s]  Another change. I'll be right back.
[14267.04s -> 14269.04s]  I can do this one real quick. Somebody said please do the Truman Show thing.
[14269.04s -> 14271.04s]  Alright.
[14271.04s -> 14283.71s]  I need the briefcase.
[14283.71s -> 14288.06s]  Howdy. Hey.
[14288.06s -> 14290.06s]  In case I don't see you. Good afternoon, good evening, and good night.
[14290.06s -> 14299.14s]  There you go.
[14299.14s -> 14309.25s]  You forgot good morning?
[14309.25s -> 14311.25s]  Oh, whatever.
[14311.25s -> 14326.02s]  This one...
[14326.02s -> 14328.02s]  Let me just show you what I'm changing.
[14328.02s -> 14330.02s]  Everyone that's like, oh, that must be the end.
[14330.02s -> 14334.80s]  No, it's not.
[14334.80s -> 14489.55s]  We got a lot to do with this guy.
[14489.55s -> 14521.22s]  Can anybody hear me?
[14521.22s -> 14534.91s]  How do I work this fucking thing?
[14534.91s -> 14553.14s]  Put it all again, Steve.
[14553.14s -> 14555.44s]  This is not my fucking video.
[14555.44s -> 14557.44s]  It's not like college dorm room.
[14557.44s -> 14564.99s]  It's just...
[14564.99s -> 14566.99s]  It's just that college dorm room video.
[14566.99s -> 14595.52s]  I want to...
[14595.52s -> 14597.52s]  Okay.
[14597.52s -> 14599.70s]  It's going to be that college video every time.
[14599.70s -> 14602.19s]  Whatever. Why would I have a tricycle this small?
[14602.19s -> 14605.07s]  Why wouldn't I get one for adults?
[14605.07s -> 14607.57s]  Get one for adults.
[14607.57s -> 14610.24s]  Not ones for children.
[14610.24s -> 14622.21s]  Adults can't ride these.
[14622.21s -> 14627.55s]  Hello again, Peter. It's me, Saul.
[14627.55s -> 14629.55s]  You're probably wondering why you're here.
[14629.55s -> 14632.11s]  What you're doing, locked up down here.
[14632.11s -> 14636.90s]  Well, I'll tell you.
[14636.90s -> 14638.90s]  Six weeks ago, you had
[14638.90s -> 14640.90s]  over 40 pornhub tabs open at the same time.
[14640.90s -> 14643.46s]  And you crashed your computer.
[14643.46s -> 14646.46s]  So now you have
[14646.46s -> 14648.46s]  40 computers with
[14648.46s -> 14651.41s]  40 different porn videos on them.
[14651.41s -> 14653.41s]  40 separate pornography videos.
[14653.41s -> 14656.03s]  You need to go and
[14656.03s -> 14659.62s]  close them all before the knock on the door
[14659.62s -> 14663.44s]  of your mother finds you.
[14663.44s -> 14666.06s]  You have one minute. Make your choice.
[14666.06s -> 14684.35s]  Oh, by the way, Peter,
[14684.35s -> 14686.35s]  forgot to mention. I know you only have 45
[14686.35s -> 14689.10s]  seconds left. The room
[14689.10s -> 14693.50s]  is about to fill with gas.
[14693.50s -> 14696.51s]  Nerve gas. Oh, I know
[14696.51s -> 14698.51s]  nerve gas very well. I said
[14698.51s -> 14700.51s]  nerve gas in SAW 1 through
[14700.51s -> 14702.51s]  5 over 200
[14702.51s -> 14706.53s]  times. You don't think I know?
[14706.53s -> 14708.53s]  It's a deadly nerve agent
[14708.53s -> 14710.53s]  and it will poison your
[14710.53s -> 14714.50s]  blood. Make your choice. You have 10
[14714.50s -> 14718.53s]  seconds. As the poison courses
[14718.53s -> 14721.66s]  through your veins, as the gas
[14721.66s -> 14724.80s]  fills your lungs.
[14724.80s -> 14726.80s]  Will you be able to succeed?
[14726.80s -> 14733.38s]  Oh, you did it. You did it.
[14733.38s -> 14736.06s]  Hey, Pete did it.
[14736.06s -> 14739.70s]  You actually did it.
[14739.70s -> 14742.51s]  Steve, what's your name again? I forget.
[14742.51s -> 14745.14s]  Good job. Go through the door.
[14745.14s -> 14747.82s]  Go out the door. You did it. Nice
[14747.82s -> 14754.16s]  job. You actually did it. Outside
[14754.16s -> 14756.91s]  of that door is another 50 computers
[14756.91s -> 14760.11s]  with 50 pornhub tabs open.
[14760.11s -> 14765.09s]  You must.
[14765.09s -> 14767.09s]  The hair is getting into my eyes.
[14767.09s -> 14777.95s]  No, I don't want them to know my identity.
[14777.95s -> 14784.35s]  Inside of this room, 10 bear traps on the ground.
[14784.35s -> 14787.68s]  You have three minutes to find
[14787.68s -> 14790.30s]  the key. Unlock the bear trap
[14790.30s -> 14793.63s]  that's around your head. Traps
[14793.63s -> 14795.94s]  everywhere. So when you step around, you have to be
[14795.94s -> 14797.94s]  very careful that you won't step in a bear trap.
[14797.94s -> 14801.07s]  You step in one of those, your leg will be
[14801.07s -> 14803.07s]  severed at the knee, John.
[14803.07s -> 14808.30s]  Also, the room is going to fill with gas.
[14808.30s -> 14811.55s]  At the same time, tons of
[14811.55s -> 14816.42s]  gas will fill the room. Gas!
[14816.42s -> 14828.82s]  And you'll die. Make your choice.
[14828.82s -> 14834.77s]  I'm not going to twerk his jigsaw, I'm kidding.
[14834.77s -> 14838.42s]  Any requests? Is the bowtie fucked up?
[14838.42s -> 14844.53s]  Oh, is it? A drug?
[14844.53s -> 14847.28s]  No!
[14847.28s -> 14849.28s]  No, dude!
[14849.28s -> 14858.74s]  Yeah, you want to fix it?
[14858.74s -> 14860.74s]  A drug? The drug?
[14860.74s -> 14871.17s]  A drug PSA? Oh my
[14871.17s -> 14889.33s]  god. Alright. Hello again.
[14889.33s -> 14892.66s]  It is I, Jigsaw, here to tell
[14892.66s -> 14895.98s]  you that you have a choice to me.
[14895.98s -> 14904.80s]  And it's time for you to me. We're talking about drugs.
[14904.80s -> 14908.88s]  How you should not do them. We all have a choice.
[14908.88s -> 14910.88s]  Hi, everybody. I'm the actor that plays Jigsaw.
[14910.88s -> 14913.55s]  Jeremy Albertson. I just want to make
[14913.55s -> 14915.55s]  sure that everyone's aware that if you
[14915.55s -> 14918.05s]  are approached with somebody offering
[14918.05s -> 14920.93s]  a drug or an alcohol, you can
[14920.93s -> 14924.56s]  refuse. There's no reason to do it.
[14924.56s -> 14926.74s]  So, if we could all have
[14926.74s -> 14929.55s]  our own Jigsaw's
[14929.55s -> 14932.54s]  puzzles to complete in our heads
[14932.54s -> 14935.74s]  to Western Pennsylvania
[14935.74s -> 14937.74s]  as the most patriotic.
[14937.74s -> 14939.98s]  I'm just like finding words.
[14939.98s -> 14946.82s]  I'm just
[14946.82s -> 14957.57s]  kind of like stuck. Hello again,
[14957.57s -> 14961.09s]  Internet. No. Hello again,
[14961.09s -> 14964.80s]  John. What you see before you
[14964.80s -> 14968.00s]  is a choice. A very important
[14968.00s -> 14971.84s]  choice. One that will live with you forever.
[14971.84s -> 14975.60s]  But you can make it. You might be able
[14975.60s -> 14979.12s]  to save yourself. I'm of course talking about
[14979.12s -> 14982.45s]  drugs and alcohol. Hi, everyone. My name
[14982.45s -> 14984.88s]  is Sean Albertson. I play the character
[14984.88s -> 14986.88s]  Jigsaw on the daytime TV
[14986.88s -> 14988.88s]  show. Jigsaw is coming
[14988.88s -> 14991.44s]  for you. I wanted to make sure I did
[14991.44s -> 14993.44s]  this quick little PSA that
[14993.44s -> 14995.68s]  we all have a choice
[14995.68s -> 14997.92s]  to make. And that's drugs and alcohol.
[14997.92s -> 15001.36s]  No reason to do them. Drugs are something
[15001.36s -> 15003.66s]  if you ever approached and pressured, make
[15003.66s -> 15006.72s]  your choice and say no. No to
[15006.72s -> 15018.03s]  drugs. Thank you. Now let's get back
[15018.03s -> 15025.31s]  to the show. There's a key
[15025.31s -> 15028.06s]  inside of your eyeball. You need to
[15028.06s -> 15030.06s]  dig it out with your bare hands and then eat it.
[15030.06s -> 15032.50s]  And then shit it out. When you shit it out,
[15032.50s -> 15034.50s]  then only then can you use the key
[15034.50s -> 15036.50s]  to unlock the bear trap that's around John's neck.
[15054.62s -> 15061.19s]  Wait, wait, wait. How did he get in here?
[15061.19s -> 15063.56s]  How did he get in here? How did he get in here?
[15063.56s -> 15065.93s]  You're not supposed to be able to get in here.
[15065.93s -> 15068.92s]  Ow. Ouch. No.
[15068.92s -> 15070.92s]  No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
[15070.92s -> 15073.10s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. You didn't make your
[15073.10s -> 15075.40s]  choice. Your choice is if he killed me.
[15075.40s -> 15091.30s]  Hi, everyone. My name is Sean Elberton.
[15091.30s -> 15094.36s]  I'm the actor, writer, director, producer,
[15094.36s -> 15096.36s]  and main talent of the daytime
[15096.36s -> 15098.60s]  television show Jigsaw is Here.
[15098.60s -> 15101.86s]  And I just have something very
[15101.86s -> 15103.86s]  important that we all have to do. We have to make choices.
[15103.86s -> 15106.42s]  And one choice is for you to watch this show
[15106.42s -> 15109.61s]  because the ratings have been very poor
[15109.61s -> 15112.74s]  and I believe that we are
[15112.74s -> 15114.74s]  below reruns of infomercials at this point.
[15114.74s -> 15117.37s]  So I figured we could give you a
[15117.37s -> 15119.37s]  quick little, like maybe you could watch the show if you want.
[15119.37s -> 15121.61s]  For the
[15121.61s -> 15123.61s]  six to seven hundred of you that do watch
[15123.61s -> 15126.41s]  the show, thank you so much.
[15126.41s -> 15128.41s]  It means a lot. The cast and crew,
[15128.41s -> 15131.03s]  we obviously put a lot of time into this show.
[15131.03s -> 15133.03s]  So we'll get back to it though. Let's get back to your regularly scheduled
[15133.03s -> 15135.40s]  programming of Jigsaw's Coming for You,
[15135.40s -> 15137.40s]  written and directed, starring, and produced by
[15137.40s -> 15140.86s]  me, Sean Elberton.
[15140.86s -> 15150.57s]  What is it?
[15150.57s -> 15152.57s]  He isn't pretending.
[15152.57s -> 15154.81s]  He's playing a
[15154.81s -> 15159.10s]  kid actor.
[15159.10s -> 15161.10s]  Do a family guy rag doll as
[15161.10s -> 15163.10s]  Jigsaw. Oh my god.
[15163.10s -> 15166.42s]  It's okay.
[15166.42s -> 15168.42s]  I'm going to be dead on the ground anyways.
[15168.42s -> 15170.42s]  Oh, yeah, they're having a hard time hearing you. Oh, it flipped.
[15170.42s -> 15172.79s]  That's why. Oh, it flipped. Can you mute it?
[15172.79s -> 15174.79s]  Oh, it should be. You know what? The batteries are dying.
[15174.79s -> 15177.42s]  Should we go with the other one?
[15177.42s -> 15182.34s]  I think I got another minute. I still want to do
[15182.34s -> 15184.84s]  Spider-Man. This is like too much
[15184.84s -> 15188.42s]  fun. Okay, here's the problem.
[15188.42s -> 15190.42s]  Like, I always come to these things
[15190.42s -> 15193.43s]  with so much shit.
[15193.43s -> 15195.99s]  And I just, like,
[15195.99s -> 15198.55s]  I have so many more things here.
[15198.55s -> 15205.83s]  Don't make it the last one.
[15205.83s -> 15209.29s]  It's
[15209.29s -> 15211.78s]  too fun. All right, we're going to do some speed runs.
[15211.78s -> 15216.26s]  We'll do speed runs. All right, all right, all right.
[15216.26s -> 15218.26s]  Here's the deal. I'm going to do
[15218.26s -> 15223.00s]  I'm going to get out of Jigsaw.
[15223.00s -> 15227.35s]  I can't believe I did that college video.
[15227.35s -> 15229.35s]  Okay, let me get into Spider-Man and we'll do some Spider-Man
[15229.35s -> 15236.44s]  stuff because I need
[15236.44s -> 15238.87s]  to be, we've got to be out of here in
[15238.87s -> 15242.26s]  two or three hours.
[15242.26s -> 15244.26s]  It's going to take about an hour or two to pack up.
[15244.26s -> 15246.50s]  So really only have like another 45
[15246.50s -> 15248.81s]  minutes to an hour. So let me
[15248.81s -> 15251.11s]  try to speed run some stuff.
[15251.11s -> 15255.78s]  We'll put on Spider-Man. I'll be right back.
[15255.78s -> 15316.33s]  Let's do this real quick.
[15316.33s -> 15326.94s]  Uh-uh. No strings.
[15326.94s -> 15331.22s]  Ta-da.
[15331.22s -> 15339.08s]  Hey. Where'd he go?
[15339.08s -> 15341.08s]  Where's the bunny?
[15341.08s -> 15347.34s]  Where'd the bunny go? I don't know.
[15347.34s -> 15350.47s]  Where's that rabbit? Uh-oh.
[15350.47s -> 15352.47s]  Jigsaw's
[15352.47s -> 15355.54s]  tricycle. You know what's really funny
[15355.54s -> 15357.54s]  about that though? We built that.
[15357.54s -> 15359.54s]  We put the tricycle together and I actually rode
[15359.54s -> 15361.54s]  it around my living room
[15361.54s -> 15363.54s]  for like 10 seconds and it was fine.
[15363.54s -> 15365.54s]  So of course it like blows up here.
[15365.54s -> 15367.54s]  You were, you rode it too and it was fine.
[15367.54s -> 15370.68s]  I think I put way too much
[15370.68s -> 15372.68s]  weight on it because I couldn't see.
[15372.68s -> 15388.30s]  Yeah, put that on a birthday card. I don't care.
[15388.30s -> 15390.30s]  Do, use it whatever you want.
[15390.30s -> 15396.38s]  Oh, let me see that.
[15396.38s -> 15428.49s]  What? How did I tie it in a knot?
[15428.49s -> 15431.88s]  I don't know. I tied it in a knot somehow.
[15431.88s -> 15433.88s]  What is going on?
[15433.88s -> 15440.02s]  How does this work?
[15440.02s -> 15448.71s]  Oh, I get it. Alright. I get it.
[15448.71s -> 15452.55s]  I get it. I get it. Okay.
[15452.55s -> 15466.63s]  I get it. It keeps bunching up.
[15466.63s -> 15469.13s]  It's bunching up. I don't know what to do.
[15469.13s -> 15471.94s]  Is this thing still on?
[15471.94s -> 15477.37s]  Can you hear me? How am I doing this wrong?
[15477.37s -> 15480.82s]  I don't understand how I'm doing this wrong.
[15480.82s -> 15488.57s]  I'm doing it wrong apparently. Is this a regular deck of cards?
[15488.57s -> 15501.35s]  Alright, what do you got?
[15501.35s -> 15503.59s]  There you go. Pick a card.
[15503.59s -> 15505.59s]  Pick a card. Any card. I don't want to see.
[15505.59s -> 15509.85s]  Pick a card. Pick a card.
[15509.85s -> 15512.86s]  This one? That one right there?
[15512.86s -> 15514.86s]  Pick that one. Gonna stick it back in the deck
[15514.86s -> 15517.16s]  right here. Check that out. Cut it.
[15517.16s -> 15522.50s]  Cut it again. Cut it again. Cut it again.
[15522.50s -> 15529.02s]  Cut it again. Cut it again.
[15529.02s -> 15533.05s]  What was it again? What was that card?
[15533.05s -> 15536.10s]  That one. Right there, wasn't it?
[15536.10s -> 15539.74s]  Bingo. Wanna pick another one?
[15539.74s -> 15542.10s]  Pick another card. Take another one. Which one do you want?
[15542.10s -> 15544.10s]  Anyone. Anyone. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[15544.10s -> 15546.10s]  Which one? Which one? This one right here? That one?
[15546.10s -> 15548.28s]  That one? This is your card? That's your card right there?
[15548.28s -> 15550.65s]  Let's get that back in the deck.
[15550.65s -> 15553.27s]  Tuck it in there. There it is.
[15553.27s -> 15556.66s]  Cut. Cut the deck. Cut the deck. Hold on now.
[15556.66s -> 15558.90s]  I'm working on it. Cut the deck again.
[15558.90s -> 15562.86s]  Cut the deck again. Spin that around.
[15562.86s -> 15565.93s]  Cut the deck again. Okay.
[15565.93s -> 15567.93s]  And guess what? I'll put it behind my gosh darn head.
[15567.93s -> 15571.06s]  See? I don't know.
[15571.06s -> 15574.01s]  I don't know where it is. I have no idea.
[15574.01s -> 15579.18s]  Not a clue. Not a clue.
[15579.18s -> 15584.92s]  Is that the card right there?
[15584.92s -> 15586.92s]  Oh.
[15586.92s -> 15590.38s]  It's a joker.
[15590.38s -> 15595.59s]  Bingo. Here's your card. Thank you.
[15595.59s -> 15597.96s]  You're right. Absolutely.
[15597.96s -> 15609.22s]  Let's do this now. Ready? Check this out.
[15609.22s -> 15618.89s]  Is that your card? Oh yeah, it makes it.
[15618.89s -> 15626.63s]  That's funny. Let's make the
[15626.63s -> 15632.71s]  chair disappear. Oh, I didn't even do any
[15632.71s -> 15634.71s]  lightsaber stuff. There's so much
[15634.71s -> 15636.71s]  lightsaber stuff from the other couple of times.
[15636.71s -> 15650.73s]  You guys can figure out what to do.
[15650.73s -> 15683.54s]  Watch. Watch. Watch.
[15683.54s -> 15729.34s]  It's gone.
[15729.34s -> 15733.29s]  Thank you. Thank you.
[15733.29s -> 15739.43s]  Thank you. A rose.
[15739.43s -> 15749.10s]  Oh, I missed. What do I do with this?
[15749.10s -> 15757.59s]  I don't get it. What is this? What do you do with this?
[15757.59s -> 15767.50s]  You light it on fire?
[15767.50s -> 15769.50s]  This one's called, this next one's called sit down.
[15769.50s -> 15772.17s]  Sit down and stop talking during the show.
[15772.17s -> 15775.43s]  This next trick is called
[15775.43s -> 15796.28s]  fire rose.
[15796.28s -> 15803.18s]  Thank you. Thank you very much.
[15803.18s -> 15807.53s]  Don't be alarmed. Don't be alarmed.
[15807.53s -> 15819.22s]  Don't get out of your seat. Thank you.
[15819.22s -> 15824.20s]  Thank you. Yeah.
[15824.20s -> 15826.20s]  Hey, what about this one? You want to see some real magic?
[15826.20s -> 15831.64s]  Boom. What's that in my hand? Look at that.
[15831.64s -> 15841.85s]  Catch it. There it is. It's really heavy.
[15841.85s -> 15844.66s]  Who in the audience can hold it? Golden
[15844.66s -> 15851.30s]  Sphere. There.
[15851.30s -> 15865.90s]  Who wants to see a dove? You ain't going to find magic like that
[15865.90s -> 15875.88s]  anywhere else. Sparks.
[15875.88s -> 15883.30s]  Who wants this?
[15883.30s -> 15886.31s]  Somebody wants the hello my baby,
[15886.31s -> 15888.31s]  hello my honey, hello my ragtime
[15888.31s -> 15894.01s]  gal? You mean like the
[15894.01s -> 15896.01s]  hello my baby, hello my honey.
[15896.01s -> 15904.57s]  I can't kick that high. I'm going to
[15904.57s -> 15916.60s]  rip my pants. My pants are going to rip
[15916.60s -> 15918.97s]  in half. This is actually a nice suit.
[15918.97s -> 15925.18s]  Hello my baby, hello.
[15925.18s -> 15928.18s]  No, I'm not going to do it. I can't do it.
[15928.18s -> 15932.15s]  One more time. Can I
[15932.15s -> 15934.90s]  dub over it? I'm going to dub.
[15934.90s -> 15937.72s]  Here you go. Here's the dub. Just take this audio
[15937.72s -> 15941.37s]  and you can use it. Hello my baby,
[15941.37s -> 15943.37s]  hello my honey, hello my ragtime
[15943.37s -> 15945.37s]  gal. Send me a kiss
[15945.37s -> 15947.37s]  my wife. Baby, my
[15947.37s -> 15949.37s]  heart's on fire. And if you refuse
[15949.37s -> 15951.37s]  me, baby, you'll lose me. And you'll be left
[15951.37s -> 15953.37s]  alone. And tell me, tell me
[15953.37s -> 15955.37s]  that I'm your man.
[15957.37s -> 15994.15s]  Okay, there you go. Just dub it.
[15994.15s -> 15998.89s]  He's going to tear his groin. Where's Spider-Man?
[15998.89s -> 16000.89s]  I know, I know. Spider-Man's coming.
[16000.89s -> 16006.38s]  Let me get this off. Alright, actual
[16006.38s -> 16012.71s]  clothing change. I'll be right back.
[16012.71s -> 16067.30s]  What do you want? Patrick Bateman?
[16067.30s -> 16069.48s]  Like, dressed like this?
[16069.48s -> 16077.80s]  Every single day I put on a
[16077.80s -> 16083.88s]  mask with apricots,
[16083.88s -> 16090.01s]  negros, shell stocks,
[16090.01s -> 16092.57s]  and bonds.
[16092.57s -> 16094.57s]  And I chase people who change their
[16094.57s -> 16096.57s]  lives.
[16096.57s -> 16098.57s]  Your microphone's over here.
[16100.57s -> 16102.94s]  Oops.
[16102.94s -> 16104.94s]  Sorry.
[16104.94s -> 16106.94s]  Oh well, just use that one. Who cares?
[16106.94s -> 16316.71s]  Alright, changing.
[16316.71s -> 16318.71s]  Alright, guys, we've got a problem.
[16318.71s -> 16321.78s]  We've got
[16321.78s -> 16324.34s]  a problem. Big problem.
[16324.34s -> 16326.90s]  I don't, I think
[16326.90s -> 16328.90s]  this costume,
[16328.90s -> 16332.74s]  I think it's two left hands.
[16332.74s -> 16335.50s]  Like, can you, hold on.
[16335.50s -> 16340.66s]  Am I crazy?
[16340.66s -> 16344.31s]  Right? I'm like, I'm crazy
[16344.31s -> 16346.87s]  or not, right?
[16346.87s -> 16352.57s]  This is too, my thumb, I can't
[16352.57s -> 16355.58s]  put the thumb over there. What the fuck?
[16355.58s -> 16361.21s]  Hold on, can I like,
[16361.21s -> 16363.77s]  hold on, hold on.
[16363.77s -> 16425.40s]  Hey guys, I'm telling you.
[16425.40s -> 16427.40s]  Oh my god, am I
[16427.40s -> 16429.58s]  a good Spider-Man? Let me fucking
[16429.58s -> 16432.78s]  tell you. I don't know, I can't, how am I going to
[16432.78s -> 16434.78s]  hook this thing, how am I, nobody's going to be able to hear, okay.
[16434.78s -> 16436.78s]  This is going to be with no audio.
[16436.78s -> 16438.78s]  I'm going to have to move around as Spider-Man with no audio.
[16438.78s -> 16441.02s]  I can't clip this thing to anything.
[16441.02s -> 16443.02s]  Can it, no way.
[16443.02s -> 16445.02s]  Alright, I'm going to,
[16445.02s -> 16447.02s]  there'll be a little bit of audio, I'm going to put the microphone
[16447.02s -> 16450.73s]  like over here. But excuse me.
[16450.73s -> 16453.35s]  Excuse me, fucking Peter Parker just showed up.
[16453.35s -> 16459.42s]  Peter Parker's here. Excuse me.
[16459.42s -> 16461.91s]  Peter Parker, thank you.
[16461.91s -> 16464.79s]  Peter Parker's here. Give me that fucking job.
[16464.79s -> 16470.79s]  Give me that role. Alright, let me,
[16470.79s -> 16474.57s]  I can't,
[16474.57s -> 16477.45s]  you guys are going to have to sit over here.
[16477.45s -> 16479.45s]  You're not going to be able to hear anything, but whatever.
[16479.45s -> 16481.75s]  This is just for Spider-Man anyways, so
[16481.75s -> 16527.56s]  whatever.
[16527.56s -> 16561.27s]  See you later, man.
[16561.27s -> 16567.67s]  Green Goblin! Gotcha!
[16567.67s -> 16575.66s]  You know, it's not a gotcha.
[16575.66s -> 16580.76s]  Drugs and alcohol.
[16580.76s -> 16583.00s]  Hi everyone, I'm Peter Parker.
[16583.00s -> 16585.69s]  A.K.A. Spider-Man.
[16585.69s -> 16596.18s]  Can you guys even hear?
[16596.18s -> 16604.04s]  No.
[16604.04s -> 16606.28s]  MJ, everyone knows I'm Spider-Man now.
[16606.28s -> 16609.10s]  What am I going to do? Don't you stand
[16609.10s -> 16612.87s]  like they've been thinking about my identity.
[16612.87s -> 16614.87s]  We're going to have to go underground, we're going to have to hide for a little while.
[16614.87s -> 16617.56s]  Listen to me, MJ.
[16617.56s -> 16619.74s]  We've got to hide for a while.
[16619.74s -> 16626.84s]  Everyone's going to know I'm Spider-Man.
[16626.84s -> 16628.84s]  MJ, come on, let's go.
[16628.84s -> 16637.66s]  All these people,
[16637.66s -> 16647.58s]  they know I'm Spider-Man.
[16647.58s -> 16649.58s]  MJ, tell them I'm a good guy.
[16649.58s -> 16660.46s]  What I was thinking is,
[16660.46s -> 16663.38s]  what if I, what if I put a different
[16663.38s -> 16665.38s]  costume on, a different suit,
[16665.38s -> 16667.38s]  and I wasn't Spider-Man?
[16667.38s -> 16669.38s]  What if I was a different character, and then everyone would know
[16669.38s -> 16671.38s]  that I was a different superhero?
[16671.38s -> 16673.38s]  Doesn't that fix everything?
[16673.38s -> 16675.38s]  Can't I just put on a different costume?
[16675.38s -> 16677.38s]  Well, I don't have to be Spider-Man.
[16677.38s -> 16679.38s]  I can be Mothboy.
[16679.38s -> 16681.38s]  No one's going to know I'm Spider-Man. There's so many weird
[16681.38s -> 16683.38s]  fucked up people in these universes that doesn't matter.
[16683.38s -> 16686.07s]  They'll just think,
[16686.07s -> 16688.07s]  we'll just say that Spider-Man got hit by a train
[16688.07s -> 16690.07s]  and it exploded
[16690.07s -> 16692.07s]  into blood and stuff.
[16692.07s -> 16694.07s]  I'm Mothboy.
[16694.07s -> 16701.24s]  Doesn't that fix everything?
[16712.39s -> 16717.00s]  Well, he already did that.
[16717.00s -> 16720.78s]  Mothboy.
[16720.78s -> 16722.78s]  But you're marketable.
[16722.78s -> 16724.78s]  You need to address the, I'm not addressing anything.
[16724.78s -> 16728.68s]  Yeah, hey, address this.
[16728.68s -> 16733.66s]  Nevermind. Did you hear the thing where I go,
[16733.66s -> 16735.66s]  oh, everybody goes like this, everybody goes like this in the movie.
[16735.66s -> 16738.28s]  Oh yeah, whatever, okay, everyone goes like this.
[16738.28s -> 16741.16s]  Edit that in. Alright, let me do some more spider moves.
[16741.16s -> 16743.16s]  I have to confront somebody. Who am I going to confront?
[16743.16s -> 16754.79s]  Jigsaw.
[16754.79s -> 16757.29s]  Hold on.
[16757.29s -> 16787.30s]  I'm just going to put you there.
[16787.30s -> 16805.59s]  Activate. I can see everything.
[16805.59s -> 16811.10s]  Activate laser sight.
[16811.10s -> 16813.46s]  You're not going to get away, Green Goblin.
[16813.46s -> 16820.30s]  Wait a minute. That's not Green Goblin.
[16820.30s -> 16833.42s]  Who's that new man?
[16833.42s -> 16845.32s]  Jigsaw. I just imagined Jigsaw flying around.
[16845.32s -> 16849.46s]  Wait a minute. Who's that?
[16849.46s -> 16852.02s]  That's not the Green Goblin.
[16852.02s -> 16857.66s]  That's someone else. Who's that?
[16857.66s -> 16869.35s]  A new villain.
[16869.35s -> 16871.35s]  You know what this is funny? This is implying that
[16871.35s -> 16873.35s]  Spider-Man had 40 Pornhub tabs open.
[16873.35s -> 16876.36s]  That's why Jigsaw
[16876.36s -> 16886.34s]  got him. I'm going to put the mask here.
[16886.34s -> 16888.34s]  I'm going to put the mask here
[16888.34s -> 16890.34s]  because Jigsaw got me
[16890.34s -> 16892.34s]  and he put my mask away
[16892.34s -> 16894.34s]  because everyone knows my identity.
[16894.34s -> 16896.34s]  Jigsaw took my mask off.
[16896.34s -> 16898.34s]  Because that ain't moving.
[16898.34s -> 16900.78s]  Is there a chair
[16900.78s -> 16903.21s]  I can put this on?
[16903.21s -> 16911.46s]  Give me the other mask too.
[16920.95s -> 16923.13s]  I don't know
[16923.13s -> 16925.13s]  where to put this.
[16925.13s -> 16930.63s]  Do I just hold it?
[16930.63s -> 16932.63s]  Maybe I could
[16932.63s -> 16935.70s]  set it here.
[16935.70s -> 16937.70s]  God.
[16937.70s -> 16939.70s]  Hold on.
[16939.70s -> 16941.70s]  I have to go this way.
[16941.70s -> 16943.70s]  Everybody don't look.
[16943.70s -> 16948.50s]  Nobody look.
[16948.50s -> 16950.50s]  Sitting down is like no fucking way.
[16957.42s -> 17001.94s]  Where am I? What's going on here?
[17001.94s -> 17010.84s]  Do you have an idea who you're dealing with?
[17010.84s -> 17020.74s]  I'm Spider-Man.
[17020.74s -> 17037.56s]  Well don't...
[17037.56s -> 17040.12s]  Usually I thought I cleared all that.
[17040.12s -> 17042.98s]  So what do I do? One minute?
[17042.98s -> 17045.86s]  One minute? Okay.
[17045.86s -> 17048.17s]  I got one minute on a clock. I can do this.
[17048.17s -> 17050.17s]  All these computers here?
[17050.17s -> 17052.17s]  Okay.
[17052.17s -> 17059.08s]  The clock is going on now.
[17059.08s -> 17061.08s]  Which one? Which one do I start with? First this one over here.
[17061.08s -> 17065.50s]  I'm going to hack into that.
[17065.50s -> 17069.14s]  I hacked it.
[17069.14s -> 17074.90s]  This one too. Got it. Got it. Got it.
[17074.90s -> 17076.90s]  There's only a few more.
[17076.90s -> 17083.18s]  Now that's thinking with webs.
[17083.18s -> 17085.93s]  I did what you wanted. I shut them all off.
[17085.93s -> 17094.04s]  What?
[17094.04s -> 17099.10s]  I did it? I won?
[17099.10s -> 17101.10s]  Okay.
[17101.10s -> 17111.27s]  I can't move the mask when I'm sitting down.
[17111.27s -> 17115.30s]  Don't you get it?
[17115.30s -> 17121.90s]  You look like an old man.
[17121.90s -> 17123.90s]  Hunching.
[17123.90s -> 17126.90s]  Hunching over.
[17126.90s -> 17130.23s]  That's so fucking stupid.
[17130.23s -> 17134.65s]  I love this
[17134.65s -> 17136.65s]  bizarre
[17136.65s -> 17139.08s]  fucked up shit.
[17139.08s -> 17141.08s]  Because everybody says there's no way it's going to get used
[17141.08s -> 17143.26s]  anywhere.
[17143.26s -> 17145.26s]  But it always does.
[17145.26s -> 17147.26s]  And somebody creatively uses this shit
[17147.26s -> 17149.26s]  and makes an insane video.
[17149.26s -> 17152.90s]  I can't fucking wait.
[17152.90s -> 17156.81s]  Twerk as Spider-Man?
[17156.81s -> 17158.81s]  It always works.
[17158.81s -> 17163.80s]  You guys are too creative.
[17163.80s -> 17166.17s]  Let me do some more stuff with Spider-Man.
[17166.17s -> 17169.82s]  Just like moving around and stuff.
[17169.82s -> 17172.12s]  When do I get to wear one of these?
[17172.12s -> 17174.12s]  When I stand up it's fine.
[17174.12s -> 17192.79s]  You don't need audio for this.
[17192.79s -> 17216.60s]  Can I see the lightsaber?
[17216.60s -> 17218.60s]  Those crazy Spider-Man Elsa videos.
[17218.60s -> 17220.60s]  You know what I mean?
[17220.60s -> 17222.60s]  Spider-Man with a lightsaber is like
[17222.60s -> 17224.60s]  coming around while he eats my hamburger buns.
[17224.60s -> 17233.69s]  This new technology
[17233.69s -> 17235.69s]  that Tony Stark made for me
[17235.69s -> 17247.34s]  sure is cool.
[17247.34s -> 17249.34s]  I'm here representing the Avengers.
[17249.34s -> 17289.85s]  Oh, you gotta get me doing that.
[17291.85s -> 17308.02s]  Bang! Bang!
[17308.02s -> 17310.02s]  This new technology that Tony Stark made
[17310.02s -> 17313.74s]  sure is interesting.
[17313.74s -> 17315.74s]  I wonder what I would call this.
[17315.74s -> 17317.74s]  An electric sword.
[17379.42s -> 17383.77s]  Who needs webs?
[17383.77s -> 17394.07s]  Start to cry?
[17394.07s -> 17400.92s]  It looks like you shit your pants.
[17400.92s -> 17404.82s]  Jeremy, you're gonna drop dead.
[17404.82s -> 17407.06s]  I'm alright.
[17407.06s -> 17409.06s]  I'm kind of at the end here.
[17409.06s -> 17414.06s]  Oh, do a superhero landing, yep.
[17414.06s -> 17428.25s]  Am I late?
[17428.25s -> 17441.29s]  Sorry I kept you all waiting.
[17441.29s -> 17443.29s]  You gotta cut out me laughing too.
[17443.29s -> 17446.68s]  It's too stupid.
[17446.68s -> 17451.98s]  Can I wrap this around?
[17451.98s -> 17454.54s]  I have a solution.
[17454.54s -> 17474.31s]  Where's the other hood?
[17474.31s -> 17494.84s]  It's time to fight some crime.
[17494.84s -> 17497.85s]  I need some adjustments to my suit.
[17497.85s -> 17502.97s]  I feel like it's a little more appropriate.
[17502.97s -> 17526.25s]  Let's go!
[17526.25s -> 17533.54s]  I hope this is okay.
[17533.54s -> 17535.54s]  He deserved it.
[17535.54s -> 17539.43s]  Why did it explode?
[17539.43s -> 17543.66s]  Why did it explode?
[17543.66s -> 17545.66s]  It fell four or five inches.
[17545.66s -> 17550.26s]  No, I'm taller than that.
[17550.26s -> 17552.26s]  Alright, I think it's like
[17552.26s -> 17554.26s]  I don't even know where this came from.
[17554.26s -> 17559.26s]  Whatever, it's fine.
[17559.26s -> 17561.26s]  Alright, what else can I do
[17561.26s -> 17563.26s]  in the next ten minutes?
[17563.26s -> 17565.26s]  Baseball Spider-Man?
[17568.84s -> 17570.84s]  Oh, I kind of did with the car thing.
[17575.13s -> 17580.12s]  This is so fun.
[17580.12s -> 17583.13s]  I'm so happy to do this again.
[17583.13s -> 17585.13s]  It really is so fucking fun.
[17585.13s -> 17591.66s]  What do you guys think?
[17591.66s -> 17593.66s]  Out of all the three times that I've done this
[17593.66s -> 17597.75s]  do you think you got enough to do some stuff?
[17597.75s -> 17604.15s]  Another ten minutes of stuff?
[17604.15s -> 17606.15s]  Because remember, you can use all footage
[17606.15s -> 17608.15s]  from every single time.
[17608.15s -> 17611.74s]  It's not just this one.
[17611.74s -> 17620.82s]  What other separate streams you can pull from now?
[17620.82s -> 17626.71s]  Do Patrick Bateman?
[17626.71s -> 17633.50s]  Do some more dancing.
[17633.50s -> 17643.03s]  You need to do more Star Wars.
[17643.03s -> 17645.66s]  Virtual ASMR murder.
[17645.66s -> 17655.32s]  I already did that though.
[17655.32s -> 17662.55s]  Alright, let me get a few more things out of the way.
[17662.55s -> 17665.24s]  What are some more things?
[17665.24s -> 17667.42s]  Honestly, you know what I'm looking forward to more than anything?
[17667.42s -> 17669.42s]  All the Super Mario shit.
[17669.42s -> 17671.42s]  Honest to God, I feel like the Mario stuff
[17671.42s -> 17674.10s]  combined with a few other things
[17674.10s -> 17676.10s]  could be gold.
[17676.10s -> 17684.86s]  I'm just telling you.
[17684.86s -> 17686.86s]  Yeah, there's a lot of other stuff to do.
[17686.86s -> 17689.16s]  I think we've got probably half the list.
[17689.16s -> 17698.04s]  Maybe a little bit less than half.
[17698.04s -> 17700.04s]  There were, what, six or seven
[17700.04s -> 17702.04s]  hundred suggestions.
[17702.04s -> 17704.04s]  This has taken down to like two hundred.
[17704.04s -> 17707.69s]  We did probably like fifty in five hours.
[17707.69s -> 17710.89s]  Do a bong rip?
[17710.89s -> 17714.34s]  I'll do a bong rip. Do the walk?
[17714.34s -> 17719.40s]  I'll do the walk with Spider-Man.
[17719.40s -> 17721.40s]  Oh, the pointing meme, right?
[17721.40s -> 17723.40s]  I'll do the pointing meme.
[17723.40s -> 17725.70s]  I'll do the walk.
[17725.70s -> 17727.70s]  I want to do a couple more things with Spider-Man.
[17727.70s -> 17731.16s]  I'll do some Spider-Man stuff.
[17731.16s -> 17733.16s]  Alright, you're not going to be able to hear me very well,
[17733.16s -> 17864.47s]  but I'm going over here.
[17864.47s -> 17866.47s]  He's going to puke?
[17866.47s -> 17875.43s]  No, I don't want to do it right into that.
[17875.43s -> 17901.46s]  It matches.
[17901.46s -> 17910.04s]  I don't know why I'm Spider-Man while I do that, but it's fine.
[17910.04s -> 17912.04s]  The hair. Do a bong rip?
[17912.04s -> 17918.82s]  Alright, fine. Here's your bong rip.
[17918.82s -> 17922.22s]  Do we have a bong? Yeah, I'll just pretend it's this.
[17922.22s -> 17974.41s]  You know, hold this.
[17974.41s -> 17982.02s]  So bad. You fucking...
[17982.02s -> 17984.02s]  He doesn't have to do the drug PSA.
[17984.02s -> 17991.38s]  Oh, the drug PSA.
[17991.38s -> 17996.76s]  Okay, what's the Miku dance?
[17996.76s -> 18003.03s]  The act out?
[18003.03s -> 18005.03s]  The death from the Thanos snap?
[18005.03s -> 18008.41s]  Oh.
[18008.41s -> 18010.78s]  That's sad though.
[18010.78s -> 18013.66s]  What does he do? Alright, I'll do it for you.
[18013.66s -> 18016.60s]  He's like lying down and he goes...
[18016.60s -> 18018.60s]  He just says, I don't feel so good.
[18018.60s -> 18025.00s]  He goes...
[18025.00s -> 18029.22s]  I don't know.
[18029.22s -> 18032.04s]  Mr. Stark,
[18032.04s -> 18034.47s]  I don't feel so good.
[18034.47s -> 18061.08s]  I'm still here.
[18061.08s -> 18065.16s]  Whoa.
[18065.16s -> 18068.04s]  Well, I'm still here.
[18068.04s -> 18075.08s]  Mr. Stark, I'm still here.
[18075.08s -> 18083.00s]  No, no.
[18083.00s -> 18085.00s]  Mr. Stark, what? Mr. Stark, what is this thing?
[18085.00s -> 18087.82s]  Mr. Stark, what's this little thing, Mr. Stark?
[18087.82s -> 18099.90s]  Why am I holding this, Mr. Stark?
[18099.90s -> 18101.90s]  Let me see what this is. I can't even shout the company out because
[18101.90s -> 18103.90s]  it's not focused.
[18103.90s -> 18114.06s]  Here, can you see?
[18114.06s -> 18116.06s]  This is Road Wireless Goes.
[18116.06s -> 18119.26s]  These things are fucking awesome.
[18119.26s -> 18122.84s]  These things saved the stream, by the way.
[18122.84s -> 18126.74s]  This is not sponsored.
[18126.74s -> 18128.74s]  I literally bought these
[18128.74s -> 18132.33s]  about, like, hours ago. These things are fucking awesome.
[18132.33s -> 18135.27s]  They're so little.
[18135.27s -> 18138.14s]  They can do anything.
[18138.14s -> 18142.68s]  Alright, one more thing and I'm going to clean up.
[18142.68s -> 18145.18s]  Road. It's the Road Wireless Microphones.
[18145.18s -> 18148.38s]  They're fucking awesome.
[18148.38s -> 18152.02s]  You get two.
[18152.02s -> 18154.02s]  It's been five hours, six hours. These things are still going.
[18154.02s -> 18157.35s]  This one's still going.
[18157.35s -> 18160.81s]  R-O-D-E. You can plug other shit into here, too.
[18160.81s -> 18165.85s]  Yeah, it's still...
[18165.85s -> 18167.85s]  Alright, guys.
[18167.85s -> 18169.85s]  We got to clean up. We have a hard exit here.
[18169.85s -> 18173.11s]  There's a hard stop here
[18173.11s -> 18175.48s]  in the next 40 minutes and we got to clean up.
[18175.48s -> 18178.92s]  We got through a lot.
[18178.92s -> 18180.92s]  There was a lot of shit to go through today.
[18180.92s -> 18185.00s]  So, the next time I stream
[18185.00s -> 18187.00s]  I will give you some really clear rules
[18187.00s -> 18189.18s]  because I can't really give them to you now
[18189.18s -> 18195.26s]  because we got to clean up.
[18195.26s -> 18197.43s]  Are you going to do a day two? Probably not.
[18197.43s -> 18208.04s]  Not soon.
[18208.04s -> 18212.65s]  I feel like there's a lot of
[18212.65s -> 18215.53s]  supplemental weird shit.
[18215.53s -> 18217.53s]  Yes, you're going to be able to use all three of the streams
[18217.53s -> 18220.34s]  and on top of that, you're also...
[18220.34s -> 18222.34s]  In the Discord
[18222.34s -> 18224.65s]  it will put some rules out.
[18224.65s -> 18226.82s]  We're going to have to be...
[18226.82s -> 18229.32s]  Let me just say this.
[18229.32s -> 18231.82s]  We're going to have to be insanely selective this time
[18231.82s -> 18233.82s]  because there's no way we're going to be able to get through the videos
[18233.82s -> 18235.82s]  that people are going to submit.
[18235.82s -> 18238.38s]  So, there's going to be... I really hate to say this
[18238.38s -> 18240.87s]  but there's going to be a really heavy, heavy
[18240.87s -> 18243.37s]  content quality filter.
[18243.37s -> 18245.67s]  Otherwise, it would just be dozens
[18245.67s -> 18247.67s]  and dozens and dozens of hours of videos
[18247.67s -> 18250.34s]  that we would never get through, ever.
[18250.34s -> 18252.34s]  So, we're going to have a pretty strict quality bar
[18252.34s -> 18254.34s]  that
[18254.34s -> 18257.10s]  is going to have to get met.
[18257.10s -> 18259.10s]  But that doesn't mean that funny, jokey, short
[18259.10s -> 18261.46s]  meme stuff won't get through.
[18261.46s -> 18263.46s]  It's just that we're going to have to make a lot of hard decisions on
[18263.46s -> 18265.46s]  what can actually show on stream.
[18265.46s -> 18267.46s]  Because even if I do an encore night, if we do a four to hour,
[18267.46s -> 18269.46s]  five hour, six hour stream
[18269.46s -> 18271.46s]  and do another six, seven hour stream
[18271.46s -> 18274.34s]  encore for these videos
[18274.34s -> 18276.34s]  we probably wouldn't even get through a tenth of them.
[18276.34s -> 18278.34s]  So, I've got to try to get
[18278.34s -> 18280.34s]  at least a quality bar
[18280.34s -> 18284.70s]  that's going to have to get passed.
[18284.70s -> 18286.70s]  And it will be in a playlist. The playlist will be available
[18286.70s -> 18291.50s]  a few times we've done it.
[18291.50s -> 18294.55s]  But yeah, I hope you guys had fun. I did.
[18294.55s -> 18297.43s]  I'm very tired though.
[18297.43s -> 18299.80s]  I forget how fun it is just to kind of be a
[18299.80s -> 18301.80s]  wacko and do all this.
[18301.80s -> 18303.80s]  So, hope it was entertaining.
[18303.80s -> 18306.55s]  I hope you can get some footage out of this
[18306.55s -> 18310.25s]  and combine it with the other two streams.
[18310.25s -> 18312.25s]  We'll see. Thank you so much for watching.
[18312.25s -> 18314.25s]  I'll see you guys later. The next stream will be
[18314.25s -> 18318.47s]  what's today? Today is the 30th.
[18318.47s -> 18321.74s]  Okay, so
[18321.74s -> 18325.24s]  maybe I'll be back on Sunday. Sunday the 3rd.
[18325.24s -> 18327.93s]  Oh, we're going to play Cuphead. Cuphead's DLC
[18327.93s -> 18329.93s]  Well, that's what I'm doing next. I'm going to stream Cuphead.
[18329.93s -> 18331.93s]  We're going to beat the DLC. Maybe in one day
[18331.93s -> 18334.36s]  I'll do two or three days, however long it takes.
[18334.36s -> 18337.56s]  Cuphead DLC coming soon.
[18337.56s -> 18339.56s]  I'll see you guys later. Thanks for watching.
[18339.56s -> 18341.56s]  Also, thanks to Holly. Holly, doing this by myself
[18341.56s -> 18343.56s]  the last few years was fucking unbelievably
[18343.56s -> 18346.82s]  hard. So, yeah. She did
[18346.82s -> 18348.82s]  a lot of help here. Just helping with props
[18348.82s -> 18350.82s]  and costumes and compiling stuff.
[18350.82s -> 18352.82s]  So, that was a big help. So, it was a lot of fun.
[18352.82s -> 18354.82s]  Thanks everyone.
[18354.82s -> 18356.82s]  I'll see you guys on
[18356.82s -> 18358.82s]  Sunday. Good night.
[18358.82s -> 18360.82s]  Goodbye. Take care, guys.
[18360.82s -> 18362.82s]  Call your mother. You know the deal.
[18362.82s -> 18365.00s]  See you later.
