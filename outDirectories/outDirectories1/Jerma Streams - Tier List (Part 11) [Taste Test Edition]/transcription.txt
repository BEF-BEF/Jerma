[4.73s -> 12.54s]  Hi, how are you? I'm a little late. I'm a little late, but there's a reason why I'm a little late.
[13.10s -> 26.98s]  I'm not six hours late. I'm two and a half hours late because I needed a cable. I needed to get
[26.98s -> 32.71s]  the table set up a little. It's just a little. I'm just a little bit late and I don't want to
[32.71s -> 36.15s]  get too loud because I don't know the acoustics of this room. And I guess I said acoustics.
[36.95s -> 43.86s]  Well, here's my problem. I said, oh man, 2 p.m. or earlier, dude. 2 p.m. sounds good, man.
[44.58s -> 47.78s]  But then I was like, you know, I, me and Holly was setting up a table.
[49.54s -> 60.82s]  What, what are you, what are we even doing today? Okay, there's one guy two nights ago that said
[60.82s -> 65.22s]  we were doing tier lists and we talked about my candy preferences, my snack preferences.
[66.18s -> 72.28s]  And I, there's a lot of stuff that I have in F or D, right? Don't blame it on Holly. I didn't,
[72.28s -> 77.16s]  I said we're setting the table up. It's, I, it's my fault. I should have, I should have taken
[77.16s -> 83.38s]  precedence and started setting the table up yesterday. It's my fault. How are you? I'm
[83.38s -> 87.66s]  doing good. I'm doing good. There's going to be a system here too. So people that,
[87.66s -> 92.06s]  there were a lot of people concerned in the pre-stream chat. They're like, dude, um, but wait,
[92.06s -> 95.82s]  wait, wait, wait, back up, back up, back up. Don't call me a 2K Andy. It's been five seconds.
[97.59s -> 103.19s]  At 2K, 2,000 live viewers is a shitload. That's a fucking shitload of people.
[103.91s -> 113.77s]  So 2K Andy, that's huge. Anyways, and that guy for like a few minutes. All right. So listen,
[113.77s -> 117.85s]  here we go. We've been doing tier lists. People in pre-stream were kind of concerned.
[118.41s -> 122.41s]  They're like, oh, hey, oh, so you, we got, there's a lot of, there's a lot of history.
[122.41s -> 130.09s]  Let's back up like two days. I said, I never have eaten a trolley before. Trolley, a trolley. I
[130.09s -> 135.27s]  don't know. I don't, I don't eat these fucking things. I put it in F tier and everybody freaked
[135.27s -> 140.15s]  out. It was like, dude, you can't put a trolley in F tier. Like, and I'm like,
[140.15s -> 144.07s]  they're gross. It's a gummy worm. They're stupid. And then they said, you have, you eat one on stream
[144.07s -> 152.68s]  and prove that you don't like it. I was like, okay, fine. But how about we eat 45 of all the
[152.68s -> 159.24s]  candies and snacks and breads, fruits, sodas, stuff that I've put in F tier and see if I'm full of
[159.24s -> 170.94s]  shit. He's absolutely insane. So I, we, there's a lot of stuff here and I, I, I, I'm not ready
[170.94s -> 179.59s]  to show you yet. This is going to kill him. This, I'm not, this, listen, I have a system in place.
[180.15s -> 187.61s]  Okay. My system is going to go as follows. I'm not going to eat every piece of candy. I'm not
[187.61s -> 193.75s]  going to open, for instance, the gross Almond Joy and eat the whole, I'm not going to eat the whole
[193.75s -> 201.72s]  bar of Almond Joy. Holly loves those. She's very upset about this. No, I'm not, I'm not going to
[201.72s -> 208.34s]  eat the whole bar of candy. Are you crazy? We're going to go from category to category. We're
[208.34s -> 214.50s]  going to start because I, there's, there's fruits here. We're going to start with fruit. I'm going
[214.50s -> 219.80s]  to eat, I'm going to take a bite, a few bites of fruit and I'm going to move it onto the side.
[219.80s -> 225.96s]  Something that I forgot completely. I need like a separate table to put the stuff that, oh, you
[225.96s -> 231.27s]  know, it doesn't matter. It can just stay here. I'm not eating the whole thing. We're going to go
[231.27s -> 237.85s]  category to category. We're going fruits. Okay. Take one bite. Contemplate it for a few minutes.
[238.90s -> 247.98s]  Place it on a new tier list. Then we're going to probably to chocolate like Almond Joy, Mounds,
[247.98s -> 252.70s]  Tootsie Roll. We're going to go category to category so I don't throw up. If for, look,
[252.70s -> 256.87s]  if for some reason I'm going to puke, it's not going to happen. I'm not going to puke.
[256.87s -> 263.66s]  Everybody's relaxed. Okay. Anything that I don't open is going to get donated. So if I don't get
[263.66s -> 266.38s]  to something, if I'm like, you know what, I'm not even going to fucking open that. I don't want it.
[266.38s -> 273.19s]  It's going to, I'm going to donate it. Anything that is opened is going to be eaten. There's going
[273.19s -> 279.70s]  to be like six months worth of candy here. I will eat these Milk Duds even if I don't like them.
[279.70s -> 284.60s]  Okay. So don't worry. All these things are shelf stable for at least like a few weeks, at least.
[285.16s -> 292.79s]  So yeah, like let's, let's say if I'm full of shit. Yeah. I'm not, look,
[292.79s -> 298.04s]  Holly likes some of this stuff. I, you know, I, I might like it too. We'll find out.
[299.14s -> 303.74s]  This game sucks. Can you play something else? I'm not going to puke. Everyone's so, I'm not
[303.74s -> 309.05s]  going to fucking throw up. Okay. Am I on camera yet? Okay. Hold on. I don't think you guys are
[309.05s -> 313.29s]  ready for this reveal. Yeah. I like, look, one guy made this whole fucking stream happen
[313.29s -> 317.72s]  and that's kind of how it works. I did this bread too. I actually probably will eat,
[317.72s -> 321.82s]  we're going to eat this bread. So don't worry. All right. Just go ahead and reveal it. Let's just,
[321.82s -> 329.91s]  like, let's get it over with. Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead and show, show the table. Okay. Hi.
[329.91s -> 336.92s]  There's a lot here. Uh, I thought I'd like a fun, maybe like a funny joke would have been, uh,
[336.92s -> 342.50s]  would have been to do this. Are you ready? Like, okay. This looks like all those food eating
[342.50s -> 347.85s]  videos. What the fuck is he doing? You're going to get fat. Nice shirt. It's a Millennium Falcon.
[347.85s -> 353.16s]  Relax. All right. So already like all this shit is here. I got to do this. This is for me.
[353.16s -> 360.50s]  Ready? Like, okay. Now somebody edit in like a bunch of noodles going in my mouth for the
[360.50s -> 369.77s]  thumbnail. Ryan's toy review. Okay. Now hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I got, you got, you got
[369.77s -> 376.55s]  to edit a big mozzarella stick right here. Ready? Like, you know what I mean? You got to get the
[376.55s -> 383.10s]  mozzarella stick. Nice plate. What? I actually kind of don't want to eat that, but whatever.
[383.10s -> 389.32s]  All right. Yes. Look, I know people like don't waste food. I'm not going to waste this. These
[389.32s -> 393.56s]  bags of, I think it can be rolled up and sealed and they can be eaten later. I'm not going to
[393.56s -> 399.08s]  throw any of this shit away. I will eat it. This bag of Tootsie Rolls is going to last six years.
[399.08s -> 402.60s]  This is going to last six years. It's going to last a very, very long time. So don't worry.
[402.60s -> 408.65s]  I don't want to mess up the setup. It looks good. How long do Tootsie Rolls even last? Does anybody
[408.65s -> 416.54s]  know? Happy birthday. Drink the hot sauce. All right. Let me, let me reiterate what's going on
[416.54s -> 423.64s]  here because people are confused. Nice window behind you. Just let this on in. They last,
[423.64s -> 428.44s]  they last a long time. Six years, hundreds of years. Is there an expiration date on Tootsie
[428.44s -> 438.23s]  Rolls? Is there actually an expiration date? I don't think there's an expiration date.
[443.66s -> 450.52s]  The Last Supper. Yeah. Remember when Jesus ate a bunch of fucking chili cheese Fritos with like
[450.52s -> 456.79s]  Joseph and Peter? Remember when they had the hot tamales and like Jesus, like Jesus, like gave a
[456.79s -> 462.20s]  hot tamale to Peter and he fucking, he didn't like it. He almost puked. No suit. Guys, I was already
[462.20s -> 466.12s]  30 minutes late and you wanted me to have a suit on. I was going to take me like another 40 minutes
[466.12s -> 471.80s]  to get here. So I'm sorry. There's no suit. There's no telephone. It's all right. So let's,
[471.80s -> 477.18s]  let's go. Let's go. Here we go. Just to show you kind of how this is going to work. Right here
[477.18s -> 481.00s]  would be, this should be the tier list, right? I'm going to show them for a second.
[482.31s -> 485.59s]  I'm going to, I'm, we're going to face my own bullshit. We're going to see. I got, if I don't
[485.59s -> 491.61s]  like it, it's going to F. Star Wars shirt. Yeah, I know. Suit next stream. I'm not just going to
[491.61s -> 498.34s]  wear a suit for fun. We got to start with the fruit because it's going to go bad if I don't
[498.34s -> 507.61s]  eat it like right now. So everything on that list right there. Okay. Everything on that list right
[507.61s -> 515.59s]  there is stuff that has been an F. All my F candies, all my F chips, all my F sodas. Hey,
[515.59s -> 519.85s]  well, hold on a minute. That's not F. Why is this up here? Oh, right. Cause I was going to,
[519.85s -> 525.51s]  I was going to do on stream. I was going to do the, the, the, the Coke versus Pepsi taste
[525.51s -> 531.64s]  test challenge. I mean, I already know which one I like, but do you stick around for the whole
[531.64s -> 537.64s]  video to find out? I'm doing that at the very fucking end. Make sure the fucking algorithm
[537.64s -> 544.01s]  gives me extra views. Okay. So this is a red delicious apple. They taste like shit. They smell
[544.01s -> 549.35s]  like shit and they kind of look like shit. I know that I don't like red delicious. Everybody. Who
[549.35s -> 553.69s]  does? I don't think anybody does. Are they warm? These are freezing cold. I just got them out of
[553.69s -> 559.34s]  the fridge. We're going to find out if I actually really hate these. I have not. Okay. Here's another
[559.34s -> 564.28s]  thing that really important to understand. Everything that's on this table. I don't think
[564.28s -> 570.55s]  I've had in like five to 10 years because I know I don't like it. Right. Why would you eat
[570.55s -> 589.50s]  something you don't like? You ready? Red delicious apple first. Here we go. Oh, that was like a,
[589.50s -> 607.37s]  there's a growth spot right there. Can you see the growth spot? Hold on. Let me do that again.
[607.37s -> 618.62s]  Okay. No, a spit bucket. Oh, apples. No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I have to swallow it. Right.
[618.62s -> 623.66s]  I got to, I got to come on. I got to be a man sized sandwich. I got to swallow it. Okay. Well,
[623.66s -> 632.71s]  hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Important. Actually really isn't that bad. One more. I don't, I can't
[632.71s -> 647.26s]  take more than like two bites. The skin sucks. The skin is like weird. These are actually really,
[647.26s -> 650.07s]  they're very sweet. That's, I think that's one of the reasons why I don't like them.
[650.07s -> 655.59s]  Need a big bite. That, look at how big of a bite that is. What kind of mouth do you have if that's
[655.59s -> 671.30s]  the one bite you take? Why do I have like a joker mouth? I, this is not F. It's not F. It's not F
[671.30s -> 687.43s]  though. Fuck. This is actually kind of good. I wouldn't like one of, okay. It's not, it's not B.
[687.43s -> 698.07s]  It's probably C. I think Red Delicious Apple is going to C. This table is shaking. Because
[699.37s -> 705.99s]  like the AC just turned on. I thought like the fucking room was shaking. Yeah. That's a C.
[705.99s -> 715.85s]  That's a C. It's not an F. Don't, no, no. I got like a million things to eat. All right. So that
[715.85s -> 720.47s]  Red Delicious, not an F. It's a C. They're a little too sweet. I'd rather, okay, for sweet,
[720.47s -> 725.38s]  I'd rather just get a green apple, which is sweet and sour. It's really good. All right.
[725.38s -> 733.82s]  Now we're staying in fruit. Next up, this is a cantaloupe. So this is cantaloupe. Cantaloupe
[733.82s -> 738.87s]  is the thing that I always avoid in a fruit cup. I always just eat around it. I say this is F.
[738.87s -> 746.57s]  I haven't eaten in probably five years. Shall we see if I like it? Cantaloupe. Let me get the
[746.57s -> 753.26s]  apple out. Actually, no. Put, put Red Delicious to D. Put it down to D. No, it's D. It's D. The skin
[753.26s -> 760.70s]  is still in my mouth. I'm still eating skin. D. I'm like eat, it's like eating film. Yeah. D.
[760.70s -> 770.01s]  Fucking absolutely D. It's still there. I've swallowed 15 times. Yeah. I swallowed like 15.
[770.01s -> 775.59s]  That's D. Absolutely. Red Delicious Apple D. It's still there. It's still skin in my fucking mouth.
[775.59s -> 790.34s]  It's in my teeth. It's like popcorn. Cantaloupe. Here we go. Oh, juicy. Watch. Oh my god.
[790.34s -> 814.50s]  That's all. Somebody said this is going to make me sick. I just, I took a bite out of a fucking
[814.50s -> 829.83s]  apple. What do you mean? Why? Cantaloupe is, it's okay. You're not using a fork. It's a fruit,
[829.83s -> 838.76s]  man. What do you want me to do? It's not sticky. Yeah, it is. Okay. Cantaloupe. I said it was F.
[850.34s -> 856.28s]  Oh, my palate cleanser. Right. I got pickled ginger, but no, I don't think so. I think that
[856.28s -> 860.12s]  would, I would actually puke if I ate that right now. Yeah. I was going to do this joke where,
[860.12s -> 863.32s]  you know, when you go to sushi restaurant and you order sushi and you're supposed to use the
[863.32s -> 867.40s]  pickled ginger as a palate cleanser between each item. I was like, oh, that's kind of funny. What
[867.40s -> 872.58s]  if like after every bite, I cleanse my palate with some ginger. But I don't think that would,
[872.58s -> 879.82s]  I think I would actually throw up if I did that. So, no, we're not doing that. Okay. Cantaloupe.
[879.82s -> 891.91s]  Stop distracting me. See, it's juicy. It's got, it's got a good juice to it. I think it's a C.
[891.91s -> 899.80s]  So here we go. Here's Cantaloupe 2, which is honeydew melon. It's just, this is, I'm going to,
[899.80s -> 902.84s]  it's going to be the exact same score. They're, they're the exact same thing. They taste exactly
[902.84s -> 910.63s]  the same. They're the same exact product. They're exactly the same. This is fucking awful. This is
[910.63s -> 916.47s]  dog shit. This is literal dog shit. Yeah. This doesn't taste like anything. This tastes like
[916.47s -> 929.27s]  nothing. All I taste is water and like somebody sprayed Lysol in another room. This is awful.
[929.27s -> 937.62s]  Honeydew melon. Holy fuck. Literal F. I'm not changing my goddamn mind. It's juicy, but it
[937.62s -> 944.34s]  just tastes like somebody sprayed like fucking fabric softener in another room. F. F for honeydew
[944.34s -> 953.74s]  melon. F. This is a grapefruit. The reason why I don't like grapefruit is because it's usually
[953.74s -> 960.10s]  very acidic, like way too acidic and it tastes like kind of stomach acid and it smells like
[960.10s -> 967.24s]  kind of good. You're wrong. I'm, I'm literally sitting here telling you that I'm eating these
[967.24s -> 970.92s]  things and giving you my opinion. I'm trying to make, I'm giving you my honest opinions. I'm
[970.92s -> 979.26s]  not going to put any fluff on it. Okay. Grapefruit. All these, remember everything here I put an F
[979.26s -> 993.05s]  at some point over the last few years. Grapefruit. Here we go. Nice Buzzfeed video. I know. But look,
[993.05s -> 999.69s]  I, I, I, I, I, I, I, come on. Here we go. All right. Grapefruit. I actually don't want to bite
[999.69s -> 1016.78s]  this. I like, I know I hate these. Let's find out. It's fucking awful. It just tastes like acid.
[1017.85s -> 1023.86s]  It's, it's, it's acid. It's just acid. Are these even, okay. Are these good for you? Are these even
[1023.86s -> 1034.42s]  good for you? Are these good for you? You need to put sugar on it. No, no, no. I'm not going to do
[1034.42s -> 1038.98s]  the thing to make the thing supposed to taste better by adding bullshit to it. This is just
[1038.98s -> 1044.38s]  the way it is. What you, okay. Oh dude, take the red delicious apple and put caramel all over it.
[1044.38s -> 1052.71s]  And then you'll like it. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. These are F. This is bad. This stays in F. Where
[1052.71s -> 1061.14s]  it belongs. Yeah. I know. You cut the thing in half and you like shake fucking 50 grams of sugar
[1061.14s -> 1065.62s]  all over the thing. So it gets sapped in and seeps into the actual fruit and then you can eat it.
[1065.62s -> 1072.94s]  No, no, no. Oh yeah. Are you guys the same people that put sugar on your cornflakes? When you order,
[1073.18s -> 1077.34s]  when you order cornflakes, do you put the cornflakes, which goes up in front of your table
[1077.98s -> 1083.93s]  and you put sugar all over it? It's the same exact thing. It's an animal style grapefruit.
[1083.93s -> 1090.04s]  It's how you're supposed to eat it. I'm just telling you right now, the fruit by itself is enough.
[1090.60s -> 1095.56s]  If you add sugar to something, a shitload of sugar, it's like, yeah, it's probably going to be better.
[1095.56s -> 1100.01s]  I mean, I could literally probably open up the Fun Dip and like put it on there. And then it's
[1100.01s -> 1109.58s]  like the same thing. God, Fun Dip sucks. So if somebody already has a thumbnail. Oh, I want to
[1109.58s -> 1135.75s]  see. I'm coming. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. Okay. Fruits are done. I was wrong about
[1135.75s -> 1143.77s]  cantaloupe. Red Delicious said, I don't know if they're F. They're okay. All right. In the same
[1143.77s -> 1152.34s]  realm, we're going to go to, these are cold. We're going to do these now. So we're going to do sodas.
[1153.53s -> 1163.85s]  This is Diet Mountain Dew, which is wrong. Mountain Dew is an F for me. So Diet Mountain
[1163.85s -> 1170.09s]  Dew is probably like not allowed to even be scored. Diet Mountain Dew is probably fucking
[1170.09s -> 1179.42s]  terrible. It's disgusting. I don't, it sucks. Diet. Why would you make Diet Mountain Dew? Why?
[1179.42s -> 1185.06s]  What's the point of making a Diet Mountain Dew? Listen to that. Hold on. This is for the video.
[1185.06s -> 1198.12s]  This is for the fucking like eating, like eating channel video. Okay. It smells. How does it smell?
[1198.12s -> 1223.82s]  Diet Mountain Dew. You ready? Let's give you the honest opinion. She said you. You guys don't
[1223.82s -> 1231.48s]  understand. So I can hear her in like the other room or if she's like working on something
[1231.48s -> 1237.21s]  somewhere else in like, in the house, I will hear, I will do something weird and I'll hear, oh,
[1237.21s -> 1248.41s]  I can hear it from the other room. Oh, this is very bad. It's very bad. Do I think this is better
[1248.41s -> 1257.30s]  than actual Mountain Dew? Weirdly, yes, I do. Okay. Mountain Dew is way too sugary and tastes way,
[1257.30s -> 1263.46s]  it's just like pure sugar. So for some reason, this is better than Mountain Dew. What's in it?
[1263.46s -> 1273.94s]  Wait, hold on. Aspartame. I'm going to go ahead and seal that. We're going to go ahead and seal
[1273.94s -> 1280.81s]  that and we're going to just go ahead and seal that. Does all Diet Soda have aspartame in it?
[1280.81s -> 1291.08s]  Put the cap on it. I am. Somebody will drink this. Maybe not. Somebody will drink this.
[1291.98s -> 1295.26s]  Diet Mountain Dew? Dog shit. It's fucking awful. It's literally F, but it's better than regular
[1295.26s -> 1298.94s]  Mountain Dew. I'm sorry. I just don't like Mountain Dew. I know people love Mountain Dew. Oh,
[1298.94s -> 1303.10s]  Mountain Dew is so good. I don't like it. I think it's bad. Here's Squirt. Did I put this in F or
[1303.18s -> 1316.46s]  I never tried this? Oh, it's Grapefruit Soda. I don't want it. Hold on. I got a really funny
[1316.46s -> 1326.26s]  joke coming up. Stay tuned. This is Squirt. There you go. Squirt. I guess I never had this.
[1326.26s -> 1347.59s]  Why did I put it in F? Oh, that's nice. Oh, okay. I drink it. I've had Fresca before. Oh,
[1347.59s -> 1354.81s]  did we put Mountain Dew in F? Okay, just making sure. Squirt. I've had Fresca. Fresca's a little
[1354.81s -> 1365.21s]  too harsh somehow. This is pretty smooth. I don't know why I just feel like I was being held hostage.
[1369.53s -> 1372.57s]  I don't know why. I just like looked up. There's like, I don't know. It's like,
[1372.57s -> 1379.74s]  why am I being held hostage right now? Like, what is happening? He loves it. I actually,
[1379.74s -> 1394.66s]  it's pretty good. All right, one more sip and then I'll put it away. I think this is a solid B.
[1394.66s -> 1407.62s]  I think Squirt's a solid B. It's not, I can tell if I'm gonna start like, it's a lot, it's bubbly.
[1407.62s -> 1415.48s]  He's breaking from the simulation. I think this is a B. I would drink this again and I will because
[1415.48s -> 1420.18s]  it's gonna go in the fridge and I'm gonna drink it later. Ah, Squirt's a B. That's, I'm actually
[1420.18s -> 1425.93s]  very surprised. It's lighter than Fresca somehow. I can't hide. I literally can't hide. Yes, I can.
[1428.89s -> 1438.87s]  Okay. I couldn't, there's literally nothing I could do to stop that. I could not stop that.
[1438.87s -> 1444.46s]  It was impossible. It was literally impossible. Should I make it lower grade? No, should I make
[1444.46s -> 1447.66s]  it a lower grade because like, holy shit, that was like fucking violent. I couldn't even,
[1447.66s -> 1465.61s]  I couldn't stop that. Oh, you can mute. That's right. Imagine if I just mute down here. Dude,
[1465.61s -> 1471.21s]  I would never be able to like, okay, we've talked a lot of shit about like, like, okay, sponsorships,
[1471.21s -> 1474.33s]  right? Like, I'm gonna start doing sponsors. Maybe you've seen one. Maybe you see another
[1474.33s -> 1482.30s]  at some point, right? Like if I were to fucking just puke down here, this would never be allowed
[1482.30s -> 1485.98s]  on my stream ever. Even if like, okay, yeah, you've said some things that you were like,
[1485.98s -> 1490.14s]  you were just joking around. I drank a squirt and I puked down my shirt, right? That would be
[1490.14s -> 1494.98s]  impossible to, I couldn't hide that. You guys, the second, it would have been possible. I would,
[1494.98s -> 1499.82s]  it would be possible. Whatever. It's a B. I think it's a high B. All right, sodas. We still, oh,
[1500.78s -> 1511.75s]  no, I'm okay. I should be fine. This is A&W cream soda, which is only good when there's like
[1513.83s -> 1522.90s]  a little bit of ice cream in it. I really don't like this at all. The bubbles are like still
[1522.90s -> 1527.98s]  there. I'm all right. What if I just fucking, dude, if I puke and like whatever, if I have like a
[1527.98s -> 1534.66s]  soda puke, I will live forever, okay? If I take, if I took a big chunk of soda and like the bubbles
[1534.66s -> 1539.22s]  come up and I puke, I live forever. I will live forever. Like that'll be shared for like the next
[1539.22s -> 1542.82s]  hundred years. I will literally be the, I'll be the guy that like puked on his stream like with bubble
[1542.82s -> 1546.74s]  pukes and I will live forever. I will never die. It'll be impossible for me. I'll live forever.
[1546.74s -> 1551.61s]  Okay, oh, this is the joke I was gonna make. No, that's disgusting. Why would I make that joke?
[1551.61s -> 1555.83s]  I was gonna make it like a fart thing where I was gonna be like, you know what I mean? Like
[1556.81s -> 1565.80s]  you know what I'm saying? Do you guys want music? How you guys feel? You guys want some,
[1565.80s -> 1576.15s]  want some tunes in the background? Cream soda smells amazing, but I don't like how it tastes.
[1576.15s -> 1583.78s]  No music? No, no music. Okay, all right. You guys can put your own soundtrack in the background if
[1583.78s -> 1593.58s]  you want. Okay, so here we go. This is A&W cream soda. I actually am a huge fan of A&W root beer,
[1593.58s -> 1599.08s]  but I'm not a big fan of cream soda. Cream soda is, you take one sip and yeah, that's enough.
[1599.08s -> 1602.20s]  You've had enough, which I'm sure it's going to happen here because after the first sip,
[1602.20s -> 1609.50s]  you get like immune to the flavor. Let's see if it happens. One sip, delicious, kind of sugary,
[1609.50s -> 1624.38s]  way too much, a little too much. Second, third sip, I'm immune to the flavor. What the fuck?
[1624.38s -> 1642.95s]  Oh my God. Huh? Oh my God. There's 77, 76 grams of sugar in this bottle. Wait, no, yeah. 76 grams
[1642.95s -> 1658.22s]  of sugar? I thought it was like 40. What's in a Coke? 60, 65. God damn, that's a lot of sugar.
[1658.22s -> 1664.57s]  Okay, so again, like my issue with cream soda is I can tell you, I knew it was going to be bad.
[1664.57s -> 1673.43s]  It's like syrupy. It's thicker than a regular soda. It's thick. Yeah, and now I'm immune to
[1673.43s -> 1679.80s]  the flavor. I don't, I taste like kind of sweetness and bubbles. The cream soda flavor doesn't exist.
[1679.80s -> 1697.62s]  This goes good on ice cream. This goes good on ice cream, I think. Is it creamy? I mean,
[1697.62s -> 1701.86s]  I think like this sitting at the bottom of vanilla ice cream, like just like in a little pool would
[1701.86s -> 1708.97s]  be kind of pretty good. Are they going to float? 76 grams of sugar. These are all so sugary. What
[1708.97s -> 1721.29s]  is the lowest one? Oh, squirt based. 63. What about Pepsi? 69, 65. Squirt's got the lowest sugar so far.
[1721.29s -> 1729.77s]  Of course it does, based. All right, that's cream soda. It's uh, it's F. It just is. It's just,
[1729.77s -> 1739.86s]  you can't enjoy, I can't enjoy it. I actually, I just really can't enjoy that. Okay, if I wasn't
[1739.86s -> 1749.85s]  drinking it, if it was used as a sauce, sure. Okay, bubbles are coming up. Nice, nice based.
[1749.85s -> 1756.22s]  Is it Bussin? No, it's not. My root beer. It's just, yeah, it's kind of just shitty root beer.
[1756.22s -> 1762.12s]  And again, let me be very clear. I love A&W root beer. I think it's fantastic. It's probably the
[1762.12s -> 1770.55s]  best. Mug beats it by a lot, I think, but I think it's still incredibly good based on what?
[1770.55s -> 1779.11s]  Epo. What about squirt over cream? Well, I mean, cream, cream soda's F. This is B. All right,
[1779.11s -> 1787.72s]  it's time to do... No, no, this is good. I'm fine. I mean, guys, people, here's the thing.
[1787.72s -> 1792.78s]  A lot of people are concerned about this stream, but I will tell you right now, I have been high
[1792.78s -> 1798.49s]  and eaten like all this shit before. Guys, I've been high and eaten an entire tub of Ben and
[1798.49s -> 1804.62s]  Jerry's ice cream. I think I'm going to be okay. Like I've eaten like Cheez-Its, Ben and Jerry's
[1804.62s -> 1811.21s]  ice cream, um, like banana cream pie in the same night with Cheez-Its and shit. So like,
[1811.21s -> 1815.53s]  I think I'd be fine, especially if I don't do that much. I know I don't like Diet Coke,
[1815.53s -> 1823.75s]  but I put it in F so I have to re-remember why. I actually would, I'll use that as a sauce. So,
[1823.75s -> 1833.88s]  he's high right now. Does your doctor know about this? You want to call my doctor and say,
[1834.52s -> 1839.08s]  hey, hey, hey, hey, doctor, yeah, I'm just very concerned. I wanted to call you about a few
[1839.08s -> 1844.54s]  things. Oh, what is it? What can I help you with? I'm eating Almond Joys and I'm eating a bunch of
[1844.54s -> 1849.26s]  candy today. I'm eating a Tootsie Roll. I'm eating one bite of an Almond Joy and taking a sip of
[1849.26s -> 1862.02s]  cream soda. Am I going to be all right? He's going to hang up on me. This is Diet Coke. Don't blow
[1862.02s -> 1878.10s]  up. Oh, okay. Dude, you're going to have to go to the emergency room. No, I'm fine. Guys, do you
[1878.10s -> 1884.49s]  understand that there are, there are people that like drink like five of these in a day? All of,
[1884.49s -> 1891.00s]  okay, all the concerned Andes in here. How many fucking monsters did you have today? How many
[1891.00s -> 1897.69s]  monsters did you have today? How many, how many, how many of those have you had today? Interesting.
[1897.69s -> 1906.82s]  Don't take a sip out of cream soda, Jeremy, but like, oh yeah, monster, extra fire, whatever the
[1906.82s -> 1914.06s]  fuck it is. Zero, zero, zero, zero to my entire life. All right, well, whatever. You understand
[1914.06s -> 1926.12s]  this is Coke and it's F. This is Diet Coke. Whoa, be careful. Yeah, it's F. It sucks. Not changing
[1926.12s -> 1930.60s]  my opinion on Diet Coke. Diet Coke just tastes like regular Coke that went through like a
[1930.60s -> 1947.10s]  britter water filter. It's, it's, it's, it's, no, no, I don't think so. I wouldn't want to drink a
[1947.10s -> 1951.82s]  whole one of these. You know what I mean? I don't, I don't want to drink a whole one of these.
[1951.82s -> 1965.14s]  People drink a shitload of this. It just like sucks. Zero calories. How many calories are in
[1965.14s -> 1978.17s]  just a regular Coke? 240. This sucks. That's what the mini cans are for. Yeah, dude. Okay.
[1978.90s -> 1984.50s]  People, let me tell you something. The mini cans and the mini little ones. Oh, that's good. That's
[1984.50s -> 1987.86s]  good shit. You should, that's fine. Drink one of those. You can make those go a long way. You know
[1987.86s -> 1994.20s]  how? I'm going to give you a tip here. Here's a tip. Get a big cup like this and fill the fucking
[1994.20s -> 2004.15s]  thing with ice. I'm not going to puke. No, I'm not going to puke. It's literally just bubbles.
[2005.14s -> 2010.39s]  Every time I drink soda, I get like fucking gassy. Okay. So don't everybody freak out.
[2010.39s -> 2016.66s]  You get, you get a big cup like this and you fill the fucking thing with ice. I'm talking to the
[2016.66s -> 2021.93s]  brim. When you pour in half of that goddamn can, it's going to fill the whole thing and you can
[2021.93s -> 2026.49s]  enjoy it for like an hour if you want to. Right? You don't have to drink that much soda. Fill ice
[2026.49s -> 2030.49s]  and dilute it. It's fine. A little bit of dilution is fine. You know, it's not going to make you sick.
[2030.73s -> 2037.64s]  Why would it make you sick? Get a bucket. I'm not, I don't need a bucket. All right. The last thing
[2037.64s -> 2044.90s]  I'm going to do is I'm going to, this has nothing to do with the tier list. Put this over here.
[2044.90s -> 2053.38s]  Yeah, it's up. We're going to do the Coke versus Pepsi blind taste test. Actually,
[2053.38s -> 2059.77s]  I think I might need you to come in here. I, I, I'll know. I'll know. Right. Okay. Hold on.
[2059.77s -> 2070.55s]  Let's open them both. So I don't want to, I don't want any bias here. This is the Coke. Oh,
[2070.55s -> 2074.39s]  the shape, right? Yeah. The different shapes. Ah, it should be fine. I'll just grab it weirdly.
[2076.66s -> 2086.78s]  Okay. This, this is Pepsi. This is Coke. Yeah. I'm going to drink pretty much all this stuff.
[2086.78s -> 2091.26s]  Okay. So, um, I'm going to, I'm going to hand, I'm going to, actually here. Probably easier
[2091.26s -> 2094.36s]  if you're just ready. So I'm going to close my eyes and I don't want to know which one you're
[2094.36s -> 2112.22s]  handing me. It could be either one and just stick it in the cup holder. Oh, I know that taste. That
[2112.22s -> 2129.54s]  is the classic, classic Coke taste. Okay. Take it. I can tell when it's Coke because it hurts.
[2129.54s -> 2145.69s]  Got it? Why does this taste like raspberry? This is raspberry. Is this raspberry flavor?
[2148.26s -> 2162.25s]  What? I don't like that one. I'm done with that one. Give me, let me see the other one, please.
[2163.05s -> 2175.27s]  Yeah. Let me do the other one one more time. This is definitely Coke. Yeah. Of course it is.
[2175.27s -> 2180.78s]  Of course it is. This is the classic Coke flavor. The other one was raspberry. What is it?
[2180.78s -> 2189.08s]  Yeah. That Pepsi is way worse than Coke. Coke is way better. Okay. Well, first of all,
[2189.08s -> 2194.97s]  like this like tastes like it has other flavors in it. Coke kind of hurts when you,
[2195.21s -> 2200.58s]  when you drink Coke, it has that kind of like, it's like a bite, which I like way more than Pepsi.
[2200.58s -> 2213.18s]  Let me just do the, not that I can see it. Let me see. This tastes almost like vanilla,
[2213.18s -> 2224.97s]  like it tastes like there's something else in it. Citric acid. Is there citric acid in Coke?
[2224.97s -> 2232.95s]  Bro, no, there's not. No, that's the difference. It's citric acid. That's the difference.
[2233.91s -> 2240.98s]  There's citric acid in Pepsi and this, this, this phosphoric acid in Coke. That's why it tastes
[2240.98s -> 2248.25s]  like kind of like, it's like a like fruity. Okay. Coke's way better. Coke is like A.
[2249.66s -> 2255.83s]  Pepsi is like, it's not bad. I, I, I, did I put it in F? I gotta hide for a second because I'm gonna
[2255.83s -> 2263.11s]  burp. Everybody probably thought I was about to puke. Everybody's probably like, oh shit,
[2263.11s -> 2266.95s]  he's puking. No, I just wanted to hide because I didn't want to burp into the fucking microphone.
[2268.44s -> 2275.70s]  Pepsi is a C minus. It's not F. It's not fair to call it F. Coke is way better.
[2276.34s -> 2283.83s]  I gotta go down to like fucking puke. All right. There's your sodas. The one that surprised me is
[2283.83s -> 2290.65s]  probably squirt. The first time I've probably ever had it. I move away from the mic to put the Coke
[2290.65s -> 2297.80s]  cap on. Yeah, I got it. These all go in the fridge. I will absolutely drink all the Pepsi. I'll drink
[2297.80s -> 2306.20s]  all the Coke. I'll, this will be used as a sauce. I'll drink all this. I'll, I'll drink all that.
[2306.20s -> 2314.98s]  I'll have to. Okay. Coke is A. Pepsi is C. That's my opinion. I know you probably love Pepsi,
[2314.98s -> 2318.18s]  but it tastes, it's got fruits in it somehow. It tastes like it's got fruits in it. So that's it.
[2318.74s -> 2325.64s]  What's in here? Oh, my green tea powder. Perfect. All right. There's your soda. There's your fruit.
[2326.28s -> 2330.74s]  We're gonna move on. Let's stay in the sugar realm. Why not? Let's move to chocolate.
[2333.50s -> 2341.58s]  This is Almond Joy. These are both, to me, these are both, old people eat these. This is like,
[2341.58s -> 2347.10s]  I imagine an old guy sitting just kind of in a rocking chair. Just like, they're like,
[2347.10s -> 2351.42s]  these are like 19, like 20 or something. These are all old and old people eat these and I don't
[2351.42s -> 2356.34s]  like them. And they're made by this, look, you can tell that the same, the same game company made
[2356.34s -> 2365.13s]  these. This is like an asset flip. It's a, it's a unity flip. It's an asset flip. All right. This
[2365.13s -> 2372.81s]  is Almond Joy. I'm only going to take like one bite of this. Oh, it's like a little sectioned
[2372.81s -> 2382.36s]  off here. Okay. So this is what it looks like. This is what an Almond Joy is. I, I don't think
[2382.36s -> 2389.19s]  I've even ever opened this. Have I ever eaten, I feel like I've eaten this and hated it.
[2390.18s -> 2397.02s]  Why, but why are they, why is there a coconut on it? It's coconut? All right. Here we go. Almond
[2397.02s -> 2415.96s]  Joy. Almond Joy, everybody. Here we go. It's very mushy in the middle. Very mushy. Do you want one?
[2417.80s -> 2434.38s]  She's like, you want the other half of this? Wait, it's definitely not F. It's too, it's like too,
[2434.38s -> 2440.41s]  it's like too mushy. There's like too much fiber in the middle. I know, but coconut is like,
[2441.93s -> 2450.44s]  I like coconut water and coconut milk. Here, take that. Actually, the more that it, the more
[2450.44s -> 2463.19s]  that I'm sitting here, I kind of hate it, but I want another one. Hold on. I'm very texture-based.
[2469.75s -> 2479.35s]  Same reason why the apple Red Delicious, it's like the skin. If I have to sit there and like chew
[2479.35s -> 2486.20s]  your product for more than like two or three straight minutes, I usually don't, because now,
[2486.20s -> 2491.56s]  here's the problem. Okay. Well, gross. Here we go. Here's the problem. Problem. Problem alert.
[2492.74s -> 2500.65s]  All the chocolate is gone. All the almond is gone. The only thing that's left is fibers of coconut,
[2500.65s -> 2517.27s]  just mushed together in my mouth. Still there. Nope. Nope. Sorry. I would treat this the same
[2517.27s -> 2524.25s]  way that I usually treat milk dogs, which by the way, I thought I just dumped them. Coming up soon.
[2525.88s -> 2529.72s]  I make sure you stay to the end of the video for me to tell you which one I like more.
[2530.52s -> 2543.02s]  I'm still showing it. Still showing it. Still there. Oh, it's slowing. It's getting slowly
[2543.02s -> 2552.95s]  down past D. It's just D. It's D. I'm sorry. I'm still showing the fucking coconut fibers.
[2552.95s -> 2559.70s]  I'm enjoying. Honey, I'm sorry. This is D. Oh, it's still there. I was, I don't want to eat this.
[2560.50s -> 2578.23s]  I'm trying to swallow it. I want someone to count how many times I just had chewed that from when
[2578.23s -> 2583.37s]  it went in. That first, okay, when I bit it and it was like the textural, like the mush of the
[2583.37s -> 2589.21s]  coconut, the fibers, the chocolate, the almonds, that was a B. That bite was a B. That was a B plus.
[2590.25s -> 2595.82s]  Then the same problem I have with the fucking red delicious apple, it stays in your mouth forever
[2595.82s -> 2602.36s]  and you just chew up a bunch of fucking paper. That's what it's, it is good value. If you like
[2602.36s -> 2610.44s]  chewing coconut, that was a B plus initial reaction. And then, and then like a D. So I think,
[2610.44s -> 2624.84s]  I don't think it's F. F is kind of unfair. He's muted. No, I'm not. Holly is based. Holly,
[2624.84s -> 2634.38s]  you should get him. It's a skill issue. It's not like Apex. What are you talking about?
[2636.15s -> 2641.11s]  The initial bite was a B. The rest of it was like a D minus. So therefore it has to go into C minus.
[2641.11s -> 2645.74s]  I'll be fair to it. I will be fair to it. It's a C minus. I'm not going to go to the store and buy
[2645.74s -> 2651.38s]  a C minus though. If somebody presented me with an almond joy, I'd go, oh, thanks. In my brain,
[2651.38s -> 2656.58s]  I'd secretly be going, fuck that guy. But I'd be like, thanks. And I would eat it and it'd be all
[2656.58s -> 2662.58s]  right. Almond joy, C minus. It's not an F. Let's stay in the same category. There's mounds now.
[2662.58s -> 2668.78s]  Oh, more coconut from the same asset flip. So what's the difference? What's the difference
[2668.78s -> 2674.47s]  between mounds and coconut? Mounds and almond joy. That's the only difference. It might be
[2674.47s -> 2689.96s]  dark chocolate. Oh wait, the only difference is there's just no almonds in this. What? Oh,
[2689.96s -> 2694.36s]  it is. It really, it just is that. But I liked the almonds in this. This is going to be F.
[2694.92s -> 2702.18s]  All right. This is, this is mounds. Mounds again. It's dark chocolate with no almonds. Oh,
[2702.18s -> 2718.86s]  I don't really like dark chocolate and I didn't like the mushy coconut. Here we go. Okay. You know
[2718.86s -> 2726.07s]  those like chocolate shops? You go in and they have like the, oh, pick like 10, pick a box of 10.
[2726.07s -> 2729.34s]  And they have like the little things where it's like, oh, this one's filled with raspberry goo.
[2729.34s -> 2738.60s]  This one has like fucking peach schnapps in it. That just reminds me of one of those. Hold on.
[2738.60s -> 2753.85s]  This is better. Yeah, it's better. The dark chocolate goes with the coconut way better than
[2753.85s -> 2768.86s]  the yellow one. And I'm not even a dark chocolate fan. Is he wearing pants? Of course not. These
[2768.86s -> 2782.98s]  were both an F. What almond joy a D? Oh, it's already there. Again, same problem. Alert. Red
[2782.98s -> 2793.37s]  alert. Okay. If they just, if it was like coconut flavored juice in the middle, these would be like
[2793.37s -> 2807.18s]  B. If this was like coconut, like smooth coconut flavored, like nougat, this would be like an A.
[2807.26s -> 2813.77s]  Just swallow it. Dude, I can't. You have fucking George Washington teeth. That's why I don't,
[2813.77s -> 2825.94s]  man. It's just, it's coconut. Coconut sucks. Get better at chewing. No, I'm, I'm gonna,
[2825.94s -> 2834.47s]  it's a man sized sandwich here. That first bite was better than this first bite. I put that in D.
[2834.47s -> 2841.78s]  This is going to C. It's not an F. It's like, it's like a C is C. I was about to take another bite.
[2841.78s -> 2849.10s]  Shouldn't that prove something? Chew it less. Okay. How many times do you want me to chew this?
[2849.10s -> 2858.55s]  What, what are they saying? Like how many times should I chew this before swallowing it?
[2858.55s -> 2870.97s]  120. No, all the chew Andes in chat here. How long should I chew this for? 60 times?
[2870.97s -> 2876.62s]  Enough so you can swallow it. 30 times. 30, 30, 30. I'm going to chew this. I'm seeing a lot of like
[2876.62s -> 2916.33s]  20, 30. I'll chew it 30. 27, 20. We'll go for 30. Okay. I can't. I fucking can't. I can't. It's too
[2916.33s -> 2926.70s]  much. This hurts to watch. Why? Because I don't like your favorite shitty candy. It's not shitty.
[2926.70s -> 2930.62s]  I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It's not dentures. I don't have a baby mouth. It eat
[2930.62s -> 2937.29s]  coconut, dude. Coconut is fibrous. Coconut. Yeah, it is for old people. That's what I'm talking
[2937.29s -> 2956.86s]  about. Cause old people just sit there and they go. Yeah, that's why it's for old people. Cause they
[2956.86s -> 2962.36s]  chew the fuck out of it. All right. It's a, it's a C. And that's all I have to say. And I'm not
[2962.36s -> 2966.04s]  saying anymore. And you won't be able to get me to change my opinion. Okay. Chocolate. What else
[2966.04s -> 2978.97s]  we got? Tootsie rolls. Why not? Yeah, they're right here. This dude's so out of touch. Why?
[2978.97s -> 2991.24s]  Cause I'm now, I'm going to be fishing coconut out of my gums for the next hour. Tootsie rolls
[2991.24s -> 2998.73s]  were, were they F or D? I think they were low D or high F. Just a, see nothing here. Not just
[2998.73s -> 3006.25s]  no strings or anything. See, there's nothing here. See? Tootsie roll. Just a regular, just generic
[3006.25s -> 3020.04s]  Tootsie roll. Why did you buy so many? Do you know how hard it is to buy one of these? You don't
[3020.04s -> 3028.82s]  let us tell them. You have to buy a bag that's either this or 30 pounds. They don't make little
[3028.82s -> 3045.16s]  Tootsie rolls. Let me get the coconut in my mouth. This is not man-sized. It doesn't matter. Okay.
[3045.16s -> 3050.95s]  Coconut's gone. Remember, mouthfeel is very important. I'm a very texture-based person.
[3050.95s -> 3085.08s]  It's fun. It's fun to do. Doesn't taste very good. You know why I don't like Tootsie rolls?
[3085.08s -> 3100.34s]  We're doing it out right now. It tastes more like candy than it does chocolate. You know what? Oh,
[3100.34s -> 3105.94s]  the flavor. Yeah. I was told that I did this wrong because there's like the flavored Tootsie rolls
[3105.94s -> 3114.63s]  are better. Not the default ones. This tastes, this doesn't taste like chocolate to me. It tastes
[3114.63s -> 3122.44s]  less like chocolate. Like this is not a chocolate to me. It's just like a candy. This, this was a
[3122.44s -> 3128.90s]  chocolate. This is chocolate flavored candy. And that doesn't make any sense. So that's why I kind
[3128.90s -> 3143.93s]  of don't like it. Midgis? What is a midgi? Is this like, like from what countries did I get these
[3143.93s -> 3159.02s]  from? Midgi? Is that like, is that like Finnish? Is that Finnish for like middle? Midgi. What is that?
[3159.18s -> 3174.09s]  It's mid. It's mid. Is it, what is that? Like is it a different language? Is it Australian?
[3176.20s -> 3190.92s]  Australian is English. It's mid grade. Mid grade. It's not mid. All right. I, we are,
[3193.34s -> 3198.98s]  we are, don't say it's mid grade. I didn't say that. I didn't say that. Tootsie roll,
[3198.98s -> 3202.18s]  Tootsie roll, if you're watching the stream right now, I didn't say mid grade. I,
[3202.18s -> 3213.69s]  hold on. They said that. I didn't say it. It's F. I said it was F, but they're saying mid grade,
[3213.69s -> 3218.41s]  which is not what I said. I said it's F. That means that I don't like them very much.
[3218.41s -> 3230.22s]  That means I actually don't like them. I see the appeal though. I just, I just wouldn't want,
[3230.22s -> 3239.74s]  I just, okay. Look, if they would, these are going to go like this. Yeah. Okay. So this is what's
[3239.74s -> 3244.87s]  going to happen to the Tootsie Rolls. They're going to roll up like this. They're going to go
[3244.87s -> 3253.56s]  into a box and they're going to sit in a closet forever. They don't, they expire in 2024. I'm
[3253.56s -> 3258.54s]  going to go into the closet sometimes. I'm going to go into the pantry sometimes and I'm going to
[3259.10s -> 3266.68s]  look at it a year from now and go, oh yeah, sure. I'll eat one. I'll eat one of these,
[3266.68s -> 3272.89s]  maybe two of these in the next year. Trick or treaters. That's no, no trick or
[3272.89s -> 3278.30s]  treaters don't want little Tootsie Rolls. The trick or treaters want king size Reese's. That's
[3278.30s -> 3286.14s]  what they want. All right. This Tootsie Rolls, they're F. They will be probably eaten eventually.
[3286.14s -> 3292.22s]  No trick or treater wants a Tootsie Roll. Come on. Oh, stay tuned to the end of the video.
[3292.22s -> 3300.18s]  All right. What else? We have a couple of snow caps. I know that we've got somebody here that's
[3300.18s -> 3309.38s]  a big fan of snow caps. I just remember these being like too crunchy. I remember the, I hate
[3309.38s -> 3317.35s]  these. I'm glad I'm solidifying, I'm solidifying a lot of opinions here. The packaging is cool.
[3317.35s -> 3333.88s]  Here we go. Snow cap. The chocolate's kind of, I don't like the chocolate very much.
[3341.54s -> 3351.88s]  I'll probably eat this whole box when I get high next time. They're weird, they're like
[3351.88s -> 3357.78s]  weirdly good, but in a way that I don't want to eat them right now. The texture is good.
[3357.78s -> 3364.42s]  The chocolate's, I don't like the chocolate very much though. This is a flyover state candy.
[3364.42s -> 3386.81s]  They're just chocolate chips covered in, they're just, yeah, they're just chocolate chips covered
[3386.81s -> 3395.51s]  in like a, these weird like, I don't want to say it because it's like mean. I don't want to say
[3395.51s -> 3403.08s]  it because it's mean if I say it. It looks like it's, you know what I'm going to say, right?
[3403.08s -> 3415.80s]  It looks like chocolate chips covered in, no. You want some? Yeah, take whatever you want. Oh,
[3415.80s -> 3421.22s]  you want some snow caps? Oh, my girl loves snow caps. No, I don't know what they taste like. Oh,
[3421.22s -> 3427.99s]  you don't know what they taste like? Here you go. All right, we need your honest opinion.
[3427.99s -> 3439.69s]  Okay, here, eat another one on camera. These people, yeah, you could have eaten anything.
[3439.69s -> 3456.89s]  You could have just eaten anything. Eww. I think it's like, I like the, I like the crunchy texture
[3456.89s -> 3463.05s]  is good, right? I wouldn't buy it. This is movie theater candy. You, but you get this in the movie
[3463.05s -> 3467.80s]  theater and you watch a movie and you eat like half of, you don't, wait, isn't there, hold on a
[3467.80s -> 3473.21s]  second. Don't people sprinkle this into popcorn? That's like the whole thing. You sprinkle this
[3473.21s -> 3486.41s]  into popcorn, right? I could understand that actually. These aren't F. These don't belong in
[3486.41s -> 3489.85s]  F. They're just like, all right, okay, stop, I gotta stop eating them. I've eaten too many.
[3489.85s -> 3508.47s]  The fact that I keep eating them. Damn, I think, hold on. I actually kind of like these. How tall
[3508.47s -> 3521.50s]  is Holly? Six, six, two, six, three. Fuck, these are not F. I gotta stop eating them. I know those
[3521.50s -> 3526.71s]  are good. It took me a minute to understand. It took me, it took me like, I was gonna, I was
[3526.71s -> 3531.62s]  gonna make fun of them. I can make fun of them now, right? Because like, I like it. I like them. So
[3531.62s -> 3538.42s]  like that, these are B. Snowcaps are B, but they look like chocolate with mold on it. They look
[3538.42s -> 3542.10s]  like chocolate with like mold all over it. I can say that because like I, they're telling you I
[3542.10s -> 3555.06s]  enjoy them, but they have, they have an interesting look. Where does it go? Below squirt, B. Are you
[3555.06s -> 3566.94s]  standing right now? Yeah, those are B. Those are, those are very good. Those are very good.
[3566.94s -> 3572.86s]  I want to, you know, get, I gotta get those away from me. I think I'm going to eat another one.
[3572.86s -> 3580.90s]  Take those, take those. I think I'm going to go for another couple of those. Oh, did you,
[3580.90s -> 3588.18s]  did they open? It's like they all dump up. How about that red delicious apple?
[3593.51s -> 3598.86s]  What the fuck, man? Why do apples do this? Why do apples do this? This is like,
[3600.60s -> 3606.34s]  no, this is not from my mouth. Apples are so unappetizing, aren't they? All right,
[3606.34s -> 3608.82s]  that's good. That's fine. I just don't want that to be on camera because I don't want you guys to
[3608.82s -> 3613.05s]  look, you guys are going to be like grossed out. All right, what else we got? Snowcaps. They were
[3613.05s -> 3621.37s]  F. They were F. Another B. So opinions can change, right? Whopper time. So I have a Whopper. Whoppers
[3621.37s -> 3624.65s]  and Milk Duds are in the same category for me. And then these chocolate chip cookie dough bites
[3624.65s -> 3631.91s]  are going to be gross. Whoppers. Another old person candy. Another candy you'd eat if you're
[3631.91s -> 3639.62s]  over the age of like 50. Or if you go to the movie theater and you really just kind of don't
[3639.62s -> 3644.22s]  know what to order. And there's like 10 people in line behind you. So you just go,
[3645.96s -> 3653.43s]  Whoppers, I guess. And then you go, fuck, this is an easy F. I mean, they are. They were F for me
[3653.43s -> 3664.46s]  before. Here we go. Whoppers. It's like a malt, malted kind of chocolate ball, right? Let's see.
[3664.46s -> 3673.40s]  This says be an original. I feel like I'm kind of an original. They've already, look, they're
[3673.40s -> 3693.66s]  already speaking to me. They think I'm original. They think they said it. Like sandy. Kind of sandy.
[3693.66s -> 3711.00s]  Although it dissipates very, very, very quickly. Very. Suck on it first. Let it melt. Hold on.
[3711.56s -> 3741.38s]  Hold on. Oh, wow. That was a good, that was a good tip. Grandpa's passed out with like,
[3741.38s -> 3767.48s]  with his mouth? Uh, no. You're turning green. Jesus. Jesus. Now the sandy part is soft.
[3767.48s -> 3795.53s]  Geez. Oh, one more. One more, one more, one more. That's it. One more. Yeah, these are good. I was
[3795.53s -> 3802.55s]  eating them wrong the whole time, my whole life. I was eating these wrong my entire life. I was
[3802.55s -> 3810.66s]  just eating them and crunching them and going, ugh. You gotta let the flavors happen. You have to let
[3810.66s -> 3819.10s]  the flavors happen. It's a multi-layered candy. See, there's like this nice, it's a nice, it's
[3819.10s -> 3824.17s]  actually a pretty nice like smooth chocolate on the outside. The inside I don't like. But if you let
[3824.17s -> 3837.43s]  sit for a minute. Jesus, these are good. I'm very conflicted right now because these are like really
[3837.43s -> 3861.64s]  good. But are they though? They're kind of a little too buttery at the end. How do I really
[3861.64s -> 3872.44s]  feel? He's a C. He went from F to C. There's a little too buttery at the end. Oh, it's over Cantaloupe
[3872.44s -> 3881.30s]  for sure. Um, it's over Pepsi for sure. Pepsi is above Cantaloupe without a doubt. Wait a minute.
[3881.30s -> 3890.02s]  No, it's not. Cantaloupe is way above Pepsi. Yeah. Stop nitpicking. I mean, this whole stream is I'm
[3890.02s -> 3899.96s]  nitpicking my shitty opinions on my F tier candies. Watch out. Yeah, I'm gonna make sure I don't drop
[3899.96s -> 3906.58s]  any of this. Which I haven't, so that's good. Put that over here. All right, so we have a little,
[3906.58s -> 3912.25s]  we have only a couple more chocolates left. Very cool. I'm not looking forward to this because I
[3912.25s -> 3916.09s]  don't like cashews. I know I don't. Even though, yeah, you put cashews in F. Of course I did.
[3916.09s -> 3920.66s]  They taste, they're like the meat. They taste like meat. They're like the meat of the peanut world.
[3920.66s -> 3928.25s]  I'm not looking forward to doing that. Okay, so here we go. Um, stick that over there for now.
[3928.25s -> 3936.63s]  Right there is fine. All right, so now we got Milk Duds. Milk Duds, the problem I have with these is
[3936.63s -> 3941.19s]  after you put this in your mouth and you chew it up, you wanna, I made the reference two days ago.
[3941.19s -> 3946.65s]  You go watch that. I'll give you, I'll give you a minute. Go watch the VOD from a couple days ago
[3946.65s -> 3953.94s]  and you will see why I don't like these. 30% less? Oh no. Okay, I thought that said 30% less is in
[3953.94s -> 3960.73s]  the container. Like what? What do you mean 30% less? Like that's like something to advertise.
[3961.53s -> 3970.73s]  So if, when you eat a Milk Dud, it gets to a point, a part, a part. Whoa, whoa.
[3972.82s -> 3983.22s]  It gets to a point where they're just kind of chewed up gum and they look awful. Oh, these,
[3983.22s -> 3989.34s]  oh wait, are these supposed to look like this? Are they supposed to be like squished like that?
[3989.34s -> 3994.09s]  Are they not supposed to be like that? I don't think it's supposed to be like this.
[3995.64s -> 3998.62s]  These are crushed. Are these supposed to be like this?
[4001.53s -> 4007.18s]  These look like they've already been chewed. These are, these are supposed to look like that?
[4009.34s -> 4019.02s]  Are you sure? Don't they look like they've already been chewed? This is what they look like?
[4020.94s -> 4040.79s]  Is it? I thought they were supposed to be like circles. These are terrible.
[4040.79s -> 4052.01s]  And I mean absolutely awful. This might be the worst one of the night. These, I have to be fair,
[4052.01s -> 4065.66s]  right? These might be the worst of the night by a long shot. I would rather eat a full bar of mounds
[4065.66s -> 4071.13s]  than eat like another few of these. The texture looks, is kind of, they look off.
[4072.09s -> 4079.50s]  Texture doesn't operate. Do the same thing this time. Do, okay, do the same thing. Okay, okay.
[4079.50s -> 4094.71s]  Hold on. It looks like rat shit. These are huge. Those are like giant, those rats are huge. Oh my
[4094.71s -> 4106.73s]  God. Hold on. That's like a gigantic like sewer rat. It's a, they look kind of bad. These look
[4106.73s -> 4109.13s]  like they were left in the sun or something. All right, I'll do it the way you guys say it.
[4109.13s -> 4130.89s]  Here we go. Again, the old guy had to sit in the chair. Oh, hold on. Ooh, the chocolate is not
[4130.89s -> 4137.37s]  nearly as good as the Whopper chocolate. Not even close. This is more Tootsie Roll chocolate. Not
[4137.37s -> 4149.42s]  even close. It's still bad. Not even close. You know why I didn't want to do that? Because now I
[4149.42s -> 4163.46s]  have the caramel here. No. These are F. Doing that changed my mind. The Whoppers is not going to
[4163.54s -> 4175.40s]  change my mind. It's still bad. It's still F. Who eats these? I feel like it is like a BuzzFeed
[4175.40s -> 4180.84s]  video and I'm from like fucking like Britain or something. Who? No, they don't actually,
[4180.84s -> 4188.04s]  Americans eat these. Oh, fucking bollocks. No, why? Oh, it's disgusting. No, they're actually
[4188.04s -> 4199.10s]  eating these. Yeah, I feel like that's what I'm doing. Oh, the Paper Ruth is right. Okay,
[4209.72s -> 4218.14s]  I actually really don't like these. And we're making a lot of jokes. I mean, we're making a
[4218.14s -> 4222.46s]  ton of jokes, right? I'm trying to be fair because like they've been around for a long time. Who
[4222.46s -> 4228.28s]  makes these? Who actually? They're gluten-free and they're gluten-free. Hershey makes these.
[4229.00s -> 4234.97s]  It's just not good. It's just, I just don't like it. I really just don't. I'm trying to be very
[4234.97s -> 4243.62s]  fair and I just read their F. Oh, that was stuck. Oh, did you see that on camera? Okay, so now we
[4243.62s -> 4252.76s]  got Baby Ruth. What is in a Baby Ruth? Who makes Baby Ruth? Dry roasted peanuts, rich caramel and
[4252.76s -> 4265.26s]  smooth nougat. What is it? I didn't say that. I did not say that this is rat shit. Somebody else
[4265.26s -> 4274.47s]  did and I've read it. Baby Ruth. Here we go. I feel like this is kind of a, it's like a Snickers
[4275.11s -> 4280.54s]  that like went to the gym for like six months. Because like, look at this. This is, this is
[4280.54s -> 4289.98s]  full of, look at that. This is full of peanuts. A big what? Do not say cat shit. Don't say it.
[4290.86s -> 4297.38s]  Did you say it? Did you say cat shit? Oh, I said cat shit. I thought I was like pretending to read
[4297.38s -> 4306.50s]  cat shit. Wait, the gopher? Caddyshack? This looks like this shit in the pool. Oh, it's a Baby Ruth.
[4306.50s -> 4314.42s]  That's okay. It looks, we can't go into this with, this is bias. This looks like a Snickers
[4315.24s -> 4320.49s]  that has way too much stuff in it, but we'll find out. Here we go. Excuse me. I need total
[4320.49s -> 4372.78s]  silence please. I'm just like a dry ass Snickers. It's good. I feel like this has got more,
[4376.12s -> 4380.92s]  another thing is like, oh, if you're hungry, eat a Snickers. Who's eating Snickers when they're
[4380.92s -> 4388.44s]  hungry, right? I feel like this is what that commercial is actually saying. This has way more
[4388.44s -> 4398.89s]  peanuts than Snickers. This feels a little more like filling that, it's got way more peanuts.
[4398.89s -> 4402.66s]  I love Snickers and this just kind of just tastes like, you know what this is? You know
[4402.66s -> 4411.85s]  what this tastes like? This tastes like a homemade Snickers. Like there's like a YouTube video
[4411.85s -> 4417.64s]  showing how to make a Snickers and this is what it is. It's not bad, but it's not, it's not a
[4417.64s -> 4428.15s]  Snickers. That's what I want. I did just say it's a dry ass Snickers. I know. Why, I'm not going to,
[4428.15s -> 4437.16s]  no, you're doing it wrong. You have to, it's an energy bar Snickers. Yeah. All right. It's not an
[4437.16s -> 4452.66s]  F. It's like, I would eat this. I'm going to, I'm going to save this. That's like a C minus.
[4452.66s -> 4466.14s]  That's not a skill issue. It's a C minus. That is, oh, is it, is it above mounds? Oh,
[4466.14s -> 4478.63s]  fuck. This is hard. Mounds is, oh no, it's not. That's hard because they're both like, I feel
[4478.63s -> 4484.09s]  like I would rather eat a baby Ruth, but I feel like mounds tasted better. So I'd say it's below
[4484.09s -> 4491.13s]  amount, below amounts. All right. There's that. Uh, we also, that, we're, oh, we're at the end
[4491.13s -> 4505.56s]  of the chocolate here. We have cookie dough bites. Egg-free recipe. Our dough-licious dough. I can
[4505.56s -> 4511.64s]  always tell how, usually they have like a huge, like five paragraphs of being like cookie, cookie,
[4511.64s -> 4515.08s]  yummy, yummy, dough-licious, right? Like they have like a bunch of like bullshit in the back,
[4515.08s -> 4523.48s]  but they don't. This contains milk, soy, and wheat. It's also packaged in a facility that it has
[4523.48s -> 4530.18s]  peanuts, tree nuts, milk, solids, eggs, wheat, soy. They all, okay. Don't eat, don't eat these.
[4531.06s -> 4542.57s]  Don't, apparently don't eat these. Nobody can eat these. Ooh, look at that. That's actually pretty
[4542.57s -> 4549.38s]  cool. Nope. No other candy with that. No other candy like this came in a bag. That gets points.
[4553.14s -> 4562.07s]  Milk solids. They get points. Don't bat-chest me. That's it. Okay. This is like, I can carry this.
[4562.63s -> 4573.98s]  I don't want to like go. No, that's a, that gets points. Pollution? That was a weird smell. That
[4573.98s -> 4592.57s]  was actually kind of off-putting. I opened that bag and somebody fought it in my face. Cookie bites.
[4592.57s -> 4602.78s]  All right though. But yeah, I mean, come on. Yeah. Not that good though. My initial reaction was like
[4602.78s -> 4617.03s]  cookie dough. I love cookie dough. And then it was like, ooh, no. Yeah. Honestly, like I would just
[4617.03s -> 4625.62s]  rather not have any chocolate on this. They're good, but I feel like, I feel like I just want
[4625.62s -> 4639.40s]  cookie dough. It is a little weird. It's actually kind of good though. Yeah. Nice microplastics
[4639.40s -> 4652.38s]  you're eating. Okay. These are not F. You know where this would, these would actually be amazing?
[4652.38s -> 4669.83s]  Part of a sundae. I'm still eating. We're good. These are, the more I'm eating, the more I like it.
[4669.83s -> 4681.69s]  I picked it up and put it here. It's microplastic Andy. Microplastic Andy. It's a plastic bag. It's
[4681.69s -> 4691.83s]  not microplastics in the food. These are actually pretty good. I could imagine these frozen. Like
[4691.83s -> 4701.50s]  it says, try them frozen. That would be actually, wow. That would be, that'd be way better. It's
[4701.50s -> 4706.89s]  good. It was like, when I opened the bag, it was weird. It was almost like all like the, like the
[4706.89s -> 4714.71s]  smelly gas in here or whatever it is. Like it was just like boom right in my face. It's definitely
[4714.71s -> 4732.28s]  not a B. I don't know. Is it a C though? What's on C right now? Whoppers are better. Are these
[4732.28s -> 4739.24s]  better than a cantaloupe? I feel like that's unfair. Hey, but it's like a, hey, do you like
[4739.24s -> 4747.72s]  cookie dough more than you like cantaloupe? Yeah. Oh, okay. Well, that's not fair. It's,
[4747.72s -> 4760.66s]  cantaloupe's better. Better than Pepsi. Pepsi's better. I would, these could probably go up to
[4760.66s -> 4768.34s]  B in the freezer. Actually not that bad. Actually pretty good. The smell was a little weird. I would
[4768.34s -> 4777.99s]  definitely put this in the freezer and put it on ice cream probably later tonight. He's going to
[4777.99s -> 4785.13s]  get sick. The amount of candy that I'm eating is less than the amount of candy you ate at the last
[4785.13s -> 4790.95s]  Spider-Man movie. Okay. It's less than you ate at Spider-Man. I think that's all the chocolate.
[4793.93s -> 4800.06s]  There's nothing over here. There's nothing over here. All right. Now we're going to move into the
[4800.06s -> 4805.38s]  gross candy. By the way, if you, if you're just joining us and you don't know what's going on,
[4805.38s -> 4812.38s]  I saw somebody said, what the fuck is this shitty tier list? I am, I've taken every item. Well,
[4812.70s -> 4820.89s]  90% of every item that I said was F or high or low D. This is all the things that I've said are F
[4820.89s -> 4825.21s]  and I have to see if I got to go against my own bullshit. We're going to see opinions can change
[4825.21s -> 4833.69s]  in a long time and some of them have. Not for this though. Hot tamales. I don't know why anybody
[4833.69s -> 4845.26s]  eats these and like the fireball whiskey. Dude, fireball whiskey. It's fucking heinous. No, Otto's
[4845.26s -> 4851.98s]  not going to get any of this. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'm being careful. This is what a hot tamale
[4851.98s -> 4863.35s]  looks like. Oh, that smell. It's like a fucking Yankee candle. Yeah. This just smells like a
[4863.35s -> 4867.19s]  candle from Yankee candle. Hot tamale. That's what they are. They're kind of like Mike and Ike's,
[4867.19s -> 4904.33s]  but hot tamale. They're actually not bad. Don't do that. That was kind of enjoyable. That was
[4904.33s -> 4923.37s]  enjoyable. Damn. Really? That was enjoyable, but I don't want another one. I don't know how people,
[4923.37s -> 4929.72s]  okay, dude, please in the chat, tell me like, you're not eating all these. Like you sitting
[4929.72s -> 4937.59s]  there watching TV and just eating a fucking handful of these. No way, right? How many of
[4937.59s -> 4943.66s]  these are you eating? Everyone that's like, dude, hot tamales, bro. Whoa, fire. Like how many are
[4943.66s -> 4954.41s]  you eating? Because I feel like they just chew big bread. I feel like that was an enjoyable
[4954.41s -> 4966.25s]  experience, but I don't want to like eat handfuls of these. Maybe two at a time. These are better
[4966.25s -> 4976.92s]  than the hard candy fireballs, but I still don't really like them. My eyes. It tastes like big red.
[4976.92s -> 4983.99s]  Do I put these in F though? But I mean, I feel like they kind of have to stay in F because I
[4983.99s -> 4993.83s]  don't, I'm not going to eat anymore. Yeah. What's an F? Yeah, cutsy rose, honeydew,
[5003.38s -> 5013.08s]  fucking diet Mountain Dew. Would I rather, but I mean, I don't want to eat this though.
[5013.08s -> 5037.72s]  That was a fine experience, but you catching this? You catching this? Still trying it. Okay.
[5037.72s -> 5056.74s]  It's better than red delicious apple. It is? I said, what? I didn't say F. They're D. They're
[5056.74s -> 5061.46s]  better than an app. They're better than a red delicious apple though. Are they? I don't know.
[5061.46s -> 5067.70s]  It's hard because I would eat a red delicious apple. If somebody, if you were like here,
[5067.70s -> 5071.46s]  this is a red delicious apple. Eat this red delicious apple. I'd be like, okay,
[5071.46s -> 5078.94s]  I don't love it, but like I wouldn't eat more than two of these. Yeah, they're D. I don't,
[5078.94s -> 5088.71s]  I just, they just don't do it for me. Yeah. That's fair. That's fair. I don't, not a fan.
[5089.35s -> 5093.51s]  They are better than the balls though. Like the fire balls. They're better than those
[5093.51s -> 5101.08s]  because you know what? It's one and done. Like this kind of is like a breath mint to me.
[5101.08s -> 5105.64s]  Like, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm got a big meeting. I got to like eat like a hot tamale to get like
[5105.64s -> 5113.43s]  cinnamon burst breath, right? Like to me, that's a breath mint. I'm making sure you stay the whole
[5113.43s -> 5132.79s]  time. Oh, this is staying an F. This is staying an F. Ah, Swedish fish are bad. I can already
[5132.79s -> 5155.37s]  tell by how it feels. Here we go. Do you like Swedish fish? Yeah. They smell like, um, it
[5155.37s -> 5161.40s]  smells like melted candy or something. It smells like you like, you want to try it? It smells
[5161.40s -> 5165.48s]  like kind of like melted candy, right? Like melted. All right. Here we go. I know people
[5165.48s -> 5169.00s]  are pissed about this. Everyone was like, dude, you haven't tried it in like 10 years. Try it.
[5169.00s -> 5173.24s]  You'll like it. That's the whole purpose of the stream is to prove all you guys wrong
[5173.24s -> 5203.21s]  that this is F. Is it, is it an F? But don't say anything to that. I don't know. It smells
[5203.21s -> 5218.50s]  like a swimming pool. I don't know why. These are not Fs. Not even close. But again, the same
[5218.50s -> 5226.74s]  problem. Like I don't, I don't want to eat. This is this bag. I would eat like one of these and be
[5226.74s -> 5232.04s]  like, okay. That was like, I don't know. It's like, I don't want to eat this whole bag. What's the
[5232.04s -> 5240.39s]  serving size? Five pieces is a serving. I don't like, I just don't like, I'd rather have a gummy
[5240.39s -> 5257.88s]  bear. Why would you eat a bag of this? Please. Don't, don't tell them. Don't please. Really?
[5257.88s -> 5263.56s]  Are you trying to tell me that when you buy this little bag of Swedish fish, you're going to eat
[5263.56s -> 5271.14s]  five fish for the recommended doctor thing on the back. And then that's enough. What are you
[5271.14s -> 5278.68s]  talking about? Like you're going to sit there and eat until you don't want it anymore. Who does that?
[5278.68s -> 5285.96s]  Oh, oh hot tamales. Oh yeah, dude. Let me see. 16 pieces per serving. I can't have more than 16.
[5285.96s -> 5296.82s]  16 pieces. I wouldn't want five for these. 16. That's a lot. Yeah. Guess what? Do you know how
[5296.82s -> 5308.47s]  many cookies a serving of Oreos is? Don't look. Yes. What is a serving of Oreos? Yes. Yes. Don't
[5308.47s -> 5318.18s]  look it up. Okay. Yeah. Like two or three or three. All right. All these, all these Andes in here.
[5318.18s -> 5321.38s]  I'm not even, I'm not even going to give you a nickname. I'm going to call you Andy. All these
[5321.38s -> 5329.03s]  Andes in here that pretend like they don't go to the Oreo sleeve and get as many as they can fit
[5329.03s -> 5335.86s]  holding like this comfortably with the glass of milk. Please. Oh, I'm going to take two cookies.
[5335.86s -> 5341.70s]  Nope. You're, excuse me. You're going to fit as many as you can. Oh, that was gross. I just spit
[5341.70s -> 5351.35s]  a little bit up. No, she thought I was puking. No, I'm just talking and being rude and like not
[5351.35s -> 5357.59s]  finishing the food in my mouth. You go like this. It's like one, two, three, four, five seconds,
[5357.59s -> 5372.76s]  five. And then you eat, you know, nobody eats two. I, I never eat two Oreos ever. I usually eat like
[5372.76s -> 5400.23s]  between three and five. Didn't change my mind. Those are better than Tootsie Rolls. What's,
[5400.23s -> 5411.53s]  what's, okay. What is above F and low D? I don't know. Because a red delicious apple is the barrier
[5411.53s -> 5430.10s]  to get to D. Okay. I'd rather eat a red delicious apple than a Swedish fish. I don't, people
[5430.10s -> 5441.82s]  like hate me. That's fine. Is that I'd rather eat a red delicious apple as a candy. But aren't these,
[5441.82s -> 5449.24s]  I just, I would rather have like the Haribo gummy bears. There is a red Haribo gummy bear that's
[5449.24s -> 5458.25s]  better than this. Right. Look, I'm not telling you that how you need to feel. I'm not saying,
[5458.25s -> 5463.83s]  Hey dude, I don't like Swedish fish. So fuck you. Don't clip that. One minute, one minute, one minute,
[5463.83s -> 5466.07s]  one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute,
[5467.94s -> 5473.53s]  I never said that. All I'm saying is that I find them to be off putting. I just don't really like
[5473.53s -> 5477.85s]  them. This is like, I just, I don't, I couldn't eat more than one or two of those. All right,
[5477.85s -> 5490.78s]  let's keep going. Oh right. This is okay. This is going to suck. This is the Bean Boozled game.
[5490.78s -> 5496.70s]  I think I can just pick them out. It should be easy. I said that, okay. I said popcorn jelly
[5496.70s -> 5504.34s]  beans were dog shit and everyone freaked out. You cannot just buy an in one day in 120. Remember
[5504.34s -> 5509.46s]  this is like literally two days ago. We talked about doing this. I couldn't just buy popcorn.
[5509.46s -> 5517.06s]  I couldn't buy popcorn flavor jelly beans anywhere. So the popcorn flavor jelly beans are in here,
[5517.06s -> 5530.73s]  but half of them are rotten egg. This might be a little tricky. There's one right here. Is there
[5530.73s -> 5538.94s]  a way to tell? Like, can I smell it? I don't know. It's either going to be rotten egg or
[5538.94s -> 5544.95s]  buttered popcorn. I couldn't get them anywhere. Somebody said, what's the difference? I want that
[5544.95s -> 5556.58s]  person to be very important for a minute. Cut into it and smell it. Okay. I think I can do with this.
[5568.58s -> 5574.07s]  Huh? Somebody said they had the dog food one and it stayed in their mouth for days.
[5574.71s -> 5584.54s]  This is buttered popcorn. I got it. Okay. Oh, it smells like buttered popcorn. Why? This shit
[5584.54s -> 5589.53s]  was made in a goddamn laboratory. Buttered popcorn. This is accurate. Here we go. Is it,
[5589.53s -> 5603.13s]  or is this a rotten egg? I don't know. I hope, I think it's buttered popcorn. Is it a rotten egg?
[5603.77s -> 5615.98s]  I don't know. I can't, I can't tell. I actually, I can't tell. No, you're good. I don't know. I don't
[5615.98s -> 5625.85s]  know. I don't know. No, I think this is rotten egg. No, it's a buttered popcorn. Why? Who eats this
[5625.85s -> 5638.65s]  shit? Oh my God. This is no, I kind of, I need to know if that was rotten egg. I like, I kind of
[5638.65s -> 5650.76s]  like what I know. My brain is like telling me, Polly's right here and she's like, maybe you
[5650.76s -> 5654.12s]  should cut it first and don't eat it right away. Why? Yeah. Cause like, I'm going to have like
[5654.12s -> 5668.42s]  rotten egg breath. I would know. Somebody said just eat a handful. That'd be so fucked up. You'd
[5668.42s -> 5674.31s]  probably have like, you'd probably have like a fucking like mental breakdown. It's not designed
[5674.31s -> 5697.03s]  for that. Eat a handful. I'm kind of curious. I'm curious. Let's go. It tastes like hamburger meat.
[5697.03s -> 5753.03s]  It tastes like hamburger meat. It tastes like raw hamburger meat. Auto filled in. What did you,
[5753.03s -> 5761.54s]  what did you do? Auto ate a cookie. Okay. Buttered popcorn is F. That honestly tastes like,
[5761.54s -> 5766.18s]  it tastes like raw hamburger meat. I have no idea. What was the, what was the possibilities?
[5766.18s -> 5780.42s]  Cause I know I had like a, it was a, it was like two blues, pink. Oh, what the fuck? What's wrong
[5780.42s -> 5786.79s]  with these people? Why would you make that? Now I know what it is. Band-aid, an old band-aid with
[5786.79s -> 5800.47s]  blood on it. Oh, okay. No, I'm okay. So that was, that was barf, pomegranate, old band-aid,
[5802.31s -> 5808.47s]  rotten egg, liver and onions, toothpaste and berry. It just literally tastes like raw
[5808.47s -> 5829.37s]  hamburger meat. I'm okay. No, I guess it's all gone. We'll do a palate cleanse. I don't know why,
[5829.37s -> 5834.39s]  why people do this. I know it's like, it's like content to do this. And I'm not just talking about
[5834.39s -> 5839.11s]  like streams or YouTube. This is like friend content where everyone goes like, well, what is
[5839.11s -> 5844.84s]  it? And it's like, everyone like runs away and shit. But like, no fucking just like read a book,
[5844.84s -> 5849.66s]  go fucking LARP somewhere. You know what I mean? Go like LARPing. Don't, don't do this.
[5849.66s -> 5856.17s]  But play like fucking N64. All right. Well, the butter popcorn is F and I think it might be really
[5856.17s -> 5865.67s]  low. What, what, what is in F right now? Okay. Swedish, Swedish fish are way better than butter
[5865.67s -> 5870.71s]  popcorn. I know I hate them. My opinion does not change, but I mean, this would be like fun,
[5870.71s -> 5883.03s]  friend content, baby. Worse than Twitzy Roll. There's way worse than a honeydew melon. In fact,
[5883.03s -> 5887.59s]  you know what? I think honeydew, honeydew, I mean, this is like a bunch of other, the candy shit,
[5887.59s -> 5892.97s]  but I mean, of course I would rather eat a honeydew melon than eat a buttered popcorn.
[5892.97s -> 5903.78s]  Don't say it's worse than milk does. But what did this person say? He said, look, man, if your
[5903.78s -> 5907.46s]  perception of the candy is already at F tier, I don't think a half ass taste test is going to
[5907.46s -> 5913.16s]  change the scoring wildly. Tell that to Whoppers. Tell that to Red Delicious Apple. Tell that to
[5913.16s -> 5917.18s]  Baby Ruth. Some of these have changed dramatically. Some of these have actually changed dramatically.
[5921.21s -> 5927.37s]  Whopper was at F and now I put it all the way up to like C and B. Would you rather eat a honeydew
[5927.37s -> 5940.92s]  melon or a bloody bandaid? Well, you know, I'm not so sure. All right, here we go. A lot of people
[5940.92s -> 5956.78s]  have been waiting for Fun Dip. Okay. Fun Dip. I put Fun Dip at F or D because it's been a long time.
[5959.16s -> 5965.02s]  It's been a long time. I just remember being like, and this is the sour kind. So Fun Dip is S and
[5965.10s -> 5978.50s]  that's why this is why I'm doing this. It's all that was available at Walmart. Let's get a stick.
[5978.50s -> 5986.63s]  We're going to do stick only first and I'm going to write that. How the fuck are you supposed to
[5986.63s -> 5992.34s]  open this? You can't bring this to the office. It starts at D, literally starts at D. How are you
[5992.34s -> 5995.62s]  supposed to eat this? How am I going to eat this? How do I do this? How am I supposed to eat this?
[5995.62s -> 6012.18s]  I think it's like, okay, there we go. Yep. Okay. Fun Dip executive. How are you supposed to do this?
[6012.18s -> 6020.62s]  Look, I'm like, I can't even get into this. But okay, here it is. We're going to try this
[6020.62s -> 6041.91s]  by itself. I like the smell. Hmm. Okay. I remember these being a lot chalkier than it is.
[6041.91s -> 6049.34s]  You just keep the stick, man. You don't need anything else. Do they just sell Fun Dip sticks?
[6049.34s -> 6061.98s]  I would rather just eat this. Yeah, this is like very, this is very nice. Bite it. No, don't. All
[6061.98s -> 6068.97s]  right, here we go. We're going to start with the Strawberry Smackerie Dew Dip, then the Watermelon
[6068.97s -> 6081.85s]  Wimmo Dip, and then the Tartastic Mystery Dip. Strawberry Watermelon Mystery. Come on, Gwen.
[6081.85s -> 6093.43s]  Why am I using crochet scissors? Okay, here we go. This is Strawberry Smackerie Dew. You go like
[6093.43s -> 6126.65s]  this, right? I'm doing it right? That's good. Fuck. Fuck. That's good. It is good. It's not too sour
[6126.65s -> 6135.14s]  either. I thought it was going to be like, ooh, Warheads. This is, this is fantastic. And they
[6135.14s -> 6142.25s]  give you three flavors. I'm actually excited. This is, all right. I was wrong. I was wrong. You know
[6142.25s -> 6146.01s]  this is because I was like, oh, like kids eat this. You know what I mean? Like, oh, Fun Dip for kids.
[6146.01s -> 6155.00s]  I'm like, why would I, why would I buy this? The strawberry one. I don't fucking need to open the
[6155.00s -> 6163.56s]  rest of it. Fun Dip Executive. Okay. All right. I think I got, I got a taste for that. And they
[6163.56s -> 6170.66s]  give you two sticks. The value here is actually, it's phenomenal. I'm actually kind of sad. I'm
[6170.66s -> 6173.94s]  not going to be able to eat this all. Wait, hold on. Let's check. The mystery flavor could, wait,
[6173.94s -> 6185.80s]  the mystery flavor could be barf. We don't know. There could be rotten egg. That's incredibly
[6185.80s -> 6190.57s]  enjoyable. I wish I was fucking making this up. I don't, I really don't want to like this. This is
[6190.57s -> 6204.55s]  watermelon. I mean, it's just, it's, it's, it's just phenomenal. It's a perfect amount of sweetness.
[6204.55s -> 6210.87s]  It's a perfect amount of like sugar. I always thought this was like just an absolute sugar bomb.
[6210.87s -> 6220.54s]  That this tastes light. This is, this tastes light to me. Fuck. I thought I hated these. I really
[6220.54s -> 6229.16s]  thought I hated this. It's light. It is just sugar. Mix them together. We're not doing that yet.
[6231.29s -> 6237.59s]  Throw a Band-Aid in here. Imagine like, I don't know. I didn't know what it tastes like with a
[6237.59s -> 6244.25s]  Band-Aid. Okay. Good. What about the mystery? Fuck. I would want to just eat these. Be careful
[6244.25s -> 6258.54s]  with these. Okay. There's nothing here for you. I haven't dropped anything. He's good. Okay. This
[6258.54s -> 6286.31s]  is blue. This is blue. That's the best one yet. That's the best one yet. What? What did they say?
[6286.31s -> 6309.45s]  Pregnancy test? I can't even eat it now. Oh, why'd you do that? This was S. This was S. You,
[6309.45s -> 6314.97s]  I was going to put it in S. And now I'm like, there's a pregnancy test in my mouth. What the
[6315.05s -> 6331.99s]  fuck? Okay. No, don't do that either. Don't do that either. Okay. Very important. Very, I feel
[6331.99s -> 6340.65s]  like I'm going like frost-eyed right here. Okay. Very important. This is, oh, you ruined it. You
[6340.65s -> 6354.90s]  ruined it. It was going to be like A+. All right. Let's mix them. We're going to do strawberry.
[6354.90s -> 6363.37s]  Okay. Here we go. We're going to do, we're going to do not pregnant mixed with pregnant. And then
[6363.37s -> 6383.30s]  we're going to do, um, I don't know, UTI. Oh no. I'm trying to think of other things you piss on.
[6383.30s -> 6388.58s]  I guess, well, you piss, like I'm thinking of pee. Like, yeah, but like pregnancy tests, like,
[6388.58s -> 6393.30s]  okay, what else is a test? It's just candy. It's just candy. It's candy. It's candy. It's candy.
[6395.38s -> 6400.90s]  Why did I say that? I don't know. Cause you said pregnancy test. You said that I was sitting here
[6400.90s -> 6407.22s]  enjoying the mystery flavor of sunny delight. That's not what this is. The mystery flavor of
[6407.22s -> 6413.91s]  fun dip. And I hear pregnancy test and I'm like, okay, well gross. Well, let me one up. You hear
[6413.91s -> 6425.11s]  that. They're all fantastic. This is S. I was thinking of what else, like for the thing like
[6425.11s -> 6441.72s]  these, you notice you don't pee on a COVID test. You don't pee on a COVID test. All right. Let's
[6441.72s -> 6463.67s]  bite the stick. Let's see how it feels. Tastes like marshmallows. Good. I was wrong. I apologize
[6463.67s -> 6468.49s]  profusely. I would keep eating this. I would. In fact, I might, I might actually seal this up.
[6468.49s -> 6478.46s]  That's S. I was wrong. I put it in F and it was wrong. I was completely and totally incorrect.
[6478.46s -> 6487.56s]  Fun dip is S tier. I'm sorry. I apologize. Should I just get it out of the way? Should I get it out
[6487.56s -> 6497.88s]  of the way now? Hey, how are you? Jeremy985 here. Make sure you hit that bell and stay for a while
[6497.88s -> 6503.61s]  to the end of the video. I'm going to check these out. These are your favorite. I said they were F.
[6503.61s -> 6511.32s]  Hey, hit that bell and check it out. Stay tuned. Probably tomorrow. I've never, I felt like I'm
[6511.32s -> 6517.43s]  going to hate those. That's going to be the big reveal. All right. Mike and Ike's. We're actually,
[6518.39s -> 6521.27s]  there's not that much left. We're doing good. How long, how long is the streaming going for?
[6524.62s -> 6531.80s]  Lower left of the OBS window should be like in the very, very lower left. Like the bottom, like,
[6531.80s -> 6541.69s]  like the task manager. Is it not there? Hour and 49. All right. Let's go. I have 30k viewers right
[6541.69s -> 6546.41s]  now. What are you doing here? All right. These are original. I know that like, dude, get the tropical
[6546.41s -> 6551.37s]  ones. Get this, the, the other ones. This is original Mike and Ike, original fruits,
[6551.93s -> 6563.13s]  original fruit flavors. These are the originals. Waiting for Trolli. Yeah. Make sure to hit that
[6564.57s -> 6574.42s]  bell. All right. Which one do I eat first? People were pissed that I didn't like these.
[6574.42s -> 6584.22s]  Remember it was like, dude, you have to eat the Trolli, please. There's a lot of reds in here.
[6584.22s -> 6628.10s]  Red. Okay. I'm going for red. Red. Red. No. Contestant medicine. No. No. You have to,
[6628.10s -> 6633.64s]  it's only fair if you try each one. Yeah, this is, that was bad. It tastes like kind of like,
[6633.64s -> 6641.70s]  it kind of tastes like medicine. Eat the green one. Well, hold on. I got, I'm all right.
[6641.70s -> 6651.18s]  Got orange here. Oh, I'm doing fine. You're gonna, you're gonna have diarrhea. So what?
[6651.18s -> 6674.34s]  Do orange. Way better than red. Way better. That was actually very good. I have to be fair though.
[6674.34s -> 6684.84s]  I'm going to rate these individually and then average the score. Red. F. Orange. B. Orange was
[6684.84s -> 6701.85s]  a B. We have F. We have B. Is yellow. A. We've got an F. We have a B. We have an A. Yellow is A.
[6701.85s -> 6712.76s]  I love that like tart lemon flavor. Oh, hell yeah. Okay. We only got two more. We've got, what are
[6712.76s -> 6720.81s]  they? Oh, red is cherry. That, I thought it was going to be strawberry. Okay. So that might have
[6720.81s -> 6729.22s]  fucked up my brain. This is, this is strawberry. I thought red was strawberry. All right. Let's see.
[6729.22s -> 6745.14s]  Let's see what strawberry. That was A. B. F. What about, what about this one? This tastes like it's
[6745.14s -> 6769.59s]  not good. What? It's a very specific strawberry, like fake flavor, and it's not good. That was
[6769.59s -> 6782.87s]  the worst one. F. Green. Green. You're gonna have to save it here. Green. Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[6782.87s -> 6818.33s]  Eventually gave his lightsaber to Luke. Luke had a blue lightsaber. You fucking lost me. You lost me.
[6818.33s -> 6834.10s]  I thought that was going to be sour apple. I was waiting for green apple and I got lime. I was
[6834.10s -> 6854.30s]  waiting for like a sour tart green apple, like Jolly Rancher flavor. Lime. I'm not going to eat
[6854.30s -> 6887.67s]  them all at once. Oh, no. I don't like it. Actually, it's all right. Oh, that's actually
[6887.67s -> 6901.37s]  kind of good. All right. What we got? A. B. B. A. B. B. F. F. What's that average to? Is that a C?
[6901.37s -> 6908.18s]  A. B. B. F. F. Did he already do the Bean Boozle? Yeah, dude. Rewind. I puked all over the place.
[6908.18s -> 6916.97s]  We had to redo the whole thing. So that's a high, that's a C? Yeah, they're all right. I was probably
[6916.97s -> 6929.75s]  unfair. I'll be really honest. I'd rather eat this than any of those. Like, whoppers were good,
[6929.75s -> 6937.69s]  but like I feel like, no, maybe a below whopper. That was, I was unfair. I said, you know, I said
[6937.69s -> 6943.98s]  they were boring and they actually are not boring. It was like a burst of flavor. I don't know why in
[6943.98s -> 6949.06s]  my brain the flavor profile of these was way more diluted than that, what just was. Did they change
[6949.06s -> 6956.26s]  the recipe? Because that was, that was good. Some of those were really, really good. The lemon one,
[6956.26s -> 6963.54s]  perfect. Orange was nearly good. Yeah, that was good. That was fine. I would eat the rest of these.
[6963.54s -> 6977.13s]  I will. Let's put it in the storage unit over here. All right. It's getting there. Here come dots.
[6977.13s -> 6985.54s]  I don't want to do a handful. I don't want to eat. I'm trying to just do like one or two at a time.
[6985.54s -> 6990.79s]  They taste like colors. Yeah. Dots. Everyone says F. Everybody does, but I have to be fair.
[6992.50s -> 7003.67s]  Oh, okay. What happened? What happened? Tootsie makes these. What happened? What else does Tootsie
[7003.67s -> 7008.52s]  make? Man, I just don't, I don't think I like anything from the Tootsie Roll company. Do I?
[7008.52s -> 7022.20s]  Do I like anything from Tootsie Roll? I love dots. I have not eaten these in 10 fucking years.
[7022.20s -> 7034.17s]  Let's find out. Tootsie Pops. Yeah, but I know Tootsie Pops are good. I feel like Tootsie needs
[7034.17s -> 7043.10s]  more to be good than just be a Tootsie. All right. Here we go. Dots. Sorted fruit flavored gum drops.
[7048.46s -> 7057.24s]  Okay. Give it a try. This is old people. Um, I don't think, I don't think so. I don't know
[7057.24s -> 7063.30s]  very many old people that would eat these. All right. Let's give it a try. What do I get first?
[7063.30s -> 7078.58s]  This is pink it looks like. Oh no. It just smells like, it smells like plastic. Like it doesn't smell
[7078.58s -> 7100.15s]  like candy. This is apocalypse food. Like this is, this is like currency. Like I've been like a
[7100.15s -> 7123.93s]  thousand years and like the apocalypse happens. This is like, this is apocalypse food. God. The
[7123.93s -> 7130.07s]  thing is this is apocalypse food, right? But I feel like these, I feel like this, these will last
[7130.07s -> 7142.15s]  like a hundred years. I mean it's, it's, it's, it is what it is. It is what it is. It's exactly
[7142.15s -> 7147.78s]  you know what, you know what you're getting. You know what it is. It's just like a slimy,
[7147.78s -> 7156.02s]  like waxy F tier candy. Last, this is lasting a very long time though. I could just sit here like
[7156.02s -> 7165.78s]  this and it's okay. That's what I'm saying. This is apocalypse food. Like you could suck on a dot
[7165.78s -> 7170.26s]  like while you're like going out and looking for supplies and shooting at the zombies and shit.
[7170.26s -> 7176.89s]  Like this will last like the four hours. Like let me just say it like this. Go, go, go, go, go,
[7176.89s -> 7185.19s]  you know what I mean? Like everybody like hates these, right? Everybody talks shit about these,
[7185.19s -> 7197.30s]  but I mean these, the only purpose for these is to put on the top of gingerbread houses.
[7197.30s -> 7203.70s]  And then you go like, and then eat like the frosting. I mean it's just a, it's just like
[7203.70s -> 7209.26s]  a gumdrop. Does everything have to be flashy with like sour fun dip with like three flavors
[7209.26s -> 7214.54s]  and one of them's a mystery loot box. I mean it's just, it's just candy. It's just like regular ass
[7214.54s -> 7225.18s]  candy and you can just suck, I mean you suck on for, they last a long time. I think it's okay.
[7226.68s -> 7229.72s]  I mean I'm going to put them in F because I think they belong there, but I mean I don't,
[7232.25s -> 7238.26s]  this is like, this is like an American staple. You know what I mean? Apple pie, McDonald's,
[7238.26s -> 7262.15s]  Dots. Like it's, it's like American old candy. It's a D. It's D. Who sucks on Dots?
[7263.83s -> 7278.66s]  Whoa! Whoa, hold on. Yeah! You're supposed to chew them? I like my way, way better. You're
[7278.66s -> 7304.52s]  supposed to chew them? Yeah, hold on. All right, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on. No. I mean
[7304.60s -> 7313.74s]  it's just these. These are the same except this one texturally is better and I think the flavors
[7313.74s -> 7324.78s]  are better. They're the same exact candy to me. They're like, this one's just better. I mean maybe
[7324.78s -> 7329.26s]  if you don't like the kind of hard outside, this is just a soft outside version of Mike and Ike's.
[7329.26s -> 7338.54s]  I think they're D for me. They're D minus. I'm not spending any more time on Dots. They're better
[7338.54s -> 7341.58s]  than Hot Tamales. Whoa, wait a minute. Yeah, they're better than Hot Tamales. Are they? No,
[7341.58s -> 7351.42s]  they're not. What's, what's in front of that? Yeah, they're worse than Almond Joy, but they're okay.
[7356.01s -> 7364.84s]  All right, everybody's waiting. Everybody's waiting to see what the streamer has to say about Trolley.
[7367.37s -> 7384.57s]  Trolley. Yeah, the Swizzlers too, but those are F. Trolley? I've never had these. I just assumed
[7384.57s -> 7389.54s]  they were F because I don't like gummy worms because gummy worms are for children. Fuck it,
[7389.54s -> 7397.86s]  let's go. I'm doing it right now. I got a lot of shit the other day saying that I would put these
[7397.86s -> 7407.86s]  in F or D. I'm ready. Let's go. I almost dropped it. Here we go. Moment of truth for Trolley.
[7417.06s -> 7435.42s]  I didn't mean to. They don't smell good. They smell very fake. All right, I was told to eat
[7435.42s -> 7455.56s]  the pink and blue one first. Here it is. Here we go. Let me cleanse the palette. Okay, here we go.
[7455.56s -> 7509.18s]  They're good, but they're not S. Don't say that. Green, green and orange coming up. I thought these
[7509.18s -> 7517.59s]  are going to be way more sour, like a Sour Patch Kid. That part is fantastic. Once, once all the,
[7517.59s -> 7538.62s]  all the sand comes off though, I don't know, they become a weird, I don't know. That was an A.
[7538.62s -> 7545.54s]  That was an A minus. That one. And if that's the best, if that's what you're telling me is the best
[7545.54s -> 7571.30s]  trolley, I'm not too excited about the rest. That one's all right. The orange part I don't
[7571.30s -> 7578.46s]  really like that much. The green part is good. Stop chewing them. Stop, don't chew them. I thought
[7578.46s -> 7582.95s]  I was supposed to chew, I thought I was supposed to swallow them. You want me to just like, like a,
[7582.95s -> 7592.39s]  what am I, a bird? Am I a fucking baby bird? Do I look like, do I got a beak? Do I have a beak?
[7592.39s -> 7601.99s]  Okay, that was all right. That was a B. You know, but hold on, here's the thing.
[7601.99s -> 7605.35s]  I thought these were huge. The reason why I didn't ever buy these is because I thought
[7605.35s -> 7611.96s]  they were like these like gross, like, like, like six, seven inch long things. I didn't think they
[7611.96s -> 7625.85s]  were this little. I thought they were like going to be these curly Q like blah. I didn't know they
[7625.85s -> 7636.98s]  were little. Why are you chewing for so long? I'm just chewing the food. Why would I think that?
[7636.98s -> 7643.46s]  Gummy worms are long, aren't they? Red yellow is not good. Okay, well trolley's the best. Get trolley.
[7644.10s -> 7654.78s]  Except only eat one of the colors in there, not the other like 35%. Okay, so we're gonna,
[7654.78s -> 7660.50s]  okay, after I do the candy, we'll probably clean up a little bit. So after I do these next two
[7660.50s -> 7663.51s]  candies, we're gonna clean up. We're gonna move some of the stuff out of the fridge.
[7664.15s -> 7669.30s]  We'll do our chips. I'm very excited about this. I'm gonna piss a lot of you off.
[7669.30s -> 7683.26s]  All right, here we go. That was bad. Yeah, that was way too harsh. It was like a way too acidic
[7683.26s -> 7693.24s]  in the first second. No, I don't, they're all, they're good. That first one was fantastic.
[7693.24s -> 7712.76s]  Trolley, nice try. Nice try. It's a B. Everybody thought it, no, that's not an S. All right,
[7712.76s -> 7718.49s]  the part on the outside. Okay, if this was a stick, if this was a stick and I could suck it and it
[7718.49s -> 7728.22s]  was a stick, I would like it. Why are these even here? Why do I even have these? Apple jacks? Like,
[7728.22s -> 7733.77s]  I'm gonna eat a bowl of cereal right now? No, I'll eat these for breakfast fucking someday.
[7734.41s -> 7740.58s]  Apple jacks are fucking C. I don't even need to eat them. Oh, we got like red too. All right, okay.
[7741.67s -> 7750.66s]  What is um, oh, orange slices. It's cafeteria food.
[7756.52s -> 7761.72s]  I didn't want to buy a box of apple jacks though, man. Like, I'm not gonna buy a whole box.
[7761.72s -> 7770.04s]  These are the orange slices. Do I even really need to eat one of these? I feel like I'm gonna
[7770.04s -> 7786.94s]  fucking hate it. Find out. Orange slices are really good. Yeah, I know, more or less the candy.
[7786.94s -> 7801.77s]  All right, orange slices. Oh, these are awful looking. They're hard. They've got a stiffness
[7801.77s -> 7810.09s]  to them that I cannot describe on camera. It's Walmart brand. Do the, does the brand really
[7810.09s -> 7824.70s]  matter? Does the brand matter for these? They all were made in like 1950. Orange slices. Here we go.
[7824.70s -> 7858.42s]  Oh, this smells like a Christmas decoration. Who's gonna buy this as a gas station? It turns into this,
[7858.42s -> 7868.23s]  what was it? The brand matters. It's great value. What's wrong with great value brand?
[7874.89s -> 7890.95s]  There's an aftertaste here that is very bad. It's a very bad aftertaste. I look sick.
[7892.15s -> 7902.46s]  I'm just sitting here like, they kind of look like slugs. Doesn't the packaging,
[7902.46s -> 7908.26s]  it looks like fucking slugs. Like, larva. All right, the initial bite was fine.
[7908.26s -> 7914.65s]  Uh, after that though. No, these are F. I don't need to take another bite.
[7914.65s -> 7919.26s]  But like, what do I, I could decorate a fucking cake with these or something.
[7919.26s -> 7937.74s]  That's low F. What do we have for uh, for low F? I think these are the very bottom.
[7937.74s -> 7945.98s]  These are below milk dots. These are fucking awful. Those are very bad. Does it really matter? Does
[7945.98s -> 7956.30s]  a brand actually matter? Are you going to clean up? Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's only one more candy.
[7956.30s -> 7969.00s]  And it's Twizzlers. I'll do, I'll take one quick bite. I know you like these, right? I'll try,
[7969.00s -> 7975.46s]  I'm going to try a little bit because I have to do it. I can't, those were very bad. These smell bad
[7975.46s -> 7986.78s]  too. Yes, they do. They smell like a, like a new coat. Like it smells like, it smells like new shoes.
[7987.66s -> 7993.43s]  Why? Why does it smell like a new pair of sneakers? Like a new shoes, like new coat.
[7993.43s -> 8005.58s]  Like what the fuck? It's like, it smells like new clothing. It smells like new clothes.
[8012.41s -> 8034.87s]  Why are you, I'm just saying it smells like new clothing. New car. Yeah. No, F. Oh my god. No,
[8034.87s -> 8045.61s]  that's just bad. They just don't taste good. That's, they're, okay, they're better than the
[8045.61s -> 8066.90s]  orange slices. The only thing to do with Twizzlers is this. It's, it's above, they're F. The peelable
[8066.90s -> 8073.46s]  Twizzlers are better, way better. No, I don't, yeah, they're F. I knew my mind wasn't going to
[8073.46s -> 8083.37s]  change on those at all. Drink the soda? Yeah. I'm not going to ruin a perfectly good Coke.
[8083.37s -> 8090.87s]  Why would it, is that what people are actually saying to do that? Wait, this is a, this is a real
[8090.87s -> 8100.57s]  thing? What? You drink soda out of a Twizzler. Who does this? You're saying it has to be a Coke,
[8100.57s -> 8123.00s]  right? Never doing that again. Never doing that ever again. No, I'm not doing that ever again.
[8123.00s -> 8128.46s]  All right. There you go. There's your candy. I'm going to, I want to clean up a little bit.
[8128.46s -> 8134.97s]  We still have, oh, there's still a decent amount. There's like six or seven more things to do. We
[8134.97s -> 8140.86s]  have the chips, which I'm only going to eat like one chip, so we'll be fine. I'm going to go pee.
[8140.86s -> 8149.61s]  I'm going to go piss out all this like sugar that I just ate. Uh, yeah, we'll go burp. We're good.
[8149.61s -> 8153.53s]  All right. We'll go BRB. I'll be right back. We're going to do chips, clean up a little,
[8153.53s -> 8551.70s]  and we'll keep going. Be right back. Okay. Hello. I am back. He's dead. All right. So,
[8551.70s -> 8564.89s]  all the sugary stuff is gone. I said that Frank's Red Hog was bad. Oh, I got a little spoon here.
[8564.89s -> 8569.88s]  Okay. Well, whatever. All right. So, here's how it's going to work. No, it's fine. It's fine. Oh,
[8569.88s -> 8581.99s]  there's play. Okay. Oh, I'm going to do this last because it'll ruin my palette. Chug it. He thinks
[8581.99s -> 8586.18s]  these chips don't have sugar. Again, if you're joining us and you don't know what's going on,
[8586.18s -> 8590.01s]  people have been joining going, this, what is he doing? This is stupid. This guy sucks.
[8590.01s -> 8598.62s]  Listen. So, over the years, I've made tier lists of food, candies, snacks, sodas, and I got everything
[8598.62s -> 8605.16s]  that I said was F because I am being an asshole and I'm being biased and I'm going to just face
[8605.16s -> 8611.88s]  my own bullshit. Do I actually think sourdough is F? I don't eat this. And we've seen a few
[8611.88s -> 8618.18s]  turnarounds. We've seen a couple of major turnarounds. So, let's go. Uh, let's go with this.
[8620.28s -> 8627.21s]  Here you go. Here you go, internet. Here you go. Takis, internet. Can't wait. Takis. Oh, dude,
[8627.21s -> 8632.33s]  I love Takis. Takis crusted fucking mozzarella sticks. Takis mac and cheese. Oh, dude, imagine
[8632.33s -> 8636.17s]  if you ate a Takis and put a macaroni and cheese on it. Here you go, internet. Here you go. Let's go.
[8642.10s -> 8656.63s]  Takis. I, I, Trader Joe's makes a version of this that is way better. And look, I just picked up one.
[8656.63s -> 8667.53s]  Gotta put it down. I can't go back to work. I have to wash my hands. I ate one. I put one in my mouth.
[8667.53s -> 8681.77s]  Yeah, I knew it. You know what it is? Takis? Let's have one more. I would like these more.
[8684.07s -> 8692.14s]  I can taste the MSG. MSG has a very specific flavor. It's on Doritos. Like these, like it's
[8692.14s -> 8704.60s]  that like Dorito, like umami MSG flavor. I can taste the MSG. Like I know what it tastes like.
[8704.60s -> 8717.05s]  It's that very deep, almost like Dorito like flavor. Um, no, I'll be all right. Do they taste
[8717.05s -> 8726.15s]  good? I mean, they're, they're, I got the stupid ass blue ones too. Um, you're out of your fucking
[8726.15s -> 8739.18s]  mind. MSG is tasty. MSG has that very, like that salty kind of deep like flavor taste. Use chopsticks.
[8739.18s -> 8745.91s]  I don't. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let me be, I gotta be fair. These are extreme,
[8745.91s -> 8760.90s]  by the way. Be careful. These are extreme. No, it's a fucking potato chip. Relax. I don't like,
[8760.90s -> 8765.50s]  I put them in F because you know what? I'm a contrarian dick. And when everybody on the
[8765.50s -> 8769.26s]  internet loves something, I go, well, you see, I'd rather have the ones from Trader Joe's.
[8778.18s -> 8791.66s]  They're a, see, how am I going to shake your hand? They're a high C. They're a C. They're
[8791.66s -> 8799.38s]  okay. It's just like, MSG, I can taste it. I would put them definitely above Red Delicious Apple.
[8805.06s -> 8814.76s]  What, you don't want me to do like the thing where I go like worst hand 2022? What the fuck
[8814.76s -> 8819.14s]  are you talking about? There's not even a category. Did you drink all this? Did you drink that?
[8820.74s -> 8825.46s]  Chat, I know you did. All right. So this is, oh no, I've got talky fingers. Oh, Cheetos, man. Whoa.
[8826.66s -> 8846.23s]  Hold on. Dude, I like, my favorite part about eating a potato chip or a corn chip is feeling
[8846.23s -> 8851.19s]  like you were blocking yourself from having a bloody nose. Oh, I love it. I love like the,
[8851.19s -> 8855.51s]  it's like, oh, I had a bloody nose and I'm running to the bathroom. Like, I love that. It's really
[8855.51s -> 8872.79s]  interesting. Here's the funny spaceship blue ones. What's the difference? What's the difference?
[8872.79s -> 8886.42s]  What's so funny? Blue ones are better. Do they have MSG? They do. All right. So hold on. These
[8886.42s -> 8893.50s]  are blue heat talkies. I put these in F and already, like, I've already, what the fuck, man?
[8893.50s -> 8925.94s]  What are these supposed to taste like? What are these supposed to taste like? This is the same.
[8925.94s -> 8935.29s]  Yeah. These are like, this is, why make them, why make blue ones? You want to try? They taste
[8935.29s -> 8940.07s]  like the same. Is it just like a marketing thing where they're just blue and it's like LOL or
[8940.07s -> 8959.64s]  something? I mean, I, how do you feel? You like these? I didn't think I would. I feel like if I
[8959.64s -> 8962.44s]  say, oh, wow, there's a difference. Everyone's going to be like, read the ingredients. They're
[8962.44s -> 8980.63s]  identical. And I look like an idiot. It's like, it's like, I was fucking drywalling. These are
[8980.63s -> 8986.68s]  white boy spice level. What? Cause I coughed? What are you talking about? What? I like coughed for a
[8986.68s -> 9010.68s]  second. I need you to hold on. Oh wait, thumbnail. Which one's better? Blue or red? Blue or red?
[9010.68s -> 9031.34s]  Which one's better? And, and, and put a bunch of noodles in my mouth. The red ones are like
[9031.34s -> 9036.81s]  more acidic. The blue ones are kind of better, but why are they blue? Just make them fucking green.
[9036.81s -> 9042.74s]  Why? That would be stupid too. Just make them red. Just call them like talkies, like salt and
[9042.74s -> 9050.12s]  pepper or something. I don't know. Hold on a minute guys. I just had a snack. I have to wash
[9050.12s -> 9063.78s]  my fucking whole body. I take a shower. Oh, was somebody, did somebody get into the talkies? Oh
[9063.78s -> 9090.23s]  no, man. Sure. Don't tell anybody. I'm trying to be sneaky about it. All right. So what's next?
[9090.23s -> 9098.02s]  What's next? Oh, okay. Blue is better than red. Uh, but blue, it comes down a half a letter grade
[9098.02s -> 9102.02s]  cause they're blue and I don't like it. It's stupid. It's artificial coloring. Uh, red is
[9102.02s -> 9111.43s]  artificial coloring too. They both see, but put blue, put them at the same. Who cares? Yeah,
[9111.43s -> 9124.57s]  it sounds like it matters. Mom cleaning up after her child. I get blue. I only want to eat blue
[9124.57s -> 9132.28s]  foods. No, you can't see blue food. Yes, I can. Oh dude, Frank's red hot. Let's go. All right.
[9132.84s -> 9137.85s]  The spice, let's just stay with it. So I put those in F, but they're, they're actually not.
[9137.85s -> 9144.38s]  This I have, oh, this is F. I always think this is F. I'm going to end up using this for a fucking
[9144.38s -> 9155.03s]  stew or something, right? Eventually. But do I actually think this is that bad? You're an iPad
[9155.03s -> 9175.67s]  baby. Okay. Here we go. Ooh, what is this? It's not hot. Frank's, the whole thing about Frank's
[9175.67s -> 9183.24s]  red hot is it's heat flavor. It's not like hot, hot. No. If I, if I want to, what's that show
[9183.24s -> 9188.30s]  where the guy's like, Hey, so on Instagram, what's it called? Hot ones. And then it's just like,
[9188.30s -> 9197.30s]  Oh, we got Frank's red hot here. It'd be like, dude. Okay. Here we go. Frank's red hot. How many
[9197.30s -> 9231.00s]  Skullville units? Oh boy. Oh boy. 40. It's all right. It's okay. Where's my ice cream? It's all
[9231.00s -> 9243.78s]  right. It's just that I, I would rather have, you know what? Okay. Buffalo sauce like this,
[9245.62s -> 9251.27s]  it's the default, just buffalo flavor sauce, which is nothing. There's something wrong with it.
[9251.27s -> 9256.41s]  It tastes good. Do you want to try it? Oh, I thought you'd come to try it. I was like,
[9256.41s -> 9264.81s]  Oh boy, here it comes. No, it's not hot at all. Okay. I want blue foods and I want milk.
[9265.37s -> 9275.64s]  It's got a nice flavor. Sriracha is better. Sriracha is a fucking F. I actually like wanted
[9275.64s -> 9284.34s]  to have Sriracha up here, but I was like, I actually hate that and I won't eat it. Um,
[9284.34s -> 9291.13s]  the initial bite of Frank's is why you do it. It's the flavor is there. They get,
[9291.13s -> 9297.29s]  they became famous with having Frank's red hot be the default buffalo flavor on everything.
[9297.29s -> 9302.30s]  And it's, it's, it's good. Actually it's not even that bad. It's really not bad.
[9302.30s -> 9307.90s]  It's just so easy to say the thing that is the default sucks. Oh no, it's not this sauce that
[9307.90s -> 9318.10s]  I found in a fucking antique shop, right? But I think this is, this is C. I think it belongs at C.
[9318.10s -> 9326.65s]  More hot sauces. You want me to do a hot sauce taste test with a Serrano hot sauce, Serrano chili.
[9327.85s -> 9334.84s]  I mean, Tabasco is S. I don't even need to taste it. Tabasco is literally S tier.
[9336.44s -> 9342.17s]  Tapatio, um, not for another day, another day. I'm going to do it because I feel like I'm going to
[9342.17s -> 9347.45s]  have diarrhea later. I don't want it to be like that included. Um, because if I had like, you know,
[9347.45s -> 9351.85s]  15 different candies and like 20 different like snacks, I don't want to like have it coated with
[9351.85s -> 9360.89s]  like a painful sauce. Um, Tabasco sucks. Get out of here. Get out. Tabasco sucks. Get out. Get out.
[9360.89s -> 9371.02s]  Tabasco sucks. Get out. Sriracha is amazing. Your opinion is okay. I just don't like it.
[9371.02s -> 9378.76s]  I would rather have Tabasco. Tabasco green sauce. Oh, if you never had it before, it's perfect.
[9378.76s -> 9386.54s]  All right. That, we know that. Bugles. I mean, it's kind of hard to put a hot sauce above like
[9386.54s -> 9393.21s]  a red delicious apple, right? That doesn't really work that way. Cholula. Tapatio actually I like
[9393.21s -> 9398.46s]  more than Cholula. I could, wait, you want to face the bullshit with other stuff too? We can.
[9398.46s -> 9401.58s]  Oh, I thought there was a grease on it. I thought there was like, I thought I touched it and it was
[9401.58s -> 9408.81s]  like a grease stain. Do you want me to face the bullshit with other stuff? All right. These are
[9408.81s -> 9430.12s]  Bugles. These automatically start at A, B because you can do this. That one's broken. I can't.
[9430.12s -> 9446.57s]  Never mind. Back down to C to start. Okay. All right. That was, I was unfair. Okay. Wow.
[9446.57s -> 9459.48s]  Then what? I gave this F? I gave this F before? Did I put, did I actually put Bugles in F?
[9459.48s -> 9475.27s]  I can't believe it. These are very good. Your fingers are too big? No, they changed the recipe.
[9475.27s -> 9482.81s]  You can't put your fingers in them anymore. Okay. These, I had an idea of what the flavor was of
[9482.81s -> 9488.84s]  Bugles. You know when you have that kind of dream memory of like the tasting a certain way
[9489.40s -> 9493.86s]  and it tastes like that in real life, but it's like a 10 times better version than what you
[9493.86s -> 9502.74s]  remembered because I would, these were like, ew, that gross Bugle flavor. But now that I eat them,
[9502.74s -> 9516.23s]  these are really good. I'm very surprised. These are just Fritos, but lighter and like more delicious.
[9516.23s -> 9530.15s]  Shit, man. This is bad. These were, these are going from F to A. These are really good.
[9530.15s -> 9537.91s]  America's number one finger, finger hat. Let's put that false advertising. False advertising.
[9540.01s -> 9560.04s]  I can't fit my finger in there. False advertising for kids. Adults aren't supposed to care about
[9560.04s -> 9576.44s]  that. That's true. You're right. All right. Coke is an S. Bring it down to A. Oh, fun difference
[9576.44s -> 9589.40s]  is S. Holy shit. Yeah. These are an A. Yep. This is an A. I could eat this whole bag. I could eat
[9589.40s -> 9596.07s]  that whole bag. Bugles. What a surprise. What a twist. What a twist. Oh my God. In the beginning
[9596.07s -> 9602.18s]  of the video, you, you guys have no idea the twist. Like I changed like four F's.
[9602.90s -> 9608.34s]  Keep watching to find out what they are. Chili cheese Fritos.
[9610.52s -> 9617.10s]  I know. These are dog shit. And they have Bugle, they have Bugleberries in the title.
[9620.92s -> 9631.34s]  Okay. Chili cheese Fritos. It's not that chili cheese Fritos taste bad. They're just too intense.
[9631.34s -> 9638.02s]  They're just like too much. Fritos are fine, but it's just like, it's like too. Remember when they
[9638.02s -> 9641.86s]  did the like ketchup and mustard fucking potato chips. It's just like, that's, I don't want that.
[9641.86s -> 9648.87s]  It's like too much weird shit on it. Oh my God. These are F. F. F. Oh my God. These are bad.
[9649.59s -> 9661.59s]  These are fucking terrible. No way. It's like barbecue mixed with like chili. I don't know.
[9662.31s -> 9686.65s]  These are bad. It's just like way too intense and deep. It's just too much. Hold on. Hold on. Hold
[9686.65s -> 9704.52s]  on. Hold on. You know, sometimes you just get one that has way too much powder on it and you,
[9704.52s -> 9711.08s]  and it just tastes like a fucking bowl of chili for like a quarter of a second. And I don't like
[9711.08s -> 9763.75s]  it. You didn't shake the bag first. Oh, I missed. They're uh, I don't like them, but I keep eating
[9763.75s -> 9768.79s]  them. They're like a C. They're not F. They're just like too much. It's just too intense.
[9768.79s -> 9774.20s]  Too many different flavors. Just too many flavors. There's just too many flavors and too much dust.
[9777.62s -> 9782.33s]  You got to hear the crunch. Oh yeah. You're right. Crunch test. Crunch test. Crunch test. You're
[9782.33s -> 9788.79s]  right. Crunch test. I'm going to say eat the one on the ground. Was that the one from the ground?
[9788.79s -> 9815.22s]  No. Um, this is C. C. All right. Washing hands. Christy, also keep in mind, anything that is D plus
[9815.22s -> 9820.86s]  or higher, I'm going to eat the whole bag. So like these chili cheese fritos, they're going to get
[9820.86s -> 9825.66s]  rolled up and I'll eat the whole thing. I'll eat the whole thing. I know that she'll have some too.
[9826.86s -> 9838.74s]  Okay. Uh, what do we got? Oh, kettle cooked sea salt and uh, salt and vinegar chips.
[9842.81s -> 9850.01s]  Farm to smiles. Farm potatoes. Real potatoes. Real farmers. Delicious chips.
[9851.22s -> 9859.35s]  Carefully crafted for you. Shake the bag. Oh yeah. This, everyone had talked a lot of shit.
[9859.99s -> 9865.66s]  These are God tier to a lot of you. S tier. God tier. I think that salt and vinegar chips are
[9865.66s -> 9870.14s]  gross. I haven't eaten them in five years, at least. But I'm going to do it for you right now
[9870.14s -> 9874.25s]  and you're going to get a library action. And make sure you stay tuned to find out what I felt
[9874.25s -> 9887.03s]  about the trolleys. They smell pretty good. You want some? So you, you really like these.
[9887.03s -> 9894.49s]  Oh, you haven't, have you ever had them? Have you ever had salt and vinegar chips? All right, here
[9894.49s -> 9917.18s]  we go. They just taste like chips. That's something wrong with them. Like, yeah, I mean, but it tastes
[9917.18s -> 9928.78s]  like, it tastes like chips where there's something wrong with them. I would rather just have them be
[9928.78s -> 9948.04s]  salt. Are they F though? I feel that's maybe not fair. I have a pregnant palate. Excuse me?
[9948.04s -> 9955.91s]  Oh. Oh, how do you figure I have a pregnant palate? What do you mean? I'm not eating like
[9955.91s -> 9967.05s]  ice cream and hot dogs. What are you talking about? They're D. These are D. I just, I would
[9967.05s -> 9978.74s]  rather than just be sea salt. Yeah. I want these to be sea salt. They just put a bunch of like
[9978.74s -> 9990.84s]  sour stuff all over them. They're D. They leveled up from F, but no, not into it. The bugles though.
[9990.84s -> 9998.44s]  Holy shit. I want to eat more of those. All right, here we go. A couple of years ago,
[9999.14s -> 10012.94s]  what I'm enjoying. A couple of years ago, I put sun chips in F and I literally lost like
[10012.94s -> 10020.97s]  5,000 subs in a day. I lost 20,000 followers. I lost a thousand subs over the course of like
[10020.97s -> 10027.00s]  every day because people said that it's insane that you put those there. People said it's crazy
[10027.00s -> 10033.19s]  that you don't like these. And even my girlfriend is like, I don't understand that. They're just
[10033.19s -> 10040.07s]  plain. It's like a corn chip, but like I was plain. It's just too plain. They're way too
[10040.07s -> 10045.70s]  plain for me. Way too plain. Yeah, but there's a middle ground. There's like a way too much.
[10045.70s -> 10050.42s]  And then there's like bland nothing flavor. You got to have the perfect amount of spice.
[10051.35s -> 10055.98s]  These, I don't know. We'll see because I put those there too. Those are in F. They're just,
[10055.98s -> 10060.92s]  they kind of just taste like nothing. They're just a kind of weird like grain. But again,
[10061.64s -> 10070.46s]  I have not had a sun chip in at least five, at least five years. First of all, the bag is wicked
[10070.46s -> 10087.61s]  loud. You're going to wake up your roommate in college, bro. Boring ass bullshit. No, yeah.
[10087.61s -> 10093.67s]  Bugles are better. No, these are, these are fucking, why are you like these? These are just
[10093.67s -> 10105.37s]  better. These are way better. These are better in every way. They're like 100% whole grain.
[10108.49s -> 10122.31s]  It's 100% whole grain. But like, this is just like the corn flakes of chips. I mean in a bag
[10122.31s -> 10135.94s]  of corn flakes. 100% whole grain, heart healthy. No artificial flavors are preservatives. And 30%
[10135.94s -> 10142.42s]  less fat than regular potato chips. You know what else has 30% less fat than regular potato chips?
[10142.42s -> 10154.28s]  Baked lays. Which baked lays are S tier. Baked lays are omega S tier. This is cope and seething.
[10158.22s -> 10163.11s]  The garden veggie. I mean these were very highly rated too. I'm telling you, I'm not,
[10163.11s -> 10168.33s]  I'm just giving my real opinion. Are these F? Am I going to piss everybody off by actually eating
[10168.33s -> 10177.24s]  these and saying they're F on camera? How do you get the raw, these are, these are just like
[10177.88s -> 10187.80s]  sun chip original flavor. I want garden salsa. I want garden salsa. No, this is, this is,
[10187.80s -> 10209.27s]  this is it. I don't want another one. F. Not into it. All right. French onion. These were very
[10209.27s -> 10239.93s]  highly rated. Incredibly highly rated. Smells much better. This is French onion garden grain.
[10239.93s -> 10255.99s]  All right. 10 times better. I would say a hundred times better. Remember 2,000 people left.
[10255.99s -> 10267.30s]  Yeah. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy your fucking like bland ass chips. These are actually pretty good. These
[10267.30s -> 10274.09s]  are really good. That's what I mean. You gotta give me something. I don't want to just eat like
[10274.09s -> 10288.12s]  fucking corn. Is it S? What were these A? Ingredients. Demented yellow, de-germed yellow corn meal.
[10288.12s -> 10297.61s]  Yeah. These suck. They don't. These are better. This is, let me show you on camera. These are made
[10297.61s -> 10302.41s]  from the same material. These are made from the same material. This one was made by From Software.
[10302.41s -> 10310.68s]  This one was made by, what's a game company that everybody hates? This one was made, can I say,
[10310.76s -> 10320.60s]  but I better be careful. This one, this one was made by, I was gonna say, what's like a,
[10322.81s -> 10332.31s]  I don't know, this one was made by Blizzard, Ubisoft. No, Capcom makes good games. I didn't
[10332.31s -> 10336.79s]  really like Watch Dogs Legion, so I'm gonna say Ubisoft. I didn't, that game was not very good.
[10337.67s -> 10341.11s]  This one was made by From Software. This one was made by a game company that you don't like,
[10341.11s -> 10351.29s]  whatever that is. The same material. These are good. Why am I so afraid to say that when I like
[10351.29s -> 10360.65s]  yell about these, how much I don't like some of these games? They, this does it right. Not a whole
[10360.65s -> 10369.26s]  lot of sweetness. Not a whole lot of spice. Not a whole lot of salt. This is a B. These are B. These
[10369.26s -> 10379.50s]  are actually good. These are very good. I was wrong. Yeah. These are B. You're weak. Nobody likes
[10379.50s -> 10385.98s]  plain chips, but as I'm saying, like these are, it's just plain. I don't want to eat those. I
[10385.98s -> 10393.34s]  actually don't want to eat these. I would rather eat one of Otto's Milk Bones than one of these.
[10393.34s -> 10406.15s]  These are pork rinds, but what if I'm a, what if I'm full of shit? I'm, I could be full of
[10406.15s -> 10409.75s]  shit. Am I full of shit though? I have, I feel like I just pretend like I don't like these. That's the
[10409.75s -> 10420.65s]  whole point of the stream. The whole point of this show, this television show. Hmm? They're just like
[10420.65s -> 10431.80s]  pork skin, pork rinds. Right, right. I put these at F. Dermot, you're a bad streamer. I was gonna give
[10431.80s -> 10449.53s]  you the finger, but I'm gonna be the bigger man. Hot sauce? On these? Yeah, grab it. I can't even
[10449.53s -> 10474.98s]  open them. I proved him right. What do you mean? Okay. I don't, don't come over here.
[10477.78s -> 10485.16s]  Just don't, I'm telling you, you don't want to be here. No, I didn't fart. No, I didn't.
[10491.77s -> 10516.71s]  I'm just going to get a little one. That's a huge one. Pork rinds. Why? It's, it's fucking,
[10516.71s -> 10530.22s]  it's probably delicious. Why am I acting like there's a bug in my hand? This is bacon. It's
[10530.22s -> 10541.85s]  just like literally like bacon. It's just bacon chips. Very dry. Let's try it with the good old
[10541.85s -> 10570.70s]  Tapatio. They smelled awful. And I mean like really bad. Are you saying what, like a drop or two?
[10570.70s -> 10586.63s]  Hmm. Hmm. I mean, the smell is truly awful. Like it smells, out of everything we've opened today,
[10586.63s -> 10596.68s]  by far this stinks. I don't know why it came out. It sounds so weird, but it's really not good.
[10596.68s -> 10602.66s]  They're very dry. Yeah, they're very dry, but a little bit of the Tapatio. It was like just
[10602.66s -> 10612.71s]  kind of bacon. That was, that was kind of good. One more, one more, one more. I don't, I like,
[10612.71s -> 10622.22s]  don't like it, but it's like, I don't know. I kind of, I could see this being really good.
[10622.22s -> 10633.46s]  I don't know. Maybe like crushed up. The smell will go away. Holly, we're going to be sleeping
[10633.46s -> 10642.62s]  in different rooms tonight. That's good. That's good. I'm not going, I can't lie to you and be
[10642.62s -> 10651.14s]  like, oh pork rinds. I fucking hate being on camera. They're definitely not F, but they're
[10651.14s -> 10654.86s]  definitely not higher than like a D plus. Maybe like a C minus or something. What's the, what's
[10654.86s -> 10666.94s]  the height? What's the highest thing in D? Salt and vinegar chips better than that. Where's red
[10666.94s -> 10690.62s]  delicious apple? Right in the middle. Almond Joy. I'd rather have an Almond Joy. All right. Here we
[10690.62s -> 10699.32s]  go. It's hard. I mean, it's hard to do hot sauce. I mean, this is better than Frank's. But you know,
[10699.32s -> 10706.49s]  Tapatio, you want a good little bit of spice on your, on your whatever it is. This is the,
[10706.49s -> 10711.75s]  this is the best stuff you want. You want to face the bullshit. I will face the bullshit. This and
[10711.75s -> 10719.72s]  Tabasco are the best hot sauces you can buy at the grocery store. Tapatio. Trust me. You're going to
[10719.72s -> 10733.18s]  want it. Hey, Tapatio. Good till it's gone. Actually, you know what? Let's go. I love this
[10733.18s -> 10738.74s]  stuff. It's so good on tacos. It's so good. But you can go to everything. Hey, hey, hey, hey. So,
[10738.74s -> 10748.09s]  it's so good. I put it on my ice cream. You know what I mean? It's very good. It's just,
[10748.09s -> 10759.14s]  it's just vinegar. No, it's not. That was not based. Okay. So we're, we're almost done. We've
[10759.14s -> 10769.30s]  got cashews and bread. If I would, if I got a blood test right now, they would probably think
[10769.30s -> 10775.08s]  I was from like an alien planet. What's going on with your levels? They're all fucked up. What
[10775.08s -> 10783.26s]  did you do? Ooh, that was a, did you see the freshness? Did you get a look at that freshness?
[10783.26s -> 10792.54s]  That was fresh, but they're cashews. So they're disgusting. I fucking hate these. I actually hate
[10792.54s -> 10798.22s]  cashews. I think they're the worst. They're just like meaty, like too like, they're just like,
[10798.22s -> 10806.81s]  it's just like, it's like gamey. It's like cashews are like the venison of the peanut world. There's
[10806.81s -> 10832.02s]  like two, there's too much. Here we go. Oh my God. I was so wrong. Wait, I just, I don't like,
[10832.02s -> 10852.34s]  I just don't like them. I just don't like them. I don't like the shape either. Telling you.
[10852.34s -> 10857.21s]  Eat these instead. It's the same shit. This is made out of cornmeal. This is made out of fucking
[10857.21s -> 10863.37s]  gross nuts. No, I mean, they're different. These are made out of completely, this is way better.
[10863.37s -> 10871.61s]  That's D minus. What's, what's at the bottom of D? Okay. Would I rather have cashews or red
[10871.61s -> 10882.44s]  delicious, red delicious? I would rather eat five red delicious apples before I had 10 of those.
[10882.44s -> 10888.68s]  I know I'm crazy. No, I don't like this. The flavors just doesn't, it's just not good.
[10888.68s -> 10908.79s]  This is not good. Okay. That's all the snacks. It is time for bread. We're going to start with
[10908.79s -> 10916.57s]  butter bread. I never had it. People said, dude, you're fucking crazy. I'm just going to try a
[10916.57s -> 10923.62s]  little bit. Um, no, this is fine. I'm just going to take a little bit. I have whole wheat bread here.
[10923.62s -> 10933.30s]  Gross. And I have sourdough here. Even grosser. Butter bread. I'm not going to eat a shitload of
[10933.30s -> 10941.10s]  it. I'm just going to have like a little piece. Dude, the zip ties are the USB sticks of the food
[10941.10s -> 10945.82s]  world. I, you, I don't, you know, I'm never going the right way. Like I can never get it right the
[10945.82s -> 10956.18s]  first way. Wrong brand. What are you talking about? It's just freaking default bread. Wrong
[10956.18s -> 10971.54s]  brand, Andy. All right. I finally get it off. Okay. This is butter bread. Wrong brand. Here is a
[10971.54s -> 10975.46s]  piece of butter bread. I've done, I've never eaten this and I was like, I don't want it. It sounds
[10975.46s -> 10993.56s]  gross. Enjoy the glucose. You idiot. Thanks doc. Butter bread. Why'd you take the third slice?
[10993.56s -> 11001.61s]  I don't know. No, we're doing this default. I'm not going to play into your horse shit.
[11001.61s -> 11005.29s]  No, what you do, you didn't dip it in, in like butter, put it in the toaster oven,
[11005.29s -> 11009.13s]  let it sit for an hour, cut it in half, put a little bit of sugar on it. No, no, no, no, no,
[11009.13s -> 11012.49s]  no, no, no. We're eating this as it is. You're not going to, you're not going to do any bullshit on
[11012.49s -> 11042.20s]  me. Here we go. Butter bread. Sweet. It's sweet. Sugary. It's like a nice sweetness. It does kind
[11042.20s -> 11049.10s]  of taste like, like a little buttery. This is really good sandwich bread. Yeah. Like I could see
[11049.10s -> 11054.70s]  like, like a big, like a nice slab of ham on there. Nice slab of fucking Swiss cheese. Nice slab of
[11054.70s -> 11064.68s]  fucking mustard. Oh yeah. I could see it. A nice like ham sandwich with this. I think it'd be pretty
[11064.68s -> 11076.90s]  good. This is like, this is high. It's kind of like just like a better version of white bread.
[11076.90s -> 11088.79s]  What is this? What is this stuff? What is this? What is this? How do they get it to taste like
[11088.79s -> 11097.02s]  this? Is it just butter? A slab of mustard? Yeah. I think this is like, this is like a B.
[11097.02s -> 11105.67s]  This isn't, you don't even need to put butter on this. I'm telling you. Put this in the toast
[11105.67s -> 11109.98s]  oven. Light toast. Don't even put butter on it. I think it's fine. You don't even need it.
[11113.69s -> 11124.22s]  I'm just, that's a solid B. Nobody can have this. It's mine. Nobody can have any of this.
[11124.22s -> 11133.54s]  All right. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think? Like, hey, how do you do it? Fold it over,
[11133.54s -> 11145.37s]  set it down. That's how I do it. It's glucose. Glucose Andy. All right. I know I'm not going to
[11145.37s -> 11151.62s]  like this, but whatever. This is whole wheat bread. I got the wrong brand. Sorry. I didn't
[11151.62s -> 11160.07s]  get your like craft beer bread brand. I had literally like less than 24 hours to get all this.
[11160.07s -> 11166.20s]  Dude, you didn't, you didn't get like the, the craft, like micro brew beer, whatever. It's,
[11166.20s -> 11174.31s]  it's bread. This is a hundred percent whole wheat and it's going to be enough. Let's take a look at
[11174.31s -> 11189.37s]  the cola. Pretty nice. Pretty nice marbling. Color is there. That's definitely wheat bread.
[11189.37s -> 11202.18s]  IPA millennial bread. Yeah. It's definitely wheat. It's whole wheat. It's definitely is.
[11202.18s -> 11214.25s]  Let's hold on. Let's. Yep. Okay. The aroma that comes out. There we go. I already know what this
[11214.25s -> 11241.19s]  is going to taste like and I don't like it. It's communion bread. It's just bread, dude. Why are
[11241.19s -> 11247.54s]  you eating it like this? That's the worst sourdough I've ever seen. This is not sourdough. We haven't
[11247.54s -> 11255.27s]  even opened the sourdough yet. This is not sourdough. It's just bread. Who, yeah, who gives a shit about
[11255.27s -> 11260.57s]  any of this? Who gives a shit about any of what you're watching? Who gives a shit about this?
[11260.57s -> 11269.32s]  Oh, a white bread is better than wheat bread is better than sourdough. Who cares? But this is bad.
[11270.76s -> 11278.66s]  F. I just bit my lip. It's F. It's just F. I whole wheat bread just is so plain. Is it? Okay.
[11280.18s -> 11286.52s]  These are the same. These are the same in my brain. It's so plain. It's plain and just like
[11287.80s -> 11293.78s]  cardboardy. These are the same. I don't like whole wheat bread. I don't like whole wheat chips, whole
[11293.78s -> 11299.54s]  grain. No, give me some flavoring. Get that goddamn fucking fucked up B to come over and sprinkle
[11299.54s -> 11307.24s]  the honey on my Cheerios. Like, I need something. It can't just be plain. Here's the sourdough.
[11307.24s -> 11317.26s]  And this is, this is, this is Grandma's, Grandma Sycamore's homemade bread. You better be fucking
[11317.26s -> 11329.75s]  nice to Grandma, all right? Or I better be. Dude, Grandma Sycamore's sourdough. It was the wrong
[11329.75s -> 11349.99s]  brand. There's no right brands of bread. Grandma, Grandma Sycamore. This is Grandma baked every
[11349.99s -> 11364.28s]  single one of these. Don't you get it? Sourdough. That's definitely sourdough. That is definitely
[11364.28s -> 11374.65s]  sourdough. All right. This is the last thing I'm eating. This is the last one. She's looking over
[11374.65s -> 11390.04s]  here. She loves this shit. She's a huge fan of Grandma Sycamore. I know it's not like the, dude,
[11390.04s -> 11402.39s]  doesn't have like the Swiss cheese holes. It's, I had fucking 24 hours. Yeah, that's all right.
[11403.66s -> 11411.02s]  It's just like, it's just bugs all over it. It's fine. All right, here we go. Sourdough sandwich
[11411.02s -> 11419.69s]  bread from Grandma Sycamore. Actually pretty, the thing I fucking hate about sourdough is it's like
[11419.69s -> 11447.67s]  made out of glue. Go to the bakery and buy, yeah, all right, Bakery Andy. Hey, Grandma, you got a
[11447.67s -> 11458.86s]  good thing here. It's good. It's not like that super heavy like sourdough, like, like sour flavor.
[11458.86s -> 11475.74s]  It's good. It's good. Grandma, am I wrong? You gave it to, somebody said I gave it to you like
[11475.74s -> 11481.88s]  I was feeding a duck. Grandma went fucking sycamore mode for this because I don't really like sourdough
[11481.88s -> 11489.96s]  and this is, this is pretty good. This would like a say, like it's got like that, it's light. Who
[11489.96s -> 11505.58s]  made this? Grandma Sycamore homemade bread. Hold on a minute. Grandma Sycamore's homemade bread has a
[11505.58s -> 11514.70s]  fresh baked homestyle taste and texture your family will love. True. Our breads are made without
[11514.70s -> 11520.30s]  artificial preservatives, colors, or high fructose corn syrup. Just ingredients you can trust.
[11520.30s -> 11525.99s]  Actually you can trust Grandma Sycamore mode. Give our breads a try and you'll see why we believe
[11525.99s -> 11536.25s]  that nothing compares to Grandma Sycamore's. It has that like sour sourdough flavor but it's not
[11536.25s -> 11542.07s]  like fucking tough as goddamn nails. That's why I don't like sourdough. You're holding the bread
[11542.07s -> 11552.98s]  like a baby? I was reading this. All right, Grandma Sycamore. Grandma Sycamore. All right,
[11552.98s -> 11559.82s]  stop saying that. Grandma Sycamore, that's a, all right, I'm biased because I don't like sourdough.
[11559.82s -> 11566.18s]  So remember, like a C plus for me for sourdough might be like a B or an A for you but I'm not a
[11566.18s -> 11573.66s]  big fan of sourdough but Grandma Sycamore didn't miss. That's a C plus. I actually, I actually did
[11573.66s -> 11579.59s]  not, I will probably have a sandwich for this later. That's, okay, you know what I'm talking
[11579.59s -> 11588.87s]  about? Like that sourdough flavor is there but not like the chewy sourdough toughness. Grandma,
[11588.87s -> 11613.59s]  pretty good, pretty good. Oh, let me see. Undip, Coke, yep, 7% battery power. All right, Red Hot
[11613.59s -> 11619.24s]  is not rated but Red Hot like doesn't, I don't know, doesn't need to be. All right, I think,
[11619.24s -> 11626.46s]  what, what stayed an F? It looks like Sun Chips stayed an F, Swedish Fish, Wheat Bread, Tootsie
[11626.46s -> 11636.73s]  Rolls, the Honeydew Melon, yeah, yeah. I thought that was an avocado. Jelly Beans, yeah, the
[11637.29s -> 11641.05s]  Butter Jelly Beans are gross. Grapefruit is still gonna stay down. The Mountain Dew is down there,
[11641.69s -> 11649.96s]  this makes sense to me. Surprises though, we have a few surprises. Bugles, Big Twist, I really,
[11649.96s -> 11654.36s]  I thought I hated those. Those were all the way up to A. Fun Dip, I thought was like a disgusting
[11654.36s -> 11661.59s]  thing for children. In fact, adults can enjoy it too but you can't bring that to the office.
[11661.59s -> 11672.49s]  Fun Dip is at S. Bugles went up to A. Yeah, these were, these were good, the Sun Chips. I would
[11672.49s -> 11685.69s]  definitely put the bread, put the Sun Chips above the bread and then put the Green Sun Chips. I
[11685.69s -> 11692.84s]  think this is good. Fritos. Whoppers went up too. Whoppers went up from F. I'm actually pretty,
[11692.84s -> 11700.26s]  I'm pretty surprised by some of this. Mike and Ike said, those were F too. No, Butter, put
[11700.26s -> 11706.58s]  Butter Bread at C. Definitely put Butter Bread behind Grandma because I mean, there's no way that's
[11706.58s -> 11721.42s]  better. Yeah, I knew that I still wasn't gonna like Swedish Fish or Tootsie Rolls. You're an iPad kid.
[11721.42s -> 11727.35s]  Well, there, there you have it. There, you wanna get, you wanna come grab your phone? There you go.
[11727.35s -> 11734.42s]  Hold it that way. Okay, all right. No, Otto. Otto's just been chilling here the whole time.
[11735.13s -> 11740.57s]  He's just, he's like, I'm eating like bread and stuff and he's just like, like, no, you're not
[11740.57s -> 11747.64s]  getting any of this. What about the Frank's Red Hot? I mean, that's, I, it's hard. You can't like
[11747.64s -> 11755.80s]  put, it's hard to put hot sauce here. That has to be a whole another day. Okay, so in the chat,
[11755.80s -> 11761.50s]  on a scale of one to 10, 10 being, this was a really fun stream. You should do it again.
[11761.50s -> 11766.36s]  And one being, I accidentally clicked on your stream and I'm never coming back. What, where was,
[11766.36s -> 11769.75s]  how do you feel about this? Do you want to see more of this? Would you like to see more of these
[11769.75s -> 11782.68s]  kind of weird taste test streams? Okay. Seen a lot of eights, a lot of sevens, a lot of nines.
[11782.68s -> 11793.93s]  Seen some tens. Seen some tens. Nine, three. Oh, cool. All right. Well, I'm gonna clean up.
[11793.93s -> 11800.17s]  That's it. That's the end of the stream. Thanks for watching. There's a lot of food now. The pantry
[11800.17s -> 11805.80s]  is gonna be full of food for like a year. I actually enjoyed these as much as I pretend like
[11805.80s -> 11811.29s]  I don't. They're actually better. I just wish they weren't blue because why are they blue?
[11811.29s -> 11820.54s]  Very cool. Very cool. Very excited. I'm very excited. Really? Okay. Maybe we'll do like some
[11820.54s -> 11825.46s]  more taste testing eventually here. That was a lot of fun. I had a good time. I'm not clapping. I'm
[11825.46s -> 11831.19s]  not clapping because like I did a good job. I'm clapping because there's like shit all over me.
[11831.19s -> 11840.18s]  I kind of want to eat more of this grandma bread. Does this hit the ground? Very good. All right.
[11840.18s -> 11845.24s]  Well, I got some stuff going on this weekend so I won't be around. When I come back, I'll be around
[11845.24s -> 11854.86s]  on Tuesday? No, Tuesday. On Tuesday, we're going to do blood wash and murder house. So he's clapping
[11854.86s -> 11866.07s]  his ass cheeks. Where's Monster Rancher? I don't know. Grandma went sicko mode. All right. I'll
[11866.07s -> 11871.32s]  see you guys later. That's it. I'll see you guys on Tuesday. Thanks for watching. The nature of
[11871.32s -> 11876.10s]  this stream. I kind of need to just go to the outro. So I'm going to clean up and make sure
[11876.10s -> 11879.64s]  nothing's on the ground for auto so I don't eat anything. So I'll see you guys later. See you
[11879.64s -> 11888.62s]  Tuesday. I'll come over there. I'll see you Tuesday. Thanks for watching everybody. See you soon.
[11888.87s -> 11897.91s]  Tuesday at four o'clock. Can you hear me? Tuesday at four o'clock tonight.
[11897.91s -> 11991.66s]  And thank Holly for helping because that I couldn't have done this alone.
