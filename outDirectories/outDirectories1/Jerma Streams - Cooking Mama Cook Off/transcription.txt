[1.53s -> 8.52s]  Alright, unfortunately we're gonna have to pivot, because, uh, Beautiful Jo's not gonna work either, because this memory card is, is, is not, it's just like, toast.
[9.52s -> 14.02s]  Uh, alright, good, cool. So, I'm gonna have a new memory card, it'll work tomorrow.
[14.52s -> 18.02s]  Alright, so we're gonna pivot, we're gonna pivot.
[18.52s -> 20.52s]  I'm gonna use the same fucking console.
[22.03s -> 23.53s]  We're gonna pivot to the Wii.
[25.74s -> 27.24s]  It's time to pivot.
[27.74s -> 35.31s]  Oh, we're, we're pivoting.
[35.81s -> 38.31s]  To Rage Cooking Mama Cook-Off.
[38.81s -> 43.37s]  That's a, that's a hard fucking rage pivot if I've ever seen one.
[43.87s -> 53.47s]  It's in a fucking disk.
[53.97s -> 55.47s]  Unbelievable.
[57.28s -> 57.78s]  Ah.
[64.16s -> 65.66s]  I'm gonna be on cam for this one.
[67.87s -> 68.37s]  Me.
[74.29s -> 76.79s]  Imagine wanting Rain World over Cooking Mama?
[77.29s -> 80.54s]  I mean, they're both, they're both pretty interesting.
[81.04s -> 92.32s]  Uh, so tomorrow, we're gonna, we're gonna do this again tomorrow.
[92.82s -> 102.32s]  I, I know, I know, I, I see that it takes 10 minutes for the SD card, but I don't know, I, I don't even know where an SD card is.
[102.82s -> 109.06s]  I have to go, like, look for where my SD cards, I, like, that, that's like a 30 to 40 minute experience.
[109.56s -> 112.56s]  It's not just, download two items, download, and it's done, done.
[113.81s -> 117.31s]  We're in the middle of a broadcast, I'm not gonna be like, ah, see you guys in like 30 minutes.
[117.81s -> 118.81s]  Or, like, I'll look for an SD card.
[119.31s -> 126.45s]  There's one somewhere in this house, and I don't know where it is.
[126.95s -> 130.16s]  Now, we're just gonna do it tomorrow.
[130.66s -> 135.98s]  In your Wii, I don't have an SD card in the Wii.
[136.48s -> 140.99s]  Alright, let's go.
[141.49s -> 144.13s]  Here, you know what, let's just do this.
[144.63s -> 145.13s]  Welcome to the stream.
[145.63s -> 146.13s]  Because we're starting over.
[147.63s -> 148.13s]  See you in a second.
[148.63s -> 200.74s]  We're also gonna go on cam for this one.
[202.24s -> 204.74s]  Because, you know, I have the Wiimotes and shit in my hand.
[206.99s -> 208.49s]  Hey, what's going on, how are you guys?
[208.99s -> 215.76s]  Just joining, we're, we're welcome, everybody, to the stream.
[216.76s -> 220.54s]  Hope you guys had a good, uh, couple of days here.
[223.06s -> 224.06s]  I've been alright, I've been okay.
[225.06s -> 225.86s]  I'm pretty good.
[225.86s -> 235.38s]  I had a run in with, um, some flash memory over the last couple of days.
[235.88s -> 240.06s]  I want to take, um, I'm thinking about taking a hammer to something.
[240.56s -> 242.24s]  You know, just nothing too major.
[242.74s -> 243.24s]  Yeah, we'll get started.
[246.03s -> 247.53s]  We're gonna do Cooking Mama Cook Off.
[248.03s -> 249.53s]  Cooking Mama Cook Off.
[250.03s -> 251.53s]  That's what I've heard we're gonna do today.
[252.03s -> 256.29s]  Sounds good.
[256.79s -> 259.04s]  Alright, let me just make a tweet.
[259.54s -> 261.04s]  Delete the old tweet that I had.
[261.54s -> 263.04s]  I had something wrong with my iPhone like an hour and a half ago.
[264.04s -> 268.15s]  It said, it said, the chibi robo.
[268.65s -> 269.15s]  I didn't, I didn't write that.
[269.65s -> 270.15s]  I had something happen.
[270.65s -> 272.15s]  I got like a fucking virus or something.
[272.65s -> 273.15s]  Alright.
[280.54s -> 283.93s]  I'm so sad.
[284.43s -> 285.93s]  I like it, it worked too.
[286.43s -> 288.93s]  I'm hounded by a fucking ghost.
[289.43s -> 292.43s]  There's a ghost that follows me everywhere.
[292.93s -> 294.43s]  Like a technology ghost.
[294.93s -> 297.31s]  Alright, let's go.
[304.90s -> 305.40s]  Cooking Mama.
[305.90s -> 306.40s]  I'm ready.
[306.90s -> 308.40s]  I actually am excited for this one too.
[309.40s -> 311.90s]  I also have to change the title.
[314.24s -> 315.74s]  Because this doesn't make any sense.
[316.24s -> 319.74s]  The ultimate household, the ultimate household chef.
[320.24s -> 320.74s]  How does that sound?
[321.24s -> 322.74s]  The ultimate household chef?
[323.67s -> 333.98s]  I just have to change one word.
[334.48s -> 334.98s]  Cooking Mama.
[335.48s -> 340.36s]  How many Cooking Mamas are there?
[340.86s -> 343.36s]  There's like 30 of these games?
[345.06s -> 345.56s]  Alright, let's go.
[348.35s -> 348.85s]  That looked weird.
[349.35s -> 355.61s]  Alright, let's get a good view of me and my Wii.
[357.50s -> 358.00s]  I've got my Wiimote.
[358.50s -> 360.00s]  I've got my Nunchuck.
[360.00s -> 364.75s]  Let me make this look better.
[373.17s -> 373.67s]  Okay.
[375.75s -> 384.04s]  I'm ready.
[384.54s -> 387.35s]  Time to chop and cut and eat.
[387.85s -> 390.36s]  Why do I look so mad?
[390.86s -> 400.24s]  Well, an hour and 25 minutes went by of a game I wanted to play and my fucking GameCube memory card was corrupted.
[400.74s -> 403.24s]  I don't think it's sunshine and rainbows right now for me.
[405.69s -> 406.19s]  Yes, I do.
[406.69s -> 408.19s]  I would love to create a save file.
[408.69s -> 412.60s]  Watch this not work either.
[419.68s -> 423.18s]  Hey, by the way, no hand strap physically even on this Wiimote.
[425.90s -> 427.40s]  It's got a corrupted Wii.
[432.70s -> 434.28s]  I'm ready.
[434.78s -> 435.77s]  Should I go?
[436.27s -> 436.77s]  I should go like...
[437.27s -> 437.77s]  Can you guys see my hands?
[438.27s -> 438.77s]  Don't matter.
[439.27s -> 440.78s]  New game.
[442.28s -> 445.58s]  File 1.
[446.08s -> 446.58s]  New file.
[450.08s -> 450.58s]  Friends is...
[451.08s -> 451.58s]  Let's cook.
[452.08s -> 452.58s]  Alright, I don't know how to play.
[453.08s -> 453.58s]  I need to learn how to play.
[454.08s -> 454.58s]  You sweaty?
[455.08s -> 455.58s]  I'm not sweaty.
[457.08s -> 457.58s]  Let's cook.
[463.12s -> 463.62s]  Select recipe.
[464.12s -> 464.62s]  Okay, there's...
[465.12s -> 465.62s]  What is it?
[467.12s -> 467.62s]  Minestrone soup?
[468.12s -> 469.62s]  Is this game hard?
[472.12s -> 473.62s]  Beef and wine sauce.
[475.12s -> 475.62s]  Custard.
[476.12s -> 476.62s]  We're doing custard.
[477.12s -> 477.62s]  Okay, start.
[479.12s -> 481.65s]  I'm just...
[482.15s -> 482.65s]  I'm going off the grid.
[483.15s -> 484.65s]  I'm fucking deleting myself right now.
[485.15s -> 487.65s]  You can reach me through fucking carrier mail.
[488.15s -> 489.65s]  Alright, practice.
[491.15s -> 495.34s]  Swing the Wii remote in order to tap the eggs on the bowl.
[495.84s -> 497.34s]  When it cracks, press the A button to put the egg in the bowl.
[498.84s -> 500.22s]  Okay.
[500.72s -> 507.02s]  Add and use the clues to add the correct items to the bowl.
[507.52s -> 509.02s]  Point at the item and pick it up with the B button.
[509.52s -> 511.02s]  Follow the on-screen instructions to add items.
[511.52s -> 512.02s]  Okay.
[512.52s -> 516.02s]  Point the Wii remote down and turn it to stir.
[516.52s -> 519.26s]  Don't do too hard, it'll spill.
[521.45s -> 522.95s]  Twist the Wii remote right, left, to pour.
[523.45s -> 523.95s]  Okay.
[526.45s -> 527.95s]  Twist the Wii remote.
[528.45s -> 529.95s]  We're using a microwave, mama?
[531.65s -> 532.15s]  Game's too quiet?
[532.65s -> 533.15s]  What?
[533.65s -> 536.54s]  Game's too loud.
[538.56s -> 540.06s]  Don't think mama's using a microwave?
[540.56s -> 543.07s]  Alright, I got it.
[543.57s -> 544.07s]  Let's try it.
[561.74s -> 562.24s]  Got it!
[565.99s -> 566.49s]  I thought I was putting...
[566.99s -> 567.49s]  I thought I was cracking...
[567.99s -> 568.49s]  Ew!
[568.99s -> 570.49s]  I thought I was cracking eggs.
[570.99s -> 575.23s]  I thought I was supposed to be cracking eggs.
[575.73s -> 579.52s]  Oh, this is practice.
[580.02s -> 580.52s]  Okay.
[581.02s -> 582.52s]  It's each step.
[583.02s -> 583.52s]  I get it.
[584.02s -> 585.52s]  Alright, we'll do eggs.
[587.79s -> 588.29s]  Nah, I don't...
[588.79s -> 589.29s]  I'll practice, I'm good.
[589.79s -> 590.29s]  Let's go.
[591.79s -> 595.94s]  Swing the Wii remote in order to tap the egg on the bowl.
[595.94s -> 597.44s]  When it cracks, press A to put it...
[597.94s -> 598.44s]  Okay, here we go.
[598.94s -> 599.44s]  Ready?
[608.45s -> 620.30s]  What's wrong with that?
[628.15s -> 630.66s]  Oh, it's gonna be little.
[632.16s -> 634.98s]  It's gonna be small tap.
[635.48s -> 639.94s]  I got it.
[640.44s -> 640.94s]  Alright.
[645.52s -> 646.02s]  Done.
[646.52s -> 647.02s]  Better than mama.
[647.52s -> 649.02s]  Mama, you're doing not very good.
[649.52s -> 652.92s]  Alright, now it's gonna add ingredients.
[653.42s -> 655.92s]  Use the clues to add the correct items to the bowl.
[656.42s -> 657.92s]  Point at the item and pick it up with the B button.
[658.42s -> 659.92s]  Okay, follow the instructions.
[661.68s -> 662.18s]  Oh, shit.
[662.18s -> 662.68s]  Okay, I gotta pick up the...
[663.18s -> 663.68s]  Egg.
[664.18s -> 665.68s]  I don't know which one of these is egg.
[666.18s -> 666.68s]  What?
[670.11s -> 674.22s]  It's not egg?
[674.72s -> 677.57s]  Oh.
[686.95s -> 687.45s]  Okay, we're good.
[688.77s -> 690.27s]  I was asking for egg.
[690.77s -> 697.82s]  I gotta leave him for the coffee.
[698.32s -> 700.08s]  Alright, stir.
[700.58s -> 703.08s]  Point the Wii remote down and move it around quickly.
[703.58s -> 705.08s]  If you don't stir too hard, it'll spill.
[716.68s -> 717.18s]  That's going too fast.
[717.68s -> 718.18s]  Faster?
[726.09s -> 727.59s]  No, I don't want it to spill.
[731.94s -> 733.44s]  Okay, now put it into the mold.
[733.94s -> 734.44s]  Push the Wii remote...
[734.94s -> 735.44s]  Okay.
[735.44s -> 736.94s]  ...right to four.
[737.44s -> 738.94s]  Put carefully to make sure it doesn't overflow.
[739.44s -> 739.94s]  Okay.
[740.44s -> 740.94s]  Careful.
[741.44s -> 741.94s]  Careful.
[742.44s -> 753.99s]  Is that good?
[754.49s -> 757.09s]  No!
[757.59s -> 758.09s]  It's okay.
[758.59s -> 759.09s]  We turned it into a muffin, mama.
[759.59s -> 760.09s]  It's okay.
[775.25s -> 775.75s]  Ooh.
[776.25s -> 781.90s]  How many do I have to do?
[782.40s -> 785.67s]  I want us a hundred points.
[786.17s -> 786.98s]  That's pretty good.
[792.88s -> 793.38s]  Not bad.
[796.23s -> 800.55s]  Good.
[802.12s -> 803.62s]  Alright, I'm almost done with it, right?
[804.81s -> 808.31s]  Alright, this is just twist the Wii remote while holding the A button to adjust the oven.
[808.31s -> 810.31s]  Watch the meter carefully.
[810.81s -> 812.31s]  When it reaches the red part, switch it off.
[812.81s -> 815.08s]  What?
[815.58s -> 817.08s]  I have to hold my finger on the oven?
[819.94s -> 820.44s]  Ten?
[821.75s -> 822.25s]  Fifteen?
[822.75s -> 823.94s]  Twenty?
[824.44s -> 826.31s]  How hot does this have to be?
[826.81s -> 828.64s]  That's good.
[829.14s -> 830.64s]  I didn't even cook them.
[831.14s -> 838.21s]  Alright.
[838.71s -> 840.21s]  Now this is just throw it out of the mold.
[840.71s -> 841.21s]  I remember.
[841.71s -> 842.21s]  Don't shake it too hard.
[842.71s -> 849.66s]  Okay.
[850.16s -> 850.66s]  Good job.
[851.16s -> 851.66s]  That was close.
[852.16s -> 856.61s]  That's good.
[857.11s -> 871.59s]  Did I get good on the whole thing?
[872.09s -> 875.08s]  Now do I have to eat it with my hands?
[880.06s -> 880.56s]  Eat it.
[881.06s -> 881.56s]  Alright.
[882.06s -> 882.56s]  Results.
[883.06s -> 883.56s]  Very good.
[884.06s -> 884.56s]  Good.
[885.06s -> 885.56s]  Try harder.
[886.06s -> 888.47s]  Try harder.
[889.97s -> 890.90s]  Did I lose?
[894.88s -> 895.68s]  I got a new recipe.
[896.18s -> 898.68s]  Oh, a fucking grilled cheese sliders!
[899.18s -> 904.15s]  Alright.
[904.65s -> 905.15s]  I want like a...
[905.65s -> 907.15s]  I don't want just like a piece of custard.
[907.65s -> 909.15s]  Let's do soup.
[909.65s -> 910.15s]  Finish from.
[910.65s -> 914.56s]  Hold the Wii remote upright.
[915.06s -> 915.56s]  Yeah, alright.
[916.06s -> 916.56s]  Upright and moving forward and backward.
[917.06s -> 918.56s]  This is to open the can.
[918.56s -> 922.06s]  Press A button when the meter gets to the yellow portion to open the lid.
[924.74s -> 925.24s]  That's good.
[945.56s -> 947.06s]  Why is it coming out of a...
[947.56s -> 949.06s]  Mama, you're using a toaster oven.
[949.56s -> 951.06s]  You're getting soup out of a can.
[954.84s -> 955.34s]  Alright.
[955.84s -> 957.34s]  Move it so we can peel the potatoes.
[957.84s -> 961.54s]  Move it from the top to the bottom to peel the skin.
[962.04s -> 962.54s]  Okay.
[967.04s -> 975.90s]  Not efficient.
[976.40s -> 978.08s]  Very inefficient.
[978.58s -> 993.72s]  Alright, it's done.
[994.22s -> 994.72s]  It's done.
[1008.88s -> 1011.38s]  This is where Mom doesn't ask you to do this again.
[1011.88s -> 1018.28s]  This is where you peel the carrot to a point where there's like a toothpick worth of carrot.
[1020.47s -> 1022.97s]  It just turns into this like skinny little shitty thing.
[1023.47s -> 1026.97s]  Because you peeled off the skin and you peeled off all the actual vegetable.
[1027.47s -> 1036.61s]  Oh, you did it better than Mama!
[1042.12s -> 1042.62s]  See that?
[1043.75s -> 1045.25s]  Alright, finely chop.
[1045.75s -> 1047.25s]  First, trace the arrow with the...
[1047.75s -> 1049.49s]  I spit all over my mouth.
[1049.49s -> 1051.99s]  Trace the arrow with the Wiimote to cut the ingredients when they are cut.
[1052.49s -> 1054.99s]  Shake the Wiimote up and down to finely chop them.
[1055.49s -> 1055.99s]  So I go...
[1056.49s -> 1056.99s]  Boink!
[1057.49s -> 1057.99s]  And then...
[1074.74s -> 1092.25s]  Onion!
[1104.13s -> 1104.63s]  Green bean!
[1115.67s -> 1117.18s]  Very good.
[1117.68s -> 1121.08s]  Move the Wiimote forward and backward to cut the...
[1121.58s -> 1122.08s]  More cutting.
[1125.49s -> 1125.99s]  More cutting.
[1126.49s -> 1126.99s]  Okay, I can do this.
[1127.49s -> 1127.99s]  I'm pretty good at the cutting.
[1128.49s -> 1128.99s]  Bacon.
[1129.49s -> 1135.71s]  This is a lot of bacon.
[1136.21s -> 1138.72s]  This is like a whole loaf of ham.
[1143.95s -> 1145.01s]  Stir fry.
[1145.51s -> 1146.01s]  This is...
[1146.51s -> 1147.01s]  Alright.
[1147.51s -> 1150.01s]  To add to the pan, select the icons with the A button.
[1150.51s -> 1153.01s]  Move the Wiimote toward and away from you to prevent burning.
[1154.51s -> 1155.64s]  When the...
[1156.14s -> 1157.64s]  When two circles appear, press finished.
[1159.14s -> 1160.07s]  We're just like...
[1160.57s -> 1161.07s]  We just...
[1161.57s -> 1163.07s]  This is how you pretend to be a chef.
[1164.57s -> 1166.07s]  Do you ever want someone to think that you're interesting?
[1166.57s -> 1168.07s]  Let's say you have a date and somebody's like,
[1168.57s -> 1169.07s]  Oh, but you can cook!
[1169.57s -> 1170.07s]  You're like, I can cook.
[1170.57s -> 1171.07s]  I can cook.
[1171.57s -> 1172.07s]  Just period.
[1172.57s -> 1173.07s]  Listen to me.
[1173.57s -> 1174.07s]  Put spinach.
[1174.07s -> 1174.57s]  Put spinach.
[1175.07s -> 1175.57s]  A little bit of spinach in a pan.
[1176.07s -> 1177.57s]  A little bit of like olive oil.
[1178.07s -> 1178.57s]  And just like...
[1180.07s -> 1181.57s]  While they're in the room with you.
[1182.07s -> 1185.02s]  It'll work every time.
[1185.52s -> 1189.02s]  Put like some green beans, some bell peppers, some onions.
[1189.52s -> 1192.02s]  And like a little bit of other water-based vegetables.
[1192.52s -> 1195.02s]  And just shake it like, yeah, I know what I'm doing.
[1195.52s -> 1198.02s]  This is the I pretend to know how to fucking cook stream.
[1198.52s -> 1200.02s]  I don't know why I'm streaming this, but you know.
[1200.52s -> 1206.53s]  And then make something up while they have to leave.
[1207.03s -> 1210.69s]  Alright, let's put the bacon in.
[1211.19s -> 1211.69s]  Onions.
[1212.19s -> 1212.69s]  Green beans.
[1213.19s -> 1213.69s]  Carrots.
[1214.19s -> 1214.69s]  Potatoes.
[1215.19s -> 1215.69s]  Doesn't even matter.
[1217.45s -> 1218.83s]  Let's just do this.
[1219.33s -> 1219.83s]  Looks pretty good.
[1220.33s -> 1220.83s]  Just put it all in the pan.
[1221.33s -> 1221.83s]  Carrots.
[1223.40s -> 1223.90s]  Okay, take it out.
[1230.25s -> 1230.99s]  What was wrong with that?
[1231.49s -> 1232.99s]  What was wrong with that?
[1233.49s -> 1237.18s]  Underdone?
[1237.68s -> 1238.18s]  I didn't finish it?
[1238.68s -> 1240.18s]  What was undercooked?
[1240.68s -> 1241.18s]  What?
[1243.07s -> 1243.57s]  Stew.
[1244.07s -> 1244.57s]  Stir.
[1245.07s -> 1245.57s]  Rotate the Wii mode.
[1247.07s -> 1248.57s]  You put everything in at the same time?
[1249.07s -> 1249.57s]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[1250.07s -> 1251.57s]  That's how you impress your date.
[1252.57s -> 1255.37s]  Everything just goes into this and it makes like a...
[1256.87s -> 1260.70s]  And then they just think that you know what you're doing.
[1262.53s -> 1263.03s]  Rotate the Wii remote.
[1263.53s -> 1264.03s]  Add.
[1264.53s -> 1266.03s]  Point to the icon and press the A button to add.
[1266.53s -> 1267.03s]  Adjust the heat.
[1267.53s -> 1268.03s]  Twist the remote.
[1268.53s -> 1269.03s]  Adjust the heat.
[1269.53s -> 1270.03s]  We're just stewing it now.
[1276.12s -> 1276.62s]  Add what?
[1277.12s -> 1277.62s]  Add?
[1278.12s -> 1278.80s]  Add salt.
[1281.86s -> 1282.36s]  Medium.
[1283.42s -> 1288.00s]  Stir it.
[1288.50s -> 1289.00s]  A little bit of salt in there.
[1289.50s -> 1290.00s]  I don't know.
[1290.50s -> 1291.00s]  Pepper.
[1291.50s -> 1292.00s]  Heat on high.
[1292.00s -> 1292.50s]  What do I put in the corn?
[1293.00s -> 1295.78s]  Put in a can of tomatoes?
[1297.28s -> 1297.78s]  Add wheat.
[1299.28s -> 1299.78s]  All right.
[1300.28s -> 1304.86s]  Green beans are in.
[1305.36s -> 1305.86s]  Stir it up.
[1306.36s -> 1306.86s]  Looks good.
[1312.15s -> 1312.65s]  Not bad.
[1313.15s -> 1313.65s]  Not bad.
[1314.39s -> 1314.89s]  I did it.
[1315.39s -> 1320.18s]  And then your date, you present this to them.
[1326.08s -> 1329.12s]  And they go...
[1329.62s -> 1331.12s]  And by the way, use a shitload of time.
[1331.62s -> 1334.12s]  But like, it doesn't even matter if the recipe calls for it.
[1334.62s -> 1335.12s]  Put like...
[1335.62s -> 1337.12s]  Half the bottle of the spice.
[1337.62s -> 1338.12s]  Half the spice bottle of time.
[1338.62s -> 1339.12s]  Half the bottle of time.
[1339.62s -> 1340.12s]  Half the bottle of time.
[1340.62s -> 1341.12s]  Half the bottle of time.
[1341.62s -> 1342.12s]  Half the bottle of time.
[1342.62s -> 1343.12s]  Half the bottle of time.
[1343.62s -> 1344.12s]  Like into the soup.
[1344.62s -> 1347.12s]  It just will smell like, oh, what an aroma.
[1347.62s -> 1350.12s]  And when you bring it, it'll fill the house with this thyme smell.
[1350.62s -> 1352.12s]  And it's like, holy shit, this person, look at this.
[1352.62s -> 1354.12s]  It smells delicious in here.
[1355.62s -> 1357.12s]  Just make sure they don't eat it.
[1359.33s -> 1359.83s]  Like...
[1360.33s -> 1361.83s]  Make a phone call.
[1363.02s -> 1363.52s]  Oh, what's the...
[1364.02s -> 1364.52s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1365.02s -> 1366.52s]  What, you want to meet us at...
[1367.02s -> 1367.52s]  Fucking...
[1369.26s -> 1369.76s]  21 Beef?
[1370.26s -> 1370.76s]  Or whatever the restaurant is?
[1371.26s -> 1371.76s]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[1372.26s -> 1372.76s]  And then you fucking hang up.
[1373.26s -> 1373.76s]  Hey, don't...
[1373.76s -> 1374.26s]  Don't...
[1374.76s -> 1376.26s]  We got a big dinner with some friends.
[1376.76s -> 1380.26s]  And then you go in there and you just pretend that you got fucking blown off by your friends.
[1380.76s -> 1382.26s]  And enjoy a nice dinner with your date.
[1382.76s -> 1391.92s]  Yeah, they have like 21 different steaks.
[1392.42s -> 1392.92s]  I don't know.
[1393.42s -> 1397.28s]  Web of life.
[1397.78s -> 1401.33s]  Wait, I didn't do the...
[1401.83s -> 1402.33s]  The flan?
[1402.83s -> 1403.33s]  Oh, I gotta...
[1403.83s -> 1405.33s]  Okay, I gotta try harder on this one.
[1405.83s -> 1413.91s]  Oh, honey, that looks...
[1414.41s -> 1416.91s]  Why would your first date be calling you honey?
[1418.93s -> 1419.43s]  Shit.
[1420.93s -> 1424.23s]  There we go.
[1424.73s -> 1425.23s]  Little life.
[1425.73s -> 1440.42s]  Fuck.
[1440.92s -> 1441.42s]  Egg sucker.
[1441.92s -> 1444.04s]  You want to know something funny about me and my life?
[1444.54s -> 1445.04s]  I...
[1445.54s -> 1446.04s]  I can't eat.
[1446.54s -> 1447.04s]  I don't...
[1447.54s -> 1448.04s]  I don't do egg.
[1448.54s -> 1449.04s]  I don't know how to do them.
[1449.54s -> 1450.04s]  I don't know how to open them.
[1453.17s -> 1454.67s]  Every time I try it, it just goes like...
[1455.17s -> 1456.67s]  It gets all over my hands and shit.
[1457.17s -> 1457.67s]  I don't...
[1458.17s -> 1458.67s]  I don't do...
[1459.17s -> 1459.67s]  I don't crack eggs.
[1460.17s -> 1460.67s]  I don't do it.
[1461.17s -> 1465.49s]  Alright, same deal.
[1465.99s -> 1466.49s]  Add the ingredients.
[1470.66s -> 1471.16s]  Egg.
[1471.66s -> 1475.48s]  Going in.
[1475.98s -> 1477.04s]  What's that?
[1477.54s -> 1478.04s]  Liquor.
[1478.54s -> 1479.53s]  Milk.
[1480.03s -> 1482.37s]  Instantly done.
[1482.87s -> 1483.37s]  Good.
[1483.87s -> 1484.37s]  That's easy.
[1486.38s -> 1488.70s]  Even better than mama.
[1490.20s -> 1495.30s]  I'm gonna do this wicked fast, but not that fast.
[1495.80s -> 1496.30s]  Ready?
[1536.17s -> 1537.67s]  Oh, nobody does this better than me.
[1555.08s -> 1555.58s]  Can I take...
[1556.08s -> 1556.58s]  Can I have it come up faster?
[1557.08s -> 1564.34s]  No bonus?
[1564.84s -> 1565.34s]  That's bullshit.
[1570.07s -> 1571.64s]  Bake it in the oven.
[1572.14s -> 1572.64s]  Now this...
[1573.14s -> 1575.64s]  Okay, twist the remote while holding A to adjust the oven.
[1576.14s -> 1577.64s]  Watch the meter carefully.
[1578.64s -> 1579.14s]  Turn off the oven when it...
[1579.64s -> 1580.14s]  Okay, so turn...
[1580.64s -> 1581.14s]  I gotta turn it on.
[1582.64s -> 1591.12s]  I got it.
[1595.27s -> 1596.77s]  I had to have made up for it, right?
[1597.27s -> 1598.77s]  That was when I just make them come out carefully.
[1603.37s -> 1603.87s]  That was gentle.
[1621.22s -> 1621.72s]  Fuck you!
[1622.22s -> 1622.72s]  Why?
[1632.30s -> 1632.80s]  I got it, right?
[1641.38s -> 1641.88s]  Try harder?
[1643.88s -> 1644.38s]  No, I got it.
[1644.88s -> 1645.38s]  This is...
[1645.88s -> 1646.38s]  I got a bronze medal.
[1650.55s -> 1651.05s]  I got it.
[1651.55s -> 1652.05s]  No, I got it.
[1652.55s -> 1653.23s]  Okay.
[1654.16s -> 1654.66s]  This is...
[1655.16s -> 1655.66s]  Mochi.
[1657.16s -> 1657.66s]  Let's do it.
[1659.68s -> 1660.68s]  Okay, add water.
[1661.68s -> 1662.18s]  Turn the water...
[1662.68s -> 1664.18s]  Turn on the water and fill the pot.
[1664.68s -> 1667.18s]  Tilt the remote upward to stop the water before it overflows.
[1680.25s -> 1681.25s]  Oh, I only get one shot.
[1682.25s -> 1684.50s]  I only get one shot.
[1688.63s -> 1689.63s]  Why am I apologizing?
[1693.18s -> 1694.18s]  Why am I apologizing?
[1694.68s -> 1695.18s]  What did I do?
[1696.61s -> 1698.11s]  Point the remote down and hold it upright.
[1698.61s -> 1699.11s]  This...
[1702.84s -> 1703.34s]  How long did it take this time?
[1703.84s -> 1704.34s]  An hour?
[1704.84s -> 1705.34s]  Forty minutes?
[1710.24s -> 1710.74s]  Swearing.
[1711.24s -> 1713.39s]  Okay.
[1713.89s -> 1714.89s]  Point the remote down and hold it upright.
[1715.39s -> 1716.89s]  Move it around quickly to wash.
[1717.39s -> 1718.89s]  When done, tilt the remote to drain the water.
[1719.39s -> 1719.89s]  So you go...
[1721.89s -> 1722.39s]  And then like this.
[1725.80s -> 1726.30s]  Say sorry to Mama.
[1726.80s -> 1727.80s]  Mama's not a real person.
[1728.80s -> 1740.26s]  What? Did I just knock it over?
[1744.05s -> 1744.55s]  I just...
[1745.05s -> 1746.05s]  I just washed everything.
[1746.55s -> 1748.05s]  And just dumped it onto the counter.
[1756.51s -> 1757.01s]  Go back, go back.
[1757.51s -> 1758.01s]  No, no.
[1758.51s -> 1761.30s]  I want to make Mochi.
[1763.81s -> 1764.31s]  Okay.
[1764.81s -> 1779.69s]  I hate Mama.
[1780.19s -> 1780.69s]  No.
[1781.19s -> 1781.69s]  I just said fuck.
[1782.19s -> 1783.69s]  I said like fuck you game.
[1786.84s -> 1787.34s]  This is not...
[1787.84s -> 1789.34s]  I don't have to apologize to somebody that...
[1789.84s -> 1792.34s]  No, I'm not apologizing to anything on the Wii right now.
[1792.84s -> 1794.34s]  I'm very upset with the Wii right now.
[1794.84s -> 1796.84s]  And the GameCube memory card in particular.
[1797.84s -> 1802.16s]  Go around quickly to wash.
[1802.66s -> 1805.16s]  Then tilt the Wii remote to drain the water.
[1808.57s -> 1809.07s]  Isn't that what I did?
[1813.94s -> 1815.45s]  Okay, A.
[1815.95s -> 1816.45s]  Now tilt.
[1817.95s -> 1822.79s]  What the fuck is going on there?
[1823.29s -> 1827.72s]  I'm just going a little...
[1833.68s -> 1834.18s]  Hold A.
[1837.12s -> 1837.62s]  Watch the meter carefully.
[1838.12s -> 1840.12s]  When the barbeque gets to red, switch it off.
[1841.12s -> 1850.95s]  Fucking simple.
[1858.88s -> 1860.12s]  Floor Mochi.
[1863.84s -> 1864.34s]  Alright, pound the Mochi.
[1864.84s -> 1866.34s]  Move the Wii remote up and down to pound the rice.
[1866.84s -> 1868.34s]  Take care not to accidentally...
[1868.84s -> 1869.34s]  Hit your hand.
[1871.02s -> 1871.52s]  There's no hand.
[1875.61s -> 1876.61s]  Mama, I'm sorry.
[1894.93s -> 1897.43s]  Mama's going to have fucking bruises all over her.
[1904.03s -> 1905.03s]  I've tried to do twice before.
[1923.28s -> 1925.28s]  You gotta go to the darkness office like this.
[1927.28s -> 1930.28s]  I'm covered in fucking wilt and fucking bruises and shit.
[1930.78s -> 1931.78s]  Oh, this is so bad.
[1932.78s -> 1938.95s]  I'll get this one next time.
[1939.45s -> 1941.01s]  I need to practice.
[1942.01s -> 1946.03s]  Hold the Wii remote upright and move it left and right.
[1947.03s -> 1951.53s]  If it gets hard to grate, move the Wii remote up and down to shake the loose ingredients.
[1952.03s -> 1953.03s]  I gotta grate the cheese?
[1953.53s -> 1954.03s]  This cheese?
[1969.67s -> 1970.17s]  Get off!
[1972.91s -> 1974.41s]  This is shitload of cheese, Mama!
[1977.83s -> 1979.33s]  Mama, what are you doing?
[1979.83s -> 1981.33s]  Why is there so much cheese on this?
[1988.61s -> 1992.11s]  You know what I do whenever I'm cooking with a great bunch of cheese like that?
[1993.11s -> 1994.61s]  I get a little overwhelmed.
[1995.11s -> 2002.61s]  And I just grab the whole mound, the soft, mushy, stick-together mound of Parmesan cheese, and I just eat the whole fucking thing.
[2003.11s -> 2004.11s]  And then I have to do it again.
[2007.87s -> 2008.37s]  Follow the on-screen...
[2008.37s -> 2009.37s]  Okay, make some Mochi.
[2010.37s -> 2015.18s]  So just follow the on-screen action.
[2015.18s -> 2016.68s]  So it's like left and right, tilt, turn.
[2027.24s -> 2027.74s]  Okay.
[2028.24s -> 2029.24s]  Put it into the flour.
[2030.24s -> 2031.74s]  Roll it back and forth a couple times.
[2032.24s -> 2032.74s]  Get it dusted.
[2033.74s -> 2034.74s]  Into the chocolate.
[2039.54s -> 2040.54s]  Into the chocolate.
[2041.04s -> 2041.54s]  Soak it up.
[2043.22s -> 2043.72s]  Good.
[2044.91s -> 2045.41s]  Wrap it up.
[2051.13s -> 2051.63s]  Wrap it up.
[2052.82s -> 2053.32s]  One more.
[2053.32s -> 2053.82s]  Come on, hurry up.
[2056.85s -> 2057.35s]  Done.
[2065.54s -> 2066.54s]  Chocolate and cheese.
[2067.04s -> 2068.04s]  Well, it has to look like whatever.
[2068.54s -> 2069.54s]  Well, I don't even know what it was.
[2070.04s -> 2070.91s]  Complete.
[2071.41s -> 2071.91s]  All right.
[2075.20s -> 2075.70s]  Mochi.
[2076.20s -> 2080.77s]  I'm probably going to have to do this again.
[2084.18s -> 2084.68s]  Bronze.
[2084.68s -> 2085.18s]  Sorry.
[2085.18s -> 2085.68s]  I still completed it.
[2088.96s -> 2089.46s]  Three cookies.
[2089.96s -> 2090.46s]  You have a new recipe.
[2092.46s -> 2092.96s]  I don't know what that is.
[2093.96s -> 2094.96s]  I'm looking forward to it though.
[2097.80s -> 2099.30s]  Should I do the scrambled eggs?
[2099.80s -> 2100.30s]  I knew it.
[2100.30s -> 2100.80s]  See?
[2100.80s -> 2101.80s]  Oh, I thought it was scrambled eggs.
[2101.80s -> 2102.80s]  It's scrambled eggs.
[2103.30s -> 2104.80s]  I make a brutally good scrambled egg.
[2105.30s -> 2106.30s]  What I do is I panic.
[2106.80s -> 2108.30s]  When I get the eggs into the pan,
[2108.80s -> 2110.80s]  and I freak out because I don't want to undo them,
[2110.80s -> 2112.80s]  and I end up overdoing them by about five straight minutes.
[2113.30s -> 2114.80s]  But they're like brown all over.
[2115.30s -> 2116.80s]  So, I make a pretty mean scrambled egg.
[2117.30s -> 2117.80s]  Okay.
[2117.80s -> 2119.80s]  Swing the Wiimote in order to tap the egg on the bowl.
[2126.02s -> 2126.52s]  Is it good?
[2167.63s -> 2168.13s]  All right.
[2168.13s -> 2168.63s]  Open the can.
[2168.63s -> 2169.13s]  I need to do a test here.
[2169.13s -> 2169.63s]  Hold on.
[2170.13s -> 2177.78s]  It's a way off.
[2177.78s -> 2179.93s]  All right.
[2179.93s -> 2180.43s]  Hold on.
[2180.43s -> 2180.93s]  Ready?
[2180.93s -> 2181.43s]  Oh!
[2181.43s -> 2215.84s]  Hold on.
[2215.84s -> 2216.34s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[2216.34s -> 2216.84s]  Hold on.
[2216.84s -> 2217.34s]  I got it.
[2233.51s -> 2238.01s]  Right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye.
[2238.51s -> 2240.08s]  Good, right?
[2240.58s -> 2242.16s]  Better?
[2242.16s -> 2250.06s]  It's better.
[2250.56s -> 2256.02s]  It might take a little bit more moving around.
[2256.02s -> 2266.78s]  You need a psychiatrist.
[2268.60s -> 2271.10s]  You're trying to sync my gameplay to my webcam?
[2271.60s -> 2277.84s]  All right.
[2277.84s -> 2278.34s]  Scramble the eggs.
[2281.63s -> 2282.63s]  What the hell is that?
[2283.82s -> 2284.32s]  Egg?
[2284.82s -> 2290.06s]  Why is it doing like this weird mystery thing?
[2290.56s -> 2293.08s]  Cream cheese.
[2293.58s -> 2296.08s]  I don't know what the fuck cream cheese looks like in this game.
[2297.08s -> 2297.58s]  Milk.
[2298.08s -> 2300.48s]  How's that not milk?
[2300.98s -> 2308.31s]  All right.
[2308.31s -> 2309.31s]  Now in goes the prosciutto.
[2319.30s -> 2319.80s]  All right.
[2320.48s -> 2320.98s]  Grab.
[2320.98s -> 2321.48s]  All right, guys.
[2321.48s -> 2322.48s]  Do the wing.
[2323.48s -> 2375.16s]  Down.
[2375.16s -> 2375.66s]  Down.
[2375.66s -> 2376.16s]  Down.
[2376.16s -> 2376.66s]  Down.
[2376.66s -> 2377.16s]  Down.
[2377.16s -> 2377.66s]  Down.
[2378.16s -> 2379.66s]  I think we're good.
[2380.16s -> 2382.04s]  Spread the butter.
[2382.54s -> 2386.36s]  Build the Wii mode carefully to coat the frying pan with butter.
[2402.03s -> 2403.53s]  It's gonna stick right there.
[2403.53s -> 2405.53s]  Gotta get it all before the time runs out.
[2405.53s -> 2406.03s]  Got it.
[2406.53s -> 2410.45s]  Let's go read a bunch of books.
[2410.95s -> 2411.95s]  Good idea.
[2412.95s -> 2415.52s]  Increase your smarts.
[2417.16s -> 2417.66s]  All right.
[2417.66s -> 2418.16s]  Cook eggs.
[2418.66s -> 2419.16s]  Shake.
[2419.16s -> 2420.16s]  Shake the Wii mode.
[2420.66s -> 2421.96s]  Ack and forth.
[2422.46s -> 2423.96s]  Hold Wii mode upright.
[2424.96s -> 2426.76s]  And turn it around while holding B button.
[2426.76s -> 2427.26s]  Season.
[2427.26s -> 2428.76s]  Shake Wii mode while holding A button.
[2429.76s -> 2430.26s]  Okay.
[2431.32s -> 2432.32s]  Let's cook these eggs.
[2446.57s -> 2448.65s]  Not too much.
[2449.65s -> 2455.19s]  All right.
[2455.19s -> 2455.69s]  They're done.
[2455.69s -> 2456.19s]  They're done.
[2456.19s -> 2456.69s]  They're done.
[2456.69s -> 2457.19s]  They're done.
[2457.19s -> 2457.69s]  They're done.
[2457.69s -> 2459.57s]  Mama, too much salt.
[2468.62s -> 2470.12s]  Looks like vomit.
[2472.44s -> 2472.94s]  Mama.
[2472.94s -> 2473.44s]  Mama.
[2473.44s -> 2473.94s]  Sodium.
[2473.94s -> 2474.94s]  Mama, too much sodium.
[2475.44s -> 2482.06s]  I don't like salty eggs.
[2483.06s -> 2484.25s]  I'd rather take...
[2484.75s -> 2486.25s]  Instead of putting a bunch of salt on eggs,
[2486.25s -> 2486.75s]  I'd like to do...
[2487.25s -> 2489.75s]  Just a little dollop of tabasco...
[2490.25s -> 2491.75s]  I was gonna say tabascio.
[2491.75s -> 2492.75s]  Like pistachio.
[2492.75s -> 2493.75s]  Tabasco sauce.
[2495.25s -> 2495.75s]  Just like...
[2497.42s -> 2497.92s]  And then you just like...
[2498.42s -> 2498.92s]  Let it get in there.
[2499.92s -> 2504.82s]  Tabasco.
[2505.32s -> 2505.82s]  Tabasco.
[2507.32s -> 2507.82s]  It's a...
[2509.32s -> 2515.38s]  New?
[2515.38s -> 2515.88s]  What's this?
[2516.88s -> 2517.88s]  Beef and wine sauce.
[2518.38s -> 2518.88s]  Ooh.
[2519.38s -> 2519.88s]  I like it.
[2522.46s -> 2522.96s]  Okay.
[2522.96s -> 2524.96s]  Trace the arrow with the Wii mode to cut the ingredients.
[2525.96s -> 2526.64s]  This one...
[2526.64s -> 2527.14s]  This is elaborate.
[2527.14s -> 2527.64s]  This one's a lot.
[2529.31s -> 2529.81s]  All right.
[2529.81s -> 2530.31s]  I gotta get a good score here.
[2541.98s -> 2542.48s]  Beef rib.
[2553.21s -> 2554.21s]  Geo physics?
[2560.49s -> 2561.49s]  I love a good wine.
[2562.80s -> 2563.30s]  All right.
[2563.30s -> 2563.80s]  We gotta peel.
[2563.80s -> 2564.80s]  I was bad at this before.
[2584.87s -> 2586.62s]  One fluid motion.
[2600.60s -> 2601.60s]  It hurts my ADHD so bad.
[2601.60s -> 2602.60s]  You know what I mean?
[2608.89s -> 2609.39s]  It's hard.
[2609.39s -> 2609.89s]  I fuck.
[2609.89s -> 2610.89s]  This hurts my ADHD.
[2610.89s -> 2611.89s]  Like it hurts my whole body.
[2615.56s -> 2616.06s]  Yeah.
[2616.06s -> 2617.06s]  Some of you guys know what I'm talking about.
[2617.06s -> 2620.88s]  All right.
[2620.88s -> 2621.38s]  Mince the beef.
[2622.38s -> 2622.88s]  Shake the Wii mode.
[2622.88s -> 2623.38s]  Up and down.
[2623.38s -> 2624.38s]  Chop the ingredients.
[2624.38s -> 2624.88s]  That's it.
[2624.88s -> 2625.88s]  So just chop.
[2638.71s -> 2644.51s]  The shallots.
[2645.01s -> 2649.64s]  That looks like a banana.
[2650.64s -> 2651.64s]  Get the mushrooms in there.
[2652.14s -> 2652.64s]  Come.
[2659.72s -> 2660.22s]  Okay.
[2660.22s -> 2662.72s]  Use the clues to add the correct items to the bowl.
[2662.72s -> 2663.22s]  This one.
[2663.22s -> 2664.22s]  You have to guess.
[2665.22s -> 2666.60s]  Point at the item.
[2666.60s -> 2667.60s]  Pick it up with the B button.
[2668.10s -> 2676.72s]  Okay.
[2677.22s -> 2678.40s]  Pepper.
[2679.40s -> 2679.90s]  Then...
[2680.90s -> 2681.40s]  What's that?
[2681.90s -> 2682.40s]  Gravy.
[2683.90s -> 2684.84s]  And then...
[2685.34s -> 2686.34s]  The vegetables.
[2686.84s -> 2687.84s]  And then a little bit of this.
[2687.84s -> 2688.34s]  There it is.
[2688.34s -> 2688.84s]  Garnish.
[2689.34s -> 2689.84s]  Is that thyme?
[2696.98s -> 2703.98s]  Is it a coincidence that the Blade and Sorcerer video went up on YouTube the day you played Cooking Mama and you made a Cooking Mama joke in this video?
[2705.48s -> 2708.65s]  Yeah.
[2708.65s -> 2709.15s]  I think so.
[2710.65s -> 2711.15s]  Sprinkle.
[2711.65s -> 2713.85s]  Poke the ingredients.
[2713.85s -> 2715.85s]  Press A and the B button at the same time to sprinkle.
[2723.41s -> 2723.91s]  But I didn't...
[2726.83s -> 2727.33s]  Is that too much?
[2735.62s -> 2738.51s]  I don't know what I'm seasoning it with.
[2740.01s -> 2741.51s]  I'm just dumping shit on it.
[2742.01s -> 2748.31s]  I think that's alright.
[2749.81s -> 2751.38s]  Why is she so...
[2751.38s -> 2751.88s]  Wait, she...
[2752.88s -> 2753.88s]  She's so great.
[2754.38s -> 2754.88s]  Why...
[2754.88s -> 2755.38s]  What's going on?
[2756.38s -> 2758.01s]  Alright.
[2758.01s -> 2758.51s]  Spread the butter.
[2758.51s -> 2759.01s]  Alright.
[2759.01s -> 2759.51s]  Coat the butter in the pan.
[2759.51s -> 2760.01s]  I know this one.
[2762.75s -> 2763.75s]  Around the edges first.
[2770.01s -> 2773.42s]  Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun!
[2780.28s -> 2784.66s]  Okay.
[2784.66s -> 2785.16s]  Stir fry.
[2788.81s -> 2789.31s]  Let's go.
[2789.31s -> 2789.81s]  Get it all in there.
[2791.93s -> 2792.43s]  Alright.
[2792.43s -> 2792.93s]  What cooks the longest?
[2792.93s -> 2793.93s]  Put the beef in first.
[2798.95s -> 2800.45s]  And then the mushrooms.
[2800.95s -> 2805.77s]  And then put the rest in.
[2827.45s -> 2827.95s]  It's charred.
[2827.95s -> 2829.45s]  It's charred, mate.
[2829.45s -> 2829.95s]  It's charred.
[2829.95s -> 2830.45s]  That's what I'm saying.
[2831.45s -> 2832.19s]  Alright.
[2832.19s -> 2833.19s]  Rotate the Wii mode.
[2833.19s -> 2833.69s]  Add.
[2833.69s -> 2834.19s]  Okay.
[2834.19s -> 2835.69s]  This is the stew part.
[2837.70s -> 2838.20s]  Put it all in the stew.
[2839.70s -> 2840.57s]  Add.
[2841.57s -> 2842.07s]  Salt.
[2843.13s -> 2843.63s]  Medium heat.
[2846.44s -> 2847.82s]  On medium.
[2848.82s -> 2849.63s]  Stir it up.
[2853.81s -> 2855.31s]  Add a little bit of whatever the fuck this is.
[2856.81s -> 2857.31s]  Put it on high.
[2858.31s -> 2861.65s]  Put a little bit of whatever this is with it.
[2861.65s -> 2862.65s]  A tied up thing.
[2863.65s -> 2864.90s]  Stir it up.
[2868.51s -> 2869.01s]  Put it on low.
[2869.51s -> 2870.01s]  Perfectly done.
[2871.01s -> 2872.32s]  Perfectly done.
[2881.68s -> 2882.18s]  How's it look?
[2882.68s -> 2883.42s]  Pretty good.
[2886.11s -> 2888.11s]  I don't like a chunky potato stew, though.
[2888.61s -> 2889.61s]  I like my potatoes to be...
[2890.11s -> 2890.61s]  Cubed.
[2891.61s -> 2895.12s]  If I do not have cubed potatoes,
[2895.62s -> 2896.12s]  I don't like it.
[2896.62s -> 2897.62s]  And they have to be...
[2898.12s -> 2900.12s]  Less than a half inch thick and a half inch wide.
[2900.12s -> 2900.62s]  You know what I'm saying?
[2900.62s -> 2902.12s]  I want cubed potatoes.
[2902.62s -> 2904.62s]  Big chunky potatoes don't do it for me.
[2909.76s -> 2911.26s]  The beef has to be also...
[2911.76s -> 2913.26s]  A cube-like shape.
[2914.76s -> 2916.26s]  I don't like big stringy long...
[2917.76s -> 2918.26s]  Pull.
[2918.26s -> 2918.76s]  Pull.
[2918.76s -> 2919.26s]  I gotta pull it.
[2919.26s -> 2919.76s]  No, no, no.
[2919.76s -> 2920.26s]  No.
[2920.76s -> 2922.26s]  It's gotta be cubed.
[2922.76s -> 2924.76s]  Small cubed up meat.
[2925.26s -> 2933.48s]  All carrots...
[2934.48s -> 2937.48s]  Must be a perfect small circle in diameter like this.
[2937.48s -> 2938.48s]  Like very small.
[2939.78s -> 2942.28s]  And they have to be less than a half inch thick.
[2951.46s -> 2952.46s]  Alright, we can move on to this.
[2952.46s -> 2952.96s]  Next one.
[2953.96s -> 2955.46s]  Ooh, shrimp and chili sauce.
[2957.32s -> 2957.82s]  Kurogi.
[2959.32s -> 2960.82s]  Popcorn of the United States.
[2962.32s -> 2962.82s]  Ooh, what do we have?
[2962.82s -> 2965.82s]  Oh, we have lots of great Italian and French cuisine.
[2965.82s -> 2966.82s]  Minestrone.
[2967.32s -> 2968.32s]  Oh, this is Japanese.
[2968.32s -> 2968.82s]  Mochi.
[2969.32s -> 2969.82s]  Oh, France.
[2969.82s -> 2970.82s]  Scrambled eggs.
[2971.32s -> 2971.82s]  What do I have from America?
[2973.32s -> 2973.82s]  Popcorn.
[2974.82s -> 2981.06s]  This is one step.
[2981.56s -> 2994.37s]  I love making popcorn on the stove though.
[2994.37s -> 2995.37s]  It is actually really good.
[2996.37s -> 2998.80s]  You gotta be careful though because you might put too much in
[2998.80s -> 3001.30s]  and that's when the lid starts to go up
[3001.30s -> 3002.80s]  and you start to make too much.
[3002.80s -> 3003.80s]  You start to freak out.
[3004.30s -> 3007.00s]  Look at this American cuisine.
[3008.00s -> 3018.20s]  Gotta keep it in the yellow.
[3018.20s -> 3018.70s]  That's it.
[3019.20s -> 3021.02s]  It's not burning.
[3021.02s -> 3021.52s]  It's fine.
[3038.37s -> 3039.87s]  Ah, classic American cuisine.
[3043.37s -> 3044.74s]  Add seasoning.
[3047.42s -> 3050.42s]  Why is it an open, like, salami sandwich?
[3050.42s -> 3052.92s]  When the bottle blinks, shake the Wiimote.
[3052.92s -> 3053.92s]  Shake with good timing.
[3053.92s -> 3055.42s]  When the bottle blinks?
[3060.94s -> 3064.18s]  What?
[3064.18s -> 3065.18s]  What's going on?
[3066.18s -> 3067.18s]  When the bottle blinks?
[3067.18s -> 3068.68s]  No bottle is blinking.
[3069.18s -> 3070.68s]  What do you mean the bottle blinks?
[3077.10s -> 3078.60s]  Who's putting the salt on?
[3082.54s -> 3083.54s]  That's not blink.
[3083.54s -> 3085.04s]  That's not blinking, by the way.
[3085.54s -> 3087.54s]  That is just growth.
[3087.54s -> 3089.04s]  That's growing and shrinking.
[3089.54s -> 3090.54s]  That's not a blink.
[3096.46s -> 3098.46s]  Just like a typical American dish.
[3098.46s -> 3103.46s]  It's loaded with as much salt as you can physically fucking tolerate.
[3103.96s -> 3111.71s]  There's no wink, liars.
[3121.59s -> 3122.59s]  You're a great chef.
[3122.59s -> 3123.59s]  Hey, thanks.
[3127.33s -> 3129.83s]  Oh, another classic American dish.
[3129.83s -> 3131.33s]  The hot dog.
[3131.83s -> 3136.91s]  Why is classic American food food for toddlers?
[3138.36s -> 3139.86s]  The classic American.
[3140.36s -> 3141.36s]  Hot dog.
[3141.86s -> 3143.36s]  Chopped up a bunch.
[3144.22s -> 3145.22s]  Popcorn.
[3145.72s -> 3147.22s]  Macaroni and cheese.
[3147.72s -> 3154.58s]  Look, we're going to get another thing with an American flag that's like Cheerios.
[3155.08s -> 3157.83s]  And you just have to pick them up like a baby.
[3157.83s -> 3161.33s]  Just eat them one by one on one of those toddler dishes.
[3161.83s -> 3165.54s]  What's a classic American food?
[3166.54s -> 3171.28s]  What's a classic American dish?
[3171.78s -> 3172.78s]  American.
[3175.76s -> 3176.76s]  Apple pie.
[3176.76s -> 3177.76s]  Pies, yeah.
[3177.76s -> 3178.76s]  Desserts.
[3178.76s -> 3181.08s]  Burger.
[3181.08s -> 3182.08s]  I don't know about a burger.
[3182.08s -> 3183.58s]  Isn't burger German?
[3183.58s -> 3185.21s]  Hamburger.
[3185.21s -> 3186.21s]  That's like, that's German, right?
[3186.21s -> 3189.21s]  What's an American cuisine?
[3189.21s -> 3190.21s]  Barbecue, yep.
[3191.21s -> 3193.77s]  Barbecue is, yeah, absolutely.
[3200.55s -> 3201.55s]  Turkey.
[3201.55s -> 3202.55s]  Turkey, barbecue.
[3203.55s -> 3207.99s]  Diner food.
[3207.99s -> 3209.99s]  But that's not like, that's not like...
[3210.99s -> 3217.30s]  Diner food is just a place, that's like a genre of restaurant style.
[3217.30s -> 3219.30s]  That's not like classic American recipe.
[3219.30s -> 3220.30s]  Diner.
[3221.30s -> 3222.30s]  KFC.
[3222.30s -> 3223.30s]  Yeah, I guess so.
[3224.30s -> 3225.66s]  Beer.
[3228.25s -> 3229.25s]  Anything fried?
[3230.68s -> 3231.68s]  Like fried chicken.
[3233.56s -> 3236.56s]  Yeah, but hopefully we get some, hopefully we get like a...
[3239.85s -> 3240.85s]  Beer is German.
[3242.41s -> 3243.41s]  Germany didn't invent beer.
[3244.41s -> 3245.41s]  Who invented beer?
[3254.46s -> 3255.46s]  The Mesopotamians.
[3256.46s -> 3257.46s]  The Mesopotamians invented beer.
[3259.59s -> 3273.50s]  Sorry.
[3273.50s -> 3274.50s]  Vegan?
[3274.50s -> 3275.74s]  Alright, what's this?
[3275.74s -> 3276.74s]  Spaghetti and squid ink.
[3281.59s -> 3291.34s]  Eggs.
[3291.34s -> 3292.34s]  I fucking can't do the eggs.
[3293.34s -> 3294.34s]  Even in fucking fake life.
[3298.40s -> 3302.75s]  Light, light, light, light.
[3303.75s -> 3314.50s]  At the same speed, man.
[3317.51s -> 3318.51s]  Eggcellent, I get it.
[3326.26s -> 3329.26s]  NA doesn't have much distinct because it's all brought from other countries.
[3329.26s -> 3330.26s]  Yeah.
[3330.26s -> 3333.26s]  But, I mean like barbecue, like a smoked barbecue brisket.
[3333.26s -> 3334.26s]  That's pretty American.
[3335.26s -> 3340.34s]  No it isn't.
[3340.34s -> 3341.34s]  What are you talking about?
[3341.34s -> 3348.14s]  If you get smoked barbecue brisket from America, it's going to be better than anywhere else on Earth.
[3349.14s -> 3350.14s]  That's a fact.
[3352.21s -> 3354.21s]  Literally any chef on Earth will tell you that.
[3358.84s -> 3361.84s]  Some of the best chefs in the world will tell you that the best barbecue is in America.
[3362.84s -> 3363.84s]  Of course it is.
[3365.59s -> 3367.59s]  What country does barbecue better than America?
[3368.59s -> 3369.59s]  I'm sorry.
[3369.59s -> 3371.59s]  Like we're like, oh America is popcorn!
[3371.59s -> 3373.59s]  But I'm going to defend America when I need to.
[3373.59s -> 3379.22s]  Like fucking barbecue, American barbecue is better than anywhere else on the planet.
[3379.22s -> 3380.22s]  Like what are you talking about?
[3380.22s -> 3381.22s]  Come on.
[3382.22s -> 3384.03s]  He's a patriot.
[3385.46s -> 3386.46s]  I like eating smoked meat.
[3387.46s -> 3391.90s]  I need the dough.
[3415.76s -> 3416.76s]  We have the best burgers?
[3419.02s -> 3420.02s]  America's got some really good food.
[3421.02s -> 3426.52s]  I mean, yes, you could eat like chicken tenders and like pizza hut every day.
[3427.52s -> 3428.52s]  But like, I mean that's like the joke, right?
[3429.52s -> 3431.52s]  Like Americans, they eat fucking the pizza hut hot dogs and mac and cheese.
[3432.52s -> 3433.52s]  I mean they do.
[3433.52s -> 3434.52s]  We do.
[3434.52s -> 3445.49s]  I do.
[3445.49s -> 3446.49s]  How long does this need to be?
[3446.49s -> 3447.49s]  How long does this need to be?
[3448.49s -> 3452.54s]  Is it too long?
[3452.54s -> 3454.55s]  What was I making?
[3455.55s -> 3458.14s]  What was that?
[3458.14s -> 3459.14s]  I don't even know what that was.
[3463.96s -> 3465.96s]  Oh, it's supposed to be spaghetti.
[3466.96s -> 3470.90s]  That would be one giant tube of spaghetti.
[3471.90s -> 3473.08s]  Okay.
[3473.08s -> 3474.08s]  Make some pasta.
[3474.08s -> 3479.08s]  When the pasta is flowing from the pasta machine, it reaches the length of the line.
[3479.08s -> 3481.08s]  Shake the Wiimote to cut the pasta.
[3482.08s -> 3483.08s]  Alright, so cut it when it gets...
[3485.83s -> 3498.02s]  This looks like fun.
[3498.02s -> 3499.02s]  This looks like fun.
[3499.02s -> 3500.02s]  Is this hard to do?
[3502.73s -> 3503.73s]  Alright, you know why I want to make my own pasta?
[3504.73s -> 3505.73s]  Because you guys remember the Play-Doh play set?
[3506.73s -> 3508.73s]  Where you did the same exact thing except it wasn't pasta.
[3508.73s -> 3509.73s]  It was Play-Doh.
[3510.73s -> 3511.73s]  But it wasn't supposed to be pasta.
[3512.73s -> 3515.73s]  You just smooshed Play-Doh through a machine that turned it into this for no reason.
[3516.73s -> 3517.73s]  That's why I want to make this.
[3523.96s -> 3525.52s]  Childhood.
[3526.52s -> 3530.64s]  Inspiration.
[3531.64s -> 3532.64s]  You grew up at Toys R Us.
[3533.64s -> 3534.64s]  A lot of people did.
[3534.64s -> 3536.64s]  Alright, rotate the Wiimote so we're going to stew this again.
[3537.64s -> 3538.64s]  I've had some experience stewing.
[3546.62s -> 3547.62s]  A little bit of salt.
[3550.71s -> 3555.60s]  Get that heat up.
[3555.60s -> 3556.60s]  More stirring.
[3558.35s -> 3559.35s]  This is just really easy Guitar Hero.
[3563.28s -> 3565.10s]  Stir the pasta.
[3565.10s -> 3566.10s]  Damn it, I did.
[3567.72s -> 3568.72s]  Wonderful.
[3568.72s -> 3569.72s]  Better than mama.
[3570.72s -> 3572.79s]  It had really good...
[3572.79s -> 3573.79s]  Wait, what?
[3573.79s -> 3574.79s]  What was mushy and gross?
[3575.79s -> 3576.79s]  Alright, drain the pasta.
[3577.79s -> 3578.79s]  The whole like this.
[3579.79s -> 3580.79s]  Tilt the pot to drain.
[3581.79s -> 3584.79s]  If you tilt too much, it'll spill and you'll like burn mama's hands again.
[3585.79s -> 3593.69s]  Good job.
[3594.69s -> 3599.58s]  That was it?
[3599.58s -> 3601.58s]  That's all the pasta that was in the fucking bowl?
[3602.58s -> 3603.58s]  What?
[3603.58s -> 3604.58s]  What?
[3606.07s -> 3608.07s]  Get your hand in there and like get it out.
[3609.07s -> 3615.50s]  Prepare.
[3615.50s -> 3617.99s]  Move the Wiimote in the direction of the arrow.
[3618.99s -> 3619.99s]  Prepare the ingredients.
[3628.98s -> 3643.08s]  Ugh!
[3643.08s -> 3644.08s]  It just ripped his head off.
[3644.08s -> 3645.08s]  Wonderful.
[3646.08s -> 3647.08s]  I'm sorry.
[3647.08s -> 3650.08s]  Anything that has a slimy outside...
[3650.08s -> 3652.08s]  I would not ever eat.
[3653.08s -> 3654.08s]  I know, I'm sorry.
[3654.08s -> 3656.08s]  Octopus get disgusting.
[3656.08s -> 3657.08s]  Squid disgusting.
[3658.08s -> 3662.08s]  They're like slimy, tendril aliens?
[3662.08s -> 3663.08s]  No.
[3663.08s -> 3664.08s]  Never.
[3664.08s -> 3665.08s]  I'm sorry.
[3665.08s -> 3666.08s]  I...
[3668.73s -> 3669.73s]  Why would we eat that?
[3670.73s -> 3674.27s]  It's squid.
[3674.27s -> 3675.27s]  It's octopus.
[3675.27s -> 3676.27s]  No.
[3676.27s -> 3677.27s]  No.
[3677.27s -> 3678.27s]  And their legs...
[3678.27s -> 3679.27s]  They have...
[3679.27s -> 3683.27s]  You eat like octopus legs, they have like the suction cups and they're long and they like...
[3684.27s -> 3687.27s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, never.
[3688.27s -> 3691.05s]  Ugh!
[3691.05s -> 3695.94s]  I just like imagine it like...
[3696.94s -> 3698.94s]  Like sucking in my lip and maybe like...
[3698.94s -> 3699.94s]  It's on my lip!
[3699.94s -> 3700.94s]  It's on my fucking lip!
[3700.94s -> 3702.94s]  And like Cam has to reach over and like...
[3702.94s -> 3703.94s]  Pull it off!
[3703.94s -> 3704.94s]  I can't get it off!
[3705.94s -> 3706.94s]  Ugh, no.
[3706.94s -> 3709.14s]  I don't want it.
[3709.14s -> 3723.11s]  I don't want it.
[3723.11s -> 3725.11s]  Why is the squid turned into onion rings when you cut it up?
[3725.11s -> 3726.11s]  No, that's gross.
[3726.11s -> 3727.11s]  Weird.
[3728.11s -> 3729.11s]  Squid when you...
[3729.11s -> 3732.11s]  It's just like little weird slimy wristbands.
[3732.11s -> 3735.11s]  That tape that you chew through like rubber.
[3736.11s -> 3748.36s]  No, you don't...
[3748.36s -> 3749.36s]  Garlic, you're speaking like...
[3749.36s -> 3754.31s]  That's it?
[3754.31s -> 3755.31s]  Alright, yeah, sure, okay.
[3755.31s -> 3757.31s]  I will eat a piece of calamari and be like...
[3757.31s -> 3758.31s]  Oh!
[3759.68s -> 3760.68s]  That's...
[3760.68s -> 3761.68s]  Mmm!
[3761.68s -> 3762.68s]  That was good.
[3762.68s -> 3763.68s]  That was kind of good.
[3763.68s -> 3764.68s]  It was a little salty.
[3765.68s -> 3766.68s]  But when people pick up...
[3767.68s -> 3770.68s]  When people pick up the fucking piece of calamari...
[3771.68s -> 3772.68s]  That's...
[3772.68s -> 3776.68s]  Like when you launch a grenade launcher at an alien in a fucking video game.
[3776.68s -> 3778.68s]  And it's like spread out and all fucking...
[3778.68s -> 3780.68s]  Like it looks like this!
[3780.68s -> 3782.68s]  It looks like that and it's fried up.
[3782.68s -> 3783.68s]  Mmm.
[3783.68s -> 3784.68s]  Nope.
[3784.68s -> 3785.68s]  And it's like the legs are...
[3785.68s -> 3793.51s]  Nope.
[3793.51s -> 3794.51s]  Can't handle squid.
[3794.51s -> 3795.51s]  No, why?
[3795.51s -> 3796.51s]  I just don't eat it.
[3796.51s -> 3797.69s]  I don't want it.
[3797.69s -> 3798.69s]  How long does this take to cook?
[3798.69s -> 3808.35s]  Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright!
[3808.35s -> 3809.35s]  Stop, stop, stop!
[3809.35s -> 3810.35s]  That was the squid ink!
[3810.35s -> 3815.41s]  The taste buds of a child.
[3815.41s -> 3819.41s]  A lot of people don't like fucking squid or octopus.
[3819.41s -> 3829.20s]  Why would you want to eat squid ink?
[3829.20s -> 3834.40s]  That's just something that humans decided they were going to eat because they decided
[3834.40s -> 3837.40s]  that they thought it would be cool to eat it one day.
[3837.40s -> 3839.40s]  Like, what's the point of this?
[3839.40s -> 3847.55s]  It tastes.
[3847.55s -> 3848.55s]  It's tasty.
[3848.55s -> 3849.55s]  I don't...
[3849.55s -> 3850.55s]  I don't agree.
[3850.55s -> 3851.55s]  I've never had it though.
[3853.73s -> 3865.40s]  I'm gonna...
[4029.01s -> 4033.85s]  I'll be back in an hour with the squid.
[4033.85s -> 4038.97s]  No, you know what it is for me?
[4038.97s -> 4039.97s]  Here's what it is.
[4039.97s -> 4041.97s]  It's welcome to our restaurant.
[4041.97s -> 4046.97s]  We put squid ink on this to make it so we can charge that plate of food like 30 more
[4046.97s -> 4047.97s]  dollars.
[4047.97s -> 4049.97s]  That's what it is.
[4049.97s -> 4058.06s]  I'm being scammed.
[4058.06s -> 4061.28s]  I'm being scammed.
[4062.28s -> 4065.84s]  You hate to see people get scammed!
[4065.84s -> 4068.21s]  Let's make some pierogies.
[4068.21s -> 4073.93s]  More egg cracking.
[4073.93s -> 4074.93s]  I'll get it.
[4074.93s -> 4079.56s]  Perfect.
[4079.56s -> 4080.56s]  Just like that.
[4080.56s -> 4083.14s]  Again.
[4083.14s -> 4084.14s]  It was identical.
[4084.14s -> 4086.14s]  Roll that clip back and watch it.
[4086.14s -> 4091.42s]  Where did I go?
[4091.42s -> 4092.42s]  I went to the bathroom.
[4092.42s -> 4096.74s]  Did I tell you I was going to the bathroom?
[4096.74s -> 4103.40s]  Wait, it didn't say where I was going?
[4103.40s -> 4107.18s]  Wait, what are you talking about?
[4107.18s -> 4108.18s]  Oh, it's...
[4108.18s -> 4111.18s]  My voice is delayed by a thousand milliseconds.
[4111.18s -> 4115.42s]  So, when I say something right here, you hear it a full second later.
[4115.42s -> 4116.42s]  So, I said, hey, I'm going to the bathroom.
[4116.42s -> 4117.42s]  Be right back.
[4117.42s -> 4118.42s]  And I muted.
[4118.42s -> 4120.42s]  So, you didn't hear that.
[4120.42s -> 4122.04s]  Oh.
[4122.04s -> 4124.54s]  I muted too quickly for you to get the...
[4124.54s -> 4125.54s]  Okay.
[4125.54s -> 4126.97s]  What do you think about these?
[4126.97s -> 4128.97s]  These are getting long, huh?
[4128.97s -> 4129.97s]  They look nice though.
[4129.97s -> 4131.97s]  Like, they actually are like very healthy nails.
[4131.97s -> 4133.97s]  They're very healthy.
[4133.97s -> 4134.97s]  Too healthy.
[4134.97s -> 4136.97s]  They grow like a wheat.
[4136.97s -> 4141.49s]  I club them once a fucking week and they just keep going.
[4141.49s -> 4149.96s]  What's next?
[4149.96s -> 4150.96s]  All right.
[4150.96s -> 4152.78s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[4152.78s -> 4156.96s]  Put it down.
[4156.96s -> 4157.96s]  Put it down.
[4157.96s -> 4159.26s]  Sell the clippings.
[4159.26s -> 4161.26s]  I can't think of anything more disgusting than what you just said.
[4161.26s -> 4164.26s]  Except for maybe eat squid ink pasta.
[4164.26s -> 4165.26s]  No, no, no.
[4165.26s -> 4166.26s]  Put it down.
[4166.26s -> 4167.26s]  Put it down.
[4167.26s -> 4168.26s]  Put it down.
[4168.26s -> 4177.76s]  Put it down.
[4177.76s -> 4178.76s]  Put it down.
[4178.76s -> 4184.54s]  Put it down.
[4184.54s -> 4185.91s]  Put it down.
[4185.91s -> 4186.91s]  Leave this dough.
[4186.91s -> 4203.94s]  Are we making squid ink pasta again?
[4203.94s -> 4205.94s]  I want his points back.
[4205.94s -> 4209.54s]  Where's the boomer brace?
[4209.54s -> 4211.54s]  I haven't been wearing it lately.
[4211.54s -> 4214.54s]  It's been constricting me and giving me a little sore.
[4214.54s -> 4216.78s]  Oh, let's shape the pierogies.
[4216.78s -> 4218.86s]  Okay.
[4218.86s -> 4220.86s]  They have to shape them.
[4220.86s -> 4222.99s]  Okay.
[4222.99s -> 4229.29s]  Get it?
[4229.29s -> 4230.29s]  When am I done shaping it?
[4230.29s -> 4240.94s]  No, no.
[4240.94s -> 4241.94s]  Other way.
[4241.94s -> 4243.94s]  Other way.
[4243.94s -> 4253.38s]  Stop going the other way.
[4253.38s -> 4254.38s]  You can't go faster than this, guys.
[4254.38s -> 4255.38s]  The snow go faster.
[4256.38s -> 4269.88s]  Why does he look so upset?
[4269.88s -> 4293.43s]  I think that's just my face.
[4293.43s -> 4295.43s]  Rest in boomer face.
[4297.43s -> 4303.54s]  All right.
[4303.54s -> 4304.97s]  Stretch the dough.
[4304.97s -> 4306.97s]  Move it forward and backward to stretch the dough.
[4306.97s -> 4310.14s]  Rotate dough with one and two.
[4310.14s -> 4311.14s]  Okay.
[4311.14s -> 4313.14s]  We're going to spread it out.
[4313.14s -> 4314.14s]  One and two.
[4314.14s -> 4335.48s]  Careful.
[4335.48s -> 4336.48s]  Careful.
[4336.48s -> 4337.48s]  Mm.
[4337.48s -> 4338.48s]  Mm.
[4338.48s -> 4339.48s]  Mm.
[4339.48s -> 4344.24s]  Mm.
[4344.24s -> 4347.08s]  Mm.
[4348.08s -> 4354.06s]  Pierogies are awesome.
[4354.06s -> 4355.06s]  I love pierogies.
[4355.06s -> 4358.26s]  My mother used to make pierogies.
[4358.26s -> 4380.13s]  It looks like too much onion.
[4380.13s -> 4381.13s]  The wiki.
[4385.78s -> 4396.92s]  Why?
[4396.92s -> 4397.92s]  All right.
[4397.92s -> 4399.92s]  Hold it horizontal and move it as though you are turning the handle.
[4399.92s -> 4400.92s]  All right.
[4400.92s -> 4401.92s]  We're going to do the jack in the box.
[4401.92s -> 4418.46s]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[4418.46s -> 4422.82s]  Did you wash your hands before prepping this meal?
[4422.82s -> 4433.63s]  Of course I did.
[4433.63s -> 4434.63s]  Stir fry.
[4434.63s -> 4435.63s]  Add the buttons.
[4435.63s -> 4444.42s]  Get a little salt in there.
[4444.42s -> 4445.42s]  The meat and the pierogies.
[4445.42s -> 4446.86s]  Going to make sure it gets cooked.
[4446.86s -> 4447.86s]  Come on, meat.
[4447.86s -> 4448.86s]  A little bit more.
[4448.86s -> 4449.86s]  A little bit more onion.
[4449.86s -> 4452.38s]  Pierogies.
[4452.38s -> 4453.38s]  We're done.
[4453.38s -> 4454.38s]  Should have left it in there a little longer.
[4454.38s -> 4456.32s]  Now wrap them up.
[4456.32s -> 4463.00s]  Okay.
[4463.00s -> 4467.63s]  So we just have to go.
[4467.63s -> 4468.63s]  Excuse me.
[4468.63s -> 4469.63s]  Where are the gloves?
[4469.63s -> 4471.64s]  Now, I don't eat food prepared by anybody unless they're using rubber cleaning gloves.
[4471.64s -> 4472.64s]  That wasn't a lot of meat.
[4472.64s -> 4475.99s]  This one's, all right.
[4475.99s -> 4476.99s]  This one's a little light.
[4476.99s -> 4484.18s]  All right.
[4484.18s -> 4485.18s]  I know.
[4485.18s -> 4486.18s]  I didn't do enough meat.
[4486.18s -> 4487.18s]  Let's do.
[4487.18s -> 4495.21s]  Okay.
[4495.21s -> 4496.21s]  What are we going to do?
[4496.21s -> 4497.21s]  What are we going to do?
[4497.21s -> 4498.21s]  What are we going to do?
[4498.21s -> 4499.21s]  What are we going to do?
[4500.51s -> 4501.51s]  All right.
[4501.51s -> 4502.51s]  I know.
[4502.51s -> 4503.51s]  I didn't do enough meat.
[4503.51s -> 4504.51s]  Let's do.
[4504.51s -> 4507.16s]  Okay.
[4507.16s -> 4508.16s]  We'll compensate more meat.
[4508.16s -> 4511.13s]  Yeah.
[4511.13s -> 4512.13s]  That's a big.
[4512.13s -> 4513.13s]  That's a hearty one.
[4513.13s -> 4514.13s]  We're just out of the side a little bit.
[4514.13s -> 4515.13s]  It's all right.
[4515.13s -> 4516.13s]  You just tip it upside down.
[4516.13s -> 4517.13s]  You go.
[4517.13s -> 4529.89s]  That's all you need to do.
[4529.89s -> 4531.26s]  Deep fry.
[4531.26s -> 4534.26s]  Grab the ingredients on the tray with the V button and add them to the oil.
[4534.26s -> 4539.26s]  When they're fully cooked, grab with the V button and put them on the bottom tray.
[4558.70s -> 4559.70s]  Do not mind.
[4559.70s -> 4560.70s]  Do not mind.
[4560.70s -> 4561.70s]  Do not mind.
[4561.70s -> 4562.70s]  Wait.
[4562.70s -> 4563.70s]  Did I pick these up?
[4563.70s -> 4564.70s]  All right.
[4564.70s -> 4565.70s]  Turn the heat down.
[4565.70s -> 4566.70s]  That's good.
[4566.70s -> 4567.70s]  Oh, it wasn't.
[4567.70s -> 4568.70s]  They weren't done.
[4568.70s -> 4569.70s]  Do not mind.
[4569.70s -> 4570.70s]  One pierogi.
[4570.70s -> 4572.58s]  They all wasted.
[4572.58s -> 4590.62s]  It seems like you have only one pierogi on your plate, judges.
[4590.62s -> 4591.62s]  Yeah.
[4591.62s -> 4597.37s]  Germa, you just wasted like $40 worth of food.
[4597.37s -> 4605.86s]  Have you ever used a stove before?
[4614.89s -> 4615.89s]  I don't know.
[4615.89s -> 4617.89s]  I've never actually used a stove before.
[4617.89s -> 4619.90s]  Uh, this looks...
[4619.90s -> 4620.90s]  I don't want this.
[4620.90s -> 4621.90s]  It's like tapeworm stew.
[4621.90s -> 4622.90s]  I don't want it.
[4622.90s -> 4623.90s]  Uh, what is that?
[4623.90s -> 4624.90s]  No.
[4624.90s -> 4625.90s]  What is that?
[4625.90s -> 4626.90s]  Lasagna?
[4626.90s -> 4627.90s]  No, no.
[4627.90s -> 4628.90s]  Get rid of it.
[4628.90s -> 4629.90s]  Get rid of it.
[4629.90s -> 4633.10s]  That's not appetizing to me.
[4633.10s -> 4634.10s]  I don't like this.
[4634.10s -> 4636.10s]  It looks like fruit roll-ups.
[4636.10s -> 4638.10s]  Don't want it.
[4638.10s -> 4640.85s]  Hand-fried lobster.
[4640.85s -> 4641.85s]  Parimpuffs.
[4641.85s -> 4642.85s]  Those are awesome.
[4642.85s -> 4644.79s]  What is this?
[4644.79s -> 4647.35s]  Actually, mussels are pretty good.
[4647.35s -> 4649.35s]  I ate mussels once.
[4649.35s -> 4655.39s]  Oh, fuck.
[4655.39s -> 4656.39s]  I didn't look at the instructions.
[4656.39s -> 4661.86s]  They're open.
[4661.86s -> 4662.86s]  They're done.
[4662.86s -> 4673.90s]  I thought when the shell opens, it means it's cooked, right?
[4673.90s -> 4679.73s]  That's what it means?
[4679.73s -> 4680.73s]  Yes.
[4680.73s -> 4683.18s]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[4683.18s -> 4684.18s]  So what was wrong with that?
[4684.18s -> 4685.18s]  The shell opened.
[4685.18s -> 4690.96s]  When they open up, pick them up with B and move them to the tray.
[4690.96s -> 4691.96s]  So what the fuck?
[4691.96s -> 4713.48s]  What are you going to overcook this shit?
[4713.48s -> 4719.11s]  When they open, how is that wrong?
[4719.11s -> 4725.47s]  Food poisoning.
[4729.59s -> 4732.59s]  It said when they pop open, move them to the tray.
[4732.59s -> 4742.54s]  Awesome.
[4742.54s -> 4763.10s]  They're open.
[4763.10s -> 4765.92s]  They're open.
[4765.92s -> 4769.50s]  I did wait.
[4769.50s -> 4771.50s]  It said, take it, please.
[4771.50s -> 4773.77s]  Look.
[4773.77s -> 4775.77s]  Just literally wait for the arrow.
[4775.77s -> 4783.22s]  I did.
[4783.22s -> 4784.22s]  Okay, this one's done.
[4784.22s -> 4785.71s]  This one's done.
[4785.71s -> 4788.14s]  Now this one's done.
[4788.14s -> 4789.14s]  Mine were done, too.
[4789.14s -> 4790.14s]  That's horseshit.
[4790.14s -> 4791.14s]  Mine were done.
[4791.14s -> 4792.14s]  I didn't have an arrow on it.
[4792.14s -> 4793.14s]  Wonderful.
[4793.14s -> 4794.45s]  Better than mama.
[4794.45s -> 4801.78s]  Yeah, my last dish was better than yours, too.
[4801.78s -> 4802.78s]  Yes, they were.
[4802.78s -> 4815.26s]  Don't criticize the streamer.
[4815.26s -> 4830.58s]  Let's mince.
[4830.58s -> 4841.02s]  I love that.
[4841.02s -> 4844.65s]  Play this for me.
[4844.65s -> 4846.65s]  I have a shitload of Wii games back here.
[4846.65s -> 4848.65s]  So I'm enjoying myself.
[4848.65s -> 4860.04s]  I think it's fun.
[4860.04s -> 4862.04s]  Dedicated cooking mama stream.
[4862.04s -> 4873.97s]  I don't like squid.
[4873.97s -> 4878.34s]  Squids are like, I don't like squid beater.
[4878.34s -> 4880.96s]  Oh.
[4880.96s -> 4882.71s]  Oh.
[4882.71s -> 4883.71s]  Oh.
[4883.71s -> 4902.94s]  I think you're ripping off the thing's fucking legs.
[4902.94s -> 4904.94s]  I don't like it.
[4904.94s -> 4907.94s]  I'm never eating meat ever again.
[4907.94s -> 4908.94s]  I don't know.
[4908.94s -> 4910.94s]  It freaks me out sometimes.
[4910.94s -> 4911.94s]  Wonderful.
[4911.94s -> 4914.46s]  Better than mama.
[4914.46s -> 4921.73s]  He's going to puke.
[4921.73s -> 4922.73s]  That's bullshit.
[4922.73s -> 4925.50s]  All right.
[4925.50s -> 4926.50s]  Oh, wait.
[4926.50s -> 4929.60s]  Okay.
[4929.60s -> 4931.22s]  Let's go.
[4931.22s -> 4937.78s]  All done.
[4937.78s -> 4940.23s]  Let's get a couple of good ones.
[4940.23s -> 4943.07s]  All right.
[4943.07s -> 4944.07s]  All right.
[4944.07s -> 4945.07s]  Come on.
[4945.07s -> 4951.56s]  Come on.
[4951.56s -> 4956.51s]  Come on.
[4956.51s -> 4957.51s]  Squid.
[4959.90s -> 4964.70s]  Not in a different...
[4964.70s -> 4967.16s]  What was that?
[4967.16s -> 4975.42s]  Why is it doing this?
[4975.42s -> 4977.30s]  What?
[4977.30s -> 4978.30s]  Oh, shit.
[4978.30s -> 4979.30s]  Okay.
[4979.30s -> 4983.08s]  I got it.
[4983.08s -> 4984.08s]  Is it sake?
[4984.08s -> 4985.08s]  I love sake.
[4985.08s -> 4986.08s]  Sake is great.
[4986.08s -> 4987.08s]  All right.
[4987.08s -> 4989.79s]  Let's make paeyas.
[4989.79s -> 4991.79s]  I'm going to be the paeya, not the paeyas.
[4991.79s -> 4995.80s]  You don't like wrap them up.
[4995.80s -> 4998.49s]  Arrange them as you'd like.
[4998.49s -> 4999.49s]  All right.
[4999.49s -> 5000.49s]  Let's arrange them as we'd like.
[5000.49s -> 5001.49s]  So let's...
[5001.49s -> 5002.49s]  Oh.
[5002.49s -> 5041.09s]  Better than mama.
[5041.09s -> 5042.09s]  What?
[5042.09s -> 5045.31s]  It was fine.
[5045.31s -> 5052.09s]  I did that because you want to get some broth first, and then you pick the stuff off the
[5052.09s -> 5054.09s]  top that you want.
[5054.09s -> 5057.39s]  I make my paeya buffet style.
[5057.39s -> 5064.92s]  Oh, it's delicious when I make it.
[5064.92s -> 5069.18s]  If you ever come over, I'll make it for you.
[5069.18s -> 5070.18s]  It'll be like...
[5070.18s -> 5071.18s]  Oh, yeah.
[5071.18s -> 5075.26s]  And then we'll go have a steak.
[5075.26s -> 5076.26s]  New recipe.
[5076.26s -> 5077.26s]  All right.
[5077.26s -> 5079.90s]  Shrimp and chili sauce.
[5079.90s -> 5084.22s]  That sounds pretty good.
[5084.22s -> 5085.22s]  All right.
[5085.22s -> 5086.22s]  Should I make the cream puffs?
[5086.22s -> 5088.86s]  Wait.
[5088.86s -> 5089.86s]  What else is there?
[5090.86s -> 5094.87s]  How about a good old-fashioned American hot dog?
[5094.87s -> 5098.43s]  Yeah, we got to make some American food.
[5098.43s -> 5102.67s]  I know that there's like a shitload of Europeans in here that are like, ugh.
[5102.67s -> 5119.17s]  Let's watch.
[5119.17s -> 5123.34s]  The sophistication of American cuisine.
[5123.34s -> 5128.90s]  Watch as I use the knife to slice the bread down the middle.
[5128.90s -> 5138.72s]  And watch as I put hot dog into a bun.
[5138.72s -> 5149.66s]  Outside, apparently.
[5149.66s -> 5150.66s]  What the fuck is this?
[5150.66s -> 5159.05s]  How much of this do I have to put on?
[5159.05s -> 5171.38s]  This much cheese on my hot dog.
[5171.38s -> 5182.66s]  Decorate it.
[5182.66s -> 5184.66s]  This is American cuisine.
[5184.66s -> 5190.66s]  Make a hot dog and then be at the fucking Fridays with a placemat as a four-year-old
[5190.66s -> 5193.66s]  and draw with a crayon all over the placemat.
[5193.66s -> 5206.14s]  Oh, this is ketchup and mustard.
[5220.02s -> 5223.02s]  Okay, that's a mustard sandwich?
[5224.02s -> 5229.02s]  With a handle, that's a hot dog.
[5229.02s -> 5232.02s]  You pick that up by the hot dog and eat that.
[5232.02s -> 5250.41s]  That's a reverse corn dog.
[5250.41s -> 5253.90s]  Double cheeseburger, American.
[5253.90s -> 5255.90s]  We're doing all the American stuff first, because I'm American.
[5255.90s -> 5258.90s]  And I'm going to tell you how correct it is.
[5258.90s -> 5259.90s]  This is a double cheeseburger.
[5259.90s -> 5262.40s]  Why does it have to be a double?
[5262.40s -> 5263.40s]  Why does it have to be a double?
[5263.40s -> 5264.40s]  I don't get it.
[5264.40s -> 5267.47s]  Why can it just be one single cheeseburger?
[5267.47s -> 5268.47s]  What are you saying?
[5268.47s -> 5270.47s]  All Americans eat McDouble cheeseburgers?
[5270.47s -> 5273.47s]  McDoubles every time they go to the restaurant?
[5273.47s -> 5277.74s]  You all do.
[5277.74s -> 5280.74s]  When was the last time anyone ordered a single hamburger from McDonald's?
[5280.74s -> 5283.74s]  I mean, like a regular cheeseburger.
[5283.74s -> 5287.30s]  I'm not even sure they make those anymore, because people don't order them.
[5287.30s -> 5292.89s]  That's a special order now to get a single cheeseburger.
[5292.89s -> 5295.89s]  You have to pull around and park in one of the parking spaces,
[5295.89s -> 5297.89s]  because they're not fucking ready for that.
[5297.89s -> 5301.02s]  All right, let's see what we've got.
[5301.02s -> 5303.54s]  What kind of veggies have we got in here?
[5303.54s -> 5305.54s]  I'll tell you how accurate this is.
[5305.54s -> 5309.69s]  Buns.
[5309.69s -> 5310.69s]  Okay.
[5310.69s -> 5311.69s]  Slice the tomato.
[5311.69s -> 5313.69s]  No tomato on mine, please.
[5313.69s -> 5319.70s]  Yes, please give me something that makes everything wet and acidic while I bite into it.
[5319.70s -> 5320.70s]  Disgusting.
[5320.70s -> 5322.70s]  Get it off my hamburger.
[5327.54s -> 5333.32s]  Tear the lettuce.
[5333.32s -> 5334.32s]  Oh, what?
[5334.32s -> 5343.98s]  Did I break my finger?
[5343.98s -> 5350.60s]  Why do we have to do this?
[5350.60s -> 5352.60s]  Why don't we use the pieces?
[5352.60s -> 5354.60s]  Is it like something in the center?
[5354.60s -> 5359.38s]  Can we take all that lettuce off to get to the center of the lettuce?
[5359.38s -> 5361.38s]  Eat the center of the lettuce.
[5361.38s -> 5368.21s]  Make the meat.
[5368.21s -> 5371.21s]  All right, I'm very, very American, because I looked at this and went,
[5371.21s -> 5372.21s]  what the fuck are they talking about?
[5372.21s -> 5377.21s]  Just go to the grocery store, get patty, and put patty in the pan.
[5377.21s -> 5389.78s]  Oh, this is going to make quite a few hamburgers.
[5389.78s -> 5392.78s]  Looks like the whole baseball team is coming over, mama.
[5392.78s -> 5397.08s]  Because this is like 15 hamburgers.
[5400.75s -> 5404.74s]  Eggs.
[5404.74s -> 5405.74s]  Oh, right.
[5405.74s -> 5407.74s]  It's a binder.
[5407.74s -> 5408.74s]  It's a binder.
[5408.74s -> 5423.34s]  More than two or three eggs to make.
[5423.34s -> 5425.34s]  That seems like a lot.
[5427.34s -> 5430.06s]  One hit.
[5431.06s -> 5435.54s]  I messed up one this time.
[5435.54s -> 5437.90s]  Perfect record there.
[5437.90s -> 5439.90s]  Perfect record.
[5443.40s -> 5444.40s]  The burger is not a meatball.
[5444.40s -> 5446.40s]  You sap it.
[5446.40s -> 5448.40s]  Is that the grate the cheese?
[5448.40s -> 5450.40s]  Okay, grate the cheese.
[5450.40s -> 5453.62s]  Like this?
[5453.62s -> 5455.62s]  How does one do it like this?
[5455.62s -> 5456.62s]  Seems weird.
[5456.62s -> 5462.77s]  All right, grate the cheese.
[5483.97s -> 5484.97s]  Do it again.
[5484.97s -> 5487.66s]  Do it every time, and I love it.
[5487.66s -> 5491.66s]  Because the cheese is so soft when you do that.
[5491.66s -> 5496.66s]  If you grate a fresh block of Parmesan, the cheese is so soft
[5496.66s -> 5498.66s]  and almost moist.
[5498.66s -> 5500.66s]  And when you pick it up, it just bunches together.
[5500.66s -> 5501.66s]  And it's so...
[5501.66s -> 5503.66s]  I love Parmesan cheese.
[5503.66s -> 5504.66s]  It's my favorite.
[5504.66s -> 5505.66s]  I love hard cheese.
[5505.66s -> 5506.66s]  I'm a hard cheese guy.
[5506.66s -> 5507.66s]  Not a soft cheese guy.
[5507.66s -> 5509.66s]  Marie sucks.
[5509.66s -> 5510.66s]  Okay?
[5510.66s -> 5511.66s]  Hard cheese, yes.
[5511.66s -> 5513.66s]  Soft cheese, get it out of here.
[5513.66s -> 5516.02s]  I'm a hard cheese guy.
[5516.02s -> 5520.57s]  I'm just telling you how I feel.
[5520.57s -> 5524.43s]  Why is this so dirty?
[5524.43s -> 5526.43s]  Why are there like bugs at the restaurant?
[5526.43s -> 5529.78s]  What's up, Megan?
[5529.78s -> 5531.54s]  What's up, girl?
[5531.54s -> 5534.93s]  Mama, why are you making me guess?
[5534.93s -> 5539.51s]  Mama, I appreciate the fact that you're using one of those old toys
[5539.51s -> 5541.51s]  from the fucking early 90s
[5541.51s -> 5543.51s]  that you take the magnet and give the guy a beard,
[5543.51s -> 5545.51s]  but get it off my screen, please!
[5553.26s -> 5554.26s]  Knead the dough.
[5554.26s -> 5568.91s]  The hamburger dough.
[5568.91s -> 5572.50s]  Knead the hamburger dough.
[5578.01s -> 5579.01s]  All right, make a hamburger.
[5579.01s -> 5582.01s]  Hold the B button to take a piece of hamburger,
[5582.01s -> 5584.01s]  then hold the Limo up right
[5584.01s -> 5586.01s]  and move left and right to shape the meat.
[5586.01s -> 5588.38s]  All right, this is a long one.
[5590.38s -> 5592.38s]  So grab some meat.
[5592.38s -> 5594.38s]  Up right.
[5598.75s -> 5600.75s]  That's not how I've ever done that.
[5600.75s -> 5602.75s]  It seems...
[5602.75s -> 5604.75s]  I'm making a pizza?
[5604.75s -> 5613.07s]  That's not how you do this.
[5614.57s -> 5619.50s]  If my mother ever saw me doing this in the kitchen,
[5619.50s -> 5621.50s]  she would come and grab my arm and be like,
[5621.50s -> 5622.50s]  hey, hey, hey, hey!
[5622.50s -> 5634.42s]  Big patty.
[5634.42s -> 5642.19s]  Why am I playing this?
[5642.19s -> 5644.19s]  Because it's a fun game.
[5644.19s -> 5646.19s]  Because my chibi-robo got fucked up
[5646.19s -> 5648.19s]  because I don't have a...
[5648.19s -> 5649.19s]  I have a corrupted...
[5649.19s -> 5650.19s]  You know what?
[5650.19s -> 5652.19s]  Let's just say I started with this.
[5654.78s -> 5655.78s]  All right, butter time.
[5667.80s -> 5668.80s]  Come on, get it.
[5672.90s -> 5674.90s]  Just forget the first hour of your life here.
[5677.26s -> 5679.26s]  All right, time to pan fry.
[5679.26s -> 5682.26s]  Turn over, move forward and back.
[5682.26s -> 5684.95s]  Shake just a heap.
[5684.95s -> 5686.95s]  Oh, fuck, I have to make the patty.
[5686.95s -> 5690.02s]  Why does it look like this?
[5690.02s -> 5696.62s]  Why is it in half?
[5696.62s -> 5698.62s]  Forward and back to move to flip it.
[5698.62s -> 5701.98s]  Shake it and then adjust the heat while holding A.
[5708.30s -> 5714.94s]  Okay, turn it over.
[5714.94s -> 5715.94s]  Put it on medium.
[5715.94s -> 5721.62s]  Down to low.
[5721.62s -> 5723.62s]  Put the patty over again.
[5723.62s -> 5726.56s]  Put it back on medium heat.
[5726.56s -> 5731.60s]  Flip it over again.
[5731.60s -> 5734.93s]  This is huge!
[5734.93s -> 5736.93s]  Who is this hamburger for?
[5736.93s -> 5738.93s]  This hamburger is a pancake!
[5738.93s -> 5740.93s]  I know who is going to eat this.
[5740.93s -> 5742.93s]  This is a challenge burger.
[5742.93s -> 5744.93s]  This is not a hamburger that you eat in a restaurant.
[5745.93s -> 5748.26s]  Choose freely.
[5750.58s -> 5752.58s]  All right, let's make my ultimate hamburger.
[5752.58s -> 5753.58s]  Are you ready?
[5757.58s -> 5760.58s]  Okay, we're doing cheese down first.
[5760.58s -> 5761.58s]  Then patty.
[5761.58s -> 5763.58s]  Then two slices of cheese.
[5763.58s -> 5765.58s]  Then patty.
[5765.58s -> 5766.58s]  Then lettuce.
[5766.58s -> 5770.44s]  Then the pickles.
[5770.44s -> 5771.44s]  Get them off.
[5771.44s -> 5772.44s]  No, no, no, no.
[5772.44s -> 5773.44s]  I don't like pickles.
[5773.44s -> 5774.44s]  That's it.
[5774.44s -> 5776.44s]  And then where's mayonnaise?
[5776.44s -> 5777.44s]  There's mayo.
[5777.44s -> 5778.44s]  A little bit of mayo and then a little bit of...
[5778.44s -> 5779.44s]  That's done.
[5779.44s -> 5782.34s]  I'm done.
[5782.34s -> 5785.74s]  There were no onions.
[5786.74s -> 5792.92s]  No, I would do some fresh chopped raw onions too.
[5792.92s -> 5795.92s]  Or maybe some cooked caramelized onions if they were available.
[5795.92s -> 5796.92s]  But they were not.
[5796.92s -> 5799.76s]  That's...
[5799.76s -> 5801.76s]  Okay, if there was a little bit of mayonnaise on that
[5801.76s -> 5803.76s]  and there was some caramelized onions,
[5803.76s -> 5805.76s]  I want to eat that right now.
[5805.76s -> 5815.06s]  Wait, I told you if it was caramelized or not caramelized,
[5815.06s -> 5819.15s]  I'd like it either way.
[5819.15s -> 5820.33s]  Or you know what?
[5820.33s -> 5821.33s]  Get...
[5821.33s -> 5822.33s]  Listen to this.
[5822.33s -> 5823.33s]  It was unavailable.
[5823.33s -> 5824.33s]  Get rid of the lettuce.
[5824.33s -> 5825.33s]  Hear me?
[5825.33s -> 5826.33s]  Get rid of the lettuce.
[5826.33s -> 5827.89s]  Mushrooms.
[5827.89s -> 5830.89s]  Sauteed mushrooms on top of that.
[5830.89s -> 5832.77s]  A little bit of fucking...
[5832.77s -> 5836.77s]  A little bit of A1 steak sauce on top of the bun.
[5836.77s -> 5846.38s]  Or...
[5846.38s -> 5847.38s]  Nothing.
[5847.38s -> 5852.78s]  Bad sauce.
[5852.78s -> 5853.78s]  Ew.
[5853.78s -> 5854.78s]  Bad sauce.
[5854.78s -> 5858.45s]  Ew.
[5858.45s -> 5859.45s]  Bad sauce.
[5859.45s -> 5860.45s]  Wait, I just made the...
[5860.45s -> 5862.01s]  I made the...
[5862.01s -> 5863.01s]  I just made that.
[5863.01s -> 5864.01s]  Reversed.
[5864.01s -> 5868.38s]  Washed.
[5868.38s -> 5869.38s]  Oh, this is the blood soup, right?
[5869.38s -> 5870.38s]  I know how to make this.
[5870.38s -> 5871.38s]  Good to you.
[5871.38s -> 5872.38s]  Okay.
[5872.38s -> 5873.38s]  That Hachini.
[5873.38s -> 5876.38s]  I love that Hachini.
[5876.38s -> 5877.38s]  Salisbury steak.
[5877.38s -> 5878.38s]  Can I make the blood soup?
[5878.38s -> 5883.46s]  All right.
[5883.46s -> 5884.46s]  I'm going to make blood soup.
[5884.46s -> 5885.46s]  A1 steak sauce.
[5885.46s -> 5901.62s]  A1 steak sauce.
[5901.62s -> 5902.62s]  Oh, sorry.
[5902.62s -> 5903.62s]  A1 steak sauce.
[5903.62s -> 5906.71s]  Or barbecue sauce.
[5906.71s -> 5907.71s]  Or something very, very dense.
[5907.71s -> 5908.71s]  Or just some Swiss cheese.
[5908.71s -> 5921.86s]  A little bit of mayo.
[5921.86s -> 5922.86s]  Mushroom.
[5922.86s -> 5932.16s]  A mushroom in Swiss hamburger, guys, is incredibly common and very popular.
[5933.16s -> 5935.16s]  I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[5935.16s -> 5940.16s]  A Swiss cheese in mushroom hamburger is on every menu at every restaurant you've ever
[5940.16s -> 5943.16s]  been to that serves more than three different kinds of hamburgers.
[5943.16s -> 5944.98s]  What...
[5944.98s -> 5945.98s]  Where are you guys from?
[5945.98s -> 5946.98s]  Fucking Maz?
[5946.98s -> 5956.42s]  Dude, I'll go even a step further.
[5956.42s -> 5957.42s]  I'll go a step further.
[5957.42s -> 5958.42s]  You want me to go a step further?
[5958.42s -> 5959.42s]  I will.
[5959.42s -> 5967.42s]  I'm one of those guys that I would be totally happy if you gave me just sauteed mushrooms
[5967.42s -> 5968.42s]  with butter.
[5968.42s -> 5971.42s]  I would just eat the fuck out of them.
[5971.42s -> 5975.42s]  Sauteed mushrooms and onions with butter.
[5975.42s -> 5979.62s]  I would just eat that and I would be happy.
[5979.62s -> 5982.99s]  They're so unbelievably delicious.
[5982.99s -> 5987.99s]  Sauteed mushrooms in butter is un-fucking-bearably delicious.
[5987.99s -> 5993.87s]  I can't even imagine somebody that would disagree with that.
[5993.87s -> 5997.87s]  Those of you that get it, imagine like right when you're done sauteing and they're in the
[5997.87s -> 6000.87s]  butter, the mushrooms, and you take that forkful and you just taste it to make sure
[6000.87s -> 6002.87s]  you got it right.
[6002.87s -> 6005.87s]  Imagine not liking that and not thinking that was at the top of the list.
[6005.87s -> 6008.87s]  Can you imagine being that person?
[6008.87s -> 6022.06s]  I'm that guy that sounds awful.
[6022.06s -> 6026.06s]  It's so good.
[6026.06s -> 6030.06s]  Hold on, there's a cattle.
[6030.06s -> 6037.09s]  Mushroom crew.
[6037.09s -> 6044.68s]  He's preaching.
[6044.68s -> 6047.86s]  Beets are okay.
[6047.86s -> 6048.86s]  I don't like to eat beets.
[6048.86s -> 6050.86s]  I like to drink beets.
[6050.86s -> 6054.90s]  They kind of taste like dirt.
[6054.90s -> 6062.37s]  A nice beet salad though, it's okay.
[6062.37s -> 6066.37s]  But beets blended in with another juice or something as a base.
[6066.37s -> 6068.37s]  I like beet juice.
[6068.37s -> 6069.37s]  I think it's okay.
[6069.37s -> 6073.37s]  I'm not a big fan of people that drive by 100 miles per hour by next to the house.
[6073.37s -> 6075.37s]  I'm really not a fan of that.
[6075.37s -> 6085.06s]  How do I feel about borscht?
[6085.06s -> 6087.06s]  I've never had it actually.
[6087.06s -> 6088.06s]  I've never eaten this.
[6088.06s -> 6090.06s]  It looks like it'll be alright.
[6090.06s -> 6094.50s]  Beet salad?
[6094.50s -> 6095.50s]  Yeah, beet salad's good.
[6095.50s -> 6106.68s]  Alright, I'll get this one right now.
[6106.68s -> 6107.68s]  White powder?
[6107.68s -> 6110.68s]  What is white powder?
[6110.68s -> 6111.68s]  White powder?
[6111.68s -> 6114.65s]  What is that?
[6114.65s -> 6117.30s]  What's going on?
[6117.30s -> 6118.30s]  Hello?
[6118.30s -> 6119.30s]  What's going on?
[6119.30s -> 6120.73s]  Why is nothing blinking?
[6120.73s -> 6122.03s]  I have to shake?
[6122.03s -> 6123.03s]  What happened?
[6123.03s -> 6127.32s]  Mama, tell me!
[6127.32s -> 6130.69s]  Mama, tell me what you want!
[6130.69s -> 6132.70s]  Mama!
[6132.70s -> 6135.70s]  You can't just stare at me, Mama!
[6135.70s -> 6136.70s]  Mama!
[6136.70s -> 6137.70s]  Mama!
[6137.70s -> 6139.51s]  It didn't crash?
[6139.51s -> 6141.51s]  The timer's still going.
[6141.51s -> 6145.85s]  This is where Mama goes.
[6145.85s -> 6146.85s]  Oh, sorry.
[6146.85s -> 6149.85s]  She puts her phone down on the fucking table and it's like, Mom!
[6149.85s -> 6158.55s]  Remove the foam.
[6158.55s -> 6164.58s]  Hold the V button while pulling upward and lift the foam?
[6164.58s -> 6179.97s]  What is this, bacteria?
[6179.97s -> 6181.97s]  No, borscht is awesome, Jeremy.
[6181.97s -> 6184.97s]  You just have to remove the mold that cooks off.
[6184.97s -> 6202.42s]  That's fat from the meat?
[6202.42s -> 6205.42s]  I know what it is.
[6205.42s -> 6209.37s]  Thank you for taking the bait.
[6209.37s -> 6210.37s]  Thank you.
[6210.37s -> 6216.90s]  Alright, let's do it.
[6216.90s -> 6226.61s]  He doesn't know.
[6226.61s -> 6229.61s]  I was merely pretending the whole time.
[6229.61s -> 6238.66s]  Can I put this in?
[6238.66s -> 6244.98s]  How about a little bit of this?
[6244.98s -> 6248.69s]  Yeah, some laurel.
[6248.69s -> 6250.99s]  Next goes in the blood.
[6250.99s -> 6252.99s]  Didn't have a blood soup without blood.
[6252.99s -> 6257.69s]  And then the cabbage.
[6257.69s -> 6268.89s]  Where are the beans?
[6268.89s -> 6274.12s]  I said I didn't forget it.
[6277.12s -> 6285.82s]  There's blood in the borscht?
[6285.82s -> 6286.82s]  I'd probably try it.
[6286.82s -> 6293.54s]  It looks like it would be alright.
[6293.54s -> 6295.54s]  This is not even how you make borscht.
[6295.54s -> 6299.19s]  I mean, it's close enough.
[6299.19s -> 6300.19s]  What are those?
[6300.19s -> 6302.19s]  Potato tots?
[6302.19s -> 6306.46s]  Tater tots.
[6306.46s -> 6311.95s]  Tater...
[6311.95s -> 6313.95s]  Chicken kieb.
[6313.95s -> 6315.95s]  Uh, yeah.
[6315.95s -> 6318.13s]  Wait, is this like chicken cordon bleu?
[6318.13s -> 6321.13s]  Is this like a frost filled with ham and chicken and cheese and stuff?
[6321.13s -> 6322.13s]  That was pretty good.
[6322.13s -> 6324.13s]  I like chicken cordon bleu.
[6324.13s -> 6336.16s]  Alright, mince meat.
[6336.16s -> 6338.16s]  I love chicken cordon bleu.
[6338.16s -> 6341.30s]  It's so good.
[6341.30s -> 6343.30s]  This is human skin.
[6343.30s -> 6350.40s]  Why did you say that and why did I read that?
[6350.40s -> 6358.46s]  Butter, salt.
[6358.46s -> 6359.46s]  That was easy.
[6359.46s -> 6362.15s]  It's basically chicken nuggets.
[6369.02s -> 6371.02s]  Aw, damn you, I'm fasting.
[6371.02s -> 6374.75s]  It's supposed to be cheapy, Robo.
[6374.75s -> 6376.75s]  I know, I'm sorry.
[6376.75s -> 6380.36s]  I know.
[6380.36s -> 6384.50s]  It will be tomorrow.
[6384.50s -> 6388.50s]  I will buy like ten different memory cards.
[6388.50s -> 6391.00s]  And an SD card.
[6391.00s -> 6393.00s]  I'll have them all connected at the same time to make sure it works.
[6399.02s -> 6411.62s]  Alright, let's shape it up.
[6411.62s -> 6418.02s]  These are hefty chicken nuggets.
[6418.02s -> 6422.19s]  He's getting disgusting hands all over our chicken nuggets.
[6422.19s -> 6423.19s]  I already winked.
[6423.19s -> 6429.53s]  I just did.
[6429.53s -> 6432.60s]  Oh, that was a big one.
[6432.60s -> 6441.48s]  Wink again.
[6441.48s -> 6448.97s]  These are huge.
[6448.97s -> 6451.97s]  Use your feet to make the nuggets instead of your hands.
[6451.97s -> 6454.98s]  Oh my god.
[6454.98s -> 6456.98s]  This is like a whole breast.
[6456.98s -> 6463.58s]  This is like mom or dad doesn't care anymore.
[6463.58s -> 6464.58s]  Can you make me chicken nuggets?
[6464.58s -> 6466.58s]  Yeah, sure.
[6466.58s -> 6469.66s]  Here.
[6469.66s -> 6470.66s]  Just bite it.
[6470.66s -> 6474.05s]  Just eat it slow.
[6474.05s -> 6476.05s]  Just one super nugget.
[6483.30s -> 6487.96s]  Alright, grate the cheese.
[6487.96s -> 6491.22s]  I'm pretty good at grating cheese at this point.
[6518.58s -> 6520.58s]  Not cheese, by the way.
[6524.14s -> 6526.57s]  Alright, eggs.
[6526.57s -> 6528.57s]  Can't make a chicken kebab without eggs.
[6528.57s -> 6538.23s]  What is she saying?
[6538.23s -> 6541.05s]  Do not what?
[6541.05s -> 6554.41s]  Do not nine?
[6556.41s -> 6559.10s]  What is she saying?
[6562.28s -> 6564.28s]  Do not mind?
[6564.28s -> 6566.28s]  Alright, stir it up.
[6566.28s -> 6568.28s]  Don't go too fast.
[6568.28s -> 6587.80s]  Put that over a hot stove.
[6587.80s -> 6589.80s]  Steam it a little bit.
[6589.80s -> 6591.80s]  Rizzle that on some eggs with some toast.
[6591.80s -> 6593.80s]  You guys sell fucking fake eggs Benedict.
[6593.80s -> 6604.68s]  Try the chicken.
[6604.68s -> 6615.30s]  Alright, this is kind of ridiculous.
[6615.30s -> 6642.95s]  Okay, got it.
[6642.95s -> 6655.75s]  Not done.
[6655.75s -> 6657.75s]  Stop rubbing mold on the chicken nuggets.
[6657.75s -> 6659.75s]  I got a super scroller on that.
[6664.49s -> 6668.33s]  Heat fry.
[6668.33s -> 6670.33s]  When they're fully cooked, grab them with the B button.
[6670.33s -> 6678.46s]  Alright, we're going to do one at a time.
[6678.46s -> 6680.46s]  Three at a time is fine.
[6680.46s -> 6685.51s]  Okay, so let's increase the heat a little bit.
[6685.51s -> 6687.51s]  Over the heat a little.
[6687.51s -> 6693.98s]  Are they done?
[6693.98s -> 6696.28s]  Are these done?
[6700.28s -> 6702.65s]  Oh my god, they're black!
[6702.65s -> 6704.65s]  Turn the heat down.
[6704.65s -> 6706.65s]  I got to get at least one.
[6706.65s -> 6708.65s]  Otherwise the judges are going to fucking kill me.
[6721.27s -> 6732.73s]  Mine didn't look like that.
[6732.73s -> 6734.73s]  These look kind of good.
[6734.73s -> 6737.22s]  I would eat these.
[6737.22s -> 6740.30s]  These actually look pretty good.
[6740.30s -> 6742.30s]  I feel like this would be like cutting into these.
[6742.30s -> 6744.30s]  You get the moist chicken with the crunchy outside.
[6744.30s -> 6746.54s]  What is this over here though?
[6746.54s -> 6749.42s]  What's this moss? What is that?
[6749.42s -> 6751.42s]  I didn't make that.
[6751.42s -> 6758.84s]  New recipe.
[6758.84s -> 6760.84s]  New recipe.
[6760.84s -> 6766.28s]  Beef stroganoff.
[6766.28s -> 6768.28s]  Alright, what did we miss?
[6770.78s -> 6772.78s]  We didn't do shrimp and chili sauce.
[6772.78s -> 6777.51s]  Let's do shrimp and chili sauce.
[6777.51s -> 6789.54s]  Lettuce.
[6789.54s -> 6810.65s]  Can't we just cut it up?
[6810.65s -> 6812.65s]  Prepare. Rip the head off the squid.
[6812.65s -> 6814.65s]  And then dump all of its ink into a bowl.
[6837.94s -> 6839.94s]  Head of the mama, that's good.
[6839.94s -> 6843.00s]  Alright, chop. Chop time.
[6843.00s -> 6849.34s]  He's going to puke again.
[6849.34s -> 6851.34s]  That's a lucky one.
[6851.34s -> 6854.66s]  Right down the middle like that.
[6854.66s -> 6856.66s]  You know one of my favorite snacks was growing up?
[6856.66s -> 6859.16s]  Take a celery stalk.
[6859.16s -> 6861.16s]  Like the boat inside the boat of the celery.
[6863.16s -> 6865.16s]  Cut off the ends right.
[6865.16s -> 6867.16s]  Smear peanut butter down the middle.
[6867.16s -> 6869.16s]  Inside the little crevice inside the boat section.
[6869.16s -> 6871.16s]  I loved it.
[6871.16s -> 6873.16s]  Celery peanut butter into the celery boat.
[6873.16s -> 6880.58s]  That's pretty good. Yeah, no, it is good.
[6880.58s -> 6882.58s]  It's a good snack.
[6889.80s -> 6892.36s]  That's a boomer snack.
[6892.36s -> 6894.36s]  It's peanut butter and celery.
[6894.36s -> 6899.35s]  What, you guys don't like peanut butter?
[6899.35s -> 6901.35s]  I don't even know what to do.
[6901.35s -> 6904.04s]  What is this?
[6904.04s -> 6918.31s]  Ginger?
[6918.31s -> 6920.31s]  The zoomers only exist on a diet of uber eats.
[6933.05s -> 6935.05s]  Okay, drop in the oil.
[6935.05s -> 6946.63s]  Alright, when the oil reaches the
[6946.63s -> 6948.63s]  correct temperature, add ingredients.
[6948.63s -> 6951.13s]  Pilt them to coat them in the oil.
[6951.13s -> 6953.13s]  Quickly coat twice
[6953.13s -> 6965.16s]  then finish.
[6965.16s -> 6971.18s]  What? Quickly coat them twice
[6971.18s -> 6973.18s]  and then pull them out.
[6973.18s -> 6975.48s]  Quickly coat twice and then finish.
[6975.48s -> 6977.72s]  I'm just, okay,
[6977.72s -> 6979.72s]  look, it may have been raw, but I'm following the direction.
[6979.72s -> 6982.92s]  If that was on the back
[6982.92s -> 6984.92s]  of like the blue apron
[6984.92s -> 6986.92s]  card, quickly coat
[6986.92s -> 6988.92s]  twice and then take them out.
[6988.92s -> 6990.92s]  I'd be like, okay, idiot, I just follow
[6990.92s -> 6992.92s]  the instructions. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[6992.92s -> 6998.04s]  Alright, sorry, I can cook them right here.
[6998.04s -> 7004.06s]  They're gonna cook right here
[7004.06s -> 7006.06s]  anyway. We'll put them in for a little bit longer.
[7006.06s -> 7015.59s]  There we go, and that chili sauce.
[7015.59s -> 7019.82s]  Alright.
[7019.82s -> 7021.82s]  Come on, shrimp. They cooked in here.
[7021.82s -> 7023.82s]  That's fine. Why'd I have to cook them twice?
[7028.42s -> 7033.54s]  I'm gonna mix squid ink in with your peanut butter.
[7033.54s -> 7044.62s]  Did he ever apologize to
[7044.62s -> 7046.62s]  Mama? Yeah, like two hours ago.
[7046.62s -> 7048.62s]  Where have you been?
[7048.62s -> 7050.62s]  Was that crab?
[7050.62s -> 7052.62s]  Ooh, I like crab.
[7052.62s -> 7056.52s]  What is this?
[7059.34s -> 7061.96s]  Stir-fried crab.
[7061.96s -> 7063.96s]  Oh, stir-fried crab.
[7063.96s -> 7066.20s]  Let me try this.
[7066.20s -> 7068.89s]  Stir-fried crab.
[7068.89s -> 7070.89s]  I love crab.
[7074.41s -> 7078.63s]  This went from
[7078.63s -> 7080.63s]  it's a chibi-robo stream to everybody
[7080.63s -> 7082.63s]  get hungry watching me play
[7082.63s -> 7084.63s]  a 20-year-old cooking game.
[7097.11s -> 7099.11s]  Stir-fried crab.
[7099.11s -> 7101.93s]  I don't want that.
[7103.93s -> 7105.93s]  What is such a fun system? What a fun system
[7105.93s -> 7107.93s]  this was. I wish the memory card worked.
[7107.93s -> 7111.19s]  Sorry, we're past it.
[7111.19s -> 7113.19s]  Alright, shake the Wii mode up and down
[7113.19s -> 7115.19s]  to chop the ingredients.
[7115.19s -> 7122.60s]  Damn, that's it.
[7122.60s -> 7126.57s]  This is chunky.
[7133.93s -> 7136.94s]  The SD card will work.
[7136.94s -> 7138.94s]  I'll make sure this is ready to go.
[7138.94s -> 7140.94s]  I'll make sure of it by tomorrow.
[7140.94s -> 7142.94s]  Alright, cut the pieces.
[7142.94s -> 7144.94s]  A lot of ginger.
[7144.94s -> 7146.94s]  It is kind of a lot of ginger.
[7146.94s -> 7148.94s]  Whoa, alright.
[7148.94s -> 7157.64s]  Turn all the legs off.
[7157.64s -> 7169.74s]  Alright, come on. Now what? That's it?
[7169.74s -> 7173.64s]  This kills the crab.
[7175.64s -> 7177.64s]  No. No.
[7177.64s -> 7181.27s]  I don't think so.
[7181.27s -> 7183.27s]  What are you talking? Alright.
[7183.27s -> 7189.16s]  Same thing. Oil.
[7189.16s -> 7191.16s]  Coat them in the oil. Quickly coat them
[7191.16s -> 7203.77s]  twice and then finish.
[7203.77s -> 7213.05s]  Ow! What?
[7213.05s -> 7215.05s]  You can't cook a fucking crab like
[7215.05s -> 7217.05s]  that. You don't just put it
[7217.05s -> 7219.05s]  in hot oil and take it
[7219.05s -> 7223.46s]  out.
[7223.46s -> 7226.09s]  That's not how you make food.
[7226.09s -> 7228.09s]  You just wasted an entire crab. That crab
[7228.09s -> 7230.09s]  was probably like $140.
[7230.09s -> 7247.30s]  It's not that expensive.
[7247.30s -> 7249.30s]  Crab meat's cheap. Well, it depends on what kind of
[7249.30s -> 7251.86s]  crab this is.
[7251.86s -> 7253.86s]  What is this? Is this crab? Blue crab?
[7253.86s -> 7255.86s]  Snow crab? King crab?
[7255.86s -> 7263.86s]  It depends on what kind of crab
[7263.86s -> 7265.86s]  this is. You can get all kinds of expensive
[7265.86s -> 7268.81s]  crabs. It's the pay attention
[7268.81s -> 7274.70s]  crab. Ah.
[7274.70s -> 7280.26s]  Soy sauce. We're going next.
[7280.26s -> 7282.70s]  Oyster sauce.
[7282.70s -> 7285.32s]  And potato
[7285.32s -> 7293.77s]  starch. This looks really good.
[7293.77s -> 7300.94s]  Serve as much
[7300.94s -> 7303.43s]  as you'd like. Oh, alright. Let's serve
[7303.43s -> 7305.93s]  it. I mean serve as much as you
[7305.93s -> 7320.78s]  like. Wait, no. How do I
[7320.78s -> 7324.55s]  let's put them back together?
[7324.55s -> 7326.55s]  Where are the vegetables?
[7326.55s -> 7345.48s]  Where are the vegetables?
[7345.48s -> 7347.48s]  No shit! I was trying to serve it. I was
[7347.48s -> 7350.87s]  gonna make my own crab with the
[7350.87s -> 7352.87s]  I was gonna make a fake crab with the tomato
[7352.87s -> 7368.42s]  as a head. Crab
[7368.42s -> 7372.01s]  and two cherry tomatoes.
[7372.01s -> 7374.01s]  That's a lot of crab though. You wouldn't be
[7374.01s -> 7376.01s]  complaining.
[7376.01s -> 7384.18s]  Alright, let's go back here.
[7386.18s -> 7388.18s]  Mapo tofu.
[7388.18s -> 7390.55s]  Beef stroganoff.
[7390.55s -> 7392.86s]  Let's get it.
[7392.86s -> 7394.86s]  Go back to American food. There's only been two.
[7394.86s -> 7397.16s]  There's only been two American foods.
[7397.16s -> 7404.97s]  Just wait till we get the accurate
[7404.97s -> 7406.97s]  like 3 a.m. Captain Crunch.
[7408.97s -> 7411.53s]  Popcorn, hot dog, and hamburger.
[7411.53s -> 7416.71s]  Alright, mama, don't fuck this up.
[7416.71s -> 7442.31s]  Popcorn, hot dog, hamburger.
[7442.31s -> 7444.31s]  Yeah, why is the American food the stuff
[7444.31s -> 7446.31s]  that you could order at a baseball game?
[7446.31s -> 7450.73s]  That's where it ends.
[7450.73s -> 7456.17s]  Alright, let's mince.
[7456.17s -> 7471.96s]  Good.
[7471.96s -> 7473.96s]  They should have you make apple pie.
[7473.96s -> 7475.96s]  How many recipes are even in this game?
[7475.96s -> 7477.96s]  Are there a lot of recipes in the game?
[7477.96s -> 7480.58s]  How many recipes are in the game?
[7482.58s -> 7502.47s]  You making a PC?
[7502.47s -> 7504.47s]  No, there's no RAM here.
[7504.47s -> 7506.47s]  There's no RAM here, man.
[7508.47s -> 7510.47s]  There's every single dish ever made.
[7510.47s -> 7524.42s]  Nice.
[7526.42s -> 7529.18s]  So unhealthy.
[7529.18s -> 7531.18s]  Cooking with a bunch of butter in the pan.
[7531.18s -> 7533.18s]  So unhealthy.
[7533.18s -> 7535.18s]  Use avocado oil, idiot.
[7535.18s -> 7551.54s]  Wink.
[7551.54s -> 7554.30s]  Get a little salt on there. Get some wine.
[7554.30s -> 7556.30s]  Get some pepper on there.
[7556.30s -> 7558.30s]  Quickly, quickly, quickly.
[7558.30s -> 7580.95s]  Stew.
[7580.95s -> 7584.79s]  A lot of stews in this game.
[7584.79s -> 7586.79s]  Where's the fucking, where's the pizza?
[7586.79s -> 7588.79s]  Alright, add salt.
[7588.79s -> 7599.67s]  Add milk for a baby.
[7599.67s -> 7610.30s]  Bondu.
[7610.30s -> 7616.06s]  It's a little heavy on the onion, but
[7616.06s -> 7618.81s]  karma looks like a basement dweller.
[7618.81s -> 7624.81s]  Well, I'm not in a basement dweller.
[7624.81s -> 7628.39s]  I'm in an office.
[7628.39s -> 7630.39s]  Come on.
[7630.39s -> 7632.39s]  Beef stroganoff.
[7632.39s -> 7634.39s]  That looks pretty good.
[7641.16s -> 7644.42s]  Now, have I done them all?
[7644.42s -> 7646.42s]  Wait, I didn't do Salisbury Steak.
[7646.42s -> 7648.42s]  You know, of all the
[7648.42s -> 7650.42s]  foods in the world, I've
[7650.42s -> 7652.42s]  never eaten Salisbury Steak.
[7652.42s -> 7654.42s]  But every time I see it, I want it.
[7654.42s -> 7656.98s]  It looks so
[7656.98s -> 7658.98s]  delicious and yummy and
[7658.98s -> 7660.98s]  full of flavor. I want it so bad, but I've never
[7660.98s -> 7662.98s]  had it before. I see it all the time
[7662.98s -> 7666.70s]  and I want it.
[7666.70s -> 7668.70s]  I feel like I would really like it. Let's see what's
[7668.70s -> 7677.72s]  in it. It's a burger with sauce?
[7677.72s -> 7679.72s]  I would probably like it.
[7684.41s -> 7687.10s]  It's like a weird read between
[7687.10s -> 7689.10s]  hamburger and meatloaf.
[7689.10s -> 7691.10s]  I would probably really like it.
[7691.10s -> 7693.10s]  Let's see.
[7693.10s -> 7695.10s]  I'll tell you at the end if I eat it.
[7702.86s -> 7704.86s]  It's high in sodium, but it's really good.
[7704.86s -> 7711.26s]  Mushroom gravy.
[7711.26s -> 7713.26s]  Wait, there's mushrooms on here.
[7713.26s -> 7716.33s]  Are there sauteed mushrooms on a Salisbury
[7716.33s -> 7722.28s]  Steak? Yes.
[7722.28s -> 7727.53s]  Why have I not eaten my favorite food yet?
[7727.53s -> 7733.74s]  This is probably my favorite food.
[7735.74s -> 7737.74s]  Sauteed mushrooms. It's like a hamburger
[7737.74s -> 7739.74s]  with gravy and sauce on it.
[7741.74s -> 7750.38s]  Try it.
[7750.38s -> 7752.38s]  I'll get it next time I haven't.
[7752.38s -> 7754.38s]  Wait, you can't order this.
[7754.38s -> 7760.07s]  Where do you get Salisbury Steak?
[7760.07s -> 7762.07s]  You can't order it at a restaurant.
[7762.07s -> 7765.40s]  I have to make it
[7765.40s -> 7767.40s]  myself? I'm not very good at that.
[7767.40s -> 7770.73s]  No, I'm not going to get the one that's in the frozen
[7770.73s -> 7772.73s]  food section. No. I want a real one.
[7772.73s -> 7780.58s]  At a diner. What
[7780.58s -> 7785.83s]  is this?
[7785.83s -> 7787.83s]  Egg, okay.
[7787.83s -> 7789.83s]  Breadcrumbs.
[7789.83s -> 7792.14s]  Pepper.
[7792.14s -> 7794.14s]  Nutmeg.
[7794.14s -> 7798.28s]  At a diner?
[7798.28s -> 7800.28s]  It's at Southern Shit Diners.
[7802.28s -> 7815.34s]  Hey, where do I get Salisbury
[7815.34s -> 7817.34s]  Steak? Oh, at a Southern Shit
[7817.34s -> 7819.34s]  Diner.
[7819.34s -> 7821.34s]  Let me look that up on Yelp
[7821.34s -> 7823.34s]  and see what it's got for reviews.
[7823.34s -> 7833.43s]  God damn it.
[7833.43s -> 7846.55s]  Salisbury Steak.
[7846.55s -> 7850.97s]  I want this though. What is this part?
[7850.97s -> 7852.97s]  What's this right here?
[7852.97s -> 7856.23s]  What is that? Is that supposed to be like a
[7856.23s -> 7858.23s]  cheese or is that another meat?
[7858.23s -> 7860.79s]  Is that the cheese with the wax on it?
[7860.79s -> 7864.06s]  That's salmon?
[7864.06s -> 7866.06s]  Oh, why would that be in Salisbury Steak?
[7866.06s -> 7868.06s]  You told me it was sauteed mushrooms and meatloaf.
[7868.06s -> 7870.06s]  You didn't say there was a crab shell on here.
[7870.06s -> 7873.06s]  Alright, make the
[7873.06s -> 7892.89s]  hamburger. Dragon fruit.
[7892.89s -> 7894.89s]  Are you talking? Why would they be dragon fruit
[7894.89s -> 7916.14s]  in this?
[7916.14s -> 7918.14s]  I just saw myself in the fucking webcam.
[7918.14s -> 7920.14s]  I didn't like that. That's fucking
[7920.14s -> 7928.65s]  weird. Okay, spread the
[7928.65s -> 7930.65s]  butter. Alright, we're getting to
[7930.65s -> 7932.65s]  that next step coming up here.
[7932.65s -> 7934.82s]  Like the salmon.
[7934.82s -> 7937.19s]  See, this doesn't go in the oven.
[7937.19s -> 7939.43s]  I always thought that Salisbury Steak
[7939.43s -> 7950.76s]  was the thing you made in the oven.
[7950.76s -> 7952.76s]  No.
[7952.76s -> 7955.38s]  He doesn't know?
[7955.38s -> 7959.03s]  Fucking egg.
[7959.03s -> 7961.72s]  What?
[7961.72s -> 7963.72s]  Is eggs on here?
[7963.72s -> 7966.92s]  Shake to shake it and then
[7966.92s -> 7968.92s]  yeah, mix it. Hold the Wii mode upright and turn it around
[7968.92s -> 7970.92s]  while holding B and then A is salt.
[7970.92s -> 7972.92s]  You cook eggs?
[7981.24s -> 7988.52s]  Those look good.
[7988.52s -> 7991.40s]  Those look
[7991.40s -> 7993.40s]  good.
[7993.40s -> 8004.65s]  Let's make the big pie.
[8004.65s -> 8012.95s]  Turn it. Medium heat.
[8012.95s -> 8016.09s]  Sear it on one side.
[8016.09s -> 8018.84s]  Look at the loaf. Spin it.
[8018.84s -> 8023.19s]  I know what this smells like too.
[8023.19s -> 8025.69s]  Like if I lean
[8025.69s -> 8027.69s]  in and just put my face over the screen, like I
[8027.69s -> 8030.50s]  could smell that.
[8030.50s -> 8033.06s]  Oh, that smells so good.
[8033.06s -> 8035.69s]  Especially the mushrooms
[8035.69s -> 8037.69s]  scent in there.
[8037.69s -> 8039.69s]  Oh, it smells so good.
[8039.69s -> 8041.69s]  Smell-O-Vision. Alright, make some
[8041.69s -> 8043.69s]  decorative cuts.
[8043.69s -> 8047.34s]  Where's the mushrooms?
[8047.34s -> 8050.79s]  Why is there a fucking
[8050.79s -> 8052.79s]  decorative hot dog?
[8052.79s -> 8064.62s]  I would pick that off
[8064.62s -> 8066.62s]  the plate and like set
[8066.62s -> 8068.62s]  it slowly aside next
[8068.62s -> 8071.29s]  to me. Off the plate.
[8071.29s -> 8073.29s]  I wouldn't, I don't, I wouldn't want to eat that.
[8073.29s -> 8075.78s]  Alright, serve as much as you'd like.
[8075.78s -> 8080.71s]  Okay, what is this?
[8080.71s -> 8102.07s]  Happy birthday.
[8102.07s -> 8109.24s]  You can just put as many
[8109.24s -> 8111.24s]  as you want. Why?
[8111.24s -> 8113.67s]  What is this? What is this?
[8113.67s -> 8116.68s]  Dessert? Hold on, wait,
[8116.68s -> 8140.17s]  wait. Yes, I ordered the sauce
[8140.17s -> 8142.73s]  for a steak. Oh, okay, sure.
[8142.73s -> 8144.73s]  Oh yeah, this is a dozen
[8144.73s -> 8147.54s]  eggs. And
[8147.54s -> 8149.54s]  this really flogs that we've been in the fridge
[8149.54s -> 8156.52s]  since last Wednesday. Wait,
[8156.52s -> 8162.54s]  where are the mushrooms? What is that?
[8162.54s -> 8166.18s]  Sausages?
[8166.18s -> 8168.94s]  What is that? Sausages.
[8168.94s -> 8172.39s]  Yup, let's go.
[8172.39s -> 8174.39s]  Grate the cheese. Do we make
[8174.39s -> 8176.57s]  the links? Do we actually make them?
[8176.57s -> 8178.57s]  Not everything needs to have mushrooms
[8178.57s -> 8180.57s]  you spore snorter.
[8182.87s -> 8185.37s]  The thing is, I don't, I only
[8185.37s -> 8187.37s]  like the, okay, I don't know much
[8187.37s -> 8189.37s]  about mushrooms. I just know the one that I like.
[8189.37s -> 8191.37s]  I like the
[8191.37s -> 8194.44s]  the ones you just buy
[8194.44s -> 8196.44s]  at the grocery store that are just sitting there
[8196.44s -> 8198.44s]  that are in the package.
[8198.44s -> 8200.44s]  What are they? Portobello?
[8200.44s -> 8202.44s]  I don't like it. That's the only one I like.
[8202.44s -> 8208.20s]  The grocery
[8208.20s -> 8211.53s]  store ones.
[8211.53s -> 8213.53s]  The ones that are already chopped up
[8213.53s -> 8215.53s]  that are in the little package with the plastic on
[8215.53s -> 8217.53s]  top. And there's like 700 of them lined up.
[8217.53s -> 8219.53s]  The grocery store mushroom.
[8219.53s -> 8234.76s]  Colorado? They look
[8234.76s -> 8236.76s]  like a white, like they're white.
[8236.76s -> 8242.50s]  They're white.
[8242.50s -> 8246.60s]  They're white button mushrooms.
[8246.60s -> 8248.60s]  They're not portobello. They're called button mushrooms.
[8248.60s -> 8252.31s]  3D printed
[8252.31s -> 8255.83s]  mushrooms.
[8255.83s -> 8257.83s]  Why does this stream have 6,000
[8257.83s -> 8259.83s]  viewers?
[8259.83s -> 8261.83s]  I don't know.
[8261.83s -> 8265.46s]  Why does this stream
[8265.46s -> 8268.02s]  have 10 viewers? What are you doing
[8268.02s -> 8271.74s]  here? What are you doing
[8271.74s -> 8278.07s]  here? Is this seaweed?
[8278.07s -> 8281.38s]  Parsley.
[8281.38s -> 8283.38s]  Because your face came to the zone.
[8283.38s -> 8285.94s]  Why do I believe that?
[8285.94s -> 8290.09s]  Not bad, not bad.
[8290.09s -> 8292.58s]  Alright, need the sausages.
[8292.58s -> 8294.58s]  I want to put them in the casing.
[8294.58s -> 8296.58s]  Is it natural casing?
[8296.58s -> 8298.58s]  Okay, a lot of times
[8298.58s -> 8300.58s]  you go to the store or you find sausages
[8300.58s -> 8302.58s]  Oh, natural casing.
[8302.58s -> 8304.58s]  All natural casing.
[8304.58s -> 8306.58s]  Right? What is
[8306.58s -> 8308.58s]  unnatural casing? What is that?
[8308.58s -> 8314.26s]  Plastic.
[8314.26s -> 8316.26s]  Natural casing
[8316.26s -> 8318.26s]  is like intestines
[8318.26s -> 8320.26s]  or something. What is unnatural casing?
[8320.26s -> 8322.26s]  It's an edible plastic?
[8322.26s -> 8324.26s]  Why would anybody eat edible plastic?
[8324.26s -> 8326.26s]  Why would you ever buy that?
[8326.26s -> 8328.57s]  Why would you even make it like that?
[8328.57s -> 8335.29s]  Plastic? It's cheaper.
[8335.29s -> 8339.51s]  Okay, hold the B button to add minced
[8339.51s -> 8341.51s]  meat. Careful not to tear the skin
[8341.51s -> 8343.51s]  then tilt the Wii mode to twist the sausage
[8343.51s -> 8347.22s]  into links. Is this natural
[8347.22s -> 8357.98s]  casing, mama? I'm trying
[8357.98s -> 8359.98s]  to- I'm tilting the Wii mode.
[8359.98s -> 8365.48s]  How do I cut it?
[8365.48s -> 8368.04s]  How do I tear it?
[8368.04s -> 8378.90s]  Okay, got it. Just one
[8378.90s -> 8390.87s]  huge sausage.
[8390.87s -> 8393.62s]  Okay, I messed up one casing.
[8393.62s -> 8395.62s]  All right, throw it in a stew. That's how you make everything
[8395.62s -> 8397.62s]  in this game. You just boil it.
[8397.62s -> 8411.64s]  Eat on high.
[8411.64s -> 8413.64s]  Boil. Wink. I just did.
[8413.64s -> 8421.06s]  It's just sausages. There's nothing
[8421.06s -> 8423.30s]  else there. This is a house of
[8423.30s -> 8426.18s]  dish.
[8426.18s -> 8430.66s]  There's no seasoning.
[8430.66s -> 8432.66s]  Just sausages? That's it?
[8432.66s -> 8437.14s]  It's like some kind of ground up
[8437.14s -> 8439.14s]  stone mustard and lettuce.
[8439.14s -> 8442.79s]  There's nothing else in here. There was no seasoning or anything.
[8442.79s -> 8448.62s]  It's just boiled
[8448.62s -> 8454.31s]  hot dogs. New recipe.
[8454.31s -> 8456.31s]  This one's from England.
[8456.31s -> 8458.31s]  What's it? English food. Okay.
[8460.81s -> 8462.81s]  Fish and chips! Yep.
[8462.81s -> 8484.15s]  What's it gonna be?
[8484.15s -> 8489.59s]  Toast sandwich?
[8493.59s -> 8495.59s]  What does toast sandwich mean?
[8499.74s -> 8501.74s]  UK food is toast.
[8501.74s -> 8504.68s]  Toast? That's it?
[8504.68s -> 8509.35s]  That's all they eat in
[8509.35s -> 8512.17s]  England is toast.
[8512.17s -> 8514.17s]  Toast and beans.
[8518.97s -> 8521.72s]  Toast and beans. I actually like
[8521.72s -> 8524.02s]  that. I like
[8524.02s -> 8526.02s]  those. I like English beans.
[8526.02s -> 8536.58s]  Slow down! Slow!
[8536.58s -> 8575.74s]  Toast.
[8575.74s -> 8579.64s]  Eat in England.
[8579.64s -> 8581.64s]  He toasts sandwich.
[8581.64s -> 8583.64s]  They just eat toast.
[8583.64s -> 8588.38s]  That was pretty funny.
[8588.38s -> 8593.56s]  That was funny.
[8593.56s -> 8595.56s]  Toast.
[8597.56s -> 8599.56s]  He needs to do
[8599.56s -> 8601.99s]  manscaping?
[8601.99s -> 8605.13s]  Relax! Where?
[8605.13s -> 8616.57s]  Do I have chest hairs?
[8616.57s -> 8620.09s]  Alright, let's make the fish.
[8620.09s -> 8622.09s]  What the fuck? This is not...
[8622.09s -> 8624.09s]  I killed him! I killed him!
[8627.67s -> 8629.67s]  Your counter's too small for this,
[8629.67s -> 8631.67s]  mama. I'm not gonna filet
[8631.67s -> 8633.67s]  an entire swordfish
[8633.67s -> 8635.67s]  in my home kitchen.
[8635.67s -> 8637.67s]  Oh my goodness.
[8637.67s -> 8641.06s]  I thought it was a cob.
[8643.24s -> 8645.67s]  Isn't it like haddock or cod
[8645.67s -> 8647.67s]  for fish and chips?
[8647.67s -> 8659.58s]  This is an expensive fish and chips.
[8659.58s -> 8670.58s]  Swordfish.
[8670.58s -> 8672.58s]  Why would you fry
[8672.58s -> 8674.58s]  swordfish? Hold on.
[8674.58s -> 8676.58s]  Why would you fry swordfish?
[8676.58s -> 8679.46s]  That's not gonna cook.
[8679.46s -> 8682.79s]  That's gonna be fucked.
[8682.79s -> 8684.79s]  You don't put swordfish
[8684.79s -> 8687.80s]  in a fryer later.
[8687.80s -> 8689.80s]  It's too thin. You can't do that.
[8689.80s -> 8694.60s]  You don't cook
[8694.60s -> 8699.08s]  swordfish like this?
[8699.08s -> 8701.08s]  Hey, what are you doing? I'm waiting for the blink.
[8701.08s -> 8709.85s]  I didn't even move, mama.
[8709.85s -> 8711.85s]  Mama, I didn't even fucking move.
[8711.85s -> 8730.79s]  Fish and chips with swordfish.
[8734.79s -> 8736.79s]  This would be kinda gross.
[8736.79s -> 8739.80s]  I don't know if this would work.
[8748.25s -> 8762.71s]  Have you had swordfish before?
[8762.71s -> 8764.89s]  Yeah.
[8764.89s -> 8766.89s]  I like swordfish.
[8766.89s -> 8768.89s]  It's really easy to mess it up though.
[8768.89s -> 8771.51s]  Swordfish is like hard to cook.
[8771.51s -> 8774.07s]  Deep fry it.
[8774.07s -> 8780.47s]  This is wrong.
[8792.17s -> 8794.17s]  Take it easy.
[8794.17s -> 8796.17s]  You're not mine.
[8796.17s -> 8798.17s]  That was like $40 gone.
[8798.17s -> 8807.64s]  Take it out!
[8807.64s -> 8811.86s]  Watch that heat.
[8811.86s -> 8820.38s]  I'm trying to take it out of the
[8820.38s -> 8822.38s]  bow.
[8822.38s -> 8852.82s]  What is this, potatoes?
[8852.82s -> 8854.82s]  You're gonna get punched.
[8860.07s -> 8867.11s]  Good job.
[8867.11s -> 8869.11s]  I was hitting the fucking side.
[8869.11s -> 8873.98s]  Shadow streamer.
[8873.98s -> 8875.98s]  Yeah, I know, I'm in the truck and
[8875.98s -> 8877.98s]  dark.
[8877.98s -> 8879.98s]  We lost to fish and chips.
[8879.98s -> 8883.62s]  Oh, mega lulz.
[8883.62s -> 8885.86s]  America! The United
[8885.86s -> 8887.86s]  States of America!
[8887.86s -> 8889.86s]  What's on tap from our favorite dish?
[8889.86s -> 8902.98s]  I think it's a little further
[8902.98s -> 8931.08s]  south. I mean, I love
[8931.08s -> 8933.26s]  tacos. Tacos, burritos,
[8933.26s -> 8935.26s]  some of my favorite foods in the
[8935.26s -> 8937.62s]  world. But,
[8937.62s -> 8939.86s]  um, like, George Washington
[8939.86s -> 8943.51s]  didn't make it up.
[8943.51s -> 8955.74s]  I need it.
[8955.74s -> 8957.74s]  Yes, he did. Oh, yeah.
[8957.74s -> 8959.74s]  One of my favorite things George Washington, Ben
[8959.74s -> 8961.74s]  Franklin, one of my favorite things he invented
[8961.74s -> 8963.74s]  was the burrito.
[8963.74s -> 8972.89s]  Are you cooking, are you playing this on 3DS?
[8972.89s -> 8978.44s]  Yes.
[8978.44s -> 8994.44s]  Yes. You don't want to be that big,
[8994.44s -> 8998.28s]  right? That's good, that's good, that's good too much.
[8998.28s -> 9001.74s]  And then you sprinkle all the fucking ingredients
[9001.74s -> 9003.74s]  in there, get them all in there,
[9003.74s -> 9005.74s]  like, what's that thing?
[9005.74s -> 9012.01s]  Is this guy okay?
[9022.38s -> 9025.06s]  Let's make some pan. Ooh!
[9025.06s -> 9029.74s]  Ah, I love this.
[9029.74s -> 9033.13s]  It's so delicious.
[9033.13s -> 9035.94s]  A nice hot tortilla.
[9035.94s -> 9037.94s]  Whoa!
[9037.94s -> 9040.44s]  I want to eat this. I want
[9040.44s -> 9042.87s]  a nice, like, traditional
[9042.87s -> 9044.87s]  taco right now. You know what I mean?
[9044.87s -> 9048.33s]  With, like, that soft
[9048.33s -> 9050.33s]  like, that soft corn
[9050.33s -> 9053.40s]  tortilla.
[9053.40s -> 9055.40s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[9055.40s -> 9058.92s]  See you guys tomorrow.
[9058.92s -> 9060.92s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[9060.92s -> 9062.92s]  I'll be back, I'll see you guys in a little bit.
[9077.82s -> 9083.77s]  Don't you like when I do this?
[9083.77s -> 9092.07s]  Mince. Onion.
[9092.07s -> 9094.57s]  Let's get a little bit of
[9094.57s -> 9096.57s]  cilantro. Maybe some
[9096.57s -> 9098.57s]  carne asada. Oh!
[9098.57s -> 9100.57s]  And a corn tortilla.
[9100.57s -> 9102.57s]  A little bit of green chili sauce.
[9102.57s -> 9104.57s]  Oh my God!
[9104.57s -> 9130.94s]  I'm gonna see, I'm leaving.
[9130.94s -> 9145.40s]  The onions are browning?
[9145.40s -> 9148.98s]  Ah, it's alright.
[9148.98s -> 9152.76s]  Dude, why is it a hot dog?
[9152.76s -> 9154.76s]  I don't know what this is. My back of my
[9154.76s -> 9156.76s]  mouth right now. Right here.
[9156.76s -> 9158.76s]  Like, right here.
[9158.76s -> 9160.76s]  It's just, it's activating.
[9160.76s -> 9162.76s]  It's activating right now.
[9162.76s -> 9171.66s]  It's like that, Matt, you know
[9171.66s -> 9173.66s]  like that smell, that taco
[9173.66s -> 9175.66s]  meat smell? It's activating.
[9175.66s -> 9177.66s]  It's like in here, like back here.
[9177.66s -> 9182.01s]  What, are you a toot?
[9182.01s -> 9184.01s]  Am I a toot or
[9184.01s -> 9186.01s]  am I a teeth fucking hurt right now?
[9186.01s -> 9188.01s]  I gotta go to the dentist.
[9188.01s -> 9194.28s]  Is it a lizard? No.
[9194.28s -> 9196.28s]  I sound like glands. Yes, my glands
[9196.28s -> 9199.42s]  have been activated.
[9199.42s -> 9201.42s]  I just smelled that and it was like
[9201.42s -> 9203.42s]  into my nose, into the sinuses.
[9203.42s -> 9205.42s]  Activate glands. Glands are now producing
[9205.42s -> 9207.42s]  endorphins and serotonin
[9207.42s -> 9209.42s]  into my brain. My brain's saying
[9209.42s -> 9211.42s]  go get this right now. Put your
[9211.42s -> 9213.42s]  head over the pan to smell. Then that's
[9213.42s -> 9215.42s]  going all the way down to my stomach and my stomach goes
[9215.42s -> 9217.85s]  bleh. I can't wait.
[9217.85s -> 9219.85s]  I'm getting tacos tonight.
[9219.85s -> 9230.86s]  It's not a joke.
[9230.86s -> 9232.86s]  You have
[9232.86s -> 9235.80s]  salivary glands.
[9235.80s -> 9238.68s]  We can't talk science
[9238.68s -> 9240.68s]  in this chat room? Why not?
[9240.68s -> 9249.62s]  You're a dog.
[9249.62s -> 9253.02s]  I'm being real.
[9253.02s -> 9263.19s]  Why do I have such trouble with the lettuce?
[9263.19s -> 9266.01s]  I'm just trying to pull. Pull the
[9266.01s -> 9269.21s]  fucking thing.
[9269.21s -> 9271.83s]  I believe science.
[9271.83s -> 9273.83s]  I believe in the science of God.
[9273.83s -> 9276.58s]  Alright, I gotta make this.
[9276.58s -> 9278.58s]  I gotta make my taco.
[9278.58s -> 9280.58s]  Look at that JPEG.
[9280.58s -> 9284.87s]  Ugh.
[9284.87s -> 9293.38s]  Okay.
[9293.38s -> 9295.38s]  We're not at
[9295.38s -> 9297.38s]  Subway. Okay?
[9297.38s -> 9299.38s]  I don't know how many cheese triangles I would
[9299.38s -> 9303.61s]  put in. Okay. Where's the meat?
[9303.61s -> 9307.90s]  Where's the meat?
[9307.90s -> 9318.71s]  Where's the onions?
[9318.71s -> 9329.53s]  Why can't I just put it in?
[9329.53s -> 9331.53s]  That's a joke.
[9331.53s -> 9333.53s]  That's a
[9333.53s -> 9335.53s]  I have a friend that works at Subway.
[9335.53s -> 9338.22s]  And
[9338.22s -> 9340.22s]  I'll give you like six more triangles.
[9340.22s -> 9354.42s]  What am I even
[9354.42s -> 9357.18s]  looking at right here?
[9357.18s -> 9359.93s]  I can't even tell what that is.
[9359.93s -> 9362.49s]  Alright, what do we now do?
[9362.49s -> 9364.49s]  Alright, we gotta do this tofu dish.
[9364.49s -> 9366.73s]  No meat.
[9366.73s -> 9369.85s]  Oh my god.
[9369.85s -> 9380.33s]  It's a lot of
[9380.33s -> 9383.19s]  chopping.
[9383.19s -> 9385.19s]  How close am I to the Wii sensor bar?
[9385.19s -> 9387.19s]  Umm.
[9387.19s -> 9390.78s]  It is right here.
[9390.78s -> 9392.78s]  Right there.
[9392.78s -> 9394.78s]  Is that bad? Should I pull back a little?
[9394.78s -> 9408.98s]  Tofu.
[9408.98s -> 9411.67s]  The flavored soap
[9411.67s -> 9414.36s]  of the culinary world.
[9414.36s -> 9425.69s]  It has radiation.
[9425.69s -> 9433.94s]  Everything. What is all this?
[9433.94s -> 9435.94s]  Wasn't I doing tofu?
[9435.94s -> 9437.94s]  This is
[9437.94s -> 9440.31s]  tofu.
[9440.31s -> 9442.31s]  Wait, why
[9442.31s -> 9445.32s]  Wait, this is more
[9445.32s -> 9447.32s]  It's like three times more meat than tofu.
[9447.32s -> 9458.33s]  That's not a cube
[9458.33s -> 9460.57s]  meat. So what, we're doing tofu
[9460.57s -> 9462.57s]  and meat? What kind of meat was that?
[9462.57s -> 9467.30s]  It was minced
[9467.30s -> 9472.62s]  pork. Alright, take that up.
[9472.62s -> 9475.82s]  Alright, come on meat.
[9475.82s -> 9481.45s]  Come on, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup.
[9481.45s -> 9483.45s]  Alright, take it up.
[9483.45s -> 9487.48s]  Cutting the meat with the tofu.
[9487.48s -> 9493.50s]  Alright, now stew the
[9493.50s -> 9500.73s]  Mapo tofu.
[9500.73s -> 9502.73s]  In goes the spicy miso bean
[9502.73s -> 9513.16s]  sauce. More red chili
[9513.16s -> 9515.59s]  paste. Really crank it.
[9515.59s -> 9521.03s]  Soy sauce.
[9521.03s -> 9526.66s]  Let it simmer a little bit.
[9526.66s -> 9529.74s]  And we have white salt. Or is this garlic
[9529.74s -> 9531.74s]  powder? Onion powder? Potato starch.
[9531.74s -> 9538.39s]  I need it.
[9538.39s -> 9540.39s]  I need it.
[9540.39s -> 9543.98s]  What does tofu taste like?
[9543.98s -> 9545.98s]  Whatever you decided to put
[9545.98s -> 9548.98s]  on it. You can make it taste like pretty much
[9548.98s -> 9550.98s]  anything. That's why I said it's
[9550.98s -> 9552.98s]  the flavored soap of the culinary
[9552.98s -> 9561.82s]  world.
[9561.82s -> 9563.82s]  New recipe. Ooh, what are those dumplings?
[9563.82s -> 9565.82s]  I love
[9565.82s -> 9567.82s]  dumplings. I love
[9567.82s -> 9569.82s]  dumplings. I love
[9569.82s -> 9572.25s]  dumplings.
[9572.25s -> 9574.25s]  Oh, they're pork buns. Okay. Oh, but still.
[9574.25s -> 9577.38s]  Pork dumplings seriously are
[9577.38s -> 9583.27s]  like, there's this place in
[9583.27s -> 9585.27s]  Paris. I forget the name of the restaurant
[9585.27s -> 9587.27s]  but there's a place in Paris that does, they have
[9587.27s -> 9589.27s]  a park that moves by in Paris.
[9589.27s -> 9592.54s]  No, no, no.
[9592.54s -> 9594.54s]  Paris Casino in Vegas.
[9594.54s -> 9596.54s]  Not like I went to
[9596.54s -> 9598.54s]  Paris and had steamed pork
[9598.54s -> 9600.84s]  buns.
[9600.84s -> 9602.84s]  There's a place in Paris that does
[9602.84s -> 9604.84s]  really, really good
[9604.84s -> 9606.84s]  steamed dumplings.
[9606.84s -> 9611.77s]  Yeah, I got the best
[9611.77s -> 9613.77s]  dumplings ever in Paris, France.
[9613.77s -> 9621.19s]  Dude, I can't.
[9621.19s -> 9631.88s]  Rich streamer goes to France.
[9631.88s -> 9633.88s]  No, I went to Pretend France
[9633.88s -> 9639.19s]  in Las Vegas.
[9639.19s -> 9641.19s]  Paris Resort and Casino. They have a
[9641.19s -> 9643.19s]  dumpling place. It's pretty good.
[9643.19s -> 9645.19s]  At the dumplings. You have the pork dumplings, the spicy
[9645.19s -> 9647.19s]  pork dumplings. They're fucking phenomenal.
[9647.19s -> 9649.50s]  What's the name of this place?
[9649.50s -> 9651.50s]  I say Hash House or Gogo every day.
[9651.50s -> 9668.46s]  Like, I might as well say another one.
[9668.46s -> 9670.46s]  Rich streamer eats out regularly on
[9670.46s -> 9677.75s]  the Las Vegas strip.
[9677.75s -> 9679.75s]  I've been to this place twice in two years.
[9679.75s -> 9683.78s]  It's not expensive.
[9683.78s -> 9703.29s]  He's blowing all the bits on dumplings.
[9703.29s -> 9706.94s]  What if I was? What if I was blowing
[9706.94s -> 9708.94s]  all the bits on delicious dumplings?
[9708.94s -> 9713.16s]  What if I was?
[9713.16s -> 9717.83s]  Would you rather
[9717.83s -> 9719.83s]  use it on drugs?
[9719.83s -> 9723.54s]  Didn't think so.
[9723.54s -> 9731.80s]  Let's make, we're gonna mince this.
[9739.35s -> 9745.69s]  Do a drug test.
[9748.31s -> 9750.31s]  I know a lot of
[9750.31s -> 9752.31s]  people will be like, whoa
[9752.31s -> 9754.31s]  Pog, let's make him do a drug
[9754.31s -> 9756.31s]  test.
[9756.31s -> 9758.31s]  I mean, my
[9758.31s -> 9760.31s]  fucking sodium level might be a little high.
[9760.31s -> 9764.34s]  Nothing on there.
[9764.34s -> 9766.90s]  Gonna be a lot of X's.
[9766.90s -> 9774.14s]  My cholesterol might be like slightly
[9774.14s -> 9776.14s]  elevated. I don't know.
[9776.14s -> 9789.45s]  Slightly. I eat pretty healthy guys.
[9789.45s -> 9791.45s]  I don't eat like crap every day.
[9791.45s -> 9795.16s]  I just told you guys
[9795.16s -> 9797.16s]  about one of my favorite snacks.
[9797.16s -> 9799.16s]  It was peanut butter and celery. And everyone was like
[9799.16s -> 9801.16s]  UGH!
[9801.16s -> 9803.16s]  That's like a healthy thing to eat.
[9803.16s -> 9808.66s]  That's not healthy.
[9808.66s -> 9815.45s]  But wait, what year
[9815.45s -> 9817.45s]  is it where peanut butter is not
[9817.45s -> 9819.45s]  seen as a healthy food right now?
[9819.45s -> 9821.45s]  What planet
[9821.45s -> 9825.10s]  are we on? Peanut butter is
[9825.10s -> 9827.10s]  you could fucking literally live on peanut butter.
[9827.10s -> 9829.91s]  You could eat peanut butter
[9829.91s -> 9831.91s]  and live off of it. It's got everything.
[9831.91s -> 9835.75s]  Peanut butter is very
[9835.75s -> 9843.37s]  It's not a saturated
[9843.37s -> 9845.37s]  fat. You guys, fat is not
[9845.37s -> 9847.37s]  bad. There are good fats.
[9847.37s -> 9849.37s]  All fat is not bad.
[9849.37s -> 9866.14s]  Who told you this?
[9866.14s -> 9868.95s]  Who told you that fat was bad?
[9868.95s -> 9872.09s]  Yeah,
[9872.09s -> 9874.09s]  don't drink the fucking grease
[9874.09s -> 9876.09s]  out of the pan when you're done cooking your hamburger.
[9876.09s -> 9878.09s]  But all the unsaturated
[9878.09s -> 9880.09s]  monounsaturated fats are
[9880.09s -> 9882.09s]  are good.
[9882.09s -> 9884.26s]  What doctor are you going to?
[9884.26s -> 9896.10s]  Everybody knows this.
[9896.10s -> 9898.98s]  I'm going to fuck
[9898.98s -> 9907.43s]  people fucking with you.
[9907.43s -> 9917.22s]  So many hydrogenated oils. Get the real stuff.
[9917.22s -> 9919.22s]  Imagine being a doctor.
[9919.22s -> 9921.22s]  I'm not a fucking doctor.
[9921.22s -> 9923.22s]  Real peanut butter is good for you.
[9923.22s -> 9925.22s]  What?
[9925.22s -> 9927.22s]  This is not like wow.
[9927.22s -> 9930.81s]  Hold on, I'm going to steam these.
[9930.81s -> 9935.53s]  Turn it off!
[9935.53s -> 9937.53s]  Magic cooking was just fucking hard.
[9937.53s -> 9939.53s]  All right, you put it in there for one second
[9939.53s -> 9941.53s]  and turn it off at the exact moment or you're going to burn it.
[9941.53s -> 9947.93s]  Idiot doctor.
[9947.93s -> 9949.93s]  Mmm, those look good.
[9949.93s -> 9962.07s]  So you want to see how
[9962.07s -> 9964.07s]  you want to see just how
[9964.07s -> 9966.07s]  ridiculous Earth is right now.
[9966.07s -> 9968.07s]  I hurt my hand, accidentally hit it
[9968.07s -> 9970.07s]  on my desk. You didn't see it. I just typed
[9970.07s -> 9972.07s]  in peanut butter of radiation.
[9972.07s -> 9981.40s]  Let me just shut it off here.
[9981.40s -> 9983.40s]  Are peanuts radioactive and do they cause
[9983.40s -> 10021.16s]  cancer? I had an x-ray
[10021.16s -> 10023.16s]  recently.
[10023.16s -> 10026.55s]  All right.
[10026.55s -> 10028.55s]  I ate like 50,000 bananas.
[10028.55s -> 10030.55s]  For like 200 million bananas.
[10030.55s -> 10032.86s]  I'll never eat
[10032.86s -> 10040.92s]  that many bananas in my life.
[10040.92s -> 10042.92s]  This is huge.
[10042.92s -> 10044.92s]  Wait, is this tofu? Is this a bath towel?
[10044.92s -> 10056.38s]  What's my favorite fruit? Kiwis.
[10056.38s -> 10058.38s]  Whoa, I put it on the wiki.
[10058.38s -> 10060.38s]  I didn't know that.
[10060.38s -> 10065.82s]  Wait, I gotta pay for this.
[10065.82s -> 10067.82s]  That's actually kiwis. Kiwis are fucking unbelievable.
[10067.82s -> 10069.82s]  You can't eat a kiwi
[10069.82s -> 10071.82s]  and not like it. It's so sweet.
[10071.82s -> 10073.82s]  When you bite down
[10073.82s -> 10075.82s]  on the seeds, they're a little bit
[10075.82s -> 10077.82s]  chewy. You get that little snap
[10077.82s -> 10079.82s]  on the seeds. Nothing is better
[10079.82s -> 10085.83s]  than that. Yeah, if you know, you
[10085.83s -> 10088.58s]  know. How many do you eat?
[10088.58s -> 10095.05s]  No, I don't eat the skin.
[10095.05s -> 10097.05s]  I don't eat the skin. It's like fuzzy and weird.
[10097.05s -> 10106.26s]  Watermelon? Do we...
[10106.26s -> 10108.26s]  Watermelons are pretty good.
[10108.26s -> 10110.26s]  Watermelon is almost like a dessert
[10110.26s -> 10112.26s]  fruit, though, because it's just
[10112.26s -> 10114.26s]  water. There's nothing really
[10114.26s -> 10116.26s]  in it. It's just water.
[10116.26s -> 10118.26s]  It's the first word of the fruit.
[10118.26s -> 10120.63s]  I love it. I like watermelon,
[10120.63s -> 10122.63s]  but you're essentially
[10122.63s -> 10124.63s]  breathing air when you eat a watermelon.
[10124.63s -> 10143.64s]  Xiaomian? Oh, I love
[10143.64s -> 10146.71s]  Xiaomian. BRB? I'm gonna
[10146.71s -> 10148.71s]  stick my head in a watermelon. Why?
[10148.71s -> 10151.85s]  Pineapple sucks.
[10151.85s -> 10153.85s]  Pineapple's my second favorite fruit.
[10153.85s -> 10155.85s]  Pineapple has bromelain
[10155.85s -> 10157.85s]  in it. Like, oh my god,
[10157.85s -> 10159.85s]  holy shit, I can't believe this guy knows what that is.
[10159.85s -> 10161.85s]  I thought he was just an idiot.
[10161.85s -> 10163.85s]  I didn't know how to knead dough in Cooking Mama.
[10163.85s -> 10165.85s]  Let's get bromelain in it. It's good for you.
[10165.85s -> 10171.91s]  I don't eat too much pineapple, though,
[10171.91s -> 10173.91s]  because the same thing that's good for you
[10173.91s -> 10175.91s]  actually is like a flesh-eating enzyme.
[10175.91s -> 10179.37s]  I don't eat too much, just enough.
[10179.37s -> 10184.49s]  Ooh. Oh!
[10184.49s -> 10190.55s]  Do it! Dude,
[10190.55s -> 10194.39s]  this is sick!
[10194.39s -> 10204.44s]  Why is it all going onto the floor?
[10204.44s -> 10206.44s]  Granny Smith apples to guard here. Green
[10206.44s -> 10208.44s]  apples. Green apples are better than red
[10208.44s -> 10212.41s]  apples. Pax! Just hit
[10212.41s -> 10216.38s]  right here. Yep. Xiaomian?
[10216.38s -> 10224.57s]  Macintosh apples are better
[10224.57s -> 10226.57s]  than both of them combined.
[10226.57s -> 10228.57s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[10228.57s -> 10230.57s]  I'll throw the axe.
[10230.57s -> 10232.57s]  Like, that was wrong.
[10232.57s -> 10235.00s]  Macintosh apples are better than
[10235.00s -> 10237.00s]  Granny Smith apples, but
[10237.00s -> 10239.00s]  green apples are
[10239.00s -> 10241.00s]  better than Macintosh apples.
[10241.00s -> 10243.00s]  Okay, that's better.
[10243.00s -> 10246.01s]  I love the little soft
[10246.01s -> 10248.01s]  Macintosh apples. You can just eat them.
[10248.01s -> 10250.01s]  They're so...
[10250.01s -> 10252.01s]  The flesh is so mushy and so
[10252.01s -> 10254.01s]  easy to bite through. I don't like eating
[10254.01s -> 10256.01s]  apples because I have to cut them up and
[10256.01s -> 10258.01s]  carve them up and shit.
[10258.01s -> 10260.01s]  I want to eat it with my hand. And a lot of times
[10260.01s -> 10262.01s]  when I eat an apple, it's like...
[10262.01s -> 10264.25s]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
[10264.25s -> 10266.25s]  This hurts. This hurts.
[10266.25s -> 10268.25s]  And I use my
[10268.25s -> 10270.25s]  bottom fucking teeth to go in harder.
[10270.25s -> 10272.25s]  It hurts. I don't want to do that.
[10272.25s -> 10279.61s]  Curry. Ooh, nice.
[10279.61s -> 10283.38s]  I see a dentist. My teeth are in fucking
[10283.38s -> 10286.26s]  perfect condition.
[10286.26s -> 10288.26s]  You want my teeth? You want my x-rays from my dentist?
[10288.26s -> 10304.71s]  It's like releasing your
[10304.71s -> 10306.71s]  tax returns. Let's see the x-rays of your
[10306.71s -> 10309.08s]  teeth. Let's see your teeth
[10309.08s -> 10311.08s]  returns.
[10315.82s -> 10317.82s]  Alright, let's grate that cheese.
[10317.82s -> 10321.90s]  Ginger or
[10321.90s -> 10323.90s]  ginseng or whatever it is.
[10325.90s -> 10332.49s]  If Kim was in the room right now,
[10332.49s -> 10334.49s]  she would be doing the thing
[10334.49s -> 10336.49s]  I was doing when I was making
[10336.49s -> 10338.49s]  the tacos onto the spring.
[10338.49s -> 10340.49s]  She'd be going, oh my god,
[10340.49s -> 10342.49s]  yes! Oh, look at that!
[10342.49s -> 10344.49s]  Kim loves curry.
[10357.24s -> 10361.51s]  Does she like curry?
[10361.51s -> 10363.51s]  Yeah, I guess.
[10366.52s -> 10368.76s]  Alright, let's put it together.
[10368.76s -> 10373.18s]  Fruit tier list? I already did it.
[10373.18s -> 10377.66s]  I did a fruit tier list.
[10379.66s -> 10382.92s]  Human.
[10382.92s -> 10389.37s]  Remake it?
[10389.37s -> 10402.30s]  I'm not going to remake
[10402.30s -> 10405.05s]  the list. Oh shit, I can do this!
[10405.05s -> 10409.27s]  I'll put the cinnamon in it.
[10409.27s -> 10422.31s]  I didn't know I could do that. Get it in the stew.
[10422.31s -> 10430.04s]  Are you depressed?
[10430.04s -> 10433.24s]  No, I just, okay.
[10433.24s -> 10435.24s]  I have deep set eyes.
[10435.24s -> 10437.54s]  Okay, sorry.
[10437.54s -> 10439.54s]  Dude, are you angry? Is something
[10439.54s -> 10441.54s]  wrong? Why do you look like you're going
[10441.54s -> 10443.54s]  to swing at me? I have deep
[10443.54s -> 10446.36s]  set eyes. I can't, what?
[10446.36s -> 10456.60s]  That's what it is.
[10456.60s -> 10458.60s]  There's a shadow cast over my eyes forever.
[10458.60s -> 10461.74s]  And it just makes me
[10461.74s -> 10463.74s]  look villainous because there's a shadow here
[10463.74s -> 10465.98s]  because of the lighting. If you see me out
[10465.98s -> 10467.98s]  in person, I look happy.
[10467.98s -> 10471.11s]  I have deep set eyes.
[10471.11s -> 10480.70s]  Why do you stream in the dark?
[10480.70s -> 10485.11s]  Do we have to talk about this
[10485.11s -> 10487.11s]  every stream?
[10487.11s -> 10489.11s]  I start the stream during the day
[10489.11s -> 10491.42s]  and during the night time,
[10491.42s -> 10493.42s]  if I have my webcams
[10493.42s -> 10495.42s]  gain up, I'll get blown out.
[10495.42s -> 10503.16s]  Why do we have to keep
[10503.16s -> 10505.16s]  explaining this? And I don't use auto.
[10505.16s -> 10513.86s]  This looks much better?
[10513.86s -> 10523.91s]  I disagree. Nice chest tier.
[10523.91s -> 10525.91s]  I was going to give the finger to the camera,
[10525.91s -> 10527.91s]  but I decided not to.
[10527.91s -> 10529.91s]  Because it would be used against me.
[10529.91s -> 10538.41s]  Alright, I fuck
[10538.41s -> 10540.78s]  this up every time.
[10540.78s -> 10542.78s]  Slowly pour it, right?
[10542.78s -> 10544.78s]  Slowly pour it out, right?
[10544.78s -> 10547.34s]  Okay, slowly pour it.
[10547.34s -> 10562.74s]  We have to
[10562.74s -> 10564.98s]  bake it? Steam the rice.
[10564.98s -> 10586.41s]  Let's go.
[10586.41s -> 10588.41s]  What do I think of Cadbury Eggs?
[10588.41s -> 10592.30s]  I'll tell you.
[10614.14s -> 10621.12s]  You've never seen the commercial?
[10621.12s -> 10624.64s]  Oh, right. Because
[10624.64s -> 10627.01s]  you have not seen that.
[10627.01s -> 10629.01s]  Right. Cadbury Eggs had a commercial
[10629.01s -> 10631.01s]  with a bunny rabbit that did a chicken sound
[10631.01s -> 10633.01s]  like that. Exactly like that?
[10633.01s -> 10638.05s]  Um, okay.
[10638.05s -> 10640.05s]  I forget that I'm probably 20 years older than half
[10640.05s -> 10642.05s]  the people in this chat room.
[10642.05s -> 10644.74s]  Sometimes I forget.
[10654.23s -> 10656.23s]  I'm 25. I never saw that.
[10656.23s -> 10658.73s]  I'm still 10 years older than you.
[10658.73s -> 10661.42s]  I'm a decade older than you. Think about that.
[10661.42s -> 10663.91s]  I'm 10 years older than you.
[10663.91s -> 10665.91s]  Look at the wisdom
[10665.91s -> 10672.06s]  that I have that you don't.
[10672.06s -> 10675.90s]  Wait, didn't I just make this?
[10675.90s -> 10682.81s]  Am I making this?
[10682.81s -> 10685.56s]  Am I remaking this?
[10685.56s -> 10687.56s]  I'm doing it. I'm doing it again.
[10687.56s -> 10690.12s]  This is a different one. Okay.
[10703.22s -> 10705.22s]  Okay, the lamb curry.
[10705.22s -> 10712.38s]  Let's cut it up into pieces.
[10712.38s -> 10714.38s]  I love that sound. That like
[10714.38s -> 10720.72s]  shwoop, shwoop.
[10720.72s -> 10722.72s]  What happened to Chibi-Robo?
[10724.72s -> 10726.72s]  I got pushed to tomorrow.
[10726.72s -> 10731.07s]  The disc was broken.
[10731.07s -> 10733.07s]  I had to return it.
[10733.07s -> 10735.07s]  Like, I got a fucking broken disc.
[10735.07s -> 10737.07s]  I don't know what happened inside the way it broke.
[10741.38s -> 10743.38s]  Actually, I'll be honest with you.
[10743.38s -> 10745.38s]  I've got to make sure I prepare that.
[10745.38s -> 10748.32s]  I've got to get that ready to go.
[10748.32s -> 10750.32s]  There cannot be any fucking
[10750.32s -> 10752.32s]  mistakes there.
[10752.32s -> 10754.32s]  I will make sure that that's what we're doing
[10754.32s -> 10759.31s]  tomorrow. No matter what.
[10759.31s -> 10761.31s]  The SD card is a couple of options.
[10761.31s -> 10763.31s]  I just didn't want to do it like in the middle of the stream.
[10763.31s -> 10765.31s]  Like, I would have fucked something up and it would have been bad.
[10765.31s -> 10782.14s]  Give me another one. Another bullseye.
[10782.14s -> 10788.93s]  Rage, quit Chibi-Robo.
[10788.93s -> 10790.93s]  Cook, not gonna lie. You'll be
[10790.93s -> 10793.94s]  vibing. So I'm just gonna give 20
[10793.94s -> 10797.07s]  subs. Knock, turn.
[10797.07s -> 10799.57s]  Knock, turn.
[10799.57s -> 10801.57s]  Thanks for the 20 community subs.
[10801.57s -> 10803.57s]  Knock, turn.
[10803.57s -> 10806.83s]  Tak-ta-turn.
[10806.83s -> 10810.29s]  Knock, turn. Act-ta-turn.
[10810.29s -> 10812.53s]  Thank you. That's a fucking...
[10812.53s -> 10816.30s]  No problem.
[10816.30s -> 10818.67s]  That's a lot of subs. Thank you.
[10818.67s -> 10820.67s]  Congratulations to those that got the community
[10820.67s -> 10823.17s]  subs. Knock, turn.
[10823.17s -> 10828.54s]  Tax return?
[10828.54s -> 10831.55s]  What a god. People drop huge
[10831.55s -> 10833.55s]  sub-gifts in here.
[10833.55s -> 10835.55s]  This is kind of crazy.
[10835.55s -> 10839.90s]  Laurel? What is Laurel?
[10839.90s -> 10852.37s]  What is Laurel?
[10852.37s -> 10854.67s]  Yanny? What is a Yanny?
[10854.67s -> 10857.62s]  What are you guys all saying?
[10857.62s -> 10860.88s]  What are you guys doing? What is this?
[10860.88s -> 10867.92s]  What is a Yanny?
[10867.92s -> 10869.92s]  He's pretending. I don't know what
[10869.92s -> 10871.92s]  that is. I don't know what
[10871.92s -> 10873.92s]  Yanny is.
[10873.92s -> 10880.32s]  It's a joke.
[10880.32s -> 10882.32s]  It's how I'm pretending.
[10882.32s -> 10884.94s]  I don't know what...
[10884.94s -> 10886.94s]  I'm not pretending. I don't know what that is.
[10886.94s -> 10889.25s]  Do you
[10889.25s -> 10893.28s]  live under a rock?
[10893.28s -> 10895.28s]  I live technically under wood.
[10895.28s -> 10906.14s]  Hot ass.
[10906.14s -> 10909.66s]  I don't know what that is.
[10909.66s -> 10915.62s]  Oh, he's a wise guy.
[10915.62s -> 10920.66s]  He knows it sucks.
[10920.66s -> 10926.67s]  I...
[10926.67s -> 10928.67s]  Yeah, it sucks. Whatever.
[10928.67s -> 10930.67s]  I remember watching it when I was younger.
[10930.67s -> 10932.67s]  How am I going to make
[10932.67s -> 10934.67s]  this little doll up into something huge?
[10950.40s -> 10954.75s]  This is my favorite
[10954.75s -> 10956.75s]  game. I did not know he was playing it.
[10956.75s -> 10958.75s]  How did I not know I was... Well, because we had to pivot.
[10958.75s -> 10960.75s]  We had to do a hard pivot
[10960.75s -> 10962.75s]  in this game. This is not something
[10962.75s -> 10965.25s]  I planned on doing today.
[10965.25s -> 10967.25s]  But you're probably really happy to see that it's here.
[10967.25s -> 10973.01s]  Cilantro,
[10973.01s -> 10975.01s]  carne asada, green chili sauce.
[10975.01s -> 10977.01s]  Oh, yep.
[10977.01s -> 10979.01s]  We're good.
[10986.50s -> 10988.50s]  Cilantro tastes like soap.
[10988.50s -> 10990.50s]  If you use
[10990.50s -> 10992.50s]  too much of it, I agree with you. I don't like a lot
[10992.50s -> 10994.50s]  of cilantro. I like just enough to get a little bit
[10994.50s -> 10998.98s]  of that flavor.
[10998.98s -> 11000.98s]  Too much
[11000.98s -> 11002.98s]  cilantro just doesn't taste
[11002.98s -> 11012.19s]  great. My father hates
[11012.19s -> 11014.75s]  cilantro. If my father's even in
[11014.75s -> 11016.75s]  the same room as cilantro, he will
[11016.75s -> 11025.39s]  throw up. Did I do them all?
[11028.21s -> 11032.18s]  What's left?
[11032.18s -> 11034.18s]  Holy shit, there's a whole page I didn't do. The cream puffs!
[11034.18s -> 11036.18s]  What am I thinking? I didn't do the cream puff.
[11036.18s -> 11049.68s]  Cream puffs with ice cream
[11049.68s -> 11052.18s]  are better than cream puffs with the cream.
[11057.92s -> 11059.92s]  Is that, um, accurate for a lot of you guys?
[11059.92s -> 11064.38s]  That's wrong?
[11064.38s -> 11071.10s]  That's okay. Is it soggy?
[11071.10s -> 11073.10s]  Well, you have to eat it right away. You gotta eat it right away.
[11073.10s -> 11081.74s]  Stew?
[11081.74s -> 11084.75s]  Oh, we're making sugar?
[11084.75s -> 11087.57s]  Oh my god, vomit
[11087.57s -> 11097.04s]  father. I thought we were over
[11097.04s -> 11101.20s]  that. Vomit father.
[11101.20s -> 11108.86s]  That's a lot of butter. I don't
[11108.86s -> 11112.90s]  even know what to say.
[11112.90s -> 11117.63s]  It makes me cry! Just eat
[11117.63s -> 11119.63s]  butter. Vomit father.
[11119.63s -> 11121.63s]  Why is there an egg going in
[11121.63s -> 11126.05s]  here?
[11126.05s -> 11133.66s]  What is this?
[11133.66s -> 11138.53s]  Local streamers afraid of butter?
[11138.53s -> 11141.28s]  It's custard, dummy.
[11141.28s -> 11143.28s]  Well, get away from me, because I go violent!
[11143.28s -> 11148.27s]  Oh, I can't, okay.
[11148.27s -> 11150.27s]  I finished, I fucking, I can't.
[11150.27s -> 11152.27s]  I have ADHD.
[11152.27s -> 11154.27s]  Let's use that as an excuse for literally everything
[11154.27s -> 11156.83s]  I've ever done in my whole, my entire life.
[11156.83s -> 11168.40s]  Okay, good.
[11168.40s -> 11170.40s]  Now do it like this.
[11175.46s -> 11178.08s]  Jeremy!
[11178.08s -> 11180.58s]  Blah blah!
[11180.58s -> 11192.08s]  He's snapping all the time.
[11194.38s -> 11196.38s]  I don't give a shit.
[11196.38s -> 11208.10s]  Alright.
[11208.10s -> 11210.53s]  Turn off!
[11210.53s -> 11212.70s]  Do it that quick.
[11212.70s -> 11214.70s]  Oh, he will. He will.
[11214.70s -> 11220.21s]  Anything can be...
[11220.21s -> 11222.21s]  We've seen like five to ten different deepfakes
[11222.21s -> 11224.21s]  at this point. Do you think I really care?
[11224.21s -> 11226.21s]  Do you think I'm at the point right now
[11226.21s -> 11228.21s]  where I'm like, man, I really hope they don't like
[11228.21s -> 11230.21s]  put me in something that I'm not
[11230.21s -> 11232.21s]  in? Not right now!
[11232.21s -> 11240.14s]  What's Jello made of?
[11240.14s -> 11244.94s]  I don't know.
[11244.94s -> 11249.23s]  Bones.
[11249.23s -> 11268.75s]  Jelly, on the other hand. Why would you
[11268.75s -> 11271.82s]  do it like this?
[11271.82s -> 11277.14s]  What the fuck?
[11277.14s -> 11279.14s]  Only one egg? I can't try again?
[11279.14s -> 11292.90s]  It's wasting.
[11292.90s -> 11294.90s]  It was implied that she's just doing it for me.
[11294.90s -> 11299.06s]  What's the difference between jam and jelly?
[11299.06s -> 11301.06s]  Tons of differences.
[11301.06s -> 11303.06s]  A fucking huge amount of differences.
[11303.06s -> 11305.06s]  But we're not going to get into them today.
[11305.06s -> 11331.36s]  Jelly is based...
[11331.36s -> 11333.36s]  It's just based Jello.
[11333.36s -> 11347.76s]  What are you talking about?
[11347.76s -> 11354.46s]  Vanilla extract.
[11354.46s -> 11356.77s]  Can't that stuff kill you?
[11356.77s -> 11359.46s]  If you have too much vanilla extract,
[11359.46s -> 11368.35s]  can it kill you?
[11368.35s -> 11372.13s]  Anything can kill you. Yeah.
[11372.13s -> 11374.13s]  Probably. If you chug it...
[11374.13s -> 11376.13s]  No, it's like straight alcohol, right?
[11376.13s -> 11378.13s]  It's very bad.
[11378.13s -> 11380.13s]  Hold the B button to squeeze the cream
[11380.13s -> 11382.13s]  onto the pastry. Be careful!
[11382.13s -> 11384.62s]  Alright, let's do it.
[11384.62s -> 11394.98s]  I don't know what you're talking about,
[11394.98s -> 11396.98s]  Mama.
[11396.98s -> 11398.98s]  This is how me and my family
[11398.98s -> 11415.23s]  like it.
[11415.23s -> 11417.66s]  That one in the top row, I would grab it immediately.
[11417.66s -> 11421.50s]  Too much cream?
[11421.50s -> 11424.38s]  I don't think this is actually a sentence
[11424.38s -> 11426.38s]  that makes sense when you say that.
[11426.38s -> 11431.38s]  Too much cream in your cream-filled
[11431.38s -> 11433.38s]  pastry. I don't know about that.
[11433.38s -> 11444.29s]  Ooh! What's that one?
[11444.29s -> 11446.29s]  Ooh, lasagna. My least favorite
[11446.29s -> 11448.29s]  Italian delight.
[11448.29s -> 11450.85s]  Dessert. Whatever.
[11450.85s -> 11452.85s]  My least favorite Italian
[11452.85s -> 11454.85s]  fantastic food.
[11454.85s -> 11465.20s]  Lasagna.
[11465.20s -> 11467.20s]  Actually, I don't like it.
[11467.20s -> 11469.44s]  Those of you that might be new
[11469.44s -> 11472.26s]  viewers,
[11472.26s -> 11474.26s]  I'll eat lasagna, but I don't really...
[11474.26s -> 11476.26s]  I would choose not to eat lasagna.
[11476.26s -> 11483.68s]  To me, it's kind of...
[11483.68s -> 11485.98s]  I don't know. It's kind of boring.
[11485.98s -> 11488.54s]  It kind of bores me.
[11490.54s -> 11492.54s]  Do you like spaghetti and meatballs?
[11492.54s -> 11495.81s]  Yeah, I do, but
[11495.81s -> 11497.81s]  lasagna is...
[11497.81s -> 11499.81s]  It's always like
[11499.81s -> 11501.81s]  mushes together.
[11501.81s -> 11503.81s]  It's usually like a meat sauce
[11503.81s -> 11505.81s]  and just layers of this
[11505.81s -> 11507.81s]  pasta sheets, and you take your fork
[11507.81s -> 11509.81s]  and just mush through it.
[11509.81s -> 11511.81s]  I don't know. I'm not...
[11511.81s -> 11513.81s]  I'll eat it. I don't hate it.
[11513.81s -> 11515.81s]  But I wouldn't order it.
[11515.81s -> 11518.18s]  It just doesn't do it for me.
[11518.18s -> 11521.25s]  It's like a spaghetti cake.
[11521.25s -> 11523.25s]  That's a good way to put it.
[11523.25s -> 11528.56s]  Do you like balsamic vinegar?
[11528.56s -> 11530.56s]  No.
[11530.56s -> 11532.56s]  I don't.
[11532.56s -> 11534.56s]  I actually don't.
[11534.56s -> 11539.30s]  I love olive oil, though.
[11539.30s -> 11541.30s]  It's like one of my favorite things on Earth.
[11545.71s -> 11550.70s]  That I can't stand by.
[11550.70s -> 11561.33s]  Why not?
[11561.33s -> 11563.33s]  A really good EVOO just dumped on top
[11563.33s -> 11567.17s]  of hummus. I could eat that every day
[11567.17s -> 11569.17s]  and be happy. You could just put me into a room
[11569.17s -> 11571.17s]  and have a fridge
[11571.17s -> 11573.17s]  in there, and in that fridge was just a ton of
[11573.17s -> 11575.17s]  just garlic hummuses,
[11575.17s -> 11577.17s]  some pita bread to the right, just like
[11577.17s -> 11579.17s]  hundreds of bags of it, and then
[11579.17s -> 11581.17s]  like 30 bottles of EVOO.
[11581.17s -> 11584.05s]  And you'd think like you were
[11584.05s -> 11586.05s]  torturing me, and I would be like, no, this is perfect.
[11586.05s -> 11588.05s]  Thanks. See you in a
[11588.05s -> 11590.05s]  fucking couple months when I want more of this.
[11604.13s -> 11609.18s]  Mr. Virgin olive oil.
[11609.18s -> 11613.28s]  Yeah, what's wrong with that?
[11613.28s -> 11615.28s]  Do I have an irritation under here or something? What's going on?
[11615.28s -> 11617.28s]  I'm a little irritated under here.
[11617.28s -> 11626.88s]  Why?
[11626.88s -> 11628.88s]  A mold rash.
[11628.88s -> 11643.22s]  EVOO.
[11643.22s -> 11645.22s]  Extra virgin olive oil.
[11645.22s -> 11647.78s]  Oh, I can taste it already.
[11647.78s -> 11651.42s]  So many foods.
[11651.42s -> 11653.42s]  I love food.
[11653.42s -> 11655.79s]  I'm a really
[11655.79s -> 11657.79s]  food motivated person.
[11657.79s -> 11670.34s]  You're a dog.
[11670.34s -> 11679.68s]  Says the man that doesn't eat lasagna.
[11679.68s -> 11681.68s]  Yeah, I have my different preferences,
[11681.68s -> 11683.68s]  but I love food.
[11686.37s -> 11689.30s]  You don't look like it.
[11689.30s -> 11693.97s]  I
[11693.97s -> 11695.97s]  really love food.
[11695.97s -> 11697.97s]  I never said I like to eat
[11697.97s -> 11699.97s]  too much of it every day.
[11699.97s -> 11702.46s]  When did I say I love food?
[11702.46s -> 11704.46s]  And I love eating way more than I'm
[11704.46s -> 11706.46s]  supposed to. Every day.
[11706.46s -> 11708.46s]  Well, I didn't say that.
[11708.46s -> 11712.37s]  Get that butter in there.
[11712.37s -> 11714.37s]  Hold on, guys.
[11714.37s -> 11724.86s]  Not ideal.
[11724.86s -> 11728.30s]  They're struck a nerve
[11728.30s -> 11731.50s]  there.
[11731.50s -> 11733.50s]  McDonald's?
[11733.50s -> 11737.54s]  I like McDonald's.
[11737.54s -> 11739.71s]  Onions.
[11739.71s -> 11750.51s]  All right.
[11750.51s -> 11758.00s]  Perfect timing.
[11758.00s -> 11762.61s]  Onions.
[11762.61s -> 11770.21s]  McDonald's is good.
[11770.21s -> 11772.21s]  If you say that McDonald's sucks,
[11772.21s -> 11774.21s]  you're probably smart.
[11774.21s -> 11776.21s]  You probably have a lot of intelligence
[11776.21s -> 11778.21s]  and your brain is huge.
[11778.21s -> 11783.33s]  I mean, come on.
[11783.33s -> 11785.33s]  For the rest of us, dumb fucking idiots.
[11785.33s -> 11787.33s]  You only eat McDonald's if you're
[11787.33s -> 11789.33s]  a fucking moron. For all of us other idiots.
[11789.33s -> 11791.33s]  I think it's
[11791.33s -> 11793.33s]  good. I like it.
[11793.33s -> 11802.67s]  I don't eat it all the time.
[11802.67s -> 11805.49s]  Here we go.
[11805.49s -> 11807.49s]  Idiot crew.
[11807.49s -> 11815.23s]  The idiot move is not going to Wendy's.
[11815.23s -> 11817.23s]  They're all good.
[11817.23s -> 11819.23s]  You just feel like them sometimes.
[11819.23s -> 11821.23s]  You go on a stint where you want one
[11821.23s -> 11823.23s]  of a month's rate.
[11823.23s -> 11825.23s]  And you don't want the other one.
[11825.23s -> 11832.02s]  Tomatoes, though.
[11832.02s -> 11837.07s]  Wendy's is dog shit.
[11837.07s -> 11839.07s]  No, I
[11839.07s -> 11841.07s]  ate it too much. So I'm just sick of
[11841.07s -> 11843.07s]  eating it. All right. Time to make
[11843.07s -> 11845.07s]  some lasagna. Memorize the example.
[11845.07s -> 11847.76s]  First,
[11847.76s -> 11849.76s]  a point of degree. First, a point to add the ingredients in the same
[11849.76s -> 11855.14s]  order. Make it in the same
[11855.14s -> 11858.08s]  order. All right.
[11858.08s -> 11860.38s]  Mushrooms, meat,
[11860.38s -> 11868.05s]  sheet.
[11868.05s -> 11870.05s]  Meat, sheet, mushrooms.
[11870.05s -> 11877.34s]  What is all that on top?
[11877.34s -> 11881.38s]  All right.
[11881.38s -> 11883.38s]  Meat, mushroom, sheet,
[11883.38s -> 11887.79s]  sheet.
[11887.79s -> 11889.79s]  That lasagna is terrible.
[11889.79s -> 11893.12s]  That's a true mess up.
[11893.12s -> 11895.12s]  Sheet, meat, mushroom,
[11895.12s -> 11897.55s]  sheet, sheet.
[11897.55s -> 11899.55s]  Sheet, meat, mushroom, sheet,
[11899.55s -> 11901.55s]  meat, mushroom, sheet, sheet.
[11901.55s -> 11909.02s]  Holy shit.
[11909.02s -> 11913.12s]  All right.
[11913.12s -> 11915.94s]  Put it in the oven.
[11915.94s -> 11917.94s]  We're going to cook this slow.
[11917.94s -> 11920.18s]  Slow.
[11920.18s -> 11927.15s]  Five degrees.
[11927.15s -> 11931.06s]  Looks like banana bread.
[11931.06s -> 11943.97s]  A lot of very good. Got something new.
[11943.97s -> 11946.40s]  This is a new dish.
[11946.40s -> 11948.70s]  Ooh.
[11948.70s -> 11952.59s]  Pumpkin.
[11952.59s -> 11955.54s]  Grilled bonito.
[11955.54s -> 11958.67s]  Hand fried lobster.
[11958.67s -> 11961.17s]  Let's do the bonito.
[11965.95s -> 11967.95s]  Gotta dice up the fish. What kind of fish is it?
[11967.95s -> 11969.95s]  It's a bonito.
[11969.95s -> 11992.27s]  Filet-o.
[11992.27s -> 11994.27s]  Head. Oh, sad face. His head.
[11997.65s -> 11999.65s]  He's slaughtering a fish.
[11999.65s -> 12014.50s]  Why are there four different salts?
[12014.50s -> 12016.74s]  I don't know.
[12016.74s -> 12018.74s]  It's like
[12018.74s -> 12020.74s]  sea salt and Himalayan
[12020.74s -> 12022.74s]  pink salt.
[12022.74s -> 12026.00s]  Deep salt. I don't know.
[12026.00s -> 12028.00s]  There's a lot of different salts.
[12028.00s -> 12031.97s]  Grill.
[12031.97s -> 12033.97s]  We didn't have the grill yet.
[12033.97s -> 12035.97s]  Hold the fan with the B button and wave it to increase
[12035.97s -> 12058.75s]  the heat.
[12058.75s -> 12060.75s]  How do I flip it?
[12060.75s -> 12062.75s]  Turn it over.
[12062.75s -> 12075.87s]  That looks pretty good.
[12075.87s -> 12077.87s]  Fish to me.
[12077.87s -> 12079.87s]  I love video game fish.
[12079.87s -> 12082.75s]  Hey.
[12082.75s -> 12091.58s]  You didn't tell me to take it off.
[12091.58s -> 12093.58s]  Video game fish looks so appetizing.
[12093.58s -> 12095.58s]  I like fish too in real life.
[12095.58s -> 12097.58s]  It's something about in a video game.
[12097.58s -> 12099.58s]  Just a fish on like a stick.
[12099.58s -> 12101.58s]  You know what I'm saying?
[12101.58s -> 12111.44s]  SpongeBob?
[12111.44s -> 12118.80s]  How many of these do I have?
[12123.65s -> 12147.20s]  Ah, that was raw.
[12147.20s -> 12149.20s]  It's the newest fish from SpongeBob.
[12149.20s -> 12153.68s]  All right.
[12153.68s -> 12155.68s]  Move the Weemo.
[12155.68s -> 12158.50s]  We're going to cut it up.
[12158.50s -> 12167.39s]  It's cooked, right?
[12167.39s -> 12172.96s]  It would.
[12172.96s -> 12174.96s]  I feel like it was tough to cut through that.
[12174.96s -> 12176.96s]  Shouldn't it have been moist and tender?
[12176.96s -> 12184.18s]  There's some grating.
[12184.18s -> 12186.18s]  Orito's the hardest food in the world.
[12186.18s -> 12191.30s]  The hardest to make
[12191.30s -> 12193.30s]  or it's physically hard
[12193.30s -> 12195.30s]  to chew through.
[12195.30s -> 12202.72s]  It's hard.
[12202.72s -> 12214.61s]  Physically hard.
[12214.61s -> 12216.61s]  You could kill someone with it.
[12216.61s -> 12218.61s]  Really? So that's accurate.
[12218.61s -> 12220.61s]  So it's like a big block.
[12220.61s -> 12223.49s]  How are you supposed to eat it?
[12223.49s -> 12244.02s]  How do you eat this?
[12244.02s -> 12247.47s]  Fine dining.
[12247.47s -> 12250.54s]  Plate was $180.
[12250.54s -> 12252.91s]  You shave it into strips, you idiot.
[12252.91s -> 12254.91s]  Why didn't Mama not do that?
[12254.91s -> 12259.78s]  That was an inch and a half thick cut.
[12259.78s -> 12261.78s]  I'm the idiot.
[12261.78s -> 12263.78s]  I'm sure it's not Mama's instructions
[12263.78s -> 12274.46s]  and Mama's bad recipe.
[12274.46s -> 12276.46s]  You consume it as an enema.
[12276.46s -> 12286.45s]  I should go to a restaurant.
[12286.45s -> 12288.75s]  Yeah, I'll take the bonito.
[12288.75s -> 12290.75s]  How's your bonito?
[12290.75s -> 12292.75s]  Is it any good?
[12292.75s -> 12294.75s]  Well, it's one of our more famous dishes.
[12294.75s -> 12296.75s]  You're like, I'm not sure.
[12296.75s -> 12298.75s]  Let me just get an opinion here.
[12298.75s -> 12300.75s]  You look over, there's a guy like two tables over
[12300.75s -> 12302.75s]  who's like,
[12302.75s -> 12305.57s]  Hey, how's the bonito?
[12305.57s -> 12308.45s]  Fantastic.
[12308.45s -> 12310.82s]  Okay.
[12310.82s -> 12312.82s]  Too salty?
[12312.82s -> 12314.82s]  It's just perfectly, perfectly seasoned.
[12314.82s -> 12317.44s]  I'll try the bonito.
[12317.44s -> 12324.86s]  Oh, bruschette.
[12324.86s -> 12329.73s]  What is bruschette?
[12329.73s -> 12335.55s]  Oh, dude, bruschette's the hottest
[12335.55s -> 12337.55s]  fucking food in the world. You could kill somebody
[12337.55s -> 12339.55s]  with this loaf of red meat.
[12339.55s -> 12361.10s]  Thinly sliced.
[12361.10s -> 12363.10s]  This conversation wouldn't have happened in Chibi
[12363.10s -> 12365.10s]  Robo. Yes, it would have.
[12365.10s -> 12368.94s]  Why are you giving...
[12368.94s -> 12370.94s]  You're giving a lot of credit
[12370.94s -> 12372.94s]  to the fact that we would have this same conversation
[12372.94s -> 12374.94s]  in Chibi... There's a cooking mission
[12374.94s -> 12376.94s]  in Chibi Robo. Isn't there?
[12376.94s -> 12384.62s]  Cooking Chibi Robo? Don't you
[12384.62s -> 12386.62s]  make food for the family and stuff? I can't wait
[12386.62s -> 12399.68s]  to play it. God damn it, Jeremy.
[12399.68s -> 12401.68s]  Get it right.
[12401.68s -> 12406.16s]  It's I hope we never part.
[12406.16s -> 12408.16s]  Get it right or pay the price.
[12408.16s -> 12419.04s]  Up in two pieces.
[12419.04s -> 12424.42s]  Ooh, I love asparagus.
[12424.42s -> 12426.91s]  This is... That's a huge
[12426.91s -> 12440.03s]  asparagus. Shiitake.
[12440.03s -> 12454.03s]  Onya. Worst joke
[12454.03s -> 12456.03s]  in the night. By far.
[12456.03s -> 12458.03s]  Like, by far.
[12458.03s -> 12460.03s]  That was so bad. I'll
[12460.03s -> 12462.85s]  take that one.
[12462.85s -> 12467.52s]  That was really bad.
[12467.52s -> 12469.52s]  Wait, you roll the onion into the meat?
[12469.52s -> 12471.52s]  You roll the mushrooms into the meat?
[12471.52s -> 12474.08s]  Hold on a second.
[12474.08s -> 12476.08s]  It's a thinly sliced piece of
[12476.08s -> 12478.08s]  meat, like beef or steak.
[12478.08s -> 12480.08s]  And you put a big chunk of onion in
[12480.08s -> 12482.08s]  and you roll it up.
[12482.08s -> 12487.90s]  Why have I not eaten this yet?
[12487.90s -> 12489.90s]  I think I would really like this.
[12489.90s -> 12493.62s]  And you place it on a stick
[12493.62s -> 12497.58s]  in the same order.
[12497.58s -> 12499.58s]  So it's almost like a kebab?
[12499.58s -> 12503.66s]  Okay, so...
[12503.66s -> 12507.57s]  What the hell are you talking about?
[12507.57s -> 12510.06s]  Wait, I'm supposed to guess?
[12510.06s -> 12523.62s]  No, take that off.
[12523.62s -> 12533.86s]  Why are you making me guess, Mom?
[12533.86s -> 12535.86s]  I really thought I was going to get a first try here.
[12535.86s -> 12540.46s]  Wait, it's the same every time, isn't it?
[12540.46s -> 12542.46s]  Oh, okay. Right. I thought they switched
[12542.46s -> 12550.27s]  it up on you.
[12550.27s -> 12559.94s]  One more. Thoughts on the democratic debate.
[12559.94s -> 12561.94s]  Ah! Eh! Eh! Eh!
[12561.94s -> 12592.51s]  Turn it! God, it's like
[12592.51s -> 12594.51s]  sucks being the grill guy, you know what I mean?
[12594.51s -> 12596.51s]  Like, I don't want to fuck up everybody's food at the party.
[12596.51s -> 12598.51s]  But I'm not qualified to be over here.
[12598.51s -> 12601.26s]  I'm the only one that said I just raised my hand
[12601.26s -> 12603.26s]  when somebody said, hey, who can get on the fucking grill?
[12603.26s -> 12605.70s]  Oh, there's like
[12605.70s -> 12607.70s]  a hundred people here that I could fucking poison.
[12607.70s -> 12610.19s]  It's great. Put me on.
[12610.19s -> 12622.67s]  Don't eat that one. No, no, no, no.
[12622.67s -> 12624.67s]  Don't eat that one. Throw it in the trash.
[12624.67s -> 12633.38s]  Throw it in the trash.
[12633.38s -> 12635.38s]  This hurts the old arm here.
[12635.38s -> 12641.26s]  By the way, why are we in like
[12641.26s -> 12643.26s]  14th century England?
[12643.26s -> 12645.26s]  Where's like the
[12645.26s -> 12647.26s]  propane or the fucking charcoal?
[12647.26s -> 12672.80s]  I didn't even cook this one.
[12672.80s -> 12689.31s]  It just started rotting.
[12689.31s -> 12691.31s]  Did you use your other hand? No, I'm a brighty.
[12691.31s -> 12698.29s]  Propane and propane accessories.
[12698.29s -> 12701.36s]  Actually, I wonder
[12701.36s -> 12703.36s]  how dividing this
[12703.36s -> 12705.66s]  will be.
[12705.66s -> 12707.66s]  I like a grilled food,
[12707.66s -> 12709.66s]  right? I'm a big fan
[12709.66s -> 12711.66s]  more than propane. I like charcoal
[12711.66s -> 12713.66s]  more than propane.
[12713.66s -> 12717.38s]  I think charcoal tastes better.
[12717.38s -> 12719.38s]  Alright, is that
[12719.38s -> 12721.38s]  weird?
[12721.38s -> 12725.20s]  Alright, that's it.
[12725.20s -> 12727.20s]  Let's eat pan-fried lobster.
[12727.20s -> 12729.20s]  Everybody agrees with that. Alright.
[12729.20s -> 12731.20s]  Some people are like, no, man.
[12734.83s -> 12748.51s]  Jesus.
[12748.51s -> 12752.03s]  Why did I cut his arms off first?
[12752.03s -> 12760.22s]  There's a lot of things here.
[12760.22s -> 12770.21s]  White powder, white powder.
[12770.21s -> 12775.82s]  Uh,
[12775.82s -> 12777.82s]  Pokémon 1, Pokémon
[12777.82s -> 12779.82s]  2, and then
[12779.82s -> 12789.87s]  Pokémon 3.
[12789.87s -> 12793.90s]  Now, that's the worst joke.
[12793.90s -> 12801.97s]  You're getting it. You understand.
[12801.97s -> 12803.97s]  That's the cover up of the last one.
[12803.97s -> 12805.97s]  You'll remember that one. You won't remember the other one.
[12807.97s -> 12809.97s]  Just fucking complete and total
[12809.97s -> 12811.97s]  tactics.
[12813.97s -> 12817.94s]  Everyone's going to be like,
[12817.94s -> 12819.94s]  dude, remember the Pokémon
[12819.94s -> 12821.94s]  green joke thing?
[12821.94s -> 12823.94s]  It was so bad.
[12823.94s -> 12825.94s]  Alright, dude, that was not funny.
[12825.94s -> 12827.94s]  Yeah, and then you're not going to talk about the other one.
[12827.94s -> 12834.02s]  But I win.
[12834.02s -> 12837.15s]  I win.
[12843.38s -> 12850.67s]  The house always wins.
[12850.67s -> 12857.46s]  I really eat
[12857.46s -> 12859.46s]  grilled lobster or like
[12859.46s -> 12861.46s]  pan-fried lobster.
[12861.46s -> 12863.46s]  I'm actually not a huge fan of
[12863.46s -> 12865.46s]  lobster, but usually
[12865.46s -> 12867.46s]  I don't eat it like that.
[12867.46s -> 12869.46s]  I know
[12869.46s -> 12871.46s]  it's a really popular way to eat it, but
[12871.46s -> 12873.46s]  I don't eat like grilled or pan-fried lobster.
[12875.46s -> 12878.90s]  Alright, let's serve it.
[12878.90s -> 12924.14s]  Why is dessert
[12924.14s -> 12926.14s]  on the same plate? I don't get it.
[12926.14s -> 12940.61s]  He doesn't know?
[12943.10s -> 12945.10s]  I mean, why would you... Dessert on the same plate
[12945.10s -> 12947.10s]  just seems... You get like lobster juice
[12947.10s -> 12949.10s]  in your flan. Aren't you going to be a little upset?
[12949.10s -> 12958.13s]  You don't like lobster?
[12958.13s -> 12960.13s]  Where are you actually from?
[12960.13s -> 12962.13s]  I don't hate it.
[12962.13s -> 12964.13s]  I would prefer crab.
[12964.13s -> 12966.13s]  I like crab more than lobster.
[12966.13s -> 12968.13s]  Lobster.
[12968.13s -> 12970.13s]  Wherever it is.
[12970.13s -> 12972.88s]  Alright, we're moving on.
[12972.88s -> 12975.18s]  How much do we have left?
[12975.18s -> 12977.18s]  Pettuccini.
[12977.18s -> 12980.19s]  Tortilla.
[12982.19s -> 12984.19s]  We've done a shitload of these.
[12986.19s -> 12988.19s]  Whitefish manure.
[12988.19s -> 12991.20s]  Meatloaf with sausage?
[12991.20s -> 12993.20s]  I thought this was like a raspberry pound cake.
[12993.20s -> 12995.76s]  Let's do the whitefish manure.
[12995.76s -> 13005.73s]  Menure.
[13005.73s -> 13007.73s]  Menure? Menoir? How do you say it?
[13007.73s -> 13009.73s]  How do you phonetically pronounce it?
[13009.73s -> 13011.73s]  Manoir?
[13011.73s -> 13013.73s]  Manoir?
[13013.73s -> 13015.73s]  Mou-nier?
[13015.73s -> 13018.42s]  Mou-nier?
[13018.42s -> 13020.42s]  Mou-nier. Mou-nier.
[13022.42s -> 13026.38s]  Whitefish manure.
[13026.38s -> 13030.22s]  It's garlic in everything.
[13030.22s -> 13032.22s]  Imagine if you were like allergic to fucking garlic.
[13032.22s -> 13034.22s]  You would never be able to eat food.
[13034.22s -> 13036.22s]  It's put in everything.
[13040.06s -> 13046.08s]  Oh, salt.
[13048.45s -> 13050.45s]  Nearly finished.
[13050.45s -> 13052.45s]  Flatfish.
[13052.45s -> 13054.45s]  Go for it.
[13054.45s -> 13056.45s]  Ooh.
[13056.45s -> 13058.45s]  Filling up the skin.
[13061.01s -> 13063.70s]  That easy, apparently.
[13067.73s -> 13069.73s]  Better than mama.
[13069.73s -> 13071.97s]  Whitefish manure.
[13071.97s -> 13073.97s]  Add to the milk?
[13073.97s -> 13079.54s]  Soak
[13079.54s -> 13094.26s]  fish in milk.
[13094.26s -> 13096.88s]  I won't be eating this anytime soon.
[13096.88s -> 13099.12s]  I will not be ordering
[13099.12s -> 13101.12s]  whitefish manure.
[13101.12s -> 13111.42s]  I don't think I will.
[13111.42s -> 13113.42s]  What does this taste like?
[13113.42s -> 13119.76s]  Shake the milk and then
[13119.76s -> 13121.76s]  flour the flour? Is it fried?
[13130.46s -> 13136.10s]  Somebody just fucked with me.
[13136.10s -> 13139.23s]  Somebody fucked with me.
[13139.23s -> 13141.23s]  That's like I took the salt
[13141.23s -> 13143.23s]  shaker. I'm going to put some salt on
[13143.23s -> 13145.23s]  and the whole thing comes out like the
[13145.23s -> 13147.23s]  shitty prank.
[13147.23s -> 13154.34s]  Somebody pranked me.
[13154.34s -> 13158.43s]  So bad.
[13173.73s -> 13175.73s]  Alright, now we pan fry
[13175.73s -> 13177.73s]  our milk fish.
[13177.73s -> 13181.18s]  Milk and flour.
[13181.18s -> 13186.05s]  I mean, I guess that's not super
[13186.05s -> 13188.05s]  weird. I guess it's not weird or anything.
[13188.05s -> 13190.05s]  It's just kind of different.
[13190.05s -> 13192.05s]  Although you
[13192.05s -> 13194.05s]  soak it in the milk. You don't just like
[13194.05s -> 13196.05s]  lay it in there for a second. You soak it.
[13198.05s -> 13200.05s]  It's two different fishes.
[13200.05s -> 13210.34s]  What about the bones?
[13210.34s -> 13214.80s]  There's a void there.
[13216.80s -> 13220.13s]  There it is.
[13220.13s -> 13222.13s]  It's how you make fried chicken.
[13222.13s -> 13224.13s]  I think chicken is a little different than fish. I don't know if I'd want
[13224.13s -> 13226.13s]  milk on fish.
[13226.13s -> 13230.91s]  I don't know about this.
[13230.91s -> 13233.28s]  Something about this is weird.
[13233.28s -> 13235.65s]  No new American dishes
[13235.65s -> 13239.49s]  by the way.
[13239.49s -> 13241.49s]  Oh!
[13241.49s -> 13243.79s]  Bulabase.
[13243.79s -> 13247.44s]  Bulabase.
[13247.44s -> 13251.22s]  French bulabase.
[13251.22s -> 13253.71s]  Bulabase.
[13253.71s -> 13263.25s]  Bulabase.
[13263.25s -> 13272.96s]  Scallops.
[13272.96s -> 13275.78s]  Scallop, huh?
[13275.78s -> 13277.78s]  It's like the only little thing you know.
[13279.78s -> 13282.53s]  You're using a chisel to get a scallop?
[13284.70s -> 13295.44s]  What fish is that?
[13295.44s -> 13297.44s]  It's like Stardew Valley fish. What was that?
[13297.44s -> 13301.09s]  What animal is this?
[13301.09s -> 13303.09s]  It's weird meat.
[13305.09s -> 13307.09s]  Round like red animal.
[13310.54s -> 13335.68s]  Why are you farming?
[13335.68s -> 13337.68s]  I don't know because it's fun.
[13340.94s -> 13343.95s]  Why am I cooking a tail?
[13343.95s -> 13349.65s]  You don't eat the tail?
[13349.65s -> 13351.65s]  Why do you need three salt shakers? I don't know.
[13351.65s -> 13353.65s]  Ask mama. It's her house.
[13356.14s -> 13366.83s]  I use the spices to
[13366.83s -> 13368.83s]  flavor the spices.
[13368.83s -> 13370.83s]  How do I pronounce this?
[13370.83s -> 13373.46s]  How do you actually pronounce it?
[13373.46s -> 13384.58s]  Bulabase.
[13384.58s -> 13387.52s]  Bulabase.
[13387.52s -> 13389.70s]  Bulabase.
[13389.70s -> 13392.77s]  Come on!
[13392.77s -> 13396.99s]  Bulabase.
[13396.99s -> 13403.90s]  Bulabase.
[13403.90s -> 13407.62s]  Bulabase.
[13407.62s -> 13409.62s]  Bulabase.
[13409.62s -> 13412.56s]  Bulabase.
[13412.56s -> 13425.22s]  The bulabase is
[13425.22s -> 13429.89s]  silent.
[13429.89s -> 13433.15s]  I think I've had this before.
[13433.15s -> 13435.15s]  Yeah, I've eaten this before.
[13435.15s -> 13437.39s]  This is delicious.
[13437.39s -> 13439.39s]  There's like a bunch of seafood, like that tomato base.
[13439.39s -> 13441.39s]  It's fantastic. I've had this before.
[13441.39s -> 13447.15s]  It's alive? No, it's not.
[13447.15s -> 13450.03s]  Kim ordered it and I tried it.
[13450.03s -> 13452.03s]  I had like three or four sips of the broth and I tried like one of those scallops and shit.
[13460.86s -> 13463.49s]  Kim, you're so worldly
[13463.49s -> 13465.49s]  and cultured.
[13472.02s -> 13480.51s]  I thought that was American.
[13480.51s -> 13482.51s]  I thought it was going to be like a Cobb salad.
[13482.51s -> 13490.70s]  Crudite?
[13490.70s -> 13492.70s]  It is a Cobb salad.
[13492.70s -> 13494.70s]  What is this?
[13494.70s -> 13498.16s]  Remove the yolk. Alright.
[13498.16s -> 13538.91s]  I caught it! You're kind of losing me here.
[13538.91s -> 13542.37s]  Eggs and vinegar?
[13542.37s -> 13549.47s]  That's a lot of vinegar.
[13549.47s -> 13551.47s]  You know like the way that raw eggs smell?
[13551.47s -> 13553.78s]  Now imagine
[13553.78s -> 13555.78s]  raw eggs and vinegar
[13555.78s -> 13561.15s]  in the same...
[13561.15s -> 13563.15s]  That's mayo? That's not mayo.
[13563.15s -> 13574.80s]  Mayo's oil. I mean, no.
[13588.30s -> 13596.56s]  Old men like peppers.
[13596.56s -> 13604.24s]  It's a stable
[13604.24s -> 13606.24s]  emulsion of oil, egg yolk, and an acidity of vinegar
[13606.24s -> 13608.24s]  or lemon juice.
[13608.24s -> 13610.48s]  Give it like a tiny bit.
[13610.48s -> 13612.48s]  Like only a little bit of lemon juice.
[13612.48s -> 13614.48s]  You don't like dump half the bottle in like she was.
[13614.48s -> 13618.77s]  Cutting is satisfying.
[13618.77s -> 13622.54s]  It really is.
[13622.54s -> 13624.54s]  Red pepper, yellow pepper,
[13624.54s -> 13628.45s]  and onion.
[13628.45s -> 13630.45s]  Maybe it's a lot of mayo.
[13632.45s -> 13634.45s]  Making an egg salad.
[13634.45s -> 13636.62s]  I love egg salad.
[13643.54s -> 13650.83s]  Oh, this is the last pieces for some reason.
[13650.83s -> 13662.67s]  I do.
[13662.67s -> 13664.67s]  I acknowledge it looks gross.
[13664.67s -> 13666.67s]  If you make egg salad
[13666.67s -> 13668.67s]  chunky enough, it looks a lot more
[13668.67s -> 13670.67s]  appetizing than if you make it paste.
[13670.67s -> 13682.83s]  Put a little bit of dill in there too.
[13682.83s -> 13684.83s]  You make it look not just like a paste.
[13684.83s -> 13690.83s]  You can go south real easily.
[13690.83s -> 13692.83s]  Well, you gotta eat it within a couple of days.
[13692.83s -> 13695.84s]  You can really get into trouble
[13695.84s -> 13697.84s]  with egg salad if you make it and you make a bunch of it
[13697.84s -> 13699.84s]  and then a week and a half goes by.
[13699.84s -> 13702.02s]  And you go,
[13702.02s -> 13704.02s]  oh man, I really want some of that egg salad.
[13704.02s -> 13706.51s]  And you open the fridge
[13706.51s -> 13708.51s]  and now your whole house smells like rotten egg.
[13710.51s -> 13720.80s]  Okay, here we go.
[13720.80s -> 13725.79s]  I don't know what this is.
[13725.79s -> 13728.54s]  It's like a salad
[13728.54s -> 13750.11s]  of some sort.
[13750.11s -> 13772.30s]  I've never had this.
[13772.30s -> 13778.38s]  Like, I wanna, fuck it, I don't even care.
[13778.38s -> 13797.20s]  You're really gonna have to
[13797.20s -> 13807.38s]  fucking find it, you know what I mean?
[13807.38s -> 13811.73s]  You really gotta search for it in there.
[13811.73s -> 13813.73s]  It's a nest
[13813.73s -> 13815.73s]  for an egg.
[13815.73s -> 13817.73s]  It's an egg nest.
[13817.73s -> 13825.66s]  That's a stand up and leave
[13825.66s -> 13827.66s]  the restaurant kind of presentation.
[13827.66s -> 13830.42s]  That's a like,
[13830.42s -> 13833.68s]  excuse me,
[13833.68s -> 13836.43s]  what is this?
[13836.43s -> 13838.43s]  Is this gonna get fixed or
[13838.43s -> 13840.43s]  I don't want to check or anything
[13840.43s -> 13845.87s]  after this.
[13845.87s -> 13847.87s]  Let's make the raspberry pound cake.
[13847.87s -> 13857.52s]  Crack the egg.
[13857.52s -> 13860.53s]  Where's the American food?
[13860.53s -> 13862.53s]  Oh, I'm with you. I really am.
[13862.53s -> 13864.53s]  I've been playing it for this long because I want to see
[13864.53s -> 13874.64s]  what the American food is.
[13874.64s -> 13885.38s]  Bonus.
[13885.38s -> 13888.70s]  Fried butter.
[13888.70s -> 13890.70s]  Meatloaf with sausage.
[13890.70s -> 13893.26s]  Alright, let's go. Onion.
[13893.26s -> 13897.62s]  Chop it up.
[13899.62s -> 13902.24s]  What are we gonna make? Burgers?
[13902.24s -> 13904.24s]  We made burger before, but it was a long time ago.
[13904.24s -> 13909.10s]  I don't know that American cuisine
[13909.10s -> 13911.10s]  is not just hamburgers.
[13911.10s -> 13913.66s]  It's the rest of the menu
[13913.66s -> 13915.66s]  at that restaurant, which is 12 different burgers.
[13915.66s -> 13917.66s]  We've got a cheese burger.
[13917.66s -> 13919.66s]  A barbecue sauce
[13919.66s -> 13921.66s]  and onion rings burger.
[13921.66s -> 13923.66s]  A macaroni
[13923.66s -> 13925.66s]  and cheese burger.
[13925.66s -> 13927.66s]  It's not just hamburger.
[13927.66s -> 13932.51s]  And they all have really cool names.
[13932.51s -> 13934.51s]  Like we name it like, you know,
[13934.51s -> 13936.51s]  like the super juicer.
[13936.51s -> 13938.51s]  And it's like a fucking lettuce with like two
[13938.51s -> 13940.51s]  eggs on it.
[13940.51s -> 13942.51s]  Oh, the lazy sundae.
[13942.51s -> 13944.51s]  It's like two patties with
[13944.51s -> 13946.51s]  two pieces of bacon and like
[13946.51s -> 13948.51s]  a couple of hash browns on it.
[13948.51s -> 13950.51s]  Wait, that's American.
[13950.51s -> 13952.51s]  Where are all those?
[13952.51s -> 13968.11s]  I want that garlic in here.
[13968.11s -> 13970.11s]  Come on, onions.
[13970.11s -> 13973.70s]  Alright, whatever.
[13973.70s -> 13976.38s]  Make the webcam wider.
[13976.38s -> 13978.38s]  You wish you could see what was going on over here, don't you?
[13978.38s -> 13995.20s]  How's that?
[13995.20s -> 13997.20s]  Alright, meatloaf with sausage.
[14007.68s -> 14009.68s]  There's a whole wall of streaming trophies.
[14009.68s -> 14013.76s]  I would kill
[14013.76s -> 14015.76s]  the smell of some onions in a pan right now.
[14017.76s -> 14022.94s]  I mean, you probably have
[14022.94s -> 14024.94s]  onions in your house.
[14024.94s -> 14027.25s]  You could make that happen right now
[14027.25s -> 14029.25s]  if you really wanted to.
[14029.25s -> 14031.25s]  Onions are in every house.
[14031.25s -> 14035.41s]  You can just go do that.
[14035.41s -> 14037.41s]  Just go do it.
[14037.41s -> 14039.41s]  Chop up some onions.
[14039.41s -> 14041.41s]  Sizzle them up in a pan with a little oil.
[14043.41s -> 14046.03s]  Put it on like a bologna cheese sandwich.
[14046.03s -> 14048.03s]  Who cares?
[14048.03s -> 14050.03s]  Just eat it.
[14050.03s -> 14067.31s]  Where's the American food?
[14072.18s -> 14076.85s]  How would you ruin a perfectly good sandwich like that?
[14078.85s -> 14080.85s]  What's wrong with that?
[14080.85s -> 14082.85s]  Onions are good.
[14082.85s -> 14085.98s]  What the hell was that?
[14085.98s -> 14090.78s]  What am I doing?
[14090.78s -> 14097.23s]  Hot dogs?
[14097.23s -> 14104.34s]  What are those?
[14106.51s -> 14109.97s]  This would be a really heavy lunch.
[14109.97s -> 14111.97s]  Oh, sausages.
[14111.97s -> 14113.97s]  They don't look like sausages.
[14113.97s -> 14115.97s]  They look weird.
[14117.97s -> 14119.97s]  You're hiding turds.
[14139.41s -> 14142.35s]  What do you say it looks like?
[14142.35s -> 14148.82s]  Kitty litter.
[14150.82s -> 14158.43s]  Cut it?
[14158.43s -> 14160.43s]  I don't know if I like this.
[14160.43s -> 14167.22s]  This is weird cartoon food.
[14167.22s -> 14169.22s]  Serve as much as you like. Isn't it just the brick?
[14169.22s -> 14185.60s]  I would eat two of these.
[14185.60s -> 14189.12s]  Two would make sense.
[14193.39s -> 14235.18s]  I'm trying to make it actually presenting.
[14244.38s -> 14246.38s]  Yeah, it does look like Fancy Feast.
[14246.38s -> 14249.26s]  Somebody said cat food.
[14249.26s -> 14251.26s]  It looks like
[14251.26s -> 14253.26s]  when you turn the can, it just
[14253.26s -> 14256.59s]  Fancy Feast?
[14256.59s -> 14258.59s]  And they have that big, huge, white, fuzzy-ass cat?
[14268.77s -> 14270.77s]  What they don't show in that commercial
[14270.77s -> 14273.20s]  is Fancy Feast.
[14273.20s -> 14275.20s]  Oh, cat's going to love you.
[14275.20s -> 14277.20s]  And the goblet and the cat's like...
[14277.20s -> 14279.20s]  What they don't show is the mom
[14279.20s -> 14281.20s]  going...
[14281.20s -> 14283.20s]  Oh, more hair in my mouth.
[14283.20s -> 14285.20s]  There's hair all over my mouth.
[14285.20s -> 14287.20s]  They don't show that part.
[14287.20s -> 14293.47s]  That's real life for the cat like that.
[14293.47s -> 14300.45s]  Yeah, they don't show the mom
[14300.45s -> 14302.45s]  walking over with a tray of Fancy Feast.
[14306.75s -> 14308.75s]  Okay, here you go, honey.
[14308.75s -> 14324.05s]  He's not licking the cat.
[14324.05s -> 14327.31s]  It's just in the air.
[14327.31s -> 14340.24s]  Just because an animal licks you
[14340.24s -> 14351.57s]  doesn't mean you should look at that.
[14356.30s -> 14363.92s]  No, that's not a joke. He's correct.
[14363.92s -> 14365.92s]  I know.
[14365.92s -> 14367.92s]  But people are saying that I'm licking a cat.
[14367.92s -> 14369.92s]  That's not what it is.
[14369.92s -> 14385.58s]  What am I saying?
[14385.58s -> 14387.58s]  I'm saying that there's hair everywhere.
[14387.58s -> 14397.31s]  But it's just real life.
[14397.31s -> 14399.31s]  That's just what you have to do.
[14399.31s -> 14401.94s]  Yeah.
[14401.94s -> 14405.65s]  Brush your cat, even if you brush.
[14405.65s -> 14418.43s]  I'm normal.
[14418.43s -> 14429.18s]  That's a lot of vegetables.
[14429.18s -> 14431.94s]  Spread them out. We need the olive oil.
[14431.94s -> 14435.58s]  Yeah, get it in there.
[14435.58s -> 14437.58s]  Come on, eggplant. Fuck you.
[14437.58s -> 14450.96s]  Let Bugleberry play.
[14450.96s -> 14453.52s]  No. Absolutely not.
[14453.52s -> 14478.91s]  Wink.
[14478.91s -> 14480.91s]  You're going to lose 500 viewers
[14480.91s -> 14482.91s]  just mentioning Bugleberry.
[14482.91s -> 14485.98s]  It's bound to happen, actually.
[14485.98s -> 14489.12s]  You're right.
[14489.12s -> 14491.12s]  I thought winking was over. No, in three days it's over.
[14491.12s -> 14493.74s]  Alright, American.
[14493.74s -> 14496.05s]  American cuisine.
[14496.05s -> 14499.50s]  Mac and cheese.
[14499.50s -> 14506.93s]  Mac and cheese.
[14506.93s -> 14517.94s]  Do you want to do them all?
[14517.94s -> 14521.26s]  Fettuccine. Ooh, I love fettuccine.
[14521.26s -> 14531.57s]  Fettuccine is amazing.
[14531.57s -> 14537.71s]  The best part about fettuccine is when
[14537.71s -> 14539.71s]  you're done.
[14539.71s -> 14541.71s]  Oh, now I want fettuccine.
[14541.71s -> 14543.71s]  We're going to have to do a poll after this.
[14543.71s -> 14546.78s]  So when you have
[14546.78s -> 14548.78s]  fettuccine alfredo
[14548.78s -> 14551.02s]  and when it's all gone, the
[14551.02s -> 14553.02s]  pasta's gone, and you just have that...
[14553.02s -> 14555.02s]  You know when you eat cereal and there's
[14555.02s -> 14557.02s]  that delicious milk at the bottom of the sugary
[14557.02s -> 14559.02s]  milk? This is the... it's the same
[14559.02s -> 14561.02s]  thing, except you dip
[14561.02s -> 14563.02s]  bread in it. It's like the milk after you eat the cereal.
[14563.02s -> 14565.02s]  It's fucking incredible.
[14565.02s -> 14567.02s]  You just use it to put bread in
[14567.02s -> 14569.02s]  and... Oh wait, but you have some other...
[14569.02s -> 14571.02s]  You're going to eat that? Let me like dip that and use
[14571.02s -> 14573.02s]  that in my fucking cereal milk. You know what I mean?
[14573.02s -> 14575.02s]  It's so amazing. I want it so
[14575.02s -> 14577.65s]  bad now.
[14577.65s -> 14582.00s]  We're going to have to do a poll.
[14582.00s -> 14585.07s]  We're going to have to do a poll tonight.
[14585.07s -> 14589.68s]  Is this a salmonella?
[14589.68s -> 14595.25s]  I defended your
[14595.25s -> 14597.25s]  cat fur a bit. I can't defend
[14597.25s -> 14599.25s]  that one. Well, you can't defend...
[14599.25s -> 14601.25s]  Eating the rest of the alfredo
[14601.25s -> 14603.25s]  at the bottom of the bowl?
[14603.25s -> 14605.81s]  Alright.
[14605.81s -> 14620.70s]  I said, why are you so out there
[14620.70s -> 14625.12s]  tonight? I'm just like having fun.
[14625.12s -> 14628.77s]  I'm just like hungry and having fun.
[14632.48s -> 14634.78s]  Oh, I think you're talking about cereal.
[14634.78s -> 14636.78s]  Look at how much... how many steps there are in this.
[14636.78s -> 14640.69s]  Don't touch my food.
[14640.69s -> 14642.69s]  Don't worry, I won't.
[14647.62s -> 14654.14s]  Oh no.
[14654.14s -> 14656.70s]  When are we going to get a real life cooking stream?
[14656.70s -> 14658.70s]  I don't know.
[14658.70s -> 14662.59s]  I don't know. We never will.
[14666.86s -> 14668.86s]  Alright, here we go.
[14668.86s -> 14671.68s]  Pasta time. The best part.
[14671.68s -> 14687.23s]  Yeah, we're going to do a food poll after this.
[14687.23s -> 14692.54s]  This is the most important
[14692.54s -> 14694.54s]  thing the entire day, by the way.
[14694.54s -> 14696.78s]  Is what
[14696.78s -> 14698.78s]  food am I going to go eat?
[14698.78s -> 14700.78s]  It's the most important thing the whole day.
[14700.78s -> 14704.43s]  What are the choices?
[14704.43s -> 14707.38s]  You'll see. You'll see.
[14709.38s -> 14711.38s]  Calamari will not be on the list.
[14722.11s -> 14724.11s]  Vote for squid. You're not going to vote for something
[14724.11s -> 14726.11s]  that's not on the part of the ballot.
[14726.11s -> 14736.86s]  Has reservations about cooking stream
[14736.86s -> 14738.86s]  but will get slimed in a diaper
[14738.86s -> 14744.94s]  for two and a half hours. So?
[14765.54s -> 14772.26s]  Vote for durian fruit.
[14772.26s -> 14781.60s]  Vote for durian fruit.
[14781.60s -> 14783.60s]  I can't wait for some nice American cuisine.
[14783.60s -> 14788.02s]  Watch the next one just be
[14788.02s -> 14790.02s]  Oh, a new American cuisine unlocked.
[14790.02s -> 14792.02s]  Bag of Cheetos.
[14792.02s -> 14794.19s]  And it's just
[14794.19s -> 14796.19s]  pull with Wiimote to the left
[14796.19s -> 14798.19s]  and you open them.
[14798.19s -> 14800.88s]  And then you just dump them on a plate.
[14800.88s -> 14802.88s]  Alright, that's great. Now this is going to be cheese.
[14802.88s -> 14804.88s]  See? I told you.
[14804.88s -> 14808.02s]  Party clogs? Fuck you.
[14808.02s -> 14816.51s]  He hates foreign food.
[14820.51s -> 14822.51s]  I just told you.
[14822.51s -> 14824.82s]  There's a pizza crust.
[14824.82s -> 14828.91s]  Mmm. Pizza's pretty good too.
[14828.91s -> 14830.91s]  But I gotta start. Yeah, I guess he likes the pizza.
[14830.91s -> 14832.91s]  Trying to cut back
[14832.91s -> 14834.91s]  on just all
[14834.91s -> 14836.91s]  the bread and cheese and stuff.
[14836.91s -> 14838.91s]  Although that's pasta.
[14838.91s -> 14843.33s]  Whatever.
[14843.33s -> 14850.75s]  Pizza's kind of dull.
[14850.75s -> 14852.75s]  It's not that it's dull or anything. It's just
[14852.75s -> 14855.31s]  you know exactly
[14855.31s -> 14857.31s]  what it's going to be when you get it.
[14857.31s -> 14859.55s]  There's no surprise anymore.
[14859.55s -> 14861.55s]  This is pizza and I know exactly what it is
[14861.55s -> 14863.55s]  and it's just I'm doing it because I'm doing it.
[14863.55s -> 14867.07s]  How is this overcooked?
[14867.07s -> 14869.50s]  It needs some adventure.
[14869.50s -> 14878.58s]  Just order a different kind of pizza.
[14878.58s -> 14881.26s]  But why would you
[14881.26s -> 14883.26s]  ever order anything besides a pepperoni
[14883.26s -> 14885.26s]  thin crust pizza? There's no other pizzas. I'm sorry.
[14885.26s -> 14899.47s]  They don't exist.
[14899.47s -> 14908.88s]  That heat up.
[14908.88s -> 14910.88s]  I would send you a can of Sir Stromming, but it might be
[14910.88s -> 14914.02s]  a
[14914.02s -> 14925.66s]  I wouldn't eat Sir Stromming.
[14925.66s -> 14936.16s]  Powered.
[14936.16s -> 14939.42s]  That shit would get in the walls. Thick crust.
[14939.42s -> 14941.42s]  No, not thick crust. I don't like thick crust.
[14941.42s -> 14943.42s]  No! Where's the American
[14943.42s -> 14945.42s]  macaroni and cheese?
[14945.42s -> 14950.48s]  I know you have it in here.

[14982.77s -> 14985.33s]  JPG.
[14985.33s -> 14988.53s]  Scallops.
[14988.53s -> 14990.53s]  Why are there scallops in my sushi?
[14990.53s -> 14995.01s]  I don't want this.
[15001.90s -> 15003.90s]  I wanted a tuna roll. I wanted a spicy tuna roll.
[15003.90s -> 15010.30s]  I don't want scallops.
[15010.30s -> 15013.25s]  Is this a durian?
[15013.25s -> 15020.59s]  That is a durian.

[15045.06s -> 15047.06s]  Tuna sashimi.
[15047.06s -> 15049.06s]  Salmon sashimi.
[15049.06s -> 15051.06s]  Just over the rice. I'm okay with that.
