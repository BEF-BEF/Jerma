[22.90s -> 29.53s]  Hello, how are you? Early stream? Hmm, earlier. Earlier.
[29.53s -> 46.74s]  I hope everybody had a good 4th of July. That sounded like I just sipped a bunch of whipped cream off.
[46.74s -> 51.25s]  Well, I don't even care. That's a new me.
[51.25s -> 54.15s]  I'm not gonna do something that sounds weird and then explain it for five minutes.
[54.15s -> 71.37s]  No, it's a new me. New me. Yes, you will, probably.
[71.37s -> 73.47s]  And in pre-stream earlier, somebody was saying,
[73.47s -> 82.24s]  Oh man, I... What if it happened to the... That like, jacked, like wicked red Jerma.
[82.24s -> 92.76s]  Man, like what happened to him? I just want to say, welcome 25 to 35. Good luck.
[92.76s -> 108.15s]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, 25 to 35. Okay. We'll see. New? You're old.
[108.15s -> 117.96s]  They were just joking? As am I. As am I. Don't worry, we're all joking here.
[117.96s -> 120.60s]  So today we're playing with Ster. Ster is here.
[120.60s -> 128.76s]  I don't want to introduce him yet because I want it to be a big surprise when he shows up.
[128.76s -> 134.89s]  The plan today, Ster was like, hey, this is a game called Hail Card. Looks pretty cool.
[134.89s -> 137.79s]  I was like, yeah, I'll get it. So I got it.
[137.79s -> 144.80s]  We also have two other games that we might move to. Maybe not. We'll see.
[144.80s -> 151.02s]  I didn't mean it in a bad way. No, I know. I'm just kidding around too.
[151.02s -> 156.28s]  I have a very important question for Ster. Actually, a couple.
[156.28s -> 161.49s]  Hey, I have a couple questions for you. Oh, yeah.
[161.49s -> 168.96s]  Question number one, what temperature do you put your thermostat on a hot day?
[168.96s -> 175.11s]  That's a really complicated variable question. It is. I know it's loaded.
[175.11s -> 178.65s]  Because in the winter, I was explaining this the other day,
[178.65s -> 182.25s]  you got to set it at a certain temperature at which the AC triggers,
[182.25s -> 185.62s]  not the temperature you actually want it.
[185.72s -> 188.02s]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[188.02s -> 192.92s]  So like in the summer, if I turn on the AC and put it at like 78,
[192.92s -> 194.62s]  it'll trigger and it'll be really cold in here.
[194.62s -> 199.52s]  But in the winter, if I put it at like 72, that's when it'll, I don't know.
[199.52s -> 203.52s]  That's what you mean. But you said 78.
[203.52s -> 205.92s]  Well, I don't think it's actually 78 in here.
[205.92s -> 210.02s]  That's what I'm saying is that it's like the AC is fighting that the fact
[210.02s -> 214.26s]  that it's a hundred degrees outside and it's just on.
[214.36s -> 218.46s]  I would like a like a true thermostat because this thing, I think it's a liar.
[218.46s -> 221.66s]  You also have the same problem where the room that you are in right now
[221.66s -> 225.76s]  gets to like a hundred degrees, but then you will go out of that room
[225.76s -> 230.46s]  and the room that actually has a thermostat in it is like nice and cool.
[230.46s -> 234.26s]  Yeah. Well, that's the also if you stream in a room, it will be 80 degrees.
[234.26s -> 235.87s]  There's no way around it.
[235.87s -> 238.66s]  And those of you that have like your gamer room.
[238.66s -> 243.83s]  So I put my AC when I'm streaming 73.
[243.83s -> 250.15s]  Okay. Yeah. I usually try to keep my between 76, 75, 77.
[250.15s -> 254.65s]  Maybe if I'm not really streaming or anything, I could fill up.
[254.65s -> 256.22s]  Good answer.
[256.22s -> 262.26s]  Oh, yeah. Well, like if it was 75 or 78, this room would be 85 degrees to 90.
[262.26s -> 266.16s]  Regardless of the rest of my apartment would be cold.
[266.16s -> 267.36s]  Yeah, I put it at 73.
[267.36s -> 272.24s]  So it like continues to pump cold air in here because otherwise it doesn't care.
[272.24s -> 274.04s]  I don't exist to my AC. All right.
[274.04s -> 275.24s]  What about let me ask you this.
[275.24s -> 277.84s]  What about the I'm seeing a lot of people in chat right now.
[277.84s -> 281.44s]  And I know a lot of people in my, you know, personal life to like friends
[281.44s -> 286.58s]  and family members that say that I'm fucking nuts for having my thermostat
[286.58s -> 291.44s]  at like 77 or 76 because they like what are you talking about?
[291.44s -> 295.42s]  Like it needs to be in the low 70s or high 60s for me.
[295.42s -> 299.98s]  And to me that kind of that's kind of like a like like a freezer to me.
[299.98s -> 303.12s]  Is it to you too?
[303.12s -> 304.22s]  I don't know.
[304.22s -> 305.82s]  See, that's where it all comes down.
[305.82s -> 309.38s]  It might be 60 in the rest of my apartment sometimes,
[309.38s -> 312.18s]  even though it's set to like 73.
[312.18s -> 313.18s]  That's what I'm saying.
[313.18s -> 315.28s]  Yeah, like I don't get an even distribution.
[315.28s -> 318.28s]  If you set your thermostat to like if it's a hot day or whatever,
[318.28s -> 321.18s]  if it's like during summer and you set your thermostat to 68,
[321.18s -> 322.18s]  I'm not even sure my therm.
[322.18s -> 326.58s]  I don't think I could even get the temperature to be 70 degrees right now.
[326.58s -> 329.98s]  If I tried it's just like a hundred hundred and ten degrees out right now.
[329.98s -> 331.76s]  Hundred five, whatever it is.
[331.76s -> 334.91s]  I'm not even sure I could actually even happen.
[334.91s -> 337.31s]  Do you like going out in a hundred and five degree weather?
[337.31s -> 338.31s]  Actually, I do.
[338.31s -> 340.41s]  And that's like that makes me a weird thing too.
[340.41s -> 343.51s]  I if it's a hundred and five out, I want to go outside.
[343.51s -> 346.21s]  But then when I'm inside, it's got to be really cold.
[346.21s -> 349.21s]  If it like if it gets to like 80 90 in here, it's disgusting.
[349.21s -> 350.01s]  Can't handle that.
[350.01s -> 353.01s]  So but so you like it at like a hundred and ten outside
[353.01s -> 356.55s]  and you like it at like 70 inside.
[356.55s -> 358.45s]  Yeah, I need a refugee.
[358.45s -> 358.85s]  Okay.
[358.85s -> 358.95s]  Yeah.
[358.95s -> 361.35s]  So that's refuge.
[361.35s -> 362.15s]  I need refuge.
[362.15s -> 363.35s]  Germa.
[363.35s -> 364.75s]  Are you a lizard?
[364.75s -> 366.15s]  I like it hot.
[366.15s -> 367.45s]  I like the hot weather.
[367.45s -> 370.78s]  I actually enjoy it.
[370.78s -> 372.99s]  You two are reptiles.
[372.99s -> 377.12s]  Oh, it's going to be heating up in here.
[377.12s -> 378.92s]  I hate the heat.
[378.92s -> 383.88s]  I want to cry if it's hotter than 85.
[383.88s -> 385.08s]  Just start crying.
[385.08s -> 387.38s]  The moment it goes from 84 to 85.
[387.38s -> 389.58s]  You just start like, no, this is too much.
[389.58s -> 392.38s]  You're sitting there looking at a thermostat like, no, don't please don't.
[392.38s -> 393.48s]  It's like 84.
[393.48s -> 396.88s]  No, no, no 85.
[396.88s -> 400.12s]  But the real feel is 70.
[400.12s -> 401.72s]  72 to 73 is perfect.
[401.72s -> 403.76s]  I think.
[403.86s -> 406.78s]  Do you want to play the game that you want to play here?
[406.78s -> 409.08s]  It's funny that you phrased it like that.
[409.08s -> 415.50s]  I mean, because I feel like this is just not going to hold your attention.
[415.50s -> 418.40s]  And the first thing someone said in my chat was like, can't wait for
[418.40s -> 421.89s]  Germa to get bored of this in 30 minutes.
[421.89s -> 424.19s]  So we have two backups.
[424.19s -> 425.19s]  But here's the thing.
[425.19s -> 426.40s]  Hold on.
[426.40s -> 432.14s]  Yeah, I'm ready.
[432.14s -> 434.04s]  Okay, there's the alright.
[434.04s -> 434.94s]  I am ready.
[434.94s -> 436.54s]  You say like, you know what?
[436.54s -> 439.14s]  On one hand, I appreciate you agreeing to play this.
[439.14s -> 439.44s]  Yeah.
[439.44s -> 441.14s]  On the other hand, I wish you'd just say shut up.
[441.14s -> 442.04s]  That's I don't know.
[442.04s -> 443.14s]  I'd rather do something else.
[443.14s -> 447.63s]  Oh, like you said when I invited you to the house flipper thing on Tuesday.
[447.63s -> 448.13s]  I don't know.
[448.13s -> 452.62s]  I don't know if I'm going to be here on Tuesday.
[452.62s -> 454.12s]  I mean, I'll do it.
[454.12s -> 457.42s]  Well, no, yeah, you can't because now I can't.
[457.42s -> 459.42s]  Well, I confirmed the list.
[459.42s -> 460.32s]  I confirmed the list.
[460.32s -> 462.52s]  You couldn't add plus one to the list.
[462.52s -> 467.03s]  I could fucking your best man at your wedding.
[467.03s -> 469.63s]  Do you want I I was just messing around.
[469.63s -> 472.55s]  But do you actually have you want to do it?
[472.65s -> 473.75s]  I can know by the end of the day.
[473.75s -> 474.75s]  I'll be here on Tuesday.
[474.75s -> 479.66s]  Okay, you're going to do it and you're not here's what I think you're going to do.
[479.66s -> 483.36s]  It's everyone's timed everyone gets 70 minutes to make a house.
[483.36s -> 485.16s]  And I know you're going to do 70.
[485.16s -> 486.06s]  It's not enough time.
[486.06s -> 486.46s]  Trust me.
[486.46s -> 489.99s]  We I've tested you're going to get in there.
[489.99s -> 492.19s]  He's doing full runs to test.
[492.19s -> 492.79s]  Oh, I have a hole.
[492.79s -> 493.39s]  You're slow.
[493.39s -> 494.69s]  You're slow as shit.
[494.69s -> 498.19s]  How many times did you like stop to explain something when you were building your house?
[498.19s -> 499.99s]  Yeah, but when you're on a timer, you can't do that.
[499.99s -> 500.49s]  You got to go.
[500.49s -> 501.49s]  But here's what I think you're going to do.
[501.49s -> 503.60s]  I'm going to take your joke from you and I'm going to ruin it.
[503.60s -> 504.90s]  Okay, you're going to show up.
[505.56s -> 508.16s]  It's going to be like, all right, everybody get started and everyone's going to be so like, let's go.
[508.16s -> 508.56s]  I'm hype.
[508.56s -> 511.52s]  You're going to make a big deal about how hyped you are about this.
[511.52s -> 515.43s]  You are then going to exit house flipper and go do something else.
[515.43s -> 520.23s]  And then when your time slot is up, it's just going to be the default house.
[520.23s -> 522.17s]  It's like that you didn't even do anything.
[522.17s -> 523.27s]  I'm not going to lie.
[523.27s -> 524.57s]  That was my first idea.
[524.57s -> 525.87s]  Yeah, and it's a good idea.
[525.87s -> 529.27s]  Like I don't want to agree to do this whole thing for this one joke.
[529.27s -> 530.97s]  And it's the most predictable joke.
[530.97s -> 534.77s]  He knows I'm going to do but then I came up with joke too.
[535.07s -> 540.04s]  Still like it's still just like 60 minutes for one joke.
[540.04s -> 540.74s]  I don't know.
[540.74s -> 543.59s]  You could if you really want me in this room.
[543.59s -> 549.62s]  I mean, what is it scored on creativity complexity going to be really biased
[549.62s -> 552.22s]  because someone told me that you could like import images.
[552.22s -> 553.62s]  Yes as your wallpaper.
[553.62s -> 557.22s]  So I just feel like whoever does the drama memes on the wall is going to win.
[557.22s -> 561.47s]  If why would I I'm going to I'm going to be doing it very seriously.
[561.47s -> 563.07s]  I'm going to be taking it dead seriously.
[563.07s -> 565.57s]  It's I don't think you can creativity.
[565.57s -> 566.87s]  I don't think you can separate yourself.
[566.87s -> 569.57s]  Like once you enter a room and it's like, oh, this is the auto room
[569.57s -> 571.97s]  and it's like all dog toys and pictures of auto on the wall.
[571.97s -> 574.12s]  That person won.
[574.12s -> 575.90s]  So they didn't win.
[575.90s -> 581.72s]  They got points for philosophy because that's one of the categories.
[581.72s -> 581.92s]  Okay.
[581.92s -> 590.34s]  Yeah, there is creativity complexity structural integrity cleanliness
[590.34s -> 592.95s]  philosophy and chats grade.
[592.95s -> 602.07s]  Well, let me ask you this in your own home decor decoration type
[602.17s -> 604.07s]  strat like your own home.
[604.07s -> 606.27s]  Yeah, what how is your home decorated?
[606.27s -> 607.27s]  Do you decorate your home?
[607.27s -> 611.22s]  Do you go around like all this painting would look great in my Fourier?
[611.22s -> 612.02s]  I mean sometimes.
[612.02s -> 615.86s]  Yeah, I think when you get like a new place you kind of look around
[615.86s -> 619.77s]  and you go, all right, I could see maybe like a painting there
[619.77s -> 623.47s]  and be like a furniture piece that you do your own design philosophy
[623.47s -> 628.37s]  when you first I guess when you first move in I don't do this every day.
[628.37s -> 630.77s]  I don't walk around and go I don't walk around my you know, look at my Reddit
[630.77s -> 632.67s]  shelf and be like, hmm, what should I add?
[632.67s -> 633.47s]  I did it.
[633.47s -> 634.87s]  I did my decoration shelf.
[634.87s -> 636.17s]  I read it shelf.
[636.17s -> 638.13s]  You have a Reddit shelf.
[638.13s -> 640.93s]  It's just that's like the what everybody calls it because they make fun of me
[640.93s -> 641.63s]  for it.
[641.63s -> 644.98s]  I have a shelf that has a bunch of like trinkets on it.
[644.98s -> 649.18s]  Oh, you like framed photographs of all of your favorite comments from Reddit.
[649.18s -> 655.21s]  No, it's all my favorite stream items.
[655.21s -> 658.01s]  It's a little like pieces of memorabilia for me to remember like,
[658.01s -> 659.81s]  oh wait, I remember I did the dollhouse.
[659.81s -> 662.41s]  There's like the dollhouse the 985 sign.
[662.41s -> 664.27s]  It's nice to come in and look.
[664.27s -> 666.47s]  Yeah, I would be all white walls.
[666.47s -> 668.47s]  No decorations.
[668.47s -> 675.20s]  The only reason I have anything on my wall is because the camera points at it.
[675.20s -> 679.63s]  It's like you want me to come in a house flipper and I'm a minimalist.
[679.63s -> 680.93s]  Hey, the invite is there.
[680.93s -> 684.23s]  If you if you want to do it, I can get you just said the invite wasn't there
[684.23s -> 684.73s]  anymore.
[684.73s -> 686.23s]  But then you told me you had like, okay.
[686.23s -> 689.91s]  Well, here's the way we got to give the context to everybody listening.
[689.91s -> 695.79s]  I reached out and hey stir good buddy know each other for like 30 years.
[695.79s -> 702.89s]  You want to do a house flipper house and your reply was stop talking to me,
[702.89s -> 705.22s]  which was which was hurtful.
[705.22s -> 707.79s]  And I figured it was I give you a few days.
[707.79s -> 710.69s]  And then when I tried again, I said, hey, just want to check it in again.
[710.69s -> 715.75s]  If you curious if you want to do that house flipper thing, you sent me a gift
[715.75s -> 721.11s]  of the current the frog drinking the tea and was like, yeah, it was like one.
[721.11s -> 722.18s]  I don't know.
[722.18s -> 724.25s]  It was kind of it was kind of hurtful.
[724.25s -> 726.05s]  Do you know my favorite gift images?
[726.05s -> 727.06s]  What is it?
[727.06s -> 729.78s]  And it relates to this.
[729.78s -> 731.95s]  He doesn't know my favorite gift.
[731.95s -> 734.75s]  You have a giga Chad is a giga Chad.
[734.75s -> 740.99s]  No, it's the orangutan trying to nail the nail into the wood, but he's not
[740.99s -> 742.62s]  actually doing it.
[742.62s -> 747.82s]  David Attenborough are doing a tumbleweed just went by.
[747.82s -> 751.08s]  We have to like press play.
[751.08s -> 751.68s]  All right.
[751.68s -> 753.68s]  I mean, you're going to like a check out.
[753.68s -> 754.58s]  I got a laugh.
[754.58s -> 754.98s]  You got it.
[754.98s -> 758.15s]  Well, we have a DM open if you want to show it to me.
[758.15s -> 760.52s]  I could find it.
[760.52s -> 760.72s]  All right.
[760.72s -> 766.27s]  It was just if I laugh then you don't have to do a house flipper house.
[766.27s -> 769.19s]  If I do laugh then you do wait.
[769.19s -> 771.20s]  They said it wrong.
[771.20s -> 775.25s]  Which one is more beneficial to you me losing or winning?
[775.25s -> 779.86s]  I didn't even hear the terms and conditions.
[779.86s -> 782.06s]  I just said it and I don't remember either.
[782.06s -> 784.77s]  Let's just play while I'm opening.
[784.77s -> 789.58s]  I just got it.
[789.58s -> 790.88s]  You're a don't laugh.
[790.88s -> 794.75s]  Okay, if I laugh at your gift, I'm I can see it.
[794.75s -> 795.45s]  It's over there right now.
[795.45s -> 796.63s]  I'm not going to look though.
[796.63s -> 799.76s]  If I laugh at this if I genuinely go, okay, that's funny.
[799.76s -> 802.92s]  Then you don't have to do a house flipper house.
[802.92s -> 813.80s]  If I do laugh if I don't laugh, you know, I'm just going to look at it.
[813.80s -> 814.10s]  All right.
[814.10s -> 814.90s]  That's funny.
[814.90s -> 817.20s]  It's the best thing on the internet.
[817.20s -> 818.00s]  It's pretty funny.
[818.00s -> 818.50s]  Yeah.
[818.50s -> 820.00s]  Yeah, that's all I love that.
[820.00s -> 821.90s]  It kind of looks like it loops and he's just trying.
[821.90s -> 823.50s]  He's been trying for a really long time.
[823.50s -> 828.83s]  My favorite part is he's got it in his mouth and he kind of like he kind of takes it out.
[828.83s -> 831.00s]  Okay, you ready?
[831.00s -> 832.66s]  I don't know.
[832.66s -> 837.82s]  You have any any more anymore zany things to talk about before we come up with it.
[837.82s -> 838.22s]  We're ready.
[838.22s -> 838.72s]  We're okay.
[838.72s -> 841.84s]  Yeah, it'll it'll it'll come up.
[841.84s -> 843.34s]  I don't know if you can see the screen.
[843.34s -> 844.54s]  I'm choosing the destination.
[844.54s -> 845.34s]  It's like a roguelike.
[845.34s -> 847.44s]  There's 12 floors to the final boss.
[847.44s -> 850.32s]  I get to do you give like a TLDR for what is going on.
[850.32s -> 852.02s]  I haven't played this game before.
[852.02s -> 856.02s]  My interpretation is that it's slay the spire with friends who play the spire.
[856.02s -> 859.46s]  You know, you battle the enemies of the gift.
[860.16s -> 863.01s]  It's quite clear.
[863.01s -> 864.51s]  Did you not show it on your stream?
[864.51s -> 866.11s]  I just looked over at your channel.
[866.11s -> 866.98s]  Let me get it.
[866.98s -> 867.28s]  Okay.
[867.28s -> 870.37s]  He doesn't care about the viewer experience.
[870.37s -> 875.89s]  I guess how do I even doubt?
[875.89s -> 880.57s]  Well, it's not I don't have this on my computer like you do.
[880.57s -> 882.27s]  You do because I sent it to you.
[882.27s -> 886.55s]  But I have to save it and like copy it and then put it over here.
[886.55s -> 891.14s]  Not I mean, no really.
[891.14s -> 895.50s]  You can drag it from discord into your OBS window.
[895.50s -> 902.14s]  I can't it doesn't let me do that.
[902.14s -> 903.74s]  Don't don't make up stuff reviews.
[903.74s -> 904.64s]  Okay.
[904.64s -> 919.30s]  Okay.
[919.30s -> 920.80s]  That's it's pretty funny.
[920.80s -> 921.50s]  It's okay.
[921.50s -> 925.70s]  You don't have to make a house if you don't want to but wait, what if I want it to then?
[925.70s -> 928.41s]  Yeah, then I'll give you a time slot.
[928.41s -> 930.22s]  Wait, there's time slots.
[930.22s -> 933.12s]  I don't think there's like 12 streamers doing this.
[933.12s -> 935.42s]  I thought they were all going to be doing it at the same time.
[935.42s -> 938.72s]  Yeah, but then after you have to give me a tour like you can't do it.
[938.72s -> 943.52s]  Everyone can't do a tour at the exact same time and you have to like schedule an open house.
[943.52s -> 948.68s]  Yes, there are 12 people doing this is the game multiplayer.
[948.68s -> 950.38s]  Like you walk you go to their house.
[950.38s -> 955.90s]  No, it's going to be discord sharing or through their stream.
[955.90s -> 958.28s]  You mean there's going to be 13 people.
[958.28s -> 959.38s]  Well, it depends.
[959.38s -> 961.88s]  There's still one or two you in the game.
[961.88s -> 962.58s]  I'm Vince.
[962.58s -> 963.58s]  I've been in the game the whole time.
[963.58s -> 965.28s]  I don't we were choosing floor one.
[965.28s -> 971.18s]  It gives you an option you encounter skeletons and a Smith or a vault where I haven't played this either.
[971.18s -> 972.18s]  I'm ready stir.
[972.18s -> 974.58s]  The only reason why people are here is to watch us argue.
[974.58s -> 975.58s]  So don't worry.
[975.58s -> 987.07s]  I know but I picked the most complicated game to argue over because you're going to have to like read cards and understand things and mechanics when we really should just be like doing a food podcast.
[987.07s -> 992.25s]  Yeah, how do I ready up?
[992.25s -> 992.85s]  I don't know.
[992.85s -> 995.07s]  I've never played this before.
[995.07s -> 997.70s]  Do I have to choose a ready button on each floor?
[997.70s -> 1000.40s]  You have a choice between two monsters guarding different locations.
[1000.40s -> 1002.84s]  Each hero makes their own choice.
[1002.84s -> 1005.79s]  Oh, oh, okay.
[1005.79s -> 1009.30s]  Zombie corpse or skeleton.
[1009.30s -> 1010.20s]  Would you do left one?
[1010.20s -> 1014.94s]  I don't I think maybe it'll even pick whatever a skeleton.
[1014.94s -> 1017.34s]  Okay, it shows what we picked above our characters.
[1017.34s -> 1018.34s]  All right, let's go.
[1018.34s -> 1019.54s]  Yeah.
[1019.54s -> 1020.04s]  Yeah.
[1020.04s -> 1020.74s]  Wow.
[1020.74s -> 1021.94s]  No cam.
[1021.94s -> 1023.58s]  If you're good, I'll turn it on.
[1023.58s -> 1025.02s]  You have a cam on right now.
[1025.02s -> 1031.23s]  I mean, I do.
[1031.23s -> 1031.83s]  All right.
[1031.83s -> 1034.09s]  So what do we do?
[1034.09s -> 1039.00s]  You attack cards drag to the enemy using your mana.
[1039.00s -> 1040.30s]  You've never played slay this fire.
[1040.30s -> 1040.60s]  I have.
[1040.60s -> 1041.78s]  Yeah.
[1041.78s -> 1043.28s]  But do we go at the same time?
[1043.28s -> 1044.48s]  Is it turns or is it?
[1044.48s -> 1049.25s]  I we're going to find out block cards.
[1049.25s -> 1050.85s]  Yeah, that just gives you the armor.
[1050.85s -> 1052.16s]  Yep.
[1052.16s -> 1054.36s]  Tell what a monster is doing by the things above their head.
[1054.36s -> 1057.94s]  Yeah, they're intent intent.
[1057.94s -> 1058.54s]  Yep.
[1058.54s -> 1062.88s]  Just like I played a little bit of Slay This Fire.
[1062.88s -> 1063.08s]  Okay.
[1063.18s -> 1066.38s]  The circle around us represents melee range and rain.
[1066.38s -> 1067.88s]  And okay, I'm done.
[1067.88s -> 1068.58s]  I can't I'm done.
[1068.58s -> 1069.28s]  Okay, that's it.
[1069.28s -> 1069.68s]  That was it.
[1069.68s -> 1070.08s]  That's it.
[1070.08s -> 1070.58s]  I read it all.
[1070.58s -> 1070.98s]  We're good.
[1071.68s -> 1073.08s]  I think we go simultaneously.
[1073.08s -> 1074.58s]  So like where are you?
[1075.25s -> 1076.45s]  I'm on the left.
[1076.45s -> 1077.85s]  Oh, we have like, okay.
[1077.85s -> 1080.15s]  We have two halves of a screen.
[1080.55s -> 1084.42s]  Yeah, and then your manas you got three mana.
[1084.42s -> 1085.83s]  I assume at the bottom.
[1085.83s -> 1086.63s]  It's a dude.
[1086.63s -> 1089.93s]  So I'm going to attack this try to attack people on your side.
[1089.93s -> 1090.93s]  Should we just go the same person?
[1091.37s -> 1093.07s]  Can you attack the zombie?
[1094.63s -> 1095.43s]  Yeah, I don't.
[1096.06s -> 1097.26s]  Okay, can you kill that guy?
[1098.54s -> 1102.94s]  And then I'm the Ranger then I have one mana to kind of cool
[1102.94s -> 1103.24s]  actually.
[1103.24s -> 1103.54s]  All right.
[1103.54s -> 1109.13s]  So I have to block now and now we in turn this is kind of cool
[1112.58s -> 1113.68s]  and then they come get us.
[1113.78s -> 1119.76s]  So when they're in the circle here that imagine that it said
[1119.76s -> 1122.16s]  when they're in the circle, they count as being in melee range.
[1122.16s -> 1123.46s]  Oh, okay.
[1124.93s -> 1129.49s]  Special heart icons to read their tooltips special features
[1132.17s -> 1134.27s]  only attacks only from near range.
[1135.90s -> 1137.80s]  I picked the game with reading man.
[1138.30s -> 1140.80s]  I can read I just did source.
[1140.80s -> 1141.80s]  When are you going to play sorcery?
[1141.80s -> 1142.50s]  You ever going to do that?
[1142.70s -> 1145.90s]  I played sorcery one on stream.
[1147.60s -> 1149.60s]  It's I'm telling you your chats going to love it.
[1150.16s -> 1153.45s]  Just going to love it if you do but every time I play a game
[1153.45s -> 1155.25s]  like that my chats like you why do you just play every game
[1155.25s -> 1158.90s]  Jerma plays stop saying that to him.
[1160.88s -> 1161.88s]  Stop saying that to him.
[1162.32s -> 1163.99s]  Stop you're hurting my feelings.
[1163.99s -> 1166.22s]  Stop saying that the great game.
[1166.52s -> 1169.42s]  They said if you play sorcery, we're done with you.
[1170.41s -> 1172.31s]  There's a better playthrough on the internet.
[1174.57s -> 1175.07s]  It's not true.
[1175.07s -> 1180.65s]  All right, so mighty blow you'll to damage in a medium radius
[1180.65s -> 1182.35s]  random monster and radius is okay.
[1182.35s -> 1184.98s]  So this will hurt to these two people.
[1187.66s -> 1190.89s]  I should probably block right with the mana because I'm going
[1190.89s -> 1191.89s]  to be the one taking all these hits.
[1192.43s -> 1194.23s]  You're taking a lot of hits you're taking out.
[1194.33s -> 1194.93s]  Oh, you're good.
[1194.93s -> 1202.11s]  You were taking a minus three fantastic for in the tutorial
[1202.11s -> 1202.61s]  level.
[1202.95s -> 1205.35s]  I think we got this why have a max amount of shield I can have
[1206.56s -> 1210.20s]  as I probably just what the hell just happened.
[1210.40s -> 1213.30s]  I just did two shield blocks and it took me down to one shield.
[1213.60s -> 1214.40s]  Oh, that's mana.
[1214.50s -> 1214.80s]  Oops.
[1216.90s -> 1219.48s]  All right, so that's one whoops.
[1226.23s -> 1227.23s]  Are you going to hit them ever?
[1227.90s -> 1231.83s]  I mean it's I could try hitting them but seems like that's
[1231.83s -> 1233.73s]  something that's on your agenda.
[1234.23s -> 1236.43s]  Well, your armor doesn't carry over to the next turn.
[1236.83s -> 1239.13s]  So you had six armor and they did like two damage to you.
[1240.40s -> 1240.80s]  That's Matt.
[1240.80s -> 1243.77s]  That's just simple math or Sarah.
[1246.87s -> 1248.87s]  Are you turned on your webcam to compete with me?
[1248.87s -> 1249.37s]  Yes.
[1250.91s -> 1251.21s]  Nice.
[1251.61s -> 1252.31s]  You what do you have?
[1252.31s -> 1253.51s]  What kind of hair do you have?
[1256.12s -> 1261.86s]  What I'm going to swing what kind of hair all right my sides
[1261.86s -> 1270.18s]  clear yours isn't my sides clear easy.
[1270.68s -> 1271.28s]  No jokes.
[1271.28s -> 1272.38s]  This is actually pretty cool.
[1272.38s -> 1273.38s]  This is like a cool concept.
[1275.33s -> 1276.03s]  No jokes.
[1276.23s -> 1277.33s]  That's why we're playing it.
[1278.32s -> 1280.12s]  Do we share this or is this for each of us?
[1280.72s -> 1281.62s]  I believe it's for each of us.
[1281.62s -> 1284.22s]  It's offering me rogue cards and you're getting warrior cards.
[1284.82s -> 1286.82s]  I thought you were going to be the wizard to be honest.
[1288.80s -> 1291.59s]  I feel like we needed a shield guy.
[1295.08s -> 1298.94s]  I took some aoe and I don't know what this gem is to what
[1298.94s -> 1301.54s]  a stamina can be added or subtracted by special card.
[1301.54s -> 1302.64s]  What does stamina do?
[1303.37s -> 1305.54s]  Is that just like the stamina?
[1308.92s -> 1309.42s]  I don't know.
[1310.35s -> 1311.55s]  I feel like this is going to be hard to use.
[1312.42s -> 1316.56s]  I'll get the short sword stamina is mana.
[1316.56s -> 1316.86s]  Okay.
[1318.71s -> 1318.91s]  Nice.
[1318.91s -> 1320.01s]  No sporadu here.
[1320.11s -> 1320.61s]  That's fine.
[1323.88s -> 1325.78s]  Why does everyone all of a sudden think you're a vampire?
[1328.79s -> 1332.63s]  Because we made like a little jokey reference.
[1332.73s -> 1336.90s]  Somebody made a picture of me with like powdered face in
[1336.90s -> 1338.30s]  like a full Dracula costume.
[1339.00s -> 1340.70s]  And then I said I would do it on Halloween.
[1341.10s -> 1346.54s]  I would do that exact outfit and you didn't do it.
[1346.94s -> 1348.04s]  Well, it's not Halloween yet.
[1348.04s -> 1349.34s]  Halloween is on October.
[1351.99s -> 1352.79s]  I guess I don't have enough money.
[1354.64s -> 1355.04s]  Vault.
[1355.71s -> 1356.31s]  Oops.
[1356.71s -> 1358.51s]  Okay, those look kind of grayed out.
[1359.37s -> 1359.77s]  Okay.
[1360.37s -> 1363.09s]  Wait, what are you picking any of these?
[1364.13s -> 1365.23s]  Yeah, so you get gems.
[1365.23s -> 1366.23s]  I got four gems.
[1366.73s -> 1370.65s]  Scoop is given you like, I don't know if we would choose.
[1370.65s -> 1372.55s]  I don't know if we have like the same choices.
[1372.95s -> 1376.02s]  Yeah, how come there's a refine?
[1376.56s -> 1377.66s]  Ooh, okay.
[1377.66s -> 1382.94s]  I'm going to write a random card shield block is going to
[1382.94s -> 1383.84s]  turn into.
[1384.58s -> 1386.82s]  Ooh, this is good for both of us.
[1387.52s -> 1388.32s]  That's good for both of us.
[1388.32s -> 1389.72s]  That gives you shield as well.
[1390.12s -> 1390.82s]  I'll be support.
[1394.80s -> 1397.87s]  Okay, get a random artifact of any rarity.
[1399.27s -> 1402.79s]  I'll try that you'll free HP after each battle.
[1402.79s -> 1403.49s]  You survive.
[1403.49s -> 1404.09s]  That's pretty good.
[1406.74s -> 1408.34s]  Maybe we shouldn't spend all of our money.
[1411.38s -> 1412.58s]  Yeah, I only spent one.
[1412.68s -> 1413.98s]  Not all of them cost money.
[1419.86s -> 1420.16s]  Cool.
[1423.58s -> 1427.19s]  Okay, and then we go down to the next floor and I get it.
[1427.19s -> 1427.59s]  That's fun.
[1427.59s -> 1429.92s]  What did you get for eight max HP?
[1429.92s -> 1430.52s]  That's pretty good.
[1432.02s -> 1433.12s]  You should think about a new haircut.
[1433.42s -> 1437.02s]  Well, I was in the middle of growing out every single like
[1437.12s -> 1437.82s]  piece of hair.
[1438.86s -> 1440.16s]  It got pretty long up here.
[1440.26s -> 1441.86s]  It was I had a really big beard.
[1444.19s -> 1445.89s]  No, it was unbearable in the heat.
[1446.36s -> 1449.96s]  It was like 115 at one point in Vegas here last week.
[1449.96s -> 1453.64s]  I want to say and I just it just like it had to go.
[1453.64s -> 1454.94s]  It was unfucking bearable.
[1458.56s -> 1459.46s]  Skeletons weren't that bad.
[1459.46s -> 1461.96s]  What is the fucking you've been in Vegas too long.
[1462.69s -> 1464.19s]  We're doing like some Elvis shit.
[1466.71s -> 1467.31s]  What is this?
[1467.41s -> 1471.71s]  What is what you seen Street?
[1471.71s -> 1472.61s]  You played Street Fighter.
[1473.22s -> 1473.82s]  Yeah, right.
[1474.12s -> 1475.12s]  What are you talking about?
[1475.32s -> 1477.22s]  You just really got inspired by Marissa.
[1477.62s -> 1479.12s]  You thought like I hairstyle looks sick.
[1479.12s -> 1479.92s]  I can pull that off.
[1480.48s -> 1481.88s]  I don't know what you're describing.
[1482.18s -> 1482.48s]  What's going?
[1482.48s -> 1483.18s]  What are you talking about?
[1484.39s -> 1485.29s]  You ready to go next floor?
[1485.49s -> 1488.93s]  I've had this hair for I I used to do e3 presentations
[1488.93s -> 1489.63s]  with this hair.
[1490.97s -> 1492.77s]  This has been a lot e3 presentation.
[1492.77s -> 1493.97s]  Yes for a long time.
[1494.41s -> 1498.81s]  Not officially not officially speaking, but you know,
[1499.11s -> 1502.70s]  I would everybody it's this is I do this all the time.
[1505.04s -> 1505.34s]  Oh, yeah.
[1505.34s -> 1508.04s]  I was presenting for my game company that I was a part of.
[1508.90s -> 1510.30s]  Oh, yeah, I remember I remember.
[1514.59s -> 1515.79s]  We keep teaching new things.
[1519.34s -> 1520.14s]  They work over time.
[1520.14s -> 1523.90s]  Okay cooperation is key.
[1523.90s -> 1529.20s]  Click on your teammates avatar to see their deck and map right.
[1529.20s -> 1531.30s]  Click on a spot on the floor to get okay.
[1531.30s -> 1533.50s]  Well, we're in a call so we can just yeah, we're not we that's
[1533.50s -> 1534.70s]  all irrelevant to me.
[1537.67s -> 1539.77s]  I think we actually have to start doing strategy though.
[1539.77s -> 1542.47s]  I think that that they that pop-up was hey, you know, you know
[1542.47s -> 1544.04s]  how to play the game now.
[1544.04s -> 1545.14s]  You need to communicate.
[1545.24s -> 1546.14s]  So how do you want to do this?
[1547.39s -> 1548.39s]  We got I don't understand.
[1548.39s -> 1550.59s]  What was the buff thing that they were talking about?
[1552.49s -> 1556.03s]  Yeah, they went away the influences.
[1557.83s -> 1560.34s]  I'm going to give us or block.
[1560.44s -> 1564.86s]  I think that's a good use of our time here and then I'm going
[1564.86s -> 1565.76s]  to deal.
[1568.48s -> 1569.68s]  This is going to be three four.
[1569.68s -> 1570.28s]  I'm good.
[1570.28s -> 1575.72s]  I can take all these hits and I'm going to do a I'm going to
[1575.72s -> 1577.72s]  hit these this guy right here.
[1578.84s -> 1580.04s]  Actually, I'm going to hit the archer.
[1580.67s -> 1585.38s]  That's weird that sometimes when I shoot enemies out of my
[1585.48s -> 1589.26s]  out of this like far away this zombie and I don't kill them.
[1589.26s -> 1591.46s]  They've returned one damage to me like it's like slay this
[1591.46s -> 1591.66s]  fire.
[1591.66s -> 1593.56s]  Like, you know, you hit the thing but it feels weird when
[1593.56s -> 1595.66s]  you're a range character and they're that far away and he's
[1595.66s -> 1598.26s]  a zombie and I can clearly see that he's a zombie.
[1600.26s -> 1602.76s]  Was it a ranged zombie like a zombie mage or something?
[1603.16s -> 1605.46s]  No, it's like when you hit something they hit you back.
[1605.56s -> 1606.86s]  Oh, it's like the boom.
[1606.86s -> 1607.66s]  You both did damage.
[1607.66s -> 1607.86s]  Okay.
[1607.86s -> 1608.26s]  I see.
[1608.36s -> 1610.16s]  Yeah, the hearthstone cards bumping.
[1610.16s -> 1610.46s]  Yep.
[1613.98s -> 1614.38s]  Okay.
[1615.12s -> 1616.22s]  Rose a bone in me.
[1616.32s -> 1617.62s]  This monster is buffed.
[1617.92s -> 1619.02s]  He's got five damage.
[1619.42s -> 1620.32s]  This is going to hurt a lot.
[1620.62s -> 1621.92s]  I'm about to take 10 damage.
[1621.92s -> 1623.42s]  If you die, I can kill me.
[1623.82s -> 1625.02s]  I'm shooting him.
[1626.61s -> 1629.47s]  God you're about to take five still.
[1630.26s -> 1631.66s]  Well, not necessarily true.
[1632.36s -> 1632.86s]  Wait, wait.
[1633.16s -> 1633.56s]  Oops.
[1636.43s -> 1637.43s]  Can you block me?
[1638.26s -> 1639.06s]  It doesn't matter.
[1639.06s -> 1639.96s]  I can block you.
[1639.96s -> 1642.79s]  Yes, and then I can kill this guy.
[1644.25s -> 1645.45s]  I'm still going to take one damage though.
[1648.30s -> 1652.42s]  Oh, cuz those long-range guys are shooting you know, what
[1652.42s -> 1653.22s]  is shake down?
[1654.42s -> 1655.42s]  You'll did you just do that?
[1656.09s -> 1656.49s]  Yes.
[1656.49s -> 1658.09s]  Oh, that's what you are playing.
[1658.09s -> 1659.49s]  I get it my gems.
[1665.20s -> 1666.90s]  Yeah, better be better be grateful.
[1668.63s -> 1671.46s]  Wait, how do I I can't use my blocks on you.
[1671.46s -> 1672.66s]  That's that's a you thing.
[1673.16s -> 1673.86s]  You can't do it to me.
[1679.39s -> 1680.29s]  I'm getting kind of hurt here.
[1680.59s -> 1684.51s]  All right, you you're okay.
[1686.33s -> 1687.83s]  Yeah, why do they all want to kill you?
[1688.33s -> 1689.53s]  I think I'm the tank, right?
[1691.36s -> 1693.06s]  I'm going to give us this yourself like a tank.
[1693.50s -> 1694.10s]  Let's do that.
[1696.14s -> 1699.04s]  I mean I could I do I I deal more damage to things when
[1699.04s -> 1700.24s]  they're outside the circles.
[1700.34s -> 1703.11s]  So when they're all coming in this circle, I start to
[1703.11s -> 1704.21s]  become pretty useless.
[1705.26s -> 1706.66s]  So I can kill the range guy.
[1706.96s -> 1712.95s]  I guess I can kill the guy right next to me and then
[1713.05s -> 1713.85s]  you're kind of on your own.
[1713.85s -> 1714.35s]  Yeah, we're good.
[1714.55s -> 1715.25s]  We're good.
[1715.92s -> 1716.72s]  And take any damage.
[1719.91s -> 1721.51s]  I had your stream muted for like two minutes and I
[1721.51s -> 1722.61s]  didn't even realize it.
[1725.13s -> 1726.43s]  You probably busy with something.
[1726.94s -> 1728.14s]  You probably had something else going on.
[1732.87s -> 1738.28s]  I can kill this guy and then I'm going to give you
[1738.28s -> 1742.19s]  some block and then I'm going to swing my sword at
[1742.29s -> 1744.31s]  this one.
[1744.41s -> 1745.61s]  Okay, I didn't spend the gems.
[1745.71s -> 1748.45s]  It just isn't showing the gems on the UI yet or
[1748.45s -> 1750.84s]  while we're in combat.
[1751.04s -> 1752.44s]  You asked her if he had a good breakfast.
[1752.44s -> 1753.44s]  Did you have a good breakfast?
[1756.26s -> 1761.95s]  Did I did I would you have let's compare breakfasts
[1762.05s -> 1768.03s]  as that's on I think today I had a what did I have
[1769.08s -> 1772.78s]  I had a I just had a sandwich just like a two slices
[1772.78s -> 1773.18s]  of bread.
[1773.18s -> 1774.78s]  You put meat and cheese in between it tight.
[1774.78s -> 1775.48s]  What was this?
[1775.58s -> 1776.18s]  What was the meat?
[1777.88s -> 1781.66s]  Ham salami Muenster cheese sandwich.
[1783.92s -> 1788.18s]  Okay, that's like I would eat that.
[1789.63s -> 1792.76s]  Okay, but you're you're about to like embarrass me
[1792.76s -> 1793.76s]  with this incredible.
[1794.16s -> 1796.74s]  No breakfast you had I had.
[1798.94s -> 1800.94s]  I drank full serving of kefir.
[1801.34s -> 1804.82s]  It's just like a yogurt drink and then I had some
[1804.82s -> 1809.90s]  greens what I don't know when I say it like that.
[1809.90s -> 1812.10s]  It sounds like I am kind of trying to be better
[1812.10s -> 1812.50s]  than you.
[1813.85s -> 1816.35s]  There's the inflection of the green and some greens
[1816.45s -> 1818.25s]  because like you didn't say you had green so I was
[1818.25s -> 1819.95s]  like trying to make it seem like I was like way
[1819.95s -> 1821.05s]  better than you at breakfast.
[1821.05s -> 1823.75s]  Hey, I didn't I did not have a balanced breakfast.
[1824.05s -> 1826.15s]  I normally wouldn't have that for breakfast and
[1826.15s -> 1827.55s]  I'm kind of embarrassed and you're putting me on
[1827.55s -> 1828.05s]  the spot.
[1833.13s -> 1834.03s]  What a health nut.
[1838.03s -> 1838.83s]  I'm really not.
[1842.03s -> 1843.23s]  Oh, is it just gambling?
[1844.06s -> 1846.56s]  You have a 50% chance to find three gems.
[1847.78s -> 1848.58s]  Well, I lost.
[1852.25s -> 1852.85s]  I got him.
[1854.80s -> 1857.10s]  I'm doing the I'm doing the gem build.
[1857.30s -> 1859.20s]  There's a lot of rogue gem cards.
[1860.70s -> 1866.28s]  Okay, I can exchange this you'll damage equal to
[1866.28s -> 1867.08s]  your block.
[1867.48s -> 1867.88s]  Hmm.
[1867.88s -> 1870.94s]  I don't like that in a boomerang shield.
[1875.19s -> 1879.86s]  I mean why not free free and then I'll do this
[1880.36s -> 1881.16s]  and I lost again.
[1884.10s -> 1885.10s]  You're poor.
[1885.50s -> 1894.08s]  That was like 50 52 50 50s losing them both you
[1894.08s -> 1895.78s]  will encounter Templar.
[1897.38s -> 1898.98s]  So this is we can upgrade our cards.
[1901.05s -> 1903.15s]  All right, so they these these mean very important
[1903.15s -> 1903.25s]  thing.
[1903.25s -> 1907.50s]  Yeah, the type of enemy you fight and the reward
[1908.13s -> 1908.73s]  you want.
[1909.13s -> 1909.93s]  What do you have on you?
[1909.93s -> 1912.33s]  We choose our own and then the end where it shows
[1912.33s -> 1914.53s]  like the three options I think are based on
[1914.53s -> 1915.23s]  what we chose.
[1915.53s -> 1915.73s]  Okay.
[1915.73s -> 1918.37s]  Well, I made it hard because I Templar is going
[1918.37s -> 1919.69s]  to fight us.
[1919.79s -> 1920.09s]  Okay.
[1920.09s -> 1923.49s]  Well, how do you know what Templar is hard Templars
[1923.49s -> 1925.29s]  are usually weak because when they go to swing
[1925.29s -> 1927.69s]  at you they go wait would God want this and they
[1927.69s -> 1932.93s]  hesitate that looks like a hard enemy as 15 health
[1933.61s -> 1935.41s]  I got an I got a card.
[1935.51s -> 1937.01s]  I got a trump card for that guy.
[1940.04s -> 1941.94s]  So right now I'm going to shield block you out.
[1943.41s -> 1944.71s]  Let me shield block you first if you're going to
[1944.71s -> 1946.51s]  take damage because you'll get it did literally.
[1946.51s -> 1948.11s]  I don't know why I did literally nothing.
[1951.31s -> 1954.90s]  I'm going to do mighty blow.
[1959.50s -> 1961.20s]  What is this new thing here?
[1963.21s -> 1966.60s]  What is that above the imp block against three
[1966.60s -> 1973.72s]  block from a fix your sideburns there?
[1973.72s -> 1974.82s]  They probably all messed up right now.
[1974.82s -> 1975.22s]  It's fine though.
[1975.22s -> 1984.93s]  I don't care to ignite bombs.
[1986.94s -> 1987.14s]  All right.
[1987.14s -> 1989.18s]  Well, I'm in a little bit of trouble here.
[1993.56s -> 1997.94s]  Oh, you see, okay.
[1997.94s -> 1998.94s]  I put a bomb out there.
[1998.94s -> 2001.41s]  You see the bomb on the right this thing here.
[2002.37s -> 2005.47s]  Yeah, and I have to ignite it and the other Templar
[2006.39s -> 2012.31s]  I bombed him you're in danger there pal the first
[2012.31s -> 2014.21s]  monster I could kill the one here.
[2014.21s -> 2014.81s]  I could do okay.
[2014.81s -> 2017.01s]  I could do for damage to the Templar.
[2018.42s -> 2018.92s]  I got it.
[2019.32s -> 2020.22s]  I'll just okay.
[2020.22s -> 2023.19s]  I can't kill this imp but I could kill the yeah,
[2023.19s -> 2026.19s]  I'm going to kill this guy and then I will just
[2026.19s -> 2034.57s]  do a oh with it not in the circle thought he's
[2034.57s -> 2035.07s]  in the circle.
[2036.70s -> 2038.80s]  I think when they're on the line that's considered
[2038.80s -> 2046.77s]  mid-range or can you remove this charm that you
[2046.77s -> 2049.31s]  put on me just go eat a banana.
[2049.31s -> 2052.26s]  You'll be all right that does fix it.
[2052.26s -> 2060.88s]  Usually I'm going to I was going to attack this
[2061.08s -> 2061.88s]  person right next to you.
[2063.58s -> 2064.08s]  Thank you.
[2067.40s -> 2068.00s]  What did you do?
[2068.79s -> 2069.69s]  I kicked him away.
[2071.38s -> 2073.58s]  We don't got to kill him this turn or you had
[2073.58s -> 2076.28s]  lethal you had to make them did I did I actually
[2076.28s -> 2079.78s]  have lethal I can't see your cards.
[2082.78s -> 2084.08s]  Why do you have two webcams?
[2089.35s -> 2091.95s]  Do you you should get like five of all different
[2091.95s -> 2092.75s]  angles of your head.
[2093.15s -> 2094.45s]  Did I tell you about the stream that I really
[2094.45s -> 2098.36s]  wanted to do and it was I wanted to get like 30
[2098.36s -> 2102.19s]  webcams and have them all set for different
[2102.19s -> 2103.59s]  timings and stuff and have them delayed at
[2103.59s -> 2105.39s]  different times so I could like yell at myself
[2105.39s -> 2106.59s]  and fight myself and stuff.
[2109.52s -> 2110.92s]  Okay, you go Andy.
[2111.71s -> 2116.58s]  Well, I I talked to I talked to Jake about it
[2116.58s -> 2121.30s]  community Jake and he was just like I don't
[2121.30s -> 2123.30s]  think what you want to do is physically fucking
[2123.30s -> 2124.00s]  possible.
[2124.90s -> 2127.60s]  I was like, okay, I was like, all right yourself
[2127.60s -> 2128.50s]  on a camera.
[2128.50s -> 2131.34s]  I was like, whatever if it's not going to work.
[2131.34s -> 2132.14s]  It's not going to work.
[2135.53s -> 2144.71s]  Here there's also it was it was this was like
[2144.71s -> 2148.21s]  kind of COVID was still kind of COVID was like
[2148.31s -> 2150.51s]  people were locked down was happening and I
[2150.51s -> 2152.51s]  didn't want to because like webcams people doing
[2152.51s -> 2154.21s]  a bunch of zoom calls and be needing to buy
[2154.21s -> 2157.02s]  webcams and I didn't want to be the guy that
[2157.02s -> 2159.42s]  like wiped out the fucking webcam supply during
[2159.42s -> 2161.32s]  COVID by buying like 40 of them.
[2162.14s -> 2164.54s]  It was like, I don't think I want to do that.
[2164.54s -> 2166.64s]  I think that's probably like not a good idea.
[2168.72s -> 2169.62s]  Oh, we won.
[2169.62s -> 2171.22s]  I could understand that argument if you went to
[2171.22s -> 2173.59s]  the grocery store and like bought all of the
[2173.59s -> 2176.46s]  food, but these you're talking about webcams.
[2177.26s -> 2179.36s]  Yeah, but there was I feel like there was like a
[2179.36s -> 2181.56s]  weird price surge with webcams and it was like,
[2181.56s -> 2183.46s]  oh, they're like very expensive now because
[2183.46s -> 2184.76s]  people are buying them to a ton of people are
[2184.76s -> 2185.92s]  buying them.
[2186.12s -> 2188.12s]  I was like, I don't I want to be the guy that
[2188.12s -> 2189.72s]  has I don't know.
[2189.82s -> 2191.62s]  I don't know if I want to do it.
[2192.80s -> 2196.84s]  I got like test ones at one point at some point
[2196.84s -> 2197.24s]  later.
[2197.24s -> 2200.34s]  I got I want to say like six and I tried to
[2200.34s -> 2202.81s]  hook them all up and it was like this is fucking
[2202.81s -> 2204.81s]  impossible and it just made me frustrated and
[2204.81s -> 2217.68s]  I just can the whole thing just delay the single
[2217.68s -> 2218.88s]  webcam 30 times.
[2219.88s -> 2222.98s]  There is some weird reason why I couldn't do that.
[2223.80s -> 2228.41s]  I forget what it was, but I thought of that you
[2228.41s -> 2229.71s]  can barely use one webcam.
[2229.71s -> 2230.01s]  Yeah.
[2230.41s -> 2232.31s]  Yeah, it was a USB thing, right?
[2232.31s -> 2235.21s]  Yeah, it was like the amount of USB bus slots
[2235.31s -> 2237.31s]  that are on a motherboard like it couldn't do
[2237.31s -> 2237.91s]  it or something.
[2237.91s -> 2241.88s]  You can you can get a like a USB extension.
[2242.08s -> 2244.58s]  Yeah, but I think it's still uses the same bus
[2244.58s -> 2244.98s]  lane.
[2245.28s -> 2246.18s]  I really think so.
[2246.18s -> 2247.98s]  I looked into this and I was like, well fuck.
[2247.98s -> 2248.58s]  I can't do this.
[2248.58s -> 2252.49s]  I have a I forget what you call him like a graphics
[2252.49s -> 2252.69s]  card.
[2252.69s -> 2255.39s]  You plug it into that slot and it has USBs on it.
[2255.39s -> 2259.66s]  I have one of those like why couldn't you do that?
[2260.33s -> 2260.73s]  I wouldn't.
[2261.53s -> 2263.43s]  It was something it was something and I think the
[2263.43s -> 2265.23s]  only way I would have needed to have like four
[2265.23s -> 2269.42s]  motherboards and it's just like this is this this
[2269.42s -> 2271.92s]  is turning into like a like a science YouTube video
[2271.92s -> 2276.12s]  that I'm not making and I'm not I don't think so.
[2276.12s -> 2278.56s]  So you so you gave up I did.
[2278.56s -> 2281.16s]  Yeah, some ideas you just kind of move on.
[2281.92s -> 2282.32s]  Okay.
[2283.02s -> 2283.62s]  Yeah, that's true.
[2285.12s -> 2285.32s]  All right.
[2285.32s -> 2293.55s]  I'm going to refine this one's good.
[2293.55s -> 2294.05s]  Hey maker.
[2301.38s -> 2301.58s]  All right.
[2301.58s -> 2303.94s]  Hey maker or maim.
[2305.83s -> 2307.13s]  Oh, I love my names.
[2309.78s -> 2321.34s]  I'm doing a maker and then I'm going to do so I
[2321.34s -> 2322.34s]  get both of these.
[2329.18s -> 2329.78s]  Oh, I like that.
[2329.78s -> 2332.48s]  Wait, what a strain do is that like you can't lose
[2332.48s -> 2332.98s]  you lose.
[2333.18s -> 2334.28s]  Why you spend your money?
[2335.46s -> 2338.56s]  No, my build gained strength from how many gems
[2338.56s -> 2339.06s]  I have.
[2341.27s -> 2343.27s]  I are in my build German.
[2345.12s -> 2348.02s]  Do you want removal on the next rest period?
[2348.02s -> 2354.58s]  Do you want new cards new cards?
[2354.68s -> 2355.78s]  I want to see the new cards.
[2355.88s -> 2358.60s]  Okay, I want to see what's out there in the big wide
[2358.60s -> 2361.57s]  world just by 40 PCs.
[2364.80s -> 2365.60s]  I agree with that.
[2367.70s -> 2372.09s]  I know this one looks hard.
[2374.44s -> 2375.84s]  Yeah, you ever seen a snail dude.
[2375.84s -> 2376.24s]  Yeah.
[2380.17s -> 2382.27s]  So when these firearms fly into the near range,
[2382.27s -> 2383.57s]  they explode when they die.
[2385.24s -> 2386.44s]  So you got to watch out for that.
[2386.64s -> 2387.74s]  I heard us with it last round.
[2387.74s -> 2393.91s]  I didn't know I'm going to give this to you and
[2393.91s -> 2402.27s]  then I'm going to slash this one.
[2402.87s -> 2404.07s]  I'm going to slash this morning.
[2404.57s -> 2406.27s]  Yeah, wait, should we kill this thing?
[2406.27s -> 2409.64s]  It's in here at the top this thing right here.
[2410.82s -> 2414.74s]  Do you have one damage not in close range?
[2414.74s -> 2416.14s]  No, oops.
[2417.71s -> 2422.88s]  Well, I killed it didn't have to hello.
[2423.98s -> 2424.48s]  It was weird.
[2429.19s -> 2431.29s]  You look like Anakin from episode 3.
[2434.46s -> 2436.56s]  That sounds like a compliment Anakin is one of
[2436.56s -> 2438.96s]  the most powerful Jedi's to have ever existed.
[2443.04s -> 2443.44s]  Cool.
[2446.45s -> 2448.35s]  How come every time I take that test I get Yoda
[2450.82s -> 2452.72s]  which is also amazing by the way.
[2456.76s -> 2457.76s]  Yoda's pretty sick.
[2459.24s -> 2462.74s]  All right, you're just kind of cute five damage.
[2463.78s -> 2465.18s]  Does anybody have block on right now?
[2466.85s -> 2468.55s]  No, I can't really do anything this round.
[2469.15s -> 2470.65s]  You want me to just do here.
[2479.01s -> 2479.91s]  It's hard out here.
[2482.76s -> 2483.96s]  Can I hit everybody with this?
[2484.90s -> 2486.60s]  I thought it would could only hit two people.
[2486.70s -> 2487.50s]  That's amazing.
[2487.50s -> 2487.80s]  Okay.
[2487.80s -> 2489.30s]  Well, I almost just cleared my whole side.
[2494.30s -> 2495.70s]  You have a favorite Star Wars character.
[2499.57s -> 2501.07s]  I don't know the big one.
[2502.40s -> 2502.90s]  Jabba.
[2504.06s -> 2505.86s]  Yeah, how about the Hutt is your favorite Star Wars
[2505.86s -> 2506.46s]  character.
[2507.57s -> 2509.37s]  I'm not I don't know too much about Star Wars,
[2509.37s -> 2510.27s]  but I know he's cool.
[2511.40s -> 2512.20s]  Mine's Luke.
[2516.42s -> 2516.92s]  Lame.
[2517.62s -> 2519.62s]  If your answer of your favorite Star Wars
[2519.62s -> 2521.72s]  character is like the protagonist.
[2522.98s -> 2523.58s]  Lame.
[2524.98s -> 2526.48s]  Luke is actually really cool though.
[2527.98s -> 2529.68s]  It's not Luke, but I would say Luke is cool.
[2533.91s -> 2534.71s]  That's a bad take.
[2534.81s -> 2536.51s]  Yeah, that's a pretty shit take stir.
[2541.81s -> 2545.41s]  Why because okay, what if the main character
[2545.41s -> 2548.61s]  of a show is really really awesome like really
[2548.61s -> 2551.01s]  cool and like wow, what a great character.
[2552.79s -> 2553.59s]  Let me ask you this.
[2553.89s -> 2555.29s]  Have you played Red Dead Redemption 2?
[2556.70s -> 2559.96s]  No, what?
[2561.60s -> 2561.90s]  Okay.
[2561.90s -> 2564.40s]  I played half of the tutorial and I was like,
[2564.40s -> 2565.80s]  I don't think I really want to do this.
[2565.80s -> 2569.20s]  What no way you've never really good.
[2570.96s -> 2571.26s]  Wow.
[2571.26s -> 2571.76s]  Okay.
[2572.06s -> 2575.70s]  But did you play GTA 5 all the way through you did
[2575.70s -> 2577.90s]  didn't know I got to that mission where you had
[2577.90s -> 2582.20s]  to start like loading cargo at the shipyard
[2582.78s -> 2585.18s]  and I was like, this isn't what I signed up for.
[2586.66s -> 2588.16s]  I kind of lost interest in the story.
[2588.16s -> 2590.86s]  Oh, I just exploded that you got any armor for me?
[2591.40s -> 2592.10s]  I did.
[2592.80s -> 2593.70s]  I got rid of it.
[2597.26s -> 2599.26s]  But anyways, my point was going to be that Arthur
[2599.26s -> 2602.86s]  Morgan is the main character and I think Arthur
[2602.86s -> 2604.16s]  Morgan is probably one of the coolest characters
[2604.16s -> 2604.96s]  in that whole game.
[2605.06s -> 2607.16s]  Like is that is that wrong?
[2607.36s -> 2608.66s]  Which one's Arthur Morgan?
[2609.98s -> 2610.48s]  Dutch.
[2612.07s -> 2612.97s]  I can't do it.
[2613.17s -> 2614.67s]  Oh and Red Dead Redemption.
[2614.67s -> 2614.97s]  Yeah.
[2616.60s -> 2617.40s]  What are you talking about?
[2617.40s -> 2622.42s]  That was not a great impression, but yeah,
[2622.42s -> 2624.02s]  but we're talking about Star Wars.
[2624.42s -> 2627.02s]  Yeah, but I'm saying but you said the main character
[2627.32s -> 2629.02s]  thinking the main character is the best character
[2629.02s -> 2632.26s]  in the series is lame is what you said.
[2632.76s -> 2634.56s]  Arthur Morgan is not lame and I think he's the
[2634.56s -> 2635.36s]  best character in that game.
[2635.36s -> 2636.86s]  No, no, no, no.
[2636.96s -> 2638.76s]  I'm talking about Star Wars.
[2639.06s -> 2640.76s]  Okay, I'm talking about in general.
[2640.86s -> 2643.06s]  Oh, characters are bad.
[2643.06s -> 2645.46s]  Okay, everybody settle down reason, but like when
[2645.46s -> 2647.66s]  you're talking about Disney Star Wars, like I want
[2647.66s -> 2648.96s]  to be the protag Luke.
[2648.96s -> 2649.66s]  He's so strong.
[2649.86s -> 2651.36s]  They have like no personality.
[2653.54s -> 2655.24s]  You really want to you your main your favorite
[2655.24s -> 2657.44s]  character is Luke when there's characters like
[2657.44s -> 2661.59s]  Jabba the Hutt all the side characters in Star
[2661.59s -> 2664.09s]  Wars are cooler than the main protags because
[2664.09s -> 2664.99s]  they're not human.
[2665.39s -> 2669.79s]  It's always the default anime protag human male
[2669.79s -> 2671.49s]  white male hit with the hair.
[2673.82s -> 2676.32s]  I did not I did not know you with this strongly
[2676.42s -> 2680.22s]  for I thought you meant all I thought you meant
[2680.32s -> 2682.82s]  all fucking like media.
[2684.62s -> 2687.62s]  Dude any show I've ever seen the main character
[2688.16s -> 2689.06s]  so boring.
[2689.26s -> 2691.06s]  That's what I thought you like our main character.
[2691.06s -> 2691.66s]  I don't like that.
[2691.66s -> 2694.06s]  I like the weird side character that was in two
[2694.06s -> 2696.69s]  episodes, which is they're still cold.
[2696.79s -> 2698.59s]  I have a lot of favorites that are like that.
[2703.67s -> 2706.17s]  They're the they're the blank slate that you put
[2706.57s -> 2710.21s]  inject yourself into and you you love that guy.
[2710.21s -> 2711.31s]  Don't you know?
[2711.31s -> 2712.41s]  Well, hold on this thing.
[2712.41s -> 2713.81s]  I think silent protagonist.
[2713.81s -> 2718.84s]  Yes, I think a silent protagonist you're imprinting
[2718.84s -> 2720.14s]  yourself on a silent protagonist.
[2721.12s -> 2723.42s]  I think that it has a kiss his sister.
[2726.27s -> 2727.87s]  I don't maybe I don't know.
[2728.56s -> 2731.20s]  Yeah, no points for that.
[2731.40s -> 2733.60s]  I was ironically saying Luke.
[2733.70s -> 2737.20s]  I don't think Luke is the coolest character in the franchise.
[2737.20s -> 2738.10s]  It's ironic.
[2738.10s -> 2738.90s]  I was pulling back.
[2738.90s -> 2740.00s]  I was just being ironic.
[2740.89s -> 2743.39s]  So is your general Grievous is my favorite character
[2743.39s -> 2744.49s]  in all of Star Wars.
[2744.49s -> 2748.40s]  Okay, if you want me to give it to you, I do.
[2754.80s -> 2755.90s]  Did you pick a card yet?
[2756.30s -> 2757.40s]  I'm confused.
[2757.84s -> 2758.24s]  Sure.
[2758.24s -> 2762.50s]  I picked a card general general Grievous.
[2762.50s -> 2762.90s]  There it is.
[2762.90s -> 2765.60s]  I think I've told this story to you and multiple times
[2765.60s -> 2767.70s]  before that when I was a child in the first grade
[2767.70s -> 2768.70s]  Star Wars was really cool.
[2768.70s -> 2770.80s]  I'd never seen any of them, but I knew it was cool.
[2771.00s -> 2773.20s]  And when I was out shopping with my mom, I saw
[2773.80s -> 2776.10s]  a t-shirt with one of the droids on it because that movie
[2776.10s -> 2778.40s]  had just come out and I was like I want that so I can fit in
[2778.50s -> 2782.40s]  and that's all I know about the Clone Ward bought movies.
[2782.50s -> 2784.69s]  Okay, that's kind of cool though.
[2784.89s -> 2786.59s]  I don't know anything about general Grievous.
[2786.59s -> 2789.29s]  I just know that he's got four lightsabers and he still
[2789.29s -> 2790.79s]  can't beat a guy with one.
[2793.70s -> 2799.10s]  I'm about to get really heated at that point in episode 3
[2799.50s -> 2801.40s]  general Grievous was already very injured.
[2801.50s -> 2805.30s]  Not only that he was injured previously before the events
[2805.30s -> 2808.00s]  that happened in the prequels very seriously injured.
[2809.71s -> 2810.41s]  Okay, hold on.
[2813.10s -> 2813.80s]  I got to settle down.
[2815.50s -> 2816.60s]  He literally wasn't.
[2820.16s -> 2821.06s]  I don't know the lore.
[2821.06s -> 2823.66s]  I wish I could debate you more, but I actually haven't seen
[2823.66s -> 2823.86s]  it.
[2823.96s -> 2824.76s]  You just don't know the lore.
[2824.76s -> 2825.26s]  That's okay.
[2831.79s -> 2833.49s]  Oh, you're great out.
[2837.16s -> 2838.56s]  You're a Star Wars nerd.
[2839.62s -> 2840.52s]  I'm not really.
[2840.92s -> 2842.42s]  I haven't seen any of the newer things.
[2845.96s -> 2846.56s]  Why not?
[2847.10s -> 2848.90s]  I don't know because it's just too much of it.
[2851.62s -> 2853.52s]  It's like I it's there's just too much.
[2853.62s -> 2854.32s]  It's too much.
[2854.42s -> 2856.96s]  I don't I don't I don't want I don't there's too many
[2856.96s -> 2857.86s]  things to watch.
[2857.86s -> 2861.45s]  It's just like I it's like, oh the Mandalorian Mandalorian
[2861.45s -> 2863.75s]  and then we got like all these other like Obi-Wan stuff.
[2863.75s -> 2865.55s]  And then there's they're making like another movie.
[2865.55s -> 2868.36s]  They're making like another TV show and then it's kind of
[2868.36s -> 2869.36s]  like the Marvel stuff for me.
[2869.46s -> 2870.86s]  It's like my this is too much of it.
[2870.96s -> 2873.58s]  It's just I don't even it's like I don't yeah.
[2873.58s -> 2874.68s]  Yeah, I you know, I agree.
[2874.68s -> 2876.98s]  I would much prefer if they made a Dune movie and it was
[2876.98s -> 2881.70s]  like one third of the first book and nothing really happens.
[2881.80s -> 2884.60s]  I made this joke like a year or two ago, but I was going
[2884.60s -> 2886.90s]  to say like I can't like let me just say it out loud
[2886.90s -> 2888.40s]  because it's very good.
[2888.40s -> 2891.19s]  I think I made a tweet that I didn't tweet it saved in
[2891.19s -> 2891.69s]  drafts.
[2891.99s -> 2895.33s]  So, you know, like that as you will it said I can't wait
[2895.33s -> 2899.23s]  for phase six of the Marvel Cinematic Universe when it's
[2899.23s -> 2902.43s]  a baking competition between Wolverine Cyclops and
[2902.43s -> 2905.47s]  Professor X like reality show.
[2910.71s -> 2911.41s]  That's pretty damn weird.
[2911.41s -> 2914.61s]  Wait, where did I missed a few sentences there?
[2914.71s -> 2918.62s]  How did we jump from the what I don't think you were
[2918.62s -> 2920.12s]  paying attention to what I was saying, but it's okay.
[2920.59s -> 2920.79s]  Okay.
[2920.79s -> 2921.39s]  No, I wasn't.
[2921.39s -> 2925.88s]  I was thinking about doing wait.
[2925.88s -> 2926.98s]  There's a TV series.
[2928.23s -> 2929.73s]  You ready there were what a boss fight.
[2929.83s -> 2934.48s]  I think we're fighting the Whopper from the Big Mac.
[2934.48s -> 2935.58s]  We're fighting the Whopper.
[2936.08s -> 2939.58s]  Yeah, I don't think we're there yet.
[2939.58s -> 2940.58s]  We have another floor.
[2941.15s -> 2941.35s]  All right.
[2941.35s -> 2942.35s]  How about the wild hog?
[2942.35s -> 2942.95s]  That sounds good.
[2945.12s -> 2952.30s]  We're gonna eat a VLT kill curse ghost.
[2957.03s -> 2957.73s]  That's a lot.
[2959.23s -> 2960.23s]  That is a lot boys.
[2960.53s -> 2966.22s]  What do these do attacks only from near range heels itself
[2966.22s -> 2970.16s]  at the beginning of monsters turn and it's rotten.
[2970.26s -> 2971.76s]  So you have to kill these things that they hurt you.
[2971.96s -> 2974.83s]  Okay, the big skeleton the Whopper is the Whopper.
[2974.83s -> 2977.43s]  All right spawns a skeleton every time it receives damage.
[2978.42s -> 2979.62s]  So don't just go tickling him.
[2979.92s -> 2981.32s]  Oh, I thought a lot of skeletons.
[2981.32s -> 2983.12s]  I thought you were just saying the Whopper.
[2983.12s -> 2986.32s]  This is the actual name of the Whopper.
[2988.98s -> 2990.68s]  Oh, I went to McDonald's.
[2990.78s -> 2991.58s]  I went to McDonald's.
[2991.58s -> 2992.28s]  This is important.
[2992.88s -> 2996.28s]  I went to McDonald's and I was so confident like, oh yeah,
[2996.68s -> 3000.98s]  McDonald's and I turned to the I turned to the the speaker
[3000.98s -> 3002.78s]  and I'm like, hey, how are you?
[3002.78s -> 3003.58s]  How are you doing today?
[3003.58s -> 3004.38s]  Having a good day?
[3004.78s -> 3006.98s]  I'll take one Grimace meal, please.
[3008.49s -> 3010.56s]  I was like, dude, that's over.
[3010.76s -> 3012.06s]  It's not happening anymore.
[3012.66s -> 3016.16s]  And I was like, and I said, oh fuck, I missed Grimace's birthday
[3016.16s -> 3017.16s]  and I think he heard me.
[3021.00s -> 3022.80s]  I didn't drink the fucking shake.
[3023.75s -> 3024.95s]  I don't even know what it tastes like.
[3024.95s -> 3026.75s]  I've tried to get it, but I was too late.
[3027.19s -> 3029.29s]  I said, oh fuck, I miss Grimace's birthday.
[3031.30s -> 3031.50s]  All right.
[3031.50s -> 3033.60s]  We're killing the Whopper.
[3034.70s -> 3035.70s]  I stun the Whopper.
[3037.23s -> 3038.33s]  So what do you want me to do?
[3041.62s -> 3042.52s]  I'm going to kill this character.
[3047.10s -> 3048.00s]  I mean, I did a lot.
[3049.91s -> 3050.51s]  I'm done.
[3051.37s -> 3053.77s]  I just took out three flying hogs and end turn.
[3056.55s -> 3057.55s]  I had a funny idea too.
[3057.55s -> 3059.25s]  You know, over and like drinks the Grimace shake and like, oh
[3059.25s -> 3061.65s]  my god, I'm I like died because I drank the shake or whatever
[3061.65s -> 3062.95s]  that like the trend is.
[3064.44s -> 3067.54s]  Yeah, I was going to take a sip out of the Grimace shake on
[3067.54s -> 3068.04s]  camera.
[3068.51s -> 3069.21s]  No way.
[3069.21s -> 3069.61s]  Yeah.
[3069.61s -> 3071.21s]  And then that's crazy.
[3071.41s -> 3072.01s]  Stop it.
[3072.41s -> 3074.51s]  And then after I took a sip out of it, it was going to cut to
[3074.51s -> 3077.52s]  me like lifting weights really well.
[3078.16s -> 3080.86s]  It was going to cut to me like relaxing on a couch.
[3081.26s -> 3083.66s]  It was going to cut to like I was going to do a lot of great
[3083.66s -> 3084.66s]  things were going to happen to me.
[3085.71s -> 3087.71s]  I was going to be like, wow, everything's like wonderful today.
[3087.71s -> 3088.51s]  I feel like great.
[3088.91s -> 3090.21s]  Everything feels amazing.
[3091.81s -> 3093.21s]  But I was like, oh, that's meh.
[3093.61s -> 3094.61s]  I thought it was all right for a second.
[3095.43s -> 3098.53s]  I mean, I would like that if also amongst those things.
[3098.53s -> 3100.93s]  It was like you making out with someone in a Grimace costume.
[3107.07s -> 3108.07s]  Lifted weights.
[3108.57s -> 3110.17s]  Everything's going so well.
[3110.65s -> 3111.05s]  Yeah.
[3111.45s -> 3113.25s]  Oh, that's like, I don't know what's wrong with everyone
[3113.25s -> 3113.45s]  else.
[3113.45s -> 3114.45s]  Like Grimace gets me.
[3120.28s -> 3121.98s]  Grimace gets me.
[3122.56s -> 3123.96s]  Oh, that's funny.
[3127.82s -> 3130.12s]  I was going to get like eight full hours of sleep.
[3132.11s -> 3135.21s]  But like during that trend, how expensive a Grimace costume
[3135.21s -> 3135.71s]  must be.
[3136.11s -> 3138.21s]  Yeah, you want to talk about buying the webcams during
[3138.21s -> 3140.31s]  when like the all five by 40 webcams.
[3140.51s -> 3142.81s]  How expensive was a fucking Grimace costume?
[3143.61s -> 3144.61s]  They got wiped out.
[3145.01s -> 3146.61s]  They were off of every shelf.
[3146.61s -> 3149.41s]  Well, no, I haven't seen a Grimace costume in any of those.
[3149.41s -> 3151.71s]  Maybe it wasn't effective, but you have to you know, and
[3151.71s -> 3152.71s]  it's got to get delivered.
[3152.71s -> 3154.11s]  Then Grimace's birthday is over.
[3154.11s -> 3156.11s]  How long can you guys birthday last?
[3156.51s -> 3158.21s]  It was I think the whole month of June.
[3159.93s -> 3162.23s]  Was it all of June or was it like just two weeks into how
[3162.23s -> 3162.43s]  long?
[3162.43s -> 3164.73s]  Oh, yeah, my birthday is June.
[3165.43s -> 3169.03s]  Hey, my whole birthday is an entire month.
[3169.03s -> 3170.83s]  You better give me presents every day.
[3171.23s -> 3172.73s]  It was a painful birth.
[3186.22s -> 3187.52s]  He's a big guy.
[3187.92s -> 3189.42s]  Oh my God.
[3189.72s -> 3190.92s]  Are you done with your turn?
[3190.92s -> 3194.22s]  Dude, you can't you can't drop a fucking nuke like that
[3194.22s -> 3195.62s]  and they don't expect me to take a minute.
[3196.61s -> 3197.11s]  All right.
[3197.41s -> 3198.11s]  What do we need?
[3204.16s -> 3206.06s]  How about how about just a block?
[3206.06s -> 3206.76s]  Sounds good.
[3207.30s -> 3208.20s]  That sounds good to me.
[3209.03s -> 3209.93s]  Hey, you want some card draw?
[3212.39s -> 3213.89s]  I'm done with my turn.
[3214.29s -> 3216.19s]  I needed that card a while ago.
[3216.19s -> 3216.69s]  Did you?
[3216.99s -> 3218.29s]  Well, you need to communicate.
[3221.28s -> 3222.18s]  I think we're gonna lose.
[3230.03s -> 3231.33s]  Wait, don't do anything yet.
[3232.80s -> 3233.60s]  Did you get a good card?
[3236.30s -> 3237.10s]  Mildly.
[3239.73s -> 3240.23s]  Oh, wait.
[3240.23s -> 3242.83s]  Okay, deal five additional damage if the monster has block.
[3244.04s -> 3245.14s]  Does the whopper have block?
[3247.18s -> 3247.78s]  Not yet.
[3250.66s -> 3251.16s]  What did you just do?
[3251.16s -> 3251.56s]  I got him.
[3252.86s -> 3253.36s]  I got him.
[3253.36s -> 3254.36s]  Shit, that was pretty cool.
[3254.46s -> 3254.66s]  All right.
[3254.66s -> 3255.56s]  Well, I'll kill this guy now.
[3255.66s -> 3256.16s]  No, I won't.
[3256.26s -> 3257.16s]  You just took all my mana.
[3258.98s -> 3259.38s]  Did I?
[3259.38s -> 3261.78s]  How I took your mana?
[3262.44s -> 3262.84s]  I don't know.
[3265.84s -> 3268.74s]  Just go pull up my stream and rewind the VOD to see what you did.
[3279.52s -> 3281.52s]  We definitely have had this conversation before but
[3283.85s -> 3285.25s]  I can just kill that guy up there.
[3287.44s -> 3288.54s]  I'm gonna wait till the whopper has.
[3288.84s -> 3292.44s]  Okay, so I can kill a wounded monster with 10 or less HP.
[3293.50s -> 3296.10s]  Should we just get wait until the whopper is 10?
[3299.35s -> 3301.25s]  Dude, I think we're totally fine.
[3301.55s -> 3302.75s]  I don't think it really matters.
[3320.63s -> 3324.03s]  Thought they haven't said anything in literally 30 seconds time to leave.
[3324.93s -> 3326.90s]  That's what I do.
[3326.90s -> 3328.10s]  I'm just gonna keep kicking them.
[3329.21s -> 3330.21s]  Yeah, just keep pushing them back.
[3337.12s -> 3337.62s]  All right.
[3339.50s -> 3341.10s]  I mean, I should have waited till I did that.
[3342.56s -> 3343.66s]  I didn't take any damage.
[3344.55s -> 3345.55s]  I got 12 armor.
[3349.26s -> 3351.46s]  Every time I play an arrow, I get four block.
[3352.00s -> 3352.70s]  Is this game fun?
[3352.80s -> 3353.90s]  Yeah, actually it's pretty fun.
[3356.42s -> 3356.82s]  I like it.
[3356.82s -> 3357.42s]  Do you like it?
[3358.28s -> 3359.18s]  I like it so far.
[3368.36s -> 3368.96s]  We got the whopper.
[3368.96s -> 3369.76s]  Destroyed.
[3372.28s -> 3374.88s]  I was gonna sing like the Burger King song thing, but no.
[3375.59s -> 3376.69s]  No, I'm not doing that.
[3378.67s -> 3382.74s]  It's like that would be like dumb.
[3384.04s -> 3385.54s]  That would be very silly.
[3385.54s -> 3386.34s]  Yeah, it would be.
[3390.38s -> 3391.08s]  Keep killing.
[3394.20s -> 3396.20s]  That's like wow keyboard turned.
[3405.46s -> 3406.96s]  I just like want this because I just think of that.
[3407.06s -> 3418.66s]  Okay, gain one stamina for every eighth damage you deal and two stamina.
[3418.66s -> 3421.26s]  If the monsters attack leaves you with block.
[3422.23s -> 3428.96s]  Okay, so if I have too much block, I'll take I'll take the taunt.
[3429.36s -> 3430.06s]  That sounds fine.
[3431.98s -> 3433.88s]  You have nine money.
[3434.48s -> 3435.68s]  Yeah, what do you want me to do with it?
[3436.42s -> 3437.22s]  I just have a lot.
[3440.15s -> 3442.45s]  You're I also have like 18 more health than you.
[3442.45s -> 3443.25s]  What are you doing?
[3448.54s -> 3451.14s]  All heroes get two block at the start of each turn the next battle.
[3451.14s -> 3451.64s]  That sounds great.
[3451.64s -> 3453.54s]  We're going with this is a boss coming up real.
[3454.27s -> 3455.57s]  Wait, wasn't that just the boss?
[3455.67s -> 3456.27s]  I don't think so.
[3458.42s -> 3459.12s]  I'm gonna do that one.
[3461.64s -> 3470.66s]  And then I'm gonna remove that like the heel.
[3472.83s -> 3474.63s]  I think this is the boss, right?
[3474.63s -> 3478.23s]  Because one floor six the whopper was the boss.
[3478.63s -> 3480.03s]  Well, how come we have another boss then?
[3481.03s -> 3482.03s]  Okay, maybe we have another one.
[3482.03s -> 3482.43s]  Hold on.
[3482.73s -> 3484.23s]  Wait, that was a special whopper.
[3484.96s -> 3485.66s]  What did that say?
[3486.40s -> 3490.30s]  I think well my screen that said was a special whopper that things got
[3490.30s -> 3492.60s]  pickles mustard relish onions on it.
[3492.60s -> 3493.80s]  That's a special whopper.
[3494.34s -> 3497.99s]  Floor five was the whopper.
[3498.39s -> 3503.04s]  If we have that we're going against another whopper on floor eight.
[3503.44s -> 3504.74s]  We just did the whopper.
[3504.84s -> 3506.04s]  Now you got to pick floor six.
[3506.34s -> 3509.64s]  Yeah, I have one choice for floor six and it is the whopper.
[3511.58s -> 3512.68s]  We either we have different things.
[3512.78s -> 3514.98s]  So there's another look at look at my look at see.
[3514.98s -> 3516.78s]  Okay, then we got another whopper coming in.
[3516.78s -> 3518.48s]  I didn't have a choice of another whopper.
[3518.48s -> 3519.68s]  I thought we had the same choices.
[3527.52s -> 3529.52s]  Grimishake was the one of the worst milkshakes I've ever had.
[3530.16s -> 3530.86s]  I wanted to try it.
[3530.86s -> 3531.46s]  I was just late.
[3535.36s -> 3537.66s]  I thought you were going to go in there and do McDonald's and ask
[3537.66s -> 3539.16s]  for a whopper is where that was going.
[3542.45s -> 3544.05s]  That's no that is like that.
[3544.35s -> 3546.55s]  That's oh, that is a spectral whopper.
[3547.03s -> 3549.13s]  Yeah, that's bigger than the boss whopper.
[3549.80s -> 3551.20s]  Where is the whopper?
[3551.99s -> 3553.19s]  Oh, right.
[3554.76s -> 3555.36s]  Summon.
[3558.78s -> 3560.28s]  What is this puffy corpse?
[3563.70s -> 3565.80s]  I honestly thought whopper was the punch line.
[3566.10s -> 3567.70s]  Um, I don't think there was a punch line.
[3567.70s -> 3570.20s]  We just was saying whopper because he said it and we was like,
[3570.20s -> 3572.50s]  oh whopper and then we started talking about like McDonald's
[3572.50s -> 3573.20s]  Grimishakes.
[3575.18s -> 3577.98s]  I still can't get over the fucking comment you made earlier.
[3580.79s -> 3582.59s]  It's like fucking up my whole day, by the way.
[3584.19s -> 3586.89s]  Okay, I I'm sorry.
[3586.99s -> 3588.39s]  I thought it would make your day better.
[3589.09s -> 3591.09s]  I mean it was it was a wild comment.
[3595.07s -> 3596.17s]  Should I taunt something?
[3599.62s -> 3602.92s]  I'm getting I'm taking nine damage at the moment.
[3602.92s -> 3605.22s]  You are taking a lot of damage from what I don't know where
[3605.22s -> 3605.82s]  it's coming.
[3605.92s -> 3607.42s]  Oh the two ranged guys.
[3607.42s -> 3610.02s]  Oh all the way like I have to scroll up.
[3610.42s -> 3612.32s]  Wait, what there's a big guy up.
[3612.32s -> 3614.12s]  Oh, you can actually move the camera.
[3614.86s -> 3618.86s]  Yeah, WASD works.
[3618.86s -> 3619.66s]  I'm gonna stun him.
[3624.77s -> 3625.37s]  That's my turn.
[3625.37s -> 3627.07s]  I guess I'm taking six.
[3634.64s -> 3635.74s]  Did you have the Grimishake?
[3637.12s -> 3639.48s]  No, I did not.
[3640.19s -> 3643.79s]  Did you want Grimishake at any point in your life in June?
[3644.82s -> 3645.72s]  No, I didn't.
[3646.65s -> 3649.85s]  I didn't I legitimately didn't even consider it as an option.
[3650.69s -> 3653.69s]  I didn't I saw all the TikToks.
[3654.59s -> 3656.09s]  It never triggered in my brain.
[3656.09s -> 3658.69s]  Wait, that's a real thing that people can acquire.
[3661.83s -> 3663.03s]  Dude, they're blasting me.
[3665.43s -> 3668.53s]  I tried to give you some protection, but it didn't really
[3668.53s -> 3668.93s]  work.
[3674.28s -> 3675.58s]  Why didn't you use a deep breath?
[3677.76s -> 3679.76s]  I think that's not for me.
[3679.76s -> 3682.16s]  I think I mean, I think that's not for that's only for me.
[3684.08s -> 3684.68s]  We're gonna be fine.
[3686.16s -> 3686.86s]  I'm gonna be fine.
[3688.20s -> 3688.40s]  Yeah.
[3688.40s -> 3689.90s]  What about the Hamburglar's birthday?
[3689.90s -> 3691.60s]  Yeah, does this mean we're gonna get a birthday for every
[3691.60s -> 3692.40s]  McDonald's character?
[3692.80s -> 3696.57s]  I mean now now they're gonna do it like that the Hamburglar's
[3696.57s -> 3701.54s]  birthday and the meal and the the fries and the is this like
[3701.54s -> 3703.04s]  a bunch of characters that all had birthdays.
[3705.52s -> 3706.72s]  It's my wife's birthday today.
[3707.36s -> 3709.10s]  Happy birthday birthday.
[3709.10s -> 3709.50s]  Thank you.
[3709.50s -> 3713.62s]  I've been waiting for you to say that you're about to die.
[3714.96s -> 3716.46s]  You know, they all want me.
[3716.86s -> 3717.56s]  Can you help?
[3723.04s -> 3723.74s]  I can do that.
[3725.20s -> 3726.00s]  I can do that.
[3726.77s -> 3730.18s]  Can you kill one of the like guys trying to shoot me?
[3730.18s -> 3732.58s]  No, I have card draw and two damage.
[3732.58s -> 3733.18s]  That's all I have.
[3746.40s -> 3747.30s]  Your cards suck.
[3761.13s -> 3762.23s]  Hamburglar is bad.
[3762.23s -> 3767.61s]  He doesn't get a birthday there.
[3767.61s -> 3771.65s]  Okay, out of like the the tier list of McDonald's characters
[3771.65s -> 3773.45s]  the Hamburglar probably is pretty low.
[3775.30s -> 3781.78s]  I would say can you name the tier list of burgers?
[3782.70s -> 3783.50s]  What do you mean wrong?
[3783.60s -> 3785.80s]  I could you I think I could do some of them.
[3788.80s -> 3791.10s]  There's the Hamburglar, there's Grimace and then there's Ronald
[3791.10s -> 3794.44s]  McDonald and then there's a girl one.
[3794.98s -> 3796.18s]  There's also the fry.
[3796.18s -> 3799.08s]  There's like the there's like the nugget crew, right?
[3799.48s -> 3800.78s]  Isn't it like a whole chicken nugget crew?
[3800.78s -> 3803.08s]  This is not my area of expertise.
[3807.93s -> 3811.74s]  I don't the Hamburglar's schtick was like, Hamburglar was
[3811.74s -> 3814.14s]  gonna go on screen and go like what does he say?
[3814.34s -> 3816.34s]  He says that he has like says two words in a row and it's
[3816.34s -> 3818.37s]  like, what is it?
[3818.37s -> 3819.37s]  It's like, what is it?
[3821.46s -> 3821.96s]  What is it?
[3821.96s -> 3825.26s]  Yeah, rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble, right?
[3825.26s -> 3828.16s]  And then they would like speed up the footage by like 30%
[3828.16s -> 3831.76s]  and they would run around in a circle and anytime the
[3831.76s -> 3835.36s]  Hamburglar was in a commercial you could expect a 30 to 40%
[3835.36s -> 3843.27s]  fast-forward moment and it was like they do this every time.
[3843.67s -> 3844.87s]  I'm gonna kill.
[3845.63s -> 3848.63s]  So McDonald's commercials were upsetting to you as a child.
[3848.83s -> 3852.88s]  No, I just you think you could have done them better.
[3852.98s -> 3853.28s]  Yeah.
[3854.40s -> 3869.51s]  Yes, going in my notebook cataloging early German thoughts
[3869.51s -> 3870.51s]  and belief systems.
[3871.34s -> 3873.34s]  Well, when I was younger, I didn't think that but now
[3873.34s -> 3874.34s]  thinking back I could be like, you know what?
[3874.34s -> 3876.24s]  I could probably do a pretty good McDonald's commercial
[3879.97s -> 3881.67s]  bring back like a weird cartoon shit.
[3886.03s -> 3888.75s]  No, why not?
[3888.75s -> 3893.34s]  Everyone trying to kill me help I can taunt.
[3893.34s -> 3895.74s]  All right, who should I taunt who's doing the most damage?
[3896.34s -> 3900.18s]  I'm gonna taunt this one then now that it's okay.
[3900.28s -> 3901.38s]  Now it looks good.
[3902.10s -> 3905.00s]  We'll give us some block and then that's good.
[3906.89s -> 3907.29s]  There you go.
[3916.74s -> 3919.70s]  How all right I can get rid of this one on the left don't
[3919.70s -> 3922.64s]  attack wait 10 or less, right?
[3923.44s -> 3925.04s]  Can you do one damage to the big guy?
[3928.69s -> 3928.99s]  Yes.
[3929.09s -> 3929.69s]  No.
[3931.86s -> 3932.16s]  Yes.
[3937.42s -> 3939.22s]  What that what did you do?
[3942.24s -> 3946.34s]  I don't know do it says deal double the amount of damage
[3946.34s -> 3947.24s]  is my gems.
[3947.24s -> 3949.14s]  I have eight gems and it did for damage.
[3958.81s -> 3961.61s]  Bermis has an undertale song in his playlist.
[3962.51s -> 3964.71s]  Oh, he never takes more damage than a single hit.
[3964.71s -> 3966.41s]  He never takes more than four damage a single hit.
[3966.71s -> 3968.11s]  He never takes more for damage.
[3972.74s -> 3975.14s]  First of all, is that an official grimace playlist that
[3975.14s -> 3976.54s]  you're talking about on Spotify?
[3977.40s -> 3979.20s]  Because what what do you mean?
[3980.84s -> 3985.14s]  There's a this is there an official birthday playlist.
[3990.58s -> 3991.48s]  You can't listen to that.
[3991.58s -> 3992.78s]  It's insane.
[3994.19s -> 4001.88s]  It's really what a lot.
[4001.88s -> 4006.91s]  Wait, how much block do I got enough the perfect amount
[4008.82s -> 4009.52s]  you kill that now.
[4010.70s -> 4016.81s]  I am out of actions.
[4016.81s -> 4017.61s]  Don't play it.
[4017.91s -> 4020.71s]  I I'm not playing the grimace playlist right now.
[4022.26s -> 4023.36s]  Maybe we'll listen to it tomorrow.
[4024.02s -> 4024.62s]  Coward.
[4028.56s -> 4029.86s]  They're trying to kill me.
[4034.98s -> 4036.48s]  You could deal three damage to him.
[4037.64s -> 4038.04s]  Come on.
[4038.04s -> 4038.64s]  I'll go.
[4038.64s -> 4041.30s]  I actually don't think I can come on.
[4041.30s -> 4046.66s]  Yes, I can now.
[4046.66s -> 4047.96s]  You only going to take 10 damage.
[4047.96s -> 4049.16s]  How much health you have you've 30 health.
[4049.16s -> 4049.56s]  You're fine.
[4051.08s -> 4052.98s]  Yeah, but it's it like goes away forever.
[4054.52s -> 4070.15s]  I'm never going to get this youth back who's got block.
[4075.46s -> 4083.38s]  You got this student him wait.
[4084.81s -> 4087.78s]  This will be how much would this be?
[4087.78s -> 4092.73s]  This will be for one health left.
[4093.73s -> 4094.43s]  I was counting.
[4094.43s -> 4095.73s]  What were we talking about?
[4097.28s -> 4098.08s]  Grimace shake.
[4098.78s -> 4102.18s]  You see he drank to do grimace shake and he got the purple on him
[4105.11s -> 4106.21s]  regems for that.
[4113.48s -> 4114.08s]  That's a good one.
[4114.08s -> 4114.68s]  I like this one.
[4126.94s -> 4128.14s]  I don't want to remove any cards.
[4130.36s -> 4132.66s]  So, okay, Slay the Spire did this too.
[4133.84s -> 4136.74s]  We're removing cards always felt like I don't want to take anything away.
[4136.74s -> 4137.94s]  Don't don't want to add more.
[4137.94s -> 4139.04s]  I don't want to take cards.
[4140.11s -> 4142.71s]  You can press back at the bottom left and skip rewards.
[4145.04s -> 4146.84s]  I'm not I'm not taking anything either.
[4152.04s -> 4152.54s]  Brown.
[4155.96s -> 4156.96s]  That's actually really good.
[4172.41s -> 4173.31s]  Oh, I'll take that too.
[4174.88s -> 4176.68s]  There's a lot of reading going on right now.
[4178.29s -> 4179.99s]  You think we're going to get to the final floor?
[4182.02s -> 4185.32s]  Maybe index are better than decks bloated with garbage.
[4185.82s -> 4186.92s]  That that makes sense.
[4202.29s -> 4203.29s]  What's your nighttime routine?
[4205.16s -> 4208.46s]  I just go into my bedroom and I go straight on my back like that
[4208.46s -> 4210.66s]  close my eyes and I don't move until I fall asleep.
[4217.09s -> 4218.29s]  That about sums up for me too.
[4220.02s -> 4221.42s]  I take my horse tranquilizer.
[4224.64s -> 4225.24s]  I'm out.
[4233.40s -> 4235.40s]  Yeah, I really am just iPad.
[4236.88s -> 4237.38s]  I hate it.
[4237.38s -> 4240.78s]  But so I'll just kind of lie in bed.
[4240.78s -> 4241.48s]  Do you do this too?
[4242.21s -> 4244.51s]  I just kind of lie like when I'm ready to go to bed.
[4244.81s -> 4245.51s]  It's like, all right.
[4245.71s -> 4246.51s]  I have my iPad.
[4246.51s -> 4251.66s]  I've got like games and like videos and okay, like TV shows.
[4252.50s -> 4256.40s]  I'll look at the clock and I'll be like Jesus what the hell is going on?
[4256.40s -> 4258.00s]  Like two hours have gone by.
[4258.00s -> 4259.70s]  I was supposed to go to bed like three hours ago.
[4259.80s -> 4264.03s]  Two hours ago and then I just go put it down and get away from it.
[4264.23s -> 4265.84s]  I do not do that.
[4265.84s -> 4269.34s]  I take my horse tranquilizer and then I go to bed.
[4271.57s -> 4273.57s]  Part of me is starting to understand that this is not a joke.
[4275.20s -> 4279.20s]  I am not a phone reader on the toilet like you are.
[4279.30s -> 4282.20s]  I'm not a device addicted.
[4282.80s -> 4284.80s]  You know, I can I can just let it go.
[4284.80s -> 4288.20s]  I feel like I could hear your like lips moving to say idiot.
[4289.30s -> 4290.20s]  I could hear it.
[4290.60s -> 4292.20s]  I'm not a device addicted.
[4293.00s -> 4297.80s]  I could hear like the idiot no judgment in my tone.
[4298.10s -> 4301.80s]  If you're going to have to sit on the toilet and read your phone and go to bed and read your phone.
[4301.80s -> 4302.80s]  There is no judgment.
[4302.80s -> 4304.60s]  But if you want to do that, that's fine.
[4304.60s -> 4307.50s]  I guess I'm going to get I'm going to die this round by the way.
[4307.50s -> 4309.70s]  You're killing me moment.
[4309.90s -> 4311.90s]  Yeah, you should like start playing cards.
[4311.90s -> 4313.70s]  I feel like I've been doing a lot for you.
[4314.53s -> 4315.33s]  Now it's time to you.
[4315.43s -> 4318.23s]  You gained a four block for your turn.
[4318.23s -> 4321.43s]  Look how many I don't have what other cards that I have to play.
[4321.93s -> 4324.33s]  What have you been selecting every time we go to a ball?
[4328.00s -> 4331.00s]  Let me take the hamburger is commercials were not good.
[4331.00s -> 4332.20s]  Okay, they sped it up.
[4332.20s -> 4334.90s]  They did chase the hamburger burglar around.
[4336.21s -> 4336.81s]  Here we go.
[4336.81s -> 4337.11s]  All right.
[4337.11s -> 4337.21s]  Now.
[4337.21s -> 4337.61s]  I'm good.
[4337.61s -> 4337.91s]  I'm good.
[4337.91s -> 4338.21s]  I got you.
[4338.21s -> 4338.51s]  I got you.
[4338.51s -> 4338.91s]  I got you.
[4341.54s -> 4342.34s]  What's priority?
[4345.69s -> 4348.69s]  But you're not communicating to any of your cards do stuff like that.
[4348.69s -> 4349.99s]  I put this you okay.
[4350.09s -> 4354.39s]  Here's my every turn you just go like and then I'm just like, okay, what do we do?
[4354.39s -> 4355.89s]  We're supposed to be communicating as a team.
[4359.51s -> 4360.01s]  Are we?
[4360.99s -> 4362.39s]  We're standing next to each other.
[4366.97s -> 4372.58s]  What my turns over here the cards I had defend me.
[4373.08s -> 4373.88s]  What do you think I'm doing?
[4376.60s -> 4379.29s]  I guess I'm going to swing it this person.
[4380.80s -> 4381.90s]  What are you reading on your phone?
[4381.90s -> 4382.20s]  What's up?
[4382.20s -> 4383.20s]  What's on the iPad?
[4383.20s -> 4383.60s]  Are you doing you?
[4383.60s -> 4387.96s]  That's when your mobile game time is I actually don't use a device really at
[4387.96s -> 4390.36s]  all unless I'm on the toilet or in bed.
[4390.46s -> 4391.26s]  I don't use it ever.
[4395.28s -> 4397.98s]  You can't follow up that statement by I don't use it ever.
[4397.98s -> 4400.48s]  We have to kill this whopper up here by the way, because they just look at
[4400.48s -> 4403.78s]  how much shit this I know there's a lot of stuff on your side of the
[4403.78s -> 4404.48s]  battlefield.
[4404.68s -> 4409.08s]  Yeah, but I have gained two block and like deal for damage.
[4409.78s -> 4410.08s]  Okay.
[4410.08s -> 4412.28s]  Maybe you should be picking some cards that do things.
[4414.14s -> 4414.54s]  Hey.
[4414.74s -> 4415.34s]  Oh, yeah.
[4417.54s -> 4418.34s]  What about this?
[4424.13s -> 4427.79s]  Oh, what's this minus 24?
[4427.79s -> 4428.99s]  That's about to kill you.
[4439.38s -> 4442.38s]  I think we just is this is a game where you lose and you put like points
[4442.38s -> 4443.48s]  into permanent upgrades, right?
[4446.00s -> 4447.60s]  I don't think I don't think we could have beaten this.
[4448.72s -> 4452.12s]  I mean, I don't want this to be one of those games where you have to lose
[4452.12s -> 4452.72s]  to win.
[4453.20s -> 4455.47s]  I would like to just kill them.
[4455.87s -> 4456.87s]  I think we just die.
[4458.24s -> 4461.85s]  I think that's I mean me the first time ever playing it.
[4463.44s -> 4464.04s]  Who's killing you?
[4464.04s -> 4465.94s]  Who's the who's doing the most damage to you right now?
[4465.94s -> 4469.44s]  I hate the problem of throw just throw a stone dude that everybody
[4469.44s -> 4470.14s]  is hurting me here.
[4472.34s -> 4473.84s]  I actually I actually die still.
[4475.15s -> 4475.95s]  No, you don't you're good.
[4476.25s -> 4478.35s]  I have actually have to you're right.
[4478.35s -> 4481.15s]  It would be flashing emergency colors.
[4481.15s -> 4486.09s]  If you were going to die and you guys watch the FNAF trailer after you
[4486.49s -> 4487.29s]  I've already done that.
[4487.29s -> 4488.29s]  I'm not watching another one.
[4488.79s -> 4491.39s]  They're going to come up with like five trailers of the next six months.
[4491.39s -> 4492.56s]  I'm not watching them all.
[4492.76s -> 4495.66s]  Isn't it kind of crazy though that they're making a five nights movies
[4495.66s -> 4506.48s]  just because I played it or your trailers.
[4506.48s -> 4508.98s]  I'm not a big fan of trailers, especially when they make like eight
[4508.98s -> 4513.16s]  of them and it effectively they just they they take a scene they
[4513.16s -> 4517.78s]  take a scene from every single scene in the entire movie and over
[4517.78s -> 4519.28s]  the course of like five trailers.
[4519.28s -> 4521.58s]  You won't you've almost seen the entire movie.
[4521.58s -> 4522.68s]  I watched the trailer.
[4522.68s -> 4525.82s]  I was like, okay, so that's how it ends, right?
[4525.82s -> 4527.22s]  Like that's the whole plot.
[4527.22s -> 4530.52s]  That's everything if you took like the three or four five different
[4530.52s -> 4533.92s]  trailers, some of these big franchises do you can take out all the
[4533.92s -> 4535.92s]  scenes and be like, well, there's a scene from literally every
[4535.92s -> 4536.92s]  single scene in the movie.
[4537.80s -> 4539.60s]  You already did this rant, but we're doing it again.
[4540.82s -> 4543.12s]  Some people haven't heard it and some people haven't awoken.
[4543.42s -> 4544.22s]  You're dying.
[4544.32s -> 4545.12s]  I know I am.
[4546.62s -> 4548.52s]  Wait, can you kill one enemy this game?
[4548.52s -> 4563.01s]  I can I can I can kill this guy and then I can kill this one,
[4564.51s -> 4566.51s]  which is this one's doing five.
[4568.12s -> 4569.82s]  Good luck because I lose.
[4575.63s -> 4576.33s]  No, you don't.
[4576.63s -> 4577.43s]  Are you going to save me?
[4577.63s -> 4579.13s]  There's got to be a way to save you.
[4579.13s -> 4582.43s]  There's simply got to be a way to kill every enemy this time.
[4582.43s -> 4585.33s]  There's no way I had the summoner on my side.
[4590.89s -> 4591.99s]  You got six health.
[4593.39s -> 4594.79s]  I'm about to take 22.
[4595.23s -> 4596.53s]  So technically 10.
[4598.79s -> 4599.19s]  All right.
[4599.19s -> 4600.59s]  I think I think this is over.
[4603.79s -> 4605.89s]  They all came with they all walked over to my side.
[4611.74s -> 4612.74s]  Death is not the end.
[4613.14s -> 4614.14s]  You've fallen in battle.
[4614.24s -> 4616.94s]  You can no longer play cards or take other active actions during this
[4616.94s -> 4617.24s]  fight.
[4617.24s -> 4620.14s]  If your team survives, you'll get rewards as usual.
[4622.05s -> 4626.71s]  I wait I can stay if you can do this somehow.
[4626.91s -> 4628.11s]  Then we continue.
[4630.21s -> 4632.51s]  I don't there's that awful at this game.
[4633.27s -> 4634.27s]  Well, hold on.
[4634.74s -> 4637.94s]  This is a game that I would never normally really play and it's also the
[4637.94s -> 4639.54s]  first time we've ever played it.
[4640.60s -> 4643.20s]  Why don't do we not just get any slack at all?
[4644.50s -> 4645.90s]  We don't get any slack at all.
[4646.96s -> 4648.06s]  No, you're dead weight.
[4650.45s -> 4651.95s]  You just took that personally.
[4656.92s -> 4658.62s]  Are you some they're all summoning?
[4659.83s -> 4660.73s]  This is what I'm telling you.
[4660.73s -> 4663.53s]  I was I was telling you there was a summoner on my side and you were
[4663.53s -> 4666.13s]  busy talking about grimace was trying to kill him.
[4674.03s -> 4676.43s]  Okay, but like to any of your cards do stuff like this.
[4677.23s -> 4679.26s]  No, why not?
[4679.56s -> 4682.03s]  I don't know because I what happened.
[4682.03s -> 4683.13s]  Maybe I should pick some of them.
[4683.33s -> 4684.63s]  Yeah, I don't have any of that.
[4686.25s -> 4689.25s]  I have gained block and hurt with block.
[4690.76s -> 4691.76s]  I am one.
[4693.84s -> 4696.24s]  I'm I'm I'm dead by two damage.
[4696.34s -> 4703.96s]  No, no, you're a streamer.
[4703.96s -> 4705.66s]  You should know how to play every game ever.
[4711.24s -> 4711.44s]  All right.
[4711.44s -> 4715.68s]  So now what happens we unlocked stuff.
[4719.72s -> 4722.26s]  Okay, there we go.
[4722.36s -> 4723.76s]  We got a rare voice line.
[4724.56s -> 4729.75s]  Oh, you got you got the new spray new artifact.
[4738.10s -> 4739.10s]  This is Harley Quinn.
[4739.60s -> 4742.20s]  You finished your run your heroes died, but the world mysteriously
[4742.20s -> 4744.40s]  reset to the time before they embarked on their quest.
[4744.80s -> 4747.10s]  Maybe the next heroes you create will avenge them and break this
[4747.10s -> 4750.90s]  cycle with each finished run you unlock new cards and artifacts
[4750.90s -> 4752.20s]  for the next heroes to use.
[4753.77s -> 4755.27s]  So we get better stuff.
[4757.16s -> 4759.86s]  We got one new artifact unlocked basically.
[4760.06s -> 4764.57s]  Okay, you want to go again?
[4765.24s -> 4766.54s]  Yeah, do you want to go again?
[4767.96s -> 4768.26s]  Yeah.
[4768.36s -> 4768.66s]  Okay.
[4768.66s -> 4769.36s]  Yeah, let's do it.
[4770.29s -> 4771.39s]  You want to throw me an invite?
[4774.21s -> 4774.81s]  I'll do it again.
[4775.94s -> 4778.24s]  I mean, it's not we're not going to be it's not going to be
[4779.76s -> 4781.36s]  probably not going to be better than the last time.
[4781.96s -> 4789.48s]  Wait, what wants me to make a new character new character?
[4791.78s -> 4793.68s]  Can I get a coffee and be back in like two minutes?
[4796.02s -> 4797.02s]  I want I need another coffee.
[4798.91s -> 4799.31s]  Sure.
[4800.19s -> 4800.49s]  Sure.
[4800.49s -> 4801.29s]  You go.
[4801.29s -> 4802.89s]  I'll take care of everything.
[4804.01s -> 4805.31s]  Well, you just have to invite me to your game.
[4805.31s -> 4806.51s]  I'll do the stream.
[4807.47s -> 4810.27s]  I'll do everything in the mission.
[4812.45s -> 4815.25s]  Oh, no, it's our artifacts are things you start with that
[4815.25s -> 4816.85s]  makes more sense.
[4816.85s -> 4819.65s]  You'll see and I had to make a new character and that new
[4819.65s -> 4820.75s]  character got the artifact.
[4821.05s -> 4821.25s]  All right.
[4821.25s -> 4823.45s]  I'm going to be and grab another coffee.
[4826.45s -> 4827.05s]  I'll be right back.
[4827.72s -> 4832.67s]  Okay, don't mute stir.
[4832.77s -> 4834.17s]  You haven't been on this channel for a long time.
[4834.17s -> 4834.87s]  I'm not muted.
[4836.44s -> 4838.65s]  Well, you're about to be thank God.
[4838.65s -> 4842.89s]  Yeah, don't mute nice minute.
[4846.36s -> 4847.06s]  I have right back.
[5140.96s -> 5141.56s]  I am back.
[5142.89s -> 5144.79s]  I am back and you are
[5145.19s -> 5148.19s]  but I've never met her you are unmuted and let me just
[5148.19s -> 5149.09s]  tell you something right now.
[5149.56s -> 5151.76s]  You made me laugh so bad.
[5151.76s -> 5155.14s]  I was in the middle of I was mid piss and I thought about
[5155.14s -> 5157.14s]  the fucking grimace comment again, and I think you actually
[5157.14s -> 5160.45s]  hurt me like it hurt.
[5160.65s -> 5161.85s]  I was I just sit in the pain.
[5161.85s -> 5163.25s]  It's just like I just thought of it.
[5163.35s -> 5165.25s]  It's thought of the fucking comment and just like I
[5165.25s -> 5165.95s]  I'll it hurt.
[5166.52s -> 5167.92s]  That's this stream was a success.
[5167.92s -> 5170.62s]  Then I want it like I want you to be in pain from at least
[5170.62s -> 5171.72s]  one joke per stream.
[5173.62s -> 5176.52s]  I feel like I don't have to do another like it's already
[5176.52s -> 5182.22s]  enough.
[5182.42s -> 5182.82s]  All right.
[5184.07s -> 5184.67s]  We good.
[5186.44s -> 5188.04s]  I invited you you got to join.
[5188.24s -> 5189.34s]  Oh, there's an invite.
[5193.85s -> 5196.75s]  You know, I knew I knew you were going to do that.
[5196.95s -> 5199.15s]  You what make a mage.
[5200.38s -> 5202.28s]  I feel like you're the one coming in saying I don't
[5202.28s -> 5203.38s]  understand these games.
[5203.38s -> 5205.28s]  How come you can't give me a break and you're like, okay,
[5205.28s -> 5206.88s]  I learned all the warrior cards.
[5207.62s -> 5209.72s]  Let me make a mage now, which is probably going to be
[5209.72s -> 5210.72s]  more complicated.
[5211.12s -> 5213.22s]  Proud of you for choosing the like I'm dumb warrior.
[5213.22s -> 5216.44s]  I hit this was randomly generated.
[5217.27s -> 5217.87s]  All right.
[5218.17s -> 5219.27s]  Should I not be a mage?
[5219.57s -> 5220.87s]  You could be anything you want to be.
[5220.97s -> 5221.07s]  All right.
[5221.07s -> 5221.47s]  Let me see.
[5221.57s -> 5222.77s]  There's a lot of characters here.
[5222.77s -> 5223.37s]  Okay, hold on.
[5223.47s -> 5227.56s]  What's your favorite spell of all the spells lightning?
[5227.66s -> 5228.26s]  Absolutely.
[5228.66s -> 5230.86s]  What lightning you want for him ball lightning lightning
[5230.86s -> 5233.36s]  bolt lightning storm chain lightning.
[5236.85s -> 5237.45s]  Why there?
[5237.65s -> 5240.65s]  Why because I like lightning moves in games.
[5240.65s -> 5241.35s]  I think are fun.
[5241.85s -> 5245.52s]  Lightning is erratic lightning is it's like, whoa, it
[5245.52s -> 5247.12s]  could do this damage or could do that damage.
[5247.22s -> 5248.72s]  It's always kind of all over the place.
[5249.76s -> 5250.86s]  I think it's the most fun to play with.
[5253.86s -> 5255.53s]  So what are you going to do?
[5257.30s -> 5257.70s]  Hold on.
[5257.70s -> 5259.90s]  I'm going to do what I know right because like I'm not
[5259.90s -> 5265.38s]  I don't want to I got an artifact for the warrior
[5265.38s -> 5267.48s]  character a follow-up question.
[5268.53s -> 5269.83s]  We haven't talked about it in a while.
[5269.93s -> 5270.23s]  Okay.
[5270.23s -> 5270.63s]  What is it?
[5272.45s -> 5274.65s]  How quickly did you give up on Path of Exile?
[5275.74s -> 5281.39s]  No, I didn't know I didn't know I didn't know I played
[5281.39s -> 5283.99s]  a lot of peewee because I was kind of preparing for
[5283.99s -> 5287.54s]  peewee to you board you stop.
[5287.54s -> 5288.34s]  Where did I stop?
[5291.00s -> 5293.00s]  I don't act to maybe act three.
[5297.92s -> 5298.72s]  I think it's great.
[5298.82s -> 5302.71s]  I okay once I figured out what was going on like,
[5302.71s -> 5304.51s]  okay, I get it now and I think this is fun.
[5304.61s -> 5307.78s]  I think waiting for peewee to is smart.
[5307.78s -> 5314.16s]  I think that's what you said to it's a play is apparently
[5314.16s -> 5320.61s]  it's going to be longer than people thought but trying
[5320.61s -> 5322.81s]  to get the area that I was named some areas in like
[5322.81s -> 5325.69s]  Act two or three because I know that you were doing
[5325.69s -> 5327.69s]  the bandits and you were confused about the bandits
[5327.69s -> 5327.99s]  last.
[5327.99s -> 5328.29s]  Yes.
[5328.49s -> 5328.69s]  Okay.
[5328.69s -> 5329.19s]  Was it right?
[5329.19s -> 5329.79s]  It was after that.
[5329.79s -> 5331.99s]  It's probably like maybe four or five hours of game
[5331.99s -> 5332.79s]  time after that.
[5341.93s -> 5342.93s]  So you're not doing a mage.
[5342.93s -> 5344.13s]  Oh my God, this coward.
[5344.13s -> 5347.03s]  I think about a mage and he crumbles and he folds.
[5347.33s -> 5349.03s]  Well, I got an artifact.
[5349.54s -> 5352.04s]  Okay, let's play and this is going to make me better.
[5352.67s -> 5353.67s]  Yeah, we're going to win.
[5355.45s -> 5357.25s]  We're going to lose in the first like three or four
[5357.25s -> 5357.55s]  rooms.
[5357.55s -> 5359.75s]  Then we're going to play that game that you liked.
[5360.89s -> 5361.99s]  Well, you also linked a game.
[5361.99s -> 5363.09s]  We're going to have to like flip a coin.
[5364.17s -> 5367.77s]  I think is I think we would have more fun in your in
[5367.77s -> 5368.47s]  your suggestion.
[5369.34s -> 5371.84s]  Okay, but I think I would like to do your suggestion.
[5372.04s -> 5374.34s]  We could one day we absolutely could.
[5376.22s -> 5376.52s]  All right.
[5376.52s -> 5377.42s]  Now we get it.
[5377.72s -> 5379.72s]  So let's go.
[5379.92s -> 5381.42s]  Oh, I get it.
[5390.32s -> 5390.42s]  Yeah.
[5390.42s -> 5392.12s]  What do you think of that zombies?
[5393.83s -> 5395.63s]  I genuinely do like you.
[5395.63s -> 5398.73s]  We I warmed up to it.
[5404.42s -> 5404.62s]  Okay.
[5404.62s -> 5406.62s]  I mean, it's just that we talked it like we were last
[5406.62s -> 5408.62s]  talking about this kind of stuff like two weeks ago
[5408.62s -> 5409.62s]  and that's where you were.
[5409.72s -> 5411.12s]  So I guess you just stopped.
[5411.62s -> 5413.02s]  Oh, I've been busy.
[5413.12s -> 5415.62s]  I've been pretty busy at the honest answers.
[5415.62s -> 5416.32s]  I've been pretty busy.
[5417.59s -> 5418.19s]  I accept.
[5420.09s -> 5424.08s]  All right, three damage go which one is attacking this
[5424.08s -> 5424.78s]  one here.
[5426.45s -> 5427.45s]  You're get all dude.
[5427.45s -> 5428.15s]  He's getting it.
[5428.92s -> 5430.92s]  Yeah, this guy fucking gets it.
[5437.85s -> 5441.72s]  The man's a cool guy yet.
[5441.72s -> 5442.22s]  Yeah, I get it.
[5442.22s -> 5443.02s]  This man's getting it.
[5443.02s -> 5443.52s]  I'm getting it.
[5443.52s -> 5443.92s]  You're getting it.
[5443.92s -> 5444.62s]  We're all getting it.
[5445.22s -> 5446.62s]  I let him hit me by accident.
[5449.07s -> 5451.37s]  Wish I could give you my two block and we don't have
[5451.37s -> 5453.47s]  to pause every time I play a card and be like so
[5453.47s -> 5453.97s]  grimace.
[5455.40s -> 5459.48s]  I mean unless you've got another grimace take I see
[5459.48s -> 5461.18s]  you unless there's more to the grimace.
[5461.68s -> 5464.18s]  I mean, I'm feeling kind of empty inside like what's
[5464.18s -> 5466.38s]  the next tick-tock trend like we're like grimace is
[5466.38s -> 5466.78s]  over.
[5467.08s -> 5467.78s]  It's over.
[5468.18s -> 5468.78s]  What now?
[5469.08s -> 5469.58s]  I don't know.
[5469.88s -> 5471.08s]  I need my dopamine.
[5471.69s -> 5472.29s]  I don't know.
[5473.15s -> 5477.56s]  No, you have one damage the monster monsters attack
[5477.56s -> 5478.56s]  leaves you with walk.
[5480.48s -> 5481.48s]  I think it's this one here.
[5482.08s -> 5483.18s]  Just I just need damage.
[5483.18s -> 5484.38s]  I didn't have any last time.
[5492.44s -> 5493.64s]  What does strain do?
[5495.15s -> 5496.75s]  If you hover over it, it'll explain it.
[5496.75s -> 5500.14s]  I don't know hover over the card with it.
[5501.00s -> 5503.90s]  Okay, select one of three rare and legendary artifacts.
[5503.90s -> 5511.69s]  I want that I'm liking where this is going for me.
[5512.65s -> 5515.75s]  Whoa, keep unspent mana points between turns.
[5515.75s -> 5517.55s]  That seems kind of unbelievably good.
[5517.55s -> 5519.25s]  I hope I don't you got ice cream.
[5519.25s -> 5521.65s]  I hope I don't piss off everybody watching because I'm
[5521.65s -> 5522.15s]  not going to use it.
[5522.15s -> 5532.03s]  Well, I didn't mean to click that.
[5532.03s -> 5532.43s]  That's okay.
[5533.84s -> 5534.74s]  You can re-select.
[5536.44s -> 5538.34s]  Yeah, we need like upgrades and shit.
[5538.34s -> 5541.64s]  Yeah ice cream.
[5543.02s -> 5544.02s]  What's your favorite ice cream?
[5544.42s -> 5547.22s]  What's your like favorite like top three vanilla?
[5547.62s -> 5550.52s]  I never used to be a vanilla or what I feel like I
[5550.52s -> 5554.52s]  just awoke and became correct that my whole life.
[5554.62s -> 5555.92s]  People were like chocolate chocolate chocolate and
[5555.92s -> 5556.72s]  I was like, yeah chocolate.
[5556.72s -> 5559.02s]  So I like chocolate and then I kind of just woke up
[5559.02s -> 5564.64s]  one day and I was like, you know, okay.
[5564.64s -> 5566.84s]  Who I'm going to kill this person right now.
[5567.34s -> 5568.84s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, do not shoot
[5568.84s -> 5571.01s]  anyone in the in the in the near.
[5571.41s -> 5571.81s]  Okay.
[5573.49s -> 5575.09s]  How come I don't have something like that?
[5577.90s -> 5581.02s]  I don't know why don't you be rid of this guy.
[5581.42s -> 5583.22s]  I just deleted my whole hand, but it's okay.
[5586.55s -> 5586.85s]  All right.
[5586.85s -> 5587.45s]  Okay.
[5587.55s -> 5591.47s]  So chocolate vanilla strawberry.
[5591.47s -> 5592.47s]  Let's go with like the basics.
[5592.47s -> 5593.87s]  Your vanilla is what you would say.
[5595.95s -> 5597.45s]  We're talking about just the three basics.
[5597.65s -> 5601.55s]  I feel like we talked about this before I whenever we
[5601.55s -> 5602.65s]  can recycle content is fine.
[5603.05s -> 5606.25s]  Okay, my my go-to grocery store treat when I'm feeling
[5606.25s -> 5608.85s]  a little bit sussy is when I go to the ice cream
[5608.85s -> 5611.15s]  section at the Hebs in Texas.
[5611.15s -> 5613.82s]  They've got all these crazy flavors like all these
[5613.82s -> 5616.02s]  weird combos and they're always really really really
[5616.02s -> 5616.52s]  really good.
[5616.52s -> 5617.82s]  And so I like just try a new one.
[5617.82s -> 5624.79s]  I'm a new I'm going to try a new one that was pretty
[5624.79s -> 5626.89s]  cool as the staple and then beyond vanilla.
[5626.89s -> 5629.49s]  It's like I'm going to get a little bit crazy today
[5629.89s -> 5631.19s]  and you kill that other guy on the left.
[5633.01s -> 5633.61s]  Here we go.
[5633.61s -> 5634.11s]  Look at that.
[5637.90s -> 5641.24s]  Okay, so but okay, but strawberry chocolate vanilla
[5641.24s -> 5644.51s]  you are now a vanilla ice cream enjoyer.
[5646.72s -> 5649.62s]  I would say of the three base flavors.
[5650.26s -> 5653.53s]  I think it's strawberry for me with a very important
[5654.07s -> 5655.07s]  very important caveat.
[5655.80s -> 5658.00s]  It has to be smooth strawberry.
[5658.00s -> 5661.14s]  It cannot have strawberry chunks in it.
[5662.00s -> 5665.57s]  No, it has to be smooth strawberry ice cream.
[5666.37s -> 5667.77s]  No strawberry chunks.
[5669.08s -> 5671.88s]  There was one of those crazy sussy ice creams.
[5671.88s -> 5672.78s]  I was talking about.
[5673.08s -> 5677.00s]  That was a strawberry ice cream with chunks of like
[5677.00s -> 5678.34s]  cheesecake in it.
[5678.54s -> 5678.84s]  Okay, though.
[5678.84s -> 5679.34s]  That's all right.
[5679.44s -> 5679.84s]  That's good.
[5679.94s -> 5680.34s]  That's fine.
[5681.36s -> 5684.76s]  That that was kind of you know what I'm saying?
[5684.76s -> 5685.06s]  Yeah.
[5685.06s -> 5688.60s]  Oh, yeah hot for a minute, but just regular strawberry
[5688.60s -> 5689.00s]  ice cream.
[5689.00s -> 5693.20s]  I don't want strawberry chunks in it my all-time favorite
[5693.20s -> 5693.80s]  ice cream.
[5694.00s -> 5695.80s]  If we're just talking get away from like the base
[5695.80s -> 5701.22s]  flavorings chocolate chip cookie dough is it just
[5701.22s -> 5704.22s]  a date nothing compares and nothing ever will compare
[5704.22s -> 5704.62s]  to that.
[5704.72s -> 5706.72s]  I just don't think I can I have to wonder if I've told
[5706.72s -> 5708.72s]  you my chocolate chip cookie dough story.
[5709.12s -> 5709.62s]  I don't know.
[5709.72s -> 5710.72s]  Did you puke or something?
[5710.82s -> 5713.72s]  Did you eat it and puke no is Easter one year they
[5713.72s -> 5715.62s]  got the they had these like Easter chocolate chip
[5715.62s -> 5718.02s]  cookie like eggs you like unravel the egg and you
[5718.02s -> 5720.98s]  it's like just all like that kind of like Oreo
[5720.98s -> 5722.38s]  chocolate chip cookie dough thing.
[5722.89s -> 5726.49s]  Okay, and then I ate some of them and I got really
[5726.49s -> 5729.39s]  sick like really really really sick and then like a
[5729.39s -> 5732.09s]  week later the next like in the morning my brother
[5732.29s -> 5734.49s]  knowing that I got sick from these Easter eggs and
[5734.49s -> 5735.69s]  it was a big deal to me.
[5736.09s -> 5738.59s]  He took all of the Oreos out of an entire like
[5738.59s -> 5742.59s]  double sleeve of Oreo put all of the double stuff
[5742.59s -> 5745.09s]  Oreo into a baseball and just took a big bite out
[5745.09s -> 5745.39s]  of it.
[5745.39s -> 5746.29s]  Oh you did tell this.
[5746.29s -> 5747.59s]  Yeah, that's kind of gross.
[5748.22s -> 5748.62s]  Yeah.
[5748.72s -> 5749.12s]  Okay.
[5749.22s -> 5749.72s]  My bad.
[5749.82s -> 5751.12s]  I was a double storyteller.
[5751.12s -> 5756.56s]  You can banish me now clean your weapon transform
[5756.56s -> 5761.93s]  and upgrade sacrificial lung into what doesn't
[5761.93s -> 5762.13s]  set.
[5762.13s -> 5763.13s]  What is it transforming into?
[5764.13s -> 5769.10s]  It gives you like three options or two or three
[5769.10s -> 5769.60s]  options.
[5774.75s -> 5775.65s]  Whoo.
[5780.73s -> 5781.83s]  I'm going to let's go.
[5788.75s -> 5789.55s]  New cards.
[5789.55s -> 5791.91s]  Yeah, new artifacts.
[5791.91s -> 5793.11s]  That's what oh that's next.
[5795.60s -> 5799.00s]  Okay, but what is your we're talking not just base
[5799.00s -> 5799.60s]  flavors.
[5799.60s -> 5802.30s]  What is your favorite ice cream that could have any
[5802.30s -> 5806.68s]  amount of kind of combinations in it, but now
[5806.68s -> 5811.70s]  we'll yeah, but we're talking a different tier of
[5811.70s -> 5815.10s]  ice cream now like what other ice creams do you
[5815.10s -> 5817.00s]  like that aren't just a base flavor.
[5821.54s -> 5823.84s]  I think that it was the way I said the strawberry
[5823.84s -> 5825.14s]  with the cheesecake in it.
[5825.24s -> 5827.97s]  That was some high quality ice cream.
[5828.17s -> 5829.27s]  I'm going to drop this over here.
[5832.56s -> 5833.76s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5833.76s -> 5834.66s]  You just did something.
[5834.66s -> 5835.96s]  You just did something.
[5835.96s -> 5838.26s]  Yeah, I just killed everybody on your side.
[5838.26s -> 5839.06s]  We're winning this.
[5839.16s -> 5842.96s]  This is the run and then check this out.
[5843.85s -> 5846.68s]  Nah, I'll let you I'll let you be able to hit
[5846.68s -> 5847.18s]  something.
[5862.27s -> 5862.87s]  I'm doing it.
[5866.86s -> 5867.46s]  God damn it.
[5867.46s -> 5869.16s]  I spilled coffee fucking everywhere.
[5870.78s -> 5872.08s]  You're taking a lot of damage.
[5872.18s -> 5874.68s]  It's just everyone is everywhere and I don't
[5874.68s -> 5875.88s]  know what I don't know do about it.
[5878.54s -> 5879.74s]  Oh, I have to get it.
[5879.84s -> 5881.64s]  It's oh, it's I actually don't even know what to
[5881.64s -> 5882.34s]  do right now.
[5882.44s -> 5885.61s]  I wish I was there to help you pat you down.
[5885.61s -> 5886.11s]  It's all right.
[5900.60s -> 5901.50s]  I deserve it for making that.
[5901.50s -> 5904.00s]  I feel like this has happened the last like three
[5904.00s -> 5904.40s]  times.
[5904.40s -> 5907.80s]  It happens all the time all the time every time
[5909.07s -> 5910.87s]  because especially especially when I take a sip
[5910.87s -> 5911.37s]  of coffee.
[5911.37s -> 5916.19s]  I'm like who it's like I need to like relax.
[5916.79s -> 5918.39s]  I feel like two years from now.
[5918.39s -> 5920.99s]  You're going to be Hector from Breaking Bad with
[5920.99s -> 5925.02s]  a ding ding just rolling around waiting for help.
[5925.32s -> 5929.42s]  What it's you're progressing quickly.
[5930.45s -> 5933.54s]  Just wait till you get to be 37.
[5934.70s -> 5935.40s]  It's rough.
[5935.40s -> 5937.14s]  All right, man.
[5937.14s -> 5944.97s]  This hill is steep hold you right now for real almost
[5944.97s -> 5947.07s]  I'm almost dirty tweet.
[5947.97s -> 5952.72s]  I'm dirty doing a half as long as didn't get on
[5952.72s -> 5953.12s]  the ground.
[5953.12s -> 5954.32s]  I don't get on the ground.
[5955.53s -> 5958.33s]  There's a pool of coffee underneath my zero key
[5959.35s -> 5960.05s]  and that's over.
[5960.05s -> 5962.85s]  Say desk like from all of the times you've done this
[5962.85s -> 5964.35s]  and it's just going down.
[5964.35s -> 5967.06s]  They got I don't know what to do about this.
[5967.06s -> 5968.46s]  I don't let's keep gaming.
[5968.46s -> 5969.16s]  I think I'm all right.
[5969.16s -> 5971.36s]  If there's a pool of coffee underneath the zero on
[5971.36s -> 5974.92s]  my numpad and that's going to be a problem and this
[5974.92s -> 5976.52s]  is annoying because I like this keyboard.
[5976.52s -> 5978.62s]  My keyboard doesn't even have a numpad who uses
[5978.62s -> 5979.22s]  a numpad.
[5979.22s -> 5980.72s]  I don't want time you use your numpad.
[5980.72s -> 5982.32s]  I haven't I'm just saying that's where it is.
[5984.20s -> 5984.40s]  All right.
[5984.40s -> 5985.30s]  Well, it's no problem.
[5985.80s -> 5986.90s]  I hate looking at it though.
[5987.70s -> 5988.60s]  And then I'm low.
[5988.60s -> 5992.20s]  Now I have to go get a paper towel and turn it into
[5992.20s -> 5995.70s]  a little stick and then slide it under and let it
[5995.70s -> 5997.00s]  absorb and then pull it out.
[5997.00s -> 5999.80s]  And oh my God, what a fucking disaster.
[6000.50s -> 6001.70s]  Okay, what are we doing now?
[6005.21s -> 6005.91s]  Didn't get on the floor.
[6005.91s -> 6009.31s]  So it's our tip the keyboard.
[6009.31s -> 6010.51s]  No, it's going to get everywhere.
[6013.61s -> 6015.81s]  I'll take the keys out and clean it up later.
[6018.41s -> 6020.41s]  Yeah, I can't take all the keycaps off and clean my
[6020.41s -> 6021.21s]  keyboard right now.
[6021.21s -> 6023.61s]  We're in the middle of a game and I'm streaming with
[6023.61s -> 6028.16s]  my friend stir my hands are up and this is the one
[6028.16s -> 6032.57s]  time the one time I put like creamer in my coffee.
[6038.97s -> 6039.87s]  How is that relevant?
[6044.86s -> 6049.23s]  I am deeply like normally be like I Jeremy so bad
[6049.23s -> 6050.13s]  Jeremy bad.
[6050.87s -> 6054.79s]  Jerma you got to get some credit for like how much
[6054.79s -> 6056.39s]  extra stuff you're just dealing with.
[6056.39s -> 6057.29s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6057.29s -> 6058.59s]  Are you are you talking shit?
[6058.69s -> 6061.69s]  I know I'm saying you maybe it's time to ease up on
[6061.69s -> 6063.59s]  old German here because like I'm playing the game
[6063.59s -> 6065.49s]  and I'm doing well, but I don't I don't have coffee
[6065.49s -> 6068.69s]  in my I know like so like if I had all these extra
[6068.69s -> 6071.09s]  elements getting in the way who knows where I'd be
[6072.65s -> 6075.85s]  but here's the thing Holly just slipped a paper towel
[6075.85s -> 6076.55s]  under the door.
[6078.90s -> 6080.10s]  Hold on give me one second.
[6086.39s -> 6086.89s]  Yes.
[6087.72s -> 6089.42s]  Okay, I'm going to be good.

[6101.78s -> 6102.28s]  Wow.
[6102.28s -> 6103.18s]  This is perfect.
[6103.28s -> 6104.58s]  That's actually perfect.
[6105.50s -> 6107.50s]  I can get it under there and it's like soaking it
[6107.50s -> 6108.00s]  all up.
[6108.10s -> 6116.07s]  Look see nice.
[6116.07s -> 6117.17s]  That's actually a good idea.
[6119.76s -> 6121.16s]  Oh, let me this is a little extra here.
[6131.88s -> 6132.78s]  This is got 12.
[6135.65s -> 6135.95s]  All right.
[6135.95s -> 6136.85s]  I'll be ready in a second.
[6136.85s -> 6137.35s]  Hold on.
[6137.89s -> 6140.49s]  Yeah, no, you're you're thanks dude.
[6140.49s -> 6142.19s]  Appreciate the patience and everything.
[6143.27s -> 6144.27s]  Appreciate all your patience.
[6144.68s -> 6146.78s]  Just like my eyes like big day is really excited to play
[6146.78s -> 6148.35s]  Hell card my friend.
[6148.55s -> 6152.78s]  Yeah, this big day kind of a big day.
[6153.39s -> 6154.29s]  It's kind of a big day.
[6156.33s -> 6158.73s]  This was this is what my wife wanted for her birthday.
[6159.59s -> 6162.18s]  You're just kind of taking a mess.
[6163.90s -> 6165.10s]  I think I'm all right now.
[6167.56s -> 6171.36s]  I thought I just ended the stream by pressing like this
[6171.36s -> 6171.86s]  button.
[6174.33s -> 6175.83s]  That's as good as it's going to get for now.
[6183.31s -> 6185.61s]  You know this see this was a good choice turn-based
[6185.61s -> 6186.01s]  game.
[6188.72s -> 6189.92s]  Oh, I knocked one of the keys off.
[6190.98s -> 6191.38s]  Hey,
[6193.67s -> 6210.80s]  anybody missing a two isn't going to stink when coffee
[6210.80s -> 6211.20s]  dries.
[6211.20s -> 6213.00s]  It smells like fucking dog shit.
[6219.72s -> 6219.92s]  All right.
[6219.92s -> 6220.92s]  That's as good as it's going to get.
[6225.32s -> 6227.52s]  I just want to make sure it didn't actually get anywhere
[6227.82s -> 6229.52s]  where it's going to be actually like a real problem.
[6229.72s -> 6230.82s]  And I don't think that's the case.
[6235.71s -> 6235.91s]  I don't know.
[6235.91s -> 6237.41s]  You're always making fun of me when I tell you I take
[6237.41s -> 6238.31s]  caffeine pills.
[6239.52s -> 6242.22s]  Stop doing never never spilled them stop all over my
[6242.22s -> 6242.52s]  desk.
[6242.52s -> 6243.32s]  Stop doing that.
[6244.12s -> 6244.62s]  Stop it.
[6244.62s -> 6245.32s]  Stop doing that.
[6251.77s -> 6252.17s]  All right.
[6252.47s -> 6253.17s]  There we go.
[6254.29s -> 6256.89s]  Oh, but there's going to be a stain on my desk.
[6262.43s -> 6262.63s]  All right.
[6262.63s -> 6264.03s]  The rest can be done later.
[6265.73s -> 6266.73s]  Calm down Hector.
[6268.04s -> 6268.34s]  All right.
[6268.44s -> 6268.84s]  I'm good.
[6276.19s -> 6277.49s]  I took a lot of damage.
[6278.09s -> 6285.30s]  Yeah, you are you kill the close guy the near guy.
[6285.40s -> 6287.10s]  I can kill the near guy.
[6289.56s -> 6292.36s]  And I'm also going to kill the far away one over here
[6292.36s -> 6292.86s]  too high.
[6293.06s -> 6293.96s]  I got them.
[6294.65s -> 6295.45s]  We do got them.
[6296.34s -> 6300.87s]  My hands are very sticky and the reason why I say
[6300.87s -> 6303.67s]  this is because I usually just drink my coffee black
[6304.24s -> 6306.44s]  but I decided I'll put some hazelnut in it and then
[6306.44s -> 6307.64s]  I'll spill it all over myself.
[6307.64s -> 6308.14s]  That's smart.
[6319.04s -> 6320.14s]  I actually really like this card.
[6320.14s -> 6320.74s]  I'm going to get it again.
[6323.65s -> 6329.88s]  I've got omega aoe in the the near circle like one
[6329.88s -> 6332.28s]  when they're getting near I just kill everything.
[6333.90s -> 6335.40s]  I think we're going to be aware.
[6338.66s -> 6346.68s]  I think this is the one I'm going to heal me gets two
[6346.68s -> 6347.48s]  gemstones.
[6348.88s -> 6349.98s]  Yeah, I have that too.
[6350.82s -> 6354.90s]  That seems very good because it cost one.
[6355.00s -> 6355.10s]  Yeah.
[6355.10s -> 6356.20s]  So then I just did it for you.
[6356.20s -> 6357.10s]  Now you do it for me.
[6358.09s -> 6358.39s]  There we go.
[6358.39s -> 6360.19s]  We just both gained one gemstone for free.
[6364.36s -> 6365.46s]  You're going to heal use.
[6365.76s -> 6366.56s]  We got the heal.
[6366.76s -> 6368.06s]  I did feel like you need a heal.
[6368.16s -> 6368.66s]  I did heal.
[6371.03s -> 6372.93s]  That's oh, that's your health after healing.
[6373.23s -> 6375.43s]  It is you're at 26.
[6375.43s -> 6376.33s]  You're only forehead.
[6376.73s -> 6382.96s]  Oh, hey Trevor.
[6382.96s -> 6386.76s]  Can you play the original ET on Atari next year for my birthday?
[6386.76s -> 6387.36s]  I don't know.
[6395.63s -> 6396.63s]  Come on, do it.
[6397.23s -> 6397.83s]  You do it.
[6398.23s -> 6399.33s]  What else you got going on?
[6400.66s -> 6401.36s]  Are you going to do it?
[6401.96s -> 6406.06s]  No, I don't know that guy.
[6407.28s -> 6407.48s]  All right.
[6407.48s -> 6410.96s]  Let's actually pay attention because we got a walk that
[6410.96s -> 6412.46s]  we got that's a skill of Zerker.
[6413.43s -> 6419.02s]  I'll get that this needs to die 50 health 50 health on this
[6419.02s -> 6421.52s]  one 50 health on this one.
[6421.62s -> 6422.02s]  Okay.
[6422.02s -> 6423.02s]  What do you want to do about this?
[6427.06s -> 6431.66s]  I could I could kill I could kill this thing deals one damage.
[6431.76s -> 6437.68s]  Yeah, but I think is he a summoner he is giving strength
[6437.68s -> 6443.73s]  to all allies to every anything comes in the circle.
[6443.73s -> 6444.43s]  I can kill him.
[6446.06s -> 6448.06s]  Well, let's kill.
[6448.16s -> 6450.66s]  I'm going to kill the flying hog in the circle.
[6452.10s -> 6460.11s]  Then I'm going to give you want to give block to you and
[6460.11s -> 6461.71s]  then I'll take some block.
[6463.09s -> 6465.89s]  Does this carry over to each turn the block it does right?
[6466.94s -> 6470.88s]  No, it doesn't you've been playing this game the second
[6470.88s -> 6470.98s]  time.
[6470.98s -> 6475.88s]  We've done a run kind of a important thing to notice.
[6476.28s -> 6479.75s]  Don't you think at the start of the round your armor is
[6479.75s -> 6483.13s]  going to immediately come off a fuck you grimace.
[6487.84s -> 6489.84s]  All right, we can lay the fire.
[6490.24s -> 6491.14s]  We should be able to get rid of these.
[6495.25s -> 6499.75s]  Wait, can we I can get rid of like the half of the people
[6499.75s -> 6500.35s]  on my side.
[6504.36s -> 6504.76s]  Okay.
[6505.65s -> 6507.35s]  I can also get rid of those two as well.
[6507.35s -> 6510.32s]  It's going to hurt but I can get rid of them.
[6511.92s -> 6512.72s]  It's not going to hurt.
[6513.12s -> 6513.62s]  Yes, it is.
[6515.09s -> 6515.59s]  I know it's not.
[6515.99s -> 6516.19s]  Okay.
[6516.19s -> 6516.89s]  Now, what are you going to do?
[6517.82s -> 6529.54s]  I am going to I'm going to kill this guy and I'm going
[6529.54s -> 6530.64s]  to kill this guy.
[6530.64s -> 6532.64s]  I'm I still taking nine damage this guy.
[6533.04s -> 6533.64s]  Oh, there you go.
[6535.41s -> 6538.31s]  And then I can't do anything else with my other cards
[6538.31s -> 6539.11s]  are blocked.
[6543.33s -> 6549.19s]  Also remember you got that ice cream to keep your energy
[6549.19s -> 6549.89s]  between turns.
[6550.09s -> 6550.59s]  That's true.
[6550.59s -> 6552.79s]  You know, so like don't play too many cards there.
[6552.79s -> 6557.38s]  Bucco, I can get rid of these two in front of us.
[6557.88s -> 6559.58s]  You want to focus on the big guy.
[6568.44s -> 6571.71s]  I'm going to hold as I want to save my man.
[6576.48s -> 6580.47s]  Oh, I just got a diamond pickaxe.
[6581.07s -> 6583.43s]  Well, well, okay.
[6586.60s -> 6587.10s]  What is this?
[6587.20s -> 6588.90s]  Is he buffing himself next turn or something?
[6590.48s -> 6594.79s]  He's yeah, he's buffing.
[6595.59s -> 6596.69s]  It's growing in power.
[6596.89s -> 6598.99s]  I mean, I just smoked him.
[6599.39s -> 6600.29s]  You what are you doing?
[6603.06s -> 6604.16s]  I'm going to smoke this guy.
[6617.30s -> 6623.71s]  Smoked new card.
[6624.11s -> 6625.91s]  Your swords deal plus two damage.
[6628.03s -> 6628.73s]  I like that one.
[6630.20s -> 6632.80s]  This one's good, too, but I need to be able to get block
[6632.90s -> 6635.08s]  first, but it's definitely this one.
[6638.99s -> 6642.09s]  I'm feeling quite good about this one here.
[6642.39s -> 6643.49s]  I'm getting an artifact.
[6647.34s -> 6648.04s]  That's pretty good.
[6649.48s -> 6650.38s]  That's also really good.
[6650.38s -> 6651.18s]  I need healing.
[6652.36s -> 6653.16s]  I'm taking the blood.
[6654.93s -> 6656.03s]  Oh, yeah, get that blood.
[6656.43s -> 6659.02s]  I need healing very badly.
[6666.60s -> 6670.87s]  No, no.
[6681.81s -> 6682.21s]  What is that?
[6682.21s -> 6684.11s]  What what are you groaning about?
[6684.11s -> 6685.01s]  I'm just looking at cards.
[6685.61s -> 6686.51s]  We just moaning.
[6687.63s -> 6688.73s]  I'm just looking at cards.
[6704.70s -> 6705.60s]  Oh, that's a good one.
[6705.80s -> 6707.53s]  Okay.
[6707.63s -> 6709.23s]  Oh, I want the upgrade.
[6713.36s -> 6714.46s]  This is a stir game.
[6718.04s -> 6720.34s]  Yeah, I could see that I could see this being a stir game.
[6721.74s -> 6732.12s]  I did recommend it is my choice a lot of enemies.
[6733.56s -> 6736.16s]  Okay, but they're all like stinky pigs.
[6736.46s -> 6736.86s]  Okay.
[6737.70s -> 6740.43s]  And we got one big guy.
[6743.37s -> 6746.77s]  I can get rid of two of these or three of these actually.
[6747.17s -> 6747.57s]  Okay.
[6748.17s -> 6748.27s]  Okay.
[6748.27s -> 6749.37s]  I'm not going to do that anymore.
[6751.42s -> 6752.22s]  Hey, better not.
[6757.41s -> 6758.61s]  I can do this.
[6759.91s -> 6763.35s]  You're the big guy and not do anything else.
[6771.58s -> 6772.38s]  Talon arrow.
[6785.86s -> 6788.96s]  I'm feeling a nap creeping up a nap.
[6789.26s -> 6789.96s]  Take a nap then.
[6791.32s -> 6792.52s]  Oh, I thought you were going to take a nap.
[6792.52s -> 6793.72s]  I thought you were so bored.
[6793.72s -> 6794.82s]  You were going to know.
[6797.66s -> 6799.66s]  It's actually big because I could probably kill all these.
[6802.68s -> 6808.20s]  If you can I can they all did.
[6808.70s -> 6809.60s]  They all did.
[6810.10s -> 6810.90s]  I'm going to kill them all.
[6811.00s -> 6811.40s]  Okay.
[6811.80s -> 6812.10s]  Okay.
[6813.71s -> 6815.41s]  What the fuck your curtain is cool.
[6817.88s -> 6819.28s]  Sorry, I apologize.
[6823.52s -> 6824.32s]  That's all I got.
[6828.20s -> 6832.07s]  I might as well use it to not take any damage.
[6832.27s -> 6834.57s]  No, you shouldn't because you have ice cream.
[6835.17s -> 6836.37s]  Oh, you were taking damage.
[6836.37s -> 6837.57s]  I was going to take that you were taking damage.
[6837.57s -> 6837.87s]  Okay.
[6837.87s -> 6838.07s]  Yeah.
[6838.07s -> 6838.47s]  No, you're great.
[6838.47s -> 6838.97s]  You're great.
[6839.17s -> 6839.67s]  That's great.
[6839.67s -> 6840.27s]  You're gravy.
[6840.27s -> 6841.17s]  You're gravy, dude.
[6842.36s -> 6843.26s]  We yeah, we can kill him.
[6848.23s -> 6849.33s]  We're so good at this game.
[6849.93s -> 6851.23s]  We're incredible.
[6851.33s -> 6854.13s]  They didn't make this game no one we were going to play it.
[6864.19s -> 6864.99s]  I don't like this one.
[6865.09s -> 6868.50s]  I'll take this one black or green olives.
[6870.87s -> 6876.04s]  Green olives for the oil black olives for the topping is my
[6876.04s -> 6876.44s]  answer.
[6882.88s -> 6887.18s]  What was the question on oil olives black or green olives
[6888.25s -> 6893.59s]  never either never really?
[6894.74s -> 6895.04s]  Yeah.
[6899.18s -> 6900.08s]  Oh, that's good.
[6901.84s -> 6908.91s]  In a near range before damage in a medium radius.
[6908.91s -> 6910.91s]  I actually like that one probably more than at all.
[6911.11s -> 6912.31s]  I like the ground breaker.
[6912.41s -> 6913.41s]  It's too man of though.
[6913.41s -> 6913.91s]  That's a lot.
[6917.74s -> 6919.04s]  We got a boss coming up here.
[6919.54s -> 6922.88s]  The skeletal zorker deal five damage.
[6923.08s -> 6925.18s]  If it kills the monster increase the damage of this card
[6925.18s -> 6925.58s]  by five.
[6925.58s -> 6932.82s]  Is that permanently or just for the round drive?
[6934.47s -> 6934.87s]  I don't know.
[6935.64s -> 6936.44s]  It's permanent.
[6937.34s -> 6951.66s]  Oh, a new artifact and we off sync that now I have to do
[6951.66s -> 6953.56s]  a boss like you just did the boss.
[6953.96s -> 6954.96s]  I think that's what's happening.
[6960.80s -> 6968.78s]  But how we need to hold on.
[6974.96s -> 6978.16s]  That's a lot of that is a lot of damage a lot and I only
[6978.16s -> 6980.52s]  have one lock.
[6980.52s -> 6985.06s]  I can even do if you see what you can kill before you block
[6986.86s -> 6990.26s]  because you got four block guys are dealing three damage
[6990.76s -> 6995.66s]  and I can only do I can only do five damage total to
[6995.66s -> 6997.36s]  somebody and I can't kill anything.
[6997.96s -> 7000.66s]  I guess I could kill and deal damage to things as well.
[7000.86s -> 7002.66s]  I can kill the part of this.
[7002.76s -> 7003.16s]  All right.
[7003.56s -> 7008.14s]  Hold on.
[7008.24s -> 7008.84s]  I kill.
[7009.99s -> 7011.09s]  Why did I not do more damage?
[7014.80s -> 7016.00s]  What the fuck happened?
[7016.10s -> 7020.75s]  I well tried.
[7021.63s -> 7021.93s]  Okay.
[7021.93s -> 7024.93s]  Well now that you killed the ghoul they curse us.
[7025.33s -> 7026.03s]  I know that first.
[7026.03s -> 7028.73s]  You waited what first you you cursed you you know,
[7028.73s -> 7029.03s]  you're good.
[7029.03s -> 7029.53s]  You're good.
[7030.30s -> 7030.80s]  You're fine.
[7030.90s -> 7032.20s]  A delusion card.
[7032.20s -> 7042.95s]  You're you're delusional how much you know, we've been
[7042.95s -> 7048.96s]  here before like Doki Doki Literature Club.
[7049.69s -> 7051.69s]  You just got out of a time machine from this chat in
[7051.69s -> 7052.59s]  like 2018.
[7057.40s -> 7058.10s]  What do you want me to look at?
[7059.49s -> 7060.49s]  This is bad.
[7060.99s -> 7064.69s]  I feel like like what there's a lot of shit.
[7064.99s -> 7078.90s]  Are they going trouble weird that me as the Ranger can
[7078.90s -> 7081.20s]  only kill all of the things if they're in close range.
[7083.55s -> 7084.45s]  This hurts a lot.
[7089.90s -> 7092.10s]  Okay, your sword steel plus two damage.
[7092.70s -> 7094.00s]  This would never happen.
[7094.93s -> 7095.83s]  If you were the mage.
[7097.14s -> 7104.40s]  Yeah, I mean, okay, but hold on a second.
[7105.46s -> 7106.66s]  How the fuck are we supposed to do this?
[7107.23s -> 7110.13s]  You got to kill these big ass zombies with the 9 HP.
[7110.63s -> 7112.83s]  Okay, they're not dealing all the damage and they got
[7112.83s -> 7113.63s]  buffed a lot deal.
[7114.03s -> 7116.33s]  I can deal two damage in a medium radius.
[7117.39s -> 7118.09s]  I can do five.
[7118.09s -> 7120.59s]  Okay, I can do five damage to this guy on the right.
[7122.22s -> 7123.12s]  I can't kill it though.
[7123.12s -> 7124.72s]  So it's like a waste of me using it.
[7124.72s -> 7125.82s]  There's nobody in a cone.
[7126.12s -> 7128.72s]  Wait, no, the only thing that's in a cone is this one.
[7132.94s -> 7135.14s]  How much damage can you do to the guy on the right?
[7139.30s -> 7140.10s]  Talk to me.
[7142.74s -> 7146.24s]  These big zombies the big ghoulies the green guys are
[7146.24s -> 7147.34s]  hitting both of us.
[7147.34s -> 7149.64s]  That's why we're both taking time about damage these
[7149.64s -> 7150.14s]  guys here.
[7150.68s -> 7151.48s]  Yeah, okay.
[7151.48s -> 7153.78s]  Yeah, but so how much damage can you do to one of them
[7153.78s -> 7154.08s]  right now?
[7155.00s -> 7167.72s]  I can do I need to I can I can kill this one.
[7168.68s -> 7168.78s]  Wait.
[7168.78s -> 7169.38s]  No, I can't.
[7171.68s -> 7173.48s]  Can you hit that guy one more time?
[7174.54s -> 7178.30s]  I can but because I can kill that one if you could do
[7178.30s -> 7179.20s]  one more damage to it.
[7186.87s -> 7188.87s]  Okay, we still both take like 20 damage.
[7192.22s -> 7194.92s]  I did some major miscalculating.
[7195.66s -> 7199.80s]  Yeah, I think I'm dead.
[7200.62s -> 7201.32s]  You dead.
[7201.42s -> 7202.42s]  Oh, you are dead.
[7202.42s -> 7202.92s]  You're dead.
[7202.92s -> 7204.72s]  You die right now.
[7208.02s -> 7208.62s]  What?
[7209.71s -> 7213.55s]  Yeah, I don't I mean, I think it's that we didn't know
[7213.55s -> 7216.27s]  these things hit both of us as well.
[7216.27s -> 7218.37s]  Like you focused all your damage the first turn on the
[7218.37s -> 7221.27s]  thing that cursed you when these guys are double hitting
[7221.27s -> 7224.17s]  us and they're getting the damage this this arena is
[7224.27s -> 7226.57s]  crazy because he's buffing their damage every turn.
[7227.72s -> 7229.02s]  Oh shit.
[7229.76s -> 7230.86s]  Death is not the end.
[7231.16s -> 7231.66s]  Hold on.
[7242.31s -> 7256.81s]  Let's go get apparently they don't have to attack every
[7256.81s -> 7257.11s]  turn.
[7257.11s -> 7257.81s]  They just were.
[7258.51s -> 7265.93s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[7271.08s -> 7272.38s]  I guess I could kill.
[7274.85s -> 7277.35s]  Who's attacking you nine damage.
[7279.18s -> 7281.12s]  I could do five.
[7281.22s -> 7282.82s]  No, I could do eight.
[7284.55s -> 7285.05s]  You're dead.
[7285.72s -> 7286.12s]  Hold on.
[7286.12s -> 7286.52s]  I don't know.
[7286.52s -> 7287.12s]  I don't think I am.
[7287.72s -> 7288.62s]  You're dead there buster.
[7288.82s -> 7289.32s]  Are you sure?
[7289.32s -> 7289.92s]  I don't think I'm dead.
[7291.62s -> 7292.72s]  Kind of dead there buster.
[7301.73s -> 7311.28s]  I'm oh wide one fucking health shit.
[7313.13s -> 7313.43s]  All right.
[7313.43s -> 7314.03s]  This gets hard.
[7314.33s -> 7316.53s]  This game is pretty pretty intense.
[7318.56s -> 7322.50s]  I think you also got to consider when we're choosing
[7323.63s -> 7324.83s]  the vaults and stuff.
[7327.94s -> 7331.74s]  What other enemies were making but I'm confused at why
[7331.74s -> 7333.44s]  we had to fight two bosses in a row.
[7334.95s -> 7336.15s]  Do you think this game is cute?
[7336.55s -> 7339.64s]  I think it's good.
[7339.84s -> 7346.48s]  I think it's fun, but I am going to suggest we play
[7346.48s -> 7350.04s]  that other one which other one the one the one you
[7350.04s -> 7351.85s]  liked the one I liked.
[7351.85s -> 7352.15s]  Okay.
[7352.15s -> 7353.45s]  I feel like that's gonna be very fun.
[7356.68s -> 7357.68s]  We played like two hours.
[7357.98s -> 7358.78s]  I think we can pivot.
[7359.56s -> 7359.96s]  Okay.
[7360.06s -> 7360.76s]  No, I'm fine with that.
[7362.86s -> 7363.56s]  I like the concept.
[7363.56s -> 7364.26s]  I think it's really fun.
[7365.52s -> 7366.62s]  Yeah, I'm probably gonna play more of that.
[7367.02s -> 7368.92s]  This is a stir game if you by the way, if you want to
