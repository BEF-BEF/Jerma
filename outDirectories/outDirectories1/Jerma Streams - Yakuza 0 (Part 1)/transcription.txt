[1.53s -> 21.64s]  Hello. Hi, everybody. Oh, it's muted Marty. Muted Marty. No, I'm here. I'm ready to play a video
[21.64s -> 27.06s]  game called Yakuza Zero. And I'll give you a couple of quick things before we get started.
[27.70s -> 31.54s]  Reason why I wasn't live yesterday is because I want to be completely transparent with everybody.
[32.90s -> 37.94s]  I've started getting a little bit of cold symptoms, congestion in the nose, you probably hear it.
[38.66s -> 43.38s]  Uh, so I've taken a little bit of time off just over the last couple of days,
[43.38s -> 47.30s]  started getting a little bit of symptoms on Saturday. I have taken a COVID test.
[48.02s -> 52.98s]  So just kind of waiting to see what that says. I've been isolating. I haven't gone anywhere,
[52.98s -> 57.22s]  I haven't done anything. So I'm just gonna, I'm taking precautions here to make sure that,
[57.22s -> 64.74s]  you know, just in case. If I do, then I'll have to just kind of, I'll try to get through it,
[64.74s -> 74.74s]  you know, I'll get through it. But I don't think that's what it is. Because I've seen,
[74.74s -> 78.98s]  you know, how does COVID start, you know, that doesn't typically starts in the chest, but
[79.78s -> 84.18s]  who knows? I'm just trying to be completely cautious. I don't I want to be totally,
[84.18s -> 96.87s]  totally, totally safe with this, right? Can you smell? Yes, I can. I can smell, I can taste.
[97.51s -> 105.19s]  I just am stuffy and a little congested. And it's been like that for the last like,
[105.19s -> 109.19s]  probably four, three or four days. Hasn't really gone any further than that. Don't have a fever.
[113.53s -> 125.78s]  We know you smell. You're a baby with a head cold. But I just want to be clear,
[125.78s -> 128.58s]  if people are like hearing something in my voice and they're like, wait a minute,
[128.58s -> 133.62s]  what the fuck is going on here, Jerma? I want you to know that I'm already kind of on top of it. So
[134.87s -> 150.15s]  already on top of it. He's got a new mic. If you do have it go into it with the mindset,
[150.15s -> 155.45s]  you'll get through it no matter what. Yeah. I've been taking vitamins too. I've been taking
[155.45s -> 162.49s]  vitamin D. I've been drinking like some vitamin supplemental drinks. My immune system is pretty
[162.49s -> 177.72s]  good. But I'm we'll see, right? I'll know soon. What is vitamin two? What did I say vitamin two?
[178.52s -> 191.43s]  I didn't I said vitamin D. I said vitamin two. No, I didn't. Yeah, I'm taking precautions,
[191.43s -> 196.47s]  you know, I'm taking vitamin two. I don't know. Did I do that? Well, that's weird if I did.
[196.47s -> 201.19s]  Anyways, let's play Yakuza Zero. It's funny that the title of this stream is I promise I will not
[201.19s -> 207.43s]  quit this game after three hours like I did last time. I played this before on stream a few years
[207.43s -> 213.56s]  ago. I stopped playing after three hours. And now I mean, I'm a little under the weather. We'll see
[213.56s -> 219.64s]  if I get to three hours. We'll see what happens after three hours. But I'll come back to it. No,
[219.64s -> 223.48s]  I'm no I'm playing this for more than three hours. I promise it's already in the title. It
[223.48s -> 239.46s]  has to be there. And by the way, there was a bet in pre stream chat too. Let me get this up. Hold
[239.46s -> 251.34s]  on. It was a pre stream bet that I won. It was it will I will I start the stream before 3pm? And
[251.34s -> 260.33s]  the answer is yes. If I didn't start before three, I was gonna have to add 100 billion dollars onto
[260.33s -> 269.48s]  the debt. So I gave myself a lot of incentive. How's the audio for you guys? Can you hear it?
[269.48s -> 284.23s]  Is it good? A little bit louder? Oh, did I make a tweet? No, I didn't. I didn't even make a tweet
[284.23s -> 298.12s]  about this. How about Yakuza guaranteed stream? No, I'm already playing it. How about just Yakuza?
[299.02s -> 305.54s]  Here we go. Yakuza. I don't care. Yakuza. And people won't know which one. So they'll be like,
[305.54s -> 310.39s]  I'm curious. Is he playing the new one? And they'll come in and inflate my view count.
[311.11s -> 324.97s]  twitch.tv slash germa985. That's my name, right? Yeah. All right, I'm gonna give this a real shot.
[325.61s -> 339.46s]  Let's go. New game. I don't recommend it for players who are skilled at action games.
[339.46s -> 349.86s]  This is the but I don't care. No, not flying on hard. Not flying on hard. He's never gonna finish
[349.86s -> 353.86s]  this omega lol. Hey, I didn't say I was ever gonna finish it. I said I was gonna play it for more
[353.86s -> 360.89s]  than three hours. Play hard for 10 million off. No, that's not enough. Normal. I don't care.
[361.61s -> 370.90s]  You had an opportunity right there. That one guy was like, Oh, if that was like 150 million,
[370.90s -> 381.14s]  I would have done it. It was your opportunity. Okay, here's a fun experiment. Those of you that
[381.14s -> 384.50s]  watched the other stream that have access to it, I think it's only the archive channel, right?
[385.51s -> 396.25s]  Let's see how close this is to the other stream. Play them side by side. I'm gonna make the same
[396.25s -> 405.58s]  references. No, I'm gonna try to make completely different references. All right, what would I
[405.58s -> 425.00s]  have said right here? Hi. Nice shoes, man. I'm trying to be different. You're trying hard now.
[425.00s -> 428.92s]  Fuck, I'm gonna be trying so hard to make like things I wouldn't have made a reference to
[429.64s -> 451.56s]  be different. It's when he said chat raid forced Mr. Stark to play Nancy Drew. Nice.
[452.66s -> 471.13s]  Oh, and he did it. That's great. Actually true. He did it. That's awesome. Oh, no, you guys. You
[471.13s -> 497.46s]  guys now have a new Drew Crew streamer. December 9 1988 in Tokyo. This game about. Oh, the Yakuza,
[497.46s -> 507.08s]  right? No, Jeremy, it's about like growing up as a doctor.
[508.04s -> 541.11s]  It's a dentist simulator. Did people recognize me? Oh, I've got what did I say here? I said
[541.11s -> 547.96s]  something here. I remember this. I think I said like, oh, sorry, I messily ate a hamburger or
[547.96s -> 555.74s]  something, right? Oh, that was a really good double cheeseburger with extra ketchup. Run it back. Is
[555.74s -> 572.14s]  that what I said? You said french fries. All right. No, stop telling me what I said. I don't. I'm
[572.22s -> 595.26s]  going to just be me. You said cheeseburger from Burger King. Fuck. Here's something that I didn't
[595.26s -> 608.82s]  know. They drive on the other side of the road in Japan. I did not know that. Is the United States,
[608.82s -> 613.06s]  is the USA the only place that drives on the left side of the road? I mean, on the right side of
[613.06s -> 622.26s]  that. Wait, hold on. We're the only country on earth that I think is one of the country that
[622.26s -> 640.36s]  does that that drives on the right side. Arts of Africa do too. Less countries drive on the left.
[640.36s -> 652.94s]  Oh, at what point in this game do I go?
[675.91s -> 679.91s]  That was in 30 minutes.
[687.93s -> 694.84s]  I got a loan.
[701.19s -> 704.63s]  I got a loan. All right. I'm paying attention. Leave me alone.
[709.34s -> 713.58s]  I saw the word loan and my character was on the screen. So I was like, I have loan.
[715.50s -> 717.10s]  All right. Come work for me. Loan shark.
[722.44s -> 724.36s]  A lot easier than that Yakuza payroll.
[743.98s -> 745.74s]  By the way, I have to say,
[748.70s -> 753.02s]  what have you ever stopped and looked over your right shoulder while you were talking to someone?
[756.81s -> 757.69s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[779.29s -> 784.50s]  See you around. I think that would be kind of weird.
[786.90s -> 790.50s]  You just have to tilt a few more degrees and you and I are talking normally.
[799.43s -> 809.43s]  All right. Here we go. I mean, well, I meant like here comes the music.
[819.58s -> 830.73s]  Can you dance in this game? I swear to God, every TV movie and every show, every anime,
[830.73s -> 834.65s]  no one ever smokes a cigarette. It's lit in their mouth and that's it. And then you don't see it
[834.65s -> 841.91s]  again. Okay. Where's the cigarette? Where is it? He had it. It takes like 10 minutes to smoke
[841.91s -> 853.14s]  a cigarette. Where is it? Let's see. Nope. Nope. No, no. He had a lit cigarette. The tip was lit.
[853.94s -> 870.38s]  Oh, there we go. Tip. That's a full cigarette back there in the background.
[871.10s -> 890.97s]  Smoking is hard to animate. Come on. Have a lit cigarette. Have one, a lit cigarette with just
[890.97s -> 901.48s]  one puff out of it. Come on. Fuck. Doing the same jokes. Is that the same one? No, it's not. Show me.
[901.48s -> 924.70s]  That's not the same joke. Show me. Prove it. It can't be. No, it's not. This is where Nishiki said
[924.70s -> 931.83s]  to meet up me. I guess beat. I, Oh my God. Said he'd meet me. Guess I beat him here.
[934.87s -> 941.99s]  724106. Huh? That's code four. What you up to? I'm waiting for your slow ass to show up. Is this
[941.99s -> 952.58s]  when like twitch emotes become absolute language? May as well have a look around and see if I can
[952.58s -> 965.51s]  find him. Okay. Let's meet him. Find Nishikiyama. Welcome. Oh, this is a save point. Can I save it?
[969.59s -> 981.10s]  There's a big S. Oh, you can save the game. Use the, and use the item box. And you save.
[981.74s -> 992.39s]  Million yen vending machine. How much yen do I have? It's a dream machine. Insert a million yen
[992.39s -> 999.45s]  to make your dreams come true. Maybe. I don't have enough money. I don't have that much. Oh,
[999.45s -> 1012.28s]  well, whatever. Is there a sprint? I'm gonna take a second. I'm gonna just take a quick second.
[1012.28s -> 1017.37s]  Okay. All right, let's go. Like I'm already like running.
[1018.01s -> 1021.08s]  Wow. While running. Is there a run button?
[1034.62s -> 1041.50s]  Let's get in there. Somebody help me, please. Running shakedowns on our turf. Somebody needs
[1041.50s -> 1054.76s]  to set them straight before they try anything really stupid. What do you want? This ain't a show.
[1055.40s -> 1065.51s]  Oh, it's not. Wait, are you sure he's not Yakuza? So what if he is? He's our age. If he's Yakuza,
[1065.51s -> 1075.05s]  he's probably just an errand boy. Wait, let me do this accurately. It'd be a lot lower than this.
[1075.77s -> 1086.62s]  And what if we are? My family runs this part of Kamurocho. If you were regulars, you'd know
[1086.62s -> 1095.58s]  better than to do anything stupid here. Excuse you? Where's a piece of Yakuza trash? Get off
[1095.58s -> 1102.26s]  lecturing us. Yeah, that's more accurate. You can still kind of hear it a little bit.
[1104.90s -> 1116.33s]  All right, let's go. No music. What? I remember the fighting in this game was really fun.
[1117.13s -> 1124.92s]  It has a really good combat system is what I remember. Holy shit, that guy's annihilated.
[1127.54s -> 1133.38s]  Press Y during an X combo to perform a finishing blow. No music? What are you talking about?
[1133.38s -> 1141.14s]  Turn up the music. I turned down the music because it's loud. Please, we can't hear it. Hold on.
[1144.26s -> 1149.67s]  Is it broken? Yeah, finishing blow knocks me down. The knockdown effect varies depending on
[1149.67s -> 1155.72s]  the number of times X is pressed. What are you guys on about? Wait, are you mad because it sounds
[1155.72s -> 1165.37s]  like it's coming through a wall? Oh shit, it is. It's like muffled coming through a wall.
[1167.56s -> 1180.15s]  What the fuck is going on? What? This is insane. Why do they have a setting where it's like you're
[1180.15s -> 1198.15s]  not at the party, but your neighbor is annoying? Okay. All right. I get it. I get it. Does that
[1198.15s -> 1207.74s]  just in the menu? All right, here you go. This is your music. This is a finishing blow. One, two,
[1207.74s -> 1219.26s]  three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. The yellow gauge on the top is to use your health.
[1219.26s -> 1222.30s]  The game will end if the yellow part is fully depleted, so keep an eye on your health at all
[1222.30s -> 1227.26s]  times. Yep. If the gauge flashes red, it means you're in a very bad shape and you should
[1227.26s -> 1232.54s]  replenish your health immediately. Use a health recovery snack or eat something. Yeah, okay.
[1233.26s -> 1238.82s]  Press B to grab someone. If an enemy is guarding to block your attacks, grab them and then attack
[1238.82s -> 1249.85s]  to deal damage. Hold on. This guy, why does that guy have rage mode? All right, come here.
[1256.65s -> 1262.60s]  One punch in the face. That's like WWF style. You're just letting me punch you in the face
[1262.60s -> 1270.95s]  as hard as I can. I'm turning that down. It's a little loud. Your training is now complete.
[1270.95s -> 1281.30s]  It's time to wipe the smirks off their faces. Let's go. Grab this guy. Punch him right down
[1281.30s -> 1292.12s]  his throat. Grab this guy. Punch him right down his throat. It's a bug. Wait, what? It's an actual
[1292.12s -> 1315.90s]  bug in the game? You need to put it in stereo. Wait, what is going on? Like that? Okay, I did it.
[1315.90s -> 1341.58s]  It's an in-game engine problem. Oh, well, it's all right. 2900. It sounds worse. What is wrong
[1341.58s -> 1345.26s]  with the audio? I'm trying to please put the volume in max.
[1361.35s -> 1364.55s]  Restart the game? Well, let me save it first. Hold on.
[1364.55s -> 1374.10s]  I like that suit.
[1387.46s -> 1399.40s]  The Joker? It's not the Joker. Hey, this came out before the Joker did.
[1400.36s -> 1401.08s]  The new movie.
[1417.48s -> 1423.00s]  Joker's been around for 80 years. Yeah, but not the new movie that came out like a year ago.
[1434.44s -> 1455.50s]  I should put Kazama-san's mind at rest. I don't know about that. He always knew all I could do was
[1455.50s -> 1462.30s]  fight. The other one was good at the dance. Different categories. Was it with dancers, fighters?
[1462.30s -> 1472.65s]  I'm just reading. I can't read it. Why can't I read this?
[1476.49s -> 1480.25s]  Do I have to sit back in my chair and smoke my half-lit cigarette for four hours?
[1495.24s -> 1495.96s]  500 grand.
[1502.30s -> 1505.18s]  Kazama's father is always in plain clothes.
[1505.18s -> 1506.70s]  Passion? Cool.
[1512.38s -> 1515.66s]  Oh, you fight this guy. Spoilers for the other stream I did.
[1524.15s -> 1524.47s]  Do it.
[1534.39s -> 1553.37s]  Signed her jacket. It's a nice jacket. Cigarettes gone, by the way. Cigarettes gone.
[1556.01s -> 1556.33s]  I win.
[1556.33s -> 1567.13s]  He ate it.
[1577.14s -> 1579.30s]  I like the way it burns when it goes down my throat.
[1591.74s -> 1602.38s]  Hey, let's go. So what do you guys want me to do? I always hate matching speed in games like this.
[1603.18s -> 1606.46s]  Because you always just look like a weird guy that just can't keep up with his friend like,
[1606.46s -> 1620.46s]  oh, shit, sorry. I have to tilt this thing. The way these two are interacting. This is just like
[1620.46s -> 1627.30s]  two drunk guys on the street. This is how they interact. Oh, sorry. Where do you want to go?
[1627.30s -> 1634.12s]  What's still open? That place is open. I don't want to go there, though. This place sucks.
[1634.36s -> 1641.05s]  Let's do one more. We can just walk to the hotel.
[1658.01s -> 1661.77s]  Same joke. I can't wait to get three hours into this stream,
[1661.77s -> 1666.41s]  so I cannot be told I'm doing the same shit. We will cross that threshold,
[1666.41s -> 1688.89s]  and I can't possibly do the same thing. We only have three hours of material. No.
[1691.16s -> 1706.36s]  All right, let's go. Let's do it. Let's have some fun. You got a Trojan condom ad?
[1707.32s -> 1711.59s]  Oh, aren't they targeted ads? Oh, I don't know what you're doing.
[1729.30s -> 1736.36s]  Max out the in-game volume? Okay, I will. All right, it's a fight. Oh, this is two drunk guys.
[1736.36s -> 1750.39s]  Oh, I remember this. Yep. Okay, avoid exact same thing. Hey, old man, quit talking to those.
[1750.39s -> 1758.06s]  We're not done here. Who's an old man? You snot-nosed little punk. Who's a snot? Whatever you said.
[1758.78s -> 1774.55s]  Oh, shit, he just did the fucking Pac-Man technique. Now you've done it. Screw it.
[1774.55s -> 1777.43s]  They're completely wasted. It's not worth the trouble. Let's take a different road.
[1777.43s -> 1783.32s]  I got a faster way to fix this. Oh, yeah, I just need to sober them up a bit with my fists.
[1791.22s -> 1803.40s]  Again, I can't tell if you're a sadist or a charity worker. No, well, you sweep the leg,
[1803.40s -> 1807.56s]  give them a blanket. Sweep the leg, give them a blanket, and put them in a safe place.
[1821.06s -> 1827.42s]  Brunkards. All right, heat gauge. Three blue glowing bars on the top left are called the heat
[1827.42s -> 1832.78s]  gauge. The heat gauge starts at first bar, and as your attacks hit enemies, the gauge fills up,
[1832.78s -> 1837.34s]  shifting to the second and then third bar. At each level, your speed increases, some moves
[1837.34s -> 1842.62s]  and require a certain level of heat. So once you are used to fighting, keep an eye on your heat
[1842.62s -> 1847.64s]  level. Once the heat gauge shifts to the second or third bar, Kiryu's body begins to glow with a
[1847.64s -> 1852.52s]  little aura. This is called heat mode, and it signals that you can use a special heat action.
[1853.16s -> 1862.10s]  Try using heat actions while sobering up the drunkards. What's this? It's CBD pen on stream
[1862.10s -> 1869.83s]  for 500 million off the debt. I don't smoke. I don't smoke. No, that's impossible. I don't
[1869.83s -> 1878.04s]  have a CBD pen. Okay. All right, press B with the heat gauge at the second or third bar to grab
[1878.04s -> 1892.42s]  enemies and then press Y. It's a super punch. That hurts you too. That guy won. How much heat
[1892.42s -> 1904.30s]  does this guy have? Okay, your training is now complete. That concludes the explanation of the
[1904.30s -> 1909.26s]  heat gauge and special moves, but the two drunkards still need some sobriety beaten into them.
[1910.06s -> 1914.46s]  If you take if you take a fighting stance using RB movement with the left stick will center around
[1914.46s -> 1918.14s]  the enemy in front of you. This is very effective when you want to focus your attacks on a single
[1918.14s -> 1952.84s]  enemy like this guy. Use RB and RB to lock RB to lock onto an enemy. Why do that when you just do
[1952.84s -> 1973.62s]  that? Right bumper. What I think I changed. I changed it. Didn't I? Losing to the drunk guys.
[1974.18s -> 1979.45s]  No, I have too much health to lose to the drunk guys. It's impossible. Deal update. No,
[1980.26s -> 1993.59s]  I'm not taking any drugs right now. Okay. I'm sorry. It's not drug related. It better not be.
[1993.59s -> 2001.91s]  If it is, I'm if this is drug related, I'm taking 100 million off the debt. Okay. New deal. All
[2001.91s -> 2006.44s]  money collected in Yakuza by the end of the stream will go towards paying off the debt.
[2006.44s -> 2024.39s]  Notice yen to USD conversion will apply all money collected. All right. That sounds pretty good.
[2024.39s -> 2028.71s]  So all money that so all money collected are all money that I have in my bank account by the end
[2028.71s -> 2041.77s]  of the stream. Wait with conversion, wouldn't that? Okay. Collected. End of the game. Whatever.
[2045.14s -> 2050.79s]  Okay, Mr. Hero, I'll walk you to the train. Take it slow. Oh, thanks. You're awful considerate
[2050.79s -> 2065.94s]  for a kid your age. All's well that ends well. One USD is 100 yen. Okay. Completing certain
[2065.94s -> 2071.46s]  challenges for your CP completion points. You can view them for the pause menu under completion
[2071.46s -> 2075.38s]  list. Some of the some of the things. Some are things that will probably happen on their own
[2075.38s -> 2081.08s]  as you play the game. But yeah, all right. Exchanging CP visit temples or shrines to
[2081.08s -> 2087.99s]  access the CP exchange menu where you can spend CP to earn special blessings ranging from being
[2087.99s -> 2100.98s]  able to sprint for longer distances or to earning more cash from fights. Okay, cool. What a waste.
[2100.98s -> 2112.73s]  A damn shame I say. So just out of curiosity. It's been like this game kind of slow start.
[2112.73s -> 2118.26s]  It's been 40 minutes and I've kind of barely just started doing stuff. How did I play this game for
[2118.26s -> 2127.02s]  like three hours and stop? I don't understand. What did I say? What? Why did I say? Oh, I'm done.
[2127.02s -> 2141.91s]  It's because I was just super like ADHD and I couldn't even handle it. Oh, okay. Yeah. You
[2141.91s -> 2146.87s]  want to talk alcohol. You're like taking one swig from a vintage bottle and tossing the rest.
[2147.51s -> 2158.38s]  Going from the look of you. You're Japanese mafia. Yeah. Hey, something like that. Yes. Seems like
[2158.38s -> 2165.10s]  you're pretty confident in a fight. A real dynamite boy. Calling me boy. Ha ha. Don't get ruffled
[2165.10s -> 2171.18s]  now kid. Compared to me, you're practically a toddler. Hey, hear you. What's the hold up, man?
[2171.18s -> 2177.91s]  It's nothing. Be right there. No sense wasting time with this drunk. Let's just go. Too much
[2177.91s -> 2184.87s]  booze is bad for you gramps. Take care. Hey, now hold up. Wait, I got one piece of advice for you
[2184.87s -> 2190.17s]  and I've got a friend waiting for me. If you got something to say, make it quick. Oh,
[2190.97s -> 2195.59s]  out for a night with your main dog? Me and the boys used to really wreck it back when I was your
[2195.59s -> 2200.95s]  age. But if you spend all your money playing around, you'll never get stronger. You got to
[2200.95s -> 2207.37s]  invest in yourself. What? Like a gym membership? No, no, no, no, no, no. That's no better than
[2207.37s -> 2213.88s]  spending it on booze. I'm talking about investing in yourself literally. Literally? What's that even
[2213.88s -> 2224.47s]  mean? Glad you asked, my boy. Here's a special lecture just for you. Upgrades are now available.
[2224.47s -> 2238.01s]  Cool. It's like Path of Exile. I have 232,000 yen. So what do I do first? Throw your entire body
[2238.01s -> 2248.74s]  behind a vicious kick. Cool. Max health. Heat gauge will slowly rise over time when you are wounded.
[2248.74s -> 2271.51s]  However, it will only fill up to the second bar. Okay. Two million? What is it? Yen what?
[2271.51s -> 2283.96s]  Sick. Okay, so the heat gauge just slowly rises when I'm taking when I'm hurt. Pretty sick. Hey,
[2283.96s -> 2289.45s]  spend money to make money. That's right. You got to spend money to make money. 200,000?
[2289.45s -> 2297.90s]  Oh, I'm considered a brawler. You keep pouring money into yourself with a little training. That
[2297.90s -> 2303.74s]  talent of yours will grow in no time. So keep the women in wine on a budget, you hear? Ah,
[2303.74s -> 2309.69s]  investing in myself, literally. Never thought of that. Yeah, I bet you're glad you stopped and
[2309.69s -> 2318.25s]  listened down, aren't you? Yeah, I guess I am. Yo, Kiryu. I'm coming. Oh, that serious talk killed my
[2318.25s -> 2326.78s]  buds. Time for round two. You have a good night, my boy. Is Blackjack in this game?
[2329.91s -> 2335.34s]  Whatever. I don't care anymore. What a weird old man. What's his deal?
[2336.06s -> 2355.45s]  A nice Irish Japanese guy. Well, it said foreigner, didn't it? Oh, yeah, it did say foreigner. Yeah.
[2355.45s -> 2368.46s]  Bacchus isn't Japanese. No, he's the god of wine.
[2386.58s -> 2393.30s]  Bacchus is, Bacchus is Greek, yeah. I know my Greek gods. I know when I hover over him in spite
[2393.30s -> 2399.06s]  and I select him, he goes, Bacchus. I know his name. He's a big fat guy and he's a big turkey leg.
[2406.89s -> 2407.53s]  It's Roman.
[2407.53s -> 2415.00s]  Hi, guys.
[2421.38s -> 2428.15s]  College girl slash hostess. Madoka-chan and Yui-chan. Hey, one dimensional gamer,
[2428.15s -> 2432.81s]  thanks for the den. Thanks a lot.
[2433.37s -> 2451.05s]  Well, I want to.
[2454.68s -> 2463.80s]  Don't be like that. Here, pick a card, any card. How's money? I thought I was doing like a cool
[2463.80s -> 2484.63s]  magic trick. Why don't you get so popular with the ladies? Wait, don't tell me you think I
[2484.63s -> 2491.53s]  just let those two play me for 40 grand. Oh, wait, that's, hold on. Who's this?
[2499.83s -> 2504.07s]  Okay, if you gave 40 grand to just two random girls that were like, hey, maybe this is the club.
[2504.07s -> 2511.58s]  I think you kind of did. You think I just gave two people $40,000 to have fun? Whatever.
[2513.34s -> 2529.61s]  I know it's 400, but if it wasn't, this dude's rich as fuck.
[2529.61s -> 2544.97s]  I remember when they used to have the two slots in the front for the audio video cables
[2546.23s -> 2549.51s]  and it would trail all the way to where your console was and someone would just trip over
[2549.51s -> 2553.11s]  and rip the fucking cables out and just ruin your Super Mario session.
[2557.67s -> 2561.99s]  It would be like, dad, you would trip and he'd be like, he'd get caught up and go, god damn it.
[2570.01s -> 2594.15s]  This is completely unrelated somehow, but it's made me think. One of my friends rented
[2595.11s -> 2602.39s]  Rugrats from Blockbuster one time and he hated it so much. It was such a shitty game
[2602.39s -> 2608.79s]  that he threw it down his stairs and destroyed it and they had to like pay for it from Blockbuster.
[2618.06s -> 2619.82s]  How old was he? I don't know, like 12.
[2619.82s -> 2636.62s]  The search for Reptar sucks.
[2646.18s -> 2651.38s]  I remember he had a really long staircase, like a very long straight down stairwell.
[2651.38s -> 2653.94s]  So this thing just sunk into the well. It was just like
[2661.32s -> 2673.70s]  a CD, right? Yeah, it was like PlayStation 1.
[2681.48s -> 2695.88s]  Maybe it was N64. It was one of the two. Rugrats was PS1. Yeah,
[2696.44s -> 2699.32s]  I like scratched up. It didn't work anymore.
[2700.12s -> 2711.02s]  Karaoke is a rhythm game where you press buttons shown on the screen with the song.
[2711.02s -> 2716.04s]  Yeah, make sure to press the correct buttons the right time.
[2717.88s -> 2721.56s]  When someone else sings, you can support them with interjections. Remember this.
[2722.44s -> 2731.21s]  You can choose simple or lively interjections. Sing along, tambourine, maracas. I remember this.
[2731.21s -> 2741.34s]  Yep, I do. Yeah, let's go. Oh wait, somebody's done. I have to fix the audio, don't I?
[2742.44s -> 2760.12s]  Judgment. I'm going to sing Judgment. Let me turn it up. Is this a meme song?
[2761.00s -> 2772.10s]  Oh my god, what is this? Fuck, it's not. I'm sorry.
[2777.29s -> 2780.65s]  I don't know the controls. I don't know the buttons. I swear to god.
[2781.21s -> 2785.53s]  I have to look down at it sometimes. I don't. Xbox and shit. I'm serious.
[2789.38s -> 2810.82s]  I memorize PlayStation, not Xbox. Is anybody else? Anybody else?
[2824.65s -> 2842.42s]  Oh, I could kill that. Hold on. I got so into that part. I couldn't sing the rest of it.
[2854.70s -> 2862.44s]  Nice, nice, nice, nice. Yeah, X on Xbox versus X on PlayStation. It just messes up my brain.
[2864.25s -> 2868.57s]  So I have in my mind have burned the PlayStation controller into my brain.
[2869.29s -> 2884.04s]  So if I see X pop up on Xbox, it's like, oh no, wrong. I got 87. That's fine.
[2884.76s -> 2899.00s]  Entertain yourself 10 times. Just burn your Xbox brain. You want me to burn my brain?
[2912.14s -> 2924.62s]  Let me try to do that fix that people are saying.
[2927.90s -> 2933.67s]  I can plant it in that drink.
[2951.16s -> 2965.86s]  English. If I change from Japanese to English at this point, I'm going to be attacked.
[2969.00s -> 2973.37s]  All right, let me see if I can get this right. So you guys were saying
[2974.78s -> 2985.72s]  turn the background volume all the way up. Okay. And then
[2986.60s -> 2999.53s]  it's kind of loud from the master all the way up and both all the way up.
[3004.23s -> 3006.39s]  What the fuck? Why is it like a waterfall?
[3013.13s -> 3014.57s]  Now this is wicked loud.
[3018.82s -> 3019.70s]  Oh, okay. So
[3019.70s -> 3028.26s]  I turn it down in the mixer.
[3033.85s -> 3039.94s]  Okay, I'm turning it down in the mixer and that should be good.
[3047.67s -> 3048.15s]  Get off me.
[3058.02s -> 3059.62s]  Why does it sound like we're at a water park?
[3062.86s -> 3065.58s]  This is just the sounds you hear when you're standing in the line.
[3069.50s -> 3070.06s]  Get off me.
[3076.22s -> 3079.82s]  Quit doing that like Naruto move where it like splits into two people.
[3080.70s -> 3104.36s]  Why can't you have normal audio? I didn't do anything. What did I do wrong?
[3104.36s -> 3106.04s]  I didn't do anything wrong. I'm sorry.
[3108.12s -> 3110.44s]  I turned the volume down and everybody got mad at me.
[3121.61s -> 3125.05s]  A lot of the young males are severely beaten in a quiet corner of Kamurocho.
[3133.61s -> 3135.61s]  You know what's happening so far? Yes.
[3148.42s -> 3150.42s]  Yep, we got we got cigarettes.
[3165.11s -> 3168.23s]  Two just a couple of cigarettes freshly lit.
[3174.78s -> 3180.54s]  I thought he was holding a cigarette too for a second. I don't know why.
[3210.34s -> 3216.20s]  Oh shit. That's the guy. That's the guy that from the beginning. Yep.
[3216.68s -> 3243.86s]  Why'd you do that? There's too many lit cigarettes in here. The fire alarm's going off.
[3243.86s -> 3249.46s]  Fellas, can you put them down? And like 30 people in the restaurant look over with the
[3249.46s -> 3252.42s]  lit cigarettes like, oh, yes. Oh, oh, sorry.
[3277.00s -> 3311.88s]  I'm doing the thing where
[3311.88s -> 3316.20s]  somebody that you're watching a movie with has their eyes down on their phone almost the whole
[3316.20s -> 3326.12s]  time. And they just say, oh, fuck. What? Because they're humoring you because you're the one that
[3326.12s -> 3335.78s]  picked the movie. And they murdered him. Murder. What the fuck, dude? I'm just texting my mom.
[3344.58s -> 3369.35s]  How did I not make it three hours? I must have just so badly wanted to leave the game last time.
[3369.35s -> 3395.54s]  Why? Because Ubisoft games are bad. Isn't this a Sega game? This isn't Ubisoft.
[3396.02s -> 3412.41s]  I've got to call the Jima family HQ. This should be a payphone. Find a payphone. Save. Save it.
[3412.97s -> 3429.83s]  Is this, is this in the trash? Where's the save? What? Oh, bro. I look, I'm just looking at the
[3429.83s -> 3440.57s]  minimap. A Twitch actor and the nominees for best Twitch actor of the year. German985.
[3441.69s -> 3443.85s]  Where's the payphone? Oh my God. Where's the trash?
[3453.05s -> 3457.29s]  I'm just sitting in the audience just like, yeah, I'm in the full like three piece suit.
[3470.23s -> 3476.09s]  Like clasping hands with the person next to me. The eyes closed and the winner for best
[3476.09s -> 3488.78s]  pretender on Twitch. And somebody else and my eyes open. It was supposed to be me.
[3494.07s -> 3500.07s]  What was your acceptance speech V? Yeah. Okay. My acceptance speech to win that award. I would
[3500.07s -> 3507.43s]  go up there and I'd be like, I would start walking down the aisle and I would trip. Oh,
[3507.43s -> 3511.35s]  but it was a joke. I was pretending. Oh, and I would just swipe my head when I got up like,
[3513.03s -> 3532.78s]  everyone would laugh their asses off. You do the Willy Wonka. Yeah. I would look around. I'd be
[3532.78s -> 3538.86s]  like, where's the podium? I put my hand up like I'm looking out over yonder on something like a
[3538.86s -> 3543.98s]  sailing boat. I don't see the podium. And everyone's pointing like it's up there. Oh,
[3543.98s -> 3549.50s]  he's lying to pretender. He's doing it. And I'm like, I can't say it. Where is it? Oh, there it
[3549.50s -> 3567.11s]  is. I spin around like five times. Pantomime the speech. I'd get up there and pretend the mic
[3567.11s -> 3572.54s]  didn't work. I'd be like just moving my mouth with no words. I wouldn't be saying anything.
[3573.26s -> 3596.95s]  Get out of the way. $470. That's just a real life children's. No, that's a clown. That's a mime.
[3597.75s -> 3620.47s]  I'd be a mime without the makeup on. That'd be so stupid. You're always a clown without the makeup
[3620.47s -> 3628.33s]  on silly. God, if I sometimes I wish I just could turn the webcam on right now and just start
[3628.33s -> 3653.16s]  going nuts making a balloon animal. Oh, I'll get that ready one day. Oh, that's the guy. I fight
[3653.16s -> 3669.82s]  that guy. Spoilers. You probably fight everybody in this room over the course of a 12 hour campaign.
[3681.88s -> 3689.88s]  Oh, it's a 70 hour game. Oh,
[3716.22s -> 3719.34s]  I feel like when you catch yourself sitting like that, you go. Oh, fuck. You set up straight.
[3721.18s -> 3723.50s]  Thank you. Oh, my God. What am I? I'm sitting so
[3737.91s -> 3739.91s]  good.
[3747.66s -> 3751.02s]  I feel like I posed these guys in G mod to take a thumbnail picture.
[3782.20s -> 3785.21s]  Oh,
[3791.91s -> 3813.86s]  how do we do that? We simply kill the Batman. Come on. No, I just said it. I just said it for fun.
[3813.86s -> 3816.18s]  I wasn't trying to be like funny. I just like had to say it.
[3816.42s -> 3848.09s]  Oh, that hurt my head. It probably hurt his leg. That sounded like it really fucking hurt.
[3851.93s -> 3853.53s]  That was right in the middle of the shin bone.
[3854.68s -> 3855.96s]  So
[3866.12s -> 3867.08s]  same joke. No.
[3874.09s -> 3877.53s]  Just wait till I get over three hours and I could just get a new goddamn material.
[3893.96s -> 3897.32s]  How am I supposed to? It was like three and a half years ago,
[3897.88s -> 3899.48s]  even longer. It was like four years ago.
[3923.37s -> 3927.85s]  You should have replayed the original stream. Oh, that would have been actually very good idea.
[3937.43s -> 3939.00s]  Let's see if you guys figure it out.
[3939.00s -> 3951.88s]  I'm going to play the VOD from this point. Let's see what happens.
[3956.34s -> 3965.48s]  Everybody hold on a sec. You ready for this shit? We're going to have a little bit of fun.
[3966.12s -> 3973.46s]  I'm going to play it from this exact moment. One sec.
[3973.86s -> 3978.33s]  This guy's name is Bacchus.
[3981.21s -> 3986.74s]  All right. How far did I get? Did I do things in a different order?
[3990.65s -> 3997.58s]  Okay. So did that happen yet? Did this part happen yet?
[3997.58s -> 4026.62s]  I gotta get the right spot. Okay. So right when the cut scene ends,
[4040.44s -> 4043.40s]  I don't want to see any of the jokes. I don't want to see if I want to see if I do it the same way.
[4049.24s -> 4057.38s]  Come on, give me it. All right. Here it is. It loads up right here at one hour and okay.
[4058.33s -> 4062.65s]  Now loading. I have a better computer. I have a better computer.
[4067.40s -> 4076.49s]  Okay. I got the spot. It's one hour, one minute and 27 seconds.
[4092.02s -> 4097.46s]  Oh, no, no. Fuck this game. This game sucks. I don't own it. I don't play it. I'll never play
[4097.46s -> 4102.90s]  it again. It's a dick. I hate this game. Bastion's not the most beautiful zone. Now,
[4102.90s -> 4111.69s]  Drac, this is not a cool. Obviously, I'm going to. All right. 101 27. I thought something was
[4111.69s -> 4120.54s]  really funny right there. All right. 101 27. Thanks for the 256. I'm going to be thanking subs.
[4124.15s -> 4129.50s]  101 27. Whatever the next cut scene is, I think I'm going to have to skip it.
[4129.50s -> 4131.74s]  All right. We're in an in-game cut scene. That might be that. Okay. Here we go.
[4133.58s -> 4140.23s]  And it's going to be like here. All right. Let's get this out of the way.
[4141.85s -> 4166.26s]  I got to get this in the right spot. Okay. So remember, it's like right when the camera pans
[4166.26s -> 4193.14s]  and we go wrong cut scene. No, it's not. Oh, sick cigarette. He took at least a third of that off
[4193.14s -> 4209.06s]  with that hall. By the way, I should probably mute this audio from me so I don't hear what I'm saying.
[4209.38s -> 4214.12s]  Yeah.
[4221.70s -> 4223.46s]  Keep it. All right. Fine.
[4235.90s -> 4238.22s]  Oh, Germany is German Spaniard. No, he's not. I'll make sure he's not.
[4266.62s -> 4273.98s]  Oh, you're bored already. No, I'm not. I'm just I'm not going to do this the whole time.
[4273.98s -> 4297.22s]  I'm just going to do this for a few minutes. He wouldn't do this if he wasn't bored. I'm not
[4297.22s -> 4302.58s]  bored. I'm going to give it the chance it deserves, but I'm just give me a minute.
[4304.50s -> 4313.37s]  I'm not bored. I'm not bored. Are you sure you don't like the TV show, dude? You're looking at
[4313.37s -> 4318.65s]  your phone a lot. Well, we say I'm watching some I'm watching the time that I watched the movie
[4319.62s -> 4325.18s]  four years ago on my phone. That's kind of fucking weird. Why don't you just watch
[4325.18s -> 4330.34s]  the movie with me? I was wondering what my reactions were four years ago.
[4344.02s -> 4352.23s]  Yeah, what a psycho. What like an egomaniac. Like dude, the movie's on the screen right now.
[4352.63s -> 4357.96s]  Man, you don't have to watch you reacting to the movie we're currently watching now.
[4357.96s -> 4380.58s]  Just watch the movie with me. I got to be way funnier than past Jeremy. This is important.
[4380.58s -> 4399.10s]  He thinks he's going to fucking win. Nope. Do the Mario Kart ghost. Yeah, I'm going to
[4399.10s -> 4402.06s]  I'll change that. I'll make the transparency smaller. I'll make it. I'll do it. I just got to
[4402.06s -> 4408.57s]  get in the right spot. OK, here we go. This is important against my ghost. Here we go. Ready?
[4408.57s -> 4418.68s]  I got to get a time that's right. Loading screen. Here comes the pan. And there it is. OK,
[4419.40s -> 4436.79s]  we have synced up the timelines. I am going against my Mario Kart ghost. Can I be funnier
[4436.79s -> 4446.86s]  than my Mario Kart ghost? Let's see. I got to change the opacity on it, though. Filter is
[4446.86s -> 4462.10s]  uh, opacity. Where's opacity? How come I can't drop the opacity? Color correction? No.
[4462.10s -> 4475.82s]  Maybe it is color. No. Promo? OK, here we go. This should be do it. There we go. OK,
[4476.46s -> 4482.06s]  there's my my my Mario Kart ghost is here. Should it be over the whole thing?
[4483.74s -> 4491.59s]  No, I can't. I can't. That's going to make people puke. People are going to get sick.
[4494.65s -> 4506.34s]  I'm going to drop the opacity a little more. That's too much. Mario Kart ghost. OK, it's at 50%.
[4508.25s -> 4519.51s]  All right, I'm ready. I'm ready. Here we go. You ready? I'm going to kick my ass. Three, two,
[4520.23s -> 4524.39s]  one, go. I'm going to get a text message from fucking what's the guy's name? Looks like your
[4524.39s -> 4527.99s]  loan shark has met me up. Alec, the guy that wants to go bowling. What's his name? The cousin.
[4528.87s -> 4532.31s]  Fuck, you heard GTA reference. Derek, what's his name? What's the guy's name that wants to
[4532.31s -> 4535.83s]  always go bowling? Nico. No, not that. Shut up, you. Stop showing me that guy.
[4537.48s -> 4544.20s]  Nick, not Nico. What's the other guy's name? Roman. Why am I still frozen on the other screen?
[4544.84s -> 4553.82s]  Not this guy again. Wait, why is this frozen? I think Derek. Wait, pause it. Pause it. Yeah,
[4553.82s -> 4560.18s]  the old guy from last night. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I found this guy, too. No, it's frozen.
[4560.18s -> 4565.06s]  No, no, I froze it. I teach you how to put points. No, he's so much funnier than me already. Where
[4565.06s -> 4579.46s]  did it go? And this guy is. Why did that happen? Fuck. Hold on. Oh, fuck. Come on. The stupid OBS
[4579.46s -> 4587.98s]  sucks. Hold on. I'm going to get a text message from fucking what's the guy's name? Alec. Alec,
[4587.98s -> 4592.38s]  the guy that wants to go bowling. What's his name? The cousin. I teach you how to put. OK,
[4592.38s -> 4597.10s]  here it is. Oh, you're. Let's get it lined up. Derek, what's his name? What's the guy's name
[4597.10s -> 4603.85s]  that wants to always go bowling? Fuck Streamlabs OBS. It sucks. Stop showing me that guy. All right,
[4603.85s -> 4608.70s]  hold on. Here we go. Nick, not Nico. What's the other guy's name? Roman. There it is.
[4612.23s -> 4623.51s]  Here we go. Ready? Not this guy again. Oh, you're the guy from last night. OK, three, two, one,
[4623.51s -> 4630.60s]  go. Derek. Oh, the old guy from last night. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been searching for hours.
[4630.60s -> 4636.04s]  And I found this guy, too. For me. You Rika booze. You're wasted. I teach you how to put points.
[4637.00s -> 4641.34s]  I just. And this guy is going to teach you how to do things.
[4642.70s -> 4646.81s]  No, fuck. He's past German's going too fast.
[4647.69s -> 4650.87s]  That's somebody's having a good morning. They're really they're really angry,
[4650.87s -> 4655.61s]  really angry people in time to fight. I got it. I got to go faster than a kid.
[4656.33s -> 4659.45s]  Is this the same two guys, three guys that were in the alleyway before?
[4661.83s -> 4666.18s]  Yeah, you mentioned you've been looking for me. Actually, wait, hey, what'd you get? Hey,
[4666.18s -> 4672.76s]  what'd you get those elbow pads for football from the 1930s? Yeah, I did.
[4674.23s -> 4678.87s]  So we they're asking for money. Obviously, I'm going to kick the shit out of these guys.
[4679.75s -> 4682.39s]  I'm going to beat them up and he's going to teach me something.
[4683.51s -> 4687.11s]  I don't know which one's even real. This hurts my head. I can't look at this.
[4687.11s -> 4690.07s]  You think he'd beat you? No, I don't know. That's a great question to ask them. They're
[4690.07s -> 4693.43s]  really eager to talk to you. Don't take don't don't bait the streamer into doing something
[4693.43s -> 4697.59s]  stupid that he doesn't want to do. Oh, hey, speak of the devil. Here they are now.
[4698.71s -> 4706.04s]  Okay. All right, Gramps. Is this the kid? Yes, sir. My prize pupil. Sorry, pupil. This guy's
[4706.04s -> 4710.12s]  just like doesn't feel well. The million you lent the million yen loan that I get those two dead
[4710.12s -> 4715.64s]  beasts is way past due. I need it back. I ain't waiting much longer. You'll tell me about it.
[4715.64s -> 4722.46s]  Wait, I tell you about it. Wait, expect me to tell you. I can't even talk. I can't even talk.
[4722.46s -> 4730.90s]  I have to lower it. It's making me want to throw up. All right. There. That's better. Come on.
[4730.90s -> 4736.71s]  All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. All right. Wait, he's ahead of me. He's ahead of me.
[4736.71s -> 4740.39s]  This guy's definitely like a master boxer. No, no, no, no. Go, go, go. He's way ahead of me.
[4742.86s -> 4747.35s]  Okay. All right. Pay the money. Wise choice. You want to pay me double? I got to beat him.
[4747.99s -> 4752.47s]  No. All right. Let's go. Fight me, you bastards. Teach this whippersnapper how to fight.
[4753.27s -> 4760.71s]  You'll be fine. Just a little workout and fight. All right. I got to kick the shit out of this guy
[4760.71s -> 4765.10s]  right now. Is that me just daydreaming about how I wish I could do that?
[4766.14s -> 4781.27s]  I can't skip the cutscene. That was so much funnier. Okay. It's my turn. That's a great
[4781.27s -> 4785.99s]  smash intro. That's a great like I just won Smash Brothers against like four friends.
[4790.49s -> 4794.17s]  I did say this was going to be a movie in the very beginning. I tried to win you guys.
[4795.13s -> 4804.55s]  Okay. Here we go. I heard the word murder parade. He's fine. Told you. Didn't a big guy. I didn't
[4804.55s -> 4811.13s]  punch him. Go, go, go. That's the same joke but worse. No, it's not. It's better.
[4815.03s -> 4817.67s]  Okay. I meant when I said it wouldn't. You already saw the video. He said it.
[4818.55s -> 4821.83s]  All right. Then round two. I know how to play already. I'm going to kick it. Okay. I'm almost
[4821.83s -> 4827.80s]  ahead. I'm almost ahead. I'm almost ahead. It's free thug. Let's go. You can switch to rush style
[4827.80s -> 4833.27s]  by pressing. I don't care. I was going to get ahead of him. Old German was terrible at video
[4833.27s -> 4842.70s]  games. Actually, he's way better. You can evade. Yep. Evade nine times. How many times has he
[4842.70s -> 4865.50s]  evaded? He's so ahead of me. Come on. All right. Use rush style moves to crush Bruno and show him
[4865.50s -> 4869.18s]  who's boss. When using the rush style, you can stun enemies by hitting them a certain number of
[4869.18s -> 4873.50s]  times. Attacks on stunned enemies will knock them down without fail. All right. Let's go.
[4874.38s -> 4905.02s]  Old German pog. No, don't say that. Old German sucks. New German. New Vegas art. I think I beat
[4905.02s -> 4912.63s]  him. Wait, how much health? I'm beating him. I'm winning. He hit me with every move.
[4917.46s -> 4927.16s]  Come on. I got to dodge. I'm not dodging. Come on, please. All right. Give me a little bit of slack.
[4927.16s -> 4930.12s]  I'm hearing myself fucking talk and I'm hearing the audio twice.
[4930.92s -> 4944.22s]  It's circle, right? That's cool. Cool. All right. We're good. Are we done with the tutorial?
[4944.95s -> 4950.71s]  What? How much longer is the tutorial? No. Yeah, we already were. What family are you guys from?
[4951.35s -> 4956.49s]  Wait, you're a Yakuza? I'm so sorry, sir. I didn't know we work for Toko credit.
[4957.53s -> 4961.77s]  Name's Kiryu. Dojima family. What family are you guys with? Boss, the president. Wait,
[4961.77s -> 4965.85s]  you're a proper Yakuza? Sorry, sir. I didn't know we just work for Toko credit.
[4967.21s -> 4970.89s]  Well, there's no coincidence. I have business with your boss. I need to meet him. Fuck,
[4971.61s -> 4975.77s]  I got to pull that out. President, I figured he'd be at the office this hour.
[4976.81s -> 4980.97s]  I see. That's in a building on Tehei Boulevard East, right? I'll pay him a visit then.
[4982.42s -> 4989.06s]  This is the real fun stuff. Well, I can't wait to have a ton of fucking fun on Thursday.
[4991.96s -> 5006.74s]  I can't. I can't. It's hurting me. This guy's name is Bacchus. I'm sorry, guys. I just skipped a
[5006.74s -> 5018.65s]  little bit. This guy can teach me a lot about fighting. OK, in the parking lot. OK, so this
[5018.65s -> 5025.21s]  guy's in the parking lot. This guy hangs out and drinks and like levels you up. And there's a guy
[5025.21s -> 5037.90s]  at a bank like I know this is going to be fun. I can't wait. This guy wants me to box for a living
[5037.90s -> 5043.88s]  and like he wants to make money. Well, it's karaoke. You guys hear me? Anybody hear me?
[5045.06s -> 5053.69s]  I'm like fading out of it. I feel weird. What's fucking happening? OK, so I got to go to the bank.
[5053.69s -> 5060.95s]  Oh, no, no, I'm I'm denial. Oh, fuck. What an idiotic thing to do. I went back in time
[5061.75s -> 5066.47s]  and I fuck with the timelines. I'm trying to replace myself. No, this is weird. I feel like
[5066.47s -> 5072.79s]  I'm drunk. The fuck? Why can't I go in here? No, I'm I feel I taste I taste like metal
[5074.23s -> 5085.40s]  out of my way. Anybody hear me? Uh, OK, let's just do this. Get this out of the way. No, I have to
[5085.40s -> 5090.92s]  stop and catch my I can run more than this guy. How sad is that? This guy's like a mastermind
[5090.92s -> 5096.28s]  Yakuza assassin. He can sprint down an alley and then he has to catch his breath. I can run
[5096.92s -> 5103.98s]  like a mile like that. I could run a full sprint mile. This guy can't even do it around a fucking
[5103.98s -> 5111.02s]  corner. Get ready for this. No, go in the building. Like, what do you mean get go get ready?
[5112.06s -> 5121.50s]  I want to get through this as fast as possible. I'm ready. Oh, maybe I wasn't ready.
[5121.50s -> 5127.42s]  I'm ready. These guys all have like weapons. What are you doing here, punk?
[5131.10s -> 5133.58s]  It's like the same guy.
[5146.65s -> 5148.65s]  OK, no interest in speaking with me. That's fine.
[5149.45s -> 5154.33s]  This is the first test. This is the first test of real raw game.
[5156.97s -> 5163.96s]  Time to go. Oh, go credit men. They have pipes. Let's go into our dodge.
[5181.10s -> 5191.58s]  Um, that was kind of fun. But where am I? I better get moving. Come on, Bruno. Pick it up.
[5193.08s -> 5202.17s]  Wait, I just saw the birth of Jesus. And then it's it's it's leaving. It's leaving.
[5202.17s -> 5205.13s]  That's all the dinosaurs die. It's leaving. It's leaving. It's leaving. It's leaving.
[5205.13s -> 5208.33s]  No, no, no, no. They were swimming. What? No, no, no, no, no. It's gone. It's gone. What's happening?
[5209.13s -> 5221.86s]  I um, hey, tell me something. Oh, just who are you? Why approach me? What are you after me? Yes.
[5221.86s -> 5226.34s]  Well, people here call me Bacchus and I come here because you had me angry at one time.
[5227.64s -> 5232.14s]  Yeah, nice of you to dump him on me. Look, if you're in some trouble, tell me. Maybe I can help.
[5232.94s -> 5236.87s]  And that goes for him too. Those weren't the moves of an amateur. What's his deal?
[5237.85s -> 5243.19s]  A real steal of a deal is what it is. He's got a gig sweatier than honey.
[5244.87s -> 5247.75s]  He's fascinating to watch. You should go have a look too.
[5248.63s -> 5252.09s]  At Comedio's job, but he's homeless, right? What kind of work does he do?
[5253.14s -> 5256.42s]  He's a whatchamacallit. A fristing artist.
[5257.67s -> 5262.14s]  Whoa, that's not really my scene. Let's punch out.
[5263.02s -> 5269.10s]  Yeah, that. A punch out artist. A slip of the tongue. All right, so what's a punch out artist?
[5270.57s -> 5273.53s]  The customer pays a fee and then they get to throw as many punches at me as they like.
[5274.33s -> 5276.57s]  I don't think I follow. This is a new S&M thing.
[5278.06s -> 5282.54s]  No, nothing like that. Come on and watch. If you've got questions, I work in the Shichufuku
[5282.54s -> 5287.66s]  parking lot. Jimo-kun, he's got plenty to teach about fighting, my boy.
[5287.66s -> 5289.18s]  You'll kick yourself if you don't check it out.
[5290.41s -> 5293.13s]  All right, I'll get the picture. Parking lot, right? I swing by if I can.
[5293.93s -> 5297.99s]  It's Kira-san from the Dojima family, right? I'll be waiting. See you soon.
[5299.06s -> 5301.22s]  Okay. Sorry, what am I gonna go here?
[5301.94s -> 5307.98s]  Well, that takes care of my troubles for today, I suppose. Still can't convince you to take on the
[5307.98s -> 5313.50s]  world. The world? What does it even mean? Are you still trying to recruit me into the pro fighting
[5313.50s -> 5317.91s]  scene? It's exactly what it was. You got potential most men can't even dream about.
[5317.91s -> 5322.66s]  That would champ the title be yours. Sorry, I'm not the same starry-eyed kid who would fall for
[5322.66s -> 5327.96s]  that kind of line. You look at a scout, somebody keep looking. I'll tell you one thing, boy. You
[5327.96s -> 5332.84s]  keep living street fight to street fight. You'll wind up with a knife between your ribs. It's a
[5332.84s -> 5337.48s]  dark alley. That's no way to go out. You belong in the light, the spotlight, and I can't get you
[5337.48s -> 5343.42s]  under the brightest ones. What do you say? Okay. We just met. You're not wanting to change your
[5343.42s -> 5348.41s]  life around because some old geezer told you to. So I'll give up. That doesn't mean giving up for
[5348.41s -> 5354.84s]  good. You got room to grow like a tree. I'll keep coaching you along the way. You've got skills as
[5354.84s -> 5360.76s]  a trainer. That much I believe. But I'm not really in a position to be worrying about that. Sorry,
[5360.76s -> 5365.16s]  but hey, maybe I'll see you around. Okay, my boy. Just steer clear of the dark alley still then,
[5365.16s -> 5371.59s]  you hear? No knives in those ribs or bullets for that matter. Are you trying to jinx me? You see
[5371.59s -> 5381.50s]  you later, Pockus. Okay. Apparently the Toko credit president's in his office on Tai Boulevard East.
[5381.50s -> 5403.21s]  I'll start there. All right, let's go. I'm gonna head down this way. I'm stuck. Oh, oh, oh, what's
[5403.21s -> 5414.28s]  oh. Oh, man. These guys. Oh, shit. These guys got weapons. What? Never mind. These guys have
[5414.28s -> 5438.54s]  weapons. No, they don't. What? I don't have any weapons. Why did I say that? He's punching the
[5438.54s -> 5456.92s]  air. What do I think of the game so far? Jokes aside. I don't know. See me when I after three
[5456.92s -> 5476.49s]  hours. Boring. It's not boring. I can't I'm not saying that yet. Okay, so I go in here or why
[5477.67s -> 5508.44s]  in the trash? What am I looking at here? What's what is what's here? The front? The door? Oh,
[5508.44s -> 5515.59s]  I tried to click on this. I hit a on this like three times. All right, let's get ready first.
[5518.39s -> 5540.31s]  Uh, let me save the game. Go to karaoke. No, hold on. Not yet. That bastard. All right,
[5540.31s -> 5547.02s]  let's get some exp. I'm not gonna go play blackjack. Let me play the game first. I'm
[5547.02s -> 5571.34s]  not gonna go play blackjack. Go play Mahjong. No, I want to play. Leave me alone. Leave me alone.
[5571.34s -> 5602.31s]  Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Oh, my God. I'm sorry, sir. Yeah, good. Well,
[5602.31s -> 5612.26s]  you know, let's just do the first mission. Let's do it. I'm ready. Mahjong is more entertaining
[5612.26s -> 5622.68s]  than the game. There's a great link. No, no, I have to get to the. Okay, I will link this
[5622.68s -> 5634.70s]  because this is funny. This is funny. It's very good. I feel like I've aged that much too.
[5638.15s -> 5644.54s]  What's with the huge amount of subs? Forty two community subs from bingo. Bingo Julius
[5644.54s -> 5659.80s]  just gave 42 subs. Oh, my God. That's too many subs. Thank you. Thank you, bingo. That's insane.
[5660.44s -> 5666.02s]  Oh, these guys are toast.
[5697.69s -> 5698.33s]  Worst joke.
[5702.33s -> 5713.38s]  All right, it's time to play the game. We had our fun. Now I want to actually do good.
[5728.20s -> 5733.72s]  Breaking. So, um, I have how do I activate the rush? I kind of wasn't paying attention to that.
[5733.72s -> 5751.02s]  I'll be honest. It is activated. How do I press V? No, no, no, on a controller.
[5755.34s -> 5772.97s]  Left on D pad. There it is. Thank you. Any more snacks? What the fuck? All right, here we go,
[5772.97s -> 5792.57s]  brother. Oh, that's right. This stances. Right. This game is sick. Oh, I missed the cutscene.
[5799.30s -> 5807.18s]  Right in the head. Forced enjoyment. Dude, I'm having so much fun in this game. Sick. Nice. Cool.
[5807.18s -> 5839.51s]  Cool. Sick. Sick. It is fun. How do I get health? I'm running out. No way. How'd you make it here?
[5842.55s -> 5843.19s]  Snacks, right?
[5851.10s -> 5869.75s]  Tell me everything.
[5895.38s -> 5896.74s]  All right, this is what I'm talking about.
[5899.19s -> 5922.28s]  Oh,
[5939.03s -> 5942.07s]  back in the day, one punch was enough to straighten out little shits like you.
[5943.27s -> 5946.47s]  What do you mean back in the day? Like when I was a kid? Like when I was like,
[5946.47s -> 5948.79s]  how old was I? What the fuck are you talking about?
[5956.90s -> 6003.18s]  How long have I known this guy for? He's like in his 50s. Oh, no, not a cigarette.
[6033.35s -> 6033.99s]  It's no shame.
[6040.12s -> 6045.18s]  You'd listen to this dead air streamer.
[6054.09s -> 6063.86s]  Cool.
[6063.86s -> 6075.14s]  King of Dead Air. Well, it's a cutscene. Every time I talk over cutscenes, people get so mad at me.

[7253.26s -> 7254.22s]  Karaoke now.
[7261.50s -> 7266.42s]  All right. When I wasn't looking, it kind of sounded like he was ripping a bunch of
[7266.42s -> 7269.85s]  tape. He was taping a bunch of shit up on the desk.
[7283.16s -> 7290.02s]  Did he ask you to sell out Kazama? He did.
[7294.63s -> 7295.11s]  Bastard.
[7307.80s -> 7308.68s]  Somebody framed him.
[7317.34s -> 7330.90s]  Well, you see, it all started when I went into his office and what if it just plays
[7330.90s -> 7344.54s]  that cut scene again, but with a filter on it. They would do that.
[7355.29s -> 7385.27s]  I had my hand around my neck. It's three. What?
[7393.42s -> 7399.43s]  So I was rubbing my neck. I was rubbing and I went like this.
[7401.59s -> 7407.11s]  I am paying attention. Yes, I am. He's just choking himself instead of watching the cut
[7407.11s -> 7422.23s]  scene. No, I am paying attention to the cut scene. And this dude is fucking strangling himself.
[7423.99s -> 7426.47s]  Do you not like the movie? We can put on like designers,
[7426.47s -> 7431.51s]  drive-ins and dives if you want. No, man. I love this fucking movie. It's great.
[7457.70s -> 7476.58s]  He's choking himself. I can't. I got to mute.
[7476.58s -> 7477.22s]  What the hell?
[7477.22s -> 7489.06s]  Well, summarize this cut scene. Okay. Yeah, I can.
[7492.82s -> 7496.58s]  So this is the boss. This is one of the bosses.
[7499.03s -> 7502.07s]  Guys, I don't even know this person's name. I don't know the main character's name.
[7509.72s -> 7518.60s]  What's his name? Kiryu. Kiryu. Fuck, I'm sorry.
[7530.55s -> 7536.44s]  We're trying to get rid of the other boss. There's three bosses, four bosses.
[7540.15s -> 7541.59s]  We're all fighting over the same place.
[7546.97s -> 7573.03s]  I'm watching a foreign film without subtitles because I'm like reading chat too. So I'm not
[7573.03s -> 7581.48s]  absorbing any of this. Like if it was English, I would be able to hear a lot of this too. I'm
[7581.88s -> 7589.91s]  hanging out with you guys reading chat and I'm just hearing Japanese. That's not good.
[7605.53s -> 7613.22s]  No, I'm good. I'm good. We got to watch our asses. Watch ourselves.
[7616.63s -> 7631.98s]  Focus on the game for 10 minutes. Okay, I will. I swear to God.
[7633.18s -> 7635.50s]  I'm not looking at chat. I'm going to focus for 10 straight minutes.
[7644.90s -> 7649.38s]  I'm responsible. What am I responsible for? Let's see.
[7650.18s -> 7654.42s]  Okay, Kazama. We don't want him to come back to Kazama.
[7666.46s -> 7667.42s]  I'm taking the fall for this.
[7676.50s -> 7677.54s]  Oh, man. Okay.
[7687.16s -> 7688.20s]  I'm going to care this one myself.
[7688.20s -> 7698.76s]  All right. So then I'm not tied to like the Yakuza family, right?
[7700.92s -> 7703.16s]  The Yakuza, right? Okay.
[7713.96s -> 7715.08s]  I want out.
[7721.61s -> 7731.85s]  Let's go. We're going to settle this right now.
[7741.82s -> 7747.72s]  They're framing people. They're framing people.
[7757.30s -> 7772.44s]  Whoa.
[7783.90s -> 7804.71s]  Okay. He's playing PUBG on his phone right now. If I just had it like the sound effects.
[7805.67s -> 7820.81s]  I don't have it installed. Stop reading chat. He was lying on the ground with a painful face.
[7820.81s -> 7824.25s]  I can pay attention. I can look away for a second. He's like there's no dialogue there.
[7827.50s -> 7851.64s]  And now we're framed for the murder of the guy in the beginning. We're out of the family.
[7851.64s -> 7858.28s]  Now we're trying to stop these guys from framing people for murders, especially when it's me.
[7858.44s -> 7886.98s]  You can't just leave. You can't get out, right? Let's go.
[7893.05s -> 7910.95s]  A bad deal in chat? No, I'm ready. I'm ready to complete.
[7911.75s -> 7923.83s]  What was the VOD for the last one? Three hours and what? 335. Okay.
[7946.28s -> 7981.19s]  We've looked up to you. Won't let us be in Yakuza.
[8004.02s -> 8022.30s]  I thought he was like driving. Is he driving? Pay attention. What the fuck? Oh God. I thought
[8022.30s -> 8026.78s]  he was like driving the car and just off. He's in his own world. I'm like holy shit dude. What
[8026.78s -> 8044.31s]  are you doing? Finally, you say something. We're watching a fucking cut scene.
[8056.42s -> 8061.70s]  Every so often, I'm going to take the back of my hand and get you in the chest.
[8063.70s -> 8066.90s]  You see that? They wanted to be Yakuza. I'm paying attention.
[8070.42s -> 8073.30s]  This next part, man. I can't wait to pay attention to this part.
[8088.49s -> 8090.73s]  He's secretly just leveling in Maldraxxus right now.
[8104.06s -> 8117.27s]  Yeah, I'm really going to stop treating the cut scenes in this game like I'm in a league
[8117.27s -> 8124.12s]  queue. Yeah, whatever. I'm just going to play like fucking Picross for like 12 minutes until
[8124.12s -> 8145.21s]  a queue pops. Oh, there's still a lot of subs that I missed too.

[8250.33s -> 8255.54s]  I'm not here to talk to you. Where's the head of the gang?
[8255.54s -> 8259.42s]  I'm the one who's in charge of the gang right now.
[8261.98s -> 8263.98s]  I'll be careful with the way you talk.
[8279.91s -> 8281.91s]  You're a good boy.

[10113.07s -> 10122.88s]  Perfect, I know exactly what's going on now.
[10137.63s -> 10163.49s]  Killer.
[10178.62s -> 10193.80s]  Simpsons.
[10214.89s -> 10258.05s]  That's pretty good episode.
[10258.05s -> 10263.05s]  Stream. Oh my God, stream is gone.
[10263.05s -> 10269.29s]  It's over. Oh shit, I forgot.
[10269.29s -> 10275.68s]  It's no sorry. I was playing it through the microphone. I was playing it through the microphone.
[10275.68s -> 10280.05s]  It doesn't matter. That was me singing that. There's me humming it with my mouth.
[10280.05s -> 10302.09s]  Was this like a jazz version? What is this?
[10302.09s -> 10308.23s]  This doesn't happen in the Simpsons theme song.
[10308.23s -> 10321.40s]  This is not the Simpsons theme song. That's like a completely different version.
[10321.40s -> 10324.40s]  Look at the game. Oh, right. All right, we got an umbrella.
[10324.40s -> 10326.40s]  Somebody under an umbrella and they're teaching us something.
[10326.40s -> 10329.40s]  They've been waiting for us for a long time.
[10329.40s -> 10355.30s]  I've been waiting. Yes, I knew it.
[10355.30s -> 10361.69s]  Chapter one. 12 million, 12 million yen. Nice.
[10361.69s -> 10367.92s]  IMAX battles have opened. Save it.
[10367.92s -> 10374.85s]  Chapter two, the real estate broker in the shadows. Cool.
[10374.85s -> 10424.07s]  Big windows. I talked about that already.
[10424.07s -> 10432.00s]  I don't think you can see everything.
[10432.00s -> 10441.93s]  You're just a giant TV show for everybody that looks up.
[10441.93s -> 10445.00s]  There's no danger to me.
[10445.00s -> 10456.36s]  Mr. Kiryu, please relax.
[10456.36s -> 10459.94s]  Tinted? Well, all right.
[10459.94s -> 10465.36s]  So sure. Tinted windows. Would you stand naked in front of that window?
[10465.36s -> 10467.36s]  No, you wouldn't.
[10467.36s -> 10469.92s]  I'll pay you back right away.
[10469.92s -> 10474.27s]  Mr. Tachibana.
[10474.27s -> 10478.22s]  Yes, please rest assured.
[10478.22s -> 10480.52s]  I am a man of my own.
[10480.52s -> 10485.15s]  In Kamurocho, I'm asking for real estate.
[10485.15s -> 10488.90s]  Real estate? What does that look like to me?
[10488.90s -> 10492.53s]  You really don't eat?
[10492.53s -> 10494.53s]  What's for dinner?
[10494.53s -> 10509.88s]  What do we have?
[10509.88s -> 10511.56s]  What do we have?
[10511.56s -> 10516.81s]  The right hand is a technique.
[10516.81s -> 10519.24s]  It's a way to forgive.
[10519.24s -> 10523.93s]  After losing it a few years ago, it hurts when it gets cold.
[10523.93s -> 10526.11s]  It's a strange thing.
[10526.11s -> 10529.11s]  It doesn't work on the fingertips, and it doesn't work on the painkillers.
[10529.11s -> 10532.11s]  I just endure the pain in the middle of the day.
[10532.11s -> 10537.11s]  But it's a hassle to put pain on my face, so I quit.
[10537.11s -> 10540.41s]  I didn't hear that.
[10540.41s -> 10545.59s]  Mr. Kiryu, do you know the word Tojo Kajo?
[10545.59s -> 10547.59s]  Tojo?
[10547.59s -> 10548.59s]  Tojo.
[10548.59s -> 10550.02s]  Tojo Kajo.
[10550.02s -> 10556.02s]  Many flowers gather together and become one big flower.
[10556.02s -> 10561.45s]  In fact, some of the flowers you know are Tojo Kajo.
[10561.45s -> 10563.88s]  What are you talking about?
[10563.88s -> 10566.83s]  It's a sunflower.
[10568.71s -> 10570.71s]  That's true.
[10570.71s -> 10572.71s]  They're beautiful. That's true.
[10572.71s -> 10576.71s]  It's a good name to use for a child's kindergarten.
[10576.71s -> 10581.29s]  Kazama-san named you sunflower?
[10581.29s -> 10582.29s]  You.
[10582.29s -> 10590.32s]  You grew up with Nishikiyama-san and your brothers in sunflower.
[10590.32s -> 10591.68s]  Another one.
[10591.68s -> 10594.86s]  Yumi Sawamura-san, a young lady.
[10594.86s -> 10600.42s]  Eventually, you and Nishikiyama-san followed Kazama-san as parents.
[10600.42s -> 10603.42s]  Then you entered the world of Jokudo.
[10603.42s -> 10607.42s]  And now you're wearing a murder suit.
[10607.42s -> 10612.42s]  Because of that, Kazama-san is in danger.
[10612.42s -> 10614.42s]  I know what my life was.
[10614.42s -> 10617.66s]  I understand that you investigated me.
[10617.66s -> 10621.16s]  You have a lot of information.
[10621.16s -> 10623.65s]  But why did you investigate me?
[10623.65s -> 10626.65s]  What is your purpose?
[10626.65s -> 10628.83s]  You don't know, he knows.
[10628.83s -> 10630.83s]  No, that's right.
[10638.08s -> 10640.08s]  Empty lot.
[10645.90s -> 10646.90s]  That bread.
[10646.90s -> 10649.84s]  I want that bread right now.
[10655.21s -> 10660.21s]  If we get the empty lot, then Kazama's expulsion is guaranteed.
[10664.40s -> 10668.08s]  If we don't get rid of your eagerness.
[10668.08s -> 10672.26s]  Our information in Kamurocho is a little bit.
[10672.26s -> 10677.38s]  If you join hands with me, you can definitely finish the criminal.
[10677.38s -> 10680.75s]  Why are you trying to drag me into this?
[10681.75s -> 10683.75s]  What is your real purpose?
[10687.97s -> 10689.97s]  Give me back my clothes, Tachibana-san.
[10689.97s -> 10693.04s]  I'm begging you.
[10693.04s -> 10694.04s]  Kobamuto.
[10694.04s -> 10698.24s]  Your story is too convenient for me.
[10698.24s -> 10703.24s]  At times like this, you have to be careful.
[10703.24s -> 10705.24s]  There's no way you can survive.
[10707.24s -> 10708.24s]  I see.
[10708.24s -> 10712.43s]  It seems you've been looking a little too sweet.
[10712.43s -> 10715.43s]  But I believe you'll think about it some day.
[10715.43s -> 10720.24s]  At least, can you take this card with you?
[10720.24s -> 10726.46s]  I understand.
[10726.46s -> 10728.46s]  I'll bring the clothes right away.
[10728.46s -> 10732.96s]  Well then, I'll be going.
[10737.33s -> 10738.33s]  That's not necessarily true.
[10738.33s -> 10740.33s]  I mean, look at Metal Gear Solid 3.
[10740.33s -> 10741.33s]  Metal Gear Solid 4.
[10741.33s -> 10745.76s]  Wasn't that game like 4 hours of cutscenes before you pressed B to punch anybody?
[10745.76s -> 10763.11s]  Look at that series, right?
[10763.11s -> 10764.11s]  Alright, so here we are.
[10764.11s -> 10766.99s]  Let's save it.
[10766.99s -> 10769.74s]  Is the arcade open?
[10769.74s -> 10771.74s]  If it is, you know exactly where I'm going.
[10771.74s -> 10785.82s]  Alright, so let's take a look at the map.
[10785.82s -> 10793.75s]  Alright, so we have Sega High Tech Land and the bowling alley.
[10793.75s -> 10795.75s]  I want to go to High Tech Land.
[10795.75s -> 10807.72s]  Is this Sega High Tech Land?
[10807.72s -> 10809.34s]  No?
[10809.34s -> 10811.99s]  Wait, did I?
[10811.99s -> 10813.29s]  Okay, yeah, that's it.
[10813.29s -> 10814.29s]  Where is it?
[10814.29s -> 10817.71s]  Wrong way?
[10817.71s -> 10819.91s]  Entrance is on the other side.
[10819.91s -> 10820.91s]  Oh.
[10820.91s -> 10825.35s]  I don't have time to fight you.
[10825.35s -> 10827.35s]  I want to play video games.
[10827.35s -> 10829.36s]  Leave me alone.
[10829.36s -> 10831.36s]  This is dumb.
[10831.36s -> 10833.36s]  No, it's not.
[10833.36s -> 10838.57s]  Yes.
[10838.57s -> 10839.57s]  Okay, I've never done this before.
[10839.57s -> 10840.57s]  Is this fun in here?
[10840.57s -> 10845.50s]  Oh my god, yes.
[10845.50s -> 10848.08s]  How much is it?
[10848.08s -> 10850.58s]  300 yen for three games.
[10850.58s -> 10851.58s]  Let's go.
[10851.58s -> 10859.20s]  Okay, Move Claw.
[10859.20s -> 10863.12s]  That's it right there.
[10863.12s -> 10864.12s]  I got it.
[10864.12s -> 10865.62s]  And that's a pink one too.
[10865.62s -> 10866.62s]  It's rare.
[10866.62s -> 10867.62s]  It's worth so much more.
[10867.62s -> 10868.62s]  I'll take it.
[10868.62s -> 10877.35s]  What's it worth?
[10877.35s -> 10880.76s]  Funchan.
[10880.76s -> 10882.07s]  Nice.
[10882.07s -> 10883.07s]  Alright, cool.
[10883.07s -> 10884.07s]  I got two more.
[10884.07s -> 10887.78s]  Give me the other pink one.
[10887.78s -> 10888.78s]  Nope, I fucked it up.
[10888.78s -> 10889.78s]  I might still get it.
[10889.78s -> 10893.20s]  It's possible.
[10893.20s -> 10894.20s]  I might get it.
[10894.20s -> 10904.14s]  Oh, I got to get him.
[10904.14s -> 10905.14s]  He's hanging out back there.
[10905.14s -> 10906.14s]  I have to get him.
[10906.14s -> 10910.52s]  That's a good start.
[10910.52s -> 10911.52s]  There it is.
[10911.52s -> 10914.87s]  I'll take it home with me.
[10914.87s -> 10915.87s]  I'm going to put it on the wall.
[10915.87s -> 10918.36s]  That's the one right there.
[10918.36s -> 10919.36s]  Scoop him.
[10919.36s -> 10921.18s]  Yes.
[10921.18s -> 10922.93s]  Oh, it's alright.
[10922.93s -> 10926.41s]  I got one.
[10926.41s -> 10930.28s]  It's alright.
[10930.28s -> 10931.28s]  I got one.
[10931.28s -> 10932.28s]  What else is in here?
[10932.28s -> 10933.45s]  Can I play these?
[10933.45s -> 10934.45s]  Is this Galaga?
[10934.45s -> 10935.45s]  Space Harrier.
[10935.45s -> 10940.34s]  100 to play.
[10940.34s -> 10941.34s]  Of course I do.
[10941.34s -> 10942.34s]  I'll give it a go.
[10942.34s -> 10943.34s]  Space Harrier?
[10943.34s -> 10945.80s]  Fire.
[10945.80s -> 10950.49s]  Select.
[10950.49s -> 10951.49s]  Insert.
[10951.49s -> 10953.95s]  Credit.
[10953.95s -> 10959.22s]  Rapid fire.
[10959.22s -> 10960.22s]  Switch screen type.
[10960.22s -> 10961.59s]  Okay.
[10961.59s -> 10962.59s]  Whatever.
[10962.59s -> 10963.59s]  How many coins should I put in?
[10963.59s -> 10964.89s]  Controls are reversed.
[10964.89s -> 10966.84s]  This is a real Sega game, isn't it?
[10966.84s -> 10967.84s]  Oh, dude.
[10967.84s -> 10970.36s]  Play Tohoku!
[10970.36s -> 10971.36s]  Play Tohoku!
[10971.36s -> 10973.62s]  Play Tohoku!
[10974.92s -> 10988.13s]  Controls are reversed.
[10988.13s -> 10989.13s]  This is a real Sega game, isn't it?
[10989.13s -> 10996.32s]  Oh, dude.
[10996.32s -> 10997.32s]  Play Tohoku!
[10997.32s -> 11006.88s]  Play Tohoku!
[11006.88s -> 11007.88s]  Play Tohoku!
[11007.88s -> 11008.88s]  You love Tohoku.
[11008.88s -> 11009.88s]  You love Tohoku.
[11009.88s -> 11011.70s]  Oh, why has he not played it yet?
[11011.70s -> 11012.70s]  No, no, no.
[11012.70s -> 11013.70s]  Don't play the first one.
[11013.70s -> 11017.12s]  Don't play the second one.
[11017.12s -> 11018.12s]  There's a third version of the 17th game.
[11018.12s -> 11020.25s]  That's the one you should play.
[11020.25s -> 11021.25s]  That's the best music.
[11021.25s -> 11022.25s]  Don't play the other one.
[11022.25s -> 11023.25s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[11023.25s -> 11024.25s]  Tohoku 16 version 4.
[11024.25s -> 11025.25s]  No, no, no.
[11025.25s -> 11026.25s]  Not that one.
[11026.25s -> 11027.56s]  Shoot him in the head, right?
[11027.56s -> 11028.56s]  I might break through his skin.
[11028.56s -> 11029.56s]  I might break through his skin.
[11029.56s -> 11030.56s]  I might break through his skin.
[11030.56s -> 11031.56s]  I might break through his skin.
[11060.89s -> 11061.89s]  Oh, wait.
[11061.89s -> 11063.90s]  It's in the head.
[11063.90s -> 11064.90s]  I win.
[11064.90s -> 11066.33s]  Stage 2.
[11066.33s -> 11067.33s]  Let's go.
[11067.33s -> 11068.89s]  How many stages are in this game?
[11068.89s -> 11075.25s]  One?
[11075.25s -> 11089.55s]  It's kind of loud and it hurts my ears.
[11089.55s -> 11090.55s]  I'm sorry if it's happening to you too.
[11090.55s -> 11097.80s]  It's very painful.
[11097.80s -> 11099.24s]  You can't even fucking buy dodges like this one, bro.
[11099.24s -> 11100.24s]  You can't even buy dodges like this one.
[11100.24s -> 11101.24s]  They're not.
[11101.24s -> 11102.24s]  They're not.
[11102.24s -> 11103.24s]  Come on.
[11103.24s -> 11104.24s]  Ooh.
[11104.24s -> 11115.46s]  Ooh.
[11115.46s -> 11116.46s]  How do I know?
[11116.46s -> 11117.46s]  I don't know.
[11117.46s -> 11131.50s]  I don't know.
[11131.50s -> 11132.50s]  I don't know.
[11132.50s -> 11133.50s]  I don't know.
[11133.50s -> 11134.50s]  I don't know.
[11134.50s -> 11135.93s]  I don't know.
[11135.93s -> 11146.13s]  I don't know.
[11146.13s -> 11147.13s]  I don't know.
[11147.13s -> 11151.12s]  I don't know.
[11158.89s -> 11159.89s]  How do I know?
[11159.89s -> 11160.89s]  How do I get out?
[11160.89s -> 11161.89s]  I don't want to play.
[11161.89s -> 11162.89s]  Whoa.
[11162.89s -> 11163.89s]  What the fuck was that?
[11163.89s -> 11164.89s]  Welcome to the family.
[11164.89s -> 11165.89s]  Get ready.
[11165.89s -> 11166.89s]  Let's go.
[11166.89s -> 11172.79s]  Give me up.
[11172.79s -> 11175.18s]  M.
[11175.18s -> 11176.18s]  How do I quit?
[11176.18s -> 11178.44s]  How do I leave?
[11178.44s -> 11183.82s]  I want to do that thing where you buy, you put like five quarters into the machine and
[11183.82s -> 11185.10s]  you have to leave the arcade.
[11185.10s -> 11187.42s]  So you're just like, no, but I can't leave.
[11187.42s -> 11192.10s]  There's like five, there's five credits in here, but you have to fucking go.
[11192.10s -> 11193.10s]  And your mom's like, get in the car.
[11193.10s -> 11194.10s]  We've got to fucking go now.
[11194.10s -> 11195.10s]  And it's like, fine.
[11195.34s -> 11199.02s]  And you leave and then some kid comes over and it's like, holy shit.
[11199.02s -> 11201.84s]  This one's got credits in it.
[11201.84s -> 11203.93s]  A bunch of them.
[11203.93s -> 11208.90s]  You make somebody's day when you do that.
[11208.90s -> 11209.90s]  It's so loud.
[11209.90s -> 11211.33s]  I have to stop.
[11211.33s -> 11218.78s]  How do I get out?
[11218.78s -> 11219.96s]  The back button?
[11219.96s -> 11224.14s]  That was fun.
[11224.14s -> 11226.60s]  What else is in here?
[11226.60s -> 11230.01s]  Welcome to Sega arcade.
[11230.01s -> 11233.09s]  What can I do for you?
[11233.09s -> 11234.57s]  Change UFO catcher prizes.
[11234.57s -> 11246.39s]  I think it needs new prizes.
[11246.39s -> 11247.39s]  That's kind of annoying.
[11247.39s -> 11254.13s]  What's this?
[11254.13s -> 11255.13s]  Can I do this one?
[11255.13s -> 11256.13s]  No.
[11259.47s -> 11263.52s]  Only two games in here?
[11263.52s -> 11266.52s]  Only two games in here?
[11266.52s -> 11267.52s]  What's this bullshit?
[11267.52s -> 11269.78s]  Wait a minute.
[11269.78s -> 11281.96s]  I have to get the egg.
[11281.96s -> 11285.57s]  That's a win.
[11285.57s -> 11286.57s]  That's a win.
[11286.57s -> 11287.57s]  That's a win.
[11287.57s -> 11288.57s]  It is.
[11288.57s -> 11289.57s]  I got it.
[11289.57s -> 11290.57s]  I got it.
[11290.57s -> 11291.57s]  I got it.
[11291.57s -> 11296.01s]  I got it.
[11296.01s -> 11297.01s]  I got it.
[11297.01s -> 11301.07s]  I got it.
[11301.07s -> 11302.07s]  I got it.
[11302.07s -> 11309.45s]  I got it.
[11309.45s -> 11312.16s]  I got it.
[11312.16s -> 11313.16s]  I got it.
[11313.16s -> 11314.16s]  I got it.
[11314.16s -> 11319.82s]  I got it.
[11319.82s -> 11337.44s]  I got it.
[11337.44s -> 11340.48s]  I got it.
[11340.48s -> 11341.48s]  I got it.
[11341.48s -> 11342.48s]  I got it.
[11342.48s -> 11343.48s]  I got it.
[11343.60s -> 11344.60s]  I got it.
[11344.60s -> 11345.60s]  I got it.
[11345.60s -> 11346.60s]  I got it.
[11346.60s -> 11347.60s]  I got it.
[11347.60s -> 11348.60s]  I got it.
[11348.60s -> 11349.60s]  I got it.
[11349.60s -> 11354.42s]  I got it.
[11354.42s -> 11355.42s]  I got it.
[11355.42s -> 11357.88s]  I got it.
[11357.88s -> 11359.12s]  I got it.
[11359.12s -> 11360.74s]  I got it.
[11360.74s -> 11361.74s]  I got it.
[11361.74s -> 11362.74s]  I got it.
[11362.74s -> 11363.74s]  I got it.
[11363.74s -> 11364.74s]  I got it.
[11364.74s -> 11371.16s]  I got it.
[11371.16s -> 11372.16s]  I got it.
[11372.16s -> 11380.76s]  I got it.
[11380.76s -> 11382.71s]  I got it.
[11382.71s -> 11383.71s]  I got it.
[11383.71s -> 11389.17s]  I got it.
[11389.17s -> 11390.17s]  I got it.
[11390.17s -> 11392.82s]  I got it.
[11392.82s -> 11399.56s]  I got it.
[11399.56s -> 11400.56s]  I got it.
[11400.56s -> 11401.56s]  I got it.
[11401.56s -> 11402.56s]  I got it.
[11402.56s -> 11404.06s]  I got it.
[11404.06s -> 11405.06s]  I got it.
[11405.18s -> 11407.83s]  All right.
[11407.83s -> 11408.83s]  We got a lizard.
[11408.83s -> 11414.04s]  OK.
[11414.04s -> 11418.52s]  Now we're going to get the whatever this is back here.
[11418.52s -> 11426.52s]  Perfect.
[11426.52s -> 11428.60s]  Get it.
[11428.60s -> 11429.60s]  No.
[11429.60s -> 11430.60s]  Come on.
[11430.60s -> 11434.46s]  Just throw it in there.
[11434.46s -> 11435.46s]  Yes.
[11435.46s -> 11446.30s]  And the blue one.
[11446.30s -> 11448.37s]  That's pretty good.
[11448.37s -> 11452.11s]  Get the other lizards.
[11452.11s -> 11453.11s]  I got his hat.
[11453.11s -> 11454.73s]  Come on.
[11454.73s -> 11455.73s]  Just drag him over there.
[11455.73s -> 11460.09s]  Yes.
[11460.09s -> 11465.25s]  Just go get every prize and then go over to the guy and go, hey, can you refill the prizes?
[11465.25s -> 11469.71s]  It's like, how did you glitch this out or like hack this?
[11469.71s -> 11471.91s]  Are you selling these?
[11471.99s -> 11472.99s]  What are you doing?
[11472.99s -> 11476.72s]  All right.
[11476.72s -> 11477.72s]  This could be a double.
[11477.72s -> 11482.42s]  Possible.
[11482.42s -> 11483.42s]  I hit the lip.
[11483.42s -> 11487.28s]  Shit.
[11487.28s -> 11488.28s]  I can do it.
[11488.28s -> 11489.28s]  I just have a handful of prizes.
[11489.28s -> 11491.28s]  There's a five-year-old behind me.
[11491.28s -> 11495.40s]  That's going to happen again.
[11495.40s -> 11496.40s]  It's going to happen again.
[11496.40s -> 11497.40s]  Shit.
[11497.40s -> 11504.59s]  I'm an idiot.
[11504.59s -> 11505.59s]  Oh, yes.
[11505.59s -> 11514.06s]  It still worked.
[11514.06s -> 11515.06s]  Cleaning out my local.
[11515.06s -> 11519.05s]  Whoa.
[11519.05s -> 11521.05s]  Oh, I have this actually in my inventory.
[11521.05s -> 11523.44s]  OK.
[11523.44s -> 11524.44s]  We're going to replace.
[11524.44s -> 11525.44s]  I don't know.
[11525.44s -> 11527.71s]  One of these.
[11527.71s -> 11529.71s]  Just put a health potion in there.
[11529.71s -> 11547.18s]  Put it back in the machine.
[11547.18s -> 11550.85s]  Yeah.
[11551.37s -> 11553.37s]  Why is there booze in this machine?
[11553.37s -> 11563.70s]  There's a bottle of vodka in here.
[11563.70s -> 11566.99s]  Get his arm.
[11566.99s -> 11568.51s]  Yes, I got his arm.
[11568.51s -> 11571.38s]  All three lizards are mine.
[11571.38s -> 11572.38s]  What a deal.
[11572.38s -> 11574.20s]  What's the deal?
[11574.20s -> 11575.63s]  Let's see.
[11575.63s -> 11581.77s]  Look at this image for a hundred million off your extraordinary debt.
[11581.77s -> 11583.13s]  That's too easy.
[11583.13s -> 11588.04s]  I mean, that's too easy.
[11588.04s -> 11592.03s]  Wrong one?
[11592.03s -> 11593.03s]  No.
[11593.03s -> 11594.03s]  New deal.
[11594.03s -> 11598.57s]  When Mr. Green plays gaming games, total is doubled.
[11598.57s -> 11601.65s]  When he plays gambling games, what do you mean?
[11601.65s -> 11602.65s]  That's not...
[11602.65s -> 11603.65s]  Wrong one again.
[11603.65s -> 11607.32s]  Get offer.
[11607.32s -> 11608.32s]  Made you look.
[11608.32s -> 11609.32s]  There are no offers.
[11609.32s -> 11611.72s]  People need to stop spamming links so much these days.
[11611.72s -> 11614.48s]  Play Pathologic and Pathologic 2.
[11614.48s -> 11626.27s]  Time that person out for an hour.
[11626.27s -> 11629.27s]  You got your game shout out.
[11629.27s -> 11642.41s]  I'll have an opportunity.
[11642.41s -> 11645.41s]  Might as well just try to get everything.
[11645.41s -> 11658.32s]  Oh, can I sell these?
[11658.32s -> 11668.97s]  What do I do with them?
[11668.97s -> 11672.05s]  Go do karaoke?
[11672.05s -> 11673.05s]  I will.
[11673.05s -> 11683.32s]  I will.
[11683.32s -> 11686.08s]  Pathologic was one of the most awful games I have ever played.
[11686.08s -> 11687.08s]  Jesus.
[11687.08s -> 11690.43s]  All right, let's go do some other fun toy stuff.
[11690.43s -> 11692.13s]  Can I play this one?
[11692.13s -> 11698.75s]  No.
[11698.75s -> 11709.26s]  What are some of the toys I can play with?
[11709.26s -> 11715.05s]  Hi-tech bowling alley.
[11715.05s -> 11716.05s]  Batting practice.
[11716.05s -> 11725.16s]  Yep.
[11725.16s -> 11730.67s]  Dude, I used to go to the batting cages and just absolutely destroy.
[11730.67s -> 11732.43s]  There'd be a 14-year-old next to me.
[11732.43s -> 11736.83s]  There'd be like an 18-year-old in the other cage and I'd be in the middle and I would
[11736.83s -> 11738.67s]  just be hitting fucking home runs.
[11738.67s -> 11748.07s]  I'd be destroying.
[11748.07s -> 11749.87s]  I would hit the net.
[11749.87s -> 11753.15s]  I would hit the back net in the cages every time.
[11753.15s -> 11765.03s]  Getting a high score coming to cool prizes.
[11765.03s -> 11767.31s]  I don't care about your prizes.
[11767.31s -> 11768.31s]  I care about winning.
[11768.31s -> 11771.88s]  I don't want the prize.
[11771.88s -> 11772.88s]  I just want to win.
[11772.88s -> 11775.33s]  Advanced.
[11775.33s -> 11776.33s]  No, no, let's start easy.
[11776.33s -> 11787.47s]  Let's go to the one that I would go to, the one that just lobs them so you can just...
[11787.47s -> 11795.88s]  You're essentially just chopping wood.
[11795.88s -> 11806.37s]  I'm going to just swing as hard as I can and just break this wooden half.
[11806.41s -> 11807.97s]  I think I would really love that, by the way.
[11807.97s -> 11811.50s]  I probably should have figured out how to play first.
[11811.50s -> 11812.50s]  Oh, no.
[11812.50s -> 11813.50s]  Do I?
[11813.50s -> 11814.50s]  No, I don't.
[11814.50s -> 11815.50s]  That's so loud.
[11815.50s -> 11816.50s]  Holy fuck, that's horrible.
[11816.50s -> 11818.10s]  I got to hold on a minute.
[11818.10s -> 11819.10s]  That actually hurt my head.
[11819.10s -> 11820.10s]  That was painful.
[11820.10s -> 11823.96s]  That's better.
[11823.96s -> 11830.77s]  That's very slow.
[11830.77s -> 11831.77s]  That was very slow.
[11831.77s -> 11834.04s]  I didn't even see it go by.
[11834.04s -> 11835.04s]  Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11835.04s -> 11836.04s]  Let me just do the training first.
[11836.04s -> 11837.04s]  Let me do the training.
[11837.04s -> 11842.95s]  How to play.
[11842.95s -> 11843.95s]  Press A at the right time.
[11843.99s -> 11844.99s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11844.99s -> 11846.71s]  Let me just do the training first.
[11846.71s -> 11847.71s]  Let me do the training.
[11847.71s -> 11851.19s]  Let me do the training.
[11851.19s -> 11852.19s]  How to play.
[11852.19s -> 11857.34s]  Press A at the right timing to hit balls, of course.
[11857.34s -> 11859.35s]  Okay.
[11859.35s -> 11861.87s]  Okay.
[11861.87s -> 11864.96s]  Okay.
[11864.96s -> 11867.93s]  Okay.
[11867.93s -> 11869.68s]  Okay.
[11869.68s -> 11874.57s]  Okay.
[11874.57s -> 11875.57s]  Just ban links.
[11875.57s -> 11876.57s]  They are officially banned.
[11876.57s -> 11880.13s]  All right, let me get this again.
[11880.13s -> 11890.80s]  I don't even hit that that way.
[11890.80s -> 11891.80s]  I hit it backwards.
[11891.80s -> 11903.20s]  How do I hit the ball behind me?
[11903.44s -> 11904.44s]  I'm sitting.
[11904.44s -> 11905.44s]  I'm standing sideways.
[11905.44s -> 11906.44s]  I'm hitting.
[11906.44s -> 11907.44s]  How am I hitting it?
[11907.44s -> 11908.44s]  It doesn't make any sense.
[11908.44s -> 11909.80s]  Oh, he's a real pull hitter.
[11909.80s -> 11917.06s]  It's hard.
[11917.06s -> 11918.06s]  The analog is kind of annoying to hold.
[11918.06s -> 11921.73s]  Don't worry.
[11921.73s -> 11922.73s]  Oh, I can't do it in a video game.
[11922.73s -> 11923.73s]  He can't hit the ball in a video game.
[11923.73s -> 11924.73s]  See me in real life.
[11924.73s -> 11949.59s]  See me in real life when I fucking got a real bat in my hand and I will do, I can do it.
[11949.59s -> 11950.59s]  I just watch.
[11950.59s -> 11951.59s]  I'll prove it.
[11951.59s -> 11952.59s]  I'll do it somewhere.
[11952.59s -> 11953.59s]  I'm going to, I'll do a batting cage to him.
[11953.59s -> 11954.59s]  And you guys are going to be like, holding it.
[11954.59s -> 11955.59s]  I'm going to do it.
[11955.59s -> 11956.59s]  I'm going to do it.
[11956.59s -> 11957.59s]  I'm going to do it.
[11957.59s -> 11958.59s]  I'm going to do it.
[11959.07s -> 11960.97s]  Keep in the cage, Mr.
[11960.97s -> 11961.97s]  And you guys are going to be like, holy shit.
[11961.97s -> 11980.08s]  I take back everything I've ever said about this guy.
[11980.08s -> 12000.40s]  That doesn't happen in real life.
[12000.40s -> 12003.00s]  That doesn't happen in real life.
[12003.00s -> 12006.98s]  Plus, I'm not like standing behind the person actually hitting the ball.
[12006.98s -> 12008.08s]  And It's me hitting the ball.
[12008.08s -> 12009.96s]  Now that wasn't an out.
[12009.96s -> 12034.29s]  That was a ground ball with club kitchen length.
[12034.29s -> 12035.13s]  Am I swinging so early?
[12035.13s -> 12038.05s]  I gotta go to the advanced course.
[12038.05s -> 12039.05s]  That's the problem.
[12039.05s -> 12047.96s]  They're going too slow.
[12047.96s -> 12069.44s]  is that early? I'm about to go buy me. Fuck this game. I'm not done. I'm not done. I'm not done.
[12069.44s -> 12080.77s]  I'm not done. I'm just going to walk up to the cashier. I'm going to pull a wad of hundred dollar
[12080.77s -> 12085.73s]  bills out of my hand and just smash it down on the counter and go, just keep the extra. I don't care.
[12085.73s -> 12108.45s]  Don't let anybody else in here for an hour. Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone. It's so slow.
[12108.61s -> 12128.52s]  Oh, it's gone, gone, gone, gone. Oops.
[12153.38s -> 12158.64s]  The advanced one. I will just hold on. I got to load the bases first.
[12161.43s -> 12171.96s]  We go load the bases up. Fucking stupid thing. A curve ball doesn't go 60 miles per hour. It goes
[12171.96s -> 12190.05s]  like fucking 78. There it is bases loaded. Let's go home run. Let's do it. Fuck you. I didn't see it.
[12190.45s -> 12195.41s]  Why do I? OK, another problem is when you when you're playing baseball, I don't like turn my
[12195.41s -> 12212.36s]  entire body and look at the sky to try to hit a home run. Fuck out of here. Grand slam. I win.
[12222.39s -> 12246.08s]  Double. Let's go home run. No, triple. Oh, go to the casino. I'm doing I like this. I'm having fun
[12246.08s -> 12254.87s]  doing this. I'm doing this first. Do the BDSM side quest. How about you do that? Like in your
[12254.87s -> 12269.44s]  own free time. There it is. All right. Let's load it up. Go for a home run right now. Let's go.
[12269.44s -> 12311.25s]  Fuck it. Oh, what's my record? Oh, shit. You don't have a record. Yes, I do.
[12324.08s -> 12346.71s]  Six points. New record. OK, intermediate. Let's do it. Oh, I see. The thing changes.
[12346.71s -> 12360.93s]  Well, that's dumb. This is going to do it. Back to back jacks.
[12379.99s -> 12388.37s]  Again, get back on this one. Oh, fuck. I wouldn't even look at a ball.
[12400.48s -> 12417.16s]  Bullshit. Sorry. We'll do the hard one. Advanced. We're about to pass the the old record.
[12417.16s -> 12429.84s]  Oh, there is a home run up top. This will be interesting. Let's see if I can get it.
[12434.28s -> 12447.06s]  You have to like look in the sky. This is just not even OK. OK, you have like my eyes are
[12447.06s -> 12455.86s]  tracking the home run thing. You can't. I don't have four sets of eyes. I'm looking at the top
[12455.86s -> 12480.00s]  of the screen. I'm not even paying attention with the pitchers doing. One out. What?
[12480.00s -> 12497.40s]  What the fuck are you talking about? I feel like just like the dad that goes in after the kids are
[12497.40s -> 12504.42s]  in there. That was fun, kids. Let me get in there. Dad gets a bat that's way too short for him,
[12504.42s -> 12508.45s]  way too light, like a tee ball bat. He just wants to get in there and just rip.
[12509.25s -> 12516.50s]  He swings as hard as he can, completely off timing and throws his whole back out.
[12517.22s -> 12521.38s]  Hey kids, hey kids, watch this.
[12524.10s -> 12536.92s]  Stop leading the shots. Well, how would I? There's no travel time.
[12542.98s -> 12548.18s]  There's no travel time. It's only hitscan. Oh, well, what the hell? I'm trying to lead the target.
[12562.02s -> 12566.58s]  Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back. It's gone. A home run.
[12567.30s -> 12579.28s]  Who's that guy? That guy back, back, back, back. All I want is one. All right. What's another fun
[12579.28s -> 12591.16s]  game I can play here? There's another one. It's 500,000 for the gold rush course. Do I want to play?
[12591.88s -> 12620.00s]  Yeah. Oops. What the hell was that? Yeah, let's go. That came in fast. 100,000. Let's go. Go,
[12620.00s -> 12634.39s]  go, go. That wasn't even a baseball. What the hell was that? That was a boomerang.
[12637.14s -> 12651.72s]  It's a boomerang. All right. The last time I'm going to do this and I'm moving. I'm leaving.
[12653.64s -> 12692.12s]  Come on. Yes. All right. This is the crazy one. Got it. That's 150. Let's go. That's 200.
[12701.33s -> 12712.16s]  That one just like hit me right in the forehead. I just swung a full swing and it hit me right in
[12712.16s -> 12726.08s]  the teeth. Whatever. Fuck this. I'm out. What's this one? Five million for the super gold rush
[12726.08s -> 12754.08s]  course. Let's go. Yeah. That's three. That's it. 500,000. All right. Should I leave one more?
[12755.84s -> 12780.10s]  See right now, the guy, this guy is going to break out of this. He's going to, first of all, he's,
[12780.10s -> 12784.74s]  he's going to run. He's inside of the cage. He's going to run as fast as he can into the door
[12784.74s -> 12788.26s]  and open it the wrong way, right? Because he's going to be like, give me the fuck out of here.
[12788.26s -> 12792.26s]  He's going to open it wrong. You need to pull it, not push it. And he's going to, fuck. Give me
[12792.26s -> 12795.62s]  out. Give me out. Give me out. He's going to open the door and just fucking just run and people in
[12795.62s -> 12798.26s]  his way. He's going to fucking shove people out of the way. Just get out of my, please get out of my
[12798.26s -> 12810.92s]  fucking way. And I'm going to hold both middle fingers up to this guy and then leave. And I'm
[12810.92s -> 12818.84s]  just going to run around screaming, taxi, taxi, taxi, give me a taxi. Like five of them are going
[12818.84s -> 12825.32s]  to taxi. Yes. Where would you like to go? Anywhere within a 50 miles out of here.
[12831.48s -> 12851.40s]  And I'll pay you double. Where am I? What am I? Where should I go next? Disco, disco, disco. Oh,
[12851.40s -> 12871.89s]  there's Mahjong. Disco? Erotic video as well. Okay. I'll play Mahjong. Can I mark it? Oh,
[12871.89s -> 12876.45s]  by the way, everybody, we've officially crossed. I've officially been in the game longer. I told
[12876.45s -> 12893.20s]  you I was going to be in longer. Here I am. By one minute. What's this place? Now the batting
[12893.20s -> 12905.46s]  center. I walk into it. What is that? Where am I? Guess I could hit a few balls. Let me do a mission.
[12914.16s -> 12927.30s]  Where's my hideout? Because I kind of want to go there. It's pink dot as the hideout.
[12927.30s -> 12943.97s]  It's not unlocked. Oh, okay. It's him. Oh, it is me. Let's go. Random encounter.
[12944.69s -> 12972.88s]  Play bingo. Well, maybe in a minute. One, two, three, four, punch. I just kicked him right in
[12972.88s -> 12983.46s]  the face. What's the deal with this guy? You attacked me. How would I have a deal when you're
[12983.46s -> 13001.70s]  the one that confronts me? You're the one with the deal. Am I going to stream the game awards?
[13003.20s -> 13016.72s]  Oh, when are they? Yeah. When are they? That's soon, right? 10th? Yeah, sure. If I can. Definitely.
[13018.98s -> 13034.55s]  You're going to get DMCA'd? Will we? Oh, whatever. All this music comes on. It should be fine.
[13044.21s -> 13052.58s]  Oh, yeah. I got to tell him what happened.
[13070.53s -> 13077.12s]  Tell him you lost six million at the baseball game.
[13082.00s -> 13084.72s]  No, you don't tell people that. You don't lead with that.
[13097.00s -> 13102.05s]  You keep that to yourself.
[13102.37s -> 13117.41s]  I love bingo. It goes like so much fun. It really is. It's so easy. You just have to sit there and
[13117.41s -> 13141.64s]  listen and win sometimes. I should head home. Okay. Walk north through the hotel district.
[13150.85s -> 13153.09s]  When you start liking bingo, that's how you know you're getting old.
[13155.40s -> 13170.24s]  You're old. I mean, I liked it before. I did. What the hell is this? Yeah, you seem to think
[13170.24s -> 13181.24s]  you can just walk by me without a word. This dude is huge. I'm not here to show my god.
[13181.96s -> 13191.11s]  So this is a shakedown. You should pick your targets better. I don't have a single yen for
[13191.11s -> 13209.40s]  chumps like you. Mr. Shakedown? That's this guy's name? What the fuck? Does he just grab you and
[13209.40s -> 13232.72s]  take money from your pocket? Oh shit, I just lost $285,000. What? What just happened? You're not
[13232.72s -> 13238.55s]  half bad. I'll let you off the hook this time. What? If I'm having trouble with somebody like
[13238.55s -> 13245.89s]  you, I need to change my training regimen. Time to bump up the intensity. Should I have shaking
[13245.89s -> 13259.14s]  down to do? I'm just Mr. X. Hey, you okay, man? Hey, you just had the misfortune of meeting
[13259.14s -> 13266.05s]  Hiroya Egashira. Mr. Shakedown, they call him. Mr. Shakedown? Yeah, he'll go after anybody that
[13266.05s -> 13270.40s]  crosses his path, and then he takes everything they have. You seem like you can hold your own
[13270.40s -> 13275.81s]  in a fight, but that guy's on a whole different level. If he sets his sights on you, you run for
[13275.81s -> 13284.72s]  it. He takes all your money? I wish somebody could come along and beat all that stolen money out of
[13284.72s -> 13293.76s]  him. Did he get you? Took my whole holiday bonus. I knew I should have made a beeline to the bank
[13293.76s -> 13301.24s]  with it. Next time you're sitting on a stack of cash. Rumor has it he's not the only Mr. Shakedown
[13301.24s -> 13311.24s]  and that they aren't just a kumarucho thing. Stay sharp. If you ever go out of town. Oh, great.
[13311.80s -> 13321.28s]  If you lose to Mr. Shakedown in battle, he'll take all the money you have. If you can beat Mr.
[13321.28s -> 13342.74s]  Shakedown, you reclaim all the money he steals from you. What? Okay, so how do I deposit money?
[13343.30s -> 13362.66s]  Oh, I got a tissue. Oh, just throw it away. You don't. You there. Wait, is it him? Oh, no, no, no,
[13362.74s -> 13376.31s]  no, no, it's just one guy. This is this is this is not Mr. Shakedown. Spend it on abilities, right?
[13376.31s -> 13398.82s]  Yep. Get out of here. You cannot take what you invest. Fuck, I had I had like $12 million.
[13400.18s -> 13408.68s]  God damn it. All right, hold on. Let me take a break. I'm gonna get some water. I'm gonna go pee.
[13408.68s -> 13648.79s]  I'll be back in like two, three minutes. You're back. Here comes artwork. What do we got?
[13650.26s -> 13691.27s]  Do you have the photos? How are they? Right with a gun? More Jojo? No Catboy. Bad ad game.
[13691.27s -> 13712.20s]  No Catboy this time. All right, let's let's continue. I head back to the game. So I am
[13712.20s -> 13715.24s]  going to tell you guys something that I'm probably only going to stream for like another hour.
[13717.19s -> 13728.71s]  At least it was more than four hours. And then I may I'm trying to kind of gauge those who
[13728.71s -> 13737.01s]  that weren't here. I want to make sure people know this. I've been getting sick. As of this
[13737.01s -> 13742.15s]  kind of past weekend, I started like on like Saturday or so Sunday, I started getting a little
[13742.15s -> 13750.55s]  scratchy. And then I'm kind of stuffy. So I took a bunch of precautions. I took a COVID test.
[13751.52s -> 13757.51s]  And I want to really just kind of make sure that I kind of err on the side of complete caution here.
[13757.51s -> 13767.78s]  So I'm sort of awaiting that. I don't have the I don't know. I don't have the results yet.
[13767.78s -> 13777.91s]  So just want to obviously let everybody know that I'm okay. But yeah, that's pretty much it.
[13780.23s -> 13787.41s]  Hey gamers. So tomorrow, I'll the next like probably three or four plus days are going to
[13787.41s -> 13792.61s]  be sort of erratic. I might stream one day and then two days or one day and then one day, one day off,
[13792.61s -> 13803.62s]  one day on. We'll kind of see how it goes. But I'm okay right now. We'll see. Let's go back to the
[13803.62s -> 13826.80s]  game. That was cute. Ratatouille. Adorable. There's no camera. Fuck. Okay, good. The light is on like
[13826.80s -> 13839.75s]  it's being recorded. Breaks me out for a second. So what can I do with this stuff? Just drink the
[13839.75s -> 13856.23s]  milk? That's all it does? Just eat it. Just eat everything. All right, let's go. What was something
[13856.23s -> 13864.18s]  else I could do? I'm going to let me do the quest and let me spend this money. So I don't hold on.
[13864.18s -> 13878.28s]  Yeah. Before I lose it all gambling. Regular attacks and heat actions. Yes. 30 million,
[13880.88s -> 13890.68s]  2 million. A mighty knee from low stance. More health. Oh wait. Reduce the amount of heat loss
[13890.68s -> 13897.92s]  when you take damage. That's pretty good. And reduces the heat dropping over time. Probably
[13897.92s -> 13904.18s]  this one. Should I do more health? I'm doing this one. So you don't lose a lot of heat when you take
[13904.18s -> 13917.81s]  damage. I like it. I like it. Anything else for like 400? Okay. Increase the power of your regular
[13917.81s -> 13932.90s]  attacks. Go to the disco. All right. I will go to the disco right now and then I'm going to do the
[13932.90s -> 13937.17s]  mission or vice versa. All right. I'm going to do the mission and then I'm going to do the disco.
[13937.17s -> 13965.73s]  I'm going to change my clothes. Karaoke. Karaoke. Karaoke. Maybe soon. Maybe. Look at my eye.
[13968.71s -> 13989.32s]  I can change clothes in here, right? I can put the clown outfit on. Hold on. Get out of my eye.
[13995.97s -> 13999.46s]  Oh damn it. I'm going to laugh every time I see it.
[14007.54s -> 14009.52s]  Hey grab me a couple cigarettes out of the fridge.
[14009.76s -> 14017.17s]  That's both for you. What about me? What the fuck?
[14031.62s -> 14038.07s]  Oh beer.
[14038.47s -> 14051.24s]  Weirdly cluttered. The table is, you got a lot of real estate. Not using a whole lot of it.
[14067.76s -> 14074.88s]  Thank you so much for not being obnoxious and talking through all the cutscenes.
[14075.84s -> 14079.04s]  Thank you so much for not being obnoxious and talking through all the cutscenes like you did
[14079.04s -> 14090.79s]  last time. Did I? I think I'm doing that. I'm doing that right now. Fuck. All right. I'll be quiet.
[14091.11s -> 14098.53s]  Be quiet.
[14117.59s -> 14127.83s]  You can talk? Did this guy not eat? Why are there... What are those bottles over there?
[14128.39s -> 14129.83s]  There's like four bottles on the table.
[14129.83s -> 14135.54s]  I want to that one's gonna eat
[14145.02s -> 14148.35s]  I'll turn it up
[14149.55s -> 14154.72s]  There's ramen on the table. Yeah, we're playing poker with Oreos. He's lost every single round
[14155.24s -> 14161.67s]  We're not old enough to play with money. So we use chips Oreos sticks and food pieces
[14175.73s -> 14178.60s]  Oh
[14189.09s -> 14191.09s]  There are beers on the table
[14213.97s -> 14215.97s]  They're unopened right
[14217.47s -> 14219.47s]  I

[14466.74s -> 14467.78s]  I mean
[14467.78s -> 14469.86s]  I don't I guess I can kind of
[14471.27s -> 14473.27s]  Sort of see that
[14474.13s -> 14476.37s]  But not in their voice. I mean

[14487.68s -> 14490.65s]  Enjoy your time at the maharaja
[14496.02s -> 14501.86s]  Although saw would have probably been a lot more interesting. I guess with Christopher Walken as saw would have been weird
[14504.64s -> 14512.66s]  What can I do?
[14512.66s -> 14517.54s]  These dance moves
[14517.54s -> 14519.54s]  This is like i'm playing in a puddle

[16190.90s -> 16194.26s]  So what say we pay him back by sucker punching this crazy bitch for him?
[16195.06s -> 16200.02s]  You hear that boy those dim bulbs are planning on getting the drop on a little lady from behind
[16201.38s -> 16203.88s]  Sounds that way
[16203.88s -> 16208.04s]  Lovely crowd. They're a perfect match for the sort of scum that'll pull a knife on a woman
[16208.68s -> 16212.08s]  Why don't you give me a little demo of what a man's supposed to be?
[16212.80s -> 16217.25s]  And no saying this doesn't involve you this time. Yeah
[16218.15s -> 16224.24s]  Yeah, I wouldn't she can clearly defend herself there's a whole pack of them i'm jumping in
[16225.75s -> 16230.55s]  Yes, that's my boy keeping chivalry alive and working in a fine bit of training in the process
[16232.63s -> 16236.02s]  The hell do you want?
[16236.02s -> 16237.06s]  Good
[16237.06s -> 16241.59s]  I guess planning a sucker punch that woman in the back. You got an eavesdropping problem
[16242.23s -> 16252.07s]  Damn straight. We are is it a robot? It shouldn't be what the robot? That should not be a robot. Why is it a robot?
[16253.52s -> 16260.10s]  What it doesn't know hold on a second what that's not what it's supposed to be sounding like let me see
[16260.58s -> 16265.73s]  No, what the fuck that's not supposed to sound like that. It's supposed to sound why is it? Why is it? Okay?
[16265.73s -> 16269.57s]  There we go. What the fuck it was supposed to be like that. Okay
[16276.42s -> 16278.58s]  You think I want that psycho bitch to see me coming
[16279.14s -> 16281.30s]  We'll drop her before she can get those claws out
[16281.78s -> 16286.74s]  I don't care how tough she is. You don't hit a woman and needing a group to do it. It's just pathetic
[16287.38s -> 16289.38s]  You call yourselves men
[16289.38s -> 16293.62s]  What the fuck did you say you got a big mouth and a death wish bell yo
[16294.26s -> 16296.50s]  We're dropping this guy before we take care of the broad
[16299.03s -> 16300.47s]  Oh, is that so?
[16300.47s -> 16307.11s]  Switch to beast style
[16307.11s -> 16311.59s]  You can switch to be style by pressing right by changing to be style now. Okay, let's try it
[16312.55s -> 16317.99s]  Press x while near a large weapon showing a mark to automatically pick it up and swing it. This is called an auto weapon attack
[16318.87s -> 16320.87s]  Bash an enemy with an auto weapon attack. Okay
[16336.58s -> 16339.08s]  Yeah
[16339.08s -> 16343.43s]  Where is it a huge weapon? Where is it?
[16346.52s -> 16355.04s]  Oh use x get out of here use x. Oh, that's not a beast weapon
[16371.22s -> 16374.93s]  All right, is there anything else bigger
[16377.20s -> 16379.20s]  withstand the enemy attacks
[16380.37s -> 16383.33s]  Holding lp to guard lets you withstand enemy attacks with the resist guard
[16383.81s -> 16387.49s]  You'll take a certain amount of damage, but you are protected against attacks from any direction. That's cool
[16388.53s -> 16394.60s]  Okay
[16394.60s -> 16397.00s]  Use beast style moves to pulverize the back
[16397.89s -> 16400.58s]  Pack of power
[16400.66s -> 16402.66s]  Dodge roll now, that's cool
[16419.91s -> 16422.98s]  Nice drop kick
[16423.46s -> 16425.30s]  I'm so fucking mad
[16425.30s -> 16431.14s]  And pick him up by their legs. Oh, that's so awesome
[16441.20s -> 16447.81s]  What is this guy all of us beating on him and it's like he doesn't even feel it you want more
[16449.73s -> 16452.53s]  No, i'm leaving i'm not leaving till at least I punch that bitch
[16453.33s -> 16454.29s]  All right
[16454.29s -> 16458.00s]  Well, i've hold on
[16458.88s -> 16460.32s]  Well, if it isn't
[16460.32s -> 16463.28s]  Porky's little friends. I saw you boys crawling the bar last night
[16464.66s -> 16469.27s]  Uh, I must be hearing things because it sounded like you said something about punching
[16469.99s -> 16472.63s]  Me out if you're interested. This bitch is ready to go
[16474.07s -> 16477.59s]  No, no, no me. I'm just that's just crazy. What kind of man would do that?
[16478.55s -> 16480.55s]  And with a group that's pathetic
[16483.12s -> 16486.56s]  Right now pick up that sad sack line over there and get the hell out of my sight
[16488.45s -> 16490.85s]  I got what I came here for got no use for him now
[16492.68s -> 16497.57s]  Yes, ma'am
[16497.57s -> 16499.57s]  Mr. Satan. No, it's not
[16500.88s -> 16510.34s]  Nothing. Everything that is low is not. Mr. Satan. Is it? It's not everything. It's not. Mr. Satan
[16511.06s -> 16513.06s]  This is not. Mr. Satan
[16514.28s -> 16516.60s]  This is this is uh, you know, yeah
[16517.32s -> 16521.00s]  It's like a hidden camera tv show where they got the person completely blacked out with a silhouette
[16521.89s -> 16527.25s]  Yeah, when I uh, you know that the crazy part is when I watched him when we're working at mcdonald's
[16528.13s -> 16531.27s]  Yeah, he uh, no, it's even lower. It's like yeah
[16533.56s -> 16536.88s]  My identity needs to be taken care of because I watched him
[16536.88s -> 16542.21s]  I watched him pee into the coffee machine and it was disgusting and we tried to make him stop
[16542.21s -> 16550.20s]  We tried to get rid of him. It's a boss was just crazy. He was just fucking fucked up
[16552.44s -> 16553.88s]  Arthur
[16553.88s -> 16561.43s]  I want you to know something Arthur. I do believe it me. I don't know what you're saying
[16562.77s -> 16565.57s]  I'm not doing this again. No, we're not doing this again. I'd rather do this
[16566.92s -> 16570.04s]  What is this bit there is no bit you've already seen it before
[16572.02s -> 16576.74s]  It returns it returns. It's time to go back into this bit
[16577.22s -> 16592.37s]  If you remember this one from a few months ago go. How do I get back to the game? I need a new trailer
[16597.06s -> 16600.08s]  Yeah
[16600.08s -> 16604.48s]  It's groundhog day. No, i'm not that we don't repeat material here
[16605.59s -> 16608.55s]  Except almost every day we do but you know, whatever
[16609.19s -> 16614.98s]  Hmm
[16614.98s -> 16617.60s]  Names kiru
[16617.60s -> 16619.14s]  Kiru, huh?
[16619.14s -> 16621.14s]  I'll remember the name if you've got
[16621.38s -> 16624.34s]  Bacchus singing your praises. You've got to be pretty tough. Yes
[16625.51s -> 16629.03s]  Yes, this boy is a future champion. Let's take my career on it
[16630.05s -> 16635.01s]  Oh, okay. Now i'm seeing what this is you're thinking kiru here is your ticket to a fat stack of cash
[16635.49s -> 16637.97s]  Which then you'll use to pay me back so we can get to stay friends
[16639.27s -> 16640.71s]  Easy tiger
[16640.71s -> 16644.31s]  I told you it'll take a while, but you'll get it back. Oh speaking of favors
[16645.03s -> 16647.03s]  Why don't you train the boy here?
[16649.19s -> 16652.71s]  Wait, well, this is like a table read for a tv show. I'm not even getting into this
[16655.43s -> 16657.91s]  The actor is not even doing the voice. They're doing like the halfway
[16659.96s -> 16661.96s]  Table read youtube video
[16664.45s -> 16667.65s]  Do I seem like the patient teacher and then they all they all laugh too
[16668.37s -> 16670.93s]  After like funny lines, even though they're saying i'm like on a halfway
[16672.31s -> 16673.62s]  Now
[16673.62s -> 16676.82s]  Ah, don't be like that. We both need him to get stronger
[16678.74s -> 16681.46s]  Everyone starts laughing and we're like they all have glasses on too
[16682.02s -> 16684.02s]  Every single person at the table has glasses on
[16684.50s -> 16688.79s]  We'll be rolling in dough besides. I know you're secretly the doting type
[16689.59s -> 16696.07s]  He'll make a champion a hell of a lot faster with you beating him into shape. That means you get paid sooner. Hmm
[16696.23s -> 16698.88s]  See win-win
[16698.88s -> 16703.88s]  What focus?
[16703.88s -> 16705.88s]  What do you think you're doing here, man? Yeah
[16707.25s -> 16709.83s]  Negotiating an apprenticeship with miss tatsu for you
[16715.68s -> 16717.68s]  Sorry, sorry
[16717.92s -> 16723.73s]  Obviously, trust me you train under her. You'll be master of the ring in no time flat
[16724.69s -> 16731.41s]  Uh, you're insane. I'm in seriously in hot water right now. I don't have the time to humor your little fantasies
[16732.69s -> 16733.73s]  What?
[16733.73s -> 16735.73s]  You're at hot water too. My boy
[16736.69s -> 16738.77s]  This is great. This is great
[16739.89s -> 16742.77s]  Are we talking knife in the ribs here? Because I warned you about that
[16743.65s -> 16748.72s]  I'll be lucky if that's all I get and seriously, what's this obsession with me getting stabbed about?
[16750.98s -> 16755.22s]  All right chuckle heads. That's enough. Neither of one of you is making a damn bit of sense
[16757.24s -> 16764.20s]  Here you walks from stage left into the scene and get swarmed by 25 enemies. Oh shit
[16767.08s -> 16773.24s]  But I hear where you're coming from focus ditch the championship talk and just say you care about this kiro kid
[16774.04s -> 16776.66s]  If you're worried about him own it
[16781.04s -> 16783.84s]  Look, you did me a solid minute ago. What was what's on the floor over there?
[16785.09s -> 16787.27s]  Oh, this is trash
[16787.35s -> 16790.07s]  The old man is right that my training will make a real man out of you
[16792.45s -> 16795.33s]  Hop a cab out to the pier sometime. I'll give you a training space there
[16796.61s -> 16798.37s]  You train at the pier
[16798.37s -> 16801.49s]  You got it kind of live that i'm holding this paper still
[16802.21s -> 16805.33s]  Put down pay me a visit sometime see for yourself. I think you'll get the digs
[16806.21s -> 16811.60s]  Everyone looks over at me. What the what do yeah, i've memorized the lines already. I don't need the fucking paper anymore
[16812.32s -> 16815.68s]  All you guys that show up like three days before we hurt rehearsal. No, fuck all of you
[16825.70s -> 16830.82s]  Focus i've already got a future plan. I'm sorry, but I can't be your champion. What sport are we even talking about boxing?
[16831.54s -> 16833.46s]  Not that it matters. I can't
[16833.46s -> 16836.60s]  It's a toxic theater kid
[16843.12s -> 16845.36s]  I know that doesn't mean i'll stop trying
[16846.00s -> 16850.58s]  But I know i'll just stop making a nuisance of myself. I'll give you some spice jump
[16851.06s -> 16854.50s]  It's about time for my afternoon drink. Anyway, help me clear my head
[16856.05s -> 16858.05s]  Good luck with that. Just don't have too many
[16859.01s -> 16862.13s]  Do you think a guy called bakas can't hold his wine?
[16862.61s -> 16866.82s]  Ha see you around boy and keep those ribs knife free
[16867.78s -> 16870.88s]  Get out of here. Thanks. I'll be careful
[16874.72s -> 16878.31s]  I will thank you for hanging out with me
[16879.03s -> 16885.25s]  This afternoon didn't expect to get wrapped up in that mess, but at least I didn't come away empty-handed
[16893.32s -> 16895.32s]  That is torn on who that is
[16897.51s -> 16905.19s]  British bernie sanders. I mean like boris johnson kind of is like sounds like that british bernie
[16917.00s -> 16920.55s]  What's going on this is a rough looking crowd
[16921.35s -> 16927.52s]  What do I ever do for this guy?
[16927.52s -> 16929.75s]  uh
[16929.75s -> 16931.11s]  Oi, um
[16931.11s -> 16932.47s]  Oi. Oi
[16932.47s -> 16934.47s]  I'm so freaking stoked man
[16935.51s -> 16938.63s]  Oh rare street show, but you're gonna meet your silvers
[16940.07s -> 16942.95s]  Too right those guys are rock and roll boards
[16943.75s -> 16945.75s]  Look at this bitching crowd
[16945.83s -> 16950.23s]  They drew all these punks without any ads or any nothing at all
[16951.03s -> 16953.03s]  crazy, it's crazy
[16953.19s -> 16961.62s]  I think this looks like a street documentary voice. It's not documentary voice
[16964.69s -> 16966.69s]  They're all boris johnson
[16967.33s -> 16973.16s]  It's not nigel thornberry. What?
[16976.21s -> 16979.41s]  How do you get boris johnson and nigel thornberry mixed up?
[16983.38s -> 16987.78s]  Keep your pants on but I heard the yokomichi silvers are heading for a q and a panel
[16989.20s -> 16993.36s]  No effing way. They're famous for never saying a word and letting their music do the talking
[16993.92s -> 16995.92s]  I wonder what the hell they're talking about
[16996.40s -> 17004.34s]  Sounds like some band's doing an event here
[17004.76s -> 17006.76s]  Must be popular with the local punks
[17007.41s -> 17013.56s]  hmm
[17013.56s -> 17015.80s]  Oops, wait, can you it's coming through twice?
[17016.76s -> 17021.25s]  It might no no
[17021.25s -> 17023.01s]  theater square
[17023.01s -> 17024.21s]  All right, so
[17024.21s -> 17025.41s]  Save the game
[17025.41s -> 17029.00s]  Oh, there's a quest marker over here quest quest quest
[17031.27s -> 17033.27s]  Uh, you didn't see me do that
[17034.56s -> 17038.40s]  Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Look at these people. Holy cow. What are we going to do?
[17039.92s -> 17041.92s]  Oi, hey you
[17042.08s -> 17043.84s]  Yikes
[17044.08s -> 17049.60s]  Gee whiz pal. I never peed. I didn't peepee my pants. What are you doing chuffing around behind me? You ugly knob
[17051.08s -> 17053.08s]  Oh, yeah, sorry
[17053.16s -> 17056.68s]  All right, but I should apologize for bumping into you earlier
[17058.45s -> 17059.89s]  oh
[17059.89s -> 17070.26s]  You're that man
[17070.26s -> 17073.38s]  I love so much. Oh everybody fucking hates this
[17075.11s -> 17077.11s]  It's giving me energy right now
[17079.86s -> 17086.45s]  Uh, sure
[17086.45s -> 17088.77s]  Wait a second. Could you possibly be unaware of who I am?
[17089.25s -> 17094.92s]  Yeah, uh, are you asking me if we met before if we bumped into each other if we did I don't recognize you
[17098.39s -> 17101.99s]  Oh, wait a second then so you really don't know who I am. Oh willikers. What a relief
[17103.67s -> 17110.23s]  I'm so sorry. I was rude. Don't not too true. My name's kyo. My stage name is crazy kyo. I'm the vocalist in a band
[17111.03s -> 17116.21s]  Let me guess the yoke meet you silvers
[17119.16s -> 17122.68s]  Same band these young punks are excited to see aren't you guys some kind of legendary?
[17123.24s -> 17124.84s]  yankee band
[17124.84s -> 17129.32s]  I'm gonna chat just gave you a hundred dollars to fuck off
[17130.64s -> 17133.46s]  What I don't read bits anymore
[17133.70s -> 17140.07s]  He's a jerk. The lemmy gave a hundred bucks jerma. I will pay you to never do this voice ever again
[17140.15s -> 17142.15s]  Well, you did it before I agreed to that
[17143.78s -> 17148.42s]  So now i'm going to read your message in the voice that you didn't want that you paid to stop
[17163.72s -> 17169.96s]  He's a scumbag no, thanks. You can't pay me to do anything. I'll never accept money to do something. I'm never requiring
[17175.51s -> 17182.42s]  90
[17182.42s -> 17184.42s]  Even hardcore in the slightest
[17184.42s -> 17187.62s]  No, as a joke, we tried dressing all punk at a show to our shock
[17187.62s -> 17191.86s]  We got pretty popular with the yankee crowd, but now we have to keep up this charade full time
[17192.74s -> 17199.17s]  Every time we gained a fan base of wannabe punks and the yoke go meet you silvers became heroes to the rebellious youth of japan
[17199.41s -> 17201.41s]  Little style is called yankee now
[17202.52s -> 17203.81s]  Okay
[17203.81s -> 17205.81s]  There's more to running a band than I thought
[17206.79s -> 17208.79s]  So what do you mean by me saving you?
[17209.19s -> 17213.96s]  I um actually now I know this game's 80 hours long. I figured it out
[17214.60s -> 17217.46s]  I see
[17217.46s -> 17219.86s]  I want you to teach me how to be a hardcore hooligan
[17222.24s -> 17224.24s]  Teach you to be a yankee
[17224.77s -> 17228.29s]  Yes, you see for today's event. We also have to do a live panel
[17228.93s -> 17230.93s]  a meet-and-greet for the fans
[17231.68s -> 17238.00s]  Every member of the yokimichi silvers myself included are law-abiding choir boys. We've never even shoplifted
[17238.96s -> 17244.82s]  If we were to talk in front of the real yankee, they'd realize that we're phonies
[17245.46s -> 17249.70s]  Fake punks. Eh now that you mentioned it the way you talk doesn't match how you dress at all
[17253.01s -> 17259.09s]  You are a choir boy, right? So if we spoke to our fans, we'd lose all our credibility and popularity in an instant
[17260.29s -> 17262.45s]  Or worse, what if they want revenge on us for fooling them?
[17268.04s -> 17270.36s]  Okay, but do you have to do this panel thing? Why don't you just skip it?
[17271.81s -> 17274.29s]  I don't want to do it either but our agency says we need to hone
[17274.93s -> 17277.81s]  Our speaking skills. We want to stay popular. They're making us do this
[17278.61s -> 17285.88s]  Are you know when you're in line for the ride at like disney world or universal studios?
[17287.06s -> 17289.38s]  And you're just sitting there in line watching the videos
[17291.09s -> 17294.13s]  It's like an hour and a half watching the videos in line
[17295.72s -> 17299.32s]  And then you get onto the ride and the ride is like three minutes long
[17300.28s -> 17304.68s]  And you're like, holy shit. That was fun. And then you kind of get in line for another ride and you watch the videos again
[17305.48s -> 17309.80s]  I feel like this is this game
[17309.80s -> 17313.40s]  Like i'm in line at the ride and then when we actually fight people
[17314.77s -> 17317.65s]  Like I get to be on fucking back to the future for two minutes
[17318.37s -> 17327.59s]  So you want me to teach you how to behave like a yankee?
[17331.56s -> 17333.56s]  He hates it. No, I don't
[17333.64s -> 17341.73s]  I don't
[17341.73s -> 17343.49s]  I don't hate this
[17343.49s -> 17350.80s]  When did I say I hated the back to the future of ride line experience? I never said that
[17351.68s -> 17356.29s]  I just said that's what it reminds me of
[17356.61s -> 17364.69s]  You implied it. No, I didn't I said this, you know, you know, you know, this reminds me of
[17365.49s -> 17369.84s]  You can teach us. Okay, teach me how to be don't
[17377.11s -> 17379.11s]  He hates back to the future. This is not
[17379.51s -> 17382.52s]  How much do you like lines then?
[17385.03s -> 17387.51s]  in simulator
[17387.51s -> 17389.51s]  You heavily implied it
[17390.84s -> 17393.16s]  Do you love to watch the theme park videos before the ride?
[17393.16s -> 17397.56s]  Yes, I do because it fills me in and I get to see stuff that I've never seen before
[17398.28s -> 17400.92s]  That's content. You don't get to see unless you go to the ride
[17401.80s -> 17407.49s]  Or I mean maybe like on like the special features of the dvd. They might put it on there
[17408.13s -> 17416.95s]  All right, let's do it
[17417.19s -> 17427.28s]  Okie dokie
[17427.28s -> 17429.35s]  Give me a second, please
[17429.35s -> 17431.20s]  Okay
[17431.20s -> 17432.16s]  You're back
[17432.16s -> 17433.60s]  Sorry to keep you waiting
[17433.60s -> 17441.25s]  This is our drummer sleazy tarashi
[17445.00s -> 17446.60s]  Hey, i'm tarashi
[17446.60s -> 17450.20s]  My stage name is sleazy, but I have no experience with the ladies never even seen a boo
[17451.33s -> 17453.33s]  This is our bassist bad boy aku
[17453.97s -> 17458.20s]  I'm aku hobbies caring for elders
[17458.68s -> 17460.36s]  This is kirusan
[17460.36s -> 17464.28s]  Is going to impart the ways of true yankee style hooliganism onto us
[17465.24s -> 17466.92s]  Please teach us
[17466.92s -> 17468.20s]  Okay
[17468.20s -> 17472.39s]  You guys are so polite and proper. I'm starting to wonder if there's anything I can do for you
[17473.19s -> 17478.44s]  Oh, no, please don't say that. We're all pretty good guys at heart. So please help us
[17479.32s -> 17482.32s]  In your case being pretty good at guys is the problem
[17483.54s -> 17486.18s]  I did agree to this. So somehow am I gonna beat this shit out of them?
[17487.84s -> 17500.42s]  How can I show you how to be tougher? Maybe you could come up with an opening remark for a little old me
[17501.30s -> 17502.85s]  Okay
[17502.85s -> 17508.15s]  I want to kick off our panel with authority being hooligans. We shouldn't come across as weak or hesitant
[17508.87s -> 17511.33s]  I need a zinger
[17511.33s -> 17515.54s]  Dearly beloved we're gathered here today start your engines. Hello, but in english
[17516.58s -> 17519.78s]  What opening with hello, but it's in english
[17521.03s -> 17523.03s]  English do you really think so?
[17523.80s -> 17526.84s]  I mean a hooligan speaking english. Is that is that yankee style?
[17527.48s -> 17533.57s]  I think it would be just right for a yankee young rebels fall hard for what's cool and english is the language of rock and roll
[17535.78s -> 17536.90s]  Okay
[17536.90s -> 17541.54s]  Think about it their hero the vocalist of the yokomichi silver speaks a language. They don't know
[17542.26s -> 17544.42s]  They can't help but be impressed by his worldiness
[17545.22s -> 17548.48s]  Do I have to keep speaking english afterwards?
[17549.04s -> 17551.52s]  That's going to be a challenge. I only know a few greetings
[17553.41s -> 17556.85s]  Same goes for them though. If you sound like you know what you're saying you can get away with it
[17557.49s -> 17561.25s]  Do we get to watch this?
[17561.25s -> 17565.11s]  Rock and roll
[17565.11s -> 17569.80s]  What is it? Well the agency told me to tell the fans about how I spend my days off
[17570.28s -> 17572.28s]  When i'm not rehearsing or performing
[17573.08s -> 17577.16s]  Days off, huh? Makes sense that fans would want to know their heroes live from day to day
[17578.12s -> 17579.80s]  How the heroes live?
[17579.80s -> 17581.80s]  Terashi, how would you spend a day off?
[17582.92s -> 17586.60s]  I make a habit of getting up bright and early so I can make some pancakes after breakfast
[17586.60s -> 17590.44s]  I take my darling puppy chibi chan to the park for a mid-morning stroll
[17591.40s -> 17593.64s]  And then we have lunch at
[17593.64s -> 17599.16s]  Chick cafe to rest our feet on our way home. We do little window shopping after that. I binge on the dramas
[17600.04s -> 17602.04s]  I've got this is when I like make my phone
[17602.68s -> 17604.68s]  Do a fucking ringtone
[17605.00s -> 17608.04s]  And be like, oh, yeah. Yeah. All right. Okay. I gotta I gotta take this see you later guys
[17609.40s -> 17612.08s]  You just described a typical girl's day
[17614.64s -> 17616.32s]  Oh, sorry
[17616.32s -> 17620.24s]  That really made you sound like a fashionable young woman. I was so surprised. I got intense
[17620.72s -> 17624.40s]  Uh, I'm so scared
[17625.60s -> 17631.28s]  Oh, no, kira-san. You shouldn't shout like that. You made sleazy terashi cry. That's a bit much. Don't you think?
[17634.05s -> 17636.05s]  Oh dear sniffle
[17636.69s -> 17641.73s]  Should say sorry
[17641.73s -> 17643.96s]  Yeah, my bad
[17643.96s -> 17647.56s]  It's it's all right. I was just startled. I wasn't expecting it is all
[17648.90s -> 17652.20s]  Sniffles, so how about I spend a day off? How should I spend it? How should I do it?
[17653.64s -> 17655.64s]  It's kind of sound like butt head right there
[17659.78s -> 17662.50s]  One thing's clear. You can't tell the fans how you really spend your free time
[17663.22s -> 17666.48s]  No, I guess not. But then what should I say?
[17667.12s -> 17672.28s]  What would I be doing instead?
[17672.28s -> 17674.28s]  You'd be you'd be hanging with mates
[17675.00s -> 17683.33s]  And you just have to say you spend it having fun with your friends
[17683.97s -> 17688.56s]  I think all my friends that's kind of ordinary, isn't it? I mean, I already do that pretty regularly
[17689.60s -> 17692.72s]  Think about it punks are people too on their days off
[17693.28s -> 17697.04s]  Even they would want to spend it with their friends ever notice them squatting together in parking lots
[17697.52s -> 17703.41s]  Uh, that's true. I see them loitering around like you say, but are they really friends?
[17705.64s -> 17707.64s]  Oh, I used the wrong word
[17707.64s -> 17709.08s]  Isn't wrong
[17709.08s -> 17712.21s]  They're not friends. It should be mates
[17712.88s -> 17715.04s]  Mates actually when you put what people running
[17718.23s -> 17720.95s]  You see on your days off you hang out with your mates
[17723.60s -> 17727.12s]  Actually you and your mates just shoot the shit with each other say that and you'll be fine
[17728.00s -> 17732.96s]  I kind of get it. I'm not sure what that actually means but hanging out with mates sounds totally what hooligans would do
[17735.28s -> 17737.59s]  Now, what do you want?
[17737.59s -> 17740.07s]  You're a bad boy aku, right? What's the matter?
[17740.87s -> 17743.36s]  What should I say?
[17743.36s -> 17745.70s]  Uh, you didn't get a topic like tarashi
[17746.40s -> 17748.05s]  No
[17748.05s -> 17750.37s]  The agency told him to wing it. He's free to talk about whatever
[17751.41s -> 17753.41s]  Even though he's practically mute
[17754.12s -> 17759.64s]  Bad boy aku even has a backstory locked up in juvenile reformatories from birth bad boy
[17759.64s -> 17762.52s]  Aku crushed packs of punks before he even finished preschool
[17763.08s -> 17764.71s]  Mmm
[17764.71s -> 17767.27s]  Your agency's trying to fit a square peg in a round hole
[17767.99s -> 17772.84s]  Man, a few words the crazy backstory. What should he talk about to make him sound hardcore?
[17777.28s -> 17778.40s]  Nothing at all
[17778.40s -> 17784.04s]  Anything be better if you just stay quiet
[17785.36s -> 17789.60s]  Stay silent during the panel wouldn't a discussion without any talking be a disaster
[17791.43s -> 17796.31s]  Nope aku was told he's free to talk about whatever he wants. That means he's also free not to talk at all
[17797.19s -> 17799.70s]  that's true, but
[17799.70s -> 17802.42s]  It would be worse if he were to say the wrong things and wreck his image
[17803.22s -> 17806.66s]  From aku's backstory, I think he would seem more hardcore if he kept his mouth shut
[17808.10s -> 17814.36s]  Yeah, you put it that way it makes total sense. Okay, we'll do that bad boy aku stay speechless during his part
[17817.88s -> 17821.70s]  I can't get over it sure aku. Are you good with that?
[17822.34s -> 17825.27s]  Okay. All right
[17825.27s -> 17827.88s]  Now we'll go over how you'll run this panel discussion
[17830.47s -> 17833.75s]  Yes, please
[17833.75s -> 17835.19s]  Oh, here we go
[17835.19s -> 17846.24s]  We're almost ready for your panel
[17846.24s -> 17848.24s]  I'll be watching from the audience. Let's see how we do
[17849.43s -> 17852.87s]  Yes, please watch us we're going to hit this hardcore yankee thing out of the park
[17853.91s -> 17856.40s]  We're gonna kick ass and stuff. Mm-hmm
[17858.63s -> 17859.83s]  All right, let's see it
[17859.83s -> 17862.93s]  Yeah, they are put your hands together for the yoko bichi silvers
[17869.43s -> 17871.43s]  Ooh crazy kyo san
[17872.15s -> 17878.87s]  Bad boy aku over here. Oh my god. Check out crazy kyo sans original esp guitar smoking red
[17879.51s -> 17881.51s]  The man's got the yankee look nailed
[17883.80s -> 17888.20s]  Oh, they are popular and they're not talking they do look like real greasers
[17890.63s -> 17893.11s]  Sopping wet high rock and roll after school
[17893.67s -> 17895.67s]  Tarashi aku hit it boys
[17904.21s -> 17906.85s]  That concludes what?
[17906.85s -> 17909.25s]  That concludes today's performance by the yoki bichi silvers
[17910.05s -> 17914.45s]  Just listening to their songs. I can see why yankee kids across japan look up to crazy kyo's band
[17915.25s -> 17919.57s]  We'd like to move on to a special meet and greet panel discussion with the band members

[17954.88s -> 17958.24s]  My god that totally authentic pronunciation. It drives me wild

[17974.32s -> 17977.65s]  Awesome. Thank you crazy kyo-san
[17977.73s -> 17981.73s]  Next we would like to hear from sleazy tarashi-san and the bad boy aku-san as well
[17982.45s -> 17987.99s]  First up sleazy tarashi-san. Here's a question. We got from a fan. How do you usually spend your days off?
[17989.68s -> 17993.20s]  Ah, if I get a day off, I mostly hang with my mates and we shoot the shit
[17994.92s -> 17997.80s]  Yeah, a guy like tarashi-san must have a lot of mates
[17998.76s -> 18001.08s]  Tarashi-san, what do you do with your mates?
[18002.56s -> 18004.00s]  um
[18004.00s -> 18006.16s]  We uh make pancakes is no
[18008.08s -> 18016.18s]  You ruined it. Oh, we don't just stay holed up at home. We go out and uh eat lunch at fancy cafes and stuff. Yeah
[18016.90s -> 18019.76s]  Who the fuck is this guy?
[18019.76s -> 18022.02s]  Uh, oh
[18022.02s -> 18024.02s]  I should have covered more details
[18025.44s -> 18027.73s]  Oh, no
[18027.73s -> 18030.05s]  I have a bad boy aku-san to say something
[18037.43s -> 18040.82s]  Uh, don't say anything
[18043.78s -> 18046.76s]  That was it
[18046.76s -> 18050.44s]  No way. He just stood there for his whole panel discussion. That's
[18051.70s -> 18053.70s]  That's so hardcore
[18054.96s -> 18056.48s]  Yeah
[18056.48s -> 18062.16s]  Holy crap bad boy aku-san's the coolest. What a rebel. He doesn't play by the rules. Not even his own rules
[18062.16s -> 18064.16s]  That's what makes him a bad boy
[18064.72s -> 18068.23s]  I'm good. It was the right choice
[18068.23s -> 18071.59s]  After all it doesn't take a big talk to make a big man and attitude speaks louder than words
[18073.70s -> 18074.82s]  Did I do it?
[18074.82s -> 18086.02s]  Here's n were you watching?
[18086.66s -> 18088.42s]  Yeah, I saw everything
[18088.42s -> 18090.44s]  Good work
[18090.44s -> 18093.88s]  Here's n we tried to apply what we learned from you about the ways of the yankee to our panel
[18095.00s -> 18098.68s]  Fan response is pretty darn good. I'm kind of shocked. Do I get money for this?
[18100.68s -> 18102.68s]  It seemed that way. It was all worth the effort
[18103.16s -> 18105.00s]  I think we can keep the yochi
[18105.00s -> 18109.88s]  Yokomitsu silver is going without stay of sagging. They're gonna be still we're gonna be fine
[18110.60s -> 18112.12s]  Thank you very much
[18112.12s -> 18114.12s]  You got a charismatic autobiography
[18114.92s -> 18117.86s]  That's the most fun i've ever had speaking in public
[18118.98s -> 18124.18s]  Here son. Thanks from now on we're going to keep working hard to expand on what you taught us about the way of the yankee
[18124.90s -> 18127.84s]  We'll work on our speaking skills, too
[18128.16s -> 18133.22s]  Keep an eye on us
[18133.22s -> 18136.34s]  The yoko michi silvers are going places. Just you watch
[18136.98s -> 18140.82s]  Yeah, give it your best shot
[18140.82s -> 18144.90s]  Do not equip the book. Please do not use the book. Don't use the book. Don't equip the book
[18144.90s -> 18147.06s]  Don't do throw the book in the trash. What's going on here?
[18147.70s -> 18154.42s]  People sure have all kinds of challenges to face
[18154.66s -> 18162.82s]  At least those guys are diligent they should survive the rough road of the entertainment world somehow don't give up guys
[18165.41s -> 18172.34s]  Yeah, you shouldn't you got something that you're doing
[18173.06s -> 18192.88s]  Keep trying make sure you're having fun doing it. Is it safe point? All right now i'm gonna go bowling
[18203.08s -> 18205.32s]  The book is gonna make the combat unplayably hard
[18206.60s -> 18214.61s]  Watch out
[18214.61s -> 18216.21s]  Who is this guy?
[18216.21s -> 18220.44s]  I'll go back to brawler back to brawler
[18220.44s -> 18237.19s]  Stop hurting these guys. They attacked me
[18240.53s -> 18242.05s]  All right, let's go bowling
[18242.05s -> 18249.99s]  I'm into bowling
[18249.99s -> 18251.99s]  Use the book use the book
[18252.15s -> 18256.90s]  Okay
[18256.90s -> 18260.66s]  Hello, how can I help you? I'd like to challenge the staff
[18264.66s -> 18266.36s]  500 yen
[18266.36s -> 18282.61s]  How many would you like to play? Um free you challenge the staff you get a chicken
[18284.28s -> 18285.80s]  well, let me just
[18285.80s -> 18289.16s]  Figure out how to do it first
[18289.16s -> 18291.24s]  Okay, pull up the position and select ball
[18292.04s -> 18295.35s]  And then you can adjust the spin
[18295.35s -> 18297.62s]  And then just set power
[18297.62s -> 18302.50s]  Okay
[18302.50s -> 18312.44s]  All right 12 pounds adjust the power
[18313.16s -> 18317.32s]  Press left right before releasing the ball to adjust the spin
[18322.47s -> 18329.75s]  Um, yeah, but that was the computer doing that it wasn't me doing that
[18337.51s -> 18341.75s]  All right, let's go I want the 12 pound ball no, I want the 16 pound heavy tank
[18342.47s -> 18347.83s]  I'm gonna do the thing that I used to do when I went bowling and that's you get the huge wicked fucking heavy ball
[18348.79s -> 18352.55s]  And you just roll it really slowly diaper style down the middle of the lane
[18353.97s -> 18356.13s]  Well, I didn't I didn't get a chance to do that. Did I?
[18356.77s -> 18361.00s]  This is gonna be great
[18370.31s -> 18379.68s]  Diaper style is one diaper style is you go between your legs back and then forward
[18390.04s -> 18392.44s]  Too much spin too much too much too much too much too much too much
[18398.64s -> 18401.64s]  See this why I need to do it first before I challenge any staff member
[18402.36s -> 18404.85s]  You mean granny style it's diaper style
[18406.48s -> 18409.44s]  And you can do weirdo style, which is you go here
[18410.24s -> 18416.63s]  Or you go here you throw it diagonal and you try to get it to spin across the entire lane. We're gonna do it here
[18431.01s -> 18433.89s]  That's the best strategy I know what I call it weirdo style
[18442.24s -> 18444.96s]  It was a slight curve just a little not very much
[18446.32s -> 18451.04s]  All right, I got the hang of it
[18452.00s -> 18462.92s]  Let's do a eight pound
[18462.92s -> 18467.48s]  That's really slow. We need a very small spin here. It's gonna be very very slow
[18470.66s -> 18474.66s]  Almost get a striker. I'm gonna leave
[18475.75s -> 18477.27s]  um, okay
[18477.27s -> 18479.11s]  Well, how long you gonna stay here for?
[18479.11s -> 18487.68s]  No shit. Okay. Hold on. It's gonna take some spin
[18492.63s -> 18496.15s]  Twice way too much way too much way way way too much
[18501.01s -> 18503.01s]  Bowling till you get a perfect game
[18503.17s -> 18506.12s]  All right. Now let's challenge a staff member. I get it
[18510.31s -> 18512.31s]  Your bowling form is exquisite
[18512.95s -> 18516.95s]  You think so it really is the angle of your bottom when you release the ball is optimal
[18517.51s -> 18519.99s]  Would you learn how to do that?
[18519.99s -> 18521.99s]  No way, that's amazing
[18522.93s -> 18527.41s]  You know how to position your body with the best effect your form. It's really delightful. Ehehe
[18529.49s -> 18532.23s]  Oh, i'm sorry. It's just that I kind of have a bowling form fetish
[18537.96s -> 18541.32s]  All right, it just went up it went the game went up like two full letter grades
[18542.98s -> 18545.14s]  When I see someone with good form, I sort of forget myself
[18545.86s -> 18548.55s]  I see. I guess this job's perfect for you then
[18550.85s -> 18553.03s]  Yes, I think so, too
[18553.03s -> 18555.03s]  My name's emiri
[18555.11s -> 18555.91s]  What?
[18555.91s -> 18558.39s]  I hope to see you here more often. You have become a regular. Okay
[18560.93s -> 18562.93s]  Yeah, maybe I will it was nice to meet you
[18564.42s -> 18566.66s]  This could be the beginning of a friendship with emiri
[18567.46s -> 18569.94s]  Interacting with her will gradually fill the friendship gauge
[18570.58s -> 18575.78s]  You can check the status of this gauge at any time in the pause menu build your friendship with emiri and see what happens
[18576.34s -> 18579.41s]  Yep
[18579.41s -> 18584.13s]  Me and emir i'm gonna i'm i'm gonna go after me and emiri i'm gonna be like hey you want to go
[18584.53s -> 18587.96s]  Hey, you want to go bowling?
[18587.96s -> 18590.04s]  Mary, um, this is crazy. But uh
[18590.76s -> 18601.57s]  Do you ever want to go bowling sometime?
[18601.57s -> 18603.33s]  Would you like to play bowling?
[18603.33s -> 18605.73s]  Yes with pleasure. That'll be five hundred dollars
[18606.82s -> 18608.66s]  Oh, right, right, right, right
[18608.66s -> 18612.77s]  I'm gonna say that's not what I was looking for. Okay
[18614.40s -> 18623.11s]  Let's play
[18625.46s -> 18627.81s]  Here we go
[18627.81s -> 18629.81s]  Okay, what if I destroy her?
[18632.45s -> 18635.97s]  Where's my you know, where's my where's my 10 pound? There we go. Where's my 8 pound?
[18636.77s -> 18639.52s]  It's gonna be good. That's gonna be good
[18640.08s -> 18642.23s]  It's gonna be a strike
[18642.23s -> 18644.39s]  If it's not a strike add a million dollars to the debt
[18646.12s -> 18648.20s]  Oh my god, I get something for that. I have to
[18655.35s -> 18660.56s]  Oh shit tomato, what's up tomato raid? Let's go. What the hell is this strategy?
[18661.84s -> 18663.52s]  what
[18663.52s -> 18670.87s]  Not a bad strategy
[18671.27s -> 18673.83s]  Thanks tomato. Hope you had a good stream. Welcome everybody
[18674.47s -> 18677.99s]  You're playing um, why am I so why am I sitting?
[18678.71s -> 18681.01s]  Why am I watching her from that far away?
[18681.41s -> 18685.60s]  Aren't we together?
[18685.60s -> 18687.60s]  Why am I across the entire world?
[18688.08s -> 18692.88s]  You're not gonna pick it up. Oh my god, you left one pin
[18695.76s -> 18698.16s]  She sucks. How does it? No, she doesn't you got a nine
[18699.20s -> 18702.92s]  She's wearing heels
[18704.37s -> 18706.37s]  Oh fuck, okay, this is
[18710.26s -> 18713.25s]  Hmm
[18720.64s -> 18727.52s]  That wasn't funny this is gonna be good right here. I think we strike again
[18731.24s -> 18737.22s]  There it is. Oh, yeah, he picked it up. He's all right. He could he picked it up. He picked it up
[18746.42s -> 18749.30s]  I feel like the computer just guessed three or four times in a row
[18765.51s -> 18770.55s]  All right, so now i'm gonna i'm gonna do the comedy thing that happens in every movie by the way bowling has not appeared in a movie
[18770.55s -> 18772.55s]  in like 15 years
[18772.71s -> 18774.71s]  But every time it used to
[18774.79s -> 18776.15s]  um
[18776.15s -> 18782.28s]  Oh shit, i'm sorry. I mean nice almost good. Uh, nice try
[18783.16s -> 18784.20s]  um
[18784.20s -> 18787.08s]  Every like 90s movie that was a comedy they'd be a bowling segment
[18787.88s -> 18789.24s]  with
[18789.24s -> 18791.24s]  Like the person that was bowling would
[18791.40s -> 18797.64s]  Something would happen with their hand in the bowling ball and they would get stuck in there and then they would like fly down the entire bowling
[18797.96s -> 18799.48s]  uh lane
[18799.48s -> 18801.48s]  And hit the pins with their body and shit
[18802.12s -> 18805.56s]  How come they haven't made that joke in like 20 years?
[18806.28s -> 18814.18s]  Did that happen in too many movies and they were like, no, no, no, no more fly down the lane bowling joke
[18814.74s -> 18827.14s]  This is perfect. There it is
[18827.38s -> 18829.38s]  more more more more more
[18833.80s -> 18836.44s]  When was the last okay, I have homework for you guys
[18837.32s -> 18840.98s]  When you're laughing at me doing that, but you just got a gutter ball. Come on
[18841.88s -> 18847.72s]  Um, what was the last movie that had person flies down the lane holding the ball in their hand?
[18848.12s -> 18858.69s]  Uh, it happens in the avengers. No, it doesn't
[18863.59s -> 18865.59s]  It does not happen in the avengers
[18866.80s -> 18869.20s]  No, it does not it does not happen in the avengers
[18870.00s -> 18872.07s]  No, it doesn't
[18872.07s -> 18873.03s]  I

[18887.14s -> 18889.14s]  Okay avengers bowling scene
[18892.64s -> 18896.00s]  No, there is no bowling scene in the avengers. What are you talking about?

[18929.03s -> 18931.43s]  Yeah, the infinity gauntlet gets stuck in the bowling ball
[18932.55s -> 18934.72s]  I don't want to take it off though
[18934.72s -> 18937.99s]  I need to keep it on
[18946.56s -> 18952.61s]  Oh, how wary is it pretending? What do you what?
[18953.89s -> 18955.49s]  Let's not be playing
[18955.49s -> 18964.55s]  Look at that spin. No, no spin at all
[18965.84s -> 18967.92s]  She's pretending she wants she's trying to get me to win
[18970.66s -> 18972.82s]  I just want 56 to 22. I win
[18979.30s -> 18981.30s]  She's literally throwing
[18981.54s -> 18986.34s]  Well, do we get more friendship?
