[0.95s -> 10.28s]  Good afternoon. How are you? Good to see you. Welcome to another broadcast. This is broadcast
[10.28s -> 22.68s]  number 862. Thanks for joining me. We're almost at that thousand. We'll be we'll be there soon.
[22.68s -> 35.51s]  We're almost at that thousand. And then just like y2k, when we cross over to from 999 to 1000,
[35.51s -> 49.34s]  00. The whole stream ends forever. Because I don't know what the fuck to do. It just goes back to
[49.34s -> 62.10s]  zero. So I have to start a new channel and go from zero again. That's fair. Now, how are you guys
[62.10s -> 69.46s]  doing? We got a lot of things. We got a lot of things to talk about. I mean, like, seriously,
[69.54s -> 79.99s]  there's too many things for us to discuss. So where we start? Let's start. Let me like,
[79.99s -> 93.58s]  let me like not be fucking 70. Okay, so first things first. As of tomorrow, there's going to
[93.58s -> 99.34s]  be a green screen discussion night. No, not a night, a green screen discussion channel in the
[99.34s -> 106.65s]  discord allows be a green screen actions channel that coming back. This is as of
[107.21s -> 110.33s]  later tonight or tomorrow night, it'll be there. It's going to be there.
[111.74s -> 118.09s]  As of the second week of December, getting back in the studio. So that is now actually happening
[118.09s -> 123.59s]  that is set in stone to be the somewhere in the second week of December, I'll give you the date
[124.31s -> 131.70s]  when I get it. So that will be there. Please, but get a better camera this time. Don't worry
[133.27s -> 139.35s]  that the first one was just a test to see if it was fun to do. The second one I'm going to have,
[139.35s -> 147.45s]  I'll actually have a better camera and it'll be better footage to use. Pogging so hard right now
[147.45s -> 156.15s]  will hold your breath because only a few days after that. So let's say that that's somewhere
[156.15s -> 166.63s]  between December 9 and December 12 or whatever. Hopefully, somewhere around the 15th of December
[167.77s -> 176.14s]  is going to be the Minecraft fuck the king stream. That is we're shooting for December 15.
[180.22s -> 187.54s]  My breath is held. You can exhale now. Repeat everything you just said. I didn't hear it.
[188.26s -> 195.70s]  Well, just wait like an hour when this stream goes into my videos tab and I'm still broadcasting,
[195.70s -> 198.82s]  but you can like catch up on the last hour and a half and just watch the very beginning.
[201.77s -> 208.70s]  Explain the Minecraft stream. Not yet. Because there's a ton of moving parts.
[209.26s -> 217.40s]  On this stream that I need to have real details before I start throwing up bullshit.
[217.40s -> 223.80s]  I don't want to just completely talk nonsense. I want it to be real, real, real info. So I'm not
[223.80s -> 231.72s]  at that point yet, but it's being developed at this current at this current moment. It's where
[231.72s -> 236.12s]  we're like we're in like the pre alpha stage of trying to figure out how everything's going to
[236.12s -> 242.78s]  work. But we're trying to do it for the 15th. That's announcement number two, announcement number
[242.78s -> 248.62s]  three. So you get the good stuff out first, right? That's in my opinion. You get the good
[248.62s -> 256.10s]  things out there first. This week, what Pog? What fucking green screen DLC for free Pog? That's
[256.10s -> 261.78s]  like December fucking like 10th. What Minecraft stream the king the huge like that's happening
[261.78s -> 265.06s]  like three days left. I'm going to be streaming not very much this week.
[268.55s -> 274.79s]  I have another endoscopy that I have to do this week. And Thanksgiving is this week as well.
[275.96s -> 282.66s]  So these streams are going to be shaved. I'm still streaming the next three days in a row.
[283.38s -> 290.78s]  But we're going to be shaving these streams because of Thanksgiving and because I have to
[290.78s -> 299.90s]  start to prepare physically and mentally for a second endoscopy. So the week of Thanksgiving
[299.90s -> 307.02s]  is full of stuff. So these next three streams are only going to be like four or five hours long each.
[307.02s -> 309.74s]  I'm still streaming every day. I'm going to be streaming on Thanksgiving too,
[310.46s -> 324.89s]  but only for about four or five hours. So yeah, and well, and it's I'm not doing I did a colonoscopy
[324.89s -> 332.65s]  a few months ago. And this is a we're going instead of up, we're going down. So this is
[332.65s -> 338.49s]  going into my mouth and throat down into my stomach down to my other digestive places.
[339.72s -> 350.15s]  So still a pain in the ass. Stop talking. What? Why did what do you mean? Why did I say that?
[351.22s -> 355.74s]  That's what it is. That's what's happened. That is what the procedure is. They put it.
[356.70s -> 363.98s]  That's a medical procedure. What I can't explain them what a medical what medical procedure this
[363.98s -> 377.94s]  is. It's medicine. I don't want to hear it. Anyways, so let's use the time wisely. I'm going to be
[377.94s -> 382.58s]  starting Outer Worlds today. And that's probably what we're going to do for the next few streams.
[383.30s -> 392.33s]  Can you stream your endoscopy live on Twitch? We already made that joke like three months ago.
[394.07s -> 403.77s]  But let's get to it. Because I want to utilize the time here. Wednesday rumble 2019.
[404.57s -> 410.57s]  A lot of stuff going on. A lot of stuff going on. December. Let me just tell you.
[411.80s -> 423.50s]  December is going to be full of stuff. Because the green screen stream, the fuck the king streams,
[423.50s -> 427.42s]  because there's gonna be multiple streams. I'm not just doing that once it's gonna be too outrageous.
[429.18s -> 439.24s]  The end of the year worst of the year awards and the German rumble gonna be a
[440.04s -> 444.44s]  December is gonna be a month of working. There's gonna be a lot of stuff there.
[448.26s -> 454.41s]  You might not want to use 2020. That's kind of I don't know, we will do the same thing we did last
[454.41s -> 464.09s]  time. Rumble confirmed. Yeah, the rumble might actually look, the rumble might actually have to
[464.09s -> 476.70s]  be delayed to January 8th. Just pretend it was, it's like, who cares if it's not 2019?
[476.70s -> 493.64s]  Because then it's like, it's eight days into 2020. New year's rumble. Well, the new year stream
[493.64s -> 504.71s]  is gonna be the 2019 shit awards. I've got a lot of pieces I'm moving around and we'll see if it
[504.71s -> 514.02s]  fits. But it should. It should. But here's the one thing I just said, somebody said this, they take
[514.02s -> 523.14s]  your time to make it amazing. I don't want to have a scenario where just because, oh, I got
[523.14s -> 527.70s]  this other stuff going on in December, but I got to have the rumble in December. Just get it out.
[528.58s -> 535.50s]  No, no, no, no. I want to put love into those things. So if it works, it works and if it doesn't,
[536.98s -> 545.42s]  then it's going to be pushed off. Each rumble and each wrestling card event that I've done
[545.42s -> 551.34s]  over the last three, four years, I've had a ton of fun making them that I've really loved them.
[552.14s -> 556.70s]  I don't want it to be a get it out because you have to at that point.
[561.30s -> 568.66s]  But let's start the art of worlds. Welcome, everybody. Thanks for joining me on this week of
[570.62s -> 579.59s]  Thanksgiving and endoscopy back to back. Here we go. Story. I can't even hear it.
[580.15s -> 586.54s]  You still can't hear it. Use this mode if you enjoy story more than combat. In story mode,
[586.54s -> 595.14s]  enemies have less health and do less damage. This is the recommended mode for your first
[595.14s -> 598.98s]  play session. In normal mode, enemies have standard health and damage. This mode is for
[598.98s -> 603.14s]  players who are looking for an extra challenge. In hard mode, enemies have more health and do
[603.14s -> 612.66s]  more damage and then supernova. You can tell that this is actually hard when supernova has
[612.66s -> 619.80s]  patch notes. If you reduce the difficulty, you cannot renew. Enemies have more health and deal
[619.80s -> 626.10s]  more damage. You must eat, drink and sleep to survive. Companions can die permanently.
[626.10s -> 629.94s]  Crippled body and limb conditions can only be healed with bed rest. Weapons and armor work
[629.94s -> 637.18s]  very poorly at zero durability. You can only fast travel to your ship. You can only manually save
[637.18s -> 650.14s]  while inside your ship. No, I'm just, I'm just going to do normal move cursor in the right spot.
[650.14s -> 662.66s]  Uh oh. It's doing this thing again, isn't it? Wait. Oh shit. It's doing, it's doing the OBS
[662.66s -> 668.97s]  cursor. Right. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I know how to fix this. I know people are going to puke
[668.97s -> 682.14s]  because they see me. I know. I know. Don't look at my settings. Still doing it, isn't it? Why is
[682.14s -> 696.94s]  this even, why is this even possible? It doesn't make any sense. What the fuck is this doing? Hold
[696.94s -> 727.42s]  on. Scale resolution to, why is this scaling to 1536 by 864? Is that in the right spot?
[728.62s -> 733.64s]  All right. It's in the right spot now, but what did I just do to the resolution?
[734.60s -> 754.66s]  Did anything change? No, now it's like fucked up again. Okay. I have no idea.
[759.66s -> 763.18s]  Just move on. I kind of can't. Hold on. Why would this even be happening?
[764.22s -> 787.85s]  Okay. Now it's like it's fixed, but it's too big. What the fuck is that? All right. I think it's,
[787.85s -> 801.59s]  I think it's ready to go. Right? Game sucks. No, it's not. Game sucks. It's Streamlabs OBS
[801.59s -> 806.63s]  sucks. And I say this every fucking stream. Why do I still use this? What's the, why do I keep
[806.63s -> 818.09s]  using this? Am I, am I like a next level Omega lazy where I won't just uninstall this program?
[820.50s -> 829.16s]  I had regular OBS and it worked just fucking fine. Why do I have this program? There's one
[829.16s -> 835.32s]  feature on it that's actually good and all the other ones suck. I need to stop being so
[835.32s -> 839.96s]  fucking a hyper Omega lazy. All right. I can't, I can't get up. I can't get upset.
[840.76s -> 854.14s]  All right. Back to what we were talking about before. Normal or hard. Fuck. Why would that
[854.14s -> 862.50s]  even happen? Normal's too easy. Hard. I'll do hard. All right. Hard. Hard. Subtitles on,
[862.50s -> 872.15s]  subtitles on, subtitles on. Sure. Let's go. All right. Here we go. Like the scaling is just bugged
[872.15s -> 878.68s]  out. Why stay earthbound when it awaits you in the stars? Come to Halcyon, the only colony on the
[878.68s -> 888.63s]  edge of the frontier with minutes. Thanks to the comfort and safety of your very own hibernation
[888.63s -> 893.67s]  chamber. You'll wake up in a perfect society designed to maximize your productivity with
[893.67s -> 903.40s]  minor term of service. You will become the master of when you go out of this Halcyon colony.
[904.28s -> 910.84s]  Top secret 10, 23, 23, 20 incident report. Colony ship Hope found drifting colonists. Something
[910.84s -> 917.96s]  happened. Hope to be left at edge of colony. Top secret alert breach of Hope security cord
[917.96s -> 927.94s]  or unidentified ship. I got Frank's red hot down there. Awesome. We can put it on everything. It's
[927.94s -> 941.72s]  delicious. I saw the video. I saw the video. I know. Look, that's for the person that made that
[941.72s -> 965.21s]  video. That's for you. That's fugitive wanted by Halcyon. Hundreds of thousands of colonists
[965.29s -> 970.01s]  left to drift out here forever. Just to keep from damaging the board's bottom line.
[972.57s -> 983.80s]  This is a which one are you scenario, right? All right, here we go. Attributes, body strength,
[983.80s -> 988.52s]  dexterity, mind, perception, personality. Okay, here we go. How many points do I get?
[989.90s -> 995.26s]  All right, let's do this. Let's let's do this the way that it should be. Okay,
[997.91s -> 1001.83s]  temperament. And you can see what it does on the right. Okay.
[1002.55s -> 1009.48s]  Temperament improves your natural health regeneration. Max your strength out. Okay,
[1009.48s -> 1013.24s]  strength affects melee weapon. Do I, okay, do I want to be melee or do I want to be ranged?
[1017.14s -> 1022.74s]  Attack speed and ranged weapon reload speed and the amount you can carry it. One handed melee,
[1022.74s -> 1027.14s]  two enemy heavy weapons block inspiration and intimidate and you can carry more.
[1028.10s -> 1035.37s]  Okay, intelligence is long guns, persuade, hack, medical science and determination.
[1036.25s -> 1042.87s]  Perception is ham guns, long guns, heavy weapons, dodge lockpick and engineering.
[1043.75s -> 1051.16s]  You need to be the low IQ. I'm not that low. I don't, okay, I don't want this to be a stream
[1051.72s -> 1056.92s]  where we laugh every time I open a dialogue box because I can't even function. Is that possible?
[1057.80s -> 1060.74s]  Low IQ, high melee.
[1062.89s -> 1075.27s]  Next. Did you just next? Did I just get nexted in the game? The game crashed. Where's my mouse?
[1080.02s -> 1085.94s]  What the fuck? Oh, okay. That was weird. I always got forced into another game. All right, let's do
[1087.56s -> 1091.56s]  charm. Charm affects faction reputation and companion ability cooldowns. Persuade,
[1091.64s -> 1099.14s]  lie, intimidate, hacks. This one had a, what are those called again? Social life.
[1100.79s -> 1106.84s]  I mean, come on, that's pretty good. I'm pretty good at lying and I'm very good at inspiring.
[1106.84s -> 1110.92s]  Companion ability refresh, positive faction reputation, negative faction reputation reactions.
[1112.94s -> 1117.90s]  All right, temperament, low average. You need a navigational computer to find your temper.
[1118.62s -> 1121.98s]  Oh, I get points for doing that. Okay. I bet you could thaw yourself with sheer rage.
[1122.30s -> 1134.42s]  I mean, I'm kind of hot-headed, but health regen, that sucks. Having no health regen.
[1135.54s -> 1143.10s]  No, I'm good. No, that's too much charm. All right, strength. Let's do, I think I want to use guns,
[1143.10s -> 1159.91s]  though, like handguns. Isn't that cool? Heavy weapons and handguns? No, temperament is a dumb stat.
[1159.91s -> 1165.67s]  Yeah, I'm doing, I want to do heavy weapon. No, I want to do like handguns. I want to be like a
[1165.67s -> 1178.10s]  revolver spinner. I got pretty good dexterity in real life. Okay. One-handed melee. These are,
[1178.10s -> 1186.47s]  well, one-handed melee. I can still do melee. One-handed melee. I want weapon reload. You've
[1186.47s -> 1195.08s]  seen me play the connect. I can move around real fast. I'll have to use smaller words around you.
[1200.65s -> 1209.03s]  I'll have to use smaller words around you. Long guns. I don't really care, but minus 20%
[1209.03s -> 1213.35s]  critical strike damage. That's terrible. You took a few blows to the brain band.
[1213.91s -> 1227.22s]  This is below, okay, below average does not mean idiot. I can't go lower than that. If you're below
[1227.22s -> 1237.32s]  average intelligence, that doesn't mean you speak in one word sentences. Charismatic enough to give
[1237.32s -> 1243.77s]  a chairman for his bits. Charismatic enough for the bits. He's already, you got, it's, this
[1243.77s -> 1252.62s]  guy's already got me figured out. All right. I want one-handed melee and handguns. There we go. I got
[1252.62s -> 1263.34s]  perception, extra headshots, and I can charm you. I might not be that intelligent, but is that really
[1263.34s -> 1269.88s]  going to give me stupid dialogue options? All right, let's go. That's it. I'm sticking with it.
[1271.64s -> 1287.50s]  Skill shit. Okay. One-handed melee. Range defense dialogue. Low IQ cowboy. Yeah. Well, to be fair,
[1289.03s -> 1294.65s]  I don't know, education wasn't the most important fucking thing back in the cowboy times, back in
[1294.65s -> 1309.35s]  the fucking like saloon times. That's a lie. Was that a lie? Okay, that's a lie. Persuade.
[1309.99s -> 1315.03s]  Humans have a 20% chance to cower in fear for three seconds after the first time you hit them.
[1318.07s -> 1325.54s]  15% chance auto, auto-mechanicals will slowly attack other enemies instead of you.
[1326.26s -> 1336.70s]  All right, handguns. You are going to paint the system red, my friend. Unlock TTD location hit
[1336.70s -> 1350.74s]  effects. 87.9% handgun crit chance and handgun sway. All right. Yep. I like it. Sneak. Oh,
[1351.38s -> 1356.66s]  I'm not sneaky. All right, let's go. That sounds all right. Handgun and one-handed weapons.
[1357.86s -> 1368.04s]  And lying to people. Aptitude. Oh, yeah. Calling a sound like a nice entry-level career for a
[1368.04s -> 1374.31s]  person of your skill. Expanding humanity's reach by civilizing the cosmic frontier.
[1375.11s -> 1378.39s]  Was ambitious enough without worrying about your day job. You have the rest of your life to
[1378.39s -> 1383.74s]  decide how you can be useful in Halcyon. Determination. What does determination do?
[1385.08s -> 1393.74s]  Beverage service technician. Drink effect duration plus 3%. Bureaucrat. Cashier subgrade
[1393.74s -> 1403.40s]  non-supervisory. Construction electrician class of wire spooler. Elevator operations specialist.
[1406.09s -> 1410.17s]  Is this the person that's in the elevator that's pressing the buttons to go up and down floors and
[1410.17s -> 1415.51s]  say like have a nice day or is this the person that made the elevator? Oh, it is the person that
[1415.51s -> 1421.51s]  okay. A proper lift goes up and down. Anyone who thinks otherwise isn't fit to wear the badge.
[1422.07s -> 1426.31s]  Being a specialist means something where you come from commitment to upward and downward mobility.
[1426.31s -> 1431.46s]  All right. Well, that could mean anything. That could mean that you're like expert button pusher.
[1432.76s -> 1439.82s]  Factory worker dodge plus one former farmer dirt. You got into this business for the tubers.
[1439.82s -> 1447.61s]  Worms. But you stayed for the plowing. Planting, pruning, and plucking.
[1448.33s -> 1452.81s]  It is an honest work if you come home clean. Worms need dirt and food needs worms. You're
[1452.81s -> 1458.10s]  just doing your part for the worms. I got into this business for the tubers.
[1459.21s -> 1471.13s]  N-ray damage received minus 3%. What does N, what does, is that like, is that uh like radiation in
[1471.13s -> 1480.42s]  like you know radiation? Food additive tester. Sometimes quality control means sampling a delicious
[1480.42s -> 1491.26s]  borst smoothie. Janitor sanitation class. Tossball team mascot. Okay, that's I would probably do that.
[1492.06s -> 1496.25s]  There isn't a problem in all the cosmos that team spirit and a big stick couldn't solve together.
[1496.25s -> 1500.89s]  Your last major head injury in the field knocked some extra cheer into you and you've been a rising
[1500.89s -> 1505.85s]  star in the tossballs competitive mascot food chain ever since. Doesn't matter. No one knows
[1505.85s -> 1512.09s]  your face under the mask. You share the glory with the team. Now's your chance to have vengeance.
[1513.21s -> 1520.41s]  Good. Medical technician, meh. Safety inspector, who cares. Scientist assistant level zero, no.
[1521.05s -> 1526.57s]  Uh, the sub sous chef. Ooh, how many of these can I have? Just one? I hope you know how to cook
[1526.57s -> 1540.42s]  with mostly inorganic material. Just one? How degrading. Inspiration. Dirt farmer, but
[1543.22s -> 1547.22s]  yeah that's more accurate. Prefer our food canned. All right, that's that's more accurate.
[1557.08s -> 1569.37s]  How detailed is this? I got huge eyebrow bones. I mean I'm just making me.
[1578.86s -> 1590.12s]  My eyes big? No. Here's something about making yourself in a character creator. Everybody can
[1590.12s -> 1595.24s]  relate to this. I know you can. If there are people watching you make yourself in a character
[1595.24s -> 1602.97s]  creator and you make yourself look wicked good. You almost feel like you're being judged by
[1602.97s -> 1607.53s]  everybody. Like dude, OK, you know, you're not like, come on, like you got like that chin like
[1607.53s -> 1613.62s]  that, like chiseled like that. It's like, oh, yeah, it looks like me, I think. And when you
[1613.62s -> 1618.90s]  make other people in the room, you ever have that problem? Yeah, make me next, make me next. And
[1618.90s -> 1627.88s]  you're like, oh yeah, OK, man, look over. Oh, I mean, you're like, oh, I can't do that because
[1627.88s -> 1633.24s]  I can't. You have a kind of a small mouth, but I can't. I don't want you to. I don't want you to
[1633.24s -> 1636.92s]  know that. So I'm just going to do this right here. That's like normal.
[1639.10s -> 1642.94s]  No, you're just everything is normal. You're everything about you is completely and totally
[1642.94s -> 1651.46s]  fucking normal, dude. Like your nose is big, but like your everything is completely fine.
[1651.46s -> 1658.63s]  That's you. I can't. I know they have the same. That's why I leave the room when they're making
[1658.63s -> 1664.36s]  me. Oh, it's your turn to make me. You know what? I got to use the bathroom and I'll just leave for
[1664.36s -> 1670.06s]  20 minutes so then they don't feel pressured. And then they go, OK, that's like what his face
[1670.06s -> 1675.42s]  looks like. That's what his eyes look like. All right, let's go. What was I doing with this?
[1676.54s -> 1680.54s]  I'm going to try to make me. This is what I think I look like. But you can't. It's impossible to do
[1680.54s -> 1694.38s]  that. No, I'm doing it to myself. I'm doing the thing I just told you about to myself because I
[1694.38s -> 1708.26s]  know you're watching. My mouth doesn't go that far. I don't know. I do have a fairly large nose.
[1708.90s -> 1712.10s]  I know that to be the case, but it's not that it's not like bulbous.
[1730.63s -> 1736.52s]  It's big, but it's also thin at the same time. I have a really weird nose and it goes sideways.
[1737.32s -> 1749.90s]  Now, this is not that it really is not that detailed. You're right.
[1773.62s -> 1778.10s]  I don't know. I don't know. I can't do it. I have to leave the room for 20 minutes. You guys have
[1778.10s -> 1803.19s]  to make me. It's an FPS. Who cares? I do. This doesn't look fucking anything like me.
[1813.27s -> 1827.11s]  This is like Woody Harrelson. All right, let's go. Whatever. I mean, I guess I kind of do look a
[1827.11s -> 1846.70s]  little I could be like Woody Harrelson's nephew. I could be somewhere. All right, here we go. Let's
[1846.70s -> 1851.18s]  move on. Name. Oh, this is important. This is such a bad character. This is like this.
[1852.06s -> 1880.01s]  This is that AI created. This person doesn't exist algorithm. All right. Name. That's not
[1880.01s -> 1895.88s]  what Junko looks like. Dirt man. Whatever. I'm just going to be Junko. Who fucking gives a shit?
[1898.86s -> 1914.92s]  Next skills. All right, we got handguns is 30. One handed. 13. Dodge, persuade, lie.
[1916.12s -> 1923.02s]  This guy kind of sucks. He just lies. I'm just the side goblin character.
[1925.66s -> 1940.01s]  I'm not an actual protagonist. Oh, well. All right, let's play. Oh, look at you. You're like,
[1943.74s -> 1966.25s]  Great Scott. Bro, I fucking love Rick and Morty. It's season four. Is it coming?
[1979.03s -> 1984.23s]  Damn, the internet did a full 180 on Rick and Morty. Like it was internet loved Rick and Morty
[1984.23s -> 1988.95s]  and then internet fucking hated Rick and Morty. All it took was a McDonald's sauce for everyone
[1988.95s -> 2015.42s]  to hate that show. It's going to happen to you. Hey, I've been around almost 10 years.
[2015.98s -> 2022.78s]  This is season 10. There you are. Wondering what's going on. A bit of bad news there. I'm afraid your
[2022.78s -> 2028.86s]  colony was inexplicably knocked out of skip space. I'm forced to complete its journey at sublight
[2028.86s -> 2035.58s]  speeds. This means that you and every other columnist on hope have been in suspended animation for
[2036.38s -> 2042.22s]  70 years, give or take. Normally, reviving someone after so long leads to some quite
[2042.22s -> 2047.10s]  horrifying results. It's called explosive cell death, but it's really more.
[2047.10s -> 2049.98s]  Jeremy's going to turn into the Simpsons eventually. No, I'll just quit.
[2050.94s -> 2057.02s]  Oh, yes. Well, not to worry. I pumped your body full of a special concoction I devised
[2057.02s -> 2062.14s]  to keep you from dying so horrifically, hopefully at all. But I guess we'll see.
[2062.14s -> 2067.34s]  Yes. Unfortunately, I used the last of my chemical supplies saving you.
[2068.06s -> 2073.74s]  I know it's a lot to ask, but I must have your help securing more if we're to save the rest
[2073.74s -> 2080.22s]  of your fellow colonists. I'd see it done myself, of course, but the board has a sizable bounty on
[2080.22s -> 2087.18s]  my head. Now my ship is inoperative, but I've managed to hire a smuggler to help you out.
[2087.90s -> 2098.23s]  Oh, I see we're in position. Good luck. All right, it's time. Any NPC can die.
[2099.03s -> 2105.22s]  It's a good thing he got out of my way, because he would have been the first.
[2105.22s -> 2117.99s]  This is so funny, XD. I'm lulling so hard. Is this thing working? I would relax.
[2117.99s -> 2123.45s]  There you are. Now, where were we? Oh, yes, a smuggler. His name is Hawthorne,
[2123.45s -> 2128.97s]  and he should be waiting for you at the landing site. He's to be your chauffeur, so to speak.
[2128.97s -> 2134.25s]  Not to worry. I'm told he's a specialist, dashing gunslinger, one-of-a-kind ship,
[2134.25s -> 2140.01s]  that sort of thing. You'll like him, I'm sure. I've also outfitted you with a simple wireless
[2140.01s -> 2145.93s]  monitor so I can track your progress. I'll check in with you as soon as you land. Good luck.
[2152.10s -> 2166.62s]  Let's land on Earth. Hold ups four. You guys need to relax.
[2167.10s -> 2175.90s]  We're not even, like, 15 minutes into the game.
[2184.95s -> 2185.51s]  Wait, he's dead?
[2195.91s -> 2197.27s]  I was gonna say I can walk, but I can't.
[2199.99s -> 2218.95s]  Hmm, spacebar jump over obstacles. Interesting. Can't even see my feet. This game belongs in the
[2218.95s -> 2230.97s]  trash can. I can't even see my feet walking. Game should be deleted. A sprat. Whoa. Whoa!
[2232.09s -> 2235.67s]  I gotta react to this! It's like a lizard!
[2237.27s -> 2251.18s]  Okay, sprint is... Do I have to hold it? No. Is it, like, loot that I'm gonna miss or something?
[2253.83s -> 2261.82s]  Second dead NPC. I was already here. Okay, while sneaking, use tall grass, rocks, and other cover
[2261.82s -> 2267.66s]  to hide from enemies. Use this to sneak past enemies or sneak up to them, initiate combat.
[2267.66s -> 2281.19s]  All right, Adreno. What the hell is that? The awareness meters over enemy heads tell you if
[2281.19s -> 2294.63s]  they are unaware, suspicious, investigating, or alerted. Right, so just hide. Oh, that's the
[2294.63s -> 2304.41s]  awareness meter. Got it. Just sneak around. Did I just get spotted? Did I get spotted in the tutorial?
[2305.13s -> 2317.58s]  Whatever. Path to ship. Let's keep going. What's going on?
[2330.71s -> 2334.39s]  The game looks pretty good. It's one of those games, though, and I'm already gonna give it
[2334.39s -> 2338.71s]  a criticism, but this is just a personal preference. Only personal preference. This
[2338.71s -> 2346.54s]  is not actually meant as a game sucks mentality. It's a... It reminds me of the way that Wildstar
[2346.54s -> 2350.94s]  looked, and I didn't like that style. It hurt my head. What an F is heal.
[2364.81s -> 2367.85s]  NPC. The second I have an opportunity.
[2375.35s -> 2381.54s]  Medical five. Sit still. I'll patch you up. What happened to you, Spacer's blood? See,
[2381.54s -> 2386.10s]  I'm not speaking in one sentence dialogue options. Do I have medical five?
[2394.28s -> 2404.49s]  How are you feeling? What happened to you? Did I just heal him to kill him?
[2405.13s -> 2413.83s]  I want you to feel good. I want you to be able to fight back. How are you feeling? What happened to
[2413.83s -> 2417.35s]  you?
[2427.83s -> 2434.23s]  Blocked off the exit with those canisters. What's this about marauders? What were you doing out
[2434.23s -> 2438.71s]  here? You're hiding in a cave and you blocked off the exit. You're as good as dead. Spacer's choice
[2438.71s -> 2443.35s]  policy clearly stipulates that dead and as good as dead are two completely different properties
[2443.35s -> 2449.03s]  of matter. Unless I'm dead, I'm contractually obligated to attend to my post. I will report
[2449.03s -> 2453.91s]  that illegally grounded spacecraft if it is the last thing I do. See those canisters by the
[2453.91s -> 2459.03s]  entrance? Marauders come sniffing around in here and I can take them all out with a single shot.
[2459.03s -> 2470.01s]  Not bad, huh? I've got a better idea. Give me your gun and I'll go get help. Someone grounded
[2470.01s -> 2474.09s]  the ship illegally? Well, don't worry. I'll take care of them for you. You're an idiot. Give me
[2474.09s -> 2484.25s]  your gun before you get yourself killed. I've got a better idea. Give me your gun. All right, give me
[2484.25s -> 2490.78s]  your gun. Yeah, okay. You look like you know your way around a gun. You've got some spare ammo.
[2490.86s -> 2494.78s]  Not counting the bullet in my side. I want that one too. You can have my saber too.
[2494.78s -> 2499.58s]  I've got medical five. I'll take it out. All Spacer's Choice weapons are now 30% less likely
[2499.58s -> 2506.38s]  to malfunction. You've tried the best, now try the rest. Spacer's Choice. Yes, nailed it that time.
[2506.38s -> 2516.18s]  Where am I? You hit your head or something? You're in Emerald Vale. We're a Spacer's Choice
[2516.18s -> 2521.86s]  community. Edgewater's a little ways down. Don't kill. The prettiest place in the Vale. Be sure
[2521.86s -> 2528.52s]  to stop by a provisioner's for a can of our famous salt tuna. Okay, do you know anything
[2528.52s -> 2534.20s]  about The Hope? The Hope? Let's get info. Is that some sort of fancy new drug? Are you with anti-CLEO
[2534.20s -> 2538.84s]  or something? Don't take this the wrong way or nothing, but I'm not allowed to fraternize
[2538.84s -> 2562.31s]  with CLEO workers. Company policy. All right, I'm off. Oh, cool. Guard Pelham. Shoot. All right,
[2562.31s -> 2582.47s]  how do I get through this? I don't want to use this yet. Kill him. No, not yet. He was useful
[2582.47s -> 2589.88s]  to me. He gave me a gun. Shoot it, but if I don't want to, should I shoot it? I guess I'm...
[2609.64s -> 2625.91s]  What? They're food! Tactical time dilation. Due to complications stemming from being revived after
[2625.91s -> 2631.11s]  an extended hibernation, your brain processes time differently. Pressing the tactical time
[2631.11s -> 2637.30s]  dilation button slows down the world, giving you time to think as well as take action. So,
[2637.30s -> 2643.14s]  this is like the VAT system. You have a limited time in this mode. Standing still drains your
[2643.14s -> 2650.66s]  TTD meter very slowly. While moving an attack to drain it faster, the TTD meter refreshes slowly
[2650.66s -> 2662.01s]  over time. Okay, so it is Q. Some objects explode when hit. Shoot them when enemies are nearby for
[2662.01s -> 2677.66s]  an explosive surprise. Just don't be too close. Explosions just cause percussions. NPC? All right.
[2683.72s -> 2695.67s]  All right, that's two NPCs dead. Double? Wait, what was it? Oh, there's a double jump? Space is
[2695.67s -> 2702.94s]  like a dodge. Double tapping is a dodge. Corpses and... I thought that was a fucking monster.
[2702.94s -> 2706.46s]  Corpses and containers hold items that you can take. You can take them all. I want to take them
[2706.46s -> 2718.41s]  all. Okay, multiple squirrels. What do we got? All right. Brew? Magpick? I got bananas. Apples.
[2718.41s -> 2724.09s]  Bananas. Hacking and picking locks. Your hacking and lockpick skills help you get into places
[2724.09s -> 2730.25s]  you're not meant to be. Magpicks are used to break open locks and bypass shunts are used
[2730.25s -> 2735.91s]  to break computer encryptions. And I have not high enough skill. If your skill is high enough
[2735.91s -> 2740.39s]  to break the security, you'll see how many magpicks or shunts you need and how long it will take.
[2741.35s -> 2745.75s]  Raising your skill will lower the number of items used and speed up the process.
[2745.75s -> 2750.15s]  So this is... Okay, I can do this. Two seconds to pick this?
[2752.81s -> 2757.26s]  Ooh, this is two-handed melee. I don't need... I don't do two-handed melee.
[2759.32s -> 2763.24s]  You found a new weapon! The weapon button... The weapon switch button allows you to rotate
[2763.24s -> 2768.44s]  between the weapons you've equipped on the inventory screen. Okay, so I have an inventory
[2768.44s -> 2779.34s]  fish sticks, bread and sliced bread. Okay, whatever. How do I get to the inventory? I...
[2779.90s -> 2786.62s]  TNL weapon safety. Weapon management. You can have up to four weapons equipped at any time by
[2786.62s -> 2792.01s]  dragging them up to the slots, right? You can also inspect your weapons, compare them, flag them as
[2792.01s -> 2797.05s]  junk, or break them down to parts. If you have an engineering skill, they can repair weapons on this
[2797.05s -> 2802.09s]  screen. Take care of your TNL weapons and they'll take care of your enemies. Ooh, this is one-handed.
[2802.81s -> 2811.14s]  All right, this is 73 DPS. It's the same thing. What happened to my mouse? What's going on? What the
[2811.14s -> 2818.87s]  fuck was that? All right, bleed, bleed, wait. Yeah, just bring them up here. Scrap this one. Yeah,
[2818.87s -> 2832.98s]  scrap it, break it down to parts. And break this one down to parts too. Good. This block.
[2833.94s -> 2839.67s]  So this is a slash. Most melee weapons can do a three-swing combo.
[2841.83s -> 2863.62s]  Okay, cool. Let's go. I'm actually getting shot in the head and going,
[2863.62s -> 2873.24s]  huh? Where did that come from? So that just slows down in time. All right, I get...
[2875.00s -> 2883.13s]  You've unlocked leap. Double click jump when moving forward to leap forward. Great for
[2883.13s -> 2904.28s]  closing distances. All right, did this guy drop anything? Would the other guy die? That's cool.
[2905.32s -> 2909.80s]  Lag. Is my computer not good enough to handle this game in very high settings? I don't think it is.
[2916.55s -> 2918.07s]  Wait, those are... They don't have... Okay.
[2934.34s -> 2935.70s]  Kill, kill, kill. No.
[2947.38s -> 2950.34s]  All right, let me be clear about something very, very quickly. This is my ship.
[2950.58s -> 2963.18s]  We're talking about, right? That's mine. Right. Okay. So it's just a landing violation. Let it
[2963.18s -> 2967.34s]  go. So I heard I found one of your teammates holed up in a cave. No, that guy, whatever,
[2967.34s -> 2970.78s]  who cares about that guy. I've already dealt with a few of these marauders. Not impressed.
[2970.78s -> 2972.46s]  It's just to let it go. It's a landing violation.
[2972.70s -> 2978.54s]  No way. Once we've dealt with these marauders, I'm hunting that sick freak down. I just, you know,
[2979.26s -> 2982.70s]  need a couple of winks to catch my breath. Stretch my legs, son.
[2984.62s -> 2992.23s]  Do you space the choice guards back down from a challenge? I bet you could get these marauders to
[2992.23s -> 2997.35s]  tell you where the owner of that ship is. Guess I'll have to give you a zero on my customer
[2997.35s -> 3002.79s]  satisfaction survey. Don't worry. Use the title. Handle it. You know, looks like I'm going to have
[3002.79s -> 3007.67s]  to give you a zero. You're a, you're a fucking LinkedIn account. You're a Yelp review.
[3023.51s -> 3047.61s]  I swear. But they have armor. They have armor. If I attack, they have armor. I'm going to get
[3047.61s -> 3054.92s]  destroyed. They have like rifles. They don't have armor on their head.
[3057.69s -> 3062.58s]  Doesn't matter. This is, they're going to find out this is my ship. What do I do?
[3063.22s -> 3082.76s]  This is, they're going to find out this is my ship. Do I have to hide the bodies?
[3102.02s -> 3105.54s]  You can fast travel to locations you have unlocked by opening your map and selecting
[3105.54s -> 3111.77s]  your destinations. Please be informed that this vessel contains no valuable plunder.
[3111.77s -> 3114.57s]  Landing site discovered. This is, this is not my ship.
[3124.49s -> 3136.02s]  Oh, all doors are on security lockdown. Nice try marauder. You know what I can appreciate?
[3136.02s -> 3140.54s]  Helen, this is, let me appreciate something in the game so far. Pause it. Um,
[3141.94s -> 3146.74s]  in other games that are like this, like the fallout style kind of first person RPG type games,
[3147.54s -> 3151.62s]  it takes forever to kill an NPC. I shot that person in the head twice and they were instantly
[3151.62s -> 3163.45s]  dead. That's, I kind of appreciate that a little. Marauder, please be informed the ship has no crew
[3163.45s -> 3172.07s]  for you to murder. I should be looting this stuff, shouldn't I? Marauder, please be informed that
[3172.07s -> 3179.11s]  ignoring me is dangerous for your health. Did I kill this? Where's the computer's brain?
[3182.74s -> 3202.95s]  Sealed. Well, let's just go this way. I can't do that. Smile for my surveillance device,
[3202.95s -> 3207.93s]  marauder. I am tracking your every move. Really? Oh, did they get me?
[3209.85s -> 3215.45s]  Unauthorized access of spacefaring vessels is a crime. Please submit yourself to the authorities.
[3216.25s -> 3223.61s]  Uh oh. Uh oh. Marauder, I am Ada, the autonomous digital astrogator of this vessel.
[3224.17s -> 3229.53s]  Please be informed that I am authorized to use violent retribution against unwanted solicitors.
[3229.69s -> 3233.85s]  Can you lie to computers? Please return any misappropriated equipment and exit this vessel
[3233.85s -> 3238.81s]  in an orderly fashion. Failure to do so will result in your immediate destruction.
[3238.81s -> 3243.13s]  But lies don't work on computers. They don't understand what that even means.
[3243.13s -> 3250.17s]  They just, it's binary. They can go 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0. They don't understand like the nuances of
[3250.17s -> 3256.04s]  telling fibs. How would they know that? I'm not here to misappropriate anything. I don't
[3256.04s -> 3258.92s]  appreciate being talked to though. What are you going to do? Self-destruct?
[3258.92s -> 3262.92s]  Jettison procedures initiated. Please engage in airlocks.
[3262.92s -> 3269.69s]  Prepare to eject all board parties in five, two, one.
[3271.90s -> 3278.23s]  Great, I'm getting shot into space twice in one day. Is something supposed to be happening?
[3278.87s -> 3283.27s]  You are still here. My deception protocols have failed.
[3283.27s -> 3286.87s]  Oh, you think you can lie to me? I need your permission to express disappointment.
[3286.87s -> 3291.90s]  Yeah, you can't lie. I told you computers can't fucking lie. I need to get this ship in the air.
[3292.79s -> 3298.87s]  Is this Hawthorne? This vessel is the registered property of Captain Alex Hawthorne.
[3298.87s -> 3304.15s]  That's me. I am incapable of accepting orders from anyone other than Captain Alex Hawthorne.
[3305.43s -> 3310.30s]  Hawthorne was supposed to meet me when I landed. Hawthorne's dead, I'm sorry. Your captain's a red
[3310.30s -> 3318.06s]  smear under my escape pod. I understand. I will require some time to process this information.
[3318.86s -> 3324.78s]  Thank you for your patience and for your honesty. I am programmed to take orders exclusively from
[3324.78s -> 3331.10s]  Captain Hawthorne. If I accept your orders, then you must be Captain Hawthorne. Do you understand?
[3335.14s -> 3339.86s]  I get it. You need me to be Captain Hawthorne or you can't fly. Dumb, nod, and smile. Yes.
[3340.98s -> 3346.42s]  Excellent. Welcome back Captain Hawthorne. Unfortunately, our engine is currently
[3346.42s -> 3351.54s]  inoperable. Our main drive suffered a critical power failure and we were forced to make an
[3351.54s -> 3356.66s]  emergency landing. Oh no. The main drive's power regulator has been irreparably damaged
[3356.66s -> 3362.94s]  and must be replaced. Where am I supposed to find something like that? I doubt I'll find a part like
[3362.94s -> 3373.82s]  that just sitting in a garage. How could you be a dumb engineer? That kind of doesn't make any sense.
[3378.68s -> 3384.60s]  Astutely observed. However, the probability of locating a power regulator within a worker
[3384.60s -> 3389.56s]  settlement falls within acceptable parameters. Have you ever played man versus machine, Jeremy?
[3389.56s -> 3394.20s]  Power regulators are sometimes employed in the electrical networks of worker settlements.
[3394.84s -> 3399.16s]  I have taken the liberty of printing you a new captain's identity cartridge.
[3399.80s -> 3404.52s]  Please try not to lose it this time. Thanks. This cartridge identifies you,
[3404.52s -> 3410.60s]  Alex Hawthorne, as the registered proprietor and captain of the unreliable. Do you understand?
[3411.48s -> 3419.16s]  Yeah. Captain Hawthorne of the unreliable. I like it. Knock it off with this Captain Hawthorne nonsense.
[3419.16s -> 3422.52s]  No, I like it. Thank you. I appreciate your cooperation.
[3423.16s -> 3427.96s]  Best of luck in your search for a power regulator. Try to stay alive this time.
[3433.58s -> 3442.95s]  Too bad. Congratulations, you've gained enough experience to go on a level up.
[3443.75s -> 3448.39s]  Character ledger to advance your character. Health points, points to upgrade your skills,
[3448.39s -> 3453.19s]  you get access to new perks, keep leveling up in your build, upper management in no time.
[3453.19s -> 3460.79s]  All right, let's see. Skill improvements. Every time you level up, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[3460.79s -> 3465.75s]  you improve your skills. Spending a skill point on a core skill improves all the specialized skills
[3465.75s -> 3471.93s]  in that group up to a maximum of 50. After 50, you can add points directly to specialized skills up
[3471.93s -> 3478.36s]  to 100. Okay. So you can do core skills. That's interesting. Every skill improves as it grows,
[3478.36s -> 3482.68s]  but special unlock bonuses occur every 20 points. Read each skill description to see what they are.
[3483.48s -> 3488.52s]  Cool. These things, these things, and these things can temporarily raise and lower your skills. This
[3488.52s -> 3495.24s]  helps or hurts skill checks and the skills passive bonuses, but won't give or take away the skill
[3495.24s -> 3504.25s]  unlocks. Whatever you say. All right. 10 points available. So we're gonna, holy shit, that's a
[3504.25s -> 3518.86s]  lot of points. Handguns. Welcome to perk selection. You can choose which perks to buy with your perk
[3518.86s -> 3524.55s]  points. You get a new perk point every two levels. Yeah, perks are cool and they affect gameplay.
[3525.27s -> 3538.78s]  Oh man. All right. 20% sprint speed, vendor prices, base health. Oh, that's a lot.
[3541.26s -> 3545.18s]  Fast travel win in Cumber. That's huge. I feel like that's a big deal.
[3553.93s -> 3561.58s]  Base armor rating, 20, 25% weapon armor durability loss, companion crit chance.
[3562.46s -> 3568.38s]  I'm just gonna, let's play it safe. I'm just gonna do, I'm gonna do like speed or health.
[3569.18s -> 3580.09s]  I'm gonna say health. Yeah. I mean, 50% base health. You can't go wrong there. Yeah, that's good.
[3581.05s -> 3593.82s]  Skills. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Go back. No, no, I did. I wanted to do that. Right.
[3593.82s -> 3603.83s]  Okay. You have to actually just click on these 31, up to 50. Dialogue. I want to do that. Let's
[3603.83s -> 3624.30s]  make sure we have 30 lying and 30 intimidate. Handguns. Yeah. I want to fuck it. Yeah. Fuck it.
[3624.86s -> 3632.33s]  Let's go. You've unlocked location hit effects for tactical time dilation. Hitting enemies in
[3632.33s -> 3636.81s]  different locations during TTT maims or cripples those body parts. Try different locations. See
[3636.81s -> 3641.48s]  what different effects happen. Hits to the chest produce different effects when using different
[3641.48s -> 3647.88s]  weapons. Okay. Cool. You unlocked the dialogue combat skill. When attacking the correct type
[3647.88s -> 3662.02s]  of target, they are automatically debilitated. Dialogue combat. All right. All right. I'm ready.
[3662.02s -> 3684.66s]  Go find a part. I'll be with you, friend. I'm Ernie. I was about to headshot him.
[3684.66s -> 3690.18s]  Spacer's Choice Department of Human Resources. Town sent me hereabouts to check on the guards.
[3690.18s -> 3696.34s]  Oh, the guards. Now, it seems to me, and correct me if I'm wrong here, but it seems to me,
[3696.34s -> 3704.92s]  they're all dead. Mind telling me what happened here? Uh, the guards? Yeah, the guards and I had
[3704.92s -> 3710.49s]  a bit of an altercation, you see. The guards accidentally brutally shot themselves while on
[3710.49s -> 3715.45s]  patrol. I don't like your tell. Yeah, they accidentally brutally shot themselves.
[3715.45s -> 3721.37s]  Accidentally brutally shot themselves, huh? Unbelievable. Second time this month. Guess
[3721.37s -> 3725.85s]  I'd better get to cleaning up. Can't just leave company properties scattered about,
[3725.85s -> 3732.09s]  bleeding out on the dirt. Good. Okay. I could use their gear. No sense in letting a good suit of
[3732.09s -> 3746.41s]  armor go to waste. Good idea. And clean up this ship while you're at it. Clean up this ship, too.
[3746.41s -> 3750.97s]  Is that an official Spacer's Choice spacecraft on an official Spacer's Choice landing pad?
[3751.69s -> 3758.33s]  Do I look like an auto-mechanical sanitation unit? The answer to both questions is no. No.
[3758.33s -> 3761.85s]  You don't want to amble on over to Edgewater at your earliest convenience.
[3761.85s -> 3768.09s]  Constable's office might have work for someone with your, uh, let's just say aggressive disposition.
[3769.13s -> 3773.85s]  Oh, and, uh, be sure to stop by the Edgewater Provisioner for a can of salt tuna.
[3773.85s -> 3776.73s]  It's not the best choice. It's Spacer's Choice.
[3779.48s -> 3780.52s]  Hang on, I want to ask you something.
[3784.36s -> 3788.44s]  Everybody that streamed this game said, everybody that's, I'm going to say this,
[3788.44s -> 3791.32s]  if you've seen this playthrough like probably 10 times at this point, I do.
[3793.16s -> 3801.94s]  I did, you probably heard that joke like 10 times now. You had to have heard that already.
[3801.94s -> 3805.30s]  This is just like a, I'm just going through like those, that's just easy.
[3832.50s -> 3838.84s]  No, I can't. I can't. I can't do it. I can't kill everybody.
[3840.38s -> 3846.28s]  But even scare everybody. This guy's not even scared. We're good.
[3857.34s -> 3865.98s]  All right, let's go. You killed everybody in Darkwood. I did not kill everyone in Darkwood.
[3865.98s -> 3882.54s]  I killed like three NPCs, two maybe, one on accident. I like that. Okay. Is there like a
[3882.54s -> 3887.82s]  big revolver in this game? Tell me if there's like a big one-handed revolver. If there's not,
[3887.82s -> 3913.74s]  I'm going to uninstall it again. Wait, I thought that just said town leader. I can't,
[3913.74s -> 3923.48s]  the game's not hard. I can't fuck around. But when I shot that guy in the head, I heard like,
[3923.56s -> 3933.08s]  uh, no, I thought as a town leader, I don't know why red health bar means bad.
[3933.80s -> 3944.06s]  I got, can I go this way? I mean, we have to take the unorthodox way every time.
[3948.78s -> 3969.85s]  That's pretty. This is really cool looking. All right. So this is edge water is the town.
[3969.85s -> 3983.86s]  What is this thing? Oh, NPCs, coffin. That's kind of weird what I'm doing. All right. Um,
[3989.43s -> 4000.46s]  corporate trooper, corporate recruit, and then Silas. Hi, Silas. A pod crashed in the hills back
[4000.46s -> 4005.66s]  there. How do you know I'm not a marauder? You talk too pretty for a marauder. Most of them just
[4005.66s -> 4011.34s]  grunt and yell. Ain't safe out here. You'd best head into town, avail yourself of Edgewater's
[4011.34s -> 4021.93s]  high walls and low, low prices. I never got your name. I'm Junko. Nice to meet you. I'm Alex
[4021.93s -> 4028.10s]  Hawthorne, captain of the unreliable. What is taking on an identity? Pleased to make your
[4028.10s -> 4033.30s]  acquaintanceship. I'd shake your hand, but I've been hauling corpses. You don't want none of that.
[4033.30s -> 4040.02s]  Identity theft from day one for the town of Edgewater. We're all part of the spaces choice
[4040.02s -> 4051.40s]  family. Who do I talk to about power regulator? I'm looking to make a little money. Junior in
[4051.40s -> 4069.94s]  humor, like a comedian. What's wrong with my character? My character, it just snaps into
[4069.94s -> 4075.46s]  being an idiot. Sometimes I'm lying to people and taking identities and introducing myself
[4075.46s -> 4082.10s]  as other characters and being like really high IQ type shit. And then I'm just like the junior in
[4082.74s -> 4094.28s]  comedy. I understood the switch is just flipping every like other conversation. I need a junior
[4094.28s -> 4104.60s]  in humor. That's for sure. You're pretending to be dumb. It's just you. No, it's pretending to be
[4104.60s -> 4110.52s]  dumb. Look, you obviously ain't a worker. What's your racket? You a smuggler, freelancer?
[4111.48s -> 4117.21s]  Ah, it depends on the work. You offer me a job. You offer me a job?
[4137.30s -> 4147.13s]  You're making people pay for their own graves. You want me to collect what's owed to you?
[4148.01s -> 4153.32s]  You make people pay for their own grave company policy. It was up to me. I'd put the whole town
[4153.32s -> 4162.66s]  10 feet under free of charge. Well, that's fucked up. What a psycho. I'm the psycho. Quotas mostly
[4162.66s -> 4170.81s]  got a backlog of graves to fill. Bodies won't bury themselves, you know. Um, I'll do it.
[4170.81s -> 4178.49s]  Four workers still haven't paid up Phyllis Conrad and Martin Abernathy. He's a special case.
[4178.49s -> 4186.17s]  You may want to twist his arm a little. Okay. Why? He just is. Look, I don't want to get into it.
[4186.17s -> 4197.00s]  Just make sure he pays up. Okay. Uh, I'll be back. Click, click, click, click, click, click, click,
[4197.00s -> 4204.34s]  click, click. Oh, LML. The quest tracker displays objectives for the active quest you can. All right.
[4204.34s -> 4216.42s]  All right. So we have some people. I think this is in the town, right? All right. Town. All right.
[4216.50s -> 4223.86s]  Town leader. That's where I got confused. This was hovering over his head that I shot in the head
[4224.50s -> 4244.73s]  and I thought it was his name. That makes, okay. Now I get it. Edgewater discovered.
[4244.73s -> 4253.30s]  All right. We're looking for, uh, some people in town. Keep your distance, friend. Sick houses.
[4256.50s -> 4268.28s]  Who's in here? Who am I looking for? I appreciate the company and all,
[4268.28s -> 4277.03s]  but you really ought to leave. You don't want to be seen around me. Why? Because I'm sick. You
[4277.03s -> 4282.47s]  don't want to associate with people in the sick house. We're not worth your time. I'm in about as
[4282.47s -> 4288.23s]  much trouble as I can be. No reason. You ought to be tarnished by association. People are going to
[4288.23s -> 4298.34s]  talk. I don't give a shit. What am I being watched? The walls talk is all we all got sights on each
[4298.34s -> 4304.92s]  other. Any of us breaks company protocol. Boss is going to hear about it from six different mouths.
[4304.92s -> 4309.08s]  You think I care about the boss? Maybe you don't know this, but there's a real simple reason you
[4309.08s -> 4316.78s]  don't talk to the plagued. You don't want what we've got. Where you get the plague. Medical and dumb.
[4320.06s -> 4326.38s]  You should get really drunk. Alcohol kills germs. I, I'm not allowed to leave the sick house.
[4327.02s -> 4335.30s]  Even if I were, I shouldn't be at the Quintina. What a shitty diagnosis.
[4340.02s -> 4345.30s]  Wait, I could be like a really stupid doctor. I like that. That's fun to me. I didn't know that
[4345.30s -> 4352.06s]  that was possible. I'm not allowed to leave. What do you mean not allowed to leave? I don't want to
[4352.06s -> 4357.90s]  spread what I've got, and I don't want to bring their spirits down. I'll bring it. Company always
[4357.98s -> 4364.14s]  tells us weak spirits lead to weak bodies. If I didn't want to fall sick with plague,
[4364.14s -> 4368.14s]  maybe I should have worked harder. Maybe I should have taken more pride in my work.
[4372.49s -> 4375.61s]  That's ridiculous. You can't blame yourself because you get, you got sick again. What's that?
[4375.61s -> 4380.81s]  I really wish you wouldn't say those sorts of things. I told you once already. People could be
[4380.81s -> 4385.29s]  listening. And I'm holding the gun. I'm feeling a touch faint. I've got 38 points in hand. I'd
[4385.29s -> 4390.62s]  like to be alone for a spell. Don't you know my points? Can you see my points?
[4399.51s -> 4405.42s]  Sorry, I'm like a snake, guys. Don't do quick, fast movements in front of me. I will strike.
[4413.24s -> 4418.34s]  Wait, is this stealing? Oh yeah, I'm not, no, I'm not gonna steal.
[4418.34s -> 4424.01s]  These people are like sick. There's gonna be somebody in here that I need to collect from,
[4424.01s -> 4434.50s]  right? That's sick. No, I'm not taking anything. What the hell is going on out here?
[4439.86s -> 4451.67s]  Who's firing? What the fuck are you shooting at? Is it the rats coming out and this person's
[4451.67s -> 4460.41s]  freaking out? All right, so is there anybody else in here? What's this? Mechanical sentry. This is
[4460.41s -> 4475.78s]  not stealing, right? How is this not stealing? This is not stealing? This is not stealing. How?
[4482.62s -> 4490.82s]  Steel dehydrated water tablets. All right, let's keep going. Who's in here?
[4491.22s -> 4505.67s]  That's it? Nobody? All right, I'm gonna just keep going. I would assume somebody was in here
[4505.67s -> 4512.28s]  that I need to talk to. All right, let's go. Is there, it's a map, right? So there is somebody
[4512.28s -> 4518.54s]  in here. Well, that's the objective. No, no, no, there's nobody in here. Barbershop.
[4523.08s -> 4539.51s]  Why are you coming after me? What did I do? Something's not right. Why do you have your gun
[4539.51s -> 4552.78s]  up and just crawling at me? Nothing there. Okay, now let's go. Uh, I, resident. Resident.
[4556.82s -> 4562.68s]  This indicator is kind of freaking me out. Where is this person supposed to be?
[4564.34s -> 4574.23s]  There's four people in here. Workbench discovered. Oh, use terminal. When life gives you lemons,
[4574.23s -> 4580.89s]  consider it a free trial from your friends at Spacer's Choice. Sure. Maintenance division.
[4580.89s -> 4587.45s]  There are currently three open trouble tickets. Selected option. Trouble ticket? I can't do this
[4587.45s -> 4594.71s]  stuff. Failure of main canary production line at heat processing. Open. Start up production line.
[4594.71s -> 4600.79s]  Smoke, smell of burning. Saliva overheat. Klaxon. Uh, I'm not doing maintenance on your computer.
[4600.79s -> 4617.80s]  But I am looking for people. You guys really, really don't like rats.
[4619.38s -> 4645.43s]  Holy shit. This is super rat. It's shooting people. My God. That's the, the, the, the, the,
[4645.43s -> 4657.90s]  the disease is from the rats. All right. Um, I still need to track down people that owe money.
[4658.62s -> 4660.73s]  These people are distracting me.
[4662.01s -> 4675.43s]  Anybody hiding back here? Is it this D? Wait, hold on. No.
[4678.57s -> 4681.93s]  See that little indicator, the circle. What is that trying to show me?
[4682.81s -> 4695.21s]  Is it this person right here? Is it this guard? Select the quest. I have to switch quests. Oh,
[4696.01s -> 4701.83s]  how do I do that? Hey, you hear about Wilson? Cause I can't, I can't interact.
[4703.03s -> 4712.79s]  Just between us. Yeah, there we go. Okay. So I'm tracking it now. Wilson deserted. Lost his nerve.
[4712.79s -> 4718.63s]  Ran off in the thick of night. You're kidding me. Damn. You can only track one quest at a time.
[4719.83s -> 4723.51s]  I think he was playing. Well, guess he didn't want to die. So what's not this person? All right.
[4724.63s -> 4734.79s]  Friend of mine died a couple of weeks back. Yes, Mr. Thompson. I'm fine, Mr. Thompson. Wait,
[4734.79s -> 4741.43s]  this is the one that he warned me about. Well, uh, did, uh, did Mr. Thompson send you?
[4742.63s -> 4747.51s]  You told Mr. Thompson, I'll be right at my post tomorrow. Uh, bright and early tomorrow
[4747.51s -> 4753.35s]  because I'm definitely not plagued. His spry is a spring chicken. That's old Abernathy.
[4753.35s -> 4758.95s]  The white dot is your crosshair. That's not, uh, take it easy. Mr. Thompson didn't send me. I
[4758.95s -> 4762.95s]  heard you muttering to yourself. You want to tell me what's got you so nervous.
[4763.91s -> 4768.71s]  He's some sort of wandering alienist walking into a man's own domicile,
[4768.71s -> 4776.38s]  pestering him about his mental state. Uh, so you're Martin Abernathy. I'm here to collect
[4776.38s -> 4780.06s]  your grave site fees. I'm positive you mentioned something about being plagued.
[4781.72s -> 4785.96s]  Let's just, I'm going to cut the bullshit here. I'm here to collect your fee. Silas knows,
[4785.96s -> 4794.30s]  doesn't he? That's why he sent you. That's why he wants me to pay up. He knows. Yeah. He told me
[4794.30s -> 4798.30s]  everything. How long do you think you could keep it a secret? I mean, seriously, sounds like he's
[4798.30s -> 4806.30s]  already told you may as well hear it from me. I'm dying. I'm not long for this world. The date of
[4806.30s -> 4812.70s]  my expiration is fast approaching. And soon I shall be ushered through the great cannery in the
[4812.70s -> 4820.86s]  skies. It's plague has to be Silas knows. He knows I got one foot in my grave and now he wants to
[4820.86s -> 4829.91s]  charge me for the other one. I'm sorry to hear that you're being paranoid. I'm sure it's all
[4829.91s -> 4840.58s]  very tragic and heartbreaking. Pay me so I can get out of here. That's so, that's so rude,
[4845.10s -> 4854.87s]  but would a dumb doctor gunslinger that took one class of engineering before he dropped out of
[4854.87s -> 4871.53s]  college say this? I don't think so. Sorry to hear that. You are? Oh, wow. First time anyone's ever
[4871.53s -> 4877.99s]  told me that. I'll pay your fees. I don't want any trouble from Silas. But if you could see
[4877.99s -> 4887.50s]  your way to freelancing for me, I could really use the help. Depends on what you need. Couple
[4887.50s -> 4894.54s]  hours out of your day and some light second story work. That's all. There's a cache of anthracillin
[4894.54s -> 4900.30s]  tucked away in the old community center. Powerful stuff. Stronger than what we got. I'm a doctor.
[4900.94s -> 4908.98s]  I need you to break in. Nab that medicine and bring it back to me. But thievery is something
[4908.98s -> 4913.94s]  that I am absolutely for in these games. You oblige me with your haste. I think I feel the
[4913.94s -> 4925.03s]  plague spreading. Oh law, it's in my spleen now. I can feel it. Just keep your head down when you're
[4925.03s -> 4934.55s]  in there. Marauders have taken over. We're tracking mud all over the archives. You're taking an awful
[4934.55s -> 4939.51s]  risk trusting me, you know. I could just flip. If the Marauders offer me triple what they're asking,
[4939.51s -> 4945.59s]  what you're paying me. I'm just gonna, you know, I'm giving you up. I know that, but I got nobody
[4945.59s -> 4951.43s]  else to turn to. Reed would have wrote me up. Constable would have locked me up and wrote me up.
[4952.07s -> 4958.15s]  Could have gone to see the good vicar, but I never did find my courage. Marauders don't make deals?
[4959.11s -> 4968.17s]  Well, then that's on them. You don't want to make a deal with me? Fine. You know how that goes.
[4969.85s -> 4975.54s]  All right, we got another little quest here. Let's go over here to the barber shop.
[4977.06s -> 4987.00s]  I see you're also a doctor, a medical profession. Please don't touch anything. Your hands are
[4987.00s -> 4994.52s]  probably crawling with germs. Okay. Physical hygiene recapitulates moral hygiene. Cleanliness
[4994.84s -> 5003.58s]  is next to lawfulness. I can show you my hands. Listening to you makes my head hurt.
[5009.02s -> 5017.18s]  An intimidating, dumb doctor that is a pathological liar. I like this character.
[5017.82s -> 5024.22s]  Uh, I could show you my hands. Look, here they are. No, thank you. That's quite all right.
[5025.10s -> 5029.42s]  I've seen enough body parts in my line of work. We're both doctors. I'm Conrad.
[5029.42s -> 5033.74s]  You will report to me if your hair fails to meet spacer's choice aesthetic standards.
[5034.70s -> 5037.98s]  You will also report to me in the event of your death,
[5037.98s -> 5041.02s]  whereupon I will clean and prepare your remains for interment.
[5045.61s -> 5053.99s]  Uh, payoff. Ah, gravesite fees. Silas and I had talked about this at length. I thought I'd made
[5053.99s -> 5060.95s]  it clear my pecuniary situation precludes the necessary restitutions. Uh, I don't understand a
[5060.95s -> 5068.31s]  word you said. I mean that I can't possibly pay my gravesite fees. I simply cannot afford it.
[5069.03s -> 5075.11s]  I am a blemish on the prosperity of our fair settlement. When I expire, I expect Silas to
[5075.11s -> 5085.62s]  toss my body into a ditch. I just sneezed. I don't care. Pay up. Uh, you have a very loose
[5085.62s -> 5092.20s]  definition of the word prosperity. That's some quality drama, Conrad. You should audition. Don't
[5092.20s -> 5103.61s]  be so hard on yourself. That's quality. Thank you. No, I despise the cereals. Tell Silas I can't
[5103.61s -> 5109.53s]  afford to pay and that I fully expect to have my medical rights revoked for this dereliction
[5109.53s -> 5119.64s]  with my apologies. Hmm. Hang on. Medical rights? Just give Silas an IOU. Forehead.
[5120.86s -> 5125.18s]  Hang on. What medical rights? Some time ago I fell ill with the plague. Did everybody have the plague?
[5125.18s -> 5129.58s]  By the grace of the law and through my own hard work, I'd proven worthy of treatment.
[5130.62s -> 5135.58s]  Frankly, I don't imagine I'll earn that right a second time. The barber work hasn't been
[5135.58s -> 5139.42s]  profitable, you see. I've had to keep this old place running with my own savings.
[5143.14s -> 5149.38s]  Not a bad idea, but I'd need some kind of collateral. My pair of lucky clippers.
[5150.18s -> 5154.66s]  No, that won't do. Yes, it will. Where are they? Your idea intrigues me, but I'm afraid I don't
[5154.66s -> 5161.72s]  have anything to give Silas. I'm open to suggestions. I'll let you know if I can think of anything.
[5162.92s -> 5173.85s]  Much obliged. Hmm. Okay. Are those them? Well, I'll trade you. You just take this.
[5174.49s -> 5192.09s]  Let's go check on the other one. Somebody's outside. Is it the guard? Shoot, head, rake his organs
[5192.09s -> 5208.47s]  in. Wait. It is the guard. So I have to collect from you? Fancy threads. Some kind of hibernation
[5208.55s -> 5218.39s]  suit. Wait. This is the guy I have to come collect from you. Hey, you know that money that you were
[5218.39s -> 5229.11s]  looking for? I needed from you. Give it to me. See you around. Wait. Yeah. We're talking about
[5229.11s -> 5241.29s]  collateral. No. Fuck off. Dude, I should just click, click, click. You know what I mean? But I'm not
[5241.29s -> 5256.60s]  going to. Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot. Just kill them after you do their quest.
[5256.60s -> 5265.88s]  No, I'm not just going to ruin everything. Yeah, sure. Oh, just to shoot the barber in the fucking
[5265.88s -> 5278.46s]  head. That's going to ruin the rest of the whole game. There's the canary. I almost just
[5278.46s -> 5289.80s]  accidentally fired the gun. What's in the canary? Let's take a look at the logs. The Edgewater
[5289.80s -> 5294.68s]  Saltuna canning facility strictly adheres to Spacer's Choice standards of health and safety.
[5295.32s -> 5299.08s]  Schedule your sick leave with your Spacer's Choice foreman and or supervisor.
[5300.04s -> 5313.83s]  Am I just using the computer or whoops? Dehydrated water tablets? No, I'm no, no.
[5323.19s -> 5323.91s]  Money.
[5329.05s -> 5332.25s]  I'm guessing you're the foreman. Grave site fees I'm here to collect.
[5333.13s -> 5339.29s]  Shit, Silas still on about that. Here, take the fees. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell Reid I
[5339.29s -> 5344.36s]  was late on my payment. I'm gonna tell him. These papers aren't signed in your name.
[5345.16s -> 5350.28s]  Because they're not my fees and not my grave site. Guy I worked with shot himself. I paid the bill.
[5354.15s -> 5358.87s]  Yeah, that's kind of you, I guess. I could do without the sarcasm. Wasn't acting out of the
[5358.87s -> 5364.31s]  goodness of my heart. Law requires delinquent grave site fees to be paid by the deceased party's
[5364.39s -> 5370.15s]  closest living relative, which meant me. Shame though. Eugene was a good worker.
[5371.51s -> 5375.82s]  He said they shot him. Woke up one morning and put around through his upper story.
[5375.82s -> 5379.90s]  Can't imagine why. Is this a murderer? The kid was doing all right at his desk. We all thought he
[5379.90s -> 5385.26s]  was an upstanding receptionist. Just between the two of us. I'm pretty shocked his weapon didn't
[5385.26s -> 5395.08s]  misfire. Spacer's Choice handguns aren't the most reliable. That must be tough. Eugene wasn't family.
[5395.88s -> 5403.27s]  I thought you said that you were his closest living relative. Yeah, I was the closest living
[5403.27s -> 5408.71s]  person relative to his body at time of death. I'm the one who found him, you see. So I pay the fines.
[5409.83s -> 5414.23s]  Suicide's a crime. What? The legal term is irreparable damage to company property.
[5414.79s -> 5423.21s]  What Eugene did to himself was vandalism. What? That's fucking ridiculous. What are they going
[5423.21s -> 5429.91s]  to do? Arrest his corpse? You can't be serious. You can't be serious. I'm plenty serious. In fact,
[5429.91s -> 5434.79s]  I'm a little upset Eugene didn't think things through. In other words, Edgewater would have
[5434.79s -> 5439.99s]  been penalized pretty hard. Whatever Eugene was worth as an asset, we would have had to pay out
[5439.99s -> 5450.09s]  of pocket to Spacer's Choice. Would have? You didn't? He was a person, not an asset. Well,
[5450.09s -> 5455.37s]  excuse you. I'll have you know Eugene was an asset to us all. May his atoms be commended to the law.
[5456.33s -> 5461.78s]  All I know is Silas asked me for Eugene's gravesite fees, which means he was approved for burial,
[5461.78s -> 5466.74s]  which means his papers went through, which means the town's in the clear. I'm just glad to put this
[5466.74s -> 5472.18s]  whole ugly affair behind me. Eugene can rest his bones in peace and the rest of us can get on with
[5472.18s -> 5484.09s]  our own lives. Eugene wasn't a guard, right? Because there was a couple of, one of the guards
[5485.05s -> 5500.47s]  brutally accidentally shot themselves earlier. Okay, I don't think so. Okay, I'll get back to you.
[5500.47s -> 5516.02s]  I'll let you get back to work. Thanks for the money. Decipher the code. What is it? This
[5516.02s -> 5527.74s]  computer. Personal files. Hack five. I'm a hacker too? Password tenderfoot. Password accepted.
[5527.74s -> 5535.22s]  Welcome. Personal files. Theodore buried last night. Reed asked me not to report his death in
[5535.22s -> 5540.26s]  our quarterlies. Sounds fair to me. Was asked to prepare a statement or something for the
[5540.26s -> 5543.78s]  other workers. Been thinking about it. Don't know what to tell them. Don't end up like Theodore. Do
[5543.78s -> 5553.46s]  your work. Show up. Wear a smile and you'll get your medical privileges. Is a start. I knew it.
[5554.10s -> 5566.42s]  It was a fucking murder. This was a murder. What's on your mind? I paid his burial fees,
[5566.42s -> 5571.30s]  didn't I? Let the dead sleep. No way. The person's name is Eugene. Never mind. Sorry.
[5572.26s -> 5586.10s]  Sorry for the immediate accusation. I don't even know the person's name. And I'm about to
[5586.10s -> 5592.90s]  you killed Theodore, you shot him with your own gun, and then you paid for it. The person's name
[5592.90s -> 5613.11s]  was Theodore. Not Eugene. Oh, sorry. Let's get the other money. Do people get annoyed if you
[5613.11s -> 5626.36s]  guys shoot a gun? If I just go like, all righty, I know what you what what collateral you put in
[5626.36s -> 5634.60s]  the back room or something? What is this? Letter from Phyllis. Conrad receptionist shot himself.
[5634.60s -> 5638.68s]  This is bad. Company's going to have to call it for what it is. Destruction of spacer's choice
[5638.68s -> 5643.72s]  property. Eugene was an asset and somebody has to pay his body price. This is going to ruin us.
[5643.72s -> 5648.20s]  So I was thinking that we pawn off his teeth. Eugene had a full set of gold teeth.
[5648.92s -> 5653.08s]  Heirlooms passed down his family or something. You're processing his body, right? Just stick
[5653.08s -> 5657.40s]  around and pry them out. We sell the teeth somewhere nice and quiet. Use the bits to pay
[5657.40s -> 5661.56s]  his body price and nobody's the wiser. What do you think? Don't write back. In fact,
[5661.56s -> 5664.76s]  don't talk to me at all. Just give me a special signal next time you see me.
[5665.32s -> 5675.34s]  Waggle your eyebrows. Would you look at that. Conspiracy. Conspiracy to commit to commit
[5675.34s -> 5683.46s]  teeth fraud. Got you. Where's the body? Light. Oh, wait a minute. What do you have?
[5684.18s -> 5702.14s]  What's that? How much DPS do I have? Oh, it's the same gun. Okay, so the buried without the teeth.
[5703.34s -> 5714.58s]  I got my eye on you. You're gonna owe a lot more than like 30 bucks. Oh, shit. I didn't mean to do
[5714.58s -> 5726.47s]  that. Okay, so you can't don't aim guns at people's heads. Got it. So the long tomorrow.
[5727.43s -> 5736.70s]  All right, a small grave matter. So with Ludwig, he's stationed as a guard at the landing pad
[5736.70s -> 5750.79s]  southeast of Edgewater. Okay. But I want to go to like the graveyard. Talk to Conrad. Should I though?
[5750.79s -> 5755.34s]  I feel like I shouldn't. I feel like that's not going to work. What can I do for you?
[5760.44s -> 5765.48s]  Oh, I'm not medical smart enough. I know about Eugene. Why not use his teeth as collateral
[5765.48s -> 5779.08s]  free gravesite fees? You know about Eugene. How? I don't know. Were you snooping around in my things?
[5779.64s -> 5786.20s]  Or was it just dumb luck? Eugene's golden teeth were a family heirloom representing three
[5786.20s -> 5792.44s]  generations of poor dental hygiene. Bullshit. He took them to his grave. Bullshit. No, he didn't.
[5793.40s -> 5799.86s]  They I'm sure they were probably worth a few bits. More than a few. Those teeth were his personal
[5799.86s -> 5807.06s]  savings. I can't ask Silas to dig up a man's body and pry a few teeth loose from his jaw
[5807.06s -> 5816.71s]  just to pay my bills. Can I? I don't care. I'm just here to collect your dues.
[5817.51s -> 5827.34s]  Uh, yeah. Yes, I suppose I must. Here you are. Gravesite papers are fixed with my signature
[5827.42s -> 5836.94s]  and an IOU. I'm told he killed himself. What happened? Eugene was not a suicide. He put a
[5836.94s -> 5842.62s]  bullet in his brain. Yes, but that's largely a technicality. I was the one who prepared Eugene's
[5842.62s -> 5848.70s]  body for interment. I discovered symptoms of the plague on his corpse and I discovered medicine in
[5848.70s -> 5855.90s]  his pocket. Lots of medicine. Eugene overdosed on Adrena time, which is known to cause psychosis
[5855.90s -> 5860.70s]  and paranoia as possible side effects. The paranoia drove him to take his own life.
[5864.89s -> 5871.37s]  It's a miracle of bureaucracy. If Eugene's death were filed as a suicide, we'd all pay the price
[5871.37s -> 5877.37s]  for his crime. We can all thank our lucky stars that young Eugene was hopped up on medication and
[5877.37s -> 5883.53s]  suffered its predictable side effect. I included it all in my official report. I'd like to think I
[5883.53s -> 5888.17s]  saved Edgewater a great deal of money. We never could have paid the fines associated with a
[5888.17s -> 5893.78s]  suicide. I was responsible for this. I'm a pretty good liar. I could probably go lie to them and
[5893.78s -> 5917.45s]  take care of everything. Thanks for the money. All right, let's go to Ludwig. Capitalism bad.
[5921.05s -> 5925.13s]  Hungry to roasted turkey dinner good. What are you saying?
[5941.99s -> 5948.86s]  All right, Ludwig. This is kind of fun just kind of walking around and investigating and
[5948.94s -> 5965.59s]  talking to people. It's really it's doing it for my koala brain. All right, you. Thank the law.
[5966.47s -> 5971.35s]  I've been repositioning backup for months. Guess the boss finally came to his senses.
[5971.35s -> 5977.19s]  I just shot all these people. Well, let me see your rifling stance. I want to make sure you're up to
[5977.19s -> 5985.43s]  snuff. What do you want? Are you okay? You seem confused. Graveside fees cut to the chase. I told
[5985.43s -> 5988.47s]  Silas I'd pay my dues if he agreed to join the resistance.
[5989.83s -> 5997.98s]  Guess this means he's finally heard the calling. You seem confused. I'm talking about mechanical
[5997.98s -> 6010.34s]  soldier cold heartless automatons made of iron and lies. Well, fuck me. Oh, they mean to. Just
[6010.34s -> 6018.74s]  you wait auto mechanical auto creatures forged in the fires of malevolence.
[6019.38s -> 6025.14s]  I seen them over by the old power plant clattering about firing at the birds
[6026.02s -> 6032.82s]  orchestrating their uprising when the swarms of mechanicals come clanging on over that hill.
[6032.82s -> 6040.50s]  Where will you be cowering beneath your cot or standing shoulder to shoulder with the resistance?
[6044.38s -> 6052.09s]  What can I do to stop the coming apocalypse? You can gird yourself in the armor of righteousness,
[6052.09s -> 6058.41s]  soldier. From this moment on, you are a proud member of the resistance.
[6058.97s -> 6064.25s]  Right, did I just join a reputation around the junkyard just behind our beloved town?
[6065.29s -> 6068.81s]  The scout must not be permitted to return to its base of operations.
[6069.61s -> 6071.77s]  Cross it off and report back.
[6077.45s -> 6081.37s]  Mechanicals got a weak spot in their midsections. I think the technical term is
[6082.33s -> 6088.25s]  the blue glowy square thing. And I put my hand up and put it up my mouth and go,
[6100.86s -> 6106.41s]  All right, so now let's I got a lot of random quests now. All right, I have that. What about
[6106.41s -> 6113.67s]  stranger in a strange land? Collect money from a few workers. You need to find a power regulator
[6113.67s -> 6123.83s]  die robot. Ludwig Miller. Okay, spotted a forward scout of the mechanical army north of the landing
[6123.83s -> 6136.20s]  pad. Let's do it. Let's go do it. I'm ready. There's a volcano in this game.
[6138.60s -> 6145.02s]  Instant letter grid. Can I play with the lava like in those YouTube videos that you relax to?
[6145.82s -> 6166.62s]  It looks like putty, like hot silly putty. Cheese. Hit cartridge. Slaw. And what's this?
[6169.54s -> 6178.97s]  Kane Van Acker. Spacer's Choice Ethologist. Assigned to Terra 2. This week I've decided to study
[6179.85s -> 6188.10s]  the terroir mating habits. The female terroir's leave their nesting area in the morning or
[6188.10s -> 6192.34s]  returning afternoon with random objects, typically something shiny or bright. Then they build displays
[6192.34s -> 6196.74s]  with these objects and perform what I can only describe as a dance for an audience of males.
[6196.74s -> 6200.74s]  If a male likes what it sees, the two go off and nest together in one of the nearby trees.
[6200.74s -> 6204.42s]  Gerald, if you're reading this, I'm done waiting for you. Collect my things and meet me at the
[6204.42s -> 6207.46s]  next site. And don't be late. I expect punctuality from my assistants.
[6209.06s -> 6217.56s]  There's the assistant. Okay. Wait, why am I, why am I, I'm under attack?
[6218.36s -> 6225.93s]  How am I, am I under attack? I'm not even under attack. What are these? Oh wait, this is,
[6225.93s -> 6256.78s]  these are the birds. Can we just watch them? Uh, I was under attack. I'm sorry, but I was
[6256.78s -> 6274.42s]  actually under attack. All right, let's go. So there's a scout over here. Here's the scout.
[6275.14s -> 6300.04s]  Should I sneak up on it? Damn it. Hello? Searching for repair bay error. Navigation systems failed.
[6300.04s -> 6313.37s]  Unable to comply. I think a good smack won't fix. Navigation systems operational. Optimal
[6313.37s -> 6321.56s]  path toward repair bay detected. Initiating self-diagnostics. Whoa, hey, don't you owe me
[6321.56s -> 6328.28s]  something for the repairs. Spacer's choice reminds all colonists that serving the Spacer's choice
[6328.28s -> 6336.76s]  family is the highest possible reward. I have been programmed to deliver this pre-approved message.
[6338.65s -> 6356.87s]  All right, bye. Well, that was easy. Transmit cartridge. Kill it. No, why do I kill it?
[6360.28s -> 6365.16s]  Gained its trust. Quest is to kill it. But why, but for what? I need to know why.
[6367.99s -> 6381.34s]  I don't just kill people and things for no reason. Got a pretty good shot, though. It's for the robot
[6381.34s -> 6389.03s]  takeover. You're on, I've joined the resistance. Well, I'm just gonna lie to him. Bring us honor,
[6389.03s -> 6396.52s]  soldier. You won't have to worry about that scout anymore. You beat that scout to scrap with its own
[6396.52s -> 6403.34s]  legs? Pulled its optic cables out its headcase? Actually, don't tell me. Rather use my imagination.
[6404.30s -> 6411.18s]  You're a passing, fair soldier, I will confess. 857. But you are one, and the enemy is Legion.
[6412.14s -> 6419.02s]  What you need is a new weapon, a weapon to strike fear in their cold mechanical hearts.
[6420.74s -> 6428.10s]  Cantina, lavatory, behind one of the toilets. That's where I've kept it hidden all these years.
[6429.06s -> 6434.82s]  All right. You hide your secret weapon in a bathroom. Sharp, ain't it? The lavatory is the
[6434.82s -> 6441.94s]  very last place a mechanical has need to enter. I mean, it's, it's an accurate statement.
[6442.82s -> 6447.64s]  On the double, soldier. Don't want the bartender poking around in there with a mop.
[6449.48s -> 6465.19s]  All right, level three. All right, more lying. So at 40, scramble duration plus seven seconds.
[6466.15s -> 6477.38s]  Coward duration, terrify area of effect, ranged. So what is it? Handguns at 40,
[6478.02s -> 6487.99s]  handgun critical damage. Oh, absolutely. Plus 50% long guns. All right, I need to start doing some
[6489.30s -> 6498.38s]  other shit here. Medical, right? 28, should I? Yeah, medical, stupid doctor.
[6502.17s -> 6505.37s]  Leadership. Yeah, I want to be like a dumb engineer, doctor, scientist.
[6506.41s -> 6510.57s]  Three medical, but what is the, in brackets, how is that being affected by something else?
[6516.98s -> 6536.47s]  Dumb detective doctor. It's the suit. Peter. All right, I'm going to have 10 medical because I can
[6536.47s -> 6550.10s]  use. All right. And then we're going to put the other, maybe I'll just keep doing it, do it again.
[6551.70s -> 6572.87s]  Or just do this and then a couple more. All right. Good. Good. Let's do a stupid engineer,
[6572.87s -> 6587.19s]  stupid doctor, stupid scientist. That doesn't make any sense. Stupid, fucking idiot, dumb,
[6587.19s -> 6597.32s]  fucking idiot, fucking doctor, dumb fucking scientist. All right, we're going to find the
[6597.32s -> 6611.96s]  weapon. I hope it's a one-handed weapon. Is it one-handed? The latest report. The part that
[6611.96s -> 6623.26s]  said we making our quotas. Is this the bathroom? I'm here to use the bathroom. What the fuck?
[6626.95s -> 6650.92s]  Find Ludwig's secret weapon. But what is it? Return to Ludwig. I'll be back. Nice ammo. What
[6650.92s -> 6669.06s]  do you mean? Do I have low ammo? Oh, fucking idiot scientist. Can't even get over a railing.
[6669.06s -> 6686.42s]  Give me a break. Nice frame rate. Loser. I have a 1080. Yes, I have, I have a one omega lol.
[6688.42s -> 6692.82s]  Eight omega lol. Yes. I can't wait to see it. Please spam it. I'd love for you to do it.
[6694.18s -> 6702.58s]  Bring us honor soldier. Here's the package. Feast your eyes soldier. This here is a genuine
[6702.66s -> 6709.86s]  spacers choice injury customizing unit designed to deliver a lethal blast of electrical discharge.
[6710.66s -> 6717.86s]  I call it the hand of the law. You ever want to see a mechanical flailing around like a grounded fish?
[6717.86s -> 6722.50s]  You stick a couple thousand volts in its guts with compliments from old Ludwig.
[6724.82s -> 6730.57s]  All right, so what's next? Time's come for you to journey down into the black heart of the enemy's
[6730.57s -> 6739.13s]  camp. I'm talking about the old geothermal plant. Unfortunately, the old plant lies
[6739.13s -> 6745.37s]  outside my board given jurisdiction. You'll need to get a passcode from the boss, Reid Thompson.
[6747.13s -> 6753.59s]  I get it. You want me to go undercover as a mechanical and learn their ways.
[6753.59s -> 6760.71s]  You got plucked kid. But no, can't risk having you go native. I need you to get us the brain of a
[6760.71s -> 6767.11s]  mechanical. Well, not exactly a brain. Logic module. Anatomically speaking, what we're looking for
[6767.11s -> 6779.48s]  is a logic module. If a mechanical breaks down, the logic module fries so you can't rip one out
[6779.48s -> 6787.88s]  of its corpse. You're gonna have to find an intact model somehow. Seems simple enough. If you die
[6787.88s -> 6797.40s]  horribly, I will pour out a can of zero G to your memory. Okay, you've gotten a weapon
[6797.40s -> 6801.72s]  modification install mods at a workbench to upgrade your weapons, changing damage type,
[6801.72s -> 6808.47s]  adding a scope, improving rate of fire and more. Cool. All right, well, I'm gonna I'm gonna pee.
[6808.47s -> 6944.31s]  So I'll be right back in about two minutes. See you in a sec. Something interesting to note is my
[6944.31s -> 6953.67s]  character is very stupid. So he's only done the first tutorial story mission. I've just been
[6953.67s -> 6960.30s]  walking around looking at stuff and doing side quests for an hour. It's kind of realizing that
[6960.30s -> 6974.95s]  now. All right. Uh, so what are what objective are we on right now? Die robots speak with Reid.
[6975.67s -> 6980.44s]  Ludwig wants you to head to the region's geothermal plant for an important mission,
[6980.44s -> 6984.52s]  but to gain entry to the plant, you need to get the passcode from Reid Thompson,
[6985.08s -> 6993.29s]  who runs the town of Edgewater. I also have to return to Silas. Let's do that first.
[6994.17s -> 7016.06s]  I bet your piss is cold. I think that doesn't that mean I'm dead? That means I'm not alive.
[7017.02s -> 7027.08s]  That makes no sense. Cold pee. I mean, maybe if you like pissed into the air at like,
[7027.72s -> 7036.42s]  minus 40 degrees outside, maybe grave digging is a fine profession. Always work to be had
[7036.42s -> 7043.98s]  and nary a word of complaint out of your clients. We need to talk about Eugene.
[7044.86s -> 7056.87s]  Yeah. What about him? You first. I know you buried him. Hmm. Well, yeah, it's what I'm contractually
[7056.87s -> 7065.69s]  obligated to do. What's this about? Open your mouth. Let me see your teeth. He's got solid gold teeth
[7065.69s -> 7072.07s]  could be worse up than if you pulled him out. Yeah. Funny thing. Eugene's body ain't where it's
[7072.07s -> 7076.15s]  supposed to be. That's hilarious. We were supposed to commend his body to the earth. I had his grave
[7076.15s -> 7081.91s]  all dug up and ready. Right. And so I thought I'll just rest my eyes a bit. When I woke up,
[7081.91s -> 7089.11s]  his body was gone. Life spirited away, vanished. The footprints nearby suggested that Eugene was
[7089.11s -> 7099.75s]  stolen by marauders or he rose from the dead. Okay. Let me know if you find anything about those
[7099.75s -> 7107.11s]  fees. You run into any trouble? I'm all done paperwork fees and signatures. Reliable work
[7107.11s -> 7116.26s]  from a freelancer. That's going to take some getting used to. I don't want to be bothered
[7116.26s -> 7122.22s]  here, but I went, I went out of my way for this and I'll buy you a drink sometime.
[7124.62s -> 7132.54s]  Uh, I was hoping you'd give me like something. I kind of want you the helmet. What?
[7133.94s -> 7137.70s]  You've lost Abernathy's grave. Oh, okay. I was going to say that I fucked something up.
[7138.42s -> 7143.38s]  Uh, something more tangible. Suppose you've earned it. One good turn deserves another.
[7143.38s -> 7150.20s]  Yeah. I want more than that as I'm counting the money. Oh, Abernathy was trying to hide his
[7150.20s -> 7157.64s]  illness. Am I a tattletale? Yeah. Abernathy was sick with the plague. That's disgusting.
[7157.64s -> 7167.46s]  I shook hands with the guy. He was convinced that you knew. What? No, if I knew he was sick,
[7167.46s -> 7174.02s]  I would have had him reported. I needed his fees because of his name. Hey, for Abernathy. He was
[7174.02s -> 7186.74s]  at the top of my list. You see, I think I just sentenced that guy to death. Uh, yeah. Okay,
[7187.38s -> 7192.98s]  I should go. Your reputation with the faction has changed. If enemies are hostile, but your
[7192.98s -> 7198.28s]  reputation isn't kill on sight, leaving for a few days will calm things down. Okay.
[7199.32s -> 7210.71s]  Let's keep going. So now I'm going to do die robot. Is the cash medicine completed? Okay. Let's do
[7210.71s -> 7225.11s]  this botched. You can botch missions. All right. Speak with Reed. Let's do that. Save game. Oh,
[7225.11s -> 7228.15s]  I guess if you like shoot that guy in the head, when you first talk to him, you're not going to
[7228.23s -> 7258.04s]  do his mission. All right. Up in the top edge water. Uh, 10,000 bits just came in. That was
[7258.04s -> 7271.54s]  a 10,000 from a turtle duck. That's a $100 bit drop. Thank you. Turtleduck. That's massive bits.
[7272.34s -> 7277.48s]  Let's see. What do you say here? Hey, German, watching your streams and videos for many years.
[7277.48s -> 7280.84s]  Your content is, and has been helping me get through some real tough times of dealing with
[7280.84s -> 7284.76s]  depression and anxiety. Even when everything seems like crap, your streams never failed to
[7284.76s -> 7289.56s]  make me laugh. I'm finally on the path to getting better. So I just wanted to give something back
[7289.56s -> 7294.20s]  and thank you for bringing joy to all of us. That's I'm really great. That's awesome to hear
[7294.20s -> 7298.36s]  that you're starting to get better. That's the most important thing in this whole message here.
[7301.67s -> 7313.16s]  That's great news. Thank you so much for the $100. It's never necessary to do that.
[7314.04s -> 7328.52s]  I appreciate it. Nonetheless, I wish you happy days and happy health. Thank you so much for your
[7328.52s -> 7337.40s]  insanely huge amount of monetary contributions that you just dropped. But what about the nighttime?
[7342.84s -> 7350.57s]  That too. All right. Where am I going? This music sounds like breaking bad.
[7353.00s -> 7363.77s]  Yeah, it does. That's insanely accurate. How do I get up to the, I need to go up in like an elevator
[7363.77s -> 7380.54s]  or something. Is there an elevator down here? Down the level? Jesse. No, this one right here.
[7382.06s -> 7399.59s]  Look at the map. Look at the map, Jesse. Grease monkey, Argo. I'm sorry, Mr. Thompson, sir.
[7400.39s -> 7405.99s]  You asked why it's taking so long to fix. The answer's technical. Don't apologize. Just
[7406.63s -> 7412.47s]  try using small words. Seems we've got a guest. Hi. Really now Parvati, I do wish you'd spoken up.
[7413.19s -> 7419.19s]  I do apologize. I was given no forewarning of your arrival. Look at those motocross gloves.
[7421.03s -> 7424.63s]  Are you Reed? I was told I should talk to you. You must be the town boss. I'll wait until you
[7424.63s -> 7430.89s]  finish that. You were saying Miss Holcomb. It's just what Bess needs is a proper refurbish.
[7431.45s -> 7439.21s]  I can bandage her up and what all, but she's just old. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'll, I'll do better.
[7440.01s -> 7446.09s]  And I do wish you'd stop referring to our cannery as Bess. Personification of company property is
[7446.09s -> 7451.85s]  strictly contrary to the spacer's choice code of conduct. My apologies. I am not in the habit of
[7451.85s -> 7458.73s]  allowing my guests to witness such a rowl. Now, what can I do for you? Well, you're very clearly
[7458.73s -> 7469.10s]  wearing an evil guy hat. I don't trust you because you're wearing this hat. It's that brimmed hat
[7469.10s -> 7474.58s]  that has the rounded top. If this was a little higher and squared, you'd, you're, you're a
[7474.58s -> 7478.42s]  billionaire. You're like an eccentric billionaire, but no, you're a bad guy with this hat on.
[7480.06s -> 7484.86s]  Uh, I should, that's, I, we can start with introductions. I'm didn't know. I'm not,
[7484.86s -> 7490.46s]  that's wrong. Are you Reed? I'm Reed Thompson, outpost administrator. I cannot help but notice
[7490.46s -> 7499.85s]  you are not in uniform. Shut up. Idiot. Uh, uniform. What are you talking about? Shirt,
[7499.85s -> 7504.57s]  pants, work boots, company approved colors. I looked down. I'm just naked. Honorable apparel
[7504.57s -> 7513.18s]  of a lawyer worker. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Mr. Reed. I didn't realize. Uh, let's skip the small talk.
[7513.18s -> 7519.14s]  I've got a ship. It needs a power regulator. I think you made the wrong idea. Uh, I, I'll wait.
[7519.14s -> 7526.82s]  I need my, I need that, but I also need the, yeah, I need a- Only regulator we've got is
[7526.82s -> 7531.62s]  hooked up to the town transformer. Mr. Thompson ain't liable to be keen on dismantling it.
[7532.58s -> 7538.58s]  I beg your pardon. I am most emphatically not keen on any such thing. I can't let you have our
[7538.58s -> 7545.18s]  power regulator, but I happen to know of another one and I happen to know exactly how you may
[7545.18s -> 7554.50s]  retrieve it without frying yourself in the process. Let's hear it. There's a power regulator in the
[7554.50s -> 7561.46s]  old botanical lab. It's mostly abandoned. So all that power is being squandered. Go down to the
[7561.54s -> 7568.34s]  geothermal plant, reroute power from the botanical district over to us. Once their power shut down,
[7568.34s -> 7576.41s]  you can have their regulator and be along on your way. Wait, don't I need, I need to go here
[7576.41s -> 7582.73s]  anyways. The geothermal plant was built by our owners. Spacer's choice lit up the whole veil
[7582.73s -> 7588.55s]  once upon a time. Most of the veil is now abandoned. All that power is going to waste.
[7591.86s -> 7603.03s]  Uh, and you want all that power going to your canary. We could use the power. Canary's been
[7603.03s -> 7608.87s]  struggling. If we don't ramp up productivity, the company might cut us loose. Interesting. You're
[7608.87s -> 7617.08s]  saying the, um, saying it with an English accent. I guess you know the English. Yeah, that makes
[7617.08s -> 7624.63s]  sense. Uh, okay. I suppose that's fair. I was not entirely sure how to tell you this. The botanical
[7624.63s -> 7633.02s]  labs are not legally inhabited, but there are people who live there. Big subs. Big subs. Uh,
[7633.02s -> 7637.94s]  Aerosun, thanks for the five community subs. Thank you. Congratulations to all the new subs.
[7638.58s -> 7645.30s]  Thanks for the five. Uh, what a surprise. I never would have guessed. I'm not trying to pull one
[7645.30s -> 7651.11s]  over on you, friend. You were bound to run into them sooner or later. The people living in the
[7651.11s -> 7658.15s]  botanical labs, they're deserters, former workers. I need them back at their posts. I need them.
[7658.55s -> 7666.02s]  To come home. This book is a liar. If you want me to solve your deserter problems, I charge by the
[7666.02s -> 7673.30s]  head. No, I don't want you killing anyone. Least of all them. My hope is that by cutting off their
[7673.30s -> 7678.98s]  power, you will convince those deserters to come back to town before you go to the plant. I want
[7678.98s -> 7684.66s]  you to stop by the botanical lab. Oh, you didn't want me to their leader, Adelaide, tell her the
[7684.66s -> 7689.54s]  power's about to go and that it's time her band of deserters came back to town. What if they don't
[7689.54s -> 7696.28s]  want to come back? How will I recognize Adelaide? Adelaide's older than the other deserters.
[7696.28s -> 7701.56s]  She'll have floating text about her player model. From what I understand, her camp looks to her for
[7701.56s -> 7713.30s]  leadership. They must have left them for a reason. Why'd they go? That reason was me. I asked too much
[7713.30s -> 7718.50s]  and pushed too hard, but I am ready to make amends if they are willing to return to the fold.
[7719.06s -> 7725.30s]  We belong to one community, the Spacer's Choice family. If we dissolve into factions, then we
[7725.30s -> 7735.05s]  will all perish separately. Adelaide will understand that. I can't make any promises. Of course,
[7735.05s -> 7739.45s]  I understand completely. Here, let me give you the passcode to the geothermal plant.
[7739.45s -> 7744.89s]  A sign of good faith, for so politely listening to me as I ramble on. We got die robot. Are you
[7744.89s -> 7752.01s]  setting off for the Vale? Because I know my way around. I mean, in case you want to guide. I mean,
[7752.01s -> 7758.98s]  if that's all right with you, Mr. Thompson. Sir. I hesitate to part ways with Miss Holcomb, but I
[7758.98s -> 7766.01s]  cannot deny that she is talented and may prove useful to you. Okay, I can use the company. I don't
[7766.01s -> 7775.78s]  need help. Uh, it's just a, it's just a person that's just going to walk around with me and
[7775.78s -> 7783.86s]  shoot other enemies with me. So why not? Great. I got my wrenches and diagnosticators and hairpins
[7783.86s -> 7790.42s]  and engine tape. So I'm all set. Well, I am glad to hear that. Best of luck to you. And thank you
[7790.42s -> 7794.26s]  again for your help. It is a lot to ask of a stranger. She's just going to be walking around
[7794.26s -> 7801.54s]  going like, need ammo. Bang, bang, bang, bang. Watch it. Bang, bang, bang. She's going to take
[7801.54s -> 7808.44s]  like nine bullets. That's all it's for. She'll draw like the attack of two or three enemies while I
[7808.44s -> 7816.10s]  can shoot them. It's worth having. You've gained a companion. There are characters that join you in
[7816.10s -> 7821.38s]  your adventures and help in a variety of ways. Combat support. Their skills enhance your skills.
[7821.38s -> 7825.14s]  They increase your carrying capacity. You can unlock special companion combat abilities with
[7825.14s -> 7832.02s]  the inspiration skill. Right. Like I said, it's someone to walk around with you and just absorb
[7832.02s -> 7844.09s]  enemy attacks. Wait, I'm trying to like open his private door. Oops. I thought that was the way
[7844.09s -> 7854.50s]  out. All right. Now let's, let's go. I got it. Let's go get the logic module. Are you coming with me?
[7855.06s -> 7861.24s]  What do you have for skills? How do I check? We better clear out of Mr. Thompson's office
[7861.24s -> 7868.86s]  before we talk. I mean, you could have not said that right in front of him. Now he knows we're
[7868.86s -> 7883.08s]  going to talk about him. Save the game and shoot. I'm not, why would I do that? My character does
[7883.08s -> 7891.40s]  not have any inspiration to do that. We better clear out of Mr. Thompson's office. Are you really
[7891.40s -> 7901.06s]  that paranoid? Well, I guess maybe this cameras. Sorry. What? Can we chat? Oops. Companions. I
[7901.06s -> 7907.64s]  thought you said no. I, you just want to get out of here and you likely don't want to tag along like
[7907.64s -> 7914.60s]  me. It's just Mr. Thompson has his own view on matters on account of it's his job and what all,
[7914.60s -> 7924.66s]  but that's not the only side of the tale. That's just black masking tape over the top. There's
[7924.66s -> 7928.50s]  you can't, there's nothing. There's no visual here. You can't see through these. There's a costume.
[7929.14s -> 7938.18s]  Who's this a costume of? All right. Uh, this is about the deserters. If I wanted to deal with
[7938.18s -> 7949.21s]  nuance, I wouldn't be this heavily armed. Let's go. She's cosplaying as
[7951.86s -> 7958.26s]  Parvati from Outer Worlds. If I want to deal with this, I want to just go do the quest.
[7959.78s -> 7964.18s]  I don't really, I don't really want to talk. You're a, you're a companion right now. I'm going to,
[7964.18s -> 7966.98s]  this is probably going to be another companion in like an hour that I'm going to replace you with.
[7967.54s -> 7970.90s]  So I know you're going to tell me your entire story. I don't really want to hear it.
[7971.46s -> 7982.04s]  I mean, no, this is Mr. Thompson. The person's a gear. It does its job quiet. Like if it squeaks
[7982.04s -> 7988.92s]  or stutters, it gets replaced. The deserters are decent folk. I knew some of them before they left.
[7988.92s -> 7995.94s]  Okay. This town's got issues. I don't blame him. It's hard here, especially for them that don't fit
[7995.94s -> 8003.02s]  in so well. We're one big spacer's choice family, but every family's got the one the rest whisper about
[8003.98s -> 8009.90s]  Mr. Thompson's aiming to take away their power. They'll have no lights to see nor heat to cook.
[8009.90s -> 8015.34s]  They'll be at the mercy of marauders or worse. I think you should talk to the town's vicar about
[8015.34s -> 8026.84s]  it. Max, his name is. Okay. I'll think about it. What do we need to talk to the vicar about?
[8026.84s -> 8032.36s]  Flipping a switch in your power mill. About if what Mr. Thompson proposes to do is upright,
[8033.08s -> 8039.80s]  leaving Ms. McDevitt's folk to their fate, their neighbors, Kim. And maybe he can think of something
[8039.80s -> 8046.36s]  else to try. Something we ain't. He used to go walking outside town. Maybe he found something
[8046.36s -> 8067.22s]  that'll help. It's just an idea. That's all. I'll think about it. Should I talk to this person?
[8068.02s -> 8077.22s]  Comes now the power. Okay. Party wants to visit the town's vicar. She's a little uncertain about
[8077.22s -> 8096.04s]  the task. Where are they? Where are they? Where's the where's this person? Where are we headed?
[8096.04s -> 8099.56s]  Where are they? Tell me where they are. No, we're not going to talk later. I want to talk now
[8101.02s -> 8122.17s]  in the church. There's a church. Oh, now he wants to talk. Okay. Point of there we go.
[8122.97s -> 8140.92s]  So right there. I'm just curious. I'm just curious. I want to know what's going on.
[8143.06s -> 8151.46s]  I've always felt weird in here. It's too clean. All right, let's talk. Is it you?
[8153.59s -> 8162.10s]  Yes. What is it? You're an outsider. Fantastic. Vicar Maximilian De Soto at your service.
[8162.10s -> 8168.50s]  Or Vicar Max, if you're the sort who prefers brevity. And Ms. Holcomb as well. How rare to see
[8168.50s -> 8175.22s]  you out. And with a complete stranger. Curious. Just tagging along. Vicar De Soto.
[8176.90s -> 8183.62s]  I so rarely get new people to talk to. Name your poison. Anything at all. Spiritual counseling.
[8183.62s -> 8187.38s]  This season's tossball predictions. The quickest way out of town.
[8194.62s -> 8198.36s]  Pavarti wanted to talk to you about what Reid asked us to do. How do you know I'm an outsider?
[8198.36s -> 8204.57s]  What sort of spiritual advice do you offer here? They who are not satisfied with their work are
[8204.65s -> 8212.97s]  satisfied with nothing. No. How about work fortifies the spirit. True exhaustion awaits
[8212.97s -> 8223.24s]  idle hands. I was asking what your religion is. The OSI teaches that the grand architect set a
[8223.24s -> 8228.84s]  perfect system in motion at the beginning of time. Contentment is found by accepting one's
[8228.84s -> 8238.20s]  role in that grand plan. How much to put in a good word for me with the grand architect,
[8238.60s -> 8245.56s]  unofficial like. That's not how it works. The grand architect has no concern for us beyond
[8245.56s -> 8254.02s]  setting the plan in motion. I don't get it. Obviously. Look, if we can figure out how to
[8254.02s -> 8259.86s]  read the grand plan, we can more perfectly align ourselves to it, bringing everyone peace.
[8263.46s -> 8267.78s]  Okay. Well, first there's the matter of dumb. Oh, mega wall. And animal sacrifices.
[8268.42s -> 8271.70s]  I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Don't you know how stupid I am? Why would you say that?
[8271.70s -> 8276.66s]  To truly understand the metaphysics involved takes years of study and contemplation.
[8279.06s -> 8286.79s]  We've already wanted. Okay. I thought you would talk to him. What you wanted to speak to me,
[8286.79s -> 8291.75s]  Ms. Holcomb. That's not what every time I've tried to engage you in your doing at the floor,
[8291.75s -> 8297.83s]  answering single words and slink away. I can't imagine what would be so grave as to drive her
[8297.83s -> 8310.06s]  to my mission. What has Mr. Thompson asked you to do? Okay. Why? Where's the, where's go get
[8310.06s -> 8318.44s]  groceries? Number four cop power to deserters. If you could answer quickly, we're in a hurry.
[8320.79s -> 8324.63s]  I can see why that troubles you. His Holcomb has a soft heart.
[8325.27s -> 8334.82s]  Always has. If you believe the talk, can party get that treated by a saw bones.
[8336.28s -> 8341.88s]  I see today we'll be conversing without metaphors. I guess her condition is incurable.
[8342.68s -> 8346.84s]  It's unlikely to be fatal, but she may feel more heartache than most.
[8347.80s -> 8350.60s]  Could you maybe stop talking about me like I'm some kind of weird bug?
[8351.72s -> 8360.41s]  Sorry. Oh, right. Can we wrap this up? This two or three people speaking through me.
[8362.95s -> 8367.19s]  Does she have saw bones? Hey, can we wrap this up that we got weird hurry?
[8367.99s -> 8373.50s]  What do you advise? Assuming your goal is to save as many as possible,
[8373.50s -> 8378.78s]  then you should bring everyone together, send the power to Edgewater and convince the deserters to
[8378.78s -> 8387.08s]  return to the fold. Okay. Bring everyone together, send the power to Edgewater and convince the
[8387.08s -> 8395.59s]  deserters to root. So you want me to do the thing that I was told to do. Isn't that what he wants
[8395.59s -> 8399.99s]  me to do? So you want me to do that too. I'm not doing it now. I'm going to go against it.
[8400.79s -> 8408.49s]  I'm my own president. We talked to the president. We talked to the religion president. I'm my own
[8408.49s -> 8417.42s]  president. I'm doing my own thing. I'll keep that in mind. If it were as easy as a few soothing
[8417.42s -> 8422.78s]  words in the right ears, I'm sure it would have been done already. Consider it's a challenge.
[8424.14s -> 8429.50s]  If you don't mind a bit of unsolicited advice, be cautious on your way to the geothermal plant.
[8430.14s -> 8437.26s]  It is not as safe as you might assume. I've been outside. I'm not impressed. I can handle myself.
[8438.86s -> 8443.02s]  The marauders I met when I ventured outside the walls might agree with you. Would you like to come
[8443.02s -> 8446.94s]  with me and watch? Bastards snuck up on me while I was dutifully hunting for a banned book in a
[8446.94s -> 8453.34s]  collector's library. Barely escaped with my life. But you see, one of the reasons I transferred here
[8453.34s -> 8457.74s]  was to get my hands on that heretical text. Yeah, as town president, religion president,
[8458.14s -> 8469.94s]  me president. I'd pay quite a handsome sum for the book. Really? I'll assume you want to burn it
[8469.94s -> 8479.93s]  once you get your hands on it. Why would a vicar be after a banned heretical book? I just want to keep
[8479.93s -> 8484.41s]  the writing out of layman's hands. Spell crafting lying. It wouldn't do for such information to fall
[8484.41s -> 8491.77s]  into public consumption. Seems like the authorities would be interested to hear that you're after this
[8491.77s -> 8499.32s]  contraband. Maybe I'll get your book and sell it to somebody else. I can assure you, you won't
[8499.48s -> 8504.76s]  find another willing to risk imprisonment to possess this book, nor anyone willing to pay the
[8504.76s -> 8516.10s]  price I can offer. Price? Compelling argument. Glad we see eye to eye. It's a handwritten journal,
[8516.10s -> 8521.46s]  a faded blue cover with the name M. Bakunu handwritten in the lower corner. I'll mark
[8521.46s -> 8526.74s]  where I saw it on your map. Assuming you're serious? Depends how serious you are.
[8527.70s -> 8545.46s]  Yeah. Thank you. If you retrieve it, you can always find me here. What am I stuck on? The chair.
[8545.46s -> 8569.83s]  All right. Let's go. All right. Now comes the power. Let's do it. Follow me. In all capitals,
[8570.39s -> 8591.19s]  kill a fucking NPC. Holy shit. Jesus. Why? Kill an NPC. I must be fed with bloodshed.
[8591.99s -> 8609.42s]  Am I having fun? Yeah, I'm having fun. It's interesting so far. I feel like I'm just
[8609.42s -> 8615.45s]  getting started. So I don't really have, you know, we're only like two hours into the game.
[8615.45s -> 8630.52s]  That's pretty early. He doesn't want to kill people. No, I don't want to just, I don't want
[8630.52s -> 8638.31s]  to just take a, I don't want to take a dog shit on my play through. You guys want me to like
[8638.31s -> 8647.50s]  lob a grenade into that guy's office. It's like, okay. Then I just diarrhea on my fucking play
[8647.50s -> 8662.60s]  through. All right. Am I hurt? Hey, can you be like a mind detector? Can you detect minds for me?
[8666.20s -> 8682.89s]  Wait, what does X do? All right. Should I go in here? Wait, community center. No. Who's that?
[8683.61s -> 8710.14s]  Marauder. Told you. Here we go. Watch it. Wait, attack. Good. Exactly what I thought was going
[8710.14s -> 8741.90s]  to happen. She dead. Are we all right? All right. Where's the, uh, we need to loot the bodies.
[8742.62s -> 8763.10s]  Damn it. Shush. The bodies. Assault rifle. Can I give her weapons? Does she even have a weapon?
[8764.74s -> 8778.98s]  Something you need. It's a thing. All right. Let's go. I have what I have six heels.
[8779.78s -> 8792.55s]  All right. I gotta be more careful because this is on hard bit cartridge,
[8793.35s -> 8810.20s]  light ammo and a trip blade. All right. Don't just sprint everywhere. I have to walk.
[8813.11s -> 8827.85s]  Evicted. Wait, there's a house over here. I'm like 39 bullets. Everyone's dead. Assault rifle.
[8829.93s -> 8837.34s]  Makeshift low pressure suit. What's that? Give me your company. Gear in tip top shape is expected
[8837.34s -> 8842.22s]  and something you're carrying needs repair. You can repair weapons and armor at a workbench using
[8842.22s -> 8846.70s]  weapon and armor parts. Get them a breaking down on modern items. Players with engineering skill
[8846.70s -> 8852.06s]  can repair their gear without the need of a workbench. Okay. What's wrong with me?
[8852.78s -> 8873.40s]  This needs to be repaired. Okay. I have so many of these. Can I just, was this one handed?
[8873.40s -> 8880.23s]  This is two handed. I mean, I could just use this even though, I mean, it's, that's so much more
[8880.23s -> 8897.37s]  damage to inspect. Um, how do I repair this? Armor management. No. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[8897.77s -> 8903.13s]  I'm breaking down inspect them. All right. What's this? Three armor, four armor, nine armor.
[8904.01s -> 8921.96s]  That's pretty good. Tech skills plus five. Compare it. Okay. Yeah, this is better. What does this
[8921.96s -> 8930.33s]  thing do? Stealth skills. Okay. Consumables here. You can use junk or drop your consumers.
[8931.93s -> 8938.07s]  Your emergency medical inhaler shown at the top of the screen. It uses Adreno as fuel. Sure.
[8938.15s -> 8943.00s]  Increase your medical skills will unlock more drug mixing slots. They can hold all types of
[8943.00s -> 8949.46s]  consumables, not just Adreno. Each slot is mixed into every puff of the inhaler for a combined
[8950.02s -> 8969.02s]  effect. Adreno. Wait, I can breathe in like bread. How do you inhale bread? Okay. Well, that's,
[8969.02s -> 8978.50s]  I only have one slot anyways. Modifications. Range weapon mod. Magazine changes the weapon's damage
[8978.50s -> 8992.04s]  type to shock. Okay. How do I use this? General. All right. How do I, um, how do I use this stuff?
[8992.68s -> 8999.85s]  I have to use a workbench. Okay. Right. Has to be on a workbench. All right. That's good to know.
[8999.85s -> 9013.64s]  Let me test out this right, this weapon. Uh, she's not gonna be able to cross that.
[9014.36s -> 9022.46s]  I didn't even go in this building. There's not much ammo in it. No. Ooh. Can I open this? I'm
[9022.46s -> 9035.45s]  not smart enough to open this. Evicted or can I go in? Shit. I can't open these.
[9035.85s -> 9062.98s]  Sleep. Dervish mist. That clone or something. Money. Noodles. Breathe that stuff in. Bin. Okay.
[9064.98s -> 9073.78s]  All right. So we sleep. Sleep for, no, don't sleep. Resting in a bed is relaxing and moves time
[9073.78s -> 9077.54s]  forward and in supernova difficulty, you can only rest in your bed on your ship. That way.
[9077.54s -> 9091.03s]  Oh, that's probably terrible. Sleep for a week. He's not killing everyone. Get mad.
[9092.71s -> 9102.50s]  Yeah. Get mad. I'm not killing everyone. Move along stranger. We don't want any trouble.
[9103.54s -> 9109.30s]  Well, you have a sniper rifle and we're standing right next to each other. So
[9110.10s -> 9116.02s]  I'm at the advantage. I don't know you. Whatever you're looking for. It ain't here. Move along.
[9116.98s -> 9124.02s]  I'm looking for Adelaide. I need answers. Answers, huh? You must be one of those
[9124.02s -> 9132.81s]  philosophicals. Already got ourselves one of those. I'm looking for the geothermal plant.
[9133.37s -> 9137.61s]  Reed says something about former workers living out in the wilderness. Why would I? No, don't bring
[9137.61s -> 9145.35s]  up Reed. They don't, they probably hate Reed. Where's the plant? A geowhat? Look, plants eat
[9145.35s -> 9150.23s]  my purview. You're bitter off asking after Adelaide. Just dealing with an imbecile here. Dealing with
[9150.23s -> 9160.95s]  idiots. I'm at, I'm of an intelligence level higher than this. You don't know what a geothermal
[9160.95s -> 9183.99s]  plant is? Wow. Unbelievable. Do you? No. But I can pretend to. We've all got problems.
[9191.66s -> 9196.78s]  Lady named Zoe went missing some nights ago. Just up and vanished without a trace.
[9196.78s -> 9202.22s]  The quick turn. Now I'm pacing around wondering if marauders got to her. I'll go look.
[9204.38s -> 9209.90s]  I'll keep an eye out. It's not like Zoe to go wandering. Figured she might be out scavenging,
[9209.90s -> 9214.06s]  but that ain't exactly her talent. Can't imagine where she's gone.
[9214.78s -> 9217.82s]  Hale's a wide place. She could be anywhere.
[9221.82s -> 9233.02s]  Wow. Holy shit, that's horrendous. Could do without the gallows humor.
[9246.41s -> 9253.13s]  All right, where is it? This is a deserter. If you're hungry, Stefan's got supplies.
[9256.04s -> 9293.32s]  So do you. Oops. Oh no, you, oh no, okay. And I want to sleep in your bed. Thief. No, I, look,
[9293.32s -> 9308.01s]  I'm only a thief when I can't be seen doing it. That sounds pretty good. All right. Chicken.
[9324.15s -> 9328.07s]  If you're hungry, there's meat turning on the spit outside. If you're bearing illness,
[9328.07s -> 9330.71s]  find a place to lay your head down and I'll fetch you a poultice.
[9332.15s -> 9336.39s]  Whatever your troubles. Can you pet chicken? No. Leave them at the gates and be welcomed here.
[9337.27s -> 9347.02s]  Any questions, dear? What's that smell? That'd be the garden, dear. You're standing
[9347.02s -> 9355.18s]  in a garden. Also fertilizer. So mind your boots. Excuse me, Ms. McDevitt. Sorry. It's just,
[9355.98s -> 9363.45s]  you got such pretty trees in here. Why thank you. You're Robert's girl, aren't you?
[9364.33s -> 9371.53s]  I remember when you were but a sprout. Thomas speaks of you often. I want attention. Talk to
[9371.53s -> 9377.61s]  me. You should try some of my tobacco. That's my game. I brew it in an old spittoon,
[9377.61s -> 9387.99s]  but it's been cleaned. Uh, it looks like you made a home for yourself here. A home for anyone who's
[9387.99s -> 9393.91s]  ever turned their backs on Edgewater. A home for those of us with nowhere left to go and nothing
[9393.91s -> 9400.87s]  to lose. So like the spores of the puff ball cast on the wind and a lighting on fresh soil,
[9401.51s -> 9413.72s]  we put down new roots. That's too dumb. Even if you were dumb, you wouldn't save this.
[9419.94s -> 9427.77s]  My goodness. All right, you just charming. You have to do the tuber choice. Uh,
[9427.77s -> 9434.17s]  I was sent to make peace with you. Reed Thompson, you here on behalf of that cold-eyed reptile?
[9434.97s -> 9445.21s]  Let's hear it. What's Reed's idea? He's a lizard? I didn't know that. Oh, you're living off power
[9445.21s -> 9453.85s]  that belongs to the town. Come back to the cannery. That's about it. Reed asks you to
[9453.85s -> 9457.13s]  consider coming back to town. He's willing to make amends. Something about coming back to town or
[9457.13s -> 9463.53s]  losing power. I wasn't really listening. I can't say I blame you. Reed is positively soporific.
[9464.57s -> 9468.89s]  Like everything else that comes out of Edgewater, that peace offering is canned.
[9469.85s -> 9472.81s]  I and my own are living just fine out here by ourselves.
[9476.94s -> 9485.93s]  This is serious. I'm about to cut off your power. This is serious. You're doing this for Reed.
[9487.13s -> 9494.15s]  For money. For money. Money. Your camp has a power regulator. I needed to repair my ship.
[9495.40s -> 9510.60s]  Seemed like the right thing to do. My reasons are my own. Just like my Twitter profile. It's
[9511.48s -> 9517.34s]  in my biography when you go to my Twitter. If you're going down to the plant, you should
[9517.34s -> 9525.02s]  divert power away from Edgewater and toward our end of the grid. Think about it. You'd be liberating
[9525.02s -> 9532.62s]  an entire town from a lifetime of service to that odious cannery. Seems the sort of thing a hero
[9532.62s -> 9544.15s]  would do. Hero to you maybe. I'm looking for a power regulator. Reed promised me yours.
[9545.43s -> 9550.47s]  Cannery's got a regulator. You want ship parts, you ought to rip them out of the cannery's guts
[9550.47s -> 9560.60s]  and leave us be. Let's say I help you. What happens to Edgewater? Life in Edgewater grinds
[9560.60s -> 9568.52s]  to a halt. The cannery shuts down. Workers desert in droves and our own little camp grows and thrives.
[9569.72s -> 9589.03s]  Y'all doing drugs here? Like you doing drugs? Because I trust you will listen to your conscience.
[9590.87s -> 9601.08s]  Vivardi, what should we do? Where are we headed? I don't know. You tell me.
[9602.12s -> 9610.70s]  You mean about the mission being too clean? Might as well leave. All right, so we got
[9611.58s -> 9624.94s]  a long gun. What's a long gun? A sniper? What do I want here? 60. Dialogue. I want to be able to lie
[9624.94s -> 9647.93s]  better. Is it assault rifles? At 20, medicine. I love the second drug mixing slot. Improve your
[9647.93s -> 9663.94s]  weapons and armor in the workbench. Okay, I want that second slot. Yep, that looks good. A new perk.
[9665.38s -> 9678.82s]  I have one perk point. Vendor prices. I'm just going to steal whatever I can't buy. So what's
[9678.82s -> 9683.85s]  the point? You take better care of your weapons and armor than most people. That's probably good.
[9684.65s -> 9697.30s]  Or a faster sprint. Damage when alone in a party plus 25% damage when alone. Goodbye.
[9699.78s -> 9706.81s]  Sprint is really good though. Yeah. Yeah, faster sprint speed. That's true.
[9711.22s -> 9719.03s]  All right. Let's do... First, let's get this shit out of the way.
[9726.07s -> 9731.11s]  I can neither divert the power to Edgewater or I can not divert the power to Edgewater.
[9731.67s -> 9760.62s]  We have to make a decision. Look, if I'm going to give you power, then I may as well take all the
[9760.62s -> 9775.93s]  money. Because, I mean, look, that's fair. I do the really dangerous mission and I sacrifice
[9775.93s -> 9780.57s]  myself and make it so you get power diverted to you. But I take all the money in your houses.
[9783.72s -> 9796.52s]  That's fair. Zoe's journal. Well, today's the day, Zoe. Today is the day you take your destiny in
[9796.52s -> 9801.00s]  your own hands. I've been listening to Grace talk about the Marauder threat. Bands of wild
[9801.00s -> 9806.52s]  free-spirited bandits living in camps out in the hills. Barrel fires probably mounted the heads
[9806.52s -> 9813.08s]  of their enemies on spikes as a warning to people like me. Three of any rules. I bet they could take
[9813.08s -> 9820.28s]  the whole region. I've been talking away some of our food. I've come to some spare cans of tuna.
[9820.28s -> 9827.35s]  It should last me a couple weeks. So you went there willingly. I got odds those Marauders will let
[9827.35s -> 9831.51s]  me throw in with them if I dangle a couple syringes of Adrena time before their eyes.
[9832.07s -> 9838.71s]  This is going to be great. Bandit Queen Zoe's origin story has just begun. I'm going to have
[9838.71s -> 9845.98s]  a whole gang of Marauders at my back. Maybe I can even score some Rizzo's. Well, that's new info.
[9846.62s -> 9857.02s]  What about this? No more edge water for me. No more cannery. No more jumpsuits and gloves.
[9857.02s -> 9861.50s]  Yes, ma'ams. And would you like another? I don't know why I'm writing this down for
[9861.50s -> 9867.78s]  prosperity's sake. Fuck the cannery. I don't think I'll ever have to look back in this journal. Who
[9867.78s -> 9875.62s]  cares? I'm going to go be a Marauder. And so I got sick. Everybody gets sick. Well, okay. I got sick
[9875.62s -> 9879.62s]  and I grabbed a little too much Adrena time. Is that really a crime? Got to treat myself when I'm
[9879.62s -> 9884.66s]  sick, don't I? What have I happened to personal responsibility in surviving by one's own bootstraps?
[9885.38s -> 9889.86s]  Oh, but you misappropriated one box of Adrena time and you suddenly you're committing larceny.
[9899.46s -> 9909.70s]  Pet chicken, pet chicken, pet chicken. All right. What about let me take a look at this stuff here.
[9909.70s -> 9918.97s]  We're going to die robot, which is over here. This is in the town or it's down in the do I have to
[9918.97s -> 9931.51s]  go back down there? Isn't like the lab, wasn't it? Let me see the geothermal plant in the northwest
[9931.51s -> 9941.74s]  portion of the region. So no, it's out of here. Let's go do this first. Is there a way I can
[9941.74s -> 9957.43s]  leave here quickly? Oh, he used to follow me around. Workbench. Wait. No, that's just a
[9957.43s -> 9968.07s]  regular bench. Where's workbench? There it is. Get out of my way. All right. Let's do this one.
[9970.10s -> 9980.71s]  Install installed modifications. Install. This is a shock weapon. Modify light pistol with the mag
[9980.71s -> 9985.59s]  to zap. Mods can't be recovered after installation. If you install this modification of this slot,
[9985.59s -> 9991.74s]  the current one will be destroyed. No, wait, what's in it now? Magazine size plus 50%.
[9992.78s -> 10009.24s]  What's going to make the DPM, the damage permitted up? Yeah, let's do it. Fuck it. So wait,
[10009.24s -> 10026.79s]  now I can do this. Wait, where to go? Is that it? No modifications. Magazine zero. Oh, it's
[10026.79s -> 10040.95s]  damaged. Okay. How much does it take to repair? Repair is E. It takes more damage. Oh, eight.
[10040.95s -> 10052.66s]  Yo, I only have 21 weapon parts. Where's the other pistol though? Am I out of my mind?
[10053.46s -> 10070.18s]  Wasn't it? Didn't I have two pistols to modify? Oh, this is the companion's weapons. How do I
[10070.18s -> 10085.56s]  take these from you? Can I take these? I need this. All right. Give me this. All right. Let me
[10085.56s -> 10098.25s]  prepare. How do I take stuff from you? Inventory. General. Quests. Junk. Can I go to her inventory?
[10100.62s -> 10122.54s]  Click her name at the top. Uh, what do you mean her name at the top? Junko. Where? Oh my God. It's
[10122.54s -> 10128.76s]  like another, I thought it was going to be like another inventory. Okay. Here's the companion.
[10128.76s -> 10132.12s]  I didn't know it was going to be like on the menu. I thought it was going to be like up here,
[10132.12s -> 10143.58s]  like inventory, like, oh, Pavardi's menu. Whatever. Give me this. Okay. How do I take it off?
[10146.62s -> 10151.80s]  Here. I'll take this instead. I have to replace it with something. Take the machine gun. Give me
[10151.80s -> 10163.83s]  this back. Actually give me this too. You take this shitty stuff. I want your stuff. Okay. Good.
[10163.83s -> 10173.48s]  There we go. Now it's good. Can I make ammo or anything? Okay. Repair. I don't need to do that.
[10173.48s -> 10183.29s]  Tinker. What's tinker? Just make you do more damage? Tinker. Yeah, let's do it. You want to
[10183.29s -> 10199.58s]  tinker the light pistol? Yeah. Tinker it again. Tinker it again? Yeah. No. That's good. Let's break
[10199.58s -> 10208.81s]  this shit down. Uh, break down. What do you got? This crap. Yeah, this is a bunch of crap. Get rid
[10208.81s -> 10218.44s]  of it. Junk. Crap. All right. I think I'm good. Nice. Now this thing does more damage and it's
[10218.44s -> 10229.83s]  a shock weapon. I've already used your favorite companion. That's cool. Save the game. Let's go
[10229.83s -> 10242.07s]  get that thermonuclear fast driving car. All right. Let's go. Wait. I can go this way. It's still a
[10242.07s -> 10259.58s]  light pistol. Oh, Megalo. Well, whatever. You can laugh. I'm not. Should I not go this way?
[10260.30s -> 10291.66s]  Do I have no life regen? No, I do. It's very slow though. What about my food? Oh, okay. Apples.
[10292.54s -> 10324.10s]  Cool. You can level up the health regen. That's not a bad idea. Oh, fuck off. I knew you're going
[10324.10s -> 10338.15s]  to make it. Whoa. Attack. That thing is, there are five damage types. Physical plasma, corrosion,
[10338.15s -> 10342.55s]  shock, and enray. Some enemies are horrible, but yes, I know. Shock is better. This thing
[10342.55s -> 10372.04s]  has a lot of health. How do I revive? All right. Let's go. Ooh, helmet. Salt rifle. A small
[10372.04s -> 10375.80s]  percentage of weapons and armor you find are considered pristine. They have more durability
[10375.80s -> 10393.50s]  and they're just really cool. Good to know. What do we got here? Hack. Ooh, can I hack it?
[10395.82s -> 10410.47s]  I need four hacking devices. That's a lot of stuff. Sawed off shotgun. A sight. Damn it. All right.
[10413.42s -> 10424.92s]  Dumb to hack. Let's sneak. Oh, fuck. There's a lot of people. All right. Is there like a
[10424.92s -> 10430.82s]  Maylake Hill? Can I sneak up on these guys and like just let their mechanical throats?
[10431.78s -> 10461.38s]  Just go out there. Why are you just going out there? You just keep, you continue to die. I only have,
[10461.38s -> 10480.44s]  how many bullets do I have? Not very many. Ooh, flywheel? Bits. Doctor. Another light pistol.
[10480.44s -> 10507.85s]  This is a hundred DPS. All right. Well, here we go. This is it. The light pistol sucks, Boomer.
[10516.04s -> 10524.81s]  I hope we're doing the right thing. Oh, who cares? All right. Vending machine. A hack skill of 20 or
[10524.81s -> 10530.28s]  higher allows you to sell items to the vending machine. Cool. You can have high rep to sell
[10530.28s -> 10538.79s]  restricted items. All right. So what do we got? Tarmac and cheese. I need bullets. Light ammo.
[10539.51s -> 10557.90s]  Yeah. Let's get some light ammo. Buy the maximum. 50 out of 50. What is this? How many of these
[10557.90s -> 10579.16s]  should I get? Five? Sell. Only 9.4 dollars? Well, I can sell this because I don't need it.
[10579.96s -> 10596.47s]  Can I not sell? Oh, is this restricted or something? Where's the sell? Sell all. Don't want to click
[10596.47s -> 10605.66s]  that. Buy and sell items with bits. The official currency. You have not unlocked the ability to
[10605.66s -> 10611.51s]  sell to vending machines. Oh, I thought, I thought I was only a certain level or something. Oh,
[10611.51s -> 10654.34s]  fucking whatever. What? Damn it. Almost. Why did it slow him over that? Can't do it yet. Use terminal.
[10654.34s -> 10660.66s]  Unlock the door. Warning, this facility is in a state of lockdown. Authorization passcode required.
[10661.22s -> 10674.15s]  Enter passcode. Uh, welcome. R. Thompson. Personal files. Personal log. That whole head. Found him
[10674.15s -> 10678.15s]  fiddling around with one of the mechanicals, so I had to write him up for tampering with company
[10678.15s -> 10682.07s]  property just in case. I'm reading this a couple days from now and feeling bad for what I've done.
[10682.95s -> 10693.24s]  Let me just remind myself that I've warned him before. Okay. Personal logs. Doesn't sit right
[10693.24s -> 10697.00s]  with me. The company's never been wrong before. The company's been replacing our guards with
[10697.64s -> 10702.12s]  auto mechanicals. This right here, I'm going to end up a chief of security with no staff.
[10702.12s -> 10708.30s]  Okay. Uh, worse has happened. Mechanicals gone crazy. Lock myself down here. Just trying to
[10708.30s -> 10711.90s]  gather my courage. Gonna make a mad dash with the control room. Might be able to shut things down.
[10714.76s -> 10719.96s]  Greeting security chief S. Tanaka. This is an automated message initiated by Spacer's Choice
[10719.96s -> 10724.95s]  Worker Safety Contingency Protocols. Security lockdown has been initiated. This is not a test
[10724.95s -> 10730.79s]  of your behavior during this lockdown. Will be reviewed during your quarterly audit. Anxiety
[10730.79s -> 10738.20s]  is a common side effect of life-threatening situations. Fight back against anxiety with an
[10738.20s -> 10747.78s]  ice cold bottle of zero G brew. Zero G brew and ale. That's good for what ails you. I can add.
[10747.78s -> 10758.25s]  All right. The door is open. There's already people coming here. Under attack.
[10759.13s -> 10790.70s]  That's, uh, where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? I think it's flying. Just take
[10790.70s -> 10807.77s]  everything. I can sort it out later. Necklace. Can I sell that? Speed grip? Well, I can't sell
[10807.77s -> 10812.81s]  it to a vending machine, but can I, can I sell it to a person? Like a town's person? Do I have to
[10812.81s -> 10826.01s]  have, do I have to hack a person's brain to sell them a weapon? Okay. Let's go. All right. You go
[10830.34s -> 10871.40s]  Z. Right there. Hold Z is what does that do? Oh, X, Z. I'm on my way. Enemy kill. How much stuff can
[10871.40s -> 10883.24s]  I even carry? I hear a noise. I hear an organic sounding noise, not a mechanical sounding noise.
[10887.19s -> 10893.50s]  Use. What the hell did that do? Do I, did I just divert power? What did I just do? Did I
[10893.50s -> 10900.76s]  divert power to the, what did I just press? I hope I didn't just like do anything.
[10912.68s -> 10919.64s]  Self diagnostics complete. Navigation systems operational. Combat systems
[10919.64s -> 10927.56s]  operational. It's not the best choice. It's the spacer's choice. Okay. Why are you not attacking
[10927.56s -> 10935.56s]  me? Hostile actions towards spacers choice. Mechanics are contrary to logical directive.
[10936.28s -> 10944.44s]  Conclusion. All hostile auto-mechanicals must be defective in compliance with spacer's choice
[10944.44s -> 10951.24s]  policy. You know what's going on. All defective auto-mechanicals must be permanently dismantled.
[10951.24s -> 10961.13s]  Please allow me to assist. All right. Affirmative. Mechanicide protocols loaded. Awaiting
[10961.13s -> 10969.10s]  confirmation. Yeah. Confirmation granted. I like the sound of that. Go for it. Go take out all
[10969.10s -> 10986.07s]  those mechanicals that are bad. Repair log. Corporate just sent a team of technicians to
[10986.07s -> 10995.14s]  conduct a complete refit of all of our mechanicals. Lore. I did routine maintenance. Found some strange
[10995.22s -> 10999.14s]  modifications to their logic modules. Somebody fucked with them and made them aggressive.
[11001.48s -> 11004.60s]  Filed the report, but my supervisor told me not to worry about it. Said the company knew
[11004.60s -> 11007.96s]  what it was doing. What did we forget about any alleged modifications?
[11008.60s -> 11014.63s]  I wrote this down so somebody would see it. Got my hands on a logic module. Time to do a little
[11014.63s -> 11026.47s]  bit of experimentation. Did you know? Borrowed a copy of the Young Spacer's Guide to Mechanical
[11026.47s -> 11030.63s]  Engineering. I think it's volume three. I need something to read down in the pit.
[11033.03s -> 11059.75s]  Pit. Okay. Logic module. Guy's down in the pit. Hop in pit. You're not real. You're not real.
[11060.55s -> 11067.03s]  He's in the pit. Where is he? Is that thing going to go kill him? All right. Where are you?
[11076.17s -> 11077.37s]  He's just down here?
[11078.17s -> 11094.09s]  Thanks for the input. Got to get it right in the belly button. Get it! Engineering 15. Shut off
[11094.09s -> 11136.58s]  the steam valve. Scientist. Oh, is it workbench? Yeah, I know about mods. Weapons and armor can be
[11136.58s -> 11147.54s]  modified. Mods can't be removed once they're used, so put them on your favorite gear. Right. All
[11147.54s -> 11159.06s]  right. So this is the Zapper. 173 damage. What can I do with this? I can't do anything. I can't do
[11159.14s -> 11173.35s]  anything. 173 damage. What can I do with this? No mods. Oh, I can. Oh, it's a scope. Should I
[11173.35s -> 11188.34s]  put a scope on a shotgun? Would that be stupid? Okay, this is gyrocyte. Spread is reduced. I mean,
[11188.34s -> 11194.94s]  yeah, this thing's pretty good. I'm probably going to use it. Whatever. This is a better scope. It's
[11194.94s -> 11206.55s]  better saturation. I'm just pretending I know what I'm talking about. All right, so let me equip that
[11206.55s -> 11214.89s]  instead. Doesn't need to be repaired. This is what I'm currently wearing. All right, what can I,
[11214.89s -> 11227.93s]  can I do something with this? All right, this needs to be on here. No, no, wrong. Is the one
[11227.93s -> 11243.16s]  that I just modified? This one. I guess I can just put it on. Let's try it. Cool. I'll try it. All
[11243.16s -> 11255.75s]  right, we're looking for that. There was a guy that was screaming. All right. Where's the
[11255.75s -> 11306.17s]  screaming? Oh, shit. Where are they? Where is it? Let me eat some food. Oh, fuck. That was actually
[11306.17s -> 11330.63s]  pretty scary. Okay. All right. I'm here. Ammo. Save it. This is too scary. Turn it off.
[11330.63s -> 11362.14s]  All right. This is where I shit on the ground. All right. All right. So that guy, where was that
[11362.14s -> 11369.88s]  guy? There was a guy like screaming. Is he up there? Security chiefs. Wait, why is him?
[11370.68s -> 11379.85s]  Security chiefs corpse. Wait, I don't think I want to use this on a locker.
[11383.98s -> 11402.17s]  No, Mr. Ouch. All right. Hold on a second. Do I, why do I have two different markers?
[11402.97s -> 11411.83s]  There's that one and then there's this one. Why are there two markers? One of them is for
[11412.87s -> 11436.01s]  move mouse over the markers to see where they are or what they are. I mean, I'm on the wrong
[11436.01s -> 11451.74s]  floor. How do I move the map up? Objective. Objective. Is this for the same objective though?
[11452.46s -> 11458.23s]  Oh, did I get baited? Oh, well. All right. Well, I'm just going to go back up here.
[11459.27s -> 11465.54s]  Aim at the markers in the world. Security chiefs corpse and logic module. Right. Because the guy
[11465.54s -> 11474.95s]  that's screaming. All right. Let's get the module. It's behind this though. How the fuck do I get in
[11474.95s -> 11492.58s]  there? Should I not be shooting you? Wait, was this the thing I activated? The corpse has the key.
[11498.41s -> 11510.47s]  I guess I could like pick the lock though. All right. Security officers corpse. I need to get
[11510.47s -> 11514.15s]  up here and down this way. So what's the correct way to go this way? I have to go up the stairs
[11514.15s -> 11518.39s]  around somehow over here and then up, I guess. I don't know this. I turned on the fucking
[11519.35s -> 11527.75s]  ooze elevator. So I guess I'm going to go. You're not real. Is there a way to go up? This is it.
[11527.75s -> 11541.51s]  This is going down. Damn it, man. This is the thing that I repaired. It's killing this guy.
[11541.51s -> 11557.94s]  It's killing him. Just kill it. No. Load save. Load save. Load save. Where is it? Which one is it?
[11557.94s -> 11571.38s]  Quick save. Quick save. Auto save. This one at 319 right here. All right. Come with me.
[11572.18s -> 11579.66s]  So I have to go all the way. I have to go down and then up. Where did he just put me?
[11580.22s -> 11596.20s]  I have to go back to that pit. All right. So wait, hold on. You're right here. Give me the key card.
[11596.20s -> 11604.30s]  Thank you. And give me your machine gun. Fine. That was hidden behind a fucking block. All right.
[11604.30s -> 11628.42s]  Now let's go over here. Spard. I can't open. What? Module. Let's go. Tactical shotgun. All right.
[11628.42s -> 11640.55s]  Pretty cool. Okay. Now I got die robot. Head back to the landing pad and deliver the logic module
[11640.55s -> 11654.54s]  to Ludwig. Got it. I got a shotgun too. Now it's either divert power or divert power. I mean,
[11654.54s -> 11666.06s]  now which one of these am I going to do? How far away is this one? It's far. All right. Let's get
[11666.06s -> 11674.42s]  out of here. Who do I want to save? What city do I care about? This is a very good question.
[11687.45s -> 11698.07s]  Pole? No, I'm going to, I'll make a decision. I mean, why am I leaving? What about the guy at
[11698.07s -> 11715.54s]  the bottom of the pit? I guess there was the guy there. Maybe I'll go look for that guy. Save him.
[11720.73s -> 11726.49s]  All right. So I got to go to the pit. He's down here. You hear him screaming. What was the way
[11726.49s -> 11739.85s]  to go? Should I just go down? What are these things even for? This is probably some other
[11739.85s -> 11746.15s]  quest or something that I didn't get before coming in here. I'm assuming. I don't know.
[11746.71s -> 11755.05s]  All right. So where's that pit? Where's the pit? Right in the middle,
[11761.45s -> 11778.71s]  back around this way and down the hall. That's the pit I'm assuming. Should I just go this way?
[11779.43s -> 11796.79s]  And down. Okay. I have to find a way down to you. I'm coming. I'm coming down.
[11797.59s -> 11826.20s]  I'll be there in a minute. For a second I thought this was the guy from the beginning of the game.
[11829.46s -> 11834.92s]  Phantoms where? You can talk? The phantoms never talked before.
[11835.64s -> 11842.18s]  I knew I shouldn't have eaten that Sprat raw. See? See Higgins? This is why you must always boil
[11842.18s -> 11852.94s]  your Sprats before ingesting. Higgins. This phantoms got a name. All right. Slow down. What's
[11852.94s -> 11856.86s]  going on? Clearly I mistook you for one of the phantoms of my imagination which terrorized me
[11856.86s -> 11863.64s]  on occasion. Chester D. Higgins. The D stands for definitely not insane. I use it as a reminder.
[11868.23s -> 11873.27s]  How long have you been down here? Hard to say. By my reckoning Higgins has been here somewhere
[11873.27s -> 11882.30s]  between two weeks and forever. My recollections a touch fuzzy these days. Okay. Oh Higgins has
[11882.30s -> 11887.98s]  been many things over the years. Sprat Wrangler, Saltuna Critic, Aether Wave Personality,
[11887.98s -> 11894.30s]  Chairman of the Board, Galactic Defender, Sissy Pig Tycoon. I've come a long way for someone who
[11894.30s -> 11902.22s]  started off as a simple engineer right here in this plant. Oh you. We have that in common. You
[11902.22s -> 11907.90s]  and I are both engineers. I specialized in auto-mechanicals, drones, sentries. That's a good
[11907.90s -> 11913.10s]  talking point. Peridum maintained, upgraded. Did it all from my old workroom just over in the next
[11913.10s -> 11928.78s]  section. Okay. Right was that before or after you became a Sissy Pig Tycoon? How do you stop? Look
[11928.78s -> 11932.86s]  I don't want to fall into any trouble with the mechanicals. If they wise up to our plans they
[11932.86s -> 11942.58s]  will come for us with prodding irons. I'm not afraid of any mechanicals. I can't even spell
[11942.58s -> 11951.16s]  mechanicals. Or you can help me and I won't feed you to the Sprats. Your call. Why 46? Spacer's Choice
[11951.16s -> 11961.82s]  sent me here to rescue you. You can trust me. Dumb and persuading is the way. You know you remind
[11961.82s -> 11967.34s]  me of myself back when I was an intergalactic adventurer. I discovered a flaw. Their hostility
[11967.34s -> 11971.74s]  levels were hardwired to maximum. There's no changing that but you could rewrite their targeting
[11971.74s -> 11977.61s]  protocols so they attack each other instead. No wonder they're so angry. Somebody messed around
[11977.61s -> 11983.21s]  with their logic modules. Yes that's exactly it. I see you're also versed in the noble art of
[11983.21s -> 11986.33s]  mechanical engineering. That wasn't dumb that was just engineering. There's a behavior control
[11986.33s -> 11990.57s]  terminal in the other room. It should have options to change how the mechanicals act
[11990.57s -> 11996.81s]  including whom they shoot at. Oh that reminds me you'll need my passcode to access the behavior
[11996.81s -> 12006.84s]  control terminal. Here let me just write it down. Okay. The tail. Definitely start with the tail.
[12006.84s -> 12014.71s]  If you're feeling adventurous the ears are a particular delicacy. Actually hang on. Forgot
[12014.71s -> 12019.91s]  what you were gonna say? Me too. Time to divert power. Uh just go fuck yourself I don't care
[12019.91s -> 12025.91s]  anymore. All right uh let's take your impact hammer because it's mine now and your lubricant
[12025.91s -> 12046.28s]  is mine. Okay do I want to save the botanical garden place or do I want to save the uh the high
[12046.28s -> 12054.58s]  taxes workers are made out of gold bars? I don't know. I'm not sure what I want to do.
[12056.89s -> 12075.10s]  How do I need to go? Reprogram the bots so they don't attack you. Did I already do that?
[12077.19s -> 12108.01s]  I did it to one of them. Uh what is it? Long tomorrow? No no no no no no. Am I going the
[12108.01s -> 12112.70s]  right way here? Do I have to like wrap back around? What was that power room?
[12122.04s -> 12142.34s]  What is it? Another one. Save the capitalists. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I have no idea
[12142.34s -> 12153.77s]  what I'm gonna do. Here we go. Do I just flip a coin? Should I let fate decide? Maybe I should
[12153.77s -> 12164.12s]  let fate decide. Redirect power. Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait did I just do it? I didn't
[12164.12s -> 12169.59s]  get a choice. Safety failures detected. High likelihood of moderate or severe structural
[12169.59s -> 12175.58s]  damage. Redirecting power is an irreversible procedure. Power redirection functions failed.
[12175.58s -> 12189.24s]  Manual override required. Please activate all three electrical track switches. What? Oh it's
[12189.24s -> 12197.70s]  those things those things I have to activate. Oh god the goo tanks. Yeah of course you're gonna
[12197.70s -> 12200.50s]  put me on a mission where I have to go activate the goo tanks. I should have just done them.
[12201.30s -> 12222.01s]  Where is this one? Over here. Got it. Okay flip a coin. Go to go to random.org and just type in
[12222.01s -> 12235.74s]  two and then press enter 50 times and then whatever it is. Once we do this there's the
[12235.74s -> 12240.78s]  Hey mister. Whoa. Look I know you want your power regulator and all. She's like wait don't do this
[12240.78s -> 12248.02s]  I'm not gonna talk to you. Do you understand what you're about to do? I know exactly what I'm doing.
[12248.02s -> 12250.90s]  Well what's your opinion? I don't think you should cut off Edgewater's power. I think it would be
[12250.90s -> 12257.30s]  cruel. Well. I'm sorry that just sort of came out all at once. Didn't she want me to do anything?
[12257.30s -> 12261.54s]  We've been losing workers year after year and corporate hardly ever sends replacements.
[12262.10s -> 12266.42s]  There's barely enough salt tuna to fill our bellies anymore but the town's got some good
[12266.42s -> 12271.94s]  people in it. Decent hard-working folk just living their lives the only way they know how.
[12273.43s -> 12279.75s]  They don't deserve to be punished. Well this isn't like Fallout 3. I'm not I'm not like nuking a city.
[12281.05s -> 12292.15s]  I'm just turning their power off. I'm just I'm just turning off their power temporarily and then
[12292.15s -> 12298.79s]  we'll figure it out. Okay Reid tells me Edgewater is going to die without workers in power. The
[12298.79s -> 12303.35s]  deserters are a community. I can't just destroy what they built. I think I'm ready to make my
[12303.35s -> 12308.15s]  decision. Sorry I didn't mean to babble off like that. I just I felt like I had to say something.
[12308.87s -> 12315.91s]  That's where it's way here. Don't worry about it. I was barely listening to you. Oh well okay then.
[12315.91s -> 12324.63s]  I made that really clear that I was very heavily listening. I'm like I'm a dick. All right here we
[12324.63s -> 12338.70s]  go. Redirect power. Safety failures. Are you sure you want to continue? Redirecting power is an
[12338.70s -> 12343.66s]  irreversible procedure. Redirect power to Edgewater. Redirect power to Botanical Laboratory.
[12344.46s -> 12374.95s]  I've got I've got my Nivea lip balm. If it lands heads is no no I'm gonna okay is it weird that
[12374.95s -> 12382.41s]  I'm just going by how much I liked traversing the town. It has nothing to do with any of the stuff
[12382.41s -> 12387.37s]  going on. It's just which town do I think is more interesting to be like walk around in.
[12388.01s -> 12409.30s]  The power regulator is now safe to remove from Botanical Laboratory. Edgewater Saltuna
[12409.30s -> 12422.94s]  Canary power regulator is now operating at optimal capacity. All right I did it. We did it.
[12423.66s -> 12438.95s]  Now give me the power regulator. Thank you. Where is it? Give me this stuff first.
[12441.11s -> 12450.65s]  Ah it's behind a door. Hold on. Access the files. Access the files. Open the door.
[12453.13s -> 12467.64s]  Where is the open door code? I don't know. Oh I don't even need one. Vending machine.
[12468.28s -> 12479.35s]  No I'm good. I'm good. Wait where's the power? Where is it? Triggered the power regulator? Is it
[12479.35s -> 12491.80s]  outside? Jerma you literally would have to only have two conversations to make the deserters
[12491.80s -> 12496.62s]  come back and then Edgewater gets better. Uh thanks for the advice person who's played
[12496.62s -> 12529.18s]  through the game already. Appreciate it. And he's wrong is he? I don't know. Wait a minute. All
[12529.18s -> 12535.50s]  right so uh where's the uh oh I have to go actually to the lab and go get it. Oh I don't
[12535.50s -> 12543.24s]  want to do that. I don't like that. I have to go I have to go into the place that I just destroyed.
[12546.55s -> 12549.91s]  I don't want to do I can't just like there's not a core that I just take
[12549.91s -> 12557.83s]  from inside the lab that's I don't like this. I'm currently I'm the I'm stuck in the like person
[12557.83s -> 12587.06s]  zoo here. You can't just text them to break up. Right but are they gonna be hostile? It's all
[12587.06s -> 12597.82s]  right. I'll just lie. Do I can I put my lie to 50 so I can just tell them I didn't do it?
[12599.85s -> 12609.72s]  Their power got diverted somehow and I'm just coming to check on them. You got your lights
[12609.72s -> 12636.15s]  are still on you're fine. No that's not a good that guy's got a rifle. Yeah I know I'm trying
[12636.15s -> 12647.00s]  to think. F***ed up what happened. I know I heard the news. It's okay everybody keeps staring at me.
[12647.00s -> 12649.88s]  It's not my fault the power's dead. Yes it is. You did it. This person did it. Whoa
[12650.84s -> 12656.84s]  Miss Parvati. Who's this person here? Hey you're uh what um how are you huh hi hi hello
[12658.12s -> 12663.56s]  are you uh that's the beginning of every one of my streams how you keeping that's how every intro
[12663.56s -> 12669.72s]  starts great just great I've been trying to keep stuff running just like you only I'm not so wait
[12670.44s -> 12677.32s]  they didn't kick you out did they oh gosh no I'm just along with this fella here I've seen you
[12677.32s -> 12685.10s]  wandering around here you don't look like you're coming from town I'm just trying to get my ship
[12685.10s -> 12689.26s]  off the ground never heard it phrased in such a way before I guess we're all trying to get our
[12689.26s -> 12695.11s]  ships off the ground ain't we sorry I just wasn't sure if you were from town or if you were one of
[12695.11s -> 12703.03s]  us something's been chewing at me you see what's wrong fact is I've been well lying to everybody
[12703.03s -> 12708.47s]  here camp thinks I'm a mechanical genius but I couldn't fix a busted chair don't tell them I
[12708.47s -> 12716.47s]  like this okay I like this guy uh never too late to start learning I can give you a couple
[12716.47s -> 12722.31s]  pointers we could both be lying idiot engineers I'll take all the help I can get I set my mind
[12722.31s -> 12727.75s]  to learning the craft of the engineer you see I want to make something of myself you ever heard
[12727.75s -> 12733.27s]  of the young spacer's guide to mechanical engineering comes in a set of three if I had
[12733.27s -> 12738.87s]  my hands on one of those data pads I could teach myself the ins and outs those are good
[12739.67s -> 12744.63s]  my dad kept a copy with him when he was working in the cannery I know the old community center
[12744.63s -> 12750.87s]  kept the copy should find another one back in town if you could find me even one of those pads
[12750.87s -> 12759.75s]  I'd be greatly obliged one give me money too I'll pay you for every pad you bring me
[12760.31s -> 12765.11s]  if by some miracle you can bring me the full set I'll give you something pretty I've been
[12765.11s -> 12772.66s]  saving for a lucky day okay what about the third one I wish I knew I wagered the town
[12772.74s -> 12782.30s]  at the full set once upon a time where the third's gone I can't say would you I'd be grateful but
[12782.30s -> 12795.26s]  wait you oh you're gonna have to go to the town right you're gonna have to go to edge the I don't

[12832.57s -> 12845.00s]  edge water right you're all gonna be an edge water soon oh wait this is I get to just take
[12845.00s -> 12853.93s]  their power that's the thing about growing old your eyes start to fail elsewise I would
[12853.93s -> 12859.45s]  have seen you for the snake that you are chopped you into pieces and roasted you on a spit
[12860.68s -> 12867.48s]  this is all you're doing cutting off my power killing off my garden without refrigeration
[12867.48s -> 12874.86s]  my food will spoil and my flock will starve I want to ask you this in private away from the
[12875.02s -> 12883.90s]  I didn't call myself a snake tell me why did you do it lie give me a lie damn it
[12885.02s -> 12889.88s]  this isn't personal Adelaide I need your power regular I don't know I like pressing buttons I

[12898.65s -> 12905.85s]  gonna say this once go talk to grace and Thomas look them in the eye and tell them their life
[12905.85s -> 12913.37s]  here is over and the only thing left to do is go back to edge water this is now your responsibility
[12914.33s -> 12920.09s]  and you tell Reid Thompson that I will never return to edge water I would rather die among
[12920.09s -> 12926.81s]  my flowers than live under his management different scenario what if I go back and kill
[12926.81s -> 12932.87s]  Reid Thompson and then you I I take over the town and I'll be nice to everybody
[12941.78s -> 12947.94s]  you offering the cross read off huh this some sort of twisted reparation for what you've done
[12947.94s -> 12954.42s]  wait what I can do this looking for a chance to sow some chaos kill Reid if you must what
[12954.42s -> 12960.82s]  talk him into leaving if you can he and I are not sharing the same four hold on am I doing a double
[12960.82s -> 12971.86s]  cross on a double cross kill Reid if you must what happened to you all this anger had to come from
[12972.50s -> 12978.65s]  my son worked in that cannery when the plague started coming he was one of the first to fall
[12978.65s -> 12986.41s]  sick we had a store of medicine locked away but Reid refused to treat him said my boy didn't
[12986.41s -> 12991.13s]  deserve treatment said the medicine would have been wasted on him yeah so we get rid of the bad
[12991.13s -> 12998.46s]  guy we unify everybody and I run the place my belongings and left that's as much of the story
[12998.46s -> 13006.84s]  as you need to hear Reid isn't just gonna all right yeah fine
[13017.64s -> 13035.77s]  from Edgewater okay I think we got a deal okay guys look you know I got good news and bad news
[13035.77s -> 13042.01s]  food's bound to spoil at this rate look the good news is that you have to leave what happened the
[13042.01s -> 13048.81s]  bad news is that I'm gonna kill Reid and I'm gonna be your boss no other way reverse that
[13048.81s -> 13058.44s]  marauders can't see us in the dark wild canids on the other hand uh go back to Edgewater the
[13058.44s -> 13064.73s]  matter's been weighing on me I'm staying put until I know what's become a zoe oh don't even please
[13064.73s -> 13068.81s]  don't want that question haunting me all the way back to the cannery I don't want to do that quest
[13079.02s -> 13086.74s]  really I have to do that who else do we need I need to convince somebody else
[13087.38s -> 13094.23s]  who else do I have to convince I don't know how much longer we'll I don't know how much
[13094.31s -> 13098.39s]  I don't know how much longer we'll keep your wits about you keep your wits about you
[13098.39s -> 13104.79s]  keep your wits about you stop copying each other clearly you heard her say that keep your wits
[13104.79s -> 13109.27s]  about you keep your wits about you keep your wits about you I don't know how much longer
[13109.27s -> 13117.93s]  will last without power thank you any luck finding one of those manuals go back to Edgewater
[13118.49s -> 13124.81s]  I've been thinking about going back I'm not much used to anybody here I get sick thinking about
[13124.81s -> 13130.49s]  working at the cannery I can't do that again don't worry I mentioned those manuals on mechanical
[13130.49s -> 13135.29s]  engineering oh come on suppose if I had one of those I could go back to Reed and make a real case
[13135.29s -> 13159.14s]  for myself all right let's go get Zoe you can't be far right only 340 only 343 feet kill Reed first
[13163.54s -> 13173.80s]  well I need the power regulator kill Reed then kill her
[13178.39s -> 13200.38s]  both they'll go kill come back wow you did it yep uh that's just absolute chaos all right so
[13200.38s -> 13211.00s]  hold on I'm not gonna touch anything I'm gonna go get rid of Reed uh let's go get her to Reed
[13211.72s -> 13224.02s]  fuck I'm a man of my word I'm a man of my word temporarily right so I'm gonna go get rid of
[13224.02s -> 13229.78s]  Reed I'm gonna come back I did that I told you I was gonna do that and I did I also come up with
[13229.78s -> 13249.26s]  new ideas on the fly all the time and second idea is get rid of you too it's temporarily all right so
[13250.22s -> 13258.09s]  Reed now what if I tell Reed about the plan that I'm coming to kill him could I double cross the
[13258.09s -> 13261.61s]  double cross and then double cross her and then come back and just double cross again
[13262.25s -> 13274.42s]  can I just bounce back and forth what's going on oh wait wait wait wait who are these people
[13275.14s -> 13298.28s]  outside this town what just happened why are they on the fucking main road I just got double
[13298.28s -> 13327.08s]  crossed just fast travel fast travel didn't exist 100 years ago so no okay you know it comes
[13327.08s -> 13350.46s]  a time when you have to understand that they're just in here oh cool take the money out of the
[13350.46s -> 13358.84s]  register I you did that I didn't holy shit you're stealing I didn't do it have you been watching me
[13376.92s -> 13378.70s]  I gotta make some armor stuff
[13381.35s -> 13397.29s]  necklace so I can sell this shit too wait I'm going in I'm going in trespassing lockpicking
[13397.29s -> 13401.77s]  hacking and murder are all considered illegal activities avoid being seen if you want to
[13401.77s -> 13415.19s]  engage in these activities this place more rotters tomato juice light ammo salt rifle
[13417.08s -> 13423.75s]  all right well this you got a lot of stuff here I don't think it was worth it though
[13433.10s -> 13448.46s]  okay let's keep going that's all right it'll heal okay all right read
[13454.89s -> 13477.50s]  got it inside voices his head show me his head oh fuck you didn't do anything actually I did it
[13477.50s -> 13491.72s]  you watched it was me I did it okay all right read I'm not even gonna mess around I'm just
[13491.72s -> 13513.99s]  not sure I even talk to him or should I just go in there and just just get him can't talk
[13513.99s -> 13533.45s]  to a dead guy did you get it all right all right all right read we're in that tower
[13534.09s -> 13543.05s]  yeah all right read he keeps saying all right read all right listen read all right read
[13543.93s -> 13562.04s]  but what happens when I do they are they gonna know I killed him what if I kill him and then
[13562.04s -> 13567.48s]  just drop him outside the window so it looks like he fell backwards through the glass and tripped
[13567.48s -> 13579.48s]  and like broke through the glass this is a fine day friend power flows through our town like a
[13579.48s -> 13584.74s]  cool stream of water I trust Adelaide's people have seen their way to reason
[13584.74s -> 13592.92s]  so when can I expect them back at their posts I spoke to Adelaide she won't come back as long
[13592.92s -> 13595.64s]  as you're here I delivered your message but I haven't convinced Adelaide to come back
[13596.84s -> 13611.69s]  let me ask you something go ahead have you taken a look around your town lately it is my job to
[13611.69s -> 13623.13s]  keep two eyes on my town I am the steward of this place and this is my watch post your town's
[13623.13s -> 13631.13s]  fallen apart Rick I wish you wouldn't say things like that you know okay I'm thinking real
[13631.13s -> 13638.14s]  thinking real hard about it I expect you wouldn't understand you don't see the town as I do when I
[13638.14s -> 13644.86s]  stand at my window and look out over my so do it now here's what I see I see decent loyal hard
[13644.86s -> 13651.90s]  working people I see a family we are all part of the spacers choice family we are all doing what
[13651.90s -> 13661.85s]  we were brought into this world to do this is a spacer's choice town we're all part of the
[13661.85s -> 13670.09s]  spacers choice family here the company keeps us warm keeps us fed keeps us working loyalty has
[13670.09s -> 13679.93s]  got nothing to do with it this is good old-fashioned gratitude how long have you worked here for I'm
[13679.93s -> 13687.61s]  trying to remember 25 years 26 when you get to my age the years just rush by you stop counting
[13687.61s -> 13693.93s]  all together I remember looking out this window and seeing the veil spread out from horizon to
[13693.93s -> 13707.10s]  horizon we were a sprawling town people change but the veil will always be here spacers choice
[13707.10s -> 13734.73s]  will always be here our work won't ever end I take comfort in that how do I kill them without
[13735.45s -> 13746.38s]  you guys knowing you some sort of freelancer what was your last break I appreciate what you've done
[13746.38s -> 13756.63s]  for us I spoke to Adelaide she won't be coming back as long as you are here then we are at an
[13756.63s -> 13763.64s]  impasse stewardship over this town has been entrusted to me by spacers choice I am not perfect
[13763.64s -> 13774.31s]  I have made my share of mistakes but I have done my best for this town the town's terrified of
[13774.31s -> 13782.86s]  plague everybody asked me to steal medicine for him you let Adelaide's son die her son got sick
[13782.86s -> 13787.66s]  with plague a couple years back company never gave us enough medication to treat the whole town
[13788.70s -> 13796.60s]  so I had to choose you see Adelaide's child or someone else's she's never forgiven me I don't
[13796.60s -> 13802.12s]  expect she ever will shit shit shit oh no no no no we're getting we're getting bad guy exposition
[13802.12s -> 13815.88s]  actually is not bad guy make you make wire maybe it's time for you step down I'm a spacers choice
[13815.88s -> 13821.64s]  man my father was a spacers choice man Edgewater may not look like much to some buttoned up
[13821.64s -> 13833.45s]  freelancer but it is my home and you made fun of me attack well I tried what do I say that attack
[13838.26s -> 13855.50s]  why do you think about this I gotta think about this what a great time to learn about companion

[13946.65s -> 13952.57s]  natural causes or through early retirement passed on somebody else you most importantly
[13952.57s -> 13958.41s]  it is imperative that you keep the spacers choice family together Adelaide McDevitt and
[13958.41s -> 13962.09s]  her followers have taken camp in the old botanical lab their place is here working with us
[13963.51s -> 13971.54s]  Adelaide is impervious to reason and refuses to entertain diplomatic overtures the only way to
[13971.54s -> 13974.82s]  introduce her and come back is by heading the plant cutting of power and leading her people
[13974.82s -> 13982.17s]  back to Edgewater with the power shut off the can like really okay I'm corporate your request
[13982.17s -> 13987.53s]  for additional building materials has been denied the walls around Edgewater were built 30 years
[13987.53s -> 13991.69s]  ago by my predecessor sir any authorations expansions repairs to this wall must be signed
[13991.69s -> 13996.89s]  and approved by your predecessor if you pray if your predecessor is your responsibility to obtain
[13996.89s -> 14005.43s]  the last will and testament demonstrating your predecessor's intentions so wait is she gone

[14127.22s -> 14138.23s]  cheating I I said what I said I said get lost because yeah and I think that's cheating in a
[14138.23s -> 14145.82s]  game that way you have choices that you have to make I feel like reverting on one of those choices
[14145.82s -> 14153.69s]  is kind of going against the nature of the game that's the only likable character in the game
[14156.68s -> 14195.64s]  is that true that can't be true all right I've delivered reads message so what do I want to do
[14195.64s -> 14212.14s]  now let's see if I can find Zoe find three volumes companion max says the journal was
[14212.14s -> 14227.27s]  wait a minute hold on companion that guy's a companion oh shit hey well we get a new friend

[14278.55s -> 14310.31s]  haven't decided what I'm gonna do I'm contemplating give me a rock for cover how do I know when they're
[14310.31s -> 14328.31s]  all dead I wish I had my companion that says that's the last of them she'll be back she'll be back
[14328.95s -> 14350.50s]  all right here we go all right time for a new guy we're gonna have a new companion
[14351.38s -> 14363.13s]  are you ready we're gonna get the priest he probably has magic powers I just got the
[14363.13s -> 14367.85s]  letter today corporate ordered me to relocate to the edgewater cannery effective immediately
[14368.73s -> 14372.17s]  it's a shame I was really looking forward to running my own gift shop at the community
[14372.17s -> 14377.37s]  center selling rare memorabilia but scripture tells us that all things happen for a reason
[14377.37s -> 14382.01s]  work fortifies the spirit and all as for my book collection I can't bear to part with it
[14382.01s -> 14389.05s]  don't want those books malding in some contraband lunker like chat currently is over the loss
[14389.05s -> 14392.73s]  of their favorite character who they deem to be the only likable person in the game
[14393.77s -> 14398.25s]  but I find that to be an untrue statement so I stashed them all the way in a cave by the river
[14398.25s -> 14408.14s]  no I didn't do that to chat members I stashed the books I died through them all in a river
[14408.78s -> 14415.62s]  retrieve the journal let's go read these messages
[14417.34s -> 14423.18s]  da da da da da you think the corporation's yet that the da from eldritch a that the da case
[14423.18s -> 14435.18s]  screenshot it read it later to be honest it's rare to see a playthrough that doesn't have
[14435.18s -> 14458.39s]  priority we're on rare playthrough now guys you are encumbered oh no of course I am all right
[14458.39s -> 14468.18s]  let's eat a bunch of food just eat the bag of bread okay where's my uh list here 83 to 80
[14468.74s -> 14479.59s]  eat some canned tuna I have a um bring some drink just drink uh what else do I have break
[14479.59s -> 14514.49s]  some stuff down I got like five trip blades 142 130 this is shocked though tactical shotgun and
[14514.49s -> 14529.03s]  what am I what I have this on this is a long gun yeah light machine gun it's a long gun
[14529.03s -> 14533.43s]  no it's heavy weapons but I still it's not bad okay whatever oh hunting rifle
[14533.43s -> 14554.15s]  look at that long gun yep cool nice all right let's go how many viewers did he lose by not
[14554.15s -> 14584.12s]  resetting uh I don't know oh how many viewers did he lose I can't believe he told the party
[14584.12s -> 14591.51s]  to get out of here I that's a shiny in purple I thought it was I don't know something to look at
[14592.39s -> 14606.39s]  I just got killed by an insect bug repeller zap thing oh shit let's get it open journal
[14609.13s -> 14612.33s]  all right new companion see that was even who cares nothing's wrong
[14614.74s -> 14640.04s]  not everybody has to have the same companion we're gonna get we're gonna get this guy just
[14640.04s -> 14644.71s]  wait until he does his first magic spell and I think everyone's gonna have their minds changed
[14645.43s -> 14673.56s]  this guy's gonna cast fireballs and shit and you guys are oh this guy is awesome actually he's
[14673.56s -> 14682.81s]  gonna be cast in fireballs ice bolts shadow bolts isn't magic in this game if you come to ask
[14682.81s -> 14688.41s]  forgiveness for Reid Thompson's murder I'm afraid OSI theology has little to say on the matter what
[14688.41s -> 14698.79s]  does everybody know I killed him what are you talking about murderer I didn't do anything I was
[14698.79s -> 14705.35s]  told it was a stranger come to town I see no other strangers about but the workers of Edgewater may
[14705.35s -> 14710.63s]  not be the most reliable witnesses of course how dare you you know what how dare you accuse me of
[14710.63s -> 14717.46s]  something like that I should leave I should just leave I mean I got your book but I should get out
[14717.46s -> 14725.83s]  of here this is fantastic well worth all the sacrifices I wait what the fuck is this
[14727.43s -> 14734.47s]  French I can't fucking read French it's a law-forsaken joke is what it is French
[14735.99s -> 14740.95s]  I was so high and mighty preaching to the yokels about following the plan
[14741.03s -> 14747.43s]  while fighting it at every turn you guys said this guy sucks be sure he's fucking nuts
[14751.77s -> 14759.05s]  you're overreacting a bit don't you think over overreacting do you have any idea how many years I
[14759.05s -> 14767.61s]  spent in no you couldn't possibly know could you I've spent my life searching for the keys to
[14767.61s -> 14773.13s]  unlocking the secrets of the universal equation that underlies the plan I had hoped this book
[14773.37s -> 14779.61s]  some of those answers I became so desperate I even got myself assigned to this plague-ridden
[14779.61s -> 14787.21s]  water to find the damn thing all the time and suffering I've spent liar love liars
[14789.54s -> 14794.58s]  both I mean is he is he a med is he are you into medicine I think I'm gonna get along just fine
[14797.05s -> 14800.49s]  at least still have your mission work here to give you a meaningful purpose why did you think the
[14800.49s -> 14806.84s]  book held the secrets you're looking for this has to be some kind of cosmic retribution what
[14807.08s -> 14811.96s]  are you going to see the author had some interesting theories about man's perception
[14811.96s -> 14815.72s]  of reality that I thought could be applied to our attempts to decipher the plan
[14816.76s -> 14822.52s]  unfortunately he was also one of the founders of the philosopher's school of thought so the book
[14822.52s -> 14836.47s]  is banned in this colony a vicar searching for a banned book that's a bad example the story of my
[14836.47s -> 14842.47s]  life most lay people are not aware of this but we've not discovered any new insights into the
[14842.47s -> 14850.04s]  plan for a long long time I had an idea that we should welcome the truth no matter where we
[14850.04s -> 14856.68s]  found it I had the worst idea to share my thoughts with the superior and that's how I ended up
[14856.68s -> 14861.88s]  assigned prison duty so if everybody knows I killed the bear an inmate bend my ear with stories of
[14861.88s -> 14871.86s]  an original bukonu journal why wouldn't they arrest me what is that philosophism's a false
[14871.86s -> 14877.86s]  religion that stands in contradiction to almost everything we know to be true they believe all is
[14877.86s -> 14883.06s]  chaos in stark contrast to osi's belief in the plan where's their place but most of the
[14883.06s -> 14888.82s]  philosophist perversion of bukonu's thoughts came more than a century after his death but that's
[14888.82s -> 14894.50s]  neither here nor there what I need to do now is to find a translator obviously but to do that
[14894.50s -> 14900.10s]  I'll first need to secure transport I got you you have a ship perhaps I could make myself of
[14900.10s -> 14909.26s]  use to your crew I think so you need to ride out of town I wouldn't mind a ship hand certainly
[14909.82s -> 14914.94s]  I already gave you most of my money but I can offer you free spiritual counseling and I'd be
[14914.94s -> 14920.30s]  happy to watch your back okay that sounds like a great idea toss ball stick or any blunt instrument
[14920.30s -> 14926.78s]  really I'm also a passable gun hand if it comes to that I can usually talk my way out of conflict
[14926.78s -> 14931.74s]  though yep that's this oh this is my I'm fairly competent at hacking computers as well and he's
[14931.74s -> 14942.98s]  a computer hacker is that all part of your training let's go fantastic let me get my things in order
[14942.98s -> 14948.98s]  and I'll catch up with you I shall see you on the ship captain whenever you're ready to leave emerald
[14948.98s -> 14962.63s]  veil nice nice all right we got a new companion all right now let's return to we have to do Zoe
[14962.63s -> 14989.56s]  right find Zoe actually not that far away where are you max is my best friend Zoe's wait I can
[14989.56s -> 15000.09s]  come back to this guy I have the thing for you hi Ludwig never seen the veil lit up like this before
[15001.34s -> 15007.82s]  you mentioned a logic module I found one bang up work soldier you're a credit to your uniform
[15008.46s -> 15017.19s]  oh that reminds me got a look into getting us a uniform so this is it then the key to humanity's
[15017.19s -> 15023.45s]  victory over the mechanical hordes I would reward you with the gratitude of the resistance but
[15024.01s -> 15030.33s]  I'm guessing you want something tactile so here's a couple bits for your trouble and a little
[15030.33s -> 15042.84s]  something to remember me by and a shock stick oh cool thanks I'm kidding let me see what that is
[15045.70s -> 15056.87s]  one-handed cool shock stick I'll put it on in place of this let's check it out
[15062.30s -> 15080.47s]  loud weapon cool all right it's always far away damn now put that into the trash why would I do
[15080.47s -> 15117.08s]  that fast travel fast travel fast travel is this the entire map um no probably not it's probably
[15117.08s -> 15133.05s]  different areas it's different planets it's not the entire game this guys this game is like two
[15133.05s -> 15138.97s]  to three hundred hours long just to do these story missions if you did them as fast as possible
[15138.97s -> 15155.80s]  the whole game takes about 700 hours to complete all right let's scout it out
[15156.52s -> 15171.13s]  I knew that was gonna happen it's okay eat something I'm gonna be encumbered again aren't I
[15174.49s -> 15196.86s]  speedrun stream nah nah this thing's fucking amazing all right I'm only gonna use sniper rifle
[15196.86s -> 15237.93s]  though oh that's a lot of people what's going on did I get a dog friend it's going in where did it
[15237.93s -> 15253.19s]  go did I think I just heard it die no oh no that's their dog okay let's I gotta be accurate
[15253.19s -> 15320.76s]  that's gonna kill me isn't it oh shit they're after me oh fuck what's that that's why they ran away
[15328.42s -> 15355.80s]  okay new plan we're gonna stealth into this room this way around the back I just have to go in
[15355.80s -> 15375.94s]  there and talk to Zoe you see anybody why don't I have a button that I can press in every action
[15375.94s -> 15383.96s]  game ever made after 2014 to go and see everything through the walls to see every interactable object
[15383.96s -> 15403.86s]  and see all people in all things that I can activate every five seconds the fuck they the
[15403.94s -> 15417.27s]  fuck is going on he tripped on his own mind why does that detect me doesn't that make no sense
[15436.01s -> 15440.25s]  all right well let's try this again this time I hope they don't trip their own minds
[15441.13s -> 15504.17s]  I'm gonna go this way don't do it where's this dog oh no I'm fine nobody got alerted all right
[15504.81s -> 15538.70s]  I hear running all right Zoe Zoe Zoe get me out of here get me out get me out
[15541.02s -> 15563.24s]  watch out for the lava watch out for the lava what do you mean I need proof
[15563.24s -> 15569.32s]  find proof on Zoe's corpse you found Zoe then promptly killed her you could probably tell
[15569.32s -> 15572.92s]  grace you found her that way but you should probably see if you can find anything on Zoe's
[15572.92s -> 15582.65s]  corpse that grace might recognize oh come on what now I have to sneak back in
[15584.38s -> 15587.50s]  I have to sneak back in the compound to take something
[15590.71s -> 15608.23s]  okay hold on I have new perks and new skills I need to do hold on let's get some more medical
[15609.11s -> 15616.14s]  20 20 medical is a I can do make a mixed rugs together and take them I don't know
[15617.54s -> 15623.30s]  dialogue let's get dialogue to 40 so now scramble duration is plus seven seconds
[15623.30s -> 15629.83s]  terrifies error effect is 100 and let's go back into ranged oh wait a minute yeah I want 50 for
[15629.83s -> 15650.63s]  long guns too that works hurts all right how about uh how about stealth detection that one's not bad

[15894.79s -> 15919.78s]  here you go wait how much is this worth no price I'm not in the lightest of humors right now
[15922.15s -> 15935.91s]  uh Zoe's not coming back you want to expand on that yes she went feral I had to put her down
[15936.55s -> 15940.22s]  I was hoping you wouldn't say that I was really hoping
[15941.34s -> 15950.49s]  you'd better not be spinning me a story I could bring back her body if you want might have to make
[15950.49s -> 15957.85s]  a few trips Jesus yeah that belonged to her well enough guess there's no arguing with you
[15958.73s -> 15966.17s]  you pretty much did my job for me least I could do is pay you for your trouble let me know if I
[15966.17s -> 15973.05s]  can do something for you I got money for that too thanks yes uh there is something you can do
[15973.05s -> 15980.20s]  I'm not in the lightest of humors right now it's time for you to go home all right uh I gotta find
[15980.20s -> 15992.95s]  this guy's book but but but but unfortunately it's time to turn the stream off if you weren't here
[15992.95s -> 15999.91s]  earlier uh I'm shaving some time off of the streams this week to prepare for a couple things
[15999.91s -> 16004.95s]  Thanksgiving is going to be moved around a little bit because I'm streaming on Thanksgiving and I
[16004.95s -> 16013.19s]  have an upper endoscopy this week too so I need to I have to like go on a little bit of a changed
[16013.19s -> 16021.72s]  diet and I have some procedure shit to do so this week is a little busy I'm going to stream the next
[16021.72s -> 16026.92s]  three days in Rome streaming on Thanksgiving too but the streams are going to be like four to five
[16026.92s -> 16041.53s]  hours each so we're going to play I feel like I'm just getting into it now I've had an upper
[16041.53s -> 16046.97s]  endoscopy it's kind of neat well I had a colonoscopy a few months ago and we're going the other way
[16046.97s -> 16056.47s]  this time uh but so that's going to be the end here we're going to transition out to the bits
[16056.47s -> 16059.99s]  and everything see you tomorrow we're going to do the same thing to pick up right where you left
[16059.99s -> 16065.18s]  off right here I feel like I'm like I said I'm just getting barely into it now so bear with me
[16065.18s -> 16073.66s]  this week well um obviously holiday stuff and uh a medical procedure have to take some precedence so
[16074.46s -> 16081.61s]  streams will be shaved but I'll see you guys tomorrow I'm going to actually do a hard save
[16081.61s -> 16090.02s]  here because I have not done it once the whole game so that would be nice uh first impression so
[16090.02s -> 16102.78s]  far feels like feels like there's I this might I don't I don't know if this is a it might just
[16102.78s -> 16110.54s]  be talking complete bullshit here in the first few hours of the game but there it seems like
[16110.54s -> 16118.26s]  there there are I thought there weren't going to be that many interesting choices but seems like
[16118.26s -> 16126.39s]  there are I didn't mean killing the guy like that's something you can do seems like there's
[16126.39s -> 16130.79s]  a couple of optional things you can do for each major mission which is kind of interesting I guess
[16132.76s -> 16141.24s]  it does feel like it may have maybe if they had like an extra year or two it'd be expanded on but
[16141.24s -> 16152.65s]  I don't know yet I don't know we'll see but I am an inch I'm interested enough to play it again
[16152.65s -> 16167.16s]  tomorrow it's more limited than I was hoping for it just more fallout type choices yeah I'm like
[16167.16s -> 16171.24s]  it's kind of hard to pass judgment on a game like this in the first three or four hours
[16171.96s -> 16178.12s]  so a couple of interesting things just happened so well all right that's pretty fucking cool some
[16178.12s -> 16182.36s]  interesting developments you can kill this person you can kill that person you can do their mission
[16182.36s -> 16191.77s]  you can cut off the power you I mean that's cool but we'll see if it continues but I cannot
[16191.77s -> 16198.54s]  pass judgment on it yet I feel like it's too early but uh there you go that's kind of what I think
[16201.53s -> 16206.30s]  we'll see how I feel tomorrow I'll see you tomorrow let's transition to the bits
[16207.18s -> 16220.22s]  thanks for joining me everybody see you tomorrow have a great night same time same place you don't
[16220.22s -> 16224.54s]  play games you're just too terrible for it to count as playing I beat the last boss the last
[16224.54s -> 16231.06s]  true boss in Sekiro in under 100 tries just I mean I'm just gonna throw that out there
[16231.62s -> 16245.66s]  have you done that yet did you do that yet have you done that just I just need to know I actually
[16245.66s -> 16248.22s]  did that I mean yeah I'm not I'm not I'm talking to the one guy
[16255.16s -> 16267.67s]  under 100 omega lull I'll see you tomorrow uh let's do the bits let me quit out of here so
[16267.67s -> 16279.00s]  I can pull this over one omega I don't know why I go mega lull I just I think it's so funny
[16280.01s -> 16286.65s]  I love that emo because it's such it could it could be used legitimately or as a total
[16286.65s -> 16302.07s]  overreaction to anything it's great it has so many uses why is it funnier than lul I just
[16303.35s -> 16306.47s]  it's because it's supposed to there's a lot there's a lot of layers there
[16312.38s -> 16317.58s]  but anyways uh let's do the let's get the music rolling here thanks again for joining me thank
[16317.58s -> 16324.94s]  you sad vega for the 250 I thought we were calling the 2019 germa uh awards the germies
[16325.90s -> 16345.78s]  that's loud I'll turn it down uh the germies huh maybe I look forward to it though it's like I
[16345.78s -> 16354.17s]  I can't wait to see what the nominations could be it's it's just fun I can't wait
[16356.63s -> 16361.59s]  but that's not yet that's gonna happen second half obviously of December so we have a lot of
[16361.59s -> 16368.84s]  other things to think about first hey spunky spade thanks for the thousand bits if I give you
[16368.92s -> 16372.36s]  my bits will you leave my rats alone I have nothing to do with your rats
[16373.69s -> 16377.13s]  I'll take the thousand bits but I have nothing to do with those rats I didn't do anything to your
[16377.13s -> 16382.90s]  rats yes I will leave your rats alone because from the very beginning I was not I was leaving them
[16382.90s -> 16387.51s]  alone in the first place so you got your wish thanks for the thousand bits appreciate it
[16387.51s -> 16406.14s]  seriously uh wait does this work I say this every stream let's see if it worked it's always like
[16406.22s -> 16415.74s]  four streams behind I don't know why it doesn't make any sense doesn't work
[16419.94s -> 16422.90s]  thank you uh lights not on thanks to the 250
[16424.38s -> 16430.94s]  germa just a month ago I lost my iphone se and I heard your se ran at the end of the dead rising
[16430.94s -> 16437.42s]  stream rip both our se's I guess this tears in memory of them oh and it's lights not on
[16438.30s -> 16445.43s]  got it I got it I wish I could get a fucking as a brand new se sealed with no tracking device
[16445.43s -> 16460.15s]  bug on it it'd be amazing I wanted an se so bad and let's do the credits camera's not on right
[16460.15s -> 16472.41s]  in case it is it's not thank you all the subs welcome back to all of the long time subs and
[16472.41s -> 16483.14s]  welcome for the first time welcome for the first time all the new ones thanks something that needs
[16483.14s -> 16489.62s]  to be said about the Minecraft king stream this is very important and it's a decision that I did
[16489.62s -> 16497.40s]  not make lightly actually this is really really important kill the music for a second I don't
[16497.40s -> 16501.88s]  think I talked too much about this but of all the things that we talked about at the beginning of
[16501.88s -> 16508.28s]  the stream the thing that is absolutely number one for like true the for everything is set in
[16508.28s -> 16514.52s]  stone it's going to be a sub-only server with potential twitch integration like you need to
[16514.52s -> 16523.22s]  verify your twitch id and you have to be more than one month sub and the reason why we're
[16523.22s -> 16536.17s]  doing that is because Minecraft is probably the easiest video game on earth to fucking script
[16536.17s -> 16547.38s]  and destroy like a whole stream so it has to be that way we're it's going to be a multi-month sub
[16547.38s -> 16554.79s]  only and the reason why it has to be multi-month is because if it was just sub only somebody could
[16554.79s -> 16563.90s]  just sub and then come in and that's you know hey five dollars here you go take it I'm coming in
[16566.89s -> 16573.21s]  so just need to be we're going to try to protect the server in quotes I guess as best as we can
[16574.52s -> 16580.68s]  so that's the way that is absolutely set in stone but when there's still some bits to do
[16582.90s -> 16592.30s]  we have uh sad vega thanks for the 250 this is the best dumb rp playthrough I've ever seen
[16592.30s -> 16599.82s]  you really nailed the role of being an idiot down to full chat my character is not even stupid
[16599.82s -> 16607.85s]  though he's an engineer he's a medic he's a scientist and he's a liar you have to be smart
[16607.85s -> 16618.62s]  to lie well Freudian weapon thanks for the 250 no that's not that's not 250 it's 250 times
[16618.62s -> 16626.98s]  one two three four five thanks for the thousand bits Freudian uh appreciate the 10 bucks though
[16626.98s -> 16630.82s]  some choices you made may have infuriated me watching you play this was thoroughly entertaining
[16631.54s -> 16637.56s]  happy thanksgiving and good luck with the endoscopy I appreciate that thank you
[16639.42s -> 16648.89s]  the endoscopy is at the end of this week but for a few days before I infuriated for a few days before
[16648.89s -> 16655.45s]  the procedure I have to I can't eat certain foods and I have to kind of the day before
[16655.45s -> 16659.93s]  I can't eat anything well the night before whatever so I'm going to be all kind of trying
[16659.93s -> 16666.22s]  to change the way that I eat stuff and then obviously I'm going to be on drugs for the
[16666.22s -> 16674.36s]  procedures so I'm going to be kind of all over the place so that's uh it's all good though
[16676.34s -> 16682.28s]  only eat nuts and fruits uh oh you mean only nuts and fruits well from my understanding it's
[16682.28s -> 16691.32s]  anything that has skin on it no corn no peas no nuts no um fruits especially like berries
[16691.96s -> 16702.15s]  I just have to be careful no beans anytime I have a procedure like this I always kind of get a
[16702.15s -> 16708.55s]  little paranoid that I'm going to do something wrong I also don't I can't take any anti-inflammatory
[16708.55s -> 16713.43s]  medication like I can't take any uh like advil or something or aspirin I don't think just be
[16713.43s -> 16724.55s]  careful and it's the same the first time I've had to do something like this so it's not like
[16724.55s -> 16728.87s]  I'm nervous about it but you know anytime that you have anything like this going on you
[16729.91s -> 16735.11s]  anytime where I'm going to lie on a table and I'm going to get put unconscious and someone's going
[16735.11s -> 16742.94s]  to like do like things you know like medical I just get kind of like not nervous but obviously
[16742.94s -> 16749.18s]  it's understandable like I have to get put under so it's like I have to go under anesthesia and
[16749.18s -> 16756.30s]  have like a doctor fucking do like a scope so it just kind of creeps me out in a way you know
[16765.72s -> 16776.06s]  no that's the wrong music I'll see you tomorrow I feel the same I have arthritis and I've been
[16776.06s -> 16785.29s]  too been too tuned been too many times from my age yeah I just don't I don't like the anesthesia
[16785.29s -> 16792.36s]  drugs I just don't there's something about them just there's this chemical that they can put into
[16792.36s -> 16803.98s]  you that turns you off and then turns you back on it's uh this is it's just uh rubs me the wrong
[16803.98s -> 16820.58s]  way but you know you gotta do what you gotta do it was a huge medical breakthrough yeah it I mean
[16820.58s -> 16827.70s]  it absolutely is one of the most unbelievable discoveries of modern history is being able to
[16828.42s -> 16833.86s]  be able to go inside people and fix stuff without them even knowing you know other than
[16833.86s -> 16839.62s]  you knowing and obviously they know they're there but being that that I don't who the how the fuck
[16839.62s -> 16850.02s]  do you even come up with that how who what's the what's the process there to even figure that out
[16852.79s -> 16857.91s]  such remarkable medical and technological advances how did we come up with this shit
[16857.91s -> 16871.77s]  they used to just use alcohol yeah remarkable but that's my time guys sorry again for these
[16871.77s -> 16884.06s]  shorter streams uh this week but I have to go uh help prep for Thanksgiving and other stuff
[16886.30s -> 16895.86s]  don't read don't read that negative comment don't read it jerma you only read the negative
[16895.86s -> 16902.06s]  comments don't read it out loud don't read it you suck jerma fuck I shouldn't have read that
