[1.91s -> 20.74s]  What's happening? What's up? Somebody said, what's cocaine like? Will you relax? First thing that
[20.74s -> 26.01s]  you're going to say in this chat. First thing you're going to ask me in 2023. That's your first
[26.01s -> 36.17s]  comment of the whole year. Oh my god. No, what's up? How's everybody doing? Welcome to the first
[36.17s -> 45.46s]  stream of first. There's a lot of first time chatters. What's going on here? It's, it's like
[45.54s -> 54.41s]  only first time chatters. What? Have I just not paid attention to any of this? Does this happen
[54.41s -> 66.47s]  all the time? There's a lot of these. It's because it's EU friendly. Oh, it's an EU friendly stream.
[67.88s -> 79.58s]  It is noon pacific. You're right. Well, happy new year. I mean, it's not that early. A lot of my
[79.58s -> 85.42s]  streams start only a couple hours from now. I wouldn't say this is super EU friendly.
[86.14s -> 92.26s]  But whatever, I'm doing the thing where I'm very clearly leaning back and my chin is going down
[93.06s -> 97.08s]  because I have to burp, but I'm still talking. You're still fucking hearing my sentence,
[97.08s -> 104.31s]  by the way. I'm not going to stop and burp and I'm not done talking yet. I'm good now.
[105.03s -> 112.34s]  How long is this stream going to be? I don't know. I'll tell you what we're doing though.
[112.90s -> 127.21s]  It's a little game called Wrestling Empire. I do admit I have getting the itch to come back
[127.21s -> 138.01s]  to this game. The last time we played it was six months ago, five months ago. I saw a lot of what
[138.01s -> 145.70s]  Moon Moon was doing and it just made the itch just unscratchable. So I had to play it. So
[145.70s -> 162.44s]  Wrestling Empire is the first stream of the new year. It's itchy. And I will tell you,
[164.33s -> 167.13s]  how many goblins approximately do you think you could take in a single time?
[168.09s -> 178.02s]  Um, a lot. I actually think a lot. How big are they? I'm thinking 10. Do I have a weapon?
[178.66s -> 191.88s]  10. Is it just fist? Is it just fist versus fist? I don't know. I forget who even said that,
[191.88s -> 201.93s]  but is it, do I get a weapon or is it just like I can punch? It's my grandma's birthday,
[201.93s -> 209.06s]  play Elden Ring. No, I'm not playing Elden Ring until later. Stop stalling. It's the first,
[209.14s -> 217.75s]  it's been four minutes. Just relax for a second. Four minutes is not a stall. That is one to two
[217.75s -> 223.67s]  minutes for the intro. And I've been talking for less than two minutes. This is a stall would be
[223.67s -> 232.46s]  15 minutes. Stall is 15 minutes, not four. I've only been speaking for two minutes. This is a
[232.46s -> 240.49s]  normal length for an introduction to a broadcast. Very normal. But I think I would beat up, I could
[240.49s -> 251.72s]  beat up 10 goblins without a doubt. Honestly, it might even be 20. If there's no weapons involved,
[251.72s -> 266.87s]  I think I'm all right. So, uh, something, so Holly and I last night were making characters in this
[266.87s -> 273.32s]  game. I was like, you know what, maybe I will play it. Yeah. It sounds like fun. I made a bunch of
[273.32s -> 280.57s]  people. Holly and I, we kind of just took turns making characters. I think it was like 12, 13,
[280.57s -> 286.01s]  14 characters we put in the same league. I don't even know who to play with. I have no idea.
[288.07s -> 291.51s]  I just, in fact, I, I don't think I'm going to make a character right now.
[292.07s -> 306.65s]  We'll have to see. Goblin has a battleaxe. That's easy. Stop stalling. I'm, this is not a stick.
[306.65s -> 321.43s]  Get out of here with this. Goblins have claws and I've got, I don't know, choke them. What? Well,
[321.43s -> 331.75s]  oh no. Claws. What do we think I have? It doesn't make any sense. I have, hey, I, what,
[331.75s -> 336.15s]  you don't think I have claws too? You don't think, all right, we're moving on from this.
[336.15s -> 341.32s]  Welcome back. Uh, happy new year again, everybody. Hope your 2023 goes well.
[342.20s -> 350.98s]  No, I would just, I, I'm, I could do it. I don't have to prove this. I'm already proving something
[350.98s -> 357.72s]  later this year. All right. Wrestling empire. You guys ready? Everyone's just ready. We don't
[357.72s -> 365.80s]  have to sit around. It's ready to go. So the question here, all right, let's go over some of
[365.80s -> 375.08s]  the characters. So here's who I've made. Again, Holly and I sat down. This is Sebastian Seles.
[375.64s -> 379.48s]  I just picked wrestling revolution because that was the, I think the most characters are here.
[380.44s -> 388.97s]  So we've got Sebastian Seles runs the operation. I made scorned. I don't know if that was like
[388.97s -> 396.57s]  funny, I guess. Here's the Android, which I thought, I think the Android looks kind of cool.
[398.33s -> 408.74s]  Here's Waltie. Waltie. I didn't make Scally. I think I just added the Y because I just saw
[408.74s -> 423.21s]  that before making the characters. Here's Phil. Phil. Here's Wicked Wilma. Uh, Lionel of the
[423.21s -> 441.03s]  Mountain. Q-Jean. Handsome. What else is here? Oh, scratch. The gnat. I think it's already on the
[441.03s -> 454.66s]  gnat, by the way. Uh, Amphibia Adam. Who else? Oh, Gil. And I think that's it. Who should I,
[454.66s -> 458.52s]  who do I play with? I don't even, I don't know who to play with. I don't know what to do right
[458.52s -> 468.14s]  now. This would be what the third or fourth run through of this game. Make another character. You
[468.14s -> 480.97s]  want me to make another character? I think I want to play with, no, should I play with the gnat and
[480.97s -> 491.85s]  just, who cares? Make another, all right. All right, fine. Who do I make? I feel like I put all
[491.85s -> 498.30s]  of my, my, my, my happiness is in some of these, right? But first of all, hold on. You can't even
[498.30s -> 507.21s]  see me. All right. You want to make a new character? All right. Who should I make? Make sure I'm in the
[507.21s -> 513.40s]  editor. Hi, by the way. Good to see you. All right. How about, uh, this will be only four weeks left
[513.40s -> 529.53s]  here though. All right. Okay. All right. All right. 16 weeks. Make you. No, I made, I already made me
[529.53s -> 535.37s]  before and I don't want to make me. All right. How about Scally? No, we'll keep in Scally. All right.
[535.37s -> 547.94s]  Woodrow. I need to change this. Uh, I don't want you to have a partner. So who do I make? You guys
[547.94s -> 562.79s]  didn't like any of those 12 characters. Now he's stalling. That person gets it. Make Miku. You want
[562.79s -> 569.99s]  to make Miku? No, these are all original characters. These are all original characters. I, I, I, no,
[569.99s -> 576.58s]  no, we're not, we're not, no, not yet. We'll do that later. No, you know what? I'm getting started
[576.58s -> 581.14s]  on the Nat. I don't even care. I'm just playing as the Nat. I'm playing as the Nat. We're starting
[581.14s -> 587.50s]  with the Nat. I, I made all these characters. I made all these. I'm going to relax because I don't
[587.50s -> 594.54s]  want to get angry. It's the new year. Polly and I made all these characters last night. Let's go.
[594.54s -> 600.60s]  I'm going Nat. What do you mean too late? All right. It's already on the Nat. I promised that
[600.60s -> 606.12s]  wasn't picked previously. I did, I was, I didn't mean to pick that. I didn't want to pick the Nat,
[606.12s -> 610.23s]  but the Nat was there already. People are going to think I like did it on purpose.
[611.29s -> 615.61s]  All right. So let's go. For those of you that have no idea what this game is, you're balding.
[615.61s -> 621.77s]  Yeah, I'm almost 40. Good. I can't wait. Um, what was I saying? All right. So you, of course,
[621.77s -> 627.43s]  you know how this game works. You've seen it like five times now. Let's go. You never should have
[627.43s -> 633.03s]  taken the step of the Nat. You don't have what it takes to survive in the real world. I didn't make
[633.03s -> 637.61s]  this person. If you want to be escorted to the ring safely, just admit you made a mistake and back
[637.61s -> 648.41s]  out. This is literally the first time I've ever been here. I see you decided to take responsibility
[648.41s -> 655.08s]  for what happens behind the scenes, the Nat. What's wrong with this guy? If you take this road,
[655.08s -> 658.68s]  it's your responsibility to get through the curtain in time. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It turns green. You
[658.68s -> 668.17s]  have to get through the curtain. Yep. This guy, why is this guy so fucked up? This character, yeah,
[668.17s -> 676.23s]  it's like four, five or four, six. Okay. Yeah. We know how this works. The first match is singles
[676.23s -> 690.71s]  match. Wait, does this character suck? This character might actually be awful. All right.
[690.71s -> 706.92s]  Will you stop explaining? Dude, go sit down. I missed. Should I just hurt him? All right.
[706.92s -> 713.50s]  Fuck this guy about it. Wait, it's not time for my match. When's my match? Look at how hurt this guy
[713.50s -> 735.21s]  is. This guy's like helping me. Shit, I forgot you could do that. What do they want? What do you want?
[737.90s -> 751.27s]  Power slam? What is that? A magazine? Give me that. Can I take it? Give me that back or I'll show you
[751.27s -> 772.41s]  what it's for. What? I'm already fucking everything up. What is this? Is this a menu at a restaurant
[772.41s -> 786.54s]  or is this a magazine? Oh shit. Okay. Here we go. Light reading. That's not my time yet. Don't let
[786.54s -> 790.38s]  anybody scare you out of taking this route. They're at risk, but it can also be more fulfilling. Oh my
[790.38s -> 805.34s]  God, that's Lionel of the Mountain friend. Got it back. Oh wait, this is this lady's magazine.
[806.06s -> 815.64s]  All right, here you can have it back. Right in the nose. What is this? Oh, that's right. They added
[815.64s -> 822.81s]  new items. Like you can dig. That's right. They added, I remember reading the patch notes.
[823.37s -> 833.46s]  I got to get back inside. Find a treasure. There's a treasure? There's also a presence too,
[833.46s -> 843.62s]  which you can open, I think. Yeah. Oh my God, there's just $300 on the ground. Stop. This shovel is
[843.62s -> 854.18s]  mine now, Nat. Just assume everything you own is mine. Why is this guy such a dick? God damn it.
[854.18s -> 864.73s]  Right before fucking match two. Help. Somebody help me. Why am I getting Rube Goldberg wrestled?
[866.68s -> 888.31s]  Oh my God. This is bad. All right, let's go. This microphone. Oh my God. This is just look
[888.31s -> 895.27s]  at how big this microphone is. This microphone is huge. It's not supposed to be like this. Look at
[895.27s -> 900.42s]  even in his hand. Someone's going to take this from me and you'll see how big it. Oh wait,
[900.42s -> 910.09s]  there's a scorn. I'm realizing right now that scorned it is just pain. It's just different
[910.09s -> 915.70s]  color scheme. Look at how big the microphone is. Even if it was in somebody's hand, that's bigger.
[918.78s -> 923.02s]  Act right. I know you're cowering backstage clinging to that inter title of yours.
[923.82s -> 929.99s]  That may be the safest place for you right now, but that treasure can't stay buried forever.
[929.99s -> 960.82s]  If I had the shovel. What's happening? Are we all right? Did I win? All right. This motherfucker
[960.82s -> 988.09s]  has an urn in his hands. Uh, I'm running. What the fuck was that? I don't even have a microphone
[988.09s -> 1003.66s]  anymore. All right, let's keep score. Oh wait, give me that apple. Give me actually give me that
[1003.66s -> 1014.47s]  apple. I want it. My health is so low. Wait, is my health low or did it not save the all the shit
[1014.47s -> 1024.41s]  that happened right when I got beat up backstage? It did. Come on. So this is just a regular match.
[1024.41s -> 1037.56s]  First match of the evening. Let's go. I'm already going to lose. I think I made this guy's stats
[1037.56s -> 1048.86s]  awful. I hope I didn't. Sorry. We're good. The Nat sucks. Well, no, the Nat sucks because I got
[1048.86s -> 1068.90s]  beat up backstage. All right. The character sucks. The character actually a pretty effective way to
[1068.90s -> 1093.99s]  deal with that. Here we go. All right, let's get it back together here. Get up. Okay. There is a
[1093.99s -> 1113.10s]  shovel out there. Oh my God. What the fuck are you doing? God damn it. Tries to leave the arena.
[1113.66s -> 1137.96s]  I've covered in blood already. Oh my God. All right. Already a disaster. Get up, get up, get up,
[1137.96s -> 1146.94s]  get up, get up. All right. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out. Is this illegal?
[1149.06s -> 1172.60s]  Why did the ref get hurt? I'm so screwed. Illegal. Call him out for that. Get him in
[1172.60s -> 1186.09s]  trouble for that. He should be. Are you going to restart? No, I am going to be a coward though.
[1186.09s -> 1198.87s]  You better believe it. Shit. I'm too, I am too short. I'm hitting the ledge when I throw the
[1198.87s -> 1212.01s]  things into the ring. Are you kidding me? All right. I got to do a stand up with this guy.
[1215.40s -> 1225.19s]  All right. I'll be all right. Look, I'm not, you don't win every single match. It's okay.
[1228.52s -> 1250.33s]  What a moron. Advantage. Take the advantage of it. What is with this reversal? Bullshit. Stop.
[1258.82s -> 1263.46s]  He's almost, he's going to get counted out. He's at six right now. I just got to be,
[1263.46s -> 1273.96s]  I got to be an annoying little nat. Just keep him out here and win. He's doing a move to me.
[1275.48s -> 1311.99s]  Oh shit. No, no. Get up. How is he still standing? Here we go. Give me that. Yes. Same deal. Just
[1311.99s -> 1328.86s]  keep him out here. Oh, come on. How did he not fall down from that? The only way I can win is
[1328.86s -> 1336.98s]  if I get him outside. Change the camera settings. What is it on right now? What should I do too?
[1336.98s -> 1341.24s]  I feel like I did change this for some reason when I was making people. What should it be?
[1343.77s -> 1355.11s]  Camera's fine. Is it good? Hard camera. Players only, right? Do first person. Yeah, raise the
[1355.11s -> 1366.04s]  first person. We'll do it later. I think it's fine. Yeah. What are you? I'm an idiot. Although I have
[1366.04s -> 1370.84s]  not lost yet. So we're okay so far. All right. Let me do some actual technical wrestling here.
[1371.56s -> 1404.01s]  Good start. Oh my. He just was palming my face. Can I just go for like a little pin right now?
[1404.01s -> 1411.22s]  That would be so awesome. Technical wrestling. I mean, it'd be great if he didn't reverse every
[1411.22s -> 1421.05s]  single move I did. You suck. Dun, dun. You suck. No, I was just being a little asshole backstage
[1421.05s -> 1425.29s]  and it's what got me into trouble. It's all right. We're going outside. There's only three
[1425.29s -> 1455.82s]  minutes left. How big of a hole can you dig? Can I make a hazard? Stop swinging so much.
[1456.54s -> 1467.96s]  I'm going to win. I'm going to win right now. Oh, it's over. I win. Just don't fuck this up.
[1468.52s -> 1503.19s]  I'm going to win. That's game over right there. First match won. Looks like a VIP. That guy paid
[1503.19s -> 1522.31s]  10 grand for that seat. Who was that guy? I can't make a giant hole, right? What happens if I just
[1522.31s -> 1560.65s]  keep doing this? Can I fall in it? VIP says, okay, let go of my arm, please. I shouldn't walk in by
[1560.65s -> 1574.49s]  that. Somebody in the crowd comes out and puts me in an arm bar. All right. Scored is really good.
[1574.49s -> 1579.53s]  Look at these stats. I try to keep everybody between like 70 and 80, like 72 to 75 ish.
[1580.33s -> 1586.52s]  All right. Well, the math's progress is being hindered by the limitations of wrestling revolution.
[1587.48s -> 1602.78s]  What? Why? But what? The limitations. He has worse stats than everybody in the whole league.
[1603.34s -> 1618.33s]  This is the worst promotion. Oh, so I made everybody in the worst league.
[1619.13s -> 1629.24s]  I wrapped that cash for somebody else. Nat, who said you could open it? Who's talking about it?
[1629.96s -> 1638.71s]  Remember the money that weighed the present in the very beginning? I opened up a present on the
[1638.71s -> 1646.20s]  ground and there was money in it. But dude, why are you putting money into a present and
[1646.20s -> 1655.18s]  just leaving it on the ground? There's so many people around. Okay. All right. So this is the
[1655.18s -> 1662.46s]  really popular one, but everybody in here has like 90, 90, you know, 85, 85, 85 vending machines and
[1662.46s -> 1672.41s]  water bottles. Freeman sumo contest. What is this? What is it? How? Why would it be in a sumo contest?
[1672.41s -> 1680.06s]  Who are the, who are the two of my opponents? Can I see that? Okay. 20 o'clock at two hours.
[1692.31s -> 1702.10s]  The Nat is in a sumo. Yeah, that's weird. Am I going to get in trouble for this? Oh, wait,
[1702.10s -> 1716.65s]  was that for me? What do you think? He was happy about that. Something you want to say to me.
[1720.76s -> 1726.52s]  Um, yeah, I have a proposal for you. What do you have my attention? What do you want to talk about?
[1726.52s -> 1743.22s]  Let's work together. How do you see us working together? Um, can you be my manager?
[1746.65s -> 1750.33s]  Oh, that's right. Okay. All right. Right. Right. If they're in a different, right. Okay.
[1751.42s -> 1756.28s]  If they're in a different company, then you can't do any of this. All right. Well,
[1756.28s -> 1762.26s]  I'm just looking for food on the ground. I've got an hour. Yeah. You have to be in the same
[1762.26s -> 1769.70s]  promotion. And what I remember. Oh, there's Lionel the mountain. He's my friend. So you've got a
[1769.70s -> 1783.78s]  microphone in your gift. I received a sign in mine once. All right. Cool. Very cool. Nice. You got a
[1783.78s -> 1801.74s]  sign. All right. I got to get in there. Any more food on the ground? I'm not going in there with
[1801.74s -> 1813.80s]  half health. Grab the gun. You can't use the gun though. I'll take it. No, it costs money if you
[1813.80s -> 1832.47s]  take it. Right. All right. I think I'm all right. I've got like 70%. No, it costs money. Hot dog.
[1832.47s -> 1839.26s]  If you walk out with a prop, it costs like a hundred and fifty dollars every time. Who's in
[1839.26s -> 1852.15s]  this match? Oh, it's a sumo match. Right. Okay. I get ready. Is it us? Who's in this match?
[1854.97s -> 1875.24s]  Reman sumo contest. Why is there a table on top of their table? That's very confusing.
[1875.24s -> 1888.15s]  Is this for the championship already? This is not for the championship already. Is it?
[1888.95s -> 1903.29s]  What's the. What do you do here? I just hit my fucking head on the stairs at the back of my
[1903.29s -> 1914.18s]  skull. Like the worst part. Like the soft part of your head. I just hit it. Okay. It's red eye.
[1916.15s -> 1922.04s]  Should I put tables in here? I'm sure you think winning a fight involves being on top
[1922.04s -> 1931.10s]  for three precious seconds. Did I set this up? Somebody just got hurt. When you win a real fight,
[1931.10s -> 1945.77s]  the loser doesn't get up ever again. Ow. It hit me right in the face. You dick. Somebody already
[1945.77s -> 1954.87s]  went over the table. What's wrong with this guy? Dude, I'm just going to drink all the fucking
[1954.87s -> 1958.55s]  drinks out here and have full health. Are you serious? The match doesn't start until I go in.
[1963.43s -> 1977.29s]  There's so many drinks out here. I'm going to get to full health. What is this? Is it something on
[1977.29s -> 2006.01s]  fire? What's burning? What happened to you? What are the rules? That's my finishing move.
[2006.65s -> 2020.01s]  Why am I losing health? Is it a pin? If you fall out of the ring, you lose. Oh shit. That's not
[2020.01s -> 2045.99s]  good. All these tables are meaningless then. All right. I got to. So don't get thrown over the top
[2045.99s -> 2059.16s]  ropes. So there's no submissions. There's no nothing. You could help. You could do anything
[2059.16s -> 2064.65s]  right now. All right. So I'm just going to do this. I got a great idea. Are you fucking kidding me?
[2064.65s -> 2093.27s]  Why did I do anything else? Check this out. Now I'm safe. I don't give a shit what happens. I'm
[2093.27s -> 2108.41s]  fine. Just don't get thrown over the top rope. They're both so concerned with wearing the belt.
[2115.02s -> 2120.90s]  Yeah. What are you going to do about it? Nothing. Throw him over. Get him over the top. He's out.
[2120.90s -> 2179.38s]  It's over. I win. Oops. Don't do it. Stop. Oh my God. Get up. I'm trying. How did I miss? I fruit.
[2179.38s -> 2207.75s]  How did I miss that poorly? That was so bad. Get outside. Get outside. What are you? What's
[2212.25s -> 2239.67s]  Okay. The guy won. I was going for a spectacle. I was going for a spectacle. Wait, they are friends?
[2240.39s -> 2261.43s]  But weren't we just fighting? I did pretty well in that. Somebody interfered, but whatever. I won.
[2261.43s -> 2267.26s]  I actually, that was for the championship. That's the second match I've ever had.
[2274.18s -> 2284.84s]  All right. Going pretty well so far. I'm the new champion. That's actually amazing. I can't believe
[2284.84s -> 2297.91s]  it. I heard you smashed a table. We'll never be welcome back in this venue. They were everywhere.
[2298.87s -> 2309.69s]  Why is that my problem? I'm winning your second match. You remain undefeated at wrestling
[2309.69s -> 2318.44s]  revolution. Yep. I'm going to stay that way. Do this thing right here. You dream of this belt
[2318.44s -> 2337.21s]  every day. Do I have a match today? It's only a matter of time before the intertitle is mine.
[2337.21s -> 2352.47s]  You might as well drop it now. Give me that back. You may have beaten me in the ring. What is this
[2352.47s -> 2358.63s]  guy talking about? What the fuck are you doing? Leave me alone. We had a match like two weeks ago
[2358.63s -> 2365.78s]  and it was a regular match. You just, I, well, actually, yeah, actually I kind of didn't I beat
[2365.78s -> 2383.91s]  him with a stick for a while. Am I okay? Oh, it's the end of the show. I'm going, I'm getting out of
[2383.91s -> 2406.71s]  here. I got to go to the hotel. I got to wear my belt. How do I wear it? There we go. Do not
[2406.71s -> 2422.71s]  hit me with a sledgehammer, please. All right. Bedtime. Is this food? What is this? Oh,
[2422.71s -> 2436.97s]  the brass knuckles. They just look huge on me. All right. Go to bed. I think a few from the floor.
[2438.95s -> 2446.70s]  Go to the bar. After eight hours of comfortable sleep, the Nats energy levels are now at 75%.
[2448.78s -> 2467.19s]  Scorned has developed a friendship with Hugh Jazz of Federation Online. Okay. Okay. All right.
[2467.19s -> 2474.20s]  So this is versus, this is a non-title singles match versus Eugene. Then I got nothing tomorrow.
[2474.84s -> 2480.98s]  All right. 21. I need to, I get a heal. I need to, uh, eat food or something. Why would I be
[2480.98s -> 2497.77s]  fighting? Why are we in two completely different weight classes? What's up guys? All right. Just
[2497.77s -> 2511.13s]  need to eat. Just get close to full health. Oh no, there's a spear. I don't want that.
[2514.87s -> 2526.31s]  Imagine eating four double cheeseburgers before a big athletic event. All right. That's good.
[2526.31s -> 2542.36s]  That's good. I don't need anymore. Costs like 10 bucks every time. Eat the table. Skate five. Oh,
[2542.36s -> 2549.91s]  that, wait, you can, can't you? How do I do it? How do you skate? Enjoy it while it lasts,
[2549.91s -> 2556.38s]  but nobody actually believes you're the inter champion. I mean, I, I get it. It's been too,
[2556.38s -> 2575.78s]  it's been two weeks. How do I use it? Not right before a match. Get off. Oh my, I think he
[2575.78s -> 2586.76s]  accidentally just did that. Not right before a match. What the, how do I, I know you can ride
[2586.76s -> 2601.61s]  this. Why can't I ride it? What? This skateboard is mine. Stop. I'm more skillful than you.
[2602.74s -> 2606.42s]  God damn it. I'm actually fucking annoyed right now because I don't want to be fighting these
[2606.42s -> 2625.13s]  people. Give me the skateboard. I have to, I have a match. Why are they all such dicks?
[2629.85s -> 2645.19s]  Somebody said, am I an idiot? I didn't do anything. This guy just jumped me. I can't see where I'm
[2645.19s -> 2670.46s]  going. I have to get in the ring right now. Please. I got to get there in time. I have to
[2670.46s -> 2673.82s]  get there. I have to get there in time. Hopefully the skateboard Uber can get me there quickly.
[2674.54s -> 2699.98s]  This is not the title, right? Is there any food? Look at how tired I am. This, this microphone's
[2699.98s -> 2709.38s]  costing me money every time. I'm fighting the biggest guy in the entire league. This is not
[2709.38s -> 2719.53s]  fair. Those like to keep count. This is the first title I've won in my career. It's also the last
[2719.53s -> 2724.01s]  title you'll ever hold. If you want to make history, I'll make you history. This is not,
[2724.01s -> 2729.61s]  this is actually not fair. Maybe I should start counting title defenses so that you get to be
[2729.61s -> 2746.63s]  another notch on my belt. Just run. Just run. He, okay. Thanks a lot, ref. I appreciate it.
[2753.10s -> 2760.10s]  Somebody is doing this on purpose. You making me fight the huge guy?
[2760.10s -> 2767.14s]  Good luck because I won the belt. Move over the commissioner on his desk. I'm just wearing the
[2767.14s -> 2790.78s]  belt. It's like a toy. What do I do about this? I can't even reach his head. Get him out of the
[2790.78s -> 2801.74s]  ring. Just hit him in the head with a chair over and over again. Holy shit. I can't, I can't. Yeah,
[2801.74s -> 2812.89s]  I have to. I gotta take him outside. I have to rely on weapons to beat this. Test of strength.
[2815.51s -> 2839.48s]  There's no way I was ever going to win this. Get up. That hurt my back so bad. Get the ref
[2839.48s -> 2866.97s]  out of my face. Stop, stop, stop. This is unfair. It's just actually unfair. What was I supposed to
[2866.97s -> 2910.14s]  do about this? I'm out of stamina. I can't even run. God damn it. What am I doing? It's like awkward
[2910.14s -> 2930.98s]  shit. Okay. You got more attitude. What am I supposed to do about that? You can do proceed to
[2930.98s -> 2940.39s]  match. Yeah, but I just, I have to go and just attack people. It just happened. I made, oh no,
[2940.87s -> 2946.90s]  yeah, see the prop. It's $350 every time to take that stupid microphone out. All right,
[2946.90s -> 2955.59s]  get me out of here. Give me the hotel. Sorry to see you lose to Eugene. That knocked your profile
[2955.59s -> 2964.79s]  down to 70%. Yeah, well, you could have helped, couldn't you? See, you lost another match. The
[2964.79s -> 2971.03s]  nat. That brings your win rate down to 67%. One of you two has the math wrong and I don't know
[2971.03s -> 2985.13s]  who to make fun of. So fuck both of you. How's that sound? Still got this, don't I? Still got this.
[2985.77s -> 3014.50s]  Mm hmm. Chumps. Wait, give me the, yeah. It's haunting everybody. What a little shit. Hey,
[3014.50s -> 3032.04s]  whoever can grab this out of my hands gets to keep it. Nobody. I just saw a stool in the bar.
[3032.04s -> 3044.25s]  If that's what you're looking for. No, I wasn't looking for a stool. Hey, by the way, it looks
[3044.25s -> 3056.30s]  like you look like you're struggling. You need a ride to the hospital. Do I? Should I? Do I go?
[3057.43s -> 3069.48s]  Yeah. Don't worry. I'll get you to the hospital as fast as I can. What's the matter with me?
[3070.20s -> 3095.00s]  With my hand? Okay, this is the doctor, right? And I, doctor, can you give me a heel or something?
[3095.00s -> 3103.64s]  Just sleep in the bed? Why are people doing that? Okay, I'm going to bed.
[3105.24s -> 3110.89s]  My attitude is down for no reason. Do you get more health if you sleep in the hospital?
[3112.14s -> 3124.49s]  Sweet warriors. Yeah, it looks like he was going to attack me, but 43%. All right. We tag team
[3124.49s -> 3141.27s]  champions released. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh shit. An ad has been booked to face scratch in an
[3141.27s -> 3149.99s]  inter championship match on the fourth week of May. All right. I gotta get ready. Nothing
[3149.99s -> 3154.81s]  scheduled. All right. This is where I can make up. Uh, let me, so I'm in the hospital. Let me get
[3154.81s -> 3159.99s]  some, let me make, uh, let me get some health. I could probably sleep again. Couldn't I? Let me
[3159.99s -> 3165.90s]  eat first. I'm going to open these presents. Money. I'll take like 400 bucks for no reason.
[3172.71s -> 3191.00s]  All right. Sleep. Okay. I'm all right then. The MPCs are so scary. I'm kind of bleeding money
[3191.00s -> 3209.62s]  though. All right. Lost weight. Okay. Todd's snorting has been released. Steel cage. Oh wait,
[3209.62s -> 3220.22s]  this is tag team versus Eugene's team. All right. Let me get a little bit of revenge here.
[3220.86s -> 3232.14s]  Let's just go right to it. This time I actually have me an Android. I actually have the skateboard
[3232.14s -> 3247.02s]  this time. This is a pretty good team. Android's actually really good. I take the skateboard into
[3247.02s -> 3280.06s]  the gate. This is really fucking dangerous. Um, that was pretty cool. Do a kick flip. How do you
[3280.06s -> 3295.58s]  do a kick flip? Leon lock and Eugene. Wait, this is the guy at the table that I beat up in the very
[3295.58s -> 3340.46s]  beginning that I thought he was a VIP, right? He's not even in the cage. This is not illegal
[3340.46s -> 3354.38s]  what I'm doing by the way. How is this not, how is this allowed? Why should I be allowed to do this?
[3355.10s -> 3380.71s]  Are they booing? How do I kick flip? I can kick flip. How do you kick flip? No, keep him in,
[3380.71s -> 3403.64s]  keep him in. He'll get in trouble. How do you kick flip? I think I, I, did I break it? Wait,
[3403.64s -> 3422.63s]  no, he picked it up. Give me that. Give me that. That's mine. Oh my goodness. Thank you.
[3427.11s -> 3450.46s]  You just have to escape the ring, right? And this house works. Come and get me. He's too big. He
[3450.46s -> 3467.24s]  can't climb. Somebody come get me. Come on. I'm up here waiting for you. I'm up here. Can you
[3467.24s -> 3486.71s]  actually do a kick flip? No, you can't. Shit. I'm not in trouble. I could just beat him with it.
[3495.50s -> 3513.00s]  Do not let him do that. Oh, she's got money. She has money. I want it. She's bringing money.
[3513.00s -> 3559.59s]  Do I want that money? You stay in the ring. Where'd it go? Yes, I got it. You fucking idiot.
[3560.31s -> 3580.18s]  I'm it. I think I'm still all right. Get up. What are you doing? What is wrong with you?
[3584.52s -> 3609.50s]  Did I just lose the belt? I didn't lose the belt. Wait, it's not over. It's not over. I can't.
[3612.76s -> 3623.00s]  Is he climbing out of here? Why is the ref climbing out? It's because the tag team. All right.
[3623.00s -> 3638.30s]  But I need to, they don't even, they like, don't know what to do. I can't climb it. Yeah. I can't
[3638.30s -> 3648.54s]  climb. I'm stuck out here. Come on. There we go. I just shook it. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.
[3648.54s -> 3672.28s]  I can still affect the game. Where am I? Switch characters. I feel like it's more fun this way.
[3689.78s -> 3727.80s]  First person. I feel like I'm going to puke. Hey, who's winning? Whose arm is that? I want the bat.
[3727.80s -> 3766.01s]  I don't have any weapon in my hand. Dude, get this shit out of the, there we go. I feel like I'm in
[3766.01s -> 3800.02s]  VR. Get him. Get him. What's wrong? He's trying to attack me. He's so big. He's like wedged in.
[3800.42s -> 3848.50s]  Three. We did it. Oh, that's my belt. Get up here. Shit. I think I just puked.
[3850.01s -> 3870.33s]  That's a green slime come out of me. We did it. I can keep the title.
[3873.11s -> 3889.21s]  Suffered considerably. Good. Yep. The androids is not supposed to be here. Okay. Your character is
[3889.21s -> 3905.26s]  so annoying. Here I'm a missing 450 splash compilation video. I forgot just how
[3906.14s -> 3911.06s]  unbelievable this game really is. It's just so unbelievable. I want to wish you luck in your
[3911.06s -> 3919.26s]  match tonight, Nat. Okay. After all, dangerous things happen back here and it would be a shame
[3919.26s -> 3927.91s]  if you ended up crawling to the ring, but neither of us want that, right? So hand over $760 and I'll
[3927.91s -> 3939.90s]  let you live. You're not even worth my time. I'll get you when you least expect it. I'm not going
[3939.90s -> 3955.02s]  to give you a thousand dollars almost, but what non-title. This is the first blood match
[3955.02s -> 3961.27s]  versus act, right? I gotta be careful. If you notice, I believe I've been bleeding every single
[3961.27s -> 3987.16s]  match from the very beginning. I'm like, okay, I got pretty good health. What's up? You want that?
[3987.16s -> 4006.25s]  Is it good? I didn't. I was trying to put the, I was trying to put the belt back on. This caused
[4006.25s -> 4020.82s]  mayhem. All right. Well, I'm not, I'm not messing around. Press room. Oh, this food in here.
[4020.82s -> 4043.29s]  I thought I'd lose agility. It's unhealthy. I thought it was in the water. Get down before
[4043.29s -> 4061.14s]  someone gets hurt. Okay. I'll get down. Yeah. You can't put that in the compilation. Oh, it's not
[4061.14s -> 4083.93s]  my time yet. I'm going out there with a, I'm going out there with a desk. Wait, it's my time. What
[4083.93s -> 4094.33s]  about your belt? Oh, who cares about the belt? The belt's mine. It doesn't matter who's carrying
[4094.33s -> 4110.79s]  it. I guess I own that belt. I gotta get rid of the microphones. They just, I'm bleeding money.
[4111.67s -> 4121.06s]  Is this the championship match or no? Those first blood. All right. My goal is to get something
[4121.06s -> 4128.07s]  heavy and throw it right in their face in the very beginning. You know what I'm saying? Like
[4128.07s -> 4133.46s]  throw it, throw the iPad directly into the mouth and instantly first blood or it's the chair.
[4134.18s -> 4141.74s]  What would, that would probably cause blood first, right? Yeah. Like horizontal in the teeth.
[4141.74s -> 4165.34s]  They'll line it up. It's going to be immediate. Go ahead. Start talking and act right. I'm sure
[4165.34s -> 4173.06s]  you're very excited to be standing in the ring with a champion like me, but we both know that
[4173.06s -> 4180.23s]  you do not belong here. So there's no point in making this match for the title. Figure yourself
[4180.95s -> 4184.95s]  as my sparring partner and perhaps you'll benefit from the experience I'm offering you.
[4185.51s -> 4191.98s]  Don't patronize me the nat. We both know why you're scared to put your title on the line.
[4196.60s -> 4217.43s]  Shit. Blood, blood. Wait, I am bleeding too. What, what is that? How do we, I thought it was first
[4217.43s -> 4233.18s]  blood. What, what exploded? What happened? What's going on? iPad blew up in my face.
[4233.82s -> 4240.42s]  I'm all right. It's all right. I'm fine. Fine. Fine. How is that not blood? I'm so confused.
[4244.38s -> 4271.94s]  How do I, it's, there's a lot of blood on the ground. That's me. Oh, so, okay.
[4273.06s -> 4285.61s]  So he's bleeding an explosive went off in my face and there was blood pouring on the ground. Nice.
[4286.65s -> 4318.52s]  I want, what happened? Why the lights off? Let me give the audience a show for a second.
[4335.14s -> 4353.70s]  Why is it? Who cut the lights? There we go. All right. I didn't know this was the worst promotion.
[4360.22s -> 4392.30s]  Again, $149 for the mic. I got 10 grand. There was a landmine desk, I guess. I saw you get smashed
[4392.30s -> 4401.91s]  with that desk. Hope you're feeling better now. I mean, I feel all right. I was shaking my hand.
[4401.91s -> 4413.99s]  Are we hugging? Oh, okay. It's a friend. Where's the owner? I want to talk to, I want to talk to
[4413.99s -> 4433.50s]  the owner. I hope that's not the owner. Are you the owner? Who owns this place? Should I not be in
[4433.50s -> 4436.70s]  here? These, it looks like they're working some, they're, they're working something out in here.
[4437.18s -> 4461.26s]  Oh, that's Lionel the mountain. I'm just going to go to sleep. Get a good night rest.
[4461.26s -> 4482.49s]  Hi. Why are you tracking me? What's going on? What? What? Hi. Hotel time. I want, I want to go
[4482.49s -> 4499.03s]  for the world championship. I think I could get it. She fell off the bench. Don't I have a title
[4499.03s -> 4519.78s]  match coming up? What? Evan Gillette could not be woken from his sleep this morning. The 57 year
[4519.78s -> 4535.48s]  old veteran is thought to have died of natural causes. Okay. That's too bad. Stage a special
[4535.48s -> 4539.56s]  tribute memory of Evan Gillette. Prior to the public show, private funeral will take place at
[4539.56s -> 4567.86s]  5 PM. Okay. 5 PM at the cemetery. Sounds like right now. I gotta go. Get up. Where's the cemetery?
[4570.84s -> 4587.88s]  Okay. It's gym cemetery or airport cemetery. Where is it? Hospital cemetery. Where's the,
[4587.88s -> 4600.81s]  where is it? It's hospital is all the way to the behind the gym. So this way it is. Is that it?
[4601.45s -> 4611.32s]  That was this underground. Shit. It's the other side. Go take the, I don't leave the belt. I've
[4611.32s -> 4615.16s]  got this. I got a funeral to go to. Go, go, go, go, go. Hurry. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
[4615.16s -> 4634.14s]  go, go. Oops. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,
[4634.14s -> 4637.80s]  get out of the way, get out of the way, get out of the way. I'm sorry. I can see in the
[4637.80s -> 4651.10s]  mirror where I am. I gotta go to a funeral. Where is it? Okay. Here we go. Thanks for attending the
[4651.10s -> 4659.58s]  funeral. Evan Gillette would be happy to see this turnout. Before anybody says anything in public at
[4659.58s -> 4668.20s]  tonight's show, we thought it might be more appropriate to gather here. He would have also
[4668.20s -> 4675.22s]  wanted your lives to go on. He would want the show to go on. Okay. Evan Gillette can never take
[4675.22s -> 4682.49s]  another step in this world, so we must appreciate the time we have. Just for one day, let's put
[4682.49s -> 4701.42s]  aside the fighting and respect each other as fellow warriors. Okay. I'm into that. Where's,
[4701.42s -> 4730.57s]  um, where's the, where's the, which casket is his? Okay. I'm just shaking everybody's hands.
[4730.57s -> 4738.78s]  Put it down. That guy has the tombstone. That guy has the tombstone. That's, I would put,
[4738.78s -> 4761.62s]  put that down, please. I'm not going to start anything. Can I play a song? Keep it up. All
[4761.62s -> 4793.80s]  right. He's a hot dog. Wait, there was a little altercation over here. I have to keep my friends
[4793.80s -> 4796.76s]  close to my enemies. Now I only see you suffering and I'm glad I don't have to keep the
[4797.40s -> 4822.98s]  pretense anymore. Don't worry. I'll take care of blonde blunder for you. That's not this guy's
[4822.98s -> 4829.56s]  name. This guy's name is Scratch, not the blonde blunder. Who is he referring to?
[4829.56s -> 4842.94s]  Can we find the blonde blunder? I don't see a person here named blonde blunder.
[4845.82s -> 4859.06s]  I mean, it's got, I mean, the guy with the blonde hair? No. Who else has blonde hair? Not you.
[4859.78s -> 4879.16s]  Is it you? I don't know who this guy's protecting me from. No, it's my broom. You can't have it.
[4879.16s -> 4905.70s]  No, it's not for sale. I found it. It's mine. The guy's got adrenaline from being on the phone.
[4905.70s -> 4919.50s]  Okay. I think that's good. We did the funerals over. Okay. It's time for the match. I have a
[4919.50s -> 4944.46s]  match today against one of, against one of these people here. I have a match. You give me that.
[4944.46s -> 4981.99s]  This is so big. Heard you crapped yourself. When? Let's go. I'll deal with you on the first week of
[4981.99s -> 5009.11s]  June. Get out of my sight and prepare. All right. Bring it on. I made it. What? This show is dedicated
[5009.11s -> 5017.90s]  to the memory of Evan Gillette who recently passed away. Yeah. Evan Gillette's work in this
[5017.90s -> 5025.38s]  ring meant a lot to fans, but the person was backstage. What's happening? What's happening?
[5026.84s -> 5042.36s]  What's happening? We're not in a ring. We're not in a ring. Who am I versus? There's no one here.
[5042.36s -> 5082.01s]  There's nobody here. There's nobody even here. What's happening? Ow. Why? Okay. I guess we'll just
[5082.01s -> 5090.76s]  wait till we get there. Hey, don't forget. That's my belt back there. It doesn't matter who has it.
[5090.76s -> 5094.68s]  It's like a library card. I fucking own the book. You're just cashing it out. Wait.
[5095.56s -> 5143.00s]  Fuck you. Yeah, that was easy. The three stooges routine. I'm going to beat the shit out of this guy.
[5143.80s -> 5163.56s]  Once I get out of this, I'll be okay. Oh, great. At least I'm holding the belt. That's all I care
[5163.56s -> 5181.06s]  about. No, no, no, no. Okay. Now I got you motherfucker. Sit in your seat. Sit back in
[5181.06s -> 5193.66s]  your seat. Sit back in your seat. Sit down. Sit down. Oh, that's real, real cute. Okay.
[5194.22s -> 5213.24s]  Just sitting down. Okay. All right. Hit me in the back of the head. He caught me.
[5222.07s -> 5241.83s]  No. Give me that. Give me that. This guy just keeps scooping me up. Ow. I'm not going to let
[5241.83s -> 5268.97s]  him win. No way. I can't. This guy is so hard to knock down. Oh shit. Thanks. Why are you
[5270.68s -> 5287.96s]  pitting this guy for no reason? Grab him. Grab him. Grab him. Grab him. Grab him. Grab him. Grab him.
[5288.60s -> 5304.74s]  Yeah. How is this a Memorial match? I think we were scheduled to have the Memorial match,
[5304.74s -> 5322.70s]  but then he just hates me and like fighting me on the plane. Fine. I'll grab this. You're in the
[5322.70s -> 5357.46s]  way. Get out of the way. Oh my God. What is this? Is this a piece of glass? You ruined everything.
[5357.46s -> 5393.82s]  That would have been so cool. Don't. I'm so weak. Yeah. This is the worst Memorial match I've ever,
[5393.90s -> 5403.13s]  ever seen. It's just two people trying to hurt each other. They're trying to do permanent damage
[5403.13s -> 5429.22s]  to each other. Oh my God. Get off of me. Let's get out of the seat. All right. I got the upper hand
[5429.22s -> 5478.71s]  now. Oh my God. You have to be kidding me. When did we get off the plane? We're still in the air.
[5479.27s -> 5531.10s]  Where is he going? So much blood. The Nat has damaged the reputation of Wrestling Revolution
[5531.10s -> 5541.70s]  by failing to win that inter-promotional contest. That was very bizarre. That was a very strange
[5541.70s -> 5557.96s]  day. That was his client. Okay. I mean, I got to get out of Wrestling Revolution then.
[5562.46s -> 5581.16s]  It's a huge banana. All right. No more messing around. Actually get to full health. Back to the
[5581.16s -> 5591.69s]  hotel room. You got to make Miku. Well, we're currently invested in the Nat. We will make Miku,
[5592.25s -> 5603.70s]  but I need to see how this arc ends. I'm still carrying around the tombstone. Yeah. That's not
[5603.70s -> 5621.30s]  messed up at all. Come down with an illness. Wait, what? Speaking tour has been hired in
[5621.30s -> 5635.86s]  controversy after sharing some inflammatory views with the students. Okay. Oh, this is important.
[5635.86s -> 5644.06s]  This is versus, um, this is versus scratch. Okay. This is the title match. I can't screw this up.
[5644.62s -> 5661.05s]  Just give me a water. Give me, uh, something to drink. Careful. Listen, the Nat, a lot has
[5661.05s -> 5669.13s]  changed since we first signed you to 1400 per week. Uh-huh. We all have to make sacrifices to
[5669.13s -> 5679.56s]  stay afloat. So how would you feel about taking a pay cut? I'm the champion right now. You know,
[5679.56s -> 5686.78s]  you're going to pay cut the champion? No, that's not happening. We'll find some other way to
[5686.78s -> 5697.34s]  balance the books. I'm the champion. I am the intercontinental champion. Are you seriously going
[5697.34s -> 5718.17s]  to talk to me like that? All right. We'll help. All right. Get me out of here. Don't do anything
[5718.17s -> 5727.10s]  dumb. Don't provoke anybody on the street. Don't bite anybody. Don't just leave the belt. Don't
[5727.10s -> 5738.31s]  provoke anybody. Okay. Anything in the gym I could use. I could train. What do I have stats right
[5738.31s -> 5750.09s]  now? No, no, I'll turn on an off day. Conference is starting in the press room. There's more to
[5750.09s -> 5758.74s]  this business than what takes place in the ring. The Nat. Why don't you join us for a drink to
[5758.74s -> 5765.10s]  unwind? It would probably wouldn't cost more than a hundred dollars. I have a match in 40 minutes.
[5765.74s -> 5786.36s]  All right. Fine. Yeah. We can't hurt. What? What happened to my health? I'm on my way to the studio.
[5786.36s -> 5795.03s]  Do you need a ride? Um, yeah. All right. I, yes. I'll go with you. Please take me to the studio.
[5795.03s -> 5815.56s]  No problem. Just follow me and I'll get you to the studio as soon as possible. All right. When I,
[5815.56s -> 5827.48s]  I want an interview. I want to interview for the game. Let me sit in this chair. You look exhausted.
[5827.48s -> 5832.22s]  Why don't you take a nap where there's still time? Can you guys stop telling me what to do today?
[5832.22s -> 5840.26s]  This is a, this is a sham. Oh, come, come get, come get drunk an hour before the match.
[5840.90s -> 5849.08s]  Hey dude, you should take a nap 20 minutes before the match. They all, they want me to lose.
[5849.08s -> 5879.45s]  This is a league wide conspiracy. Welcome to this inter-championship clash between scratch and the
[5879.45s -> 5889.85s]  Nat scratch. Could you start us off on how you intend to cope with the Nat? I got drunk before
[5889.85s -> 5899.13s]  a title match. The Nat is in no state to compete and I won't be taking it easy on him. You think
[5899.13s -> 5909.70s]  I'm going to be easy on you? How do you respond? I earn more than scratch and I'll prove why I'm
[5909.70s -> 5918.41s]  worth every penny. Is that the potential be the best match on the card? So buy your ticket to see
[5918.41s -> 5939.35s]  it live. Oh, it's time. Okay. Wait, I have to, this is a title match. I can't mess this up.
[5940.07s -> 5969.42s]  Food, tombstone. All right. This is huge. If I go, I can go out there with this lucky bastard.
[5970.50s -> 5974.02s]  I am okay. That's like one of the most popular people in the world. I almost just ruined
[5974.02s -> 5996.10s]  everything. As you may have heard in the news, my contract with wrestling revolution expires
[5996.10s -> 6004.74s]  next week. If chef Buffalo and I can't come to an agreement, this might very well be my last
[6004.74s -> 6009.80s]  appearance. And that in case that happens, I want to take this opportunity to express how much I've
[6009.80s -> 6043.03s]  enjoyed. All right. Don't fuck it up. He's got something to prove. I don't one, two, three.
[6043.75s -> 6070.36s]  Okay. Just do moves, do moves, get set up. Good. I'm getting fucked up. No, I'm not. I just did
[6070.36s -> 6094.46s]  like three moves in a row, but that was unfair. I just got like scooped up. He's ripping off your
[6094.46s -> 6108.26s]  head. I'm fine. I'm all right. Come on. Don't be like this. If you win this, can you play Fortnite?
[6108.26s -> 6116.09s]  I've never played Fortnite ever again. I just, that's never happening ever again. Put that down.
[6116.09s -> 6126.62s]  That's illegal. I put it down on the ground and he hit my head into it while it was falling. I fell
[6126.62s -> 6136.57s]  on top of it with his hand on my head. This is getting ugly. We might have to go with the
[6136.57s -> 6140.89s]  strat. And the strat is just beg him to come outside and beat him with a weapon until he's
[6140.89s -> 6181.42s]  dead. That's the strat. God damn it. He was so much more prepared than I was. Get him off.
[6198.81s -> 6210.84s]  Oh my God. He's going to beat me. I'm going to lose the title. No, I'm not. I grabbed him and
[6210.84s -> 6229.94s]  he reversed it immediately. What are you doing? Who's doing what? Go outside the ring.
[6236.10s -> 6240.82s]  Okay. Here we go guys. It's time to, it's time for me to win a match in wrestling revolution.
[6242.34s -> 6263.86s]  Run outside. That's what happens every time. He's smart. He's much smarter than anybody else I've
[6263.86s -> 6295.99s]  fought. He's not taking the bait here. He's too smart. Good. Oh no. How would you let your head
[6295.99s -> 6326.92s]  be that vulnerable? Catch your breath. He's not coming in yet. Five minutes. God. I'm just trying
[6326.92s -> 6331.48s]  to get some punches in. He's got so much more reach than I do. Look at his arms. His arms and
[6331.48s -> 6355.35s]  legs are so much taller. It's not fair. He missed. That's good. You're so bad at this. This character
[6355.35s -> 6376.50s]  is four feet tall. I can't do anything. I have to get out of the ring. How's that not a rope break?
[6376.50s -> 6395.48s]  I'm right here. All right. We're good. We're good. We're okay. Three minutes, four minutes.
[6415.43s -> 6425.88s]  Get him. More pressure on the neck. More pressure on his neck. Was I in that? How did I get caught
[6425.88s -> 6461.16s]  by that? You reverse every move I do. I'm going to get a weapon. He reversed it again. Reversed
[6461.16s -> 6482.04s]  again. Get the pin. Get the pin. Pin, pin, pin, pin, pin. You reversed the pin, didn't you?
[6483.42s -> 6492.84s]  Oh, this is bad. Zero health. Referee's not in here though, so that's good.
[6492.84s -> 6537.22s]  Come on. Who am I doing? How did that miss? There's no way it missed. He hit his head on it.
[6537.22s -> 6559.66s]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, you got six twice. It's over. I'm gonna lose the title. No
[6560.30s -> 6567.66s]  Still counts. I have to pit him. I have to pit him. I have to fit him
[6568.14s -> 6594.58s]  What if it's a tie? I don't lose the title, right? Uh-oh don't
[6600.50s -> 6606.26s]  Oh, it's anybody's game
[6606.26s -> 6608.44s]  You want this motherfucker?
[6608.44s -> 6615.67s]  You want this you want this you're gonna have to take it out of my cold
[6616.15s -> 6633.45s]  Dead hands one. Oh, that's what happens. No win. Sorry. You don't win
[6634.17s -> 6658.02s]  I get to keep the title. You can't lift that. Why?
[6658.90s -> 6683.67s]  Why does it have set? Why does it have 10 minutes on the clock?
[6699.21s -> 6703.54s]  Yeah, fuck you. You didn't win the title. Stop. Why are you doing this?
[6703.70s -> 6716.38s]  That guy told me that I was not gonna be alive after this didn't he? Or is that somebody else?
[6719.08s -> 6728.36s]  Wait, why did your profile rise? By the way, how much money does uh scratch make? Because I make
[6728.74s -> 6734.92s]  1400 and that was all of my argument was I made way more money. How much more money do I make than scratch?
[6742.84s -> 6753.53s]  Why would we know it wouldn't it would have just said it wouldn't that was pay-per-view
[6754.26s -> 6762.58s]  All right, still the champion. I can't believe I won the championship in the second match
[6762.58s -> 6769.78s]  Why would I why was I even given a title match? Oh you wrapped that gift for me
[6771.56s -> 6774.63s]  Really appreciate that
[6779.58s -> 6805.35s]  Thanks, how much is it costing a lot of money to keep this thing with me at all times? These are my friends, right?
[6805.99s -> 6811.29s]  That's why we're sharing the hotel room. Um, I need I want this is why I need
[6812.09s -> 6820.25s]  Uh, how do I wake up the android? Um, it's good to see you
[6820.81s -> 6822.81s]  But can I sleep in the bed, please?
[6830.70s -> 6835.10s]  I don't want to hurt you
[6835.10s -> 6839.02s]  But why I need to sleep in the bed. I need to sleep
[6840.49s -> 6844.79s]  Get down
[6844.79s -> 6863.99s]  Did he say what did he say? There's a cardboard box at the airport. Who cares?
[6864.55s -> 6872.95s]  Who cares if that's what you're looking for. Don't wake me up
[6873.03s -> 6882.26s]  It's a cardboard box if you know if that's what you're looking for
[6887.88s -> 6889.24s]  Mike geranus
[6889.24s -> 6907.94s]  Okay, only 57 a lot of releases a lot of free agents
[6908.50s -> 6916.34s]  Okay

[6938.47s -> 6950.68s]  Appreciate it. Thank you
[6950.68s -> 6952.92s]  Down with that sort of thing. Can you play the piano?
[6967.27s -> 6969.27s]  Appreciate it. Thanks bill
[6969.83s -> 6981.22s]  I'm looking for the right person to pass my legacy on to I think you have what it takes
[6981.62s -> 6988.15s]  How would you like to be the next big bob orson as your mentor? I could teach you everything I know
[6991.51s -> 6996.07s]  Is this a joke?
[6996.07s -> 7001.43s]  Is this your idea of of playing a little prank on the gnat the smallest guy in the league think that's funny
[7003.11s -> 7006.95s]  Sure, i'll do it
[7006.95s -> 7010.71s]  Glad you're as enthusiastic about this as I am. There's nobody else i'd rather pass the torch to
[7012.60s -> 7015.16s]  Uh-huh. Cool. So now what?
[7015.88s -> 7035.38s]  Okay, big bob orson
[7040.73s -> 7042.82s]  I'm not big
[7042.82s -> 7044.79s]  My name's not bob
[7044.79s -> 7046.79s]  So this is going to be very interesting
[7046.87s -> 7060.02s]  I'm wearing different clothes
[7060.02s -> 7070.23s]  Wait, I just took his look that's it. That's all it is. It's just oh, hey, by the way here here are some clothing options
[7070.95s -> 7082.94s]  So i'm not even the gnat anymore get away from me. Do you like this trophy?
[7083.34s -> 7085.34s]  Seems like you need it more than I do. Um
[7086.78s -> 7094.50s]  Okay. Yeah, i'll take it. You're welcome. That's what friends are for
[7099.80s -> 7103.88s]  Why did you be backed up very very cautiously? I'm gonna look down. It's gonna be like looney tunes
[7104.12s -> 7122.73s]  It's gonna be dynamite in here. Well, thanks changing your finishing move to the power bomb means you're finished
[7136.31s -> 7142.15s]  Um, I didn't want to do that. That was fucking fantastic
[7144.18s -> 7151.75s]  Fantastic. I'm so happy that I did that i'm very happy
[7155.13s -> 7157.13s]  No, I want to you can't you use it

[7189.16s -> 7194.71s]  It's just mini me. I will call him
[7195.75s -> 7205.85s]  Mini me
[7205.85s -> 7210.33s]  I'm pleased to confirm that I will now be wrestling under the watchful eye of big bob orson
[7213.50s -> 7217.50s]  My rookie days are over. It's time to get serious and I couldn't ask for a better person to guide me
[7221.67s -> 7225.35s]  Everybody knows that hired help is a sign that somebody can't cope on their own
[7228.94s -> 7232.30s]  All the help in the world can't prevent you from losing to me right now
[7232.94s -> 7242.71s]  What is this match?
[7242.71s -> 7243.83s]  What?
[7243.83s -> 7246.90s]  Wait, what happened?
[7247.54s -> 7250.28s]  Did we lose what team am I on?
[7250.92s -> 7254.14s]  I don't even know what
[7254.14s -> 7257.02s]  I don't even know what team i'm on that guy's eliminated too
[7258.89s -> 7260.97s]  Who's whose team what who's in the ring?
[7268.38s -> 7278.15s]  What is going on?
[7278.15s -> 7281.10s]  It's a furniture rumble
[7281.26s -> 7282.30s]  Oh
[7282.30s -> 7287.54s]  Learned that from fucking bob orson
[7295.69s -> 7297.77s]  So it's just everybody in the ring at the same time
[7299.58s -> 7303.18s]  Don't break the table because I think that's how you got that first guy got eliminated that way. I think
[7303.74s -> 7308.10s]  What is that?
[7308.10s -> 7311.66s]  What is this?
[7311.66s -> 7314.70s]  Those are thumb tacks. These are thumb tacks
[7316.44s -> 7318.57s]  Holy shit. Are you kidding me?
[7318.57s -> 7337.27s]  Those are thumb tacks
[7337.27s -> 7338.87s]  Thank god. It didn't hit me
[7338.87s -> 7358.34s]  I'm gonna tax
[7358.34s -> 7362.09s]  On the taxi. These people are so stupid
[7362.89s -> 7368.46s]  Like you are so dumb
[7368.46s -> 7382.04s]  It didn't break. It didn't break. I'm good. I'm good. It didn't break. That's a win. I just won
[7384.54s -> 7386.54s]  Thanks. Wait, thanks
[7386.70s -> 7388.70s]  Scally for coming in and helping me
[7391.61s -> 7393.61s]  I have no idea what's going on
[7393.77s -> 7395.77s]  I just know that I want
[7397.75s -> 7402.09s]  Oh, that's bob. I'm sorry bob
[7402.09s -> 7403.45s]  That was a mess
[7403.45s -> 7425.08s]  Okay, that was for the title that has cemented his reign by defending the inter-championship
[7426.26s -> 7428.57s]  Okay, their profiles suffered
[7428.89s -> 7432.73s]  Yep. Well, I mean he jumped out of the ring and landed on his back through a table
[7432.89s -> 7434.89s]  Of course, he's gonna lose popularity. That was dumb
[7435.93s -> 7443.93s]  That was really dumb
[7447.61s -> 7449.50s]  Okay
[7449.50s -> 7451.26s]  Oh, I have to pay
[7451.26s -> 7459.96s]  Management now. So let me get this right. He came in to help. Is that what it was?
[7460.76s -> 7470.87s]  And I already have bob orson though go to the barber. Where's the barber?
[7471.91s -> 7473.59s]  Uh next to the bar
[7473.59s -> 7496.23s]  Okay, who's the barber?
[7505.90s -> 7513.64s]  Are you the barber? Oh
[7519.40s -> 7530.44s]  um
[7530.44s -> 7531.56s]  You won't let me
[7531.56s -> 7536.38s]  I think I
[7536.38s -> 7546.04s]  Dedicated my whole character arc to bob orson. So I can't do anything. Hey andrew
[7546.04s -> 7550.47s]  I just want to let you know you should probably face the desk the other way
[7551.11s -> 7562.50s]  This is a terrible reception desk should be over here. What are you doing out this late?
[7562.98s -> 7597.94s]  Never mind. Actually, it is pretty late. Isn't it phone with the phone? Oh, whatever. Just go to bed
[7612.46s -> 7621.67s]  There's a lot of people that are in this hotel room now. There's like four of us. I keep adding people to the house
[7621.99s -> 7635.30s]  This is another championship versus gil
[7637.26s -> 7639.86s]  Okay
[7639.86s -> 7641.86s]  All right. I'm i'm not messing around
[7641.94s -> 7645.58s]  I gotta defend the title
[7645.58s -> 7656.71s]  I actually think this character is pretty strong
[7668.44s -> 7670.44s]  Wait bob orson comes up with me every time
[7684.15s -> 7686.15s]  I'm so small
[7687.62s -> 7690.90s]  Oh, this is so weird. This is weird, isn't it?
[7691.70s -> 7701.14s]  Hey gil, can you believe that we've been booked to face each other in this match?
[7701.94s -> 7708.28s]  Things could get awkward, but I hope you appreciate that. I can't go easy on you just because we're friends. Oh, that's right. We're friends
[7710.76s -> 7713.72s]  Don't worry. I wouldn't have it any other way. I can't afford to lose this match either
[7722.10s -> 7730.38s]  Get him this character is so bad
[7731.26s -> 7733.26s]  Everything is reversed
[7766.65s -> 7776.65s]  Gil's too strong. This is no this guy is just he's too small. That's an advantage right there. I think all right here we go
[7777.05s -> 7787.72s]  Wrestle time
[7787.72s -> 7790.92s]  If I lose this title match, i'm going to retire this guy and make miku
[7803.06s -> 7805.06s]  Stop reversing everything
[7831.26s -> 7833.69s]  What you're rooting against me?
[7833.77s -> 7835.77s]  lose lose lose
[7843.22s -> 7851.18s]  Put me in the middle of the ring
[7851.18s -> 7858.92s]  It's comparable still this guy walk. How do you block everything?
[7863.26s -> 7871.75s]  It's over i'm gonna lose title. That's a rope break. That's a rope break. Am I all right?
[7873.64s -> 7875.64s]  Like if I just scream
[7879.54s -> 7881.14s]  Shit, that's it

[7965.70s -> 7969.66s]  Congratulations to gil for becoming the new inter champion of wrestling revolution
[7971.10s -> 7974.22s]  Big bob orson is disappointed that his client lost that match
[7974.86s -> 7978.87s]  Oh, you didn't help at all
[7978.87s -> 7986.54s]  Do miku with every stat maxed? No, that's
[7987.93s -> 7990.62s]  Gotta give it a little bit of challenge
[7990.62s -> 7998.30s]  Uh-oh, we're running short of staff tonight. Would you sit in on commentary for the next match? Oh, would you have to do this first?
[7999.61s -> 8000.49s]  Yeah
[8000.49s -> 8036.34s]  Okay 630 bucks. Okay. So this is the oh, this is rain man

[8048.25s -> 8051.53s]  And that will be joining us on commentary to share his insights in this match
[8052.09s -> 8059.22s]  You know what it takes to win. So how long do you see this match going for?
[8063.69s -> 8070.68s]  Uh, it's gonna take less than five minutes. He heard it here first and that thinks this match will be over and soon
[8070.76s -> 8072.12s]  Let's find out
[8072.12s -> 8111.96s]  Who's this other guy in a suit? I disappeared into the crowd. Oh, there I am
[8119.16s -> 8122.28s]  This is such a little shit. I'm just supposed to be hanging out
[8122.84s -> 8128.31s]  I'm just ruining everything
[8128.31s -> 8163.27s]  This guy seriously just dodged it three times. I can't take it out of his hand
[8170.10s -> 8177.29s]  I swear this guy is just everything gets reversed even when they don't even see me doing anything. I'm behind that guy
[8177.77s -> 8179.69s]  He didn't even know I was there
[8179.69s -> 8183.05s]  And I went to go hit him in the head with the bell and he dove out of the way
[8186.94s -> 8188.94s]  By the way, I won. I was right
[8189.42s -> 8193.43s]  The real winner tonight is you than that you predicted this match would be quick
[8194.23s -> 8196.31s]  Almost as quick as your ankles are gonna snap
[8205.77s -> 8207.37s]  Oh my god
[8207.37s -> 8223.93s]  This guy's so fucked up. You seem a little sore
[8224.57s -> 8236.50s]  Okay, you damaged the reputation of the
[8237.30s -> 8240.04s]  Okay, who will meet?
[8241.91s -> 8247.00s]  Okay

[8249.00s -> 8251.40s]  No, chef buffalo with perfect shawn
[8252.28s -> 8260.12s]  Okay
[8260.12s -> 8263.32s]  This is wait. Hold on a minute. We have a confrontation with big bob orson
[8267.18s -> 8274.30s]  What's this about?
[8274.30s -> 8285.74s]  What's this about miku you promised I know but this is important. This is important lore here
[8288.34s -> 8292.58s]  I'm about to have a confrontation with my mentor the person who I took all their clothes
[8293.22s -> 8295.22s]  And pretended to be them for the last three weeks
[8295.70s -> 8317.82s]  What does he want now? I've been carrying you for long. It's about time. I dropped you
[8320.39s -> 8323.91s]  Sure propping you up made me stronger, but I also held me back from everything I could be
[8326.15s -> 8330.07s]  Once I'm unchanged from you. I'll be free to go as far as I want in any direction I choose
[8330.23s -> 8332.23s]  So am I supposed to just take the
[8332.39s -> 8338.14s]  You never even felt my full weight big bob orson. You'll find it was better to be with me than against me
[8338.62s -> 8345.72s]  Can I put my old clothes back on?
[8345.72s -> 8347.72s]  It doesn't say anything about no weapons
[8349.03s -> 8352.65s]  Sorry bob
[8352.65s -> 8355.72s]  Yeah, hope you got it
[8360.38s -> 8362.46s]  They can only be one bob orson. I'm sorry
[8363.58s -> 8366.65s]  It's got the same idea too. One of us one of us has to go
[8368.01s -> 8370.01s]  They can only be one bob orson
[8370.17s -> 8371.53s]  It's gonna be me
[8371.53s -> 8414.09s]  my god

[8440.86s -> 8463.32s]  Zero oh no
[8484.22s -> 8489.32s]  Uh-oh listen nat did you ever stop to think that the heat between us doesn't have to be so destructive
[8491.05s -> 8494.25s]  You just watched what I just did to bob orson on the the backstage camera
[8494.89s -> 8501.11s]  I'm joined forces
[8501.11s -> 8508.78s]  Don't I already I have three friends already. Sorry. I don't have more than room room for more than three friends

[8546.36s -> 8548.52s]  This one or like strong style or something?
[8549.80s -> 8557.11s]  Do a different one
[8557.11s -> 8571.08s]  How's this one? But wait a minute i'm
[8571.88s -> 8573.88s]  In the middle of the career
[8574.54s -> 8576.54s]  With the nat I can't stop
[8583.03s -> 8585.03s]  Retire the net
[8587.77s -> 8589.94s]  Just should I just
[8589.94s -> 8592.34s]  Yes, you can just make the net miko
[8593.88s -> 8599.64s]  Can you can I just do that?
[8599.64s -> 8600.68s]  Can I?
[8600.68s -> 8602.68s]  Yeah, but I don't want to be in this
[8602.92s -> 8610.10s]  league

[8623.35s -> 8635.90s]  So you want to end your career? What do you mean? No, no, no, no, no
[8639.10s -> 8641.51s]  But I have otherwise I have to stay in this league
[8646.09s -> 8656.58s]  All right, I saw a great idea i'm gonna go for it. Somebody said
[8657.74s -> 8730.10s]  Nat sune miku. Where is the nat like this, right? Um, how tall was miku? That's not
[8754.87s -> 8760.39s]  Like that, right
[8760.39s -> 8816.90s]  Is that right? It's blue right miko's hair is blue. What does miko wear for clothes? Is it also blue, right? It's teal
[8818.01s -> 8823.77s]  Not even how the hell you make teal like that, right?
[8827.91s -> 8831.53s]  Like that. Oh shit. All right. Thanks for the reference mods
[8832.09s -> 8844.23s]  Okay, that's good. That's a little too
[8848.76s -> 8861.69s]  All right getting there. I mean, this is the best I can do guys. I can't I can't make that hair
[8873.83s -> 8876.31s]  Do better what this is the best I could do
[8884.15s -> 8886.63s]  Okay, this is like gray. Does it matter?
[8887.83s -> 8897.54s]  This is like okay. This is like black gray and teal
[8899.42s -> 8901.42s]  Hold on. Let me see if I can get a pattern
[8912.33s -> 8914.33s]  This is I will make this like gray
[8919.61s -> 8922.34s]  Actually, wait, hold on wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[8925.74s -> 8929.00s]  Look at this. Look at this
[8929.16s -> 8935.10s]  All right. We need to it needs to be gray up on the top
[8943.50s -> 8956.47s]  Like gray, you know what I mean? It's kind of like a light gray. Is that too gray?
[8957.11s -> 8966.70s]  I think that's all right
[8977.10s -> 8999.54s]  Don't forget she has a necktie. Oh, okay. She has a necktie. Oops. Wait, um, he's very pale
[9000.90s -> 9002.90s]  Trying to get it without it being like a
[9003.46s -> 9010.15s]  Like a bright
[9010.15s -> 9011.67s]  Yeah, that's not
[9011.67s -> 9013.67s]  That's not accurate at all
[9023.22s -> 9028.30s]  Is that better?
[9028.30s -> 9038.42s]  Maybe like 10 percent
[9038.42s -> 9044.90s]  It's hard and it's hard
[9044.90s -> 9046.90s]  I think it's too bright still
[9047.06s -> 9103.58s]  I think that's close enough. I don't know. I don't know. The shoes need to be black. Okay. Okay
[9103.98s -> 9135.82s]  I kind of like I like this one. I like this one. Which one five
[9138.00s -> 9144.07s]  seven or
[9144.07s -> 9159.42s]  Five do you think five is five? Yeah. All right. We're staying with five. Let me fix the shoes. Hold on
[9159.42s -> 9202.68s]  It's with the what color these black headphones are. Oh, that's right. All right. So
[9203.40s -> 9211.90s]  How big is miku? How tall is miku supposed to be?
[9212.54s -> 9219.67s]  She's like five feet tall
[9219.67s -> 9224.52s]  He needs okay. I had necktie. I was in necktie. All right, i'll do five i'll do five two
[9225.40s -> 9227.64s]  How tall is miku miku is five foot two
[9228.84s -> 9232.41s]  This is a wish.com miku figurine
[9240.01s -> 9243.40s]  All right, i'll just keep this here
[9243.40s -> 9248.33s]  Okay. Now we need
[9248.33s -> 9261.19s]  The music has to be accurate
[9261.19s -> 9277.62s]  It's gonna be very fast. I think this is the right one
[9283.77s -> 9302.28s]  Fast disco, okay. All right. Now, what about these?
[9304.45s -> 9306.45s]  popularity, I mean
[9307.38s -> 9310.50s]  It's I I don't I i'm pretty sure this is at least 80
[9314.95s -> 9317.45s]  No, no, no, no
[9317.45s -> 9318.89s]  I disagree
[9318.89s -> 9321.06s]  I'd say it's like I'd say it's like
[9321.68s -> 9324.60s]  82 percent or like let's say 85 percent
[9325.16s -> 9328.44s]  I mean, you know why I know this because when I opened up the hatsuit of miku across game
[9329.24s -> 9331.96s]  Um, there were like a dozen people that just said cringe
[9332.68s -> 9334.60s]  And they were mad at me
[9334.60s -> 9336.60s]  so I mean it's
[9336.84s -> 9342.88s]  It's like 90
[9342.88s -> 9345.60s]  Do a hundred strength. No, no a hundred strength
[9346.32s -> 9356.49s]  for the attitude up
[9356.49s -> 9357.87s]  75
[9357.87s -> 9359.30s]  80
[9359.30s -> 9363.34s]  75
[9363.36s -> 9366.96s]  And this is too strong 75 and everything except for popularity
[9367.60s -> 9373.26s]  Trying to be 99
[9373.26s -> 9380.11s]  No, I want it to be a challenge. We'll do 78 percent and then
[9380.83s -> 9384.28s]  72 there we go. That's better. That's better
[9384.92s -> 9387.64s]  Stop nerfing her
[9387.64s -> 9390.84s]  Hey, we're fine. I gotta fix the rest of this
[9398.84s -> 9407.63s]  This is blue too, right? I think this one's more accurate
[9443.66s -> 9446.38s]  This one it's like this one
[9448.14s -> 9451.66s]  Yeah
[9465.56s -> 9467.56s]  Is it like that
[9471.74s -> 9473.74s]  That's kind of like that
[9473.74s -> 9476.04s]  Let's go, let's go, let's go
[9480.20s -> 9485.55s]  It's like
[9485.55s -> 9490.17s]  Is that accurate?
[9490.17s -> 9496.08s]  I think so
[9496.08s -> 9508.03s]  Whatever. So now how is this?
[9508.75s -> 9510.27s]  Nat sunamiku
[9510.27s -> 9513.66s]  It's just hat sunamiku
[9526.36s -> 9528.36s]  Covered in tattoos
[9538.20s -> 9542.09s]  This is a bunch of tattoos. Oh, you need the headphones, right?
[9558.27s -> 9571.39s]  Okay
[9571.39s -> 9576.99s]  All right, I think that's good enough but this still is bob orson's stuff
[9577.95s -> 9579.71s]  Shit, hold on
[9579.71s -> 9581.71s]  It still wants us to be bob orson
[9593.23s -> 9595.23s]  Uh, whatever this time
[9615.52s -> 9616.96s]  Um, okay
[9616.96s -> 9629.69s]  Okay
[9629.69s -> 9651.16s]  All right. That's good
[9651.16s -> 9670.78s]  Heal man. Okay. Wait, I can change the promotion. Should I should I change promotion?
[9673.56s -> 9678.59s]  I'm gonna change promotion. Let's go. How about let's go right in the big leagues all american wrestling
[9684.33s -> 9696.11s]  All right. I think we're good to go. I think so
[9701.29s -> 9706.27s]  I I won in the biggest one because that's where all the look look at the stats
[9710.04s -> 9725.80s]  If nat sunamiku stats are gonna be this good then i'm gonna be in in the big leagues. All right, you can copy and paste
[9727.69s -> 9734.35s]  Wait, so does that mean?
[9734.35s -> 9741.52s]  Why am I still fighting gil?
[9741.60s -> 9743.28s]  Okay, 21
[9743.28s -> 9786.80s]  This guy I don't work for him anymore. All right, let's go. There's no match right now. Oh, that's right
[9788.19s -> 9801.34s]  There is a match right now a new phone. I gotta get out of here
[9808.76s -> 9829.13s]  Yeah, oh really give me that shovel back. You're about to hit me with it. Go find your own shovel digging over here
[9832.68s -> 9834.68s]  Go find your own shovel

[10837.11s -> 10839.75s]  This is such a weird no creative control
[10840.97s -> 10842.97s]  Wait a minute. So
[10844.54s -> 10847.34s]  They might just make me stop being me cook

[10909.21s -> 10911.45s]  Are you fell for the no creative control clause?
[10912.01s -> 10920.71s]  You're as stupid as you look

[10924.07s -> 10928.14s]  Look in the top right corner. I i have played this game
[10930.31s -> 10934.87s]  How many how many times have I screened this game 10 15 times maybe with the course for a couple of years
[10935.93s -> 10939.53s]  We've never seen a number like that before over two hundred twenty five thousand
[10940.33s -> 10942.49s]  Never happened. It's been like 30
[10944.17s -> 10946.36s]  Max

[11049.34s -> 11051.34s]  I can't fuck around. I have a match
[11089.21s -> 11106.87s]  I don't think you can do that for real, right? That's illegal
[11112.94s -> 11116.46s]  I gotta go to my match
[11119.37s -> 11120.17s]  I
[11120.17s -> 11122.17s]  I don't know why I did that. I just
[11122.57s -> 11128.06s]  I don't know. I don't know. I just didn't know what was possible. I'm not I didn't miss the show
[11131.38s -> 11132.82s]  I don't know what to say
[11132.82s -> 11139.38s]  That was fucked up
[11139.38s -> 11145.70s]  Wait, that's not a tombstone for the guy that I just killed
[11146.26s -> 11164.74s]  I'm like waited a long time for this moment and I can't wait to set about achieving my goals
[11168.65s -> 11173.37s]  Felix thinks he's the future of federation online. Perhaps i'll have to challenge for the intercontinental title
[11174.01s -> 11181.02s]  Maybe i'll form my own team and give stunner stew and roadhog something to worry about
[11181.66s -> 11188.81s]  As long as it's only a matter of time before I cross paths with comic connie for that woman's title
[11189.53s -> 11193.83s]  But of course my ultimate aim to win the universal title
[11194.86s -> 11196.86s]  You fucking piece of shit

[12012.70s -> 12020.04s]  Uh-oh, oh it's over. No way. It's over. How is it? I don't know how you still look up
[12026.12s -> 12028.12s]  Bill I swear
[12044.30s -> 12050.26s]  big move
[12050.26s -> 12052.26s]  How are you still?
[12052.82s -> 12062.42s]  Doing this
[12062.42s -> 12063.38s]  tap
[12063.38s -> 12067.46s]  It's only one a minute
[12067.54s -> 12083.13s]  just tap
[12083.13s -> 12088.09s]  Come here
[12088.09s -> 12088.97s]  go
[12088.97s -> 12090.92s]  ten
[12090.92s -> 12099.48s]  two
[12099.48s -> 12103.64s]  tap
[12103.64s -> 12106.31s]  Tap
[12106.31s -> 12108.63s]  Oh my god, give me a break
[12109.27s -> 12126.81s]  Oh, there's the tap. There it is. Finally finally have a tap
[12127.53s -> 12150.57s]  It's just a back and forth to who can break the other person's spine first
[12168.57s -> 12179.58s]  They're using furniture to block me now. Yeah, like that's gonna help. He only gave me like two seconds left
[12180.38s -> 12189.24s]  Okay
[12189.24s -> 12202.34s]  Skill, how how does the skill rise? Look at all this money, by the way, that guy's not dead
[12202.66s -> 12214.20s]  Did you see anything about that guy? That guy's not dead. That guy's alive. I need a referee tonight
[12218.54s -> 12227.16s]  Yeah, sure. There was nothing left from the body
[12231.24s -> 12234.54s]  I don't know about that
[12234.54s -> 12251.93s]  Ultra bowl versus these two. I'm gonna call it very very clean
[12255.48s -> 12285.14s]  Lady
[12285.14s -> 12287.14s]  Make it a little harder. What do you think?
[12287.30s -> 12288.82s]  Make it a little harder
[12288.82s -> 12304.25s]  Wait, I have to call wait
[12304.25s -> 12306.57s]  So if I bring a weapon in here
[12308.54s -> 12310.62s]  It's not illegal because i'm doing it, right?
[12311.50s -> 12313.34s]  so therefore I could
[12313.34s -> 12315.26s]  Drop this in the ring
[12315.26s -> 12317.18s]  And then one of them is going to pick it up and i'll throw them out of the game
[12317.66s -> 12341.08s]  It's one of these people am I supposed to be
[12341.48s -> 12344.17s]  Am I rooting for either one of these?
[12344.17s -> 12346.17s]  I just want everyone equally hurt
[12390.28s -> 12391.38s]  This guy
[12391.44s -> 12393.44s]  Interfered for one second
[12394.28s -> 12396.28s]  It was one second too long
[12400.48s -> 12405.68s]  Dude, I am kicking the shit out of this guy. This guy stands absolutely no chance
[12408.82s -> 12421.03s]  What happened?
[12421.03s -> 12424.36s]  Lady here. All right. Hopefully you learned your lesson
[12425.52s -> 12429.25s]  You come right back into the ring you stupid asshole
[12444.10s -> 12475.97s]  Oh somebody's out of the ring
[12480.47s -> 12498.47s]  Get out of here
[12498.47s -> 12500.47s]  Look at this guy regenting health
[12504.98s -> 12506.98s]  What is there a gun in the ring?
[12512.84s -> 12515.91s]  He brought a gun in here
[12515.91s -> 12517.91s]  The first person of this
[12590.18s -> 12594.26s]  He was like waving at me. Why was he waving at me?
[12597.67s -> 12598.87s]  Why?
[12598.87s -> 12600.87s]  He's like, oh, hey
[12601.11s -> 12603.11s]  I missed him twice
[12603.51s -> 12631.11s]  Where is he?
[12631.11s -> 12635.03s]  He keeps going into the ring. This is not even what is he doing?
[12637.43s -> 12639.67s]  He keeps interfering over and over again
[12640.63s -> 12643.29s]  Get out of here. Stop interfering stay out
[12644.55s -> 12664.39s]  He's gonna understand what's happening
[12667.83s -> 12676.56s]  What's happening? I don't know. I feel like this is like most pov
[12677.36s -> 12678.64s]  Don't you feel like
[12678.64s -> 12683.80s]  I feel like i'm like a rodent running around
[12684.44s -> 12689.36s]  Is this motherfucker right here?
[12689.76s -> 12698.47s]  Is this a fan?
[12698.47s -> 12700.47s]  Dude a fan got in
[12702.31s -> 12706.21s]  Why is he holding the bell?
[12707.17s -> 12715.36s]  Is anybody gonna win the match?
[12716.44s -> 12719.92s]  All right. Okay
[12719.92s -> 12721.70s]  All right
[12721.70s -> 12724.47s]  Back to it
[12724.47s -> 12726.60s]  Okay
[12726.60s -> 12729.08s]  Now cut it out. I don't want to see you back up here again
[12729.32s -> 12732.28s]  If I see you back up here again, you and I are gonna exchange words
[12739.81s -> 12742.63s]  I won't stop
[12749.01s -> 12751.01s]  He won't stop
[12757.17s -> 12759.17s]  This guy is a machine
[12759.97s -> 12761.97s]  He won't stop
[12769.68s -> 12771.68s]  He still hasn't gotten up yet
[12785.11s -> 12789.13s]  Damn it. Oh are you tapping? We got a winner
[12805.57s -> 12807.57s]  What are you doing
[12816.53s -> 12821.17s]  I'm still attacking him somehow. How am I still attacking him?
[12822.13s -> 12850.77s]  That was actually fucking insane that guy hit his head on the metal stairs
[12853.52s -> 12876.53s]  At least like at least 20 times. Oh my god. That's so fucking funny. He just kept like
[12877.09s -> 12882.85s]  He just kept falling back and smashing the ground of his head
[12883.65s -> 12908.36s]  Okay time to go to bed. All right bedtime. Geez
[12911.28s -> 12919.43s]  I didn't realize that they actually live they got run off a full speed twice by the subway train. What was that person's name?
[12928.45s -> 12934.76s]  Is this guy here?
[12934.76s -> 12936.76s]  How long has he been lying there?
[12937.51s -> 12939.51s]  It's been it's been four weeks
[12940.98s -> 12943.30s]  Was found unconscious in the subway
[12951.52s -> 12957.19s]  He was supposed to ref the match that I just repped no way
[12961.96s -> 12965.57s]  No way, that's so funny
[12976.98s -> 12983.70s]  Oh that shaky cam pov of that guy just fucking getting just the shit beat out of him
[12985.86s -> 12989.89s]  Need to finish the job
[12989.89s -> 13006.80s]  Oh, oh get up. Get up. Get up. I'm late. Oh, that was so stupid. This is the wrong way
[13014.21s -> 13029.12s]  Yep, I may be the universe champion, but we're all responsible for it. Yep. So this is the guy to beat ripper race
[13029.68s -> 13044.34s]  Forget who did that?
[13044.34s -> 13053.25s]  My mind first first
[13053.25s -> 13055.25s]  Oh shit. Okay. Hold on
[13062.36s -> 13065.72s]  Why do we perform in front of the same gormless crowd every week?
[13066.28s -> 13070.71s]  I would only give the fans a great show, but this is one place. I can't wait to leave
[13071.43s -> 13080.28s]  Let me handle the entertainment natsunamiku. These fans will go home happy after they see me kick your ass
[13081.00s -> 13095.17s]  Is this tornado tag?
[13095.17s -> 13100.12s]  Dad's tornado tag
[13100.12s -> 13102.28s]  And what's with the where's waldo guy in the back?
[13103.25s -> 13137.65s]  Found him. Oh, this is illegal. Whoops. How do I already have this half health gone out?
[13155.27s -> 13168.04s]  I have a gun in my hand. I'm reversing every grapple I do
[13171.41s -> 13179.03s]  Okay, I think this guy's on my side
[13179.59s -> 13189.57s]  Reverse another grapple again
[13190.13s -> 13211.57s]  How do you level up skill appreciate it? We're gonna get a submission right here
[13216.28s -> 13219.60s]  He's got a special move
[13219.60s -> 13221.60s]  All right, pin him pin him pin him. I'll keep this guy busy
[13222.32s -> 13247.54s]  Go for a pin. You can't just cartwheel into somebody
[13248.18s -> 13270.90s]  That was pretty sick. Can I get the cover?
[13277.60s -> 13278.96s]  Come on
[13278.96s -> 13280.96s]  Stop catching everything I do
[13282.88s -> 13302.37s]  Hmm
[13302.37s -> 13304.05s]  Another reversal
[13304.05s -> 13307.57s]  I gotta get my skill up
[13307.57s -> 13311.25s]  My skill is probably low because that's how I think I could get reversed on this character
[13312.21s -> 13315.30s]  another reversal
[13315.30s -> 13331.04s]  The skill issue that's what i'm saying
[13334.79s -> 13339.19s]  I put miku in this league. They all have like 80 plus skill
[13340.47s -> 13342.47s]  And I was trying to be
[13342.71s -> 13353.43s]  Don't look don't do that
[13353.43s -> 13355.43s]  Stop stop him from doing this
[13355.75s -> 13359.91s]  All right, he lost his bed. That's fine
[13370.42s -> 13372.42s]  Oh good good good good good good
[13373.30s -> 13382.36s]  Again another I grabbed him. That's like honestly, this is crazy
[13383.16s -> 13386.76s]  That's crazy. I think like eight out of ten moves i've done to this guy. He's reversing
[13387.32s -> 13389.17s]  I'm going to get a weapon
[13389.17s -> 13405.46s]  He reversed it again. All right, i'm done with this guy. I'm done with this guy. That's that's nine out of ten reversals
[13408.77s -> 13412.77s]  You know what?
[13412.77s -> 13443.75s]  Get out of here. Fuck you
[13453.73s -> 13455.73s]  Finally, I did a move to him
[13455.81s -> 13459.52s]  All right, protect me so I can do his submission on
[13460.48s -> 13472.13s]  This is fuck
[13493.24s -> 13497.00s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no get up get up get up. Yeah, that's good. No, that's bad
[13505.17s -> 13508.77s]  They keep reversing each other what is with this reversal shit
[13511.09s -> 13513.09s]  Get out of the way
[13520.32s -> 13521.52s]  Shit
[13521.52s -> 13523.52s]  I can barely walk
[13523.92s -> 13528.24s]  Thank god for this random guy in the suit otherwise we would have lost a long time ago
[13529.20s -> 13536.48s]  Who is it?
[13539.56s -> 13541.56s]  He's just breaking this guy's leg
[13543.24s -> 13544.52s]  uh
[13544.52s -> 13546.76s]  I don't really give a shit about that guy. So let me just rest
[13547.48s -> 13552.21s]  I don't care about that guy
[13552.45s -> 13557.00s]  He's like yoga who cares?
[13562.58s -> 13564.15s]  legs
[13564.15s -> 13578.32s]  Yeah, this guy's not even in the match and he's just still fucking around
[13579.44s -> 13581.68s]  Is anybody else?
[13581.68s -> 13584.16s]  Anybody else confused to why this is taking so long?
[13589.19s -> 13612.10s]  Why has nobody tapped?
[13612.26s -> 13614.26s]  stop
[13615.22s -> 13617.22s]  That was a quadruple reversal
[13621.62s -> 13623.62s]  Dumbass
[13625.96s -> 13630.28s]  We're going the distance again on one of these fucking things I swear to god
[13633.48s -> 13636.42s]  I swear to god
[13636.50s -> 13641.30s]  Just do somebody tap. I don't even care. It's me at this point. I seriously don't care
[13642.26s -> 13652.76s]  It's only 35 seconds
[13659.49s -> 13668.47s]  He missed
[13668.47s -> 13669.59s]  dude
[13669.59s -> 13671.59s]  This is outrageous
[13671.67s -> 13686.31s]  If we went the distance again, I don't I don't understand
[13687.35s -> 13704.76s]  I am not leaving until somebody taps out
[13715.28s -> 13719.60s]  Get over here
[13719.60s -> 13721.60s]  Reverse andy motherfucker
[13721.84s -> 13737.60s]  He's not done
[13737.60s -> 13738.64s]  tap
[13738.64s -> 13752.58s]  Got it
[13752.58s -> 13753.54s]  Good
[13753.54s -> 13758.13s]  Now let's leave
[13758.13s -> 13760.45s]  It's always right after the bell too every time
[13766.44s -> 13768.44s]  You're like kind of funny, but you're annoying
[13781.41s -> 13783.25s]  Okay, there's agility
[13783.25s -> 13790.05s]  I have more skill than this guy and it still was a problem
[13791.01s -> 13794.34s]  I gotta do some training. I'm training skills
[13805.25s -> 13813.67s]  I can't believe I have two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars. All right. Good night's sleep
[13814.23s -> 13816.88s]  No messing around
[13816.88s -> 13819.76s]  Sorry, we didn't win that match. We'll do better next time
[13820.24s -> 13821.84s]  I mean you did great
[13821.84s -> 13825.57s]  It was a 3v2. We still couldn't do it somehow. Don't ask me why
[13826.21s -> 13828.45s]  You should have been fine
[13851.03s -> 13857.75s]  Okay, slow down oh shit i'm gonna die
[13858.71s -> 13865.70s]  Zero hp need to go to the hotel
[13868.90s -> 13870.98s]  Wait, can I can just eat snacks, right?
[13871.70s -> 13877.44s]  Let me eat a bunch of snacks
[13877.44s -> 13879.44s]  Okay, how do you actually use this?
[13881.30s -> 13896.66s]  There we go
[13900.93s -> 13905.54s]  This is my food get out of here
[13906.02s -> 13910.12s]  This is my food. I bought it
[13910.52s -> 13962.21s]  All right. We're good. All right
[13962.21s -> 13965.81s]  Do I have anything going on? I feel like I've had a match every single day every single week every single day
[13966.21s -> 13970.44s]  This bit and I haven't been one week where I haven't had a match
[13971.96s -> 13978.18s]  I made more money than that
[13978.18s -> 13997.48s]  Progen forces feud with natsume miku appears to have lost momentum and is no longer over with the fans
[13997.96s -> 14000.20s]  They don't like it anymore. They think it's stupid
[14005.59s -> 14024.36s]  I'm at zero health. I can't fight right now
[14025.24s -> 14027.24s]  I cannot do a match right now
[14027.88s -> 14040.34s]  How am I supposed to do this? It's the random beer you found and drank in the subway
[14041.06s -> 14055.72s]  Can I like do anything else?
[14055.88s -> 14063.11s]  I'm scarred for life because of you now. I won't rest until you share my pain
[14067.12s -> 14069.12s]  This is the guy that got hit by the train
[14076.63s -> 14079.08s]  What did he just do to me?
[14079.08s -> 14081.88s]  You're not getting away with that. You're not getting away with that
[14082.85s -> 14084.85s]  You're not getting away with that. Get over here
[14090.40s -> 14093.60s]  Stop talking to me. I'm busy. I'm doing something
[14094.96s -> 14172.87s]  Oh you do walk through that door. How much time do I have? I have an hour to eat as much food as I can
[14184.69s -> 14198.40s]  Eat eat eat eat. I have to eat as much food as I can in an hour. Thank you. I appreciate it
[14203.80s -> 14205.80s]  These are beers. I don't want a beer
[14213.62s -> 14219.57s]  Move you gotta go. No, I don't. I'm not
[14220.93s -> 14233.97s]  Oh, what's that? You want my fucking finishing move dick? Give me water. Give me water
[14234.61s -> 14241.46s]  All right. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm good. I'm good
[14241.86s -> 14246.07s]  I'm good. I'm good
[14246.07s -> 14270.47s]  Okay, at least I have maybe some help. It's kind of not fair. I'm sick today
[14271.11s -> 14277.40s]  What kind of name is Harry Harris? Were you born with that or did you choose it?
[14278.04s -> 14283.60s]  Do you think I got where I am today with a name like that? Give yourself a chance
[14285.59s -> 14287.59s]  That looked really bad
[14287.67s -> 14291.72s]  I don't suppose it matters what your name is anyways. It's going to be history
[14297.24s -> 14303.32s]  You're right. My name is going down in history as the guy that ended the career of Natsune Miku
[14315.16s -> 14316.68s]  Nice job ref
[14316.68s -> 14334.79s]  Keep it clean. I gotta play very very cautiously
[14335.81s -> 14342.13s]  Dump him over the edge
[14342.61s -> 14347.22s]  This guy out of here
[14347.22s -> 14355.92s]  test of strength
[14363.38s -> 14374.96s]  Okay, it's gonna go a lot worse
[14375.36s -> 14382.13s]  Never mind pretty bad now
[14382.29s -> 14390.87s]  rope break, right
[14392.92s -> 14395.00s]  I'm sick too. I'm probably taking more damage because I'm sick
[14395.96s -> 14413.09s]  Couldn't lift him
[14413.09s -> 14416.29s]  Stop grappling dude when I punch they just catch my hands and kill me
[14417.01s -> 14429.46s]  I just punched me grab my arm and midair and been and broke my neck. I'm in a bad place here
[14435.17s -> 14437.89s]  Tag out. I don't think it's a tag. I think he just came to the ring with me
[14438.45s -> 14456.50s]  You know, it also doesn't help that both the characters I played with today are five feet tall
[14457.14s -> 14459.38s]  All right, relax relax relax
[14480.36s -> 14484.52s]  God that dodge
[14485.32s -> 14488.44s]  Yeah, this guy has to be six five he's six six
[14489.16s -> 14493.32s]  Move the control stick in the direction of the move opposite direction to reverse
[14494.20s -> 14496.77s]  I think i'm doing that
[14496.77s -> 14499.33s]  Like you fight this right like i'm holding in the other direction
[14499.57s -> 14503.01s]  Because if you hold it when you're doing a submission if you hold it the other way you'll like pull it back
[14503.81s -> 14516.40s]  back out I think I just lost
[14517.44s -> 14524.10s]  No, the biggest issue is
[14524.74s -> 14526.42s]  When I throw a punch
[14526.42s -> 14531.97s]  It goes like here to their face and when they throw a punch it goes over my head and around my ears
[14532.29s -> 14534.29s]  Because there's just so much bigger than me
[14540.92s -> 14542.92s]  I don't think it's not I don't think it's a tag, right?
[14550.42s -> 14552.42s]  There's no way I can beat this
[14552.90s -> 14558.92s]  Just get away from me for five seconds
[14565.17s -> 14567.17s]  I can't punch him
[14568.24s -> 14570.24s]  Oh my god
[14570.40s -> 14591.78s]  That's pretty cool
[14591.78s -> 14605.40s]  All right, give me the momentum back
[14605.40s -> 14608.05s]  Don't not in the middle of the ring, please
[14618.05s -> 14620.05s]  Harry harris
[14630.55s -> 14632.55s]  This character is so weak, too
[14633.97s -> 14637.25s]  I had I woke up this morning. I was sick. I still have to do the match
[14640.08s -> 14642.40s]  I have like t-rex level reach in front of me
[14643.12s -> 14648.37s]  Did you see that? Did you see that punch?
[14649.94s -> 14652.98s]  We both were in the exact same far away from each other he punched me I missed him
[14686.15s -> 14690.56s]  Damn it
[14690.56s -> 14693.68s]  How am I still alive? I have no idea how I haven't he's put it away yet
[14694.40s -> 14705.88s]  He's been me like three times
[14705.88s -> 14710.06s]  You've got to be fucking hitting me. That's impossible
[14726.20s -> 14730.04s]  I'm just i'm just gonna i'm gonna go into the settings and just make her eight inches taller
[14739.20s -> 14741.20s]  I'm just gonna i'm gonna make her like six feet tall
[14741.76s -> 14773.89s]  What have you done? I'm angry now. He's got instantly reversed again
[14774.53s -> 14777.09s]  I don't even have time to press me, but
[14782.18s -> 14783.22s]  I
[14783.22s -> 14790.34s]  Fuck off. He's got he's got like an entire subway sandwich length of reach on me
[14791.62s -> 14795.86s]  Do you understand he's got two meatball subs attached to the end of his hands. It's not fair
[14796.82s -> 14818.66s]  What the fuck is he doing? He reversed it
[14819.38s -> 14827.30s]  Tell you run that tape back and you tell me what happened there. I just hear my head being crushed
[14828.26s -> 14840.36s]  You need something black and white
[14840.76s -> 14846.58s]  He's gonna revert watch i'm gonna grab him. I'm surprised he didn't reverse that too. You know what?
[14846.66s -> 14869.62s]  No, i'm not done. I'm not done with you. All right, just get out
[14879.28s -> 14881.60s]  Get up somebody help me up
[14884.66s -> 14887.17s]  Oh, okay
[14887.17s -> 14889.17s]  I love him. My eye suffered for that
[14891.75s -> 14894.95s]  Harry harris is now a face and he has the support of the fans
[14897.19s -> 14900.22s]  I'm gonna beat the shit out of this guy backstage
[14900.38s -> 14910.41s]  Let's go

[15377.21s -> 15379.37s]  And tripped and hit and smashed it
[15380.74s -> 15382.74s]  So that was not even my fault
[15387.90s -> 15393.58s]  When is the funeral eating and drinking is good for an energy boost, but you'll make yourself sick
[15398.20s -> 15400.89s]  When's the funeral?
[15400.89s -> 15403.21s]  It's 7 a.m. Tomorrow. I missed it

[15470.90s -> 15475.22s]  If you could just mention the product during your next show, it could be worth twenty one hundred dollars
[15476.76s -> 15480.57s]  Oh, yeah
[15480.57s -> 15483.29s]  sure
[15483.29s -> 15486.71s]  I'll give you a wait to take to the ring. It'll be worth every penny to see you with it
[15487.59s -> 15489.88s]  Okay

[15528.39s -> 15531.48s]  standard 20 kilogram 45 pound weight
[15539.16s -> 15540.28s]  Take a look
[15540.28s -> 15548.02s]  You all should be buying this. All right. These two were a huge problem last night
[15548.74s -> 15553.78s]  I just realized the music is very loud, but whatever
[15554.66s -> 15563.46s]  Is the game loud or are we good? How loud is the is the game been really loud? Are we good?
[15563.46s -> 15570.63s]  How's the audio are we all right? Is the audio been too too hard?
[15571.43s -> 15572.63s]  This weight changed my life
[15572.63s -> 15580.28s]  I don't know where i'd be without it and you don't have to be a federation online star like me to own a weight like this
[15584.38s -> 15588.22s]  For just a few dollars. You can pick one up of your own. I suggested you so before stocks run out
[15592.22s -> 15593.90s]  You're obviously sold out
[15593.90s -> 15597.22s]  But so has this arena and they paid to see me kick your ass
[15603.66s -> 15626.15s]  Come on
[15626.15s -> 15627.51s]  I tried
[15627.51s -> 15642.86s]  I don't care if it's illegal

[15687.86s -> 15709.42s]  I got disqualified. Yeah, that's fine. I can still win. He just hit himself in the mouth
[15732.10s -> 15743.56s]  Term of violence isn't the answer. I mean, what do you what do you want to say?
[15743.64s -> 15748.94s]  I got disqualified for doing my product placement. I don't know what happened there
[15749.93s -> 15757.72s]  I climbed it and fell off. I need someone to get knocked outside so I can use my product
[15758.12s -> 15803.99s]  Oh, that's my friend. Well, this is wrong people wrong people. I'm sorry. That's my bad. Where's my weight?

[15822.57s -> 15871.32s]  Now it's a bad time for you to first person. Is he all right? What are you looking at?
[15871.64s -> 15924.31s]  Is that my guy? Yep tap what happens arm? Oh, no. No, I was like, what the hell did I do? That's one
[15925.38s -> 15926.82s]  two
[15926.82s -> 15927.78s]  Yes
[15927.78s -> 15943.85s]  Harry harris injured his back in that match. It'll be out for oh look at the glass strategic disqualification
[15943.93s -> 15962.40s]  That's kind of what happened picture. That's in amiku is upset that she was barely involved in that match
[15962.56s -> 15983.28s]  We're still number one give miku more screen time. Listen miku after what happened
[15983.44s -> 15985.68s]  I realized that none of this is worth dying for
[15986.08s -> 16012.64s]  Why don't we put all this behind us before somebody seriously gets hurt the world would be a better place without you in it
[16012.88s -> 16046.86s]  It's all right. I want to start at the title. Listen miku
[16047.18s -> 16049.90s]  I've been keeping an eye on your progress and I think some changes need to be made
[16050.14s -> 16060.38s]  You know that you've only won 43% of your matches so far this year actually really good
[16061.34s -> 16063.34s]  Get your win rate up to 48%
[16063.98s -> 16070.16s]  or i'll give you a spot to someone else just completely ignoring the
[16071.61s -> 16080.68s]  like sometimes over one to two hundred pound difference the two foot long subway sandwiches for arms and
[16082.36s -> 16088.52s]  What are you talking about? 43% is fucking unbelievable being in like five to ten weight classes lower than what I should be
[16090.67s -> 16092.67s]  All right, there's a ten man team
[16093.68s -> 16096.81s]  Where 10 v 10? What does that mean?
[16099.31s -> 16100.99s]  10 man team
[16100.99s -> 16111.16s]  This is gonna be a nightmare
[16111.16s -> 16119.47s]  Just break something. All right. Thank you free time. See you later. Remember you're on a mission to increase your win rate
[16119.79s -> 16148.92s]  I'll get it right now. I'll get it right now. All right, where do I want to go in a little bit time?
[16148.92s -> 16155.55s]  I have I could go to the toilet. I could go to the gym. Let me go to the gym
[16161.47s -> 16175.07s]  This is 10 man. Should I train do I need strength or should I just do maybe agility? This is agility, right?
[16179.21s -> 16199.71s]  That's 75 give me one more 76. There we go. All right. All right enough now i'm gonna eat some food. Okay now
[16200.78s -> 16218.68s]  Um, let's get out of here get some food. It's just water hear him at the funeral
[16220.22s -> 16229.13s]  That guy's been dead for three weeks. The funeral was like three weeks ago. I did not just do that
[16229.13s -> 16238.12s]  Did I what did I do to that guy? That guy is really hurt and I didn't do anything
[16245.40s -> 16251.20s]  I didn't do anything. You've got to be kidding me right when I was preparing for this shit
[16253.95s -> 16263.53s]  Do I have his head? Thank you. Now. Let me just eat something for a second
[16283.44s -> 16293.76s]  Okay, that's fine. That's cool. Thanks for the hug, but I've got to go. Is that good enough? That's good enough
[16293.76s -> 16301.77s]  All right, go go go go go get up
[16301.77s -> 16308.72s]  All right
[16308.72s -> 16319.95s]  I don't want to be in first person for this in no way. How are we gonna do somebody to get pinned for this?
[16327.12s -> 16333.00s]  This is impossible. This is not
[16333.56s -> 16340.09s]  possible to
[16340.09s -> 16344.73s]  Who is who? I don't know. I think it's just every single person versus themselves or
[16346.25s -> 16350.57s]  It's a how many people are in here it's 10. It's 20 people
[16361.29s -> 16363.13s]  It's a 10 man
[16363.13s -> 16365.13s]  There are more than 10 people here though
[16369.76s -> 16371.76s]  I'm just gonna hang out up here
[16374.06s -> 16376.06s]  We can actually do first person for this
[16390.49s -> 16398.88s]  What is going on?
[16398.96s -> 16410.03s]  My reach sucks
[16410.03s -> 16413.15s]  Have you guys ever heard of the movie hardcore henry?
[16414.81s -> 16420.92s]  This is a hardcore henry. This is the movie. This is the only thing you see in the whole movie
[16448.60s -> 16450.60s]  This is vr. It just is
[16456.14s -> 16467.69s]  I don't know where I am. I all right. I'm just gonna watch
[16468.41s -> 16470.59s]  Fuck this
[16470.59s -> 16473.60s]  We're watching from here
[16488.59s -> 16507.79s]  Mike that's me getting counted out
[16507.87s -> 16509.63s]  This is blood
[16509.63s -> 16513.07s]  Whose blood is this?
[16513.71s -> 16524.20s]  Oh
[16524.20s -> 16526.20s]  This is just a dream fight
[16540.40s -> 16547.96s]  Somebody said dude, can you please stop playing the game with a steering wheel? That was fucking fantastic
[16549.37s -> 16551.37s]  What a great comment
[16560.30s -> 16562.86s]  Everybody in this ring is gonna get hurt
[16564.57s -> 16566.57s]  There's no winner. There will be no victor
[16567.36s -> 16570.88s]  It's only going to be pain for everyone. No everyone's gonna get hurt
[16574.33s -> 16579.69s]  I can't wait to see the i'm telling you right now. I ain't leaving it till at least seven people are fucking in the hospital
[16580.33s -> 16582.33s]  Not leaving it till that happens
[16585.55s -> 16588.27s]  I went you broke the ladder you idiots
[16594.60s -> 16596.60s]  I can't put the ladder back together again
[16601.69s -> 16604.81s]  We're gonna all right place your bets. How many injuries do we see?
[16606.17s -> 16610.41s]  Before the match actually ends how many at the end of the match cards are we gonna see?
[16611.05s -> 16612.91s]  I'm gonna say three
[16612.91s -> 16619.64s]  Do I even care if I get disqualified by the way?
[16620.28s -> 16626.28s]  Do I actually care?
[16626.36s -> 16628.36s]  I mean do I care about this?
[16630.64s -> 16632.64s]  My win rate. That's right. You're right
[16633.64s -> 16638.28s]  All right. I'm just gonna litter things all over the ring so everyone can hit their head like hit their head on it and stuff
[16638.92s -> 16675.96s]  It's only five minutes remaining
[16675.96s -> 16680.91s]  A random pin could actually just win it like this
[16688.57s -> 16689.77s]  Don't
[16689.77s -> 16691.85s]  Oh my god, you actually won
[16696.08s -> 16699.52s]  Huge jazz won't always be the predictor. What happened?
[16702.83s -> 16704.99s]  Was what why does it say his team won?
[16712.84s -> 16715.72s]  Was huge ass even here? Oh he was
[16718.35s -> 16727.42s]  Somebody interfered
[16727.42s -> 16730.22s]  Ain't oh, but ain't ain't no one getting by
[16731.53s -> 16733.53s]  You gotta pay me 50 bucks to get by
[16739.84s -> 16760.76s]  You fucking idiot
[16760.76s -> 16766.33s]  You can climb that
[16773.20s -> 16783.95s]  I didn't know you could climb this
[16783.95s -> 16786.11s]  Oh, whatever. It wasn't enough time for anybody to get injured
[16790.40s -> 16796.00s]  Nirvana required stitches after recurring some facial damage in that match and will be nursing the wounded till next week
[16796.72s -> 16798.27s]  Okay
[16798.27s -> 16799.72s]  That was
[16799.72s -> 16802.03s]  I remember that actually
[16802.03s -> 16804.12s]  That was the
[16804.12s -> 16806.12s]  first person chair
[16807.60s -> 16809.20s]  It was one injury
[16809.20s -> 16815.63s]  Okay
[16815.63s -> 16817.63s]  Donor stews profile suffered
[16818.35s -> 16822.81s]  I didn't i'm fine
[16822.87s -> 16823.93s]  Disappointed
[16823.93s -> 16826.94s]  No, just one
[16826.94s -> 16834.49s]  All right, we're still in second. This game is insane
[16837.37s -> 16839.37s]  I still I feel like I
[16839.45s -> 16842.84s]  Feel like half the stuff I saw today
[16842.92s -> 16853.07s]  Is is already in the long-term memory which is crazy because it happened four hours ago. All right, let me heal
[16853.47s -> 16870.46s]  Would you be willing to sell that water bottle for six dollars the one that I just threw on the ground?
[16871.18s -> 16879.23s]  Yeah, it smashed into a million pieces. This water bottle will be worth every penny. I hope it is
[16879.87s -> 16881.87s]  Yeah, congratulations. There it is. It's on the ground
[16913.21s -> 16925.13s]  I don't know. I'm just trying to cause mayhem. All right, stop causing mayhem. Get out. I want that tombstone
[16925.69s -> 16959.08s]  That's the injury doing okay
[16961.45s -> 16977.05s]  Okay, harry harris has recovered from his injury. So I was not on the winning team was I okay singles versus joanna fight
[16977.45s -> 16993.02s]  All right 18
[16993.02s -> 17003.45s]  Get off of me phil
[17003.45s -> 17005.98s]  What did I puke?
[17005.98s -> 17021.07s]  I puked the bed and rolled out of bed like that was actually uncalled for and now i'm already hurt for this match
[17021.23s -> 17032.01s]  I didn't do anything. You know what? Fuck you phil. You just ruined everything you blew it big time
[17035.02s -> 17050.80s]  Yeah, now they're gonna be fucking he came in and saw yeah
[17050.80s -> 17057.34s]  I was like in bed and he just attacked me in bed and I shit and pissed the bed and now i'm hurt
[17057.90s -> 17060.38s]  Before I have to I have to get my win rate up
[17060.94s -> 17072.59s]  Please get away from me. I just
[17076.27s -> 17081.60s]  He's blocking. No, i'm done with you phil. Forget it
[17082.16s -> 17090.06s]  Now it seems to be an altercation backstage between uh phil graves and natsumiku
[17091.24s -> 17095.02s]  apparently this morning natsumiku pissed shit and puked the bed
[17095.74s -> 17098.06s]  And uh phil did not like that very much
[17098.94s -> 17100.94s]  Uh causing a little bit of a stir
[17104.33s -> 17106.33s]  Weird because they're tag team partners
[17121.45s -> 17128.62s]  Uh, oh
[17134.33s -> 17136.33s]  Is he can't be dead
[17137.05s -> 17142.33s]  Uh, oh, who's this?
[17142.33s -> 17164.49s]  You didn't see shit
[17164.49s -> 17166.49s]  I missed my match
[17166.65s -> 17181.04s]  I'm going to bed
[17181.04s -> 17183.85s]  You cannot fault me for that. I was
[17184.33s -> 17187.48s]  Attacked because for no, I don't know for no reason
[17187.48s -> 17198.72s]  There was no reason phil graves was found unconscious in the hotel and we're resting up in the hospital for the next four weeks
[17199.04s -> 17207.15s]  Okay, come on
[17207.23s -> 17228.75s]  I have to win this match. I have to win this match
[17229.39s -> 17235.55s]  All right, it's over
[17235.55s -> 17244.59s]  So we need food. I need to eat something. I got a little bit of time. I need food
[17245.82s -> 17261.18s]  I'm not gonna start anything with anybody. I have to win this match. I just no beer just water and apples
[17261.26s -> 17272.41s]  That's all I want. He's not talking to me. Thank you. Yes, it looks a little low find some to eat or drink
[17273.12s -> 17286.90s]  All right. Listen, I've had that's enough. There's no time for a nap, by the way
[17315.98s -> 17323.07s]  Why did that happen
[17323.07s -> 17333.77s]  Was it because I was I was spamming it or if you pissed yourself
[17334.41s -> 17338.89s]  Why don't you do it in the you know what? Well, you know what phil? You know what phil fuck off
[17339.45s -> 17341.37s]  You're going into the fire
[17341.37s -> 17363.39s]  You're more popular than me miku. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to tell you. Oh, wow. You peed your pants
[17364.19s -> 17368.80s]  You can't take it back. You can't take it back phil. There's no taking it back now
[17409.53s -> 17413.90s]  So put away wait, wait, can somebody explain to me what happened
[17422.33s -> 17424.81s]  What why did the vending machine do that?
[17431.48s -> 17438.51s]  Are they gonna are they gonna hold on a minute? Are they gonna hold a memorial?
[17439.15s -> 17458.34s]  For miku, that's the longest career ever. Are they gonna hold the memorial? Where was that federation, right?
[17461.97s -> 17464.53s]  Oh, no, okay
[17464.53s -> 17468.29s]  Well, there's effing gilette. Oh, yeah heck. I like god of natural causes
[17486.86s -> 17503.15s]  Nice job gil gil with the championship here. He used it too much while it was damaged. When was it? How was it damaged?
[17503.79s -> 17528.22s]  I'm playing as walti
[17540.10s -> 17551.92s]  All right, so i've had enough I know how to play. Why do you laugh like that? I mean like this
[17552.88s -> 17572.46s]  An orange for free you can keep forgetting that you if you eat while you're full i'm so whatever i'm so
[17573.62s -> 17582.80s]  Stupid he's a sesame street character. So wait a minute
[17600.67s -> 17631.95s]  Why is he stuck here? It's not happening. You're welcome. How did I do that before?
[17637.82s -> 17641.26s]  Didn't happen another stream. I'm pretty sure it's it's an intended mechanic
[17642.27s -> 17644.99s]  But wouldn't isn't it already broken? I'm just i'm gonna see how it works
[17645.47s -> 17655.26s]  Okay, so that it just exploded
[17656.86s -> 17659.98s]  It must just be random like while you're using it if you use it too much
[17660.70s -> 17667.22s]  Let's drop a bunch of like eat on the ground
[17667.86s -> 17694.06s]  All right. Somebody said we want power. I'll give you power. Stop playing old shitty wrestlers. We want power
[17695.95s -> 17696.83s]  Okay
[17696.83s -> 17744.37s]  I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. I love them already. Did you shit your pants? I think this guy shit his pants
[17744.77s -> 17750.67s]  Look out everybody. It's walti the master of the death valley driver
[17751.07s -> 17756.93s]  You seriously think that a medic move like that will work against a warrior like me?
[17757.57s -> 17764.10s]  Should be worried because when I hit the death valley driver this match is over
[17765.86s -> 17771.25s]  You're in deep shit. The match will be over when I hit you with my tombstone. Your entire career will be over
[17774.34s -> 17821.26s]  Let's see about that
[17821.26s -> 17826.61s]  No
[17826.61s -> 17836.99s]  Eat that this is a pretty good match so far
[17838.13s -> 17888.16s]  Test of strength good reversal. What's that? That's sting. It's a good first match. It should be a victory here
[17891.15s -> 17907.44s]  Oh fuck off. What's this? I don't know what walti special move is
[17908.69s -> 17913.70s]  We'll find out
[17913.70s -> 17923.09s]  Maybe not. Okay, whatever. All right. What's the special move? Let's hit it build the momentum if you talk about the way you build momentum
[17927.55s -> 17930.18s]  Ready death valley driver
[17931.34s -> 17958.50s]  They literally said it in the beginning. This is so rude
[17965.97s -> 17990.98s]  All right, this sucks. Where's miku miku? Um, i'm okay
[17999.68s -> 18009.92s]  You didn't even get hit by that. Wait, what she just blocked it for you. Wait, were you proposing that you help me?
[18011.39s -> 18040.02s]  Oh, whatever. You totally dripped down. I think looks pretty good. Stop doing old shitty wrestlers
[18042.43s -> 18044.43s]  Yeah, they're always like a squirrely guy
[18045.98s -> 18052.02s]  I don't think i've ever done anything normal. It's always a squirrely weirdo or a huge
[18052.96s -> 18054.96s]  Like seven eight foot tall
[18055.36s -> 18057.86s]  700 pounds there's never been a normal person
[18058.42s -> 18081.41s]  Okay. Uh-oh
[18081.41s -> 18123.22s]  Singles match. I can't I can't I just can't see where i'm going. I can't see where i'm going
[18123.78s -> 18127.81s]  You prescribe me some steroids
[18136.54s -> 18154.64s]  Okay, thanks for the steroids look at all this food that's still here go work out
[18168.64s -> 18188.51s]  Are you saying that because i'm old? Oh nice. That's all guys. We stayed again. Uh, I need a dumbbell. Here we go
[18195.64s -> 18225.06s]  76 i'm on steroids. I need to eat all that food on the ground like an hour. I'll be all right
[18256.66s -> 18266.66s]  Sell that burger for five dollars. Thanks for the money
[18269.41s -> 18285.63s]  All right. We're good. It's time to fight. Why'd you give him a half-eaten burger? I gave him nothing
[18285.87s -> 18300.34s]  Can we get an update on your weird pee?
[18301.65s -> 18305.09s]  Oh, you mean when I pissed on a water test strip and it said there was a shit load of iron in it
[18305.41s -> 18313.07s]  I didn't really follow up with it. How did that miss? You gotta be kidding me
[18313.71s -> 18314.99s]  That was perfect
[18314.99s -> 18326.18s]  I think you're a great wrestler greg mcmahon, but you're not even a wrestler at all
[18329.94s -> 18334.98s]  You're a glorified stunt man who can only win matches by swinging weapons and smashing through furniture
[18335.46s -> 18341.41s]  When I step into this ring it becomes a war zone. I guess that's too much for you to handle
[18346.13s -> 18351.49s]  Matches too much for you to handle because you're not civilized enough to play by my rules
[18352.13s -> 18370.11s]  It was a weird exchange, but whatever
[18370.35s -> 18382.24s]  He's kind of kicking my ass
[18382.24s -> 18384.86s]  Damn it
[18384.86s -> 18387.26s]  That move it just did 10 to 15 damage
[18389.31s -> 18400.54s]  stupid
[18400.54s -> 18414.90s]  How are you doing all this? Oh shit, it's gonna be over really quickly
[18415.46s -> 18457.82s]  I'm way out of my league here. Get off. It's got i'm way out of my league. I'm so out of my league
[18458.30s -> 18470.70s]  I can't even get up my head
[18471.10s -> 18480.14s]  He
[18480.14s -> 18486.35s]  Demolished me that was not even a contest. I got so badly beat. That was unbelievable
[18521.76s -> 18533.25s]  Bring him to the subway. I don't think we're gonna be able to see him on the subway. Forget about the subway
[18533.33s -> 18535.65s]  I need some I need some appointment
[18539.97s -> 18548.35s]  I think I have a few cuts
[18548.35s -> 18550.35s]  No new pin tweet liar
[18552.48s -> 18570.24s]  right look
[18570.24s -> 18576.86s]  76 strength 89 skill 86 agility. What is he doing here? Why is he in wrestling revolution?
[18580.02s -> 18589.47s]  This guy is way way too good to be in this league. That was ridiculous
[18595.76s -> 18597.60s]  Oh, yeah, somebody's people asking what the hell are you talking about?
[18597.60s -> 18601.36s]  So I peed on a water test strip and it said I had a bunch of lead in my piss
[18605.46s -> 18611.95s]  And I just never followed up with it
[18611.95s -> 18617.87s]  But I i'm glad greg mcmahon to teach you a lesson. You don't belong at wrestling revolution of walti
[18624.77s -> 18626.91s]  All right
[18626.91s -> 18628.91s]  I love people asking what the hell I mean
[18629.15s -> 18630.80s]  All right. So
[18630.80s -> 18634.16s]  I got water test strips to test the water to see what's in it. Like, okay
[18634.16s -> 18639.46s]  Just to see how it's doing and I was like, you know, I just for no reason
[18639.54s -> 18642.58s]  I just thought it was like kind of funny. I just I just for no reason
[18643.42s -> 18647.74s]  I wasn't like, oh i'm gonna do this. I just I I pissed on one just to see like what my piss looked like
[18648.14s -> 18659.01s]  Like what my ph and everything was because it's designed for water. It's not designed for anything else
[18659.65s -> 18661.49s]  I was like, that's kind of funny
[18661.49s -> 18664.45s]  And the only reason why i'm saying that is because they put
[18665.36s -> 18672.72s]  A hundred of these strips into one container and guess what you only need to use it once
[18675.02s -> 18678.46s]  So it's like, oh look water test strips, you know buy here's some water test strips
[18680.05s -> 18685.81s]  Why am I ever gonna need more than three of these? That's enough water test strips for 40 50 years
[18686.21s -> 18692.21s]  I was like, you know, whatever i'm just gonna pee on one. You explained that really badly
[18692.61s -> 18697.50s]  I mean, they're not designed for pee
[18703.94s -> 18715.66s]  Gil feels great today and is in perfect health. Why would you pee on one? I don't know
[18717.79s -> 18732.88s]  I put in my mind. I was like, why not? No, I didn't pee on all of them
[18738.98s -> 18742.50s]  You guys are making it sound like I took one out tested my water
[18743.06s -> 18745.94s]  And then just laid them all on the ground and pissed all over them
[18746.66s -> 18748.53s]  No
[18748.53s -> 18753.33s]  I peed on one. I didn't pee on all of them. That would be so wasteful and stupid
[18757.52s -> 18759.52s]  All right. So now let's go
[18759.60s -> 18769.30s]  It would have been way funnier if you did. I wasn't even trying to be funny
[18769.38s -> 18775.68s]  There was nobody that I was making this joke for I just felt like doing it because I just I just feel like doing this
[18776.40s -> 18780.56s]  And it's just completely just something completely benign. It's not it's just like you're just doing it because you feel like it
[18781.04s -> 18794.50s]  That's impulsive
[18794.50s -> 18796.50s]  It's really not okay
[18796.66s -> 18802.74s]  It's a it is impulsive but it's not oh my god that what impulsive behavior that's wrong what you did
[18803.46s -> 18814.24s]  It's I peed on a fucking test strip. I peed on a water test strip. Who cares? This is
[18814.88s -> 18832.98s]  It's not doing anything negative. There's nothing wrong. Why is that lead in your pee? There isn't I
[18833.70s -> 18836.98s]  It's not designed for pee. So it's gonna come up wrong
[18837.70s -> 18860.35s]  What are you somebody always does this shit? I swear to god. I'm sorry
[18860.99s -> 18870.35s]  Stop fighting me leon. We're not you and I have friends get away
[18878.75s -> 18894.82s]  Get away from me. Where's my guitar? There it is. That's what we're gonna do
[18894.82s -> 18897.70s]  We're gonna rock out when we get around to carton. That's what's gonna happen
[18938.45s -> 18940.45s]  This guy's glow in the dark
[18946.74s -> 18948.74s]  Why is this guy glow in the dark
[18948.90s -> 18976.05s]  Walty i'm sure you think you'll win this match and I certainly know that I can
[18976.29s -> 18982.62s]  Why don't you put your money where your mouth is and bet it on it?
[18984.20s -> 18986.20s]  2190 says I kick your ass
[18989.95s -> 18990.83s]  Okay
[18990.83s -> 19023.15s]  That was a lot of damage. Just do that over and over again. This is free money. You can't okay
[19023.23s -> 19031.85s]  There's a you can't hold it. You can't hold it forever. I thought you could what's wrong is this guy?
[19040.83s -> 19054.17s]  I actually really want that money. Come on. Walty sucks

[20112.96s -> 20120.06s]  It was just dumb what he did. I don't think you want to mess with me right now. This is a big mistake. I'm just saying
[20123.63s -> 20126.35s]  I mean, this is a huge mistake. Why would you even say anything?
[20128.00s -> 20130.19s]  Why would you try to attack me?
[20130.19s -> 20133.55s]  He ran behind me and ran into my shit and then said hey watch where you're going
[20133.55s -> 20140.03s]  And then now he wants to fight me
[20140.03s -> 20165.18s]  Where are you going smashing an announcer's desk?

[20386.51s -> 20396.48s]  What's wrong with me, um, it's uh, I'm not controlling the guy
[20424.59s -> 20436.51s]  Oh, that's all that's all just a little bit uncomfortable sleep. I don't think this guy can die
[20443.74s -> 20450.08s]  Tanked four trains
[20453.32s -> 20461.96s]  Can I just not die I lost control

[20543.71s -> 20546.03s]  He won a hundred percent of the matches
[20549.85s -> 20554.06s]  That took a lot though that took a lot

[20562.16s -> 20568.60s]  100 win rate
[20574.36s -> 20578.68s]  Yeah, 99 in every stat means you can get hit by the train
[20579.64s -> 20581.64s]  in consecutive days
[20581.72s -> 20593.58s]  About 10 times in a row. That's unbelievable. All right, I think i'm gonna call it for today
[20595.24s -> 20597.48s]  That was funny. This game is always funny
[20598.04s -> 20608.01s]  This game is always just ridiculous wrestling empire glad to go back to it train got us all I think right

[20623.95s -> 20628.29s]  So I want to give you guys a little insight as to what's going to be happening in 2023
[20630.22s -> 20637.92s]  I want to do more streams. We're just chilling out playing a game like I told you this last um
[20638.97s -> 20640.70s]  Late last year
[20640.70s -> 20646.89s]  But I want to bring back more just hangout streams where we just play games. I'm gonna do more of those this year
[20651.50s -> 20653.50s]  It's oh fuck it's 2023. Yeah, it is
[20656.17s -> 20662.96s]  No, not not omega gaming weekends, but just like if I just feel like playing something i'm just gonna play it then that's it
[20668.35s -> 20671.23s]  But yeah, that's wrestling empire. That's the stream good to be back
[20672.12s -> 20674.12s]  I will see you guys in a couple days on friday
[20675.18s -> 20683.71s]  Thanks for watching as always
[20683.71s -> 20688.03s]  Yeah streams will be we'll we'll stay in this early period too something that like the noon to two
[20690.88s -> 20692.24s]  You know what? I figured out
[20692.24s -> 20697.24s]  Notice how I was perfectly on time today. I got a new 2023 strategy. You ready for this?
[20698.32s -> 20699.28s]  so
[20699.28s -> 20702.96s]  The sus is always for this 2023. I'm gonna try it
[20703.60s -> 20705.60s]  Sus is always going to be set
[20706.09s -> 20709.53s]  At least an hour or two later than I actually really want to be live
[20710.67s -> 20716.67s]  So what's going to end up happening is sus will be set for like two or three o'clock pacific sometimes, right?
[20717.39s -> 20719.88s]  And here's the strat
[20719.88s -> 20721.88s]  Just whenever i'm ready, let's go
[20722.54s -> 20727.82s]  And i'll just make sure that i'm always ready before the set time and i'll make sure it's always an hour or two
[20728.22s -> 20732.96s]  later than I want to be
[20732.96s -> 20734.81s]  Lying to us
[20734.81s -> 20739.45s]  Because then it doesn't matter. I will always be on time because if it if it takes until two
[20740.01s -> 20751.36s]  Which it shouldn't but if it does i'm here you're delaying without the shame. That's right delaying without the shame
[20751.84s -> 20754.96s]  Especially when our clocks are so late
[20759.37s -> 20764.72s]  Me and holly were sitting around just laughing at what let's think let's talk about this really quickly
[20766.33s -> 20771.85s]  At what point of your clocks being slow or fast is your entire life fucked up?
[20774.40s -> 20777.28s]  Imagine operating it forward after 20 minutes
[20778.14s -> 20782.97s]  Everything is messed up. Nothing is correct. Yeah, even 15 minutes
[20783.29s -> 20790.12s]  So the fact that this dude is just sitting here operating on a 46 minute wrong clock
[20790.28s -> 20798.67s]  How how is it possible and then they maybe they had something read up that was super super meaningful
[20799.31s -> 20805.95s]  And oh guys 2023 here's to this here's to this here's and you missed it and you fucked up and you just pissed
[20806.91s -> 20812.78s]  Like fuck this holiday. I don't even care scrap the draft that I had i'm talking about me
[20818.80s -> 20825.29s]  I don't know. I thought it was funny. Why'd you write that? I don't know dude. Why did I pee on a why did I pee on a
[20825.85s -> 20837.42s]  Water test. I don't know. I thought it was funny. Yeah, I talked about the tweet from new new years and I was 46 minutes late
[20846.58s -> 20854.04s]  Anyways, i'll see you guys on friday
[20854.60s -> 20857.40s]  Uh, I don't know what we're gonna do. We'll do whatever we'll do whatever we want
[20857.80s -> 20862.01s]  There's a lot of games that have come out over the last month or two that I haven't played
[20863.23s -> 20865.23s]  Uh, so we'll get more of these more game streams
[20867.07s -> 20869.63s]  And i'll see you later. See you friday. Thanks for watching

[20924.70s -> 20935.45s]  Hey, i'm serious. By the way, there's actually an option to disable the white flashes in the great ace attorney chronicles. Are you serious?
[20936.97s -> 20947.93s]  I'll have to look into that because that's what is just put me off completely
[20948.73s -> 20957.39s]  You're gonna do more breath of the wild?
[20957.39s -> 20959.84s]  probably

[21117.98s -> 21122.40s]  It sounds like a pretty good weekend

[21182.46s -> 21183.66s]  oh
[21183.66s -> 21185.66s]  No, no, it was a present. It was a thing that
[21186.62s -> 21188.54s]  some community members helped
[21188.54s -> 21190.41s]  to like get
[21190.41s -> 21191.61s]  ready
[21191.61s -> 21195.07s]  And it's awesome
[21195.07s -> 21200.64s]  And you'll see why on friday
[21200.64s -> 21203.42s]  All right, so grotto beasts
[21203.42s -> 21205.48s]  You can expect
[21205.48s -> 21208.68s]  To see some very very major major news
[21210.62s -> 21213.18s]  on the grotto beasts release date
[21213.74s -> 21218.33s]  incredibly soon
[21218.33s -> 21220.01s]  I would say
[21220.01s -> 21223.13s]  There's going to be a major major release date reveal
[21224.01s -> 21225.61s]  and potentially
[21225.61s -> 21227.61s]  even beginning sales
[21230.12s -> 21232.12s]  Over these next two or three weeks
[21232.92s -> 21234.30s]  Okay
[21234.30s -> 21238.11s]  Okay
[21238.11s -> 21240.35s]  Okay
[21240.35s -> 21246.68s]  All right, we're trying to get it

[21248.44s -> 21250.46s]  And ready to be purchased
[21250.46s -> 21252.46s]  There's a lot of moving parts with this project. So
[21253.02s -> 21255.82s]  It's not just quite as simple as oh just release it
[21257.29s -> 21259.29s]  There are 200 cards
[21259.93s -> 21263.45s]  There's a starter kit. There are booster packs. It's a whole thing
[21264.17s -> 21270.73s]  It's gonna be wild
[21270.73s -> 21274.01s]  Release the armin video. I haven't seen that in a while
