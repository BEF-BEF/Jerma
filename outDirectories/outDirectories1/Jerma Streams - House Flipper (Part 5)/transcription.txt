[1.40s -> 15.90s]  Hey, how are you? Cool. Okay, what about the rest of you? There's a few of you that didn't say
[15.90s -> 31.46s]  anything. Okay, welcome back. Do I like... I don't even know what that is. I don't know what the
[31.46s -> 37.42s]  latest meme encyclopedia I have to look up. I don't know what that is. I'm not gonna read it.
[43.54s -> 52.74s]  Garden Flipper tonight, like yesterday. We're back at it again. This time it's a little
[52.82s -> 64.42s]  different because this time they changed over. We're on static IP and we got a new DNS server.
[64.42s -> 76.25s]  So I don't know how this one will turn out. It might not do anything. I was testing for the last
[76.97s -> 84.33s]  hour and a half or so just streaming to the test server and it was okay. It was okay.
[86.02s -> 93.22s]  I'm gonna hold my breath on this though because I'm so used to
[94.89s -> 98.81s]  the last week straight of it being all over the place. It's probably not gonna do anything
[101.11s -> 108.23s]  but I dropped like 1%, like 2% of frames when I was doing the test which is not great but
[108.23s -> 125.26s]  it's not terrible either. Am I on the sleep deprivation drug again? No, not really. Not
[125.26s -> 131.98s]  today, although I haven't been getting much sleep. I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm going
[131.98s -> 138.38s]  through like, I don't know, what's the thing you go through when you get older? Menopause, right?
[139.02s -> 160.07s]  I don't know. Maybe it's that. Manopause. No, but I'm honestly just sitting here for a few
[160.07s -> 167.46s]  minutes just to take a look and we look pretty clean. I got the green light. Green means
[167.46s -> 175.74s]  go. Red means stop. Yellow means I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Should I
[175.74s -> 198.87s]  go really fast or should I hit the fucking brakes? So, we're gonna go. We got green.
[200.07s -> 204.39s]  I scared your dog. Hey, turn me up a little bit. Turn the volume up a little.
[205.21s -> 210.01s]  I'll make it right. I'm probably on your television set. Turn me up.
[213.54s -> 219.62s]  Hey, who's that? Who's that good dog? Are you a good dog? Yes, you are. You are such a good
[219.62s -> 230.60s]  dog. Are you a good dog? Yes. Okay, you can turn me down. You can lower the volume now.
[231.08s -> 245.61s]  Let me get this on the screen. Hey, that's where we were. Your dog didn't react. That's impossible.
[247.27s -> 257.10s]  I don't believe that. Every dog reacts to that. What is W? W, W, W, W, W?
[257.82s -> 268.54s]  Why is everybody doing W? Oh, because of the ground. Right. Oh, because of the ground. Right.
[270.28s -> 279.59s]  Like I always am. Right. Okay, right. Right. So, today, I kind of want to do something
[279.59s -> 288.22s]  real quick. I just want to go look. Yesterday, we had a... I don't know. Let me go see what would...
[288.22s -> 295.72s]  I think I kind of need a clean slate here because where's the one that I already... this one,
[295.72s -> 305.96s]  right? Go to the house. House price $74,000. I've spent $6,500 on renovation and $36,000.
[305.96s -> 314.25s]  How bad is this place? We got five community subs from Tori. This is cool. No, this is
[314.25s -> 321.22s]  terrible. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need to do a little walk through here.
[322.02s -> 332.14s]  Thank you for the five community subs, Tori T. This is not... this is terrible. This is not right.
[338.55s -> 358.98s]  What was wrong with me last night? This is like what happens when you give insects drugs.
[358.98s -> 366.79s]  Wasn't there a video where they gave like a spider like crack? I am the crack spider or like
[366.79s -> 378.47s]  the the fucking cocaine spider. Jeff, thank you for the five community subs, Jeff. I made a big
[378.47s -> 388.38s]  playground. This place... all right. I don't want to do this one anymore. This is horrible.
[388.38s -> 398.34s]  I don't want to do this house. I, in fact, want to get rid of this house. I don't want this one.
[398.34s -> 406.07s]  I was on like drugs last night. I was on sleep drugs. None of this works. I hate all of this.
[406.07s -> 415.54s]  It's making me feel bad. Finish this house. Finish the oven. Oh yeah, it was supposed to
[415.54s -> 424.23s]  be an oven. Can I not do this? I don't think I want to flip this one. I want to start over.
[427.35s -> 442.15s]  This place sucks. I'm selling it. The art looks all right. Restart this house? No, no. I'll come
[442.15s -> 456.86s]  back to it. I'll come back to it. I don't like really anything about this. American Crop English
[456.86s -> 467.96s]  Modern. English. It has a free raw layout. Flower bows with blooming colorful perennials
[467.96s -> 472.84s]  and naturally shaped bushes are dominating. Yeah, this is pretty natural. Romantic corners
[472.92s -> 482.79s]  don't have any of that. What about these crops? I mean, this is pretty, there's no equipment,
[482.79s -> 490.68s]  but excellent. A lot of plants, various surfaces, cleanliness, mown grass. All right. So I got a
[490.68s -> 497.05s]  3% bump on my, on my offers. All right. I'm, I hate this place. I don't want anything to do
[497.05s -> 502.47s]  with it. No, no, no, no. I like this place. I kind of want to keep it. I keep it for now.
[502.47s -> 522.18s]  I'm not going to keep it. I want to start over and I want to do it right. Browser. I
[522.18s -> 528.58s]  got tons of money. Oh, who cares? I just bought a house, half flipped it and then
[529.46s -> 538.50s]  walked out the front door, turned around and went, who cares? Almost only a garden. Okay.
[541.94s -> 544.90s]  New house. Are you going to lose your gamer license? I'll take care of it. This is,
[544.90s -> 550.50s]  this is the one. This place is, look at this place. This place is bad. $183,000.
[556.20s -> 564.30s]  The home alone house is $400,000, guys. This is a lot of money, but there's no
[564.30s -> 576.39s]  garden in the home alone house. How do I even, isn't, this is just a regular house.
[576.39s -> 600.57s]  This doesn't need to be flipped. I hope that wasn't a mistake. I don't have any money left.
[600.57s -> 610.84s]  None of this is garden stuff. All I need to say is that a movie was filmed here
[611.40s -> 627.06s]  and the price already went up. Can I say that? Be careful. Is it trapped still? Oh,
[627.06s -> 642.28s]  I can just sell this stuff. It's not a movie, Jeremy. It's real. Well, I just wasted a
[642.28s -> 646.86s]  bunch of money. I'll probably just get it right back. This is, okay, this is going to be a real
[646.86s -> 657.58s]  flip job. Holy buckets, 800 bucks. All right. Let's start here. This is already done. This
[657.58s -> 669.70s]  house is already made. Look at the Christmas tree. This is not a house flipper. This house
[669.70s -> 683.38s]  was flipped before I got here. Maybe a fuse is blown. I'm just like, I'm just cleaning up
[683.38s -> 692.20s]  this way. I have to do that with every single one of these. Yeah, the fuse is probably
[692.20s -> 703.90s]  in the garage. I'll take care of it. Just hold on. I'm busy. I think I'm replacing LEDs with
[705.10s -> 727.40s]  like the internal mechanical lights. Why would you replace LEDs? Watch out. Nothing's going to
[727.40s -> 740.92s]  happen. There's no traps. Nothing's going to happen. Oh, look out. A paint can just hit
[740.92s -> 758.22s]  me right in the fucking mouth. Yeah, this is, it can be, it's not dirty. So much trash here.
[758.22s -> 765.86s]  No, this is not. This is what you think trash looks like. You need to come to my house.
[767.14s -> 788.50s]  I mean, whoa, whoa, it's a lot dirty. No, I'm actually pretty clean. I'm a pretty clean
[788.50s -> 805.40s]  individual. There's three people living here. Yeah, we've got our own domains. So, okay,
[805.40s -> 809.72s]  somebody tell me, give me the TLDR here. Was there a reason for me to purchase this house?
[809.72s -> 816.66s]  Are you guys waiting for like the oil to be on the ground and for me to slip and break
[816.66s -> 825.50s]  my neck? Is that what's going on? I don't think you're going to get it. I'm fairly certain that
[825.50s -> 836.06s]  you're not going to get it. I open up this one and it's just crossbow shoots down the hall
[836.06s -> 849.62s]  right by my face. Now, this is done. That looks fine. Yeah, I think it's clean. This
[849.62s -> 860.36s]  house is clean. How do you flip a house that's already done? Maybe a fuse is blown. Yeah,
[860.36s -> 866.36s]  I'm going to go look for that. Hold on. There's like trash over here. What's behind the
[866.36s -> 877.00s]  tree? Oh, just glass. All right, let's go turn it all on. There's probably a fuse blown.
[881.32s -> 903.94s]  Probably. Press E. All right, stick it back in. E. E. Can you play the piano? All right,
[903.94s -> 907.98s]  so that's fine. Everything's good. Just have to turn the fuse on. And then is it going to
[907.98s -> 918.78s]  turn into like a clown show in here? What is all this? Oh, what? Isn't there a basement
[918.78s -> 934.50s]  in this movie? Kitchen. The knife. Anything with the knives? Nothing. Pizza. It's just a
[934.50s -> 949.45s]  little bit of trash. Not a big deal at all. This ain't a big deal. It's a viscera cleanup
[949.45s -> 956.62s]  detail. It is like viscera. There's only one difference. You can plant trees and you can buy
[956.62s -> 965.86s]  furniture. It's very similar, but also different at the same time. All right,
[965.86s -> 969.70s]  dispose, dispose, dispose, dispose, dispose. Everything's clean out here.
[970.42s -> 979.21s]  Is this snow? All right, well, I gotta go down. This is the garage, right?
[982.78s -> 991.75s]  Destroy this house. Let me just get to the gotcha moment. There will be a gotcha here,
[991.75s -> 999.08s]  and everyone will scream. Let's find it. Here's the fuse box. All right, hold on.
[1000.36s -> 1004.86s]  It was possible that something was going to run down the stairs at me.
[1005.42s -> 1014.12s]  One's broken. This one's nice and fixed. Turn it on. All right, now we have power.
[1016.47s -> 1036.44s]  Ooh, wait a minute. What? Dead? No, very much alive. Why? Why do I have this in the house?
[1037.24s -> 1051.46s]  All right, let's turn on the Christmas tree so everyone can laugh. All right. Can I have my
[1051.46s -> 1055.86s]  money back? I want a refund on the house. Can you do that? Can you do a refund if you buy a
[1055.86s -> 1068.38s]  house? You got 30 days to see if you wanted it or not. Yeah, I'd like to return a house,
[1068.38s -> 1078.14s]  please. Reason for the return? Uh, I just, no, I'm not feeling it. You guys have like that,
[1078.14s -> 1085.45s]  like 30-day policy, so I'll just, I'll try another one. Imagine getting a free trial house.
[1086.09s -> 1089.91s]  You get 30 days. Why don't they treat houses like they treat mattresses?
[1090.55s -> 1097.85s]  You know, you can sleep on a mattress for fucking like three months, and then you just,
[1097.85s -> 1108.74s]  if you don't want it anymore, you send it back. All right, let's see. What am I,
[1108.74s -> 1113.64s]  can I please at least get, I just cleaned it up a little. Nobody does that. No,
[1113.64s -> 1117.08s]  I know nobody does that, but like look at all every mattress you could ever purchase.
[1122.06s -> 1126.30s]  They do like 180 days, like 200 days, some of them. Some of them do a year. Why?
[1127.02s -> 1143.86s]  The Smoothe family. All right, I made a profit. $66,000 profit. Positive options,
[1143.86s -> 1155.51s]  negative options, okay. Uh, I'm gonna accept, let's negotiate. I mean, come on,
[1155.51s -> 1169.19s]  this movie, this was made, this was used in a movie. 30,000? More? What do you mean
[1169.19s -> 1180.47s]  increase? That's no, just $30,000 is enough. Why is everybody saying increase, increase,
[1180.47s -> 1198.12s]  increase? They're gonna, all right, you guys are right. Okay, sure, I will take the
[1198.20s -> 1220.41s]  extra $49,000. Literally scammed those people. Yes, 500,000 and still living here. I get 600
[1220.41s -> 1228.57s]  grand. Yeah, I, I, I pretend I'm one of those people that I, I'm like the guy down the street
[1228.57s -> 1233.50s]  that doesn't ever buy anything but he just sees a secret millionaire. Didn't they like
[1233.50s -> 1237.98s]  a do a show about like this, the millionaire, like millionaires in the shadows, whatever
[1237.98s -> 1241.42s]  it was called, or like the secret life of the millionaire. They've done it before.
[1244.57s -> 1250.86s]  You should have re-booby-trapped that house. All right, now let's go for real.
[1250.86s -> 1255.18s]  That was just a teaser for you and that was a teaser for the internet being actually fine.
[1255.18s -> 1261.77s]  Well, all right, I'm not gonna hold my breath. We got this piece of crap but I don't want to
[1261.77s -> 1274.98s]  do that one. This is, here's the big one. This is the big one. The pizza oven house is,
[1274.98s -> 1282.76s]  I'm just, I'm sorry, that's just gonna have to sit on the shelf. That thing sucks. I had
[1282.76s -> 1292.33s]  no vision there. I was just like drunk. I was just sleep drunk. At least sell it. I will. I'm
[1292.33s -> 1307.85s]  gonna clean it up but this is the big one here. Do the nuclear house. He didn't read the asshole
[1307.85s -> 1312.41s]  part. What? Yeah, because I, what do you mean? What are you talking about? I'm gonna do this
[1312.41s -> 1315.77s]  one. Does this, we got, we got garden flipper. I'm gonna make a good garden. I'm gonna make
[1315.77s -> 1322.60s]  an actual really nice one. A large house with a separate garage for two cars in raw condition.
[1322.60s -> 1330.31s]  I will sell it right away. Two floors. This is a big one. I'm going for it. I just made some,
[1330.31s -> 1333.27s]  I just made this. Let's see how bad this is.
[1351.14s -> 1358.55s]  Oh my god. Imagine living across the street to this.
[1358.55s -> 1365.10s]  You know, we were really thinking about selling it in a year or two but uh,
[1366.63s -> 1380.95s]  our property value. Can you at least get rid of the fucking bricks? This house is,
[1380.95s -> 1389.22s]  probably shows up on those top 10 scary lists. Top 10 scariest abandoned buildings.
[1389.22s -> 1395.75s]  Top 5 scariest things caught on camera in abandoned houses. Eventually those people are
[1395.75s -> 1398.87s]  gonna, you know, here's what you understand. You know those people are gonna run out of
[1398.87s -> 1404.60s]  shit to make lists of, right? Eventually they're gonna have to start listing very boring things.
[1407.53s -> 1428.47s]  Top 5 types of wood to build a bird house. Here's the top 10 cities in a one mile radius
[1428.47s -> 1442.81s]  of London. Top 10 towns within five miles of Boston. They'll have to come up with some weird
[1442.81s -> 1456.25s]  shit, man. How do I get rid of them? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?
[1459.32s -> 1471.48s]  How do you get rid of the mole? Dude, I did like, I just tried to like spade side down,
[1471.48s -> 1478.17s]  like shovel vertical on his head. Oh my god, that would have been horrendous.
[1478.73s -> 1496.92s]  Why is the mole so big? I don't know. Well fed. You got plenty of trash around here.
[1497.64s -> 1502.81s]  Plenty of ways for him to grow. Do I need to find him again?
[1503.45s -> 1511.82s]  What's the garage look like? I have to get a vision here. This place is huge. This is a
[1511.82s -> 1531.61s]  ridiculously large project. See you guys in nine hours. This is so big. I really do want like
[1531.61s -> 1534.89s]  screenshots though because I'm gonna put time into this. I'm gonna make this real. You ready?
[1535.53s -> 1550.89s]  Keep that in your memory. This is gonna be nice over here. Keep this part in memory too.
[1550.89s -> 1562.58s]  This is gonna be a nice long path. I want to start, should we go inside out or outside
[1562.58s -> 1573.85s]  in? I feel like you need to go, I don't know. Where do you even start here? You have to just
[1573.85s -> 1578.46s]  pick a corner and just start there. All right, we'll start with a dumpster. We'll start with
[1578.46s -> 1584.81s]  this corner first and I'm gonna get this corner to the way that I like it. I'm gonna
[1584.81s -> 1595.26s]  do a nice little garden here in the corner right here. We're gonna do like reds, purples,
[1602.65s -> 1610.57s]  weeds. I have the weed wacker too. Where is it right here? We're gonna get some nice grass. I'm
[1610.57s -> 1614.17s]  not gonna fuck around on this one. We do have a tree here though which ruins everything.
[1614.97s -> 1625.99s]  I have to put down new grass. Can you add water features? I'm not actually not sure.
[1625.99s -> 1636.94s]  That's a good question. Okay, let's get this out of here. Move it all. I'm gonna, I got a
[1636.94s -> 1648.46s]  vision. I don't want to turn around either because the second I turn around it's all,
[1648.46s -> 1651.90s]  it's all bets are off because it's like looking down when you're at a really high height.
[1655.62s -> 1668.68s]  I'll fall off. I'm just going for this quadrant right here first. He's sputter walking again.
[1668.68s -> 1673.19s]  It's gonna happen, okay? It's, that's just gonna happen. All right, don't bite off more
[1673.19s -> 1683.50s]  than you can chew. Just easily, easy, easy, easy. Go back here. I'm not supposed to turn around.
[1694.34s -> 1697.78s]  All right, that looks all right. Just this side. Well, I gotta lay, we'll lay the grass down.
[1697.78s -> 1713.48s]  I'll measure it. I'll get the tape measure. Sputter walking champion. Hey, I'm, I, I'm
[1713.48s -> 1718.04s]  gonna look. I got, I'm doing my garden the way that I want to do my garden. You want to do
[1718.04s -> 1723.40s]  your garden the way you want to do your garden? Get some tools and get out here.
[1723.40s -> 1738.46s]  All right, I'm almost ready to start this section. New gardener skill. Thank God.
[1739.26s -> 1748.04s]  I can't, should I not even press this? Is the text coming soon or is the tool coming
[1748.04s -> 1759.58s]  soon? I, why would it be? I don't know. Visible moles. 100% faster unfolding grass.
[1759.58s -> 1778.92s]  That's a big one. I'm doing this one. You're gardening like my grandma. I can't name you
[1779.00s -> 1799.51s]  anybody else that gardens. I, I just, all the gardeners that I know are over 50 that like plant
[1799.51s -> 1808.63s]  plants and garden. They're all like 55. I don't know anybody personally that gardens. My
[1808.63s -> 1816.47s]  grandmother used to garden. My mother gardens. A neighbor I had before was a gardener like
[1816.47s -> 1819.83s]  really into it. Not like a, wait a second, hold on, there's a difference between like a
[1819.83s -> 1836.50s]  professional gardener and like you go outside and you plant plants and stuff. We're talking
[1836.50s -> 1840.90s]  like hobby gardening or we're talking like you pay me a thousand dollars and I make your outside
[1840.90s -> 1849.19s]  of your house look nice. Like a professional gardener. Oh, there's plenty of them. Yeah.
[1860.20s -> 1863.48s]  When did I say that hobby gardening was invalid? I didn't, I didn't say that.
[1864.78s -> 1870.62s]  I said the gardeners that like the gardeners that I know are all older like my mother and
[1870.62s -> 1879.22s]  her friends and stuff. When did I immediately follow that up going they're invalid? What?
[1889.59s -> 1905.34s]  You should know more gardeners. I'm sorry. I don't know very many gardeners. I'm not supposed to
[1905.34s -> 1917.54s]  be over here. I'm not supposed to be over there yet. Dumb streamer doesn't even know 10
[1917.54s -> 1925.62s]  gardeners. I don't think I know 10 of anything. I don't know 10 plumbers. I don't know 10
[1925.62s -> 1937.21s]  firefighters. I don't know 10 gardeners. I know 10 like different people that do different
[1937.21s -> 1949.32s]  things. I don't think I know 10 people that do the same thing. Is there more than just this one?
[1949.32s -> 1969.42s]  Let's see. Rug grass. Big turf roll. Let's get this right. Top 10. Top 10 workers.
[1970.38s -> 1977.27s]  This is going to screw me over here though. The tree being in the way. I think start here
[1977.27s -> 1984.76s]  go out. I can patch that one up. I'm just going to get it to here. This is going to
[1985.32s -> 1997.70s]  line here for now. This corner. Yeah I can't name you 10 of any profession that I know.
[1998.34s -> 2013.13s]  Okay that's all good. Or any hobby or whatever. Streamers that I know. That I like personally
[2013.13s -> 2031.08s]  know them. Maybe like six? I don't know. I think you guys are severely overestimating
[2031.08s -> 2040.25s]  the amount of people that you may know that do a certain thing. That's as close as I can
[2040.25s -> 2052.14s]  get it. Let me just make sure this is going to work. You can't lay turf on this surface. Why
[2052.14s -> 2069.90s]  not? Is it because this grass has to be cut first? That can't be why right? Can I really
[2069.90s -> 2085.93s]  not lay it here? Can't lay turf on this surface. Wait what the? Okay that was weird.
[2086.65s -> 2102.58s]  Oh there's a fork on the ground. Let's see if this rolls out. How fast it goes.
[2104.65s -> 2116.22s]  Come on. Come on. Why? Like that's perfect. That roll's not even there. I'm not enjoying
[2116.22s -> 2119.50s]  the hitboxes on these because you're always going to have fucked up lines.
[2120.97s -> 2129.50s]  Always. I can't ever put something here. Never. All right I got the hammer out out of
[2131.38s -> 2143.50s]  accident. Like I can put it here. This is going to look so shitty now.
[2147.77s -> 2157.35s]  So apparently it can't go here. It can only go here. So I'm going to line it up. Can't go
[2157.35s -> 2169.78s]  there. It can go here. All right. Right there. Right here. Let's see if that fixes it. Yeah.
[2170.34s -> 2188.65s]  That's kind of annoying. Yeah because I will forever have this. I can never lay any grass
[2188.65s -> 2203.86s]  there. It's ruined. It's beyond repair. Yeah I know. Look this is not going to be grass.
[2204.86s -> 2209.86s]  But I mean look. I can. This is going to be grass. This is going to be grass. That's
[2209.86s -> 2229.46s]  going to be. I mean I'm trying to save my rolls here. That should overlap enough to give me
[2230.10s -> 2249.45s]  no line. Just knock the fence down. If you could. You can't. Receding. Receding grass line.
[2259.19s -> 2280.30s]  I might as well move this trash out of the way. Cut. Nice and clean. All right we're making
[2280.30s -> 2291.53s]  progress. Can I stop the night cycle? I only want it to be day. Day and night mode. Real time.
[2291.53s -> 2299.40s]  What time is it? It's going to be like this forever. All right. Real time. Oh wait. Was
[2299.40s -> 2311.35s]  there another one? What was the other one? Game time. Disabled. Got it. All right. This
[2311.35s -> 2315.43s]  is good. I want to work out in the garden. I don't want to go through day and night cycles.
[2315.43s -> 2325.27s]  These are to see my immersion. No one's going to be out here at four o'clock in the morning
[2325.27s -> 2331.88s]  doing gardening stuff. All right. Yeah. And oh. Jeremy makes another generalization about the
[2331.88s -> 2343.85s]  gardeners. Apparently according to Jeremy they're all old ladies and they only work in the day.
[2347.34s -> 2354.28s]  He's a monster. Did you hear what he said? But that's not what I said.
[2354.28s -> 2374.71s]  All right. Look at it. Look. Look how much better this is looking than last time.
[2374.71s -> 2381.00s]  Now here's the problem here. This is going to be an issue. All right. Hold on. Let me line
[2381.00s -> 2400.71s]  it up. Line it up. Line it up. All right. No. No. No. No. Which one was it? This one.
[2400.71s -> 2415.02s]  It's like moving around. Stop moving around. No. What am I fucking bumping into? Oh my god.
[2415.02s -> 2433.64s]  Yeah. This is causing collision. You would just stomp on this. Anybody want a glass of wine?
[2433.64s -> 2451.85s]  What do you think? Anyone want some wine? Why are you doing that? Look at. Look at.
[2451.85s -> 2456.95s]  What am I bumping into? All right. I'm just putting it down. Fuck it. I'm putting it down.
[2462.25s -> 2476.06s]  Gardening is a dumb. I'm just kidding. I just went off on gardeners.
[2476.06s -> 2491.70s]  I don't like gardening. I don't like it at all. I think it's stupid. It looks nice.
[2491.70s -> 2497.03s]  No, I will tell you, you know, gardening takes a considerable amount of skill.
[2498.63s -> 2503.26s]  It's one reason why I know this. I used to help my grandmother do it.
[2503.26s -> 2508.09s]  Oh, there he goes again. I used to help my grandmother do it. And I would be trying to
[2508.09s -> 2517.08s]  even just something as simple as planting, like actually getting the soil ready and then
[2517.56s -> 2521.96s]  it's hard to do that. It has to be the right consistency. It has to really hold it up.
[2521.96s -> 2531.26s]  It's going to be because you can really make it look like crap. Let's get this here.
[2531.90s -> 2541.02s]  I don't know how it would. No, I'm just going to do them one at a time. That was a nice story.
[2544.78s -> 2551.26s]  Nice story. Yeah. Let me tell you something, guys. Gardening is difficult to do. And here's
[2551.26s -> 2556.89s]  why. The soil, you know, you've got to get it in the. So you got to get it. It could
[2557.77s -> 2583.91s]  fall over in the soil. That's it. That's the whole story. All right. Just again, don't look
[2583.91s -> 2591.02s]  behind me. I mean, you can, but I don't want anyone else to. This is going to go straight
[2591.02s -> 2603.78s]  up all the way behind me. Don't look behind you in this game. I don't know what's going on
[2603.78s -> 2609.40s]  in your real life, but in the video game, we're trying to keep a positive attitude towards
[2609.40s -> 2623.69s]  our house. No lines. I've gotten pretty good at that. So what the hell? Why couldn't I do
[2623.69s -> 2638.57s]  this yesterday? I was like freaking out yesterday. Using the big roll. Yeah, because I got a big
[2638.57s -> 2651.78s]  roll. You know how many stacks I got? I got like hundreds rolled up here. I have so many
[2651.78s -> 2660.38s]  hundreds rolled up like this and I'm bringing to the bank and rubber bands that they get to
[2660.38s -> 2671.77s]  get like two managers over to help. OK, let's not get to Orphezelis over here. Oh, yeah.
[2674.54s -> 2685.88s]  You're flaunting your money. No, I don't think so. How do you get it? I got to deposit it
[2685.88s -> 2713.26s]  somehow. My Chad aura is growing. Damn, you're still rolling grass from yesterday.
[2714.76s -> 2726.18s]  Yeah, it takes a long time. I haven't gone to sleep. Let's just get it like this.
[2732.23s -> 2740.92s]  Make it nice and clean. Great. No, that's going to get blocked. That is not going to get
[2740.92s -> 2752.06s]  blocked. Use those surgery FPS hands. There you go. I've got one more little slab here.
[2752.06s -> 2760.10s]  What's going on here? Is there a line? What is this? There's a line here. What's this line?
[2770.42s -> 2774.10s]  Did I tell you guys that I'm really into sardines lately? I don't think we had that
[2774.10s -> 2792.17s]  conversation. Yeah, I'm really into it. Now we can get a little roll here. A small,
[2792.17s -> 2798.04s]  little small one. I just want to get this line. Is that going to get the whole line?
[2805.13s -> 2826.81s]  Is that getting it? No. What is this line? This is pissing me off. What's going on here?
[2826.89s -> 2849.90s]  Oh, oh, what is this? Oh, no. Is it? It's a shadow. No, like clearly look in there. You
[2849.90s -> 2862.97s]  can see the ground. Like right here. That's it. That's clearly grass. That's not a shadow.
[2865.13s -> 2880.95s]  That's not a shadow. There's a bump here. That's not a shadow. Look at right there.
[2880.95s -> 2886.09s]  And it was, oh yeah, sardines. They're pretty good. And I've been, I've been mashing them
[2886.09s -> 2897.48s]  up and then put it on toast. It's pretty damn good. Really good for you too. No,
[2897.48s -> 2906.78s]  it's not a shadow. Get this off. Disgusting. Why not just buy tuna? Cause
[2908.73s -> 2915.51s]  sardines have more selenium and they're also not a predatory fish. So they don't have as much
[2916.07s -> 2941.61s]  mercury. Welcome to the school of German. I thought you made that up. No. Welcome to
[2941.61s -> 2946.33s]  gardening school. First things first. Welcome to gardening school. Put your tools away.
[2946.33s -> 2952.78s]  Everybody put your fucking tools away. Who ate sardines this morning? Raise your hands.
[2952.78s -> 2957.58s]  None of you? None of you? How old are you guys? Everybody in the room is over 55.
[2959.40s -> 2965.46s]  Grandma Tilly, what did you have for breakfast this morning? Well, before I planted my
[2967.46s -> 2990.62s]  macadamias, I had a small two egg. Wrong. Wrong. I want all of you to go home and
[2990.62s -> 2996.73s]  I want you to eat sardines for breakfast tomorrow. All of you. What is it? What is
[2996.73s -> 3013.91s]  it Edna? I'm allergic to sardines. Do it anyways. Oh. Later that evening,
[3013.91s -> 3021.43s]  German 985 was arrested for having a fake gardener's license and yelling at old people
[3021.43s -> 3036.41s]  to eat things that they are allergic to. That was the P.T.? No, that wasn't P.T.
[3036.41s -> 3046.89s]  That's not a shadow. Look at that. Oh, that's a shadow. Bullshit. Give me a break.
[3046.89s -> 3061.00s]  German, you're dumb. It's a shadow. That's not a shadow. That's like bird feathers. Zoom
[3061.00s -> 3069.59s]  in on that. This is a shadow. I can see this clearly. These are like bird feathers.
[3069.59s -> 3100.34s]  It's all right. It looks fine. We use green carpet on the lines. I think we're almost done.
[3100.34s -> 3110.66s]  This is starting to look a little better. This is where I got all messed up yesterday.
[3111.78s -> 3122.79s]  Yesterday, I was just going like this. Um, what do I dig over here? What should I do back
[3122.79s -> 3128.28s]  here to the plant? No. So what's your vision? Where's the purple? Just hold on.
[3129.08s -> 3133.70s]  I have it all up here and I'm going to do it slow. We're going to be here for the next like
[3133.70s -> 3159.30s]  six to 12 hours. I'm going to go eat some sardines, marathon gardening, get to water
[3159.30s -> 3168.87s]  the grass. Probably not. All right. So let me, this is what my, this is my vision here.
[3169.90s -> 3176.49s]  My vision is to have, I think I want, don't do anything yet. I need to like, I need to
[3176.49s -> 3183.21s]  like block it out. I don't like these trees being in the way. I'm thinking they like
[3183.21s -> 3203.38s]  descending. Can I build surfaces? Can I like go up? Can I build like up paving slabs?
[3210.92s -> 3222.28s]  Do mini golf. No. Have a mini golf course. What a dumb house. What a stupid house.
[3223.75s -> 3229.72s]  You're the guy with the mini golf course in his house. Should there be a mini golf
[3229.72s -> 3233.72s]  in the house too? Should that just be one? No, you don't. This is what happened last time.
[3234.36s -> 3239.32s]  Last time I was doing this, it was like, oh, what about like a pizza oven? Yeah. Pizza oven.
[3239.32s -> 3258.70s]  Let's make the whole house a pizza oven. Let me fix this. Can we get, all right, but hold on.
[3258.70s -> 3263.82s]  Can we get like the book ending and like the show ending? Can I do like the, can I do like
[3263.82s -> 3276.42s]  the books first? I want, I want to do like a garden over here. They're going to be like
[3276.42s -> 3282.81s]  two. You're going to see like, can we do like a full metal alchemist here? There'll be
[3282.81s -> 3295.42s]  two shows. All right. Everyone's getting in my head. Don't let them get in your head.
[3295.82s -> 3315.67s]  Don't let them get in there. I'm in. I'm in. Let's start with this. Let's do,
[3316.79s -> 3326.89s]  let's get some concrete here. Let's take a look. Stair. Oh, let me just take a look. I need to
[3326.89s -> 3345.10s]  see how this works. Oh, dumb. Hold on. So I can, can I actually do it? All right. I want
[3345.10s -> 3355.86s]  to have like a, okay. So I can, that'll be for like another like mini golf hole. I can't
[3355.86s -> 3367.67s]  fucking believe I'm doing this. I don't know if I can go that high. Okay. Well,
[3367.67s -> 3381.61s]  let's have a staircase to build up into our neighbor's yard. What could this person possibly
[3381.61s -> 3414.71s]  be doing? I should put a hole in the wall over here. Oh, shit. Shit. Shit. Hold on. Hey,
[3414.71s -> 3429.83s]  Bob. What are you doing over there? What are you up to over there? Oh, nothing. Oh,
[3429.83s -> 3469.14s]  that's as far as it goes. It's not. I don't think I could, I actually, can you, why is that I have
[3469.14s -> 3499.70s]  to, how am I ever going to delete all this? The game is starting to not like what I'm doing
[3499.70s -> 3533.54s]  right now. See, it's really not liking this. Oh God. I think I'm getting into the skybox.
[3533.54s -> 3562.89s]  Hey Bob. Hey, what are you doing up there, Ted? Oh, you know, just trying to reach God.
[3562.89s -> 3571.46s]  That's all. Got a thing or two to say to him. Hey, why you have to see if you can get
[3571.46s -> 3593.32s]  tomorrow's lottery numbers. Okay, Bob. I can't, I can't go anymore. I'm not allowed. I'm at the
[3593.32s -> 3605.45s]  box. Should I just make Jenga? I cannot leave this inside. Leave what inside? No, I wait,
[3605.45s -> 3615.29s]  I think it thinks I'm in the house. Wait a minute. We got a new plan. Yeah, it thinks
[3615.29s -> 3636.55s]  I'm inside the house. So we have to go this way. Where's it hit? Right here. Okay. Ow.
[3636.55s -> 3664.46s]  Oh, what have I done? Am I standing on anything? Hey, it's art. Yeah, because see,
[3664.78s -> 3669.90s]  I gotta like change that so it's not going in the house. So much for the nice garden somebody
[3669.90s -> 3676.63s]  said. What you meant to say was the garden's gonna be up here. I'm making another house up
[3676.63s -> 3696.94s]  here. See, this is the front. There's gonna be a beautiful house up here. God damn it.
[3696.94s -> 3713.75s]  I'm just telling it. It's whatever. No, I need those. I need these. I need these. I need
[3713.75s -> 3760.47s]  this to get up there. Thank God. I can, oh, I want to see if this works. Just breaking
[3760.47s -> 3798.78s]  kind of every law. This is so dumb. Uh, hey, Bob, what is it, Ted? You got a rope?
[3798.78s -> 3815.50s]  Let's try and jump. No, fuck. Oh, I hate it. I can't, it can't be there. It can't be there.
[3815.50s -> 3848.10s]  It can't be there. I can't leave that. It's gonna fucking drive me crazy. All right. Now,
[3848.10s -> 3853.64s]  how do I get rid of this one? I can't go straight up because I have to jump over here.
[3855.34s -> 3862.63s]  I gotta delete this. Oh God. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I think I can make it. All
[3862.63s -> 3870.09s]  right. So here's the plan. Shit. Oh, that's not good. I gotta, I gotta go up higher than this.
[3870.09s -> 3879.85s]  Wait, wait, hold on. This is not, I don't want to fuck this whole thing up. Just hold on.
[3879.85s -> 3920.82s]  Relax everybody. This will just take a second. God, fuck, no. I, I have to restart this
[3920.82s -> 3924.50s]  fucking whole thing. Is there any way it's, oh, there has to be a way I can delete this.
[3924.50s -> 3929.91s]  Why did I fucking do this? I can't reset it. No, no, no. I can do it. Oh, just get me
[3929.91s -> 3936.62s]  up there slow. I'm trying to go too fast. Am I bumping into something? I'm making like
[3936.62s -> 3943.75s]  these giant towers just to delete somebody. I saw one person said leave one and just fucked
[3943.75s -> 3954.52s]  up the whole thing. I can do it. I can do this. Just wait. I can do it. I'm just going to
[3954.52s -> 3966.82s]  start going this way now, make it clean so I can get rid of it. Okay. How far until
[3970.62s -> 3973.90s]  there's going to have to be a part two to that. I just wanted to make a garden
[3974.86s -> 3979.26s]  and somebody had to say mini golf and then like my like fucking clown meter went to a thousand.
[3979.90s -> 4013.59s]  I was doing fine. Okay. My money. Oh, no, not my money. Can I reach it? Oh, I'm not falling
[4013.59s -> 4030.36s]  again. If I fall again, I will have, I will reset it. I would have to. Okay. Slow. Thank
[4030.36s -> 4041.24s]  God. I have to think this through. Think it through. I've got to go up, but then how
[4041.24s -> 4058.04s]  do I delete these? Um, I, I think, hold on. Can I, that's not true. Can you, can I actually
[4058.04s -> 4063.90s]  do that? I'm afraid to do that. Hold on. Let me get back to where I was. I'm going
[4063.90s -> 4075.69s]  to get rid of this one. I can't reach that. Fuck. I don't, I have to delete this first.
[4075.69s -> 4081.22s]  I've got to one at a time, one thing at a time. Okay, hold on. So you, what you tell
[4081.22s -> 4086.71s]  me you, uh, here come, might be a loud noise, loud noise, potentially incoming,
[4086.71s -> 4093.93s]  turn your volume down. Nope. Doesn't do anything. I have to sell it. Okay. So the idea,
[4094.73s -> 4106.57s]  here's the idea. If I can build this this way, a couple more, make it clean. So I can,
[4106.57s -> 4113.83s]  I can actually walk on this. The cleaner this is, the better,
[4114.47s -> 4121.29s]  because then I can actually use it and walk backwards and delete it.
[4124.22s -> 4140.78s]  Almost there. Okay. I should now be able to do this. Not yet. I need to build this
[4140.78s -> 4156.62s]  one. Okay. Here we go. Come on. Use that brain. Okay. I did it. It's done. Now I
[4156.62s -> 4163.06s]  just have to, we're going to go down here and then know which one, what do I do first?
[4165.22s -> 4174.14s]  I've made, yeah, I've made this a puzzle game. I have to start over here. Don't
[4174.22s -> 4196.89s]  fall off. Falling off ruins. If I fall now, it's fucked the whole thing forever. My heart
[4196.89s -> 4203.85s]  should not be beating this fast. What's wrong with me? Why? All right. I'm doing it. I'm
[4203.85s -> 4213.91s]  going for it. I got it. I'm so paranoid because if I fall now, see, look at,
[4213.91s -> 4228.70s]  I fucked it up there. It's all right, everybody. Calm down. Oh, mini golf.
[4228.70s -> 4234.22s]  Oh, we're going to build stairs now. Just going to nowhere.
[4240.25s -> 4262.26s]  They're getting denser. I have to, oh fuck. It's like climbing Everest. I feel like I'm really
[4262.26s -> 4267.30s]  standing on these. I don't like this at all. I'm never doing this ever again. I'm never doing
[4267.30s -> 4272.04s]  this in this game ever again. Why would I ever do it in the first place? Now there is a lip.
[4273.50s -> 4280.22s]  Can I cross? Yep. Thank God. Oh, all right. That one's done. Now we have to go all the way up.
[4281.74s -> 4304.26s]  Part two. We have to go, now we have to go from here. All the way up and then all the way down.
[4318.31s -> 4321.43s]  As long as I do it right and I can sell them each one as I go down.
[4325.19s -> 4335.72s]  All right, here we are. Right here. Bang. Straight up. Don't fall off.
[4348.52s -> 4353.64s]  Don't make me laugh. If I fall off right now, you understand that the whole thing
[4355.66s -> 4361.66s]  was to get this one tower and if I fall off, I have to do it again because I made two now.
[4368.50s -> 4372.58s]  Fucking Jesus. And then I have to make three and then I have to make four.
[4374.68s -> 4382.46s]  Don't! Where am I? Oh no, where am I? What am I standing on? Okay, I made it. I made it. I
[4382.46s -> 4411.67s]  can't jump. Okay, here we go. Okay, I'm good. I did it. I actually did it. Oh, thank God.
[4424.90s -> 4435.29s]  Oh, thank goodness. That whole crisis can now be put behind us. Seriously. Oh, fuck. Easy.
[4435.85s -> 4510.84s]  Uh oh. Oh! I missed one? What are you talking about? I did not miss one. Wait, did I? Lie.
[4513.10s -> 4526.15s]  I will not have that. It's clean. There's not one up there. Oh man, that would have sucked. Okay,
[4526.15s -> 4535.86s]  what? What are we doing? All right, I got those in my vision. There's one near the tree. No,
[4535.86s -> 4550.04s]  there is not one near the tree. They're all gone. Build a roller coaster. What do you mean
[4550.04s -> 4564.42s]  the tree? Nobody sees it. It's a lie. All right, here we go. I want to make a garden here.
[4564.50s -> 4570.49s]  I'm gonna say, let's start from here. I want like a nice little patch right here coming out
[4571.21s -> 4576.55s]  to here. But the trees are in the way. Why can't I just get rid of the trees?
[4576.55s -> 4595.67s]  I don't want those trees. Make a roller coaster. No. All right, I'll have to incorporate
[4595.67s -> 4607.02s]  the trees. So, I want, I want like, God, I want. Anybody want some wine? I think I'm
[4607.02s -> 4620.41s]  gonna get a glass of wine. Just like one. I want to sip on it. I haven't had like a good
[4620.41s -> 4630.57s]  wine in a while. Yeah, go get, go get some wine. I'm gonna need your help here. I'm gonna need
[4630.57s -> 4636.15s]  your help in creating this garden. In the comment section, what do you think I should
[4636.15s -> 4644.98s]  put in the next episode? A tree? A moat? You decide. All right, I'm gonna go, let's just
[4644.98s -> 4652.33s]  have a glass of wine. I'll be right back. I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'll be less than,
[4652.33s -> 4948.28s]  I'll be less than 30 minutes, I promise. Time. All right, I'm good. Let's go. Two minutes? Five
[4948.28s -> 4965.37s]  minutes? Three minutes? How many minutes? 89 seconds? I feel like it was longer than that.
[4965.37s -> 4977.64s]  We want you to build a ferris wheel in time. In time. I got 399,000. So, wait, let's see.
[4978.52s -> 4983.61s]  I'm getting overwhelmed. I'm overwhelming myself. Slow. I'm not going to even look at
[4983.61s -> 4994.55s]  Chad for like another 25 streams. Okay, what did I want to do? 103, 104. Stop counting. I'm
[4994.55s -> 5018.89s]  breaking my own rule. Okay, I'm gonna test. Architecture. Oh, oh, round gazebo with a dome.
[5018.89s -> 5031.14s]  Let me see. I like that one. Hold on. I'm gonna have such a rich house. Cobblestone
[5031.70s -> 5043.70s]  circle stair up a little stairway up to the gazebo. Three level garden stair. I could have
[5043.70s -> 5066.65s]  just done these. Hmm. I don't know which one. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. How about this one?
[5066.65s -> 5090.89s]  Let's just see what it looks like. I can just sell it. That's too big. I think it's too big
[5090.89s -> 5110.71s]  to put anywhere. Maybe here? I need the mini one. But I can't put a garden in here.
[5110.71s -> 5117.45s]  This is bigger than the other one. No, that didn't say mini gazebo. It was minio gazebo,
[5117.45s -> 5141.14s]  not mini. I don't think maybe I don't even need one of these. What if it was like a
[5141.14s -> 5147.50s]  little entryway off of the okay. So hold on. Here we are. Here's the front door. We're gonna
[5147.50s -> 5154.06s]  get some nice stones here with a little another walkway that leads over here into the garden.
[5157.24s -> 5160.76s]  So it goes you go through here. You go through the metal detector to make sure like
[5162.01s -> 5171.02s]  and then you come to the garden. It's crooked. Yeah, I just I'm just placing it there.
[5175.10s -> 5190.04s]  Well, I didn't maybe didn't pick the right color. Well, not. Yeah, get out of here.
[5190.76s -> 5202.49s]  Just I'm gonna put it there for now. I need a front entryway here.
[5203.29s -> 5207.69s]  Entryway over this way leading into the garden here. There can be a nice garden here
[5208.57s -> 5212.09s]  right here for you to look at. And it starts right here like this.
[5214.10s -> 5217.78s]  I'm gonna I wanted the I want the purple scheme that I had. Why are you fail fishing
[5217.78s -> 5228.82s]  me? I put a I I put a the wooden stand. What's wrong with that? I placed it on the
[5228.82s -> 5236.34s]  ground. It's not going to be there permanently. No, you're getting out. You're getting in the way
[5236.34s -> 5240.34s]  of my vision. All right, so we're gonna have I want the purple, the red, the I want the purple
[5241.06s -> 5246.09s]  red and the and like kind of pink scale going up. Watch what I'm doing here.
[5246.09s -> 5290.33s]  Pay attention. Close fucking attention. Nice fence. Let's keep it that same color.
[5291.21s -> 5308.97s]  Looks awful. What if it looks awful? It doesn't look awful. I haven't even done
[5308.97s -> 5351.61s]  anything. No, it's gonna be it's gonna be to here. What are you guys on about?
[5352.01s -> 5391.35s]  What are you guys on right now? Why does this look wrong? That's better. The car guys,
[5391.35s -> 5400.23s]  the cars have to be able to go. Wait. Oh, fuck me. Okay, no. Um, no, this is still fine.
[5400.23s -> 5408.60s]  This is fine. This is this is the gate to the backyard. Everyone has a gate to the backyard.
[5408.60s -> 5413.70s]  Gate to the backyard and there's a nice walkway garden. Everyone that's talking all
[5413.70s -> 5423.13s]  this shit and typing all this shit in just under 12 to 15 hours, but would take a normal
[5423.13s -> 5432.79s]  person probably six. You're gonna eat those words. Why do you have an entrance in the middle
[5432.79s -> 5440.62s]  of your front yard? Because this is not the front yard. This is now the backyard.
[5441.42s -> 5455.27s]  This is the backyard. Here's the front yard. And then boom, backyard. Well, technically,
[5455.27s -> 5467.46s]  actually, it should be lined up here. I used to do this shit for money. Okay. I used to
[5467.46s -> 5488.50s]  move fences for money. I think I know what's going on. I knew it was wrong.
[5489.14s -> 5509.37s]  Is there like a snapping feature? Because I can't get a good look as I have to.
[5509.37s -> 5569.05s]  I'm gonna sneeze. There's nothing I can do. I'm gonna sneeze again. I can't press any buttons.
[5569.93s -> 5588.50s]  You don't like people sneezing. Just close it. Come on. Flush. Flush. Damn it. Don't
[5588.50s -> 5607.69s]  make me get the plunger. Toilet humor. That wasn't what? How is that like a toilet like
[5607.69s -> 5628.55s]  poo poo joke? I could have been flushing anything. God damn it. Can I add like a
[5628.55s -> 5644.82s]  section? Half fence? No. Fuck. No. Why? Why can I not extend this? I'm gonna have to
[5644.82s -> 5654.20s]  have a tree right here. This is a doggy entrance. No, this is the entrance to the back garden.
[5654.20s -> 5661.30s]  Just use hedges. There are hedges already here. That's gonna look fucking strange.
[5661.86s -> 5665.14s]  There's already like a line of bushes. Oh, just put another one right here.
[5665.78s -> 5679.46s]  No criminal will just like wedge his way into it. Is it straight? Let's give it a good look.
[5679.46s -> 5685.02s]  It's pretty, it's pretty straight. I cannot delete these bushes. No,
[5686.07s -> 5692.15s]  we'll put something there. We'll figure it out. All right. Anyways, so here,
[5693.11s -> 5700.79s]  bang. Nice little garden to start. In fact, I'm gonna do bingo. Bingo. This is gonna drive
[5700.79s -> 5741.64s]  me fucking crazy. It's gonna drive me crazy. Oh, God damn it. Just roll it out there.
[5742.20s -> 5752.02s]  I'm just gonna have it go all the way. Jermis, please stop. Please stop what?
[5756.73s -> 5767.13s]  What? Why? Just stop it. What do you want me to stop exactly?
[5767.13s -> 5781.03s]  The grass is crooked. Once it's all laid out there, you're not gonna know. That
[5781.03s -> 5799.69s]  would be different. I'm getting there. It's gonna look really nice. I promise.
[5799.69s -> 5802.89s]  If there's one thing I can promise you, is it will look good.
[5803.77s -> 5810.25s]  Pick up the trash first. I'm just going one at a time because if I,
[5815.35s -> 5822.49s]  just stop. Don't make promises you can't keep. I see you mean like over here.
[5823.21s -> 5843.19s]  Because I need to, I need to get it finished as I go. Yeah, I'm supposed to be in the other
[5843.19s -> 5856.02s]  corner. What situation should Jermapup be used in? That's at your discretion,
[5856.02s -> 5879.32s]  whatever you feel. Good, good, good. Come here. All right, that should be enough.
[5879.88s -> 5895.48s]  Let's get the edge here. I don't see any more on the mini-map in this corner, at least.
[5895.48s -> 5898.82s]  So I think we're good. Except it's behind the hedges though, which is,
[5898.82s -> 5902.68s]  how the hell would you even see that? There's no way you would see that shit.
[5903.48s -> 5926.70s]  I can't get it all in one pass, unfortunately. Come on, look at the mini-map. It's right here.
[5929.16s -> 5948.89s]  Did I get it? Yeah, I did. Come on, get it. Get it all. Oh, yes. Okay, there's one last
[5948.89s -> 5957.48s]  little speck right here. Got it in one more right here. All right, we're officially completely
[5957.48s -> 5969.50s]  clean on this right side. Now the only question is just getting the grass laid out here so I
[5969.50s -> 5977.91s]  can start building. Look at how much more of this is going to be so ridiculous.
[5979.11s -> 5986.31s]  I'm never going to stop streaming. Well, the internet has been pretty decent so far. So,
[5986.31s -> 5994.63s]  I mean, if I got internet, I ain't fucking turning it off. Congratulations, you mowed the
[5994.63s -> 6006.36s]  lawn. Be nicer. You're being very mean. I normally mowed the lawn. I picked up
[6007.08s -> 6016.62s]  3,000 pounds of trash and I'm rolling out new grass. That's a very mean thing to say.
[6024.20s -> 6038.30s]  See, it just happens sometimes. It just does it. There's so much Z-fighting on that fence.
[6038.30s -> 6068.71s]  What do you mean, Z-fighting? Z-fighting? What is a Z-fighting? Like anti-aliasing? Are
[6068.71s -> 6076.82s]  we getting a bunch of aliasing? What do you mean, Z-fighting? I don't think I can
[6076.82s -> 6082.42s]  get it all in one roll, but it's worth a try. I have no idea. I have no idea what
[6082.42s -> 6097.93s]  you're talking about. I don't know what Z-fighting is. Oh, the grass in the back?
[6099.64s -> 6115.42s]  Why would I know what Z-fighting means? It's like being in the doctor's office.
[6115.42s -> 6122.71s]  Doctor comes in. Do you know what this tool is? I don't know. Is it a stethoscope? No,
[6122.71s -> 6128.25s]  stupid. Why do you not know that? It's a hydroscope. What, are you stupid? You're
[6128.25s -> 6141.46s]  pretty dumb. Oh, okay. Ha, I'm an idiot. Right chat. He's got a fucking GoPro on.
[6142.18s -> 6160.71s]  He's like looking away while he's doing like an exam.
[6165.18s -> 6172.70s]  Everything seems fine. Doctor, my stomach is hurting. You're touching my neck. Oh,
[6172.70s -> 6188.07s]  sorry. I was looking at chat. What'd you come in for? That shit's gonna be real.
[6191.58s -> 6195.32s]  You think that's me fucking around? Give it like another 50 years.
[6211.26s -> 6220.14s]  What would his alert sounds be? A flatline. Hey, thank you, flatliners. Welcome to the
[6220.14s -> 6234.33s]  flatliners. Am I okay? Yeah, he comes in. Your leg hooked up. You're like just had
[6234.33s -> 6244.58s]  surgery. You're sitting there. All of a sudden the flatline comes on. Is something wrong?
[6244.58s -> 6258.73s]  What's happening? Thank you, bddoc21666. 25 months. Welcome to the flatlining patients.
[6259.91s -> 6266.04s]  Yeah, you just flatlined, didn't you? Oh, here, take these. This would help for the
[6266.04s -> 6287.50s]  pain and oh, thank you. Hey, whoa, 20, 32 months sub just came in from oh, hey, doc should poison
[6287.50s -> 6306.68s]  the patient. That's a funny username. But no, seriously, take those once every four hours.
[6306.68s -> 6318.73s]  This is not gonna work. What even is this room? What is this? Room 86 M2. All right,
[6318.73s -> 6323.45s]  hold on. This is the front door and then this is so this is a back slider and then
[6324.09s -> 6328.50s]  this is like another two car garage. No, the staircase is here. There's another back door.
[6331.70s -> 6344.54s]  Oh, this is a sub. Hey, thank you. Thank you. Room 86 M2 for the 12 months. Appreciate it. No,
[6344.54s -> 6356.97s]  that's not the garage. The garage is over here. It's a normal living room. Is it though?
[6356.97s -> 6363.69s]  Because you have two, three back entry ways to the it's kind of odd. I don't think that
[6364.33s -> 6367.53s]  one of these this would be normal. But this is seems like kind of redundant.
[6370.26s -> 6388.02s]  Somebody just gave $115. That's $115. That's Hayden clip fell for the 115 bucks.
[6388.66s -> 6403.69s]  That's a lot of money. There's no message here. You've just flatlined. Welcome. You've just
[6403.69s -> 6409.77s]  flatlined. I've just flatlined. No, no, idiot. I'm looking to chat. You're dumb.
[6424.50s -> 6431.45s]  It would be a scenario. Doctor's doing surgery. But first of all, before we get into this,
[6431.45s -> 6435.13s]  that's a fucking lot of money. There's no message here. You just gave me a ton of money.
[6435.13s -> 6443.53s]  Thank you, Hayden. That's a lot of fucking money. Thank you. All I can say is thanks.
[6443.53s -> 6453.93s]  That's more than I could ever ask anyone to ever give me in in dollars ever. What's
[6453.93s -> 6469.06s]  going on here? Why? Strange. But yeah, imagine the doctor's doing surgery. He's got the chat
[6469.06s -> 6476.34s]  open. And he's doing like, like a gallstone removal on somebody. All of a sudden, he like
[6476.34s -> 6483.42s]  misses one blind, blind, dude, I can't can you not see that? How can he be this stupid? He
[6483.42s -> 6490.78s]  can't see that other gallstone. What are you guys talking about? I got them all. Wow. Holy
[6490.78s -> 6501.99s]  shit. He's so bad. He like moves it moves the organ over here. I don't over this way.
[6507.19s -> 6529.91s]  Is he pretending? Is he pretending to be this bad? He's faking it. You know how people like
[6530.79s -> 6555.80s]  overreact and stuff like, whoa, jump scare. Actually overreacting twitch doctor. Yeah,
[6555.80s -> 6560.52s]  somebody comes in, they get like, oh, yeah, I feel like really strange recently. Like I was
[6560.52s -> 6564.28s]  outside in the woods outside the woods. Oh, yeah, what chat? I wonder what it could be.
[6564.28s -> 6568.42s]  Let's guess it. What should we do? I'm gonna put the clicks on the screen. What do you think
[6568.42s -> 6587.02s]  we should test them for? I think tick-borne tick-borne. I think so. Get some results back.
[6587.58s -> 6595.51s]  Yeah, it was tick. Yeah. Yeah. Tick-borne illness. We got it. Chat. We got it. Pogchamp.
[6595.51s -> 6611.75s]  No, no, no, it'd be something else. It'd be like, it'd be like doc champ. And it'd be
[6611.75s -> 6623.56s]  like him with a stethoscope on like having his mouth open like what? I mean, the small
[6624.04s -> 6636.52s]  look like cigars or no, they look like those little Debbie rolls. You know, those chocolate
[6636.52s -> 6644.44s]  rolls. What are they called? The swirls like the little Debbie rolls. Swiss rolls. There it is.
[6644.44s -> 6660.12s]  Yeah. No, not turd rolls. Swiss rolls. The doctor's been screaming for like fucking
[6660.12s -> 6666.41s]  eight hours straight in the middle of like fucking surgery. Oh, that's going to be it.
[6666.41s -> 6670.89s]  I think I'm just fucking beat, you know, I'll see you guys tomorrow. We'll pick it up for
[6670.89s -> 6679.64s]  where we left off. Just keep this guy in sedation. I'll just just save the game.
[6679.64s -> 6694.15s]  Yeah, I'll save it here. Fuck, to take some wine breaks. I don't think I can get over here.
[6694.15s -> 6698.23s]  Same problem from last time. There's going to be this one tiny little stupid patch that I
[6698.23s -> 6713.59s]  can't get. Oh, that's annoying. Oh, that's annoying. I hate that. Come on. Nope. Just
[6713.59s -> 6726.63s]  gravel. Yeah, I'll have to. Oh, that's, I hate it. No, this collision here for some
[6726.63s -> 6747.91s]  reason. Delete the trees? I can't. Oh, I fucking thought I had it. Oh well. Can't get them all.
[6747.91s -> 6756.14s]  But I can do this. Sell trees. Sell, you can't sell trees. Look, look, look, look, look, look.
[6758.58s -> 6778.63s]  See? Cheaty. Looks good. I mean, I know I did, I said I wasn't going to do this,
[6778.63s -> 6790.38s]  but I might as well. Jerma, please, I'm a fan. Concerned about your, I've been adamant,
[6790.38s -> 6792.78s]  in the past you've been adamant that you've been fine, but now it seems like you need
[6792.78s -> 6796.06s]  at least one glass each stream to get by. Is it us? Do we make the stream harder to get
[6796.06s -> 6823.29s]  through? Jesus Christ. Is it us? The last time I had a glass of wine on stream or alcohol
[6823.29s -> 6830.62s]  on stream was Nintendo Labo. That was like three and a half weeks ago. Almost a month ago.
[6831.18s -> 6837.26s]  More than that. Uh, so I, I don't know what stream you're talking about because that's
[6837.26s -> 6849.85s]  not this one. Hammer the tree? It don't work. Watch, I'll prove it. See? Told you. Told you.
[6851.98s -> 6859.18s]  Oh, Jebaited. Chat, you know, you don't understand. It doesn't work. I'm not going to use the,
[6859.18s -> 6864.06s]  the saw on his bone, on his leg. That's not going to work. It's not going to fix his,
[6864.06s -> 6869.53s]  uh, it's not going to fix his gallbladder. Do it, do it, do it. Oh my God. All right, fine.
[6873.78s -> 6895.54s]  See? Oh, did I just get Jebaited? Oh, he used drill on toe. He's still on the doctor bit.
[6895.54s -> 6902.26s]  Yeah, I'm kind of stuck on it. I just, things just keep popping into my brain. So I have to
[6902.26s -> 6920.12s]  just say them out loud. Right, wait, right there, right here. Oh, come on. What do you mean,
[6920.12s -> 6932.73s]  clear the path? There's nothing in the path. The path is already written. Come on. I'm the
[6932.73s -> 6938.09s]  best. I'm the best. I'm the best at what I do. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best
[6938.17s -> 6963.40s]  at what I do. What is it that you do? Whatever it is I do. I mean, that's, come on. That's clear.
[6963.40s -> 6975.46s]  Look at how far away this is. Patch notes. Garden Flipper. 1.104. Remove collision around
[6975.46s -> 7005.10s]  trees. Come on. Come on. I'm just going to have to like go like this. I shouldn't have to
[7005.10s -> 7047.05s]  do it like this. Yeah, I'm done. I'm done. Yeah, I'm, no, I'm done. That's it. I
[7047.05s -> 7055.85s]  somehow made it worse. I know. And that's why I gave up. I'm going to do one right here.
[7057.26s -> 7065.29s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, stutter step, stutter step, stutter step. Maybe I should just
[7065.29s -> 7069.14s]  clean it all up. But then I'm going to be overwhelmed. I'm going to look around and go,
[7069.14s -> 7078.58s]  fuck, this is too big. I'm just going to make a pizza oven as the house. All right. No,
[7078.58s -> 7085.46s]  it's clean enough for me to do what I want to do over here. Now I've got to get my vision
[7085.46s -> 7105.26s]  to unfold. Come on. Think about something. Okay, I got it. Get this out of the way.
[7106.06s -> 7117.38s]  We're going to go one step at a time. I need a entryway. First of all, we need a door here.
[7117.38s -> 7125.50s]  First of all, give me a door so I can look at this the way that I should look at it. No,
[7125.50s -> 7133.10s]  not yet. Cause I need to, I need, um, we're going to go stone, stone, stone, stone, stone.
[7134.36s -> 7144.33s]  Um, no, I won't put the surface. No, not the terrible tablet that fucking crashes every
[7144.33s -> 7159.43s]  five minutes. I want one of these. Hmm. What I want for a walk. Maybe take the gravel.
[7164.87s -> 7178.38s]  This is nice. Let's see what this looks like. I'm thinking the beige. I think there's a bigger
[7178.38s -> 7197.62s]  version of this. No, that looks like dog shit. I don't want that. I like this. How does it feel
[7197.62s -> 7212.39s]  to be employed by thousands of people? I mean, I'm a man of the people. Hmm. Orange,
[7212.39s -> 7222.15s]  orange isn't bad, but dark gray is not bad either. Let's see. Let me see what this looks
[7222.15s -> 7228.07s]  like. I need to get paving stones, painting stones block without a curve, paving stone.
[7228.07s -> 7235.64s]  That's going to get paving stone, paving stones. Here we go. All right. That looks all right.
[7240.52s -> 7253.19s]  Ooh, we can do a little trim too. Ooh, that is a really, really nice blue and white
[7253.19s -> 7274.55s]  paving stone. Hmm. That's a beautiful blue and white. What are you talking about? You see,
[7274.55s -> 7281.74s]  you see gold and where's the gold? I don't understand what you're talking about. Golden
[7281.74s -> 7290.76s]  and blue. What? I don't see that shit. What are you crazy? That's not the color of that dress.
[7292.12s -> 7304.42s]  Your brain is wired strangely. You guys don't know what I'm talking about. That is like,
[7304.42s -> 7312.18s]  this is the exact color scheme of that picture. What? That's like, this is the same exact
[7312.18s -> 7328.04s]  color scheme. Golden, white, blue. Yeah, come on. Did I see this joke on Facebook? I saw
[7328.04s -> 7344.17s]  the picture on Facebook. I like this. Jeez. Fucking rough crowd tonight. Rough crowd out
[7344.17s -> 7354.62s]  there. Be careful. They're all like drinking wine. Uh, should I go into the house with this?
[7354.62s -> 7391.56s]  Let's get a little bit more here. How's this wrong? It's not even wrong. Wrong. This is
[7391.56s -> 7401.26s]  actually very incorrect. If you were looking, no, this is not wrong because look, guys, guys,
[7401.26s -> 7406.47s]  guys, guys. If it is, if it's lined up perfectly here, then it won't be lined up
[7406.47s -> 7421.22s]  perfectly with the door. Uh-oh. Have we reached like the event horizon here? We're
[7421.22s -> 7446.02s]  at the event horizon. How does this look? That's not bad. No, no, no, no. What happened
[7446.02s -> 7466.34s]  there? Okay. Then we're going to go like this. Okay. What color do I want for gravel? Two-tone.
[7466.90s -> 7471.51s]  Look up, look up. We got like a, let me just see what this would look like.
[7472.15s -> 7503.93s]  I can't just put it. Why can I not do that? Well, I can. This is grandma's rug. It's
[7503.93s -> 7509.74s]  not grandma's rug. It doesn't look like, I know, we already made the fish tank reference,
[7509.74s -> 7532.65s]  the bottom of the ocean reference. I need to do rounded, I think. Do the other side.
[7533.74s -> 7539.66s]  Uneven laughing my ass off. Oh, get out of here. Get out of here with that. What do you mean
[7539.66s -> 7547.34s]  uneven? I got, it's, yeah, it is uneven. It's rocks. They're rocks. You can't have a straight
[7547.34s -> 7566.92s]  line with rocks. Uneven. Oh my God. It's uneven. Those crushed stones. Hey, better
[7566.92s -> 7576.79s]  than your house. I love that argument. Better than what you have. Better than what you did.
[7576.79s -> 7582.97s]  Dude, this stream like sucks. Oh, better than your stream. Have you streamed before?
[7582.97s -> 7593.75s]  Better than your stream. I don't, fuck you buddy. Actually, I want to go a little, a little more.
[7593.75s -> 7606.12s]  Hey dude, on the webcam, you had like something in your teeth. I did, like a bunch of asparagus
[7606.12s -> 7611.62s]  or shit. Yeah, better than your stream. Do you stream? You don't fucking know. No, I'm, okay.
[7611.62s -> 7635.58s]  I should probably do round. Hey dude, I, did you just like punch a guy in the face on stream
[7635.58s -> 7640.07s]  that didn't do anything? Okay. Yeah. Whatever. You don't stream. Where's your stream if it's
[7640.07s -> 7659.13s]  so easy? This is not good. What? I'm just starting. This is going to expand out a little.
[7659.13s -> 7661.77s]  Give me some, give me a day. Do you even stream? Do you even know what it's like?
[7667.26s -> 7674.94s]  The fucking Dreamcast sucks. Laughing my ass off. The Dreamcast, what was it? It was the Dreamcast
[7674.94s -> 7682.06s]  fucking sucks. Laughing my ass off. All right, I did fuck that one up. I'll give that one to
[7682.06s -> 7690.26s]  you. I'll give that one to you. Yeah, I fucked it up. Dad, what are you, okay. Thank, great. What, why?
[7692.70s -> 7705.05s]  Actually, hold on a second here. I think I can, I'm going to do some sculpting.
[7705.85s -> 7728.33s]  This is gonna, this is gonna be actually kind of cool. They didn't go out of the gate. Bad
[7729.21s -> 7733.53s]  illusions of sculpting. No, I'm gonna start out big here and we're gonna put a couple of
[7733.53s -> 7749.06s]  bushes in the shit. Just bear with me. I'm gonna do some sculpting. This is not ruined.
[7749.78s -> 7778.36s]  You guys have ever been to a house in Las Vegas? That shows. You guys, no, never mind.
[7778.36s -> 7811.53s]  I'm gonna, just watch. Wait, just give me a second. Guys, Rome wasn't built in a day.
[7812.49s -> 7830.31s]  It looks like the house is puking. I want that guy out of here for life. Comparing this house to
[7830.31s -> 7835.03s]  Rome. Yes, I am. If there's a problem with that, you don't even know it's like to stream.
[7836.76s -> 7854.39s]  Okay, I'll stop that one. Okay, hold on here. That's why I need enough to like
[7854.95s -> 7869.19s]  carve. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[7869.83s -> 7901.94s]  Dude, I can't help that it makes like the jagged Minecraft pixels. Okay,
[7901.94s -> 7911.61s]  you guys want perfection? Fine. It's not possible. Perfection doesn't exist.
[7911.61s -> 7935.94s]  Get that out of your head. Perfection doesn't exist, he says. Okay, now here I wanted to
[7935.94s -> 7960.73s]  go like this. All right, right here. Make it look a little more natural. I wish I could have the
[7960.73s -> 7977.88s]  like Photoshop. Why is this not Photoshop? I really need to, I need to get like here.
[7982.33s -> 7997.74s]  Okay, you see that line? Pull this in a little more. Okay, it's hard to do this when
[7997.74s -> 8028.06s]  you can't start from the edge. You have to be on top of it. This ain't like a brush tool in
[8028.06s -> 8055.96s]  Photoshop, guys. It's not gonna do what I want it to do. Yeah, yeah. Okay, same thing over here.
[8057.08s -> 8067.03s]  So it starts, curve begins here. I need a little more, but it goes like this.
[8067.03s -> 8080.36s]  It's got to be up a little more. I'm gonna put some bushes here. You can't just skip
[8080.36s -> 8100.04s]  all this shit. So this is way too much. I got a misleading line because the pixels
[8100.04s -> 8105.88s]  are being deleted. All right, look it. Don't tell me I did that wrong when I had a clear
[8105.88s -> 8139.22s]  line here that's being shaved as I step back. Right here. Right, almost there. I can,
[8139.22s -> 8144.86s]  I can fix this. Don't worry, just watch. I'm gonna have to add some more in here.
[8146.49s -> 8151.50s]  It's getting there. Look down and move backwards because it doesn't matter.
[8151.50s -> 8157.46s]  Because if I move backwards from here, like this, it's already, I'm lined up. And if I
[8157.46s -> 8164.46s]  move backwards from here, it's, there's no, it's not possible. Watch, I'll show you.
[8166.10s -> 8170.10s]  Like I'm gonna start right here. Like I can't, there's no way, unless I have like an
[8170.10s -> 8173.54s]  angle meter on my right hand side of my screen. I have no idea where I'm standing.
[8174.10s -> 8178.66s]  So right here, if I step back, like see, I've already moved to the left.
[8179.30s -> 8193.18s]  And I have to hold the mouse button down. So I, it's, it's going to move.
[8193.82s -> 8203.00s]  There's no clear way to make sure I'm like on the plane.
[8203.64s -> 8218.73s]  Plus CLA, it's like console aiming. No, you can't, it's no way. Like, no, it's not going to happen.
[8220.74s -> 8233.66s]  Use the mini map. How do I do plus and minus on the mini map? I just did? No, I didn't.
[8233.66s -> 8240.38s]  I did not just do that. It doesn't need to be perfect. Rome wasn't fucking perfect.
[8243.43s -> 8247.51s]  They did, they did, they took their fucking time and like Rome was like kind of sloppy.
[8248.63s -> 8259.14s]  Sloppy Rome was built in a few days. I need to add some here. There. I want it
[8259.14s -> 8269.18s]  to be circle though. I'm not, cause it starts like here. Why did you, why are you stopping here?
[8270.18s -> 8274.10s]  Why are you doing that? Why did you do that? Why didn't you just go forward?
[8276.87s -> 8292.30s]  I hate that. Close enough. That's close enough. I can add a little bit right here.
[8301.69s -> 8325.08s]  Got it. I did it. I did it. That's, that's good. Got it. Good. Okay. That's very close.
[8326.44s -> 8331.93s]  It's like this hard line right here does not match up exactly with here. I mean, it kind
[8331.93s -> 8339.19s]  of does. It's the same as when you started. No, it's not. It's a little different. What are you
[8339.19s -> 8356.57s]  drinking? All right. So now we're going to dual color here. No, we're not. We're not going to do
[8356.57s -> 8368.26s]  that. We're going to do bushes. I gotta go back to the garden setting. Let me do the bushes
[8368.26s -> 8379.35s]  first. It's dumb. Looks like shit. Incredibly ugly. Like I would never have that in my
[8379.35s -> 8432.47s]  house. Throw it in the trash. Is that all of them? No. Oh, that's a normie bush. How is that a
[8432.47s -> 8443.74s]  normie bush? This is the shit that's in fucking Las Vegas. Normie bush? Is it a, no, this is a
[8443.74s -> 8456.12s]  normie bush. Like one of these. The bush, a normie bush is a cloud that is colored green.
[8456.12s -> 8473.37s]  That's a normie bush. Oh, I like these. I'm gonna, I'm gonna move these around.
[8473.37s -> 8491.30s]  A couple of hostas. I feel like I want these to be a little bigger. I want something bigger
[8491.30s -> 8512.12s]  here. Let me see. I need like a little bit bigger, but I still want it to be like desert
[8512.12s -> 8526.26s]  Vegas style. Let's go down here. 0.5. I need like a couple of meters, I think. A palm tree.
[8527.08s -> 8538.86s]  No, that'd be weird in your house. I could get a big one. Wait, hold on. Ooh, not bad. Let's
[8538.86s -> 8555.70s]  see. No, that's not a big one. How about get these? No, this just looks like, this looks
[8556.18s -> 8573.48s]  just like Canadian leaves. Oh, this is not Canada. No, maybe one of these. Creeping dense.
[8574.12s -> 8594.62s]  These are trees. Dwarf shrub. No, these aren't bad. How big are these? I like that kind of
[8594.62s -> 8608.15s]  greenish. Um, could go like here and then here and then have like a big one right here and
[8608.15s -> 8627.45s]  a big one right here. These are the worst plants. All right, I need something bigger,
[8628.41s -> 8638.46s]  large. Maybe a ball bush. No. Ooh, yeah. Yep. Mm hmm. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. These are everywhere
[8638.46s -> 8643.38s]  out here. What color should it be? None of these. This is, this is good. Like kind of
[8643.38s -> 8653.32s]  that little off green kind of like baby shit color. One here and maybe like one here.
[8653.32s -> 8675.19s]  Let me just see. No, got to be a different color. I think I want a different color. I
[8675.19s -> 8689.51s]  think I want a green. I'll get a couple of flowers in here too. Yeah, that's a good idea.
[8689.51s -> 8691.59s]  I think I want to, I think I want to just straight up green though.
[8692.63s -> 8697.13s]  Let me see what that looks like. If it looks any better. Move these out of the way.
[8698.41s -> 8720.33s]  Oh man. Oh man. Man. Wait a minute here. Man. Wait. I'm not happy with the placement.
[8751.43s -> 8762.10s]  Symmetrical house. What? I like symmetry with plants. This is a tutorial on rails
[8762.10s -> 8778.20s]  arcade shooter house. What? What an insanely specific thing to say. Yeah. Can we make,
[8778.20s -> 8785.91s]  we'll make a little pond here. Everyone likes to just talk shit. That looks stupid. That looks
[8785.91s -> 8792.38s]  terrible. I think that's not even good. You should have this kind of plant and then you
[8792.38s -> 8807.58s]  should bury that one in the sand. What an ugly display. You should see my display. It's
[8807.58s -> 8832.70s]  marvelous. We unlocked a new voice. Nice. Power Ranger bad guy voice.
[8838.38s -> 8862.15s]  Oh, that's fucking hilarious. It's true. That is a hundred percent correct. After 10,000 years,
[8862.15s -> 8872.92s]  I'm free. It's time to conquer earth. Oh, I can plant it. These, these don't plant. Are
[8872.92s -> 8884.52s]  these just sitting in the, okay. Do I not plant them? I guess they don't get planted.
[8887.26s -> 8892.54s]  All right. Nice. Okay. Let's grab a flower or two, a nice desert flower because we're in
[8892.54s -> 8912.97s]  the desert. We're not. Do Zordon. Power Rangers, it's me Zordon. There it is. That's all you can,
[8912.97s -> 8921.78s]  that's all I can do. We can do like pots. That's cool. Matilda has landed on earth.
[8923.03s -> 8936.36s]  She's trying to take it over. I can't believe that. What was his name? Ooh,
[8936.36s -> 8956.92s]  I need a different color here though. No, this doesn't work. What idiot hired this
[8956.92s -> 8960.92s]  landscaper? This idiot did. I hired this idiot landscaper because I'm the idiot that
[8960.92s -> 8995.42s]  owns the idiot house. I can't place it. Oh, is it too, it's gotta be smaller. I need,
[8995.42s -> 9010.65s]  I want it right here. Can I make it, is there a little one round shaped pond fountain? Should
[9010.65s -> 9020.95s]  I just have like fucking fountains? Like up here, two fountains right when you walk in the
[9020.95s -> 9040.52s]  front door. Yeah, I like it. I want a pond here. Actually, no, why would you have a pond
[9040.52s -> 9049.72s]  at the front door? Should I just have a bunch of these? Like these things are cool. No, no,
[9049.72s -> 9058.07s]  no. I'm blowing my whole budget at the front door. I think that looks nice. We need a pond,
[9058.07s -> 9078.49s]  a little one. I want some flowers though. I need, um, stop the symmetry. What's wrong
[9078.49s -> 9092.25s]  with symmetry? Are they cactus? I don't think they're a cactus. No, unfortunately no cactus.
[9092.25s -> 9102.28s]  It's very old fashioned. There's something wrong with that. I think I want, I mean this looks
[9102.28s -> 9109.02s]  like shit. You'd think it looks like shit because of this. The house needs work. You know,
[9109.02s -> 9113.18s]  we'll go on inside out. There's a bug on me. No, there's not. Jesus Christ, I'm out of my
[9113.18s -> 9121.74s]  mind. I'm something wrong with my brain. I'm losing my mind. I've lost my brain. It's gone.
[9121.74s -> 9125.35s]  I don't have it anymore. My headphones touched me in the neck and I thought there was a
[9125.35s -> 9135.88s]  scorpion on me. I don't do any drugs. I, I'm, I'm like sober. I'm, I don't understand.
[9136.52s -> 9146.58s]  All right, I need to get rid of those because this just, this is bringing the whole thing down.
[9147.54s -> 9151.00s]  I don't like the color on the outside either. We're doing, I'm doing a Vegas house.
[9152.82s -> 9165.61s]  Vegas style. Can I not open the window from out here? To climb to the roof?
[9166.25s -> 9177.69s]  How am I supposed to remove these? How do I get there? This, I think this is impossible.
[9184.42s -> 9193.53s]  Uh, can I just reach them? Yeah, I can just reach them. Okay, so now there's no boarded up
[9193.53s -> 9203.99s]  windows. I mean, it's ugly in here and the, I gotta get the outside. I'm, I'm either painting
[9203.99s -> 9214.22s]  or I need, um, I need like that, like Adobe look. Let's see here. No, um, walls, right?
[9214.94s -> 9235.74s]  It's too dark. Plaster bucket. No, wood brick. I mean, it's, that's not like
[9235.74s -> 9254.63s]  wood though. You know what I mean? Like, no, that's not going to look right. Can I like,
[9259.05s -> 9265.06s]  no, I'm not sure I can do it. This is the closest thing, but this is going to look really
[9265.06s -> 9285.69s]  strange. Let me just see. Is he going to do what I asked for the past 50 minutes? What
[9285.69s -> 9305.22s]  am I doing? He's doing it. What, what are we talking about? He's doing it. No, that's not
[9305.22s -> 9324.06s]  going to look right. No, not 3d. It's gotta be that like beige kind of orange reds like this,
[9324.06s -> 9339.40s]  but that's not correct. This is a floor tile. What about maybe paint? Let me check the paint.
[9340.34s -> 9353.14s]  I'll try to paint it something. It's like this. Let me just see what happens when I do this.
[9353.78s -> 9361.75s]  Although there are a lot of houses in, in, in like apartments and complexes that are
[9361.83s -> 9398.18s]  this color. Let's see what this looks like. Wait a minute. That's no, uh, no, that's,
[9398.18s -> 9416.50s]  that's good. I say it's got to be, no, it's not a flesh house. The walls just look like
[9416.50s -> 9421.82s]  this stained. Well, I can't do the thing I want to do. How do you even have something on the
[9421.82s -> 9431.62s]  outside? Why ceramic tiles classic green? Why can't I just pick the color? Why just,
[9431.62s -> 9442.95s]  oh, we got a screen. Sorry. Only green wall panels. All we got is grandma paper and wood.
[9446.33s -> 9465.62s]  I need like outside walls plaster. No plaster is, is to fill holes. Use ceramic. Yeah. But
[9465.62s -> 9485.10s]  ceramic, these are, these are the floor. These are wall tiles. Yeah. They,
[9486.20s -> 9501.35s]  this maybe is close enough. Ceramic orange. I'm going to try it. Drink the plaster. Okay.
[9501.35s -> 9514.31s]  What's going to happen if I do that? Oh no, that's not good. I need a lighter than that.
[9516.07s -> 9533.86s]  I can't, well, I can advise it only this one color. This might be it. I think I got it.
[9533.86s -> 9552.74s]  No, Garfield house. No, this is, I got to get this right. This is important.
[9552.74s -> 9565.70s]  The tiles are too small. What about this one? Like a light. This could be it.
[9565.70s -> 9594.70s]  This could be close. Don't use ceramic on the exterior. Yeah. But I'm trying,
[9594.70s -> 9599.62s]  I'm trying to find the closest thing to the house that I'm trying to make.
[9599.62s -> 9606.15s]  It's either wood, ceramic or tile. Those are the only three materials that exist in this game.
[9608.57s -> 9623.86s]  I have a way, do I want or brick? Yeah. But the brick just looks,
[9624.58s -> 9632.89s]  this, this is like the pizza house again. I'm just going to lightly paint it,
[9632.89s -> 9642.15s]  but what is this? What are these? What tiles are these? Which ones are these? I don't,
[9642.15s -> 9661.86s]  I don't see these anywhere. What are these called? This is just a concrete slabs on the
[9661.86s -> 9691.11s]  side of the house. It's a paving slab. Can you even paint over concrete? I wish there was like
[9691.11s -> 9721.82s]  exterior walls, just brick. This is just this, these two colors of brick. It's hiding. No,
[9721.82s -> 9738.47s]  package of panels, package of panels. And it's all these like Dracula walls.
[9738.47s -> 9755.83s]  This is, I'm going to have to paint it. Yeah. This is a Dracula wall. That's the
[9755.83s -> 9763.50s]  inside of Dracula's coffin. So is that. So is this. And so is this. All right. Let's see.
[9763.50s -> 9770.74s]  Let's take a look at what these look like. This is, I think this is it.
[9770.74s -> 9777.93s]  This is it. And I don't, it doesn't matter. This is what I'm using. This is close enough.
[9777.93s -> 9798.55s]  Yeah. Close enough. House is not ruined. House is, it's going to look fine.
[9803.86s -> 9831.85s]  Just wait. I'm making my desert getaway. You're not in the desert. Yes, I am. There's no,
[9831.85s -> 9845.03s]  do you see any town symbols or anything here? I could be anywhere. I am where I choose to be.
[9845.03s -> 9853.53s]  This is my fantasy. I can fantasize about wherever I want to be. It's the digital
[9853.61s -> 9859.96s]  internet world. And I fantasize to be right in the same place that I currently am in right now.
[9859.96s -> 9876.25s]  Pretty boring. It's coming together. It's coming together. I can already, I can,
[9876.25s -> 9893.35s]  I know it. I already know what it looks like. Cheesecake flavored brick house.
[9895.56s -> 9902.95s]  You guys are judgmental. What does, I wonder what your exterior walls look like.
[9902.95s -> 9911.21s]  What does your house look like? And why is this here? Are these made out of like bleach?
[9911.21s -> 9940.79s]  Why is it grass dead? Oh, better than your house. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[9940.79s -> 9945.56s]  Look up stone. Uh, and no, it's too late. This is, this is what the house,
[9945.56s -> 9950.36s]  this is fine. Does it look nice? Once I get it all done, I think I need a stairway though
[9950.36s -> 9975.30s]  to do this because I am not like 30 feet tall. No, this is, it's going to look nice.
[9978.42s -> 9987.78s]  Don't crash. You're talking that you are 24, what? 24, what? 34, what do you mean?
[9991.67s -> 10015.42s]  First of all, get all these napkins out of the way. Paint the windowsills dark. Yeah,
[10015.42s -> 10021.45s]  the idea is I want to paint these like a, like a red, like a maroonish, like orange maroon.
[10042.23s -> 10046.76s]  Yeah, like rust red. Yeah, that sounds good. See, you get it. You get it. You
[10046.76s -> 10050.52s]  understand. You get like the, like, this is like a house in the desert. This is like
[10050.52s -> 10074.89s]  Vegas, Arizona. You get it. God, VIP that guy. Shower tiles. All right. Shuttle down.
[10074.89s -> 10085.02s]  Shuttle down. That in Arizona, where boomers go to retire and where sick fucking awesome
[10085.02s -> 10090.22s]  dudes in their thirties go and have like a blast and have like tons of cool things to do and like
[10090.22s -> 10120.38s]  cool fun days. Get rid of these fucking square hot dogs. I can't believe you guys are making
[10120.38s -> 10128.66s]  fun of this and you wanted me to have the hot dog house. Okay. Well, just make sure we're
[10128.66s -> 10133.54s]  clear on that. Pick that one. Pick that one. The hot dog house, like the grilled hot dog.
[10136.86s -> 10163.38s]  Fine. Is it true that Americans eat whole butter bars as a snack?
[10164.10s -> 10172.22s]  Um, I think I can answer this. I'm American here. I don't know what that is. What's a butter bar?
[10172.22s -> 10177.61s]  I don't know what that is. I love how it's something I'm supposed to be eating as a snack
[10177.61s -> 10193.02s]  and I've never heard of it before. Sorry. Is it a sardine? Is it I eat? Well, actually like
[10193.02s -> 10204.70s]  no, like not fucking around. What is it? It's a stick of butter. I've never heard of that.
[10204.70s -> 10213.18s]  A stick of butter. It's a bar of butter. I feel like this is some fantasy world made-up
[10213.18s -> 10221.88s]  thing. I've never come across anyone in my entire life that's ever eaten a bar of a stick of butter
[10221.88s -> 10249.24s]  for a snack. No fucking way. No way. I, yeah, no way. I agree. Okay. Yeah. I'm gonna paint this.
[10249.24s -> 10264.12s]  Can I, can I paint these? I hope I can. Otherwise this is a pain in the ass. Okay. Looks
[10264.12s -> 10279.75s]  good. The stray window is driving me crazy. Oh yeah. That is really weird. Yeah. This,
[10279.75s -> 10284.95s]  but I also said this is weird but this is not weird. The stray window right there but like
[10284.95s -> 10290.70s]  the back door and then the other back door. Two huge sliders that are right here. That's not
[10290.70s -> 10322.44s]  strange and a window. What? That's not weird. This is not the garage. Garage to the backyard.
[10322.44s -> 10328.71s]  No, the garage is right there. I'm gonna make that look real nice too. I'm telling you, this
[10328.71s -> 10334.38s]  is a whole entire project and it's gonna look good. It's gonna look good and I want comparison
[10334.38s -> 10349.13s]  photos. I, hopefully somebody took them. I didn't. Just get a ladder. They don't exist in this
[10349.13s -> 10366.14s]  video game. Don't cut that. Gotta get up here. Sometimes you gotta do the tedious work.
[10366.78s -> 10371.61s]  I'm not selling this house by the way. This is mine. Somebody wants to come take this from
[10371.61s -> 10390.34s]  me? You'll have to take it from my cold, unused hands. I gotta go up. I gotta bring one
[10390.34s -> 10408.12s]  of these with me. What the fuck? Oh. I was like, why is it bleached? No pictures? No,
[10408.12s -> 10415.58s]  there's no pictures. I'm currently putting up new exterior walls. Sorry, there's no
[10415.58s -> 10419.98s]  paintings on the wall yet. I'm not selling. Who's that person? I'm not selling to that person.
[10420.86s -> 10437.99s]  Even if they're the top bidder. Okay. Kind of be impossible, isn't it? I actually am gonna
[10437.99s -> 10452.04s]  have to build those stair things. Yeah, I am. I'm not gonna be looking at the last two or three.
[10458.01s -> 10466.39s]  First of all, let me do this. Let's get a good rust color here. Copper coin. We'll try it.
[10469.46s -> 10488.90s]  And then we'll also try biscuit. No, biscuit's too light. Cream. Raspberry. It's probably
[10488.90s -> 10500.50s]  gonna be nice. The copper coin. Try pale pink. This is kind of like rust. Let's see. Let's
[10500.50s -> 10530.33s]  see what this looks like out here. Oh no, that's not good. I can't paint these. Fuck.
[10530.33s -> 10545.32s]  You can't do new windows either. There's no such thing. I can't like replace them.
[10548.55s -> 10569.78s]  No. No, why? No, this does look bad because of the gray. Ah, fuck. If I could do a rust or a
[10569.78s -> 10581.29s]  red, like a maroon, it would look so much better. Oh well. Too late. I'm just gonna have to do it.
[10581.29s -> 10597.42s]  That's just the way it is. I can't paint these windows out here. No. That's unfortunate. Well,
[10599.32s -> 10630.65s]  let's go ahead and do stairs so I can at least finish it. Why do I have to do this?
[10642.17s -> 10659.59s]  Here we go again. No, I didn't even bring the damn things up here. How am I gonna do this?
[10659.67s -> 10665.40s]  Oh, come on. I'm gonna do more ladder, ladder, ladder, ladder.
[10674.18s -> 10702.50s]  This ladder's tiny. Gym ladder. That's not gonna work. This is so much higher.
[10702.50s -> 10731.59s]  A scaffolding? I don't. No, I don't. What? Oh my god. You gotta be kidding me. I still need to...
[10731.59s -> 10743.67s]  All right, give me the damn thing. Oh, what an eyesore. All right, I'm gonna tell you what I
[10743.67s -> 10747.91s]  would do if this is my house. Do you see? I would just take one of these panels and flip
[10747.91s -> 10771.54s]  it horizontal and cover the whole thing. Like, does it really matter? Bricks would be the wrong
[10771.54s -> 10777.70s]  way. The customer wouldn't even know. I would get away with that in a heartbeat.
[10786.87s -> 10790.39s]  What's going on up there? It looks like the bricks are the other way.
[10790.39s -> 10793.75s]  No, that's just the sun. Reflection from the sun. Is it an optical illusion?
[10797.05s -> 10800.41s]  That'd be a check, please. That's a check. I take checks only.
[10800.97s -> 10818.23s]  Actually, I'm just kidding. I take cash only. All right. Well, I can't do the thing I
[10818.23s -> 10825.77s]  wanted to do. What happened here? Is the grass growing through the rocks?
[10830.26s -> 10862.46s]  Why is that happening? What is going on here? There's nothing even there. All right, let's do
[10862.46s -> 10876.52s]  this. Can I just get bricks? I don't think I can do brick. I can... No, I can't.
[10877.24s -> 10913.48s]  Maybe this. That's kind of huge though. No, that's absurd. Let's see. Like,
[10915.14s -> 10949.98s]  stone. These ones. Herringbone. Oh, wait a minute. Okay, hold on. Nice. Hold on. No,
[10949.98s -> 10959.94s]  that's got to be a different color. They're huge, too. They're really big. Like, too big.
[10960.50s -> 10972.46s]  What we got in colors in here? These are just gold bars. No, that's very out of place.
[10972.46s -> 11018.06s]  That's better, but... Which way should it be facing? I would rent. Use bricks? There are
[11018.06s -> 11030.71s]  no bricks. I can't lay bricks down. It's only these. But look, it's like a stack of them.
[11032.22s -> 11073.77s]  That doesn't work. Look at this stuff. I can make it do stones. I can do this. This doesn't
[11073.77s -> 11111.19s]  look terrible. I feel like I should flip that. That just looks like this. Let me just see.
[11111.91s -> 11146.55s]  This needs to be a different color, then. That actually doesn't look bad. I don't hate this.
[11146.55s -> 11167.40s]  That doesn't look bad. Hold on here. This looks okay. Was it like this? A little bit over the edge?
[11168.76s -> 11180.58s]  Was it in a little bit more? That's not matching up. That's not matching up. I'm going to freak
[11180.58s -> 11191.85s]  out. I'm going to freak out. It's not matching up. It needs to be in a little more. It needs
[11191.85s -> 11219.00s]  to come in like a half an inch. Now, what do I do here? I can't just do that again. It'll
[11219.00s -> 11232.89s]  look awkward, won't it? No, I can't do this trick more than once. A couple of stones. Maybe
[11232.89s -> 11248.70s]  some rocks? Maybe some bigger stones? Like a plant bed, maybe? Let's see what looks like with
[11248.70s -> 11268.79s]  rocks. Okay, rock. No, I don't. What are you doing? Big stones? Stepping stone? Chopped? No.
[11268.79s -> 11275.26s]  Stepping stone? Chopped? Small? This is kind of an erratic pattern. How big is it? Oh,
[11275.26s -> 11306.47s]  bigger than ice crystals. Let's see what this looks like. Smaller and a little darker. Can
[11306.47s -> 11322.89s]  I make them? How about this one? Hold on. Wait. Hold on. This is important. Should I do
[11322.89s -> 11341.21s]  them spread out or should I have them kind of right in the line? No, that's ugly. I think I
[11341.21s -> 11372.89s]  need more stone. I need like something. I need pebble? Wait a minute. Why are these different
[11372.89s -> 11407.88s]  colors? Just put rocks all over the whole yard? I need like a flower bed. No, no, no.
[11407.88s -> 11436.30s]  Everybody, I got it. I'm going to just make a line of flowers. I wish this was even 20%
[11436.38s -> 11488.14s]  smaller. Poo. I think I can just hide it with a couple of little bushes. Twix bar. You guys,
[11488.14s -> 11493.26s]  it's so judgmental. Now I'm going to do some small bushes. A line of small bushes.
[11493.26s -> 11510.39s]  How big are these? Some orange? That might not look terrible. These are huge though.
[11510.39s -> 11524.17s]  I'll put one of these. Yeah, there are no cactuses in the game, unfortunately.
[11525.26s -> 11542.17s]  They do not exist. When these are in the ground. No, they need to be smaller. They're
[11542.25s -> 11600.60s]  too overbearing. I think I'm just going to say, fuck it. Here we go. Got it. Along the whole
[11600.60s -> 11618.76s]  thing. Let's just see how these look at first. Hold on. All right. Yeah, I'll take care of the
[11618.76s -> 11635.00s]  corner. I just want to make sure this looks all right. Yeah, this will be all right. Looks
[11635.00s -> 11657.67s]  better than the rocks. Yeah, it does. Yeah, that looks fine. No, that's bright enough here.
[11658.23s -> 11670.28s]  Leave the holes and see if anything else gets planted. Like, wow, my time off. It's like,
[11670.28s -> 11676.44s]  I'll see you later. I'm going to see what happens. I think I know. All right. And then
[11676.44s -> 11685.35s]  we're going to do one big bush here. One big bush here. Different bushes though. So the
[11685.35s -> 11693.78s]  symmetrical people that don't like the symmetrical stuff. You know, they'll have some say in this.
[11694.42s -> 11714.07s]  Spray hose and hose. Ah, we already did that yesterday. We did that joke already.
[11714.07s -> 11723.42s]  Just get rid of the shitty gravel. I like the gravel. I like the stone. I like it.
[11725.16s -> 11729.08s]  Once there's a bush over here and a bush over there, it'll look a lot nicer. I like it.
[11733.85s -> 11741.46s]  I like, um, stone. You don't like stone?
[11748.15s -> 11771.32s]  Raisins. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was for the guy that said to do that. All right. Hey,
[11772.42s -> 11780.17s]  look at that. We need something little right there. Something little right here.
[11781.94s -> 11786.74s]  Something big. Something big. And then we'll let the front door will be done. And we only
[11786.74s -> 11800.25s]  have like another fucking entire five acres to do. Okay. I'm going something big, large,
[11801.14s -> 11838.94s]  very large. Oh, fuck. Yeah. Oh, fucking hell. Yeah. I always did it. Oh, fucking hell. Yeah.
[11842.15s -> 11873.35s]  Look, we got up. We got down. It looks fucking dumb. LOL.
[11878.92s -> 11895.67s]  All right. Thanks. I think it looks cool. I'm not even done. You think I'm done.
[11895.67s -> 11905.06s]  I'm not even close to being done. Now we're going to get some more, uh, kind of like,
[11905.06s -> 11911.32s]  like almost pinkish, like, like in some way in between orange and, um, and red, right here,
[11912.36s -> 11924.95s]  right here, right here, right here. Let's go plants.
[11931.69s -> 11942.07s]  I wish I could change the color. Oh, I think so. Oh, I think so. These are the same color
[11942.07s -> 11968.04s]  of these. Damn it. Nevermind. Wait a minute. Oh no. Should I? Is this, is this too much?
[11968.68s -> 12039.54s]  This might be too much. This is too much. Too much. Is that too much? Too much. Yeah,
[12039.54s -> 12053.32s]  it is. Oh, you dickhead. Why? Now something has to go there. I'm almost done. Just need
[12053.32s -> 12059.69s]  little flower. Just something small. Something little. Something that really just brings it
[12059.69s -> 12067.93s]  all together. Like one of these. Get in there. Come on. Get right in there.
[12087.24s -> 12092.55s]  I might not even need it. I might not need it. I think I'm done with the front here.
[12092.55s -> 12113.42s]  I need to put something a little over there. Uh, what do I? I don't, I have no idea. These,
[12113.98s -> 12119.99s]  I don't, I don't know. I don't know what these are. Now that's too,
[12119.99s -> 12171.78s]  wait, hold on. I just got lost for a second. Hold on. Tree. Spherical tree. Plum tree.
[12172.42s -> 12183.03s]  Maybe one big tree on the right over here. Just a huge tree. A very big one. Like one
[12183.03s -> 12202.14s]  of these huge ones. Oh, that's enormous. No, that's a, that's a good giant pineapple in my house.
[12202.14s -> 12224.52s]  Small. It's got to be smaller than that. Here we go. That's better. Right here? That dumb tree
[12224.52s -> 12243.56s]  wasn't there. Start a riot. Our palm tree isn't here. Hey, relax. You already have one. No,
[12243.56s -> 12247.91s]  we need to have like a walkway going over here to the right. Yeah, there's nothing over here.
[12247.91s -> 12255.38s]  There's going to be like the walkway. Um, I don't know. No, this would be like a little,
[12255.38s -> 12264.28s]  little pool or something. I don't know. How about a rich person fountain? Something ridiculous,
[12264.28s -> 12279.94s]  like right here. A projector to the house. Outdoor cinema screen. A fire pit. That's go,
[12279.94s -> 12286.63s]  that goes in the back. No, Jeremy. No, that goes in the back. I'm sorry. Okay. Front,
[12286.63s -> 12295.70s]  I thought it was front yard. No, it's backyard. Okay. How about, um, playground,
[12295.70s -> 12308.57s]  but I don't have any kids. Swing center is very homey, but no, no kids. Recreation,
[12308.57s -> 12327.10s]  accessories, fire pits, hammocks, maybe. Back it up. Decorations. Japanese lantern.
[12327.74s -> 12366.18s]  Which do you prefer? On the outside or on right on the, on the inside or in the gravel here?
[12366.18s -> 12376.84s]  Number one, number two or number three? That'll give you a good view. I'm seeing a lot of
[12376.84s -> 12396.18s]  threes. That's all right. Looks like it's going to be three. How many, how many steps?
[12397.37s -> 12423.82s]  Like here? One, two, three, four, five or four? You're going to want to fucking come to my
[12423.82s -> 12451.62s]  house. Uneven, uneven. Fuck. You don't want to come to my smelly house? There's nothing in here
[12451.62s -> 12462.62s]  yet. It doesn't, how could you tell it smells like anything? Come on game. What are you doing?
[12462.62s -> 12490.23s]  Why can I not play? Am I standing on it? Huh? Straight down. There we go. I can just do it
[12490.23s -> 12498.02s]  like that. Everyone's going to want to come to my house. I can already just see the invitations
[12498.02s -> 12529.43s]  I send out. BYOB. God damn it. This is wrong. Um, it's not wrong. Which one of these is wrong?
[12529.43s -> 12565.18s]  This one? That's that one. It's these two. How do I turn them on? Yeah. Oh, I'm so fucking happy.
[12565.18s -> 12583.99s]  I actually don't mind this, but it needs to move. This, this tree right here is really
[12583.99s -> 12589.45s]  fucking it all up. You know what I mean? This doesn't look right because of the tree.
[12594.23s -> 12605.80s]  It looks better. Your front lawn is going to have so many bugs. Unfortunately, I have to
[12605.80s -> 12619.96s]  patch that up. So the thing is you're missing pizza ovens. This is the one, right? No,
[12619.96s -> 12630.87s]  it's bigger stone. Wait, that is the big one. Why does this look so odd? Oh, there we go.
[12630.87s -> 12636.31s]  We're good. Any of the little patches I need to do? Maybe come out a little too,
[12636.31s -> 12642.47s]  just like to make it so it's more natural here. Right on the edge. Maybe have this
[12642.47s -> 12650.58s]  come out here a little more. Like here and then go out and around. Hear me out.
[12652.06s -> 12710.82s]  I fucked it up. Saved it. No, I didn't. Fuck. Can I crouch? No, why? Oh, god damn it. Well,
[12710.82s -> 12730.41s]  whatever. At least I can clean it up now. That looks natural now. Yeah, and then I
[12730.41s -> 12734.55s]  can just put that one here and hide the bullshit that I just did. What was the name
[12734.55s -> 12741.61s]  of this thing? What are these called? I forget. Go back up into the sky. That was funny.
[12743.75s -> 12751.43s]  What were those things called? These? What were they? No, I have like a palm tree garden in the
[12751.43s -> 12787.53s]  back. Anyone remember what those were called? What were those called? You had to plant them,
[12787.53s -> 12793.93s]  right? What were those things called? Not these. I think it was at the top. I think
[12793.93s -> 12810.52s]  I had it already. Spring? Damn it. What the hell are these called? Spreading bush?
[12814.06s -> 12822.18s]  You got it. I think that's the one, right? Yeah, this is correct. Let's get this in a good spot,
[12822.18s -> 12845.90s]  though. I'm thinking like right here. There. These are like not even. There's like a little
[12845.90s -> 12858.90s]  too much space here. This is a retirement drug den. That's not the same thing. That's not
[12858.90s -> 12868.38s]  even the same bush. That is not correct. And it looks very close. Is it? Is that the same
[12868.38s -> 12888.97s]  thing? No, this one's not the same thing. This is called Acer palmatum. Is there another color?
[12890.25s -> 12915.77s]  It is this one. All right. Now that we have the front front pretty much done,
[12916.41s -> 12925.74s]  I would call this is pretty close to like nice garden, dude. I need something right here,
[12925.74s -> 12933.85s]  though. Like nice job, man, is what I would say to the person that made this if they were
[12933.85s -> 12955.94s]  in the ninth grade. Columns? Pond. That would be good, yeah. One of these ones. Let's make it
[12955.94s -> 12967.77s]  a good color. Which way? Facing how? Facing around the tree, I think. That would be kind
[12967.77s -> 12975.58s]  of nice, right? And maybe put something next to it. It's a hot tub. This is not a hot tub.
[12977.75s -> 12984.23s]  I think right up here against this tree. And if you don't like it, you can just go watch
[12984.23s -> 13000.12s]  another stream. You know what I'm saying? How long is it going to take to dig? All right,
[13000.12s -> 13016.38s]  then. Making a skate park? Oh, you actually have to fill it with water? I thought it was rain. The
[13016.38s -> 13026.22s]  pond was mounted and filled. Just kidding. All right. Now this is bad because this needs to be
[13026.22s -> 13034.10s]  like bigger. There needs to be something around it. This is how it starts. Now I know what
[13034.10s -> 13043.50s]  gardening is like. Now the tree fucked it all up. It needs to be bigger. I'm going to do
[13043.50s -> 13065.21s]  the big one. Dude, if that fucking tree wasn't here. If that tree wasn't here, this is
[13065.21s -> 13077.37s]  perfect. I can go this way. Yeah, but I don't want to put it here, though. People will drive
[13077.37s -> 13082.58s]  by and throw cigarette butts in here. You know how many baseballs are going to go in here?
[13082.58s -> 13097.85s]  It can't be this close. No, it's got to be the smaller ones. Um, there's this one,
[13097.85s -> 13115.91s]  though. What does this one look like? This one's okay. It's cool looking. Yeah.
[13120.22s -> 13127.27s]  Shit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do not go into here. Remove, please. Please
[13127.27s -> 13145.00s]  remove. Cancel. Cancel, please. I just want something to like be right here or something.
[13145.00s -> 13158.92s]  Hold on. How's that look? Could put something right here. Let me just see what it looks like.
[13162.31s -> 13184.55s]  Yeah, I can't delete the tree. It's there forever. That's not bad. Wait a second. Wait
[13184.55s -> 13213.85s]  a minute. Oh, this is just, hold on. Can I? Can you connect them? No, you can't connect
[13213.85s -> 13221.14s]  them. It's going to be right here. I'll put like another fucking tree or bush over here.
[13221.94s -> 13230.49s]  That's okay. I'm okay with that. We'll put like a little something. I need like enough
[13230.49s -> 13253.05s]  space to walk this way though. That is enough room. All right. Um, what do I, what goes over
[13253.05s -> 13258.09s]  here? How about a big, huge pond like right here? No, that's too much. That's even more pond than
[13258.09s -> 13279.37s]  house. Uh, do, do more pond. A huge fountain. Paris fountain. I'm going to put a couple of
[13279.37s -> 13287.40s]  little shrubs like here and like one here and here. Um, can we get like a preliminary
[13287.40s -> 13303.94s]  screenshot here? Just real quick. That looks pretty nice. Something nice. Something cool.
[13303.94s -> 13314.82s]  Something interesting. Something daring. A giant gnome. I'll put him here. He belongs over here
[13319.83s -> 13333.56s]  in the pool, in the water. There's a little spot back here. That's cute right here. Yeah,
[13333.56s -> 13400.02s]  I think so. Sculptures. Wait a minute. You can sit on the rocks. You can sit down on the
[13400.02s -> 13416.28s]  rock. Just chill. Hold on. Move this one a little bit over here. Put something right in the middle.
[13416.28s -> 13445.78s]  Got a little seat rock. What do you mean no one will do that? You wouldn't sit on that?
[13445.78s -> 13487.46s]  They're drinking out of the pond. Put a god damn tire swing. Hold on. By the way,
[13487.46s -> 13499.00s]  half the shit's gonna get stolen. Someone's gonna walk up here and just fucking take these.
[13499.00s -> 13502.52s]  That's why I would never have like something like this. Someone would just reach over
[13502.52s -> 13516.22s]  the fence and take it and walk away. Need to get a juped up security system. This is so
[13516.22s -> 13522.15s]  cute. Look at how nice this looks. Look at that. Don't take a picture yet.
[13529.21s -> 13536.90s]  That doesn't look good. That was like your mother came over to give her a tour of your new place
[13537.54s -> 13542.81s]  and everything looks so nice and pretty and you cleaned up but for some reason something,
[13542.81s -> 13548.73s]  a coin drops on the ground and it rolls underneath the couch and you have the panic
[13548.73s -> 13557.59s]  attack where she's gonna look under the couch and she's like oh let me get that coin. No,
[13557.59s -> 13561.75s]  don't. I'll get it and you try to race her to get the coin. Everything's in slow motion
[13561.75s -> 13565.35s]  and she finds all the dirt that you sweep under the couch because you don't feel like
[13565.35s -> 13581.93s]  putting it in the trash and all the porn DVDs that you sweep under the couch.
[13582.49s -> 13610.31s]  I could make a whole D&D game. Pour out the water. Like the birds are fine. Can I paint
[13610.31s -> 13615.58s]  them? I think the front yard is done. I do. Maybe we'll come back and clean it up a little bit.
[13618.20s -> 13628.92s]  Wait, most importantly, come on. Looks like a welcome mat. This is the worst game on Steam.
[13630.01s -> 13648.68s]  I think so. All right. Furniture. Wait a minute. Just a mat. Wait. Look at these.
[13649.48s -> 13669.90s]  Come on. You tell me I'm not gonna have these too. That's in the way. Something's
[13669.90s -> 13679.94s]  gonna be like right here. It's looking a little too busy. Is it? You think so? Yeah,
[13679.94s -> 13683.54s]  you know, it is getting a little busy. It's getting busy. It's getting a little too busy.
[13684.34s -> 13691.03s]  You are right. Yeah, this is getting busy. This is getting very busy. Yeah,
[13691.03s -> 13698.49s]  this is becoming, this is becoming a hotel lobby busy. All right. Yeah, hold on.
[13698.49s -> 13720.79s]  Too many rocks. I like them. I like them. I really do. I really do like these. I like
[13720.79s -> 13755.74s]  them a lot. Did I move, did I fuck it up by moving that? Maybe. No, put it back. No, no.
[13755.74s -> 13765.37s]  Doesn't work. No, you can sit over here. So what do we got on this side? Oh, Jesus. I don't want to
[13765.37s -> 13770.86s]  look at that. All my fucking socks and my dirt and my porn DVDs. No, I only want my mother to
[13770.86s -> 13786.47s]  see the hotel lobby. It's a dump back there. Yeah, right now it is. Look at how much work
[13786.47s -> 13798.98s]  there is to do. The stream's never gonna turn off. It's all right, guys. I, I ate sardines
[13798.98s -> 13807.86s]  today. They actually get, they literally, literally give you superpowers. They think I'm
[13807.86s -> 13814.81s]  making that up. That's not a joke. I'm not making a joke. They actually give you superpowers. It's
[13814.81s -> 13844.49s]  real. Start eating them. I'm serious. Mole? No, that's not a mole. Where's the mole? Is these
[13844.49s -> 13868.44s]  mole tracks? All mole mounds are gone. Mole's gone. Mole's gone. We're fine. It is so easy
[13868.44s -> 13878.02s]  to eat too. I would take a sardine sponsorship. I probably would. The only sponsorship you
[13878.02s -> 13895.93s]  would ever see on this channel would be for like sardine cans. Ever have them on crackers?
[13895.93s -> 13899.13s]  I have not. I've had it on toast though. Wow, that's what a great idea. I can't wait to do that
[13899.13s -> 13916.87s]  tomorrow. Streamer ate sardines once and is now hooked for life. Like today. They give you
[13916.87s -> 13926.31s]  superpowers. I had them today. What a placebo effect. I could do anything. I think I could,
[13926.31s -> 13933.19s]  I think I could probably fly. Do not get up there. No, I had sardines today, man. I
[13933.43s -> 13983.11s]  think I can do it. You versus the guy she told you not to care about. He's losing it. It was
[13983.11s -> 13990.54s]  already gone before you got here. Don't worry. What else? There's a lot of weeds over here.
[13991.18s -> 14013.70s]  It's hard to get around these trees. Speaking of trees, why can I sell these ones but I
[14013.70s -> 14038.66s]  can't get rid of the huge annoying ones that are all over the place in the ground? Well,
[14038.66s -> 14053.13s]  it's almost clean and mowed almost. Do a sardine review? I already did. I've been doing it every
[14053.13s -> 14075.29s]  hour. I've already done that. Let's make this side of a house a swamp. What brand do I get?
[14077.64s -> 14092.06s]  The one with the guy that looks like Dr. Roker. Yes, somebody did say that. Why would
[14092.06s -> 14105.42s]  I even say that? We're 100% clean as of right... No, not yet. Hold on. Hold that
[14105.42s -> 14127.93s]  thought. You have to eat a sardine and show your superpowers. Are these dog bowls considered...
[14128.49s -> 14139.42s]  Is this considered dirty? I know. You just deleted the dog house. The dog house.
[14140.22s -> 14145.93s]  What about the dog? Don't worry. I knew it. I told you. I'm just going to put down
[14145.93s -> 14153.58s]  grass here and put the dog park back. I knew that was going to happen. You can't ever
[14153.74s -> 14169.27s]  delete a dog house on stream. Yes. Yeah, I think so. I do. It needs a door. That's what's missing.
[14180.66s -> 14250.02s]  White? Why is this so fat? This doesn't look right. Why is this too big? Hey, and then that...
[14250.02s -> 14272.06s]  Hold on. It's not done yet. Stop screaming at me. It's not done. I can't do that.
[14272.94s -> 14300.73s]  Now it's a home. Except for the left, back, and right side of the house.
[14301.37s -> 14310.26s]  What am I gonna do over here? I gotta have something fun over here. Definitely gonna have
[14310.26s -> 14319.61s]  like a barbecue section. Do a roller coaster. Make the dog park. I could have a little dog
[14319.61s -> 14324.25s]  park over here. Yeah, I'll have like a little separate dog place. Hold on. There's definitely
[14324.25s -> 14371.05s]  trash everywhere in here. Is there a car? The house comes with a car. I just want a car
[14371.05s -> 14388.66s]  in here. They got a pool table? They got a ball pit. That's too small. All right. One step at a
[14388.66s -> 14402.71s]  time. I need to do the rest of the paneling in the house. I gotta fix this dumb, stupid idea
[14402.71s -> 14418.38s]  that I had and I should be reprimanded for it. What the hell was this called? It was a panel.
[14434.42s -> 14447.22s]  We must riot for a ball pit. You want me to put a ball pit in the garage? Now I know the
[14447.22s -> 14456.04s]  scaffold. I know, I know. I'm just gonna do the bottom first. This doesn't look right. Yeah,
[14456.04s -> 14472.70s]  it's the same one. This place isn't even dirty. I bet the outside was, but thankfully the inside
[14472.70s -> 14483.94s]  is nice. We can do some decorating. We can have, look, the outside, I'll make a separate
[14483.94s -> 14492.04s]  little circus area. Everything's gonna be fine. I'm telling you, this is the big house. This
[14492.04s -> 14499.93s]  is the one to go all in. I went all in. This stream will not stop until it's all done.
[14500.01s -> 14509.05s]  All in. I, I'm going all in at the fucking table, dude. I've got 36 bucks at that table.
[14509.69s -> 14514.73s]  All in. Everybody at the table is gonna be like, oh that's a lot. What the hell is he thinking?
[14515.45s -> 14545.35s]  You and your gambling fantasies. You know, I mean, dude, I was thinking,
[14545.99s -> 14552.31s]  I'm thinking I'm getting a tat. Seven on one eyelid, seven on the other eyelid,
[14553.11s -> 14559.11s]  and seven on the top of my tongue. So I'll just close my eyes, stick my tongue out and
[14559.11s -> 14587.58s]  be like, ding, ding, ding, motherfucker. I mean, the efficiency is just off the fucking charts
[14587.58s -> 14595.19s]  right now. You can tell that there was some type of fish based nutrients that he took today.
[14596.07s -> 14616.07s]  This is fucking up the grass though. That's annoying.
[14625.78s -> 14634.14s]  Tiles look weird. You should do brick or stucco. Um, I think it may be far too late
[14634.14s -> 14638.78s]  to change this now. These aren't tiles. They're panels. They're wall panels.
[14639.50s -> 14654.97s]  Are these tiles in this wall panel? These aren't bathroom tiles. Yeah, just these are pine panels.
[14655.53s -> 14661.37s]  Yeah, this is fine. I'm not doing this again. This is like a long time. It takes a while to
[14661.37s -> 14673.06s]  do this. Damn it. I know people are gonna give me shit for doing the double dare technique,
[14674.10s -> 14677.86s]  and it's like running back and forth, placing, run back over here, get some more milk,
[14677.86s -> 14683.88s]  run over here, put it inside their hat with the eggs. I know, but I'm just trying to get
[14683.88s -> 14702.25s]  this done. Still on this house. I'll be on this house until the stream turns off. That is a fact.
[14703.05s -> 14714.60s]  I mean, that is 100% truth, but it's going to be the greatest thing I've ever done in this game.
[14715.32s -> 14719.26s]  It's going to be really well done. We're not going to put like a Best Buy in here.
[14720.06s -> 14725.43s]  It's going to be a beautiful, fantastic, actually made house with a wonderful garden,
[14725.43s -> 14730.87s]  wonderful backyard play area, patio with a barbecue, a small circus, not a big one,
[14730.87s -> 14739.22s]  a small circus, a dog park, and maybe a gym. It's going to be a fun, it's going to be a regular
[14739.22s -> 14769.43s]  just house. All right, slow down. I'm going too fast. Still going to make a hot topic?
[14771.19s -> 14791.26s]  No, not this time. Okay, almost getting there. Phew! It's hard work. It's hard work pretending
[14791.26s -> 14812.97s]  to do hard work. Don't you guys think? Now we need this scaffolding after this,
[14812.97s -> 14819.03s]  and it could be the other side too. This house is too big. How many rooms are in this house?
[14819.75s -> 14826.01s]  Look at this. What is this all for? Why is there brick over here? Okay, so this,
[14826.01s -> 14831.05s]  what is this supposed to be? What is this room? Here's the front door. Got a nice garden,
[14831.05s -> 14841.88s]  but you know, okay, front door, the closet, the den, the closet where you hang your coats
[14841.88s -> 14849.90s]  and shoe rack or I don't know. And then this looks like it could just be a big living room.
[14849.90s -> 14859.61s]  Now what is this? Second weird brick room. This is not a bedroom. Bathroom? What would
[14859.61s -> 14868.14s]  he, what the hell would, why would there be brick? All right, up here. This house sucks.
[14869.10s -> 14881.32s]  There's no rooms. It's just, there's two brick rooms. I'm going to have to build out some
[14881.32s -> 14894.12s]  bedrooms. You build the room, smart guy. Yeah, but this, what, look at the weird layout here.
[14894.12s -> 14901.83s]  Everybody has a balcony? Up the stairs, balcony. Whose balcony is this? Just a balcony. And then
[14901.83s -> 14916.20s]  there's another balcony. You got too many balconies. I want to in fact remove this balcony
[14916.92s -> 14927.19s]  and turn it into a circus. That's more normal than this. Now front balconies, I, no, I don't
[14927.19s -> 14938.33s]  think so. No front balcony. Don't think so. No, no, no, no, no, no. This is how you get sniped in
[14938.33s -> 14962.94s]  Hitman. I, nope. We can make it work. I'll make it work. Don't worry. Yeah, that's where like the
[14962.94s -> 14969.51s]  target comes and smokes a cigarette for 15 seconds and that's your opportunity. All right,
[14969.51s -> 14987.18s]  what were we doing over here? Your power's been off for two hours. That's not good.
[14990.70s -> 14995.18s]  Oh, let's get a reveal. Hold on. I need to get a big reveal. Somebody just came back after
[14995.18s -> 15002.28s]  two hours. They weren't here. You ready for this? Okay. That one person that's here, you
[15002.28s -> 15007.40s]  ready? They just came back. Take a look at this. You remember what it looked like before,
[15007.40s -> 15024.46s]  before you left. Take a look at it now. And it's not even done. There's still much to be done.
[15030.76s -> 15041.75s]  Ah, I love it. All right, for real, I left when you were doing the Jenga thing. I came back and
[15041.75s -> 15051.98s]  it looks great. See? Yeah, thank you. Yes. Ah, welcome back. Hopefully the power situation.
[15053.58s -> 15070.92s]  So, under control. Yeah, we're gonna do something fun over here. We're gonna do like
[15071.48s -> 15091.24s]  a circus maybe. That's a paid actor. We should build something. Build Jenga. Wait a minute.
[15091.24s -> 15127.51s]  Is there actual drop in the game? No, they're not the same pieces. They can't fit. It has
[15127.51s -> 15148.86s]  to be two. It's not real Jenga. Unless there's three. Yeah, sorry guys. It's not real. It'll
[15148.86s -> 15155.24s]  never be real. Well, let's just see what happens. Well, there is no drop. What am
[15155.24s -> 15175.50s]  I talking about? One floated in the air for like 35 minutes. How do you play Jenga with
[15175.50s -> 15201.18s]  two rows? Yeah, you don't. That's what I'm saying. The panels can drop. Does it reach?
[15201.18s -> 15209.00s]  Can't stack them though. I don't think they can be stacked on top of each other.
[15209.00s -> 15222.79s]  No, sorry. Theory busted. Paint the top half of the house. That would look pretty odd.
[15240.62s -> 15252.55s]  Two-toned house. How's the um, how's the internet been? Looks like I haven't
[15252.55s -> 15258.66s]  dropped very many frames. I mean, I still have, but I've dropped like 3,500? Seems
[15258.66s -> 15266.86s]  like it's all right. At least for today. Maybe um, maybe it's more manageable now that we have the
[15267.42s -> 15273.54s]  new DNS and new static IP. Well, that would be really swell if that were the case.
[15276.42s -> 15281.11s]  No, I said it. Now it's gonna happen. I know, right? All right. Uh, I need
[15281.83s -> 15296.71s]  to put this away. I need a scaffolding. Let me buy a few of these. No, let's just get it.
[15296.71s -> 15304.62s]  Let's just get this actually ready to be done in one go. Don't paint the top half. Wait,
[15305.34s -> 15308.86s]  why do you think I'm gonna paint the top half? Just because somebody in chat said that?
[15310.87s -> 15324.74s]  What? I'm not gonna paint the top half. I do that a lot. Not today. Today's different.
[15334.07s -> 15372.01s]  I need more of these panels. No. Please fall. If there's no fall damage though,
[15372.01s -> 15376.86s]  so it wouldn't matter. I could fall right now and we could just like laugh hysterically
[15376.86s -> 15383.18s]  about me falling. Wouldn't really do anything. I'm sorry. I know that could be disappointing.
[15384.46s -> 15392.95s]  There's no funny health meter where I could die and, you know what I mean? I know everybody's
[15392.95s -> 15410.30s]  expecting it to happen, but it's not gonna do it. Sorry. Wait, there's more here? Why can
[15410.30s -> 15437.21s]  I not? I'm not close enough to get these. That's not possible, man. Come on. Well,
[15437.21s -> 15446.76s]  I have to move the scaffolding again. I mean, this is just like doing the
[15447.48s -> 15462.90s]  grass. It's tedious, but once you do it, it's over. And you end up in a magazine. Gardener Weekly.
[15477.50s -> 15510.18s]  Come on. That's such bullshit. Just move. Is it these things in the way? All right. Dude,
[15510.18s -> 15532.68s]  how the fuck? That's even further away. I'm just gonna have to jump. Did I not get it?
[15540.30s -> 15556.44s]  Okay. Cool. Cool. Very cool. Nice. Check around for bald spots. We have a few bald spots over here
[15556.44s -> 15563.82s]  that I'm gonna take care of. So I just sit back and relax while I take care of these walls.
[15579.75s -> 15599.58s]  And go. Come on, fill up that bucket. Come on, Anderson family. Okay, that's it. How many
[15599.58s -> 15606.79s]  panels did you get up? God damn it. There's an entire side of the fucking house.
[15611.64s -> 15647.62s]  I just got insane deja vu right now. Right here. Why? Did I miss one up here? No, I got it. I'm good.
[15647.62s -> 15662.50s]  Is this though? Oh, that was gonna be just barely a perfect exact number. And it wasn't. Oh,
[15662.50s -> 15674.38s]  this is gonna take so long. I can do that when I go upstairs. I gotta bring this over here.
[15674.38s -> 15696.22s]  Too much paneling. I'm gonna do the inside and the lawn on the house. Oh, I'm prepared.
[15696.22s -> 15707.77s]  I am very prepared for it. Wake up. Wake up. Painting it so much quicker is sandstone
[15708.65s -> 15718.78s]  cocky and just roll all of that shit on. Yeah, but it would look pretty ugly. It would be that
[15718.78s -> 15730.22s]  one weird solid color. It would just look like a cartoon house. This won't be much longer.
[15730.22s -> 15735.08s]  See, right now some of you guys are like, oh, we're just chilling out? No. Okay. All right.
[15735.08s -> 15760.87s]  Some of you guys got like dinner. Like eating right now. So we have plenty of time. I had
[15760.87s -> 15767.94s]  dinner already. What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do for dinner? That's a really,
[15767.94s -> 15781.30s]  really interesting question. It's gotta be something I can eat fast because I plan on
[15781.30s -> 15791.90s]  going for a lot longer than this. I need one more panel. Are you kidding me? Grilled cheese.
[15791.90s -> 15815.19s]  That doesn't sound bad. Bingo. Still have to do over there, but I do have the scaffolding
[15815.19s -> 15820.84s]  here I can bring over. All right. Looks all right. What have we got? Two? I had two. How
[15821.80s -> 15831.94s]  I just like rage bought all these. Grilled cheese and tomato soup. That sounds pretty easy.
[15832.58s -> 15849.88s]  Sounds pretty quick too. I'm not sure we have that here though.
[15852.94s -> 15861.14s]  Need to go to the grocery store. It's been a while. Pick up some essentials like cheese
[15862.31s -> 15878.95s]  and tomato soup. All essential things to have in your household. Got it. All right. Let's do
[15878.95s -> 15893.72s]  this too. Can I reach from here? No, I can't. How am I doing on money? Oh yeah, that's right. I
[15893.72s -> 15903.91s]  bought and sold this stupid home alone house for like $600,000. All right. What do you guys think
[15903.91s -> 15928.50s]  is the fastest way to make $500,000? Legally. Legally. The lottery? I said fastest. You could
[15928.50s -> 15935.64s]  play the lottery for like 50 years and not win. Like what is a guaranteed way to make
[15935.64s -> 15952.25s]  $500,000 in like a year? If anybody knew that everybody would just do it. Play Fortnite. Be a
[15952.25s -> 15964.23s]  Fortnite player? Is it? It's not that easy. Is it? There's a lot of people that play Fortnite
[15964.23s -> 15975.40s]  and some a lot of them aren't like 500,000 dares. There's a lot of people that play that
[15975.40s -> 16003.21s]  game. Get out of the way. I'm just gonna jump. Write an AI. Like code an AI. Work a $50,000 a
[16003.21s -> 16013.13s]  year job, but 10 times. Like so to have $10,000, $50,000 a year jobs at the same time. Okay.
[16027.94s -> 16042.38s]  Work a $500,000 a year job with an IQ thing. Win the German rumble 5,600 times. I don't do
[16042.38s -> 16057.78s]  that many in a year though. Coming together. Okay. So you could work for a year and get
[16058.34s -> 16066.89s]  $50,000. Go to the casino and put it on red 10 times. No, double it up so you get $100,000
[16066.89s -> 16072.89s]  and then put it on black $200,000. Put it on black $400,000. Put it on red $800,000.
[16073.61s -> 16087.19s]  And then you leave. You get your $400,000. Ask $500,000 people for $1 and lose everything.
[16087.83s -> 16098.02s]  Now do not do that. That is very bad advice. Get good at Jeopardy. Now that's a good idea.
[16099.29s -> 16107.85s]  That's thinking with your head. Get really good at a game show and then go win the game show.
[16108.49s -> 16128.90s]  Write a Star Wars movie, but you have to get hired to do the Star Wars movie. You don't
[16128.90s -> 16147.38s]  have to get hired to... there's $500,000 right there. Uh, no, but seriously that was 50 bucks.
[16148.50s -> 16166.06s]  5,000 vids from VoidSpace123. Thank you VoidSpace. And VoidSpace says,
[16166.70s -> 16170.36s]  Hey Jeremy, just wanted to give some appreciation for all you've done for me
[16170.36s -> 16173.96s]  over the years. If in times of your streams the only thing keeping me going and words cannot
[16173.96s -> 16180.22s]  describe how you've impacted me positively. Love you, man. Keep doing what you're doing.
[16180.22s -> 16188.02s]  I'm gonna keep doing it. Thank you so much for the 50 fucking dollars and
[16188.74s -> 16199.24s]  the incredibly kind message. Thank you, VoidSpace. I need more of these. 50 bucks is a
[16199.24s -> 16220.82s]  lot of money. It is to give somebody on the internet. So, and if I can impact you
[16220.82s -> 16226.81s]  positively, that's great. I'm very glad I do. I would hate to negatively impact somebody,
[16227.53s -> 16248.10s]  so I'm glad to hear that. Oh no, why is this happening? Okay, I just have to squeeze it in.
[16260.30s -> 16268.15s]  Almost done with the paneling. Ah, it's so close to not having to do it anymore. I'm so
[16268.15s -> 16277.38s]  happy. Ah, that's it, right? All right, now redo it. I don't like the color, Jeremy.
[16277.38s -> 16287.96s]  Let's just make sure. Is this really not a bit? No. What, you thought the whole,
[16287.96s -> 16309.56s]  this whole thing was a joke? Uh, no. Wait, wait, wait. Is it the family guy house?
[16311.64s -> 16323.59s]  It is not the family guy. Let me look this up. It's not. Family guy, that family guy house
[16323.59s -> 16350.62s]  is white. It is. The roof is also the same. Should I make a red door? No,
[16350.62s -> 16370.97s]  I don't want to have a family guy house. No. You can't even have a red door. There is no
[16370.97s -> 16399.38s]  red door. This is a refrigerator. Fucking family guy house. Why? You can change the door color?
[16400.10s -> 16429.14s]  You can? Internal door. Front door. You can't change the color. Paint the door. You can
[16429.14s -> 16468.66s]  paint the door? No, you can't. You can't paint the door. Got him. Yeah, I mean,
[16469.94s -> 16479.11s]  you can't paint the door. All right, I can't believe it's a family guy house.
[16479.11s -> 16484.38s]  And even the top is like green, isn't it? I think the top is this weird
[16485.02s -> 16496.34s]  off green kind of gray. I can't, I, I can't even look at the house now.
[16497.37s -> 16514.47s]  I seriously can't look at it. It's all right. No, no mini golf. I'm sticking through this. I
[16514.47s -> 16532.34s]  don't care if I have the family guy. Fuck. I hate this. No. Second floor. I know I'm going
[16532.34s -> 16549.93s]  out there. I'm going out there to finish my family guy house. Fuck. Whatever. Oh, sorry.
[16549.93s -> 16557.37s]  It's my other balcony. It's my other balcony I have on the other side.
[16559.45s -> 16577.27s]  We have three balconies. Hey Peter, do you remember the time that we built that house?
[16578.07s -> 16616.87s]  Yeah, it's my house, Joe. And this is the whole episode. Hey Quagmire, can you pull the
[16616.95s -> 16626.79s]  car in the garage? Okay. Sure thing. I do that all the time. Oh, you're all about sex, aren't you
[16626.79s -> 16670.57s]  Quagmire? This is like kind of cringe. No, it wasn't shut up. What are you talking about?
[16671.13s -> 16683.00s]  No, it wasn't shut up. What are you talking about? Don't say that. What are you talking
[16683.00s -> 16694.82s]  about? My Peter Griffin was like pretty good. I thought my friends told me. All right. Is
[16694.82s -> 16723.22s]  everything done? I think that's it. I can't paint the window frames. It doesn't work.
[16723.22s -> 16729.02s]  The garage. Should the garage be different? I don't think I want the garage to have these
[16729.02s -> 16759.56s]  same panels. Maybe like a... what's wrong with the front door? Well, it's kind of fucked up.
[16759.56s -> 16796.46s]  And in there? That's fine. Play the family guy theme. No, I'm not going to do that.
[16798.62s -> 16802.14s]  If anything, do you want me to do like this loud voice crack Peter Griffin
[16802.14s -> 16807.46s]  laugh? I mean, I'll do that again. When you start to get like a little rambunctious.
[16808.10s -> 16818.62s]  All right, I want something different out here. Add doors to the house. Hold on, hold on.
[16818.62s -> 16833.40s]  I feel bad for the people that I turn away. Stop writing the things that you're
[16833.40s -> 16837.42s]  saying. That's not the problem. It was nothing to do with being tired.
[16837.42s -> 16856.46s]  Oh, there is a doormat right here. All right. I need some sliders. I need a few of them.
[16856.46s -> 16890.17s]  That one. I might change this. Okay. What are you guys doing? Why are you
[16890.17s -> 16919.10s]  doing that cringey thing in chat right now? Is there something cringey going on in here?
[16919.10s -> 16925.27s]  All right. In turn, let's do... I don't want to put the doors. I'll put some placeholder
[16925.27s -> 16930.84s]  doors. I'll put some $246 placeholders because I don't know what the color in the paint and
[16930.84s -> 16939.40s]  stuff is going to be in here. Anybody have a clip of me doing that? I want to see what it
[16939.40s -> 16944.94s]  sounded like. I'm going to mute the audio though. That's just for me. I want to hear it.
[16952.57s -> 16967.91s]  Make that the front door. No, that's fine. Place the fridge on the front lawn and it'll
[16967.91s -> 16985.54s]  be a true Vegas house. Fridge on the front lawn. What does that mean? Nobody has a clip
[16985.54s -> 16997.11s]  of that. No one saved that. How many people are here? There are 3,652. There are 3,600
[16997.11s -> 17001.59s]  fucking people here. No one fucking clipped it. They must have hated it. You guys must
[17001.59s -> 17009.90s]  have hated that. Is this it? Okay. Here's a clip of it. This clip has one view and it's
[17009.90s -> 17017.99s]  me. Somebody had to go back and clip this because it was so... They hated it so much.
[17021.62s -> 17044.63s]  Hold on. I'm muting. I want to hear this. It's not that bad. Why did everybody hate
[17044.63s -> 17055.37s]  that so much? What was wrong with that? I thought that was pretty good.
[17074.82s -> 17096.54s]  I won't put you through that. Don't ever do that again.
[17097.34s -> 17107.96s]  All right. Let's go like this. Move office here? No. The internet here sucks. I have
[17107.96s -> 17112.28s]  to move to my office. This is pissing me off though. Seriously. How do I fix this?
[17113.08s -> 17124.01s]  You know what I'm saying? Like, why is it like this? What's... Why do I have Tetris
[17124.01s -> 17136.06s]  pieces in my front lawn? This is... Recreate the Family Guy interior. That would be
[17136.06s -> 17142.28s]  committing so hard to something. That was never supposed to be that. First it was
[17142.28s -> 17157.96s]  mini golf. Now it's a one-to-one internal Family Guy house. No. That's gonna be worse
[17157.96s -> 17165.03s]  noise of 2019. I already know it. I don't even need to do any more noises ever again.
[17169.26s -> 17188.49s]  All right. I want... Let's get the grass rolled out here. Family Golf. What do I need? The
[17188.49s -> 17205.96s]  turf. All right. There's some turf here. It looks like shit. I gotta go this way.
[17206.76s -> 17213.22s]  I'm trying to write an essay. Can you stop streaming? Yeah. Thanks for coming out
[17213.22s -> 17217.14s]  everybody. Does somebody making an essay don't want to like fuck up this cool thing? So
[17222.84s -> 17225.24s]  I should be careful doing that because I wonder how many people what like the
[17225.24s -> 17230.92s]  percentage of people that just click off the stream when that slide comes up. It's probably
[17230.92s -> 17263.64s]  pretty high. I'm just gonna buy it. Look, you know what? Okay. I actually kind of like this.
[17265.62s -> 17277.88s]  Maybe I'll keep a couple stacks. All right. Let's go back here. Get it lined up. It's a farm.
[17278.76s -> 17283.16s]  Why did I do that? I did it because I was sick of going into the menu and buying them.
[17283.80s -> 17298.63s]  So I'm gonna just use these and not have to buy them. See? They just... Right here. Done. Go.
[17298.63s -> 17315.50s]  Roll. It doesn't matter. It could be uneven. I have a ton of them. Wait. This is the driveway.
[17316.14s -> 17319.18s]  Hold on. Yeah. Fuck it. Go for it. That's driveway.
[17329.03s -> 17333.11s]  He's still on the lawn. No. Did you? Wait. Wait. Somebody just came in. There's a big reveal.
[17333.11s -> 17336.94s]  Ready? You saw what looked up before. Yeah. He's still on the lawn. Just what? Not the
[17336.94s -> 17357.59s]  lawn anymore. Ready? One. Two. Take a look now. See? All right. So then from here
[17357.59s -> 17367.96s]  to here needs to be a driveway. This is... No. Why would you do it like this? This is too...
[17368.68s -> 17373.24s]  This is a huge driveway. This is like... The whole side yard is gonna be a driveway.
[17373.88s -> 17389.54s]  The driveway comes to the... It hits the side of the house. This is too much driveway. This
[17389.54s -> 17396.39s]  is more driveway than any yard. What I'm gonna have to do is I'm gonna have to have the
[17396.39s -> 17413.66s]  driveway come down here and then go to a single lane. But that's gonna look ugly. Hold
[17413.66s -> 17431.24s]  on. Yeah. And I'm not gonna... Just hold on. Let's do the dog park. Get rid of some of these.
[17431.88s -> 17444.26s]  Just curb it. Yeah. Doesn't have to be a garage. It could be a tool shed. But what
[17444.26s -> 17459.40s]  do you do with your car? Park on the street? Yes. But if I... No. I can make a... I can
[17459.40s -> 17465.26s]  make... I can do it. If I have a two-car garage, why would I park my car on the street?
[17466.06s -> 17477.77s]  Don't hit the tree. Don't hit the tree. Don't hit the tree. Don't hit the tree. Don't hit
[17477.77s -> 17486.79s]  the tree. Don't hit the tree. Yes. Didn't hit the tree. Don't buy them. You don't need it.
[17489.11s -> 17497.11s]  Just park in your neighbor's garage. I don't think they would be too happy about that.
[17509.86s -> 17525.77s]  A, they will. A, they will. Oh, I'm just making these patches. I got an idea for back here. A
[17525.77s -> 17533.94s]  little barbecue section. Out and around. More garden this way. Of like millions of dollars
[17533.94s -> 17538.89s]  worth of shit back here too. Because it's protected by the fence. And then a little
[17538.89s -> 17555.11s]  plague area back here. It's gonna be insane. Let's just get this over with. Let me see
[17555.11s -> 17575.93s]  what this would look like. I need like gravel. Is there like driveway? Gravel.
[17577.88s -> 17590.47s]  No, you don't like drive on crushed stone. Stone? Like this? Like pavement? Is it just
[17590.47s -> 17602.98s]  a pavement? As concrete? Yeah, but like pavement. They don't have like pavement.
[17603.78s -> 17621.67s]  It's like one of these. I don't like the designs on here though.
[17621.75s -> 17646.50s]  I just want it to be plain. That's not bad. The pebbles. It looks good. I don't hate this.
[17655.51s -> 17665.03s]  Why not search for concrete? I already did. It's like these weird... I don't like this.
[17667.88s -> 17685.30s]  I don't like the... I want like it to be just plain. There's no asphalt either.
[17690.89s -> 17699.10s]  No, this is not bad. But it's too small. That's not bad. Composite board though. No,
[17699.34s -> 17718.09s]  just break cobblestone circles. I'll just go with... I'll go with what I was doing before,
[17718.09s -> 17737.42s]  the pebble one. I like it. How big is it? 50 by... How big is that? That's so tiny.
[17737.42s -> 17745.86s]  Gold driveway. What about cat's head? Gold? This might be like kind of cool looking.
[17745.86s -> 17786.62s]  Is it spot surface? Spot surface? A sports surface. There it is. Yep, there it is.
[17787.26s -> 17796.44s]  This is fucking ugly though. I actually like that better. I like the weird like rich,
[17797.16s -> 17840.44s]  crystal one. It's called cat's. It's the biggest it can get. The first one was correct. Okay,
[17840.44s -> 17858.92s]  by many. Here we go. This is gonna take a hundred years. I have to match up the pieces.
[17885.45s -> 17904.55s]  Sand? A sand driveway. It's like the house fell over and planted its forehead into the
[17904.55s -> 17920.49s]  ground. Bark? Single color gravel. I want darker than this though. I want red. Wood cuttings.
[17922.82s -> 17936.89s]  Like black. Wood chippings? This is as dark as I can get it. There we go. This is perfect.
[17938.89s -> 17979.75s]  Perfect. Hello? Size is small enough. We want sand. We want sand. No. No, you can't always get
[17979.75s -> 18015.64s]  what you want. But what about what I want? What do I want? This is what I want. Fucking huge.
[18015.64s -> 18041.54s]  Tear down the garage. I don't think I can. It's like it's a structure that can't be moved,
[18041.54s -> 18054.33s]  I don't think. Move it closer to the road. Tear it down and make it closer.
[18061.91s -> 18070.49s]  This is as big as I can get it. All right, so I'm gonna change this in a minute here. This
[18070.49s -> 18077.10s]  is straight over here. So the car, you have to have enough for the car to turn in here.
[18077.18s -> 18112.47s]  Car comes in. Straight through. Yeah, that's fine. And then, yeah, it turns into the two car garage
[18112.47s -> 18123.69s]  right here. Because this is too close. This is right here. It's too close to the edge of the
[18123.69s -> 18163.53s]  house. Let me see what happens if I do this. Come on, get it. We're keeping our sand. Where
[18163.53s -> 18178.78s]  are you gonna get the sand? Where you get this magic sand? So then here, I'm gonna go like
[18178.78s -> 18216.28s]  this. This can be changed. It's hard to, look, there's not specific tools I can paint well with.
[18216.28s -> 18222.70s]  I can't like brush it like this. I have to put it all the way over here, see? They're not the
[18222.70s -> 18250.09s]  best tools. It's not gonna be exact. Plus we're gonna put stuff on the sides anyways. No,
[18250.09s -> 18254.89s]  look, look. All right, I'm gonna show this to you one more time. I can't start deleting.
[18254.89s -> 18261.53s]  Look, look it! I can only start deleting when it's there. And if I click right now,
[18261.53s -> 18266.06s]  you know what's gonna happen. Even when it's tiny. Look, like.
[18270.22s -> 18346.63s]  I'm just covering this up with fucking bushes. There we go. Flatliner raid coming in.
[18346.63s -> 18354.49s]  To fix this over here though. All right, let's put some grass down.
[18354.49s -> 18364.84s]  Because then there'll be like a bush here. Like a little fence or something.
[18364.84s -> 18381.78s]  All right, time for grass. Are you looking? Here it comes. This actually is gonna suck.
[18381.78s -> 18397.58s]  I should have done this first. This is gonna be horrible. I can't tell. Is that right?
[18398.38s -> 18409.27s]  Is it running the edge? Yeah, god damn it. Why can't I just paint the grass? Why,
[18409.27s -> 18415.99s]  why can't I just like have a grass tool? Why do I have to roll it out in a straight line?
[18415.99s -> 18449.94s]  That's not even. Get it. Get it. I did it. Thank god. Oh my goodness. Stop,
[18449.94s -> 18452.90s]  stop. I did it. I got it good. It's good. What are you talking about? Stop.
[18452.90s -> 18474.38s]  I got it. Crisis has been averted. Don't worry guys. Everything's just fine. I can't wait to do
[18474.38s -> 18479.03s]  everything and then look back at just how amazing it was. I can't wait to look back
[18479.83s -> 18486.52s]  at some of the real highlights of this stream. You know, disposing of all the stuff. Putting
[18486.52s -> 18492.65s]  up the plants. Asking for you guys what you think. Doing probably the best peter driven I
[18492.65s -> 18496.09s]  think I've ever done in my life. There's been some pretty good highlights from me here.
[18499.14s -> 18518.18s]  He's gonna get one more. One more. One more. One more. It's too addicting.
[18519.06s -> 18533.08s]  Just gonna keep rolling. Oh, Jesus. Dr. Low Note just came in with 10 community subs. Thank
[18533.08s -> 18542.46s]  you, Dr. Low Note. That's a lot of subs. Thank you for the huge amount of community subs. Dr.
[18542.46s -> 18553.27s]  Low Note. I, don't worry guys. I will, I will satiate your sand appetite because there's
[18553.35s -> 18560.79s]  gonna be a big sand play pen over here on the, to the left. You guys are making flat lines?
[18562.07s -> 18580.47s]  That's so stupid. Let's go straight up. A big litter box. Oh, it's gonna be like a little
[18580.47s -> 18600.22s]  sand castle thing. Is there any dirt back here? Did I just line that up perfectly first try?
[18600.22s -> 18608.92s]  Tell me I did. Oh, that was so close. I love how I just said first try. It's actually
[18608.92s -> 18629.19s]  like 400th try as far as I can get it to here. Let's try. I'm gonna try to get this
[18629.19s -> 18648.74s]  little edge. It's gonna be rough. See if I can do it. Dude, what's with the Z fighting going on
[18648.74s -> 18655.82s]  in the back? I know. That's what I was saying earlier. So that's Z fighting right there,
[18655.82s -> 18664.12s]  right? That's what you guys are talking about. He's wasting money. I have $374,000.
[18665.40s -> 18671.96s]  I got plenty. I'm gonna sell this house for like a million dollars. So don't worry. I'll be
[18671.96s -> 18681.22s]  fine. This is gonna be really, really horrible though. Oh, this sucks. How am I gonna take
[18681.22s -> 18700.94s]  care of this? What's the reliable way to do this? It's alright. You have 500k before the
[18701.50s -> 18723.42s]  Jenga debacle. Yeah, I'll get it all back. This house is gonna be worth a lot of money.
[18723.42s -> 18728.94s]  Get in there and clean that up. Let's go with a small one. Not just a regular one, right? So
[18728.94s -> 18737.43s]  I can just get it right on the edge here. How am I gonna do this? I'm gonna have to
[18737.43s -> 18751.58s]  start like here. I'm just gonna have to add gravel. That's two. No, I'm just gonna add gravel.
[18751.58s -> 18756.94s]  I got enough grass here. What I can just do from here and it'll be fine. And then I'll just
[18756.94s -> 18769.94s]  cover it with gravel. When am I gonna do the swamp? Swamp is gonna be on the other side.
[18769.94s -> 18791.88s]  Wait, what's swamp? What are you talking about? The swamp. What are we doing? I guess
[18791.88s -> 18802.49s]  we're doing a swamp. By swamp, they meant circus. I still have to go. Remember we tried
[18802.49s -> 18807.96s]  that yesterday? Putting the little wood chips and stuff and it doesn't work because this is
[18807.96s -> 18812.70s]  its own hitbox. It's on collision. I have to put a bush in front of it or something.
[18813.50s -> 18822.04s]  Alright, last one. This should do it. Let's get a regular one. And I can just, I actually
[18822.04s -> 18827.02s]  can use this to make its own line. I'm kind of in crooch here and it's no, I can't.
[18828.26s -> 18842.07s]  I can't. I'll just do it with the gravel. That'll be fine. I'll clean it up. Don't worry.
[18849.14s -> 18854.50s]  Oof, perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. So I'll get the square and I will just square it
[18854.50s -> 18863.42s]  up and then move down and square it up and then move down. Looks pretty good. Which,
[18863.42s -> 18876.66s]  what color was this? This is the dark one, right? Crushed stone. Is it gravel?
[18879.91s -> 18884.55s]  Two. This one, tiny little pebble. That doesn't look, that's a false advertising.
[18885.11s -> 18898.47s]  I need to square as well. Hey chat, is this your precious sand?
[18899.43s -> 18904.14s]  What a shame it is if somebody would have covered this all up.
[18931.18s -> 18938.73s]  Not very much left, unfortunately.
[18961.77s -> 18989.22s]  This music is really not making this as sad as I want it to be.
[19007.54s -> 19011.46s]  He's just playing with us now. He's toying with us now. He's toying with us.
[19011.46s -> 19039.29s]  This is already a sharp edge. What are you doing? Okay.
[19039.29s -> 19061.13s]  There's going to be a bush anyways, so it's okay. Is this the sand here? I can't have that.
[19061.85s -> 19069.74s]  All right, there's going to be some bushes. Finally, we're, no we're not. God, we're not
[19069.74s -> 19083.54s]  done at all. I need more turf. A small one to get over here. Did I get it right?
[19091.43s -> 19113.10s]  No. It's okay. I can clean it up. It's fine. Give me the, give me a bigger one.
[19113.74s -> 19122.52s]  It's the regular one and we'll be good here. Right there. Plus I will have something on the,
[19123.24s -> 19127.22s]  maybe a couple, maybe those kind of tall hedges. What do you guys think?
[19127.94s -> 19164.54s]  You guys picked this time, not me. Sand around the edges? That could work. It's not ruined yet.
[19164.54s -> 19182.78s]  Not yet, not yet. Because I'm gonna, just like I did over here, we're gonna fix this.
[19182.78s -> 19195.05s]  It's not ruined. I want to know, like, when you do the smile like this,
[19195.05s -> 19212.90s]  are you doing that in real life too? I bet you aren't. I bet you're not. I bet you're just
[19212.90s -> 19246.28s]  sitting there tightening it. You don't actually mean it. I'm just going to put some, there'll
[19246.28s -> 19250.62s]  be bushes here. I'm not going to spend like an eternity trying to get this perfect. We're
[19250.62s -> 19261.29s]  going to have bushes, hedges. There's no reason to do this. Not at all. All right.
[19262.47s -> 19269.37s]  Hey, you guys still awake? You guys still with me here? We have what is the beginning
[19269.37s -> 19297.86s]  of a driveway? A tree? I need, I kind of like these things. Those tall, every maybe like
[19297.86s -> 19303.94s]  right next to each other. I could go all out and just line it with these or with these.
[19304.58s -> 19310.87s]  What do you guys think? Don't worry, the carrots will go to the circus. Don't worry.
[19310.87s -> 19315.19s]  I know everyone's going to freak out when they see that. I'm thinking a line of these
[19318.12s -> 19333.30s]  right next to each other or these ones. These ones here make them flaming hot
[19333.30s -> 19340.94s]  Cheeto flavored. What do you think? Or I don't think it should be green.
[19346.65s -> 19360.57s]  Regular Cheetos or flaming hot Cheetos? You need to combine these to heal. God. Flaming hot
[19360.57s -> 19375.88s]  Cheetos? Let's see. Let's take a look and I'm talking back to back here all the way down.
[19375.88s -> 19382.17s]  Now that'd be like kind of like monarch, right? That'd be royalty. Too royalty. Too much royalty.
[19384.07s -> 19403.59s]  Uh no, I don't like it. I don't like that either. It's gonna be bigger. Maybe these?
[19406.95s -> 19414.62s]  Oh Jesus, these are fucking huge. Okay, does anybody feel like these are too big?
[19414.62s -> 19433.58s]  Is it that I got like a weird scale here? They're that big? These? I don't know. I don't
[19433.58s -> 19441.86s]  mind this. Although it's kind of big and annoying. This might be too annoying. Maybe.
[19442.82s -> 19451.93s]  I'm afraid there are no cactuses unfortunately in one of these. Let's see. That's a little less
[19451.93s -> 19459.35s]  insane. Let's, I got money so let's just play with it. Ready? I need to be close enough to
[19459.35s -> 19489.22s]  be on them. What's that one? It's not a Christmas tree runway. It's, there's gonna
[19489.22s -> 19535.67s]  be other stuff in between. Two more. Where's the reindeer? Stop. Shut up. Stop it. Hey,
[19535.67s -> 19555.66s]  leave me alone. Oh man. Oh man. Let's look. See it's, it doesn't look, it looks fine.
[19555.66s -> 19566.92s]  That looks okay. That looks fine. There's nothing wrong with that. I'm gonna put some
[19566.92s -> 19587.82s]  flowers in the middle. I'll put a row of like red flowers down here. Or orange. I'm doing it.
[19587.82s -> 19610.34s]  You know, I don't care what the haters say. Oh, the haters are right this time.
[19619.80s -> 19624.94s]  The five people who are on the left have all fallen asleep. They haven't commented
[19624.94s -> 19640.42s]  over an hour. Is that true? Just stick with me guys. Stick with me. I've got a, I got a plan.
[19641.88s -> 19646.04s]  Just the back, this is just the, we're gonna finish up the back here. I don't need anything
[19646.04s -> 19657.46s]  on this side. In fact, I am gonna put this one here. No I'm not. Put it back. I haven't even
[19657.46s -> 19674.28s]  planted this. Where was it? It was like right there. That's okay. That's good. I haven't even
[19674.28s -> 19713.27s]  planted this. That looks good. What, what's wrong with having all these trees? You're losing
[19713.27s -> 19727.99s]  the casual audience. Should I spray myself with a hose? I actually kind of like this.
[19728.71s -> 19733.27s]  You can call me a boomer if you want. It looks fine. It looks good. I think it looks all right.
[19737.96s -> 19742.92s]  I really do. And we're gonna do a huge, a couple of huge ones over here.
[19743.48s -> 19746.36s]  No we're not. No, we don't need anything over there. No, no. Watch this.
[19747.00s -> 19780.82s]  Ladies and gentlemen, these look like they're too tall. They're too tall.
[19781.38s -> 19790.78s]  They gotta be shorter. Just by like, not by very much. Here we go. There we go. There it is.
[19791.50s -> 19864.14s]  Okay, if they were symmetrical. It's not a clown garden. It's not a clown.
[19868.71s -> 19896.89s]  This is not a clown garden. This is a normal garden with fun things. Still a clown.
[19896.89s -> 19904.33s]  And then back here is gonna be a couple of other things. It's not a clown garden. Hey,
[19904.33s -> 19917.19s]  that's a pretty nice clown garden. Back to orange. I just got here. Why is he making a
[19917.19s -> 19964.58s]  clown garden? I think it looks pretty. And then we're gonna do yellow. It's five, five,
[19964.58s -> 19991.75s]  and then bingo. This one had to be six because it was a little longer. That looks kind of nice.
[19991.75s -> 20030.82s]  And then I'm gonna get, watch this, a cinnamon apple tree. Apple trees down here. Get them
[20030.82s -> 20055.53s]  in the middle. Those are clown noses. Oh, fuck. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm flatlining. Please
[20055.53s -> 20062.70s]  switch to the pre-recorded track. I told you it was gonna be all night. I gave you fair warning.
[20062.70s -> 20068.46s]  I warned you like four hours ago that we were gonna go all night and I was gonna make an entire
[20068.46s -> 20081.10s]  fucking done house. It's gonna be unbelievable. Your jaw's gonna hit the ground. Dude, I got
[20081.10s -> 20085.90s]  beers to go. There you go. What time is it? It's like nine o'clock Pacific. Oh, it is
[20085.90s -> 20090.86s]  midnight. Whatever. All night. What is it? Friday? What are you doing tomorrow? It's
[20090.86s -> 20113.64s]  Friday night. What do you got going on tomorrow? It's a weekend. I think that looks cool. Yes,
[20113.64s -> 20120.94s]  sure. You could tell me that this looks like Baby's First Unity game. I, okay, I would,
[20120.94s -> 20131.98s]  I might laugh at that. I would chuckle at that for a second. Did you see what it looked
[20131.98s -> 20145.72s]  like before? Okay, and now, what am I gonna put the red frid, wait, what's the deal with
[20145.72s -> 20154.26s]  the red fridge? I need something on the other side. What should go on the other side here
[20154.26s -> 20167.18s]  on the right? Maybe like a hand rail, a railing. Is it gonna hand rail? Something, this is missing
[20167.18s -> 20178.10s]  something. A flower bed. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. A red fridge. I'm not putting a
[20178.10s -> 20222.15s]  red fridge. Why would anybody have this many plants? All right, let's be honest. Why would
[20222.15s -> 20228.70s]  somebody have this much, this many plants? Dude, this is a full-time job for like 10 people
[20228.70s -> 20236.10s]  to maintain all this. To take care of all this stuff, you would need fucking like 12 employees.
[20236.66s -> 20250.36s]  All right, so let's put some flowers in here. Flowers. Nice ones. Strawberry flower. Large roses.
[20251.16s -> 20350.57s]  Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. There we go. This is so much time and energy.
[20351.37s -> 20358.60s]  How would you even know one of these died? Would you even know? I feel like you wouldn't
[20358.60s -> 20369.98s]  know when one of these died. I already blew it though. Does it move the whole thing?
[20370.70s -> 20402.39s]  Thank god it does. I need more gravel here. Look at that. Better. Looks better. I need one more here
[20402.39s -> 20424.65s]  I think. Move this one back. Move this one forward. Gravel. This trash in the garage,
[20424.65s -> 20454.90s]  doesn't it? Some gravel. Go right to the edge on this one. I wonder if I should just
[20454.90s -> 20463.32s]  put that around here? Yeah. Hello, can I get an estimate of getting my lawn done? I'm sorry,
[20463.32s -> 20477.90s]  I add in the paper. Uh, $500,000 in one payment. Something's missing here though.
[20478.38s -> 20494.28s]  I got my trees. I got the, maybe something else right there. A big boulder or a fountain.
[20494.28s -> 20502.73s]  A fountain. I like a fountain better than a boulder. Which one? This one looks kind of good.
[20503.37s -> 20519.45s]  Try the blue. What if we did two fountains? Fountain, fountain, and fountain in the middle.
[20520.09s -> 20558.23s]  Wait a minute. Hold on. No. No. No, don't work. This might go over here. I'm gonna
[20558.23s -> 20581.22s]  sneeze. I'm just boring you. Maybe just one of the big ones. Like one of these. Stone.
[20581.22s -> 20601.59s]  Green. That. Let's see this. That's not terrible. Turn it though. I think it's the same color as
[20601.59s -> 20612.33s]  the grass. I don't think I can even do that. You guys want me to change off of Sandy? Is that
[20612.33s -> 20623.59s]  what you guys are saying? All right. Something right here. I think in, I'm thinking something
[20623.59s -> 20633.13s]  cool. A little decoration. Maybe you have a big, big tulip, blamp, birdbath, rabbit cage.
[20633.77s -> 20673.88s]  A big rock. Another pool? Yeah. Move it over a little bit. You're gonna have so many
[20673.88s -> 20733.53s]  mosquitoes. So extra. I figured out what I'm doing. I am desperately trying to have the
[20733.53s -> 20741.13s]  coolest house on the block for their Christmas decorations. I'm trying to make one of those
[20741.13s -> 20746.76s]  houses that you drive by during Christmas. And you go, holy fuck, that person's insane.
[20757.16s -> 20763.78s]  I have to have the most ridiculous house on the whole lot. Except all year round. Yeah,
[20763.78s -> 20768.97s]  that's it. This is too, okay, I'm getting way too super extra extra. Let's do something
[20768.97s -> 20774.65s]  over here too. This house is gonna be worth a fucking trillion dollars. Bird feeder. Perfect.
[20775.74s -> 20787.42s]  Make it not ash. Right near the tree. Right here. Right here. No, no, no, no, that goes
[20787.42s -> 20797.98s]  over here. That goes in the backyard. So you can look out the window from your fucking weird
[20797.98s -> 20837.08s]  dungeon room and see the birds eating. All right. And then a gazebo. Never mind. Won't
[20837.08s -> 20879.90s]  fit. Can I have a bridge go over the driveway? How do I? Oh, there's too much here. Garden. Um,
[20880.70s -> 20888.09s]  fences. No, uh, architecture. No recreation. Um, yeah, something fun. No, that goes in the
[20888.09s -> 20916.94s]  back. A hammock. Right here. Right in between the apples. You come out here and enjoy the
[20916.94s -> 20927.10s]  pond. Grab an apple. You can just like bite into it. I'm going to turn this actually.
[20927.10s -> 20949.42s]  Just a little bit. Pull it forward. This is fucking insane. Nice. Ruined. Change it back.
[20949.42s -> 20960.68s]  All right. This is coming together. This looks really interesting. By the way, interesting is
[20960.68s -> 20966.62s]  a fake compliment when something looks terrible, but you don't say it looks bad. It looks
[20966.62s -> 20978.26s]  interesting. Which means bad. All right. I think we're done with the driveway portion. Well,
[20978.26s -> 20982.30s]  it gets over here later when we leave the backyard. I want something secret back here
[20982.30s -> 20990.55s]  that the only I know about nobody else does. Yeah. I want a secret grill back here. No,
[20990.55s -> 20996.02s]  I want a tire swing back here. I want a fire pit back here. No, that goes in the backyard. I want
[20996.02s -> 21031.54s]  a secret grill. That makes no sense. Remember I told you I needed something here. This is
[21031.54s -> 21061.43s]  what we needed. This is what we needed. I need to move this. How do I move this?
[21070.60s -> 21079.50s]  Too much. Is it too much? I feel like, um, I feel like this is okay though. Does this need
[21079.50s -> 21096.01s]  to go? No, I think that's fine. You're gonna go up a ski lift. But a fire pit needs to go here.
[21096.01s -> 21102.14s]  No, that needs to go in the backyard. Can I put this here? There has to be like a table. Give
[21102.14s -> 21118.23s]  me a table. Table. Something fun. Something cool. Something swanky. Something chic. Here
[21118.23s -> 21133.45s]  we go. This is turning into a grandma house. It's turning into an old lady house. Real quick.
[21138.78s -> 21146.07s]  This is really quickly. I need something over here though. It looks all right.
[21146.87s -> 21156.92s]  I like that color. Um, I want a little, I want something over here. Edible plants. Um, pumpkin?
[21156.92s -> 21167.56s]  No, that makes no sense. What can go right? Nothing. Nothing needs to be right here until we
[21167.56s -> 21180.79s]  get over here. And then we got, bang, here's your walkway. Walkway. Let me get this going
[21180.79s -> 21197.05s]  here. I need like a good pool and a pool fit back here. Why is the front yard way bigger
[21197.13s -> 21217.64s]  than the backyard? All right, here we go. I want a sick patio barbecue. Bring your friends over.
[21217.64s -> 21224.34s]  Chill. Have a couple of drinks. Talk shit about the game. Last game that came out.
[21224.34s -> 21232.23s]  All right, here we go. I'm going to go with out these doors. This is like the, this is
[21232.23s -> 21235.43s]  like a cigarette den, right? You go out here and you have like a cigarette. This is where
[21235.43s -> 21238.63s]  the people that go have cigarettes. This is not like in the, who cares? This is stupid.
[21239.19s -> 21248.04s]  Out here, though, is the whole thing. So I'm going to go with one of those.
[21249.46s -> 21272.95s]  Um, what are they called? What's the thing that, um, not a gazebo. What's it called?
[21285.06s -> 21290.10s]  Yeah, there. Okay. Yeah, there it is. Perp, gondola. Isn't it? What is a gondola?
[21298.47s -> 21306.74s]  God, the gondola is a boat. I'm going to say we want something a little lighter.
[21307.38s -> 21353.93s]  Maybe, maybe white. I like this bank. Shit. That actually is ruined. Yes. I know. I know.
[21353.93s -> 21394.02s]  I got it. I got it. I fixed it. I got it. Everything's fixed. Come on. Come on. Killing
[21394.02s -> 21430.04s]  me here. I know. No, God damn it. It's got to be closer to the house somehow.
[21430.04s -> 21440.66s]  Right there. Got it. Finally. Holy shit. That's too long. All right. Now let's go
[21440.66s -> 21446.66s]  ahead and let's make a little bit of a, I think I'm going to do a little bit of mulch.
[21446.66s -> 21456.18s]  I'm going to do some mulch that goes around here and like stops here. Let's mulch it.
[21456.18s -> 21478.65s]  I need some walkway. I need some paving stone here. That's an interesting design.
[21479.99s -> 21509.43s]  Paving stone, uh, symphonia. Which one? I like this one. Use the stepping stones.
[21510.15s -> 21527.66s]  I will. We're going to do these, uh, sandy. I need something. I need something out here first,
[21527.66s -> 21569.70s]  though. Stepping stones is later. Perfect opportunity for our cat. Is it not flush?
[21570.66s -> 21572.10s]  Can it even be flush with the house?
[21598.62s -> 21624.09s]  Saved it. It's too big. What the hell? Why? I can't do anything about that. Is this going to
[21624.09s -> 21662.50s]  have to be there? I can use the small pieces later. It's not matching up. I need the smaller
[21662.50s -> 21676.79s]  one to do the front here. What color do I want? This one, this, and then this, right? Right here?
[21678.30s -> 21699.42s]  Beige and dark gray. I thought that should do it. In fact, I'm going to make sure it does it.
[21699.42s -> 21727.34s]  I'm going to come out again. No, get rid of this door. Oh, hello? Why? Hello? What was
[21727.34s -> 21747.50s]  that happening for? Starting. I got it. Okay. Now I should be able to do the bigger piece.
[21754.34s -> 21765.37s]  Beige and dark gray. Now will this line up correctly in here? I'm going to have to just
[21765.37s -> 21775.56s]  sacrifice. Yeah, it does. We're good. That's all right. I can, I can work with this later.
[21775.56s -> 21798.14s]  Right on the edge here. Come on. Come on. Why? Give me a break. I'm going to have to do
[21798.14s -> 21816.02s]  little pieces. This thing's in the way. It took so long to get this flush too. All right,
[21816.02s -> 21821.06s]  it should work now. It should be good to go. There we go. Okay. Are we lined up? Do we
[21821.06s -> 21830.10s]  have good, uh, what's the best way? What do you think? Right there. Thank God. Finally.
[21838.54s -> 21842.74s]  I can use the little piece and I can go in the middle here. I think. I hope so.
[21880.38s -> 21891.54s]  No, it's not going to work. I could just fill this with rocks.
[21893.58s -> 21896.94s]  I'm just going to gravel this up. We're going to do two-tone. Gravel, gravel.
[21897.50s -> 21901.10s]  All the way out. Here we go. We can do it with like sand or graph. We'll do it.
[21901.10s -> 21921.02s]  We'll be fine. Now I can just build this out. It actually might look kind of good.
[21922.73s -> 21926.81s]  It's not going to look bad. That's for sure. It's going to look, you know, you know what I'm
[21926.81s -> 21941.93s]  saying. It might look pretty good. Come out. I wonder if should we do it like that and just
[21941.93s -> 21949.83s]  have the middle there have a little bit. Maybe put something in there and then go across
[21949.83s -> 21976.18s]  here. Let's see what this looks like. This is kind of fucked up looking. That's not going
[21976.18s -> 21984.41s]  to work. It's got to go closer. I'm not sure I can. Can I even go closer with this one?
[21985.21s -> 22015.94s]  I don't think I can. Oh well. I tried. I failed. This can build out here. I think I probably can
[22015.94s -> 22035.42s]  just do this now. Let me see. Is it going to work? What do you guys think? Thank God.
[22036.81s -> 22043.66s]  Thank God it worked. Now we just have to do the skinny one down here.
[22045.93s -> 22053.08s]  He genuinely loves this game. I think it's fun. I mean, all jokes aside, I think it's fun.
[22053.72s -> 22066.87s]  It's not going to take it to the edge, is it? Is there another one that's
[22066.87s -> 22076.04s]  as big as this? I don't think there is. We're just going to have to deal with it.
[22080.41s -> 22083.29s]  There's going to be like a, there'll be the big grill over here or something. You won't even
[22083.29s -> 22101.75s]  know. Yeah, you won't even know. There's like, there'll be a fucking grill right here.
[22102.95s -> 22114.28s]  We'll cap this up with some stone. Now let's see. Stone, sand, gravel. What do we got?
[22115.00s -> 22128.81s]  What do you guys think? Surface, let's see, wood cuttings? Do sand? Let's see what it looks like.
[22147.30s -> 22160.68s]  Looks a little weird, but not horrible. Let's put the gondolas back.
[22161.32s -> 22186.09s]  Gondolas go well. Yeah, they do. They actually really do. Put a nice stream of water in the
[22186.09s -> 22198.17s]  middle. Now you're talking. Now you're talking. That sounds pretty great. I must feel like,
[22201.48s -> 22219.38s]  no. It's not, it's not the same size. I can't build it out anymore. Can I?
[22220.18s -> 22229.59s]  Because essentially I would need one of these on each. Let me see. Although not yet. No,
[22229.59s -> 22232.71s]  don't freak. Don't have to freak out yet. It's possible I can get in there again.
[22241.27s -> 22253.93s]  Dark gray beige. All right. We're good. Thank God. We are good to go. It's going
[22253.93s -> 22269.24s]  to look a little sloppy, but it'll work. Somebody said the pattern's really all over
[22269.24s -> 22280.07s]  the place anyway, so it wouldn't be hard. You can't really tell anyway. The room is ruined.
[22280.07s -> 22284.95s]  What happened? What did I do? Ruin? What's wrong? What's wrong with it?
[22284.95s -> 22291.38s]  There's gonna be a grill there. You're not even gonna, you're not even gonna know.
[22291.38s -> 22306.47s]  There's actually gonna be a bunch of random things in here. So why?
[22311.62s -> 22341.42s]  Oh, now it is ruined, but I can move it up. All right, we're good. I think it's still
[22341.42s -> 22358.39s]  gonna be a little too long though. It's almost like this thing in the middle is not,
[22358.39s -> 22367.05s]  because this is longer, so it almost needs to be longer, but it can't be longer. Maybe
[22367.05s -> 22376.09s]  just bring these forward, but that wouldn't look right. It sounds like I need another
[22376.09s -> 22389.59s]  part of the wall. I can't do that because it's an external wall too. Damn it. It'll be all
[22389.59s -> 22394.02s]  right. Plus I can do a little bit like, I can do some of the crushed stone around here.
[22394.66s -> 22399.85s]  Have like a little path leading off and yeah, we'll be good. We'll be here very much.
[22399.85s -> 22414.02s]  We'll do some crushed stone. Because there's gonna be something here too.
[22414.82s -> 22420.01s]  Mm-hmm. All right, let me, let me ask you guys what's worse. Ready? What's worse?
[22420.81s -> 22449.24s]  That or this? This is better. The sand actually is causing the problem.
[22456.54s -> 22467.91s]  Yeah, it's the sand. It's the sand. Because the middle point is,
[22475.45s -> 22482.81s]  you know, I don't even, you can't even tell. That's fine. Look, take it. Ready?
[22482.81s -> 22487.37s]  If you're walking around, you talk, oh yeah, cool. There's gonna be some stuff here. There'll
[22487.37s -> 22514.15s]  be like a, you won't be able to really tell. Yeah, this is fine. Look, I'll take it. You're
[22514.15s -> 22519.10s]  gonna, I'm gonna take your eyes off it right now. You're not even gonna know that it existed.
[22519.10s -> 22560.44s]  How do you turn them on? Isn't this supposed to be water? Water wall? Lights. Here we go.
[22560.44s -> 22576.49s]  Yellow. We're gonna have like water waves. You won't even be able to know this is going
[22576.49s -> 22636.23s]  on here. Urinals. I just want to see what they did. No. All right, let's build it.
[22636.23s -> 22644.73s]  Let's build it up. Come on. Here we go. Grill. The most expensive one. A bed grill. What?
[22644.73s -> 22668.41s]  Here we go. Take a look. Grill. In the corner. Fire pit. Right here. Bingo. I want a bigger fire
[22668.41s -> 22689.00s]  pit than this. Here it is. I like it. Right there. Get that out there. This needs to be
[22689.00s -> 22698.26s]  over here though. Out further. Like back here. There we go. Nice grill. Got a couple of chairs
[22698.26s -> 22705.67s]  there. Can I turn it on? Turn it on. Talk to the grill. I actually just pressed E.
[22705.67s -> 22719.30s]  All right, now we start to go. Okay, grill. Fire pit. Give me some chairs. Give me some nice
[22719.30s -> 22769.53s]  chairs. Chair. No, we need some better chairs than this. These look all right. All right.
[22769.53s -> 22783.18s]  This chair's ugly. I'm sitting in one of those chairs. What about back it up? Other.
[22783.18s -> 22793.96s]  Ooh, what's this stuff? A sprinkler. I'm sorry, guys. There's only one,
[22793.96s -> 22817.45s]  there's only one starburst that I like. Fod. Furniture. A little table. This is nice.
[22817.45s -> 22835.10s]  This is chic. Got a blue top. Can I connect them? I might want two of these right next
[22835.10s -> 22850.73s]  to each other. All right. Do I have to kneel at this table? It's a table to kneel at.
[22850.73s -> 22855.85s]  Why is everything yellow? Everything's not yellow. Just the house, the chairs,
[22857.05s -> 22879.05s]  half of the plants. I need a little garden back here. Better table than this. This table
[22879.05s -> 22891.35s]  sucks. Just one of these. This is cute. How about one of these ones? Yeah, that's okay.
[22891.35s -> 22906.18s]  Perfect. Now you can eat your burgers over here. That table's way too big. Table alvar.
[22911.54s -> 22924.81s]  Oh, that's nice. Yeah, that's fucking sick. Definitely. Just some stools.
[22933.00s -> 22951.00s]  Take a little breakfast nook. All right. Got the grill. I need like a little table
[22951.00s -> 22968.22s]  here for the grill. Grilling table. Just like one of these. How big is this? Yeah. Boom. Right.
[22968.22s -> 22984.50s]  So you can put like the, you can put his stuff there, his utensils. This is the birdhouse.
[22984.50s -> 22992.42s]  I want to put this like over here. Right at the window. I need some bushes back here. I'm
[22992.42s -> 22999.78s]  going to need bush here, bush there on the back. Just to have a little area to play.
[23000.26s -> 23031.74s]  A red bush or a green bush? Let's go green. Get a couple of red ones in here too.
[23032.46s -> 23064.87s]  Are these ugly? I can't tell if these are ugly or not. Yeah, they are very ugly. I need just a
[23064.87s -> 23072.65s]  standard hedge. Maple trees. Oh, these are nice. I could put a few, like a handful of
[23072.65s -> 23107.42s]  these back here. They're not going to be in pots for very long. Oh, those are huge.
[23108.38s -> 23130.54s]  Those ones are already out there. Ball bush. I'll get to the pool. You want a pool? I'll make you a
[23130.54s -> 23175.75s]  pool. Just hold on a second. Oh, this looks nice. Yeah, you guys, you guys have this already.
[23175.75s -> 23186.95s]  But by the way, who, why is this house yours? This house is not your house. I don't have room
[23186.95s -> 23192.82s]  for a pool actually. Hold on. Yeah. I have enough room for like a kid's pool.
[23192.82s -> 23255.62s]  The pond is bigger than the pool. Yeah, but get this over there. This is the worst backyard
[23255.62s -> 23302.46s]  landscaping ever. I have, I'm just barely getting started. Hold on. I need more yellow.
[23303.26s -> 23322.86s]  I don't need any more yellow. What are you doing? Those flowers are going to get no sun.
[23322.86s -> 23339.70s]  That's fine. They're not real. I do want to get around. I can't, can I reach this one?
[23340.50s -> 23386.89s]  Get back there and reach it. I need to reach this flower. I need to pull it back. I'm not,
[23386.89s -> 23399.16s]  what do you mean pool? I already have a gnome. Did you not see the gnome? Can you find it?
[23399.16s -> 23417.08s]  You sure you can't find it? I need something right here. I'm going to do a line of bushes.
[23417.08s -> 23426.65s]  Small bushes. Just the same bush. A line of them right against those. 0.5 rose bush. Done.
[23426.65s -> 23438.79s]  Bingo. Now this is huge. Um, never mind. Hey, there we go. Better. There it is. Okay. Nice,
[23438.79s -> 23468.74s]  nice, nice. Check this out. Watch this. I'm going for something beautiful here.
[23530.55s -> 23569.61s]  It's terrible. What? No, I, wait, guys, I just typed into Google beautiful garden
[23569.61s -> 23592.78s]  and I'm just trying to replicate it. I'm just trying to replicate beautiful garden. All right.
[23592.78s -> 23613.54s]  I just need just regular bush pleasure. This is plagiarizing a garden. Oh man,
[23613.54s -> 23618.18s]  I can't believe you. I, you know, I thought I liked you. I can't believe you're plagiarizing
[23618.18s -> 23641.85s]  a garden. Where is it? That's close. That's close enough. I can't do another color.
[23642.41s -> 23668.94s]  There we go. Is that right? Not really. No, that looks bad. This used to be a swindle stone
[23668.94s -> 23724.07s]  stream. Yeah, you haven't been around in like four years. Lettuce? There we go. That's just,
[23724.07s -> 23745.42s]  no, this is like candy. I need like dirt or something. It's something here.
[23746.38s -> 23753.72s]  I feel like I'm getting too obsessed with the fact that it's a garden flipper and I'm just
[23753.72s -> 23761.02s]  putting tons of flowers and plants and shit everywhere. I might as well just go to the end
[23761.02s -> 23780.63s]  here. Make a swamp. I don't think I even can. These need to be closer. I have not even
[23780.63s -> 23786.82s]  remotely been inside the house. No, I still need to put grass down here. Hold on. Wait,
[23786.90s -> 23834.73s]  wait, wait, wait. Fuck the grass. Smokers get graveled. Wait, this goes here. My stomach.
[23843.27s -> 23848.90s]  Somebody said graham cracker. That's not even what it looks like.
[23856.01s -> 23858.81s]  That does not look like a graham cracker. I don't know why, but
[23859.69s -> 23865.29s]  it's funny to me for some reason. All right, let me lay grass down in the last few places and
[23865.29s -> 23876.02s]  then we can go in the house. By the way, I don't give a shit about anything inside of this house.
[23879.90s -> 23890.23s]  We're gonna, I spent so much time like out there. It's all right. I'm still going. Anymore
[23890.23s -> 23912.42s]  graham cracker? No, we can do grass here. Give me the roller. Turn the inside of the
[23912.42s -> 23917.80s]  house into a garden as well. I wish you could. You unfortunately cannot bring anything that is
[23917.80s -> 23925.85s]  an outdoor tool inside. I know. And I got that perfectly. First time ever, first try.
[23933.83s -> 23946.62s]  Almost did it again. Oops. Dog house? I know. I'll get the dog. I still have to make a circus.
[23947.93s -> 23954.66s]  I don't have enough land to make a circus. How was I ever gonna do that?
[23955.22s -> 23978.98s]  There's no way I can make a circus. You can do it in the garage. I guess, yeah, I guess
[23978.98s -> 24024.70s]  I could do the circus in the garage. A garage circus. Come on, get the last little bit of grass.
[24025.26s -> 24044.41s]  Right to the door. Come on, right in the corner. Got it. All right, nice. Gravel the house. I
[24044.41s -> 24050.68s]  can't gravel in the house. See, look. The game doesn't let you. The game doesn't want you
[24050.68s -> 24063.05s]  to be able to do that. Oh my god, what the hell. All right, I need to fix this and then
[24063.05s -> 24070.06s]  we can finish up the outside. What was it? It was the two-colored, this one, dark one,
[24070.06s -> 24083.96s]  all the way. Tiny, right. All right, here we go. Done. All right, all right, all right,
[24083.96s -> 24089.80s]  all right, all right. So we got pool, clown pit. I have to still plan all these. I didn't
[24089.80s -> 24118.65s]  even do anything over here. That's fucking hard work. We're far from done. No, I told you
[24118.65s -> 24130.74s]  I wasn't stopping. I'm not stopping till the outside is completely done and there's at least
[24130.82s -> 24159.64s]  a couch inside the house. Don't tell them. Don't tell me what. Don't tell them. I was,
[24159.64s -> 24172.33s]  what are you guys not telling me? I've been playing this for almost seven hours
[24173.05s -> 24196.15s]  and that's the first skill point. I think it's seven hours. Hey, when it gets there,
[24196.15s -> 24204.66s]  I'll have it. That looks all right. Just a little filled in back there. I can put
[24204.66s -> 24221.75s]  something else back here though. Big tree, couple little trees. Just five trees in
[24221.75s -> 24226.06s]  a square meter. I still don't understand this. All right, I'm going to have to do
[24226.06s -> 24231.51s]  something interesting here because I'm not putting any more flowers. Okay, no more flowers,
[24232.15s -> 24248.97s]  no more. I got to, what am I putting here? The dog, the dog stuff. Holy shit. Wait a minute.
[24258.86s -> 24270.50s]  How is this an outdoor cinema? It's, this is just a giant TV. Why, what does this mean
[24270.50s -> 24399.66s]  outdoor? Okay. And then you could build a real life backyard projector. What are you guys
[24399.66s -> 24425.38s]  talking about? What's wrong with the projector? Oh, you talk, you, yeah, but this has to go on
[24425.38s -> 24465.21s]  a table. I'm not just going to sit, $700. All right, hold on. No, give me, no more gravel.
[24465.21s -> 24575.85s]  You're right. What are you doing? Hey, wrong side. Just hold on. You'll see. Give me it.
[24575.85s -> 24584.97s]  Why is this crooked? What? Drive-in movie theater.
[24585.93s -> 24598.87s]  It's a motorcycle, it's a two motorcycle parking lot drive-in movie theater. It's a bicycle drive-up
[24598.87s -> 24634.70s]  movie theater. Yes, it's a bicycle movie theater. And if you want to, you can stop at our garden
[24634.70s -> 24652.58s]  on the way over here. Pull up your fucking bike. I mean, yeah, the bricks, the bricks
[24652.58s -> 24695.82s]  just go another way, but that's fine. Oh, what, what? Why is everybody freaking out?
[24695.82s -> 24708.79s]  I'm just making a little walkway, but that looks much better. What are you talking about?
[24727.91s -> 24745.98s]  What is wrong with this? I don't see the problem here. I'm going to make one more here and you
[24745.98s -> 24782.84s]  can like take a little stroll. You won't let me do gravel. I went too quick. Give me a table.
[24783.48s -> 24797.24s]  What's wrong with the simplicity of grass? Nothing really. Nothing. I see it's a thinner
[24797.24s -> 24815.77s]  table. No, this is fucking ridiculous. Come here. Simple table. There we go.
[24816.73s -> 24869.64s]  Is that level? Okay, here we go. What is a gym rope? Punching bag? The projector's facing the wrong
[24869.64s -> 24960.97s]  way. It's fine. Fresh pizza ready for you. Get this in here. Plant tomatoes. Plant tomatoes.
[24962.01s -> 24972.34s]  That's actually not a bad idea. We want food. Edible plants. What can you put on a pizza?
[24972.34s -> 24982.34s]  Nut grapes. Plums? No. Cherries? No. Apple? Apple? Blueberry? You don't put carrots on a pizza.
[24982.34s -> 25024.90s]  You don't put pumpkin. There are no pineapples, guys. I'm just kidding. Jesus. The eight cents.
[25024.90s -> 25050.06s]  It's not a big deal if I pretend to do this. All right. There you go. Okay. I need something
[25050.06s -> 25056.71s]  here. I need like a tree or something. This is empty over here. Very empty. Besides my little
[25056.71s -> 25075.80s]  dumb walkway. No, I don't think it needs anything. I'm going to put a gazebo. A gazebo will not fit
[25075.80s -> 25101.93s]  here. No, I'm not fucking doing that. Let me make a nice little thing here. Hold on. Let me
[25101.93s -> 25119.94s]  get the wrecked shrubs. The default ones. They look okay. I'm just going to let the brush
[25119.94s -> 25128.14s]  just go on the paper. I'm not going to think about it. Just let the brush flow across the
[25128.14s -> 25160.65s]  canvas. What am I thinking here? Where am I going? Okay, something else. Let's get a nice little
[25160.65s -> 25202.94s]  display here from these little ones. This is what I had before. That's the same one I had before.
[25203.66s -> 25217.38s]  I'm not thinking about it. I'm not thinking about it. Let's just go. I'm not thinking
[25217.38s -> 25251.35s]  about it at all. Okay. I don't think that's that bad. Attention streamer, you have too
[25251.35s -> 25265.51s]  many plants. Oh, I mean the name of this game is Garden Flipper. I'm going to make a huge
[25265.51s -> 25279.26s]  elaborate display. Think of a water bill. This is not called Don't Put Plants Anywhere DLC. This
[25279.26s -> 25291.22s]  is the Garden DLC. I'm going to make an elaborate fucking piece. I'm going to go back over there
[25291.22s -> 25318.94s]  and we'll do some more cleanup. Million dollar sprinkler system. This is it for plants though.
[25318.94s -> 25323.34s]  This is going to be it for plants because then I'm going to put the fucking clown stuff
[25323.34s -> 25336.39s]  in the garage and you'll be happy. Imagine if the neighbor was allergic to pollen.
[25337.27s -> 25345.26s]  He'll be okay. I need to buy one for like a couple of rock or something.
[25345.98s -> 25359.26s]  This is like a lot here. I'm going to move this. This is why you think it's too busy
[25359.26s -> 25380.74s]  because it's too far up. Better. Much better. Maybe a little bit of gravel? No. I think
[25380.74s -> 25390.31s]  that's okay. This needs something in here. Something to take it. Hold on. I need like
[25390.31s -> 25393.51s]  something in here. You're going to be mad about this but I'm just adding a couple more.
[25396.65s -> 25422.31s]  Like one, two. Rocks maybe. Some little ones. No, I think that's all right. This one's
[25422.31s -> 25436.47s]  going to go. That one's fucking the whole thing up and that one and this one and that one
[25436.47s -> 25447.53s]  and that one. What about over here? Something's going to go over here.
[25461.96s -> 25465.48s]  I've never had a house like this. I've never had a garden. I'm just trying to make a
[25465.48s -> 25472.41s]  cool garden. I've never had one before. I've never had a cool garden. Water walls.
[25472.41s -> 25479.88s]  I've never had this much money to make whatever I want. You have five gardens.
[25484.36s -> 25495.72s]  Play some windmill. I've never had a garden before. That looks good. Look at that. That
[25495.72s -> 25513.24s]  kind of ties the whole thing together. Now it's finally mini golf. All right. I'm no more. I'm
[25513.24s -> 25518.28s]  done. I'm losing my fucking mind. Okay. I'm not. No more. I just need to clean this part
[25518.36s -> 25544.54s]  up. Fuck no. I need to tie this together here. I need this because I don't hate this.
[25545.34s -> 25552.74s]  What about a path? I could do a path, but that has to start from over here and yes,
[25553.30s -> 25559.66s]  it will. That's not the right one, mom. Did I say ma? Like calling you guys mom?
[25560.38s -> 25567.82s]  That's not edit. Edit the right one, ma. It's this one, right? Okay. Here it is.
[25567.82s -> 25588.17s]  Let me see what this looks like. Is that right? Is this one?
[25589.13s -> 25641.58s]  Okay. Not bad. Not bad. I gotta, I gotta clean this back up though.
[25641.58s -> 25723.83s]  Because this is now, now this is no longer. Don't need this. Couple more stones. Yes. Give
[25723.83s -> 25731.21s]  us a tour. Not yet. Not done. I'm not done. Not done. Not done. Something's got to be here.
[25731.21s -> 25739.78s]  Something's got to go right here. I'm sorry. It does. That's just the way it is. That space
[25739.78s -> 25749.54s]  is freaking me out. I need something. I need to hide it. Uh, how about it's like a light
[25749.54s -> 25768.39s]  or something. No, no, that's fine. Negative space. You're right. What about one of these
[25768.47s -> 25781.00s]  stones to go away? Much better. 10 times better. See, I am removing things. You guys thought
[25781.00s -> 25817.62s]  I was just throwing shit. I'm removing things. Don't turn it around. I think this is good.
[25817.62s -> 25869.00s]  Put that rock back. No, I can't. Uh, what about here? This feels pretty empty. I don't like any
[25869.00s -> 25874.73s]  of this. I don't like this. I want to redo this whole thing. I don't, this is, I don't
[25874.73s -> 25892.15s]  like this. This is too much open space. There needs to be more of this. I need like a,
[25892.15s -> 25906.36s]  no, that's okay. That's fine. That looks all right. That's better. That's better. I feel much
[25906.36s -> 25949.34s]  better now. A nice lamp. Let's get a big lamp. How big are these? There we go. That's a, uh,
[25949.34s -> 25975.96s]  that is a street lamp. So yeah, nevermind. Is this knuckles? No, I can't put it inside.
[25975.96s -> 25978.76s]  Ball pits are the only thing that can go in here apparently for some reason.
[25978.76s -> 25989.18s]  Can a carousel go in here? Okay, you can. Carousel, the little kid's house,
[25989.18s -> 26010.76s]  little fun playhouse. All right, I gotta assemble it. What's going on? Can't do,
[26010.84s -> 26057.56s]  I can't do that now. What can you not do? This is the garage. I can't put the circus in here.
[26057.56s -> 26065.91s]  No pictures. I want a place for my documents. I think I'm, I'm ready to go inside. Would you
[26065.91s -> 26078.49s]  like a tour of the outside? Not yet. No, no. We get to do the whole thing. Let's make some
[26078.49s -> 26084.97s]  walls here. What do we got? This room sucks. Change it. Uh, this is going to be a bathroom.
[26085.90s -> 26102.63s]  No, closet. Watch this. I don't want that. I don't want, this looks ugly. Let's do some
[26102.63s -> 26118.10s]  paint. I'm thinking light biscuit on the walls. Maybe let's see what light biscuit looks like.
[26123.82s -> 26127.58s]  Yeah, it's been seven hours and 15 minutes and I finally made it inside.
[26127.58s -> 26140.66s]  That was a seven hour garden. Now it's going to be like, this could be a home office.
[26141.22s -> 26160.90s]  Yeah, this is an office. You'll get the whole, the whole tour is going to take like
[26160.90s -> 26173.80s]  25 minutes. It's going to be a long tour. Flesh walls. These are the color of the walls
[26173.80s -> 26184.68s]  in my room right now. This is what it looks like in my room now. A flesh wall. It's a
[26186.54s -> 26192.60s]  yeah, I don't know, tinted cigarette ash, whatever it is. Cigarette. Yeah, I would call this a
[26192.60s -> 26206.18s]  cigarette yellow, like cigarette tar. It works good for an office or a closet. I can reach it.
[26206.18s -> 26226.41s]  I'm fine. Did I just shrink? Did I shrink? Look at me. What? Maybe I should use a scaffolding
[26226.41s -> 26234.17s]  to get to the, that's not, I don't need to do that. Why would I put a scaffolding in the
[26234.17s -> 26249.18s]  house? It is not too high. I'm not going to get shown up here. Too high, huh? All right,
[26249.18s -> 26261.93s]  this wall here, we'll get an accent color. Maybe a, what should I add? What a little accent.
[26261.93s -> 26283.45s]  What do you think? Kappa? Let's see one gray. Why do I need a scaffolding to reach this shit?
[26283.45s -> 26291.66s]  That's so stupid. I have a long pole. Did my, my character shrunk? Okay, what do we want
[26291.66s -> 26309.98s]  for an accent color in here around the windows? Gray? Silver glacier? Steel gray? Purple? Purple?
[26312.15s -> 26351.75s]  Like a lavender or quartz? Lavender. Quartz, quartz, quartz. Um, this looks like a fucking
[26351.75s -> 26385.14s]  jelly donut room. You picked it. I didn't. I mean, I'm, yeah, you guys picked it. Why is
[26385.14s -> 26390.74s]  this wall, I swear to God, this is a weird optical illusion where it looks, I feel like
[26390.74s -> 26400.79s]  I'm shrinking, but I'm tall enough over here, but I'm shrinking over here. This is freaking
[26400.79s -> 26419.27s]  me out a little bit. I'm not going to lie. See, look at, I'm not even, something really
[26419.27s -> 26430.06s]  fucked up is going on. Cause like, I'm tall enough over here? Why is this house, how tall
[26430.06s -> 26436.90s]  are these ceilings? These ceilings are like 30 feet tall. I'm standing on the paint can.
[26436.90s -> 26443.51s]  Okay. All right. Carpet color. The first color I see in chat is the one that's going
[26443.51s -> 26448.41s]  in here. Carpet color. What do you got? First color I see. Don't care what it is. Red.
[26448.41s -> 26476.58s]  Why does that have to be red? Can I even do red? Okay. There's no red. I don't, there's no red.
[26476.58s -> 26504.12s]  So we're going to have to do something else. This looks like shit. No, that looks all right.
[26504.12s -> 26519.80s]  I like that. Oh, I like that because that's, look, that's the wall. Yeah. The blue. All
[26519.80s -> 26551.78s]  right. I'll try the blue. I'll give it another chance. It's all right. What color
[26551.78s -> 26560.46s]  is this carpet? This carpet is like a white with beige, beige, white, a little bit of tan.
[26561.10s -> 26573.38s]  The walls are like a sand. This is a Pee-wee Herman room. All right. Well, this is supposed
[26573.38s -> 26582.15s]  to be, this is the office. So we need a desk. A nice one. The nicest one you can buy. This is
[26582.15s -> 26594.49s]  the desk that I currently have right now. Is there walnut? How could you not have,
[26595.05s -> 26616.42s]  it's on walnut. All right. Okay. Let's get a chair. Office chair. Looks pretty good.
[26617.06s -> 26630.70s]  I like that kind of sandstone look. Computer in here. Good computer. The computer brushy.
[26631.34s -> 26638.23s]  Computer Phoenix. Computer Sphinx. Well, that's the best one we can buy. So we're going to get
[26638.23s -> 26656.98s]  it. Let's get the monitor. So we need more. I mean, a lot of them. We need at least two.
[26657.54s -> 26671.48s]  Okay. I didn't think it was going to be that big. That is a very large monitor.
[26677.26s -> 26682.39s]  Now you're gaming. Yeah, we're dropping a bunch. How are we dropping this many frames at like
[26682.55s -> 26691.00s]  11 o'clock at night? It's like, that doesn't even make sense. We had like seven hours of like
[26691.00s -> 26699.98s]  green internet and now at like 11 PM? What the fuck? Are you serious? This is literally
[26699.98s -> 26720.02s]  my boyfriend's setup. It's an interesting setup. Press C. How long was I crouched for?
[26731.70s -> 26751.99s]  I may have been crouched the whole game. No, I didn't notice because
[26754.15s -> 26766.98s]  you look it. You walk the same speed. You just lower to the ground. That's why I couldn't reach
[26766.98s -> 26780.23s]  the shit like eight hours ago. Oh my god. I'm just gonna finish my office please. All right,
[26780.23s -> 26825.46s]  I need a mouse. And it's in gamer grub with my sardines. Why do I have it in the office
[26825.46s -> 26831.64s]  so I can snack on them? I just mute the microphone. I just start eating. Dwarf soup.
[26831.64s -> 26854.36s]  It's odd. A propane tank under your desk. All right, that's good. We need a little bit
[26854.36s -> 26865.05s]  of a, let's see, furniture. We need, I don't know, maybe like a little bookcase. Yeah,
[26865.05s -> 26876.47s]  this is nice. A little drawer in the corner. What else? What do I have? What's in my office?
[26877.27s -> 26905.75s]  A fuck you table. A closet. There's nothing else in here. There's a keyboard. There's not
[26905.75s -> 26915.78s]  really a whole lot of room for this. All right, well, new plan. You reach over and grab the
[26916.74s -> 26927.59s]  mouse. All right, like at what point, at what point do you just figure out how to
[26927.59s -> 26946.74s]  get, get a smaller monitor? Okay, you have to tilt your head to the left. You need to have
[26946.74s -> 26953.61s]  a windmill in here to power the PC with clean energy. I don't think so. I don't think I'm
[26953.61s -> 26967.61s]  going to do that. All right, we need paint. Living room. Sierra Mist. Young Fly. I like
[26967.61s -> 26995.40s]  this one. Peach. Peach might look alright. Peach or Velvety Peach? Which one? Velvety?
[26995.40s -> 27019.08s]  I'll give it a trial run for you. How about Bright Peach? Let's try that one. It's a little
[27019.08s -> 27072.78s]  lighter. It's better. We're not the same. No. You got to do clown stripes. I just need to
[27072.78s -> 27081.03s]  get a couch in here. The couch is the finishing touch. That means that, that means
[27081.03s -> 27097.26s]  the house is done and we can do our 35 minute tour. What about the ground in here? I'm
[27097.34s -> 27123.88s]  thinking basil. Hey Lois, I'm a clown now. There are no lights. I'll put some lamps in
[27123.88s -> 27132.57s]  here and stuff. No, we're not doing another ice cream shop. This is just going to be
[27132.57s -> 27150.73s]  a regular house. House was so fucked up. It was a mall at the bottom floor, an ice
[27150.73s -> 27158.14s]  cream shop at the top. You guys thought I was on like drugs this stream. What the
[27158.14s -> 27175.35s]  hell was wrong with me on that one? Yeah, this is like standard apartment building.
[27175.35s -> 27199.27s]  It doesn't matter. No, I'm not doing the family guy house. Where did you get
[27199.27s -> 27204.60s]  that information from? Is he really doing the family guy house? Where'd you get that
[27204.60s -> 27227.82s]  info? I didn't say that. That's not info from me. Am I still doing this? Yeah,
[27227.82s -> 27232.68s]  this is, this is, this is going to be a long one. This will be at least, this is
[27232.68s -> 27237.77s]  going to be like at least a nine hour stream at least. Hey, I've got the internet.
[27237.77s -> 27262.38s]  I'm going to use it. Skill point. Max upgraded painting. That's quick. Have a
[27262.38s -> 27267.70s]  few stripes to break it up. Yeah, but once I get it all painted, we'll do a
[27267.78s -> 27276.86s]  little bit of a detail work. I'm not kidding. It does look like the family guy
[27276.86s -> 27292.01s]  house even from the inside. Oh my God. Oh my God. It is the family guy house.
[27292.01s -> 27303.27s]  Here's the door that like and then this couch and the TV and the stairs
[27303.27s -> 27320.09s]  and then the kitchen. It's the family guy. Somebody look right now. I don't
[27320.09s -> 27323.61s]  know how you can do this. Is there a door right here next, right here to
[27323.69s -> 27339.51s]  the front door? This is not, no. So it's not the family guy house. See all these
[27339.51s -> 27348.04s]  similarities. You just, you're making them up in your head. Holy crap, Lois.
[27348.04s -> 27369.02s]  It's the famous streamer, German nine eight five. Oh God. Where's Chris's
[27369.02s -> 27372.78s]  room? No, I'm not doing that. I don't care.
[27383.24s -> 27387.64s]  I'm an orange hell right now, but you have to wait. I have to break it
[27387.64s -> 27391.72s]  up and do accent work. Yes, you're currently in orange hell, but this is
[27391.72s -> 27397.82s]  what painters do. They get ready and then they finish with other colors.
[27401.32s -> 27403.88s]  It's not. It's not. All right. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[27403.88s -> 27414.02s]  wait. I'm thinking like a darker purple or like a white. No, a white
[27414.02s -> 27445.96s]  guys. It's going to be white. This is ultra generic. Well, we have to
[27445.96s -> 27449.80s]  mute it a little bit because look at the fucking clown circus that's outside.
[27451.38s -> 27458.62s]  We have to have the normal house on the inside and this is too boring for
[27458.62s -> 27475.59s]  you. Is it too boring? I'm not going to do rainbow walls. You guys are
[27475.59s -> 27487.96s]  fucking crazy. What a shitty house that would be. I would throw up in every
[27487.96s -> 27490.68s]  room. If every room was a rainbow, it would just be like, you wouldn't be
[27490.68s -> 27496.90s]  able to look at it. He's doubling down on being boring now because the
[27496.90s -> 27520.65s]  outside was so fucked up. I'm, I'm sorry. Here you go. You want your
[27520.65s -> 27525.62s]  fucking, you want your donut house here. Each room is themed around a
[27525.62s -> 27564.92s]  different fucking filling. Yeah, this is strawberry. Now you're pandering.
[27564.92s -> 27569.40s]  Actually, I kind of like this. I really actually like what I just did
[27569.40s -> 27585.43s]  over here. I do. I do. I actually don't mind that at all. All right,
[27585.43s -> 27589.91s]  so let's take a look. Although I could have it without. I could do
[27589.91s -> 27594.97s]  without on this wall. Yeah, no. In fact, we're going to go from there.
[27594.97s -> 27603.96s]  We're going to go to sunny orange. It is a circus tent. Oh fuck, whatever.
[27606.49s -> 27623.43s]  It's not a circus tent. It's not a circus tent. A circus tent doesn't
[27623.43s -> 27630.41s]  look like this. It's a house. A house standing on four legs,
[27632.02s -> 27646.30s]  breathing pure oxygen. That's too much. Uh, it's got to be a morning
[27646.30s -> 27650.39s]  yellow. Let me see what the, let me see what the red actually looks
[27650.39s -> 27689.16s]  like over here. It might not look terrible. Try blue. What kind of blue?
[27689.16s -> 27714.89s]  Like a light blue, dark blue, like a royal blue. That looks good.
[27724.71s -> 27734.04s]  Family guy blue. No, family guy blue is a little darker than this.
[27739.53s -> 27742.41s]  You guys are fucking hilarious. I swear to God.
[27743.69s -> 27751.29s]  Stewie's room. How do you even remember that? How do I don't even
[27751.29s -> 27760.47s]  know what that, how do you even remember this? That seems almost
[27760.47s -> 27772.28s]  impossible to remember. Why is no door leading to the yard? Because
[27773.43s -> 27777.99s]  as of right now, I had to put down these and they've been getting in the way.
[27777.99s -> 27784.70s]  So I had to pull them up. We watch family guys so we can make the
[27784.70s -> 27791.64s]  references on your stream. Well, nice job. You got it. Those are pretty good references.
[27802.74s -> 27811.61s]  This needs to be redone. Is this the right color? No. Residrator. Right there.
[27812.57s -> 27825.62s]  I mean, yellow and, I mean, blue and brown go together very well. They just do.
[27826.74s -> 27837.24s]  Tons of schemes are with blue and brown. Let's get some appliances in here.
[27837.24s -> 27845.11s]  No, we can look at a tile of ground. Floor, floor tile for the kitchen.
[27853.43s -> 27857.27s]  Uh, we could do checkerboard. We could do, is there a beige?
[27858.30s -> 27891.58s]  This one? Sepia? That's giving me a headache. How about this one? Not bad. Could be worse.
[27891.58s -> 27916.06s]  Something's going on over there. It's a bathroom. I'm not going to have a brick
[27916.06s -> 27927.24s]  bathroom. No, this is Rocco's Modern Life. It's really easy for a house to turn into
[27927.24s -> 27940.97s]  Rocco's Modern Life in this game. Uh, let's just go with this one. Just wood. Wood floors.
[27941.61s -> 27969.24s]  Looks good. Except for over here. Now the paint doesn't match.
[27969.80s -> 27976.42s]  Well, I'm going to do, uh, let's see. What am I going to do? A carpet in here?
[27976.42s -> 27981.70s]  I'm thinking a, one of these. Let's see how this looks.
[27983.50s -> 28005.98s]  What is this doing? This is the carpet in this room right now.
[28005.98s -> 28017.22s]  No, let's go with, um, rug gray. Rug pattern. Rug gray. Let's try the gray.
[28017.22s -> 28038.44s]  What? Oh, these are just rugs. Floor panels and coverings. I mean, pine.
[28038.44s -> 28052.06s]  I just do wood through the whole house. What's, what's, what's, what's with millennials
[28052.70s -> 28067.26s]  and wooden floors? What's going on there? That's a millennial thing. I want the, the high,
[28067.90s -> 28074.01s]  the, not the low cut. I want like the really fabric-y carpet around my whole house.
[28074.01s -> 28093.88s]  The long haired carpet. Carpet is disgusting, revolting. Yeah. But when you walk around on wood,
[28095.00s -> 28101.21s]  everybody in the whole house can hear you. It's, it's boom, boom, boom, boom. You're like an
[28101.21s -> 28132.33s]  elephant up there. Carpets. It's like, it's funny. I'm, I'm being like a fake internet troll
[28132.33s -> 28140.12s]  right now because I love wooden floors. I'm just being one of those just like fucking
[28140.12s -> 28143.08s]  accounts that just goes on and just says whatever the, it's just anything that they
[28143.08s -> 28147.16s]  do. Anything to like get sort of be like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[28147.72s -> 28153.86s]  I'm just like a LARP. Yeah. I'm LARPing right now. Dark wooden floors are my
[28153.86s -> 28174.73s]  favorite thing in the world. They really are. You guys are making me like laugh too.
[28176.01s -> 28181.30s]  What's with like the comedy troupe here? You guys have been like on point today with like
[28181.30s -> 28195.29s]  the comedy. All right, let's go. Please put more in the computer room. I will. Don't worry.
[28195.29s -> 28202.30s]  I will. I will. Let me just get this down. Got doors here. This is closed.
[28202.86s -> 28232.30s]  I gotta put the other doors on here. I'm going to do dark. Nevermind. Can this not fit?
[28236.22s -> 28248.54s]  Why can this not fit? It's because of this shit right here. The lip. It's all right. I got it.
[28248.54s -> 28263.59s]  I got it in. Hungry. What do I eat? I'm hungry. I'm forcing myself to stay awake to
[28263.59s -> 28269.67s]  watch you. Don't fuck it up. I won't. Do you see the garden that I made?
[28270.47s -> 28282.94s]  You're in good hands here. All right. Computer room. Bathroom. Eat the sandwich that's been
[28282.94s -> 28290.62s]  in the car for eight months. I don't even have that car. I don't have that sandwich.
[28291.80s -> 28316.39s]  I'm not at that house. So many windows here. What is seriously with the windows?
[28317.11s -> 28337.02s]  Is the window? They're everywhere. This house is so bizarre. Tile. Wall tile. Hmm.
[28339.19s -> 28351.53s]  I'm interested in what this does. Let's see. All right. Yeah. I didn't even give you a warning
[28351.53s -> 28355.78s]  on that one. I'm sorry. I didn't have a warning. Why am I sneezing so much today?
[28358.55s -> 28377.02s]  I don't sneeze this much ever. The carpet. No. It's not the carpet. What do I feel like
[28377.02s -> 28383.98s]  eating? Dude, am I going to get a pizza? I'm going to give you guys a little bit of an
[28383.98s -> 28390.71s]  insight here. I know that people think I eat pizza every day because I always say,
[28390.71s -> 28394.47s]  you know what? I'm thinking about a pepperoni pizza. I don't, I don't do it. I don't get it.
[28399.99s -> 28406.50s]  Like three out of six streams. I say I'm going to get a pepperoni pizza delivered to the house.
[28407.54s -> 28427.58s]  You guys must think I'm like a sicko. I actually, I like this. This looks nice.
[28427.58s -> 28439.08s]  Just need a bathtub. Thinking about eating pizza is not weird. No, but saying I'm going to
[28439.08s -> 28445.78s]  eat pizza every day is a little weird. And then I go downstairs and I have like spinach
[28445.78s -> 28455.05s]  and pasta. I was thinking about getting a pepperoni pizza today. I am hungry though.
[28456.74s -> 28471.16s]  Am I going eight hours here? A quick question. I've only left this room one time in eight hours.
[28471.72s -> 28486.26s]  Is that true? Yeah, that did happen. Okay. All right. Yeah. I went to go get a glass of wine
[28486.26s -> 28494.42s]  like seven hours ago. Let me go pee and like get some water and maybe grab a snack.
[28497.94s -> 28508.36s]  I'll be right back. Didn't even pee. Yeah. No, I'll be right back. We'll finish up here.
[28510.22s -> 28675.16s]  See you very, very soon. Literally walked downstairs and Kim made pasta. He was already
[28675.16s -> 28684.18s]  ready. Beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. So I'm going to be a piece of crap
[28684.18s -> 28696.58s]  and I'm going to mute and paint walls. She's wonderful. Yes, she is. Oh, let's try this.
[28697.14s -> 28704.04s]  Paint the walls with pasta. Don't mute. No, I'm going to mute.
[28705.91s -> 28710.47s]  But 20% of the people that think this is funny, 80% of the people think this is
[28710.47s -> 28754.55s]  the worst thing they've ever heard in their life. It feels weird to sit here. I can't do it.
[28754.55s -> 28764.33s]  I'm so used to just talking. They're just staring at this. Hey, what's up? You guys
[28764.33s -> 28788.63s]  just hanging out too? I'm doing the equivalent of keyboard turning in World of Warcraft.
[28788.63s -> 28825.54s]  I'm playing with one hand. How's the pasta? I haven't even tried it. Let me try it.
[28825.54s -> 28859.45s]  Let's get a piece on here. Oh! What? Oh! It's the noise of all those bones breaking.
[28861.80s -> 28875.90s]  I can't even say this because that wouldn't even do it.
[28878.34s -> 28903.77s]  Cad said toenail in the pasta. Why would it make that loud of a noise? No, that was,
[28904.49s -> 28911.56s]  that was somebody dumped sand into your pasta. A lot of it. A point where you can visibly
[28911.56s -> 28954.90s]  see it on the plate. Let's go back to it. Sand pasta. That's disgusting. Just disgusting.
[28955.54s -> 28967.59s]  What was I doing with this? Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[28967.59s -> 28977.99s]  Then what should I do for the ground? What do I think? By the way, upstairs is going to be
[28977.99s -> 28983.53s]  just a giant bedroom. There's going to be a bed at the end of the hall and a bunch of
[28983.53s -> 28997.42s]  potted plants. Nice. I always hate when people have windows into the bathrooms. Especially,
[28998.22s -> 29001.42s]  maybe some of you guys have a house like this. If you go to somebody's house,
[29001.42s -> 29010.71s]  just making sure it wasn't crushed, who has a window in the bathroom at penile level where
[29010.71s -> 29018.15s]  you're peeing and there's a window that is at, it's like, it's at like balls level.
[29019.86s -> 29023.78s]  If that thing is not closed, if there's no curtain or even curtains, I feel like
[29023.78s -> 29032.52s]  somebody could see right through it. That's way more common than you think it is. I have
[29032.52s -> 29040.65s]  this weird fucked up fear of peeing in somebody's house that has a penile window.
[29040.65s -> 29048.70s]  And for some reason, I just think like the curtain or the blinds, somebody, you know how,
[29048.70s -> 29052.62s]  you don't have to go far enough away from blinds. You can kind of see a little bit.
[29052.62s -> 29056.34s]  I just have to feel like somebody is going to see right through one of the little cracks
[29056.34s -> 29065.51s]  of a Venetian blind and just see my penis. They don't even need to see me. They might
[29065.51s -> 29069.99s]  not even know who's in the bathroom. And like, I get out of the bathroom and it could have been
[29069.99s -> 29082.76s]  anybody. But that's, I don't like that. I don't like that. That's just, I don't want that.
[29094.58s -> 29108.10s]  He likes that. I don't like that. I don't like that. But it is, it is a little bizarre
[29111.77s -> 29126.28s]  when you go to a bathroom that is like that. Okay, almost done with the bathroom.
[29140.60s -> 29148.54s]  What are these doing need? Do they only, no, I'm just saying like through one of the
[29148.54s -> 29153.78s]  little blinds, they just, you know what I mean. This is a PG-13 stream. We don't have
[29153.78s -> 29175.34s]  to get into our related details. Yes, we do. No, we don't. PG-13 is not family friendly.
[29175.34s -> 29184.62s]  They say the F word. They say the S word. They say mean things. It's the same. Yeah.
[29184.62s -> 29191.64s]  You can say fuck at least once in a, yeah, you can say fuck one time in a PG-13 movie.
[29191.64s -> 29217.83s]  That's new. He did it twice. Oh no. All right. Remind me to not tile a wall ever again.
[29217.83s -> 29239.16s]  This takes as long as it takes to eat a bowl of pasta. It's a long time. A very long
[29239.16s -> 29256.94s]  time. Done. All right. So let's take another bite. I'm going to make the bathtub shower
[29256.94s -> 29295.16s]  and sink in the bathroom. Hmm. This is like a weird digital pixel room. I don't like it,
[29295.16s -> 29306.12s]  but whatever Stan. Actually trash. All right. Let's do a shower. Shower plumbing system.
[29306.76s -> 29321.50s]  What is this? Oh, we have to, oh, do you remember when I was talking about this game
[29323.69s -> 29327.21s]  and how I said that I really wish that it was, everything was pre-installed, everything.
[29327.85s -> 29336.33s]  This is like a year ago when we played this last. You couldn't do that before. Now you can.
[29336.89s -> 29342.54s]  So that's good. You can actually place the shower where you want to, not where they
[29342.54s -> 29379.78s]  deem it necessary. That's cool. It's a good change. A lot of sauce on this one. No, I'm
[29379.78s -> 29393.56s]  talking about on my pasta. That was a saucy one. I don't have a right flush against the
[29393.56s -> 29406.65s]  wall. Yeah, it's all right though. It's okay. In case like water gets back there and mold gets
[29406.65s -> 29423.90s]  back there, you can throw a towel back and drag it. Get a little mold. Beautiful toilet.
[29423.90s -> 29460.58s]  This game saves all the time now. Hmm. Ooh, this is nice. I need a mount. I need a mount
[29460.58s -> 29498.46s]  for the sink. Where's the mount for the sink? There it is. There. Okay. Now we can get that
[29498.46s -> 29509.08s]  cool sink. What was it down here? Yeah, this one's nice. No, no, that's not the one.
[29511.70s -> 29525.82s]  Here it is. I like this. It's got a weird bowl. I like it. Yeah, this is kind of a restaurant
[29525.82s -> 29530.73s]  bathroom. It's true. That's all right. Restaurant bathrooms are fucking awesome.
[29531.37s -> 29553.98s]  What do you mean? Incorrect? A nice restaurant's bathroom is really, really awesome
[29554.70s -> 29560.82s]  when they have these cool sinks all over the place. You don't think that
[29561.54s -> 29604.41s]  nice restaurants, bathrooms? I'm not talking about a Burger King. Toilet. A flatty or a standard.
[29604.41s -> 29621.29s]  I'll go with a flatty. Two toilets, two toilets. Yeah. You guys don't like that? I mean,
[29622.09s -> 29627.78s]  you guys use the same toilet every day? I usually use a different toilet every other day.
[29628.58s -> 29637.77s]  Keep the other one clean. I would have a toilet for every day of the week if I could.
[29644.70s -> 29648.38s]  All right, bathroom. Let's get some stuff in here. One for each cheek.
[29649.34s -> 29653.42s]  If that were the case, then you would just go right down in the middle.
[29654.54s -> 29663.34s]  If these were right next to each other, you would just go straight down.
[29665.78s -> 29672.22s]  Millionaires just buy a new mansion when theirs get dirty. Yeah, you don't have to be a
[29672.22s -> 29703.11s]  millionaire. They have two toilets in the same bathroom. Why does this stink so much? It's a
[29703.11s -> 29759.26s]  sink. Well, I heard the word restaurant bathroom, and then I got thinking, this house
[29759.26s -> 29767.88s]  sucks. And there's no, there's no room for another bathroom. Upstairs, there's not gonna
[29767.88s -> 29794.66s]  be, there's a, there's a, it's bedroom, bedrooms. I have a toilet to the kitchen.
[29799.86s -> 29806.20s]  The possibilities do open themselves up though. I have a toilet as each seat at
[29806.20s -> 29823.43s]  the dining room table. I think that's a good idea. That looks good. There's no mirror.
[29831.72s -> 29850.38s]  Uh, only one person gets a mirror. Actually, you can have one too. You, uh, just get to look
[29850.38s -> 29861.35s]  out the window. Okay, so this is the bathroom. The two stalls and the shower. This person doesn't
[29861.35s -> 29872.50s]  have very much privacy on this side, but, uh, you're okay. All right, so now let's get the
[29874.52s -> 29946.20s]  dining room table set up. Too far, right here. End of the stream. Joke. This is the end.
[29946.76s -> 29960.78s]  It's the end of the stream. I should have bought a table first. Hey, Lois!
[29964.04s -> 29972.31s]  We should put toilets in the dining room. Oh, freaking genius. Oh my fucking God.
[29975.46s -> 29976.74s]  That was fucking hilarious.
[29981.69s -> 29985.19s]  This is a nine, yeah, we've been going on eight and a half hours here.
[29985.27s -> 29996.82s]  This is a long one. This is a long one. Stop going through with it. It's too late now. Look,
[29996.82s -> 30029.03s]  I can easily just point a money gun at this and turn it off. Let's go black. Now it's a
[30029.03s -> 30062.42s]  torture house. Why would it be a torture house now? Okay, these are all the couches that are
[30062.42s -> 30091.64s]  in the game. This is that. This is a big couch. I don't think it was that big. Okay,
[30091.64s -> 30112.46s]  let's get, um, it's all right. Let's get a bookcase. Uh, this one here. Just to, you
[30112.46s -> 30125.78s]  know, brighten it up a little bit. A bag and a painting. What do you think? What's a good
[30125.78s -> 30156.97s]  painting? What do you guys like? Which one? The pink trees? Yeah, I agree. Look at this
[30156.97s -> 30190.62s]  little place. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Fridge. What is this? Oh, I thought this was a walk-in fridge.
[30190.62s -> 30205.67s]  I was like, what the fuck? That would be awesome. Oh, there's the red fridge.
[30206.39s -> 30233.86s]  Somebody wanted this really bad. Now you got it. Stove. All right, you need to have.
[30233.86s -> 30250.09s]  All right. I forgot. That's an old stove. Stanley fan. Nice. Looking good. Yeah. I'm
[30250.09s -> 30263.02s]  gonna put it on the counter. I'm in a sink. Mm-hmm. LOL. That was funny. All right,
[30263.02s -> 30281.53s]  let's get a counter. What the fuck is this? What the fuck is this? Get it up there.
[30287.78s -> 30317.05s]  Yes! Wow. I need like a little ladder. And I have an outdoor deck here. All right,
[30317.05s -> 30326.06s]  let me get some of the, hold on, some furniture. Like a chair, couch. Couple of
[30326.06s -> 30337.75s]  these things. These things are interesting, I guess, right? Yeah, some of these. Get a few
[30337.75s -> 30361.11s]  of them. This is a sick like recreation pool room. Hold on. And a gymnasium. Gym shit. Cross
[30361.11s -> 30383.48s]  trainer. That's fine like that. I can't put this inside. Outdoor gym. Okay, I need a bed.
[30385.27s -> 30392.76s]  This is not like the big pool room. And I'm painting up here like lightning electric rain.
[30402.86s -> 30410.20s]  Spring grass. Can the bed go on the balcony? I don't think I can put inside things outside
[30410.20s -> 30446.12s]  and outside things inside. Got it. Stop chewing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm trying to discreetly do
[30446.12s -> 30474.26s]  it without anybody hearing me. Let's glitch to a well. Just painting over cinder blocks.
[30474.26s -> 30495.37s]  Kind of. Kind of, yes. That is true. Okay. No drywall. No, drywall. That's not really in the
[30495.37s -> 30509.88s]  game. You just pick what you want and do it. I actually like that color. This is a nice pool
[30509.88s -> 30526.55s]  color. Why does the paint make that noise? It's actually very accurate. It is shockingly
[30526.55s -> 30552.10s]  accurate to what it sounds like. Get those paint cans. We're getting close. Maybe like another 20,
[30552.10s -> 30556.60s]  30 minutes and we're going to be ready for the tour. And then I want to compare. I want
[30556.60s -> 30561.62s]  to watch a clip. I'm going to walk the same path that I walked in the clip. Do we have a
[30561.62s -> 30565.80s]  clip of when I did it? I want to watch it and then walk the same path. I want to put
[30565.80s -> 30591.86s]  it on screen and do it at the same time. Almost empty. He's going to react. Yeah,
[30591.86s -> 30614.04s]  I'm going to react to my own clip. I'm having a weird spot. I like the pool room.
[30618.17s -> 30626.18s]  It's a $12,000 pool. Seriously, if I don't get $600,000 or $700,000 with this house,
[30626.90s -> 30643.75s]  I'm going to be pretty upset. Let's do that thing again. Uh-oh. I think we're doing too
[30643.75s -> 30656.15s]  many assets in the game. It's starting to freak out. I have like 150 assets outside.
[30656.15s -> 30683.70s]  I might be slowing the engine down. I just saw the family guy clip from earlier and
[30683.70s -> 30688.90s]  wow. What do you mean? Why are you seeing that? Who is linking that to you?
[30689.70s -> 30701.10s]  You guys are already sharing that?
[30719.37s -> 30751.40s]  That's a lot. People will be mad if I miss these. It's happened before. All right,
[30751.40s -> 30755.22s]  one more wall and that's it. And then I got to put a bed downstairs.
[30755.30s -> 30781.83s]  Be mad. Why are you? Why? My clip has 66 views. Yeah, but I was doing like a dumb ironic stupid
[30781.83s -> 30787.91s]  like look at my Peter Griffin. I know how to do Peter Griffin. That's not my actual Peter
[30787.91s -> 30812.30s]  Griffin. That's not fair. Ironic. That was being ironic. The new slap. Hey, you don't
[30812.30s -> 30816.63s]  think that shit's intentional? Now I got some embarrassing fucking thing that you guys are all
[30816.63s -> 30821.93s]  sharing. No one's talking about the slap anymore. Pretty good tactic, don't you think?
[30843.96s -> 30854.39s]  All right, our pool room is done. Just need a bed and the floor needs to be done. It's
[30854.39s -> 30860.55s]  gonna be tile up here. If it's a pool, it's gonna be like that pool tile. Like this stuff
[30861.27s -> 30879.40s]  right here. It's not floor tile. God damn it. I thought it was floor. Floor tile. This one
[30879.40s -> 30901.14s]  looks kind of like a pool. No, it kind of sucks. This one? A little bit better. No,
[30901.14s -> 30926.55s]  it's gotta be white. Just classic white. White tile. That's better. You need to have stairs.
[30926.55s -> 30937.48s]  Yeah, I'll put stairs in the pool so you can get up and get up. How much is this costing?
[30937.48s -> 30974.49s]  A lot of money actually. Why do you have a YMCA in your house? Why not? Almost done.
[30974.49s -> 30987.54s]  Kind of awkward because I can't really reach in here. Over here. I'm no longer worth half
[30987.54s -> 30994.47s]  a million. I will be very soon once I sell this place. All right, I can't paint this because it
[30994.47s -> 31004.95s]  is glitched out, but here we go. Nice little pool. Let's actually put this in a different spot.
[31006.15s -> 31020.86s]  I have more room over here. Are we doing the same house? Yeah, we've been on the same house
[31020.86s -> 31030.49s]  for just about nine hours. I've spent what some would consider an entire day on this
[31030.49s -> 31056.81s]  house. An entire day. A whole day. I couldn't be happier with the outcome. What's the most
[31056.81s -> 31081.58s]  expensive painting you have in the game? That's actually pretty cheap. Upload a photo. I did that
[31081.58s -> 31101.64s]  last time and you can make it like 200 million dollars. I thought that was going to be a lot
[31101.64s -> 31124.15s]  bigger. All right. No, we're not going out there yet. You can't see out there. Let's get some
[31124.15s -> 31138.92s]  lights in here. Lamp. Go just like a standard cube lamp. This is fine. Make it like blue to
[31138.92s -> 31159.26s]  match the room. Wait, I need the stove counter. No, I'm not doing a second pool.
[31162.79s -> 31171.94s]  Um, what's it even called? Furniture? Installations? Kitchen? What is it?
[31172.66s -> 31187.13s]  Kitchen cabinet. Here we go. I was saying counter. That looks nice. Let's get a stove in here.
[31187.13s -> 31211.91s]  Let's get, yeah, let's get two of these. Let's do three. Get the stove on there. All right.
[31211.91s -> 31245.42s]  Pretty cool. Wait, why does it look odd? I already have a pizza oven. I don't need
[31245.42s -> 31255.94s]  none. All right. Let's get a light in here. Lamp. Skunk ball. Let's get a few of them
[31255.94s -> 31266.81s]  right up here. These are ugly. These are very ugly, but it's okay. It is light. That's all
[31266.81s -> 31274.52s]  that matters. And I got a lamp there. Let's get some recessed lighting up here, please. Thank
[31274.52s -> 31337.50s]  you. Tube. There we go. This place is ugly as sin. Any lights in here? Yeah, there are.
[31337.50s -> 31347.78s]  This is very ugly. It's very, very, very ugly. But, you know, we're at the end here.
[31347.78s -> 31358.73s]  I'm kind of tired. So are we gonna have a very ugly house? It's okay. It still looks all right.
[31358.73s -> 31381.88s]  It still looks good. All right. Are we ready for the tour? It's time. And I want to do this
[31381.88s -> 31387.61s]  at night and I want to do this at dark. Reverse that. I want to, okay. I want to do
[31387.61s -> 31390.57s]  this at night. I want to do this during the day. Don't look! Nobody look! Don't look at
[31390.57s -> 31405.42s]  nobody look. Okay. I want it to be daytime. There's no lighting in the garden. Oh, it
[31405.42s -> 31459.75s]  doesn't matter. Bed. Bed. I need a bed. Come on. I need just a little thing. There we go.
[31459.75s -> 31484.36s]  Perfect. Nice. Very nice. Wait, that door's open. Doors are closed. Closed. Closed. Closed.
[31484.36s -> 31501.50s]  Closed. Closed. Okay, here we go. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[31501.50s -> 31516.79s]  I'm not gonna play the family guy theme. No. There's the before clip. Let me see it. Oh,
[31516.79s -> 31522.33s]  it looks like shit. I'm just gonna have this loop silently so you can understand what's
[31522.33s -> 31544.73s]  going on here. Let me just get it on screen. Did anybody get any? I really do want like
[31544.73s -> 31547.13s]  screenshots though. So I'm gonna put time into this. I'm gonna make this real.
[31551.24s -> 31569.30s]  All right. Here is the before. Take a look at this dump. Trash everywhere. Boards. The whole
[31569.30s -> 31577.24s]  thing was condemned. Weeds growing all over the place. It was uninhabitable. This is the front
[31577.24s -> 31586.58s]  door right here. Dumpster over here on the right-hand side. You've got just dead grass.
[31586.58s -> 31602.33s]  Looks terrible. I was ashamed. But now. But now I am no longer ashamed. Here's what we have
[31602.33s -> 31622.38s]  here now. Let's take a walk to that right side where that dumpster was. Remember that dumpster?
[31622.38s -> 31631.83s]  Now it is a stone walkway with a nice picnic area for you and your kids. All that trash.
[31631.83s -> 31641.69s]  Nice fresh grass. We have a windmill farm here in the garden taking us to the right.
[31642.33s -> 31649.34s]  Some more little flowers there. Fucking door was open. When I do my tours,
[31650.30s -> 31656.23s]  you close all the goddamn doors. Through here we have the viewing area. This used to be with,
[31656.23s -> 31659.90s]  you know, as you can see. I'll put it back on the screen just so you can see just how bad
[31659.90s -> 31667.08s]  it was. Take a look at this right side here. Now there's a couch. Now there is a projector.
[31667.08s -> 31684.52s]  Two pizza ovens. Looks a lot different doesn't it? Looks much better. Yeah there's an outdoor
[31684.52s -> 31694.71s]  projection TV. Man but look at this backyard. Look at where we are. Fresh green. Trees. An
[31694.71s -> 31709.29s]  outdoor patio. A grill. A pool. A little kiddie pool. Completely redone. A fresh pond
[31709.29s -> 31715.08s]  with our little friends here. And our little group of flowers over there. We got a little
[31715.08s -> 31726.78s]  birdhouse. Small garden over here. Smoking area for those of you that smoke. Only smoke out
[31726.78s -> 31734.46s]  here please. And nowhere else. Letting us out to the garage area. This is the driveway.
[31734.46s -> 31751.50s]  Take a look at that. How do I turn the damn hut off? Another pond here. Hammock. I think
[31751.50s -> 31765.86s]  it looks phenomenal. Fresh driveway yeah? I'm like no I'm not crouching again. Can I go inside
[31765.86s -> 31803.88s]  the garage? Yeah just a second. All right in the garage we have nothing actually because
[31803.88s -> 31811.74s]  there was nothing built. There was something in there. Not letting the dog live inside. The
[31811.74s -> 31829.86s]  dog does live inside. Never mind. No what do I? No! Close this. Go back out. So let's take
[31829.86s -> 31843.18s]  a look inside your new home. You don't have to knock here. You own the place. Come on in.
[31843.26s -> 31855.14s]  This is yours. Close the door behind you so don't get too much drafty in here. Ah close that to
[31855.14s -> 31880.46s]  your left. Your space. Your area. Gaming lounge. You got three connections here. That seems like a
[31880.46s -> 31887.22s]  lot of cable. For what? Pretty believable off believable is the word that comes out of my
[31887.22s -> 31897.34s]  brain here. Pretty believable. Can we get a look at what it looked like inside? I don't
[31897.34s -> 31902.68s]  think we have that. We can get that off the screen just so you can you know we don't need
[31902.68s -> 31911.85s]  to see it anymore. Uh if you're wondering is this a joke? Well the no it's not. There actually are
[31911.85s -> 31917.42s]  toilet plumbing here. I just want to make sure I proved it to you in case you just didn't believe
[31917.42s -> 31927.58s]  me. Which I don't know why you wouldn't. Hold on just give me one minute. I gotta reinstall
[31927.58s -> 31935.72s]  the toilet here. Uh this is here for any family guy jokes that you'd like to make
[31936.28s -> 31940.44s]  or if you want to be at the table and use the bathroom at the same time. It's very
[31940.44s -> 31947.72s]  possible. Here's your kitchen area. You have uh right here this is a very interesting fridge.
[31947.72s -> 31951.80s]  Uh this is the fridge that uh one person over the last eight and a half nine hours
[31951.80s -> 31962.86s]  told me to put the red fridge in the game uh every 14 minutes. Get it finally. Over here
[31962.86s -> 31977.78s]  you got your stove and your freeze musical cabinets. Microwave for those nights that you
[31977.78s -> 31988.02s]  just don't feel like cooking. There's a no oven. No oven. Well we passed the two pizza
[31988.02s -> 32001.00s]  ovens so but the real treat is up the stairs. Careful now slowly. Okay okay you can take the
[32001.00s -> 32007.96s]  blindfold off because up here oh wait no fuck um no no no no come back downstairs come back
[32007.96s -> 32013.13s]  downstairs come back downstairs all the way back outside god damn it. Why'd they have a fucking
[32013.13s -> 32021.02s]  blindfold on you? Okay take take take the blindfold off and look at what you see. Didn't

[32137.37s -> 32171.37s]  worth. What is your house worth? American Crop English. Modern. I got five stars for the layout.
[32171.37s -> 32187.00s]  I mean zero. This you can't even get this on Yelp. That's not fair. And I picked the wrong
[32187.00s -> 32192.97s]  category wrong category wrong no no don't do not. Reparticipate in the garden competition
[32192.97s -> 32221.38s]  in 10 minutes. Is it 10? It's 10 real life? What does that say?

[32268.79s -> 32285.43s]  I'm gonna try again. So this is gonna be 10 hours. This might actually be it's it's been a
[32285.43s -> 32295.70s]  while since I've done 10 hours. Move the office here? I absolutely will move the office here.
[32296.34s -> 32311.03s]  I had a perfect opportunity to do like a pretend Skype with grandma show her the house thing.
[32311.67s -> 32319.13s]  Okay you're walking up. You see grandma? This is the neighborhood. Oh wow that looks great.
[32320.44s -> 32326.22s]  What's that over there on the right side? Oh here here. I want to see that.

[32371.66s -> 32382.90s]  room. All right let's do the bits. I will see you guys later. What's today? It's Friday.
[32383.54s -> 32394.94s]  Can't sell it? You can sell it. I'll just move my office back to the dump. That's fine.

[32407.72s -> 32410.44s]  Sell it now? I but I want to do the garden thing again. I feel like I picked the wrong
[32410.44s -> 32420.14s]  one. It's only like 10 minutes. We've been here for nine hours. What's another eight
[32420.14s -> 32437.03s]  minutes? So what we'll probably do is this one will take us to about 10 plus hours.
[32437.83s -> 32442.44s]  I'll probably just I'll probably take tomorrow off and then we'll come back on Sunday.
[32443.24s -> 32450.95s]  Technically well today is Saturday technically right so Saturday is technically now
[32453.18s -> 32470.97s]  so Sunday so tomorrow technically which is Sunday. Yeah or maybe I don't know maybe not.
[32470.97s -> 32478.39s]  Maybe. Maybe we'll just go tomorrow. It depends. Depends on what time I fall asleep
[32478.39s -> 32491.66s]  and get up you know. Let me see what's going on tomorrow morning. Come back in 10 minutes.
[32495.43s -> 32503.22s]  Yeah we'll see. I mean if tomorrow my you know my energy's up I'm good. I do have to plan

[33829.48s -> 33833.72s]  cup in the back of my hood I didn't know it was there so walking around talking to
[33833.72s -> 33840.58s]  employees of this place and finally after like it was at least like 10 to 20 straight
[33840.58s -> 33846.18s]  minutes or so I don't know maybe less than that of me looking like a dickhead I just have an empty
[33846.18s -> 33851.62s]  coffee cup in my hood and I'm like walking around oh can you show me like the i7 4770k please
[33851.62s -> 33855.94s]  oh yeah sure right this way sir they just I had to I walked in front of him at least a few
[33855.94s -> 33865.91s]  times I didn't know we put it in there so eventually I he was laughing or I don't know
[33865.91s -> 33870.55s]  somebody was looking somebody was looking at it or I feel it was there I knew it was there
[33871.19s -> 33874.47s]  and I just grabbed it we were with a bunch of like employees and a couple of managers because
[33874.47s -> 33879.67s]  they had to get the key to open up the thing to get like the cpu processor or whatever a
[33879.67s -> 33883.19s]  graphics card and I just grabbed the coffee cup and I looked at him I said you're a
[33883.19s -> 33891.72s]  fucking asshole and then everybody stopped and it was just like whoa and I was like no I
[33891.72s -> 33898.49s]  did like what I just I called it like a fucking asshole oh well I was like oh you're
[33898.49s -> 33907.90s]  a fucking prick it was something like that no like yeah in a jacket like in my hood
[33915.02s -> 33925.94s]  something he's got a photographic memory I mean I remember a lot of things and I don't know he
[33925.94s -> 33931.80s]  thought it was the funniest thing ever because I was I shut the whole store out I turned off all
[33931.80s -> 33938.81s]  the manager all the managers faces I went like whoa holy fuck and like 10 seconds later we were
[33938.81s -> 33948.84s]  fine it was just like oh so what's the i7 70 oh yeah right here hey that's crazy I remember
[33948.84s -> 33954.55s]  things too can you believe it we have a superpower we already went over this but thank

[33962.60s -> 33972.04s]  gardening while spy crabbing I can't believe I spent a majority of the stream crouched
[33972.04s -> 33981.66s]  that's unbelievable it had to have been at least a few hours at the very least but thank
[33981.66s -> 33986.90s]  you almost to the end of the bits and then we'll do the garden contest sell the house
[33987.62s -> 33996.57s]  while we run the credits uh thank you cad cad btv 250 honey I think the real estate

[34033.83s -> 34044.95s]  bad welcome though thank you smelly boy I've always wondered if you guys you like star
[34044.95s -> 34049.67s]  italics call each other by your real names outside of the streams it's actually kind of
[34049.67s -> 34062.12s]  hard it's kind of hard to do to do that it's weird to explain that but I I call like for instance um
[34063.06s -> 34070.22s]  orb you guys know incredible orb right he was here for edc and we hung out he's the person
[34070.22s -> 34075.21s]  that I picked up from the airport I think did I say that or maybe I didn't uh because he's an
[34075.21s -> 34084.06s]  old friend we know each other for a long time but I don't I call him orb it's just orb hey
[34084.06s -> 34098.79s]  what's up orb I call him it's just it just that's all I've known him as my friends call
[34098.79s -> 34103.59s]  each other by our online names my sister and her husband too it's not weird not that weird
[34103.59s -> 34115.77s]  it's understand it's almost like a nickname it's a nickname that has been um it's almost like
[34115.77s -> 34119.77s]  you know in the game of thrones like oh you're a bastard but I could make you uh like you
[34119.77s -> 34127.37s]  maybe in the world of like a song of ice and fire right a king can make somebody well
[34127.77s -> 34137.45s]  you're no longer like this person I'm going to name you you can be like named back in like the old
[34137.45s -> 34145.40s]  like 1400s you could be like named to have like your actual name instead of just be you know the
[34145.40s -> 34150.34s]  your online id this is a really bad analogy I think I'm too tired to explain this because
[34150.34s -> 34153.54s]  I here's what happened I'll tell you exactly what just happened right there so I was just
[34153.54s -> 34157.05s]  talking about I didn't want to like go off in a game of thrones because I was terrified that
[34157.05s -> 34160.41s]  I didn't want to like have anybody say anything because I mean the show just ended so I
[34160.41s -> 34164.73s]  started to talk about like a real a really good analogy but like I didn't want to talk about the
[34164.73s -> 34170.12s]  show so then I was like I was like so I have a bit of an evil so I don't want to talk about
[34170.12s -> 34182.84s]  that and then I kind of gave up 1400s is medieval times so I didn't want to like
[34182.84s -> 34186.68s]  have people talk about like oh game of thrones let's talk about that you know what I'm saying
[34190.18s -> 34195.38s]  long story short uh it's not like that weird I don't think to call somebody people come
[34195.38s -> 34199.70s]  in germa all the time even like personal friends of mine but even before being online
[34200.98s -> 34213.18s]  germa germa hey what's up germ like my father my like parents call me that hey germ so I mean it's
[34213.18s -> 34230.01s]  not out of the ordinary thing I don't think yeah it's just a nickname the infection is spreading
[34230.01s -> 34235.56s]  all right we only got a couple more we got uh cad btv for the 250 I can't wait for the
[34235.56s -> 34240.28s]  colonoscopy stream here's a working title down the germa hole you can have that one for free
