[18.23s -> 27.43s]  See, I'm here. I turned it on. I turned it on.
[27.43s -> 30.55s]  Yeah, we were troubleshooting. We were making sure we could get in the party,
[30.55s -> 36.52s]  and that we could get everything ready, and yeah. I'm here.
[36.52s -> 43.48s]  Hi. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna leave. I'll be right back. I forgot to make a coffee.
[44.65s -> 47.61s]  Everyone's just starting their streams now, or we're getting ready.
[47.61s -> 48.97s]  Let me go over what's happening today.
[50.12s -> 52.94s]  Hi. We're gonna be playing some Man vs Machine.
[53.82s -> 58.79s]  Team Fortress. Something I've been kind of wanting to do for a few months,
[58.79s -> 61.51s]  I feel like, at least six or seven weeks.
[62.47s -> 66.07s]  We've got a crew. This is the crew that we've been
[66.71s -> 68.95s]  kind of communicating for the last month or so about this.
[70.95s -> 80.84s]  Sans one person, but we have Dug Dug, Ludwig, Poke, Stir, and Vinny Vinesauce.
[81.66s -> 85.03s]  Quite the crew. And me!
[87.27s -> 89.11s]  Yeah, should be fun. Looking forward to it.
[89.67s -> 95.91s]  I have not... I tested this last night, but I've not really gone completely into
[95.91s -> 98.87s]  Man vs Machine in years. It's been at least five years.
[99.85s -> 105.51s]  So I'm excited to at least play it, fill out a party, have some fun.
[106.70s -> 108.54s]  Yeah, give me one second. I'm gonna be right back.
[108.54s -> 112.06s]  I'm gonna just make my coffee, and I'm gonna be the last one that comes back, probably.
[112.70s -> 116.78s]  So when everyone's making fun of me and calling me all kinds of names,
[116.78s -> 119.98s]  just remember I'm getting a coffee, and you can communicate that.
[119.98s -> 121.26s]  All right, I'll be right back.
[121.26s -> 226.87s]  I am back. Check on everybody else.
[227.67s -> 231.45s]  Is anybody here?
[232.09s -> 234.14s]  Forgot there's only six guests. Oh, hello!
[234.14s -> 236.06s]  Hey! Oh, perfect timing.
[236.06s -> 237.08s]  How you doing?
[237.08s -> 237.88s]  Good.
[237.88s -> 238.76s]  What's happening? How you doing?
[239.32s -> 240.04s]  I'm nervous.
[240.76s -> 241.88s]  Don't be. We'll be fine.
[242.60s -> 243.96s]  I've never played before.
[246.10s -> 246.34s]  Okay.
[246.34s -> 246.74s]  Hello.
[247.30s -> 248.90s]  Let's help Ludwig out.
[249.46s -> 250.02s]  Okay.
[250.02s -> 251.38s]  What if I'm bad, Jerma?
[251.38s -> 252.74s]  You won't be bad. I promise.
[252.74s -> 254.18s]  What if I get the team killed?
[255.62s -> 257.62s]  Well, that's gonna... people are gonna do that on purpose to you anyways.
[258.79s -> 259.11s]  What?
[259.11s -> 260.39s]  It's gonna be like a funny ha-ha.
[260.39s -> 260.95s]  Funny we got you.
[260.95s -> 262.15s]  I'm already stressed out. Don't do that.
[262.15s -> 263.11s]  That's not a funny ha-ha for me.
[263.11s -> 264.07s]  It's a stressful ha-ha.
[266.02s -> 266.90s]  Okay, so the Scout.
[267.54s -> 269.06s]  He's the first class.
[269.06s -> 270.66s]  He runs really fast.
[270.66s -> 272.82s]  He has Bonk Atomic Punch.
[272.82s -> 274.98s]  When he drinks it, he becomes invincible.
[274.98s -> 275.94s]  Very important to know.
[276.74s -> 277.22s]  The Soldier.
[277.22s -> 278.34s]  Can I ask you a question?
[278.34s -> 278.58s]  Yeah.
[279.14s -> 281.14s]  Without... because I don't need to know the classes.
[281.14s -> 284.02s]  I just want to know what you think I am.
[284.02s -> 285.54s]  Just, like, soak me in.
[289.24s -> 289.56s]  Hmm.
[290.44s -> 290.68s]  Interesting.
[290.68s -> 292.68s]  He's the first member of the DK crew.
[292.68s -> 293.88s]  So I would go Lanky Kong.
[294.68s -> 295.08s]  Okay?
[295.64s -> 295.96s]  Okay.
[298.09s -> 299.53s]  I know I'm being helpful right now, but...
[299.53s -> 300.73s]  People are saying Pyro.
[300.73s -> 302.57s]  People are saying that you're probably a Pyro.
[303.96s -> 305.72s]  Well, I'm a Pyro, so...
[305.72s -> 306.52s]  Or a Heavy.
[306.52s -> 307.96s]  Heavy Weapon Guy could be good.
[307.96s -> 309.40s]  Why are we talking about this like it's...
[311.16s -> 312.92s]  like astrology?
[312.92s -> 314.20s]  It feels like a sorting hat.
[314.20s -> 315.08s]  Like Harry Potter.
[315.80s -> 318.04s]  Like, oh, are you a Virgo?
[318.68s -> 320.12s]  Wait, I'm gonna do a BuzzFeed quiz.
[322.60s -> 322.92s]  Really?
[323.56s -> 324.52s]  Yeah, BuzzFeed.
[324.52s -> 325.72s]  What TF2 character are you?
[326.44s -> 327.48s]  All right, well, let's see.
[327.48s -> 327.96s]  Let's hear it.
[330.81s -> 332.89s]  Are there more than five questions on that list?
[332.89s -> 333.53s]  Which...
[333.53s -> 335.13s]  There are 14 questions.
[335.13s -> 336.49s]  It is quite thorough.
[336.49s -> 337.29s]  Yeah.
[337.29s -> 338.89s]  I'll link the one I'm looking at here.
[341.51s -> 342.55s]  Um, okay.
[342.55s -> 343.35s]  I'm gonna go through this.
[343.35s -> 344.95s]  I'll tell you what agent I get in a bit.
[344.95s -> 347.19s]  I kind of feel like you're kind of a spy too, though.
[347.19s -> 347.67s]  Don't you think?
[352.30s -> 353.90s]  Mission begins in 30 seconds.
[353.90s -> 355.98s]  The first round of a payload map is starting.
[355.98s -> 358.54s]  You loaded late and everyone else has picked a team.
[358.54s -> 359.50s]  The game is 8v8.
[359.50s -> 360.70s]  Which team do you choose?
[360.70s -> 362.22s]  These are really detailed questions.
[362.22s -> 363.58s]  Yeah, these are a lot of answers.
[364.22s -> 367.82s]  These questions are also based on TF2 gameplay.
[367.82s -> 369.82s]  Okay, also, I don't want to make anybody upset or anything,
[369.82s -> 373.22s]  but while we're hanging out, I've got a few crates to open.
[373.22s -> 377.85s]  I'll get off of some crates just while we're just sitting,
[377.85s -> 378.81s]  we're just hanging out.
[378.81s -> 380.62s]  We're just hanging out.
[380.62s -> 382.14s]  I know why you live in Vegas now.
[383.51s -> 383.99s]  Yeah.
[383.99s -> 384.55s]  Makes sense.
[384.55s -> 385.19s]  Yeah, it makes sense.
[386.28s -> 391.43s]  Okay, so I do need help while we wait for the other three to be ready.
[391.43s -> 393.67s]  I have a ton of cases in crates.
[393.67s -> 395.58s]  I opened up some before.
[395.58s -> 397.02s]  Should I even open these?
[397.02s -> 398.30s]  Or are these dog shit?
[398.30s -> 399.02s]  I don't know.
[399.02s -> 400.30s]  I have no idea what's in these.
[400.30s -> 403.13s]  Are these stupid?
[403.13s -> 408.54s]  Should I not open these?
[408.54s -> 409.18s]  Open them.
[409.18s -> 410.14s]  Yeah, but which one?
[410.14s -> 414.87s]  Because I know that some of the crate series are terrible, right?
[414.87s -> 416.23s]  83 is good.
[416.23s -> 417.91s]  If you guys have no idea what I'm talking about in the call,
[419.19s -> 422.39s]  TF2 invented the idea of opening boxes for items.
[423.75s -> 425.35s]  And the world has been worse ever since.
[425.35s -> 425.91s]  It's all their fault.
[426.55s -> 428.94s]  But hey, kind of fun.
[428.94s -> 429.98s]  Let's do it.
[429.98s -> 432.31s]  All right, 83.
[432.31s -> 433.27s]  All right, I'm going for it.
[433.27s -> 435.48s]  Let's go 83.
[439.03s -> 440.31s]  Unusual right now.
[440.31s -> 445.53s]  All right, I already have one of these.
[447.05s -> 448.09s]  We opening boxes?
[449.10s -> 450.22s]  Just to kill some time.
[450.22s -> 451.34s]  I only have a few.
[451.34s -> 453.75s]  Not just to kill some time.
[453.75s -> 457.27s]  Just fucking throwing some keys in these crates.
[457.27s -> 462.97s]  All right, is it weird that I want the strange flog item?
[462.97s -> 464.17s]  I want to open that one.
[464.17s -> 472.10s]  Strange flog, come on.
[472.10s -> 478.09s]  Oh, holy shit.
[478.09s -> 480.62s]  But why do you have evil villain hair?
[480.62s -> 483.22s]  I told you I'm trying to be as gross as possible.
[483.22s -> 492.60s]  I'm trying to grow my hair up like a long and just be fucking disgusting.
[492.60s -> 493.32s]  Just one crate.
[493.32s -> 494.68s]  They want me to open crates now.
[494.68s -> 494.92s]  I'm not.
[495.64s -> 497.72s]  I don't want to do not do not.
[497.72s -> 499.32s]  There's no don't.
[499.32s -> 500.12s]  It's just.
[500.12s -> 503.03s]  Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of cool.
[503.03s -> 504.39s]  I've got a lot of items, Jerma.
[504.39s -> 507.03s]  But a lot of this is like classic stuff or stuff people gave to me.
[507.03s -> 508.79s]  So I'm good.
[508.79s -> 510.90s]  Is that OK?
[510.90s -> 513.88s]  And Ludwig has literally all the stock items.
[513.88s -> 515.00s]  Yeah, it'll be fine.
[515.64s -> 517.48s]  He'll get some while we're playing.
[517.48s -> 519.67s]  No, that's true.
[519.67s -> 519.91s]  All right.
[519.91s -> 520.79s]  What about this one here?
[520.79s -> 521.99s]  This like spider one.
[522.49s -> 524.87s]  I'm going to open this one.
[524.87s -> 525.11s]  Yeah.
[525.11s -> 529.29s]  And I was a little I wanted to make it nice looking.
[529.29s -> 532.63s]  I matched it.
[532.63s -> 537.48s]  Chad, this is not a great little mask.
[537.48s -> 538.28s]  That's pretty.
[538.28s -> 539.24s]  Oh, OK.
[539.24s -> 540.20s]  That's pretty cool.
[540.20s -> 541.19s]  All right.
[541.19s -> 543.43s]  Are we am I like just wasting time?
[543.43s -> 543.91s]  Are we OK?
[543.91s -> 545.19s]  Are we like just still hanging out?
[545.83s -> 547.67s]  Everyone's doing an intro still, I think.
[547.67s -> 547.91s]  All right.
[547.91s -> 551.27s]  I'm just making sure that I'm not like everyone's like, what the fuck is he doing?
[551.27s -> 552.47s]  I thought we went to play man versus machine.
[552.47s -> 553.43s]  He's opening crates.
[555.54s -> 557.14s]  Now they're all doing their own thing.
[557.14s -> 563.32s]  Yeah.
[563.32s -> 565.48s]  Give me an unusual.
[565.48s -> 566.04s]  What is that?
[567.94s -> 570.44s]  Cabinet man is like a little game.
[571.24s -> 574.76s]  Do I have to buy keys now?
[574.76s -> 575.32s]  God damn it.
[575.88s -> 580.36s]  I was just going to double.
[580.36s -> 581.48s]  Wait, what did I get?
[581.48s -> 585.86s]  Oh, it's Halloween only.
[585.86s -> 586.42s]  OK.
[586.42s -> 590.79s]  Who's this for?
[590.79s -> 595.59s]  Engineer.
[595.59s -> 596.15s]  No, check.
[596.15s -> 596.87s]  It's going to be great.
[596.87s -> 597.83s]  Give me give me a minute here.
[597.83s -> 599.27s]  Let me buy a couple of keys.
[599.27s -> 601.27s]  That's actually fucking awesome.
[601.27s -> 605.69s]  I wish I could have this on right now, but I can't.
[605.69s -> 606.09s]  Are you?
[606.09s -> 606.81s]  Oh, yeah.
[606.81s -> 608.89s]  I mean, just make sure you don't do that on camera.
[608.89s -> 609.29s]  Oh, I know.
[609.29s -> 609.53s]  I know.
[609.53s -> 609.93s]  I know.
[609.93s -> 611.10s]  Yeah.
[611.10s -> 612.30s]  Yeah.
[612.30s -> 614.30s]  Don't don't show them how much how much you're buying.
[614.30s -> 617.56s]  Make it a mystery.
[617.56s -> 618.28s]  That's amazing.
[618.28s -> 619.43s]  I love it.
[619.43s -> 619.59s]  Yeah.
[619.59s -> 620.23s]  What's going on?
[620.23s -> 621.11s]  We're buying cases.
[622.07s -> 626.39s]  I just had a few left over while people were doing intros.
[626.39s -> 630.84s]  What's a what's a rare case that I wish I knew?
[630.84s -> 634.14s]  There's like there's like 200 of them at this point.
[634.14s -> 634.78s]  It won't let me.
[634.78s -> 635.50s]  I bought the keys.
[635.50s -> 637.10s]  It won't let me open the case.
[637.10s -> 639.83s]  Did you buy the right keys for the right case?
[639.83s -> 640.95s]  Oh, you may have not.
[640.95s -> 642.15s]  Oh, fuck.
[642.15s -> 644.07s]  You may have bought incorrect keys.
[644.07s -> 644.55s]  Oh, no.
[646.52s -> 648.92s]  I knew I knew I was going to do something wrong.
[651.34s -> 652.62s]  Oopsie.
[652.70s -> 655.75s]  Yeah, there's there's a million different keys.
[655.75s -> 657.03s]  Yeah, they did.
[657.03s -> 660.02s]  Why did they do that, by the way?
[660.02s -> 662.07s]  Uh, I don't know.
[662.07s -> 662.79s]  I wish they did.
[662.79s -> 665.51s]  They're like not even in my inventory with the keys.
[665.51s -> 667.59s]  What happened?
[667.59s -> 668.15s]  All right.
[668.15s -> 668.79s]  Whatever.
[668.79s -> 669.91s]  This is silly.
[669.91s -> 671.75s]  This is all silly business.
[671.75s -> 673.59s]  I have a pending item alert.
[673.59s -> 678.63s]  If you bought them from the market, then you would have to, like, accept the alert.
[678.63s -> 680.63s]  Uh, you might need to restart your game.
[680.63s -> 684.01s]  It's possible, you know, also possible.
[684.01s -> 686.97s]  I don't want to leave the party.
[686.97s -> 688.25s]  So, oh, Doug just went offline.
[689.05s -> 691.70s]  If you leave the game, you don't leave the party.
[691.70s -> 692.82s]  OK, I'll try.
[692.82s -> 693.86s]  I'll give it one shot.
[693.86s -> 700.66s]  Let's see if I get a good item here, because, you know, my chat is like desperate for me
[700.66s -> 701.86s]  to like open items now.
[704.62s -> 713.38s]  What the summer of September?
[714.02s -> 715.78s]  Yes, that's when the event is over.
[716.68s -> 718.65s]  Oh, I like that.
[718.65s -> 719.45s]  I already have this.
[720.01s -> 723.10s]  I already have that.
[723.10s -> 724.06s]  No, I don't chat.
[724.06s -> 725.10s]  I got the keys.
[725.10s -> 729.19s]  I think I hope these are the right ones.
[729.19s -> 729.43s]  Fuck.
[729.43s -> 731.03s]  They're still not the right ones.
[733.21s -> 734.65s]  Is this just like Twitch streamers?
[734.65s -> 738.01s]  They get together for a fun night of games, and then everyone just sits around and gambles
[738.01s -> 738.73s]  for like an hour.
[739.77s -> 742.73s]  Like, but not even gambling, like, appropriately.
[742.73s -> 744.49s]  Like, I'm failing at gambling.
[744.49s -> 746.01s]  And then we all go to bed at eight.
[746.57s -> 749.69s]  Can you imagine, like, going to Vegas, going to the blackjack table and like, sorry, you
[749.69s -> 750.81s]  don't have the right key.
[750.81s -> 753.21s]  You have to go get the Australian keys from over there.
[754.60s -> 756.36s]  Yeah, it's like a bunch of different currencies.
[756.92s -> 759.40s]  How many barriers to entry of like, I just want to give you money.
[759.40s -> 760.76s]  It's like, oh, cool, blackjack.
[760.76s -> 762.12s]  Oh, there's five open seats.
[762.12s -> 763.56s]  This is fucking perfect.
[763.56s -> 764.12s]  Oh, everybody.
[764.12s -> 764.60s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[764.60s -> 765.16s]  Everybody got your drink.
[765.16s -> 765.64s]  Yeah, sit down.
[765.64s -> 766.20s]  Let's go.
[766.20s -> 767.16s]  It's like, I'm sorry, sir.
[767.16s -> 768.98s]  This is yen.
[768.98s -> 770.02s]  Oh, this is a yen.
[770.02s -> 770.90s]  This is a yen table.
[771.46s -> 775.46s]  Oh, I see that one requires a different key, even though there's five of them.
[775.46s -> 779.75s]  Not seat is for the summer crates.
[779.75s -> 782.87s]  You have to be wearing like swim trunks to sit here.
[782.87s -> 784.39s]  I can open this chat.
[784.39s -> 787.59s]  It's a man co supply crate number 43.
[787.59s -> 790.71s]  Dude, that's an old one that actually might be worth something.
[790.71s -> 791.59s]  Some of the old ones.
[792.23s -> 794.71s]  The reason the burning captains and stuff are worth so much is
[794.71s -> 796.89s]  because the crates don't drop anymore.
[796.89s -> 797.93s]  I got a rare germ.
[797.93s -> 800.65s]  I got a Berliner's bucket helm.
[801.21s -> 802.81s]  Oh, what do you got?
[802.81s -> 803.77s]  Oh, you opening crates?
[805.32s -> 808.01s]  This is the stream now.
[808.65s -> 811.96s]  Hey, it's actually.
[812.52s -> 815.75s]  Look, here's the thing about this, though.
[815.75s -> 818.71s]  Like technical difficulties.
[818.71s -> 820.87s]  We can just open crates until we're ready.
[820.87s -> 821.99s]  This is perfect.
[821.99s -> 822.95s]  This is actually.
[822.95s -> 825.83s]  Honestly, I think we should just open crates for four hours.
[825.83s -> 827.83s]  We just open which is great opening.
[827.83s -> 828.87s]  That's like fun for me, too.
[828.87s -> 829.19s]  Like that.
[829.19s -> 830.54s]  I'm fine with that.
[830.54s -> 834.46s]  I had the highest viewership that I've ever had last week when I opened crates,
[834.46s -> 837.42s]  like by far the least creative and worst stream I've ever done.
[838.06s -> 841.50s]  It was peak viewership for a non collab stream.
[841.50s -> 844.38s]  What if I watch you open crates?
[844.38s -> 845.50s]  Oh, that's good.
[845.50s -> 847.50s]  That will get I think that would do really well.
[847.50s -> 851.67s]  All right, what about we if we get the five of us to pour all of our audiences
[851.67s -> 853.59s]  into one crate opening stream?
[853.59s -> 854.95s]  I think that would be a victory.
[854.95s -> 860.70s]  And we all we all just sit around one person opening and we all just we all get a bunch
[860.70s -> 864.54s]  of crates like 5000 and we all just sit around just screaming every time one opens.
[864.54s -> 868.49s]  I know you're joking, but I would 100% pivot to that right now.
[868.49s -> 871.80s]  Well, I'm opening a 2013 crate right now.
[871.80s -> 877.11s]  This crate was from 2013 and I got the bald eagle.
[877.11s -> 882.84s]  I don't know what that is.
[882.84s -> 887.64s]  Now, chat, I can't right click the crate and get a key because I have the steam overlay
[887.64s -> 890.95s]  off and I have to restart the game again.
[890.95s -> 892.23s]  But I mean, who are we waiting for?
[892.23s -> 895.24s]  Is everyone still like, what are we doing?
[895.24s -> 897.34s]  They're doing their stream intro still.
[897.34s -> 899.98s]  I think Doug had some audio problems.
[899.98s -> 901.26s]  So we're just waiting for.
[901.26s -> 902.14s]  Oh, OK.
[902.14s -> 903.02s]  Yeah, are you good?
[903.02s -> 903.82s]  But I'm all good now.
[903.82s -> 904.54s]  Yeah.
[904.54s -> 906.30s]  And then what about Ludd?
[906.30s -> 908.42s]  Is Ludd doing all right?
[908.42s -> 911.14s]  Oh, Ludd was still doing the BuzzFeed quiz.
[911.14s -> 914.55s]  What do you think he's going to?
[914.55s -> 916.57s]  I think he's going to get spy.
[916.57s -> 917.85s]  Hello, I've gotten my role.
[917.85s -> 918.49s]  Oh, OK.
[918.49s -> 920.38s]  So is it what is it?
[920.38s -> 921.93s]  I am a sniper.
[921.93s -> 923.37s]  Oh, oh, OK.
[924.36s -> 926.76s]  What you guys said that like I'm gay and you're conservative.
[927.64s -> 928.60s]  All right.
[928.60s -> 929.32s]  That's good, man.
[931.32s -> 933.80s]  I'm proud of you no matter what you play, Ludwig.
[933.80s -> 934.76s]  Thank you, honey.
[934.76s -> 937.80s]  Just going to unlock the jar of piss or mom.
[939.29s -> 942.09s]  Well, I said, honey, which wouldn't make sense if I was coming out.
[944.50s -> 945.46s]  What is wrong with sniper?
[945.46s -> 946.18s]  Be real.
[946.18s -> 946.98s]  No, sniper is great.
[946.98s -> 948.58s]  Sniper is my favorite class.
[949.14s -> 949.78s]  It's great class.
[950.34s -> 955.70s]  It's tough in man versus machine because we're fighting hordes of robots and it's better at
[955.78s -> 959.94s]  single target, but it is useful when we're fighting big guys in this mode.
[959.94s -> 960.66s]  So it's not bad.
[960.66s -> 965.30s]  It's just like more situational, whereas Demoman is just going to rip ass the whole time, you know?
[965.30s -> 966.98s]  Well, what are your classes?
[966.98s -> 972.06s]  Are you I bet you guys got some great classes then.
[972.06s -> 978.10s]  I, uh, I think I have a sniper with piss and a bow and arrow.
[978.10s -> 979.22s]  Wait, what is that called?
[981.40s -> 983.16s]  It's called Sniper Sniper.
[983.16s -> 985.50s]  Oh, you're you're a sniper, too.
[985.50s -> 986.78s]  I like to play sniper.
[986.78s -> 990.30s]  Usually I just shoot people with a bow and arrow and I throw piss bottles at them.
[990.30s -> 990.94s]  I'm the scout.
[990.94s -> 993.43s]  Hey, welcome.
[993.43s -> 993.83s]  Okay.
[993.83s -> 994.63s]  Jerma's a scout.
[995.35s -> 996.39s]  What's your class poke?
[998.22s -> 999.86s]  I'll do whatever.
[999.86s -> 1002.50s]  Maybe soldier, but like, you know, everyone has a class.
[1003.06s -> 1006.18s]  Is this what is your personality or what are you playing?
[1006.18s -> 1008.26s]  Because I think some people are confused.
[1008.26s -> 1009.14s]  What's what are you playing?
[1009.14s -> 1010.50s]  I guess more importantly.
[1010.50s -> 1010.82s]  Okay.
[1010.82s -> 1013.40s]  We're all playing sniper.
[1013.40s -> 1013.72s]  Wait.
[1013.72s -> 1017.03s]  Yeah, I'll play sniper.
[1017.03s -> 1018.58s]  I'll play sniper.
[1018.58s -> 1019.86s]  I'll play sniper.
[1019.86s -> 1023.62s]  Is this like the scene in dead poet society?
[1025.06s -> 1025.86s]  I'm the sniper.
[1026.94s -> 1028.46s]  I'll be sniper, too.
[1028.46s -> 1030.06s]  I haven't seen that movie in a while.
[1030.06s -> 1031.58s]  I got a strange equalizer.
[1031.58s -> 1032.46s]  Is that good or bad?
[1032.46s -> 1033.80s]  It's pretty good.
[1033.80s -> 1036.34s]  Oh, you can strange a hat.
[1036.34s -> 1036.90s]  That's weird.
[1038.36s -> 1038.92s]  All right.
[1038.92s -> 1040.78s]  So here's how it's going to work.
[1040.78s -> 1042.14s]  Thanks for coming, everybody.
[1043.26s -> 1044.70s]  Thanks for having us.
[1044.70s -> 1045.90s]  It's going to be a fun time.
[1045.90s -> 1047.26s]  We're going to be playing some man versus machine.
[1047.26s -> 1049.42s]  If you never played before, it's a PVE mode.
[1049.42s -> 1050.78s]  We're not going to be playing as other players.
[1050.78s -> 1053.82s]  We're going to be working together to fight against robots.
[1053.82s -> 1057.30s]  So as we're talking about our roles and what we're going to be doing here,
[1057.30s -> 1061.64s]  I think it's probably good just to kind of get us in.
[1061.64s -> 1063.24s]  We don't have to start the round.
[1063.24s -> 1065.72s]  We can just kind of get in and you can kind of move around.
[1065.72s -> 1069.32s]  You can pick different classes and walk around, shoot the wall for all we need to.
[1071.08s -> 1074.12s]  I do want to make it very clear that we are going to be playing on...
[1075.08s -> 1081.50s]  We had a debate if we were going to do the easy missions or the really hard ones.
[1081.50s -> 1084.70s]  And we've decided we are going to be doing the hard ones.
[1084.70s -> 1088.14s]  So sorry, those of you that may not have much experience.
[1088.14s -> 1090.20s]  It's time to step up.
[1090.20s -> 1092.20s]  Yeah, step up, wussies, right?
[1093.08s -> 1094.04s]  I don't use gendered language.
[1094.04s -> 1096.12s]  But if I did, ooh, would I rip you a new one?
[1099.03s -> 1100.87s]  Just give me an unusual right now so I can put it on
[1100.87s -> 1104.39s]  and just absolutely dunk on these fucking plebs that are in the goddamn call.
[1104.39s -> 1106.84s]  Wait, girls don't have buttholes?
[1106.84s -> 1107.48s]  What? No.
[1107.48s -> 1109.00s]  Keyless immediately.
[1109.00s -> 1110.12s]  Keyless right now.
[1110.12s -> 1110.68s]  Wait.
[1110.68s -> 1113.26s]  OK, we're ready.
[1113.26s -> 1113.66s]  Hold up.
[1114.94s -> 1115.50s]  Hold on.
[1115.50s -> 1115.98s]  Hold on.
[1115.98s -> 1116.54s]  I'm doing it.
[1116.54s -> 1116.86s]  Hold on.
[1116.86s -> 1117.26s]  I'm getting there.
[1117.26s -> 1122.36s]  Hold on.
[1122.36s -> 1122.92s]  Hold on.
[1123.16s -> 1123.48s]  Hold on.
[1125.69s -> 1127.30s]  We'll do an advanced one.
[1127.30s -> 1129.86s]  And we'll just mess around and walk around and take a look at stuff.
[1130.58s -> 1131.86s]  I think I'm going to be the spy.
[1131.86s -> 1132.74s]  I changed my mind.
[1132.74s -> 1134.47s]  I told you.
[1134.47s -> 1136.14s]  I told you he was a spy.
[1136.14s -> 1138.14s]  I have a really good turtleneck for it.
[1138.14s -> 1141.21s]  Yeah, we're going to have a drip contest, too, at the very beginning.
[1141.21s -> 1143.29s]  So make sure you put on your best outfit.
[1143.29s -> 1144.60s]  All right.
[1144.60s -> 1147.30s]  We're doing advanced.
[1147.30s -> 1148.10s]  Yes?
[1148.10s -> 1149.58s]  Yes.
[1149.58s -> 1152.06s]  So we're going to be very happy or very sad about this.
[1152.06s -> 1160.20s]  Chad, I'm going to be Duncan, the big gorilla dude that shoots.
[1160.20s -> 1161.46s]  What's his name?
[1161.46s -> 1161.86s]  Winston?
[1163.32s -> 1164.04s]  Duncan?
[1164.04s -> 1165.50s]  What's his name?
[1168.97s -> 1171.53s]  You mean Winston from Overwatch?
[1171.53s -> 1173.34s]  Oh, I thought it was Duncan.
[1173.34s -> 1174.58s]  Duncan.
[1174.58s -> 1175.22s]  Yeah.
[1175.22s -> 1177.30s]  Duncan is actually meeting right now.
[1177.30s -> 1178.74s]  Like Dunstan checks in.
[1178.74s -> 1179.86s]  That's what I was thinking of.
[1179.86s -> 1180.26s]  Never mind.
[1180.26s -> 1181.30s]  I'm sorry, German.
[1181.30s -> 1182.74s]  I ruined your stream.
[1182.74s -> 1183.30s]  I'm sorry.
[1183.30s -> 1184.58s]  You come on.
[1186.97s -> 1191.13s]  He already gave us performance reviews and told me that jokes were not OK for the stream
[1191.85s -> 1193.13s]  before we started.
[1193.13s -> 1196.02s]  Well, man up, man up, man up, man up.
[1196.02s -> 1196.34s]  All right.
[1196.34s -> 1197.86s]  Everyone pull up your bootstraps.
[1197.86s -> 1199.38s]  OK, so here's how it's going to work.
[1199.38s -> 1202.02s]  What's going to happen is we're going to get into this into this game and we're going to
[1202.02s -> 1202.74s]  be playing game for you.
[1202.74s -> 1207.22s]  I find it hilarious that you guys are taking advice on TF2 from Jerma.
[1207.22s -> 1209.48s]  So let's take it from you then.
[1209.48s -> 1209.80s]  Yeah.
[1209.80s -> 1210.12s]  Yeah.
[1210.12s -> 1210.36s]  I would.
[1210.92s -> 1212.22s]  Lead me then.
[1212.22s -> 1212.86s]  No.
[1212.86s -> 1213.10s]  Yeah.
[1213.10s -> 1213.34s]  Poke.
[1213.90s -> 1214.14s]  Poke.
[1214.14s -> 1214.38s]  Yeah.
[1214.38s -> 1215.02s]  Fuck this guy.
[1215.02s -> 1215.90s]  You know what I mean?
[1215.90s -> 1217.02s]  This game's for children.
[1217.02s -> 1218.06s]  You'll figure it out.
[1218.06s -> 1218.54s]  Hey, Vinny.
[1218.54s -> 1219.42s]  Put your shoes on.
[1219.42s -> 1220.30s]  Pull them up.
[1220.30s -> 1221.26s]  Pull up the shoes.
[1221.26s -> 1223.58s]  Am I crazy to say it's the opposite of for children?
[1224.22s -> 1225.02s]  Oh, my God.
[1225.02s -> 1225.50s]  Vinny, don't listen.
[1225.58s -> 1226.70s]  Watch this movie or no?
[1226.70s -> 1227.82s]  I'm not listening to anyone.
[1227.82s -> 1229.26s]  I'm listening to my heart.
[1229.26s -> 1230.46s]  Vinny, don't listen to Sturr.
[1230.46s -> 1231.26s]  Fuck this guy.
[1231.26s -> 1232.38s]  Ludwig, don't listen to him.
[1232.38s -> 1234.10s]  He thinks he knows TF2.
[1234.10s -> 1236.90s]  I made the TF2 class tutorials back in the day.
[1236.90s -> 1240.66s]  Not him.
[1240.66s -> 1242.33s]  Yeah, we'll see about that.
[1242.33s -> 1245.29s]  I mean, I was playing Team Fortress Classic back in the day.
[1245.29s -> 1248.49s]  So I was I was how I spent most of my high school years.
[1248.49s -> 1251.75s]  Just saying a little different.
[1251.75s -> 1252.79s]  Spamming grenades.
[1252.79s -> 1254.95s]  But I was doing it was making it happen.
[1254.95s -> 1257.11s]  OK, so what do we actually want to play as?
[1257.11s -> 1259.83s]  Because we I'll do whatever.
[1259.83s -> 1260.95s]  I know we're all playing sniper.
[1260.95s -> 1261.59s]  Shit.
[1261.59s -> 1263.19s]  All going to do sniper.
[1263.19s -> 1265.35s]  We actually do have three snipers, don't we?
[1265.35s -> 1267.59s]  This is not a random pub.
[1267.59s -> 1269.51s]  We're supposed to be strategizing.
[1269.51s -> 1270.47s]  I'll go heavy.
[1270.47s -> 1274.47s]  How would you if you wanted to change the class?
[1274.47s -> 1275.03s]  Change it.
[1275.03s -> 1279.75s]  OK, you would press the comma button and that brings a sniper.
[1279.75s -> 1280.47s]  No, this is my role.
[1280.47s -> 1282.38s]  I'm actually never allied.
[1282.38s -> 1284.06s]  Are we all going to be sniper?
[1284.06s -> 1286.78s]  Can we just do it and just laugh for a minute and then go back?
[1286.78s -> 1288.70s]  Look, I did a 30 question quiz.
[1288.70s -> 1291.19s]  It'd be crazy to not follow up on it.
[1291.19s -> 1292.23s]  Yeah, that's true.
[1292.23s -> 1293.19s]  Let me change.
[1293.19s -> 1294.78s]  I don't have the piss.
[1294.78s -> 1295.66s]  Oh, here it is.
[1295.66s -> 1300.25s]  Oh, if you want to change your loadout, it is M.
[1300.25s -> 1304.63s]  I should make my sniper look cool.
[1304.63s -> 1306.65s]  We have three snipers on the squad.
[1306.65s -> 1308.15s]  Oh, yeah, that's what we were doing.
[1308.15s -> 1310.39s]  I think we were doing a little a little goofiness.
[1310.39s -> 1313.40s]  We're getting goofy.
[1313.40s -> 1313.64s]  All right.
[1313.64s -> 1317.00s]  So members, let's I know I'm explaining Andy.
[1317.00s -> 1320.34s]  But listen, there is a counter over here.
[1320.34s -> 1321.14s]  You have money.
[1321.14s -> 1323.22s]  We collect money each wave.
[1323.22s -> 1324.58s]  We get a certain amount of money.
[1324.58s -> 1326.66s]  You use that money to upgrade your character.
[1326.66s -> 1329.62s]  Be careful because everything you do is permanent.
[1329.62s -> 1330.18s]  It is not.
[1330.18s -> 1331.30s]  Actually, that was a lie.
[1331.30s -> 1333.38s]  You can refund all your upgrades in the bottom left.
[1333.38s -> 1334.18s]  I just I forgot.
[1334.18s -> 1336.66s]  OK, so you can refund your upgrades.
[1336.66s -> 1340.04s]  But these are important.
[1340.04s -> 1343.24s]  And everything in your inventory can be upgraded.
[1343.24s -> 1344.68s]  Including your heads only.
[1344.68s -> 1346.60s]  I'm not worried about all this explanation.
[1346.60s -> 1347.88s]  It's just lights out for me.
[1347.88s -> 1353.53s]  Honestly, I like that straight line and you're going to shoot them.
[1353.53s -> 1355.06s]  We're playing machine.
[1355.06s -> 1356.66s]  This is 20 year old AI.
[1356.66s -> 1357.94s]  They can't be that good.
[1357.94s -> 1361.62s]  You know, I like that.
[1361.62s -> 1362.18s]  I like that.
[1362.18s -> 1367.67s]  I actually like that confidence.
[1367.67s -> 1368.23s]  So we do.
[1368.23s -> 1369.99s]  We're doing five snipers, huh?
[1369.99s -> 1371.19s]  I guess that's what we're doing.
[1371.91s -> 1373.51s]  Can someone build a dispenser?
[1373.51s -> 1374.07s]  We can't.
[1374.79s -> 1376.15s]  No, no, no, no.
[1376.15s -> 1377.75s]  On sniper, build a dispenser.
[1377.75s -> 1379.75s]  Someone in my chat said kick the heavy.
[1380.87s -> 1383.91s]  Well, actually, no poke you.
[1383.91s -> 1386.54s]  We could have one heavy that would that would be actually perfect.
[1386.54s -> 1390.25s]  We can do five medics and one heavy and just see what does.
[1390.25s -> 1393.62s]  You want to just all just just heal poke.
[1393.62s -> 1396.18s]  That's kind of fun.
[1396.18s -> 1397.06s]  I'll do it.
[1397.06s -> 1399.46s]  We have no scout either.
[1399.46s -> 1400.34s]  All right, let's look.
[1400.34s -> 1401.46s]  OK, let's get out there.
[1402.42s -> 1403.54s]  Do your upgrades.
[1403.54s -> 1405.32s]  Put me in, coach.
[1405.32s -> 1406.12s]  Put me in.
[1406.12s -> 1407.64s]  And look at the top.
[1407.64s -> 1409.32s]  That is the classes that are coming out there.
[1409.32s -> 1409.80s]  Scout.
[1409.80s -> 1410.84s]  It's a fast class.
[1410.84s -> 1412.04s]  The first class in the slot.
[1412.04s -> 1413.80s]  Number one can move pretty quickly.
[1413.80s -> 1415.16s]  Has bonk atomic punch.
[1415.16s -> 1418.68s]  I find it strange that people standing in spawn have toggled ready.
[1418.68s -> 1421.37s]  Start my countdown timer.
[1421.37s -> 1423.03s]  Wait, so should I be sniper?
[1423.03s -> 1424.31s]  What's wrong with spawn?
[1424.31s -> 1425.19s]  I'm a sniper.
[1425.19s -> 1426.47s]  We have to be out there.
[1426.47s -> 1427.59s]  There's a wave of it.
[1427.59s -> 1429.03s]  I'm the only person out here.
[1429.03s -> 1430.07s]  I'm the only person here.
[1430.87s -> 1432.31s]  I'll be out here in the front there.
[1432.31s -> 1433.99s]  All the bots are coming from one place.
[1433.99s -> 1435.03s]  They come from one direction.
[1435.03s -> 1435.99s]  They see the track.
[1435.99s -> 1439.21s]  See these little these little dollops on the ground.
[1439.21s -> 1441.29s]  This is the path that they take.
[1441.29s -> 1442.58s]  How do you use the canteen?
[1442.58s -> 1443.06s]  The second class.
[1443.06s -> 1444.90s]  Didn't you guys study for this?
[1444.90s -> 1448.58s]  He has four rockets, but that's not always the case because he might have a couple of
[1448.58s -> 1451.70s]  rocket launchers that have different amounts of ammunition, different amounts of rockets
[1452.26s -> 1452.74s]  quantities.
[1455.85s -> 1456.49s]  Chat, I give it.
[1457.21s -> 1462.25s]  I give it like 10 seconds before we lose the round and have to reset.
[1462.25s -> 1463.29s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[1463.29s -> 1464.89s]  I got a bow and arrow.
[1464.89s -> 1466.49s]  We're already got an amazing shot.
[1467.37s -> 1468.01s]  We're fine.
[1469.77s -> 1470.97s]  Taking all the money, man.
[1470.97s -> 1471.93s]  You're not sharing at all.
[1474.25s -> 1475.21s]  Wait, does it split?
[1475.21s -> 1476.17s]  Does it split it?
[1476.17s -> 1477.93s]  Oh, sorry.
[1477.93s -> 1478.49s]  We'll talk later.
[1478.49s -> 1479.21s]  My chest hurts.
[1481.78s -> 1483.14s]  You take it all the fucking money.
[1483.14s -> 1483.86s]  I can't see.
[1483.86s -> 1486.18s]  I can't see through us because we're all snipers.
[1486.18s -> 1486.90s]  They've been pissed.
[1487.86s -> 1489.75s]  Why did I pick the classic?
[1489.75s -> 1491.83s]  This is like the worst item for man versus machine.
[1493.06s -> 1496.18s]  Not having a teleporter is awful, by the way.
[1496.18s -> 1499.16s]  Yeah, well, maybe you should have played engineer.
[1505.11s -> 1508.31s]  Oh, I definitely would not recommend bow and arrow for this mode.
[1508.31s -> 1508.87s]  Game mode.
[1508.87s -> 1509.35s]  Hell no.
[1512.26s -> 1513.54s]  Hey, they shoot back.
[1513.54s -> 1513.78s]  Yep.
[1514.50s -> 1515.70s]  They do shoot back.
[1515.70s -> 1516.34s]  Certainly can.
[1517.30s -> 1518.10s]  They do exist.
[1519.16s -> 1519.96s]  Somebody build.
[1520.76s -> 1523.96s]  Guys, they're getting real close to our base and whatnot.
[1524.68s -> 1526.63s]  It's okay.
[1526.63s -> 1530.71s]  I got arrows, a barrage of arrows and back in here.
[1530.95s -> 1531.67s]  Oh, they're behind us.
[1537.80s -> 1539.32s]  Oh, you ammo.
[1539.32s -> 1539.72s]  Ammo?
[1540.28s -> 1540.76s]  Yeah, we don't have any ammo.
[1540.76s -> 1541.56s]  Where's our engineer?
[1542.84s -> 1544.36s]  I think we're going to be all right.
[1544.36s -> 1545.80s]  I am shocked we've lived this long.
[1545.80s -> 1546.44s]  I'm going to be honest.
[1548.18s -> 1549.22s]  Oh, poke doing work.
[1549.86s -> 1550.42s]  I saw that.
[1553.05s -> 1555.21s]  By the way, if they get the bomb in, we lose.
[1555.21s -> 1556.17s]  What happens if you die?
[1556.17s -> 1557.05s]  Oh, that's what happens.
[1557.05s -> 1558.89s]  You come back, but yeah, it's a cool down.
[1558.89s -> 1560.49s]  Yeah, he's getting the bomb.
[1564.92s -> 1565.48s]  Oh, Lord.
[1568.30s -> 1570.62s]  Did we survive?
[1570.62s -> 1570.86s]  Yeah.
[1571.66s -> 1573.34s]  All right, let's let's wait with this.
[1573.34s -> 1574.46s]  $14 we're missing.
[1574.46s -> 1577.32s]  If we don't get all the money, we don't get a bonus.
[1577.32s -> 1577.56s]  All right.
[1577.56s -> 1579.48s]  Are we playing on like baby easy mode?
[1579.48s -> 1579.96s]  There's more.
[1579.96s -> 1580.76s]  There's more.
[1580.76s -> 1581.96s]  There's there's soldiers.
[1582.52s -> 1584.20s]  It's wave one out of seven.
[1584.84s -> 1588.04s]  Oh, boogers just flew out of that's going to be somebody's going to get a clip of that.
[1588.04s -> 1589.32s]  Boogers just flew out of my nose.
[1589.32s -> 1589.96s]  They're at the bomb.
[1589.96s -> 1590.68s]  They went down the left.
[1590.68s -> 1591.48s]  They went down the left.
[1591.48s -> 1592.12s]  They're at that thing.
[1592.12s -> 1592.84s]  We're losing wave.
[1592.84s -> 1593.24s]  I'm coming.
[1593.24s -> 1593.64s]  I'm coming.
[1593.64s -> 1594.04s]  I'm coming.
[1594.04s -> 1594.44s]  I'm coming.
[1594.44s -> 1594.84s]  I'm coming.
[1600.18s -> 1600.90s]  We're going to lose.
[1600.90s -> 1601.30s]  We lost.
[1601.30s -> 1601.54s]  We lost.
[1601.54s -> 1601.86s]  We lost.
[1601.86s -> 1602.02s]  Sorry.
[1602.58s -> 1602.98s]  No, we didn't.
[1602.98s -> 1603.22s]  We're good.
[1603.22s -> 1603.54s]  We're good.
[1604.18s -> 1604.74s]  No, we didn't.
[1605.62s -> 1606.58s]  Not yet, germ.
[1606.58s -> 1607.30s]  Not yet, buddy.
[1607.30s -> 1608.90s]  I'm shooting as many as I can.
[1610.68s -> 1611.24s]  Get the scout.
[1611.24s -> 1611.56s]  Get scout.
[1611.56s -> 1612.36s]  Get scout.
[1612.36s -> 1612.68s]  Okay.
[1613.88s -> 1614.68s]  Not yet, buddy.
[1615.78s -> 1619.46s]  We lost $14 and I am fucking mad about it.
[1620.10s -> 1621.06s]  Clutch or kick.
[1621.06s -> 1622.98s]  We're not going to get the achievement.
[1622.98s -> 1623.70s]  I know.
[1623.70s -> 1624.90s]  Oh, we need an explosive headshot.
[1624.90s -> 1625.46s]  That sounds good.
[1626.33s -> 1628.17s]  Yeah, 100% get that.
[1628.17s -> 1630.89s]  I need to be able to hit a headshot because I don't think it's happened once.
[1632.41s -> 1632.97s]  It is one.
[1633.53s -> 1635.80s]  How is that not a headshot?
[1637.05s -> 1637.69s]  Oh, I died.
[1638.65s -> 1639.05s]  Oh, no.
[1639.77s -> 1643.99s]  Bunch of heavies incoming.
[1644.81s -> 1645.37s]  Shoot them.
[1645.37s -> 1645.93s]  What the heck?
[1645.93s -> 1646.57s]  I'm shooting them.
[1648.46s -> 1650.62s]  I don't shoot fast enough is the problem.
[1650.62s -> 1651.38s]  That's right.
[1651.38s -> 1652.42s]  It has to be fully charged.
[1652.42s -> 1653.46s]  This is the worst weapon in the game.
[1653.46s -> 1654.98s]  How the hell did we survive?
[1656.18s -> 1657.70s]  Good job, everybody.
[1657.70s -> 1658.66s]  We did it.
[1658.66s -> 1659.22s]  You got an A on your first test.
[1659.22s -> 1660.74s]  Rage against the machine.
[1660.74s -> 1661.30s]  That's a good one.
[1661.30s -> 1661.86s]  Not bad.
[1661.86s -> 1663.24s]  I get it.
[1663.24s -> 1663.48s]  Now's the fun part.
[1663.48s -> 1665.32s]  Can you change classes midway through or no?
[1665.88s -> 1666.44s]  Yes, you can.
[1667.64s -> 1670.44s]  We want to like take this seriously now or are we good to just
[1670.44s -> 1672.50s]  snipe?
[1672.50s -> 1674.50s]  Um, I'm taking it pretty serious.
[1674.50s -> 1676.34s]  Are we taking it serious now?
[1676.34s -> 1679.43s]  Oh, I don't tell y'all I've been sweating.
[1679.43s -> 1681.77s]  Yeah, let's take it seriously.
[1681.77s -> 1684.97s]  If we're going to take it seriously, then we need somebody needs to be engineer.
[1686.09s -> 1687.13s]  I could be medic.
[1687.13s -> 1687.93s]  Medic works for me.
[1692.41s -> 1697.21s]  I really I'm not sure I'm good with a lot of classes anymore.
[1697.21s -> 1698.09s]  Make sure you refund.
[1698.09s -> 1699.61s]  Are we actually swapping now?
[1699.61s -> 1701.29s]  Yeah, refund before you swap, though.
[1701.29s -> 1703.46s]  Refund before you swap.
[1703.46s -> 1704.10s]  You get the money.
[1704.10s -> 1705.22s]  Vinny, stay sniper.
[1705.22s -> 1706.18s]  You're a good sniper.
[1707.45s -> 1709.61s]  If there's double sniper, I won't be a sniper.
[1709.61s -> 1712.49s]  Someone said someone said there you can charge a sniper.
[1712.49s -> 1712.97s]  What does that mean?
[1713.69s -> 1715.93s]  OK, so the more damage it does.
[1716.49s -> 1717.37s]  Really?
[1717.37s -> 1717.85s]  Yeah.
[1717.85s -> 1719.75s]  Like Widowmaker.
[1719.75s -> 1721.03s]  Just like Widowmaker.
[1721.03s -> 1721.53s]  Oh, OK.
[1722.15s -> 1722.87s]  Yeah.
[1722.87s -> 1725.59s]  I mean, I was a Widowmaker main, so it should be not.
[1725.59s -> 1726.63s]  Yeah, you played Overwatch.
[1726.63s -> 1729.99s]  Then, you know, every single thing that's in this game, you know, everything about this
[1729.99s -> 1730.55s]  game.
[1730.55s -> 1731.51s]  Oh, great.
[1731.51s -> 1734.10s]  All right, Chris Krieg.
[1734.10s -> 1735.46s]  I think Chris Krieg is probably the one.
[1740.94s -> 1743.70s]  Um, what do you prefer?
[1743.70s -> 1744.58s]  Sniper if you want.
[1744.58s -> 1745.78s]  I could swap off.
[1745.78s -> 1748.74s]  You know, I can do spy if you prefer some.
[1748.74s -> 1749.86s]  I'm good with Demoman.
[1750.50s -> 1753.46s]  OK, you guys, I mean, all jokes aside, just play whatever you want.
[1753.46s -> 1753.96s]  Yeah.
[1755.14s -> 1756.90s]  Rotate out as well.
[1756.90s -> 1757.78s]  The hell is going on?
[1757.78s -> 1758.82s]  Wait, what is that?
[1758.82s -> 1759.38s]  Who did that?
[1761.38s -> 1761.94s]  Is it weird?
[1761.94s -> 1762.50s]  OK, come on.
[1762.50s -> 1763.14s]  Was that was that real?
[1763.14s -> 1765.61s]  He switched off sniper.
[1765.61s -> 1766.49s]  Oh, yeah, elbow kick.
[1767.59s -> 1768.15s]  No, no, no.
[1768.15s -> 1769.43s]  I actually will get booted from the game.
[1769.43s -> 1769.91s]  Don't do that.
[1772.54s -> 1773.82s]  This will like ruin everything.
[1773.98s -> 1777.43s]  Well, then you should have done it.
[1778.47s -> 1779.19s]  Don't do that.
[1780.52s -> 1780.76s]  All right.
[1780.76s -> 1782.36s]  Who who wants the crits?
[1782.36s -> 1785.18s]  And if you want to know what the crits are, the me.
[1786.22s -> 1788.38s]  Go stock sniper with explosive headshots.
[1789.02s -> 1790.78s]  The seventh class in the game is the medic.
[1791.66s -> 1792.70s]  That's what I am doing.
[1792.70s -> 1793.66s]  Is that dumb?
[1793.66s -> 1794.22s]  No, that's good.
[1794.22s -> 1794.54s]  That's good.
[1794.54s -> 1795.42s]  That's what my chat saying.
[1795.42s -> 1795.98s]  That's a good thing.
[1799.51s -> 1799.75s]  All right.
[1799.75s -> 1800.47s]  I'm not doing it to you.
[1801.11s -> 1801.91s]  Oh, all right.
[1801.91s -> 1802.23s]  Vinny.
[1804.50s -> 1804.82s]  All right.
[1804.82s -> 1806.66s]  We're all on the roof on the roof.
[1806.66s -> 1807.70s]  I'm up here.
[1807.70s -> 1809.30s]  Yeah, look at Jerma stream.
[1809.30s -> 1810.58s]  He got the slick back here.
[1810.58s -> 1811.22s]  Looking like he's trying to.
[1811.22s -> 1813.22s]  I mean, are we a drip contest or no?
[1814.02s -> 1814.90s]  Oh, that's right.
[1814.90s -> 1816.18s]  Yeah, we'll do drip contest after this.
[1816.18s -> 1816.42s]  All right.
[1816.42s -> 1819.06s]  Tank is in this very where we're doing it right now.
[1819.86s -> 1821.22s]  Stock grenade launcher is better.
[1822.86s -> 1824.06s]  Use Scottish resistance.
[1824.06s -> 1825.82s]  Oh, man, I'm getting so many suggestions.
[1825.82s -> 1826.62s]  All right.
[1826.62s -> 1828.46s]  When you're ready, just unload on that thing.
[1828.46s -> 1829.26s]  I'm going to give you crits.
[1831.38s -> 1834.20s]  Now I missed all.
[1837.48s -> 1838.92s]  I forgot this even existed.
[1840.55s -> 1842.07s]  Guys, my gun is really loud.
[1842.07s -> 1842.55s]  I forgot.
[1843.96s -> 1844.68s]  Turn it down.
[1846.20s -> 1846.52s]  Ding.
[1847.40s -> 1848.86s]  I'm getting it.
[1849.50s -> 1851.35s]  Watch out.
[1851.35s -> 1852.63s]  By the way, there are spies now.
[1852.63s -> 1855.83s]  So if you see somebody that looks like you, it's not you.
[1855.83s -> 1857.59s]  If you see something, say something.
[1857.59s -> 1858.87s]  Is that not me?
[1858.87s -> 1859.35s]  That's not you.
[1859.35s -> 1860.39s]  I thought that was me.
[1860.39s -> 1861.91s]  Okay, I'm going to shoot the bomb.
[1861.91s -> 1863.51s]  You guys keep shooting the car.
[1863.51s -> 1864.23s]  Yeah, we're not.
[1864.23s -> 1867.11s]  It's priority is the car to be shot.
[1867.11s -> 1868.23s]  Drop this right here.
[1869.19s -> 1869.59s]  Not me.
[1870.31s -> 1873.59s]  Oh, by the way, if you need health, press E so I can see.
[1874.55s -> 1875.91s]  Oh, that is a lot of soldiers.
[1877.13s -> 1877.69s]  I got you.
[1877.69s -> 1879.59s]  They can't be headshot.
[1879.59s -> 1880.15s]  I'm in trouble.
[1881.35s -> 1882.47s]  I'll stay on the tank.
[1883.27s -> 1885.91s]  Me and poke should be able to get a tank if I do it.
[1886.95s -> 1888.71s]  All right, I'll try to take the soldiers with the century.
[1889.75s -> 1890.39s]  Where's the ammo?
[1890.39s -> 1891.77s]  Oh, it's down here.
[1892.81s -> 1893.53s]  There's a spice.
[1895.77s -> 1897.38s]  Yes, it's over.
[1898.34s -> 1900.68s]  It's to the right, basically the right pathway.
[1900.76s -> 1903.86s]  I'm not liking where this tank is at fellas.
[1903.86s -> 1904.84s]  Tank is almost there.
[1904.84s -> 1907.24s]  I will move my century towards it.
[1907.24s -> 1908.04s]  It's going to run me over.
[1908.68s -> 1909.96s]  Oh, yeah, it can run you over.
[1909.96s -> 1911.16s]  It actually can kill you instantly.
[1911.88s -> 1912.84s]  Guys, it's getting close.
[1912.84s -> 1913.32s]  It's mine.
[1913.32s -> 1913.80s]  It's mine.
[1913.80s -> 1917.05s]  It's the tank, guys, it's the tank, it's the tank.
[1917.05s -> 1917.61s]  It's in my century.
[1918.73s -> 1919.29s]  The tank.
[1920.17s -> 1920.73s]  It's got to get in.
[1920.73s -> 1921.37s]  It's got to get in.
[1921.37s -> 1927.56s]  All eyes on tank, all DPS, all DPS on tank, all DPS.
[1927.56s -> 1928.20s]  I'm trying.
[1928.20s -> 1928.76s]  I'm trying.
[1928.76s -> 1930.44s]  I can't do it fast enough, buddy.
[1930.44s -> 1931.40s]  I can't do it fast enough.
[1931.40s -> 1932.36s]  We actually might be able to do it.
[1932.36s -> 1932.84s]  We can do it.
[1932.84s -> 1933.40s]  We can do it.
[1933.40s -> 1933.96s]  We can do it.
[1934.44s -> 1936.60s]  We actually might be able to do it.
[1936.60s -> 1937.24s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[1937.24s -> 1938.28s]  Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
[1938.28s -> 1938.76s]  Oh, we're dead.
[1938.76s -> 1939.16s]  It's over.
[1939.96s -> 1941.24s]  No, no, we can do this.
[1941.24s -> 1943.88s]  Gang, we thought we saved it for a minute.
[1944.44s -> 1945.08s]  Okay, we're good.
[1945.08s -> 1946.52s]  All right, I gotta stop saying it's over.
[1948.55s -> 1949.43s]  I'm died.
[1949.43s -> 1951.27s]  I'm coming to come, we're good.
[1951.27s -> 1953.43s]  You can press H to respawn instantly.
[1953.43s -> 1956.14s]  It costs money, but I can revive you.
[1956.14s -> 1957.50s]  I can revive you if I get you.
[1957.50s -> 1958.86s]  No, I missed the shot.
[1958.86s -> 1960.70s]  Oh, sorry, it's okay.
[1961.42s -> 1962.78s]  All right, we needed more snipers.
[1962.78s -> 1963.58s]  I don't know.
[1963.58s -> 1965.10s]  Yeah, we needed more snipers.
[1965.10s -> 1967.10s]  It was way easier when we were all sniper
[1967.58s -> 1970.39s]  Who's restarting what's going on?
[1970.99s -> 1974.55s]  Wait, are we not returning? We are right? No, no, no, we know we're good
[1974.55s -> 1978.71s]  We just get essentially we just go back to where we were at the beginning of that round
[1979.63s -> 1983.39s]  It's not like oh we lost we got a rekey. Yeah, you get your money back and you get to try again
[1990.65s -> 1992.65s]  Just pick pyro
[1996.17s -> 2003.67s]  Special key I'm switching I'm not sniper dude. I'm a spy
[2003.69s -> 2007.17s]  I might go pyro should I just go flog pyro? Just say who cares?
[2007.17s -> 2012.41s]  I mean, I mean what pyro would wreck the tank Vinny. Do you have the log?
[2013.59s -> 2017.03s]  Let me check because I can always switch out of pyro. I don't have the flog
[2017.03s -> 2023.55s]  You want why don't you do pyro and I'll I'll do I'll continue with demo but with better weapon, okay
[2023.71s -> 2029.89s]  Yeah, I'll let me let me refund and I'll go what should I use for my upgrades as a spy?
[2031.93s -> 2039.57s]  Mm-hmm. So you're a Scottish resistance and pin the sapper is incredible in man vs machine because the sapper
[2039.73s -> 2043.51s]  Disables the robots when you have enough upgrades in it
[2043.55s -> 2047.15s]  You can do a huge AOE and turn they go
[2047.35s -> 2051.79s]  And they power down for like five to ten straight seconds a huge group of them. So it's really really good
[2052.15s -> 2055.07s]  Why'd you want me to put the pan on chat? It's just a power copy
[2056.03s -> 2060.71s]  Blood blood, you know, I'll backstab work in the game you stab in the back and they die instantly
[2060.91s -> 2064.35s]  Yeah, yeah, so if you can get behind him, then that will do a lot
[2064.35s -> 2069.37s]  I'll just increase my jump height and then I'll be able to jump over them. This is really fun
[2069.37s -> 2071.25s]  I actually like this a lot. I do have a big problem though
[2071.25s -> 2074.49s]  Unfortunately, I might not be able to play flog because I'm not high
[2079.93s -> 2081.93s]  I'll have to take a five-minute break
[2081.93s -> 2083.93s]  All damage
[2087.61s -> 2092.91s]  We lose this I'm out. Oh, we don't wait. How do I use sappers and cloaks?
[2093.27s -> 2098.63s]  Okay, so right click to cloak sapper. You have to pull it out and then you just left click to put it on a thing
[2099.60s -> 2104.71s]  Like any trick your sniper still has four to pull out the sapper or two
[2105.79s -> 2108.87s]  Yeah, this is I spy. I'm Pat. This is fun. I like this a lot
[2109.39s -> 2116.07s]  Did this require a coupon I'm a spy right now it requires it requires one $1 coupon there
[2116.43s -> 2121.79s]  Also, I was reminded queuing for us. There's a squad surplus where you'd like one ticket pays for everybody. Oh shit
[2121.79s -> 2126.71s]  We probably should have done wait. No squad surplus. All that does it just makes us we get more items in the end
[2126.71s -> 2134.33s]  Oh, nevermind. Yeah, everybody has to still buy it. I mean everyone ready at four. Oh, yeah. Sorry, but this time
[2134.75s -> 2137.19s]  I'm ready to rock and roll flog pyro. Oh
[2140.47s -> 2143.55s]  Passer this thing is amazing in members machine, by the way
[2144.31s -> 2150.40s]  This guy's been looking up the strats. No, I I've we've been talking about playing this like two months
[2151.24s -> 2154.12s]  Wait, really?
[2154.16s -> 2157.64s]  Prepared a little bit better. The knife does not work on the tank heads up
[2159.32s -> 2161.86s]  So you can shoot with your gun because there's no guys coming yet
[2163.32s -> 2165.70s]  Where's the I get a better headshot sound cuz my
[2166.22s -> 2168.72s]  I
[2169.04s -> 2176.18s]  Got one of me going spin. Oh, that's the one most. No, I'll get that to you. I'll send you that wave. Don't worry
[2176.18s -> 2177.38s]  I need a minute
[2177.38s -> 2180.52s]  I'm gonna get face down
[2180.52s -> 2185.45s]  Did you get spied by a spy as a spy? Yes, I did. I
[2186.21s -> 2194.16s]  Didn't know that was a thing. Oh, we're doing way better now with this composition. This is really way
[2194.20s -> 2196.20s]  You do
[2198.40s -> 2200.40s]  Yes proximity does matter
[2201.40s -> 2207.84s]  right
[2207.84s -> 2211.26s]  Going in for the kill the bombs going, right?
[2211.88s -> 2213.88s]  All right. I need help with the tank
[2214.04s -> 2216.46s]  Yeah, I bet you do
[2216.46s -> 2220.06s]  Yeah, I do. That's why I said it my century. I'll get it. You guys can go back to the robots
[2220.06s -> 2223.28s]  Oh, nice. Nice. Nice. That's right. Trying to I'm gonna get the
[2223.86s -> 2225.86s]  bomb carriers I
[2226.44s -> 2228.28s]  Died Oh
[2228.32s -> 2234.07s]  Alright bombs over here. Oh, there's a lot of money on the ground. We got to get this. Oh
[2236.79s -> 2238.79s]  They got me
[2238.79s -> 2241.99s]  I'm collecting money. I'm like money's I'm trying to I'm trying oh
[2244.94s -> 2251.79s]  We got lots of snipers and spies by spawn shit, I try to jump over it. Oh, never mind. They're dead
[2251.79s -> 2256.29s]  I think we're watch out for spies spies me spies me poke. Watch out turn on
[2256.89s -> 2258.54s]  That's a spy
[2258.54s -> 2268.59s]  Save the century how about it? We're gonna we're okay. We're doing fine. We're doing good. Not bad and chat
[2268.59s -> 2275.35s]  I have not played much man versus man. This is like man versus machine. What are we doing Ludwig? Do you know you can disguise?
[2276.35s -> 2286.49s]  You can so they don't shoot you when you're disguised. You don't have to be invisible. I love
[2287.01s -> 2290.29s]  They don't I don't I can't hit them when I'm disguised
[2291.45s -> 2295.98s]  Yeah, but they won't shoot you and you could just walk up to him and sap him. Hey, we're good
[2295.98s -> 2302.18s]  Oh, you sap you can sap on visible. Yeah. No, I'll disguise. That's what I meant. Wait. Yes
[2302.18s -> 2304.18s]  What's the difference between disguise and invisible?
[2304.34s -> 2309.62s]  Invisible is they can't no one can see but it's basically in man versus machine disguise is better than being invisible
[2313.55s -> 2323.04s]  You want some here you want coffee you want a sip which would be pressing for I think yeah, I think I'll
[2323.48s -> 2325.48s]  Get more penetration
[2325.72s -> 2334.59s]  It's what we're all trying to do in life, isn't it? That's right. All right. Now this thing is powered up gonna be awesome
[2335.03s -> 2345.57s]  All right. So we have if it's you see the red background that means that it is guaranteed crits every single shot
[2346.42s -> 2353.74s]  And it's the infinite symbol means that they have infinite ammo and they just BAM and there's a hundred and twenty-eight scouts
[2353.90s -> 2364.68s]  We're fucked just shoot them. Wait chat. Should I do all sticky upgrades? What do you guys think in here?
[2364.80s -> 2370.04s]  Sticky bomb is good for a demo for this mode sticky
[2370.82s -> 2376.97s]  It's been a long time, but you can have a ton of stickies out right if you are good for slow targets
[2376.97s -> 2380.70s]  Yeah, it just does so much damage versus tanks
[2380.70s -> 2386.08s]  If you have a tank is coming out and you get crits you get a crits canteen and you just put out an entire
[2386.40s -> 2390.93s]  Just magazine of learning know what it's called. Whatever people gonna make fun of me
[2391.97s -> 2394.65s]  You put you just do the whole clip out and you'll do
[2395.21s -> 2401.51s]  Thousands of damage to the tank. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna try that. I see what that's like find a button for a canteen
[2401.87s -> 2403.47s]  What is what does the canteen do?
[2403.47s -> 2410.71s]  So the canteen at the last tab in the shop allows you to buy personal little power-ups for yourself
[2410.79s -> 2415.19s]  One of them is invincibility, which is uber charge. So you become invincible for five seconds
[2415.39s -> 2420.79s]  The other one is crits, which is obviously you get it times three damage. Where is that? How much it is?
[2420.79s -> 2423.10s]  I don't know
[2425.98s -> 2427.98s]  Really doesn't care
[2428.22s -> 2433.26s]  Technical with it. I don't give a shit about it. Crikey fucking losers in my chat correcting me
[2433.66s -> 2448.00s]  You guys are doing a really good job here. I'm just waiting to come in
[2450.78s -> 2452.78s]  Get closer and then I'll detonate. Oh
[2453.42s -> 2457.66s]  What it's a germa ADHD special interest stream
[2460.18s -> 2462.18s]  Wasn't visible I thought I'd play that well
[2462.42s -> 2466.62s]  Like a hitbox like a lobbyist big paying me to do this. What does that even mean?
[2467.14s -> 2470.81s]  All right, we have a lot of money we need to get big TF2
[2472.88s -> 2480.08s]  They're they're moving on the left the bomb. I got it
[2480.64s -> 2486.52s]  No, not your my left. I got him. I got my left your left. I just took care. Are they dead?
[2486.56s -> 2489.40s]  Yeah, I took care of it. He's making a bomb down over here
[2490.04s -> 2493.14s]  Freaking out with my sentry here. I big soldier big soldier
[2493.88s -> 2504.66s]  Nice, I'm trying not to whip the stickies chat
[2505.26s -> 2508.26s]  which is a really specific and weird sentence, but
[2508.74s -> 2510.74s]  You get it
[2514.14s -> 2516.31s]  I just taunted
[2518.93s -> 2523.86s]  Whoa, oh centers down
[2527.63s -> 2530.30s]  What is
[2534.30s -> 2538.74s]  It was a very my thing is so loud my head shots elected. Oh, yeah
[2538.86s -> 2544.38s]  You're uh, guys you can change the hit songs the bomb is at the thing lower the bomb is that thing I'm whiffing chat
[2544.38s -> 2545.74s]  I'm whiffing
[2545.74s -> 2548.24s]  Okay, it's good. Oh shit bomb. Is that the thing?
[2549.16s -> 2551.16s]  I'll drop the center over there
[2556.12s -> 2564.40s]  Sorry, we're good. We're okay. We got we got further that time. I don't even want to see that from your point of view
[2564.40s -> 2566.40s]  I let him go by me. I
[2566.56s -> 2572.64s]  Gross I'm so sorry. I don't want to be around anymore. No, it's all right. We're doing fine. This is advanced
[2572.64s -> 2575.82s]  This is not this is hard. You guys are doing great
[2576.58s -> 2581.62s]  Yes, I'm switching. I'm not the spy anymore. Make sure you refund if you refund you get all the money back
[2581.70s -> 2584.14s]  Yeah, but make you have to do it before you switch classes
[2584.50s -> 2587.42s]  Then he did it before right? You did it after you'd be screwed her
[2587.42s -> 2592.36s]  I you might have to just go back and yeah, you just swap back and then you go to the thing and refund
[2593.20s -> 2595.20s]  I will be
[2595.60s -> 2600.89s]  Who's this dude, honestly soldier gun soldier heavy
[2601.41s -> 2607.52s]  I'm what I'm older. I mean, they just they just do so much pot. They have so much power. This guy seems cool
[2608.20s -> 2611.14s]  Demo, man. Oh, it's someone already demo man. Yeah, we have one
[2611.14s -> 2619.06s]  I'm gonna try the more than one demo. I can be we have that poke is that hey engineer soldier
[2619.58s -> 2621.38s]  You go you go heavy
[2621.38s -> 2627.15s]  Load, you might like it. You want less reload speed? Hey engineer. Come over here. I really should stay on medic
[2627.31s -> 2636.53s]  Where or a scout? No, this is where I should set up over here entry goes here. Okay, I'll do it
[2636.53s -> 2646.70s]  I learned my lesson a long time ago. Never believe ha ha ha ha. Oh, they're talking about channel points
[2646.70s -> 2653.35s]  I get it gotta move that gear up
[2659.52s -> 2665.94s]  Ideally at the corner wait like here. Yeah, so that you can hide behind the wall and still repair it
[2665.94s -> 2667.70s]  Oh, I thought I would get hit from here
[2667.70s -> 2669.54s]  But yeah, I guess you're right or at this corner
[2669.54s -> 2676.74s]  So you have to still have the dispenser in the ammo we could always just do six engineers and say who cares and just go
[2677.06s -> 2692.36s]  That'd be kind of fun. Do you know what I care ready up? Are we good to go? Yeah. Oh
[2693.94s -> 2703.52s]  Yeah, almost I'm putting on these things Chad. Do not question my sticky placement. It's great
[2703.98s -> 2709.21s]  So the question minigun, oh cool. I couldn't overwatch just do this
[2709.81s -> 2716.60s]  Well, they don't get an overwatch. Yeah, why couldn't they have Duncan do this in overwatch?
[2718.20s -> 2729.85s]  Duncan Idaho, I don't feel like I'm hitting them. Oh right when they land they're invincible for like a half a second
[2731.59s -> 2737.18s]  Damn, this pyro fronts doing really well
[2737.74s -> 2743.08s]  Yep, pick up that money. I'm trying to drop left
[2744.02s -> 2747.92s]  Big soldier got me
[2748.82s -> 2751.96s]  There you go big soldiers getting destroyed nice
[2752.60s -> 2754.60s]  Nice, that was way cleaner than last time
[2755.08s -> 2759.43s]  There's a lot of my century in an actual good spot is probably helping him
[2759.43s -> 2762.27s]  What do you while I'm not down there? Can one of you go grab that money work goes away?
[2762.75s -> 2768.80s]  Yeah, you don't get the money if you don't pick it up and it go it disappears the money for upgrading. I got it
[2769.60s -> 2781.92s]  Century buster, where's it at Jesus? Yeah, so a scout actually is the money collector
[2796.43s -> 2800.79s]  Gaming a bomb approaching on a scout hook. I got a great view of that, by the way
[2801.39s -> 2803.39s]  You saw that? Yeah
[2804.19s -> 2810.39s]  Yeah, I'm not gonna know the meta like I'm doing my best but like it's gonna take a while to learn meta
[2810.59s -> 2812.59s]  I'm just gonna listen to Jerma
[2815.55s -> 2821.87s]  Well, listen to me for don't I just got killed from behind by a sniper bitch killed me
[2823.91s -> 2827.49s]  All right
[2828.05s -> 2830.05s]  Where are you at big rounds?
[2830.09s -> 2836.83s]  It was a 30 kill round for me. Is that like not bad? That's pretty desperate damn good
[2837.31s -> 2842.75s]  I'm still going. Yeah, we go bomb is here. Guess. Don't get too cocky. Yeah, I
[2843.31s -> 2845.63s]  See how it works. No, if you see money grab it
[2847.11s -> 2850.63s]  Shit. Hey, why didn't overwatch do this? This is crazy. Listen
[2851.39s -> 2855.31s]  Isn't this like the most fun you've ever had in a video game? Like how come why didn't they just do this?
[2855.31s -> 2857.87s]  Oh, I have never been happier
[2858.67s -> 2861.51s]  Okay, I got some stickies by the bomb here snipers
[2863.51s -> 2865.95s]  Take on the tower defense games
[2868.07s -> 2874.45s]  Not one of you okay, I was gonna say overwatch has the
[2875.13s -> 2879.65s]  The workshop which allows you to adjust all the attack speed and everything like they could
[2880.29s -> 2882.65s]  Up in MBO. I hear where
[2885.05s -> 2890.41s]  Now they're gone, but yeah, we need to keep an eye on I'll be back here to keep an eye on the bomb
[2891.01s -> 2903.55s]  We're good. We're good. We're good one scout going right one scout. There's literally one scout
[2903.55s -> 2906.51s]  I'm not fast enough to get him. He's at the bottom right now. Nice and
[2915.57s -> 2920.00s]  That is a successful wave completed. Yeah
[2922.84s -> 2924.84s]  Our scout should be picking that up
[2925.00s -> 2928.78s]  Hey, it's a bit of a scout. Oh
[2929.74s -> 2936.54s]  All right chat. Let's see. What am I upgrading here now that I have all my damage up?
[2936.54s -> 2943.15s]  This is where I really shine as a vlog pyro find canteens. Okay, I will but
[2943.67s -> 2961.91s]  Wait, I lost upgrades of you switch guns. Oh
[2962.93s -> 2969.05s]  Yes, you because you all the upgrade is there's so many different weapons in the game it's individual to each item Oh
[2970.37s -> 2977.04s]  Burn damage sucks, dude. What really? What do you mean burn damage is useless here? Why I understand
[2979.27s -> 2988.39s]  Wait had the wrong one to mine. It's it's already H. Okay, like H Judd Benjamin. It's only after burn. Oh
[2989.11s -> 2992.27s]  Okay, I thought it was all right. That makes sense. Yep. Yep. That's true
[2995.48s -> 3005.48s]  Resistances in the character menu Oh fire and create and all that stuff. Okay, dude, this germans. This is your fourth tour. Is it nice?
[3007.21s -> 3018.07s]  Yeah, apparently you're a little bit of a pro health on kill is important. Yeah, so I need crit resistance for this wave
[3018.35s -> 3020.65s]  It's good to have anyways
[3023.57s -> 3030.29s]  For this wave no, but not for this particular wave eyes this wave don't get backstabbed. Yes. All right
[3030.29s -> 3036.73s]  I'm good. Put it into jump height. Why would you ever put it into jump height? What is that? What would that do?
[3037.78s -> 3041.54s]  Someone said Vinnie. I thought you were a pan lover zero upgrades sad face
[3044.52s -> 3046.90s]  People do some goofy shit in members machine. It's like oh, yeah
[3048.12s -> 3053.00s]  I'm gonna put on a like the fish and fully upgraded and then do jump height and movement speed
[3053.00s -> 3056.12s]  It's like okay. Well, we're gonna lose but you're gonna have a good time. Yeah, pretty much
[3056.64s -> 3061.67s]  Alright, where should I post up as a machine gun enthusiast?
[3061.99s -> 3067.47s]  So it's distance matter with me is good because then you're near the dispenser. Yeah, so you see
[3069.11s -> 3072.57s]  Up here. Oh where you guys are. Yes. Yeah. Yeah
[3072.57s -> 3078.43s]  Yeah, cuz I coming the box like the refrigerator next to me will heal you if you stand near it
[3078.99s -> 3091.32s]  I'll get this money in a second. I've made sure I took the most fall damage possible. That's good. Good job. Excellent
[3091.32s -> 3093.32s]  Mark, Jeremy, I'm really happy with your performance
[3093.92s -> 3105.36s]  Whoa, I see I should have stood closer to the refrigerator. We're good
[3105.88s -> 3112.20s]  Spies are here. If you think I can somebody it might be somebody else. Yeah, we need that money
[3112.92s -> 3115.88s]  I'm gonna get some of it. There's a lot still there
[3121.24s -> 3124.32s]  Vinnie you blew yourself
[3124.36s -> 3130.33s]  All right, and you're surprised by that watch out for the sentry buster coming up the stairs right now. Okay, how'd you bust her on the stairs?
[3133.89s -> 3138.98s]  I'm trying to kill it. Okay, we're good
[3141.24s -> 3144.08s]  Huge Scout big very big Scout
[3145.00s -> 3150.40s]  Wait, how far is no they made him that big is he dead? I don't do another
[3154.04s -> 3156.71s]  Such a buzzer on the stairs
[3156.71s -> 3159.79s]  Okay, that's fine. I gotta get this fucking money
[3160.47s -> 3162.48s]  They got snipers
[3162.48s -> 3171.64s]  To the streets. Let's go. Oh my god. He's going to get weak. He's going the bomb real fast. No
[3172.32s -> 3174.32s]  We got a problem on the left side
[3174.32s -> 3176.32s]  Oh
[3177.67s -> 3183.11s]  All right, we need that money we got oh we got the money we're good. Oh, we're good. All those were spies. Okay
[3183.11s -> 3186.07s]  I'm I took buster took out the spies. I'm not moving
[3187.20s -> 3193.86s]  What bunch people ran by me? You gotta move. I'm holding up the front you guys can keep the back alive
[3194.54s -> 3200.89s]  That's a lot of money sentry buster coming in. I don't know from where oh shit scouts a scout
[3202.13s -> 3206.81s]  You don't know where from where Jerma I don't I got distracted a scout was right here
[3206.81s -> 3209.05s]  I'm real. I'm real. I'm real same place. Oh god
[3209.69s -> 3211.69s]  If I wasn't looking
[3211.85s -> 3214.21s]  And they always go to the century
[3214.81s -> 3216.61s]  Just stop
[3216.61s -> 3219.13s]  Shining a microscope onto how stupid I am
[3222.67s -> 3224.67s]  Free to be honest that way
[3226.51s -> 3228.51s]  Alright
[3230.35s -> 3235.73s]  Where's our scout at I want to yell at them it could be me. I'm supposed to be getting the money
[3236.33s -> 3242.53s]  I got it. Yeah soldiers Opie. So do you guys think that owning a microscope is a really terrible idea?
[3242.53s -> 3243.97s]  I want to get in real life
[3243.97s -> 3249.45s]  Yeah in real life like buying a microscope and again, and I'll give you the thesis here. How much is the microscope?
[3249.45s -> 3256.77s]  I got a hundred bucks like guys. No idea. That's great. Yeah, like ten bucks. What doesn't matter like it's not about how much it costs
[3256.77s -> 3263.57s]  It's about what you would do when you had it and what I'm talking about here is I'm talking about I would get I would
[3263.57s -> 3268.69s]  Put a drop of water on that look at it from my sink or something and be like I'm never drinking water from here ever
[3268.69s -> 3272.90s]  Again, oh, yeah. Well, I just realize a microscope is different than a telescope
[3274.10s -> 3276.16s]  It's the opposite. Yeah
[3276.16s -> 3280.16s]  There's actually this thing that went around recently like an article about how New York City
[3280.60s -> 3285.33s]  Water fountains have like little shrimps in them. So like when you're drinking out of a water fountain
[3285.33s -> 3293.22s]  There's like microscopic shrimps in water and I live in New York City. I will never touch that again unless I need protein
[3293.26s -> 3298.59s]  I'm it's flavor right? You don't like free flavoring. It is free flavor. It's like drinking sea monkeys
[3300.17s -> 3305.99s]  Without having to pay though. It's free sea monkeys free sea monkeys
[3307.27s -> 3312.15s]  There you go this economy. You're gonna give that up. Yeah
[3313.33s -> 3320.10s]  The same roof it can be but it's a tank again. So we're gonna need to be forward
[3320.94s -> 3326.36s]  Copy you need big damage this round in position feeling good ready for a battle
[3327.00s -> 3329.00s]  We ready to battle
[3329.24s -> 3334.48s]  Want to be over here cuz they can heal off the refrigerator, but no, thank you, sir. All right
[3334.84s -> 3339.59s]  Be careful fall damage does hurt. Hey, whoa
[3340.15s -> 3345.51s]  Are you telling us cuz you've learned from experience or you just know about it?
[3345.51s -> 3351.19s]  I'm just telling you because I've taken 20% of my health off every round because I just keep jumping off of the roof
[3351.99s -> 3359.49s]  It's a disaster. I don't know if you know this sometimes you're close to push me off. Oh, here we go. Okay, I'm activating my crits
[3359.49s -> 3361.69s]  All right, let's go for it. We can melt this thing quick
[3362.49s -> 3368.46s]  Well, that wasn't quick crit canteen. Yeah
[3369.10s -> 3374.75s]  Okay, we are fucking all right stop on the way
[3375.47s -> 3378.54s]  that was perfect placement of
[3379.26s -> 3385.74s]  You know, I bet our heavies the medics can't move her. Yeah, I this is I can't
[3386.62s -> 3390.06s]  Scout I got it. I got it. I'm going to go. I got him. I'm going to going
[3390.58s -> 3396.14s]  All right. I got it. All I got it all. We're good. Watch me kill this heavy in fucking 10 seconds
[3396.62s -> 3400.99s]  Dude look at that. So good. You guys got the tank, right? Yep. Thank you. I got this guy tank
[3401.71s -> 3407.37s]  Tank down good shit. Good shit. Wow a little bit money left
[3408.13s -> 3414.82s]  Yeah, sentry buster coming up. Yep. Yep. Yep. Those things are so fucking loud. Oh
[3416.58s -> 3418.58s]  Where is he? Oh
[3429.94s -> 3431.94s]  Big heavy right around the corner. Oh
[3434.06s -> 3436.06s]  Doing a lot of
[3436.06s -> 3438.62s]  Shit. All right. He's over. He's over folks on the tank. I
[3439.14s -> 3448.53s]  Was trying to kill the medics break they could do it. Yeah focus the medics always because they will uber I
[3449.96s -> 3459.47s]  I accidentally made them uber. All right, we got to focus on the tank too. I'm gonna move that gear up
[3460.63s -> 3462.63s]  That's a good idea. I
[3462.83s -> 3464.47s]  Should get his tank
[3464.47s -> 3469.27s]  Or I will move that gear directly into a bunch pyro. Yeah tank is a tank should be fine. I think we're good
[3469.79s -> 3474.51s]  Where's the bottom graphic
[3475.03s -> 3481.75s]  Hi, that's a good point. What is the bottom graphic beam? I think the health of a certain the heavies walking the bomb back
[3482.55s -> 3487.71s]  He's been walking the bomb back. I focus on heavy. He's he's around the right tank is down. Oh
[3489.10s -> 3491.86s]  God, he's right there. Nice. That was good
[3493.14s -> 3498.68s]  We didn't collect a lot of money though that we're about to get it. We're about to see a big bump. Nice
[3499.80s -> 3501.80s]  huge bomb
[3501.80s -> 3508.84s]  I mean you give me a tank and I and I say how high
[3515.09s -> 3520.05s]  Does this run also have tanks it does and it also has permacrit soldiers
[3520.05s -> 3524.97s]  So this is the time to buy that crit resistance crit resistance purchased
[3524.97s -> 3528.41s]  Is this a blast resistant group a fire group?
[3528.57s -> 3536.02s]  This would be a blast resistant group as well as a bullet resistant group. Let me go. Let me do this
[3536.06s -> 3538.23s]  Let me do this. Ooh
[3538.51s -> 3541.30s]  There are no there are no tanks this round there are only
[3544.30s -> 3546.30s]  Myself a tank drama to be honest
[3546.78s -> 3550.18s]  That's like you got a notification. I think I find piss
[3552.75s -> 3556.52s]  This is the final round or penultimate. I
[3557.92s -> 3560.16s]  Think this is wave what wave?
[3560.88s -> 3568.63s]  Way the seven waves in this one. This feels penultimate, but my math has never been good. It's got a penultimate vibe to it
[3569.19s -> 3578.80s]  Let's get it. How we feel how we feel feel good. I'm feeling
[3579.80s -> 3588.21s]  Good yeah, I'm feeling good dog dog sentry turret. Can your turret shoot me dog dog dog? Oh god, damn it
[3588.21s -> 3592.05s]  I just haunted and I had to I was trying to rock paper scissors you and I just ruined everything
[3592.05s -> 3595.89s]  All right. I didn't mean like as a request more so concerned
[3596.77s -> 3598.77s]  But good to know that's a teaching moment
[3599.29s -> 3602.10s]  All right, I'm ready
[3606.03s -> 3613.75s]  All right, you know I missed don't ever say crank in that sticky launchers hog ever again chat member supposed to be me
[3615.03s -> 3618.23s]  Me doing that. Oh
[3618.63s -> 3624.20s]  Nice dog. I
[3624.64s -> 3626.64s]  Love engineer on my MVM stuff on
[3628.12s -> 3633.25s]  Trolling all right big a soldier a big one
[3636.02s -> 3638.02s]  Check this out. Yeah, I'll take
[3639.62s -> 3649.40s]  Ignore medic request money money money. I
[3650.76s -> 3655.30s]  Heavy moves fast the sniper got there. Who are those beans Wow
[3656.02s -> 3659.20s]  Hmm these beans right?
[3659.80s -> 3670.88s]  What's G do? What does G? Why would you tell me to press G? Oh, geez taunt?
[3672.60s -> 3674.60s]  My freaking gun for a half hour
[3675.36s -> 3678.36s]  All right. I got the money. Yeah
[3678.64s -> 3688.35s]  Let's get back into position. I'm starting to think that they're noobs. All right heavy's coming in Oh
[3694.40s -> 3696.64s]  Ridge gives you mini crits
[3696.68s -> 3700.08s]  Sniper on the on the side there. Yeah, we got a problem coming on the left side. Oh
[3700.12s -> 3702.04s]  Oh
[3702.04s -> 3711.37s]  Whoa medic went flying. Why is this guy invincible because the medics are ubering him
[3712.58s -> 3715.54s]  Yeah, there's always money. I'm target. I'm dead right now
[3716.74s -> 3728.68s]  He'll medic medic. I'm dead. Wait, so you're all that three hours earlier. I was right there. Okay, I'm going for this money round
[3729.44s -> 3731.44s]  Nice got such a buster
[3735.03s -> 3744.83s]  Fucking hell big heavy big heavy waste this other money that I didn't get coming in hot
[3746.67s -> 3748.97s]  century buster
[3749.17s -> 3752.05s]  Buster coming up. Oh
[3752.69s -> 3757.88s]  Shit, it's my pervert our huge huge
[3758.60s -> 3762.72s]  Soldier with medics. Oh, I'm gonna try to kill medics. Yeah left side soldier
[3764.24s -> 3766.24s]  They all over oh my god
[3768.76s -> 3770.52s]  Yeah, I got yeeted
[3770.52s -> 3779.73s]  Up until then it's going pretty good. We're doing it's going great. I think we're champions
[3782.46s -> 3784.46s]  Century buster and then that's it
[3784.70s -> 3786.04s]  Big heavy
[3786.04s -> 3792.64s]  All right, so you guys are coming up. Yep. I'm gonna lose this war
[3792.64s -> 3806.02s]  I think it's just this big heavy big heavy has the bomb and it's coming up like the left side said press Emma
[3809.26s -> 3813.02s]  Chat bomb is down. They said M for medic
[3814.62s -> 3819.31s]  It's a good guess oh
[3819.31s -> 3822.13s]  Come on. I got it. I got him. I got him. Good. All right, just the
[3823.05s -> 3828.10s]  Soldier and that's it. I think there's like a few dollars and hanging out somewhere. Yeah
[3830.81s -> 3835.45s]  There's 50 bucks, there we go 24 what I mean who even needs money anymore
[3836.17s -> 3843.22s]  Yeah, we I need the better you die here jump speed. So this is this is this is it? This is the big one
[3843.62s -> 3846.30s]  three tanks
[3846.90s -> 3848.30s]  Tanks, so just all right
[3848.30s -> 3851.46s]  So us just to let everybody know that hasn't not really played MVM
[3851.78s -> 3858.05s]  The scout is the money collector class and it's usually required somebody is almost required to do it
[3858.65s -> 3861.45s]  You get healed when you pick the money up as a scout
[3861.53s -> 3867.38s]  He also has like a big radius around him that picks it up for free, but we're at the last round
[3867.38s -> 3869.38s]  I don't we're doing just fine
[3869.66s -> 3874.66s]  What should I get as an upgrade for the last round any any resistances like crit resistance?
[3874.66s -> 3881.80s]  Maybe there's one big crit soldier. The rest are all just big
[3882.04s -> 3894.36s]  I think our biggest problem is gonna be the tanks. I agree. This is a lot of last and bullet damage
[3894.44s -> 3903.90s]  I'm just gonna go resistance. I'm just gonna just max myself out. Are you having a smashing good time?
[3903.90s -> 3907.99s]  I am actually I'm actually
[3909.11s -> 3913.49s]  Usually aren't so let me get a play a seven days a die. I
[3914.76s -> 3921.01s]  Played oh, I played a lot of that one should do this question. They got a huge update question
[3921.41s -> 3924.17s]  What should I avoid here? Should I like avoid?
[3925.05s -> 3928.09s]  Penetration or should I get some resistances?
[3929.44s -> 3931.44s]  Resistance is a big deal now
[3931.92s -> 3939.22s]  Because these are all pretty much everything we're fighting is big. So they'll kill you in two seconds
[3939.38s -> 3946.10s]  You can never go wrong with move speed and jump speed move speed. Oh, yes, we're actually insanely important
[3946.10s -> 3957.76s]  I don't have any of it though. Are there crits in this one? There is one
[3958.40s -> 3963.79s]  Giant crit soldier. So yeah, we should be able to get rid of it pretty quickly though
[3964.27s -> 3966.31s]  Okay
[3966.31s -> 3968.81s]  What about fire resistance?
[3968.85s -> 3971.09s]  no pyros, so fire is
[3971.93s -> 3973.93s]  not necessary
[3974.29s -> 3981.18s]  The only thing that we have is bullet and blast and crit use crits before shooting stickies got it
[3981.18s -> 3983.34s]  Thanks chat also to after we do this
[3983.34s -> 3988.70s]  Everyone's gonna the reason why you use that that for duty ticket is because we're all gonna get an item after this and it could

[4060.28s -> 4064.86s]  I didn't I need it to get me right on somebody should probably hang back in the kind of area
[4065.36s -> 4068.84s]  Do you what do you think as a demo? Should I hang back or yeah, I need it against the tank
[4069.24s -> 4073.20s]  Cover that thing with stickies your bitch bomb for the bomb. All right
[4074.66s -> 4078.26s]  Big heavy on the right side. He's like pretty low though. He should be dead
[4082.06s -> 4084.06s]  Why'd you walk in a straight line at the heavy
[4084.78s -> 4092.56s]  Yeah, that's a big gun heavy dead heavy dead giant charge shoulder walking over three three three homies
[4092.56s -> 4095.57s]  Oh boy
[4096.33s -> 4098.33s]  Out of that tank
[4100.25s -> 4106.34s]  Did you forget what I was playing oh, I don't know I thought I guess it just takes over your brain
[4107.18s -> 4115.74s]  Don't kill me, please
[4115.74s -> 4119.88s]  Good. Oh
[4119.88s -> 4124.92s]  Now the tank coming up. No, I reckon I can melt this. I don't know what to do chat
[4124.92s -> 4126.92s]  I'm confused. Oh shit. Oh god, I
[4127.40s -> 4129.71s]  Get you up. I don't know how to
[4129.71s -> 4133.96s]  Scout's going left side
[4133.96s -> 4138.85s]  All right. Yeah, I have a single scout makes it past. We're in trouble
[4139.57s -> 4143.17s]  All right, it's okay. One's okay now on it speaking which nice
[4143.77s -> 4145.77s]  Actually help. Oh, please don't kill me
[4146.13s -> 4148.13s]  Nice. Okay, we're okay. I
[4148.37s -> 4152.46s]  Was the back right now?
[4152.54s -> 4156.26s]  I'm keeping an eye on the on the back with bombs right now. I can't help with the tank though
[4157.02s -> 4161.50s]  I got a century, but there's like four scouts going on the point. Let's shoot
[4163.38s -> 4167.30s]  Century back here should come to the point. I belong on this character. It's just cuz the shoes alone
[4167.82s -> 4174.63s]  As a reminder, you can press H when you die to respawn instantly. Oh
[4175.43s -> 4178.35s]  Yeah for this round that sounds like a good idea. Oh, yeah, there's no
[4179.19s -> 4182.91s]  Okay, tank tank is coming. We gotta kill that tank like now
[4183.55s -> 4186.05s]  What happened? There's a hole by the way heads up
[4186.89s -> 4190.29s]  There sure is there yeah, there is a hole that's right. I
[4191.09s -> 4193.09s]  Completely forgot about the one health
[4193.25s -> 4194.81s]  soldier on the right
[4194.81s -> 4198.46s]  He's gonna stick on the tank with
[4199.18s -> 4201.22s]  All right. What's down? I'm down. I'm down
[4201.22s -> 4206.78s]  I'm gonna respond immediately, but we got a problem with that bomb. That bomb is scaring me. I'll get the bomb
[4206.78s -> 4208.78s]  I got the bomb. Don't worry about the bomb focus on
[4210.66s -> 4214.70s]  Tank is down. Thank you. Thank is down. Okay down soldier on the coming up the other side. Excellent work
[4215.54s -> 4218.86s]  Loony tunes right there by crit canteens. We can't hear in there
[4219.62s -> 4232.40s]  Good. Okay. Okay. We got a second here where we can kind of relax. Yeah, we
[4233.72s -> 4235.72s]  Snipers got this we got this. Oh
[4243.07s -> 4253.49s]  Watch it with a sniper scout. Nice. All right, huge soldier coming in with a bunch of scouts. He's very hurt
[4254.09s -> 4261.83s]  What side right or left? Uh, they come in the right butts. Oh, right. Yeah, it's weird
[4262.83s -> 4273.69s]  Teleporter that's not good. Whoa, what happened? What fuck what happened? Just one get through
[4277.57s -> 4284.90s]  It's the moment chat you could it was like a continue or vote restart no, we're good. Okay continue continue
[4284.90s -> 4288.10s]  Yeah, just go restart resets from round one. Oh, okay
[4288.66s -> 4294.30s]  Cat you saw that could upgrade your character. You heard the trigger. Wait, how do you upgrade a character?
[4294.86s -> 4298.74s]  Wait, click your character icon you get movement speed and stuff. Yeah
[4300.54s -> 4302.91s]  Bullet resides a very important
[4304.91s -> 4308.56s]  Is there a lot of blasts in this one
[4311.16s -> 4313.16s]  This is very heavy on
[4314.00s -> 4317.32s]  blast a lot of
[4317.96s -> 4323.41s]  Infinite soldiers a big crit soldier, although there are a lot of bullet scouts
[4323.41s -> 4328.08s]  So we would that we did fine that time. I think we were good
[4329.48s -> 4331.68s]  I think once the bomb gets that close
[4331.68s -> 4335.76s]  I'll just leave the level three back there and then and then you guys hold forward
[4335.76s -> 4341.32s]  Yep, I had that alert was on screen for like a second and then I yeah, it was just too much too
[4341.32s -> 4342.80s]  It was too close
[4342.80s -> 4353.52s]  Then you would have won if you use the frying pan. I get drunk back rage. That's the one
[4354.04s -> 4362.35s]  Um knock back is really good. It's it's actually insanely powerful especially versus century busters
[4362.95s -> 4365.51s]  Because you can just hold the
[4365.55s -> 4367.99s]  Just track them and they'll fly across the map
[4368.59s -> 4371.75s]  And that's very helpful for me because then I don't have to move my century around
[4371.75s -> 4377.47s]  I know a lot of people right now are gonna say hey, don't listen to Jerma. That's a terrible strategy, but hey
[4378.11s -> 4385.23s]  They instantly said knock back halves your damage. He's so dumb. Don't get it. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Yeah
[4386.11s -> 4391.31s]  They're really upset at you. Why are robots attacking the Old West ghost town? Are we in it?
[4391.59s -> 4396.99s]  We're in it, we're in it to win it let's go I want to hear at least some enthusiasm from us. Okay, buddy. Yeah
[4397.91s -> 4402.49s]  Enthusiasm on three one. Oh, yeah, two three. Yeah
[4406.54s -> 4410.89s]  It's going all the way again
[4412.73s -> 4420.70s]  You're gonna go the distance is going for speed I am so hurt right now I was too busy doing a stupid fucking voice. Oh
[4421.50s -> 4424.72s]  What oh, oh boy, okay. All right
[4428.45s -> 4433.92s]  Oh God, I did not want to drop down. Oh
[4434.44s -> 4440.92s]  Okay, left ubers left heavies ubered. I don't even know what to do about that right now chat. Oh, that was my fault
[4440.92s -> 4442.92s]  I was supposed to kill the medics. That's my fault
[4443.24s -> 4447.22s]  All right, what have he's done? We just need left one. This is a huge pyro. Oh god
[4448.00s -> 4449.76s]  Sorry, no over
[4449.76s -> 4452.58s]  Someone keeps making them pop uber
[4453.06s -> 4467.20s]  Back to a back to square one. Oh shit. Okay. There come the tanks
[4472.02s -> 4475.92s]  I'm just getting bullied. Oh
[4477.31s -> 4479.15s]  I have a lot of
[4479.15s -> 4483.22s]  I'm gonna go focus on the soldier is pretty low, but I'm gonna focus on the tank in the money
[4486.49s -> 4490.77s]  Century buster is right here careful careful. I can focus tank
[4491.41s -> 4499.32s]  Give us all crits. I think bunch of people coming up. Oh, what?
[4504.24s -> 4508.00s]  We're good, I can I can handle the scout guy this time
[4508.64s -> 4514.02s]  I'm ready. I can slow him. I can knock him back at the start to I should do that
[4514.02s -> 4519.59s]  I can also just leave my level three at the spawn for the start. That might just be the best
[4520.63s -> 4523.72s]  Yeah, this is a lot of scouts. It's just a ton of yeah
[4524.28s -> 4526.68s]  It's that beginning segment is a nightmare. I
[4526.68s -> 4539.04s]  Doubters are winning. Yeah, we'll get it. Are they? Okay. Are the initial scouts running down the left or right path switch, right?
[4539.04s -> 4543.23s]  Um for faster damage in a pinch use your grenades. My grenades are weak
[4543.79s -> 4547.91s]  If they haven't been upgraded by this point, they're not as good as this. Yeah
[4548.23s -> 4553.00s]  So what's that firing speed is glitched. You say you can't do a pass one. Is that true? Is this fake news?
[4553.00s -> 4560.23s]  I don't know that might be fair. Is that real? Mm-hmm chat. Is that real true? It's true
[4560.23s -> 4566.60s]  It's actually true only the second only the second tier is glitched
[4566.60s -> 4575.14s]  So if you do three, it'll fix it. Here's three and beyond are fine apparently, so you'd have to do with two points in it
[4577.97s -> 4589.62s]  What's the sticky it's 14 stickies at a time, I mean we could try all sniper here if it doesn't work
[4589.62s -> 4593.88s]  Well, yeah, that'll that'll definitely work. Yeah, we will find a way to beat this
[4593.88s -> 4599.37s]  I could also go scout or medic and we're totally fine. I mean, I don't know
[4599.37s -> 4604.73s]  I could also go scout or medic and we're totally fine. Everything we did was good
[4604.73s -> 4609.01s]  Let's ready up and we'll just kill the scouts. Amen. Amen. I agree
[4609.09s -> 4614.29s]  Why do you want is your Torian Lord hair and that person for at least a month? Oh
[4620.70s -> 4627.62s]  Shucks frankly, you almost had it the first time we just yeah, we were really close like we could have done that
[4627.62s -> 4633.76s]  That was that rage Luke. I think right-click. It's this whatever the special
[4634.48s -> 4640.00s]  Right better middle mouse, it's possible that it's not bound you might have to find it
[4642.52s -> 4653.49s]  Let's do it, let's do it. All right. All right. This one's for real. I miss every hit
[4654.19s -> 4665.22s]  Okay, I wish I had put my sentry closer
[4669.97s -> 4672.45s]  Great start great killer smart better
[4673.17s -> 4677.37s]  Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him. No shoot him. I got the thing on the medic
[4677.89s -> 4684.73s]  That's what I was supposed to do last time and I failed miserably that's that's sniper job because I could just kill all
[4685.37s -> 4689.21s]  The medics with one shot. Oh money doesn't matter anymore, by the way. So well, it does
[4691.29s -> 4695.11s]  What this guy just destroyed capitalism with one comment
[4698.75s -> 4704.62s]  Kind of quiet I went around this side and see if I can oh shit
[4705.50s -> 4708.30s]  Up is a sniper. Where'd they even come from?
[4710.37s -> 4713.72s]  Snuck in
[4713.72s -> 4715.56s]  sniper down the road
[4715.56s -> 4729.66s]  Thank him in he dodged. All right, two tanks back to back here. I'm gonna just focus on the scouts
[4729.66s -> 4744.32s]  I think I got them all nice good shit on the real well done. That was fast. Wow guys
[4745.50s -> 4751.48s]  Wow, the character progression was really inside you the whole time or someone activated their hacks
[4752.16s -> 4756.06s]  All right, don't get cocky
[4756.26s -> 4762.16s]  I'm raging this guy. I back him up all the way
[4762.88s -> 4775.24s]  Okay
[4775.24s -> 4786.48s]  Sniper on the left and soldier coming in that soldier. I can't see I don't even know. Yeah, I can't see shit too
[4786.48s -> 4788.12s]  smoky too smoky
[4788.12s -> 4790.44s]  Nice use that. All right
[4790.44s -> 4792.76s]  Oscar
[4792.76s -> 4797.19s]  Yeah. Oh nice. We're killing him
[4800.13s -> 4802.13s]  On the way up. Oh, we killed the
[4802.77s -> 4804.69s]  Oh, that was awesome
[4804.69s -> 4807.49s]  Well played. I mean we have him so stun lucked
[4808.21s -> 4815.43s]  Yeah, this is going way way better I don't know why
[4816.55s -> 4820.39s]  That's sticky debt. That's sticky death
[4821.03s -> 4832.96s]  Gonna eat this. He's taunting. Hmm. Yeah, the weapon I have when I build a meter I taunt and I get a hundred percent crit
[4833.60s -> 4836.43s]  Hell, yeah
[4836.43s -> 4840.27s]  There's a great weapon, but don't let don't tell anybody I said that though
[4840.59s -> 4845.98s]  It is the single most hated weapon in this game, which one?
[4848.70s -> 4850.26s]  Yeah, I don't have that one
[4850.26s -> 4857.92s]  Are there medics on though? Oh, I have a lot of scouts a lot of scouts sentry buster as well
[4858.44s -> 4861.59s]  Wait, is he alive though? Oh, he's lost
[4862.23s -> 4867.67s]  Nice rocket jump out of there
[4867.79s -> 4869.25s]  Thank you
[4869.25s -> 4884.15s]  Fuck. Oh scout. Yeah scouts fast. Shoot him. Yeah scouts, but it's hard to detonate these sticky back so soon
[4884.43s -> 4886.43s]  No, we're good. Now. We're good now was
[4886.99s -> 4890.14s]  It's weird. This is this is the this is it here. I
[4890.70s -> 4900.77s]  Gotta say guys
[4900.77s -> 4903.89s]  Great work. It's just an amazing time to be a gamer
[4906.01s -> 4908.85s]  With all the great games we have in the year 2023
[4910.37s -> 4912.37s]  F2 a library
[4912.73s -> 4914.73s]  All right, one more thing. We're good
[4915.25s -> 4920.63s]  We might get scouts that might be trickling out to be careful. This is it
[4921.31s -> 4923.19s]  Is the sentry buster alive?
[4923.19s -> 4928.90s]  Nope, my rage does not work against this tank

[4956.05s -> 4957.49s]  $100,000 item

[5011.04s -> 5013.04s]  Rare but worthless
[5013.52s -> 5019.26s]  Jay, I just was Jay and it's so loud like hemorrhoids. What?
[5019.98s -> 5029.16s]  All right. Thanks for playing man vs. Machine man up for more. See you guys next week. Okay, so

[5058.80s -> 5065.06s]  I enjoyed soldier before I can really determine what I want to do. I think I'm gonna have to open a crate to determine
[5065.06s -> 5066.38s]  What that is
[5066.38s -> 5072.88s]  Yeah, I just opened a handful. Let's see. How does how how does this how does this affect?
[5073.64s -> 5079.92s]  Society, how do you get a crate? This is a affected society greatly over the years
[5079.92s -> 5086.52s]  There's many studies have been done on it. They drop but you can go to the steam community market comm and buy like in bulk
[5086.52s -> 5088.52s]  Which will actually do this
[5089.60s -> 5096.09s]  Yeah, don't don't do it. Don't do it on stream. Whatever you do. I don't need to buy this. I'm buying two keys chat

[5153.74s -> 5160.77s]  No, no. No, it's not wasted. I actually really wanted this. I'm serious. I want I got a cow mangler stranger fire
[5160.77s -> 5164.73s]  I'm playing with it. I'm bleeding so hard. I'm doing cow mangler cargo constructor
[5164.73s -> 5170.57s]  Oh a cow mangler can't hurt buildings in the robots and they're technically buildings. Are they wrong? Wait, it doesn't work
[5170.93s -> 5179.22s]  Somebody just told me the spy from TF2 is French. Is that true? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, we we
[5181.46s -> 5191.23s]  Frenchman and he goes I murdered your toys as well. Don't is that your French Jerma? That's my spy
[5192.29s -> 5195.31s]  French give me your French. Yeah, give me something to say
[5197.02s -> 5201.22s]  And have it make sure it's not like oh you poop poop with his pants. That's what he's gonna
[5201.22s -> 5204.90s]  Yeah, I would like to for you to say in a French accent
[5205.95s -> 5215.05s]  Is is this really it? Is this all you have on the menu? How do I say that with a French accent?
[5215.05s -> 5217.89s]  Oh, I thought you wanted me to say it in French. Oh
[5218.25s -> 5220.25s]  Is
[5226.11s -> 5230.79s]  This it is this all you have on the menu is this all of you have on your menu
[5235.03s -> 5237.03s]  Phenomenal this all you have on your menu
[5239.58s -> 5242.14s]  His use are insane
[5243.10s -> 5251.21s]  So what is this explosive explosive headshots? What sniper rifle is good for this game mode any wrecks?
[5252.79s -> 5261.35s]  I was at the default the hitman hit maker. So apparently is good. What do you think jarate as well?
[5261.35s -> 5268.02s]  Maybe throw some bizarre bargain would be really good. I do have that
[5268.66s -> 5274.62s]  Heatmaker would be pretty good bizarre bargain. I know my chance answering you heat maker. Yeah, everyone's spamming it and just
[5275.74s -> 5278.58s]  I'll do hit me hitman. I can you want me to go heavy?
[5278.58s -> 5281.22s]  I can go back I can go back to my old ways cuz I can go
[5281.66s -> 5284.30s]  Medic instead of engineer this round and then actually heal people
[5284.82s -> 5288.65s]  but we probably want a heavy or
[5289.49s -> 5296.95s]  Soldier y'all need to carry. I got it. You know, it's not you can't also go engineer super fun. Is it the same map?
[5298.52s -> 5303.04s]  Nope, this is different. Whoa, this is much shorter. This map is a is very short
[5303.04s -> 5316.98s]  So this one is this one could be hard two soldiers bad any crits in this round. No, we could do two soldiers cool
[5317.50s -> 5319.42s]  crits
[5319.42s -> 5325.08s]  Wave one we should be. Alright, I don't think we need to buy too much. The cheaters lament is like the rarest items in the game
[5328.90s -> 5332.68s]  Why do I even have the cheaters lament, what does that mean?
[5333.20s -> 5342.97s]  You see what I think it means. You have a back then. No, it's just old. It's an exploit item
[5343.78s -> 5349.88s]  Everyone has that. Alright. Well, thanks for making me feel special chat. Everybody. Everybody has that dude
[5353.59s -> 5356.18s]  All right, so they
[5356.18s -> 5360.60s]  This one is kind of annoying right because they can actually go up top up here
[5360.60s -> 5373.87s]  All right, they can go through these now me standing here. They can't sure who's our engineer. We do not have one
[5374.53s -> 5379.38s]  So that could be that's not good too alarming could disable issue
[5380.02s -> 5387.46s]  One sec, we do have a scout and we do have a medic. So I think we'd be alright
[5387.46s -> 5397.58s]  I'm gonna purchase a crits Krieg because apparently I threw mine out. Give me just a sec. I love this thing
[5397.58s -> 5401.58s]  I don't know. Everybody hates when I play with this and you go. I do this weapon fucking sucks
[5401.58s -> 5405.82s]  Like take it off. I'm just like no which one cow made that
[5411.72s -> 5413.40s]  This is punch heavies
[5413.40s -> 5424.74s]  What is man up mode? That means we use the ticket to play the game sick. Okay. All right, poke
[5424.74s -> 5430.33s]  Let's do this double soldier. All right, no NG. Ooh
[5430.89s -> 5432.29s]  big balls
[5432.29s -> 5445.70s]  Like that AC DC song big balls. Yeah, who's this guy flying around the map?
[5446.26s -> 5453.17s]  Somebody's flying. Yeah, one of us
[5453.77s -> 5456.32s]  Who's scouting? Oh
[5456.32s -> 5464.15s]  The scout. Yep. I'm gonna have a money you guys like money. I heard get off this character though
[5466.40s -> 5474.59s]  Anytime you hear the whoo, that means you're gonna get healed every time you heard something. He's going through big Scout. Oh
[5477.69s -> 5479.69s]  Oh
[5481.25s -> 5483.25s]  Come on come on in right here
[5487.97s -> 5489.97s]  Because so old
[5491.29s -> 5494.85s]  Okay, I'm gonna switch off a soldier here, but I that was fast
[5495.49s -> 5499.65s]  What's wrong? Is that impressive chat? Oh
[5501.53s -> 5510.22s]  Shit, that was bad. No, let me try sniper one more time. Who's gonna engineer cuz I don't know how I'm too stupid
[5510.26s -> 5518.54s]  I could I could go NG. All right, this is better. I could do NG if you poke if you wanna play something else
[5518.54s -> 5520.54s]  I'll play in you
[5520.74s -> 5524.96s]  NG oh I can do
[5527.48s -> 5536.47s]  Okay, hey take a look at my wrench everybody this one is just but you know what it's possible I get from this game mode
[5542.11s -> 5545.71s]  Yeah, take a look at my wrench was a disturbing sentence I didn't think that's what you meant oh
[5546.79s -> 5550.95s]  The Sydney sleeper also increases piss cooldown, I understand
[5551.47s -> 5563.60s]  Yeah, we need more piss right now. I want the frontier justice. I'm ready. I am almost ready and headshot though
[5564.40s -> 5568.08s]  Ready to deliver justice. All right, I have crits Creek
[5568.08s -> 5571.12s]  Which means I'll give you 10 seconds of crips where you will just annihilate everything
[5571.12s -> 5574.56s]  So I'll give you the heads up when you do that, but then yeah, can we get a code word?
[5575.20s -> 5578.00s]  I mean, I would have thought the word crits, but maybe
[5578.52s -> 5585.24s]  Bagels was a safe place the old teleporter in here probably right? It was the word bagel plus bagel. Yes bagel
[5585.24s -> 5588.88s]  Okay. All right, if I hear that I know to shoot I will not shoot until then
[5589.56s -> 5592.02s]  Scream as loud as you can when you need it. It's the only way
[5593.78s -> 5595.78s]  Unless you do it Spencer's going right here
[5596.50s -> 5600.98s]  Which is protected enough from the enemies, but oh, why is my health booming?
[5602.19s -> 5605.03s]  Medic medic does overheal gives you a little whoa
[5605.99s -> 5609.35s]  Pretty sick. Why is he going away?
[5610.61s -> 5612.25s]  Unless I'm healing you
[5612.25s -> 5614.25s]  Ludwig, I don't need upgrades
[5615.53s -> 5616.69s]  $100

[5624.38s -> 5626.38s]  $100
[5629.06s -> 5633.58s]  I'm the tf2 player here. It's bullshit. Yeah, if your chat was playing maybe
[5639.87s -> 5641.87s]  It was funny on my screen
[5642.03s -> 5651.74s]  We have a battle siren, there's somebody else's microwave going off. Oh
[5654.47s -> 5658.42s]  God, I gotta go get my hot pockets. Can we pause?
[5663.98s -> 5665.98s]  God this isn't going so great

[5675.92s -> 5677.68s]  Why did I go that far?
[5677.68s -> 5680.03s]  Damn

[5718.03s -> 5720.78s]  No
[5720.78s -> 5722.90s]  Wow, that was useless of me
[5723.50s -> 5729.06s]  They were like getting stuck on this defense, sir. How do you accidentally press G? Was it a good thing? Cuz H is close
[5729.90s -> 5731.66s]  Scout

[5783.06s -> 5788.38s]  R with rifle to use your charge buff on the sniper. Oh, right, right. Okay teleporter
[5788.38s -> 5790.82s]  We'll take you both ways now if you want to go back

[5830.87s -> 5832.51s]  those medics
[5832.51s -> 5837.39s]  Only shoot those medics because they will just keep this heavy ubered for a full two to three minutes
[5837.39s -> 5841.15s]  If you headshot the heavy and you have the explosive headshots, you'll usually get the medics

[5988.26s -> 5993.09s]  That sounds awesome. All right, they're gonna be going pretty much both directions. So it doesn't matter
[6003.33s -> 6008.16s]  Someone said what the fuck is wrong with his fov
[6008.66s -> 6016.81s]  It's wrong with my fov. You want I can't see your screen if you want to change your fov you can do so

[6022.65s -> 6029.17s]  Usually people when they say your fov for some reason they forget what fov actually isn't they're talking about your view model
[6029.61s -> 6035.97s]  Go. Oh, yeah, if you might have the weapons real small if you want if you're gonna change your view model in like the console
[6035.97s -> 6037.97s]  Just make sure you do that off-camera

[6051.92s -> 6053.92s]  I see you in great distress Doug
[6054.32s -> 6062.90s]  Just a little scared. I have a tank phobia. Can we destroy this tank right now for real? No cap

[6100.45s -> 6103.85s]  Over healed more than I should be able to I think you do. Yeah, okay. Oh
[6109.00s -> 6112.22s]  Shit oh
[6112.22s -> 6121.73s]  Man, that was awesome. This is an arrow through my fucking head. Oh, yeah

[6160.94s -> 6165.35s]  Dude I'm so sorry. We have become such a a
[6166.03s -> 6172.84s]  Synchronized unit that we're gonna beat this in like 20 minutes. Are we capable of doing the real ones?
[6175.30s -> 6177.10s]  This is not a real one
[6177.10s -> 6180.74s]  This feels real to me. I don't know the harder difficulty. That's much harder. There is
[6181.42s -> 6183.42s]  What is this difficulty called?
[6185.13s -> 6186.65s]  Bagel pussy
[6186.65s -> 6191.53s]  There's an advanced and there's expert. I'd like guys for introducing that word into this game
[6194.83s -> 6196.83s]  That being said I am going to pop it right now
[6197.63s -> 6210.94s]  Big dem on the right. I got big guy. Nice. Very good. I'm just gonna throw piss at the tank
[6210.94s -> 6224.46s]  I don't think it worked. I don't I don't think I'm the most qualified to handle this tank
[6224.54s -> 6231.08s]  As a sniper also the dispenser I upgraded Spencer. So there's a big trail on it. Yeah, I've not I've never not had ammo
[6231.14s -> 6237.74s]  Yeah, I think this might also be one of the easier maps because half the enemies like have melee right tank. What do you got?
[6238.70s -> 6246.77s]  All right, let's decide for handle it. Let's sniper handle. Let's leave
[6247.53s -> 6250.61s]  The tank can't even carry the bomb. What's the risk of letting it through?
[6251.33s -> 6254.13s]  It is a bomb is a bomb. It is a giant
[6255.55s -> 6259.84s]  A plus credit rate. Look at that
[6260.84s -> 6262.84s]  Wow
[6263.32s -> 6271.54s]  Ready for hard mode. Yeah, to be honest. It's a bit of light work true. They don't know how hard hard is. Oh
[6273.99s -> 6275.99s]  The real game starts now

[6314.33s -> 6317.25s]  I wanted to go see a doctor for that one. So he says it's just laughing
[6317.25s -> 6324.09s]  I left once and you had wait you had to see a doctor after laughing. Yeah, I don't know what it was
[6327.44s -> 6333.70s]  I mean, it's involuntary. So seeing a doctor was probably the right move. Mm-hmm

[6514.45s -> 6520.98s]  Another wave another dollar I was thinking about we should probably just redo the whole thing. So we start the stream. Hey everybody. Welcome
[6523.26s -> 6525.26s]  Start all of our streams
[6537.20s -> 6541.72s]  What is that accent a damn germ the heaviest Russian

[6594.64s -> 6598.98s]  Damn gives a bubble or the good water. So I can't like a server
[6599.50s -> 6603.72s]  That was very good, but I don't know who water is. You don't know what?
[6607.72s -> 6613.32s]  Character just liked it. I just liked it. What is water look like to you based on that voice like if you had to guess
[6614.32s -> 6621.04s]  One eye is purple because he's got hit in the face and he's very he's got like a mustache and a lot of a
[6621.56s -> 6625.96s]  Like a five o'clock shadow. Yeah, and he's someone in my check. Can you draw that?
[6628.95s -> 6639.06s]  Peru dude, so cringe. That's him. He's got it. Did I I don't think that was even close. Wait?

[6651.08s -> 6655.28s]  Wait chat. Does he have a mustache? No, I don't think so
[6655.96s -> 6658.36s]  It doesn't look like Danny DeVito and Matilda. I
[6659.88s -> 6668.32s]  Think that's what stir described. Yes, sir. I think you saw Danny DeVito in Matilda and that's why you recently, right?
[6670.24s -> 6671.52s]  Yesterday
[6671.52s -> 6681.69s]  Just can't get Matilda out of the brain. She's just like me. Did you know Danny DeVito directed that movie?
[6682.53s -> 6685.77s]  No, really very talented guy the director produced
[6686.37s -> 6689.65s]  I'm pretty sure he directed that. Yeah, that was a directorial movie for him
[6690.29s -> 6692.52s]  He's done a lot of
[6692.52s -> 6694.28s]  Stuff that you wouldn't think
[6694.28s -> 6700.23s]  We are absolutely destroying this. Oh
[6702.51s -> 6705.13s]  I'm gonna hit you
[6706.05s -> 6710.77s]  I thought you're about to die. There you go. I'm feeling great. I'm feeling electric. I
[6711.41s -> 6717.40s]  Mean, we got to go to hard mode. This is a little too free for dollars somewhere
[6717.96s -> 6719.00s]  spies
[6719.00s -> 6721.32s]  spies are
[6721.32s -> 6732.10s]  Here nice. Oh a spike on me. Nice. This one spot spy is quite nice poke
[6735.44s -> 6744.97s]  I'm not here careful. Imagine playing a spy a grown-ass man. Well, I use the focus the wrong time
[6746.47s -> 6752.03s]  Grown-ass person playing a game. It's so funny because that's probably like the hardest most meticulous class to play
[6752.87s -> 6756.63s]  You need like a certain level of adult intelligence, I think to be able to do it
[6759.79s -> 6762.11s]  I've been saying as much as I can lately
[6764.31s -> 6766.55s]  Imagine a grown-ass man doing that a
[6770.68s -> 6772.68s]  little bit of a
[6774.40s -> 6776.40s]  Heavies are going around the left side
[6776.48s -> 6780.14s]  Yeah, I seen him. We have the bomb though. Yes seen it
[6780.82s -> 6783.15s]  old news
[6783.15s -> 6791.59s]  Right. They keep saying here comes the spies. I haven't seen him. So someone's doing a great job on our team
[6791.59s -> 6793.59s]  Oh shit! There's a bunch of heavies going behind
[6793.59s -> 6795.59s]  In the middle. Is this a spy?
[6795.75s -> 6798.51s]  Holy shit, how many people? Oh, there's a lot back here
[6799.27s -> 6801.95s]  This person evil. I can crit you if we need
[6803.75s -> 6805.75s]  Are we alright?
[6805.91s -> 6815.09s]  Money somewhere money money money. Where's the money on this side? I got it. I got some money here. Oh god
[6818.61s -> 6825.73s]  Yeah, oh yeah, all right, this is it this is the hard one who's missing the nine
[6826.73s -> 6828.21s]  Wow
[6828.21s -> 6829.57s]  stir, I
[6829.57s -> 6836.01s]  Mean if you're the engineer standing on the roof shooting its guys in a totally random spot
[6836.01s -> 6839.65s]  You don't say that money dropped over there. I don't know to go get it. It's fair home
[6840.25s -> 6842.97s]  Imagine being a grown-ass man saying something like that
[6845.49s -> 6849.84s]  Talk about money
[6849.84s -> 6856.72s]  I gotta do this. I gotta do this. All right, a lot of blast a lot of blast like what the blast
[6857.44s -> 6859.36s]  Any crits any critters?
[6859.36s -> 6870.96s]  Yes, any fire? No fire. Three tanks final wave. I think that's what I'm doing
[6870.96s -> 6875.97s]  I think we're pretty much ready to rock and roll. Mm-hmm
[6876.57s -> 6881.63s]  Grown-ass team ready to bagel puss. Grown-ass men talking about bagel pussies still
[6884.63s -> 6886.63s]  Grown-ass men
[6886.83s -> 6889.19s]  Some grown-ass men playing TF2. What's going on?
[6889.79s -> 6892.47s]  Uh, this is what grown-ass men are meant to do
[6894.19s -> 6896.19s]  Well, I can't afford
[6900.42s -> 6907.46s]  Easy grease
[6908.30s -> 6914.94s]  It's gonna be like three tanks back to back to back a lot of medics just make sure we know that okay
[6915.38s -> 6919.23s]  I'm ready. I don't know about the rest of the people on the team
[6919.79s -> 6927.13s]  That press f4 when they're ready, I'm ready those feelings also already at this point, I believe remember you're not blinking
[6927.13s -> 6929.90s]  What I was last time I blinked you guys
[6930.54s -> 6932.46s]  Actually calculate that
[6932.46s -> 6937.96s]  Yeah, they have like they have like a notebook. You're right down
[6938.56s -> 6941.63s]  bling watchers, man
[6941.87s -> 6950.84s]  Why did you just scroll fall damage? I just heard you scream Doug. All right, lad. You ready?
[6951.40s -> 6954.16s]  Yeah, it's always this air coots guy
[6954.86s -> 6961.32s]  Okay time to clutch your kick
[6961.52s -> 6963.95s]  You imagine a grown-ass coots
[6965.05s -> 6967.05s]  Don't don't don't be come on
[6968.58s -> 6974.89s]  There's this is DPS that we didn't get on the tank. There's one second. We lose if we lose this was why?
[6975.45s -> 6990.66s]  Hey, all right

[7008.34s -> 7014.43s]  If he is a spy that spy is not one of us that one of us is me that me is a sniper
[7014.43s -> 7016.43s]  That's sniper is a pyro
[7016.67s -> 7020.30s]  you talk like the guy in Disneyland on the
[7021.02s -> 7024.02s]  Indiana ride I
[7024.26s -> 7028.03s]  I do. Yeah, he gives you like the safety instructions

[7134.29s -> 7136.29s]  They got a laugh. That's what a laugh is. Oh
[7136.77s -> 7138.77s]  Yeah, if you don't know what how it goes it goes
[7144.53s -> 7151.81s]  Sentry buster. Oh, I'm the engineer. Oh shit pushing it back pushing it back. Oh

[7228.82s -> 7231.78s]  Take time and then we're done. That's it. Yeah, I
[7232.46s -> 7234.46s]  Was free. I'm not gonna lie
[7234.82s -> 7239.10s]  Shields kind of good. Yeah, Doug's kind of crazy as medic
[7239.74s -> 7250.10s]  Jonas buff. Oh
[7250.22s -> 7252.38s]  Sniper we got some snipers on the map, too. Oh
[7252.94s -> 7254.94s]  You got him. You got him
[7255.42s -> 7260.09s]  Crazy
[7260.21s -> 7264.13s]  Mental all right, man. We got somebody get something cool. They're nuts
[7264.65s -> 7266.65s]  All right, big old sword
[7267.13s -> 7273.49s]  Banana nice. Oh, yeah here. What we get. Come on. No whammies for me. No whammies for me. Give me a jacket. Oh
[7275.18s -> 7280.78s]  Yeah, nice that's my favorite weapon in the game, I don't think I got anything is that normal you didn't get anything got a
[7281.50s -> 7283.50s]  thruster oh
[7283.50s -> 7284.86s]  Yeah
[7284.86s -> 7289.26s]  Because you do you have to complete the tour and you've already done this apparently I guess. Oh
[7292.05s -> 7294.05s]  That me too. I didn't get anything either
[7294.57s -> 7299.03s]  shit
[7299.87s -> 7301.87s]  Yeah, and my result screen is bugged
[7301.87s -> 7305.99s]  Let's try like the hardest mode 36 year old man. Yeah, give us the hardest mode
[7305.99s -> 7310.11s]  Yeah, come on like it was a lot easier because we didn't lose $400 around
[7310.79s -> 7313.75s]  But still they made fun of me for losing $6
[7314.07s -> 7316.07s]  Almost
[7316.07s -> 7322.23s]  Eight-year-old man by the way people in chat. You don't even know how yeah, that's it's me me and Jerma. Oh 38
[7323.11s -> 7329.47s]  And we can send this comp at the hardest one. They have this cop is not losing too many
[7329.47s -> 7335.74s]  I think if any I think we got what it takes to do the expert you want to oh boy
[7335.74s -> 7339.56s]  Oh, this guy thinks he can handle expert all of a sudden
[7340.40s -> 7345.84s]  Okay, all right, I just want to make sure everyone in the call understands. I'm trying to talk up the call
[7345.84s -> 7354.20s]  He's saying that he's talking about how none of you can do it. I can do it. Oh Botswana
[7354.20s -> 7359.69s]  Hey, I mean, I'm here to I could do I could do it. I could try it
[7360.33s -> 7366.49s]  Operation gear grinder warning expert missions are much harder in all caps. This is written in the game
[7367.05s -> 7370.53s]  Advanced missions require all six team members to be strong contributors
[7370.61s -> 7376.54s]  So the fourth class is the demo man and the demo man has two primaries
[7376.54s -> 7382.34s]  He's got the rocket the grenade launcher, and he's got the sticky launcher. This sounds like a mode for some grown-ass men
[7382.66s -> 7390.47s]  Yeah, cute up for man up. We are grown-ass man up, bro. You look like don't Chocula ban that person for a fucking hour
[7391.11s -> 7392.73s]  Huh?
[7392.73s -> 7396.68s]  Actually, no actually don't ban that person. That's fucking cool. I'm into that
[7396.68s -> 7411.08s]  She is not playing dark and darker now. They can do update came out. Do you have to crash for me?
[7411.08s -> 7418.84s]  Oh, no, never mind. It didn't sometimes the loading screen looks like a crash if you were tabbed. Yeah, I was tabbed
[7418.84s -> 7425.36s]  I'm playing geoguessr. I we forget you've never played tf2 and you don't know how like buggy the game is
[7425.88s -> 7427.80s]  Old the code is
[7427.80s -> 7435.51s]  All right. So what what are our strengths take your pick? I'm a nasty little tank
[7435.51s -> 7441.03s]  I'm a dirty little tank. I can I can scout well, I can stay Scout
[7442.31s -> 7445.17s]  Yeah, I'm fine going mad again. It was fun
[7445.17s -> 7453.39s]  I kind of want to do walk and load demo that suck now or I could spy
[7453.67s -> 7458.98s]  I'll do sniper again. If you guys think it's a my chats like I should do so
[7458.98s -> 7462.86s]  I think our last team comp was efficient effective and fierce
[7463.30s -> 7466.75s]  That's my thoughts and then they end
[7467.51s -> 7482.66s]  Yeah, doing something a little goofy, but let's give it a try. Yeah, let's let's let's give it a shot, bro
[7482.66s -> 7487.04s]  You are throwing right now. You don't know that okay, you know
[7491.31s -> 7506.29s]  Turn off on scoping after shooting in the options might feel better. You believe they're accusing me of being high right now
[7508.78s -> 7521.04s]  Take excuse me. Yeah, excuse you any crits this round not this round. Maybe I just do
[7521.64s -> 7537.20s]  Chat, that's not what I need. I don't I seems kind of use that way. Can I use the cow thing now?
[7537.52s -> 7545.44s]  Go golfing the cow mangler. Yep. It's honest
[7545.96s -> 7549.32s]  So that that does not have any ammo you just have to recharge it
[7549.32s -> 7553.08s]  It does take a little bit extra takes a little bit extra time to read. Oh, but it doesn't work of my guy
[7553.56s -> 7559.90s]  Yeah, so that that would only be on the soldier. Oh, yeah, I'm not soldier turn on damage numbers
[7559.98s -> 7567.90s]  Do you guys have your damage numbers on or no? I see it. Yeah. Wait, how you see damage?
[7567.90s -> 7572.68s]  It's in the every time I shoot it goes and it shows me every little number a classic TF2 videos
[7573.02s -> 7577.37s]  We should uber charged
[7579.06s -> 7585.34s]  Hybrid night in MVM with an Omega L face. Well, you haven't seen it play out. Oh, this is a bad map
[7585.34s -> 7591.70s]  We should have done the other map. This is actually gonna be really fucking hard. It's gonna be hard
[7591.70s -> 7596.94s]  I want to pick a map that we already knew and there's only three missions on the hard one because they made this cool mode
[7596.94s -> 7602.72s]  And then they never supported it after that ever again. What I thought valve did that a lot
[7602.96s -> 7609.96s]  There was MVM came out then like two years went by and then they added up like omissions in one update
[7610.22s -> 7615.98s]  But there's a whole bunch of community maps for this that are pretty cool. And we all love it
[7617.65s -> 7623.65s]  Some road add some roguelike elements to it and boom, there you go. Yeah, they could just call it TF 2 2
[7626.33s -> 7629.05s]  CF charge money for it all over again live
[7629.57s -> 7637.01s]  Mm-hmm TF 2 2 would be good if 2 3. Oh
[7639.04s -> 7645.07s]  Wow, oh, whoa. Whoa, dude. I got a DM from uh, I
[7645.71s -> 7649.47s]  Got a DM from Cody Ko and he said I did the Billy Billy challenge
[7649.53s -> 7653.37s]  which I thought meant the NPC challenge because the streaming said Billy Billy and
[7654.01s -> 7657.77s]  And then he said I threw up at the end so he was trying to say the dug dug challenge
[7657.77s -> 7659.77s]  But he called it the Billy Billy challenge. Oh
[7661.41s -> 7664.29s]  That's your challenge
[7665.09s -> 7670.56s]  It's my challenge in the sense that I did it first I guess I didn't created it
[7671.26s -> 7674.78s]  Poking it. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's your challenge
[7674.78s -> 7679.54s]  It's your challenge in the sense that you created it did it first and popularize it and made the rules
[7680.30s -> 7682.38s]  You don't have much ownership. Gotcha
[7682.90s -> 7687.73s]  Yeah, I wanted to do it and I wanted to hire like three or four
[7688.57s -> 7690.41s]  massive bodybuilders
[7690.41s -> 7693.60s]  And just go do it and pretend like already spies
[7694.68s -> 7697.44s]  Already spies. Oh, yeah, they're not messing around

[7719.45s -> 7727.82s]  Look at the top and if you see the spy icon there, that means they're still spies. Oh, we don't a teleporter
[7729.84s -> 7733.36s]  So we do we always $1
[7734.20s -> 7740.59s]  No, we it only gets consumed when you lose like no no when you win. Sorry. Oh
[7742.91s -> 7747.88s]  Here we go. Finally, okay long enough. All right, go go go. Oh, that's
[7748.88s -> 7755.97s]  Shit
[7756.13s -> 7758.69s]  The heel guys we got to kill the heel guys class work
[7760.91s -> 7773.13s]  The hell is that working drama? These guys take extra melee damage. I forgot to say that because they have those. Oh
[7776.84s -> 7778.88s]  That was me. I was me

[7791.04s -> 7793.60s]  Snipers focusing on us across the way. Oh
[7794.24s -> 7802.49s]  This is nasty. This is nasty. I got crits when we need guys getting healed. We got to kill the healer
[7803.25s -> 7811.18s]  Trying to push the bomb back. All right, we're okay. Yeah, we just back seven and kill it one shot or no
[7811.70s -> 7815.92s]  Can you can you watch all the back step?
[7816.92s -> 7820.51s]  This is just wipe it
[7820.95s -> 7824.51s]  No some things you can one-shot some things like the big giant ones
[7824.51s -> 7827.19s]  I don't think you can they just do a lot of damage to them. Geez
[7828.43s -> 7831.15s]  I'm having a hard time on spy. All right
[7832.39s -> 7840.07s]  Nothing, but I got disoriented shit. Wait, you know
[7840.75s -> 7842.75s]  That's coming in. Oh, yeah, that's here
[7843.43s -> 7845.43s]  now it's here at

[7888.87s -> 7901.01s]  I wonder if I should put on this thing use Huntsman with lead arrows
[7903.31s -> 7920.12s]  All right, I can do this. Should I not be sniper? Should I be like another class to help? What are you feeling?
[7920.12s -> 7923.90s]  I don't know. What should I light them on fire?
[7926.84s -> 7932.34s]  You should just turn around. I row is every now and then I feel a little bit
[7936.42s -> 7941.75s]  Just turn that song on and every time it says turn around turn around
[7946.11s -> 7953.32s]  No, would you go to a concert if they did that and they just kept getting higher and higher for an hour
[7954.98s -> 7960.02s]  Like a shepherd's tone. It just keeps going who's playing up until the point. It's a dog whistle
[7962.74s -> 7964.74s]  Well, then that's a problem
[7965.10s -> 7968.50s]  Yeah this generation of like how cool we are
[7969.02s -> 7973.78s]  Maybe you just go you film that song on your phone like as a selfie and then you leave after it's over
[7974.38s -> 7980.52s]  Now that's the whole concert they don't do anything else they do the one. Oh, that's it
[7980.52s -> 7985.24s]  Oh, then you're good. You get four hours of that. They come on and they're like we understand that
[7985.76s -> 7991.28s]  This is the only thing anybody ever sings of our anything we ever have ever done. So we're just gonna do this
[7991.84s -> 7997.78s]  And then they get really mad. They're like, how many of you fucking assholes even know a single other lyric?

[8811.02s -> 8813.02s]  Left heavy left heavy focus
[8813.14s -> 8817.10s]  Heavy versus heavy. It's too much respawn time
[8817.86s -> 8823.42s]  This heavy needs to be killed. I think we're all right. You might die. I try to get like half behind the staircase
[8825.18s -> 8827.22s]  I died. It killed me. Oh, oh, thank God
[8827.82s -> 8830.24s]  Good job guys, and I need you now
[8834.18s -> 8838.14s]  That was tough, I think knockback rage is decent easy
[8838.50s -> 8855.71s]  Maybe I do this and then this no shit. Do I really even need metal?
[8855.71s -> 8859.43s]  Yeah, I do, but I need defense
[8859.95s -> 8868.03s]  For tanks you guys the heavy is usually the best at shooting at wall crits. Just throwing it out there
[8868.03s -> 8873.15s]  I don't want to be that guy. Look I do shoot it and then my chat my chat just my chat roasts me
[8873.15s -> 8876.75s]  Okay, so I'm just sitting here my chat goes you your guns literally resisted again
[8876.75s -> 8882.45s]  So you shouldn't be using that so like I'll tell endure if you what you're asking for me
[8882.45s -> 8887.86s]  Just to endure this this this punishment of being made fun of for using a gun. That's not very effective

[8896.83s -> 8899.43s]  I'm gonna go up. You just got to use goon tactics
[8899.63s -> 8904.86s]  I'm doing literally while live and they just go heavy does reduce damage to tanks. Why are you shooting at us?
[8904.86s -> 8910.74s]  It's ridiculous here like reduce damage is still more damage than it would be if you didn't shoot it
[8910.74s -> 8919.30s]  Yeah, we need all the damage we can get which I crit somebody else then when we're attacking tanks
[8920.46s -> 8922.27s]  I
[8922.27s -> 8928.48s]  Think you still crit the goat. I mean you were shotgunning it for a full like minute or so
[8929.46s -> 8933.38s]  Shotguns without crit do like a quick thousand. They're pretty good

[9200.16s -> 9202.77s]  Yeah, there's a little side
[9203.85s -> 9206.41s]  Yeah, I'm noticing and I feel like you're losing
[9208.89s -> 9212.86s]  Do you know you can just raid people while streaming as many times as you want
[9214.14s -> 9220.94s]  No, yeah, you can just straight away. Why do they go? Where do they go? All right? Where do you it's like two Christmases?

[9229.58s -> 9233.52s]  It'll put them in the chat, but then you're still live so then some come back, and then you can rate again
[9233.70s -> 9238.02s]  Right, just lose all your viewers, but it's funny. Who am I rating? Who am I reading right now?

[9270.79s -> 9279.20s]  Who wants to have like a shitload of viewers?
[9279.20s -> 9285.22s]  I mean listen I say I'm nervous about it, but I wouldn't like downright refuse it
[9285.22s -> 9287.64s]  Well, you'd have to send him back to somebody else though in the call

[9557.18s -> 9564.50s]  Don't understand. Okay, so we're gonna put we're gonna collaborate all of our viewers into one stream and then that stream
[9564.50s -> 9568.74s]  We'll just pass it to the next stream and we'll continue this forever. So we all have a hundred thousand viewers
[9568.74s -> 9570.74s]  We're gonna like break all of our
[9571.98s -> 9575.88s]  Records, I'm gonna materialize viewers. Yeah
[9577.98s -> 9584.97s]  It's just vine sauce, yeah, and then who's after me stir I think stir should be after everybody get in the car
[9584.97s -> 9590.82s]  You're going to Uncle Vinesauce house. All right, everybody go to go to Vinesauce. I'm raiding. This is very interesting
[9590.82s -> 9594.70s]  Let's see how I'm also doing it. Yeah, but your stream is still on you don't you know

[9637.34s -> 9638.78s]  Six out of seven
[9638.78s -> 9644.38s]  What we could do is we just keep passing the viewers along up until the round actually starts and that person just has to deal
[9644.38s -> 9650.98s]  With them during the actual game. Or how about just at some point after like a minute or two just pass it
[9651.46s -> 9655.78s]  During the game. I'll just pass it in like a minute. I hit a new record. You just got me to 25k

[10522.53s -> 10528.61s]  Yeah, we need crits, but they we didn't we are not worried about being attacked by crits
[10529.21s -> 10540.41s]  Let me just open my chat back up because I haven't seen it in like 20 minutes. I'm feeling very prepared for this one
[10540.89s -> 10547.98s]  I'm thinking it's a dub. Is this final round? Yeah, it's final round right wave seven to seven. I think this is it
[10547.98s -> 10551.61s]  Yeah, this is the big one
[10552.77s -> 10554.77s]  Maybe I should buy crit for me
[10555.73s -> 10556.73s]  I
[10556.73s -> 10560.77s]  Made it ammo. I'm am I was like what I always run out of crit canteens
[10560.77s -> 10564.13s]  And it's like a halfway through the mission you died by crit canteens again
[10564.87s -> 10570.57s]  Okay, if you're like have money and you're in spawn and I'll be where the fuck is my entrance. Oh, there it is
[10571.58s -> 10576.10s]  Someone came into my chat and just said how come ten minutes earlier. I saw Vinny at 31 K
[10576.50s -> 10582.98s]  Like they don't understand what happened. We've confused the chat gaslight him say it never happened
[10583.98s -> 10585.98s]  I mean
[10586.46s -> 10590.46s]  Okay, I'm gonna put my dispenser over behind this fence over here
[10591.58s -> 10596.36s]  somewhere raid stir
[10597.84s -> 10604.59s]  Yeah chat, I would always have 31 K if I didn't do the diaper chief it
[10605.19s -> 10607.19s]  Wait diapers. So I'll say diapers
[10607.95s -> 10611.47s]  Diaper chief in particular. It's a bit that my chat really really likes
[10612.11s -> 10615.55s]  What is it? Well?
[10616.07s -> 10619.21s]  There's a not ready
[10619.53s -> 10621.85s]  Seconds you guys ready in Metal Gear Solid
[10622.77s -> 10625.51s]  hmm
[10625.51s -> 10627.51s]  Do you know the DARPA chief in Metal Gear Solid?
[10628.27s -> 10630.27s]  What sure?
[10630.67s -> 10638.69s]  It it's the diaper chief. Anyway, let's kill that tank. Okay, I like it. You know what that deserves a rate. I mean, that's a good
[10639.61s -> 10641.61s]  Yeah, thanks, man
[10642.13s -> 10646.77s]  If you guys like diaper jokes and welcome over the diaper grown-ass man talking about diaper. Yeah
[10647.05s -> 10649.05s]  That's man
[10649.13s -> 10656.09s]  Diaper sauce Oh grown-ass man sauce. Hey, I wish I didn't say that about diapers. Can't talk about diapers
[10657.09s -> 10664.56s]  There are not many diaper streamers on twitch. So, you know, it's a niche that you got to fill like a diaper itself
[10665.20s -> 10669.08s]  Maybe not many like do you think there are some? Oh, yeah. Yeah
[10669.48s -> 10672.72s]  There's a few right? Yeah, it's a limited amount but
[10674.24s -> 10676.24s]  Someone's got a film we have ubered
[10680.00s -> 10681.20s]  Far
[10681.20s -> 10687.83s]  Way, we're good, right? He's dead. Yeah, he's dead giving us a boost tank time
[10688.63s -> 10692.10s]  medics
[10692.10s -> 10696.12s]  like I
[10696.12s -> 10698.12s]  Got a tank you guys won't focus other thing
[10700.82s -> 10705.24s]  I'll create you now just to work on the tank. Oh, hey, man. Thanks for the raid
[10705.92s -> 10710.32s]  But it's weird that you'd raid me and we're all still playing together. I usually like in stream
[10711.16s -> 10716.00s]  Yeah, I think I'm gonna wrap it up here, okay, that's so fucking funny
[10719.10s -> 10723.98s]  Ending send our viewers to Ludwig like just tell them to go there. No, it's not possible
[10724.86s -> 10730.42s]  Well, we can just tell everybody to go twitch to YouTube is like the trail of tears of the social world
[10730.82s -> 10734.10s]  Well, so we'll be funny is like so many will be lost along the way
[10734.10s -> 10739.52s]  It's more and then they would leave and YouTube would go. Oh people hate this stream and start recommending it
[10740.52s -> 10742.88s]  Cool I'm gonna pick someone with three viewers
[10743.76s -> 10745.76s]  Pass it along wait you
[10746.24s -> 10753.43s]  Get snipers. I'll work on the snipers. Oh, so who wants a raid?
[10755.11s -> 10760.06s]  I just got I'm gonna I'm gonna raid the fucking food is my shift over
[10761.22s -> 10763.22s]  Like we're all does it channel that?
[10764.10s -> 10765.98s]  Scout and medical, right?
[10765.98s -> 10767.74s]  Don't come here
[10767.74s -> 10770.48s]  Yes, what?
[10770.48s -> 10771.76s]  second tank
[10771.76s -> 10774.19s]  Okay
[10778.81s -> 10780.81s]  We've been doing very well
[10780.93s -> 10787.44s]  It'd be really funny if we sent someone everyone to someone that we know and then told them that we expect them to be sent
[10787.44s -> 10789.44s]  back
[10798.71s -> 10805.80s]  We don't have your emotes we don't speak your tongue here like if we come to all of us
[10806.08s -> 10814.03s]  Subs will send all over we find a small viewer. Tell him. Hey, you want this big raid, but you only have it for 10 minutes
[10818.99s -> 10822.77s]  Sounds like a mr. Beast you do your best bit you do the diaper chief fit always
[10823.51s -> 10827.51s]  I'm gonna do if you guys are
[10827.51s -> 10833.37s]  I'll do it. Oh, I thought you meant like if you were the streamer getting raided. What do you do in those 10 minutes?
[10833.37s -> 10836.77s]  You have the viewers. I'm fan. Oh, yeah, you do you your best bit I
[10837.65s -> 10839.65s]  undress Oh
[10840.17s -> 10842.48s]  Well, where are you streaming these days?
[10842.88s -> 10850.74s]  We are about I think to beat an expert aren't we? Yeah, I'm about to I'll pop you right now go
[10850.74s -> 10857.40s]  I'm really surprised pretty easy considering like we're barely paying attention at this point. Yeah, you guys did a great job. This is actually yeah
[10858.88s -> 10860.92s]  Cannot attest to that. I've been dripping sweat
[10861.64s -> 10868.68s]  Now you bit you can pull it and pull a bird big numbers. Love I've been watching you. I've been seeing what you're doing
[10869.48s -> 10872.76s]  See that I see you doing the jump spin down move. I've seen it
[10873.32s -> 10876.60s]  I do like I do to go with that. It's like stupid. Oh, it's like not even helpful
[10878.24s -> 10886.34s]  I've crit for you go. I have two more crit canteens. I'm just gonna give me one at a time go
[10887.10s -> 10892.28s]  And last one go
[10892.36s -> 10903.54s]  I'm just gonna shoot the snipers back there because they're annoying do it. Well, I think we got it
[10903.54s -> 10908.98s]  I think we do think so the the other mission remaining is I think considered to be the hardest one
[10909.58s -> 10911.58s]  Is that the like 99 wave one?
[10912.95s -> 10916.79s]  That's the one of this tour, I mean this the one of this tour is
[10918.27s -> 10919.99s]  Forget the name of it
[10919.99s -> 10925.30s]  But it doesn't look like dust bowl. It's like a whole metal city. We did it. Nice job. Yeah
[10926.34s -> 10927.54s]  I
[10927.54s -> 10931.94s]  Got no way. No way me. No way me. Give me something good, baby. Something good. Something good here

[10944.20s -> 10947.54s]  I have that already. I got that ten years ago
[10952.69s -> 10960.70s]  What the heck nobody got a hat like last time. Oh, all right. It's back up
[10961.14s -> 10966.84s]  All right gamers should this be the end here? I think a lot of fun. That's a good one. Hey, I
[10967.28s -> 10969.84s]  Want to go out heroes, so I'm worried if we escalate
[10970.40s -> 10974.20s]  That was it was awesome. Very very good time. I had
[10975.16s -> 10979.80s]  Seriously, some of the most fun I've had in a while. So yeah, this is a great game and you guys are awesome
