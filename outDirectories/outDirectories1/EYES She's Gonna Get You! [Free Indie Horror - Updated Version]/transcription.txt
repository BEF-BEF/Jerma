[0.31s -> 12.58s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Scare Saturdays.
[12.58s -> 17.78s]  Tonight, we're gonna be playing a game called Eyes, which is a pretty intense game.
[17.78s -> 25.28s]  It's one of those games that I can put in the same category as Slender, where you're being constantly pursued by a monster.
[25.28s -> 29.28s]  But you can actually see through the eyes of the monster that is chasing you.
[29.28s -> 34.48s]  It's a feature in the game, and it makes things a lot more ridiculous, as you could say.
[34.58s -> 37.88s]  But anyways, two things, very important things before the video gets started.
[37.88s -> 42.68s]  One, I'm changing Scare Saturdays to every week, to every other week.
[42.68s -> 47.08s]  So you can expect Scare Saturdays not next Saturday, but the Saturday after that.
[47.08s -> 52.28s]  I want to give myself time to prepare these videos and to get some good scary games.
[52.28s -> 55.58s]  Maybe go back and revisit some of the scarier ones I played in the past.
[55.58s -> 59.88s]  But I want to give myself some time to get these videos at the highest quality they could be.
[59.88s -> 64.38s]  And the second thing I want to say is I scream pretty damn loudly in this video.
[64.48s -> 65.98s]  So just be prepared for that.
[65.98s -> 69.18s]  If you have like a heart condition, then this is a warning.
[69.18s -> 71.95s]  Warning! Scary stuff ahead!
[73.15s -> 77.12s]  Let's go ahead and start this, huh?
[77.12s -> 78.72s]  Something that I just noticed.
[78.72s -> 83.82s]  This is actually on the various app stores for iOS and for Android.
[83.82s -> 89.92s]  And I think it's $1, but it's completely free on the PC, or Mac, or Linux, whatever you happen to be using.
[89.92s -> 95.13s]  Just letting you know if you want to scare the hell out of yourself on an iPad, you can do that with this game.
[95.13s -> 96.86s]  So let's do it.
[96.86s -> 99.60s]  Just want to talk about this break-in business.
[99.60s -> 101.34s]  Already checked it for you.
[101.34s -> 102.64s]  You could get at least 20...
[102.64s -> 105.21s]  Who is talking right now?
[105.21s -> 108.31s]  Hold on, what conversation is going on?
[108.31s -> 113.73s]  Oh, okay, the green is not me.
[113.73s -> 117.23s]  All right, so I'm going for a break-in.
[117.23s -> 117.93s]  Level normal.
[117.93s -> 121.83s]  Find at least 20 money bags, then get back to the exit.
[121.83s -> 125.63s]  Hide and or run from threats.
[125.63s -> 127.23s]  Preserve your stamina for dire situations.
[127.23s -> 131.10s]  Use a map and eyes to move safely.
[131.10s -> 134.85s]  Okay, let's do it.
[137.59s -> 139.09s]  Okay, WASD is move.
[139.09s -> 143.59s]  Wow, these are really wonky, awkward controls.
[143.59s -> 144.79s]  All right, let's get the money bags.
[144.79s -> 147.08s]  Let's like find the Monopoly man.
[147.08s -> 148.28s]  Can I turn this TV on?
[148.28s -> 154.60s]  Okay, whatever.
[154.60s -> 156.67s]  Whatever.
[156.67s -> 160.29s]  Let's see, money bag in here.
[160.29s -> 162.98s]  Push the door to open.
[162.98s -> 164.38s]  M is map.
[164.38s -> 166.18s]  That's a pretty crude map.
[166.18s -> 172.04s]  Oh hey, here's like my little kid's drawing of what it looks like.
[172.04s -> 173.84s]  The mouse is kind of weird too.
[173.84s -> 177.55s]  Oh, okay, so that's what the bags of money look like.
[177.55s -> 180.45s]  Don't even tell me this game is like Slender, where the more bags you collect,
[180.45s -> 182.75s]  like she just chases you around the house.
[182.75s -> 184.25s]  Because I know it's a she.
[184.25s -> 186.30s]  That's what I've read.
[186.30s -> 187.50s]  All right, that's the bag from that room.
[187.50s -> 189.30s]  Let's go.
[189.30s -> 191.84s]  Push to open.
[191.84s -> 195.87s]  What, you just like walk into the door?
[195.87s -> 198.27s]  Why is like grandpa on the wall?
[198.27s -> 199.87s]  Yes, I'm very mad today.
[199.87s -> 201.37s]  This is like a bad...
[201.37s -> 203.97s]  I'm pissed at the person that's a photographer.
[203.97s -> 206.14s]  Fuck you.
[206.14s -> 209.84s]  There's even an older guy.
[209.84s -> 210.54s]  This is awesome.
[210.54s -> 213.70s]  Look at these two old-time son of a bitches.
[213.70s -> 215.14s]  Any more pictures?
[215.14s -> 216.61s]  That's like Hitler.
[216.61s -> 219.20s]  It's weird.
[219.20s -> 221.39s]  Let's go.
[221.39s -> 224.17s]  So you just push your face into doors to open them.
[224.17s -> 231.45s]  Okay, sounds about right.
[231.45s -> 233.62s]  I'm so confused.
[233.62s -> 236.73s]  My field of view is so small.
[236.73s -> 238.52s]  Basement key.
[238.52s -> 240.74s]  Any money bags in here?
[240.74s -> 244.80s]  Ah, 220.
[244.80s -> 246.60s]  Ooh, there's two money bags.
[246.60s -> 247.60s]  Ooh, money.
[247.60s -> 252.57s]  That's good.
[252.57s -> 254.77s]  Can I turn my flashlight off and on or does it have a battery
[254.77s -> 257.60s]  or is it just the way it is?
[257.60s -> 261.07s]  Whatever.
[261.07s -> 262.07s]  Don't walk under the ladder.
[262.07s -> 268.03s]  That's like seven years bad luck.
[268.03s -> 268.53s]  I don't want to like...
[268.53s -> 273.45s]  Can I walk in the attic or something?
[273.45s -> 273.85s]  What?
[273.85s -> 275.45s]  I don't understand what's going on.
[275.45s -> 276.35s]  I don't understand what's going...
[276.35s -> 276.65s]  Run!
[276.65s -> 277.55s]  What do you mean run?
[277.55s -> 279.15s]  Where am I running to?
[279.15s -> 279.65s]  Ah!
[279.65s -> 280.75s]  Jesus!
[280.75s -> 288.77s]  Bruised!
[288.77s -> 293.18s]  Oh!
[293.18s -> 294.18s]  I don't even know where I am.
[294.18s -> 297.77s]  What time zone am I in?
[297.77s -> 304.93s]  Holy shit.
[304.93s -> 309.48s]  I don't even know if I want to play this again.
[309.48s -> 312.48s]  I really don't know if I want to play this again.
[312.48s -> 314.78s]  So when it says run, where am I supposed to just run away?
[314.78s -> 318.10s]  There was nowhere for me to go.
[318.10s -> 323.17s]  There was seriously nowhere for me to go right there.
[323.17s -> 323.87s]  Do I...
[323.87s -> 325.37s]  How do I hide?
[326.59s -> 327.89s]  Oh my God!
[327.89s -> 331.71s]  Oh my God, what do I do?
[331.71s -> 335.50s]  What are the controls?
[335.50s -> 338.92s]  Oh my God, this is horrible.
[338.92s -> 344.23s]  Is there a way to turn the flashlight off and just hide?
[344.23s -> 347.62s]  I don't even want to go out this door.
[355.90s -> 357.10s]  I don't even know where I'm going.
[357.10s -> 359.34s]  I only got like one bag of money.
[359.34s -> 361.24s]  You got to get 20 bags.
[361.24s -> 363.06s]  What is this thing?
[363.06s -> 366.41s]  Press Q to see.
[366.41s -> 366.71s]  Hold on.
[366.71s -> 367.21s]  This is the...
[367.21s -> 368.71s]  This is the monster's sight.
[368.71s -> 371.19s]  I can see where the monster...
[371.19s -> 372.59s]  That's one of the most terrifying things ever.
[372.59s -> 373.59s]  I don't even know where that was.
[373.59s -> 375.73s]  I'm so lost.
[375.73s -> 380.54s]  I'm so lost.
[380.54s -> 381.14s]  I haven't found...
[381.14s -> 383.80s]  Have I found like one bag?
[385.30s -> 386.50s]  Where's the money?
[386.50s -> 387.50s]  This is the worst break-in.
[387.50s -> 390.58s]  This is the worst robbery idea ever.
[390.58s -> 392.75s]  One, one, one, one.
[392.75s -> 393.15s]  For the same...
[393.15s -> 395.75s]  That's a pretty easy combination.
[395.75s -> 396.45s]  Give me that bag.
[396.45s -> 398.86s]  All right, I got two bags.
[398.86s -> 405.22s]  Three bags.
[405.22s -> 406.52s]  Everything's starting to shake.
[406.52s -> 412.65s]  That means she's somewhere.
[412.65s -> 413.55s]  Jesus!
[413.55s -> 421.23s]  Mother Mary!
[421.23s -> 423.03s]  I am not doing very much commentary right now
[423.13s -> 427.13s]  because I am genuinely terrified.
[427.13s -> 431.10s]  Okay, that means she's around.
[431.10s -> 431.70s]  I don't even know where to go.
[431.70s -> 434.90s]  Go, just run up this way.
[434.90s -> 438.19s]  Where is she?
[438.19s -> 441.84s]  I don't even know where that is.
[441.84s -> 443.67s]  Money, here it is.
[443.67s -> 444.77s]  Eight out of 20, eight out of 20.
[444.77s -> 447.27s]  Anything else anymore?
[447.27s -> 448.77s]  We got like George R.R. Martin,
[448.77s -> 458.54s]  the guy that wrote Song of Ice and Fire.
[458.54s -> 459.98s]  Don't blow it.
[459.98s -> 465.29s]  Halfway there, halfway there, halfway there.
[465.29s -> 482.40s]  I don't know what direction I should be going in.
[482.40s -> 483.60s]  No, no, no.
[483.60s -> 484.20s]  I don't know where she is.
[484.20s -> 484.70s]  I don't know.
[484.70s -> 485.20s]  I don't know.
[485.20s -> 485.70s]  I don't know.
[485.70s -> 492.80s]  I just don't know.
[492.80s -> 502.74s]  Oh my God.
[502.74s -> 505.27s]  I love how it tells you to run.
[505.27s -> 506.97s]  It tells you to run,
[506.97s -> 515.64s]  but you don't know what direction you should be running in.
[515.64s -> 517.04s]  Third time's a charm.
[517.04s -> 519.14s]  If I don't make it this time,
[519.14s -> 521.50s]  it's over.
[521.50s -> 526.03s]  I did not get a very good look at that.
[526.03s -> 527.43s]  I got a money bag and another thing.
[527.43s -> 534.50s]  You click these things on the wall and then it's Q.
[534.50s -> 535.20s]  Hold on a second.
[535.20s -> 537.01s]  Is she already over here?
[537.01s -> 547.60s]  What if I hide in the corner?
[547.60s -> 550.11s]  Okay, she must be gone.
[550.11s -> 550.61s]  No, she's not.
[550.61s -> 552.82s]  No, she's not gone.
[552.82s -> 554.40s]  God.
[554.40s -> 556.74s]  God damn it.
[556.74s -> 557.84s]  God damn it.
[557.84s -> 558.84s]  God damn it.
[558.84s -> 559.24s]  She can't.
[559.24s -> 564.55s]  She can't.
[564.55s -> 565.86s]  Well, that's it.
[565.86s -> 566.86s]  I'm not going any further.
[566.86s -> 567.16s]  I can't.
[567.16s -> 569.66s]  This is intense and I can't handle it right now.
[569.66s -> 571.66s]  So thank you all so much for watching.
[571.66s -> 572.36s]  I really do appreciate it.
[572.36s -> 574.86s]  This game is again called Eyes.
[574.86s -> 576.26s]  It's on the App Store.
[576.26s -> 577.16s]  It's only a buck.
[577.16s -> 579.96s]  If you want to hand this to one of your friends on like your iPhone,
[579.96s -> 583.16s]  I think it's iPad or actually maybe you can get it on your iPhone.
[583.16s -> 585.46s]  If you want to hand this to one of your friends and say play this game,
[585.46s -> 586.16s]  it's pretty fun.
[586.16s -> 588.96s]  You go and you like collect money.
[588.96s -> 591.76s]  This is one of the first iOS games I've ever heard of that's
[591.86s -> 594.06s]  that actually has been like a true horror game.
[594.06s -> 598.86s]  The only thing I can think of Year Walk was kind of a scary eerie type game.
[598.86s -> 599.96s]  This game is insane.
[599.96s -> 601.66s]  So thank you all so much for watching.
[601.66s -> 603.36s]  That's all I can do.
[603.36s -> 603.86s]  I'm done.
[603.86s -> 605.26s]  Take care everybody.
[605.26s -> 606.46s]  I love you all.
[606.46s -> 607.46s]  Stay safe.
