[20.54s -> 25.10s]  I changed Twitch servers. Let's see if that does anything.
[26.06s -> 33.99s]  So the stream did turn off. Let's see if it continues to work.
[34.95s -> 45.56s]  Went to a different server. Dude, two streams in one day? What the fuck? Are you serious?
[55.11s -> 57.99s]  That seems barely stable. Let's hope it stays that way.
[59.19s -> 74.10s]  I think, I think it's okay. Let's continue. I'll give it a minute or two for people to realize
[74.10s -> 83.82s]  that we're live again. Remember, just got the notification you went live. Can't wait for
[83.82s -> 94.06s]  another eight hours of Chibi-Robo. All right. What happened? I just got back. The server I was
[94.06s -> 101.11s]  connected to was kind of fucked up, I guess. I'm just gonna let it ride out for a minute.
[102.07s -> 120.78s]  Did you play off stream? A little. Just a little. Just a little bit. Can we get a free
[120.78s -> 132.04s]  wink for our troubles? Sure, why not? Where's the camera? There it is. I think we're good. I
[132.36s -> 161.45s]  think this is solid. Stream might not even turn off. F.A. lap. No drop frames? All right, let's go.
[164.98s -> 177.66s]  Where's that tuber light? Oh, all right. It's a waterfall training?
[179.66s -> 189.22s]  Yes, I want to do waterfall training. Of course I do. This will make your mind sharper than a
[189.22s -> 195.77s]  dagger and your body harder than steel. Listen up, I do not want to repeat myself.
[197.05s -> 209.77s]  March straight down this way, soldier. You'll eventually reach the waterfall.
[210.73s -> 216.09s]  Look at that guy up there having so much fun. When you get there, you'll have to climb to the
[216.09s -> 224.57s]  top and meet up with Private Prisco. So just run over there. Let's go. Dude, you peeked the mic.
[225.85s -> 256.36s]  Easy. No, wrong item. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Climb waterfall. No,
[256.36s -> 268.09s]  you idiot. It's okay. Go like this. Put this shit away. Up. All right. Put it back up. Wait,
[268.09s -> 274.55s]  are they firing at me? Can I climb the vine? Climb the vine. You can't climb vines? I can't
[274.55s -> 299.61s]  climb the vine. Now what? Hello? What the fuck does he want me to do now? What the fuck is going on?
[299.61s -> 307.50s]  That wasn't him? I'm out of battery. I'm dead. Oh my God. I blame the fucking internet on this
[307.50s -> 313.21s]  bullshit. If I wasn't paying attention to the goddamn internet going down, this wouldn't have
[313.21s -> 337.10s]  happened. I just used my battery. I'll be on fiber like within the next 30 days. I can't fucking
[337.10s -> 345.94s]  wait. So this shit is impossible to have it happen again. Ever. Pain in the ass.
[350.25s -> 356.87s]  Five. I'm going on fiber. I just wasted that fucking battery. I'm going back to the save.
[358.36s -> 367.43s]  Right? I didn't even need to use that battery. I got saved by the bell. Where was that last save?
[378.78s -> 395.90s]  Did I not save after the no saves coming? It was before the jungle art. Really? God damn it. Really?
[402.25s -> 415.72s]  Imagine saves coming in chibi robo. Get me on that fucking fiber line.
[416.44s -> 419.72s]  I never have to think about this shit literally ever again for the rest of my life.
[437.96s -> 445.85s]  How much for a wink on fiber? Five dollars, man. Exactly five dollars. He thinks fiber is
[445.85s -> 452.17s]  different. Well, when you have a thousand, a thousand, there's a lot of leeway for you to not
[452.17s -> 473.64s]  have to drop frames streaming at six up. If there's a thousand up, there's a lot more room. I'm gonna
[473.64s -> 501.02s]  save it. Stop throwing shit at me. Who's doing this? All right. I'm going back there and I'm doing
[501.02s -> 528.31s]  this. I want to do it. It's television. It might be. Was there a wink? I didn't see one. Oh, there
[528.31s -> 536.18s]  was a bunch of money. Sorry. It happened during the internet bullshit. Five thousand bits came in.
[536.18s -> 546.62s]  I missed it. Thank you for the fifty dollars. And it was from Sukhoi Flanker. Thank you, Flanker.
[547.26s -> 551.29s]  Hello, Jeremy. Remember when you played stalker two years ago? You gotta finish that. It's too
[551.29s -> 558.89s]  good of a game to just forget. Oh, like stalkers. I think it's been too long.
[559.29s -> 569.59s]  I can't like go back to my save from two years ago and be like, all right, let's go.
[570.55s -> 574.39s]  That's that game's hard and unforgiving. I would have to redo the whole thing over again. I'd have
[574.39s -> 597.19s]  to start it over, which I mean, that's fine. He hates good game. He's gonna do it again. He's gonna
[597.19s -> 615.54s]  scream. What? Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. I was trying to be cute. I was trying
[615.54s -> 617.86s]  to be cute. I was trying to be cute. I was trying to be cute. I was trying to be cute. I was trying
[617.86s -> 620.82s]  to be cute. I should have just jumped up. I was trying to be cute. I was trying to be cute. I was
[620.82s -> 623.38s]  trying to be cute. I was trying to be cute. I was trying to be cute. No more cuteness. Let's go.
[623.38s -> 639.21s]  Chichiburobo is not cute. He's cute, but he's not now. Let's go. Do an impression of Sarge egg. I did
[639.21s -> 647.37s]  one yesterday. I can't do another one right now. It would take like 10% of my soul to do it.
[648.55s -> 657.10s]  You delete like a year off your life when you do a Sarge impression. It's like smoking eight
[657.10s -> 689.30s]  packs of cigarettes. That's the toll it takes. All right, don't shoot me. Watch out. Behind the
[689.30s -> 718.89s]  waterfall. Climb it. Made it. Wow. I almost just fell off. Talk to him. Talk to him. Yeah.
[719.69s -> 743.72s]  Frog ring behind the waterfall. Thank you for your keen eyesight. All right. Got points. That's done.
[743.72s -> 751.51s]  That only took like 28 minutes to just do that one thing because of all the bullshit. All right,
[751.51s -> 762.52s]  now we can move on. We're going to do the thing we came here to do. Talk to him again. More training
[762.52s -> 774.39s]  to do. Look at the ring. Can I even get up there without their help? I've never been up there before.
[775.03s -> 792.63s]  What do you say? More huge bits from Sukhoi again. Flanker. A hundred dollars total.
[793.51s -> 802.41s]  Ten thousand. That's right. Ten zero zero zero. A hundred bucks total from Flanker. Flanker 35.
[803.51s -> 809.18s]  This dude just paid me a hundred dollars to play Stalker. Hold on. Let me read the message.
[809.98s -> 815.96s]  It might not even say that. They say you were at Dark Valley but you need to complete Stalker and
[815.96s -> 820.28s]  if you do not, I will continue bugging you about it till the end of time because I need more Stalker
[820.28s -> 836.04s]  content to watch and I love you and especially your Stalker Let's Play. All right. I have no
[836.04s -> 845.98s]  plans to play Stalker. A Stalker dono. No, no. All right. I have no plans to play Stalker.
[846.30s -> 852.42s]  Right now. I'm playing Mario Sunshine next week. That's gonna take like four days.
[853.06s -> 865.62s]  Play Stalker tomorrow. I'm not gonna play Stalker tomorrow. I was so bad at Stalker. I had no
[865.62s -> 871.93s]  patience. I wasn't very good at it. That's not my game. You want me to play a game that it was
[871.93s -> 881.53s]  embarrassing when I was playing it? And yes, I know I just failed Climb the Vine and Chibi-Robo
[881.53s -> 893.86s]  four times, but there's a difference. It's a big difference. I want to go to the I want to do the
[893.86s -> 916.47s]  the bridge in the kitchen. Stalker after Mario Sunshine. No, I have I have I have no idea.
[917.27s -> 923.19s]  The last time I played Stalker was it had to have been at least two years ago.
[934.70s -> 950.46s]  So you're saying that there is a chance. Well, I'd say more like one in a million. Dumb and dumber.
[950.54s -> 980.22s]  All right, let's go. That's a classic line. What what's his name? Dermal only eats beyond burgers.
[983.03s -> 994.34s]  What the hell is your username? All right, let me get over here. What is that name?
[995.66s -> 1003.03s]  Dermal only eats beyond burgers. Why? Why do you even have that name? That name is fucking crazy.
[1025.34s -> 1037.51s]  Sponsored content. Yeah, for him. Not for me. That's a lot of money. All right. Now,
[1037.51s -> 1043.61s]  what do I want to put the bridge over this way? Look it up there. Oh, I want to clean the grill.
[1044.17s -> 1054.79s]  Yep. Okay. Wait, I want to clean the grill. I'm going down. The fan of the grill. We plug in.
[1058.39s -> 1079.61s]  There's so much junk up in that fan. So much crap up in this man. I can't wait.
[1080.41s -> 1107.10s]  Let's get another 5000 bits. Holy shit. From Flanker again. Flanker. This is 150 dollars.
[1110.02s -> 1119.67s]  More than that. 200? Total? No, 150 dollars and bits. My god. You're a madman.
[1120.31s -> 1128.82s]  Derma, you were doing really good for the point at which you were at the game. I want to see
[1128.82s -> 1134.26s]  stalker. I am a stalker fanatic and I will not rest until you finish your stalker let's play.
[1134.26s -> 1138.26s]  I have nothing to say except that you were doing much better than most other players. Are you
[1138.26s -> 1143.06s]  serious? Wait, is this bait for me to do this? This is that's bait. That's for me to go like,
[1143.06s -> 1146.02s]  holy shit, I was doing better. And that's like a hard game. I'm doing better than players. I could
[1146.02s -> 1158.26s]  do that. Nice strategy. Where's all the junk? Where's all the crap? I want to clean this.
[1158.26s -> 1163.06s]  Why is this clean? I'm pissed off that this is clean. I came up here specifically to just get...
[1163.86s -> 1179.77s]  Why is this clean? I said this last night. I'll say it again. I never rule out ever playing a
[1179.77s -> 1188.23s]  video game. I don't have any plans for it. Who knows? You might see stalker appear on this channel.
[1189.03s -> 1195.27s]  Maybe. I refuse to say I will never play a single video game except for League of Legends. I will
[1195.27s -> 1201.11s]  never do that ever. Literally never. Not one time on this stream. Or Dota. That will never happen.
[1201.11s -> 1212.31s]  Not once. But I will never say that I won't play a game on this stream. I can't climb this. So,
[1212.31s -> 1222.26s]  I don't know. I don't have a... It's not like, oh yeah, that game was terrible. I'm never playing
[1222.26s -> 1227.91s]  it. I just kind of get distracted by other things. New games. Something else happens. So,
[1227.91s -> 1231.67s]  you play something else. You get into something else. You forget about it. You lose track. You
[1231.67s -> 1241.82s]  stop playing it. Who knows? We might come back to it. I don't know. What about Doki Doki Literature
[1241.82s -> 1275.80s]  Club? No, never. No, it's just not gonna happen. I just know it's not. You know what I mean? I know
[1275.80s -> 1292.10s]  it's not gonna happen. Now, what else can I do with this? It can't be just to get across to there,
[1292.10s -> 1299.51s]  right? There's got to be something else I can do with this. Oh, this is not even the bridge, Jeremy.
[1299.51s -> 1315.48s]  This is not even the bridge. How much higher can I get this? All the way up. On top of the fridge.
[1316.04s -> 1321.59s]  On top of the cabinets. Look at that. There's a demon door over there. Oh, yes. Come on. Keep
[1321.59s -> 1334.25s]  going. I can shoot that. I can shoot that thing. Flanker gave more money. Now, that's another
[1334.25s -> 1342.04s]  5,000 bits. That's $200 from Flanker. I don't want you to play Doki Doki Literature Club. I want you
[1342.04s -> 1362.12s]  to finish Stalker. I know, but I don't... I just say yes. I can't. I don't want anybody to think
[1362.12s -> 1371.03s]  I'm gonna play Stalker in like four days. I gotta be realistic with you guys. I need to move this
[1371.03s -> 1385.10s]  forward. You already took the money. I didn't say... Hey, I... Hey, all right. Hold on. I'm gonna...
[1385.74s -> 1392.38s]  Defense mode. Shield going up. I never once said, please pay me hundreds of dollars and I'll turn
[1392.46s -> 1405.74s]  on Stalker. That was not part of a conversation. You don't negotiate.
[1424.12s -> 1438.15s]  He's face down in defense mode. I think Coolsville sucked. No, but I can't say yes. I don't know.
[1439.29s -> 1446.01s]  It's not gonna happen. I've gotta be real. It's not gonna happen anytime soon. Okay, that's it.
[1448.18s -> 1453.54s]  Could this happen in the future? I don't know. But will it happen now? No, it will not. It will not.
[1453.54s -> 1458.10s]  It will not. It's not gonna happen anytime soon. It will not. I just need to be clear.
[1458.10s -> 1482.12s]  I think I got a secret fucking entrance. Jerma Grinn. No, I also don't want to set the precedence
[1482.12s -> 1486.36s]  of somebody paying a bunch of money and telling me that I'm gonna play something and then I go,
[1486.36s -> 1492.95s]  you sure? You bet you. I don't want people to think they need to or will spend like a bunch
[1492.95s -> 1498.90s]  of money to make me play something on stream. If you got recommendations,
[1498.90s -> 1506.57s]  ruin the recommendation channel. I can't... I can't set the precedence of like, all right, hey,
[1506.57s -> 1514.14s]  let's do stalker tomorrow. Let's go, baby. It only costs $200 to make me play something.
[1514.14s -> 1535.43s]  There's a bandage over here. Who's hurt? Lobbyists. Video game lobbyists. Oh, yeah, yeah.
[1535.43s -> 1557.67s]  No, you know what I mean, though. Can I push this? I was told to come here for a stalker stream.
[1557.67s -> 1575.46s]  Jerma, the stalker... I'm not gonna read that out loud. But seriously, thanks for the ridiculous
[1575.46s -> 1589.19s]  amount of money. You've given so much money, too much money. Okay, there's another one over there.
[1589.19s -> 1595.21s]  All right, I gotta get back up there. All right, back up to what I did and I'm gonna go to get the
[1595.21s -> 1608.10s]  other demon door. No, I'm not playing stalker on March 13th. No, stop saying that. Looking
[1608.10s -> 1614.82s]  forward to Lisa the Painful on the 20th. None of this is happening. You're gonna be very, very upset
[1614.82s -> 1636.28s]  to Lisa the 20th. Okay, first of all, you know how that's bullshit? I'll tell you how you know
[1636.28s -> 1645.37s]  that's bullshit. You think I'd plan out what game I'm playing that far in advance? That's what? No,
[1645.37s -> 1651.22s]  I figured out what I'm gonna play like two days ago. Like, I know what I'm gonna play tomorrow today.
[1658.07s -> 1683.80s]  I need 197 more. You told us you had 30 streams planned out. Well, no, I have 30 streams worth of
[1684.36s -> 1692.90s]  GameCube Wii, Xbox 360, and PC games back here. I don't know what order they're gonna be in. I
[1692.90s -> 1707.82s]  just know they're gonna happen. No, stop tagging that account. Stop tagging. All right, all right.
[1707.82s -> 1722.68s]  I'm getting involved. I'm getting involved. I'm getting involved. I'm involved. I'm getting
[1722.68s -> 1740.63s]  involved. I just sub only. I'm getting involved. Subs are doing it too. How could you do this?
[1741.82s -> 1751.22s]  You're supposed to support me. You're supposed to support me in everything. All right, let's go.
[1752.02s -> 1756.18s]  I'm getting involved. All right, we're gonna go back to the kitchen. I'm going up to the top.
[1767.30s -> 1773.37s]  Wallace and Gromit GameCube stream with too, too many fake fans.
[1783.83s -> 1798.39s]  You guys are fucking crazy. All right, I'm going back up because I want to get the other demon
[1798.39s -> 1807.40s]  door. Hey, why is the dog standing? Oh, it's a cleaning game first. Remember emote only,
[1807.40s -> 1826.31s]  sub only, emote only, 10 minute slow mode. I am in control. I am in control. Hey, get down.
[1826.95s -> 1845.86s]  Get down from there. What's wrong? Oh my God. I am in control. I'm in control.
[1848.12s -> 1854.36s]  People are getting thrown into a river around me. I'm in control. I'm in control.
[1872.06s -> 1878.66s]  All right, now take off emote only, take off sub only. Let's hear what the people have to say now.
[1880.58s -> 1906.97s]  Remember, remember who has the power here. Who pays the bills? Who pays the bills? Who pays the
[1906.97s -> 1937.24s]  bills? Who pays the bills? I do. I'm a waiter. Who pays the bills? I do. I'm a waiter. I've been a
[1937.24s -> 1948.55s]  waiter for 15 years and holy shit, you should see my tips. 30% on every check. I'm a, I'm a people
[1948.55s -> 1976.78s]  person. I know how to talk to people. Oh, it's dad or me. What are you going to show us your tips?
[1977.18s -> 1995.78s]  Maybe one day. Help me chibi robo. Oh my God. No, this is a $300 video game request.
[1995.78s -> 2003.16s]  It's gone. It's, it's, it's over that, it's over that portion. Another hundred bucks to get me to
[2003.16s -> 2027.93s]  play stalker. I already know what the message is. Can't flanker insane, insane money, insane amount
[2027.93s -> 2036.26s]  of money. This is completely, you don't need to do this. Unnecessary. Don't worry. Unnecessary.
[2036.26s -> 2043.70s]  Thank you though. Um, I don't want to set a precedent either, right? You can finish
[2043.70s -> 2059.69s]  Super Mario first. I just want to see stalker finished. No, no, no, no. He's setting terms.
[2059.69s -> 2074.58s]  There are no terms. There are no terms. I've been watching you since TF2 and I have to say
[2074.58s -> 2078.10s]  your playthrough up to that point was the most entertaining until it abruptly ended.
[2078.82s -> 2091.08s]  All right. I, hold on. I got a question. This is okay. Hold on. This is a very, very important
[2091.08s -> 2113.30s]  question. Where, where have you been for two and a half years? I'm, why now? It's been a long time.
[2113.30s -> 2117.46s]  I like completely forgot about that game. That's why this is so, so, so hard for me.
[2124.39s -> 2140.15s]  He was waiting for the perfect moment. So about this stalker stream, I've already made my point.
[2140.15s -> 2145.93s]  I've already made my case. You don't have to give any more money. In fact, you do not give
[2145.93s -> 2153.99s]  any more money based on a stalker stream. I'm telling you, I really appreciate the huge fucking
[2153.99s -> 2159.11s]  money. I really do. Thank you. It's ridiculous. It's a ridiculous amount of money. If anybody,
[2159.11s -> 2174.71s]  for any reason, I've taken your point, taken the feedback and I missed a wink. No, I didn't
[2174.71s -> 2184.58s]  pay him to play Sam and Max instead. Jenny said she's hungry, but I'm hungrier than she is. What
[2184.58s -> 2197.00s]  the fuck are you, dad? You get it? Come on, help me make some hamburgers. This is the cooking part
[2197.00s -> 2210.39s]  of the stream. Of course I will. Oh, sweet. A zillion things. Every time I hit the kitchen,
[2210.39s -> 2227.11s]  I end up burning everything. Let's grill some burgers. Okay. How do you cook burgers? Prep work?
[2227.11s -> 2236.28s]  Do I have to help you set those buns on the plates? Why are you putting the bun on the grill?
[2238.02s -> 2245.94s]  They didn't even get toasted yet. Chibi-Robo, it's on the plate. Yeah, I know. You gotta leave it on
[2245.94s -> 2261.58s]  there for at least a few minutes. Is the grill, is the stove even on, dad? Dad, why can't you just
[2261.58s -> 2269.94s]  put these on? Way to go, Chibi-Robo. There's no way I could. Next, we grill the meat. Okay. I'm gonna
[2269.94s -> 2285.00s]  get my fucking secret sauce on there. Get your spoon out. Use your spoon to flip the patty.
[2285.96s -> 2296.68s]  All right. Why is there only one painted on here? You have to label the burgers?
[2297.64s -> 2304.89s]  One, two. Is it five? Cook until both sides are brown. They'll burn if you grill them too long.
[2304.89s -> 2319.35s]  What, why are these two and, look for the three? All right, that one's done. Three and three?
[2320.07s -> 2335.91s]  All right, three. Pick it up. Flip this fuck. Three. All right, this is, wait, this is three.
[2336.71s -> 2359.67s]  Come on. Here's a three. Is it both three? Three, two, fuck. Oh, fuck, I gotta get this over here.
[2359.67s -> 2364.60s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Don't burn, don't burn, don't burn, don't burn, don't burn, burn, burn,
[2364.60s -> 2371.18s]  burn. I wonder if beef tastes good. I mean, it does. All right, is this three? Put it back down.
[2371.90s -> 2382.01s]  Is it three? It is. Oh my god, another hundred bucks just came in. Hold on a second.
[2382.81s -> 2402.26s]  Hold on a second. Flanker again. How much money is this? This is like $400 from, hey, hey, hey.
[2408.76s -> 2413.46s]  They say no prob, this is a hundred bucks by the way. No problem, Jerma. I just love your videos
[2413.46s -> 2435.11s]  and I'm unfortunately broke right now. Give this channel money if you don't have any disposable,
[2435.11s -> 2445.37s]  super disposable income. I gotta make that real clear. Don't make yourself broke.
[2452.92s -> 2457.32s]  All right, here's the tier of where and when we should give this stream money.
[2457.32s -> 2466.46s]  Okay, tier one. It's tier one. So, okay, all bills are paid. You've eaten three times today.
[2466.46s -> 2473.03s]  You've got all the food, all your groceries paid, your rents paid, okay. You went to the
[2473.03s -> 2483.53s]  arcade and blew $50 with your friends. Okay, good. Under that. Underneath that. Did you pay
[2483.53s -> 2494.09s]  for Netflix this month? Okay, underneath that. I'll sit somewhere under there. Do not give this
[2494.09s -> 2502.57s]  stream any fucking money. And I mean zero. Zero. If it's not something that you can absolutely
[2502.57s -> 2520.18s]  afford. For the love of god, please. That's reverse psychology. I have to be clear on this.
[2523.14s -> 2527.86s]  I don't want people to like make themselves broke because they're throwing fucking hundreds
[2527.86s -> 2535.06s]  of dollars at the channel. You know what I'm saying? I don't, I don't, that doesn't sit well
[2535.06s -> 2547.99s]  with me. Anyway, thank you for the huge money. Please take care of yourself first. Don't take
[2547.99s -> 2561.70s]  care of me until you take care of yourself a thousand times first. It's a psychological
[2561.70s -> 2575.05s]  mind game. No, it's a, it's just a reality game. Honey, Jenny, dinner. There's nothing on these.
[2575.05s -> 2592.65s]  Oh, we didn't put the lettuce on. And you banned people from donating. I don't, I don't think so.
[2593.46s -> 2602.98s]  I don't think you can. And his mom doesn't want any. Why?
[2606.73s -> 2612.14s]  It's more fun to eat together. Can I go deliver one? The dog gets a burger. I guess we'll give
[2612.14s -> 2625.13s]  her portion to tell. The dog gets a full cheeseburger. Oh, I forgot chibi robo. And oh,
[2625.13s -> 2642.94s]  we can't eat. We don't eat with robots. Oh, that's right. I forgot. Let's eat one bite.
[2643.58s -> 2658.94s]  Wait, wait a minute. It's raw. Oh yeah. You got the cooking sticker. Oh, nice.
[2659.82s -> 2670.62s]  You really are amazing. Chibi robo. 20 happy points. 20 happy points. Yeah. How gave you,
[2670.62s -> 2684.47s]  oh, the dog gave me happy points too. Nice. I think I did everything in the kitchen.
[2685.03s -> 2690.52s]  Wait, no, the dog, the dog, the dog. Did I get all the things I wanted to get?
[2690.52s -> 2698.57s]  Got that. Did the cooking thing. I did. How many doors are there in here? There's three more. All
[2698.57s -> 2713.88s]  right. I'm going to do the beep beep boop boop thing. Hold on. The crumbs there. Now I'll clean
[2713.88s -> 2722.60s]  the grill. I always just want me to go. There's something apparently up there. I don't think I can
[2722.60s -> 2731.58s]  get up there. Can I? Maybe. Let's find out. Can I get up there? I was up with the, oh yeah,
[2731.58s -> 2741.82s]  I was up there earlier. I don't have the thing. Hey, Jerma, I'm doing huge out of the money
[2741.82s -> 2772.73s]  options trading to sub to you. That's risky. Very risky. Huge out of the money options trading.
[2772.73s -> 2788.65s]  I'm going to plug in first. High risk reward. High risk reward. Don't, okay. Don't listen to me
[2788.65s -> 2802.78s]  when I do my joke streams about stock trading. Don't be like me. More money. How much? $50,
[2802.78s -> 2809.85s]  5,000 bits from ice likes rice. 50 bucks they say here from my SPY puts. What the
[2809.85s -> 2829.93s]  fuck is going on? Look mom. Look what Jerma taught me about stocks. I didn't teach anything.
[2831.00s -> 2838.82s]  I told you that I got fucking messed up from beyond burgers. I fucked it up big time. Don't
[2838.82s -> 2852.04s]  listen to me. All right. Was that radar? But thanks for the $50. Thanks for the $400 fucking
[2852.04s -> 2856.60s]  dolls flanker. Thanks everybody. Thank you. Don't trade options unless you know what the
[2856.60s -> 2861.48s]  fuck you're doing. And I mean it. You need to know what the fuck you're doing. Don't just,
[2861.48s -> 2867.06s]  oh, you know what? I think, I think Tesla is going to go down. I'm going to put a bunch of
[2867.06s -> 2875.30s]  fucking puts on it. Oh, my money's gone in, in less than three days. Oh, well, I learned a few things.
[2876.18s -> 2902.14s]  All right. What's up here? What should I invest my life savings into? I'm not going to save damn
[2902.14s -> 2965.34s]  thing. What is this? Big? Shoot it? The fuck is this? Secret door? Oh, I know what's in my
[2965.34s -> 2985.14s]  portfolio. Any more secrets? No, nothing else in here. I got all the, there's two more doors that
[2985.14s -> 2993.77s]  I didn't get. What do you have in your portfolio? What wouldn't you like to know? I'll tell you.
[2994.49s -> 3005.11s]  In my portfolio. Listen to me. McDonald's. I think that shit's going away anytime soon.
[3005.83s -> 3023.80s]  McDonald's. That's pretty much it. 98% of my portfolio is in McDonald's Limited Group.
[3025.51s -> 3056.58s]  And then 2% into water stocks. Can I do this? I can. I just went right through it. Invest in
[3056.58s -> 3069.75s]  water. Can I not do this then? It don't work. Guys, it don't work. It don't work. All right,
[3069.75s -> 3080.79s]  I'm out. Let's go to the next section. What do I want to do? What do I want to do? Climb up the jars.
[3081.43s -> 3105.53s]  But I can climb the jars? The stream is now out of sync. It shouldn't be. I gotta charge. I can't
[3107.40s -> 3119.48s]  fuck around here. I gotta get up. It is. Okay. I can't climb up on these jars. What a lie.
[3122.62s -> 3127.42s]  Okay, I gotta go. What do you mean it's out of sync? The game's out of sync?
[3128.22s -> 3160.81s]  Video is slightly delayed after the audio. How's that sound? Better?
[3160.81s -> 3188.63s]  It seems fine to me. Okay. All right. Now. Oh, dog. Right. I want to see what's wrong with dog.
[3199.37s -> 3226.38s]  Sing for us or else. What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? Dog, what do you want
[3226.38s -> 3238.86s]  from here? I can't do anything about this. Give the dog the bone? I can't even interact with dog.
[3246.89s -> 3259.32s]  Brain gang? No. No other secrets down here. I'm gonna clean up a little.
[3263.34s -> 3292.47s]  In his bowl. Does that, did that work? Did you give the dog the bone? I did not. Not yet.
[3293.27s -> 3303.93s]  Haven't had an opportunity to. I'm gonna leave the kitchen. I feel like I've done a lot in the
[3303.93s -> 3318.36s]  kitchen. Almost at 3,000 happy points. What is the next actual thing? Right. So I've got this bandage
[3319.24s -> 3325.64s]  bone. The shoe! Oh, I keep putting it off. I gotta do this. I gotta climb the castle. All right. I
[3325.64s -> 3351.66s]  gotta, let's go. I keep getting sidetracked. You know how some games have Twitch integration?
[3353.62s -> 3360.06s]  I keep feeling like that is the Twitch integration of this game. You guys say a command
[3360.06s -> 3377.45s]  enough times and it drops a fucking pan on me. Pan joke is getting old. All right. Let's do it.
[3381.59s -> 3399.45s]  It is in whose room? It's in her room. But let's do some happy points. Yay, Chibi.
[3400.25s -> 3404.20s]  You're a great cook, Chibi. We're best friends.
[3409.16s -> 3429.86s]  Oh, I mean, Ribbit. How do you earn sad points? There are no sad points in Chibi-Robo. This is
[3429.86s -> 3457.48s]  the children's game. Bingo. All right. This thought I was going crazy. I looked over at the stream
[3457.48s -> 3463.06s]  uptime and I saw 57 minutes and I was like, holy fuck, this is the longest hour ever. I forgot about
[3463.06s -> 3471.88s]  the internet thing. 40 happy points for that.
[3482.52s -> 3492.09s]  Wait, there's a new picture? There is a new picture. Is it a clown? What is this?
[3493.45s -> 3518.22s]  Explain this. Tell me what this is. It's mom and dad. It's mom angry. Frog. I did. I already did.
[3521.66s -> 3562.14s]  Sir, we have a problem. Report. Some men have gone AWOL. How could this be? Maybe it's all my fault.
[3562.86s -> 3572.41s]  I'm sure I was tough on him. It was only because I didn't want to lose any more men. But all that
[3572.41s -> 3584.74s]  did was make me lose him faster. Bunkerbusters, what have I done? I'm a disgrace. A soft-boiled,
[3584.82s -> 3593.24s]  undercooked disgrace. I'm not fit to be a fried egg sandwich. That sounds pretty good right now.
[3594.12s -> 3599.64s]  Troops dismissed, you're a disgrace to the name of Free Ranger and I'm not worthy to lead you. Wait,
[3599.64s -> 3638.66s]  I thought this was your fault. But a bonus. How? I gotta be close to another level up, right?
[3639.22s -> 3646.98s]  More battery upgrade. Remember, there's an existential crisis going on right now
[3647.62s -> 3653.29s]  and these prints can wait. Well, yes, there is an existential crisis going on.
[3663.88s -> 3673.58s]  Your happy point bonus is 40. Why so many bonuses? Because I'm just doing so good.
[3674.70s -> 3688.46s]  It's funny. I laugh. All right, let's go. Let's do it. Let's have the cleaning robot solve
[3688.46s -> 3708.18s]  everybody's problems. Oh, the day's gonna end. It's all right. He's laughing at his own joke,
[3708.18s -> 3731.75s]  rested in sleeper. When did I? What? When did I do that? Laughing at my own jokes. I don't do that.
[3732.47s -> 3737.35s]  I'm not the first one to fucking laugh every time I say something. What are you talking about? I've
[3737.35s -> 3746.39s]  never done that before. It's not like you could literally put me in a room by myself and I would
[3746.39s -> 3751.03s]  just entertain myself like next to the wall for like four days straight. It'd be fine.
[3752.23s -> 3758.18s]  Nothing wrong with me. No, no, nothing wrong with me. Something wrong with you.
[3767.86s -> 3781.13s]  All right, day's gonna end. I might as well just let it play up. How crazy you are. Let me get some
[3782.09s -> 3799.86s]  private cargo reporting for duty. Hey, that's, that's what, what are they looking for? Dog tags?
[3804.86s -> 3820.95s]  No, it can't be. Those are Memphis's dog tags. You infiltrated the great airy monster's lair?
[3820.95s -> 3838.12s]  Pipe down. What's going on here? Private chibi robo infiltrated the beast lair
[3839.08s -> 3843.96s]  and brought back Memphis's dog tags. What a bunch of hogwash.
[3845.56s -> 3869.66s]  Let me break. Let me see him. Memphis, I'm so sorry. I couldn't save you. I let you down.
[3871.21s -> 3887.62s]  Forgive me, Memphis. We will never defeat the great airy beast alone.
[3888.10s -> 3910.18s]  We gotta pull together. Men, you're free rangers. You're hard-boiled. One for all. All for one.
[3914.74s -> 3924.90s]  You guys are the best. We owe a lot to Memphis because of him. The free rangers will come back
[3924.90s -> 3935.02s]  stronger than ever. Hold up for a second. What if Memphis is still alive? We gotta get cracking
[3935.02s -> 3945.88s]  and resume our training. Go, go, go, go, go. Anything else? So you survived an operation
[3945.88s -> 3950.36s]  into Tau's lair. For a scrawny house cleaning robot, you got a lot of guts. Bolts too.
[3952.20s -> 3955.24s]  You showed a lot of courage out there. That's why I'm asking you to do me a favor.
[3955.96s -> 3961.40s]  Help instruct our anti-Tau training. I, yes, I don't think it's time to do this today.
[3962.04s -> 3965.77s]  With you on our side, we'll have some serious manpower. Here, I mean, robo power.
[3966.73s -> 3977.96s]  Here, put this on. New costume. Tau's suit. It's a dog costume. Oh my god, this is so stupid.
[3979.08s -> 3986.82s]  Slap me with a battleship. You're even more hideous than the real Tau. The other boys will crack
[3986.82s -> 4004.65s]  when they see you. Head into the backyard. I don't have time for this. Listen carefully.
[4005.37s -> 4012.60s]  We're going to start our Tau training. Okay. This training will help us withstand Tau's
[4012.60s -> 4017.16s]  fearsome bark. Private chibi robo, in this exercise, you will play the role of Tau.
[4019.00s -> 4024.04s]  Press Z to bark and scare all the soldiers. When your battery's below 31, you won't be able to
[4024.04s -> 4029.72s]  bark and you'll fail. Do you understand? Do not waste your bark system only when several soldiers
[4029.72s -> 4070.78s]  are together. Okay, I think I got it. Let's go. Here comes the end of the day. Fuck! I was trying
[4070.78s -> 4078.92s]  to go fast. I was trying to go fast because the day was going to end. Well, I got the costume.
[4079.48s -> 4111.24s]  This is just Sylvester from Looney Tunes. We gotta go talk to mom. Bye, idiot. He was a cat,
[4111.24s -> 4117.67s]  by the way. That made you so mad. You're gonna just leave.
[4126.68s -> 4141.45s]  Back to the chibi house. Try to dump all this into the giga robo thing. I'm gonna put all
[4141.45s -> 4164.34s]  3,000 into it, yep. Can I rank up? Yes! 260. Excellent.
[4166.98s -> 4170.10s]  I need 730. That's a lot. I'm starting to get to the point where
[4170.98s -> 4186.98s]  these are gonna come fewer and far between. I'm gonna do all 3,000. The whole thing. I do.
[4192.66s -> 4193.94s]  One, two, three, bingo.
[4194.34s -> 4218.23s]  More. Four. Another one. This thing's getting kind of close. Is it four more? 4,000 more?
[4220.71s -> 4226.17s]  Okay, cool.
[4236.33s -> 4248.63s]  Get the chibi PC. Basement warp. Anything else in here? Brahma suit. Another battery. Space
[4248.63s -> 4258.09s]  scrambler. A remote control space fighter. Perhaps you can use it someday. What else to do?
[4260.36s -> 4267.66s]  Alright, let's go. Now, my number one priority right now is to go climb the castle.
[4268.89s -> 4274.65s]  I wanna climb the castle right now. I'm not gonna put it off anymore. I've been trying to do this
[4275.29s -> 4282.94s]  the last two and a half straight hours of the stream. We're going. No one will put it off.
[4283.58s -> 4295.72s]  I need the D battery. I think it's over there. More like four hours. Probably. You're probably
[4295.72s -> 4307.18s]  right. Jeremy, do you ever find it difficult to balance streaming in your personal life?
[4307.18s -> 4316.14s]  No, not at all. Not at all. I take a lot of time off. The stream is only live about four times a
[4316.14s -> 4329.18s]  week. So, I take plenty of time off. Because I have to. That's what I do. And that's how I do it.
[4339.91s -> 4345.54s]  Leaving trash. Leaving trash. I told you that doesn't matter. I have one priority. And that's
[4345.54s -> 4367.64s]  get to the top of the castle. But I do have. Actually, I do have some trash. I have a lot of
[4367.64s -> 4389.77s]  twig. Nice. I have a lot of shit in my inventory, huh? I missed oldGermo. Oh, oldGermo on Twitch
[4389.77s -> 4396.33s]  who streamed six hours a week. Two or three days a week. Yeah. I know. Why don't we get that guy
[4396.33s -> 4409.11s]  back? Where's that guy? Can we get that guy back? This stream is like Overwatch for like half the
[4409.11s -> 4420.44s]  time. All right. We're going up. I missed the old SwindlerGermo. What do you mean Swindler?
[4420.44s -> 4452.36s]  What are you? What? Get on his head. Come on, please. Yes. Yes. This used to be a main A stream.
[4452.36s -> 4463.11s]  Now that's a true reference. All right. We're going to go up into the left. Going this way.
[4463.83s -> 4472.46s]  The battery goes on the right. Going over here. So this door. Where we go? All right. We've got
[4473.58s -> 4478.47s]  check it out. I could push this and go up, but I don't think it's why.
[4478.47s -> 4489.11s]  Okay. We're fine. Nothing up here. Wait a minute. They might be. Pull it. No, you dummy.
[4489.99s -> 4501.43s]  Might be able to jump up. That looks like a D battery. That's a D battery. Okay. I know where
[4501.43s -> 4511.27s]  it is. Can I climb from here? No. Okay. Go back down. I'm going to run out of juice.
[4512.07s -> 4540.25s]  I'm going to look at it. Itching nose. Okay. Can I make this? Holy fuck. That was just barely.
[4541.77s -> 4565.96s]  Now I'm going to knock this down with that battery. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, get out of the way.
[4566.76s -> 4577.85s]  I can't drag them. I have to drop down on it. What? Wait, hold on. Okay. I got to.
[4578.49s -> 4588.30s]  There's another battery. This is a battery here. Oh, fuck. Hold on. Can I like to stick this up my
[4588.30s -> 4597.35s]  nose for a second? You just astound me. The goal is within your reach. Go to the lovely princess
[4597.35s -> 4617.51s]  pits and deliver her red shoe. Um, to turn this on. This is where you insert a C battery. I have
[4617.51s -> 4627.66s]  to get. All right. I have the battery. I got to get down. Where does this go? Okay. The middle
[4627.66s -> 4639.54s]  door opened. Good. I have to charge. Yeah. We'll do this again in a minute. Hold on. Stick it in.
[4640.26s -> 4647.00s]  Why are there so many kinds of batteries? Now you're asking the real question.
[4648.12s -> 4653.88s]  Thank you. You are actually asking questions that people have been wondering for decades.
[4654.76s -> 4659.77s]  Why is it not just two or three types of batteries? Why is it like eight different
[4659.85s -> 4666.02s]  batteries? Why can't there just be one type of battery? Why does it need to be AAA or AA?
[4668.36s -> 4673.56s]  Why not just make them all small AAAs? I have D batteries. Why not just make them double A's?
[4674.20s -> 4685.67s]  Different voltages. Why is everything? Everything should be the same voltage.
[4686.31s -> 4708.70s]  It's not that simple. I know. My God. He's a genius. Why didn't we think of that? Shit fucking
[4708.70s -> 4723.72s]  slaps. Let me fix this. My Wii sensor bar just fell off the top of my monitor.
[4724.60s -> 4774.14s]  All right. They're moving good. Let me guess. It's a C. Check the TV. I will later. Please,
[4774.14s -> 4777.66s]  Jerma, finish Super Mario Sunshine when you play it. I'm going to dedicate like a whole week to
[4777.66s -> 4794.28s]  that game. So I definitely will. Okay. Now I'm assuming we're going to jump from one to the
[4794.28s -> 4811.61s]  other. What's over there? All right. Come on. Let's go. No, you idiot. I had it. I had it. I
[4811.61s -> 4838.98s]  gotta wait. I get the cord out of the way. All right. Then around this way. You're going to
[4838.98s -> 4856.38s]  play James Bond for GameCube? I don't have it. I don't have it. Does it come all the way over?
[4856.38s -> 4859.58s]  Yeah. He definitely comes. Let's look at how slow this is. We have one opportunity right here.
[4860.46s -> 4883.22s]  And then we gotta wait till he goes all the way over to the right like this. Okay. Now
[4884.79s -> 4889.83s]  shoot that from here. I think I just got the range upgrade. Good thing I got it because
[4889.83s -> 4897.69s]  this probably would be impossible without it. This would have been impossible. I think I got it.
[4897.69s -> 4915.62s]  Princess, I'm here with your shoe. Oh, my red shoe. Thank you. Thank you.
[4938.26s -> 4950.86s]  Now I can go outside again. 33 happy points. Mort gave you 33 happy points. Yeah.
[4950.86s -> 4961.43s]  Now we can go back and talk to Mort. Let me introduce myself. I am Princess Pits.
[4963.38s -> 4967.78s]  I don't know who you are, but you have my undying gratitude. I had already given up.
[4969.06s -> 4972.26s]  I had resigned myself to spending the rest of my life in the castle.
[4973.22s -> 4983.82s]  I mean, walking outside without my shoe? Please. That would be so icky. Anyway, thank you. If it
[4983.82s -> 4997.90s]  isn't too much, would you be so kind as to tell me your name? Chibi Robo. This is Chibi Robo.
[5000.18s -> 5012.66s]  And my name is? You're the famous Chibi Robo? Telly. Excuse me for asking this,
[5013.46s -> 5016.50s]  but you wouldn't happen to be the one who's been bringing me flowers.
[5017.91s -> 5030.14s]  Why, yes, of course it's been me. It's Mort, right? It's Mort. It's not me.
[5030.86s -> 5046.55s]  I see. Then who could it be? A sweet damsel. Wait, it's not you.
[5048.30s -> 5057.66s]  Drake Redcrest. Hello. Can I help you? I found a flower in the backyard that was almost as
[5057.66s -> 5070.73s]  beautiful as you. It is a special present from Drake Redcrest for you. Mort, I tried.
[5072.18s -> 5080.65s]  Mort, I tried. Drake Redcrest, are you perhaps the one who's been bringing me flowers?
[5083.61s -> 5091.24s]  Those filthy things? I think not. Oh, I see. But I like these filthy flowers. Anyway, thank you.
[5094.94s -> 5099.34s]  Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. What do I say? What do I say? What do I say to fix this? What
[5099.34s -> 5116.26s]  do I say to solve this? Perhaps justice demands filthy flowers. Excuse me. He just thought he
[5116.26s -> 5131.56s]  was a Chad. That was not a Chad move. Well, Princess Pits, if you'll excuse me. Chibi Robo,
[5132.52s -> 5154.92s]  please come and visit me again. Ew, gross. The toys are playing with her. Wait, what's going on
[5154.92s -> 5180.12s]  with the TV? Circle, middle, radar. Hey, dickhead. You want to unplug the TV, please? Jenny's gone
[5180.12s -> 5186.30s]  nutso. She hasn't been sleeping at night because she's all worried about her mom. She doesn't even
[5186.30s -> 5194.84s]  notice me dancing around here. I don't know how to speak rivetees. Holy fuck, you useless motherfucker.
[5195.48s -> 5241.27s]  Get me up here. Turn the fucking TV off. Get this off. Talk to her. She's not gonna say anything.
[5241.27s -> 5248.07s]  Circle, middle, radar. Circle, middle, radar. Circle, middle, radar. I'm turning it off.
[5248.87s -> 5284.68s]  Where does the radar want me to go? Turn this shit off. Is it aliens? Circle, middle, radar.
[5284.68s -> 5291.43s]  Okay. What's the secret thing that's pointing this way? I need to charge.
[5293.90s -> 5302.92s]  I was just up there. I gotta go all the way up there again for the secret. Hold on.
[5302.92s -> 5314.06s]  Nice job ignoring my bits. Oh fuck, there was 50. Yeah, 50 dollars. Holy shit. Sorry, I was
[5315.66s -> 5326.79s]  fully immersed. 5,000 bits from Yes Is Online. Thank you, Yes. They say play the barnyard licensed
[5326.79s -> 5336.30s]  game on GameCube. Otis is my favorite, people happy. Otis barnyard licensed game. Barnyard?
[5336.94s -> 5346.38s]  Wait, isn't barnyard like the animated TV? There's a TV show called Barnyard, right?
[5347.02s -> 5363.32s]  I don't know what barnyard is. What the fuck is barnyard? Barnyard. Yeah, this is a TV show.
[5363.32s -> 5371.85s]  It wasn't a movie. It was a TV show before. It was a movie. It was right. It also had a Wii game.
[5371.85s -> 5386.20s]  Okay, I gotta go all the way up. I was just up there too. Barnyard movie came out first. Wait,
[5386.20s -> 5393.53s]  the barnyard? No, it didn't. It actually traumatized me, what you said. Wait, is that the one? There's
[5393.53s -> 5399.77s]  a pig in it. The pig talks like this. Hey, the pig talks like this. Welcome to the barnyard.
[5399.77s -> 5424.31s]  No, that's Toy Story. That's the pig from Toy Story. Is there a pig in that show? Yeah, there is. What
[5424.39s -> 5458.17s]  does it talk like? All right. It's right here. Not quite. It's lower. Is it right here? Damn. Okay,
[5458.17s -> 5483.54s]  let's go. Nice. How many more? Seven in here. Okay, so we now we have to go use the radar. But look
[5483.54s -> 5490.12s]  at all this stuff. There's lots of stuff in this room. Who's the dancing person? Purple crayon
[5490.12s -> 5508.82s]  zooming on this. What the hell is going on? Okay, we're going up. It's a pirate. Oh,
[5508.82s -> 5514.95s]  shit. You're right. Can I make it from here? Is this a snorkel? Can I make this?
[5524.65s -> 5540.12s]  Why is chat in slow mode? There was so much. There was so many people going like,
[5541.80s -> 5551.48s]  I had to turn it on. There's someone screams. All right, I gotta get better perspective. I can
[5551.48s -> 5561.86s]  probably get up there. I want that to the door. Sit on the mushroom. I did already.
[5563.06s -> 5591.72s]  Did I get it? Let's go use the radar. Look at all this trash. Circle middle radar. Why does Jenny
[5591.72s -> 5602.26s]  just throw over mush all over trash under the bed? Circle middle radar. Wait, is it her doing this
[5602.26s -> 5628.18s]  or is it the mummy guy down here doing this? Okay, let me let's talk. I want to talk to you again.
[5628.26s -> 5639.64s]  Are you just like actually walking around? I gotta pee. It makes me upset. You ever in the
[5639.64s -> 5647.48s]  middle of something and you just have to pee and it just makes you angry? Who throws the word?
[5648.12s -> 5677.16s]  Circle middle radar. Okay, I know. 30 points. Wait, it's a toy telephone. You might be able
[5677.16s -> 5689.75s]  to talk to someone though. I can? I guess not. All right, I'm gonna leave here. I'm gonna plug in.
[5689.75s -> 5697.06s]  I'm gonna circle middle radar. I'm gonna talk to mom again. Go to the bathroom now. I'm all right.
[5697.06s -> 5710.92s]  I'm okay. There's enough time for me to plug in, talk to mom, and then go to the bathroom.
[5711.48s -> 5729.61s]  Day's almost over anyways. There's a guy over here. All right, a lot of things just opened up.
[5729.61s -> 5736.58s]  Let's just go talk to mom right now before time runs out. Use your Razor gamer diaper.
[5739.70s -> 5772.36s]  Yeah, when it's full, you build XP. No. What level am I? 26. XP boost. Yeah, you just gotta
[5772.36s -> 5777.00s]  go get a Mountain Dew. Peel off the XP booster and punch it in the code in.
[5778.60s -> 5780.76s]  It's 30% less urine you need to to level up.
[5799.59s -> 5807.59s]  Of course it does. You have to even ask that question? Of course it does. Okay, let's go.
[5964.09s -> 5991.61s]  See? Right here. Quick. To the point. Right here. Okay. Is the plan. I have a bandage. I have...
[5991.61s -> 6007.45s]  I wanted to go talk to mom. Congrats on being in BG3. What's BG3? Time to water the garden.
[6008.71s -> 6027.24s]  Wait, what's dad doing out there? Baldur's Gate 3? Huh? BG3.
[6047.16s -> 6077.18s]  Okay, dad. Let's do some lawn work. I'll take care of this. All right,
[6077.18s -> 6102.90s]  let's start playing the Michael Myers theme song for a second. Wait, wait, wing? Okay, hey.
[6102.90s -> 6112.42s]  You're watering the tree? What is he... Dad, you're spraying down the swing? What's wrong with you?
[6114.23s -> 6119.10s]  Aren't you the neat freak, chibi robo? I won't be using that toothbrush again,
[6119.10s -> 6130.58s]  but if you're using it to clean, I'm fine with it. Watering the rocks. What a waste of water.
[6131.86s -> 6136.23s]  I'm gonna do my best with the chores until Jenny's mom is in a better mood.
[6137.03s -> 6155.98s]  Why are you saying Jenny's mom? I'm counting on you, chibi robo. Can I do anything in here?
[6175.50s -> 6208.94s]  Look at that secret door. It's a translation issue. I guess so. All right, any more secrets out in the
[6208.94s -> 6220.74s]  backyard? Nope. Can I do anything with dad? I went all the way up to the top of the tree.
[6220.74s -> 6232.50s]  There's a fucking weirdo up there. Remove the weeds. Oh, there's a weirdo up there. How do you
[6232.50s -> 6254.17s]  remove weeds? Dig? Hold on. I gotta talk to the weirdo. Chibi robo.
[6255.13s -> 6261.37s]  If you stand there, you'll get all wet. That's dangerous business for a robot.
[6262.89s -> 6296.54s]  Stand back. You're not my dad. You actually are not my dad. All right, what's this weirdo doing up
[6296.54s -> 6307.91s]  here? Keep it down, will you? We're not supposed to be talking right now. I am Macon. I'm training
[6307.91s -> 6314.84s]  to become a pirate, sir. You are, sir. Watering the lawn is great. It's like I'm in a rain cloud.
[6316.47s -> 6323.11s]  Captain Plankbird is recruiting. Thanks for letting me know. Macon just gave you 26 happy
[6323.11s -> 6338.34s]  points. Oh, this is... you just have to tell them. Oh, there's a door over there. Hold on.
[6338.34s -> 6350.73s]  There's a door there and some shit over there. White block. I think I might need a tool to do
[6350.73s -> 6391.26s]  that. All right, it's saying pull weeds, so pull these. Can I pull these up? Weeds. Weeds. Oh,
[6391.26s -> 6398.30s]  that's why everyone wanted me to pull up the weeds. Jerma, pull the weeds. No,
[6398.30s -> 6404.60s]  Jerma, you can pull those weeds up, you know. Jerma, the weeds can be pulled. Did you know?
[6404.60s -> 6422.76s]  Cannot and day hot? What does it say? Cannot and today hot. Cannot and today hot. Well,
[6422.76s -> 6437.53s]  sunny out. It's been a while since I got any scrap. What does it say?
[6453.74s -> 6461.16s]  So, I gotta go out here at night time. That makes sense. Now, what about over here? There's a little
[6461.16s -> 6480.62s]  garden here. Can I plant the nectar flower here? Yes, I can. No, I can't. Plant the weed?
[6481.58s -> 6491.67s]  I'm not gonna plant in weeds. All right, let's come back here at night.
[6492.39s -> 6513.82s]  Got it. I got it immediately. I'll come back here at night. Oh, wait, there is a bird up there.
[6513.82s -> 6522.06s]  What does a bird eat? Bird seed? Do I have any food for the bird? Weeds, twigs, cookie crumbs,
[6523.02s -> 6541.69s]  bones, a cookie, the nectar? Nectar! Will the bird eat the nectar? Gunpowder. No, that's not
[6541.69s -> 6550.47s]  gonna happen. All right, yeah, let's feed the bird nectar. Gotcha. This game is so fun. I'm so glad
[6550.47s -> 6583.56s]  I got this game. This is great. This is really great. I like this. Sure, we'll save it. You got
[6583.64s -> 6590.63s]  not bought. That's where you're wrong. Start with the pirate emote. I did buy. I did bought.
[6591.35s -> 6605.72s]  I do own. The ISO cost 100 bucks. No, I have the physical, video, game, disc, original,
[6605.72s -> 6612.44s]  in circulation. I have it. I own it, and it's mine. In 30 years, I'm gonna sell it for five grand.
[6613.08s -> 6637.54s]  I showed it yesterday. It's in the Wii right now. Did it come with a case? Yep. This is original.
[6638.26s -> 6643.54s]  It's got the manual. It's got the case, and it's got the disc, and the disc is in liquid pristine
[6643.54s -> 6654.20s]  condition. It is like crystal. No marks, no nothing. It is pristine. I'm gonna shrink wrap
[6654.20s -> 6662.65s]  this fucking thing. When I'm done completing this game, it's going back in the case and getting
[6662.65s -> 6678.90s]  shrink wrapped. Let's give nectar to the bird. You're scamming, scammering. No, I'm not gonna
[6678.90s -> 6687.35s]  tell. That's not to... Hold on. What do you got? Ooh, chirp, chirp, chirp. Do I have to have a bird
[6687.35s -> 6704.07s]  costume to speak bird? Chirp, chirp. Okay. I think he's half asleep. Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
[6724.01s -> 6729.93s]  Yikes, I overslept. Chirp. You look at the time. I almost missed my date.
[6729.93s -> 6735.45s]  Holly will peck my eyes out if I'm late. Last time she plucked all of my feathers. I had goosebumps
[6735.45s -> 6753.80s]  for a week. Thanks for waking me up. Chirp. You seem grateful. Way to go, Chibi-Robo. Now we can
[6753.80s -> 6761.27s]  keep going. We can get on the roof. We can get on the roof. It's roof time. Careful. Demon door.
[6765.08s -> 6783.86s]  Oh yeah. All right. Anything else up here? Wait, let's break this. Two demon doors.
[6783.86s -> 6788.52s]  There's a bunch of dirt up here. The bird shit. I'll get the bird shit in a minute too.
[6788.52s -> 6818.63s]  Clean. Save the battery. Can I fix this somehow? Um, can I get it? Just jump. Hold on. Can I get
[6818.63s -> 6833.50s]  across this? Boy. No! What just happened? What? I was trying to shimmy. What the fuck? The camera
[6833.50s -> 6842.20s]  moved a little. The camera moved and it... That was weird. All right. Hold on. Let me charge up
[6842.20s -> 6864.71s]  again. So LOL bad. Oh, he's blaming the camera. Fucking the camera's fault. The camera sucks.
[6866.62s -> 6881.38s]  Oh, I just... I wasn't expecting it. I was shimmy. Fake gamer. I'm not even a real gamer.
[6882.34s -> 6888.95s]  I used to be. I was so good. Did you see my TF2 one live gameplay when I got like 28 kills?
[6889.51s -> 6896.54s]  One life. I used to be so good. I had like 37 kills in one life as a demo man. Oh,
[6900.36s -> 6911.06s]  you're just old now. That's what happens. Oh, but man, back in the day. Oh, I'm so good.
[6911.78s -> 6915.43s]  I'm gonna walk behind him because I don't want that cut scene to trigger again.
[6915.99s -> 6926.44s]  Oh, that's what happens when you when you beat Sekiro. When you beat the last boss in Sekiro,
[6926.44s -> 6929.64s]  I'm doing that because I just want people to think I still kind of got it.
[6930.60s -> 6934.78s]  That's what I thought. What are the purpose? Does that serve? This is how you guys know
[6934.78s -> 6958.49s]  that I still kind of got it. And this game is like 100 bucks on eBay. We'll just wait
[6958.49s -> 6973.46s]  till you type in, uh, cubivore. Check that one. I don't, I don't have that one. I do not have that
[6973.46s -> 7002.06s]  one. You're back? Get out of the way. Oh, you again. I thought you died. I thought you fall
[7002.06s -> 7012.20s]  off the roof there. Figured you'd never gonna come back. You got anything to eat? Cookie crumbs.
[7012.84s -> 7029.29s]  Oh, get out of the way. That's what I wanted to eat. Mm. Tap you a little one. Uh, and it made
[7029.29s -> 7040.47s]  them big. All these crumbs have made me thirsty. This is going to ruin my singing voice. Water's
[7040.47s -> 7060.70s]  good, but I much prefer the sweet nectar of a flower. All right, we have that. Just fall off
[7060.70s -> 7076.01s]  again. All right, let's not fuck this up again, please. Awful wink. Want a refund. There's no,
[7076.01s -> 7100.22s]  there are no refunds. Okay, this is what happened last time. The camera went, here we go. Oh, look
[7100.22s -> 7127.05s]  at all these trinkets. 10, 15. Nice. I got to 75k. No way I'm going to use it on a mere blink.
[7127.05s -> 7144.06s]  2250. All right, how many more? There's one more door out here. Isn't there one right here?
[7144.06s -> 7150.12s]  Wish I could zoom out. Can I zoom out? Kind of, not really. Where is it? It's like on the wall,
[7150.12s -> 7178.07s]  right? Right here. Where is it? I remember seeing it. Is it right? Where is it? Oh, cube. White block.
[7178.07s -> 7207.10s]  Now where is that other door? There it is. Okay, right there. I'm going to shimmy across the drop
[7207.10s -> 7235.26s]  of the dork variety. Yeah, I got all the doors in the backyard. No more. Eight out of eight,
[7235.26s -> 7240.66s]  completed. Backyard's pretty much done. Oh, I do want, I want to get the bird nectar. We'll do
[7240.66s -> 7259.03s]  that too. Let's close that out. This is a real gaming hours. Yeah, I guess so. Am I going for
[7259.03s -> 7270.70s]  100%? Um, yes, but not on the way you think. I'm going for 100% personal fulfillment. When I've had
[7270.70s -> 7277.37s]  enough and I'm done and I want to complete, I'm going to complete. That's my 100%. That might
[7277.37s -> 7290.42s]  mean do a shitload of side quests. Maybe not all of them, but enough of them. You sound like my
[7290.42s -> 7307.19s]  youth pastor. It's the 100% happiness run. That's happened 14 times. Yes, it has. Can I get up there
[7307.19s -> 7338.06s]  before the day is over? I'm going to be close. Probably not. Hurry, hurry. Gibi robo, get away
[7338.06s -> 7384.07s]  from there. Sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep. Sheep, sheep, sheep. Go so close. Stop. Go.
[7387.66s -> 7402.55s]  Nectar. Hey, look what I got. Yay, nectar. Glug, glug, glug. That really hits the spot.
[7402.55s -> 7408.09s]  Nothing beats natural nectar. Chirp. You've been great, but I need one more thing. I've been eating
[7408.09s -> 7413.45s]  a lot of junk lately and need some veggies. See any around? Balanced diet is important. If you
[7413.45s -> 7417.69s]  don't have your health, you don't have anything. You don't look so good yourself. Try not to work
[7417.69s -> 7426.57s]  too hard. I came to this town so that everyone could hear my lovely voice. Weed. Should I give
[7426.57s -> 7442.94s]  them weeds? Counting on you to get me my veggie. I have weeds. That's dumb. I have to do it again
[7442.94s -> 7467.34s]  tomorrow. Maybe a twig? Maybe. Make them a Sisu salad. Seed? We'll find out. It's either weed,
[7467.34s -> 7482.04s]  twig, or some kind of seed. Waiting for the countdown now. Dang. Come up with that connect,
[7482.04s -> 7499.30s]  Jerva. I'm going for it. Birds eat sticks? Well, birds eat seeds and, I don't know, leaves?
[7507.50s -> 7515.13s]  Bugs? Birds don't eat sticks. Birds do not eat wood. They don't do that.
[7516.09s -> 7531.11s]  I'm gonna save my money. There's only one thing I can buy. It's the spaceship. Does the basement
[7531.11s -> 7534.95s]  warp? Warps you from place to place. Placed on both ends of the stairs. Yeah, I just get it.
[7535.91s -> 7548.62s]  Woodpeckers don't eat wood. Yeah, I know. They're not eating it. They're borrowing.
[7550.38s -> 7557.93s]  They're borrowing to eat bugs. They're making a hole so they can eat the bugs out of the hole
[7557.93s -> 7559.77s]  that they're borrowing with their nose. They don't eat wood.
[7559.77s -> 7580.90s]  The utility bots just gave you a hundred happy points because I did it all. You got the utility
[7580.90s -> 7594.31s]  bot sticker. You really are amazing. You've done it all. You're the best. I actually need to look
[7594.31s -> 7601.50s]  at the stickers. I haven't seen them. Scrap trade? Exchange rate. One scrap equals one. Oh, so now
[7601.50s -> 7610.04s]  I've gotten to a point where I bought everything. The space scrambler and chibi battery. I'm not
[7610.04s -> 7637.42s]  gonna buy either one of them. I'm like one sub. All right, it's night time. You know what that
[7637.42s -> 7665.78s]  means. Back outside. Do the radar. Is the bird there? The bird's sleeping at night. He's up there.
[7667.11s -> 7730.98s]  I'll do that after. Am I calling a UFO? Wait, they're all robots. They look just like me.
[7730.98s -> 7751.18s]  I don't speak alien. I need an alien costume. I don't know what they're saying. Oh, what? I don't
[7751.18s -> 7801.29s]  know. Alien council. Should I say yes? Yes. I asked you if you liked pineapple on pizza. Well,
[7802.25s -> 7811.37s]  was that you chibi robo? What do you mean was that me? You're losing it chibi robo.
[7811.93s -> 7816.38s]  I only asked you that to test you. Get a hold of yourself bot. Those were aliens.
[7816.94s -> 7819.58s]  I've seen them on tv but this is the first time I've seen them in real life.
[7826.20s -> 7835.67s]  They're smaller than I would have thought. They were very shiny but their voices were so quiet
[7835.67s -> 7841.67s]  I couldn't make out what they were saying at all. Oh, I know. I'll ask Citrusoft if they have a
[7841.67s -> 7851.83s]  chip that can help you hear their voices. Well, they're gone. They've left. Maybe Citrusoft can
[7851.83s -> 7872.38s]  give us something. Okay. Now what? I have a bandage. The bone. The weed. Bird. Is he sleeping?
[7873.10s -> 7889.91s]  I'll wake him up and feed him. First thing I see in chat is what I'm going to eat tonight for food.
[7890.87s -> 7924.06s]  Is it an egg? No. No, I don't think so. It was eggs but I really don't want to eat eggs. Hey,
[7924.06s -> 7938.44s]  I'm back. Don't you have a way to speak to animals? Wait, this is the way to talk to all animals.
[7938.44s -> 7948.09s]  So why is the frog suit just frog? I need a vegetable that's super duper nutritious. It
[7948.09s -> 7961.50s]  might be pretty tough to find one but I'm sure there's one nearby. Okay, anyone that's super
[7961.50s -> 7965.66s]  nutritious? I might be pretty tough to find one. I'm sure there's one nearby.
[7971.99s -> 7993.18s]  I don't have it. Eggplant? Eggplant? Where's there an eggplant?
[7995.53s -> 7998.36s]  What about over here? I'm going to sneeze.
[8005.29s -> 8036.41s]  Your head. Nutritious eggplant. There ain't nothing here. Looks not on your thousand dollar mic.
[8037.05s -> 8049.45s]  Wait, hold on. There's a spot up here. Remember I was trying to figure out what the hell to do
[8049.45s -> 8066.57s]  with it? I mean, this might be a shot in the dark or whatever. It was a little patch somewhere
[8066.57s -> 8077.48s]  over here, right? Where is it? Up into the right. There's a little spot. Where is it? Am I crazy?
[8077.48s -> 8086.46s]  I think I'm, yeah, I'm crazy. No, I'm not. It's over here, right? It's right there, right there.
[8086.46s -> 8107.62s]  Yeah, I know. I'm not crazy. What the hell is this? There's nothing. I really can't get in here.
[8107.62s -> 8131.67s]  Oh, maybe not. I guess it's not.
[8136.94s -> 8150.26s]  Oh well. This has to be here for a reason though, right? What else will this be here for?
[8151.70s -> 8174.55s]  Oh well, okay. I'll just come back later. Let's move. The next order of business is...
[8179.00s -> 8193.16s]  What is the next order of business? Go back to the, and get the chip.
[8193.80s -> 8204.02s]  I think I didn't spend any money. All right, can I talk to the dog? I can talk to the dog with this
[8204.02s -> 8220.26s]  on. Let me go see if there's a new chip. I could hardly believe my eyeballs when I saw those aliens.
[8220.26s -> 8224.50s]  Shocking, simply shocking. I couldn't quite figure out what they were saying. They were speaking so
[8224.50s -> 8231.14s]  softly. I almost forgot. I think Citrus Soft makes a chip that would allow you to hear soft voices.
[8232.02s -> 8240.07s]  I'll contact them right away. I knew they had something like this. It's called an alien ear
[8240.07s -> 8255.62s]  chip. But they know. How much is it? Okay, we'll bring it back. All right, let's go.
[8256.58s -> 8280.63s]  That can't be more than like 2,000. 2150 alien ear chip. Fine. So let's go back out there and
[8280.63s -> 8292.31s]  do it again. Maybe I can actually hear them this time. Maybe if I, uh, maybe the first thing in
[8292.31s -> 8303.10s]  chat that's not an egg is a food item. I'm going to eat pizza. Okay. Thanks for playing.
[8303.74s -> 8332.36s]  It was pizza. I said hash house at gogo. Yeah. And you are one of the smartest people in this
[8332.36s -> 8338.38s]  whole room. You have to be. You have to be one of the smartest people in this whole chat room.
[8339.48s -> 8348.01s]  Absolutely. 1000% positive. All right, let's go. I have the chip installed. Let's see if we can do
[8348.01s -> 8363.32s]  this again. Oh, so we're stupid. No, I just said that that person was one of the smartest people
[8363.32s -> 8370.17s]  in the room. Look, if somebody was in this room right now and had 155 IQ, I'd be like,
[8370.17s -> 8374.73s]  you're smarter than me, but I'm smart. Like if I have 140, that doesn't make me stupid. That
[8374.73s -> 8381.30s]  doesn't make you the smartest person in the room. Why are the frogs back? Oh, fuck. I have to talk
[8381.30s -> 8397.86s]  to them with a frog suit. Thank you so much. Long time no see chibi robo. Can I ask you something
[8397.86s -> 8404.49s]  ribbit? It's been so dry here lately. This keeps up our minds and bodies will scribble up like
[8404.49s -> 8408.73s]  disgusting prunes. Well, you weren't out here when dad was spraying water making giant puddles
[8408.73s -> 8417.64s]  everywhere in mud. This is over the last full day. We need to stay moist the frog way. We used to
[8417.64s -> 8423.70s]  bring the rain with a rain ritual. But now there are only two of us and we need three frogs to do
[8423.70s -> 8434.57s]  it. Can you help us with our rain? Yes, of course. I would be honored. Let's do it. The rules aren't
[8434.57s -> 8441.34s]  easy. Adjust your timing so that you crouch at the same time as us with Z. Watch our movements
[8441.34s -> 8461.45s]  carefully and get the timing right. Let's go. We're doing it right now? Wrong. When we crouch
[8461.45s -> 8489.53s]  together, press Z at the same time. He's fucking up too. Don't get mad at me. He did it. You did
[8489.53s -> 8512.50s]  it before alone. So why are you only mad at me? I love the sounds. They're so good. A healthy snack
[8512.50s -> 8524.66s]  and a grow from that garden. Yay rain. Thank you chibi robo. You are so welcome. It's not only
[8525.22s -> 8539.67s]  just for frogs. I bet the flowers are happy too. 100 happy points. You got the frog sticker.
[8541.16s -> 8552.34s]  Their whole arc has been completed. Frog arc complete. Now I think there might be a healthy
[8552.34s -> 8566.74s]  snack over there. Let's go look at the stickers. There's one right here. Frog. What was I doing
[8566.74s -> 8578.94s]  here? Oh yeah, this. All right, come back. I'm back so I can actually understand you.
[8584.09s -> 8590.49s]  Now it's daytime, isn't it? It's technically the morning. Is it because of the suit?
[8591.45s -> 8621.50s]  That's because it wasn't the frog suit on. We're back. Aliens. Wow, wow, wow. This is the first
[8621.50s -> 8631.14s]  time I've seen one in real life. We are aliens. We are here to see friend. We made promise to
[8631.14s -> 8642.30s]  friend. Must see now. Are you friend of friend? Where is friend now? Are they talking about the
[8642.30s -> 8647.88s]  they're talking about gigajad? Chibi robo, let's show them the way to their friend.
[8648.82s -> 8658.14s]  Yes, way to go chibi robo. Keep this up and we'll be at the top of the chibi robo rankings. Do your
[8658.14s -> 8670.01s]  best. All right, everybody get inside my head for a little bit. You watch ship. We follow you. Thank
[8670.01s -> 8684.65s]  you. A little stingy on the happy points. Lo just gave you six. Ganymede just gave you six. They're
[8684.65s -> 8704.58s]  all Jupiter moons. Wow, wow, wow. Chibi robo, the aliens gave you happy points. Titan, Titan, Lo,
[8704.58s -> 8715.02s]  Lo. Ganymede, Ganymede. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I know. Wait, I'm bringing them through
[8715.02s -> 8720.66s]  the house. Guys, this is not really how this works. Usually how this works is you get inside my head.
[8721.93s -> 8731.62s]  All right, we gotta go. What if the dog kills them? All right, follow me. Wait just a minute.
[8734.76s -> 8745.46s]  Who decides what is justice and what is evil? What is justice? What is evil? I don't know. You
[8745.46s -> 8752.78s]  cannot fool me disguising yourselves as space hunter robo. I know you've come to annihilate this
[8752.78s -> 8764.47s]  world, hideous extraterrestrial friends. I must stop you somehow. Space hunter robo, I don't want
[8764.47s -> 8771.74s]  to believe that you're an agent of evil. However, if evil exists, justice will defeat it. That is
[8771.74s -> 8785.46s]  what justice is all about and I am the hero of justice. All right, push him into the beam.
[8786.10s -> 8804.87s]  Space hunter drake redcrest. Not a guess, not a guess. Humiliation is a cruel mistress.
[8806.12s -> 8820.34s]  I seem to have run out of gunpowder. I'll let you go. Your day is numbered. Adios. I have that.
[8820.34s -> 8838.71s]  What was that? That was cool. Alien is amigo. I want to meet amigo. Let's go. Drake redcringe.
[8840.23s -> 8846.15s]  All right, we need to go to the basement. Basement. Basement. The quickest way to the
[8846.15s -> 8854.34s]  basement is foyer. We got to watch out for the dog. Follow me. And if you see any trash, pick it
[8854.34s -> 8870.41s]  up. That's what we do over here. That's what we do on earth. It looks so happy when I pick it up.
[8870.41s -> 8890.12s]  They do a jumping jack. It's me and the boys. Shadow clones. Okay, foyer. What about the...
[8890.12s -> 8897.43s]  Are we going to get attacked by the eggs? Let's go. Come this way. Let's avoid a conflict here.
[8909.19s -> 8912.87s]  I wanted to pick this up, but I was going to hang out for a minute. Come take a seat.
[8913.75s -> 8921.54s]  Come see your friend. Hey, wait. Can you... Does your ship have 4,000 power by any chance?
[8922.18s -> 8941.27s]  I just went to the kitchen. Oh, you sure don't? I thought you knew where you were going.
[8942.23s -> 8950.47s]  GP robot, why is the GPS turned on? You've been down this road 2,000 times. I know. I know. Shut
[8950.47s -> 8985.51s]  up. Just fucking have it on it, right? Oh, look. Wait, don't touch that. Look who I got. Okay, so
[8985.75s -> 8994.38s]  you ain't the fighting kind of alien. Okay, good. You're the exploration aliens. I couldn't have
[8994.38s -> 9010.76s]  gotten to one group of fighting aliens. Friend, pal, buddy. Uh, he's dead. I forgot to mention
[9010.76s -> 9019.91s]  that. He died like 30 years ago. Did I tell them that before we came down here? Thank you. Thank
[9019.91s -> 9041.53s]  you. 33, 33, 99 points. Your achievements are already on a universal scale. We came to fulfill
[9041.53s -> 9057.27s]  our promise. What did you do to our friend friend? Yeah, I'm working on that. I'm working on putting
[9057.27s -> 9066.57s]  them back together. It's been slow going. You see that there's like a divorce going on. I know
[9066.57s -> 9070.57s]  there's like intergalactic shit going, but like there's a frog girl up there I had to give rings
[9070.57s -> 9084.65s]  for. It's been a long process. I paid off the rockets. Ally immobile. Is savior sick? Is mate
[9084.65s -> 9093.14s]  cold? Yeah, shut your core colors for a second. Are you asking about Giga Robo? Hey, he's as stiff
[9093.14s -> 9112.33s]  as me beard. Friend has stopped. Friend does not move. Friend has died. We promised. Friend,
[9116.36s -> 9141.06s]  we are too late. We are sorry, friend. No good. Sad. Are you all grieving for me shipmate Giga
[9141.06s -> 9154.98s]  Robo? What a kindly bunch of critters you be. I can't stop me tears. Tears are all tiny oceans
[9154.98s -> 9162.81s]  of sorrow. Tears from a poem I penned once. I forget I said that. Pirates don't write poems.
[9163.53s -> 9181.03s]  Just another part of the pirate's code. I'm sorry. I'm okay. We leave the part. Withdraw.
[9189.46s -> 9233.88s]  I hate your fucking vacation. I'm crying. You're crying. Well, we just have to bring him. We have
[9233.88s -> 9240.60s]  to charge him and then bring it. Okay. I'm not here. How much money do I have? We just have to
[9240.60s -> 9246.31s]  charge him back up, bring him back to life, and then bring the aliens back down. It's that simple.
[9246.31s -> 9277.02s]  It's so it's a very easy simple equation. Go gamble for 4k. What's going on over here? Help
[9277.02s -> 9293.24s]  instructor. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How do I like the game up to this point? I think it's a
[9293.32s -> 9315.30s]  so like I think it's a solid it's 6.1 6.2. No, this game's fucking awesome. It's so good.
[9315.30s -> 9339.80s]  It's amazing. It's like, I don't know. It's very good. Come on, bunch up. All army K.O.
[9339.80s -> 9348.10s]  Tao training cleared. I think it's fantastic. I love it. Thanks to you, my men are ready for
[9348.10s -> 9362.25s]  the worst. They're prepared to face the great furry evil. I think I've upgraded. Our training
[9362.25s -> 9367.53s]  is over. We gotta come up with a plan to save Memphis. Once we've drawn up our battle plan,
[9367.53s -> 9371.53s]  we'll be ready to take on the great hairy threat. We'll need you when the time comes.
[9372.65s -> 9380.98s]  It's time we take the fight to the enemy. It's time we Romnibus Romnibus, whatever that means.
[9380.98s -> 9396.20s]  Help us take down the tyrannical Tao. Let's talk to the dog. I think we need the dog side of the
[9396.20s -> 9433.99s]  story. I don't have time to do anything else. Centrist. What a centrist. You, I remember you.
[9433.99s -> 9439.88s]  Go join the pirates. They're looking for people. Hey, yeah, word is you got a hot rod.
[9440.84s -> 9448.42s]  How about a little game of chicken? Game of chicken. But you want me to drive and you want
[9448.42s -> 9455.26s]  to drive into each other. Why would we do this? Whoever stops closest to the edge wins. Press B
[9455.26s -> 9482.01s]  to slam on the brakes. What? I'm not driving the car. Okay, the brakes take a little while.
[9482.01s -> 9499.38s]  Oh, GV Robo. Take this, you crazy robot. Let's do it again. Yes. All right. I thought it was
[9499.38s -> 9522.02s]  going to be hit and stop immediately, but you have to, okay, I get it. This really is a great,
[9522.02s -> 9541.91s]  this really is a great Wii game that came out 500 times. Oh, come on. He's giving me 50 bucks.
[9541.99s -> 9551.94s]  Can I just grind this 50 dollars every time? I stopped that pretty quick. I stopped that.
[9556.55s -> 9572.12s]  Almond or wifi. Does this work? Almond or? Almond or? Almond or? Almond or? Almond or? Almond
[9572.12s -> 9583.42s]  or? Almond or? Almond or? Almond or? Almond or? Almond or? Good work. I had to have done it. Not
[9583.42s -> 9598.94s]  terrible. Pretty close. Let's see. Oh, you did. D. How did I get a D? That was so good.
[9601.38s -> 9612.50s]  Give it a rest, man. Come back later. How was that a D? That was, that was, that was so good. That was
[9612.50s -> 9640.23s]  so, well, that's kind of not fair. I got really close to the edge. I was almost over the edge.
[9653.51s -> 9670.36s]  I'm pissed off. Let's go into mom's room while I have some minutes here. Here this game is three
[9670.36s -> 9709.50s]  games and then a final grade. Oh, there's something here. Later. Is this the Almond or wifi streamer?
[9722.07s -> 9734.39s]  Mom, wake up. You have something for me. Give me the cool costume. You were knitting me a sweater.
[9734.39s -> 9743.51s]  No, thank you. I can't. House of fun. Who am I? Who am I? House of fun. House of fun.
[9759.90s -> 9764.54s]  No, thank you. I can't eat anymore. I just tried to bark and it didn't do anything.
[9769.02s -> 9787.50s]  Good house. Jenga. Who are you? Who are you? House of fun. Hey you.
[9797.75s -> 9804.73s]  Hound dog. I saw him trying to bite off his own tail once. He was a sweet little puppy though.
[9804.73s -> 9840.98s]  All he needed was his doggy bone to make him happy. The suit... іi don't think i can get up
[9840.98s -> 9860.58s]  any higher. You know, it's easier to forget that the point of this game is picking up candy wrappers.
[9860.58s -> 9867.51s]  that's what i'm saying people give me shit for cleaning that's on the front cover of the box
[9868.23s -> 9875.26s]  i'm with a vacuum cleaner no it's not it's him carrying his plug on his head i don't know i
