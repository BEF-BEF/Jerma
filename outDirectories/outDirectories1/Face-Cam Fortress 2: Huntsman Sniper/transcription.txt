[0.82s -> 6.70s]  Hello everybody, Jerma here with a live commentary and a face cam video.
[6.90s -> 13.69s]  Because I know a lot of you guys were asking about this and I've never done this before. Let me take that back.
[13.69s -> 18.57s]  I have done this before on my live streams and I've done video blogs before, you know the deal.
[18.57s -> 25.36s]  But I figured why not just do this because I have a lot of time on my hands. So I set up this camera.
[25.40s -> 31.14s]  It's like duct taped on a pole sitting on the ground. It's just it gets ridiculous.
[31.30s -> 37.12s]  It actually took me like 25 minutes to set this up. So I was kind of raging about that.
[37.16s -> 40.01s]  But anyways, let's play some Huntsman Sniper.
[40.01s -> 46.38s]  This is on Shibby's server because my server is broken and doesn't work and I don't know if it ever will. Who knows?
[46.38s -> 50.78s]  I have no idea. Trying to fix that as of right now. I don't know.
[50.78s -> 58.94s]  So let's get started using the Huntsman, the Jurati and the what the hell am I using for a knife? The Tribalman Shiv.
[59.14s -> 65.79s]  Okay, so let's do it. See if I can't get some cool gameplay live even though that never happens.
[65.79s -> 74.26s]  This is on Nightfall. Payload Race Nightfall. A map that I've played probably three times in my life.
[74.26s -> 80.82s]  And I wish people would play it more because I guys I'm kind of getting sick of, you know, Dust Bowl, Badwater.
[81.02s -> 86.95s]  You know, they're getting kind of old. You know what needs to happen?
[87.19s -> 91.73s]  There's got to be an update for Team Fortress 2 because I'll tell you right now,
[92.65s -> 95.81s]  it's hard to find a server now that doesn't have bots in it.
[95.81s -> 101.46s]  The only servers that really aren't running bots anymore. I mean, this right now, it's 3.30 Eastern Time.
[101.46s -> 107.06s]  And every server I've tried to go to is just full of bots. And it's just like, what is going on?
[107.06s -> 112.18s]  There has to be some kind of update soon. Bring some more people into Team Fortress. Make people play.
[112.18s -> 118.32s]  I guess because of Skyrim and, you know, Modern Warfare 3 makes a little bit of sense.
[118.32s -> 126.62s]  So let's get this going. Out this window. Not in his head.
[126.62s -> 136.88s]  He's looking around for me. See that? He was like, oh, no, give me a kill. Hello.
[136.88s -> 142.20s]  I got the guy behind him. I shot at him and I got the guy behind him.
[142.20s -> 149.74s]  That didn't make any sense. Are we really? Wow. We're going to win this game that quick.
[149.74s -> 156.87s]  I can't wait to watch that back because I want to see what the hell even just happened right there.
[156.87s -> 163.07s]  Nobody on their card except this Pyro. No. One more second and I would have had him.
[163.07s -> 167.56s]  I'll have him right now though. Oh, that was close.
[167.56s -> 173.96s]  That was close. All right. I need some heals. I'm on fire, doctor.
[173.96s -> 180.65s]  No, it's a heavy coming around this corner. No, not a headshot.
[180.65s -> 190.62s]  Oh, my God. Two heavies. All right. Here we go. They're both dead.
[190.62s -> 202.33s]  Nice job, team. Push that cat. Oh, there we go. There we go.
[202.33s -> 207.82s]  Oh, this guy's got it out for me. Tribe him with Shiv. Tribe him with Shiv.
[207.82s -> 213.81s]  Oh, God. Cabot. Nice. That's one way to do it.
[213.81s -> 225.09s]  That's one way to do it. Get out the Shiv. Get out the Shiv and start smashing people.
[225.09s -> 233.12s]  I missed. Well, that went well for the first round. Let's do another one.
[233.12s -> 244.70s]  Get a sip of my water. That's right. I said water. W-A-T-A-H. Water.
[244.70s -> 251.28s]  Oh, I'm going to puke. I got to get out here, man. Jesus, what am I doing?
[251.28s -> 257.54s]  Oh, this guy's toast. Not high enough. Not too high.
[257.54s -> 261.10s]  It's been a... There it is. It's been a while since I've used the Huntsman.
[261.10s -> 272.07s]  So, there it is. Get out of my face, Scout. Oh, no. Get out of the car. Oh, God.
[272.07s -> 276.50s]  Got him right in his face. And there is a sniper shooting over here.
[276.50s -> 279.62s]  Oh, my God. No, that's not a sniper. That's a... Speaking of pyro.
[279.62s -> 285.70s]  I didn't even speak in a pyro when I talked. Oh, I need the Gerardi. Come on, come on, come on.
[285.70s -> 293.93s]  Did I get us both? Nice, I got us both. God, I need health. I'm going to get sniped
[293.93s -> 299.21s]  right in the face by a rocket. Oh, there it is. Come on. Heal me.
[299.21s -> 304.42s]  Get me up to at least like 70 or 80 before I go anywhere. That's good.
[304.42s -> 313.29s]  Oh, my God. No. It's all right. It's all right. We're good. Get on the car so I can heal.
[313.29s -> 318.47s]  I knew it. I knew you were a spy. We got anybody? We got a medic?
[318.47s -> 329.72s]  We do not have a medic. Get this guy right here. Bang. Get this guy right here, too.
[330.36s -> 338.58s]  Get down. Get down. Come on. Let's go, cot. Let's go. That's a spy. Spy. Oh, we got it.
[338.58s -> 346.38s]  I got it. Get out of here. Get out of here. This thing is so weak. We did it. Oh, man.
[348.95s -> 352.15s]  All right. Well, thank you, everybody, so much for watching. I really appreciate it.
[352.15s -> 355.67s]  And I'm going to drink the rest of this water on camera. I'm going to chug the water. Here we go.
[355.67s -> 367.05s]  Ready? One, two, three. I can't do it. I'm going to puke. Puke is going to come out of my mouth.
[369.11s -> 371.83s]  No, but thanks, everybody, for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[371.83s -> 375.19s]  And I'll see you guys all next time. Take care, everybody.
