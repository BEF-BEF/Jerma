[1.27s -> 4.23s]  Sorry dude, I forgot to press the button that says to talk.
[5.75s -> 11.50s]  No, I know. I can't even have two minutes. I can't even have two minutes to myself.
[11.50s -> 17.99s]  Oh, I can't have two minutes to myself. I turn the stream on and I'm just sitting here,
[17.99s -> 27.40s]  just looking at Spongebob. This is our time. You had a whole day to yourself.
[29.78s -> 37.99s]  You're ours now. His mic is wicked fucked up. I tried to fix it. I tried to make it louder.
[37.99s -> 50.38s]  Did I not succeed in making the mic louder? Am I loud now?
[50.46s -> 56.44s]  You had two months to yourself, Omega Lul.
[60.25s -> 66.06s]  And do that again. That's how you know I'm at 61%.
[66.70s -> 72.58s]  Oh, we shouldn't do that though. We have to take another fucking three months off.
[73.14s -> 82.81s]  That's your- that's how you prove it. That's how you tell people that you're feeling a little
[82.81s -> 88.38s]  better. It's the amount of times that you can- how many octaves and you can go up or down.
[88.38s -> 95.16s]  Fucking idiot. All right, we're gonna play Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated.
[97.16s -> 102.82s]  I was gonna play the original on the PS3, PS2, but months and months and months ago,
[103.46s -> 109.30s]  I was told, don't do that. They're making a new one. They're redoing the whole game. Just wait.
[109.30s -> 118.76s]  So I just waited and here it is. I've never played this. I'm a huge fan of Spongebob. I've seen
[120.36s -> 128.28s]  like the first 12 episodes and then I just stopped. I'm a huge fan. That's not even fucking true.
[132.66s -> 140.58s]  I think I've seen all the Spongebob episodes up until, I don't know, like maybe after the fourth,
[140.58s -> 147.29s]  sixth season? Season seven? How many actual new episodes- hit the thing about Spongebob
[147.29s -> 152.01s]  that's hard for me to understand. So does Spongebob keep having new episodes or do they keep
[152.89s -> 162.63s]  replaying old ones? Sometimes it's hard to tell. There's 13 seasons. Seasons one through three are
[162.63s -> 169.37s]  the good ones. Yeah, I know, but I can't- I'm not gonna lie to you. I've definitely laughed.
[170.01s -> 175.21s]  Like giggled at like probably like season eight, like episode 10, you know? I have.
[175.85s -> 182.42s]  Yeah, they made a movie too. All right, let me tweet this. Give me one second.
[199.66s -> 205.88s]  I'm just- hold on. Just on my Twitter. This is the first thing that's on my list.
[207.70s -> 215.19s]  Okay, this is- this is a render of me singing this song in the game. Why is this the first
[215.19s -> 235.98s]  thing in my feed? All right, well that was cool. All right, let me tweet this. This is freaking me
[235.98s -> 243.98s]  out. Why is it such- why is it so good? That's me doing that, but it's a render of me on another
[243.98s -> 251.72s]  character. Was I deepfaked onto a video game character? You can do that? You can be deepfaked
[251.72s -> 257.42s]  onto a new- a video game? I thought it had to be like a human face, like a photo or something,
[257.42s -> 264.44s]  or like an actual video of a person. Holy sh- all right, hit this star. Let me tweet this.
[265.08s -> 270.26s]  In the meantime, you guys can take a look at Spongebob doing the fucking gerbil walk.
[276.15s -> 282.49s]  That's what he's doing, right? All right, give me one second. Spongebob. People probably think
[282.49s -> 287.77s]  I'm watching Spongebob. What if I wrote, watching favorite Spongebob episodes? And then like,
[288.49s -> 293.99s]  he doesn't know. I'm gonna wake it fucked up mood today. This is gonna be a weird one.
[294.63s -> 311.64s]  I can already tell. No, not Jerma975. Who the fuck is that? All right, can I- why would you make that
[311.64s -> 322.97s]  name? Are you gonna start a streaming career as like Jerma785? Like, I'm Jerma985. Are you gonna be
[322.97s -> 335.61s]  Jerma895? What do you think's gonna happen? I'm the only Jerma985. I'm the only Jerma with any
[335.61s -> 351.67s]  three series of numbers after his name. All right, let's go. Do we even have a controller? Yeah,
[351.67s -> 359.50s]  I do. So is this game any good? Is this actually like a fun game? Here's where I'm concerned. Is
[359.50s -> 370.41s]  this a Simpsons hit and run kind of game? No. Okay, well, let's check it out. I'm ready.
[379.85s -> 380.97s]  It's like its own episode.
[398.14s -> 399.26s]  I think he's gonna do it this time.
[405.10s -> 406.78s]  With my brand-new
[409.42s -> 409.98s]  I'm available.
[417.59s -> 425.19s]  One last review of the checklist. Let's see. Item number one is Plankton, a genius.
[425.19s -> 431.03s]  And sir, yes, okay checklist complete. Throwing the switch. I think that's just a game.
[431.03s -> 439.03s]  Welcome my perfectly obedient robot army. Hang on. I want to get a photo for my scrap.
[439.03s -> 443.27s]  What do you mean no? Hey, hello. What do you think you're doing?
[448.20s -> 453.58s]  I'm seeing that in real time too. Wait, I'm your manager.
[456.06s -> 470.60s]  That's not you seeing that on stream. I'm seeing that too. Another perfect day playing robots
[470.60s -> 476.36s]  and racehorses. Yeah, only I keep getting the racehorses and the robots mixed up.
[476.36s -> 481.86s]  Wait, do I have like the Spanish animation and the English dub? Do I have this wrong?
[486.50s -> 491.70s]  These unreal robots are getting boring. Hey, what if we put robots in here?
[491.70s -> 494.82s]  No, this is right. Oh, how shellfish of you.
[497.42s -> 498.86s]  I won't do it. I'm not gonna do it.
[504.38s -> 508.78s]  Great, Patrick. So we put the toy robots in here.
[508.78s -> 516.18s]  Yeah, it's fine. I didn't even do it. Why is everybody minus? I didn't do anything.
[516.18s -> 520.02s]  I told you I wasn't going to do it because I didn't want to offend everybody in this room.
[520.74s -> 524.58s]  It's quite a big room. Shut up. All right. Oh my god.
[524.58s -> 529.02s]  Patrick, are you going to say the magic wishing words?
[529.02s -> 534.46s]  You already did. Magic wishing word?
[534.46s -> 543.26s]  It used to be, but I kept forgetting it. Are you sure this will work?
[543.98s -> 550.70s]  Sure. Last week, I only had one big cookie crumb and I was really hungry. So I put my
[550.70s -> 556.30s]  cookie crumb in the magic wishing shell. Is this like Patrick accidentally makes meth?
[556.30s -> 564.14s]  What is this episode? Patrick, I proclaim that tomorrow is going to be the best day ever.
[564.86s -> 566.94s]  Good night, SpongeBob. Good night, Patrick.
[568.78s -> 569.82s]  The next melding.
[581.77s -> 584.65s]  Is this blood? The bikini bottom stinks.
[589.62s -> 593.46s]  Yeah, Gary. It sure looks like we're in a doozy of a pickle.
[593.62s -> 600.42s]  What in the world is going on? Did Patrick breathe in the shit in the shell and go in
[600.42s -> 611.35s]  like a drug craze and destroy the place? That is what happened. Is that actually what happened?
[612.23s -> 615.11s]  Why are people saying that's what happened? Yes, Jeremy, that's what happened.
[620.60s -> 626.33s]  That's not what happened. I think I can't just read this normally.
[627.85s -> 631.37s]  I can't. All right. Everybody fucking leave if you don't like it. Whatever. I don't care.
[631.93s -> 636.47s]  I think I'm going to have to learn a lot in order to fix this mess.
[639.78s -> 642.10s]  What a fantastic idea. Oh, he already read it.
[642.10s -> 645.30s]  These signs will provide important tips to help me out.
[645.30s -> 650.84s]  He already read it. Why did I read it after?
[652.95s -> 657.83s]  Why did I not process that he's the whole thing is voice acted? What am I stupid?
[657.83s -> 671.24s]  OK. How do I read the signs? Press this to read the signs.
[671.24s -> 673.16s]  Right bumper to read the signs. You got it.
[675.03s -> 679.51s]  So if I want to come back and talk to you again, just walk up to you and press this button.
[680.15s -> 684.79s]  I'd better get started now, Gary. I think that this is going to be a very long day.
[685.77s -> 691.94s]  OK, so you talk with Arby, explore the kitchen with all this stuff,
[691.94s -> 695.54s]  explore the bedroom and explore the attic. Explore the closet.
[698.30s -> 703.62s]  Pretty fluid. This actually looks really good.
[709.43s -> 714.41s]  This is really, really nice looking, isn't it? OK, let's explore.
[714.41s -> 721.66s]  We need 50 whatever those are. These are shiny objects.
[721.66s -> 724.70s]  Shiny objects are very valuable and may be traded to help SpongeBob a lot.
[724.70s -> 729.18s]  This is a currency. SpongeBob will need to collect as many shiny objects in order to complete his
[729.18s -> 733.66s]  quest to defeat the robot menace. There are five different hundred.
[733.66s -> 737.74s]  There are a hundred different community subs that just came in from Freddy Dredd.
[738.70s -> 742.06s]  Another of like added to the thousands that Freddy Dredd has given.
[742.06s -> 745.34s]  It's a fucking insane. Thank you for the hundred community stuff.
[747.02s -> 754.70s]  He's ready there. Thank you, Freddy. Jesus.
[755.34s -> 758.70s]  Ready again. Ready every day. Ready every moment.
[761.75s -> 765.43s]  I need to open up my like Twitch analytics and look at like total amount of money
[765.43s -> 768.39s]  contributions and just see, oh, here's the percent from Freddy.
[768.95s -> 772.63s]  It's like probably like it's probably like 13 percent by now, 20 percent.
[775.74s -> 776.78s]  Thank you, dude. Seriously.
[779.45s -> 782.09s]  Anyways, there are five colors. It's him.
[783.67s -> 786.39s]  Ready. Yeah, Freddy Dredd. I don't know who the fuck that is.
[788.92s -> 793.50s]  Hey, go look them up. There are five different colors.
[793.50s -> 797.58s]  Red, yellow, green, blue and purple. There are five different colors.
[797.58s -> 805.59s]  OK, red, yellow, green, camera TV. You know, I need to do it again.
[806.55s -> 808.55s]  Red is the most common and the least valuable.
[809.11s -> 811.67s]  Purple is the most rare and therefore the most valuable.
[812.47s -> 815.93s]  We'll value the shiny objects on her. OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[815.93s -> 822.65s]  Oh, get over it. I was what? What's wrong?
[822.65s -> 823.93s]  You know, I can't do that.
[826.17s -> 828.70s]  And it even smells sweaty.
[828.70s -> 831.58s]  Just like I said, I said the words camera and TV.
[831.58s -> 834.78s]  All right. What? I can't say camera and TV in the same sentence.
[834.78s -> 836.14s]  But there's five things to remember.
[836.86s -> 843.24s]  I know from Mr. Krabs, it even smells sweaty.
[843.24s -> 844.92s]  That's gross. How the fuck does that happen?
[844.92s -> 846.28s]  Ahoy there, SpongeBob.
[846.28s -> 846.92s]  That's disgusting.
[846.92s -> 854.76s]  As a faithful crew member of the Krusty Krab, you've been promoted to head shiny object collector.
[854.76s -> 859.24s]  Yeah, that's a different actor.
[859.24s -> 860.76s]  Is it wasn't available?
[864.95s -> 866.39s]  That's right. A promotion.
[866.95s -> 871.91s]  So what this here new job entails is you collecting all these shiny objects.
[871.91s -> 874.63s]  He's probably leaving behind and bringing them to me.
[875.27s -> 877.83s]  Now, stop seahorsing around and get busy collecting.
[880.94s -> 883.02s]  That's right. No, I'm not going to try.
[883.02s -> 884.46s]  I need like another year to figure that out.
[885.10s -> 886.97s]  The robots of the area.
[894.14s -> 896.65s]  I love this. This is so fun.
[896.65s -> 897.69s]  I haven't done anything.
[898.25s -> 899.93s]  All right. So let me see the rarity.
[902.01s -> 903.53s]  Red, yellow, green, blue, purple.
[904.17s -> 905.13s]  Red is the most common.
[906.23s -> 907.51s]  Purple is the most valuable.
[907.51s -> 908.71s]  So that's what I'm looking for is purple.
[909.27s -> 917.03s]  You better do SpongeBob voices.
[918.42s -> 920.10s]  Do you really think you were going to come to the screen
[920.10s -> 921.86s]  and you're not going to hear at least four times?
[922.58s -> 923.54s]  It's already happened twice.
[924.26s -> 925.10s]  I don't know.
[925.10s -> 927.90s]  I thought that you said SpongeBob can see through walls.
[927.90s -> 929.42s]  SpongeBob, we see through walls.
[929.42s -> 932.06s]  I was like, wait, how is Hitman?
[932.86s -> 933.59s]  All right.
[933.59s -> 935.03s]  SpongeBob, I see how well he's doing.
[935.03s -> 938.23s]  But pressing RT, Zixie, a hundred community subs.
[938.23s -> 941.11s]  You guys, it took two fucking streams.
[941.83s -> 946.15s]  With like 3000 subs to get just jumped, dumped back on here.
[946.15s -> 947.11s]  I can't even fucking believe it.
[949.51s -> 951.19s]  Thank you. It's insane to me.
[951.19s -> 953.75s]  It's insane that you guys would even remotely
[953.75s -> 955.67s]  like have that many people come back and sub it
[955.67s -> 956.47s]  or community sub.
[956.47s -> 957.19s]  It's crazy.
[957.19s -> 957.99s]  I can't even believe it.
[958.95s -> 963.19s]  SpongeBob, we see how well he's doing by pressing RT.
[963.19s -> 963.91s]  Thank you, Zixie.
[963.91s -> 966.39s]  Seriously, so many people gave money last time.
[966.39s -> 968.55s]  I was just kind of overwhelmed and trying to ease back into it.
[969.27s -> 972.31s]  And if you don't know, I'm no longer doing bit readings.
[973.27s -> 974.23s]  It's a whole thing.
[974.87s -> 976.63s]  I'll go over it again later on.
[976.63s -> 977.99s]  We'll talk about it again if you don't know.
[978.95s -> 981.26s]  The upright is how many shiny objects you have.
[981.26s -> 982.30s]  Is it like a currency?
[982.30s -> 982.86s]  Don't say that.
[982.86s -> 984.22s]  That's an easy joke.
[985.34s -> 987.29s]  Golden spatulas.
[987.29s -> 989.77s]  Is this kind of like puzzle pieces in Banjo?
[989.77s -> 991.45s]  Like Stars in Mario?
[991.45s -> 993.50s]  Patrick's Lost Socks.
[994.38s -> 996.87s]  Here's an underwear SpongeBob has.
[998.94s -> 999.50s]  Cool. All right.
[1000.22s -> 1002.12s]  Okay.
[1002.12s -> 1003.72s]  I make myself a snack.
[1003.72s -> 1008.18s]  SpongeBob, there's snacks.
[1008.18s -> 1008.42s]  All right.
[1009.22s -> 1010.74s]  What's the last room I have to go into?
[1010.74s -> 1011.78s]  I need more shiny objects.
[1011.78s -> 1016.12s]  Oh, I can put the camera in this bathroom.
[1016.84s -> 1017.24s]  The attic.
[1017.24s -> 1018.04s]  How do I get to the attic?
[1018.76s -> 1022.42s]  I'm blind.
[1022.42s -> 1022.74s]  Hold on.
[1022.74s -> 1024.18s]  I got to get all the shiny objects.
[1026.15s -> 1027.19s]  There's a double jump.
[1027.19s -> 1028.95s]  This game just became 10 times more cool.
[1033.08s -> 1033.80s]  I don't want to miss these.
[1034.44s -> 1040.65s]  This is a classic collectathon.
[1040.65s -> 1042.09s]  Oh, don't get me in this one.
[1042.89s -> 1044.87s]  I don't think I'll ever get out.
[1045.59s -> 1046.58s]  Wait, what is this?
[1048.06s -> 1048.70s]  Oh, whoa.
[1049.50s -> 1050.65s]  Oh, I see.
[1050.65s -> 1050.89s]  All right.
[1050.89s -> 1051.53s]  This is the bedroom.
[1052.33s -> 1055.67s]  I thought of.
[1056.07s -> 1056.31s]  All right.
[1056.31s -> 1056.87s]  Here's underwear.
[1057.43s -> 1058.07s]  How do I pick it up?
[1060.71s -> 1061.91s]  What is underwear health?
[1062.63s -> 1069.24s]  Can I open this?
[1069.24s -> 1069.64s]  It is.
[1069.64s -> 1069.96s]  Wow.
[1071.82s -> 1072.38s]  AA.
[1073.58s -> 1074.54s]  Double jump for extra height.
[1074.54s -> 1076.22s]  SpongeBob can only double jump once per jump.
[1082.28s -> 1082.68s]  Is there any?
[1084.36s -> 1085.72s]  I was going to call them crusties.
[1086.44s -> 1090.22s]  Oh, shit.
[1090.22s -> 1091.50s]  There's a lot of tutorials in here.
[1092.30s -> 1094.22s]  See how well SpongeBob is doing in every level of the game.
[1094.22s -> 1094.46s]  Press.
[1096.06s -> 1097.18s]  No, I got.
[1097.18s -> 1099.19s]  What the fuck, Xbox?
[1099.19s -> 1100.87s]  Like, what ever happened to the original start?
[1100.87s -> 1102.71s]  What's with the fucking menu button thing?
[1102.71s -> 1104.31s]  Like, I always forget where that is.
[1104.31s -> 1106.47s]  I always forget if it's selector start.
[1108.22s -> 1111.10s]  It's been the same thing for like 20, 30 straight years.
[1111.10s -> 1113.50s]  And you had to just put the weird like top left.
[1114.30s -> 1116.38s]  iPad friendly menu button.
[1116.38s -> 1117.50s]  That's on every website.
[1118.06s -> 1119.18s]  Like, just make it the start button.
[1119.18s -> 1119.58s]  Well, who?
[1119.58s -> 1120.22s]  Why change that?
[1120.22s -> 1120.70s]  I don't understand.
[1120.70s -> 1121.10s]  I don't get it.
[1121.90s -> 1125.74s]  I always forget if that's selector start.
[1125.74s -> 1128.90s]  When a level is selected, press A to view its details.
[1128.90s -> 1130.42s]  So, okay, you can see how much you've collected.
[1133.99s -> 1134.55s]  Yeah.
[1134.55s -> 1136.54s]  There's a hint on each golden spatula.
[1137.02s -> 1138.14s]  Hmm.
[1138.14s -> 1142.63s]  SpongeBob can take a taxi directly to the area of that spatula
[1142.63s -> 1144.07s]  from anywhere in the game.
[1144.07s -> 1144.55s]  Holy shit.
[1144.55s -> 1145.19s]  That's so good.
[1145.91s -> 1149.54s]  How many areas are in this game?
[1150.26s -> 1153.06s]  SpongeBob's.
[1154.50s -> 1156.26s]  Wait, did I just take a taxi to my closet?
[1156.90s -> 1165.50s]  Press Y when the ground, when on the ground,
[1165.50s -> 1166.94s]  and SpongeBob will do a bubble bash.
[1167.58s -> 1170.71s]  The bubble bash can smash tiki's or robots
[1170.71s -> 1172.87s]  or push buttons that are directly above SpongeBob.
[1173.75s -> 1178.55s]  When you see this icon, SpongeBob can stand on it
[1178.55s -> 1180.31s]  and do the bubble bash to break this directly above him.
[1180.31s -> 1180.79s]  Okay, cool.
[1181.75s -> 1183.11s]  I was going to say, what the hell does that mean?
[1186.04s -> 1187.16s]  I, I get a beach ball.
[1188.12s -> 1190.20s]  Oh, cool.
[1190.20s -> 1192.62s]  I haven't even played the game yet and it just happened fun.
[1192.62s -> 1193.18s]  This is fun.
[1193.90s -> 1196.02s]  Can I run on it?
[1196.58s -> 1198.89s]  I've got to believe I can run on it.
[1199.77s -> 1207.03s]  What do the tiki's do?
[1209.34s -> 1212.54s]  Just extra, uh, I got to think of something to call these
[1212.54s -> 1213.58s]  because I'll, I'll forget it every time.
[1214.14s -> 1218.33s]  Press B and he'll do a bubble bounce attack.
[1218.33s -> 1223.88s]  Okay, that's just like a grandpa.
[1225.00s -> 1228.65s]  Yeah, B.
[1230.09s -> 1230.57s]  Rampoline.
[1231.45s -> 1234.14s]  Okay, cool.
[1235.26s -> 1237.99s]  So what does the attack button do?
[1237.99s -> 1238.87s]  Can I just catch stuff?
[1245.26s -> 1247.96s]  This is going to turn into like Luigi's Mansion
[1247.96s -> 1250.28s]  where I told you I couldn't play Luigi's Mansion 3 on stream.
[1251.24s -> 1252.20s]  You guys know why, right?
[1254.92s -> 1256.52s]  Oh, here's the bubble spin.
[1256.52s -> 1257.00s]  Okay.
[1257.00s -> 1263.30s]  It was asking me why because I couldn't,
[1263.30s -> 1265.78s]  I had to suck up every single object in every room.
[1266.58s -> 1267.78s]  I just, I couldn't even play it.
[1267.78s -> 1268.74s]  I had to stop playing it.
[1269.70s -> 1272.34s]  I got to like the first little boss encounter
[1272.34s -> 1275.06s]  and it was like three or four hours had gone by
[1275.06s -> 1276.26s]  and I'm just like, I have to stop this.
[1276.26s -> 1277.06s]  I have to stop playing this.
[1277.06s -> 1278.10s]  It's driving me crazy.
[1279.94s -> 1280.50s]  Oh, let me see.
[1281.72s -> 1282.44s]  Okay, right.
[1282.44s -> 1285.00s]  Oh, you can push buttons on walls.
[1286.52s -> 1288.68s]  Why was I pretending that I, that was new information?
[1290.36s -> 1291.72s]  Okay, you can jump, do an emitter.
[1292.44s -> 1297.40s]  All right, cool.
[1297.96s -> 1301.43s]  But yeah, if I have to just collect every single item.
[1302.23s -> 1305.43s]  Wait, now I, oh man, this is not going to,
[1305.43s -> 1306.47s]  this is not going to go well.
[1307.35s -> 1310.23s]  I'm going to be stuck here for the life.
[1317.35s -> 1317.83s]  Shit.
[1317.83s -> 1319.27s]  Okay, I got to get that dirty sock.
[1319.91s -> 1321.66s]  Give me that beach ball.
[1322.30s -> 1337.61s]  Hey, what the hell was that?
[1337.61s -> 1338.57s]  I need to get that.
[1339.13s -> 1342.42s]  Wait, can I just push it?
[1342.42s -> 1349.19s]  Why am I trying to?
[1350.73s -> 1354.01s]  Oh, here comes some hustle platforming.
[1355.18s -> 1357.02s]  25 seconds left.
[1357.02s -> 1358.30s]  23 seconds left.
[1358.30s -> 1359.90s]  22, 21.
[1359.90s -> 1361.18s]  No, do they get a head start?
[1363.03s -> 1364.07s]  What the fuck?
[1364.07s -> 1378.90s]  I thought I was looking at, yeah.
[1378.90s -> 1380.58s]  I hate that I wasn't going to get there.
[1383.30s -> 1387.50s]  And that's one dirty sock.
[1389.42s -> 1390.14s]  Room complete.
[1390.78s -> 1397.54s]  Yeah, you can take a 10 second head start.
[1397.54s -> 1398.34s]  That's fine.
[1398.34s -> 1404.66s]  All right, now it's 50 to go in there.
[1405.46s -> 1407.38s]  I have 50, right?
[1407.38s -> 1407.62s]  Yeah.
[1407.62s -> 1408.18s]  All right, let's go.
[1408.18s -> 1409.14s]  This room is expensive.
[1411.72s -> 1413.64s]  Ooh, there's a golden spatula.
[1414.36s -> 1418.49s]  What about the legendary chest?
[1418.49s -> 1419.37s]  Hold on.
[1419.37s -> 1421.13s]  This is a golden spatula.
[1421.85s -> 1423.93s]  They're needed to unlock new areas of Bikini Bottom.
[1423.93s -> 1426.33s]  SpongeBob will need to collect many golden spatulas.
[1427.37s -> 1428.12s]  Okay.
[1429.26s -> 1436.07s]  Ooh, go back and look at the chest somebody said.
[1436.07s -> 1437.75s]  Maybe a little bounce on the old bed.
[1438.79s -> 1440.15s]  Read the sign next to the chest.
[1440.15s -> 1440.63s]  Wait, what?
[1442.70s -> 1443.82s]  This is underwear.
[1444.38s -> 1448.90s]  To lose a pair of underwear every time he gets hit by a robot or touches dangerous objects.
[1448.90s -> 1449.38s]  Like this.
[1451.16s -> 1454.44s]  When he's lost all of his underwear, he must start that area back over again.
[1456.34s -> 1456.66s]  Yes.
[1458.50s -> 1463.22s]  SpongeBob may get back underwear he has lost by collecting additional pairs along the way.
[1463.94s -> 1466.26s]  SpongeBob starts out wearing three pairs of underwear,
[1466.26s -> 1469.30s]  but there are special pairs of golden underwear hidden in Bikini Bottom.
[1469.78s -> 1473.86s]  Which if you find them, they'll allow SpongeBob to wear more than three pairs of underwear at a time.
[1475.96s -> 1476.46s]  Ugh.
[1477.08s -> 1480.41s]  SpongeBob can check how many pairs of underwear he has on.
[1481.13s -> 1482.17s]  Pressing right trigger.
[1487.53s -> 1490.98s]  SpongeBob has no underwear on.
[1493.08s -> 1493.88s]  All right, let's go.
[1493.88s -> 1495.00s]  I got the spatula.
[1495.00s -> 1496.36s]  Look, I'm not looking for 100%.
[1496.36s -> 1498.12s]  I'm just looking for like somewhere around 80.
[1501.30s -> 1501.80s]  TV.
[1513.11s -> 1514.07s]  Quietly.
[1514.07s -> 1514.57s]  Yeah.
[1538.30s -> 1539.68s]  Oh no.
[1540.46s -> 1541.34s]  I'm in big trouble.
[1542.14s -> 1549.30s]  This is a plus two game.
[1550.10s -> 1551.06s]  Yeah, it's SpongeBob.
[1551.06s -> 1554.02s]  There's nothing like the sounds of your own neighborhood.
[1554.74s -> 1556.57s]  Oh shit.
[1556.57s -> 1557.21s]  Open world.
[1557.21s -> 1558.25s]  Go away, SpongeBob.
[1558.25s -> 1559.93s]  You're polluting my thinking space.
[1560.97s -> 1564.73s]  Trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula again, eh, Plankton?
[1564.73s -> 1566.17s]  Well, you won't get away with it.
[1567.51s -> 1569.19s]  I've got bigger fish to fry.
[1569.19s -> 1573.11s]  I've got to figure out how to regain control of the chum bucket from those robots.
[1573.99s -> 1574.49s]  Crush him.
[1581.18s -> 1582.14s]  Not for me, though.
[1582.14s -> 1583.34s]  That's for sure.
[1583.34s -> 1586.62s]  They just showed up out of nowhere and started calling me rude names
[1586.62s -> 1587.66s]  and throwing things.
[1589.10s -> 1591.34s]  They even bent all my spoons.
[1592.06s -> 1594.86s]  I love those spoons like they were my children.
[1595.58s -> 1596.70s]  He's a liar.
[1596.70s -> 1597.18s]  He did it.
[1597.18s -> 1597.98s]  That's terrible.
[1597.98s -> 1598.70s]  It was him.
[1598.70s -> 1599.34s]  I know it.
[1599.98s -> 1601.42s]  It's him in every episode.
[1601.42s -> 1606.06s]  Oh, won't you help me stop them before they bend all my forks?
[1607.02s -> 1613.51s]  But wait, I'm supposed to collect a whole lot of golden spatulas.
[1613.51s -> 1616.07s]  Golden spatulas, SpongeBob?
[1616.07s -> 1618.39s]  That sounds like something I'd be interested in.
[1619.03s -> 1620.63s]  Golden spatulas, eh?
[1621.35s -> 1624.15s]  SpongeBob, if you could get me back into the chum bucket,
[1624.15s -> 1628.23s]  I'll give you a bucket full of golden spatulas in your dreams.
[1630.89s -> 1631.93s]  You've got a deal.
[1637.21s -> 1637.71s]  Stop it!
[1638.25s -> 1642.49s]  Oh, god, that was fucking so funny, Jerma.
[1642.49s -> 1643.93s]  I laughed wicked fucking hard.
[1643.93s -> 1646.01s]  I love opening presents.
[1646.01s -> 1647.53s]  All right, so taxi.
[1647.53s -> 1649.69s]  So let's, can I just go anywhere?
[1650.57s -> 1654.28s]  Any five to go this way.
[1654.28s -> 1657.74s]  Need more golden spatulas to unlock downtown Bikini Bottom.
[1658.70s -> 1668.54s]  All right, should I just do what happens in every SpongeBob episode?
[1669.88s -> 1671.80s]  Like throw rocks at Squidward's house?
[1672.36s -> 1676.33s]  Where are they?
[1676.33s -> 1682.81s]  SpongeBob, this flapping robot crisis is making
[1682.81s -> 1684.97s]  the Krusty Krab lose money like a sinking ship.
[1685.69s -> 1687.93s]  No money means no more Krusty Krab.
[1688.57s -> 1691.77s]  No more Krusty Krab means no more fry cooking for you.
[1692.81s -> 1695.21s]  It's imitation crabs.
[1695.21s -> 1696.25s]  Imitation crab.
[1696.25s -> 1697.45s]  Ah, that was pretty good.
[1698.41s -> 1699.21s]  That was pretty good.
[1704.74s -> 1707.62s]  But because you're gullible, I'm going to help you out.
[1707.62s -> 1709.54s]  And of course, make a small profit in return.
[1710.42s -> 1713.70s]  I've got a few golden spatulas that I'll be willing to trade to you
[1713.70s -> 1715.30s]  for some of those shiny objects.
[1716.90s -> 1720.50s]  But because you're gullible, I'm going to help you out, boy.
[1720.50s -> 1722.26s]  And of course, make a small profit.
[1722.26s -> 1724.74s]  It's, his voice is un, you can't mimic it.
[1724.74s -> 1725.24s]  You can't.
[1727.32s -> 1728.52s]  Alex Jones.
[1729.32s -> 1741.11s]  I got a few golden spatulas that will be willing to trade you
[1741.11s -> 1742.55s]  for some of those shiny objects and...
[1743.51s -> 1747.00s]  Ah, Spongebob, I just, where's the problem?
[1747.00s -> 1747.80s]  The problem is you just...
[1748.84s -> 1750.04s]  I'm not getting any more money on this,
[1750.04s -> 1751.56s]  and I got to make money to make money, you know what I mean?
[1752.20s -> 1762.25s]  I mean, but don't you think that Alex Jones
[1762.25s -> 1763.61s]  would be able to do a better Mr. Krabs?
[1764.33s -> 1766.09s]  Like if it was just Alex Jones talking,
[1766.09s -> 1767.21s]  it would be closer, wouldn't it?
[1767.93s -> 1774.30s]  Hey, Spongebob, I just dropped by to give you a bubble hand.
[1774.30s -> 1774.80s]  No.
[1781.35s -> 1783.11s]  If Alex Jones, yes, somebody said it.
[1783.11s -> 1785.59s]  If Alex Jones did his best pirate impression,
[1786.23s -> 1788.17s]  it might be kind of close.
[1788.17s -> 1788.81s]  It could be.
[1790.38s -> 1793.98s]  Wait, what you've never heard, Alex Jones, is Mr. Krabs impression?
[1793.98s -> 1794.70s]  Neither have I.
[1795.94s -> 1799.38s]  You see, you're going to need to learn some new bubble blowing moves
[1799.38s -> 1801.62s]  if you're going to journey to the ninth dimension
[1801.62s -> 1803.78s]  and defeat the giant monkey man.
[1804.42s -> 1812.33s]  You see, you're going to need to learn some new bubble blowing moves.
[1813.43s -> 1816.89s]  But, uh, all I need to do is figure out how to get rid of these robots.
[1819.05s -> 1819.77s]  You really want...
[1832.76s -> 1833.96s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[1834.68s -> 1836.60s]  I'm, all right, now you're throwing me off.
[1838.14s -> 1839.42s]  Oh, yeah, sorry.
[1840.06s -> 1842.22s]  I've been in the soap bottle a little too long.
[1843.02s -> 1843.66s]  Where were we?
[1844.62s -> 1848.30s]  That's something about new bubble moves.
[1848.30s -> 1849.26s]  I'm not on crack.
[1851.35s -> 1851.75s]  All right.
[1852.39s -> 1853.11s]  Right.
[1853.11s -> 1854.07s]  Press this button.
[1854.07s -> 1856.95s]  I'm on a different, I'm on a different drug.
[1856.95s -> 1859.99s]  That defeats anything that is directly above you.
[1859.99s -> 1860.71s]  Try it out.
[1861.51s -> 1861.99s]  I already know.
[1862.79s -> 1864.15s]  The sign told me this already.
[1869.82s -> 1871.18s]  It shines.
[1871.99s -> 1872.95s]  Mega combo?
[1872.95s -> 1873.83s]  Wait, why is this attacking me?
[1874.87s -> 1877.86s]  It's on absent.
[1877.86s -> 1882.02s]  Don't forget to defeat robots or tiggies that are directly above you.
[1882.02s -> 1882.98s]  Press this button.
[1883.54s -> 1884.34s]  Did I try this one?
[1886.06s -> 1886.54s]  No.
[1886.54s -> 1892.36s]  What about the robot parts?
[1892.36s -> 1893.00s]  Anything with those?
[1893.64s -> 1907.62s]  Hey, hey.
[1907.62s -> 1917.43s]  Oh, that just, okay, that freaked me the fuck out.
[1918.98s -> 1921.54s]  That was so out of place that I thought something was wrong.
[1922.42s -> 1927.14s]  I don't know why.
[1927.70s -> 1931.94s]  That was so out of place that I felt like somebody was in the room with me here
[1931.94s -> 1933.30s]  and did that from behind the monitor.
[1934.02s -> 1938.55s]  All right, so where do I go?
[1938.55s -> 1939.59s]  Where should I go?
[1939.59s -> 1940.87s]  Should I go to Squidward's house?
[1945.37s -> 1946.49s]  Ooh, golden undies.
[1956.78s -> 1957.50s]  Shit, what did that do?
[1958.06s -> 1961.14s]  How do I get there?
[1961.14s -> 1963.38s]  On this side?
[1963.38s -> 1970.12s]  Wait, no.
[1970.68s -> 1975.48s]  Hurry up.
[1975.48s -> 1985.91s]  Oh, got one.
[1987.34s -> 1988.22s]  Two spatulas.
[1993.98s -> 1995.34s]  All right, so I need five to go that way.
[1995.34s -> 1997.90s]  So let's go to, let's go to Squidward's house.
[2005.00s -> 2009.40s]  Those stupid robots ruined a perfectly relaxing mud bath this morning.
[2009.40s -> 2010.92s]  And now you show up.
[2010.92s -> 2013.40s]  Can my day get any more dreary?
[2013.96s -> 2016.84s]  Yeah, let's like annoy Squidward.
[2017.56s -> 2020.38s]  I am so sorry, Squidward.
[2020.38s -> 2022.46s]  Patrick and I were just playing a game and-
[2022.46s -> 2025.16s]  I correct myself.
[2025.16s -> 2026.84s]  Oh, I correct myself.
[2026.84s -> 2030.12s]  That whole robot problem involved both of you.
[2030.12s -> 2031.24s]  This whole stream is going to be that.
[2031.24s -> 2033.16s]  And I'm sorry, there's like 8,000 people here.
[2033.16s -> 2035.48s]  And I think a lot of you might not have been to the stream maybe before.
[2036.76s -> 2037.40s]  That's what this is.
[2037.40s -> 2038.12s]  That's the whole thing.
[2039.48s -> 2040.28s]  I don't know either.
[2040.28s -> 2041.40s]  I know what you just said out loud.
[2041.40s -> 2042.76s]  I don't know how I got here either.
[2043.56s -> 2044.20s]  I don't.
[2045.82s -> 2046.38s]  Let's move on.
[2047.02s -> 2053.30s]  Squidward, I don't know what to do.
[2053.30s -> 2055.22s]  How can I fix everything?
[2055.22s -> 2057.40s]  One picture on the wall.
[2057.40s -> 2061.98s]  That should help out more than enough to another town.
[2064.17s -> 2065.61s]  Guys, what are you talking about?
[2065.61s -> 2070.25s]  That's just every iPhone selfie when you turn the forward-facing camera to you.
[2070.89s -> 2077.61s]  I didn't know Squidward had a lamp.
[2077.61s -> 2083.02s]  Let's get all this stuff.
[2085.30s -> 2085.94s]  Old joke.
[2087.70s -> 2089.38s]  No, old joke is fine.
[2089.38s -> 2090.18s]  I didn't know-
[2090.18s -> 2090.74s]  I'm lucky.
[2090.74s -> 2091.46s]  Okay, okay, okay.
[2091.46s -> 2093.14s]  Just stop jumping, will you?
[2093.86s -> 2097.94s]  If you take this golden spatula, will you please go away?
[2097.94s -> 2098.58s]  Wait, I get it.
[2099.70s -> 2101.30s]  See, Squidward?
[2101.30s -> 2103.14s]  I knew that you could help me out.
[2103.14s -> 2104.10s]  You're the best.
[2105.46s -> 2106.42s]  Don't touch me.
[2107.14s -> 2107.62s]  Wait, he's gonna-
[2108.26s -> 2109.14s]  I just came in here and-
[2110.02s -> 2112.90s]  This is like mob protection money.
[2112.90s -> 2115.78s]  I just came in here and trashed all of his stuff to get the currency.
[2116.58s -> 2117.70s]  That's wicked fucked up.
[2118.34s -> 2130.86s]  All right, can I-
[2130.86s -> 2131.82s]  The Squidward or what?
[2132.46s -> 2135.03s]  His name's not Squidward.
[2135.03s -> 2136.07s]  It's Squidward.
[2136.07s -> 2136.95s]  He only has one room?
[2136.95s -> 2138.31s]  I thought he has a bathtub upstairs.
[2139.11s -> 2141.27s]  He can't go in his upstairs bathtub thing?
[2144.09s -> 2145.29s]  Go kill the painting.
[2147.11s -> 2147.75s]  Come on.
[2147.75s -> 2148.23s]  What?
[2148.23s -> 2148.79s]  What do you mean?
[2150.47s -> 2151.51s]  Break all this stuff.
[2151.51s -> 2151.91s]  I did.
[2151.91s -> 2152.71s]  Didn't I break it all?
[2153.51s -> 2155.51s]  I didn't know Squidward had a lamp.
[2159.58s -> 2160.54s]  Oh, he turns into-
[2161.26s -> 2162.06s]  Squaliam.
[2162.78s -> 2166.41s]  Oh, Jerma pretends to like this show.
[2166.41s -> 2166.73s]  Does he?
[2167.45s -> 2170.54s]  How would I have fucking known that?
[2187.66s -> 2188.62s]  Hey, Patrick.
[2188.62s -> 2189.58s]  What sock?
[2189.58s -> 2190.06s]  Oh, right.
[2190.06s -> 2190.86s]  What are the socks for?
[2190.86s -> 2192.06s]  The one you're standing on.
[2192.62s -> 2193.90s]  Oh, that one.
[2194.62s -> 2195.66s]  It's lost.
[2196.54s -> 2199.74s]  Well, if that one's lost, where are your other socks?
[2200.46s -> 2201.98s]  Well, they're more lost.
[2201.98s -> 2206.06s]  A bunch of robots came through here and stole my whole sock collection.
[2206.06s -> 2208.38s]  I could use some help getting them back.
[2208.38s -> 2209.02s]  What do I get?
[2209.02s -> 2209.66s]  Sure thing, Patrick.
[2209.66s -> 2211.34s]  What are best friends for?
[2211.34s -> 2212.38s]  Okay, then.
[2212.38s -> 2215.18s]  For every 10 socks you bring back to me,
[2215.18s -> 2218.38s]  I'll give you a golden turkey baster.
[2218.38s -> 2219.66s]  You mean spatula?
[2220.70s -> 2221.26s]  Bless you.
[2221.90s -> 2228.97s]  Oh, so this is the red coins of SpongeBob.
[2229.93s -> 2234.39s]  Living under a rock.
[2234.39s -> 2235.11s]  Does he have anything?
[2235.11s -> 2236.07s]  And that's the life.
[2237.43s -> 2239.94s]  Love opening presents.
[2239.94s -> 2240.98s]  Too pretty.
[2240.98s -> 2242.18s]  Holy shit, SpongeBob.
[2242.18s -> 2242.50s]  Really?
[2243.54s -> 2244.86s]  Are you going to first of all-
[2244.86s -> 2246.46s]  Are you going to break into your buddy's house
[2246.46s -> 2250.70s]  who owns a sofa and not even a carpet or anything?
[2251.26s -> 2251.98s]  And that's what you're going to do?
[2251.98s -> 2252.62s]  You take his stuff?
[2253.50s -> 2258.38s]  This?
[2258.38s -> 2258.70s]  Wait.
[2258.86s -> 2261.51s]  Oh, man.
[2261.51s -> 2263.19s]  And I'm going to destroy his sofa.
[2263.19s -> 2263.59s]  That's good.
[2264.23s -> 2266.89s]  You're the one controlling him.
[2269.62s -> 2270.42s]  So?
[2270.42s -> 2277.05s]  What?
[2277.05s -> 2278.41s]  Why is everybody freaking out about that?
[2278.41s -> 2279.53s]  That's part of the video game.
[2280.57s -> 2281.59s]  All right, so I have-
[2281.59s -> 2282.47s]  How many do I have?
[2282.47s -> 2283.67s]  I need two more.
[2284.39s -> 2287.72s]  Okay, let's go this way.
[2287.72s -> 2290.47s]  Let's do some platforming.
[2290.47s -> 2296.07s]  What?
[2296.07s -> 2297.11s]  Am I getting invisible wall?
[2297.91s -> 2300.01s]  Shit, I am getting-
[2300.01s -> 2300.97s]  I'm getting invisible wall.
[2300.97s -> 2301.45s]  That's-
[2301.45s -> 2302.25s]  What the heck?
[2302.25s -> 2311.03s]  I have 240 of these.
[2311.03s -> 2316.14s]  All right, so go to jellyfish fields.
[2317.99s -> 2320.23s]  Okay, I'll go to jellyfish fields.
[2320.79s -> 2323.75s]  Is there a dash or a run?
[2324.71s -> 2327.86s]  Or am I already running?
[2333.34s -> 2334.78s]  Hey, I can't.
[2344.63s -> 2345.83s]  You can't walk there.
[2345.83s -> 2349.35s]  You have to go through the taxi thing.
[2351.19s -> 2352.55s]  Oh, this is where we get to start.
[2352.55s -> 2353.59s]  Jellyfish fields.
[2353.59s -> 2356.31s]  A place to experience nature at its most raw.
[2356.31s -> 2357.43s]  I can't walk there?
[2357.43s -> 2359.99s]  And sometimes a bit tender from the stings.
[2361.27s -> 2370.25s]  Horrible scream.
[2372.09s -> 2379.96s]  That's the kind of scream that I feel like Squidward
[2379.96s -> 2381.80s]  was lying on like the medieval stretcher.
[2383.59s -> 2385.11s]  That was fucking nuts.
[2385.11s -> 2391.83s]  Squidward, are you okay?
[2391.83s -> 2394.71s]  Hey, you barnacle.
[2394.71s -> 2400.87s]  I mean, bigger than usual because it's usually pretty-
[2400.87s -> 2401.91s]  I mean, that thing's gigantic.
[2401.91s -> 2402.95s]  And you look clammy and-
[2402.95s -> 2404.82s]  I mean, Santa.
[2404.82s -> 2406.18s]  That's my favorite thing.
[2406.18s -> 2407.30s]  That's my favorite line.
[2408.18s -> 2411.67s]  When Squidward's pretending to be Santa Claus
[2411.67s -> 2414.55s]  and SpongeBob keeps talking about how big his nose is,
[2414.55s -> 2415.35s]  it's like just-
[2415.35s -> 2416.71s]  It's total cartoon comedy.
[2417.51s -> 2422.34s]  Always been bald, but now I'm stung all over.
[2422.34s -> 2425.22s]  Well, according to the jellyfisher field manual,
[2425.22s -> 2427.94s]  severe jellyfish stings can be treated effectively
[2427.94s -> 2431.30s]  by applying a thick layer of king jellyfish jelly
[2431.30s -> 2432.42s]  to the affected areas.
[2434.66s -> 2436.58s]  King j-j-j-jellyfish!
[2438.18s -> 2438.90s]  I'm not bald?
[2438.90s -> 2440.10s]  Yeah, neither am I.
[2440.10s -> 2441.94s]  Good, we got something in common, you and I.
[2442.58s -> 2443.46s]  Well, I guess you're on the scale-
[2443.46s -> 2444.26s]  We gotta go kill the king jellyfish?
[2444.26s -> 2448.23s]  ...sport mountain and die off the vicious tentacles
[2448.23s -> 2449.43s]  of king jellyfish.
[2452.54s -> 2456.70s]  I'll stay here, bald up here in excruciating pain.
[2456.70s -> 2457.74s]  You do that!
[2457.74s -> 2459.10s]  Don't worry, Squidward.
[2459.10s -> 2461.34s]  I'll bring back that king jellyfish jelly
[2461.34s -> 2462.94s]  for you to rub all over yourself.
[2465.91s -> 2466.71s]  Real voice.
[2468.31s -> 2469.67s]  He's just pretending the whole time.
[2470.47s -> 2471.11s]  All right, let's go.
[2471.99s -> 2472.79s]  What did I do that for?
[2472.79s -> 2476.47s]  I didn't get every single crusties.
[2476.47s -> 2477.67s]  All right, that's okay.
[2477.67s -> 2478.71s]  I'm gonna have to call them crusties.
[2478.71s -> 2480.63s]  That's how I can't call them anything else.
[2485.13s -> 2485.69s]  Ooh, what's this?
[2486.49s -> 2487.90s]  Can I catch the jellyfish?
[2487.90s -> 2488.46s]  Like, what does it do?
[2488.46s -> 2488.96s]  Nothing.
[2490.78s -> 2491.50s]  This is goo.
[2492.14s -> 2494.30s]  SpongeBob and Patrick can't swim,
[2494.30s -> 2495.82s]  so don't let them fall in the goo.
[2501.22s -> 2508.42s]  So how much currency is a lot?
[2509.38s -> 2511.22s]  This is a teleport box.
[2511.22s -> 2513.13s]  When you have both of the teleport boxes
[2513.13s -> 2513.93s]  in the area open,
[2513.93s -> 2515.93s]  you may teleport between them by jumping inside.
[2516.97s -> 2520.14s]  I don't have both, I don't think.
[2520.70s -> 2523.37s]  I think I have to touch both, probably.
[2524.66s -> 2525.46s]  Yeah.
[2525.46s -> 2526.02s]  All right, let's go.
[2527.14s -> 2529.62s]  Collect everything.
[2529.62s -> 2530.50s]  Do I have full underwear?
[2535.70s -> 2536.42s]  Just said that.
[2536.98s -> 2539.69s]  Yeah, I'm just processing information.
[2540.49s -> 2543.96s]  You have your way to process info, and I have mine.
[2544.84s -> 2546.84s]  Mine happens to be I say something out loud
[2547.80s -> 2549.00s]  and then go over it.
[2550.60s -> 2552.04s]  I know, I already know what it is.
[2553.16s -> 2558.15s]  I have to just activate my audio processor.
[2561.05s -> 2561.69s]  Ow, that hurt.
[2562.25s -> 2563.72s]  Does it want to kill him?
[2563.72s -> 2566.20s]  All right, I don't want to die in SpongeBob
[2566.20s -> 2567.32s]  Battle for Bikini Bottom.
[2572.86s -> 2573.90s]  Hold on, does this bounce?
[2574.54s -> 2575.04s]  Wow.
[2577.50s -> 2578.22s]  All right, that's fun.
[2578.94s -> 2579.44s]  Yeah.
[2580.22s -> 2584.14s]  Wait, I probably can get pretty far from there.
[2584.14s -> 2584.64s]  Hold on.
[2588.66s -> 2589.46s]  This is great.
[2591.56s -> 2592.52s]  This is fun.
[2592.52s -> 2593.40s]  I like this game.
[2598.65s -> 2600.89s]  Am I allowed to say this is better than Mario Odyssey?
[2601.61s -> 2602.41s]  Fuck.
[2609.05s -> 2609.55s]  I'm sorry.
[2617.51s -> 2618.63s]  It's not, okay?
[2619.35s -> 2620.15s]  It's not.
[2620.15s -> 2621.35s]  It's called a joke.
[2622.31s -> 2624.31s]  I, that Mario Odyssey's fan.
[2624.31s -> 2625.11s]  Oh, fuck.
[2625.11s -> 2625.91s]  What am I supposed to do?
[2625.91s -> 2626.63s]  I can't go back.
[2628.68s -> 2629.96s]  I'm not supposed to step on the gas.
[2630.76s -> 2634.86s]  It was 125.
[2635.50s -> 2646.01s]  Oh, checkpoint.
[2646.01s -> 2646.81s]  Step on the gas.
[2646.81s -> 2647.77s]  Step on the brakes.
[2648.41s -> 2650.26s]  Step on the gas.
[2650.26s -> 2651.14s]  Step on the brake.
[2651.14s -> 2652.98s]  Now step on the, well, you're saying it wrong.
[2652.98s -> 2656.74s]  It's, step gas, step on brake, step on, step on, step gas.
[2657.54s -> 2659.06s]  I would have understood what you were talking about
[2659.06s -> 2659.86s]  if you said it that way.
[2660.98s -> 2666.49s]  Wait, I don't want to go over there yet.
[2669.05s -> 2674.47s]  Okay, where do I want to go?
[2674.47s -> 2676.31s]  There are green shamrocks over there.
[2677.03s -> 2678.58s]  I want them.
[2678.58s -> 2680.12s]  I got to check, I'll get his underwear over there.
[2682.95s -> 2683.75s]  That's a secret.
[2684.74s -> 2685.54s]  Yeah, but I know.
[2685.54s -> 2690.60s]  Look, I'm, hey, you play your Super Mario Odyssey games
[2690.60s -> 2692.36s]  the way you play, the way you like,
[2692.36s -> 2694.52s]  and I play my Super Mario Odyssey games
[2694.52s -> 2695.32s]  the way that I like.
[2695.88s -> 2703.34s]  Holy shit.
[2703.34s -> 2703.90s]  Look at this.
[2705.42s -> 2708.23s]  Am I going to die if I go down here?
[2712.25s -> 2713.37s]  This is goo, right?
[2714.01s -> 2715.98s]  Can I land on it, though?
[2715.98s -> 2716.94s]  What if I just land on it?
[2717.50s -> 2721.54s]  If I land on it, does it, okay, I have a question.
[2722.26s -> 2724.18s]  So if I touch this, does it go like,
[2724.58s -> 2730.23s]  and we get a silhouette close around the character?
[2732.36s -> 2734.97s]  Yeah, and then we go back to the beginning.
[2735.53s -> 2745.45s]  I didn't touch it.
[2745.45s -> 2745.95s]  How?
[2746.49s -> 2753.86s]  Is there a penalty for losing?
[2754.34s -> 2763.15s]  What?
[2767.59s -> 2768.71s]  There's no way I didn't touch that.
[2769.85s -> 2771.45s]  I don't know how that's, I touched it.
[2771.45s -> 2772.09s]  I touched it.
[2774.54s -> 2775.50s]  I slow that down.
[2776.14s -> 2782.84s]  I can't touch it.
[2782.84s -> 2784.12s]  You don't get it this way.
[2784.12s -> 2786.60s]  You can't get it that way.
[2786.60s -> 2789.90s]  Well, look, there's no penalty for dying.
[2790.54s -> 2792.70s]  As a whole joke.
[2792.70s -> 2793.98s]  No, I'm touching it.
[2794.54s -> 2799.21s]  You're wasting underwear.
[2799.77s -> 2802.36s]  What do you mean wasting underwear?
[2802.36s -> 2806.12s]  Does SpongeBob piss his pants or shit his pants every time he fucking dies?
[2806.12s -> 2806.68s]  Wow.
[2806.68s -> 2807.08s]  Shit.
[2807.08s -> 2807.80s]  Yeah, you do.
[2807.80s -> 2808.28s]  Okay.
[2808.28s -> 2808.92s]  That makes sense.
[2808.92s -> 2809.42s]  Never mind.
[2812.42s -> 2813.22s]  Yeah, I forgot.
[2813.22s -> 2814.18s]  What does that happen to you?
[2822.44s -> 2822.94s]  Everybody.
[2825.21s -> 2827.69s]  The question I should be asking is why does he come back to life?
[2828.41s -> 2833.43s]  That's plain.
[2835.03s -> 2835.27s]  All right.
[2835.27s -> 2836.15s]  How do I get that sock?
[2837.82s -> 2840.78s]  Hmm.
[2840.78s -> 2841.58s]  I'm going to use the bracelet.
[2844.86s -> 2845.74s]  It's a video game.
[2848.54s -> 2849.74s]  Yeah, I, what?
[2849.74s -> 2851.02s]  I was just talking.
[2851.02s -> 2851.52s]  Okay.
[2852.38s -> 2854.06s]  If you are defeated after activating a checkpoint,
[2854.06s -> 2856.30s]  you restart at the checkpoint instead of at the beginning of the area.
[2857.10s -> 2862.44s]  So how do I get this?
[2863.82s -> 2864.94s]  It shines.
[2864.94s -> 2866.94s]  Oh, is it like a floating thing I can use eventually?
[2872.02s -> 2872.42s]  Doctor.
[2872.42s -> 2873.62s]  He thinks he's screaming again.
[2878.04s -> 2878.68s]  Yes, he does.
[2880.33s -> 2880.73s]  He does.
[2881.53s -> 2882.09s]  Because he is.
[2885.06s -> 2885.86s]  Tell the story.
[2886.50s -> 2896.86s]  I'm just going to thousand of these things.
[2896.86s -> 2897.26s]  Whoops.
[2897.26s -> 2897.76s]  What was that?
[2899.26s -> 2899.76s]  Fear?
[2900.30s -> 2901.42s]  This is a freezing fruit.
[2902.06s -> 2904.38s]  Only Patrick can use the freezing fruit.
[2905.54s -> 2906.04s]  Why?
[2906.90s -> 2912.63s]  I can't have like a nice ice cold fucking draft beer.
[2917.77s -> 2918.27s]  Ah.
[2919.29s -> 2920.33s]  SpongeBob not old enough.
[2924.66s -> 2925.16s]  Minus two.
[2932.73s -> 2934.25s]  Oh, I missed this.
[2934.25s -> 2935.21s]  I missed this.
[2935.21s -> 2936.81s]  This is like my favorite thing on earth.
[2936.81s -> 2938.33s]  I'm so glad I'm here again.
[2938.33s -> 2940.01s]  I missed this shit so much.
[2942.84s -> 2943.64s]  Ultra combo.
[2944.12s -> 2950.22s]  I think I needed those.
[2950.22s -> 2959.21s]  Can I make this?
[2963.29s -> 2964.41s]  What's this do?
[2965.11s -> 2966.46s]  It's going to be timed, isn't it?
[2967.64s -> 2968.20s]  Well, what is it?
[2968.20s -> 2968.70s]  A big one?
[2975.11s -> 2975.91s]  Whoa, what the?
[2975.91s -> 2976.87s]  Hey, what?
[2977.43s -> 2982.58s]  This dude's addicted to streaming.
[2983.30s -> 2984.18s]  I thought I had it.
[2985.22s -> 2987.46s]  Apparently not.
[2989.77s -> 2990.33s]  Half life.
[2991.29s -> 2994.46s]  It is.
[2995.99s -> 2996.87s]  It is half life.
[2997.67s -> 3010.57s]  All right.
[3010.57s -> 3011.05s]  You need to do it.
[3011.77s -> 3012.94s]  Okay.
[3012.94s -> 3017.02s]  It's kind of hard because usually you just watch the shadow in these 3D platformers.
[3019.02s -> 3019.74s]  Kind of hot.
[3019.74s -> 3020.38s]  Ooh, purple.
[3020.38s -> 3021.18s]  What's how much purple?
[3022.06s -> 3023.18s]  842.
[3024.38s -> 3025.02s]  8.
[3025.02s -> 3025.50s]  Okay.
[3025.50s -> 3026.38s]  872.
[3027.10s -> 3028.22s]  892.
[3028.22s -> 3029.66s]  Oh, that's like a Sonic the Hedgehog thing.
[3036.02s -> 3036.58s]  Oh, all right.
[3036.58s -> 3037.38s]  That was a thousand.
[3038.18s -> 3049.83s]  Bro, please watch the shadows.
[3050.47s -> 3059.38s]  And do you guys remember when Mario Odyssey came out with the two player mode?
[3059.38s -> 3060.74s]  That was not even a two player mode.
[3060.74s -> 3062.74s]  It was just like a like a holy shit.
[3062.74s -> 3064.58s]  Like your little brother gets to at least do something.
[3065.78s -> 3074.63s]  I stopped talking shit about Mario.
[3074.63s -> 3075.59s]  Like what am I doing?
[3076.63s -> 3077.35s]  What am I thinking?
[3077.35s -> 3078.15s]  What's wrong with me?
[3083.30s -> 3084.50s]  I love that franchise.
[3084.50s -> 3085.22s]  Like what am I doing?
[3086.02s -> 3091.72s]  I feel like a new sponge.
[3099.40s -> 3101.32s]  He's breaking his conditioning.
[3102.04s -> 3103.75s]  Hey, Gary.
[3103.75s -> 3104.79s]  What's shaking?
[3104.79s -> 3105.35s]  Hey, Gary.
[3105.35s -> 3107.03s]  Was someone shooting the cannonballs?
[3113.91s -> 3114.55s]  He won.
[3114.55s -> 3115.72s]  Wow.
[3115.72s -> 3116.36s]  Don't touch that.
[3116.36s -> 3127.24s]  A bungee jump for a guttula.
[3127.24s -> 3128.12s]  Hang jellyfish.
[3128.12s -> 3129.32s]  Oh, that's the first boss.
[3130.12s -> 3133.42s]  But I want to see what this does.
[3133.98s -> 3136.25s]  This is a bungee jump.
[3136.25s -> 3137.93s]  SpongeBob can bungee from it.
[3138.57s -> 3139.69s]  Bungee from the bungee hook.
[3139.69s -> 3140.81s]  Just jump up and touch it.
[3141.45s -> 3142.49s]  Dive, press A.
[3143.53s -> 3144.65s]  To exit the hook, press B.
[3144.65s -> 3154.79s]  Oh, that's how you do it.
[3155.83s -> 3157.30s]  Got it.
[3159.06s -> 3160.02s]  That's how you get it.
[3160.02s -> 3160.66s]  Okay, cool.
[3164.79s -> 3165.27s]  Nice.
[3165.27s -> 3166.23s]  All right, that's how you do it.
[3172.55s -> 3173.99s]  Let's go kill King Jellyfish.
[3174.71s -> 3177.03s]  Get four.
[3184.87s -> 3185.67s]  I promise.
[3185.67s -> 3188.23s]  I know there's a lot of people probably waiting for me to do
[3188.23s -> 3190.87s]  like the Quentin Central classic.
[3190.87s -> 3192.87s]  Dive when you move your finger up and down your throat.
[3195.22s -> 3196.34s]  It's going to be crazed.
[3196.34s -> 3197.22s]  I'm going to do it at one point.
[3197.22s -> 3198.10s]  I'm not going to tell you when.
[3198.98s -> 3200.50s]  But that's the only reason why you're here.
[3202.22s -> 3204.46s]  It's going to happen fucking crazed at one point.
[3205.26s -> 3205.66s]  I don't know.
[3205.66s -> 3206.86s]  It could happen like four hours.
[3206.86s -> 3207.50s]  I have no idea.
[3210.79s -> 3212.79s]  Just my size.
[3212.79s -> 3214.95s]  You've just met the Sponginator.
[3220.10s -> 3227.91s]  Hey, are you guys minus doing SpongeBob?
[3228.63s -> 3229.83s]  I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
[3243.74s -> 3244.38s]  Hey, what?
[3244.38s -> 3245.10s]  Can I reverse it?
[3245.74s -> 3254.79s]  I just, how do I talk?
[3267.58s -> 3268.14s]  I need underwear.
[3268.14s -> 3269.34s]  If I'm going to fight King Jellyfish,
[3269.34s -> 3270.30s]  how the hell am I going to do this?
[3271.18s -> 3278.20s]  I'm going to wait until after he swings down the hand.
[3279.08s -> 3288.62s]  You know how, you know when there's a game mechanic
[3288.62s -> 3291.26s]  that is just stuck in your brain forever
[3291.26s -> 3292.14s]  and you'll never get rid of it.
[3293.26s -> 3294.86s]  I was just thinking to myself,
[3294.86s -> 3296.46s]  like, oh, I wish there was like a dodge roll.
[3297.58s -> 3299.74s]  It doesn't have to be in every single game.
[3299.74s -> 3301.34s]  But it kind of does now, doesn't it?
[3302.14s -> 3307.48s]  FromSoftware has ruined all video games.
[3309.08s -> 3317.38s]  Because if there's not like a, like what have they done?
[3323.43s -> 3336.86s]  Oh, no.
[3336.86s -> 3337.42s]  What?
[3337.42s -> 3340.97s]  I thought I could get the edge.
[3340.97s -> 3341.53s]  Okay.
[3341.53s -> 3344.36s]  Friends of Persia did it first?
[3345.08s -> 3351.94s]  Yeah, when I'm talking about who did it first,
[3351.94s -> 3353.22s]  I'm talking about who did it best.
[3359.48s -> 3361.40s]  Yeah, back in like the fucking 1700s,
[3361.40s -> 3362.60s]  a guy made up toothpaste.
[3362.60s -> 3364.20s]  He was brushing his teeth with like cream.
[3365.50s -> 3366.30s]  He did it first.
[3367.10s -> 3371.37s]  It wasn't until fucking Dave Colgate came along.
[3372.92s -> 3373.72s]  He did it best.
[3384.70s -> 3386.30s]  Yeah, the guy that made the toothbrush is cool
[3386.30s -> 3387.98s]  when the guy that was brushing his teeth was sand.
[3399.22s -> 3400.42s]  You're a corporate shill.
[3401.22s -> 3407.66s]  A corporate shill.
[3411.02s -> 3411.42s]  Okay.
[3411.42s -> 3411.82s]  All right.
[3411.82s -> 3412.14s]  All right.
[3412.14s -> 3412.70s]  You ready?
[3412.70s -> 3413.02s]  Ready?
[3413.02s -> 3413.98s]  Three, two, one.
[3413.98s -> 3415.90s]  Name any other brand of toothpaste right now.
[3415.90s -> 3416.54s]  Go.
[3416.54s -> 3418.62s]  Name a single brand of toothpaste that's not Colgate.
[3418.62s -> 3418.86s]  Go.
[3421.83s -> 3422.15s]  Fuck.
[3422.15s -> 3422.47s]  Crest.
[3422.47s -> 3422.79s]  All right.
[3422.79s -> 3423.51s]  Not Crest.
[3423.51s -> 3424.87s]  Something else is not Crest.
[3426.52s -> 3427.80s]  This is like three, okay?
[3429.24s -> 3430.28s]  There's like one.
[3430.28s -> 3431.56s]  There's two on Earth.
[3436.01s -> 3436.57s]  Oral-B.
[3437.21s -> 3440.25s]  Oh, but that's only if you want to brush like a dentist.
[3440.25s -> 3440.75s]  Fuck.
[3447.80s -> 3448.44s]  Aquafresh?
[3448.44s -> 3448.92s]  Aquafresh?
[3448.92s -> 3449.88s]  Yeah, Aquafresh.
[3449.88s -> 3450.84s]  Why can I not say this word?
[3450.84s -> 3452.60s]  Aquafresh is the best by far.
[3453.24s -> 3454.58s]  Without a doubt in my mind.
[3455.46s -> 3457.62s]  Like everybody just buys Colgate and Crest.
[3457.62s -> 3458.34s]  Like what the fuck?
[3458.34s -> 3459.38s]  It's just the easiest thing to get.
[3459.38s -> 3460.26s]  But Aquafresh.
[3460.26s -> 3460.90s]  Holy shit.
[3460.90s -> 3464.10s]  Especially that like orange like shower cream like one.
[3464.10s -> 3465.14s]  You know what I'm talking about?
[3465.14s -> 3466.82s]  The one that said it was a shower for your mouth.
[3466.82s -> 3467.78s]  It was like an ad campaign.
[3467.78s -> 3469.14s]  It was just marketing bullshit.
[3469.14s -> 3470.18s]  That was the best one by far.
[3471.30s -> 3471.94s]  It was the orange.
[3471.94s -> 3473.54s]  It had the orange line.
[3473.54s -> 3477.46s]  It was the Aquafresh like shower for your mouth clean.
[3477.46s -> 3478.58s]  It was the best one.
[3479.46s -> 3487.70s]  Show the ad.
[3490.60s -> 3491.56s]  I don't think there was an ad.
[3499.78s -> 3500.42s]  Show the ad.
[3500.42s -> 3501.14s]  I don't think it.
[3501.14s -> 3502.18s]  I don't think they just.
[3502.18s -> 3503.70s]  The ad was just it was on the shelf.
[3503.70s -> 3504.42s]  And that's what they said.
[3505.30s -> 3513.66s]  Let's see.
[3513.66s -> 3517.10s]  Aquafresh shower for your mouth.
[3525.30s -> 3529.22s]  What the fuck?
[3529.22s -> 3529.94s]  There's this.
[3529.94s -> 3530.98s]  Wait a minute.
[3530.98s -> 3535.54s]  The first thing that pops up is a shower for your mouth.
[3538.31s -> 3539.27s]  What is this thing?
[3545.48s -> 3546.28s]  Can we go over?
[3546.28s -> 3547.88s]  Can we examine this for just a minute?
[3549.03s -> 3549.43s]  Okay.
[3549.43s -> 3549.99s]  What is this?
[3562.46s -> 3563.58s]  I don't want to put that image up.
[3563.58s -> 3563.90s]  Okay.
[3564.78s -> 3565.34s]  It's this one.
[3565.34s -> 3565.82s]  What is this?
[3567.50s -> 3571.26s]  Do you put your mouth up around the edges of that and just turn it on?
[3571.82s -> 3573.82s]  How does this work?
[3573.82s -> 3575.64s]  I like it.
[3575.64s -> 3576.92s]  I'm intrigued by this.
[3576.92s -> 3578.36s]  This actually is.
[3578.36s -> 3579.96s]  I kind of want to see how this works.
[3581.67s -> 3584.15s]  Do you like wrapping your mouth around?
[3584.15s -> 3587.83s]  It's the hose.
[3588.47s -> 3590.26s]  So wait, you put.
[3590.26s -> 3590.50s]  Okay.
[3590.50s -> 3591.30s]  So hold on a minute.
[3591.30s -> 3591.94s]  This is it.
[3591.94s -> 3592.66s]  I love this.
[3593.46s -> 3594.18s]  I don't know why.
[3594.18s -> 3594.82s]  I like this.
[3595.46s -> 3599.90s]  So the red cap is like the toothpaste or something.
[3599.90s -> 3603.42s]  And then you like you turn the hose on with this in your mouth and you just like.
[3611.72s -> 3613.08s]  It does not go.
[3614.52s -> 3615.72s]  No, it does not go.
[3616.28s -> 3617.32s]  I'm not even going to say it.
[3617.88s -> 3621.90s]  It's as seen on TV.
[3622.62s -> 3627.05s]  It's a water flosser for your shower head.
[3629.38s -> 3630.42s]  I think I want this.
[3631.14s -> 3635.11s]  Do you know how hard it is to floss every day?
[3635.11s -> 3638.63s]  Imagine you can just like put a tube in your mouth and just turn the water on full blast.
[3639.61s -> 3640.25s]  Does this work?
[3640.25s -> 3641.37s]  It's got four stars.
[3642.09s -> 3644.41s]  I'm not even fucking around with you right now.
[3644.41s -> 3648.49s]  This is the this has four stars on Amazon with like 2000 fucking reviews.
[3648.49s -> 3649.69s]  This thing is probably cool.
[3650.33s -> 3653.22s]  I got to look into this after the stream.
[3653.94s -> 3655.70s]  All right, let's go.
[3669.30s -> 3676.42s]  You guys are so fucked up and I'm the fucking weird guy, right?
[3676.42s -> 3676.98s]  That's the thing.
[3677.62s -> 3678.42s]  I'm the weird guy.
[3679.06s -> 3685.56s]  This is very dangerous for just one health pack.
[3685.56s -> 3696.57s]  Oh, yeah.
[3696.57s -> 3698.17s]  Try this new water flosser.
[3698.89s -> 3700.82s]  It goes.
[3701.62s -> 3706.22s]  I can't say it.
[3706.78s -> 3707.50s]  I can't even.
[3707.50s -> 3708.06s]  I can't do it.
[3712.87s -> 3717.99s]  You connect it to your bidet and do put it in.
[3717.99s -> 3721.19s]  But all right, I'm moving on.
[3722.07s -> 3724.79s]  And what you as you're on the toilet, you put it in the
[3727.83s -> 3730.47s]  and then what spit down between your legs into the toilet.
[3733.78s -> 3734.26s]  Yeah, I got.
[3734.26s -> 3740.89s]  Oh, I got the teleport that machine huffing and puffing over.
[3740.89s -> 3744.25s]  There is a duplicate duplicate OTRON.
[3744.81s -> 3748.01s]  I'm going to call it the duplicator, duplicator, the duplicator.
[3748.73s -> 3752.86s]  I'll call the D 1000 that will continue to create robots until it's destroyed.
[3753.58s -> 3755.19s]  Be careful, though.
[3755.19s -> 3757.27s]  It goes out with a big bang.
[3764.92s -> 3765.64s]  Oh, you can.
[3765.64s -> 3766.57s]  That's cool.
[3767.53s -> 3769.46s]  All right, we got to kill this thing.
[3769.46s -> 3774.49s]  That was a big bang, wasn't it?
[3775.13s -> 3777.32s]  All right.
[3777.32s -> 3778.28s]  Well, there's a button.
[3783.69s -> 3786.25s]  Coked out streamer flosses his teeth in the bidet.
[3790.09s -> 3790.65s]  All right.
[3790.65s -> 3791.45s]  All right.
[3791.45s -> 3798.41s]  You know, as well as I do, that there is there is a 90s comedy or an early 2000s comedy
[3798.41s -> 3803.37s]  where like Will Ferrell has to really get something out of his mouth and rinse his mouth.
[3803.37s -> 3807.53s]  And oh, what's this up a day?
[3807.53s -> 3811.29s]  And he leans down like fucking cartoon three stooges style
[3811.29s -> 3813.77s]  and turns it on and starts like rinsing his mouth out and like
[3814.49s -> 3815.61s]  spitting into the toilet with a bidet.
[3815.61s -> 3816.65s]  You know, it existed.
[3816.65s -> 3817.85s]  It's in a movie somewhere.
[3817.85s -> 3820.25s]  I don't know which one and I don't know when, but it happened.
[3829.69s -> 3830.41s]  Let me look it up.
[3830.97s -> 3834.06s]  Nobody look up.
[3834.06s -> 3836.14s]  Will Ferrell rinses mouth with a bidet.
[3838.79s -> 3853.91s]  I feel like that's that sounds like where's the king jellyfish already?
[3853.91s -> 3854.55s]  Is he up there?
[3855.43s -> 3861.66s]  All right, I got I have five that is it's in a movie.
[3861.66s -> 3863.78s]  It's a life hack.
[3863.78s -> 3866.46s]  Mr. Bean did it.
[3866.46s -> 3867.18s]  No, he didn't.
[3867.18s -> 3868.22s]  He's too clean for that.
[3868.78s -> 3872.81s]  I want to go up.
[3873.69s -> 3876.49s]  Is there anything else I missed up there?
[3877.29s -> 3880.84s]  I mean, he's not.
[3885.96s -> 3888.49s]  Go back.
[3888.49s -> 3888.97s]  Wrong way.
[3889.77s -> 3893.53s]  Mr. Bean is is too clean to do that.
[3893.53s -> 3896.17s]  He's he's like PG clean, fun humor.
[3896.17s -> 3896.65s]  He's not.
[3897.53s -> 3908.15s]  It's like a cave in the trees.
[3910.71s -> 3911.96s]  Germa, the trees.
[3911.96s -> 3912.92s]  Germa, the trees.
[3919.64s -> 3921.32s]  I mean, these the bouncy trees.
[3923.03s -> 3925.11s]  Oh, look at those bouncy trees.
[3927.91s -> 3928.71s]  Literally, no.
[3931.86s -> 3933.38s]  Look, I can get up there with the bouncy tree.
[3935.72s -> 3936.22s]  Watch.
[3942.50s -> 3944.02s]  There's a sock over here.
[3948.25s -> 3950.57s]  Get up there.
[3951.77s -> 3952.57s]  Yeah, this is what I want.
[3953.85s -> 3957.70s]  There's another bouncy right here.
[3958.90s -> 3962.60s]  Somebody just say you're a dick.
[3963.16s -> 3963.88s]  I'm a dick.
[3965.08s -> 3965.56s]  What happened?
[4025.30s -> 4030.17s]  Sorry, I had to I had to give Kim some information that was sensitive.
[4030.17s -> 4033.29s]  So I had to say it very quietly without the mic on.
[4035.70s -> 4041.77s]  I could sensitive info was crying.
[4046.89s -> 4047.53s]  I'm going.
[4049.11s -> 4053.40s]  I'm sitting there just crying like a second day back.
[4055.64s -> 4059.66s]  I'm just going to the caves.
[4059.66s -> 4060.94s]  Let's go go caves.
[4061.74s -> 4067.77s]  He lost in a kid's game.
[4068.73s -> 4074.70s]  It's only been like six months since he's done.
[4074.70s -> 4075.26s]  Miss Piggy.
[4081.26s -> 4082.96s]  What?
[4083.90s -> 4089.34s]  It's that sponge kid and now what was I supposed to tell you?
[4092.94s -> 4095.26s]  Oh, it's that SpongeBob kid.
[4096.22s -> 4098.14s]  Now, what was I supposed to tell you?
[4107.64s -> 4111.72s]  I think it has something to do with massaging my feet.
[4113.32s -> 4115.48s]  What do you want to say it?
[4122.58s -> 4129.54s]  I think we need to get into the Batmobile and get over there and destroy it.
[4129.54s -> 4130.50s]  What should I say it?
[4130.50s -> 4131.14s]  I should say it.
[4132.34s -> 4141.54s]  Fuck.
[4141.54s -> 4142.18s]  It's an old man.
[4142.18s -> 4142.98s]  I just did that.
[4142.98s -> 4143.48s]  Whoops.
[4143.94s -> 4146.84s]  And my fingers slipped and it was an X button working quickly.
[4149.50s -> 4151.72s]  This is a slide.
[4152.52s -> 4155.40s]  When SpongeBob, Patrick, or Sandy jump onto a slide,
[4155.40s -> 4158.52s]  they will zip down the slope at hydrodynamic speed.
[4168.12s -> 4174.42s]  Didn't think I knew about the secret spot, did you?
[4186.87s -> 4191.91s]  I was going so well, too.
[4191.91s -> 4192.95s]  I was going so well.
[4193.67s -> 4206.62s]  Oh, so by the way, I didn't tell this story because there's too many over the last few months.
[4206.62s -> 4208.92s]  Okay, seriously.
[4208.92s -> 4209.88s]  Don't tell any stories.
[4209.88s -> 4211.00s]  Get the fucking secret song.
[4214.10s -> 4214.90s]  Play Half-Life.
[4214.90s -> 4216.10s]  No, I don't want to play Half-Life.
[4216.90s -> 4218.90s]  It's a fantastic series and it's one of my favorites.
[4220.62s -> 4222.78s]  I've already done it a bunch of times.
[4223.66s -> 4225.74s]  No, no, I want to do something else.
[4225.74s -> 4227.54s]  But I'm on my tongue.
[4227.54s -> 4228.04s]  That's fine.
[4238.55s -> 4240.15s]  All right, so I don't know why.
[4240.15s -> 4242.15s]  So you guys know I've been doing a lot of doctor's appointments, right?
[4242.87s -> 4246.23s]  And at every single doctor's appointment, most of them check your vitals, right?
[4246.23s -> 4248.31s]  So they'll check your temperature.
[4248.31s -> 4250.87s]  They'll say, okay, let's do your blood pressure.
[4250.87s -> 4252.23s]  Let's sit down for a second.
[4252.23s -> 4253.51s]  Let's check your weight and all that, right?
[4254.23s -> 4256.55s]  So I don't know why, but I've had my blood pressure checked
[4257.35s -> 4263.35s]  like dozens of times, like probably 20 fucking times in the last six months, right?
[4264.55s -> 4266.07s]  For this, for some reason now,
[4266.71s -> 4268.71s]  like the last doctor's appointment I went to,
[4269.59s -> 4272.95s]  I was getting the, it was an automatic machine.
[4273.99s -> 4278.47s]  And while it was going on, while she came out, she put it on, she pressed the button.
[4279.35s -> 4280.95s]  I started laughing so hard.
[4280.95s -> 4281.67s]  I couldn't help it.
[4281.67s -> 4284.15s]  I couldn't stop because it was crushing me.
[4284.15s -> 4285.91s]  It was really, really uncomfortable.
[4285.91s -> 4288.71s]  And the reason why I was laughing so hard is because
[4289.80s -> 4291.72s]  you guys have seen the Beavis and Butthead episode
[4292.44s -> 4295.96s]  where Beavis and Butthead are at like CVS or something.
[4297.34s -> 4299.74s]  Beavis puts his arm in that thing and they think it's a ride.
[4300.94s -> 4303.98s]  And he's trying, he's, it starts going on his arm and crushing him.
[4303.98s -> 4306.22s]  And he starts freaking the fuck out because he doesn't know what it is.
[4307.26s -> 4310.36s]  I was sitting there just thinking about Beavis and how I was like
[4310.36s -> 4311.80s]  acting, kind of thinking that way.
[4311.80s -> 4314.12s]  I was like, oh my God, I'm getting the fuck out of this.
[4314.12s -> 4319.64s]  And I just, and they're laughing and I, I can't tell like the nurse why I'm laughing.
[4320.28s -> 4322.04s]  Like, oh, what's, what's, is that funny?
[4322.76s -> 4323.56s]  Yeah.
[4324.36s -> 4328.12s]  Everyone Beavis like freaks out and his like face starts turning purple
[4328.12s -> 4329.88s]  because he had this thing put on his arm.
[4329.88s -> 4330.44s]  Remember that?
[4331.58s -> 4332.06s]  Oh yeah.
[4332.06s -> 4332.94s]  You, okay.
[4332.94s -> 4333.74s]  Let me write that down.
[4334.62s -> 4341.93s]  I was, I don't know why I just started thinking about it.
[4342.89s -> 4343.77s]  I couldn't stop.
[4351.21s -> 4352.65s]  It was really tight though.
[4353.21s -> 4356.44s]  Like Beavis and Butthead comedy type.
[4356.44s -> 4361.94s]  I hit all three of these buttons, right?
[4364.44s -> 4365.56s]  You're a loon.
[4365.56s -> 4368.18s]  Bro, I don't think I am.
[4368.74s -> 4378.15s]  Do you, hey, hey, hey.
[4378.15s -> 4379.27s]  You think I'm a loon?
[4381.11s -> 4382.39s]  One in chat, if yes.
[4382.39s -> 4383.27s]  Two in chat, if no.
[4384.71s -> 4385.67s]  You think I'm a loon?
[4398.39s -> 4399.35s]  Can I buy costumes?
[4404.62s -> 4406.44s]  Okay.
[4406.44s -> 4407.16s]  Where's the last one?
[4408.04s -> 4408.92s]  Oh, there it is.
[4409.72s -> 4416.89s]  Bart, Bart.
[4417.69s -> 4421.18s]  I have a question.
[4421.98s -> 4426.38s]  Is like the Bart thing going to turn into like Johnny Depp?
[4426.38s -> 4430.86s]  Is just Johnny Depp being a parody of himself as Captain Jack Sparrow
[4430.86s -> 4431.98s]  because he's done it so many times?
[4433.29s -> 4434.09s]  Is that going to happen to me?
[4434.09s -> 4435.05s]  Like, is that happening to me?
[4442.18s -> 4445.46s]  Like, like it's no longer Johnny Depp doing Captain Jack Sparrow.
[4445.46s -> 4448.18s]  It's just Johnny Depp pretending to be Captain Jack Sparrow.
[4448.18s -> 4449.54s]  It's not actually Captain Jack Sparrow.
[4449.54s -> 4451.14s]  Do you guys know what I'm talking about when I mean that?
[4451.14s -> 4451.78s]  When I say that?
[4452.66s -> 4458.06s]  You know, like it feels real.
[4458.06s -> 4461.51s]  It feels like it's, it feels like just acting.
[4461.51s -> 4463.03s]  Somebody knows what I mean by that, right?
[4463.03s -> 4465.59s]  Like it's, it's like Johnny Depp is like doing a parody
[4466.15s -> 4468.39s]  almost of himself when he's doing it now.
[4468.39s -> 4469.19s]  Does that make any sense?
[4477.74s -> 4478.38s]  Absolutely.
[4478.38s -> 4478.78s]  Thank you.
[4481.35s -> 4482.39s]  Thank you one guy.
[4483.19s -> 4485.59s]  All right.
[4485.59s -> 4486.39s]  So what did that do for me?
[4487.64s -> 4488.20s]  Oh, Patrick.
[4488.76s -> 4490.49s]  Nobody said that.
[4490.49s -> 4490.73s]  Yeah.
[4490.73s -> 4491.61s]  At least 10 people did.
[4492.25s -> 4502.50s]  Germa Johnny Depp.
[4502.50s -> 4503.46s]  Germa what?
[4503.46s -> 4505.30s]  Hey, SpongeBob.
[4506.10s -> 4511.72s]  Your cherry picking responses.
[4511.72s -> 4513.16s]  Thank goodness you're safe, Patrick.
[4517.45s -> 4519.29s]  Well, of course, SpongeBob.
[4519.29s -> 4520.25s]  Why wouldn't I be?
[4521.53s -> 4523.77s]  Only pull out the ones that agree with you and don't
[4523.77s -> 4527.13s]  and just ignore the sea of people that disagree.
[4528.17s -> 4530.47s]  Did you guys think I'm right?
[4531.37s -> 4536.73s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes.
[4536.73s -> 4537.29s]  No, no.
[4537.29s -> 4538.09s]  Oh, you think I'm right.
[4538.09s -> 4538.33s]  Thanks.
[4538.33s -> 4538.49s]  Cool.
[4538.49s -> 4539.05s]  Thank you.
[4539.05s -> 4539.29s]  Cool.
[4540.33s -> 4541.13s]  I know I am.
[4550.68s -> 4552.20s]  Patrick, I tell you what.
[4552.20s -> 4554.44s]  All that running around has left me pooped.
[4554.44s -> 4556.28s]  Why don't you continue on for a bit?
[4556.28s -> 4557.08s]  You literally do that.
[4557.08s -> 4558.28s]  You have an emote about it.
[4560.28s -> 4568.63s]  Where's.
[4570.07s -> 4571.03s]  I'm Patrick now.
[4576.74s -> 4582.81s]  can he fly? I feel like he can fly. No. Don't you think he can lie down flat like a starfish
[4582.81s -> 4594.17s]  and glide or spin and glide? This is a throw fruit. Patrick can pick up a throw fruit and throw
[4594.17s -> 4603.99s]  them. Press the B button to pick up a nearby throw fruit. Okay. Use it quickly. It wilts after a few
[4603.99s -> 4624.52s]  seconds. How far can you throw it? That was a bad example. Oh, there's a lock on. Patrick can also
[4624.52s -> 4629.40s]  pick up and throw tiki's, but only tiki's that don't have other tiki's stacked on top of them.
[4630.12s -> 4650.20s]  How do I throw to that guy? So shiny. Patrick can throw fruit up steps. What's happening?
[4650.20s -> 4654.84s]  And climb the steps, pick up the fruit and throw it again. But he better hurt before it wilts.
[4663.99s -> 4686.39s]  Real voice. No, it wasn't. Morty. Real Morty. Oh, fuck. I didn't read. Okay. You can throw stuff.
[4687.93s -> 4693.03s]  Read. This is a thunder tiki. When Patrick touches it, it will begin to storm and after a few
[4693.03s -> 4701.29s]  seconds it will go boom. Don't be near it when it goes boom. How many pairs of underwear does
[4701.29s -> 4718.58s]  Patrick have? The same. I feel like these are here for a reason. Oh, whoops. Okay. Anything else over
[4718.58s -> 4731.86s]  her? Oh, I can read it. This is a special Patrick teeter totter that only Patrick can use. Okay.
[4731.86s -> 4744.09s]  That's a really important point. SpongeBob can't use this shit. He didn't notice. Why is everybody
[4744.09s -> 4757.16s]  jabbing? Patrick, keepo. Keepo happy. Okay. Who's your, who, are you ready? Who's your favorite
[4757.16s -> 4777.80s]  SpongeBob character? I'll tell you mine after you tell me yours. Okay. Okay.
[4777.80s -> 4781.66s]  Okay. I'm seeing a lot of, yeah, I'm seeing a lot of things that I would do.
[4781.66s -> 4785.02s]  Oh, hi there, Mr. Plankton. Are you going to vaporize me today?
[4786.58s -> 4794.50s]  So very tempting. Unfortunately, I found myself in the undesirable position of having to assist you.
[4796.10s -> 4802.42s]  The guy that screams, yeah. I was in an undesirable position yesterday and now my neck hurts.
[4803.86s -> 4807.54s]  Which Looney Tune Daffy Duck would I be? That's easy. Which Looney Tune character would you be
[4807.54s -> 4814.90s]  Daffy Duck? Or the Road Runner because I'm really fast and explosive. Either one. Combine them.
[4820.98s -> 4832.20s]  Not anymore. No, maybe not. Go into Jellyfish Cave, follow the instructions and sign.
[4833.08s -> 4837.08s]  At the end of the caves, you'll still be a big idiot, but you'll know enough to help
[4837.08s -> 4844.41s]  defeat the robots. Well, then will you vaporize me? I might spare your life so I can force you
[4844.41s -> 4850.33s]  to work in my sweatshop, making low quality design and knock off wallets. Oh, thank you.
[4853.56s -> 4862.25s]  The intel is his favorite character. Road Runner. Oh, for SpongeBob. Right. Have you guys ever seen
[4862.25s -> 4867.37s]  a Road Runner in real life? They are the most, they're the best favorite bird on earth. They're
[4867.37s -> 4874.95s]  the most cute little funny little guys. They're amazing. They're so cool. The way they run,
[4874.95s -> 4880.73s]  they got those funny little mohawks. They're little, they're not huge. They're fast. They
[4880.73s -> 4891.90s]  go like 25 miles per hour. They're fast. Oh, stalling, stalling. Oh, right, right. Favorite
[4891.90s -> 4900.47s]  SpongeBob character. It's free season five. It's going to be Patrick. Post season six,
[4901.27s -> 4918.73s]  it's going to be Mr. Krabs. That's a, that's, that's a really hot take, dude. What the
[4918.73s -> 4922.17s]  fuck is he saying? I'm talking about my favorite SpongeBob characters. The four seasons,
[4923.13s -> 4929.00s]  whatever the early one I said, Patrick's my favorite character. And then after season five,
[4929.72s -> 4945.19s]  after season five, it's Mr. Krabs. I just think he's funny. Don't watch past season four. See,
[4945.19s -> 4952.47s]  I don't agree with that. I know, I know that like the first four or five seasons were like just way
[4952.47s -> 4963.70s]  better. I know they were. And then like after like season 10, it was like, okay, I do this twice.
[4967.38s -> 4975.35s]  This joke is as salvageable as the Titanic. Talking about who my favorite
[4975.35s -> 4987.14s]  character in SpongeBob is. That's, wait, what? That's, that's a, what do you mean joke?
[4997.06s -> 5002.86s]  Season one came out when you were like 20. I don't know. I mean, just do the math. Yeah.
[5003.02s -> 5010.20s]  Something like that. I thought it was great. I can't jump. I can't jump. Hold on. Can I throw
[5010.20s -> 5028.95s]  this? How far can I throw this? Give it to me. Come on. Dan here. He just fell. This dude's
[5028.95s -> 5043.29s]  fucking ancient. Sorry, I'm over 30. Fuck. What's happening? I, what, so what happens when I turn?
[5044.17s -> 5052.81s]  Like, all right, you get out of here. Like I'm paying attention. I don't care about anything
[5052.81s -> 5066.50s]  right now. Hold on. That's what I wanted to do. Here we are. Thank you. That's much better.
[5067.30s -> 5079.11s]  When are you going to do new emotes? No, I don't think I'm ever going to give a date for that
[5079.11s -> 5083.59s]  because I keep saying I'm going to make new emotes and then a year goes by and nothing happens.
[5084.71s -> 5091.35s]  I just like massive spam went through a bunch of stuff on a better Twitch because I was like,
[5091.35s -> 5109.66s]  yeah, let's just add like 10 of them. We're so lonely. There will be.
[5110.78s -> 5116.97s]  I don't know. The way to throw fruit will also activate pressure plates. Okay, cool.
[5121.38s -> 5131.54s]  Now I can run through, but wait. Yeah, whatever. Patrick can also jump up on a throw fruit to get
[5131.54s -> 5136.18s]  to higher places. You may stack throw fruits as well by throwing a throw fruit on top of another
[5136.18s -> 5141.54s]  throw fruit to allow Patrick to get to even higher places. Well, don't they, don't they have to wait
[5141.54s -> 5173.96s]  respond? Does that not matter right now? This is kind of how, it's just kind of how I feel
[5174.52s -> 5179.18s]  like 40% of every day. Can I tell you that? Not like that. Not like that. Not like that. Not like
[5179.18s -> 5225.50s]  that. Not like that. Okay, let's play. Let's throw them this way. No, the lock. I can still do it.
[5228.76s -> 5267.67s]  Good work. Oh, I didn't know this is a slide. I'm lost. I want to spend some of this. Oh wait,
[5267.67s -> 5273.67s]  Patrick can drink this, right? This is a freeze fruit. Patrick's favorite. They can throw it.
[5274.79s -> 5283.94s]  Freeze goo. You can slide on it until it thaws. Let's take a look. Well, that's interesting.
[5284.74s -> 5289.45s]  Do it again in a minute. I'm gonna go up there first. Oh, spatula.
[5290.25s -> 5300.74s]  Patrick's belly flops into your robots. He can damage or stun them. That's awesome.
[5302.42s -> 5307.46s]  It's the same sound effects as Spyro. It was the same team. Maybe it was the same team.
[5311.40s -> 5317.64s]  Powered. That is pretty well powered actually. That's much better. It was the same death team.
[5318.44s -> 5335.78s]  That's pretty cool. Patrick may even pick up robots he has stunned and throw them into other
[5335.78s -> 5357.77s]  robots. Oh, well, I crushed him. Almost happened. I want to try it. All right, well, that's you.
[5358.65s -> 5405.64s]  You're too close. All right, that thing was small. That's cool, but when am I ever going to
[5406.20s -> 5419.45s]  use that besides rolling into a bucket? Oh, well, that didn't even do what I thought it was going
[5419.45s -> 5443.38s]  to do. And spatula. This game sucks. It doesn't. It really doesn't. It's fine. This game does not
[5443.38s -> 5456.33s]  suck. Wait, I want to do the ice thing. This may in fact be the last great licensed video game. Is
[5456.33s -> 5472.66s]  that true? Could be. That accurate? No. What was the last great licensed video game based on like
[5473.22s -> 5479.66s]  a cartoon or a TV show or a movie? I'm not sure I count comic books right now.
[5482.20s -> 5489.72s]  It's like Batman, Spider-Man. I'm talking about like TV show. Just based on a TV show.
[5490.44s -> 5495.88s]  Not on like an iconic character that's been around in like comic books and shit for like 50 years.
[5497.34s -> 5501.50s]  Batman's been around for a very long time. I'm talking like solely like a licensed movie
[5501.50s -> 5507.99s]  video game or a licensed TV show video game. You don't count it because it answers it. No,
[5507.99s -> 5515.05s]  because I gave separate criteria like TV show only. Spider-Man wasn't a TV show for like 30 years
[5515.77s -> 5524.90s]  before. Wait, what? What did Spider-Man get invented? Probably South Park. I mean,
[5524.90s -> 5547.03s]  it's a signed Seinfeld Samurai Jack game. Is that good? What? Okay, why so many people just said it
[5547.03s -> 5567.69s]  and then now so many people are saying no. There's a purple one over there. These guys talk.
[5571.91s -> 5583.10s]  I'm good. Got what I wanted. South Park games have been good and weirdly enough I never gave
[5583.10s -> 5589.14s]  either one of them a chance and I always knew that they were good. Don't ask me why. I don't know.
[5593.00s -> 5601.05s]  Ahoy there. Squidward tells me you're looking for the king jellyfish. Here we are. Yes. Good thing
[5601.05s -> 5606.57s]  too. That monster has been stinging all my good customers in their poop decks. I hear that you
[5606.57s -> 5611.93s]  can find him up top of Old Sport Mountain here. Shark Tank? Go hook that beast, sailor. Dude,
[5611.93s -> 5617.53s]  I would love a Shark Tank video game even if it was dog shit. You know how much fun that would be?
[5619.51s -> 5623.83s]  Why didn't they make that for the Wii? Imagine with the Wii mode and shit you make like a product
[5623.83s -> 5629.35s]  and it would be like shitty 3D rendered Mark Cuban. I wanted that. I want that for the Wii,
[5629.35s -> 5637.94s]  like a 2005 version of that game. Shark Tank didn't exist in 2005. Why not? Oh boy, Mr. Krabs,
[5637.94s -> 5646.20s]  I'll see what I can do. Like I'm talking about I want Mark Cuban to be rendered in the terrain
[5646.20s -> 5651.48s]  editor. Not even like the model. You know I want like a pure just like old fucking shitty 3D video
[5651.48s -> 5690.98s]  game. Boss fight. This whole body was chattering but not his tongue. You're not going to take all
[5690.98s -> 5710.95s]  my 3882 coins are you? No you just killed. That was he was not even a big deal. Oh it's this guy.
[5710.95s -> 5715.45s]  This guy's my favorite character in Spongebob. I remember this. Yeah this guy's my favorite. You
[5715.45s -> 5720.81s]  know why? Because this guy always reminded me of those little aliens from the Jim Henson Muffet
[5720.81s -> 5726.71s]  shit. The guys that go like yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep that's my favorite
[5726.71s -> 5743.74s]  character. I just didn't know what his name was. It was guy with huge folding down mouth.
[5744.46s -> 5755.88s]  Hello Mrs. Puff. Hello Patrick. I've got a job for you to do. Oh boy. Actually it could be it could
[5755.88s -> 5761.48s]  be Mrs. Puff. I found a golden spatula. Yeah it might be Mrs. Puff. I stole it and threw it into
[5761.48s -> 5765.88s]  the lake. Yeah no I changed my answer. It's Mrs. Puff. That's my favorite character. You're welcome
[5765.88s -> 5787.91s]  to it. I remember she's so fun. Showing off Mrs. Puff. She doesn't do anything. She's actually one
[5787.91s -> 5796.28s]  of the only characters in the entire series that is very concerned with how fucking how Spongebob
[5796.28s -> 5816.66s]  like breaks shit and hurts people. The only character in the whole series. This farm? What
[5816.66s -> 5823.80s]  about Squidward? I think Squidward's just irritated that he exists and like hates him because he
[5823.80s -> 5830.76s]  exists. I'm not sure Squidward's ever concerned about anything he does. I think he just hates
[5830.76s -> 5837.64s]  him. It's never like ah Spongebob why did you do that? Let me tell you some ways that you could
[5837.64s -> 5844.12s]  do that differently instead of throwing my fluid into the dumpster. No he's just like you're an idiot
[5844.12s -> 5851.38s]  I hate you. Mrs. Puff is like Spongebob did you hit the break? Just slowly my friend. Like he
[5851.38s -> 5864.90s]  Mrs. Puff tries to help him. Oh um well uh no. What am I supposed to do? Did you get the golden
[5864.90s -> 5869.06s]  spatula back from the robots on the island? Okay robots on the island get the spatula from the
[5869.06s -> 5887.06s]  robots on the island. You got it. I have to get I have to kill that. Oh I know what to do. Throw the
[5887.06s -> 5901.18s]  nuke. Get double tapped? Fun. I don't think Spongebob's underwear fits Squidward right.
[5903.74s -> 5925.85s]  Wait should I? Hmm I haven't thought of that. Farming. Can I not reach from there?
[5926.81s -> 5939.35s]  Do I have to just just destroy all the buildings? I can't reach from here. Use the guard breaker.
[5941.43s -> 5955.56s]  Dude you're killing me. Oh just kill me right because these are robots that are they just
[5957.08s -> 5962.52s]  just kill me like organic or just kill kill me into a robot too. I made a whole game about this.
[5962.52s -> 5983.13s]  I played it. How do I get over this? Can I not throw them? Wait a minute should I? Throwing.
[5983.21s -> 6006.46s]  Should I just walk around and throw it at that? I can't reach from there. I oh I can get them on
[6006.46s -> 6020.84s]  the bridge. Children's game. Children's game. Children's game. Children's game. Children's game.
[6020.84s -> 6034.66s]  Children's game. Children's game. Children's game. Lost in children's game. Sorry children's game.
[6034.66s -> 6052.87s]  It's still there. The Simpsons hit and run all over again. No it's not. This is gonna be like
[6053.83s -> 6062.73s]  have I ever played a game like this before? I don't think I have. Wait what was that game
[6062.73s -> 6078.66s]  that was Yooka-Laylee? Yooka-Laylee. Oh Mario Sunshine. Yeah yeah I didn't play Mario Odyssey
[6078.66s -> 6088.66s]  on stream. Played it a little bit off stream and by the way let me tell you oh perfect don't listen
[6088.66s -> 6095.51s]  to what that guy said to you like two hours ago. No. That's much better. I'm gonna go.
[6096.23s -> 6103.29s]  I'm gonna go this way. Well done Patrick. You're a real star.
[6104.89s -> 6116.92s]  Can I get a cookie? No. Swap characters. Oh I guess I don't feel like playing with um Patrick
[6116.92s -> 6121.94s]  anymore. This is a shticky. SpongeBob will have to sneak up on it in order to destroy it.
[6124.04s -> 6132.73s]  Ah okay. Patrick may throw things at it from a distance. Well let's change back to SpongeBob.
[6132.89s -> 6143.02s]  It's a sneak.
[6165.19s -> 6196.58s]  That's what they see. You know what I mean? Like I bite him. Bite him. He's coming. SpongeBob's
[6196.58s -> 6226.12s]  a little less strong. Dude you're unhinged. Shit. Wait there's something up there. There are
[6226.12s -> 6232.26s]  underwear up there. I yeah I'm gonna go get that stuff. Put on Doom OST. You want me to
[6232.26s -> 6235.54s]  replace SpongeBob music with Doom OST? Now here comes a real fight in the chat.
[6236.50s -> 6253.29s]  This is gonna get interesting I think. I feel like a new sponge. That would be funny. Put it
[6253.29s -> 6275.91s]  though. Oh I'm not sure that would be very funny. Absolutely funny. SpongeBob should come back here
[6275.91s -> 6286.76s]  later when he knows the crew's bubble move. Oh I don't know the crew's bubble move. What the hell am
[6286.76s -> 6297.53s]  I supposed to do? He's vetoing it. Oh that already did. That already happened. That was vetoed when I
[6297.53s -> 6323.40s]  read the D in Doom OST. It's very relaxing. Okay I want to get that sock. It goes all the way around.
[6324.28s -> 6336.33s]  Okay let's ask you to keep moving. It kind of worked. This is not relaxing at all.
[6337.21s -> 6352.10s]  You don't think this is relaxing? You don't think so? Did I go on the wall? Where did I go?
[6366.71s -> 6369.51s]  You've never been like sitting on the beach and this is just kind of playing?
[6370.71s -> 6373.27s]  Stuff like this is just like that's like that's what they're playing on the beach.
[6383.30s -> 6395.30s]  No no no. But you've never gone to any restaurant or a little bar on the beach?
[6396.02s -> 6402.98s]  They all play this music. Everyone just looks around and goes like yeah yeah. You get a big
[6402.98s -> 6407.78s]  like sip of the drink. Yeah. You just nod your head the whole time that you're in there.
[6408.98s -> 6424.81s]  No they don't. Yeah they do. I've been in the same room when this happened. You take the sip of your
[6424.81s -> 6432.25s]  big drink with the umbrella in it. You know the big like big shoe drink. It's a huge glass like
[6432.25s -> 6457.69s]  shoe thing. This is a stone Tiki. That's what you know. Can I tell you? Stone is one of my favorite
[6457.69s -> 6466.15s]  words. Cannot be destroyed with ordinary moves. It can be blown up by thunder Tiki. Beach in Vegas.
[6466.15s -> 6471.27s]  Guys I'm I'm 34 years old. You don't think I've ever been to a beach before with a drink in my
[6471.27s -> 6476.31s]  like on the on like the beach waterfront or like a beach restaurant before up when I'm in my like
[6476.31s -> 6488.54s]  early 20s. As long as these pants are square and this sponge is bob I will not let Bikini Bottom
[6488.54s -> 6496.86s]  down. You don't think I've ever been to a beach restaurant where it's like oh we have this like
[6496.86s -> 6507.90s]  little beach drink. Oh I'll take one. And the person that you're across from you go try this.
[6507.90s -> 6514.42s]  Try. And both of you take a sip of each other's like drinks. You go like oh whoa this is what he
[6514.42s -> 6522.42s]  got. And then you never go back ever for the rest of your fucking life. You never go back
[6522.42s -> 6552.98s]  to this restaurant or bar ever again. Get him. We got that one wrong. Holy shit that's a lot of
[6552.98s -> 6566.42s]  stone in there. That's a lot of stone in there. I want to see it. Yes. 150 bucks open this.
[6567.30s -> 6578.70s]  Is that worth doing? I only have 6,700. Do I watch Veggie Tales? No I never did.
[6584.49s -> 6603.91s]  Veggie Tales for me was just Alvin and the Chipmunks but scary. And this is somebody that's an avid
[6603.91s -> 6609.59s]  listener of Alvin and the Chipmunks. And by avid listener I mean that every time an Alvin and the
[6609.59s -> 6614.31s]  Chipmunk song ever came on the radio it was immediately being turned down four or five
[6614.31s -> 6620.31s]  notches on the volume. That's how you know an Alvin and the Chipmunk song has come on the radio.
[6621.19s -> 6642.71s]  You immediately drop the button. I'm dead. You're not a Christian. Aren't you a Christian?
[6643.35s -> 6664.94s]  What do you think? Who told you that? Oh this is Patrick. Okay there's never been one time on
[6664.94s -> 6670.70s]  stream where I've been like and guys I want to make sure everyone knows I'm a I'm a Christian.
[6672.07s -> 6691.62s]  I don't whatever. I don't give a shit who you are. He said it. You're deranged. Okay hold on.
[6692.26s -> 6698.52s]  Oh I want the facts. I want the facts out here. So me just saying you know guys no I've never
[6698.52s -> 6703.48s]  mentioned that before. I'm not a Christian. I've never said that. He's fucking deranged.
[6704.44s -> 6728.95s]  Somebody wrap him up quick. Where's this uh thing spawning? Oh over there. He's getting political.
[6728.95s -> 6737.99s]  Cut the mic. Get my mic off. It's on forever. You know unless there's a power outage.
[6738.47s -> 6762.04s]  I told you that today was a weird one. I told you I was in a weird mood and I knew something.
[6762.04s -> 6769.16s]  I told you. I prepared you guys two hours ago. I did. I told you two hours ago. Right? I did.
[6769.16s -> 6794.76s]  I warned you. I can go to one of the new areas now. I can go downtown right? Holy shit. This is
[6794.76s -> 6801.86s]  such a random lol stream. He's so random. Thanks for saying that dude. I try so hard to be like
[6801.86s -> 6823.82s]  random. Does it work? Is it working? I need 10 of these right? I want to get up here. I gotta go
[6823.82s -> 6838.55s]  all the way around and there's another sock over there. Hulk burger nom nom. Oh boy. Now he's just
[6838.55s -> 6844.57s]  pandering. Oh you know what pandering looks like on this channel. I think that's what's happening
[6844.57s -> 6854.60s]  right now. I know what that's like. I know what that is. There's that sock all the way across.
[6855.24s -> 6866.09s]  Oh this is gonna be annoying. What the fuck? I knocked him to the other side.
[6880.36s -> 6890.94s]  Wait freeze this stuff. Shit I hate I hate when I have to come back as other characters.
[6890.94s -> 6897.02s]  There's so much content to do. What a fun game. What a great amount of content they've given me.
[6910.28s -> 6926.73s]  No. That's what happened to Donkey Kong 64. You know I'll be honest I really didn't play Donkey
[6926.81s -> 6935.62s]  Kong 64 really at all. I really didn't. How did I miss that? Remember hearing the emergency
[6935.62s -> 6939.54s]  broadcast thing? Like this is a test of the emergency broadcasting system. Did you just hear
[6939.54s -> 6964.54s]  that? I did. It's weird. I know that they do that all the time to test it and everything but holy
[6964.54s -> 6970.54s]  shit it doesn't scare the absolute hell out of you. I've been in the car before with like the radio on
[6971.26s -> 6973.82s]  and all of a sudden you're just like kind of oh the radio's just on this and
[6975.42s -> 6983.75s]  it's like what the fuck happened? And then you're sitting there waiting. You're waiting. You're
[6983.75s -> 6991.00s]  sitting. You're in the car and you're out of red light and you hear that like and you're sitting
[6991.00s -> 6995.16s]  there going uh oh okay what happened? And you're just kind of looking around waiting to see a
[6995.16s -> 7000.12s]  bunch of other cars just start fucking driving. That's how you know that they like got it first
[7000.12s -> 7006.22s]  or something. They like they're hearing it too. You're at a red light. You see like four cars just
[7006.22s -> 7009.18s]  start speeding away. It's like uh oh what's this what's this gonna say?
[7011.19s -> 7023.21s]  I think that they should really before doing that they should go like
[7024.17s -> 7029.94s]  excuse me just want to let you know that there's about to be a test of the emergency broadcast
[7029.94s -> 7047.75s]  system. Here it comes. Like I know here it comes right? I'm kind of going the wrong way aren't I?
[7047.75s -> 7052.71s]  They do it every time. No no no they make the loud noise first and then the guy comes on.
[7054.65s -> 7060.34s]  They make the and then the guy goes hey just letting you know. Here comes the test.
[7066.95s -> 7072.81s]  Where is the box? Back box idiot idiot. Where's it? Where is it though? I don't I don't remember
[7072.81s -> 7076.73s]  where it is. Where's it from here? You're going the wrong way. I know I'm trying to figure it out.
[7077.37s -> 7086.81s]  Play the actual sound. No no no I'm not doing that. I I think remember before like I don't think you
[7086.81s -> 7098.25s]  could do that. No no no I'm not doing it. No now I'm not gonna why am I gonna do that? I'm
[7098.25s -> 7109.14s]  not gonna play the emergency broadcast sound. Somebody will be in their bathroom and somebody
[7109.14s -> 7113.22s]  like went to go take a dump like fucking 30 minutes ago and they left the stream and now
[7113.22s -> 7117.30s]  they turn it back on and they hear that. Yeah I don't want to do that. No that's no that's
[7117.30s -> 7154.46s]  fucked up. I don't want to do that. Did I pick Patrick? How did I miss this? I'm also disappointed
[7154.46s -> 7159.66s]  that this is not. Hold on. Me not you. I'm disappointed that this is not. No why would
[7159.66s -> 7169.21s]  I be disappointed? I'm not gonna say what I was gonna say. Imagine only imagine only needing 30
[7169.21s -> 7176.81s]  minutes to dump. I'm not gonna be known as the guy that just talks about like going to the bathroom
[7176.81s -> 7193.29s]  every stream. We need at least one in between where I don't do that. Oh super monster combo.
[7194.17s -> 7199.03s]  I'm not gonna do the Diablo 3 thing where it just does that every time right?
[7199.03s -> 7208.12s]  Remember that? Remember Diablo 3? How cool that was the first like 2000 times it said
[7208.12s -> 7214.86s]  wow plus 200 experience bonus super ultra kill and how badly you just wanted to fucking turn
[7214.86s -> 7228.90s]  that off and never say that ever again. They never let you turn it off. Diablo 3 by the way
[7228.90s -> 7233.46s]  I'm not talking about Diablo 2. SpongeBob can jump up walls well then why would I be Patrick?
[7234.42s -> 7244.36s]  Sound like a broken man. Still been thinking about that setting I couldn't undo and I don't
[7244.36s -> 7261.34s]  know why I was supposed to say Mario 3. Yes I know SpongeBob can do it. All right SpongeBob let's go.
[7268.78s -> 7282.49s]  Cool. Care about the game he's playing. What are you talking about? I'm having a blast. I'm having a
[7282.49s -> 7308.18s]  great time. And look I got now I have 10 nine spatulas. There it was again. Who makes that noise?
[7308.18s -> 7315.32s]  It's the robots that do it? Oh shit this is King Jellyfish. His first major major encounter
[7315.32s -> 7331.99s]  of the game. Gosh everyone is trying to help out today. Look at that I know what he's doing.
[7331.99s -> 7339.51s]  Step quietly there that King Jellyfish is just up at the top of this path. Good luck you'll need it.
[7340.87s -> 7352.12s]  Thanks Bubble Buddy. I feel like a new sponge. All right here we go. Get on top of Bubba Mountain.
[7352.92s -> 7354.60s]  Actually it's huge.
[7354.60s -> 7374.26s]  I knew the King Jellyfish was big but who knew he had such a beautiful voice.
[7374.26s -> 7390.33s]  Slap him. Is any of this based on an episode or something that he's based on?
[7393.13s -> 7419.03s]  And you got to slap him in the head. Wait open this. I can't open that. There it is. Slap him again.
[7423.50s -> 7428.01s]  Like a spring breeze. He's gonna lose the King Jellyfish. No I will not.
[7428.01s -> 7444.58s]  I feel like a new sponge. Desperate grab. But how many Wiimotes does the jellyfish have too?
[7445.62s -> 7464.55s]  Who cares about the ads? Just kill the guy. Why is he getting so close?
[7464.95s -> 7470.10s]  Fast. Oh that was fast.
[7488.23s -> 7492.39s]  Peanut butter. I could go for some peanut butter right now. Peanut butter and flop sandwich.
[7494.23s -> 7497.35s]  Or a deconstructed peanut butter and flop sandwich.
[7498.31s -> 7502.79s]  Will you just take a spoon and you take a big spoonful of peanut butter put it in your mouth
[7502.79s -> 7508.04s]  and a big spoonful of fluff put it in your mouth. I did that. I still do that all the time.
[7509.08s -> 7515.26s]  You're 35 years old. What's wrong with eating peanut butter? Peanut butter is perfect.
[7515.90s -> 7523.61s]  I feel like a new sponge. All right so what does that thing do? Oh that's the jelly I needed.
[7524.57s -> 7531.58s]  Don't you don't say deconstructed.
[7533.50s -> 7544.98s]  Oh deconstructed. That makes me so happy. You're such a hipster. Wait this is like a
[7545.78s -> 7554.15s]  we're gonna get like a goodbye from the level. We're gonna be ready. Wait give me that one.
[7554.87s -> 7574.42s]  I got it. What the fuck is that? Hey there it looks like you'll have to make a huge
[7574.50s -> 7577.78s]  jump at the end of that ramp in order to reach that golden spatula.
[7578.66s -> 7585.80s]  Cowabunga. Wow that's a mighty big leap. I think I can do it. I can make it. A jump at the end of
[7585.80s -> 7628.49s]  that. At the end I can. Yep that's how he dies. SpongeBob's on like drugs. Oh no look where I am.
[7639.03s -> 7652.01s]  Run saved. Get the box. Get the box. Get the box. I got it. Okay I'm good. Open the box. I got it.
[7652.01s -> 7663.11s]  The stream is delayed. The stream is delayed. All right should I go at the end of
[7663.67s -> 7669.83s]  should I'm gonna see what happens at the very end of the whole thing. Turn somewhere. I mean look
[7669.83s -> 7680.71s]  at that. Where does this go? Does this wrap around? This wraps around. Okay here we go.
[7681.75s -> 7707.62s]  Thank you. Back to the main menu. Here you go Squidward.
[7707.62s -> 7723.37s]  Oh yeah I feel so much better. Can I rub some on? What if I just gave you this?
[7729.05s -> 7744.07s]  How many spatulas are in the game? 120? This is why I don't go outside ever. Is it 100?
[7745.10s -> 7756.34s]  That's kind of a lot. That's cool. Okay hold on. No no I'm gonna go check out the other zones. I
[7756.98s -> 7764.74s]  stick in one area the whole time. Please stop the music. But what if the music changes in a new area?
[7766.90s -> 7778.66s]  See the music. Look the music's already changed. Please stop. No I'm not going to turn the music
[7778.66s -> 7785.99s]  off. It's it's classic SpongeBob music. Okay this is all right. I have a question. Does it consume
[7785.99s -> 7789.99s]  them or do you just have to have them? I don't answer that. My question was already answered.
[7804.20s -> 7816.82s]  Goo Lagoon? Downtown or Goo Lagoon? Which one? That sounds more interesting.
[7821.59s -> 7830.58s]  Downtown? There's a lot of downtowns. Somebody said this is a concerning amount of missiles.
[7831.22s -> 7836.78s]  Okay we're at the bottom of the ocean right? Something really fucked up is going on up there.
[7837.34s -> 7841.56s]  This is some World War 3 type shit.
[7842.12s -> 7858.18s]  Downtown Bikini Bottom. Once a bustling metropolis. Now a debris covered crater.
[7858.90s -> 7867.82s]  Oh it's just debris? SpongeBob the robots are destroying Downtown Bikini Bottom. We have to
[7867.82s -> 7873.14s]  evacuate. Definitely favorite character for sure. All right but it's gonna take a while to get all
[7873.14s -> 7881.66s]  this dust. Not vacuum. Evacuate. We have to get everyone to safety. Evacue? Can we just load them
[7881.66s -> 7889.10s]  up in the boats? That won't do any good. Why not? Because the robots have taken all the steering
[7889.10s -> 7897.50s]  wheels. Couldn't we just drive in a straight line? No there are too many turns. Those fiends,
[7897.50s -> 7901.66s]  they thought of everything. Never fear Mrs Puff. I'll get those steering wheels back. True.
[7902.78s -> 7909.66s]  Why are we seeing? Why did I see even one true? SpongeBob if you're involved I always fear.
[7909.66s -> 7915.50s]  But I tell you what if you can pull this off I'll give you a golden spatula. Get all the wheels.
[7916.86s -> 7920.46s]  How about a driver's license instead? Nice try.
[7922.38s -> 7938.76s]  There's one and it's 11. I need 11 steering wheels. What else is over here?
[7940.22s -> 7944.86s]  By the way 15 spatulas gets me to the... This place takes place in Texas.
[7964.68s -> 7973.02s]  Oh wait. Explode. Blow up. Who's throwing trash cans at me? Who's throwing garbage cans at me?
[7973.02s -> 7993.50s]  Oh you. That was weird. That was kind of like... I didn't like that. That made me feel uncomfortable.
[7993.50s -> 8012.84s]  That was strange. Blow up. Oh wait I can get a sock from Patrick right?
[8020.54s -> 8031.88s]  Me too. I love opening presents too. Secret? Yep. Good call. Oop-wine sock.
[8035.77s -> 8047.77s]  Get that person out of here. Get that person out of here. Nobody said that? Yes they did.
[8048.82s -> 8055.29s]  Scroll up. Scroll up. I mean there's like over 9,000 people here. You're gonna have to scroll up a
[8055.29s -> 8071.98s]  little bit. Don't ever tell me I can't do anything. Because I can. I thought I could hit it back.
[8077.78s -> 8080.10s]  Why did I think I could hit it back? That's what I want to know.
[8085.69s -> 8102.04s]  Please. All right. Can I jump on the lamps? What happened? Oh he did it for me. Wait a minute.
[8103.66s -> 8123.85s]  Oh well that's neat. I'm gonna do that to all of them. One, two, three. Do it. Over here. Nice.
[8127.80s -> 8151.56s]  Do it again. Nice. Bachelor. I love it. I love it. I'm gonna die. Put on some pants.
[8152.20s -> 8159.50s]  I'll get them. They're all over the place. I'll collect them. Is there a drivable car?
[8159.50s -> 8168.92s]  Can I go over here? I already went over here.
[8172.39s -> 8177.75s]  SpongeBob doesn't have a license. We see him driving around every episode.
[8178.71s -> 8187.16s]  He's always driving around and like crashing and stuff isn't he? And doesn't Mrs. Puff sitting
[8187.16s -> 8192.92s]  there going like, SpongeBob you need to do me a quick favor and hit the brake. Right? That happens
[8192.92s -> 8207.88s]  all the time. This looks like cheese puff SpongeBob. You can roll but you can't do anything else.
[8208.90s -> 8215.26s]  Being hurt or pressing any button will change you back. What the hell?
[8219.94s -> 8262.49s]  Let's try that again. What? What are they doing? Thank god for Gary. No I want to be the SpongeBob.
[8267.08s -> 8278.92s]  Can I read? This robot is called G. Love. The best way to deal with him is to bubble bounce him from
[8278.92s -> 8294.92s]  above. Stop. I want to roll around. Whatever. I saved your life. Wait, did it again? That was
[8294.92s -> 8313.78s]  awesome. That was such an awesome move. All right. Don't touch the red stuff. Okay. Is it hot sauce?
[8315.13s -> 8328.68s]  Volcano sauce. Oh, there's a wheel. Wait. How would I press this? Brew. Cool. All right. Cool.
[8328.68s -> 8338.31s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What do I do? Let's roll around. Let them blow up. I think. Yeah.
[8347.19s -> 8349.99s]  I don't want to be the little ball anymore. Stop hitting them, Jeremy.
[8350.79s -> 8366.36s]  I know. I'm trying to listen. That was pretty sick. Oh, this bubble buddy. This door is locked
[8366.36s -> 8377.19s]  from the inside. Who would do such a thing? Psycho? SpongeBob ice cream from the ice cream truck
[8377.19s -> 8382.34s]  is the best ice cream. I agree. And that's not even what you said. I just said that after you.
[8383.22s -> 8397.82s]  I want to get up there. Watch this. Watch this. Ready? Are you guys watching?
[8397.82s -> 8405.70s]  Oh, wait. Don't watch this part. I go higher on the trampoline.
[8406.34s -> 8422.36s]  I get that from here. Hey, vaude watchers. Why don't you skip forward? Don't do that. You're
[8422.36s -> 8457.06s]  going to miss the best joke of the whole night. How does this go? What was the joke? I didn't do
[8457.06s -> 8464.34s]  it yet. I just said, if you skip. Most people, when they skip, they go like 20 minutes. They go
[8465.30s -> 8471.45s]  forward, forward, forward. And they go 10, 15, 20 minutes forward. You don't just go like 10
[8471.45s -> 8479.05s]  seconds forward. Who skips 10 seconds on like a more than three, four, five, six hour vaude?
[8496.71s -> 8506.95s]  I actually do. All right. I've got 10 K of these things. Can I dump them with the bag upside down
[8506.95s -> 8524.57s]  at the bank? What do I do with these? Buy weapons. Oh, that's cool. I'll give it to Mr. Krabs. I guess
[8524.57s -> 8539.42s]  I really haven't explored completely the hub world, have I? Give them to Mr. Krabs. I will in a minute.
[8539.98s -> 8552.15s]  I just like jumping around. It's fun. You can open up areas with them. Oh, that's cool.
[8556.17s -> 8568.46s]  I know how to get this open. Just make him angry. Oh, all right. Now what do I go from here? Kill
[8568.46s -> 8579.90s]  this guy. I'm at the joke waiting room. Oh shit. All right. Uh, okay. Let's think here. Think quick.
[8581.19s -> 8591.19s]  So, um, somebody said something about toothpaste, right? It's quick. Somebody said like a toothbrush.
[8591.19s -> 8595.43s]  The guy from like 1700s having a toothpaste with sand in his mouth. Somebody say, somebody do
[8595.43s -> 8602.68s]  something like that. Quick. I'm in a lot of trouble here. You'll have to open this door.
[8603.48s -> 8621.90s]  How do I get up there? Open this door from the inside. How do I do that? What? That's all it did is
[8621.90s -> 8631.22s]  close the door. It closed the... No bag. It just closes the door. It closed the window.
[8636.31s -> 8653.88s]  I thought that was it. I thought I was ready. I'm gonna be the ball. Let's go be the ball. Okay. I am
[8653.88s -> 8665.06s]  ball. That's 2100 fucking points. That's worth it, right? 2100? That's a lot that I get. There's
[8665.06s -> 8681.67s]  nothing in here. There was nothing in there. Oh, it opened the gate. Fod watchers skip. No, no, no,
[8681.67s -> 8689.05s]  no, no. I'll know if you skip. I'll know if you skip it. I'll draw it down. I'll know. I'll know
[8689.05s -> 8717.24s]  who did it. Fod watchers run. That's like the equivalent of, okay, how many times per minute
[8717.80s -> 8724.58s]  do you guys think that somebody types into Google? Does somebody know if I unfollow them?
[8727.32s -> 8733.21s]  Does somebody know if they see your... Does somebody know if you see their tweet? How many
[8733.21s -> 8749.69s]  times a second do you think that's typed into Google? If I have read receipts off,
[8749.69s -> 8766.76s]  will people still know I saw their text? Quick rewind.
[8766.76s -> 8783.51s]  Oh, that gap looks big. Okay. I'm definitely not making that jump. How is anyone going to get
[8783.51s -> 8797.75s]  across there? New character? Oh, more robots. Looks impossible. Okay. Okay. I'll go get Sandy
[8797.75s -> 8812.60s]  to help me out. Where's Sandy? I don't know where Sandy lives. Oh shit. I need to have watched the
[8812.60s -> 8835.00s]  show. No, I actually don't know. I know that Spongebob, Patrick, and Squidward are neighbors.
[8835.96s -> 8849.46s]  I don't know where Sandy lives. I know that she's in a dome somewhere. Did she just get off the
[8849.46s -> 8865.62s]  bus? She just gets off the bus. Okay. Well, that makes it way easier. All right. Let's go jump to
[8865.62s -> 8872.86s]  the top of these steps. Sandy can glide across the gap to the next rooftop by double jumping
[8872.86s -> 8900.79s]  and holding A. Nice. I don't think I'll ever not play with Sandy. Double jump and a glide? Oh wait.
[8900.79s -> 8911.51s]  I love it. I love the jump too. Jump looks exactly like those... There's a toy. There's a toy. I don't
[8911.51s -> 8915.83s]  know what it is. What toy is this? It's like a little string and you pull the string up from the
[8915.91s -> 8920.07s]  top of the head and it goes... All the legs and arms come up and down. What am I talking about?
[8920.07s -> 8932.14s]  What is it? An old wooden toy. It's a toy that's like wood. It's a depression era toy. Yes. What
[8932.14s -> 8953.11s]  is it called? Called a barrel man. Are you lying? No, this is not... What the... This is not it. No.
[8953.11s -> 8965.67s]  It's a wooden toy that has string and legs and arms move up. What is this thing? Jumping jack.
[8965.67s -> 8981.69s]  There it is. Thank you. It's like a... Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It goes like this. Don't leave.
[8983.93s -> 8992.38s]  You're hovering over the X. Just stay. It's okay. All right. You're just like... You were about to
[8992.38s -> 9006.12s]  click and I stopped you. Just wait. Skip 10 seconds. Hey, what's up? Just want to make sure
[9006.12s -> 9013.22s]  that you actually did what I told you to do. Now, if you want to be cool and we can be like,
[9013.94s -> 9017.86s]  you know, but like a big community here, I'd like for you to skip an hour and 10 minutes
[9018.94s -> 9034.54s]  and I'll see you there for a sacred surprise. Skip an hour and 10 minutes. It's going to be fun.
[9034.54s -> 9052.60s]  What's that exact time though? It'll be 3... It'll be 3.42. 3.42. All right. Where am I going?
[9054.04s -> 9065.98s]  We can't skip when it's live. This isn't for you. This is for the Vod Watchers.
[9073.64s -> 9082.49s]  Right. Does she have something? Sandy can do a chop attack by pressing X. If you chop while in
[9082.49s -> 9101.34s]  the air, you will perform a karate kick. Okay. Cool. Wait, what? Sandy can lasso the object by
[9101.34s -> 9108.94s]  pressing B. So, tutorial, what you're telling me is Sandy is the best character in the game.
[9108.94s -> 9119.82s]  She just has every awesome move. Sandy can swing from a swing hook by pressing B.
[9124.28s -> 9134.78s]  I don't like it. It didn't say hold B. It said press B. It said press B, not hold B.
[9134.78s -> 9146.92s]  B. Press B, not, hey, hold it. It didn't say that. Now, what do I do now?
[9147.80s -> 9175.03s]  And she turned into a ball. Shit. Wait. Blow this up. That makes me so mad. I want to like
[9175.03s -> 9183.62s]  leave the level. Fuck. No, I can't leave the level. I think I just fucking glitched the game
[9183.62s -> 9196.82s]  out to get that one. It's right over there, you baby. Is it? What? Dude, you just call me baby?
[9197.54s -> 9226.66s]  What else can I get with this? It is right here. I need to get back up there. You enjoy halo.
[9228.23s -> 9237.35s]  Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. All right. I'm paying attention now.
[9237.35s -> 9256.62s]  Everyone's yelling at me. Where's the trampoline? Remember, you're just crying. You're crying.
[9257.18s -> 9291.16s]  Oddwatches, skip whole stream. How would you do that? The stream is sick. All right. We're back.
[9291.72s -> 9315.70s]  Which way is correct? Which is the right way? The stream is infected. So again, hold it. That's
[9315.70s -> 9325.42s]  actually kind of fun. He's got it under control. Sandy can lasso a rope up at pressing B. Sandy's
[9325.42s -> 9350.98s]  the best. Watch out, explodes. Good point now. Where do I go from here is the question.
[9351.54s -> 9370.31s]  We've got the whole area. Oh boy. There we are. Yes. This is a fake Sandy. I don't think it is.
[9370.31s -> 9389.96s]  I think this is real. I will destroy this though. Just get out of here and I'll get one of these.
[9393.53s -> 9419.42s]  Five. Well, anything else I can do from here? I go into the tuba. Holy shit, you can.
[9420.78s -> 9430.15s]  No, you can't. Oh, damn it. I thought you could. Honestly, that was cool. And Sandy's best
[9430.15s -> 9448.34s]  character in the whole game. So I've unlocked Sandy. You have to press R. I thought you'd win.
[9456.22s -> 9464.06s]  I need to have someone replace my old antenna with this shiny new one. So call cable company.
[9464.86s -> 9470.30s]  Yes, sir. That fair antenna is shinier than a three dollar bill. Well, why don't you replace
[9470.30s -> 9479.30s]  it yourself? I'm not really much of a jumper. So what's jumping got to do with it? Because the
[9479.38s -> 9480.90s]  old antenna is up there.
[9490.68s -> 9495.40s]  Which is gross, by the way. I just want to make sure I make my opinion on that very well heard.
[9495.40s -> 9500.04s]  The robots have blocked off that building and I can't do all those fancy moves you and Spongebob
[9500.04s -> 9508.81s]  do to get across these gaps. All I can do is flex. Want to see? Great. So what are you going to do
[9508.81s -> 9516.22s]  with the old antenna? I fucking hate ice tea with tons of sugar. I hate it.
[9525.27s -> 9529.91s]  There's a lot of sweet tea can get to a point where it's like syrup. It's not even a drink.
[9531.77s -> 9535.61s]  Like you could pour sweet tea over pancakes and that would be OK. That's a lot.
[9536.25s -> 9553.13s]  Sandy may cross the large gas by double jumping and holding a. Yeah, I know.
[9554.09s -> 9573.21s]  Or the candy bottom motor company. But I like ice tea. I like ice tea that should sweet with
[9573.21s -> 9579.48s]  sugar in it. Sweet tea is at a whole nother level. It's just it's just too much.
[9586.49s -> 9596.17s]  It's just killed that person. Swing. Hey, I can't. I'm trying to read swing from swing from sweet.
[9599.08s -> 9609.72s]  I know. I stopped saying that. I know how to do this. It's a funny cartoon.
[9613.74s -> 9633.11s]  Oh, what? Hold on. You're putting on Spongebob's underwear.
[9639.66s -> 9666.76s]  I don't know about that. Why does everything explode? Oh, almost fucked it up. But I'm there.
[9667.96s -> 9680.20s]  I like that guy. That's my favorite character in Spongebob. I think so.
[9684.66s -> 9693.35s]  Twenty one hundred dollars. That seems like a lot. What is going to open? Rebuild the bridge.
[9696.55s -> 9709.74s]  Oh, I have no. Holy shit, I almost missed it. Oh, what the fuck happened?
[9726.57s -> 9730.33s]  That guy just grabbed me. That was. Maybe there's no reason for that.
[9731.13s -> 9747.19s]  See those baits right there? That's bullshit. Just do it. Just kill me. How did I miss that?
[9747.19s -> 9769.58s]  I don't know. I just picture somebody sitting at their computer right now like
[9771.74s -> 9786.38s]  like just laughing at me. Give me the fucking thing. What did I win? Did I get what I needed
[9786.38s -> 9806.68s]  to get? I didn't. I need to get the antenna. I get the box though, right? That was just for
[9806.68s -> 9819.48s]  the bonus. Oh, well, did I miss a box? I don't think I did. Back where you started. Well,
[9819.48s -> 9840.71s]  at least I got a spatula. Oh, you can get hit in the air and you lose your jump.
[9847.90s -> 9856.86s]  They are laughing. I picture with like any of you in the same room. You're all just
[9857.42s -> 9860.94s]  fracking the fuck up after when I get hit by even when I get hit by an enemy.
[9866.49s -> 9870.09s]  I don't know why, but for some reason you guys are playing some like old fucked up stupid game
[9870.09s -> 9875.74s]  like trouble. I'm just on in the background and you catch it every now and then you guys just all
[9875.74s -> 9892.89s]  fucking start laughing your asses off and when it's a bad happens to me. Let's not screw this
[9892.89s -> 9913.50s]  up. Please. No, don't I don't need to do that. I just do it. You just go a different way.
[9920.44s -> 9925.27s]  I'm going to wait. I'm going to wait. No, no, no, no. I know I'm at the crosswalk right now and I
[9925.91s -> 9930.71s]  I'm not taking that chance. No, I'm not going to win the hand. I got nine seconds. When the
[9930.71s -> 9935.27s]  hand starts popping up, I'm not fucking running. I'm just going to wait till the next cycle where
[9935.27s -> 9941.13s]  I can cross the crosswalk. Not going to happen. Then you start to go like, oh fuck, I got to get
[9941.13s -> 9952.76s]  over there quick as fast as I fucking can. See now I got a full time here. Man, I did it again.
[9953.40s -> 9963.05s]  What are you just fucking?
[9964.14s -> 9992.41s]  Better. The fuck am I? You're going to hit by a train. You were. I know I was here before,
[9992.41s -> 10007.50s]  but where's this bridge? I was getting rid of a bridge. Where's this? I got to get the antenna.
[10008.95s -> 10034.39s]  I got to go up higher than this. Exactly. I'm pretty good at it. I've got, I've got like 10
[10034.39s -> 10068.10s]  years of experience pretending to be bad at video games. So come on. Yeah, but I wanted to see what
[10068.10s -> 10082.41s]  was over there. I want to see what was over there. Wait, can I get your ass? I can. I don't think I
[10082.41s -> 10091.06s]  can make that one though. So what? Just get your own underwear. I don't, I don't get that thing.
[10091.06s -> 10101.59s]  I don't understand that. This is really weird. Where is SpongeBob's underwear? Get, put on your
[10101.59s -> 10118.79s]  own underwear. That just tried to tell me. Get across large gaps, lasso, and then glide.
[10119.59s -> 10153.77s]  The hell is it trying to say? Oh, I did it. Any more? Nope. Defeated. Sorry, I had to do it.
[10155.53s -> 10160.98s]  What does this do? What's the trampoline down? Is he going to jump on it? Come on, jump on it.
[10160.98s -> 10204.02s]  And Sandy sneak? Checkpoint. That's going to be an issue then. I can't even. That was the checkpoint
[10204.02s -> 10213.05s]  from Cruisin' USA. Yeah, it was. You're incredibly perceptive. And just because you got that, I'll
[10213.05s -> 10224.54s]  give you my best intro. Cruisin' USA. Not very good, but I tried. Come on, better make good use
[10224.54s -> 10270.84s]  all these. That was wicked cringy. Don't talk shit to me. You can lasso the red ones. Can I?
[10271.56s -> 10278.90s]  Jerma cringe compilation. I, you know what? I wonder what that would actually look like.
[10280.82s -> 10287.64s]  You know what I really have to say about that? Here's what I actually have to say about that.
[10289.80s -> 10296.84s]  I think you'd probably get to like Jerma cringe compilation 60 before you ran out of clips. I'm
[10296.84s -> 10319.06s]  being honest. And I have to be honest. Watch. Come back. Yeah. They would be scraping the barrel by
[10319.06s -> 10326.65s]  10. You know, thank you. That means a lot. That means that this, you don't think, wasn't prepared
[10326.65s -> 10339.45s]  for that. That means that there's only like six hours worth of cringe. Stop going on this trampoline.
[10351.54s -> 10370.42s]  What would that even look like? I really want to know. Part of me wants to know what that looks
[10370.42s -> 10400.89s]  like. There's a lot to go through though. Go have people make cringe compilation videos of me and
[10400.89s -> 10406.95s]  watch them. I feel like that's levels of self-deprecation. I'm not sure I want to
[10406.95s -> 10414.28s]  cross. Do you know what I mean? Like that's like, oh, hey guys, let's watch. Let's watch like the
[10414.28s -> 10434.09s]  most cringy shitty things I've ever done. Isn't that funny? Maybe. So what is this box?
[10435.19s -> 10447.51s]  Oh, I'm going to be cringe night. Don't do that to yourself. No, I'm not going to do that to myself.
[10447.51s -> 10463.83s]  I don't want to know. Travel to the lighthouse, but to anything else I can do here. That's easy.
[10463.83s -> 10475.90s]  Just play the whole wow stream. Are you ready? Kids set. Oh, what? You can't say, are you ready?
[10475.90s -> 10506.98s]  Kids and not have the next thing be, I can't hear you that go shit. So this must be how you open up
[10506.98s -> 10534.97s]  the door. Isn't that hard? No fun. Game gets, or hits a huge difficulty spike after the real first
[10534.97s -> 10555.43s]  block. Didn't I fight the first boss already? I'm the first boss, the squid, but that was a mini
[10555.51s -> 10577.38s]  boss. Oh, out of here. How many more of these do I need? I need two more.
[10582.97s -> 10592.41s]  You on the other hand, I want you to explode, but I got a purple one in there too. I don't forget
[10592.41s -> 10597.48s]  the button. I just make it sure that I get this. I don't want to hit this button and teleport out
[10598.04s -> 10632.07s]  the button. Dude doesn't do anything. I feel like a new sponge. It was a sock.
[10632.31s -> 10648.98s]  Let's wait. What was there? Did I miss a sock? It was a trampoline. Oh shit. I hit it and then I
[10648.98s -> 10652.42s]  didn't notice anything immediately. And I looked over chat and somebody said nothing. Two people
[10652.42s -> 10656.50s]  said like nothing, nothing. LOL. And I'm like, okay, it must be nothing. Two people said it out of
[10656.50s -> 10675.93s]  9,000. Uh, let's go back to Sandy. How many, uh, I've got 16. I think I want to check out the other
[10676.73s -> 10705.32s]  area. There's two other areas I can go to now. Or should I go get the antenna for Larry the antenna?
[10719.90s -> 10739.66s]  I like jumping around. It's a lot of fun. It makes me feel happy. I would have just jumped into the
[10739.66s -> 10753.61s]  box. All right, Larry, SpongeBob dream levels are pog. I hope you get that far. All right. I
[10753.61s -> 10759.37s]  get Larry to the top, right? I can finally watch those reruns of the, but I already fixed it.
[10760.17s -> 10766.60s]  Nevermind. I already did it. Yeah. I'm going to let me try one of the other areas.
[10767.32s -> 10783.03s]  Dream levels are awesome. Okay. Kini bottom. Oh, look at that. You get, this is
[10784.82s -> 10812.82s]  SpongeBob's closet. Let's just go to SpongeBob's closet and go to sea needle. What's the one with
[10812.82s -> 10838.18s]  15? It's over here. Travel to the Poseidon. Okay. Cool. Lagoon or Poseidon. Oh yeah. Turn in the socks.
[10842.22s -> 10857.11s]  Here's your golden back scratcher. I don't speak Italian. Oh yeah. I got, I got lots of money.
[10857.67s -> 10864.47s]  This isn't money. So do you want to trade shiny objects for a golden spatula? Yeah. That's quality
[10864.47s -> 10880.92s]  craftsmanship. I do it again. So do you want to trade? Yes. I have less than a thousand bucks.
[10881.56s -> 10905.42s]  I wonder how many times you can do that. I'm going to the Poseidon. 126,000 for all those. Holy
[10905.42s -> 10942.60s]  shit. This is the real first boss. Oh shit. I got to sit up then. Whoa. Wait for the bounce.
[10949.93s -> 10955.77s]  Like that. And then in the head. I get it. I know what to do.
[10956.73s -> 10968.26s]  I don't, I don't get it. I don't know what to do. I don't understand. Oh, that's the bounce.
[10968.26s -> 10975.70s]  But will he get the drop on the robot? That's the bounce. That's the bounce.
[10977.46s -> 10986.02s]  Get off my screen. Get off my screen you fucking like 10 sub stream labs notification. Get out of
[10986.02s -> 11004.87s]  here. Oh, that was a good job. Bad execution. Cause I was trying to pay attention to the boss.
[11006.23s -> 11015.03s]  That was slowly slow to come out. Get out of here. You bad 10 sub notification. Oh, watch out for
[11015.03s -> 11038.01s]  Sandy. I did get the drop. Do it again. I get it now. It's like the robots left itself vulnerable.
[11038.09s -> 11044.14s]  That's taking a beating out there. I wasn't even doing this thing.
[11049.90s -> 11076.23s]  Oh, phase two. Do I tag him in? Bounce and throw the head. What does that mean? Bounce and throw
[11076.23s -> 11086.14s]  the head. So I have to like just wait. Everybody's wearing his underwear.
[11086.14s -> 11104.97s]  Throw the head into, uh, into the electricity.
[11112.28s -> 11115.88s]  Right back on her head. Just give it back.
[11127.00s -> 11133.48s]  And there we go. Nice flying, uh, head thing move by Patrick.
[11133.48s -> 11142.26s]  There's a swole spongebob in the background. Where? Shit, there is. Oh wow.
[11143.06s -> 11153.69s]  That's losing its head. Now it's Sandy's turn. This is the last phase coming up.
[11153.69s -> 11163.00s]  I've never seen such an electrifying match. How does Jerma manage to read some comments?
[11164.86s -> 11169.02s]  That's how Jerma manages to not know, uh, where he's standing half the time.
[11169.66s -> 11177.03s]  So Jerma gets to the same spot he's been to three times and doesn't remember he was there.
[11186.95s -> 11195.00s]  Wait. Oh, I got to hit you right in the chin. He's talking in third person again.
[11195.00s -> 11223.21s]  Mom, he's talking in third person again. Not the top bro. Not the top bro. Finally did it.
[11248.87s -> 11292.42s]  Boss defeated. What does it do? That's pretty pogchamp. He still says the whole thing.
[11293.56s -> 11294.92s]  He still says the whole thing.
[11309.78s -> 11312.66s]  Where are the subtitles? They're on. They're right here.
[11335.11s -> 11340.47s]  No, not really. I was waiting for someone to say it. Exactly. And as your non-friend,
[11340.47s -> 11345.59s]  I dropped like a few, I dropped 300 frames just real quick and I was waiting for a fiber,
[11345.59s -> 11357.54s]  like F fiber high. He's got fiber lab out loud. Tell you what I'm going to do for you. This way
[11357.54s -> 11362.26s]  you won't hurt yourself and you can just keep working on getting me into the jump bucket.
[11363.06s -> 11370.71s]  I already said, don't stop using a VPN. It's snake oil. You're the best non-friend,
[11371.43s -> 11375.27s]  don't you understand? I've committed to a point where it has to be real.
[11375.99s -> 11393.11s]  I've committed to a point where it needs to be real. Very cool. So that was just a single boss
[11393.11s -> 11401.24s]  fight, huh? Oh, wait, I, wait, I, this is where she lives. She's that close. I thought she lived
[11401.24s -> 11412.23s]  like in another city. Wait, this is blowing my mind. Sandy lived right here, like right down
[11412.23s -> 11428.57s]  the street. I thought she lived like 10 to 20 miles away. Holy shit. This isn't cannon.
[11451.72s -> 11463.82s]  Are you ready kids? Let's go. Oh no. He turned it from SpongeBob. Hold on. I don't want to lose.
[11463.82s -> 11469.26s]  I only have, that's a long time. Nevermind. I think as many jokes as you want, Jeremy.
[11469.26s -> 11479.18s]  Talking in third person again. Things he's talking to himself somehow. I don't know what
[11479.18s -> 11508.17s]  he's doing. It's been pretty long. Go for an oh, tartar sauce cloud.
[11511.75s -> 11520.65s]  Maybe when I get, maybe later. That was the easiest spatula of the whole game.
[11521.45s -> 11530.33s]  Wait, isn't this where the, I don't need it. Don't need it. I definitely don't need it.
[11531.05s -> 11535.37s]  He's sitting right here, right? He's like, I don't need it. I don't need it.
[11539.16s -> 11548.39s]  He freaks out. I don't know what happens after that. All I know is I've seen the GIF
[11549.11s -> 11552.39s]  like a thousand times. I don't know what happens after that. I've never seen the episode.
[11552.39s -> 11565.61s]  SpongeBob's a cool little guy, Annie. Can I do anything else in here? Of course I've seen the
[11565.61s -> 11589.26s]  episode. Can I go actually in the tree? Let me teach you how to bowl a bubble. Press this button
[11589.26s -> 11595.34s]  and you'll bowl a bubble that can knock down robots from a safe distance. Wow. Really? Remember
[11595.34s -> 11601.02s]  though, the bubble ball only works on things that are close to the ground. Got it.
[11601.82s -> 11618.23s]  From a joke, it's 342, guys. I, I know what it was. 342. That's in like 30 minutes. Nice. That's
[11618.23s -> 11641.03s]  cool. Charging it goes, but yeah, it goes faster. 40 to go over here. I'm assuming that's probably
[11641.03s -> 11669.67s]  end game. Golden factuals to enter, to unlock. 30. Go to goo lagoon. It's cool.
[11669.67s -> 11672.81s]  All right. I'll go to goo lagoon. Well, wait, I want to, let me go,
[11673.85s -> 11683.22s]  let me go inside of this building. What is this? Oh shit. There's nothing like the smell of bubbles
[11683.22s -> 11698.50s]  in the morning. What did that do? There's a timer. Oh shit. Let's go. You're going to catch me with
[11698.50s -> 11707.56s]  that one. Didn't you? Yep. You almost did. Yeah. That's sunshine flashbacks for sure.
[11708.12s -> 11730.31s]  Let's go in the police station. Okay. Now give me, there's gotta be a spatula in every single
[11730.31s -> 11738.39s]  building. All right. It has to be. I think bottom most wanted it. Oh, it's, it's just, it's a,
[11738.39s -> 11775.80s]  it's a bestiary. Oh, these things. We'll get the golden underpants. I'll get it. Ready?
[11776.68s -> 11784.02s]  Why is every spamming a link? First link spam. We're coming back. First actual link spam. What
[11784.02s -> 11794.20s]  is it? This is, I'm intrigued. Hold on a second. This is first purple, like just huge wave of purple
[11794.20s -> 11819.64s]  links. That's pretty good. That's, that's worth showing. I think. Nice. Okay. Come on, let's get
[11819.64s -> 11827.64s]  this. Get this mouse off the screen. Okay. So like where's this golden underpants is up here.
[11829.86s -> 11835.86s]  Yeah, it is right here. Extra health slot. Can I get up there?
[11838.42s -> 11852.95s]  I just was able to break the game and go past that without 40. Oh, I got an extra health pot.
[11854.31s -> 11861.02s]  Why does it want me to turn into a ball here? I can't figure this part out.
[11861.02s -> 11879.02s]  I'm a quick show staking. I could go for one right now. Actually, not kidding for real.
[11879.18s -> 11887.03s]  We don't do that stuff anymore, kid. We're retired. Is that the TV repairman?
[11887.75s -> 11896.17s]  No, it's that excited sponge kid again. Oh, are you sure he can't fix the TV?
[11897.83s -> 11905.11s]  Fake voice. Not real voice. Twidby, my greatest honor to come fix the TV.
[11906.55s -> 11911.91s]  I would have done that for 50 bucks. Hey, sponge kid, you really want to help out?
[11912.87s -> 11921.80s]  Okay, then. But lighten up a bit on the enthusiasm, huh? You're making my bowels act up.
[11922.84s -> 11929.48s]  We've got a link. Only one link for 10 minutes. Are you sure you're up to this task? Absolutely,
[11929.48s -> 11940.07s]  barnacle boy. Well, go to the couch to access the Mermalair. Wait, there's a whole Mermalair?
[11954.39s -> 11960.55s]  You're a fake fan. 10 minutes have not passed. No, it has not.
[11970.36s -> 11976.50s]  Go over to the couch and we'll go to the mermaid lair. Wait, we can watch TV?
[11977.70s -> 11980.50s]  Oh, I thought we could watch an episode of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
[11988.74s -> 11990.50s]  What's his shoe size? 13.
[12012.17s -> 12034.25s]  What the fuck are you watching, man? Enter the Mermalair. Yeah, it's everybody's dream to go to
[12034.25s -> 12063.35s]  the Mermalair. Wait, what's going on down here? This looks corrupting. All right, I'm gonna die.
[12064.15s -> 12073.54s]  I've already done it like twice. I don't need to do it again. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
[12077.72s -> 12081.32s]  You shouldn't sneak up on Mermaid Man like that. His heart's not so good.
[12081.88s -> 12086.20s]  Come to think of it, nothing on him is that good anymore. Sorry, Mermaid Man.
[12086.28s -> 12090.84s]  It's just that I'm always so excited to see you two. Standing in your awesome presence gives me
[12090.84s -> 12095.72s]  the chills of justice. See, I've got goosebumps on my goosebumps on my goosebumps on my goosebumps on
[12095.72s -> 12102.36s]  my. All right, kid, knock it off. Just tell us what you want. What a great character. Well,
[12102.36s -> 12108.10s]  I really want a new pair of sunglasses. Patrick sat on my old ones. That's not what I meant.
[12108.10s -> 12120.89s]  Actually, it's a good thing you showed up, young sponge of goodness. It is. It is. A bunch of
[12121.53s -> 12131.29s]  evil robots have taken over the Mermalair security system. It's up to you to shut it down and stop
[12131.29s -> 12140.73s]  them. Well, why him? We're perfectly capable superheroes. Because it's Thursday and we have
[12140.73s -> 12149.16s]  a whole bunch of doctor's appointments. Fish sticks. I forgot. Go talk to the Mermalair computer
[12149.16s -> 12157.75s]  in the next room. She'll tell you what you need to do. Accept this awesome responsibility, Mermaid
[12157.75s -> 12170.06s]  Man. You won't be disappointed. To the doctor's office. Away. Did somebody just say LOL Bernie
[12170.06s -> 12191.93s]  Sanders? Why is every voice Bernie? That wasn't Bernie Sanders. That wasn't even close.
[12193.93s -> 12213.96s]  Oh, there's another Bernie. Everybody's not Bernie. Oh, I'm going to die. Bernie, LOL, you normie
[12213.96s -> 12227.00s]  loser. What the fuck is going on here? Wait, don't let me read this. Don't step on the red squares
[12227.00s -> 12238.50s]  off the disco floor. Why not? Wait, hold on. Let me process. Let me just let me process.
[12239.22s -> 12263.00s]  Did you say that Bernie was normie? What? What? I'm trying to figure out what that means.
[12281.90s -> 12295.91s]  Get out of here. Got him back. You missed that one.
[12310.63s -> 12330.49s]  You're in such a shitty spot. Just get out of here. So bad. Why am I trying? No, you're right. I'm
[12330.49s -> 12335.94s]  going to let that one stick here because I'm trying to knock them back at him. Bounce them,
[12335.94s -> 12340.02s]  throw them back at him. And it worked a couple of times. So I was like, Oh, that's just what I'm
[12340.02s -> 12355.64s]  supposed to do. So yeah, I don't, I don't. Yeah. Can I spin this? You can use bubble ball to turn
[12355.64s -> 12370.12s]  paddle wheels. Ball one side of this paddle to make a turn. So I'm making that up. Okay. He wants
[12370.12s -> 12397.13s]  me to go this way. Can I turn this on? Your chair is about to break. 15 minutes until it's funny.
[12404.36s -> 12412.62s]  This is going to be like a, oh, damn it. Shit. It's still possible. Is it though? No, it's not.
[12413.90s -> 12418.60s]  Fuck. Fuck. Important. This is very important. Seriously. This is the most important thing in
[12418.60s -> 12421.96s]  the whole stream. We only have a few minutes to do this. I need somebody to go back to like,
[12422.60s -> 12425.96s]  uh, I need somebody to go back to the first like fucking 40 minutes of the screen.
[12426.92s -> 12431.16s]  And I need something. I need to, I need to, I need something that I said that I can use this
[12431.16s -> 12435.40s]  like a puzzle for the Vaude watchers. When I say, Hey, welcome. You're paid Vaude watchers. Here you
[12435.40s -> 12444.02s]  are. Okay. I need you to go back and we need to get the secret code from one hour and 41 minutes.
[12444.02s -> 12452.12s]  Right. If you can decipher the code, meet me at four hours and 22 seconds. You know what I mean?
[12452.12s -> 12456.60s]  Let's make like a fucking stupid game for the Vaude watchers. I need like a, a one line that
[12456.60s -> 12468.31s]  we can, I can refer back to it. 342. I need an exact time period for this as well. I'm not clicking
[12468.31s -> 12477.83s]  that. It has to be something that was like at least two hours ago. Colgate thing. What was the
[12477.83s -> 12492.84s]  exact time for Colgate? Okay. Like if you can, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like go, go. Hey guys,
[12492.92s -> 12500.95s]  go back, go back to one hour in 42 minutes. And if you can find me a C a certain name
[12503.54s -> 12506.90s]  that will decipher that. No, it's gotta be, okay. Dave Colgate, right?
[12508.62s -> 12515.59s]  D is ABC. That's three. A is would be one. That's three, one shit. It doesn't work out.
[12519.10s -> 12527.40s]  I need something like a, something that, uh, damn it. ABC D is four. D is four. D is not three.
[12527.40s -> 12539.88s]  Okay. That works. That's four, one. So V would be 20. So that's 22, four, four hours and 12
[12539.88s -> 12554.18s]  minutes. E, A, B, C, D, E, four hours, 10, 12 minutes and five seconds. Cause then four hours
[12554.18s -> 12564.14s]  and 12 minutes. It's like, Hey, you solve the puzzle. How can you say so much without saying
[12564.14s -> 12572.86s]  anything? Somebody, all right, let me pause this. I want the Dave Colgate to be the, I, what I tell
[12572.86s -> 12578.01s]  them to go back to. And then when they get the Dave, I, they need to figure out the secret code
[12578.65s -> 12585.37s]  to find the timeframe to skip to. Cause the Dave would be the code would be the time in the Vaude.
[12586.01s -> 12599.90s]  That's what I'm saying. Yes. Dave equals the time like for the Vaude and like ABC D would be for
[12599.90s -> 12617.82s]  the fourth letter of the alphabet. So that's our four. You understand what I'm saying? Oh, wait,
[12618.46s -> 12623.02s]  the A would be one. How are you not getting the corresponding? What are you talking about?
[12632.04s -> 12637.40s]  Yeah. Four, somebody got it. Four, one, two, two, five, four hours.
[12643.56s -> 12659.14s]  Okay. So in minutes and seconds, that's four, 12, 25. Yes. All right. Okay. Here's what was the
[12659.14s -> 12675.08s]  exact timeframe that I started talking about Dave Colgate. One, 14, 32. I need an exact time.
[12689.30s -> 12728.49s]  What is he doing here? What would have been worst joke 2020? It didn't even happen yet.
[12729.37s -> 12752.25s]  Can I blow this? I have to be Patrick for this. Where's the bus?
[12774.39s -> 12775.51s]  Actually really isn't that good.
[12792.49s -> 12793.37s]  No, I'm not doing it.
[12793.37s -> 12817.03s]  It was still putting in a fucking image. Hey, what the fuck? Oh, the 10 minute
[12817.03s -> 12825.70s]  cool down ended. Right. Right. Right. Right. Dave Colgate bit starts at 58 minutes in the Vaude.
[12826.42s -> 12879.24s]  Okay. Hold on. I have to beat this part. What the hell? It's not on a timer, right?
[12879.24s -> 12884.58s]  No. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[12884.58s -> 12893.29s]  wait. 5740 is exactly where it starts. All right. Steakums. This is okay. I'm going to show this
[12893.29s -> 12907.77s]  just because I want, I, why do I have to, why would I show this? I'm going to, but like,
[12907.77s -> 12915.86s]  why would I do this? By the way, good luck getting your Steakums to look like that and be like that.
[12916.58s -> 12934.60s]  It's very hard to do. Okay. Let's do it again. This one's going to be the hard one.
[12934.60s -> 12972.89s]  It's not that hard. That wasn't that hard. It's when you just walk. All right. Mermaid man. Now what?
[12981.72s -> 12986.44s]  Well, for a joke that sucks so bad, it seems like a whole lot of you can't wait for it to happen.
[12986.44s -> 13024.15s]  Give me that spec. Incoming worst joke of the year. You, no, stop. You're getting in my head.
[13024.71s -> 13047.85s]  Holy shit. This is a huge, this goes way up. I'm going to stick with SpongeBob.
[13059.50s -> 13064.54s]  There's nothing like the smell of bubbles in the morning. It smells like victory.
[13065.34s -> 13088.04s]  Just don't get knocked off. Should I've, I couldn't have stayed in Patrick. That
[13088.04s -> 13117.11s]  isn't how that works. Wait, is there a dog? Why is it a dog? That guy was making dog sounds.
[13117.11s -> 13138.84s]  Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What the hell was that slide?
[13138.84s -> 13155.32s]  It is a slide. I got it. Got the purple one. Oh, whoa. Bridge activated. Nice.
[13156.20s -> 13178.87s]  I got the bridge active. I can destroy this. Whoa. Shit.
[13178.87s -> 13193.62s]  Move, move, move, move. Don't watch out for that. I don't want to get hit by that.
[13196.44s -> 13199.48s]  I don't want to, I got to stand here for a second. I don't want to get the,
[13199.48s -> 13202.44s]  the dude's going to come over here and he's going to, Hey, what's going on? Vod watcher.
[13203.78s -> 13210.68s]  Welcome. You made it to the third step of the puzzle. Now the trickiest part of the entire game
[13210.68s -> 13216.36s]  so far is you're going to have to go back, back to the beginning, at least somewhere in the first
[13216.44s -> 13223.48s]  hour. And you're going to need to find the name that was said. It was a first and last name that
[13223.48s -> 13230.44s]  was said. And once you figure that out, you're going to have to go to the timestamp that you
[13230.44s -> 13235.88s]  can decipher the code for the timestamp from that name. And if you can figure it out, you're going
[13235.88s -> 13255.38s]  to find yourself a prize. Good luck. Not going to give them the, you think I'm going to give them
[13255.38s -> 13263.38s]  the time? No. Telling them, Hey, go to, go to fifth. They might still be here. Get out of here.
[13264.34s -> 13269.62s]  Go do the puzzle. Don't stick around here. Don't go do the puzzle. Get the fuck out of here.
[13273.32s -> 13289.56s]  Oh, all right. If I say the exact time, then it defeats the purpose of the puzzle.
[13297.83s -> 13305.98s]  All right. So what if they're still here? I can't even say the time. I can't say the actual,
[13305.98s -> 13316.81s]  okay. I, wait, there's no more VODs, right? There's no more VOD chat anymore, right? There is.
[13317.62s -> 13345.58s]  Shit. Oh fuck. How do I, can I turn the chat off from VODs? VOD chat stopped a year ago. Wait,
[13345.58s -> 13365.05s]  but did it? I missed a button. Shit. No, it didn't. You just can't type in it anymore.
[13373.75s -> 13396.39s]  Delete the VOD. You can't even do anything. I just can the whole thing. Fuck it. It didn't work out.
[13396.39s -> 13405.77s]  Hey, by the way, the prize, I'm just going to scream in my room at the exact second.
[13408.50s -> 13412.26s]  I know the exact time. I'm going to just stand it back there. I'm just going to scream like into
[13412.26s -> 13434.34s]  the wall at the exact second that it happened. Okay. I didn't hit that. I thought I could make it
[13434.34s -> 13461.21s]  play copyrighted music. So the VOD gets me. Um, I can't go back to the stream from like an hour
[13461.21s -> 13467.61s]  ago and play copyrighted music. Oh, that was such a huge brain thing to do when we were talking
[13467.61s -> 13473.45s]  about it. God damn it. What a huge brain thing. I could have put on, I could have put on
[13474.33s -> 13488.92s]  that copyrighted music while we were talking about it. Oh well. The first one is here.
[13492.76s -> 13497.64s]  When you have pressed them all, you should return here to press the master shutdown button.
[13497.72s -> 13498.52s]  Just redo it.
[13502.49s -> 13506.81s]  Return here. Got it. Are you listening to me?
[13508.81s -> 13513.46s]  Listening. Got it. Well, at least the people in the archive channel can have fun.
[13515.16s -> 13533.32s]  Right. Really should have been paying attention to that. What that said. Can you say it again?
[13534.36s -> 13539.51s]  Press all of the security override buttons throughout the murmur. Okay.
[13539.51s -> 13549.08s]  Press all of them. Is there another one that I didn't get?
[13549.72s -> 13555.21s]  Press the master shutdown button to lower the bridge to the villain containment system.
[13604.23s -> 13608.63s]  Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. What is it? Give me the good one. Give me the one that everybody
[13608.63s -> 13618.07s]  wants me to click on. Give me the good one. I don't know. I don't think this is it.
[13621.34s -> 13624.78s]  I don't. I just clicked on one that I don't. I think that is wrong.
[13625.58s -> 13631.19s]  Jerma Patrick.
[13635.27s -> 13641.69s]  Okay. This is good. This is worth it. This is actually worth keeping on, by the way, for a while.
[13642.41s -> 13673.77s]  This is the wrong one. How could that be wrong? It's great. He's a both good.
[13674.66s -> 13707.48s]  Oh, did I see Jerma Patrick deep fake? You can't deep fake my face onto Patrick's face. That's
[13707.48s -> 13721.46s]  not how it works. You can't do that. Can somebody do it? Can somebody deep fake me onto Patrick?
[13721.46s -> 13742.52s]  Somebody has to try. Even if it looks like shit. You guys are just like adding people.
[13743.08s -> 13762.50s]  Do not underestimate the power of the chat. Yeah, that's right. Anytime you underestimate
[13764.10s -> 13780.87s]  chat, it comes back to bite you. Click on the actual Imgur link. Why am I Patrick?
[13786.04s -> 13833.38s]  I wonder. Patrick's a moron. That's what it is, right? Let's continue. Patrick is a fan favorite.
[13834.02s -> 13841.46s]  He's my fan favorite. Yes, I know. I love Patrick. He's my favorite character.
[13863.37s -> 13871.19s]  Before season four. After season four, it was Mrs. Puffs. No, that's not true. It was Mrs. Puffs
[13871.19s -> 13890.25s]  always. Mrs. Puffs always. Electrical grid? What's this?
[13890.25s -> 13891.61s]  It's like a spring breeze.
[13903.34s -> 13908.44s]  You know what I thought of recently? You know what was the greatest job on earth?
[13909.40s -> 13914.76s]  It had to have been the greatest job on earth. Is being the guy that played the rock and roll piano
[13915.64s -> 13924.66s]  way back in the day. Because you just had to mash like four keys at the same time over and over
[13924.66s -> 13949.34s]  again. Just go while somebody else went. I would have loved to do that job. And you get to stand
[13949.34s -> 13957.46s]  up and you can just be like, you're like, everyone's cheering you on. And then you move a little bit to
[13957.46s -> 13969.30s]  the right. You got a big jacket on. There's like a bunch of flare all over it and shit. You look
[13969.30s -> 13998.92s]  awesome. I would have hammed that up like crazy. Did somebody just say that? I'm trying to read
[13998.92s -> 14023.98s]  fast and play. Let me say the DMT is kicking in. Oh, don't die. Wait this. Okay. Hold on.
[14023.98s -> 14043.27s]  He's shooting missiles. It's not fair. Did it hit me? Oh, whoa. Whoa. Oh, they knew I was going
[14043.27s -> 14084.26s]  for the underwear. Just get this. Wait, open it. Oh, I get to go up. Did I get the other
[14084.26s -> 14096.52s]  teleport box? Penis is showing. That's okay. The camera's not on. Whatever. I don't know why.
[14097.88s -> 14123.94s]  I want to go up there. Oh, there's spatula at the end of this. That better be.
[14130.81s -> 14151.86s]  I think that's the last of our friend's SpongeBob. By the way, don't fucking run or anything.
[14155.37s -> 14183.50s]  Sorry. Fuck. This is why I have my mic turned down. For those of you that are asking, why is
[14183.50s -> 14202.82s]  the stream always so low? Because anyways, before I had that little problem there,
[14205.56s -> 14213.13s]  I was going to say the last two streams have been like monster stream. There was like 15,
[14213.13s -> 14218.17s]  fucking thousand people at the other one. There was like at the peak here, there was like 9,
[14218.17s -> 14228.79s]  9,400, 9,500. That's crazy. This is just a huge amount of people have been hanging out
[14228.79s -> 14247.59s]  the last few streams. All right. Let me get this. Let me get this. Wait for the cycle.
[14249.14s -> 14297.48s]  That cycle. I just damage hit damage. No, I can't. It's all this for a sock. Oh, there we go.
[14300.09s -> 14327.03s]  Ooh, this is called rolling. Finally. All right. Okay. Okay. Spatula is right there.
[14332.89s -> 14337.96s]  Uh, I mean, let's go get that first.
[14342.79s -> 14352.98s]  Boy, there's, I see my eyes. Am I going to play chess? That's not going to happen ever.
[14355.90s -> 14361.94s]  I, I think the only time I've ever really played, I don't even know where the, how the characters
[14361.94s -> 14369.48s]  move. I know the pawns can move one or two spaces forward. I know that the horse can move in an L.
[14370.04s -> 14375.18s]  I don't even know how many spaces. I just know it's an L. I know that the,
[14375.98s -> 14383.94s]  the Bishop with the thing with the crown on it can move in all the way diagonally. And then I
[14383.94s -> 14393.32s]  know that they're the king and the queen. They can move any direction. I always just get the
[14393.32s -> 14398.20s]  queen out there and just get the queen killed. So I get, I lose every time. I just get so impatient
[14398.20s -> 14402.04s]  that I just know that the queen's like a super assassin, like really cool character to come out
[14402.04s -> 14407.24s]  with. And like, I just take the queen out all the time just to go like on like assassin missions.
[14407.24s -> 14414.82s]  And she just dies. I'm like, I'm sick of this. I don't want to move in an L. Where's the queen?
[14415.78s -> 14429.69s]  With a great big ball. Impatient. Yeah. I can't play chess. No way.
[14444.81s -> 14450.74s]  Here's how to win at chess. Call everyone who beats you a cheater. How do you cheat at chess?
[14451.62s -> 14460.86s]  You're like extra pieces in your pocket.
[14470.26s -> 14479.58s]  So this is like mouse trap, huh? Move the pieces of machinery along the track.
[14480.14s -> 14483.45s]  Well, this is going to be horrible. I can already tell. Let's see what happens.
[14489.13s -> 14512.46s]  Oh no. All right. So then it has to go. Okay. And then come on. Hurry up. How do I make this move?
[14522.97s -> 14531.98s]  He's smarter than a fifth grader. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait a minute.
[14531.98s -> 14536.66s]  I didn't even get a look at it all. This, I don't even know why these things all happen.
[14537.30s -> 14550.94s]  How do I get the hammer to move down? Wait, wait, hey, hey, how did that happen?
[14550.94s -> 14558.92s]  Did I just throw a ball at it? Oh, what the hell? Okay. And what does that do?
[14559.72s -> 14582.25s]  Oh, this thing's set up. All right. Let's go. Have you missed? How are you missing?
[14583.05s -> 14620.07s]  Get it! Blaming SpongeBob. Ready. Here it comes. Okay. Then it's going to get scooped up and then
[14620.07s -> 14626.50s]  it's going to get placed up there and then it wraps around. Okay. Scoop successful.
[14631.29s -> 14648.26s]  Now it's going to go around here and then end up down here. It's going to get scooped up there
[14653.00s -> 14667.03s]  and then it's going up here. Okay. Then it goes that way. That's going fast.
[14708.28s -> 14718.82s]  It's exhausting pretending. Scoop it already. Come on, man. Oh, I'm going to have to do this again.
[14719.54s -> 14739.61s]  Come on. There's timing on. Where'd he go? Shit. I think I fucked it up again. Hey!
[14742.97s -> 14743.69s]  What the fuck?
[14750.94s -> 14767.02s]  Way too early. All right. It's to go around the whole damn thing.
[14771.16s -> 14802.22s]  What is it? Oh, that was dumb. What the hell happened? Yeah. What happened there? Whatever.
[14802.22s -> 14807.03s]  This is the one. I agree. I think this actually is the one.
[14851.69s -> 14900.63s]  Yeah, this is the one. Got it. Fuck. Okay. I thought the arrows were talking about like,
[14900.63s -> 14906.98s]  I like you like tilt this, tilt it. Well, look, you got to tilt it around and get it in the middle.
[14906.98s -> 14912.14s]  Those old stupid toys. I thought it was like tilt, tilt, tilt it around. You get it in the
[14912.14s -> 14934.07s]  middle. I didn't. Okay. Shit. I thought it was just like, oh, get it in the hole.

[15029.54s -> 15059.75s]  possible and your prize. Congratulations. By the way, I just did that into my chair
[15059.83s -> 15077.56s]  and I've been sitting on this for four hours. I was like, I don't want to scream because that's
[15077.56s -> 15094.47s]  way too loud. I'm like, I got to muffle it somehow. Okay. I can't laugh this hard.
[15096.76s -> 15148.14s]  All right. I got to relax. Like hairs in my mouth. Ow. I have a dog.
[15148.14s -> 15166.54s]  I was thinking, do it into my hand. That won't muffle it enough. There's no pillow in here.
[15166.54s -> 15171.78s]  There's nothing in here. I have to like scream. There's like a cushion here. Oh my goodness.
[15172.82s -> 15187.24s]  What the fuck is wrong with me? I can't even talk about it.

[15476.15s -> 15513.06s]  minutes for an extra special surprise. I can't even fucking believe it. I can't believe it. I
[15513.06s -> 15520.17s]  can't believe it. What am I going to do? I can't fucking believe it. I can't believe it. It's not
[15520.17s -> 15526.17s]  hard. It's not hard. It's fucking easy. It's why did I say fucking like that? It's fucking easy.
[15526.17s -> 15538.14s]  No, it's easy. Just do it. It's not even hard. It's a simple puzzle. It's just a simple thing.
[15538.14s -> 15557.59s]  You just have to time it right. Like that's a lot of you guys right now. Just like, I'm just
[15557.59s -> 15634.60s]  going to sit down. Yep. He'll get it eventually. Oh, he did it. Now how's about giving old Mr.
[15634.60s -> 15642.52s]  Krabs that shiny gold. I'll give you a promotion. A promotion. Sure. You'll get a whole extra 10
[15642.52s -> 15648.92s]  seconds added to your break time. Oh, a whole extra 10 seconds added to your break time.
[15650.68s -> 15656.28s]  No, I'm sorry Mr. Krabs. As enticing as that sounds, I can't give this to you. I need every
[15656.28s -> 15662.92s]  golden spatula I can get. Mine was worse probably. I understand boy. I'll just dock 30 seconds from
[15662.92s -> 15674.78s]  your break time instead. That means I have a negative break. Thanks Mr. Krabs. That was just
[15674.78s -> 15690.23s]  for one spatula by the way. Oh, I'm so defeated. Mine is 20. What's going on here? Why are you guys
[15690.23s -> 15719.78s]  fucking with the algorithm? Why are you guys fucking with the algorithm? Why are you guys
[15720.34s -> 15730.81s]  welcome? You made it Vaude Watcher. Your secret prize is to go back to exactly
[15733.35s -> 15744.02s]  61 minutes and if you can tell me the name of the first letter that comes up at the first moment
[15744.02s -> 15751.19s]  that you hear the sound of me talking, you're gonna... I don't care. Just watch the rest of the
[15751.19s -> 15757.46s]  stream. Just watch the rest of the stream. I don't care anymore. It was fun until like
[15758.02s -> 15761.69s]  10 words into that sentence. Hope you had fun.
[15770.49s -> 15784.76s]  Where's my prize? Oh no, he hates us. Stop doing minus 20 you fucking with the algorithm.
[15788.01s -> 15796.49s]  Uh, what am I missing? What are you guys doing? Stop doing that. You're gonna break my computer.
[15797.29s -> 15816.68s]  Did I talk to the computer again? It was a joke in the game. Oh, well the joke in the game is
[15816.68s -> 15834.84s]  affecting me in real life. Press all of the security override buttons throughout the murmur layer,
[15834.84s -> 15851.85s]  then return here. So what the heck? What am I missing over that way? I missed a button. What?
[15852.81s -> 15867.58s]  Where? Probably up. All right, if you see a button, let me know. Please tell me. All right,
[15867.58s -> 15890.30s]  get all that and then over there. It's right there. Press that one. Whoa, there's an oyster.
[15891.02s -> 15901.46s]  I didn't have enough money to open this one. How many do I have? Oh, what did I spend all the money
[15901.46s -> 15932.14s]  on? It was on another clam. All right, let's just farm. We're gonna farm just for a minute.
[15932.14s -> 15960.84s]  Just for a minute. Just for a minute. Hey, VOD watchers, go watch Vine Compilations instead.
[15961.72s -> 15969.42s]  Why would you say that? You're putting my stream under Vine Compilations? Come on.

[15998.23s -> 16014.04s]  How do I make that jump? I just said that the VOD watcher probably wouldn't see it unless you...
[16014.04s -> 16036.49s]  Yeah. Uh-oh, they started counting. This is extreme scenario. This is an extreme scenario.
[16036.49s -> 16041.99s]  Uh-oh, I might have to pull out. I might have to pull out fucking big guns here.
[16042.55s -> 16055.86s]  I might have to pull out the big guns. Wait, how do I get this? How do I make this jump? Like over

[17910.34s -> 17917.38s]  want to go look these things I want to look at I know face cam I don't really
[17917.38s -> 17923.43s]  do face cam only sometimes when I'm feeling really cocky and confident
[17923.43s -> 17941.58s]  that's when you'll see it turned on fields this is blue lagoon right
[17941.58s -> 17953.11s]  somebody wanted me to all right we'll do that next I have 30 now when there's
[17953.11s -> 17964.67s]  something else yeah over here when naming a character Dave Colgate leads to
[17964.67s -> 17981.09s]  you leading dog ass hair weird yeah Sand Mountain all right he's look this
[17981.09s -> 17992.87s]  okay this is the one I want to do okay all right so here's the plan I'm gonna
[17992.87s -> 18000.58s]  give you guys the kind of next streaming days as you know I'm still trying to
[18000.58s -> 18007.55s]  ease back into streaming sitting here for more than four or five hours fuck me
[18007.55s -> 18014.25s]  up uncomfortable but there's some other things I'm gonna do too to help with
[18014.25s -> 18021.24s]  that I just got this desk like not even a year and a half ago and it's
[18021.28s -> 18027.73s]  unfortunate that I have to say this but sitting down sucks so I'm probably going
[18027.73s -> 18036.90s]  to just invest in a really really just good standing desk so that's something
[18036.90s -> 18043.24s]  I'm gonna do too eventually I can find something else somewhere else to put
[18043.24s -> 18054.53s]  this one I like this desk a lot and one that goes up and down yeah that's the
[18054.53s -> 18060.63s]  idea is like maybe I could have one that is I could sit down at it for a few
[18060.63s -> 18063.43s]  hours and then all right let's get them I got to get the fuck up and stand up
[18063.43s -> 18073.25s]  for like another couple hours stand-up comedy yeah so if you don't know I'll go
[18073.25s -> 18077.09s]  over this again just because I've only talked about it once so I as well talk
[18077.09s -> 18083.01s]  about it again I'm going back to the pre Vegas streams which is I'm only gonna be
[18083.01s -> 18088.67s]  live like three days a week and those streams are gonna be somewhere like this
[18088.67s -> 18095.05s]  around like five hours five ish four to six ish hours the end of the stream
[18095.05s -> 18100.24s]  wind down is going away we're not gonna do any bit readings at the end of the
[18100.24s -> 18105.88s]  streams anymore and it was a hard thing to do it was a hard thing to remove but
[18105.88s -> 18112.88s]  it means that I can sit here for as long as I can and long as I really want to
[18112.88s -> 18118.14s]  comfortably without needing to potentially add another hour or so to
[18118.14s -> 18126.82s]  stream to go over the bits and talk and hang out and stuff but that's sort of
[18126.82s -> 18129.94s]  the thought process there and it's probably going to be pretty permanent
[18129.94s -> 18134.85s]  because I've been gone for two months trying to get this figured out and this
[18134.85s -> 18139.77s]  could just be a longer term scenario where I have to just manage whatever is
[18139.77s -> 18144.54s]  going on I'm optimistic still though but there's something just random and stupid
[18144.54s -> 18148.74s]  that it's gonna be oh wow that's real fucking dumb huh it was that the whole
[18148.74s -> 18154.02s]  time here's how you fix it I'm still pretty optimistic about it so we'll see
[18158.39s -> 18164.57s]  but with that being said I'm going back to the kind of pre Vegas I almost said
[18164.57s -> 18172.57s]  pre Vegas arc a lot of you guys say that no going back to pre Vegas stream times
[18172.57s -> 18182.38s]  and lengths so I'll see you guys I will be back I'll see you guys on probably
[18182.38s -> 18188.52s]  probably the middle of next week either on Tuesday or Wednesday and at that point
[18188.52s -> 18192.85s]  I'm gonna try to do two days in a row I'm gonna try to do Wednesday and
[18192.85s -> 18200.12s]  Thursday in a row see how that plays out how to do maybe Wednesday Thursday
[18200.12s -> 18211.65s]  Saturday one day Thursday Sunday they'll see then I'll update the sus tomorrow
[18211.65s -> 18221.28s]  the next day I figure out which one's gonna be wins movie night yeah we'll
[18221.28s -> 18225.71s]  talk for a little bit streams are not just gonna turn off obviously they still
[18225.71s -> 18231.28s]  have the credits to do I don't do my mom gonna be reading bits or anything but
[18231.28s -> 18237.59s]  we are gonna hang out for about ten minutes or so don't worry so do that now
[18237.59s -> 18246.39s]  oh where's the music I got it there it is movie night is gonna end up being I
[18246.39s -> 18252.73s]  gotta come up like there's a lot of streams that are on the way here that I
[18252.73s -> 18259.01s]  really have to set hard dates for the DLC movie night is on Wednesday I'll
[18259.01s -> 18264.10s]  give you a hard date it's gonna be within the next ten days that's pretty
[18264.10s -> 18268.89s]  much a guarantee that it within the next like 10 to 15 days and then there's the
[18268.89s -> 18274.98s]  webcam stream there's FTK August is gonna be there's a lot of stuff going on
[18274.98s -> 18280.22s]  it'd be fun we're probably gonna have to break it down into more than
[18280.22s -> 18286.42s]  potentially two or even three nights because you guys have had months and
[18286.42s -> 18290.50s]  months and months to work on projects we're probably gonna have to put some
[18290.50s -> 18296.66s]  criteria in maybe some changes on like the second or third night maybe I don't
[18296.66s -> 18299.06s]  know well I'll have to figure it out I want to try to get as many things seen
[18299.06s -> 18308.39s]  as possible but yeah let's run the credits these are all the subs today
[18308.39s -> 18318.64s]  there was a lot of major sub drops thank you I when I went when I left back in
[18318.64s -> 18326.73s]  the end of May another end of May yeah wait was it May when did I leave yeah
[18326.73s -> 18333.67s]  holy shit it was it was May wasn't it it's been almost two and a half months
[18333.67s -> 18343.14s]  well I'll just tell you just for full just just transparency here you guys in
[18343.18s -> 18347.98s]  the last two three days have brought the sub count of the stream back to where it
[18347.98s -> 18361.47s]  was before I left that's fucking crazy in three days it's like all like all of
[18361.47s -> 18365.71s]  you came back and decided to resub like I can't even fucking comprehend that and
[18365.71s -> 18371.95s]  people that were still subbed to the channel for the months that there was
[18371.95s -> 18385.26s]  nothing here that's even harder to believe so thanks that's it's incredible
[18385.26s -> 18389.70s]  to think about that that like I I I'm gonna try to use the money as best I can
[18389.86s -> 18397.89s]  because obviously that that's a concern right like when anytime you if I you go
[18397.89s -> 18401.01s]  away for a little while I go is but people gonna remember who I am am I
[18401.01s -> 18404.93s]  gonna I'm gonna come back and people are gonna how many people are gonna be there
[18404.93s -> 18409.84s]  will that be will I lose a shitload of people if I go away for three four
[18409.84s -> 18414.89s]  months or something I'm gonna my channels gonna die but it didn't even
[18414.89s -> 18419.61s]  it didn't even fucking happen there are more people watching now than before
[18419.61s -> 18431.47s]  I can't believe it who is this guy who is this guy who are you who who who are
[18431.47s -> 18446.65s]  you omega low who are you what who omega low wait am I getting hooded in my own
[18446.65s -> 18466.48s]  stream that's so funny now I long story short I'm forever grateful that you
[18466.48s -> 18470.21s]  guessed all all of you pretty much came back and then something because it was a
[18470.21s -> 18481.94s]  concern to have and you you smashed it thanks guys we'll see you gonna we'll
[18481.94s -> 18488.34s]  see you on probably Tuesday Wednesday we run the credits we're gonna do
[18488.34s -> 18493.85s]  spongebob again I'm gonna beat it and then on Thursday I have the Riddick
[18493.85s -> 18499.10s]  games I really want to play but I also mmm I wonder if I want to just do the
[18499.10s -> 18514.62s]  webcam streams if I can get that see if I can get it to work where are my
[18514.62s -> 18523.61s]  credits make it better this whole streamer thing do the webcam one yeah I
[18523.61s -> 18529.37s]  did look into after stream from two days ago I did look into it more I think it's
[18529.37s -> 18539.77s]  a little more elaborate than I think I'm gonna have to add some peripherals but
[18539.77s -> 18543.35s]  here comes credits these are all people that subbed today it's doing the Star
[18543.35s -> 18561.32s]  Wars thing again so this is very obviously broken this one is not gonna
[18562.32s -> 18573.48s]  okay so let me get the other one because the other one actually works is it the
[18573.48s -> 18585.69s]  same ten people from last time I think it's the same people yeah it has to be
[18585.69s -> 18601.18s]  only those people sub yeah all right let me pull up the other one right it's
[18601.18s -> 18644.63s]  okay okay you know what I really really desperately need I have to set up I have
[18644.67s -> 18652.22s]  to set up like a new button to press get like a window it's killing me it's like
[18652.22s -> 18656.18s]  half the time it doesn't capture my window and like I sit here trying to do
[18656.18s -> 18663.42s]  browser source and then capture a window and shit really annoying I should just
[18663.42s -> 18680.82s]  be able to do this I think my computer just sucks I think I've come to the
[18680.82s -> 18705.79s]  tournament yeah come to the realization I think this computer just sucks hi not
[18705.79s -> 18718.07s]  what I wanted don't get that off hey get out of here oh shit they can see
[18718.07s -> 18731.17s]  everything oh they can see everything look at this window look at brother
[18731.17s -> 18738.53s]  source three oh no oh no you can see all my fucking look at this you can see all
[18738.53s -> 18746.59s]  my shitty command center image one image three germs sandwich
[18746.63s -> 18764.13s]  yeah you're my and Jax top bits top bits too I don't even know what these are
[18764.13s -> 18781.76s]  what is sandwich you all know the honest-to-god stupid truth about this
[18781.76s -> 18788.50s]  whole thing that was probably the image name and file of a fucking picture that
[18788.50s -> 18796.75s]  somebody gave me to show on stream seven months ago and it's just still down here
[18796.79s -> 18807.63s]  that's so embarrassing this is so embarrassing it's not doesn't exist
[18807.63s -> 18810.71s]  anymore it like has to exist in the folder I can't it doesn't it won't show
[18810.71s -> 18818.98s]  up on stream it's the Mick chicken picture yeah now that does it's not
[18818.98s -> 18821.94s]  attached to anything it's not all it's not in the same spot where it was six
[18821.94s -> 18831.64s]  seven months ago it's been moved okay anyways let's go ahead and do this oh we
[18831.64s -> 18839.78s]  could see his command center oh you guys got to see behind the curtain and how
[18839.82s -> 18848.53s]  shitty my actual streamers set up is an image three how many people were here
[18848.53s -> 18867.78s]  today here we go let's do it here come the credits I gotta get this fixed for
[18867.78s -> 18893.44s]  next time here they come and they're in alphabetical order we finally get to see
[18893.44s -> 18918.98s]  his command center my eyes hurt when is the rumble the rumble really kind of got
[18918.98s -> 18926.90s]  just thrown it just in a total total just dizzy the original plan for the
[18926.90s -> 18932.52s]  rumble was it was gonna be a charity stream to sponsor my buddies run in the
[18932.52s -> 18936.40s]  Boston somebody hold on a minute that person it was Jerma seven seven five
[18936.40s -> 18940.84s]  when the dudes talk with it was Jerma seven eight five what was that
[18940.84s -> 18949.60s]  Jerma seven nine five all right well if that person starts streaming you know you
[18949.60s -> 18955.44s]  know we talked about it anyways the it was supposed to be a
[18955.44s -> 18960.00s]  charity stream for the Boston Marathon it was gonna sponsor my buddies run in
[18960.00s -> 18963.90s]  the Boston Marathon it was a whole charity set up there was a whole page
[18963.90s -> 18969.68s]  that was ready and they canceled the marathon the Boston Marathon is has
[18969.68s -> 18976.87s]  been just canceled so it really was like oh I now like I'm gonna do another one
[18976.87s -> 18985.84s]  I do it maybe two of them just don't know it's all this was before obviously
[18985.84s -> 18996.12s]  COVID-19 you had this plan for a little while before that but that's kind of
[18996.12s -> 19001.16s]  what happened to that it was supposed to happen in September and that stream
[19001.16s -> 19013.56s]  was supposed to happen months ago but there will be another rumble promise
[19013.56s -> 19020.84s]  it's not like I don't think about it all the time so there are tons of ideas and
[19020.84s -> 19030.10s]  tons of things I want to do yeah I oh I yeah I pinky promise absolutely there's
[19030.10s -> 19034.62s]  other fun stuff to do as well though all right I'll see you guys on probably
[19034.62s -> 19039.60s]  Wednesday I had a lot of fun spongebob's it's I love this game I think it's
[19039.60s -> 19042.72s]  really good I'm glad you guys made me play it cuz I wasn't gonna play it
[19042.72s -> 19056.08s]  unless you told me to wait until WWE 2k 21 I don't think I want to do it in one
[19056.08s -> 19063.22s]  of those games I think I really would go back painfully somehow they're like 2k
[19063.22s -> 19069.36s]  14 or maybe even stay on the current year that I'm on now where this a lot
[19069.36s -> 19076.91s]  of the characters already are as manned I refuse to buy that new 2k 20 whatever
[19076.91s -> 19085.93s]  the one that just came out this past year now I refuse to buy it shit no it
[19085.93s -> 19096.16s]  is it is shit 2k 14 is the best yeah now I know and the problem with 2k 14 is
[19096.16s -> 19103.14s]  just it takes so fucking long to do anything 2k 14 it just you'll make a
[19103.14s -> 19108.57s]  character you'll load up a character and you'll put a layer on them you'll put
[19108.57s -> 19115.46s]  two layers on them three layers on them and then the game starts to go for you
[19115.46s -> 19126.39s]  load a piece of clothing it's the worst I wish and this is so horrible that they
[19126.39s -> 19135.08s]  didn't do this it was so close 2k 14 just didn't make it to the ps4 they
[19135.08s -> 19142.44s]  waited to make that new 2k 15 right was the first one and if they had I wish
[19142.44s -> 19147.93s]  they just made 2k 14 the one for ps4 because it was really close right it was
[19147.93s -> 19164.78s]  like not even a year right it's Alex yeah a little right it's Alex what's he
[19164.78s -> 19170.81s]  doing see what he's up to let's see let's see what he's doing
[19170.81s -> 19185.65s]  they have slowed down but the battle for Texas is just the toughest on two mobile
[19185.65s -> 19189.56s]  teams in here for a second I was like wait what was it how is this italics
[19189.56s -> 19210.22s]  a stream I think pub G he's playing he's playing total war warhammer 2 not subbed
